1
00:00:15.677 --> 00:00:18.722
(mellow piano music)

2
00:00:32.861 --> 00:00:35.614
(thunder storms)

3
00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:47.310
- Detective Keating.

4
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.229
You know me, we've been here before.

5
00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.690
I did not murder this woman.

6
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.651
And after 14 hours of
grilling me on Christmas Eve,


7
00:01:54.651 --> 00:01:56.403
what more could you possibly learn?

8
00:01:57.237 --> 00:01:58.947
- And you think blowing smoke
up my ass for another 14 hours


9
00:01:58.947 --> 00:02:00.949
is gonna get me off my game?

10
00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:04.160
- One must have a game
before one can be thrown off.


11
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.415
- I know you killed Mrs. Egosia.

12
00:02:09.332 --> 00:02:12.043
- I didn't.
- Tell me where the body is


13
00:02:12.043 --> 00:02:14.045
and I might be able to
get you second degree.


14
00:02:14.045 --> 00:02:16.548
- Exactly why would I
entertain that scenario


15
00:02:16.548 --> 00:02:19.300
even if I was guilty,
which of course I'm not?


16
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.262
Every single one of
you has come at me.

17
00:02:22.262 --> 00:02:24.347
Duke, Diane, now you.

18
00:02:25.765 --> 00:02:27.225
And what has come of that?

19
00:02:27.225 --> 00:02:28.768
Nothing, zero, zippo.

20
00:02:29.644 --> 00:02:34.649
- Ashley Smith, Tara Webb, Susan Fedyk

21
00:02:35.817 --> 00:02:39.612
Carrie Fox and now Mary Egosia.

22
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:43.783
The only thing they all
had in common was you.


23
00:02:45.368 --> 00:02:50.373
All had flat tires, all serviced by you.

24
00:02:53.877 --> 00:02:55.795
You're not fooling anyone.

25
00:02:55.795 --> 00:02:57.213
We know you killed them all.

26
00:02:59.382 --> 00:03:01.217
But why don't you do yourself a favor?

27
00:03:01.217 --> 00:03:04.262
Admit it so we can
all get out of here.

28
00:03:09.434 --> 00:03:10.268
- You are good.

29
00:03:10.268 --> 00:03:12.604
You almost had me believing
I murdered those women.


30
00:03:15.023 --> 00:03:18.401
- So we're just gonna keep sitting here.

31
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:19.778
- Sure.

32
00:03:19.778 --> 00:03:21.279
I got no place to be.

33
00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:23.531
- Well then why don't
you ask for a lawyer,


34
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:24.532
so I can get out of here?

35
00:03:24.532 --> 00:03:25.658
I got presents to wrap.

36
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.204
- I'm enjoying myself.

37
00:03:29.204 --> 00:03:30.538
I'm sorry you're not.

38
00:03:32.373 --> 00:03:34.751
Besides, second degree is for losers.

39
00:03:39.631 --> 00:03:40.507
- I want a coffee.

40
00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:42.300
You want one?

41
00:03:46.012 --> 00:03:46.846
- Sure.

42
00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:52.477
- What do you want?

43
00:03:52.477 --> 00:03:53.436
- I need your help.

44
00:03:53.436 --> 00:03:55.105
- Sure if it gets me off
his desk for a little bit,


45
00:03:55.105 --> 00:03:55.980
what you need?

46
00:04:03.613 --> 00:04:04.656
- Sorry about the coffee,

47
00:04:04.656 --> 00:04:06.741
but you're not gonna be here
long enough to drink it.


48
00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.162
You know what, you're good.

49
00:04:11.162 --> 00:04:14.207
It turns out that you
didn't kill those women.


50
00:04:14.207 --> 00:04:15.583
- Damn right, I didn't.

51
00:04:16.876 --> 00:04:19.170
- We have the real killer
in custody downstairs.


52
00:04:20.213 --> 00:04:21.131
You're a free man.

53
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:25.802
Is this it?
- That's it.


54
00:04:25.802 --> 00:04:27.387
Signed, sealed and delivered.

55
00:04:27.387 --> 00:04:28.304
If you need anything
else, I'll be downstairs.


56
00:04:28.304 --> 00:04:30.056
Detective, Chief and I will
be holding a press conference.


57
00:04:30.056 --> 00:04:31.432
- Okay?
- What's his name?


58
00:04:32.433 --> 00:04:34.769
- Congratulations, you are free to go.

59
00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:36.729
- You tell me his goddamn name now.

60
00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:43.319
- His name is Derek Hall

61
00:04:44.195 --> 00:04:47.031
and he worked at the same road
service company that you did.


62
00:04:47.031 --> 00:04:48.950
- That is such bullshit.

63
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:49.951
- Not sure what you mean,

64
00:04:49.951 --> 00:04:52.579
but you are free to go back
to your life of obscurity


65
00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:53.788
and in about 20 minutes,

66
00:04:53.788 --> 00:04:57.208
Derek Hall's name will be world famous.

67
00:04:57.208 --> 00:04:59.502
- No, no, no, no.

68
00:04:59.502 --> 00:05:01.004
That should be my name.

69
00:05:01.963 --> 00:05:04.716
Whoever you've got down
there is a goddamn liar


70
00:05:04.716 --> 00:05:08.928
and if anybody's gonna be famous, it's me.

71
00:05:08.928 --> 00:05:12.515
He didn't kill anybody, I did.

72
00:05:12.515 --> 00:05:15.643
- And after 18 hours, why am
I supposed to believe you?


73
00:05:15.643 --> 00:05:18.479
- Well, because if you
went to my mountain cabin,


74
00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.315
you didn't know about that, did you?

75
00:05:20.315 --> 00:05:22.275
And checked in the basement,

76
00:05:22.275 --> 00:05:25.111
you would find every
single one of the bodies


77
00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:27.614
buried under the floor, you dumbass.

78
00:05:27.614 --> 00:05:30.074
- The mountain cabin outside Idlewild.

79
00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.995
- Yeah, we never had enough evidence

80
00:05:33.995 --> 00:05:35.121
to get a search warrant.

81
00:05:35.121 --> 00:05:37.790
But now, now I think we do.

82
00:05:41.377 --> 00:05:43.755
- We got him.
- Yeah.


83
00:05:45.006 --> 00:05:46.049
Damn right we did.

84
00:05:58.102 --> 00:06:01.189
- Detective, you have a
call holding on line four.


85
00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:02.023
- Thanks.

86
00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:12.575
(mellow music)

87
00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:27.131
(sirens wailing)

88
00:06:40.478 --> 00:06:42.438
- [Operator] All available
units in the area


89
00:06:42.438 --> 00:06:45.775
proceed to 122 Ryder Court.

90
00:06:45.775 --> 00:06:47.485
Neighbor has discovered a dead body

91
00:06:47.485 --> 00:06:48.945
outside the back of the house.

92
00:06:48.945 --> 00:06:51.614
Detectives and ambulance already in route.

93
00:06:53.283 --> 00:06:54.617
- Unit 42, code 3 on route.

94
00:06:56.828 --> 00:06:58.496
- I was just
out recently on a domestic,

95
00:06:58.496 --> 00:07:00.081
unit 71 code three in route.

96
00:07:02.333 --> 00:07:05.878
(camera shutters clicking)

97
00:07:13.511 --> 00:07:14.387
- [Woman] I could kill you.

98
00:07:14.387 --> 00:07:17.348
- Do it then.
- Liar.


99
00:07:17.348 --> 00:07:18.808
- [John] I'm obviously
not getting laid tonight


100
00:07:18.808 --> 00:07:21.394
so could all of you please just leave.

101
00:07:21.394 --> 00:07:22.729
- [Woman] Don't you want
to claw his eyes out?


102
00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:23.896
- No. No!

103
00:07:23.896 --> 00:07:26.316
- [Woman] He's cheated on all of us.

104
00:07:26.316 --> 00:07:28.026
- [John] Enough, just
get out, all of you.

105
00:07:28.026 --> 00:07:28.985
- [Woman] And what if we don't?

106
00:07:28.985 --> 00:07:30.278
- Then I'll kill you.

107
00:07:30.278 --> 00:07:32.071
- [Operator] 911.

108
00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:34.365
- I would like to report
a domestic disturbance.


109
00:07:40.788 --> 00:07:42.248
- This is not good, Diane.

110
00:07:42.248 --> 00:07:43.499
Have you seen the latest polls?

111
00:07:43.499 --> 00:07:45.126
Antonette is within three points.

112
00:07:45.126 --> 00:07:46.252
- Yes, I saw them

113
00:07:46.252 --> 00:07:47.712
and trust me when I tell you,

114
00:07:47.712 --> 00:07:49.756
we have our best detectives on it.

115
00:07:49.756 --> 00:07:51.257
- Not to mention that the victim's mother

116
00:07:51.257 --> 00:07:54.010
is all over the news,
screaming for justice.


117
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.428
- Everyday that goes by,

118
00:07:55.428 --> 00:07:57.096
means less and less of a chance

119
00:07:57.096 --> 00:07:59.974
they'll find those monsters
that killed my son.


120
00:07:59.974 --> 00:08:02.018
John was such a good boy.

121
00:08:03.102 --> 00:08:05.396
This never should have happened.

122
00:08:05.396 --> 00:08:07.815
I'm just praying for justice.

123
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:09.942
- Yes, I'm aware.

124
00:08:09.942 --> 00:08:13.613
- So what are we doing about it?

125
00:08:13.613 --> 00:08:15.740
- I said, I'm working on it.

126
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.409
- So what are we doing about it?

127
00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:20.328
John Davis was murdered.

128
00:08:21.412 --> 00:08:23.706
There are a lot of donors
in Grenier Park, Diane.


129
00:08:23.706 --> 00:08:24.874
Do I need to elaborate?

130
00:08:25.708 --> 00:08:28.127
It's time for you to go
and gets Scott Keating.


131
00:08:29.295 --> 00:08:30.129
- It's not possible.

132
00:08:30.129 --> 00:08:31.756
- Don't tell me it's not possible.

133
00:08:31.756 --> 00:08:35.218
Scott got a serial killer to
confess after only 18 hours,


134
00:08:35.218 --> 00:08:37.428
something you guys weren't
able to do for years.


135
00:08:37.428 --> 00:08:39.722
- Do I need to remind you
that Detective Keating


136
00:08:39.722 --> 00:08:40.973
has not been back to work

137
00:08:40.973 --> 00:08:43.184
since the night he broke Clifford Daisley.

138
00:08:45.895 --> 00:08:46.729
- How's he doing?

139
00:08:47.939 --> 00:08:49.065
- To be honest, I'm not sure.

140
00:08:49.065 --> 00:08:51.275
- Well, maybe it's time we found out.

141
00:08:51.275 --> 00:08:53.277
If you ask me, 
Diane it's been too long.

142
00:08:54.153 --> 00:08:56.030
Keating isn't depressed anymore.

143
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.991
He's just, I don't know, in a funk.

144
00:08:58.991 --> 00:08:59.826
(laughing)

145
00:08:59.826 --> 00:09:00.660
- You're a doctor now.

146
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.661
- A talent like his

147
00:09:01.661 --> 00:09:03.913
has been on the sideline long enough.

148
00:09:05.289 --> 00:09:08.167
- Duke Brown is here.
- Send him in.


149
00:09:10.294 --> 00:09:12.338
- This is first degree murder, Diane.

150
00:09:12.338 --> 00:09:14.090
It's not a traffic violation.

151
00:09:15.383 --> 00:09:16.676
Want to shake up the tree?

152
00:09:17.969 --> 00:09:19.846
Get Scott Keating.

153
00:09:19.846 --> 00:09:22.515
Now if you'll excuse me, I
have a luncheon to attend.


154
00:09:23.933 --> 00:09:24.767
- Of course.

155
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.520
- Detective.
- Mr. Mayor


156
00:09:33.276 --> 00:09:34.110
- Have a seat.

157
00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:38.030
- Guess the Mayor's
not in a good mood.

158
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.407
- Is he ever?

159
00:09:40.575 --> 00:09:42.201
- I think the
night he won his election

160
00:09:42.201 --> 00:09:43.870
is the last time I saw him happy.

161
00:09:44.829 --> 00:09:45.830
- I got to tell you, dude,

162
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.167
nothing frustrates me
more than cases like this.


163
00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:50.460
- Frustrates you, huh?

164
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.961
- It's been a week since the questioning.

165
00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:53.087
Is there anything new?

166
00:09:54.255 --> 00:09:55.256
- Unfortunately, no.

167
00:09:55.256 --> 00:09:56.716
- Well then unfortunately,

168
00:09:56.716 --> 00:09:58.759
politics is getting in the way.

169
00:10:01.596 --> 00:10:03.639
Mayor wants me to bring in Scott Keating.

170
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:06.767
- That's a mistake.

171
00:10:06.767 --> 00:10:10.980
- Maybe, but it's my
call and I'm doing it.


172
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.773
- And who knows if he
even wants to come back?


173
00:10:12.773 --> 00:10:15.818
- True but he is the best interrogator

174
00:10:15.818 --> 00:10:17.153
that this office has ever had

175
00:10:17.153 --> 00:10:19.655
and this might be the
case to bring him back.


176
00:10:19.655 --> 00:10:21.199
- Really?
- Yes.


177
00:10:22.742 --> 00:10:23.576
- Maybe so.

178
00:10:23.576 --> 00:10:26.871
- Look, if you don't want
to be a part of this,


179
00:10:26.871 --> 00:10:28.539
there's the door.

180
00:10:28.539 --> 00:10:31.501
My back is up against it, my friend.

181
00:10:31.501 --> 00:10:33.961
So either you're with me or you're not.

182
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.714
- Come on, Diane.

183
00:10:36.714 --> 00:10:37.548
You don't have to go there.

184
00:10:37.548 --> 00:10:38.716
You know, I'm always with you.

185
00:10:38.716 --> 00:10:40.968
- Good, then get me the files

186
00:10:40.968 --> 00:10:42.512
on all three by
the end of the day,

187
00:10:42.512 --> 00:10:45.056
because I have a house call
to make in the morning.


188
00:10:55.066 --> 00:10:57.652
(mellow music)

189
00:11:04.158 --> 00:11:05.451
- Not answering the door?

190
00:11:07.787 --> 00:11:09.288
Not picking up your cell?

191
00:11:09.288 --> 00:11:11.123
- It's been on silent.

192
00:11:12.291 --> 00:11:14.210
- How you been?

193
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.836
It's been awhile.

194
00:11:15.836 --> 00:11:17.046
- What can I do for you, Diane?

195
00:11:18.297 --> 00:11:20.091
- Been watching the news at all?

196
00:11:21.175 --> 00:11:23.094
- No cable, no internet.

197
00:11:24.887 --> 00:11:27.765
- Three women are suspects in a murder,

198
00:11:27.765 --> 00:11:30.518
victim found in the home stabbed 17 times.

199
00:11:31.852 --> 00:11:32.687
- Why the three?

200
00:11:34.355 --> 00:11:37.567
- They found out they were all
dating him at the same time.


201
00:11:38.609 --> 00:11:40.903
Idiot drunk texted them for sex

202
00:11:40.903 --> 00:11:43.531
and when they showed up,
because all hell broke loose,


203
00:11:43.531 --> 00:11:44.824
cops were called.

204
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.618
Two weeks later, guy ends up dead.

205
00:11:49.036 --> 00:11:50.913
- Think one of them did it?

206
00:11:51.789 --> 00:11:53.583
- Right now, that's all that makes sense.

207
00:11:55.209 --> 00:11:56.836
- What do you want from me, Diane?

208
00:12:00.756 --> 00:12:03.801
- The mayor's asking
you to help us on this.


209
00:12:03.801 --> 00:12:05.136
I'm asking you to.

210
00:12:07.305 --> 00:12:09.515
And in this file is
everything you need to know


211
00:12:09.515 --> 00:12:10.600
to bring you up to speed.

212
00:12:13.102 --> 00:12:14.645
- I see why the three
would be mad as hell,


213
00:12:14.645 --> 00:12:19.191
but murder just for
cheating, it's kind of thin.


214
00:12:19.191 --> 00:12:20.526
- Duke Brown's convinced.

215
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.196
- You got Duke Brown on the case?

216
00:12:25.656 --> 00:12:27.867
Yeah, he's a good detective.

217
00:12:27.867 --> 00:12:30.786
How long did he interrogate
them before you released them?


218
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:33.080
- How do you
know we let them go?

219
00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.206
- Come on, Diane.

220
00:12:34.206 --> 00:12:36.792
You wouldn't be here if
they were still in custody.


221
00:12:36.792 --> 00:12:38.836
- Nine and a half hours.

222
00:12:38.836 --> 00:12:39.879
We saw that they'd had enough

223
00:12:39.879 --> 00:12:43.758
so we turned them loose
before they lawyered up.


224
00:12:44.842 --> 00:12:45.676
- Evidence?

225
00:12:46.761 --> 00:12:48.095
- Crime scene was pretty clean

226
00:12:48.095 --> 00:12:51.849
besides blood and a ball of tape.

227
00:12:51.849 --> 00:12:56.562
- Yeah, well jealousy and anger
can be a deadly combination.


228
00:12:56.562 --> 00:12:58.856
- You got that right.
- Yeah.


229
00:12:58.856 --> 00:13:00.900
Victim have a name?
- Yes.


230
00:13:03.944 --> 00:13:04.987
John Davis.

231
00:13:15.873 --> 00:13:18.501
- It's been 540 days since
Molly and Jessica left me.


232
00:13:19.669 --> 00:13:21.962
Molly kept complaining
that I worked too hard.


233
00:13:23.255 --> 00:13:24.090
I can't help but thinking

234
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:25.716
that if I was
home on that Christmas Eve,

235
00:13:25.716 --> 00:13:28.678
instead of interrogating,
Clifford Daisley for 18 hours,


236
00:13:29.804 --> 00:13:31.138
things might've been different.

237
00:13:33.015 --> 00:13:36.936
But we got a
serial killer off the street,

238
00:13:36.936 --> 00:13:39.105
so that's something.

239
00:13:44.276 --> 00:13:46.112
- Yeah.

240
00:13:46.112 --> 00:13:51.117
Just so you know, Scott, it's
more than just something.


241
00:13:53.703 --> 00:13:54.912
It's way more than that.

242
00:13:58.332 --> 00:14:02.378
- Well, just leave the
file on your way out.


243
00:14:02.378 --> 00:14:03.379
I'll take a look.

244
00:14:09.385 --> 00:14:11.846
- Listen, if I didn't say so earlier,

245
00:14:11.846 --> 00:14:14.098
it's good to see you again.

246
00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.753
- Good morning, Alice.
- Good morning.


247
00:15:25.753 --> 00:15:27.004
- Messages?
- Yes.


248
00:15:27.004 --> 00:15:29.006
The banners and posters
are ready to be picked up


249
00:15:29.006 --> 00:15:30.841
at ABC Imaging.
- Oh, excellent.


250
00:15:30.841 --> 00:15:32.301
- The contracts came.

251
00:15:32.301 --> 00:15:33.677
- Great.

252
00:15:33.677 --> 00:15:35.221
And you have a potential new client.

253
00:15:35.221 --> 00:15:37.515
I already put them in your office.

254
00:15:37.515 --> 00:15:38.432
- A walk in.

255
00:15:38.432 --> 00:15:39.642
Yeah, his name is Greg Fuller.

256
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:48.526
- First suspect, Karen Jones,

257
00:15:49.443 --> 00:15:52.279
She's the owner of a
small advertising company.


258
00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:55.574
Karen and John had been
seeing each other the longest.


259
00:15:55.574 --> 00:15:58.202
She's tough and extremely smart.

260
00:15:59.078 --> 00:16:00.371
He pushed for them to get married,

261
00:16:00.371 --> 00:16:01.872
but she wouldn't marry someone

262
00:16:01.872 --> 00:16:04.500
who makes less money than her.

263
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.211
However, I'm sure it
didn't sit well with Karen


264
00:16:07.211 --> 00:16:09.964
when she found out he was
cheating with multiple women.


265
00:16:12.049 --> 00:16:13.801
- Good morning, Mr. Fuller.

266
00:16:13.801 --> 00:16:16.470
- Call me Greg.
- Karen Jones.


267
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:17.388
What can I do for you today?

268
00:16:17.388 --> 00:16:19.515
- Well, my brother and I
are opening up a restaurant


269
00:16:19.515 --> 00:16:21.225
in the Valley and we're
thinking about advertising


270
00:16:21.225 --> 00:16:23.394
on social media, radio,
that type of thing,


271
00:16:23.394 --> 00:16:25.604
and we hear that's something that you do.

272
00:16:25.604 --> 00:16:27.147
- Social media is my specialty.

273
00:16:28.357 --> 00:16:30.359
- Great, that's great.

274
00:16:31.527 --> 00:16:32.486
- What kind of restaurant?

275
00:16:32.486 --> 00:16:34.530
- Well, we haven't decided yet.

276
00:16:35.614 --> 00:16:37.575
But wait, Karen Jones.

277
00:16:37.575 --> 00:16:40.286
You were the girlfriend of
the guy that got killed.


278
00:16:40.286 --> 00:16:41.871
I read about it.

279
00:16:41.871 --> 00:16:44.373
I'm sorry about that.
- Thank you.


280
00:16:44.373 --> 00:16:47.376
I'd broken up with him two months prior.

281
00:16:47.376 --> 00:16:49.086
I had to read about it too.

282
00:16:49.086 --> 00:16:50.796
- How'd you feel when you found out?

283
00:16:54.425 --> 00:16:56.510
- Are we here to
talk about my love life

284
00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:59.221
or your ad campaign?
- I'm sorry.


285
00:16:59.221 --> 00:17:01.056
I can't do anything without
running it past my brother,


286
00:17:01.056 --> 00:17:03.142
but I always like to get a read

287
00:17:03.142 --> 00:17:05.144
on someone I might be working with.

288
00:17:05.144 --> 00:17:06.145
- Absolutely.

289
00:17:06.145 --> 00:17:09.648
- And I have a feeling that
you'll be seeing me again soon.


290
00:17:09.648 --> 00:17:10.858
- Looking forward to it.

291
00:17:11.901 --> 00:17:13.485
- It was a pleasure.
- All mine.


292
00:17:17.698 --> 00:17:18.616
Exciting.

293
00:17:18.616 --> 00:17:20.576
I'm looking forward to
handling your advertising.


294
00:17:20.576 --> 00:17:22.828
- The one thing I know,
we get the best effort


295
00:17:22.828 --> 00:17:25.497
from those that are
professional in their field.


296
00:17:26.332 --> 00:17:28.959
That doesn't mean that
there's an unlimited budget.


297
00:17:28.959 --> 00:17:30.377
- Absolutely.

298
00:17:30.377 --> 00:17:32.421
As we discussed, it's
all in your contract.


299
00:17:32.421 --> 00:17:33.255
- Great.

300
00:17:34.798 --> 00:17:35.966
- Remember me?

301
00:17:35.966 --> 00:17:37.092
Why'd you do it?

302
00:17:37.092 --> 00:17:38.218
- John, I'm in a meeting.

303
00:17:38.218 --> 00:17:39.887
- Why don't you stop payment
on the check you wrote me?


304
00:17:39.887 --> 00:17:41.096
I needed that money.

305
00:17:41.096 --> 00:17:43.724
- I can come back.
- No, no.


306
00:17:43.724 --> 00:17:45.976
- Good idea.
- Please, he's leaving.


307
00:17:45.976 --> 00:17:47.227
- I have all the information I need,

308
00:17:47.227 --> 00:17:49.605
I'll get back to my board
and I'll get back to you.


309
00:17:49.605 --> 00:17:50.814
- I am so sorry.

310
00:17:50.814 --> 00:17:52.232
I look forward to handling your account.

311
00:17:52.232 --> 00:17:53.233
- Yeah, yeah, later.

312
00:17:55.444 --> 00:17:56.987
- Are you that stupid.
- What?


313
00:17:58.364 --> 00:18:00.574
- You just lost me a six-figure deal.

314
00:18:00.574 --> 00:18:03.285
So I'll ask again, are you that stupid?

315
00:18:03.285 --> 00:18:05.955
- Why did you cancel
the payment you sent me?


316
00:18:05.955 --> 00:18:08.457
I told you I was gonna pay you
back on my deal went through.


317
00:18:08.457 --> 00:18:10.167
Now, I don't even have a deal.

318
00:18:10.167 --> 00:18:11.001
- After I wrote that check,

319
00:18:11.001 --> 00:18:13.087
I received a call from
my credit card company.


320
00:18:13.087 --> 00:18:15.714
It seems that someone
tried to withdraw $2,000


321
00:18:15.714 --> 00:18:17.341
from a casino ATM.

322
00:18:17.341 --> 00:18:19.677
Any idea who could have
stolen my credit card?


323
00:18:19.677 --> 00:18:20.636
- Are you accusing me of stealing?

324
00:18:20.636 --> 00:18:22.012
- I don't give a shit anymore, John.

325
00:18:22.012 --> 00:18:25.349
All I know is this, the bank
of Karen is closed for good.


326
00:18:27.393 --> 00:18:28.852
- You're gonna regret
you did this to me.

327
00:18:28.852 --> 00:18:30.104
- Get out of my office.

328
00:18:42.241 --> 00:18:45.411
- [Announcer] Anderson party,
court nine is now available.


329
00:18:51.083 --> 00:18:53.711
- Thank you, I'll see you next week.

330
00:19:00.426 --> 00:19:04.138
- Sarah Dobson,
professional ballet dancer.


331
00:19:04.138 --> 00:19:07.975
33, never married, no children.

332
00:19:07.975 --> 00:19:09.476
Sarah is part of a touring group

333
00:19:09.476 --> 00:19:12.479
performing the Nutcracker
Suite all over the world.


334
00:19:12.479 --> 00:19:14.481
John met Sarah about a year ago

335
00:19:14.481 --> 00:19:16.316
after a performance in Los Angeles.

336
00:19:16.316 --> 00:19:19.903
Sarah was the last
one to see John alive

337
00:19:19.903 --> 00:19:24.199
and her movie alibi the night
he was killed is a bit shaky.


338
00:19:26.452 --> 00:19:27.745
- A couple nice shots.

339
00:19:27.745 --> 00:19:30.205
- Thanks, did you see that
last one was terrible.


340
00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:32.207
- So you're relaxing or working?

341
00:19:32.207 --> 00:19:33.792
- No, relaxing actually.

342
00:19:33.792 --> 00:19:34.960
The owner who's right there.

343
00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.921
He's a nice enough to
let me come here and play


344
00:19:37.921 --> 00:19:39.590
when I'm not on tour, so.

345
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:40.424
- On tour?

346
00:19:40.424 --> 00:19:41.508
- Yeah, sorry.

347
00:19:41.508 --> 00:19:43.927
I'm a professional ballet dancer.

348
00:19:43.927 --> 00:19:46.138
- Oh, well that explains the gracefulness.

349
00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:47.514
- Oh, that's nice.

350
00:19:47.514 --> 00:19:50.309
Thank you.
- I'm Eddie Carmen.


351
00:19:50.309 --> 00:19:52.186
- Hi, I'm Sarah Dobson.

352
00:19:52.186 --> 00:19:53.979
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.


353
00:19:53.979 --> 00:19:55.522
- Wait a second, Sarah Dobson,

354
00:19:57.024 --> 00:19:58.525
the girlfriend of the guy who got killed.

355
00:19:58.525 --> 00:19:59.818
I read about in the paper.

356
00:19:59.818 --> 00:20:00.861
Must have been crazy.

357
00:20:02.321 --> 00:20:06.742
- Yeah, if you'll excuse me, I gotta...

358
00:20:06.742 --> 00:20:07.785
- I'm sorry.

359
00:20:07.785 --> 00:20:09.578
I didn't mean to offend you.

360
00:20:09.578 --> 00:20:11.955
You know, sometimes my
curiosity gets the best of me.


361
00:20:11.955 --> 00:20:13.916
- No, it's okay really.

362
00:20:15.501 --> 00:20:16.752
- You really must have cared about him.

363
00:20:19.755 --> 00:20:21.256
- Sorry.

364
00:20:21.256 --> 00:20:23.300
It was really nice meeting you.

365
00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.970
- Actually, I'm reporter
for a very popular blog.


366
00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.556
If you ever want to get
your side of the story out,


367
00:20:29.556 --> 00:20:30.724
look me up.

368
00:20:30.724 --> 00:20:32.142
- I appreciate that, thank you.

369
00:20:32.142 --> 00:20:34.228
- No worries.
- Take care of yourself.


370
00:20:44.571 --> 00:20:49.118
♪ Lord knows I
wrestle with my demons. ♪

371
00:20:59.128 --> 00:21:02.047
- Here you go Charlie.
- Thank you Cass.


372
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.343
- What can I get you?

373
00:21:07.761 --> 00:21:12.349
And finally there is Cassandra King, 46,

374
00:21:12.349 --> 00:21:14.685
single mother of one son, Jared King

375
00:21:14.685 --> 00:21:16.895
who's serving in Afghanistan.

376
00:21:16.895 --> 00:21:18.814
Cassandra's husband, 
Paul was killed

377
00:21:18.814 --> 00:21:22.109
trying to exit the North
tower during the 9/11 attack.


378
00:21:22.109 --> 00:21:25.195
Jared was only three at the time

379
00:21:25.195 --> 00:21:26.280
and Cassandra moved to California

380
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.116
and she now owns a
dive bar in the Valley

381
00:21:29.116 --> 00:21:30.868
and John and her met at the bar

382
00:21:30.868 --> 00:21:33.245
and have been on and off
for the last two years.


383
00:21:36.373 --> 00:21:41.336
- Yeah coffee.
- Yeah, just made a fresh pot.


384
00:21:41.461 --> 00:21:42.754
Cream, and sugar?

385
00:21:42.754 --> 00:21:45.757
- No, I'll just take a straight.

386
00:21:49.303 --> 00:21:51.346
- Here you go, uh...
- Eddie.


387
00:22:00.063 --> 00:22:01.523
- What?

388
00:22:01.523 --> 00:22:02.733
You know that schmuck?

389
00:22:02.733 --> 00:22:04.651
- No, I just
think it's kind of odd

390
00:22:04.651 --> 00:22:06.570
to have an article like that framed.

391
00:22:08.071 --> 00:22:09.781
- It's my claim to fame.

392
00:22:09.781 --> 00:22:12.701
I used to date that lying,
cheating, stealing SOB.


393
00:22:13.911 --> 00:22:14.745
- Oh yeah.
- Mh.


394
00:22:16.538 --> 00:22:20.292
- Do you mind if I-
- Read all about it?


395
00:22:26.256 --> 00:22:27.466
- You're Cassandra King.

396
00:22:28.425 --> 00:22:29.593
I've read this article.

397
00:22:29.593 --> 00:22:33.096
The police suspected you of murder.

398
00:22:33.096 --> 00:22:34.640
- Yeah, but I didn't do it.

399
00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.766
- So they cleared you.

400
00:22:35.766 --> 00:22:37.184
That's pretty good, huh?

401
00:22:37.184 --> 00:22:38.852
- Well, I don't know about all that.

402
00:22:38.852 --> 00:22:40.771
I just told him Sarah probably did it.

403
00:22:40.771 --> 00:22:43.732
The look on her face the
night we caught him, hoof.


404
00:22:46.151 --> 00:22:48.987
- "The victim John Davis was
caught by Cassandra King,


405
00:22:49.821 --> 00:22:53.283
Sarah Dobson and Karen
Jones all at the same time."


406
00:22:54.743 --> 00:22:55.702
- Yeah, it was
a hell of a night.

407
00:22:55.702 --> 00:22:57.955
(laughing)

408
00:22:59.581 --> 00:23:00.415
Idiot, he was drunk.

409
00:23:00.415 --> 00:23:02.167
He texted me telling me he missed me.

410
00:23:02.167 --> 00:23:03.126
Come on by my house.

411
00:23:03.126 --> 00:23:06.630
I get there, his other two
girlfriends are already there.


412
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.132
Fool sent us all the same text.

413
00:23:09.132 --> 00:23:10.634
- I'm sure that went over well.

414
00:23:10.634 --> 00:23:12.636
- Like a lead balloon, baby.

415
00:23:16.098 --> 00:23:19.059
Sarah just cried. Karen
wanted to kill him.


416
00:23:19.059 --> 00:23:20.560
So did I.

417
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.603
We probably would have,

418
00:23:21.603 --> 00:23:23.772
but I guess some neighbor
must have heard the commotion


419
00:23:23.772 --> 00:23:24.982
and called the cops.

420
00:23:24.982 --> 00:23:26.525
Next thing we know the cops show up,

421
00:23:26.525 --> 00:23:27.985
they tell us we have a choice.

422
00:23:27.985 --> 00:23:30.320
Either leave or spend the night in jail.

423
00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.155
So we all split.

424
00:23:32.155 --> 00:23:34.741
A couple of weeks
later, he winds up dead.

425
00:23:35.659 --> 00:23:37.619
- Wait a second, you
said that you and Karen


426
00:23:37.619 --> 00:23:38.453
wanted him dead, but
Sarah was just crying.


427
00:23:40.747 --> 00:23:41.623
- Yeah

428
00:23:41.623 --> 00:23:43.250
- But then, didn't you just say

429
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.002
that Sarah also wanted to kill him?

430
00:23:46.295 --> 00:23:47.713
- Look, I don't really know

431
00:23:47.713 --> 00:23:51.091
what anyone else did or wanted to do.

432
00:23:51.091 --> 00:23:53.760
I just know that I didn't do it.

433
00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.138
See, I've got too much to lose.

434
00:23:56.138 --> 00:24:01.143
I've got my bar, I've got nice
customers like Charlie here.


435
00:24:02.144 --> 00:24:05.480
And most importantly, I've got
my son over in Afghanistan.


436
00:24:07.065 --> 00:24:09.026
He's my everything.

437
00:24:09.026 --> 00:24:10.319
I wouldn't do that to him.

438
00:24:12.779 --> 00:24:16.325
- Thank him for his service.
- I'll do that.


439
00:24:19.328 --> 00:24:20.412
What, no change?

440
00:24:20.412 --> 00:24:21.496
- Buy one for Charlie.

441
00:24:23.165 --> 00:24:26.126
- Hey, thanks guy.
- Big spender.


442
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.212
- Okay.
- Okay, what?


443
00:24:31.506 --> 00:24:34.384
- I'm in.
- You read the files?


444
00:24:34.384 --> 00:24:36.928
- Not only that, I went and
met with every one of them.


445
00:24:36.928 --> 00:24:39.097
- Wow, have a seat.

446
00:24:41.224 --> 00:24:42.559
You know, I want you on this,

447
00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:44.561
but I am under a lot of
pressure from the mayor.


448
00:24:44.561 --> 00:24:47.522
I don't need you losing it
and downing a pint of scotch.


449
00:24:49.191 --> 00:24:50.484
- Yeah, that's a fair concern.

450
00:24:50.484 --> 00:24:51.610
But I thought you
said it was the mayor

451
00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:53.320
that asked you to
bring me in on this.

452
00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.447
- Not if you
fail, then it's my call.

453
00:24:57.366 --> 00:24:58.158
- Understood.

454
00:24:59.284 --> 00:25:01.536
Look Diane, I'm done drinking.

455
00:25:01.536 --> 00:25:02.788
I mean, I drank enough
in the last two years


456
00:25:02.788 --> 00:25:03.830
to last me a lifetime.

457
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:07.084
So trust me, everything
will be by the book.


458
00:25:08.585 --> 00:25:10.629
- There will be ground rules.

459
00:25:10.629 --> 00:25:14.132
You will consult with Duke
on all interrogations.


460
00:25:14.132 --> 00:25:17.219
He will listen in and watch
from behind the glass.


461
00:25:17.219 --> 00:25:18.637
- Done, what else?

462
00:25:18.637 --> 00:25:21.390
- I expect to be kept in the
loop on all developments.


463
00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:22.974
I don't have to remind you

464
00:25:22.974 --> 00:25:25.477
that there are circumstances
to these interrogations.


465
00:25:25.477 --> 00:25:28.313
And if I feel even for a second,

466
00:25:28.313 --> 00:25:31.316
that you are taking it
personal, you're gone.


467
00:25:32.234 --> 00:25:33.652
- Diane, you asked
me to do a job.

468
00:25:33.652 --> 00:25:34.986
I'll do the job.

469
00:25:36.905 --> 00:25:40.951
- Last thing I will protect the
integrity of this department


470
00:25:40.951 --> 00:25:42.244
at all costs.

471
00:25:44.329 --> 00:25:45.163
- Understood.

472
00:25:47.165 --> 00:25:49.918
So what's the play?
- You tell me.


473
00:25:52.045 --> 00:25:52.879
- Bring them in.

474
00:25:55.715 --> 00:25:58.385
- This afternoon, the Los
Angeles police department


475
00:25:58.385 --> 00:26:00.303
brought back in the three women

476
00:26:00.303 --> 00:26:04.015
in connection with the
horrific murder of John Davis.


477
00:26:04.015 --> 00:26:07.727
Karen Jones, Cassandra
King and Sarah Dobson,


478
00:26:07.727 --> 00:26:10.355
all former girlfriends of Mr. Davis

479
00:26:10.355 --> 00:26:12.899
are being accused of
either conspiring together


480
00:26:12.899 --> 00:26:14.443
or acting alone.

481
00:26:14.443 --> 00:26:17.070
All three women have
maintained their innocence.


482
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:20.031
John's mother, Francine
Davis was standing by


483
00:26:20.031 --> 00:26:21.867
to talk about today's developments.

484
00:26:22.993 --> 00:26:24.244
- This is the second time

485
00:26:24.244 --> 00:26:26.580
that these same women have been brought in

486
00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.832
and I'm just hoping
it's for something new,


487
00:26:28.832 --> 00:26:30.292
and not just for the cameras.

488
00:26:36.631 --> 00:26:38.175
- You've actually already interviewed.

489
00:26:38.175 --> 00:26:42.095
What do you think?
- Karen's very smart.


490
00:26:42.095 --> 00:26:43.388
I always have the impression

491
00:26:43.388 --> 00:26:44.848
that she's trying to stay

492
00:26:44.848 --> 00:26:47.601
one or two steps ahead
of me in the questioning,


493
00:26:47.601 --> 00:26:50.103
trying to lead me instead
of the other way around.


494
00:26:50.937 --> 00:26:52.856
- Liar?
- Absolutely.


495
00:26:52.856 --> 00:26:56.193
But it's weird, she lies about
stupid, irrelevant stuff.


496
00:26:56.193 --> 00:26:58.695
She said she Hofstra University

497
00:26:58.695 --> 00:27:00.655
yet she went to UC Santa Barbara.

498
00:27:00.655 --> 00:27:01.907
I mean, why would somebody say that

499
00:27:01.907 --> 00:27:04.034
when they know how easy
it is to check out.


500
00:27:05.202 --> 00:27:08.663
- Look, I know
you've been on this case

501
00:27:08.663 --> 00:27:11.666
a lot longer than me, so
I welcome your counsel.


502
00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.586
- And I know Diane told you

503
00:27:14.586 --> 00:27:16.755
I was gonna be her eyes
and ears on this thing,


504
00:27:16.755 --> 00:27:18.089
but I'm a cop first.

505
00:27:20.592 --> 00:27:21.426
- Copy that.

506
00:27:23.803 --> 00:27:28.308
- So 72 hours.
- I have an idea.


507
00:27:32.562 --> 00:27:33.396
- Game on.

508
00:27:42.155 --> 00:27:45.283
- You know, I knew when
you didn't call back


509
00:27:45.283 --> 00:27:46.618
there were something up.

510
00:27:48.078 --> 00:27:49.412
- Mr. Fuller, right?

511
00:27:50.747 --> 00:27:52.082
More like Mr. Fuller of shit.

512
00:27:54.709 --> 00:27:56.878
- Fuller of shit.

513
00:27:56.878 --> 00:27:58.004
That's funny.

514
00:28:00.048 --> 00:28:02.092
Ms. Jones, my real name is Scott Keating

515
00:28:02.092 --> 00:28:04.094
and I'm a detective with the LAPD.

516
00:28:04.094 --> 00:28:05.428
I was brought in two weeks ago

517
00:28:05.428 --> 00:28:08.306
to help with the murder of John Davis.

518
00:28:09.474 --> 00:28:10.725
- Such a waste of time.

519
00:28:10.725 --> 00:28:13.019
I already answered every question.

520
00:28:13.019 --> 00:28:14.187
Don't worry about them.

521
00:28:18.233 --> 00:28:20.402
- It's like I'm dealing
with a straight shooter.


522
00:28:20.402 --> 00:28:21.403
- Glad you think so.

523
00:28:22.612 --> 00:28:26.616
- Look, I already told you, I
don't even know why I'm here.


524
00:28:26.616 --> 00:28:28.952
I told the police everything,
not sure what's changed.


525
00:28:28.952 --> 00:28:32.747
- But what hasn't changed is
that John Davis is still dead


526
00:28:32.747 --> 00:28:34.165
and one of you killed him.

527
00:28:35.584 --> 00:28:38.378
- Really?
- Yes, really.


528
00:28:38.378 --> 00:28:41.464
Throat slashed, body stabbed 17 times.

529
00:28:44.092 --> 00:28:46.261
But maybe a robbery gone bad.

530
00:28:46.261 --> 00:28:48.013
No, you're too smart to think that.

531
00:28:49.139 --> 00:28:50.599
- Well, it wasn't me.

532
00:28:52.809 --> 00:28:53.643
- Really?

533
00:28:57.897 --> 00:28:59.566
Here's how this is gonna play out.

534
00:28:59.566 --> 00:29:00.692
All right, you have two choices.

535
00:29:00.692 --> 00:29:02.986
One, you help me solve this case

536
00:29:02.986 --> 00:29:05.196
by sitting there
answering all my questions


537
00:29:05.196 --> 00:29:06.948
and waiving your right to an attorney

538
00:29:06.948 --> 00:29:09.701
or two, you ask for an attorney

539
00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:14.372
and then this drags on for
months and convinces not only me,


540
00:29:14.372 --> 00:29:16.916
but the district attorney that
you have something to hide,


541
00:29:16.916 --> 00:29:20.462
something that will rain down
such a wave of focus on you


542
00:29:20.462 --> 00:29:23.381
that if you didn't pay a
parking ticket 10 years ago,


543
00:29:24.382 --> 00:29:25.425
we'd know about it.

544
00:29:27.594 --> 00:29:29.262
- Wow, that was direct.

545
00:29:30.263 --> 00:29:32.390
- You want a straight shooter?

546
00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:33.224
If you're innocent,

547
00:29:33.224 --> 00:29:34.934
I would suggest that you sign this letter

548
00:29:34.934 --> 00:29:37.520
waiving your right to an
attorney for 72 hours.


549
00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.148
It's not a legal document,
but if after three days


550
00:29:40.148 --> 00:29:41.691
we haven't charged you with anything,

551
00:29:41.691 --> 00:29:44.402
I don't think we ever will.

552
00:29:44.402 --> 00:29:47.447
But if you're guilty and you
think you can outsmart me,


553
00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:51.159
think the smartest thing
you could do is lawyer up.


554
00:30:01.252 --> 00:30:02.087
- Got a pen?

555
00:30:16.643 --> 00:30:17.894
- I'll be back in five minutes.

556
00:30:17.894 --> 00:30:21.564
You want a water, soda,
coffee, something like that?


557
00:30:21.564 --> 00:30:26.361
- Latte, half-caff.
- Coming up.


558
00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:38.873
- Nice work.

559
00:30:38.873 --> 00:30:41.251
Diane is gonna be happy about this.

560
00:30:41.251 --> 00:30:42.544
- Now the clock is ticking.

561
00:30:44.713 --> 00:30:46.131
- What's in the folder.

562
00:30:47.716 --> 00:30:49.300
- Did you ever meet John's parents?

563
00:30:50.719 --> 00:30:52.178
- No.

564
00:30:52.178 --> 00:30:54.681
I know his father passed
away a couple of years ago.


565
00:30:54.681 --> 00:30:55.890
No, I never met either of them.

566
00:30:58.601 --> 00:31:01.312
- Tell me about your childhood.

567
00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.314
- My childhood?

568
00:31:03.314 --> 00:31:05.275
What's that got to do with anything?

569
00:31:05.275 --> 00:31:06.317
- Do you want
to get out of here?

570
00:31:06.317 --> 00:31:07.193
- Of course.

571
00:31:07.193 --> 00:31:09.863
- Then stop asking questions
and start answering them.


572
00:31:11.281 --> 00:31:12.782
- What would you like to know?

573
00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:14.534
- Father.

574
00:31:16.995 --> 00:31:20.123
- He left my mother when I
was six, never saw him again.


575
00:31:20.123 --> 00:31:22.250
- Sorry to hear about that.
- Don't be.


576
00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:23.752
Treated her like crap.

577
00:31:26.171 --> 00:31:29.632
- Physically.
- Not that I recall.


578
00:31:29.632 --> 00:31:30.467
The yelling.

579
00:31:32.594 --> 00:31:35.430
He would get drunk and blame
her for all our problems.


580
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:36.306
Mostly money.

581
00:31:37.223 --> 00:31:41.561
He went out for cigarettes
one night and never came back.


582
00:31:41.561 --> 00:31:44.981
I heard years later, he died of hepatitis.

583
00:31:47.484 --> 00:31:48.526
- How did your mother deal with him

584
00:31:48.526 --> 00:31:49.569
walking out on the two of you?

585
00:31:49.569 --> 00:31:51.070
- My mother was my champion.

586
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:53.114
She did everything she could for me.

587
00:31:53.114 --> 00:31:54.199
Sacrificed.

588
00:31:55.283 --> 00:31:58.995
- You were married,
but it didn't work out.


589
00:31:58.995 --> 00:32:00.789
Think that had something
to do with your dad?


590
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:02.248
- That man may have been my father,

591
00:32:02.248 --> 00:32:04.000
but don't ever call him my dad.

592
00:32:06.419 --> 00:32:08.922
I was too young to get married.

593
00:32:09.756 --> 00:32:11.966
I stuck it out for eight freaking years.

594
00:32:13.009 --> 00:32:16.262
Truth is I never worked at it.

595
00:32:16.262 --> 00:32:18.264
I chose to focus on my career instead.

596
00:32:18.264 --> 00:32:20.642
I knew what it was
like to grow up poor,

597
00:32:20.642 --> 00:32:24.229
so having to rely on a
man, never gonna happen.


598
00:32:26.648 --> 00:32:28.817
- You still keep
in touch with your ex?

599
00:32:28.817 --> 00:32:30.944
- Not even, please.

600
00:32:30.944 --> 00:32:34.072
He was a douche bag just
like my dad - father.


601
00:32:35.365 --> 00:32:38.034
Look, are we gonna talk
about who killed John?


602
00:32:38.034 --> 00:32:40.286
I told the other detectives
it's gotta be Cassandra.


603
00:32:40.286 --> 00:32:42.413
- Yeah, why?
- Come on.


604
00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.875
The knife that killed
John was military issued.


605
00:32:47.794 --> 00:32:48.670
I looked it up.

606
00:32:49.838 --> 00:32:50.797
Only person I know

607
00:32:50.797 --> 00:32:52.882
who could get her hands
on a weapon like that


608
00:32:52.882 --> 00:32:55.718
is a mother whose
son is a Green Beret.

609
00:32:58.054 --> 00:33:03.059
Okay, if I was gonna kill
John, which I didn't,


610
00:33:04.269 --> 00:33:05.979
I'd just hire a guy.

611
00:33:06.813 --> 00:33:07.772
Less mess.

612
00:33:12.026 --> 00:33:14.571
Anyway, Casandra should be
the one in here, not me.


613
00:33:17.824 --> 00:33:19.158
What are you writing?

614
00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:24.122
- We found Chenille
fibers at the crime scene.


615
00:33:24.122 --> 00:33:25.623
You know anything about that?

616
00:33:25.623 --> 00:33:30.086
- Yeah, it's Chenille and hell
no, I don't wear that crap.


617
00:33:32.338 --> 00:33:36.885
- Guard, please take Ms.
Jones back to her cell


618
00:33:36.885 --> 00:33:38.469
and bring Ms. Dobson.

619
00:33:38.469 --> 00:33:40.597
- Miss Dobson, Sarah Dobson.

620
00:33:40.597 --> 00:33:42.265
What a sweet naive girl.

621
00:33:42.265 --> 00:33:45.560
She loved John and he
treated her like shit.


622
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.562
That girl couldn't hurt
somebody's feelings,


623
00:33:47.562 --> 00:33:48.938
let alone kill a guy.

624
00:33:48.938 --> 00:33:51.065
I'm telling you, it's got to be Cassandra.

625
00:33:54.652 --> 00:33:55.486
- Okay.

626
00:34:01.451 --> 00:34:03.036
You know that file?

627
00:34:04.495 --> 00:34:06.706
That file contains more
information about the three of you


628
00:34:06.706 --> 00:34:08.249
than you know about yourselves.

629
00:34:09.167 --> 00:34:10.376
So when one of my suspects-

630
00:34:10.376 --> 00:34:11.502
- Persons of interest.

631
00:34:11.502 --> 00:34:13.004
- When one of my suspects

632
00:34:13.004 --> 00:34:16.132
who actually grew up in a
middle-class neighborhood,


633
00:34:16.132 --> 00:34:18.635
middle-class family, father
an insurance salesman,


634
00:34:18.635 --> 00:34:22.180
mother, a school teacher,
happily married for 53 years,


635
00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:24.057
you'll excuse me if I'm a bit skeptical

636
00:34:24.057 --> 00:34:27.018
if I'm fed a bunch of
sympathetic bullshit.


637
00:34:28.269 --> 00:34:31.606
- You forget, I dated
a college quarterback.


638
00:34:31.606 --> 00:34:34.192
- UCSB doesn't have a football team.

639
00:34:34.192 --> 00:34:35.985
Something to think about
while you sit in your cell


640
00:34:35.985 --> 00:34:37.070
for a couple hours.

641
00:34:40.323 --> 00:34:41.574
Get her out of here.

642
00:34:41.574 --> 00:34:42.408
- Let's go Jones.

643
00:34:48.915 --> 00:34:50.458
- Are you all right?

644
00:34:50.458 --> 00:34:52.543
You look like you lost your
cool for a second there.


645
00:34:52.543 --> 00:34:54.128
- No, I'm okay.

646
00:34:54.128 --> 00:34:56.881
That's what I wanted her to think.

647
00:34:58.341 --> 00:34:59.884
- Cool, you need anything?

648
00:35:03.096 --> 00:35:04.847
- Let's cut the
lights on the next one.

649
00:35:09.394 --> 00:35:10.228
Don't be scared.

650
00:35:11.604 --> 00:35:12.438
Here we go.

651
00:35:17.151 --> 00:35:18.611
Like I said earlier, if you're innocent,

652
00:35:18.611 --> 00:35:20.488
you have nothing to worry about.

653
00:35:22.115 --> 00:35:27.120
- Karen is the one who
killed John, not me.


654
00:35:27.745 --> 00:35:29.706
- Why would you say that?

655
00:35:29.706 --> 00:35:30.873
- I saw the rage.

656
00:35:32.834 --> 00:35:35.294
- You knew John's mother?

657
00:35:38.256 --> 00:35:40.049
- We never met personally,

658
00:35:40.049 --> 00:35:42.719
but we talked on the
phone a couple of times.


659
00:35:44.554 --> 00:35:46.723
here and there

660
00:35:46.723 --> 00:35:49.058
- We need to interview Francine Davis.

661
00:35:50.184 --> 00:35:53.146
- But you never lent
him any money, did you?


662
00:35:54.397 --> 00:35:57.567
- No, he knew
I didn't have any money.

663
00:35:57.567 --> 00:35:58.943
I mean, I'm a ballet dancer

664
00:35:58.943 --> 00:36:01.320
and my mom's house is in foreclosure.

665
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.365
So anything that I
had, it went to her.

666
00:36:05.992 --> 00:36:06.909
- How'd you meet John?

667
00:36:06.909 --> 00:36:10.204
- Actually, we met the same
way that you and I met,


668
00:36:11.998 --> 00:36:14.667
except he didn't give me a fake name.

669
00:36:16.419 --> 00:36:17.336
- Part of the job.

670
00:36:20.381 --> 00:36:22.925
- He was young
for his age, you know?

671
00:36:24.802 --> 00:36:25.887
But I'll tell you one thing.

672
00:36:25.887 --> 00:36:29.182
He had a temper.

673
00:36:33.603 --> 00:36:36.230
He got this package in the mail

674
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:38.483
and it was filled with dog crap.

675
00:36:39.984 --> 00:36:40.902
(chuckles)

676
00:36:40.902 --> 00:36:43.071
Yeah, dog crap and he lost it.

677
00:36:43.071 --> 00:36:45.865
- Why would someone send them
a package full of dog crap?


678
00:36:45.865 --> 00:36:48.659
- I think he owed somebody money.

679
00:36:48.659 --> 00:36:50.995
- What would make you
come to that conclusion?


680
00:36:50.995 --> 00:36:53.122
- Well, there was a note attached

681
00:36:53.122 --> 00:36:54.457
that said I'm gonna keep giving you shit

682
00:36:54.457 --> 00:36:55.458
until I get my money.

683
00:36:55.458 --> 00:36:56.292
- There it is.

684
00:36:57.293 --> 00:36:59.879
Someone was literally giving him crap.

685
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:04.008
So you were dating
John for about a year

686
00:37:04.008 --> 00:37:06.677
before you found out
he was cheating on you.


687
00:37:08.638 --> 00:37:12.809
- Yeah, I think that's about right, yeah.

688
00:37:12.809 --> 00:37:14.477
- How'd that make you feel?

689
00:37:15.436 --> 00:37:16.562
- How do you
think it made me feel?

690
00:37:16.562 --> 00:37:18.689
I mean, I was mad.

691
00:37:18.689 --> 00:37:20.024
- Hurt?
- Of course.


692
00:37:20.024 --> 00:37:21.067
- Angry.
- Yes.


693
00:37:21.067 --> 00:37:24.403
- Angry enough to kill him.
- No, absolutely not.


694
00:37:24.403 --> 00:37:25.238
I loved him.

695
00:37:25.238 --> 00:37:30.201
- Because in your earlier
interviews with the detectives,


696
00:37:30.576 --> 00:37:33.412
Karen and Cassandra said that
you threatened to kill him


697
00:37:33.412 --> 00:37:34.413
right there in the kitchen.

698
00:37:34.413 --> 00:37:36.124
- Karen and Cassandra a lying.

699
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.210
- You know how many times
my mother used to say to me,


700
00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:41.879
if you do that again, 
I'm gonna kill you?

701
00:37:41.879 --> 00:37:43.422
Hundreds.

702
00:37:43.422 --> 00:37:44.674
Did I really think
she was gonna kill me?

703
00:37:44.674 --> 00:37:45.508
Of course not.

704
00:37:46.509 --> 00:37:47.343
She was angry.

705
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:54.475
So are you sure that
maybe in a fit of rage,


706
00:37:56.477 --> 00:37:58.229
maybe you said something like that?

707
00:38:00.022 --> 00:38:04.569
- And even, if you did say it,
it doesn't make you a killer.


708
00:38:09.115 --> 00:38:09.949
- Maybe.

709
00:38:14.871 --> 00:38:15.663
I was so mad.

710
00:38:23.212 --> 00:38:28.176
But as you said, it doesn't
mean I did it, right?


711
00:38:32.722 --> 00:38:34.348
- State your name for the record.

712
00:38:35.474 --> 00:38:36.767
- Don't think I didn't see you

713
00:38:36.767 --> 00:38:38.519
eyeballing that scotch bottle

714
00:38:38.519 --> 00:38:41.814
before you ordered the
coffee there, Eddie.


715
00:38:43.566 --> 00:38:44.609
Cassandra King.

716
00:38:45.651 --> 00:38:47.111
- Did you murder John Davis?

717
00:38:48.487 --> 00:38:50.114
- No.

718
00:38:50.114 --> 00:38:52.408
Doesn't mean I'm not
dancing a jig on the inside


719
00:38:52.408 --> 00:38:54.493
because somebody else did though.

720
00:38:54.493 --> 00:38:55.912
- Do you know John's parents?

721
00:38:57.205 --> 00:38:59.665
- His dad was dead and he
never talked about his mother.


722
00:38:59.665 --> 00:39:01.417
So, no, I didn't know them.

723
00:39:02.376 --> 00:39:04.170
Do you know what a Birmington knife is?

724
00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:08.049
- I don't know, I'm gonna
guess a knife from Birmington.


725
00:39:08.049 --> 00:39:12.637
A military knife used by
seals and such for combat.


726
00:39:14.388 --> 00:39:18.392
- And your son is currently
serving in Afghanistan.


727
00:39:18.392 --> 00:39:19.352
- He is.

728
00:39:19.352 --> 00:39:21.103
- When was the
last time you saw him?

729
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:25.942
- Last Christmas.
- Did you murder John Davis?


730
00:39:25.942 --> 00:39:27.318
Why don't you ask the ballerina?

731
00:39:27.318 --> 00:39:29.695
- I'm asking you.
- And I already told you, no.


732
00:39:36.744 --> 00:39:37.745
(sighs)

733
00:39:37.745 --> 00:39:38.621
- How's it going?

734
00:39:39.747 --> 00:39:42.375
- Just getting started
with Cassandra King.


735
00:39:42.375 --> 00:39:44.252
- How'd you meet John?

736
00:39:44.252 --> 00:39:46.420
- He was a regular at the bar.

737
00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.924
He used to come in on his way
home from work for nightcap.


738
00:39:49.924 --> 00:39:51.217
One night I was closing up

739
00:39:51.217 --> 00:39:53.719
and he stopped in begging for a drink.

740
00:39:53.719 --> 00:39:54.971
Let's just say he was still there

741
00:39:54.971 --> 00:39:56.681
at the bar with me in the morning.

742
00:39:57.556 --> 00:39:59.809
- How long ago was that?
- Two years ago.


743
00:40:00.893 --> 00:40:02.728
- And your previous interviews
with detective Brown,


744
00:40:02.728 --> 00:40:04.772
you said that John owed
you a lot of money.


745
00:40:04.772 --> 00:40:06.774
- 10,000.
- 10,000.


746
00:40:07.942 --> 00:40:10.278
Did you have that
kind of money on hand?

747
00:40:10.278 --> 00:40:11.696
- I borrowed against my bar.

748
00:40:12.822 --> 00:40:14.323
I've been to your bar.

749
00:40:14.323 --> 00:40:15.491
It's not a smart idea.

750
00:40:17.159 --> 00:40:19.412
I loved him and he needed the money.

751
00:40:19.412 --> 00:40:20.621
Wouldn't you do anything

752
00:40:20.621 --> 00:40:22.123
for the people that you love, Detective.

753
00:40:22.123 --> 00:40:24.125
- Hey! I'm asking the questions.

754
00:40:24.125 --> 00:40:26.377
You do not talk about my family.

755
00:40:27.795 --> 00:40:28.671
- Excuse me.

756
00:40:31.549 --> 00:40:32.550
- Do you understand?

757
00:40:33.718 --> 00:40:34.552
- Yeah.

758
00:40:39.015 --> 00:40:41.976
- John ever pay you back?
- No.


759
00:40:41.976 --> 00:40:42.810
- Nothing.
- No.


760
00:40:45.187 --> 00:40:47.565
- I once loaned
a friend of mine, 2000

761
00:40:47.565 --> 00:40:49.066
and when he didn't pay me back,

762
00:40:49.066 --> 00:40:51.485
I wanted to punch his lights out.

763
00:40:51.485 --> 00:40:54.739
But 10,000, you must
have been going crazy.


764
00:40:56.699 --> 00:40:58.242
- You'd think so, wouldn't you?

765
00:41:06.792 --> 00:41:09.462
- I'll call.
- Call.


766
00:41:11.881 --> 00:41:13.507
(laughing)

767
00:41:13.507 --> 00:41:14.508
- We need to talk.

768
00:41:14.508 --> 00:41:16.927
- Hold on, give me a second,
I'm in the middle of a hand.


769
00:41:16.927 --> 00:41:17.887
- A king and four, you got nothing.

770
00:41:17.887 --> 00:41:19.722
- Oh, what do you doing?

771
00:41:21.307 --> 00:41:22.391
- You like that, huh?

772
00:41:23.976 --> 00:41:26.145
- I guess I'm folding.

773
00:41:26.145 --> 00:41:28.064
Be right back.

774
00:41:28.064 --> 00:41:29.231
- Hell, I'll call.

775
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.027
- Kings and sevens.

776
00:41:33.027 --> 00:41:37.740
- Two pair, seven and sevens.
- Damn it.


777
00:41:40.493 --> 00:41:41.452
- What's the hell is matter with you.

778
00:41:41.452 --> 00:41:42.286
I was gonna win that hand.

779
00:41:42.286 --> 00:41:43.120
- Where the hell is my money?

780
00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.830
- Don't worry, it's coming.

781
00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:45.664
- Bullshit! That's what
you said last week.


782
00:41:45.664 --> 00:41:47.291
- Would you keep your voice down, please.

783
00:41:47.291 --> 00:41:48.459
- What'd you do Johnny?

784
00:41:48.459 --> 00:41:50.294
Did you gamble my money?
- Of course I didn't


785
00:41:50.294 --> 00:41:52.588
as I said, it's invested
in a business venture.


786
00:41:52.588 --> 00:41:54.298
I'm told I'm getting paid soon, double.

787
00:41:54.298 --> 00:41:55.424
- You're full of shit.

788
00:41:57.301 --> 00:41:59.637
You got yourself a cheater in here.

789
00:41:59.637 --> 00:42:01.222
Have a nice game, ass hole.

790
00:42:02.181 --> 00:42:03.974
- He said it
was for a business venture

791
00:42:03.974 --> 00:42:06.102
and I'd get my money back
within a couple of weeks.


792
00:42:06.102 --> 00:42:07.603
Of course that never happened.

793
00:42:08.604 --> 00:42:13.150
- Your son ever meet him?
- Once, he didn't approve.


794
00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:14.193
- Why?

795
00:42:14.193 --> 00:42:16.695
- Because he thought he was using me.

796
00:42:16.695 --> 00:42:18.030
- You ever tell
your son about the money?

797
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:20.491
- Hell no, I didn't tell
him about the money.


798
00:42:20.491 --> 00:42:21.909
- Your son ever
find out about the money?

799
00:42:21.909 --> 00:42:22.743
- Look, I know where
you're going with this.


800
00:42:22.743 --> 00:42:25.746
My son's been in Afghanistan
for the past four months.


801
00:42:25.746 --> 00:42:26.747
- In all your conversations,

802
00:42:26.747 --> 00:42:30.835
you maybe let it slip to
your son about the money?


803
00:42:32.753 --> 00:42:33.587
Careful what you say,

804
00:42:33.587 --> 00:42:34.547
'cause you do not know what I know

805
00:42:34.547 --> 00:42:38.300
and the last thing you
want to do is lie to me.


806
00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.719
- What does he know?
- Nothing I told him.


807
00:42:42.304 --> 00:42:43.389
- You keep me posted.

808
00:42:45.099 --> 00:42:46.559
- I might have mentioned it.

809
00:42:47.435 --> 00:42:51.230
But as I said, my son's
been in Afghanistan.


810
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:53.566
If you think my son had
anything to do with this,


811
00:42:53.566 --> 00:42:54.900
you're wrong.

812
00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:56.735
You're making a big mistake.

813
00:42:56.735 --> 00:42:58.112
I told you it's Sarah.

814
00:42:58.112 --> 00:42:59.822
She killed John.

815
00:42:59.822 --> 00:43:01.615
What'd she tell you her alibi was?

816
00:43:01.615 --> 00:43:02.450
She went to the movies.

817
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:03.492
What did she see?

818
00:43:03.492 --> 00:43:06.704
Kindergarten Cartel, please.

819
00:43:06.704 --> 00:43:08.205
Nobody saw that train wreck.

820
00:43:08.205 --> 00:43:10.458
Some LA blogger said
the person that wrote it


821
00:43:10.458 --> 00:43:11.876
should never be able to write again.

822
00:43:11.876 --> 00:43:13.377
- Taste in movies is subjective.

823
00:43:15.921 --> 00:43:18.757
- Did Sarah tell you that John
made her have an abortion?


824
00:43:22.052 --> 00:43:24.555
She was all excited to
be having John's baby,


825
00:43:24.555 --> 00:43:26.474
but when she told him, he flipped out.

826
00:43:27.308 --> 00:43:29.101
He told her that
he was gonna dump her

827
00:43:29.101 --> 00:43:30.978
if she didn't get rid of it.

828
00:43:30.978 --> 00:43:33.063
Now Sarah says that
they worked through it.


829
00:43:33.063 --> 00:43:34.732
She forgave him.

830
00:43:34.732 --> 00:43:38.152
But come on, how do you
forgive the unforgivable?


831
00:43:39.904 --> 00:43:42.239
- How do you
know so much about Sarah?

832
00:43:42.239 --> 00:43:43.157
- Because that night

833
00:43:43.157 --> 00:43:45.784
after sitting here in this
hell hole for 12 hours,


834
00:43:45.784 --> 00:43:47.703
we all went for a drink.

835
00:43:47.703 --> 00:43:49.747
Sarah likes to talk.

836
00:43:49.747 --> 00:43:51.415
We felt like her therapist.

837
00:43:53.918 --> 00:43:56.712
- Guard.
- What, you don't believe me?


838
00:43:56.712 --> 00:43:59.715
I'm telling you, 
Sarah's the killer.

839
00:43:59.715 --> 00:44:01.342
You're wasting your time with me.

840
00:44:07.139 --> 00:44:08.599
- Jesus, Duke.

841
00:44:08.599 --> 00:44:09.808
You think we missed something?

842
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:15.773
- Now they think my son did it.

843
00:44:16.857 --> 00:44:18.776
- That's ridiculous.

844
00:44:18.776 --> 00:44:20.986
If that's all they got then
we know they got nothing.


845
00:44:20.986 --> 00:44:22.988
just like the last time
they brought us in.


846
00:44:23.989 --> 00:44:25.658
- They didn't even know
about Sarah's abortion.


847
00:44:25.658 --> 00:44:28.577
- Hey.
- Sorry, Sarah.


848
00:44:28.577 --> 00:44:29.870
For all I know, you did do it.

849
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:31.580
- That was out of line.

850
00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.707
- Look, I'm gonna say
whatever I have to say


851
00:44:33.707 --> 00:44:35.000
to clear my name.

852
00:44:36.293 --> 00:44:39.004
- Forget what we all agreed to, huh?

853
00:44:39.004 --> 00:44:41.674
It's like it's everybody for themselves.

854
00:44:41.674 --> 00:44:46.679
And just for the record, John
and I worked through all that.


855
00:44:46.845 --> 00:44:48.681
Okay, so.
- Oh no, you didn't.


856
00:44:50.057 --> 00:44:51.809
Nobody works through that shit.

857
00:44:53.561 --> 00:44:55.354
- Speaking from experience?

858
00:44:56.981 --> 00:44:59.942
- No, just our experience with John.

859
00:45:07.491 --> 00:45:08.617
- Want a glass of wine or something?

860
00:45:08.617 --> 00:45:10.744
Come on, you know I hate drinking alone.

861
00:45:10.744 --> 00:45:12.288
- No honey, I can't.

862
00:45:16.959 --> 00:45:18.919
- You can't, you
mean you don't want to.

863
00:45:20.212 --> 00:45:25.009
- No, mean I actually can't,

864
00:45:27.553 --> 00:45:29.888
not for at least the next eight months.

865
00:45:35.144 --> 00:45:38.939
- Are you telling me what
I think you're telling me?


866
00:45:38.939 --> 00:45:42.443
(laughing)
- I'm pregnant.


867
00:45:43.694 --> 00:45:44.528
We're gonna have a baby.

868
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:47.865
- Alright, hold on, hold on, hold on.

869
00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:51.118
Well, how did this happen?

870
00:45:51.118 --> 00:45:52.036
I thought you were on the pill.

871
00:45:52.036 --> 00:45:54.413
- I know, I am.

872
00:45:54.413 --> 00:45:58.876
I guess we're part of that rare 0.9%.

873
00:45:58.876 --> 00:45:59.960
It's called a happy accident.

874
00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.837
- No, no, no, there's
nothing happy about this.


875
00:46:01.837 --> 00:46:03.255
I'm not ready to be a father.

876
00:46:04.256 --> 00:46:07.718
- I mean, are you ever ready?

877
00:46:07.718 --> 00:46:10.054
Listen, you're gonna be an amazing father.

878
00:46:10.054 --> 00:46:11.472
- Yeah, let me rephrase that.

879
00:46:11.472 --> 00:46:13.057
I don't wanna be a father.

880
00:46:13.057 --> 00:46:15.726
Okay, you can't have this baby.

881
00:46:16.685 --> 00:46:18.437
- What? No.

882
00:46:18.437 --> 00:46:21.273
- Sarah, you can't have this baby.

883
00:46:23.442 --> 00:46:25.110
- I thought you'd be happy.

884
00:46:28.739 --> 00:46:30.658
- You believe in the
right to choose, right?


885
00:46:31.784 --> 00:46:33.619
- Of course.
- Yeah, right.


886
00:46:33.619 --> 00:46:36.205
So do I and I choose for
you not to have this baby.


887
00:46:36.205 --> 00:46:39.375
- I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way.

888
00:46:39.375 --> 00:46:40.542
- What do you mean?

889
00:46:40.542 --> 00:46:42.211
You know what this is bullshit.

890
00:46:42.211 --> 00:46:43.045
- Stop it.

891
00:46:46.757 --> 00:46:48.926
(sobbing)

892
00:47:09.613 --> 00:47:11.657
- Hey.
- Don't touch me.


893
00:47:11.657 --> 00:47:15.327
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell.

894
00:47:15.327 --> 00:47:18.455
Just sit down, we'll talk.

895
00:47:20.916 --> 00:47:21.834
- Stop.
- Okay.


896
00:47:31.051 --> 00:47:36.056
Listen, do you know why
I fell in love with you?


897
00:47:39.184 --> 00:47:44.064
Because you're smart, you're
talented, you're beautiful


898
00:47:46.775 --> 00:47:48.527
and you're the sweetest
person in the world,


899
00:47:48.527 --> 00:47:49.820
everything that I'm not.

900
00:47:52.156 --> 00:47:54.199
- Don't say that.
- No, it's true.


901
00:47:55.242 --> 00:47:58.120
Being around you makes me a better person.

902
00:48:03.459 --> 00:48:04.877
The first night I saw you,

903
00:48:04.877 --> 00:48:06.587
pirouetting on that stage.

904
00:48:08.589 --> 00:48:11.633
I said to myself, I
have to meet this angel.


905
00:48:13.093 --> 00:48:14.428
And not only did it meet you,

906
00:48:14.428 --> 00:48:15.888
but we fell in love with each other.

907
00:48:15.888 --> 00:48:18.766
I mean, how that
happened, I'll never know.


908
00:48:19.892 --> 00:48:22.853
(laughing)

909
00:48:22.853 --> 00:48:25.397
- You can be pretty charming, sometimes.

910
00:48:31.695 --> 00:48:36.658
- Look, the future is
super bright for us, Sara


911
00:48:36.909 --> 00:48:38.994
and I'm telling you soon enough,

912
00:48:38.994 --> 00:48:42.122
we're gonna get married and
we're gonna start a family.


913
00:48:44.875 --> 00:48:46.835
But now is just not the right time.

914
00:48:48.921 --> 00:48:52.174
And I promise you, I promise you

915
00:48:52.174 --> 00:48:54.051
that there's gonna be
plenty of more chances


916
00:48:54.051 --> 00:48:55.344
for us to start a family.

917
00:48:59.681 --> 00:49:04.603
Please, I'm begging you to
do this one thing for me.


918
00:49:06.522 --> 00:49:10.609
I'm just not ready to be a father.

919
00:49:14.905 --> 00:49:16.240
- Why did we even sign
that stupid piece of paper.


920
00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:17.658
Now we're all stuck here.

921
00:49:18.659 --> 00:49:21.620
- Because we're all innocent.

922
00:49:22.996 --> 00:49:24.289
- You know, there was something weird

923
00:49:24.289 --> 00:49:26.333
that happened when I was in there though.

924
00:49:27.334 --> 00:49:28.168
- What?

925
00:49:29.461 --> 00:49:30.754
- I was trying to explain to him

926
00:49:30.754 --> 00:49:32.965
that I would do anything
for the people that I loved.


927
00:49:32.965 --> 00:49:36.468
I asked him if he would, all
of a sudden, he flipped out.


928
00:49:37.845 --> 00:49:40.430
- Are you thinking he's
distracted by something?


929
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:42.099
- That's exactly what I'm saying.

930
00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:45.060
I'm just not sure what it is.

931
00:49:49.022 --> 00:49:51.650
- Excuse me, guard.
- What are you doing?


932
00:49:54.736 --> 00:49:56.738
- I need to make a phone call.

933
00:49:56.738 --> 00:49:57.865
- I'm supposed to let the detectives know

934
00:49:57.865 --> 00:49:59.408
if you plan on calling a lawyer.

935
00:49:59.408 --> 00:50:02.828
- I'm not calling a lawyer,
I'm calling my assistant.


936
00:50:02.828 --> 00:50:04.371
I do own a business.

937
00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.716
Operator, I need to make a collect call.

938
00:50:15.716 --> 00:50:17.467
- I would love to go with you.

939
00:50:17.467 --> 00:50:18.343
Are you kidding me?

940
00:50:18.343 --> 00:50:20.178
Thank you.

941
00:50:20.178 --> 00:50:22.306
Oh my God, can you
hold on for one second.

942
00:50:22.306 --> 00:50:23.765
I just have to hold on, okay.

943
00:50:25.309 --> 00:50:27.394
Joan's advertising.
- Alice, it's me.


944
00:50:28.312 --> 00:50:30.522
- Hey, are you doing okay?
- Stop talking.


945
00:50:30.522 --> 00:50:33.317
- How did you not know this?

946
00:50:33.317 --> 00:50:35.360
- Sara never mentioned.

947
00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.655
- I know, but
why didn't she mention it?

948
00:50:38.655 --> 00:50:42.534
- Easy, your motive to focus on her.

949
00:50:44.077 --> 00:50:45.037
- Maybe.

950
00:50:45.037 --> 00:50:47.664
- Humiliation, embarrassment, regret,

951
00:50:47.664 --> 00:50:49.666
self-loathing, take your pick.

952
00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:53.128
No offense, gentlemen,
but you got a big fat zero


953
00:50:53.128 --> 00:50:56.590
on trying to figure out how a
woman deals with an abortion.


954
00:50:56.590 --> 00:51:01.595
This self-doubt alone
could haunt her for years.


955
00:51:01.637 --> 00:51:04.139
- How long does it take to
get over something like that.


956
00:51:04.139 --> 00:51:07.017
- Okay, just focus on the big picture.

957
00:51:07.017 --> 00:51:09.436
Ask yourself what is the number one cause

958
00:51:09.436 --> 00:51:12.481
for murder investigation
in the last 10 years?


959
00:51:12.481 --> 00:51:13.315
- Money.

960
00:51:14.483 --> 00:51:16.902
- Let me know
when you have any updates.

961
00:51:16.902 --> 00:51:18.195
- Will do.

962
00:51:18.195 --> 00:51:23.200
- Oh, and gentlemen,
you never get over it.


963
00:51:29.915 --> 00:51:31.166
- Okay Duke, let's assess where we are.

964
00:51:31.166 --> 00:51:33.335
All right, what do we know?

965
00:51:33.335 --> 00:51:35.545
I know that somebody
gets their throat slashed


966
00:51:35.545 --> 00:51:36.588
and stabbed 17 times.

967
00:51:36.588 --> 00:51:39.174
Odds are pretty good that
they know their attacker.


968
00:51:39.174 --> 00:51:42.052
However, we have one suspect,
Karen who doesn't care.


969
00:51:42.052 --> 00:51:43.929
Sara, she cares too much

970
00:51:43.929 --> 00:51:45.305
and even though she
said she didn't do it,

971
00:51:45.305 --> 00:51:46.807
Cassandra, she wants to throw a party

972
00:51:46.807 --> 00:51:48.266
now that it happened.

973
00:51:48.266 --> 00:51:50.644
- Now you go a taste of
I've been dealing with.


974
00:51:51.645 --> 00:51:53.021
- Can you do me a favor.

975
00:51:53.981 --> 00:51:55.482
Before you bring Ms. 
Jones back in,

976
00:51:55.482 --> 00:51:57.484
can you give me the transcript
of the interview he did


977
00:51:57.484 --> 00:52:00.320
with Sara Dobson and the
first time you brought her in?


978
00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:03.323
- You got it.
- Yeah, thanks.


979
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:08.203
- Oh man, that is terrible.

980
00:52:13.291 --> 00:52:14.126
Who?

981
00:52:15.502 --> 00:52:16.503
So which one of
you went to the movies

982
00:52:16.503 --> 00:52:17.796
the night John Was killed?

983
00:52:18.755 --> 00:52:19.923
- Hell if I know.

984
00:52:20.882 --> 00:52:22.843
As I said, I was having dinner

985
00:52:22.843 --> 00:52:24.678
at my assistant Alice's house.

986
00:52:24.678 --> 00:52:25.512
- Oh, that's right.

987
00:52:25.512 --> 00:52:26.888
No one else saw you, right?

988
00:52:29.683 --> 00:52:32.602
- When's the last time you
went to the movies, detective?


989
00:52:33.603 --> 00:52:36.857
Actually, when's the last
time you did much of anything?


990
00:52:37.774 --> 00:52:40.027
Word on the street is that
you've been off the job


991
00:52:40.027 --> 00:52:42.112
for the last two years.

992
00:52:45.073 --> 00:52:47.200
- We're not talking about me.

993
00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.535
What are you afraid of, detective?

994
00:52:48.535 --> 00:52:49.536
- I'm not afraid of anything.

995
00:52:49.536 --> 00:52:50.370
- Well, then let me speak.

996
00:52:51.204 --> 00:52:52.205
Who knows, detective?

997
00:52:52.205 --> 00:52:56.752
I might just reveal something
to you and not even know it.


998
00:53:03.717 --> 00:53:08.722
Christmas Eve, 2017,
Molly and Jessica Keating


999
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:11.850
driving down Pacific coast highway

1000
00:53:12.726 --> 00:53:15.604
when a car jumped the median, hit them.

1001
00:53:18.106 --> 00:53:19.441
Both were killed instantly.

1002
00:53:22.277 --> 00:53:25.155
- Don't you talk about
my wife and daughter.


1003
00:53:25.155 --> 00:53:27.991
Apparently the driver of the car swerved

1004
00:53:27.991 --> 00:53:31.411
when some tunnel piping fell
off the truck in front of him.


1005
00:53:31.411 --> 00:53:33.914
He should've swerved right,

1006
00:53:33.914 --> 00:53:36.583
but unfortunately he swerved left.

1007
00:53:36.583 --> 00:53:39.086
- You have no right to talk
about my wife and daughter.


1008
00:53:39.086 --> 00:53:40.253
- Temper, temper, detective.

1009
00:53:40.253 --> 00:53:42.672
You don't want to bias the investigation,

1010
00:53:42.672 --> 00:53:44.007
making it personal.

1011
00:53:45.175 --> 00:53:49.221
But of course, how
could it not be personal


1012
00:53:49.221 --> 00:53:51.139
when the driver's name was John Davis?

1013
00:53:53.475 --> 00:53:54.392
- Oh Jesus.

1014
00:53:56.603 --> 00:53:59.022
- You have and idea
what I've been through.


1015
00:53:59.022 --> 00:54:02.567
- Ruled an accident, my
ex-boyfriend walked free,


1016
00:54:03.527 --> 00:54:05.987
your wife and daughter are dead.

1017
00:54:06.822 --> 00:54:09.491
And yet you sit in
front of me and tell me,


1018
00:54:09.491 --> 00:54:12.244
you can be unbiased?

1019
00:54:13.411 --> 00:54:15.997
- You don't think that when
I heard John Davis was dead,


1020
00:54:15.997 --> 00:54:18.875
part of me felt awesome?

1021
00:54:18.875 --> 00:54:20.377
Wouldn't be human if I didn't.

1022
00:54:21.586 --> 00:54:22.838
But this is my job.

1023
00:54:23.922 --> 00:54:25.549
This is what I do.

1024
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:26.633
I solve murder cases

1025
00:54:26.633 --> 00:54:29.678
and you're not gonna turn
this into a shit show.


1026
00:54:29.678 --> 00:54:30.512
- As far as I'm concerned,

1027
00:54:30.512 --> 00:54:32.681
this whole investigation is a shit show.

1028
00:54:34.141 --> 00:54:36.017
Be honest detective.

1029
00:54:37.185 --> 00:54:39.312
Aren't you glad he's dead?

1030
00:54:41.857 --> 00:54:43.024
- Oh no, don't.

1031
00:54:43.024 --> 00:54:44.317
- Maybe you killed him?

1032
00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:49.573
You say it's personal, detective.

1033
00:54:50.574 --> 00:54:51.658
Personal to whom?

1034
00:54:54.786 --> 00:54:56.788
(screaming)

1035
00:54:56.788 --> 00:54:57.873
- You want personal?

1036
00:54:57.873 --> 00:54:59.541
You really want personal?

1037
00:54:59.541 --> 00:55:02.210
Bring up my wife and daughter
again and I'll kill you.


1038
00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:03.545
- Scott! Stop!

1039
00:55:03.545 --> 00:55:05.005
What are you doing?

1040
00:55:05.005 --> 00:55:05.839
Get her out of here.

1041
00:55:05.839 --> 00:55:06.798
- The man threatened to kill me.

1042
00:55:06.798 --> 00:55:09.050
I don't care what I
signed, I want my lawyer.


1043
00:55:11.636 --> 00:55:12.971
- What happened to my phone call?

1044
00:55:12.971 --> 00:55:14.890
- Why don't you take a
few minutes and calm down.


1045
00:55:14.890 --> 00:55:18.185
- How can you
sit by and be replaced

1046
00:55:18.185 --> 00:55:20.103
by somebody so incompetent?

1047
00:55:21.229 --> 00:55:22.606
Did you see him in there?

1048
00:55:24.149 --> 00:55:25.317
He's falling apart.

1049
00:55:25.317 --> 00:55:27.235
- There's no way to
justify the way he behaved.


1050
00:55:27.235 --> 00:55:28.403
- What happened, Karen?

1051
00:55:29.362 --> 00:55:30.947
- Why don't you give it a break?

1052
00:55:32.365 --> 00:55:34.576
John ever tell you about
the accident he had


1053
00:55:34.576 --> 00:55:36.077
a couple of years ago?

1054
00:55:36.077 --> 00:55:38.413
The one that killed two people.

1055
00:55:38.413 --> 00:55:40.498
- Yeah, he told me.

1056
00:55:40.498 --> 00:55:43.126
- Yeah, the one on Christmas Eve, right?

1057
00:55:43.126 --> 00:55:44.669
- Turns out the victims

1058
00:55:45.795 --> 00:55:48.590
were the detective's wife and daughter.

1059
00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:49.424
- What?
- Yeah.


1060
00:55:50.634 --> 00:55:53.303
- He's the one that's
investigating this case?


1061
00:55:53.303 --> 00:55:56.431
- No, you can
question him all you want.

1062
00:55:56.431 --> 00:55:59.809
This guy's never wrong, ever.

1063
00:55:59.809 --> 00:56:00.852
- Come on, detective.

1064
00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:04.439
You know, we're all innocent.

1065
00:56:05.941 --> 00:56:09.653
- You may not be guilty, but
no one in here is innocent.


1066
00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:18.995
(breathing heavily)

1067
00:56:18.995 --> 00:56:19.829
- Get out!

1068
00:56:33.635 --> 00:56:36.304
Whatever you're thinking
about doing, don't.


1069
00:56:38.014 --> 00:56:39.766
- What am I thinking about doing?

1070
00:56:39.766 --> 00:56:42.978
- If you think about telling
Diane what happened, don't.


1071
00:56:42.978 --> 00:56:44.437
She'll take me off the case.

1072
00:56:44.437 --> 00:56:47.440
Look, I know I screwed up in there.

1073
00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:53.571
- I told you in the very
beginning that I was a cop first.


1074
00:56:56.574 --> 00:56:58.076
Hey man, you blew up.

1075
00:56:58.076 --> 00:56:58.868
It happens.

1076
00:57:01.913 --> 00:57:03.206
But come on, man.

1077
00:57:03.206 --> 00:57:04.624
She baited you good.

1078
00:57:06.626 --> 00:57:07.794
- I guess she did, huh?

1079
00:57:13.717 --> 00:57:15.260
- As long as you're not
drinking on the job,


1080
00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:17.595
which was clearly not
because I would know,


1081
00:57:17.595 --> 00:57:19.055
I have nothing to tell Diane.

1082
00:57:21.057 --> 00:57:21.891
- Thanks, Duke.

1083
00:57:27.022 --> 00:57:28.523
- Who you got coming in next?

1084
00:57:28.523 --> 00:57:30.775
- Got a video conference
with Francine Davis.


1085
00:57:32.193 --> 00:57:35.030
Gotta find out what her
relationship with their son was.


1086
00:57:36.865 --> 00:57:39.117
- I tell you what, why
don't I handle that one?


1087
00:57:40.827 --> 00:57:42.245
- What, in front of Diane?

1088
00:57:42.245 --> 00:57:43.830
- You need to chill.

1089
00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:45.665
Maybe you'll see something watching that

1090
00:57:45.665 --> 00:57:47.584
you wouldn't conducting the interview.

1091
00:57:48.501 --> 00:57:51.463
When we resume with the ladies,
you'll be back in the room.


1092
00:57:54.716 --> 00:57:55.550
- Okay.

1093
00:57:58.636 --> 00:57:59.471
- Good.

1094
00:58:03.350 --> 00:58:05.769
- Ms. Davis, I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.


1095
00:58:05.769 --> 00:58:07.395
It should only take a few minutes.

1096
00:58:07.395 --> 00:58:09.147
- Good call letting Duke take this.

1097
00:58:10.273 --> 00:58:12.442
- Ms. Davis, did you know Karen Jones,

1098
00:58:12.442 --> 00:58:14.986
Cassandra King or Sara Dobson personally?

1099
00:58:15.945 --> 00:58:16.988
- No, I didn't.

1100
00:58:16.988 --> 00:58:19.115
John and I didn't see
each other very often,


1101
00:58:19.115 --> 00:58:21.409
so I never had
the chance to meet them.

1102
00:58:21.409 --> 00:58:23.370
However, I did speak on the phone

1103
00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:25.288
from time to time with Sara.

1104
00:58:25.288 --> 00:58:27.624
- And did any
of them attend the funeral?

1105
00:58:27.624 --> 00:58:30.085
- No, I held
the service here in Florida.

1106
00:58:30.085 --> 00:58:32.128
So none of them attended.

1107
00:58:32.128 --> 00:58:35.382
- How would you characterize
your relationship with John?


1108
00:58:35.382 --> 00:58:37.050
- What do you mean by that?

1109
00:58:38.218 --> 00:58:39.094
- Was it a good relationship?

1110
00:58:39.094 --> 00:58:40.428
Did you get along?

1111
00:58:40.428 --> 00:58:41.805
Did you see each other often?

1112
00:58:41.805 --> 00:58:45.683
- I guess I'd say we got
along pretty normally.


1113
00:58:46.726 --> 00:58:48.103
The last time I saw John,

1114
00:58:48.103 --> 00:58:50.814
was at the reading of my husband's will,

1115
00:58:50.814 --> 00:58:52.273
about two years ago.

1116
00:58:55.985 --> 00:58:57.695
- Sorry, I'm late.

1117
00:58:57.695 --> 00:59:01.074
My secretary is out having a root canal.

1118
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:04.244
- It's nice of you to show up.

1119
00:59:04.244 --> 00:59:05.745
- Don't listen to him, Anthony.

1120
00:59:05.745 --> 00:59:07.747
It's fine.
- Shut up, Francine.


1121
00:59:09.749 --> 00:59:13.294
- Before we get to it, I would
like to say a few things.


1122
00:59:13.294 --> 00:59:15.839
- That's cool, but
can you make a quick.

1123
00:59:15.839 --> 00:59:17.841
- John, please show some respect.

1124
00:59:19.342 --> 00:59:22.637
- I've known Howard now
for almost 30 years.


1125
00:59:24.431 --> 00:59:27.308
I mean he was
the best mentor and friend

1126
00:59:27.308 --> 00:59:30.687
that I could have possibly hoped for.

1127
00:59:30.687 --> 00:59:34.357
When I interviewed to
work here, right here,


1128
00:59:34.357 --> 00:59:36.484
really right out of law school,

1129
00:59:37.318 --> 00:59:40.029
I mean, Howard took me to lunch

1130
00:59:40.029 --> 00:59:43.741
and he made me drink
three martinis with him.


1131
00:59:44.993 --> 00:59:46.828
And then he asked
me if I would do

1132
00:59:46.828 --> 00:59:49.706
a five-minute closing argument

1133
00:59:49.706 --> 00:59:53.626
overturning Plessy versus Ferguson, 1896

1134
00:59:53.626 --> 00:59:58.131
would be known now as Brown
vs. Board of education, 1954.


1135
00:59:58.131 --> 01:00:01.092
I mean I'm half of the
bag and I give it a shot.


1136
01:00:01.092 --> 01:00:03.887
And a week later, 
I get the job.

1137
01:00:04.721 --> 01:00:07.432
And a month later, 
I asked Howard,

1138
01:00:07.432 --> 01:00:11.436
I said, "Howard," I said,
"why did you make me do that?"


1139
01:00:12.312 --> 01:00:15.440
And he says, and I quote, he said,

1140
01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:19.235
"Anthony, I have landed more clients

1141
01:00:19.235 --> 01:00:23.531
"and I have billed more
clients at lunch meetings,


1142
01:00:23.531 --> 01:00:24.532
"drinking martinis."

1143
01:00:25.408 --> 01:00:26.618
(laughing)

1144
01:00:26.618 --> 01:00:28.661
And he said you may or
may not be a good lawyer,


1145
01:00:28.661 --> 01:00:30.246
but if you're gonna work for me

1146
01:00:30.246 --> 01:00:32.832
I've got to know that you're
gonna be at your best,


1147
01:00:32.832 --> 01:00:34.334
no matter how many drinks in.

1148
01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.670
- That was my Howard.

1149
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:39.130
(laughing)

1150
01:00:39.130 --> 01:00:39.964
- Yeah, that's a nice story.

1151
01:00:39.964 --> 01:00:41.674
Now, can we get
on with the, you know.

1152
01:00:41.674 --> 01:00:43.885
- I hope he gave you nothing.

1153
01:00:43.885 --> 01:00:45.470
You can't even mourn correctly.

1154
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:47.597
You are disgrace to his memory.

1155
01:00:47.597 --> 01:00:48.431
- Yeah, whatever.

1156
01:00:50.892 --> 01:00:51.726
- Please continue.
- Sure.


1157
01:00:51.726 --> 01:00:54.229
Maybe we should just get to it.

1158
01:00:56.481 --> 01:00:58.566
- All right, let's take a look.

1159
01:01:02.153 --> 01:01:04.489
To the love of my life, Francine,

1160
01:01:06.658 --> 01:01:11.663
I leave all my assets, the
house, the car, the boat,


1161
01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:13.790
our summer home in Key West.

1162
01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:14.624
- Oh, come on.

1163
01:01:17.126 --> 01:01:20.547
- Now, as far as any financial assets,

1164
01:01:20.547 --> 01:01:22.799
I've set aside $7 million.

1165
01:01:22.799 --> 01:01:27.095
five million to be paid to
my wife, Francine immediately


1166
01:01:27.095 --> 01:01:30.974
and on his 50th birthday,
my son, John Davis


1167
01:01:30.974 --> 01:01:34.269
shall receive the remaining $2 million.

1168
01:01:34.269 --> 01:01:35.270
- Fuck yeah.

1169
01:01:38.189 --> 01:01:40.817
- It is my hope
that by the age of 50,

1170
01:01:40.817 --> 01:01:43.152
John will have found his purpose in life

1171
01:01:43.152 --> 01:01:45.071
and this money will secure his future.

1172
01:01:45.071 --> 01:01:47.240
But I must be clear, he says.

1173
01:01:48.533 --> 01:01:51.869
I just channeled Howard's finger.

1174
01:01:51.869 --> 01:01:52.704
- My Howie.

1175
01:01:54.998 --> 01:01:57.166
- Not one penny shall
be dispersed to my son


1176
01:01:57.166 --> 01:01:58.710
at any time before 50.

1177
01:01:58.710 --> 01:02:02.005
Any financial assets
North of the $7 million


1178
01:02:02.005 --> 01:02:03.756
will go to cover legal expenses

1179
01:02:03.756 --> 01:02:07.468
and the remainder donated to
the Wounded Warrior Project.


1180
01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.054
And that's it.

1181
01:02:11.598 --> 01:02:14.726
- God, if he had
known what type of person

1182
01:02:14.726 --> 01:02:17.895
you'd become he never would
have given you that money.


1183
01:02:17.895 --> 01:02:20.189
- Fuck off Francine, I'm rich.

1184
01:02:20.189 --> 01:02:23.109
Anthony, see you in two years.

1185
01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.114
- Okay.

1186
01:02:29.282 --> 01:02:30.908
- So all in all, you would say

1187
01:02:30.908 --> 01:02:33.411
it was a pretty good relationship.

1188
01:02:33.411 --> 01:02:37.206
- Yes, absolutely.
- Thank you for your help.


1189
01:02:37.206 --> 01:02:40.501
- Please get justice for my son.

1190
01:02:45.506 --> 01:02:47.216
- Good job, Duke.
- Really?


1191
01:02:48.343 --> 01:02:50.720
I don't think we learned anything.

1192
01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:51.554
- Thoughts?

1193
01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:53.765
- And I'm gonna need to see

1194
01:02:53.765 --> 01:02:55.224
the security footage from the theater

1195
01:02:55.224 --> 01:02:58.436
and I need Cassandra
King in for five minutes.


1196
01:03:02.857 --> 01:03:04.942
- Not nice to keep a lady waiting.

1197
01:03:04.942 --> 01:03:05.985
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

1198
01:03:05.985 --> 01:03:06.819
Sorry about that.

1199
01:03:07.862 --> 01:03:09.280
Important call, really had to take it.

1200
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:12.825
- Heard there were a lot
of fireworks earlier.


1201
01:03:14.118 --> 01:03:16.788
- It's a heck of a
coincidence, huh detective.


1202
01:03:16.788 --> 01:03:18.915
- So the night John was killed,

1203
01:03:18.915 --> 01:03:23.795
you were at the bar in the
back office doing paperwork.


1204
01:03:23.795 --> 01:03:26.631
- I was.
- Who was bartending?


1205
01:03:26.631 --> 01:03:27.674
- Milo.

1206
01:03:27.674 --> 01:03:29.717
He's been with me for about four years.

1207
01:03:29.717 --> 01:03:32.178
A great employee, very trustworthy.

1208
01:03:32.178 --> 01:03:34.889
- You fell asleep there,
waking up there in the morning.


1209
01:03:34.889 --> 01:03:38.601
- Look, we've already been
through this like 20 times, yes.


1210
01:03:38.601 --> 01:03:41.479
- And Milo saw
you, but didn't wake up.

1211
01:03:41.479 --> 01:03:43.231
- It happens all the time.

1212
01:03:43.231 --> 01:03:44.774
That's why he's got
his own set of keys.

1213
01:03:44.774 --> 01:03:46.442
He closes up for me.

1214
01:03:46.442 --> 01:03:49.445
- And the camera's in the
bar, in the back office


1215
01:03:49.445 --> 01:03:51.072
they weren't working because?

1216
01:03:51.072 --> 01:03:53.991
- Because they're fake, they never have.

1217
01:03:53.991 --> 01:03:56.536
- How convenient for you?
- Not really.


1218
01:03:56.536 --> 01:03:58.788
If they were working, I wouldn't
be sitting here with you.


1219
01:03:58.788 --> 01:04:02.458
I'd be at home playing with
my dog or working at the bar,


1220
01:04:02.458 --> 01:04:04.085
or you know, living my life.

1221
01:04:04.085 --> 01:04:05.044
- Oh, I love dogs.

1222
01:04:05.044 --> 01:04:08.005
What kind do you have?
- A rescue.


1223
01:04:08.965 --> 01:04:11.300
Pit bull mix, Sheba.

1224
01:04:13.219 --> 01:04:15.638
What kind do you have?
- I don't have a dog.


1225
01:04:18.391 --> 01:04:21.227
It's the night John was killed.

1226
01:04:24.856 --> 01:04:28.651
It's the knife. You never
bought a military grade knife.


1227
01:04:28.651 --> 01:04:33.656
- No.
- Guard, please let him in.


1228
01:04:39.537 --> 01:04:40.371
How are you, sir?

1229
01:04:40.371 --> 01:04:41.497
Thank you for taking
the time to come down.


1230
01:04:41.497 --> 01:04:42.623
- My pleasure.

1231
01:04:42.623 --> 01:04:46.169
- For the record, could
you state your name.


1232
01:04:46.169 --> 01:04:47.712
- Dan Dooley.

1233
01:04:47.712 --> 01:04:49.213
- And what is it you do
for living Mr. Dooley?


1234
01:04:49.213 --> 01:04:51.632
- I run a sporting goods store
in Studio City, California.


1235
01:04:51.632 --> 01:04:52.717
You should stop by sometime.

1236
01:04:52.717 --> 01:04:54.761
We'll give you a discount.
- Okay, fantastic.


1237
01:04:54.761 --> 01:04:56.304
And you guys are doing well.
- Oh, excellent.


1238
01:04:56.304 --> 01:04:58.139
I mean 3 million in sales last year.

1239
01:04:58.139 --> 01:05:00.308
We're about to open up
a new store in Arcadia.


1240
01:05:00.308 --> 01:05:01.642
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.


1241
01:05:01.642 --> 01:05:02.935
- And can you say for the record,

1242
01:05:02.935 --> 01:05:06.063
whether or not you recognize
the woman sitting here today?


1243
01:05:06.063 --> 01:05:07.273
- Absolutely, sure do.

1244
01:05:07.273 --> 01:05:09.192
She came in and bought a
knife a couple of months back.


1245
01:05:09.192 --> 01:05:11.527
- With the store having
that much business,


1246
01:05:11.527 --> 01:05:13.488
how are you certain that
this woman here came in-


1247
01:05:13.488 --> 01:05:15.281
- This is ridiculous, all right.

1248
01:05:15.281 --> 01:05:16.491
- Are you kidding?

1249
01:05:16.491 --> 01:05:18.409
I mean, do you know how many
women that look like her


1250
01:05:18.409 --> 01:05:19.786
come into my store?

1251
01:05:19.786 --> 01:05:21.078
I didn't wait on her personally.

1252
01:05:21.078 --> 01:05:22.371
One of my employees did.

1253
01:05:22.371 --> 01:05:24.165
And of course with those types of knives,

1254
01:05:24.165 --> 01:05:25.917
we have to do
a little bit of checks,

1255
01:05:25.917 --> 01:05:28.920
make sure that not on parole,
probation, that type of thing.


1256
01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:31.297
And so when she came back
in to pick up the knife,


1257
01:05:31.297 --> 01:05:32.131
she had to deal with me

1258
01:05:32.131 --> 01:05:34.342
because she had to sign the paperwork.

1259
01:05:34.342 --> 01:05:35.635
- So you are 100% certain

1260
01:05:35.635 --> 01:05:38.805
that this young lady
brought a knife off him.


1261
01:05:38.805 --> 01:05:41.307
- Oh, absolutely.
- This is ridiculous.


1262
01:05:42.725 --> 01:05:44.477
- Thank you very for coming down, Dan.

1263
01:05:44.477 --> 01:05:46.312
- My pleasure.
- All right.


1264
01:05:46.312 --> 01:05:48.523
- But sir, was that the
only thing I bought?


1265
01:05:49.649 --> 01:05:51.818
- Yeah, I think so.
- Think harder.


1266
01:05:53.402 --> 01:05:55.112
- That's right.

1267
01:05:55.112 --> 01:05:58.783
She bought a lockbox, a
very expensive one, too.


1268
01:05:58.783 --> 01:05:59.659
- That's right.

1269
01:05:59.659 --> 01:06:03.454
I left and I came back and I
asked you about the lockbox


1270
01:06:03.454 --> 01:06:05.873
and I bought the exact
one you recommended.


1271
01:06:05.873 --> 01:06:07.083
- That's right, 
I remember now.

1272
01:06:07.083 --> 01:06:09.377
And let me tell you, beautiful product.

1273
01:06:09.377 --> 01:06:10.878
You should probably get one for yourself.

1274
01:06:10.878 --> 01:06:13.089
- And if you check UPS
International Shipping,


1275
01:06:13.089 --> 01:06:15.341
you'll see that I believe next week,

1276
01:06:15.341 --> 01:06:18.177
I sent it to my son overseas.

1277
01:06:18.177 --> 01:06:20.888
I'm telling you, no matter what you think,

1278
01:06:20.888 --> 01:06:22.849
I didn't kill anyone.

1279
01:06:26.477 --> 01:06:27.353
- Thank you, Dan.

1280
01:06:27.353 --> 01:06:28.187
You can go.

1281
01:06:34.819 --> 01:06:36.237
- Well, it checks out.

1282
01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:40.032
She sent it 10 days later,

1283
01:06:40.032 --> 01:06:45.037
but she sent it. Corporal
Santos signed for the package.


1284
01:06:45.454 --> 01:06:47.206
- Yeah, you know what,
you were right, Duke.


1285
01:06:47.206 --> 01:06:49.959
I now understand your
frustration with this case.


1286
01:06:51.002 --> 01:06:52.545
All my experiences as a detective,

1287
01:06:52.545 --> 01:06:55.756
I know one of them did
it, but like you said,


1288
01:06:55.756 --> 01:06:57.550
this thing is all over the map.

1289
01:06:59.635 --> 01:07:01.429
Any suggestions you have, I'll take.

1290
01:07:05.850 --> 01:07:06.684
- Well, you know,

1291
01:07:07.727 --> 01:07:11.147
we've been focusing on
attacking their credibility,


1292
01:07:11.147 --> 01:07:13.774
asking them a bunch of questions,
trying to trip them up.


1293
01:07:13.774 --> 01:07:17.987
But if you asked me, my
money's on Cassandra King.


1294
01:07:20.364 --> 01:07:21.782
- Yeah, I think I'm with you.

1295
01:07:22.658 --> 01:07:25.536
I mean, Sarah would not
kill somebody like this


1296
01:07:25.536 --> 01:07:26.662
and Karen, she wouldn't do it herself.

1297
01:07:26.662 --> 01:07:27.914
She'd hired somebody.

1298
01:07:27.914 --> 01:07:28.748
- So let's go with that.

1299
01:07:28.748 --> 01:07:29.874
We'll connect the dots.

1300
01:07:29.874 --> 01:07:31.584
Let us squirm until she confesses.

1301
01:07:31.584 --> 01:07:34.295
Look, she had access to the knife,

1302
01:07:34.295 --> 01:07:36.964
he owed her money and she
sure as hell had the hate.


1303
01:07:36.964 --> 01:07:38.132
- Yeah, but the knife was shipped off

1304
01:07:38.132 --> 01:07:39.300
weeks before the murder.

1305
01:07:40.301 --> 01:07:41.844
- Yeah, there's that of course.

1306
01:07:44.305 --> 01:07:45.097
- Detectives.

1307
01:07:47.224 --> 01:07:48.935
- Here's the transcript you asked for.

1308
01:07:48.935 --> 01:07:51.938
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1309
01:07:51.938 --> 01:07:53.522
- Got the Sara Dobson interview?

1310
01:07:53.522 --> 01:07:54.357
- Yeah.

1311
01:07:56.317 --> 01:07:57.652
You know what it gets me though

1312
01:07:57.652 --> 01:08:01.364
is that why she paid
$1,500 for that knife?


1313
01:08:01.364 --> 01:08:03.199
- That's how much they cost?

1314
01:08:03.199 --> 01:08:07.203
- No, because I call five
different sporting goods stores,


1315
01:08:07.203 --> 01:08:10.081
including Dan's to get comparative price.

1316
01:08:10.081 --> 01:08:12.917
So the high end was $549...

1317
01:08:12.917 --> 01:08:16.671
(tense music)

1318
01:08:19.924 --> 01:08:21.676
- The manufacturer had an
option for a custom handle


1319
01:08:21.676 --> 01:08:24.220
that would favor a
left-handed or right-handed.


1320
01:08:25.638 --> 01:08:27.556
That knife cost $1,500.

1321
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:32.103
- Boom.
- What?


1322
01:08:35.356 --> 01:08:37.608
(laughing)

1323
01:08:38.943 --> 01:08:39.777
What?

1324
01:08:41.612 --> 01:08:43.948
- I want to
tell you a little story

1325
01:08:43.948 --> 01:08:47.827
and when I'm done, one
of you is not going home.


1326
01:08:48.828 --> 01:08:50.621
- Is it time to call my lawyer?

1327
01:08:50.621 --> 01:08:53.916
- No, they'll be time a little
bit later, but like I said,


1328
01:08:55.418 --> 01:08:57.628
I'm just gonna tell you a little story.

1329
01:08:57.628 --> 01:08:58.754
- Then get on with it.

1330
01:08:59.839 --> 01:09:00.965
- I first wanna say

1331
01:09:00.965 --> 01:09:02.842
I know that John Davis,

1332
01:09:02.842 --> 01:09:06.429
he was no boy scout,

1333
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:12.435
but nobody deserved to be
killed as savagely as he was.


1334
01:09:14.061 --> 01:09:18.482
Now first Karen Jones,
I want to... Ms. Jones,


1335
01:09:18.482 --> 01:09:19.984
I first want to apologize.

1336
01:09:21.944 --> 01:09:24.864
I said a couple things that I
shouldn't have, and I'm sorry.


1337
01:09:24.864 --> 01:09:27.199
- Apology accepted.

1338
01:09:27.199 --> 01:09:29.118
- Karen, you were married to Michael Jones

1339
01:09:29.118 --> 01:09:31.412
for eight years before divorcing him

1340
01:09:31.412 --> 01:09:32.455
and reading the court papers

1341
01:09:32.455 --> 01:09:36.000
it was a pretty nasty divorce.

1342
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.836
Even at the gall to
ask for spousal support


1343
01:09:38.836 --> 01:09:41.714
after cheating on her with
an ex high school girlfriend.


1344
01:09:43.424 --> 01:09:44.341
- What a dick.

1345
01:09:44.341 --> 01:09:46.469
And I don't believe that someone
who went through all that


1346
01:09:46.469 --> 01:09:49.722
would what savagely kill
someone for cheating on him.


1347
01:09:51.057 --> 01:09:53.601
But I think the
thing that got you was

1348
01:09:53.601 --> 01:09:55.644
was that he got away with it.

1349
01:09:55.644 --> 01:09:57.354
He got one over on you.

1350
01:09:59.565 --> 01:10:02.109
And like you said, you
wanted to kill someone,


1351
01:10:02.109 --> 01:10:02.943
you wouldn't do it yourself.

1352
01:10:02.943 --> 01:10:03.986
You'd hire somebody.

1353
01:10:04.945 --> 01:10:06.947
- Right, so I can go now, yeah?

1354
01:10:06.947 --> 01:10:10.910
- Now Cassandra.
- Bring it.


1355
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:13.287
- You on the other hand
had all the reason.


1356
01:10:13.287 --> 01:10:14.789
Not only was John cheating on you,

1357
01:10:14.789 --> 01:10:17.833
but he also owed you 10 grand.

1358
01:10:17.833 --> 01:10:19.043
And I know you
ain't the kind of woman

1359
01:10:19.043 --> 01:10:21.462
that's gonna get played.
- Damn straight.


1360
01:10:21.462 --> 01:10:24.423
- Now we know the knife that
killed John was military grade


1361
01:10:24.423 --> 01:10:26.300
but we also know the only
knife that we know about


1362
01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:28.427
was shipped over to
Afghanistan three weeks ago.


1363
01:10:28.427 --> 01:10:30.179
So we're sure that that knife

1364
01:10:30.179 --> 01:10:31.555
could not have been the murder weapon.

1365
01:10:31.555 --> 01:10:34.809
- Finally, that's what I've
been telling you all along.


1366
01:10:34.809 --> 01:10:37.353
- But here's the thing.
- What?


1367
01:10:37.353 --> 01:10:39.939
- You didn't buy
that night for your son.

1368
01:10:39.939 --> 01:10:41.273
- What are you talking about?

1369
01:10:41.273 --> 01:10:42.983
- You may have sent it to him,

1370
01:10:44.735 --> 01:10:46.028
but you bought that knife for John.

1371
01:10:52.493 --> 01:10:53.327
Thank you, Duke.

1372
01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:55.788
Hang out.

1373
01:10:55.788 --> 01:10:57.498
- Go on my son's social media

1374
01:10:57.498 --> 01:11:00.209
and you'll see pictures
of that exact knife.


1375
01:11:00.209 --> 01:11:02.795
- You knew John couldn't
buy the knife himself


1376
01:11:02.795 --> 01:11:05.840
with his previous record and
the conditions of his parole,


1377
01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.675
he couldn't buy anything.

1378
01:11:07.675 --> 01:11:11.595
So he gave you $1,500 for a
knife that usually costs 500.


1379
01:11:12.471 --> 01:11:13.931
- Why?

1380
01:11:13.931 --> 01:11:16.142
- I guess because it's
somebody else's money.


1381
01:11:16.142 --> 01:11:19.395
- No, no, no, because he wanted you

1382
01:11:19.395 --> 01:11:22.064
to get a special made grip
for someone left-handed.


1383
01:11:26.443 --> 01:11:28.404
See, Duke just handed of me this photo.

1384
01:11:28.404 --> 01:11:32.158
This is a picture of John,
we got from his home.


1385
01:11:33.409 --> 01:11:34.535
You can take a look closer,

1386
01:11:34.535 --> 01:11:37.121
you can see the driver
head, notice anything?


1387
01:11:37.997 --> 01:11:40.332
- Yeah, John was a lefty golfer.

1388
01:11:40.332 --> 01:11:43.669
- John was left-handed.

1389
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:46.005
Every time he went to sushi,

1390
01:11:46.005 --> 01:11:48.424
he would go into the booth first

1391
01:11:48.424 --> 01:11:50.759
so he wouldn't keep hitting
me with his chop sticks.


1392
01:11:51.594 --> 01:11:52.845
It was really cute.

1393
01:11:52.845 --> 01:11:55.514
- Correct, John was left-handed.

1394
01:11:55.514 --> 01:11:59.143
Now this is something
that Duke just handed me


1395
01:11:59.143 --> 01:12:01.395
from the Department of Defense

1396
01:12:01.395 --> 01:12:04.106
that your son filled out
when he joined the Army.


1397
01:12:04.106 --> 01:12:06.150
Care to guess what it says?

1398
01:12:06.150 --> 01:12:09.069
- That he was right-handed.
- Bingo.


1399
01:12:09.069 --> 01:12:12.489
Now this is where
it gets a little funky.

1400
01:12:12.489 --> 01:12:14.491
You said by your own statement

1401
01:12:14.491 --> 01:12:16.994
that you were leaving the store, stopped,

1402
01:12:16.994 --> 01:12:17.995
decided to keep the knife,

1403
01:12:17.995 --> 01:12:20.456
that's when you went
back and bought the box.


1404
01:12:20.456 --> 01:12:23.792
Yeah, you probably thought
this guy owes me $10,000


1405
01:12:23.792 --> 01:12:26.253
and I'm just gonna hand
them over a $1,500 knife.


1406
01:12:27.129 --> 01:12:27.963
No, no.

1407
01:12:27.963 --> 01:12:31.133
So that's according to Sarah's testimony.

1408
01:12:31.133 --> 01:12:32.593
When you probably came up with the idea

1409
01:12:32.593 --> 01:12:35.971
to fill the box with dog
shit and send it to John.


1410
01:12:37.139 --> 01:12:39.183
(laughing)

1411
01:12:39.183 --> 01:12:40.935
- But you already know,

1412
01:12:40.935 --> 01:12:44.355
I sent that knife to my son
before John was ever killed.


1413
01:12:44.355 --> 01:12:45.189
- That's right.

1414
01:12:46.941 --> 01:12:48.317
You did do that, didn't you?

1415
01:12:50.027 --> 01:12:51.612
- Now, Sarah, you said
you were at the movies


1416
01:12:51.612 --> 01:12:54.031
during the time of John's murder, correct?

1417
01:12:54.031 --> 01:12:55.824
- Yeah, that's correct.

1418
01:12:55.824 --> 01:13:00.829
- This is a security still from
the night John was murdered


1419
01:13:01.705 --> 01:13:04.875
and you can clearly see
Sarah walked into the theater


1420
01:13:04.875 --> 01:13:05.960
with a, with a soda and a popcorn.

1421
01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.378
If you look right
up here in the corner,

1422
01:13:07.378 --> 01:13:11.757
you can see a little timestamp, 8:40.

1423
01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:14.677
Now, you fast forward two hours later

1424
01:13:14.677 --> 01:13:19.223
and you can see the crowd
walking out and there's Sara.


1425
01:13:22.518 --> 01:13:24.561
- Hey, so we're seeing Sara's alibi.

1426
01:13:24.561 --> 01:13:25.646
So we can all go now, right?

1427
01:13:25.646 --> 01:13:27.648
- Well not quite see.

1428
01:13:27.648 --> 01:13:30.776
You see the sweater Sara's wearing.

1429
01:13:36.991 --> 01:13:37.825
- I was wearing a sweater.

1430
01:13:37.825 --> 01:13:39.535
I mean, it's cold in movie theaters.

1431
01:13:39.535 --> 01:13:40.828
Everyone knows that.

1432
01:13:40.828 --> 01:13:42.454
- Yeah, but you see Sara,

1433
01:13:42.454 --> 01:13:46.458
the thing is that we found
these fibers in John's blood


1434
01:13:46.458 --> 01:13:50.796
and is from a very rare material
nowadays called Chanille.


1435
01:13:50.796 --> 01:13:53.465
- My mom got
that sweater as a child

1436
01:13:53.465 --> 01:13:54.550
and she gave it to me.

1437
01:13:56.010 --> 01:13:59.221
And just because there's material,

1438
01:13:59.221 --> 01:14:01.974
that doesn't make me a murderer.

1439
01:14:01.974 --> 01:14:04.226
- No truer words have been said, Sara,

1440
01:14:04.226 --> 01:14:06.478
but you know, it got me thinking.

1441
01:14:07.354 --> 01:14:09.440
In your interview,

1442
01:14:10.774 --> 01:14:13.068
in your interview with Detective Brown,

1443
01:14:13.068 --> 01:14:16.697
you were very specific about
a review of the movie you saw.


1444
01:14:16.697 --> 01:14:18.991
- Kindergarten Cartel, terrible reviews.

1445
01:14:20.117 --> 01:14:21.410
- Yes, they were were horrible.

1446
01:14:21.410 --> 01:14:23.203
Weren't they, Cassandra?

1447
01:14:23.203 --> 01:14:28.167
In fact, you quoted me from
an LA blog reviewer who said,


1448
01:14:31.295 --> 01:14:33.756
whoever came up with that idea

1449
01:14:33.756 --> 01:14:36.675
should be banned from
ever writing movies again.


1450
01:14:37.509 --> 01:14:42.514
Harsh. Yet, here's Sara's
interview with Duke


1451
01:14:42.639 --> 01:14:43.807
three weeks ago.

1452
01:14:43.807 --> 01:14:46.101
Duke: what movie did you see?

1453
01:14:46.101 --> 01:14:48.771
Sara: Kindergarten Cartel.

1454
01:14:48.771 --> 01:14:50.397
Duke: any good?

1455
01:14:50.397 --> 01:14:52.816
Sara: it was beyond bad.

1456
01:14:54.276 --> 01:14:58.155
In fact, whoever came up with that idea

1457
01:14:58.155 --> 01:15:01.533
should be banned from
ever writing movies again.


1458
01:15:01.533 --> 01:15:05.704
Huh, either that's a Mega
Ball type coincidence


1459
01:15:05.704 --> 01:15:10.376
or maybe you didn't
see the movie at all.

1460
01:15:13.212 --> 01:15:16.256
- Well, you clearly see that
I've went to the movies.


1461
01:15:16.256 --> 01:15:19.510
- Sara.
- But I didn't do it.


1462
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:20.344
I swear.

1463
01:15:20.344 --> 01:15:22.554
- Coercing someone into
getting an abortion.


1464
01:15:23.847 --> 01:15:24.890
You were thinking the two of you

1465
01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:26.058
were gonna get married the whole time

1466
01:15:26.058 --> 01:15:29.478
only to find out
he was cheating on you.

1467
01:15:29.478 --> 01:15:31.146
- Damn Sara, you did do it.

1468
01:15:31.146 --> 01:15:35.526
- Our poor innocent Sara
went to the movies at night.


1469
01:15:37.111 --> 01:15:38.404
When the lights went down,

1470
01:15:39.988 --> 01:15:41.323
she snuck out of the back,

1471
01:15:42.366 --> 01:15:47.037
went over to John's house and killed him.

1472
01:15:47.037 --> 01:15:47.871
- No.

1473
01:15:47.871 --> 01:15:49.748
- Security said there
was an unauthorized exit


1474
01:15:49.748 --> 01:15:52.209
from the movie theater at 8:52

1475
01:15:52.209 --> 01:15:54.336
and then another one at 10:24.

1476
01:15:54.336 --> 01:15:55.796
You taped the back door shut

1477
01:15:55.796 --> 01:15:58.632
so that when it closed, it didn't lock.

1478
01:15:58.632 --> 01:15:59.550
- No.

1479
01:15:59.550 --> 01:16:00.384
- Then you drove over to John's.

1480
01:16:00.384 --> 01:16:01.802
- No, no, no, no.

1481
01:16:01.802 --> 01:16:02.970
That is not what happened.

1482
01:16:02.970 --> 01:16:04.763
- The fibers they
found at the crime scene

1483
01:16:04.763 --> 01:16:06.515
match exactly to the sweater

1484
01:16:06.515 --> 01:16:07.850
that you're wearing in this photo

1485
01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:10.394
and forensics even
estimated that the fibers


1486
01:16:10.394 --> 01:16:11.979
are at least 50 years old.

1487
01:16:11.979 --> 01:16:13.272
- And you said
that, that was the sweater

1488
01:16:13.272 --> 01:16:15.566
that your mother wore as a child.

1489
01:16:15.566 --> 01:16:17.109
- No, listen to me, 
I want to speak.

1490
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:24.158
The truth is I have no idea
what happened that night.


1491
01:16:25.284 --> 01:16:27.744
All I know is that
I sat in my seat,

1492
01:16:28.745 --> 01:16:31.081
and then I was woken
up at the end credits.


1493
01:16:32.082 --> 01:16:35.169
I know, I know that sounds crazy

1494
01:16:35.169 --> 01:16:37.004
but that is the truth, okay.

1495
01:16:38.297 --> 01:16:39.965
I didn't leave by way of the exit.

1496
01:16:39.965 --> 01:16:43.927
I didn't tape the door and I
certainly didn't kill John.


1497
01:16:43.927 --> 01:16:45.512
I loved him.

1498
01:16:45.512 --> 01:16:46.847
- Sara, look what you put us through.

1499
01:16:50.767 --> 01:16:51.602
- Wait a second.

1500
01:16:51.602 --> 01:16:52.436
What about the weapon?

1501
01:16:52.436 --> 01:16:55.481
You said that it was a
very uncommon knife, okay.


1502
01:16:55.481 --> 01:16:57.608
How would I get ahold of it?

1503
01:16:57.608 --> 01:16:59.234
How would I kill him with that?

1504
01:16:59.234 --> 01:17:04.239
- We found this two-sided
tape on the ground


1505
01:17:05.407 --> 01:17:06.450
in a spot of water.

1506
01:17:08.035 --> 01:17:10.662
So here's what Sara did.

1507
01:17:12.789 --> 01:17:13.790
You were there when John received

1508
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:15.125
the package Cassandra sent.

1509
01:17:16.210 --> 01:17:18.212
John was so mad that he
kicked you and the box


1510
01:17:18.212 --> 01:17:19.254
outside of his house.

1511
01:17:22.257 --> 01:17:26.970
Took the box home, cleaned
it out, filled it with water,


1512
01:17:28.096 --> 01:17:29.848
put it into the freezer.

1513
01:17:29.848 --> 01:17:33.185
And boom. Hour later, a perfect replica

1514
01:17:34.061 --> 01:17:35.479
of the military grade knife.

1515
01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:39.233
The two-sided tape
wrapped around the handle


1516
01:17:39.233 --> 01:17:40.943
so it wouldn't slip.

1517
01:17:40.943 --> 01:17:42.069
Put in a little cooler

1518
01:17:42.986 --> 01:17:45.864
and then when you left the movie theater,

1519
01:17:45.864 --> 01:17:47.115
you drove over to John's,

1520
01:17:48.450 --> 01:17:52.162
you lured him outside and you killed him.

1521
01:17:58.210 --> 01:17:59.044
Stand up.

1522
01:18:01.129 --> 01:18:02.214
Stand up!

1523
01:18:05.509 --> 01:18:07.469
Sara Dobson, you're under arrest

1524
01:18:07.469 --> 01:18:09.805
for the murder of John Davis.

1525
01:18:09.805 --> 01:18:11.431
You have the right to remain silent.

1526
01:18:11.431 --> 01:18:14.351
Anything you say can and
will be used against you


1527
01:18:14.351 --> 01:18:15.185
in a court of law.

1528
01:18:15.185 --> 01:18:17.062
You have the right to an attorney.

1529
01:18:17.062 --> 01:18:17.896
If you can not afford an attorney-

1530
01:18:17.896 --> 01:18:20.440
- Scott, congratulations, excellent work.

1531
01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:22.901
I never would have come
up that. The ice knife.


1532
01:18:22.901 --> 01:18:23.735
Brilliant.

1533
01:18:25.195 --> 01:18:26.989
- It wasn't just me, it was everybody.

1534
01:18:26.989 --> 01:18:27.823
- No, I can't
tell you what a win

1535
01:18:27.823 --> 01:18:28.740
this is for the department

1536
01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:31.702
and I hope that this means
you'll be back permanently.


1537
01:18:31.702 --> 01:18:33.203
- Well, if Duke handles
the processing papers,


1538
01:18:33.203 --> 01:18:35.289
I'll think about it.
- I'm on it baby.


1539
01:18:36.748 --> 01:18:38.959
- I got to go
set up a press conference.

1540
01:18:38.959 --> 01:18:42.671
You coming?
- Spotlight's more your thing.


1541
01:18:45.799 --> 01:18:47.050
- Great to have you back.

1542
01:18:48.510 --> 01:18:50.137
- After a grueling investigation,

1543
01:18:50.137 --> 01:18:51.888
I'm happy to announce an arrest

1544
01:18:51.888 --> 01:18:54.516
in the connection of the
killing of John Davis.


1545
01:18:54.516 --> 01:18:57.561
And I wanna thank
the DA and her team

1546
01:18:57.561 --> 01:18:59.062
for a job well done.

1547
01:18:59.062 --> 01:19:01.106
Now I'm gonna ask Diane
to say a few words.


1548
01:19:01.106 --> 01:19:02.858
- Thank you, mayor.

1549
01:19:02.858 --> 01:19:06.069
It's been a grind, but this
department couldn't have done it


1550
01:19:06.069 --> 01:19:09.239
without detective Scott
Keating and Duke Brown.


1551
01:19:09.239 --> 01:19:12.159
And with that, are there any questions?

1552
01:19:16.705 --> 01:19:19.291
(mellow music)

1553
01:19:20.584 --> 01:19:23.086
- Excuse me, when you get a
chance, can we have the check?


1554
01:19:23.086 --> 01:19:24.212
- Of course.
- Great.


1555
01:19:26.798 --> 01:19:28.967
- And I'll take this
whenever you're ready.


1556
01:19:30.552 --> 01:19:31.386
- Thank you.

1557
01:19:46.151 --> 01:19:46.985
- Hey.

1558
01:19:47.861 --> 01:19:48.695
(laughing)

1559
01:19:48.695 --> 01:19:50.322
- Hey, small world.

1560
01:19:50.322 --> 01:19:52.991
I forgot you work around here.
- Yeah.


1561
01:19:52.991 --> 01:19:55.118
It's hard to break away during the week,

1562
01:19:55.118 --> 01:19:57.829
but I like to get over here
in the weekends, if I can.


1563
01:20:00.582 --> 01:20:05.212
So I heard Sara's attorney
and the prosecution


1564
01:20:05.212 --> 01:20:08.006
made a plea deal.
- Yeah, 12 years.


1565
01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:12.010
- How do you feel about that?

1566
01:20:12.010 --> 01:20:12.928
- It's not my job to feel.

1567
01:20:12.928 --> 01:20:15.222
It's my job to get to the truth.

1568
01:20:15.222 --> 01:20:16.431
But if you're asking as a civilian,

1569
01:20:16.431 --> 01:20:18.725
I think she made the right choice.

1570
01:20:19.851 --> 01:20:23.647
Minimum 25 if she lost at
trial, that's too much to risk.


1571
01:20:23.647 --> 01:20:26.441
- Yeah, I get that.

1572
01:20:27.943 --> 01:20:31.947
Please tell the DA, apology accepted.

1573
01:20:32.948 --> 01:20:35.575
- I will.
You want anything?


1574
01:20:35.575 --> 01:20:37.077
I haven't paid yet.

1575
01:20:37.077 --> 01:20:38.662
- Oh no, I'm
gonna grab something to go.

1576
01:20:38.662 --> 01:20:40.414
I've got a weekend
meeting with an attorney


1577
01:20:40.414 --> 01:20:42.165
who wants to advertise.

1578
01:20:42.165 --> 01:20:44.835
Ironic, huh?
- I'm sure you'll do great.


1579
01:20:47.921 --> 01:20:49.297
- Hey listen, I want to say,

1580
01:20:49.297 --> 01:20:54.136
I really am sorry about what
happened to your family.


1581
01:20:57.973 --> 01:20:59.182
- You know what
again, in a weird way,

1582
01:20:59.182 --> 01:21:01.101
it's kind of good for me.

1583
01:21:01.977 --> 01:21:02.811
- How so?

1584
01:21:04.104 --> 01:21:04.938
- Well, you know, I've been
running for the past two years


1585
01:21:04.938 --> 01:21:07.023
and this case made me stop

1586
01:21:08.066 --> 01:21:09.484
had to finish the grieving process.

1587
01:21:09.484 --> 01:21:12.779
And if it took finding
the killer of the guy


1588
01:21:12.779 --> 01:21:17.075
who took my family, then
you know what, even better.


1589
01:21:20.078 --> 01:21:22.372
- Mind if I run something by you?

1590
01:21:23.457 --> 01:21:24.291
- Shoot.

1591
01:21:26.084 --> 01:21:28.837
- Look, I know all the
evidence points to Sara,


1592
01:21:30.255 --> 01:21:31.840
but what if she's telling the truth?

1593
01:21:32.883 --> 01:21:37.888
- Guilty people lie all the
time, believe me, she's guilty.


1594
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:39.431
- What if she's not?

1595
01:21:40.891 --> 01:21:44.561
- Look, Sara arrives at the
theater for an 8:45 movie.


1596
01:21:44.561 --> 01:21:46.646
Now she says she doesn't remember anything

1597
01:21:46.646 --> 01:21:49.608
from the time she got
there til the end credits.


1598
01:21:49.608 --> 01:21:50.567
- Correct.
- Okay.


1599
01:21:51.985 --> 01:21:55.906
What if somebody drugged her?
- Drugged her?


1600
01:21:55.906 --> 01:21:57.699
So now we're bringing in drugs, huh?

1601
01:21:57.699 --> 01:22:00.744
- People get distracted at
movie theaters all the time.


1602
01:22:00.744 --> 01:22:03.622
All it takes is waiting
for the right moment.


1603
01:22:04.498 --> 01:22:05.582
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.


1604
01:22:05.582 --> 01:22:07.375
- I'm having trouble
taking off my backpack.


1605
01:22:07.375 --> 01:22:09.169
Can you help me?
- Yeah, of course.


1606
01:22:09.169 --> 01:22:12.839
It would be so easy for
someone to just lean over


1607
01:22:12.839 --> 01:22:15.509
and put a little something in her drink.

1608
01:22:15.509 --> 01:22:16.343
- Of course.

1609
01:22:18.929 --> 01:22:20.472
There you go.
- Thank you.


1610
01:22:20.472 --> 01:22:22.057
- Enjoy the movie.
- You too.


1611
01:22:27.562 --> 01:22:30.649
- Two to three minutes later,
she was out like the light.


1612
01:22:35.028 --> 01:22:38.281
A person then grabs some
fibers from Sara's sweater


1613
01:22:38.281 --> 01:22:40.325
and heads over to the exit,

1614
01:22:40.325 --> 01:22:43.578
making sure to put a little
tape on the exit to get back in.


1615
01:22:44.412 --> 01:22:45.956
That person is then picked up

1616
01:22:45.956 --> 01:22:49.209
and the two drive to John's house.

1617
01:22:49.209 --> 01:22:51.294
- How'd it go?
- Perfect.


1618
01:22:51.294 --> 01:22:52.921
We've got 74 minutes, let's roll.

1619
01:22:54.589 --> 01:22:56.007
- After they get to John's house,

1620
01:22:56.007 --> 01:22:58.802
one of them takes him outside to distract

1621
01:22:58.802 --> 01:23:00.262
while the other gets ready.

1622
01:23:02.305 --> 01:23:05.517
When the time is right, they strike.

1623
01:23:05.517 --> 01:23:06.768
- Remember me?

1624
01:23:18.738 --> 01:23:20.156
- After John is dead,
they leave a few fibers


1625
01:23:20.156 --> 01:23:23.034
from a rare sweater in a
pool of blood on the ground,


1626
01:23:25.662 --> 01:23:28.206
leaving the murder weapon to melt away,

1627
01:23:28.206 --> 01:23:30.584
but making sure the tape was found.

1628
01:23:39.384 --> 01:23:41.761
10 minutes later, the movie ends.

1629
01:23:43.096 --> 01:23:45.098
- That was a lousy movie.

1630
01:23:45.098 --> 01:23:46.892
- Excuse me lady, are you okay?

1631
01:23:49.352 --> 01:23:50.186
- Yeah.

1632
01:23:51.813 --> 01:23:54.065
- So what do you think?

1633
01:23:55.942 --> 01:23:57.444
Could that be possible

1634
01:23:57.444 --> 01:23:59.446
or just one of my wacky theories?

1635
01:24:01.364 --> 01:24:04.910
- Hey, how you doing Eddie?

1636
01:24:06.828 --> 01:24:09.080
(chuckles)

1637
01:24:10.498 --> 01:24:11.583
What, no hello?

1638
01:24:13.335 --> 01:24:15.629
- I just ran
my theory by the detective

1639
01:24:15.629 --> 01:24:19.132
about Sara being innocent
of John's murder.


1640
01:24:20.717 --> 01:24:22.344
I think he's still taking it in.

1641
01:24:24.763 --> 01:24:28.183
- I thought it was crazy when
she told me too detective.


1642
01:24:28.183 --> 01:24:29.351
Crazy possible.

1643
01:24:30.352 --> 01:24:33.021
- So you just basically
killed a man for nothing


1644
01:24:34.230 --> 01:24:35.941
and Sara's gonna rot in
jail for the next 12 years


1645
01:24:35.941 --> 01:24:39.319
for a crime she didn't
commit because he cheated,


1646
01:24:39.319 --> 01:24:40.153
because he owed you money?

1647
01:24:40.153 --> 01:24:41.196
He was broke, so what?

1648
01:24:42.489 --> 01:24:44.324
- Are you sure about that, detective?

1649
01:24:47.369 --> 01:24:48.370
- What the hell is going on?

1650
01:24:48.370 --> 01:24:49.996
- I may have shared his last name,

1651
01:24:49.996 --> 01:24:52.874
but John was never my real son,

1652
01:24:52.874 --> 01:24:56.169
but you knew that, right detective
or did you miss that too?


1653
01:24:57.003 --> 01:24:59.214
When my husband died two years ago,

1654
01:24:59.214 --> 01:25:01.925
I wasn't aware that he had set
up a trust fund for his son


1655
01:25:01.925 --> 01:25:04.844
for when he turned 50. $2 million!

1656
01:25:06.846 --> 01:25:09.099
How unfortunate that he didn't make it.

1657
01:25:10.308 --> 01:25:12.769
- Let me guess, you got the money.

1658
01:25:13.603 --> 01:25:17.065
John has been nothing but
a loser his entire life.


1659
01:25:17.065 --> 01:25:19.776
And Sara called me crying
and told me about the night


1660
01:25:19.776 --> 01:25:21.695
they all found out about his cheating,

1661
01:25:21.695 --> 01:25:24.364
I decided to reach out to these two,

1662
01:25:24.364 --> 01:25:26.616
get a feel so to speak.

1663
01:25:26.616 --> 01:25:30.870
It didn't take much, but look
at the bright side, detective.


1664
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:35.333
Sarah may be an innocent
woman doing some hard time,


1665
01:25:35.333 --> 01:25:37.043
but I made sure that her mother

1666
01:25:37.043 --> 01:25:40.088
doesn't have to worry about
that pesky foreclosure anymore.


1667
01:25:42.048 --> 01:25:45.885
- Francine's extra 500,000
reasons for each of us


1668
01:25:45.885 --> 01:25:48.471
wouldn't make it hard to decide.

1669
01:25:49.639 --> 01:25:52.350
- Are you three confessing right now?

1670
01:25:53.518 --> 01:25:56.730
- Come on, detective,
like Francine would pay us


1671
01:25:56.730 --> 01:25:59.607
half a million dollars
each to kill her stepson.


1672
01:26:01.026 --> 01:26:02.777
- Hell I would
have done it for 10.

1673
01:26:04.487 --> 01:26:06.698
- I just wanna say thank you, detective.

1674
01:26:07.532 --> 01:26:10.452
The city is so much safer
today because of you.


1675
01:26:17.208 --> 01:26:18.334
- So much safer.

1676
01:26:22.047 --> 01:26:23.131
- Absolutely.

1677
01:26:29.637 --> 01:26:31.890
- I won't let
you get away with this.

1678
01:26:31.890 --> 01:26:33.600
- How long away?

1679
01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:34.768
Two years away?

1680
01:26:35.685 --> 01:26:37.604
You got overconfident.

1681
01:26:37.604 --> 01:26:39.397
I know how the justice department works.

1682
01:26:39.397 --> 01:26:41.274
47 wins and no losses,

1683
01:26:41.274 --> 01:26:43.401
how many of those people
were in innocent too?


1684
01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.696
Yeah, when I found out

1685
01:26:46.696 --> 01:26:48.198
that John killed your wife and daughter,

1686
01:26:48.198 --> 01:26:51.618
it didn't take much for you
to make it personal, did it?


1687
01:26:52.869 --> 01:26:56.831
And in the process, you
lost track of the truth


1688
01:26:56.831 --> 01:27:00.460
and Sara lost everything.

1689
01:27:02.045 --> 01:27:04.589
Chew on that for the next 12 years.

1690
01:27:13.723 --> 01:27:16.768
(phone ringing)

1691
01:27:16.768 --> 01:27:19.604
- Brown.
- They played me Duke.


1692
01:27:21.147 --> 01:27:23.024
- Where have you been?

1693
01:27:23.024 --> 01:27:25.318
I've called and text you
for the past three days.


1694
01:27:25.318 --> 01:27:27.362
- Duke, damn it,
the look on their faces.

1695
01:27:28.363 --> 01:27:29.197
- Are you drunk?

1696
01:27:31.116 --> 01:27:35.036
- Sara Dobson didn't kill John Davis.

1697
01:27:35.036 --> 01:27:36.871
- Where's this coming from?

1698
01:27:36.871 --> 01:27:39.124
- You got to get
Diane to reopen the case.

1699
01:27:39.124 --> 01:27:41.334
- It's not gonna happen, Scott.

1700
01:27:41.334 --> 01:27:43.419
The investigation is closed.

1701
01:27:43.419 --> 01:27:45.046
She pled guilty, end of story.

1702
01:27:45.046 --> 01:27:46.506
- No, no.

1703
01:27:46.506 --> 01:27:48.258
I have to let her know that
I know that she's innocent.


1704
01:27:48.258 --> 01:27:50.802
- All she'll see is the
man who destroyed her life.


1705
01:27:53.513 --> 01:27:54.347
Scott.

1706
01:28:00.728 --> 01:28:04.315
- [Officer] Inmate Dobson,
you have a visitor.


1707
01:28:19.038 --> 01:28:23.168
- Wow, I never
thought I'd see you again.

1708
01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.214
Did you come here to gloat?

1709
01:28:30.341 --> 01:28:33.178
I can't even believe you at
the nerve to show up here.


1710
01:28:37.015 --> 01:28:39.058
You ruined my life.

1711
01:28:41.102 --> 01:28:43.146
You ruined my life!

1712
01:28:45.064 --> 01:28:45.899
Look at me.

1713
01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:49.652
For the next 12 years,

1714
01:28:51.196 --> 01:28:55.074
I want you to know that you put
an innocent woman in prison.


1715
01:28:57.827 --> 01:28:59.913
Now I know that
you may not believe that,

1716
01:29:02.916 --> 01:29:04.876
but that is my truth

1717
01:29:04.876 --> 01:29:07.170
and that is the only
thing that matters to me.


1718
01:29:13.718 --> 01:29:14.552
What?

1719
01:29:21.142 --> 01:29:23.061
You got nothing to say?

1720
01:29:26.606 --> 01:29:29.776
You're just gonna sit there and stare?

1721
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:49.504
♪ Given me love given me peace ♪

1722
01:29:49.504 --> 01:29:52.548
