1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.944
got popcorn??

2
00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:57.585
Well, then... Urrmm, now.

3
00:01:58.386 --> 00:02:00.419
I'll begin at the beginnin'.

4
00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.623
A fine, soft day
in the spring it was

5
00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:07.662
when the train pulled into Castletown,
three hours late as usual,


6
00:02:07.963 --> 00:02:10.033
and himself got out.

7
00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:14.137
He didn't have the look
of an American tourist at'all about him,


8
00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:18.343
not a camera on him and, what was worse,
not even a fishing-rod!


9
00:02:20.012 --> 00:02:21.948
Castletown?

10
00:02:28.554 --> 00:02:31.993
- Castletown?
- Could you tell me the way to Inisfree?


11
00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:35.899
Inisfree? Aw, five miles
and maybe a half more.

12
00:02:36.131 --> 00:02:38.200
- Do you see that road over there?
- Yeah.


13
00:02:38.401 --> 00:02:43.041
Don't take that one, it'll do you no good.
Now, the best road to Inisfree, and many...


14
00:02:43.241 --> 00:02:47.948
Oh, Inisfree you want. Be savin' your breath, Mr. Maloney,
let me direct the gentleman.


15
00:02:48.145 --> 00:02:49.647
Happen to know the way to Knoghenor?

16
00:02:49.847 --> 00:02:53.753
If he knew the way to Knoghenor,
would he be asking the way to Inisfree? It's just beyond..


17
00:02:53.953 --> 00:02:56.490
There's many knows Knoghenor
that doesn't know Inisfree.


18
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.962
If you'd take the time to study
your country's history, Mr Maloney...


19
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:04.066
- ... you'd be the first to admit it.
- Don't send the poor man there.


20
00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:08.473
The fishing is finished there entirely.
Tell me, Yank, what is it that you're after?


21
00:03:08.673 --> 00:03:12.275
- Is it trout or salmon?
- All I want is to get to Inisfree.


22
00:03:12.476 --> 00:03:15.613
Ah, now you're talking sense.
The best fishing in the country.


23
00:03:15.813 --> 00:03:19.319
- True.
- Trout as long as your arm.


24
00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.125
And salmon! The last one I got,
I expected Jonah to pop out of his mouth.


25
00:03:24.325 --> 00:03:26.995
Ah, Inisfree. I'd bring you there myself,

26
00:03:27.195 --> 00:03:29.165
only I got to drive the train.

27
00:03:29.365 --> 00:03:33.270
Hey, was I tellin' you about that trout
I got two summers before last?


28
00:03:33.471 --> 00:03:36.139
- At Inisfree?
- Not at all! Not at all!


29
00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:38.409
At Ballygar, over the
other end of the country.

30
00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.249
My sister's third young
one is living at Inisfree,

31
00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:47.054
and she'd be only too happy
to show you the road.


32
00:03:47.254 --> 00:03:51.292
- No, no, if she was here.
- It's Inisfree the man wants to go to.


33
00:03:51.492 --> 00:03:55.832
- You see that signpost over there?
- What do you know...


34
00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:13.119
Inisfree, this way.

35
00:04:37.416 --> 00:04:41.722
I wonder, now, why a
man would go to Inisfree?.

36
00:05:06.186 --> 00:05:09.892
- Six  six?
- Four and a half.


37
00:05:27.612 --> 00:05:31.051
- Cin cin nati?
- Nope, Pittsburgh.


38
00:05:31.251 --> 00:05:33.421
Pi..Pitss...

39
00:05:50.107 --> 00:05:53.879
Don't you remember, 
Seaneen, and how it was.

40
00:05:54.948 --> 00:05:59.755
The road led up past the chapel,
and it wound, and it wound,


41
00:05:59.955 --> 00:06:04.324
and there was the field where
Dan Tobin's bull chased you.


42
00:06:04.558 --> 00:06:09.732
It was a lovely little house, Seaneen,
and the roses.!


43
00:06:09.932 --> 00:06:15.706
Your father used to tease me about them,
but he was that proud of them, too.


44
00:06:18.243 --> 00:06:22.015
Ah,That's nothin' but a..., wee humble cottage.

45
00:06:39.402 --> 00:06:43.608
That little place across the brook,
that humble cottage. Who owns it now?


46
00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:46.312
The widow Tillane.
Not that she lives there.


47
00:06:46.512 --> 00:06:48.712
- You think she'd sell it?
- I doubt it.


48
00:06:48.913 --> 00:06:51.616
Don't bet on it, 'cause I'm buyin' it.

49
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.256
Now, Why... why would a Yankee from Pittsburgh
want to buy it?


50
00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.528
I'll tell you why, Michaleen Oge Flynn,
young small Michael Flynn,


51
00:07:00.728 --> 00:07:03.099
who used to wipe my runny nose
when I was kid.


52
00:07:03.332 --> 00:07:07.672
Because I'm Sean Thornton,
and I was born in that little cottage over there.


53
00:07:08.706 --> 00:07:12.045
And I've come home,
and home I'm gonna stay.

54
00:07:12.243 --> 00:07:16.314
Does that answer your questions
once and for all, you nosy little man?


55
00:07:16.515 --> 00:07:20.787
Seaneen Thornton... The...

56
00:07:21.655 --> 00:07:23.324
And look at you now.

57
00:07:23.525 --> 00:07:26.762
What do they feed you,
all you men who are in Pittsburgh?


58
00:07:26.962 --> 00:07:33.036
Steel,Michal-o, steel and pig-iron
furnaces so hot a man forgets his
fear of hell.


59
00:07:33.238 --> 00:07:37.774
When you're hard enough,
tough enough... other things.


60
00:07:39.843 --> 00:07:42.247
Other things, Michaleen.

61
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:04.475
Now then, here comes myself,
that's me there, walking.


62
00:08:04.675 --> 00:08:11.217
That tall, saintly-looking man.
Peter Lonergan, parish priest.


63
00:08:11.418 --> 00:08:14.988
Good day, Father. 
Sean, this is Father Lonergan.

64
00:08:16.357 --> 00:08:20.029
Father, would you believe it?
This is Sean Thornton,


65
00:08:20.262 --> 00:08:23.434
born right here in Inisfree, home from America.

66
00:08:23.668 --> 00:08:26.569
- Hello, Father.
- Ah, yes.


67
00:08:27.169 --> 00:08:29.372
I knew your people, Sean.

68
00:08:29.573 --> 00:08:35.715
Your grandfather...
He died in Australia, in a penal colony.


69
00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:39.352
And your father, he
was a good man too.

70
00:08:39.586 --> 00:08:43.091
Bad accident, that. 
And your mother?

71
00:08:43.291 --> 00:08:46.262
She's dead. America, when I was twelve.

72
00:08:47.096 --> 00:08:52.368
I'll remember her in the mass tomorrow.
You'll be there, seven o'clock.


73
00:08:52.568 --> 00:08:54.470
- Sure, I will.
- Good.


74
00:08:54.705 --> 00:08:57.776
Sean, I'd like to have a little word
with Michaleen here.


75
00:08:57.976 --> 00:09:00.612
- Sure thing, Father.
- It'll only take a minute.


76
00:09:00.812 --> 00:09:04.017
- It's a little matter...
- Take your time. I'll be up ahead.


77
00:10:07.429 --> 00:10:09.632
(MICHALEEN): Sean!

78
00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:21.614
Hey, is that real?. 
She couldn't be...

79
00:10:21.815 --> 00:10:27.286
Uh, nonsense, man. It's only a mirage
brought on by your terrible thirst.


80
00:10:27.486 --> 00:10:30.223
Come up, Napoleon.

81
00:11:24.526 --> 00:11:27.796
Over here we pronounce it "Co-han".

82
00:12:38.084 --> 00:12:39.585
Good morning.

83
00:13:00.545 --> 00:13:05.985
None of that now, None of that!
It's a bold, sinful man you are, Sean Thornton!


84
00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:09.791
Who taught you to be playing patty fingers
in the Holy Water?


85
00:13:10.024 --> 00:13:12.194
- Just being polite, that's all.
- What is this?


86
00:13:12.428 --> 00:13:15.362
Maybe you don't know
it's a privilege reserved for courting couples,


87
00:13:15.562 --> 00:13:17.999
and then, only when
the banns have been read.

88
00:13:18.199 --> 00:13:22.973
And Mary Kate Danaher
dippin' her fingers in just as neat as you please.


89
00:13:23.173 --> 00:13:27.612
- What did you say her name was?
- Mary Kate Danaher.


90
00:13:27.812 --> 00:13:29.882
And don't be getting
any notions in your head.

91
00:13:30.082 --> 00:13:33.654
- Mary Kate...
- Forget it, Sean, forget it.


92
00:13:33.854 --> 00:13:36.657
- Put it out of your mind entirely.
- Why? What's the matter?


93
00:13:36.857 --> 00:13:39.993
- She isn't married or anything?
- Married? That one?


94
00:13:40.227 --> 00:13:43.498
Not likely. And her
with her freckles and her temper.


95
00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:47.303
Oh, that red head
of hers is no lie.

96
00:13:47.504 --> 00:13:51.141
Still, a man might put up with that;
but not with her lack of a fortune.


97
00:14:03.222 --> 00:14:07.261
The wealthiest woman in Inisfree
was the widow Tillane.


98
00:14:07.462 --> 00:14:09.898
She had neither chick nor child, poor soul,

99
00:14:10.098 --> 00:14:13.937
but she was well-respected
and good to the poor.


100
00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:17.675
- So you were born there, is that it?
- Yes, ma'am.


101
00:14:17.875 --> 00:14:21.079
All the Thorntons were born there,
seven generations.


102
00:14:21.314 --> 00:14:24.750
I see. And what
is your thought, Mr Thornton,

103
00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:29.021
are you planning to turn
White O' Mornin' into a national shrine?


104
00:14:29.222 --> 00:14:32.593
Perhaps charge tuppence a visit
for a guided tour


105
00:14:32.793 --> 00:14:38.067
through the little cottage where the Thorntons
were born. Are you a man of such eminence?


106
00:14:38.267 --> 00:14:40.002
No, not exactly.

107
00:14:40.237 --> 00:14:46.111
My own family, Mr. Thornton, has been in Ireland since
the Normans came some hundreds of years ago,


108
00:14:46.311 --> 00:14:50.982
but we've seen no reason to establish
monuments or memorials...


109
00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:55.321
Look, Mrs Tillane, I'm not talking about
memorials or monuments.


110
00:14:55.522 --> 00:15:00.495
Ever since I was a kid
living in a shack near the slag heaps,


111
00:15:00.695 --> 00:15:04.834
my mother has told me about
Inisfree and White O' Mornin'.


112
00:15:05.034 --> 00:15:09.307
Inisfree has become
another word for heaven to me.


113
00:15:09.507 --> 00:15:14.211
When I quit the... When I decided to come here,
it was with one thought in mind.


114
00:15:14.444 --> 00:15:17.248
Inisfree is far from being heaven, Mr Thornton.

115
00:15:17.482 --> 00:15:21.221
Ma'am, Mr Red Will Danaher
wishes to be announced,


116
00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:24.325
I mean, Squire Danaher.

117
00:15:24.525 --> 00:15:26.494
Wipe your muddy boots!

118
00:15:32.569 --> 00:15:35.272
- Mrs Tillane.
- Mr Thornton, from America.


119
00:15:35.474 --> 00:15:37.439
- Aah!
- Boo.


120
00:15:39.108 --> 00:15:41.178
It's him I'm here about, Mrs Tillane.

121
00:15:41.378 --> 00:15:43.949
- (WILL): Is it true?
- Is what true?


122
00:15:44.149 --> 00:15:48.655
That behind me back, he's trying to steal
White O' Mornin' right from under me nose?


123
00:15:48.889 --> 00:15:51.859
And what concern of
yours is this, Will Danaher?

124
00:15:52.093 --> 00:15:55.431
Concern? Concern enough!

125
00:15:56.132 --> 00:15:58.835
Haven't I made you a good fair offer
for that same piece of land?


126
00:15:59.035 --> 00:16:03.506
- And mine, lying right next to yours?
- You may keep your offers.


127
00:16:03.706 --> 00:16:08.746
- Oh, so it's true. You sold it!
- No, I have not.


128
00:16:11.885 --> 00:16:17.024
Oh, I knew it was a dirty lie
the very minute I heard it!


129
00:16:17.258 --> 00:16:19.761
Sure, I said to him,

130
00:16:19.961 --> 00:16:23.934
"Paggy McFarland, you'll never make me believe
that Sarah Tillane'd be selling White O' Mornin'."


131
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.004
(WILL): Why, it would be like building a fence
between your land and mine.


132
00:16:28.204 --> 00:16:33.845
"And for a stranger to move in", says I.
"What would she be doing that for?"


133
00:16:34.045 --> 00:16:36.749
And us so close to an understanding,
you might say.


134
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:39.986
- So you told him all that, did you?
- That I did.


135
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.724
Down at the pub, I suppose,
in front of all those big ears,


136
00:16:43.925 --> 00:16:47.463
with pints in their fists
and pipes in their mouths.


137
00:16:47.697 --> 00:16:50.932
You may have the land, Mr Thornton,
for 600 pounds!


138
00:16:51.132 --> 00:16:54.169
- Done!
- No, you can't. 610!


139
00:16:54.369 --> 00:16:57.274
As I remember,Mrs. 
Tillane, you said 700 pounds.

140
00:16:57.475 --> 00:17:01.545
See here, little man... 710!

141
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.251
- How about an even thousand?
- A thousand and...


142
00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:11.125
And... and I'll be saying good day to you,
Mrs Tillane, and all here but one.


143
00:17:11.327 --> 00:17:14.294
And I've got you down in my book!

144
00:17:17.665 --> 00:17:19.835
My dad remembers his dad well.

145
00:17:20.035 --> 00:17:23.407
Mike Thornton.
He had shoulders on him like an ox.


146
00:17:23.608 --> 00:17:29.648
I saw him meself this mornin'. A tall,
handsome man, as I was passin' the chapel.


147
00:17:29.848 --> 00:17:35.690
If you'd pass the pub as fast as you pass
the chapel, you'd be better off, ya little squint.


148
00:17:54.947 --> 00:17:57.584
Just look at them!
Eating me out of house and home.


149
00:17:57.784 --> 00:18:01.721
Get back to the fields! C'mon, all of you!
There's work to be done!


150
00:18:11.334 --> 00:18:15.471
Isn't it a bit early in the day
for the bottle... even for you?


151
00:18:15.672 --> 00:18:18.610
Feeney, get your book out.

152
00:18:21.347 --> 00:18:25.085
Set down the name, the one Sean Thornton.
(spits)


153
00:18:26.151 --> 00:18:29.689
Oh!, look at me clean floor! 
You dirty little...

154
00:18:29.889 --> 00:18:33.828
Ahhh- Shut your gob.
- Aw, shut you, little man! Here.


155
00:18:34.028 --> 00:18:37.366
Clean it up yourself,
or there won't be any dinner in this house tonight!


156
00:18:39.134 --> 00:18:44.843
There now! Look now,isn't that grand?
Miss Danaher-you mustn't mind himself this day.


157
00:18:45.077 --> 00:18:48.581
That's all the work you're good for,
you little tattletail.


158
00:18:50.214 --> 00:18:54.019
- Feeney, have you written the name I gave you?
- I have.


159
00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:59.794
Well, strike a line through it.
That's for him. Sean Thornton...


160
00:19:00.662 --> 00:19:05.234
So... He bought White O' Mornin'
in spite of you.


161
00:19:09.674 --> 00:19:12.178
Good for Widow Tillane!

162
00:19:12.745 --> 00:19:16.548
Pay no attention to her at all! 
Take no notice.

163
00:19:16.748 --> 00:19:19.785
You do, and there'll be a fine wake
in this house tonight.


164
00:19:19.985 --> 00:19:23.524
After all, he's got more right to that land
than you have!


165
00:19:32.435 --> 00:19:37.342
He'll regret it to his dying day,
if ever he lives that long.


166
00:19:40.344 --> 00:19:45.317
- Will it be all right if I leave my bags in here?
- I imagine they'll be safe enough.


167
00:19:46.385 --> 00:19:51.458
Oh,If you see a little guy, Michaleen Flynn,
would you tell him I'm waiting for him in the bar?


168
00:19:51.658 --> 00:19:55.764
- It'll be a pleasure, especially for Michaleen Flynn.
- Thanks.


169
00:19:55.964 --> 00:19:58.268
Is there anything you should like now, Yank?

170
00:20:00.371 --> 00:20:04.574
If I think of anything, 
I'll let you know.

171
00:20:10.282 --> 00:20:12.919
(BAR IS QUIET)

172
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.356
Good Evening.

173
00:20:19.828 --> 00:20:22.097
Pleasant night.

174
00:20:24.768 --> 00:20:29.104
- I'll try one of those black beers.
- Oh, the porter. Yes, sir.


175
00:20:34.178 --> 00:20:39.184
Sir, will you join me? Matter of fact,
I'd like to buy everybody a drink.


176
00:20:39.384 --> 00:20:43.757
I do not believe I
heard your name, tall man.

177
00:20:43.991 --> 00:20:46.495
Thornton. Sean Thornton.

178
00:20:48.264 --> 00:20:50.931
And... your father's name?

179
00:20:51.131 --> 00:20:56.205
Mike. Michael Thornton.
He used to live here, White O' Mornin'´.


180
00:20:56.405 --> 00:21:00.378
I just bought the place back.
That's why I'm here.


181
00:21:00.578 --> 00:21:06.118
Then your grandfather
would be Ol' Sean Thornton.


182
00:21:06.319 --> 00:21:09.924
- Right.
- Bless his memory.


183
00:21:10.157 --> 00:21:12.494
So it's himself you're named after.

184
00:21:12.694 --> 00:21:18.767
Well, now. That being the case, it is
a pleasant evening and we will have a drink.


185
00:21:21.137 --> 00:21:25.976
* There was a wild colonial boy

186
00:21:26.177 --> 00:21:30.148
# Jack Duggan was his name

187
00:21:31.017 --> 00:21:36.090
# He was born and bred in Ireland

188
00:21:36.324 --> 00:21:40.627
# In a town called Castlemaine

189
00:21:42.463 --> 00:21:44.632
- Good evening, Father.
- Is the rest of the committee here?


190
00:21:44.833 --> 00:21:46.569
- They're waiting.
- Sorry we're late.


191
00:21:46.802 --> 00:21:51.875
- The fishing was bad, was it?
- Fishing? Fine lot of time we had for that!


192
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.380
- Oh, Michaleen...
- Commander Forbes.


193
00:21:55.581 --> 00:21:59.553
You can forget about the comments.
We're at peace now, man.


194
00:21:59.753 --> 00:22:02.621
Sure, but I haven't given up hope.

195
00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:07.494
- Your Yankee friend is waitin' in the bar.
- Oh, he's here already...


196
00:22:07.728 --> 00:22:10.165
Wait a minute now, Michaleen. 
Who is he anyway?

197
00:22:10.398 --> 00:22:16.139
He's a nice, quiet, peacelovin' man
come home to Ireland to forget his troubles.


198
00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:20.813
- Troubles?
- Yes, he's a millionaire, like all the Yanks.


199
00:22:21.046 --> 00:22:24.384
But, oh,  he is eccentric. 
Wait till I show you.

200
00:22:26.518 --> 00:22:31.157
- What is it?
- A bag to sleep in. A sleeping bag they call it.


201
00:22:31.358 --> 00:22:36.098
I'm tellin' you. The sleeping bag...
Wait till I show you how it operates.


202
00:22:36.331 --> 00:22:38.967
- Where does it open?
- Hurry up, I have an important appointment.


203
00:22:39.167 --> 00:22:41.271
- Well, open it up!
- Here.


204
00:22:41.471 --> 00:22:46.011
# At the early age of sixteen years

205
00:22:46.211 --> 00:22:50.281
# He left his native home

206
00:22:50.481 --> 00:22:55.354
# And to Australia's sunny shores

207
00:22:55.555 --> 00:22:59.961
# He was inclined to roam

208
00:23:00.161 --> 00:23:04.700
# He robbed a wealthy squireen

209
00:23:04.934 --> 00:23:09.407
# All arms he did destroy

210
00:23:09.607 --> 00:23:14.110
# A terror to Australia was

211
00:23:14.311 --> 00:23:19.117
# This wild colonial boy

212
00:23:20.219 --> 00:23:26.694
Sean Thornton, the men of Inisfree
bid you welcome home.


213
00:23:26.894 --> 00:23:28.830
Thank you.

214
00:23:29.531 --> 00:23:33.871
"And the men of Inisfree
bid you welcome home."


215
00:23:34.605 --> 00:23:38.107
- What's wrong with that little speech?
- Oh, you'd be knowin' what, Squire.


216
00:23:45.718 --> 00:23:49.289
I'm a man from
Inisfree, and the best man!

217
00:23:49.923 --> 00:23:52.426
And I bid no welcome
to any man fool enough

218
00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:56.933
to pay 1000 pounds for a bit of land
that isn't worth 200!


219
00:23:57.133 --> 00:23:58.736
True for you, squire.

220
00:23:58.936 --> 00:24:05.174
(MAN): Didn't I hear, of someone
named Danaher, bid 810?


221
00:24:07.611 --> 00:24:13.052
Get your book out.
Put his name down: Dermot Fahy.


222
00:24:13.252 --> 00:24:17.357
F
-A
-H
-Y. No e's, Squireen Danaher.

223
00:24:17.558 --> 00:24:19.260
If you were half the
man you think you are,

224
00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.766
you wouldn't begrudge a Thornton
the right to his own birthplace.
And, that's my opinion on it.


225
00:24:22.966 --> 00:24:26.634
- What right has he to a land he's never worked?
- It's Thornton land, isn't it?


226
00:24:26.868 --> 00:24:30.173
- You've too much of your own as it is.
- Quiet, if you please.


227
00:24:30.373 --> 00:24:34.445
Parliamentary procedure.
Squire Danaher has the floor.


228
00:24:34.645 --> 00:24:37.617
If I had the floor...

229
00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:41.788
- ... I'd hit that big ape with it.
- Hold on.


230
00:24:41.988 --> 00:24:45.060
I don't blame Mr Danaher
for gettin' on his ear.

231
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:49.564
Who's on his ear? Why, you and ten soldiers
like you couldn't put a Danaher on his ear.


232
00:24:49.763 --> 00:24:52.767
- It's just a way of speaking...
- Well then, Mind your ways, then.


233
00:24:52.968 --> 00:24:58.442
The point is, it's already done. I own
the property now, and as long as we´re going to be neighbours...


234
00:24:58.642 --> 00:25:01.012
Neighbours? Neighbours...

235
00:25:02.313 --> 00:25:03.715
Never!

236
00:25:03.916 --> 00:25:08.321
And if I so much as catch you putting
one foot on my property, I... I...


237
00:25:08.556 --> 00:25:12.761
And, oh, another thing.
You keep away from my sister Mary Kate.


238
00:25:12.995 --> 00:25:15.061
She's not for the likes of you.

239
00:25:15.262 --> 00:25:19.468
Where I come from, we don't talk
about our womenfolk in saloons.


240
00:25:19.668 --> 00:25:22.773
You sort of make a habit of it.
This morning it was Widow Tillane.


241
00:25:22.973 --> 00:25:27.144
- What's that?
- That's true. It's ashamed you should be.


242
00:25:27.344 --> 00:25:31.584
Hey, look, I'm not accusing Mary Kate.
It's him!


243
00:25:31.784 --> 00:25:35.390
Why, this very moment,
let him deny it if he can.


244
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.925
At the back of the chapel,
he took liberties that he shouldn't have.


245
00:25:39.158 --> 00:25:42.330
- I said "good morning" to her.
- Good morning?


246
00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:45.634
- yeah,but It was "good night" you had
on your mind. That's a lie.

(MUSIC STOPS)

248
00:25:48.738 --> 00:25:51.308
- That's a what?
- I said "that's a lie".


249
00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:57.383
That's a word I take from no man!
Put up your fists!


250
00:25:57.584 --> 00:25:59.954
- I'm not gonna fight you.
- But I'm gonna fight you...


251
00:26:02.654 --> 00:26:04.457
Thank you.

252
00:26:06.961 --> 00:26:10.131
(FATHER): Danaher!
What's the matter with you?


253
00:26:10.365 --> 00:26:13.302
(FORBES): He's drunk!
Feeney, take him home, will you.


254
00:26:13.503 --> 00:26:16.139
(FEENEY): Don't soil your knuckles on the man.

255
00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.977
- Come on,Danaher, what do you say?
- Never!


256
00:26:19.177 --> 00:26:21.814
Take the man's hand, or I'll read your name
in a mass on Sunday.


257
00:26:22.047 --> 00:26:25.085
- (FEENEY): Take it.
- I'd join the Church of Ireland first.


258
00:26:25.284 --> 00:26:29.655
As if they'd have you. Now, go on. shake his hand.
Shake his hand like I tell you.


259
00:26:29.855 --> 00:26:32.994
- (FEENEY): Come on, come on.
- Shake hands?


260
00:26:40.436 --> 00:26:45.343
It's a good grip you have, Danaher.
I always hated a flabby handshake myself.


261
00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.057
Father Paul!

262
00:26:57.291 --> 00:27:01.829
Michaleen, introduce me to this quiet,
peacelovin' man of yours.


263
00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:05.401
I have a strange notion
we're going to be friends, Yank.


264
00:27:05.601 --> 00:27:09.240
Well,Give me a minute.
Just let some blood run back into this.

Sean Thornton... His grandfather,oh
a grand man he was, was hung in Australia.


266
00:27:16.347 --> 00:27:21.788
Oooh,I could tell you blood-curdlin' stories
about him,but me throat...me throat...


267
00:27:21.988 --> 00:27:24.625

00:28:44.292 --> 00:28:49.232
Are you sure you won't change your mind,Sean,
and come around home with me?


275
00:28:49.463 --> 00:28:53.168
Don't worry about it.
I've got my sleeping bag, haven't I?


276
00:28:54.003 --> 00:28:57.141
Well, it's a nice, soft night.

277
00:28:57.341 --> 00:29:02.046
So, I think I'll go and join me comrades,
and talk a little treason.


278
00:29:02.847 --> 00:29:05.418
- Good night, Sean.
- Good night, Michaleen.

00:31:11.961 --> 00:31:15.395
- So you can talk?
- Yes, I can, I will, and I do!


284
00:31:15.596 --> 00:31:18.166
It's more than talk you'll be gettin'
if you step a step closer to me!


285
00:31:18.366 --> 00:31:21.905
- Don't worry. You've got a wallop.
- You'll get over it, I'm thinkin'.


286
00:31:22.139 --> 00:31:26.276
Some things a man
doesn't get over so easily.

287
00:31:26.477 --> 00:31:29.081
Like what, supposin'?

288
00:31:29.281 --> 00:31:34.522
Like the sight of a girl coming through the fields,
with the sun on her hair.


289
00:31:35.823 --> 00:31:40.694
- Kneeling in church, with a face like a saint.
- Saint, indeed!


290
00:31:40.895 --> 00:31:44.733
And now, coming to a man's house
to clean it for him.


291
00:31:44.933 --> 00:31:48.238
But... that was just my way
of bein' a good Christian act.


292
00:31:48.439 --> 00:31:52.476
I know it was, Mary Kate Danaher,
and it was nice of you.


293
00:31:56.015 --> 00:31:58.218
Oh, Not at all.

294
00:33:11.576 --> 00:33:15.279
- Hello.
- Good morning, Mr Thornton.


295
00:33:15.612 --> 00:33:18.750
- How are you, Fa..Doctor...
- No, no. Mr.


296
00:33:18.951 --> 00:33:22.689
And on formal occasions,
the Reverend Mr Playfair.


297
00:33:22.889 --> 00:33:24.625
And this is Mrs Playfair.

298
00:33:24.859 --> 00:33:29.331
(MRS PLAYFAIR): Well, Mr Thornton.
You are a wonder.


299
00:33:29.531 --> 00:33:35.673
It looks the way all the Irish cottages
should... and so seldom do.


300
00:33:35.874 --> 00:33:40.443
And only an American
would have thought of emerald green.


301
00:33:40.644 --> 00:33:45.818
- Red is more durable.
- And the roses! How nice.


302
00:33:46.018 --> 00:33:51.959
You'll need lots of horse manure.
Fertiliser, I mean. Horse is the best.


303
00:33:52.159 --> 00:33:58.401
Oh, I brought you a plant.
You know, "a primrose by a river's brink".


304
00:33:58.602 --> 00:34:02.838
"Brim", not "brink".
The next line ends in "hymn".


305
00:34:03.038 --> 00:34:07.678
Poets are so silly, aren't they?
Oh, I hope you're not one, Mr Thornton.


306
00:34:07.878 --> 00:34:11.049
- Oh no, ma'am, I...
- Thornton.


307
00:34:12.185 --> 00:34:14.387
There's a familiar ring to it.

308
00:34:16.857 --> 00:34:20.295
Ring to it... Thornton...

309
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:25.202
It's a common name.
Thank you for the plant, Mrs Playfair,


310
00:34:25.401 --> 00:34:28.804
this is damn... darn... awfully nice of you.

311
00:34:29.972 --> 00:34:32.009
Oh?

312
00:34:47.162 --> 00:34:50.364
It's a bed. Excuse me.

313
00:34:53.301 --> 00:34:57.106
- Morning.
- (MAN): That's a fine big bed, Mr Thornton.


314
00:34:57.307 --> 00:34:59.944
Biggest one I could find.

315
00:35:14.297 --> 00:35:17.565
Is that a bed or a parade ground?

316
00:35:17.765 --> 00:35:21.805
Oh, a man'd have to be a sprinter
to catch his wife in a bed like that.


317
00:35:33.153 --> 00:35:35.357
(HORSE WHINNIES)

318
00:35:37.325 --> 00:35:39.158
Whew!

319
00:35:57.017 --> 00:36:02.923
Mr Flynn... And what are you
all dressed up for, Michaleen Oge?


320
00:36:06.059 --> 00:36:08.195
I ha...

321
00:36:13.436 --> 00:36:17.441
- I have come...
- Oh, I can see that.


322
00:36:17.641 --> 00:36:21.180
- But from whose pub was it?
- P... pub?


323
00:36:22.281 --> 00:36:27.419
You've a tongue like an adder.
I've a good mind to go about me own business,


324
00:36:27.619 --> 00:36:31.958
and tell Thorn Seanton
he's well off without you!


325
00:36:32.159 --> 00:36:35.731
Wait a minute. 
What was that?

326
00:36:35.931 --> 00:36:41.204
Well, if you listened
and not be interruptin' the Schockelhorn-the matchmaker.


327
00:36:44.241 --> 00:36:47.947
I have come...

328
00:36:48.147 --> 00:36:52.984
- ... at the request of Thorn Seanton...
- Sean Thornton.


329
00:36:53.185 --> 00:36:54.853
Shut up.

330
00:36:55.922 --> 00:37:00.528
... bachelor, and party of the first part...

331
00:37:03.365 --> 00:37:09.374
... to ask of
you, strictly and formally, here...

332
00:37:10.174 --> 00:37:14.447
... Mary Kate Danaher, (grins) spinster...

333
00:37:15.345 --> 00:37:17.648
... and party to the second part...

334
00:37:21.554 --> 00:37:24.892
Well?. Go on, you were sayin'?

335
00:37:25.092 --> 00:37:31.401
Me mouth is like a dry crust,
and the sun is that hot, on me face...


336
00:37:31.634 --> 00:37:34.104
Would you be steppin' into the parlour?

337
00:37:34.304 --> 00:37:39.909
The house may belong to my brother,
but what's in the parlour belongs to me.


338
00:37:40.109 --> 00:37:45.484
I will then, and I hope that there's a bottle there,
whoever it belongs to.


339
00:37:45.718 --> 00:37:47.487
It could be.

340
00:37:56.733 --> 00:37:59.737
You have a fine, steady hand.

341
00:38:14.121 --> 00:38:16.557
To a good bargaining.

342
00:38:22.298 --> 00:38:24.134
To resume:

343
00:38:24.367 --> 00:38:26.504
- The party of the first part...
- That's him.


344
00:38:26.704 --> 00:38:33.010
... has instructed me to enquire
before enterin' into formal negotiations...


345
00:38:33.244 --> 00:38:36.415
- ... whether the party to the second part...
- That's me.


346
00:38:36.615 --> 00:38:43.056
... thinks kindly of the general idea,
or in his own words..eh.. American, eh...


347
00:38:43.724 --> 00:38:48.097
- ... eh, yes, he wants to know if you "go for it".
- "Go for it"?


348
00:38:48.331 --> 00:38:53.301
- And if you do, he'll speak to your brother.
- That won't be easy.


349
00:38:53.502 --> 00:38:55.538
Oh, as well I know it.

350
00:38:55.738 --> 00:39:00.845
He'd as soon put his self and his fist
into my teeth as bid me the time of the day.


351
00:39:02.181 --> 00:39:06.752
Now tell me, What did Sean... I mean,the party of
the first part,say about my fortune?


352
00:39:06.952 --> 00:39:09.624
He says he doesn't give it...

353
00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.597
He says it's a matter of
complete indifference to him.


354
00:39:14.797 --> 00:39:19.101
- He did?
- He says he doesn't give a shi...


355
00:39:19.334 --> 00:39:25.576
He says it's all one to him if you come
in the clothes on your back, or without
them for that matter..


356
00:39:30.082 --> 00:39:33.353
Oh, he did, did he? Well...

357
00:39:33.554 --> 00:39:38.360
A fine opinion he must have of me, if he thinks
I'd go to any man without a proper fortune.


358
00:39:38.561 --> 00:39:41.829
And this you may tell
your Mr Party of the first part:


359
00:39:42.029 --> 00:39:46.502
That When I wed, whatever's
my own, goes with me.

360
00:39:46.736 --> 00:39:48.305
Get up, little man!

361
00:39:56.716 --> 00:39:58.685
And all this furniture is mine.

362
00:39:58.885 --> 00:40:02.857
And I have that china, and linen,
and 50 pounds in gold my father left me,


363
00:40:03.055 --> 00:40:08.396
and my mother's rings, brooches,
my grandmother's wedding veil, her silver
comb, and buckles...


364
00:40:09.164 --> 00:40:15.838
Thirty pounds odd in notes and silver
I've earned these past 15 years, that's all.


365
00:40:17.341 --> 00:40:22.815
You're a well propertied woman.
I wouldn't mind marryin' you meself...


366
00:40:26.253 --> 00:40:29.555
Eh, where'd you leave the bottle?

367
00:40:33.093 --> 00:40:38.100
And I'd have you tell him, that I'm no pauper
to be going to him in my shift!


368
00:40:49.381 --> 00:40:55.053
# Lo, young May moon is beamin', Love

369
00:40:55.253 --> 00:41:00.795
# The glow-worm's lamp is gleamin',Love

370
00:41:01.028 --> 00:41:06.935
# How sweet to rove through Mourna's Grove

371
00:41:08.137 --> 00:41:14.747
# While the drowsy world is dreamin', Love...

372
00:41:14.947 --> 00:41:17.681
- You know "The Peter And The Goat".?
- I do not.


373
00:41:17.882 --> 00:41:22.488
- Neither do I.
- Could you use a little water in your whiskey?


374
00:41:22.688 --> 00:41:28.930
When I drink whiskey, I drink whiskey,
and when I drink water, I drink water.


375
00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:31.967
Back to business now.

376
00:41:32.168 --> 00:41:36.707
What answer will I give Sean Thornton,
Mary Kate Danaher?


377
00:41:36.908 --> 00:41:40.376
Well, you can tell him from me that...

378
00:41:44.048 --> 00:41:46.618
... that I "go for it".

379
00:41:46.818 --> 00:41:52.459
# Here's to steal a
few hours from the night

380
00:41:53.194 --> 00:41:56.999
# My dear...

381
00:42:11.417 --> 00:42:14.087
- How do I look?
- You look fine.


382
00:42:35.179 --> 00:42:38.517
- Hey, what do I say?
- I'll do all the talkin'.


383
00:42:38.718 --> 00:42:43.122
- And I'm suppose to stand here like a dummy?
- Shh, now.


384
00:42:49.164 --> 00:42:54.035
- Will, there's someone coming to call.
- Who?


385
00:42:54.235 --> 00:42:56.473
It's... well...

386
00:42:56.706 --> 00:43:00.911
It's Michaleen Oge Flynn,
and there's a gentleman with him.


387
00:43:03.447 --> 00:43:06.184
Here, Will, put on your coat.

388
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.524
Will Danaher, they're comin' to the front door!

389
00:43:10.724 --> 00:43:13.862
Since when has the back door
been not good enough?


390
00:43:23.005 --> 00:43:25.676
- (MICHALEEN): God bless all in this house.
- (SEAN): Good evening.


391
00:43:25.909 --> 00:43:29.080
(MICHALEEN): Miss Danaher,
we'd like a word with your brother.


392
00:43:30.748 --> 00:43:33.853
Come on in so, and welcome.

393
00:43:34.721 --> 00:43:37.325
Easy now!

394
00:43:43.063 --> 00:43:49.772
Mr Sean Thornton, bachelor,
meet Miss Mary Kate Danaher, spinster.


395
00:43:50.874 --> 00:43:57.049
Miss Danaher, meet Mr Thornton
from Pittsburgh, Massachusetts?, USA.


396
00:43:57.616 --> 00:44:00.587
- Good evening, Miss Danaher.
- This...


397
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:04.523
This way, please.

398
00:44:14.437 --> 00:44:16.773
- Eh, this is my brother...
- Leave the room.


399
00:44:16.973 --> 00:44:20.111
- But...
- I said, leave the room.


400
00:44:20.311 --> 00:44:24.550
- Yes, Will.
- Sit down, that's what chairs are for.


401
00:44:24.751 --> 00:44:30.355
- If you've come for supper, you're late.
- Gracious invitation, but thank you, no.


402
00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:34.828
I don't suppose there's
a drop in the house.

403
00:44:35.029 --> 00:44:40.101
- Help yourself to the buttermilk.
- Buttermilk? The Borgias would do better.


404
00:44:40.302 --> 00:44:46.244
We'll come with your permission
to the object of this visit.


405
00:44:46.477 --> 00:44:53.251
You've noticed, I presume,
that I'm wearin' my official black coat.


406
00:44:53.451 --> 00:44:56.790
I have. For your dead friend here?

407
00:44:57.991 --> 00:45:00.394
(WILL): I need no trouble
to arrange any marriages for me.


408
00:45:00.594 --> 00:45:06.601
I see. You've been making fine progress
with widow Tillane in the last ten years.


409
00:45:06.802 --> 00:45:09.173
- Is that what you've come to talk about?
- I have not.


410
00:45:09.406 --> 00:45:13.078
- I've come to talk about your sister Mary Kate and him.
- Aw, get out!


411
00:45:13.278 --> 00:45:16.981
If he was the last man
on the face of the earth, and, she were the last
woman, I'd still say no!


412
00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:20.953
- Now just a minute.
- If it's a question of the girl's fortune...


413
00:45:21.153 --> 00:45:25.425
Fortune?? Why, if it'd be a shilling piece
he wanted with her...


414
00:45:25.625 --> 00:45:29.063
- ... I'd still say no.
- Come on, Michaleen. I told you so.


415
00:45:29.263 --> 00:45:32.836
- I'll explain it to her myself.
- Hey, Yank, I'll count three.


416
00:45:33.036 --> 00:45:36.140
If you're not out of the house by then,
I'll loose the dogs on you.


417
00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:41.711
If you say three, mister,
you'll never hear the man count ten.


418
00:45:53.794 --> 00:45:59.269
- Oh, Mary Kate, we tried.
- We'll see him again some other time.


419
00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:06.977
I thank you anyway,
Sean Thornton, for the asking.


420
00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:12.317
You don't think this changes anything?
It's what you say that counts, not him.


421
00:46:12.518 --> 00:46:14.888
Now, now, Sean.
You've gone too far, that's enough.


422
00:46:15.088 --> 00:46:19.694
Say, what is this?
We're gonna get married, aren't we?

- This is Ireland, Sean, not America.

Without her brother's consent she couldn't,
and wouldn't. I'm sorry for both of you.

Those were the bad days. Sean with a face
as dark as the black hunter he rode.


426

A fine, ill-tempered pair they were.

before one or the other broke his neck.

Hello, Mary Kate... Danaher.

431
00:47:52.709 --> 00:47:56.248
Good morning, Sean Thornton.

432
00:48:04.957 --> 00:48:07.427
So, we formed a little conspiracy.

433

The Reverend Mr and Mrs Playfair,
Michaleen Oge and, saints forgive us, myself.


434
00:48:15.204 --> 00:48:20.645
And on the day of the Inisfree Races,
we sprung the trap on Red Will Danaher.

Remember, you make your speed
when you hit the water.

- Yes, father.
- And ride carefully, my son.


437
00:49:04.166 --> 00:49:05.567
Yes, mum.

438
00:49:05.767 --> 00:49:07.770
Thornton, no silks.

439
00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:10.440
- Your colours, Thornton.
- Thank you.


440

- Good luck.
- Good luck.

Will all the lovely ladies,

443
00:49:49.455 --> 00:49:54.127

for the Inisfree Cup,


444

- Indeed, I will not.

- No?
- No!

Crown at 20 to 1 on the Yank.
I'm given 20 to 1 on the Yank...


452
00:50:42.152 --> 00:50:47.426
- I'm given 30 to 1... 40 to 1 on Danaher.
- Flynn!


453

If you´ve been doing any matchmaking between
Thornton and my widow, I'll put you in me book!


454
00:50:54.233 --> 00:50:59.774
- Ah, so you've heard?
- Father Lonergan, what sort of a
scoundrel is this Yank?


455
00:50:59.974 --> 00:51:02.978
One minute it's me sister,
and the next it's herself.


456
00:51:03.178 --> 00:51:05.147
Well, blame no one but yourself.

457
00:51:05.347 --> 00:51:09.687
If you'd saved me as your matchmaker,
you and the widow would've been married long since.


458
00:51:09.921 --> 00:51:13.826
- True, Will, true.
- I'm not saying it's too late yet.


459
00:51:14.027 --> 00:51:19.631
- What do you mean?
- Why do ya suppose the Widow Tillane has
stood you up so long?


460
00:51:19.831 --> 00:51:22.102
- You're a fine looking man.
- I am.

- And well she knows it.

- Father, will I tell him?
- Go ahead, Michaleen.

What woman would come into a house
with another woman in it?


464
00:51:34.152 --> 00:51:38.757
If you got rid of Mary Kate,
the widow would be in like a shot.

- No.
- Yes. You had your chance and you flubbed it.

You refused Seaneen Thornton,
and he reneged on you.


467

Now, I doubt if he'd take your sister
if you put 1000 pounds on her.


468
00:51:53.107 --> 00:51:57.513
- Father Lonergan?
- I can't say it's true, and I won't say it's not.


469
00:51:57.714 --> 00:52:01.386
- But there's been talk.
- Oh, a lot of talk.

A lot of talk, eh?

- Yeah. For the roses.


710
01:28:38.358 --> 01:28:40.126
Roses, again.

711
01:28:41.663 --> 01:28:44.099
You...

712
01:28:47.803 --> 01:28:51.041
We could do our shopping in Castletown,

713
01:28:51.241 --> 01:28:54.778
and if we put a good foot under us,
we'd be back by suppertime.


714
01:28:55.012 --> 01:28:57.447
- Five miles!
- Well, that's just a...


715
01:28:57.648 --> 01:29:00.386
Good stretch of the legs, huh?

716
01:29:02.588 --> 01:29:05.893
All right, get on your walking shoes.

717
01:29:10.966 --> 01:29:13.436
I'll be a minute.

718
01:29:31.191 --> 01:29:33.427
(HONKING FROM OUTSIDE)

719
01:29:34.796 --> 01:29:36.565
(HONKING FROM OUTSIDE)

720
01:29:39.735 --> 01:29:42.038
So, you're not a woman
to be honked at, ha?

721
01:29:42.738 --> 01:29:46.275
Why, it's beautiful! 
Did you ever see...

722
01:29:46.475 --> 01:29:50.715
- It looks like it could fly.
- Only one horsepower, but it's all yours.


723
01:29:51.515 --> 01:29:54.587
- Mine?
- Sure. Think you can drive it?


724
01:29:54.821 --> 01:29:57.156
Hold on to your hat!

725
01:31:04.872 --> 01:31:06.675
(RED WILL): You take care of that, Feeney.

726
01:31:12.716 --> 01:31:17.857
- Let's have another pint. I'm buying this one.
- High time.


727
01:31:18.056 --> 01:31:21.326
- What's that?
- I said, that's fine, squire, fine..


728
01:31:22.794 --> 01:31:25.097
Good health to you all.

729
01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.371
- Look, he sold the crossbreds.
- The what?


730
01:31:30.471 --> 01:31:32.441
- The sheep he's been planning on.
- Oh.


731
01:31:32.574 --> 01:31:36.178
Hurry, now is a good time
to ask him. Well, go on.

732
01:31:36.346 --> 01:31:39.483
- Ask him what?
- About my money.


733
01:31:39.583 --> 01:31:41.552
He can't say that he
hasn't got it with him now.

734
01:31:41.786 --> 01:31:45.589
Can't you get it through your head, that
I didn't marry you for your fortune?


735
01:31:45.789 --> 01:31:51.464
- I don't give... a hang about the money.
- But he does! That's the whole point of it.


736
01:31:51.764 --> 01:31:56.304
- Now will you go and ask him?
- No. Why shame ourselves?


737
01:31:56.437 --> 01:32:02.379
Shame? The shame's on you, not on me.
Or on me too, if I married a coward.


738
01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:05.850
Is that what you think of me?

739
01:32:05.983 --> 01:32:08.451
What else if you let him rob
you out of my money?


740
01:32:08.552 --> 01:32:14.493
Money! I'm sick of the talk of it.
Is that all you Danahers think about? Money?


741
01:33:48.043 --> 01:33:52.048
(FATHER): Quiet! 
He's just behind that rock.

742
01:33:52.248 --> 01:33:55.453
- This is very important...
- Oh, salmon! He's winking at me.


743
01:33:55.653 --> 01:33:57.889
I've been trying to catch
this one for ten years.

744
01:33:58.089 --> 01:34:02.095
I've got to talk to
you about my husband and myself.

745
01:34:02.295 --> 01:34:04.364
There he is.

746
01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:08.401
Father, I... I...

747
01:34:11.638 --> 01:34:13.308
You see...

748
01:34:14.343 --> 01:34:19.016
- Father, could I... tell you in the Irish?
- Hush, hush hush hush...


749
01:34:22.019 --> 01:34:32.019
Níor lig mé m'fhear chéile isteach i mo leaba liom... aréir.
Chuir mé fuinneamh air a chodladh i ... oh ...
i mála codlata! Mála codlata!


750
01:34:38.239 --> 01:34:41.544
(Father Lonergan)Mála codlata?
Céard é sin -- 'bag'?


751
01:34:43.213 --> 01:34:46.416
Sleeping bag, Father, with...

752
01:34:48.085 --> 01:34:50.622
... with buttons.

753
01:34:53.626 --> 01:34:59.062
Más breá é -- níor rith
sé|ar a shon. An peaca é?

754
01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:06.241
Woman, Ireland may be a
poor country, God help us,

755
01:35:06.474 --> 01:35:10.346
but here a married man sleeps
in a bed, not a bag,

756
01:35:10.546 --> 01:35:15.620
and for your own good... 
Help, help, there he is!

757
01:35:16.955 --> 01:35:19.657
- I've been waiting for this for 10 years!
- Keep his head up.


758
01:35:19.857 --> 01:35:24.597
- There's that beauty, that...
- Keep his head up. Keep a tight line.


759
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:28.668
I've got you! I'll get him!

760
01:35:30.338 --> 01:35:33.442
- Tight line it is.
- Keep his head up!


761
01:35:33.675 --> 01:35:36.246
His head is up!

762
01:35:37.881 --> 01:35:43.020
(FATHER): For ten years I have...
Get the net, woman.


763
01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:47.893
Oh, you got him, Father. 
Keep his head up, you fool!

764
01:35:48.894 --> 01:35:50.263
Get the net!

765
01:35:52.331 --> 01:35:54.869
Get the net, woman!

766
01:35:56.371 --> 01:36:00.075
- God help us!
- Oh....


767
01:36:03.947 --> 01:36:06.248
Sleeping bags...!

768
01:36:54.043 --> 01:36:58.313
# If you ever go
across the sea to Ireland

769
01:36:59.248 --> 01:37:06.391
# Then maybe at
the closin' of your day

770
01:37:07.493 --> 01:37:12.266
# You will sit
and watch the moon rise

771
01:37:12.466 --> 01:37:16.704
# Over Claddagh

772
01:37:17.473 --> 01:37:22.377
# And see the sun go down

773
01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:28.351
# On Galway Bay

774
01:37:30.021 --> 01:37:37.197
# For the breeze is
blowin' across the sea from Ireland

775
01:37:38.332 --> 01:37:40.467
(SINGING STOPS)

776
01:37:41.670 --> 01:37:44.672
You're just in time. 
Just done me drink.

777
01:37:44.872 --> 01:37:47.574
- Join us, Sean.
- Oh, you will have a drink, Sean?


778
01:37:47.742 --> 01:37:49.745
No, thanks.

779
01:37:52.748 --> 01:37:55.654
I wanna talk to you, in private.

780
01:37:59.190 --> 01:38:03.930
- If there's anythin' you got to say to me, say it here.
- I'd rather talk to you in private.


781
01:38:04.130 --> 01:38:09.235
What's the matter? You're among friends.
They fought for you once, didn't they?


782
01:38:09.436 --> 01:38:14.209
- Maybe they'll fight for you again.
- I'm not askin' anybody to do my fightin' for me.


783
01:38:14.409 --> 01:38:20.451
- Oh, so you're willing to do your own, are you?
- You know what I came for.


784
01:38:20.651 --> 01:38:24.723
I do. I just want
to hear you ask for it.

785
01:38:24.923 --> 01:38:28.361
Just ask for it, Yank. And, you'll be chewin'
your teeth for a week!


786
01:38:28.561 --> 01:38:32.465
- You've got 20 pounds on him.
- And so I have.


787
01:38:34.133 --> 01:38:39.674
What if I put one of me fists in me pocket?
Right or left? You choose, go on.


788
01:38:39.907 --> 01:38:43.046
Go on, that's fair enough, isn't it?

789
01:38:45.548 --> 01:38:47.417
(WILL LAUGHS)

790
01:38:48.052 --> 01:38:51.023
The fightin' Thornton!

791
01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:21.558
- It was Mr Thornton, so I brought him in.
- Bless my soul. Sit down.


792
01:39:21.759 --> 01:39:23.827
- Have you tiddled your last wink?
- I have.


793
01:39:24.027 --> 01:39:26.165
- No cheating?
- I have not.


794
01:39:26.866 --> 01:39:31.472
- Do you play tiddly-winks?
- No, I...


795
01:39:31.672 --> 01:39:37.179
- Maybe I shouldn't have butted in like this...
- Nonsense. How is your lovely bride?


796
01:39:37.379 --> 01:39:41.151
- Fine.
- Elizabeth, say good night to Mr Thornton.


797
01:39:41.351 --> 01:39:46.856
But he's only just come... oh. Very well.
Good night, Mr Thornton.


798
01:39:47.056 --> 01:39:49.026
- Good night.
- Good night, Cyril.


799
01:39:49.226 --> 01:39:53.064
Good night, Elizabeth. 
Pleasant dreams.

800
01:39:55.369 --> 01:39:58.539
- Are you sure...
- Good night, Elizabeth.


801
01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:04.013
You're the only one I can level with.
I gotta talk to somebody, or I'll blow my top.


802
01:40:04.213 --> 01:40:07.450
- Danaher, of course?
- Yeah.


803
01:40:07.650 --> 01:40:12.389
Since you know who I am... or was,
you know why I don't want any fighting.


804
01:40:12.589 --> 01:40:16.127
Yes, I was reading
about it again this evening.

805
01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:23.036
Some men collect butterflies, some stamps.
My hobby's always been sporting events.


806
01:40:23.236 --> 01:40:25.272
There it is.

807
01:40:25.473 --> 01:40:27.576
"Trooper Thorn quits ring"

808
01:40:27.776 --> 01:40:31.680
"Heavyweight challenger hangs up gloves
after fatal knockout"


809
01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:33.982
"Vows he will never fight again"

810
01:40:36.284 --> 01:40:38.722
It's a very understandable reaction.

811
01:40:38.956 --> 01:40:44.131
The papers all say it was an accident.
Just one of those things.


812
01:40:44.364 --> 01:40:50.171
It's just one of those things in a scrapbook,
but when you carry it around in here...


813
01:40:52.073 --> 01:40:55.810
Tony Gardello was a good egg.

814
01:40:56.010 --> 01:41:01.951
Nice little wife and a home, a couple of kids.
A clean fighter.


815
01:41:02.819 --> 01:41:07.659
I didn't go in there to outbox him.
I went there to beat his brains out.


816
01:41:07.859 --> 01:41:12.431
To drive him into the canvas, to murder him.
That's what I did.


817
01:41:13.065 --> 01:41:17.906
For what? Purse, a piece of the gate.

818
01:41:19.606 --> 01:41:21.642
Lousy money.

819
01:41:21.842 --> 01:41:25.346
And now money is
behind your trouble with Danaher.

820
01:41:25.547 --> 01:41:30.987
They think I'm afraid of fighting.
All the friends I've made, even my wife.


821
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:35.560
- Well, aren't you in a way?
- Did you ever kill a man?


822
01:41:37.129 --> 01:41:42.234
Well, I have, and all this talk about
her big fortune...


823
01:41:43.203 --> 01:41:45.572
It's not that important.

824
01:41:46.806 --> 01:41:49.043
Perhaps it is to her.

825
01:41:50.245 --> 01:41:54.851
It must be strange to you from America,

826
01:41:55.052 --> 01:41:59.523
but it's an old, old custom here, a
nd believe me,it's a good custom.


827
01:41:59.723 --> 01:42:02.595
The fortune means more to
her than just the money.

828
01:42:02.795 --> 01:42:06.698
Not to me, it isn't. 
Not worth fighting for.

829
01:42:06.898 --> 01:42:10.603
- Is your wife's love worth fighting for?
- I don't know.


830
01:42:12.205 --> 01:42:19.282
All I know is that...I can't fight, I won't fight,
unless I'm mad enough to kill,


831
01:42:19.482 --> 01:42:23.186
and if that means
losin' her... I don't know.

832
01:42:24.053 --> 01:42:28.360
- Maybe she doesn't love me enough..
- It's a difficult situation.


833
01:42:29.762 --> 01:42:33.265
I think you'll find the
right answer in God's good time.

834
01:42:33.498 --> 01:42:36.936
And when that time comes, 
I hope I'm still here.

835
01:42:37.136 --> 01:42:41.041
- You're not leaving, are you?
- It's a possibility.


836
01:42:41.241 --> 01:42:44.947
My bishop is coming
tomorrow on his annual visit,

837
01:42:45.181 --> 01:42:50.488
and I've got such a small congregation,
just 2-3 people at the service.


838
01:42:50.688 --> 01:42:55.793
- He may transfer me.
- The place wouldn't be the same without you, Padre.


839
01:42:56.727 --> 01:43:02.368
Elizabeth and I just love this place.
We were born here too, you know.


840
01:43:03.036 --> 01:43:06.807
The bishop's a good egg,
maybe it'll be all right.

841
01:43:07.008 --> 01:43:11.680
Oh, by the way. 
Don't underestimate Danaher.

842
01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:16.186
He may be clumsy, but he's got
a tremendous right and a jaw of granite.


843
01:43:19.022 --> 01:43:22.559
I did a little bit
of boxing in my time.

844
01:43:32.141 --> 01:43:34.542
You won't be laughin' now, will you?

845
01:43:37.246 --> 01:43:39.449
It was at Trinity.

846
01:43:39.649 --> 01:43:42.886
"Lightweight champion, 19... "

847
01:43:43.086 --> 01:43:47.056
The year doesn't matter. 
It was long, long ago.

848
01:43:49.895 --> 01:43:52.631
All right!

849
01:43:53.231 --> 01:43:55.970
By the way, would you
join me in a glass of...

850
01:43:57.070 --> 01:43:59.139
Oh, no.

851
01:44:00.475 --> 01:44:04.413
No. You'll be in training now, of course.

852
01:45:14.501 --> 01:45:18.671
- (MARY KATE): Did you have any supper?
- No.


853
01:45:18.872 --> 01:45:21.008
(SEAN): I'm not hungry.

854
01:45:21.208 --> 01:45:26.215
- The drink sometimes does that to a man.
- I haven't had anything to drink.


855
01:45:26.448 --> 01:45:31.455
(SEAN): If you wanna know, 
I was talking to the vicar.

856
01:45:32.590 --> 01:45:36.862
- Mr Playfair.
- That's strange.


857
01:45:43.971 --> 01:45:46.272
I had a long talk with Father Lonergan.

858
01:46:49.019 --> 01:46:52.390
Woman of the house! 
Where's me tea?

859
01:46:56.195 --> 01:46:57.695
Mary Kate?

860
01:46:57.895 --> 01:47:04.137
(MICHALEEN): Save your breath, boy.
She's gone from you, and small wonder.


861
01:47:04.337 --> 01:47:09.878
- What are you talking about? Where is she?
- She came tappin' at me door as the sun come up.


862
01:47:10.078 --> 01:47:13.350
- "Will you join me to the train", says she.
- Why?


863
01:47:13.584 --> 01:47:18.856
The very question. "Why", says I.
"Because I love him", says she.


864
01:47:19.056 --> 01:47:22.593
"I love him too much to go on livin'
with a man I'm ashamed of."


865
01:47:24.295 --> 01:47:29.001
- What time was this?
- Oh, in time for the Dublin train.


866
01:47:41.986 --> 01:47:44.288
Saddle up my horse, will you, please.

867
01:47:45.421 --> 01:47:47.423
Saddle his horse?

868
01:47:49.828 --> 01:47:53.399
I'll have no part in helpin'
you to put more shame on her.


869
01:47:55.102 --> 01:47:57.337
Saddle his horse...

870
01:48:00.441 --> 01:48:03.879
Dam da dam da, diddle de da...

871
01:48:32.814 --> 01:48:34.382
Well, we're off!

872
01:48:34.583 --> 01:48:39.289
Then, might I suggest,Mr. Costelo, that the train already
is four and a half hours late.


873
01:48:39.489 --> 01:48:42.260
Now, is it my fault,Mr. Bailey?

874
01:48:42.493 --> 01:48:46.699
There's a match at Ballygar,
and the champions of all Ireland...

875
01:48:46.899 --> 01:48:51.505
If you knew your country's history as well as
you claim to know it,Mr. Bailey


876
01:48:51.706 --> 01:48:57.311
you'd know that the Mayo Hurdlers
haven't been beaten west of the Shannon
for the last 22 years.


877
01:48:57.511 --> 01:49:00.716
- True!
- It's a lie!


878
01:50:10.134 --> 01:50:12.770
If this means what I hope it means...

879
01:50:12.970 --> 01:50:17.043
Danaher versus the Yank.
It'll be weeks on the green this time.


880
01:50:25.621 --> 01:50:27.124
Morning.

881
01:50:36.466 --> 01:50:37.969
Good day to you, sirs.

882
01:50:51.621 --> 01:50:55.056
Five minutes, did you say? Right!

883
01:50:56.426 --> 01:51:02.667
- He's walkin' her back, the whole long way!
- It's Homeric, that's what it is, Homeric.


884
01:51:02.867 --> 01:51:06.505
- Post a lookout. They may go home first.
- Where's your pistol?.


885
01:51:06.705 --> 01:51:09.677
- In the same place.
- Excuse me, general.


886
01:51:10.944 --> 01:51:15.951
One by land, two by
sea, and I'll follow the lot.

887
01:51:16.151 --> 01:51:17.753
What a day for Inisfree!

888
01:51:17.953 --> 01:51:23.258
On a day like this I can say only one thing.
Gentlemen, the drinks are on the house!


889
01:51:26.329 --> 01:51:28.299
Well, they are..!...

890
01:51:59.271 --> 01:52:03.410
(WOMAN): Darling, here is your shoe!

891
01:52:07.547 --> 01:52:09.451
Why, you...

892
01:52:13.889 --> 01:52:17.960
It's only five miles. Just a
good stretch of the legs.


893
01:52:23.034 --> 01:52:26.673
- You lost your shoe.
- Thank you very kindly, sir.


894
01:52:51.838 --> 01:52:58.478
(WOMAN): Mr... Mr Sean! Here's
a good stick to beat the lovely lady.


895
01:53:00.012 --> 01:53:01.949
Thanks!

896
01:53:04.219 --> 01:53:06.087
(GUNSHOTS FROM OUTSIDE)

897
01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:07.497
I think your in-laws are comin'
to visit you, Squire Darlin'.


898
01:54:44.512 --> 01:54:49.851
Danaher, you owe me 350 pounds.
Let's have it!


899
01:54:58.995 --> 01:55:01.331
So, the IRA is in this, too, eh?

900
01:55:01.532 --> 01:55:07.006
If it were, Red Will Danaher, not
a scorched stone of your fine house'd be standin'.


901
01:55:07.239 --> 01:55:09.943
A beautiful testiment!

902
01:55:14.048 --> 01:55:16.251
I'll pay you... never!

903
01:55:16.451 --> 01:55:19.688
That breaks all bargains.

904
01:55:21.024 --> 01:55:25.261
(SEAN): You can take your sister back.
It's your custom, not mine.


905
01:55:25.462 --> 01:55:28.999
(SEAN): No fortune, no marriage. 
We call it quits.

906
01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:37.945
You'd do this to me, your own wife?

907
01:55:38.146 --> 01:55:41.015
- After what...
- (SEAN): It's done.


908
01:55:49.792 --> 01:55:52.929
There's your dirty money. Take it.

909
01:55:53.163 --> 01:55:56.468
Count it, you spawn, and look...

910
01:55:56.669 --> 01:56:00.807
If ever I see that face of yours again,
I'll push that through it.


911
01:56:18.328 --> 01:56:20.431
Charge it!

912
01:56:24.068 --> 01:56:28.141
I'll be goin' on home now.
I'll have the supper ready for you.


913
01:57:07.289 --> 01:57:09.494
All right, Will, you asked for it!

914
01:57:22.174 --> 01:57:25.712
Three to one given on Danaher. 
Three to one...

915
01:57:25.912 --> 01:57:30.886
- I'll have some of that. Ten on Thornton.
- Done! Anyone else?


916
01:58:25.254 --> 01:58:29.459
(MICHALEEN): Gentlemen, if you please.
This is a private fight.


917
01:58:29.659 --> 01:58:33.931
The Marquis of Queensbury rules
will be observed on all occasions.


918
01:58:34.130 --> 01:58:36.767
Mind your nose, squire.

919
01:58:37.468 --> 01:58:40.205
Okay with me, Michaleen!

920
01:58:44.178 --> 01:58:45.447
Thanks.

921
01:58:45.647 --> 01:58:49.684
Non-belligerents will kindly remain neutral.

922
01:58:49.884 --> 01:58:53.723
Now, shake hands and come
out fighting. I thank you.

923
01:58:53.924 --> 01:58:57.394
Did you hear that, everybody?
The Marquis of Queensbury rules.


924
01:58:57.627 --> 01:58:59.829
- The Marquis of Queensbury rules.
- Mar..


925
01:59:05.203 --> 01:59:08.274
Come on, get up, 
Marquis of Queensbury.

926
01:59:08.475 --> 01:59:12.913
- I hope that Thornton beats him senseless.
- Mr. Thornton's a married man, Sarah.


927
01:59:13.114 --> 01:59:16.985
Who cares about him? It's that big
bellowing bully concerns me.


928
01:59:17.185 --> 01:59:20.288
"I'm the best man in Inisfree."
Oh, I didn't know that.


929
01:59:25.061 --> 01:59:29.066
Call them and tell them to send reinforcements.
There's a riot here.


930
01:59:45.020 --> 01:59:47.221
Five to one on the big chap, Snuffy.

931
01:59:47.422 --> 01:59:50.860
- Given or taken?
- Given.


932
02:00:04.378 --> 02:00:07.113
- You've had enough?
- No.


933
02:00:12.152 --> 02:00:14.957
Well, give a man a hand, then.

934
02:00:22.467 --> 02:00:24.770
Yes, inspector. 
Thank you, sir.

935
02:00:25.003 --> 02:00:28.108
- What did he say?
- To put five pounds on Danaher's nose.


936
02:00:29.109 --> 02:00:32.880
- Another ten on Thornton!
- Another.


937
02:00:34.314 --> 02:00:39.488
- A pound on Danaher.
- Two pounds on Danaher, please.


938
02:00:39.688 --> 02:00:42.258
Two pounds?

939
02:00:42.658 --> 02:00:46.430
"... hands of a hundred battles,
eye on a thousand besides... "


940
02:00:46.630 --> 02:00:49.901
"... stood alone on the victorious field,
his buckler bent... "


941
02:00:50.102 --> 02:00:53.105
"... his broken sword clutched
in his mighty hand... "

942
02:00:53.305 --> 02:00:59.311
"... the blood of a thousand wounds
oozing from his open veins... "


943
02:00:59.511 --> 02:01:01.881
(NOISE OUTSIDE)

944
02:01:26.113 --> 02:01:29.783
- Father! Father Lonergan!
- Shh, shhh.


945
02:01:30.018 --> 02:01:33.523
- A big fight in the town!
- And there's a big fight in this fish right here.


946
02:01:33.723 --> 02:01:37.327
- I'd put a stop to it but...
- You do that. It's your duty.


947
02:01:37.527 --> 02:01:40.631
But you see, it
was Danaher and Sean Thornton!

948
02:01:40.831 --> 02:01:43.601
- Who?
- Danaher and Sean Thornton.


949
02:01:43.801 --> 02:01:46.304
Why the devil didn't you tell me?!?!

950
02:02:03.694 --> 02:02:07.163
- Shouldn't we put a stop to it?
- We should, lad, we should.


951
02:02:07.363 --> 02:02:10.600
It's our duty, yes, it's our duty.

952
02:02:18.178 --> 02:02:20.882
Come on, come on!

953
02:02:27.857 --> 02:02:31.728
- How's that bettin' going?
- Even money, but don't ruin it.


954
02:02:33.664 --> 02:02:37.801
Well, Danaher, you're a good fight,
I'll say that for you.


955
02:02:38.003 --> 02:02:42.308
When it comes to that, it's been
a pleasure beatin' you.


956
02:02:49.817 --> 02:02:51.387
Thanks.

957
02:02:52.888 --> 02:02:56.793
- Will you take another 20 on Thornton?
- No, the book's closed.


958
02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:02.967
- A pound on Thornton against the squire.
- Go away Ya Traiter!!


959
02:03:05.202 --> 02:03:08.441
- How about a drink?
- The drinks will be on the house.


960
02:03:08.676 --> 02:03:13.647
That's a good idea. The people of Ballyglon are comin'
over by bus, thousands of them.


961
02:03:13.847 --> 02:03:17.686
That's a good idea, not that I'm tired.
I'm as fresh as a daisy.


962
02:03:17.887 --> 02:03:21.157
You look more like a
black-eyed Susan to me. Let's go.

963
02:03:21.624 --> 02:03:25.494
- Is that a public house?
- Yes, your lordship.


964
02:03:25.695 --> 02:03:27.698
- Are they going in?
- Yes, your lordship.


965
02:03:27.898 --> 02:03:33.073
- Does that mean that the fight's over?
- No, that's just the end of round one.


966
02:03:35.774 --> 02:03:37.744
Come, keep away, keep away!

967
02:03:45.453 --> 02:03:51.294
Whiskey? No, that'll be too warm,
it'll get your blood up. Porter is the very thing.


968
02:03:51.527 --> 02:03:55.867
- Ah, it's peaceful and quiet in here, isn't it?
- Yeah.


969
02:03:56.067 --> 02:03:57.770
You know...

970
02:04:00.538 --> 02:04:03.009
This has been a fight I'd
come a long way to see.

971
02:04:03.209 --> 02:04:05.812
I hope you can
stick around for the finish.

972
02:04:07.212 --> 02:04:09.850
Don't worry about that!

973
02:04:13.087 --> 02:04:18.761
- You know, Yank. I've taken quite a likin' to you.
- I'm gettin' real fond of you, too.


974
02:04:19.730 --> 02:04:23.934
Your widow, me sister... She could've done
a lot worse.


975
02:04:24.134 --> 02:04:26.104
- True, true.
- Poor woman.


976
02:04:26.339 --> 02:04:30.008
- Thanks, fill them up again.
- You buy me no drinks.


977
02:04:30.208 --> 02:04:34.680
- The drinks are on the house, sir.
- I'm takin' no drinks from you, squint.


978
02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:38.920
- I'm buyin' the drinks!
- You can buy me a drink at your wake.


979
02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:41.089
And not before.

980
02:04:43.225 --> 02:04:44.929
I'm buyin'!

981
02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:51.770
Bar towel!

982
02:04:55.540 --> 02:04:58.277
- What time is it?
- Half past five, sir.


983
02:05:04.952 --> 02:05:06.221
Lord, he beat you!

984
02:05:16.367 --> 02:05:22.640
Why... I hope you won't be vexed with me,Cyril
but, I've lost three pounds to Mrs Tillane.


985
02:05:22.874 --> 02:05:25.444
I know I shouldn't have bet but...

986
02:05:25.678 --> 02:05:28.448
There you are, 
Snuffy, 15 pounds.

987
02:05:31.118 --> 02:05:34.890
- Hellooo there, Elizabeth.
- Your lordship.


988
02:05:35.090 --> 02:05:40.097
- And what have you been doing all day?
- If you'll excuse me, I'll...


989
02:05:40.297 --> 02:05:43.132
I'll get your tea, Snuffy.

990
02:05:45.503 --> 02:05:49.574
# There was a wild colonial boy

991
02:05:49.774 --> 02:05:52.979
# Jack Duggan was his name

992
02:05:53.179 --> 02:05:57.319
# He was born and bred in Ireland

993
02:05:57.519 --> 02:06:01.290
# In a place called Castlemaine

994
02:06:01.490 --> 02:06:05.428
# He was his father's only son

995
02:06:05.628 --> 02:06:09.133
# His mother's pride and joy

996
02:06:09.333 --> 02:06:13.337
# And dearly did his parents love

997
02:06:13.537 --> 02:06:17.910
# This wild colonial boy

998
02:06:29.358 --> 02:06:33.463
Woman of the house! I brought
the brother home to supper.


999
02:06:34.764 --> 02:06:37.467
He's kindly welcome.

1000
02:06:38.703 --> 02:06:40.672
God bless all in this house.

1001
02:06:40.872 --> 02:06:42.741
- Wipe your feet.
- Thank you, ma'am.


1002
02:06:42.941 --> 02:06:46.547
Sit down, sit down. 
That's what chairs are for.

1003
02:06:51.753 --> 02:06:54.055
Hurry it up!

1004
02:07:01.197 --> 02:07:06.705
Well, then. So peace and quiet came
once again to Inisfree,


1005
02:07:06.905 --> 02:07:10.277
and we were... Good heavens,
what's that woman up to now.?!


1006
02:07:10.477 --> 02:07:13.880
Make way, she'll be runnin'you down with that.!

1007
02:07:23.992 --> 02:07:27.530
When the Reverend Mr Playfair, Good Man
that he is, comes down,


1008
02:07:27.731 --> 02:07:31.336
I want you all to cheer like Protestants.
Now, spread out!


1009
02:07:45.053 --> 02:07:46.954
(CROWD CHEERS)

1010
02:07:47.154 --> 02:07:51.360
Hip, hip, hooray! 
Hip, hip, hooray!

1011
02:08:05.913 --> 02:08:11.951
No patty fingers, if you please.
The proprieties at all times.


1012
02:08:13.821 --> 02:08:16.224
Hold on to your hats. Come on.
