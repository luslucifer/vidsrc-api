00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.750
THE CLASS

2
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.170
Hi.

3
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.040
- Okay, François?
- And you?


4
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.880
Stéphane. François.

5
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.550
- Still on the team?
- As ready as ever.


6
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.390
Hello.

7
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.560
This one?

8
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.360
At the back, please.

9
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.580
Hi, I'm Hervé.

10
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.420
A sports teacher here
for three years.


11
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.210
Welcome to all our new colleagues.

12
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.210
The students can be tough...

13
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.630
...but they're good kids.

14
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.760
Hi, I'm Olivier.
I teach physical science...


15
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.890
...and I've been here for four years.

16
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.770
I'm Patrick...

17
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.480
...and I teach multiplication tables...

18
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.820
...and sometimes mathematics.

19
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.150
I've been at this school
for a number of years.


20
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.410
Hello, I'm Anne.

21
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.410
I used to work in the Lyon suburbs.
I teach English.


22
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.120
I'm looking for my new colleagues.

23
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.960
Hi, I'm Isabelle.

24
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.750
I'm Christiane.

25
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.420
I'm Frédéric,
I teach history and geography...


26
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.930
...and I used to work
out in the suburbs of Paris.


27
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.930
I'm happy to be in the city now.

28
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.310
I'm Julie, the year supervisor.

29
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.100
I'd like to welcome you all
and wish you a good year.


30
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.230
I'm Aline and I'm the cook.

31
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.980
I'd like to welcome you all.

32
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.940
Thank you, Aline.

33
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.280
Hello. I'm Gilles.

34
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.620
I've been teaching mathematics
for many years.


35
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.620
I'm retiring at the end of this year.

36
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.670
I'd like to wish the new arrivals
plenty of courage.


37
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.010
I'm François.

38
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.140
I teach French
and I'm starting my fourth year here.


39
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.310
Welcome, everybody.

40
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.610
We'll all meet up at midday...

41
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.990
...in the canteen for a drink
to mark the new year.


42
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.670
You get Wednesday like you wanted.

43
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.210
We could swap our classes.

44
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.550
Nice, nice.

45
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.260
Not nice, not nice at all.

46
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.890
He's nice.

47
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.060
Not nice, watch him, not nice at all.

48
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.890
Nice, not nice.

49
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.020
She's not nice at all.

50
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.410
Arthur, your cap.

51
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.080
Good morning.

52
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.750
That's my place.

53
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.500
Get lost.

54
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.910
Calm down now.

55
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.790
Stop stirring things up.

56
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.410
Remove your hood, please.

57
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.420
You two back there,
there's a place here.


58
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.880
- One up front.
- There's room here too.


59
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.630
Let's get one thing clear.

60
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.060
We waste five minutes
lining up outside...


61
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.890
...five coming up, five settling down:

62
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.940
Do you realize
what 15 lost minutes means?


63
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.440
With 25 hours a week...

64
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.490
...and 30 weeks in the year,
we lose thousands of minutes.


65
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.490
In other schools, they do a full hour.

66
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.780
Imagine how far ahead
they get in a year.

67
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.990
Figure it out.

68
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.870
We never do an hour.

69
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.830
Hand up to speak.

70
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.500
What?

71
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.500
We never do an hour.
You always say that.


72
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.590
Teachers say we do an hour's class
but we never do.


73
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.350
Eight thirty to 9:25
doesn't make an hour.


74
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.680
All right, it's 55 minutes.

75
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.230
That's an important point.

76
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.520
Stop saying other schools do an hour.

77
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.570
They don't.

78
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.610
All I'm saying is that we waste time.
Like now.


79
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.660
To start with,
take out a sheet of paper...


80
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.370
...fold it in two
so that it can stand...

81
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.250
...on the edge of your desk clearly...

82
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.080
...and, using block capitals...

83
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.790
...write your full name.

84
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.300
Why write our names?

85
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.210
To know who you are.

86
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.880
But you know us.

87
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.470
We had you last year.

88
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.510
Esmeralda,
half of the kids here are new.


89
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.100
Be happy. That way,
people will know your name.


90
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.390
I'm not doing it.

91
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.350
I won't if you don't.

92
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.940
You're right.

93
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.320
For those of you who don't
know me, I'm Mr. Marin.


94
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.990
Ms. Marin.

95
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.860
- A marine?
- Very funny.


96
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.570
Corny.

97
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.660
He wiped you out, sir.

98
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.250
Come on, it shouldn't take so long.

99
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.250
Five minutes to write a name.

100
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.170
It's ridiculous.

101
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.400
A biscuit for the first day?

102
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.950
I'm okay, thanks.

103
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:18.410
Rachel, a biscuit will buck you up.

104
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.500
All right.

105
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.250
"Witty."

106
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.050
That's a word...

107
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.840
...we'll try to explain later.

108
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.130
Are there any other words...

109
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.930
...that you don't understand?

110
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.140
Burak.

111
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:39.520
The word "condescension."

112
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.060
Yes, that's a complicated word.

113
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.150
Do you have any idea...

114
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.440
...what that might mean?

115
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.730
A vague idea but I'm not sure.

116
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.990
You're not sure?

117
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.280
We'll talk about that later then.

118
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.080
Yes, Damien?

119
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.580
"Argentite."

120
00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.500
Argentite. What does that mean?

121
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.460
It's people who live in Argentina.

122
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.340
Right, the inhabitants of Argentina.

123
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.880
Of course not.

124
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.550
Damien, who lives in Argentina?

125
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.380
The Argentites.

126
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.050
In a soccer match...

127
00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.810
...Argentina's players are called...

128
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.850
Footballers.

129
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.310
Let's move on.

130
00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.230
Any other difficult words
in this text?


131
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.770
Henriette?

132
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.990
Is there anything
that you didn't understand?


133
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.580
"Henceforth."

134
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.330
Thanks for the prompt, Samantha.

135
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.180
I think that will do.
Let's take a look at these words.


136
00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.010
All right. "Austrian."

137
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.720
Wei was the one
who picked the word "Austrian."


138
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.140
Yes, Esmeralda.

139
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.690
We all know what "Austrian" is.

140
00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.650
- People from Austria.
- Wei doesn't know and--


141
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.940
Maybe, but everyone else knows.

142
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.570
We get the message.

143
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.570
You didn't know "misleading"...

144
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.990
...so you're not really
in any position to talk.


145
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.990
But everyone knows what "Austrian" means.

146
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.200
Nobody's perfect.

147
00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.460
"Austrian" is not
a very important word, Wei.


148
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.920
It refers to someone
from the land of Austria...


149
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.420
...which is a pretty tiny country.

150
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.550
We can live without the word.

151
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.550
Can anyone name a famous Austrian?

152
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.640
Mozart.

153
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.600
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

154
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.560
- Who?
- Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.


155
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:51.610
Wolfgang maybe
if he were English, not Austrian.


156
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.280
Any other famous Austrians?

157
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.700
Austria could vanish,
no one would notice.


158
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:02.280
Seriously, it's south of Germany.
So check a map, Wei.


159
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.080
You'll see where it is.

160
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.580
Souleymane,
can you note the words too?


161
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.130
I forgot my things.

162
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.130
No one can lend you some paper?

163
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.880
- I'll do it at home.
- You'll do it at home.


164
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.930
Sure you will. 
That's your approach.

165
00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.300
Only work at home.

166
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:21.800
I'm serious.

167
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.810
If I could be sure of that--

168
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.890
Don't worry.

169
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.270
It'll be okay.

170
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.480
Thanks.

171
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.860
Let's move on to "succulent."
"Succulent" is a word...


172
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.070
...that we'll try to guess
the meaning of.


173
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.820
What's in "succulent"?

174
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.030
Suck.

175
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.280
Suck off.

176
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.990
Very funny, Boubacar.

177
00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.580
Very witty indeed.

178
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.960
Here's a sentence...

179
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.710
...with "succulent."

180
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:58.130
Bill enjoys a succulent...

181
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.760
...cheeseburger.

182
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.470
Cheeseburgers stink.

183
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.430
- Who said that?
- Me.


184
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.020
Why a cheeseburger?

185
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.940
Well, since you say they stink...

186
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.190
...you think cheeseburgers
aren't succulent.


187
00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.530
Maybe, but they're crap.

188
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:21.160
Okay, but what I just said
should have made the penny drop.


189
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.490
What does that mean?

190
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.240
- What?
- The penny thing.


191
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.370
To make the penny drop.

192
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.420
No one knows the expression?

193
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.830
If the penny drops,
it means you understand.


194
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.710
When I say...

195
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.340
...if cheeseburgers stink,
they're not succulent...


196
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.890
...that should help you see
what "succulent" means.


197
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:47.140
- What's with the Bills?
- What bills?


198
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.680
The name Bill.

199
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.480
You always use weird names.

200
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:54.980
Weird? A recent U.S. president
was called Bill.


201
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:59.570
Why don't you use Aissata or Rachid
or Ahmed or...?


202
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.650
You always use whitey names.

203
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.120
- What names?
- Honky names.


204
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.080
What's a honky?

205
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.080
Honkies, Frenchies, frogs.

206
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.410
You're not French?

207
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.920
- No, I'm not French.
- I didn't know.


208
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.250
I am, but not proud of it.

209
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.340
Fine, I'm not either.

210
00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:19.710
Wiped him out.

211
00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.220
Why use these names?

212
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:26.260
Khoumba,
if I start choosing names...


213
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:29.220
...to suit all your origins,
it'll never end.


214
00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.930
Just change a little.

215
00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.310
What do you suggest?

216
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.610
Aissata. Fatou.

217
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.570
No, Aissata.

218
00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.140
Excuse me.
You have class 4/3 in French?


219
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.060
I'm class supervisor too.

220
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.900
Know what book you'll be reading?

221
00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.480
No, I haven't decided.

222
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:27.360
In history, I'll start
with the Ancien Régime.


223
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.910
If you want to link into that...

224
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.080
...what kind of books are there?

225
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.790
The Enlightenment will be tough for them.

226
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.960
How about Voltaire? Is he tough?

227
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.010
He's not easy.

228
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.220
Candide is simple.

229
00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.840
Not in their year.

230
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.300
Zadig.

231
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:52.140
Yes, but...

232
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.310
It'd be tough.

233
00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:32.220
- Twenty seconds to go.
- No, sir, please.


234
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.470
We haven't finished.

235
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.560
We can't spend two hours
on the imperfect.


236
00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.570
Dalla, I can give you the time.

237
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.950
Sir, my pen keeps leaking.

238
00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.660
- It's crap.
- Who has a handkerchief?


239
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:53.740
Me.

240
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.490
Rabah.

241
00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.540
Ask before you stand.

242
00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.830
- May I?
- Yes.


243
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:06.300
- Gently, okay.
- The perv.


244
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.720
He touched her tits.

245
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.260
Just give him the handkerchief.

246
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:12.640
Spare us your comments.

247
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.890
Goddamn pedophile.

248
00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.060
- Quiet.
- Sir.


249
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.690
Why the imperfect indicative?

250
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.690
Cut it out.

251
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.530
- Why not just imperfect?
- Quiet, Souleymane.


252
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.700
All right, Esmeralda,
why the indicative?


253
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:38.160
If I knew, I wouldn't ask.

254
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.410
I can imagine.

255
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.330
Anyone know why we specify
the imperfect indicative?


256
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.500
Why not just the imperfect?

257
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.380
- Nassim.
- May I wash my hands?


258
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.180
Go on, wash them
and get it over with.


259
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.640
Make it quick.

260
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.510
He'll take a week.

261
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.520
- I'll go with him.
- Enough.


262
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:05.110
The imperfect indicative is different
than another imperfect.


263
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:07.860
Which imperfect is that?

264
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.030
- Agame?
- The imperfect subjunctive.


265
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.490
Exactly.

266
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.450
The imperfect subjunctive.

267
00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:17.160
Can anyone give me an example?

268
00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.960
I don't believe it, Khoumba,
but go on.


269
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.250
I may be wrong.

270
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.460
- I think so too.
- I were.


271
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:29.880
I were.

272
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.130
From the verb "to were"?

273
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.220
- I don't know.
- I was.


274
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.930
I were, we were, you were.

275
00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.260
All right.

276
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:41.020
Not bad but you use it wrongly.

277
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:45.650
You vaguely recall
the imperfect subjunctive.


278
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.020
Imagine I say:

279
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.150
"He insists that I be...

280
00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.240
...in shape."

281
00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.080
What is "be" in that example?

282
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.080
- Eva?
- The present subjunctive.


283
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.750
Very good.

284
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.920
For the imperfect subjunctive...

285
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.460
...we follow the sequence of tenses
and use a past:


286
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.090
"He insisted."

287
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.840
"He insisted that I..." Khoumba?

288
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.680
Were.

289
00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:21.270
You really think I'll tell my mom:

290
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:24.230
"He insisted
that I were'd been in shape"?


291
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.770
Not "I were'd been."

292
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.690
Learn to use it first.

293
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.440
"That I were in shape."

294
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.490
- The sequence of tenses.
- No one says that.


295
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.950
I was right.

296
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.410
I were.

297
00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.870
Will you let me answer...

298
00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.200
...the question?

299
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:45.000
- If you care.
- You may.


300
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:50.210
Before mastering something,
the imperfect subjunctive...


301
00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.050
...you're telling me it's no use.

302
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:58.050
Start by mastering it, then you
can call its use into question.


303
00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.060
Sir, why are you criticizing us?

304
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:06.770
They're right, that's the way
people talked in the old days.


305
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.650
Even my gran didn't say that.

306
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.730
Or your great granddad.
It's from the Middle Ages.


307
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.530
No, it isn't.

308
00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.240
It is.

309
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.780
It's bourgeois.

310
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:20.820
Tell me, when was the last time...

311
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.790
...you heard someone talk like that?

312
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.460
Yesterday, with friends,
we used the imperfect subjunctive--


313
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.880
No, someone normal.

314
00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.260
All right, all right.

315
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.880
Can I reply?

316
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.680
- Yep.
- I'll talk this over, but calmly.


317
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:47.680
All right,
not everyone talks that way.


318
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.900
In fact, people who do
are pretty rare.


319
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.820
I'd even say only snobs...

320
00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.280
...use the imperfect subjunctive.

321
00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:58.780
What's a snob?

322
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.780
Snobs are slightly affected,
slightly precious people...


323
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.410
...who tend to put on airs.

324
00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:07.790
Homosexuals?

325
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.120
No, not homosexuals.

326
00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:14.130
You can be affected and refined...

327
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.590
...without being homosexual,
Boubacar.


328
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.760
In any case...

329
00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:23.970
...this register may seem
formal and a bit affected...


330
00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.140
...and even bourgeois.

331
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.230
But these different registers exist...

332
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.730
...as I keep telling you...

333
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.110
...you need to be able to use them.

334
00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.940
Familiar, current, formal...

335
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.530
...oral and written.
Move between them...


336
00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.610
...and use them all. Yes, Lucie?

337
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:46.030
How do we know what's for written
and what's for oral?


338
00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:49.710
Why is a word more for one register?

339
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.370
Normally, that's something...

340
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.420
...that you pick up as you go along.

341
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:59.340
You need to use intuition.

342
00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.800
What's "intuition"?

343
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.140
Intuition is when you
can't use thinking.


344
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.350
When you can't really...

345
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.980
It's not knowing...

346
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.270
...but more like sensing something.

347
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.980
When you sense things.

348
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.190
What if you don't sense?

349
00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.450
If you don't sense them, well...

350
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.360
You gain intuition
by using the language.


351
00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.160
That's when you learn
to distinguish...


352
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.410
...almost automatically
between oral and written styles.


353
00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.960
- Souleymane wants to say something.
- Shut it.


354
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.540
What does he want to say?

355
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:40.760
- Go on.
- Calm down.


356
00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.220
If he says, you'll tell.

357
00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.220
Cut it out. No fighting.

358
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:47.890
- I'll whoop you.
- Don't act tough.


359
00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.140
What's wrong?

360
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:51.680
Boubacar, turn round.

361
00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.770
- What is it?
- Nothing.


362
00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.820
- Apparently not.
- Don't send him to the principal.


363
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.400
If I tell you,
I'm good for Guantánamo.


364
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:06.700
I'll be tased.

365
00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:07.990
You won't be tased.

366
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.740
You have a question?

367
00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:12.370
- Yep.
- So ask it.


368
00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.080
- It's too wicked.
- It's not.


369
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.710
It's the pits for you.

370
00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.920
- Just ask it.
- I have your word?


371
00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:19.380
Hurry up.

372
00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:23.420
This is what I heard, okay?
I didn't say it but I heard.


373
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.800
People say you like men.

374
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.730
- I didn't say it.
- Who says that?


375
00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.770
Just people.

376
00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:38.860
They say Mr. Marin likes men.

377
00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.980
Others say that, not you?

378
00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:43.780
- You're not interested?
- No way.


379
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:46.360
- So why do you ask?
- For the others.


380
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:47.990
I'm a spokesman.

381
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.240
- But you don't care?
- If you like men, fine.


382
00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.580
Exactly.

383
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.910
- So is it true?
- You are asking me.


384
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.670
Homosexual isn't an insult, sir.

385
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.420
You say it isn't
but it seems to be a problem for you.


386
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:06.090
You find it odd, men liking men.

387
00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.100
Maybe it is, I don't know.
Is it true or not?


388
00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.680
No, it's not. Feel better now?

389
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.850
Yeah? Sure.

390
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.060
Sorry to disappoint you.

391
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.190
All right, if Souleymane
doesn't mind...


392
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.320
...now he's settled his hang-ups...

393
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.410
...let's get back
to the imperfect indicative.


394
00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:40.170
Yeah, like that. Not bad.

395
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.460
What are you doing?

396
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.170
- What's up?
- Get lost.


397
00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:52.720
Who asked you? 
Look at your mug.

398
00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:54.680
It's fucking okay.

399
00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:57.140
Take these jerks, then we'll see.

400
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:59.230
Go on, show me your backs.

401
00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:00.940
These guys suck.

402
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.400
Another one.

403
00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.980
- Classy display.
- You bet.


404
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:07.820
- Got one for me?
- Can't afford it.


405
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.650
- How much?
- Too much.


406
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.620
Stop thinking I'm broke like you.

407
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.000
She screwed up there.
She thinks it's a regular verb.


408
00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.420
No, the verb's "swim." Swimmed.

409
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:34.050
Justine.

410
00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:35.560
Swimmed.

411
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.810
Justine, work it out yourself.

412
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:44.770
Swummed. That's better,
it mixes the two.


413
00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.780
Swammed.

414
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.740
She put "swemmed."

415
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:57.620
Okay, thank you.

416
00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:59.660
Try "swommed."

417
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.250
You can sit down.

418
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.500
Let's see.

419
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:08.000
She can't write.

420
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.050
She can't write? Can you, Rabah?

421
00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.930
- You bet.
- Go on then.


422
00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:14.850
Conjugate it properly.

423
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.100
First, swimmed.

424
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:21.430
Carry on.

425
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.440
Cut it out.

426
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.360
Swammed.

427
00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.690
Wrong again.

428
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.320
Just kidding.

429
00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.620
- It's not like that.
- So, what is it?


430
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.160
S
- W...

431
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.040
Without an "I."

432
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.870
Right, no "I."

433
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:45.670
Why make fun of Justine...

434
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.630
...when you can't do better?

435
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.840
I can.

436
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:52.170
Justine wasn't so wrong.

437
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:55.140
That's enough.

438
00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.180
You can't focus
for more than 20 seconds...


439
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:03.690
...like 3-year-olds.

440
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:07.560
People aged 14 or 15
like you're supposed to be...


441
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.770
...if I ask a question...

442
00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.280
...they should know.

443
00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.950
Your kidding around goes too far.

444
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.570
- Not at all.
- Everyone thinks so.


445
00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:17.780
Dead right.

446
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:21.040
Everyone thinks so,
or only you think so?


447
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.000
No, everyone.

448
00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.580
I think you push it.

449
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:30.420
If I cut you some slack,
you'll never get anywhere.


450
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.670
You go too far.

451
00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.670
And you know why.

452
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.480
I'm sick of these clowns.
Sick of them.


453
00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.100
I can't take any more.

454
00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.860
They're nothing, they know nothing...

455
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:53.230
...they look right through you
when you try to teach them.


456
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:57.450
They can stay in their shit.
I'm not going to help them.


457
00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:01.790
They're so basic, so insincere...

458
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:03.870
...always looking for trouble.

459
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.620
Go ahead, guys.

460
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.960
Stay in your crap neighborhood.

461
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.290
You'll be here all your lives
and it serves you right.


462
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.010
I'll see the principal...

463
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.340
...and tell him I'm not working
with 3/2 again.


464
00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:21.430
No more technology
for the rest of the year. Too bad.


465
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:26.310
It's been three months now
and they haven't done a single thing.


466
00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.690
Have you seen them in the yard?

467
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:30.520
It's like they're in heat.

468
00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:33.070
They're all over each other
like animals.


469
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.650
It's crazy. It's the same in class.

470
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.240
Kevin spent a whole hour going...

471
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:44.290
I've never seen the like of it
in five years.


472
00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.080
Enough.

473
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:51.630
No more.

474
00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.250
We're not animals.

475
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:02.350
Sorry, I'm...

476
00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.520
It's dumb.

477
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:13.770
Come on.

478
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:15.820
Let's get some air.

479
00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.620
One extract isn't a lot to read.

480
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:28.660
No one did it?

481
00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:33.500
We're wasting time here.

482
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.300
Let's read it again then.

483
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:38.840
Who wants to read?

484
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:45.600
Great.
Excellent work atmosphere today.


485
00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:47.520
Khoumba, go on.

486
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.640
No way.

487
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:51.980
You won't read?

488
00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:54.110
I don't want to.

489
00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.030
The class revolves
around your desires?


490
00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.450
- I don't want to read.
- I don't care.


491
00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.320
What did Khoumba just do?

492
00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:06.830
Sneer.

493
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:09.830
I meant her attitude.
What did she show?


494
00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.210
Insolence.

495
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.210
That's right, you're an expert.

496
00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:22.380
You're all angrulo with me.
What is this?


497
00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:24.050
That's not true.

498
00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.180
Try saying it in French. What am I?

499
00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:28.970
"Angrulo."

500
00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.890
Say it in everyday French.

501
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.190
You've got it in for me.

502
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:35.230
That's normal French.

503
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:39.570
I just want you to read.

504
00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.820
I have the right
to ask you to read, don't I?


505
00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:44.610
Don't you think so?

506
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:49.370
No one has read it
and you're picking on me.


507
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.580
I'm not. I want to work...

508
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:55.080
...and I've chosen you
as I have the right to.


509
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:56.540
Drop it.

510
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:58.130
Start reading.

511
00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.750
I won't read.

512
00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:03.760
You tell me to shut up, then to read.
What is this?


513
00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:05.220
What's what?

514
00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:08.260
Make your mind up. 
Think it through.

515
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:10.970
We'll talk it over after class.

516
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:12.930
- It won't be fun.
- Sure.


517
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.650
You won't say that later.

518
00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:18.900
Esmeralda, are you on strike too...

519
00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.780
...or can you read for us?

520
00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.570
It's her life.

521
00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:25.450
In that case, will you read for us?

522
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:27.870
I'd be delighted to.

523
00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:29.910
All right, we're listening.

524
00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.240
"Dear Kitty...

525
00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.540
...I'm known
as a bundle of contradictions.


526
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:39.960
As I've told you several times,
my soul is split in two.


527
00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.050
On one side,
my exuberant cheerfulness...


528
00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:46.720
...my mocking approach to everything,
my joy in life...


529
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:50.220
...and my ability to take things lightly.

530
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:53.640
By that, I mean not seeing...

531
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:55.310
...any wrong in flirting...

532
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.270
...giving a kiss,
embracing someone...


533
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.730
...or telling a tasteless joke.

534
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:05.450
That side lies in wait,
pushing back the other side...


535
00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:08.950
...which is more beautiful,
purer and deeper.


536
00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:13.910
The truth is that no one knows
Anne's better side...


537
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.040
...and that's why most people...

538
00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:17.500
...can't stand me.

539
00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:21.840
I can be an amusing clown
for an afternoon...


540
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.130
...but then everyone
has had enough of me.


541
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.510
So the nice Anne has never once...

542
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.470
...been seen in company.

543
00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.980
But, in her loneliness,
she always triumphs.


544
00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.020
My best to you. Anne Frank.
Anne's diary ends here."


545
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:40.770
It ends here. Why?

546
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.650
Because the police turned up
at the rooms...


547
00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.610
...where they were hiding
and deported them.


548
00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.490
She died shortly after.

549
00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.030
That's what I asked earlier.
We talked about it.


550
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.790
I learn about Anne Frank...

551
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.670
...because she talks about herself
and so I get to know her.


552
00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:04.380
When I ask you to write
your own self-portraits...


553
00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:06.340
...I'll expect the same.

554
00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:10.390
In other words, to learn things
through your feelings.


555
00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:12.680
You can talk about facts...

556
00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:17.770
...that will allow me
to know you better.


557
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:20.270
Yes, Lucie?

558
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:25.320
What we write
won't be as gripping as...


559
00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:27.820
...as what Anne Frank wrote.

560
00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.820
Our lives aren't as gripping.

561
00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.410
All right.

562
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.830
Juliette?

563
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.830
Someone aged 70
could talk about their life...


564
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.420
...but we have nothing to tell at 13.

565
00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:48.460
At 14, 15 or even 13,
you've had experiences.


566
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.340
Less than someone aged 70.
They've lived a lot more.


567
00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.810
- Okay.
- They've seen life.


568
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:59.890
It's funny. You don't think
your lives are interesting.


569
00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.770
We just come to school, go home,
eat and sleep.


570
00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:07.440
You come to school, eat, sleep.
Fine.


571
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:10.400
The bare facts of your life are dull.

572
00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:14.570
- But what you feel is interesting.
- That's my business.


573
00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.200
Maybe, but I'm interested.

574
00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:19.080
That's different.

575
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:20.660
Why is it different?

576
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.000
Because you're a teacher.

577
00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:26.540
It's not the teacher talking.

578
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:29.090
- It's your job.
- It's the human being.


579
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:35.390
I think you're only saying that
to get us to talk and stuff...


580
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.850
...but it's not true.

581
00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:39.520
It isn't?

582
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.810
What isn't true?

583
00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:44.480
The fact that you're interested
in knowing all that.


584
00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.650
So I'm not interested at all...

585
00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.150
...and I'm pushing at this...

586
00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.570
...to convince you it's interesting?

587
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.280
Not as much as you say.

588
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:57.490
Maybe I am exaggerating a little.

589
00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:02.040
It's only natural
since you don't agree with me.


590
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:04.670
But, deep down, 
I'm totally sincere.

591
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:08.630
Why is it such a problem for you...

592
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.130
...to talk about your lives?

593
00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.340
Boubacar?

594
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.510
Well, there's stuff...

595
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.470
There's private stuff.

596
00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:18.850
Of course.

597
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:23.020
What could be hard to say
about your private lives?


598
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:25.190
Burak?

599
00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:28.440
We may be ashamed
to say certain things.


600
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.780
Yes, it has to do with shame.

601
00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:35.450
Things you find it hard to say
and even harder to write.


602
00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:40.030
In your life,
when were you ashamed?


603
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.370
You can be ashamed of a pal's mom.

604
00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.870
Why? Because you find her ugly?

605
00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.590
No. For instance, Rabah's mom.

606
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.010
She offered me lunch but I refused...

607
00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:56.090
...because I was ashamed.

608
00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.760
Ashamed to eat with her?

609
00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:00.680
Because it's beneath you?

610
00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:03.850
I don't understand. Tell me why.

611
00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:08.020
I'm ashamed to eat with her
because I respect her.


612
00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:11.480
You never eat
with people you respect?


613
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:14.570
I mean, she's not my girlfriend.

614
00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:19.740
You can only eat
with a girlfriend?


615
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.370
Tell me why. I'm interested.

616
00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:26.750
I can't explain it.
In any case, I'm ashamed.


617
00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.330
I always hang out with Rabah...

618
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.920
...so I respect his mom.

619
00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:33.710
I don't eat in front of her.

620
00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:38.340
So if Boubacar eats in front of us,
he doesn't respect us.


621
00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:40.600
No, it's not that.

622
00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:44.100
You can't understand.

623
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:45.930
I'm not smart enough?

624
00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.270
You just can't understand.

625
00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:52.610
- Rabah?
- I was at a party with Camemberters.


626
00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:54.400
"Camemberters?"

627
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:55.690
Yeah, like you.

628
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:56.990
What's a Camemberter?

629
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:59.610
Someone who stinks of cheese.

630
00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.950
So the people at the party
stank of cheese?


631
00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.580
They were all in suits and ties.

632
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:09.790
I was in my baggies
and got these weird looks.


633
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.580
- You were ashamed?
- Yeah.


634
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:13.290
Because of the looks.

635
00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:16.010
They were embarrassed
because of you...


636
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:17.970
...and you felt the same.

637
00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:19.590
They weren't embarrassed.

638
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.890
They looked at me
like I was an E.T.

639
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:24.390
You are an E.T.

640
00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.310
"Why's that Arab here?"

641
00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.350
Okay, so it was a race thing.

642
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.890
I don't know.

643
00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.610
But the snacks
were bacon-flavored.


644
00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.070
So?

645
00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.320
So I abstained.

646
00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:42.950
Right. Bacon, ham. Okay, I get it.

647
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:44.780
Wei?

648
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:48.000
Young people now have no shame.

649
00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.290
Young people now? Like you?

650
00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:52.960
Drop your briefs.

651
00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:54.630
They have no shame.

652
00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.710
It's normal. Always normal.

653
00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.550
- Are you like them?
- No, I'm not.


654
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.840
Are you ashamed?

655
00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:03.970
Yes, ashamed for them.

656
00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.480
I'll waste your ugly mug.

657
00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:14.020
Anyone can speak
but you stay polite, okay.


658
00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.440
So why are you ashamed for them?

659
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:19.150
They have no shame.

660
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.110
They yell, they hit each other.

661
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.660
They make jokes, bother others.
No shame.


662
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.950
Wei, aren't you confusing...

663
00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.660
...shame and discipline?

664
00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:32.210
You find the others...

665
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.080
...rowdy and impolite?

666
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:38.420
- It can be shameful too.
- Louise?


667
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:41.220
You can be ashamed
of your appearance.


668
00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.180
Absolutely.

669
00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:45.970
Tell me, Louise...

670
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.720
...what are you ashamed of?

671
00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:53.770
My ears.

672
00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.310
Your ears?

673
00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.560
Can we see?

674
00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:58.650
You're ashamed of your ears?

675
00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.400
What's wrong with them?

676
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:03.360
They stick out.

677
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:05.950
- You think they stick out.
- Mine too.


678
00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.080
I think that covers it all.

679
00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.700
You have all you need
to figure it out.


680
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.580
Take out your exercise books.

681
00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:20.630
Note the following exercise
for next Thursday.


682
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:28.390
It's very simple:
"Write your self-portrait."


683
00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:36.600
A self-portrait isn't
an autobiography.


684
00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:39.440
I don't want your life story.

685
00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.530
Describe yourself
and your personality.


686
00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.910
We'll read them in class
and see how we can use them.


687
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:50.990
Don't forget.

688
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:01.800
Khoumba.

689
00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:04.260
You know I want to see you.

690
00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.100
Give me your report book.

691
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:13.310
Why?

692
00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.310
You know why.

693
00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:25.490
No, give it to me. Politely.
That's enough now.


694
00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:29.120
Put your photo on it.

695
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.670
Is it normal to refuse to read
when a teacher asks you to?


696
00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:41.840
- Is that normal?
- There's others in the class.


697
00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:44.630
I can't turn a blind eye to this.

698
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.970
Can I?

699
00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.600
What happened this summer?

700
00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.810
What happened during the vacation?

701
00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.690
- I didn't see you.
- I know.


702
00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:02.110
I'm intrigued.
At the end of the year in June...


703
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:04.730
...we'd gotten on pretty well together.

704
00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.570
You participated in class.
Since September...


705
00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.990
...since the start of this year...

706
00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:12.200
...you're not cooperative...

707
00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.370
...you keep sulking...

708
00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.870
...you refuse to read.
What happened?


709
00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.210
I don't like reading now.
Can you hurry, please?


710
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:22.210
No, I won't hurry.

711
00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:33.300
Explain. Why have things changed
all of a sudden?


712
00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:36.060
I can't stay a kid forever.

713
00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.560
So it's a kid thing to cooperate?

714
00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:41.190
That's it.

715
00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:42.980
There's others in the class.

716
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:45.230
Of course, when you work, it's...

717
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.530
I haven't finished.

718
00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.400
My mom's waiting for me.

719
00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:52.530
I want an apology first.

720
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:55.240
An apology for what you did.

721
00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.580
"I apologize for being insolent, sir."

722
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:00.040
Sorry. Okay?

723
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:02.210
No, not "sorry."

724
00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.420
"I apologize for being insolent."

725
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:05.840
Go ahead.

726
00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.380
I apologize, sir...

727
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:12.430
No, "I apologize for being insolent."

728
00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:15.220
Be sincere. I want a real apology.

729
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:17.350
Can you hurry up, please?

730
00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.810
- My mom's waiting--
- For your apology.


731
00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:21.350
Let's deal with this.

732
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.440
I want a sincere apology...

733
00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:26.570
...that'll stand
for the rest of the year.


734
00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.780
We won't go on like this.

735
00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:32.450
I apologize for being insolent.

736
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:34.950
More conviction.

737
00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:39.450
- I'm not saying it 50 times.
- You two.


738
00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:40.750
What are you up to?

739
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:42.040
We're waiting.

740
00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:43.250
May I?

741
00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:45.130
Hurry, I'm listening.

742
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:49.630
I apologize for being insolent.
May I go now, please?


743
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:57.970
Cut it out.

744
00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.970
I didn't mean it.

745
00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:15.450
Two weeks ago, at the last meeting...

746
00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:17.320
...the teachers suggested...

747
00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:22.160
...introducing a penalty-point system
for the students...


748
00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:25.120
...based on the driving-license
system.


749
00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:28.460
If students broke a rule...

750
00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.130
...they would lose points.

751
00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.510
As it's the teachers' idea,
I'll let them speak.


752
00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.640
Since last September...

753
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:41.930
...we've noticed an increase
in problems within the school.


754
00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.440
Punishment has no effect
on the students.


755
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:46.980
So we had the idea...

756
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:48.690
...of a penalty system.

757
00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:53.360
The students would have,
for example, six points each...


758
00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:57.870
...and, depending on the misdeed,
they'd lose one or two points.


759
00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:00.450
And when they run out of points?

760
00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:03.660
They go before
the disciplinary committee.


761
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.330
As a parents' representative...

762
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:10.840
...this is typical
of the school's bad habits.


763
00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:14.720
You always condemn the students...

764
00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:16.720
...but never praise them.

765
00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:18.890
They earn praise on their own.

766
00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:23.060
They do it with their grades,
by moving up a class...


767
00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.730
...and we do it in staff meetings...

768
00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:28.440
...by encouraging them to work.

769
00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:32.780
There's the honor roll,
the congratulations...


770
00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:34.530
That all counts.

771
00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:36.360
In your system...

772
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:39.070
...you take away points
for misdeeds...


773
00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:40.910
...but why not go further...

774
00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.240
...and give points to those
who do good things?


775
00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:46.040
Like gold stars.

776
00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.250
I'm all for praising the students...

777
00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:53.630
...but if students collect points
and end up with 34 points, say...


778
00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.630
...that leaves room
for all kinds of trouble...


779
00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.050
...we can't control.

780
00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:03.260
Without going as far
as these imaginary 34 points...


781
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:06.680
...six points to start with...

782
00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:10.150
...means they can cause trouble
without punishment.


783
00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:14.530
Losing a point or two
isn't a real punishment.


784
00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:18.240
It can create
a dangerous sense of impunity.


785
00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:21.620
For me, the idea's
totally wrongheaded.


786
00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.370
In that case...

787
00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.080
...we could find a punishment...

788
00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:30.620
...where the students
lose all their points in one go.


789
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:34.800
But why bother with the points
in that case?


790
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.590
It's tricky.

791
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:42.050
What you call a sense of impunity
gives us room to maneuver.


792
00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:45.640
When you're dealing
with punishments...


793
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:48.270
...that are cut and dried...

794
00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.230
...you can't adapt them to each case.

795
00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.310
I don't agree.

796
00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:57.610
The rules apply in the same way
to all the students.


797
00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.490
They break them, they're punished.

798
00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:02.320
If not, why bother with rules?

799
00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:07.160
Dealing with extremely strict rules
creates the greatest tension.


800
00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:08.700
Take cell phones.

801
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:10.500
We agreed on a rule...

802
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:14.170
...that cell phones
were not allowed in class.


803
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:16.920
Sorry, but I break that rule...

804
00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.470
...because it wasn't a problem
for me.


805
00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:22.840
There's room to be tolerant.

806
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:24.930
The reign of the arbitrary.

807
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:28.060
No, the law and
the spirit of the law.

808
00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:31.310
We could talk all night
but it's not possible.


809
00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:34.480
We have other topics to tackle.

810
00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:39.150
In particular, one vital issue...

811
00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:44.200
...a very sensitive one,
concerning the staff coffee machine.


812
00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.160
It's a sensitive issue, all right.

813
00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:52.370
There's a real problem this year.

814
00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:57.500
The price of a coffee has gone up
from 40 centimes...


815
00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.630
...to 50 centimes.

816
00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:03.510
That may seem petty
but with several coffees a day...


817
00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:07.050
...at 8, at 10 or
at 4 in the afternoon...

818
00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.640
...it works out at a lot.

819
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:15.560
So we've clubbed together
to buy a coffeemaker.


820
00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:19.940
That way, we can drink
as much coffee as we want...


821
00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:22.690
...without having to count.

822
00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:27.410
Mr. Pierre will be delighted to reply.

823
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.330
First of all, this machine
was installed in 2001...


824
00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.250
...to replace a machine...

825
00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:40.380
...that needed the intervention of an
outside company for restocking...


826
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:42.380
...repairs, et cetera.

827
00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:45.880
It was very expensive
and not at all profitable.


828
00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:50.390
We switched to the new machine
which isn't profitable yet.


829
00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:52.600
I'm sorry to hear that.

830
00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:54.560
And so we increased...

831
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:58.940
...the price of coffee by 10 centimes.

832
00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:02.230
The thing has to be
economically viable.


833
00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.280
Nobody's shocked?

834
00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:06.410
It's clear and logical to me.

835
00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:34.350
Good evening.

836
00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:36.140
Don't move.

837
00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:39.100
We have to go. 
We haven't finished.

838
00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:55.950
Respect.

839
00:47:57.330 --> 00:48:00.460
Adolescents
learn to respect their teachers...


840
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:02.340
...because of threats...

841
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.960
...or the fear of having problems.

842
00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:07.880
For starters, I respect you...

843
00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:10.090
...and respect must be mutual.

844
00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:14.180
For instance,
I don't say you're hysterical...


845
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:16.350
...so why do you say I am?

846
00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:20.560
I've always respected you...

847
00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:23.980
...so I don't understand
why I have to write this.


848
00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:30.700
I know you have it in for me
but I don't know why.


849
00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:35.290
I shall sit at the back...

850
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.500
...to avoid any other conflicts...

851
00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:40.330
...unless you come looking for them.

852
00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:43.210
I admit I can be insolent...

853
00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:45.710
...but only if provoked.

854
00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.800
I won't look at you again...

855
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:52.010
...so you can't say
my look is insolent.


856
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:54.300
In theory, in a French class...

857
00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.980
...you talk about French,
not your grandma, your sister...


858
00:48:58.140 --> 00:48:59.770
...or girls' periods.

859
00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:04.730
And so, from now on,
I won't speak to you again.


860
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.780
Signed Khoumba.

861
00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:09.240
- What's up?
- It's a secret.


862
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:10.530
A secret?

863
00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:13.870
It won't stay a secret for long.

864
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:22.080
Why have you changed places?

865
00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:23.750
No reason.

866
00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:25.170
I felt like it.

867
00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.840
- A problem?
- No, not at all.


868
00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.340
No problem.

869
00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:33.590
I wanted a change of scene.

870
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:42.940
Okay, that's enough.

871
00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:44.350
Let's get to work.

872
00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.900
No, sir, please.

873
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:48.230
Please, sir.

874
00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:51.400
You're just copying
what you did at home.


875
00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:53.950
You've had plenty of time.

876
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:56.990
Esmeralda.

877
00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.200
I have to?

878
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:02.370
Yes, absolutely.

879
00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:09.050
My name is Esmeralda Ouertani, I'm 14.

880
00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:11.880
I live on Allée du Pere Dhuit...

881
00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:13.130
...Paris 20...

882
00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:17.140
...with my two parents
and my three brothers and sisters.


883
00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:20.390
Later, I'd like to be a policewoman...

884
00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:24.270
...because people say
all policemen are bad...


885
00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.440
...and so we need good ones.

886
00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:29.320
If not, I'd like to be a rapper...

887
00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:32.570
...and I'm a fan of Bakar...

888
00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:36.160
...Médine, Younes,
Marvin and Mafiak'1 Fry.


889
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:40.790
Otherwise, I like eating, sleeping
and hanging out in the 'hood.


890
00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:42.620
Or rather?

891
00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.460
The neighborhood.

892
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.880
You can say it right.

893
00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:50.170
When you write,
you use the standard style.


894
00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:52.170
Don't make me correct you.

895
00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:54.630
Wei, go on.

896
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:59.640
My name's Wei, 
I'm Chinese...

897
00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:03.480
...I'm 15, I have two sisters,
I'm the youngest.


898
00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:07.770
My hobby is playing video games,
at least four hours a day.


899
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:12.690
I find it hard using French correctly.

900
00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:17.450
It's so hard expressing myself
that others don't understand me.


901
00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:20.240
That's why I don't
communicate much.


902
00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:25.870
I hardly ever go out.
Nothing much interests me outside.


903
00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:31.040
The environment doesn't suit me
here since I'm allergic...


904
00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:33.000
...but I don't know what.

905
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:36.220
Allergic to yourself, that's what.

906
00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:37.930
That's good, Wei.

907
00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:40.800
I feel that I know you better...

908
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:44.560
...after hearing your self-portrait.
That's the goal.


909
00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:47.810
- To tell us things.
- It had to be him.


910
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:51.020
His just happens to be good,
not ours.


911
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:53.070
No, not at all.

912
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:55.190
I can congratulate Wei...

913
00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:00.700
...and I'd gladly congratulate you
if you managed to do it well.


914
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:02.080
Rabah, read us...

915
00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.660
- ...your self-portrait.
- No.


916
00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:06.410
How can I congratulate you
if you don't?


917
00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:07.870
I don't need that.

918
00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.170
Make your mind up.

919
00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:11.500
We're listening.

920
00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:14.420
My name's Rabah, I'm 14...

921
00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:16.210
...I listen to rap.

922
00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:20.220
I love my village in Kabylia
and go there every year.


923
00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:23.930
I like music, rap and slam.

924
00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.930
I have two brothers
but I don't like school.


925
00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:28.890
I don't like tramps.

926
00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:30.230
I like Zidane...

927
00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:33.730
...I like to talk
and I like Psy 4 de la Rime's videos.


928
00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:35.150
Go Marseille.

929
00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:39.110
- We can manage without Marseille.
- Go Paris.


930
00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:41.660
We don't need it in a self-portrait.

931
00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:43.450
He skipped two lines.

932
00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:44.660
That's all.

933
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:47.370
Cut it out.

934
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:49.120
Go, dude.

935
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.960
"I like to make love."

936
00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:53.790
I never wrote that.

937
00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.630
"I like to look good
for the women...


938
00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.130
...and I like summer...

939
00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:00.090
...to see girls' cleavage."

940
00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:04.100
Why not, Rabah?

941
00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.260
I never wrote that.

942
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:09.350
It looks like your writing.

943
00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:11.390
No way.

944
00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:14.270
There's no shame in liking cleavage.

945
00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:17.980
It's not a sin.

946
00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:22.450
Souleymane, stop rocking
and read your self-portrait.


947
00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:23.990
I'm curious.

948
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:26.580
No, not huh.

949
00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:28.500
I wrote nothing.

950
00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:30.330
I saw you writing earlier.

951
00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.460
- No, I wrote nothing.
- You did.


952
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:35.040
- Nothing.
- We're listening.


953
00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:38.420
I'm Souleymane.

954
00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:42.430
I have nothing to say about me
because no one knows me but me.


955
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:46.640
All right.

956
00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:49.060
That's good. A bit long maybe.

957
00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.360
You can't make the effort
that the others did?


958
00:53:57.690 --> 00:53:59.320
I don't talk about myself.

959
00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:01.860
How come the others do?

960
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:05.870
That's their problem.
I don't talk about my life.


961
00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:09.160
He just can't write, that's all.

962
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:10.700
What's up, you cop?

963
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:12.660
You talking to me, cop?

964
00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:15.710
- I can live with it.
- Enough.


965
00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:18.340
Arrest guys instead of talking to me.

966
00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:19.550
Got your cuffs?

967
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:22.720
- Chill.
- Your breath stinks.


968
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:25.390
- Chill.
- Heard of Aquafresh?


969
00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:28.930
Souleymane,
there's no need to be offensive.


970
00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.220
Need a toothbrush?

971
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:37.440
You're a lot better at oral insults
than writing.


972
00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:39.980
He can't even write his name.

973
00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.610
Zip it. What does this say?

974
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:44.320
Spare us your Koran.

975
00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:46.870
Shut it. What's wrong
with the Koran?


976
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:49.580
- I'll spare you when you calm down.
- Calm down.


977
00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:51.580
- It's the Koran.
- Bullshit.


978
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:55.330
What's that tattoo, Souleymane?

979
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.960
Why are you showing it?

980
00:54:57.130 --> 00:54:59.000
He claims it's Koran.

981
00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:03.550
What is it? Why are you showing us?

982
00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:05.880
It means shut your mouth.

983
00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:08.640
It doesn't mean that.

984
00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:12.270
So give us the real translation.
Go on, tell us.


985
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:13.600
I don't want to.

986
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:17.190
You show it in
my class so tell us.

987
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:21.730
It says here, right here:

988
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:25.990
"If your words are less important
than silence, keep quiet."


989
00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.200
What I said.

990
00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:28.450
I said that.

991
00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:31.080
It's not what you said.

992
00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:35.620
Why isn't it the same?

993
00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:38.540
It's different. 
I think it sounds better.

994
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:40.290
Yes, it's better put.

995
00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:45.130
If only you could write
such interesting things on paper...


996
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.800
...that would be great.

997
00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:48.470
I think so too.

998
00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.720
That proves you can do it.

999
00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:55.270
After these first few self-portraits,
I'd like you...


1000
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:57.980
...to rewrite them and polish them...

1001
00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:02.650
...making sure you answer
the questions that we listed:


1002
00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:04.940
What I like and don't like...

1003
00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:07.610
...my qualities and flaws,
who I'd like to be...


1004
00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:09.820
Come in.

1005
00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:16.000
Stand up, please. Good morning.

1006
00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:20.670
That goes for those at the back too.
Come on, stand up.


1007
00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:25.840
Chérif, you heard me?
Everyone has to stand.


1008
00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:29.760
It's a way of greeting an adult.

1009
00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:32.680
It doesn't mean
submission or humiliation.


1010
00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:34.470
Good. Sit back down.

1011
00:56:36.350 --> 00:56:39.940
I've come to introduce
a new student.


1012
00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:44.480
Carl.
Try to make him welcome...


1013
00:56:44.650 --> 00:56:47.190
...until the end of the year.

1014
00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:49.530
Thank you.

1015
00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:56.490
Carl, go sit in the third row,
in that free place.


1016
00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:58.080
Khoumba, move your things.

1017
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.170
Take a sheet of paper and a pen
and try to catch up with the others.


1018
00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:08.630
We'll talk after.

1019
00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:15.810
Don't forget the homework
for Monday without fail.


1020
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:18.220
Let's finish with this.

1021
00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:19.890
Goodbye.

1022
00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:22.900
Carl, stay here a minute or two.

1023
00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:34.450
Welcome.

1024
00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:38.080
I don't know if you know
but I'm Mr. Marin...


1025
00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:40.040
...your class supervisor.

1026
00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:42.830
If there's a problem, tell me.

1027
00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:47.920
I know who you are,
why you're here.


1028
00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:51.760
The principal told me
but that doesn't matter.


1029
00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:54.550
We'll start from scratch here.

1030
00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.430
It will all go well.

1031
00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:00.020
You've seen that we...

1032
00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:04.020
We're on self-portraits
to be handed in next Monday.


1033
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:07.360
Maybe you could do one too.

1034
00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:09.150
Know when the next class is?

1035
00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:13.570
Monday, at 9:30.

1036
00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:14.780
Good.

1037
00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.290
You like French?

1038
00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:22.460
Like everyone, I guess.

1039
00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:28.250
That doesn't mean much.
Okay, off you go.


1040
00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:36.090
You know what a self-portrait is?

1041
00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:38.720
You're sure?

1042
00:58:39.970 --> 00:58:41.270
Have a good day.

1043
00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:55.450
Pleased to meet you.

1044
00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:58.240
Sit down, please.

1045
00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:02.000
Thank you for coming.

1046
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:04.000
I know it isn't easy.

1047
00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:07.960
We're very pleased with Wei.

1048
00:59:08.130 --> 00:59:12.590
Very pleased. All the teachers
at the staff meeting said so.


1049
00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.260
He's kind, he's pleasant.

1050
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:17.840
It's good to have him in class.

1051
00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:22.140
And it's showing in his grades.
We have...


1052
00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:24.810
...the usual good grades
in mathematics.


1053
00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:26.390
He's doing well there.

1054
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:31.020
13/20. In French,
we have a nine here.


1055
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:32.900
Not a lot.

1056
00:59:33.690 --> 00:59:38.360
He doesn't speak French very well yet
but that's only normal.


1057
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:42.700
He speaks a lot.
He tells me about a lot of things.


1058
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:44.790
He talks about his computer.

1059
00:59:45.370 --> 00:59:47.500
- He's into that.
- Always too late.


1060
00:59:48.290 --> 00:59:49.710
He works too late?

1061
00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.000
Yes, too late, not sleep good.

1062
00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:54.050
After, school not good.

1063
00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:57.550
Eyes get sick after.

1064
00:59:57.970 --> 00:59:59.180
Yes, his eyes.

1065
00:59:59.890 --> 01:00:02.810
He may spend a lot of time
on the computer...


1066
01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:05.680
...but things are fine
at school for now.


1067
01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:08.690
He works well
and he doesn't seem tired.


1068
01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:14.480
Nassim. I'd like him to do...

1069
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:16.070
He can go far.

1070
01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.740
He has all he needs.

1071
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:23.450
At his age, I wasn't that lucky.

1072
01:00:24.450 --> 01:00:25.500
I'm behind him.

1073
01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:28.620
Anything he needs, I get him.

1074
01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.580
But he has to do right.

1075
01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:34.250
Things are good at home with him...

1076
01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:37.220
...but I'd like him
to keep on studying.


1077
01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:39.090
Me and his mother...

1078
01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:41.390
...we'd like to be proud of him.

1079
01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.300
That's what we ask of him.

1080
01:00:44.010 --> 01:00:47.230
I think we all agree
on what we need to do.


1081
01:00:49.770 --> 01:00:51.600
It's crazy how alike you are.

1082
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:53.730
We're lookers in the family.

1083
01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.070
You're right.

1084
01:00:56.110 --> 01:01:00.410
An adolescent who talks
with his family...


1085
01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:03.530
...who has good grades...

1086
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.790
...who has friends...

1087
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:08.870
...even if he's a bit of a loner.

1088
01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.370
He's an outcast?

1089
01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:15.090
He's a boy who talks with adults,
who exchanges with them.


1090
01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:18.130
Maybe he doesn't with you...

1091
01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.630
...but that means...

1092
01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:23.970
...he's just a teenager
trying to define himself.


1093
01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:28.140
I was useless at school for years.

1094
01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:32.270
I rejected the idea
of making us fit in with the system.


1095
01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:36.770
Do his black clothes bother you?
The way he looks?


1096
01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:39.320
I don't get it.

1097
01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:44.910
I'd like him to go to the best,
to Henri IV.


1098
01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:46.660
Henri IV?

1099
01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:50.080
Why?

1100
01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:52.000
Standards again.

1101
01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:54.920
Because they have
very high standards.


1102
01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:58.760
A mother wants the best for her son.

1103
01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:03.340
She's scared I'll feel lost
in high school because the others...


1104
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:08.890
...went to fancy private schools
and Dolto High isn't like that.


1105
01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:13.810
It's a pity that the teachers...

1106
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:16.810
I don't want to accuse anyone...

1107
01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:19.400
Go on, accuse us. 
It's a pleasure.

1108
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:22.860
Why don't you try...

1109
01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:28.870
...to push the better students
a little harder, say?


1110
01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:32.870
They get bogged down
by other students...


1111
01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.500
...who aren't as good.

1112
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:38.540
My mom makes stuff up.
Dolto High isn't useless.


1113
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:42.880
I didn't say useless, 
I said average.

1114
01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.510
I didn't call it useless.

1115
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:52.140
We talked about Souleymane
a great deal...


1116
01:02:52.850 --> 01:02:54.350
...at the staff meeting.

1117
01:02:55.190 --> 01:03:00.190
Many teachers have complained
about his attitude...


1118
01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:03.070
...that is very negative.

1119
01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.700
Many complain
that he comes without his things.


1120
01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.490
When he comes,
as he's often absent.


1121
01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.250
I think you know that.

1122
01:03:13.410 --> 01:03:15.040
No, we didn't know.

1123
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:18.080
Souleymane tells us he works hard.

1124
01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:38.190
- Sorry?
- She doesn't think so.


1125
01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:42.530
There have been notes
in his report book...


1126
01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:45.190
...since September,
three months now.


1127
01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:49.410
Notes about the problems
he was having.


1128
01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:53.410
She signs them without knowing
because she can't read.


1129
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:56.540
You read the notes too?

1130
01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.750
Yes, but I'm just his brother.
You see?


1131
01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:03.300
But you knew there was a problem?

1132
01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:07.470
No, I didn't know.
He says things are fine when I ask.


1133
01:04:07.630 --> 01:04:09.140
Does he work at home?

1134
01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.050
He stays in his room.

1135
01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:12.810
I see.

1136
01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:27.950
She doesn't understand the notes.

1137
01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:29.280
I realize that.

1138
01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:31.910
You know the situation now.

1139
01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.290
I'm telling you officially
there's a problem.


1140
01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:36.660
Talk to him.

1141
01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:38.830
I'll talk to him about it.

1142
01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:45.760
Just having a...

1143
01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:49.590
Maybe a conversation
with his father...


1144
01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:50.800
...could help.

1145
01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:55.180
I'll talk to my father
and see what we can do.


1146
01:04:56.350 --> 01:04:58.060
We're not settling scores.

1147
01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.190
We want to improve things.

1148
01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:18.830
- Your mom?
- You bet.


1149
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.040
Ugly old crow.

1150
01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:22.580
Your ma's ugly, and so are you.

1151
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:25.250
- She sulking?
- No, she hates photos.


1152
01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:29.510
Me and my bro pissed her off.

1153
01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.300
- Let's get started.
- Sir.


1154
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:34.180
Souleymane has photos
for his portrait.


1155
01:05:34.350 --> 01:05:36.470
Cut it out, my photos are crap.

1156
01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.890
That's a good idea.

1157
01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.680
Get your own.

1158
01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:42.060
Painters do self-portraits.

1159
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:43.400
I'm no painter.

1160
01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:46.070
Yes, I know that. Let's go.

1161
01:05:46.650 --> 01:05:48.030
Caps, please.

1162
01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:01.910
I spend all my free time
playing the guitar.


1163
01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:06.710
If you're typing, hurry and finish
to let the others...


1164
01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.090
...type up their self-portraits.

1165
01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:14.090
Don't blow the place up.

1166
01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:16.930
- It's okay.
- You know what you're doing?


1167
01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:21.270
As a computer genius,
you'll put it all back after.


1168
01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.100
Don't worry.

1169
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:24.770
I'm counting on you.

1170
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:31.240
Okay, Carl?

1171
01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.450
Yes, sir.

1172
01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:36.070
- I can't see it?
- No, not yet.


1173
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:40.910
How do you spell Lafayette?

1174
01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:42.620
How do you mean?

1175
01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:44.620
Like Galeries Lafayette.

1176
01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:46.460
Why mention that?

1177
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:49.300
I go there often so
I want to add it.

1178
01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.920
Wow. That's four metro stops.

1179
01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:54.430
A huge leap
from your neighborhood.


1180
01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:58.430
- We're not hicks.
- We're city kids.


1181
01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.760
Really?

1182
01:06:59.930 --> 01:07:02.390
You go into the center of Paris?

1183
01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:07.270
I go everywhere. The first, the fifth,
the 20th, the 12th, the 19th.


1184
01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:09.320
Why do you go to the fifth?

1185
01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:13.820
In the fifth, I go to see pals
in high school.


1186
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:15.400
Near Luxembourg.

1187
01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:17.410
The Luxembourg gardens?

1188
01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:19.780
Not the gardens, Luxembourg.

1189
01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:21.740
The country?

1190
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:26.330
No, the Luxembourg metro station.

1191
01:07:27.790 --> 01:07:30.000
So you do get out and about.

1192
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.010
I see you two have made up.

1193
01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:35.510
- It's our business.
- And not yours.


1194
01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.430
So how do you spell Lafayette?

1195
01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:39.970
Lafayette is...

1196
01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:43.520
L
- A
-F
-A
-Y
-E
-T
-T
-E.

1197
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:45.680
With a capital.

1198
01:07:48.810 --> 01:07:49.860
Much better now.

1199
01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:51.860
Much better.

1200
01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:54.780
Yes, that is a good photo.

1201
01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:57.360
- You could add a legend.
- A legend?


1202
01:07:57.860 --> 01:07:59.660
Like a story or a tale.

1203
01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:03.700
A caption under the photo
like in papers.


1204
01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:06.370
You mean, like in Le Parisien?

1205
01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:08.500
Yes, like in Le Parisien.

1206
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:10.790
What could you put? Who is she?

1207
01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.000
My old woman.

1208
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:13.550
- Meaning?
- My mother.


1209
01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:16.220
You could say she's your mother.

1210
01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:18.300
Then you could explain...

1211
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:21.890
...why she's making this gesture
to the photographer.


1212
01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:23.720
They'd pissed her off.

1213
01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:26.060
I'm not gonna write that.

1214
01:08:26.230 --> 01:08:28.100
So why is she doing that?

1215
01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:29.310
She hates photos.

1216
01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.520
So write that.

1217
01:08:30.690 --> 01:08:33.690
"My mother hates having
her photo taken."


1218
01:08:36.570 --> 01:08:37.990
That's a legend.

1219
01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:40.240
Understand?

1220
01:08:40.410 --> 01:08:43.700
Do that with all the photos
and you're set.


1221
01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:07.270
I'm 5 foot 6
and I can get really mad


1222
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:09.440
- Printed everything?
- Yeah, I'm good.


1223
01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.110
Excellent.

1224
01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:19.610
What are you doing now, sir?

1225
01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:21.070
As you can see...

1226
01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.700
...I'm putting the photos up...

1227
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:25.450
...to get a global view.

1228
01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.960
The others read out
their self-portraits...


1229
01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.080
...so you're going to put yours...

1230
01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:35.630
...on show.

1231
01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.880
You know my photos suck.

1232
01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:40.630
Not at all, they're very good.

1233
01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:41.970
Sure.

1234
01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:46.310
When a student does good work,
I let the whole class see it.


1235
01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:49.230
You're just winding me up.

1236
01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:51.730
No, I wind you up if I feel...

1237
01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:53.980
...you can do better. This is good.

1238
01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.440
That's bullshit.

1239
01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:58.650
If you've finished...

1240
01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:03.660
...come and take a look
at Souleymane's masterpiece.


1241
01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.320
Slowly.

1242
01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:11.080
I'll straighten them.

1243
01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:12.500
Look at the tattoo.

1244
01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:25.800
You're hideous.

1245
01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:50.450
I like playing soccer.

1246
01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:53.000
I like playing computer games.

1247
01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.710
I like playing with pretty girls.

1248
01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:58.500
I like vacations in the Caribbean.

1249
01:10:58.710 --> 01:11:01.840
I like fries,
zouk and dance-hall music.


1250
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:05.380
I like watching MTV Base...

1251
01:11:06.010 --> 01:11:08.350
...and I like my parents
and my brother.


1252
01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:11.470
I like my pals
and staying up all night.


1253
01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:14.560
I like the series on the slave trade.

1254
01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:16.400
I like my 'hood.

1255
01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:19.730
I like the series Homeland Security.

1256
01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:23.860
I like eating in restaurants
and going wild.


1257
01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:27.870
I hate people crying for no reason.

1258
01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:30.410
I hate techno and tectonic.

1259
01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:32.910
I hate guys and girls who show off.

1260
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:36.080
I hate visiting my brother in jail.

1261
01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:39.880
I hate talent-contest shows on TV.

1262
01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:42.380
I hate politicians...

1263
01:11:42.670 --> 01:11:44.090
...the war in Iraq...

1264
01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.510
...Goths and skaters.

1265
01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:49.680
I hate teachers who are too strict.

1266
01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:52.720
I hate mathematics, racists...

1267
01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:54.890
...and I hate Materazzi.

1268
01:11:55.230 --> 01:11:57.560
I hated the Paul Eluard school...

1269
01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:59.610
...and I like being here.

1270
01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.360
I have something to say.

1271
01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:11.580
Could you listen to me, please?

1272
01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:13.540
I have something to say.

1273
01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:17.250
The mother of Wei, a student
in 4/3 has been arrested.


1274
01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:20.920
She was in France illegally.

1275
01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:25.920
She has been picked up
and may be tried next week.


1276
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:29.260
She may be deported to China.
I thought you should know...


1277
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:30.760
...as it's important.

1278
01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:33.430
She's been here three years now.

1279
01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.930
I know...

1280
01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:40.940
...but that's how it goes,
wrong place, wrong time.


1281
01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:42.770
Not the father?

1282
01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:46.940
He doesn't have papers either
but they don't bother him.


1283
01:12:48.450 --> 01:12:53.740
To start with,
as lawyers cost a lot...


1284
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:56.790
...we could do a collection...

1285
01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.920
...and maybe even go to court...

1286
01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:03.630
...to try to have some influence
on the verdict.


1287
01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.630
Will Wei have to leave?

1288
01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:09.130
Not for now but you never know.

1289
01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:15.140
Well.

1290
01:13:15.810 --> 01:13:19.140
I feel kind of pathetic after that.

1291
01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:24.110
I had something to tell you,
but this isn't a good time.


1292
01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:26.150
You've said too much now.

1293
01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.610
I'm pregnant.

1294
01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:37.490
That calls for a celebration.

1295
01:13:41.370 --> 01:13:42.620
How far along?

1296
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:45.500
Two months. I'll only have a drop.

1297
01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:47.340
Just a drop.

1298
01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:52.300
Bravo, Vincent.

1299
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:55.850
- He's an expert.
- I didn't do it on purpose.


1300
01:13:56.850 --> 01:13:58.020
Who shook it?

1301
01:14:00.190 --> 01:14:01.350
Any names yet?

1302
01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.810
If it's a boy, say?

1303
01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:05.810
If it's a boy, 
I like Enguerran.

1304
01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:07.650
- Enguerran?
- Yes.


1305
01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:08.860
Seriously?

1306
01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.700
What a handicap. 
That won't be easy.

1307
01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:15.870
I hope not. Thanks a lot.

1308
01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:21.210
You all have a glass?

1309
01:14:21.370 --> 01:14:23.330
Hold on a second.

1310
01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:24.670
Right.

1311
01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:31.380
I have two wishes.

1312
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:33.220
My first wish...

1313
01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:37.220
...is that Wei's mom stays in France.

1314
01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:41.060
And my second wish...

1315
01:14:41.230 --> 01:14:44.850
...is that my child will be
as intelligent as Wei.


1316
01:14:58.910 --> 01:15:00.240
Jackie Chan.

1317
01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.080
Come on, play.

1318
01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.880
I didn't do nothing.

1319
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:15.930
He just fell.

1320
01:15:34.450 --> 01:15:36.490
Play, Souleymane.

1321
01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.790
What do you say, Mali man?

1322
01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:44.080
What's up, you Caribbean shit?

1323
01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:48.790
Asshole.

1324
01:15:49.290 --> 01:15:50.630
Come on, let's play.

1325
01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.630
I'll waste the loser.

1326
01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.510
Caribbean fag.

1327
01:15:58.140 --> 01:15:59.800
Screw Thierry Henry.

1328
01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:07.140
Stand there. Talk loud enough
for them to hear...


1329
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:10.810
...and try to convince them.
Go ahead.


1330
01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:14.320
The Africa Cup of Nations
will be starting soon.


1331
01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.280
I'm glad Morocco's playing.

1332
01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:20.950
It's the best team in the world
in my opinion.


1333
01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:25.160
The sick thing is that my pals,
the Malians, aren't playing.


1334
01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:26.830
It's tough for them.

1335
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.330
They weren't good enough
to qualify.


1336
01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:35.670
Morocco would have let them play
on a friendly basis...


1337
01:16:35.970 --> 01:16:39.010
...but 4-0 really hurts.

1338
01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:42.140
4-0 how?

1339
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:45.140
Last time Mali played Morocco...

1340
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:46.680
...they wasted them 4-0.

1341
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:49.770
But the weird thing is...

1342
01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:53.020
...when Mali doesn't play...

1343
01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:56.190
...it's like all the Africans here...

1344
01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:58.030
...aren't African.

1345
01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:01.200
With each cup, they all go crazy...

1346
01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:05.490
...but when Mali doesn't play,
they keep a low profile.


1347
01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:06.700
Weird.

1348
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:11.540
So, whether Mali plays
in the Africa Cup of Nations or not...


1349
01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:16.380
...the Africans in this class
feel more or less African. Okay.


1350
01:17:17.050 --> 01:17:19.050
Thank you, Nassim.

1351
01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.890
I get the feeling
your words are directed...


1352
01:17:23.050 --> 01:17:25.350
...at your neighbor, Souleymane.

1353
01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:28.060
Morocco jerk's not even
on my radar.


1354
01:17:30.190 --> 01:17:31.730
Arthur is next.

1355
01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:38.030
I see you have your notes...

1356
01:17:38.190 --> 01:17:39.860
...just like a politician.

1357
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:41.070
That's good.

1358
01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:44.570
Speak up, Arthur.
Esmeralda, let him speak first.


1359
01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:46.240
I want to defend my look.

1360
01:17:46.410 --> 01:17:50.250
A lot of people say it sucks.

1361
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:53.750
I don't dis your clothes...

1362
01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.880
...so you don't dis mine.

1363
01:17:58.210 --> 01:18:00.090
Clothes are freedom of speech.

1364
01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.090
I dress how I want...

1365
01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:04.760
...you dress how you want, okay.

1366
01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:10.560
I dress like this to be different
and not follow the others like sheep.


1367
01:18:10.890 --> 01:18:12.770
You're the sheep here.

1368
01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:16.110
I feel better being myself...

1369
01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:19.110
...and not being like others.

1370
01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:23.780
I also think
if there were 22 Goths here...


1371
01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:26.950
...and one guy like you,
you'd keep quiet then.


1372
01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.960
There's a contradiction
in what you say.


1373
01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.920
You want to be you.
Are those clothes you?


1374
01:18:36.090 --> 01:18:40.090
Those clothes are worn
by a huge number of people.


1375
01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:43.470
Most people who wear them
are gloomy inside...


1376
01:18:43.630 --> 01:18:46.140
...so we're all kind of alike.

1377
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:50.770
You're all alike, you're all gloomy,
so that's not you.


1378
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:52.140
By being different.

1379
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:54.440
You're different and the same.

1380
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:58.320
Thank you for taking a stand...

1381
01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.320
...and being brave enough to do so.

1382
01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:03.150
Boubacar, go on.

1383
01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:05.320
Boubacar, my pal.

1384
01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.160
Listen to him.

1385
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:13.500
I've come up to reply to Nassim.

1386
01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:18.000
He says that since Mali
isn't in the Africa Cup of Nations...


1387
01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:21.130
...black Africans
have no team to support.


1388
01:19:21.630 --> 01:19:23.840
But he's forgetting Ivory Coast.

1389
01:19:24.010 --> 01:19:26.470
With an ace player, 
Didier Drogba.

1390
01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:28.800
He beats any Moroccan.

1391
01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:33.020
He plays for Chelsea.

1392
01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.850
What Moroccan plays in England?

1393
01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:38.060
They're not up to it.

1394
01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:40.020
- I'm through.
- Thanks, Boubacar.


1395
01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:43.360
I think that rectification
was indeed...


1396
01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.700
...indispensable.

1397
01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.870
Who wants to speak now?

1398
01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:51.700
Carl, go on.

1399
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.710
Actually, I'd like to say...

1400
01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:04.710
...they're starting to piss us off
with the Africa Cup.


1401
01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:09.010
At recess you're there,
pissing us off with your cup.


1402
01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:11.390
It hasn't even started yet.

1403
01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:14.180
Carl, I'll be polite with you.

1404
01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:18.230
Sorry to interrupt, but tell me,
what's your national team?


1405
01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.110
France.

1406
01:20:21.190 --> 01:20:24.690
Why do you say you're Caribbean
rather than French?


1407
01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:25.940
We're French.

1408
01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:28.860
It's a French region.

1409
01:20:29.410 --> 01:20:31.740
Why don't you ever say
you're French?


1410
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:33.740
- It's the same.
- I don't think so.


1411
01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:38.920
Look at the players. Thierry Henry,
Wiltord, Abidal, Thuram.


1412
01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:41.250
Where does Diarra play?

1413
01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:44.750
He won't play in Mali, bro,
he's not crazy enough.


1414
01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:48.300
Shut your mouth, pal,
I'm not your bro.


1415
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.590
An ape like this jerk.

1416
01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:53.930
No need to lose your cool.

1417
01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:56.060
New and already the big shot.

1418
01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:58.940
We can talk calmly.

1419
01:21:00.770 --> 01:21:02.900
This isn't a slanging match.

1420
01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:04.270
It's a debate.

1421
01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:07.110
Souleymane, watch your language.

1422
01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.450
He's fuming.

1423
01:21:08.610 --> 01:21:10.910
Clam up. Screw off.

1424
01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.280
No vulgarity.

1425
01:21:13.450 --> 01:21:15.950
- I ain't talking to you, man.
- I'm talking to you.


1426
01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:20.460
Is that any way
to talk to a teacher?

1427
01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:22.630
That's enough now.

1428
01:21:23.130 --> 01:21:24.590
You're coming with me.

1429
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:25.960
I'm talking to you.

1430
01:21:26.130 --> 01:21:28.630
Don't start yelling at me, okay.

1431
01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:32.930
I'll get you, faggot.

1432
01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:35.310
You just can't talk normally?

1433
01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:38.980
Nobody else moves.

1434
01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:57.160
Hurry it up.

1435
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.120
- Move it.
- Hands off.


1436
01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:20.180
Aren't you sick of assing around?

1437
01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:31.860
Sorry to bother you.

1438
01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:36.530
I have a troublemaker
who's been disrespectful in class.


1439
01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:43.040
I didn't ask you to sit down.

1440
01:22:48.210 --> 01:22:49.550
My class is waiting.

1441
01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:51.050
I'll see to this.

1442
01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.730
Sit down now.

1443
01:23:09.570 --> 01:23:11.360
I'm listening.

1444
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:18.030
Will you tell me what happened?

1445
01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:23.410
A teacher should have to leave
his class to bring you here?


1446
01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:32.880
"Results...

1447
01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.380
...too uneven.

1448
01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:38.390
Too much talking in class."

1449
01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:46.440
Now let's move on to Louise...

1450
01:23:46.770 --> 01:23:48.440
...present here today.

1451
01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:51.900
A total disaster.
What can we do with you?


1452
01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:54.110
No, good work.

1453
01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.950
Always good, I'd say.

1454
01:23:56.110 --> 01:24:00.450
It's a joy having a student like her.
We need to say it.


1455
01:24:01.290 --> 01:24:04.450
Shall we offer this young lady
a commendation?


1456
01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:08.790
I'm sorry,
but I don't totally agree with you.


1457
01:24:09.090 --> 01:24:14.340
She's relatively well-placed
in the class from a numerical angle.


1458
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:15.970
But a commendation?

1459
01:24:16.130 --> 01:24:20.850
There's room for progress,
huge room for progress...


1460
01:24:21.010 --> 01:24:23.810
...and I don't think
her general attitude...


1461
01:24:23.970 --> 01:24:26.020
...really merits a commendation.

1462
01:24:26.230 --> 01:24:28.440
That's the problem
with commendations.


1463
01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:30.440
Are they purely numerical...

1464
01:24:30.610 --> 01:24:33.530
...and mathematical
or are they also to do...


1465
01:24:33.730 --> 01:24:38.610
...with her attitude and behavior
as top of the class?


1466
01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:42.030
That means,
to get a commendation...


1467
01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:45.160
...you have to be
an excellent student...


1468
01:24:45.370 --> 01:24:49.500
...and, at the same time,
be a class leader?


1469
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.340
So a commendation this term.

1470
01:24:55.510 --> 01:25:01.180
Louise is intelligent and will realize
she can do better to satisfy you.


1471
01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:09.850
Now, Chérif.

1472
01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:12.020
Our friend Chérif.

1473
01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:14.070
I have a problem with Chérif.

1474
01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:17.190
He's a kid with abilities,
he could do well.


1475
01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.860
I could easily give him 17/20...

1476
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:24.870
...but he spends so much time talking
and disturbing the class...


1477
01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:28.040
...his average grade is poor.
And that's a pity.


1478
01:25:28.210 --> 01:25:31.370
His behavior's irregular.
He can be a disaster...


1479
01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:34.790
...and you can't do a thing
with him...


1480
01:25:35.050 --> 01:25:37.210
...or he can be really good.

1481
01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:39.380
What does Chérif get?

1482
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:42.550
A warning about his work
or his behavior?


1483
01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:45.050
For me, behavior, not work.

1484
01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:47.720
In my class, it's more his work.

1485
01:25:47.890 --> 01:25:51.390
It's more like a work problem
looking at his grades.


1486
01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:54.560
Mathematics: 6.

1487
01:25:54.730 --> 01:25:57.070
French: 8.

1488
01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:00.570
History and geography: 9.

1489
01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:03.570
English: 9.5.

1490
01:26:04.410 --> 01:26:05.740
Excuse me.

1491
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:11.580
Science: 12. Music: 11.

1492
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:15.920
His grades are pretty low but it
seems to be a behavior problem.


1493
01:26:16.090 --> 01:26:21.260
Why don't we put that for now
and say he can work harder?


1494
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:23.260
So I'll put "Chérif...

1495
01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:27.100
...can succeed as long as...

1496
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:30.100
...his attitude changes...

1497
01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:31.940
...in relation to his work."

1498
01:26:35.610 --> 01:26:38.110
Let's move on to Souleymane.

1499
01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:41.950
Souleymane.
Someone else can start.


1500
01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:44.450
What do we say?

1501
01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:46.780
- Nothing good.
- What else?


1502
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:49.990
We already discussed him
in the first term.


1503
01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.410
We said it all.

1504
01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:56.170
He has huge weaknesses,
notably in written French.


1505
01:26:56.670 --> 01:26:59.300
I don't think there's anything...

1506
01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:01.170
...particularly new...

1507
01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:03.590
...this term.

1508
01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:05.640
Feeling better, Esmeralda?

1509
01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:09.390
I didn't know being class rep
was such fun.


1510
01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:12.310
We were talking about Souleymane.

1511
01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:15.980
In relation
to what François just said...


1512
01:27:16.150 --> 01:27:20.480
...he forgot his things
most of the time this term...


1513
01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:22.820
...and didn't do much.

1514
01:27:22.990 --> 01:27:26.660
It's not just that,
it's way beyond that.


1515
01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:32.040
He's more and more unruly. He
prevents the others from working.


1516
01:27:32.410 --> 01:27:34.120
Can I say something?

1517
01:27:34.290 --> 01:27:38.500
If you put the biscuits away.
Remember, you aren't allowed...


1518
01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:40.340
...to eat in a classroom.

1519
01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:46.180
Well, his overall grade
has gone from 6.75 to 7.25.


1520
01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:48.430
So.

1521
01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:54.680
We're not discussing his grades
but his behavior for now.


1522
01:27:54.850 --> 01:27:56.730
I have the impression...

1523
01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:59.560
...we need to consider
disciplinary action.


1524
01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:01.860
His attitude's wrong.

1525
01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:05.360
It's simple. Every other class,
I throw him out.


1526
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:09.030
I don't even throw him out anymore.

1527
01:28:09.490 --> 01:28:12.700
He's only too happy when I do.

1528
01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:16.210
I don't think disciplinary action
will help...


1529
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:19.380
...because things will get
really bad then.


1530
01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:23.420
They're already really bad.
It's gone too far.


1531
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:27.260
It's like he's mad at the others
for being normal.


1532
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:33.010
I'll remind you, Mr. Marin,
you brought him to me yesterday.


1533
01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:36.600
Yes, but it was this year's
first incident.


1534
01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:39.400
He was disrespectful, 
I set a limit.

1535
01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:42.570
I did what I
did but I don't think...

1536
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:45.860
...it will go any further than that.

1537
01:28:47.110 --> 01:28:49.740
I don't have any real complaints...

1538
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:51.570
...apart from yesterday.

1539
01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:53.700
Our job isn't to make sure...

1540
01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:57.750
...students sit quietly at the back
and don't cause any trouble.


1541
01:28:58.080 --> 01:28:59.920
We have to bring them out.

1542
01:29:00.630 --> 01:29:03.920
I won't do that
with threats or punishment.


1543
01:29:04.090 --> 01:29:07.970
I'd rather stress his good work.
Some things interest him.


1544
01:29:08.130 --> 01:29:11.050
He can come out
with some pretty good stuff.


1545
01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:15.060
Simply because he does
something positive now and then...


1546
01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:19.100
...we let him sink
and wallow in his hole...


1547
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:20.560
...and we do nothing.

1548
01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:24.070
You just want
to buy social harmony.


1549
01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:28.150
That said...

1550
01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:31.780
...what do we say? What do we do?
A warning?


1551
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:36.080
I don't think a warning's
what he needs.


1552
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:40.160
Maybe we should say
he has reached his limit...


1553
01:29:40.330 --> 01:29:43.170
...because he's limited
scholastically.


1554
01:29:48.970 --> 01:29:53.300
That's all well and good
but I'm dim and have a line to fill.


1555
01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:55.100
What do we put?

1556
01:29:55.850 --> 01:29:58.810
It's not right saying that.

1557
01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:10.360
Three rhymes per verse.
What do you call that?


1558
01:30:10.570 --> 01:30:12.660
Verses of three lines. Wei?

1559
01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:15.320
- A tercet.
- Very good.


1560
01:30:16.330 --> 01:30:18.120
And four rhymes would be?

1561
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.290
A quatrain.

1562
01:30:21.170 --> 01:30:22.670
From quatre, four.

1563
01:30:22.830 --> 01:30:25.170
Tercet, three rhymes. 
Quatrain, four.

1564
01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:29.010
How many syllables per line?
Can you tell me that?


1565
01:30:29.170 --> 01:30:31.010
- Khoumba?
- I know here are 10.


1566
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:32.630
You know that?

1567
01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:34.390
- Want me to show you?
- Yes.


1568
01:30:38.810 --> 01:30:40.310
- That's 10.
- You say:


1569
01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:44.850
You have two extra syllables...

1570
01:30:45.230 --> 01:30:47.150
...by counting the mute Es.

1571
01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:49.530
Don't count them, they're mute.

1572
01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:53.320
That makes eight.

1573
01:30:54.110 --> 01:30:56.200
We can underline each syllable.

1574
01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:01.830
I'll come back to that one.

1575
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.330
Two octo-syllables
and one four-syllable line.


1576
01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:07.920
- What is it?
-11.47, that makes...


1577
01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:09.670
Eleven point five?

1578
01:31:10.050 --> 01:31:12.920
Is the number of syllables here?

1579
01:31:13.130 --> 01:31:14.680
No, my grade. It's down.

1580
01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:17.010
What's that to do with poetry?

1581
01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:19.560
They lowered my grade.

1582
01:31:19.930 --> 01:31:21.720
Who gave you your grade?

1583
01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:23.890
You shouldn't have it yet.

1584
01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:25.730
Esmeralda told me.

1585
01:31:27.020 --> 01:31:30.270
So the class reps
did do something after all.


1586
01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:32.740
I took a load of notes.

1587
01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:38.070
I got the impression you weren't
really following the meeting.


1588
01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:40.080
Louise, I'm delighted.

1589
01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:43.410
You've done a good job
passing on information.


1590
01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:45.580
Let's get back to this poem.

1591
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:50.590
The rule is to count
in front of a consonant.


1592
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:52.260
What?

1593
01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:57.090
I heard you really wiped me out
at the meeting yesterday.


1594
01:31:57.390 --> 01:32:00.100
Another remark about poetry, I see.

1595
01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:01.640
No, it isn't.

1596
01:32:01.810 --> 01:32:04.430
Yes, I know it isn't about poetry.

1597
01:32:05.890 --> 01:32:06.980
What do you mean?

1598
01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:09.940
I don't know. You wiped me out.

1599
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:17.240
Some people, not me,
said if you carry on like this...


1600
01:32:17.410 --> 01:32:20.990
Some teachers said
if you carry on like this...


1601
01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:23.620
...you'll be in trouble,
not "wiped out."


1602
01:32:24.290 --> 01:32:26.290
That's revenge. 
I don't get it.

1603
01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:28.080
Why go for revenge?

1604
01:32:28.250 --> 01:32:30.290
How come it's revenge?

1605
01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:35.260
If you say stuff about me
getting in trouble, that's revenge.


1606
01:32:36.130 --> 01:32:37.930
It's not revenge at all.

1607
01:32:38.090 --> 01:32:39.840
- You say it isn't?
- Not at all.


1608
01:32:40.010 --> 01:32:41.800
We're not on the streets.

1609
01:32:41.970 --> 01:32:43.640
It's a warning.

1610
01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:49.980
Our goal here isn't revenge,
it's discipline. Get the difference?


1611
01:32:50.150 --> 01:32:51.150
I don't get it.

1612
01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:54.980
When a judge sends
someone to jail...


1613
01:32:55.150 --> 01:32:57.820
...he doesn't do it to get revenge.

1614
01:32:57.990 --> 01:33:00.320
It helps society run smoothly.

1615
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:04.200
You just want revenge.
You're riffed with me.


1616
01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:06.330
All I care about is revenge?

1617
01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:07.790
I wake up and say...

1618
01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:09.960
...I'll get Souleymane today?

1619
01:33:10.130 --> 01:33:14.800
You insulted him yesterday anyhow.
He really laid into you.


1620
01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:16.050
I did not.

1621
01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:18.510
What did he say, Louise?

1622
01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:22.350
That you were "limited."
I underlined it, I was so shocked.


1623
01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:24.810
Me? Limited?

1624
01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:29.690
Brilliant.

1625
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:44.370
What's your role as class reps?

1626
01:33:44.530 --> 01:33:47.910
You represent the students
to help this class work...


1627
01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:50.580
...or you stir up trouble for me?

1628
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:52.210
We just do our job.

1629
01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:53.420
Wicked.

1630
01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:55.380
We report on the meeting.

1631
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:56.750
Of course.

1632
01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.300
I didn't realize.

1633
01:33:58.550 --> 01:34:02.550
When I saw you snigger
at the meeting, I felt bad.


1634
01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:03.840
l felt bad for you.

1635
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:08.720
It wasn't the place or time.
It didn't look very serious.


1636
01:34:08.890 --> 01:34:11.020
Nobody minded in any case.

1637
01:34:11.190 --> 01:34:12.690
- They did.
- Only you.


1638
01:34:12.850 --> 01:34:16.820
No, it bothered me and I think
it bothered the others too.


1639
01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:20.030
It only bothered you.

1640
01:34:22.410 --> 01:34:25.620
Sorry, but laughing like that
made you look like two skanks.


1641
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:26.910
What?

1642
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:29.410
Have you just lost it?

1643
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:31.580
That's a bad thing.

1644
01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:34.920
You can't dump on us.

1645
01:34:35.250 --> 01:34:36.920
The word is "insult."

1646
01:34:37.090 --> 01:34:39.090
You're crazy, insulting on us.

1647
01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:41.920
You say "dump on" or "insult."

1648
01:34:42.090 --> 01:34:44.470
It's either one or the other, okay.

1649
01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:46.760
- Yeah, keep on talking.
- In fact...


1650
01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:49.970
...I never said you were skanks.

1651
01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:53.270
I said that at one point
in the meeting...


1652
01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:55.810
...you acted like skanks.
Understand?


1653
01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:58.940
Don't try to con us, you said skanks.

1654
01:34:59.110 --> 01:35:01.650
I'm just explaining the difference.

1655
01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:04.610
Sir, you don't talk to girls like that.

1656
01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:08.330
Look who's talking.
You always insult everybody.


1657
01:35:08.490 --> 01:35:10.290
He wants revenge on the girls.

1658
01:35:10.450 --> 01:35:14.460
No way. The "noble knight
riding to rescue" act...


1659
01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:15.620
...won't wash.

1660
01:35:15.790 --> 01:35:17.750
You don't talk to me, man.

1661
01:35:18.750 --> 01:35:20.130
Show some respect.

1662
01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:21.880
I will if I want.

1663
01:35:22.130 --> 01:35:23.970
You're heading for trouble.

1664
01:35:24.130 --> 01:35:25.430
Think you're tough?

1665
01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:29.310
- It's a question of discipline.
- I'll take you anytime.


1666
01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:31.770
Stop playing the big shot.

1667
01:35:31.930 --> 01:35:33.310
Calm down.

1668
01:35:35.310 --> 01:35:36.520
Stay out of this.

1669
01:35:36.690 --> 01:35:38.480
Cut it out.

1670
01:35:38.650 --> 01:35:40.780
Don't touch me.

1671
01:35:47.530 --> 01:35:49.660
- You're crazy.
- I'm out of here.


1672
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:52.120
You can't just walk out of my class.

1673
01:35:52.290 --> 01:35:53.700
Are you nuts?

1674
01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:55.830
- Calm down.
- Let go of me.


1675
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.040
Stop it.

1676
01:36:00.670 --> 01:36:02.840
- Where are you going?
- Let go, asshole.


1677
01:36:03.010 --> 01:36:04.670
Pathetic.

1678
01:36:15.850 --> 01:36:16.940
Fuck.

1679
01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:28.660
Incident report

1680
01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:32.080
What do we do?

1681
01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:37.750
I think we need to convene
the disciplinary committee.


1682
01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:42.710
This is starting to add up.
It begins...


1683
01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:47.680
...with disrespect, then the fight,
with a student injured...


1684
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:52.050
...and finally he leaves the class
without permission.


1685
01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:56.230
There was only one incident
and it all spread out from there.


1686
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:59.900
One thing led to another,
a chain reaction.


1687
01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:03.940
Well, what I can do is take...

1688
01:37:04.110 --> 01:37:07.360
...a protective measure
since this is so serious...


1689
01:37:07.530 --> 01:37:10.910
...by suspending Souleymane
for 48 hours.


1690
01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:16.000
That'll give us a little time
to reach a decision.


1691
01:37:18.250 --> 01:37:19.580
Shall we do that?

1692
01:37:20.250 --> 01:37:23.420
However,
I need to see you tomorrow.


1693
01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:26.760
Could you come to my office?

1694
01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:31.300
François.

1695
01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:35.260
I need a word with you.

1696
01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:38.810
There's a rumor going around.

1697
01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:40.770
A rumor?

1698
01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:44.730
Some students came to see me
and told me...


1699
01:37:48.110 --> 01:37:49.740
...you insulted them.

1700
01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:54.580
Who? Louise and Esmeralda?

1701
01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:57.950
They told me
you called them skanks...


1702
01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:01.620
...and that led to the incident
with Souleymane.


1703
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:03.460
And you believe them?

1704
01:38:04.290 --> 01:38:06.460
That's why I needed to see you.

1705
01:38:06.670 --> 01:38:09.920
You didn't mention it
in your incident report.


1706
01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:13.800
I didn't mention it.
What can I say?


1707
01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:16.140
- Did you do it or not?
- What?


1708
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:17.850
Did you...?

1709
01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:21.640
Did you call them skanks?

1710
01:38:22.190 --> 01:38:24.100
But Souleymane's another matter.

1711
01:38:24.270 --> 01:38:27.150
I know it had nothing
to do with him.


1712
01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:29.650
But word's getting around.

1713
01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:33.030
People are talking.
I wanted to let you know.


1714
01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:35.160
Thanks for letting me know.

1715
01:38:47.170 --> 01:38:48.170
Hey, you two.

1716
01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:50.510
You complained about me.
Thanks a lot.


1717
01:38:50.670 --> 01:38:51.970
You're welcome.

1718
01:38:52.630 --> 01:38:54.510
You could have talked to me.

1719
01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:58.180
Teachers can complain about us
and vice versa, right?


1720
01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:01.480
No, it doesn't work both ways.

1721
01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:04.140
What are you after?

1722
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:05.520
To see you punished.

1723
01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:07.190
- Punished?
- Yes.


1724
01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:08.360
You, punish me?

1725
01:39:08.530 --> 01:39:10.860
You insulted us, you get punished.

1726
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:12.700
Where will that get you?

1727
01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:14.360
I'll have spoken out.

1728
01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:17.240
Great, that's a lot of use.

1729
01:39:17.410 --> 01:39:19.490
Do you know what "skank" means?

1730
01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:21.540
I never called you skanks.

1731
01:39:21.710 --> 01:39:24.710
Yes, you did.
For me, skank means prostitute.


1732
01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:28.540
- It's not that at all.
- It is.


1733
01:39:28.710 --> 01:39:31.130
For me, it doesn't mean that.

1734
01:39:31.670 --> 01:39:36.680
It's nothing important at all,
just a girl laughing stupidly.


1735
01:39:36.850 --> 01:39:40.010
Hey, skank means prostitute, right?

1736
01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:41.220
You bet.

1737
01:39:41.390 --> 01:39:42.930
Will Souleymane get expelled?

1738
01:39:44.230 --> 01:39:45.770
A disciplinary hearing?

1739
01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:48.940
We don't know yet.
It's a possibility.


1740
01:39:49.150 --> 01:39:52.110
Stop yelling
before anything's decided.


1741
01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:54.150
It's all settled anyway.

1742
01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:56.360
Why say that?

1743
01:39:56.530 --> 01:39:58.410
Because it's always the same.

1744
01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:04.750
You're in no position to talk.
You're the one who got hurt.


1745
01:40:04.910 --> 01:40:08.460
He didn't mean it.
There was a metal thing in his bag.


1746
01:40:08.670 --> 01:40:11.960
In any case, he blew a fuse
and that's bad.


1747
01:40:12.170 --> 01:40:14.590
Sir, anyone can blow a fuse.

1748
01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:16.590
And then calm down after.

1749
01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:17.890
That's not sure.

1750
01:40:18.090 --> 01:40:19.760
You did.

1751
01:40:19.930 --> 01:40:21.060
You're calmer now.

1752
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:23.270
I'm not. You don't know me.

1753
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:27.140
All the teachers say
your attitude is perfect now.


1754
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:29.310
You think you've tamed me?

1755
01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:34.650
No, being sent here
helped you understand things, see?


1756
01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:37.950
It didn't help me.
I don't understand your shit.


1757
01:40:38.110 --> 01:40:41.330
Maybe your old teachers
wanted to help you...


1758
01:40:41.490 --> 01:40:43.830
...and we'll do the same
for Souleymane.


1759
01:40:44.290 --> 01:40:48.000
I say teachers who expel students
are asses.


1760
01:40:48.210 --> 01:40:49.250
Right on.

1761
01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:52.920
You want to repeat that?

1762
01:40:53.090 --> 01:40:54.170
Yeah, assholes.

1763
01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:57.010
Everyone goes wild
over some word I said.


1764
01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:59.590
You say asshole
and I shouldn't react?


1765
01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:01.850
- They're assholes.
- Cut it out.


1766
01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:03.970
You say skanks.

1767
01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:06.810
We say asshole.
It's the same thing.


1768
01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:08.690
They're nothing alike.

1769
01:41:08.850 --> 01:41:11.150
A teacher can say certain things...

1770
01:41:11.310 --> 01:41:14.860
...that students can't say.
Try to understand that.


1771
01:41:15.530 --> 01:41:19.990
You keep talking all the time.
You never stop speaking.


1772
01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:23.280
Whenever we talk, you yell.
What is this?


1773
01:41:23.490 --> 01:41:24.540
Enough.

1774
01:41:36.170 --> 01:41:37.340
Sir.

1775
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:38.510
What?

1776
01:41:40.890 --> 01:41:43.680
Will Souleymane get a hearing?

1777
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:46.010
Give it a rest.

1778
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:49.810
You sound like you want him to.
It fires you up.


1779
01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:52.810
You know what'll happen
if he's expelled?


1780
01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:55.520
He'll change schools.

1781
01:41:55.690 --> 01:41:57.650
No, he won't change schools.

1782
01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:02.360
It's automatic. It's obligatory.
That goes for Souleymane too.


1783
01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:05.370
Do you know his father?

1784
01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:08.000
I've seen him once or twice.

1785
01:42:08.370 --> 01:42:12.420
If he's expelled, his dad'll send him
back to their village.


1786
01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:15.210
Don't get overdramatic.

1787
01:42:16.050 --> 01:42:17.880
He'll go back to Mali.

1788
01:42:18.670 --> 01:42:21.380
I think we all need
to keep our heads.


1789
01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:23.430
Don't worry.

1790
01:42:37.070 --> 01:42:38.900
You can't smoke here, sir.

1791
01:42:41.070 --> 01:42:43.450
I know, but since I was alone...

1792
01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:10.270
Okay, you went too far
with those girls.


1793
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:12.140
We all screw up.

1794
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:13.730
Souleymane overreacted.

1795
01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:15.770
He's right. I saw Khoumba.

1796
01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.150
Her face was all bloody.

1797
01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:20.570
What he did is unacceptable.

1798
01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:21.900
That's for sure.

1799
01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:27.450
I know that.
His bag hit her by accident.


1800
01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:30.740
A split eyebrow bleeds a lot.
That's all.


1801
01:43:31.370 --> 01:43:33.790
You can't ignore it.

1802
01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:38.420
Don't take it to heart.
Seen how they talk to us?


1803
01:43:39.130 --> 01:43:44.090
How's that relevant?
Souleymane is going to get expelled.


1804
01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:48.640
That's kind of logical.

1805
01:43:49.390 --> 01:43:51.470
Let's talk about that.

1806
01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:54.980
How many hearings last year?

1807
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:59.980
Twelve at least.

1808
01:44:00.690 --> 01:44:01.820
Not that many.

1809
01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:03.610
He could be right.

1810
01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:07.280
I know, I'm on the committee
so I saw them all.


1811
01:44:07.450 --> 01:44:10.660
An average of two a month,
twelve in all...


1812
01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:12.490
...with an expulsion each time.

1813
01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:15.870
The hearing
is where we talk things over.


1814
01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:19.000
Okay, 12 students were expelled...

1815
01:44:19.170 --> 01:44:21.840
...but maybe
there was no other solution.


1816
01:44:22.210 --> 01:44:25.510
Twelve out of 12.

1817
01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:28.340
Talk about a debate.

1818
01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:31.470
But twelve out of 12 just means...

1819
01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:35.810
...when a student has a hearing,
it's too late.


1820
01:44:35.980 --> 01:44:37.350
Or it was justified.

1821
01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:40.690
Okay, things happen
that lead to a hearing.


1822
01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:42.570
But then what happens?

1823
01:44:43.230 --> 01:44:45.530
What do we expect from a hearing?

1824
01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:47.240
There are prior stages.

1825
01:44:47.450 --> 01:44:50.320
Pre-disciplinary committees.

1826
01:44:50.490 --> 01:44:53.740
We inform the parents,
the students are warned.


1827
01:44:54.750 --> 01:44:56.250
Not in this case.

1828
01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:58.040
We've no time.

1829
01:44:58.210 --> 01:44:59.710
It's pretty rare.

1830
01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:04.420
It's rare because we have
this final punishment...


1831
01:45:04.590 --> 01:45:07.470
...that allows us
to ignore the prior steps.


1832
01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:10.340
And even if we did use them...

1833
01:45:11.050 --> 01:45:14.470
...the simple fact
of expelling a student...


1834
01:45:14.770 --> 01:45:19.100
...is a disavowal
of everything we have tried.


1835
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:23.110
Okay, but it's Souleymane's chance
to justify himself.


1836
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:27.280
At a hearing, you don't speak.
You're scared.


1837
01:45:27.490 --> 01:45:30.360
- You're paralyzed.
- Exactly.


1838
01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:32.490
Let me sum this up.

1839
01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:35.290
He'll get a disciplinary hearing...

1840
01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:36.620
...he'll be expelled...

1841
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:39.000
...and maybe even sent back to Mali.

1842
01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:41.630
You're being overdramatic.

1843
01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:43.540
No, I'm not.

1844
01:45:43.710 --> 01:45:47.300
Students who know him better
than any of us here...


1845
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:50.590
...who know his father,
say that he is likely...


1846
01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:53.550
...to send him back to Mali after this.

1847
01:45:55.140 --> 01:45:57.600
Some are threatened
with boarding school...


1848
01:45:57.770 --> 01:46:01.020
...but it never happens.

1849
01:46:01.650 --> 01:46:03.270
It can happen.

1850
01:46:03.730 --> 01:46:07.480
A lot of parents spend their time
threatening their kids...


1851
01:46:07.650 --> 01:46:09.400
...with that.

1852
01:46:09.570 --> 01:46:11.610
You can't take it into account.

1853
01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:14.990
Even if there was just a slight risk...

1854
01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:17.450
...that a hearing could lead...

1855
01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:21.420
...to him being sent back,
I don't think I can take that risk.


1856
01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:27.130
It's like when you hesitate...

1857
01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:31.470
...over punishing a kid
because when he goes home...


1858
01:46:31.630 --> 01:46:33.840
...once that door closes...

1859
01:46:34.050 --> 01:46:37.850
...he'll get a beating from his parents.
We've all seen that.


1860
01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:42.770
But we still have to punish them
when they go too far.


1861
01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:46.770
Whatever the consequences,
which don't concern you.


1862
01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:51.190
So I ignore that? I know punishment
can have such a consequence...


1863
01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:54.780
...but I turn a
blind eye, is that it?

1864
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:58.450
You can't take it into account
in every case.


1865
01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:01.370
The violence, him being sent back.

1866
01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:04.790
True, you have to consider it
but after a while...


1867
01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:07.460
No more Christmas presents.

1868
01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:11.470
It's a question of principle.

1869
01:47:11.630 --> 01:47:13.630
We each have a role to play.

1870
01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:17.100
We can't substitute ourselves
for the parents.


1871
01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:20.890
Sorry, but if I rewind the movie...

1872
01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:24.560
...it's a weird chain of events.
It starts with reprimands...


1873
01:47:24.730 --> 01:47:28.360
...when Souleymane forgets his things,
talks back.


1874
01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:30.900
We punish him. 
Again and again...

1875
01:47:31.110 --> 01:47:34.530
...until a disciplinary hearing
leading to who knows what.


1876
01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:38.240
Everything gets out of hand.

1877
01:47:38.410 --> 01:47:40.580
Sure, looking at it that way...

1878
01:47:40.750 --> 01:47:43.330
...it's really shocking.

1879
01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:47.830
But the school
won't be expelling Souleymane.


1880
01:47:48.250 --> 01:47:50.630
He's been gone for a while.

1881
01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:29.790
François.

1882
01:48:30.170 --> 01:48:32.670
I didn't expect you so soon.

1883
01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:35.590
Have you reached a decision?

1884
01:48:36.590 --> 01:48:39.050
I don't think I have much choice.

1885
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:50.270
By the way, Julie told me
you had a heated exchange...


1886
01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:52.320
...with two girls in your class.

1887
01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:56.490
Yes, the two class reps
but it happened first so...


1888
01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:59.570
You apparently called them skanks.

1889
01:48:59.950 --> 01:49:01.490
Let's say that, yes.

1890
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:04.160
That complicates things...

1891
01:49:04.330 --> 01:49:06.000
...but the problem remains.

1892
01:49:06.330 --> 01:49:09.170
I'd like you to mention it
in your report.


1893
01:49:09.330 --> 01:49:13.710
I don't want it used against us
at the disciplinary hearing.


1894
01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:17.260
Don't bother hiding it,
just write it down.


1895
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:18.510
I understand.

1896
01:49:20.850 --> 01:49:23.180
I'll let you reread this...

1897
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:25.720
...before we launch the procedure.

1898
01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:27.350
So I...

1899
01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:29.230
I just need to add...

1900
01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:31.860
Yes, without going into detail.

1901
01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:34.520
Does that suit you?

1902
01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:07.520
Can you take the minutes?

1903
01:50:26.290 --> 01:50:27.490
Please sit down.

1904
01:51:03.570 --> 01:51:05.450
"Carl tried to reason with him.

1905
01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:07.280
Souleymane broke free...

1906
01:51:07.450 --> 01:51:10.750
...swinging his bag that hit Khoumba
in the face.


1907
01:51:10.910 --> 01:51:14.080
He left, insulting everyone
and slamming the door.


1908
01:51:14.330 --> 01:51:17.460
I didn't go after him because
I needed to help Khoumba...


1909
01:51:17.630 --> 01:51:20.460
...whose eyebrow was bleeding."

1910
01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:25.090
Those are the facts
that led to today's hearing.


1911
01:51:25.390 --> 01:51:29.260
Madame, it doesn't mean
Souleymane is a bad boy.


1912
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:31.730
That's not what we're saying.

1913
01:51:31.890 --> 01:51:34.560
But, sometimes,
a student in a class...


1914
01:51:34.730 --> 01:51:38.570
...through voluntary
or involuntary behavior...


1915
01:51:38.730 --> 01:51:43.450
...can create an atmosphere that
prevents the class from working.


1916
01:51:58.460 --> 01:52:01.460
Do you understand
what we're saying?


1917
01:52:03.170 --> 01:52:05.760
If I may say something, it's true...

1918
01:52:05.930 --> 01:52:10.180
...there had been a number of signs
that should have warned us.


1919
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:12.430
We could have reacted sooner.

1920
01:52:13.890 --> 01:52:18.190
But now we have to deal
with an incident...


1921
01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:22.150
...that is fairly violent
and that's simply unacceptable.


1922
01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:26.400
I'd like to know
if you realize that, Souleymane?


1923
01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:33.870
We're not saying
you're deliberately violent.


1924
01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:38.920
The problem is you can't control
what you say and what you do.


1925
01:52:41.170 --> 01:52:43.510
Souleymane, we'd like to hear you.

1926
01:52:43.670 --> 01:52:47.180
You're here to express
your point of view. Go ahead.


1927
01:52:47.930 --> 01:52:51.010
I don't give a damn.
I've got nothing to say.


1928
01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:53.430
Do whatever you want to do.

1929
01:53:03.570 --> 01:53:04.690
Excuse me.

1930
01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:11.240
Monsieur, madame.

1931
01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:16.450
Can you translate?

1932
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:19.710
She says I'm a good boy.

1933
01:53:22.750 --> 01:53:23.960
I do my homework.

1934
01:53:30.510 --> 01:53:35.180
I help my brothers and sisters
with their work when I can.


1935
01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:45.230
I always wash the dishes
and help her when I can.


1936
01:53:47.780 --> 01:53:51.780
We don't doubt he's a good son.
That's not the problem.


1937
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:54.120
Let's consider his school record.

1938
01:53:54.290 --> 01:53:58.500
Excuse me, but could we focus
on the facts here?


1939
01:53:58.910 --> 01:54:01.540
Firstly, I'd like to say...

1940
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:06.300
...that we're surprised to see the
teacher involved in the incident...


1941
01:54:06.510 --> 01:54:08.050
...on this committee.

1942
01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:10.220
We find it highly irregular.

1943
01:54:10.630 --> 01:54:15.260
It's true. It's odd
to be both judge and litigant.


1944
01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:20.940
First of all, Mr. Marin was elected
to the administrative board...


1945
01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:23.440
...as the teachers' representative.

1946
01:54:23.610 --> 01:54:24.650
Moreover...

1947
01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:30.150
...I think that the incident
that occurred in Mr. Marin's class...


1948
01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:33.070
...doesn't involve
the teacher directly.


1949
01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:35.330
I'm sorry...

1950
01:54:35.530 --> 01:54:39.910
...you mention some harsh words
spoken by the teacher.


1951
01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:42.790
Apparently,
you used the word "skanks"...


1952
01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:45.750
...to describe the class reps.
And that's a problem.


1953
01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:47.300
I did say that...

1954
01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:50.670
...but it wasn't something
that concerned Souleymane.


1955
01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:55.970
I think he used the excuse
of a rather heated exchange...


1956
01:54:56.140 --> 01:55:00.480
...to express the bad mood
that he was in that day.


1957
01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:02.270
He tried to defend them.

1958
01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:04.440
So I feel that it's relevant.

1959
01:55:04.610 --> 01:55:08.440
Sorry, but absolutely nothing
justifies...


1960
01:55:08.610 --> 01:55:10.860
...being disrespectful to a teacher...

1961
01:55:11.070 --> 01:55:15.490
...insulting everyone and leaving
a class without permission.


1962
01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:20.580
Souleymane,
do you have anything to say?


1963
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:24.370
I don't know. What can I say?

1964
01:55:26.130 --> 01:55:27.590
Monsieur, madame.

1965
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:39.560
What did she say?

1966
01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:41.890
The same thing again.

1967
01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:57.620
She apologizes on my behalf.

1968
01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:05.180
You can come back in now.

1969
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:31.250
Madame, the committee
has conferred...


1970
01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:33.340
...and has decided
to expel Souleymane...


1971
01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:35.460
...from the school for good.

1972
01:57:35.630 --> 01:57:39.130
You will receive the ruling
by registered mail...


1973
01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:41.800
...and have eight days to appeal.

1974
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:54.020
We shall do our best
to find Souleymane another school.


1975
01:57:57.820 --> 01:57:59.740
Goodbye, messieurs, dames.

1976
01:58:03.370 --> 01:58:08.250
Souleymane, come to see me
before the end of the week, please.


1977
01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:42.570
Mathematical proportionality.

1978
01:58:44.070 --> 01:58:47.700
This year, you learned
mathematical proportionality.


1979
01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:49.080
All right.

1980
01:58:49.330 --> 01:58:50.870
I liked science.

1981
01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:53.420
What you learned,
not what you liked.


1982
01:58:53.580 --> 01:58:55.790
If you liked it, you learned.

1983
01:58:56.420 --> 01:58:58.300
So, what did you learn?

1984
01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:02.680
All about volcanoes, earthquakes...

1985
01:59:03.050 --> 01:59:04.090
...plates.

1986
01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:10.180
Convergence and divergence,
movement of the Earth's plates.


1987
01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:13.730
- It was fascinating.
- It interested you?


1988
01:59:13.900 --> 01:59:14.940
That's good.

1989
01:59:15.860 --> 01:59:17.770
Well, in mathematics...

1990
01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:19.440
Trigonometry.

1991
01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:22.110
Pythagoras' theorem,
Thales' theorem.


1992
01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:23.910
I'll stop you there.

1993
01:59:24.070 --> 01:59:26.450
You can't sit there and brag...

1994
01:59:26.620 --> 01:59:29.910
...you learned Pythagoras' theorem.
Recite it for us.


1995
01:59:33.750 --> 01:59:35.330
If in a triangle...

1996
01:59:38.550 --> 01:59:41.590
...two sides are equal to...

1997
01:59:42.090 --> 01:59:43.930
If the square root...

1998
01:59:44.090 --> 01:59:47.140
If the square of two sides
is equal to the square...


1999
01:59:48.060 --> 01:59:50.600
The square of the hypotenuse...

2000
01:59:50.770 --> 01:59:52.640
...then the triangle's a right triangle.

2001
01:59:53.730 --> 01:59:55.310
More or less, yes.

2002
01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:56.810
It's spot on.

2003
01:59:56.980 --> 01:59:58.110
All right.

2004
01:59:58.570 --> 02:00:00.070
I believe you.

2005
02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:03.320
In history,
I learned about triangular trade.


2006
02:00:03.490 --> 02:00:06.820
The fact that ships left Europe...

2007
02:00:06.990 --> 02:00:09.160
...with manufactured goods...

2008
02:00:09.370 --> 02:00:13.410
...that they took to Africa to trade
for men who'd become slaves...


2009
02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:16.290
...that they took to America to work.

2010
02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:19.960
Then they took the money
they made back to Europe.


2011
02:00:20.130 --> 02:00:22.090
That's triangular trade.

2012
02:00:23.010 --> 02:00:24.630
Chemistry.

2013
02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:26.130
What in chemistry?

2014
02:00:27.010 --> 02:00:28.800
Combustion.

2015
02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:30.350
What's that?

2016
02:00:30.510 --> 02:00:34.810
Blending Fehling's solution
and glucose.


2017
02:00:34.980 --> 02:00:36.310
What do you get?

2018
02:00:36.770 --> 02:00:39.440
Heat up the test tube...

2019
02:00:39.610 --> 02:00:41.400
...and it changes color.

2020
02:00:43.190 --> 02:00:44.780
What's the interest?

2021
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:46.110
The interest?

2022
02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:50.530
I don't know. Why teach it to us
if there's no interest?


2023
02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:53.410
Reproduction.

2024
02:00:55.290 --> 02:00:58.710
What did you learn
about human reproduction?


2025
02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.500
Human reproduction.

2026
02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:03.300
Well, the sperm...

2027
02:01:03.670 --> 02:01:05.210
...gets into the ovum...

2028
02:01:05.550 --> 02:01:07.170
...then you wait nine months...

2029
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:10.970
...then you do a sonogram
and then it comes out.


2030
02:01:11.850 --> 02:01:12.970
The sperm does?

2031
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:14.720
No, the baby.

2032
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:17.390
The human being that's inside.

2033
02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:19.850
- Khoumba?
- Me?


2034
02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:22.230
Yes. That is your name?

2035
02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:27.150
In music...

2036
02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:30.200
...I learned to play the alto recorder...

2037
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:32.870
...and in Spanish.

2038
02:01:33.370 --> 02:01:34.740
The recorder in Spanish?

2039
02:01:36.750 --> 02:01:39.920
No, in music,
I learned to play the alto recorder.


2040
02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:41.920
And other stuff in Spanish.

2041
02:01:42.090 --> 02:01:45.460
Very good. Can you say
something to us in Spanish?


2042
02:01:53.890 --> 02:01:54.930
And that means?

2043
02:01:55.100 --> 02:01:57.890
It's the vacation soon
or the vacation's coming.


2044
02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:03.230
I didn't learn anything.

2045
02:02:04.610 --> 02:02:08.990
You can't spend nine months at school
and not learn anything.


2046
02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:11.860
I'm the living proof.

2047
02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:14.870
You got something
from the books we read.


2048
02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:17.080
- Your books are shit.
- They're what?


2049
02:02:17.290 --> 02:02:18.500
They're useless.

2050
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:22.920
What about a book you read
by yourself?


2051
02:02:24.750 --> 02:02:26.300
The books I read?

2052
02:02:27.010 --> 02:02:29.300
Well, there's The Republic.

2053
02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:31.590
The book The Republic.

2054
02:02:33.550 --> 02:02:34.760
By Plato?

2055
02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:37.810
You read that?

2056
02:02:40.020 --> 02:02:41.140
How come?

2057
02:02:41.310 --> 02:02:44.230
My big sister had it.

2058
02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:45.820
She does philosophy?

2059
02:02:46.020 --> 02:02:47.270
No, law.

2060
02:02:48.150 --> 02:02:49.650
So, what's it about?

2061
02:02:50.610 --> 02:02:52.990
Well, there's this guy.

2062
02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:54.660
His name's Socrates.

2063
02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:55.910
Socrates.

2064
02:02:56.450 --> 02:03:01.330
He stops people in the street
and he asks them:


2065
02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:05.330
"Are you sure of thinking
what you think?


2066
02:03:05.540 --> 02:03:08.460
Are you sure of doing
what you do?" And so on.


2067
02:03:08.630 --> 02:03:11.760
After that,
people start getting confused.


2068
02:03:11.930 --> 02:03:13.550
They ask questions.

2069
02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:15.340
The guy's too much.

2070
02:03:15.970 --> 02:03:18.180
What does he ask people about?

2071
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:22.850
Everything. Love, religion, God...

2072
02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:25.270
...people, everything.

2073
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:28.070
- It's good you read it.
- I know.


2074
02:03:28.690 --> 02:03:30.690
It's not a skank's book.

2075
02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:37.780
Wait a second.

2076
02:03:37.950 --> 02:03:41.000
Before you leave,
here are your self-portraits.


2077
02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:44.370
One by one.
When you have yours, you can go.


2078
02:03:48.460 --> 02:03:51.130
This is kind of you.

2079
02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:52.630
What is it?

2080
02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:55.890
These are the self-portraits
that you wrote...


2081
02:03:56.090 --> 02:03:59.850
...and that we made up
with the class photo and so on.


2082
02:04:02.890 --> 02:04:04.100
You don't have one?

2083
02:04:06.980 --> 02:04:08.900
Why did you put this here?

2084
02:04:09.110 --> 02:04:11.610
- You look good in it.
- Cut it out.


2085
02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:13.860
You're like a leader.

2086
02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:21.660
- Have a good vacation.
- You too.


2087
02:04:28.420 --> 02:04:29.500
Sir?

2088
02:04:32.130 --> 02:04:33.260
What is it?

2089
02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:36.260
I didn't learn anything.

2090
02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:40.640
What? That doesn't mean anything.

2091
02:04:42.270 --> 02:04:44.350
Earlier, all the others...

2092
02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:47.730
...said they'd learned something.

2093
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:51.650
Compared to them, 
I learned nothing.

2094
02:04:55.150 --> 02:04:59.530
You learned as much as them.
They had to think hard too.


2095
02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:01.240
It's not easy...

2096
02:05:01.410 --> 02:05:04.700
...to remember what you learned.

2097
02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:06.660
But I don't understand.

2098
02:05:07.790 --> 02:05:08.960
What do you mean?

2099
02:05:09.670 --> 02:05:11.750
I don't understand what we do.

2100
02:05:12.380 --> 02:05:13.420
In French?

2101
02:05:14.670 --> 02:05:15.800
In everything.

2102
02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:21.970
You can't say you don't understand
anything in any subject.


2103
02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:24.770
That's not true.

2104
02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:30.400
I don't want to go
to vocational school.


2105
02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:33.820
There's no question of that yet.

2106
02:05:34.730 --> 02:05:36.990
You're moving on to the next year.

2107
02:05:37.570 --> 02:05:41.820
You'll have plenty of time
to think about your future.


2108
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:45.290
Vocational school
isn't an absolute certainty.


2109
02:05:45.450 --> 02:05:48.080
It all depends
on how you do next year.


2110
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:51.080
But I don't want to.
