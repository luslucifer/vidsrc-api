00:00:48.351 --> 00:00:50.810
<i>Though many know</i>
<i>the tragic love story</i>


2
00:00:50.893 --> 00:00:52.601
<i>of Antony and Cleopatra,</i>

3
00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.685
<i>the wayward Roman general</i>

4
00:00:54.768 --> 00:00:57.893
<i>who fell madly in love</i>
<i>with the enchanting Egyptian queen,</i>


5
00:00:57.976 --> 00:00:59.976
<i>both of them taking their lives</i>

6
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.143
<i>rather than face a world</i>
<i>without each other,</i>


7
00:01:03.226 --> 00:01:05.101
<i>few know the secret story</i>

8
00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:09.560
<i>of the most sought-after prize</i>
<i>and unsolved puzzle of their time.</i>


9
00:01:09.643 --> 00:01:12.685
<i>The mystery of Cleopatra's third egg.</i>

10
00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:17.601
<i>On their wedding day,</i>
<i>as a symbol of his undying devotion,</i>


11
00:01:17.685 --> 00:01:21.685
<i>Mark Antony presented Cleopatra</i>
<i>with three bejeweled eggs,</i>


12
00:01:21.768 --> 00:01:24.226
<i>each one more exquisite than the last.</i>

13
00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:29.810
<i>For centuries, these eggs were thought</i>
<i>to be nothing more than myth, rumor.</i>


14
00:01:29.893 --> 00:01:32.101
<i>But then, in 1907,</i>

15
00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:36.685
<i>just outside of Cairo,</i>
<i>a local farmer unearthed two of them.</i>


16
00:01:37.268 --> 00:01:39.893
<i>Some say the third egg was never found.</i>

17
00:01:39.976 --> 00:01:41.768
<i>Others claim it was discovered,</i>

18
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:45.851
<i>but just as quickly lost,</i>
<i>never to be seen again.</i>


19
00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:49.226
<i>Join us as we explore that very question.</i>

20
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.851
<i>What happened to Cleopatra's lost egg?</i>

21
00:01:51.935 --> 00:01:53.893
<i>Who may hold it in their possession?</i>

22
00:01:53.976 --> 00:01:56.976
<i>And most importantly,</i>
<i>will we ever see the day in which</i>


23
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.268
<i>all three eggs are reunited</i>
<i>for the first time in over 2,000 years?</i>


24
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:06.435
<i>Cleopatra's first egg</i>
<i>is on display for all to see</i>


25
00:02:06.518 --> 00:02:10.393
<i>at the world-famous Museo Nazionale</i>
<i>di Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome.</i>


26
00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:13.935
<i>The second egg has been</i>
<i>sold at auction numerous times</i>


27
00:02:14.018 --> 00:02:16.435
<i>and currently is held</i>
<i>in a private collection.</i>


28
00:04:16.351 --> 00:04:17.435
You're not a cop.

29
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.101
You're right, I'm not.

30
00:04:19.185 --> 00:04:21.560
You know what I mean, Agent.
Your badge is no good here.


31
00:04:21.643 --> 00:04:23.268
So no American cowboy stuff.

32
00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:25.143
Don't worry. Left my chaps at home.

33
00:04:25.685 --> 00:04:26.685
You sure about this?

34
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.601
I know how he thinks.
He's gonna do it today. Trust me.


35
00:04:30.685 --> 00:04:32.101
All right, then, here we go.

36
00:04:37.851 --> 00:04:39.726
- Impossible.
- I'm not asking.


37
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.226
You need to shut the museum down,
evacuate your visitors,


38
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.518
and seal all ingress
and egress points immediately.


39
00:04:44.601 --> 00:04:47.060
And Interpol has the authority
to compel me to do so?


40
00:04:47.143 --> 00:04:48.560
Don't test me, Director.

41
00:04:48.643 --> 00:04:49.685
You should listen to her.

42
00:04:49.768 --> 00:04:51.268
And who are you? 
Her bodyguard?

43
00:04:51.351 --> 00:04:54.851
This is Special Agent John Hartley
of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit.


44
00:04:54.935 --> 00:04:57.851
He's a consulting profiler
who specializes in art crime.


45
00:04:58.893 --> 00:05:00.226
You don't look like a profiler.

46
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.018
Yeah, I get that a lot.

47
00:05:03.601 --> 00:05:06.601
Forty-one hours ago, Agent Hartley
received credible intelligence that


48
00:05:06.685 --> 00:05:10.060
the most wanted art thief in the world,
a man named Nolan Booth,


49
00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.643
intends to steal
the Egg of Cleopatra today.


50
00:05:13.976 --> 00:05:15.810
Who provided you this information?

51
00:05:15.893 --> 00:05:16.893
The Bishop.

52
00:05:16.976 --> 00:05:18.518
You cannot be serious.

53
00:05:19.018 --> 00:05:23.185
My dear, The Bishop is nothing more
than a boogeyman story in the art world.


54
00:05:23.268 --> 00:05:25.310
It's a catch-all concept.
It's someone to blame


55
00:05:25.393 --> 00:05:27.101
when you and your friends
in law enforcement


56
00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:29.601
are too incompetent to solve the case.

57
00:05:29.685 --> 00:05:33.268
Listen to me, unless we stop it,
that egg is gonna be stolen today.


58
00:05:33.351 --> 00:05:35.060
In fact, it may already be gone.

59
00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:53.476
Already gone, you say?

60
00:05:54.643 --> 00:05:58.893
Now, if you'll excuse me, Inspector,
I believe I owe your supervisor a call.


61
00:06:01.935 --> 00:06:04.060
Do you have thermal sensors in this room?

62
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:08.101
- Of course we do.
- Show it to me.


63
00:06:17.435 --> 00:06:18.893
You're wasting our time.

64
00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:21.768
What, may I ask, are you looking for?

65
00:06:21.851 --> 00:06:25.393
Well, you see, Cleopatra's first egg
is covered in 18-karat gold.


66
00:06:25.476 --> 00:06:26.976
And gold reflects radiation.

67
00:06:27.726 --> 00:06:30.018
That egg should be
reflecting the heat in this room.


68
00:06:30.101 --> 00:06:31.893
It should be red, not blue.

69
00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:35.601
It's probably just an error
in the thermal sensor.


70
00:06:35.685 --> 00:06:37.560
Well, there's only one way to find out.

71
00:06:42.893 --> 00:06:46.643
Hey, sorry, big man, but there's
no food or drink in the museum.


72
00:06:49.726 --> 00:06:50.601
Thank you.

73
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.143
No, no, wait a moment.
What do you think you're doing?


74
00:06:55.226 --> 00:06:58.143
Relax, it's fine.
He knows what he's doing.


75
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.726
Seal the room. Now!

76
00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:33.143
Move! Move!

77
00:07:34.185 --> 00:07:35.643
He's heading for the exit.

78
00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:57.935
Oh.

79
00:08:04.893 --> 00:08:06.018
Freeze!

80
00:08:51.101 --> 00:08:53.101
He is here.
Send reinforcements.


81
00:09:26.435 --> 00:09:27.476
He's on the scaffolding.

82
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.435
We're gonna need more--

83
00:10:17.518 --> 00:10:20.518
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Ah.


84
00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:23.268
Jesus,
you scared me.


85
00:10:24.726 --> 00:10:27.893
I know you. You're the… You're the slow
bald guy that's been chasing me.


86
00:10:27.976 --> 00:10:29.351
What do you got in the bag?

87
00:10:30.101 --> 00:10:32.185
You're American. 
What brings you to Rome?

88
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.060
Gelato, the Colosseum.

89
00:10:35.143 --> 00:10:36.851
- Oh, it's beautiful. Beautiful place.
- Yeah.


90
00:10:36.935 --> 00:10:38.893
- First time?
- Yep.


91
00:10:38.976 --> 00:10:42.643
That was a fun foot chase, right?
Lots of twists and turns. Hijinks.


92
00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:43.935
Who knew it'd end up like this?

93
00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:45.893
- I did.
- Right.


94
00:10:45.976 --> 00:10:48.810
Fun's over, Nolan Booth.
Give me the bag, turn around,


95
00:10:48.893 --> 00:10:50.893
put your hands behind your back.
You're under arrest.


96
00:10:50.976 --> 00:10:53.935
Okay. Well, hold on one sec.
I just have two questions.


97
00:10:54.018 --> 00:10:55.518
Okay. Um…

98
00:10:55.601 --> 00:10:58.185
First question,
where'd you get that jacket?


99
00:10:58.268 --> 00:10:59.518
It's a statement piece.

100
00:11:00.018 --> 00:11:02.976
Somewhere there is a very nude cow
whispering…


101
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.018
…"Worth it."

102
00:11:04.601 --> 00:11:07.601
And number two, on the whole
arresting me thing, I totally get it.


103
00:11:07.685 --> 00:11:10.268
You know, baby did
a bad, bad thing. Yeah.

104
00:11:10.351 --> 00:11:13.310
But you don't happen to have,
like, a badge or somethin'


105
00:11:13.393 --> 00:11:15.851
tucked away in the turtleneck, do you?

106
00:11:16.476 --> 00:11:18.768
I don't need to show you my badge
because I've got a gun.


107
00:11:18.851 --> 00:11:20.810
Here's the thing.
You're putting me in a pickle.


108
00:11:20.893 --> 00:11:22.851
Without identification,
how do I know who you are?


109
00:11:22.935 --> 00:11:24.726
For all I know, you
could be the bad guy,

110
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.351
and I could be the other bad guy.

111
00:11:29.143 --> 00:11:30.935
You're right. I am the bad guy.

112
00:11:31.018 --> 00:11:33.810
Now shut up and give me the bag
before I shoot you in the mouth.


113
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.143
- I'm gonna give this to you.
- Good.


114
00:11:36.643 --> 00:11:39.810
Yeah, I'm just gonna give it to you
'cause I don't even want it.


115
00:11:39.893 --> 00:11:41.810
For the record, none of this feels good.

116
00:11:41.893 --> 00:11:43.060
Booth, don't move!

117
00:12:00.143 --> 00:12:01.476
Whoa!

118
00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:08.101
Come on, let's go.

119
00:12:42.351 --> 00:12:43.851
What the hell?

120
00:12:49.643 --> 00:12:50.601
Where are you going?

121
00:12:50.685 --> 00:12:51.685
Asshole!

122
00:12:54.893 --> 00:12:56.560
Can you hold on to this for me?

123
00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.310
- Thanks.

124
00:13:26.435 --> 00:13:28.435
What the hell?
You idiot! Are you blind?


125
00:13:40.893 --> 00:13:44.143
126

127
00:14:54.601 --> 00:14:58.268
Special Agent John Hartley, FBI.
We met earlier.


128
00:14:58.893 --> 00:15:02.435
Aren't you a little outside
your jurisdiction?


129
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:04.143
I am.

130
00:15:06.601 --> 00:15:07.851
Good thing these guys aren't.

131
00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:13.643
Wow!

132
00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.726
Hi, guys.
Don't take your shoes off or anything.


133
00:15:20.976 --> 00:15:22.268
You sure you brought enough guns?

134
00:15:22.351 --> 00:15:24.310
What can I say? 
I like to be thorough.

135
00:15:24.976 --> 00:15:27.101
No way, José.

136
00:15:27.185 --> 00:15:30.851
- The intrepid Inspector Das.

137
00:15:30.935 --> 00:15:34.435
I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
I'll take that. Thank you.


138
00:15:34.518 --> 00:15:36.893
- It's nice to meet a fan.
- Oh, that's cute.


139
00:15:36.976 --> 00:15:38.643
You wanna know what else is cute?

140
00:15:38.726 --> 00:15:40.810
Because you're wanted
in 18 separate countries,


141
00:15:40.893 --> 00:15:43.143
I get to choose which one of them
detains you until trial,


142
00:15:43.226 --> 00:15:44.643
given your escape history.

143
00:15:44.726 --> 00:15:45.893
What are you, six for six now?

144
00:15:45.976 --> 00:15:48.060
Yeah. One more
and I get a Shawshank jacket.


145
00:15:48.143 --> 00:15:49.018
Keep making your jokes

146
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:51.476
because I'm about to send you
to the worst place in the world.


147
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.768
Your Instagram account?

148
00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:55.935
You know,
I'm really starting to not like you.


149
00:15:56.018 --> 00:15:57.226
Oh, come on!

150
00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.643
Not like me? You don't even know me.

151
00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:01.851
We could have a lot in common.

152
00:16:01.935 --> 00:16:05.685
Maybe I don't know you,
but I've been building a profile on you,


153
00:16:05.768 --> 00:16:08.685
ever since you stole William Strang's
<i>Lady with a Red Hat</i>from the Tate


154
00:16:08.768 --> 00:16:10.018
back in 2014.

155
00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:11.435
You can't prove that was me.

156
00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:18.476
I got that on Etsy.

157
00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.685
I've been tracking
your scores for a while.


158
00:16:22.768 --> 00:16:25.101
So let me take a crack
at who I think you really are.


159
00:16:25.935 --> 00:16:26.976
Sure thing. Yeah.

160
00:16:28.143 --> 00:16:29.393
- Only child.
- Mmm-hmm.


161
00:16:29.476 --> 00:16:32.435
Dad's a Swiss cop,
Mom's an American professor.


162
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.768
You started stealing
between the ages of six and eight.


163
00:16:37.935 --> 00:16:39.851
You found out
you had a real talent for it.


164
00:16:39.935 --> 00:16:41.810
It made you feel special, different.

165
00:16:41.893 --> 00:16:44.643
You like to work alone.
You don't like a team.


166
00:16:44.726 --> 00:16:47.768
The only jobs you take are the ones
that make the big, splashy headlines,


167
00:16:47.851 --> 00:16:51.893
which tells me that you only do it
for the thrill and not the money.


168
00:16:51.976 --> 00:16:54.518
Are you insane? 
I love the money.

169
00:16:55.435 --> 00:16:58.810
I'm not done yet.
I'm just getting to the good part.


170
00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:00.268
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


171
00:17:00.351 --> 00:17:03.310
A lot of thieves out there
who claim to only do it for the money.


172
00:17:03.393 --> 00:17:04.685
That's not unusual.

173
00:17:05.268 --> 00:17:08.435
But what is unusual
is the risk that you take.


174
00:17:09.226 --> 00:17:10.310
The chances.

175
00:17:11.226 --> 00:17:15.976
It's as though you wanna get caught
so you can escape,


176
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.851
just to prove yourself all over again,

177
00:17:17.935 --> 00:17:20.476
and prove that
you're better than everybody else


178
00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.893
and that you're worthy.

179
00:17:22.976 --> 00:17:24.643
Worthy of what? This speech?

180
00:17:24.726 --> 00:17:26.101
Your father's love.

181
00:17:36.476 --> 00:17:37.810
Congratulations.

182
00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.518
How'd you find me?

183
00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:43.768
Well, the same way I knew that
you were gonna steal the egg in Rome.


184
00:17:45.685 --> 00:17:46.976
The Bishop.

185
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.226
The Bishop.

186
00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:50.935
Get him ready to move.

187
00:18:08.143 --> 00:18:09.101
Booth, I'm curious.

188
00:18:09.185 --> 00:18:12.851
How does it feel to be sold out
by the most wanted art thief in the world?


189
00:18:13.351 --> 00:18:15.560
I'm the most wanted art thief
in the world.


190
00:18:16.851 --> 00:18:17.768
You were.

191
00:18:18.976 --> 00:18:20.351
Wait. Wait here.

192
00:18:23.851 --> 00:18:26.560
There's no chance I'm putting
that thing in the same van as him.


193
00:18:29.893 --> 00:18:32.226
- See you at the airfield.
- I'll see you there.


194
00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.893
Door open.

195
00:19:34.643 --> 00:19:35.893
All right. We're good.

196
00:19:53.393 --> 00:19:54.685
Thank you.

197
00:20:01.268 --> 00:20:02.101
Hi, there.

198
00:20:06.518 --> 00:20:08.518
- You leaving town?
- Flight's in an hour.


199
00:20:08.601 --> 00:20:09.685
Something up?

200
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.476
You could say that. Hmm.

201
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.060
Okay. What's going on?

202
00:20:14.143 --> 00:20:16.435
Funny,
I was gonna ask you the same thing.


203
00:20:25.018 --> 00:20:26.143
What are you doing with that?

204
00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:32.185
Oh, this priceless piece
of ancient cultural whatnot?


205
00:20:38.268 --> 00:20:39.643
Oops!

206
00:20:39.726 --> 00:20:41.226
Booth gave us a fake egg.

207
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.560
I'll admit,
Booth was my first thought too.


208
00:20:43.643 --> 00:20:45.810
Then I asked myself,
"How well do you really know someone


209
00:20:45.893 --> 00:20:47.768
you only met 72 hours ago?"

210
00:20:47.851 --> 00:20:49.518
And someone whose official credentials

211
00:20:49.601 --> 00:20:52.143
came solely by
a written interagency communiqué.


212
00:20:52.226 --> 00:20:57.935
So I called up the Assistant Director
of the BAU at Quantico, really nice lady.


213
00:20:58.018 --> 00:20:59.143
She'd never heard of you.

214
00:20:59.226 --> 00:21:00.768
- That's impossible.
- Is it?


215
00:21:00.851 --> 00:21:01.935
Yes, it's impossible.

216
00:21:02.018 --> 00:21:04.226
As impossible as a John Hartley
with a Swiss bank account


217
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.518
that received an $8 million wire transfer

218
00:21:06.601 --> 00:21:09.560
from an encrypted third-party
on the same day the egg was stolen?


219
00:21:09.643 --> 00:21:12.935
Quite a coincidence,
wouldn't you say, Agent?


220
00:21:16.935 --> 00:21:19.018
<i>We have eyes on target.</i>

221
00:21:19.101 --> 00:21:22.935
Listen, whatever you think this is,
whatever you think I did, I didn't do.


222
00:21:23.518 --> 00:21:26.393
Someone's behind this.
The Bishop, maybe even Booth himself.


223
00:21:26.476 --> 00:21:28.518
- I'm being set up.
- Maybe you are, maybe you're not.


224
00:21:28.601 --> 00:21:31.018
Until I figure it out,
I'm gonna keep you where I can find you.


225
00:21:31.101 --> 00:21:34.476
Now, normally,
I'm not a vindictive person, but,


226
00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.310
well, I trusted you
and you hurt my feelings.


227
00:21:37.893 --> 00:21:39.518
So I picked someplace extra special.

228
00:21:39.601 --> 00:21:42.560
It's a bit of a black site.
Kind of the land due process forgot.


229
00:21:43.143 --> 00:21:44.810
You're under arrest, 
Agent Hartley.

230
00:21:44.893 --> 00:21:47.143
Das, look at me. 
Look at my eyes.

231
00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:51.851
I didn't do this.

232
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.768
I don't believe you.

233
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.351
You a top or a bottom?

234
00:22:57.435 --> 00:23:00.560
Doesn't matter.
Prison's gonna decide for us.


235
00:23:00.643 --> 00:23:01.893
You gotta be shittin' me.

236
00:23:01.976 --> 00:23:04.643
Well, I'll say one thing
about ol' Inspector Das,


237
00:23:04.726 --> 00:23:06.018
she's got a real sense of humor.

238
00:23:06.518 --> 00:23:07.893
Put 'er there, roomie.

239
00:23:09.851 --> 00:23:11.768
You're right, we should wash up first.

240
00:23:11.851 --> 00:23:13.768
It's okay. You're safe here.

241
00:23:15.601 --> 00:23:19.726
Except if they find out you're a cop.
Then they're gonna wanna kill you.


242
00:23:28.268 --> 00:23:31.185
Bishop must have seen you
coming from a mile away.


243
00:23:31.268 --> 00:23:33.185
Got your trust after selling me out.

244
00:23:33.268 --> 00:23:36.601
Can't run a con without gaining
the mark's trust first, that's page one.


245
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:39.560
I know how a confidence scheme works,
trust me.


246
00:23:39.643 --> 00:23:41.726
Well, you do now, that's for sure.

247
00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:45.060
The same mystery thief who ratted me out
is the same one who framed you.


248
00:23:45.143 --> 00:23:47.018
That seems like a coincidence,
don't you think?


249
00:23:47.601 --> 00:23:50.143
This is not a coincidence. 
This is a plan.

250
00:23:50.768 --> 00:23:54.226
In one move, The Bishop took out
her lead competitor and lead investigator.


251
00:23:54.976 --> 00:23:56.601
- Two birds, one stone.
- Egg.


252
00:23:56.685 --> 00:23:59.101
- What?
- Two birds, one egg.


253
00:23:59.185 --> 00:24:01.685
It's kind of a lay-up.
Even Post Malone gets it.


254
00:24:02.351 --> 00:24:04.851
This is farm-to-table, right? Thank you.

255
00:24:04.935 --> 00:24:06.560
I don't understand why.

256
00:24:06.643 --> 00:24:09.810
Why would The Bishop go to the trouble of
framing me when she already has the egg?


257
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.226
I mean, what's left?

258
00:24:12.726 --> 00:24:14.226
Three hundred million dollars?

259
00:24:14.851 --> 00:24:17.018
You're kidding.
I never heard of a price tag like that.


260
00:24:17.101 --> 00:24:18.018
No one has.

261
00:24:18.101 --> 00:24:21.060
But you don't understand,
that's not the price for just one egg.


262
00:24:21.643 --> 00:24:22.810
Here's the deal.

263
00:24:22.893 --> 00:24:26.435
Whoever brings
this Egyptian billionaire all three eggs


264
00:24:26.518 --> 00:24:30.643
by the night of his daughter's wedding
gets all the marbles.


265
00:24:30.726 --> 00:24:34.018
Turns out,
Mr. Big Daddy Big Bucks' daughter,


266
00:24:34.101 --> 00:24:35.226
guess what her name is?

267
00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.726
Stop guessing, it's Cleopatra.

268
00:24:37.393 --> 00:24:41.518
I mean, these people are horrible.
But I like money, so…


269
00:24:42.101 --> 00:24:43.268
So how does that work?

270
00:24:43.851 --> 00:24:46.518
No one knows where the third egg is.
It's never been found.


271
00:24:46.601 --> 00:24:49.893
I'm not gonna lie,
that's a bit of a problem.


272
00:24:49.976 --> 00:24:52.018
I was gonna deal with
the second egg first.


273
00:24:52.101 --> 00:24:53.393
Then the rest.

274
00:24:53.476 --> 00:24:56.726
All right, well,
Bureau intel says that the second egg


275
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:58.518
is owned by an international arms dealer.

276
00:24:58.601 --> 00:25:00.310
Sotto Voce. I know all about this guy.

277
00:25:00.393 --> 00:25:02.726
His dad tried to strangle him
when he was 14.


278
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:05.101
Nobody can stand
this son of a bitch.


279
00:25:06.143 --> 00:25:08.185
<i>Apparently, it left</i>
<i>quite the impression on him.</i>


280
00:25:08.268 --> 00:25:11.560
<i>And strangling folks</i>
<i>became sort of a hobby for him.</i>


281
00:25:12.268 --> 00:25:13.351
<i>He's a big fan.</i>

282
00:25:14.768 --> 00:25:17.101
<i>Sotto Voce is super scary.</i>

283
00:25:17.185 --> 00:25:18.726
<i>But he's not above having a good time.</i>

284
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:22.060
<i>Throws a masquerade party every year</i>
<i>for his top buyers</i>


285
00:25:22.143 --> 00:25:25.268
<i>in his I-probably-have-a-tiny-penis villa</i>
<i>in Valencia.</i>


286
00:25:25.351 --> 00:25:27.560
<i>Gunrunners are a little touchy</i>
<i>about their identity.</i>


287
00:25:27.643 --> 00:25:31.018
<i>So the</i>Eyes Wide Shut <i>thing</i>
<i>takes the edge off for everyone.</i>


288
00:25:31.101 --> 00:25:34.060
<i>Now, what none of these</i>
<i>evil one-percenters know</i>


289
00:25:34.143 --> 00:25:36.643
<i>is that upstairs,</i>
<i>locked away in a secret vault,</i>


290
00:25:36.726 --> 00:25:39.518
<i>Dr. Shirtless has in his possession</i>

291
00:25:39.601 --> 00:25:42.435
<i>an ancient piece of pricelessness</i>
<i>that I like to call…</i>


292
00:25:43.643 --> 00:25:45.601
<i>Cleopatra's second egg.</i>

293
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:49.935
And it's just begging
for me to steal it.

294
00:25:50.018 --> 00:25:52.768
I'd be on my way there right now
if you weren't such a super cop.


295
00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.060
- Don't do that.
- What?


296
00:25:56.143 --> 00:25:57.768
- Don't do that.
- Do what?


297
00:25:57.851 --> 00:26:01.476
- I know what you're doing. Listen.
- I'm not doing anything.


298
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.810
These guys here,
if they find out you're a C-O-P…


299
00:26:04.893 --> 00:26:08.310
This is a room full of convicted murderers
and toilet vodka enthusiasts.


300
00:26:08.393 --> 00:26:10.476
We gotta make sure
they know you're not a cop.


301
00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.851
- <i>Nyet politsiya.</i>
- Listen to me. I beg…


302
00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.018
Guys? <i>Nyet politsiya.</i>Not a cop.

303
00:26:18.101 --> 00:26:21.518
This man is not a cop, all right?

304
00:26:21.601 --> 00:26:23.685
Get that through
your thick skulls right now!


305
00:26:23.768 --> 00:26:26.435
He's a profiler for the FBI,

306
00:26:26.518 --> 00:26:30.476
which does fall under the umbrella
of law enforcement, but not a cop.


307
00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.976
It's similar, but it's not the same thing.
It's a complicated backstory.


308
00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.726
This is our good friend,
Special Agent John Hartley.


309
00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:39.268
Let's give him a warm welcome
to the prison, guys.


310
00:26:44.935 --> 00:26:48.060
Thank you, guys.
I don't think anyone heard me. We're good.


311
00:26:48.143 --> 00:26:49.893
All's quiet on the western front.

312
00:26:49.976 --> 00:26:52.226
- Nobody's… Oh, no.

313
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:55.435
Yep.
Drago Grande heard. Here he comes.


314
00:26:57.393 --> 00:26:59.351
Okay, be cool.
Don't embarrass me.


315
00:27:02.685 --> 00:27:04.018
Hello, sir.

316
00:27:05.351 --> 00:27:06.560
<i>Politsiya.</i>

317
00:27:08.351 --> 00:27:09.435
You die.

318
00:27:09.518 --> 00:27:11.185
Okay, he knows.

319
00:27:11.893 --> 00:27:13.185
He knows you're a cop.

320
00:27:13.768 --> 00:27:14.851
The jig is up.

321
00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.143
It's okay.

322
00:27:27.351 --> 00:27:28.435
You can…

323
00:27:28.935 --> 00:27:31.518
You can have mine.
You need some nourishment.


324
00:27:36.976 --> 00:27:40.060
You should get up.
You look like a little bitch right now.


325
00:27:40.143 --> 00:27:41.476
I say that as a friend.

326
00:27:46.101 --> 00:27:47.018
Okay, look.

327
00:27:47.685 --> 00:27:50.143
I don't wanna do
the whole prison fight thing with you…


328
00:27:50.226 --> 00:27:54.435
- You got this. I'm in your corner.
- So please, no fight.


329
00:27:54.518 --> 00:27:56.810
Let's just go back and finish our meals.

330
00:28:11.476 --> 00:28:13.768
- No. No--
- Back to your cell!


331
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:16.018
God…

332
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.518
All that working out.

333
00:28:19.101 --> 00:28:21.810
You still get your ass spanked
by a toothless man with tuberculosis--


334
00:28:21.893 --> 00:28:24.018
Okay. Okay.

335
00:28:24.101 --> 00:28:27.143
If you ever pull shit like that again,
it'll be the last thing you do.


336
00:28:27.226 --> 00:28:28.310
Right.

337
00:28:28.393 --> 00:28:30.685
- You don't know me, Booth.
- No.


338
00:28:30.768 --> 00:28:32.351
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

339
00:28:32.435 --> 00:28:34.476
Okay. Thank God, you're here.

340
00:28:35.851 --> 00:28:37.810
The captain wants to see you.

341
00:28:37.893 --> 00:28:38.726
Let's go!

342
00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:39.935
Him?

343
00:28:40.018 --> 00:28:41.643
Oh, no, us. Okay.

344
00:28:53.643 --> 00:28:54.768
Hello, boys.

345
00:28:55.518 --> 00:28:56.685
Oh, my God.

346
00:28:56.768 --> 00:28:57.851
Wow.

347
00:28:58.851 --> 00:29:00.310
You're the captain?

348
00:29:00.393 --> 00:29:03.310
You might benefit
from a little career change.


349
00:29:03.393 --> 00:29:05.268
I mean, I'm… I don't think runway,

350
00:29:05.351 --> 00:29:08.310
but definitely
regional catalog work, fliers…


351
00:29:08.393 --> 00:29:09.393
She's The Bishop.

352
00:29:09.476 --> 00:29:12.018
No shit, dipdick!

353
00:29:12.101 --> 00:29:15.268
It's so nice to finally meet you,
Mr. Booth.


354
00:29:15.351 --> 00:29:17.976
Such a thrill to be face-to-face

355
00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.476
with the second-best art thief
in the world.


356
00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.935
Oh, I see what you did there.
That's…


357
00:29:25.018 --> 00:29:28.143
Yeah, you got lucky
a couple of times early on, you know?


358
00:29:28.226 --> 00:29:31.310
But you can't name one time
in the past year that you beat me.


359
00:29:31.393 --> 00:29:33.101
- Helsinki.
- My parachute failed.


360
00:29:33.185 --> 00:29:34.101
Jakarta.

361
00:29:34.185 --> 00:29:36.226
- My Segway sank.
- Macau.


362
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:38.268
Nobody knew that Miley Cyrus
was going to be there.


363
00:29:38.351 --> 00:29:39.976
It was a completely unannounced show.

364
00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.935
You can have excuses or results.

365
00:29:43.018 --> 00:29:44.685
- Not both.

366
00:29:44.768 --> 00:29:46.851
What are we doing here? 
What do you want?

367
00:29:46.935 --> 00:29:48.810
To have a chat.

368
00:29:48.893 --> 00:29:50.226
First of all, Agent Hartley,

369
00:29:50.351 --> 00:29:54.101
please accept my sincerest apologies
for the whole mix-up in Rome.


370
00:29:54.185 --> 00:29:56.726
<i>You see, after I
stole the egg in Bali,</i>

371
00:29:56.810 --> 00:30:02.018
<i>I then made an $8 million deposit</i>
<i>into an account registered in your name.</i>


372
00:30:02.685 --> 00:30:06.976
<i>Then, all I had to do was sit back</i>
<i>and wait for Das to take the bait.</i>


373
00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:12.601
<i>A few clever keystrokes</i>
<i>and a well-timed call intercept.</i>


374
00:30:12.685 --> 00:30:14.851
<i>FBI BAU Director's office.</i>

375
00:30:14.935 --> 00:30:17.018
And poof.

376
00:30:17.101 --> 00:30:19.393
Bye-bye, Agent John Hartley.

377
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:22.643
Hello, suspicious suspect.

378
00:30:22.726 --> 00:30:24.393
Funny, don't you think?

379
00:30:26.268 --> 00:30:28.143
Shut up. You deleted my life.

380
00:30:28.226 --> 00:30:30.268
And now I'm stuck in a cell
with this idiot.


381
00:30:31.351 --> 00:30:34.101
Well, down to business then.

382
00:30:34.185 --> 00:30:36.810
At the risk of stating the obvious,

383
00:30:37.393 --> 00:30:39.435
I have the first egg in my possession,

384
00:30:39.518 --> 00:30:43.726
and in less than 48 hours,
I'm gonna have the second one as well.


385
00:30:45.101 --> 00:30:49.476
But that leaves an issue. 
The final egg.

386
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.060
Well, too bad for you.
Nobody knows where the third egg is.


387
00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:54.226
He didn't tell you?

388
00:30:54.851 --> 00:30:56.185
You didn't tell him?

389
00:30:56.851 --> 00:30:59.060
- Didn't tell me what?
- I don't know what she's talking about.


390
00:30:59.143 --> 00:31:01.518
Your cellmate here
knows exactly where the third egg is.


391
00:31:01.601 --> 00:31:04.893
She's lying. I do not know
where the third egg is. I swear to God.


392
00:31:05.935 --> 00:31:08.268
<i>I know where the third egg is.</i>
<i>I swear to God.</i>


393
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:12.351
Yes, that is me. Scratch that.
That was me. I did say that.


394
00:31:12.435 --> 00:31:14.685
When were you gonna tell me
about the third egg?


395
00:31:14.768 --> 00:31:18.060
I was never gonna tell you
about the third egg because you're a cop.


396
00:31:18.143 --> 00:31:20.518
My offer to you, Mr. 
Booth, is this.

397
00:31:20.601 --> 00:31:24.810
Tell me where the third egg is,
I'll get you out of here and give you 10%.


398
00:31:24.893 --> 00:31:26.101
Rock-hard pass.

399
00:31:26.185 --> 00:31:28.185
I'm sorry we couldn't do business.

400
00:31:28.976 --> 00:31:31.226
Well, perhaps a few more days in here

401
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:35.185
with the prospect
of thousands more to come


402
00:31:36.101 --> 00:31:37.935
will help change your mind.

403
00:31:38.893 --> 00:31:40.976
I'll stop by once
I have the second egg.

404
00:31:41.476 --> 00:31:44.685
Oh, and when I do,
the offer's gonna be 5%.


405
00:31:44.768 --> 00:31:48.351
Thank you, Captain.
Labor detail for them both.


406
00:31:49.893 --> 00:31:52.685
Bye. Don't miss me too much.

407
00:31:52.768 --> 00:31:53.976
Ta-ta!

408
00:31:56.476 --> 00:31:58.143
Oh, hey, guys. Okay!

409
00:31:59.185 --> 00:32:01.018
If we work together to catch her,

410
00:32:01.101 --> 00:32:03.393
I can do things
to The Bishop you can't do.


411
00:32:03.476 --> 00:32:05.060
There's no need to be disgusting.

412
00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.976
Here we go. Three, two, one.
Lift with your neck.


413
00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:14.310
I mean put her in prison. For life.

414
00:32:15.185 --> 00:32:18.685
When that happens, guess who becomes
number one art thief in the world again?


415
00:32:20.726 --> 00:32:23.768
Teamwork? It feels weird in my mouth.

416
00:32:23.851 --> 00:32:24.935
Are you carrying your side?

417
00:32:25.018 --> 00:32:27.893
- I'm offended you'd even ask me that.

418
00:32:27.976 --> 00:32:30.810
- Do something. It's slipping.
- Oh, relax, baldylocks.


419
00:32:35.935 --> 00:32:38.101
See? Teamwork.

420
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:43.268
Team. Team. Team.
It feels weird in my mouth.


421
00:32:43.351 --> 00:32:44.185
It does.

422
00:32:44.893 --> 00:32:49.143
Say what you will about Russian prisons,
the soap is incredible.


423
00:32:49.226 --> 00:32:51.935
- Are we doing this together or not?
- No added chemicals or perfumes.


424
00:32:52.018 --> 00:32:54.560
It's just pure
good ol' fashioned glycerin.


425
00:32:55.476 --> 00:32:58.143
- Ooh. Smell it.
- I'm not gonna smell it.


426
00:32:58.226 --> 00:33:00.851
Sotto Voce's masquerade ball
is tomorrow night,


427
00:33:00.935 --> 00:33:03.310
which means, if we're gonna beat
The Bishop to the second egg,


428
00:33:03.393 --> 00:33:06.351
we have to be on the other side
of these walls by tomorrow morning.


429
00:33:06.435 --> 00:33:07.935
I already know how I'm gonna steal it.

430
00:33:08.018 --> 00:33:10.851
It'll take adjustment now The Bishop'll
be there, but I'll beat her to the punch.


431
00:33:10.935 --> 00:33:13.143
"I"? What about "we"?

432
00:33:13.226 --> 00:33:16.101
Why are you wearing the hairnet?
You're bald.


433
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:22.685
Okay, fine. You can be my plus-one
to Sotto Voce's party.


434
00:33:23.393 --> 00:33:27.643
Thanks. Clock's tickin'.
We gotta get outta here. What's the plan?


435
00:33:28.185 --> 00:33:29.310
I'm working on it.

436
00:33:30.935 --> 00:33:33.226
You're working on it?
You sound like you're working on it.


437
00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:36.643
They say the most important part
of any plan is a good night's sleep.


438
00:33:37.393 --> 00:33:40.726
Isn't the actual plan part
the most important part of the plan?


439
00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:42.601
A lotta people make that mistake.

440
00:33:48.768 --> 00:33:50.643
Back in Bali, that thing you said,

441
00:33:52.101 --> 00:33:53.976
about me and my father, how'd you know?

442
00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:58.685
I hate to break it to you,
but you're not a complex case.


443
00:33:59.226 --> 00:34:01.268
The one thing
that doesn't quite line up for me is


444
00:34:01.351 --> 00:34:05.018
how the son of a Swiss police captain
turns to a life of high crime.


445
00:34:05.101 --> 00:34:06.143
Short version?

446
00:34:07.935 --> 00:34:11.893
My father was a prolific asshole.

447
00:34:12.851 --> 00:34:13.935
Long version?

448
00:34:15.393 --> 00:34:17.185
When I was eight years old,

449
00:34:18.976 --> 00:34:21.143
my dad thought I stole his watch.

450
00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:24.185
He loved that piece of metal
more than anything.


451
00:34:26.101 --> 00:34:29.060
He asked me if I stole it.
I told him I didn't.


452
00:34:29.851 --> 00:34:32.685
He said he knew that I had
and that I was lying.


453
00:34:33.351 --> 00:34:35.768
He didn't speak to me again after that.

454
00:34:35.851 --> 00:34:38.601
Not on Christmas. 
Not on my birthday.

455
00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:45.351
He went almost a full year,
just utter silence.


456
00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.976
Like I didn't even exist.

457
00:34:50.643 --> 00:34:52.060
Then one night, he…

458
00:34:53.518 --> 00:34:56.810
He comes home
and he sits down at the dinner table…


459
00:34:58.685 --> 00:35:00.018
And there it is.

460
00:35:00.101 --> 00:35:02.310
There's the watch, the missing watch,

461
00:35:03.018 --> 00:35:04.601
right there on his wrist.

462
00:35:04.685 --> 00:35:07.476
Found out later that he put it
in his desk at work


463
00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.268
and it got buried behind some papers
or something like that.


464
00:35:10.351 --> 00:35:12.560
But he never apologized. 
He just, uh…

465
00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.393
He just looked me in the eye
and said, "How was your day at school?"


466
00:35:19.018 --> 00:35:21.893
Then he kept askin',
"How was your day at school?"


467
00:35:21.976 --> 00:35:23.518
And I never answered him.

468
00:35:25.018 --> 00:35:27.518
I just stared at him.
I didn't eat. I didn't drink.


469
00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:31.143
Next week,
I found myself in boarding school.


470
00:35:35.976 --> 00:35:36.976
Really?

471
00:35:39.185 --> 00:35:41.143
I'm kidding.

472
00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:43.435
Hey.

473
00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:46.143
I'm sorry about all that.

474
00:35:47.435 --> 00:35:50.018
Oh, no, no, no, no,
it's all right.


475
00:35:50.101 --> 00:35:51.810
You learn a valuable lesson, you know?

476
00:35:52.685 --> 00:35:54.226
It doesn't matter what you do,

477
00:35:56.185 --> 00:35:58.185
only matters what they think you've done.

478
00:36:00.143 --> 00:36:01.101
How about your old man?

479
00:36:02.768 --> 00:36:03.935
I don't talk about him.

480
00:36:07.185 --> 00:36:08.185
That bad, huh?

481
00:36:22.393 --> 00:36:23.476
Good news.

482
00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.601
I slept like a baby after
our little therapy session last night.


483
00:36:27.101 --> 00:36:27.935
Better news,

484
00:36:28.435 --> 00:36:31.435
I've got our escape plan
down to a simple three-step process.


485
00:36:31.976 --> 00:36:33.810
All right, I'll bite.
What's the first step?


486
00:36:33.893 --> 00:36:36.268
- Create a distraction.
- With soap?


487
00:36:36.935 --> 00:36:39.476
You know what happens
when you mix soap, which is pure glycerin,


488
00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.351
with a cleaning solution
that's essentially nitric acid?


489
00:36:42.435 --> 00:36:44.476
- You get nitroglycerin.
- You get nitroglycerin.


490
00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.435
We should run.

491
00:36:45.518 --> 00:36:47.435
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.


492
00:37:30.601 --> 00:37:32.351
It's locked. We need a key card.

493
00:37:32.435 --> 00:37:33.601
Step two, plan ahead.

494
00:37:33.685 --> 00:37:35.851
- Where'd you get that?
<i>- Nyet politsiya.</i>


495
00:37:36.351 --> 00:37:37.268
He's not a cop!

496
00:37:53.518 --> 00:37:54.976
What's the plan-
- Son of a bitch!

497
00:37:56.476 --> 00:37:59.101
- What? Understood.

498
00:38:03.685 --> 00:38:05.643
What are you doing?
What's step three?


499
00:38:13.185 --> 00:38:14.226
Step three…

500
00:38:16.226 --> 00:38:17.268
Rock Jenga.

501
00:38:29.768 --> 00:38:30.893
You first.

502
00:38:31.476 --> 00:38:34.018
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.


503
00:38:34.101 --> 00:38:35.310
Get back!

504
00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.518
This way.

505
00:38:52.226 --> 00:38:55.685
They're outside the walls.
Secure the perimeter.


506
00:39:22.226 --> 00:39:24.435
Okay. Okay.

507
00:39:39.893 --> 00:39:41.685
Can you fly a helicopter?

508
00:39:41.768 --> 00:39:44.143
Does the back of your head
look like a huge penis?


509
00:39:46.268 --> 00:39:47.851
The answer is yes!

510
00:39:55.976 --> 00:39:58.226
Oh, that's fun. 
This is my best friend.

511
00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.143
- We're not friends.
- We're best friends.


512
00:40:03.893 --> 00:40:05.810
- They're over here!
- Go!


513
00:40:25.268 --> 00:40:26.935
I can't believe nobody saw that.

514
00:40:29.018 --> 00:40:30.393
Here they are! Fire!

515
00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:42.101
Okay.

516
00:40:42.185 --> 00:40:43.060
Oh.

517
00:40:43.143 --> 00:40:44.185
That's in Russian.

518
00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.685
Go, he just has a pistol!

519
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.435
The forklift!

520
00:41:35.768 --> 00:41:36.601
Huh.

521
00:42:10.185 --> 00:42:11.185
Uh-oh.

522
00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:32.143
Son of a bitch.

523
00:42:36.435 --> 00:42:37.310
Reload!

524
00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.768
Shit.

525
00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.310
Oh, you made it. Thank God!

526
00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:55.851
I was praying for you.

527
00:42:55.935 --> 00:42:58.018
Don't give me that shit.
You were gonna leave me?


528
00:42:59.185 --> 00:43:00.435
You said, "Save yourself."

529
00:43:00.518 --> 00:43:02.310
I said, "Go,"
but I didn't mean without me.


530
00:43:02.393 --> 00:43:04.476
You said, "Go save yourself."

531
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.560
And I was gonna carry you with me
in my heart like an eternal flame,


532
00:43:07.643 --> 00:43:08.851
you stupid complainer.

533
00:43:09.893 --> 00:43:11.351
Why is that blinking?

534
00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.851
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

535
00:43:21.018 --> 00:43:22.310
Ooh! Incoming!

536
00:43:43.726 --> 00:43:45.768
See? Easy-peasy.

537
00:43:53.018 --> 00:43:55.643
I know it sounds
like a tough childhood,


538
00:43:55.726 --> 00:43:57.976
but my father made
me who I am today.

539
00:43:59.976 --> 00:44:01.601
Maybe that's my problem.

540
00:44:02.726 --> 00:44:07.310
I'm so focused on winning all the time,
on being the best at what I do,


541
00:44:07.393 --> 00:44:11.518
that I can never
just fully relax and just be.


542
00:44:13.685 --> 00:44:14.851
Is that normal?

543
00:44:15.518 --> 00:44:17.018
How the fuck would I know?

544
00:44:22.976 --> 00:44:24.143
What?

545
00:44:24.226 --> 00:44:27.018
I'm not a therapist.
I'm an intelligence analyst.


546
00:44:27.101 --> 00:44:28.060
I'm sorry.

547
00:44:29.518 --> 00:44:31.726
I'm just dealing
with a lot right now


548
00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:33.893
and you seemed like
someone I could talk to.


549
00:44:34.393 --> 00:44:36.101
And it's so rare
in my line of work

550
00:44:36.185 --> 00:44:38.393
to find someone
who's just there to listen.


551
00:44:39.018 --> 00:44:39.851
Thank you.

552
00:44:40.726 --> 00:44:44.393
Anyway, I'm sorry
to rope you into all of this,


553
00:44:44.476 --> 00:44:46.226
but just using your terminal here

554
00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:49.685
to ensure that the origin point
of my message is untraceable.


555
00:44:49.768 --> 00:44:52.393
Best way to do it is
from within the system itself.


556
00:44:52.476 --> 00:44:55.851
They should really work on
patching the security vulnerability.


557
00:44:55.935 --> 00:44:56.976
It's embarrassing.

558
00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.935
Did you know that 99%
of all tracking protocols


559
00:45:00.018 --> 00:45:02.101
focus on third-party movements?

560
00:45:03.726 --> 00:45:07.351
No one ever expects the call
to come from inside the house, as it were.


561
00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:12.143
Hence, your computer, your office.

562
00:45:12.226 --> 00:45:13.976
Oh. Here we go.

563
00:45:14.685 --> 00:45:18.226
Just need to slow down my competition,
such as they are.


564
00:45:41.976 --> 00:45:44.435
I'm afraid that's
all the time we have for today.


565
00:45:44.935 --> 00:45:49.185
I'm gonna have to end our session here.
Have a lovely day.


566
00:45:49.268 --> 00:45:50.226
Freeze!

567
00:45:58.768 --> 00:45:59.893
See?

568
00:46:01.226 --> 00:46:03.351
This is why we can't have nice things.

569
00:46:03.435 --> 00:46:07.185
'Cause the moment I trust someone,
they tap the foot alarm beneath their desk


570
00:46:07.268 --> 00:46:09.310
and then I'm forced
to do things like this.


571
00:46:10.226 --> 00:46:13.101
I'm not angry. 
I'm just disappointed.

572
00:46:13.185 --> 00:46:15.560
I really thought you were different.

573
00:46:16.476 --> 00:46:18.726
Well, fool me once…

574
00:46:21.018 --> 00:46:22.685
I'm gonna leave now
and when he wakes up,

575
00:46:22.768 --> 00:46:25.393
you're going to tell him
that you triggered the alarm falsely


576
00:46:25.476 --> 00:46:28.101
and in his haste,
he tripped coming through the door.


577
00:46:28.935 --> 00:46:30.768
And if you decide not to do that,

578
00:46:31.393 --> 00:46:34.768
I want you to remember
one critically important thing.


579
00:46:35.476 --> 00:46:39.685
I know everyone you work with
and every member of your family.


580
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:43.268
And I also know your browser history.

581
00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.393
Nolan.

582
00:47:03.476 --> 00:47:05.726
Tambwe! Come on, bring it in.

583
00:47:06.518 --> 00:47:07.476
Oh.

584
00:47:08.726 --> 00:47:10.476
I can't thank you enough for this.

585
00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.685
I'm just glad
I could finally repay my debt to you.


586
00:47:12.768 --> 00:47:13.893
And now I'm in yours.

587
00:47:15.435 --> 00:47:16.726
- Come, everything is ready.
- Alright.


588
00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:18.310
- I have juice boxes.
- That's very good.


589
00:47:18.393 --> 00:47:21.768
Hey. Tambwe got us a costume change,
so we can get out of these filthy duds.


590
00:47:21.851 --> 00:47:22.935
Oh. I'm so sorry.

591
00:47:23.018 --> 00:47:26.060
Tambwe, this is Agent John Hartley

592
00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:29.351
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
It's a funny story.


593
00:47:29.435 --> 00:47:32.226
A lot of his colleagues have
put a lot of your colleagues in prison.


594
00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:33.310
It's exciting.

595
00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:36.185
No juice boxes for you.

596
00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:00.810
Oh, I see.

597
00:48:00.893 --> 00:48:03.518
Nice jacket, while I "Gotta dance."

598
00:48:03.601 --> 00:48:06.143
All right, man.
Don't even start with me, okay?


599
00:48:06.226 --> 00:48:07.935
At least you're comfortable.

600
00:48:10.685 --> 00:48:13.018
Well, clearly you have
this whole thing figured out.


601
00:48:13.101 --> 00:48:16.101
- You wanna walk me through it?
- I do. Here's the deal.


602
00:48:16.185 --> 00:48:17.268
<i>During the party,</i>

603
00:48:17.351 --> 00:48:20.268
<i>the guests and the staff</i>
<i>are required to stay on the main floor,</i>


604
00:48:20.351 --> 00:48:21.851
<i>and upstairs, the door to the egg room,</i>

605
00:48:21.935 --> 00:48:24.601
<i>well, that's locked and heavily guarded.</i>

606
00:48:24.685 --> 00:48:27.143
But there's another way in.
Hidden entrance.


607
00:48:27.226 --> 00:48:28.435
<i>Here's what I'm thinkin'.</i>

608
00:48:28.518 --> 00:48:31.060
<i>We dress up in matching black pajamas</i>

609
00:48:31.143 --> 00:48:34.060
<i>and sneak past the featured extras</i>
<i>and into the bedroom.</i>


610
00:48:35.518 --> 00:48:39.685
<i>Then, we slip through the study</i>
<i>and get our hands on his precious.</i>


611
00:48:39.768 --> 00:48:42.768
- Is that the egg?

612
00:48:42.851 --> 00:48:43.810
I'm sorry.

613
00:48:49.851 --> 00:48:51.393
- You are amazing.
- I know.


614
00:48:52.851 --> 00:48:53.685
Wow.

615
00:48:54.935 --> 00:48:56.351
- Hey, dickhead.
- Hmm?


616
00:48:56.435 --> 00:48:58.643
Your last brilliant plan
had some kinks in it.


617
00:48:58.726 --> 00:48:59.643
Mmm-hmm.

618
00:48:59.726 --> 00:49:01.976
So, what kinda security surveillance
are we looking at?


619
00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:03.351
Well, the guy's an arms dealer,

620
00:49:03.435 --> 00:49:06.476
so, you know, every square inch
of this place is gonna be on lock.


621
00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:10.476
<i>Two-man guard teams at every access point</i>
<i>are signal rotated to keep them frosty.</i>


622
00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.518
<i>Once they're on the move,</i>
<i>you only have 45 seconds until they land.</i>


623
00:49:14.601 --> 00:49:15.935
<i>It's a pretty tight window.</i>

624
00:49:16.976 --> 00:49:19.810
<i>The eyes and ears are</i>
<i>in a secure room in the west hall.</i>


625
00:49:19.893 --> 00:49:24.435
<i>Eighty-seven motion-sensitive 8K cameras</i>
<i>with an overlapping field of vision,</i>


626
00:49:24.518 --> 00:49:26.643
<i>so there are no natural blind spots.</i>

627
00:49:27.268 --> 00:49:29.018
<i>They're always watching, always listening.</i>

628
00:49:29.101 --> 00:49:30.768
<i>Kinda like Alexa but with guns.</i>

629
00:49:30.851 --> 00:49:32.851
<i>Now, here's where</i>
<i>things get a little tricky.</i>


630
00:49:32.935 --> 00:49:35.768
<i>The vault door to the egg room</i>
<i>is a military-grade,</i>


631
00:49:35.851 --> 00:49:39.518
<i>biometric portal made out of</i>
<i>a foot and a half of solid titanium.</i>


632
00:49:39.601 --> 00:49:42.726
<i>So you can't drill it</i>
<i>and you can't make it go boom.</i>


633
00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:45.643
<i>The only way through it</i>
<i>is with facial and voice recognition.</i>


634
00:49:45.726 --> 00:49:48.601
<i>And there's only one face</i>
<i>and one voice that opens it.</i>


635
00:49:49.101 --> 00:49:50.601
Sotto Voce.

636
00:49:50.685 --> 00:49:53.018
How are we gonna get
his voice and his facial?


637
00:49:53.101 --> 00:49:55.685
Well, first off,
a positive mental attitude helps.


638
00:49:56.185 --> 00:50:00.351
But so does some pretty kick-ass
deepfake technology.


639
00:50:02.226 --> 00:50:03.810
Spooky, right?

640
00:50:03.893 --> 00:50:06.018
If you have
more than 12 images on the Internet,


641
00:50:06.601 --> 00:50:10.018
I can send your mom
a video of you mouth-sexing a goat.


642
00:50:10.101 --> 00:50:13.476
I'm not saying I'm gonna do that,
I'm just saying I could if I wanted to.


643
00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.726
If I had enough time and enough pictures.

644
00:50:17.976 --> 00:50:20.060
But wait, there's more.

645
00:50:20.143 --> 00:50:24.393
<i>There's also a 12-digit randomly-generated</i>
<i>passcode that's changed every six minutes,</i>


646
00:50:24.476 --> 00:50:27.018
<i>and that code can only be found</i>
<i>in Sotto Voce's phone,</i>


647
00:50:27.101 --> 00:50:30.018
<i>and Sotto Voce's phone can only be found</i>
<i>in Sotto Voce's pants.</i>


648
00:50:30.643 --> 00:50:32.935
So, yeah, easy-peasy.

649
00:50:33.518 --> 00:50:35.685
Oh, no, no, no! There's one more thing.
Kinda important.


650
00:50:35.768 --> 00:50:40.935
We're gonna need his thumbprint 'cause
he never upgraded his iPhone -4, so…


651
00:50:41.018 --> 00:50:43.476
So if we don't get his thumbprint,
we can't get the egg.


652
00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.143
Oh, my God.

653
00:50:46.351 --> 00:50:48.935
You can learn. 
This is amazing.

654
00:50:49.018 --> 00:50:50.226
You are not sparkly enough.

655
00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:52.476
I'm gonna get you a matching vest
to go with those pants.


656
00:51:37.685 --> 00:51:40.560
Check, check. Roger Dodger.
What's your 20, free bird?


657
00:51:40.643 --> 00:51:43.226
You don't have to do that.
I'm standing right next to you.


658
00:51:43.310 --> 00:51:45.310
I'm not used to using these stupid things,

659
00:51:45.393 --> 00:51:47.351
and I'm not used
to working with a partner.


660
00:51:47.435 --> 00:51:49.976
We're not partners.
This is a marriage of convenience.


661
00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:52.226
I want a divorce
and I'm keeping the kids.


662
00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:53.643
Let's just do this.

663
00:51:53.726 --> 00:51:56.893
I'll get the thumbprint,
you get Sotto Voce's phone.


664
00:52:30.226 --> 00:52:31.768
We've got a party crasher.

665
00:52:32.351 --> 00:52:35.643
Yeah, it's no biggie. No biggie.
We knew she'd be here.


666
00:52:36.268 --> 00:52:37.810
We're here for the egg, not her.

667
00:52:37.893 --> 00:52:40.101
Speak for yourself. I'm going in.

668
00:52:40.851 --> 00:52:43.268
What are you doing?
That's not part of the plan.


669
00:52:43.351 --> 00:52:44.310
Plans change.

670
00:52:50.685 --> 00:52:51.893
Beautiful.

671
00:52:52.601 --> 00:52:53.976
The sculpture, I mean.

672
00:52:55.935 --> 00:52:58.685
I'm sorry, do we know each other?

673
00:52:58.768 --> 00:53:01.851
It's just impossible for me
to tell who you are with that mask on.


674
00:53:03.893 --> 00:53:05.435
- How about now?

675
00:53:05.518 --> 00:53:07.310
Agent Hartley!

676
00:53:09.435 --> 00:53:10.935
So it was you all along.

677
00:53:11.768 --> 00:53:13.768
Such a clever disguise.

678
00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:18.643
Well, I suppose you and Mr. Booth,
wherever he is,


679
00:53:18.726 --> 00:53:21.185
are here to try to beat me
to the second egg.


680
00:53:21.268 --> 00:53:23.851
<i>- Even the playing field.</i>
- Don't tell her anything.


681
00:53:23.935 --> 00:53:26.351
I'm not here for the egg.
I'm here to clear my name,


682
00:53:26.435 --> 00:53:27.601
<i>which means all I need is you.</i>

683
00:53:27.685 --> 00:53:29.310
You're literally telling her everything.

684
00:53:29.393 --> 00:53:34.518
We both know that this whole thing
is gonna end with you in handcuffs.


685
00:53:36.226 --> 00:53:39.185
Promises, promises.

686
00:53:55.101 --> 00:53:57.643
Careful now. We don't wanna cause a scene.

687
00:53:57.726 --> 00:53:59.560
Don't care.
I'm not letting you out of my sight.


688
00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:07.143
Oh, good, you're dancing with her.

689
00:54:08.685 --> 00:54:10.768
Not bad for a convict.

690
00:54:10.851 --> 00:54:15.643
Speaking of which,
how's it going with your partner in crime?


691
00:54:15.726 --> 00:54:18.143
Has he told you
where the third egg is yet?


692
00:54:18.226 --> 00:54:20.101
Well, if he did, 
I wouldn't tell you.

693
00:54:21.310 --> 00:54:23.643
That's a no. He must not trust you.

694
00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:27.476
You trust your partner?

695
00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.726
<i>What makes you think I have one?</i>

696
00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:32.893
Well, no one would be able to pull off
the scores you have alone.


697
00:54:32.976 --> 00:54:34.143
It's impossible.

698
00:54:40.851 --> 00:54:42.101
So what now?

699
00:54:42.185 --> 00:54:44.143
You're gonna arrest me right here,

700
00:54:44.685 --> 00:54:48.476
without a badge or a gun,
outside of your jurisdiction,


701
00:54:49.435 --> 00:54:52.310
and in front of
a room full of criminals?

702
00:54:54.685 --> 00:54:56.726
Is that your plan, 
Agent Hartley?

703
00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:06.643
Shit!

704
00:55:06.726 --> 00:55:09.351
<i>Incoming! Got the print.</i>
<i>Get the hell out of there.</i>


705
00:55:11.976 --> 00:55:15.393
Or perhaps you just
didn't think this all the way through.


706
00:55:18.893 --> 00:55:21.476
You're coming with me. Party's over.

707
00:55:28.268 --> 00:55:31.643
Watching you dance with this man
at my party has made me quite jealous.


708
00:55:31.726 --> 00:55:33.935
Well, I had to get your attention somehow.

709
00:55:35.726 --> 00:55:36.768
Didn't I?

710
00:55:38.435 --> 00:55:39.351
May I?

711
00:55:40.393 --> 00:55:41.976
Like you said, it's your party.

712
00:55:46.768 --> 00:55:47.643
Apologies.

713
00:55:51.435 --> 00:55:52.601
We needed to get his phone,

714
00:55:52.685 --> 00:55:54.893
not waste time
playing footsie with The Bishop.


715
00:55:54.976 --> 00:55:57.518
Don't worry. I got it.

716
00:55:58.518 --> 00:55:59.685
Excuse me.

717
00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:03.018
You're kidding. Nice pull!

718
00:56:03.101 --> 00:56:04.810
How'd you know Sotto Voce would cut in?

719
00:56:04.893 --> 00:56:09.518
Well, Sotto Voce is a 5'5" alpha male
with textbook Napoleon complex.


720
00:56:09.601 --> 00:56:13.726
So any time another male dances with
the most desirable woman at his party,


721
00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:17.726
well, he has no choice
but to step in and assert his dominance.


722
00:56:18.268 --> 00:56:19.768
You sneaky little minx.

723
00:56:19.851 --> 00:56:21.768
Where'd you learn that? 
Profiler school?

724
00:56:21.851 --> 00:56:22.851
High school.

725
00:56:42.976 --> 00:56:44.101
Ladies and gentlemen,

726
00:56:45.143 --> 00:56:50.018
it is my sincere pleasure
to welcome you all to my humble home.


727
00:56:50.101 --> 00:56:52.435
- Now's the time. 
He's speechifying.

728
00:56:52.518 --> 00:56:54.185
My father
was a man of conviction…


729
00:56:54.268 --> 00:56:55.268
Moving to two.

730
00:57:02.768 --> 00:57:04.851
Oh! Terribly, terribly sorry, sir.

731
00:57:05.435 --> 00:57:06.476
You imbecile!

732
00:57:07.018 --> 00:57:09.476
- Oh…
- Don't put your hands on me, peasant.


733
00:57:10.143 --> 00:57:13.060
I'm so sorry, sir.
A thousand apologies.


734
00:57:13.143 --> 00:57:15.518
I don't need your apologies,
I need a washroom.


735
00:57:15.601 --> 00:57:16.601
Take him.

736
00:57:17.185 --> 00:57:18.435
Right this way, sir.

737
00:57:18.518 --> 00:57:20.268
Let's get you hosed down.

738
00:57:20.351 --> 00:57:24.393
This pistol
was my father's prized possession.


739
00:57:24.476 --> 00:57:27.643
I've kept it close to my heart
since the day I killed him with it.


740
00:57:27.726 --> 00:57:30.601
I was never permitted
to touch this as a boy.


741
00:57:30.685 --> 00:57:31.685
Right this way.

742
00:57:33.643 --> 00:57:36.768
<i>It's just like the one</i>
<i>used by the Lone Ranger.</i>


743
00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:39.393
Hey.

744
00:57:39.893 --> 00:57:41.226
What's going on there?

745
00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:44.143
Someone spilled wine on a guest.
They're cleared.


746
00:58:01.518 --> 00:58:03.393
Something's off. 
I'm calling it in anyway.

747
00:58:03.476 --> 00:58:07.060
Don't be an idiot.
You read too many spy novels.


748
00:58:07.768 --> 00:58:10.185
<i>I miss you every day, Pop
-Pop.</i>

749
00:58:10.268 --> 00:58:13.226
<i>And in his immortal words,</i>

750
00:58:13.310 --> 00:58:18.560
"The skilled hunter needs but one bullet."

751
00:58:27.268 --> 00:58:29.518
- Bravo!
- Enjoy your evening.


752
00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:21.143
No, no, no, no, no.

753
00:59:24.893 --> 00:59:26.101
We gotta go.

754
00:59:48.101 --> 00:59:50.310
Here we go, nice and easy.

755
00:59:53.393 --> 00:59:55.560
Oh, my God!

756
00:59:55.643 --> 00:59:57.518
You're like a well-dressed wall.

757
00:59:57.601 --> 00:59:58.643
What are you doing?

758
00:59:58.726 --> 00:59:59.810
Trying to ruin the mission.

759
00:59:59.893 --> 01:00:02.226
Well, mission accomplished.
Find the print.


760
01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:03.143
God damn it!

761
01:00:03.935 --> 01:00:07.226
Come on, come on, come on,
you little bastard. Where are you?


762
01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:14.893
Shit!

763
01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.685
Gotcha.

764
01:00:27.851 --> 01:00:29.768
Phone, phone, phone, phone.

765
01:00:51.393 --> 01:00:53.476
Okay, it's deepfake time.

766
01:00:54.685 --> 01:00:56.393
Sotto Voce.

767
01:01:04.185 --> 01:01:05.143
Right.

768
01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:10.268
I thought
Mr. Voce was still at the party?


769
01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:13.810
Send a team.

770
01:01:14.476 --> 01:01:17.226
Security, we have a code red.

771
01:01:20.101 --> 01:01:21.185
Hey!

772
01:01:24.685 --> 01:01:26.518
You know,
for a guy who claims he's innocent,


773
01:01:26.601 --> 01:01:28.976
you sure do hang around
with a lot of criminals.


774
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.435
I am innocent.

775
01:01:30.518 --> 01:01:32.851
He's a pretty damn good thief
for his first time.


776
01:01:32.935 --> 01:01:34.393
- I'm not good at it.
- You are.


777
01:01:34.476 --> 01:01:36.101
- Don't say that.
- Don't sell yourself short.


778
01:01:36.185 --> 01:01:37.685
- Shut up.
- Hector Deflector over here.


779
01:01:37.768 --> 01:01:39.393
He's not good at taking a compliment.

780
01:01:39.476 --> 01:01:42.685
I need you to understand,
The Bishop is behind this entire thing.


781
01:01:42.768 --> 01:01:43.726
She set me up.

782
01:01:43.810 --> 01:01:47.726
Well, if this is all The Bishop's doing
and you really are innocent, prove it.


783
01:01:48.976 --> 01:01:52.268
Go on, detain your friend.

784
01:01:52.351 --> 01:01:53.393
We're not friends.

785
01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:55.351
- We're work wives.
- We're not work wives.


786
01:01:55.435 --> 01:01:57.268
- We're sister wives.
- We're not any kind of wives.


787
01:01:57.351 --> 01:01:58.476
Shut up! Both of you.

788
01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:02.185
You either arrest him
or I arrest you both.


789
01:02:03.893 --> 01:02:06.101
What's it gonna be, 
Agent Hartley?

790
01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:13.101
- I'm sorry, man.
- Oh…


791
01:02:13.726 --> 01:02:14.935
Oh, come on!

792
01:02:15.018 --> 01:02:16.601
- You're under arrest.
- You're gonna listen?


793
01:02:16.685 --> 01:02:18.560
After all we've been through together…

794
01:02:24.601 --> 01:02:25.601
You love me?

795
01:02:25.685 --> 01:02:26.851
I hate you.

796
01:02:28.518 --> 01:02:30.726
- Tight enough? Jesus!
- See?


797
01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:32.393
I'm a good guy.

798
01:02:33.643 --> 01:02:35.351
But sometimes I do bad things.

799
01:02:40.893 --> 01:02:43.226
- Hartley!
- Let's grab that egg and get out of here.


800
01:02:43.310 --> 01:02:45.060
You don't wanna talk
about what just happened?


801
01:02:45.143 --> 01:02:46.768
- What you talking about?
- We had a moment.


802
01:02:46.851 --> 01:02:49.393
- We didn't have a moment.
- No, we had a moment.


803
01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.643
Looking for something specific
or just browsing?


804
01:03:06.935 --> 01:03:08.976
You look awful.

805
01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:13.101
Hmm. You know, there
was an easier way in,

806
01:03:13.185 --> 01:03:16.268
but I doubt very much
that you could've managed it.


807
01:03:17.601 --> 01:03:20.851
Now that I have two
out of the three eggs,

808
01:03:22.726 --> 01:03:26.018
I'll give you one last chance
to take me up on my offer.


809
01:03:26.643 --> 01:03:28.685
- Well, here's my counteroffer.
- Mm-hmm.


810
01:03:28.768 --> 01:03:30.185
- You're under arrest.
- Oh, my God.


811
01:03:30.268 --> 01:03:31.435
Read the room.

812
01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:36.018
I told you, this would end
with you in handcuffs.


813
01:03:36.101 --> 01:03:38.601
You're so embarrassing.
He's so embarrassing.


814
01:03:39.518 --> 01:03:41.185
Tell you what, 
Agent Hartley.

815
01:03:43.143 --> 01:03:44.143
You wanna arrest me?

816
01:03:45.018 --> 01:03:46.060
Come…

817
01:03:48.851 --> 01:03:49.893
Arrest me.

818
01:03:50.643 --> 01:03:52.893
I just want the egg. So, uh--

819
01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:08.476
Take it easy.

820
01:04:10.393 --> 01:04:11.518
This is easy.

821
01:04:32.893 --> 01:04:34.185
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

822
01:05:11.101 --> 01:05:12.935
Sir, we have a
problem in the vault room.

823
01:05:15.518 --> 01:05:16.518
Excuse me.

824
01:06:01.393 --> 01:06:04.435
Bro, I didn't…
I didn't see the handcuffs coming.


825
01:06:05.351 --> 01:06:06.976
Mm, was a nice touch.

826
01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:09.226
God, this is such a confusing erection.

827
01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:10.810
You can't ever tell anybody about this.

828
01:06:10.893 --> 01:06:13.185
- I'll never tell anybody. Promise.
- Okay.


829
01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:18.893
Okay.

830
01:06:18.976 --> 01:06:21.810
Oh, whoa, hold on, hold on.
No, don't shoot.


831
01:06:22.810 --> 01:06:25.810
I'm not trying to be a tattletale.
We didn't steal your egg, okay?


832
01:06:25.893 --> 01:06:27.101
I mean, we tried.

833
01:06:28.018 --> 01:06:29.018
But she got it.

834
01:06:29.726 --> 01:06:31.268
He's telling you the truth.

835
01:06:31.768 --> 01:06:32.935
Is that so?

836
01:06:35.185 --> 01:06:37.768
Thank you. Oh. All right.

837
01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:47.018
Would you like to make
a confession, my lady?


838
01:06:49.185 --> 01:06:51.226
It's a pleasure doing business with you.

839
01:06:51.810 --> 01:06:53.310
I told you they'd come.

840
01:06:58.351 --> 01:06:59.685
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

841
01:06:59.768 --> 01:07:01.143
What the f--

842
01:07:25.143 --> 01:07:26.643
Good morning, gentlemen.

843
01:07:28.685 --> 01:07:32.351
Down here, beneath the bulls,
no one will hear your screams.


844
01:07:32.435 --> 01:07:34.351
That's called foreshadowing.

845
01:07:34.435 --> 01:07:35.976
- I know what it's called.
- Was making sure.


846
01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:38.060
You don't look like an English major.

847
01:07:38.143 --> 01:07:40.935
- Shut up.
<i>- Buongiorno,</i>everybody!


848
01:07:41.018 --> 01:07:43.268
- Perfect!
- I brought champagne.


849
01:07:43.351 --> 01:07:45.810
I would introduce you,
but I believe you've already met


850
01:07:45.893 --> 01:07:47.310
my lovely business associate.

851
01:07:47.393 --> 01:07:48.226
Yes.

852
01:07:48.310 --> 01:07:50.351
I told you The Bishop
was working with somebody.


853
01:07:50.435 --> 01:07:52.601
It's a marriage of convenience.

854
01:07:52.685 --> 01:07:55.476
You're familiar with that concept,
aren't you?


855
01:07:56.726 --> 01:07:59.768
You see, the dashing Mr. Voce here

856
01:07:59.851 --> 01:08:02.185
already held the second egg
in his possession.


857
01:08:02.268 --> 01:08:05.060
So, I approached him with my own offer,

858
01:08:05.143 --> 01:08:07.518
which brings us to the part

859
01:08:07.601 --> 01:08:12.226
where you tell us
where the third egg is.

860
01:08:20.143 --> 01:08:22.018
Piss off for a thousand years.

861
01:08:23.268 --> 01:08:25.976
Oh, bummer.
I really wanted to do it the easy way.


862
01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:31.685
That's okay. I'll get the information
from you by hurting him.


863
01:08:33.143 --> 01:08:34.268
I'm sorry, what?

864
01:08:34.351 --> 01:08:35.726
I love this plan.

865
01:08:39.101 --> 01:08:41.393
You two share a special bond.

866
01:08:41.476 --> 01:08:43.893
Otherwise, why would you
risk your lives together


867
01:08:43.976 --> 01:08:45.310
attempting to steal the egg?

868
01:08:45.393 --> 01:08:48.185
Isn't that right, 
Agent Hartley?

869
01:08:48.268 --> 01:08:50.935
There is no bond between us.
I barely know the guy.


870
01:08:51.018 --> 01:08:52.976
Booth, tell her we're not friends.

871
01:08:54.851 --> 01:08:56.851
- She knows about us, pal.
- That's bullshit.


872
01:08:56.935 --> 01:08:59.310
She knows about our special bond,
that you were my best man.


873
01:08:59.393 --> 01:09:00.435
Son of a bitch. He's lying.

874
01:09:01.018 --> 01:09:04.060
If she hurts you bad enough,
if she gets really creative with it,


875
01:09:04.143 --> 01:09:06.268
I'm gonna have no choice
but to tell her everything.


876
01:09:07.101 --> 01:09:11.393
Now, Mr. Booth, where is the third egg?

877
01:09:12.976 --> 01:09:15.643
Okay, here I go.

878
01:09:15.726 --> 01:09:17.310
No, don't. Wait.

879
01:09:25.185 --> 01:09:27.435
Oh, my God!

880
01:09:30.643 --> 01:09:31.976
Well…

881
01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:32.893
No.

882
01:09:32.976 --> 01:09:36.685
I guess now we find out what kind
of friend you really are, Mr. Booth,


883
01:09:36.768 --> 01:09:39.476
because we're gonna go
to my favorite place.


884
01:09:42.393 --> 01:09:43.226
No.

885
01:09:44.976 --> 01:09:46.518
No. Don't--

886
01:09:53.476 --> 01:09:54.810
Enough games, my love.

887
01:09:55.768 --> 01:10:00.643
If you want to make him talk,
this is how you get him to talk.


888
01:10:00.726 --> 01:10:01.810
Why is your shirt off?

889
01:10:01.893 --> 01:10:03.768
- Why is his shirt off?
- I don't know.


890
01:10:03.851 --> 01:10:07.393
Sometimes the old ways are the best.
Excuse me, darling.


891
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:17.601
There, there, Special Agent Hartley.

892
01:10:20.101 --> 01:10:23.351
Look! Look at your friend.

893
01:10:25.393 --> 01:10:28.810
- The egg. Now!

894
01:10:28.893 --> 01:10:30.768
Booth, please.

895
01:10:32.518 --> 01:10:34.435
Okay, stop, stop.
I'll tell you, all right?


896
01:10:35.893 --> 01:10:38.226
- It's in Egypt.
- Where in Egypt?


897
01:10:38.893 --> 01:10:40.935
There's a hidden chamber
in the Great Pyramid.


898
01:10:41.018 --> 01:10:43.476
Lidar discovered it a year ago.
They haven't opened it yet.


899
01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.893
- How do you know the egg is there?
- My mother was an Egyptologist.


900
01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:49.393
I could read hieroglyphics
before I could read English.


901
01:10:49.935 --> 01:10:52.060
That hidden chamber

902
01:10:53.226 --> 01:10:56.226
is the secret tomb of Cleopatra.

903
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:59.851
They buried the third egg there
when the other two went missing.


904
01:10:59.935 --> 01:11:02.476
The scans show it
sitting there plain as day.


905
01:11:04.726 --> 01:11:06.310
The third egg never left Egypt.

906
01:11:09.018 --> 01:11:11.851
He's not lying. 
I read about the chamber.

907
01:11:14.351 --> 01:11:15.726
Was that so hard?

908
01:11:18.976 --> 01:11:20.810
- Shall we celebrate?

909
01:11:28.810 --> 01:11:30.518
To the end of our business.

910
01:11:30.601 --> 01:11:32.726
And the beginning of our pleasure.

911
01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:46.851
- I mean…
- Oh, come on.


912
01:11:47.935 --> 01:11:50.226
You didn't see that coming, amateur hour?

913
01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:51.810
Guard!

914
01:11:51.893 --> 01:11:55.268
I don't know what happened.
We were just having a glass of champagne


915
01:11:55.351 --> 01:11:57.351
- when all of the sudden he fell.

916
01:11:59.226 --> 01:12:01.143
And scene.

917
01:12:01.643 --> 01:12:02.810
Long con?

918
01:12:03.393 --> 01:12:04.310
Long con.

919
01:12:04.393 --> 01:12:06.643
You know, lady,
I'm really starting to not like you.


920
01:12:07.476 --> 01:12:11.643
Now I'd really love to stay and see
how this whole thing turns out,


921
01:12:11.726 --> 01:12:17.101
but I'm late for a date
with a very large pyramid.


922
01:12:17.976 --> 01:12:19.893
Can't wait to see what happens next.

923
01:12:19.976 --> 01:12:21.310
So exciting!

924
01:12:30.393 --> 01:12:31.768
She's a good singer.

925
01:12:31.851 --> 01:12:34.726
You should have took that deal
when she offered it to you in prison.


926
01:12:34.810 --> 01:12:36.935
Well, you shouldn't have
got us caught by her boyfriend.


927
01:12:37.018 --> 01:12:38.601
Oh, how did I get us caught
by her boyfriend?


928
01:12:38.685 --> 01:12:41.143
Well, if you don't know that,
then you really are dumber than I look.


929
01:12:42.435 --> 01:12:45.476
Jesus! That's really scary.

930
01:12:49.226 --> 01:12:53.393
Oh, you look busted.
You look like a zombie.


931
01:12:55.435 --> 01:12:56.393
You did this.

932
01:12:56.476 --> 01:12:59.726
This is your fault. She was mine.

933
01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:03.351
Honey, honey, honey,
homegirl is a hard ten.


934
01:13:04.268 --> 01:13:05.726
And you look like…

935
01:13:06.518 --> 01:13:08.560
Like a muscular toddler.

936
01:13:09.143 --> 01:13:10.851
I don't think it was gonna work.

937
01:13:11.601 --> 01:13:13.726
- The height difference and…
- Oh, shit.


938
01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:19.060
- Whoa, whoa. Hold on.

939
01:13:19.143 --> 01:13:21.143
Let's talk about this.

940
01:13:23.268 --> 01:13:25.935
- John, you hit?
- No, surprisingly not.


941
01:13:26.018 --> 01:13:28.143
What? How is that possible?

942
01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:36.851
How did you get free?

943
01:13:36.935 --> 01:13:38.851
- He shot the cuff.
- He hit something?


944
01:13:40.643 --> 01:13:41.476
Lucky shot.

945
01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:42.851
We're gonna get out of here.

946
01:13:43.393 --> 01:13:44.726
We're really gonna do it.

947
01:13:45.351 --> 01:13:48.185
Oh, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, where are you goin'? We're partners.


948
01:13:48.268 --> 01:13:50.643
Oh, we're partners now?
No, our partnership ended


949
01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:53.268
when you let The Bishop
go all shock therapy on me.


950
01:13:53.351 --> 01:13:55.893
You're not gonna find The Bishop.
Not without me.


951
01:13:55.976 --> 01:13:58.393
I got a pretty good idea
where she's going because of you.


952
01:13:58.476 --> 01:14:00.601
- So, goodbye.
- I lied.


953
01:14:05.393 --> 01:14:07.060
- I lied.
- What do you mean, "you lied"?


954
01:14:07.143 --> 01:14:09.143
I lied about everything.
All of it. That whole thing.


955
01:14:09.226 --> 01:14:12.060
I lied to you, I lied to her,
I lied to Baby Jesus.


956
01:14:12.851 --> 01:14:13.685
All of 'em.

957
01:14:15.518 --> 01:14:20.810
Look, the point is,
is that the third egg isn't in Egypt.


958
01:14:20.893 --> 01:14:22.601
Right. I don't give
a shit about the egg.

959
01:14:22.685 --> 01:14:25.476
I care about arresting The Bishop
and clearing my name.


960
01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:28.643
Right. But you won't get to The Bishop
unless you get to the egg.


961
01:14:28.726 --> 01:14:30.310
And I know where the egg is.

962
01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:32.351
Just get me out of here.

963
01:14:32.435 --> 01:14:34.560
I'll get the egg
and you'll get The Bishop.


964
01:14:35.976 --> 01:14:36.976
Come on!

965
01:14:39.101 --> 01:14:40.476
Pretty please?

966
01:14:46.143 --> 01:14:47.060
Thoughts?

967
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:50.310
You hear that?

968
01:15:00.810 --> 01:15:01.810
Hey, hey, hey.

969
01:15:02.726 --> 01:15:03.560
Up here.

970
01:15:04.185 --> 01:15:07.060
We'll disappear into the crowd.
We'll be home free.


971
01:15:23.601 --> 01:15:24.976
Oh, shit!

972
01:15:25.851 --> 01:15:28.351
I think we're gonna get out of here.

973
01:15:28.893 --> 01:15:30.185
Shit!

974
01:15:35.518 --> 01:15:37.726
- No, no. Don't move. Don't move.
- Why?


975
01:15:37.810 --> 01:15:40.768
Bulls have terrible eyesight.
But they can sense motion.


976
01:15:40.851 --> 01:15:42.268
You're thinking of <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

977
01:15:42.351 --> 01:15:45.768
No! I saw a nature documentary
starring David Attenborough.


978
01:15:45.851 --> 01:15:49.018
You're thinking of Richard Attenborough
from <i>Jurassic Park.</i>


979
01:15:53.143 --> 01:15:56.143
<i>Vámonos. Vámonos.</i>
They're telling me to run.


980
01:15:56.226 --> 01:15:58.185
If you run, you die.

981
01:16:00.851 --> 01:16:02.726
All right, yes or no,
was Jeff Goldblum in it?


982
01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:05.810
Oh, my God! It was <i>Jurassic Park.</i>
That's Jeff Goldblum.


983
01:16:05.893 --> 01:16:06.810
Asshole!

984
01:16:13.143 --> 01:16:15.393
Run, run, run, run, run
or you will die!


985
01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:20.101
A-ha--

986
01:16:29.685 --> 01:16:30.851
Ah.

987
01:16:32.226 --> 01:16:33.351
Thank you!

988
01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:38.393
What's your problem?

989
01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:40.060
Don't run?

990
01:16:40.768 --> 01:16:42.018
Don't run?

991
01:16:43.226 --> 01:16:45.060
You gonna be
this grumpy the whole trip?


992
01:16:45.143 --> 01:16:47.226
Wait till you see our ride.
You're gonna love it.


993
01:16:56.268 --> 01:16:58.810
This is fun, isn't it?

994
01:16:58.893 --> 01:17:01.060
Riding the rails hobo-style.

995
01:17:01.143 --> 01:17:04.226
You ever see, um, uh, <i>Sullivan's Travels?</i>

996
01:17:04.726 --> 01:17:05.768
No, I haven't.

997
01:17:05.851 --> 01:17:07.893
And no, it's not,
all right? Cough it up.

998
01:17:07.976 --> 01:17:09.768
Where are we headed?
Where's the third egg?


999
01:17:09.851 --> 01:17:11.476
All right, fine.

1000
01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:15.101
I've been thinking about this a lot,
and I can't tell you.


1001
01:17:15.810 --> 01:17:17.268
What do you mean, you can't tell me?

1002
01:17:17.351 --> 01:17:20.143
It's not so much of a "can't,"
it's more of a "won't."


1003
01:17:23.976 --> 01:17:25.435
Take me to the third egg, Booth.

1004
01:17:31.185 --> 01:17:32.143
You wanna do it?

1005
01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.601
Do it.

1006
01:17:35.476 --> 01:17:36.643
You can't, can you?

1007
01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:40.060
'Cause even though you're
running around with me, playing the thief,


1008
01:17:41.018 --> 01:17:42.976
you're not a real bad guy, Bubba.

1009
01:17:54.226 --> 01:17:56.893
Let's get something straight right now.

1010
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:59.476
That was terrifying.

1011
01:18:00.768 --> 01:18:03.851
Look, it's not that
I don't care about you.


1012
01:18:03.935 --> 01:18:06.101
It's that I don't care about anyone.

1013
01:18:08.518 --> 01:18:09.476
My dad was a crook.

1014
01:18:11.935 --> 01:18:13.143
A con man, actually.

1015
01:18:15.435 --> 01:18:16.435
He was the best.

1016
01:18:17.768 --> 01:18:20.893
Then on my 13th birthday,
he didn't show up.


1017
01:18:21.393 --> 01:18:23.351
My mom and I never saw him again.

1018
01:18:27.976 --> 01:18:28.810
Wow.

1019
01:18:30.976 --> 01:18:32.976
We really got some dads, huh?

1020
01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:35.101
It's a miracle we're not both strippers.

1021
01:18:35.185 --> 01:18:36.893
Yeah.

1022
01:18:40.601 --> 01:18:43.726
Look, your dad was a cop,
so you became a crook.


1023
01:18:44.351 --> 01:18:46.643
My dad was a crook,
so I became a cop.

1024
01:18:47.310 --> 01:18:48.560
We're not that different.

1025
01:18:49.226 --> 01:18:51.351
I'm not asking you
to care about me, Booth.


1026
01:18:52.476 --> 01:18:53.851
I'm asking you to help me.

1027
01:18:54.726 --> 01:18:58.685
Help me catch The Bishop
and clear my name,


1028
01:18:58.768 --> 01:19:02.976
and I will help you become the number one
art thief in the world again.


1029
01:19:04.935 --> 01:19:07.310
It's the only chance I have
to get my life back.


1030
01:19:08.518 --> 01:19:09.351
Please.

1031
01:19:18.893 --> 01:19:21.851
April, 1945.

1032
01:19:25.185 --> 01:19:27.685
<i>The Red Army's at the gate,</i>
<i>days from taking Berlin.</i>


1033
01:19:28.268 --> 01:19:30.101
<i>It's game over for the Nazis,</i>

1034
01:19:30.185 --> 01:19:33.476
<i>and that's when a forgotten Mr. Nobody</i>
<i>named Rudolph Zeich,</i>


1035
01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:36.226
<i>Hitler's personal</i>
<i>art and antiquities dealer,</i>


1036
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:39.976
<i>and the only man ever rumored</i>
<i>to have held Cleopatra's third egg</i>


1037
01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:41.643
<i>in his hands,</i>

1038
01:19:41.726 --> 01:19:45.643
<i>hopped a steamer ship</i>
<i>and fled Germany for Argentina.</i>


1039
01:19:45.726 --> 01:19:48.393
<i>The manifest shows</i>
<i>he traveled with just a single suitcase.</i>


1040
01:19:48.476 --> 01:19:55.393
<i>Oh, and sixteen five-ton cargo containers</i>
<i>logged only as holding machine parts.</i>


1041
01:19:57.435 --> 01:20:00.351
<i>Now, why would an art dealer</i>
<i>leave his patron's side</i>


1042
01:20:00.435 --> 01:20:01.851
<i>and travel halfway around the globe,</i>

1043
01:20:01.935 --> 01:20:06.101
<i>with nearly 100 tons</i>
<i>of so-called machine parts?</i>


1044
01:20:07.268 --> 01:20:10.268
<i>For 70 years,</i>
<i>amateur sleuths, treasure hunters,</i>


1045
01:20:10.351 --> 01:20:14.143
<i>and adult virgins everywhere</i>
<i>became obsessed with this question,</i>


1046
01:20:15.101 --> 01:20:20.268
<i>obsessed with finding what they believed</i>
<i>had to be Hitler's lost bunker,</i>


1047
01:20:20.351 --> 01:20:23.143
<i>hidden somewhere in South America.</i>

1048
01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:27.643
<i>And my dad was one of them.</i>

1049
01:20:28.226 --> 01:20:30.643
<i>He'd spend weekends</i>
<i>holed up in his office,</i>


1050
01:20:30.726 --> 01:20:33.435
<i>poring over old maps</i>
<i>and declassified files.</i>


1051
01:20:34.643 --> 01:20:37.768
<i>Holidays, he'd drive hours away</i>
<i>to obscure auctions,</i>


1052
01:20:37.851 --> 01:20:40.018
<i>where he'd bid on the strangest things.</i>

1053
01:20:42.726 --> 01:20:45.726
<i>Including a watch.</i>

1054
01:20:48.351 --> 01:20:54.643
<i>And not just any watch.</i>
<i>Creepy Nazi art guy Rudolph Zeich's watch.</i>


1055
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:58.851
<i>That same watch</i>
<i>my father chose to love more than me.</i>


1056
01:20:58.935 --> 01:21:01.018
<i>What a dick.</i>

1057
01:21:04.810 --> 01:21:07.060
<i>Never wanted anything to do</i>
<i>with his treasure hunt,</i>


1058
01:21:07.143 --> 01:21:08.518
<i>even after he passed.</i>

1059
01:21:09.643 --> 01:21:12.018
<i>That was my father's thing,</i>
<i>and he could have it.</i>


1060
01:21:20.726 --> 01:21:23.976
<i>But when I discovered what was inside it,</i>

1061
01:21:24.810 --> 01:21:28.976
<i>I knew right then that
I held in my hand</i>

1062
01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:31.810
<i>the secret to the third egg's location.</i>

1063
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:04.685
Booth,
you've had me traveling for three days


1064
01:22:04.768 --> 01:22:07.185
and hiking in circles for eight hours.

1065
01:22:07.268 --> 01:22:08.810
That map better be right.

1066
01:22:09.393 --> 01:22:11.060
Relax, we'll find it.

1067
01:22:11.143 --> 01:22:12.810
Say we find it.

1068
01:22:12.893 --> 01:22:14.976
How can you be sure
the egg is actually there?


1069
01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:18.226
- What do you mean?
- I get that Rudolph the red-nosed Nazi guy


1070
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:21.226
is rumored to be the last person
to ever hold the egg in his hands,


1071
01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:25.726
and that this mystery bunker is rumored
to have all this stolen treasure.


1072
01:22:25.810 --> 01:22:28.768
How can you be sure
the third egg itself is actually there?


1073
01:22:28.851 --> 01:22:29.685
Faith.

1074
01:22:31.976 --> 01:22:32.810
Faith?

1075
01:22:32.893 --> 01:22:34.351
I'm sorry, I just wanna be clear.

1076
01:22:34.435 --> 01:22:37.601
So we're out in the middle of nowhere
based on faith?


1077
01:22:38.143 --> 01:22:40.518
Or "gut vibe" if you're
not into the whole religious thing.


1078
01:22:40.601 --> 01:22:41.435
No.

1079
01:22:41.935 --> 01:22:44.768
You know, the kinda thing I'm into
is a good plan.


1080
01:22:44.851 --> 01:22:47.143
A smart plan, the opposite of this.

1081
01:22:47.226 --> 01:22:50.310
Relax. I have good news.
If I'm reading this map right…


1082
01:22:51.893 --> 01:22:52.726
We're here.

1083
01:22:52.810 --> 01:22:54.143
- We're where?
- We've arrived.


1084
01:22:54.226 --> 01:22:55.268
X marks the spot.

1085
01:22:55.351 --> 01:22:58.101
X… What spot? 
X marks the spot.

1086
01:22:58.185 --> 01:23:00.476
We're here. Here it is. Great job!

1087
01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.935
- Please don't yell at me.
- You found it! Booth found it.


1088
01:23:03.018 --> 01:23:04.810
There's no bunker. 
There's shit here.

1089
01:23:04.893 --> 01:23:07.018
- I'm just telling you what the map says.
- There's no bunker.


1090
01:23:07.101 --> 01:23:08.476
Tell me, what does the map say?

1091
01:23:09.268 --> 01:23:11.185
Oh, shit!

1092
01:23:13.226 --> 01:23:14.976
Yeah, it's gonna be a long walk back.

1093
01:23:16.018 --> 01:23:17.935
You know what I blame?
I blame the compass.


1094
01:23:18.018 --> 01:23:20.601
I got this thing back in Scouts.
It's been a little wonky.


1095
01:23:20.685 --> 01:23:22.268
It was never my strong suit.

1096
01:23:22.351 --> 01:23:23.476
- Can I see this?
- Absolutely.


1097
01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:24.768
- Can I see this?
- Of course.


1098
01:23:26.435 --> 01:23:27.435
I see what the problem is.

1099
01:23:28.185 --> 01:23:29.976
- That's the problem.
- Oh. That is not kind.


1100
01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:32.643
You know what's not kind?
Dragging me out in the middle of nowhere,


1101
01:23:32.726 --> 01:23:35.226
halfway around the world,
based on a goddamn hunch!


1102
01:24:29.976 --> 01:24:31.060
Holy shit!

1103
01:25:00.643 --> 01:25:02.643
Guess they're paying the utilities.

1104
01:25:04.351 --> 01:25:06.101
It's gotta be hydroelectric power,

1105
01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:09.143
which means there's
running water somewhere down here.


1106
01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:14.810
Look at that door.
Nothing hiding behind there.


1107
01:25:19.768 --> 01:25:21.351
How are we gonna get through this?

1108
01:25:24.851 --> 01:25:28.101
Oh, shit!

1109
01:25:29.726 --> 01:25:32.435
You have got to be kidding.

1110
01:25:38.518 --> 01:25:39.893
Is that your father's watch?

1111
01:25:39.976 --> 01:25:43.143
No. It's the watch from <i>Pulp Fiction.</i>

1112
01:25:43.726 --> 01:25:45.435
Yes, it's my father's watch.

1113
01:25:46.143 --> 01:25:49.518
- I thought you said you smashed it.
- I had it repaired. Is that a problem?


1114
01:25:49.601 --> 01:25:52.185
No, it's not a problem.
Glad you're not touchy about it.


1115
01:25:52.268 --> 01:25:53.268
Please shut up.

1116
01:25:57.393 --> 01:25:59.310
Uh, fun with magnets. All right.

1117
01:26:11.768 --> 01:26:12.893
Dad…

1118
01:26:15.393 --> 01:26:16.935
Please be good crazy.

1119
01:27:19.893 --> 01:27:22.268
Forget the egg,
let's just steal this stuff.


1120
01:27:22.351 --> 01:27:24.226
We're not here to steal anything.

1121
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:27.435
Uh, actually we are.
We're here to steal the egg.


1122
01:27:27.518 --> 01:27:28.726
You know what I mean.

1123
01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:32.143
Oh, I steal it, it's stealing,
and you steal it, it's what?


1124
01:27:32.226 --> 01:27:34.310
How about we just shut up?
And by we, I mean you.


1125
01:27:34.393 --> 01:27:35.851
You're also rude too.

1126
01:27:36.893 --> 01:27:38.726
Rude to boot.

1127
01:27:39.768 --> 01:27:41.601
How are we gonna find this egg?

1128
01:27:41.685 --> 01:27:42.893
I don't know.

1129
01:27:43.435 --> 01:27:45.810
Look for a box that says "MacGuffin."

1130
01:28:02.685 --> 01:28:03.851
Oh!

1131
01:28:03.935 --> 01:28:05.393
Do you know what this is?

1132
01:28:05.893 --> 01:28:07.768
This is…

1133
01:28:07.851 --> 01:28:12.935
Yes, this is
a 1931 Mercedes-Benz Grosser 770.


1134
01:28:13.601 --> 01:28:16.101
I could flip this for $25 million, easy.

1135
01:28:16.185 --> 01:28:18.685
There's, like, three of these left
on the planet. Four!


1136
01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.060
There's four now.

1137
01:28:21.143 --> 01:28:22.518
Three quarter-inch steel,

1138
01:28:22.601 --> 01:28:25.185
reinforced armor-plating,
bullet-resistant glass,


1139
01:28:25.268 --> 01:28:27.685
and a 24-karat gold inlay.

1140
01:28:28.268 --> 01:28:29.893
This is a convertible tank.

1141
01:28:29.976 --> 01:28:32.893
And it's in mint condition.
I bet you this thing still runs.


1142
01:28:32.976 --> 01:28:34.810
Too bad it was driven by Nazi scum.

1143
01:28:34.893 --> 01:28:36.393
It's a shame we're
gonna have to burn it.

1144
01:28:36.476 --> 01:28:38.310
How did they get it down here anyway?

1145
01:28:38.393 --> 01:28:41.476
They carry it down the stairs
in tiny pieces and reassemble?


1146
01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:42.476
Through there.

1147
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:47.476
Place must have been built off
one of those old copper mines.


1148
01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:50.268
The shafts down here are massive
and go on for miles.


1149
01:28:50.851 --> 01:28:54.018
Build the bunker, bring in the loot,
seal the shaft…


1150
01:28:54.101 --> 01:28:55.143
Bob's your uncle.

1151
01:28:55.685 --> 01:28:57.060
Who's your daddy?

1152
01:28:57.143 --> 01:28:58.768
That's not how it goes.

1153
01:28:58.851 --> 01:28:59.935
I know.

1154
01:29:04.185 --> 01:29:08.518
Well, labels, Nazis, dum-dums.

1155
01:29:28.935 --> 01:29:29.893
Five-second rule.

1156
01:29:29.976 --> 01:29:33.851
It's fine. Totally fine.
Not a scratch on it.


1157
01:29:33.935 --> 01:29:36.685
Are you sure you don't wanna
flip this one? I got a guy.


1158
01:29:36.768 --> 01:29:38.476
Let me save you the trouble.

1159
01:29:40.810 --> 01:29:42.976
Your entrances are bullshit.

1160
01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:44.435
Egypt?

1161
01:29:45.101 --> 01:29:48.518
Did you really think I ran right off
to the pyramids on your good word?


1162
01:29:48.601 --> 01:29:51.560
All I had to do was wait for you two
to escape from Sotto Voce,


1163
01:29:51.643 --> 01:29:53.810
and you led me
right to the third egg,

1164
01:29:53.893 --> 01:29:55.935
which I'm going to take from you now.

1165
01:29:56.726 --> 01:29:59.393
So, uh, hand it over.

1166
01:30:00.435 --> 01:30:01.976
Come on, don't be shy.

1167
01:30:05.143 --> 01:30:07.643
Good job. Attaboy.

1168
01:30:09.768 --> 01:30:10.893
Drop your weapon!

1169
01:30:15.018 --> 01:30:16.851
This way! On that side.

1170
01:30:20.685 --> 01:30:22.351
How did she find us?

1171
01:30:22.435 --> 01:30:24.851
I followed you. 
She must have followed me.

1172
01:30:26.893 --> 01:30:27.851
No shit!

1173
01:30:31.101 --> 01:30:33.518
Why are you shooting at them?
I thought you were on their side.


1174
01:30:33.601 --> 01:30:35.726
I am on their side. 
They shot at me first.

1175
01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:39.226
How are we gonna get out of here?

1176
01:30:41.976 --> 01:30:42.893
We take that.

1177
01:30:43.476 --> 01:30:45.643
I don't think that's
gonna make it up the stairs.


1178
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:48.560
- It ain't going up the stairs.

1179
01:30:50.351 --> 01:30:51.226
Cover us.

1180
01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:09.476
- Go, go, go!
- I'm trying!


1181
01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:10.560
Let's go.

1182
01:31:11.893 --> 01:31:13.976
- Huh? Ha-ha!

1183
01:31:29.893 --> 01:31:30.851
Let's go!

1184
01:31:33.268 --> 01:31:34.435
- Throw it.
- What?


1185
01:31:34.518 --> 01:31:35.351
Now!

1186
01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:49.226
You two with me,
the rest of you follow.

1187
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:50.143
Go!

1188
01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:14.310
I'm all out.

1189
01:32:33.976 --> 01:32:35.476
Pull over!

1190
01:32:55.893 --> 01:32:57.560
- Shit!

1191
01:33:03.018 --> 01:33:03.976
Whoa!

1192
01:33:33.476 --> 01:33:34.976
Bishop, the egg!

1193
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:40.518
You saved me.

1194
01:34:40.601 --> 01:34:43.560
You love me. You love me like crazy.

1195
01:34:51.393 --> 01:34:53.018
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Shit!


1196
01:34:58.268 --> 01:34:59.518
We're running out of road.

1197
01:35:00.101 --> 01:35:02.976
Hold on to something!
If we stop, they'll catch us.


1198
01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:04.643
Then let's get caught.

1199
01:35:04.726 --> 01:35:07.476
We can escape later.
It works for me all the time.


1200
01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.726
Make sure to kick clear of the car.

1201
01:35:09.810 --> 01:35:12.393
- I would like to workshop this idea.
- Oh, shit!


1202
01:36:12.643 --> 01:36:14.351
It's just like we drew it up, right?

1203
01:36:16.435 --> 01:36:17.435
Hartley?

1204
01:36:20.101 --> 01:36:21.143
Hartley?

1205
01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:30.518
Hartley?

1206
01:36:36.893 --> 01:36:38.226
You will be missed.

1207
01:36:47.851 --> 01:36:51.185
Oh, shit! God damn it.

1208
01:36:51.268 --> 01:36:52.185
Hartley?

1209
01:36:53.351 --> 01:36:56.060
Hartley? Hartley?

1210
01:36:56.601 --> 01:36:58.768
Hey, where are you, you big idiot?

1211
01:36:58.851 --> 01:37:00.435
Who are you calling an idiot?

1212
01:37:01.601 --> 01:37:02.518
I'm right here.

1213
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:12.351
- Did you just choose me over the egg?
- No.


1214
01:37:12.435 --> 01:37:14.851
- Well, it kinda looks like you did.
- I didn't.


1215
01:37:14.935 --> 01:37:16.601
You went running in there to rescue me.

1216
01:37:16.685 --> 01:37:18.101
I left my phone in there.

1217
01:37:18.726 --> 01:37:21.060
You only have
a finite amount of time to save it.


1218
01:37:21.143 --> 01:37:23.060
Stick it in a bag of rice,
it's a whole thing.


1219
01:37:23.143 --> 01:37:24.351
You thought I was dead.

1220
01:37:24.435 --> 01:37:26.351
I didn't think you were dead.
I wished you were dead.


1221
01:37:26.435 --> 01:37:29.018
I saw you splashing around.
"Hartley! Hartley!"


1222
01:37:29.101 --> 01:37:31.851
Yes, okay, I wanted to pull you out,

1223
01:37:31.935 --> 01:37:35.310
save you, get your hopes up,
and then pull you, shove you under.


1224
01:37:49.393 --> 01:37:52.351
Look, I'm not gonna
make a big deal out of this.


1225
01:37:53.226 --> 01:37:55.310
I'm not gonna gloat. 
It's not who I am.

1226
01:37:55.393 --> 01:37:57.851
Would some people say
that this is very embarrassing for you?


1227
01:37:57.935 --> 01:38:00.018
Yes, of course. 
Of course they would.

1228
01:38:00.101 --> 01:38:02.185
Probably everybody.

1229
01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:04.601
But that's not important right now.

1230
01:38:04.685 --> 01:38:08.060
What's important is that
you realize you lost and I won.


1231
01:38:08.143 --> 01:38:08.976
We.

1232
01:38:09.851 --> 01:38:13.185
We won. Together. Friendship. Teamwork.

1233
01:38:13.268 --> 01:38:14.935
It's called the moral of the story.

1234
01:38:15.018 --> 01:38:18.101
And something that I've been
wanting to say for years


1235
01:38:18.185 --> 01:38:19.601
to your face is…

1236
01:38:20.393 --> 01:38:21.560
Checkmate.

1237
01:38:22.435 --> 01:38:23.685
Oh, that feels good.

1238
01:38:23.768 --> 01:38:26.351
I've got two eggs, you've got one,
and you think you won?


1239
01:38:27.393 --> 01:38:28.768
How's that work exactly?

1240
01:38:28.851 --> 01:38:31.393
I don't have to win
in order for you to lose.


1241
01:38:31.476 --> 01:38:33.560
That's the best part of this whole thing.

1242
01:38:33.643 --> 01:38:36.476
As long as I have the third egg,
you can't win.


1243
01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:38.768
I don't care about the money anymore.

1244
01:38:38.851 --> 01:38:40.476
Honestly, look at your face right now.

1245
01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:42.643
That face right there.
Just… Yeah. Perfect.


1246
01:38:42.726 --> 01:38:46.726
Resting failure face.
I mean, in a word, priceless.


1247
01:38:46.810 --> 01:38:48.685
Also, it just gets better.

1248
01:38:48.768 --> 01:38:51.601
As an added bonus,
my friend here, at no extra charge,


1249
01:38:51.685 --> 01:38:55.560
is gonna give you
a lifetime supply of prison.


1250
01:38:55.643 --> 01:38:58.560
So… That's-a nice.

1251
01:38:59.351 --> 01:39:00.768
- Stand up.
- Stand up.


1252
01:39:06.643 --> 01:39:07.893
Told you how this was gonna end.

1253
01:39:23.810 --> 01:39:25.810
You're right. I am the bad guy.

1254
01:39:25.893 --> 01:39:28.685
I know how a confidence scheme works,
trust me.


1255
01:39:28.768 --> 01:39:30.143
You don't know me, Booth.

1256
01:39:30.768 --> 01:39:33.268
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

1257
01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:40.143
What the fuck?

1258
01:39:41.143 --> 01:39:41.976
Look at him.

1259
01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:44.768
Resting failure face. Priceless.

1260
01:39:45.351 --> 01:39:47.268
This whole time you were working for her?

1261
01:39:47.351 --> 01:39:48.726
Not for, with.

1262
01:39:48.810 --> 01:39:51.893
- Like partners.
- Yeah, we're both The Bishop.


1263
01:39:51.976 --> 01:39:53.935
Has he told you
where the third egg is yet?


1264
01:39:56.935 --> 01:39:58.851
- I love you.
- I love you too.


1265
01:39:58.935 --> 01:40:00.101
- Ready?
- Yep.


1266
01:40:01.768 --> 01:40:02.601
Surprise!

1267
01:40:04.726 --> 01:40:06.143
There are two bishops in chess.

1268
01:40:06.226 --> 01:40:08.476
- And a whole lotta pawns.
- Hmm.


1269
01:40:09.726 --> 01:40:12.435
<i>I passed the first egg</i>
<i>on to her in Bali.</i>


1270
01:40:12.518 --> 01:40:14.268
She took the second egg from Sotto Voce.

1271
01:40:14.351 --> 01:40:17.351
And the third egg, well,
the only way for us to get our hands on it


1272
01:40:17.435 --> 01:40:20.143
was if you led us right to it,
which you did.


1273
01:40:20.226 --> 01:40:22.226
I thought for sure
you were gonna see through my


1274
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:24.185
"We're not partners,
I gotta clear my name,


1275
01:40:24.268 --> 01:40:26.185
I'm Johnny Law, blah, blah, blah."

1276
01:40:26.726 --> 01:40:29.268
To be honest, I thought
I laid it on too thick in the prison.


1277
01:40:29.351 --> 01:40:31.893
- No, honey, you were so good.
- No? Really?


1278
01:40:31.976 --> 01:40:34.726
Appreciate that. What'd you think?
You think it was too much?


1279
01:40:34.810 --> 01:40:37.310
I have notes. Otherwise, pretty good.

1280
01:40:37.393 --> 01:40:38.560
"Pretty good"? All right.

1281
01:40:38.643 --> 01:40:41.351
Let's just rewind for one second here.

1282
01:40:41.976 --> 01:40:45.101
You electrocuted him. 
You went "Downtown."

1283
01:40:45.185 --> 01:40:46.726
Yes. By the way, that hurt like hell.

1284
01:40:46.810 --> 01:40:50.560
I know. I'm so sorry. I had to.

1285
01:40:53.226 --> 01:40:54.310
No.

1286
01:40:54.393 --> 01:40:57.393
<i>It was the only way I could</i>
<i>pass you a key to slip the cuffs.</i>


1287
01:40:58.935 --> 01:41:00.768
How did you get free?

1288
01:41:01.643 --> 01:41:04.810
Well, anyhoo, the egg.

1289
01:41:04.893 --> 01:41:05.851
The egg.

1290
01:41:05.935 --> 01:41:07.810
That gun is soaking wet. 
There's no way--

1291
01:41:07.893 --> 01:41:09.101
I'm not a Navy SEAL.

1292
01:41:12.185 --> 01:41:13.143
Third egg.

1293
01:41:13.976 --> 01:41:15.976
- Thank you.
- Let's take a walk.


1294
01:41:21.518 --> 01:41:25.143
So it was all a lie?
Even the sob story about your dad?


1295
01:41:25.226 --> 01:41:28.601
No. My dad was a
con man, and I hated him.

1296
01:41:29.685 --> 01:41:32.018
So I decided to become better
than he ever was.


1297
01:41:32.101 --> 01:41:33.393
Beat him at his own game.

1298
01:41:35.393 --> 01:41:37.476
Booth, don't be too hard on yourself.

1299
01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:40.185
You're good,
really good, better than most.


1300
01:41:40.768 --> 01:41:42.518
We got nothing but respect for you.

1301
01:41:43.685 --> 01:41:44.810
Better luck next time.

1302
01:41:44.893 --> 01:41:48.476
We'd love to stay and chat,
but we have an important wedding to attend


1303
01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:51.685
and it turns out,
we have the perfect gift.


1304
01:41:52.268 --> 01:41:53.726
No hard feelings, pal.

1305
01:41:55.226 --> 01:41:56.351
It's what we do.

1306
01:41:57.018 --> 01:41:59.518
None taken. Super fun time, guys.

1307
01:42:00.393 --> 01:42:02.643
See, I always appreciate
a quality double-cross.


1308
01:42:03.518 --> 01:42:05.518
Serious question though,
you guys have any sunblock?


1309
01:42:05.601 --> 01:42:07.685
I have no base. 
This is a spray tan.

1310
01:42:16.851 --> 01:42:22.143
A beautiful event like tonight
happens only once in a father's life.


1311
01:42:22.851 --> 01:42:27.268
That is why when I arranged
for my only daughter to marry,


1312
01:42:27.351 --> 01:42:32.310
I spared no expense
to acquire a gift unlike any other.


1313
01:42:37.476 --> 01:42:40.185
A gift fit for a queen,

1314
01:42:41.685 --> 01:42:43.101
my Cleopatra.

1315
01:42:45.393 --> 01:42:49.018
Behold,
for the first time in two millennia,


1316
01:42:49.101 --> 01:42:52.393
all three treasured eggs
have been reunited.


1317
01:43:11.143 --> 01:43:12.726
Oh, my God! Ed…

1318
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:15.935
Ed Sheeran!

1319
01:43:17.226 --> 01:43:18.643
I love you!

1320
01:43:20.643 --> 01:43:22.518
Ed Sheeran, who knew?

1321
01:43:22.601 --> 01:43:23.851
God, he's so cute.

1322
01:43:35.393 --> 01:43:36.351
Yeah, I like that guy.

1323
01:43:36.435 --> 01:43:39.060
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>This is an Interpol police action.</i>


1324
01:43:39.143 --> 01:43:41.851
<i>Remain in your seats.</i>
<i>This will be over shortly.</i>


1325
01:43:44.976 --> 01:43:45.976
What are you doing?

1326
01:43:48.018 --> 01:43:49.476
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


1327
01:43:50.435 --> 01:43:53.185
- Oh, my God. Don't touch me. Excuse me!
- Oi!


1328
01:43:54.351 --> 01:43:56.935
Come on, then. Come on! Come on!

1329
01:43:59.685 --> 01:44:02.101
We'll take those. 
Thank you very much.

1330
01:44:02.685 --> 01:44:04.435
- Let's get out of here.

1331
01:44:07.018 --> 01:44:09.060
Possession of stolen Nazi loot is a crime.

1332
01:44:09.143 --> 01:44:11.185
You're under arrest, father of the bride.

1333
01:44:11.268 --> 01:44:13.226
This is outrageous.

1334
01:44:16.476 --> 01:44:19.060
Get off me.
Do you know who I am?


1335
01:44:19.643 --> 01:44:21.226
I was in <i>Game of Thrones!</i>

1336
01:44:21.768 --> 01:44:23.393
I'm Ed Sheeran, bitch!

1337
01:44:23.476 --> 01:44:26.893
1338

1339
01:44:52.810 --> 01:44:55.768
Such a fancy yacht, you'd think
they could stock some decent cheeses.


1340
01:44:56.518 --> 01:44:59.560
That's not cheese. 
That's uncooked pork.

1341
01:45:01.851 --> 01:45:03.976
I've heard tapeworms
can be quite slimming.


1342
01:45:04.643 --> 01:45:06.060
Surprised to see me?

1343
01:45:06.143 --> 01:45:08.560
Well, we're just surprised
it took you so long to find us.


1344
01:45:08.643 --> 01:45:10.685
Oh, I actually… I came aboard yesterday.

1345
01:45:11.351 --> 01:45:14.060
You weren't the only one crying
at the end of your lovemaking.


1346
01:45:14.143 --> 01:45:17.226
<i>You know, funny story,</i>
<i>after Das picked me up on the beach…</i>


1347
01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:18.560
Looks like you ran out of friends.

1348
01:45:18.643 --> 01:45:21.435
<i>She sent me to the only place</i>
<i>on Earth that actually is worse</i>


1349
01:45:21.518 --> 01:45:22.810
<i>than her Instagram account.</i>

1350
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:25.393
<i>But then I remembered</i>

1351
01:45:25.476 --> 01:45:28.018
<i>that I'm pretty good</i>
<i>at escaping from things.</i>


1352
01:45:28.768 --> 01:45:29.726
<i>So I did.</i>

1353
01:45:33.726 --> 01:45:36.643
Look, am I upset about
what happened back on the beach?


1354
01:45:36.726 --> 01:45:39.476
Absolutely not.
All's fair in love and eggs.


1355
01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:41.351
I came to congratulate you both.

1356
01:45:41.435 --> 01:45:43.310
Great. Glad you approve. 
What do you want?

1357
01:45:43.393 --> 01:45:46.185
Well, I'm big on forgiveness.
I always have been.


1358
01:45:46.268 --> 01:45:47.768
But I'm not so big on forget-ness.

1359
01:45:47.851 --> 01:45:49.393
What are you talking about?

1360
01:45:51.018 --> 01:45:52.851
I'm talking about my twist ending.

1361
01:45:52.935 --> 01:45:55.060
You know the 300 million
you guys got on the eggs


1362
01:45:55.143 --> 01:45:56.768
before you double-crossed the billionaire?

1363
01:45:56.851 --> 01:45:58.268
Nice touch, by the way.

1364
01:45:58.351 --> 01:46:00.685
Anyhow, I gave our friend,
Inspector Das, a little jingle


1365
01:46:00.768 --> 01:46:03.185
and I tipped her off about
that secure Cayman Island account


1366
01:46:03.268 --> 01:46:04.185
you stashed it in.

1367
01:46:04.268 --> 01:46:06.893
Turns out,
it's not as secure as one might hope.


1368
01:46:09.685 --> 01:46:10.768
Take it all.

1369
01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:17.018
See? Now, we're even.

1370
01:46:17.726 --> 01:46:20.768
Everyone loses, no one gets the money
and we can all be friends again.


1371
01:46:20.851 --> 01:46:22.518
Cut the shit. What's the offer?

1372
01:46:22.601 --> 01:46:23.643
There's a new score.

1373
01:46:23.726 --> 01:46:26.685
Double the payout, triple the challenge,
plus, here's the best part.


1374
01:46:27.310 --> 01:46:29.768
It's a three-thief job.
One, two, three.


1375
01:46:29.851 --> 01:46:31.810
And let me guess,
if we don't say yes,

1376
01:46:31.893 --> 01:46:34.268
then Inspector Das is on her way
right now to arrest us.


1377
01:46:34.851 --> 01:46:36.143
Yes, in very fast boats.

1378
01:46:36.685 --> 01:46:38.060
Know what I think is funny, Booth?

1379
01:46:38.143 --> 01:46:41.185
Vin Diesel's audition tape for <i>Cats?</i>
It exists.


1380
01:46:41.268 --> 01:46:44.268
The fact that you think
the two of us would ever team up with you.


1381
01:46:44.351 --> 01:46:45.351
Get off the boat.

1382
01:46:45.435 --> 01:46:48.268
Great. I'll, uh, send you both
a sharpened toothbrush.


1383
01:46:49.601 --> 01:46:51.185
Wait, stop.

1384
01:46:53.935 --> 01:46:56.435
Look,
we need a new score now anyway.


1385
01:46:56.518 --> 01:46:59.018
I know he drives
you crazy, but he's good.

1386
01:46:59.101 --> 01:47:01.560
- And you two work well together.
- No, we don't.


1387
01:47:01.643 --> 01:47:02.935
We kinda do.

1388
01:47:04.226 --> 01:47:05.601
Do you trust me?

1389
01:47:06.226 --> 01:47:07.060
Always.

1390
01:47:07.810 --> 01:47:09.768
- You love me?
- Big time.


1391
01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.226
That's all we need.

1392
01:47:14.768 --> 01:47:15.893
What are we stealing?

1393
01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:17.393
This.

1394
01:47:44.476 --> 01:47:47.226
It's abandoned.
They're not here.


1395
01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:08.393
Ready?

1396
01:48:09.143 --> 01:48:10.601
What could possibly go wrong?

1397
01:48:11.726 --> 01:48:12.643
Everything.

1398
01:55:30.851 --> 01:55:32.435
<i>Don't miss me too much.</i>

1399
01:55:32.518 --> 01:55:33.560
<i>Ta-ta!</i>
