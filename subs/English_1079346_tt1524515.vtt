1
00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:25.723
What the hell
you doin' here so early?


2
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.898
I'm movin'.

3
00:02:26.985 --> 00:02:28.943
Movin'? Where?

4
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.381
Here. You told me
you had a room.


5
00:02:31.468 --> 00:02:34.035
You outta your mind?
I said I'd see.


6
00:02:34.122 --> 00:02:35.646
I gotta move now.

7
00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:38.213
It's my last week
at the halfway house,
I told you.


8
00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:39.606
You called, like,
a month ago.


9
00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:42.043
You told me you had a room.

10
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.915
Look, now's
not a good time.


11
00:02:47.484 --> 00:02:49.312
So, you gonna make me
sleep on the street?


12
00:02:56.406 --> 00:02:58.799
If you gave me some notice,
I could have had the place
in better shape.


13
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.848
Uh, it's fine.

14
00:03:03.935 --> 00:03:05.415
You gotta use
the basement entrance.


15
00:03:05.502 --> 00:03:07.330
I don't give out keys
to the store.


16
00:03:08.461 --> 00:03:09.636
This TV work?

17
00:03:09.723 --> 00:03:11.334
Yeah, nothin' fancy, though.

18
00:03:11.421 --> 00:03:13.074
You know, whatever channels
come free.


19
00:03:13.814 --> 00:03:15.338
And the bathroom
we share with the store,


20
00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:17.296
so don't leave
your stuff in there.


21
00:03:17.383 --> 00:03:19.733
- Anythin' else?
- Tour's over.


22
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.040
If you need anything else,
do without it.


23
00:03:22.127 --> 00:03:23.389
I'm goin' to sleep.

24
00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:26.479
Oh, I set up
that job for you.


25
00:03:26.566 --> 00:03:27.611
Oh, thanks, man.

26
00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:30.222
- Hey.
- Yeah?


27
00:03:30.831 --> 00:03:32.398
Welcome home.

28
00:04:06.954 --> 00:04:10.436
Come on, come on, come on.

29
00:04:10.523 --> 00:04:12.482
Fuck outta here
with that shit.


30
00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.353
Come on. Come on.

31
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.225
Come on. Let's go. Yeah, go on.

32
00:04:17.312 --> 00:04:18.836
Come on.

33
00:04:18.923 --> 00:04:20.577
Come on, that's it. That's it.

34
00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.884
- Yo, what's the deal here?
- Shh!


35
00:04:23.971 --> 00:04:25.582
You gonna fuck me up, bro!

36
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.152
Fuck!

37
00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.161
You just got me killed, yo.

38
00:04:41.424 --> 00:04:44.383
- Fuck this.
- You were sayin'?


39
00:04:47.778 --> 00:04:49.693
- No, nothin'.
- Nothin'?


40
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.435
I know I heard you
say something.


41
00:04:52.522 --> 00:04:54.001
I wa-
- I was just--

42
00:04:54.088 --> 00:04:56.874
Just-- just-just--
Just what?


43
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.356
I just-- I just said
I was leavin'.


44
00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.850
Man, you should see
your face.


45
00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:21.507
Here, check this out.

46
00:05:21.594 --> 00:05:24.075
This shit is fire, bro.
Real talk.


47
00:05:24.162 --> 00:05:26.469
Snub nose.
Old school, bro.


48
00:05:28.253 --> 00:05:31.038
Check out the Beretta.
Real work of art.


49
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.346
Glocks, baby.

50
00:05:34.433 --> 00:05:36.740
Only five pounds
of trigger pressure.


51
00:05:36.827 --> 00:05:39.656
So your aim? Never off.

52
00:05:39.743 --> 00:05:42.615
Each mag holds 15 rounds.
Got two of 'em.


53
00:05:45.705 --> 00:05:47.402
Yeah, I'll take 'em all.

54
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:10.861
Jesus Christ.
Why you gotta dress like that?
It's embarrassing.


55
00:06:10.948 --> 00:06:13.690
I said "low-key."
You look like a fuckin'
rodeo clown.


56
00:06:13.777 --> 00:06:15.082
Fuck off.

57
00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.215
What took you so long?
Where's my shit?


58
00:06:24.004 --> 00:06:25.266
Are you for real, Mike?

59
00:06:25.353 --> 00:06:26.790
You carryin' around those
in broad daylight


60
00:06:26.877 --> 00:06:28.269
in a paper bag?

61
00:06:28.356 --> 00:06:30.576
What's the big deal?
I got 'em here, didn't I?


62
00:06:30.663 --> 00:06:32.752
Yeah. And what if the bag
ripped, huh?


63
00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:35.146
When are you gonna learn
how to use your fuckin' head?


64
00:06:36.843 --> 00:06:37.888
Fucking guy.

65
00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:40.586
Ah, real mature.

66
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.076
Alright, Ma.
It's all set.


67
00:06:52.163 --> 00:06:54.339
- Let me show you how to use it.
- My fan is fine.


68
00:06:55.122 --> 00:06:56.167
Come, eat somethin'.

69
00:06:57.385 --> 00:06:58.473
I'm fine.

70
00:07:00.867 --> 00:07:02.434
You know what today is?

71
00:07:03.348 --> 00:07:04.741
Yes, Ma, I know.

72
00:07:04.828 --> 00:07:06.830
His parole is over today.

73
00:07:06.917 --> 00:07:09.049
That animal is now
completely free


74
00:07:09.136 --> 00:07:11.574
while my son
rots in the earth.


75
00:07:14.054 --> 00:07:17.362
And there's nothing
we can do, Eli. Nothing.


76
00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:19.582
How could they do this to us?

77
00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:21.061
How?

78
00:07:21.148 --> 00:07:23.411
Ma, he's not worth
talkin' about anymore.


79
00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:36.424
- Please don't cry.
- Don't make a fuss.


80
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.386
I'll check on you tomorrow.

81
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.301
Alright?

82
00:08:00.753 --> 00:08:02.146
You're late, again.

83
00:08:02.233 --> 00:08:04.235
Hey, I'm-I'm--
I'm sorry, alright?


84
00:08:04.322 --> 00:08:07.281
I don't wanna hear it.
You can stay home
or come in early. You hear me?


85
00:08:07.368 --> 00:08:08.500
It wasn't my fault
this time, alright?


86
00:08:08.587 --> 00:08:09.980
This is the second time
this week.


87
00:08:10.067 --> 00:08:11.634
Last time I'm warning you.

88
00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:13.810
You're lucky you work fast
or you'd be gone.


89
00:08:21.078 --> 00:08:23.428
Alright,
Adam DeSalvo.


90
00:08:24.603 --> 00:08:25.996
Any contact with the law?

91
00:08:26.083 --> 00:08:27.867
- No.
- Any drugs or alcohol?


92
00:08:27.954 --> 00:08:28.912
No.

93
00:08:28.999 --> 00:08:30.522
Are you still working?

94
00:08:30.609 --> 00:08:34.221
Actually, I got a new job
and I moved.


95
00:08:34.308 --> 00:08:35.745
What job?

96
00:08:35.832 --> 00:08:37.355
Bartending.

97
00:08:37.442 --> 00:08:39.270
A bar?

98
00:08:39.357 --> 00:08:40.837
You're in violation
of parole.


99
00:08:40.924 --> 00:08:42.099
I haven't been there
after curfew,


100
00:08:42.186 --> 00:08:43.361
and I haven't started yet.

101
00:08:44.971 --> 00:08:46.364
You lyin' to me?

102
00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:47.974
No, I'm not lyin'.

103
00:08:49.323 --> 00:08:50.411
Where's the bar?

104
00:08:52.544 --> 00:08:54.024
Red Hook.

105
00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:56.417
That's your restricted zone.
What are you doing there?


106
00:08:56.504 --> 00:08:58.811
I just told you, I got a job.

107
00:09:00.204 --> 00:09:01.466
That's two violations.

108
00:09:03.424 --> 00:09:04.512
Come on.

109
00:09:05.383 --> 00:09:07.167
This is my last day.

110
00:09:07.254 --> 00:09:10.127
For three years, I've done
everything I was supposed to.


111
00:09:10.214 --> 00:09:12.607
I haven't had any trouble
or any violations.


112
00:09:14.784 --> 00:09:17.525
You know, just because you kept
your nose clean don't mean shit.


113
00:09:17.612 --> 00:09:19.266
It's not too late
for you to fuck up.


114
00:09:19.353 --> 00:09:21.268
One complaint
and you can wind up back inside.


115
00:09:21.355 --> 00:09:23.009
- Do you understand that?
- Are we done?


116
00:09:25.359 --> 00:09:26.491
That's it.

117
00:09:27.622 --> 00:09:30.234
You'll get your certificate
in a couple of months.


118
00:09:30.321 --> 00:09:31.539
If you're not locked up by then

119
00:09:31.626 --> 00:09:33.106
you can come
pick it up yourself.


120
00:10:07.401 --> 00:10:08.751
Welcome.

121
00:10:08.838 --> 00:10:10.970
Welcome, my friends.

122
00:10:11.666 --> 00:10:12.798
Leff?

123
00:10:12.885 --> 00:10:15.279
Yeah, it's my nephew, Mike.

124
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.672
Jamal.

125
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.110
Please, come in.

126
00:10:32.296 --> 00:10:33.558
Take a seat.

127
00:10:37.083 --> 00:10:40.565
One P and three ounces
of C, right?


128
00:10:40.652 --> 00:10:41.740
Yeah.

129
00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.047
That's it?

130
00:10:44.134 --> 00:10:46.919
Let's start there.
If we like it, we'll get more.


131
00:10:47.006 --> 00:10:48.268
You won't like it.

132
00:10:49.139 --> 00:10:50.401
You'll love it.

133
00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:00.280
Hmm.

134
00:11:02.065 --> 00:11:03.414
You're gonna wish you had more.

135
00:11:04.589 --> 00:11:06.896
Yeah.

136
00:11:36.621 --> 00:11:38.841
I got some great stuff
comin' in.


137
00:11:38.928 --> 00:11:41.495
Clean smack, pure.

138
00:11:41.582 --> 00:11:44.020
Can cut that shit to death.

139
00:11:44.107 --> 00:11:45.848
Great price.

140
00:11:45.935 --> 00:11:49.721
You make 30,

141
00:11:51.244 --> 00:11:52.767
We're definitely interested.

142
00:11:52.855 --> 00:11:55.509
- We don't mess with H.
- Uh, we could use the cash.


143
00:11:55.596 --> 00:11:57.555
Shut your fuckin' mouth!

144
00:12:00.297 --> 00:12:01.428
We're not interested.

145
00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:03.430
Hmm.

146
00:12:03.517 --> 00:12:05.345
I'm just tryin' to help you.

147
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.392
You're passin' up a gift.

148
00:12:09.697 --> 00:12:12.352
A gift implies
some sort of surprise.


149
00:12:14.877 --> 00:12:16.966
I don't like surprises.

150
00:12:17.053 --> 00:12:19.098
You didn't have to treat me
like a piece of shit back there.


151
00:12:19.185 --> 00:12:21.274
You're talkin' too much
on these runs.


152
00:12:21.361 --> 00:12:23.494
No need to speak
unless spoken to.


153
00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:25.626
She was speakin'
to both of us, was she not?


154
00:12:33.504 --> 00:12:35.810
I mean, what the fuck
was the point of me
even being there today?


155
00:12:35.898 --> 00:12:39.205
To listen. Watch. Learn.

156
00:12:41.468 --> 00:12:42.817
You see that bitch back there?

157
00:12:42.905 --> 00:12:44.297
Anyone who talks
to you like that,


158
00:12:44.384 --> 00:12:46.691
like they're doin' you
a favor, is full of shit.


159
00:12:46.778 --> 00:12:48.040
You're just paranoid.

160
00:12:48.127 --> 00:12:49.781
Damn right,
I'm fuckin' paranoid.


161
00:12:49.868 --> 00:12:51.565
It's what keeps my mind sharp.

162
00:12:51.652 --> 00:12:53.002
And you definitely
need to sharpen


163
00:12:53.089 --> 00:12:55.439
what's ever under
that stupid hat of yours.


164
00:12:55.526 --> 00:12:57.484
She was offering us
a good deal.


165
00:13:01.184 --> 00:13:03.229
You know, if I didn't promise
your mother


166
00:13:03.316 --> 00:13:05.188
that I'd look after you,

167
00:13:05.275 --> 00:13:06.841
I wouldn't be wasting
my fuckin' time.


168
00:13:06.929 --> 00:13:09.844
Look after me? Fuck off.

169
00:13:09.932 --> 00:13:13.848
I really do hope this,
uh, rock and roll shit
works out for you, I really do.


170
00:13:13.936 --> 00:13:16.416
Yeah, well, at least
I'm doin' something.


171
00:13:16.503 --> 00:13:17.548
Right.

172
00:13:18.375 --> 00:13:21.160
Where is this, uh, band
you've been puttin' together


173
00:13:21.247 --> 00:13:22.857
the last five years, huh?

174
00:13:27.819 --> 00:13:28.951
Grow up, Mike.

175
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.520
There's nothin' special
about wantin' to be special.


176
00:13:33.607 --> 00:13:35.566
It's the most ordinary thing
in the world.


177
00:14:06.466 --> 00:14:07.902
Hey, Donna.

178
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.688
You got some balls
comin' over here.


179
00:14:11.689 --> 00:14:14.039
You don't even call
and ask if it's okay?


180
00:14:14.126 --> 00:14:16.433
I thought you'd be
happy to see me.


181
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.782
You shouldn't be here.

182
00:14:20.915 --> 00:14:22.178
I just wanna talk.

183
00:14:22.265 --> 00:14:25.311
Look, I'm happy for you,
but I can't do this.


184
00:14:25.398 --> 00:14:27.096
You make another surprise visit
and I'll call the cops.


185
00:14:27.183 --> 00:14:28.749
Hey, come on.

186
00:14:41.197 --> 00:14:43.851
Hey, Halloween's over, huh?

187
00:14:43.938 --> 00:14:45.549
When you gonna return
that costume?


188
00:14:45.636 --> 00:14:47.812
- Yeah, blow me.
- So, what are you
gonna be next year?


189
00:14:47.899 --> 00:14:50.423
- Like a fuckin' spaceman, huh?
- That's enough.


190
00:14:51.337 --> 00:14:53.383
Sicky, can I talk to you?

191
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:55.341
That last shit you fuckin'
gave me was garbage, alright?


192
00:14:55.428 --> 00:14:57.778
Get the fuck out of here.
It's the same as it always is.


193
00:14:57.865 --> 00:15:00.216
I ain't messing around,
Sicky, alright?
You're not gonna rip me off.


194
00:15:00.303 --> 00:15:02.392
That shit was trash,
and you fuckin'-- Oh!


195
00:15:02.479 --> 00:15:04.394
Okay! Okay, alright, alright,
right, right!


196
00:15:04.481 --> 00:15:06.222
- Hold on, hold on.
- I'm gonna break it, asshole.


197
00:15:06.309 --> 00:15:08.615
- Hmm? Hey, Leff.
- Okay, okay, okay! I'm sorry!


198
00:15:08.702 --> 00:15:10.617
How far you think he got
his arm up his ass, huh?


199
00:15:10.704 --> 00:15:12.489
Alright, alright,
alright, alright, alright!


200
00:15:12.576 --> 00:15:15.927
Okay. Okay, alright, alright.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


201
00:15:16.014 --> 00:15:17.015
Let him go.

202
00:15:17.102 --> 00:15:19.365
Get out of here!

203
00:15:22.325 --> 00:15:24.501
You know, next time
I will break something.


204
00:15:24.588 --> 00:15:27.808
Sicky, I just...
I was coming to get--
get more shit, okay?


205
00:15:34.598 --> 00:15:36.600
This is extra
for bein' an asshole.


206
00:15:42.954 --> 00:15:44.651
- I appreciate it.
- Get the fuck...


207
00:15:49.613 --> 00:15:51.136
Fuckin' asshole.

208
00:15:53.182 --> 00:15:54.139
Yo.

209
00:15:59.057 --> 00:16:00.624
See anyone
from back in the day?


210
00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:01.973
Like who?

211
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.454
I don't know.
You ever see Johnny?


212
00:16:04.541 --> 00:16:06.412
Nah, he's gone.

213
00:16:06.499 --> 00:16:08.719
Married some chick
in Long Island
and moved out there.


214
00:16:08.806 --> 00:16:11.287
Hmm. How about Anthony?

215
00:16:11.374 --> 00:16:14.594
No, he got dropped,
like, five years ago.


216
00:16:14.681 --> 00:16:16.509
- No shit.
- He was fucked up one night


217
00:16:16.596 --> 00:16:18.294
and started shit
with these Dominicans.


218
00:16:18.381 --> 00:16:19.860
Some asshole stabbed him.

219
00:16:23.647 --> 00:16:24.909
You ever see my kid?

220
00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.698
Come on, I'm just askin'.

221
00:16:32.873 --> 00:16:33.918
What's he like?

222
00:16:34.005 --> 00:16:35.267
I don't fuckin' know.

223
00:16:35.354 --> 00:16:37.574
I never really speak
to him or nothin'.


224
00:16:37.661 --> 00:16:38.792
You think you can help me out?

225
00:16:38.879 --> 00:16:40.272
I'm already helpin' you out.

226
00:16:43.362 --> 00:16:44.755
I wanna see him, Steve.

227
00:16:44.842 --> 00:16:47.018
Look, I don't wanna get
in the middle. I told you.


228
00:16:47.105 --> 00:16:48.759
I don't really know the kid.

229
00:16:48.846 --> 00:16:50.761
I don't even know
what he looks like.


230
00:16:50.848 --> 00:16:52.589
Just, like,
point him out to me.


231
00:16:52.676 --> 00:16:53.981
You need to keep
the past behind you


232
00:16:54.068 --> 00:16:55.896
and stop tryin' to stir shit up.

233
00:16:55.983 --> 00:16:59.291
Come on, man.
All these years,
I haven't seen him.


234
00:17:01.728 --> 00:17:02.990
I just wanna see him.

235
00:17:12.086 --> 00:17:13.566
Now, usually he's around here.

236
00:17:15.742 --> 00:17:18.005
I don't see him.
Maybe the courts.


237
00:17:19.224 --> 00:17:20.617
Oh!

238
00:17:20.704 --> 00:17:22.271
You slammed it!

239
00:17:25.448 --> 00:17:26.623
Is he here?

240
00:17:28.451 --> 00:17:30.409
Oh, yeah. There he is.

241
00:17:30.496 --> 00:17:32.455
- Where?
- Over there.


242
00:17:32.542 --> 00:17:35.109
Thirty-one.

243
00:17:36.154 --> 00:17:37.155
- Put it back.
-Oh!


244
00:17:37.242 --> 00:17:38.287
Yeah, nice one!

245
00:17:41.768 --> 00:17:42.856
Come on, man.

246
00:17:45.424 --> 00:17:47.034
Hey, what are you doin'?

247
00:17:47.121 --> 00:17:48.645
I'm gonna go shoot some hoops.

248
00:17:48.732 --> 00:17:50.429
Let's go.

249
00:17:50.516 --> 00:17:51.909
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Let's go.


250
00:17:51.996 --> 00:17:53.606
Check up. Check up.

251
00:17:53.693 --> 00:17:54.738
Oh, yeah.

252
00:17:55.826 --> 00:17:57.175
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

253
00:17:57.262 --> 00:17:58.829
Let's go. Let's go.
Winner's ball.


254
00:18:00.004 --> 00:18:01.571
- Check up.
- Let's go. Let's go.


255
00:18:01.658 --> 00:18:03.703
- I'm cuttin', I'm cuttin'.
- No, no, no, no, no, no!


256
00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:05.488
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

257
00:18:05.575 --> 00:18:07.141
- Oh!
- All the way, Tommy.
All the way, Tommy.


258
00:18:08.752 --> 00:18:10.623
Here we go. Ball up. Ball up.

259
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.234
- Come on, Jimmy, get up!
- You okay?


260
00:18:12.321 --> 00:18:13.757
I'm fine.

261
00:18:13.844 --> 00:18:16.238
- Check up. Check up.
- Here we go. Here we go.


262
00:18:16.325 --> 00:18:17.674
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
- Yeah.


263
00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:19.153
- Back to me, Tommy!
- No, no, no, no, no, no!


264
00:18:19.241 --> 00:18:20.372
Hey, yo. Yo!

265
00:18:20.459 --> 00:18:23.593
- Cut, cut, cut!
- Oh!


266
00:18:24.376 --> 00:18:26.770
- Yo, what the fuck, man?
- Oh, come on, we even now, man.


267
00:18:26.857 --> 00:18:28.902
- Fuck you mean "we even"? Even?
- Oh, did that hurt?


268
00:18:28.989 --> 00:18:30.295
- I'll fuck you up, man.
- Come on! I know you want it.


269
00:18:30.382 --> 00:18:31.992
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I'm not afraid of you...


270
00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:33.951
- Bitch! Come on!
- Listen, listen, listen.


271
00:18:34.038 --> 00:18:35.692
Leave the kid alone, man.
He's half your size.


272
00:18:35.779 --> 00:18:37.389
- Get the fuck out of my way.
- Come on! You got nothin'!


273
00:18:37.476 --> 00:18:39.609
- Don't be stupid.
- Who you callin' stupid?


274
00:18:39.696 --> 00:18:41.567
- Whoa!
- Yo, chill, man. Chill, man.


275
00:18:41.654 --> 00:18:43.613
- It's not worth it.
It's not worth it.
- Did you see that?


276
00:18:45.571 --> 00:18:47.399
Come on, man. Let's just play.

277
00:18:47.486 --> 00:18:49.749
Let's just play.
Ball up.


278
00:18:49.836 --> 00:18:51.229
- Let's just play, man. Come on.
- Come on.


279
00:18:51.316 --> 00:18:52.926
- Let's just play.
- Let's forget it.


280
00:18:53.013 --> 00:18:55.102
- Come on. Let's play.
- Here we go. Here we go.


281
00:18:55.189 --> 00:18:56.843
Check up. Check up.

282
00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:04.198
That's how you make a
play. Good play. Good play.


283
00:19:04.286 --> 00:19:05.896
- There you go.
- That's it.


284
00:19:05.983 --> 00:19:08.507
Me? No, it's him, dude.
He started it.


285
00:19:08.594 --> 00:19:11.554
- It's part of the game.
It's not that big a deal.
- Yeah, see you later.


286
00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:13.077
- No, you good, man.
- See ya.


287
00:19:15.949 --> 00:19:17.995
Hey, yo.

288
00:19:18.082 --> 00:19:19.910
- Why'd you do that?
- Do what?


289
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.087
Are you just gonna take
that hit?


290
00:19:23.174 --> 00:19:24.871
You should've dropped
his bum ass.


291
00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:26.264
There's no point, man.

292
00:19:26.351 --> 00:19:27.918
Nothing good
would've come of it.


293
00:19:28.005 --> 00:19:30.050
No, you gotta set dudes
straight out here, alright?


294
00:19:30.137 --> 00:19:31.835
You gotta let 'em know
they can't fuck with you.


295
00:19:31.922 --> 00:19:35.317
Yo, listen. You gotta control
that shit or it will take over.


296
00:19:36.405 --> 00:19:38.276
Huh. By "control that shit,"

297
00:19:38.363 --> 00:19:40.844
do you mean letting dudes
punch you in the face?


298
00:19:40.931 --> 00:19:42.149
'Cause fuck that.

299
00:19:43.412 --> 00:19:47.459
Might wanna change
your philosophy.
"Control your shit."


300
00:19:54.161 --> 00:19:55.815
Hey. Is he always like that?

301
00:19:55.902 --> 00:19:57.034
That's just Jimmy.

302
00:19:58.165 --> 00:19:59.166
Fuck.

303
00:20:21.841 --> 00:20:22.886
He's not here yet?

304
00:20:22.973 --> 00:20:25.367
Nah, he flaked.

305
00:20:27.281 --> 00:20:28.761
You said this guy
had his shit together.


306
00:20:28.848 --> 00:20:30.850
Well, it sounded like it
on the phone.


307
00:20:30.937 --> 00:20:33.549
Now we'll keep lookin'.
Good drummers are hard to find.


308
00:20:35.638 --> 00:20:37.074
So, we got no one else lined up?

309
00:20:37.161 --> 00:20:39.381
Nope. You wanna do it right,

310
00:20:39.468 --> 00:20:41.905
we should go to fuckin'
Austin or Nashville.


311
00:20:43.123 --> 00:20:44.560
Bro, I'm not doing this again.

312
00:20:49.173 --> 00:20:53.090
Oh, man. People love music
down there.


313
00:20:53.177 --> 00:20:56.789
You know, there's--
there's real musicians,
real places to play,


314
00:20:56.876 --> 00:20:58.182
and you don't even
have to be good.


315
00:20:58.269 --> 00:20:59.618
Mm. People still like it.

316
00:20:59.705 --> 00:21:01.751
I'm tired of talkin' about this.
Let's just play.


317
00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:04.275
What's up with you?

318
00:21:04.362 --> 00:21:05.885
You're in a shit mood.

319
00:21:05.972 --> 00:21:07.931
My brother's killer
got off parole today,


320
00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:10.803
so it's been
a particularly shitty day.


321
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:12.892
- That's right.
- Yeah.


322
00:21:14.111 --> 00:21:18.158
Fuck it. We'll go out tonight,
have fun, get your mind off it.


323
00:21:18.245 --> 00:21:20.422
I can't. I got plans with Lori.

324
00:21:20.509 --> 00:21:23.512
Then fuckin' cancel 'em.

325
00:21:23.599 --> 00:21:26.123
Nah, man.
I really wanna see her.


326
00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:27.603
What's goin' on with that?

327
00:21:29.082 --> 00:21:30.954
Seemed like you wanted
to split for months.


328
00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:34.000
I don't know.
Maybe I was confused.


329
00:21:34.087 --> 00:21:36.612
No, you sounded
pretty clear to me.


330
00:21:36.699 --> 00:21:38.091
Look, dude, let's just play.

331
00:21:44.358 --> 00:21:46.578
Why didn't you call me
and tell me
you were comin' over early?


332
00:21:46.665 --> 00:21:49.102
- I would have got ready.
- What, I gotta make
an appointment?


333
00:21:49.189 --> 00:21:52.236
No, would have just been nice
to know you were coming.


334
00:21:52.323 --> 00:21:54.064
- How you doin', Keysha?
- Hey.


335
00:21:54.847 --> 00:21:56.153
What do you gotta do?
You look great.


336
00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.676
I have to get in the shower.

337
00:21:57.763 --> 00:22:00.592
- Good, I'll come.
- No, not now. Okay?


338
00:22:03.116 --> 00:22:04.596
So, where you guys going?

339
00:22:04.683 --> 00:22:07.207
Uh, to this, uh,
sushi place, Osari.


340
00:22:07.294 --> 00:22:09.427
- Cool.
- Mm-hmm.


341
00:22:10.646 --> 00:22:12.561
You guys think you can make it
through dinner without a fight?


342
00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.478
Yeah, well, things
are gonna be different now.


343
00:22:19.219 --> 00:22:22.614
I was in so deep,
I couldn't even imagine
a way to get out.


344
00:22:22.701 --> 00:22:24.398
I was shootin' every day

345
00:22:24.486 --> 00:22:26.966
and squatting
in this abandoned building.


346
00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.622
Next thing I know,
I'm in an emergency room.


347
00:22:32.102 --> 00:22:34.887
Nah. I'm lucky to be alive.

348
00:22:36.672 --> 00:22:38.325
Thanks to my higher power,

349
00:22:39.544 --> 00:22:41.546
I have six months under my belt.

350
00:22:43.679 --> 00:22:45.202
Thank you so much for sharing.

351
00:22:48.074 --> 00:22:49.554
Would anyone else like to share?

352
00:22:52.209 --> 00:22:53.210
Sure.

353
00:22:55.604 --> 00:22:57.344
I'm Adam, I'm an addict.

354
00:22:57.431 --> 00:22:58.737
- Hi, Adam.
- Hi, Adam.


355
00:23:00.391 --> 00:23:03.263
Did 13 years time,
three years parole.


356
00:23:04.351 --> 00:23:05.831
Today's my last day.

357
00:23:08.312 --> 00:23:09.661
I caught a habit inside,

358
00:23:09.748 --> 00:23:14.361
and, uh, I've been clean now
for five years.


359
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.019
But the really big news
is that, uh,


360
00:23:21.238 --> 00:23:23.806
I met my son for the first time
since he was a baby.


361
00:23:26.417 --> 00:23:28.854
You know, I thought about it
all these years,


362
00:23:28.941 --> 00:23:31.857
what it would be like
to meet him for the first time.


363
00:23:31.944 --> 00:23:33.772
Wow!

364
00:23:33.859 --> 00:23:34.817
Yeah.

365
00:23:36.035 --> 00:23:38.124
Yeah. You know, uh,

366
00:23:39.256 --> 00:23:42.346
when I was a kid,
we had to write
about our favorite heroes.


367
00:23:42.433 --> 00:23:44.609
And like most of the other kids,

368
00:23:44.696 --> 00:23:47.699
I think I wrote about Batman
or Spider-Man.


369
00:23:49.048 --> 00:23:50.310
But this one kid,

370
00:23:51.442 --> 00:23:52.878
he wrote about his father.

371
00:23:55.489 --> 00:23:57.535
And that just always
stuck with me, you know?


372
00:23:57.622 --> 00:24:00.059
Like, no superpowers,

373
00:24:00.146 --> 00:24:03.759
just an ordinary guy. And...

374
00:24:03.846 --> 00:24:06.196
his kid picked him
over Superman.


375
00:24:11.593 --> 00:24:14.726
I feel I got, like,
a second chance.


376
00:24:14.813 --> 00:24:17.686
I know I got
a second chance. And...


377
00:24:18.991 --> 00:24:20.602
after 16 years,

378
00:24:23.256 --> 00:24:25.563
I got hope.

379
00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:26.608
Yeah.

380
00:24:28.261 --> 00:24:30.960
Got a new job, new place.

381
00:24:34.006 --> 00:24:37.270
And, you know, even though
my ex slammed the door
in my face this mornin',


382
00:24:38.576 --> 00:24:39.969
I'm sure she was happy
to see me.


383
00:24:40.056 --> 00:24:41.361
She'll come around.

384
00:24:41.448 --> 00:24:42.580
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


385
00:24:42.667 --> 00:24:43.712
I don't know.

386
00:24:53.025 --> 00:24:54.984
This fuckin' traffic.
This a joke?


387
00:24:55.071 --> 00:24:57.508
People just can't fuckin' drive.
Come on! Thank you.


388
00:24:57.595 --> 00:25:00.206
So, um, why the sudden change?

389
00:25:00.293 --> 00:25:02.034
What happened?

390
00:25:02.121 --> 00:25:04.515
Look, the other night
I had this dream.


391
00:25:04.602 --> 00:25:07.474
And, uh, you found someone else.

392
00:25:07.561 --> 00:25:09.041
You wouldn't even talk to me.

393
00:25:09.128 --> 00:25:10.826
So, because you had a dream,

394
00:25:10.913 --> 00:25:13.045
now you wanna make things work.

395
00:25:13.132 --> 00:25:15.004
No. You--

396
00:25:16.353 --> 00:25:17.702
You're the only good thing
in my life.


397
00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:20.400
Yeah, you say that now.

398
00:25:20.487 --> 00:25:21.837
You know how much
is goin' on right now?


399
00:25:21.924 --> 00:25:23.490
I mean, all this shit
poppin' up with my Ma.


400
00:25:23.577 --> 00:25:25.928
Now this asshole's free.
Just, it's-- it's a lot!


401
00:25:26.015 --> 00:25:29.061
Yeah, I know. But you gotta
try and look past it.


402
00:25:29.148 --> 00:25:30.759
It's just fucked up, okay?

403
00:25:30.846 --> 00:25:32.935
Yeah, when something's over,
you gotta let it be over.


404
00:25:33.022 --> 00:25:34.980
- You gotta--
- I get it. I get it.
I fuckin' get it, alright?


405
00:25:35.067 --> 00:25:36.982
- Why're you getting mad?
- I'm not mad!


406
00:25:37.069 --> 00:25:38.984
- You're yelling at me.
- I'm just-- Come on!
I'm not fuckin' yellin'!


407
00:25:39.071 --> 00:25:41.291
- Right now
you were yelling at me!
- I'm not fuckin'--


408
00:25:41.378 --> 00:25:43.206
- If you're gonna be an asshole,
then just take me home.
- Oh, now I'm a fucking asshole?


409
00:25:43.293 --> 00:25:44.511
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Yeah, you are
a fuckin' asshole!


410
00:25:44.598 --> 00:25:45.948
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

411
00:25:46.035 --> 00:25:47.819
- I'm sorry. You okay?
- Just take me home.


412
00:25:47.906 --> 00:25:49.299
No, Lori, please. I'm sorry.
It was an accident!


413
00:25:49.386 --> 00:25:50.561
- Fucking take me home, okay?
- Lori, I'm sorry.


414
00:25:50.648 --> 00:25:52.650
Just stop the car!
Stop the fucking car!


415
00:25:52.737 --> 00:25:54.913
It was an accident!
Lori, it was an accident!


416
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.176
Lori, come on! Get back
in the fucking car, Lori!


417
00:25:57.263 --> 00:26:00.397
Come on! Lori!

418
00:26:00.484 --> 00:26:01.615
Fuck you!

419
00:26:15.629 --> 00:26:17.501
Not on the fuckin' table.

420
00:26:25.074 --> 00:26:27.076
I also got
a new source for Molly.


421
00:26:27.163 --> 00:26:29.382
Real clean, not speedy.

422
00:26:29.469 --> 00:26:30.819
No powder shit.

423
00:26:42.526 --> 00:26:43.919
Look who we found.

424
00:26:44.006 --> 00:26:45.572
Been a while.

425
00:26:45.659 --> 00:26:47.400
Oh, E.R., man, I was
gonna come to see you.


426
00:26:48.445 --> 00:26:49.838
Let's talk outside.

427
00:26:51.709 --> 00:26:53.842
Come outside with us.
It'll be fun.


428
00:26:59.369 --> 00:27:00.587
Okay! Okay.

429
00:27:05.114 --> 00:27:07.681
Pick him up.

430
00:27:07.769 --> 00:27:09.988
Okay.
Okay, wait. I--


431
00:27:10.075 --> 00:27:12.164
I just need a little more time.
I'm gonna get you everything
I owe you.


432
00:27:12.251 --> 00:27:13.426
I know you will.

433
00:27:13.513 --> 00:27:14.906
I swear I was gonna
come to see you.


434
00:27:14.993 --> 00:27:17.604
Please, please. Please,
I'm-- I'm sorry, man.


435
00:27:17.691 --> 00:27:19.345
Shh. I know, I know.

436
00:27:19.432 --> 00:27:20.869
I swear on my mother's life.

437
00:27:20.956 --> 00:27:24.089
I like you, so I'm gonna
give you a choice.


438
00:27:24.176 --> 00:27:26.396
Oh, my... Oh, my God,
thank you. Thank you.


439
00:27:27.223 --> 00:27:29.573
Oh, oh, fuck. Okay.

440
00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.488
Okay, wait.

441
00:27:31.575 --> 00:27:34.665
- Which eye do you want?
- No. God, no, please.


442
00:27:34.752 --> 00:27:36.841
- Pick one or I'm takin' both.
- No.


443
00:27:36.928 --> 00:27:38.408
- Oh, my God.
- This one...


444
00:27:38.495 --> 00:27:41.106
...or this one?

445
00:27:41.193 --> 00:27:42.455
God, no, please, stop.

446
00:27:42.542 --> 00:27:44.370
Better pick fast
before it's too late.


447
00:27:44.457 --> 00:27:46.764
No!
Oh, God, no, please stop!


448
00:27:46.851 --> 00:27:48.766
Okay, right, right!

449
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.905
Motherfucker,
got blood on my shit.


450
00:27:56.992 --> 00:27:59.908
- I would've killed you
just for that.
- Oh, fuck! Oh, God!


451
00:27:59.995 --> 00:28:04.434
Now get me my fuckin' money!

452
00:28:04.521 --> 00:28:06.001
Let's go back inside
and have a drink.


453
00:28:06.088 --> 00:28:08.003
Gotta go.

454
00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.028
Where the fuck is he?

455
00:29:17.115 --> 00:29:18.160
Right up here.

456
00:29:27.821 --> 00:29:30.389
Yo, guys, what's up?

457
00:29:30.476 --> 00:29:32.130
What the fuck?

458
00:29:32.217 --> 00:29:34.741
- Is this funny to you?
- What?


459
00:29:36.047 --> 00:29:37.831
I said,
"Do you find this funny?"


460
00:29:37.919 --> 00:29:39.529
No, man.

461
00:29:39.616 --> 00:29:42.488
Are you sure?
'Cause I heard
you find this hilarious.


462
00:29:44.099 --> 00:29:45.883
Sorry, man, I--
I didn't mean anything.


463
00:29:49.234 --> 00:29:51.671
Make sure you
and your fuckin'
idiot friends know


464
00:29:51.758 --> 00:29:52.934
no one fucks with Mike.

465
00:29:53.021 --> 00:29:54.631
Okay, okay, I got you.

466
00:30:13.041 --> 00:30:14.129
Toss him.

467
00:30:14.956 --> 00:30:16.392
My fucking pleasure.

468
00:30:29.796 --> 00:30:30.884
- Ugh.
- Hey.


469
00:30:32.234 --> 00:30:34.366
- You look good.
- What do you want?


470
00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:38.022
You said last time
I came without asking,
so I came to ask.


471
00:30:38.109 --> 00:30:39.589
Ask what?

472
00:30:39.676 --> 00:30:41.112
You know, Jimmy.

473
00:30:41.199 --> 00:30:42.635
Oh, my God.

474
00:30:42.722 --> 00:30:44.550
Don't you dare
even think about it.


475
00:30:44.637 --> 00:30:45.899
It's not like you think.

476
00:30:45.987 --> 00:30:47.901
You think you can just pop
into his life?


477
00:30:47.989 --> 00:30:50.643
I've worked really hard
to keep things together.


478
00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.429
I don't need him wondering
why all of a sudden
he's got some ex-con


479
00:30:53.516 --> 00:30:55.083
- calling him son.
- Hey.


480
00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.172
He doesn't know about you
and what you did.


481
00:30:57.259 --> 00:30:59.652
- Well, I wasn't gonna say any--
- Oh, fuck off.


482
00:31:00.697 --> 00:31:02.264
Just stay away!

483
00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.181
Wasn't gonna tell him anything.

484
00:31:19.672 --> 00:31:23.502
You don't answer your phone.
Where the fuck
were you last night?


485
00:31:23.589 --> 00:31:25.722
I didn't hear it.
I was rehearsing.


486
00:31:25.809 --> 00:31:29.073
Does wasting my time
really need practice?


487
00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.728
Gotta move some Molly today.

488
00:31:31.815 --> 00:31:33.599
- So?
- So I need you to pick it up


489
00:31:33.686 --> 00:31:35.036
from the new supplier.

490
00:31:36.124 --> 00:31:37.342
It's a sizable deal.

491
00:31:37.429 --> 00:31:40.171
- You get 200 for it.
- 200?


492
00:31:40.258 --> 00:31:41.738
Yeah.

493
00:31:46.482 --> 00:31:48.049
You should bring
someone with you.


494
00:31:52.792 --> 00:31:55.404
What the fuck
am I gonna do with this?


495
00:31:55.491 --> 00:31:57.536
This old piece of shit
probably doesn't even fire.


496
00:31:57.623 --> 00:32:00.017
There's not even a clip in here.
Give me one of the new ones.


497
00:32:00.104 --> 00:32:01.758
Give me one of them
handsome guns.


498
00:32:01.845 --> 00:32:03.064
Those are for sellin'.

499
00:32:04.065 --> 00:32:05.327
Look, you don't need to fire it.

500
00:32:05.414 --> 00:32:06.545
You just have to flash it

501
00:32:06.632 --> 00:32:08.156
so they know
you ain't fuckin' around.


502
00:32:10.245 --> 00:32:13.248
Make sure you see the shit
before you bring in the cash.


503
00:32:19.558 --> 00:32:22.126
You know what? Fuck this.

504
00:32:22.213 --> 00:32:23.649
Give me one of the new ones
or I ain't doin' it.


505
00:32:23.736 --> 00:32:24.868
Give me two of the new ones.

506
00:32:43.887 --> 00:32:45.584
I'm gonna need your car too.

507
00:32:45.671 --> 00:32:48.109
Lost your fuckin' mind?

508
00:32:48.196 --> 00:32:49.675
No one touches my car.

509
00:32:49.762 --> 00:32:52.330
It's gonna take longer then.

510
00:32:52.417 --> 00:32:54.115
Balls on this kid.

511
00:33:18.443 --> 00:33:20.358
What the fuck
do you want, pussy?


512
00:33:20.445 --> 00:33:22.230
What the fuck you doin'
around here, huh?


513
00:34:03.053 --> 00:34:04.620
- Blow it?
- Yeah.


514
00:34:15.196 --> 00:34:16.501
Here, take this.

515
00:34:16.588 --> 00:34:18.634
- You crazy?
- Just-- just take it.


516
00:34:48.098 --> 00:34:49.839
Uh, Leff-
- Leff sent me.

517
00:34:50.666 --> 00:34:51.667
Who?

518
00:34:52.755 --> 00:34:53.756
Um...

519
00:34:57.542 --> 00:34:59.979
Oh, shit.

520
00:35:00.066 --> 00:35:02.808
Uh, I'm, I'm--
I'm lookin' for Al.


521
00:35:02.895 --> 00:35:05.376
Who's asking?

522
00:35:05.463 --> 00:35:07.987
Did, did Leff not--
not call you?


523
00:35:08.074 --> 00:35:09.772
Who the fuck is Leff?

524
00:35:13.384 --> 00:35:15.647
I'm fuckin' with you.

525
00:35:15.734 --> 00:35:16.866
Come on in.

526
00:35:22.524 --> 00:35:23.829
You got my money?

527
00:35:23.916 --> 00:35:25.614
W-where's the shit?

528
00:35:25.701 --> 00:35:27.920
No cash, no shit.

529
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.621
I-I gotta see it first.
Then I'll get--
then I'll get the money.


530
00:35:40.977 --> 00:35:43.588
Geo, show him the shit.

531
00:35:52.554 --> 00:35:54.512
If that shit is not on the table
when I come back,


532
00:35:54.599 --> 00:35:56.471
we're gonna have
a fuckin' problem.


533
00:36:01.171 --> 00:36:03.042
Uh-oh.

534
00:36:03.129 --> 00:36:05.001
Go get my money, tough guy.

535
00:36:05.958 --> 00:36:06.959
Yeah.

536
00:36:08.657 --> 00:36:09.701
The-the bag.

537
00:36:13.749 --> 00:36:14.837
Watch my back.

538
00:36:15.838 --> 00:36:19.363
From the car? You, like,
you want me to call 911?
What do you want me to do?


539
00:36:20.146 --> 00:36:21.452
Shit.

540
00:36:21.539 --> 00:36:22.540
Nothing.

541
00:36:23.411 --> 00:36:24.455
Damn it.

542
00:36:35.466 --> 00:36:36.511
Just a minute.

543
00:36:53.963 --> 00:36:55.356
We're all happy here.

544
00:37:00.839 --> 00:37:04.365
You gotta chill.
This ain't fuckin' Scarface.


545
00:37:06.062 --> 00:37:08.020
Give your boy Leff my love.

546
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:17.378
Fuckin' Leff's gonna get me
killed one of these days.


547
00:37:18.466 --> 00:37:19.641
The dude's your uncle.

548
00:37:19.728 --> 00:37:21.556
No, he's an asshole.

549
00:37:21.643 --> 00:37:23.993
I take all the risks.
He takes all the cash.


550
00:37:25.821 --> 00:37:27.475
Then get your own shit goin'.

551
00:37:27.562 --> 00:37:30.478
Yeah, I've been thinkin'
about that.


552
00:37:30.565 --> 00:37:32.784
I was with Leff
at this woman Jamal's crib.


553
00:37:32.871 --> 00:37:35.613
She's got this great deal goin'.
It's-- it's pure heroin.


554
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.136
She was telling Leff

555
00:37:37.223 --> 00:37:39.182
he could make,
like, 40 grand profit.


556
00:37:40.139 --> 00:37:43.491
You gonna start
pushing H now?
You fuckin' crazy?


557
00:37:43.578 --> 00:37:47.669
N-no, let me finish.
We find out how much, right?


558
00:37:47.756 --> 00:37:51.150
Then we go to E.R.
and we tell him
we'll-we'll sell it to him.


559
00:37:53.022 --> 00:37:55.285
What do you mean "we"?
And who's E.R.?


560
00:37:55.372 --> 00:37:57.374
He's-he's one
of my uncle's dealers.


561
00:37:58.331 --> 00:38:00.856
Listen, we mark it up,
like, ten grand.


562
00:38:00.943 --> 00:38:03.424
Then we go and get
the money from E.R.,


563
00:38:03.511 --> 00:38:05.338
we buy it for him,
and that's fuckin' it.


564
00:38:05.426 --> 00:38:08.341
We can use that money
to get the fuck out of here
and head to Austin.


565
00:38:08.951 --> 00:38:10.648
And you say Leff's
gonna get you killed?


566
00:38:25.663 --> 00:38:27.056
Going to Bobby's place?

567
00:38:27.143 --> 00:38:28.884
I'm not tryin'
to go to Bobby's, man.


568
00:38:28.971 --> 00:38:31.147
- Why not?
- It was
some shit last time.


569
00:38:31.234 --> 00:38:32.975
Every time I gotta go,
and I see his dog and shit...


570
00:38:33.062 --> 00:38:34.585
- What breed dog does he have?
- He's better than Ricky.


571
00:38:34.672 --> 00:38:36.282
Cool. I'll do that.

572
00:38:36.369 --> 00:38:37.849
- Hey, yo!
- Yo.


573
00:38:37.936 --> 00:38:39.547
Uh, I'll catch up
with y'all, okay?


574
00:38:39.634 --> 00:38:40.591
Yeah.

575
00:38:41.897 --> 00:38:44.639
You, uh, been
controlling your shit?


576
00:38:44.726 --> 00:38:46.858
Yeah. You wanna smoke?

577
00:38:47.859 --> 00:38:49.165
No, thanks. I'm good.

578
00:38:49.252 --> 00:38:50.253
Alright.

579
00:38:51.428 --> 00:38:53.343
Damn. You drew that?

580
00:38:54.039 --> 00:38:55.040
Yeah.

581
00:38:57.739 --> 00:38:59.175
That's like really dope.

582
00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.961
Is that what you do?
You are-- are you like a--


583
00:39:03.048 --> 00:39:05.573
- an artist, a comic book guy?
- I wish.


584
00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.226
Those guys make
pretty good bread.


585
00:39:09.054 --> 00:39:10.142
You draw?

586
00:39:10.839 --> 00:39:13.711
Me? Nah. I suck at that shit.

587
00:39:13.798 --> 00:39:15.060
You ever try?

588
00:39:16.497 --> 00:39:19.456
No, like... No, you gotta be,
like, born with that, you know?


589
00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:23.504
It's-- it's like learnin'
to write your name, you know?


590
00:39:23.591 --> 00:39:25.810
You-you write it enough times,

591
00:39:25.897 --> 00:39:28.030
you can write anything
without even thinkin' about it.


592
00:39:28.117 --> 00:39:30.336
Yeah, I mean,
that's a bit different.


593
00:39:30.423 --> 00:39:32.513
Alright. Check this out.

594
00:39:33.296 --> 00:39:35.516
Dude, I just told you
I can't draw.


595
00:39:35.603 --> 00:39:36.691
- Alright.
- Just try.


596
00:39:38.257 --> 00:39:39.345
Use your board.

597
00:39:46.091 --> 00:39:48.964
Alright. Just copy what I do.

598
00:39:49.051 --> 00:39:50.574
- Yeah.
- Nice and simple.


599
00:39:51.662 --> 00:39:53.272
Make this shape.

600
00:39:53.359 --> 00:39:54.709
Yeah, okay.

601
00:39:57.189 --> 00:39:58.451
Just follow the line.

602
00:39:59.714 --> 00:40:00.758
Like that?

603
00:40:01.542 --> 00:40:02.630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

604
00:40:02.717 --> 00:40:04.196
Nice.

605
00:40:05.023 --> 00:40:08.070
Now, the one just below.
Another shape, just like this.


606
00:40:10.246 --> 00:40:11.552
Nice and simple.

607
00:40:13.466 --> 00:40:14.903
Yeah, you got it.

608
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:17.253
Let's stick some teeth
on his gums.


609
00:40:20.778 --> 00:40:21.736
Nice!

610
00:40:22.824 --> 00:40:25.000
Yeah, you got it. Yeah.

611
00:40:25.087 --> 00:40:26.871
How about some hair?

612
00:40:26.958 --> 00:40:28.220
Hair? Alright.

613
00:40:30.527 --> 00:40:32.181
- Yeah.
- Who is this guy?


614
00:40:34.052 --> 00:40:35.576
I don't even remember.

615
00:40:35.663 --> 00:40:37.969
I've been drawin' him
since I was a kid.


616
00:40:41.973 --> 00:40:43.192
- Shit.
- It's good.


617
00:40:43.279 --> 00:40:45.281
It's really good.
It's really good.


618
00:40:45.368 --> 00:40:47.022
I can't believe
I just did that.


619
00:40:51.374 --> 00:40:53.332
See? You're a natural.

620
00:40:54.595 --> 00:40:55.726
Yo, Jimmy!

621
00:40:56.597 --> 00:40:58.337
Yeah, I'll be right there!

622
00:40:59.295 --> 00:41:00.296
Um...

623
00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:02.385
can I keep this?

624
00:41:02.472 --> 00:41:03.386
Sure.

625
00:41:03.473 --> 00:41:04.909
- Yeah?
- You drew it.


626
00:41:05.475 --> 00:41:07.608
Yeah, I guess I did.

627
00:41:08.478 --> 00:41:11.307
Um, I'll see you around,
though, right?


628
00:41:11.394 --> 00:41:12.482
See you around.

629
00:41:34.156 --> 00:41:36.637
Wow! It's Guns
N' Fuckin' Losers.


630
00:41:36.724 --> 00:41:38.682
Steroids are workin', man.
You look good.


631
00:41:38.769 --> 00:41:41.032
Careful with that shit.

632
00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:56.308
Hundred each.

633
00:41:57.222 --> 00:41:58.833
- I thought you said 200.
- Yeah.


634
00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.095
One for you, one for him.

635
00:42:01.444 --> 00:42:03.359
Well, what the fuck, Leff?

636
00:42:03.446 --> 00:42:06.144
That's not what you said.
That's not what
you fuckin' said.


637
00:42:06.231 --> 00:42:08.712
- I could have been killed.
- That was a simple pickup.


638
00:42:08.799 --> 00:42:09.974
- A simple pickup?
- Hmm.


639
00:42:10.061 --> 00:42:11.628
I thought it was a sizable deal.

640
00:42:15.284 --> 00:42:17.155
If you believe that,
then you're dumber
than you look.


641
00:42:20.158 --> 00:42:22.552
E.R., how you doin'?

642
00:42:22.639 --> 00:42:24.293
- E.R.
- E.R., man, what's up?


643
00:42:29.907 --> 00:42:31.387
- That's E.R.?
- Yeah.


644
00:42:31.474 --> 00:42:33.171
The last shit was fire.

645
00:42:33.258 --> 00:42:35.478
Leff's right.
You are dumber than you look.


646
00:42:35.565 --> 00:42:37.567
- I gotta go.
- Don't you want your money?


647
00:42:37.654 --> 00:42:38.699
Keep it.

648
00:42:41.963 --> 00:42:43.138
It's that good shit.

649
00:42:43.965 --> 00:42:45.053
What about the Molly?

650
00:42:49.622 --> 00:42:52.190
I'm sellin' some guns
if you're interested.


651
00:42:52.277 --> 00:42:53.931
Alright. Bust 'em out.

652
00:42:54.018 --> 00:42:55.716
I got two Glocks.

653
00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:57.935
Tsk. Hurry the fuck up.

654
00:43:00.198 --> 00:43:03.114
- The other one?
- Eli's got it.


655
00:43:06.596 --> 00:43:08.816
You let him walk out
with my shit?
What the fuck you thinkin'?


656
00:43:08.903 --> 00:43:11.688
I'll get it back.
Do you want me to run after him?


657
00:43:11.775 --> 00:43:13.037
Don't you disappear!

658
00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:17.433
We gotta make a drop tonight.

659
00:43:20.175 --> 00:43:22.568
I just mopped and you're gonna
spill that all over my floor?


660
00:43:22.655 --> 00:43:24.005
I didn't spill anythin'.

661
00:43:41.457 --> 00:43:44.199
- What are you doin'?
- Where did you get this?


662
00:43:44.286 --> 00:43:46.288
- I drew it.
- Don't lie to me.


663
00:43:47.245 --> 00:43:48.986
- What the hell is your problem?
- Where did you get this?


664
00:43:49.073 --> 00:43:50.727
I just told you I drew--

665
00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:56.298
Oh, fuck.

666
00:44:00.302 --> 00:44:02.130
Fuckin'...

667
00:44:13.924 --> 00:44:15.621
Hey, Lenny.
How's it goin'?


668
00:44:15.708 --> 00:44:18.146
Hey. Same as every other day.

669
00:44:20.365 --> 00:44:24.152
Some asshole puked
behind the jukebox last night.


670
00:44:24.239 --> 00:44:26.458
Yeah, I know.
What's wrong with people?


671
00:44:26.545 --> 00:44:29.244
Oh, we've only got bottles.

672
00:44:29.331 --> 00:44:30.375
Nothing on tap.

673
00:44:31.246 --> 00:44:32.943
You jokin'?

674
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:35.119
Do I look like I'm joking?

675
00:44:35.206 --> 00:44:37.121
Anything in the bottles?

676
00:44:37.208 --> 00:44:38.470
Don't be a wise ass.

677
00:44:39.515 --> 00:44:41.647
Oh, and by the way,

678
00:44:41.734 --> 00:44:44.128
uh, the lights are fucked.

679
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:47.088
Good luck.

680
00:44:50.918 --> 00:44:52.745
You gotta be kiddin' me.

681
00:44:57.881 --> 00:44:59.883
- Glad you came.
- I'm not hungry.


682
00:45:01.667 --> 00:45:03.147
I know you're still pissed
about the other night.


683
00:45:03.234 --> 00:45:04.540
It's not just the other night.

684
00:45:04.627 --> 00:45:06.281
Babe, things are gonna be
different now, okay?


685
00:45:06.368 --> 00:45:07.499
- They will. I--
- Eli.


686
00:45:07.586 --> 00:45:09.762
- Let me finish.
- I can't do this.


687
00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:11.547
I know I've been really
messed up for a long time


688
00:45:11.634 --> 00:45:12.896
- and that's not your problem.
- Do you hear me?


689
00:45:12.983 --> 00:45:15.420
I'm done, okay? It's over.

690
00:45:15.507 --> 00:45:16.726
You don't mean that.

691
00:45:16.813 --> 00:45:18.684
Do you remember last month,

692
00:45:18.771 --> 00:45:20.904
when I told you how alone
and unwanted I felt?


693
00:45:20.991 --> 00:45:22.079
Do you remember
what you told me?


694
00:45:23.733 --> 00:45:27.041
- That was a mistake.
- You said,
"Then go find someone else."


695
00:45:27.128 --> 00:45:28.694
Is that what you're tryin'
to tell me?


696
00:45:28.781 --> 00:45:30.305
- You found someone else?
- That's not my point.


697
00:45:30.392 --> 00:45:31.567
But you did, right?

698
00:45:31.654 --> 00:45:33.264
Come on, Eli.

699
00:45:33.351 --> 00:45:34.962
We're just too different.

700
00:45:35.049 --> 00:45:37.181
Like we want different things.

701
00:45:37.268 --> 00:45:39.227
Like you love this place.

702
00:45:39.314 --> 00:45:40.793
I can't wait to get out of here.

703
00:45:41.751 --> 00:45:44.101
- This is your home.
- I hate it here.


704
00:45:44.188 --> 00:45:45.755
I don't wanna be
one of those bitter people


705
00:45:45.842 --> 00:45:47.670
who just let their lives
pass them by


706
00:45:47.757 --> 00:45:49.280
tryin' to make ends meet.

707
00:45:49.367 --> 00:45:51.152
I wanna see things.

708
00:45:51.239 --> 00:45:52.849
Go different places.

709
00:45:52.936 --> 00:45:54.720
There's nothin'
but fuckin' losers here.


710
00:45:56.505 --> 00:45:59.464
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean you.


711
00:46:00.639 --> 00:46:02.380
Please don't do this.

712
00:46:02.467 --> 00:46:03.904
How can you say it's over?

713
00:46:03.991 --> 00:46:05.296
'Cause it's been over.

714
00:46:05.383 --> 00:46:07.429
It's been over for a long time.

715
00:46:07.516 --> 00:46:08.560
But I love you.

716
00:46:09.779 --> 00:46:10.867
No, you don't.

717
00:46:28.406 --> 00:46:29.755
Patricia Earl's office.

718
00:46:29.842 --> 00:46:31.583
Hi, Miss Earl?

719
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:34.760
Hi, this is Donna.
Donna Taylor,
we've spoken before.


720
00:46:34.847 --> 00:46:37.502
Uh, yes, Miss Taylor.
What can I do for you?


721
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:40.331
I'm really upset.
Adam came by my house.


722
00:46:40.418 --> 00:46:43.247
Well, he came by twice,
actually.


723
00:46:43.334 --> 00:46:45.554
Did he hurt you?
Are you okay?


724
00:46:45.641 --> 00:46:48.383
No. No, no. Nothing like that.

725
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:50.733
Did something happen
or not, Miss Taylor?


726
00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:52.213
I don't want him around my son.

727
00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:54.171
Can you make sure
he stays away from us?


728
00:46:54.258 --> 00:46:56.652
My-my son
is very impressionable,


729
00:46:56.739 --> 00:46:58.480
and-and finding out about Adam

730
00:46:58.567 --> 00:47:00.264
could send him down
the wrong road.


731
00:47:00.351 --> 00:47:02.658
Y-you know, he know--
he knows nothing about him.


732
00:47:03.485 --> 00:47:06.575
I-I thought there was
some rule or law


733
00:47:06.662 --> 00:47:08.490
that he can't be
in this neighborhood.


734
00:47:08.577 --> 00:47:11.580
Adam's finished his parole.
I mean, he's a free man.


735
00:47:11.667 --> 00:47:13.930
I
-I can't force him to come in.

736
00:47:14.017 --> 00:47:16.019
Well, can you talk to him
outside the office?


737
00:47:16.846 --> 00:47:18.935
I mean, what happens
if my son does get hurt


738
00:47:19.022 --> 00:47:21.068
and your boss finds out
that I reached out to you?


739
00:47:21.155 --> 00:47:23.026
Okay, I understand that,
but I can't.


740
00:47:23.113 --> 00:47:26.508
I'm-I'm, I'm just asking you
to talk to him, not arrest him.


741
00:47:26.595 --> 00:47:29.119
I'm sorry you're upset,
but there's nothing I can do.


742
00:47:29.206 --> 00:47:31.208
Okay.

743
00:47:43.481 --> 00:47:45.527
I never thought
she'd actually end it.


744
00:47:45.614 --> 00:47:49.052
Sometimes people change
and it just doesn't work
anymore.


745
00:47:49.139 --> 00:47:50.358
It's no one's fault.

746
00:47:52.099 --> 00:47:55.015
Look at you. So wise.

747
00:47:55.102 --> 00:47:58.018
I'm just sayin' if you're
fightin' all the time,
then something's wrong, right?


748
00:47:58.105 --> 00:48:00.672
- Yeah, but everyone fights.
- Yeah. Yeah, maybe.


749
00:48:01.847 --> 00:48:03.893
Maybe it's time you move on.

750
00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:06.635
Considering she's seeing
someone else, yeah,
I-I would think so.


751
00:48:07.418 --> 00:48:08.680
She told you that?

752
00:48:08.767 --> 00:48:10.030
Not exactly, but...

753
00:48:11.292 --> 00:48:12.554
there's someone else.

754
00:48:12.641 --> 00:48:15.122
Yo, you ready?

755
00:48:15.209 --> 00:48:18.038
No, I'm-I'm feelin' this.
Go get a beer or something, huh?


756
00:48:19.909 --> 00:48:23.521
You won. Game over. Let's go.

757
00:48:27.743 --> 00:48:29.571
Alright. You wanna come with us?

758
00:48:29.658 --> 00:48:31.007
We're just gonna make
a quick drop.


759
00:48:31.094 --> 00:48:32.791
Nah, dude.
I'm gettin' out of here.


760
00:48:32.878 --> 00:48:34.184
Oh, come on, don't be weak.

761
00:48:34.271 --> 00:48:36.230
- Ah, I'm goin' home, yeah.
- Alright.


762
00:48:47.893 --> 00:48:48.981
Here you go.

763
00:48:50.418 --> 00:48:51.680
Thanks, handsome.

764
00:48:54.639 --> 00:48:56.337
Oh!

765
00:48:56.424 --> 00:48:58.034
- Come on.
- Boo!


766
00:48:58.121 --> 00:49:01.255
Sorry, guys.
It'll be fixed by tomorrow.


767
00:49:17.053 --> 00:49:18.750
- Let's go.
- One second. I'll be back.


768
00:49:36.768 --> 00:49:37.900
You know who that is?

769
00:49:39.031 --> 00:49:40.163
No. Who?

770
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:42.470
It's the guy who killed
Eli's brother.


771
00:49:42.557 --> 00:49:43.949
Comes back here
like nothin' happened.


772
00:49:44.036 --> 00:49:46.038
Fuckin' balls
on that guy, right?


773
00:49:46.126 --> 00:49:47.997
That asshole,
will be an easy score.


774
00:49:49.868 --> 00:49:51.783
Light work.

775
00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:53.133
What do you--
what do you mean?


776
00:49:54.351 --> 00:49:57.528
A guy tryin' to make it
on the outside,
don't want any trouble, huh?


777
00:49:58.834 --> 00:50:03.012
He'd hand the keys over easy.
Probably even thank us
when we leave. Hmm?


778
00:50:03.882 --> 00:50:05.928
Bitch-ass tryna make good,
motherfucker.


779
00:50:10.019 --> 00:50:11.455
It's one o'clock.

780
00:50:23.337 --> 00:50:24.686
Can we talk?

781
00:50:26.862 --> 00:50:28.385
What for?

782
00:50:28.472 --> 00:50:30.344
Why do you have
to fight me on everything?


783
00:50:42.138 --> 00:50:44.575
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

784
00:50:44.662 --> 00:50:47.796
But don't you ever raise
your hand to me again,
you hear me?


785
00:50:49.798 --> 00:50:53.236
Now can you please tell me
where you got that drawing?


786
00:50:53.323 --> 00:50:54.846
What is your fuckin' problem
with that--


787
00:50:54.933 --> 00:50:56.283
Don't curse at me, please.

788
00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:58.589
I told you I drew it, alright?

789
00:50:58.676 --> 00:51:00.983
Some guy in the park
showed me how.


790
00:51:02.898 --> 00:51:04.595
- That's it.
- Okay.


791
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:08.425
Okay.

792
00:51:11.298 --> 00:51:13.909
I'm sorry I called you a liar.

793
00:51:16.694 --> 00:51:18.957
What did that guy want?

794
00:51:19.044 --> 00:51:21.003
Nothin'. I don't know.

795
00:51:24.659 --> 00:51:25.660
Why?

796
00:51:27.227 --> 00:51:28.228
Well...

797
00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.100
he was here.

798
00:51:34.582 --> 00:51:35.626
You know him?

799
00:51:38.847 --> 00:51:39.848
Yeah.

800
00:51:41.415 --> 00:51:42.372
And?

801
00:51:43.547 --> 00:51:45.506
And...

802
00:51:45.593 --> 00:51:47.769
I never thought
he'd come back, but...


803
00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:49.988
he did.

804
00:51:55.994 --> 00:51:57.257
He's your father.

805
00:52:06.483 --> 00:52:07.441
What?

806
00:52:13.882 --> 00:52:15.144
Okay.

807
00:52:19.757 --> 00:52:22.760
- What does he want?
- Who knows and who cares?


808
00:52:22.847 --> 00:52:24.501
What do you mean?
Did, um, did you talk to him?


809
00:52:24.588 --> 00:52:27.069
- We don't need to talk to him.
- Why not?


810
00:52:27.156 --> 00:52:28.636
Nothing good
will come from that.


811
00:52:28.723 --> 00:52:30.942
- How-how do you know that?
- I just know, trust me!


812
00:52:31.029 --> 00:52:32.553
C-can you give me
a real answer?


813
00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:35.207
Look, nothing has changed.

814
00:52:35.295 --> 00:52:37.558
Like I always told you,
he left us and didn't care.


815
00:52:37.645 --> 00:52:38.907
There is nothing else to know.

816
00:52:38.994 --> 00:52:40.300
Nothing else to...

817
00:52:41.257 --> 00:52:42.867
My whole life,

818
00:52:42.954 --> 00:52:45.522
I go without seein' him,
knowing who he is.


819
00:52:45.609 --> 00:52:47.959
And you tell me there's
nothing else to know now.


820
00:52:48.786 --> 00:52:50.658
How can you even
say that to me, Mom?


821
00:52:50.745 --> 00:52:52.181
He has nothing to give you.

822
00:52:52.268 --> 00:52:54.662
- What does that mean?
- It means he's a liar!


823
00:52:56.316 --> 00:52:59.057
Did he tell you
he was your father
or did I just tell you?


824
00:52:59.144 --> 00:53:01.451
Where was he all these years?

825
00:53:01.538 --> 00:53:04.236
Where was he when you were
in the hospital? Nowhere.


826
00:53:07.849 --> 00:53:08.850
Look.

827
00:53:10.765 --> 00:53:11.983
Look at me.

828
00:53:13.594 --> 00:53:15.335
This is gonna be hard to hear.

829
00:53:16.945 --> 00:53:20.949
But he left us
because he didn't want us.


830
00:53:21.036 --> 00:53:24.561
He made his choices
and now we need to make ours.


831
00:53:25.649 --> 00:53:26.650
Okay?

832
00:53:28.739 --> 00:53:29.740
Okay?

833
00:53:33.875 --> 00:53:35.180
Thank you.

834
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:39.402
I love you.

835
00:53:54.548 --> 00:53:55.897
Where you goin', huh?

836
00:53:56.637 --> 00:53:59.161
- Huh?
- The fuck you doin'
around here?


837
00:54:00.684 --> 00:54:02.991
Hey, listen, look,
I don't want any trouble, okay?


838
00:54:03.078 --> 00:54:05.428
I thought you were badass,
hmm? You a badass?


839
00:54:05.515 --> 00:54:07.691
What's the matter, hmm?
I thought you were a killer.


840
00:54:07.778 --> 00:54:09.432
You're a murderer, right?

841
00:54:09.519 --> 00:54:11.565
You sick fuck. Huh?

842
00:54:18.006 --> 00:54:20.617
Fuck, you fuckin'--

843
00:54:29.104 --> 00:54:30.714
Motherfucker.

844
00:54:44.902 --> 00:54:46.600
Hello?

845
00:54:46.687 --> 00:54:48.863
You won't believe
who we just ran into.


846
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:50.691
Who?

847
00:54:50.778 --> 00:54:52.257
Adam DeSalvo.

848
00:54:53.389 --> 00:54:55.522
- Wait, what?
- You heard me.


849
00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:57.132
He works in that bar,
The Mirror.


850
00:54:57.219 --> 00:54:59.003
We just kicked the shit
out of that asshole.


851
00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:01.832
- You owe me big, man.
- You bein' serious?


852
00:55:01.919 --> 00:55:05.532
He is such a pussy, dude.
He didn't even fight back.


853
00:55:05.619 --> 00:55:09.013
No, no, he...
he can't be here.


854
00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:10.145
Well, he is.

855
00:55:10.972 --> 00:55:13.278
Dude, we should rip off
that bar and frame his ass.


856
00:55:13.365 --> 00:55:15.585
Oh, that reminds me.
I need to get that gun back.


857
00:55:15.672 --> 00:55:17.326
Leff's bustin' my balls
about it.


858
00:55:17.413 --> 00:55:20.329
Um, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

859
00:57:45.213 --> 00:57:46.301
So, how's the job?

860
00:57:47.258 --> 00:57:49.478
Yeah, it's alright.

861
00:57:49.565 --> 00:57:51.611
Place is pretty run-down,
but it's payin'.


862
00:57:53.874 --> 00:57:56.790
Still think it's a good idea
to be workin' at a bar?


863
00:57:56.877 --> 00:57:59.270
I doubt you came here
to hassle me about my job.


864
00:58:00.271 --> 00:58:01.533
What do you want?

865
00:58:02.534 --> 00:58:04.188
Donna called me.

866
00:58:04.275 --> 00:58:05.842
She wanted me
to come talk to you.


867
00:58:07.931 --> 00:58:09.585
Why? I haven't done anything.

868
00:58:09.672 --> 00:58:11.979
- Yeah, you went to see her.
- Yeah, it was just to talk.


869
00:58:12.066 --> 00:58:13.676
Yeah, and she's been
adamant about that.


870
00:58:13.763 --> 00:58:16.244
She doesn't want you
anywhere near them.


871
00:58:16.331 --> 00:58:19.116
- She doesn't feel safe.
- Huh, doesn't feel safe.


872
00:58:19.203 --> 00:58:21.162
God, I don't believe I...

873
00:58:21.249 --> 00:58:23.555
Listen, I...

874
00:58:23.643 --> 00:58:27.037
I do not need this shit
to come back on me.


875
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:29.953
You need to be careful.

876
00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.303
She could make one false claim

877
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:34.436
just to get you back in,
and it'll work.


878
00:58:39.006 --> 00:58:41.922
So, uh, she filed a claim?

879
00:58:44.011 --> 00:58:45.012
No.

880
00:58:46.753 --> 00:58:48.189
And I don't want her to.

881
00:58:50.887 --> 00:58:51.845
Hey,

882
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:54.804
stay clear of her
and the boy, alright?


883
00:58:56.414 --> 00:58:57.502
That boy...

884
00:58:59.287 --> 00:59:00.462
is my son.

885
00:59:02.551 --> 00:59:04.205
Hey, keep your head straight!

886
00:59:05.554 --> 00:59:07.077
Oh, man.

887
00:59:22.049 --> 00:59:23.224
Hungry?

888
00:59:23.311 --> 00:59:24.399
No, I ate.

889
00:59:25.792 --> 00:59:27.271
Can I talk to you
about somethin'?


890
00:59:27.358 --> 00:59:28.664
Sure, what's up?

891
00:59:30.492 --> 00:59:32.886
So, um, I was thinkin'...

892
00:59:34.757 --> 00:59:36.716
It's always a good start.

893
00:59:38.369 --> 00:59:39.806
I was thinkin', um...

894
00:59:42.547 --> 00:59:43.548
Um,

895
00:59:44.462 --> 00:59:46.726
I think I-- I think
I need to do somethin' else.


896
00:59:47.552 --> 00:59:50.512
It's about time you gave up
on that band shit.


897
00:59:50.599 --> 00:59:53.428
No. No, I mean, um...

898
00:59:55.082 --> 00:59:57.867
I don't wanna do
the kinda shit we do.


899
00:59:58.912 --> 00:59:59.869
Hmm.

900
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:03.133
What's the shit that we do?

901
01:00:04.656 --> 01:00:05.657
Look,

902
01:00:06.658 --> 01:00:08.573
I know you've been tryin'
to look out for me


903
01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:10.401
and-and-and help
and shit, but...


904
01:00:12.229 --> 01:00:14.449
I
-I can't do this anymore.

905
01:00:15.755 --> 01:00:19.019
It's just--
it's just not in me.


906
01:00:20.063 --> 01:00:22.762
I can't deal with it.
I fuckin' hate it.


907
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:24.938
Oh, I'm sorry, Mike,
you can't deal.


908
01:00:26.287 --> 01:00:29.507
You're so fuckin' special,
you need that special treatment.


909
01:00:29.594 --> 01:00:31.988
- Come on, man.
- "Come on"?


910
01:00:32.075 --> 01:00:33.642
Don't fuckin' "come on" me.

911
01:00:34.599 --> 01:00:38.038
I've been bustin' my fuckin' ass
to teach you, to help you,


912
01:00:38.125 --> 01:00:40.388
- and this is the thanks I get?
- No, it's not--


913
01:00:40.475 --> 01:00:42.085
- It's not like that.
- It's not like that?


914
01:00:42.172 --> 01:00:43.652
What's it like, huh?

915
01:00:45.175 --> 01:00:46.437
Tell me,

916
01:00:46.524 --> 01:00:48.178
how you gonna pay me rent?

917
01:00:51.921 --> 01:00:53.270
I don't pay you rent.

918
01:00:53.357 --> 01:00:56.926
Right. It's one of the perks
for workin' for me.


919
01:00:57.013 --> 01:00:59.363
You wanna go on your own way?

920
01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:00.669
Sure, fine.

921
01:01:01.888 --> 01:01:03.803
But then you gotta pay me rent.

922
01:01:04.978 --> 01:01:07.545
That's fine. Yeah, I will.

923
01:01:07.632 --> 01:01:09.069
How you gonna do that?

924
01:01:09.156 --> 01:01:10.200
I don't know.

925
01:01:12.072 --> 01:01:13.116
I don't know.

926
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:15.727
I don't know,
I'll figure it out.


927
01:01:18.295 --> 01:01:19.775
"Figure it out"?

928
01:01:19.862 --> 01:01:22.169
Mike, you're too fuckin' dumb
to figure it out.


929
01:01:22.256 --> 01:01:25.346
I've been caring you
ever since your mother OD'd.


930
01:01:26.913 --> 01:01:29.480
I never asked--
I never asked you to do that.


931
01:01:29.567 --> 01:01:34.007
Yeah, 'cause you're
too fuckin' stupid
to ask anythin'.


932
01:01:34.921 --> 01:01:36.836
You're a fuckin' asshole,
you know that?


933
01:01:36.923 --> 01:01:38.098
I'm the asshole?

934
01:01:39.055 --> 01:01:40.056
Mm-hmm.

935
01:01:41.101 --> 01:01:43.451
You've been a fuckin' burden
ever since you were born.


936
01:01:44.408 --> 01:01:47.498
And my sister
would probably still be alive


937
01:01:47.585 --> 01:01:50.110
if she didn't have the stress

938
01:01:50.197 --> 01:01:52.373
of havin' to fuckin' raise you.

939
01:01:55.289 --> 01:01:57.247
Don't talk about my mom.

940
01:01:57.334 --> 01:01:58.335
Hmm.

941
01:02:04.602 --> 01:02:06.691
Don't talk about my mom.

942
01:02:06.778 --> 01:02:08.955
Yeah, what are you
gonna fuckin' do, hmm?


943
01:02:09.042 --> 01:02:11.218
Get the fuck out of my house.

944
01:02:12.828 --> 01:02:15.135
Oh, you wanna be
a tough guy, hmm?


945
01:02:17.659 --> 01:02:19.704
You wanna be a tough guy?

946
01:02:19.791 --> 01:02:21.663
You wanna be
a fuckin' tough guy?


947
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:23.883
Get the fuck out of my house.

948
01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:27.538
Get the fuck out of my house!

949
01:02:55.523 --> 01:02:56.611
What happened?

950
01:02:56.698 --> 01:02:58.134
She collapsed at work.

951
01:02:58.221 --> 01:02:59.353
Oh, shit.

952
01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.702
It's her heart.

953
01:03:03.444 --> 01:03:06.403
Um, excuse me.
Can you tell me what's going on?


954
01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:07.709
You're her son?

955
01:03:07.796 --> 01:03:09.580
Yeah. Is-is--
Is she gonna be okay?


956
01:03:11.452 --> 01:03:12.975
She has heart failure.

957
01:03:14.498 --> 01:03:16.457
Okay, like--
like a heart attack?


958
01:03:16.544 --> 01:03:19.416
No, a heart attack
is when there's blockage
of blood flow to the heart.


959
01:03:19.503 --> 01:03:22.376
Heart failure
is a weakened heart.


960
01:03:22.463 --> 01:03:23.986
Okay, um...

961
01:03:24.073 --> 01:03:27.250
Has she been complaining
about feeling weak or tired?


962
01:03:27.337 --> 01:03:29.687
Um, no.

963
01:03:29.774 --> 01:03:31.907
I mean, the other day
she had a swollen leg,
but that's it.


964
01:03:31.994 --> 01:03:34.431
That was probably due
to her poor circulation.


965
01:03:36.085 --> 01:03:38.131
So-so now what?

966
01:03:38.218 --> 01:03:41.221
We're gonna do a full workup,
run some blood tests,


967
01:03:41.308 --> 01:03:43.788
look to determine the cause
and any underlying issues.


968
01:03:43.875 --> 01:03:45.703
Okay, w-well,
what if it happens again?


969
01:03:45.790 --> 01:03:47.923
She's in the right place.

970
01:03:57.672 --> 01:04:00.196
Yo. A little one-on-one?

971
01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:04.331
You up for it?
Or you scared I'll wax ya?


972
01:04:11.251 --> 01:04:12.208
Hey.

973
01:04:13.296 --> 01:04:14.341
What's with that?

974
01:04:17.822 --> 01:04:18.910
What do you want?

975
01:04:20.042 --> 01:04:23.524
To play daddy?
Is that why you're here?
To set my shit straight?


976
01:04:23.611 --> 01:04:25.482
Alright, she-she told you, huh?

977
01:04:25.569 --> 01:04:27.615
What's to tell?

978
01:04:27.702 --> 01:04:29.399
You fucked her and left.

979
01:04:29.486 --> 01:04:31.010
Hey, look, let me talk
to you, please.


980
01:04:31.097 --> 01:04:33.925
You know what?
Go fuck yourself.


981
01:04:34.013 --> 01:04:35.710
Look, I didn't wanna lie to you.

982
01:04:35.797 --> 01:04:37.712
Oh, no, you didn't
wanna lie to me, huh?


983
01:04:38.626 --> 01:04:41.629
You didn't wanna tell me
the truth of who you are.


984
01:04:41.716 --> 01:04:42.978
Where the fuck you've been?

985
01:04:45.111 --> 01:04:47.026
Everything about you is a lie.

986
01:05:08.917 --> 01:05:09.918
Yo.

987
01:05:12.964 --> 01:05:15.141
Oh, shit!

988
01:05:15.228 --> 01:05:17.230
- Fuck, Eli.
- Oh, yo, what the fuck?


989
01:05:17.317 --> 01:05:19.493
- You fuckin' kiddin' me?
- Wha--


990
01:05:22.191 --> 01:05:24.106
You piece of fuck!

991
01:05:24.193 --> 01:05:25.542
Stop! Stop!

992
01:05:25.629 --> 01:05:27.022
You're a fucking piece of shit!

993
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:29.894
- Just fucking stop!
- Fuck! Fuck!


994
01:05:41.993 --> 01:05:44.561
I totally fucked him.
We should've--
we should've told him.


995
01:05:44.648 --> 01:05:47.695
And what? Then he would
have been all mad
and hurt for no reason.


996
01:05:47.782 --> 01:05:49.784
- It'd been a mess.
- This is a fuckin' mess.


997
01:05:49.871 --> 01:05:51.133
Well, if he didn't
walk in on us,


998
01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.395
we would have just continued
with the plan


999
01:05:52.482 --> 01:05:53.962
and just let him think
we got together


1000
01:05:54.049 --> 01:05:55.964
like a few months
after the breakup.


1001
01:05:56.051 --> 01:05:59.402
He would have been happy
for both of us. You know that.


1002
01:05:59.489 --> 01:06:02.362
Yeah, well, it's fuckin'
too late for that.


1003
01:06:03.232 --> 01:06:06.192
Well, he treated me
like shit, so...


1004
01:06:08.455 --> 01:06:11.066
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

1005
01:06:16.071 --> 01:06:18.421
Yeah. We need somethin'
better than this.


1006
01:06:19.422 --> 01:06:20.684
You deserve better.

1007
01:06:20.771 --> 01:06:22.556
We deserve better.

1008
01:06:25.515 --> 01:06:27.256
I might have an opportunity.

1009
01:06:28.562 --> 01:06:31.086
Just thinkin' of goin'
to Austin, Texas.


1010
01:06:31.173 --> 01:06:33.654
Yeah? Austin.

1011
01:06:33.741 --> 01:06:36.047
I have a friend
who lives out there.
She loves it.


1012
01:06:38.311 --> 01:06:40.008
Well, what-what do you think?

1013
01:06:41.096 --> 01:06:42.793
Are you asking me to go?

1014
01:06:45.013 --> 01:06:47.581
- Yeah.
- When?


1015
01:06:47.668 --> 01:06:50.410
Uh, s-soon, like a few days.

1016
01:06:50.497 --> 01:06:52.629
That's very soon.

1017
01:06:52.716 --> 01:06:53.978
Where are you staying?

1018
01:06:54.762 --> 01:06:56.633
Don't know yet.
You wanna come?


1019
01:06:57.808 --> 01:06:59.070
Fuck, yeah.

1020
01:06:59.158 --> 01:07:01.595
- Yeah? For real?
- Yeah, for real.


1021
01:07:01.682 --> 01:07:03.901
Don't-don't-don't--
Don't play with me, you know?


1022
01:07:03.988 --> 01:07:08.167
What's keeping me here?
I've been dyin' to go somewhere,
like fuckin' anywhere.


1023
01:07:08.254 --> 01:07:11.518
Yeah, we can-- You know,
we can start from scratch there,


1024
01:07:11.605 --> 01:07:13.781
be whoever we wanna be.

1025
01:07:13.868 --> 01:07:16.087
I mean, fuck this place, right?

1026
01:07:16.175 --> 01:07:18.612
- What's this?
- This is for good luck.


1027
01:08:24.547 --> 01:08:26.027
Here we go.

1028
01:08:26.114 --> 01:08:27.594
Vodka rocks, handsome.

1029
01:08:31.511 --> 01:08:33.034
Where's your boyfriend?

1030
01:08:33.121 --> 01:08:35.471
Oh, you're thinking
of someone else.


1031
01:08:35.558 --> 01:08:37.038
No, the guy last night.

1032
01:08:37.734 --> 01:08:39.214
You jealous?

1033
01:08:41.651 --> 01:08:43.262
I'm not the jealous type.

1034
01:08:44.306 --> 01:08:46.047
Yeah, right.

1035
01:08:46.134 --> 01:08:48.484
Enjoy your drink.

1036
01:09:17.121 --> 01:09:21.125
Ah! You come back already.

1037
01:09:21.212 --> 01:09:23.911
I told you. I told you.

1038
01:09:24.955 --> 01:09:27.175
So, uh, can I come in or what?

1039
01:09:27.262 --> 01:09:30.657
Hmm. Come in. Come on.

1040
01:09:39.796 --> 01:09:42.321
Take a seat.

1041
01:09:43.670 --> 01:09:47.848
So, what's your business?

1042
01:09:47.935 --> 01:09:51.373
I'm, uh, here for that deal
you were tellin' me about.


1043
01:09:53.897 --> 01:09:56.247
The-- the H?

1044
01:09:57.292 --> 01:09:58.511
Hmm.

1045
01:10:00.339 --> 01:10:01.905
This ain't for Leff?

1046
01:10:03.254 --> 01:10:04.255
No.

1047
01:10:05.256 --> 01:10:06.736
But we're cool, right?

1048
01:10:10.784 --> 01:10:13.830
Yeah, yeah, we cool, my friend.

1049
01:10:14.831 --> 01:10:15.832
Hmm.

1050
01:10:16.833 --> 01:10:21.534
So, we keep this
between you and me, then.


1051
01:10:21.621 --> 01:10:23.187
This not a Leff thing.

1052
01:10:23.274 --> 01:10:25.755
Right. Right,
it's not a Leff thing.


1053
01:10:26.626 --> 01:10:28.845
He gets nervous
about shit like this.


1054
01:10:28.932 --> 01:10:31.718
Hmm. I understand.

1055
01:10:35.156 --> 01:10:36.157
So...

1056
01:10:39.769 --> 01:10:40.814
So, um...

1057
01:10:43.207 --> 01:10:44.600
What-what's the deal?

1058
01:10:47.211 --> 01:10:48.387
For you...

1059
01:10:58.005 --> 01:10:59.223
...30k.

1060
01:10:59.789 --> 01:11:01.095
Great.

1061
01:11:01.182 --> 01:11:02.792
You have the money with you?

1062
01:11:02.879 --> 01:11:04.794
No, but it's not a problem.

1063
01:11:06.143 --> 01:11:08.842
Hmm. Wait here a minute.

1064
01:11:32.343 --> 01:11:35.129
Go, go, go.
Go back in your room.
Go in your room.


1065
01:11:35.956 --> 01:11:37.348
You're all set.

1066
01:11:38.306 --> 01:11:39.438
It's all good.

1067
01:11:40.569 --> 01:11:41.962
Here's what you do.

1068
01:11:42.049 --> 01:11:45.182
You gonna meet this man,
eleven o'clock,


1069
01:11:45.269 --> 01:11:46.880
tomorrow night.

1070
01:11:46.967 --> 01:11:49.230
He'll have what you need.

1071
01:11:49.317 --> 01:11:51.798
- That's it?
- That's it.


1072
01:11:54.148 --> 01:11:56.977
You see? Everybody happy.

1073
01:12:01.068 --> 01:12:03.723
Wanna walk me home?
I'm not far.


1074
01:12:04.724 --> 01:12:05.681
Sure.

1075
01:12:06.508 --> 01:12:07.553
I can do that.

1076
01:12:18.302 --> 01:12:20.000
- I can't do this.
- Sure, you can.


1077
01:12:20.087 --> 01:12:22.219
No. No, no.

1078
01:12:22.306 --> 01:12:23.960
I can't.

1079
01:12:24.047 --> 01:12:25.832
I got a kid.

1080
01:12:25.919 --> 01:12:28.574
And, uh, I'm tryin'
to work things out with my ex.


1081
01:12:28.661 --> 01:12:30.097
Seriously?

1082
01:12:31.577 --> 01:12:32.534
Yeah.

1083
01:12:35.015 --> 01:12:36.277
Oh, whatever.

1084
01:12:40.934 --> 01:12:42.805
I can still walk you home,
though?


1085
01:12:42.892 --> 01:12:44.372
What for?

1086
01:12:46.243 --> 01:12:47.331
Night, sweetie.

1087
01:13:12.008 --> 01:13:14.707
Oh, it-it's cool. Just tell him
I'm-I'm Leff's nephew.


1088
01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:26.501
Yep.

1089
01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:38.078
I got a proposition for you.

1090
01:13:39.775 --> 01:13:43.431
Proposition? Shit.
I talk to Leff direct.


1091
01:13:43.518 --> 01:13:45.346
Uh, this ain't Leff's deal.

1092
01:13:45.433 --> 01:13:48.479
- Then whose deal is it?
- It's mine.


1093
01:13:48.567 --> 01:13:52.527
I got a kilo of pure,
clean, white H.


1094
01:13:52.614 --> 01:13:54.094
It's a steal.

1095
01:13:54.181 --> 01:13:55.878
If it's such a steal,
how come Leff ain't buyin'?


1096
01:13:57.576 --> 01:14:00.143
My mother, uh, Leff's sister

1097
01:14:00.230 --> 01:14:02.363
she fucked up
and OD'd on the shit.


1098
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:03.886
Leff won't go near it.

1099
01:14:05.453 --> 01:14:07.455
Take me to your man.
I'll deal directly.


1100
01:14:07.542 --> 01:14:09.283
Oh, you know, I can't do that.

1101
01:14:10.632 --> 01:14:13.243
Come on.
You'll make at least a 100K.


1102
01:14:13.330 --> 01:14:15.768
It's pure.
You can cut it up like crazy.


1103
01:14:17.073 --> 01:14:18.161
How much?

1104
01:14:19.119 --> 01:14:20.207
It's, um...

1105
01:14:21.208 --> 01:14:22.296
It's 40K.

1106
01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:25.952
You gettin' played.

1107
01:14:27.214 --> 01:14:28.955
No, it's for real.

1108
01:14:31.522 --> 01:14:34.743
Alright. Bring it to me
and I'll hit you with the cash.


1109
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:37.006
No, I-I need
the money up front.


1110
01:14:37.093 --> 01:14:38.878
I don't have it
to just lay out like that.


1111
01:14:40.619 --> 01:14:42.359
So, you ain't here
makin' a deal,


1112
01:14:42.446 --> 01:14:44.405
you lookin' for a loan.

1113
01:14:46.059 --> 01:14:48.322
- Come on, man, you know me.
- I know shit.


1114
01:14:49.410 --> 01:14:53.153
You want a loan,
then it's the same
as everybody else.


1115
01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:55.590
This ain't Red fuckin' Cross,
motherfucker.


1116
01:14:55.677 --> 01:14:58.114
Alright. Alright.

1117
01:14:58.201 --> 01:15:01.727
Then give me a loan.
And, uh, I'll come back
tomorrow night to settle up.


1118
01:15:02.553 --> 01:15:04.468
What you puttin' up
for collateral?


1119
01:15:05.818 --> 01:15:07.515
I got Leff's car
right out front.


1120
01:15:26.403 --> 01:15:28.667
Ma, how you feelin'?

1121
01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.626
I know, it's okay.

1122
01:15:33.323 --> 01:15:34.629
I saw him.

1123
01:15:36.718 --> 01:15:37.980
You saw who, Ma?

1124
01:15:39.068 --> 01:15:42.855
He has the nerve
to show his face. That animal.


1125
01:15:42.942 --> 01:15:44.813
Ma, you're in the hospital.
You're just dreamin'.


1126
01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:46.206
I'm telling you.

1127
01:15:46.859 --> 01:15:49.992
I saw him in the street
before I came here.


1128
01:15:50.993 --> 01:15:55.606
He-- he killed my baby,
now he's killing me.


1129
01:15:55.694 --> 01:15:58.522
You don't have to--
Don't get yourself upset, okay?


1130
01:15:58.609 --> 01:15:59.698
It's gonna be okay.

1131
01:16:12.798 --> 01:16:14.147
You're lost, asshole.

1132
01:16:15.278 --> 01:16:16.540
I got an offer for you.

1133
01:16:16.627 --> 01:16:17.933
Yeah, not interested.

1134
01:16:18.586 --> 01:16:20.240
- Who the hell
is this guy?
- Nobody.


1135
01:16:20.327 --> 01:16:21.807
Alright? Just ignore him.

1136
01:16:21.894 --> 01:16:24.723
Meet with me
and I'll pay you for your time.


1137
01:16:28.683 --> 01:16:30.380
Are you fuckin' serious?

1138
01:16:30.467 --> 01:16:32.600
- Bribing me now?
- Yeah, I'm serious.


1139
01:16:32.687 --> 01:16:35.211
Fuckin' pathetic.

1140
01:16:35.298 --> 01:16:37.518
- You good, bro?
- I'm fine.


1141
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.089
- How much?
- Fifty.


1142
01:16:44.525 --> 01:16:46.396
Did he say 50?
Then I'll take it.


1143
01:16:46.483 --> 01:16:48.007
No, you're not gonna take it.

1144
01:16:48.094 --> 01:16:50.052
I'll pay you.
It's the easiest money
you'll ever make.


1145
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:53.926
Nah, not worth it.

1146
01:16:54.013 --> 01:16:55.492
- It ain't shit.
- Alright.


1147
01:16:56.972 --> 01:17:02.543
Well, think about it.
Change your mind,
meet me at the courts at 4:00.


1148
01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:04.327
- You know that guy?
- No.


1149
01:17:04.414 --> 01:17:05.764
He's a little weirdo.

1150
01:17:16.731 --> 01:17:17.732
Nice.

1151
01:17:19.125 --> 01:17:20.691
Again.

1152
01:17:20.779 --> 01:17:22.824
I saw him.

1153
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:27.263
Good. Chop. Again.

1154
01:17:28.134 --> 01:17:31.441
- She's seeing
someone else.
- She told you that?


1155
01:17:32.878 --> 01:17:34.793
Why didn't you call
and tell me
you were comin' early?


1156
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:37.056
Good.

1157
01:17:37.143 --> 01:17:38.448
You stay there.

1158
01:17:38.535 --> 01:17:40.059
Maybe you're just havin'
a moment of weakness.


1159
01:17:40.146 --> 01:17:41.756
Get the fuck outta here.

1160
01:17:43.018 --> 01:17:44.106
No, I know.

1161
01:17:46.239 --> 01:17:47.849
I saw him.

1162
01:17:48.807 --> 01:17:50.156
I saw him.

1163
01:17:52.419 --> 01:17:54.073
- Hey!
- What the fuck?


1164
01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.509
Hey!

1165
01:17:55.596 --> 01:17:57.119
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, dude!


1166
01:17:57.206 --> 01:17:58.468
- Fuck off!
- What the fuck, man?


1167
01:17:58.555 --> 01:17:59.861
- Fuck off me!
- Look at me!


1168
01:17:59.948 --> 01:18:01.428
- You lost your fuckin' mind?
- Fuck you!


1169
01:18:01.515 --> 01:18:04.039
Get off me! Get your shit,
get the fuck out of here!


1170
01:18:04.126 --> 01:18:06.085
- You're fired!
- Back off, man!


1171
01:18:14.702 --> 01:18:16.530
You got the wrong idea about me.

1172
01:18:16.617 --> 01:18:19.272
- You think that I'm--
- You don't know what I think.


1173
01:18:20.708 --> 01:18:21.970
Then tell me.

1174
01:18:42.382 --> 01:18:44.297
So, you really wanna do this?

1175
01:18:45.385 --> 01:18:46.473
Yeah.

1176
01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.692
I mean, really?

1177
01:18:48.779 --> 01:18:50.825
How is this supposed
to play out?


1178
01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:54.916
I never stopped thinkin'
about you and Jimmy.


1179
01:18:56.744 --> 01:18:58.702
- Kept me goin'.
- You're not even thinking


1180
01:18:58.789 --> 01:19:00.313
about what you're doin' to me.

1181
01:19:01.183 --> 01:19:03.359
You've always
been irresponsible.


1182
01:19:06.885 --> 01:19:09.148
- Why do you hate me so much?
- I don't hate you.


1183
01:19:09.931 --> 01:19:11.411
I hate what you did.

1184
01:19:11.498 --> 01:19:14.370
To me, our son, that boy.

1185
01:19:16.546 --> 01:19:18.374
You should never
have come back here.


1186
01:19:19.245 --> 01:19:20.637
I had to see you.

1187
01:19:24.337 --> 01:19:25.816
I needed to see him.

1188
01:19:25.904 --> 01:19:28.341
And what about
what he needs, hmm?


1189
01:19:28.428 --> 01:19:31.953
I can still do
something good, Donna.


1190
01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.434
I know who I am,
I know who I can be.


1191
01:19:35.217 --> 01:19:38.917
And I know we can still be
a family together.


1192
01:19:39.526 --> 01:19:42.703
So now, you figured it all out
and now we should all fall
at your feet.


1193
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:45.314
Well, I guess the whole world
can start spinning again.


1194
01:19:46.925 --> 01:19:48.927
You ever think how--
how I felt?


1195
01:19:49.014 --> 01:19:52.147
- Oh, please. How you felt?
- Yeah.


1196
01:19:52.234 --> 01:19:53.757
- Huh.
- I mean, you never once


1197
01:19:53.844 --> 01:19:55.542
came to see me in there.

1198
01:19:55.629 --> 01:19:56.891
All that time,

1199
01:19:57.805 --> 01:19:59.067
and I never saw you.

1200
01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:02.636
- I never saw Jimmy.
- We all did the time!


1201
01:20:02.723 --> 01:20:06.031
Do you have any idea
how hard things have been?


1202
01:20:06.118 --> 01:20:07.380
Fuck.

1203
01:20:08.598 --> 01:20:10.992
You know, at first...

1204
01:20:11.079 --> 01:20:13.603
at first, I really missed you.

1205
01:20:13.690 --> 01:20:16.302
I even thought
I'd come and see you.


1206
01:20:16.389 --> 01:20:21.046
But every day became longer,
and harder,
and I stopped missing you.


1207
01:20:21.133 --> 01:20:25.093
You left me alone
with our son and now
he is my son, not yours!


1208
01:20:26.965 --> 01:20:29.402
Do you have any remorse
for all that you've done?


1209
01:20:29.489 --> 01:20:34.102
To me, to us,
to that kid's family?


1210
01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:36.409
I live with that remorse
every day.


1211
01:20:36.496 --> 01:20:37.932
Oh, yeah.

1212
01:20:41.327 --> 01:20:42.502
Jesus, Donna.

1213
01:20:43.807 --> 01:20:45.461
What do you want me to say?

1214
01:20:46.506 --> 01:20:49.291
I just want you to go, okay?

1215
01:20:52.991 --> 01:20:54.949
I never stopped loving you.

1216
01:21:05.177 --> 01:21:07.570
It's not too late.

1217
01:21:11.183 --> 01:21:12.445
It is too late.

1218
01:21:19.191 --> 01:21:21.236
Please leave.
I have to go to work.


1219
01:21:44.738 --> 01:21:45.826
This is my number.

1220
01:21:47.262 --> 01:21:50.091
Think about it.
Maybe you'll change your mind.


1221
01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:56.793
Fuck you.

1222
01:22:49.019 --> 01:22:50.108
Thanks for comin'.

1223
01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.285
You got my money?

1224
01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:03.425
Alright, what now?

1225
01:23:04.992 --> 01:23:06.080
Just talk.

1226
01:23:07.081 --> 01:23:09.605
Okay. Why'd you leave my mom?

1227
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.262
Right to the point.

1228
01:23:18.136 --> 01:23:20.138
I never meant
to leave you or your mom.


1229
01:23:23.053 --> 01:23:26.144
- But you did.
- Yeah, I fucked up.


1230
01:23:27.841 --> 01:23:29.016
I fucked up bad.

1231
01:23:32.976 --> 01:23:34.326
I did some time.

1232
01:23:39.418 --> 01:23:40.506
What for?

1233
01:23:42.769 --> 01:23:44.205
I was about your age.

1234
01:23:45.989 --> 01:23:48.122
Me and my friend Steve,
we were hangin' out.


1235
01:23:49.819 --> 01:23:54.650
And, uh, Steve
started hittin' on some girl.


1236
01:23:55.999 --> 01:23:57.305
Next thing we know,

1237
01:23:58.654 --> 01:24:01.309
her boyfriend and his friends
were kickin' our asses.


1238
01:24:04.356 --> 01:24:07.750
I was okay.
But those guys, they--


1239
01:24:07.837 --> 01:24:10.362
They beat up Steve pretty bad.

1240
01:24:12.712 --> 01:24:15.367
Next day, I took my father's gun

1241
01:24:16.542 --> 01:24:18.544
and I went to this kid's block.

1242
01:24:20.067 --> 01:24:23.288
I just wanted to put
some fear into him
after what he did, but...


1243
01:24:28.858 --> 01:24:30.338
he just came at me.

1244
01:24:35.125 --> 01:24:36.126
Fuck.

1245
01:24:38.607 --> 01:24:41.958
He just came at me and I-I was,
uh, I was so shocked!


1246
01:24:42.045 --> 01:24:43.786
I had-
- I had a gun.

1247
01:24:44.657 --> 01:24:46.224
And he just came at me.

1248
01:24:48.530 --> 01:24:49.879
So, it was an accident?

1249
01:24:55.276 --> 01:24:56.234
No.

1250
01:24:58.975 --> 01:25:00.238
At that moment,

1251
01:25:01.369 --> 01:25:02.675
God, I just...

1252
01:25:04.851 --> 01:25:06.505
I wanted to kill him.

1253
01:25:11.945 --> 01:25:13.033
Listen, uh...

1254
01:25:15.165 --> 01:25:17.603
Listen, I-I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you.


1255
01:25:19.692 --> 01:25:22.085
I've hated myself every day

1256
01:25:22.172 --> 01:25:24.871
for the last 16 years
because I wasn't there.


1257
01:25:29.528 --> 01:25:32.748
And just knowin'
that you were out there and...


1258
01:25:32.835 --> 01:25:36.056
and one day, one day,
hopefully one day


1259
01:25:36.143 --> 01:25:39.712
that I would get to see you
and meet you...


1260
01:25:41.714 --> 01:25:43.150
It got me through, man.

1261
01:25:45.065 --> 01:25:48.111
I... I don't think
I'd have survived without that.


1262
01:26:03.518 --> 01:26:04.911
You saved me, buddy.

1263
01:26:48.433 --> 01:26:50.696
You hungry? You want the usual?

1264
01:26:52.654 --> 01:26:54.090
Why didn't you tell me?

1265
01:26:54.177 --> 01:26:55.265
Tell you what?

1266
01:26:56.484 --> 01:26:57.746
The truth about him.

1267
01:26:59.357 --> 01:27:01.010
I told you everything.

1268
01:27:01.097 --> 01:27:02.403
No, actually,

1269
01:27:03.361 --> 01:27:04.884
he told me everything.

1270
01:27:14.546 --> 01:27:18.245
How could you lie
for that long?


1271
01:27:18.332 --> 01:27:20.595
- When were you gonna tell me?
- And what's the right age
to tell you,


1272
01:27:20.682 --> 01:27:23.990
"Oh, by the way, your father's
in jail"? Five, seven, three?


1273
01:27:24.077 --> 01:27:25.600
I had a right to know.

1274
01:27:26.427 --> 01:27:29.561
Like it or not, I did.
And I'm gonna see him again.


1275
01:27:29.648 --> 01:27:31.301
- Don't do that to me.
- It's not about you.


1276
01:27:31.389 --> 01:27:33.521
He comes back into our lives,
he's gonna tear us apart.


1277
01:27:33.608 --> 01:27:35.958
No. What's gonna tear us apart

1278
01:27:36.045 --> 01:27:37.830
is you trying
to control everything,


1279
01:27:37.917 --> 01:27:39.179
like you always do.

1280
01:27:41.050 --> 01:27:42.312
That's what makes it worse.

1281
01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.663
Jimmy, wait, please. Please.

1282
01:27:48.841 --> 01:27:49.842
Please.

1283
01:27:56.196 --> 01:27:59.852
Everything I do and did
is because I love you.
You know that, right?


1284
01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:04.422
Can you let me talk to him first
before you see him again?


1285
01:28:05.727 --> 01:28:07.207
Can you do that for me?

1286
01:28:10.428 --> 01:28:11.777
Will your friend let us
stay with her?


1287
01:28:11.864 --> 01:28:13.648
I didn't ask her yet.
I don't wanna jinx it.


1288
01:28:13.735 --> 01:28:15.911
Well, call her.
It's as good as done.


1289
01:28:15.998 --> 01:28:16.999
Alright.

1290
01:28:18.392 --> 01:28:20.263
I'll see you later.

1291
01:28:29.751 --> 01:28:30.970
What the fuck, man?

1292
01:28:31.057 --> 01:28:32.450
Jesus Christ.

1293
01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:39.587
Eli, come on. Come on.

1294
01:28:39.674 --> 01:28:41.502
It's-it's-it's not
what you think.


1295
01:28:42.372 --> 01:28:44.244
I-I-I thought
you didn't want her.


1296
01:28:44.331 --> 01:28:46.028
She thought you didn't want her.

1297
01:28:48.335 --> 01:28:50.206
I'm sorry. I really am.

1298
01:28:51.033 --> 01:28:52.121
I sh--

1299
01:28:53.471 --> 01:28:54.994
I shouldn't have done that.

1300
01:28:55.081 --> 01:28:57.083
It's fuckin' stupid.
I know I shouldn't
have done that.


1301
01:28:57.953 --> 01:28:59.389
Please don't kill me.

1302
01:28:59.477 --> 01:29:01.000
Oh, fuck.

1303
01:29:05.004 --> 01:29:07.963
You go near her again,
I fuckin' kill you.


1304
01:29:21.716 --> 01:29:24.197
- Taps are out again.
- Great.


1305
01:29:31.291 --> 01:29:33.685
Hey. Hey, uh,
can you hold a sec?


1306
01:29:33.772 --> 01:29:35.469
Uh, let me get somewhere quiet.

1307
01:29:38.472 --> 01:29:40.082
Hey, I'm here.

1308
01:29:40.169 --> 01:29:42.345
Look, I know you're
gonna continue to see my son


1309
01:29:42.432 --> 01:29:43.825
regardless of what I say.

1310
01:29:43.912 --> 01:29:45.348
It's not like that.

1311
01:29:45.435 --> 01:29:47.350
Please let me finish.

1312
01:29:47.437 --> 01:29:49.309
Of course. Sorry.

1313
01:29:49.396 --> 01:29:52.355
If you are gonna have
any interaction with him,


1314
01:29:52.442 --> 01:29:54.401
it has to be by my rules.

1315
01:29:54.488 --> 01:29:56.664
I wanna know everything,
every step of the way.


1316
01:29:56.751 --> 01:29:58.187
Absolutely. Understood.

1317
01:30:00.755 --> 01:30:02.801
Did you mean those things
you said to me?


1318
01:30:03.453 --> 01:30:06.152
- Every word.
- Then,


1319
01:30:06.239 --> 01:30:08.371
will you promise me
you'll do what I'm asking?


1320
01:30:09.459 --> 01:30:12.332
Yeah. Absolutely, I swear.

1321
01:30:13.551 --> 01:30:15.248
I will tell you everything.

1322
01:30:15.944 --> 01:30:16.945
Alright.

1323
01:30:18.338 --> 01:30:19.557
Alright.

1324
01:30:19.644 --> 01:30:21.515
I gotta get back to work.

1325
01:30:21.602 --> 01:30:22.951
We'll talk.

1326
01:30:23.038 --> 01:30:24.126
Thank you, Donna.

1327
01:30:25.432 --> 01:30:26.433
Bye.

1328
01:30:34.746 --> 01:30:36.182
What's up?

1329
01:30:36.269 --> 01:30:38.271
I'm so sorry to spring this
on you last minute,


1330
01:30:38.358 --> 01:30:40.621
but, um,
I'm heading to Austin.


1331
01:30:40.708 --> 01:30:42.144
Okay. For how long?

1332
01:30:42.231 --> 01:30:44.625
I don't know.
Like, maybe a while.


1333
01:30:46.192 --> 01:30:48.542
- Okay.
- Look, I know this put you


1334
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:50.326
in a bad spot
with, like, rent and shit,


1335
01:30:50.413 --> 01:30:53.460
and I will totally
still help out,
like, as much as I can.


1336
01:30:53.547 --> 01:30:55.593
I'd appreciate that.

1337
01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.682
Wow! Like, this is crazy.

1338
01:30:57.769 --> 01:31:01.163
I mean, should I be
happy for you?


1339
01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:02.338
I think so.

1340
01:31:10.999 --> 01:31:13.219
- What's up?
- Ray?


1341
01:31:15.134 --> 01:31:16.439
You-you know Jamal?

1342
01:31:19.138 --> 01:31:21.009
You got my stuff?

1343
01:31:21.096 --> 01:31:22.881
Yup. Alright, let's have it.

1344
01:31:24.839 --> 01:31:26.058
Where's-where's my stuff?

1345
01:31:26.145 --> 01:31:27.625
Yo, money first.

1346
01:31:29.365 --> 01:31:31.193
No, no way.

1347
01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:32.891
Well, fuck off
and don't waste my time.


1348
01:31:32.978 --> 01:31:34.153
Well...

1349
01:31:35.154 --> 01:31:38.244
Oh, come on. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.


1350
01:31:40.289 --> 01:31:41.639
Look, you down or not?

1351
01:31:42.552 --> 01:31:44.598
Yeah. I mean,
how-how long is it gonna take?


1352
01:31:45.338 --> 01:31:46.426
I'll be right back.

1353
01:31:47.906 --> 01:31:48.820
Yeah.

1354
01:32:28.163 --> 01:32:29.687
What can
I get you, buddy?


1355
01:32:29.774 --> 01:32:30.992
Little Cream, please.

1356
01:32:34.561 --> 01:32:35.736
- Here we go.
- Cheers.


1357
01:32:38.173 --> 01:32:39.479
What can I get you, man?

1358
01:32:39.566 --> 01:32:40.698
I'll take a Bud.

1359
01:32:40.785 --> 01:32:42.308
Uh, we just got Little Cream.

1360
01:32:43.222 --> 01:32:44.484
- Is it good?
- Sure.


1361
01:32:57.802 --> 01:32:58.977
Oh!

1362
01:32:59.064 --> 01:33:01.153
- What the--
- Hey, hey!


1363
01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:03.721
- Alright.
- Jesus Christ.


1364
01:33:03.808 --> 01:33:05.200
This place is toast, man.

1365
01:33:09.248 --> 01:33:10.728
What the fuck, man?

1366
01:33:11.598 --> 01:33:13.382
Who is this?

1367
01:33:13.469 --> 01:33:15.689
Uh, hi, hi.
I'm-I'm sorry to bother you.


1368
01:33:15.776 --> 01:33:18.736
Do-- Uh, is Ray--
You know where-where Ray lives?


1369
01:33:18.823 --> 01:33:21.347
Open the fuckin' door!

1370
01:33:21.434 --> 01:33:23.436
Oh, man. Fuck!

1371
01:33:24.829 --> 01:33:26.221
Just open the door, please.

1372
01:33:26.308 --> 01:33:28.267
- I'm callin' the cops!
- Hey, hey, hey.


1373
01:33:28.354 --> 01:33:30.443
Please.

1374
01:33:30.530 --> 01:33:31.836
Fuckin' gonna kill you!

1375
01:33:36.318 --> 01:33:38.668
Fuck, man! Fuck!

1376
01:33:46.589 --> 01:33:49.027
Come on, come on. Come on.

1377
01:33:53.422 --> 01:33:54.772
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1378
01:33:54.859 --> 01:33:57.122
- What is this?
- Your fucking buddy set us up!


1379
01:33:57.209 --> 01:33:59.254
No. Can't be.

1380
01:33:59.341 --> 01:34:01.387
Well, he fuckin' did!

1381
01:34:01.474 --> 01:34:03.128
Christ.

1382
01:34:03.215 --> 01:34:04.912
What is with people these days?

1383
01:34:04.999 --> 01:34:07.132
Messin' up a clean deal.

1384
01:34:07.219 --> 01:34:10.048
No, no, no. You,
you've gotta fix this.


1385
01:34:10.135 --> 01:34:13.094
I wish I could help you,
my friend.


1386
01:34:13.181 --> 01:34:16.054
All I did was pass on the info.

1387
01:34:16.141 --> 01:34:18.839
This is a risk we all take
in this business.


1388
01:34:18.926 --> 01:34:20.885
No, no, no, no, no.

1389
01:34:21.886 --> 01:34:22.843
Stop!

1390
01:34:26.325 --> 01:34:27.630
You're upset.

1391
01:34:28.501 --> 01:34:29.850
I understand.

1392
01:34:31.069 --> 01:34:32.897
Let's leave it at that.

1393
01:34:34.072 --> 01:34:36.074
I won't hold it against you.

1394
01:34:36.770 --> 01:34:38.511
Okay, let's go.

1395
01:34:38.598 --> 01:34:41.166
Alright, okay.
Yeah, yep, yep.


1396
01:34:41.253 --> 01:34:43.777
Yep, yep.

1397
01:34:43.864 --> 01:34:45.692
I
-I had a little problem.

1398
01:34:46.693 --> 01:34:50.305
Um, here's ten grand back, okay?

1399
01:34:51.785 --> 01:34:53.308
I'm gonna need a little time.

1400
01:34:54.353 --> 01:34:56.268
All I need is a little time,
and I'll get--


1401
01:34:56.355 --> 01:34:57.747
I'll get the rest back to you.

1402
01:34:58.531 --> 01:34:59.749
You got it.

1403
01:35:02.796 --> 01:35:04.537
Oh, thanks, man. I'm--

1404
01:35:04.624 --> 01:35:06.539
I'll start payin' it off
right away.


1405
01:35:06.626 --> 01:35:09.324
Sure, take your time.

1406
01:35:09.411 --> 01:35:11.065
Oh, man, thank you.

1407
01:35:12.806 --> 01:35:14.503
You, um...

1408
01:35:15.504 --> 01:35:16.897
You th-- you think
I could get the car back?


1409
01:35:21.206 --> 01:35:23.425
Oh.

1410
01:35:31.999 --> 01:35:33.522
Bring that piece of shit out.

1411
01:35:33.609 --> 01:35:35.002
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1412
01:35:35.089 --> 01:35:37.396
Wait. Oh, shit.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.


1413
01:35:40.703 --> 01:35:42.923
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1414
01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:45.534
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Stop, stop, stop! Stop!


1415
01:35:45.621 --> 01:35:47.623
No, I can get the money.
I can get it.


1416
01:35:47.710 --> 01:35:49.538
I
-I'm serious. I can.

1417
01:35:50.235 --> 01:35:52.933
Alright. You got till morning.

1418
01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:55.153
Otherwise, I'll take
both your eyes.


1419
01:36:04.814 --> 01:36:06.860
She was so upset, man.

1420
01:36:07.643 --> 01:36:09.428
I just didn't think
she would call.


1421
01:36:09.515 --> 01:36:12.953
And then she called.
She called.


1422
01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:14.433
You know, that's really great.

1423
01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:16.565
She's gonna let me
see Jimmy, man.


1424
01:36:16.652 --> 01:36:19.742
I mean, I know
it's a small step,
but...


1425
01:36:19.829 --> 01:36:21.527
I can't tell you
how happy I am.


1426
01:36:21.614 --> 01:36:23.311
Well, I think it's gonna
work out for you.


1427
01:36:23.398 --> 01:36:27.750
I really do.
Just don't fuck it up.


1428
01:36:27.837 --> 01:36:29.927
Okay, you want another?
We're celebrating.


1429
01:36:32.930 --> 01:36:35.062
Ah, nah, I'm done.

1430
01:36:35.149 --> 01:36:37.630
- Sure?
- Next weekend, I'm all yours.


1431
01:36:37.717 --> 01:36:40.459
- Alright. See ya.
- See ya.


1432
01:36:51.165 --> 01:36:53.602
Fucking look.
Take a fucking look.


1433
01:36:55.778 --> 01:36:58.172
Uh, uh...

1434
01:37:01.088 --> 01:37:03.003
Um...

1435
01:37:08.704 --> 01:37:10.489
Uh, uh...

1436
01:37:17.583 --> 01:37:19.237
Hey, do you, uh...

1437
01:37:20.586 --> 01:37:22.283
Do you, uh...

1438
01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:23.676
Alright, come on.

1439
01:37:23.763 --> 01:37:24.982
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on!


1440
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:27.985
Come on. Yep, yes.

1441
01:37:28.072 --> 01:37:29.595
That's it. That's it. Thanks.

1442
01:37:31.031 --> 01:37:32.990
Fuck. Fuck.

1443
01:37:38.125 --> 01:37:40.171
Yo, finish up, man.
I gotta close.


1444
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:48.179
Whoa.

1445
01:37:48.266 --> 01:37:49.876
Dude, the-the register's open.

1446
01:37:49.963 --> 01:37:51.660
Just-just take
what you want, man.


1447
01:37:51.747 --> 01:37:53.706
You thought you can get
away with it, huh?


1448
01:37:54.881 --> 01:37:56.013
Get away with what?

1449
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:57.797
Don't fuck with me.

1450
01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:00.017
I don't know what
you're talkin' about, man.


1451
01:38:00.104 --> 01:38:01.627
The fuck you don't?

1452
01:38:02.628 --> 01:38:04.108
You don't remember me, huh?

1453
01:38:04.195 --> 01:38:06.284
You got me mistaken, dude.

1454
01:38:06.371 --> 01:38:10.027
Like I'm gonna forget
the asshole who killed
my fuckin' brother? Huh?


1455
01:38:16.033 --> 01:38:18.557
- I was a kid, man.
- No, I was!


1456
01:38:21.429 --> 01:38:22.474
Come on, man.

1457
01:38:23.649 --> 01:38:25.999
- You don't wanna do this.
- Now you know what I want?


1458
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:29.307
Empty the fuckin' register.

1459
01:38:29.394 --> 01:38:31.091
You fuckin' followed me?

1460
01:38:31.178 --> 01:38:33.441
- What the fuck?
- Oh, you piece of shit!


1461
01:39:02.383 --> 01:39:03.645
No, man.

1462
01:39:06.735 --> 01:39:08.824
I'll make a deal with you, okay?

1463
01:39:09.956 --> 01:39:12.001
I'll tell 'em you saved my life.

1464
01:39:12.089 --> 01:39:13.786
And you stopped him
from robbin' the bar.


1465
01:39:19.226 --> 01:39:20.880
I'm givin' you a way out, man.

1466
01:39:20.967 --> 01:39:22.925
You'll be a hero.

1467
01:39:28.105 --> 01:39:30.107
I can't change what I did.

1468
01:39:30.194 --> 01:39:31.847
And I can't bring
your brother back.


1469
01:39:33.197 --> 01:39:36.025
But I can help you,
brother. Please.


1470
01:39:36.722 --> 01:39:37.723
Please.

1471
01:39:40.247 --> 01:39:42.206
Just let me help you, man.

1472
01:39:42.293 --> 01:39:43.729
It's okay.

1473
01:39:47.298 --> 01:39:48.995
Please, man.
Put the gun down.


1474
01:39:50.083 --> 01:39:51.128
It's okay.

1475
01:39:52.564 --> 01:39:53.695
Let me help you.

1476
01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:02.835
Thank you. Give me your hand.

1477
01:40:42.831 --> 01:40:45.747
A crippling transit strike
was avoided yesterday


1478
01:40:45.834 --> 01:40:47.706
when union leaders
awaiting new contract


1479
01:40:47.793 --> 01:40:51.884
voted to send
their 33,000 members
back to work.


1480
01:40:51.971 --> 01:40:54.278
Tragedy in Red Hook.

1481
01:40:54.365 --> 01:40:56.367
Bartender Adam DeSalvo, 38,

1482
01:40:56.454 --> 01:40:58.195
apparently shot
and killed a man


1483
01:40:58.282 --> 01:41:00.371
who was attempting
to hold up the bar.


1484
01:41:00.458 --> 01:41:03.417
DeSalvo was also shot
and killed.


1485
01:41:03.504 --> 01:41:06.377
The gunman, whose name
has not been released
by officials,


1486
01:41:06.464 --> 01:41:10.119
had apparently committed
a string of robberies
earlier last night.


1487
01:41:10.207 --> 01:41:13.819
The bar's owner, Lenny Colin,
found the bodies this morning.


1488
01:41:13.906 --> 01:41:16.300
Uh, he was a nice, quiet guy.

1489
01:41:16.387 --> 01:41:18.737
Should have just let him
take the money.


1490
01:41:18.824 --> 01:41:21.305
Ironically, DeSalvo
recently finished parole


1491
01:41:21.392 --> 01:41:23.481
and served 13 years
for manslaughter.


1492
01:41:23.568 --> 01:41:27.224
This caps over 20 shootings
this week alone.


1493
01:41:27.311 --> 01:41:29.661
The mayor is calling
for stronger gun control.


1494
01:41:29.748 --> 01:41:33.142
He is calling for calm
and understanding.


1495
01:41:33.230 --> 01:41:34.796
He said and I quote,

1496
01:41:34.883 --> 01:41:37.016
"When something
as powerful as a gun


1497
01:41:37.103 --> 01:41:40.280
finds its way in the hands
of the powerless,


1498
01:41:40.367 --> 01:41:42.630
violence is inevitable."
