00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:06.100
I see it, I see it. We stand by
just in case we have to revive her.


3
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.940
What was that?

4
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.360
Are you okay?

5
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.820
Okay?

6
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.520
How about this?

7
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.860
Hey!

8
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
What was that?

9
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.120
What was that?

10
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.920
What was that?

11
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.060
What was that?

12
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:39.360
What was that?

13
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.540
Hey!

14
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.650
Alright.

15
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.070
I'll see you then.

16
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.780
How are you holding out Dr. E?

17
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.820
Good job.
Tonight's been one of those nights.


18
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.020
You okay?

19
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.383
I'm bomb, but I look
like this sis, but you


20
00:03:37.395 --> 00:03:39.380
can your ass never need
to go with the doctor?


21
00:03:40.535 --> 00:03:43.920
Yeah, it's been hard to fill his shoes.
I don't know how that man does it.


22
00:03:44.855 --> 00:03:47.886
Ever since he retired, they
haven't been able to find a reliable


23
00:03:47.898 --> 00:03:50.560
surgeon to ease the load,
so I gotta do what I gotta do.


24
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:53.620
I mean, I understand that, but
at the cost of your own health.


25
00:03:55.395 --> 00:03:57.276
Well, that's correct.
I'm the one with the PhD.


26
00:03:58.715 --> 00:04:03.960
Well, excuse me. I mean, I understand that,
but like Beyonce said, I'm cool in life.


27
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.150
Hello?

28
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.690
So, are you ever going
to go in your bag?

29
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.630
Oh, you know that I'm
understaffed and overbooked.


30
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.926
I can give some shits
about what the board says.


31
00:04:28.938 --> 00:04:31.390
You're the only surgeon
holding that yard together.


32
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.630
And where are they going
to get you some damn help?


33
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.910
Hey, it's not that simple.

34
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.970
Well, they need to hurry up because
we're not missing this year's friendship.


35
00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:46.570
Oh, shit.

36
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.270
What?

37
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.370
I forgot about the trip.
I didn't put the time off.


38
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.230
James, look his sleeve. 
I know you're not.

39
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.801
Do you want to
back out of this trip?

40
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.026
We've missed the last two
years in a row because of you.


41
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.290
Oh, and I know, and I'm sorry, but
I don't know if I can get the time off.


42
00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:14.250
Oh, no, no, no, no.

43
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.530
We have not missed this trip.
Things between us are not right.


44
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.990
But don't be saying we should
take this time to heal our relationship.


45
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.010
James, I'm going on this
trip with or without you.


46
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.720
I'm worth money for you.

47
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.810
I love you too.

48
00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:45.811
What?

49
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.590
Was that your hubby?

50
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.070
Yeah.

51
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.486
He's not too happy with you right now.

52
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.210
Shit, I'd be sick of your ass too.

53
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:05.890
Why?

54
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.297
Because he said I'm here
worried about all these six


55
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:10.651
folks that are worried about
giving me a massive accident.


56
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.411
Or however y'all get down in the bedroom.

57
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.550
You need balance, Dr. Reed.
Right now, I don't care about his work.


58
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.830
Oh, so you're a relationship
therapist now too?


59
00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.410
And I am.

60
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.890
Shit.

61
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.730
Oh, Reed.

62
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.330
Dr. Johnson, aren't you
supposed to be on vacation?


63
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.911
Can I see your
mom just for a minute?

64
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.610
Thanks.

65
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.630
Oh, I see.

66
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.680
I see you're selling in well.

67
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.840
Well, I wouldn't say that.

68
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:54.841
Oh.

69
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.720
I understand.

70
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.600
So, how are you doing?

71
00:07:01.415 --> 00:07:02.620
Reed, how are you doing?

72
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.081
I'm not sure what you mean.

73
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:09.890
All right.

74
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.270
What's the most important
rule of the search?


75
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.790
Verify everything and do not rely
on the information provided by others.


76
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.110
Correct.

77
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.350
Rule number three.

78
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.251
They'll make promises you can't keep.

79
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.530
Yeah, exactly.

80
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.770
Then why are you not keeping
your promises in your marriage?


81
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.370
Eric, let's not pretend I'm
the only one not doing my part.


82
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.670
No one is not saying that, Reed.

83
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.750
I mean, just that your level
of commitment is concerning.


84
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.470
How?

85
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.570
Why am I being subjected to
ridicule when I've been giving it my all?


86
00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:52.930
And that's the thing, Reed.

87
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.161
It's nothing left for you.

88
00:07:56.835 --> 00:08:01.310
How do you be a great surgeon
when you don't hold up rule number 30?


89
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.270
Look, I'm only saying this because
I want to make things better for you.


90
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.070
I mean, you already have so many
odds and challenges against you.


91
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.090
I mean, you don't need to add anything else
to make things even harder for yourself.


92
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.950
You and Owen are wonderful in the visuals.

93
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:37.330
But it is so unfair and unfortunate that
the whole world views you as bad people.


94
00:08:38.015 --> 00:08:42.130
Even though they don't have a clue of who
you are or know any damn thing about you.


95
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:43.470
But you know what's there?

96
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:44.210
I do.

97
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:45.770
I do.

98
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:47.670
I understand you.

99
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.910
But me just knowing you isn't
enough to improve your situation.


100
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.080
I care about you, Scott.

101
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.790
And I care about your well-being.

102
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:06.579
And because I care, I just
want you to make choices


103
00:09:06.591 --> 00:09:11.090
that will benefit you
and Owen in the long run.


104
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.070
How's he fun?

105
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:24.490
That woman is kicking me into my toes.

106
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.830
Who is he that is spicy?

107
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.070
I love that she's a rock.

108
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.350
And Owen is yours.

109
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:41.370
Do you share?

110
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:43.830
All doctors to the ER.

111
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:49.550
Well, do we cause?

112
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:51.810
You're a shift.

113
00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:54.650
I'll try.

114
00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.710
And you try to do a retirement?

115
00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.850
I feel like I'm 30 again.

116
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.030
I told you I said, look out, baby.

117
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:04.590
Gross.

118
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:06.270
What's that saying?

119
00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:07.271
Freeze.

120
00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.530
Remember what I told you about.

121
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.060
Yeah.

122
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.580
Is this my handsome, the tired
husband that's been working today?


123
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.900
You are so funny.

124
00:11:08.515 --> 00:11:10.554
I was calling because I
wanted you to know that


125
00:11:10.566 --> 00:11:12.660
I was going to be
wrapping it up with the fella.


126
00:11:12.661 --> 00:11:13.040
Okay.

127
00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.460
Well, didn't be ready
when I really get home.


128
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.500
And I'll be ready too.

129
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.620
I like you now, man.

130
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.380
I love you.

131
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.880
I love you.

132
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.050
Hello?

133
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.940
Eric, is that you?

134
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.650
Jay, Jay is almost ready.

135
00:12:36.651 --> 00:12:37.790
Is she kind of lazy?

136
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:39.670
Almost, baby.

137
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.730
I'm just trying to narrow
it down to one spot.


138
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.340
What's wrong?

139
00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.180
I'm just fucking Julian again.

140
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.760
Hey, just making sure you remember
to send out that email we talked about.


141
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Can't wait to see y'all.

142
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.620
What's going on?

143
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:12.760
I don't know.

144
00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.840
He keeps texting and calling me
to send some email to everyone.


145
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.740
Email for what?

146
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:17.840
What?

147
00:13:18.655 --> 00:13:19.820
It's some production shit.

148
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.100
Hello, final.

149
00:13:21.305 --> 00:13:24.065
I told him that this weekend is
not even a right time to be doing it.


150
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.400
You owe me for her ass.

151
00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.740
No.

152
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.710
Because all you're going to do
is start cursing and hearing on.


153
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.780
And like I said, I want this
weekend to be good vibes, okay?


154
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:39.510
Hey, baby.

155
00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:40.050
Here.

156
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.330
What about this place?

157
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.630
A cabin.

158
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.030
And you know that we
don't like cabining cabbies.


159
00:13:47.305 --> 00:13:49.410
And that's what the problem we got is.

160
00:13:50.325 --> 00:13:53.610
Y'all need an experience of mine
and enjoy different experiences, okay?


161
00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:55.610
All right.

162
00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.510
Well, I know the girls are not going
to be feeling it, but we shall see.


163
00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:01.890
Whatever.

164
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:03.810
I'm booking it.

165
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:11.410
All right.

166
00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.070
I thought you were mad at me.

167
00:14:34.835 --> 00:14:36.195
You know I don't think math alone.

168
00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.450
And besides, I know that you're going to
do the right thing, so that you can't tell.


169
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.310
That relationship.

170
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:46.510
Baby, it's tough being in my position.

171
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:48.130
Where are you?

172
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.320
Don't give me that bullshit.

173
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.910
You look like I don't have the tough.

174
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.470
I'm that acting district attorney.

175
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:57.890
That lies on my hands, too.

176
00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.090
I didn't even mean it like that.

177
00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.930
Can we just enjoy this
dinner for the rest of the night?


178
00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:17.630
What's going on?

179
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:18.830
Hey, beaches.

180
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.030
You're ready for this trip?

181
00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:25.450
Hello?

182
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.270
We'll be there.

183
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.030
Yes!

184
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:30.130
That's it.

185
00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.390
That's it.

186
00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.150
They finally come in this year.

187
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.630
Hey, I'll see you.

188
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:36.730
We're going to get a lady.

189
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.610
Look at you being all cool and stuff.

190
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.030
Hmm.

191
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.510
Have you ever spoken
with Jackson and Charles?


192
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.930
Yeah, Jackson's a little tired.

193
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.250
You know, I'm going to see him
here in charge of booking supplies.


194
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:56.490
Charles, let me make sure my credit card
is paid up before they book some fuck shit.


195
00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:58.950
Julian, come on now.

196
00:15:58.951 --> 00:16:01.410
Let's not forget the cabin
you booked three years ago.


197
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.350
Bitch, that was the
last time we saw y'all.

198
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:05.630
And that's right.

199
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.950
Oh!

200
00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:07.330
Here she go.

201
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:08.370
Y'all play nice.

202
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:09.570
Let's go around.

203
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.150
That's cute.

204
00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:15.130
Anyway, make sure y'all
review Jackson's email.


205
00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.510
I will make sure you check it out.

206
00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.210
Well, all right, Charles.

207
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.270
I'm gonna let y'all go.

208
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.410
Enjoy your night.

209
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:23.650
Can't wait to see y'all.

210
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.110
Take care, see you soon.

211
00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:26.390
Bye!

212
00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.310
Hey, y'all two are always
at each other's legs.


213
00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:32.770
It's not me, it's him.

214
00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.672
Ever since college,
Julian's felt some kind of


215
00:16:35.684 --> 00:16:37.670
way that I got into medical
school and he didn't.


216
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:39.730
I can't help but that
I'm flat and educated.


217
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:40.690
Ooh.

218
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:42.210
Yeah.

219
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:43.770
It's not comfortable.

220
00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:44.650
Why?

221
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:45.936
I don't know what you've got.

222
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.680
I've never seen confidence over here, baby.

223
00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:56.970
Hey, baby.

224
00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:57.570
Sorry.

225
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:58.910
Sorry.

226
00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:00.630
I have to get
up in a few hours.

227
00:17:00.631 --> 00:17:01.850
I don't understand.

228
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
We're not going to eat.

229
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.400
Not hungry.

230
00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.330
Can you tell he's had a fourth bite?

231
00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:21.890
Ooh, baby.

232
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:23.910
I'm home.

233
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:27.910
Ooh, baby.

234
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.090
I've been missing you.

235
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.850
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

236
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:34.190
I got sorry.

237
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.750
I'm so late.

238
00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:36.010
I got caught up in the game.

239
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.140
The hell up in the game?

240
00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:41.330
Vegas versus Denver?

241
00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.410
I thought we had them
but they kicked our ass.


242
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:46.430
Oh, well.

243
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:51.230
Eva!

244
00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.290
Eva!

245
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.490
I'm trying to hide.

246
00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:58.150
Oh, baby.

247
00:17:58.151 --> 00:17:58.190
Sure.

248
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.730
Well, did that be a problem.

249
00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:02.450
Ha, ha.

250
00:18:02.735 --> 00:18:03.735
Who, Eva?

251
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:05.510
Don't ask.

252
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:07.330
Eva?

253
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:09.390
Eva?

254
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:11.390
Eva?

255
00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.320
Eva?

256
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:14.310
Eva?

257
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:15.630
Yes.

258
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.310
Hey, baby.

259
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.950
Hey, baby.

260
00:18:23.145 --> 00:18:23.970
Hey, baby.

261
00:18:23.971 --> 00:18:24.971
Hey, baby, baby.

262
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:25.350
Hey, baby.

263
00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.670
Oh, my God.

264
00:18:27.671 --> 00:18:28.750
I'm so funny!

265
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:30.710
People!

266
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.090
This is Victoria.

267
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.160
Yes, listen.

268
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.940
Everything is going to work itself out.

269
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.560
Exactly, between... Yes, with me
having the justice system on your side.


270
00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.920
Yes, you have nothing to worry about.

271
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.300
Mr.
Owens, I'm sorry to trouble you with this,


272
00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.760
but I just got to perform
with some local detectives,


273
00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.860
and I think you might
want to take a look at this.


274
00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.960
One second.

275
00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.100
Can't you wait?

276
00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:38.760
I'm sorry.

277
00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.100
Regina wouldn't bother
you if it wasn't important.


278
00:19:41.101 --> 00:19:42.101
Where are you?

279
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.240
Mr. Owens, I'll get your ring back.

280
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.580
Yes, after six, thank you. Okay, bye.

281
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.460
What is it?

282
00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.480
Dr. Eric Johnson and his
wife were found murdered.


283
00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.360
What?

284
00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.180
What?

285
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.660
This morning.

286
00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:14.550
Okay.

287
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:15.950
I'm going to go this way.

288
00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:17.610
I'm just not coming.

289
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.250
I can't.

290
00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:38.490
Oh, this is serious.

291
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:39.766
We got to get some stuff done.

292
00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:40.790
This is crazy up in here.

293
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:41.210
Yeah.

294
00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:42.010
Oh, shit.

295
00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.250
Let me call you back.

296
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:44.390
Hey! Hey!

297
00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:44.970
Mr. Why?

298
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:46.390
How's it going?

299
00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:47.370
Listen.

300
00:20:47.855 --> 00:20:49.655
I understand you're
friends with the victims.


301
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.450
Yes.

302
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:51.730
My husband's mentor.

303
00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:52.610
A good family friend.

304
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:53.110
Oh, wow.

305
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.470
Hey, listen, listen, listen.

306
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.446
I don't think you want to come in
here and see what the police found.


307
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.810
All right.

308
00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:58.970
It's not pretty.

309
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:03.580
I appreciate the caution.

310
00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:05.810
Do me a favor.

311
00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.970
A spammy is semantic.

312
00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.690
And allow me to do my job.

313
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.690
You know what?

314
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:12.270
You know what?

315
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.350
We found this picture.

316
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:14.410
This picture right here.

317
00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.040
It was led next to the bodies.

318
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:17.710
Let's just look at that.

319
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.170
Not sure what this is.

320
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:22.830
I'm looking for it.

321
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.570
Where are the bodies?

322
00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:24.190
Yeah.

323
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:24.490
Come on.

324
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.890
Follow me.

325
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.330
Come on.

326
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:26.770
Let's go.

327
00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:12.330
Let's go.

328
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:43.350
Go.

329
00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:37.640
Go.

330
00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:38.000
Dr. Reed.

331
00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:38.480
What's up?

332
00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.020
We all at?

333
00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.220
Still at home?

334
00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:42.940
What are you doing with me?

335
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.120
Why?

336
00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:44.121
Why?

337
00:23:45.665 --> 00:23:49.240
Apparently, I only had a last minute
situation he'd attend to before me.


338
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:50.380
Ciao!

339
00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.200
Thank God!

340
00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.440
We came all this
way just to see y'all!

341
00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.880
I know, I'm sorry I'm not
going to catch y'all in a few.


342
00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.520
Hurry the hell up!

343
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.200
We'll have some shots waiting for y'all!

344
00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:03.920
Can't wait to see you!

345
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.600
See y'all later!

346
00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:28.040
Police discovered famed surgeon Dr. Eric
Johnson and his wife brutally murdered.


347
00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:30.000
And their heads stitched together.

348
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.500
Police are still seeking answers
on these mystery murders.


349
00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:38.160
Stay tuned, Mordecom,
on K-T-A-A, Channel 5.


350
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.020
I am so sorry.

351
00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:04.360
What happened is it's a lot to explain.

352
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.800
Let's just talk about it in the car.

353
00:25:05.801 --> 00:25:07.020
In the car?

354
00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.820
What the fuck, Owen?

355
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.559
Tell me it was like
a father to me, I just


356
00:25:13.571 --> 00:25:15.940
can't get up and go
and not think about this.


357
00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:18.140
There's nothing we can do!

358
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:21.580
Situations are of our hands.

359
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.780
So now we have to allow
the authorities to handle this.


360
00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:35.780
I can't.

361
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.600
Listen.

362
00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.640
Listen.

363
00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.580
Listen.

364
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.200
My office is going to
get to the bottom of this.


365
00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:50.500
I've been working overtime to
catch the person who did this.


366
00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:58.440
And the last time you spoke
to Eric, he told you what.


367
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.360
I mean to experience life.

368
00:26:07.361 --> 00:26:08.361
I...

369
00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.260
Now that you have the opportunity.

370
00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:13.420
Let's go, babe!

371
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:22.850
What the hell was that?

372
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:25.030
Sorry, that was my stomach.

373
00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:28.030
You're right down there?

374
00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:31.870
I plan to let go this weekend
without my new Patience.


375
00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:37.770
I went across... I haven't eaten
because I'm waiting for my husband.


376
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:40.556
We used to have to get
snacks or something before


377
00:27:40.568 --> 00:27:42.646
we started drinking out
of the end of the crazy ass.


378
00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:43.950
So he got shots waiting for us.

379
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:46.790
Too long ago, did
the GPS hear me on?

380
00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:49.610
45 minutes.

381
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:54.850
Alright, well, we'll just get over to
the next stop and grab some snacks.


382
00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.880
All the places in this
is the one you come to?


383
00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.736
There's the closest thing to the highway.

384
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.460
No, this place won't even look like it.

385
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:16.400
Look, it's either stay hungry for another
hour or come in and grab some chips.


386
00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.180
The last thing, two minutes.

387
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.600
Cheers!

388
00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:41.870
Can I help you find anything?

389
00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:44.490
Huh?

390
00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:45.530
Do you need help?

391
00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.950
Uh, no, sorry. 
We're together, we're good.

392
00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.360
How recent is this brochure?

393
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:30.350
They updated every month.

394
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.640
They were no method device.

395
00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.460
Alright, what did I do?

396
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:45.930
Looks good.

397
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:51.270
I thought I saw something.

398
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:05.750
Thank you.

399
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:10.470
Hey, Enven Core is not done.
Where are you going?


400
00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.170
Hey, me.

401
00:30:42.171 --> 00:30:43.171
Wait.

402
00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:45.670
This is...

403
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.750
Chex and Charles pick some weirdest places.

404
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:49.930
Okay.

405
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:51.370
It's not too bad.

406
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:54.730
You know what? 
I'm not put on for thinking.

407
00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.950
For what? I'm going
to get a lot tonight.

408
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:00.770
Yeah.

409
00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:01.830
Let's go inside.

410
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.990
I'll be ready.

411
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:11.350
Good idea.

412
00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:12.810
What the hell?

413
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.990
Whoa.

414
00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:14.210
Hey.

415
00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:15.490
Hey.

416
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:18.470
Come on.

417
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:19.910
Come on.

418
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:24.550
No, they're about to leave,
but since y'all were late,


419
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:28.350
I have to record the
whole weekend on my own.


420
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:30.250
Why didn't you tell me?

421
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.190
Because you didn't read the email.

422
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:36.170
Well, that case.

423
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:37.970
Hey, Julian!

424
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:43.870
Since you was late, we poured a
shot for every time we took a shot.


425
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.180
Yeah, so y'all got to get caught up.

426
00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:51.330
So, for the next 48 hours,
we must be fucked up, bitches.


427
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:52.590
That's right.

428
00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:53.670
Hey!

429
00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:03.090
That's what I'm talking about.

430
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:22.110
No, breathe.

431
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.520
Is that a smart idea?

432
00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:26.250
No, vacation!

433
00:32:27.675 --> 00:32:29.115
I'm trying to have such a good time.

434
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:30.750
I don't remember.

435
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:33.310
I didn't know I had a
good-ass fucking time.


436
00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:35.170
True.

437
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:38.810
But there is a final line between
a drunk and a trashy white bitch.


438
00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:40.930
Oh, bitch.

439
00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:43.030
I can't be Becky.

440
00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:45.050
I can't trash you.

441
00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:49.410
Do you think I'm trashy?

442
00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:55.250
So, I'm trying to get stuff from my
man tonight, so you know I still got it.


443
00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:57.950
Yo, can y'all excuse us?

444
00:32:58.410 --> 00:32:59.590
Ain't Julian in us to focus?

445
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:02.410
Go come here as fast as we
turn out a serious conversation.


446
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:08.370
Look.

447
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:10.630
I know you said
you all had it hard.

448
00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.090
But is it really that bad?

449
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:16.950
It's bad, bad.

450
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.810
So bad, I'm trying to find
alternative ways to please him.


451
00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.810
Do you think you want the white bitch?

452
00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:36.990
I won't go give him some slagway
tea or some role playing as shit.


453
00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:38.390
No.

454
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:39.470
Listen.

455
00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:44.370
No man is worth you sacrificing
yourself to better his ego.


456
00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:46.510
So what am I supposed to do?

457
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.570
Show?

458
00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:49.130
I don't know.

459
00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.810
Listen the next lifetime by Eric Abandu.

460
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:54.590
Jackson.

461
00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:56.670
That's the dumbest shit you ever said.

462
00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:58.650
What the hell is that ever mean?

463
00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.070
Something nice.

464
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:03.250
Alright guys, thank you so much.

465
00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:04.550
We're great stuff today.

466
00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.970
So, what do y'all think?

467
00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:19.450
Great stuff.

468
00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:20.690
Oh my god, really.

469
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:21.410
Your whole friendship?

470
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:22.150
Trying a thing?

471
00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:23.410
Total reality gold.

472
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:24.790
Oh my god.

473
00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:25.870
Yeah.

474
00:34:25.871 --> 00:34:26.350
Oh yeah.

475
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:28.350
So we set up a confessional station.

476
00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:31.761
So just make sure that
you and Hudson do a video


477
00:34:31.773 --> 00:34:34.050
check-in, at least race
of day until Monday.


478
00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:37.122
Oh, and we also have
two little camera, a little


479
00:34:37.134 --> 00:34:39.290
handheld camera to
do some your old bitch.


480
00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:41.690
Now you know I'm not
the best with technology.


481
00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:43.206
I don't want to delete anything.

482
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:44.230
Oh no, it's all good.

483
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:47.830
So all the devices actually back
up to the cloud every five minutes.


484
00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:49.637
So just make sure
that you don't turn it off


485
00:34:49.649 --> 00:34:51.710
before you see backup
compete on the little screen.


486
00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:53.050
Okay, got it, got it.

487
00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:54.330
Thank you guys so much.

488
00:34:54.331 --> 00:34:55.710
I really really appreciate this.

489
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:57.790
This is a dream control for me.

490
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:58.450
Oh my god.

491
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:59.670
Oh my gosh, congratulations.

492
00:35:00.315 --> 00:35:02.710
Yes, I am so looking forward
to working more with you.


493
00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:04.010
Okay, me too.

494
00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:05.850
Alright, y'all have a wonderful weekend.

495
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.970
Thank you, you guys too.

496
00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:09.530
You guys get home safe and
I'll contact you guys on Monday.


497
00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:10.590
Yeah, that's great.

498
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:11.870
Okay, awesome.

499
00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.940
Now that's something I remember very well.

500
00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.060
I'm sure there were other
bathrooms that could have used them.


501
00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.780
Well, this was the
closest to our just figure.


502
00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.360
I'm coming here.

503
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:39.720
What do you want, Julia?

504
00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.020
Why is it always going
to be what I want?

505
00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.960
Especially when I know
it's something that you want.


506
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.260
Listen, listen, listen.

507
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:50.820
Whatever happened on that
last trip, what happened again?


508
00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.560
You sure about that?

509
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:00.710
Fuckin' pretty.

510
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:01.990
It's time to go home.

511
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:10.100
Shh, we're in a hot tent.

512
00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.700
Alright, we got crazy
bitches, but we got planned.


513
00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.140
See, you're always
going to be so organized.


514
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.400
You're just going to film with the flow.

515
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:23.680
Okay, too soon.

516
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:26.620
You okay?

517
00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.140
Yeah.

518
00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:28.880
You okay?

519
00:36:28.881 --> 00:36:28.940
You okay?

520
00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:30.580
I'm good.

521
00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:37.400
So now that we are finally
here, I like to book all the tells.


522
00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:39.780
It's a friendship.

523
00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.240
A friendship.

524
00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:01.880
A love.

525
00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:11.420
Cheers!

526
00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.440
I'm so happy to be here.

527
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.040
This is actually fun.

528
00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.300
I was talking about
my cabin, but look at it.


529
00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:21.320
He's into it.

530
00:37:29.961 --> 00:37:31.400
He's in it.

531
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.100
He's in it.

532
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:34.220
Guys, oh.

533
00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.420
Every right ever I need to take six.

534
00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.400
Six, six, seven, eight.

535
00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:40.720
Shit, I am.

536
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.800
I can't do that.

537
00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:44.580
I'm confident.

538
00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.760
She's gonna get you to the beginning.

539
00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.060
I'm just filling in right now.

540
00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.220
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

541
00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.080
I know what the
heck I just filled in.

542
00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.120
I know what you can put.

543
00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.500
I know what you can put.

544
00:37:59.060 --> 00:37:59.720
I know what you can put.

545
00:37:59.721 --> 00:38:00.961
I know not gonna lie about you.

546
00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:02.940
Oh!

547
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.080
Wasn't through the flowing.

548
00:38:07.521 --> 00:38:15.900
I'm single the way.

549
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.200
But...

550
00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:18.200
Oh boy.

551
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:19.560
Oh boy.

552
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:22.960
Oh boy.

553
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.640
Who are you, Hudson and
Julian still huff like Brabbitts?


554
00:38:31.655 --> 00:38:33.342
Instead of a reality
TV show, they need to


555
00:38:33.354 --> 00:38:35.255
hold me for a while, it's
probably not so much.


556
00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:37.740
They're so nice, Justin.

557
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.841
Who said we're not
going to bust a night?

558
00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:50.980
I haven't gotten any and over
six months and no, I'm sorry, babe.


559
00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:55.290
Come here.

560
00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:10.690
Come here.

561
00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:12.290
Fucking in the kitchen.

562
00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:15.130
What?

563
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:18.910
Okay.

564
00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:20.941
What do we put on the show?

565
00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:22.690
We made the first turn.

566
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:27.270
Make you sit private, now
you can go back home.


567
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:22.870
Oh!

568
00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:08.450
Jesus.

569
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:14.250
And you can't make some coffee?

570
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:19.510
First of all, this ain't the type of drip
coffee machine that I know how to operate.


571
00:41:20.015 --> 00:41:22.710
This is one of these fanciest
Espresso machines in the sun.


572
00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:23.930
Oh, no.

573
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:27.150
Oh, shit, June June.

574
00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:28.570
Break these good folks machine.

575
00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:29.770
I didn't break this machine.

576
00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:31.050
This thing was far from junk.

577
00:41:31.051 --> 00:41:33.110
I don't know why
you're doing that for me.

578
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.786
Just a couple of
them will die now anyway.

579
00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:35.930
I mean, I'll be on vacation.

580
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:37.410
Shit, you right?

581
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:38.170
Fuck that.

582
00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:40.990
We should do some old school
shit like go to iHOP or something.


583
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:43.510
That's what I'm talking about!

584
00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:48.310
You know we can hit up those onion eat
pancakes deals like you see in college?


585
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:50.450
Yeah, and we'd be douching for days.

586
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:52.630
Those were some rough times.

587
00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:55.590
Morning.

588
00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:57.110
Yeah, I made no coffee.

589
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:58.830
Julian ripped the machine.

590
00:41:59.250 --> 00:41:59.330
What?

591
00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:01.810
You better not get
us a family to you.

592
00:42:02.405 --> 00:42:03.450
Chow, calm down.

593
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:08.030
All we need to do is take a picture
of it, go to the store, and replace it.


594
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:09.450
Don't ever know.

595
00:42:09.825 --> 00:42:11.065
That's actually not a bad idea.

596
00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:12.930
I wonder what else you
don't broke up in this.


597
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.230
Don't start with me, Charles.

598
00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:15.010
Put it away.

599
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:18.090
We're gonna end up a local diner
for breakfast if you want to join.


600
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:19.650
Okay?

601
00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:20.880
Go wake up, Jackson.

602
00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:22.210
Go to your ass.

603
00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:23.510
Huh?

604
00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:24.410
Huh?

605
00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:25.050
Oh, that's for you.

606
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:26.510
Where you going?

607
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.290
Oh, she nailed on her.

608
00:42:28.291 --> 00:42:36.400
I don't know if I'm
going to get in here.

609
00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:36.900
I know.

610
00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.340
It's kind of dead up in here.

611
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.100
Of course.

612
00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:45.940
Welcome to the best food in town.

613
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.300
Morning.

614
00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:51.780
Thanks, baby.

615
00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.240
Is it me?

616
00:43:00.255 --> 00:43:02.020
Or do I feel
like the girls are gagging?

617
00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:03.540
Yeah, I see you.

618
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.900
I see you.

619
00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:05.740
Okay.

620
00:43:05.741 --> 00:43:05.900
Okay.

621
00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:06.640
All right.

622
00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:09.420
You're wondering what all these
bags have to do with Thomas Pro.


623
00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:10.640
That part.

624
00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:11.440
Really?

625
00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.560
If you have to stop putting on a
shoulder, then what would happen?


626
00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.160
Ain't nobody putting on a shoulder.

627
00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:20.840
What?

628
00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.080
I stay corrected.

629
00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:23.860
I trust you.

630
00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:31.180
I will judge you some
more water in just a moment.


631
00:43:31.181 --> 00:43:32.620
Thank you.

632
00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.100
All right.

633
00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:39.460
Okay, John, what can I get for you?

634
00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:44.640
Uh, can I have the American
breakfast instead of sausage?


635
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.080
Can I have bacon?

636
00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.280
She's saying honey.

637
00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:47.640
Thanks.

638
00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:51.360
Can I get three eggs
scrambled with toast, please?


639
00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:51.880
Uh-huh.

640
00:43:51.881 --> 00:43:52.881
A little ranch bag.

641
00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.480
I'm just going to do the
American breakfast as it comes.


642
00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:57.900
Okay.

643
00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:01.940
How can I get the French toast,
scrambled eggs, and avocados?


644
00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:03.440
Of course.

645
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.200
What about you, honey?

646
00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:08.380
I'm so indecisive.

647
00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.480
I'll take...

648
00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.040
Oh!

649
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.080
What's wrong with her?

650
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.020
When are you here?

651
00:44:30.021 --> 00:44:31.460
No, no, no, no.

652
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:03.830
Oh, Kevin.

653
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:04.850
I have it.

654
00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:05.530
Please.

655
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.470
Baby.

656
00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:08.210
And I'm so sorry.

657
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:12.130
But... Hey, I need you.

658
00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.210
Don't let me.

659
00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:16.010
Please, come.

660
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:17.290
Come back.

661
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:17.490
Come.

662
00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:19.370
Come back.

663
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:20.670
Come back to me.

664
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:22.230
Come back.

665
00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:23.510
Oh, Kevin.

666
00:46:47.635 --> 00:46:57.635
Kevin.

667
00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:42.840
It's the time we are, right?

668
00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:43.980
We're having a blast.

669
00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:45.720
Mm-hmm.

670
00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:47.340
Mm-hmm.

671
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.440
So what you want to do?

672
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.200
What you mean?

673
00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:51.460
I mean, we're in nature.

674
00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:52.900
That's just something nature-y.

675
00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:54.900
It's so crazy to be here.

676
00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:01.800
Fuckin' Julia.

677
00:48:02.305 --> 00:48:03.986
Well, we're trying to play game this year.

678
00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:05.220
Goddamn, Julian.

679
00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:06.540
Go back into house.

680
00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.200
I was trying to be a boy.

681
00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.480
You ain't nothin' to stay here.

682
00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:11.220
Mm-hmm.

683
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.880
Looks all good around these trees.

684
00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.120
Boy, it's just fucking like these.

685
00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.920
Mm-hmm.

686
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.120
Mm-hmm.

687
00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:30.090
All right, Julian enough.

688
00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:32.730
Like I said, let us fucking piece, please.

689
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:38.630
I'm almost there.

690
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:39.470
Who's there?

691
00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:40.810
What is that?

692
00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:41.930
Charles!

693
00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:44.550
Go back in!

694
00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:53.670
That's your day, motherfucker.

695
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:55.190
What?

696
00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:57.010
What is this?

697
00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:58.470
What is this?

698
00:48:58.471 --> 00:48:59.471
What is this?

699
00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:05.290
Help!

700
00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:06.810
Help!

701
00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:11.590
What the hell happened?

702
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:13.970
Hell, I know right back in the woods.

703
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:15.670
Took my hoop.

704
00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.790
Someone had a knife and stabbed Jack's.

705
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:18.870
Look, let me see.

706
00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:21.770
We have to go to the hospital.

707
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:23.270
Oh, hell no.

708
00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:24.190
I don't need to ignore it.

709
00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:24.650
I almost got killed.

710
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:26.150
It's like I'm taking a voice.

711
00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:27.090
What do you want us to do?

712
00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:27.530
Three.

713
00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:29.030
Catch me up.

714
00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:32.610
Sorry, Jack.

715
00:49:32.611 --> 00:49:32.730
Hey!

716
00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:34.610
I have to make sure no
organs are punctured.


717
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.970
It's country.

718
00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:36.290
I have folks out here.

719
00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:38.770
Everything feels okay.

720
00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:41.010
I have a kid in
the car to soak the wound.

721
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:42.230
Get him inside!

722
00:49:44.691 --> 00:49:44.821
Get him.

723
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.930
Get him over.

724
00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:46.730
Let's go.

725
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:54.590
There's an overtime undocumented man.

726
00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:58.390
John, let me tell you.

727
00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:00.110
Do not come to the
back of the woods cabin.

728
00:50:00.111 --> 00:50:02.010
They are the girl of a carrion.

729
00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:03.930
And a psycho butch
bitch just cut it myself.


730
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:05.870
And not in a good way.

731
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:08.050
Hell, are you fucking serious?

732
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:09.946
I know everything that's going on.

733
00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:11.210
You want to care this shit?

734
00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:12.610
Have to calm down.

735
00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:15.210
No, you need to fucking
get with the program, Julian.


736
00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.270
People matter more than fame.

737
00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:18.730
Or money.

738
00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:20.530
I've had just about enough of this shit.

739
00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:21.890
And what's that supposed to mean?

740
00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:23.550
Mr. White, I'm sorry to bother you,

741
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:25.890
but I want to give you an
update on the Dr. Johnson.


742
00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:27.970
This is not such a joke.

743
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.730
Yeah, I understand.

744
00:50:28.731 --> 00:50:29.731
I understand.

745
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:32.610
But just to let you know,
we had another incident


746
00:50:32.611 --> 00:50:34.430
earlier and we think
we found the connection.


747
00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:35.990
Huh?

748
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:37.250
What connection?

749
00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:40.490
I think the killer is trying to guard
Mr. Johnson's entire medical team.


750
00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:43.830
And unfortunately, your
husband was on that team.


751
00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:46.690
Mr. White?

752
00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:48.170
Mr. White?

753
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:50.130
Is there anything over here?

754
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:53.070
I think we might have a problem.

755
00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.860
What is happening?

756
00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.920
What is happening?

757
00:51:12.921 --> 00:51:13.921
Where are you going?

758
00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.080
What are you?

759
00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:18.660
Julian!

760
00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:20.740
Julian!

761
00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.480
We're not here.

762
00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:35.000
Wait a minute.

763
00:51:35.001 --> 00:51:38.040
I know, I know.

764
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:43.480
I know I know.

765
00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:44.740
Fuck!

766
00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:45.940
Fuck!

767
00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.320
Fuck!

768
00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.480
Come on motherfucker.

769
00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:52.960
Fuck!

770
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:24.310
bring.

771
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:39.690
dropping go and Bacal I have a.

772
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:32.060
Hey, uh, Mr. What? Mr. Why? Mr. Why? Mr. Why
is? Hey, listen, um, my condolences to


773
00:53:39.061 --> 00:53:43.981
your friend here. I'm, I'm
really sorry. This is, this


774
00:53:43.993 --> 00:53:48.560
is all real. Man, this
is, this is very real. Hey,


775
00:53:48.561 --> 00:53:52.312
fellas, we gotta get to
the bottom of this quick.


776
00:53:52.324 --> 00:53:56.240
Do y'all have any idea?
Any leads on how we can get


777
00:53:56.241 --> 00:54:00.796
started? I think I know
where I can start. Where are


778
00:54:00.808 --> 00:54:05.200
you going? Hey, hey,
Charles, get you in. You guys


779
00:54:05.201 --> 00:54:08.810
calling me? Hey, no,
your fella, don't go. No,


780
00:54:08.822 --> 00:54:12.680
Mr. Why? Hey, hey,
listen, listen, fellas. I need


781
00:54:12.681 --> 00:54:20.720
y'all to let law enforcement handle this. I
will once I get my husband back. Hey, don't


782
00:54:20.721 --> 00:54:25.300
go. Fellas, listen to me. Seriously.
Hey, hey, fellas. Listen.


783
00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:35.300
Oh, why are we here?
The waitress had earlier


784
00:54:52.312 --> 00:54:57.470
today. The waitress
looked at me like she knows


785
00:55:15.471 --> 00:55:20.235
him. Can I help you,
honey? Hey, uh, we came


786
00:55:20.247 --> 00:55:25.240
here earlier. The
waitress, that's a, that's a


787
00:55:25.241 --> 00:55:27.729
rare issue. I don't
know who you're talking


788
00:55:27.741 --> 00:55:30.300
about. It was a couple
of us who worked this


789
00:55:30.301 --> 00:55:33.064
shift. Girl, we're talking
about a butch looking


790
00:55:33.076 --> 00:55:35.620
lady who made a scene
when she saw my friend


791
00:55:35.621 --> 00:55:38.452
and dropped the water
picture. Oh dear, you


792
00:55:38.464 --> 00:55:41.440
mean Linda? Well,
she's off tonight. Does she


793
00:55:41.441 --> 00:55:43.969
live in the area? Oh
dear, I can't give you


794
00:55:43.981 --> 00:55:46.580
that personal information.
We understand. We


795
00:55:46.581 --> 00:55:50.268
came because we're
once given 10. She had


796
00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:54.520
great service. Oh, well,
she does live near. If


797
00:55:54.521 --> 00:55:57.951
you want to leave it
here, I'll make sure that


798
00:55:57.963 --> 00:56:01.180
she gets it on her
next shift. Here you go.


799
00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:13.118
What? Fine. You gentlemen
are godsend. She will


800
00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:18.770
be floored. Yeah, well,
we're just trying to be


801
00:56:18.771 --> 00:56:24.709
a light in this damn world.
Amen. So what now?


802
00:56:41.721 --> 00:56:47.671
Wait, wait. What? Oh
my gosh, this is amazing.


803
00:57:04.845 --> 00:57:10.310
Okay. Here we go. Oh, and do you think this
is a good idea? Charles, I'm just gonna ask


804
00:57:16.311 --> 00:57:21.589
you a few questions.
That's it. Is this too


805
00:57:38.601 --> 00:57:44.410
much? Guys, don't
worry. I'm gonna make sure


806
00:58:01.411 --> 00:58:02.816
you're lucky, and
make sure you're lucky.


807
00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:08.440
Oh my gosh, we're so
lucky. Oh my gosh, we're


808
00:58:17.452 --> 00:58:23.090
so lucky. God! Oh my
gosh, we're so lucky!


809
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:44.590
Let's go and get outta here honey.

810
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:48.390
It's me.

811
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:05.850
Okay.

812
00:59:07.425 --> 00:59:08.970
Okay, okay.

813
00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:26.950
I'm okay.

814
00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:37.520
I can't see these cuffs.

815
00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:48.669
My sweet, sweet little
boy. I heard some promotion


816
00:59:48.681 --> 00:59:52.380
going on and I wanted
to make sure you were


817
00:59:52.381 --> 00:59:56.081
alright. And then I saw
this gentleman and I


818
00:59:56.093 --> 00:59:59.720
thought it was my
son. I was like, he looks


819
00:59:59.721 --> 01:00:06.550
uncomfortable. Kevin, Kevin, before you go
and give yourself all of a sec, I was just


820
01:00:06.551 --> 01:00:12.810
going to help. Okay, baby.
I'm in no harm, please. Kevin, no!


821
01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:29.332
You know, I don't
think we should be over


822
01:01:37.344 --> 01:01:42.720
here like this, or you
can go back to the car.


823
01:01:52.721 --> 01:01:54.441
So I can be stanched
like a ball of a tail?

824
01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:16.820
Oh, motherfucker!

825
01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:22.320
Oh, my God, Jackson, hi!

826
01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:43.980
It's this whole time you haven't gone?

827
01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:54.360
No. Got it from his mom's room.
Guess she knew this thing was coming.


828
01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.860
Bitch, don't think I don't
know you fuck my man.


829
01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:22.940
Girl!

830
01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:26.500
But we'll have a rest here later.
