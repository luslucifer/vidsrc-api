DETECTIVE TYLAR: One female
in her late thirties
and three minors.


37
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.610
Multiple stab wounds
and blunt-force trauma.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.700
CAPTAIN MACKIE: What about
the ex-husband?


39
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.510
Court said the wife
had a restraining order
against him.


40
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.690
Dylan Benet.
He spent the night with
a bottle of Jack Daniel's.


41
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.610
It was his
first Christmas
without his family.


42
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.670
MACKIE: All the more reason.

43
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.660
TYLAR: Well
you didn't see him
when he ID-ed his family.


44
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.590
Looked like he'd been
hit by a freight train.


45
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.630
DETECTIVE SHAY:
Seeing his kids like that.
All the blood.


46
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.660
Yeah, it was definitely
a nightmare for him.


47
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.590
TYLAR: If this guy did it,
he gets my vote for
a goddamn Academy Award.


48
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.520
Let's say the stepfather,
this Grady Edwards did it.


49
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.500
What do we got on him?
Nothing.


50
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.580
Said he was from Kansas.

51
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.610
SHAY: Except we can't find
a match in any database.


52
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.730
And he stopped the newspaper
to have time to disappear.


53
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.510
And we think he might
have done this before.


54
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.530
Three years ago
in New Jersey,
a wife and three kids.


55
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.730
Gunshot wounds to
the back of the head.
The stepfather disappeared.


56
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.550
Lived in a rented room
where he met the victims.


57
00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.630
Both rooms were owned
by older women.


58
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.630
One of the women
who lives in New Jersey said,


59
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.470
''He's a wonderful man,
always paid his rent
on time and in cash.''


60
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.590
So, of course,
she never asked him
for any identification.


61
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.630
SHAY: No, he's smart.
The Toyota Land Cruiser
that we found abandoned?


62
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.760
Paid for in cash.
No driver's license
required for registration.


63
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.690
TYLAR: No credit cards,
no anything. Which means...


64
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.490
MACKIE: No photo ID required.

65
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.650
SHAY: Always a divorced
or widowed situation.


66
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.580
TYLAR: I'm telling you,
this guy's a monster.


67
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.760
Even if this is your guy,

68
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.500
It's been six months.
He could be anywhere by now.


69
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.520
SEAN: Mom, Beth says
I can't get these.


70
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.760
Sean, we're not
getting these.
Hey! You two stop arguing.


71
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.760
Why does she always get
to pick the kind of cookies
we get? It's not fair!


72
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.760
Life is not fair.
Life is about the woman
getting to pick the cookies.


73
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.570
Sorry, they get a little
out of control sometimes.


74
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.560
They're just kids.

75
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.720
But the sooner you figure out
the cookie deal, the easier
your life's going to be.


76
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.570
I'm just saying.

77
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.720
It's a woman's world
and we're just guests here.


78
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.570
Wise man. I'd say
your wife is very lucky.


79
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.600
Oh. Uh, I'm not
married anymore.

It's okay.

84
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.720
I could use
a little help, though.

I just moved to Portland
and I don't know
this store yet.


88

It's actually
two aisles over.

Uh-huh.

I'd think you were
following me.

No. Hey.

96
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.620

Pizza?
The truth is,


101
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.680

some adult conversation.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.560
So, have you met this guy?

116
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.620
Yeah, a couple of times.
You know, when I came by
to say hi to your mom.


117
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.710
He seems cool.
Okay, but she's
only known him since,


118
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.700
what, like,
after Christmas?
That's so fast.

Well...

Come on, give it
a chance. You know?

Before you do
something stupid.


122
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.530
Like what?

123
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.740
I don't know. Like, um,

124
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.560
irritating your mom
and getting sent
back to military school.


125

I'm just saying, it seems like
she's rushing into things.
Don't you think?


126
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.500
I think it's her
business what she does
with her personal life.


127
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.760
And she tends to
screw that up, mostly.

Come on, Michael,
chill on this one, please?
No fights with your mom.

Hi, sweetie.

Let me look at you.
Your hair's gotten longer.

Yeah. They ease up
on you after a year.

You look so...

141
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.630
So much like a man.
I was expecting a boy.


142
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.530
That's what the military does.
Builds men. Good, strong men.

Michael, this is David.
David, Michael.

No.

146
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.670
It wasn't real military.
It was just a school
for screw-up's.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.700
Oh.

148

Well
good to finally meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

Everything seems
to be going great.

Sean and Beth love him.

151
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.600
What's not to love?

152
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.590
Yeah, he's almost
too good to be true.

{CHUCKLING}
Don't start, Jackie.


154
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.650
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
I like him.

crazy to be engaged

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.640
to someone I've only
known for six months?


157
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.540
You've always been crazy.
That has nothing
to do with him.


158
00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:20.720
He seems a little crazy,
too, about you.


159
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.570
DAVID: Everyone have
enough to eat?
ALL: Yeah...


160
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.550
I would like to
propose a toast.


161
00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.670
First of all
I want to the' ask Susan
and Sean and Beth,


162
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.570
who, in a very short time,
have taken me in
and made me feel at home.


163
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.710
This is... It's a dream
come true for me.


164
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.540
Thank you.

165
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:47.630
And to Michael.
Your return makes
us complete.


166
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.570
Family is
the most important thing.
Without it, we have nothing.


167
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.470
Welcome home, Michael.

168
00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.530
Hear, hear.

169
00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.590
MAN: Hear, hear, Michael.

170
00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.760
I think I'm a little
nauseous after that.


171
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.580
Stop it.

172
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.710
You want something
to drink?
No, no, no, I got this.


173
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.640
We have a surprise
for you, too.


174
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.690
Really?
Jackie pulled a few strings


175
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.530
and she can get you a job
working with her as
a real estate agent.


176
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.670
Oh, I couldn't.

177
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.580
Wait a minute.
Of course you can.


178
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.530
Okay? Just follow me around
and I'll get you all set up.


179
00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:21.660
It's a great
opportunity for us


180
00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.530
and she really
went out of her way.


181
00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:28.510
Well, I can't say no
to my bride-to-be
or her sister, can I?


182
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.520
Thank you, Jackie.
Don't thank me. Thank her.


183
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.640
Because she's
the one who convinced me
to get you off the road


184
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.550
so she can keep
an eye on you.


185
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.750
Oh. Did you?

186
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.530
Thank you.
I'm going to go have
a word with your son.


187
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.720
God, I hope Michael
takes to him.


188
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:50.740
He will. He's just been
blindsided by the divorce.


189
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.620
He'll bounce back.

190
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:56.600
Michael.
Give me four minutes.
Meet me in the basement.


191
00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.580
So, what'd he say?

192
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:05.680
He said he wants me to
meet him in the basement.


193
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.670
in the basement?
Yeah.


194
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.630
Why?

195
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.660
I don't know.
Well, I guess I'm
about to find out.


196
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.680
Those two are mine.
But you're welcome
to use the others.


197
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:57.690
What's all this for?

198
00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:01.490
Well, I'm a bit of
a wannabe carpenter.


199
00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.520
I built these
storage cabinets myself.


200
00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.490
And I'm working up
in the attic right now
on some termite damage.


201
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.510
I think we need
a real toast.


202
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:11.720
Just the guys.

203
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.540
This is where
I keep the good stuff.


204
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.500
There we go.

205
00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.470
Now, don't let your mom know
I've got a tequila stash.


206
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:28.560
I've worked my ass off
trying to convince her
I'm perfect.


207
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.590
I know this must
be a bit of a shock,


208
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.590
your mom and me
getting married and all,


209
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.630
but I want you
to know, I want us


210
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:38.760
to be a real family.

211
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.620
Because without it,
we have nothing?


212
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.510
Oh.

213
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.560
Okay. TouchÃ©.

214
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.740
So I get a little
corny sometimes,
but I meant what I said.


215
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.470
You just let me
handle your mother,


216
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.490
and I'm going to make
sure you stay right here,
where you belong.


217
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.620
No more military school.

218
00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.650
We're going to put this
family back together,
you and me,


219
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.710
father and son.

220
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:02.500
Stepfather.

221
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:04.600
Stepfather

222
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:07.480
and son.

223
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.660
That's smooth, isn't it?

224
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.490
{COUGHS}

225
00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.680
So your mother tells me
you're one hell of a swimmer.


226
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:19.520
Yeah, I do okay.

227
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:23.540
You know, I used to
swim in competition.
In college, at U of O.


228
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.470
Your senior year is
going to be very important.


229
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.600
You could maybe get
a college scholarship
swimming.


230
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.710
You should be
training this summer.


231
00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.630
It's kind of hard to
train in a backyard pool.


232
00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.600
Maybe. But I hear
your old school has
a summer swim program.


233
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.470
It does, but I can't
use that pool anymore.


234
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:40.660
That's the past.

235
00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.710
Here is to the future.

236
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.710
Remember,
I have to go see my
grandparents tomorrow.


237
00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.660
Yeah, that's right.
But I'll be back
the day after. I'm sorry.


238
00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.600
No, that's all right.
I mean, it's the day
I get back,


239
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.640
but that's fine.
It call someone else.


240
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:58.660
Shut up. I'm sorry.

241
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:00.760
Listen, I want to
get my license.


242
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.580
So, can you take me
by the DMV?


243
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.630
Maybe.
I'll think about it.


244
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.700
Why not?

245
00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.580
I kind of like having you
dependent on me, actually.


246
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:12.640
All right, get in the car.

247
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.670
Good night.

248
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:14.720
Good night.

249

Good night, Leah.
Bye.


250
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.580
Glad you're home, Michael.

251
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:26.700
Thanks, Aunt Jackie.
I'm so glad to be home.
Thank you for coming.


252
00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.500
KELLY: Do you think
David meant what he said


253
00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:41.700
about getting your
mom to let you stay?


254
00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.660
He said he was
going to make it happen,
so we'll see.


255
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.630
Sweet. Bye.

A lot for one day, huh?

258

No, no, it was...
It was nice. Thanks.


259
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.620
I'm trying too hard.
You can say it.


260
00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:08.600
Look, Michael, I know
it's difficult to come home
to another man in the house.


261
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.560
I just need you to
try and get along, okay?


262
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:14.480
Mom, can we just hold
the lectures, please?


263
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.520
I've been home
for two seconds.


264
00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:19.680
Okay.

265
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.600
He's a really good guy.

266
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.700
And he cares about me
and we're trying to
start a new life together.


267
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:26.720
And you don't want
me to mess that up.


268
00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.470
Well, that's not fair.

269
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.660
No, no, no, I get it.
I'll try not to inconvenience
you and your new life.


270
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.720
Michael.
I'm sorry. I, um...


271
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.560
I'm pretty tired, Mom.

272
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.760
Okay. Okay.

273
00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:42.520
Good night.

SUSAN: Maybe he should
stay there his senior year.


275
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.630
But his place is
here with his family.


276
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.510
Yeah, but you don't
know what he was like.


277
00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.660
The kids he was
hanging out with,
the lying.


278
00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.760
His temper was
out of control.


279
00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.600
Believe me,
I want him here more than
anything in the world.

I just hope he's ready.

You're right.

Well, it depends.

with Mrs. Rivers,

a very open-minded woman.

Yeah, that's incredible.

There's no guarantee
they'll let you back
in the fall.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.480
But we'll work on that later.

cool that he actually did
what he said he was going to do.

I know. I know.

See, I told you everything
was going to work out.

Yeah, maybe you're right.

Um. Yeah.
I'll be by around 10:00.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.480
Yeah, that sounds good.
All right.

Do you think it's a good idea
they're so passionate
at their age?

They've known each other

You should stop being
so old-fashioned.

I think it's so lucky
that your mom met David.

Maybe I don't want
to stay here with you.

Maybe you want to go
back to an all-boys

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.690
Maybe.
Mmm-hmm.

That's why we

Because I like
you looking at me.

I've missed family
dinners like this.

You've missed them?
Does that mean you
were married before?

Oh.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.530
I had no idea.
I'm sorry, David.
I'm sorry.


352
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.560
I guess that's why family
is so important to me,
Michael.


353

SUSAN: Well
family is important.


354
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.730
We haven't always had
such great experiences
as a family.

Hey, it wasn't all
Dad's fault.

No, I didn't say it was.

BETH: But, you know,
our family wasn't that bad.


358

I saw on TV this woman who
drove off a bridge with her
three kids in the back seat.

That is so not
dinner-table conversation,
young lady.

They all drowned.
That kind of thing
really gets to me,


361
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.530
that someone
could do that to
her own children.


362
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.610
It makes you wonder,
though, what it takes


363
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.660
to make someone do
something so sick.


364
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.670
Okay. Can we change
the conversation?
Yeah, I'm sorry.

Aren't you going to

No.

What?

you're getting shotgun.

Back on Sunday.
They're going to camp.

We have a million
things to do.

going to camp.

I'm only in town
a couple days.

I'm taking the kids
to a Blazers game.


381
00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.730
They can spend the night
with me at the hotel.
I'll have them back tomorrow.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:27.670
Where's the co-ed girlfriend?

383
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:29.740
That's over.

384
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:31.760
Actually, she was
working for a Ph.D.


385
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:33.610
She wasn't that much
younger than you were.

better care of herself,
that's all.

as ''The Cat Lady.''

What'd she want?

that she had seen

this story on

not to laugh in her face.

You know Erica Harmon, right?
Mmm-hmm.


423

Okay, so a couple years ago,
she tells Erica Harmon's
husband


424
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:35.730
that Erica is having an affair
because she sees this man
sneaking into their house


425
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:37.760
every morning
just after he leaves.


426

And was she?

427
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.660
Well, yeah.

428
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.750
Well, there you go, then.
Well, it wasn't
any of her business


429
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:45.690
and she told
the entire neighbourhood
before she told him.


430
00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.550
Great. This'll make me
a hit with the neighbours, huh?


431
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.580
I got to go.

432
00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:00.550
I think I'd rather be
the mystery man sneaking
into Mrs. Harmon's house.


433
00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:01.630
What's she look like?

talk to you about was, um...

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.490
Well, I need a favour.

456
00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.490
Well, what kind of favour?

457
00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.760
I'd like you to
be my best man.


458
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.530

I'd really be
honoured if you would.

I'd rather have.

a little carried away
with the whole family thing,


461
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:29.690
but, you know, truth is,
I'm really happy you're home.


462
00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.490
And like I said,
I'm going to make sure
you stay home


463
00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.730
and this family
stays complete. Right?


464
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.500
Here you go.
Thank you.


465
00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:39.610
So, uh,

466
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.510
what do you say?

467
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.500
Well...

468
00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.490
I know it would make
your mother very happy.


469
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:50.690
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

470
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:52.660
That's great. That is great!

471
00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.600
You know, without sounding
too sentimental,
I want to tell you,


472
00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.530
meeting your mother
that day in the supermarket
changed my life.


473
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:02.600
It was hard, you know,

474
00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.750
after what happened
to my wife and daughter.
Mmm-hmm.


475
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.680
My little Michelle
was my whole world,
my whole life.


476
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:11.610
Watching her grow
up was everything.


477
00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:16.660
You'll understand
what I'm talking about when
you have kids of your own.


478
00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:18.760
Not that you and Kelly
should be rushing into
anything. Okay?


479
00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:20.710
No, no, no. Don't worry.

480
00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.620
You got years to
go if you're smart.


481
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:29.560
When it happens,
I think you'll
see what I mean.


482
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:31.740
They're everything.

483
00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:36.570
Lisa would have
turned 11 next week.


484
00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:39.650
Who's Lisa?

485
00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:41.570
My daughter.

486
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:42.740
Thanks.
Pleasure.


487
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:45.530
I'm sorry.
I thought you said
her name was Michelle.


488
00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:48.550
Did I?

489
00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.570
Mmm-hmm.

490
00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:54.630
It's Lisa-Michelle.
You must have heard it wrong.

I just want you
to be careful.

She seems like
a very nice young woman.

should be more discreet

around his neck and it hurt.

it's a little weird

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:07.560
that I ask for some
background information,
and suddenly,


809
00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:09.550
he doesn't want to sell
real estate anymore?

going to give Jay a call.

That's okay.
No, it's not okay.

He's never been
there for you like
a father should be.


825

And part of that's my fault

should have allowed it
to go on as long as it did.

And then his daughter.


920
00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:15.670
How do you mix up
your daughter's
name like that?


921
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:20.570
He didn't.
Her name was Lisa-Michelle.
That's what you said he said.


922
00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.700
I said he said that.
But you weren't there.
Right?


923
00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:24.580
You didn't see his face.
It's in his face.


924
00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.750
Let me get this straight,
all right?


925
00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:29.740
The neighbourhood weirdo...
Yeah.


926
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:32.490
...sees a show
about a man who
kills his family


927
00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:36.670
and then you think
that David mixed up
the name of his daughter,


928
00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:40.550
so therefore
he's the guy that
killed his family?


929
00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:41.740
I don't know.

930
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:44.520
Yeah, that all
adds up to me.


931
00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:49.600
## Really too late to call

932
00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:53.510
Look, you said
your dad checked
up on him, right?


933
00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:55.540
And everything was cool.
Yeah.


934
00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:57.550
Okay, then. Right?

935
00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:01.560
It's fine. Relax.

936
00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:11.530
## To know me as hardly golden

937
00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:13.480
Are we going to finish these?

938
00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.550
Babe, come on.

939
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:18.470
Damn it, Michael.

940
00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:21.530

Michael.

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:36.700
You're obsessing.

944
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:38.740
You know, you're just
a little freaked out


945
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:41.750
that your mom's
marrying a stranger.


946
00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:45.520
I was the same way
when my mom was
going to marry Jack.


947
00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:49.530
You know? And then
he turned out to be cool.


948
00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:53.720
If you're going to
obsess about something,


949
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:56.470
you should obsess
about something that
really matters.


950
00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:58.560
Like what?

951
00:59:58.750 --> 01:00:00.540
Like me.

952
01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:07.530
I don't want to have
another long-distance
relationship with you.

Will you two be all right?

957
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:37.640
Yeah, why wouldn't we be?

Michael,
did you ever hear
from your dad?


989
01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:44.630
Well, I got a text
message from him, so...


990
01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:46.660
Really? What'd he say?

991
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:51.720
Just that he was sorry
for not coming by
before his flight.


992
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:54.720
I've tried calling
a couple times and I just
get his voicemail, so...


993
01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:58.520
I don't know.
I'll probably text
him tonight.

Honey, I'm sure he
just got crazy with work.
You know how Dad gets.

Yeah, yeah. No, I know.

Yes, I'm fine.

I almost pissed my pants,
I was so scared.

You know, that's not
a turn-on, by the way.

Michael, shut up.
I'm being serious.

I know. I know.
You do?


1003
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:38.490
Yeah. I mean,
I've been thinking about


1004
01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.620
what you said,
about all of it, really.


1005
01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:43.650
And I've decided that...

1006
01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:47.630
That you're right.
I mean, maybe, maybe,
I am obsessing.

I mean, my dad said
he was all right, so...

Uh, fine.

1022
01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:27.500
Maybe I'm wrong,
but for a while there,


1023
01:06:27.530 --> 01:06:29.630
I thought we were
off to a good start.


1024
01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:34.530
And now I'm getting the
feeling that somehow we're
not on the same page.

I know it can't
happen overnight, Michael.

But for the sake
of the family,


1027
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:44.740
you got to understand
that things are going
to change around here.

01:08:06.490 --> 01:08:07.630
Please,
that's all I'm asking.


1041
01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:12.700
There is a resemblance.
You got to admit,
it kind of looks like him.


1042
01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:21.500
You know who this
actually looks like?


1043
01:08:21.730 --> 01:08:24.650
It looks like Mr. Rockwell,
our biology teacher
from freshman year.


1044
01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.550
No, you hardly looked at it.
All right.
It could be anybody.


1045
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:30.480
Look, this is Grady Edwards.
The police couldn't match
his ID.


1046
01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.620
They couldn't
trace any fingerprints.
And there are similarities.


1047
01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:35.490
He said he was in sales.
He said he travelled a lot.


1048
01:08:35.530 --> 01:08:36.660
They can never find
any pictures of him either,


1049
01:08:36.690 --> 01:08:37.740
so I asked Beth
this morning


1050
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:40.690
if she could find any
pictures of him in the house,
any pictures of David.


1051
01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.690
There aren't any because
he doesn't like having
his picture taken, apparently.


1052
01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.520
So what?
Neither do I.


1053
01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:47.670
But I swear
I didn't kill that woman
and her kids. Okay?


1054
01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:48.700
It doesn't prove anything.

1055
01:08:48.730 --> 01:08:50.570
The website was in
the browser history.


1056
01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:51.630
He was checking it out.

1057
01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:52.720
So what if he was?

1058
01:08:53.650 --> 01:08:55.480
Or maybe it was your mom.

1059
01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:56.710
Or maybe they both
were because they were


1060
01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:59.500
curious about what
Mrs. Cutter said.


1061
01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:02.490
I mean, that's what
made you check it out.


1062
01:09:02.610 --> 01:09:03.740
All right.

1063
01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:06.710

You just don't want to go
to college with me anymore?


1067
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:35.610
By the way,

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.720
Call me later.
Or, you know what,


1072
01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:53.590
don't actually.
I don't care. Whatever.
You know.


1073
01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:54.740

1075
01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:13.580
I'm sorry.
God, I didn't even know
you were there.


1076
01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:15.510
You scared me, Mr. Harris.

1077
01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:16.670
Call me David.

1078
01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.520
I was just getting
myself a lemonade.
Do you want one?


1079
01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:23.680
No, that's okay.

1080
01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:29.540
Looked like Michael
and you were having
a bit of a fight.


1081
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:33.580
No.

1082
01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:37.620
It's nothing, really.

1083
01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:40.680
Anything I can
help you with?


1084
01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:41.750
No, it's cool.

1085
01:10:42.490 --> 01:10:43.480
You sure?

1086
01:10:44.530 --> 01:10:46.510
Something seems to
be troubling him.


1087
01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:48.480
Maybe the two of us
can help him work it out.


1088
01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:55.650
I don't know. It's just...

1089
01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:59.690
I don't get it.
He's been such a jerk lately.


1090
01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:03.580
It's called being a guy.
We're all jerks.


1091
01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:07.540
That's why you women like us.
We're like projects
you take on.

1094
01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:20.480
young women like you
seem to mature faster.


1095
01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:23.690
It takes boys a little
longer to catch up.


1096
01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:28.680
You know,
you might be a part of
the Harding family one day.


1097
01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:33.540
And I'd like you to
think of me as you would
the others, as family, too.


1098
01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:35.760
Yeah, I do.

1099
01:11:36.490 --> 01:11:38.720
I mean, you know, I will.

1100
01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:44.700
And if you ever
need anything,


1101
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.530
please come to me.

1102
01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.490
Especially if it
concerns Michael.


1103
01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:58.560
Neither of us
want to see him do
something stupid, do we?


1104
01:11:58.590 --> 01:12:00.750
Something that might
get him sent back
to military school.


1105
01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:02.750
He won't.

1106
01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:06.660
But thank you, Mr. Harris.

1107
01:12:07.710 --> 01:12:10.660

Hey, it's me.

I'll try to call you
in the next few days.

01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:10.740
Want to talk to
you about David.

I have to call
you back on that,

but the money sounds like
we're in the ballpark.

We'll talk tomorrow.
All right.

You look like you've
seen a ghost.

No, I, um...

1129
01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:02.710
I heard a phone ring.
I thought it sounded


1130
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:04.630
like it was coming
from the basement.


1131
01:14:04.670 --> 01:14:09.500
You probably just heard mine.
I got a call on a job.
I think I'm going to take it.


1132
01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:12.580
Money sounds good.
I won't have to travel much.


1133
01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:16.660
Hey, where's the key?
David, where's the key
to the basement?


1134
01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:18.650
Yeah, I was wondering
that myself.


1135
01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:21.600
I needed to get some of
my tools this morning.
The key was gone.


1136
01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:23.600
Someone took it out
and forgot to put it back.


1137
01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:25.670
Forgot to put what back?

1138

Hey, honey.
Hey, guys.


1139
01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:29.560
DAVID: That key to the lock
on the basement door
is missing.


1140
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:31.650
I'll call a locksmith
in the morning.


1141
01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.530
Better yet,

1142
01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:35.540
I'll go down to
Home Depot and
get a replacement.


1143
01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:37.480
That lock was getting old.

1144
01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:40.710
I can do the work myself.
By the way,


1145
01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.660
I think I found a job.

SUSAN: That's fantastic.

1147
01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:48.520
Yeah, the pay's good
and very little travel.


1148
01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:51.540
I like that.
I thought you would.


1149
01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.620
Let's celebrate.
Okay.


1150
01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:09.550
Maybe you should
get a job this summer.


1151
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:11.570
He's already got one.

1152
01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:12.690
He's the lifeguard
at the pool here.


1153
01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:16.490
SUSAN: No, no, I'm serious.
That way you could earn
money toward getting a car.


1154
01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.550
You're getting your license.

1155
01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.590
You're going to need
a car of your own.


1156
01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:23.660
Especially if you're going to
spend your senior year
here in Portland.

BETH: Wait, do you mean that?

1159
01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:28.650
SUSAN: Yeah,
I think David's right.


1160
01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:32.540
The only way for us
to be a proper family
is if you're home with us.


1161
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:35.540
Besides, when you go
to college, you're not
going to come back.


1162
01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:38.480
-Who wants dessert?
SEAN: Oh, me. I do.


1163
01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:41.600
I'm going to drop
Sean and Beth off
at the Kalgan,


1164
01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.750
'cause they're
going to spend the night


1165
01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.710
and then Carrie's mom's
going to drive them up
to camp tomorrow.


1166
01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:47.720
Want to ride with me?
I wish I could.


1167
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:50.630
But I need to get
back on the Internet
and finalize this job.


1168
01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:53.510
Okay. I should only
be a couple hours.


1169
01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:55.510
A couple hours. Okay.

1170
01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:59.530
Well, have fun,
guys, huh?


1171
01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.590

1175
01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:12.640
I love you, too.

1176
01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:39.510
What are your plans
this evening?


1177
01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:40.730
Um...

1178
01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:43.520
I might go see Kelly.

1179
01:16:43.710 --> 01:16:45.520
For how long?

1180
01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.700
I don't know. Why?

1181
01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:49.710
Just be careful.

1182
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:52.690
The news said
there's a big storm
headed this way.


1183
01:17:35.710 --> 01:17:36.740
It's gone.

1184
01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:39.520
What?
The shot I took
of him before?


1185
01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:42.480
It's gone. He deleted it
and now there's no pictures
of him anywhere.


1186
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:44.680
Well, maybe you
deleted it by accident.
No, I didn't...


1187
01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:46.480
Have you not been
listening to me?


1188
01:17:46.510 --> 01:17:47.750
I thought you said he
didn't see you take it.


1189
01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.660
Maybe he did or
maybe he's been


1190
01:17:49.690 --> 01:17:51.480
checking my phone
this whole time.
I don't know.


1191
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:53.540
But he came
into my room when
I was in the shower.


1192
01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:56.490
He deleted it.
I know he did.


1193
01:17:56.530 --> 01:17:57.740
He doesn't want
his picture taken.


1194
01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.740
That doesn't mean
he's a killer.


1195
01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:05.600
The key to the basement
didn't just get lost,


1196
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:07.680
all right.
He's always down there.


1197
01:18:07.710 --> 01:18:09.620
He's hiding something.

1198
01:18:10.650 --> 01:18:13.540
So what's the weather like?
I'm trying to pack.


1199
01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:16.740
All you're going to need
is a bikini and a smile.


1200
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:18.530
Neither if you
forget the bikini,


1201
01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.620
because it have
enough smile for
both of us.


1202
01:18:20.650 --> 01:18:22.610
Hold on a sec.

1203
01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:24.620
Are you on your cell phone?

1204
01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:25.690
Hey. This is Susan.
Leave me a message...


1205
01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:28.590
If you're trying to do
some last-minute business,
give it a rest.


1206
01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:29.760
You've got a plane to
catch in three hours.


1207
01:18:30.490 --> 01:18:31.730
No, I'm trying
to reach Susan.


1208
01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:34.510
I think I did
something stupid.


1209
01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:37.630
I called Jay
and I left a message
that I wanted him


1210
01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:39.590
to do a background
check on David.


1211
01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:41.660
You think you did
something stupid?


1212
01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:45.690
Listen,
I called him about the W-2s
and he hung up on me.


1213
01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:48.700
He never did anything
he said that he would.


1214
01:18:48.730 --> 01:18:50.650
She is going to kill you.

1215
01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:53.560
I know. That's why
I need to reach her


1216
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:55.650
before Jay gets to her first.
Okay?


1217
01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:59.760
So, please, do me a favour.
I will call you during my
Layover in L.A., okay?


1218

01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:12.610
Yep. Aisle two.
You're welcome.


1379
01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:14.740
Andy, Ross,
where'd you go?


1380
01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:19.500
Guys?

1381
01:37:20.490 --> 01:37:23.580
Hey, hey, guys, come on!
Knock it off!
Get back over here!


1382
01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:27.630
Come on, guys,
wait for me.


1383
01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:32.660
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Guys, come on. Let's go.


1384
01:37:32.690 --> 01:37:35.730
That's okay.
You know what they say,
boys will be boys.


1385
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:39.550
Do you have any children?

1386
01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:41.760
I lost my wife and
daughter in a car accident.


1387
01:37:42.490 --> 01:37:44.660
I'm sorry.
No, that's okay.


1388
01:37:44.690 --> 01:37:46.480
It's been nearly
a year now.


1389
01:37:46.510 --> 01:37:47.630
I kind of know what
you're going through.


1390
01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:49.720
I lost my husband
two years ago.


1391
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:52.740
I know it's hard sometimes,
but it does get easier.


1392
01:37:53.470 --> 01:37:54.570
I hope so.

1393
01:37:55.660 --> 01:37:57.650
Hey, I'm Chris Ames.

1394
01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:59.660
I'm Julie King.
Nice to meet you.


1395
01:37:59.690 --> 01:38:00.720
Well, it's nice
to meet you.


1396
01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:05.610

01:38:48.610 --> 01:38:50.750

01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:55.530
## The only one for me is you

1409
01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:57.750
