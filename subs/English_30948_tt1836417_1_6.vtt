00:00:22.476 --> 00:00:23.910
Bridget, did you finish

2
00:00:23.944 --> 00:00:25.977
making the strawberry
preserves last night?


3
00:00:25.978 --> 00:00:27.245
Because I can't find them.

4
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.347
Yeah, I put them
in the back of the tr--


5
00:00:31.317 --> 00:00:35.487
They're at home. I'm sorry, dad.
I totally forgot.


6
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:37.722
Um...I can go over
to Green Catering.


7
00:00:37.757 --> 00:00:39.157
Ani usually has jam.

8
00:00:39.191 --> 00:00:41.393
It's not homemade, and we're not
talking to those people.


9
00:00:41.427 --> 00:00:44.429
Now, I need you to drive
back to the house and get it.


10
00:00:44.463 --> 00:00:46.298
You have a beef
with everybody.


11
00:00:46.332 --> 00:00:49.334
And it's gonna take me a couple
of hours to get home and back.


12
00:00:49.368 --> 00:00:51.102
Well, then,
you'd better get going.


13
00:01:11.357 --> 00:01:14.159
Hey.
How we doin', huh?


14
00:01:14.193 --> 00:01:16.027
The other day, right?

15
00:01:16.062 --> 00:01:17.395
Oh, boy.

16
00:01:19.098 --> 00:01:21.232
Nick! Leo! Daylight's burning,
guys. Come on.


17
00:01:21.267 --> 00:01:23.034
Oh, hi, sweetie.
Sit down for breakfast.


18
00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:24.436
- Morning.
- Hi, Davey.


19
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.304
Why do we always
have to have


20
00:01:26.339 --> 00:01:27.973
breakfast food
for breakfast?


21
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:29.908
I don't know.
Because it's just...


22
00:01:29.942 --> 00:01:32.043
I don't know.
No reason, I guess. No --


23
00:01:32.078 --> 00:01:33.511
What are you thinking, Leo?

24
00:01:33.546 --> 00:01:34.879
Grilled cheese sandwich.

25
00:01:34.914 --> 00:01:36.047
How about a quesadilla?

26
00:01:36.082 --> 00:01:37.616
No, no, no.
I made him waffles.


27
00:01:39.452 --> 00:01:41.453
Problem solved.

28
00:01:44.256 --> 00:01:46.091
Could you make it
with extra cheese?


29
00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:47.492
Sure.

30
00:01:50.796 --> 00:01:52.197
Oh, hi.
Hi. Hi. Come on in.


31
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:53.898
- I've got --
- Good morning.


32
00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:55.767
- It's the big day.
- Oh. What?


33
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:57.469
It's our online auction
for the school.


34
00:01:57.503 --> 00:01:59.404
Oh.
Right. Right. Right.


35
00:01:59.438 --> 00:02:02.440
Your brother is amazing.
He built the entire website.


36
00:02:02.475 --> 00:02:04.309
And we go live today
at noon.


37
00:02:04.343 --> 00:02:06.878
So much better than last year.
Do you know Joanne Dunlop?


38
00:02:06.912 --> 00:02:09.126
The white house on the corner
with the roses to die for?


39
00:02:09.127 --> 00:02:09.894
No. I --

40
00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.878
well, she's great,
but she still has dial-up.


41
00:02:12.118 --> 00:02:14.452
It took us all weekend
to get everything online.


42
00:02:14.487 --> 00:02:15.854
Oh, and, by the way,
thank you


43
00:02:15.888 --> 00:02:18.223
for those LAPD items
that you donated.


44
00:02:18.257 --> 00:02:19.275
I think people are gonna be
really excited.


45
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.480
Oh, great.
Well, you know what?


46
00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:21.815
I'd do anything I can
for the school.


47
00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.350
Hey, Katie.
Hey.


48
00:02:23.384 --> 00:02:25.519
Hey, you want a latte?
Glo is an awesome barista.


49
00:02:25.553 --> 00:02:27.045
Ooh, if it's not
too much trouble.


50
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.854
No, no, no, no, no.

51
00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:30.324
It just takes a couple of
minutes, and they are delicious.


52
00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:32.593
- Right, Glo?
- Right. Right.


53
00:02:32.627 --> 00:02:34.061
Is there anything
you can't do?


54
00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:37.965
Get out the front door.

55
00:02:42.737 --> 00:02:45.539
Hey!
This truck's on fire!


56
00:02:50.778 --> 00:02:51.912
Is anybody in there?

57
00:02:51.946 --> 00:02:53.780
I don't know.
Call 911.

60
00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:25.179
- Quit looking at me  like that.
- Like what?


61
00:03:25.213 --> 00:03:26.295
Every time we catch a case
with fire,


62
00:03:26.296 --> 00:03:27.396
you treat me like glass.

63
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:29.331
- No, I don't.
- Little bit.


64
00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:31.467
- All right. I'm trying to be sensitive.
- Yeah, well, don't.


65
00:03:31.501 --> 00:03:33.202
What happened to me
happened a long time ago.


66
00:03:33.236 --> 00:03:34.837
No one died, and I am fine.

67
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:37.540
For somebody who says they're
fine, you sure don't sound fine.


68
00:03:37.574 --> 00:03:39.008
No, it's not that.

69
00:03:39.042 --> 00:03:40.476
It's my brother just
drove me crazy this morning.


70
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.445
Morning, detectives.
Looks like a grease fire.


71
00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.447
- How many D.B.'s?
- Just one. Male.


72
00:03:44.481 --> 00:03:46.460
We think it's the truck's owner,
Roderick Wilson.


73
00:03:46.485 --> 00:03:47.156
Excuse me.

74
00:03:47.157 --> 00:03:49.192
Gonna take a while
to process the scene.


75
00:03:49.286 --> 00:03:52.221
The victim suffered
blunt-force trauma to the head.


76
00:03:52.255 --> 00:03:55.257
Autopsy will tell us
if he got beaned before the fire


77
00:03:55.292 --> 00:03:57.326
or just passed out and fell
as a result of the smoke.


78
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.761
Well, this skillet over here

79
00:03:58.795 --> 00:04:01.030
kind of suggests
option number one, doesn't it?


80
00:04:01.064 --> 00:04:03.399
Somebody probably came in,
they had a fight,


81
00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:04.934
whacked the victim
over the head,


82
00:04:04.968 --> 00:04:07.436
and then set the fire
to cover everything up.


83
00:04:07.471 --> 00:04:08.671
That's some angry guy.

84
00:04:08.705 --> 00:04:10.406
Well, maybe there was history,
you know?


85
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.641
Bad blood so that it didn't
take much to go from 0 to 10.


86
00:04:12.676 --> 00:04:14.343
Morning, detectives.

87
00:04:14.377 --> 00:04:16.912
The gentleman getting treated
was the first to the scene.


88
00:04:16.947 --> 00:04:18.714
Didn't see anyone
enter or exit the truck.


89
00:04:18.748 --> 00:04:20.483
Hmm. Other witnesses?

90
00:04:20.517 --> 00:04:23.752
Ah, we're still canvassing,
but those two both saw the fire.


91
00:04:23.787 --> 00:04:26.249
The guy in the hoodie
manages that surf shop.


92
00:04:26.274 --> 00:04:27.474
Seems kind of stoned.

93
00:04:27.624 --> 00:04:29.258
The other guy,
Angus Jenner,


94
00:04:29.292 --> 00:04:31.727
owns the restaurant
behind the truck.


95
00:04:31.761 --> 00:04:32.895
I can't tell
if he's hiding something


96
00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:33.829
or if he's
just an asshole.


97
00:04:34.898 --> 00:04:36.365
Where are
the other trucks?


98
00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:37.900
Split soon as
they heard sirens.


99
00:04:37.934 --> 00:04:40.336
That's weird that they didn't
stick around, isn't it?


100
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.906
Yeah. I did get the names
of the ones that were here --


101
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.075
Green Truck Catering,
Hotlinks Heaven,


102
00:04:46.109 --> 00:04:48.844
Tyler's Rolling Diner,
and the Lardon Truck.


103
00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:50.379
They're all about bacon.

104
00:04:50.413 --> 00:04:52.515
Well, everything
is better with bacon.


105
00:04:52.549 --> 00:04:54.750
No! No!

106
00:04:54.784 --> 00:04:56.519
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.


107
00:04:56.553 --> 00:04:57.853
It's okay. Okay. Okay.

108
00:04:57.888 --> 00:04:59.855
Is that --
is that my dad?


109
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.790
- Is this your truck?
-  Yes.


110
00:05:01.825 --> 00:05:03.425
No one has been
identified yet.


111
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.361
Is that my dad in there?

112
00:05:05.395 --> 00:05:06.495
If it is, just tell me.

113
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.496
Please.

114
00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:09.532
Where are
the other trucks?


115
00:05:09.566 --> 00:05:10.633
They left.

116
00:05:10.667 --> 00:05:12.034
- They left?!
- Yeah, it's okay.


117
00:05:12.068 --> 00:05:13.903
Our truck was on fire
and they all left?


118
00:05:13.937 --> 00:05:15.804
- Everybody?
- What is your name?


119
00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:17.373
Bridget.

120
00:05:17.407 --> 00:05:19.508
Bridget, do you have any family
that I can call?


121
00:05:19.543 --> 00:05:21.877
No. There was just
me and my dad.


122
00:05:21.912 --> 00:05:24.046
Okay. All right.
You know what?


123
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.282
We're gonna take you downtown,
sweetie. All right?


124
00:05:26.316 --> 00:05:27.850
We're gonna take care
of you, okay?


125
00:05:27.884 --> 00:05:29.418
Hey, Buerge,
could you do me a favor?


126
00:05:29.452 --> 00:05:31.520
Can you get those witnesses
over to RHD, please?


127
00:05:31.555 --> 00:05:33.255
- Wait, I just need to see --
- No, no, no, no, no, no.


128
00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:42.249
I was in the kitchen, working,
and one of my waiters came in,


129
00:05:42.283 --> 00:05:43.584
said he saw
a bunch of smoke outside,


130
00:05:43.618 --> 00:05:45.452
so I ran out
of the restaurant to see.


131
00:05:45.486 --> 00:05:48.655
And when you saw that the truck
was on fire, what did you do?


132
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.991
I don't understand
the question.


133
00:05:51.025 --> 00:05:52.826
Uh, you know,
did you try to help?


134
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.862
You mean stick my head
inside a burning truck? No.


135
00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.764
Why should I risk my neck

136
00:05:57.799 --> 00:05:59.933
for some dirtbag who's
peeling away my business?


137
00:05:59.968 --> 00:06:02.669
Maybe we should have a little
respect for the dead, you know?


138
00:06:02.704 --> 00:06:03.904
Yeah? Those trucks
don't respect each other.


139
00:06:03.938 --> 00:06:05.639
You should have seen it.

140
00:06:05.673 --> 00:06:07.774
The whole pack of them --
they just scurried away


141
00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:09.343
when they heard
the sirens.


142
00:06:09.377 --> 00:06:10.944
If they're not gonna be loyal
to their own kind,


143
00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:13.013
why the hell
should I help?


144
00:06:13.047 --> 00:06:15.616
Man, I hope
they come back.


145
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.651
I get to eat food
from all over the world


146
00:06:17.685 --> 00:06:19.019
without ever
leaving my block.


147
00:06:19.053 --> 00:06:20.520
And there's
this one truck,


148
00:06:20.555 --> 00:06:23.824
makes this bomb vegan noodle
bowl I love for breakfast.


149
00:06:23.858 --> 00:06:24.825
Yeah.

150
00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:26.293
Detective Buerge told me

151
00:06:26.327 --> 00:06:27.961
you saw someone
leave the burned truck


152
00:06:27.996 --> 00:06:29.830
just a couple of minutes
before the fire broke out.


153
00:06:29.864 --> 00:06:31.064
Did you get a good look?

154
00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.567
Not real good.
It was just some dude.


155
00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:36.737
Can you
be more specific?


156
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.905
Yeah. It was a guy.

157
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.675
Okay.
So the dude was a guy?


158
00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:42.976
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


159
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:44.911
Was he white?
Was he black?


160
00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:46.413
He wasn't black.

161
00:06:46.447 --> 00:06:47.581
Was he white?

162
00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:49.883
He definitely
wasn't black.


163
00:06:49.917 --> 00:06:51.585
Okay.

164
00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:54.755
How tall would you say
this non-b-b-black man?


165
00:06:56.891 --> 00:06:58.525
I didn't see anyone.

166
00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:01.161
Look, Detective, my restaurant
could have burned down.


167
00:07:01.195 --> 00:07:03.597
These trucks --
they got no regard for anybody.


168
00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:05.132
They park right out front.

169
00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:07.167
They have no overhead
except change for the meters.


170
00:07:07.201 --> 00:07:10.170
They undercut my prices.

171
00:07:10.204 --> 00:07:12.839
I'm the head of the local
restaurant association,


172
00:07:12.874 --> 00:07:15.199
and I've been battling these people
in court for over two years now.


173
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.900
My witness saw
a man leaving the truck


174
00:07:16.935 --> 00:07:18.302
a few minutes
before the fire.


175
00:07:18.336 --> 00:07:19.803
Could he make an I.D.?

176
00:07:19.837 --> 00:07:22.439
Non-black,

177
00:07:22.473 --> 00:07:24.575
normal build,
indeterminate height.


178
00:07:24.609 --> 00:07:26.577
So, could be mini-me,
could be André the Giant.


179
00:07:26.611 --> 00:07:28.412
Only thing I know for sure
is the witness


180
00:07:28.446 --> 00:07:30.480
makes good use out of
his medical marijuana card.


181
00:07:30.515 --> 00:07:32.282
Yeah, well, I'm gonna go
check on the girl


182
00:07:32.317 --> 00:07:33.684
and see if she's okay.
All right.


183
00:07:35.753 --> 00:07:37.721
Vanilla?

184
00:07:37.755 --> 00:07:39.523
Really, L.T.?

185
00:07:39.557 --> 00:07:43.327
Oh, sometimes I like to stick
a little umbrella in my beer.


186
00:07:43.361 --> 00:07:46.129
I don't want
to play with you right now.


187
00:07:46.164 --> 00:07:48.532
All righty, then.
I'll cut to the chase.


188
00:07:48.566 --> 00:07:51.034
Coroner's prelim
on the food truck victim --


189
00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:52.436
no smoke in the lungs.

190
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:53.971
So he was dead
before the fire.


191
00:07:54.005 --> 00:07:54.938
Yeah.

192
00:07:54.973 --> 00:07:56.673
How's the girl doing?

193
00:07:56.708 --> 00:07:58.609
She's better --
she's in the conference room


194
00:07:58.643 --> 00:08:00.010
with someone
from social services.


195
00:08:00.044 --> 00:08:01.545
I was just
telling the L.T.,


196
00:08:01.579 --> 00:08:02.846
no smoke
in Wilson's lungs.


197
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.047
You were right.
It was murder.


198
00:08:04.082 --> 00:08:05.515
Have you
told his daughter yet?


199
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.585
No. No. I-I thought maybe
you'd want to handle that.


200
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.173
I don't have the ovaries.

201
00:08:11.198 --> 00:08:12.398
Sure you do.

202
00:08:19.216 --> 00:08:21.350
Thanks very much.

203
00:08:23.153 --> 00:08:24.387
Bridget.

204
00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:27.623
Do you remember me?
I'm Detective Sheppard.


205
00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:40.254
I'm -- I'm so very sorry
for your loss.


206
00:08:42.023 --> 00:08:45.559
We've learned a little bit
about what happened to your dad,


207
00:08:45.593 --> 00:08:50.364
and we're pretty sure that
the fire wasn't an accident.


208
00:08:50.398 --> 00:08:51.699
It --

209
00:08:51.733 --> 00:08:54.034
he was murdered?

210
00:08:54.069 --> 00:08:56.270
Yeah.

211
00:08:58.673 --> 00:09:01.408
Do you know who did it?

212
00:09:01.443 --> 00:09:04.244
No. I was hoping that you might
be able to help us with that.


213
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.048
Is there anyone
that you can think of


214
00:09:08.083 --> 00:09:11.251
that would want to hurt
your dad?


215
00:09:12.787 --> 00:09:14.855
Did he owe anyone money?

216
00:09:14.889 --> 00:09:16.390
No.

217
00:09:16.424 --> 00:09:20.327
My dad didn't believe in...
Borrowing anything.


218
00:09:20.362 --> 00:09:23.764
We own the house
and trucks outright.


219
00:09:23.798 --> 00:09:27.368
Did he...burn to death?

220
00:09:27.402 --> 00:09:29.603
That would be really awful
if he died in a fire.


221
00:09:29.637 --> 00:09:31.839
No, sweetie. No.

222
00:09:31.873 --> 00:09:33.841
We know for a fact
that your father was gone


223
00:09:33.875 --> 00:09:35.009
before the blaze was set.

224
00:09:36.745 --> 00:09:40.280
Bridget, you said something
when you were out on the street.


225
00:09:40.315 --> 00:09:42.082
It seemed like
you were surprised


226
00:09:42.117 --> 00:09:44.385
that the other trucks
had just driven away.


227
00:09:44.419 --> 00:09:47.821
Now, I thought that
that was odd, too.


228
00:09:47.856 --> 00:09:50.290
Was there
someone in particular


229
00:09:50.325 --> 00:09:52.960
t-that you
expected to stay, or...


230
00:09:54.329 --> 00:09:57.064
No. I...

231
00:09:57.098 --> 00:09:59.666
I was just surprised
that the other trucks


232
00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:00.868
didn't stay to help.

233
00:10:04.439 --> 00:10:06.273
Can I go now?

234
00:10:06.307 --> 00:10:07.474
Are you sure you're ready?

235
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:08.575
Yeah.

236
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.811
All right,
I'll have Officer Cooper


237
00:10:10.845 --> 00:10:12.346
give you a ride home.

238
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.948
No, I just -- I just need a ride
back to my truck.


239
00:10:14.983 --> 00:10:16.183
Okay.

240
00:10:18.219 --> 00:10:21.388
Whoever did this to my dad
is gonna have to pay.


241
00:10:22.757 --> 00:10:26.393
Absolutely.
We'll do everything that we can.


242
00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:33.156
Hey.

243
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:34.724
A couple uniforms

244
00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:37.527
are taking Bridget Wilson
back to her truck.


245
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:39.062
I don't know --
I just wish


246
00:10:39.096 --> 00:10:41.164
there was more we could do
for her right now, you know?


247
00:10:41.198 --> 00:10:42.632
This might help a bit.

248
00:10:42.667 --> 00:10:45.936
Last month, Rod Wilson
filed a police report


249
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.204
against that restaurant owner,
Angus Jenner.


250
00:10:48.239 --> 00:10:51.007
That explains why Jenner was
so nasty when I talked to him.


251
00:10:51.042 --> 00:10:53.576
Wilson claims Jenner took
a baseball bat to his truck.


252
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.278
Smashed it up pretty good --

253
00:10:55.313 --> 00:10:56.980
cost him a couple of grand
in repairs.


254
00:10:57.014 --> 00:10:58.581
Well, Jenner told me

255
00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:00.517
that he'd been battling
the food trucks for years.


256
00:11:00.551 --> 00:11:03.286
I just had no idea
he meant battling with bats.


257
00:11:03.321 --> 00:11:04.754
Let's get him
back in here, yeah?


258
00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:06.089
Yeah.

259
00:11:07.191 --> 00:11:09.693
There's some
pretty cool stuff here.


260
00:11:09.727 --> 00:11:11.795
Horseback riding
on Catalina.


261
00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:13.863
That cabin in Mammoth's
already up to 300 bucks.


262
00:11:13.898 --> 00:11:16.132
Oh, every year that's
one of our highest draws.


263
00:11:16.167 --> 00:11:18.268
Free dental cleaning,
free tax returns.


264
00:11:18.302 --> 00:11:19.703
Yeah,
a lot of the parents


265
00:11:19.737 --> 00:11:21.338
donate their
professional services.


266
00:11:21.372 --> 00:11:22.405
What does your husband do?

267
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.140
He's a proctologist.

268
00:11:24.175 --> 00:11:25.175
I'm baking cookies.

269
00:11:25.209 --> 00:11:26.977
Ahh.

270
00:11:27.011 --> 00:11:29.546
All right, let's see how
Gloria's LAPD stuff is doing.


271
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.147
5 bucks, 10 bucks.
That's like nothing.


272
00:11:31.182 --> 00:11:32.849
Well, it's early.

273
00:11:32.883 --> 00:11:35.118
Even if somebody was
dying for an LAPD T-shirt,


274
00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:36.953
no one's even gonna bid

275
00:11:38.022 --> 00:11:40.090
You know an even cooler
LAPD thing?


276
00:11:40.124 --> 00:11:41.391
Shooting guns?

277
00:11:41.425 --> 00:11:42.726
Uh

278
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.161
Yes, but also
riding in a cop car.


279
00:11:45.196 --> 00:11:46.763
With Gloria?

280
00:11:46.797 --> 00:11:48.732
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They call it a ride-along.


281
00:11:48.766 --> 00:11:51.301
Would she do that?
That -- that would be amazing.


282
00:11:51.335 --> 00:11:53.803
For the kids' school?
Absolutely.


283
00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:57.340
It sounds exciting. I think
people are gonna love that.


284
00:11:57.375 --> 00:11:59.476
Why am I back here?
I already told you my alibi.


285
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.878
I was doing prep work
in the restaurant.


286
00:12:01.912 --> 00:12:04.080
Yeah, but your restaurant is less
than 20 yards from the truck,


287
00:12:04.115 --> 00:12:06.516
so that's like saying your alibi is
that you were at the crime scene.


288
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.019
Can't be that hard
to disappear for five minutes.


289
00:12:09.053 --> 00:12:11.121
Maybe you had an argument
with Rod Wilson, huh?


290
00:12:11.155 --> 00:12:12.422
Maybe --
maybe you wanted him


291
00:12:12.456 --> 00:12:14.157
to move his truck
and he wouldn't.


292
00:12:14.191 --> 00:12:15.759
Oh, wait,
so you're suggesting


293
00:12:15.793 --> 00:12:17.894
that I killed this guy
in front of my restaurant?


294
00:12:17.928 --> 00:12:19.696
Oh, I see.
How is that good for business?


295
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.331
If it keeps the other trucks
from coming back,


296
00:12:21.365 --> 00:12:23.233
it'd be great for business.

297
00:12:23.267 --> 00:12:25.568
What part of "I didn't do it"
is so unclear?


298
00:12:25.603 --> 00:12:27.404
The part where you
failed to mention


299
00:12:27.438 --> 00:12:28.872
that the victim,
Rod Wilson,


300
00:12:28.906 --> 00:12:30.473
filed a police report
against you


301
00:12:30.508 --> 00:12:32.208
for taking a bat
to his truck.


302
00:12:32.243 --> 00:12:34.677
I didn't mention that
because I didn't do it.


303
00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:37.680
Were there any charges
filed against me? No.


304
00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:40.617
Has anyone ever
linked me to this? No.


305
00:12:40.651 --> 00:12:43.920
Look, this Wilson guy -- he
didn't just come after me, okay?


306
00:12:43.954 --> 00:12:46.956
He got into a fight with
half the trucks on the street.


307
00:12:46.991 --> 00:12:49.459
And yet you're the only one
he named in the report.


308
00:12:49.493 --> 00:12:53.196
Ask around. You're gonna see.
The whole thing's a joke.


309
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.631
Can I go now?

310
00:12:54.665 --> 00:12:58.435
We're gonna need
the names of your employees


311
00:12:58.469 --> 00:13:00.236
who can provide you
with an alibi.


312
00:13:01.705 --> 00:13:03.940
You want to know
the biggest joke --


313
00:13:03.974 --> 00:13:07.343
magazines keep saying
that, uh, truck food is so chic.


314
00:13:07.378 --> 00:13:08.611
Tell me what's so chic

315
00:13:08.646 --> 00:13:11.047
about eating food on the curb,
like a bum.


316
00:13:12.483 --> 00:13:14.484
Guy practically
came out swinging at "Hello."


317
00:13:14.518 --> 00:13:16.219
We need to look real hard
at his alibi.


318
00:13:16.253 --> 00:13:18.354
He's got a temper and a history
with the victim.


319
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:20.090
Yeah, we should also see
if he's right


320
00:13:20.124 --> 00:13:22.025
about Wilson fighting
with the other trucks.


321
00:13:22.059 --> 00:13:24.227
You know, I looked online,
and a lot of them park


322
00:13:24.261 --> 00:13:26.062
across from the county museum
around noon.


323
00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:28.364
What do you say we make it
a working lunch?
Mmm.


324
00:13:34.071 --> 00:13:36.005
Got a sec?

325
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.141
Yeah, sure.

326
00:13:38.175 --> 00:13:41.244
Is this work,
or is this personal?


327
00:13:41.278 --> 00:13:42.445
Like really personal.

328
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.580
Oh.

329
00:13:43.614 --> 00:13:46.015
You sure
you want to do this?


330
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:46.983
Uh, no.

331
00:13:47.017 --> 00:13:48.318
No, I'm not, um,

332
00:13:48.352 --> 00:13:50.320
but I -- I don't know
who else to talk to,


333
00:13:50.354 --> 00:13:53.456
and you're, like, the closest
thing I have to a dad.


334
00:13:53.491 --> 00:13:55.091
So I had you
when I was 10.


335
00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:56.993
That's --
that's not wha--


336
00:13:57.027 --> 00:13:58.128
that's not what I meant.

337
00:13:58.162 --> 00:13:59.195
Um...

338
00:14:00.364 --> 00:14:01.931
I just need to talk.

339
00:14:04.602 --> 00:14:08.972
I've been...Going out
with this girl, Angie,


340
00:14:09.006 --> 00:14:11.474
uh, for about a year now,
and we're really good


341
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:14.077
about keeping a handle
on this kind of stuff.


342
00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:16.012
Mm-hmm.

343
00:14:16.046 --> 00:14:18.248
Uh...S-she took
a home pregnancy test --


344
00:14:18.282 --> 00:14:19.315
Oh.

345
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.184
Yeah. Positive.

346
00:14:21.218 --> 00:14:22.552
I just found out.

347
00:14:22.586 --> 00:14:24.354
So you're freaking out.

348
00:14:24.388 --> 00:14:27.991
My heart is slamming
in my chest,


349
00:14:28.025 --> 00:14:29.626
and I can't feel
my legs.


350
00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.427
How does Angie feel
about this?


351
00:14:31.462 --> 00:14:33.563
I don't know. No idea.

352
00:14:33.597 --> 00:14:34.931
You didn't ask her?

353
00:14:34.965 --> 00:14:36.432
No, I'm not good at that.

354
00:14:36.467 --> 00:14:38.434
So you're
asking me instead?


355
00:14:38.469 --> 00:14:40.103
You have kids, right?

356
00:14:40.137 --> 00:14:42.272
Yeah.
A boy and a girl.


357
00:14:42.306 --> 00:14:44.307
And...Do you like
being a dad?


358
00:14:45.543 --> 00:14:46.976
Well, yeah.

359
00:14:48.245 --> 00:14:51.981
Look, it's the only part
of my life that isn't overrated.


360
00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:55.885
You know, money
and relationships and career


361
00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.454
can still leave you empty,
you know,


362
00:14:58.489 --> 00:15:00.957
but my kids
and being their dad...


363
00:15:02.593 --> 00:15:04.761
...Is pretty amazing.

364
00:15:06.597 --> 00:15:09.199
And you're gonna be fine.

365
00:15:10.467 --> 00:15:12.969
Now get back to work.

366
00:15:26.383 --> 00:15:28.284
Let's start
by talking to the trucks


367
00:15:28.319 --> 00:15:30.386
that were at Abbot Kinney
this morning.


368
00:15:30.421 --> 00:15:32.422
Oh, my God.
Do you smell that barbecue?


369
00:15:32.456 --> 00:15:34.324
Yes, and it smells
delicious, too.


370
00:15:34.358 --> 00:15:37.427
Too bad there weren't any barbecue
trucks at the crime scene.


371
00:15:37.461 --> 00:15:40.730
That doesn't mean we can't ask
them a few pertinent questions.


372
00:15:40.764 --> 00:15:42.665
It is the lunch hour.

373
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.602
Well, in that case, I'm gonna go
interrogate the Cajun truck.


374
00:15:45.636 --> 00:15:47.971
I will see you
in a minute.


375
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.175
Everyone's pretty freaked.

376
00:15:52.209 --> 00:15:53.610
Well, if everyone
is so freaked,


377
00:15:53.644 --> 00:15:55.178
how come no one
helped Rod Wilson?


378
00:15:55.212 --> 00:15:57.614
And do what?
Flames were everywhere.


379
00:15:57.648 --> 00:16:00.617
Once I saw the fire trucks,
I packed it in. We all did.


380
00:16:00.651 --> 00:16:02.218
There was nothing else
to do.


381
00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:03.419
So you just left?

382
00:16:03.454 --> 00:16:05.221
What can I say?
I liked him.


383
00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:07.657
We went out for a few months,
and then one day,


384
00:16:07.691 --> 00:16:09.993
Rod saw me talking to
another guy -- just talking.


385
00:16:10.027 --> 00:16:12.028
Cut me off,
wouldn't even let me explain.


386
00:16:12.062 --> 00:16:13.229
So he was jealous.

387
00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:14.697
It was more than that.

388
00:16:14.732 --> 00:16:16.666
It was a loyalty thing.

389
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.335
People were either for him
or against him. In or out.


390
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.938
Other than Bridget,
most people were out.


391
00:16:21.972 --> 00:16:23.773
Do you know who might have
done this to him?


392
00:16:23.807 --> 00:16:26.276
I wish I could help you.

393
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:27.510
Mm.

394
00:16:27.544 --> 00:16:28.945
I was on my truck.

395
00:16:28.979 --> 00:16:30.680
There was nothing
I could really do, you know?


396
00:16:30.714 --> 00:16:33.716
That girl's his daughter, right?
Uh -- uh, what's her name?


397
00:16:33.751 --> 00:16:35.318
Bridget.

398
00:16:35.352 --> 00:16:36.619
That's rough, man.

399
00:16:36.654 --> 00:16:38.521
Losing your dad like that.

400
00:16:38.555 --> 00:16:40.723
Do you know if Rod Wilson
had any problems


401
00:16:40.758 --> 00:16:42.759
with any
of the other trucks?


402
00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:44.260
Yeah, most of us
had run-ins with him.


403
00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:45.595
Tyler,
we need more burgers.


404
00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:47.230
It's just --
just the way he was.


405
00:16:47.264 --> 00:16:50.066
Hey, uh, my cook's getting
crushed and I'm losing business.


406
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.768
- Can we talk later?
- Uh, yeah.


407
00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:54.504
Sorry.
Nobody comes to mind.


408
00:16:54.538 --> 00:16:57.173
Look, this is a chance
for you to do the right thing.


409
00:16:57.207 --> 00:17:00.777
I feel bad for Bridget,
but I-I've got nothing to say.


410
00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:03.513
- If you know something --
- I don't.


411
00:17:03.547 --> 00:17:05.315
Ask someone else.

412
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.287
Hey.

413
00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:13.156
Hi.

414
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.258
I've got alibis from all
the drivers that I talked to,


415
00:17:15.292 --> 00:17:17.026
but most of them
had to work pretty hard


416
00:17:17.061 --> 00:17:19.195
to find something nice
to say about the victim.


417
00:17:19.229 --> 00:17:21.297
Yeah, there isn't a whole lot
of love lost, is there?


418
00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:22.799
That's probably
part of the reason


419
00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:24.500
why no one helped him out
this morning.


420
00:17:24.535 --> 00:17:25.902
But you know what?

421
00:17:25.936 --> 00:17:27.337
I feel like there's something
deeper going on.


422
00:17:27.371 --> 00:17:29.839
I mean, a lot of these folks
just seem afraid


423
00:17:29.873 --> 00:17:32.675
of someone or,
I don't know, something else.


424
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:34.110
- I felt that too.
- Yeah.


425
00:17:35.612 --> 00:17:39.315
You know, one of the trucks
from this morning is missing.


426
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.150
Hotlinks Heaven.

427
00:17:42.586 --> 00:17:44.854
You were right.
These are fantastic.


428
00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:49.792
Hey, Tyler, what can you tell me
about Hotlinks Heaven?


429
00:17:49.827 --> 00:17:51.461
Not much.
They sell hot dogs.


430
00:17:51.495 --> 00:17:53.196
You can follow him
on Twitter.


431
00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.597
Twitter?
For a hot dog?


432
00:17:54.631 --> 00:17:55.598
Mm.
Guy's making a killing.


433
00:17:55.632 --> 00:17:57.066
Who is this guy?

434
00:17:57.101 --> 00:18:00.169
Everybody calls him
"Joey Hotlinks."


435
00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:02.438
Is there some reason
that this Joey Hotlinks


436
00:18:02.473 --> 00:18:04.440
wouldn't be around here
this afternoon?


437
00:18:05.776 --> 00:18:08.311
Did he have any issues
with Rod Wilson?


438
00:18:08.345 --> 00:18:10.713
He have any issues
with anybody?


439
00:18:10.748 --> 00:18:13.616
Listen -- a lot of these
drivers seem spooked.


440
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.552
Is Joey Hotlinks
the reason that they're scared?


441
00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:20.323
Joey's been
trying to unionize the trucks


442
00:18:20.357 --> 00:18:21.691
for the past few months.

443
00:18:21.725 --> 00:18:24.360
Okay, a lot of these idiots
have already signed up.


444
00:18:25.796 --> 00:18:27.663
Unionize --
you mean a protection racket?


445
00:18:27.698 --> 00:18:28.898
Hey, I didn't say that.

446
00:18:28.932 --> 00:18:30.500
Yeah, well,
I can do the math.


447
00:18:30.534 --> 00:18:32.869
That would explain
why everybody's scared.


448
00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:35.171
Detective,
the guy's a thug.


449
00:18:35.205 --> 00:18:36.939
Okay, he wants 20%
straight off the top.


450
00:18:36.974 --> 00:18:39.475
And last time I said no, I
ended up with two slashed tires.


451
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.210
What about Rod Wilson?
Did he sign up


452
00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:43.112
Oh, no. Rod hated Joey Hotlinks
more than I do.


453
00:18:43.147 --> 00:18:44.814
And they went at each other
a few weeks back.


454
00:18:44.848 --> 00:18:46.883
Most of us saw the fight.

455
00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:50.219
Yeah, Rod gave him a black eye
and cracked a rib.


456
00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:52.355
Joey was --
he was plenty pissed.


457
00:18:54.005 --> 00:18:55.905
His name is Joey Hotlinks?

458
00:18:55.929 --> 00:18:57.329
I know, right?

459
00:18:57.363 --> 00:18:58.997
He was trying to squeeze
protection money


460
00:18:59.032 --> 00:19:00.699
out of the other
truck owners.


461
00:19:00.733 --> 00:19:03.168
When people turn him down,
bad things happen.


462
00:19:03.203 --> 00:19:05.204
Did Rod Wilson
turn him down?


463
00:19:05.238 --> 00:19:07.873
With both fists,
in front of a lot of people.


464
00:19:07.907 --> 00:19:09.541
Maybe that fire
was payback.


465
00:19:09.576 --> 00:19:11.476
I'm not sure,
but it sounds like


466
00:19:11.511 --> 00:19:14.046
this Hotlinks guy
doesn't take no for an answer.


467
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.981
We're gonna have to
bring him in.


468
00:19:16.015 --> 00:19:18.517
Hey, you got to try this.
You know that?


469
00:19:18.551 --> 00:19:20.118
Watch.
It's really good.


470
00:19:20.153 --> 00:19:22.120
What is this?!

471
00:19:22.155 --> 00:19:23.088
Amazing, right?

472
00:19:23.122 --> 00:19:24.723
- Is this bacon?
- Yeah.


473
00:19:24.757 --> 00:19:26.525
It's got candied bacon
on top


474
00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:28.660
and smoked bacon
in the hot fudge.


475
00:19:28.695 --> 00:19:29.828
Why?

476
00:19:29.863 --> 00:19:31.630
We got to go
back there, okay?


477
00:19:31.664 --> 00:19:33.165
That bacon bus
also sells


478
00:19:33.199 --> 00:19:37.469
a deep-fried cupcake
that sounds out of this world.


479
00:19:37.648 --> 00:19:40.851
Why does he
call himself Joey Hotlinks?


480
00:19:40.885 --> 00:19:42.753
It's like a parody
of a mob nickname.


481
00:19:42.787 --> 00:19:44.688
Like "Johnny Pepperoni."

482
00:19:44.722 --> 00:19:45.989
Or "Benny the Bratwurst."

483
00:19:46.024 --> 00:19:47.424
"Sammy Sausage."

484
00:19:47.458 --> 00:19:48.825
Actually,
Sammy's a real guy.


485
00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.761
Killed his wife,
ground her into sausage,


486
00:19:50.795 --> 00:19:52.429
and fed it
to his in-laws.


487
00:19:52.463 --> 00:19:54.331
- That seems a bit literal.
- Yep.


488
00:19:54.365 --> 00:19:55.899
Now, look,
this Hotlinks guy


489
00:19:55.933 --> 00:19:58.168
may have a goofy name
to push his hot dogs,


490
00:19:58.202 --> 00:20:00.170
but his rap sheet
is plenty scary --


491
00:20:00.204 --> 00:20:01.872
he's got
assault, fraud, arson.


492
00:20:01.906 --> 00:20:03.407
So we like him
for the murder?


493
00:20:03.441 --> 00:20:05.075
He has motive
and opportunity.


494
00:20:05.109 --> 00:20:07.377
He also has a history
of fighting with Wilson.


495
00:20:07.412 --> 00:20:09.846
S.I.D. went through the rubble
in Wilson's truck.


496
00:20:09.881 --> 00:20:12.382
Most everything burned up,
but they did find this medallion


497
00:20:12.417 --> 00:20:13.817
of Michael the Archangel.

498
00:20:13.851 --> 00:20:16.186
Looks like
the clasp is broken.


499
00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.188
Maybe it got ripped off
in the fire.


500
00:20:18.222 --> 00:20:20.090
Oh. Excuse me.

501
00:20:22.126 --> 00:20:23.693
Hey, Davey.

502
00:20:23.728 --> 00:20:25.829
Huge news --
you're a star.


503
00:20:25.863 --> 00:20:27.130
What are you
talking about?


504
00:20:27.165 --> 00:20:28.432
The school auction.

505
00:20:28.466 --> 00:20:31.068
Oh, great. People really like
the hats, huh?


506
00:20:31.102 --> 00:20:33.870
Yeah, but they weren't exactly
big money makers,


507
00:20:33.905 --> 00:20:37.174
so I made an executive decision,
and I added one more item.


508
00:20:37.208 --> 00:20:38.942
We're auctioning off
a ride-along


509
00:20:38.976 --> 00:20:41.478
with RHD Detective
Gloria Sheppard.


510
00:20:41.512 --> 00:20:42.446
What?

511
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.914
Cool, right?

512
00:20:43.948 --> 00:20:45.949
Some parent gets a taste
of the LAPD,


513
00:20:45.983 --> 00:20:48.852
and we raise money
for the school in the process.


514
00:20:48.854 --> 00:20:51.054
The bidding's already
up to 95 bucks.


515
00:20:51.089 --> 00:20:52.222
Make it go away.

516
00:20:52.256 --> 00:20:54.091
- What?
- It's not gonna happen.


517
00:20:54.125 --> 00:20:55.492
But they're
already bidding.


518
00:20:55.526 --> 00:20:58.328
Davey, I'm happy to do
anything I can for the school,


519
00:20:58.362 --> 00:21:00.764
but this was not
yours to do.


520
00:21:00.798 --> 00:21:02.766
Now, just -- just tell them
that you made a mistake.


521
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.867
Look, I got to go.

522
00:21:05.136 --> 00:21:08.405
Buerge put Joey Hotlinks
in interrogation two.


523
00:21:08.439 --> 00:21:10.140
What's wrong with you?

524
00:21:10.174 --> 00:21:11.808
Oh, my stomach hurts.

525
00:21:11.843 --> 00:21:14.544
And my brother just donated
a ride-along with me


526
00:21:14.579 --> 00:21:17.080
for the school auction
without even asking.


527
00:21:17.115 --> 00:21:18.582
People will pay money

528
00:21:18.616 --> 00:21:20.250
to ride in the back
of a police car with you?


529
00:21:20.284 --> 00:21:23.353
I think it's the front, but,
yeah, except I'm not doing it.


530
00:21:23.387 --> 00:21:25.355
You know me.
I can't make small talk.


531
00:21:25.389 --> 00:21:27.691
And in all honesty,
those suburban moms --


532
00:21:27.725 --> 00:21:29.693
they kind of freak me out,
you know?


533
00:21:29.727 --> 00:21:31.294
Hey, can I have
a swig of that?


534
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:33.930
Thanks.

535
00:21:33.965 --> 00:21:37.601
You don't exactly strike me
as a foodie, Mr. Hotlinks.


536
00:21:37.635 --> 00:21:39.736
I came in
through the side door.


537
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.939
My freight business went south.
I got stuck with four trucks.


538
00:21:42.974 --> 00:21:45.909
My cousin likes to grill.
I like hot dogs.


539
00:21:45.943 --> 00:21:47.711
Now I'm in the zeitgeist.

540
00:21:47.745 --> 00:21:49.746
Yeah, but you used to be
in the system.


541
00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.281
Rap sheet
the size of a novel.


542
00:21:51.315 --> 00:21:53.049
Even includes arson.

543
00:21:53.084 --> 00:21:56.753
Youthful indiscretions.
I'm a businessman now.


544
00:21:56.787 --> 00:21:57.988
- Really?
- Yeah.


545
00:21:58.022 --> 00:22:00.223
Sausage salesman
or union organizer?


546
00:22:00.258 --> 00:22:03.126
Listen, the way it is now
for these food truck people,


547
00:22:03.161 --> 00:22:04.361
they're out on their own.

548
00:22:04.395 --> 00:22:06.163
They steal
each other's routes,


549
00:22:06.197 --> 00:22:08.398
the restaurant association
is suing them,


550
00:22:08.432 --> 00:22:10.300
the health board
is on their asses.


551
00:22:10.334 --> 00:22:12.802
If we look out for each other,
everybody wins.


552
00:22:12.837 --> 00:22:15.305
And how much are the dues
in your "union"?


553
00:22:15.339 --> 00:22:16.973
A small percentage.

554
00:22:17.008 --> 00:22:18.074
I heard 20%.

555
00:22:18.109 --> 00:22:19.676
Sounds like
extortion to me.


556
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.379
Hey, you can't put a price
on community.


557
00:22:22.413 --> 00:22:23.847
For someone
talking community,


558
00:22:23.881 --> 00:22:26.116
you sure did take off
pretty fast this morning.


559
00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:27.984
That doesn't mean
I set the fire.


560
00:22:28.019 --> 00:22:31.021
Is that what you and Rod Wilson
fought about a month ago?


561
00:22:31.055 --> 00:22:33.456
Hmm? He didn't want to join
your community?


562
00:22:33.491 --> 00:22:36.993
I liked Rod,
but we had a falling out.


563
00:22:37.028 --> 00:22:37.994
Over what?

564
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:39.496
I really don't know.

565
00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:42.299
One day we're pals, the next day
he takes a swing at me.


566
00:22:42.333 --> 00:22:45.368
After the fight, he sent his daughter,
Bridget, over to tell me


567
00:22:45.403 --> 00:22:47.871
that if I ever talked to him
again, that he'd kill me.


568
00:22:49.173 --> 00:22:50.707
Did you believe him?

569
00:22:50.741 --> 00:22:52.242
Hell, yeah,
I believed him.


570
00:22:52.276 --> 00:22:54.945
If Rod said he was gonna do
something, he was gonna do it.


571
00:22:54.979 --> 00:22:57.847
I've gone out of my way
to avoid him ever since that.


572
00:22:57.882 --> 00:23:00.417
Yeah, but -- but you -- you
parked almost next to him


573
00:23:00.451 --> 00:23:02.052
on Abbott Kinney
this morning.


574
00:23:03.221 --> 00:23:04.988
It's a good place
to sell my dogs.


575
00:23:05.022 --> 00:23:06.957
So you didn't
exchange words with him?


576
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.294
You gonna arrest me,
Detective?


577
00:23:11.329 --> 00:23:13.029
Do I need a lawyer
or what?


578
00:23:13.064 --> 00:23:15.065
Huh?

579
00:23:15.099 --> 00:23:17.567
Either arrest me
or let me go.


580
00:23:17.602 --> 00:23:19.869
Joey Hotlinks admits to
the falling out with Wilson,


581
00:23:19.904 --> 00:23:21.972
but he also said
that Wilson sent his daughter


582
00:23:22.006 --> 00:23:24.007
over to his truck
to threaten him.


583
00:23:24.041 --> 00:23:26.376
Let's take a look at his known
associates, put a little heat on him.


584
00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:27.978
Maybe we can flip
somebody.


585
00:23:28.012 --> 00:23:30.013
I'll start with the drivers
of his other trucks.


586
00:23:30.047 --> 00:23:32.015
I bet most of them
have some sort of record.


587
00:23:32.049 --> 00:23:34.150
I want to go talk
to Bridget Wilson.


588
00:23:34.185 --> 00:23:36.119
I want to hear
what she has to say


589
00:23:36.153 --> 00:23:37.954
about Joey Hotlinks
and her dad.


590
00:23:40.391 --> 00:23:42.292
Wow.

591
00:23:42.326 --> 00:23:43.893
What's up?

592
00:23:43.928 --> 00:23:46.229
I've been checking in
on your school auction.


593
00:23:46.264 --> 00:23:49.766
The bid for the ride-along
just went up to 150 bucks.


594
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.801
What?
Let me see that.


595
00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.507
There.
I just bid $250.


596
00:23:57.541 --> 00:23:59.542
No one in their right mind
is gonna pay more than that.


597
00:23:59.577 --> 00:24:01.444
What is so terrible
about giving a civilian


598
00:24:01.479 --> 00:24:02.479
a taste of what we do?

599
00:24:02.513 --> 00:24:04.014
No, no.
It's not that.


600
00:24:04.048 --> 00:24:05.849
It's just that I wouldn't know
what to say.


601
00:24:05.883 --> 00:24:08.218
I -- I'm more like a guy.
I don't like to chat.


602
00:24:08.252 --> 00:24:10.387
Come on. Let's go
talk to Bridget Wilson.


603
00:24:23.334 --> 00:24:25.535
I wonder why Bridget
wanted us to meet her in here.


604
00:24:25.569 --> 00:24:27.370
Well, I get the feeling
she didn't have


605
00:24:27.405 --> 00:24:28.972
much of a life
apart from her dad.


606
00:24:29.006 --> 00:24:30.340
Maybe these are
his people.


607
00:24:30.374 --> 00:24:32.208
Excuse me. We're looking for
Bridget Wilson.


608
00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:41.251
We're really sorry
to bother you.


609
00:24:41.285 --> 00:24:43.553
It's not like
I have any big plans.


610
00:24:45.022 --> 00:24:47.157
You find out
who killed my dad?


611
00:24:47.191 --> 00:24:50.894
Not yet, but we're
doing everything we can.


612
00:24:50.928 --> 00:24:54.064
Is there someplace else
we could take you


613
00:24:54.098 --> 00:24:57.133
or some friends your own age
you could call?


614
00:24:57.168 --> 00:24:58.168
A boyfriend?

615
00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.072
Um...The house
is too quiet,


616
00:25:02.106 --> 00:25:07.177
and my dad didn't approve...of
the boy I liked, so he's gone.


617
00:25:07.211 --> 00:25:09.045
We spent
a lot of time here.


618
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.481
Most of these folks
are from back home.


619
00:25:11.515 --> 00:25:13.116
Where's that?

620
00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:15.819
Oregon.

621
00:25:15.853 --> 00:25:18.922
Being here makes me
feel connected to my dad,


622
00:25:18.956 --> 00:25:22.492
like he's still
watching over me.


623
00:25:24.428 --> 00:25:27.330
Can you tell me about
your dad and Joey Hotlinks?


624
00:25:28.232 --> 00:25:29.599
You think it was him?

625
00:25:29.633 --> 00:25:32.635
He's one of the people
that we're talking to.


626
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:37.040
Um...My, uh, dad and Joey
used to be pretty tight.


627
00:25:37.074 --> 00:25:39.476
Joey said he didn't know
why your dad cut him off.


628
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.978
It's because
he wasn't loyal.


629
00:25:42.012 --> 00:25:43.847
My dad got in a beef
with the guy


630
00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:46.416
who owned the crepe truck
over a parking spot.


631
00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.385
And when my dad cut him off,

632
00:25:48.419 --> 00:25:51.054
he expected Joey
to do the same.


633
00:25:51.088 --> 00:25:53.523
Joey didn't,
so Joey was out.


634
00:25:53.557 --> 00:25:56.025
That's some
pretty old-school loyalty


635
00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.660
your daddy
was looking for.


636
00:25:57.695 --> 00:25:59.662
That's just
the way we were raised.


637
00:25:59.697 --> 00:26:02.098
You're either loyal
or you're out.


638
00:26:02.133 --> 00:26:06.503
Joey also said that your dad
used you to send a message --


639
00:26:06.537 --> 00:26:08.538
said if Joey
ever talked to him again,


640
00:26:08.572 --> 00:26:10.173
your dad would kill him.

641
00:26:10.207 --> 00:26:11.307
That's true.

642
00:26:11.342 --> 00:26:12.609
So if Joey tried to talk

643
00:26:12.643 --> 00:26:14.444
to your dad
this morning...


644
00:26:14.478 --> 00:26:16.112
That'd be bad
for everybody.


645
00:26:19.417 --> 00:26:23.586
We found this
in your dad's truck.


646
00:26:23.621 --> 00:26:25.755
Do you recognize it?

647
00:26:29.326 --> 00:26:31.127
It was my dad's.

648
00:26:35.666 --> 00:26:38.401
He's really gone.

649
00:26:40.137 --> 00:26:45.909
Listen, if you need anything,
just give me a call.


650
00:26:45.943 --> 00:26:48.378
Even if it's just
to talk, all right?


651
00:26:59.924 --> 00:27:02.091
Hey, guys, I've got
some great stuff for dinner!


652
00:27:02.126 --> 00:27:04.360
I've got -- I've got
noodle bowl and barbecue.


653
00:27:04.395 --> 00:27:06.062
All we have to do
is heat it up.


654
00:27:06.096 --> 00:27:07.363
Hi, mom.
Cool shirt, huh?


655
00:27:07.398 --> 00:27:09.098
Yeah. You think
it's big enough for you?


656
00:27:09.133 --> 00:27:11.134
Go get your brother
for dinner. Mwah!


657
00:27:11.168 --> 00:27:12.735
Hey.

658
00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.071
Hey, Davey, I need to talk
to you about the ride-along.


659
00:27:15.105 --> 00:27:17.106
Oh, I just thought you'd want
to contribute to the school.


660
00:27:17.141 --> 00:27:19.375
Well, actually,
I did contribute to the school.


661
00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:21.144
I gave them
LAPD hats and T-shirts.


662
00:27:21.178 --> 00:27:23.513
And you know what? Katie seemed
to be pretty happy with that.


663
00:27:23.547 --> 00:27:25.648
Yeah, but that's just 'cause
Katie thinks you're amazing.


664
00:27:25.683 --> 00:27:27.517
Come on. How much cooler
is the ride-along?


665
00:27:27.551 --> 00:27:29.719
I mean, you always said that
you'd do anything for the school.


666
00:27:29.753 --> 00:27:31.387
I know, and I would.

667
00:27:31.422 --> 00:27:34.757
And to prove it, I bought
the ride-along today for $250.


668
00:27:34.792 --> 00:27:37.227
It's a win-win --
the school gets the money,


669
00:27:37.261 --> 00:27:40.330
and I don't have to drive around
town with some crime-crazed mom.


670
00:27:40.364 --> 00:27:41.397
What?

671
00:27:41.432 --> 00:27:42.565
It went for $400.

672
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.601
- $400?
- Mm-hmm.


673
00:27:44.635 --> 00:27:48.972
What kind of an idiot
spends $400 to ride ar--


674
00:27:50.641 --> 00:27:53.409
Oh, I didn't know
it was you, Katie.


675
00:27:53.444 --> 00:27:54.477
It's okay.

676
00:27:54.512 --> 00:27:55.912
No, it's not.

677
00:27:55.946 --> 00:27:58.181
I'm -- I'm -- I'm sorry.
I thought --


678
00:27:58.215 --> 00:28:00.517
I thought it was another mom --
one I didn't know.


679
00:28:00.551 --> 00:28:02.452
Of course. Yeah.

680
00:28:02.486 --> 00:28:04.120
Let me buy it back.

681
00:28:04.154 --> 00:28:07.056
No! No. It's okay.
It's for a good cause.


682
00:28:07.091 --> 00:28:08.725
No, really.
I-I feel terrible about this.


683
00:28:08.759 --> 00:28:11.794
I'm so sorry. Can you just --
let me reimburse you for it.


684
00:28:11.829 --> 00:28:15.298
Don't worry about it.
Gloria, really.


685
00:28:15.332 --> 00:28:17.734
Do you like
noodle bowl?


686
00:28:33.417 --> 00:28:35.018
Dulcett.

687
00:28:35.052 --> 00:28:36.519
Hi, it's me.

688
00:28:36.554 --> 00:28:38.388
Another food truck
was set on fire.


689
00:28:38.422 --> 00:28:39.422
What?

690
00:28:39.456 --> 00:28:40.690
When?

691
00:28:40.724 --> 00:28:42.258
I just got the call.

692
00:28:42.293 --> 00:28:44.360
I-it was
Tyler's Rolling Diner.


693
00:28:44.395 --> 00:28:47.230
That's the guy that gave up
Joey Hotlinks, right?


694
00:28:47.264 --> 00:28:49.532
Yeah. And, 'Chelle,
he was on the truck.


695
00:28:49.567 --> 00:28:52.302
H-he was sleeping on the truck
when it went up.


696
00:28:52.336 --> 00:28:54.103
Oh, my God.

697
00:28:54.138 --> 00:28:55.271
He's -- he's alive.

698
00:28:55.306 --> 00:28:56.639
He somehow
managed to get out,


699
00:28:56.674 --> 00:28:58.508
but he's --
he's pretty badly burned,


700
00:28:58.542 --> 00:29:00.710
so they have him in ICU,
so I want to just --


701
00:29:00.744 --> 00:29:02.345
I want to just
head over there


702
00:29:02.379 --> 00:29:04.047
first thing
in the morning, okay?


703
00:29:04.081 --> 00:29:05.682
- All right.
- I'll see you then.


704
00:29:13.042 --> 00:29:15.109
Romeo and Buerge
just picked up Joey Hotlinks.


705
00:29:15.144 --> 00:29:17.545
They're taking him back to RHD
so we can talk to him.


706
00:29:17.579 --> 00:29:19.781
That guy's got some nerve,
torching Tyler's truck


707
00:29:19.815 --> 00:29:21.582
while we're looking at him
for Wilson's.


708
00:29:23.686 --> 00:29:25.520
It's like he's
rubbing our noses in it.


709
00:29:25.554 --> 00:29:27.522
Hey. I hear this guy's
pretty badly burned.


710
00:29:27.556 --> 00:29:29.657
You sure you're gonna be okay
with this, Glo?


711
00:29:29.692 --> 00:29:30.892
Yeah, I'm fine.
Thanks.


712
00:29:35.331 --> 00:29:37.732
Poor kid.

713
00:29:37.766 --> 00:29:39.200
You know what?

714
00:29:39.234 --> 00:29:41.736
I was thinking about it
all night, Michelle.


715
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:43.771
And this fire
was different.


716
00:29:43.806 --> 00:29:46.574
The first one
was just a cover-up,


717
00:29:46.608 --> 00:29:49.077
but this one
was premeditated.


718
00:29:49.111 --> 00:29:51.145
They're both arson.

719
00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:54.482
Okay, maybe killing Wilson
was an accident,


720
00:29:54.516 --> 00:29:57.385
but Joey saw that it would
scare the other trucks


721
00:29:57.419 --> 00:30:00.588
into joining his union,
so maybe he staged an encore.


722
00:30:00.622 --> 00:30:03.491
Yeah. Maybe.
I don't know.


723
00:30:08.664 --> 00:30:10.098
Tyler.

724
00:30:10.132 --> 00:30:13.468
I'm Detective Sheppard.
We spoke yesterday.


725
00:30:13.502 --> 00:30:16.437
This is my partner,
Detective Dulcett.


726
00:30:16.472 --> 00:30:19.440
The doctors tell us
that you're a very lucky man.


727
00:30:19.475 --> 00:30:22.343
Cool.

728
00:30:22.378 --> 00:30:26.214
Tyler, do you always park
your truck on that street?


729
00:30:26.248 --> 00:30:27.215
On Hastings?

730
00:30:27.249 --> 00:30:28.950
I sleep...

731
00:30:28.984 --> 00:30:30.785
A-are you saying
that you parked there


732
00:30:30.819 --> 00:30:33.054
when you wanted to sleep
on the truck?


733
00:30:35.357 --> 00:30:37.058
Did Joey Hotlinks
know this?


734
00:30:37.092 --> 00:30:39.260
Yeah.

735
00:30:39.294 --> 00:30:40.595
He...

736
00:30:40.629 --> 00:30:41.729
He left.

737
00:30:41.764 --> 00:30:44.265
Did he start the fire,
Tyler?


738
00:30:44.299 --> 00:30:46.034
Rod...

739
00:30:48.137 --> 00:30:49.737
What about Rod?

740
00:30:49.772 --> 00:30:51.906
I left...

741
00:30:57.613 --> 00:30:59.881
He confirms
that Joey Hotlinks


742
00:30:59.915 --> 00:31:02.750
knew where he parked
the truck at night.


743
00:31:02.785 --> 00:31:04.252
Yeah.

744
00:31:04.286 --> 00:31:07.255
All right,
let's go talk to him.


745
00:31:07.289 --> 00:31:08.656
You guys
got nothing on me.


746
00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:10.758
Yeah, well, I wouldn't exactly
call it nothing, okay?


747
00:31:10.793 --> 00:31:12.527
I've got two trucks
that have been torched,


748
00:31:12.561 --> 00:31:14.495
I have a young man
in the burn ward,


749
00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:17.365
I have you with an arson
conviction on your record,


750
00:31:17.399 --> 00:31:19.067
and I have
a line of people


751
00:31:19.101 --> 00:31:20.735
willing to testify
that you threatened them,


752
00:31:20.769 --> 00:31:21.736
so that's
not exactly nothing.


753
00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:23.438
It's all circumstantial.

754
00:31:23.472 --> 00:31:24.839
People have gone away
for less.


755
00:31:24.873 --> 00:31:26.808
Tell me this --
do you have an alibi


756
00:31:26.842 --> 00:31:28.576
for where you were
last night,


757
00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:30.344
when Tyler McManus' truck
went up in flames?


758
00:31:30.379 --> 00:31:32.180
Hey, I liked that kid.

759
00:31:32.214 --> 00:31:34.849
I guess he didn't have the
protection he thought he had.


760
00:31:34.883 --> 00:31:37.552
- Are you still making threats?
- No, it's what he said to me.


761
00:31:37.586 --> 00:31:40.521
He said he didn't need me
or anyone to protect him.


762
00:31:40.556 --> 00:31:42.256
Said he had the angels
on his side.


763
00:31:42.291 --> 00:31:44.358
You believe that?

764
00:31:44.393 --> 00:31:45.626
Some angels.

765
00:31:45.661 --> 00:31:48.262
Look, when was the last time
you saw Tyler?


766
00:31:48.297 --> 00:31:50.498
Huh?

767
00:31:50.532 --> 00:31:52.166
Lieutenant Valdez.

768
00:31:52.201 --> 00:31:55.336
The Saint Michael's medallion --
it belonged to Tyler.


769
00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:58.039
H-he thought that it brought him
protection and good luck.


770
00:31:58.073 --> 00:31:59.874
So the medallion
put him in Rod Wilson's truck.


771
00:31:59.908 --> 00:32:01.476
You think he's the guy
who killed Wilson?


772
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:03.311
It's starting to add up
like that, yeah.


773
00:32:04.513 --> 00:32:06.714
Tyler McManus' room?

774
00:32:10.052 --> 00:32:11.786
But how does that fit in
with your theory


775
00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.122
that the killer and Wilson
had a history of bad blood?


776
00:32:14.156 --> 00:32:16.057
Hey, 'Chelle,
when you were questioning


777
00:32:16.091 --> 00:32:18.092
the other people
at the trucks yesterday,


778
00:32:18.127 --> 00:32:19.727
how many of them knew
Bridget Wilson by name?


779
00:32:19.761 --> 00:32:21.229
All of them.

780
00:32:21.263 --> 00:32:22.630
Yes. Same with me,
except for one guy.


781
00:32:22.664 --> 00:32:24.065
- Tyler McManus?
- Yeah.


782
00:32:24.099 --> 00:32:25.733
Now, why would he do that

783
00:32:25.767 --> 00:32:27.768
unless he was intentionally
trying to hide that connection?


784
00:32:27.803 --> 00:32:29.403
He didn't want us
to suspect


785
00:32:29.438 --> 00:32:32.673
that he had ties
with Bridget and her dad.


786
00:32:32.708 --> 00:32:34.809
And then when we went to visit
Bridget last night,


787
00:32:34.843 --> 00:32:36.777
she mentioned
a guy that she liked


788
00:32:36.812 --> 00:32:38.279
that her dad
didn't approve of.


789
00:32:38.313 --> 00:32:39.380
- Tyler.
- Yeah.


790
00:32:39.414 --> 00:32:41.249
So Rod
didn't approve of Tyler,


791
00:32:41.283 --> 00:32:43.651
but Tyler was in love
with Rod's daughter.


792
00:32:43.685 --> 00:32:46.154
I mean, that's
plenty of motive right there.


793
00:32:46.188 --> 00:32:48.422
Is there a world where
Tyler and Bridget Wilson


794
00:32:48.457 --> 00:32:51.325
team up together
to kill Bridget's dad?


795
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.693
No, I can't see that.

796
00:32:52.728 --> 00:32:55.296
I mean, Bridget is
crazy loyal to her...Dad.


797
00:32:57.266 --> 00:33:00.201
You know what? We have to get
some Unis at the hospital.


798
00:33:00.235 --> 00:33:02.236
'Chelle, can you
call the hospital


799
00:33:02.271 --> 00:33:04.805
and tell them to keep an eye out
for Bridget?


800
00:33:10.579 --> 00:33:11.946
She isn't answering.

801
00:33:13.415 --> 00:33:14.515
Hey, baby.

802
00:33:15.784 --> 00:33:18.586
Missed you.

803
00:33:21.723 --> 00:33:24.458
Okay, I was just
trying to...


804
00:33:24.493 --> 00:33:27.261
You know...

805
00:33:27.296 --> 00:33:29.697
Just talk to your dad.

806
00:33:33.168 --> 00:33:35.336
Why wouldn't he
let us be together?


807
00:33:37.439 --> 00:33:38.773
It's okay.

808
00:33:38.807 --> 00:33:41.008
I never wanted
to hurt you.


809
00:33:42.444 --> 00:33:43.945
I know.

810
00:33:43.979 --> 00:33:46.847
Okay, I spoke to security
at the hospital.


811
00:33:46.882 --> 00:33:48.916
They're sending someone up
to Tyler's room right now.


812
00:33:48.951 --> 00:33:51.219
Wait a minute.
I thought Bridget loved Tyler.


813
00:33:51.253 --> 00:33:52.887
She does. Doesn't mean
she wouldn't kill him.


814
00:33:54.423 --> 00:33:56.691
I love you.

815
00:33:59.595 --> 00:34:01.896
I love you, too.

816
00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.994
I killed him.

817
00:35:15.029 --> 00:35:16.529
Don't say anything.

818
00:35:16.563 --> 00:35:18.231
You have the right
to an attorney.


819
00:35:18.265 --> 00:35:20.199
It doesn't matter.

820
00:35:20.234 --> 00:35:22.035
I had to do it.

821
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:24.404
If you knew
Tyler killed your father,


822
00:35:24.438 --> 00:35:26.239
why didn't you tell us?

823
00:35:26.273 --> 00:35:28.274
Because jail
wasn't enough, was it?


824
00:35:28.309 --> 00:35:31.377
Tyler killed my dad.

825
00:35:31.412 --> 00:35:33.446
He had to pay for that.

826
00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.049
Yes, but you loved him.

827
00:35:36.083 --> 00:35:37.583
Did you do this
because you thought


828
00:35:37.618 --> 00:35:39.252
your dad
wanted you to do it?


829
00:35:39.286 --> 00:35:41.354
I wanted to.

830
00:35:41.388 --> 00:35:42.689
So yesterday,
when you were surprised


831
00:35:42.723 --> 00:35:44.190
that no one stayed
to help your dad,


832
00:35:44.224 --> 00:35:47.160
you were surprised because
you expected Tyler to stay.


833
00:35:47.194 --> 00:35:49.662
My dad was awful to him,

834
00:35:49.697 --> 00:35:52.598
but Tyler
would have stayed for me.


835
00:35:52.633 --> 00:35:54.067
And the only way
he wouldn't


836
00:35:54.101 --> 00:35:56.102
was if he was the one
who killed him.


837
00:36:01.275 --> 00:36:03.576
Why did he do it?

838
00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:08.948
Because of what he did,
I had to kill him.


839
00:36:11.585 --> 00:36:15.254
I had two people
that I loved...


840
00:36:15.289 --> 00:36:17.490
And now I've got no one.

841
00:36:23.097 --> 00:36:25.398
So, what now?

842
00:36:25.432 --> 00:36:26.899
You handcuff me?

843
00:36:29.002 --> 00:36:31.204
Turn around, please. Clasp
your hands behind your back.


844
00:36:31.238 --> 00:36:33.172
You have the right
to remain silent.


845
00:36:33.207 --> 00:36:35.575
Anything you say or do will be held
against you in a court of law.


846
00:36:35.609 --> 00:36:36.609
You have a right
to an attorney.


847
00:36:36.643 --> 00:36:38.044
If you do not have
an attorney,


848
00:36:38.078 --> 00:36:39.912
one will be appointed to you
by the courts.


849
00:36:39.947 --> 00:36:41.948
Do you understand your rights
as I have read them?


850
00:36:46.253 --> 00:36:48.020
Hey, L.T.

851
00:36:48.055 --> 00:36:49.589
That thing yesterday...

852
00:36:49.623 --> 00:36:52.024
Turned out to be
a false alarm.


853
00:36:52.059 --> 00:36:54.160
Yeah, she went to OB
this morning.


854
00:36:54.194 --> 00:36:55.561
Well,
you must be relieved.


855
00:36:55.596 --> 00:36:56.763
Yeah.

856
00:36:56.797 --> 00:36:58.831
Um...I guess.

857
00:36:58.866 --> 00:37:00.533
No. No, I
-I am.

858
00:37:00.567 --> 00:37:02.201
Because yesterday...

859
00:37:02.236 --> 00:37:04.570
Yeah, I know. I was ready
to jump off the building.


860
00:37:04.605 --> 00:37:06.606
Yeah.
Uh...


861
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.809
Guess I have to admit, I was
starting to get used to the idea


862
00:37:09.843 --> 00:37:12.078
of having a little Buerge
running around.


863
00:37:12.112 --> 00:37:14.781
Teach him how to play ball,
and...Such.


864
00:37:16.183 --> 00:37:19.152
Let me explain
something to you.


865
00:37:19.186 --> 00:37:22.288
The first six months
you have a kid, you don't sleep.


866
00:37:22.322 --> 00:37:25.792
I'm talking three hours
at a stretch, if you're lucky.


867
00:37:25.826 --> 00:37:28.828
And your wife expects you to be as
psychically tuned in to the baby


868
00:37:28.862 --> 00:37:30.463
as she is,
which is impossible.


869
00:37:30.497 --> 00:37:33.332
You're not going out. You're sure
as hell not getting laid.


870
00:37:35.335 --> 00:37:37.003
I thought you said
it was...


871
00:37:37.037 --> 00:37:38.905
The greatest thing
to happen to mankind.


872
00:37:38.939 --> 00:37:40.006
Oh, it is.

873
00:37:41.575 --> 00:37:43.543
You don't need
that kind of grief.


874
00:37:43.577 --> 00:37:44.944
Go have fun.

875
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.762
Hey, Davey,
is everything okay between us?


876
00:38:02.796 --> 00:38:04.730
- Yeah. Why?
- I don't know.


877
00:38:04.765 --> 00:38:07.333
I just kind of felt like
the last couple of days,


878
00:38:07.367 --> 00:38:10.236
you've just sort of been kind of
undermining me a little bit.


879
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.905
I -- I just didn't know if you were
mad about something, or...


880
00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:16.442
No. How have I been
undermining you?


881
00:38:16.477 --> 00:38:18.878
Well, you know, like --
like yesterday


882
00:38:18.912 --> 00:38:21.447
when you asked me
to make Katie a latte,


883
00:38:21.482 --> 00:38:23.282
and it was -- you know,
it was pretty clear


884
00:38:23.317 --> 00:38:24.817
I was trying to get out the
door, and I just felt like --


885
00:38:24.852 --> 00:38:26.919
Oh, yeah. The latte thing.
I can explain that.


886
00:38:26.954 --> 00:38:28.888
That's easy. Um...
You make a great latte.


887
00:38:30.524 --> 00:38:31.824
That's it?

888
00:38:31.859 --> 00:38:33.860
Hope that didn't hurt
too bad.


889
00:38:33.894 --> 00:38:35.394
O-okay.
Well, you know what?


890
00:38:35.429 --> 00:38:36.896
What about this whole
ride-along thing?


891
00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:38.431
I mean,
that's kind of been, like --


892
00:38:38.465 --> 00:38:40.700
Why would you assume that I have
a bad motive about that?


893
00:38:40.734 --> 00:38:42.335
Since when have I
not been on your side?


894
00:38:42.369 --> 00:38:44.837
No. Y-you've always been
on my side. I'm not saying that.


895
00:38:44.872 --> 00:38:47.807
It's just -- it -- it -- I just
didn't get it. It felt weird.


896
00:38:47.841 --> 00:38:49.141
- The truth?
- Yeah. Of course.


897
00:38:49.176 --> 00:38:50.910
That's why I'm asking you.
I mean...


898
00:38:50.944 --> 00:38:52.245
I volunteered you
for the ride-along


899
00:38:52.279 --> 00:38:53.746
because I thought
it would be awesome.


900
00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.249
Well, awesome for you, maybe,
'cause you're not gonna be


901
00:38:56.283 --> 00:38:58.417
stuck in a car with
some stranger making small talk.


902
00:38:58.452 --> 00:39:00.586
You know, I'm just --
I'm not good at that stuff.


903
00:39:00.621 --> 00:39:02.255
You know I'm not good
at that stuff.


904
00:39:02.289 --> 00:39:03.656
Well, then,
time to figure it out.


905
00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:06.859
You're smart.
Stop hiding, and suit up.


906
00:39:06.894 --> 00:39:08.528
You're
an interesting person.


907
00:39:08.562 --> 00:39:11.397
You need to figure out
how to talk to regular people.


908
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.567
You know what?

909
00:39:14.601 --> 00:39:17.236
I think that you and I
have very different definitions


910
00:39:17.271 --> 00:39:19.405
of what makes
a person regular.


911
00:39:19.439 --> 00:39:20.373
No doubt.

912
00:39:22.075 --> 00:39:26.279
And, in full disclosure,
I had a secondary motive.


913
00:39:26.313 --> 00:39:27.980
I was feeling competitive.

914
00:39:28.015 --> 00:39:30.016
I was looking at everything
that was donated,


915
00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:31.617
and I thought
a ride-along with you


916
00:39:31.652 --> 00:39:33.753
was way cooler
than a ski cabin in Mammoth


917
00:39:33.787 --> 00:39:35.821
or some lame-ass
horseback ride.


918
00:39:35.856 --> 00:39:39.025
Again, sorry
if I hit a nerve.


919
00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.895
Look, I'm sorry
for doubting you, okay?


920
00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:44.397
That's what brothers
are for.


921
00:39:45.699 --> 00:39:47.833
I'm gonna be late. I have to
get to a stake-out right now,


922
00:39:47.868 --> 00:39:50.570
so I'll just see you in the morning, okay?
Good night, sweetie.


923
00:39:50.604 --> 00:39:51.537
Okay. Yeah.
All right.


924
00:39:53.607 --> 00:39:55.408
See the guy in the sports coat

925
00:39:55.442 --> 00:39:56.576
with the one grocery bag?

926
00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:57.877
Well, he's divorced.

927
00:39:57.911 --> 00:40:00.546
- Not just single?
- Mnh-mnh.


928
00:40:00.581 --> 00:40:03.049
He's got that other bag,
which is from the toy store,


929
00:40:03.083 --> 00:40:05.451
so he's probably got the kids
for the weekend.


930
00:40:05.485 --> 00:40:07.253
Oh...

931
00:40:10.357 --> 00:40:12.058
Oh, and check out these two,
all right?


932
00:40:12.092 --> 00:40:13.793
They're cheating
on their spouses.


933
00:40:13.827 --> 00:40:15.661
How do you know?

934
00:40:15.696 --> 00:40:18.064
Well, one tailed the other one
into the valet,


935
00:40:18.098 --> 00:40:20.499
but then they put distance
between themselves


936
00:40:20.534 --> 00:40:21.834
when they started walking,

937
00:40:21.868 --> 00:40:24.537
so we just have to
wait for it...


938
00:40:24.571 --> 00:40:26.572
Wait for it...

939
00:40:26.607 --> 00:40:27.707
Wow!

940
00:40:27.741 --> 00:40:28.674
Oh, the humanity!

941
00:40:29.743 --> 00:40:31.844
Gosh!

942
00:40:31.878 --> 00:40:33.679
Hey, you know, I --
I know that you did this


943
00:40:33.714 --> 00:40:35.014
just to get Davey
off the hook,


944
00:40:35.048 --> 00:40:36.382
but it's --
it's really sweet.


945
00:40:36.416 --> 00:40:38.284
No! No, I'm
having a good time. I am.


946
00:40:38.318 --> 00:40:40.653
- Me too.
- Oh, great.


947
00:40:40.687 --> 00:40:42.555
You want to
give it a shot?


948
00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:43.789
Yeah.

949
00:40:43.824 --> 00:40:45.391
All right.
Uh, let me see here.


950
00:40:45.425 --> 00:40:47.627
All right, you see
that woman at the cafe?


951
00:40:47.661 --> 00:40:48.995
The one
with the great hair?


952
00:40:49.029 --> 00:40:50.630
- Mm-hmm.
- What's her story?


953
00:40:51.932 --> 00:40:53.566
She's got a date.

954
00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.935
Very good. Yes.
What else?


955
00:40:55.969 --> 00:40:57.937
She's married?
Cold.


956
00:40:57.971 --> 00:40:58.904
Divorced?
Colder.


957
00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.475
I'm just gonna
flip all the cards here, okay?


958
00:41:02.509 --> 00:41:03.776
Uh...She's a he.

959
00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:05.945
What?! No way!

960
00:41:05.979 --> 00:41:07.113
Way!
Look at her hands.


961
00:41:07.147 --> 00:41:08.481
Look at her hair.

962
00:41:08.515 --> 00:41:09.915
I know.
It's great, isn't it?


963
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:11.584
Look at that outfit.

964
00:41:11.618 --> 00:41:14.553
Man, I wish I could put together
an outfit like that.


965
00:41:14.588 --> 00:41:15.921
Oh, I could
help you do that.


966
00:41:15.956 --> 00:41:17.923
No. I mean,
she spent a fortune on it.


967
00:41:17.958 --> 00:41:19.358
That's designer stuff.

968
00:41:19.393 --> 00:41:21.494
No. You just have to know
where to shop.


969
00:41:21.528 --> 00:41:22.762
- Really?
- Yeah!


970
00:41:22.796 --> 00:41:24.830
Have you been to the outlet mall
at Camarillo?


971
00:41:24.865 --> 00:41:26.599
No. Unh-unh.
I'm gonna take you.


972
00:41:26.633 --> 00:41:28.567
- It'll be fun.
- Oh! All right. Great.


973
00:41:28.602 --> 00:41:30.636
That would be f--
that would be fun.


974
00:41:31.982 --> 00:41:35.982
