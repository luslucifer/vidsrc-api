1
00:02:13.096 --> 00:02:14.536
Come on, boys.

2
00:02:15.185 --> 00:02:17.660
Get him out of there.
Yeah, there we go.


3
00:02:17.736 --> 00:02:19.776
Bring him on up here.

4
00:02:19.976 --> 00:02:21.096
He's a goner.

5
00:02:21.296 --> 00:02:25.936
Yep, definitely Buc Woodriff.
Goddammit!


6
00:02:26.136 --> 00:02:29.737
Unbelievable. This is the third
fishing accident this year.


7
00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:31.537
Shit.

8
00:02:31.736 --> 00:02:34.216
I was kinda hoping it'd be Rusty Boyd.
Curtis!


9
00:02:35.176 --> 00:02:37.537
Would you step back, please.

10
00:02:41.097 --> 00:02:42.657
Rusty Boyd?

11
00:02:42.856 --> 00:02:45.097
Rusty's been banging his wife.

12
00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:46.936
No shit?

13
00:02:48.097 --> 00:02:49.777
So what do you think?

14
00:02:50.697 --> 00:02:54.456
I gotta be honest, boss.
I thought he was a Bud man.


15
00:02:54.657 --> 00:03:00.417
Yeah. I think he went for a cold one
and slipped in a hole. End of story.


16
00:03:01.216 --> 00:03:03.656
Sounds good to me.

17
00:03:04.257 --> 00:03:06.057
Here comes the family.

18
00:03:10.017 --> 00:03:13.377
- You want me to take care of them?
- No.


19
00:03:14.216 --> 00:03:16.097
You wait here.

20
00:03:20.497 --> 00:03:22.697
You don't have to
look at me like that.

21
00:03:23.497 --> 00:03:25.857
Come on, fellers,
get this guy covered up.


22
00:03:28.617 --> 00:03:30.017
Folks...

23
00:03:31.017 --> 00:03:33.457
I'm afraid it's not good news.

24
00:03:33.657 --> 00:03:35.377
Is he dead?

25
00:03:36.177 --> 00:03:38.058
Step back! Step back!

26
00:03:39.617 --> 00:03:42.978
If it's any comfort to you,
it was a peaceful passing.


27
00:03:43.177 --> 00:03:44.457
Thank God.

28
00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:46.457
Follow me, please.

29
00:03:56.698 --> 00:03:58.898
Peaceful my ass.

30
00:03:59.097 --> 00:04:01.098
Poor bastard.

31
00:04:03.538 --> 00:04:06.738
Must have froze on impact.

32
00:04:07.017 --> 00:04:09.978
He's still a good looking man.

33
00:04:11.338 --> 00:04:15.257
<i>As I stand here looking
at my father's lifeless body.</i>


34
00:04:15.458 --> 00:04:20.737
<i>I wish I could feel something,
but all I feel is cold.</i>


35
00:04:20.938 --> 00:04:22.338
Dad,

36
00:04:22.537 --> 00:04:25.218
I'd like to have his wedding ring.

37
00:04:28.378 --> 00:04:30.337
Well...

38
00:04:33.258 --> 00:04:34.738
it's froze stuck.

39
00:04:39.018 --> 00:04:40.378
Oh shit!

40
00:04:40.578 --> 00:04:42.658
Let me help you with that.

41
00:04:43.018 --> 00:04:47.658
<i>Since my first waking memory,
I've been asking myself the same question:</i>


42
00:04:47.778 --> 00:04:50.658
- Here! Got it!
<i>- Who are these people?</i>


43
00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:53.298
It was a good idea.
It's gold.


44
00:04:54.739 --> 00:04:55.898
Bye, bye, Buc.

45
00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.539
<i>I can't help but think that somehow
in the grand scheme of things</i>


46
00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:03.619
<i>- I've ended up in the wrong family.</i>
- Is somebody gonna come get him?


47
00:05:03.818 --> 00:05:05.098
I certainly hope so.

48
00:05:05.299 --> 00:05:08.378
They always come and get him. Are you
just gonna let him lay out here on the ice-


49
00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:10.739
- like a dang frozen cod?
- No.


50
00:05:10.938 --> 00:05:13.379
<i>I've always tried to blend in.</i>

51
00:05:18.859 --> 00:05:21.699
Run!
Run for your life!


52
00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:24.859
What the hell's wrong with you, boy!

53
00:05:38.098 --> 00:05:40.459
Buc, why do you always
you have to do....


54
00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:42.779
I've had enough of you, woman!

55
00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:46.019
Don't go! Buc!

56
00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:48.299
Buc!

57
00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:50.499
- Buc, no! Don't go!
- Let go of me.


58
00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:52.779
Don't go, please.
I'm sorry.


59
00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:54.819
I'm so sorry.

60
00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:59.219
<i>As I pondered my future of manure,
rifle racks and a six-pack,</i>


61
00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.139
<i>the idea of death by a Rototiller
was looking better by the minute.</i>


62
00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:04.739
<i>But then...</i>

63
00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:07.316
<i>Caesar arrived.</i>

64
00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:16.819
The Taco tucker's here.

65
00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:19.500
<i>Caesar was an exchange student
from Puerto Rico.</i>


66
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.380
<i>We had absolutely nothing in common.</i>

67
00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:30.420
<i>Or... so I thought.</i>

68
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.819
Hey, Caesar!

69
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.580
Ooh, sorry...
I gotta know. Who is that?


70
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.940
- What's your name?
- Bitsy!


71
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.620
- It's Bitsy.
- No. Who's playing?


72
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.700
I don't know.

73
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.300
Well, what kind of music is that?

74
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.780
Harlan, it's salsa.
Now get out.


75
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.500
I was only kidding.
I know your name.


76
00:07:08.341 --> 00:07:09.580
Nice to meet you...

77
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.780
Bitsy.

78
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.220
Salsa.

79
00:08:17.061 --> 00:08:18.941
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>

80
00:08:19.141 --> 00:08:21.901
<i>my father never even heard me play.</i>

81
00:08:26.021 --> 00:08:28.261
<i>But maybe that was a good thing.</i>

82
00:09:41.422 --> 00:09:45.422
Mom, grandpa, I'm leaving.

83
00:09:45.902 --> 00:09:48.742
That's fine, dear.
Will you be home for dinner?


84
00:09:49.262 --> 00:09:52.223
No. I'm going to Los Angeles.

85
00:09:54.222 --> 00:09:56.942
- California?
- Yeah.


86
00:09:57.479 --> 00:09:58.866
Oh.

87
00:09:59.422 --> 00:10:02.702
Why in the hell would you wanna go
out to a cesspool like that?


88
00:10:03.063 --> 00:10:06.783
I want to play salsa in a band,
a real band.


89
00:10:07.102 --> 00:10:08.543
That's nice, dear

90
00:10:08.742 --> 00:10:12.143
That's the dumbest damn thing
I ever heard of. Pass the margarine.


91
00:10:13.262 --> 00:10:16.063
Why in the hell can't we get
butter on this table once in a while?


92
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.222
Damn margarine?

93
00:12:04.784 --> 00:12:06.904
Excuse me, sir.

94
00:12:07.104 --> 00:12:09.424
Can I trouble you for some coffee?

95
00:12:29.425 --> 00:12:30.824
Thanks.

96
00:12:35.465 --> 00:12:37.864
Doughnut?

97
00:12:38.264 --> 00:12:40.225
Sure.

98
00:13:15.905 --> 00:13:17.866
Got a light?

99
00:13:18.145 --> 00:13:20.945
Oh, I'm sorry.
I though no one was sitting there.


100
00:13:21.105 --> 00:13:24.185
Well, clearly I am.

101
00:13:35.305 --> 00:13:38.546
Hey, I was just messing with you.

102
00:13:38.745 --> 00:13:40.346
- Where are you from?
- Wyoming.


103
00:13:40.545 --> 00:13:43.945
Wyoming. Where men are men,
and sheep are nervous.


104
00:13:45.786 --> 00:13:47.105
Yeah.

105
00:13:48.146 --> 00:13:51.286
Actually, there are a lot
more cows than sheep.


106
00:13:51.666 --> 00:13:53.825
They're even raising ostriches now.

107
00:13:55.226 --> 00:13:57.066
You mean like Big Bird?

108
00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:00.825
- Kinda.
- No shit.


109
00:14:01.746 --> 00:14:03.186
Why?

110
00:14:03.825 --> 00:14:06.826
They are the new red meat.

111
00:14:07.265 --> 00:14:10.186
But I hear it taste more like chicken.

112
00:14:11.066 --> 00:14:14.026
- That's really disturbing.
- I'm sorry...


113
00:14:14.226 --> 00:14:15.666
- Did you ever eat one?
- No.


114
00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:17.426
No.

115
00:14:18.346 --> 00:14:21.706
Good. That's good.

116
00:14:24.786 --> 00:14:27.786
- I'd better be hitting the road.
- Where are you headed?


117
00:14:28.266 --> 00:14:31.146
- LA.
- Yeah? Where you staying?


118
00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.546
In Venice.
With a friend.


119
00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:35.386
What's his name?
Maybe I know him.


120
00:14:35.586 --> 00:14:38.546
- I don't think you know him.
- I know a lot of people.


121
00:14:38.746 --> 00:14:41.706
- Caesar Lopez.
- Caesar Lopez. Never heard of him.


122
00:14:47.506 --> 00:14:51.452
Did you ever feel like you just
had to get away? Start things over, you know?


123
00:14:51.452 --> 00:14:53.427
- Did you ever feel like that?
- Yeah, yeah, I do.


124
00:14:53.626 --> 00:14:55.507
Well, that's what I'm trying to do.

125
00:14:56.867 --> 00:14:58.426
You never saw me, right?

126
00:15:12.587 --> 00:15:16.266
Excuse me, um...
How much do I owe you?


127
00:15:26.547 --> 00:15:28.467
Where's your friend?

128
00:15:32.347 --> 00:15:35.067
I don't have a friend.
I'm here alone.


129
00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:38.947
Who's driving the motherfucking Fastback?

130
00:15:39.547 --> 00:15:43.027
You got me.
The cook?


131
00:15:44.227 --> 00:15:49.307
Dwayne, why don't you check it out,
and I'll keep our new buddy company.


132
00:15:52.787 --> 00:15:54.667
- Let me buy you another doughnut?
- No.


133
00:15:54.867 --> 00:15:57.547
I'm fine.
Thank you.


134
00:15:57.747 --> 00:15:59.747
I insist.

135
00:16:03.788 --> 00:16:05.387
That's unappetizing.

136
00:16:10.548 --> 00:16:14.147
You know, someone should report
this fucking dive to the health department.


137
00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:15.664
How about a bagel?

138
00:16:40.308 --> 00:16:43.668
I... think I'm gonna be leaving now.

139
00:16:55.988 --> 00:16:58.188
Hey, kid.
Wait a minute.


140
00:17:02.708 --> 00:17:06.028
You're not gonna get
very far without these.


141
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.189
Slow down!

142
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.270
Slow down! Slow down!
Break!


143
00:18:57.229 --> 00:18:58.869
Jesus Christ!
Give me a dollar.


144
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.710
- No!
- Give me a dollar!


145
00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.190
- I want a dollar. You tried to kill me.
- God, I'm sorry.


146
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.430
- I didn't see you. I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.


147
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:08.189
You tried to kill me.
Give me the dollar.


148
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.310
I want a dollar, I want a dollar now.
Give me a dollar. You tried to kill me.


149
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:15.250
Give me the damn dollar!
Get the hell outta here!


150
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.950
Shit.

151
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.991
Let me in. Come on, let me in.

152
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:27.791
Harlan...

153
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.230
Get your Wyoming ass up here.

154
00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:32.790
All right.
I'm coming.


155
00:19:36.831 --> 00:19:41.110
Hey, you're here. How was your trip?
You look like shit.


156
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.791
I pulled an all nighter

157
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.310
You need a shower
and a shot of tequila.


158
00:19:45.311 --> 00:19:47.791
- Come on. I'll help you with your stuff.
- Cool.


159
00:19:50.551 --> 00:19:54.351
Okay. That's it for now.

160
00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:58.991
Are you crazy? This ain't Wyoming.
Don't be leaving any shit in your car.


161
00:19:59.191 --> 00:20:01.231
They'll steal your ass blind.

162
00:20:12.951 --> 00:20:16.351
- No more, no more
- Harlan, don't be a pussy.


163
00:20:16.551 --> 00:20:18.191
All right, just a half.

164
00:20:18.391 --> 00:20:21.231
- You don't like my tequila?
- All right, fill her up. I'm in LA.


165
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.911
- What the hell?
- That's right. You're in LA. Salute.


166
00:20:24.111 --> 00:20:25.431
Cheers.

167
00:20:33.591 --> 00:20:36.591
- It's good to see you, my brother.
- You too.


168
00:20:36.792 --> 00:20:39.392
So what do you think of the paintings?
Impressive, no?


169
00:20:40.151 --> 00:20:41.271
They're nice.

170
00:20:41.471 --> 00:20:45.111
Very realistic.
Are they photographs?


171
00:20:45.311 --> 00:20:47.872
What? No, man.
I painted them.


172
00:20:48.071 --> 00:20:52.491
I was thinking about sending one to your family.
You know, a little thank you for taking me in.


173
00:20:53.352 --> 00:20:55.631
I was thinking maybe this one.

174
00:20:57.431 --> 00:20:59.112
It's perfect.

175
00:20:59.136 --> 00:21:01.136
Oh, hey, hey...

176
00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:07.431
My mom sent you some
of her corn relish.


177
00:21:07.632 --> 00:21:10.031
- I love this shit.
- I know.


178
00:21:10.512 --> 00:21:13.512
Tell her I said thank you, please.

179
00:21:13.711 --> 00:21:15.992
- You want some?
- No.


180
00:21:20.672 --> 00:21:22.992
I'm sorry about your dad.

181
00:21:24.152 --> 00:21:25.372
Thanks.

182
00:21:26.752 --> 00:21:28.752
You know, we hadn't seen him
for a couple of years, so...


183
00:21:28.752 --> 00:21:30.392
That doesn't make it any easier.

184
00:21:31.672 --> 00:21:34.392
No. I guess not.

185
00:21:34.992 --> 00:21:37.872
Hey, we don't have
to talk about it. Okay?


186
00:21:44.632 --> 00:21:47.632
How about this, man?
Nice, huh?


187
00:21:51.352 --> 00:21:54.592
- Come on. Dance with me.
- Oh, shit.


188
00:21:54.792 --> 00:21:56.432
"Shit"? Why not dance with me.

189
00:21:56.632 --> 00:21:57.632
- Come on.
- I'm tired.


190
00:21:57.833 --> 00:22:00.952
- I need to sleep.
- Tired? Come on.


191
00:22:02.073 --> 00:22:03.473
No, no, no, no.

192
00:22:03.593 --> 00:22:06.512
I've been driving 18 hours.
Caesar...


193
00:22:07.512 --> 00:22:09.552
This is way too gay.

194
00:22:09.753 --> 00:22:13.033
What? Man, I'm getting
you ready for the ladies.


195
00:22:13.232 --> 00:22:15.813
Hey, you take advantage of my genius
while you have the chance,


196
00:22:15.953 --> 00:22:19.032
- because I am leaving tomorrow.
- Wait, what? Where are you going?


197
00:22:19.233 --> 00:22:20.332
New York!

198
00:22:20.512 --> 00:22:23.313
- And don't tell anybody.
- Why? What's in New York?


199
00:22:24.393 --> 00:22:26.272
A gallery owner is
interested in my work.


200
00:22:26.552 --> 00:22:28.913
And if anybody asks,
just tell them I stepped out.


201
00:22:29.113 --> 00:22:31.153
You stepped out... to New York?

202
00:22:31.352 --> 00:22:33.372
To do the laundry, get a cup of
coffee or something.


203
00:22:33.433 --> 00:22:35.713
Hey, no resistance.
You gotta lock your arms.


204
00:22:35.913 --> 00:22:37.753
I tell this to who exactly?

205
00:22:37.953 --> 00:22:39.893
You know the authorities.
Hey, you're too stiff.


206
00:22:39.993 --> 00:22:42.032
You gotta loosen up, like this.

207
00:22:42.233 --> 00:22:43.553
Wait!
You mean the police?


208
00:22:43.753 --> 00:22:46.552
Hey, no biggie.
Just tell them I'll be back.


209
00:22:46.753 --> 00:22:48.233
OK, good.

210
00:22:48.953 --> 00:22:51.813
Harlan, you forgot everything I taught you.
You dance like a white boy.


211
00:22:51.913 --> 00:22:53.753
That's because I am a white boy.
Wait, wait, wait.


212
00:22:53.753 --> 00:22:57.233
Where do you think you're going, eh?
I'm not done with you. You watch this.


213
00:23:00.513 --> 00:23:03.393
Oh, Harlan.
I'm sorry about your bag.


214
00:23:03.593 --> 00:23:05.753
That's not my bag.

215
00:23:10.873 --> 00:23:14.073
- That's some freaky shit.
- The whole thing was weird.


216
00:23:14.234 --> 00:23:16.473
Why would he put
his bag in my car?

217
00:23:16.673 --> 00:23:21.354
I don't know. Why don't you look inside?
Maybe he left you a note.


218
00:23:26.793 --> 00:23:28.634
A cigarette case...

219
00:23:30.394 --> 00:23:32.273
a lighter...

220
00:23:32.793 --> 00:23:35.833
Hey, all right.
Some cool shades.


221
00:23:36.034 --> 00:23:38.394
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.


222
00:23:38.914 --> 00:23:40.914
What do we have...?

223
00:23:41.713 --> 00:23:43.954
Vicodin!

224
00:23:44.313 --> 00:23:45.714
Is there a wallet?

225
00:23:45.914 --> 00:23:48.234
Man, better than a wallet.

226
00:23:48.433 --> 00:23:50.394
Oh wow, look at this.

227
00:23:52.273 --> 00:23:54.834
"Mamacita!"

228
00:23:57.554 --> 00:23:59.634
There's no wallet.

229
00:24:00.314 --> 00:24:02.834
- Hey, how about another, bad boy?
- No.


230
00:24:03.034 --> 00:24:06.034
- I think I'm gonna pass out now
- OK.


231
00:24:06.354 --> 00:24:07.794
You stay there.

232
00:24:08.634 --> 00:24:10.355
I party with you...

233
00:24:11.114 --> 00:24:12.874
I party without you.

234
00:24:30.394 --> 00:24:32.395
OK, Dwayne, get the shovels.

235
00:24:34.674 --> 00:24:35.995
What do you mean?

236
00:24:37.235 --> 00:24:39.674
What do you mean "what do I mean?
I mean, get the fucking shovels.


237
00:24:39.675 --> 00:24:41.015
I thought you were bringing them.

238
00:24:41.674 --> 00:24:44.595
I gave you 50 bucks cash
to pick them up.


239
00:24:44.794 --> 00:24:46.434
No, no, no, no.

240
00:24:46.635 --> 00:24:50.235
You asked me to pick up a sack
of adult dog food, joint formula.


241
00:24:50.434 --> 00:24:54.355
Some duct tape,
and trash bags with a drawstring top.


242
00:24:54.554 --> 00:24:55.955
And two shovels.

243
00:24:57.675 --> 00:24:58.955
I didn't hear the shovel part.

244
00:24:58.955 --> 00:25:01.514
And how are we supposed to
dig a fucking hole? With our teeth?


245
00:25:01.755 --> 00:25:03.675
I'm sorry, Al.

246
00:25:03.874 --> 00:25:05.634
- What time is it?
- A quarter to ten.


247
00:25:05.835 --> 00:25:07.395
Fuck! Fuck

248
00:25:07.595 --> 00:25:09.715
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Al, will you fucking relax!


249
00:25:09.915 --> 00:25:11.755
- Don't tell me to relax.
- You need to relax.


250
00:25:11.955 --> 00:25:12.422
No, no, no.

251
00:25:12.446 --> 00:25:14.646
I say we just dump the guy
and get the hell outta here.


252
00:25:14.715 --> 00:25:17.395
Are you out of your fucking mind?

253
00:25:17.595 --> 00:25:18.675
- No.
- No?


254
00:25:18.875 --> 00:25:24.115
So now you suggest that we just leave our little
friend lounging around here in the desert, right?


255
00:25:24.115 --> 00:25:26.115
- You know what? Forget it.
- No, no, no,  I don't wanna forget it.


256
00:25:26.115 --> 00:25:27.995
That's a great idea.
That's great. You know why?


257
00:25:28.195 --> 00:25:31.835
Because now we don't have to worry
about the forest ranger


258
00:25:31.995 --> 00:25:35.595
or his forensic fucks finding
a nose hair or a fur ball.


259
00:25:35.796 --> 00:25:39.955
'Cause you know why?
We've got a whole fucking body


260
00:25:40.155 --> 00:25:44.436
pointing his finger at,
guess which two assholes?! Huh?!


261
00:25:44.635 --> 00:25:46.076
All right, all right!

262
00:25:46.235 --> 00:25:47.515
All right!

263
00:25:47.675 --> 00:25:50.635
- It was a stupid fucking idea. Are you happy?
- No, no, no.


264
00:25:50.675 --> 00:25:52.116
Happy I am not.
No, no, no.


265
00:25:52.356 --> 00:25:55.796
So why don't you tell me
your brainiac idea.


266
00:25:55.995 --> 00:25:59.315
We go to a motel and
wait till hardware store opens up.


267
00:26:01.635 --> 00:26:03.516
- In the morning?
- Yeah.


268
00:26:04.156 --> 00:26:09.435
Because of you, partner,
we're gonna do this in broad fucking daylight.


269
00:26:09.916 --> 00:26:11.796
- That's so fucked!
- Yeah.


270
00:26:12.116 --> 00:26:13.555
Get in the car.

271
00:26:15.076 --> 00:26:16.676
Oh, fuck!

272
00:26:16.996 --> 00:26:18.916
- It's your fault.
- Yeah.


273
00:26:19.116 --> 00:26:22.836
You said, dog food,
the tape and fucking trash bags.


274
00:26:43.157 --> 00:26:45.436
Oh, God!

275
00:26:45.636 --> 00:26:48.436
- Hello?
- Jude? Is that you?


276
00:26:48.637 --> 00:26:52.317
Yes! Oh, that's it!

277
00:26:54.237 --> 00:26:56.557
Fuck you, you asshole!

278
00:27:04.196 --> 00:27:05.597
Caesar...

279
00:27:18.517 --> 00:27:20.916
I thought you were leaving in the morning.

280
00:27:24.357 --> 00:27:25.397
What time is it?

281
00:27:26.077 --> 00:27:27.157
It's a quarter to eight.

282
00:27:28.156 --> 00:27:30.076
Oh, God.

283
00:27:30.837 --> 00:27:32.597
Shit! I'm sorry.

284
00:27:33.197 --> 00:27:34.997
Why?

285
00:27:35.197 --> 00:27:36.257
I don't know.

286
00:27:39.917 --> 00:27:41.877
Still soggy...

287
00:27:48.677 --> 00:27:50.037
You want some coffee?

288
00:27:52.877 --> 00:27:54.758
Yes, please. Thank you.

289
00:27:55.357 --> 00:27:57.197
Espresso or latte!

290
00:27:57.917 --> 00:27:59.317
OK.

291
00:27:59.837 --> 00:28:01.437
Which one?

292
00:28:02.877 --> 00:28:04.557
Either one is fine with me.

293
00:28:05.477 --> 00:28:09.018
I think a latte.
I'm not quite sure you can...


294
00:28:09.077 --> 00:28:11.797
handle an espresso.

295
00:28:17.557 --> 00:28:19.798
I am Tuesday, by the way.

296
00:28:20.317 --> 00:28:21.878
Hi.

297
00:28:22.077 --> 00:28:26.357
- And you're Harlan from Wyoming.
- Yeah.


298
00:28:26.558 --> 00:28:28.797
"Like no place on Earth."

299
00:28:29.118 --> 00:28:32.598
That's our slogan.
For Wyoming.


300
00:28:33.358 --> 00:28:34.798
OK.

301
00:28:36.958 --> 00:28:39.438
Why don't you sit down?

302
00:28:45.117 --> 00:28:48.478
- Did you sleep all right last night?
- Oh yeah, great.


303
00:28:48.678 --> 00:28:51.838
It didn't get too noisy for you?

304
00:28:52.518 --> 00:28:54.278
Oh. Right...

305
00:28:54.478 --> 00:28:57.038
So, you're Caesar's girlfriend?

306
00:28:57.238 --> 00:28:58.998
No, we just have sex.

307
00:29:00.438 --> 00:29:04.038
I'm just kidding, OK.
My roommate Tina is the screamer.


308
00:29:04.238 --> 00:29:06.678
I just crashed over there last night.

309
00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:08.398
Tina took Caesar
to the airport this morning


310
00:29:08.399 --> 00:29:11.798
and I just hung around
to do some laundry.


311
00:29:20.719 --> 00:29:22.799
Hey, Harlan.

312
00:29:24.798 --> 00:29:27.358
Can I ask you a question?

313
00:29:27.918 --> 00:29:29.718
Uh, yeah.

314
00:29:30.838 --> 00:29:33.359
- Who cuts your hair?
- Super Cuts?


315
00:29:35.119 --> 00:29:37.278
Super Cuts.
Why?


316
00:29:37.879 --> 00:29:39.479
I am a hairstylist.

317
00:29:39.718 --> 00:29:41.078
- Really?
- Yeah.


318
00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:44.238
You should let me cut
your hair sometime.


319
00:29:44.679 --> 00:29:46.558
All right.

320
00:29:47.798 --> 00:29:50.118
Oh! Caesar left a note
for you on the fridge.


321
00:29:51.399 --> 00:29:53.919
- I think it's an audition.
- You're kidding?


322
00:29:54.118 --> 00:29:57.639
Yeah, I guess the regular guy
got deported or something.


323
00:29:57.839 --> 00:30:00.839
OK, so Caesar wanted
me to tell you to...

324
00:30:02.719 --> 00:30:04.279
make yourself at home,

325
00:30:04.479 --> 00:30:07.559
and have lots and lots of sex,

326
00:30:07.759 --> 00:30:11.159
and don't let anyone touch the paintings,
or he'll cut your balls off.


327
00:30:13.439 --> 00:30:15.799
It was really nice meeting you, Harlan.

328
00:30:16.919 --> 00:30:18.239
Thanks for the...

329
00:30:18.399 --> 00:30:19.839
coffee.

330
00:30:26.639 --> 00:30:29.239
Shit. The rain, huh?
I thought it never rains around here.


331
00:30:29.439 --> 00:30:32.080
- What time this hellhole open up anyway?
- 8 o'clock, Al.


332
00:30:32.279 --> 00:30:35.200
Al, I fucking told you

333
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.520
You're the most impatient motherfucker
on the planet, you know that?


334
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.999
What the fuck happened to the watch
I bought you last year for Christmas.


335
00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.340
Oh, again with the watch. I told you
I can't wear it. I'm allergic. I break out to...


336
00:30:45.439 --> 00:30:49.599
I just don't wear anything. Necklaces,
any of that stuff, OK. Have you noticed, no rings?


337
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.639
$3,000, later you tell me you don't wear a watch.
Fucking great!


338
00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:58.240
I'll give you a check. I use it at home.
I'll make it a clock.


339
00:30:58.439 --> 00:30:59.599
Oh, you will? Good.

340
00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.600
- Fucked up.
- Here's the guy, come on. Let's go.


341
00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.280
Hi.

342
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.160
We're technically not open yet.
I still need to go inside  and turn on the lights


343
00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.640
and the bar-code scanners, and
post the special papers.


344
00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:30.800
It'll be about another 15 minutes.
Sorry, but you're just gonna have to wait outside.


345
00:31:35.441 --> 00:31:37.361
Thank you for your patience.

346
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.921
Here. This is 9.99.
That's a cheap one.


347
00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.481
those kind break all the time.
You gotta find a sturdy one.


348
00:32:05.881 --> 00:32:09.401
- How's this?
- You don't want a handle. It's got a square nose.


349
00:32:09.601 --> 00:32:13.361
- You need a round nose shovel.
- Who gives a shit?


350
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.840
- Who gives a shit?
- OK.


351
00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.601
I don't know, I don't know.

352
00:32:22.401 --> 00:32:24.641
How's this, huh?
You get the whole kit.


353
00:32:24.801 --> 00:32:26.041
You get the rake,

354
00:32:26.241 --> 00:32:28.641
the shovel, and the hoe, for 29.99.

355
00:32:29.921 --> 00:32:31.361
Let me see this

356
00:32:34.281 --> 00:32:38.241
It's a good deal.
OK, we're done.


357
00:32:38.681 --> 00:32:40.481
Let's pay and get the hell outta here.

358
00:32:41.921 --> 00:32:43.482
Un-fucking-believable.

359
00:33:01.442 --> 00:33:04.241
What's up, fool?
You look a little lost?


360
00:33:04.641 --> 00:33:06.681
You sure you're in
the right neighborhood, ese?


361
00:33:07.322 --> 00:33:08.962
I think so.

362
00:33:09.441 --> 00:33:12.041
You better know so, wonderbread.

363
00:33:42.762 --> 00:33:44.922
You gotta be kidding me.

364
00:33:58.122 --> 00:33:59.522
Hi.

365
00:34:00.642 --> 00:34:03.802
- That's a nice car you got there.
- I know.


366
00:34:04.803 --> 00:34:07.403
So, you're here for the audition?

367
00:34:07.602 --> 00:34:11.282
Do I look like I'm here for an audition?
I live right there.


368
00:34:12.203 --> 00:34:14.563
- What's up?
- Everything is fine. You?


369
00:34:14.762 --> 00:34:16.922
There are.
Yes.


370
00:34:17.123 --> 00:34:18.523
You wanna audition,
talk to Johnny.


371
00:34:18.722 --> 00:34:21.042
Hi. I am Harlan Woodriff.
I'm sorry I'm late.


372
00:34:21.243 --> 00:34:24.842
For some reason I thought you were
in Bel Air. You know, Bel Air, Terrace Drive.


373
00:34:24.843 --> 00:34:27.922
Obviously this is a completely
different neighborhood.


374
00:34:28.123 --> 00:34:33.723
It's nice and all, colorful.
No not you guys. The houses.


375
00:34:34.362 --> 00:34:36.043
What did he say?

376
00:34:36.242 --> 00:34:39.443
He wants to play with you.

377
00:34:39.883 --> 00:34:40.922
Right.

378
00:34:41.123 --> 00:34:43.723
I'll just get my stuff.

379
00:34:49.682 --> 00:34:54.243
- Look, Al. He woke up.
- Good morning, sunshine


380
00:34:54.643 --> 00:34:57.123
Why don't you come out
so we can ask you a few questions?


381
00:35:01.443 --> 00:35:03.923
Against the car so
I can to talk him.

382
00:35:04.123 --> 00:35:06.363
All right, sunshine.

383
00:35:09.683 --> 00:35:13.523
Dwayne, Dwayne,
why all the hostility?


384
00:35:13.923 --> 00:35:16.763
Look what you did to him.
Can't you see that our friend


385
00:35:16.964 --> 00:35:20.163
wants to be cooperative? Right?

386
00:35:20.363 --> 00:35:22.044
- Right.
- Yeah.


387
00:35:22.483 --> 00:35:24.764
Dwayne, grab the shovel and start digging.

388
00:35:24.963 --> 00:35:26.243
Why the fuck do I have to dig?

389
00:35:26.243 --> 00:35:29.323
Because you shot the designated digger.

390
00:35:32.523 --> 00:35:34.723
Are you all right, you okay?

391
00:35:34.924 --> 00:35:36.523
- Yeah.
- Good.


392
00:35:37.404 --> 00:35:39.964
All right, this is simple.

393
00:35:40.244 --> 00:35:42.204
Our employer would like you to return
what you took from him


394
00:35:42.403 --> 00:35:46.404
or pay the aggregate of

395
00:35:47.084 --> 00:35:51.163
- I got the stuff.
- Yeah, we know that, but where is it?


396
00:35:51.924 --> 00:35:53.524
If I tell you, you're gonna kill me.

397
00:35:53.724 --> 00:35:57.164
Yeah, and if you don't tell me I'm gonna
torture you till you do and then I'm gonna kill you


398
00:35:57.164 --> 00:36:01.244
So why don't we just get this over with,
and you can get on with your afterlife.


399
00:36:03.604 --> 00:36:08.924
If you could please take the gun out of my eye,
I maybe would be able to think more clearly.


400
00:36:13.604 --> 00:36:15.044
So?

401
00:36:15.444 --> 00:36:17.404
I'm waiting.

402
00:36:20.684 --> 00:36:22.924
Does he have to keep doing that?

403
00:36:24.244 --> 00:36:25.724
Dwayne, stop the digging..

404
00:36:26.004 --> 00:36:27.364
What?

405
00:36:27.524 --> 00:36:29.444
Stop fucking digging.

406
00:36:38.404 --> 00:36:40.684
All right.
Is that better?


407
00:36:42.565 --> 00:36:44.524
A little.

408
00:36:45.884 --> 00:36:48.285
This...

409
00:36:48.484 --> 00:36:50.524
this is, it's all...

410
00:36:50.964 --> 00:36:52.644
theatrics.

411
00:36:53.964 --> 00:36:57.885
We're not gonna kill you.
Dwayne?


412
00:37:00.245 --> 00:37:02.925
I thought... Good job...

413
00:37:03.365 --> 00:37:08.004
Look, why don't you just tell us where the
merchandise is, and we'll drive you back into town.


414
00:37:15.445 --> 00:37:17.004
It's in my bag.

415
00:37:17.885 --> 00:37:19.365
And where might that be?

416
00:37:21.524 --> 00:37:23.565
I put it in that kid's car

417
00:37:23.765 --> 00:37:26.165
Back at Rasor Road.

418
00:37:28.885 --> 00:37:32.205
You mean the twerp
from the diner?


419
00:37:33.125 --> 00:37:36.565
Yeah.
I can take you to him.


420
00:37:44.165 --> 00:37:45.405
What the fuck?

421
00:37:45.605 --> 00:37:51.006
Wyoming license plate.

422
00:38:05.885 --> 00:38:08.566
All right.
I'm ready.


423
00:38:11.205 --> 00:38:13.805
He wants to know what
song you wanna play.


424
00:38:14.605 --> 00:38:15.886
How about "Mi Salsa?"

425
00:38:20.766 --> 00:38:23.726
This is gonna be one short ass audition,
I'll tell you that much.


426
00:38:23.926 --> 00:38:25.286
Go ahead, man.
Do "Mi Salsa", dog.


427
00:38:25.926 --> 00:38:27.645
Go ahead, man.

428
00:38:27.846 --> 00:38:30.286
Will you shut up and let him play?

429
00:38:31.526 --> 00:38:32.566
OK.

430
00:39:34.326 --> 00:39:35.607
Sorry.

431
00:39:40.206 --> 00:39:43.607
Hey, homes. You did good.
Till you fucked up the end of the song.


432
00:39:43.807 --> 00:39:45.607
What can I say.
I sucked.


433
00:39:52.167 --> 00:39:54.567
Johnny says you got a lot of
flavor for a white boy.


434
00:39:54.767 --> 00:39:55.767
- He did?
- Yeah.


435
00:39:55.967 --> 00:39:57.888
He also said you move like shit.

436
00:40:04.967 --> 00:40:08.327
He want you to watch that tape
and practice... a lot.


437
00:40:08.527 --> 00:40:10.647
All right.

438
00:40:13.768 --> 00:40:17.447
His mother also wants you
to try some of her homemade Tamales.


439
00:40:17.888 --> 00:40:19.808
Gracias.

440
00:40:41.647 --> 00:40:43.167
Hi.

441
00:40:49.207 --> 00:40:51.048
Can I give you a hand there?

442
00:40:53.608 --> 00:40:56.008
Thank you, but I got it.

443
00:41:00.448 --> 00:41:02.568
What about this back window?

444
00:41:02.888 --> 00:41:05.128
I'm coming back out.

445
00:41:07.368 --> 00:41:10.288
You know, officer. I got it,
you really don't have to do that.


446
00:41:10.488 --> 00:41:12.128
It's no problem.

447
00:41:29.288 --> 00:41:31.648
Is there something
I can do for you, officer?


448
00:41:31.848 --> 00:41:34.608
I'm looking for Caesar.
Is he around?


449
00:41:34.808 --> 00:41:37.408
No, he stepped out.

450
00:41:39.369 --> 00:41:41.728
Do you know when he'll be back?

451
00:41:42.888 --> 00:41:45.488
I couldn't really say.

452
00:41:45.769 --> 00:41:47.889
Are you a family member?

453
00:41:49.489 --> 00:41:51.768
Not exactly.

454
00:41:51.969 --> 00:41:53.528
His roommate?

455
00:41:53.729 --> 00:41:56.128
Kinda.
I just got into town.


456
00:42:02.969 --> 00:42:05.809
Can I give Caesar a message for you?

457
00:42:06.008 --> 00:42:09.079
I found a personal effect of his.
It slipped through the cracks.


458
00:42:09.079 --> 00:42:12.713
I'm sorry?

459
00:42:13.089 --> 00:42:15.569
Nipple ring.

460
00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:18.849
Well, I'd be happy to

461
00:42:19.049 --> 00:42:22.069
- give that to Caesar on your behalf...
- I'm afraid that's not possible.


462
00:42:22.689 --> 00:42:25.129
He has to sign for it... personally.

463
00:42:28.169 --> 00:42:29.409
OK.

464
00:42:34.329 --> 00:42:36.290
I used to play
clarinet in a band.


465
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:40.010
That's nice. Clarinet.

466
00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:43.690
I have some time.
Do you mind if I come in and wait?


467
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:48.529
Actually, I don't think Caesar
will be home for a while.


468
00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:55.449
In that case I'll just swing by later.

469
00:42:58.169 --> 00:42:59.929
All right.

470
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:02.809
Bye.

471
00:44:18.571 --> 00:44:20.491
Hello?

472
00:44:21.771 --> 00:44:23.211
Who is this?

473
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.811
- Harlan.
- Oh hi, Harlan...


474
00:44:27.131 --> 00:44:29.171
why are you answering
Jude's phone?


475
00:44:29.371 --> 00:44:33.131
- He left his bag in my car.
- How did that happen?


476
00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:35.771
I have no idea.
It was some sort of mistake.


477
00:44:37.051 --> 00:44:39.371
- I don't believe you.
- Why not?


478
00:44:39.571 --> 00:44:42.211
Because Jude doesn't make mistakes.

479
00:44:42.731 --> 00:44:46.331
Well, clearly he confused his
silver Fastback with my two tone Chevy.


480
00:44:46.571 --> 00:44:51.051
Listen here, you little shit. You tell Jude
he can't fuck with me.


481
00:44:51.371 --> 00:44:55.011
I want my cut and I'm not gonna
fuckin' wait for it. You tell him that.


482
00:44:55.731 --> 00:44:58.491
Look, I have no idea
what you're talking about.


483
00:44:58.691 --> 00:45:01.451
So I'll just let you
tell him that yourself.


484
00:45:01.651 --> 00:45:03.811
In the meantime, can you
tell Jude, if you speak to him


485
00:45:04.012 --> 00:45:07.011
before I do, that I'm gonna leave
his bag at the Venice police station,


486
00:45:07.211 --> 00:45:09.411
and he can pick it
up in the morning. All right?


487
00:45:09.851 --> 00:45:12.891
Take care. Goodbye.

488
00:45:35.331 --> 00:45:36.652
Ooh, nice ass.

489
00:45:40.691 --> 00:45:41.932
- Hi.
- Hi.


490
00:45:42.132 --> 00:45:44.091
Caesar asked me
to water his plants.


491
00:45:44.292 --> 00:45:45.972
Oh, OK.

492
00:45:46.412 --> 00:45:48.332
How did your audition go?

493
00:45:48.532 --> 00:45:52.212
Good... Kinda... I think.

494
00:45:52.412 --> 00:45:56.652
Good. Sounds kinda positive.
Sort of.


495
00:45:57.532 --> 00:46:02.452
You know, it's a good thing you're here,
'cause that cactus is hanging on by a thread.


496
00:46:17.452 --> 00:46:19.292
OK, this way.

497
00:46:20.973 --> 00:46:23.092
Come on.

498
00:46:24.212 --> 00:46:26.853
Come on, come on.
This way.


499
00:46:31.892 --> 00:46:35.373
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yup.


500
00:46:36.173 --> 00:46:40.772
Wow! I guess Caesar was really
paying attention in agriculture class.


501
00:46:40.973 --> 00:46:42.213
Pretty amazing, huh?

502
00:46:42.733 --> 00:46:46.053
Yeah, I'm speechless.

503
00:46:47.293 --> 00:46:50.933
It's not like Caesar is a
drug dealer or anything.


504
00:46:51.213 --> 00:46:53.533
He just sells it to a
few close friends and...


505
00:46:53.932 --> 00:46:56.133
... some people with doctor's prescriptions .

506
00:46:56.333 --> 00:46:58.733
So, what, he's like a rogue pharmacist?

507
00:46:59.213 --> 00:47:00.653
Yeah, basically.

508
00:47:03.133 --> 00:47:04.773
A cop came by today.

509
00:47:04.973 --> 00:47:07.133
- Officer Sternfield?
- Yeah.


510
00:47:07.333 --> 00:47:08.813
- I didn't let him in.
- Good.


511
00:47:09.013 --> 00:47:13.613
He's the cop that busted Caesar for
painting pubic hair on a statue at Muscle Beach.


512
00:47:13.773 --> 00:47:16.814
Does he suspect Caesar's
horticultural activities?


513
00:47:17.173 --> 00:47:19.213
I think he has ulterior motives.

514
00:47:20.013 --> 00:47:22.253
Like what?

515
00:47:24.933 --> 00:47:28.174
Don't worry, Caesar's not gonna
bend over and crack a smile for no man.


516
00:47:29.093 --> 00:47:31.894
Even if he is in a uniform.

517
00:47:36.333 --> 00:47:42.014
- Are you always this jumpy?
- Yes. No. It's just...


518
00:47:42.974 --> 00:47:45.574
I think I know what you need.

519
00:47:57.374 --> 00:47:59.394
Now, I don't know what kind
of weed they grow in Wyoming


520
00:47:59.493 --> 00:48:04.173
but I guarantee Caesar's
weed will kick their ass.


521
00:48:04.374 --> 00:48:07.214
So you might wanna
take it a little easy.

522
00:48:14.174 --> 00:48:16.134
That wasn't so bad.

523
00:48:17.014 --> 00:48:21.294
Yeah, they don't grow weed
like this in Yuma either.


524
00:48:21.774 --> 00:48:23.774
You're from Yuma?

525
00:48:25.774 --> 00:48:27.334
Yeah.

526
00:48:33.734 --> 00:48:35.974
I'm never going back.

527
00:48:43.094 --> 00:48:45.174
Tell me about Wyoming.

528
00:48:47.574 --> 00:48:52.614
Well... it's the least
populated state in the country


529
00:48:53.174 --> 00:48:55.774
Really? I didn't know that.

530
00:49:00.175 --> 00:49:02.375
Is it beautiful?

531
00:49:02.574 --> 00:49:05.255
Yeah, it is beautiful.

532
00:49:05.494 --> 00:49:09.415
There are these endless golden plains
as far as you can see.


533
00:49:09.854 --> 00:49:13.215
Velvet green fields of alfalfa.

534
00:49:13.414 --> 00:49:17.735
Antelopes, migrating across
the open range by the thousands.


535
00:49:19.015 --> 00:49:20.535
There's lot of cows.

536
00:49:21.055 --> 00:49:24.934
Lots of deer.
Lots of assholes in camouflage


537
00:49:25.135 --> 00:49:29.535
on ATVs lurking in the bushes
with their sniper rifles.


538
00:49:29.975 --> 00:49:31.774
It's a nice place to raise a family,

539
00:49:31.815 --> 00:49:36.655
but anything hopping, feathered
or furred is pretty much fucked.


540
00:49:46.335 --> 00:49:48.855
Harlan, are you okay?

541
00:49:49.295 --> 00:49:52.563
Just... just breathe,
breathe, breathe.


542
00:49:52.563 --> 00:49:54.187
I can't.

543
00:49:55.376 --> 00:49:57.935
Come on, Harlan.

544
00:49:58.215 --> 00:50:03.856
OK, not that much.
Just try to calm down.


545
00:50:06.616 --> 00:50:10.456
- What are you doing?
- I gotta go.


546
00:50:10.655 --> 00:50:12.496
Where are you going?

547
00:50:14.416 --> 00:50:15.815
Oh my God!

548
00:50:16.535 --> 00:50:18.536
- My heart.
- What's wrong with your heart?


549
00:50:20.495 --> 00:50:22.256
- Did you see that?!
- What?!


550
00:50:22.575 --> 00:50:25.175
My heart.
Oh, it's going.


551
00:50:25.376 --> 00:50:28.575
Oh, my God! It's... it's beating
out of my chest. Oh shit!


552
00:50:28.776 --> 00:50:31.055
It's zig-zagging
I can feel it in my temple, boom boom..


553
00:50:31.216 --> 00:50:32.756
It's going around and around...
My trachea is closing.


554
00:50:32.816 --> 00:50:35.175
Oh, my god.
I can hear it my head!


555
00:50:35.536 --> 00:50:39.296
I'm having a heart attack.
I'm having a heart attack. Fuck me!


556
00:50:41.136 --> 00:50:42.416
I think I'm having a heart attack..

557
00:50:42.416 --> 00:50:46.736
You're not having a heart attack, Harlan.
Just try to calm down.


558
00:50:49.976 --> 00:50:53.056
- You're gonna be fine.
- I am?


559
00:50:53.616 --> 00:50:58.456
- Yeah. You're gonna be fine.
- You're right. You're right, I'm...


560
00:50:58.896 --> 00:51:01.016
I'm feeling better.

561
00:51:01.216 --> 00:51:04.296
I feel... I feel better.

562
00:51:06.736 --> 00:51:09.256
Harlan?
Oh shit!


563
00:52:01.297 --> 00:52:03.337
He's experiencing chest pains,
shortness of breath.


564
00:52:03.977 --> 00:52:05.137
It's all right.

565
00:52:06.737 --> 00:52:08.217
Doctor, do I know you?

566
00:52:09.577 --> 00:52:10.497
Am I dying?

567
00:52:10.737 --> 00:52:12.638
No, you're not dying. Just calm down.
What's your name?


568
00:52:12.737 --> 00:52:14.297
Harlan Woodriff.

569
00:52:14.937 --> 00:52:17.097
- Are you his wife?
- No, I'm Tuesday.


570
00:52:17.297 --> 00:52:19.078
- Tuesday, you're gonna have to wait out here.
- No, no!


571
00:52:19.177 --> 00:52:22.017
- Sir, please stay in the gurney.
- Harlan, let go of her hand.


572
00:52:22.217 --> 00:52:24.297
Harlan, I'll be right here
waiting for you.


573
00:52:24.497 --> 00:52:26.977
Let go of her hand, Harlan.
Let go.


574
00:52:27.178 --> 00:52:28.737
All right, let's get him in 2.

575
00:52:54.537 --> 00:52:56.218
Excuse me, can I help you?

576
00:52:56.418 --> 00:52:57.458
Oh, Reverend Harvey.

577
00:52:57.658 --> 00:53:00.538
- I'm here to give last rights.
- Yes, for the drug overdose.


578
00:53:01.898 --> 00:53:04.338
Nurse!
Nurse!


579
00:53:04.537 --> 00:53:05.617
Nurse!

580
00:53:05.658 --> 00:53:08.258
- Sir, I need an update.
- I don't work here.


581
00:53:09.138 --> 00:53:10.178
Doctor!

582
00:53:11.618 --> 00:53:14.698
- Is Harlan all right?
- Oh yeah, he's fine.


583
00:53:14.998 --> 00:53:18.798
- Was it a heart attack?
- No. Panic attack. Excuse me.


584
00:53:23.319 --> 00:53:24.422
Yee haw.

585
00:53:27.019 --> 00:53:30.859
You know, you're a fine looking man.
You must be important.


586
00:53:31.539 --> 00:53:35.458
Funny. Well look, I'm glad
I have your vote of confidence.


587
00:53:35.978 --> 00:53:39.499
Tuesday, hey,
Can you give ...?


588
00:53:39.858 --> 00:53:42.578
Can you give this gentleman a tip?
He is one cool motherfucker.


589
00:53:42.779 --> 00:53:45.939
No, that's all right. We are not allowed
to take tips. That's cool though.


590
00:53:46.138 --> 00:53:50.059
What? Well, that's bullshit.
I wanna pay him anyway.


591
00:53:50.258 --> 00:53:54.058
- Harlan, get in the car.
- What? I like him.


592
00:53:54.259 --> 00:53:56.599
You know, you should come over
and hang out with us sometime.


593
00:53:56.698 --> 00:54:00.139
Yeah, I'd do that. Just give me a call,
we'll hook it up, we'll hang out.


594
00:54:00.339 --> 00:54:02.379
You know, do all that.
No problem.


595
00:54:03.699 --> 00:54:05.759
The Valium should wear off in a little while.
He'll be all right.


596
00:54:05.858 --> 00:54:07.259
OK.

597
00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:11.379
You know, Tuesday can
I tell you something?


598
00:54:12.858 --> 00:54:14.299
You're a beautiful woman.

599
00:54:15.339 --> 00:54:17.259
- You think so?
- Yeah.


600
00:54:17.659 --> 00:54:21.739
- Isn't she hot?
- Damn! You got that right.


601
00:54:21.939 --> 00:54:24.579
Anyway, bro. You be good, take care.
I'll holla.


602
00:54:26.619 --> 00:54:28.579
Anyway. Peace. Cool, later.

603
00:54:29.139 --> 00:54:30.859
Later.

604
00:54:40.779 --> 00:54:42.259
Harlan!

605
00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:49.939
- Can you stay a while?
- Yeah, I think that would be a great idea.


606
00:54:50.099 --> 00:54:51.159
All right.

607
00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:55.099
Home sweet home.

608
00:54:55.419 --> 00:54:58.139
I am starving.

609
00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:02.620
Me too.
Is any there food in this house?


610
00:55:02.899 --> 00:55:06.219
We have a lifetime supply of my
mothers's kicking corn relish.


611
00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.780
That sounds good.

612
00:55:07.979 --> 00:55:11.019
What do we have here?
Tamales.


613
00:55:11.419 --> 00:55:14.780
Johnny's mother's homemade tamales.
She wanted me to try them.


614
00:55:14.979 --> 00:55:18.380
You've been in LA
for all of 24 hours

615
00:55:18.579 --> 00:55:21.500
and you already have
mothers cooking for you?


616
00:55:21.699 --> 00:55:25.100
Yeah! That's 'cause I'm Harlan.
Like no man on earth.


617
00:55:25.539 --> 00:55:27.820
Yes, you are.

618
00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:43.980
I'm sorry... about tonight.

619
00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:46.680
- I really wasn't one of my better ideas.
- Don't be ridiculous.


620
00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:49.140
I am responsible for my
own idiosyncrasies.


621
00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:51.820
You scared the shit out of me.

622
00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:54.780
I'm sorry.

623
00:56:02.701 --> 00:56:04.980
Would you open this for me?

624
00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:07.140
- Sure.
- Thank you.


625
00:56:26.781 --> 00:56:29.101
You know... I'll open that.

626
00:56:29.301 --> 00:56:31.501
- I got it.
- It's OK. Let go.


627
00:56:31.701 --> 00:56:32.661
All right.

628
00:56:33.141 --> 00:56:39.181
I'm just gonna make dinner...
and you go... sit... there ... Now.


629
00:56:58.581 --> 00:57:00.381
Just a moment, please.

630
00:57:03.141 --> 00:57:05.541
So, what's up with
your friend at the DMV?

631
00:57:05.781 --> 00:57:06.781
What do you mean?

632
00:57:06.781 --> 00:57:09.660
I gave him this kid's license plate number,
and he's gonna call us back.


633
00:57:09.661 --> 00:57:13.701
When? We've been sitting with our thumbs
up our asses for the last three hours.


634
00:57:14.142 --> 00:57:17.461
Welcome to Big Burger.
Will you be dining in your car this evening?


635
00:57:17.461 --> 00:57:19.090
Yes, thank you.

636
00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:22.580
You know waiting doesn't
sit well with me, OK. You know that.


637
00:57:22.581 --> 00:57:26.541
Call your friend back
and tell him to move his ass, all right.


638
00:57:26.742 --> 00:57:29.421
- May I take your order?
- Yes.


639
00:57:29.622 --> 00:57:32.981
Two double cheeseburger...
Ooh, you want fries? They make them fresh.


640
00:57:33.182 --> 00:57:36.261
No, I'm going easy on the carbs.
I'll take a diet root beer.


641
00:57:37.381 --> 00:57:40.181
- They don't have diet root beer.
- Then water with a slice of lemon.


642
00:57:42.581 --> 00:57:46.102
Let me get two double cheeseburgers,
a large fry


643
00:57:46.301 --> 00:57:48.502
strawberry shake,

644
00:57:48.822 --> 00:57:54.822
and water with a slice of lemon
for my fat-free friend.


645
00:57:56.342 --> 00:57:58.102
Here you go.

646
00:57:58.302 --> 00:57:59.942
That was fast.

647
00:58:02.722 --> 00:58:06.844
I'd offer you a beer but I think
maybe you've had enough for one night.


648
00:58:07.068 --> 00:58:08.668
Yeah.

649
00:58:10.262 --> 00:58:13.982
You know, I don't think
I've ever seen a real tamale before.


650
00:58:14.702 --> 00:58:17.462
Is it supposed to be this stiff?

651
00:58:31.582 --> 00:58:32.782
Good?

652
00:58:33.782 --> 00:58:35.822
It's hot, but I like it.

653
00:58:38.262 --> 00:58:41.943
So, Tex. You seem like
you're feeling a little better.


654
00:58:42.702 --> 00:58:44.223
Much better.

655
00:58:47.143 --> 00:58:50.023
- Tuesday?
- Yes, Harlan.


656
00:58:51.862 --> 00:58:55.183
Can you pass the relish?

657
00:58:55.383 --> 00:58:56.743
Sure.

658
00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:01.823
Anything else?

659
00:59:03.222 --> 00:59:05.103
Yeah.

660
00:59:07.622 --> 00:59:08.903
Can I kiss you?

661
00:59:09.463 --> 00:59:12.142
I hate it when guys have to ask.

662
01:01:09.785 --> 01:01:11.904
These are giving me traumatic
childhood flashbacks,


663
01:01:12.464 --> 01:01:14.585
- Why?
- Camouflage.


664
01:01:16.304 --> 01:01:18.305
I have to take them off.

665
01:01:18.624 --> 01:01:20.544
Go for it.

666
01:02:28.506 --> 01:02:29.465
Hello?

667
01:02:29.466 --> 01:02:31.465
Harlan.
Is that you?


668
01:02:32.425 --> 01:02:35.626
Hi, Mom.
What time is it?


669
01:02:35.825 --> 01:02:37.465
I don't know ...

670
01:02:37.666 --> 01:02:39.186
but I have some good news.

671
01:02:39.866 --> 01:02:41.386
Oh no!

672
01:02:42.106 --> 01:02:43.126
Honey,

673
01:02:43.225 --> 01:02:45.906
You have won a cruise.

674
01:02:46.426 --> 01:02:49.306
- I did?
- Yes, isn't it wonderful?


675
01:02:49.826 --> 01:02:51.066
It's a miracle!

676
01:02:51.546 --> 01:02:53.105
How?

677
01:02:53.306 --> 01:02:55.066
I don't know.
Does it really matter?


678
01:02:55.506 --> 01:02:57.546
They have a 24 hour

679
01:02:57.746 --> 01:02:58.786
all you can eat...

680
01:02:58.986 --> 01:03:01.226
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, Mom.


681
01:03:01.466 --> 01:03:04.106
And a champagne send-off.

682
01:03:04.306 --> 01:03:08.586
I gave them Caesar's address and they're
gonna come by and give you all the details.


683
01:03:08.986 --> 01:03:11.586
They have a jacuzzi. 
You know, bubbles.

684
01:03:12.666 --> 01:03:15.146
Honey, your grandfather really wants to go.

685
01:03:15.346 --> 01:03:16.746
I'm not getting too excited.

686
01:03:18.747 --> 01:03:21.426
It's probably just one of those scams
to get us to buy a condo.


687
01:03:21.627 --> 01:03:24.386
Oh, I do not know. The man on
the phone sounded very serious.


688
01:03:24.586 --> 01:03:27.507
- Very, very sincere.
- I think he was sincere.


689
01:03:28.187 --> 01:03:32.147
Mom, I'm sorry, but I'm really,
really late for a band rehearsal.


690
01:03:32.466 --> 01:03:35.786
Oh, a rehearsal? How wonderful.
Harlan is already in a band.


691
01:03:36.027 --> 01:03:37.546
Oh, well. Whoop de doo.

692
01:03:38.946 --> 01:03:40.146
How are you and grandpa doing?

693
01:03:40.347 --> 01:03:42.587
- We're fine, dear.
- That's good.


694
01:03:42.786 --> 01:03:45.546
Mom, I'm sorry.
I'll call you later, OK?


695
01:03:45.747 --> 01:03:49.226
We love you. And don't forget to
take your glucosamine.


696
01:03:49.786 --> 01:03:52.147
All right, Mom,
I won't. Bye..


697
01:04:08.107 --> 01:04:09.647
No, no, no.
Don't get up, don't get up.


698
01:04:10.027 --> 01:04:14.507
I have to run to band rehearsal
for a couple of hours. Will you wait for me?


699
01:04:14.907 --> 01:04:16.387
Yeah.

700
01:04:17.707 --> 01:04:20.107
I'll take you to the beach
when you get back.


701
01:04:20.827 --> 01:04:22.388
Do you have a bikini?

702
01:04:23.307 --> 01:04:26.587
No, but I can improvise.

703
01:04:27.188 --> 01:04:29.547
I bet you can.

704
01:04:33.068 --> 01:04:34.827
I'm late.

705
01:04:35.668 --> 01:04:37.868
Really late.
Really late.


706
01:04:53.748 --> 01:04:55.028
Shit.

707
01:05:06.707 --> 01:05:08.308
Hey, white boy.
What's up?


708
01:05:08.507 --> 01:05:09.587
Hi, Alex.
Hi, guys.


709
01:05:09.788 --> 01:05:11.408
Hey, you better move your ass.
Johnny's waiting.


710
01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:13.628
I'm moving as fast as I can.

711
01:05:14.948 --> 01:05:16.188
Get back to work.

712
01:05:23.348 --> 01:05:25.988
Hi, guys.
Sorry I'm late.


713
01:05:29.908 --> 01:05:34.468
- The tamale were delicious.
- Thank you. You're a good guy.


714
01:05:40.508 --> 01:05:42.508
Ready?

715
01:06:15.389 --> 01:06:16.749
Who is it?

716
01:06:17.748 --> 01:06:19.548
It's Bill Holmes.

717
01:06:20.228 --> 01:06:21.709
Who?

718
01:06:22.028 --> 01:06:25.428
Bill Holmes.
With Happy Time Cruise Lines.


719
01:06:34.269 --> 01:06:36.629
Hello, miss.
How are you this morning?


720
01:06:36.989 --> 01:06:39.549
I'm sorry, who are you looking for?

721
01:06:41.749 --> 01:06:43.389
Harlan Woodrif, ma’am.

722
01:06:44.469 --> 01:06:47.510
He's not here right now.
Why don't you come back later.


723
01:06:47.869 --> 01:06:50.069
No, I think we'll come in right now.

724
01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:15.190
Johnny! Johnny, come here.

725
01:07:15.389 --> 01:07:16.950
Five minutes.

726
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:23.830
What's going on?

727
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:25.750
Mama's spicy today.

728
01:07:27.790 --> 01:07:30.270
Yeah, I can see that.
But what is she saying?


729
01:07:31.709 --> 01:07:34.254
Johnny is not too impressed with your dancing.
What happened, foo'?


730
01:07:34.254 --> 01:07:35.548
Didn't you practice that tape?

731
01:07:35.549 --> 01:07:37.790
Yeah. I kinda had a rough night.

732
01:07:40.869 --> 01:07:45.469
Anyway, mama says to hell with the
flashy moves when you can play with your heart.


733
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:47.350
But Johnny just told her to butt out.

734
01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:50.630
Oh! He just said a bad word.

735
01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:55.110
She just said one too.

736
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:58.030
But it's mama's garage,
so Johnny loses.


737
01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:03.070
He's gonna put you in the band.

738
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:09.671
- Bueno.
- Bueno.


739
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:11.311
"Bueno," what?

740
01:08:11.550 --> 01:08:14.591
Welcome to the
Johnny Polanco band, my friend.


741
01:08:26.911 --> 01:08:28.630
Oh shit!

742
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:53.030
Holy shit!

743
01:08:55.391 --> 01:08:57.151
Tuesday.

744
01:09:03.111 --> 01:09:04.111
Oh God.

745
01:09:13.751 --> 01:09:15.232
Tuesday?

746
01:09:27.871 --> 01:09:29.752
- Hello?
- Hey, asshole.


747
01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:32.952
I went down to the Venice police station
and you didn't turn in the bag.


748
01:09:33.192 --> 01:09:36.151
Screw the bag.
I wanna know where Tuesday is.


749
01:09:36.472 --> 01:09:37.471
Who's Tuesday?

750
01:09:39.232 --> 01:09:40.671
She's a friend.

751
01:09:43.111 --> 01:09:44.552
Fuck me!

752
01:09:44.751 --> 01:09:45.991
What's the matter, Harlan?

753
01:09:47.992 --> 01:09:49.391
They've taken her.

754
01:09:55.632 --> 01:09:57.272
What?

755
01:09:58.832 --> 01:10:00.952
- Al, what the fuck?
- You're being a prick.


756
01:10:01.152 --> 01:10:04.752
- Well, I don't like her tone.
- Just let the lady talk.


757
01:10:07.552 --> 01:10:09.672
I...

758
01:10:10.432 --> 01:10:14.392
I think you might be after
the wrong guy.


759
01:10:15.272 --> 01:10:16.952
Really?

760
01:10:18.352 --> 01:10:20.592
What do you think?

761
01:10:20.792 --> 01:10:24.112
Dwayne, do you think
we have the wrong guy?


762
01:10:26.112 --> 01:10:28.352
I think she's full of shit.

763
01:10:28.552 --> 01:10:29.872
I gotta take a piss.

764
01:10:39.552 --> 01:10:41.568
Can I ask you a question?

765
01:10:41.668 --> 01:10:43.077
Huh?

766
01:10:45.313 --> 01:10:46.512
Yeah.

767
01:10:47.992 --> 01:10:49.912
Who cuts your hair?

768
01:10:57.953 --> 01:10:59.792
Hi, I'm Riley.

769
01:11:01.032 --> 01:11:02.873
Where is the bag?

770
01:11:03.352 --> 01:11:05.033
It's on the table.

771
01:11:20.793 --> 01:11:22.073
Where is the lighter?

772
01:11:22.553 --> 01:11:24.633
- What lighter?
- Silver Zippo,


773
01:11:24.833 --> 01:11:27.433
with a Royal Flush engraved on the side.

774
01:11:30.873 --> 01:11:33.113
- It's them
- Tell them you have what they want.


775
01:11:34.353 --> 01:11:37.033
Hold on!
We never talked. Got it?


776
01:11:37.233 --> 01:11:38.553
I have to answer this.

777
01:11:40.193 --> 01:11:41.113
Hello?

778
01:11:41.994 --> 01:11:43.033
Yo, brother.

779
01:11:44.313 --> 01:11:45.033
Caesar?

780
01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:48.273
Yeah, remember me? I gave you
my house, my bed, my tequila.


781
01:11:48.473 --> 01:11:50.074
I hope you're taking advantage of it.

782
01:11:50.313 --> 01:11:52.793
Sure, sure.
Are you still in New York?


783
01:11:53.153 --> 01:11:55.954
Yeah. Times Square is a drag.
They closed down all the strip clubs.


784
01:11:56.273 --> 01:11:58.434
That's uh... That's too bad.

785
01:11:59.554 --> 01:12:05.014
Hey, are you banging some chick or farm animal,
or something? You sound a little distracted.


786
01:12:08.753 --> 01:12:10.673
It's busy.

787
01:12:16.114 --> 01:12:19.914
Your faggot ass friend
better not be calling the cops,


788
01:12:20.234 --> 01:12:22.913
or that's the last head of
hair you'll cut.


789
01:12:26.593 --> 01:12:28.793
Dwayne,

790
01:12:28.994 --> 01:12:32.594
must you give the girl unnecessarily
anxiety at this moment?


791
01:12:32.794 --> 01:12:35.034
She's almost done.

792
01:12:35.874 --> 01:12:39.594
So, what's in the lighter?
A stolen computer chip, a microfilm, what?


793
01:12:41.554 --> 01:12:43.754
What's so funny?
I don't think this is funny!


794
01:12:45.434 --> 01:12:48.874
- You really don't know, do you?
- No, of course I don't know!


795
01:12:49.314 --> 01:12:50.594
Diamonds.

796
01:12:52.394 --> 01:12:54.835
So, you and Jude
are cat burglars?


797
01:12:55.034 --> 01:12:56.434
No. We're jewelers.

798
01:12:56.674 --> 01:12:59.234
Specialized
in taking high rollers for a ride.


799
01:13:01.474 --> 01:13:02.515
Hello?

800
01:13:03.274 --> 01:13:04.794
Is this lover boy?

801
01:13:05.554 --> 01:13:07.394
- This is Harlan.
- Hello, Harlan.


802
01:13:07.874 --> 01:13:10.715
It's nice to talk to you again.
It's been a long time.


803
01:13:10.914 --> 01:13:12.274
Is Tuesday all right?

804
01:13:12.714 --> 01:13:15.194
Who? Tuesday?
She's fine.


805
01:13:15.554 --> 01:13:16.635
Right?

806
01:13:16.834 --> 01:13:17.914
Say hi.

807
01:13:18.115 --> 01:13:19.834
Harlan?

808
01:13:20.035 --> 01:13:24.194
- I'm OK...
- You see? We're all gentlemen here.


809
01:13:38.315 --> 01:13:40.435
Well, one of us is anyway.

810
01:13:42.355 --> 01:13:43.915
Look, I'm gonna make this very simple.

811
01:13:45.075 --> 01:13:48.235
You bring to us
what is rightfully our employer's


812
01:13:48.435 --> 01:13:51.155
and we'll return
your collateral to you.


813
01:13:51.354 --> 01:13:53.875
I'll do whatever you want,
just please...


814
01:13:54.435 --> 01:13:56.035
Please, don't hurt her

815
01:13:56.755 --> 01:13:59.355
We'll see you in an hour.

816
01:13:59.595 --> 01:14:00.635
In an hour?

817
01:14:01.955 --> 01:14:03.015
I can't.

818
01:14:04.755 --> 01:14:05.835
Can't?

819
01:14:06.115 --> 01:14:11.675
I can, but... later. Look, it's
really complicated, but I can get it.


820
01:14:17.475 --> 01:14:23.556
All right, Harlan, I'm gonna give you
till 5 o'clock, because I'm a charitable guy.


821
01:14:23.755 --> 01:14:26.755
And I know you're not gonna
do anything stupid. Do you know why?


822
01:14:26.955 --> 01:14:30.595
Because then Monday
will be followed by Wednesday.


823
01:14:32.036 --> 01:14:33.795
I'm gonna call you with a location.

824
01:14:34.435 --> 01:14:36.156
You give me your cellphone number.

825
01:14:36.355 --> 01:14:40.875
What is Jude's number?

826
01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:43.795
Now don't you go wandering off on me.

827
01:14:43.996 --> 01:14:46.515
- I won't, sir.
- I believe that.


828
01:14:46.756 --> 01:14:52.316
See, because your friend,
Jude, he wasn't as forthcoming. In fact...


829
01:14:52.836 --> 01:14:58.276
I wouldn't be offended
if he didn't call... ever.


830
01:15:01.396 --> 01:15:06.956
But I will call you, Harlan.

831
01:15:14.916 --> 01:15:19.476
See? That was good. Give him the
diamonds and no one's gonna get hurt.


832
01:15:19.796 --> 01:15:23.817
I don't have the fuckin' diamonds! So how
the hell am I supposed to give 'em to anybody?


833
01:15:23.836 --> 01:15:26.316
Oh, by the way. Have you
spoken to Jude lately?


834
01:15:26.517 --> 01:15:28.356
No?
That's 'cause he's dead.


835
01:15:28.796 --> 01:15:30.996
So I think we're a little bit passed
the point of "no one's gonna get hurt" here.


836
01:15:30.996 --> 01:15:32.528
Shut up a second!

837
01:15:33.907 --> 01:15:35.641
God!

838
01:15:36.677 --> 01:15:38.516
I need to to think.

839
01:15:39.557 --> 01:15:41.330
All right, here's the deal:

840
01:15:41.798 --> 01:15:43.854
I want 20,000 grand,

841
01:15:44.077 --> 01:15:47.017
in exchange I'll give you

842
01:15:47.116 --> 01:15:49.117
an exact cut from the ones we took.

843
01:15:49.316 --> 01:15:51.437
But they're not gonna
be real diamonds, are they?


844
01:15:51.717 --> 01:15:52.877
No.

845
01:15:53.917 --> 01:15:57.077
So, you want me to pass off 8 fakeys
to Guido and his sweaty friend


846
01:15:57.276 --> 01:15:59.636
in hopes that this time
they won't notice?


847
01:16:00.036 --> 01:16:01.357
That's my offer.

848
01:16:02.837 --> 01:16:04.556
I don't have that kind of money.

849
01:16:06.037 --> 01:16:07.757
Call me when you do.

850
01:16:11.396 --> 01:16:14.197
No, Riley, Riley!
Wait a minute.


851
01:16:14.397 --> 01:16:17.637
For God's sakes, can you please
just help me. You know the situation.


852
01:16:17.837 --> 01:16:20.597
I don't know anyone on earth
that will give me 20,000 dollars.


853
01:16:20.797 --> 01:16:23.557
Then I suggest you get creative.

854
01:16:31.237 --> 01:16:34.397
- Holy shit!
- So how much do you think it's all worth?


855
01:16:34.597 --> 01:16:37.677
Fuck, man! How the hell should I know
Why don't you ask the antique road show


856
01:16:37.677 --> 01:16:40.237
- Look, I'm serious.
- Me too.


857
01:16:40.998 --> 01:16:42.077
This don't look like your style, man.

858
01:16:42.277 --> 01:16:44.637
I don't have time to explain this.
I'm trying to save a girl's life.


859
01:16:44.838 --> 01:16:47.975
Hey, that sounds all heroic and stuff
but I ain't no fuckin' drug dealer.


860
01:16:48.075 --> 01:16:49.637
That's more up my cousin's alley.

861
01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:51.077
You got a big truck?

862
01:17:11.517 --> 01:17:14.478
- Hey, guys? Are you ready?
- Yeah, let's just go.


863
01:17:14.678 --> 01:17:17.278
- Keep a lookout while we load up the stuff.
- Good idea.


864
01:17:17.278 --> 01:17:20.038
Hey, you better have a fuckin' dolly.
I got a bad back, foo'.


865
01:17:25.398 --> 01:17:27.797
Jesus, it's fuckin' hot in here.

866
01:17:29.438 --> 01:17:31.438
Excuse me.

867
01:17:31.637 --> 01:17:35.038
- I have to go the bathroom.
- Go ahead.


868
01:17:37.078 --> 01:17:39.158
Keep it cracked.

869
01:17:50.158 --> 01:17:51.239
What the fuck?

870
01:17:55.278 --> 01:17:59.199
OK, that shit ain't right.
Can they do that?


871
01:17:59.558 --> 01:18:03.039
Sure. As long as
his G-string stays on.


872
01:18:04.119 --> 01:18:08.598
It's a sumo rule. You must keep
your manhood covered at all times.


873
01:18:10.198 --> 01:18:11.838
So what if his pecker pops out?

874
01:18:12.518 --> 01:18:16.439
That would be a bad thing
and constitute a forfeit of the match.


875
01:18:25.158 --> 01:18:29.639
How do you do, Mr. Shiitake?
And how do you do, Mr. Tempura?


876
01:18:39.678 --> 01:18:41.598
I'm done

877
01:18:46.279 --> 01:18:48.479
Well...

878
01:18:48.679 --> 01:18:52.959
maybe I'm just getting started

879
01:18:53.759 --> 01:18:55.759
Please...

880
01:18:55.959 --> 01:18:57.799
What, what, what?

881
01:18:57.999 --> 01:19:00.959
You wanna please me?

882
01:19:05.079 --> 01:19:10.959
On second thought, what the hell
would I do with your bony ass?


883
01:19:12.679 --> 01:19:16.000
Get the fuck outta here.

884
01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.560
Come on, let's go!

885
01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:45.880
Shit.
Hey, we got "bacon."


886
01:19:48.679 --> 01:19:50.400
Cops!
It's the cops, fool.


887
01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.360
I'll take care of this.

888
01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:57.759
Shit.

889
01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:00.920
Hi there, officer.

890
01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.800
What's going on here?
You moving somewhere?


891
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.040
No. I just bought some stuff
at a garage sale.


892
01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:12.120
You know, I really have to get this truck back
right now, 'cause I'm gonna get hit with overtime.


893
01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.920
- It's the police!
- Let's go!


894
01:20:15.121 --> 01:20:17.280
Close the door!

895
01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.561
Gentlemen.

896
01:20:24.441 --> 01:20:28.001
Harlan, can you step over here.

897
01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:32.001
- Look, I know what's going on here.
- You do?


898
01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:34.280
If these guys are
who I think they are.

899
01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:35.440
I'm not sure.

900
01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:38.280
You should've thought about that before
you hooked up with them, don't you think?


901
01:20:38.281 --> 01:20:40.520
Sir, at this point
I don't know what to think.


902
01:20:40.721 --> 01:20:41.824
Oh, I can see that.

903
01:20:41.824 --> 01:20:46.059
Otherwise you wouldn't have hired a bunch of
illegal aliens to move your furniture, now would you?


904
01:20:46.921 --> 01:20:48.281
Illegal aliens?

905
01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:52.760
Damn.
I'm sorry, I had no idea.


906
01:20:56.521 --> 01:21:01.240
I'm gonna let it slide this time,
but don't do it again.


907
01:21:02.761 --> 01:21:07.161
- Now, is Caesar around?
- Caesar?


908
01:21:07.361 --> 01:21:10.401
- No, he stepped out.
- Again?


909
01:21:12.521 --> 01:21:17.041
All right. You get your truck back
Those late charges can be a killer.


910
01:21:17.241 --> 01:21:19.561
Yes, sir.
Thank you.


911
01:21:22.241 --> 01:21:23.442
3-14 here.

912
01:21:24.761 --> 01:21:25.921
What the fuck was that?

913
01:21:26.121 --> 01:21:27.841
- Everything is cool.
- Cool my ass.


914
01:21:28.041 --> 01:21:30.921
Shit, man. No more fucking surprises.
You follow me.


915
01:21:31.122 --> 01:21:33.168
That means, buckle your ass
to my bumper. You got it, ese?


916
01:21:33.168 --> 01:21:34.380
I got it.

917
01:21:34.481 --> 01:21:36.882
Let's go.

918
01:21:38.681 --> 01:21:40.921
3-14, copy that

919
01:22:46.482 --> 01:22:47.882
Who the fuck is that honking?

920
01:22:48.682 --> 01:22:50.082
Shit!

921
01:22:51.442 --> 01:22:52.843
Shit!

922
01:22:53.162 --> 01:22:55.082
- What the fuck is he doing?
- Maybe he's signaling us.


923
01:22:55.082 --> 01:22:56.362
Shut up.

924
01:22:56.563 --> 01:22:58.242
Oh shit.

925
01:23:01.002 --> 01:23:01.962
Hello?

926
01:23:02.443 --> 01:23:06.443
The old train factory down
on Anderson Street. 45 minutes.


927
01:23:06.762 --> 01:23:08.083
I'll be there.

928
01:23:08.402 --> 01:23:13.843
And, Harlan. Come alone.
We're not fucking around here.


929
01:23:22.723 --> 01:23:24.883
What the fuck am I doing?

930
01:23:25.083 --> 01:23:27.683
- The Anderson's place is right up there, man
- I know.


931
01:23:27.803 --> 01:23:29.207
Fuck!

932
01:23:31.003 --> 01:23:32.403
Shit.

933
01:23:33.003 --> 01:23:34.162
Fuck.

934
01:23:46.923 --> 01:23:48.603
What the fuck?
Are you insane?


935
01:23:48.803 --> 01:23:50.163
- The horn's stuck.
- What?


936
01:23:50.363 --> 01:23:53.123
Hey! Do you mind
stopping that?


937
01:23:53.323 --> 01:23:55.603
- I'm trying, it's stuck
- Shut it off.


938
01:23:55.803 --> 01:23:57.938
Sorry, cous'.
It's all fucked up.


939
01:23:57.938 --> 01:24:01.044
- Junior, fix that shit.
- You got it.


940
01:24:01.243 --> 01:24:02.923
Hi. Harlan Woodriff.

941
01:24:03.644 --> 01:24:07.643
- I made a little bit of a time crunch...
- Fuck you. Open the truck.


942
01:24:18.763 --> 01:24:20.963
What did I tell you, cous'?

943
01:24:21.604 --> 01:24:23.604
OK.

944
01:24:31.004 --> 01:24:32.564
- OK, here's your money, homes
- Thank you, Alex.


945
01:24:32.564 --> 01:24:34.004
I just hope you know what you're doing.

946
01:24:34.004 --> 01:24:36.964
Yeah. I'm not running from this one.

947
01:24:38.243 --> 01:24:40.724
Listen, my sister's she's dating this police ...
He's LAPD. Maybe I can...


948
01:24:40.724 --> 01:24:43.204
No, no, no cops.
I can't take that chance.


949
01:24:43.404 --> 01:24:45.164
OK. Well, you got some big cojones.

950
01:24:45.524 --> 01:24:47.204
Yeah, I'll try to hold on to them.

951
01:24:47.404 --> 01:24:49.284
You do that.
Go get your girl!


952
01:25:15.724 --> 01:25:17.364
Cutting it pretty close, aren't you?

953
01:25:17.565 --> 01:25:18.604
Get in!

954
01:25:24.565 --> 01:25:26.804
- Nice ride
- It's all there.


955
01:25:27.324 --> 01:25:30.644
- And I'm supposed to trust you?
- You know what? Yes.


956
01:25:30.845 --> 01:25:34.165
Time's run out. I gave you the cash.
Now give me the diamonds.


957
01:25:40.124 --> 01:25:42.325
Good. Now get out.

958
01:25:42.925 --> 01:25:44.604
You've changed, Harlan.

959
01:25:45.005 --> 01:25:46.404
Yeah, too bad you never will.

960
01:26:01.405 --> 01:26:02.525
My purse!

961
01:26:02.615 --> 01:26:04.449
Hey!

962
01:26:07.805 --> 01:26:10.285
Motherfucker!

963
01:26:27.806 --> 01:26:30.445
Dwayne, it's gotta be 5 o'clock.

964
01:26:31.005 --> 01:26:32.886
What time is it?

965
01:26:33.966 --> 01:26:37.406
20 seconds later
than the last time you asked, Al.


966
01:26:43.325 --> 01:26:44.845
Oh shit.

967
01:26:52.685 --> 01:26:54.445
What do we have here?

968
01:27:00.526 --> 01:27:03.406
- This can't be him.
- Then who the fuck is it?


969
01:27:06.925 --> 01:27:09.406
Sit the fuck back, bitch.

970
01:27:09.646 --> 01:27:14.966
All right, everybody just
calm the fuck down. Maybe it'll go away.


971
01:27:22.766 --> 01:27:24.806
- It's coming right at us.
- This is fucking wrong.


972
01:27:25.007 --> 01:27:28.406
Sweetheart, is there something
you wanna share with us, huh?


973
01:27:37.607 --> 01:27:41.406
- Now what?
- We wait for him to make the fist move.


974
01:27:54.447 --> 01:27:55.727
Stop right there, motherfucker!

975
01:27:57.327 --> 01:27:59.126
What do you think you're doing?
Don't come any closer


976
01:27:59.127 --> 01:28:01.086
Shit. I'm sorry.
I'm unarmed.


977
01:28:01.327 --> 01:28:03.127
What the fuck's in the truck?

978
01:28:03.966 --> 01:28:05.047
Nothing.

979
01:28:06.326 --> 01:28:08.127
Open it up.

980
01:28:08.487 --> 01:28:09.886
I wanna see Tuesday.

981
01:28:10.087 --> 01:28:12.807
Look through the window.
She's right there.


982
01:28:16.687 --> 01:28:17.930
OK. Come on.

983
01:28:17.930 --> 01:28:21.805
We're gonna walk to the back of the truck
and you're gonna open the door.


984
01:28:21.806 --> 01:28:23.847
Very slowly, no quick moves.

985
01:28:24.047 --> 01:28:26.407
That way nobody gets hurt, okay?

986
01:28:34.047 --> 01:28:37.687
It's all right, Dwayne.
OK. Close it up, come on.


987
01:28:41.807 --> 01:28:43.847
So how do you wanna to do this?

988
01:28:44.047 --> 01:28:46.127
You give me the diamonds,
I give you the girl.


989
01:28:46.687 --> 01:28:48.808
It's that simple

990
01:29:34.688 --> 01:29:38.528
- No! Harlan!
- Al, what the hell's going on?


991
01:29:39.288 --> 01:29:41.448
Just stay with the fucking girl, all right?

992
01:29:46.008 --> 01:29:49.248
Shut that bitch up!
Shut her up!


993
01:29:49.448 --> 01:29:51.048
- Tuesday!
- Did they fuck us?


994
01:29:51.248 --> 01:29:55.088
Yeah, they fucked us. Fucked us right
up the culo, good and hard.


995
01:29:55.288 --> 01:29:56.248
Tuesday!

996
01:29:56.408 --> 01:29:58.448
Fuck you!
Get the fuck off me!


997
01:29:59.768 --> 01:30:03.888
- Tuesday!
- Dwayne, kill the fucking bitch.


998
01:30:04.088 --> 01:30:05.889
What the fuck are you talking about, Al?

999
01:30:06.088 --> 01:30:09.248
If we kill them both we ain't got shit!
We got shit, Al!


1000
01:30:12.169 --> 01:30:14.089
Fucking bitch!

1001
01:30:18.688 --> 01:30:20.048
Oh my God!

1002
01:30:23.689 --> 01:30:26.248
Are you okay?

1003
01:30:26.528 --> 01:30:28.489
Go get in the truck!
Go!


1004
01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:34.448
Fuck you, motherfucker!

1005
01:30:49.609 --> 01:30:50.649
You dumb bitch!

1006
01:30:54.169 --> 01:30:55.129
Fuck off!

1007
01:31:23.169 --> 01:31:26.530
Well, honey. It sounds like you're
having a wonderful time in California.


1008
01:31:28.129 --> 01:31:31.369
We miss you
and send our love


1009
01:31:31.689 --> 01:31:33.250
Bye.

1010
01:31:34.929 --> 01:31:37.809
I take it, we're not going
on that dang cruise.


1011
01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:40.169
I'm afraid not

1012
01:31:43.130 --> 01:31:46.209
Hey, amigo.
How about a servesa?


1013
01:31:46.410 --> 01:31:48.450
I'd rather have a hot tamale

1014
01:31:57.450 --> 01:31:59.690
Mother of God.
What the hell happened to you guys


1015
01:31:59.889 --> 01:32:02.290
- Hey, Caesar.
- Welcome back.


1016
01:32:02.769 --> 01:32:06.730
Thank you. So, what's going on?
Are you guys fucking?


1017
01:32:08.490 --> 01:32:11.690
Show me your hands!
Freeze!


1018
01:32:11.890 --> 01:32:13.530
Go!
Come on.


1019
01:32:13.810 --> 01:32:15.210
Come on!

1020
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:18.210
Go, go! Rivera,
check the back room!


1021
01:32:19.050 --> 01:32:21.890
Caesar Lopez, we have a warrant
to search these premises.


1022
01:32:22.090 --> 01:32:22.839
For what?

1023
01:32:22.839 --> 01:32:25.329
Come on, Caesar,
do I look stupid to you?


1024
01:32:25.330 --> 01:32:26.730
Don't answer that.

1025
01:32:27.090 --> 01:32:30.051
I think I found something.
I got a hidden door pad.


1026
01:32:30.650 --> 01:32:32.371
I'm screwed, my friend.

1027
01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:35.770
Don't panic. No matter what you do,
just act natural.


1028
01:32:35.970 --> 01:32:37.731
That's easy for you to say.

1029
01:32:38.210 --> 01:32:41.730
There was something growing in there,
but whatever it was, it ain't in there now.


1030
01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:43.331
It's not in there?

1031
01:32:43.650 --> 01:32:45.610
- What do you mean?
- It's empty


1032
01:32:45.811 --> 01:32:46.970
- What?
- What?


1033
01:32:47.210 --> 01:32:48.690
Well, it's gotta be
here somewhere.


1034
01:32:48.691 --> 01:32:51.691
You wanna turn this place inside out
for a joint, that's your call.


1035
01:32:51.890 --> 01:32:54.250
But we're outta here.
Let's go guys. Move 'em out!


1036
01:32:54.451 --> 01:32:55.371
No, wait.

1037
01:32:55.691 --> 01:32:57.291
Come on!

1038
01:32:57.491 --> 01:32:58.770
- Guys!
- Let's go.


1039
01:32:58.971 --> 01:33:00.851
The stuff's here.
Come on, I can feel it.


1040
01:33:01.051 --> 01:33:02.330
Yeah, feel this.

1041
01:33:02.531 --> 01:33:04.131
Fuck!

1042
01:33:06.970 --> 01:33:09.170
Caesar, I don't know how
you pulled this one off.


1043
01:33:09.730 --> 01:33:11.531
I'm sorry?
What is it you're looking for?


1044
01:33:11.731 --> 01:33:13.410
I'm not buying your act!

1045
01:33:14.291 --> 01:33:16.451
I got my eye on you.

1046
01:33:21.651 --> 01:33:25.411
If you want your nipple ring,
you come pick it up at the station.


1047
01:33:29.931 --> 01:33:31.331
What in the fuck just happened?

1048
01:33:32.051 --> 01:33:34.971
Shit! I need some tequila.

1049
01:33:36.371 --> 01:33:38.731
Yeah, we're out.

1050
01:33:38.931 --> 01:33:40.811
We're out of tequila?

1051
01:33:42.371 --> 01:33:45.451
Harlan, what happened
to all my weed?


1052
01:33:45.651 --> 01:33:47.571
I hate to break
it to you, buddy, but...

1053
01:33:47.771 --> 01:33:50.852
Your weed's gone, and it
ain't coming back. I'm sorry.


1054
01:33:51.372 --> 01:33:52.971
Shit.

1055
01:33:53.172 --> 01:33:54.851
What am I going to do?

1056
01:33:55.691 --> 01:33:59.011
You know, I should be
thanking you for saving my ass.


1057
01:33:59.332 --> 01:34:01.691
You'll have to find a way
to make an honest living.


1058
01:34:02.612 --> 01:34:05.451
And how am I supposed to do that?
I'm an artist.


1059
01:34:13.251 --> 01:34:16.572
You'll just... have to get
a little creative.
