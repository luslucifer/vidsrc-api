1
00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:16.018
No person is born with lies.

2
00:00:16.476 --> 00:00:18.435
But they start lying just
after giving birth.


3
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.320
The village head was blessed
with a baby boy.


4
00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:24.185
Baby boy had just opened his eyes...

5
00:00:24.893 --> 00:00:27.060
but the guesses already started.

6
00:00:29.018 --> 00:00:31.726
The baby is exactly like his father.

7
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.560
No! His nose looks like Surjit Kaur.

8
00:00:34.643 --> 00:00:36.203
He will definitely look
like his mother.


9
00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:39.310
Tell me, did they give birth to
a kid or get him photocopied...


10
00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:40.685
that they already knew...

11
00:00:40.768 --> 00:00:42.393
who would he follow?

12
00:00:42.768 --> 00:00:46.101
After one month, the kid's memory
card started working...


13
00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:47.685
and family members started
their work.


14
00:00:47.768 --> 00:00:49.268
What is my sweety doing?

15
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:51.018
What is my sweety doing?

16
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.393
You are my sweet.

17
00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:02.643
Dudd! Oh my Dudd!

18
00:01:17.476 --> 00:01:19.643
Mom! - Yes.
When Laddu will grow...


19
00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:22.351
me and Laddu will together
go to school.


20
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.726
Rimpi, you can go to school.
But try to stop his cries first.


21
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.143
Okay.
- Go and calm your brother down.


22
00:01:30.893 --> 00:01:34.851
Hey, Laddu! Hey,
my Laddu, will you go to school?


23
00:01:36.518 --> 00:01:38.143
Laddu!

24
00:01:50.518 --> 00:01:52.101
It was not over here...

25
00:01:52.185 --> 00:01:54.935
Not just the family members,
villagers were also not far behind.


26
00:01:57.143 --> 00:01:58.226
Greetings, village head!

27
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.351
Greetings! Where are you taking
the young head?


28
00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:01.935
Young head!

29
00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:04.768
Okay, fine!

30
00:02:08.393 --> 00:02:11.393
Before his memory card
got crashed...


31
00:02:12.268 --> 00:02:14.768
his father took him to school.

32
00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:18.393
Good morning, everyone!
Good morning, ma'am!


33
00:02:18.476 --> 00:02:22.643
Sit down!
- Thank you ma'am! I am going to mark attendance now.


34
00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:24.518
Jasmit Kaur!
Present ma'am!


35
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.060
Radha!
Present, ma'am!


36
00:02:27.143 --> 00:02:28.060
Jasdeep Singh!
Present, ma'am!


37
00:02:28.143 --> 00:02:29.435
Navjot Kaur!
Present, ma'am!


38
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.851
Ramandeep!
Present, ma'am!


39
00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:33.185
Jasdeep!
Present, ma'am!


40
00:02:43.518 --> 00:02:45.018
Okay. That's enough.

41
00:02:45.518 --> 00:02:46.810
What is your name, son?

42
00:02:46.851 --> 00:02:49.018
My mother call me a Baal and...

43
00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:50.810
my father calls me Dudd.

44
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:52.435
Grandmother calls me sweet.

45
00:02:56.018 --> 00:03:01.393
Okay.
- These all names are given to you out of love.


46
00:03:01.518 --> 00:03:04.060
But your real name is Lehmber Singh.

47
00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:06.726
That day, the kid got
to know that...


48
00:03:07.226 --> 00:03:08.601
his name is Lehmber Singh.

49
00:03:08.768 --> 00:03:12.185
Then the kid was equipped with
the information of other planets.


50
00:03:12.268 --> 00:03:13.643
Son, look at that.

51
00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:16.185
Your grandmother is spinning
wheel on the moon.


52
00:03:16.518 --> 00:03:20.226
Tell me,
did we have pests at home...


53
00:03:20.601 --> 00:03:23.726
..that granny had to go
to the moon to spin the wheels.


54
00:03:24.185 --> 00:03:26.185
We would have got pest control.

55
00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:29.310
Okay, son! There is only
a bit of milk remaining. Drink it.


56
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:32.101
Drink it, or else
the lion will come.


57
00:03:33.476 --> 00:03:36.018
Drink it! Drink it!

58
00:03:36.185 --> 00:03:38.768
My lion!
- Have you even seen the lion coming?


59
00:03:39.268 --> 00:03:41.935
Elders say that
a lie doesn't have any feet.


60
00:03:42.435 --> 00:03:44.351
You can lie as much as you want.

61
00:03:44.435 --> 00:03:46.810
One day, the kid will definitely
find out...


62
00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:48.476
that all of this was a lie.

63
00:03:48.685 --> 00:03:52.018
But till then,
the lie dances on his head.


64
00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:55.018
"O beautiful girl!"

65
00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:56.851
"Who will take care of you?"

66
00:03:56.935 --> 00:03:58.560
"Dulla Bhatti will!"

67
00:03:58.643 --> 00:04:00.518
"Dulla's daughter got married."

68
00:04:00.601 --> 00:04:02.560
"He gave her one kilo of sugar!"

69
00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:04.060
"O beautiful girl!"

70
00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:05.810
"Who will take care of you?"

71
00:04:05.893 --> 00:04:09.351
"Dulla Bhatti will!
Dulla's daughter got married."


72
00:04:09.435 --> 00:04:11.310
"He gave her one kilo of sugar!"

73
00:04:11.393 --> 00:04:13.268
"The girl is wearing
a red wedding suit!"


74
00:04:13.351 --> 00:04:15.185
"But her shawl is torn!"

75
00:04:15.768 --> 00:04:18.060
Son, come outside.

76
00:04:18.435 --> 00:04:20.643
Come here!

77
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.935
"Aunt, listen to us."
Look!


78
00:04:23.018 --> 00:04:24.369
They are here to ask for sweets
on 'Lohri' (Indian festival).


79
00:04:24.393 --> 00:04:26.935
There are grounds and sweets inside.
Go and get them.


80
00:04:27.018 --> 00:04:28.935
Mom, I won't give them.
They are mine.


81
00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:30.935
You can also have them.
Go and share them.


82
00:04:31.018 --> 00:04:33.101
Mom, then what am I supposed to eat?

83
00:04:33.185 --> 00:04:35.018
Okay. I will be right back.

84
00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:36.893
"But her shawl is torn!"

85
00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:40.601
"Who will stitch her shawl?
Uncle will."


86
00:04:40.685 --> 00:04:42.351
"The landlords plundered it."

87
00:04:42.435 --> 00:04:45.810
"The landlords are beaten up!"
Take it and give it to them.


88
00:05:08.643 --> 00:05:11.393
Go away from here.
We do not celebrate 'Lohri'.


89
00:05:11.476 --> 00:05:12.702
Why don't you celebrate 'Lohri'?

90
00:05:12.726 --> 00:05:14.143
My grandmother died.

91
00:05:14.226 --> 00:05:15.560
So we won't celebrate 'Lohri'.

92
00:05:15.643 --> 00:05:17.619
It's not like your grandmother took
the wallet with her.


93
00:05:17.643 --> 00:05:19.685
Hey, we won't take
'lohri' from them.


94
00:05:19.768 --> 00:05:22.310
We will eat sweets on his
grandmother's death celebrations.


95
00:05:22.393 --> 00:05:24.560
Okay.
Let's go!


96
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.393
"O beautiful girl!"

97
00:05:26.476 --> 00:05:29.893
"Who will take care of you?
Dulla Bhatti will!"


98
00:05:29.976 --> 00:05:32.351
"Dulla's daughter got married."
Wait!


99
00:05:32.435 --> 00:05:34.685
I will also come with you.

100
00:05:35.185 --> 00:05:36.393
What happened now?

101
00:05:36.476 --> 00:05:37.643
I will also come.

102
00:05:38.018 --> 00:05:39.935
Why? You are not celebrating
'Lohri', right?


103
00:05:39.976 --> 00:05:41.143
Your grandmother died.

104
00:05:41.226 --> 00:05:43.435
So what? At least
I can ask for 'Lohri.'


105
00:05:43.518 --> 00:05:45.976
Who is even going to give you
'Lohri'? They will give me.


106
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.060
I am the village head's son.
Okay then! Come to the front.


107
00:05:49.143 --> 00:05:52.768
"O beautiful girl!
Who will take care of you?"


108
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.726
"Dulla Bhatti will!"

109
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.810
"Dulla's daughter got married."

110
00:05:56.893 --> 00:05:58.976
"He gave her one kilo of sugar!"

111
00:05:59.518 --> 00:06:00.726
Hey!

112
00:06:00.976 --> 00:06:02.935
Who is she? Hey!

113
00:06:03.185 --> 00:06:04.768
Who is that with
a pot in her hand?

114
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:06.893
You said that your grandmother died.

115
00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:10.185
Hey, this is my grandmother's ghost.

116
00:06:10.268 --> 00:06:11.768
Run away!
Run away!


117
00:06:11.851 --> 00:06:15.393
The old grandma's ghost
is here. Run! Run!


118
00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:17.976
Hey! Hey!

119
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.226
Hey! Can't you see?

120
00:06:21.476 --> 00:06:22.810
There is a ghost.

121
00:06:22.893 --> 00:06:24.976
What ghost? Whose ghost?
Your mother's ghost.


122
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.351
My mother's?

123
00:06:26.476 --> 00:06:28.726
Who killed my mother?
Lehmber.


124
00:06:37.935 --> 00:06:41.685
"He create new troubles daily."

125
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.185
"Which ghost gets into him?"

126
00:06:46.601 --> 00:06:51.101
"He create new troubles daily."

127
00:06:51.185 --> 00:06:55.268
"They try to catch him daily, but
he doesn't get caught."


128
00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.685
"When the God was giving brains,
where were you lost?"


129
00:07:02.476 --> 00:07:08.310
"It must be a bad day for earth,
the day when you were born."


130
00:07:08.851 --> 00:07:15.101
"It must be a bad day for the earth,
the day when you were born."


131
00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:19.060
"The day you were born,
walls must have shaken."


132
00:07:19.143 --> 00:07:21.310
"The sun must have shone
from the west...


133
00:07:21.393 --> 00:07:23.476
and the war must have started."

134
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.101
"Someone must have arranged
an arena for your fight."


135
00:07:28.185 --> 00:07:32.185
"Two, three, five, you must have
turned into the right counting."


136
00:07:32.268 --> 00:07:34.601
"Turned into the right counting"

137
00:07:34.685 --> 00:07:42.685
"After watching the horoscope, even
the priest says, what the hell!"


138
00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:47.351
"What the hell! What the hell!"
"What the hell! What the hell!"


139
00:07:47.435 --> 00:07:51.601
"People are fed up and
his brain has moved to his knees"


140
00:07:51.685 --> 00:07:56.726
"After watching the horoscope, even
the priest says, what the hell!"


141
00:07:58.435 --> 00:08:02.310
"What strange thing
this is? Everyone is confused."


142
00:08:02.351 --> 00:08:07.060
"There is no rest for even
a minute. Whose food did he eat?"


143
00:08:07.143 --> 00:08:11.101
"Whose food? Whose food?
Whose food did he eat?"


144
00:08:11.185 --> 00:08:16.143
"Why doesn't he return back from
the bad omen he crossed?"


145
00:08:16.226 --> 00:08:22.143
"It must be a bad day for the earth,
the day when you were born."


146
00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:29.268
"It must be a bad day for the earth,
the day when you were born."


147
00:08:45.143 --> 00:08:48.893
"The day when you were born."

148
00:08:50.435 --> 00:08:53.101
Man! Till when will we wait?

149
00:08:53.185 --> 00:08:54.601
We will definitely talk today.

150
00:08:54.685 --> 00:08:57.351
It's his daily routine.
Yes. Moron!


151
00:08:57.643 --> 00:09:00.060
We hold meeting every third day
in the village.


152
00:09:00.143 --> 00:09:02.435
We see police every fourth day
in the village.


153
00:09:02.893 --> 00:09:06.101
Look! All of us villagers will boycott them today.
- Yes.


154
00:09:06.185 --> 00:09:08.351
Golu, pick that stone
and write on the wall that...


155
00:09:08.393 --> 00:09:11.143
the villagers are boycotting this house from today.
- Okay.


156
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.768
Oh man!
- He will learn his lesson now.


157
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:22.018
Let's see!

158
00:09:25.476 --> 00:09:28.226
Have some shame! It's
the house of the village head.


159
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.476
Why should we be ashamed?

160
00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.360
When the village head's son is
a spoiled brat.


161
00:09:31.393 --> 00:09:33.911
People will think that all of the
guys from the village are spoiled.


162
00:09:33.935 --> 00:09:36.268
No one will marry
their daughter in this village.


163
00:09:36.351 --> 00:09:37.935
Where are you hiding, uncle?

164
00:09:38.018 --> 00:09:39.786
Step out! Or else you will
never be able to step out.


165
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.018
Look what they have done.

166
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.393
Oh man! What is this?

167
00:09:52.435 --> 00:09:54.810
Look! Please don't do this.

168
00:09:54.976 --> 00:09:56.060
Listen to me.

169
00:09:56.143 --> 00:09:58.935
What's there to listen?
You can't live here anymore.


170
00:09:59.018 --> 00:10:01.060
The whole village has boycotted you.

171
00:10:01.143 --> 00:10:03.143
Now you should go to Up or Bihar
and look for land.


172
00:10:03.185 --> 00:10:04.643
Please forgive us once.

173
00:10:05.476 --> 00:10:08.185
I will beat him to a pulp,
I promise.


174
00:10:08.476 --> 00:10:11.143
I will make him docile like a cow.
Forgive him for once.


175
00:10:12.476 --> 00:10:14.435
Once! Just once!

176
00:10:14.601 --> 00:10:17.643
Please forgive me! Forgive me!

177
00:10:17.726 --> 00:10:19.310
Forgive me!

178
00:10:19.393 --> 00:10:22.685
Forgive me!

179
00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:24.643
Forgive me!

180
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.685
Thank God!

181
00:10:31.935 --> 00:10:33.560
It was just a dream.

182
00:10:35.518 --> 00:10:39.018
Before he makes us
leave the village...


183
00:10:40.101 --> 00:10:41.768
I will make him leave the village.

184
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.726
I will send him somewhere.

185
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.685
Look. Lehmber Singh
has boarded the plane.


186
00:10:56.976 --> 00:10:59.476
The land of England was
touched by the plane's tyres


187
00:10:59.935 --> 00:11:01.143
and Lehmber Singh's feet.

188
00:11:18.643 --> 00:11:20.685
Where are my sister
and brother in law?


189
00:11:22.476 --> 00:11:23.768
So strange!

190
00:11:25.726 --> 00:11:28.643
Oh! There is no network.

191
00:11:30.935 --> 00:11:33.643
How strange these people are.

192
00:11:35.643 --> 00:11:37.018
Let's go with him.

193
00:11:37.101 --> 00:11:38.351
Let's go!

194
00:11:43.435 --> 00:11:44.435
Hey!

195
00:11:45.476 --> 00:11:46.476
What?

196
00:11:47.226 --> 00:11:50.643
Oh! Give me my bouquet. Who are you?

197
00:11:51.643 --> 00:11:53.185
You are also a Punjabi.

198
00:11:53.268 --> 00:11:54.851
Yes. I am a Pakistani.

199
00:11:54.935 --> 00:11:57.143
Who are you?
I am Smith.


200
00:11:57.226 --> 00:11:59.066
No! You don't look like
a Smith from your face.


201
00:11:59.143 --> 00:12:01.768
Do I need to get flowers on my face
for that? Where is the car?


202
00:12:02.226 --> 00:12:04.786
This is the car.
- Bring the car and put this luggage in the car.


203
00:12:17.268 --> 00:12:19.435
Every country is different.

204
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.601
People don't run to foreign without any reason.
- How, brother?


205
00:12:23.643 --> 00:12:26.268
Look at us. One is from Pakistan...

206
00:12:26.476 --> 00:12:29.310
and one is from Hindustan.
Everyone is irked with everyone.


207
00:12:29.476 --> 00:12:32.185
Look here. There is no dust
on the roads.


208
00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:34.185
There are no electric wires and...

209
00:12:34.268 --> 00:12:36.476
there are only beautiful
girls around us.


210
00:12:37.643 --> 00:12:40.601
When we can here first,
we had to work hard.


211
00:12:40.976 --> 00:12:43.643
But now, the God has brought us
to a higher place.


212
00:12:44.351 --> 00:12:48.351
I make round to the village sometimes.
- Great, brother!


213
00:12:49.351 --> 00:12:50.393
Everyone says that...

214
00:12:50.935 --> 00:12:52.601
Sikh and Muslims are brother.

215
00:12:52.643 --> 00:12:54.310
Who goes up and who goes down?

216
00:12:54.393 --> 00:12:56.185
Hey! Hey! Hey,
'Galib' (A famous poet).


217
00:12:56.393 --> 00:12:57.726
Drive the car like a good person.

218
00:12:58.143 --> 00:13:00.518
Drop me on this address.
Look at this.


219
00:13:01.893 --> 00:13:03.310
This is not my route.

220
00:13:03.393 --> 00:13:04.827
I was supposed to drop you at hotel.

221
00:13:04.851 --> 00:13:07.685
It's not like you are driving
a bus to have a fixed route.


222
00:13:07.768 --> 00:13:09.393
Drive it from street to street.

223
00:13:09.476 --> 00:13:11.393
I have to go to someone's
house first.


224
00:13:11.643 --> 00:13:13.185
Then I will go to hotel myself.

225
00:13:24.393 --> 00:13:25.435
Here.

226
00:13:34.018 --> 00:13:36.643
Sir, take your bag.

227
00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.518
Are you alright?

228
00:13:38.601 --> 00:13:40.161
Will you make
your boss pick up the bag?


229
00:13:40.268 --> 00:13:42.060
Bring my bag and come behind me.

230
00:13:42.851 --> 00:13:44.768
Hey, you didn't come to pick me up.

231
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.476
I am Mr Smith.

232
00:13:46.685 --> 00:13:48.077
I am so sorry!
Come fast! Yes, sir.


233
00:13:48.101 --> 00:13:49.643
I will file a complaint.
No, sir.


234
00:13:49.685 --> 00:13:50.851
No! What is sorry?

235
00:13:50.935 --> 00:13:54.226
Come! Come fast.
I am coming.


236
00:14:08.768 --> 00:14:09.768
Hello!

237
00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:13.351
What happened, brother?

238
00:14:13.435 --> 00:14:14.685
Why are you getting angry?

239
00:14:14.768 --> 00:14:16.185
People like you come to England...

240
00:14:16.268 --> 00:14:18.268
after taking loan on
your parents lands.


241
00:14:18.351 --> 00:14:20.643
You look like a pigeon by face!
British! As if!


242
00:14:20.685 --> 00:14:22.851
So what? It's my fist time
coming to England.


243
00:14:22.935 --> 00:14:24.560
And don't take me lightly.

244
00:14:24.643 --> 00:14:26.268
I have seen England on Google.

245
00:14:26.351 --> 00:14:27.810
Take your rupees twenty.

246
00:14:27.893 --> 00:14:28.893
Run along!

247
00:14:29.476 --> 00:14:31.226
You are talking nonsense.

248
00:14:51.393 --> 00:14:53.935
What kind of horror house this is?

249
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.351
The gate is opening automatically.

250
00:14:57.476 --> 00:14:59.310
It must be cheap.

251
00:14:59.393 --> 00:15:01.643
My brother in law is
a real master mind.


252
00:15:14.435 --> 00:15:15.810
Madam!

253
00:15:16.518 --> 00:15:18.185
Is this Balvinder Kaur's house?

254
00:15:18.726 --> 00:15:19.768
I can't see her anywhere.

255
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.560
Move! I am Balvinder Kaur.

256
00:15:23.851 --> 00:15:25.976
It's not like I am paying rent here.

257
00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:29.851
Really, aunt? I thought you would
still look like a tractor.


258
00:15:29.935 --> 00:15:32.476
But you are more smart than
a Mustang now.


259
00:15:32.643 --> 00:15:35.268
I also thought that you would
look like Peter Scotch.


260
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.685
But even a trailer is
better than you.


261
00:15:38.268 --> 00:15:40.935
Aunt, you are still fun. Greetings!

262
00:15:41.018 --> 00:15:42.726
That's alright.

263
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.369
Where is your sister
and brother in law...


264
00:15:44.393 --> 00:15:45.768
They went to airport to pick you.

265
00:15:45.851 --> 00:15:47.768
I observed on thing, aunt.

266
00:15:47.851 --> 00:15:50.643
Like how Punjabi hurry
to climb a plane...


267
00:15:50.726 --> 00:15:53.351
you foreigners hurry to
pick from the airport.


268
00:15:53.435 --> 00:15:55.476
Anyone who comes here for
the first time...


269
00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.185
get lost on the way. Come.

270
00:16:07.351 --> 00:16:08.643
How was your journey?

271
00:16:09.018 --> 00:16:11.935
Did you face any trouble?
Aunt, it's not like I am a kid.


272
00:16:12.101 --> 00:16:14.768
When I reached at
the corner of your colony's road...


273
00:16:14.976 --> 00:16:17.560
I asked which is
the house of Balvinder Kaur.


274
00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:20.601
Aunt, people started following me.

275
00:16:20.643 --> 00:16:22.143
Someone told me to go right...

276
00:16:22.226 --> 00:16:24.976
and someone asked me to go left.
It was too much...


277
00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:28.143
when a white old man told me
that he would drop me.


278
00:16:28.226 --> 00:16:30.476
I told him to hold his horses...

279
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.643
because you are my aunt.
He can't flirt.


280
00:16:33.685 --> 00:16:35.643
You don't need to get frank with me.

281
00:16:35.685 --> 00:16:37.226
Don't you dare call me aunt.

282
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.685
We call our sister's
grandmother as aunt.


283
00:16:39.768 --> 00:16:42.268
Everyone around here call me
Beli aunt.


284
00:16:42.351 --> 00:16:46.268
Beli aunt, at least get me a tea.
I am so tired.


285
00:16:46.351 --> 00:16:48.851
It's been so long since
I made a tea.


286
00:16:49.018 --> 00:16:51.060
I drink black tea without milk.

287
00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:53.351
The kitchen is there.
You can go and make tea.


288
00:16:54.393 --> 00:16:55.560
How strange!

289
00:16:57.351 --> 00:16:59.768
What a great welcome!
I have to make tea myself.


290
00:16:59.851 --> 00:17:00.851
Listen!

291
00:17:01.685 --> 00:17:02.560
Who was that guy?

292
00:17:02.643 --> 00:17:06.518
Wow! Beli aunt,
I won't tell you that.


293
00:17:06.851 --> 00:17:08.268
You didn't make me tea.

294
00:17:19.851 --> 00:17:22.435
Mom, 'gulabjamun'(Indian
sweet) is very hard.


295
00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.643
Son, this is not 'gulabjamun.'

296
00:17:24.685 --> 00:17:26.244
These are sweets made
of dried milk solids.


297
00:17:26.268 --> 00:17:28.393
Your grandmother has sent them...

298
00:17:28.643 --> 00:17:31.518
for you.
Sweet is fine.


299
00:17:32.101 --> 00:17:33.935
But did she send this jacket for me?

300
00:17:34.018 --> 00:17:36.060
Am I that old to wear this jacket?

301
00:17:36.143 --> 00:17:39.476
Mom, she has made
this with her own hands.


302
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.726
Then you can wear
this jacket made NY your mom.


303
00:17:42.976 --> 00:17:45.435
I have many jackets that
I bought in London.


304
00:17:45.685 --> 00:17:47.643
Okay. I will wear it.

305
00:17:47.726 --> 00:17:50.393
Do one thing. Come
and eat your avocado sandwich.


306
00:17:50.476 --> 00:17:52.226
Your skin will glow more with this.

307
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.726
Gary, have dinner.

308
00:17:54.351 --> 00:17:55.351
Okay.

309
00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.327
Did you offer him
something to eat...


310
00:18:02.351 --> 00:18:03.791
or just asked him to sleep directly?

311
00:18:03.851 --> 00:18:06.101
It's not like he asked for a pizza.

312
00:18:06.643 --> 00:18:08.351
He asked tea made of sugarcane.

313
00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.935
What?
Jaggery tea.


314
00:18:12.018 --> 00:18:13.935
What is this?

315
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.619
Father doesn't know
about sugar cane...


316
00:18:15.643 --> 00:18:17.268
and the son doesn't
know about jaggery.


317
00:18:17.351 --> 00:18:19.018
We don't have any jaggery here.

318
00:18:19.143 --> 00:18:23.476
Mom, they have send a box of jaggery
along with the sweets.


319
00:18:23.643 --> 00:18:25.185
You could have made tea for him.

320
00:18:25.268 --> 00:18:27.685
Daughter, I know that
he is our family.


321
00:18:27.935 --> 00:18:31.643
But a person should realize soon
that this is a foreign land.


322
00:18:31.935 --> 00:18:35.226
You have to do everything on your own here.
- You are right, mom.


323
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:38.976
I think he was doing nothing there.
He will do the same here.


324
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.560
He has been sleeping
since he arrived.


325
00:18:40.643 --> 00:18:41.935
Aunt!

326
00:18:42.143 --> 00:18:43.768
I haven't been free in Punjab.

327
00:18:43.851 --> 00:18:46.018
It's not like you were
an officer there.


328
00:18:46.101 --> 00:18:48.476
Aunt, I used to work

329
00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.119
And, there was no need for me to
leave my business and come here.


330
00:18:51.143 --> 00:18:53.143
I came here for you.
Right, brother in law?


331
00:18:53.226 --> 00:18:56.393
Yes. When you will go to work
after some 20 days.


332
00:18:56.476 --> 00:18:59.476
Then you will know the reality.

333
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.060
20 days! It's hard for me
to even spend 20 minutes.


334
00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:06.018
My body starts itching if
I don't work.


335
00:19:06.101 --> 00:19:07.685
Quickly find a job for me.

336
00:19:07.851 --> 00:19:10.393
Lehmber,
your dramas won't work here.


337
00:19:10.476 --> 00:19:13.935
Here, you have to sweat even
to save four pounds.


338
00:19:14.018 --> 00:19:16.435
Roam around London for four days.

339
00:19:16.643 --> 00:19:18.768
You won't be able to even pay...

340
00:19:18.851 --> 00:19:21.036
the installments of house
and a car here for your whole life.


341
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.935
Okay. I have no problem.

342
00:19:23.018 --> 00:19:24.185
Show me around London then.

343
00:19:24.268 --> 00:19:26.060
We are busy for now.

344
00:19:26.143 --> 00:19:27.411
We will take you around on weekend.

345
00:19:27.435 --> 00:19:29.768
What? Weekend is not near.

346
00:19:29.851 --> 00:19:31.643
Okay. You can go ahead
with your jobs.


347
00:19:31.685 --> 00:19:33.810
Aunt is free.
She will show me around London.


348
00:19:33.893 --> 00:19:36.685
I haven't got a carriage
for you to show you around London.


349
00:19:36.768 --> 00:19:38.810
I have a kitty party tomorrow.
I have to go there.


350
00:19:38.893 --> 00:19:40.601
Wow! Kitty!

351
00:19:40.643 --> 00:19:43.226
Then we will dance in
the party tomorrow, aunt.


352
00:19:47.018 --> 00:19:54.726
"Twinkle twinkle little star"
"Looks like we are in clouds"


353
00:19:55.018 --> 00:20:02.810
"Everyone is looking at me
and asking about me."


354
00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:04.518
"I got so tired."

355
00:20:04.601 --> 00:20:08.810
"We are dancing in London. The
heart is going to fly."


356
00:20:08.851 --> 00:20:12.476
"But Punjab is moving."

357
00:20:12.726 --> 00:20:16.726
"We are dancing in London. The
heart is going to fly.""


358
00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:20.018
"But Punjab is moving."

359
00:20:33.018 --> 00:20:40.601
"Happiness all around. My fate
is changed, I am laughing."


360
00:20:40.685 --> 00:20:45.018
"The whole city is watching me.
I have done so great."


361
00:20:45.101 --> 00:20:48.976
"I am roaming around. My feet
are not staying still."


362
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.143
"Long long cars, having fun."

363
00:20:52.226 --> 00:20:54.685
"We have become so red."

364
00:20:54.768 --> 00:20:58.685
"We are dancing in London. The
heart is going to fly."


365
00:20:58.768 --> 00:21:01.810
"But Punjab is moving."

366
00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:06.893
"We are dancing in London. The
heart is going to fly."


367
00:21:06.976 --> 00:21:10.060
"But Punjab is moving."

368
00:21:10.851 --> 00:21:14.976
"We are dancing in London. The
heart is going to fly."


369
00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.185
"But Punjab is moving."

370
00:21:18.851 --> 00:21:22.768
"We are dancing in London. The
heart is going to fly."


371
00:21:22.851 --> 00:21:25.893
"But Punjab is moving."

372
00:21:26.601 --> 00:21:33.851
"On the parapet, there is
a white rooster waiting for you."


373
00:21:33.935 --> 00:21:40.226
"Buy me a necklace
or else you are so useless"


374
00:21:46.393 --> 00:21:49.601
Oh man! My name is not there even
in this list.


375
00:21:57.143 --> 00:22:00.643
Hello! My name is Dav. My name is
not there even in this list.


376
00:22:00.935 --> 00:22:03.935
My name is in the waiting list
since last eight months.


377
00:22:04.018 --> 00:22:05.851
At least your name is in the list.

378
00:22:05.935 --> 00:22:07.452
Some of their name is
not even in the list.


379
00:22:07.476 --> 00:22:10.143
But I really need a house.

380
00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:13.643
I have nothing to even eat.

381
00:22:14.101 --> 00:22:15.893
Sorry, sir. I can't do anything.

382
00:22:15.976 --> 00:22:18.143
Ma'am, please do something.

383
00:22:18.226 --> 00:22:21.310
You should wait. When
your name comes in the list...


384
00:22:21.393 --> 00:22:22.976
we ourselves will tell you.

385
00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.185
Please go outside.

386
00:22:26.518 --> 00:22:27.518
Go!

387
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:36.560
Mr Dave!

388
00:22:37.393 --> 00:22:39.643
Yes, ma'am!
- I am so sorry. Please don't be sad.


389
00:22:39.726 --> 00:22:41.310
I will personally try my best.

390
00:22:41.393 --> 00:22:43.976
You will definitely get a house.
Thank you, ma'am!


391
00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.393
Did you eat something?
No.


392
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.685
Okay. Just give me
two minutes. Okay.


393
00:22:58.018 --> 00:22:59.435
Thank you, ma'am!
Ginni!


394
00:23:02.976 --> 00:23:04.351
What did you do?

395
00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:08.101
You are promising everyone.
How will you help everyone?


396
00:23:08.185 --> 00:23:10.185
Money doesn't come free of cost.

397
00:23:10.351 --> 00:23:13.268
Jass, as much as you can help...

398
00:23:13.726 --> 00:23:15.018
you should do it.

399
00:23:15.268 --> 00:23:18.060
And you should not have behaved
like that with him.


400
00:23:18.226 --> 00:23:21.185
Can't you see how sad he is?

401
00:23:21.768 --> 00:23:24.560
We need to help them. It's our job.

402
00:23:24.643 --> 00:23:27.435
Yes. Ginni, I know what my job is.

403
00:23:27.518 --> 00:23:29.810
But you should also know that it's
the government's job...


404
00:23:29.851 --> 00:23:32.726
to select the names of
people in a list.


405
00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:34.518
Leave it. Let's go shopping.

406
00:23:34.601 --> 00:23:37.851
That... shopping...
Let's go tomorrow.


407
00:23:38.018 --> 00:23:42.518
Actually, I have many things to
do today. let's go tomorrow.


408
00:23:42.601 --> 00:23:46.060
Leave it. I know that you have spent
all of your money on them.


409
00:23:46.351 --> 00:23:47.726
You can't even go shopping.

410
00:23:56.685 --> 00:23:58.435
Come!

411
00:24:03.018 --> 00:24:04.851
Jordan, greetings!

412
00:24:04.893 --> 00:24:06.893
Please come, doctor. How are you?

413
00:24:06.976 --> 00:24:08.893
It's all good by the God's grace.

414
00:24:08.976 --> 00:24:10.869
You should tell me how is your health?
- Have a seat.


415
00:24:10.893 --> 00:24:12.310
You have kept me safe.

416
00:24:12.393 --> 00:24:16.101
No! Only the God can do that.
I can only give medicines.


417
00:24:16.185 --> 00:24:19.185
Anyway, he is Lehmber,
my brother in law.


418
00:24:19.435 --> 00:24:21.851
I talked to you about him, right?
- Yes.


419
00:24:22.351 --> 00:24:24.851
Good afternoon!
Very good afternoon.


420
00:24:25.768 --> 00:24:29.518
Okay, doctor. Your brother
in law is like my brother in law.


421
00:24:30.935 --> 00:24:32.851
I mean that...

422
00:24:32.893 --> 00:24:35.351
since doctor Raftar has said,
your job is done.


423
00:24:35.435 --> 00:24:36.827
You can start working from tomorrow.

424
00:24:36.851 --> 00:24:39.810
How can it be like this?
No, sir! No.


425
00:24:40.268 --> 00:24:42.518
How can you hire me
without any interview?


426
00:24:42.726 --> 00:24:44.935
You should check someone's
capabilities...


427
00:24:45.018 --> 00:24:46.476
his knowledge...

428
00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.976
his merits.

429
00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.685
How can you do it like this?
You have to pay me a salary...


430
00:24:50.768 --> 00:24:52.310
So you should know me first.

431
00:24:52.393 --> 00:24:54.143
Yes. very good!

432
00:24:54.226 --> 00:24:56.310
I appreciate your spirit.
Thank you.


433
00:24:56.726 --> 00:24:57.827
Tell me something about you.

434
00:24:57.851 --> 00:25:02.726
What do you know?
I am a economy and Hindi graduate.


435
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:04.202
To know when to lie
or tell the truth...


436
00:25:04.226 --> 00:25:06.601
is my specialty.

437
00:25:06.685 --> 00:25:08.601
Car, scooter,
tractor, or generator...


438
00:25:08.685 --> 00:25:12.143
I can operate anything.
I can repair tape, lock or motor.


439
00:25:12.226 --> 00:25:13.643
I can even climb transformer.

440
00:25:13.726 --> 00:25:16.601
Every small and big officer...

441
00:25:16.685 --> 00:25:17.952
knows me. If you want
to grab a land...


442
00:25:17.976 --> 00:25:19.736
free a land or trap someone in
a fake case...


443
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.435
I can do it within minutes.

444
00:25:21.518 --> 00:25:23.893
I have full experience of jail
and police station.


445
00:25:23.976 --> 00:25:26.560
Everything else is just words.
We should work hard and...


446
00:25:26.643 --> 00:25:29.393
I will get a chair near you.

447
00:25:29.935 --> 00:25:32.476
Wait! Wait! Wait!

448
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:34.060
Cool down!

449
00:25:34.268 --> 00:25:35.518
Doctor!

450
00:25:35.935 --> 00:25:38.060
Your brother
in law is over qualified.


451
00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.226
How can I hire such a...

452
00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:42.017
knowledgeable person.

453
00:25:42.018 --> 00:25:43.101
Knowledgeable person.

454
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:44.976
Please find a better job for him.

455
00:25:45.476 --> 00:25:47.101
Thanks a lot, Mr Jordan.

456
00:25:47.185 --> 00:25:48.476
Thanks a lot.

457
00:25:48.851 --> 00:25:51.643
Thank you very much.

458
00:25:52.726 --> 00:25:53.976
Come!

459
00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:55.970
You have touched the heights.

460
00:25:56.893 --> 00:25:58.435
Come!

461
00:26:06.101 --> 00:26:07.393
Hey, careful.

462
00:26:07.851 --> 00:26:10.643
How are you? - All good.
- Since how long are you working here?


463
00:26:10.726 --> 00:26:12.935
Seven years.

464
00:26:13.476 --> 00:26:15.768
Based on your Boss's
small thinking...


465
00:26:16.476 --> 00:26:18.935
You will at least do the same
work for next 8-10 years.


466
00:26:19.018 --> 00:26:21.393
If you want to grow,
start your own work.


467
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.060
If I was at your place...

468
00:26:23.226 --> 00:26:25.393
I would have been
the boss of this place by now.


469
00:26:30.393 --> 00:26:32.560
Why did you need to talk so much?

470
00:26:32.643 --> 00:26:35.268
This habit of yours won't allow...

471
00:26:35.685 --> 00:26:37.143
you to get any job.

472
00:26:37.226 --> 00:26:38.560
What can he even do?

473
00:26:38.726 --> 00:26:40.810
I knew it since the first day.

474
00:26:40.851 --> 00:26:42.685
He only knows how to talk.

475
00:26:42.768 --> 00:26:45.226
He has earned so much
respect for me today.


476
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:46.685
What are you saying?

477
00:26:46.851 --> 00:26:49.185
If a person has a talent,
he should share it...


478
00:26:49.268 --> 00:26:51.494
and then only the other person
will know his capabilities.


479
00:26:51.518 --> 00:26:53.310
Tell me what do you even know?

480
00:26:53.393 --> 00:26:55.101
What do I know?

481
00:26:55.185 --> 00:26:56.560
Let me tell you an incident.

482
00:26:56.643 --> 00:26:59.810
Dad gave me 1 lakh rupees and
asked me to buy a buffalo.


483
00:26:59.935 --> 00:27:02.810
Uncle, what is that?
A buffalo.


484
00:27:03.726 --> 00:27:05.476
I went to the market in morning.

485
00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:10.226
I saw many buffalo priced at 90,000
or 80,000 or 70,000.


486
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:12.310
I said them that
I could not pay that much.


487
00:27:12.393 --> 00:27:15.935
Then I saw
an ox with such a big head.


488
00:27:16.018 --> 00:27:18.935
I paid 20, 000 rupees
and got that ox.


489
00:27:19.018 --> 00:27:20.476
I brought him to home in evening.

490
00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.560
My dad and ox, both became happy.

491
00:27:22.643 --> 00:27:24.685
I knew that you would do
something like this.


492
00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:27.768
If you would have bought a buffalo,
you could milk it everyday.


493
00:27:27.851 --> 00:27:29.577
It's not like that
the ox was going to give milk.


494
00:27:29.601 --> 00:27:30.726
I didn't think about that...

495
00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.101
You need a brain to think,
not a tongue.


496
00:27:33.393 --> 00:27:35.768
Lehmber, make a promise to me...

497
00:27:36.601 --> 00:27:39.268
that you would not talk
nonsense from now on.


498
00:27:39.518 --> 00:27:43.185
You will only answer
what is asked of you.


499
00:27:43.601 --> 00:27:45.726
Okay, sister, I promise on...

500
00:27:46.435 --> 00:27:49.143
this Belli aunt.
- Why are you making a promise on me?


501
00:27:49.476 --> 00:27:50.351
I don't want to die.

502
00:27:50.435 --> 00:27:51.619
Make a promise on your sister.

503
00:27:51.643 --> 00:27:54.768
Aunt, sometimes bad things
happen to people.


504
00:27:54.851 --> 00:27:56.893
It's less risky with you.

505
00:28:45.601 --> 00:28:46.601
Thank you.

506
00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.101
Hey! Hands up!
Hands up in the air! In the air!


507
00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.851
Hey you! You two, sit down.

508
00:28:56.476 --> 00:28:58.810
Give me the cash! 
Don't act smart.

509
00:28:59.143 --> 00:29:00.143
What's that?

510
00:29:00.935 --> 00:29:03.310
Bro, last piece, single piece.

511
00:29:03.393 --> 00:29:05.976
It's only one left.
Give me that. What's this?


512
00:29:09.435 --> 00:29:11.351
You white man! Give me that.

513
00:29:11.435 --> 00:29:14.185
You pizza eaters,
when did you start eating pickle?


514
00:29:14.268 --> 00:29:15.518
Keep it down.

515
00:29:16.351 --> 00:29:17.351
Give the money back.

516
00:29:17.601 --> 00:29:18.976
Here! Here!

517
00:29:19.351 --> 00:29:21.268
I have never let even
my dirt got stolen.


518
00:29:21.601 --> 00:29:23.226
How will I let
the Queen go? Hold it!


519
00:29:23.518 --> 00:29:25.268
How dare you...

520
00:29:25.351 --> 00:29:27.476
to touch my pickle!

521
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.720
I would have let you go
if you wouldn't have done that.


522
00:29:32.268 --> 00:29:33.268
Thank you!

523
00:29:37.226 --> 00:29:38.226
Gentleman!

524
00:29:39.185 --> 00:29:41.726
Wow, gentleman! 
You have done great.

525
00:29:42.476 --> 00:29:44.060
After so many days...

526
00:29:44.435 --> 00:29:46.810
I have seen
a brave person in this country.


527
00:29:47.018 --> 00:29:48.893
According to my guess...

528
00:29:48.935 --> 00:29:51.976
you must have a military background.

529
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.726
That's so awesome.

530
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:55.768
You recognized me so quickly.

531
00:29:56.143 --> 00:29:58.435
Four of my generations
have been in military.


532
00:29:59.935 --> 00:30:01.726
You must be
a great person or else...


533
00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:03.685
a person can't be recognized
this quickly.


534
00:30:04.976 --> 00:30:07.976
Myself major Jaswant Singh!

535
00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:11.726
Oh! Sir! After seeing you,
I remembered an incident.


536
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.685
It was dangerous.

537
00:30:14.435 --> 00:30:15.768
A war was going on.

538
00:30:15.851 --> 00:30:18.685
Planes were throwing
bombs from the sky.


539
00:30:18.768 --> 00:30:20.726
Oh! - On the other side,
in the forest...


540
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:22.518
there was a fire lit by tanks.

541
00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:24.476
Everyone was running around.

542
00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:27.101
Three lions surrounded
a young soldier.


543
00:30:27.518 --> 00:30:29.143
Soldier didn't have
any more bullets.


544
00:30:29.518 --> 00:30:31.476
But he still killed three of them.

545
00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.143
There was no bullet.

546
00:30:33.226 --> 00:30:35.143
How did he do that?

547
00:30:35.226 --> 00:30:38.018
The soldiers caught the lion's paws.

548
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.935
Wow!

549
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.601
Did you caught the lion's paw?

550
00:30:42.726 --> 00:30:44.601
No. That was someone else.

551
00:30:44.726 --> 00:30:46.310
I was a mailman in the war.

552
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.518
You wasted
your time in giving letters but...


553
00:30:49.851 --> 00:30:52.060
my grandfather fought directly
with enemies.


554
00:30:53.018 --> 00:30:54.726
There was a war with China.

555
00:30:55.018 --> 00:30:57.226
My grandfather had taken
some drinks with snacks.


556
00:30:57.768 --> 00:31:00.435
He was throwing bombs after bombs.

557
00:31:00.726 --> 00:31:02.476
But then, two bullets came and...

558
00:31:02.893 --> 00:31:04.560
hit him his shoulders.

559
00:31:04.685 --> 00:31:07.768
So our grandfather's without arm
statue was erected in my village.


560
00:31:08.518 --> 00:31:09.518
Very good.

561
00:31:09.893 --> 00:31:11.060
Motivational statue.

562
00:31:11.143 --> 00:31:14.518
By the way,
young man, what do you do?


563
00:31:16.476 --> 00:31:18.893
I am taking my grandfather's
thinking forward.


564
00:31:18.935 --> 00:31:22.185
Myself Major Shamsher Singh!
- Salute!


565
00:31:25.268 --> 00:31:29.310
Hey! - Something is wrong
with your arm.


566
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:30.893
Oh!

567
00:31:31.435 --> 00:31:34.810
It's nothing, sir. I went to do
an encounter last week.


568
00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:36.935
The bullet brushed me here.

569
00:31:37.226 --> 00:31:40.935
Oh! - That's why
the muscle was pulled a bit.


570
00:31:40.976 --> 00:31:43.768
Major, can
I get your phone number please?


571
00:31:44.476 --> 00:31:46.726
No problem. Take it.

572
00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:49.601
This is how people meet.

573
00:31:49.935 --> 00:31:52.351
What is the number?

574
00:31:53.143 --> 00:31:54.476
4949...

575
00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.935
223.
Thank you!


576
00:31:56.976 --> 00:31:58.226
Major!
Okay, sir!


577
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.643
Hello, officer!

578
00:32:14.435 --> 00:32:15.726
Do you need a job?

579
00:32:16.851 --> 00:32:18.601
I do. But who are you?

580
00:32:18.726 --> 00:32:21.393
The store from you bought
these things, is mine.


581
00:32:23.851 --> 00:32:25.851
You look like
a tea seller from your face.


582
00:32:26.101 --> 00:32:28.143
You don't look like
an officer from your face.


583
00:32:32.851 --> 00:32:35.476
By the way, I am Jerry from Doaba.

584
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.393
Lehmber, From Majha

585
00:32:46.976 --> 00:32:49.476
Lehmber, did I loose some weight?

586
00:32:49.935 --> 00:32:52.310
You fat fellow,
your weight is around 2 quintal.


587
00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:54.393
How will it change within 2 hours?

588
00:32:54.935 --> 00:32:57.518
Do some hard work so that
your body can feel something.


589
00:32:57.601 --> 00:32:58.601
Do it.

590
00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.851
He has got some other channel.

591
00:33:14.268 --> 00:33:16.810
Hey, my name is Bobby.

592
00:33:18.435 --> 00:33:21.143
Your name is Bobby
but your act is like a baby.


593
00:33:21.476 --> 00:33:22.601
Be a man.

594
00:33:22.685 --> 00:33:24.143
Run like a man.
Man?


595
00:33:24.226 --> 00:33:25.268
Yes, a man.

596
00:33:25.351 --> 00:33:28.185
A person's youth must me
so attractive...


597
00:33:28.476 --> 00:33:31.226
that every UK girl
wants to have him.


598
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:32.351
Then, take me.

599
00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.476
Take me.
Be a man.


600
00:33:35.018 --> 00:33:37.935
I am asking you to be a man
and you are hitting on me.


601
00:33:38.935 --> 00:33:41.310
Lift the dumbell.
I will lift that one.


602
00:33:44.101 --> 00:33:45.851
Put that down.

603
00:33:46.518 --> 00:33:47.518
Hold this.

604
00:33:48.685 --> 00:33:50.518
Oh man!

605
00:33:50.976 --> 00:33:52.393
You broke my knee.

606
00:33:57.185 --> 00:33:58.851
What is this?

607
00:33:59.351 --> 00:34:00.471
What kind of helper you are?

608
00:34:00.518 --> 00:34:03.518
You need help yourself.
You can't even lift a dumbell.


609
00:34:03.851 --> 00:34:06.935
Mr manager, I have never wasted
my time with these dumbell.


610
00:34:07.476 --> 00:34:09.935
I have used traditional methods
to make my steel body.


611
00:34:10.185 --> 00:34:12.851
And I can't work under
your authority.


612
00:34:13.185 --> 00:34:14.768
I am leaving the job.
What?


613
00:34:15.143 --> 00:34:17.393
Hey, Baby
Boby, move!


614
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:19.226
Listen to me.

615
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:28.643
Play your tune.
What are you thinking?


616
00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.101
Do something useful.

617
00:34:31.185 --> 00:34:32.601
I will, Beli aunt.

618
00:34:33.351 --> 00:34:34.851
I should understand the game first.

619
00:34:35.226 --> 00:34:36.506
I will take the queen this time.

620
00:34:36.935 --> 00:34:39.268
Queen! No one will even give
their daughter to you.


621
00:34:40.268 --> 00:34:44.393
Aunt, let me get UK's PR first.
I'll make girls follow me.


622
00:34:45.143 --> 00:34:48.310
We also gave our such a beautiful
sister to brother in law.


623
00:34:48.768 --> 00:34:51.185
No one will give
you PR on a plate.

624
00:34:51.268 --> 00:34:52.935
You need work experience.

625
00:34:52.976 --> 00:34:54.768
You need to work for that.

626
00:34:54.851 --> 00:34:57.935
Brother in law, I am not here
to take people's orders.


627
00:34:58.018 --> 00:35:00.310
I will start some large business.

628
00:35:01.268 --> 00:35:02.476
Doctor...

629
00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:05.768
do something with
this big businessman.


630
00:35:06.476 --> 00:35:09.018
By listening his words
and getting worried...


631
00:35:09.101 --> 00:35:10.310
I will go in depression.

632
00:35:10.393 --> 00:35:13.935
Why don't you put him
on Kulwant's gas station?


633
00:35:14.435 --> 00:35:17.018
There will be no restrictions.

634
00:35:17.851 --> 00:35:19.310
That's what I am afraid of.

635
00:35:19.685 --> 00:35:21.310
What if he insults me
among the family?


636
00:35:21.851 --> 00:35:24.268
It's not about the job. I can
give him a job in the clinic.


637
00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:26.768
But it's about his actions.

638
00:35:29.143 --> 00:35:30.351
Brother in law...

639
00:35:30.435 --> 00:35:32.060
that's a very easy job.

640
00:35:32.143 --> 00:35:34.310
I have so much experience
of this job.


641
00:35:34.393 --> 00:35:35.713
That's what I did in the village.

642
00:35:35.768 --> 00:35:37.601
Did you have
a dispensary in the village?


643
00:35:37.726 --> 00:35:40.351
Aunt, I was
a moving doctor in the village.


644
00:35:40.435 --> 00:35:43.435
I used to treat...

645
00:35:43.518 --> 00:35:45.476
all of the villagers' disease...

646
00:35:45.768 --> 00:35:47.601
with one packet and...

647
00:35:47.935 --> 00:35:49.351
the person used to run.

648
00:35:49.435 --> 00:35:50.601
Lehmber, shut up!

649
00:35:50.726 --> 00:35:52.810
See, if he talks nonsense like
this in there...


650
00:35:52.893 --> 00:35:54.185
and sells his packet...

651
00:35:54.268 --> 00:35:57.351
he will get my clinic closed down.

652
00:35:58.143 --> 00:36:00.226
Lehmber, listen to me carefully.

653
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:03.851
If you keep on doing these things,
I will send you to India.


654
00:36:04.226 --> 00:36:06.560
You can sell your packets there.

655
00:36:08.268 --> 00:36:10.976
Sorry, sister. I was just kidding.
I won't do it anymore.


656
00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:13.893
I will be ready by 8:00 am
in the morning.


657
00:36:22.435 --> 00:36:24.768
Lehmber, work with dedication.

658
00:36:24.851 --> 00:36:26.643
It's our own office.

659
00:36:26.726 --> 00:36:29.310
No one will say you anything.
No worries, sister.


660
00:36:29.601 --> 00:36:32.351
Don't worry.
I will help brother in law.


661
00:36:35.185 --> 00:36:37.560
Hi!
Hi!


662
00:36:39.018 --> 00:36:41.351
Hi! Good morning!
Good morning!


663
00:36:41.935 --> 00:36:43.476
My brother, Lehmber.

664
00:36:43.768 --> 00:36:45.435
My boss, Stella!
Stella!


665
00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.268
The God must be really free
when he made you.


666
00:36:48.601 --> 00:36:51.226
He used all of
his energy in making you.


667
00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.060
You are really beautiful.

668
00:36:53.935 --> 00:36:56.018
Thank you! So nice of you!
Lehmber, come now.


669
00:36:56.101 --> 00:36:56.935
We are getting late.

670
00:36:57.018 --> 00:36:58.601
Yes, I am coming.

671
00:36:59.226 --> 00:37:01.893
Don't hit on her. Your brother
in law is calling you.


672
00:37:02.726 --> 00:37:05.310
Okay, Stella.
This is my first day on the job.


673
00:37:05.685 --> 00:37:07.935
I will see you later.
Okay. Good luck!


674
00:37:09.393 --> 00:37:11.393
Come on! Let's go!
yeah!


675
00:37:17.226 --> 00:37:18.851
How nice, brother in law.

676
00:37:18.935 --> 00:37:21.476
I thought that you were some
insignificant doctor.


677
00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.101
But you have such a huge hospital.

678
00:37:24.185 --> 00:37:26.226
Have you seen it now?
Yes.


679
00:37:27.185 --> 00:37:28.185
Come!

680
00:37:30.143 --> 00:37:31.393
That's your place.

681
00:37:32.601 --> 00:37:34.601
That seat.

682
00:37:38.768 --> 00:37:39.810
Okay.

683
00:37:40.226 --> 00:37:41.268
Listen to me.

684
00:37:43.101 --> 00:37:45.518
You have to come early in
the morning and worship.


685
00:37:46.393 --> 00:37:49.685
But the owner does that.
- You can think yourself as the owner.


686
00:37:49.768 --> 00:37:51.351
I am going out for
an important work.


687
00:37:51.435 --> 00:37:52.893
Take care of the place.

688
00:37:52.935 --> 00:37:55.351
If any patient comes,
ask them to sit. Okay?


689
00:37:55.435 --> 00:37:57.851
Okay, brother in law.
I am not your brother in law here.


690
00:37:57.935 --> 00:37:59.185
I am a doctor here.

691
00:37:59.268 --> 00:38:00.560
Doctor Avtaar Singh!

692
00:38:01.143 --> 00:38:02.601
Okay.

693
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.476
Wow God!

694
00:38:06.976 --> 00:38:08.601
You have made me an owner.

695
00:38:08.726 --> 00:38:11.893
God, please make
this place successful...


696
00:38:12.185 --> 00:38:15.768
so that he says
that Lehmber's feet are lucky.


697
00:38:17.226 --> 00:38:20.935
Let's go and see brother
in law's office.


698
00:38:25.143 --> 00:38:27.226
Wow!

699
00:38:28.226 --> 00:38:31.268
It looks like an air pump.

700
00:38:31.685 --> 00:38:32.768
Wow!

701
00:38:33.768 --> 00:38:35.601
This is a doctor's coat.

702
00:38:37.893 --> 00:38:39.685
Wow Lehmber!

703
00:38:40.143 --> 00:38:42.476
It looks really good on you.

704
00:38:45.268 --> 00:38:46.726
Oh yes!

705
00:38:46.976 --> 00:38:49.351
Our village doctor Sardul
used to have it.


706
00:38:51.476 --> 00:38:52.601
Wow!

707
00:38:54.268 --> 00:38:55.726
I can hear something.

708
00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:58.351
That's how they check.
Doctor!


709
00:38:59.143 --> 00:39:00.143
Doctor!

710
00:39:00.726 --> 00:39:02.601
Doctor is not here.

711
00:39:03.726 --> 00:39:06.018
Then who are you?
You are also a doctor.


712
00:39:06.685 --> 00:39:08.726
My self doctor Lehmber.

713
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:11.601
Please have the seat.
- Thank you so much. - What's the problem?


714
00:39:11.685 --> 00:39:13.685
I feel really cold in evenings.

715
00:39:13.768 --> 00:39:15.935
It's not a big matter.

716
00:39:16.018 --> 00:39:18.351
It's an easy job for me.

717
00:39:18.893 --> 00:39:20.560
This is your medication.

718
00:39:22.435 --> 00:39:23.726
This is your prescription.

719
00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.060
Take three liter hot water...

720
00:39:29.393 --> 00:39:31.913
and a liquor quarter in the night.
That's what you have to take.


721
00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.851
You can come and catch me
if you even need to take a blanket.


722
00:39:35.268 --> 00:39:37.310
I am not that kind of a person.

723
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.143
Doctor, fee?
What, fee?


724
00:39:40.226 --> 00:39:41.560
I haven't given you any medicine.

725
00:39:41.976 --> 00:39:43.161
But you gave this useful medicine.

726
00:39:43.185 --> 00:39:46.518
A doctor must be like you.
I'll call you after reaching home.


727
00:39:46.893 --> 00:39:48.226
You have to...

728
00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:51.518
say the same thing to my wife.

729
00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:53.351
About the drink?
About the drink.


730
00:39:55.435 --> 00:39:57.060
Go and get your medicine.

731
00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:04.351
Doctor, I am really fed up.
I am so sick.


732
00:40:04.768 --> 00:40:07.351
What happened, madam? Have a seat.

733
00:40:07.435 --> 00:40:09.726
Tell me!
- I feel ashamed even telling about it.


734
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:11.536
I didn't go since last three days.

735
00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.827
You must have not paid attention...

736
00:40:12.851 --> 00:40:14.476
That's why it spiraled
out of control.


737
00:40:14.685 --> 00:40:17.101
I paid a lot of attention.

738
00:40:17.185 --> 00:40:20.351
It's in my stomach.
All of us are born from stomach.


739
00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.893
No worries! Show me a picture.

740
00:40:21.976 --> 00:40:24.296
I am telling you that it didn't
come from three days and...


741
00:40:24.351 --> 00:40:25.476
you are asking for photo.

742
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.976
I mean that there must be
a family photo.


743
00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.101
A group photo.

744
00:40:29.185 --> 00:40:31.226
It's not like my whole family
go together to toilet.


745
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:33.327
I am saying that it didn't come
since last three days.


746
00:40:33.351 --> 00:40:35.226
First, tell me, who didn't come?

747
00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:37.060
Toilet, doctor.

748
00:40:37.143 --> 00:40:39.518
They why don't you say
that you have constipation.


749
00:40:40.268 --> 00:40:42.351
I thought that your girl ran away.

750
00:40:42.435 --> 00:40:44.235
It's been three years
since our girl ran away.


751
00:40:44.268 --> 00:40:45.476
She hasn't come yet.

752
00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.536
No worries! She will come back
after facing hard times.


753
00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.310
But, don't give hard
time to yourself.


754
00:40:49.393 --> 00:40:52.143
I will write a medicine for you.

755
00:40:52.518 --> 00:40:55.476
We will get rid of this constipation
and break the dam. Take it.


756
00:40:55.851 --> 00:40:59.101
I have written this medicine. You
have to blow it 8-10 times a day.


757
00:41:00.476 --> 00:41:01.810
Doctor, a conch shell?

758
00:41:01.893 --> 00:41:03.435
Aunt, this is your medicine.

759
00:41:03.518 --> 00:41:05.643
You just have to blow
it 8-10 times a day.


760
00:41:05.768 --> 00:41:08.810
It will open all of...

761
00:41:08.893 --> 00:41:10.185
your blockages.

762
00:41:10.268 --> 00:41:13.935
Wow, doctor! A person can do
anything in hard times.


763
00:41:14.268 --> 00:41:16.536
What will I do with medicine if
a shell can solve the problem.


764
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.268
Yeah! You just have to blow it now.

765
00:41:35.935 --> 00:41:38.101
Where is doctor Avtaar?

766
00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:41.601
I am also a doctor.
Do you think I am a nurse?


767
00:41:41.685 --> 00:41:44.310
By the way, myself doctor Lehmber.

768
00:41:44.393 --> 00:41:47.393
M. B. B. S., M. D., from
university of Las Vegas.


769
00:41:47.476 --> 00:41:48.726
Oh!

770
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:51.143
That's really nice.
Please!


771
00:41:51.226 --> 00:41:53.893
You have studies so much
at such a young age.


772
00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:57.268
Actually, I...

773
00:41:57.351 --> 00:41:59.976
my family gave me books instead
of toys at a very young age.


774
00:42:00.268 --> 00:42:02.518
So I studied and became a doctor.

775
00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.851
By the way, what's your problem?

776
00:42:06.226 --> 00:42:08.976
Actually, I feel really low.

777
00:42:09.351 --> 00:42:11.268
I also get anxiety some times.

778
00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.393
Oh! What's your job?

779
00:42:13.643 --> 00:42:15.893
I work in the Local Council.

780
00:42:17.351 --> 00:42:18.560
What is that?

781
00:42:18.643 --> 00:42:22.393
It's a Govt. job. People who can
not afford their house here...


782
00:42:22.685 --> 00:42:24.685
I get houses allotted for them
from the government.


783
00:42:24.935 --> 00:42:26.643
How great!

784
00:42:26.768 --> 00:42:27.851
I also need a house.

785
00:42:28.518 --> 00:42:30.768
You need a house?
From the government?


786
00:42:31.435 --> 00:42:32.851
I mean...

787
00:42:32.935 --> 00:42:36.018
I want a private house
like a bungalow.


788
00:42:36.101 --> 00:42:39.435
No! No! I think you're getting me
wrong. I am not a property dealer.


789
00:42:39.893 --> 00:42:40.893
Oh!

790
00:42:40.976 --> 00:42:44.976
Actually, since you serve poor
people the whole day...


791
00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.976
that may be the reason that you
feel low. Nothing to worry!


792
00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:50.851
I will write medicine for you.
Not a problem.


793
00:42:50.935 --> 00:42:53.768
You have to take
this medicine 10-15 times a day.


794
00:42:53.851 --> 00:42:56.351
10-15 times?
Won't it be an overdose?


795
00:43:00.101 --> 00:43:01.685
You are really funny you know.

796
00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:04.601
The course might take
a bit longer time...


797
00:43:04.685 --> 00:43:05.911
and you might have to come to
the clinic again.


798
00:43:05.935 --> 00:43:08.393
Of course, I will come again.
Just give me your number.


799
00:43:08.726 --> 00:43:09.893
Yes. Why not?

800
00:43:10.143 --> 00:43:11.351
Please note it down.

801
00:43:11.435 --> 00:43:14.101
0044

802
00:43:14.518 --> 00:43:16.143
Isn't it a country code?

803
00:43:16.435 --> 00:43:18.060
Actually it has become
my habit since...


804
00:43:18.143 --> 00:43:19.935
I have patients all
around the world.


805
00:43:20.018 --> 00:43:22.893
So I have to tell my country
code to them.


806
00:43:22.976 --> 00:43:25.851
No problem! I will feed it.

807
00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:29.018
Take it, ma'am!
Thank you!


808
00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:32.435
I definitely have to meet you again.
- Yes.


809
00:43:32.518 --> 00:43:33.810
Thank you!
Thank you!


810
00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:35.143
Bye! Bye!
Okay.


811
00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.268
Oh God!

812
00:43:40.351 --> 00:43:43.351
I am not a normal person.

813
00:43:43.435 --> 00:43:45.643
How awesome!

814
00:43:56.893 --> 00:44:02.643
"Love you my life,
since the day you hold my hand."


815
00:44:02.726 --> 00:44:08.101
"Hey, fairy, just by looking at you,
this guy keeps on dreaming."


816
00:44:08.185 --> 00:44:11.018
"I adore you so much love"

817
00:44:11.101 --> 00:44:13.810
"I can't stay without you even
for a moment."


818
00:44:13.893 --> 00:44:16.768
"I adore you so much love"

819
00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:19.560
"I can't stay without you even
for a moment."


820
00:44:19.643 --> 00:44:22.518
"My eyes like you
a lot."


821
00:44:22.601 --> 00:44:25.393
"That's why I liked you."

822
00:44:25.476 --> 00:44:32.226
"Love you my life,
since the day you hold my hand."


823
00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:42.310
What happened to you?

824
00:44:42.601 --> 00:44:44.401
You are laughing even while
watching the news.


825
00:44:45.018 --> 00:44:46.393
Oh! The news is running.

826
00:44:47.935 --> 00:44:49.435
I was not paying attention there.

827
00:44:49.518 --> 00:44:51.118
Where are you paying
your attention then?


828
00:44:51.226 --> 00:44:53.935
Did you start liking a girl?
- Oh! No!


829
00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:56.393
Sister, it's not about a girl.

830
00:44:57.435 --> 00:45:01.185
When I'll like someone,
I will first tell you.


831
00:45:05.518 --> 00:45:09.893
Oh! If it's not about that,
who eats a carrot with tea?


832
00:45:25.268 --> 00:45:27.476
Lehmber Singh, are you done cleaning?

833
00:45:28.893 --> 00:45:29.893
Yes.

834
00:45:30.726 --> 00:45:32.060
The stock is full, right?

835
00:45:33.226 --> 00:45:35.685
I brought two bottles yesterday.

836
00:45:36.143 --> 00:45:39.476
Why do you always think about
alcohol? I am talking about medicine.


837
00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.726
And keep your attention on the work.

838
00:45:42.268 --> 00:45:43.976
Yes. That's complete.

839
00:45:46.185 --> 00:45:47.351
Oh God!

840
00:45:48.101 --> 00:45:49.976
It's trouble.

841
00:45:55.726 --> 00:45:56.935
Hello! Yes.

842
00:45:57.976 --> 00:45:58.976
Who is this?

843
00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:00.810
Oh!

844
00:46:01.351 --> 00:46:03.018
How did this happen?

845
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:07.226
Don't worry!
Doctor will be there right away.


846
00:46:07.726 --> 00:46:10.643
Yes. he will be there. Cut the call
and I'll send him right away.


847
00:46:12.726 --> 00:46:14.726
Doctor, it was a lady calling.

848
00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:17.060
Her husband was bitten by a dog.
Please hurry up.


849
00:46:17.143 --> 00:46:19.286
If a dog has bitten, they should
show to a dog's doctor.


850
00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:20.935
I am human's doctor.

851
00:46:21.018 --> 00:46:23.768
I mean, the man was
bitten by the dog.


852
00:46:24.101 --> 00:46:26.351
She was really worried. Hurry up!

853
00:46:26.476 --> 00:46:29.643
You should directly ay that
we should check the person.


854
00:46:29.726 --> 00:46:31.268
Doctor, please hurry up!

855
00:46:31.726 --> 00:46:33.226
Please go, my lord!

856
00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:35.810
I am not an animal doctor
who goes to people's houses.


857
00:46:35.893 --> 00:46:38.768
Ask them to come to the clinic
and I'll check.


858
00:46:38.851 --> 00:46:41.643
Then do one thing. Give me
the address of a good doctor.


859
00:46:41.726 --> 00:46:43.560
I will ask them to get
treatment from there.


860
00:46:43.643 --> 00:46:46.601
Hey, I am the best doctor
of this area.


861
00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:48.744
Doctor, I am not saying based
on treatment...


862
00:46:48.768 --> 00:46:50.185
I am saying based on humanity.

863
00:46:50.268 --> 00:46:53.101
A doctor who doesn't
differentiate...


864
00:46:53.185 --> 00:46:54.577
and go to a patient in
any situation.


865
00:46:54.601 --> 00:46:57.393
I know very well about my
duty to check a patient.


866
00:46:57.518 --> 00:46:58.893
Tell me the address. I will go...

867
00:46:58.976 --> 00:47:02.226
Hurry up. It's the house
at the right side of the shrine.


868
00:47:02.976 --> 00:47:03.976
Okay.

869
00:47:06.518 --> 00:47:08.893
You will find people standing
outside the shrine.


870
00:47:16.018 --> 00:47:19.643
Thank god brother in law has left.
Dr Lehmber, get ready.


871
00:47:35.893 --> 00:47:38.518
Doctor, I am really sorry!
I am a bit late.


872
00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:39.851
It's good that you're late...

873
00:47:39.935 --> 00:47:41.535
Else, there would have
been some problem.


874
00:47:42.018 --> 00:47:43.768
Problem? What problem?

875
00:47:44.351 --> 00:47:46.351
It was a lot of rush.
I am kidding. Have a seat.


876
00:47:46.476 --> 00:47:48.851
Okay. - tell me,
how are you feeling these days?


877
00:47:48.935 --> 00:47:51.310
I feel really good these days.

878
00:47:51.643 --> 00:47:53.101
I am really happy too.

879
00:47:53.185 --> 00:47:55.435
That's a nice thing.
We should stay happy.


880
00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:57.851
You will have to come
for more 2-3 times.


881
00:47:58.351 --> 00:48:00.893
Then?
- Then, you will be good on your own.


882
00:48:00.976 --> 00:48:01.976
What?

883
00:48:05.018 --> 00:48:07.768
One minute!
Yes. Listen to me!


884
00:48:07.851 --> 00:48:09.143
Where did you send me?

885
00:48:09.393 --> 00:48:11.976
If I get irritated,
I will break your legs.


886
00:48:12.393 --> 00:48:14.268
There is neither
a person nor a human...


887
00:48:14.351 --> 00:48:16.101
Why? Where are you standing?

888
00:48:16.185 --> 00:48:19.935
I am in front of the shrine.
I sent you on purpose. Why?


889
00:48:21.351 --> 00:48:23.560
When did you go to
the shrine last time?


890
00:48:24.726 --> 00:48:26.726
Don't laugh and go there.

891
00:48:26.768 --> 00:48:28.286
Go to the God's place
and pay your respect.


892
00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:30.310
Eat the food and work will keep
on going like this.


893
00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.393
Okay.
Okay.


894
00:48:33.393 --> 00:48:35.077
Who was that? Who were you giving
the directions?


895
00:48:35.101 --> 00:48:37.518
No one. He is my friend. Actually...

896
00:48:37.601 --> 00:48:39.476
he needs some counseling some time.

897
00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:41.143
That's nice too.

898
00:48:41.768 --> 00:48:43.935
You made me so happy.

899
00:48:44.018 --> 00:48:46.726
You gave me so much happiness.
So I'll also write a medicine.


900
00:48:46.976 --> 00:48:48.518
Oh?
Yes.


901
00:49:04.768 --> 00:49:08.726
Doctor, are you here to give me
glucose or get me coffee?


902
00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:11.476
I have never given and injection
to anyone and


903
00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.435
never suggested someone to
have medicine.


904
00:49:13.518 --> 00:49:16.185
I treat my patients with love.

905
00:49:16.268 --> 00:49:18.726
Woo! Naturalpathy.

906
00:49:19.101 --> 00:49:20.643
I have to become your friend now.

907
00:49:20.726 --> 00:49:22.601
Tell me your Facebook id.

908
00:49:23.268 --> 00:49:28.143
Lehmber, all of your Facebook photos
show you drinking in the farms.


909
00:49:28.226 --> 00:49:30.560
Leave it! What if your pair
break even before forming?


910
00:49:30.643 --> 00:49:31.643
Doctor!

911
00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:34.476
I am asking your Facebook id.
Tell me.


912
00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:36.768
Oh! I...

913
00:49:37.101 --> 00:49:39.143
never made an account on
social media.


914
00:49:39.226 --> 00:49:42.768
Actually, I don't believe
in the face but in the heart.


915
00:49:42.851 --> 00:49:45.768
Doctor, your words are right.
But with social media...


916
00:49:45.851 --> 00:49:47.560
you can form a social circle.

917
00:49:47.643 --> 00:49:49.393
And you are new in this city,

918
00:49:49.476 --> 00:49:51.226
you definitely need promotion.

919
00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:54.310
Miss Ginni, you can do my
promotion on your id.


920
00:49:54.393 --> 00:49:56.268
Why are you confusing me with
all this?


921
00:49:56.351 --> 00:49:57.351
Actually,

922
00:49:57.893 --> 00:49:59.810
I don't believe in this kind of...

923
00:50:00.143 --> 00:50:01.268
Oh! really!

924
00:50:01.893 --> 00:50:04.393
Give me your phone.
I'll make your Facebook id.


925
00:50:08.018 --> 00:50:09.726
Give me your phone.

926
00:50:12.518 --> 00:50:14.976
Doctor, I am asking for your phone.

927
00:50:17.518 --> 00:50:18.518
Give me the phone.

928
00:50:19.685 --> 00:50:22.226
Leave it! I will definitely make
an id.


929
00:50:24.018 --> 00:50:26.976
- Leave it!
- Okay! Okay!


930
00:50:29.643 --> 00:50:30.643
Doctor!

931
00:50:31.143 --> 00:50:32.476
I am so dead.

932
00:50:33.268 --> 00:50:35.351
You really don't use Facebook.

933
00:50:35.726 --> 00:50:37.560
I mean, you don't
use any social media.


934
00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:41.101
Have your coffee.
I will make your id.


935
00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:42.560
Umm!

936
00:50:43.518 --> 00:50:45.935
Do you know that

937
00:50:46.018 --> 00:50:50.393
you can find all of school and
college friends on social media?


938
00:50:50.476 --> 00:50:52.310
She is teaching a priest how
to read Geeta.


939
00:50:52.393 --> 00:50:54.101
What else I have done other
than this?


940
00:50:54.185 --> 00:50:56.810
I have drunk alcohol or have
done fighting.


941
00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.643
I am making your id now.

942
00:50:59.143 --> 00:51:01.310
See! Your id is ready.

943
00:51:01.726 --> 00:51:03.726
Now, wear your coat and we will...

944
00:51:04.018 --> 00:51:05.768
set your profile picture.

945
00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:08.018
Wear it! Wear it! Wear it! Fast!

946
00:51:09.893 --> 00:51:10.893
Okay.

947
00:51:12.685 --> 00:51:14.560
Okay.

948
00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:16.893
Okay.

949
00:51:17.143 --> 00:51:18.351
It's done.

950
00:51:18.893 --> 00:51:20.560
Now we will upload your video.

951
00:51:20.601 --> 00:51:22.726
- Okay? ready?
- Yeah!


952
00:51:23.018 --> 00:51:25.268
Hi guys! This is Ginni from London.

953
00:51:25.351 --> 00:51:26.726
He is doctor Lehmber.

954
00:51:26.976 --> 00:51:29.518
I used to feel really low and feel
really sad before.


955
00:51:29.601 --> 00:51:31.726
But since I started getting treated
from him,


956
00:51:31.810 --> 00:51:33.726
you know what, I am feeling
very positive,


957
00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:35.893
very good. If you also have any
issue,


958
00:51:35.976 --> 00:51:38.226
you should message him right now.

959
00:51:38.601 --> 00:51:40.101
When did he become a doctor?

960
00:51:40.935 --> 00:51:42.726
This guy is really smart.

961
00:51:43.435 --> 00:51:45.768
Why would he call us?
He has got a girl.


962
00:51:46.018 --> 00:51:48.310
- Who got a girl?
- Our Lehmber.


963
00:51:48.393 --> 00:51:49.685
Show the picture.

964
00:51:49.768 --> 00:51:51.494
You are not supposed to see your
daughter in law's photo, dad.


965
00:51:51.518 --> 00:51:53.143
I will go and tell other
villagers.


966
00:51:53.226 --> 00:51:55.143
Wait! Wait! I will also come.

967
00:51:55.601 --> 00:51:57.768
Lehmber,
has become a doctor, people!


968
00:51:58.393 --> 00:51:59.893
He has become a doctor.

969
00:52:00.643 --> 00:52:03.101
Uncle, Lehmber has become a doctor.

970
00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:06.310
Uncle, our Lmaber
has started a new thing.


971
00:52:06.393 --> 00:52:07.935
He has become a doctor now.

972
00:52:08.018 --> 00:52:10.101
A person can't become a conductor...

973
00:52:10.185 --> 00:52:12.268
as quickly as Lehmber
has become a doctor.


974
00:52:15.810 --> 00:52:18.393
You should call him. He will
tell you the truth.


975
00:52:19.101 --> 00:52:21.393
No, brother. I am also scared.

976
00:52:21.851 --> 00:52:23.601
He has raised a new trouble.

977
00:52:24.018 --> 00:52:25.143
You should do it yourself.

978
00:52:25.226 --> 00:52:27.935
Surjit Kaur,
you should talk to Rimpi.


979
00:52:28.018 --> 00:52:29.560
They will keep on discussing.

980
00:52:29.893 --> 00:52:31.601
Yes. You should do it.

981
00:52:39.976 --> 00:52:41.768
Mom's call! That too so early
in the morning.


982
00:52:44.893 --> 00:52:46.685
Greetings, mom!
Greeting, daughter!


983
00:52:46.768 --> 00:52:48.888
What's the matter? You called so
early in the morning.


984
00:52:48.976 --> 00:52:51.268
I called you without any reason.

985
00:52:51.351 --> 00:52:52.601
Is everyone good?

986
00:52:53.143 --> 00:52:55.268
Everyone is good. What will
happen to us?


987
00:52:55.601 --> 00:52:57.226
Oh! Is our Lehmber alright?

988
00:52:57.601 --> 00:53:00.060
- Mom, Lehmber is also good.
- Okay.


989
00:53:00.351 --> 00:53:03.810
Why are you dragging it? Ask her
directly about that doctor stuff?


990
00:53:03.893 --> 00:53:05.018
What stuff, mom?

991
00:53:05.101 --> 00:53:08.310
Rimpi, Sukha showed us a picture.

992
00:53:08.393 --> 00:53:10.435
He was saying that our Lehmber
became a doctor.


993
00:53:12.268 --> 00:53:14.435
Mom, he didn't become a doctor.

994
00:53:14.518 --> 00:53:16.935
He has started going to the clinic
with his brother in law.


995
00:53:17.351 --> 00:53:20.018
He is really working hard.
- Oh! He puts his heart into the job.


996
00:53:20.685 --> 00:53:22.351
- Thank God!
- Thank God!


997
00:53:22.601 --> 00:53:25.268
Mom, you should not worry about him.

998
00:53:25.351 --> 00:53:28.101
Okay. I will call you later.
You must have something to do.


999
00:53:28.185 --> 00:53:29.893
Okay then!

1000
00:53:32.185 --> 00:53:35.226
- Thank God!
- Thank God!


1001
00:53:38.268 --> 00:53:39.393
Doctor,

1002
00:53:39.893 --> 00:53:42.185
did you see that? Our video got
viral.


1003
00:53:42.226 --> 00:53:43.601
Yeah! I saw that.

1004
00:53:43.893 --> 00:53:45.768
My friends back in the village also
saw it.


1005
00:53:45.851 --> 00:53:48.393
What?
- They were asking me who was the girl?


1006
00:53:48.851 --> 00:53:50.560
Then, what did you say?

1007
00:53:50.643 --> 00:53:52.601
Oh! I told them she was patient.

1008
00:53:53.851 --> 00:53:56.101
Oh! I am still a patient.

1009
00:53:56.685 --> 00:53:59.268
You will keep on meeting as long
as you stay my patient.


1010
00:53:59.643 --> 00:54:00.685
You will remember me.

1011
00:54:00.768 --> 00:54:02.476
Or else you will forget...

1012
00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:04.893
about this Lehmber.

1013
00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:08.226
You are not something who can be
forgotten.


1014
00:54:08.643 --> 00:54:11.226
And I don't make friends so quickly.

1015
00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:13.393
If I have made you my friend,

1016
00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.435
there must be something.

1017
00:54:16.685 --> 00:54:17.726
Oh!

1018
00:54:18.685 --> 00:54:19.685
Hey! Hey!

1019
00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:23.101
I know it!
- What do you know? Who are you?


1020
00:54:23.768 --> 00:54:25.935
Who am I?

1021
00:54:26.018 --> 00:54:28.935
The heart wants to say it
but it's shy.


1022
00:54:29.018 --> 00:54:30.185
What do you need?

1023
00:54:30.268 --> 00:54:31.601
Don't get a curse from me.

1024
00:54:31.851 --> 00:54:33.601
That's what I do.

1025
00:54:33.685 --> 00:54:36.268
Make a pair and make a print.

1026
00:54:39.018 --> 00:54:41.060
Give me a pound. 
Give me a pound.

1027
00:54:41.143 --> 00:54:43.893
Don't do it. take it and go.

1028
00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:45.310
Take it.

1029
00:54:47.893 --> 00:54:49.435
Yeah!

1030
00:54:50.976 --> 00:54:57.185
"You exactly look like a moon."

1031
00:54:57.518 --> 00:55:03.268
"My eyes ask you to sit
in front of me."


1032
00:55:04.101 --> 00:55:10.560
"You exactly look like a moon."

1033
00:55:11.226 --> 00:55:15.976
"I want to love
you the whole night."


1034
00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:22.226
"I want to spill all of my heart
to you."


1035
00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:30.143
"Now, what can I do?
I don't live without you."


1036
00:55:30.435 --> 00:55:35.810
"I lost my sleep after connecting
my heart."


1037
00:55:36.518 --> 00:55:42.435
"My eyes stay awake these days
after taking your feelings."


1038
00:55:42.476 --> 00:55:48.893
"My eyes stay awake these days
after taking your feelings."


1039
00:55:48.976 --> 00:55:52.976
"My eyes stay awake these days.."

1040
00:55:53.060 --> 00:56:00.226
"after taking your feelings."

1041
00:56:12.476 --> 00:56:18.893
"My breath works on your
signs."


1042
00:56:18.976 --> 00:56:24.935
"My nights and my days pass here."

1043
00:56:28.768 --> 00:56:35.435
"My breath works on your
signs."


1044
00:56:35.518 --> 00:56:41.768
"My nights and my days pass here."

1045
00:56:41.851 --> 00:56:48.060
"I have formed friendship
for lives with you."


1046
00:56:48.143 --> 00:56:54.476
"I have my stake over you, darling"

1047
00:56:54.560 --> 00:57:01.143
"You have become my life."

1048
00:57:01.226 --> 00:57:07.018
"Never turn your back on me
and leave."


1049
00:57:07.101 --> 00:57:10.560
"My eyes stay awake these days.."

1050
00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:16.226
"after taking your feelings."

1051
00:57:37.518 --> 00:57:38.685
Son!

1052
00:57:39.268 --> 00:57:40.851
You have studied enough.

1053
00:57:41.435 --> 00:57:42.835
It's time to perform practical now.

1054
00:57:44.143 --> 00:57:46.143
Daddy, I am not studying
Punjabi language.


1055
00:57:46.226 --> 00:57:49.143
I am studying human psychology.
Great.


1056
00:57:49.893 --> 00:57:52.476
Then, you must have
found out that...


1057
00:57:52.810 --> 00:57:55.810
how strong a military man's
psychology is.


1058
00:57:56.101 --> 00:57:59.851
That's why I have chosen a military
officer for you.


1059
00:58:00.185 --> 00:58:03.018
His name is Major Shamsher Singh.
But dad, I have...


1060
00:58:04.268 --> 00:58:06.643
That... oh Dad!

1061
00:58:06.726 --> 00:58:08.518
I like a guy.

1062
00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:11.310
His name is Dr. Lehmber.
Well...


1063
00:58:11.768 --> 00:58:14.018
you know that safety is...

1064
00:58:14.435 --> 00:58:16.226
really important in the life.

1065
00:58:16.310 --> 00:58:18.643
And only a military
man can keep you safe.


1066
00:58:18.726 --> 00:58:21.351
But health and security is also
important these days.


1067
00:58:21.393 --> 00:58:24.851
And only a doctor can do that.
No! No! No, daughter.


1068
00:58:24.935 --> 00:58:26.435
I am a military man.

1069
00:58:26.518 --> 00:58:30.143
I want that my daughter marries
a military man.


1070
00:58:30.226 --> 00:58:32.810
I will not marry you somewhere,

1071
00:58:32.893 --> 00:58:34.494
where the post doesn't
contain the 'man' word.


1072
00:58:34.518 --> 00:58:35.976
Okay, daddy. Do one thing.

1073
00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:38.810
We have a watchman, right?
Get me married to him.


1074
00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:42.351
He is also a watchman. His name also
has man.


1075
00:58:44.101 --> 00:58:47.268
My daughter, I am going to
arrange your meeting...


1076
00:58:47.810 --> 00:58:49.726
with a military man tomorrow.

1077
00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:52.018
His name is major Shamsher Singh.

1078
00:58:52.101 --> 00:58:54.851
No, daddy. We won't meet major
Singh tomorrow.


1079
00:58:54.935 --> 00:58:56.435
We will meet the doctor tomorrow.

1080
00:58:56.518 --> 00:58:58.476
- Dr. Lehmber.
- Okay.


1081
00:58:58.768 --> 00:59:01.018
I don't mind. Let's do one thing.

1082
00:59:01.601 --> 00:59:03.726
In the morning, you can call Dr.
Lehmber at home.


1083
00:59:04.018 --> 00:59:07.351
I will take you to meet Major
Shamsher Singh in the evening.


1084
00:59:07.435 --> 00:59:08.810
- Well?
- Done.


1085
00:59:09.351 --> 00:59:10.810
- Sure.
- Okay.


1086
00:59:11.643 --> 00:59:15.268
Thank you, dad! I will call Lmaber.
Okay.


1087
00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:20.726
Jerry, if Ginni's daddy agrees,

1088
00:59:21.101 --> 00:59:23.268
I will get sweets for you.

1089
00:59:23.726 --> 00:59:27.435
Bro, this is London. Sweets won't
work here.


1090
00:59:28.226 --> 00:59:30.101
If you want to do some charity,

1091
00:59:30.476 --> 00:59:32.768
then you can give a pound to some
monkey or bear.


1092
00:59:32.851 --> 00:59:34.393
I have done so many times.

1093
00:59:34.476 --> 00:59:36.601
A bear comes everywhere I go.

1094
00:59:36.685 --> 00:59:38.435
He has already taken 30 - 40 pounds
from me.


1095
00:59:38.851 --> 00:59:41.143
Okay then. Your relation will
be approved.


1096
00:59:41.226 --> 00:59:42.726
Take care this from next time.

1097
00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:45.476
When you see him anywhere, give him

1098
00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:47.370
Not just twenty,
I will give him thirty.


1099
00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:50.071
It's just that Ginni should not
get angry...


1100
00:59:50.435 --> 00:59:53.435
when I tell her that
I am not Dr. Lehmber


1101
00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:55.060
but just Lehmber.

1102
00:59:55.393 --> 00:59:57.685
Do you want to tell the truth
to sister in law?


1103
00:59:58.268 --> 01:00:00.518
Bro, when you start a new relation,

1104
01:00:00.935 --> 01:00:02.685
you should start it with the truth.

1105
01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:05.143
Oh! That's good!

1106
01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:07.310
But yes,

1107
01:00:07.393 --> 01:00:09.536
when you will go to meet that
major's daughter tomorrow,


1108
01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:12.268
take me with you. What if I get
a chance?


1109
01:00:12.518 --> 01:00:14.351
Even if I don't, no problem.

1110
01:00:14.726 --> 01:00:16.851
We will get rum from major.

1111
01:00:17.435 --> 01:00:18.685
You!

1112
01:01:22.643 --> 01:01:26.476
"Your weight is equal
to five flowers."


1113
01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:30.476
How is he here? Is he a major
or a messenger?


1114
01:01:30.851 --> 01:01:33.435
- He reaches everywhere.
- Wow! You?


1115
01:01:34.101 --> 01:01:36.810
I heard that officers are always
on time.


1116
01:01:37.393 --> 01:01:39.351
But I am seeing it
for the first time...


1117
01:01:39.435 --> 01:01:43.101
that they are so advance.
Come on gentleman! Come inside.


1118
01:01:43.351 --> 01:01:44.851
Come in! Come in!

1119
01:01:44.935 --> 01:01:46.643
Finally you found the house.

1120
01:01:47.268 --> 01:01:49.018
You can find it on Google.

1121
01:01:49.101 --> 01:01:51.643
Doctor, you are here.

1122
01:01:56.643 --> 01:01:59.143
Doctor, you...
Daddy, he is Dr. Lehmber.


1123
01:01:59.185 --> 01:02:01.018
No, daughter. He is...

1124
01:02:01.101 --> 01:02:02.101
major Shamsher Singh.

1125
01:02:02.143 --> 01:02:03.935
No, daddy. He is doctor Lehmber.

1126
01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:05.476
He is major Shamsher Singh.

1127
01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.268
Daddy, I told you right,
he is doctor Lehmber.


1128
01:02:08.351 --> 01:02:10.601
Daughter, you never listen
to anyone. Let's do one thing.


1129
01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:12.768
- Let's ask him.
- Okay. Ask him.


1130
01:02:12.851 --> 01:02:13.851
Huh?

1131
01:02:24.518 --> 01:02:27.226
The pulse is working fine.
Is he acting?


1132
01:02:28.143 --> 01:02:29.601
What happened to my brother?

1133
01:02:30.351 --> 01:02:32.893
What happened to him?
Nothing. He is absolutely fine.


1134
01:02:33.351 --> 01:02:35.351
Lehmber. Why won't he get up?

1135
01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:36.518
Lehmber.

1136
01:02:38.685 --> 01:02:41.851
Lehmber. Isn't
he officer Shamsher Singh?


1137
01:02:42.018 --> 01:02:43.476
Dad, didn't I say...

1138
01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.476
he is Dr Lehmber?

1139
01:02:46.726 --> 01:02:48.268
Look, he is neither a doctor...

1140
01:02:48.351 --> 01:02:49.560
nor an officer.

1141
01:02:49.643 --> 01:02:51.018
He is my brother-in-law.

1142
01:02:51.976 --> 01:02:53.435
He is my brother.

1143
01:02:53.518 --> 01:02:55.810
He came from Punjab 2 months ago.

1144
01:02:55.893 --> 01:02:58.768
He is neither a doctor...

1145
01:02:58.851 --> 01:03:00.185
nor an officer.

1146
01:03:00.726 --> 01:03:02.976
He came from India 2 months ago.

1147
01:03:03.643 --> 01:03:04.643
Hmm.

1148
01:03:05.435 --> 01:03:09.310
He lied to me.

1149
01:03:10.268 --> 01:03:12.601
If he can lie to Ginni...

1150
01:03:12.851 --> 01:03:14.101
he can lie to me also.

1151
01:03:14.435 --> 01:03:17.310
Doctor, when he regains
consciousness, tell him...


1152
01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:20.143
not to try to meet me
and my daughter.


1153
01:03:20.226 --> 01:03:23.560
Hereafter, Ginni
and I have nothing to do with him.


1154
01:03:25.143 --> 01:03:27.476
I can't even see his face.

1155
01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:43.976
"Don't ever fall in love."

1156
01:03:44.143 --> 01:03:50.393
"You have to go through
a test of fire."


1157
01:03:51.101 --> 01:03:56.685
"Love overwhelms the lovers."

1158
01:03:56.851 --> 01:04:02.060
"Love makes the heart pine."

1159
01:04:02.143 --> 01:04:07.810
"Love makes the heart pine."

1160
01:04:07.893 --> 01:04:13.893
"Love overwhelms the lovers."

1161
01:04:13.976 --> 01:04:19.393
"Love makes the heart pine."

1162
01:04:19.685 --> 01:04:26.393
"Love makes the heart pine."

1163
01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:53.851
"Don't ever lock eyes with love."

1164
01:04:53.935 --> 01:04:59.351
"Don't make it yours."

1165
01:05:05.518 --> 01:05:11.060
"Don't ever lock eyes with love."

1166
01:05:11.143 --> 01:05:16.643
"Don't make it yours."

1167
01:05:16.726 --> 01:05:22.393
"It won't let you sleep.
It won't let the eyes cry."


1168
01:05:22.476 --> 01:05:25.310
"The night is spent counting stars.

1169
01:05:25.351 --> 01:05:28.143
"Day is spent in yearning."

1170
01:05:28.226 --> 01:05:33.810
"It makes us out of breath."

1171
01:05:33.893 --> 01:05:39.560
"Love makes the heart pine."

1172
01:05:39.643 --> 01:05:45.893
"Love makes the heart pine."

1173
01:05:49.143 --> 01:05:51.060
Thank you. Thank you.

1174
01:05:52.393 --> 01:05:53.935
Cheers. Take it, Lehmber.

1175
01:05:59.268 --> 01:06:01.143
Lehmber, where are you lost?

1176
01:06:01.685 --> 01:06:03.935
Jerry, tell me something.

1177
01:06:04.351 --> 01:06:06.071
In this world,
for every mistake there is...


1178
01:06:06.101 --> 01:06:07.435
a punishment or forgiveness.

1179
01:06:07.768 --> 01:06:11.185
You tell me, should I get punished
or should I apologize?


1180
01:06:11.726 --> 01:06:14.143
Look, bro. You both are
facing punishment.


1181
01:06:14.435 --> 01:06:16.518
But you have to apologize because...

1182
01:06:16.601 --> 01:06:18.518
you have made a mistake, not her.

1183
01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.893
I am ready to apologize. Let's go.

1184
01:06:22.143 --> 01:06:23.685
Listen. Sit down.

1185
01:06:23.851 --> 01:06:25.768
Look, she is very upset.

1186
01:06:26.143 --> 01:06:27.810
If you go to her now...

1187
01:06:28.476 --> 01:06:30.268
she can complain against you.

1188
01:06:30.351 --> 01:06:33.976
You could be deported.
Let them deport me.


1189
01:06:35.393 --> 01:06:37.101
I want to apologize to Ginni.

1190
01:06:37.185 --> 01:06:39.976
Get up.
- Brother, please sit down for a minute.


1191
01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:41.435
Let's sit down and talk.

1192
01:06:41.518 --> 01:06:43.810
You won't get Ginni
if you get deported.


1193
01:06:43.893 --> 01:06:46.851
Have patience. 
Pray to God...

1194
01:06:47.351 --> 01:06:50.976
so that whenever you go to her
and apologize to her...


1195
01:06:51.518 --> 01:06:52.810
she should forgive you.

1196
01:06:53.435 --> 01:06:55.393
Have patience. Don't worry.

1197
01:06:55.601 --> 01:06:57.685
Now take a drink. Relax.

1198
01:07:11.601 --> 01:07:12.893
Hello.

1199
01:07:23.226 --> 01:07:26.226
We have come to apologize to you.

1200
01:07:27.976 --> 01:07:30.351
Lehmber has made a mistake.

1201
01:07:32.018 --> 01:07:34.143
But please forgive him.

1202
01:07:34.518 --> 01:07:36.268
How can I forgive him?

1203
01:07:36.935 --> 01:07:39.768
He trapped my daughter in his lies.

1204
01:07:39.851 --> 01:07:41.893
He played with her emotions.

1205
01:07:42.143 --> 01:07:44.935
I don't want to have
any relationship with the man...


1206
01:07:45.393 --> 01:07:47.810
who has ruined my daughter's life.

1207
01:07:48.601 --> 01:07:51.351
Major, Lehmber has realised
his mistake.


1208
01:07:51.435 --> 01:07:54.393
Lehmber and Ginni love each other.

1209
01:07:55.685 --> 01:07:57.726
Doctor, this isn't called love.

1210
01:07:57.851 --> 01:08:01.685
He wants to get PR by trapping
my daughter in love.


1211
01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:03.560
And you are also helping him.

1212
01:08:03.643 --> 01:08:05.726
That's not true, sir.

1213
01:08:06.685 --> 01:08:10.768
Lehmber is not a bad guy,
but he just like to boast.


1214
01:08:12.226 --> 01:08:14.268
He lies without thinking twice.

1215
01:08:14.351 --> 01:08:17.101
No, it was all planned.

1216
01:08:17.435 --> 01:08:19.601
Thank God I didn't complain
against him.


1217
01:08:20.101 --> 01:08:24.018
Or he would have been deported,
and you would have been charged.


1218
01:08:25.185 --> 01:08:26.643
I am sorry.

1219
01:08:27.351 --> 01:08:30.226
I don't want to have
any relationship with a liar.


1220
01:08:30.310 --> 01:08:33.601
And you are not welcome here again.

1221
01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:34.893
You may leave.

1222
01:08:40.976 --> 01:08:43.976
That's was the only thing left,
and he has done that too.


1223
01:08:44.685 --> 01:08:46.185
You are wise.

1224
01:08:46.268 --> 01:08:48.560
Mom, we came there
for Lehmber's well being.


1225
01:08:48.643 --> 01:08:50.976
What was the need to go to
the girl's house?


1226
01:08:51.143 --> 01:08:53.143
Did you think they will welcome
you with garlands?


1227
01:08:53.726 --> 01:08:55.018
You got insulted.

1228
01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:02.351
Lehmber. Lehmber.

1229
01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:06.268
Lehmber.

1230
01:09:07.268 --> 01:09:08.893
Lehmber, stop.

1231
01:09:19.310 --> 01:09:22.185
You? How dare you...

1232
01:09:22.268 --> 01:09:24.768
step in my house without
my permission?


1233
01:09:24.851 --> 01:09:26.643
If you hadn't been Ginni's father...

1234
01:09:26.726 --> 01:09:28.601
I would have show you my guts.

1235
01:09:28.685 --> 01:09:30.565
Why did you insult my sister
and brother-in-law?


1236
01:09:30.643 --> 01:09:33.685
Do you think I will welcome them
and show hospitality...


1237
01:09:33.726 --> 01:09:36.060
and accepted your marriage proposal?

1238
01:09:36.143 --> 01:09:38.393
Do you think you are so deserving?

1239
01:09:38.476 --> 01:09:40.185
I may or may not be deserving...

1240
01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:43.101
but it was my mistake,
so you should have talked to me.


1241
01:09:43.268 --> 01:09:45.935
We shouldn't talk to those
who stoop low.


1242
01:09:46.226 --> 01:09:48.560
I respected you a lot earlier.

1243
01:09:48.643 --> 01:09:52.518
But now for me you are just
a cheat, liar and a fraud.


1244
01:09:54.226 --> 01:09:56.810
You neither have any status
nor existence.


1245
01:09:56.893 --> 01:09:58.810
You are a big zero.

1246
01:09:59.101 --> 01:10:00.976
The one who can't be
true to himself...


1247
01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:03.810
the one who can't have confidence
in himself...


1248
01:10:03.893 --> 01:10:05.810
how will he belong to someone?

1249
01:10:06.518 --> 01:10:10.268
You are a liar and a cheat.
You can never reform.


1250
01:10:10.351 --> 01:10:13.560
Go away. I don't even want
to see your face.


1251
01:10:13.643 --> 01:10:14.851
Just get out!

1252
01:10:18.101 --> 01:10:26.101
"It is better to break the ties..."

1253
01:10:27.185 --> 01:10:33.560
"with ungrateful friends."

1254
01:10:34.185 --> 01:10:42.185
"Thank God, I realised my folly..."

1255
01:10:43.685 --> 01:10:51.685
"before I had wasted my whole life."

1256
01:10:52.268 --> 01:10:57.935
"You will forget
yourself in these paths."


1257
01:10:58.018 --> 01:11:03.726
"The world will mock you.
You won't find solace in love."


1258
01:11:03.810 --> 01:11:09.351
"It has drowned Sohni in the water."

1259
01:11:09.435 --> 01:11:14.935
"Love makes the heart pine."

1260
01:11:15.226 --> 01:11:21.560
"Love makes the heart pine."

1261
01:11:21.935 --> 01:11:24.893
He won't do anything in his life.
He will just wander around.


1262
01:11:25.268 --> 01:11:27.226
Let's hold a meeting.
He will come back.


1263
01:11:27.726 --> 01:11:30.643
He is a lazy bum.
He doesn't want to do any work.


1264
01:11:30.726 --> 01:11:34.060
He lies all day. He can't do
anything without lying.


1265
01:11:34.226 --> 01:11:36.060
He is not a liar, but worthless.

1266
01:11:36.143 --> 01:11:40.435
You are a liar and a cheat.
You can never reform.


1267
01:11:51.851 --> 01:11:53.143
Hello, mother.

1268
01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:57.393
What is the matter? You called
so early in the morning.


1269
01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.935
Is everything fine?

1270
01:11:59.018 --> 01:12:01.226
Mother, I was missing you.

1271
01:12:02.226 --> 01:12:04.893
So I called up?
Talk to me, son.


1272
01:12:04.976 --> 01:12:07.185
If you talk,
you will feel unburdened.


1273
01:12:07.268 --> 01:12:09.143
From your voice, 
I understood...

1274
01:12:09.476 --> 01:12:11.726
that my son is sad
because of something.


1275
01:12:11.976 --> 01:12:14.768
Look, son. Trust God.

1276
01:12:15.351 --> 01:12:18.518
If we take His name
and tread the path of truth...


1277
01:12:18.726 --> 01:12:20.643
then the paths get cleared.

1278
01:12:20.726 --> 01:12:22.851
Son, you should pray to God.

1279
01:12:23.268 --> 01:12:25.976
All your sorrows will be alleviated.
- Okay.


1280
01:12:26.768 --> 01:12:29.476
Mother, I will call you later.
I am going to sleep.


1281
01:12:39.018 --> 01:12:40.268
Jerry.

1282
01:12:41.351 --> 01:12:43.393
Jerry.
Who is it?


1283
01:12:43.685 --> 01:12:44.685
Lehmber.

1284
01:12:45.268 --> 01:12:46.643
Talk softly.
Come quickly.


1285
01:12:46.726 --> 01:12:48.060
Other people also stay here.

1286
01:12:48.143 --> 01:12:52.101
You will get me evicted.
Who told you to drink so much?


1287
01:12:52.810 --> 01:12:54.685
Brother, I didn't drink too much.

1288
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:56.351
I drank only one bottle.

1289
01:12:56.435 --> 01:12:59.601
Other people also stay here.
You will get me evicted.


1290
01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:02.393
They must be wondering
who has come...


1291
01:13:02.476 --> 01:13:04.476
and from where, so drunk.

1292
01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.393
Do you stay here, fatso?
Yes.


1293
01:13:09.101 --> 01:13:11.935
I somehow manage this place
by working hard.


1294
01:13:12.518 --> 01:13:15.726
How...
- I have to work here day and night.


1295
01:13:30.768 --> 01:13:31.768
Jerry.

1296
01:13:33.351 --> 01:13:35.560
Are you awake, jilted lover?

1297
01:13:36.143 --> 01:13:37.783
Do you remember anything
about last night?


1298
01:13:37.935 --> 01:13:40.726
The way you created a ruckus...

1299
01:13:40.851 --> 01:13:43.018
you would surely get me jailed.

1300
01:13:43.476 --> 01:13:45.393
I have a hangover.

1301
01:13:45.893 --> 01:13:48.643
Should I bring coffee
or liquor again?


1302
01:13:51.143 --> 01:13:52.643
Let's go to the Gurudwara.

1303
01:13:55.643 --> 01:13:58.726
Come on. Get ready.
We will go there.


1304
01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:10.935
What is it?

1305
01:14:11.601 --> 01:14:14.060
Oh my! I see.

1306
01:14:17.101 --> 01:14:19.310
"My beloved."

1307
01:14:19.476 --> 01:14:21.601
So?
Hmm.


1308
01:14:21.851 --> 01:14:22.851
What?

1309
01:14:23.851 --> 01:14:25.518
Oh!

1310
01:14:27.101 --> 01:14:28.268
What work do you do?

1311
01:14:28.351 --> 01:14:31.435
I have to do something to survive.

1312
01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:39.268
You stupid fool!

1313
01:14:39.810 --> 01:14:42.351
Do you come in costume in the park?

1314
01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.268
Return my 30 pounds.

1315
01:14:45.726 --> 01:14:47.810
I will punch you, chimpanzee.

1316
01:14:47.851 --> 01:14:49.331
That's why
I felt you seemed familiar.


1317
01:14:49.393 --> 01:14:52.185
Fatso, my work was spoilt because of you.
- Brother.


1318
01:14:52.351 --> 01:14:55.060
It was because of me,
but because of your own misdeeds.


1319
01:14:55.143 --> 01:14:58.768
If you were honest,
she would have been with you.


1320
01:14:58.851 --> 01:15:01.476
Get lost. Go and get ready quickly.

1321
01:15:01.643 --> 01:15:03.851
We have to go.

1322
01:15:33.476 --> 01:15:34.685
O God!

1323
01:15:35.018 --> 01:15:37.435
Today I have come to apologize
for my mistakes.


1324
01:15:37.518 --> 01:15:39.685
I lied all my life...

1325
01:15:39.851 --> 01:15:43.560
without thinking
that my lies could hurt someone.


1326
01:15:45.351 --> 01:15:47.476
I realised my mistake...

1327
01:15:48.185 --> 01:15:50.768
when I lost my love
because of my lies.


1328
01:15:51.810 --> 01:15:53.018
O God.

1329
01:15:54.143 --> 01:15:57.018
Today I promise in your Gurudwara...

1330
01:15:57.601 --> 01:16:00.185
that hereafter I won't lie.

1331
01:16:00.476 --> 01:16:02.310
Forgive my mistakes.

1332
01:16:02.851 --> 01:16:05.185
And give me strength to tread
the path of truth.


1333
01:16:10.893 --> 01:16:13.768
Today you disturbed God early
in the morning.


1334
01:16:14.143 --> 01:16:15.726
I had an important work with God.

1335
01:16:15.810 --> 01:16:18.810
What was it which could have
been done during the day?


1336
01:16:20.226 --> 01:16:23.935
Jerry, today I made
a pledge in the Gurudwara.


1337
01:16:25.018 --> 01:16:26.768
Hereafter, I won't lie.

1338
01:16:29.643 --> 01:16:30.643
Hey!

1339
01:16:31.018 --> 01:16:33.268
You make wishes seeing
shooting stars.


1340
01:16:33.351 --> 01:16:34.831
Why did you make false
promise to God?


1341
01:16:35.101 --> 01:16:38.435
You can never give up lying.
Bro.


1342
01:16:39.726 --> 01:16:42.018
You know when you get hurt here...

1343
01:16:43.018 --> 01:16:45.393
this stops working.

1344
01:16:46.101 --> 01:16:48.560
And today it has called out to me...

1345
01:16:49.185 --> 01:16:50.393
to quit.

1346
01:16:51.476 --> 01:16:53.060
Enough is enough. Now move on.

1347
01:16:53.518 --> 01:16:55.476
I see. So...

1348
01:16:55.768 --> 01:16:56.869
what do you think about me...

1349
01:16:56.893 --> 01:16:58.268
What is there to think about you?

1350
01:16:59.393 --> 01:17:01.643
You are lowly
and you will stay lowly.


1351
01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:04.393
Even a dried stick is
used by kids to play.


1352
01:17:04.476 --> 01:17:06.185
But you are totally worthless.

1353
01:17:06.268 --> 01:17:08.601
What did you achieve in your life?

1354
01:17:09.351 --> 01:17:12.476
You wear bear's costume to scare
the foreigners.


1355
01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.935
Your acts like beasts.

1356
01:17:20.601 --> 01:17:22.601
But you are pure hearted.

1357
01:17:23.726 --> 01:17:24.726
Come on.

1358
01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:28.893
If I have so many flaws...

1359
01:17:28.976 --> 01:17:30.685
why are we friends?

1360
01:17:30.935 --> 01:17:33.018
Our friendship depends on needs.

1361
01:17:33.351 --> 01:17:35.393
I needed a guy to kill time.

1362
01:17:35.685 --> 01:17:37.435
I made you my friend.

1363
01:17:37.685 --> 01:17:40.976
I need someone for outing,
and you did that.


1364
01:17:41.726 --> 01:17:43.893
And what about all the help
I gave to you?


1365
01:17:44.101 --> 01:17:45.018
Hey!

1366
01:17:45.101 --> 01:17:49.351
We need to someone share food,
liquor and fun...


1367
01:17:51.726 --> 01:17:55.018
Bro, you need a girl for that.

1368
01:17:55.101 --> 01:17:58.268
But you made friendship.
You are so odd.


1369
01:17:58.685 --> 01:18:00.643
Even others never humiliated me
so much...


1370
01:18:00.726 --> 01:18:02.601
as much as my friend did.

1371
01:18:03.185 --> 01:18:05.601
Come on. I will take my leave.

1372
01:18:06.018 --> 01:18:07.060
See you.
What?


1373
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:09.893
Hello. Where are you
going leaving me?


1374
01:18:10.893 --> 01:18:13.601
You are not the only ones
I know in this world.


1375
01:18:14.226 --> 01:18:15.268
Hey!

1376
01:18:21.143 --> 01:18:23.435
The way I have tied
your hair today...


1377
01:18:23.518 --> 01:18:25.851
Look. You have become Singh.

1378
01:18:26.351 --> 01:18:27.685
Aunt.

1379
01:18:27.768 --> 01:18:30.643
You are so decked up.
Are you going to a fashion show?


1380
01:18:30.726 --> 01:18:33.518
I am not old for wearing make up.

1381
01:18:33.643 --> 01:18:34.893
I am only 17.

1382
01:18:34.976 --> 01:18:37.810
You are not 17 but 70.

1383
01:18:37.893 --> 01:18:40.351
Kelly.
Hey, Candy. I am coming.


1384
01:18:40.685 --> 01:18:41.685
Candy.

1385
01:18:46.185 --> 01:18:48.935
How are you aunt Candy?
Fine.


1386
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:51.976
Hello, Candy. How are you?

1387
01:18:52.518 --> 01:18:54.351
Hi, Kelly.
You guys enjoy.


1388
01:18:54.601 --> 01:18:55.518
Where is Dr Avtaar?

1389
01:18:55.601 --> 01:18:57.726
He is not at home.
He is on vacation.


1390
01:18:58.226 --> 01:18:59.518
Aunt is also lying.

1391
01:18:59.768 --> 01:19:02.351
On vacation? Seriously.
Where is he gone?


1392
01:19:04.101 --> 01:19:05.351
Now what?
Let's go.


1393
01:19:08.268 --> 01:19:11.143
Brother-in-law,
some people have come in suits.


1394
01:19:13.726 --> 01:19:16.268
Lehmber, they would be bankers.
Tell them I am not home.


1395
01:19:16.351 --> 01:19:18.601
First aunt lied to them.

1396
01:19:19.101 --> 01:19:20.768
Now you are asking me to lie.

1397
01:19:21.268 --> 01:19:22.268
I can't lie.

1398
01:19:22.351 --> 01:19:24.518
Now do you have trouble lying?

1399
01:19:24.643 --> 01:19:26.643
You lie all the time.
It is nothing new for you.


1400
01:19:26.726 --> 01:19:28.143
It was different earlier.

1401
01:19:29.685 --> 01:19:31.976
I can't lie now.

1402
01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:34.101
Even Gavy is sitting in the front.

1403
01:19:34.935 --> 01:19:37.476
Gavy, go inside.
Hmm.


1404
01:19:39.685 --> 01:19:41.560
Now tell them I am not home.

1405
01:19:41.851 --> 01:19:43.976
I couldn't pay
the instalment because of you.


1406
01:19:44.226 --> 01:19:46.935
Because of your mess.
That's why they have come.


1407
01:19:47.518 --> 01:19:49.518
Tell them I am not home. Go.

1408
01:19:57.518 --> 01:20:00.101
Yes. - We have come from
the bank to meet Dr Avtaar.


1409
01:20:01.601 --> 01:20:03.935
Dr Avtaar Singh. 
My brother-in-law.

1410
01:20:04.810 --> 01:20:06.726
You mean my sister's husband.

1411
01:20:06.810 --> 01:20:09.351
Yes. - Your sister's husband.
Where is he?


1412
01:20:10.435 --> 01:20:12.185
I don't know. Come after a few days.

1413
01:20:12.643 --> 01:20:14.976
You can call him up.
His phone is switched off.


1414
01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:16.643
Tell us, where is Dr Avtaar?

1415
01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:18.143
Huh?

1416
01:20:18.726 --> 01:20:20.476
Brother-in-law is getting
ready inside.


1417
01:20:20.518 --> 01:20:23.393
He told me to tell you that
he isn't home.


1418
01:20:24.226 --> 01:20:26.101
Okay.
Yeah.


1419
01:20:30.851 --> 01:20:32.851
Lehmber, did they leave?

1420
01:20:34.143 --> 01:20:36.768
No, brother-in-law.
They didn't go. They have come in.


1421
01:20:38.643 --> 01:20:40.060
I am really sorry, sir.

1422
01:20:40.518 --> 01:20:41.685
I was just joking.

1423
01:20:41.976 --> 01:20:44.018
Sorry.
- Doctor, we didn't expect this from you.


1424
01:20:44.101 --> 01:20:45.301
You are a professional person.

1425
01:20:45.351 --> 01:20:46.643
Since the last ten months...

1426
01:20:46.726 --> 01:20:49.185
you have no paid EMI of the house,
and now you are lying.


1427
01:20:49.601 --> 01:20:50.935
You will have to pay double fine.

1428
01:20:51.018 --> 01:20:53.935
Again I am really sorry, sir.
I was busy.


1429
01:20:54.018 --> 01:20:57.060
But I will pay it tomorrow
definitely. It is my promise.


1430
01:20:59.101 --> 01:21:00.810
Sir, please don't fine him.

1431
01:21:00.893 --> 01:21:02.810
Please. Forgive him
for my sake. Look.


1432
01:21:03.101 --> 01:21:05.768
I could have lied to you that
he isn't home.


1433
01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.851
But I told you the truth. Please.

1434
01:21:08.935 --> 01:21:11.851
Bro, you are honest.
We will spare him this time.


1435
01:21:11.935 --> 01:21:14.018
Doctor, don't make a mistake again.

1436
01:21:14.101 --> 01:21:15.393
Especially such a one.

1437
01:21:15.643 --> 01:21:18.726
Thank you so much. I really
appreciate that. Thank you.


1438
01:21:19.810 --> 01:21:20.851
Okay, let's go.

1439
01:21:37.268 --> 01:21:38.476
Dear.

1440
01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:40.518
I asked you something a while ago.

1441
01:21:40.851 --> 01:21:42.060
Have you thought about it?

1442
01:21:44.893 --> 01:21:45.893
Look.

1443
01:21:46.143 --> 01:21:48.060
Your silence isn't
the answer to my question.


1444
01:21:48.143 --> 01:21:50.518
You have to think about the future.

1445
01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:55.185
Dad, what do you think about
the future? Dad, I am doing a job.


1446
01:21:55.268 --> 01:21:58.393
You know very well what
I want to say.


1447
01:21:58.476 --> 01:22:00.768
I accept...

1448
01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:02.351
that you were cheated.

1449
01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:04.560
It happened with me too.

1450
01:22:06.476 --> 01:22:09.893
Life doesn't end if we stumble once.

1451
01:22:10.476 --> 01:22:12.560
On the contrary,
it makes a new start.


1452
01:22:14.393 --> 01:22:16.893
I will find such
a suitor for my daughter...


1453
01:22:17.768 --> 01:22:19.351
who will always keep you happy.

1454
01:22:21.018 --> 01:22:23.518
It is very difficult
to pass life alone.


1455
01:22:36.601 --> 01:22:39.935
Lehmber, couldn't you say
a small lie?


1456
01:22:40.518 --> 01:22:42.601
You should have said
your brother-in-law was home.


1457
01:22:43.768 --> 01:22:45.851
No, sister. I have decided.

1458
01:22:45.935 --> 01:22:47.643
I will never lie in my life again...

1459
01:22:47.935 --> 01:22:49.726
even if I have
to incur a big loss.

1460
01:22:50.185 --> 01:22:52.601
God has given me a chance to reform.

1461
01:22:53.768 --> 01:22:55.935
Don't let this opportunity slip.

1462
01:22:56.435 --> 01:22:57.935
You have lost so many chances.

1463
01:22:58.393 --> 01:23:00.268
Nobody gets so many in UK.

1464
01:23:01.518 --> 01:23:04.060
God has given you another chance.

1465
01:23:04.518 --> 01:23:06.393
Listen to me carefully.

1466
01:23:07.518 --> 01:23:09.476
I have talked to Stella for you.

1467
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:13.726
Go and meet her. And just agree
to whatever she says.


1468
01:23:14.351 --> 01:23:16.476
Okay?
Okay, sir.


1469
01:23:17.643 --> 01:23:19.185
I will meet her.

1470
01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:26.101
Hello.
- Hi, Lehmber. Please have a seat.


1471
01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:34.060
Lehmber, I am so happy that you came
to meet me on Rimpi's behest.


1472
01:23:34.476 --> 01:23:35.976
It is nothing like that.

1473
01:23:36.393 --> 01:23:38.768
I need a job and...

1474
01:23:38.851 --> 01:23:42.768
I will work hard, day and night.

1475
01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:45.226
I am even ready for over time.

1476
01:23:45.476 --> 01:23:47.435
If you say,
I won't take leave even on Sundays.


1477
01:23:48.226 --> 01:23:50.393
Didn't Rimpi tell me
why I called you here?


1478
01:23:50.726 --> 01:23:52.976
No. She didn't say anything.

1479
01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:54.726
But you would have called me
for a job.


1480
01:23:55.351 --> 01:23:58.143
No. There is something
more than that.


1481
01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:02.601
What do you mean?
- Lehmber, I am noticing you since a long time.


1482
01:24:03.185 --> 01:24:04.185
I really like you.

1483
01:24:04.518 --> 01:24:06.310
I want us to get married...

1484
01:24:06.393 --> 01:24:08.893
and you should become my life
partner and business partner.


1485
01:24:09.601 --> 01:24:12.101
You know what.
Lehmber, I am UK citizen.


1486
01:24:12.393 --> 01:24:15.060
I have my own house and business.

1487
01:24:15.768 --> 01:24:17.351
It will be ours.

1488
01:24:17.685 --> 01:24:19.726
And we can lead a good life.

1489
01:24:31.810 --> 01:24:33.435
Sorry, Stella.

1490
01:24:34.476 --> 01:24:37.643
I am in love with someone else.

1491
01:24:38.018 --> 01:24:41.018
And I can't think of
anyone else now.


1492
01:24:41.768 --> 01:24:45.935
Anyway, we can't be happy
if our hearts are not one.


1493
01:24:46.226 --> 01:24:47.601
Our hearts will unite, Lehmber.

1494
01:24:47.976 --> 01:24:50.096
If you are not stressed out
about looking for a job...


1495
01:24:50.601 --> 01:24:51.976
or about PR...

1496
01:24:52.435 --> 01:24:55.518
then life will be easy, and
gradually you will fall in love.


1497
01:24:57.726 --> 01:25:00.476
Stella, I accept that I want PR...

1498
01:25:00.935 --> 01:25:02.310
and I also need a job.

1499
01:25:03.685 --> 01:25:06.268
I won't get PR so easily.

1500
01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:08.435
And I will have to try
hard to get a job.


1501
01:25:10.976 --> 01:25:12.101
But sorry...

1502
01:25:14.226 --> 01:25:16.060
my heart can't forget her.

1503
01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:14.851
Calm down, dear.

1504
01:26:15.810 --> 01:26:16.810
No.

1505
01:26:16.893 --> 01:26:17.893
Don't cry, dear.

1506
01:26:21.726 --> 01:26:23.018
What happened?

1507
01:26:23.393 --> 01:26:25.476
Is everything fine?
Fine?


1508
01:26:25.601 --> 01:26:28.393
You make a mistake and you ask us.

1509
01:26:30.810 --> 01:26:33.268
I never raised my voice
in front of anyone.


1510
01:26:33.601 --> 01:26:35.393
I never hurt anyone.

1511
01:26:36.018 --> 01:26:37.726
Since I came in this house...

1512
01:26:38.185 --> 01:26:39.851
I respected you as my God.

1513
01:26:40.268 --> 01:26:42.268
I revered you.

1514
01:26:42.351 --> 01:26:44.810
I didn't know you would
stoop so low.


1515
01:26:44.893 --> 01:26:46.268
Stoop low?

1516
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:49.560
I am standing in front of you.
Will you tell me what happened?


1517
01:26:49.643 --> 01:26:52.060
Today with which girl were you
strolling with hand in hand?


1518
01:26:52.393 --> 01:26:54.643
With which girl was
I strolling with hand in hand?


1519
01:26:54.726 --> 01:26:56.560
Have you lost your mind?

1520
01:26:56.643 --> 01:26:59.226
Where did you see me?
I saw you.


1521
01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.685
You gave a bouquet to
a girl in the restaurant.


1522
01:27:01.768 --> 01:27:04.560
Aren't you ashamed to ruin
your sister's married life?


1523
01:27:05.310 --> 01:27:06.643
You should be ashamed.

1524
01:27:06.726 --> 01:27:08.643
You were going out with
some other girl.


1525
01:27:08.726 --> 01:27:09.726
You!

1526
01:27:10.268 --> 01:27:11.268
Brother-in-law.

1527
01:27:14.393 --> 01:27:16.310
Lehmber.

1528
01:27:18.268 --> 01:27:19.393
No.

1529
01:27:19.851 --> 01:27:21.560
She was my patient.

1530
01:27:22.393 --> 01:27:24.351
She is at the last stage of cancer.

1531
01:27:24.435 --> 01:27:27.143
I do counseling for her.

1532
01:27:27.226 --> 01:27:28.226
Do you think...

1533
01:27:28.435 --> 01:27:30.601
I will go out with her?

1534
01:27:30.685 --> 01:27:33.351
I saw you. I
told here what I saw.

1535
01:27:33.643 --> 01:27:35.268
You don't have any brains.

1536
01:27:35.768 --> 01:27:38.143
If you had any brains...

1537
01:27:38.226 --> 01:27:40.393
you should have got a job by now.

1538
01:27:40.476 --> 01:27:41.685
Never mind, son.

1539
01:27:41.976 --> 01:27:43.601
He would have been mistaken.

1540
01:27:43.685 --> 01:27:46.935
Mom, be quiet.
Since he came to our house...


1541
01:27:47.310 --> 01:27:49.476
he has made our life miserable.

1542
01:27:49.726 --> 01:27:51.476
He creates a new mess every time.

1543
01:27:51.810 --> 01:27:54.143
I built a reputation
in all these years...


1544
01:27:54.726 --> 01:27:56.101
but he has spoilt it.

1545
01:27:57.101 --> 01:27:59.643
If he stay here any longer...

1546
01:27:59.893 --> 01:28:03.185
God knows what more trouble
he will invite for us.


1547
01:28:04.601 --> 01:28:07.268
Brother-in-law, I didn't know
you thought that about me.


1548
01:28:08.018 --> 01:28:09.476
I can go any minute.

1549
01:28:09.601 --> 01:28:10.685
You should have told me.

1550
01:28:10.768 --> 01:28:13.643
We have to say it to
the one who has self respect.


1551
01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:16.351
But you have no self respect.

1552
01:28:16.435 --> 01:28:18.726
If you have any dignity...

1553
01:28:19.226 --> 01:28:21.101
then leave my house.

1554
01:28:21.601 --> 01:28:22.601
Get out!

1555
01:28:22.768 --> 01:28:24.685
Go!
Lehmber.


1556
01:28:33.143 --> 01:28:35.851
Lehmber, don't be offended by
what your brother-in-law said.


1557
01:28:35.935 --> 01:28:37.268
Let him go.

1558
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:39.351
I will make sure nobody
gives him shelter.


1559
01:29:11.851 --> 01:29:12.976
"O traveller."

1560
01:29:13.143 --> 01:29:14.684
"After the fall of dusk."
Uncle.


1561
01:29:14.685 --> 01:29:17.893
"O traveller."

1562
01:29:22.601 --> 01:29:23.726
"O traveller."

1563
01:29:25.268 --> 01:29:28.351
"O traveller."

1564
01:29:28.643 --> 01:29:36.643
"Continue the journey of life,
all alone."


1565
01:29:38.685 --> 01:29:44.726
"O traveller."

1566
01:29:44.810 --> 01:29:50.726
"Keep marching, O traveller."

1567
01:29:52.268 --> 01:29:54.976
"The caravan moves on."

1568
01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:57.601
"Nobody is our own or an outsider."

1569
01:29:57.685 --> 01:30:00.226
"The one who has created
this world...


1570
01:30:00.268 --> 01:30:05.893
we have no enmity with
that creator."


1571
01:30:05.976 --> 01:30:13.976
"You will get
what your destined for."


1572
01:30:16.018 --> 01:30:20.226
"O traveller."

1573
01:30:20.268 --> 01:30:22.351
"O traveller."

1574
01:30:22.435 --> 01:30:28.185
"Keep marching, O traveller."

1575
01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:32.768
Lehmber, at this hour?

1576
01:30:33.476 --> 01:30:35.976
Friend, did you do some scam?

1577
01:30:36.726 --> 01:30:38.560
I didn't do anything.

1578
01:30:39.893 --> 01:30:41.268
I have left my sister's house.

1579
01:30:41.810 --> 01:30:42.810
It had to happen.

1580
01:30:43.476 --> 01:30:46.101
The relatives don't let
you stay here for long.


1581
01:30:46.935 --> 01:30:48.268
I knew that...

1582
01:30:48.768 --> 01:30:51.185
you would come to me some day.

1583
01:30:51.435 --> 01:30:52.768
You have come now.

1584
01:30:53.685 --> 01:30:54.685
Tell me...

1585
01:30:55.226 --> 01:30:56.726
what do you think about me?

1586
01:30:58.268 --> 01:31:01.893
What is there to think?
You were lowly and you still are.


1587
01:31:02.435 --> 01:31:04.101
Did you get PR?

1588
01:31:04.185 --> 01:31:06.268
Did buy a house or marry
a foreigner?


1589
01:31:06.685 --> 01:31:09.351
You will do the same job as before.

1590
01:31:09.851 --> 01:31:12.268
If I am so lowly,
why did you come to me?


1591
01:31:12.351 --> 01:31:14.071
My brother-in-law drove me
out of his house.


1592
01:31:14.226 --> 01:31:15.476
That's why I came here.

1593
01:31:16.143 --> 01:31:19.268
Do you think I will let you in
after hearing all this?


1594
01:31:19.810 --> 01:31:20.893
Hmm.

1595
01:31:21.601 --> 01:31:23.226
Look, I have come to you.

1596
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:25.726
You are pure hearted.

1597
01:31:27.310 --> 01:31:28.893
Come on in.

1598
01:31:34.226 --> 01:31:35.601
I will let you stay here.

1599
01:31:35.893 --> 01:31:37.435
Because you are a good hearted guy.

1600
01:31:37.893 --> 01:31:38.893
And honest also.

1601
01:31:38.935 --> 01:31:42.018
But to stay here,
you have to pay half the rent.


1602
01:31:42.268 --> 01:31:44.143
And you have to arrange
for your meals.


1603
01:31:44.851 --> 01:31:46.226
Never mind, bro. I will do it.

1604
01:31:46.268 --> 01:31:48.018
You will do it, but how?

1605
01:31:48.643 --> 01:31:50.226
You don't get a job.

1606
01:31:50.268 --> 01:31:52.393
If you get a job...

1607
01:31:52.476 --> 01:31:53.893
you fight there and quit.

1608
01:31:54.268 --> 01:31:55.726
Bro, I will find a job.

1609
01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.560
Now I have to do a job.
There is no other way out.


1610
01:31:59.268 --> 01:32:00.935
I have a suggestion for you.

1611
01:32:01.018 --> 01:32:03.726
Whenever you are free,
you should come with me...


1612
01:32:04.226 --> 01:32:05.351
disguised as monkey.

1613
01:32:06.018 --> 01:32:07.018
What are you doing?

1614
01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:10.768
I will ask JD sir.
I can't wear costumes.


1615
01:32:11.643 --> 01:32:13.393
I will find a job for myself.

1616
01:32:13.685 --> 01:32:15.518
Okay, fine. As you wish.

1617
01:32:22.935 --> 01:32:24.226
Come on in.

1618
01:32:27.643 --> 01:32:31.060
Sir. - Are you
the one who came with Dr Avtaar?


1619
01:32:31.685 --> 01:32:32.851
Why are you here now?

1620
01:32:33.185 --> 01:32:34.518
I want a job.

1621
01:32:34.601 --> 01:32:36.101
Didn't I tell you the other day...

1622
01:32:36.351 --> 01:32:37.601
we don't have a job for you?

1623
01:32:37.893 --> 01:32:40.268
Sir, please.
There is no vacancy. Go.


1624
01:32:40.976 --> 01:32:42.351
Please.
Just leave.


1625
01:33:00.851 --> 01:33:01.976
Bro.
Yes, Jerry.


1626
01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:04.101
I have sent you a location.

1627
01:33:04.393 --> 01:33:06.393
There is a vacancy in a restaurant.

1628
01:33:06.726 --> 01:33:08.768
If you go, you may get the job.

1629
01:33:08.851 --> 01:33:10.560
Okay. I will go.

1630
01:33:13.726 --> 01:33:14.976
Did you work before?

1631
01:33:15.601 --> 01:33:17.601
Yes, sir. I did a few jobs.

1632
01:33:17.976 --> 01:33:19.296
How much experience have you got?

1633
01:33:19.726 --> 01:33:21.976
Sir, 2-3 days.

1634
01:33:22.393 --> 01:33:24.393
2-3 days. Were you fired?

1635
01:33:25.226 --> 01:33:28.393
Sir, I was fired
because of my mistakes.


1636
01:33:28.476 --> 01:33:30.185
Should I make
a mistake by hiring you?


1637
01:33:30.601 --> 01:33:31.435
Sir, please.

1638
01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:33.726
Get out of here.
Sir, please. Get out.


1639
01:33:36.976 --> 01:33:39.101
If you want to progress,
do some business.


1640
01:33:39.185 --> 01:33:42.351
Had I been in your place,
I would have become the owner.


1641
01:33:44.101 --> 01:33:45.601
What is happening?
Sorry.


1642
01:33:45.685 --> 01:33:47.685
Is this the way to talk to someone?
I am sorry.


1643
01:33:47.768 --> 01:33:49.060
Just go inside.
Okay.


1644
01:33:50.226 --> 01:33:51.226
Brother.

1645
01:33:51.851 --> 01:33:52.935
What's your name?

1646
01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:54.643
Lehmber.

1647
01:33:54.768 --> 01:33:55.810
Are you all right?
Yes.


1648
01:33:56.185 --> 01:33:58.185
Brother, let's sit inside and chat.

1649
01:33:58.685 --> 01:34:01.810
Lehmber, maybe you don't
remember, but I do.


1650
01:34:02.435 --> 01:34:03.726
Once you told me...

1651
01:34:04.476 --> 01:34:05.976
how long will you just be a manager?

1652
01:34:06.393 --> 01:34:07.851
Will you become an owner or not?

1653
01:34:08.643 --> 01:34:10.726
Your words pierced my heart.

1654
01:34:11.101 --> 01:34:12.935
And that day I decided...

1655
01:34:13.226 --> 01:34:15.143
to start my own business.

1656
01:34:15.226 --> 01:34:18.726
Since that day, I toiled hard
and got this success.


1657
01:34:20.185 --> 01:34:21.768
How did you like the place?

1658
01:34:22.935 --> 01:34:24.393
Very good. Very nice.

1659
01:34:24.476 --> 01:34:27.018
It is my restaurant.
It is because of you.


1660
01:34:27.101 --> 01:34:29.893
So I am thankful to you.

1661
01:34:29.976 --> 01:34:32.101
So tell me, what
can I do for you?

1662
01:34:32.351 --> 01:34:33.643
I wanted a job.

1663
01:34:33.726 --> 01:34:37.226
I can't cook, but I can take order.

1664
01:34:37.435 --> 01:34:40.476
Yellow lentil,
black lentil, chickpeas, curry...


1665
01:34:40.601 --> 01:34:42.143
Enough. Enough. Enough.

1666
01:34:42.435 --> 01:34:43.518
Lehmber, enough.

1667
01:34:43.601 --> 01:34:44.810
This is an Italian restaurant.

1668
01:34:44.893 --> 01:34:46.518
Okay? Your job is confirmed.

1669
01:34:46.893 --> 01:34:48.018
You can join from tomorrow.

1670
01:34:48.101 --> 01:34:49.577
Thank you. Thank you.
It is all right.


1671
01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:50.726
Thank you so much.

1672
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:52.560
You are welcome. Okay?

1673
01:34:52.643 --> 01:34:53.643
See you.

1674
01:34:55.476 --> 01:34:57.060
Mother asked me
to tread the right path.


1675
01:34:57.851 --> 01:35:00.268
God has blessed me. I will give
the good news to mother.


1676
01:35:10.185 --> 01:35:12.935
Mother, hello.
Hello, son. Is everything fine?


1677
01:35:13.018 --> 01:35:14.143
It is very good.

1678
01:35:14.226 --> 01:35:16.101
I got a job.

1679
01:35:16.185 --> 01:35:18.268
Really? That is a good news.

1680
01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:21.310
Son, work hard.
Don't worry about us.


1681
01:35:21.893 --> 01:35:24.101
Yes, mother.
I will hard with dedication.


1682
01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:26.851
Okay, mother. I will talk to you later.
- Take care.


1683
01:35:36.935 --> 01:35:41.185
"Step out and start a new journey."

1684
01:35:41.226 --> 01:35:45.560
"Come and observe
the nature in daylight."


1685
01:35:45.643 --> 01:35:49.685
"If you try,
you will find the destination."


1686
01:35:49.768 --> 01:35:55.685
"You will get
what is in your destiny."


1687
01:35:55.768 --> 01:36:02.518
"Praise the Lord."

1688
01:36:10.393 --> 01:36:14.560
"You have to enter the arena
and face the opponents."


1689
01:36:14.643 --> 01:36:18.643
"You have to fight your own battle.
Pick up your swords."


1690
01:36:18.726 --> 01:36:22.226
"Don't retreat. Don't lose."

1691
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:28.976
"Keep fighting. 
It is do or die."

1692
01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:33.643
"Change your luck."

1693
01:36:39.101 --> 01:36:43.643
"Don't underestimate yourself."

1694
01:36:43.726 --> 01:36:47.893
"Create something new to
impress the people."


1695
01:36:47.976 --> 01:36:51.935
"Don't be depressed.
Reach out to the destination."


1696
01:36:52.018 --> 01:36:58.268
"Tell the new generation
how to rise again."


1697
01:36:58.351 --> 01:37:04.101
"Be victorious."

1698
01:37:08.685 --> 01:37:13.268
"Rock on."

1699
01:37:14.518 --> 01:37:16.476
Hmm. There.

1700
01:37:20.976 --> 01:37:22.851
Lehmber. How is it going?

1701
01:37:23.018 --> 01:37:24.298
Everything is fine.
Good, good.


1702
01:37:24.351 --> 01:37:27.518
Listen. My important
guests are coming.


1703
01:37:27.601 --> 01:37:29.560
You see the centre table outside.
- Yes.


1704
01:37:29.643 --> 01:37:31.435
Please get it ready quickly.
Okay. Okay?


1705
01:37:31.518 --> 01:37:32.518
Good.
Yes.


1706
01:37:36.601 --> 01:37:38.643
Hello, uncle.
Hello, son.


1707
01:37:39.101 --> 01:37:40.310
Please take your seat.
Okay.


1708
01:37:40.393 --> 01:37:41.685
Thank you.
Please.


1709
01:37:43.851 --> 01:37:45.435
Dear.

1710
01:37:45.893 --> 01:37:47.018
He is Gurbash.

1711
01:37:47.476 --> 01:37:48.893
And she is my daughter.

1712
01:37:48.976 --> 01:37:50.851
Ginni.
Hello.


1713
01:37:51.643 --> 01:37:52.643
Hello.

1714
01:37:53.476 --> 01:37:55.101
You two sit and talk.

1715
01:37:55.185 --> 01:37:57.105
After all, you have to spend
your lives together.


1716
01:37:57.685 --> 01:38:00.643
I will go and see the restaurant.
- Dad.


1717
01:38:00.935 --> 01:38:03.601
Dear, try to understand.

1718
01:38:03.685 --> 01:38:07.560
Uncle, I guess Ginni is
feeling uncomfortable.


1719
01:38:07.810 --> 01:38:08.893
Hmm.

1720
01:38:12.268 --> 01:38:20.268
"Don't lock eyes with love."

1721
01:38:20.351 --> 01:38:21.810
Excuse me.

1722
01:38:21.893 --> 01:38:25.060
"My friend, don't ever..."

1723
01:38:25.143 --> 01:38:26.726
Oh, Lehmber.

1724
01:38:26.810 --> 01:38:28.810
Let it be. They have left.

1725
01:38:29.018 --> 01:38:32.143
Listen. That girl's name is Ginni.

1726
01:38:32.226 --> 01:38:33.560
And I am getting married to her.

1727
01:38:34.185 --> 01:38:35.810
She was going to marry someone...

1728
01:38:35.893 --> 01:38:37.726
but that boy was a cheat.

1729
01:38:38.018 --> 01:38:40.393
So Ginni is tense these days.

1730
01:38:40.685 --> 01:38:42.393
Anyway, you carry on.

1731
01:38:43.393 --> 01:38:51.393
Love is the one
that makes the herat suffer

1732
01:38:56.935 --> 01:39:00.601
You read books,
but you should follow it too.


1733
01:39:01.601 --> 01:39:05.518
Dear, I took you to meet Gurbaaz...

1734
01:39:05.601 --> 01:39:08.143
so that you can forget your past.

1735
01:39:10.976 --> 01:39:12.935
Dad, I am not a kid...

1736
01:39:13.018 --> 01:39:15.060
that you can take me anyway,
holding my hand.


1737
01:39:15.643 --> 01:39:17.851
You should have told me
where we were going...


1738
01:39:17.935 --> 01:39:20.351
and for what? I
may not like to go.

1739
01:39:21.018 --> 01:39:24.976
That's why I didn't tell you.
I knew you would have refused.


1740
01:39:26.101 --> 01:39:29.226
I think Gurbash is
the right choice for you.


1741
01:39:30.018 --> 01:39:32.018
He is a handsome guy.

1742
01:39:32.185 --> 01:39:34.601
And he has built a restaurant,
with his hard work.


1743
01:39:36.268 --> 01:39:38.518
He will always keep you happy.

1744
01:39:40.685 --> 01:39:42.810
Now it is up to you.

1745
01:39:42.893 --> 01:39:45.351
I can not say anything more.

1746
01:39:55.601 --> 01:39:57.601
He has got a good job.

1747
01:40:00.143 --> 01:40:03.435
Lehmber, won't you even
talk to your sister?


1748
01:40:08.143 --> 01:40:09.851
You are still offended.

1749
01:40:09.935 --> 01:40:12.393
No, sister. It is nothing like that.

1750
01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:14.143
So why didn't you come home?

1751
01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:16.476
You should have come for
a cup of tea.


1752
01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:21.226
I was busy with work.

1753
01:40:21.726 --> 01:40:23.226
So I didn't get time.

1754
01:40:23.268 --> 01:40:26.185
I know my brother works very hard.

1755
01:40:26.435 --> 01:40:28.018
He does double shifts.

1756
01:40:29.601 --> 01:40:32.143
Lehmber, come home.
We have come to get you.


1757
01:40:32.726 --> 01:40:35.268
No, brother-in-law. 
I am fine here.

1758
01:40:35.643 --> 01:40:37.601
Lehmber, please forget
the past disputes.


1759
01:40:37.768 --> 01:40:39.518
Will you make me apologize to you?

1760
01:40:39.601 --> 01:40:42.518
No, brother-in-law.
It is nothing like that.


1761
01:40:42.810 --> 01:40:44.435
I have learnt from you...

1762
01:40:44.518 --> 01:40:45.726
how to live my life.

1763
01:40:47.018 --> 01:40:51.351
Now I feel I am fine here.

1764
01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:53.393
I am used to living alone.

1765
01:40:54.810 --> 01:40:58.476
Lehmber, you shouldn't stay
alone for too long.


1766
01:41:00.101 --> 01:41:02.476
Stella is a very nice girl.

1767
01:41:03.435 --> 01:41:05.810
If you agree to marry her...

1768
01:41:06.351 --> 01:41:08.685
all the problems will be solved.

1769
01:41:09.185 --> 01:41:11.643
Yours and ours also.

1770
01:41:12.226 --> 01:41:15.018
Lehmber, we have taken
loan from Stella...


1771
01:41:15.101 --> 01:41:16.768
because I couldn't repay
the house loans.


1772
01:41:16.851 --> 01:41:18.143
So we have to pay her back.

1773
01:41:18.185 --> 01:41:21.518
She is upset with us, as
we didn't get you married to her.


1774
01:41:22.268 --> 01:41:24.310
Even my job is uncertain.

1775
01:41:26.601 --> 01:41:29.268
Bro, listen to them.
Your life will be made.


1776
01:41:29.435 --> 01:41:32.726
You know, only lucky ones
get Red passport.


1777
01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:36.185
Our family gives only good advice.

1778
01:41:36.976 --> 01:41:39.393
My brother, please say yes.

1779
01:41:39.643 --> 01:41:42.893
We have come with respect.
We have high hopes from you.


1780
01:41:46.143 --> 01:41:47.185
Okay.

1781
01:41:56.601 --> 01:41:57.768
Hi, Lehmber.

1782
01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:00.185
Hi.
This is for you.


1783
01:42:01.601 --> 01:42:04.119
Thank you.
- I am so happy and excited that you agreed to marry me.


1784
01:42:04.143 --> 01:42:06.018
You know what.
You don't need to do this work.


1785
01:42:06.101 --> 01:42:09.268
Next week, you are going to be
the owner of a very big company.


1786
01:42:11.476 --> 01:42:13.851
I have said yes for the marriage,
not to quit my job.


1787
01:42:13.935 --> 01:42:17.810
Anyway, I want to become
a self made man.


1788
01:42:17.976 --> 01:42:20.185
That's what I like about you.

1789
01:42:20.268 --> 01:42:22.768
Okay, keep up with
your work. Carry on.


1790
01:42:23.018 --> 01:42:24.893
Next week, Rimpi and I...

1791
01:42:24.976 --> 01:42:27.185
have fixed
the wedding date on Sunday.


1792
01:42:27.393 --> 01:42:29.101
So please take leave from the job.

1793
01:42:29.393 --> 01:42:33.143
Because we have to do lots of shopping and preparations.
- Okay.


1794
01:42:33.476 --> 01:42:34.935
I will take my leave.

1795
01:42:35.101 --> 01:42:36.893
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Bye.


1796
01:42:47.226 --> 01:42:48.268
Lehmber.

1797
01:42:49.726 --> 01:42:51.310
What a good choice!

1798
01:42:51.851 --> 01:42:53.768
You have found an amazing girl.

1799
01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:56.018
She is one of the richest lady.

1800
01:42:56.268 --> 01:42:57.185
And citizen also.

1801
01:42:57.226 --> 01:42:59.976
If I had got this option,
I too would have said yes.


1802
01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:05.143
Don't worry. Just kidding.

1803
01:43:05.185 --> 01:43:06.976
You will get your PR for sure.

1804
01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:08.185
Congratulations.

1805
01:43:08.893 --> 01:43:12.560
I wanted an advice from you.

1806
01:43:13.476 --> 01:43:15.851
Ginni is very sad.

1807
01:43:16.435 --> 01:43:19.518
I don't understand what to gift her.

1808
01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:23.060
Everyone has
their own individual choice.


1809
01:43:23.518 --> 01:43:27.351
Still, you would know better.
You seem like a lover boy.


1810
01:43:30.185 --> 01:43:33.643
I think happiness is more
important in life.


1811
01:43:34.393 --> 01:43:35.685
Give her a smiley.

1812
01:43:36.726 --> 01:43:37.851
Smiley.

1813
01:43:38.810 --> 01:43:40.351
Sweet and simple.

1814
01:43:40.726 --> 01:43:41.726
Hmm.

1815
01:43:42.185 --> 01:43:43.310
Very good idea. Thank you.

1816
01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:44.726
Keep up the good work.

1817
01:43:49.435 --> 01:43:55.768
"Two earthen lamps."

1818
01:43:55.851 --> 01:44:01.893
"Two earthen lamps."

1819
01:44:01.976 --> 01:44:08.560
"I have lit with a prayer."

1820
01:44:08.643 --> 01:44:13.601
"I have lit with a prayer
that you lead a long life."


1821
01:44:13.685 --> 01:44:20.018
"Live a long life."

1822
01:44:22.268 --> 01:44:29.226
"O beloved.
You embark on a new journey."


1823
01:44:29.310 --> 01:44:35.476
"But please don't forget me."

1824
01:44:35.685 --> 01:44:40.893
"O beloved."

1825
01:44:42.143 --> 01:44:48.685
"With kohl, your eyes shine bright."

1826
01:44:48.726 --> 01:44:54.893
"You are one in a million."

1827
01:44:54.976 --> 01:45:01.351
"The sun bows seeing
your glowing beauty."


1828
01:45:01.435 --> 01:45:04.851
"Everything else is pale."

1829
01:45:04.935 --> 01:45:10.935
"But please don't forget me."

1830
01:45:11.018 --> 01:45:16.768
"O beloved."

1831
01:45:16.851 --> 01:45:24.685
"O my sweetheart."

1832
01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:34.060
"O my darling. 
O my sweetheart."

1833
01:45:39.101 --> 01:45:41.060
I knew you would come.

1834
01:45:41.685 --> 01:45:42.685
Thank you.

1835
01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:44.560
You are welcome.

1836
01:45:49.601 --> 01:45:53.226
Ginni, your father told me
everything.


1837
01:45:53.851 --> 01:45:56.018
Everyone has a past...

1838
01:45:57.101 --> 01:45:59.018
which is very difficult to forget.

1839
01:45:59.893 --> 01:46:03.851
But you can't plan
the future with past baggage.


1840
01:46:04.935 --> 01:46:06.726
We have to leave it behind.

1841
01:46:09.018 --> 01:46:10.976
Look, Ginni. I am in no rush.

1842
01:46:11.268 --> 01:46:13.060
You can take as much
time as you want.


1843
01:46:22.476 --> 01:46:24.185
Okay.

1844
01:46:24.393 --> 01:46:28.476
I have got
a small but cute gift for you.


1845
01:46:32.893 --> 01:46:35.810
I hope it will give you
the reason to be happy.


1846
01:46:40.101 --> 01:46:42.226
Because someone told me...

1847
01:46:43.685 --> 01:46:46.435
that happiness is very
important in life.


1848
01:46:48.435 --> 01:46:50.060
How did you like the gift, Ginni?

1849
01:46:50.726 --> 01:46:53.643
Ginni.
Fine.


1850
01:46:54.768 --> 01:46:57.476
I have a request.

1851
01:46:59.143 --> 01:47:01.018
I hope you won't refuse.

1852
01:47:03.726 --> 01:47:07.226
Tomorrow I have to attend a
function, and I want you to join me.


1853
01:47:08.143 --> 01:47:10.476
We will spend some time together.

1854
01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:12.768
Sure. I will come with you.

1855
01:47:13.226 --> 01:47:16.643
Thank you for honouring my request.

1856
01:47:54.393 --> 01:47:57.226
Lehmber, I want to tell
you something.


1857
01:47:57.768 --> 01:47:59.601
A sheep had a calf.

1858
01:47:59.685 --> 01:48:02.726
That calf keep moaning.

1859
01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:04.310
The family didn't know what to do.

1860
01:48:04.685 --> 01:48:07.935
So they tied his mouth.

1861
01:48:08.018 --> 01:48:11.518
Grandmother, what is Kataru?
Kataru like your uncle.


1862
01:48:12.935 --> 01:48:15.226
Are you happy?
Very happy.


1863
01:48:15.310 --> 01:48:16.393
Come on.

1864
01:48:19.101 --> 01:48:22.310
We have come to your wedding,
and not to a funeral.


1865
01:48:22.393 --> 01:48:26.643
Let's dance, because you will
forget me after tomorrow.


1866
01:48:27.976 --> 01:48:30.893
Fatso, am I going in coma?
Should I make you dance?


1867
01:48:31.601 --> 01:48:33.226
Stand quietly.

1868
01:48:33.476 --> 01:48:36.226
I have a request.
Find a girl for me.


1869
01:48:36.810 --> 01:48:38.810
First you get married.
I will marry later.


1870
01:48:53.685 --> 01:48:56.393
Bro, you are very big hearted.

1871
01:48:56.643 --> 01:48:58.851
You invited
your girlfriend to your wedding.


1872
01:49:00.143 --> 01:49:06.768
"I want to befriend
you for a lifetime."


1873
01:49:06.851 --> 01:49:08.810
Ginni. Ginni, what happened?

1874
01:49:08.893 --> 01:49:12.226
"You are just mine."

1875
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:14.226
Are you all right?
Yes.


1876
01:49:16.226 --> 01:49:18.101
Bro, so strange!

1877
01:49:18.185 --> 01:49:19.685
Not just the girlfriend...

1878
01:49:19.768 --> 01:49:22.476
you have even invited her father.

1879
01:49:22.685 --> 01:49:25.601
Fatso, I didn't invite anyone.
I didn't know anything.


1880
01:49:26.435 --> 01:49:28.060
Did he come to eat food?

1881
01:49:29.018 --> 01:49:30.268
Hmm.

1882
01:49:32.101 --> 01:49:34.685
We are so happy to have you
all here with us today...


1883
01:49:34.768 --> 01:49:37.601
for the engagement ceremony
of my lovely brother...


1884
01:49:37.685 --> 01:49:40.185
Lehmber and Stella.

1885
01:49:40.643 --> 01:49:41.810
Thank you.
Wonderful.


1886
01:49:48.685 --> 01:49:51.768
Here, dear.
Make her wear the ring. Congrats.


1887
01:49:53.393 --> 01:49:56.935
They make a nice couple.
Yes, Stella is very lucky.


1888
01:49:59.476 --> 01:50:01.101
Look. They both are
looking so happy.


1889
01:50:01.185 --> 01:50:02.768
It is a great moment.

1890
01:50:02.851 --> 01:50:05.935
This moment comes once
in a lifetime.


1891
01:50:47.851 --> 01:50:50.560
What did you do?
- The same thing which I should have done.


1892
01:50:50.601 --> 01:50:53.351
You love me
and you are marrying someone else.


1893
01:50:53.726 --> 01:50:55.643
Are you not tired of lying?

1894
01:50:55.726 --> 01:50:58.060
You are lying to her also.

1895
01:50:58.226 --> 01:51:01.310
Lehmber, how long can you
run away from the truth?


1896
01:51:01.393 --> 01:51:03.601
I am not running away
from the truth.


1897
01:51:03.726 --> 01:51:05.643
I am on the side of the truth.

1898
01:51:05.893 --> 01:51:07.476
But the truth didn't support me.

1899
01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:10.476
As long as I kept lying,
the whole world was with me.


1900
01:51:11.101 --> 01:51:12.726
The moment
I tried to say the truth...


1901
01:51:13.101 --> 01:51:14.851
even my shadow abandoned me.

1902
01:51:16.393 --> 01:51:17.893
I am your shadow.

1903
01:51:18.685 --> 01:51:22.685
When the sun is over the head,
we don't see the shadow.


1904
01:51:23.226 --> 01:51:25.185
But it never leaves you.

1905
01:51:25.601 --> 01:51:28.560
Thank you so much,
Ginni, for forgiving me.


1906
01:51:29.143 --> 01:51:31.143
And for coming back into my life.

1907
01:51:31.351 --> 01:51:32.560
Always.

1908
01:51:36.143 --> 01:51:38.018
Congratulations to both of you.

1909
01:51:41.893 --> 01:51:43.310
Did you think...

1910
01:51:43.393 --> 01:51:45.476
only you can lie.

1911
01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:47.560
We are also like you.

1912
01:51:47.893 --> 01:51:51.393
Dear, the world teaches us
to lie a little.


1913
01:51:51.643 --> 01:51:52.935
As for me.

1914
01:51:53.018 --> 01:51:55.768
I had made up my mind...

1915
01:51:55.935 --> 01:51:58.268
the day I saw you working hard.

1916
01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:01.601
Lehmber, when you refused
to marry me...


1917
01:52:01.685 --> 01:52:04.226
I realised you are a honest man.

1918
01:52:04.393 --> 01:52:06.976
And I thought of helping you.

1919
01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:09.935
Ginni's anger was justified.

1920
01:52:10.143 --> 01:52:12.601
We would have appeased,
but Lehmber...


1921
01:52:13.143 --> 01:52:15.851
it was important to
teach you a lesson.


1922
01:52:15.935 --> 01:52:18.226
We didn't take any loan from Stella.

1923
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:21.143
It was all a lie.

1924
01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:24.268
And I am here because of your words.

1925
01:52:24.518 --> 01:52:26.226
I had to help you with your love.

1926
01:52:27.851 --> 01:52:30.143
So you all took the refuge of lies.

1927
01:52:31.393 --> 01:52:34.435
Truth and lie are important
part of our lives.


1928
01:52:34.768 --> 01:52:36.226
We should never lie.

1929
01:52:36.393 --> 01:52:39.560
Because you hurt someone by lying.

1930
01:52:39.685 --> 01:52:42.601
You can spend your life by lying.

1931
01:52:42.893 --> 01:52:45.435
But by telling the truth,
you can live your life.


1932
01:52:46.018 --> 01:52:48.560
And I am thankful to all of you.

1933
01:52:49.018 --> 01:52:51.435
I am grateful as all of you...

1934
01:52:51.810 --> 01:52:53.643
showed me the real path of life.

1935
01:52:54.101 --> 01:52:57.143
And as long as I am here...

1936
01:52:57.393 --> 01:52:59.476
I will always tread
the path of truth.


1937
01:52:59.685 --> 01:53:00.976
I will never lie.

1938
01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:03.476
I will never hurt anyone.

1939
01:53:05.435 --> 01:53:06.643
Wonderful.

1940
01:53:09.143 --> 01:53:12.018
Bro, you were offering me your coat.

1941
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:14.268
So ask me again.

1942
01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:15.893
Can I take your coat?

1943
01:53:15.976 --> 01:53:17.810
I will buy a new one for you.

1944
01:53:19.143 --> 01:53:21.310
I don't want you to get stuck.

1945
01:53:26.685 --> 01:53:28.435
I too have said one lie.

1946
01:53:28.518 --> 01:53:31.560
What?
- If I tell you, we will get caught.


1947
01:53:32.268 --> 01:53:33.893
Lehmber, run!

1948
01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:59.226
"Desi groom. Desi groom!"

1949
01:53:59.310 --> 01:54:03.101
"You speak sweeter than honey."

1950
01:54:03.185 --> 01:54:06.810
"Your disco is priceless."

1951
01:54:06.851 --> 01:54:10.643
"The singles ask each other,
stealthily."


1952
01:54:10.726 --> 01:54:14.476
"From which village have you come?"

1953
01:54:14.518 --> 01:54:18.226
"From where did you
buy the golden shirt?"


1954
01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:26.310
"My eyes are on you."

1955
01:54:35.018 --> 01:54:43.018
"When she walks alone,
our hearts skip a beat."


1956
01:54:43.101 --> 01:54:50.560
"When she walks alone,
our hearts skip a beat."


1957
01:54:50.643 --> 01:54:54.726
"You have applied kohl in her eyes."

1958
01:54:54.810 --> 01:54:58.560
"From which village have you come?"

1959
01:54:58.643 --> 01:55:02.310
"From where did you
buy the golden shirt?"


1960
01:55:02.351 --> 01:55:10.351
"My eyes are on you."

1961
01:55:22.893 --> 01:55:26.560
"The moon descended
on the earth from the sky."


1962
01:55:26.601 --> 01:55:30.810
"Looking for it, in the clouds,
the stars have started a fight."


1963
01:55:30.893 --> 01:55:34.310
"The moon descended
on the earth from the sky."


1964
01:55:34.393 --> 01:55:38.060
"Looking for it, in the clouds,
the stars have started a fight."


1965
01:55:38.143 --> 01:55:42.351
"I have found my peacock."

1966
01:55:42.435 --> 01:55:46.018
"From which village have you come?"

1967
01:55:46.101 --> 01:55:50.060
"From where did you
buy the golden shirt?"


1968
01:55:50.143 --> 01:55:56.435
"My eyes are on you."
