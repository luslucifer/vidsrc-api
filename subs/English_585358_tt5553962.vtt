1
00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:52.339
As I was saying, it's about
a thousand square meters,


2
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.646
really spacious.

3
00:02:54.647 --> 00:02:57.345
Your daughter will have
plenty of room to run around,


4
00:03:04.135 --> 00:03:05.875
I have a daughter, too.

5
00:03:05.876 --> 00:03:09.052
You'll see how lucky you are
to have such a big yard too.


6
00:03:09.053 --> 00:03:10.227
It was beautiful once.

7
00:03:10.228 --> 00:03:11.968
There were lots of flowers here,

8
00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.405
some lawn furniture also,

9
00:03:14.406 --> 00:03:17.278
but they took it all away
because the rain ruined it.


10
00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:23.849
Who lived here?

11
00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:28.549
The owner was an
old woman, Mrs. White.


12
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.639
She passed away two years ago.

13
00:03:31.858 --> 00:03:34.033
The children moved
away for work.


14
00:03:34.034 --> 00:03:36.035
They decided to rent it,

15
00:03:36.036 --> 00:03:38.343
and they'll probably
sell it in a few years.


16
00:03:53.314 --> 00:03:55.489
The decorations
aren't that great,


17
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.625
but it's a lot of
room for your budget.


18
00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:05.109
Let's go upstairs!

19
00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:19.688
The main bedroom is here.

20
00:04:26.173 --> 00:04:27.782
And there's a smaller bedroom.

21
00:04:27.783 --> 00:04:29.133
It's perfect for the kid.

22
00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.570
There is also an attic upstairs.

23
00:04:32.571 --> 00:04:36.967
You can use it as a storage
or as an office if you prefer.


24
00:04:41.536 --> 00:04:42.624
Come on.

25
00:04:44.061 --> 00:04:45.584
It's only temporary.

26
00:04:48.326 --> 00:04:50.981
You'll like it when it's all
fixed up and clean, I bet.


27
00:05:39.116 --> 00:05:40.334
What's wrong, Sophie?

28
00:05:45.426 --> 00:05:46.600
It's okay.

29
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:47.689
It won't hurt you.

30
00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:01.834
Come on, come with
me in the other room.


31
00:06:13.715 --> 00:06:14.802
I know what we'll do.

32
00:06:14.803 --> 00:06:16.848
Let's order a pizza.

33
00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:18.458
Now, what do you say?

34
00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:20.287
Do you like that idea?

35
00:06:33.257 --> 00:06:35.519
You want some water?

36
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:23.454
Is there something wrong?

37
00:08:25.238 --> 00:08:27.152
What did you find?

38
00:08:27.153 --> 00:08:28.153
What is it?

39
00:08:52.831 --> 00:08:55.225
September 10, 1989.

40
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.161
Let's see if it works.

41
00:09:29.737 --> 00:09:31.303
Hmm.

42
00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:33.088
The gears just must
a little rusted.


43
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:08.863
Sophie, time for bed.

44
00:10:15.609 --> 00:10:17.784
What are you gonna tell
Dr. Loris tomorrow?


45
00:10:17.785 --> 00:10:18.785
That you're tired?

46
00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:20.744
Time for bed!

47
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.060
Goodnight!

48
00:11:19.064 --> 00:11:21.719
Do you like these toys, Sophie?

49
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.504
Which is your favorite?

50
00:11:31.859 --> 00:11:32.947
Who are they?

51
00:11:42.261 --> 00:11:43.915
What are they doing?

52
00:12:02.934 --> 00:12:03.978
And who is it?

53
00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:34.443
Her parents death shocked her.

54
00:12:34.444 --> 00:12:37.010
You have to stay close
to her, Annabelle


55
00:12:37.011 --> 00:12:39.622
Sophie's going through
a delicate phase.


56
00:12:39.623 --> 00:12:42.059
I know there isn't a lot
of trust between you.


57
00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.104
The fact that Sophie
doesn't speak anymore


58
00:12:44.105 --> 00:12:46.019
certainly doesn't help,

59
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.632
but you have to try
and forge a connection.


60
00:12:50.155 --> 00:12:51.461
I'm trying.

61
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.247
It's just, it's like
there's a wall there.


62
00:12:56.248 --> 00:12:58.555
I hadn't seen my
sister in 10 years.


63
00:13:00.252 --> 00:13:03.123
The first time I even met
Sophie was in the court


64
00:13:03.124 --> 00:13:05.300
when they were giving
me the guardianship.


65
00:13:06.606 --> 00:13:09.216
I know, it's normal,
she feels abandoned.


66
00:13:09.217 --> 00:13:10.305
Everything's new.

67
00:13:11.306 --> 00:13:12.830
You have to insist,

68
00:13:14.092 --> 00:13:15.745
even if she seems like

69
00:13:15.746 --> 00:13:18.270
she has no interest
in knowing you at all.


70
00:13:19.706 --> 00:13:22.013
She needs you,
you're all she has.


71
00:14:30.385 --> 00:14:32.125
Hi!

72
00:14:32.126 --> 00:14:33.605
I'm Annabelle Spear.

73
00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:35.564
I called on Thursday about
restoring some books.


74
00:14:35.565 --> 00:14:36.521
They said to come by today.

75
00:14:36.522 --> 00:14:38.262
Oh, yes, I was expecting you.

76
00:14:38.263 --> 00:14:39.655
I'm Eva.

77
00:14:39.656 --> 00:14:41.048
Mrs. Brown told me
you were coming.


78
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.190
Let's go!

79
00:14:55.715 --> 00:14:57.455
There was a mouse, actually.

80
00:14:57.456 --> 00:14:59.762
More than one to
tell you the truth.


81
00:14:59.763 --> 00:15:01.851
The damn critters
chewed on some books.


82
00:15:01.852 --> 00:15:04.854
I hope that doesn't
gross you out.


83
00:15:04.855 --> 00:15:06.029
Chewed pages, no.

84
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.902
A mouse between the pages maybe.

85
00:15:09.903 --> 00:15:12.340
Don't worry, I'm
fighting back with poison.


86
00:15:18.346 --> 00:15:21.000
There are five of them in all.

87
00:15:21.001 --> 00:15:22.001
Perfect.

88
00:15:50.814 --> 00:15:52.598
You're bringing
that to school, too?


89
00:15:56.036 --> 00:15:57.036
You don't need it.

90
00:16:05.655 --> 00:16:07.917
Don't tear the flowers
up out of the garden.


91
00:16:07.918 --> 00:16:10.268
Why did you put them
on my bed this morning?


92
00:16:20.495 --> 00:16:21.540
So, who did?

93
00:17:26.823 --> 00:17:29.913
Sophie, don't run in the house!

94
00:17:41.402 --> 00:17:44.491
Sophie, I said don't
run in the house!


95
00:23:00.852 --> 00:23:04.768
I don't know if it's me
doing something wrong.


96
00:23:04.769 --> 00:23:05.899
Maybe it's something I'm doing

97
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.640
that's making her act like this.

98
00:23:07.641 --> 00:23:09.990
Sophie's behavior is normal.

99
00:23:09.991 --> 00:23:11.296
Creating an imaginary friend

100
00:23:11.297 --> 00:23:14.039
is a way for her to
feel less lonely.


101
00:23:17.825 --> 00:23:19.522
I don't know, Loris.

102
00:23:19.523 --> 00:23:20.958
For the last few days,

103
00:23:20.959 --> 00:23:22.526
I keep finding rose
petals on my pillow.


104
00:23:23.788 --> 00:23:25.789
Sophie says it wasn't her.

105
00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.400
She seems so convincing.

106
00:23:28.401 --> 00:23:31.577
I, I wouldn't want
her be creating


107
00:23:31.578 --> 00:23:34.145
some kind of split personality.

108
00:23:34.146 --> 00:23:35.799
That's what you call it, right?

109
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.235
No, I don't believe so.

110
00:23:37.236 --> 00:23:40.804
Listen, bring her by
my office tomorrow.


111
00:23:40.805 --> 00:23:43.111
It'll put your mind at ease.

112
00:23:43.112 --> 00:23:44.461
Alright, thanks.

113
00:25:10.155 --> 00:25:13.550
No, don't touch my carillon!

114
00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.515
Sophie, what are you doing?

115
00:25:23.516 --> 00:25:24.995
Stop it!

116
00:25:24.996 --> 00:25:26.823
Sophie, Sophie!

117
00:25:26.824 --> 00:25:29.217
Sophie, stop it!

118
00:25:29.218 --> 00:25:30.741
Sophie, stop it!

119
00:25:32.003 --> 00:25:34.265
Gosh, what are
you doing, Sophie?


120
00:25:34.266 --> 00:25:37.312
You don't ever hit
anyone, do you under...


121
00:25:37.313 --> 00:25:38.401
Sophie!

122
00:27:35.213 --> 00:27:36.301
Sophie?

123
00:28:15.253 --> 00:28:16.253
Sophie?

124
00:28:24.393 --> 00:28:27.960
10, nine, eight, seven,

125
00:28:27.961 --> 00:28:29.441
six, five, four,

126
00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:33.358
three, two, one, here I come!

127
00:28:54.814 --> 00:28:57.338
Sophie what are
you doing out here?


128
00:29:01.125 --> 00:29:02.300
Sophie, go to bed.

129
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.198
I'm going to show you a color

130
00:29:32.199 --> 00:29:34.244
and you tell me what
it makes you think of,


131
00:29:34.245 --> 00:29:35.464
whatever comes to mind.

132
00:29:40.033 --> 00:29:41.818
That carillon is really nice

133
00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:44.821
Can I look at it closer?

134
00:30:05.537 --> 00:30:06.582
Who'll get angry?

135
00:30:24.774 --> 00:30:26.862
Your imaginary friend?

136
00:30:39.528 --> 00:30:42.356
Tell me about her,
what's her name?


137
00:30:55.587 --> 00:30:57.370
What is it, Sophie?

138
00:30:57.371 --> 00:30:58.590
Is Lania here with us?

139
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.088
Is there some pet you have

140
00:31:19.089 --> 00:31:21.395
or maybe a friend
of hers named Lania?


141
00:31:23.615 --> 00:31:25.834
Not that I know of.

142
00:31:25.835 --> 00:31:27.487
Who's Lania?

143
00:31:27.488 --> 00:31:31.317
Sophie associates this name
with her imaginary friend.


144
00:31:31.318 --> 00:31:33.016
She's really convinced.

145
00:31:34.147 --> 00:31:37.933
She really fantasizes
seeing her.


146
00:31:37.934 --> 00:31:39.283
She talks to her.

147
00:31:40.589 --> 00:31:42.024
The other night, she
was out in the garden.


148
00:31:42.025 --> 00:31:44.156
I swear I heard her talking.

149
00:31:44.157 --> 00:31:45.376
That's great news.

150
00:31:46.551 --> 00:31:48.378
She's starting to speak again.

151
00:31:48.379 --> 00:31:49.815
That's always a good start.

152
00:31:50.947 --> 00:31:53.601
She went through
a horrible shock.


153
00:31:53.602 --> 00:31:57.779
Her not speaking, creating
an imaginary friends,


154
00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.998
it's just a phase,
she'll get over it.


155
00:31:59.999 --> 00:32:01.957
It's really nice of
you to reassure me.


156
00:32:01.958 --> 00:32:05.613
It's really tough, the house,

157
00:32:05.614 --> 00:32:07.223
and work,

158
00:32:07.224 --> 00:32:09.400
and Sophie is so

159
00:32:11.707 --> 00:32:12.708
unusual.

160
00:32:13.709 --> 00:32:16.319
Thank you.
Of course.


161
00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.452
Before, she almost
had me convinced.


162
00:32:20.019 --> 00:32:21.193
If you think it might help,

163
00:32:21.194 --> 00:32:23.501
I could come to the
house for her sessions.


164
00:32:25.459 --> 00:32:27.897
Maybe it would make her
feel more comfortable.


165
00:32:29.289 --> 00:32:30.289
Thanks!

166
00:32:32.771 --> 00:32:36.253
Five, four, three, two, one.

167
00:33:44.625 --> 00:33:46.017
I'm going to show you a color

168
00:33:46.018 --> 00:33:48.672
and you tell me what
it makes you think of.


169
00:33:48.673 --> 00:33:50.456
Your imaginary friend?

170
00:34:05.646 --> 00:34:06.735
Sophie?

171
00:34:43.423 --> 00:34:44.423
Sophie?

172
00:36:16.168 --> 00:36:17.168
Hey.

173
00:36:19.084 --> 00:36:21.652
Hey, I need to talk to you.

174
00:36:23.219 --> 00:36:24.307
Are you okay?

175
00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:27.570
Yeah.

176
00:36:40.192 --> 00:36:41.498
How did you fall?

177
00:36:43.761 --> 00:36:45.457
Uh, I don't remember.

178
00:36:45.458 --> 00:36:47.896
I just fell back and...

179
00:36:50.202 --> 00:36:52.160
I don't know you that well,

180
00:36:52.161 --> 00:36:54.903
but I know now that
you're a terrible liar.


181
00:37:14.835 --> 00:37:16.576
I saw something that scared me.

182
00:37:19.797 --> 00:37:20.797
Lania?

183
00:37:28.197 --> 00:37:29.894
Hold the ice there.

184
00:37:40.035 --> 00:37:42.645
Loris, I think it's time
I call social services


185
00:37:42.646 --> 00:37:44.126
and reconsider the guardianship.

186
00:37:45.779 --> 00:37:48.130
I'm afraid I have real problems.

187
00:37:49.827 --> 00:37:50.827
I'm not well

188
00:37:52.003 --> 00:37:56.659
and I'm afraid that if
things keep up like this,


189
00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:57.878
I'm gonna need therapy.

190
00:38:00.403 --> 00:38:03.927
It's just,

191
00:38:03.928 --> 00:38:06.712
it's the fantasy of a child,

192
00:38:06.713 --> 00:38:10.542
and me, she's rubbing off on me,

193
00:38:10.543 --> 00:38:12.415
and I am going crazy.

194
00:38:14.417 --> 00:38:15.417
No, Annabelle.

195
00:38:17.202 --> 00:38:18.594
I'm here because
I wanna show you


196
00:38:18.595 --> 00:38:20.814
the video of this
morning's sessions.


197
00:38:28.518 --> 00:38:29.649
Your imaginary friend?

198
00:38:46.057 --> 00:38:47.189
Oh, my God!

199
00:38:49.495 --> 00:38:51.280
Sophie and I were alone.

200
00:38:53.978 --> 00:38:55.152
What does she want with us?

201
00:38:55.153 --> 00:38:56.720
Why is she following Sophie?

202
00:38:58.287 --> 00:38:59.635
I don't know, Annabelle.

203
00:38:59.636 --> 00:39:02.987
Whatever it is, she's
connected to your niece.


204
00:39:07.252 --> 00:39:08.949
It was her in the attic.

205
00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:13.606
This makes me doubt
everything I thought was true.


206
00:39:16.087 --> 00:39:18.436
If I hadn't seen the video,

207
00:39:18.437 --> 00:39:19.960
I would have never believed you.

208
00:39:21.919 --> 00:39:22.919
It's the carillon!

209
00:39:23.921 --> 00:39:25.792
It all started
when she found it.


210
00:39:29.535 --> 00:39:32.016
It was buried in this
box in the garden.


211
00:39:38.588 --> 00:39:40.503
Can you come with
me to the library?


212
00:39:45.073 --> 00:39:47.639
In this book, there's a symbol

213
00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.729
identical to the one on the box.

214
00:39:54.299 --> 00:39:56.084
I wanna know who
checked the book out.


215
00:39:59.391 --> 00:40:01.610
What does it mean?

216
00:40:01.611 --> 00:40:02.915
Do you think
whoever had the book


217
00:40:02.916 --> 00:40:05.527
was the one to inscribe
that symbol on the box


218
00:40:05.528 --> 00:40:06.528
and bury it?

219
00:40:09.009 --> 00:40:10.880
I don't know it could be.

220
00:40:10.881 --> 00:40:13.013
It's the only thing
that makes any sense.


221
00:40:15.233 --> 00:40:17.627
Maybe, Eva the
librarian, can help us.


222
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.544
What year do the
lending files go back to?


223
00:40:23.415 --> 00:40:25.417
The library was opened in 1962.

224
00:40:34.861 --> 00:40:37.036
Eva, out of curiosity,

225
00:40:37.037 --> 00:40:39.735
could you let me know who
checked this book out last?


226
00:40:39.736 --> 00:40:41.824
Oh, Annabelle, I can't.

227
00:40:41.825 --> 00:40:43.695
Privacy, you know?

228
00:40:43.696 --> 00:40:45.568
I'm, I'm sorry.

229
00:40:51.487 --> 00:40:53.966
Why do you want to know?

230
00:40:53.967 --> 00:40:55.969
Just work reasons.

231
00:40:58.276 --> 00:40:59.799
You didn't get it from me.

232
00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:10.549
The last time the book
was taken out was in 1989,


233
00:41:12.508 --> 00:41:17.426
Margaret White, 34
Saint Louis Street.


234
00:41:21.821 --> 00:41:23.910
Okay, okay, thanks.

235
00:41:30.526 --> 00:41:32.571
Sophie, come on, let's go.

236
00:41:39.274 --> 00:41:40.666
Isn't that your house?

237
00:41:44.148 --> 00:41:47.890
So, the former tenant
buried it probably.


238
00:41:47.891 --> 00:41:50.284
Do you know where they live now?

239
00:41:50.285 --> 00:41:52.025
She died two years ago.

240
00:41:58.162 --> 00:42:00.295
I have got to know
what that symbol means.


241
00:42:05.604 --> 00:42:08.433
Annabelle, could
you come here, please?


242
00:42:12.132 --> 00:42:16.571
That book deals with
supernatural if I'm not mistaken.


243
00:42:16.572 --> 00:42:18.225
Yeah.

244
00:42:18.226 --> 00:42:20.792
I overheard your conversation.

245
00:42:20.793 --> 00:42:22.446
There is a woman.

246
00:42:22.447 --> 00:42:24.361
She comes very
often at the library


247
00:42:24.362 --> 00:42:27.538
and she takes out
book like that.


248
00:42:27.539 --> 00:42:29.758
She's a psychic or so she says,

249
00:42:29.759 --> 00:42:32.587
but in any case,

250
00:42:32.588 --> 00:42:34.894
she knows a lot
about supernatural.


251
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:37.288
She's really nice, too.

252
00:42:38.768 --> 00:42:40.030
Maybe she could help you.

253
00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:41.900
Yeah.

254
00:42:46.471 --> 00:42:48.777
Eva can I just ask
you one more favor?


255
00:42:48.778 --> 00:42:50.257
Sure.

256
00:42:50.258 --> 00:42:51.562
When I go to talk to this woman,

257
00:42:51.563 --> 00:42:52.694
can I leave Sophie
here with you?


258
00:42:52.695 --> 00:42:54.174
Oh, yeah.

259
00:42:57.874 --> 00:43:00.615
This is her address.

260
00:43:00.616 --> 00:43:01.617
Thank you.

261
00:43:14.673 --> 00:43:16.152
Hi!

262
00:43:16.153 --> 00:43:17.545
Hi, I'm Annabelle Spear,

263
00:43:17.546 --> 00:43:19.329
and we're looking
for Mrs. Nills.


264
00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:20.722
It's late.

265
00:43:20.723 --> 00:43:22.767
She's not seeing
anyone else today.


266
00:43:22.768 --> 00:43:24.334
I'm sorry for bothering you.

267
00:43:24.335 --> 00:43:26.684
Eva the librarian, said
that she could help me.


268
00:43:26.685 --> 00:43:29.948
I'm trying to find the
meaning of a symbol.


269
00:43:29.949 --> 00:43:31.342
Please, I'm desperate.

270
00:43:32.735 --> 00:43:34.518
One can plead with
the saints for mercy,


271
00:43:34.519 --> 00:43:37.260
but Morris, my
assistant, is no saint,


272
00:43:37.261 --> 00:43:38.827
or am I missing something?

273
00:43:38.828 --> 00:43:42.047
These people
were hoping to see you.


274
00:43:42.048 --> 00:43:45.224
I need to speak with you
just for a few minutes.


275
00:43:45.225 --> 00:43:47.271
Here at the door or inside?

276
00:44:15.995 --> 00:44:17.780
It's written in Latin.

277
00:44:19.303 --> 00:44:21.609
If you're here to ask my help,

278
00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:23.786
I imagine you believe
in the supernatural.


279
00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:28.485
Mrs. Nills, I saw the
symbol printed on this book


280
00:44:28.486 --> 00:44:30.619
carved on a box
that my niece found.


281
00:44:31.968 --> 00:44:33.404
May I ask where you found it?

282
00:44:34.797 --> 00:44:36.929
It was buried in the garden.

283
00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.672
If I were you,

284
00:44:41.673 --> 00:44:43.587
I would put it right
back where it was buried.


285
00:44:43.588 --> 00:44:45.328
It's a warning.

286
00:44:45.329 --> 00:44:47.765
This symbol means
it's possessed.


287
00:44:47.766 --> 00:44:48.811
I'll explain better.

288
00:44:50.465 --> 00:44:54.250
Sometimes, tormented souls
attach themselves to an object


289
00:44:54.251 --> 00:44:56.687
and are unable to let it go.

290
00:44:56.688 --> 00:44:59.168
Sort of like there
are haunted places,


291
00:44:59.169 --> 00:45:01.040
there are also haunted objects.

292
00:45:03.173 --> 00:45:04.913
The more time spent
with an object,


293
00:45:04.914 --> 00:45:06.305
the more its owner
connects with it,


294
00:45:06.306 --> 00:45:09.397
until they finally,
can't be without it.


295
00:45:10.702 --> 00:45:12.573
The tormented soul
can also affect


296
00:45:12.574 --> 00:45:14.401
the personality of the owner,

297
00:45:14.402 --> 00:45:16.794
making them absorb their
positive or negative energy,


298
00:45:16.795 --> 00:45:18.840
whatever the case may be.

299
00:45:18.841 --> 00:45:22.932
Well, positive or
negative in what sense?


300
00:45:24.281 --> 00:45:26.892
A possessed object
can be good luck


301
00:45:28.807 --> 00:45:31.462
if the spirit connected to
it experienced immense joy,


302
00:45:33.072 --> 00:45:34.856
while it can cause misery

303
00:45:34.857 --> 00:45:37.729
if the object was connected
with a tragic or sad event.


304
00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:43.343
So, if I understand
you correctly,


305
00:45:45.476 --> 00:45:47.129
the spirit makes a
strong connection


306
00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:50.001
with whoever comes to
possess the haunted object.


307
00:45:50.002 --> 00:45:51.002
Right?

308
00:45:52.178 --> 00:45:55.050
No, it's much worse.

309
00:45:55.051 --> 00:45:56.313
It conditions their life.

310
00:46:00.012 --> 00:46:01.231
Did you open the box?

311
00:46:04.539 --> 00:46:05.277
Yes.

312
00:46:05.278 --> 00:46:06.278
And, what was in it?

313
00:46:32.175 --> 00:46:34.569
Sophie, be careful!

314
00:46:36.135 --> 00:46:38.529
Don't wander around
the bookshelves.


315
00:46:58.070 --> 00:46:59.070
Sophie?

316
00:47:00.203 --> 00:47:01.203
Sophie?

317
00:49:42.017 --> 00:49:42.973
I'm sorry I'm late.

318
00:49:42.974 --> 00:49:45.933
That's okay, she's sleeping.

319
00:49:45.934 --> 00:49:48.022
I hope it wasn't too
much trouble for you


320
00:49:48.023 --> 00:49:49.589
No, not at all.

321
00:49:50.503 --> 00:49:52.941
Did you find Mrs. Nills?
Yes.


322
00:49:56.118 --> 00:49:57.118
Oh, sorry.

323
00:50:01.601 --> 00:50:02.601
Hello?

324
00:50:30.369 --> 00:50:33.589
Thank you so much
for everything,


325
00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:37.333
for being here with Sophie
and I, I really appreciate it.


326
00:50:58.963 --> 00:50:59.963
I'm sorry.

327
00:51:01.009 --> 00:51:02.009
It's not you.

328
00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.797
I'll call you tomorrow
to check on Sophie.


329
00:51:45.618 --> 00:51:46.663
Is somebody there?

330
00:51:52.277 --> 00:51:53.670
Dumb mice.

331
00:52:51.815 --> 00:52:54.687
No!

332
00:53:02.043 --> 00:53:03.043
Sophie.

333
00:53:05.263 --> 00:53:06.612
Sophie, calm down!

334
00:53:09.746 --> 00:53:12.095
Don't ever do that
again, do you understand?


335
00:53:12.096 --> 00:53:13.618
You're not my mother!

336
00:53:20.061 --> 00:53:21.061
Sophie!

337
00:53:46.087 --> 00:53:47.914
Hi, have you seen a little girl?

338
00:53:47.915 --> 00:53:49.219
She's over there.

339
00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:50.307
Okay.

340
00:53:50.308 --> 00:53:52.962
Okay.

341
00:53:52.963 --> 00:53:54.268
Is Eva off today?

342
00:53:54.269 --> 00:53:55.486
She's in the hospital.

343
00:53:55.487 --> 00:53:56.793
We found her unconscious.

344
00:53:59.274 --> 00:54:00.623
Oh my God, that's awful.

345
00:54:11.199 --> 00:54:12.591
Everything all right at school?

346
00:54:23.733 --> 00:54:25.690
Sophie, can I see your carillon?

347
00:54:25.691 --> 00:54:26.779
No.

348
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:32.175
What if I just
take it for tonight,


349
00:54:32.176 --> 00:54:34.047
and I give it back tomorrow?

350
00:54:34.048 --> 00:54:35.048
No.

351
00:54:38.269 --> 00:54:40.140
Sophie, give me the carillon.

352
00:54:41.359 --> 00:54:46.538
Sophie!

353
00:55:07.472 --> 00:55:09.735
Sophie, don't worry, sweetie.

354
00:55:12.303 --> 00:55:13.303
It's okay.

355
00:55:16.742 --> 00:55:17.961
Lania is mean.

356
00:55:20.094 --> 00:55:22.096
She can't be mean if
we bury the carillon.


357
00:55:28.015 --> 00:55:30.842
Don't go away, you too.

358
00:55:30.843 --> 00:55:32.496
What are you talking about?

359
00:55:32.497 --> 00:55:34.542
I'll never go away,

360
00:55:34.543 --> 00:55:37.589
but honey, we have
to bury the carillon.


361
00:55:38.808 --> 00:55:40.114
Okay, tomorrow?

362
00:55:43.943 --> 00:55:44.943
Tomorrow.

363
00:57:48.938 --> 00:57:51.026
Did you bury it?

364
00:57:51.027 --> 00:57:53.638
Yes, sweetheart
the carillon is gone.


365
00:59:51.408 --> 00:59:54.062
I buried the box
but it didn't work,


366
00:59:54.063 --> 00:59:55.282
Then all this happened.

367
01:00:15.214 --> 01:00:17.520
So, you say it's the
spirit of a little girl?


368
01:00:17.521 --> 01:00:19.610
Yes, Lania, that's her name.

369
01:00:21.308 --> 01:00:23.744
At least that's what
Sophie calls her.


370
01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:26.964
And, your niece sees her
all the time and talks to her?


371
01:00:26.965 --> 01:00:31.186
Yes, she dug up
the box by herself,


372
01:00:31.187 --> 01:00:32.188
maybe that's why.

373
01:00:33.842 --> 01:00:34.843
May I see the box?

374
01:00:46.898 --> 01:00:48.813
Do you know who lived
here before you?


375
01:00:50.424 --> 01:00:53.992
Yes, of course Mrs. White,
but I didn't know her.


376
01:00:55.603 --> 01:00:57.605
So, you don't know what
she did in this house?


377
01:01:02.218 --> 01:01:03.524
She was a psychic herself.

378
01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:05.874
In those days,

379
01:01:07.745 --> 01:01:09.356
I mean when I was just a girl,

380
01:01:10.705 --> 01:01:12.881
people believed much
more in these things.


381
01:01:14.186 --> 01:01:16.927
They would come from
town to ask for her help.


382
01:01:16.928 --> 01:01:18.408
She had this kind of gift.

383
01:01:20.105 --> 01:01:21.977
She could speak to spirits.

384
01:01:25.894 --> 01:01:27.374
This is the symbol.

385
01:01:29.201 --> 01:01:30.680
The carillon is inside,

386
01:01:30.681 --> 01:01:31.987
correct?
Yes.


387
01:01:37.862 --> 01:01:39.124
It was locked inside here.

388
01:01:40.996 --> 01:01:42.824
This is certainly
not a good spirit.


389
01:02:22.516 --> 01:02:23.516
Morris?

390
01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:44.538
May I?

391
01:02:45.756 --> 01:02:46.756
Yes.

392
01:03:04.383 --> 01:03:07.081
Mrs. White knew the
world of the afterlife


393
01:03:07.082 --> 01:03:08.387
very intimately.

394
01:03:10.172 --> 01:03:12.740
She knew how to defend
herself from evil.


395
01:03:14.568 --> 01:03:16.091
This is a protective symbol.

396
01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:22.227
The spirit of this child has
been, let's say, weakened,


397
01:03:23.838 --> 01:03:26.317
because this house is protected.

398
01:03:26.318 --> 01:03:28.972
This is the safest
room in the house.


399
01:03:28.973 --> 01:03:30.497
Mrs. White probably worked here,

400
01:03:32.368 --> 01:03:35.718
however this protection
won't last forever.


401
01:03:35.719 --> 01:03:37.807
Generally, in cases
such as these,


402
01:03:37.808 --> 01:03:39.114
the more time passes,

403
01:03:40.507 --> 01:03:42.333
the more the person
that has the object


404
01:03:42.334 --> 01:03:45.467
becomes attached to
that possessed object.


405
01:03:45.468 --> 01:03:47.208
Simply put,

406
01:03:47.209 --> 01:03:50.385
the more time your niece
spends with the carillon,


407
01:03:50.386 --> 01:03:52.430
the more powerful
the spirit becomes,


408
01:03:52.431 --> 01:03:54.781
regardless of where it is,

409
01:03:54.782 --> 01:03:57.393
because, in a certain
sense, they become one.


410
01:04:00.178 --> 01:04:03.007
We, we did didn't do anything
when we buried it again.


411
01:04:05.227 --> 01:04:07.054
What do we do?

412
01:04:07.055 --> 01:04:08.404
I'm sorry, I don't know.

413
01:04:14.671 --> 01:04:17.238
Let's ask Mrs. 
White for help.

414
01:04:17.239 --> 01:04:18.239
Morris?

415
01:04:42.177 --> 01:04:45.789
Mrs. White, you
lived in this house.


416
01:04:48.096 --> 01:04:49.532
I need to speak with you.

417
01:04:51.969 --> 01:04:55.843
If your spirit is with
us, please give me a sign.


418
01:05:04.068 --> 01:05:08.637
Mrs. White, if your
spirit is with us,


419
01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:10.205
please, give me a sign.

420
01:05:27.396 --> 01:05:30.398
Hopefully, we can try
again another day.


421
01:05:30.399 --> 01:05:32.531
Alright, thanks.

422
01:05:33.924 --> 01:05:37.361
Put everything back
exactly as it was.


423
01:05:37.362 --> 01:05:38.841
It's a child spirit.

424
01:05:38.842 --> 01:05:41.018
It must know that
you are in control.


425
01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:36.176
Third step.

426
01:08:19.524 --> 01:08:23.790
September 10,

427
01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:27.923
Mrs. Roseline Potter
asked for my help.


428
01:08:27.924 --> 01:08:31.100
A case of a possessed object,

429
01:08:31.101 --> 01:08:33.887
a carillon linked to the
spirit of a child named Lania.


430
01:08:35.497 --> 01:08:37.454
I shut the carillon in
a box and buried it,


431
01:08:37.455 --> 01:08:39.761
so that the spirit
connected to the object


432
01:08:39.762 --> 01:08:41.372
may rest in peace.

433
01:09:01.784 --> 01:09:02.784
Hello?

434
01:09:11.925 --> 01:09:14.274
She felt really sick
during the session.


435
01:09:14.275 --> 01:09:17.581
I figured it was better not to
wait, so I brought her here.


436
01:09:17.582 --> 01:09:18.887
How is she now?

437
01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:20.672
The doctor is
inside with her now.


438
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:39.343
How is she?
Are you her parents?


439
01:09:40.562 --> 01:09:42.824
No, I'm her aunt.

440
01:09:42.825 --> 01:09:44.782
She has got a really high fever.

441
01:09:44.783 --> 01:09:46.175
We're doing more tests

442
01:09:46.176 --> 01:09:48.438
to try and understand
what the matter is.


443
01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:51.094
Medication doesn't seem to
have had an effect so far.


444
01:10:12.202 --> 01:10:14.551
The carillon.
No, sweetie.


445
01:10:14.552 --> 01:10:15.552
The carillon.

446
01:10:19.731 --> 01:10:21.820
I want to hear it, please.

447
01:10:46.193 --> 01:10:49.760
The doctor says that her
condition is back to normal.


448
01:10:49.761 --> 01:10:51.459
Tests show everything is fine.

449
01:10:53.156 --> 01:10:54.940
They'll keep an
eye on her tonight


450
01:10:54.941 --> 01:10:56.551
and release her
tomorrow morning.


451
01:10:59.467 --> 01:11:00.467
Thanks.

452
01:11:05.908 --> 01:11:07.909
Hey, come on.

453
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:09.955
The doctor says she's fine.

454
01:11:09.956 --> 01:11:10.956
Don't worry.

455
01:11:13.568 --> 01:11:16.048
I saw that Sophie is
starting to speak again.


456
01:11:16.049 --> 01:11:18.050
Yeah, and the first
thing she said to me


457
01:11:18.051 --> 01:11:19.748
is that I'm not her mother.

458
01:11:22.185 --> 01:11:23.925
Since Sophie has
come into my life,


459
01:11:23.926 --> 01:11:26.536
everything has
gotten so difficult.


460
01:11:26.537 --> 01:11:29.366
Don't say that,
everything will work out.


461
01:11:37.679 --> 01:11:39.028
See you tomorrow.

462
01:11:43.337 --> 01:11:45.382
If you need anything...

463
01:12:12.888 --> 01:12:13.714
What do you want to eat?

464
01:12:13.715 --> 01:12:14.716
Should we order a pizza?

465
01:13:30.792 --> 01:13:32.793
Okay, yeah.

466
01:13:32.794 --> 01:13:34.795
I just need you
for another hour.


467
01:13:34.796 --> 01:13:35.883
In the diary of Mrs. White,

468
01:13:35.884 --> 01:13:37.145
I found the person who asked her

469
01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:38.973
for help with the carillon.

470
01:13:38.974 --> 01:13:40.931
I wanna go talk to her.

471
01:13:40.932 --> 01:13:42.803
Sure, don't worry.

472
01:13:42.804 --> 01:13:44.327
Okay, thank you.

473
01:14:04.347 --> 01:14:06.261
Are you Mrs. Roseline Potter?

474
01:14:06.262 --> 01:14:08.481
Yes, who wants to know?

475
01:14:08.482 --> 01:14:10.874
Hello, I'm sorry,
you don't know me.


476
01:14:10.875 --> 01:14:13.181
My name is Annabelle Spear.

477
01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:14.704
I need your help.

478
01:14:14.705 --> 01:14:16.576
What's this about?

479
01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:19.492
I know that, years
ago, you had a carillon.


480
01:14:19.493 --> 01:14:20.754
Go away!

481
01:14:20.755 --> 01:14:22.756
No, no Mrs. Potter,
please, please!


482
01:14:22.757 --> 01:14:24.236
I need to talk to you.

483
01:14:24.237 --> 01:14:26.238
I know about your daughter Jade.

484
01:14:26.239 --> 01:14:29.502
Please, it's about my
niece, she's only six.


485
01:14:29.503 --> 01:14:30.503
Please.

486
01:14:33.376 --> 01:14:34.421
Come on.

487
01:14:39.774 --> 01:14:41.210
I didn't think to
contact a psychic


488
01:14:42.951 --> 01:14:45.388
until after the death
of my daughter, Jade.


489
01:14:46.781 --> 01:14:47.869
Mrs. White.

490
01:14:50.437 --> 01:14:54.397
Lania, after Jade was gone,

491
01:14:55.529 --> 01:14:57.226
manifested herself to me.

492
01:14:58.923 --> 01:15:00.620
She didn't try to hurt me.

493
01:15:00.621 --> 01:15:03.188
She was just there, next to me.

494
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:05.321
She was there always,

495
01:15:07.105 --> 01:15:09.325
until Mrs. White found
a way to free me.


496
01:15:11.458 --> 01:15:14.417
She put the carillon in
a box and she buried it.


497
01:15:19.292 --> 01:15:21.381
My niece found it
playing in the garden


498
01:15:24.035 --> 01:15:25.472
and since then, it's,

499
01:15:26.864 --> 01:15:28.257
it's been a nightmare.

500
01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:31.912
Do you know exactly
what Mrs. White did?


501
01:15:31.913 --> 01:15:34.436
I tried burying the box again.

502
01:15:34.437 --> 01:15:36.656
It didn't make any difference.

503
01:15:36.657 --> 01:15:38.702
I'm sorry, I don't know.

504
01:15:46.623 --> 01:15:50.191
Where did she get the carillon?

505
01:15:50.192 --> 01:15:52.412
She got it at an antiques fair.

506
01:15:54.109 --> 01:15:56.589
My daughter couldn't
be separated from it.


507
01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:58.809
She listened to it all the time.

508
01:16:01.377 --> 01:16:02.769
In the beginning,

509
01:16:02.770 --> 01:16:05.075
she said she was playing
with a little girl.


510
01:16:05.076 --> 01:16:07.339
I didn't believe her.

511
01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:09.342
I just thought she
wanted more attention.


512
01:16:11.909 --> 01:16:13.433
Then she started to get sick.

513
01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:17.697
She had this high
incurable fever.


514
01:16:17.698 --> 01:16:19.176
It would come and go.

515
01:16:19.177 --> 01:16:21.310
She'd seem to get better
and then she'd get worse.


516
01:16:24.966 --> 01:16:26.272
I'll never forget that night.

517
01:16:29.275 --> 01:16:32.842
I was, I was sitting
there reading


518
01:16:32.843 --> 01:16:37.456
and when I heard the carillon
play its entire melody,


519
01:16:37.457 --> 01:16:39.022
I had never heard the
whole thing through.


520
01:16:39.023 --> 01:16:40.460
It would always get stuck.

521
01:16:43.593 --> 01:16:45.681
I just felt something was wrong.

522
01:16:45.682 --> 01:16:48.903
I went to try and find Jade.

523
01:16:51.775 --> 01:16:53.168
I found her there on the sofa.

524
01:16:55.039 --> 01:16:56.779
She was dead.

525
01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:58.173
She'd been smothered.

526
01:17:00.871 --> 01:17:03.265
The carillon was
there next to her.


527
01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:08.749
If only I'd believed her.

528
01:17:13.101 --> 01:17:17.322
Do you wake up with rose
petals on your bed everyday?


529
01:17:17.323 --> 01:17:19.498
Lania did the same
thing with me.


530
01:17:19.499 --> 01:17:21.413
She gave me rose
petals every morning.


531
01:17:21.414 --> 01:17:22.980
She put them on my pillow.

532
01:17:24.852 --> 01:17:28.638
I think it was some sort
of attention, a gift.


533
01:17:31.641 --> 01:17:34.078
She wanted me as her mother.

534
01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:37.734
That's why she
killed my daughter.


535
01:17:40.084 --> 01:17:42.130
And now, she wants to
get rid of your niece.


536
01:17:47.527 --> 01:17:48.527
She wants me.

537
01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:55.230
The carillon has almost
played its whole tune.


538
01:17:56.666 --> 01:17:57.798
Then the time has come.

539
01:17:59.103 --> 01:18:00.103
Sophie!

540
01:18:11.377 --> 01:18:12.726
What's wrong, Sophie?

541
01:18:14.554 --> 01:18:16.512
Aunt Annabelle doesn't care.

542
01:18:25.478 --> 01:18:28.436
Come on, you know
that's not true.


543
01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:30.482
Don't ever think that.

544
01:19:24.188 --> 01:19:25.494
Is anybody there?

545
01:19:38.289 --> 01:19:40.117
I'm here.

546
01:19:58.832 --> 01:19:59.832
I'm here!

547
01:20:04.838 --> 01:20:05.838
Ha!

548
01:20:55.628 --> 01:20:56.628
Sophie!

549
01:20:58.456 --> 01:21:00.893
You didn't go away.

550
01:21:00.894 --> 01:21:03.765
I will never go away, okay?

551
01:21:03.766 --> 01:21:05.899
I will never go away, okay?

552
01:21:06.943 --> 01:21:08.205
Now, let's go!

553
01:21:48.506 --> 01:21:52.205
I heard the
carillon play its entire melody.


554
01:21:52.206 --> 01:21:53.685
I had never heard the
whole thing through.


555
01:21:53.686 --> 01:21:55.556
It would always get stuck.

556
01:21:55.557 --> 01:21:56.949
It didn't work

557
01:21:56.950 --> 01:22:00.866
because it didn't play
the whole melody yet.


558
01:22:00.867 --> 01:22:04.347
Sophie, you have
to listen to me,


559
01:22:04.348 --> 01:22:07.307
I have to bury the
carillon now, okay?


560
01:22:07.308 --> 01:22:08.874
You stay here.

561
01:22:08.875 --> 01:22:10.441
Don't leave this room, okay?

562
01:22:12.879 --> 01:22:14.836
Don't go!

563
01:22:14.837 --> 01:22:16.708
You have to trust me.

564
01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:18.579
Everything will be okay.

565
01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:20.974
Just stay here, okay, okay.

566
01:22:22.802 --> 01:22:23.802
Okay?

567
01:23:18.422 --> 01:23:20.468
Aunt Annabelle!

568
01:24:36.587 --> 01:24:37.675
Sophie!

569
01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:41.940
Sophie!

570
01:24:45.118 --> 01:24:46.553
Sophie.

571
01:24:46.554 --> 01:24:48.947
It's over, sweetie.

572
01:24:48.948 --> 01:24:50.035
It's all over.

573
01:24:50.036 --> 01:24:51.864
I'm here with you now.

574
01:24:57.043 --> 01:24:58.174
I love you.

575
01:24:59.349 --> 01:25:00.698
I love you too.

576
01:25:36.952 --> 01:25:37.952
Okay.
