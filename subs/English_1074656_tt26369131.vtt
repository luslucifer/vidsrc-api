[Enzo laughing]

158
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.000
Oh, this is a prank, right?

159
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.800
All those hidden cameras gonna pop out?

160
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.120
-Unfortunately not. Listen…
-[Marcin sighing]


161
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.600
Apparently, this all has to do
with some model, or teacher, or something.


162
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.120
Maybe some kind of affair.

163
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.680
But Alicja was the one who dumped me.

164
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.560
Hey. I wouldn't worry
about it all that much.


165
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.440
If you ask me, this isn't about jealousy

166
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.480
or wanting a different fit
for the company.


167
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.000
No. I think Alicja wants to destroy you
because it's fun for her.


168
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.720
It's a joke. But as they say…

169
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.440
no hard feelings.

170
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.840
So, your things please.

171
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.400
Or should I just call security?

172
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.000
[Enzo breathing deeply, sighing]

[Enzo groaning]

176
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.880
And the card.

177
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.880
-[funky music playing]
-Did she really fire me?


178
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.960
"Fired" is such a harsh and ugly word.

179
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.160
We'd prefer the expression "between jobs."

180
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.480
You know, just an impasse.

181
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.160
Um, It's best to think of it
as a, uh, new start.


182
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.800
Stefan.

[patting back]

184
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.000
[man] Well, Miss Grabarczyk,

185
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.800
I had a feeling this was going to be
an uphill battle after the summer.


186
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.080
I knew there was going
to be some pressure, some tension,


187
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.560
but seriously, already?

188
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.760
On the first day?

189
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.760
I totally understand, headmaster.
I'll do better.


190
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.040
Well, you really have to want this job.
You have to want to teach those children.


191
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.280
Your performance has been satisfactory,
but, honestly, that's not enough.


192
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.560
You will have to put in
a lot of extra work.


193
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.360
Also, couldn't you have picked up
the phone once when you were on vacation?


194
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.520
All these crazy journalists
kept harrassing the school.


195
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.160
Um, uh, I suppose
I could teach some extra classes, then.


196
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.680
-Free of charge.
-Oh!


197
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.680
Well, I guess it seems we have
an understanding with each other.


198
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.640
But please know
that this is your last chance.


199
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.040
I don't want to have
to deal with a celebrity.


200
00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.520
Is that understood?

201
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.960
-Is that understood?
-Yes it is, sir.


202
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:01.960
Excellent then.

203
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.000
My daughter has been completely
overlooked and neglected


204
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.000
in the school's administration process.

205
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.520
And, I mean,
despite being part of the list--


206
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.200
Excuse me, but what's going on?

207
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.080
I would like to make a public statement.

208
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.360
But not right here.

209
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.160
Could we move away
from the school's main entrance, please?

[camera shutters clicking]

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.800
[Monika] As for my statement…

217
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.560
See you!

218
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.800

I'd rather see my naked butt
on billboards than this, you know.


235
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.080
I've always said that the naked butt
has feelings, a mind, a heart and dreams.


236
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.840
And now people are finally realizing that.

I keep getting offers for Klaudia.

238
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.480
I mean, don't you think it'd be
a good idea to take advantage of that?


239
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.880
Why don't you just tell them
Klaudia's retired?


240
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.920
All right. How does this idea sound?

241
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.400
One last interview as her

242
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.840
so you can tell your side of the stories,
nip any rumors in the bud,


243
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.440
and Klaudia a proper send-off.

Funny we should bump into each other.

264
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.040
Um, I was just thinking about those shows
you offered me, and it turns out--


265
00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.440
No. That's not gonna work.

266
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.200
What do you mean it's not gonna work?
I'm moving on to a new chapter--

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.480
Well from what I heard,

268
00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.120
someone else started
that new chapter for you.


269
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.800
I'm not stupid enough
to stand up to Alicja.

In fact, no one is.

What are you talking about? Krzysztof!

and columnist. He wrote, "Inner Harmony."

-She is in a relationship with--
-Enzo.

I read your magazines.

283
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.400
And I'm a fan of your show.

284
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.320
[both chuckling]

285
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.760
Could you just this once
make an exception,


286
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.080
and, uh,
try and go somewhat easy on Monika?


287
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.520
What do you think, my sweet friend?

288
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.600
[both chuckling]

289
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.800
Enough. It's fine, thanks.

290
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.200
We're live in one minute.

291
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.280
[show theme music playing]

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.360
[audience cheering, applauding]

293
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.160
What we've got here, um,
is, uh, your newly-published book,


294
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.360
uh, "Inner Harmony."

295
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.480
I read it.

296
00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.120
-Nice.
-[Rafał] How long to write it?


297
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.720
To write about harmony
one must first find it within oneself,


298
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.720
that can take a while.

299
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.480
So ideal family, professional success.

300
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.840
Your life seems to be in total harmony.

301
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.520
Harmony is not always about
the external circumstances and factors.


302
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.120
You need to find that harmony
within yourself.


303
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.400
You need to first listen
to your inner voice.


304
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.560
Oh, that!

305
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.920
Yeah. So it was that inner voice

306
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.320
that told you to have an affair
with a 20-year-old secretary?


307
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.240
Great.

308
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.840
[audience jeering]

309
00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.320
So is cheating on your wife essential
to reaching a state of pure Zen?


310
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.440
Is that what you want us
to take away from your book?


311
00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.480
I don't have to listen
to all this nonsense.


312
00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.760
That's perfect.

313
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.800

1242
00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:35.800
I had to stop
after I had Damian, of course.


1243
00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:40.160
And years later I signed up to be a member
of the retro car club.


1244
00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:42.840
And why did you?

1245
00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.120
It felt like my life
was at a stopping point.


1246
00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.480
My son lives in the States.

1247
00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:50.360
He comes here every once in a while,

1248
00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.840
but mostly to try and convince me
to go live with him.


1249
00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.360
I'm on my own here.

1250
00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.920
I guess I just wanna feel
the excitement again.


1251
00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:05.040
Usually, club members
choose their own cars for the show.


1252
00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:08.880
It's not a real race, but I'd like
for my car to make it to the finish line.


1253
00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:13.320
Back then I was determined
to make this car win,


1254
00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:15.960
but everyone kept calling it
a pile of junk.


1255
00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:17.840
[Aleksandra sighing]

1256
00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:21.960
It wasn't your fault. 
You did a great job.

1257
00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:23.680
I'm the one to blame.

1258
00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:27.760
To this day,
the club still won't let me forget it.


1259
00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:30.080
Don't worry.
This time will be a different story.


1260
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.520
Do you think this time
me and the car will win?


1261
00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.800
I wouldn't go that far,
but you'll cross the finish line.


1262
00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:36.920
[both chuckling]

1263
00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.840
You really can be so terrible.

1264
00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.520
You know, I was thinking
maybe in a couple hours


1265
00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:47.960
you two would like to chat over dinner
at a nearby restaurant.


1266
00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:49.520
-[Bazyli groaning]
-I'd like that.


1267
00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:51.640
Wouldn't you?

1268
00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:52.720
Oh. [chuckling]

1269
00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:53.800
[Aleksandra] Hmm?

1270
00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:55.560
Could you do tomorrow at 9:00?

1271
00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.080
Yes.

1272
00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.040
Well, great. It's a date, then.

1273
00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.440
All right. I have to go.

1274
00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:03.600
Have a nice one.

1275

Yeah, I know.

1278
00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.920
I didn't forget
about the flashlight. [exclaiming]


1279
00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.280
What's going on here?

1280
00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:23.040
[woman] We're doing a first-aid course.

1281
00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:24.520
It's being graded?

1282
00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:26.080
-Yes, of course.
-[headmaster] Okay.


1283
00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:28.520
Kazik, where have you been?
I've been looking everywhere.


1284
00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:31.520
But Miss Monika wanted me
to help her out here.


1285
00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:32.960
But Miss Monika,

1286
00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:35.320
why are these students outside
during class?


1287
00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:37.040
Because it's fun.

1288
00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.560
"Because it's fun," huh?

1289
00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:40.480
Jeez, you never stop surprising me,
do you?


1290
00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:42.400
I'm taking Kazik. 
This is important.

1291
00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:43.400
Come on.

1292
00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:45.240
[kids clamoring]

1293
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.280
-[Monika] Come back when you're done!
-[Kazik] Mm-hmm.


1294
00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:54.000
Hello, and welcome everyone
to The New Life of Old Cars.


1295
00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:56.640
-That's a good name.
-Well, that's just a working title.


1296
00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:59.000
This blue beauty here
used to rule the road,


1297
00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:03.000
until it was destroyed in a race
and was transformed into a chicken coop.


1298
00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:06.800
But now, in the hands of our Maestro,

1299
00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:09.880
it's being rebuilt
with bigger and better parts,


1300
00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:13.360
and new pieces are being implemented
to completely eliminate rust.


1301
00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:14.600
You can't paint over the rust?

1302
00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:18.840
Actually, you can't just cover up the rust
with paint. No, no, no.


1303
00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:21.800
Anyways, once that's done,
you put everything back together,


1304
00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:24.520
order new windows, fill in the gaps,

1305
00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:28.520
paint it all, heat it directly
in the paint chamber and… good as new!


1306
00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:30.680
Uh, that's somewhat accurate.

1307
00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:32.360
What you see in front of you…

1308
00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:35.800
is a true work of art.

1309
00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:36.880
That should be good.

1310
00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:40.000
You know, I would actually watch
a show like that if it existed


1311
00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.480
and I owned a TV.

get a shot of our lovely Monika.

a good idea to focus more on the children?

and we're sticking to that script.

it's not about us.

some interviews with the contestants?

The children
would get a big kick out of it.

And that mathematics
won't win a talent show.
