It was bestowed upon

damn near crazy for

I just knew that it
was important for me


195
00:09:00.287 --> 00:09:02.189
that I express
myself through art.


196
00:09:02.189 --> 00:09:05.926
And I went to school during the
Reagan era and the explosion

of the crack epidemic.

198

Rap validated that
I wasn't insane.


199
00:09:09.163 --> 00:09:11.966
As a kid, I'm seeing
things that people


200
00:09:11.966 --> 00:09:13.434
aren't acknowledging.

201
00:09:13.434 --> 00:09:15.169
You know, Nancy Reagan
with that "just say no" shit,


202
00:09:15.169 --> 00:09:16.704
like, get the fuck
out of here.


203
00:09:16.704 --> 00:09:19.974
I know that my neighbor, who
used to have a great job,


204
00:09:19.974 --> 00:09:22.576
should not be standing
on a corner this year.


205
00:09:22.576 --> 00:09:24.445
So this is
beyond "just say no."


206
00:09:24.445 --> 00:09:26.180
This is an epidemic of sorts.

207
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.683
And rap is the only thing
that validated that.


208
00:09:29.683 --> 00:09:32.519
When Ice said, 6:00 in the

211
00:09:37.157 --> 00:09:39.693
didn't even have the chance
to grab my old-school tape.


212
00:09:39.693 --> 00:09:41.762
When I heard that
right now, I still


213
00:09:41.762 --> 00:09:44.531
get chills because
that's actually


214
00:09:44.531 --> 00:09:47.268
the life that I started to see

215
00:09:47.268 --> 00:09:49.903
Black teenage boys leading.

216
00:09:49.903 --> 00:09:54.675
And no one was acknowledging
that except for rappers.


217
00:09:54.675 --> 00:09:57.745
Can lyrics like that ever be
understood in the courtroom?


218
00:09:57.745 --> 00:09:59.480
They're not going
to say that the art


219
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.082
is simply a representation
of the imagination


220
00:10:02.082 --> 00:10:03.183
and the thought.

221
00:10:03.183 --> 00:10:04.518
They're going to say, it's you.

222
00:10:04.518 --> 00:10:06.720
You are a killer, Mike.

223
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.156
And we're going to
lock your ass up.


224
00:10:09.156 --> 00:10:10.691
It's a shame that
we live in a country


225
00:10:10.691 --> 00:10:12.960
where a white woman
who killed her husband


226
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.863
can write an article called
"How to Kill Your Husband."


227
00:10:15.863 --> 00:10:18.866
And that article is
not allowed to be used.


228
00:10:18.866 --> 00:10:21.669
And the prosecutor had to find
another way to convict her.


229
00:10:21.669 --> 00:10:24.305
But I could randomly say
some stupid shit in a song.


230
00:10:24.305 --> 00:10:26.907
And some prosecutor can
clumsily, with no rhythm,


231
00:10:26.907 --> 00:10:29.176
say that shit to a judge
as though he knows what


232
00:10:29.176 --> 00:10:32.313
the fuck I'm talking about,
has some type of expertise


233
00:10:32.313 --> 00:10:33.847
over the things
I'm talking about,


234
00:10:33.847 --> 00:10:35.983
or, somehow, what I'm
talking about is not art.


235
00:10:35.983 --> 00:10:39.920
What scares me, though, is
the criminalization of hip-hop


236
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.988

237

00:20:35.782 --> 00:20:37.684
♪ Innocent, I swear I'm
innocent for my own benefit ♪


462
00:20:37.684 --> 00:20:39.185
♪ It's mind control ♪

463
00:20:39.185 --> 00:20:41.221
♪ As soon as God forgive me,
I'ma sin again ♪


464
00:20:41.221 --> 00:20:42.822
Well, let's assume
a hypothetical.


465
00:20:42.822 --> 00:20:43.957
Okay?
- Okay.


466
00:20:43.957 --> 00:20:46.126
Let's say that
you're in the Bronx.


467
00:20:46.126 --> 00:20:48.828
And a couple subway
stops south of you,


468
00:20:48.828 --> 00:20:51.398
<i>there's a convenience-store
robbery and a homicide.</i>


469
00:20:51.398 --> 00:20:53.967
<i>Somebody dies
during this robbery.</i>


470
00:20:53.967 --> 00:20:55.869
And let's say
you're implicated.


471
00:20:55.869 --> 00:20:57.737
Somebody says that
they saw you there.


472
00:20:57.737 --> 00:20:59.472
So you're arrested.

473
00:20:59.472 --> 00:21:03.043
And you're charged with
being part of that murder.


474
00:21:03.043 --> 00:21:04.144
So I'm arrested.

475
00:21:04.144 --> 00:21:06.046
Then what?
What's next?


476
00:21:06.046 --> 00:21:08.581
So, while you're
in custody, police officers,


477
00:21:08.581 --> 00:21:10.884
the investigators, they're
going to go to your house.


478
00:21:10.884 --> 00:21:12.752
They're going to
find your computer.


479
00:21:12.752 --> 00:21:14.321
They have your phone already.

480
00:21:14.321 --> 00:21:16.222
They're going to comb
through your social media.


481
00:21:16.222 --> 00:21:19.893
They're going to find every
song, every lyric, every video


482
00:21:19.893 --> 00:21:21.494
that you've ever
been involved with.


483
00:21:21.494 --> 00:21:24.230
And they're going to use
that as evidence against you.


484
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:27.133
But I've never rapped about
robbing a convenience store.


485
00:21:27.133 --> 00:21:29.069
How could they even use it?

486
00:21:29.069 --> 00:21:31.838
They're going to take
every single lyric.


487
00:21:31.838 --> 00:21:33.606
And they're going
to rip it apart.


488
00:21:33.606 --> 00:21:35.442
If they can prove to
the jury that you're


489
00:21:35.442 --> 00:21:38.878
the kind of person, that you
have the kind of character


490
00:21:38.878 --> 00:21:40.780
to be involved in
something like this,


491
00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.650
then it makes it a lot easier
for the jury to vote guilty.


492
00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:48.455
Is innocent until proven
guilty a real thing?


493
00:21:48.455 --> 00:21:51.257
Clients will ask their
lawyer to get them


494
00:21:51.257 --> 00:21:53.526
the best deal possible,
even if they're innocent,


495
00:21:53.526 --> 00:21:58.131
because the idea of putting
your entire fate in the system


496
00:21:58.131 --> 00:21:59.833
is just too much
for people to bear.


497
00:21:59.833 --> 00:22:03.303
So, if there's a plea deal,
a lot of times people will say,


498
00:22:03.303 --> 00:22:06.006
I will sacrifice
two years of my life


499
00:22:06.006 --> 00:22:08.041
for something
that I had nothing to do with


500
00:22:08.041 --> 00:22:09.743
because I don't trust
the system


501
00:22:09.743 --> 00:22:11.077
to realize that it wasn't me.

502
00:22:11.077 --> 00:22:14.014
Only 1% of cases
actually go to trial.


503
00:22:14.014 --> 00:22:17.050
And when the trial starts,

504
00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.052
that's when the war begins.

505
00:22:19.052 --> 00:22:21.488
Is that what you want?

506
00:22:22.856 --> 00:22:25.225
<i>When you fighting
a system this big,</i>


507
00:22:25.225 --> 00:22:27.027
<i>is it even worth writing?</i>

508
00:22:30.597 --> 00:22:32.599
When we're talking
about any criminal case,


509
00:22:32.599 --> 00:22:34.434
we're talking
about the government,


510
00:22:34.434 --> 00:22:37.937
the power of the entire
government--its finances,


511
00:22:37.937 --> 00:22:41.541
its authority, its police--

512
00:22:41.541 --> 00:22:44.644
against a single person.

513
00:22:44.644 --> 00:22:47.680
<i>In law enforcement,
you have police,</i>


514
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.252
<i>who are trying to prevent
crime or arrest people for it.</i>


515
00:22:52.252 --> 00:22:55.955
<i>And then you have
prosecutors, DA, who are</i>


516
00:22:55.955 --> 00:22:57.590
<i>actually trying those cases.</i>

517
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:59.259
And the prosecutors
are only supposed


518
00:22:59.259 --> 00:23:03.396
to bring honest,
good-faith cases


519
00:23:03.396 --> 00:23:06.166
that they believe they can win

520
00:23:06.166 --> 00:23:08.635
at the standard
of beyond a reasonable doubt.


521
00:23:08.635 --> 00:23:12.105
A lot of mass incarceration,
racialized mass incarceration,


522
00:23:12.105 --> 00:23:13.940
what people call
the new Jim Crow,


523
00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.408
is a product of prosecutors.

524
00:23:15.408 --> 00:23:19.179
Prosecutors went from
prosecuting roughly one


525
00:23:19.179 --> 00:23:22.148
<i>out of three cases that
came into their offices</i>


526
00:23:22.148 --> 00:23:25.785
<i>as felonies in the
early '80s and the '70s,</i>


527
00:23:25.785 --> 00:23:27.554
<i>to two out of three.</i>

528
00:23:27.554 --> 00:23:29.756
<i>You just do the math on that,
and you have an explosion</i>


529
00:23:29.756 --> 00:23:31.825
<i>in the prison
population being driven</i>


530
00:23:31.825 --> 00:23:34.727
<i>by more punitive prosecutors.</i>

531
00:23:34.727 --> 00:23:38.465
There is no tool that they
will turn down


532
00:23:38.465 --> 00:23:40.733
if it will raise
their conviction rate.


533
00:23:40.733 --> 00:23:42.068
It's not about justice.

534
00:23:42.068 --> 00:23:43.603
We talk about the culture
of police.


535
00:23:43.603 --> 00:23:45.772
There's a culture in
prosecutors' offices, too.


536
00:23:45.772 --> 00:23:48.241
Most people in America
can't afford a private lawyer


537
00:23:48.241 --> 00:23:49.943
for a full criminal trial.

538
00:23:49.943 --> 00:23:53.379
So that immediately takes
something that is described as,


539
00:23:53.379 --> 00:23:55.348
you have all these rights, and
you get your Miranda rights,


540
00:23:55.348 --> 00:23:58.118
and you have a right to
a lawyer, that's all in theory.


541
00:23:58.118 --> 00:23:59.619
<i>You have the right
to remain silent.</i>


542
00:23:59.619 --> 00:24:02.021
<i>Anything you say
can and will be used</i>


543
00:24:02.021 --> 00:24:03.723
<i>against you in a court of law.</i>

544
00:24:03.723 --> 00:24:05.525
<i>You have the right
to an attorney.</i>


545
00:24:05.525 --> 00:24:07.427
<i>If you cannot
afford an attorney,</i>


546
00:24:07.427 --> 00:24:09.229
<i>one will be provided for you.</i>

547
00:24:09.229 --> 00:24:11.364
And in practice,
the lawyer you have a right to


548
00:24:11.364 --> 00:24:13.366
is probably going to
be a public defender.


549
00:24:13.366 --> 00:24:17.170
We don't resource them the
way we resource the police,


550
00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.139
the prosecutors, the bench.

551
00:24:19.139 --> 00:24:20.707
<i>And so you have
public defenders</i>


552
00:24:20.707 --> 00:24:23.943
<i>with 100 cases
on their docket.</i>


553
00:24:23.943 --> 00:24:27.647
What an artist is
walking into is essentially


554
00:24:27.647 --> 00:24:30.683
a prosecutor saying,
this artistic expression


555
00:24:30.683 --> 00:24:32.785
is actually some
form of a confession.


556
00:24:32.785 --> 00:24:36.256
<i>And there's nobody there
to provide the reality</i>


557
00:24:36.256 --> 00:24:38.391
<i>that that isn't what's
happening at all.</i>


558
00:24:38.391 --> 00:24:41.561
<i>So you've got a jury of

559
00:24:41.561 --> 00:24:44.864
many of whom are probably not
familiar with rap music.


560
00:24:44.864 --> 00:24:48.468
<i>Then a prosecutor
encourages jurors to read</i>


561
00:24:48.468 --> 00:24:50.670
<i>rap lyrics as autobiography.</i>

562
00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:53.673
That's very, very dangerous
because we know,


563
00:24:53.673 --> 00:24:56.409
you know, from all kinds
of empirical research


564
00:24:56.409 --> 00:24:58.711
that rap is really prejudicial.

565
00:24:58.711 --> 00:25:01.714
Rap is Black at its
core, at its roots,


566
00:25:01.714 --> 00:25:03.349
where it originated from.

567
00:25:03.349 --> 00:25:05.852
Prosecutors are not dumb.

568
00:25:05.852 --> 00:25:10.790
They see this, and they know,
okay, here is a way


569
00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:12.325
I can add a little something.

570
00:25:12.325 --> 00:25:14.194
There's the study out of the--

571
00:25:14.194 --> 00:25:17.297
I believe it's University
of California at Irvine.


572
00:25:17.297 --> 00:25:19.566
<i>[keys clacking]</i>

573
00:25:19.566 --> 00:25:23.269
My research examines the
consequences of stereotypes


574
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:24.637
about rap music.

575
00:25:24.637 --> 00:25:27.507
And to do so, I conducted
a set of studies


576
00:25:27.507 --> 00:25:30.443
where participants are asked
to read a set of lyrics


577
00:25:30.443 --> 00:25:32.845
<i>and then make judgments
about those lyrics</i>


578
00:25:32.845 --> 00:25:35.715
<i>or about the person
that wrote those lyrics.</i>


579
00:25:35.715 --> 00:25:39.185
I varied the genre
label of those lyrics.


580
00:25:39.185 --> 00:25:40.920
So participants either
learn that the music


581
00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.090
is, for example, rap...

582
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:47.460
<i>country, or heavy metal.</i>

583
00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.596
What they didn't know is
that everybody was reading


584
00:25:49.596 --> 00:25:51.531
the same lyrics from
a 1960s folk song


585
00:25:51.531 --> 00:25:53.233
called "Bad Man's Blunder."

586
00:25:53.233 --> 00:25:56.469
<i>- ♪ Well, early one morning,
I was rollin' around ♪</i>


587
00:25:56.469 --> 00:25:58.004
<i>♪ I was feeling
kind of thirsty ♪</i>


588
00:25:58.004 --> 00:25:59.305
<i>♪ So I headed for town... ♪</i>

589
00:25:59.305 --> 00:26:00.974
<i>- And so, after
reading those lyrics,</i>


590
00:26:00.974 --> 00:26:02.976
they were asked to evaluate
the lyrics across a number


591
00:26:02.976 --> 00:26:04.110
of dimensions, right?

592
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.145
<i>How offensive are the lyrics?</i>

593
00:26:06.145 --> 00:26:08.248
<i>How threatening
are the lyrics?</i>


594
00:26:08.248 --> 00:26:10.283
"Early one evening,
I was rolling around."


595
00:26:10.283 --> 00:26:11.884
"I was feeling kind of mean.

596
00:26:11.884 --> 00:26:13.419
I shot a deputy down."

597
00:26:13.419 --> 00:26:15.488
"Strollin' on home,
and I went to bed.


598
00:26:15.488 --> 00:26:17.890
Well, I laid me a pistol up
under my head."


599
00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:21.094
Most importantly, they
were asked, how literal


600
00:26:21.094 --> 00:26:22.829
<i>are these lyrics, right?</i>

601
00:26:22.829 --> 00:26:26.032
<i>Were these lyrics based off
of the songwriter's real life?</i>


602
00:26:26.032 --> 00:26:28.334
"The judge
was an old man, 93."


603
00:26:28.334 --> 00:26:29.902
- "93."
- "93.


604
00:26:29.902 --> 00:26:31.537
And I didn't like the way
the jury looked at me."


605
00:26:31.537 --> 00:26:33.373
"I think
they were suspicious.


606
00:26:33.373 --> 00:26:36.376
"The judge and the
jury, they did agree.


607
00:26:36.376 --> 00:26:38.611
They all said murder
in the first degree."


608
00:26:38.611 --> 00:26:40.213
<i>How likable is
the songwriter?</i>


609
00:26:40.213 --> 00:26:42.348
<i>How intelligent
is the songwriter?</i>


610
00:26:42.348 --> 00:26:46.152
<i>How aggressive is
the songwriter?</i>


611
00:26:46.152 --> 00:26:47.587
"You got
a point there, judge.


612
00:26:47.587 --> 00:26:49.589
It was a most

both:
"You're dead."


626
00:27:11.911 --> 00:27:15.415
People are a lot more aware

627
00:27:15.415 --> 00:27:17.350
that they shouldn't say

628
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:19.419
explicitly racist things, right?

629
00:27:19.419 --> 00:27:22.522
So if you say, hey, here's
a Black guy making music,


630
00:27:22.522 --> 00:27:23.856
there's a chance
that they're going


631
00:27:23.856 --> 00:27:25.458
<i>to say, no,
especially in a study,</i>


632
00:27:25.458 --> 00:27:26.592
<i>you're not going to trick me.</i>

633
00:27:26.592 --> 00:27:28.227
<i>I'm not going to
respond in a way</i>


634
00:27:28.227 --> 00:27:30.129
<i>where you think I'm racist.</i>

635
00:27:30.129 --> 00:27:34.667
But if you use rap as kind of
a cue, right, a cue to race,


636
00:27:34.667 --> 00:27:37.136
right, that's where
the mind goes.


637
00:27:37.136 --> 00:27:40.573
<i>It's kind of using rap
music to fill in the blanks.</i>


638
00:27:40.573 --> 00:27:42.141
<i>You know, okay, so I'm not
going to judge this person</i>


639
00:27:42.141 --> 00:27:44.877
<i>because of their race
but because of their music.</i>


640
00:27:44.877 --> 00:27:49.015
What we found in that study is
that the songwriter was viewed


641
00:27:49.015 --> 00:27:53.619
as having worse character and
a greater criminal propensity


642
00:27:53.619 --> 00:27:56.289
<i>if his lyrics were described
as rap music,</i>


643
00:27:56.289 --> 00:27:58.858
<i>compared to country
or heavy metal.</i>


644
00:27:58.858 --> 00:28:01.160
Because we're supposed to
always be so authentic


645
00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.330
or so real, I think, you know,
rap lyrics and hip-hop lyrics


646
00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:07.600
are definitely taken
more literally than most


647
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.502
other forms of music...

648
00:28:13.906 --> 00:28:16.376
<i>And not be held
to the same standards.</i>


649
00:28:26.819 --> 00:28:29.155
Because, obviously, the
environment we come from,


650
00:28:29.155 --> 00:28:31.324
and so many of us make the
claim that this is real,


651
00:28:31.324 --> 00:28:32.859
or we're real.

652
00:28:39.799 --> 00:28:42.335
<i>- Race is central to
rap lyrics on trial.</i>


653
00:28:42.335 --> 00:28:43.436
Juries will jump
to a conclusion


654
00:28:43.436 --> 00:28:46.439
that, hey, this
person's guilty.


655
00:28:46.439 --> 00:28:47.874
These rap lyrics,
if they're not


656
00:28:47.874 --> 00:28:49.275
confessional to
this crime, they're


657
00:28:49.275 --> 00:28:50.643
confessional to other crimes.

658
00:28:50.643 --> 00:28:52.845
So there's really
no harm in finding him guilty


659
00:28:52.845 --> 00:28:54.781
because he's
definitely guilty of something.

to say it,


661

it straight--it's racism.


662
00:28:59.452 --> 00:29:02.588
And prosecutors, they
have trainings on it.


663

It's a classic L.A. gang
story as old as time.

00:33:12.872 --> 00:33:15.741
Prosecutors are not
supposed to introduce


766
00:33:15.741 --> 00:33:17.643

767
00:33:17.643 --> 00:33:19.578
<i>Character evidence...</i>

<i>So, when they
introduce rap lyrics,</i>


771
00:33:28.854 --> 00:33:30.222
to avoid being seen

772
00:33:30.222 --> 00:33:32.091
as if they are introducing
character evidence,


773
00:33:32.091 --> 00:33:34.226
they have to
find other justifications


774
00:33:34.226 --> 00:33:35.594
for using the lyrics.

775
00:33:35.594 --> 00:33:38.564
In the Drakeo case,
they were using


776
00:33:38.564 --> 00:33:40.966
lyrics in a bizarre way.

777
00:33:40.966 --> 00:33:44.036
<i>There was a lyric he had
where he talks about,</i>


778

<i>I've got RJ tied
up in the back.</i>


779
00:33:46.105 --> 00:33:49.508
<i>And RJ refers to
a rival rapper.</i>


780
00:33:49.508 --> 00:33:53.879
That lyric was used in order
to demonstrate that Drakeo


781
00:33:53.879 --> 00:33:57.817
had animosity and
motive to orchestrate


782
00:33:57.817 --> 00:33:59.485
a hit on a rival rapper.

783
00:33:59.485 --> 00:34:01.253
Worth noting that
that rival rapper


784
00:34:01.253 --> 00:34:03.723
has said repeatedly that he
did not think that Drakeo


785
00:34:03.723 --> 00:34:05.024
was trying to kill him.

786
00:34:05.024 --> 00:34:06.826
They knew who
the murderer was.


787
00:34:06.826 --> 00:34:09.595
It was not a mystery.
They had jailhouse recordings.


788
00:34:09.595 --> 00:34:10.963
They had an informant.

789
00:34:10.963 --> 00:34:13.733
But they wanted Drakeo.
Drakeo was the big prize.

01:11:53.223 --> 01:11:54.257
at all.
- Wow.


1671
01:11:54.257 --> 01:11:56.660
Were you writing?
- Yeah, writing.


1672
01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:59.062
That's where I decided I want
to be a rapper, in jail, yeah.


1673
01:11:59.062 --> 01:12:00.597
And the girls on the
wing pushed me as well.


1674
01:12:00.597 --> 01:12:02.299
They used to tell me,
Lav, come and rap for us.


1675
01:12:02.299 --> 01:12:03.900
Come and sing for us
on the wing and stuff.


1676
01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:07.337
Like, yeah, they pushed me
to chase this dream, really.


1677
01:12:07.337 --> 01:12:09.539
They always told me,
you're bigger than this.


1678
01:12:09.539 --> 01:12:12.109
Have you heard about
what's happening now


1679
01:12:12.109 --> 01:12:15.512
where people are using
lyrics as evidence


1680
01:12:15.512 --> 01:12:17.214
against rappers in court?

1681
01:12:17.214 --> 01:12:18.782
Yeah. [chuckles]
That's happened to me.


1682
01:12:18.782 --> 01:12:20.183
- Has it?
- Yes.


1683
01:12:20.183 --> 01:12:21.952
Oh, please tell
me about that.


1684
01:12:21.952 --> 01:12:23.220
[chuckles]
Well, I released some music


1685
01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:24.654
after I'd come out of prison.

1686
01:12:24.654 --> 01:12:27.524
They're taking all of
my music, like, as evidence


1687
01:12:27.524 --> 01:12:29.026
for my deportation case.

1688
01:12:29.026 --> 01:12:30.961
They took one of
my songs on my--


1689
01:12:30.961 --> 01:12:33.096
the chorus is, gun on
my hip, gun in the crib,


1690
01:12:33.096 --> 01:12:35.065
gun in the ride--just lyrics.
[laughs]


1691
01:12:35.065 --> 01:12:37.801

out word for word--


1692
01:12:37.801 --> 01:12:40.103
gun on my hip, gun on my--
- No.


1693
01:12:40.103 --> 01:12:41.838
[laughs] I was trying
so hard not to laugh.


1694
01:12:41.838 --> 01:12:43.373
No way.

1695
01:12:43.373 --> 01:12:46.443
But I had to stop
making drill music.


1696
01:12:46.443 --> 01:12:48.045
Like, they told you
you can't make--


1697
01:12:48.045 --> 01:12:49.312
Yeah, well, I got a warning.

1698
01:12:49.312 --> 01:12:52.215
If I carry on "inciting"
gang violence...


1699
01:12:52.215 --> 01:12:55.085
And if they had it
their way, yeah,


1700
01:12:55.085 --> 01:12:56.720
I wouldn't still be doing this.

1701
01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.822

I can do to change my life.

even stop me doing that?
