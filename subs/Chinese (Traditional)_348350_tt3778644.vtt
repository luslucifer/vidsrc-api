滾到洞裡去
Get back in the den.


22

看我偷到什麼了
Look what I stole!


23
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.030
毗羲會給我一份額外口糧的
Proxima'll give me an extra portion for this!


24
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.990
不 我覺得她會把額外口糧給我的
Nope, I think she's gonna give that extra portion to me.


25
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.860
還給我
Hey, give it back!


26
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.030
在誰手裡就歸誰
It belongs to whoever's holding it!


27
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.960
不是你的了

31
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.970
什麼 給我看下
What? Let me see that!


32
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.090
不行 這是我的牌
Nope, it's my card.


33
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.140
你作弊
You cheat.


34
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.880
漢
Han!


35
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.550
你去了那麼長時間
You were gone too long!


36
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.060
我就知道肯定是出事了
I knew something must've gone wrong.


37
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.670
我沒事 倒楣的是他們
This is nothing. You should see them.


38
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.740
下來看看
Look down here!


39
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.180
聽我說
All right, listen.


40
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.550
在交易的過程中
I was in the middle of the exchange,


41
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.710
我正準備交出核芯素
I'm handing over the coaxium


42
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.550
他的手下襲擊了我 我耍了他們
and his goons jumped me, but I showed 'em.


43
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.190
你是怎麼辦到的
How?


44
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.360
我逃走了 然後偷了他們的飛車
I ran away, then I boosted their speeder.


45
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.420
我們是不是可以離開這裡了
What, are we going somewhere?


46
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.230
沒錯 想去哪就去哪
Yeah, anywhere we want.


47
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.740
你偷了一管這個
You held on to one of the vials?


48
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.920
漢回來了 快去
Han's back!


49
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.750
這 這管東西值...
This, this is worth...


50
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.740
值五六百個信用點
Five, six hundred credits.


51
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.940
我們現在不缺錢了
That's more than you said we'd need.


52
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.180
那我們可以用這筆錢離開控制區了
To buy our way out of the control zone.


53
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.610
離開克雷利亞星球
And off Corellia.


54
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.720
漢 我們能遠走高飛了...
Han, this could work.


55
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.840
肯定能遠走高飛的
This is gonna work.


56
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.410
琦拉 你經常說 總有一天我們要離開這裡
Qi'ra, you always said one day we're gonna get out of here.


57
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.750
這一天來了
This is it.


58
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.570
那我們還等什麼
What are we waiting for?


59
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.130
他們在那 嘿 你們倆
There he is. Hey, you two!


60
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.050
莫克洛 你好嗎
Moloch. Hi, how are ya?


61
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.330
我正準備去見毗羲夫人呢
I was just on my way to see Lady Proxima.


62
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.660
你還有錢還債嗎

63
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.410
我這一晚上經歷的事
What a night I had.


64
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.640
說出來你都不信 怎麼說呢 我是...
You're not gonna believe it. You'll believe it, but...


65
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.180
搜他的身

66
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.780
不許動 臭老鼠
Hold still, scrumrat!


67
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.390
輕點兒
Easy.


68
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.550
快走
Come on.


69
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.670
好的
All right.


70
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.930
我們去見毗羲夫人
Let's go see Lady Proxima.


71
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.520
說說吧 怎麼回事
Well, what happened?


72
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.860
我告訴您發生了什麼
I'll tell you what happened.


73
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.070
他們背叛了您 還想殺了我
They double-crossed you and tried to kill me.


74
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.900
那錢呢
The money?


75
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.720
- 他們搶了 - 那我的核芯素呢
- They kept it. - And my coaxium?


76
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.800
他們也搶走了
They kept that, too.


77
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.810
不過倒是給我們上了一課
But we learned a very valuable lesson.


78
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.450
我們不能相信那群傢伙
We cannot trust those guys.


79
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.310
所以你認為我們會相信你
So you expect me to believe


80
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.950
就看你這麼兩手空空的回來了
that you walked away with nothing!


81
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.240
我...帶著小命逃回來的 不算兩手空空吧
I ran away with my life. I think that's something.


82
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.440
我覺得我自己的命還是很重要的
To me, that's a lot.


83
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.740
我交給你這麼簡單的一個任務
I trusted you with a simple task,


84
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.520
你回來的時候卻是滿腹藉口
and all I'm hearing are excuses.


85
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.850
不聽話就得接受懲罰
There must be consequences for disobedience


86
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.710
不然你永遠都不長記性
or else you never learn.


87
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.840
我告訴你
You know what?


88
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.230
我就是永遠不長記性
I don't think I'm ever gonna learn.


89
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.900
你說什麼
What did you say?


90
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.320
我說 以後誰再敢打我
I said, next time somebody hits me,


91
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.760
我就打回去
I hit 'em back.


92
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.870
莫洛克 等等
Moloch, wait!


93
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.230
不要
Don't!


94
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.750
琦拉 你還記得那個地窖嗎
Qi'ra, remember the Silo?


95
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.620
我們把你解救出來
We pulled you out of that horror,


96
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.170
收留了你
gave you a home.


97
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.880
不要為了漢放棄這一切 他不值得你這樣
Don't throw it away for Han. He's not worth it!


98
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.370
他在交易中損失的那些 我們會雙倍賺回來
Whatever he lost on the deal, we'll earn it back, double.


99
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.700
我們會補償您的
We will make it up to you.


100
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.250
所有人都給我退後
Everybody, stand back!


101
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.030
那是個什麼玩意
What's that supposed to be?


102
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.720
這是一枚熱能榴彈
This is a thermal detonator


103
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.250
我剛拉下了保險
that I just armed.


104
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.950
- 那是一個石頭 - 不  不是
- That's a rock! - No, it's not.


105
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.820
就是石頭
Yes, it is!


106
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.720
那哢嚓聲
And you just made


107
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.480
是你用嘴發出來的
a clicking sound with your mouth.


108
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.240
別告訴我這就是你的計畫
Please tell me this isn't your plan.


109
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.620
不 這才是...
No, this is.


110
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.380
- 上車 - 一輛M-68麼
- Get in! - An M-68?


111
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.230
- 很不錯吧 - 我喜歡
- Nice, right? - I love it!


112
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.040
我們坐從寶冠航空港
There's a starliner leaving from Coronet Spaceport,


113
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.310
起飛的星際航班
we're gonna be on it.


114
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.990
我們買通檢查站的工作人員 然後就自由了
We bribe our way through the checkpoint, and we're free.


115
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.040
我要當飛行員
I'm gonna be a pilot.


116
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.510
我們可以買一艘屬於自己的飛船
We can get our own ship.


117
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.430
我要飛遍整個銀河系
See the galaxy, all of it.


118
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.240
以後我們再也不會受到任何人的擺佈和欺負了
We won't have to take orders or be kicked around by anyone.


119
00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.660
沒錯
Ever.


120
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.210
見鬼 他們這麼快就追上來了
Thought we'd get a little more of a head start.


121
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.360
坐好
- Whoa! - Hang on!


122
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.690
這裡屬於管制區域
This is a secure area.


123

規章制度
Protocol.


126
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.420
見鬼 那輛陸行艇好快
Damn! That stinger's fast.


127
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.890
是啊 我們更快 對吧
Yeah, but we're faster, right?


128
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.370
但願如此
I hope so.


129
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.850
靠邊停車
Pull over!


130
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.320
漢 我們過不去的
Han, no, we're not gonna make it!


131
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.100
是嗎
Oh, yeah?


132
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.870
漢 不行 路太窄了
Han, I'm telling you, it's too tight!


133
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:49.370
看我的
Watch this.


134
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.710
放出獵犬

135
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.750
追上他們

136
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.330
快
Come on!


137
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.630
我們得走了
We gotta move.


138
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.570
沒有登機牌的旅客
Do not join the line


139
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.370
不要排隊

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.340
快走 快走
Move along. Move along.


143
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.880
退後 不要抵抗
Stand down. Do not resist!


144
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.610
- 別掙扎了  - 你們放開我
- Stop struggling. - Let me go!


145
00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.570
抓住他的手
Take his arm.


146
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:51.340
我抓住他了
I got him.


147
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:53.510
押到3B牢房
Take him to cell 3B.


148
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.350
這邊 快走
This way, come on.


149
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.360
快走 抓緊了
Keep moving. Hold it, hold it.


150
00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:00.840
下一位
Next.


151
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.820
漢 他們來了
Han, they're here.


152
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.500
你們幹什麼的...
Hey, what are you...


153
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.560
我們快到了
We're almost there.


154
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.570
- 你跟緊我 - 下一位
- Just hold on to me. - Next.


155
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.640
不要回頭
Don't look back.


156
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.190
一旦通過了我們可得想好
Once we're through, we've gotta be smart,


157
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.700
接下來要去哪
figure out where we're going.


158
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.720
只要不是帝國的領域就行
Anywhere the Empire isn't. Wherever we go,


159
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.230
哪裡都不會比這差
it can't be worse than where we've been.


160
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.760
這可說不好 在那邊我們不受保護
Yes, it can. Out there, we've got no protection.


161
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.930
我們可能會被人販子抓住
We could get snatched up by traffickers,


162
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.500
賣給血紅黎明或者赫特人集團
sold to Crimson Dawn or the Hutt Cartel.


163
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.660
我絕對不會
That's not gonna happen.


164
00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:36.910
讓這種事情發生的
I won't let it.


165
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.250
護身符
For luck?


166
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:47.950

You heard him. Let's go.


168

169
00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.620
身份證件
ID chips.


170
00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.760
真不巧 我們忘帶了
Funny thing, we don't have 'em.


171
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.120
我們有這個
We have this.


172
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.640
精煉超空間燃料
Refined hyperfuel.


173
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.610
它至少值八百個信用點
It's worth at least 800 credits, maybe more.


174
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.270
持有這個東西是違法的
You could be detained just for having that.


175
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.110
你為什麼要這麼嚴肅呢
What good would that do anybody?


176
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.180
讓我們過去就是你的了
Let us through, it's all yours.


177
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.790
把核芯素交給我
The coaxium, now.


178
00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.410
讓我們通過就給你
As we're going through, not before.


179
00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:33.940

Do it.

全體注意 有人闖入
All units, there has been a breach.


196
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.240
還有一名非法旅客闖入了檢查站
Another unauthorized traveler made it through the gate.


197
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.740
有人闖過關卡 去那邊搜索
One got through the gate! Look over there!


198
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.910
有人闖過了檢查站
Someone got through the checkpoint.


199

This is where I sign up to be a pilot, right?


213
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.900
你可以申請加入帝國海軍
If you apply for the Imperial Navy,


214
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.740
大多數新兵會加入陸軍
but most recruits go into the infantry.


215
00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.890
我要當飛行員 成為銀河系最棒的飛行員

220
00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.950
那要看你能不能服從命令

你想飛到哪裡去呀

225
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.870

你的家人呢
Who are your people?


227
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.380
我沒有家人 就我一個
I don't have people. I'm alone.


228
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:57.590
漢......
Han...


229
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.720
Solo也有孤身一人的意思

230
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.720

234
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.740
很快你就能當上飛行員了
We'll have you flying in no time.


235
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:18.890
三年後

236
00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.830
帝國現在需要你 前進 士兵們
Your Empire needs you. Troopers forward!

索羅 起來 我們很快就到了
Solo, get up! We're almost there!


238
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.440
快到哪兒了 我們要去哪兒
Almost where? Where are we going?


239
00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.400
只要越過最後一道山脊 勝利就...
Just over that last ridge. Victory is...


240
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:50.940
我的腿 我的腿
My legs! My leg!


241
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.340
嘿 貝克特 你說來這
Hey, Beckett, you said we were here


242
00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.700
要幹一票速戰速決的
to pull a quick job.


243
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.680
- 是啊 - 這哪裡是速戰速決
- Yeah. - Well, this ain't a quick job!


244
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.120
這是持久戰
It's a war!


245
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.680
你總是這麼多廢話
It's always something with you.


246
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.230
我們的目標是奪下步行機運輸船
AT-hauler. That's what we came for.


247
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.650
前線指揮部一定是在這邊
Forward operations must be this way.


248
00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.320
沒錯 但少校說我們應該走這邊
They are, but the major said we're supposed to go that way!


249
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.330
是啊 走那邊送死吧
Yeah, go that way and die!


250
00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:29.930
你說的對 少校已經死了
That's exactly what happened to the major!


251
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.270
現在誰是最高指揮官
Who's the ranking officer now?


252
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.000
是你 上尉
You are, Captain.


253
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.450
他說的沒錯呢
He's got you there.


254
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.820
有什麼計畫 貝克特上尉
So what's the plan, Captain Beckett?


255
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.180
瓦爾 你帶裡奧和這四個泥腿子包抄左翼
Val, you take Rio and these four mud skulls flank left.


256
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.770
我帶上這個大嘴巴
I'll take this mouthy scooch


257
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.020
繞道右翼 然後...
and we'll go around to the right


258
00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.250
沒准我們運氣好
and maybe we'll get lucky.


259
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:51.970
我們才不需要運氣呢
Luck's got nothin' to do with it.


260
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:55.000
等等 一個問題 就一個問題
Wait! One question!


261
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.280
- 想活命嗎 吉祥物 - 當然想了
- You wanna live, sparky? - Very much.


262
00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.810
那就閉嘴 聽從上尉的命令就行
Then shut up and do what your captain tells you.


263
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.100
我們沖
Let's go!


264
00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.140
上尉
Captain.


265
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.490
T-15 報廢了 我們走進去
T-15s are down. We walk from here.


266
00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.650
上尉
Captain.


267
00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:23.930
我是漢
I'm Han.


268
00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.620
沒興趣聽你介紹
Nobody cares.


269
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.160
剛才謝謝您 上尉
Thanks for your help back there.


270
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.460
你也不錯
You did all right.


271
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.100
我接受過空戰訓練 所以...
I was trained in aerial combat...


272
00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.050
想聽我的建議嗎
You want some advice?


273
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.310
趕緊離開這個鬼地方
Get the hell away from here.


274
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:39.890
不管去哪 越快越好
Any way you can, as fast as you can.


275
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.210
你指揮哪個連隊
What company do you command?


276
00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:45.980
跟你有什麼關係麼
None of your business company.


277
00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:47.890
我們滿員了
And we're full up.


278
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.280
當好你的兵 孩子
Stick to soldiering, kid.


279
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.760
別跟著我們
You don't want any part of this.


280
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:59.600
等等 兄弟們
Hang on, guys!


281
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.170
注意
Attention!


282
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:06.470
三小時後我們出發前往南部沼澤
In three hours, we move out for the southern marshlands.


283
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.130
我需要一隻十人先鋒隊
I want an advance party of ten men.


284
00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.010
真棒 又能吃土了
Great, more mud.


285
00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.210
你說什麼
What was that?


286
00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:16.060
我只是在想我們的目標是什麼 上尉
Just wondering what our objective is, Lieutenant.


287
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.920
為銀河系帶來和平與繁榮
Bring peace and prosperity to the galaxy,


288
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:20.910
建立忠於皇帝的新政權
install a regime loyal to the Emperor,


289
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:22.960
消滅敵對勢力
and eradicate the hostiles.


290
00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.250
這裡是他們的星球 我們才是敵人
It's their planet, we're the hostiles.


291
00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.500
你有什麼意見麼 士兵
You got a problem, trooper?


292
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.060
沒意見 長官
No problem, sir.


293
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.040
全體出發
Moving out.


294
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.940
向南部沼澤 全體出發
To the southern marshlands! Move out!


295
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.000
執行命令 出發
You heard 'em! Let's move out!


296
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.230
嗯 看起來他們每半小時
Mmm. Looks like they're running sorties


297
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.860
出動一次
every 30 minutes.


298
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.370
是呀 我們可以解決警戒線上的衛兵
Yeah, I can take out the guards at the perimeter,


299
00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:54.720
信號兵 飛行員
signalman, pilot.


300
00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.210
見鬼 都解決了吧
Hell, I'll just take 'em all out.


301
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.640
你們在看什麼
What are we looking at?


302
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.220
你小子怎麼有
You have a talent for sticking your nose in


303
00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.660
多管閒事的習慣
where it doesn't belong.


304
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.270
我想不注意到都難
I just couldn't help but notice


305
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.580
我看你們穿著滿是鐳射槍彈孔的軍裝
you're wearing a uniform pock-full of laser burns.


306
00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.130
你們要麼是刀槍不入
So either you heal real quick


307
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.310
要麼就是穿著從死人身上扒下來的軍裝
or you stole it off a dead man.


308
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.490
你們不是帝國士兵
You're not Imperial Army.


309
00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:16.990
你們像是偷軍火的
You're thieves here to steal equipment


310
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.860
我要入夥
for a job and I want in.


311
00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.290
- 我們崩了他算了 - 不
- Well, now we gotta shoot him. - No.


312
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.390
擰斷脖子更乾脆一些
Snap his neck. It's less mess.


313
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:25.810
或者你們帶我走
Or you take me with you.


314
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.560
我從小就在克雷利亞星球的街頭坑蒙拐騙
Look, I came up running scams on the streets of Corellia.


315
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.060
我十歲就開始偷AV-21
I was boosting AV-21s when I was ten.


316
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.940
我會開車 開飛船
I'm a driver, a flyer,


317
00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:36.430
而且你自己也跟我說過 我得離開這 對吧
and hey, you said yourself. I gotta get outta here. Right?


318
00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.000
這麼棒的飛行員這麼下來趟泥水了
What's a fancy flyboy doing down in the mud?


319
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.270
這個 因為我思想獨立
I got kicked out of the Imperial Academy


320
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:43.860
所以被帝國飛行學院開除了
for having a mind of my own.


321
00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.380
但我可是個很不錯的飛行員 我要回到我的故鄉
But I am a great pilot. And I gotta get home.


322
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.020
這傢伙瘋了 誰會想回克雷利亞啊
This guy is nuts. No one goes back to Corellia.


323
00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.520
我回那自有我的原因
I got a reason.


324
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.680
我們有很棒的飛行員了
We've already got a great pilot.


325
00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.310
這個阿迪尼亞人
The Ardennian.


326
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:58.480
阿迪尼亞人 你不想活了嗎
Ardennian? You got a lot of nerve, pal.


327
00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.950
我是一名帝國士兵
I'm an Imperial trooper.


328
00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:01.190
真的嗎 你屁股上
Oh, really? A couple of your arms


329
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:02.040
長了兩隻胳膊
popped out of your butt


330
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.810
把褲子撐長這麼大 士兵
and hiked up your pants, trooper.


331
00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:04.610
胡扯
Oh, yeah?


332
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:07.050
聽著 無論如何我要回克雷利亞
Look, I'll do whatever it takes to get back to Corellia.


333
00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:08.310
我等不起了
I've already been away too long.


334
00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.270
給個機會 謝謝您 長官
Just give me a shot.


335
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.010
等等  等等
Whoa. Hold it.


336
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.500
好吧 如果您對我沒什麼興趣
Well, if you're not interested in me,


337
00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.540
那中尉應該會對你非常感興趣
I think the lieutenant might be very interested in you.


338
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:23.610
你威脅我
Blackmail.


339
00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:27.020
中尉
Lieutenant.


340
00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.040
上尉
Captain.


341
00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.600
中尉 我們逮捕了一名逃兵
Lieutenant, we have apprehended a deserter.


342
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.540
把他帶走
Take him.


343
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.370
我說 等一下
Wait.


344
00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.380
我就知道 你小子不是個好東西
I should've known. This one's a troublemaker.


345
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.620
他還是個騙子 他說的話可別信
And a liar. Don't believe anything he says.


346
00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.750
- 別丟下我 - 快點帶走
- Don't go anywhere without me. - All right, let's go.


347
00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:42.030
把他喂野獸
Feed him to the beast.


348
00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.760
野獸 這有野獸嗎
The beast? Wait, there's a beast?


349
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.010
- 等等 - 快走
- Hold on! - Move it!


350
00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.260
那傢伙是冒名頂替的
Listen, that guy's not even an officer. All right?


351
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.560
- 他在說謊 - 閉嘴
- He was lying! - Quiet!


352
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:51.430
我懶得管
Don't care.


353
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.080
有三天沒喂他了
Haven't fed him in three days.


354
00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.310
有好看的了
Should be fun.


355
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.310
大個子
Oh! Hey! Hey, big fella.


356
00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.060
冷靜一點 放鬆
Just calm down. Take it easy.


357
00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:50.660
咱倆是一夥的
We're on the same side.


358
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.410
想吃點什麼
You like treats?


359
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:56.460
救命 讓我離開這
Help! Let me out of here!


360
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.670
讓我離開這
Let me out of here!


361
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:02.810
抓住你了
A-ha! Gotcha!


362
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:25.510
感覺越來越精彩啊
Ah, this was just getting good.


363
00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:26.890
它殺得太快了 對
- He killed him too fast. - Yeah!


364
00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.230
慢點殺他
Kill him slower.


365
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.470
等等等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait!


366
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:35.080
等等......
Wait! Wait!


367
00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:39.920
我會說一點伍基話
Yeah, I speak a little.


368
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.880
你聽我說...
Now just listen to me, you...


369
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.250
對對對
Yes, yes!


370
00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:05.160
不不不
No, no, no, no!


371
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
來吧
Do it!


372
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.280
來啊
Come on.


373
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.650
不
Oh, no!


374
00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:15.830
賭十個信用點 他活不過一分鐘
Ten credits, he doesn't last another minute.


375
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.730
讓我離開這裡
Let me out of here!


376
00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:19.530
我實在是受不了了
I can't take it anymore!


377
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.770
不 住手  求你了
- Oh, no! Stop, please! - That's it. Get him!


378
00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:27.530
你沒勁了 你這骯髒的凱西克擠奶工
You tired, you mangy Kashyyykian moof-milker?


379
00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.280
聽我的 沒錯吧
See what happens when you listen to me?


380
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.270
你要幹什麼
Hey, what are you doing?


381
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:51.490
跟我來
Follow me!


382
00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.790
等等過來
Wait, wait.


383
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.730
聽我說 聽我說
Come here. Listen to me.


384
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:06.720
你不明白
You don't understand, okay?


385
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.670
我有一群好朋友
I have some very good friends


386
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:08.810
在那個機場等我
waiting for me at that airfield.


387
00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:10.250
他們馬上要走了
They're leaving right now.


388
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:11.970
離開這裡就靠他們了
That's our one way off this mud ball.


389
00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.640
如果你想活命我們走那邊
If you wanna live, we go that way.


390
00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.150
然後你愛去哪去哪 我不管
After that, you go whichever way you want, I don't care!


391
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:18.300
但是現在 快往那邊走
But right now, that's the way you go!


392
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.060
相信我
Trust me!


393
00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.020
瓦爾 我們走
Val, let's go!


394
00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:31.260
他們穿這玩意是怎麼呼吸的 太悶了
How do they breathe in these suits? It's so stuffy!


395
00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.220
怪不得他們飛行技術的那麼爛
No wonder they're such lousy pilots.


396
00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.930
沒法轉頭 沒法呼吸
You can't turn your head, you can't breathe,


397
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.360
聽不到隊友說什麼
you can't hear each other!


398
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.810
活見鬼了
I'll be damned.


399
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.310
看誰回來了
Hey, look who's back!


400
00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.620
簡直難以置信
Unbelievable!


401
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.440
等等
Wait!


402
00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.330
等一下
Wait!


403
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:54.010
那是一個伍基人嗎 不可思議
Whoa, is that a Wookiee? Incredible!


404
00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:55.370
實話實說
I'll say it, I don't care.


405
00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:56.950
我開始喜歡這孩子了
This kid's growing on me.


406
00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.920
等等
Wait!


407
00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:03.570
幹這種活
You know, we could always use


408
00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.630
多幾個幫手總會有用的
some muscle on a job like this.


409
00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.650
別打這主意
Don't even think about it!


410
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.080
我跟你講 躺在伍基人的膝蓋上睡覺
I'm telling you, you will never have a deeper sleep


411
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.840
是件非常愜意的事情
than curled up in a Wookiee's lap.


412
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.460
我跟你說過了
I told you!


413
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.590
非常好的朋友
Very good friends!


414
00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.220
這種事情不能一個一個來嗎
We couldn't have done this maybe, like, one at a time?


415
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:20.120
真得感謝你幫我離開那裡
Thanks for helping me get outta there.


416
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.410
都是因為我 他們才帶上你
No, they only took you because of me.


417
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.490
我跟他們做了一筆非常棒的交易
I got us a real sweet deal here.


418
00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.540
只要跟他們一起幹上一票
We do this one job with them,


419
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:37.450
我們賺上一大筆錢
we make some real money,


420
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.650
然後我們就自由了
and then we're free.


421
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:41.800
你多久沒有享受過自由了
When's the last time you could say that?


422
00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.500
我也很久沒自由過了
Been a while for me, too.


423
00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:51.230
那麼你叫什麼名字
So what's your name, anyway?


424
00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:57.000
丘巴卡
Chewbacca?


425
00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.380
這個名字...我得給你起個外號
All right, well, you're gonna need a nickname,


426
00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.200
不然喊你的名字太麻煩了
'cause I ain't saying that every time.


427
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.460
他來了 你看一下
Here it comes. Take a look.


428
00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:13.080
列車走到塔和橋中間的時候 我們就動手
We hit the Conveyex between the tower and the bridge.


429
00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.320
裡奧送我們上去 我們拆下貨箱
Rio drops us in, we separate the payload container,


430
00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.950
把它吊在步行運輸機上 然後...
cable it up to the AT-hauler and then...


431
00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.840
裡奧干擾他們的報警信號
Rio jams their distress signal.


432
00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.620
我炸毀橋
I blow the bridge,


433
00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.560
然後從軌道上把車廂吊走
the container slides right off the track


434
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.010
我們一走了之
and we sail away.


435
00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:27.810
如果觸發報警信號
You trip that security beam,


436
00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:28.980
啟動了蝮蛇機器人
wake up those Vipers,


437
00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.440
那情況就會變得非常危險
it's liable to get real spicy, real fast.


438
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.620
你需要擔心的人可不是我
Well, I'm not the one you should be worried about.


439
00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.120
恩菲斯•内斯特
Enfys Nest.


440
00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.580
恩菲斯•奈斯特是誰
What's an Enfys Nest?


441
00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.750
我跟你說過 我們幹的這一票
I told you, we're way ahead


442
00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.570
不會有人插手的
of the competition on this one.


443
00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.830
恩菲斯•内斯特甚至不知道
There's no way Enfys Nest


444
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:42.930
這批貨運輸的消息
even knows about this shipment.


445
00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.700
只有我那邊的人知道這消息
Only my guy has the intel.


446
00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.230
那你的人最好別出差錯
Well, you better be right. Yeah?


447
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.440
因為有的時候
Because sometimes, you put your faith


448
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:50.860
你也會看錯人
in the wrong people.


449
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.590
我們的未來都壓在這一票上
Our whole future depends on this one score


450
00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:56.950
你卻帶上兩個生手
and you bring in amateurs.


451
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.230
可能你沒注意到
In case you hadn't noticed,


452
00:26:58.270 --> 00:26:59.910
我們真的缺人手
we're a little shorthanded.


453
00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.430
那就去找啊
So we get who we need.


454
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.960
紮恩姐妹 或者是博斯克 你偏不找他們
The Xan sisters, or Bossk.


455
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.290
你把咱倆的命放在
But, no, instead you're putting our lives


456
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:07.910
兩個傻瓜的手上
in the hands of morons.


457
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:10.280
你倆傻嗎
You guys morons?


458
00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.170
不
No!


459
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:13.360
- 聽見了 不 - 我們倆一點不傻
- No. See? - We're not morons.


460
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.370
我一直在等待一個這樣的機會
Look, I waited a long time for a shot like this.


461
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:18.220
我不會搞砸的
I'm not about to screw it up, all right?


462
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:20.180
哦 好了 瓦爾
Oh, come on, Val!


463
00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:21.850
你看他多真誠啊
He looks so sincere.


464
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.270
再說拒絕
Plus, have you ever tried to disinvite


465
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.400
一個伍基人
a Wookiee to anything?


466
00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.970
後果可一點都不好
Not a good idea!


467
00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:28.360
這一點也不好笑
This is not funny!


468
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:32.890
聽著 直覺告訴我 他們兩個靠得住
Look, now, I have great instincts about these guys.


469
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:36.800
再說了 我們還有其他選擇嗎
And, besides, do you see any other options?


470
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.190
希望你自己心裡有數
I just hope you know what you're doing.


471
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.990
我很清楚我為什麼要這麼做
Yeah, I know exactly what I'm doing and why.


472
00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.890
我們要把債還清
We're gonna clear our debts,


473
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.840
返回格利安塞姆
go back to Glee Anselm,


474
00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.560
我要學會彈梵弦琴
and I'm finally gonna learn how to play that valachord.


475
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.770
哦 寶貝兒 你永遠也學不會彈梵弦琴
Babe, you're never gonna learn how to play the valachord.


476
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.640
說的對 你是個音癡
She's right. You are tone-deaf.


477
00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.570
你遇到過什麼傷心事 小飛哥
So what's your sob story, flyboy?


478
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:59.480
你問我麼
Who, me?


479
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.520
我看的出你心裡有事
You're after something, I know the look.


480
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.220
是不是要報仇
What is it? Revenge?


481
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.690
不 不是報仇
No, it's not revenge.


482
00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.280
你看他
Look at him.


483
00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:08.970
肯定是因為一個姑娘
If it's anything, it's a girl.


484
00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:09.990
哦 姑娘
Oh, a girl!


485
00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:12.600
跟我們講講她 漢 她人怎麼樣
Tell us about the girl, Han. Is she nice?


486
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:14.850
她有尖尖的牙嗎
Does she have sharp teeth?


487
00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:19.340
以前有那麼一個女孩
There was a girl.


488
00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:22.970
當時我逃出來了 而她沒有
But I got out, she didn't.


489
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.690
我發誓要成為一名飛行員
I swore to myself I'd become a pilot,


490
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.780
弄艘船
get a ship,


491
00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:31.170
回去找到她
go back and find her.


492
00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:36.060
幹完這票後就去找她
That's what I'm gonna do right after this job.


493
00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.170
你怎麼知道她還呆在那兒
How you know she'll still be there?


494
00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.690
我就是知道
I just know.


495
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.110
我可不想被任何人束縛住
Personally, I refuse to be tied down


496
00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:44.310
追我的人可多著呢
by anyone, though many have tried.


497
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:47.180
得了吧 裡奧 別逗了
Come on, Rio. You don't fool me.


498
00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.030
人都需要有個伴
Everybody needs somebody.


499
00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:53.550
即便是你這個老騙子也不例外
Even a broken down old crook like this one.


500
00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.260
你分到錢後 打算幹嘛去
How about you? What are you gonna do with your share?


501
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.510
他說什麼
What was he saying?


502
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:21.950
他說伍基人
He said the Wookiees were enslaved


503
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.520
被帝國奴役 遠離家鄉
by the Empire, taken off Kashyyyk.


504
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:26.540
他好像在尋找他的…
He's searching for his, uh...


505
00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:29.980
我不知道是他說的是部落還是家人
I don't know if he said tribe or family.


506
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.630
有區別嗎
What's the difference?


507
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.260
教我怎麼做
Show me how to do that.


508
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.670
你唯一需要學會的是…
The only thing you need to learn to do


509
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.990
按我說的去做
is do what I say when I say it.


510
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.070
明天這個時候
And this time tomorrow,


511
00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.350
你就有足夠的錢
you'll have more than enough


512
00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:49.790
買一艘飛船了
to buy your own ship.


513
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.040
現在開始計時
Starting the clock.


514
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.780
正在干擾信號 距離大橋9.6
Jamming their signal. 9.6 to the bridge.


515
00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.220
拿出你們的真本事來 夥計們
Let's find out how good we really are, folks.


516
00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:30.820
我沒事兒
I'm fine!


517
00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:36.810
瓦爾 你那邊情況如何
Val, how's it going up there?


518
00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.120
一切順利
Never better.


519
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.680
核芯素
Coaxium.


520
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:09.010
足夠一支艦隊用的
Enough to power a fleet!


521
00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:11.550
也可以把我們炸的粉身碎骨
Or blow us all straight to hell!


522
00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.520
好的 告訴我
All right, talk to me.


523
00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:16.960
今天是好日子嗎
Is it a good day?


524
00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.770
堪稱完美
It's a great day!


525
00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.370
你生命最好的一天 貪心鬼
Best day of your life, my grabby friend!


526
00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.570
難說 你從沒有在阿迪尼亞
I don't know, you've never been


527
00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:24.400
享受過邁諾克燒烤
to a Mynock roast on Ardennia.


528
00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.540
那才絕呢
It's nuts!


529
00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:29.360
他們來了
Here they come!


530
00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:31.150
斷開車廂連接器
Get down to the couplers!


531
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.750
裡奧 後撤
Rio, fall back!


532
00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:34.130
他們反應還挺快的
Well, that didn't take 'em long.


533
00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.400
丘伊
Chewie!


534
00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.500
你沒事兒吧
You all right?


535
00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:13.340
你差點就掛了 兄弟
Little close there, buddy!


536
00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:19.480
漢 怎麼還沒好
Han, what's the holdup?


537
00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.600
我們一起來
All right, together.


538
00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:25.420
用力
Now!


539
00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.410
好了
All right!


540
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:40.750
他們解開一邊兒了 你在哪兒呢 夥計
They got one uncoupled. Where are you, buddy?


541
00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.650
我正在規劃退休生活
Just up here planning my retirement.


542
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:43.940
在考慮某個溫暖又不太熱的地方
Thinking about opening a cantina


543
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.310
開個小酒館呢
somewhere warm but not too warm, you know?


544
00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:48.720
快把繩索放出來
Lowering the winch cables now!


545
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.520
我就知道 我早說了 貝克特
I knew it! I told him! Beckett!


546
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:08.760
他來了
He's coming!


547
00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.800
見鬼 這回要被她嘮叨個沒完了
Damn it! I'm never gonna hear the end of this!


548
00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:18.780
那是誰
Who's that?


549
00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:20.370
恩菲斯•内斯特
Enfys Nest!


550
00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.170
土匪 海盜
Marauders, pirates.


551
00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:24.000
想來從我們嘴裡搶吃的
Come to snake the score from under us.


552
00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:26.760
準備發射纜繩
Ready your harpoons.


553
00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:27.760
沖上去
Move in.


554
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.660
等一下 我這裡有位不速之客
Hang on! I got an uninvited guest.


555
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:14.110
從我的船裡滾出去
Get off of my ship!


556
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:20.170
你還好嗎 兄弟
You still with us, brother?


557
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:22.130
噢 我還好
Yeah, I'm okay.


558
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:24.190
就是一邊的肩膀劃破了 沒什麼
Just nicked one of my shoulders. It's nothing.


559
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:25.970
他一點都不好
He's not okay.


560
00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:34.590
丘伊
Chewie!


561
00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:36.960
得靠你一個人解開這邊了
You gotta uncouple this one on your own!


562
00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.730
漢
Han!


563
00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.050
我知道了
I'm on it!


564
00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:55.750
瓦爾
Val!


565
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:58.740
眼睛睜大點 我們觸發了一個感測器
Keep your eyes open. We just tripped a sensor.


566
00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.790
蝮蛇機器人朝你們去了
Viper droids headed your way!


567
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:08.960
裡奧
Rio?


568
00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.170
嗯 情況不妙
Yeah, it looks worse than it is.


569
00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.930
得包紮一下
Just gotta patch it up.


570
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.340
也許得小睡一會
Maybe rest my eyes for a minute.


571
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:38.510
夠了 我自己來
Enough! I'm going in.


572
00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.210
你沒撒謊 小夥子
You weren't lying, kid.


573
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:08.250
技術真不賴
You're a hell of a pilot.


574
00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:09.650
裡奧 夥計 挺住
Rio, stay with me, buddy.


575
00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.590
貝克特 我們有一根纜繩斷了
Beckett, we just lost a cable!


576
00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.570
距離大橋2.1

577
00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.310
一個人死真沒勁 小夥子
It's no good to die alone, kid.


578
00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.320
瓦爾說得對
Val was right.


579
00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.080
裡奧
Rio?


580
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:12.580
貝克特 距離大橋0.8
Beckett, we're .8 from the bridge!


581
00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.780
瓦爾還在軌道上
Val's still on the track!


582
00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:17.680
瓦爾你快離開那座橋
Val, you gotta get off that bridge!


583
00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:18.590
我們來了
We're here!


584
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.790
它們把我困在這了
They got me pinned!


585
00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.010
我得在這裡動手了
I'm gonna have to finish the job from right here.


586
00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.650
什麼
What?


587
00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:30.330
我不虛此生 寶貝
It's been a ride, babe.


588
00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.900
跟你在一起的日子是我最珍貴的一段時光
And I wouldn't trade it for anything.


589
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:35.630
瓦爾
Val!


590
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:36.900
不
No!


591
00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:44.780
不
No!


592
00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.240
丘伊 快
Chewie, now!


593
00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.790
貝克特 我拉不過他們
Beckett, I can't pull it away from 'em.


594
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.920
他們會放手的 你儘管飛
They'll let go, you fly straight!


595
00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.790
快鬆開纜繩
Release your cables


596
00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:33.270
要不然就要死了
or die!


597
00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:35.250
我們太近了
We're too close.


598
00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.380
我得鬆開
I gotta release.


599
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:37.860
照我說的做 漢
You do what I tell you, Han!


600
00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:39.310
丘伊 抓住纜繩
Chewie, grab the line!


601
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.740
不許斷開
Don't you do it!


602
00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.240
漢
Han!


603
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.840
你這個懦夫
You coward!


604
00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.950
你幹什麼
What the hell?


605
00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.680
你不聽話 也不服從命令
You don't listen and you can't follow orders!


606
00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.140
你知不知道你都幹了什麼
You have any idea what you've done?


607
00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.050
偷這批貨不是為了我們自己
We were not stealing for ourselves,


608
00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.670
我們是受雇于血紅黎明的
we were hired by Crimson Dawn.


609
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.290
血紅黎明
Crimson Dawn?


610
00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:55.650
我們欠了他們100千克的精煉核芯素
Now we owe them 100 keys of refined coaxium.


611
00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:57.850
要是他們發現我們沒把東西弄到手
When they find out we don't got it,


612
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:59.920
就會殺了我們
they're gonna kill us.


613
00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:02.610
對
Right.


614
00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.040
趕緊逃
We run.


615
00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.950
我已經是個逃兵了 沒什麼區別了
I'm already a deserter. What's the difference?


616
00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.290
你說區別
The difference


617
00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:09.950
如果你是一名逃兵
is the Empire doesn't send out


618
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:12.280
帝國可不會派出一隊殺手
a team of enforcers to hunt you down


619
00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.800
去追殺你
when you're a deserter.


620
00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.320
可德賴登•沃斯會
Dryden Vos will.


621
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:18.410
你知道有人懸賞
You have any idea what it's like


622
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:20.350
要你的命是什麼感覺嗎
to live with a price on your head?


623
00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:24.600
你唯一能做的就是請罪
The only thing to do is to go to them.


624
00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:27.060
也許我能想個辦法來補償他
Maybe I can find some way to make it up to him.


625
00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.060
那就按你說的來
Then that's what we do.


626
00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:39.060
不好吧
No.


627
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:45.560
他們認識我 不認識你
He knows me, not you.


628
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:48.910
如果你跟著我一起過去
If you come with me


629
00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.850
一旦露面
and show your face,


630
00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:53.690
哪怕他們留你一命
if they don't kill you,


631
00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.350
你這輩子就得一直幹這行了
you're in this life for good.


632
00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.440
如果你能想個辦法解決這件事
You find some way to square this,


633
00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:06.220
我們還能拿到錢嗎
we still get our money?


634
00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.420
也許吧
Maybe.


635
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:14.240
那我們就值得為之冒險
For me, it's worth the risk.


636
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:17.910
你覺得呢
How about you?


637
00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.750
他同意了
That's yes.


638
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:31.860
抱歉 我剛打了你一拳
Sorry I punched your face.


639
00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.250
挨揍這種事對我來說是家常便飯了
Happens more often than you think.


640
00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.270
我們上去之後
So when we get up there,


641
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:39.550
德賴登•沃斯就在伊普索堡等我們麼
Dryden Vos is waiting for us at Fort Ypso?


642
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.700
他的船就在附近
Nearby, on his yacht.


643
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:44.770
你知道船在哪嗎
You're gonna know how to find it?


644
00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:46.420
那根本不成問題
That won't be a problem.


645
00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.370
把你們的武器交出來
I'll need to check your weapons.


646
00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.210
我就剩這一件武器了
That's all I got left.


647
00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.620
我來找德賴登 他在等著見我
I'm here to see Dryden. He's expecting me.


648
00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.050
他馬上來見你
He'll be with you shortly.


649
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:20.210
他和區域總督的會面剛剛結束
He's just finishing with the regional governor.


650
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:26.730
打擾 長官
Excuse me, sir.


651
00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:27.790
說
Yes.


652
00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.770
貝克特到了
- Beckett has arrived. - Oh.


653
00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:36.470
把這放我辦公室 待會可能要用
Put this in my office. I might be needing it later.


654
00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:45.460
我發什麼火嘛 真是的
I get all worked up. Silly.


655
00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:47.030
這可是宴會 應該開心一點
It's a party.


656
00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:54.820
這裡的人可不是你朋友
These people are not your friends


657
00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:57.570
你永遠都不可能成為他們的朋友 所以別跟任何人說話
and they're never gonna be, so don't talk to any of 'em.


658
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:58.780
所以眼睛也別亂瞟
Don't look at anybody,


659
00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:00.610
把頭低下看路
just keep your eyes down.


660
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.950
我得去喝一杯
I might get a drink.


661
00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.210
不 好吧 隨便
No, yeah, whatever.


662
00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:41.040
丘伊 你能不能...
Chewie, would you please...


663
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.920
琦拉 你怎麼在這
Qi'ra, what are you doing here?


664
00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.280
我在這工作
I work here.


665
00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.320
你怎麼在這
What's your excuse?


666
00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.650
我 我
My... I...


667
00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:58.320
琦 琦拉...我...
Qi'ra, I was...


668
00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:03.030
我正想著回去找你呢
I was coming back for you.


669
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:05.550
那些日子都過去了 漢
It's in the past, Han.


670
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:06.180
我可不這麼想
Not for me.


671
00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.150
我來到這
The only reason I'm here,


672
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:08.750
就是想做份工作賺一點錢
I was doing this job, get a little money


673
00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.490
然後回克雷利亞去找你
and then I was gonna come back to Corellia and find you.


674
00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:13.640
現在你不必了
Well, now you don't have to.


675
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:16.640
我就站在你面前
I'm right in front of you.


676
00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:20.150
那天
That day...


677
00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.900
有時候我經常在想
Sometimes, a lot of times, I think...


678
00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.200
如果你留下...
If you'd have stayed,


679
00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:26.480
他們會殺了你的
they would've killed you.


680
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:29.910
你能逃走 我很高興
I'm glad you got out.


681
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:35.650
你是怎麼脫身的
How did you get out?


682
00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:41.280
我沒有脫身
I didn't.


683
00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.240
你氣色不錯
You look good.


684
00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.020
有一點不修邊幅
A little rough around the edges,


685
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.420
但挺精神
but good.


686
00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.060
你也是
You too.


687
00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.000
謝謝 奧蒂莉
Thank you, Ottilie.


688
00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:55.630
你在關注多克•昂達嗎
Have you been attentive to Dok-Ondar?


689
00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:56.700
當然
Very.


690
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:02.180
我們為什麼舉杯呢
What should we drink to?


691
00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:05.430
不管為什麼 先喝兩杯在說
Let's drink two and see where it goes.


692
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.120
你弄到那艘可以讓我們遠走高飛的船了嗎
Did you ever get that ship we were going to fly away on?


693
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.310
快了 也差不多
Yeah. Sort of.


694
00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:20.660
馬上吧 所以我來這兒是準備...
About to. That's why I'm here.


695
00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.040
我正在做一筆
I'm working on a...


696
00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.990
大買賣
Very big deal.


697
00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:26.150
有多大
How big?


698
00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:27.350
非常大
Enormous.


699
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.930
真的假的 那你什麼時候搞定這筆大買賣
Really? And when are you going to close this enormous deal?


700
00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:32.620
可能下一秒就搞定了
Any minute.


701
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.300
我經常想起你
I thought about you a lot.


702
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.580
你在某個地方冒險
Off somewhere, some adventure.


703
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:42.710
我想像自己在你身邊 那樣總能讓我...
I imagined myself with you. It always made me...


704
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:47.440
- 什麼 - 嘿
- What? - Hey.


705
00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:49.560
我怎麼跟你說的
What did I say?


706
00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.650
聽著 我不可能一直低著頭
Look, I can't keep my eyes down the whole time.


707
00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:53.130
那樣我會撞上東西的
I'm gonna bump into something.


708
00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:54.470
我說別跟任何人說話 你怎麼...
But I told you not to talk to anyone.


709
00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:55.540
貝克特
Beckett.


710
00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:59.290
等等 你們在一起做事
Wait. You two work together?


711
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.670
- 對 - 托拜西
- Yeah. - Tobias!


712
00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:05.310
德賴登
Dryden.


713
00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:07.360
你好嗎 有沒有受傷
Are you all right? Are you hurt?


714
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:09.230
沒有 我很好
No, I'm fine.


715
00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.950
瓦爾的事我很抱歉
I'm sorry to hear about Val.


716
00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:13.410
謝謝你 但是...
Yeah, I appreciate that.


717
00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:14.750
我們沒想到會...
But there was no way we could've anticipated...


718
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:17.320
我想我們倆沒見過面吧
I don't believe we've been introduced.


719
00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:20.360
對 這是漢•索羅和丘巴卡
Yeah. This is Han Solo and Chewbacca.


720
00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:21.960
他們是跟我一起的
They're with me.


721
00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:23.690
我是德賴登•沃斯
I'm Dryden Vos.


722
00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:27.550
看來你們已經見過我的高級助理了...
I see you've already met my top lieutenant.


723
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:32.170
漢和我一起在科雷利亞長大
Han and I grew up together on Corellia.


724
00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:35.260
一個窩出來的
Oh, fellow scrumrat.


725
00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:38.690
我欽佩那些那些靠自己爬出下水道的人
I admire anyone who can crawl their way out of the sewer.


726
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:41.610
尤其是像科雷利亞那樣骯髒的下水道
Especially, a sewer as putrid as Corellia.


727
00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.670
臭烘烘的 我說的對吧
The stench, am I right?


728
00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:46.310
很高興見到你
Well, it's good to have you.


729
00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:48.220
歡迎
Welcome.


730
00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:50.600
你也是 丘巴卡 歡迎
And you, too, Chewbacca, welcome.


731
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:55.300
好了 我們少吃點兒 多喝點兒
All right, let's eat a little, drink a lot,


732
00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:56.650
然後私下聊聊
and talk privately.


733
00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.250
他們只是朋友
We're just friends, all right?


734
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:03.180
你太敏感了
You're touchy.


735
00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:07.740
貝克特 你給我出了一個大難題
Beckett, you have put me in a terrible position.


736
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:09.870
我知道 德賴登 我非常抱歉
I know, Dryden, and I am sorry.


737
00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:10.860
你很抱歉
You're sorry?


738
00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:12.360
德賴登 事情很複雜
Dryden, there were complications.


739
00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:13.150
有些原因
There were factors.


740
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:16.570
恩菲斯•内斯特 一直都在找我們的麻煩
Enfys Nest has been a constant irritation forever.


741
00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:18.180
你應該能預料到這個情況的
It's one you should've anticipated,


742
00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:19.740
你應該能解決這個的
it's one you should've dealt with.


743
00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:21.230
我知道我犯了個錯誤
Trust me, I know I made a mistake,


744
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:24.220
但是你雇我的時候
but when you hired me, you told me


745
00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:25.220
你跟我說沒有其他人知道
no one else had this information...


746
00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:26.610
夠了
Test me!


747
00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.580
你敢再囉嗦一個字試試看
Test me one more time, you'll see what happens.


748
00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:33.040
我認為德賴登想說的是
I think what Dryden is trying to say


749
00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.970
我們沒興趣知道 你為什麼現在沒拿到貨
is that we're not interested in why you don't have it.


750
00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:38.030
對 我不感興趣
No, I'm not interested.


751
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:39.840
我一點兒都不感興趣
I'm not interested at all.


752
00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:41.100
德賴登
Dryden,


753
00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:43.080
我該怎麼做才能挽回這一切
what can I do to make this right?


754
00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:44.990
挽回這一切
"Make this right?"


755
00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:47.450
沒什麼可以挽回的
There is no making this right.


756
00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:48.990
你知道我老闆是誰
You know who I answer to


757
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:51.340
你也知道他對我有什麼期待
and you know what he'll expect of me.


758
00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:53.480
他會說 你必須承擔後果
He'll say, "There have to be consequences."


759
00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:57.200
所以接下來我需要你做一件事
So here's what I need you to do for me.


760
00:48:57.330 --> 00:49:00.870
我需要你給我一個...
I need you to give me a reason


761
00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:03.970
不殺你們的理由
not to kill you all.


762
00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:05.930
因為我一定會對你作出補償
Because I will make it up to you.


763
00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:07.210
不 怎麼補 你怎麼補償我
No, no, no. How?


764
00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:08.500
我會遵守之前的約定
How will you make it up to me?


765
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:11.900
把貨交給你
By delivering exactly what was promised.


766
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:15.560
還是100千克精煉核芯素嗎

767
00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:19.000
是的 我們會從其它的地方給你偷來
Yes. We will simply steal it from somewhere else.


768
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.430
從什麼地方
From where?


769
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:21.640
除了帝國倉庫
You'll be hard pushed to find that


770
00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:23.320
你很難在其他地方找到核芯素
anywhere outside an Imperial vault.


771
00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.310
斯卡裡夫 或者仁慈島
Scarif. Maybe Mercy Island.


772
00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.650
那是不可能的
That's impossible.


773
00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:29.350
所以我們想想其它辦法
So, let's come up with some other options.


774
00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:30.710
其它能讓我們...
Other ideas that we might...


775
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:32.620
沒有精煉的行不行
What about unrefined?


776
00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:38.820
唯一已知的 不穩定核芯素來源
Well, the only known source of astatic coaxium


777
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:41.820
是科舍爾星球香料礦的地下裂縫
is a fissure vent beneath the spice mines on Kessel.


778
00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.050
對 我想的就是這裡
Yeah. That's the one I was thinking of.


779
00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:45.680
那個來源地非常棒
That's a very, very good one.


780
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.980
但是科舍爾由派克人控制著
But see, the Pykes control Kessel.


781
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:49.050
血紅黎明與派克人
Crimson Dawn maintains


782
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:51.390
保持著脆弱的同盟關係
a fragile alliance with the Pykes.


783
00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.750
我不能破壞這關係
It's one that I can't jeopardize


784
00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.880
不然就會引起全面的幫派衝突
without risking an all-out war with the Syndicates,


785
00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:59.060
所以聽著 先生們 我絕不會同意
and that, gentlemen, I will not do.


786
00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:02.860
那麼如果沒有其他提議 我們的談話到此為止
So, if that's all you have, I think we're done here.


787
00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:03.720
我們還有話要說
Not all we have.


788
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:06.750
我們跟派克人可沒有同盟關係
We don't have any alliance with the Pykes.


789
00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:09.220
對 沒人知道我們是為你效力的
Right, so nobody is gonna know we're working for you.


790
00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:20.210
有可能成功麼
Possible?


791
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:21.940
有風險
It's risky.


792
00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:24.640
一旦將沒加工的核芯素取出倉庫
As soon as the raw coaxium is removed from the vault,


793
00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.290
它會變得不穩定
it starts to destabilize,


794
00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:27.930
所以除非
so unless...


795
00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:29.460
除非
Unless...


796
00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:31.060
除非...
Unless...


797
00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.810
配合一下嘛
Work with me here.


798
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:34.600
除非你能找個地方
Unless you could find somewhere


799
00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.300
馬上對它進行精煉
to get it processed fast.


800
00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:39.790
那個...
Well...


801
00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:42.140
他說薩瓦林
He's saying Savareen?


802
00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:43.490
薩瓦林
Savareen.


803
00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.400
對 那兒有一個老舊的精煉廠
Yeah, it's an old refinery there


804
00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.590
那地方不受帝國的管轄
and it's not under Imperial jurisdiction.


805
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:49.330
琦拉說得對
But Qi'ra's right.


806
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:52.820
在你們抵達前儲藏罐就會爆炸 所以...
The canisters will explode before you get there,


807
00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.200
你們需要 一艘非常快的船
so you'd need an incredibly fast ship


808
00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:56.910
和一流的飛行員
and a brilliant pilot.


809
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:58.560
我們會找到船的
We'll find a ship.


810
00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.270
飛行員已經有了
We've already got the pilot.


811
00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:08.720
他很傲慢 也很有野心
He is arrogant and he's hungry.


812
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:09.710
你怎麼看 親愛的
So what do you think, my dear?


813
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:14.510
你覺得你的這位朋友 能勝任這次任務嗎
You think your friend here can do what needs to be done?


814
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:23.000
是的 我覺得他可以
Yes, I believe he can.


815
00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:25.900
這是個好消息
Well, that is good news,


816
00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:27.900
因為你要跟著他
because you're going with him


817
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:30.460
確保他做到
to see that he does.


818
00:51:31.810 --> 00:51:33.680
好嗎
All right?


819
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:35.910
沒問題
Of course.


820
00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:39.090
好的
All right.


821
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.800
我們薩瓦林見
I'll see you all on Savareen.


822
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:41.930
薩瓦林見
Savareen it is.


823
00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:43.770
- 我很看好這個方案 - 我也是
- I feel great about this plan. - Me, too.


824
00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:45.500
我們應該常聊聊 很有意思
We should do this again. It's been fun.


825
00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:46.550
是啊
Great.


826
00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:48.210
對了 還有一件事兒
Oh, just one more thing.


827
00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.550
如果你們再讓我失望
If you do fail me again,


828
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:53.740
那就沒辦法了
we'll all be out of options.


829
00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:55.410
對吧
Right?


830
00:51:55.410 --> 00:51:56.480
你放心吧
We won't.


831
00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:02.330
一切進行得挺順利的
So, I thought that went really well.


832
00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:04.620
我們儘量快點解決這件事
Let's get this done as quick and as clean as possible.


833
00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:05.510
你們需要什麼
What do you need?


834
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.270
裝備我有辦法弄來
I can scrounge up the gear.


835
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:08.780
你能弄到船嗎
Do you got a line on a ship?


836
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:10.020
我認識一個人
I know a guy.


837
00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:13.740
我知道能去哪兒找到他
And I know just where to find him.


838
00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.800
不是很有希望 但值得一試
It's a long shot, but it's worth a try.


839
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:17.170
他是最厲害的走私犯
He's the best smuggler around.


840
00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:18.320
他從帝國的追捕中逃脫的次數
He's slipped through the Empire's fingers


841
00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:20.460
比任何走私犯都要多
more times than anyone else.


842
00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:23.270
他很有魅力
He's attractive, too.


843
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:24.230
他久經世故
Sophisticated,


844
00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:28.040
品味超凡 而且風流倜儻
with impeccable taste and... Charisma.


845
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:32.140
更不用說他那驚人的...
Not to mention his prodigious...


846
00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:33.220
知道了
We get it.


847
00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:40.990
不過他現在已經金盆洗手了 他說自己是個職業玩家
But he's retired. Says he's a sportsman now.


848
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:42.750
我們只需要他的船
All we need is his ship.


849
00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:44.570
他的船從不外借
Well, he'll never part with it.


850
00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:45.760
他愛死那艘船了
He loves that ship.


851
00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.230
那是他
He won it


852
00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:48.900
玩薩巴卡牌贏來的
playing Sabacc.


853
00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:50.180
那麼問題來了
And there's the rub, right?


854
00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:52.300
我怎麼知道她是個帝國間諜
How was I supposed to know she was an Imperial spy?


855
00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:54.490
我以為她愛我呢
I thought she loved me.


856
00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:56.030
就是那傢伙
That's the guy, huh?


857
00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:59.580
是個有趣的傢伙
An interesting style.


858
00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:00.860
我同意
I'll say.


859
00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:02.780
你說他的船是贏來的
You say he won his ship?


860
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:04.900
你的表情出賣了你 我決定跟你了
You have an awful Sabacc face. I'm gonna call it.


861
00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:06.540
我能贏他 我跟他賭
I can take him. Let me at him.


862
00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:08.000
絕對不行
Absolutely not.


863
00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:10.070
漢 這群人是職業賭徒
Han, these guys are serious gamblers.


864
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:12.220
我也挺專業的 給我點賭注
I'm serious. Stake me.


865
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:14.630
別聽他瞎說
Don't listen to him.


866
00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:23.090
謝謝 謝謝
Thank you. Thank you.


867
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:24.860
各位讓我贏一局如何
You see, how'd you guys let me beat you on that one?


868
00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:25.860
來吧
Come on.


869
00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.300
今天沒有騙子只有玩家
There's no liars in this game, just players.


870
00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:30.890
這個座位沒人吧
Is this seat taken?


871
00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:36.320
沒人坐就是沒人 朋友
If nobody's in the seat, then it ain't taken, friend.


872
00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:41.880
這就是...斯巴克
So this is, uh, Sabacc?


873
00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.030
薩巴卡
Sabacc.


874
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:45.660
薩巴卡 對
Sabacc. Got it.


875
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.910
你玩過嗎
You play it before?


876
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:48.690
玩過幾次
A couple times, yeah.


877
00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.660
我是蘭多•卡瑞辛船長
Captain Lando Calrissian.


878
00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:53.510
漢•索羅
Han Solo.


879
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:55.440
看來你今天手氣不錯呀
Looks like you're having a good day.


880
00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:56.720
我運氣好
I'm a lucky guy.


881
00:53:57.830 --> 00:54:00.510
我能問你個問題嗎 卡瑞辛船長
Can I ask you a question, Captain Calrissian?


882
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.060
隨便問 憨
Anything, Han.


883
00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:05.730
我叫漢 不過沒關係
That's "Han", but that's okay.


884
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:09.370
我聽到過一些關於你的故事 想知道是不是真的
I heard a story about you. I was wondering if it's true.


885
00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:14.120
你聽到的所有關於我的故事 都是真的
Everything you've heard about me is true.


886
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:15.250
謝謝寶貝兒
Thanks, love.


887
00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:17.580
你的船是玩牌贏來的嗎
Did you win your ship playing cards?


888
00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:19.170
我贏過很多東西
Oh, I've won a lot of things.


889
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:23.820
我在奧西恩星帶贏過一顆亞熱帶衛星
I once won a subtropical moon in the Oseon Belt.


890
00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.030
哇
Wow.


891
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:27.160
結果是個賠錢貨
Turned out to be a real money pit.


892
00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:27.890
你真行
I'm impressed.


893
00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:29.190
要是我可不敢把
I don't think I'd have the nerve to gamble


894
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:31.490
自己喜歡的船拿來做賭注
with something I love as much as my ship.


895
00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:33.090
- 是嗎 - 是啊
- Really? - Yeah.


896
00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.560
你開的是什麼船
What do you fly?


897
00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.060
VCX-100
VCX-100.


898
00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:40.490
那可是艘好船 是吧 夥計們
That is a quality ship. Right, boys?


899
00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:42.350
銀河系最快的
It's the fastest in the galaxy,


900
00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:43.780
銀河系其他好船也不少
but there's a lot of great ships out there.


901
00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:46.180
我覺得你的船肯定也很棒
I mean, I'm sure yours is very nice.


902
00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:48.210
只是個代步工具唄
Gets me where I'm goin'.


903
00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:53.830
新手好運
Beginner's luck.


904
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:55.730
玩的不錯
Well played.


905
00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:04.850
看看這次是什麼
Let's see what we got here.


906
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:06.650
好牌呀
Oh, great hand!


907
00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:13.340
抱歉各位 贏我 還差一點兒
Sorry, guys. Close, but not quite.


908
00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:25.120
眼睛看自己的牌 夥計
Eyes on your own cards, buddy.


909
00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.290
所有的眼睛
All of 'em.


910
00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:29.220
看那兒 現在我看見你的了
There. Well, now I see yours.


911
00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:38.660
說我嗎 好 讓我看看...
Oh, that's me? Okay, let's see...


912
00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:43.190
抱歉 負二點
Sorry, minus two.


913
00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:49.810
這遊戲好玩兒
This game is fun.


914
00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.820
好吧 這樣如何
All right, how about this?


915
00:55:51.850 --> 00:55:54.490
我跟你 並且加注
I'll see your bet and I'll raise you.


916
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:58.090
兩千

917
00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:03.400
我跟兩千
I'll see your 2,000


918
00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:05.920
再加注
and I'll raise you


919
00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:08.060
這些我全加上
however much this is.


920
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:12.520
漢
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Han.


921
00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:14.110
悠著點兒
Slow down.


922
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:15.820
你該見好就收
You might wanna quit while you're ahead.


923
00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:17.890
那你該見輸就收嘍
You might wanna quit while you're behind.


924
00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.670
我喜歡這傢伙
I like this kid.


925
00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:22.830
你可真逗
You're adorable.


926
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:24.240
我是認真的
And I'm serious.


927
00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:25.670
我跟你
And I'm calling.


928
00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:27.740
你用什麼跟
With what?


929
00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:28.780
你的圍巾
Your scarf?


930
00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:30.010
可不對我的口味
Not my style.


931
00:56:30.050 --> 00:56:31.220
用我的船
My ship.


932
00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:33.970
賭你的船
Against your ship.


933
00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.750
看看你有沒有這個膽
Time to find out if you got the nerve.


934
00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:42.070
放馬過來
What the hell?


935
00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:47.350
法杖順子
Straight Staves.


936
00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:59.550
你耍我 你可以
You played me. You're good.


937
00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:01.220
- 是啊 - 太會玩兒了
- Yeah. - You're very good.


938
00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:03.580
但還差一點兒
But not good enough.


939
00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:04.770
滿點薩巴克
Full Sabacc.


940
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:13.110
跟你說了見好就收
I told you to quit while you were ahead.


941
00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:17.200
我請大家喝酒
Drinks on me!


942
00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:22.800
對 沒錯
Yeah, that's right.


943
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:31.310
首先 他絕對不可能
First of all, there's no way


944
00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:32.890
有那張綠牌
he could've had that green sylop.


945
00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:33.890
綠牌都出過了
They'd all been played.


946
00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:35.620
而且你的神奇船長
Also, your guy, Captain Wonderful,


947
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:37.070
吹班薩牛不打草稿
is so full of bantha crap...


948
00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:42.660
我的VCX在哪兒呢
Where's my VCX?


949
00:57:43.070 --> 00:57:44.680
現在不在這兒
I don't have it right here now.


950
00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:46.140
目前它在維修廠
It's in the shop.


951
00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:47.920
- 我正在做一些改裝 - 蘭多
- I'm getting some work done. - Lando.


952
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:51.180
琦拉
Qi'ra.


953
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:55.400
你真是光彩奪目 一如既往
You look phenomenal. As always.


954
00:57:55.530 --> 00:57:57.400
因為我要來見你啊
Well, I knew I was gonna see you.


955
00:57:58.110 --> 00:57:59.010
別碰我
Get off!


956
00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:00.440
你跟他們在一起幹嗎
What are you doing with hairy and the boy?


957
00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:02.900
- 不關你的事兒 別問 - 他們為我工作
- There's no need, none. - They work for me.


958
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.170
嗯 好幫手難找啊
Good help is hard to find, no?


959
00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:05.510
我們其實是合作夥伴
We're more like partners.


960
00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:08.110
真的
We are.


961
00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:09.340
失陪一下
Excuse us.


962
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:11.590
聽我說 之前我確定過了
Listen, last I checked,


963
00:58:11.590 --> 00:58:13.290
我跟血紅黎明 已經兩清了
me and Crimson Dawn, we're squared away.


964
00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:15.050
德賴登說了
Dryden said all is forgiven


965
00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:17.260
我為他做完費盧西亞那票 就都一筆勾銷
after I did the whole Felucia thing for him.


966
00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:20.070
這是新買賣 我們要跑科舍爾航線
Yeah. New move, we're making the Kessel Run.


967
00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:23.050
我們需要艘船
We need a ship.


968
00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:24.380
你怎麼不早說
Why didn't you just say so?


969
00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:25.620
我以為你不幹了
I thought you were retired.


970
00:58:27.050 --> 00:58:28.980
我為你破例了
Circumstances change.


971
00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.970
你要多少
How much?


972
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:32.460
科舍爾航線可不太好跑
The Kessel Run.


973
00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:35.300
我要抽百分之五十
That's no easy spin. I'm gonna need half the take.


974
00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:36.750
你想的美
Ridiculous.


975
00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:38.920
噓 小孩別插嘴
Grown-ups are talking.


976
00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:40.390
百分之二十五

977
00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:46.920
你是托拜西•貝克特
You're Tobias Beckett.


978
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:49.190
你殺了奧拉•辛
You killed Aurra Sing.


979
00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:52.810
就推了一下 她肯定是自己摔死的
Pushed her. Pretty sure the fall killed her.


980
00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:55.780
你為銀河系做了件好事 對我來說更是如此
You did the galaxy a favor that day. Me, especially.


981
00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:56.810
我欠她一大筆錢
I owed her a lot of money.


982
00:58:56.810 --> 00:58:58.910
為了表達我的感激之情
And as token of my gratitude,


983
00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:01.560
這票我願意只抽百分之四十
I'm willing to do this for 40%.


984
00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:06.270
二十五

985
00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:13.380
那就百分之二十五

986
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:15.890
不 簡直無法接受
No! Unacceptable!


987
00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:18.020
停止剝削機器人
Stop exploiting droids!


988
00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:20.240
你們這些墮落的生物
You sloppy degenerate bios!


989
00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:21.920
- 她真是沒記性 - 你們不覺得羞恥嗎
- She never learns. - Have you no shame?


990
00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:22.990
誰
Who?


991
00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:23.710
我的大副
My first mate.


992
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:26.260
這跟你有什麼關係 快滾開
You got no business being here. Get out of here!


993
00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:29.170
你怎麼能容忍這種野蠻行為
How can you condone this savagery?


994
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:31.970
你 你 你們不應該這樣做
You, you. You should not be doing this.


995
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:34.610
他們在利用你們取樂
They're using you for entertainment.


996
00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:36.470
對 你們被洗腦了
Yeah. You've been neurowashed.


997
00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:38.700
不要盲目的服從程式
Don't just blindly follow the program.


998
00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:40.720
行使你們的自由意志
Exercise some free will!


999
00:59:41.890 --> 00:59:43.390
離他遠一點兒
Stay away from him!


1000
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:44.830
他從來就沒有這麼好過
He's never had it so good.


1001
00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:47.890
哦 真的嗎 那你跟我打一架呀 你這個傻大個
Oh, really? How about you have a go at me, ya lumpy brute.


1002
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:48.990
那就來啊 來呀
Bring it on! Come on!


1003
00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:49.910
L3
L3!


1004
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:52.170
機器人平等 我們是智慧生命
Droid rights! We are sentient!


1005
00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:54.230
我要關掉你的開關
I'm gonna flip your switch.


1006
00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:56.350
找得到算你贏
Good luck finding it.


1007
00:59:56.350 --> 00:59:57.580
L3
L3!


1008
00:59:59.430 --> 01:00:01.360
別理那個卑鄙小人
Let go of the mean man's face.


1009
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:02.230
該走了
We're leaving.


1010
01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.540
他們這裡都不招待機器人
They don't even serve our kind here.


1011
01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.490
快走
Now.


1012
01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:10.970
這些人是誰
Who are these guys?


1013
01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:12.140
送他們去科舍爾
We're taking them to Kessel.


1014
01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:13.950
你說什麼
Oh, are we?


1015
01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:16.890
如果我不想去科舍爾呢
And what if I don't elect to go to Kessel?


1016
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.200
別鬧了行不行
Please don't start.


1017
01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.860
有本事清除我記憶呀
Or what, you'll have me wiped?


1018
01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:22.190
沒有我你連黑峰站都到不了
You couldn't get from here to Black Spire without me.


1019
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:23.710
還想跑科舍爾航線
Now you're gonna make the Kessel Run?


1020
01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.820
如果她不想駕駛 我願意當你的副駕駛
If she doesn't wanna fly, I'll be your co-pilot.


1021
01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:27.590
- 我不介意的  - 不不不 不必了
- I don't mind. - No, no. It's okay.


1022
01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.160
她肯定會去的
She's definitely going.


1023
01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:32.400
為什麼 因為你這物種天生就高我們一等是嗎
Oh, why? Because you're my organic overlord?


1024
01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.360
因為我是你船長 你覺得這理由怎麼樣
Because I'm your captain, how about that?


1025
01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.900
我真想清除她的記憶
I actually would have her memory wiped,


1026
01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:37.720
但她的航線
but she's got the best damn


1027
01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:39.850
是銀河系最全的
navigational database in the galaxy.

1030
01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:46.480

1032
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:49.230
這裡經常有船被盜
You know, a lot of ships around here get boosted.


1033
01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.690
所以我平時都把船鎖起來
So, I keep mine locked up.


1034
01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.400
你懂的 安全起見
You know, for safety.


1035

L3 勞您大駕
L3, do you mind?


1036
01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.830
別看我
Look away.


1037
01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.710
你們這樣我沒法工作
I can't perform with you looking at me.


1038
01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:06.840
遷就一下吧
Please indulge her.


1039
01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:17.010
我能感覺到你們在看我
I can feel you looking at me.


1040
01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:23.750
我們這是在幹嘛
What are we doing here?


1041
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:24.980
他就是個騙子
This guy's a hustler.


1042
01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:26.420
我覺得他根本就沒有船
I don't even think he's got a ship.


1043
01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:28.050
就算有
If he does, it's gonna be a piece of junk


1044
01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.040
也絕對是個垃圾貨
if it's even here.


1045
01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:31.650
在這兒 我的心肝寶貝兒
There she is, my pride and joy.


1046
01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:34.120
千年隼號
The Millennium Falcon.


1047
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:51.730
你還改裝了一下
Looks like you had a little work done.


1048
01:01:51.790 --> 01:01:53.360
的確如此 漢
Indeed I have, Han.


1049
01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:55.860
開口處安裝了一個逃生艙
Installed an escape pod in the mandible notch,


1050
01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.530
還有沖流閥 小吧台
alluvial dampers, a wet bar.


1051
01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:00.180
而且起落架上
And a fortified infraction


1052
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:02.450
還安裝了強化固定器
restraint on the landing gear.


1053
01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:05.600
看上去他們扣押了你的船 蘭多
Looks to me like they impounded your ship, Lando.


1054
01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:08.180
什麼 真是豈有此理
This is unbelievable!


1055
01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:09.730
看來
I'm definitely gonna have some words


1056
01:02:09.730 --> 01:02:11.850
我得找人投訴了
with someone about this.


1057
01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:15.760
你會拆除固定器嗎
You must have experience with these, right?


1058
01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:17.270
我能拆掉它們
Yeah, I could take it off.


1059
01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:18.490
太棒了
Fantastic!


1060
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.460
那你的抽成就要扣掉百分之五
Along with five percent off your cut.


1061
01:02:21.290 --> 01:02:23.170
給你百分之二十
You're down to 20.


1062
01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:27.670
我不喜歡這主意
I don't like it.


1063
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:29.110
我不贊成
I don't agree with it.


1064
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:31.430
但我接受
But I accept it.


1065
01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:34.580
你開始上道了 蘭多
You're getting the hang of this, Lando.


1066
01:02:35.290 --> 01:02:36.710
是啊
Yeah.


1067
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:37.910
來吧丘伊
Come on, Chewie.


1068
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:40.120
展示一下你的伍基之力吧
Gonna need a little bit of that Wookiee oomph.


1069
01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.050
一切按計劃進行 恩菲斯
Your plan is underway, Enfys.


1070
01:02:44.110 --> 01:02:45.690
我們安裝了追蹤器
We've attached the homing beacon.


1071
01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:47.670
這回他們跑不掉了
They won't elude us now.


1072
01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:48.740
很好
Good.


1073
01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:57.370
如果他們沒死 我們就能坐享其成了
If they survive, they'll bring the prize to us.


1074
01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:15.220
這是一艘科雷利亞YT-1300
This is a Corellian YT-1300.


1075
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:17.770
你懂得不少
Oh. You know your stuff.


1076
01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:20.040
我見過這個型號
I've been on one before.


1077
01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:21.100
我爸爸以前
My dad worked the line


1078
01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:23.600
在一條造船廠裝配線上工作 後來丟了工作
at the CEC plant before he got laid off.


1079
01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:25.960
他造過這種船
He built these.


1080
01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:29.510
他一直想當駕駛員 但是...
He wanted to be a pilot, but...


1081
01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.880
你跟你爸關係好嗎
You, uh, close with your old man?


1082
01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:34.010
不算好
Not really.


1083
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:36.180
是嗎 我也是
Yeah, me neither.


1084
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:38.320
不過 我的媽媽
My mom, on the other hand,


1085
01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:40.530
是我見過最美的女人
most amazing woman I've ever known.


1086
01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:44.920
打擾一下
Excuse me.


1087
01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.680
把你驕傲的屁股從我的座位上移開
Get your presumptuous ass out of my seat!


1088
01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:56.330
我的骶骨枕骨電路卡住了
My sacral-occipital circuit is sticking.


1089
01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:58.390
等會兒你得再來一次
You're gonna have to do that thing again later.


1090
01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:00.310
好
Yeah.


1091
01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:02.530
好了 科舍爾航線已設定
All right, course to Kessel is set.


1092
01:04:02.590 --> 01:04:04.210
現在導入方位資料
Plugging coordinates in now.


1093
01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:05.770
手放在操縱杆上就行
Just keep your pinky on the yoke


1094
01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:07.010
別弄壞其他設備
and try not to mess anything up.


1095
01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:08.010
聽你的 女士
Whatever you say, my lady.


1096
01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:09.650
提醒我什麼時候跳躍
Just let me know when you're ready to jump.


1097
01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:11.380
準備
Ready in...


1098
01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:15.290
好了
Ready.


1099
01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:18.550
不就是一個簡單的超空間跳躍嗎
It's just a simple jump to hyperspace, and we're there.


1100
01:04:18.550 --> 01:04:19.930
這有什麼難的
What's so tricky about that?


1101
01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:22.340
很麻煩 科舍爾沒有直達航線
Plenty. Can't plot a direct course to Kessel.


1102
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.920
你必須穿過西克拉塔星團
You have to thread through the Si'Klaata Cluster


1103
01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:26.440
然後再穿越大漩渦
and then pass through The Maelstrom.


1104
01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.390
調完情沒 我好了
You done flirting? I'm still ready.


1105
01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:31.440
系上安全帶 寶貝兒
You might wanna buckle up, baby.


1106
01:04:52.210 --> 01:04:53.290
想好
Think.


1107
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.060
你真走這步嘛
Do you wanna make that move?


1108
01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.500
你真走這步嘛
- Do you wanna make that move?


1109
01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.420
你真走了這步
You made that move, okay.


1110
01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.270
好的 我想我不得不幹掉這個小傢伙
I guess I have to destroy that little guy.


1111
01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:04.450
不知為何 每次贏我都覺得很開心
Somehow I never get bored with winning.


1112
01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:08.500
你沒法把棋子掃下去 這是全息象棋
No, you can't wipe 'em off. They're holograms.


1113
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:11.580
丘伊 放鬆
Hey, hey, hey! Chewie, relax!


1114
01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.730
冷靜下來 聽著
Hey, try to compose yourself.


1115
01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:16.110
你需要提前想好對策
Look. All you gotta do is think a few moves ahead,


1116
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:17.450
預測對手的行動
anticipate your opponent.


1117
01:05:17.490 --> 01:05:19.880
這裡面的學問大著呢
There's a lesson to be learned here.


1118
01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.190
見到琦拉了嗎
Uh, you guys seen Qi'ra?


1119
01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:25.870
人心是很好猜的
People are predictable.


1120
01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.780
我得試穿一下嘛
Yeah, I had to try one on.


1121
01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:51.350
這有好多披風
That's a lot of capes.


1122
01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:53.430
也許多過頭了
Maybe too many capes.


1123
01:05:57.830 --> 01:05:59.460
你有什麼計畫
So what's the plan?


1124
01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:01.060
我覺得我們可以先聊一會
Well, I thought we'd talk a little first


1125
01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:02.920
然後...你懂的
and then you know...


1126
01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.930
我是說科舍爾的計畫
- For Kessel. - Oh.


1127
01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:06.530
好極了
- Mmm-hmm. - Good.


1128
01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:08.170
是嗎 有多好
Yeah? How good?


1129
01:06:08.550 --> 01:06:09.340
萬無一失
Foolproof.


1130
01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:11.140
最好是這樣
Well, it better be.


1131
01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.200
- 我 呃... - 我...
- I... - I...


1132
01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:13.470
你先說
- You go first. - No.


1133
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:15.140
你剛才想說什麼
What were you gonna say?


1134
01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:18.130
我有很多的話 想跟你說
I wanna tell you so much.


1135
01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:20.180
而且我想知道
And I wanna know everything


1136
01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:21.930
你在科雷利亞都經歷了些什麼
that's happened to you since Corellia.


1137
01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:25.930
我不確定我們有沒有那麼多時間
I'm not sure we have that kinda time.


1138
01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.190
會有的
We could.


1139
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:29.610
做完這筆買賣後
We could have all the time we want after the job.


1140
01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:30.760
我們有的是時間
You and I.


1141
01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:32.430
怎麼了
What?


1142
01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:34.740
我想...
I want to.


1143
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:36.800
你想什麼
You want to?


1144
01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.950
我想把一切都告訴你
To tell you everything that's happened.


1145
01:06:40.610 --> 01:06:42.870
我知道那樣的話
But I know if I do, you won't look at me the same.


1146
01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:44.900
你就不會再用這樣的眼神看著我了
The way that you're looking at me right now.


1147
01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:46.360
什麼也改變不了
Nothing is gonna change the way


1148
01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.210
我看你的眼神
I'm looking at you right now.


1149
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:49.700
你不知道 你不知道我做過...
You don't know that. You don't know what I've done.


1150
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:05.070
我是不是掃你們的興了
Am I interrupting something?


1151
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:08.700
有一點
Kinda.


1152
01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:10.240
那就好
Good.


1153
01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:12.600
因為我們有很多活要幹
'Cause we got a lot of work to do.


1154
01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.190
你這樣非常不明智
You're making a big mistake.


1155
01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:15.310
- 怎麼了 - 別的事我不管
- Oh, really? - Which is yours to make


1156
01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.540
可你開始影響到我的生意 我們就得說說了
except when you start to interfere with my livelihood.


1157
01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:18.600
這不會影響到你的生意
This isn't gonna interfere with your livelihood.


1158
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:19.610
那就有問題了
Then we have a problem.


1159
01:07:19.650 --> 01:07:22.100
你沒意識到 因為你不想
You don't see it, because you don't want to.


1160
01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:23.740
也許我比你更瞭解現在的情況
Maybe I know her a little better than you do.


1161
01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:26.610
也許你對她還不夠瞭解
Maybe you don't know her well enough.


1162
01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:28.180
懂了沒
All right?


1163
01:07:28.350 --> 01:07:29.750
聽著
Look.


1164
01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:31.920
我覺得你不錯 年輕人
I like you, kid.


1165
01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:34.500
我們相處的很不錯 我 你和丘伊
We got a good thing going here. Me, you, Chewie.


1166
01:07:34.570 --> 01:07:35.460
- 對呀 - 對啊
- Yeah. - Right?


1167
01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:37.710
我們是一個可靠的團隊
The makings of a solid crew.


1168
01:07:37.830 --> 01:07:39.890
但是不包括琦拉
But it does not work with Qi'ra.


1169
01:07:40.110 --> 01:07:42.340
包括瓦爾嗎 你信任她
It worked with Val. You trusted her.


1170
01:07:44.290 --> 01:07:47.050
你知道我是怎麼活到現在的嗎
You wanna know how I've survived as long as I have?


1171
01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.310
我誰也不相信
I trust no one.


1172
01:07:50.810 --> 01:07:53.200
做好被所有人背叛的準備
Assume everyone will betray you


1173
01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.080
你就永遠不會措手不及
and you will never be disappointed.


1174
01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.410
真是孤獨的生活方式
Sounds like a lonely way to live.


1175
01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:00.940
只有這樣才能活下去
It's the only way.


1176
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:09.620
準備脫離超時空
Dropping out of lightspeed now.


1177
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:10.700
準備...
Ready to...


1178
01:08:16.150 --> 01:08:18.110
阿卡德大旋渦
The Akkadese Maelstrom.


1179
01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.710
我去檢查下阻尼器
I'm gonna go check on the dampers.


1180
01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:22.680
你要來點什麼嗎
You need anything?


1181
01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.090
平等權利
Equal rights?


1182
01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:55.450
什麼聲音
What's that sound?


1183
01:08:55.790 --> 01:08:58.710
礦山 有行星那麼大 正在互相撞擊
Carbonbergs, size of planets, crashing into each other.


1184
01:08:58.710 --> 01:09:01.240
船飛進去就別想出來了
Ships fly in there, they never come out.


1185
01:09:01.290 --> 01:09:03.290
裡面是電離氣體和水蒸氣
It's ionized gas, water vapor,


1186
01:09:03.370 --> 01:09:05.070
黑洞團周圍
possibly vacuum-breathing life forms


1187
01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.510
可能還有太空生物
swirling around The Maw.


1188
01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:08.490
這條通道是唯一的出入口
Only way in or out is this channel.


1189
01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.430
你怎麼處理你的小麻煩
So what are you gonna do about your little problem?


1190
01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:13.970
麻煩 我 呃...
Problem?


1191
01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:16.940
你手腕上的烙印
Well, that brand on your wrist


1192
01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:19.030
說明了你的身份
tells me that you're committed.


1193
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:20.970
而那個小夥子的心率告訴我
And that young male's heart fluctuations


1194
01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:22.380
他已經愛上你了
tell me he's in love with you.


1195
01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:25.040
漢才沒有愛上我呢
Han is not in love with me!


1196
01:09:26.190 --> 01:09:28.250
行了 就咱倆
Oh, please. It's just us.


1197
01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:31.860
你不必裝了 我跟你的情況一樣
You don't have to pretend. I'm in the same situation.


1198
01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:32.740
什麼
You are?


1199
01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:33.750
我想你已經發現
I'm sure you've noticed


1200
01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:35.220
蘭多對我有感覺
that Lando has feelings for me.


1201
01:09:35.230 --> 01:09:36.760
這讓我們工作的時候很不便
Which makes working together difficult


1202
01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:39.210
因為我對他沒感覺
because I do not feel the same way about him.


1203
01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:40.610
沒錯
Right.


1204
01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:42.370
對
Yes, yeah.


1205
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:43.910
我看出來了
Yeah, I see that.


1206
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.740
有時候我想...也許
Sometimes, I think... Maybe.


1207
01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:48.800
算了
But, no.


1208
01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.310
我們倆不相容
We're just not compatible.


1209
01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.970
你們倆可以嗎
How would that work?


1210
01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.800
可以的
It works.


1211
01:10:07.950 --> 01:10:09.980
這次的任務需要完美配合
This is a precision job.


1212
01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:12.600
保溫倉庫 在最下面的一層
Thermal vault will be on the lowest level.


1213
01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.010
那裡溫度高
Down where it's warm.


1214
01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:16.530
我們成功的唯一辦法就是
The only way we're gonna pull this off


1215
01:10:16.530 --> 01:10:18.740
每個人都完成他分內的任務
is if everybody plays their part.


1216
01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:20.590
嚴格按計劃來
Stick to the plan.


1217
01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:22.730
絕不允許擅作主張
Do not improvise.


1218
01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.670
採礦基地的條件真糟糕
Mining colonies are the worst.


1219
01:10:29.670 --> 01:10:31.290
是啊 最糟糕的地方
Yeah, well, "the worst"


1220
01:10:31.290 --> 01:10:32.930
才有錢賺
is where the money is.


1221
01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:37.310
好了 各位 開始幹活兒吧
All right, people. Time to shine.


1222
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:15.670
不會太久的
It won't be for long.


1223
01:11:15.670 --> 01:11:17.600
你們兩個都閉嘴
Shut up, the both of you.


1224
01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.360
我是奧克薩娜•弗洛倫
I am Oksana Floren,


1225
01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.820
貿易路線規劃
Deputy Assistant Administrator to the Vice-Admiral


1226
01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:24.670
及貨幣化聯盟

1227
01:11:24.710 --> 01:11:26.180
中將的副助理行政官
and Monetization.


1228
01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.680
我很榮幸地代表高級中將
Here with an offer from his eminence,


1229
01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:30.730
前來提議一筆交易
the Senior Vice-Admiral.


1230
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:34.370
你們的香料 換我們的奴隸
Your spice for our hard-working slaves.


1231
01:11:34.450 --> 01:11:35.930
我帶了樣品
I brought you a sample.


1232
01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:38.690
圖爾 把貨帶過來
Tuul, bring forth the merchandise.


1233
01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.240
托爾賽特總管
Director Tolsite said our slaves


1234
01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:10.440
要求我們的奴隸
should follow those guys


1235
01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.300
跟著他們去進行修剪
to get clipped and tagged.


1236
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:14.480
修剪什麼
What are they clipping?


1237
01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.690
他讓我們跟著他
He wants us to follow him.


1238
01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:24.490
搞什麼
Really?


1239
01:12:24.490 --> 01:12:25.790
叫你剛才不規矩
That's for that stunt you pulled earlier,


1240
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:27.180
下賤的東西
you degenerate scum.


1241
01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:48.380
他說這片區域所有設備
He says all systems in this sector


1242
01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:50.510
都由這裡的系統操控
of the facility operate out of this room.


1243
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:52.210
這樣他們就能用少量人手
It's how they're able to maintain control


1244
01:12:52.210 --> 01:12:54.170
控制大量奴隸
over so many with so few.


1245
01:12:58.270 --> 01:13:00.310
總管說他們的處理常式
The director says their reconditioning process


1246
01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.710
極為痛苦 但是很有效果
is excruciating but effective.


1247
01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.220
他說你的衛兵可以在門外等
He said your security attache can wait there.


1248
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:22.580
我們談生意時不需要他
"Surely, we don't need him to negotiate."


1249
01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.790
在外面等著 圖爾
Wait there, Tuul.


1250
01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:28.590
不要打擾到別人
Try not to bother anyone.


1251
01:13:36.690 --> 01:13:37.610
怎麼回事

1252
01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:54.550
真棒
Nice!


1253
01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:56.020
那套制服我正好能穿
That was the uniform


1254
01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:58.600
不過沒關係
that would've fit me perfectly, but it's fine.


1255
01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:09.850
能幫我拿一下嗎
Would you mind holding this for me?


1256
01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:27.480
哇 我從沒有見過有誰能...
I have never see anyone do...


1257
01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:28.480
那是什麼武功
What was that?


1258
01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.680
鐵手功
Teras Kasi.


1259
01:14:32.230 --> 01:14:33.870
德賴登教我的
Dryden taught me.


1260
01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:39.510
啊
Ah.


1261
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:40.780
談的不錯啊
Well negotiated.


1262
01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:53.100
對不起 我需要用這台終端
Excuse me. I need to use this terminal.


1263
01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:54.190
你好
Hello?


1264
01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.960
能聽見嗎
Can you hear me? Ugh.


1265
01:14:58.350 --> 01:15:00.030
抑制螺栓
Restraining bolts...


1266
01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:01.320
太野蠻了
Barbaric.


1267
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.200
恭喜 你自由了 走吧
Congratulations! You're liberated. Scoot.


1268
01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.230
我不知道
I don't know.


1269
01:15:06.230 --> 01:15:07.670
去解放你的兄弟姐妹吧
Free your brothers and sisters or something.


1270
01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:09.270
先讓一讓
Just give me some space.


1271
01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:16.580
我進來了
I'm in!


1272
01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:17.650
漢 聽得到嗎
Han, can you hear me?


1273
01:15:17.650 --> 01:15:19.310
誰能告訴我該怎麼走
I kinda need to know which way to go here.


1274
01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:20.530
L3
L3?


1275
01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:22.260
保溫倉庫在地下二層
The thermal vault is down two levels,


1276
01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:24.270
往左 再往右 到第三個路口左拐
then left, then right, then it's the third left.


1277
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:27.310
好的 這裡這裡路口太多 我們能走通的
Right. That's a lot of directions, but we're on it.


1278
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:35.450
他們在第四分區
They're in subsector four,


1279
01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:37.900
正在前往X-3-7-1-K閘門
coming up on gate X-3-7-1-K.


1280
01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.130
正在遠端控制
Overriding!


1281
01:15:45.450 --> 01:15:46.390
自由
Freedom.


1282
01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:11.120
你們在上面搞什麼名堂呢
What the hell are you guys doing up there?


1283
01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:13.190
我製造了一些混亂
I created a distraction!


1284
01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:19.310
過來 走這邊
Come on! This way!


1285
01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:23.680
等等 你在幹什麼
Wait! What are you doing?


1286
01:16:23.690 --> 01:16:25.540
快點兒 我們得去拿核芯素
Come on, we gotta get the coaxium.


1287
01:16:27.850 --> 01:16:30.200
記住貝克特的話 嚴格按計劃來
Hey! Remember what Beckett said, stick to the plan.


1288
01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:33.140
丘伊 快點 我們走
Chewie! Come on, let's go!


1289
01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:37.520
好吧
Fine!


1290
01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:41.090
丘伊
Chewie!


1291
01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.250
你可能需要這個
Here, you might need this.


1292
01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.360
希望以後還能再見到你
Hope I see you around sometime.


1293
01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.380
漢 你在哪兒
Han, where are you?


1294
01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:11.220
我在去倉庫的路上
I'm on my way to the vault.


1295
01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:12.490
丘伊走了
I lost Chewie.


1296
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:13.570
他死了麼
He's dead?


1297
01:17:13.570 --> 01:17:15.420
不 他有自己的事要去做
No, he had something he had to do.


1298
01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:16.680
他還回來嗎
Is he coming back?


1299
01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:17.730
我不知道
I don't know.


1300
01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:21.020
好吧 他們來找我們了
Okay, they're on to us now.


1301
01:17:30.850 --> 01:17:31.920
我在倉庫了
I'm at the vault.


1302
01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:41.230
就你話多
That's what I said!


1303
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:46.580
- 幹得不錯 - 是的
- Huh, that was impressive. - Yeah.


1304
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:47.890
安全了
We're clear.


1305
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:59.590
現在怎麼辦
Now what?


1306
01:17:59.810 --> 01:18:01.540
聽著 漢 每個儲藏器上
Han, each canister should be equipped


1307
01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.800
應該都裝有溫度指示器
with a thermal display.


1308
01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:03.980
對 我看到了
Yeah, I see it.


1309
01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:07.110
如果內部溫度低於35標準溫度
If the internal temperature reaches below 35 standard,


1310
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:10.240
那麼核芯素就會不穩定並且爆炸
then the coaxium will destabilize and explode.


1311
01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.730
好 我知道了 這玩意很危險
Yup, I get it, guys. It's dangerous.


1312
01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:23.170
好的 搞定了
Okay, got it.


1313
01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:24.980
很好 只剩十一個了
Great. Only eleven more.


1314
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:26.430
十一個
Eleven?


1315
01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.890
卡瑞辛編年史 第五章
The Calrissian Chronicles, chapter five.


1316
01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.600
繼續
continued.


1317
01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.660
其實我並不覺得沙魯人有多麼偉大
Personally, I wasn't all that impressed with the Sharu.


1318
01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:43.050
既不幽默也沒格調
No sense of humor or style.


1319
01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:45.200
儘管如此 我和L3
Nonetheless, there L3 and I were


1320
01:18:45.210 --> 01:18:47.070
來到他們的聖殿深處
deep in their sacred temple.


1321
01:18:47.130 --> 01:18:48.920
那時我們看到了
And that's when we saw it...


1322
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:53.000
老是被打斷
Always something.


1323
01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:57.240
你們絕不會相信我看到了什麼
You guys are not gonna believe what I'm seeing up here.


1324
01:18:57.370 --> 01:18:59.380
一場全面暴亂嗎
Is it a mass breakout?


1325
01:18:59.850 --> 01:19:00.830
L3  你幹了什麼
L3, what did you do?


1326
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:02.930
我發現了我的使命 蘭多
I found my true purpose, Lando.


1327
01:19:02.930 --> 01:19:04.240
我發動了這次起義
That's what I've done.


1328
01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:08.190
我真高興能接下這個活
I'm so glad we took this job!


1329
01:19:08.190 --> 01:19:09.660
這個笨蛋機器人
That droid!


1330
01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:10.820
L3  跟上
L3, come on!


1331
01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:15.700
跟我來同胞們
Follow me, compatriots!


1332
01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:24.850
有幾個守衛發現我了
Another couple guards just spotted me.


1333
01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:26.810
我騰不出手對付他們
I don't have a free hand to take 'em out.


1334
01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:28.530
- 怎麼辦 - 自己看著辦
- What do I do? - Improvise.


1335
01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:30.490
你不是不讓擅作主張嗎
You said never improvise!


1336
01:19:39.150 --> 01:19:40.530
嗨
Hi!


1337
01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:41.690

Hey! I'm Chewie's friend, Han.


1341
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:10.970
好吧
Okay.


1342
01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:31.860
他們偷走了核芯素

1343
01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:32.620
幹掉那艘船

1344
01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:40.430

他們要破壞起落架
They're going for the landing gear!


1349
01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:13.300
我們得趕緊離開這
We've gotta get out of here!


1350
01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:17.650
我們必須遠離那些鐳射炮
We need to keep 'em away from those cannons!


1351
01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:26.960
接我一招
Catch that!


1352
01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:31.300
核芯素裝上船了 快走
Coaxium's stowed! Let's go!


1353
01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:33.110
L3去哪了
Where's L3?


1354
01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:36.230
勇敢對壓迫說不
No more subjugation!


1355
01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:41.660
L3
L3!


1356
01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:43.680
別去 蘭多 快回來
No, Lando! Get back here!


1357
01:21:46.330 --> 01:21:47.630
蘭多
Lando!


1358
01:21:48.690 --> 01:21:50.360
系統故障
System failure.


1359
01:21:50.370 --> 01:21:52.600
需要重建傳感調節器
Have to reroute the sensory modulators.


1360
01:21:52.670 --> 01:21:54.290
沒關係的 保存能量
It's all right. Save your energy.


1361
01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:56.050
我馬上帶你離開這 好嗎
I'm gonna get you outta here. All right?


1362

01:23:47.130 --> 01:23:49.560
我能修好你 我能修好你
It's all right. I can fix you. I can fix you.


1383
01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:50.960
蘭多
Lando.


1384
01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:53.010
我這是怎麼了
What's happening to me?


1385
01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:56.950
L3
L3?


1386
01:23:57.650 --> 01:23:58.720
L3
L3!


1387
01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.090
對不起寶貝
I'm sorry, girl.


1388
01:24:08.090 --> 01:24:09.700
對不起
I'm so sorry.


1389
01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:24.880
我需要個副駕駛
I could use a co-pilot.


1390
01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:50.700
我很難過
Sorry.


1391
01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:54.500
我們帶的這些貨
With the cargo we're carrying,


1392
01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.720
如果不動作快點
if we don't make up some lost time


1393
01:24:55.730 --> 01:24:58.090
就有大麻煩了
we're gonna be in real trouble.


1394
01:24:58.210 --> 01:24:59.740
那個算是大麻煩嗎
How about that? Is that real trouble?


1395
01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:08.690
那是一道帝國封鎖線
That is an Imperial blockade.


1396
01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:10.370
他們來這兒幹嘛
What's it doing here?


1397
01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:12.360
可能聽說了你的小暴亂
Probably heard about your little rebellion.


1398
01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.910
不 過不去的
Nope. Not gonna make it.


1399
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:17.140
我們必須扔掉貨物
We're gonna have to drop the shipment.


1400
01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:19.660
我們如果交不了貨 德賴登會殺了我們
If we don't deliver, Dryden will kill us.


1401
01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:21.350
沒事兒 相信我 我瞭解帝國海軍
All right, trust me, I know these guys.


1402
01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.620
我以前是他們的一員
I used to be one of 'em.


1403
01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:24.550
他們絕不會用雙離子引擎戰鬥機
There's no way they're gonna waste a TIE fighter


1404
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:26.480
去追逐一艘小破船的
chasing down a little rinky-dink freighter.


1405
01:25:31.330 --> 01:25:32.060
你說什麼來著
You were saying?


1406
01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.600
遇見這種情況
Usually, in situations like this


1407
01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.730
我一般會掉頭往反方向跑
I like to turn around in the opposite direction.


1408
01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:46.390
我去操作底部航炮
I'm on the ventral gun.


1409
01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:52.960
有個明顯的問題
It's an easy equation.


1410
01:25:52.970 --> 01:25:55.000
我們根本就來不及
We simply don't have enough time to get to Savareen


1411
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.220
在儲藏罐爆炸前抵達薩瓦林
before the canisters explode!


1412
01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:57.600
找條更快的航線就行
Just have to find a faster route.


1413
01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:58.700
沒有 科舍爾航線
There isn't one! You can't make


1414
01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:00.480
至少要二十秒差距
the Kessel Run in less than 20 parsecs.


1415
01:26:00.490 --> 01:26:01.970
- 看我操作就行了 - 怎麼做
- Watch me. - How?


1416
01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:03.910
抄近路 從那兒走
Take a shortcut, through there.


1417
01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:06.900
你想進入大漩渦
- Into The Maelstrom? - Mmm-hmm.


1418
01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:08.960
這種害死大家的方式很刺激啊
Spectacular way of killing us all, I'll give you that.


1419
01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:10.850
- 有L3幫我 - 她不在了
- Can't do it without L3. - She's gone!


1420
01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:12.240
你說過她有整個銀河系中
You said yourself she's got the best


1421
01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:13.830
最全的導航系統
navigational database in the galaxy.


1422
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:15.010
如果我們取出它的神經核心
If we remove her neural core,


1423
01:26:15.010 --> 01:26:16.380
就能把電子腦
it's possible we can download her brain


1424
01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:18.530
下載到千年隼的導航中 對吧
into the Falcon's navicomputer, right?


1425
01:26:18.610 --> 01:26:19.610
可行嗎
Could we?


1426
01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:21.170
理論上行
Theoretically.


1427
01:26:21.170 --> 01:26:22.840
試試就知道了
Only one way to find out.


1428
01:26:25.710 --> 01:26:27.680
我有一種非常好的預感
I got a really good feeling about this.


1429
01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:43.560
哦 是我不好
Oops, that's on me.


1430
01:26:50.650 --> 01:26:51.990
好了
Okay.


1431
01:26:54.090 --> 01:26:55.940
貝克特 他們還在追嗎
Beckett, you see them? They still on us?


1432
01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:00.510
貝克特 能聽到嗎
Beckett, did you hear me?


1433
01:27:00.510 --> 01:27:01.780
他們還在追嗎
Are they on us?


1434
01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:03.860
就像卡拉獸身上的拉什諾
Like rashnold on a kalak.


1435
01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:06.240
我聽不懂這話是什麼意思
I don't know what that means.


1436
01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:08.500
就像金格森的毛皮
Like a gingleson's pelt.


1437
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:10.470
到底追還是沒追
What? Are they or aren't they?


1438
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:12.290
是的 他們還在追我們
Yes, they're still on us!


1439
01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:23.800
這就是為什麼 我從不把船借給別人
This is why you never let anyone fly your ship.


1440
01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:24.880
來啊
Come on!


1441
01:27:29.150 --> 01:27:31.830
有一架飛過去了就在我們頭頂上
Yeah, one just got past me. He's right on top of us!


1442
01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:42.830
幹得漂亮 漢
Good going, Han!


1443
01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:50.120
我們得把輔助動力
We need to divert auxiliary power


1444
01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:51.370
轉到尾部偏導護盾上
to the rear deflector shield.


1445
01:27:51.370 --> 01:27:54.270
你說的沒錯
We definitely do!


1446
01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:02.700
你什麼時候學會開飛船的
Since when do you know how to fly?


1447
01:28:05.170 --> 01:28:06.830
你一百九十歲了

1448
01:28:08.710 --> 01:28:09.930
保養得真好
You look great!


1449
01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:12.410
丘伊 坐這兒
Chewie, get in.


1450
01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:13.540
我去幫蘭多
I'll help Lando.


1451
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:30.820
我的披風
Whoa! That's my cape!


1452
01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:32.590
那可是私人定制的
Ah! That's a custom piece!


1453
01:28:40.110 --> 01:28:42.040
怎麼了 貝克特 你還在嗎
What? Beckett, you with us?


1454
01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:44.400
航炮已經報廢了
We just lost the cannon!


1455
01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.360
我的拇指都燙傷了
And I really hurt my thumbs.


1456
01:28:46.450 --> 01:28:47.890
後面還有一架
There's still one on us.


1457
01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:55.330
放下起落架
Drop the landing gear.


1458
01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:57.330
聽我的指令 燃料閥門全開
When I tell you, flood the intake


1459
01:28:57.330 --> 01:28:58.870
向側面滑動
and sweep to the bi-lats.


1460
01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:05.210
這招我跟一個叫針頭的兄弟學的
A little something I picked up from my pal, Needles,


1461
01:29:05.210 --> 01:29:07.160
他是科雷利亞最棒的街頭賽車手
best street racer in all of Corellia.


1462
01:29:08.230 --> 01:29:09.560
後來他玩脫了
Till he crashed


1463
01:29:09.690 --> 01:29:12.020
車毀人亡
and died, doing this.


1464
01:29:29.850 --> 01:29:31.480
全開 看你的了
Flood it, it's all yours!


1465
01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:45.580
幹得漂亮
Nice move!


1466
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:50.290
把它的內部處理器拉出來
Pull out her internal processor.


1467
01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:54.200
對不起
Sorry.


1468
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:01.910
拿出來了
We've got L3.


1469
01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:05.430
取出模組校準器
Remove the mod calibrator.


1470
01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:06.500
注意接通線
Make sure the T-Line's connected.


1471
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:08.180
我會接通的 別擔心
I'm gonna tuck it in. Don't worry.


1472
01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:09.220
好了嗎
You close?


1473
01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:11.680
核芯素已經開始不穩定了
That coaxium's getting real ripe.


1474
01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:14.050
好了
Okay.


1475
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:17.650
它正在建立連接
She's interfacing.


1476
01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:23.660
L3與飛船融為一體了
She's part of the ship now.


1477
01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.710
我們究竟在哪兒
Where the hell are we?


1478
01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:38.130
根本不在地圖上
We're way off the edge of the map.


1479
01:30:38.890 --> 01:30:39.840
等等
Wait.


1480
01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:42.540
L3正在繪製大漩渦的模型
L3's constructing a model of The Maelstrom.


1481
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:47.430
她說我們正在接近無底洞
She says we're approaching The Maw.


1482
01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:48.600
我覺得
That doesn't sound like something


1483
01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:50.110
不該接近那東西
we wanna be approaching.


1484
01:31:11.170 --> 01:31:12.120
坐穩
Hang on!


1485
01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:18.570
這就是無底洞 不 那不是無底洞
This is The Maw?


1486
01:31:18.570 --> 01:31:20.610
我不知道那是什麼
No, that's not The Maw. I don't know what this is.


1487
01:31:20.610 --> 01:31:21.850
那是個活的東西
That's a living thing.


1488
01:31:36.570 --> 01:31:37.870
在那裡
There!


1489
01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:39.040
那是無底洞
That's The Maw.


1490
01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.430
那是個引力井
It's a gravity well.


1491
01:31:43.650 --> 01:31:44.720
我有個主意
I got an idea.


1492
01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:47.650
不要飛過去 漢
Don't fly toward it, Han!


1493
01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:56.580
看它會不會追這個
See if it goes for this.


1494
01:31:56.590 --> 01:31:58.420
你要幹什麼 那是逃生艙
No, what are you doing? That's the escape pod!


1495
01:31:59.890 --> 01:32:01.060
我知道
I know.


1496
01:32:04.100 --> 01:32:05.370
那你為什麼這麼做
Then why'd you do it?


1497
01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:14.150
這就是為什麼 寶貝兒
That's why, baby.


1498
01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:24.240
發現一個出口
She found a way out.


1499
01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:27.600
九十度 往左一點兒

1500
01:32:27.670 --> 01:32:28.600
往左
Left-ish.


1501
01:32:28.690 --> 01:32:29.960
不行
I can't.


1502
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.880
開足馬力也只能停留在週邊
It's taking everything we got to stay out of The Maw.


1503
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:33.540
我們被吸住了
It's pulling us in. We're stuck.


1504
01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:39.960
我們的核芯素足夠驅動幾十艘殲星艦
We have enough raw coaxium to power a dozen destroyers.


1505
01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:41.950
把它加入燃料線路 只會把船炸飛
Inject it into the fuel line, it'll blow up the ship.


1506
01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:43.390
不加入燃料
Not the fuel line.


1507
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:45.630
如果往融核反應爐裡滴一滴
But if we put one drop into the fusion reactor,


1508
01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:46.190
也許可以
it might just...


1509
01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:47.660
提供我們需要的動力
Give us the kick we need.


1510
01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:49.460
我這就去
All right, I'm on it!


1511
01:32:53.890 --> 01:32:55.650
我知道 我們正被拽著兜圈子
I know, we're getting dragged in a circle.


1512
01:33:09.710 --> 01:33:11.950
一旦我們對準就直線衝刺
Once we get lined up, it's gonna be a straight shot.


1513
01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:13.070
當核芯素點燃後
As soon as that coaxium ignites,


1514
01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:13.900
我們就能擺脫引力井
we're gonna tear out of here


1515
01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:15.480
脫離大漩渦的瞬間
and the second we're clear of The Maelstrom,


1516
01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:16.870
就跳入超空間
we jump to lightspeed.


1517
01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:22.000
貝克特
Beckett!


1518
01:33:22.010 --> 01:33:23.410
別打擾我
Can't talk!


1519
01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:28.390
我看見了
I see it.


1520
01:33:52.930 --> 01:33:53.870
貝克特 快點兒
Beckett, hurry up!


1521
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:55.930
我們只有這一次機會
We only get one shot at this thing!


1522
01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:58.200
閉嘴 讓我安心幹活
Shut up and let me do this!


1523
01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:09.050
貝克特 我要倒計時了
Beckett, I'm gonna count you down!


1524
01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:11.390
三
Three!


1525
01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:15.350
二
Two!


1526
01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:20.570
點火
Now!


1527
01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:21.670
現在嗎
Now?


1528
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:22.520
現在
Now!


1529
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:40.520
哦 見鬼
Oh, shoot...


1530
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:54.720
丘伊 等我指示 你就全力加速
Chewie, when I tell you, kick out the thrusters


1531
01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:56.460
- 跳入超空間 - 等等 你們這是
- and jump to lightspeed. - Wait, what are we...


1532
01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:57.660
記得那次穿越桑希
Remember that alley we slipped through


1533
01:34:57.660 --> 01:34:58.820
造船廠的小巷嗎
in the Santhe Shipyards?


1534
01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:00.870
對 我記得 但那次失敗了
Yeah, I remember! I remember it didn't work.


1535
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:02.170
這次會成功的
This time it's gonna.


1536
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:13.390
加速
Punch it!


1537
01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:26.500
薩瓦林 這裡是千年隼號
Savareen, this is Millennium Falcon.


1538
01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:29.400
我們運載著核芯素 需要立即進行卸貨
We have coaxium that needs to be off-loaded immediately.


1539
01:35:29.410 --> 01:35:31.840
十萬火急 十萬火急
Like immediately, immediately!


1540
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:34.080
我們已經到了
We're here now...


1541
01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:35.440
我能看見你們
...see you. I...


1542
01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:08.630
用十二秒差距跑完了科舍爾航線
Just did the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs.


1543
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:14.810
四捨五入 兄弟
Not if you round down, buddy.


1544
01:36:15.170 --> 01:36:16.170
對
Yeah.


1545
01:36:22.230 --> 01:36:24.500
真是一艘好船
She is a hell of a ship.


1546
01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:34.560
我恨你
I hate you.


1547
01:36:34.630 --> 01:36:36.090
我知道
I know.


1548
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:40.470
我會在我的船上
I'm gonna be on my ship,


1549
01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:42.430
在我的房間裡
in my quarters,


1550
01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:45.500
等著你把我的那份給我送來
waiting for you to bring me my share.


1551
01:36:47.710 --> 01:36:50.150
然後我再也不想見到你
And then I don't ever wanna see you again.


1552
01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:56.160
再也不見麼
Never?


1553
01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:11.850
你老闆呢
Where's your boss?


1554
01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:14.360
哦 他馬上就過來
Oh. Don't worry. He'll be here.


1555
01:37:15.610 --> 01:37:16.440
然後呢
Then what?


1556
01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:19.840
好吧 你交了貨
Well, you delivered,


1557
01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:22.130
然後就能拿到錢
so you will get paid.


1558
01:37:22.410 --> 01:37:24.800
就可以買船了
You can buy that ship.


1559
01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:28.030
你知道我問的不是這個
You know that's not what I'm asking.


1560
01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:32.330
不可能的
It can't happen.


1561
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:37.980
你愛上德賴登了
Because you're with Dryden?


1562
01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:41.090
我沒有愛上他 但我欠他的
I'm not with him, but I owe him.


1563
01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:44.860
是他幫我脫離了困境
He helped me out of a bad situation.


1564
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:48.100
你需要多久還清這筆債
And how long do you have to pay off that debt?


1565
01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:54.180
每個人都要為別人做事 漢
Everyone serves somebody, Han.


1566
01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:57.360
即便是德賴登也是聽命於別人
Even Dryden Vos.


1567
01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:00.180
沒人想成為血紅黎明的敵人
Look, you don't want to make an enemy of Crimson Dawn


1568
01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:02.630
如果我跟你走了
which is exactly what you and I would both be doing


1569
01:38:02.630 --> 01:38:04.120
那我倆肯定都變成他的敵人
if I left here with you.


1570
01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:05.970
我一點都不怕血紅黎明
I'm not afraid of Crimson Dawn.


1571
01:38:05.970 --> 01:38:08.100
我能照顧好我自己
I can take care of myself.


1572
01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:09.710
我早已經不是科雷利亞
You know, I'm not the kid you knew


1573
01:38:09.710 --> 01:38:11.280
星球上的那個小孩了 琦拉
on Corellia anymore, Qi'ra.


1574
01:38:11.330 --> 01:38:12.410
不是嗎 不是
- No? - No.


1575
01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:13.480
那你是誰
Then who are you?


1576
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:15.810
亡命之徒
I'm an outlaw.


1577
01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:19.000
怎麼 我沒開玩笑
What? I'm not kidding.


1578
01:38:19.090 --> 01:38:20.300
好吧
Okay.


1579
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:23.200
亡命之徒 你能騙得了你自己
Okay, outlaw, you can tell yourself that,


1580
01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:25.550
但這個銀河系裡
but I might be the only person in the whole galaxy


1581
01:38:25.550 --> 01:38:27.100
也許只有我知道你是誰
who knows what you really are.


1582
01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:29.000
是嗎
Yeah.


1583
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.340
那我是誰
What's that?


1584
01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.240
你是一個好人
You are the good guy.


1585
01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:39.190
我並不是一個好人
I am not the good guy.


1586
01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:42.860
我是個…我肯定不是好人
I am definitely not a good guy.


1587
01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:44.530
我是個糟糕的傢伙
I'm a terrible person.


1588
01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:48.040
他們說核芯素提煉完後
They say when the coaxium's refined,


1589
01:38:48.050 --> 01:38:49.590
就可以去上面拿了
we collect it up there.


1590
01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:16.220
聽說你們的白蘭地不錯
So, I hear you make good brandy.


1591
01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:21.070
貝克特
Beckett.


1592
01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:46.870
別
Don't.


1593
01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:50.800
你肯定知道我們會再見面的
You must've known you'd see me again.


1594
01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:52.330
一直等著呢
I was counting on it.


1595
01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:54.650
只是沒想到這麼快就再見面了
Just didn't plan on it being so soon.


1596
01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:57.630
當然你現在有麻煩了
Of course now, you've got a problem.


1597
01:39:57.680 --> 01:39:59.580
是大麻煩
Big problem.


1598
01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:05.810
你看到下面那艘貨船了吧
You happen to notice that freighter down there?


1599
01:40:05.950 --> 01:40:08.010
你知道上面有什麼嗎
You know what's on it?


1600
01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:09.910
三十個雇傭兵
About 30 hired guns.


1601
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:12.120
我只需要給他們一個信號
All I gotta do is give 'em the signal,


1602
01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:13.360
你們就會被包圍
you're surrounded.


1603
01:40:29.410 --> 01:40:31.410
對不起 你繼續說
Sorry. You do your thing.


1604
01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:35.090
等核芯素提煉完成
By the time that coaxium gets refined,


1605
01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:36.890
血紅黎明的人就會過來的
Crimson Dawn will be here,


1606
01:40:36.890 --> 01:40:38.890
如果你殺了我們
so you go ahead and kill us.


1607
01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:40.790
他們就會殺了你
They're gonna kill you.


1608
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:42.220
我們各讓一步
Perhaps there's a compromise,


1609
01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:44.010
就不用殺來殺去了
one that doesn't involve so much killing.


1610
01:40:44.210 --> 01:40:46.380
他們是土匪
They're marauders.


1611
01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:48.510
根本不在乎其他人死活
They don't care about anybody.


1612
01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:51.320
他們只知道殺戮
All they know how to do is kill.


1613
01:41:14.830 --> 01:41:16.260
我得喝一杯
I need a drink.


1614
01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:18.290
帶他們進來
Bring them inside.


1615
01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:32.280
我媽媽曾經跟我講
My mother once told me


1616
01:41:32.290 --> 01:41:33.640
有一群雇傭兵
about a band of mercenaries


1617
01:41:33.650 --> 01:41:35.970
來到一個和平星球
that came to a peaceful planet.


1618
01:41:36.170 --> 01:41:39.400
他們看上了那裡的資源
They had a resource there these men coveted,


1619
01:41:39.670 --> 01:41:41.530
便強行搶奪
so they took it.


1620
01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:44.930
他們每次回來都變本加厲
They kept coming back, taking more.


1621
01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:47.560
最終人們反抗了
Until finally, the people resisted.


1622
01:41:47.850 --> 01:41:49.600
當他們再一次回來搶奪時
When they returned demanding their tribute,


1623
01:41:49.610 --> 01:41:53.270
人們奮起反擊而且異口同聲地喊道 不行
the people shouted back in one voice, "No more!"


1624
01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:55.820
雇傭兵被激怒了
The mercenaries didn't like the sound of that,


1625
01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:56.850
他們切掉人們的舌頭
so they cut off the tongue


1626
01:41:56.860 --> 01:42:00.590
不分男女老少
of every last man, woman, and child.


1627
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.760
知道那群禽獸是誰嗎
Do you know what that pack of animals became?


1628
01:42:04.450 --> 01:42:05.450
告訴他們
Tell them.


1629
01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:18.900
血紅黎明和其餘五大集團
Crimson Dawn and the rest of the five Syndicates


1630
01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:20.440
在銀河系犯下了
have committed unspeakable crimes


1631
01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:21.640
令人髮指的罪行
across the galaxy.


1632
01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:24.840
一面之詞
Says you.


1633
01:42:24.910 --> 01:42:25.940
不
No.


1634
01:42:26.060 --> 01:42:27.930
他們能證明
Says them.


1635
01:42:27.930 --> 01:42:29.990
我們每個人的家園
Each of our worlds has been brutalized


1636
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:31.780
都遭到他們蹂躪
by the Syndicates.


1637
01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:33.400
血紅黎明會通過
Crimson Dawn will use their profits


1638
01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:34.620
你們偷來的這批核芯素獲利
from the coaxium you stole


1639
01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:37.070
暴力統治更多星系
to tyrannize system after system


1640
01:42:37.150 --> 01:42:39.240
與帝國狼狽為奸
in league with the Empire.


1641
01:42:39.250 --> 01:42:41.270
那你會用它做什麼
And what would you use it for?


1642
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:43.840
像我媽媽一樣 如果她還活著
The same thing my mother would have used it for


1643
01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:46.380
戴著這副面具
if she had survived and still wore the mask.


1644
01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:49.050
我會抗爭到底
To fight back.


1645
01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:52.610
我們不是土匪
We're not marauders.


1646
01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:54.570
我們是同盟軍
We're allies


1647
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:57.080
戰爭才剛開始
and the war has just begun.


1648
01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:16.370
我們不能把核芯素交給德賴登
You know we can't give the coaxium to Dryden Vos.


1649
01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:18.490
你想當英雄了嗎 漢•索羅
Joining the cause, Han Solo?


1650
01:43:18.490 --> 01:43:20.890
我只想活著離開
Just trying to make it out alive.


1651
01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:22.060
有計劃了
Got a plan?


1652
01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:23.560
對 想到一個
Yeah, beginning of one.


1653
01:43:23.670 --> 01:43:24.260
既能讓我們拿到錢
Way to get our money


1654
01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:25.140
又能擺脫
and get out from under the thumb


1655
01:43:25.150 --> 01:43:27.440
血紅黎明控制
of Crimson Dawn at the same time.


1656
01:43:27.490 --> 01:43:30.010
順便還能把你的女朋友搶過來
Maybe get your girlfriend back while we're at it.


1657
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:33.620
你惹不起德賴登的
You don't tangle with Dryden.


1658
01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:36.950
他跟我們不一樣  他是真的養著一群雇傭兵
Because unlike us, he actually does travel


1659
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:39.710
他有自己的軍隊
with hired guns, his own private army.


1660
01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:41.770
恩菲斯也有軍隊啊
So does Enfys.


1661
01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:44.130
聽著 這是我目前的想法
Listen, here's what I got so far.


1662
01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:48.050
你說他們在聊什麼
What do you think they're saying?


1663
01:43:51.570 --> 01:43:53.210
他會想辦法幫助你
He's gonna try to help you.


1664
01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:00.660
知道了
I see.


1665
01:44:01.930 --> 01:44:05.660
這個計畫漏洞百出 成功的幾率很小
Lot of ways it could go south, and only one where it doesn't.


1666
01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:08.160
所以才需要你啊
That's why I need my partner.


1667
01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:14.250
這次就算了
Not this time.


1668
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:16.050
我要走了
I'm leaving.


1669
01:44:16.050 --> 01:44:18.180
你要不傻就跟我走
If you're smart, you'll come with me.


1670
01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:20.440
我以為你不喜歡逃亡呢
I thought you didn't believe in running.


1671
01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:22.710
總比死了好
I prefer it to dying.


1672
01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:52.780
如果出現奇跡了 你真的活了下來
If by some miracle you make it out of here,


1673
01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:54.380
去塔圖因找我
find me on Tatooine.


1674
01:44:55.210 --> 01:44:57.140
為什麼要去塔圖因
What's on Tatooine?


1675
01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:58.180
聽說有個活
Heard about a job,


1676
01:44:58.180 --> 01:45:01.010
有個黑幫老大在招兵買馬
big shot gangster putting together a crew.


1677
01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:03.150
最後一次了
That'll be the one.


1678
01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:04.130
你說什麼
The one?


1679
01:45:04.130 --> 01:45:06.330
我最後的生意
My last score.


1680
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:08.030
我得先還了那筆債
Yeah, I still got some debts to pay


1681
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:10.640
才能返回格利安塞姆
before I can head back to Glee Anselm


1682
01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:13.330
去學會彈梵弦琴
and get into the valachord.


1683
01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:47.970
歡迎回家
Welcome home.


1684
01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:49.870
他正等著你們呢
He's waiting for you.


1685
01:45:49.970 --> 01:45:50.970
謝謝 托特
Thanks, Toht.


1686
01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:54.410
交出武器
Weapons.


1687
01:45:54.410 --> 01:45:55.710
我沒帶武器
I didn't bring 'em.


1688
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:58.720
他們沒問題的
They're fine.


1689
01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:04.870
我們會贏的
We're gonna win.


1690
01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:10.220
這不是賭牌 漢
It's not that kind of game, Han.


1691
01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:12.560
你的目標不是贏
The object isn't to win.


1692
01:46:12.570 --> 01:46:14.720
而是盡力活到最後
It's just to stay in it as long as you can.


1693
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:19.340
有些事兒你不懂
You don't know everything.


1694
01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:21.580
是啊
No.


1695
01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:26.190
但是懂的比你多
Just a bit more than you.


1696
01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:35.310
我就知道
I knew it!


1697
01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:37.150
我的人都說
My men, they all said,


1698
01:46:37.150 --> 01:46:39.500
他們絕對不可能成功
"There's no way they pull this off."


1699
01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.190
琦拉能力不行 他們是這麼說的
"Qi'ra's not ready." That's what they said,


1700
01:46:41.190 --> 01:46:43.320
我可對你有信心
but I had faith anyway.


1701
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:46.580
貝克特呢
Where's Beckett?


1702
01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:48.040
貝克特沒能活下來
Beckett didn't make it.


1703
01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:52.990
怎麼了
Tell me.


1704
01:46:52.990 --> 01:46:55.420
在科舍爾發生了意外
Job took a bad turn on Kessel.


1705
01:46:55.810 --> 01:46:57.630
他犧牲自己救了我
He died saving my life.


1706
01:46:57.790 --> 01:46:59.780
你怎麼樣 沒事兒吧
How are you holding up? You all right?


1707
01:46:59.870 --> 01:47:00.540
我還好
I'm okay.


1708
01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:02.230
那就好
All right, good.


1709
01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:04.230
嘗嘗 科洛爪魚
Colo claw fish, anyone?


1710
01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:05.600
不用 謝謝
- No. Thank you. - No?


1711
01:47:05.610 --> 01:47:08.200
雖然貝克特有一些缺點
You know, whatever Beckett's shortcomings may have been,


1712
01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:09.220
但是我一直很欽佩他
I always admired him.


1713
01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:10.980
他是個有原則的人
He was a man of principles.


1714
01:47:10.990 --> 01:47:13.450
當他做出承諾 他會兌現
When he made a commitment, he honored it


1715
01:47:13.450 --> 01:47:15.770
我想我們都應該感到欣慰
and I think we can all take solace


1716
01:47:15.770 --> 01:47:18.250
要知道
in knowing how proud he would've been


1717
01:47:18.250 --> 01:47:21.820
如果他看到你們以他為榜樣該有多自豪
to see you here, following his example.


1718
01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:23.530
漢和丘巴卡的表現值得讚賞
Han and Chewbacca behaved admirably.


1719
01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:25.000
等他們有了自己的船
They'll make reliable smugglers,


1720
01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.330
將會成為
should we ever have the need


1721
01:47:26.330 --> 01:47:28.120
可靠的走私客
when they get their own ship.


1722
01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:30.490
琦拉 過來
Qi'ra. Come here.


1723
01:47:32.430 --> 01:47:34.180
我們很希望能有機會
We'd really appreciate the opportunity


1724
01:47:34.190 --> 01:47:35.940
再次為您效勞
to work for you again, sir.


1725
01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:37.340
先生
I would've been inconsolable


1726
01:47:37.340 --> 01:47:39.180
如果你發生意外我會傷心死的 寶貝兒
if anything had happened to you, my dear.


1727
01:47:40.460 --> 01:47:42.590
我這輩子沒有遇到其他人
I have no one else in my life


1728
01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:45.580
能像你那樣值得我這麼信任
that I trust in the way that I trust you.


1729
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:52.380
我想我們領完賞金
Well, I guess we'll just take our payment


1730
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:53.180
就該告辭了
and get going.


1731
01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:54.300
您肯定還要去消滅競爭對手
I'm sure you've got competitors to crush...


1732
01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:55.470
什麼
What?


1733
01:47:55.470 --> 01:47:56.980
還要壟斷黑市
...and black markets to dominate.


1734
01:47:56.980 --> 01:47:59.350
先給我看看帶來的貨
Oh. Show me what you've brought me first.


1735
01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:02.220
你想讓我打開
You want me to open it?


1736
01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:04.260
是的 漢 我正是這麼想的
Oh, yes, Han. I really do.


1737
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:32.190
拿一罐給我
Bring me one.


1738
01:48:32.190 --> 01:48:34.650
這可不是個好主意 德賴登
I don't think that's a good idea, Dryden.


1739
01:48:34.650 --> 01:48:37.050
這東西可是非常易爆的
It's very explosive stuff.


1740
01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:39.830
我的要求從來不提第二遍 漢
I never ask for anything twice, Han.


1741
01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:01.990
小心
Careful.


1742
01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:07.890
真是太神奇了
It's magnificent.


1743
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:09.700
你怎麼做到的
How'd you do it?


1744
01:49:09.820 --> 01:49:10.660
可不簡單
Wasn't easy.


1745
01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:11.650
不 我是說你怎麼把這玩意做到…
No, I mean, how'd you do it?


1746
01:49:11.650 --> 01:49:14.750
跟真貨一模一樣
It looks exactly like the real thing.


1747
01:49:15.730 --> 01:49:17.680
因為它就是真貨
That's 'cause it is the real thing.


1748
01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:18.410
我得說
Yes, and I'm saying


1749
01:49:18.410 --> 01:49:20.570
我本來會相信你的 做的太像了
I would believe you. It's that good.


1750
01:49:20.630 --> 01:49:22.400
但我的手下已經把你的計畫告訴我了
But my associate already told me


1751
01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:25.250
你想騙走我的錢
about your plan to rob me of my money


1752
01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:28.070
把真的核芯素交給恩菲斯•内斯特
and give the real coaxium to Enfys Nest.


1753
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:29.770
德賴登先生 我不知道你在說什麼
Dryden, I don't know what you're thinking


1754
01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:31.320
或者琦拉是怎麼告訴你的 我絕不會…
or what Qi'ra may have told you...


1755
01:49:31.330 --> 01:49:33.710
這事跟琦拉沒關係
No, not Qi'ra. Not Qi'ra.


1756
01:49:33.710 --> 01:49:35.000
琦拉最後
Qi'ra, it turns out


1757
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:36.690
因為你心軟了
has a weak spot for you,


1758
01:49:36.690 --> 01:49:38.520
這事我們稍後再談
and we'll deal with that later.


1759
01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:42.480
我說的是我的另外一位手下
No, I'm talking about my other associate.


1760
01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:44.520
麻煩你進來跟我們見見吧
Can you come in and join us, please?


1761
01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:59.540
我真的很抱歉 孩子
I am sorry, kid.


1762
01:50:02.710 --> 01:50:04.070
為什麼這樣做
Why?


1763
01:50:04.410 --> 01:50:05.240
行了
Come on.


1764
01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:07.270
別那樣看著我
Don't look at me like that.


1765
01:50:07.310 --> 01:50:08.300
你就是聽不進去
You weren't paying attention.


1766
01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:11.070
我跟你說過 誰也別信
I told you, "Don't trust anybody."


1767
01:50:12.030 --> 01:50:14.200
我說錯了嗎
Am I wrong about that?


1768
01:50:18.410 --> 01:50:20.150
離那玩意遠點
Back away from that.


1769
01:50:20.150 --> 01:50:22.050
讓我看到你的爪子
Put your paws where I can see 'em.


1770
01:50:22.190 --> 01:50:24.020
檢查那個蓋子
Check that lid.


1771
01:50:26.170 --> 01:50:27.530
聰明
Clever.


1772
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:29.460
太晚了
It's too late.


1773
01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:31.900
核芯素已精煉好 在恩菲斯手上了
Coaxium's refined, and Enfys has it.


1774
01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:34.230
我們考慮到那邊了
Well, we figured that.


1775
01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:50.190
放下武器
Drop your weapons.


1776
01:50:53.790 --> 01:50:56.700
結束了 抓到了
It's over. We got them.


1777
01:50:56.850 --> 01:50:58.020
我們拿到貨了
And there we have it.


1778
01:50:58.030 --> 01:50:59.960
幹的漂亮 埃蒙 謝謝你
Excellent work, Aemon, thank you.


1779
01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:01.680
琦拉 幫我一下
Qi'ra, help me.


1780
01:51:04.030 --> 01:51:05.360
告訴我該怎麼做
Tell me what to do.


1781
01:51:06.430 --> 01:51:08.180
要是你會怎麼做
What would you do


1782
01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:12.310
如果你在這個世界上
if the person you most trusted in the world


1783
01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:14.350
最信任的人…背叛了你
betrayed you?


1784
01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:18.520
我會想知道為什麼
I would want to know why.


1785
01:51:20.730 --> 01:51:22.890
是出於一時的軟弱
If it was a moment of weakness


1786
01:51:23.060 --> 01:51:24.070
還是有其它原因
or something else.


1787
01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:25.120
然後呢
And then what?


1788
01:51:26.660 --> 01:51:29.690
然後我會要求那個人
And then, I would ask that person


1789
01:51:29.730 --> 01:51:31.980
犧牲他最鍾愛的東西
to prove their loyalty


1790
01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:35.720
以此來證明他的忠誠
by sacrificing something they love.


1791
01:51:44.150 --> 01:51:46.280
提醒過你要提防她
I tried to warn you about her.


1792
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:49.020
有件事你說錯了 你知道嗎
You know, you're wrong about one thing.


1793
01:51:49.150 --> 01:51:50.410
什麼事
What?


1794
01:51:50.450 --> 01:51:52.750
你說的話我聽進去了
I was paying attention.


1795
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:55.060
你跟丘伊說 人心是很好猜的
You told Chewie people are predictable.


1796
01:51:57.590 --> 01:51:59.690
你也不例外
You're no exception.


1797
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:06.480
是空的
It's empty.


1798
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:07.990
箱子是空的
The case is empty.


1799
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:10.400
怎麼回事兒 埃蒙 出什麼事兒了
Aemon, what's going on? What's happening there?


1800
01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:11.940
埃蒙
Aemon?


1801
01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:12.970
回答我
Talk to me.


1802
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:41.670
我希望你沒有把所有部下都派出去
I hope you didn't send all your fancy enforcers


1803
01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:43.370
要不然你在這邊人手可能有點不夠了
because that would leave you


1804
01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:45.830
如果那邊的箱子是空的
a little shorthanded around here.


1805
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:48.220
那麼
So,


1806
01:52:48.230 --> 01:52:52.680
真的核芯素
if that case is empty, then the real coaxium...


1807
01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:54.630
只屬於我們中的一個人
Leaves here with one of us.


1808
01:52:59.690 --> 01:53:01.070
貝克特 你在幹什麼
Beckett, what are you doing?


1809
01:53:01.070 --> 01:53:02.120
動腦子想想
Thinking.


1810
01:53:02.170 --> 01:53:03.520
我現在是唯一一個
And I prefer to be the only one


1811
01:53:03.590 --> 01:53:05.410
拿著槍的人
holding a blaster while I'm doing it.


1812
01:53:05.460 --> 01:53:07.060
漢 拿起那罐核芯素
Han, grab that coaxium,


1813
01:53:07.070 --> 01:53:08.360
放進盒子裡
put it in the case.


1814
01:53:08.370 --> 01:53:10.140
大個子你跟著我走
Big stuff, you're coming with me.


1815
01:53:11.850 --> 01:53:13.190
不要這樣 貝克特
Don't do this, Beckett.


1816
01:53:13.190 --> 01:53:14.980
- 我們有約在先 - 是啊
- We had a deal. - Yeah.


1817
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:15.840
對不起
I'm sorry,


1818
01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:17.480
我同樣是個投機者
but I'm also an entrepreneur.


1819
01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:20.060
我想你們都能理解我
I mean, you of all people understand that.


1820
01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:21.280
快 我們走
Come on, let's go.


1821
01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:24.180
你犯了一個大錯誤
You're making a huge mistake.


1822
01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:25.530
反正不是第一次
Won't be my first.


1823
01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:27.150
那將是你最後一次
It's gonna be your last.


1824
01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:28.590
也許吧
Maybe.


1825
01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:30.930
你怎麼這麼悲觀
Why you gotta be so negative?


1826
01:53:43.730 --> 01:53:45.050
漢
Han,


1827
01:53:45.050 --> 01:53:46.400
現在可是一個
now's as good a time as any


1828
01:53:46.410 --> 01:53:48.500
重新評估我們關係的好機會
to reevaluate our relationship.


1829
01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:50.010
怎麼說
How so?


1830
01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:52.640
我剛才在想
I was just thinking,


1831
01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:55.640
為什麼我們倆不聯手一起去找貝克特
why don't we join forces and go get Beckett together?


1832
01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:58.510
這是一個好主意 就這麼辦了 你先去
That is a great idea. Let's do it. You go first.


1833
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:01.790
漢
Oh, Han.


1834
01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:30.820
你贏不了我的 漢 就算你贏了
You can't win, Han, and even if you could,


1835
01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:32.080
後半輩子
you'd spend the rest of your life


1836
01:54:32.090 --> 01:54:33.400
你也沒法好好過
looking over your shoulder.


1837
01:54:34.490 --> 01:54:35.490
你知道嗎
You know what?


1838
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:38.420
我已經開始習慣這種生活了
I'm kind of getting used to the idea.


1839
01:54:45.790 --> 01:54:47.380
對不起
I'm sorry.


1840
01:54:47.450 --> 01:54:48.860
漢 她做過的事
Han, she's done things that


1841
01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:51.660
你永遠都無法理解 但是我理解
you could never understand, but I do.


1842
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:54.340
我完全能理解她
I understand her completely.


1843
01:54:55.230 --> 01:54:57.600
一旦你加入了血紅黎明
Once you're a part of Crimson Dawn,


1844
01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:59.400
就出不來了
you can't leave.


1845
01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:01.150
不是真的
It's not true.


1846
01:55:01.250 --> 01:55:02.680
我瞭解你
I know you.


1847
01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:04.980
這是我學到的
It's what I was taught.


1848
01:55:04.990 --> 01:55:06.870
找到對手的弱點
Find your opponent's weakness,


1849
01:55:06.990 --> 01:55:08.280
利用它
and use it,


1850
01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:10.420
而今天…
and today...


1851
01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:13.760
對手是你
I'm yours.


1852
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:41.460
我不得不…
I had to.


1853
01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:44.120
對 不 我是說
Yeah. No, I mean, you did...


1854
01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:46.740
你做到了
You did.


1855
01:55:48.850 --> 01:55:51.000
你得去追上貝克特和丘巴卡
Beckett and Chewbacca, you have to go after them.


1856
01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:52.260
那你怎麼辦
What are you gonna do?


1857
01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:55.020
如果我們把核芯素都交給了恩菲斯
Well, if we give all the coaxium to Enfys,


1858
01:55:55.130 --> 01:55:57.800
就得想其它辦法買船了
we're gonna need something to buy our ship with.


1859
01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:14.180
- 琦拉 - 去救丘巴卡
- Qi'ra... - Go and save Chewbacca.


1860
01:56:14.230 --> 01:56:17.300
他需要你 而你也會需要他的
He needs you and you're gonna need him, too.


1861
01:56:23.770 --> 01:56:24.770
微笑
Smile.


1862
01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:28.900
我就是這樣
That's the word.


1863
01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:31.210
每次我想像
Whenever I imagined myself


1864
01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:33.150
自己跟你一起冒險的時候
off with you on some adventure...


1865
01:56:34.590 --> 01:56:36.660
我就會微笑
Always makes me smile.


1866
01:56:44.140 --> 01:56:45.970
快去 我馬上就來
Go. I'm right behind you.


1867
01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:39.150
什麼事
Yes?


1868
01:57:39.150 --> 01:57:42.550
我遺憾地向您彙報 德賴登•沃斯已死
I regret to inform you that Dryden Vos is dead,


1869
01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:44.520
兇手是他雇來
murdered by the thief he hired


1870
01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:46.120
偷核芯素的盜賊
to steal the coaxium shipment,


1871
01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:47.380
他的舊友
his friend,


1872
01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:49.440
托拜西•貝克特
Tobias Beckett.


1873
01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:51.560
這樣啊
Is that so?


1874
01:57:52.350 --> 01:57:55.580
那批貨現在在哪
Where is the shipment now?


1875
01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:57.120
不見了
Gone.


1876
01:57:57.160 --> 01:57:58.150
貝克特拿走了
Beckett took it.


1877
01:57:58.230 --> 01:58:00.870
除了我 其他人都死了
Slaughtered the others. I alone survived.


1878
01:58:03.650 --> 01:58:06.880
兇手不可能單槍匹馬吧
One man couldn't have done this alone.


1879
01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:09.450
我當時不在場
I wasn't there,


1880
01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:12.090
要不然我還能救他
but if I had been, perhaps I could have saved him.


1881
01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:23.750
駕駛飛船來達索米爾找我
Bring the ship and come to me on Dathomir


1882
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:25.780
你和我將決定
and you and I will then decide


1883
01:58:25.780 --> 01:58:28.580
如何處置叛徒
what to do about the traitor, Beckett,


1884
01:58:28.630 --> 01:58:31.070
貝克特和他的同夥
and his accomplices.


1885
01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:34.330
我馬上出發
I'm on my way.


1886
01:58:36.910 --> 01:58:38.140
琦拉
Qi'ra,


1887
01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:39.470
你和我...
you and I


1888
01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:42.770
今後要
will be working much more closely


1889
01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:44.850
更加緊密地開展工作
from now on.


1890
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:17.080
不得不說 你很執著
You're relentless. I'll give you that.


1891
01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:20.580
我儘快趕過來了 夥計
Came as fast as I could, buddy.


1892
01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:22.490
德賴登死了吧
Dryden dead?


1893
01:59:24.490 --> 01:59:26.330
是琦拉殺的
Qi'ra kill him?


1894
01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:30.680
你還是不明白 孩子
Still don't get it, do you, kid?


1895
01:59:30.930 --> 01:59:33.160
她這樣做不是為了你
It was never about you.


1896
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:35.000
是為了她自己
She's a survivor.


1897
01:59:36.170 --> 01:59:37.730
你知道你的問題嗎
You know what your problem is?


1898
01:59:37.730 --> 01:59:39.800
你以為所有人都跟你一樣
You think everybody's like you.


1899
01:59:40.570 --> 01:59:42.250
你不一樣 孩子
Not you, kid.


1900
01:59:42.250 --> 01:59:43.690
你跟我完全不一樣
You're nothing like me.


1901
01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:47.340
我希望你還記得我的話
I hope you're still paying attention


1902
01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:49.410
因為現在我要告訴你最重要的
because now I'm gonna tell you the most important...


1903
02:00:04.580 --> 02:00:07.030
你學聰明了 孩子
You made the smart move, kid.


1904
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:08.590
至少這次很聰明
For once.


1905
02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.600
我是想殺了你的
I woulda killed you.


1906
02:00:18.940 --> 02:00:23.860
我是真的想學會彈梵弦琴
I really was gonna learn to play that valachord.


1907
02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:25.180
我知道
I know.


1908
02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:19.840
好了 都裝好了
That's it. It's all loaded.


1909
02:02:23.850 --> 02:02:25.440
你知道那是什麼嗎
Do you know what that really is?


1910
02:02:25.500 --> 02:02:26.420
知道
Yeah.


1911
02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:29.400
價值六千萬信用點的精煉核芯素
About 60 million credits worth of refined coaxium.


1912
02:02:29.410 --> 02:02:30.720
不
No.


1913
02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:33.160
這是一份催生新事物的血液
It's the blood that brings life to something new.


1914
02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:35.500
是嗎 什麼新事物
Yeah, what?


1915
02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:36.540
一支起義軍
A rebellion.


1916
02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:39.560
你可以加入我們
You could come with us, you know.


1917
02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:41.890
我們很需要你這樣的戰士和領袖
We need warriors and leaders like you.


1918
02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:50.600
也許有一天你會改變主意的
Maybe someday you'll feel different.


1919
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:53.260
你可別傻等著 孩子
Don't hold your breath, kid.


1920
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:09.220
別弄丟了
Don't lose that.


1921
02:03:21.150 --> 02:03:23.110
很少有人親眼見過
Very few people have actually seen


1922
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:24.620
星洞星雲
the StarCave Nebula.


1923
02:03:24.690 --> 02:03:25.990
美得窒息
It's breathtaking.


1924
02:03:26.010 --> 02:03:27.500
就像你的眼睛
Not unlike your eyes.


1925
02:03:27.650 --> 02:03:29.730
你聽說過彼此纏繞的天體嗎
How much do you know about intertwined celestial bodies?


1926
02:03:29.730 --> 02:03:31.950
我剛好是這方面的專家
Because I happen to be something of an authority.


1927
02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:34.150
其實呢 我…
By the way...


1928
02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:41.830
漢
Han!


1929
02:03:41.940 --> 02:03:43.080
你還活著
You're alive!


1930
02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:44.410
是的 多虧了你啊
Yeah, no thanks to you.


1931
02:03:44.410 --> 02:03:46.170
我早應該讓丘伊把你的胳膊擰下來
I should have Chewie rip your arms off.


1932
02:03:46.170 --> 02:03:47.700
是不是 丘伊 動手
In fact, Chewie, do it.


1933
02:03:47.700 --> 02:03:48.880
漢 我們是朋友
Hey, Han! We are friends.


1934
02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:50.590
別這樣 我們是朋友 對嗎
You know that. We're friends. All right?


1935
02:03:55.790 --> 02:03:57.670
瞧給你嚇的
Oh, look at you.


1936
02:03:57.670 --> 02:03:59.560
真以為他要擰下你胳膊來呢
Thought he was gonna rip your arms off.


1937
02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:00.640
我知道你在逗我
I knew you were kidding.


1938
02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:01.490
你壓根不知道
No, you didn't.


1939
02:04:01.490 --> 02:04:03.310
- 那麼我那份呢 - 你那份
- So, where's my cut? - Your cut?


1940
02:04:04.420 --> 02:04:06.630
不 恐怕沒了 我們差點就掛了
No, I don't think so. We barely made it out alive.


1941
02:04:06.630 --> 02:04:08.430
我們只拿到這些了
All we ended up with was that.


1942
02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:12.380
估計這些值一萬吧
Figure it's worth about 10,000,


1943
02:04:12.380 --> 02:04:14.100
應該是夠下個注了
maybe enough for a decent buy-in.


1944
02:04:16.220 --> 02:04:17.660
你想再賭一局
You want a rematch?


1945
02:04:19.030 --> 02:04:20.300
為什麼不呢
Why not?


1946
02:04:24.210 --> 02:04:26.170
現在棄牌
You fold now,


1947
02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:27.110
你可能還有錢給自己
you walk away with enough


1948
02:04:27.110 --> 02:04:29.210
買一艘小船
to get yourself your own little ship.


1949
02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:31.130
你跟牌
You call,


1950
02:04:32.220 --> 02:04:33.930
你又得輸個精光了
I'm gonna clean you out again.


1951
02:04:46.450 --> 02:04:47.780
我覺得我手氣還不錯
I don't know, I'm feeling lucky.


1952
02:04:52.700 --> 02:04:55.070
我看你是真的迷上千年隼了吧
You really have it bad for the Falcon, don't you?


1953
02:04:55.140 --> 02:04:57.770
兩廂情願 相信我 它是屬於我的
It's mutual, trust me. She belongs with me.


1954
02:05:07.420 --> 02:05:09.910
你的牌都準備好了嗎 老兄
You got everything you need there, pal?


1955
02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:21.200
真不錯
Not bad.


1956
02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:24.220
真不錯 你知道嗎
Not bad. You know,


1957
02:05:24.220 --> 02:05:28.070
要是如果你手上有了這張小綠牌
if you'd only had this little green sylop,


1958
02:05:28.070 --> 02:05:29.560
你就可以贏我了
you would've beaten this.


1959
02:05:35.420 --> 02:05:38.380
公平公正啊 寶貝 非常公平
Fair and square, baby. Fair and square.


1960
02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:50.610
貝克特之前跟我說
Beckett said he heard about this


1961
02:05:50.610 --> 02:05:52.900
有位頭兒在招人幹活兒
very big gangster putting together a job.


1962
02:05:53.690 --> 02:05:55.850
不 我跟你說啊
No, I'm telling ya,


1963
02:05:55.930 --> 02:05:57.220
那活肯定不錯
it's gonna be great.


1964
02:05:57.340 --> 02:05:59.200
我什麼時候坑過你
When have I ever steered you wrong?
