1
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.860
Oh.

2
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.260
Patricia.

3
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.860
So, I have a patient
that is coming in five minutes.


4
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.340
I can ask him
to come back later.


5
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.260
Please.

6
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.860
This song, it's stuck
in my head, and it's so loud.


7
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.260
They're going to try
to keep her alive after all.


8
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.500
Markos?

9
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.700
[Speaking German] Quick, get us seats
over there before those boys take them!

10
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.940
[Speaking German] The guitarist is so cute...

11
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.980
[Speaking German] I was right.

12
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.820
[Speaking German] They are witches..

13
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.780
I have to tell Sara
to get out of there.


14
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.900
She's the only girl
I actually give a damn about.


15
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.020
"Her delusions has deepened into panic.

16
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.940
She feels her constructed mythology is confirmed."

17
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.100
If I leave without her,

18
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.300
they may pick her next.

19
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.740
Or Olga.

20
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.460
I should warn Olga, too.

21
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.180
Olga's already
figured out things.


22
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.780
She saw how they groomed me.

23
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.940
There's more in that building
than what you can see.


24
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.580
They've been underground
since the war.


25
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.380
And you think
they can hear you now?


26
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.980
At the beginning,
they gave me things.


27
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.660
Perfect balance, perfect sleep.

28
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.260
Talking with our minds.

29
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.500
But they took my hair.

30
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.300
They took my urine. They...

31
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.980
They took my eyes.

32
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.300
Now she can see me.

33
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.780
Mother Markos.

34
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.300
Oh, she wants
to get inside of me.


35
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.900
I can feel her.

36
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.460
Oh, I thought I wanted it.

37
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.940
I let it happen.

38
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.700
If they find out I was here,
they won't hesitate.


39
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.260
[Speaking German] They'll hollow me out
and eat my cunt on plate.

40
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.740
[Speaking German] Mr. 
Berger is waiting for you, Doctor.

41
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.900
Okay, that's good. That's good.

42
00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.180
Did the rain get your clothes
all wet?


43
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.220
No, don't you worry. The girls
just hung that all up.


44
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.540
is what I just heard
on the radio.


45
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.940
-That'll just about do it.
-Just about.


46
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.660
How is she today?

47
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.300
You're Miss Tanner?

48
00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.020
Yes. Come in.

49
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.300
Nah?

50
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.100
I tried to call you
at your hotel this morning


51
00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.700
to ask you
if you could reschedule.


52
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.500
-Why?
-Company business.


53
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.740
It's not a good time
just today.


54
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.380
But here you are.

55
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.940
And one, and two,

56
00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.460
and three, and four,

57
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.300
and five,

58
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.980
and six, and seven,

59
00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.220
and eight.

60
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.580
Elbows up. And one...

61
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.140
Come in, Susie.

62
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.820
Miss Millius and Miss Mandel
are the company's repetiteurs.


63
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.820
And Veva Blanc?

64
00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.900
I was told she would be here.

65
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.380
Oh, dear.

66
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.700
You have no formal training
or references.


67
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.860
Your insistence to audition

68
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.340
happened to catch Madame Blanc
on a good day.


69
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.940
But you really shouldn't
be here at all.


70
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.420
Do you understand?

71
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.180
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah?


72
00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:43.980
Good.

73
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.060
Uh...

74
00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.100
I prefer dancing without music.

75
00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.820
Danke schoen.

76
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.060
You can keep time
in your head, yes?


77
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.140
Mm-hmm, and Hypnose.

78
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.260
And here we have...

79
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.860
a line between the elbows.

80
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.140
Face forward.

81
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.260
Perfect, and... Morphus.

82
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.940
And here,
not so close to the face.


83
00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.140
More like you're holding
a bird or something.


84
00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.300
They did it when we
were in morning rehearsal.


85
00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.460
They just put her things
in shipping boxes.


86
00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.900
You don't think she
had to go underground, do you?


87
00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.620
I don't care what happened.

88
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.260
I just want her to call.

89
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.540
I'm really worried.

90
00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.740
Fraulein Bannion.

91
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.020
Come (Kommen Sie in French)

92
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.540
I've just spoken
with Madame Blanc.


93
00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.060
Well done, Miss Bannion.

94
00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.740
I imagine you will need
to return home


95
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.180
to settle things
and make arrangements


96
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.060
for moving to Berlin.

97
00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.340
No. No, no.

98
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.860
I can start right now.

99
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.660
Good.

100
00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.380
This is Miss Boutaher,

101
00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.420
our technical director.

102
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.060
Guten Tag.

103
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.500
And this is Miss Vendegast.

104
00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.460
-She acts as house mother...
-Hello.


105
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.020
...for our dancers
who reside here.


106
00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:50.580
Where'd you come from?

107
00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.700
Ohio.

108
00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.140
We operate as a sort
of Ruth Bré collective.


109
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.980
As we cannot pay our dancers
a lot of money,


110
00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.140
we offer dormitory-style rooms,
rent-free.


111
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.820
You don't... you don't charge
anything at all?


112
00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.180
Not a mark.

113
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.100
In this company,
we fully understand


114
00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.460
the importance of a woman's
financial autonomy.


115
00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.900
Normally, it would be full
at this time of year,


116
00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.500
but we have had a room open.

117
00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.140
Yeah. Patricia's.

118
00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.180
Do you know Patricia?

119
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.380
Mmm...

120
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.780
No, I heard some girls talking

121
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.300
about her in the hall.

122
00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.060
Ah.

123
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.180
Now that you're one of us,
I won't be coy.


124
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.140
Patricia has just left
the company


125
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.740
under sad circumstances.

126
00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.220
We think she won't be back,
so there's room if you want.


127
00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:58.820
We'll send you one of our girls
to help you with your luggage.


128
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.540
After lunch.

129
00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.260
It's all right for you?

130
00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.780
Yes.

131
00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:04.940
It's-it... it's all...

132
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.660
Yes.

133
00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.180
It's perfect.

134
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.260
Hello. Hi.
I'm sorry I'm late.


135
00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.860
-Hi.
-It's the rain.


136
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.660
Whenever it rains in Berlin,
everyone jumps in a cab,


137
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.460
and like an idiot,
I just let ours go.


138
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.020
Hi. I'm Sara.

139
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.820
We're gonna have to take
our chances on the street.


140
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.580
Do you have an umbrella?

141
00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.540
Oh, when you weren't here
by 6:00,


142
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.780
I had to take the room
for another night.


143
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.300
Oh. God, Susie, I'm sorry.

144
00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.180
Everything was a mess
at the company today.


145
00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.500
Why are you smiling?

146
00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.420
I'm sor... I
-I...

147
00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.180
Um, uh, when you said Berlin
a second ago,


148
00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.780
you said "everyone in Berlin,"

149
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.380
and I just thought that...
that includes me now.


150
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:07.940
I live in Berlin.

151
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.180
Yes. Congrats.

152
00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.540
I heard you were
a sensation today.


153
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.340
Have you called your
family yet, to tell them?


154
00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.060
Miss Blanc came
into my audition.


155
00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.980
But she left right after.

156
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.340
She's incredible.

157
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.700
The way she transmits her work,
her energy.


158
00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.780
When it shines on you, it's...

159
00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.620
"addictive" is the word for it.

160
00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.060
She's tough.

161
00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.340
She kept the company alive
through the war.


162
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.340
When the Reich just wanted
women to shut off their minds


163
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.660
and keep their uteruses open,

164
00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.620
there was Blanc.

165
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:40.780
Thank you.

166
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.140
The real thing (La vraie chose in French)

167
00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:43.980
What?

168
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.060
W
-Was that French?

169
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.860
It's a bomb.

170
00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.900
I can smell it.

171
00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.220
There's a bank that way.

172
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.900
Don't you know
what's happening here?


173
00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.540
The hijackers
are negotiating a release


174
00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.860
of the Stammheim prisoners
tonight.


175
00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.660
The RAF.

176
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.020
Baader
-Meinhof.

177
00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.100
They kidnapped an executive.

178
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:19.020
During the war,
he was a Nazi SS, an officer.


179
00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:23.220
Now he runs the German
Employers' Association.


180
00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.780
You don't get how awful
that is, do you?


181
00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.300
Sorry.

182
00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.020
I'm just worried
about my friend.


183
00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.740
Now for the voting

184
00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.860
each of us says
the name of her choice

185
00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.300
Mandel, whom are you voting for?

186
00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.900
Markos.

187
00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:10.020
Miss Killen?

188
00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.460
Blanc.

189
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.460
Judith?

190
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.020
Markos.

191
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:14.940
Boutaher?

192
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.060
Blanc.

193
00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.420
Millius?

194
00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.700
Markos.

195
00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:19.660
Martincin?

196
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:20.780
Markos.

197
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:21.740
Huller?

198
00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:22.860
Markos.

199
00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.940
Mauceri?

200
00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:24.660
Blanc.

201
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.060
Marks?

202
00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:28.900
Marcos.

203
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.060
Pavla?

204
00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.060
Blanc.

205
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.380
Vendegast?

206
00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:33.620
Blanc.

207
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:34.860
Balfour?

208
00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:35.660
Blanc.

209
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:36.940
Creusot?

210
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:37.780
Blanc.

211
00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.220
Alberta?

212
00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:40.620
Marcos.

213
00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:42.620
Griffith?

214
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:46.500
Griffith?

215
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.420
We are at the end.

216
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.540
You must choose!

217
00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:53.980
Mother Markos.

218
00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.300
Blanc, whom are you voting for?

219
00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.420
I abstain.

220
00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.060
I vote for Markos.

221
00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.540
Markos wins by three.

222
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.460
It is decided.

223
00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.380
Mother Markos will remain in control.

224
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.100
Let no ones's vote be held against her.

225
00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.740
And let the will of the majority proceed.

226
00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:20.100
Long life to Markos.

227
00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:37.020
"..there is no information yet on whether the hijackers will pilot the Lufthansa flight to
a fourth destination or what is the condition of the 91 hostages still presumed aboard.

228
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:46.500
Yesterday, one of the Palestinian hijackers issued official demands including
the release of all RAF members incarcerated at Stammshein prison.."

229
00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.620
TANNER: Mother asked for you.

230
00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.540
She has to know
that we can move ahead

231
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.460
now that last night's business is behind us.

232
00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.860
BLANC: You all knew my concerns about Patricia.

233
00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.180
TANNER: What happened to Patricia was ghostly.

234
00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.540
But now that we voted
Mother wants to try again.

235
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:15.620
And so soon.

236
00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.460
BLANC: The question isn't
just who to try next.

237
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.780
We have to make sure the ritual
will work with whichever girl we choose.

238
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.100
TANNER: Mother trusts you already
have ideas on this subject.

239
00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.100
Maybe Sara could be a good option.

240
00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:38.820
Yes. It was right to send
her to collect the American girl.

241
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.900
Sara is a good
ambassador for the good company.

242
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.940
She's made a home here, hasn't she?

243
00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:46.940
She feels good here.

244
00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.140
Loved.

245
00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.140
Uncle Josef!

246
00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.860
Good morning my dear!

247
00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.460
Are you going to your country house? 
- Yes!

248
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.940
I'm freezing my ass off. 
I'll go to the university later on with Clara.

249
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:05.820
Who is speaking?

250
00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.140
Lacan. 
- Ah, Lacan!

251
00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.260
Good morning, Doctor Klempere!

252
00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.180
Are you going to the country house?

253
00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.340
"Next stop Friedrichstrasse.

254
00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.740
This train terminates here.

255
00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.660
Please have your identification
ready to enter East Berlin."

256
00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.540
Anke, look...

257
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.540
everything is full of leaves again!

258
00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:23.740
I swept them away just last Tuesday.

259
00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.580
Why don't you try speaking
to me like you love me?


260
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.980
Huh?

261
00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.700
For a change.

262
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.460
This is my room.

263
00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.020
And here...

264
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.380
is yours.

265
00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.660
We're neighbors.

266
00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.180
You can knock on the wall
if you ever need anything.


267
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.540
Miss Sesame?

268
00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:18.860
Doctor, I got the semolina from Mrs. Meir.

269
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:24.300
They are demonstrating again for
the release of the RAF terrorists.

270
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.220
Ensslin, Meinhof...

271
00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:30.700
Before the war Germany had the strongest women...

272
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.740
Like your wife Anke.

273
00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.660
Wasn't she strong, Doctor?

274
00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.300
"First rehearsal in the Iris Studio today.

275
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.820
in twenty minutes.

276
00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.980
You're to lead your own stretches today."

277
00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.100
Good morning.

278
00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:48.980
-Good morning.
-Hello.


279
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.780
-Good morning.
-Good morning.


280
00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.580
-Hi.
-Good morning. Good morning.


281
00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.340
How's your knee? Okay?

282
00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.220
It's wonderful you're here.

283
00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.420
Thank you.

284
00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.820
We have some happier
company business today.


285
00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.860
We have a new dancer.

286
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.460
This is Susie Bannion,
who's joining us from America.


287
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.220
I was privileged to witness
her audition yesterday.


288
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.580
We are very lucky to have her.

289
00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.540
Would you like
to say something, Susie?


290
00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.140
Um...

291
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.580
I don't know.

292
00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.300
Hello.

293
00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:34.660
I feel like
I'm not even here yet.


294
00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:35.940
I don't know.

295
00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.100
You join in
whenever you feel ready,


296
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.860
but there's no rush.

297
00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:42.060
Welcome to our little family.

298
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.260
I'm Susie.

299
00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.420
Hi. Hi.

300
00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.780
All right,
so for today's rehearsal,


301
00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:50.660
I want to pick up exactly
where we left off with Volk.


302
00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:51.940
I've spoken to Olga,

303
00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.740
and she's going to dance
Patricia's part.


304
00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:59.420
And, Sara, I'd like you
to dance Olga's part.


305
00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:00.780
Is everyone happy with that?

306
00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:03.460
Okay.

307
00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.780
Good.

308
00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Music off, please.


309
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.220
One moment.

310
00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.500
Okay, so...

311
00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.620
And one, and two, and three.

312
00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.180
You pull it from the ground.

313
00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:27.940
All right? Gravity, remember.

314
00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.020
And everybody from here,
please.


315
00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.420
And Tanner.

316
00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.460
One and two and three.

317
00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.580
And one, and two, and three.

318
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.820
And one and two and three(
Und eins, und zwei, und drei)

319
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.340
And one and two and three(
Und eins, und zwei, und drei)

320
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.340
And one and two and three(
Und eins, und zwei, und drei)

321
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.580
And one and two and three(
Und eins, und zwei, und drei)

322
00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.500
And one and two and three(
Und eins, und zwei, und drei)

323
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.460
And one and two and three(
Und eins, und zwei, und drei)

324
00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:50.780
And one and two and three(
Und eins, und zwei, und drei)

325
00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.460
This is shit.

326
00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:55.980
-Such shit.
-Okay.


327
00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.060
Why don't we all break
for ten minutes.


328
00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:02.180
You can't even be bothered
to respect your own lies.


329
00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.940
Miss Ivanova!

330
00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:05.940
No, no, no, no, no, it's okay.

331
00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.500
Let's face this.

332
00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.260
Patricia is gone, Olga.

333
00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.420
We don't know where.

334
00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.300
If she's gone into hiding,
she wouldn't have told us,


335
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.620
-would she?
-She would have told someone.


336
00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.220
We know that she had dealings

337
00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.620
with people
who are interested in targets.


338
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:22.980
And we know
there was another bomb


339
00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:24.220
in Kreuzberg last night.

340
00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:25.340
She wouldn't do that.

341
00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.420
She wanted to live her beliefs.

342
00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.700
Who doesn't admire that?

343
00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:34.260
And there's so much to change
in the world.


344
00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:35.980
If she wants to live
in a cellar


345
00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:38.940
filling bottles with petrol,
that's her choice.


346
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.020
And who won't be heartbroken
if she's shot by police?


347
00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.940
You manipulate everything.

348
00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.060
She didn't trust you
because you're hypocrites.


349
00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.660
Will you take Olga
to her room, please, Tanner?


350
00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:55.700
No, Miss Tanner!

351
00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:58.620
Call Olga a cab.

352
00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:00.660
She's had enough.

353
00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.260
And is going to pack her things

354
00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.860
and get the fuck out
from this box of rabies!


355
00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.260
Witches!

356
00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.500
I'm sorry about that.

357
00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.900
It's a hot thing we do.

358
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:37.100
Okay, so... who will dance
the protagonist?


359
00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.860
Sonia?

360
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.540
I can't. Not yet.

361
00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.100
Caroline?

362
00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.100
Very well. We'll manage.

363
00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:52.340
I suggest that we all
take it from the top.


364
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.980
I'll dance.

365
00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.580
I know it.

366
00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.140
It's in the documentary.

367
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.180
I-I've seen it a hundred times
at the library.


368
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.500
Sweetheart,
we rehearsed this piece


369
00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.300
for ten months
before we performed it.


370
00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:20.340
I've seen it in person, too.

371
00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.940
First do it alone, then.

372
00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:26.500
We don't want to put
the others at risk.


373
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.300
The last thing we need

374
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.940
is someone to get kicked
in the ribs.


375
00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:37.420
All right?

376
00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:33.500
Okay, stop. Stop, stop.

377
00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.140
Stop.

378
00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.700
All right.

379
00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.420
Clear your head.

380
00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:40.380
I want you to start over.

381
00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:42.740
Have you stretched?

382
00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:44.700
This is no joke.

383
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.940
Olga.

384
00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:19.340
Olga.

385
00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.660
Come.

386
00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.020
Remember, you start
on one with the music,


387
00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:58.180
and if you feel ill
at any time, just stop.


388
00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.220
You start here.

389
00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.460
And...

390
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.700
Lauter!

391
00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.340
Bravo. Bravo, Susie.

392
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.900
It'll pass.

393
00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.700
You're not the first dancer
who lost the room.


394
00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:28.980
I'm not usually dizzy.

395
00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.340
An occasional collapse

396
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.860
is a vocational hazard,
I'm afraid.


397
00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:36.260
I-I didn't...
I didn't collapse.


398
00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:39.380
You're on the floor, and that's
not where the dance ends.


399
00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.780
I was trying not to throw up
in your studio.


400
00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.260
Susie, it's fine.

401
00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.500
It was wonderful.

402
00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:51.700
Sara, can you take her
to her room, please?


403
00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.140
You can rest
for the rest of the day.


404
00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.460
- How enlightening.
- Okay, come on, girls.


405
00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.100
Let's go.

406
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.540
And one, and two, and three.

407
00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:13.980
And...

408
00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:03.580
No, Susie.

409
00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:07.220
We have to study America.

410
00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.980
I said no.

411
00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.020
Susanna.

412
00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.220
Everything fine?

413
00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.700
Attention, please!

414
00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.420
Don't hurt Olga.

415
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:09.060
Slowly...

416
00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:00.580
Out!

417
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.860
"Police station, good evening."

418
00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:32.060
Good evening, I'm reporting a
young woman who may be missing.

419
00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:35.700
BLANC: She couldn't have
known what she was doing.

420
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.700
She just carried more of
our intention than we expected.

421
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:42.660
We also let ourselves get angry with Olga.

422
00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.740
TANNER: I could feel it.

423
00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.340
But the girl is natural.

424
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:49.820
Like Patricia. 
Only clean somehow.

425
00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.140
She may be more what we're looking for.

426
00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:53.860
even than Sara.

427
00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:56.700
Are we saying that?

428
00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:59.860
BLANC: No. I'm not saying that yet.

429
00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:08.180
You don't look better.

430
00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.620
Or are you this pale
all the time?


431
00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:13.500
I will leave you.

432
00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.020
Good night.

433
00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:26.740
The Amish split

434
00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:29.140
from the Mennonites
in the 17th century.


435
00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:30.260
They were worried
the Mennonites


436
00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.940
were becoming too liberal.

437
00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:35.220
"They"? Not "we"?

438
00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:38.620
You've left religious thinking
behind you, then?


439
00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.020
And you're not comfortable
talking about these things.


440
00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:43.260
I don't know why we are.

441
00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:44.980
It's difficult not
to be curious about you.


442
00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:47.380
In two days, you've auditioned,

443
00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:50.900
been accepted
and danced a lead.


444
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:53.700
How did your journey
towards us begin?


445
00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.340
I went to New York.

446
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.660
To the Martha Graham Center.

447
00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:00.380
I saw you there three times.

448
00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:02.060
I went once by bus,

449
00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.580
then I hitchhiked
the other two.


450
00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:07.220
That's risky.

451
00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:09.340
Were you punished?

452
00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.780
Yeah.

453
00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:15.060
But I felt I had to see you.

454
00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.700
What did it feel today

455
00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:29.620
to dance Volkin front
of the one who made it?


456
00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:31.580
No, no.
That's a vain question.


457
00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:33.740
Let me ask you another.

458
00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:37.820
When you were dancing,
what did it feel like...


459
00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:41.340
inside you, inside your body?

460
00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:51.260
It felt like what I think
it must feel like to fuck.


461
00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:53.260
You mean to fuck a man?

462
00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:55.380
No, I...

463
00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:57.020
was thinking of an animal.

464
00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:06.860
You looked...

465
00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:20.940
I'm going to ask Caroline
to work on your jumps with you.


466
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.540
Yours are nowhere near
good enough yet.


467
00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.380
We'll have to build you up.

468
00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:28.820
So that I can dance
the protagonist


469
00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:30.700
when you perform it?

470
00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:34.220
I'll need to see you dance at
this level time and time again.


471
00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:35.500
I can do it.

472
00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:45.140
Olga made Volkseem
like such heavy lifting.


473
00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:47.940
She never understood
the heart of Volk.


474
00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:52.460
She lacked conviction.

475
00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:54.420
I'm relieved she's gone.

476
00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:59.060
Thank you for your help
with that.


477
00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:07.620
Madame Blanc...

478
00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:12.460
wants me to dance
the protagonist in Volk.


479
00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:18.300
I didn't think it was
gonna be like this.


480
00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:21.260
She's so kind.

481
00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:22.980
That's wonderful.

482
00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.220
Are you all right?

483
00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:32.860
I'm fine. I was just...

484
00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:38.700
I was just thinking about
what Olga said in rehearsal.


485
00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:40.380
About Patricia.

486
00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:42.660
What do you mean?

487
00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:46.260
She was active
in some political groups.


488
00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:50.540
No one knows where she is,
really.


489
00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.940
If she's all right.

490
00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:55.460
Was it true...

491
00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.100
what Olga said?

492
00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:01.300
Yes.

493
00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.900
Patricia didn't trust
the matrons.


494
00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:07.500
And I never understood why.

495
00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:14.300
If I asked you for a favor
tomorrow, would you do it?


496
00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:15.460
Yes.

497
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.900
We might get caught.

498
00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:26.900
Okay.

499
00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:13.300
Mother. Mother.

500
00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:15.180
Mother.

501
00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:18.220
Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother.

502
00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:19.940
Mother. Mother.

503
00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:24.620
Susanna.

504
00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:11.420
Come inside, hurry up!

505
00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:16.260
What do you want?

506
00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.980
We need to talk to someone in charge.

507
00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:20.420
Miss Markos!

508
00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:24.620
About a girl named Patrizia...

509
00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:30.260
Patricia Hingle.

510
00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:37.780
Someone named Blanc then?

511
00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.260
I'm she.

512
00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:45.740
Why don't you come in?

513
00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:47.900
Please...

514
00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:50.380
Follow me.

515
00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:00.980
-Guten Morgen.
-Guten Morgen.


516
00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:02.100
Morgen.

517
00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.740
Guten Morgen.

518
00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:15.420
Yeah, I know. It's crazy.

519
00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:17.420
Okay, well, let's meet soon.

520
00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:26.300
Yeah, no, I'm
-I'm... I'm ready.

521
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:28.380
I'm almost out the door.

522
00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:30.180
Okay. Yeah.

523
00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:32.740
-I'll see you soon.
-Marketa.


524
00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:37.260
-Marketa, come on.
-I'll see you soon.


525
00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.580
Come on.

526
00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:59.460
Come, come, come.

527
00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:12.740
Are you sure no one's coming?

528
00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:14.780
Oh, I'm sure. Don't worry.

529
00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:16.980
Nobody comes here
during the weekend.


530
00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:45.700
Patricia's isn't here.

531
00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:48.100
Try looking for Olga's.

532
00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:49.700
Olga...

533
00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:51.860
She's not here.

534
00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:55.820
I just need a number.

535
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:58.100
For her parents or someone
who can tell me for sure


536
00:54:58.260 --> 00:54:59.460
she is or isn't in Berlin.

537
00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:22.060
Hmm. How odd.

538
00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:28.100
1961.

539
00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:31.340
1955.

540
00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:34.820
1949.

541
00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:37.580
It's bizarre.

542
00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:44.140
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty...


543
00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:15.540
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty...


544
00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:30.900
There's nothing.

545
00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:32.420
Come on.

546
00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:38.660
Sit down.

547
00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:44.860
This morning,

548
00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:47.700
we turn our instincts inward.

549
00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:49.180
Miss Millius, Miss Mandel,

550
00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.100
can you close the mirrors,
please?


551
00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:52.340
Miss Marks, no music.

552
00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:03.580
I want to start work
on a new piece.


553
00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:07.700
A piece about rebirths.

554
00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:10.700
The inevitable pull
that they exert


555
00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:14.500
and our efforts to escape them.

556
00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:17.220
We'll learn it now, but, Susie,

557
00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:20.100
you will improvise freely
at its heart.


558
00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:22.060
I'm interested
in your instincts here.


559
00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:35.260
The piece will be called
Weider OÖffnen.


560
00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:37.140
Open Again.

561
00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:38.660
Allez.

562
00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:48.540
One, two, three, four.

563
00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:52.140
One, two,
three, four.


564
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:55.660
One, two, three, four.

565
00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:59.420
One, two,
three, four.


566
00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:02.940
One, two, three, four.

567
00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:05.500
One, two,
three, four.


568
00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:09.940
One, two, three, four.

569
00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:13.380
One, two,
three, four.


570
00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.940
One, two, three, four.

571
00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:18.180
One...

572
00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:20.340
...two, three, four.

573
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:24.100
One, two, three, four.

574
00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:27.140
One, two, three, four.

575
00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:30.940
One, two, three, four.

576
00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:34.500
One, two,
three, four.


577
00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:38.140
One, two, three, four.

578
00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:41.500
One, two,
three, four.


579
00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:44.860
One, two, three, four.

580
00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:46.580
One...

581
00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:07.140
You should have told me she was coming.

582
00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:09.740
She wanted to fell Susie for herself.

583
00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:11.900
So you put her...

584
00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:14.580
in a storage closet!

585
00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:15.660
Under the floor?

586
00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:17.420
Helena Markos?

587
00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:20.060
Mother wanted it.

588
00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:22.900
I though we agreed
to stop using that title.

589
00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:28.780
If Markos really were one of the
Three Mothers we wouldn't be in this situation.

590
00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:33.500
You should have told
Markos about Miss Bannion yourself.

591
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:35.220
Now Mother wants her.

592
00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:40.100
Are we going to
waste another girl so quickly?

593
00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:42.500
Everyone voted.

594
00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:45.860
You are not the
light we chose to follow.

595
00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:50.580
If Markos wants this
girl, you must prepare her.

596
00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:51.540
And does she?

597
00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:52.140
Yes!

598
00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:55.620
Markos will live.

599
00:59:56.820 --> 00:59:59.900
We found the girl in time.

600
01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.740
I won't rush again.

601
01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:19.980
I will tell Markos
when the girl is ready.

602
01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.140
Miss Balfour!

603
01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:23.820
Alright!

604
01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:27.660
Did something happen?

605
01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:29.860
-Hmm?
-To you, during it?


606
01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.060
N
-No.

607
01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:35.740
Did you... did you...

608
01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:39.500
Did you feel something there?

609
01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:43.540
Someone?

610
01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.260
Or just something.

611
01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:48.300
What made you say that?

612
01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:49.660
I don't know.

613
01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:55.180
Am I confusing you?

614
01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:57.860
No, it's, um...

615
01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:01.380
It's odd. It's the...

616
01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:03.180
It's the sort of thing
Patricia would say.


617
01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:05.820
It's bizarre.

618
01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:07.460
Come on.

619
01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:09.500
Let's get changed,
or Sonia will leave without us.


620
01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:10.700
I've got a dress you can wear.

621
01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:12.060
Double caposhi.

622
01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:28.660
Susie!

623
01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.460
Oh, Susie!

624
01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:56.340
BLANC: I want to bring in
a custom from the old ways.

625
01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:57.740
HULLER: What do you have in mind?

626
01:01:58.420 --> 01:01:59.860
BLANC: A witness.

627
01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:02.460
KAPLITT: One of our
new friends from the police?

628
01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:05.860
VENDEGAST: Why not one of
those young things at the window?

629
01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:08.580
HULLER: You're forgetting we already have a witness.

630
01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:11.580
The old man who sent us
the police in the first place.

631
01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.700
He will be our winess.

632
01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.780
TANNER: Yes. Not one of our girls.

633
01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:18.700
It would make any of them insane.

634
01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.380
BLANC: I agree

635
01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.300
And it's good for Susie
to see us like this.

636
01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:25.220
That we're still part of the world.

637
01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:29.300
VENDEGAST: Maybe she even senses
what we want of her.

638
01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:31.700
TANNER: She senses a lot.

639
01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:34.220
You can see her eyes shine with it.

640
01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:37.620
BLANC: I see it every night.

641
01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:39.540
When I send her our dreams.

642
01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:28.020
Is it true?

643
01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:02.100
Is it true?

644
01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:09.500
I know who I am!

645
01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.940
I know who I am!

646
01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:20.420
It's all right.

647
01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:21.580
It's okay.

648
01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:23.260
Is she all right?

649
01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:24.820
It's just a nightmare.

650
01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:26.540
The Markos Company special.

651
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.540
I'm surprised
it took this long.


652
01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:30.780
Hey, let me know
if she needs a Valium.


653
01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:40.900
She's right. I dreamt
of hairballs in toilets


654
01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:43.860
for three weeks before I got
a decent night of sleep here.


655
01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:46.700
Move over.

656
01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:01.220
I've only ever slept
in bed with my sister.


657
01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:02.980
We're sisters now.

658
01:05:55.700 --> 01:06:01.780
"In a statement released to the press
moments ago, the hijacker's leader "Martyrer Mahmud"

659
01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:09.900
demands Baader, Ensslin, 
Moeller and the other RAF prisoners be released from Stammheim prison and flown to Mogadishu."

660
01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:11.140
Good morning.

661
01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:18.620
I'd like to talk to
Detective Glockner or Detective Albrecht.

662
01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:19.940
Your name?

663
01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:21.860
Klemperer, josef.

664
01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:22.900
One moment.

665
01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:33.140
".. as proof of their intentions, the hijackers threw down
onto the tarmac, the body of the flights pilot Jurgen Schumann.

666
01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:35.580
He had been shot in the head.

667
01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:39.700
Agent Glockner's office is on the right.

668
01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:42.500
Have a seat there
and they'll call for you.

669
01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:57.580
"Terror suspect. 
Do you know this woman's name?"

670
01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:58.780
Mr. Klemperer?

671
01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:00.700
Please come inside.

672
01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:03.940
We were shown every room

673
01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.980
We didn't see anything worth remembering.

674
01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:11.500
They are professional performers.

675
01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:14.660
Illusion is their craft.

676
01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:17.420
It's not your place to speculate on that.

677
01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:27.060
Did you speak to the woman called Markos?

678
01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:28.980
Patricia referred to her as

679
01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:30.900
"Mother Markos."

680
01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:38.620
She had a delusion about
this woman leading a coven there.

681
01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:43.900
She had this delusion for months

682
01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:47.740
Do you believe in witches, Doctor?

683
01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:48.740
No.

684
01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:52.620
But I believe that...

685
01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:59.460
people can organize themselves to
perpetrate crimes and call it magic.

686
01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:02.540
That I can believe

687
01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:08.180
Do you understand the kind
of week we are having, Doctor?

688
01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.780
Detective Glockner!

689
01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:22.700
This isn't the first time we've met.

690
01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:27.780
You were on the police
force in Friedenau, weren't you?

691
01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:33.420
You helped me to
try to locate my wife.

692
01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:35.580
Your wife also went missing?

693
01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:39.820
Two years before the Russian charge.

694
01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:46.100
Ankle Meire. 1943.

695
01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:51.700
From the records, you
helped me cross off Poland.

696
01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:56.300
I'm still grateful.

697
01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.700
And one, and two, and three.

698
01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:09.980
And one, and two,
and three.


699
01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:12.420
And one, and two, and three.

700
01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:15.180
And one, and two,
and three.


701
01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:17.220
One, and two, and three.

702
01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:19.780
And one, and two, and three.

703
01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:22.140
And one, and two,
and three.


704
01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.420
And one, and two, and three.

705
01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:26.260
That's-that's okay.

706
01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:30.100
Do you want to do the jumps?

707
01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:33.420
Okay.

708
01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:35.220
And...

709
01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:37.580
one, and two, and three.

710
01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:40.220
And one, and two, and three.

711
01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:41.100
No.

712
01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.900
Elbows higher.

713
01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:44.220
All right, one moment.

714
01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.180
Susie, part of the jump
is muscle,


715
01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:48.540
and that will develop
as you condition,


716
01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:50.060
but you seem to have
an aversion to them,


717
01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.700
and I don't quite see why.

718
01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:53.500
Are you so happy
to be stuck to the earth?


719
01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:56.740
There's a yield
before the push,


720
01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.420
which I don't think
you're quite understanding.


721
01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:01.740
Caroline. Could you come and do
a series for us, please?


722
01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:18.260
Thank you.

723
01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:20.940
And now you.

724
01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.780
What I really want
is to be on...


725
01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:50.940
on the floor right now, anyway.

726
01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:52.500
Well, of course.

727
01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:54.900
That's because you're mistaking
physical weakness


728
01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:56.980
with artistic preference.

729
01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:58.780
And because you're tired.

730
01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:03.300
At this point,

731
01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.700
the jumps are opposing
the pull of the structure,


732
01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:08.060
but...

733
01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:09.900
it's soon for that,
don't you think?


734
01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:16.340
The floor work is... is keeping
the other dancers pushed down.


735
01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.980
So this...

736
01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:21.740
this could echo that...

737
01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:29.460
...on-on a slightly higher
point of elevation.


738
01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:33.740
If I stay close
to the ground now


739
01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:37.500
and go straight into the jumps
where you have them later,


740
01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:41.660
then that's more to the point.

741
01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:44.020
The resistance is more...

742
01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:46.140
emphatic.

743
01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:47.500
Right?

744
01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:55.540
I don't know how aware you are

745
01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:58.940
of what times we lived through
here 40 years ago.


746
01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:03.380
Out of which
this piece was made.


747
01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:07.460
We learned at great cost
through those years


748
01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:10.700
the value of the balance
of things.


749
01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:15.740
Every arrow that flies
feels the pull of the earth,


750
01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:19.500
but we must aim upwards.

751
01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:21.260
We need to get you in the air.

752
01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:41.140
Leave her, leave her,
leave her, leave her, leave...


753
01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:00.100
Oh, Caroline.

754
01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.460
Don't be afraid.

755
01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:05.220
Eveything will be arlight.

756
01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:06.860
Ja?

757
01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:15.260
She hit her head hard.

758
01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:16.820
I heard it. I hope...

759
01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:18.380
Miss..

760
01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:21.980
One moment please!

761
01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:30.300
I am... I'm looking for
a dancer from your company.


762
01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:32.740
Who are you looking for?

763
01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:34.460
You are Sara.

764
01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:38.700
Yes.

765
01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:39.820
May I help you?

766
01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:43.020
I am a friend from Patricia.

767
01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:48.340
"When the deadline arrived,
the hijackers informed the police

768
01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:52.900
they had poured all the
flight's duty-free alcohol over the hostages

769
01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:54.820
and were set to ignite them.

770
01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:57.740
But when they were
told the West German Government

771
01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:00.020
was in the process of
releasing the terrorists from Stammheim prison,

772
01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:04.060
they agreed to extend
the deadline to after midnight."

773
01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:06.260
I don't know what
to make of any of this.


774
01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:08.020
I know the kind of thing
she was involved with,


775
01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:09.460
but I can't see how any of this

776
01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:11.700
could be happening
inside the company.


777
01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:15.220
Well, she describes...

778
01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:18.220
something like
a revolutionary organization


779
01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:20.940
in a crisis of leadership.

780
01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:24.020
With Markos very ill...

781
01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:27.300
I live there.

782
01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:28.660
I have friends there.

783
01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:30.820
I don't see any evidence
of this at all.


784
01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:32.260
No one has ever approached me

785
01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:34.100
or any of the other girls,
as far as I know.


786
01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:37.020
Read this.

787
01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:38.100
What is this?

788
01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:40.140
This is Patricia's diary.

789
01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:43.820
Mother Markos.

790
01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:47.020
Mother Meinhof.

791
01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:48.460
The dance rehearsal.

792
01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:49.940
Political action.

793
01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:51.900
These two areas
in Patricia's life


794
01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:55.140
were of equal importance.

795
01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:57.900
This is how
transference happens,


796
01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:01.260
how delusion is made.

797
01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:02.940
Delusion, Sara,

798
01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:06.620
is a lie that tells a truth.

799
01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:08.860
-This says "witches."
-Mmm.


800
01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:14.940
Maybe Patricia's fantasies
about witches,


801
01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:20.500
they are her way of processing
some other form of intrigue.


802
01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:25.820
The company's a family.

803
01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:27.740
There's a lot of love there.

804
01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:29.380
Love and manipulation--

805
01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:33.660
they... they share houses
very often.


806
01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:36.380
They are frequent bedfellows.

807
01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:38.300
Sorry, I don't see this.

808
01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:43.820
Eat.

809
01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:46.940
Eat.

810
01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:58.220
Only...

811
01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:01.140
maybe the police,
they missed something.


812
01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:06.300
And Patricia,
she did spoke of...


813
01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:09.540
whole hidden areas
of the building.


814
01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:12.660
Actual rooms that are secret.

815
01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.380
I don't want
to be disrespectful--


816
01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:22.820
I don't--
but you're asking me,


817
01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.780
-and I'm telling you...
-Oh, please.


818
01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:26.100
It's a dance company.

819
01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:28.140
We're not talking
about anything else.


820
01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:29.820
Sara.

821
01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:33.220
Please, only look closer.

822
01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:34.500
Thank you for caring
for Patricia,


823
01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:36.300
but I hope
you don't come again.


824
01:16:58.420 --> 01:16:59.580
-Good night.
-Good night.


825
01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:01.300
Sara, hurry up.

826
01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:03.700
I'm tired. I need the bathroom.

827
01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:08.780
-Good night, Doll.
-Good night.


828
01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:20.220
She hasn't come back yet?

829
01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:28.300
Maybe she's seeing somebody.

830
01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:34.580
Part of the issue always

831
01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:37.060
is not being able
to see your body in space.


832
01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:41.660
One angle in one mirror
or on film is not enough.


833
01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:43.300
Movement is never mute.

834
01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:44.900
It is a language.

835
01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.540
It's a series
of energetic shapes...


836
01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:48.220
...written in the air

837
01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:51.340
like words forming sentences.

838
01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.900
Like poems.

839
01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:55.540
Like prayers.

840
01:17:58.540 --> 01:17:59.780
Spells?

841
01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:05.740
When you jump,
it's not the height


842
01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:08.260
but the space beneath you
that matters.


843
01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:11.060
Every leap into the air
must be a coup de foudre.


844
01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:17.820
I don't understand.

845
01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:20.620
A strike of lightning.

846
01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.860
A bolt of love, in fact.

847
01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:28.380
That's beautiful.

848
01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:31.740
There are two things
that dance can never be again:


849
01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:34.660
beautiful and cheerful.

850
01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:36.620
Today, we need
to break the nose


851
01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:38.860
of every beautiful thing.

852
01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:40.420
And if you're going
to be a dancer,


853
01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:42.420
you must learn French.

854
01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:44.860
Try not to worry.

855
01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:47.140
Blanc is working on the new approach,

856
01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:50.420
How could we have known
what would happen with Patricia?

857
01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:53.700
What we are attempting hasn't
been done in living memory.

858
01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:57.260
How do we know
it will work at all?

859
01:18:57.260 --> 01:18:59.580
If it killed that girl

860
01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:02.540
it may kill any girl we try.

861
01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:03.580
She is not wrong.

862
01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:05.420
Patricia was unwilling in the end.

863
01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:07.340
Blanc believes that was the reason.

864
01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:09.660
We should not have forced it.

865
01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:11.500
She did not want to be a vessel.

866
01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.580
We wanted to bring her into our power

867
01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:16.300
but she wanted to
blow up departments stores intead.

868
01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:18.060
What a fool, that girl.

869
01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:20.580
When you dance
the dance of another,


870
01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:24.620
you make yourself
in the image of its creator.


871
01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:25.940
You empty yourself

872
01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:27.540
so that her work can live
within you.


873
01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:28.940
Do you understand?

874
01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:32.220
Yeah.

875
01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:33.500
You're in a company now.

876
01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:34.940
You have to find
your right place.


877
01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:36.460
You have to decide--

878
01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:39.700
what is it you want to be
for this company?


879
01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:41.620
Is it the head?

880
01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:43.420
The spine?

881
01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:45.500
The sex?

882
01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:46.820
The heart?

883
01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:48.140
The hands.

884
01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:52.940
I want to be
this company's hands.


885
01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:59.300
Higher.

886
01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:01.140
Higher. Higher.

887
01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:03.900
Higher.

888
01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:06.100
Higher! Higher.

889
01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:07.620
Higher.

890
01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:12.340
Higher, higher, higher.

891
01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:13.580
Higher.

892
01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:19.740
Higher.

893
01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:22.700
Higher. Higher.

894
01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:26.460
Higher. Higher. Higher.

895
01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:35.060
Sometimes I only need
to be told twice.


896
01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:49.260
How do we know no one's
planning to blow us up, too?

897
01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:52.660
Patricia might have said
anything to anyone about us.

898
01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:54.580
As she did with the old man.

899
01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:56.660
You are right.

900
01:20:56.660 --> 01:20:58.580
We cannot despair.

901
01:20:58.580 --> 01:20:59.780
We have time.

902
01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:01.780
How much time?

903
01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:05.420
If Mother dies before
Blanc can deliver us Susie

904
01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:07.340
this company is finished.

905
01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:10.380
Markos will hold on, for us.

906
01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:12.420
You've seen her.

907
01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:15.540
Her body's a prison!

908
01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:19.220
Disease is on top of disease

909
01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:20.980
How long she can possibly..

910
01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:34.100
33, 34, 35, 36,

911
01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:37.420
37, 38, 39,

912
01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:39.100
40, 41.

913
01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:46.220
57, 58, 59,

914
01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:49.020
60, 61, 62, 63.

915
01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:01.580
65, 64, 63, 62.

916
01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:12.340
23, 22, 21.

917
01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:27.340
Ten, nine, eight,

918
01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.060
seven, six.

919
01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:31.380
Two, one.

920
01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:12.660
We couldn't stop her!

921
01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:14.780
She was too fast with knife!

922
01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:18.380
She's cold.

923
01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:23.580
Come with me! Quickly!

924
01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:43.620
Patricia wrote about

925
01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:47.060
"Three Mothers" lost in time,

926
01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:51.420
predating all Christian
invention.


927
01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:54.780
Pre
-God. Pre
-Devil.

928
01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:58.860
Mother Tenebrarum,
Mother Lachrymarum


929
01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:01.420
and Mother Suspiriorum.

930
01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:06.860
Darkness, Tears and Sighs.

931
01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:10.060
I saw images of that
last night.


932
01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:12.580
In porcelain,
these very fine things.


933
01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:14.100
You can tell they have money.

934
01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:21.100
Patricia said that, uh, Markos

935
01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:23.540
claims to be one of the Three.

936
01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:26.300
But there is dissent
amongst them.


937
01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:31.300
She wrote about "Markosites"
and "Blancites."


938
01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:34.620
In
-Internal division.

939
01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:36.780
Madame Blanc's
involved in this?


940
01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:46.340
Do they believe
they're witches?


941
01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:51.740
You can give someone
your delusion, Sara.


942
01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:53.140
That's religion.

943
01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:57.300
That was the Reich.

944
01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:00.540
The Reich had these things.

945
01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:04.100
Insignia.

946
01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:07.100
Esoteric ritual.

947
01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:10.300
These "Mothers," yeah,
they could be


948
01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:13.660
code names for founding members

949
01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:16.100
with metaphoric histories.

950
01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:18.460
I don't know.

951
01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:23.100
But I do know you are living
with dangerous people.


952
01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:25.340
Patricia could still be in...

953
01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:26.420
...in there.

954
01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:32.420
They could be holding her.

955
01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:34.140
In the building.

956
01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:36.340
Well, I cannot promise
that the authorities


957
01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:39.340
will come back to, uh,
inspect a cabinet


958
01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:43.740
full of porcelain
after all that has happened.


959
01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:46.060
But we can try.

960
01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:49.860
And in the meantime, you must,
uh, take care of yourself.


961
01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:51.860
Perhaps you should leave.

962
01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:53.460
You have somewhere you can go?

963
01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:57.980
I'll figure it out.

964
01:28:58.140 --> 01:29:00.820
And I think you should
put this back.


965
01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:02.820
Or better still,
you leave it here.


966
01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:06.860
Not good for them
to know that you have it.


967
01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:38.300
Is anyone among you sick?

968
01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:40.980
Let him call for the elders
of the church;


969
01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:43.420
and let them pray over him,

970
01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:46.980
anointing him with oil
in the name of the Lord.


971
01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:52.300
And the prayer of faith
shall save him that is sick,


972
01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:55.340
and the Lord
shall raise him up;


973
01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:59.460
and if he has committed sins...

974
01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:01.460
My daughter.

975
01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:06.220
...they shall be forgiven him.

976
01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:11.940
My last one.

977
01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:17.540
She's my sin.

978
01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:20.660
She's what I smeared
on the world.


979
01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:31.980
First of all it's very
important, do you remember this?

980
01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:37.180
You must use your center.

981
01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:39.420
and you must create a space.

982
01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:42.860
Now I understand.

983
01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:44.860
Wait, wait.

984
01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:47.020
Alright.

985
01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:51.820
Suspended, suspended in the air.

986
01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:53.900
Remember to create space.

987
01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:55.820
Yes, I understand.

988
01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:03.580
You're making some kind
of deal with them.


989
01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:05.980
I don't know
what you're talking about.


990
01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:08.820
How can you know

991
01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:10.380
what they're going
to ask you in return?


992
01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:13.500
Sara, whatever you have
in your mind,


993
01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:16.820
nothing is wrong.

994
01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:18.740
You just haven't
seen the bill yet.


995
01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:22.340
Nothing's wrong.

996
01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:35.420
"Special forces of the German Federal Police stromed Lufthansa 181 in the night and killed
three of the four hijackers ending five days of terror for the passenger of the flight.

997
01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:47.100
In the morning, in the high-security wing of the Stuutgart
-Stammheim prison, three of the five RAF prisoners were discovered dead in an apparent suicide pact made upon hearing of the news from Mogadishu.

998
01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:55.620
Protesters are congregating around the Germany

999
01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:59.660
chanting that the prisoners were instead assassinated.

1000
01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:07.660
Federal Police President Horst Herold, went so far as to declare '<i>The Baader
-Meinoff era is done'."</i>

1001
01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:20.380
What's the matter with you?

1002
01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:22.180
Huh?

1003
01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:30.780
You don't be so afraid
about the white, Susie.


1004
01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:34.140
They need to see you
from the very back row.


1005
01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:43.500
Where is Sara?

1006
01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:47.260
She came early in the morning,

1007
01:33:47.420 --> 01:33:49.260
did her makeup and left.

1008
01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:53.180
Good evening, welcome.

1009
01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:57.500
First time here, isn't it?

1010
01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:00.660
Please, come.

1011
01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:11.580
Yes, thank you. Have fun.

1012
01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:13.500
Straight ahead.

1013
01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:39.500
Girls!

1014
01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:41.660
Vier minuten!

1015
01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:43.100
Four minutes!

1016
01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:48.780
Vier minuten!

1017
01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:50.580
Tak, tak.

1018
01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:32.220
Is it true?

1019
01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:33.300
Sara.

1020
01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:36.300
Sara.

1021
01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:37.820
Patricia.

1022
01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:41.940
Patricia. Patricia.

1023
01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:44.500
-I knew it.
-They'll kill him.


1024
01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:46.460
I'm sorry it took me so long.

1025
01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:48.500
I'm so sorry.

1026
01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:50.660
What did they do to you?

1027
01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:53.180
I wake up here every day.

1028
01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:55.060
It's all over now.
I'll get you out.


1029
01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:57.700
The performance
is starting upstairs.


1030
01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:00.420
Everyone will be looking
the other way.


1031
01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:02.900
Get up. Get up.

1032
01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:04.140
Patricia!

1033
01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:07.420
-Patricia, get up.
-I'm trying.


1034
01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:08.700
Get up.

1035
01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:23.380
Get it off of me!

1036
01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:24.860
Sara!

1037
01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:59.980
Markos! Markos! Markos! Markos!

1038
01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:13.060
Good evening!

1039
01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:18.020
We created this piece in 1948.

1040
01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:21.820
Marketa.

1041
01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:23.380
Where is Sara?

1042
01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:24.300
Sara?

1043
01:37:24.460 --> 01:37:25.500
I don't know.

1044
01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:27.380
-Is she upstairs?
-No. I looked.


1045
01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:29.540
Just dance
as if she's with you.


1046
01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:39.900
Sara!

1047
01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:50.420
This is the last
time we are performing it.

1048
01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:55.220
The Markos Dance Company presents

1049
01:37:55.660 --> 01:37:56.420
Volk!

1050
01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:01.900
Go!

1051
01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:53.940
My darling..

1052
01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:56.300
-No.
-Sara, lie still.


1053
01:39:56.460 --> 01:39:58.300
- No!
- Sara.


1054
01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:04.860
Please. Please...

1055
01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:12.180
No! No!

1056
01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:12.380
The girl is ready, Blanc.

1057
01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:13.820
It's time.

1058
01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:10.500
Please, remain seated!

1059
01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:11.300
Stay calm and seated!

1060
01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:12.060
Sara!

1061
01:44:55.780 --> 01:44:56.980
Good.

1062
01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:58.820
Good. That's good.

1063
01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:13.860
I'm sorry I went off book.

1064
01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:22.060
This can't happen again.

1065
01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:26.300
You're only just starting
to understand, Susie.


1066
01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:27.940
We brought Sara back upstairs

1067
01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:30.300
to try to complete
the performance in time,


1068
01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:32.940
but then you derailed it.

1069
01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:35.060
Did I hurt those people?

1070
01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:36.540
Not this time.

1071
01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:37.980
They saw a dance.

1072
01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:39.100
That's all.

1073
01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:44.180
It's all a mess, isn't it?

1074
01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:46.380
The one out there.

1075
01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:48.020
The one in here.

1076
01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:52.260
The one that's coming.

1077
01:46:56.540 --> 01:46:58.860
Why is everyone

1078
01:46:59.020 --> 01:47:01.580
so ready to think
the worst is over?


1079
01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:21.900
I could
explain everything to you.


1080
01:47:24.220 --> 01:47:26.500
I think it would be wrong,
though.


1081
01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:34.860
You don't want to make me choose.

1082
01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:37.180
Because you love me.

1083
01:47:41.940 --> 01:47:43.500
Close your eyes.

1084
01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:49.380
No more dreams tonight.

1085
01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:55.300
I'll make sure of it.

1086
01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:02.540
One, two, three, four.

1087
01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:06.420
One, two, three, four.

1088
01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:10.340
One, two, three, four.

1089
01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:17.740
Tonight.

1090
01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:20.980
It must happen tonight.

1091
01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:31.180
Herr Doktor.

1092
01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:33.460
But Doctor, the soup is ready!

1093
01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:02.740
You can eat and drink

1094
01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:04.100
all that you want!

1095
01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:53.900
Who's there?

1096
01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:14.900
Josef?

1097
01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:21.060
Anke?

1098
01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:36.060
Karol told them about us.

1099
01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:40.260
I had only a
few minutes to get out.

1100
01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:46.980
I got the apartment,
but my papers were'n't anywhere.

1101
01:52:48.900 --> 01:52:52.100
Then I traveled by foot to Teplitz.

1102
01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:54.980
where I planned to ask
Mireks family to take me in.

1103
01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:57.580
But I was caught at the border

1104
01:52:58.060 --> 01:53:00.380
and taken to Terezin Camp

1105
01:53:00.660 --> 01:53:03.980
No one believed me that
I was born in Gartz.

1106
01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:08.860
After the liberation I made my way Zurich

1107
01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:10.780
and then to Bristol.

1108
01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:13.620
I've made

1109
01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:17.740
a new life there

1110
01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:21.020
A lovely life.

1111
01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:24.900
I was told

1112
01:53:25.260 --> 01:53:28.020
you'd died in the invasion.

1113
01:56:21.380 --> 01:56:23.740
Look how dirty he made it!

1114
01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:26.380
Have a pity!

1115
01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:29.020
What reason is there to pity you?

1116
01:56:29.020 --> 01:56:32.540
You had years to get
your wife out of Berlin

1117
01:56:32.740 --> 01:56:34.940
before the arrests began.

1118
01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:38.420
When women tell you the truth

1119
01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:40.340
You don't pity them

1120
01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:44.100
You tell them they have delusions!

1121
01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:18.180
I'm not guilty...

1122
01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:22.660
I am innocent!

1123
01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:27.380
I remember!

1124
01:59:28.340 --> 01:59:31.500
I am innocent!

1125
01:59:36.140 --> 01:59:38.540
Are there guilty men in Berlin?

1126
01:59:38.980 --> 01:59:40.300
Everywhere!

1127
01:59:41.740 --> 01:59:44.900
But I am not one of them!

1128
01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:51.020
I'm ready, Madame.

1129
02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:17.620
You look afraid.

1130
02:00:19.940 --> 02:00:21.780
She's afraid for you.

1131
02:00:37.340 --> 02:00:40.940
There will be nothing of you

1132
02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:44.780
left inside.

1133
02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:50.300
Only space for me.

1134
02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:52.820
I came here for this.

1135
02:00:55.380 --> 02:00:56.740
You've all waited long enough.

1136
02:00:56.900 --> 02:00:58.900
Ah!

1137
02:00:59.060 --> 02:01:01.820
It is happening.

1138
02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:05.060
It is happening!

1139
02:01:46.420 --> 02:01:49.900
Do you come here willingly?

1140
02:01:50.060 --> 02:01:51.740
Hmm?

1141
02:01:52.860 --> 02:01:53.740
Huh?

1142
02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:55.580
You must have no doubts, Susie.

1143
02:01:55.740 --> 02:01:57.980
If you do, I can take you back.

1144
02:01:58.140 --> 02:02:00.580
I can take all of this
from your head.


1145
02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:02.780
You can forget everything.

1146
02:02:05.100 --> 02:02:08.140
I want this to be pure.

1147
02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:12.180
We all know what you want.

1148
02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:19.300
This isn't vanity.

1149
02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:22.100
This isn't...

1150
02:02:22.260 --> 02:02:24.100
art!

1151
02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:28.180
There is something wrong here.

1152
02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:29.420
Can you not feel it?

1153
02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:31.500
This is not right.

1154
02:02:31.660 --> 02:02:32.780
We have to stop this now.

1155
02:02:32.940 --> 02:02:35.500
We have been on

1156
02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:37.620
two sides of this

1157
02:02:37.780 --> 02:02:39.540
for too long now.

1158
02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:42.140
Markos! Markos! Markos!

1159
02:02:42.300 --> 02:02:45.820
Markos! Markos!
Markos! Markos!


1160
02:02:45.980 --> 02:02:48.260
Markos! Markos! Markos!

1161
02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:50.020
Markos! Markos!

1162
02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:52.300
Markos! Markos! Markos!

1163
02:02:52.460 --> 02:02:54.700
Markos! Markos!

1164
02:03:24.620 --> 02:03:28.020
If you accept me,

1165
02:03:28.180 --> 02:03:33.060
you must put down
the woman who bore you.


1166
02:03:35.340 --> 02:03:38.420
Think of that false mother now.

1167
02:03:50.740 --> 02:03:53.900
Reject her.

1168
02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:55.900
Expel her.

1169
02:03:59.540 --> 02:04:05.340
You have the only mother
you need here.


1170
02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:08.380
Death to any other mother.

1171
02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:08.980
Say it.

1172
02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:13.740
Death to any other mother.

1173
02:04:43.380 --> 02:04:45.020
Who are you?

1174
02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:53.740
For whom were you anointed?

1175
02:04:53.900 --> 02:04:56.500
Which of the Three Mothers?

1176
02:04:56.660 --> 02:04:58.540
Mother...

1177
02:05:03.300 --> 02:05:06.220
Mother Suspiriorum.

1178
02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:11.420
I am she.

1179
02:05:48.380 --> 02:05:49.380
Markos.

1180
02:06:03.620 --> 02:06:04.500
Markos!

1181
02:06:39.300 --> 02:06:40.300
Markos!

1182
02:06:42.340 --> 02:06:43.340
Markos.

1183
02:06:50.180 --> 02:06:53.180
Death to any other mother.

1184
02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:54.460
Markos.

1185
02:07:01.300 --> 02:07:02.220
Markos!

1186
02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:14.740
Markos!

1187
02:07:22.220 --> 02:07:23.340
Markos!

1188
02:08:10.140 --> 02:08:14.620
I am the Mother.

1189
02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:37.540
What do you ask?

1190
02:08:37.700 --> 02:08:38.980
To die.

1191
02:08:43.100 --> 02:08:45.060
Mother.

1192
02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:46.820
Mother, we're so tired.

1193
02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:56.460
What do you ask?

1194
02:08:56.620 --> 02:08:58.700
To die.

1195
02:08:58.860 --> 02:09:00.220
I want to die.

1196
02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:11.020
Sweet girl.

1197
02:09:13.220 --> 02:09:14.820
What do you ask?

1198
02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:19.340
Die.

1199
02:09:45.580 --> 02:09:48.100
Dance. Dance.

1200
02:09:48.260 --> 02:09:50.540
Keep dancing.

1201
02:09:50.700 --> 02:09:52.260
It's beautiful.

1202
02:09:53.420 --> 02:09:55.060
It's beautiful.

1203
02:09:56.340 --> 02:09:58.260
It's beautiful.

1204
02:11:10.020 --> 02:11:11.500
Watch your step,

1205
02:11:14.260 --> 02:11:15.980
It's been snowing.

1206
02:11:16.260 --> 02:11:17.900
Everything is pretty.

1207
02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:21.260
And again, slowly.

1208
02:11:21.780 --> 02:11:23.580
Yeah. Okay.

1209
02:11:23.740 --> 02:11:25.540
Good. Good.

1210
02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:36.860
Good evening, good night

1211
02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:43.740
with roses covered

1212
02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:48.300
with cloves adorned

1213
02:11:49.180 --> 02:11:53.420
slip under the covers.

1214
02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:58.700
Tomorrow morning, if God wills

1215
02:11:58.940 --> 02:12:03.340
you will wake once again.

1216
02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:18.260
My God, what a night.

1217
02:13:18.420 --> 02:13:20.900
I definitely drank
too much wine.


1218
02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:24.340
And what about the
song of Tanner and Balfour?

1219
02:13:24.460 --> 02:13:25.740
It was fantastic!

1220
02:13:25.740 --> 02:13:27.660
Yes, I adore it!

1221
02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:36.180
-Bonjour.
-Bonjour.


1222
02:13:39.980 --> 02:13:41.940
-Guten Morgen.
-Morning.


1223
02:13:42.100 --> 02:13:43.220
Good morning.

1224
02:13:43.940 --> 02:13:47.140
Girls, I need you to listen.

1225
02:13:47.140 --> 02:13:51.660
I have such a sad news and I
want you to be brave when you hear it.

1226
02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:54.500
Madame Blanc has left the company.

1227
02:14:19.820 --> 02:14:22.340
Be brave girls!

1228
02:14:36.580 --> 02:14:39.860
"aryan papers"

1229
02:15:12.180 --> 02:15:14.340
This is not the
way to do it, Doctor.

1230
02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:18.500
I nearly called the police myself.

1231
02:15:18.700 --> 02:15:22.020
You haven't been well, I know.

1232
02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:26.500
Who are you? How
did you get in here?

1233
02:15:26.780 --> 02:15:28.100
Wait outside.

1234
02:15:54.020 --> 02:15:56.420
I regret what my daughters
did to you.


1235
02:15:58.780 --> 02:16:00.780
I wasn't in a position
to prevent it.


1236
02:16:05.900 --> 02:16:08.260
I believe you deserve
to know the truth.


1237
02:16:17.140 --> 02:16:21.580
Your wife did try
to make it south


1238
02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:23.180
to Teplice.

1239
02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:28.980
She was apprehended
by border guards


1240
02:16:29.140 --> 02:16:32.140
in the woods
just outside of Glashuütte.


1241
02:16:35.340 --> 02:16:40.140
She was then taken
to Theresienstadt camp.


1242
02:16:42.740 --> 02:16:45.100
She lived there for 20 days.

1243
02:16:46.940 --> 02:16:51.780
On the 11th of November, 1943,

1244
02:16:51.940 --> 02:16:56.020
the commandant of the camp,
a man named Burger...


1245
02:16:57.540 --> 02:17:00.260
...ordered all 40,000
detained there


1246
02:17:00.420 --> 02:17:04.900
stand outside in the cold
for a census.


1247
02:17:10.820 --> 02:17:12.780
Hours and hours passed.

1248
02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:18.500
Some hundreds died of exposure.

1249
02:17:27.300 --> 02:17:29.740
Your wife had two women
with her as she died.


1250
02:17:32.100 --> 02:17:35.540
Women she had befriended,

1251
02:17:35.700 --> 02:17:38.260
who made her feel
that she was not alone.


1252
02:17:45.380 --> 02:17:48.940
Her final thoughts...

1253
02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:52.500
were of a birthday

1254
02:17:52.660 --> 02:17:56.460
when you took her
to a concert as a surprise.


1255
02:17:56.620 --> 02:17:59.060
Chopin and Brahms.

1256
02:18:03.380 --> 02:18:05.500
It was the first time
you held her hand.


1257
02:18:11.380 --> 02:18:14.020
She was cold when she died.

1258
02:18:17.380 --> 02:18:18.820
But she wasn't afraid.

1259
02:18:23.220 --> 02:18:25.340
She was thinking only of you.

1260
02:18:44.140 --> 02:18:45.940
Of Anke Meier...

1261
02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:49.940
...of Patricia Hingle...

1262
02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:53.220
...of Sara Simms...

1263
02:18:57.060 --> 02:19:00.340
...of Susanna Bannion,

1264
02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:03.700
of all the women
of your undoing...


1265
02:19:06.620 --> 02:19:09.220
...every memory will vanish.

1266
02:19:13.340 --> 02:19:16.740
They will melt away in the sun

1267
02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:18.060
and be gone.

1268
02:19:20.980 --> 02:19:24.260
We need guilt,

1269
02:19:25.140 --> 02:19:26.380
Doctor.

1270
02:19:28.300 --> 02:19:30.060
And shame

1271
02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:33.420
But not yours.

1272
02:19:46.900 --> 02:19:48.660
Herr Doktor.

1273
02:19:48.820 --> 02:19:51.340
Herr Doktor.

1274
02:20:01.580 --> 02:20:02.860
Who are you?

1275
02:20:03.180 --> 02:20:04.460
Miss Sesame!

1276
02:20:06.220 --> 02:20:08.180
-Ja?
-Ja.
