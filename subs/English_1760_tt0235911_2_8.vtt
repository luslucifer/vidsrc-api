Somebody do something!

Now! Do you hear me?!

Now!

25
00:01:08.893 --> 00:01:09.991
Relax, Courtney...

26
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.024
I think she just wants
her pillows fluffed.


27
00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:14.924
That was going to be
my second guess.


28
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.391
I hope these cheer
you up, Mrs. Gripling.

That's so sweet
of you, Ginger.


31

Nothing says "Sorry
about the botched

32
00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:26.758
like daisies and
pink rosebuds.


33
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.225
I can't believe

34
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.558
they bungled a simple facelift.

35
00:01:30.727 --> 00:01:32.924
Actually, the facelift
isn't the problem;


36
00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:35.024
it's the<i>infection</i>
from the facelift


37
00:01:35.193 --> 00:01:36.692
that we got to keep
an eye on.


38
00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:38.124
But she's going
to be just fine.


39
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.024
Well, Mumma, I hope you've
learned your lesson.


40
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.824

Oh, please... just
two more minutes?


44
00:01:51.427 --> 00:01:54.458
All right...
but only two.

00:02:01.893 --> 00:02:03.225
Got to run some errands.

50
00:02:04.393 --> 00:02:06.158
Oh... do you really need me to?

51
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.525
I wanted to meet up
with Dodie and Macie.


52

Oh, well...

53
00:02:10.627 --> 00:02:12.024
I just feel like
we've been doing

00:02:12.126 --> 00:02:16.491

You better come
quick, Mrs. Foutley.


61

Now she's in pain.

62
00:02:27.527 --> 00:02:28.325
What happened?

63
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.258
She just found out

64
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.692
this isn't
a private room.

Talk about your

It's only a plastic

for cryin' out loud.

73

Yeah, and what's with

and choppy editing?

75
00:02:57.227 --> 00:02:58.891
It's like they're
trying to create

00:02:59.026 --> 00:03:00.258
the illusion of tension

77
00:03:00.327 --> 00:03:02.757
when he's probably just
going in for a nose job.

TV ANNOUNCER:
Today on<i>Ultra Plastic Surgery,</i>
chin implants.


82
00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:16.258
Chin
implants?!
Chin
implants?!


83
00:03:16.726 --> 00:03:17.924
Yes, I have to say

84
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.824
chin implants are
very popular right now.


85
00:03:20.993 --> 00:03:25.191
And, as you know,
the chin makes the man...


86
00:03:25.327 --> 00:03:26.425
especially mine.

(<i>voice echoing</i> )

I could be wrong here, Hoods,

89
00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.525
but my chin isn't a whole
lot like Dr. Juan's.


90
00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.258
Should I be worried?

91
00:03:35.393 --> 00:03:36.491
Who cares?!

92
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.525
They're bringing out
the surgical drill!

(<i>man yelling in pain</i> )

This is guaranteed
to tighten the pores


95
00:03:42.826 --> 00:03:44.358
and moisturize the skin.

96
00:03:44.493 --> 00:03:45.592
Plus, if we get hungry,

97
00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:46.858
all we need are some chips

98
00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:48.558
and we've got ourselves a snack.

they don't grow
frozen vegetables

Mrs. Foutley?

They grow them

103

Hey, Courtney.

You know, I don't
always look like this.


109
00:04:06.726 --> 00:04:09.091
Did you go to the store
with my mom?


110

Mm-hmm.

111
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.924
Visiting hours were over

112
00:04:10.993 --> 00:04:12.624
and Miranda had
a clarinet lesson


113
00:04:12.726 --> 00:04:14.291
and, well, I didn't
want to go home,


114
00:04:14.427 --> 00:04:16.724
so I went grocery shopping
with your mother!


115
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.624
And I was a big help,
wasn't I?


116
00:04:18.793 --> 00:04:19.924
You sure were.

117
00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:22.491
Courtney here stuck
her hand all the way


118
00:04:22.626 --> 00:04:24.291
into the back
of the freezer


119
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.491
to get the last
bag of succotash.


120
00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:29.858
Well... I would've
gone with you, Mom.


121
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.724
You should've asked.

122
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.791
I did.

123
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.225
But you said you
had something to do


124
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.225
with Dodie and Macie.

125
00:04:35.293 --> 00:04:37.458
Only avocado masks--
no biggie.


126
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.624
I must say, Ginger,

127
00:04:38.693 --> 00:04:40.391
you missed out
on tremendous fun.


128
00:04:40.527 --> 00:04:43.691
Now I know why they
call them supermarkets.


129

(<i>car horn toots</i> )

130
00:04:45.093 --> 00:04:46.858
Oh, Winston's here already?

131
00:04:46.993 --> 00:04:48.191
Oh, pooh.

132
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.058
Now I won't get
to put away the groceries.


133
00:04:51.193 --> 00:04:53.225
Oh, well,
maybe next time.


134

Ta-ta,
everyone!


135
00:04:55.593 --> 00:04:56.558
You know,
girls,


136
00:04:56.626 --> 00:04:58.691
it's like
I've got
a sixth sense.


137
00:04:58.826 --> 00:04:59.757

everyone likes

I don't suppose

you gents
happened to catch


141
00:05:13.826 --> 00:05:17.291
yesterday's episode of
<i>Ultra Plastic Surgery?</i>


142
00:05:17.427 --> 00:05:18.757
Listen, Blakey,
we're the ones


143
00:05:18.826 --> 00:05:22.124
with the autographed picture
of Dr. Juan, not you.


144
00:05:22.293 --> 00:05:24.491
In other words,
we never miss it.


145
00:05:24.626 --> 00:05:25.624
It's true, of course.

146
00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.924
The chin does,
indeed, make the man.


147
00:05:28.026 --> 00:05:30.458
In fact, Wall Street
and Washington, D.C.,


148

have never been
without a Gripling chin.


149
00:05:33.026 --> 00:05:35.358
And it's one I shall
undoubtedly inherit.


150
00:05:35.526 --> 00:05:38.358
My father has it...
his father had it...


151
00:05:38.493 --> 00:05:39.924
his father's
father had it.


152
00:05:39.993 --> 00:05:43.458
Since when is a strong chin
a surefire sign of success?


153
00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:45.124
Yeah... you know,
unless you call


154
00:05:45.227 --> 00:05:49.258
being able to keep
a turtleneck from
riding up "success."


155
00:05:49.393 --> 00:05:50.757
Well, if you don't believe me,

take a stroll over
to the nearest newsstand


157

and see what kind of chins land

158
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.924
on the covers of important
news and business weeklies.


159
00:05:59.026 --> 00:05:59.891
Yeah, right.

160
00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.591
Like I got the time.

161
00:06:01.726 --> 00:06:03.058
I see your point...

or, perhaps,
the lack of one?


163
00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:08.891
Don't let him get
to you, Carl.


164
00:06:09.026 --> 00:06:11.757
It's Blake, for
cryin' out loud.


165
00:06:11.893 --> 00:06:12.791
Carl?

166
00:06:12.926 --> 00:06:14.258
Carl?!

167
00:06:15.826 --> 00:06:16.924
CARL:
I don't know...


168
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.891
maybe Gripling's
on to something.


169
00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:21.325
Ha! That's
totally lame.


170
00:06:21.427 --> 00:06:22.657
You rule Lucky
Elementary.


171
00:06:22.793 --> 00:06:25.524
It's written all over
the boy's bathroom.


172
00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:27.358
That's 'cause we wrote it.

173
00:06:27.492 --> 00:06:28.891
Anyway...
sure, I rule now.


174
00:06:29.026 --> 00:06:30.258
But what about
down the road?


175
00:06:30.427 --> 00:06:33.191
Say when Gripling finally
sprouts that chin


176
00:06:33.327 --> 00:06:35.358
he's been yapping about?

177
00:06:35.993 --> 00:06:37.291
Mmm, I don't know, Carl.

178
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.924
If you get a chin implant,
you'll look... different.


179
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.291
You'd get used to it.

180
00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:44.158
No... no,
I wouldn't, Carl.


181
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.757
I'm totally, like,
a creature of habit.


182
00:06:46.926 --> 00:06:51.391
My Mom uses 2% low-fat milk
instead of 1%, and I spaz.


183
00:06:51.526 --> 00:06:52.457
I'm talkin' ugly, Carl,

184
00:06:52.526 --> 00:06:55.724
'cause I can taste
the difference.


185
00:06:55.826 --> 00:06:57.624
My mind's
made up, Hoods.


186
00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:58.891
I'm going to do it.

187
00:06:59.026 --> 00:07:00.724
Carl, didn't you hear me?

188
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.557
I said I can taste
the difference!


189
00:07:08.893 --> 00:07:10.124
I really want
to thank you


190
00:07:10.293 --> 00:07:13.457
for sticking by me in
my hour of need, Ginger.


191
00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:15.858
Hospitals are
incredibly upsetting.


192
00:07:15.993 --> 00:07:17.724
(<i>man coughing violently</i> )

193
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.058
Do there have to be
so many sick people?


194
00:07:20.193 --> 00:07:22.358
Even Miranda wouldn't
come with me,


195
00:07:22.492 --> 00:07:23.657
and she loves misery.

196
00:07:23.826 --> 00:07:24.624
It's no big deal.

197
00:07:24.793 --> 00:07:25.824
Macie had band practice

198
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.225
and Dodie's at
a dentist appointment.


199
00:07:28.327 --> 00:07:30.524
I'll catch up
with them later.


200
00:07:30.693 --> 00:07:31.457
Well...

201
00:07:31.593 --> 00:07:32.691
(<i>gasps</i> )

202
00:07:32.826 --> 00:07:34.557
What the...?!

203
00:07:35.227 --> 00:07:36.591
Mumma?

204
00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:40.124
Mumma?!

205
00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:41.557
Oh!

206
00:07:41.693 --> 00:07:42.591
Where is she?

207
00:07:42.726 --> 00:07:44.091
Tell me the truth!

208
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.691
Tell me the truth!

209
00:07:45.793 --> 00:07:46.858
Yikes, Courtney.

210
00:07:46.926 --> 00:07:49.824
You got to stop
going off the deep end.


211
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.024
Your mother's fine.

212
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.624
A private room
finally opened up


213
00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:55.490
in the Sheldrake Pavilion.

214
00:07:55.626 --> 00:07:58.258
We got her all
nicely settled in.


215
00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.490
Oh, how much longer

216
00:07:59.559 --> 00:08:02.624
does she have to be
in the hospital anyway?


217
00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:04.824
The infection's
clearing up nicely,


218
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.858
so I'd say only a few more days.

219
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.390
Uh! A few more days!

220
00:08:09.559 --> 00:08:11.457
But that's an eternity!

221
00:08:11.593 --> 00:08:14.325
(<i>sobbing</i> )

222
00:08:14.826 --> 00:08:17.824
Aw, Courtney, I know
it's been really tough


223
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.924
having your mom
in the hospital.


224
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.824
Sure... it'd be
hard on anyone.


225
00:08:22.926 --> 00:08:24.124
You have no idea!

226
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.591
time
with Winston,


227
00:08:27.726 --> 00:08:30.058
and Daddy's away on business.

228
00:08:30.227 --> 00:08:32.791
I've been home alone.

229
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.390
Mom, since Mrs. Gripling
will only be


230
00:08:36.492 --> 00:08:38.024
in the hospital
a few more days,


231
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.891
you think maybe Courtney
could stay with us?


232
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.258
Fine by me, kiddo--
it's your call.


233
00:08:43.359 --> 00:08:44.158
I got to run.

234
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.524
They're posting the results

235
00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:46.891
of this month's birth pool

236
00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:48.191
and I'm in for a fiver.

237
00:08:48.293 --> 00:08:49.424
See you later.

238
00:08:49.526 --> 00:08:50.390
Ginger,

239
00:08:50.459 --> 00:08:53.225
you'd really
do that for me?


240
00:08:53.359 --> 00:08:56.225
Sure, but I have to warn you,

241
00:08:56.359 --> 00:08:59.191
things'll be pretty basic.

242
00:08:59.326 --> 00:09:00.258
Perfect!

243
00:09:00.326 --> 00:09:01.724
Simplicity is very
"in" right now.


244
00:09:01.826 --> 00:09:03.891
And I promise
to do my fair share.


245
00:09:04.026 --> 00:09:05.691
I don't want to be a burden

246
00:09:05.826 --> 00:09:06.791
to you and Mumma...

247
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.624
I... I mean,<i>your</i>
Mumma... mother.


248
00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:11.024
Well, you know
what I mean.


249
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.490
Well, I'd better
go get Maid
started on packing.


250
00:09:22.093 --> 00:09:24.091
with your generous
spirit, Ginger...


251
00:09:24.227 --> 00:09:26.791
letting Courtney stay
with you and all...


252
00:09:26.926 --> 00:09:28.258
especially after Camp Caprice,

253
00:09:28.326 --> 00:09:31.457
where she was clingy,
needy... a total deadweight.


254
00:09:31.593 --> 00:09:34.457
And those were her
positive qualities.


255
00:09:34.593 --> 00:09:36.091
Guys, you should've seen her

256
00:09:36.193 --> 00:09:38.591
when she got the news
her mom had to stay


257
00:09:38.726 --> 00:09:40.757
in the hospital
a few more days.


258
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.691
She was a wreck.

259
00:09:43.227 --> 00:09:45.258
Besides, she promised
she'd be helpful.


260
00:09:45.392 --> 00:09:49.958
Well, there's "helpful," and
then there's "Courtney helpful."


261
00:09:50.093 --> 00:09:50.958
MACIE:
Right...


262
00:09:51.026 --> 00:09:52.390
like reorganizing your closet

263
00:09:52.526 --> 00:09:53.390
without asking.

264
00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:54.924
That'd be "Courtney helpful."

265
00:09:55.093 --> 00:09:57.290
She wouldn't do that.

266
00:09:57.426 --> 00:09:58.324
Not alone.

267
00:09:58.459 --> 00:10:00.258
She'd have Miranda helping her.

268
00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:01.691
And don't forget
Mipsy and Lanie.


269
00:10:01.793 --> 00:10:04.657
Hope she doesn't
give away any of
your favorites.


270
00:10:04.759 --> 00:10:06.591
Oh, like the pants I gave you

271
00:10:06.726 --> 00:10:07.557
last Christmas!

272
00:10:07.626 --> 00:10:09.390
That's not going to happen!

273
00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:10.991
Hey, where're
you going?


274
00:10:11.126 --> 00:10:15.091
Just... you know,
to... to make sure.


275
00:10:15.459 --> 00:10:17.891
I want the surgery done
as soon as possible,


276
00:10:18.026 --> 00:10:20.891
and since you're the only
surgeon I know...


277
00:10:20.993 --> 00:10:22.624
Well, Carl,
I should tell you


278
00:10:22.726 --> 00:10:25.158
that you will need
a parent's signature


279
00:10:25.326 --> 00:10:27.457
to have this kind
of surgery done.


280
00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:29.791
A loophole! All right!

281
00:10:29.926 --> 00:10:31.225
Tough luck, Carl.

282
00:10:31.326 --> 00:10:32.124
What?

283
00:10:32.193 --> 00:10:33.257
Drag the Momster into this?

284
00:10:33.426 --> 00:10:37.158
Look, Dr. Dave, this
is totally a guy thing.


285
00:10:37.292 --> 00:10:39.791
The chin makes the man,
remember?


286
00:10:39.926 --> 00:10:42.858
Uh, Carl, I'm sorry,
but the law is the law.


287
00:10:42.993 --> 00:10:44.791
Okay, well... I hear
they got clinics


288
00:10:44.926 --> 00:10:46.024
that'll do this sort of thing

289
00:10:46.093 --> 00:10:47.824
without asking
a whole lot of questions.


290
00:10:47.993 --> 00:10:51.757
Hmm, I... uh, don't like
the sound of that at all.


291
00:10:51.926 --> 00:10:53.524
Hmm... didn't think you would.

292
00:10:53.659 --> 00:10:54.691
Eh... all right.

293
00:10:54.826 --> 00:10:56.024
I'll do the surgery.

294
00:10:56.093 --> 00:10:59.457
But, uh, you've got to do
something for me first.


295
00:10:59.593 --> 00:11:01.058
Uh, way ahead
of you, Dr. Dave.


296
00:11:01.126 --> 00:11:04.457
This spreadsheet
outlines my 40-year
installment plan.


297
00:11:04.593 --> 00:11:06.124
Course, you're going
to be real old


298
00:11:06.226 --> 00:11:08.958
when you get the last
payment and all, but...


299
00:11:09.093 --> 00:11:10.557
No, no, not that at all.

300
00:11:10.626 --> 00:11:13.624
You see, I think it's important
for the patient to try out


301
00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:16.091
what their new "look"
will be like, you see?


302
00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:18.624
Just so that they're
absolutely certain


303
00:11:18.759 --> 00:11:20.490
that this is what they want.

304
00:11:20.626 --> 00:11:21.591
Come again?

305
00:11:21.659 --> 00:11:23.257
Well, let me put it
this way, Carl:


306
00:11:23.426 --> 00:11:24.591
you wouldn't buy a car

307
00:11:24.659 --> 00:11:28.158
without taking it
for a spin first,
would you?


308
00:11:30.026 --> 00:11:31.224
They're not culottes, okay?

309
00:11:31.292 --> 00:11:34.524
They're cargo shorts,
so everybody can just...!


310
00:11:34.693 --> 00:11:35.524
(<i>kids laughing</i> )

311
00:11:35.593 --> 00:11:38.058
COURTNEY:
Mrs. Foutley!


312
00:11:38.192 --> 00:11:41.424
Hey, Ging, you're
just in time.


313
00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:44.257
(<i>proudly</i> ):
I'm going to cook
the spaghettini.


314
00:11:44.392 --> 00:11:48.091
But I usually do it--
well, I mean, not lately, but...


315
00:11:48.259 --> 00:11:49.290
Oh, I insist.

316
00:11:49.426 --> 00:11:50.991
After all,
I'm the guest,


317
00:11:51.126 --> 00:11:52.591
and I want to do
my fair share.


318
00:11:52.726 --> 00:11:55.924
And you've been
very helpful,
Courtney.


319
00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.457
She alphabetized
the spice rack.


320
00:11:57.626 --> 00:12:00.457
I tell you, there'll be
no more hunting around


321
00:12:00.593 --> 00:12:01.858
for that cream of tartar.

322
00:12:01.926 --> 00:12:05.657
You got anything that looks
like a chin, Lola?


323
00:12:05.793 --> 00:12:06.657
What for?

324
00:12:06.793 --> 00:12:08.791
Uh... school project.

325
00:12:08.926 --> 00:12:11.390
Like I believe<i>that</i>
for one minute.


326
00:12:11.526 --> 00:12:12.524
Try the tool drawer.

327
00:12:12.659 --> 00:12:13.624
I think you'll find

328
00:12:13.693 --> 00:12:15.624
some of my old
heel guards in there.

Perfect... thanks.

331
00:12:20.292 --> 00:12:23.490
Don't go far--
we're eating in five.


332
00:12:23.659 --> 00:12:24.757
Actually,
Mrs. Foutley,


333
00:12:24.826 --> 00:12:27.424
it takes eight minutes
for the pasta to cook.


334
00:12:27.593 --> 00:12:30.091
So we'll have it
a little extra...


335
00:12:30.226 --> 00:12:31.190
"al dente."

336
00:12:31.326 --> 00:12:32.091
Who's he?

337
00:12:32.159 --> 00:12:34.091
(<i>both giggle</i> )

00:12:34.226 --> 00:12:35.824

(<i>giggling</i> )

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.024
I know,
your mother told me,


341
00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:40.424
and it's so funny.

342
00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:41.657
(<i>sighs</i> )

343
00:12:41.726 --> 00:12:44.390
You know, I'm
doing so well
with dinner,


344
00:12:44.526 --> 00:12:46.457
I want to make
breakfast, too.


345
00:12:46.593 --> 00:12:48.557
No, I'll make
breakfast.


346
00:12:48.693 --> 00:12:50.424
Don't be ridiculous, Ginger.

347
00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:51.324
I'll do it.

348
00:12:51.492 --> 00:12:53.257
No,<i>I</i> will.

349
00:12:53.426 --> 00:12:54.257
No, no,<i>I</i> will.

350
00:12:54.326 --> 00:12:55.924
You know,
the dinner dishes


351
00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.357
are still up for grabs.

352
00:12:57.459 --> 00:12:58.457
Then I'll do them.

353
00:12:58.626 --> 00:12:59.624
No, I'll do them.

354
00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:01.157
No, I'll do them.

355
00:13:01.292 --> 00:13:02.058
I'll do it.

356
00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:03.090
I'll do them.

Oh, ahh!

361
00:13:14.192 --> 00:13:16.357
(<i>perkily</i> ):
Morning,
sleepyhead.


362
00:13:16.492 --> 00:13:18.024
What time did you get up?

363
00:13:18.125 --> 00:13:20.224
5:30-- can you believe it?

364
00:13:20.359 --> 00:13:21.490
Up with the pheasants.

365
00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:23.190
You mean, the chickens.

366
00:13:23.292 --> 00:13:24.390
Those, too!

367
00:13:24.459 --> 00:13:26.624
I guess you made
breakfast for my mom.


368
00:13:26.726 --> 00:13:27.757
And it was so easy.

369
00:13:27.926 --> 00:13:28.858
All I had
to do was put


370
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.824
the frozen waffle
in the toaster,


371
00:13:30.926 --> 00:13:32.090
then depress
the button.


372
00:13:32.226 --> 00:13:33.390
Your mother
was thrilled!


373
00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:35.924
Are you always cheerful
in the morning?


374
00:13:36.059 --> 00:13:37.224
Yes.

375
00:13:37.326 --> 00:13:38.224
Oh, waffle?

376
00:13:38.292 --> 00:13:39.524
(<i>groans</i> ):
No, thanks.


377
00:13:39.693 --> 00:13:41.324
I'll get something
at school.


378

LOIS:
Over my dead body,

00:13:42.826 --> 00:13:44.424
he's getting a chin implant!

380
00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:45.958
Do you hear? Dead!

381
00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:46.858
In the ground,

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:49.024
six feet under,
cold!


383
00:13:49.125 --> 00:13:50.858
Yeah, well,
I... uh...


384
00:13:50.993 --> 00:13:51.824
Dave, don't tell me

385
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.557
you didn't tell
him that?!


386
00:13:53.693 --> 00:13:55.791
Look, let me clue
you in on Carl.


387
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.457
You've got to nip
stuff like this
in the bud.


388
00:13:58.593 --> 00:14:00.457
Trust me...
you give him an inch,


389
00:14:00.626 --> 00:14:03.324
the next thing you know,
you're out one mile.


390
00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:06.757
So, uh... what
did you tell him?


391
00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:07.757
Oh, uh, I thought

392
00:14:07.826 --> 00:14:09.057
the better way
to go was to...


393
00:14:09.125 --> 00:14:11.457
(<i>chuckles</i> ):
well, to have
him walk around


394
00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:13.224
with a fake chin
on for a while.


395
00:14:13.392 --> 00:14:14.457
(<i>laughs</i>
<i>nervously</i> )


396
00:14:14.626 --> 00:14:17.390
That explains the heel guard.

397
00:14:17.526 --> 00:14:19.357
I think he'll learn
pretty quickly


398
00:14:19.492 --> 00:14:20.991
that the chin
doesn't make the man


399
00:14:21.125 --> 00:14:22.858
and lose all interest
in the surgery.


400
00:14:23.025 --> 00:14:25.691
Of course, I...
I hope I didn't
step out of line


401
00:14:25.826 --> 00:14:27.991
by not consulting
you first, Lois.


402
00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:28.990
No, not at all,

403
00:14:29.125 --> 00:14:31.190
and it's
a smart move, Dave.


404
00:14:31.359 --> 00:14:33.424
Course, it remains
to be seen


405
00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:34.657
if it's smart enough.

406
00:14:34.726 --> 00:14:37.023
You should really think
about settling down


407
00:14:37.125 --> 00:14:38.990
and having some kids
of your own.


408
00:14:39.092 --> 00:14:40.090
You'd be good
at it.


409
00:14:40.159 --> 00:14:42.057
You know, lately
I have been thinking


410
00:14:42.226 --> 00:14:43.090
of doing just that.

411
00:14:43.159 --> 00:14:45.224
Actually, I was
wondering if...

Yes, uh,
that'd be fine, too.

I can hear
them outside.


420
00:15:01.559 --> 00:15:04.157
Hold on, I've got
to cover it with makeup


421
00:15:04.326 --> 00:15:05.190
so it looks natural.

Good thing
you and my mom

Make sure to blend.

it's important.

Oh, well,

you'll be
heading home.

Well, not exactly--
as it turns out,


454
00:16:09.526 --> 00:16:11.357
she needs to get away
to recuperate,


455
00:16:11.526 --> 00:16:14.257
so she'll be jetting off
to a spa in New Mexico


456
00:16:14.392 --> 00:16:16.490
and I, of course,
can't go with her


457
00:16:16.626 --> 00:16:18.624
because I'd miss
too much school.


458

So you're saying...?

459
00:16:20.526 --> 00:16:22.890
I just asked your mother,
and she said


460
00:16:23.025 --> 00:16:24.557
I can stay until
Mumma gets back--


461
00:16:24.659 --> 00:16:28.224
if it's okay
with you, that is--
and I'm sure it is?

if it isn't?

is it "yes" or "no"?

But Ginger...

I said "No!"

00:17:12.326 --> 00:17:13.557
Next!

481
00:17:13.925 --> 00:17:16.057
Hi, Blake,
nice espadrilles.


482
00:17:16.159 --> 00:17:17.357
Why, thank you,
old man.


483
00:17:17.426 --> 00:17:20.524
Just doing my part
for "Casual Fridays."


484
00:17:20.659 --> 00:17:24.390
Now, what's
all this folderol about...?


485
00:17:24.526 --> 00:17:25.490
F
-Foutley?

486
00:17:25.626 --> 00:17:26.424
Gripling?

487
00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:29.424
What's that
on your chin?


488
00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:30.457
A chin.

489
00:17:30.626 --> 00:17:31.324
Duh.

490
00:17:31.392 --> 00:17:32.424
I'm thinking of having

491
00:17:32.492 --> 00:17:34.857
one of these babies
installed permanently,


492
00:17:35.025 --> 00:17:36.090
and I just
wanted to see


493
00:17:36.226 --> 00:17:38.424
how it might sit
with some people.


494
00:17:38.526 --> 00:17:40.190
Well, i-it's having

495
00:17:40.292 --> 00:17:43.657
n-no effect on me
whatsoever.


496
00:17:43.793 --> 00:17:44.591
Boy, it's sure not

497
00:17:44.726 --> 00:17:46.390
looking that way,
Blakey.


498
00:17:46.526 --> 00:17:47.657
Initial denial,

499
00:17:47.792 --> 00:17:51.290
undermined by
extreme spazzing.


500
00:17:51.426 --> 00:17:52.957
It's... it's...

501
00:17:53.059 --> 00:17:55.657
(<i>screaming</i> ):
It's not natural, I say!


502
00:17:55.759 --> 00:17:56.691
(<i>screams</i> )

503
00:17:56.792 --> 00:17:57.724
(<i>sighs</i> )

504
00:17:57.859 --> 00:17:59.457
Well, that's it.

505
00:17:59.626 --> 00:18:00.923
With one
of these puppies,


506
00:18:01.059 --> 00:18:02.624
I'm going to rule
for sure


507
00:18:02.759 --> 00:18:04.390
and rule for good.

508
00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:06.757
(<i>cackles</i> )

509
00:18:08.426 --> 00:18:09.823
(<i>student screams</i> )

510
00:18:09.992 --> 00:18:11.957
But I don't understand.

511
00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:15.224
Courtney was going
to stay on with us.


512
00:18:15.392 --> 00:18:16.424
What happened?

513
00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:18.157
Well, she
just couldn't.


514
00:18:18.326 --> 00:18:19.657
Gee, I was even
going to pick up


515
00:18:19.825 --> 00:18:23.490
her favorite TV dinner,
turkey breast stir-fry.


516
00:18:23.593 --> 00:18:25.691
So... she didn't
even say why?


517
00:18:25.825 --> 00:18:28.457
(<i>snapping</i> ):
No, she didn't
say why.


518
00:18:28.593 --> 00:18:29.457
Is that okay?

519
00:18:29.593 --> 00:18:30.823
I mean, if she doesn't stay?

520
00:18:30.925 --> 00:18:34.090
Think you'll be all right
with just<i>me</i> again?


521
00:18:34.192 --> 00:18:35.557
(<i>groans</i> )

522
00:18:35.626 --> 00:18:40.624
Boy, when those hormones
kick in, they really kick in.


523
00:18:42.758 --> 00:18:43.823
Boy, oh boy,
I can't wait


524
00:18:43.959 --> 00:18:45.724
to have
a permanent
one put in.


525
00:18:45.859 --> 00:18:46.923
Hey, think
Dr. Dave'll


526
00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:48.123
be able to do
it today?


527
00:18:48.259 --> 00:18:49.524
'Cause I'd like
to take over


528
00:18:49.659 --> 00:18:51.857
the world
by Tuesday,
if possible.


529
00:18:51.992 --> 00:18:52.890
Wow, Carl,

530
00:18:52.959 --> 00:18:54.957
you're scaring
everyone off.


531
00:18:55.059 --> 00:18:55.923
Yep.

532
00:18:55.992 --> 00:18:58.756
This chin is
mighty powerful.


533
00:19:00.725 --> 00:19:01.691
You don't think

534
00:19:01.758 --> 00:19:02.723
it's<i>too</i> powerful,
do you?


535
00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:04.524
I mean, everyone
was screaming


536
00:19:04.659 --> 00:19:06.756
and running off
at school, too.


537
00:19:06.892 --> 00:19:07.990
But...

538
00:19:08.092 --> 00:19:09.324
it's
what you wanted.


539
00:19:09.459 --> 00:19:10.923
Oh, but
not exactly.


540
00:19:11.059 --> 00:19:14.157
The chin is supposed
to be "me" bait.


541
00:19:14.259 --> 00:19:15.390
They scream
and run off,


542
00:19:15.459 --> 00:19:17.923
and I can kiss
the Carl dynasty
good-bye.


543
00:19:18.059 --> 00:19:19.157
Well... okay,

544
00:19:19.226 --> 00:19:21.224
so maybe your chin
can front for you.


545
00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:23.190
You know, like,
it does the talking,


546
00:19:23.326 --> 00:19:24.823
but they're
listening to you?


547
00:19:24.959 --> 00:19:27.157
But... what if it
doesn't end there?


548
00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:28.524
What if it takes over?

549
00:19:28.659 --> 00:19:29.756
I may rule the world,

550
00:19:29.892 --> 00:19:31.424
but my chin'll rule me.

551
00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:32.457
Creepy!

552
00:19:32.526 --> 00:19:34.190
Oh, and every time
you look down


553
00:19:34.359 --> 00:19:36.157
to see if your
shoes are tied?


554
00:19:36.326 --> 00:19:37.290
There it'll be...

555
00:19:37.392 --> 00:19:38.357
(<i>gasps</i> )

556
00:19:38.426 --> 00:19:40.524

Staring back
up at you.

00:19:40.626 --> 00:19:42.224
(<i>gasping</i> )

558
00:19:42.326 --> 00:19:44.457
Get it off me,
Hoods.


559
00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:45.990
Get it off me!

(<i>groans with effort</i> )

562
00:19:48.859 --> 00:19:49.690
It's stuck, Carl!

563
00:19:49.825 --> 00:19:52.123
We've got to find
Dr. Dave!


564
00:19:52.259 --> 00:19:53.090
I've got to get me

565
00:19:53.226 --> 00:19:55.457
a "chin"-ectomy--
pronto!

(<i>groans</i> )

569
00:20:05.459 --> 00:20:06.390
Ginger, will you be

570
00:20:06.459 --> 00:20:07.756
in this bad mood
for much longer?


571
00:20:07.825 --> 00:20:11.324
Because I feel like I'm doing
homework with my mother.


572
00:20:11.492 --> 00:20:13.490
Mother-- why do
you say "mother"?


573
00:20:13.593 --> 00:20:15.290
No reason,
just that she hates it


574
00:20:15.459 --> 00:20:17.257
when I turn the pages
too loudly.


575
00:20:17.426 --> 00:20:19.656
You know,
it suddenly hit me.


576
00:20:19.792 --> 00:20:22.690
Homework may be
called "homework"


577
00:20:22.859 --> 00:20:23.790
for a reason.

578
00:20:23.892 --> 00:20:25.090
Yeah, I agree.

579
00:20:25.226 --> 00:20:26.357
Bye,
Ginger.


580
00:20:26.492 --> 00:20:27.290
Guys...

581
00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:29.290
(<i>doorbell rings</i> )

582
00:20:32.359 --> 00:20:34.957
Um... hope I'm not
bothering you, Ginger,


583
00:20:35.092 --> 00:20:37.090
but I do need
to pick up my things.


584
00:20:37.192 --> 00:20:38.290
You're not
bothering me.


585
00:20:38.392 --> 00:20:40.790
You want a soda
or something?


586
00:20:41.725 --> 00:20:42.923
Mmm,
no, thank you.


587
00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:44.656
I don't want
to be a burden
in any way.


588
00:20:44.792 --> 00:20:46.524
You're not being
a burden, okay?


589
00:20:46.658 --> 00:20:49.257
I mean, it was
nice having you
here, but...


590
00:20:49.426 --> 00:20:51.057
I don't need
an explanation.


591
00:20:51.192 --> 00:20:52.224
Anyway, it turns out

592
00:20:52.292 --> 00:20:54.424
Mumma's canceled
her trip to New Mexico.


593
00:20:54.593 --> 00:20:56.023
Oh, hey, that's great.

00:20:56.092 --> 00:20:59.690
COURTNEY:
I admit, I had to work
the pity thing a bit,


595
00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:00.823
but she gave in.

596
00:21:00.892 --> 00:21:02.424
Sometimes she gets
caught up in herself


597
00:21:02.526 --> 00:21:04.990
and needs to be reminded
she has children.


598
00:21:05.125 --> 00:21:07.690
Yeah, I guess that can happen.

599
00:21:07.859 --> 00:21:09.823
I mean, I don't
want her around


600
00:21:09.925 --> 00:21:11.023
all the time,
but I...


601
00:21:11.092 --> 00:21:13.090
Well, here I am,
running on and on,


602
00:21:13.226 --> 00:21:15.390
when I came by
to pick up my things.


603
00:21:15.526 --> 00:21:18.656
I mean, two people
shouldn't speak at all


604
00:21:18.758 --> 00:21:20.224
when they're fighting.

605
00:21:20.392 --> 00:21:22.324
Hey, uh, Courtney...

606
00:21:22.459 --> 00:21:24.690
you know... someday
I'm going to want


607
00:21:24.859 --> 00:21:26.790
to talk to you
about all this,


608
00:21:26.892 --> 00:21:27.823
just not right now.

609
00:21:27.892 --> 00:21:30.157
Even though
I don't understand,


610
00:21:30.292 --> 00:21:31.390
I'll say I do...

611
00:21:31.459 --> 00:21:33.756
just to keep the lines
of communication open.


612
00:21:33.925 --> 00:21:35.756
Thanks... you
didn't really have


613
00:21:35.925 --> 00:21:37.923
to beg your mom
to stay, did you?


614
00:21:38.059 --> 00:21:40.524
Well, I may have
exaggerated a little.


615
00:21:40.658 --> 00:21:42.590
(<i>chuckles</i> )

616
00:21:47.725 --> 00:21:51.823
So, uh... you took
the bus home,


617
00:21:51.959 --> 00:21:53.690
then you took
it back here


618
00:21:53.825 --> 00:21:56.656
so we could drive
home together?


619
00:21:56.825 --> 00:21:57.723
Yeah.

620
00:21:57.859 --> 00:21:59.756
That's okay,
isn't it?


621
00:21:59.859 --> 00:22:00.957
Sure.

622
00:22:01.092 --> 00:22:02.490
I'm going
to go get a soda,


623
00:22:02.592 --> 00:22:05.190
so don't leave
without me, okay?


624
00:22:05.292 --> 00:22:06.290
I won't.

625
00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:08.823
I'll be right here
when you get back.


626
00:22:10.359 --> 00:22:11.290
You want one?

627
00:22:11.426 --> 00:22:12.390
My treat.

628
00:22:12.558 --> 00:22:13.390
Okay.

629
00:22:13.525 --> 00:22:15.357
Uh, diet anything.

630
00:22:16.992 --> 00:22:18.023
Lola.

631
00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:18.790
Carl.

632
00:22:18.959 --> 00:22:19.656
Hoodsey.

633
00:22:19.792 --> 00:22:20.656
Hi, Mrs. Foutley.

634
00:22:20.725 --> 00:22:22.257
Stick around
for half an hour--


635
00:22:22.426 --> 00:22:23.424
I'll give you
a ride home.


636
00:22:23.558 --> 00:22:25.923
No, thanks, we're
trying to support


637
00:22:26.059 --> 00:22:28.123
public transportation.

638
00:22:32.092 --> 00:22:35.390
May the chin
never rise to haunt me.


639
00:22:35.525 --> 00:22:37.090
Better put
a rock on top,


640
00:22:37.226 --> 00:22:38.090
just in case.

641
00:22:38.159 --> 00:22:39.690
You know, I'm sure
I've learned


642
00:22:39.825 --> 00:22:41.923
a very valuable
lesson here, Hoods.


643
00:22:42.092 --> 00:22:44.523
Like, "Be careful
what you wish for,"


644
00:22:44.658 --> 00:22:47.090
or "Be happy with
what you got."


645
00:22:47.259 --> 00:22:47.957
Uh-huh.

646
00:22:48.059 --> 00:22:49.224
Think it'll stick?

647
00:22:49.326 --> 00:22:51.390
Not a chance.

DR. DAVE:
Right... yes, uh,
that'd be fine, too.
