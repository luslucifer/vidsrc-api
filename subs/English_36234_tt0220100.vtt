1
00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:22.454
I don't remember
the details... except that...


2
00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:47.371
Thirty seconds.

3
00:01:53.846 --> 00:01:56.046
Except that...

4
00:01:57.582 --> 00:02:01.550
Alex was lying
on his back.


5
00:02:01.852 --> 00:02:04.052
Fifteen seconds.

6
00:02:07.724 --> 00:02:11.659
- Eight, seven...
- Six.


7
00:02:12.428 --> 00:02:16.663
...three, two, one.

8
00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:23.402
But I couldn't hear
what he was saying.


9
00:02:23.404 --> 00:02:28.240
And there was just this tiny,
tiny wound.


10
00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:35.913
Almost like a cut where the
scab has been pulled off...


11
00:02:36.415 --> 00:02:38.948
and it's seeping blood.

12
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:44.452
But there was an awful
lot of blood coming from...


13
00:02:44.454 --> 00:02:47.521
this tiny... little... cut.

14
00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:53.760
And the tissues I was...

15
00:02:53.762 --> 00:02:57.997
laying down weren't
soaking it up.


16
00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:05.436
And so what did you do when they didn't...
didn't soak it up?


17
00:03:09.208 --> 00:03:11.708
Kept pressing on it.

18
00:03:13.044 --> 00:03:17.579
With... with the same tissues or...
Yeah. And with my...


19
00:03:19.215 --> 00:03:22.416
Just with my fingers.

20
00:03:26.488 --> 00:03:29.322
And then what?

21
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.727
I don't know.

22
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.763
What was Alex doing?

23
00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:44.000
He was... trying to...

24
00:03:46.637 --> 00:03:51.139
Trying to tell me things.

25
00:03:53.743 --> 00:03:55.843
What kind of things?

26
00:03:55.845 --> 00:04:00.113
Some in Swedish.
Um...


27
00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:04.817
Swedish things that
you've heard before? Or...


28
00:04:08.022 --> 00:04:10.288
It was very hard to
understand what he was saying.


29
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:17.728
And I woke up... I think, not
really knowing what had gone on.


30
00:04:18.597 --> 00:04:19.262
Did he know that

31
00:04:19.264 --> 00:04:24.333
he was in... in some sort of pain in
the dream or he was just unaware?


32
00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:28.169
He seemed
to be...


33
00:04:31.908 --> 00:04:35.809
almost... almost happy.

34
00:04:38.113 --> 00:04:40.179
Happy?

35
00:04:43.184 --> 00:04:45.984
So... so he was happy and he
was bleeding from this... from


36
00:04:45.986 --> 00:04:49.887
this very little cut and
you had a tissue.


37
00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:50.554
Yeah.

38
00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:52.522
...that couldn't soak
up the blood.


39
00:04:52.524 --> 00:04:56.025
Yes. And that was all
you had and you kept


40
00:04:56.027 --> 00:04:59.661
dabbing it with the
tissue and he was...


41
00:04:59.663 --> 00:05:02.397
he was talking to you
in Swedish...


42
00:05:03.967 --> 00:05:04.999
Happily.

43
00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:06.166
- Yes.
- And he was using


44
00:05:06.168 --> 00:05:12.405
endearments or... I don't know.
I think so.


45
00:05:12.407 --> 00:05:15.708
And... and... and
what did you do after?


46
00:05:18.245 --> 00:05:20.778
I'm not sure.

47
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.814
Let me ask you
something.


48
00:05:26.784 --> 00:05:29.084
Um, I'm just going to
give you a few words.


49
00:05:29.086 --> 00:05:34.889
And I just want you to tell me the
first thing that comes into your head.


50
00:05:36.859 --> 00:05:38.692
Uh... okay?

51
00:05:40.028 --> 00:05:41.560
Okay, sleep.

52
00:05:42.796 --> 00:05:46.564
First thing, don't take time
to think, just first thing.


53
00:05:46.566 --> 00:05:48.766
- Sleep.
- EXEC.


54
00:05:48.901 --> 00:05:50.400
Blood.

55
00:05:50.802 --> 00:05:52.401
Fresh.

56
00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.201
Tissue.

57
00:05:55.938 --> 00:05:57.637
Fluffy.

58
00:05:59.107 --> 00:06:00.840
Happy.

59
00:06:01.375 --> 00:06:03.041
Sad.

60
00:06:04.511 --> 00:06:12.216
When you woke up... This was last night
when you were at your friend's house?


61
00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:15.785
- Yeah.
- What did you do?


62
00:06:20.825 --> 00:06:25.761
I took a Melatonin,
a tablet to help me sleep.


63
00:06:26.396 --> 00:06:31.565
Then I... woke up
and came here.


64
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:38.938
So you take something to
fall asleep a lot? No, no.


65
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.907
But you happen to have
them with you?


66
00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:44.342
I carry them with me.

67
00:06:44.344 --> 00:06:47.678
What happened?
Oh.


68
00:06:47.913 --> 00:06:51.080
- Hi. How are you?
- Hello.


69
00:06:51.482 --> 00:06:55.684
What time's your meeting?
In 20 minutes.


70
00:06:55.686 --> 00:06:57.218
- What?
- In 20 minutes.


71
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:03.557
Well, we don't have time to call AAA.
Do you want a ride?


72
00:07:06.595 --> 00:07:10.797
There's no need for
dramatics. I'll take you.


73
00:07:11.032 --> 00:07:15.534
Thank you, Lauren.
You are so generous.


74
00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:23.240
- What's that attitude?
- No attitude.


75
00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:28.745
So two nights ago I decided to...
I had to leave the house...


76
00:07:28.747 --> 00:07:31.180
- Red Mullet?
- Because...


77
00:07:31.182 --> 00:07:32.781
Sir, what's in the bag?

78
00:07:32.783 --> 00:07:39.154
- Alex was...
- Massage chair.


79
00:07:39.156 --> 00:07:41.322
- Upset.
- Red Mullet.


80
00:07:41.324 --> 00:07:45.693
So, we'll call you later.
Okay? Okay.


81
00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:48.195
I'll put you through. Okay.

82
00:07:48.197 --> 00:07:50.864
I'm Quintus from Roman Springs.
People call me Q.


83
00:07:50.866 --> 00:07:52.332
Uh-huh. I've come
to do the massage.


84
00:07:52.334 --> 00:07:55.401
Oh, wonderful. What kind
of massage do you do?


85
00:07:55.403 --> 00:07:58.904
Gently caressing the soft
tissue, Swedish technique.


86
00:07:58.906 --> 00:08:03.141
Deeper penetration, I use a
shiatsu technique. Mm-hm.


87
00:08:03.143 --> 00:08:09.313
Massage auras, hover chakras,
what makes you cum. Excuse me?


88
00:08:09.315 --> 00:08:13.383
House and go stay with my friend.
Red Mullet.


89
00:08:13.385 --> 00:08:15.418
So I just... took a
couple of things with me.


90
00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.721
Um, well, do you set up or...
I didn't think I'd...


91
00:08:18.723 --> 00:08:20.122
I have a chair which
I could put there,


92
00:08:20.124 --> 00:08:23.558
but generally I visit people
in their work stations...


93
00:08:23.626 --> 00:08:25.192
I'm just curious
about the pills.


94
00:08:25.194 --> 00:08:26.660
- Red Mullet.
- Because of the...


95
00:08:26.662 --> 00:08:30.363
Oh, he's... Let me put you to voicemail.
Okay. Well, all the


96
00:08:30.365 --> 00:08:32.031
executives are in one big
meeting right now.


97
00:08:32.033 --> 00:08:35.901
Well, that's excellent. I can attack
the mother lode in one place.


98
00:08:35.903 --> 00:08:37.202
Like going to a Web.

99
00:08:37.204 --> 00:08:38.770
Massage their
egos, that's for sure.


100
00:08:38.772 --> 00:08:42.039
Oh, that's par for the course
and then I can spread out...


101
00:08:42.041 --> 00:08:45.609
Right, but if you can just be
really subtle. I am subtle...


102
00:08:45.611 --> 00:08:50.013
And discreet.
You won't even hear me.


103
00:08:50.348 --> 00:08:54.817
Hi. This is Q from Roman Springs.
He's a massage therapist.


104
00:08:54.819 --> 00:08:59.855
Hail! <i>Egos sum Quintus</i>, your
friendly gladiator. People call me Q.


105
00:08:59.857 --> 00:09:05.594
I'm from Roman Springs and I say to
your tension, "<i>Veni vidi vici.</i>"


106
00:09:05.596 --> 00:09:10.532
This is the friend of the friend
from Roman Springs so they usually


107
00:09:10.534 --> 00:09:12.634
send over little sort of
little, uh, gift just to


108
00:09:12.636 --> 00:09:15.603
entice us to go to Roman
Springs for the retreat.


109
00:09:15.605 --> 00:09:20.174
I was expecting just a fruit
basket, but I guess this is a...


110
00:09:20.176 --> 00:09:23.010
And even if he
comes to bed at five in


111
00:09:23.012 --> 00:09:27.647
the morning, I still know that
he's coming to bed at some time.


112
00:09:27.782 --> 00:09:30.249
- In the lower back...
- If we can do this,


113
00:09:30.251 --> 00:09:32.251
- we've got a meeting running.
- He has a bad back.


114
00:09:32.253 --> 00:09:34.920
Keep up with... Yeah.
I would urge them to


115
00:09:34.922 --> 00:09:39.624
- avail themselves with some...
- He's got a bad back


116
00:09:39.626 --> 00:09:42.994
physical education
at Roman Springs.


117
00:09:42.996 --> 00:09:47.832
Guys, we've got a situation
on the set of <i>Teen Scene.</i>


118
00:09:47.834 --> 00:09:50.401
There's a...
Ow, go easy on me...


119
00:09:50.403 --> 00:09:54.638
Outbreak of herpes and
it's really a nightmare.


120
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.740
I mean, the insurance
company's given us two


121
00:09:56.742 --> 00:09:59.542
more days and then we gotta
make a decision.


122
00:09:59.544 --> 00:10:02.878
Nobody's found out
who the source is?


123
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.314
Uh, well, I think they're
trying to avoid naming names.


124
00:10:06.316 --> 00:10:08.883
- Is there a medic?
- Yeah. Four down.


125
00:10:08.885 --> 00:10:11.018
They've done everything
they can with Blistex...


126
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.586
Been together... and
cover-up, but it's just


127
00:10:12.588 --> 00:10:15.121
a situation to be forewarned of. We
might have to hold up production.


128
00:10:15.123 --> 00:10:18.157
You should put the
leads in separate hotels.


129
00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:20.659
Long enough to...

130
00:10:20.661 --> 00:10:22.861
- Did you go by the set?
- Feel like a long time.


131
00:10:22.863 --> 00:10:26.464
Yeah. I went yesterday, which is
why I couldn't go to Lancaster.


132
00:10:26.466 --> 00:10:30.901
I had to fire the A.D. I'm sorry. I
didn't wanna get sister-girl on him,


133
00:10:30.903 --> 00:10:36.339
but I had to. You know, he challenged
me, so... But morale is up. So...


134
00:10:36.341 --> 00:10:39.208
- Yeah. You go girl.
- Yeah. You know?


135
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.310
Looks like you
got 'em.


136
00:10:41.312 --> 00:10:44.379
There I am. That's it, that's it.
That's all. Walk in.


137
00:10:44.381 --> 00:10:48.015
Boost morale, by firing somebody.
That's... Hey.


138
00:10:48.017 --> 00:10:53.020
A little update on John Tammer.
Oh. John Tammer.


139
00:10:53.022 --> 00:10:56.623
Yeah, we had to fire... I had to fire
five of the producers last night


140
00:10:56.625 --> 00:10:58.024
because somebody was caught
embezzling money so...


141
00:10:58.026 --> 00:11:02.695
Holy cow. They go down like
flies in this organization.


142
00:11:02.697 --> 00:11:04.997
- He seems to be...
- Well, what? He was...


143
00:11:04.999 --> 00:11:07.866
Really caught with
his hand in the till? Or...


144
00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:10.501
- Is it your friend?
- Falling apart.


145
00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:14.372
All right. Well, we
we won't talk about it.


146
00:11:14.374 --> 00:11:17.041
Got this reckless... What can
you tell us about <i>Madeline</i>?


147
00:11:17.043 --> 00:11:22.679
The desk cards came back and most of
the comments was that it wasn't scary.


148
00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:27.150
Reckless. It's plain scary,
so that's pretty good.


149
00:11:27.152 --> 00:11:30.586
We're living almost as if he's
happier when he's falling apart.


150
00:11:30.588 --> 00:11:35.724
The problem
is that I heard the rough cut


151
00:11:35.726 --> 00:11:38.660
and apparently the sound
effects are such


152
00:11:38.662 --> 00:11:41.562
that the Buddhists, when
they set themselves on fire,


153
00:11:41.564 --> 00:11:46.266
aren't crackling. They are sort
of popping and exploding and...


154
00:11:46.268 --> 00:11:48.201
It's adding a comic
undercurrent to an otherwise.


155
00:11:48.203 --> 00:11:51.437
- Hey how are you?
- Fairly serious visual.


156
00:11:51.439 --> 00:11:54.373
Now, uh, it's gonna
push us somewhat


157
00:11:54.375 --> 00:11:56.575
- farther into the red.
- I wish I didn't


158
00:11:56.577 --> 00:11:59.444
care so much. You know,
we have to address it.


159
00:11:59.446 --> 00:12:01.446
- No way around it.
- That's your call.


160
00:12:01.448 --> 00:12:04.482
- That's my observation.
- Uh, it's a good call.


161
00:12:04.484 --> 00:12:09.353
Same thing for <i>Flicker of Light.</i> We got soft
focus a few days in a row and there's...


162
00:12:09.355 --> 00:12:10.620
That might not be
a bad thing.


163
00:12:10.622 --> 00:12:14.190
Because she's not a
spring chicken anymore.


164
00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:17.092
Looks like <i>Playboy</i>.

165
00:12:23.265 --> 00:12:25.798
Jesus Christ,
what's that?


166
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.533
Five point six.

167
00:12:27.535 --> 00:12:29.835
Good old Hollywood,
that's all.


168
00:12:29.837 --> 00:12:32.070
Is that a term I used?
So don't worry.


169
00:12:32.072 --> 00:12:34.439
Everything's fine. No, if
you want to, but it's fine.


170
00:12:34.441 --> 00:12:37.708
You all right?
Everybody okay?


171
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:42.412
- Honey, you okay?
- We came down.


172
00:12:42.414 --> 00:12:44.514
But I really...

173
00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:49.217
You're a fucking slut.

174
00:12:49.886 --> 00:12:54.355
And you are a fool if you don't
think I know what's going on.


175
00:12:55.057 --> 00:12:58.725
Ah! I've had it!
I have absolutely had it!


176
00:12:58.727 --> 00:13:02.361
You know, you can't go on
like this. It's not going on!


177
00:13:02.363 --> 00:13:04.529
- The gravy train is over!
- Lauren.


178
00:13:04.531 --> 00:13:06.731
When we get back, you can just
pack your bags and leave.


179
00:13:06.733 --> 00:13:10.968
'Cause I am not a fool!
I got enough to worry about.


180
00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:14.304
I gotta try and... Oh, God.

181
00:13:14.306 --> 00:13:15.138
You've gone
fucking mad.


182
00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.341
No. I have not gone mad.
Yes, you've gone mad.


183
00:13:18.343 --> 00:13:19.375
- No.
- You've gone mad.


184
00:13:19.377 --> 00:13:21.643
How have I gone mad? What
the fuck is your problem?


185
00:13:21.645 --> 00:13:24.412
What is my problem?
You are my problem. You!


186
00:13:24.414 --> 00:13:26.947
- You all right?
- I wanted to ask you...


187
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:29.616
What did I do now? Oh, what did you do now?
You've never done


188
00:13:29.618 --> 00:13:31.351
anything wrong. I don't know
what's been going on the past


189
00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:34.821
few months. You know, if you don't think
I don't notice the phone calls...


190
00:13:34.823 --> 00:13:38.991
Oh, God... been going on for the
past few months? I've had...


191
00:13:38.993 --> 00:13:40.826
I think you're
gonna make a great


192
00:13:40.828 --> 00:13:45.063
actress, let's just put it that way.
A great actress.


193
00:13:45.298 --> 00:13:47.564
- What is your problem?
- Smells strong.


194
00:13:47.566 --> 00:13:50.600
I told you,
my problem is you.


195
00:13:50.602 --> 00:13:55.871
Okay. What's the story
on the <i>Blind Venetians</i>?


196
00:13:55.873 --> 00:13:57.439
Uh, the <i>Blind</i>
<i>Venetians</i> are...


197
00:13:57.441 --> 00:14:02.510
essentially that they've been
scheduled to open on President's Day.


198
00:14:02.512 --> 00:14:05.846
My love, my time,
my money.


199
00:14:05.848 --> 00:14:10.050
My recommendation is
that they move it back to


200
00:14:10.052 --> 00:14:11.451
Helen Keller's birthday
just to...


201
00:14:11.453 --> 00:14:16.689
I'm sorry, Darren. We need to have a
serious talk about Alex being late.


202
00:14:16.691 --> 00:14:20.693
I mean... he lives three blocks
away. This is ridiculous.


203
00:14:20.695 --> 00:14:21.927
It's unprofessional.
It's unfair to us.


204
00:14:21.929 --> 00:14:24.696
Sweetie, we just got through
having a serious talk about it.


205
00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:27.131
- I made it clear...
- With us. Connie...


206
00:14:27.133 --> 00:14:28.699
He's my best friend.

207
00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:31.168
I'm tired of
waiting.


208
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.304
We can get a little
more done before he gets here.


209
00:14:34.306 --> 00:14:35.638
That's the point.
We're tryin' to...


210
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.374
- There he is.
- Here... here he comes.


211
00:14:38.843 --> 00:14:39.641
As if on cue.

212
00:14:39.643 --> 00:14:41.275
You won't have to pay
for anything for much longer.


213
00:14:41.277 --> 00:14:44.111
Well, I don't mind paying for anything.
Listen to me...


214
00:14:44.113 --> 00:14:46.179
I don't mind... I'm
getting my shit together.


215
00:14:46.181 --> 00:14:49.749
And I'm getting out of your
life, if that's what you want.


216
00:14:49.751 --> 00:14:51.617
The man will
rock and roll.


217
00:14:51.619 --> 00:14:53.919
We gotta roll with
the man's punches because...


218
00:14:53.921 --> 00:14:55.387
- Fine.
- Fine.


219
00:14:55.389 --> 00:14:57.756
That's why this company
is what it is.


220
00:14:57.758 --> 00:15:00.191
- Rock and roll.
- I don't mind...


221
00:15:00.193 --> 00:15:04.595
- I don't mind...
- If this is a hump,


222
00:15:04.597 --> 00:15:07.898
I'm willing to help him get
over this hump. I just...


223
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.532
I don't know how long
this hump is gonna...


224
00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:11.767
What I mind is being a fool.
It's a big hump.


225
00:15:11.769 --> 00:15:16.304
Did you have your feet bound?
No.


226
00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.573
No. I think we should
perform an intervention.


227
00:15:19.575 --> 00:15:21.608
And I know that most of the
time they're not successful,


228
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:25.545
but I think that this is
something we should try for him.


229
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.314
Hey, Rose, it's Alex.

230
00:15:29.316 --> 00:15:32.183
- I know it.
- You can't talk.


231
00:15:32.185 --> 00:15:35.586
I wasn't sure if it was
today or tomorrow.


232
00:15:35.588 --> 00:15:38.755
If we're one for today,
say something like...


233
00:15:38.757 --> 00:15:41.257
You have a bad connection.

234
00:15:41.259 --> 00:15:46.495
Mary, I can't hear
you. We have a bad connection.


235
00:15:46.497 --> 00:15:47.863
Let me speak to
Mary.


236
00:15:47.865 --> 00:15:49.664
Listen, Lauren wants to
talk to you.


237
00:15:49.666 --> 00:15:53.534
Gimme the phone.
Mary. Hello?


238
00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:56.370
- Hello? Mary.
- Hello.


239
00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:59.339
- Go back to it.
- Hello.


240
00:16:01.843 --> 00:16:03.209
Jeff, man.
How's it goin', dude?


241
00:16:03.211 --> 00:16:06.946
I stumbled into it... Hey, Randy.
It's really good shit.


242
00:16:06.948 --> 00:16:09.915
- When I was younger.
- Move on...


243
00:16:09.917 --> 00:16:11.816
From the jungles
of Bolivia.


244
00:16:11.818 --> 00:16:14.819
ROSE I understand, I know
I'm a burden to you.


245
00:16:16.055 --> 00:16:20.123
I don't wanna be.
I'm trying, you know.


246
00:16:21.226 --> 00:16:22.692
I'm trying.

247
00:16:22.694 --> 00:16:27.129
I can't handle
this anymore.


248
00:16:27.131 --> 00:16:30.599
I can't handle the
pressure.


249
00:16:30.601 --> 00:16:32.534
How does it make you feel?
Supposed to be.


250
00:16:32.536 --> 00:16:36.504
You're supposed to
be the good thing in my life.


251
00:16:36.506 --> 00:16:40.774
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, right
now, I have this feeling...


252
00:16:40.776 --> 00:16:43.810
Well, I'm sorry I'm the bag
thing in your life, Lauren.


253
00:16:43.812 --> 00:16:46.112
- No.
- I truly am.


254
00:16:46.114 --> 00:16:49.348
No, no. Look me
in the eye. Right now.


255
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:52.617
Look me in the eye and tell
me that there is no one else.


256
00:16:54.621 --> 00:16:57.188
Tell me th...
You didn't tell me.


257
00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:01.325
I love you. I love you, too. I do.
So, look me in the eye...


258
00:17:01.327 --> 00:17:03.560
and tell me.

259
00:17:05.564 --> 00:17:09.666
- Stop this.
- See you can't do it.


260
00:17:09.668 --> 00:17:13.569
Look, there's no one
else in my life, Lauren.


261
00:17:14.738 --> 00:17:17.004
You happy now?

262
00:17:17.406 --> 00:17:19.239
There's no one else,
you swear.


263
00:17:19.241 --> 00:17:23.443
How many times? There's
no one else. I swear.


264
00:17:25.046 --> 00:17:30.449
I don't know how to swear to
you. I don't know how to...


265
00:17:30.451 --> 00:17:32.417
I just don't know what to
do anymore. I mean...


266
00:17:32.419 --> 00:17:35.119
Okay, that's fine.

267
00:17:42.995 --> 00:17:45.895
- Morning, everybody.
- Hey, hey.


268
00:17:46.731 --> 00:17:49.498
Hey. How was the trip?

269
00:17:58.709 --> 00:18:03.812
I'm sorry I'm late.
The traffic was, uh...


270
00:18:04.648 --> 00:18:07.782
- So what do we have?
- We got a full plate.


271
00:18:07.784 --> 00:18:11.018
I got a lot of stuff
we all read last night.


272
00:18:12.688 --> 00:18:14.921
Right? Get some opinions.

273
00:18:15.456 --> 00:18:17.456
Has anyone seen Maria?

274
00:18:17.691 --> 00:18:18.756
Yeah.
Is she under the chair?


275
00:18:18.758 --> 00:18:22.392
She's being stepped on.
I love you so much.


276
00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:28.431
- Dirty subject.
- Tell me.


277
00:18:28.433 --> 00:18:30.966
Yes. That's not
realistic.


278
00:18:30.968 --> 00:18:33.268
The fact that Alex
drinks so much...


279
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.270
That was the typing.

280
00:18:35.272 --> 00:18:37.505
Why don't they
ever make movies like...


281
00:18:37.507 --> 00:18:39.640
There's no movies for
Latinos. Jennifer Lopez.


282
00:18:39.642 --> 00:18:42.943
Yeah, as a maid?
As a promiscuous maid?


283
00:18:42.945 --> 00:18:45.912
Well, what... Listen. Ask
us when you wanna play...


284
00:18:45.914 --> 00:18:50.917
Okay. So...
what about...


285
00:18:52.587 --> 00:18:54.853
<i>In A Box</i>.

286
00:18:54.955 --> 00:18:57.155
An amazing script.
I haven't read a good script


287
00:18:57.157 --> 00:18:58.122
like this since
<i>The Color Purple.</i>


288
00:18:58.124 --> 00:19:03.861
And <i>Cosign.</i> It's a group of
frustrated black actors in Hollywood.


289
00:19:03.863 --> 00:19:05.629
They get so enraged with...

290
00:19:05.631 --> 00:19:08.832
with feeling isolated, with
feeling marginalized, tired of


291
00:19:08.834 --> 00:19:11.634
being the token splash of
color in a movie and they...


292
00:19:11.636 --> 00:19:15.037
they just embody this Marcus
Garvey period,


293
00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:17.739
you know, back to Africa,
while they're having coffee...


294
00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:19.407
Sometimes I'm just
living in my own head.


295
00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:24.378
Pat, could you pull over when you see
a newsstand? And I don't understand.


296
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.779
I need cigarettes
A lot of the world.


297
00:19:25.781 --> 00:19:30.016
Black people are more than just gangs
and shooting each other's brains...


298
00:19:30.018 --> 00:19:31.384
No. You know, that's not
what I'm talkin' about.


299
00:19:31.386 --> 00:19:34.487
No, what you're saying, Evan, is that
you only think blacks are commercial


300
00:19:34.489 --> 00:19:36.355
when they're shooting each
other's brains. I mean...


301
00:19:36.357 --> 00:19:37.622
No, you know perfectly
well that's not what...


302
00:19:37.624 --> 00:19:39.590
Blacks can be multi-dimensional.
Okay. We'll move on.


303
00:19:39.592 --> 00:19:42.659
This is an issue that has got
great crossover potential.


304
00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:45.161
This is about the black
diaspora.


305
00:19:45.163 --> 00:19:46.996
This is what Hollywood.

306
00:19:46.998 --> 00:19:50.332
It's a good show. Crossover lead.
Will Smith is accessible.


307
00:19:50.334 --> 00:19:55.403
I mean, it's really
difficult for, uh... very


308
00:19:55.405 --> 00:19:59.940
very demanding part
very full, rich you know,


309
00:19:59.942 --> 00:20:02.075
she tries to kill herself,

310
00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:04.510
she's a slut, she's a bitch,

311
00:20:05.279 --> 00:20:07.312
She has a heart of gold and...

312
00:20:07.314 --> 00:20:12.050
To play all those notes, it really would
be better if you had read the script.


313
00:20:12.052 --> 00:20:14.285
But you didn't, so, um...

314
00:20:14.287 --> 00:20:15.052
Too far gone?

315
00:20:15.054 --> 00:20:18.121
Oh, that... that... that's the...
that's the... <i>The Shine</i>.


316
00:20:18.123 --> 00:20:20.289
<i>- The Shine</i>.
- Except the guy's got,


317
00:20:20.291 --> 00:20:23.592
- a lot more problems.
- More problems.


318
00:20:23.594 --> 00:20:24.826
I would love you anyway.

319
00:20:24.828 --> 00:20:27.562
The man you love and
he's leaving forever.


320
00:20:27.564 --> 00:20:29.564
Can we do a little improv?
Do you mind? Yeah.


321
00:20:29.566 --> 00:20:33.968
Uh, Zee, can you... do you mind
if you're a boat? Just be a boat.


322
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:37.871
Yeah. You know. Here.
Here you go. A boat. Right?


323
00:20:37.873 --> 00:20:43.676
What's the tone of the movie? Is it
just sort of, like, comedy or drama?


324
00:20:43.678 --> 00:20:44.510
Drama. Drama.

325
00:20:44.512 --> 00:20:48.847
It's a very deep, rich
melodrama and, uh, this...


326
00:20:48.849 --> 00:20:51.482
this... a lot of sex, but

327
00:20:51.684 --> 00:20:54.885
the sex is routed in the storyline and
it's all based upon her character


328
00:20:54.887 --> 00:20:58.990
because she's sleeping her way to the
top of the public relations firm in


329
00:20:58.992 --> 00:21:01.525
uh, in Saint Louis,
Missouri.


330
00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:05.828
Patch, lock the doors.

331
00:21:30.321 --> 00:21:35.924
<i>Hello? Hello? Check. One, two.
Hello. Hello? Check, check,</i>


332
00:21:37.193 --> 00:21:40.227
<i>Check, check, check,
check, check, check.</i>


333
00:21:43.232 --> 00:21:45.665
I still see the
innocent girl you used to be


334
00:21:45.667 --> 00:21:48.434
before Amanda got killed
in that tragic boat accident.


335
00:21:48.436 --> 00:21:49.968
I think that it's
a very ugly place.


336
00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.304
Oh, God Jason, it feels so
good to unburden myself.


337
00:21:53.306 --> 00:21:58.108
I think sometimes there
are moments of real beauty.


338
00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:02.412
- Unlock the door.
- Like a smile.


339
00:22:02.414 --> 00:22:05.181
Hm. A smile.
ROSE Why'd you lock the door.


340
00:22:05.183 --> 00:22:09.518
- What else?
- Love all over again.


341
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.655
- Falling asleep together.
- Very nice. Sorry.


342
00:22:13.657 --> 00:22:16.124
After all your lies...

343
00:22:16.726 --> 00:22:18.926
Now that I've found
you, I do.


344
00:22:18.928 --> 00:22:20.761
Your lover.

345
00:22:20.896 --> 00:22:22.262
...where the conflict
happened.


346
00:22:22.264 --> 00:22:25.565
And so that would mean that
the people who watch the.


347
00:22:25.567 --> 00:22:27.166
History Channel they would
probably watch this movie.


348
00:22:27.168 --> 00:22:28.800
- Knowing you're loved.
- But it also catches


349
00:22:28.802 --> 00:22:33.304
the teen market because it's a boy and
girl who have just finished their


350
00:22:33.306 --> 00:22:36.540
freshman year at Harvard and they're in...
the... the bush, and this girl


351
00:22:36.542 --> 00:22:39.409
is shaving her legs... long, brown legs.
Been in the bush for an, uh, a


352
00:22:39.411 --> 00:22:42.178
few weeks and she's
shaving the slit.


353
00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:46.649
Blood trickling down. Big pool
of blood. A lotta blood.


354
00:22:46.651 --> 00:22:48.684
And... and... and... and...
and then you cut to like


355
00:22:48.686 --> 00:22:51.420
a wide shot and she and her
boyfriend on the banks of this...


356
00:22:51.422 --> 00:22:55.557
Renee, is there a script on this?
So far?


357
00:22:55.559 --> 00:22:57.825
So far? That they
get into the river


358
00:22:57.827 --> 00:23:00.594
and the... the camera, like,
gushes down below the water.


359
00:23:00.596 --> 00:23:05.065
It's mur... murky, muddy... Sweetie,
do we have a script on this? Can we


360
00:23:05.067 --> 00:23:06.533
just... Is it something we can read?
There's a worm.


361
00:23:06.535 --> 00:23:11.037
It's like... like a glass noodle
worm, like the kind usually...


362
00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:12.905
- That's sounds really...
- In Japanese


363
00:23:12.907 --> 00:23:16.575
restaurants, you know, the glass
noodle worm. I mean, noodles? And...


364
00:23:16.577 --> 00:23:18.209
and that's what the worm is like...
What about... what


365
00:23:18.211 --> 00:23:20.978
about the whole <i>South Park</i> thing?
Are we excited about that?


366
00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.381
- Oh, I like that.
<i>- South Park</i>?


367
00:23:24.383 --> 00:23:27.250
<i>South Park</i>? Oh, well,
the <i>South Park</i> thing is... is


368
00:23:27.252 --> 00:23:31.654
kind of exciting to me. Alex,
I'd love for you to chime in.


369
00:23:31.656 --> 00:23:33.789
This has got to me by
Debbie Weavling.


370
00:23:33.791 --> 00:23:35.891
And, uh, this is the
<i>South Park</i> guys,


371
00:23:35.893 --> 00:23:39.227
Matt Stone, Trey Parker.
They've written a script.


372
00:23:39.229 --> 00:23:45.299
Granted the title might... it's
a working title, <i>Time Toilet</i>.


373
00:23:45.301 --> 00:23:49.002
Essentially <i>Time Toilet</i> is...
a janitor working on a nuclear


374
00:23:49.004 --> 00:23:54.741
energy facility discovers that the
toilet of the men's room is actually


375
00:23:54.743 --> 00:23:57.777
a time portal and they've been
inadvertently flushing


376
00:23:57.779 --> 00:24:02.948
waste products back in time. Subtly
changing time. Obviously, this is


377
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:07.252
a sci-fi comedy with historical,
uh, value because there are


378
00:24:07.254 --> 00:24:12.323
there are several, um, tableaux that
we hit upon. Most notably is the, uh,


379
00:24:12.325 --> 00:24:15.826
assassination of Lincoln which is foiled
because just as John Wilkes Booth


380
00:24:15.828 --> 00:24:19.496
is raising his pistol to the back
of our sixteenth President's head,


381
00:24:19.498 --> 00:24:23.433
Whoosh. Wilkes Booth is
washed with waste, uh,


382
00:24:23.435 --> 00:24:26.602
flushed from today back then.

383
00:24:26.604 --> 00:24:29.504
That would be Mrs. Lincoln.
So now he has to


384
00:24:29.506 --> 00:24:33.341
flush himself back in time to kill Lincoln.
So that's our hero.


385
00:24:33.343 --> 00:24:37.912
Great. It is a good opportunity.

386
00:24:37.914 --> 00:24:40.948
Yeah. It's cameos, it's historical,
it's educational and it's


387
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.851
funny as hell. You like it?

388
00:24:44.853 --> 00:24:46.118
I love it.

389
00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:50.822
Oh, my God.
I love Johnny Depp.


390
00:24:51.658 --> 00:24:55.192
I saw him the other night at the
Viper Room and he is so hot.


391
00:24:55.194 --> 00:24:58.562
Great soundtrack. We can "<i>Bill and
Ted</i>" the whole thing, you know?


392
00:24:58.564 --> 00:25:00.830
Garbage. I don't even
listen to garbage.


393
00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:04.500
- Cornhole.
- Cornhole!


394
00:25:04.502 --> 00:25:08.270
What do we think of
Ricky Skaggs?


395
00:25:08.272 --> 00:25:12.274
I...I... I... I...I

396
00:25:12.843 --> 00:25:14.042
No. Right? We hate it.

397
00:25:14.044 --> 00:25:16.310
He wants to
hang out and read it again.


398
00:25:16.312 --> 00:25:18.245
Do you have a tissue,
please?


399
00:25:18.247 --> 00:25:21.715
- Break a leg.
- You break a leg.


400
00:25:21.717 --> 00:25:24.918
Um, I, uh, d... did

401
00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.956
you f... feel something...
sh... shaking?


402
00:25:29.958 --> 00:25:32.158
- BPT.
- BPT?


403
00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.160
Best People in Town.

404
00:25:34.162 --> 00:25:36.562
Then wouldn't it be...

405
00:25:36.564 --> 00:25:39.631
I'm just curious.
But didn't you think that...


406
00:25:39.633 --> 00:25:40.565
Whatever script that was
you read...


407
00:25:40.567 --> 00:25:43.000
Really?
That's your agency?


408
00:25:43.002 --> 00:25:44.935
Well, I wish it

409
00:25:44.937 --> 00:25:47.637
was my agency. I...

410
00:25:48.039 --> 00:25:51.073
Wouldn't that be
BP... I... T?


411
00:25:51.075 --> 00:25:56.778
Well, you know, Best People Tell.
I don't know, Lauren.


412
00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.180
But it's better than nothing.

413
00:26:06.921 --> 00:26:11.089
Don't worry. I'll get an agent.
I know you will.


414
00:26:11.391 --> 00:26:12.857
And what's this part
you're auditioning for?


415
00:26:12.859 --> 00:26:16.694
I'm auditioning
for the part of a teacher.


416
00:26:17.363 --> 00:26:18.261
Dressed like that?

417
00:26:18.263 --> 00:26:22.265
Who used to be a shepherd.
Dressed like that?


418
00:26:23.001 --> 00:26:26.869
She wanted to be a
teacher all her life and...


419
00:26:27.271 --> 00:26:33.441
She's young, 18 years old, a
brilliant genius director.


420
00:26:33.443 --> 00:26:35.309
I just can't over the
fact that...


421
00:26:35.311 --> 00:26:37.911
- Meeting today?
- She is so young.


422
00:26:37.913 --> 00:26:39.746
What were we all
doing at 18?


423
00:26:39.748 --> 00:26:41.581
I think I was
collecting stickers.


424
00:26:41.583 --> 00:26:43.716
She's makin' a movie
for thirty thousand that


425
00:26:43.718 --> 00:26:48.754
- translates to... what is it?
- Sixty million.


426
00:26:48.756 --> 00:26:50.922
- Grossed $60 million.
- Not bad.


427
00:26:50.924 --> 00:26:54.358
So she would read books
as she was tending the sheep.


428
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.260
While she was
preparing herself...


429
00:26:57.262 --> 00:26:59.895
Yeah. That's right,
she did all the music.


430
00:26:59.897 --> 00:27:02.497
The owner of the ranch
where she tended the sheep


431
00:27:02.499 --> 00:27:04.999
- had many kids.
- Like seven?


432
00:27:05.001 --> 00:27:10.170
The youngest one... He has seven children.
Like seven? She had...


433
00:27:10.172 --> 00:27:12.438
The youngest one
got into an accident...


434
00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:16.275
He almost drowned and she saves his life.
So the owner of the


435
00:27:16.277 --> 00:27:20.512
<i>hacienda</i> asks her what she wants
in return for saving his son.


436
00:27:20.514 --> 00:27:22.447
- Hi.
- How old are you?


437
00:27:22.449 --> 00:27:27.151
- She says...
- ...the documentary...


438
00:27:27.153 --> 00:27:30.621
- Oh, no.
- It's amazing.


439
00:27:30.623 --> 00:27:34.157
I've seen pictures of her. She's beautiful.
She's coming in today.


440
00:27:34.159 --> 00:27:37.059
Is she really? Yeah. Oh, wow.

441
00:27:37.061 --> 00:27:39.461
- You're 40, yeah?
- No, no, like 45.


442
00:27:39.463 --> 00:27:40.161
Uh, I... I'm... 41.

443
00:27:40.163 --> 00:27:44.965
Alex, the thing about Ana is that
she's got European sensibilities.


444
00:27:44.967 --> 00:27:45.532
Hurray!

445
00:27:45.534 --> 00:27:47.300
She's Italian... Venezuelan.
A combination of three things.


446
00:27:47.302 --> 00:27:50.336
But she speaks five languages and we
thought you'd be able to talk to her.


447
00:27:50.338 --> 00:27:53.272
She doesn't really look Egyptian.
She looks like a mutt.


448
00:27:53.274 --> 00:27:55.641
She speaks intellectual.
She speaks smart.


449
00:27:55.643 --> 00:27:59.444
I forgot to tell you that his
wife had died. Of course.


450
00:27:59.446 --> 00:28:01.946
I think I've seen
this. Is this a musical?


451
00:28:01.948 --> 00:28:05.182
She's like a big wad
of cash with a head on it.


452
00:28:05.184 --> 00:28:06.950
Yeah. She's gonna
walk in our door.


453
00:28:06.952 --> 00:28:09.686
Did you read the script?
I read it.


454
00:28:09.688 --> 00:28:12.288
I never saw you
read the script.


455
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:17.760
'Cause I didn't read the script,
Lauren, I read the synopsis.


456
00:28:17.762 --> 00:28:18.360
Why?

457
00:28:18.362 --> 00:28:21.563
I don't even know why I bother.
Did I lose my mind?


458
00:28:21.565 --> 00:28:23.631
Of course not, they're
gonna give me a scene.


459
00:28:23.633 --> 00:28:29.169
That I will see for the first time
and then I... I'm very good... but


460
00:28:29.171 --> 00:28:33.206
I'll just, um, I'll read
off the page.


461
00:28:33.208 --> 00:28:36.375
An Asian, a black girl, I want a
white girl. I want to give you


462
00:28:36.377 --> 00:28:41.413
- the whole gamut of racial...
- Wait, wait, wait,


463
00:28:41.415 --> 00:28:43.548
Wait. Wait. Wait.

464
00:28:44.417 --> 00:28:47.684
Poor white trash...

465
00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.120
If you cast a
black woman... You know.


466
00:28:51.122 --> 00:28:54.289
We talked about this. You're
taking bitch out of the title.


467
00:28:54.291 --> 00:28:57.358
Oh. Okay. All right. But
it's just derogatory.


468
00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:01.228
- That's a good idea.
- I thought we liked this.


469
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:03.230
I kind of like bitch.

470
00:29:03.232 --> 00:29:05.131
- I... I like bitch.
- I like bitch.


471
00:29:05.133 --> 00:29:10.202
- Dressed like that?
- Anywhere I dress...


472
00:29:10.204 --> 00:29:13.138
I mean, doesn't matter how I dress. I am...
I am still the right person


473
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.672
for the part. You
want some respect?


474
00:29:14.674 --> 00:29:18.475
Yes. And I will earn it with my acting.
Well, why don't


475
00:29:18.477 --> 00:29:22.278
you earn it right now by just
covering up your breasts.


476
00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:22.945
I can change it.

477
00:29:22.947 --> 00:29:27.749
I mean this word takes so much negativity.
I mean, with female violence? Battery?


478
00:29:27.751 --> 00:29:30.785
- You like this, right?
- Abuse.


479
00:29:30.787 --> 00:29:31.552
I'm a bad person.

480
00:29:31.554 --> 00:29:35.556
It would make me feel good.
No, I'm doin' it.


481
00:29:35.558 --> 00:29:38.492
Stop the nagging
and I'll do it.


482
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:44.463
There, happy?

483
00:29:44.665 --> 00:29:47.999
- See you at home later.
- No, I'll wait on you.


484
00:29:48.001 --> 00:29:51.435
Oh, no, no, no. No, I
thought we were gonna do.


485
00:29:51.437 --> 00:29:53.236
Oh, I can give you
instruction...


486
00:29:53.238 --> 00:29:55.171
What made you
think that?


487
00:29:55.173 --> 00:29:57.206
No. You're going
home and I'll meet you there.


488
00:29:57.208 --> 00:29:58.473
Or you're going wherever
you were going...


489
00:29:58.475 --> 00:30:01.042
What are you talking about?
You're wasting our time.


490
00:30:01.044 --> 00:30:02.910
Darren why do they call
it a budget?


491
00:30:02.912 --> 00:30:05.512
They call it a budget so
you don't budge from it.


492
00:30:05.514 --> 00:30:07.780
It works every time.

493
00:30:07.782 --> 00:30:10.849
Thanks for the ride. I'll be out here.
I'm gonna be out here.


494
00:30:10.851 --> 00:30:15.854
No. Readin' the paper. I got
a lot of business to do.


495
00:30:15.856 --> 00:30:17.222
Have a good audition.

496
00:30:17.224 --> 00:30:20.625
- I might be a long time.
- Okay. I'll be here.


497
00:30:25.098 --> 00:30:26.530
From 21 to 18 day
shoot. Right?


498
00:30:26.532 --> 00:30:29.633
Weren't we talkin' about that
last time on the telephone?


499
00:30:29.635 --> 00:30:31.635
Yeah.
Twenty-one to 18.


500
00:30:31.637 --> 00:30:34.804
Wait, wait. We were
talkin' about 24 days.


501
00:30:34.806 --> 00:30:37.406
We talked about 21.
Now it's down to 18.


502
00:30:37.408 --> 00:30:39.408
Alex, wh... what...

503
00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:40.142
Can you do in 18?

504
00:30:40.144 --> 00:30:45.614
18 days, I can do it better. I'm
gonna give you a better product.


505
00:30:45.616 --> 00:30:48.383
All right, uh, okay, good, good.
Keep it raw and gritty.


506
00:30:48.385 --> 00:30:49.784
That's what your style was?
Man, that's your grandpa.


507
00:30:49.786 --> 00:30:53.654
Okay, no problem and no... I mean,
I'll use my handheld... I... I...


508
00:30:53.656 --> 00:30:55.522
Let's do
it for 30,000.


509
00:30:55.524 --> 00:30:57.690
The film should make 60 million, right?
So you can do it for 18.


510
00:30:57.692 --> 00:31:00.759
Okay. Okay. Production values are
not gonna suffer. Believe me.


511
00:31:00.761 --> 00:31:04.162
You're gonna love
this rock and roll.


512
00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.997
Welcome. What can she
do in 18 days? A lot.


513
00:31:06.999 --> 00:31:08.198
Can I talk about the
ending?


514
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.999
I was thinkin' about changing
the ending. I had some ideas.


515
00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:13.236
Oh, oh. I think a
feel-good happy ending...


516
00:31:13.238 --> 00:31:15.438
No, no, no.

517
00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.773
Lester, let's stick to
the plan...


518
00:31:17.775 --> 00:31:22.277
I think we need to
stick to what is written


519
00:31:22.279 --> 00:31:26.047
and you have to work within those
boundaries the way you work so well.


520
00:31:26.049 --> 00:31:26.680
Okay.

521
00:31:26.682 --> 00:31:30.650
Provided you're at peak form
and you're in your health...


522
00:31:30.652 --> 00:31:34.253
- Right, right.
- And all that...


523
00:31:36.156 --> 00:31:39.123
You got some friends. You'll
be able to pull some names...


524
00:31:39.125 --> 00:31:40.824
- You an actress?
- Yeah.


525
00:31:40.826 --> 00:31:43.827
Are you here for the audition?
Mm-hm.


526
00:31:43.829 --> 00:31:46.830
- You're pretty.
- You're pretty.


527
00:31:46.832 --> 00:31:50.900
- No, you're beautiful.
- You think so?


528
00:31:50.902 --> 00:31:54.637
Whoa, whoa. What... what
do you mean two days?


529
00:31:54.639 --> 00:31:56.739
- Why are you sweating?
- I'm not sweating.


530
00:31:56.741 --> 00:31:59.141
But what do you mean two days
in turnaround? Alex...


531
00:31:59.143 --> 00:32:04.379
Alex, what... what is that two days
in turnaround business? What is this?


532
00:32:04.381 --> 00:32:06.114
Sorry, Lester,
you only have two days,


533
00:32:06.116 --> 00:32:07.582
but you can cast it in
two days, couldn't you?


534
00:32:07.584 --> 00:32:09.884
I've been tryin' since
I... this is my fifth week and.


535
00:32:09.886 --> 00:32:13.454
- I haven't casted 'em yet.
- You'll manage.


536
00:32:13.456 --> 00:32:17.524
Lester, you're clean,
aren't ya?


537
00:32:19.927 --> 00:32:23.028
You're clean, right?
I mean...


538
00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:24.229
We're all adults here.
Um, there's... there's


539
00:32:24.231 --> 00:32:28.266
been a couple rumors and, uh, I just wanted
to make sure you're not using again.


540
00:32:28.268 --> 00:32:30.735
No. I'm not using...
Of course, I'm not using.


541
00:32:30.737 --> 00:32:33.838
Everyone takes a cast and crew
physical before we go into production.


542
00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.708
- Are you trying to...
- Insurance purposes.


543
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:41.445
I'll be right with ya. What
are you talkin' about?


544
00:32:46.885 --> 00:32:50.019
I don't think he's
using.


545
00:32:50.021 --> 00:32:51.954
We're pretty much done,
aren't we?


546
00:32:51.956 --> 00:32:57.025
We'll show you...
our arms if you show us yours.


547
00:32:58.528 --> 00:33:00.861
Take notes, Connie, really.
The other one.


548
00:33:00.863 --> 00:33:01.928
I...I wanted to
talk to you...


549
00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:03.996
EVAN. The other one. The other one.
All right. No, no,


550
00:33:03.998 --> 00:33:05.564
- Come on, come on.
- Show us the other arm.


551
00:33:05.566 --> 00:33:07.232
- This is a joke...
- There's your answer.


552
00:33:07.234 --> 00:33:08.600
Alex, what's going on?

553
00:33:08.602 --> 00:33:10.635
There's your answer.

554
00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:17.508
- All right, screening.
- So what you been up to?


555
00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:21.144
Screen test is in...
Okay. And I'll see you there.


556
00:33:21.246 --> 00:33:24.013
Just wanted to say
hello.


557
00:33:24.281 --> 00:33:26.314
Yeah.

558
00:33:26.849 --> 00:33:28.982
Alex, come on, man.
What is that shit? Two


559
00:33:28.984 --> 00:33:32.585
days? Two days I've been tryin'
to get this for five weeks now.


560
00:33:32.587 --> 00:33:35.421
Don't worry... Two days. What
do you mean don't worry?


561
00:33:35.423 --> 00:33:39.258
If I didn't know you so well,
I'd think you were a racist.


562
00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:42.561
- You're pushing it.
- No I'm not pushing it.


563
00:33:45.465 --> 00:33:46.964
- What?
- What're you doing?


564
00:33:46.966 --> 00:33:49.466
I gotta see my wife.
Uh, I'll talk to you later.


565
00:33:49.468 --> 00:33:53.169
So you'll come back?
Are you gonna come back...


566
00:33:56.807 --> 00:34:00.608
So, no
flowers, no cards,


567
00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:06.213
no presents and not even a phone call
and it was my birthday yesterday.


568
00:34:07.716 --> 00:34:11.017
- You're full of shit.
- I am.


569
00:34:11.352 --> 00:34:15.454
But if it would have been my
birthday, would you have called?


570
00:34:15.456 --> 00:34:16.388
Okay, kids, uh, you

571
00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:18.723
wanna hear the good news or
you wanna hear the bad news?


572
00:34:18.725 --> 00:34:20.858
- Good news always.
- All right, the good


573
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.561
news is there ain't no good news.
There's only bad news. I got two days


574
00:34:24.563 --> 00:34:26.863
to cast this movie or
they're pullin' the plug.


575
00:34:26.865 --> 00:34:30.066
They cut my days
down from 24 to 21 days.


576
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:35.137
And they think I'm fuckin' usin'
drugs again, God dammit. Fuck!


577
00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:38.406
Lester, you are
using drugs again.


578
00:34:38.975 --> 00:34:40.341
I've been thinking.

579
00:34:40.343 --> 00:34:43.410
If I took a couple weeks off,
maybe a month.


580
00:34:44.513 --> 00:34:49.215
We could just take a plane
to Venice.


581
00:34:50.117 --> 00:34:58.022
Or Florence. A plane to Florence and then
drive south for a couple of hours and, uh,


582
00:34:58.024 --> 00:35:03.260
and rent a villa, maybe in Chianti
or why not by the coast. You know?


583
00:35:03.996 --> 00:35:11.101
Cook our own food and no scripts,
no cell phones, no faxes.


584
00:35:11.103 --> 00:35:17.240
Only books that can't be made into movies.
And we'll swim naked.


585
00:35:19.611 --> 00:35:25.748
I'll lick the salt off your body
while you're drying in the sun.


586
00:35:31.455 --> 00:35:33.354
Can I look?

587
00:35:36.325 --> 00:35:40.393
Yeah. Of course you can
look. Look in the top drawer.


588
00:35:40.395 --> 00:35:44.363
...money to accomplish
all my desires.


589
00:35:44.365 --> 00:35:48.834
I now have enough time
and energy...


590
00:35:48.836 --> 00:35:52.070
To accomplish all
my desires.


591
00:35:52.272 --> 00:35:59.477
I am the calm, especially the
peace, and I see love in everyone.


592
00:35:59.479 --> 00:36:04.515
I am the calm,
especially the peace,


593
00:36:04.517 --> 00:36:07.784
and I see love in everyone.

594
00:36:07.786 --> 00:36:11.921
I am the calm, especially the
peace, and I see love in everyone.


595
00:36:11.923 --> 00:36:16.659
It's very hard to stop drinking
when you're not at home.


596
00:36:17.695 --> 00:36:20.562
You know, I can't... I can't
work, I can't sleep.


597
00:36:20.564 --> 00:36:24.165
I believe in infinite <i>aboondance</i>.
Abundance.


598
00:36:24.167 --> 00:36:26.634
And the money is always
there...


599
00:36:26.636 --> 00:36:29.970
You know what I think
we should do? We should...


600
00:36:29.972 --> 00:36:32.639
We should buy a
house.


601
00:36:32.641 --> 00:36:35.875
Buy a house in Tuscany,

602
00:36:35.977 --> 00:36:40.846
and move there. You don't
like L.A. anyway, do ya?


603
00:36:40.848 --> 00:36:48.453
Moving to London is not such a good idea.
So let's... let's leave this town.


604
00:36:52.325 --> 00:36:53.924
For all the radiation
in her earlobe.


605
00:36:53.926 --> 00:36:58.862
- Do you love me?
- Is that what you think?


606
00:37:00.665 --> 00:37:04.133
What I think is not the
point. Do you love me?


607
00:37:04.135 --> 00:37:06.668
I accept it. No.

608
00:37:08.471 --> 00:37:09.236
Every day I...

609
00:37:09.238 --> 00:37:15.475
I wish I didn't love you quite so much.
Every day...


610
00:37:15.477 --> 00:37:18.845
Well, then, I think we
should live together


611
00:37:19.013 --> 00:37:21.079
and I think you should
come back home.


612
00:37:21.081 --> 00:37:22.113
Every day...

613
00:37:22.115 --> 00:37:26.917
And we'll...
work things out.


614
00:37:29.788 --> 00:37:34.657
I know that you've been a bit
unbalanced lately, but,


615
00:37:34.659 --> 00:37:36.392
uh, maybe you should see
someone, talk to someone.


616
00:37:36.394 --> 00:37:43.031
Alex? You're with us at the screening?
Yeah, sure.


617
00:37:43.366 --> 00:37:47.267
Sorry to interrupt. I
am vibrantly healthy...


618
00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:52.939
Jesus. I wanna
get outta here.


619
00:37:55.843 --> 00:38:00.278
I am vibrantly healthy...
What do you say?


620
00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.913
I am vibrantly...

621
00:38:04.783 --> 00:38:09.585
I am always in the right
place at the right time.


622
00:38:10.988 --> 00:38:16.157
I am always at the right
place at the right time.


623
00:38:23.264 --> 00:38:26.598
Okay, okay. Okay.
It's okay. It's okay.


624
00:38:34.007 --> 00:38:37.141
It's okay, it's okay.

625
00:38:51.924 --> 00:38:54.724
- Alex?
- Yeah.


626
00:38:54.926 --> 00:38:57.693
I'm going to leave you.

627
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.399
Yeah.

628
00:39:10.338 --> 00:39:12.604
I understand.

629
00:39:13.707 --> 00:39:19.077
Get out, get out of
there. It's me. I'm outside.


630
00:39:19.179 --> 00:39:22.146
Puppy, go home. I'll
take a taxi. It'll be okay.


631
00:39:22.148 --> 00:39:24.815
No, no, come on out.

632
00:39:40.566 --> 00:39:45.602
ROSE. Puppy, I'm in line, I have
to go in and do my audition.


633
00:39:45.604 --> 00:39:49.872
You don't understand,
it's not worth it.


634
00:39:50.441 --> 00:39:53.175
Puppy, go home.

635
00:39:54.545 --> 00:39:57.279
You don't know how hard
it was to get this audition.


636
00:39:57.281 --> 00:39:59.681
I cannot do that.
I'll be fine.


637
00:39:59.683 --> 00:40:03.418
Just go home. I'll take a
taxi. It'll be okay.


638
00:40:05.288 --> 00:40:08.122
Hello? Yeah, hi Bunny.

639
00:40:08.124 --> 00:40:09.056
<i>Hey, how you doing?</i>

640
00:40:09.058 --> 00:40:14.528
Oh, just fine. How you doing?
<i>It's making me crazy.</i>


641
00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:16.363
Yeah. This is a...

642
00:40:16.365 --> 00:40:18.231
<i>I'm a little early.
I'm outside your offices.</i>


643
00:40:18.233 --> 00:40:22.268
<i>I thought if you got a second, why don't
we grab a cup of coffee, something.</i>


644
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:25.537
<i>I wanna talk to you.
Got a minute?</i>


645
00:40:25.539 --> 00:40:28.773
I'm actually in a
meeting right now.


646
00:40:28.775 --> 00:40:30.541
<i>You are. Oh.
All right. All right.</i>


647
00:40:30.543 --> 00:40:32.676
<i>Well, listen, uh, I'll take a rain check.
I wanna get</i>


648
00:40:32.678 --> 00:40:37.914
<i>together with you sort of, you know,
away from all the business. Okay?</i>


649
00:40:37.916 --> 00:40:40.116
- Yeah. Absolutely.
<i>- Great.</i>


650
00:40:40.118 --> 00:40:42.518
<i>Oh, and, um, one other thing.
I wanna give you a heads up.</i>


651
00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:49.525
<i>Ana Powells wants to bring in her
boyfriend into this pitch meeting.</i>


652
00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:53.862
<i>And, uh, you know, normally, I would
say no, but, uh, his name is Joey.</i>


653
00:40:53.864 --> 00:40:56.197
<i>Zee. He's in this band, Walk Don't
Run, and... and, uh, this thing just</i>


654
00:40:56.199 --> 00:40:58.899
<i>went platinum. 
So...</i> Hello? <i>He wants to</i>

655
00:40:58.901 --> 00:41:01.434
<i>do the soundtrack. I think
it will be a great addition.</i>


656
00:41:01.436 --> 00:41:03.402
Hi, how are you? <i>And she seems,
you know, very intent on</i>


657
00:41:03.404 --> 00:41:07.272
<i>having him there, so I thought no
problem, but...</i> Are you a little busy?


658
00:41:07.274 --> 00:41:09.307
<i>Would you do me a
favor and let everybody know?</i>


659
00:41:09.309 --> 00:41:12.209
- Absolutely.
<i>- Great. I think...</i>


660
00:41:12.211 --> 00:41:13.743
<i>uh, and let's see what
they have to offer...</i>


661
00:41:13.745 --> 00:41:18.013
Remember I had that
audition today?


662
00:41:18.015 --> 00:41:23.451
It was good. He wants me to stay and
maybe read it with him again later.


663
00:41:24.053 --> 00:41:28.555
Yeah, yeah.
It's good.


664
00:41:28.557 --> 00:41:32.325
He gave me shit about the script.
See you in half an hour.


665
00:41:32.327 --> 00:41:34.360
<i>- I'll see you in half.</i>
- Okay.


666
00:41:34.362 --> 00:41:36.995
You should've sent it.
<i>Thanks, Alex.</i>


667
00:41:36.997 --> 00:41:40.231
You didn't send the
script.


668
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:52.543
It does matter 'cause this is not
the first time this has happened.


669
00:41:55.714 --> 00:41:57.413
- Alex.
- Hey, Rose.


670
00:41:57.415 --> 00:42:00.617
Where the hell are you?
Listen to me.


671
00:42:00.619 --> 00:42:02.986
Uh, I'm on my
way. I'm in a meeting


672
00:42:02.988 --> 00:42:04.921
right now, but I'll be... I'll be right...
right with you.


673
00:42:04.923 --> 00:42:06.489
Shh. There... there's
people... there's


674
00:42:06.491 --> 00:42:11.227
people in the room. There's
people in the screening room.


675
00:42:11.229 --> 00:42:13.529
What? After
everything I've done?


676
00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:16.565
What?
I forgot about that.


677
00:42:17.167 --> 00:42:23.838
I signed with you,
not with your assistant.


678
00:42:36.452 --> 00:42:38.852
I forgot about that.

679
00:42:51.199 --> 00:42:55.968
If you don't respect
me, then...


680
00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.173
After everything
that's happened.


681
00:43:02.175 --> 00:43:08.646
Because I still see the little girl
might want to come... innocent


682
00:43:08.648 --> 00:43:11.649
one. Before the tragic
accident...


683
00:43:11.651 --> 00:43:12.950
They're here.

684
00:43:12.952 --> 00:43:15.352
- Boating accident.
- What?


685
00:43:15.354 --> 00:43:19.656
I got a better
idea. I'm gonna hang up.


686
00:43:27.866 --> 00:43:30.032
Yeah. The truth...
the truth will - the


687
00:43:30.034 --> 00:43:35.871
- truth will set you free.
- Oh, yes, yes.


688
00:43:40.177 --> 00:43:45.280
What? After all your lies, do
you know who you are anymore?


689
00:43:45.282 --> 00:43:49.717
No, but I found you, I did. Hey.

690
00:43:49.719 --> 00:43:50.219
Oh...

691
00:43:53.756 --> 00:43:56.189
I still believe you.

692
00:43:56.191 --> 00:43:58.424
Oh Jason.

693
00:44:14.374 --> 00:44:19.076
Is this the old Valerie or
is this the new one?


694
00:44:20.312 --> 00:44:24.113
Or is this the new new one?

695
00:44:24.115 --> 00:44:26.949
It's the new new one.

696
00:44:26.951 --> 00:44:33.422
Now that you're here, everything
is brand spanking new new.


697
00:44:38.629 --> 00:44:42.130
Okay and ready, Diamond?
I'm ready.


698
00:44:42.132 --> 00:44:44.132
And action.

699
00:44:44.134 --> 00:44:46.801
- Diamond...
- Actress...


700
00:44:47.403 --> 00:44:49.569
- Hi.
- Hi.


701
00:44:49.571 --> 00:44:52.572
- You have a light?
- A light?


702
00:44:52.574 --> 00:44:55.575
Yes, sure.

703
00:44:58.913 --> 00:45:02.714
I mean, she seems
very... sweet.


704
00:45:02.716 --> 00:45:07.952
- Do I know you?
- Do I know you?


705
00:45:10.623 --> 00:45:12.422
No.

706
00:45:32.043 --> 00:45:34.443
Oh yeah.

707
00:45:37.314 --> 00:45:40.014
It's so good.

708
00:45:47.723 --> 00:45:52.959
Now that I've found you...
I was just...


709
00:45:59.533 --> 00:46:00.665
Just do your lines.

710
00:46:00.667 --> 00:46:04.935
Keep it going, just keep it going.
I have to get more. That... that


711
00:46:04.937 --> 00:46:09.673
orgasm. Orgasm. That's good. Orgasm.
That's good, that's good. Okay,


712
00:46:09.675 --> 00:46:12.409
you can come down now.

713
00:46:18.149 --> 00:46:22.784
Okay. One more... Okay, action.

714
00:46:59.856 --> 00:47:04.925
Everything is
just brand spanking new.


715
00:47:16.371 --> 00:47:19.038
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

716
00:47:19.106 --> 00:47:20.438
One more take.

717
00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.973
Okay, action.

718
00:47:24.576 --> 00:47:27.143
Third one, this is
Jessica...


719
00:47:27.145 --> 00:47:30.579
She's reading for
the bitch's mother?


720
00:47:42.459 --> 00:47:46.194
It feels so good
to unburden myself.


721
00:47:51.167 --> 00:47:54.735
Keep it going.
Oh yes.


722
00:47:54.737 --> 00:47:57.270
I want it, I...

723
00:47:57.272 --> 00:48:02.975
It's supposed to be the first take.
This is the second take.


724
00:48:12.619 --> 00:48:16.520
That's okay,
we can get an idea, Lester.


725
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:22.492
It doesn't matter. She's bad.
She's a bad actress.


726
00:48:52.322 --> 00:48:58.592
Amateur hour. But, um, I thought
I'd give you a racial gamut.


727
00:48:58.594 --> 00:49:03.697
No. Colorblind
auditioning is great.


728
00:49:03.699 --> 00:49:07.167
No? It's good that it's colorblind.
It's, uh, it's tone deaf.


729
00:49:07.169 --> 00:49:09.669
It's all those things.

730
00:49:34.394 --> 00:49:38.996
- Hey.
- I missed you.


731
00:49:43.936 --> 00:49:48.104
I missed
you, too.


732
00:49:56.981 --> 00:50:01.049
O Rose thou art sick.

733
00:50:01.951 --> 00:50:05.786
The invisible worm,
That flies in the night.


734
00:50:05.788 --> 00:50:08.321
In the howling storm:

735
00:50:08.323 --> 00:50:13.426
Has found out thy bed
Of crimson joy:


736
00:50:14.829 --> 00:50:18.931
And his dark secret love.

737
00:50:19.266 --> 00:50:23.968
Does thy life destroy.

738
00:50:24.804 --> 00:50:30.207
That's beautiful. Did
you write that for me?


739
00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:35.078
- Yeah.
- Wow.


740
00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:39.415
Well, I had some help
from a guy named Blake.


741
00:50:40.217 --> 00:50:46.287
It's okay. I made you a cake.
What?


742
00:50:46.289 --> 00:50:50.824
I made you a cake. Yes, you did.

743
00:50:53.028 --> 00:50:55.094
I'm serious. Oh,

744
00:50:55.096 --> 00:50:59.031
glamorous. And it's fat free,
sugar free, too. I hope


745
00:50:59.033 --> 00:51:01.500
you like it there.

746
00:51:02.269 --> 00:51:06.070
I didn't realize that we
had a picnic.


747
00:51:13.279 --> 00:51:19.750
Here. It's vanilla.

748
00:51:21.487 --> 00:51:22.986
Vanilla.
Okay.


749
00:51:22.988 --> 00:51:25.321
Come, come. We're
havin' a...


750
00:51:25.323 --> 00:51:27.656
picnic, darling.

751
00:51:33.864 --> 00:51:40.034
Don't want to forget to put my
underwear on. Really tragic.


752
00:51:41.504 --> 00:51:42.636
We should
find Alex. I don't wanna


753
00:51:42.638 --> 00:51:46.473
start this without Alex. It's just gonna
look bad and I, and I don't want it to


754
00:51:46.475 --> 00:51:50.910
look bad. I want, I want
her to connect with us.


755
00:51:54.115 --> 00:51:59.118
Didn't say a word.
She hardly said a word.


756
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:06.657
I mean, apart from the fact that it looks
bad that he's not here. He's the only one


757
00:52:06.659 --> 00:52:09.693
that knows how to speak that obtuse
language. I mean, I spoke to Bunny


758
00:52:09.695 --> 00:52:13.263
yesterday and he said this girl is
so smart, she's so like speaks in


759
00:52:13.265 --> 00:52:16.266
another code. The other
thing is she may refuse


760
00:52:16.268 --> 00:52:19.269
- to actually meet with us.
- Emma?


761
00:52:21.539 --> 00:52:25.307
Hi. How
are you?


762
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:30.144
Oh, this is an amazing, They're
sugar free, fat free and


763
00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:33.147
everything free. I can't
believe it isn't cake.


764
00:52:33.215 --> 00:52:38.785
And you're telling the truth,
not just saying it. Yeah, I am.


765
00:52:38.787 --> 00:52:42.121
No matter what we agree with,
with, with Anna, we just


766
00:52:42.123 --> 00:52:43.422
support her, her
philosophy and everything.


767
00:52:43.424 --> 00:52:46.958
What they will do. We will
do whatever she wants to do.


768
00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:48.726
- Yeah.
- She's


769
00:52:48.728 --> 00:52:50.494
- fantastic.
- Anna? Uh.


770
00:52:50.496 --> 00:52:52.262
I thought
it was beautiful.


771
00:52:52.264 --> 00:52:54.664
Yeah. That's
good. Save a lot of


772
00:52:54.666 --> 00:52:58.067
money, too. Which is, uh,
makes us all happy. Yeah. How


773
00:52:58.069 --> 00:53:01.870
are you? Oh, I'm good, you know.
Never stop.


774
00:53:01.872 --> 00:53:04.005
- Work, work, work.
- Yeah.


775
00:53:04.007 --> 00:53:08.743
But baby, It's dirty. We just
had sex there. Well, that's


776
00:53:08.745 --> 00:53:12.279
so much better now. I'm
callin' you guys up. It seems


777
00:53:12.281 --> 00:53:15.715
like we hadn't seen you
in forever. But, uh, I, uh,


778
00:53:16.951 --> 00:53:22.054
Pig. And, uh, he always hates,

779
00:53:22.389 --> 00:53:24.489
I'd like to take a minute.
I like the


780
00:53:24.491 --> 00:53:27.625
things you do. Uh, maybe
I should just lay it out


781
00:53:27.627 --> 00:53:29.960
there. I, I, I've heard some
talk, you know. I mean, um-


782
00:53:29.962 --> 00:53:32.595
Do you remember you told me
you were gonna give me that


783
00:53:32.597 --> 00:53:36.465
- audition?
- Did you get it?


784
00:53:36.867 --> 00:53:40.301
I guess when Alex is on, you
know, there's nobody better.


785
00:53:40.303 --> 00:53:43.003
But you're the boss. Yeah. I am

786
00:53:43.005 --> 00:53:46.673
the boss. How is your tea?
But you're the boss. You


787
00:53:46.675 --> 00:53:48.541
should be able to get it.
I am able to get it.


788
00:53:48.543 --> 00:53:52.278
Because I saw they're auditioning
all these girls. You know,


789
00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.880
I'm not asking you to give me the
part, I just wanna know, would you


790
00:53:54.882 --> 00:53:58.350
please get me this audition?
You with me or not?


791
00:53:58.352 --> 00:54:00.352
The, the company is,
is nothing like,


792
00:54:00.354 --> 00:54:06.558

793
00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:09.861
know? That darn lifestyle.

Would you have babies with me?
Alex? Alex?


795
00:54:12.532 --> 00:54:18.702
I really think he needs to get it
under control. Alex. Oh, Alex.


796
00:54:18.704 --> 00:54:24.841
You aren't really wanna have babies.
But I can't have babies right now.


797
00:54:28.546 --> 00:54:30.812
I'd really like to talk to you.
I, I'd love to do


798
00:54:30.814 --> 00:54:34.315
that, but I want to have a career
first, you know? Of course,


799
00:54:34.317 --> 00:54:39.019

would be my dream, baby,


800
00:54:39.021 --> 00:54:44.891
if I could have this career going
and once it's going we could go to

Hello. Wife. We're gonna

876
01:02:35.521 --> 01:02:37.587
in just a moment. You know,
Anna, I have to stay


877
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:42.391
longer because now I'm gonna be reading
for the director. So it's gonna


878
01:02:42.393 --> 01:02:46.728
take me a little longer, baby.
Maybe you wanna go home?


879
01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:50.298
Who's the director?
The director is


880
01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.300
Lester Moore. Oh, my God.

881
01:02:52.302 --> 01:02:54.869
He's big in Mexico.

882
01:02:55.538 --> 01:02:56.770
Alex. We're
going to meet Alex.


883
01:02:56.772 --> 01:03:01.908
Yeah, that's him. That's him. I'm
reading for him right now. Baby,


884
01:03:04.712 --> 01:03:07.379
I'm so excited. Oh, my God. I'm really
nervous. What if I fuckin' blow


885
01:03:07.381 --> 01:03:14.285
it? What if I fuckin' blow it? Tell
me that I'm good. You're good.


886
01:03:14.287 --> 01:03:21.859
Tell me that you love me.
I love you.


887
01:03:21.861 --> 01:03:27.164
- Tell me I can do it.
- You can do it.


888
01:03:34.106 --> 01:03:40.443
Over there alone. I wanna
get outta here. Let me.


889
01:04:02.967 --> 01:04:08.770
Want me to call you a cab?
I'd love to do that for you.


890
01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:18.478
Bitch. Yes,
honey, I'm the bitch.


891
01:04:20.515 --> 01:04:23.682
- Okay.
- Yeah.


892
01:04:42.669 --> 01:04:44.368
Yeah, you know, it's a little
unprofessional, but okay,


893
01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:50.974
I'll read, Now, this, this is a
scene we're gonna do. And in the...


894
01:04:50.976 --> 01:04:54.043
Valerie
Falcon, daughter of


895
01:04:54.045 --> 01:04:56.745
Vincent, the alligator skinner.
Exactly. And


896
01:04:56.747 --> 01:05:01.116
you have been Amanda, who was
her best friend. Who tragically


897
01:05:01.118 --> 01:05:03.418
died in a boating accident.
And you are.


898
01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:07.955
And you are Jason P. Wilson from
Home, Louisiana. I'm afraid so.


899
01:05:07.957 --> 01:05:09.156
He's
retiring.


900
01:05:09.158 --> 01:05:10.857
And do you know who I really am?
You're


901
01:05:10.859 --> 01:05:14.894
Valerie. Valerie Falcon, daughter
of Vincent, the alligator skinner.


902
01:05:14.896 --> 01:05:17.096
Rene, where'd we
find, His office.


903
01:05:17.098 --> 01:05:20.933
He's in his office.
Gimme a minute.


904
01:05:27.541 --> 01:05:29.440
Because the
truth will set you free.


905
01:05:29.442 --> 01:05:33.911
Oh, yes, yes, I think I'm
falling in love. Yes.


906
01:05:33.913 --> 01:05:37.547
After all your lies, how do
you even know who you are


907
01:05:37.549 --> 01:05:39.982
anymore? Well, now that
I found you, I do.


908
01:05:39.984 --> 01:05:41.717
Tell me somebody,
what's goin' on?


909
01:05:41.719 --> 01:05:45.020
Oh, Jason, I'm just

910
01:05:45.022 --> 01:05:46.688
- Oh, it's, uh...

911
01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:48.823
crayons? We're in a meeting, man.
We gotta be


912
01:05:48.825 --> 01:05:51.625
in a meeting in like

913
01:05:51.627 --> 01:05:54.027
And now that you're
here, Well, just


914
01:05:54.029 --> 01:05:56.896
get in the office. Get in the office.
You weren't


915
01:05:56.898 --> 01:05:58.764
there this morning. You weren't
at the screening for Lester, you


916
01:05:58.766 --> 01:06:03.835
know, I need you to do one thing, for us,
all of us, and just get in the meeting.


917
01:06:03.837 --> 01:06:09.974
Okay. Come on, what's the matter?
Can you do that?


918
01:06:09.976 --> 01:06:11.041
Can you
please do this?


919
01:06:11.043 --> 01:06:13.043
No, no, no, no. I'm doing for
you all the time, man. I'm


920
01:06:13.045 --> 01:06:15.178
covering your ass and doing for you.
You just do this for me. Do this


921
01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:21.918
for us. Just do it, what's the
big fucking deal? I don't care!


922
01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:26.822
You're gonna get fired. I just
want you in the meeting!


923
01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:30.324
Would you,
Hey, gimme my gun.


924
01:06:34.996 --> 01:06:36.628
I just want
you in the meeting. I


925
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:39.998
just want you in the fucking meeting.
Is that asking too much? It's the


926
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.736
one fuckin' thing I want from you.
Don't kill us. Don't destroy us all.


927
01:06:44.738 --> 01:06:50.108
Don't kill yourself either, man.
Just, just get it together. You can


928
01:06:50.110 --> 01:06:54.745
do that. You can get it together. We'll
put you in a little clinic, you can


929
01:06:54.747 --> 01:06:57.647
get all cleaned up for a little while.
You'll be good as new. But do it


930
01:06:57.649 --> 01:06:59.649
after the day, okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.


931
01:06:59.651 --> 01:07:04.053
We'll get you cleaned up. We'll
get you feeling as good as new.


932
01:07:04.822 --> 01:07:07.756
Come here. Just go
upstairs. Come on.


933
01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:14.429
Do you know who I am? You're Valerie.
Valerie Falcon,


934
01:07:14.431 --> 01:07:19.634
daughter of Vincent, the
alligator skinner. Hate me,


935
01:07:19.636 --> 01:07:21.869
Come on. After all
that's happened?


936
01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:24.171
No. Because I still see you for
the innocent girl you were


937
01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:27.941
before that tragic boating accident.
Oh, my God,


938
01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:33.780
Jason. It - It feels so good
to unburden myself.


939
01:07:33.782 --> 01:07:36.716
The truth
will set you free.


940
01:07:36.718 --> 01:07:38.517
Mmm, yes, dear. A minute

941

ago. They're
in the lobby.


942
01:07:43.356 --> 01:07:48.125
I think I'm falling in love
with you all over again.


943
01:07:56.335 --> 01:07:59.936
Me all the time, Valerie. And
after all your lies, do you


944
01:07:59.938 --> 01:08:04.106
even know who you are anymore?
Listen to


945

me. Listen to me. Now
that I found you, I don't...


946
01:08:11.915 --> 01:08:18.419
I've never stopped loving you.
Is that


947
01:08:18.421 --> 01:08:24.057
right? Oh, Jason. Oh, Jason.

pitch and, uh, we're lucky to

Speaking with
Anna earlier today, she


989
01:11:37.894 --> 01:11:43.898
said if she could make her film
here at Red Mullet, nothing would


990
01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:48.969
make her happier and I know that's
the same way that you feel.


991
01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:52.740
The feeling is collectively mutual.
Yeah.

Zee, I think, uh, Anna's prepared to

01:14:12.567 --> 01:14:17.436
<i>I'm right. The world changed forever
on that weird, crazy night.</i>


1016
01:14:17.438 --> 01:14:23.308
<i>A diggy-diggy. Trotsky in the house,
diggy-diggy. I let him in the house,</i>


1017
01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:31.215
<i>Diggy-diggy. Diggy-diggy, make
love, not war, diggy-diggy.</i>


1018
01:14:32.451 --> 01:14:34.684
<i>Peace.</i>

1019
01:14:57.742 --> 01:15:00.476
My film has
the necessity. The


1020
01:15:00.478 --> 01:15:07.216
urge to go beyond the
paradigm of collage.


1021
01:15:07.484 --> 01:15:14.188
Montage has created a fake
reality.


1022
01:15:14.690 --> 01:15:21.261
Technology has arrived. Digital
video has arrived. And is


1023
01:15:21.263 --> 01:15:26.366
demanding new expressions,
new sensations.


1024
01:15:26.368 --> 01:15:32.972
As Martin Gropius once said that
in the first Bauhaus exhibition:


1025
01:15:32.974 --> 01:15:36.442
Art, technology - a new unity.

1026
01:15:36.444 --> 01:15:41.547
We are in nineteen ninety-nine,
so it's time to say again, art,


1027
01:15:41.549 --> 01:15:47.419
technology, a new, new
unity.


1028
01:15:47.421 --> 01:15:51.356
Eisenstein and Bertrand...

1029
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.666
Being
influenced by the Russian


1030
01:16:02.668 --> 01:16:08.805
formalism, with its theory of the
strangeness, the isolation of a word


1031
01:16:08.807 --> 01:16:12.074
within a poem. Of course, we are
talking about cinema, so it would


1032
01:16:12.076 --> 01:16:18.780
be the isolation of an image. The isolation
of a take. They create it. The soul


1033
01:16:18.782 --> 01:16:25.486
can't. Soviet Montage. The
discontinuity in editing.


1034
01:16:25.488 --> 01:16:30.557
At that time, that was a vanguard.
It's not that anymore.


1035
01:16:30.559 --> 01:16:35.128
The capitalistic system that we are
living in has absorbed all the


1036
01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:37.930
innovations, all the
vanguards.


1037
01:16:38.866 --> 01:16:43.201
It's time to
move forward, to move


1038
01:16:43.203 --> 01:16:49.440
beyond. It's time to think
in terms of matter.


1039
01:16:49.442 --> 01:16:55.946
Matter to send, to
receive, to organize.


1040
01:16:56.014 --> 01:17:02.518
Everything that exists is matter.
M, matter.


1041
01:17:03.053 --> 01:17:06.587
- Oh.
- Right, right.


1042
01:17:08.591 --> 01:17:14.695
It's time to go back to Leibniz
and his modern ideology.


1043
01:17:14.897 --> 01:17:17.831
It's time to update that.

1044
01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:23.436
My film will be an unmade
film. Not just mobile.


1045
01:17:23.438 --> 01:17:28.741
A film with not one single cut,
but one continuous moment.


1046
01:17:28.743 --> 01:17:35.247
Your boyfriend freaked me out a bit.
I didn't know


1047
01:17:35.249 --> 01:17:36.781
whether,
Joey?


1048
01:17:36.783 --> 01:17:44.121
He was suggesting we all sleep together
because he was high and felt like it.


1049
01:17:44.356 --> 01:17:45.388
As I was saying,
a film with


1050
01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:51.894
not one single cut, no ending. Real time.
The music of the film will be


1051
01:17:51.896 --> 01:17:59.896
the pulsations. A film with contractions,
with dilations, rhythms, rap songs.


1052
01:17:59.937 --> 01:18:03.738
As Kant once said, repetition is drama.
Repetition is


1053
01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:11.740
rhythm. Rhythm is music.
Therefore, music is drama.


1054
01:18:13.983 --> 01:18:17.317
I remember thinking that I
really liked him, but I didn't


1055
01:18:17.319 --> 01:18:25.319
want to go to bed with your
boyfriend, Hm. Really.


1056
01:18:30.631 --> 01:18:36.267
Imagine four cameras. Imagine
four cameras displayed in


1057
01:18:36.269 --> 01:18:42.539
the city. Imagine a
situationistic type of play.


1058
01:18:42.541 --> 01:18:45.441
A Guy Debord type of play.

1059
01:18:45.443 --> 01:18:50.746
A city as a jungle. Each
of these four cameras,


1060
01:18:56.353 --> 01:18:58.419
Each of these
four cameras will


1061
01:18:58.421 --> 01:19:03.791
follow a character. And the characters
are going to meet with each other,


1062
01:19:03.793 --> 01:19:09.997
creating the plot of the story,
creating the plot of the film.


1063
01:19:09.999 --> 01:19:15.135
I was thinking that a beautiful idea
could be to use one of Borgez' plays.


1064
01:19:15.137 --> 01:19:22.408
One of Borgez's tales - The Other. A
tale where a young man meets an old man.


1065
01:19:22.410 --> 01:19:28.881
They have a conversation and then they
realize that they are the same person. It


1066
01:19:28.883 --> 01:19:33.285
will be beautiful if these four
characters are exactly the same person


1067
01:19:33.287 --> 01:19:39.157
in different stages of his or their lives.
We're thinkin' about


1068
01:19:39.159 --> 01:19:45.263
Russia. I was there with Joey filming
his Walk Don't Run tour and we


1069
01:19:45.265 --> 01:19:50.034
fell in love with the city. We fell
in love with Russian music. We


1070
01:19:50.036 --> 01:19:56.140
fell in love with Russian souls.
That's why I want to have a subject, a


1071
01:19:56.142 --> 01:20:03.247
Russian subject in this film. Also, as
you might have heard before, we are


1072
01:20:03.249 --> 01:20:09.620
approaching the music of the film in
a dialect type of a way. Having a


1073
01:20:09.622 --> 01:20:14.691
modern melody. I was
thinking Hanns Eisler


1074
01:20:14.693 --> 01:20:19.996
but with a contemporary arrangement.
The audience would do the symbols.


1075
01:20:31.942 --> 01:20:38.913
I'm sorry?
Go on.


1076
01:20:42.151 --> 01:20:48.889
- Alex. Alex.
- I'm sorry.


1077
01:20:48.891 --> 01:20:52.092
The most pretentious crap
I've ever heard.


1078
01:20:52.094 --> 01:20:55.495
- What?
- I'm sorry.


1079
01:20:55.497 --> 01:20:59.732
I'm sorry. Could you
speak louder, please?


1080
01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:06.437
Well, you think anybody around this table
has a clue about what you're talking


1081
01:21:06.439 --> 01:21:09.907
about? No. But it's
time to educate people.


1082
01:21:09.909 --> 01:21:14.111
You know, we
think this is crap, but


1083
01:21:14.113 --> 01:21:19.616
we'll do it for you and then you do
our crap and that will be the tale.


1084
01:21:19.618 --> 01:21:23.653
Alex, you're way out of line.
I brought Anna here and I


1085
01:21:23.655 --> 01:21:26.389
brought Joey here and I
respect, Look at you.


1086
01:21:26.391 --> 01:21:28.124
I expect some respect. Come on,

1087
01:21:28.126 --> 01:21:32.428
Bunny. You're way out of line.

1088
01:21:35.099 --> 01:21:39.768
I want to know what you really
think about my project.


1089
01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:40.869
- What'd you do?
- I did it.


1090
01:21:40.871 --> 01:21:43.605
I think that there's no fucking way
to say anything about your project.


1091
01:21:43.607 --> 01:21:45.139
I think I've got
this movie.


1092
01:21:45.141 --> 01:21:47.574
Since it's wrapped up in
all those phases, from all


1093
01:21:47.576 --> 01:21:51.578
those books that you've read. But
obviously, you're very intelligent


1094
01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:56.249
and, um, probably very talented.
What?


1095
01:21:56.251 --> 01:22:01.153
I earned it. But
definitely very young.


1096
01:22:06.927 --> 01:22:08.059
Thank you.

1097
01:22:08.061 --> 01:22:11.629
Thank you very much. And the,
and the director noticed me,


1098
01:22:11.631 --> 01:22:14.999
So difficult to find an
honest person in this


1099
01:22:15.001 --> 01:22:20.304
town, but I really appreciate
what you are saying to me.


1100
01:22:22.441 --> 01:22:25.809
- Right.
- Thanks.


1101
01:22:25.811 --> 01:22:31.314
I really want to work with this one.
It's...


1102
01:22:31.449 --> 01:22:34.216
as a director, very time
consuming.


1103
01:22:34.218 --> 01:22:37.752
That's why they call him the king.
Well, when


1104
01:22:37.754 --> 01:22:40.755
Alex is on there's nobody better.
Director and


1105
01:22:40.757 --> 01:22:45.326
then the director saw me and he
immediately, me. He, He knew I had it and


1106
01:22:45.328 --> 01:22:50.497
he told me that he wanted to read
something and I read for him and


1107
01:22:50.499 --> 01:22:56.469
apparently, I, apparently, I did great.
I'm not just saying this.


1108
01:22:56.471 --> 01:22:58.771
You, you don't believe me. You
don't believe me. How's it


1109
01:22:58.773 --> 01:23:03.942
feel to be married to a rich
successful man? No. No, no, no.


1110
01:23:03.944 --> 01:23:07.345
I'm going to surprise you. Baby,
you're gonna be so proud.


1111
01:23:07.347 --> 01:23:08.813
No, I believe
you.


1112
01:23:08.815 --> 01:23:10.915
Going to be so proud of me.
No, I am proud of


1113
01:23:10.917 --> 01:23:12.182
you. I think I've got it.
I mean, I have to go


1114
01:23:12.184 --> 01:23:15.018
back again and read for the
producer, but, And, and


1115
01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:17.353
- who's the producer?
- I can do this.


1116
01:23:17.355 --> 01:23:18.487
I, I don't, I
don't know.


1117
01:23:18.489 --> 01:23:20.489
You don't know who the producer is?
No. I'm just gonna


1118
01:23:20.491 --> 01:23:24.125
go back in there and,
and, and do it now again.


1119
01:23:25.328 --> 01:23:29.897
So who's Alex?

1120
01:23:31.834 --> 01:23:36.469
- Who?
- Alex.


1121
01:23:46.147 --> 01:23:50.182
Are you sure you don't know who Alex is?
No, there was,


1122
01:23:50.184 --> 01:23:53.218
there were a lot of people in
there, you know? It was there for a


1123
01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:56.955
long time. But I don't remember
any Alex, no. What about the.


1124
01:23:56.957 --> 01:24:02.193
Bitch from Louisiana?
Well, what about it?


1125
01:24:02.428 --> 01:24:07.330
Listen, bitch. I listened to
everything that you said.


1126
01:24:07.332 --> 01:24:09.398
- What?
- You have a lot of...


1127
01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.099
- Oh, my God. What?
- I had a


1128
01:24:11.101 --> 01:24:15.103
microphone. I listened
everything you said, bitch!


1129
01:24:15.105 --> 01:24:19.207
Don't you hit me. I listened
to everything you said!


1130
01:24:19.209 --> 01:24:22.443
Oh, my God! Listened to
everything you said! He's


1131
01:24:22.445 --> 01:24:27.080
just using you! He's just using you!
He's just using you!


1132
01:26:25.097 --> 01:26:28.598
Alex. Alex.

1133
01:26:33.404 --> 01:26:40.909
Um, I'm
Alex. I'm Alex.


1134
01:26:45.315 --> 01:26:49.083
I'm Lauren.

1135
01:26:53.222 --> 01:26:57.357
Um. Lauren. I need everybody
to leave the room right


1136
01:26:57.359 --> 01:27:02.195
now. She said to leave 'em.
Leave 'em.


1137
01:27:14.642 --> 01:27:19.745
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.


1138
01:27:19.747 --> 01:27:23.949
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, let's do this. Go.


1139
01:27:26.753 --> 01:27:33.257
Hey, Rose.
What's happening here?


1140
01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:45.202
Lauren. I'm sorry. I,
I, I'm truly, Lauren.


1141
01:28:30.047 --> 01:28:36.151
- Oh. Come here, Rose.
- Lauren.


1142
01:28:36.153 --> 01:28:43.258
- This is not so bad.
- I'm gonna get some...


1143
01:29:35.045 --> 01:29:39.947
Alex. Alex.
That's a lot of blood.


1144
01:29:43.052 --> 01:29:46.420
A lot of blood.

1145
01:30:40.042 --> 01:30:46.212
Don't be
afraid. Don't be afraid.


1146
01:30:50.451 --> 01:30:57.222
What has happened? I'm bleeding.

1147
01:30:57.224 --> 01:31:05.224
Can you, can you help me
out with my phone, please?


1148
01:31:12.305 --> 01:31:19.576
It's my,
Hello?


1149
01:31:19.578 --> 01:31:25.315
Hello, darling. Hello, Emma.

1150
01:31:25.317 --> 01:31:33.317
Hello. I love you. Hello.

1151
01:31:35.793 --> 01:31:42.497
Oh. I love
you, too, Emma.


1152
01:31:42.799 --> 01:31:46.634
I love you, too.

1153
01:31:49.605 --> 01:31:52.172
Can I see you tonight?

1154
01:31:52.174 --> 01:31:57.911
Um, couldn't you. Couldn't you order
a table at a nice restaurant?
