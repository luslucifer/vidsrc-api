00:00:48.658 --> 00:00:51.454
<i>Happy New Year.!</i>

2
00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.014
Sigma, Phi, Omega, hey! Sigma, Phi, Omega, hey!

3
00:00:55.126 --> 00:01:00.424
Sigma, Phi, Omega, hey! Sigma, Phi, Omega, hey!
Sigma, Phi, Omega, hey!


4
00:01:17.063 --> 00:01:19.461
Hey, there she is now.

5
00:01:19.564 --> 00:01:23.361
<i>Will you tell me
what she sees in you, please?</i>


6
00:01:24.832 --> 00:01:26.559
Can you figure
this one out, Ed?


7
00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:28.632
I mean, now,
this guy's got some luck.


8
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:31.325
Women are strange, Doctor.

9
00:01:31.432 --> 00:01:34.729
- Very strange.
- Right, Ed. Sensitive.


10
00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:38.130
<i>He's probably very sensitive.
Chicks go for the sensitive fellows, you know.</i>


11
00:01:38.234 --> 00:01:40.132
Yeah, well, I wouldn't mind
going in your place.


12
00:01:40.234 --> 00:01:42.928
<i>Yeah, you would, wouldn't you, you devil?</i>

13
00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:46.866
- You want him to fill in for ya? Huh?
- Offensive.


14
00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.299
<i>- This is true love, old man.
- TouchÃ©, Jackson.</i>


15
00:01:50.403 --> 00:01:55.132
Look, Alana's nice.
Confused, but nice.


16
00:01:55.237 --> 00:01:57.965
Hey, there she goes.

17
00:02:02.638 --> 00:02:06.469
Now, what do you say, huh? Huh?

18
00:02:06.573 --> 00:02:09.539
- You trust me? Okay.
- We're gonna take good care of you.


19
00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.538
- Come on.
- Let's go.


20
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.833
Don't worry.

21
00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:17.101
What are you laughing at?
Come on!


22
00:02:17.208 --> 00:02:20.800
- You're gonna love it.
- Give me that. You're gonna
need both your hands free.


23
00:02:20.908 --> 00:02:24.807
You're gonna be wearing that beanie
all year if you don't get laid tonight.


24
00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.603
Laid, sir? Me, sir?

25
00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:37.138
Okay. Bare tit.
See what you can do.


26
00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.444
Sorry. After you get laid.

27
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.745
Still wearing your beanie
I see, huh?


28
00:02:48.847 --> 00:02:53.304
- Well, happy New Year anyway, buddy.
- Hey, same to you, Doc.


29
00:02:56.815 --> 00:02:59.839
- Is that real?
- Is the pope Catholic?


30
00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:02.075
I don't know what you're gonna do
when we get to med school.


31
00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:06.447
<i>I'm losing my nerve.
I don't even know this guy.</i>


32
00:03:09.118 --> 00:03:11.016
- Mitchy!
- You look adorable!


33
00:03:11.118 --> 00:03:13.244
- I feel like an idiot.
- You can't chicken out now.


34
00:03:13.352 --> 00:03:17.114
- Why am I doing this?
- Because you're the best bait
we got around here, honey.


35
00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.811
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- Fun?


36
00:03:26.755 --> 00:03:29.278
Oh, my God.
Look at this place!


37
00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.355
I know.

38
00:03:32.622 --> 00:03:34.884
- Who is that?
- I don't know.


39
00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.854
Some friend of Doc's.
Anyway, you know what to do.


40
00:03:37.957 --> 00:03:40.116
- Okay?
- Yeah, but I don't like it.


41
00:03:40.224 --> 00:03:43.952
<i>- Go get her, tiger.
- Come on, Kenny. Go for it.!</i>


42
00:03:44.058 --> 00:03:45.956
<i>- Go on.!
- Mitchy.!</i>


43
00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:47.887
<i>Don't be afraid, Kenny.</i>

44
00:03:47.991 --> 00:03:49.890
<i>- Hey, what are you doing?
- Mitchy!</i>


45
00:03:49.992 --> 00:03:53.584
- Now, look, you really want her, right?
- Mm-hmm.


46
00:03:53.693 --> 00:03:56.591
Okay. Go ahead.

47
00:03:56.693 --> 00:04:00.251
We'll be down here
if you need us. All right?


48
00:04:46.403 --> 00:04:48.961
- Alana?
- Hello, Kenny.


49
00:05:09.874 --> 00:05:14.239
Don't be shy.
This is my first time too.


50
00:05:29.943 --> 00:05:31.842
Kiss me, Kenny.

51
00:05:31.944 --> 00:05:34.467
<i>Kiss me.</i>

52
00:05:37.678 --> 00:05:39.974
Kiss me.

53
00:07:57.338 --> 00:08:00.498
Yes, it's the opportunity
of a lifetime, my boy!


54
00:08:10.974 --> 00:08:12.530
- One more. Hold it.
- Now!


55
00:08:12.641 --> 00:08:13.800
- Ready?
- Yes!


56
00:08:13.908 --> 00:08:17.306
There you go.

57
00:08:17.408 --> 00:08:20.500
A train!

58
00:08:20.609 --> 00:08:23.598
Well, you wouldn't let me buy you
a graduation present, so I got you this instead.


59
00:08:23.709 --> 00:08:25.608
I love you.

60
00:08:34.312 --> 00:08:39.802
Has anyone seen my girlfriend?
She's the one with the big caboose!


61
00:08:39.913 --> 00:08:42.106
- You gonna let him get away with this?
- No way!


62
00:08:47.614 --> 00:08:50.978
Hey! Now, this is
what I call a party!


63
00:08:53.515 --> 00:08:56.038
- L-I'd like to propose a toast.
- Ridiculous!


64
00:08:56.149 --> 00:08:59.775
- That's not toast, my good man.
- Shut up!


65
00:08:59.883 --> 00:09:02.042
It's a real honor
hosting with you guys.


66
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.877
- I mean that.
- Hey, same here.


67
00:09:03.983 --> 00:09:08.178
My last big college party.
But it's gonna be the best!


68
00:09:10.285 --> 00:09:13.480
Hey! To four really great years.

69
00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:15.484
- Oh, yeah!
- Really.


70
00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:25.453
<i>Let's get the goodies. Come on.
I'll see you later on the train.</i>


71
00:09:27.888 --> 00:09:29.979
- Oh, thanks.
- Are you guys medical students?


72
00:09:30.088 --> 00:09:32.680
Well, premed.
Here's your date, Ed.


73
00:09:32.789 --> 00:09:37.654
- Listen, thank you very much.
Would you like a joint?
- Yeah, I wouldn't mind one.


74
00:09:37.757 --> 00:09:41.155
- Go ahead, help yourself.
- Oh, my God.


75
00:09:41.257 --> 00:09:44.088
- Thank you very much, boys.
You're really a lot of fun.
- Hey, Doc, give me.


76
00:09:44.192 --> 00:09:46.681
- Lot of fun.
- Come on. Let's get this thing into gear.


77
00:09:46.792 --> 00:09:49.417
All right!

78
00:09:56.561 --> 00:09:59.652
Hey, Donnelly.
Take a look at this.


79
00:09:59.761 --> 00:10:03.558
My goodness gracious!

80
00:10:03.662 --> 00:10:07.822
Happy New Year!

81
00:10:07.929 --> 00:10:10.327
Goodies for everybody!

82
00:10:14.497 --> 00:10:16.690
- Mr. Conductor!
- Yeah?


83
00:10:16.797 --> 00:10:19.389
Did you say "all aboard"?
That's ridiculous!


84
00:10:19.498 --> 00:10:23.022
They can't be bored.
I haven't even started.


85
00:10:24.132 --> 00:10:27.690
Hey, Fred, forget it.

86
00:10:27.799 --> 00:10:31.323
She's not your type.
Think of the children!


87
00:10:32.733 --> 00:10:35.029
Come on, baby.
Open your eyes.


88
00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:40.067
<i>Come on. Look at me.
Just my luck. She's a lesbian.</i>


89
00:10:40.168 --> 00:10:44.329
Wait a sec. I've got an idea.
Let's play charades, and my word will be "orgy."


90
00:10:46.236 --> 00:10:49.533
Wait, wait, wait!
I think she sprung a leak.


91
00:10:49.636 --> 00:10:52.296
Either that,
or she's hissing me.


92
00:10:54.505 --> 00:10:57.733
Excuse me. Excuse me.

93
00:11:03.372 --> 00:11:06.703
Here, let me give you
a hand with that.


94
00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.039
Thanks a lot.

95
00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:14.040
- You the slicker of this outfit?
- I try to be.


96
00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:18.534
- Extraordinaire!
- Hey, fella!


97
00:11:21.109 --> 00:11:24.303
Did you make my date disappear?

98
00:11:27.311 --> 00:11:29.937
- Come on. Let's check this train out.
- No, I've gotta find Pet...


99
00:11:30.045 --> 00:11:32.170
before I forget
what she looks like.


100
00:11:34.545 --> 00:11:37.410
<i>You may have some weather,
but the fella who came through at 6... 00...</i>


101
00:11:37.513 --> 00:11:40.673
said the track was clear.

102
00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.678
Try and see
they don't tear it apart.


103
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.941
<i>With a party like that, I'm always afraid
some kid's gonna hurt himself.</i>


104
00:11:47.048 --> 00:11:50.776
Maggie, I wish to hell
they'd put a radio on that train.


105
00:11:50.882 --> 00:11:54.337
What if one of those kids
got drunk and fell off?


106
00:11:54.449 --> 00:11:57.313
I've been talkin' on that
for two years.


107
00:11:58.816 --> 00:12:02.874
Belknap always puts
the kibosh on it.


108
00:12:02.984 --> 00:12:05.143
<i>He says, "We ain't Amtrak.</i>

109
00:12:05.251 --> 00:12:07.649
<i>We'rejust a little old
excursion train. "</i>


110
00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:09.979
He oughta be here tonight.

111
00:12:10.085 --> 00:12:12.313
<i>Be like ridin'herd
on a flea circus.</i>


112
00:12:24.021 --> 00:12:26.953
Are you sure
you won't go with us, Maggie?


113
00:12:27.055 --> 00:12:29.487
With a bunch like that?
Not on your life.


114
00:12:31.456 --> 00:12:33.922
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.


115
00:12:34.023 --> 00:12:36.682
<i>- So long.
- So long.</i>


116
00:12:38.457 --> 00:12:42.185
You folks ready
for the time of your life?


117
00:12:42.291 --> 00:12:45.655
You won't be disappointed,
I promise.


118
00:12:51.726 --> 00:12:53.919
All aboard!

119
00:13:00.761 --> 00:13:03.489
Hey, look at Ed!

120
00:13:03.596 --> 00:13:07.154
Fantastic!

121
00:13:07.263 --> 00:13:10.593
Fabulous blood! Hey, did you see Ed?
Pretty good, eh?


122
00:13:10.697 --> 00:13:13.095
Way to go, Eduardo!

123
00:14:45.047 --> 00:14:46.979
<i>I don't know. 
I think the bar car's up this way.</i>

124
00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:48.980
Anybody home?

125
00:14:49.082 --> 00:14:50.638
- Hi.
- Is this the sink?


126
00:14:50.748 --> 00:14:52.339
- Yeah.
- Looks like a bedpan.


127
00:14:52.449 --> 00:14:55.439
- I think it is.
- Congratulations, by the way.


128
00:14:55.549 --> 00:14:58.209
- Thank you.
- And lots of luck, for sure.


129
00:14:58.316 --> 00:15:00.646
- Hiya, Mitchy.
- Hi. How's it goin'?


130
00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:03.239
My roommate's graduating early too.

131
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:06.045
Maybe then Mitchy and I
can room together.


132
00:15:09.318 --> 00:15:11.217
You're gonna stick me with that?

133
00:15:11.319 --> 00:15:13.410
- What's wrong? Bunnies are cute.
- Oh, thanks.


134
00:15:16.387 --> 00:15:20.786
Hey, come on. You know I have to work
before school starts. It's gonna be real expensive.


135
00:15:20.888 --> 00:15:23.787
Shit. You'll get a scholarship.
You always do.


136
00:15:23.888 --> 00:15:26.514
<i>- Well, I don't have one yet.
- Marry Mo and you won't need one.</i>


137
00:15:26.622 --> 00:15:28.521
<i>Have you been talkin'
to him again?</i>


138
00:15:30.623 --> 00:15:33.055
- Come on. I am gonna miss you.
- Yeah?


139
00:15:33.156 --> 00:15:37.089
- Yeah.
- Aw, shoot. You're my only girlfriend.


140
00:15:37.191 --> 00:15:40.214
<i>- You know that?
- You're my best friend. You know that?</i>


141
00:15:40.324 --> 00:15:43.291
I am gonna miss you like crazy.

142
00:15:43.392 --> 00:15:45.858
Oh! Oh, no.

143
00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.357
I'm just an easy cry, that's all.

144
00:15:48.459 --> 00:15:50.653
I can't let Doc see me like this.

145
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.658
- Where's the girls' room on this boat anyway?
- Hey, you.


146
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.249
- Hmm?
- We're always gonna be friends.


147
00:15:55.361 --> 00:15:58.725
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


148
00:15:58.828 --> 00:16:00.794
Yeah.

149
00:16:17.398 --> 00:16:19.921
- Hi, Prez.
- Hey, Pet, how you doin'?


150
00:16:20.032 --> 00:16:22.123
- Have you guys seen Eddie around?
- Ed?


151
00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:25.528
- Check the car back there. It's open.
- Okay.


152
00:16:28.433 --> 00:16:30.661
- She still runnin' hot on you?
- Nope.


153
00:16:30.767 --> 00:16:32.995
Cooled down the grade.

154
00:16:33.101 --> 00:16:35.533
She's really beautiful,
that old engine.


155
00:16:35.635 --> 00:16:37.863
They don't make 'em
like that anymore.


156
00:16:37.968 --> 00:16:40.867
Thank God for little favors.

157
00:16:40.969 --> 00:16:43.764
<i>You're gonna see a train on the cover
of Time magazine one of these days...</i>


158
00:16:43.869 --> 00:16:45.961
<i>and I'm gonna be
in that cab in the picture.</i>


159
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.195
And I'll be up in the Concorde,
and you'll be on welfare.


160
00:16:49.304 --> 00:16:52.702
<i>You're diggin'your own grave
with that shovel career-wise.</i>


161
00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:55.270
What's the price of gas right now?

162
00:16:55.372 --> 00:16:58.134
Pretty soon, the only way
you'll get that beer can someplace...


163
00:16:58.239 --> 00:16:59.761
<i>is you load it on a flatcar.</i>

164
00:16:59.872 --> 00:17:01.805
Guess who'll be driving the train?

165
00:17:04.173 --> 00:17:07.606
You can cook, you can take a shower,
you can watch TV...


166
00:17:07.707 --> 00:17:10.367
and, by God,
you can hang a left if you feel like it.


167
00:17:11.742 --> 00:17:14.606
That poor, deluded boy.

168
00:17:29.045 --> 00:17:32.569
<i>It's a rotten crowd.
Listen to 'em.</i>


169
00:17:32.679 --> 00:17:35.577
Well, it beats
a six-year-old's birthday party.


170
00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:38.737
I have to have it quiet
when I do my illusions.


171
00:17:38.847 --> 00:17:40.745
You know, it pays better too.

172
00:17:40.847 --> 00:17:44.644
<i>Hey, I thought you said
you'd played frat parties before.</i>


173
00:17:44.748 --> 00:17:47.146
<i>- They're not gonna watch.
- Oh, they'll watch.</i>


174
00:17:47.248 --> 00:17:49.180
<i>Go out and do
some close-up magic.</i>


175
00:17:49.282 --> 00:17:52.579
<i>- Warm 'em up.
- I'm not ready.</i>


176
00:17:54.182 --> 00:17:58.081
Okay, here we go!
Stimulation for the nation.


177
00:17:58.183 --> 00:18:00.945
<i>Hey, host lounge for seniors only.!</i>

178
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:04.415
<i>- Get out.!
- What do you think this is? Come on. Seniors only.</i>


179
00:18:04.518 --> 00:18:07.212
We are gonna be remembered
forever for this one.


180
00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:09.547
- Happy Hog Night, children.
- Hog Night?


181
00:18:09.653 --> 00:18:13.086
Hog Night! That's right.
That's what they used to call it.


182
00:18:13.186 --> 00:18:16.584
Big bonfire, and all
the pledges had to get laid.


183
00:18:16.687 --> 00:18:19.881
It's true. They had to abolish it.
Something happened one year...


184
00:18:19.987 --> 00:18:22.954
<i>- and they had to kick a whole
bunch of guys out of school.
- Well, almost kicked out.</i>


185
00:18:23.988 --> 00:18:25.977
Christ, did we do that?

186
00:18:26.088 --> 00:18:28.316
- You're the guys?
- Oh, no, it wasn't us.


187
00:18:28.422 --> 00:18:30.321
It must've been somebody else.

188
00:18:30.423 --> 00:18:34.322
Look, it was supposed to be a simple joke,
and it sort of got out of control one year.


189
00:18:34.423 --> 00:18:36.788
<i>- Just forget about it.
- You wanna know what really happened?</i>


190
00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:38.789
- Yeah!
- Will you just drop it?


191
00:18:38.891 --> 00:18:41.255
We were freshmen.
It's Christmas vacation.


192
00:18:41.358 --> 00:18:44.290
I got a job at the medical center,
practically a janitor.


193
00:18:44.392 --> 00:18:48.120
So I go into this lab one night.
It's unlocked...


194
00:18:48.226 --> 00:18:51.284
and there's this lady there...
poor soul... who'd just fallen apart.


195
00:18:51.394 --> 00:18:53.292
<i>Yeah, literally.</i>

196
00:18:53.394 --> 00:18:57.020
Now, I promised these dorks I was gonna
come up with something truly special.


197
00:18:57.128 --> 00:19:02.494
<i>Yeah, really special.
Put a kid in the hospital.</i>


198
00:19:02.596 --> 00:19:04.619
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I ruin your punch line?</i>


199
00:19:04.729 --> 00:19:08.719
You tell them.
You were there, remember?


200
00:19:10.196 --> 00:19:12.163
Hey, Alana.

201
00:19:18.698 --> 00:19:20.892
Sucks to you.

202
00:19:20.999 --> 00:19:24.363
Hey, come on. It's New Year's!
Let's be happy!


203
00:19:24.466 --> 00:19:27.455
- Why don't you let these poor children go?
- Okay, children, run along.


204
00:19:27.567 --> 00:19:29.659
Another time. Leave the women here.
Thank you very much.


205
00:19:29.767 --> 00:19:32.893
<i>- Thanks for the booze, sir.
- Yeah, thanks.
- Booze?</i>


206
00:19:35.602 --> 00:19:38.160
Well, that was
actually nice of you.


207
00:19:38.269 --> 00:19:40.394
- Now, what are we gonna drink?
- What are we gonna drink?


208
00:19:40.503 --> 00:19:42.401
-What are we gonna drink
-What are we gonna drink


209
00:19:42.503 --> 00:19:44.402
-What are we gonna drink
- Champagne!


210
00:19:55.072 --> 00:19:56.970
Absolutely there's a future in it.

211
00:19:57.072 --> 00:19:58.971
People gotta come back to rail.

212
00:19:59.073 --> 00:20:01.800
I'll bet you read
a lot of science fiction.


213
00:20:01.906 --> 00:20:04.338
Hey, Shovels,
you know what we call him?


214
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.963
<i>Winnebago.</i>

215
00:20:06.074 --> 00:20:08.836
How is the R.V. 
Business these days?

216
00:20:08.942 --> 00:20:10.840
How the hell do you think it is?

217
00:20:10.942 --> 00:20:14.568
I wouldn't be here if
I wasn't up to my hind end in inventory.


218
00:20:14.676 --> 00:20:16.733
<i>But I'll move 'em sooner or later.</i>

219
00:20:16.842 --> 00:20:20.003
Should've got out

220
00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:25.475
<i>Now, think on this. When's the last time
somebody built a shopping mall...</i>


221
00:20:25.578 --> 00:20:27.477
<i>next to a train station?</i>

222
00:20:27.578 --> 00:20:30.340
Think about that.

223
00:20:43.348 --> 00:20:45.280
Jesus!

224
00:20:45.381 --> 00:20:47.973
Oh! It's you!

225
00:20:48.082 --> 00:20:50.173
You about scared
the pants right off me.


226
00:20:50.282 --> 00:20:52.544
You are bad, Eduardo.

227
00:20:52.649 --> 00:20:55.411
What's this?
Oh, that thing.


228
00:20:55.517 --> 00:20:59.245
Not only is that gross,
but I know who gave it to you.


229
00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:02.613
Mm-hmm. Somebody else
is looking for you-hoo.


230
00:21:05.385 --> 00:21:08.351
Mm-hmm.

231
00:21:08.452 --> 00:21:11.112
You wanna know who she is?

232
00:21:11.219 --> 00:21:15.084
Uh-huh. Well...

233
00:21:15.187 --> 00:21:17.653
a cute little thing.

234
00:21:17.754 --> 00:21:20.380
Now, tell me, what's her name?
Pet... that's it.


235
00:21:20.487 --> 00:21:22.579
Are you stoned?

236
00:21:22.689 --> 00:21:24.587
Surprise!

237
00:21:24.689 --> 00:21:26.587
<i>Get lost.!</i>

238
00:21:26.689 --> 00:21:29.315
Ow! That hurts!

239
00:21:29.423 --> 00:21:32.390
How you doin', Eduardo?

240
00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:34.581
Jesus!

241
00:21:34.691 --> 00:21:38.385
Hey, Ed, that number
at the station...


242
00:21:40.025 --> 00:21:43.458
with the sword,
better than Doc could have done.


243
00:21:43.559 --> 00:21:47.083
Super fantastic, man.

244
00:21:52.027 --> 00:21:54.255
Hey, Ed, want a drink?

245
00:22:05.396 --> 00:22:07.419
Shh!

246
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.019
I've got the good stuff, Ed.

247
00:22:13.698 --> 00:22:16.358
Hey, where do they keep
the glasses?


248
00:22:18.032 --> 00:22:21.930
<i>Ah, here they are.
Now we're talkin' Whoops.!</i>


249
00:22:22.032 --> 00:22:25.829
<i>Easy, Jackson. Here we go, Eduardo.
How's this?</i>


250
00:22:25.933 --> 00:22:29.991
Hey, hey, hey! Take it easy, man.
What are you doin'?


251
00:22:30.101 --> 00:22:34.295
Oh, my God! No! No, no!

252
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.698
<i>- Very classy.
- You like this, huh?</i>


253
00:22:45.804 --> 00:22:51.102
You know, I've always wanted
my own toy train, but this is ridiculous.


254
00:22:51.205 --> 00:22:53.966
- You know, you're very imaginative, buster.
- I have my moments.


255
00:22:54.072 --> 00:22:57.869
I know. Hey, Mitch,
I may have to marry him after all.


256
00:22:57.973 --> 00:23:00.838
Marry me.

257
00:23:02.607 --> 00:23:05.938
<i>- It was my idea.
- Aw, Doc.</i>


258
00:23:06.041 --> 00:23:09.098
I cannot tell a lie.
I'm sorry, buddy.


259
00:23:09.208 --> 00:23:11.697
<i>- It got stuck in my throat.
- I thought you said it was your idea.</i>


260
00:23:11.809 --> 00:23:13.968
<i>Look, I know I suggested
letting her think otherwise.</i>


261
00:23:14.076 --> 00:23:16.941
- That's real generous of you.
- Thank you.


262
00:23:17.043 --> 00:23:19.804
<i>- So you're the one who's paying for all this.
- Oh, no.</i>


263
00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:24.105
Mo's the one with the bread.
I've got all the ideas.


264
00:23:24.211 --> 00:23:28.144
For instance, guess what I put
in the stuff I gave those dorks?


265
00:23:28.245 --> 00:23:30.438
You asshole!

266
00:23:30.546 --> 00:23:33.138
You can't have a good time
without hurting somebody, can you?


267
00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:35.678
Is that why you told me
it was your idea?


268
00:23:35.779 --> 00:23:39.338
<i>'Cause I said I'd never go
to another one ofhis fucking parties?</i>


269
00:23:39.447 --> 00:23:41.812
Alana, you're always walking out
on my parties.


270
00:23:41.914 --> 00:23:45.642
<i>But this time, you can't.</i>

271
00:23:49.749 --> 00:23:52.648
I'll get you for this one, Doc.

272
00:23:53.984 --> 00:23:56.109
I mean it this time.

273
00:24:06.752 --> 00:24:10.685
Now, look, this was
a good idea, right?


274
00:24:10.786 --> 00:24:13.014
- Right?
- Yeah.


275
00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.019
- So what the hell does it matter...
- It matters a lot!


276
00:24:17.754 --> 00:24:19.653
I'm sorry.

277
00:24:21.055 --> 00:24:23.021
I know.

278
00:24:27.256 --> 00:24:30.051
I just can't wait for the other surprises
he's got planned.


279
00:24:30.156 --> 00:24:32.180
Whoopee cushions, exploding cigars.

280
00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.348
Oh, Jesus.

281
00:24:35.458 --> 00:24:40.482
<i>- What?
- Somebody broke a bottle in there... already.</i>


282
00:24:40.592 --> 00:24:42.922
I told you it was gonna be
another one of these stupid parties.


283
00:24:43.026 --> 00:24:45.992
Come on!
Give it a chance, will ya?


284
00:25:09.831 --> 00:25:14.093
Hey, Carne, what about those
smart alecks in the back?


285
00:25:14.198 --> 00:25:16.392
Shouldn't we take a look-see?

286
00:25:16.499 --> 00:25:20.454
Nah. I'd be a wet blanket
if I walked through there now.


287
00:25:20.566 --> 00:25:22.465
They can cool down
by themselves.


288
00:25:22.567 --> 00:25:25.397
Good evening.

289
00:25:30.501 --> 00:25:33.161
Admit it. You're impressed.

290
00:25:33.268 --> 00:25:35.166
Okay, I'm impressed.

291
00:25:35.268 --> 00:25:37.632
- Mo...
- Good evening, ladies. Welcome aboard.


292
00:25:37.736 --> 00:25:39.895
- Hello.
- How are you? So where are the guys?


293
00:25:40.003 --> 00:25:41.902
- Weren't they with you?
- No, I didn't see 'em.


294
00:25:42.004 --> 00:25:43.902
<i>Jackson was there for
a while, but he must've...</i>

295
00:25:44.004 --> 00:25:47.630
- Look, he's doing magic.
- A magician. What a great idea. Come on.


296
00:25:47.738 --> 00:25:49.637
<i>- I wanna get some peanuts.
- Thank you.</i>


297
00:25:49.738 --> 00:25:51.500
<i>- There's a ton of peanuts.
- They're not hot.</i>


298
00:25:51.605 --> 00:25:54.504
- "They're not hot."
- Excuse me?


299
00:25:54.606 --> 00:25:57.504
<i>Uh, could I borrow
that coin you have there?</i>


300
00:25:57.606 --> 00:25:59.936
Yeah.

301
00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.870
Watch this.

302
00:26:01.974 --> 00:26:05.168
If I take your cigarette
and hold it up to your quarter...


303
00:26:05.274 --> 00:26:09.037
it'll seem to be sticking to it...

304
00:26:09.142 --> 00:26:11.199
just like that.

305
00:26:11.309 --> 00:26:14.242
<i>And if we keep
turning it, it'll look like...</i>

306
00:26:14.342 --> 00:26:17.832
The cigarette's penetrating the quarter,
just like that.


307
00:26:17.944 --> 00:26:20.808
Could you, um,
take this lighter here...


308
00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:22.877
<i>- and, uh, light it up?
- It'll give you cancer.</i>


309
00:26:22.977 --> 00:26:24.876
It's for effect. It's okay.

310
00:26:24.978 --> 00:26:28.342
Okay.

311
00:26:28.445 --> 00:26:30.638
You may have relatives in ze old country.

312
00:26:30.746 --> 00:26:32.645
This is the best part of all.

313
00:26:32.747 --> 00:26:34.906
If we take the cigarette
and start to remove it...


314
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:41.039
the quarter will seem
to, um, seal itself up.


315
00:26:41.148 --> 00:26:43.376
- Whoo!
- That's great!


316
00:26:43.482 --> 00:26:45.914
That's great. That's fantastic.

317
00:26:46.016 --> 00:26:48.312
Thank you.
Have you ever seen a quarter...


318
00:26:48.416 --> 00:26:50.939
that, um, allows a cigarette
to go through it?


319
00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:54.244
- No.
- Well, there's no such thing.


320
00:26:57.517 --> 00:27:01.848
- Now what about my peanuts?
- I've got that taken care of.


321
00:27:01.952 --> 00:27:03.975
Come over here.

322
00:27:15.021 --> 00:27:19.079
<i>Smart aleck.!</i>

323
00:27:25.289 --> 00:27:28.847
<i>Uh, pick a card. Any card. 
It don't matter.</i>

324
00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:33.723
Come on. L-I gotta go.
Show's about to start.


325
00:27:33.824 --> 00:27:37.848
- Uh-huh. You gonna be part of it, Carne?
- Ain't you gonna pick one?


326
00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:43.248
Free Will Baptist.
We never touch 'em.


327
00:27:43.359 --> 00:27:46.689
I use 'em all
the time in my work.

328
00:27:46.793 --> 00:27:49.055
<i>Helps break the ice
for my customers.</i>


329
00:27:53.061 --> 00:27:56.324
<i>This always happens to me. Always.</i>

330
00:27:56.428 --> 00:28:00.486
Aw, come on, Pet. You're always
looking for that kind of guy, right?


331
00:28:00.596 --> 00:28:03.358
I mean, what you have to say is,
"Fuck 'em."


332
00:28:03.463 --> 00:28:07.589
Listen, ifJackson shows up,
tell him I went home.


333
00:28:09.331 --> 00:28:14.321
Me too. Ed was on the platform.
I bet the shit missed the train.


334
00:28:18.866 --> 00:28:20.890
Hey, remember me?

335
00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.758
Alana, come on.

336
00:28:27.868 --> 00:28:30.630
I said I was
sorry, and I meant it.

337
00:28:30.735 --> 00:28:34.065
- It was stupid to let you think it was my...
- It's not that.


338
00:28:34.169 --> 00:28:38.864
Well, would you mind
telling me why you're so upset?


339
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:42.698
You let him set you up again.
Mo, you're worth 10 of him.


340
00:28:42.804 --> 00:28:45.168
Just because you belong to
the same stupid fraternity...


341
00:28:45.271 --> 00:28:48.362
Hey, hey, I happen to like
this fraternity, okay?


342
00:28:48.471 --> 00:28:50.438
You don't get it. You have no idea
what I'm trying to tell you.


343
00:28:50.538 --> 00:28:53.027
Oh, yes, I do.

344
00:28:53.139 --> 00:28:55.867
I understand, Alana.

345
00:28:55.973 --> 00:29:00.565
You have just never forgiven him for setting
you up with Kenny in the frat house.


346
00:29:00.674 --> 00:29:03.232
You've always gotta be
Little Miss Perfect.


347
00:29:03.341 --> 00:29:06.466
Look, I'm not gonna sit here and listen
to you cover for him all night, all right?


348
00:29:06.574 --> 00:29:08.632
<i>Alana, please.!</i>

349
00:29:08.742 --> 00:29:10.731
I know Doc
can be a jerk sometimes.


350
00:29:10.842 --> 00:29:12.740
<i>I'm not stupid.</i>

351
00:29:12.842 --> 00:29:15.570
<i>- Doc's my friend.
- You don't need an enemy, then.</i>


352
00:29:15.677 --> 00:29:19.610
Very funny. Did you think
of that one all by yourself?


353
00:29:22.844 --> 00:29:25.276
Excuse me.

354
00:29:29.046 --> 00:29:31.036
<i>You pulled what?</i>

355
00:29:31.146 --> 00:29:34.113
I didn't know
there was a muscle there.


356
00:29:34.213 --> 00:29:36.441
- Oh, excuse me, sir.
- Okay.


357
00:29:38.881 --> 00:29:41.279
<i>- Uh, just a minute there.
- Yeah?</i>


358
00:29:41.381 --> 00:29:43.438
- Got a little trick I'd like to show you.
- Oh, great.


359
00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:46.344
- Okay.
- Now, think on a card.


360
00:29:46.449 --> 00:29:49.075
- Oh, now, don't tell me.
- You got it?


361
00:29:49.183 --> 00:29:52.547
You got to concentrate
on the deck...


362
00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:57.549
because it's the power of the thought
that makes it rise to the top.


363
00:29:57.651 --> 00:30:00.447
<i>Let me show you
how to do that.</i>


364
00:30:00.552 --> 00:30:02.848
Five.

365
00:30:04.019 --> 00:30:05.417
Four.

366
00:30:08.153 --> 00:30:11.018
Three. There it is.

367
00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.018
Now, what...
what was your card?


368
00:30:15.754 --> 00:30:20.188
- Jack of hearts.
- Not only has it risen to the top of the deck...


369
00:30:20.288 --> 00:30:23.551
but now, it has become
the jack of spades.


370
00:30:23.656 --> 00:30:26.088
Nice one, sir.

371
00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:31.050
Just a gag.
Kind of clever, wasn't it?


372
00:30:32.458 --> 00:30:35.686
I'm gonna wet my pants
if I don't stop laughing.


373
00:30:35.792 --> 00:30:38.657
- Emergency!
- Emergency room, right here.


374
00:30:38.758 --> 00:30:40.452
- Locked.
- Oh!


375
00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:42.457
- There's another one down
at the end of the car here.
- Thanks.


376
00:30:42.559 --> 00:30:45.390
- We'll just, uh, sit this one out.
- I can't wait.


377
00:30:45.493 --> 00:30:48.119
Now, you tell the good doctor
just what's troubling you.


378
00:30:48.227 --> 00:30:50.193
Come here.

379
00:32:03.808 --> 00:32:05.707
My, that was pretty.

380
00:32:07.642 --> 00:32:10.768
<i>- Very well done.
- You know how he does it?</i>


381
00:32:12.843 --> 00:32:15.275
- Yeah.
- How?


382
00:32:17.644 --> 00:32:19.940
We're sworn to secrecy.

383
00:33:11.821 --> 00:33:13.549
<i>Hey.!</i>

384
00:33:13.654 --> 00:33:16.644
- Where is everybody?
- Watching the magician.


385
00:33:16.755 --> 00:33:19.119
- Where the hell areJackson and Ed?
- I don't know.


386
00:33:19.222 --> 00:33:22.416
Hey, wait a minute.
We didn't hire a magician.


387
00:33:22.522 --> 00:33:25.148
Well, maybe somebody else
had a good idea for a change, hmm?


388
00:33:25.256 --> 00:33:27.745
I wanna see what he does.

389
00:33:27.857 --> 00:33:29.982
Isn't she adorable?

390
00:33:34.725 --> 00:33:36.624
She still mad?

391
00:33:38.159 --> 00:33:40.421
Yeah, she's still mad.

392
00:33:41.493 --> 00:33:43.959
She'll get over it.

393
00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.583
You know, Doc...

394
00:33:46.694 --> 00:33:48.592
I'm not so sure this time.

395
00:33:50.561 --> 00:33:53.551
Well, if she dumps you,
you've always got me, you know.


396
00:33:55.662 --> 00:33:57.958
I mean it.

397
00:34:51.072 --> 00:34:52.436
Whoo!

398
00:35:00.274 --> 00:35:02.103
Let's get out of here.

399
00:35:03.341 --> 00:35:05.240
Excuse me.

400
00:35:05.342 --> 00:35:07.399
Watch your toes, Mitchy.

401
00:35:07.509 --> 00:35:10.669
Uh, what's with the snit sisters?

402
00:35:10.776 --> 00:35:13.265
Wait a minute.
Excuse me.


403
00:35:13.376 --> 00:35:16.138
One of my girlfriends thinks her boyfriend
was left back at the platform...


404
00:35:16.244 --> 00:35:19.733
<i>- before we left.
- Oh, I don't think so, not if he came with you all.</i>


405
00:35:19.845 --> 00:35:22.243
<i>The platform was clear.</i>

406
00:35:22.345 --> 00:35:24.334
You know...

407
00:35:26.012 --> 00:35:30.138
<i>they might've... they might've
switched disguises.</i>


408
00:35:30.246 --> 00:35:32.644
- You know, it'd be hard to tell.
- You talking about Ed?


409
00:35:32.747 --> 00:35:34.680
- Yeah.
- He's here. I saw him.


410
00:35:34.781 --> 00:35:37.247
<i>- He's in the Groucho costume.
- He's here?</i>


411
00:35:37.348 --> 00:35:39.109
Yeah.

412
00:35:39.215 --> 00:35:41.114
- I'm sorry. False alarm.
- It's all right.


413
00:35:41.248 --> 00:35:43.408
Hey, guys.

414
00:35:43.516 --> 00:35:46.914
You should've seen that magician.
He was fantastic.


415
00:35:47.016 --> 00:35:49.346
Poof! Just like that,
the woman was gone.


416
00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:51.939
Think he knows
how to make one come?


417
00:35:52.051 --> 00:35:55.142
- I hate magic. It's just tricks.
- Come on. You love tricks.


418
00:35:55.251 --> 00:35:59.014
- I love jokes.
- You're just pissed off'cause you can't figure it out.


419
00:36:02.486 --> 00:36:04.918
These girls look faint.

420
00:36:05.019 --> 00:36:06.918
Can we do anything
to revive them?


421
00:36:07.019 --> 00:36:09.747
I don't know.
Maybe some kind of injection?


422
00:36:09.854 --> 00:36:13.117
You girls better come back
to the consulting room with us.


423
00:36:13.221 --> 00:36:15.687
<i>We may have
to do an exploratory.</i>


424
00:36:15.788 --> 00:36:19.448
<i>- Yeah, you sure you guys have had any experience?
- Experience? Us?</i>


425
00:36:19.555 --> 00:36:22.021
Oh, come on. Tell 'em, Doc.
We got experience.


426
00:36:22.123 --> 00:36:25.521
Mo and I worked in an emergency
gynecological ward last summer.


427
00:36:25.623 --> 00:36:27.852
- Really?
- Yeah, that's right. Doc won an award.


428
00:36:27.957 --> 00:36:30.083
Best Pap smear in a supporting role.
Come on.


429
00:36:46.194 --> 00:36:48.183
Let's go get some champagne.

430
00:36:48.294 --> 00:36:50.692
Uh, I wanna stay here, okay?

431
00:36:50.795 --> 00:36:53.421
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Thank you.


432
00:36:53.529 --> 00:36:56.495
- Let's dance.
- What about the men?


433
00:36:56.596 --> 00:37:00.359
The men can obviously
take care of themselves.


434
00:37:23.434 --> 00:37:26.094
- I feel sick.
- This little lady cannot hold her liquor.


435
00:37:26.201 --> 00:37:28.326
But there's something else
I can hold.


436
00:37:28.435 --> 00:37:30.334
<i>Anyway, when in doubt, cut it out, right?</i>

437
00:37:30.436 --> 00:37:32.561
Or cut it off.
Hey, hey, come on.


438
00:37:32.669 --> 00:37:34.567
- Not in there.
- Not again!


439
00:37:34.669 --> 00:37:38.124
Anyway, we look in the jar,
and there's the tattoo around the nipple.


440
00:37:38.237 --> 00:37:41.432
- Oh, stop!
- Uh-oh. This one looks serious, Doc.


441
00:37:41.538 --> 00:37:46.096
I agree. Get her in here.
Aw, shit, it's still locked.


442
00:37:46.205 --> 00:37:49.296
- Uh-oh. Look who's here.
- Oh, hi. Hi.


443
00:37:49.405 --> 00:37:51.769
<i>Medical problem.
You think it's serious?</i>


444
00:37:51.873 --> 00:37:55.034
Smells like an alcohol problem to me.

445
00:37:55.141 --> 00:37:57.403
We know you can handle it, Captain.

446
00:37:57.508 --> 00:38:00.133
Come on.
Get out of here.


447
00:38:03.275 --> 00:38:05.241
Anybody in there?

448
00:38:07.642 --> 00:38:11.439
Speak up if you're in there.
Otherwise, I'm gonna use the passkey.


449
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:15.069
All right, I'm coming in.

450
00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.871
My God.

451
00:39:16.855 --> 00:39:19.378
If you wanna talk,
we can go back to my compartment.


452
00:39:19.489 --> 00:39:21.751
- It's quiet there.
- Probably very private too...


453
00:39:21.856 --> 00:39:24.687
with red lights and satin sheets.

454
00:39:24.791 --> 00:39:27.848
- Mood music.
- Yeah, I had the pledges install a hot tub.


455
00:39:27.957 --> 00:39:29.980
- It's very nice.
- Mmm!


456
00:39:30.091 --> 00:39:33.990
Seriously. If you wanna talk,
I'm around, okay?


457
00:39:34.092 --> 00:39:37.718
- You really have a hot tub?
- Oh, geez.


458
00:40:05.798 --> 00:40:07.765
You all right?

459
00:40:10.865 --> 00:40:12.990
You got somethin' to put in this?

460
00:40:13.099 --> 00:40:15.066
Are you sick?

461
00:40:18.233 --> 00:40:23.360
There's a boy dead back there.
He's in the sleeper toilet.


462
00:40:23.468 --> 00:40:26.264
He must have...
I don't know what happened.


463
00:40:26.369 --> 00:40:28.301
L
-I just don't know.

464
00:40:28.402 --> 00:40:30.300
No doubt in your mind?

465
00:40:30.402 --> 00:40:32.596
Oh, he's dead, all right.

466
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:36.500
I never saw anybody
so dead as that.


467
00:40:36.603 --> 00:40:39.331
I gotta sit down, Charlie,
for a minute.


468
00:40:43.372 --> 00:40:46.532
Will you watch that car
while I call Walter?


469
00:40:46.639 --> 00:40:48.605
Of course.

470
00:40:50.406 --> 00:40:54.533
Uh, nobody knows, so...

471
00:40:54.641 --> 00:40:57.903
- don't say nothin'.
- Sure.


472
00:41:00.141 --> 00:41:01.971
Hi, guys.

473
00:41:02.075 --> 00:41:04.439
Oh, where have you been
all my life?


474
00:41:04.543 --> 00:41:06.907
Just this once.

475
00:41:20.245 --> 00:41:23.837
Well, I can say
we crossed the line.


476
00:41:23.946 --> 00:41:26.037
Oh, we can back into town,
sure we can.


477
00:41:26.146 --> 00:41:28.635
But that'll green
that switch and that freight...


478
00:41:28.747 --> 00:41:32.145
and we'll be backing up a hell of
a lot slower than he'll be coming towards us.


479
00:41:32.247 --> 00:41:34.873
I guess the closest way out
is straight ahead.


480
00:41:34.981 --> 00:41:37.413
Is all hell breaking loose
back there or what?


481
00:41:37.515 --> 00:41:40.175
Just an accident.

482
00:41:40.282 --> 00:41:42.442
Let's put on a little speed.

483
00:42:18.756 --> 00:42:20.746
<i>Can you believe that guy?</i>

484
00:42:20.856 --> 00:42:24.153
Yeah, but do you know
what he asked me to do? Oh, hi.


485
00:42:24.257 --> 00:42:26.621
<i>- Could I get in there?
- I'm sorry. It's out of order.</i>


486
00:42:26.724 --> 00:42:29.656
- Would you try the other side, please?
Thank you very much.
- Okay.


487
00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:46.085
- Did you look?
- No, sir.


488
00:42:46.195 --> 00:42:49.650
Sorry to put this on you, Charlie.

489
00:42:56.629 --> 00:42:58.323
<i>What?</i>

490
00:43:02.364 --> 00:43:07.195
What the hell?
There was blood there before.


491
00:43:07.299 --> 00:43:09.231
<i>I could've sworn it.</i>

492
00:43:09.332 --> 00:43:11.696
Something's happened.

493
00:43:11.799 --> 00:43:15.732
<i>Some kind of practical joke.</i>

494
00:43:25.268 --> 00:43:27.325
Dead drunk. That's what he is.

495
00:43:27.435 --> 00:43:30.527
<i>Whoops-a-daisy.!</i>

496
00:43:30.636 --> 00:43:32.864
<i>Damn kids.</i>

497
00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:35.493
All right, up.
Come on. Up we go.


498
00:43:35.604 --> 00:43:39.037
Whoops!
Bad choo-choo.


499
00:43:43.172 --> 00:43:45.797
Oh, wow. D
-Jack!

500
00:43:45.905 --> 00:43:48.736
Do you know how gross that looks
when you're stoned?


501
00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.738
Were you in here all this time?

502
00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.035
<i>Were you sick?
He gets, you know, sick.</i>


503
00:43:54.141 --> 00:43:56.834
I guess so.

504
00:43:56.941 --> 00:44:00.567
Well, look, folks,
he's a-walkin' and a-talkin'.


505
00:44:00.675 --> 00:44:04.074
Weighs a ton.
At least that's what his girlfriend says.


506
00:44:04.175 --> 00:44:07.301
I mean, you know what I mean.

507
00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:09.399
Oh, he'll be all right.
I'll take care of him.


508
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:12.705
<i>Easy does it, right, Jack?</i>

509
00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:15.175
<i>That's a boy.</i>

510
00:44:15.277 --> 00:44:17.540
Damn medical students.

511
00:44:19.312 --> 00:44:22.336
- Oh, no. No, no.
- So, are you breaking up with Alana?


512
00:44:22.446 --> 00:44:26.072
- Only for the weekend.
- But I thought you two were getting married.


513
00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.476
- We are.
- Hey. Whoa.


514
00:44:28.581 --> 00:44:31.445
- Hey, guys, a little booze. A little booze.
- Thank you.


515
00:44:31.547 --> 00:44:33.605
A toast to us.

516
00:44:33.714 --> 00:44:35.772
- Hey, there's Jackson.
- The old yearbook.


517
00:44:35.882 --> 00:44:37.745
<i>- Let me see.
- Hey, look at Mo.</i>


518
00:44:37.849 --> 00:44:39.748
- I look like an idiot.
- Well, you still do.


519
00:44:39.849 --> 00:44:42.281
- Thanks a lot, old buddy.
- That's the Prez.


520
00:44:42.382 --> 00:44:44.508
Who's that?

521
00:44:44.617 --> 00:44:46.515
<i>That's just Kenny Hampson.</i>

522
00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:49.379
He couldn't handle it.

523
00:44:49.484 --> 00:44:53.178
Say, sweetheart,
let's take a walk.


524
00:44:53.285 --> 00:44:57.217
Hey, Doc, where are you goin'?
Doc, don't leave me alone...


525
00:44:57.319 --> 00:44:59.842
Hi. Hey, Ed,
is that you down there?


526
00:45:01.553 --> 00:45:03.110
Boo!

527
00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:06.119
D
-Jack, you can make it.

528
00:45:06.221 --> 00:45:10.881
Up! I mean, if you've never tried
an upper berth before...


529
00:45:10.988 --> 00:45:12.852
Scoot!

530
00:45:18.356 --> 00:45:20.618
You old faker.

531
00:45:20.723 --> 00:45:23.121
Jackson's with another girl.
I know it.


532
00:45:23.224 --> 00:45:25.952
You and Mitchy, you know,
you have an understanding.


533
00:45:26.058 --> 00:45:28.581
But this is a first for us.

534
00:45:30.525 --> 00:45:33.048
Could be a first for us too.

535
00:45:36.459 --> 00:45:38.426
Right?

536
00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:42.049
Like, uh...

537
00:45:42.161 --> 00:45:44.252
you and I have never
really gotten to know each other...


538
00:45:44.361 --> 00:45:48.657
and, uh, could be
our last chance.


539
00:45:51.395 --> 00:45:53.294
Right, D
-Jack?

540
00:46:06.198 --> 00:46:08.256
Think, uh, you could manage
without the flipper?


541
00:46:21.201 --> 00:46:23.724
Ooh.

542
00:46:23.835 --> 00:46:27.233
Well, uh, you know what they say:

543
00:46:27.336 --> 00:46:29.962
Cold hands, warm heart.

544
00:46:48.406 --> 00:46:50.531
<i>I don't wanna get involved
in any controversy...</i>


545
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.539
<i>on the situation
in the Middle East...</i>


546
00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.505
but as senior senator from my state,
I think I can speak for my constituents...


547
00:46:56.608 --> 00:47:00.735
indeed all Americans,
when I say, "Fuck 'em!"


548
00:47:00.842 --> 00:47:02.740
You know, there are certain phrases
in American history...


549
00:47:02.842 --> 00:47:06.366
<i>that have caught the fancy
of the American people.</i>


550
00:47:06.476 --> 00:47:10.876
The phrase that's always caught my fancy
or aroused me as it were is...


551
00:47:10.978 --> 00:47:13.808
"Let's bomb them suckers
into the Stone Age."


552
00:47:13.911 --> 00:47:16.036
<i>You know,
it wouldn't be like Vietnam.</i>


553
00:47:16.144 --> 00:47:19.941
They don't have no jungle to hide under.
Just sand and rock.


554
00:47:20.045 --> 00:47:22.409
To my way of thinkin',
if the United States Cavalry...


555
00:47:22.512 --> 00:47:25.808
<i>can take care of Paiutes
and Comanches...</i>


556
00:47:25.913 --> 00:47:29.244
a B-52 ought to do just fine
with those camel jockeys.


557
00:47:29.348 --> 00:47:32.610
- Of course, this is strictly
off the record, you understand.
- Yeah, sure.


558
00:47:32.715 --> 00:47:35.681
Of course, you're all aware
of my campaign platform...


559
00:47:35.781 --> 00:47:39.771
<i>which is a return to the gold standard,
euthanasia for all welfare recipients...</i>


560
00:47:39.883 --> 00:47:44.475
<i>and six NFL franchises,
each with its own stadium,
for the state of Louisiana.</i>


561
00:47:44.583 --> 00:47:49.278
<i>And our campaign slogan...
Let them eat brownies. What's that, ma'am?</i>


562
00:47:54.352 --> 00:47:57.046
- I liked your show.
- I remember you.


563
00:47:58.553 --> 00:48:01.610
Do you believe in magic?

564
00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:04.778
I'll have to convince you.

565
00:48:18.789 --> 00:48:22.120
- Do you do this for all your fans?
- This is my first time, Alana.


566
00:48:25.291 --> 00:48:28.122
<i>After the next show.</i>

567
00:48:28.225 --> 00:48:30.952
<i>Alana?</i>

568
00:48:35.326 --> 00:48:37.383
Mo's waiting for you.

569
00:48:37.493 --> 00:48:40.255
He said to tell you
he's sorry, and so am I.


570
00:48:42.661 --> 00:48:46.094
- You seen Mitchy?
- I thought she was with you.


571
00:48:46.195 --> 00:48:48.252
I must have missed her.

572
00:48:48.362 --> 00:48:51.454
Anyway, go talk to the guy.

573
00:48:51.563 --> 00:48:53.529
He doesn't wanna argue.

574
00:48:54.563 --> 00:48:56.530
Thanks.

575
00:49:00.597 --> 00:49:03.723
<i>- Mo?
- What?</i>


576
00:49:03.832 --> 00:49:06.162
<i>Here, Mo.</i>

577
00:49:06.266 --> 00:49:09.960
Thank you. Do you know
they drink out of these things?


578
00:49:10.066 --> 00:49:13.123
- Why don't you come join me, Mo?
- No, I'll stay here.


579
00:49:13.233 --> 00:49:16.666
- Come on. Does that mean I have to come to you?
- Mm-hmm.


580
00:49:16.767 --> 00:49:18.666
<i>- Hey, you wanna dance?
- No, I'll just watch.</i>


581
00:49:18.768 --> 00:49:20.825
- Come on.
- No, no, that's okay.


582
00:49:20.935 --> 00:49:23.424
You wanna watch, eh?
What do you wanna see?


583
00:49:24.903 --> 00:49:28.301
- Oh, let's dance.
- No, I don't wanna dance.


584
00:49:28.403 --> 00:49:30.596
<i>- Come on.
- No, that's okay.</i>


585
00:49:30.703 --> 00:49:34.568
- Does that mean you wanna do something else?
- No, no, no! I'll dance.


586
00:49:34.671 --> 00:49:37.297
- Oh, you're so cute.
- Hey, hey, no. Come on. Stop it.


587
00:49:37.404 --> 00:49:40.735
- Will you let go of my pants?
- Uh-oh.


588
00:49:40.839 --> 00:49:43.805
You're...

589
00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:53.372
What happened to that blood?

590
00:49:59.242 --> 00:50:02.106
And how the hell
did he bust that mirror?


591
00:50:05.243 --> 00:50:07.141
With a hammer?

592
00:50:07.243 --> 00:50:10.301
<i>Shuffled. Laid on the floor. There.</i>

593
00:50:10.411 --> 00:50:15.571
Not only will I find the card that was selected
and signed by our skeptical friend here...


594
00:50:15.678 --> 00:50:19.167
but, uh, I'm gonna do it...

595
00:50:19.279 --> 00:50:20.939
without looking.

596
00:50:21.046 --> 00:50:25.741
- That's third-grade stuff.
- Really?


597
00:50:28.047 --> 00:50:31.242
<i>Oh, he's getting violent. 
That's pretty sharp.</i>

598
00:50:32.282 --> 00:50:34.180
<i>What's he got?</i>

599
00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:36.053
<i>My God.</i>

600
00:52:34.104 --> 00:52:37.093
Are you okay?

601
00:52:37.204 --> 00:52:39.466
Do you know whose this is?

602
00:52:39.571 --> 00:52:43.197
Yeah, it's Mitchy's. Michelle,
my girlfriend. I'll take it. Thank you.


603
00:52:44.706 --> 00:52:46.673
Don't.

604
00:52:54.408 --> 00:52:57.273
- What's going on?
- Will you go with me, please?


605
00:52:57.375 --> 00:53:00.933
- Where'd you find this?
- Let's go, miss, please.


606
00:53:02.076 --> 00:53:04.042
Come on.

607
00:53:05.576 --> 00:53:08.543
I'm not letting you out.

608
00:53:08.644 --> 00:53:11.042
- Will you at least put your clothes on, please?
- No.


609
00:53:11.145 --> 00:53:13.338
- But we're missing the magic show.
- Boring.


610
00:53:13.445 --> 00:53:16.934
- No, no, not boring. Fun. Fun, fun, fun.
- Boring.


611
00:53:17.046 --> 00:53:19.706
<i>- Mitchy? Mo?
- Oh, my God. It's Alana.</i>


612
00:53:19.813 --> 00:53:22.643
I know he's in there.
Doc told me so.


613
00:53:22.746 --> 00:53:24.770
<i>- Doc?
- Mitchy?</i>


614
00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:27.938
<i>- That fuckin' bastard!
- I have an office.</i>


615
00:53:28.048 --> 00:53:32.481
- It's in the car up ahead. Now come on. Come on.
- Mo?


616
00:53:32.581 --> 00:53:36.105
Sit down and stay put.

617
00:53:42.583 --> 00:53:45.141
Mitchy? Mitchy?

618
00:53:45.251 --> 00:53:49.344
- Miss, sit down.
- Now just wait a minute.
Has something happened to her?


619
00:53:49.451 --> 00:53:53.441
- She didn't fall off the train, did she?
- No, ma'am.


620
00:53:53.552 --> 00:53:56.644
Now listen to me, honey.

621
00:53:56.753 --> 00:53:58.719
She's dead.

622
00:54:04.587 --> 00:54:07.985
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you!


623
00:54:08.088 --> 00:54:10.350
Hey, anyone can do that!

624
00:54:10.455 --> 00:54:13.786
Well, rather than argue with you...

625
00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:16.049
<i>I'm going to prove
that you're right.</i>


626
00:54:16.157 --> 00:54:19.317
- Have you seen Alana?
- No.


627
00:54:19.424 --> 00:54:22.357
Bullshit, you haven't!
I wanna talk to you.


628
00:54:22.458 --> 00:54:24.481
Hey, relax. Watch the show.

629
00:54:31.426 --> 00:54:35.052
I didn't get caught, okay?

630
00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:37.854
You made a mistake.

631
00:54:37.961 --> 00:54:39.927
It can't be Mitchy.

632
00:54:41.294 --> 00:54:45.352
- She's my goddamned best friend.
- Please, please.


633
00:54:49.096 --> 00:54:51.619
Oh, God. Mitchy!

634
00:54:55.264 --> 00:54:57.230
Oh, no.

635
00:55:01.966 --> 00:55:04.159
<i>We're gonna try a little mental telepathy.</i>

636
00:55:04.266 --> 00:55:08.198
First, you're gonna cover me with a cloth
so I can't see you.


637
00:55:08.299 --> 00:55:10.131
Then hold up as many fingers
as you want behind my head.


638
00:55:10.166 --> 00:55:11.962
Then hold up as many fingers
as you want behind my head.


639
00:55:12.067 --> 00:55:14.125
<i>- Hey, you seen Mitchy?
- On my command, pull away the cloth...</i>


640
00:55:14.234 --> 00:55:18.132
<i>- and I'll be holding up
the exact same number of fingers.
- She's around somewhere.</i>


641
00:55:18.234 --> 00:55:21.167
<i>Okay, cover me up.</i>

642
00:55:21.269 --> 00:55:25.066
<i>Hey, why don't you stay under there.!</i>

643
00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:30.869
<i>Can anybody make him disappear?</i>

644
00:55:30.971 --> 00:55:32.834
<i>Shall we begin?</i>

645
00:55:35.138 --> 00:55:39.798
<i>Good. Now hold your fingers up.</i>

646
00:55:39.906 --> 00:55:42.429
<i>Are you sure
that's the number you want?</i>


647
00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:45.631
<i>Then take hold
of the cloth. Ready?</i>


648
00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:49.833
<i>- Wake me when it's over.!
- One, two, three.</i>


649
00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:51.964
<i>Go.</i>

650
00:55:58.675 --> 00:56:00.574
Seven.

651
00:56:12.678 --> 00:56:14.701
Who did that to her?

652
00:56:15.812 --> 00:56:19.405
Probably some kid
messed up on dope.


653
00:56:19.512 --> 00:56:21.570
Alcohol.

654
00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:25.408
I know these people.
They wouldn't do that.


655
00:56:25.514 --> 00:56:27.946
No, of course not.

656
00:56:28.048 --> 00:56:31.208
Probably some nut
just climbed on the train.


657
00:56:31.315 --> 00:56:35.714
<i>I saw her half an hour ago
with a fella...</i>


658
00:56:35.816 --> 00:56:37.715
fallin' down...

659
00:56:38.917 --> 00:56:40.883
drunk.

660
00:56:42.351 --> 00:56:44.579
SweetJesus.

661
00:56:44.684 --> 00:56:47.674
At the end of
my last show, I, uh...

662
00:56:47.784 --> 00:56:51.013
<i>dematerialized my assistant.</i>

663
00:56:52.986 --> 00:56:56.441
Well, for my next show,
I'm gonna need to have her back.


664
00:56:56.553 --> 00:56:58.520
So, watch.

665
00:57:17.423 --> 00:57:19.753
<i>- Wake up, buddy. It's over.
- Thank you.</i>


666
00:57:19.857 --> 00:57:21.915
<i>- Hey.
- Thank you.</i>


667
00:57:22.025 --> 00:57:24.150
Oh, that's a good one.
That's a good one.


668
00:57:24.258 --> 00:57:26.315
You're great. Thank you.

669
00:57:26.425 --> 00:57:29.653
Get up. Come on, Mo.
Come on.


670
00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:34.517
What are you doing?
What are you doing?


671
00:57:34.626 --> 00:57:36.820
Mo?

672
00:57:36.927 --> 00:57:39.053
<i>Mo?</i>

673
00:57:39.161 --> 00:57:41.787
Mo?

674
00:57:41.894 --> 00:57:45.419
Mo, get up.
Mo, wake up. Help!


675
00:57:47.463 --> 00:57:49.656
Wake up. Help!

676
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:53.828
Help me, please!

677
00:57:57.031 --> 00:57:58.827
Get up!

678
00:58:02.466 --> 00:58:05.694
<i>- Help! Please!
- Nice gag, Doc.</i>


679
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.159
<i>Help me.</i>

680
00:58:10.266 --> 00:58:12.199
<i>Please!</i>

681
00:58:15.668 --> 00:58:19.362
Somebody, help me!
He's bleeding, you bastards!


682
00:58:19.469 --> 00:58:21.163
<i>Help.!</i>

683
00:58:21.268 --> 00:58:23.734
- Doc?
- Help him.


684
00:58:23.836 --> 00:58:28.667
- Put him down. Put him down.
- Mo? Mo? What's wrong with him?


685
00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:30.498
- Get back.
- Mo?


686
00:58:30.604 --> 00:58:33.536
<i>Come on. I need this
from you now. Come on, Mo.</i>

687
00:58:33.637 --> 00:58:35.695
Alana, come look at his chest.

688
00:58:35.805 --> 00:58:38.067
- He's bleeding.
- Could be his heart.


689
00:58:38.172 --> 00:58:40.195
- It's not his fucking heart!
- Come on!


690
00:58:40.306 --> 00:58:42.772
<i>- Come on, Mo. Come on.
- Get back.</i>


691
00:58:42.873 --> 00:58:45.772
- Give him some air.
- I'm a doctor, goddamn it.


692
00:58:45.873 --> 00:58:48.863
Mo. Oh, no! No!

693
00:58:48.974 --> 00:58:51.236
Oh, come on, Mo.

694
00:58:51.341 --> 00:58:53.603
<i>Come on, buddy.</i>

695
00:58:53.708 --> 00:58:56.573
<i>- Come on. Come on.
- What is going on?</i>


696
00:58:56.676 --> 00:58:59.108
- Get 'em out of here!
- Mo.


697
00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:02.608
Move it!

698
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:05.608
Get 'em all down there together
and close that bar.


699
00:59:14.712 --> 00:59:17.906
Where's Mitchy?
Where is she?


700
00:59:19.046 --> 00:59:21.377
She's dead.

701
00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:23.447
Mitchy's dead.

702
00:59:26.647 --> 00:59:28.977
What are you talking about?

703
00:59:31.482 --> 00:59:33.744
- She's dead.
- Mitchy!


704
00:59:33.849 --> 00:59:37.839
Mitchy! Mitchy!

705
00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:39.939
I'm getting out of here.

706
00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:44.112
Brace yourself.
We're gonna lock up.


707
00:59:53.286 --> 00:59:55.115
Walter.

708
00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:58.948
My God, what's the matter with Walter?
He should have hit the brakes.


709
01:00:13.757 --> 01:00:15.689
Emergency!

710
01:00:33.427 --> 01:00:35.893
We're gonna derail!
Ease off on the brakes!


711
01:00:43.129 --> 01:00:45.254
Brakes, now.

712
01:00:50.497 --> 01:00:53.259
Stop, damn you. Stop.

713
01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:44.402
What the hell happened here?

714
01:01:44.507 --> 01:01:46.406
<i>I don't know.</i>

715
01:01:48.007 --> 01:01:50.473
He must have got 'em both.

716
01:01:53.375 --> 01:01:56.569
Don't go back through
that train without this.


717
01:01:56.675 --> 01:02:01.268
Watch your step there.
Stay together. Don't go too far.


718
01:02:01.376 --> 01:02:03.934
Come on. Keep on moving,
everybody. Come on.


719
01:02:04.044 --> 01:02:09.444
Get yourselves a couple of fire axes
and search every damn inch of these cars.


720
01:02:09.545 --> 01:02:13.376
He could be anywhere.
And he's lethal, so stick together.


721
01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:15.707
And don't try to be heroes.

722
01:02:15.813 --> 01:02:18.608
If you just think you hear somethin',
you come hollerin' for help.


723
01:02:18.713 --> 01:02:20.612
Okay, chief.

724
01:02:20.714 --> 01:02:25.511
Keep moving.
Watch your step, please.


725
01:02:25.615 --> 01:02:27.547
- Hey, careful there.
- Stay together.


726
01:02:27.648 --> 01:02:30.114
Christ, the lights are gone.

727
01:02:52.887 --> 01:02:55.285
Everybody, take off your masks.

728
01:02:55.387 --> 01:02:58.649
<i>- I wanna know who's who.
- Tell us what's going on.</i>


729
01:02:58.754 --> 01:03:01.277
I will. Right now,
I'm telling you...


730
01:03:01.388 --> 01:03:04.548
to stay with your dates,
stick by your friends.


731
01:03:04.655 --> 01:03:07.121
Elaine? Dominic?

732
01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:17.189
Look out!

733
01:03:19.558 --> 01:03:21.456
<i>It's one of them little mothers.</i>

734
01:03:21.558 --> 01:03:24.081
<i>- Hey, asshole.
- Jackson?</i>


735
01:03:24.192 --> 01:03:27.420
<i>- Jackson?
- If this turns out to be another one of your stunts...</i>


736
01:03:27.526 --> 01:03:30.425
<i>Hey, you there, let go ofhim.</i>

737
01:03:31.727 --> 01:03:34.023
<i>- Herbie Green?
- Okay?</i>


738
01:03:34.127 --> 01:03:36.423
<i>Dan Irwin?</i>

739
01:03:36.528 --> 01:03:41.518
<i>I want the rest
of those masks off now. Hurry along there.</i>


740
01:03:41.629 --> 01:03:45.084
- How come it's just all my best friends
in the fucking world?
- What do we all have in common?


741
01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:48.129
- Jackson.
- You and me and Mitchy and the guys?


742
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:51.754
Doc, we hurt him.

743
01:03:51.864 --> 01:03:55.990
- What are you talking about?
- Kenny Hampson. Your stunt with the corpse.


744
01:03:56.098 --> 01:03:58.462
Nobody'd do that
for a goddamn prank.


745
01:03:58.565 --> 01:04:01.963
It wasn't just a prank.
Doc, he was sick.


746
01:04:03.533 --> 01:04:07.227
I went to the hospital
just afterwards.


747
01:04:07.333 --> 01:04:09.322
They wouldn't let me see him.

748
01:04:09.434 --> 01:04:11.367
They said he'd killed
somebody before.


749
01:04:11.468 --> 01:04:14.366
And they said it might have been
an accident, but he killed somebody.


750
01:04:19.135 --> 01:04:21.102
Shit.

751
01:04:22.537 --> 01:04:24.469
And we're next, aren't we?

752
01:04:26.337 --> 01:04:30.269
- Come on.
- No.


753
01:04:40.106 --> 01:04:42.005
<i>- Come on! Come on!
- I am.!</i>


754
01:04:42.107 --> 01:04:45.369
I'm trying to save your life,
for Christ's sake.


755
01:04:45.474 --> 01:04:48.929
Get going.
Here goes nothing.


756
01:04:49.041 --> 01:04:50.940
Now listen to me.

757
01:04:51.041 --> 01:04:53.735
I don't wanna
get back on that train.


758
01:04:53.842 --> 01:04:57.206
Nobody does.

759
01:04:57.309 --> 01:05:02.106
But we have no choice.
Nobody can make it if we stay up here.


760
01:05:07.178 --> 01:05:09.974
Couldn't find a thing.

761
01:05:10.079 --> 01:05:13.944
Come on.
We can't get on that train.


762
01:05:14.046 --> 01:05:18.035
<i>There are no roads up here.
Now, we'll put you all in one car.</i>


763
01:05:18.146 --> 01:05:20.544
With the killer!

764
01:05:20.647 --> 01:05:22.546
Bullshit. We can walk.

765
01:05:22.648 --> 01:05:24.910
You'll die.

766
01:05:25.015 --> 01:05:27.038
At this temperature, you'll die.

767
01:05:27.148 --> 01:05:30.309
What do you think you're doing?
He could be in here.


768
01:05:31.882 --> 01:05:34.212
<i>Lock, damn you.</i>

769
01:05:37.716 --> 01:05:39.615
Fuckin' animal.

770
01:05:39.717 --> 01:05:41.740
He can't do this to me.

771
01:05:41.851 --> 01:05:46.012
If you can keep your head while all about you
are losing theirs and blaming it on you.


772
01:05:46.119 --> 01:05:48.812
We are gonna die
unless we get some help!


773
01:05:48.919 --> 01:05:51.045
But I don't know who to trust anymore.

774
01:05:51.153 --> 01:05:53.983
I don't even trust you.

775
01:05:54.087 --> 01:05:56.054
You're so slow.

776
01:06:05.823 --> 01:06:10.085
Presto "chango." The same little shit.
Good old Kenny Hampson.


777
01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:14.945
I knew I never liked magic.

778
01:06:15.057 --> 01:06:17.047
The magician?

779
01:06:17.157 --> 01:06:20.783
We'll sit tight and when the train stops,
we'll play a trick on old Kenny.


780
01:06:20.891 --> 01:06:24.984
- The train is stopped.
- Then they better start it up again
'cause it's gonna...


781
01:06:25.093 --> 01:06:29.083
- He's back there with all of our friends!
- Let's hope so, huh?


782
01:06:29.194 --> 01:06:31.989
I don't believe you.

783
01:06:32.094 --> 01:06:35.493
He's gonna kill everybody!
We've gotta tell them!


784
01:06:35.594 --> 01:06:37.493
I'm not movin'.

785
01:06:40.662 --> 01:06:42.561
Every man for himself.

786
01:06:47.097 --> 01:06:49.620
Alana, don't.

787
01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:52.219
- Don't!
- Let go of me!


788
01:06:52.331 --> 01:06:55.627
Doc! Doc!

789
01:06:55.731 --> 01:06:57.595
Please. Doc!

790
01:06:57.698 --> 01:06:59.221
Doc!

791
01:06:59.332 --> 01:07:00.491
Doc!

792
01:07:01.899 --> 01:07:04.422
<i>Hey, you there.!</i>

793
01:07:04.533 --> 01:07:07.466
Go back outside, miss.

794
01:07:08.534 --> 01:07:10.500
<i>Please?</i>

795
01:07:33.805 --> 01:07:35.771
Oh, shit.

796
01:09:46.964 --> 01:09:50.590
No! No!

797
01:09:54.265 --> 01:09:56.231
Help!

798
01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.190
Mitchy.

799
01:10:11.034 --> 01:10:13.159
Oh, Jesus Christ.

800
01:10:15.768 --> 01:10:19.861
It's a joke.
A goddamn practical joke.


801
01:10:21.970 --> 01:10:26.404
We're the brothers of Sigma Phi Omega, right?
Brothers, remember?


802
01:10:26.505 --> 01:10:30.494
That means we're gonna stick together.
We're gonna look out for each other.


803
01:10:30.605 --> 01:10:34.368
<i>- We're gonna protect each other.
Now get on the train.
- Have you seen the conductor?</i>


804
01:10:34.472 --> 01:10:37.598
Anybody seen the conductor?

805
01:10:37.707 --> 01:10:39.764
- I know who it is.
- What?


806
01:10:39.874 --> 01:10:42.534
- Where's the conductor?
- Back there. Come on.


807
01:10:47.674 --> 01:10:50.971
God, it was cold out there.
My feet are numb.


808
01:10:51.076 --> 01:10:53.042
I told you to stay in the car.

809
01:10:53.143 --> 01:10:56.735
Well, they made me get off.
I mean, they had to search here.


810
01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:04.206
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is something missing?


811
01:11:06.879 --> 01:11:08.868
<i>Geez, I was scared out there.</i>

812
01:11:08.979 --> 01:11:14.242
I couldn't find you, and I'm thinking
this wacko's gonna jump out at me any minute.


813
01:11:14.347 --> 01:11:16.813
Hey, I should have
used one of these.


814
01:11:18.981 --> 01:11:20.947
Yeah, this would have done.
What do you think?


815
01:11:23.215 --> 01:11:27.170
- Let's go back, Alana. They'll be coming back.
- Doc?


816
01:11:27.282 --> 01:11:30.215
- It's okay. I'm with the prez.
- Damn it.


817
01:11:34.984 --> 01:11:38.041
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

818
01:11:38.151 --> 01:11:41.482
Well, whatever.
Have you ever shoveled any coal?


819
01:11:41.585 --> 01:11:43.483
- No.
- He's on the train.


820
01:11:43.585 --> 01:11:47.040
- Why isn't she lying down somewhere?
- The magician!


821
01:11:47.153 --> 01:11:50.586
- Magician?
- I'll show you. Come on.


822
01:11:50.686 --> 01:11:52.811
Doc's got the picture.

823
01:11:57.821 --> 01:12:01.481
<i>Doc, open up.</i>

824
01:12:01.588 --> 01:12:05.022
<i>Open up in there, please.</i>

825
01:12:05.122 --> 01:12:07.089
<i>Doc?</i>

826
01:12:08.123 --> 01:12:11.147
<i>Doc? I just left him in there.</i>

827
01:12:32.694 --> 01:12:35.217
Keep her outside.

828
01:13:02.866 --> 01:13:04.992
Don't go in there, miss.

829
01:14:11.812 --> 01:14:13.870
<i>Doc.!</i>

830
01:14:32.484 --> 01:14:35.177
You move out real quiet, darlin'.

831
01:14:35.284 --> 01:14:38.718
Hey, what's going on?

832
01:14:38.817 --> 01:14:42.307
We got the coffee maker workin', miss.

833
01:14:42.419 --> 01:14:44.941
Come on.

834
01:14:49.453 --> 01:14:53.250
<i>- Where is he?
- He's right back there.</i>


835
01:14:53.354 --> 01:14:55.718
Come on.

836
01:14:55.821 --> 01:14:57.719
Ken?

837
01:14:57.821 --> 01:15:01.720
<i>They made coffee out here.
I'll bring you in a cup, okay?</i>


838
01:15:11.124 --> 01:15:13.647
What's going on, for Christ sake?
What's happening, huh?


839
01:15:13.758 --> 01:15:16.589
This is only for your own safety.

840
01:15:30.827 --> 01:15:34.090
I guess nobody's been in this one
for a couple of years.


841
01:15:34.195 --> 01:15:37.787
You'll be able
to get some rest, yes, sir.


842
01:15:43.096 --> 01:15:46.620
It's a little dusty in here,
but it's clean.


843
01:15:46.730 --> 01:15:48.754
Come on in.

844
01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:04.595
- I hope you don't mind
no sheets and no pillowcases.
- No.


845
01:16:04.701 --> 01:16:06.599
- I'll get you some, though.
- No, please.


846
01:16:06.701 --> 01:16:10.361
Okay, okay, don't worry.
I won't leave this car.


847
01:16:10.468 --> 01:16:12.798
I'm gonna be
right outside that door.


848
01:17:18.847 --> 01:17:21.370
Come on now. Let us go, you guys.

849
01:17:21.481 --> 01:17:24.607
Out of my fucking way.

850
01:17:24.716 --> 01:17:27.546
- Let me through!
- What did you say, boy?


851
01:17:27.649 --> 01:17:31.173
- Say that again.
- Let us through or we'll break the door down.


852
01:17:31.283 --> 01:17:34.011
Shut up, all of you.

853
01:17:34.117 --> 01:17:38.050
I said, move off, sir.

854
01:17:38.152 --> 01:17:40.913
He killed a couple of ours.

855
01:17:41.018 --> 01:17:42.917
You aim to kill him?

856
01:17:46.753 --> 01:17:48.719
Give me the ax.

857
01:17:50.221 --> 01:17:52.915
Before you go...

858
01:17:53.021 --> 01:17:55.782
you take a look at the bodies
of some of your friends.


859
01:17:55.888 --> 01:17:58.411
Is it worth that, son?

860
01:18:00.789 --> 01:18:03.347
Well, is it worth it?

861
01:18:18.559 --> 01:18:20.718
I'll check it out myself.

862
01:18:54.665 --> 01:18:56.564
Hey, Ken.

863
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.432
<i>Come on out here.
I wanna talk to you.</i>


864
01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:05.792
Gotta turn the heat off back there.
You wanna come up to the lounge?


865
01:19:07.235 --> 01:19:09.428
<i>Gonna turn the lights off too.</i>

866
01:21:42.797 --> 01:21:45.059
<i>No.</i>

867
01:21:45.164 --> 01:21:47.925
No. No.

868
01:23:10.713 --> 01:23:12.838
Stop!

869
01:23:53.122 --> 01:23:54.610
Kenny.

870
01:23:58.589 --> 01:23:59.953
Kenny!

871
01:24:04.190 --> 01:24:05.849
<i>Kenny, please.</i>

872
01:25:20.837 --> 01:25:23.463
What happened?

873
01:25:23.571 --> 01:25:25.696
He killed Mo.

874
01:25:28.406 --> 01:25:30.565
<i>- Clear out!
- Get out of the way, you guys.</i>


875
01:25:30.673 --> 01:25:33.640
<i>- Back up!
- Come on. Back up, damn it.</i>


876
01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:36.104
Get out of the way.
Come on!


877
01:25:36.207 --> 01:25:38.696
Clear the way back there.

878
01:26:15.682 --> 01:26:18.876
We'll be there in about 15 minutes.
Would you like a cup of coffee?


879
01:26:18.982 --> 01:26:20.948
No, thanks.

880
01:27:49.799 --> 01:27:52.322
Hi. Listen, why don't you
come on back now.


881
01:27:52.433 --> 01:27:56.196
It's mellowed out and, well,
this place gives me the creeps.


882
01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:59.298
Okay.

883
01:28:38.442 --> 01:28:41.135
Why don't you come back
and join the...


884
01:28:41.241 --> 01:28:43.639
Join us. Come on.

885
01:29:00.912 --> 01:29:02.879
There's the light.

886
01:29:04.113 --> 01:29:07.170
Lord, that's beautiful.

887
01:29:08.847 --> 01:29:12.280
Go back and start the report,
Charlie. I'll bring her on in.


888
01:29:12.381 --> 01:29:14.347
Okay.

889
01:29:17.315 --> 01:29:19.304
- Got it?
- I got her.


890
01:29:19.415 --> 01:29:21.382
Okay.

891
01:30:57.301 --> 01:30:59.324
What the hell?

892
01:31:02.968 --> 01:31:06.526
Hey, Alana.

893
01:31:13.371 --> 01:31:15.963
Carne!

894
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:18.901
Oh, thank God. Charlie.

895
01:31:22.171 --> 01:31:24.365
The magician's dead.

896
01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:28.397
Jesus, I don't know
who it is anymore.


897
01:31:44.676 --> 01:31:46.370
No.

898
01:32:04.046 --> 01:32:06.512
It was you.

899
01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:12.738
Kenny, I'm sorry.

900
01:32:15.849 --> 01:32:18.680
I never told you,
I'm so sorry.


901
01:32:18.782 --> 01:32:21.578
You haven't changed.

902
01:32:25.183 --> 01:32:27.082
I saw your picture
in the yearbook.


903
01:32:27.184 --> 01:32:29.776
<i>I never knew you liked magic.</i>

904
01:32:29.884 --> 01:32:33.874
I watched you tonight.
You liked him.


905
01:32:33.985 --> 01:32:36.952
No.

906
01:32:37.053 --> 01:32:40.542
Kenny, you're better than he is.
I'm sure you're better than he is.


907
01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:43.549
I am.

908
01:32:43.653 --> 01:32:46.119
He didn't know how
to cut a woman into pieces.


909
01:32:46.221 --> 01:32:48.779
You don't have to do this.

910
01:32:48.888 --> 01:32:51.116
You don't have to do this.

911
01:32:51.222 --> 01:32:55.121
Kiss me, Alana.

912
01:32:55.223 --> 01:32:57.212
- Kiss me, Kenny.
- Kiss me.


913
01:32:57.323 --> 01:32:59.687
Kiss me.

914
01:32:59.790 --> 01:33:02.120
Kiss me.
