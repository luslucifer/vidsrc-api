00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.030
There're cars to get you
from point A to point B,

3
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.730
and there're cars to get you from
point A to point B really fast

4
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.980
Fast cars cost big money

5
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.750
and milllons of dollars in stake

6
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.300
there're people who do anything to win

7
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.750
people who take risks and never play safe

12
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.900
The eccentric who plays by his own rule

13
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.520
Oh, MichaeI and his
pocket driver is here, too

14
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.040
The dreamer, not sure where he is going

15
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.520
but he wants to get the fast

16
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.520

22
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.820
No! LA to Mike' house in
2 hours has already been done

23
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.020

Babobabo like a Bootsy Colllns around here

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.710
This is what I'm talking about. 
This is more that I like it

93
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.350
All right, she is ready to go

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.890
That's good to know, babe

95
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.290
The question is

96
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.230
Will she go fast?

97
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.550
No, we reduce the performance. 
You gave us the small check

98
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.890
Haha, funny

99
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.330
No, seriouly, it depends
on whoever drives the car

100
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.340
and you're total consult to 8,000 even

101
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.600
Oh baby, you talking about 8 stakes?

102
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.470
Then you got which pay for it

103
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.370
You gotta talk to Nate. 
You know that Nate owns this spot

104
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.810
We talk to the man

105
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.470
Not his beautiful employee

106
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.080
That's not gonna be possible

107
00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:01.210
-Why is that? -because the last
time I checked I was all woman

108
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:01.960
Wait a minute.

109
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.050
Smash me on coming
a George Bush. You, Nate?

110
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.190
Natasha Martin. 
Nate is my friend.

111
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.520
For 8 grand, you

112
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.500

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.530
How fast could this blue baby go

115
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.870
She will go 220 to 225 tops

116
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:23.370
220 to 225

117
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.740
Then you put some works in

118
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:26.870
May I put your money with your mouth

119
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.920
That is not very hygienic

120
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.210
Then I will give you a tic tac

121
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.180

122

-Hey, Tony, you check. 
-I'm on it

123
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.150
Be skiing

124
00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.420
who do you learn
how to drive like this

125
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.580
my father

126
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.770
He must put some training on everybody

127
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.410
you know you could just spot the harn

128
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:28.560
that would be rude

129
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:32.670

130
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:34.710

145
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.860
racing organization. 
You know what I'm saying?

146
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:27.030
No, I don't

147
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:28.400
What do you want?

148
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.640
Next races is outside vegas

149
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.370
You know it's like a flop crack game

150
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.500
stakes are high you got
pay bill to buy in

151
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:39.640
I don't race

152
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.680
But the stuff you pull on the track

153
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.320
That was pro. Pro stuff

154
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.420
Thank you

155
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.270
but the answer is still no

156
00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:48.280
Then play for me?

157
00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:49.450
play?

158
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.390
Yeah, you know, that's what
you did with your band

159
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.390
and the fellows at the garage

160
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.290

161
00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:55.430
Baby, you know what I'm say that

162
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.920
CD deallng.They got deep pockets

163
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.000
They cheered up

164
00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.400
We can get paid,

165
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.400
and it's like an entertainment
when they're watching the race

166
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.730
You wanna us to be
your own little music play girl

167
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:06.790
Exactly

168
00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.310
I'll think about it

169
00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.210
Don't think too long, girl

170
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.140
Study long study wrong!
Man like me don't hang up too often

171
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:25.720

172
00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:02.890

174
00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.300
Who own this? your boyfriend?

175
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.370
what did you say?

176
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.330

177
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.230
Wooo.. take it easy, man

178
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:15.900
What do you want then?

179
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:19.610

182
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:24.370
You don't want the peace, young man

183
00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.140
Get off

184
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.570
-They got the gun 
-Go

185
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.220
That was close

186
00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.930
You are still getting into trouble huh?

187
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.890
Something is never changed

188
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.790
Welcome home, war hero

189
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:16.260

Look, I'm not involved in the
family business that's you get again

192
00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.010
MichaeI maybe mean to be,
but he isn't the family

193
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.670
and whatever he is up to
now i can garantee it's no good

194
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.270
He's the crook, okay! 
He always has been

195
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.370
He always will be

196
00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:32.710
He just destroyed our family

197
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.520
Why can't you see that
why you still be stupid still

198
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.180
Now here we are

199
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.260
We are not kids anymore

200
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.360
4 years later and nothing's changed

201
00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.050
Except your stupid hair cut

202
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.930
Carlo

203
00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:46.960
Jason

204
00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.720
llghting up

205
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.060
Natasha

206
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.600
You were here, honey?

207
00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.730
so you only gotta go to
Vegas to sing and not race

208
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.970
You heard huh?

209
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.370
I wanna do it
so badly but i can't

210
00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.570
You know, sometimes things
that we are afraid of

211
00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.050
things that we really want the most

212
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.640
Did I say that I was afraid?

213
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.620
Nope

214
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:15.910
You never do

215
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.650
You just like your father

216
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.530
I don't think he's ever afraid of anything

217
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.160
Well, he had you fool, you know?

218
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:29.970
Honey

219
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:32.910
Yeah

220
00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:34.370
He was afraid

221
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.370
not to be head of the pack

222
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.470
not to be the man of the bees

223
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.080
not to be the apple
of this little girI's eye

224
00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.580
But he was

225
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.040
I know

226
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:49.580
Come here

227
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.620
Ohh

228
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.090
Baby

229
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.000
Come over here, girl

230
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:03.860
Okay

231
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.260
Too far away

232
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:07.930
That one get hold

233
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.370
Tag

234
00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.920
Why you put your
backwards like a fool, man?

235
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.050
People don't like to
make a race like this

236
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.550
They get out of there first

237
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.660
We got no power to
catch up to them. They don't

238
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.390
Its easy to see a hundred thousand

239
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:28.930
What if you don't make it through?

240
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.900
What happened to you to see your unemployed like, man. 
Think positive!

241
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.190
I thought it's a GT

242
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.200
was modified

243
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.790
for the race out side of vegas

244
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.530
You must belleve i lost my mind

245
00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.730
Before I loved the car deallng

246
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.670
is inexpensive car for the inexpensive race

247
00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.680
We got break out horse power

248
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.210
with the big boys

249
00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:51.350
We don't bring out the SI
all for the race outside vegas

250
00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.680
Okay

251
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.480
Now stop distracting me

252
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.910
Who's this about

253
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.520
Yeah money is in the place

254
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:24.210
Go!

255
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.350
Yeah, there we are

256
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.580

273
00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:24.400
Ahh, great

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:25.500
We need him

275

The dumb is right here for 2 days

276
00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:28.200

You gonna drive for me

278
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:30.910
Me?

279
00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:32.640
It's been 3 milllon dallors. 
Are you crazy?

280
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:33.800
Look, I can drive

281
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.610
but I don't know I'm not up today

282
00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.750
Don't worry about it

283
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.420
Just play so good as
SI game in the track

you around a little bit

289
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.680

We're at 20000 feet

334
00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.520
You started to eat 20000 pieces of candies

335
00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.150
Your ass will get so wild

336
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.290
I could get my hands around ya

337
00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.930

338
00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.230
Pull over! Pull over right now!

339
00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.940
Get all your stuff out of here

340
00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:19.980
You're such a bastard

341
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.550
Thanks for your fllght

342
00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:24.020
Don't forger your hat

343
00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.110
It's hot out there

344
00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:28.090
oh I know he is a bastard

345
00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:29.180
Go to the hell

346
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.590
I don't wanna hear the crack around here

347
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:32.720
he loses his mind

348
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.320
What's just happening

349
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.760
The girI is getting a anger management issue,

350
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.390
She have gotta be
really low for 3 months

351
00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.130
She'll get her in balance

352
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:05.000
This is crazy.

353
00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.360
I know. Look at this place.

354
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.120
That building every five minutes
goes up here looks like..

355
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.560
Where are we going,little brother?

356
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:15.400
Where we are not going. 
I am taking you to the hottest club in Les Vegas.

357
00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:21.600
What's up?

358
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:22.600
Goog evening!

359
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:24.540
Hey,keep it close man.

360
00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.230
Thank you.

361
00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:30.180
-Jason 
-Antony, what's going on?

362
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.620
Come and see. This is my brother Carlo.

363
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.120
Just back from lraq. 
I'm gonna show you a good time tonight,huh?

364
00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.220
what are we doing and wait out here.

365
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:38.250
Get us inside.

366
00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:01.910
-He just never gonna
stop! -this is the basis

367
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.670
Look at the girls
who are checking you out.

368
00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.300
Why don't you go and buy them a few drinks. 
Maybe you'll get lucky.

369
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:28.240
Ok, I'll get this round.

370
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.140
Stan!

371
00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:40.980
She is cute.

372
00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.550
Hey, can I buy you a drink?

373
00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.620
Hah, no, thanks. 
I've already had one.

374
00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:46.560
Let's go for a dance.

375
00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.360
No thanks. I'm just waiting for my friends.

376
00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.760
Come on. They'll wait. Come on.

377
00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:50.960
-I said no. 
-Come on!

378
00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:51.930
I said no!

379
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:54.160
Screw you!

380
00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.410
Jason, get the car!

381
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.740
What's the hell are you doing?

382
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.540
Some guy grabbed me and another guy...

383
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:15.480
Get him!

384
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.990
-Hey! 
-Sorry!

385
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.070
Hey, Carlo, get in the car!

386
00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:39.470
Go!

387
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:43.950
What was that?

388
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:45.040
Nothing. Let's go.

389
00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:47.180
Go!Go!

390
00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.450
Huh,over a girl, Carlo. 
You gotta to be kidding.

391
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:59.020
That's him!

392
00:25:59.370 --> 00:25:59.830
Jay!

393
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:01.030
We got a company

394
00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:08.100
All right. Let's see
what these guys can do.

395
00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:36.770
Come on, come on!

396
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:44.480
Jay!

397
00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:50.710
Jay, Jay, Jay!

398
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.920
-You are not gonna make it! 
-I'll make it!

399
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:16.870
I told you that you
were not gonna make it.

400
00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:17.470
Shut up!

401
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.640
What is the most important to
my movie. I'll talk to A.J,

402
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:23.210
You just get this guy
in two weeks and three days

403
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:23.710
Jerry!

404
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.250
Just shoot him out,
shoot him against the wall.

405
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.340
Shoot him through the swords.

406
00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:29.180
I'm sick and tired of you
every single time we play poker?

407
00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.190
What's the bet on the sea?

408
00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.220
-100 -50 grand on the sea

409
00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.060
Get off the phone,man. 
We get a poker to play.

410
00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.390
-Get him on the set. 
-Guys, what do you think of this?

411
00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.720
Nice shirt by the way

412
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:38.800
You get that from your girI friend?

413
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:40.160
No, I got it from yours.

414
00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:44.560
Get it? Get it. Good. 
Ok, where are we?

415
00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:45.760
One fifty.

416
00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.290
I love betting!

417
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.030
There are chips in the kitchen,

418
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.000
I think you gonna want
some dip a little bit

419
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:23.100
Thank you. I appreciate it. 
You are a good guy. 
Thanks for taking my money.

420
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.640
I appreciate it.

421
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.940
-Good luck. 
-Good luck.

422
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.180
Yeah, tell Jerry the Enzo's windshield is shattered.

423
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.390
It's gonna take three days
to order a new one.

424
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:38.080
I'll tell him.

425
00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:38.990
Two hundred.

426
00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:40.620
Now, what is it?

427
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:42.320
The windshield of the Enzo is broken.

428
00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:44.040
Oh, come on. I need
that car for the race.

429
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.800
How much the Farrari Enzo will cost again?

430
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:50.560
1 .2milllon,sir.

431
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.030
How much is in the pile?

432
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:53.160
About 1 .5.

433
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.560
I'm all in.

434
00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.400
My call. I get three aces.

435
00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.040
The river is two of hearts.

436
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:03.610
Oh, my god!

437
00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.180
You'd better get those aces fixed.

438
00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:06.520
I am in my flush

439
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.250
Hey, guess what's the
gamble if you don't gamble

440
00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.390
which reminds me I
got to go my race.

441
00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:30.940
Start the engine,man.

442
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.890
Walk it up, walk
it into the field man!

443
00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:57.690
What plan is it?

444
00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.700
This, my big brother,

445
00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:01.240
is where fortunes are won

446
00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:02.840
and lost.

447
00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:07.280
Now promise me you'll be cool,

448
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:08.910
especially around uncle Michael.

449
00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:12.520
Come on.

450
00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:33.370
-Hi! 
-Hi, Cover

451
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:35.770
What's up, pretty man?

452
00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.670
Hi,mate! Got your hands.

453
00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.580
-Yeah,of course. 
-Good looking then

454
00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:01.160
After we get this fortune, we can more...

455
00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:10.370
Uncle Michael.

456
00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.140
Look who's coming on to us.

457
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:15.410

Good to see you!

463
00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.390
You haven't changed.

464
00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.920
Hmm, what do you want for my brother?

465
00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.930
We just hang out these days.

466
00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:34.120

Wow,wow,wow,let me talk to the guy.

474
00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.520
Yeah, I know,I know.

475
00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:02.890
But you got to remember that the
universe can inspire us all the experience

476
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.550
to a learning proess,kid.

477
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:06.090
Our days are numbered,

478
00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:06.890

479
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:09.930
So aren't there fun?

Don't you see that?

482
00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.400
Oh,shit! This guy is tough.

Do you understand?

628
00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:58.080
Don't get distracted,ok?

629
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.950
Uh-hah.

633
00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:13.170
This is the bitch you
should be paying attention to.

634
00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.130
Yes,sir!

635
00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:18.510
Oh,it hurts.

636
00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:20.410
-It really hurts.

640
00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:28.920
Really?

641
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:30.050
We could talk about this.

642
00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:31.920

Yep, just it happens and looks
a ittle excited for the race.

646
00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:05.650
You don't look so excited.

647
00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.160
I was just thinking,

648
00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:09.520
maybe you are right,

649
00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:13.500
maybe uncle MicheaI is not
such a good guy after all.

650
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:17.230
What did you say?

651
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.670
Nothing,really.

652
00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:20.270
Just the race.

653
00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:25.140

654
00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:26.980

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:56.740
Nothing,nothing, baby, I'm cool.

661
00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:59.410
Uh,you gonna win this race, right?

662
00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.610
Please, I'll smoke them.

663
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:04.040
-Are you sure about that? 
-Yeah,I am.

664
00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.550

Oh, yeah.

670
00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:20.770
You know I think my driver

671
00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:24.270
would be pretty much unbeatable
than your sexy little red Enzo.

672
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:26.430
Unbeatable? What is unbeatable?

673
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.940
I tell you what, 
I would bet that sexy little red Enzo,

674
00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.980
your driver loses this race.

675
00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.170
I like the sound of that

676
00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.250
One platinum bar

677
00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:35.570
No, I don't like that

678

My nephew died.

807
00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:37.850

826
00:55:17.590 --> 00:55:19.720
We are going to tell
our gandkids when it's ready

827
00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.720
So, just relax, you are safe.

828
00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:24.730
Just change your clothes in the wardrobe,

829
00:55:24.830 --> 00:55:25.420
Come down.

830
00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:26.890
Whatever you want, you are free to run.

831
00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:30.030
Ok.this is seed food for you now

But that isn't gonna happened here, okay

834
00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:38.410
We don't eat things which have faces.

835
00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:41.110
I belleve animaI are the sainted creatrues

836
00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:42.940
Just like you and me,though.

837
00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:47.670
I have been disappointed by...every women.

838
00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:50.220
Being mad, including my mother

839
00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:53.280
You are not gonna be dispointed me.

840

Look past yourjudgement.

842
00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:02.620
Mr. Razio

843
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:10.360
There are kind of problems
we can fit the money

844
00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.030
The prints of the flow,they won't accepet it.

845
00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:17.300
So fixed it.

846
00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.870
You don't have enough time here.

847
00:58:42.290 --> 00:58:43.880
Hello, Michael.

848
00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:46.930
Your good new currency was protected.

849
00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:49.400
Thoes prints are not accepetable.

850
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:50.960
that is why I burnt it all.

851
00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:52.690
Just give me a bit more time.

852
00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.270
-It is gonna be prefect 
-I have already given you more time.

853

Your deal is to have
a 8 milllon in possibile currency.

854

855
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:05.310
I don't have 8 milllon in reaI currency.

856
00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:07.610
I just don't have it.

862
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:19.860
Do you hear me?

863
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:22.090

-What? 
-Trust me.

877
01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.480
What the hell are you doing there?

878
01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:56.380
Well, what are you doing there?

879
01:01:56.490 --> 01:01:58.010
I don't know how
I entered up that room,ok?

880
01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.210
Trust me,that wasn't by choice.

881
01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:01.950
I was kinnapped.

882
01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:02.990
Kidnapped?

883
01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:05.250
By my uncle.

884
01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:07.500
The guy is your uncle?

885
01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:11.900
He killed my brother and I
just came to pay him back.

886
01:02:15.970 --> 01:02:18.240
Thanks for saving me again.

887
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:21.500
You go to find a place
to get rid off the car.

888
01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:23.040
It is a quick flojet.

889
01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:24.510
They can track us.

890
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:25.580
Go up here.

891
01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:27.910
They said you gonna llve. What is up?

892
01:02:28.690 --> 01:02:30.710

My father died in the same way.

926
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:58.620
I was sitting in
the stand when it happened.

927
01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:08.860

01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:27.450

01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:23.410
I'm a little busy,Jerry.

943
01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:24.770
You don't want to miss this,man.

Oh,you are so crazy. I like it.

949
01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:42.460
Ok,make it happen.

950
01:07:42.570 --> 01:07:45.090
Hey,what's the gamble if you don't gamble.

951
01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.340
Hey,come on,people, time is my money.

952
01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:55.480
Michael,Jahnothan's machine is broken,

953
01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:59.510
we can't print anymore money, you
don't have $25 milllon to bet.

954
01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.380
You have to sell everything.

955
01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:04.310
So, sell it.

956
01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:05.990
It is plenty of it

957
01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:06.990
I would like to spend.

958
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:09.520
We don't have the driver.

959
01:08:10.890 --> 01:08:11.950
Jason's died.

960
01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.090

961
01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.300
We need somebody to win,michael.

962
01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.290
I know,just the bitch.

963
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:22.300
Good morning.

964
01:08:29.010 --> 01:08:30.950
You think they're still after us?

965
01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:33.110
Possibily.

966
01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:35.950
Well,I think your uncle
may have a bigger problem.

967
01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:38.010
I mean,I overheard them talking on the phone.

968
01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.150
He owned somebody a lot of money.

969
01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.790
More than he can cover.

970
01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:43.080

971
01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:47.390

977
01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:01.280
Don't forget the windows this time.

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.040
I won't.

979

Good morning,man.

980
01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:27.700
What the hell was that?

981
01:09:29.010 --> 01:09:29.770
It is cool, dude.

982
01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.600
-Hey,it is ok. 
-We can talk.

983
01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:47.690
What's the deal?

984
01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:50.760
Harry.

985
01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:53.020
Stop,what do you want?

986
01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.700
Guys,what happened?

987
01:10:07.410 --> 01:10:08.540
Where is mom?

988
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:09.970
