the blizzards or the roads.


1006
00:54:47.225 --> 00:54:48.526
You tell them they
get over here now


1007
00:54:48.528 --> 00:54:49.961
and then you call administration

1008

1009
00:54:52.497 --> 00:54:54.501

1010
00:54:57.135 --> 00:54:59.370

1021

Thank you for your
feedback Louise but,


1025
00:55:44.383 --> 00:55:46.584
we do have it under control uh,

1026
00:55:46.586 --> 00:55:51.321
what we really need is for you
to return to your rooms now.


1027
00:55:51.323 --> 00:55:54.193
I'm not goin' anywhere
until you tell us why.


1028
00:55:59.265 --> 00:56:00.267
Very well.

1029
00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:04.167
It appears that Tina
has died in her room.


1030
00:56:04.169 --> 00:56:06.669
We don't know if there
was any fowl play.


1031
00:56:06.671 --> 00:56:08.171
It may have been an accident.

1032
00:56:08.173 --> 00:56:13.012
But it looks like someone
else was with her.


1033
00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:15.412
There was a piece of evidence

1034
00:56:15.414 --> 00:56:17.048
- left in Tina's room
- What the fuck?


1035
00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:21.285
and we now have that
evidence in our possession.


1036
00:56:21.287 --> 00:56:22.752
The authorities are on their way

1037
00:56:22.754 --> 00:56:26.490
and when they arrive we will
give them this evidence.


1038
00:56:26.492 --> 00:56:31.098
Without a doubt it will point
whoever else was there so,


1039
00:56:32.432 --> 00:56:35.502
if that person would like
to step forward at any time,


1040
00:56:36.635 --> 00:56:38.736
it could help clear
things up perhaps.


1041
00:56:38.738 --> 00:56:42.376
But if not, we can only
assume their guilt,


1042
00:56:44.376 --> 00:56:47.113
and when the authorities arrive,

1043
00:56:49.247 --> 00:56:52.052
they will be
charged with murder.


1044
00:56:53.852 --> 00:56:58.789
Now I have to go to my office
and call Tina's family.


1045

return to your room
