1
00:01:29.553 --> 00:01:31.253
Mr. Stenza...

2
00:01:31.347 --> 00:01:34.973
Please, call me Theodore.

3
00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:38.593
Maybe it's best
if we keep this formal.


4
00:01:38.687 --> 00:01:42.564
I'm afraid, Mr. Stenza,
that we are out of options.


5
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.024
Out of options?

6
00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.859
I mean, there's always options.

7
00:01:46.946 --> 00:01:49.571
You've defaulted
on your payment.


8
00:01:49.657 --> 00:01:52.365
Sir, I was laid off.

9
00:01:52.451 --> 00:01:53.992
I've been on more
job interviews than


10
00:01:54.078 --> 00:01:55.202
you could ever imagine.

11
00:01:55.287 --> 00:01:56.556
Then all of the sudden
the job interviews


12
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.871
started to dry up.

13
00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.875
You'd think after 40 years
of engineering experience


14
00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:05.254
that might mean something,
but to them it was...


15
00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:08.632
that I'm old.

16
00:02:08.758 --> 00:02:11.677
I'm not old.

17
00:02:11.762 --> 00:02:14.388
And, sir...

18
00:02:14.473 --> 00:02:16.848
I haven't given up.

19
00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:19.685
Well, I admire
your persistence, but...


20
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.063
Please, listen.

21
00:02:23.148 --> 00:02:25.649
Let's just make a deal.

22
00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:27.142
I'm told you
already worked one out


23
00:02:27.236 --> 00:02:29.236
with my predecessor.

24
00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:31.146
Then let's make another deal!

25
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.447
Please, let's make another deal!

26
00:02:35.953 --> 00:02:39.288
My wife and I have
worked our entire lives


27
00:02:39.373 --> 00:02:43.325
to make that house our home.

28
00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.044
For our family...

29
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.547
for our son.

30
00:02:48.632 --> 00:02:51.173
And ever since I lost them,

31
00:02:51.302 --> 00:02:55.837
that house is all
I have left of them.


32
00:02:55.931 --> 00:02:58.724
Look, I'm sorry,
but it's out of my hands.


33
00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:02.144
You have 35 days to
vacate the premises.


34
00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.014
Mr. Stenza...

35
00:03:06.108 --> 00:03:08.650
do you understand?

36
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.830
Oh, Mr. Stenza!

37
00:03:24.834 --> 00:03:29.087
It says here that
you are a veteran?


38
00:03:30.424 --> 00:03:33.133
Thank you for your service.

39
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.848
Mitch!

40
00:05:02.933 --> 00:05:04.558
Yeah?

41
00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:07.811
No, wait, let me guess.

42
00:05:07.938 --> 00:05:13.108
One of your friends
is pregnant again.


43
00:05:13.193 --> 00:05:15.068
Better.

44
00:05:15.154 --> 00:05:16.736
Better, uh...

45
00:05:16.822 --> 00:05:18.155
twins!

46
00:05:18.282 --> 00:05:21.533
Speaking of babies,
what's the one thing


47
00:05:21.618 --> 00:05:23.485
that's stopping us
from having one?


48
00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:25.579
We've been married
for three months.


49
00:05:25.664 --> 00:05:26.664
Cold.

50
00:05:26.832 --> 00:05:28.990
We want to enjoy
each other and have


51
00:05:29.084 --> 00:05:31.918
enough fun to last a
lifetime before we do?


52
00:05:32.004 --> 00:05:34.045
Colder.

53
00:05:34.131 --> 00:05:35.005
Our dream house.

54
00:05:35.132 --> 00:05:37.090
There's my
smart husband.


55
00:05:37.176 --> 00:05:38.176
Mm-hmm.

56
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.468
And...

57
00:05:39.553 --> 00:05:41.553
there it is.

58
00:05:41.638 --> 00:05:43.013
Foreclosure?

59
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.016
Hmm, that is a far cry
from our dream house.


60
00:05:46.143 --> 00:05:48.602
This is more house
than we'd be able to afford


61
00:05:48.687 --> 00:05:50.604
for the next five years.

62
00:05:50.688 --> 00:05:53.315
It's a perfect
first home for us.


63
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.849
For our family.

64
00:05:54.943 --> 00:05:56.776
The auction
is tomorrow.


65
00:05:56.862 --> 00:05:57.942
Which
means maybe not


66
00:05:57.988 --> 00:05:59.613
a lot of people know about it.

67
00:05:59.698 --> 00:06:01.176
Plus, we've already
talked to the bank


68
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.492
and we know what we've
been approved for.


69
00:06:03.577 --> 00:06:06.161
Ugh.

70
00:06:06.246 --> 00:06:09.748
I don't know, honey, I
don't think we're ready.


71
00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:14.002
Okay, then,
when will we be?


72
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:19.874
It's a scary, huge
adult life step.


73
00:06:19.968 --> 00:06:23.094
And that is what
married people do.


74
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.140
They take a bunch of adult
life steps together.


75
00:06:27.226 --> 00:06:30.435
Let's at least try, huh?

76
00:06:30.521 --> 00:06:32.771
You bid up to the number
the bank gave us


77
00:06:32.856 --> 00:06:35.690
and maybe we get lucky.

78
00:06:38.362 --> 00:06:39.903
Okay, I'll go.

79
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.530
Yes!

80
00:06:43.617 --> 00:06:45.784
Oh hey, that
bracelet looks


81
00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:48.370
mighty nice on you.

82
00:06:48.455 --> 00:06:50.497
Uh-oh.

83
00:06:50.582 --> 00:06:54.668
Besides,
you are my sun,


84
00:06:54.753 --> 00:07:00.840
my moon, and my stars.

85
00:07:06.473 --> 00:07:08.117
All right, folks,
you are going to love me


86
00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:09.266
for this one.

87
00:07:09.393 --> 00:07:12.227
Next up is the residence at

88
00:07:12.312 --> 00:07:13.853
Do I hear 425?

89
00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:16.106
I got 425, do we hear 430?

90
00:07:16.233 --> 00:07:18.984
430, bidder, bidder, 430,

91
00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:22.195
Bidder 425 going once,

92
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:23.488
430.

93
00:07:23.574 --> 00:07:25.051
Going to need
to speak up, son.


94
00:07:25.075 --> 00:07:26.324
430.

95
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.284
430, got 430.

96
00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:28.411
Do I hear 433...

97
00:07:28.453 --> 00:07:29.327
I got 433.

98
00:07:29.413 --> 00:07:30.445
433.

99
00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:31.539
Candidate Two: 435!

100
00:07:31.623 --> 00:07:33.582
435, new
bid's 435, 435, 435.


101
00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:37.210
Okay, 435 going once,

102
00:07:37.296 --> 00:07:38.296
438.

103
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.630
438 is a new
bid, 438, 440, 440, 440,


104
00:07:40.757 --> 00:07:42.215
bidder 440, bidder,
bidder, bidder.


105
00:07:42.301 --> 00:07:44.175
440, 440, 440?

106
00:07:44.261 --> 00:07:47.804
Okay, 438 going once,

107
00:07:49.224 --> 00:07:50.765
Sold.

108
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.304
Congratulations, son.

109
00:07:56.398 --> 00:07:57.639
Thank you.

110
00:07:57.733 --> 00:08:00.358
Ah, let me guess,
you went over


111
00:08:00.444 --> 00:08:02.027
your target number.

112
00:08:02.112 --> 00:08:03.612
By the price
of approximately


113
00:08:03.697 --> 00:08:04.904
one honeymoon.

114
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.615
Oh, newlyweds!

115
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.700
Yeah.

116
00:08:08.577 --> 00:08:09.577
That you got the house.

117
00:08:09.661 --> 00:08:10.785
It's kind of a silver lining.

118
00:08:10.871 --> 00:08:11.871
Thank you.

119
00:08:11.955 --> 00:08:13.204
You
own a bank sale.


120
00:08:15.834 --> 00:08:17.959
And bad life choices
lose them everything,


121
00:08:18.045 --> 00:08:20.754
but it means that a nice,
lovely young couple such as


122
00:08:20.839 --> 00:08:23.757
yourselves get to start
their lives out properly.


123
00:08:23.842 --> 00:08:26.051
Then it's not so tragic.

124
00:08:26.136 --> 00:08:27.761
That's a way
of looking at it.


125
00:08:27.846 --> 00:08:29.326
Okay,
enough of my rambling.


126
00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:32.265
Go tell that wife of
yours the good news.


127
00:08:32.351 --> 00:08:33.265
I will.

128
00:08:33.352 --> 00:08:35.226
And thanks again, I really
appreciate this.


129
00:09:24.528 --> 00:09:27.028
What the hell?

130
00:09:27.114 --> 00:09:28.114
Ahh!

131
00:09:57.477 --> 00:09:59.477
No, no, no,
don't worry about me,


132
00:09:59.563 --> 00:10:00.645
I've got this.

133
00:10:00.731 --> 00:10:01.958
Damn, girl,
you been working out?


134
00:10:01.982 --> 00:10:03.314
I know.

135
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.432
You need help?

136
00:10:04.526 --> 00:10:05.400
No, I got it.

137
00:10:05.485 --> 00:10:06.609
Hey, be careful, please.

138
00:10:06.737 --> 00:10:08.177
I'm three
feet off the ground.


139
00:10:08.238 --> 00:10:09.362
I think I'm going to be okay.

140
00:10:09.448 --> 00:10:11.281
Now, are you sure
you want this down?


141
00:10:11.408 --> 00:10:15.160
Oh, I have big
plans for this porch.


142
00:10:15.245 --> 00:10:16.745
Is there any
part of the house


143
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.788
that you don't have
big plans for?


144
00:10:18.915 --> 00:10:20.615
My office.

145
00:10:20.709 --> 00:10:23.117
I have even bigger
plans for that.


146
00:10:23.211 --> 00:10:25.628
Oh, okay,
look at you.


147
00:10:25.756 --> 00:10:27.338
Could you, uh...

148
00:10:27.424 --> 00:10:28.882
Oh, yeah, sorry.

149
00:10:28.967 --> 00:10:29.883
Thank you.

150
00:10:29.968 --> 00:10:31.009
Yeah.

151
00:10:31.094 --> 00:10:32.594
Such a gentleman!

152
00:10:32.679 --> 00:10:34.262
You know.

153
00:10:34.347 --> 00:10:35.963
You know me!

154
00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.945
Are you as
happy as I am?


155
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.572
I am.

156
00:11:34.658 --> 00:11:37.951
And a little overwhelmed.

157
00:11:38.036 --> 00:11:40.453
Is that good?

158
00:11:40.539 --> 00:11:42.539
Mostly.

159
00:11:42.666 --> 00:11:44.499
It's a lot.

160
00:11:44.584 --> 00:11:46.709
I think I need a raise.

161
00:11:46.837 --> 00:11:48.586
And you need more patients.

162
00:11:51.383 --> 00:11:53.383
I just hope we're up for this.

163
00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:54.510
We will be.

164
00:11:54.594 --> 00:11:57.637
We've got a whole
lifetime to work on it.


165
00:12:09.067 --> 00:12:11.025
What are you
thinking about?


166
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:14.612
How weird it is
to look to my right


167
00:12:14.698 --> 00:12:17.398
and not see the kitchen.

168
00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.957
It's a little late
for a welcome party.


169
00:12:26.042 --> 00:12:27.667
Hmm.

170
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.640
Can I help you?

171
00:12:42.726 --> 00:12:43.925
I know it's late.

172
00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:45.779
Forgive me so much for
intruding on you guys,


173
00:12:45.812 --> 00:12:49.063
but I'm Theodore.

174
00:12:49.149 --> 00:12:52.025
Theodore Stenza?

175
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.068
This used to be my home.

176
00:12:54.154 --> 00:12:55.436
Mitch?

177
00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.773
Umm, Mr. Stenza,
we're about go to bed.


178
00:12:58.867 --> 00:13:00.283
I realize that.

179
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:05.580
I just wanted to say good-bye.

180
00:13:05.665 --> 00:13:08.374
Is that okay?

181
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.544
Of course,
Mr. Stenza.


182
00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.670
Yeah.

183
00:13:12.756 --> 00:13:13.671
Please, come in.

184
00:13:13.757 --> 00:13:14.672
Thank you so much.

185
00:13:14.758 --> 00:13:16.132
Yeah.

186
00:13:24.267 --> 00:13:26.059
Well, I must
confess that I'm not here


187
00:13:26.144 --> 00:13:29.687
to exchange pleasantries,
Mr. Bordine.


188
00:13:29.773 --> 00:13:32.473
I've been talking to all
of my cousins and my aunts


189
00:13:32.567 --> 00:13:34.475
and my uncles, and we
believe we can raise


190
00:13:34.569 --> 00:13:37.070
the money right up to
about what you guys paid.


191
00:13:37.155 --> 00:13:38.863
Um...

192
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:41.199
I'm sorry, are you
saying you want to...


193
00:13:41.284 --> 00:13:43.952
Buy my house back.

194
00:13:44.037 --> 00:13:46.120
Please.

195
00:13:49.459 --> 00:13:52.377
Listen, I, I
completely understand


196
00:13:52.462 --> 00:13:54.795
where you're coming from, but...

197
00:13:54.881 --> 00:13:56.831
Do you, really?

198
00:13:56.925 --> 00:14:00.635
Young man, you and
your lovely wife


199
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.179
are just getting started.

200
00:14:03.306 --> 00:14:06.265
You have your entire
lives to build beautiful,


201
00:14:06.351 --> 00:14:08.518
loving memories together.

202
00:14:08.645 --> 00:14:12.355
This is all I have
left of my wife.


203
00:14:12.482 --> 00:14:15.024
My family.

204
00:14:15.151 --> 00:14:19.854
I literally built
this house for us.


205
00:14:19.948 --> 00:14:23.574
This is the life
we built together.


206
00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:30.289
So, please, let me
buy my house back.


207
00:14:35.088 --> 00:14:38.539
When you did
you lose your wife?


208
00:14:38.633 --> 00:14:42.635
Five years ago, yesterday.

209
00:14:42.721 --> 00:14:49.100
And when I'm in here,
it's as if she never left.


210
00:14:49.185 --> 00:14:53.521
It can be hard,
saying good-bye.


211
00:14:53.606 --> 00:14:55.890
That's why
I don't want to have to.


212
00:14:55.984 --> 00:14:57.567
I understand.

213
00:14:57.694 --> 00:15:01.112
I understand how it feels
when a door closes.


214
00:15:01.197 --> 00:15:03.448
Especially if we don't
know how, where,


215
00:15:03.533 --> 00:15:06.409
or when the next door will open.

216
00:15:06.536 --> 00:15:11.330
Fear, insecurity, even panic.

217
00:15:11.416 --> 00:15:13.741
Well, I'm not
scared, I'm not panicking.


218
00:15:13.835 --> 00:15:17.336
I know, because you
are one of those people


219
00:15:17.422 --> 00:15:19.580
who makes things happen.

220
00:15:19.674 --> 00:15:22.508
For people like you,
who are persistent,


221
00:15:22.594 --> 00:15:27.513
another door does always open.

222
00:15:33.396 --> 00:15:37.356
I want my house back.

223
00:15:37.442 --> 00:15:39.692
It's just that simple.

224
00:15:39.778 --> 00:15:41.602
And I can be persistent.

225
00:15:41.696 --> 00:15:44.363
Look, you're right,
I don't know what


226
00:15:44.449 --> 00:15:47.450
it's like to lose my house or...

227
00:15:47.577 --> 00:15:49.827
my wife.

228
00:15:49.913 --> 00:15:54.415
You know, I feel for you,
sir, I really do.


229
00:15:54.501 --> 00:15:59.453
But we can't sell
you this house.


230
00:15:59.547 --> 00:16:03.290
Even if we wanted to, after
closing costs and moving


231
00:16:03.384 --> 00:16:07.720
costs and everything else,
we'd be going in the hole.


232
00:16:07.806 --> 00:16:15.636
So, I'm sorry, but
this is our house now.


233
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.106
I understand.

234
00:16:18.191 --> 00:16:20.983
Well, under the circumstances,

235
00:16:21.111 --> 00:16:23.903
I can't say I wish
you all the best.


236
00:16:23.988 --> 00:16:28.574
But I do respect
the both of you,


237
00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.494
and I respect your decision.

238
00:16:31.621 --> 00:16:34.956
You're persistent, like me.

239
00:16:50.223 --> 00:16:54.016
I will look for that open door.

240
00:16:54.144 --> 00:16:57.687
Just like you said, doc.

241
00:17:11.828 --> 00:17:18.166
Oh, by the way, the third
step on those stairs,


242
00:17:18.251 --> 00:17:20.200
it squeaks.

243
00:17:20.295 --> 00:17:23.170
Used to be on my to-do
list and I guess now


244
00:17:23.256 --> 00:17:25.547
it's on your to-do list.

245
00:17:25.675 --> 00:17:28.301
Yeah,
I'll get on that.


246
00:17:28.386 --> 00:17:32.379
Forgive me for the intrusion.

247
00:17:32.473 --> 00:17:33.473
It's okay.

248
00:17:33.558 --> 00:17:34.640
Yeah, good night.

249
00:17:34.726 --> 00:17:36.475
Good night.
Good night.


250
00:17:42.275 --> 00:17:44.817
Well, that was a fun night in.

251
00:17:44.903 --> 00:17:46.894
Mitch, he's lost.

252
00:17:46.988 --> 00:17:48.229
I feel bad for him.

253
00:17:48.323 --> 00:17:51.949
Yeah, well,
we're finally not lost.


254
00:17:52.035 --> 00:17:53.734
Okay, we have a home.

255
00:17:53.828 --> 00:17:58.164
So, I feel bad for
him, I wish him well,


256
00:17:58.249 --> 00:18:01.742
but can we just
settle into our lives


257
00:18:01.836 --> 00:18:04.837
and not worry about
everyone else's?


258
00:18:04.923 --> 00:18:06.214
Okay?

259
00:18:06.299 --> 00:18:09.008
Okay.

260
00:18:09.093 --> 00:18:13.254
I'm sorry.

261
00:18:13.348 --> 00:18:15.681
Okay.

262
00:18:31.908 --> 00:18:33.991
There was
something in his eyes.


263
00:18:34.077 --> 00:18:36.827
He's really hurting, Mitch.

264
00:18:36.913 --> 00:18:38.779
It's a shame.

265
00:18:38.873 --> 00:18:40.559
I just hate being
the reason why another


266
00:18:40.583 --> 00:18:42.041
person is so sad.

267
00:18:42.126 --> 00:18:43.292
We're
not the reason!


268
00:18:43.419 --> 00:18:46.287
In school we
learned about depression


269
00:18:46.381 --> 00:18:50.174
and ways it can lead to
sociopathic behavior.


270
00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.060
You talk to him
for all of five minutes


271
00:18:52.095 --> 00:18:54.387
and he's a depressed sociopath?

272
00:18:54.472 --> 00:18:57.515
No, I'm just
saying he believes


273
00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.934
we stole his house.

274
00:19:00.019 --> 00:19:01.811
We don't know this man.

275
00:19:01.938 --> 00:19:04.689
Or what he's capable of.

276
00:19:04.774 --> 00:19:12.029
Yeah, well, I know
what I'm capable of.


277
00:19:12.115 --> 00:19:14.782
Wow.

278
00:19:14.867 --> 00:19:15.867
Really?

279
00:19:15.952 --> 00:19:18.819
Do these cheesy lines
work on your wife?


280
00:19:18.913 --> 00:19:20.037
All the time.

281
00:19:20.123 --> 00:19:21.831
All the time.

282
00:20:25.146 --> 00:20:26.270
I won't let them

283
00:20:26.356 --> 00:20:27.938
take you away from me.

284
00:22:18.259 --> 00:22:20.676
It's so much better
doing it in your own house.


285
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:23.699
Maybe because
we don't have to worry


286
00:22:23.723 --> 00:22:25.923
about the neighbors hearing?

287
00:22:26.017 --> 00:22:29.727
I think
it's the space.


288
00:22:29.812 --> 00:22:34.064
Now I have enough room for
all of my sweet moves.


289
00:22:35.443 --> 00:22:36.443
Gah.

290
00:22:38.404 --> 00:22:42.531
Oh hey, I'm going
to be home late tomorrow.


291
00:22:42.617 --> 00:22:44.492
I'm putting in some OT.

292
00:22:44.577 --> 00:22:47.036
I've had a mortgage all
of one day and I already


293
00:22:47.121 --> 00:22:48.954
know why my dad had ulcers.

294
00:22:49.081 --> 00:22:52.374
I will be busy
putting finishing touches


295
00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.919
on the home office,
getting ready for


296
00:22:55.004 --> 00:22:59.715
my very first client
in my very own office.


297
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.218
Ooh, you're
going to be great.


298
00:23:02.303 --> 00:23:04.261
And the office looks great.

299
00:23:04.347 --> 00:23:06.129
I'm really proud of you, babe.

300
00:23:06.224 --> 00:23:11.810
Well, I can't have
my husband getting ulcers.


301
00:23:11.938 --> 00:23:14.480
Not until we have a
daughter or two, that is.


302
00:23:14.607 --> 00:23:16.273
All right.

303
00:23:16.359 --> 00:23:19.235
Good night.

304
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.112
Hey, just be home
by 8:00 tomorrow, okay?


305
00:23:22.198 --> 00:23:27.785
I will be cooking us our
very first home-cooked meal.


306
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:32.706
Home-cooked right
here in our home.


307
00:23:32.792 --> 00:23:35.325
You know, most
people would find that


308
00:23:35.419 --> 00:23:38.295
whole repeating the
word home thing


309
00:23:38.381 --> 00:23:40.172
over and over again annoying.

310
00:23:40.299 --> 00:23:42.299
But not this guy,
I actually enjoy it.


311
00:23:42.385 --> 00:23:43.425
Bring it on.

312
00:23:43.636 --> 00:23:46.220
Oh, okay, I was
thinking about making


313
00:23:46.305 --> 00:23:50.841
steak and home fries, maybe.

314
00:23:50.935 --> 00:23:53.018
One more.

315
00:23:53.145 --> 00:23:55.437
We can
invite our homies.


316
00:23:55.523 --> 00:23:56.689
That's the one.

317
00:23:56.816 --> 00:23:57.816
There we go.

318
00:23:57.858 --> 00:23:58.941
Thank you.

319
00:23:59.026 --> 00:23:59.817
You're welcome.

320
00:23:59.902 --> 00:24:01.777
Good night.
Night.


321
00:28:29.421 --> 00:28:31.088
Huh.

322
00:28:37.763 --> 00:28:39.137
Hey, this is
Mitch Bordine.


323
00:28:39.265 --> 00:28:40.450
Please leave a message
and I'll get back


324
00:28:40.474 --> 00:28:41.798
to you as soon as I can.

325
00:28:41.892 --> 00:28:43.100
Hey, babe.

326
00:28:43.185 --> 00:28:45.686
You put the porch
swing back up, huh?


327
00:28:45.771 --> 00:28:47.020
I like it.

328
00:28:47.106 --> 00:28:49.189
Be nice to sit out
here one day and watch


329
00:28:49.275 --> 00:28:52.818
our four children
frolicking on the lawn.


330
00:28:52.945 --> 00:28:55.112
I had to, I'm sorry.

331
00:28:55.197 --> 00:28:56.613
Couldn't resist.

332
00:28:56.699 --> 00:28:58.073
I love you.

333
00:29:10.671 --> 00:29:13.505
It was a great first night.

334
00:29:13.632 --> 00:29:19.136
Well, he's, he's handling it.

335
00:29:19.221 --> 00:29:21.513
You know Mitch, he
tries to be cool


336
00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.726
but I can sense
when he's anxious.


337
00:29:25.811 --> 00:29:30.397
We're enjoying just the
two of us for now, Mom.


338
00:29:30.482 --> 00:29:33.066
Yes, for now.

339
00:29:33.152 --> 00:29:37.029
For now is as long
as I want it to be.


340
00:29:37.156 --> 00:29:39.189
I swear, if you
bring up grandkids


341
00:29:39.283 --> 00:29:41.524
once this weekend...

342
00:29:41.619 --> 00:29:43.410
Mom!

343
00:29:43.495 --> 00:29:46.529
My house, my rules.

344
00:29:46.624 --> 00:29:49.699
Yeah, it does actually feel
pretty good to say that.


345
00:29:49.793 --> 00:29:51.113
Now I know why you
and Dad said it


346
00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:52.753
every time you had the chance.

347
00:29:54.882 --> 00:29:56.340
I'm in the kitchen.

348
00:29:56.425 --> 00:29:58.050
I'll send you a video.

349
00:29:58.177 --> 00:29:59.376
I love you too.

350
00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:01.887
See you Saturday.

351
00:30:26.121 --> 00:30:27.746
Tori: Oh, thank goodness!

352
00:30:27.873 --> 00:30:29.706
You were anxious
about the GPS again.


353
00:30:29.792 --> 00:30:31.408
Tori: Yeah, you
can't trust them.


354
00:30:31.502 --> 00:30:32.979
I have nightmares all
of the time I'm going


355
00:30:33.003 --> 00:30:35.170
to drop the kids off at
the wrong babysitter.


356
00:30:35.255 --> 00:30:36.713
Would you like
to come inside?


357
00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:38.382
Tori: Sure.

358
00:30:38.467 --> 00:30:41.343
So, how do you
like the new office?


359
00:30:41.428 --> 00:30:44.221
Tori: It's nice.

360
00:30:44.306 --> 00:30:47.432
I'm the one who
fought for this new house.


361
00:30:47.559 --> 00:30:50.143
I can already see my
husband stressing about it.


362
00:30:50.229 --> 00:30:52.429
And every time he does,
I have to fight


363
00:30:52.523 --> 00:30:54.064
the guilt away.

364
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:55.357
Tori: How do you do it?

365
00:30:55.442 --> 00:30:58.610
Well, I try to keep
in mind that every person


366
00:30:58.737 --> 00:31:00.270
is free to make
their own decisions


367
00:31:00.364 --> 00:31:04.366
and I am not
responsible for them.


368
00:31:04.451 --> 00:31:06.609
Tori: Does it work?

369
00:31:06.704 --> 00:31:08.662
Sometimes.

370
00:31:08.747 --> 00:31:11.915
The thing about emotion, Tori,

371
00:31:12.001 --> 00:31:16.962
is that it feels real
because it's here.


372
00:31:17.089 --> 00:31:19.840
Our brain knows that
the emotion is false,


373
00:31:19.925 --> 00:31:22.759
but our body refuses to listen.

374
00:31:22.845 --> 00:31:25.012
Which is why we let
the feeling happen,


375
00:31:25.097 --> 00:31:28.140
we let it wash over us,
we let it run through us.


376
00:31:28.267 --> 00:31:32.602
And, when it's done, we let
the brain take back over.


377
00:31:32.688 --> 00:31:37.399
The last thing we do is let
the emotion take control.


378
00:31:37.484 --> 00:31:39.693
Tori: Sounds really hard.

379
00:31:39.778 --> 00:31:42.812
It is a fight
every day, Tori.


380
00:31:42.906 --> 00:31:45.615
Would you like to work
on some exercises?


381
00:31:48.037 --> 00:31:51.163
All right, let's
breathe in for five.


382
00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:57.919
In, one, two, three, four, five.

383
00:31:58.005 --> 00:32:03.842
Hold, and out, two,
three, four, five.


384
00:32:03.969 --> 00:32:05.093
Good job.

385
00:32:07.014 --> 00:32:08.722
We let it do whatever
it's going to do


386
00:32:08.807 --> 00:32:13.101
and then we assert our control.

387
00:32:13.187 --> 00:32:14.677
Tori: You really
feel guilty about


388
00:32:14.772 --> 00:32:17.105
this whole husband thing, huh?

389
00:32:17.191 --> 00:32:19.682
You're deflecting.

390
00:32:19.777 --> 00:32:22.069
This isn't about
my husband, Tori.


391
00:32:22.154 --> 00:32:24.696
It's about to be.

392
00:32:28.035 --> 00:32:29.826
I'll see
you on Tuesday.


393
00:32:29.912 --> 00:32:31.361
Night!

394
00:32:31.455 --> 00:32:32.662
Tori: Bye.

395
00:32:42.841 --> 00:32:46.134
Okay, where
were we?


396
00:33:53.328 --> 00:33:54.777
No!

397
00:33:54.872 --> 00:33:56.621
No!

398
00:33:56.748 --> 00:34:00.333
No, no!

399
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:21.230
Hey, babe.

400
00:34:21.356 --> 00:34:23.056
You put the porch
swing back up, huh?


401
00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:24.150
I like it.

402
00:34:24.233 --> 00:34:25.669
Be nice to sit out here
one day and watch our


403
00:34:25.693 --> 00:34:28.653
four children
frolicking on the lawn.


404
00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:30.238
I love you.

405
00:34:35.037 --> 00:34:36.369
Hi, this is Erica Bodine.

406
00:34:36.454 --> 00:34:37.662
Leave a message.

407
00:34:37.748 --> 00:34:39.739
What's going
on there, baby-baby?


408
00:34:39.833 --> 00:34:43.793
I'm just calling to wish
you good luck today.


409
00:34:43.878 --> 00:34:46.796
Also, I don't know
what you're talking


410
00:34:46.882 --> 00:34:48.423
about with the swing.

411
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:50.250
It was down when I left.

412
00:34:50.344 --> 00:34:52.302
I think.

413
00:34:52.387 --> 00:34:53.427
I honestly don't remember.

414
00:34:53.472 --> 00:34:55.755
If this is your way of
telling me you want


415
00:34:55.849 --> 00:34:57.924
it back up, I'm okay with that.

416
00:34:58.018 --> 00:35:00.185
I kind of like the idea
of us sitting there


417
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:04.231
waiting for the
nursing home to call.


418
00:35:05.692 --> 00:35:09.819
Okay, I will see you
when I get home.


419
00:35:09.905 --> 00:35:12.105
I love you.

420
00:35:12.199 --> 00:35:14.157
Okay, bye.

421
00:35:38.892 --> 00:35:40.012
I didn't think you were going

422
00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:41.060
to struggle so much.

423
00:35:41.186 --> 00:35:42.769
I mean, I don't know
why I thought that,


424
00:35:42.854 --> 00:35:46.139
but of course, of course
you would struggle.


425
00:35:46.233 --> 00:35:47.307
Of course.

426
00:35:47.401 --> 00:35:48.775
Mr. Stenza?

427
00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.944
Everybody's calling me that now.

428
00:35:51.029 --> 00:35:54.314
I can call you
whatever you want.


429
00:35:54.408 --> 00:35:58.451
Thank you for
being so accommodating.


430
00:35:58.537 --> 00:36:01.496
I just want to
know what you want.


431
00:36:01.623 --> 00:36:03.999
What I want?

432
00:36:04.126 --> 00:36:08.795
I thought I was perfectly
clear of what I wanted.


433
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:16.803
I wanted my life back!
I wanted my life back!


434
00:36:16.888 --> 00:36:21.182
Didn't I ask you?

435
00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:25.687
Didn't I beg you
the very same thing?


436
00:36:25.814 --> 00:36:27.397
Didn't I?

437
00:36:27.482 --> 00:36:29.441
Yes.

438
00:36:29.526 --> 00:36:32.685
Didn't I tell
you that I would pay


439
00:36:32.779 --> 00:36:34.779
to get my life back?

440
00:36:34.865 --> 00:36:36.448
And then what did you guys say?

441
00:36:36.533 --> 00:36:37.533
What did you say?

442
00:36:37.659 --> 00:36:39.359
You said, go to hell!

443
00:36:39.453 --> 00:36:41.286
No, no,
we didn't say that.


444
00:36:41.371 --> 00:36:45.865
You made me do this!

445
00:36:48.879 --> 00:36:51.296
I did it, I really did it.

446
00:36:51.381 --> 00:36:52.872
What?

447
00:36:52.966 --> 00:36:54.707
Did what?

448
00:36:54.801 --> 00:36:57.344
I took you.

449
00:36:57.429 --> 00:37:00.472
This is bigger than
the both of us now.


450
00:37:00.557 --> 00:37:03.549
And now that it's started,
I can't go back.


451
00:37:03.643 --> 00:37:05.477
No, of course
you can.


452
00:37:05.562 --> 00:37:06.644
Of course you can!

453
00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:09.439
I am not going to tell
anybody that this happened.


454
00:37:09.524 --> 00:37:12.484
We can, we can start from
the beginning and we can,


455
00:37:12.569 --> 00:37:16.946
we can work together
to get your life back.


456
00:37:17.032 --> 00:37:22.452
Just untie me and,
and open that door,


457
00:37:22.537 --> 00:37:25.163
and then we can go out
there and we can just talk.


458
00:37:35.342 --> 00:37:37.759
You think that I'm one of those

459
00:37:37.886 --> 00:37:41.254
nut jobs that you
work with, don't you?


460
00:37:41.348 --> 00:37:43.056
Don't you?

461
00:37:43.141 --> 00:37:44.827
Well, let me tell you
something, young lady,


462
00:37:44.851 --> 00:37:46.426
I am a model citizen.

463
00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.728
I paid my taxes, my head
is screwed on straight,


464
00:37:48.814 --> 00:37:53.024
and this is my home!

465
00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:55.101
We need to talk.

466
00:37:57.572 --> 00:37:58.771
No more talking!

467
00:37:58.865 --> 00:37:59.772
We can talk
about anything,


468
00:37:59.866 --> 00:38:00.990
anything you want!

469
00:38:01.076 --> 00:38:04.285
We can talk and, and
we make it better.


470
00:38:04.413 --> 00:38:06.913
No.

471
00:38:06.998 --> 00:38:11.709
I don't want this
for you, Mr. Stenza.


472
00:38:11.795 --> 00:38:13.670
I'm sure your family wouldn't

473
00:38:13.755 --> 00:38:16.005
want this for you, either.

474
00:38:21.138 --> 00:38:25.974
What do you
know about my family?


475
00:38:26.101 --> 00:38:29.769
I'm sure
that they love you.


476
00:38:33.358 --> 00:38:36.943
You don't talk about my family.

477
00:38:37.028 --> 00:38:38.528
You started this.

478
00:38:38.613 --> 00:38:40.447
When you start something,
you see it all


479
00:38:40.532 --> 00:38:42.157
the way to the end.

480
00:38:42.284 --> 00:38:44.451
You understand that, missy?

481
00:38:48.957 --> 00:38:51.082
I'm going to take
everything away from you.


482
00:38:51.168 --> 00:38:55.828
I am going to do to you
what you did to me.


483
00:38:55.922 --> 00:38:58.006
I didn't do
anything to you.


484
00:38:58.133 --> 00:38:59.966
I'm taking everything away,

485
00:39:00.051 --> 00:39:01.593
piece by piece.

486
00:39:04.055 --> 00:39:06.681
First...

487
00:39:06.808 --> 00:39:09.225
a little phone call.

488
00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.514
And then I'm texting your hubby.

489
00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.092
Oh, hey, Ms. Moran.

490
00:39:43.178 --> 00:39:44.427
I'm glad you stopped by.

491
00:39:44.513 --> 00:39:45.678
I was checking the numbers...

492
00:39:45.764 --> 00:39:46.971
Mitch.

493
00:39:47.057 --> 00:39:48.765
There's a police officer
waiting for you


494
00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:51.017
in the conference room.

495
00:39:51.102 --> 00:39:54.103
Oh, is
everything all right?


496
00:39:54.189 --> 00:39:57.482
He was polite,
no sense of urgency.


497
00:39:57.567 --> 00:40:01.561
But, Mitch, I really don't
appreciate my employees'


498
00:40:01.655 --> 00:40:04.614
private lives walking into
my business requesting


499
00:40:04.699 --> 00:40:09.661
a private room to ask
a few questions.


500
00:40:09.746 --> 00:40:12.539
Straighten it out.

501
00:40:12.624 --> 00:40:14.207
Yeah, yes.

502
00:40:14.292 --> 00:40:17.502
I'll, I'll get on that.

503
00:40:17.587 --> 00:40:20.171
Umm, sorry.

504
00:40:34.729 --> 00:40:36.187
Thank you.

505
00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:46.114
You want to take a seat, Mitch?

506
00:40:46.241 --> 00:40:48.908
Um...

507
00:40:48.994 --> 00:40:50.535
is there a problem?

508
00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:54.038
That's what we're
going to find out.


509
00:40:54.124 --> 00:40:57.950
You know, when a cop
asks you if you want


510
00:40:58.044 --> 00:41:02.839
to take a seat, he's
not really asking.


511
00:41:21.735 --> 00:41:25.194
You know how to work
a tablet, Mitch?


512
00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.113
Yeah.

513
00:41:27.198 --> 00:41:31.743
Great, unlock
that bad boy and take


514
00:41:31.828 --> 00:41:34.662
a gander at the first
picture, will you?


515
00:41:34.789 --> 00:41:36.956
I would do it myself,
but, you know,


516
00:41:37.042 --> 00:41:40.710
sticky fingers.

517
00:41:40.795 --> 00:41:43.838
Ah, code?

518
00:41:43.965 --> 00:41:45.089
Oh, right.

519
00:41:45.175 --> 00:41:48.134
It's one...

520
00:41:48.219 --> 00:41:50.094
two...

521
00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.680
three-four-five.

522
00:41:52.807 --> 00:41:54.766
Not a great code, I know,
but it's the only one


523
00:41:54.851 --> 00:41:56.643
I can remember.

524
00:41:56.728 --> 00:41:59.103
Besides, anyone who
steals a cop's tablet


525
00:41:59.189 --> 00:42:01.689
has got to be too dumb
to guess it, right?


526
00:42:05.028 --> 00:42:06.819
You know that guy?

527
00:42:06.905 --> 00:42:10.156
Yeah, I bid on
our house from him.


528
00:42:10.241 --> 00:42:13.868
Sorry, I don't
remember his name.


529
00:42:13.995 --> 00:42:16.362
Sims.

530
00:42:16.456 --> 00:42:20.208
Jonathan Michael Sims.

531
00:42:20.335 --> 00:42:22.293
Okay, do you
want to tell me


532
00:42:22.379 --> 00:42:24.704
what this is all about?

533
00:42:24.798 --> 00:42:30.593
You know, it's never
as easy as I'd like to be.


534
00:42:30.679 --> 00:42:34.055
Okay, here's what
we're going to do...


535
00:42:34.182 --> 00:42:35.622
you and me are just
going to sit here


536
00:42:35.684 --> 00:42:39.552
for a little bit like
a couple of old pals.


537
00:42:39.646 --> 00:42:42.271
After all, if it
turns out I'm wrong,


538
00:42:42.357 --> 00:42:46.401
I'd like you to
still have a job.


539
00:42:46.528 --> 00:42:51.447
I'm sorry, are you
arresting me for something?


540
00:42:51.533 --> 00:42:53.199
Mitch,
Mitch, come on.


541
00:42:53.284 --> 00:42:56.285
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.


542
00:42:56.371 --> 00:42:59.747
I mean, unless you want
to confess something.


543
00:42:59.874 --> 00:43:02.417
Confess to what?

544
00:43:02.544 --> 00:43:08.172
Mr. Sims died the
night you won your house.


545
00:43:08.258 --> 00:43:10.091
Hit and run.

546
00:43:10.218 --> 00:43:12.802
That,
that's terrible.


547
00:43:12.887 --> 00:43:15.346
Yeah.

548
00:43:15.432 --> 00:43:18.808
You drive a Dodge, right?

549
00:43:18.893 --> 00:43:20.426
Yeah.

550
00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.688
Stratus, blue, right?

551
00:43:23.773 --> 00:43:25.815
Yes!

552
00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:31.154
Well, there
was a fabric sample


553
00:43:31.239 --> 00:43:33.823
in the grill of your car...

554
00:43:33.908 --> 00:43:38.369
that at least on the
eyeball test seems to be


555
00:43:38.455 --> 00:43:41.113
from the shirt he was
wearing that night.


556
00:43:41.207 --> 00:43:42.207
Wait, wait, wait.

557
00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:46.377
You, you searched my car?

558
00:43:46.463 --> 00:43:48.504
Well...

559
00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:50.840
it's in the parking lot.

560
00:43:50.925 --> 00:43:52.625
Public property.

561
00:43:52.719 --> 00:43:54.218
And we didn't have to search it,

562
00:43:54.304 --> 00:43:58.264
the fabric was there
flapping in the breeze


563
00:43:58.349 --> 00:43:59.349
for all to see.

564
00:43:59.434 --> 00:44:02.727
Not really smart, if you ask me.

565
00:44:02.812 --> 00:44:05.980
So, you tell me.

566
00:44:06.107 --> 00:44:08.566
If you were a cop...

567
00:44:08.651 --> 00:44:11.778
would you be suspicious?

568
00:44:11.863 --> 00:44:13.654
Well, I don't
know what's going on,


569
00:44:13.782 --> 00:44:15.948
because I didn't do anything.

570
00:44:16.034 --> 00:44:17.553
You know, the problem
with you saying that,


571
00:44:17.577 --> 00:44:20.912
Mitch, is that's exactly
what somebody who did


572
00:44:20.997 --> 00:44:23.372
do something would say.

573
00:44:23.458 --> 00:44:27.502
So, look...

574
00:44:27.629 --> 00:44:32.423
let's just you and me
wait here until the lab


575
00:44:32.509 --> 00:44:37.762
calls me about that
little swatch of fabric.


576
00:44:37.847 --> 00:44:39.847
Sound good?

577
00:44:39.974 --> 00:44:42.475
Excellent.

578
00:45:32.902 --> 00:45:34.068
Damn it!

579
00:45:50.378 --> 00:45:52.244
Must have felt pretty good,

580
00:45:52.338 --> 00:45:55.840
walking around your
old house again.


581
00:45:55.925 --> 00:45:58.885
Yeah.

582
00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:01.220
It was wonderful, even with
all that tacky furniture


583
00:46:01.306 --> 00:46:03.097
you guys put inside there.

584
00:46:03.224 --> 00:46:08.144
But all those wonderful
memories are still there.


585
00:46:08.229 --> 00:46:12.431
Mr. Stenza,
what's next?


586
00:46:12.525 --> 00:46:15.526
I told you, I want your husband

587
00:46:15.612 --> 00:46:18.404
to feel like I do.

588
00:46:18.489 --> 00:46:20.197
That's why he's being
arrested right now


589
00:46:20.283 --> 00:46:21.824
for a hit and run.

590
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:23.200
What?!

591
00:46:23.286 --> 00:46:24.493
He will lose his job,

592
00:46:24.579 --> 00:46:26.946
he'll have a conviction
on his record.


593
00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.400
And whenever he gets
out of prison,


594
00:46:28.458 --> 00:46:30.666
whenever that's going to be,

595
00:46:30.752 --> 00:46:34.253
well, he will be unemployable.

596
00:46:34.339 --> 00:46:36.047
You know, you take
everything away


597
00:46:36.132 --> 00:46:39.467
from a man, you take
away his livelihood.


598
00:46:39.594 --> 00:46:43.012
And that's going to happen
to Mitch soon enough.


599
00:46:43.097 --> 00:46:45.932
I'm trying to
help you, Mr. Stenza.


600
00:46:46.017 --> 00:46:49.435
When you threaten me,
I get scared


601
00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.438
and that doesn't further
either of our goals.


602
00:46:52.523 --> 00:46:54.106
I wouldn't
really know about that,


603
00:46:54.192 --> 00:46:56.308
because right now I'm
feeling pretty good.


604
00:46:56.402 --> 00:46:58.486
Well, if it's
threats you like,


605
00:46:58.613 --> 00:47:00.863
then let me tell you
this right now:


606
00:47:00.949 --> 00:47:04.533
if you hurt my husband,
I will do whatever


607
00:47:04.619 --> 00:47:06.986
it takes to cut you into pieces!

608
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.871
Do you understand me?

609
00:47:08.957 --> 00:47:11.540
Wow!

610
00:47:11.626 --> 00:47:14.493
You've got fight in you.

611
00:47:14.587 --> 00:47:17.672
Untie me and
I'll show you how much.


612
00:47:20.969 --> 00:47:22.426
Hey, you remind me...

613
00:47:22.512 --> 00:47:24.303
I don't care
who I remind you of!


614
00:47:24.389 --> 00:47:26.931
Let me out of here!

615
00:47:27.016 --> 00:47:29.892
No.

616
00:47:33.398 --> 00:47:37.483
I built this room
for my son, Max.


617
00:47:37.568 --> 00:47:39.735
He loved it here.

618
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:42.021
This was his playroom.

619
00:47:42.115 --> 00:47:44.365
Daddy, you want to go
play games down there?


620
00:47:44.492 --> 00:47:47.192
It's my favorite room, Daddy.

621
00:47:47.286 --> 00:47:50.863
I love my safe
place room, Daddy.


622
00:47:50.957 --> 00:47:52.498
Oh, I see.

623
00:47:52.583 --> 00:47:53.874
Now you're all clammed up.

624
00:47:54.002 --> 00:47:55.145
Before, you were Chatty Cathy,

625
00:47:55.169 --> 00:47:57.378
trying to get me to
talk all the time,


626
00:47:57.505 --> 00:48:00.464
and now you're all
boarded up, huh?


627
00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:03.676
Like a virgin on prom night.

628
00:48:03.761 --> 00:48:06.470
Let me go.

629
00:48:06.556 --> 00:48:08.264
No.

630
00:48:15.606 --> 00:48:18.774
My son, he loved to play games.

631
00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:22.061
He couldn't say pick-up truck.

632
00:48:22.155 --> 00:48:25.740
So we'd play the
game hiccup twuck.


633
00:48:25.867 --> 00:48:29.660
I'd put the truck right here.

634
00:48:29.746 --> 00:48:32.246
In the middle of
the room on the rug.


635
00:48:32.373 --> 00:48:34.040
And then I would count to three:

636
00:48:34.125 --> 00:48:37.043
one, two, three.

637
00:48:37.128 --> 00:48:40.004
And whoever could grab
it first, would win.


638
00:48:40.089 --> 00:48:41.089
Daddy, I won.

639
00:48:41.132 --> 00:48:43.132
I won, Daddy!

640
00:48:43.217 --> 00:48:45.918
He was a champ.

641
00:48:46.012 --> 00:48:48.929
I never won.

642
00:48:49.057 --> 00:48:52.091
You sound like
you're a good father.


643
00:48:52.185 --> 00:48:54.560
Yeah.

644
00:48:54.645 --> 00:48:58.314
You know, my son, he had
a lot of fight in him.


645
00:48:58.399 --> 00:49:01.108
A lot of fight!

646
00:49:01.235 --> 00:49:04.653
And I had to tell him
that when he was


647
00:49:04.739 --> 00:49:07.740
in the hospital.

648
00:49:07.825 --> 00:49:10.201
You keep fighting, son.

649
00:49:10.286 --> 00:49:14.288
You make strong, you
keep fighting, son!


650
00:49:14.415 --> 00:49:15.581
I will, Daddy.

651
00:49:15.666 --> 00:49:18.584
I will keep fighting, Daddy.

652
00:49:18.669 --> 00:49:23.798
That had to be
so hard for you.


653
00:49:23.925 --> 00:49:26.717
You'll never know.

654
00:49:26.803 --> 00:49:29.595
But I can see
the pain you're in.


655
00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:33.224
He was six years old.

656
00:49:33.309 --> 00:49:36.769
He was six years old!

657
00:49:40.191 --> 00:49:43.818
So, what would you know
about pain like that, huh?


658
00:49:43.945 --> 00:49:47.363
I know that talking
about it can help.


659
00:49:47.448 --> 00:49:50.699
Do you want to talk about it?

660
00:50:01.295 --> 00:50:02.661
No, no, Theodore, please.

661
00:50:02.755 --> 00:50:04.046
Please!

662
00:50:06.592 --> 00:50:08.551
Who is that?

663
00:50:08.636 --> 00:50:12.179
It's Dan, it's
one of my patients.


664
00:50:12.306 --> 00:50:14.390
He's on the schedule.

665
00:50:14.475 --> 00:50:16.008
If you say anything,

666
00:50:16.102 --> 00:50:18.435
this adventure ends
for all of us.


667
00:50:18.521 --> 00:50:20.062
You understand?

668
00:50:24.068 --> 00:50:25.068
Dan, hi!

669
00:50:25.153 --> 00:50:26.527
Dan: Dr. Bordine,
hey, I'm here.


670
00:50:26.654 --> 00:50:27.862
I didn't want to knock because,

671
00:50:27.989 --> 00:50:29.155
you know, the thing.

672
00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:32.357
Dan, I'm sorry,
I need to cancel today.


673
00:50:32.451 --> 00:50:35.244
Dan: Sorry, that's not
going to work for me.


674
00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:37.696
Dan, I'm sick.

675
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:41.292
Dan: So am I,
that's why I'm here.


676
00:50:41.377 --> 00:50:42.377
You know I can't have...

677
00:50:43.838 --> 00:50:45.238
You shouldn't
have done that.


678
00:50:45.298 --> 00:50:47.298
Dan has extreme OCD,
he has a method


679
00:50:47.383 --> 00:50:49.842
for ending phone calls.

680
00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:58.100
No, no, stop, no!

681
00:50:58.186 --> 00:51:00.019
Stop it, no, no!

682
00:51:02.064 --> 00:51:03.147
No!

683
00:51:45.274 --> 00:51:46.815
Dan: Who are you?

684
00:51:46.901 --> 00:51:48.275
Sorry, appointment cancelled

685
00:51:48.402 --> 00:51:49.768
for today.

686
00:51:49.862 --> 00:51:51.987
Dan: Wait, no, see, because
she didn't call me.


687
00:51:52.073 --> 00:51:53.155
She's sick.

688
00:51:53.241 --> 00:51:54.676
Dan: But she said she
was going to call me


689
00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:55.820
if she ever needed to cancel.

690
00:51:55.868 --> 00:51:57.943
For whatever reason,
see, that was our deal.


691
00:51:58.037 --> 00:52:00.204
You know,
sometimes life throws you


692
00:52:00.289 --> 00:52:01.580
curveballs, buddy.

693
00:52:01.666 --> 00:52:03.282
Dan: See, that's the thing.

694
00:52:03.376 --> 00:52:05.617
I live my life in ways so
I don't get curve balls.


695
00:52:05.711 --> 00:52:07.378
It's not a choice, you know?

696
00:52:07.463 --> 00:52:08.504
Listen...

697
00:52:08.589 --> 00:52:09.880
Dan: Who are you,
again, anyway?


698
00:52:09.966 --> 00:52:10.966
Where is Erica?

699
00:52:11.092 --> 00:52:11.957
I'm her husband and I'm taking

700
00:52:12.051 --> 00:52:13.425
care of her, okay?

701
00:52:13.511 --> 00:52:16.011
Dan: You're Mitch Bordine?

702
00:52:16.097 --> 00:52:17.471
That is correct.

703
00:52:17.598 --> 00:52:19.464
Dan: You're not him.

704
00:52:19.558 --> 00:52:21.141
I am.

705
00:52:21.269 --> 00:52:24.636
Dan: The photo of Erica and
her husband of three months,


706
00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:26.480
Mitch, on her website
says otherwise.


707
00:52:26.607 --> 00:52:27.751
What the hell is going on here?

708
00:52:27.775 --> 00:52:29.358
I want to talk
to Dr. Bordine!


709
00:52:29.443 --> 00:52:31.235
Ooh!

710
00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:35.281
No, no, no!

711
00:53:20.077 --> 00:53:25.664
Sorry, my wife
hasn't texted me back.


712
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:27.791
Marital troubles?

713
00:53:27.918 --> 00:53:30.961
No, she's
a psychologist,


714
00:53:31.088 --> 00:53:32.921
she's with patients.

715
00:53:33.007 --> 00:53:36.300
Are you one of
her patients, Mitch?


716
00:53:36.427 --> 00:53:37.529
Is everything
I say to you going


717
00:53:37.553 --> 00:53:39.636
to be something you
find suspicious?


718
00:53:39.764 --> 00:53:41.513
Should it be?

719
00:53:44.935 --> 00:53:48.804
Well, I guess we're
about to find out.


720
00:53:48.898 --> 00:53:49.898
Go for Ivie.

721
00:53:53.861 --> 00:53:55.569
Mm-hmm.

722
00:53:55.654 --> 00:53:56.820
Okay, thank you.

723
00:53:56.947 --> 00:53:59.531
Yeah, bye.

724
00:53:59.617 --> 00:54:03.660
Mitch, looks like you
and I have two choices.


725
00:54:03.788 --> 00:54:07.998
The first one is I escort
you to the parking lot


726
00:54:08.125 --> 00:54:09.458
and put cuffs on there.

727
00:54:09.543 --> 00:54:14.380
The second choice is
way less pleasant


728
00:54:14.465 --> 00:54:17.508
and far more embarrassing.

729
00:54:17.635 --> 00:54:22.012
So, you,
you're arresting me.


730
00:54:22.139 --> 00:54:25.182
The samples
matched, Mitch.


731
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:27.393
Well, it has
to be planted,


732
00:54:27.478 --> 00:54:29.561
because I didn't hit anybody.

733
00:54:29.647 --> 00:54:31.939
You know, you're
starting to sound


734
00:54:32.024 --> 00:54:35.484
like a guy who is hell
bent on option B.


735
00:54:35.569 --> 00:54:37.861
You really want
everyone in this office


736
00:54:37.988 --> 00:54:41.073
to see me restrain
and put cuffs on you?


737
00:54:41.158 --> 00:54:42.449
I am innocent.

738
00:54:42.535 --> 00:54:44.868
That's what
court is for.


739
00:54:44.995 --> 00:54:46.703
Do I look like
someone who would


740
00:54:46.831 --> 00:54:48.372
lie to you about this?

741
00:54:48.499 --> 00:54:50.999
Do I look like
someone who cares?


742
00:54:51.085 --> 00:54:54.503
Now, you need to pull it
together, pal, right now.


743
00:54:54.588 --> 00:54:58.549
And you need to take a
little walk with me.


744
00:54:58.676 --> 00:55:01.877
Last chance.

745
00:55:01.971 --> 00:55:03.345
Let's go.

746
00:55:03.431 --> 00:55:05.764
Now.

747
00:56:31.435 --> 00:56:34.636
I'm impressed.

748
00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:37.856
You are a fighter.

749
00:56:37.942 --> 00:56:40.108
You know, my wife was a fighter.

750
00:56:40.194 --> 00:56:43.403
Yeah.

751
00:56:43.489 --> 00:56:47.074
So, the, uh...

752
00:56:47.159 --> 00:56:52.496
situation with your
patient makes me realize


753
00:56:52.623 --> 00:56:56.875
that maybe you were right.

754
00:57:09.223 --> 00:57:10.847
Yeah.

755
00:57:16.146 --> 00:57:18.313
Yeah.

756
00:57:18.399 --> 00:57:23.402
So, why don't you come on out

757
00:57:23.487 --> 00:57:30.358
and let's talk about it, huh?

758
00:57:30.452 --> 00:57:33.662
I need your help.

759
00:57:33.747 --> 00:57:35.497
It's something that
I would never ask for,


760
00:57:35.583 --> 00:57:38.959
but I'm asking you now.

761
00:57:39.044 --> 00:57:43.038
Please, come and help me.

762
00:58:07.156 --> 00:58:13.035
Please, please,
somebody help me!


763
00:58:41.565 --> 00:58:43.482
Watch your head.

764
00:58:51.325 --> 00:58:52.886
Dispatch: Say again,
we have a two-forty at


765
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:55.827
1319 Redwood Court.

766
00:58:55.913 --> 00:58:58.246
Witness saw an Asian female
in her 20s screaming


767
00:58:58.332 --> 00:59:00.582
for help and being held
against her will by a man.


768
00:59:00.668 --> 00:59:02.209
Long hair, 6'3"...

769
00:59:02.294 --> 00:59:03.294
Hey!

770
00:59:03.337 --> 00:59:04.452
Dispatch: 1319...

771
00:59:04.546 --> 00:59:05.453
Hey!

772
00:59:05.547 --> 00:59:06.547
Dispatch: Redwood.

773
00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:07.789
Calm down.

774
00:59:07.883 --> 00:59:09.069
Look, man, you want to
explain to me why you want


775
00:59:09.093 --> 00:59:10.973
to add resisting arrest
to all the other charges


776
00:59:11.053 --> 00:59:12.511
you're already facing?

777
00:59:12.596 --> 00:59:14.462
What's a two-forty?

778
00:59:14.556 --> 00:59:15.630
The radio?

779
00:59:15.724 --> 00:59:17.599
1319 Redwood, that's my house.

780
00:59:17.685 --> 00:59:19.300
They just said a
woman was screaming


781
00:59:19.395 --> 00:59:20.435
outside of my house.

782
00:59:20.521 --> 00:59:22.354
That's my wife!

783
00:59:22.439 --> 00:59:23.563
You don't know that.

784
00:59:23.649 --> 00:59:26.641
Dispatch, please repeat
the description of suspect.


785
00:59:26.735 --> 00:59:30.311
Dispatch: Long hair,

786
00:59:30.406 --> 00:59:31.780
Oh my God.

787
00:59:31.865 --> 00:59:34.825
This is him, this is all him!

788
00:59:34.952 --> 00:59:35.784
Mr. Bordine...

789
00:59:35.953 --> 00:59:37.347
Theodore Stenza,
the owner of


790
00:59:37.371 --> 00:59:38.412
the house before me.

791
00:59:38.497 --> 00:59:40.414
This has got to be him!

792
00:59:40.499 --> 00:59:43.875
Now, what is a two-forty?

793
00:59:43.961 --> 00:59:46.503
Assault.

794
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:48.213
Unit 21 responding.

795
00:59:54.888 --> 00:59:56.763
Sit down.

796
00:59:56.849 --> 00:59:58.223
Sit down!

797
01:00:03.605 --> 01:00:08.233
I knew this guy in the war,
he did a Wild West show.


798
01:00:08.318 --> 01:00:10.351
Fast draw kind of
stuff, you know?


799
01:00:10.446 --> 01:00:11.631
I bugged him every
night to teach me


800
01:00:11.655 --> 01:00:13.321
how to do that stuff.

801
01:00:13.407 --> 01:00:14.990
So I'm telling you, young lady,

802
01:00:15.075 --> 01:00:17.200
you try another trick
like you just did,


803
01:00:17.327 --> 01:00:18.910
this knife is going
to be in my hand


804
01:00:18.996 --> 01:00:20.932
and in the middle of your
chest before you can make


805
01:00:20.956 --> 01:00:22.998
two steps toward that
door over there.


806
01:00:23.083 --> 01:00:24.958
You understand me?

807
01:00:25.043 --> 01:00:27.794
Big man with
a big knife, right?


808
01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:30.547
You got me this time,

809
01:00:30.674 --> 01:00:32.966
but it ain't happening again.

810
01:00:35.637 --> 01:00:37.846
You play baseball?

811
01:00:37.931 --> 01:00:39.222
Softball?

812
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:42.225
Hoo, girl, you got a
home run swing, man.


813
01:00:42.352 --> 01:00:45.270
Got some skills, got potential.

814
01:00:49.443 --> 01:00:52.110
What would your
son say about all this?


815
01:00:52.196 --> 01:00:56.064
About the monster you've become?

816
01:00:56.158 --> 01:00:59.367
Nothing.

817
01:00:59.453 --> 01:01:02.037
Your son died,
so you get to kill


818
01:01:02.122 --> 01:01:04.080
whoever you want.

819
01:01:04.208 --> 01:01:08.960
Your wife died, so you get
to hurt and scare people.


820
01:01:09.046 --> 01:01:12.589
You lost your house, so
you can toss away right


821
01:01:12.716 --> 01:01:16.593
and wrong like a bloody towel?

822
01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.754
I'm sorry, Theodore.

823
01:01:19.848 --> 01:01:24.184
A million people deal with
things like this every day,


824
01:01:24.269 --> 01:01:27.262
and none of them
use it as an excuse.


825
01:01:27.356 --> 01:01:30.265
You and your fancy schools.

826
01:01:30.359 --> 01:01:32.442
Therapists know it all, huh?

827
01:01:32.569 --> 01:01:35.362
You're in the word business
and you can't even


828
01:01:35.447 --> 01:01:36.905
get that straight.

829
01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:39.115
All you do is talk for a living,

830
01:01:39.243 --> 01:01:40.608
talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

831
01:01:40.702 --> 01:01:42.828
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!

832
01:01:42.913 --> 01:01:46.373
Try doing something
with your hands!


833
01:01:46.458 --> 01:01:48.283
Stop it!

834
01:01:48.377 --> 01:01:51.336
You use my family
as an excuse one more time,


835
01:01:51.421 --> 01:01:53.171
you're done.

836
01:01:57.094 --> 01:01:59.010
I apologize.

837
01:02:02.516 --> 01:02:07.185
You have lost and I am
so sorry for all


838
01:02:07.271 --> 01:02:10.981
that you've been through.

839
01:02:11.108 --> 01:02:13.900
It's hell on Earth.

840
01:02:13.986 --> 01:02:17.812
And you're right, I don't
know how that feels.


841
01:02:17.906 --> 01:02:21.491
You will.

842
01:02:21.618 --> 01:02:27.080
Life reveals
who we truly are,


843
01:02:27.165 --> 01:02:31.293
eventually, and always.

844
01:02:31.378 --> 01:02:35.997
You got your house
back, Theodore.


845
01:02:36.091 --> 01:02:39.759
Just let me go and you can
get back to your life.


846
01:02:39.845 --> 01:02:41.303
My life is over.

847
01:02:41.388 --> 01:02:43.054
No one is
saying that!


848
01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:44.222
I'm saying it.

849
01:02:44.308 --> 01:02:47.809
I am saying
you've won!


850
01:02:47.895 --> 01:02:50.145
I've won?

851
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:55.358
Does this look like a
victory lap to you?


852
01:02:55.485 --> 01:02:57.068
Huh?

853
01:03:05.996 --> 01:03:09.030
My son thought I was a winner.

854
01:03:09.124 --> 01:03:12.792
You're a winner, Daddy,
just like in the movies.


855
01:03:18.592 --> 01:03:21.635
Did you watch movies
with your son, Theodore?


856
01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:24.045
All the time.

857
01:03:24.139 --> 01:03:26.014
When he was sick.

858
01:03:26.099 --> 01:03:28.516
Then tell me this...

859
01:03:28.602 --> 01:03:33.146
if Max were watching
this movie right now,


860
01:03:33.231 --> 01:03:38.726
would he think you were
the good guy or the bad guy?


861
01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:45.116
I never wanted
this to happen like this.


862
01:03:45.202 --> 01:03:47.160
I'm a good guy.

863
01:03:47.245 --> 01:03:50.121
No, no!

864
01:03:50.207 --> 01:03:55.001
Good people don't hold
others against their will!


865
01:03:55.087 --> 01:03:58.964
And they don't murder people!

866
01:03:59.049 --> 01:04:02.717
I'm a good guy, 
I'm a good guy!

867
01:04:02.803 --> 01:04:06.054
I'm a good guy.

868
01:04:06.139 --> 01:04:11.685
I'm a good guy, I'm a
good guy, I'm a good guy!


869
01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:13.895
I'm a good guy!

870
01:04:13.981 --> 01:04:16.481
Good guy, I'm a good guy!

871
01:04:22.155 --> 01:04:23.947
Sit down.

872
01:04:44.928 --> 01:04:47.262
Answer it, sell it.

873
01:04:47.347 --> 01:04:49.055
Cops, whoever it is,
tell them you're fine


874
01:04:49.141 --> 01:04:51.182
and sell it.

875
01:04:51.268 --> 01:04:53.393
Erica, hi.

876
01:04:53.478 --> 01:04:57.313
This is Detective Ivie, LAPD.

877
01:04:57.441 --> 01:05:00.400
I'm doing a wellness check.

878
01:05:02.946 --> 01:05:05.071
Over the phone?

879
01:05:05.157 --> 01:05:06.981
Well, you can't
expect us to make


880
01:05:07.075 --> 01:05:10.368
the drive out to
every house, right?


881
01:05:10.454 --> 01:05:14.247
I just need verbal confirmation.

882
01:05:14.332 --> 01:05:16.791
Are you okay?

883
01:05:16.877 --> 01:05:20.086
Yes, I'm okay.

884
01:05:20.172 --> 01:05:22.338
Do you need medical attention?

885
01:05:26.803 --> 01:05:30.138
No.

886
01:05:30.223 --> 01:05:32.557
You're not being
held against your will?


887
01:05:47.741 --> 01:05:49.690
Erica?

888
01:05:49.785 --> 01:05:55.622
No, not being
held against my will.


889
01:05:55.707 --> 01:05:57.916
Great.

890
01:05:58.001 --> 01:06:01.544
Just one more question...

891
01:06:01.671 --> 01:06:04.631
what's your
mother-in-law's name?


892
01:06:04.716 --> 01:06:06.424
Dottie.

893
01:06:06.510 --> 01:06:08.802
How's your mom?

894
01:06:08.887 --> 01:06:11.429
Sheila, I think, Mitch
said her name was.


895
01:06:15.852 --> 01:06:18.478
She's fine, officer.

896
01:06:18.563 --> 01:06:21.481
Sheila's doing just fine.

897
01:06:26.154 --> 01:06:27.737
Erica, could you
put Theodore


898
01:06:27.864 --> 01:06:29.906
on the phone, please?

899
01:06:32.953 --> 01:06:34.994
He wants
to talk to you.


900
01:06:42.879 --> 01:06:45.580
Mr. Stenza, this
is Detective Ivie


901
01:06:45.674 --> 01:06:47.151
with the Los Angeles
Police Department.


902
01:06:47.175 --> 01:06:48.925
How are we doing in there?

903
01:06:49.052 --> 01:06:50.343
We?

904
01:06:50.428 --> 01:06:51.803
Yes, we.

905
01:06:51.888 --> 01:06:54.589
We are in this together.

906
01:06:54.683 --> 01:06:56.766
We're just peachy.

907
01:06:56.893 --> 01:06:58.371
Look, I understand
that you're angry.


908
01:06:58.395 --> 01:06:59.644
I would be, too.

909
01:06:59.729 --> 01:07:01.146
I mean, you had a whole plan,

910
01:07:01.231 --> 01:07:03.606
and now that plan is sideways

911
01:07:03.733 --> 01:07:05.600
and you're feeling
like you're drowning.


912
01:07:05.694 --> 01:07:08.736
But I'm here to tell you
that you're not.


913
01:07:08.822 --> 01:07:11.105
You see, this is your
chance to just grab my hand,


914
01:07:11.199 --> 01:07:17.287
get out of the water, and
still get to live a life.


915
01:07:17.414 --> 01:07:20.623
No, there's no way out.

916
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:23.084
There's
always a way out.


917
01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:24.752
We sometimes just don't see it.

918
01:07:24.838 --> 01:07:27.338
Who the hell are
you to talk to me, huh?


919
01:07:27.424 --> 01:07:29.465
Hey, I get it, we
don't know each other.


920
01:07:29.593 --> 01:07:31.926
But I'm here to help,
nothing more than that,


921
01:07:32.012 --> 01:07:33.344
okay, Theodore?

922
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:35.013
I tried to do it the right way

923
01:07:35.098 --> 01:07:37.807
my entire life, I truly did.

924
01:07:37.934 --> 01:07:39.934
I know you did.

925
01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:43.646
And now I'm
going to do it my way.


926
01:07:43.773 --> 01:07:46.307
Look, I'm a
cop, Mr. Stenza.


927
01:07:46.401 --> 01:07:47.975
I've seen a million
of these cases.


928
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:52.739
Backup is on the way, but
you know LA traffic, right?


929
01:07:54.701 --> 01:07:56.409
What the hell
are you doing?


930
01:07:56.494 --> 01:07:58.745
Is Erica okay?

931
01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:01.822
Is my wife okay?

932
01:08:01.917 --> 01:08:03.708
So it could
be a while longer,


933
01:08:03.793 --> 01:08:05.229
but here's the thing,
they have to take


934
01:08:05.253 --> 01:08:06.377
any deal I give them.

935
01:08:06.463 --> 01:08:08.880
So, if you hurry up and
hash this out with me


936
01:08:08.965 --> 01:08:11.966
right now, I can get you
more than those bums


937
01:08:12.052 --> 01:08:14.177
would ever give you.

938
01:08:14.304 --> 01:08:16.429
I know those stalling tactics.

939
01:08:16.514 --> 01:08:17.867
You ever thought about
being a therapist,


940
01:08:17.891 --> 01:08:19.098
huh, Ivie?

941
01:08:19.184 --> 01:08:20.675
You'd have hit it
out of the park.


942
01:08:20.769 --> 01:08:24.562
A therapist doesn't
have what I have, Theodore,


943
01:08:24.648 --> 01:08:26.731
a get out of jail free card.

944
01:08:31.153 --> 01:08:32.737
I'm listening.

945
01:08:32.822 --> 01:08:34.029
So am I.

946
01:08:34.157 --> 01:08:35.198
What is it that you want?

947
01:08:35.324 --> 01:08:38.534
What do I need to give you
so that you let Erica go


948
01:08:38.662 --> 01:08:41.362
and we all walk out of
here happy and healthy?


949
01:08:41.456 --> 01:08:44.499
What is it that I want?

950
01:08:44.583 --> 01:08:45.917
Let's make it happen.

951
01:08:46.001 --> 01:08:49.462
I want my house
back, that's what I want!


952
01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:56.544
Hey, hey, done.

953
01:08:56.638 --> 01:08:59.013
Really?

954
01:08:59.099 --> 01:09:00.555
Just like that?

955
01:09:00.684 --> 01:09:02.058
My friend,
I've got Mitch


956
01:09:02.185 --> 01:09:03.309
down here in handcuffs.

957
01:09:03.394 --> 01:09:05.353
He'll sell, a good price, too.

958
01:09:05.438 --> 01:09:08.856
Is that going to do it for you?

959
01:09:14.698 --> 01:09:16.739
Let me think
about it for a moment.


960
01:09:16.866 --> 01:09:18.010
Well, don't
take too long,


961
01:09:18.034 --> 01:09:19.742
I'm worried I see
red and blue lights


962
01:09:19.868 --> 01:09:21.243
in the distance.

963
01:09:41.724 --> 01:09:43.516
Well, that was nice, Ivie.

964
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.934
What was?

965
01:09:45.061 --> 01:09:47.519
Believing that
maybe this was all real.


966
01:09:47.605 --> 01:09:48.938
It is real.

967
01:09:51.067 --> 01:09:52.233
Good-bye.

968
01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:55.194
Theodore,
do not hang up.


969
01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:16.424
What?

970
01:10:16.509 --> 01:10:18.384
What is going on?

971
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:19.885
Come on.

972
01:10:19.971 --> 01:10:21.846
Come on, let's go.

973
01:10:21.930 --> 01:10:23.848
Get up, we're moving.

974
01:10:50.418 --> 01:10:52.543
My wife loved that kitchen.

975
01:10:52.629 --> 01:10:56.214
She made the best
French toast in there.


976
01:10:56.299 --> 01:10:58.465
We moved the coffee maker
closer to the refrigerator


977
01:10:58.551 --> 01:11:01.052
because it was easier
to get to the milk.


978
01:11:01.137 --> 01:11:03.971
I can move it back.

979
01:11:04.057 --> 01:11:06.474
You shouldn't have
hung up on him.


980
01:11:06.559 --> 01:11:07.767
You keep on sounding like

981
01:11:07.852 --> 01:11:09.510
you think there's hope.

982
01:11:09.604 --> 01:11:12.063
The police
are talking to you.


983
01:11:12.148 --> 01:11:14.180
Why isn't there hope?

984
01:11:14.275 --> 01:11:17.735
Because I'm done
talking to the police.


985
01:11:17.821 --> 01:11:22.323
And I'm done talking to you.

986
01:11:22.409 --> 01:11:24.867
Dispatch, this is
unit 21 with the two-forty.


987
01:11:24.994 --> 01:11:26.911
We've got an escalating
situation here at


988
01:11:26.996 --> 01:11:28.362
1319 Redwood.

989
01:11:28.456 --> 01:11:30.832
Can I get an ETA on backup?

990
01:11:30.917 --> 01:11:33.534
No, stop,
Theodore, stop!


991
01:11:33.628 --> 01:11:34.961
Theodore, stop!

992
01:11:35.046 --> 01:11:36.046
No!

993
01:11:36.171 --> 01:11:37.171
Please!

994
01:11:39.342 --> 01:11:40.508
Hey, hey, hey!

995
01:11:40.593 --> 01:11:41.593
Hey, stop!

996
01:11:41.678 --> 01:11:43.052
He's got Erica!

997
01:11:48.351 --> 01:11:49.351
Damn it.

998
01:11:49.436 --> 01:11:50.579
No, I'm
going in there.


999
01:11:50.603 --> 01:11:51.769
Why, why?

1000
01:11:51.855 --> 01:11:53.387
So we can have two hostages?

1001
01:11:53.481 --> 01:11:55.523
Backup is a couple
of minutes away!


1002
01:11:55.608 --> 01:11:56.649
Backup!?

1003
01:11:56.733 --> 01:11:57.733
Did you hear her?

1004
01:11:57.819 --> 01:11:59.727
She doesn't have a
couple of minutes!


1005
01:11:59.821 --> 01:12:01.528
Tell me I'm wrong.

1006
01:12:01.614 --> 01:12:03.573
Does she have a
couple of minutes?


1007
01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:05.908
I don't know.

1008
01:12:06.035 --> 01:12:08.119
Man, if you
don't let me in there,


1009
01:12:08.204 --> 01:12:09.495
I swear to God.

1010
01:12:09.581 --> 01:12:10.621
Mitch...

1011
01:12:10.707 --> 01:12:12.206
He's already
killed one person.


1012
01:12:12.292 --> 01:12:14.052
I'm not going to stand
here while that psycho


1013
01:12:14.085 --> 01:12:16.169
does whatever he
wants to my wife.


1014
01:12:16.254 --> 01:12:18.004
I need permission
to enter your home.


1015
01:12:18.089 --> 01:12:19.089
What?

1016
01:12:19.215 --> 01:12:20.443
Otherwise, I have
to wait for a warrant.


1017
01:12:20.467 --> 01:12:22.340
Do I have your permission?

1018
01:12:22.427 --> 01:12:24.302
Yeah, hell
yeah, you do!


1019
01:12:24.387 --> 01:12:25.720
Keys, keys, keys.

1020
01:12:25.805 --> 01:12:27.680
And I'm going to need
you back in the car.


1021
01:12:27.765 --> 01:12:30.683
I can't just have you
standing out here.


1022
01:12:32.019 --> 01:12:34.687
Please.

1023
01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:39.025
Do not
let him hurt her.


1024
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:40.902
Just turn
on my headlights.


1025
01:12:47.494 --> 01:12:49.443
Dispatch, this is unit 21.

1026
01:12:49.537 --> 01:12:50.945
I'm breaching the residence.

1027
01:12:51.039 --> 01:12:54.081
Attention all units,
I'm going in.


1028
01:12:54.167 --> 01:12:55.291
Argh!

1029
01:13:02.050 --> 01:13:04.675
Please, no,
Theodore, don't!


1030
01:13:10.266 --> 01:13:12.224
Theodore...

1031
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:15.853
they'll take it easy on
you if you just stop this.


1032
01:13:15.939 --> 01:13:18.147
Right now, right here.

1033
01:13:18.274 --> 01:13:19.640
It's not too late.

1034
01:13:19.733 --> 01:13:22.276
Just put the gun down
and I will tell them


1035
01:13:22.362 --> 01:13:25.312
that you let me go.

1036
01:13:25.406 --> 01:13:27.698
Theodore, please.

1037
01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:31.722
Dispatch: Backup
is imminent,


1038
01:13:31.746 --> 01:13:33.153
wait for additional
units to arrive.


1039
01:13:33.248 --> 01:13:35.873
Repeat, wait on the
additional units.


1040
01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:58.854
Don't!

1041
01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:24.005
Mr. Stenza!

1042
01:14:24.090 --> 01:14:25.539
LAPD!

1043
01:14:25.633 --> 01:14:27.425
Come out with your hands up!

1044
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:30.135
I do not want to hurt you!

1045
01:14:30.221 --> 01:14:32.263
Erica.

1046
01:14:32.348 --> 01:14:35.308
Don't move.

1047
01:14:45.612 --> 01:14:50.156
It was either this
or a play jet.


1048
01:14:50.241 --> 01:14:53.826
I told my son, son, a play
jet might be more fun.


1049
01:14:53.911 --> 01:14:56.829
You could fly it here, fly
it there, land it anywhere.


1050
01:14:56.914 --> 01:15:02.576
A pickup truck just
goes back and forth.


1051
01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:05.296
Do you know what he said to me?

1052
01:15:05.381 --> 01:15:07.298
No, I don't.

1053
01:15:07.383 --> 01:15:11.510
He said, Daddy,
red is my favorite color.


1054
01:15:19.771 --> 01:15:21.762
Dispatch: 21.

1055
01:15:21.856 --> 01:15:23.597
Unit 21, position.

1056
01:15:23.691 --> 01:15:25.274
Backup is two minutes away.

1057
01:15:25.401 --> 01:15:28.027
The kitchen, first
floor, back of the house.


1058
01:15:36.871 --> 01:15:40.081
Erica, want to play a game?

1059
01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:42.291
Sit down.

1060
01:15:42.418 --> 01:15:44.001
No.

1061
01:15:48.633 --> 01:15:51.133
Erica, sit down.

1062
01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:36.220
What the hell?

1063
01:16:47.358 --> 01:16:48.941
No.

1064
01:16:51.988 --> 01:16:54.572
No, no, no, turn
around, turn around!


1065
01:17:03.957 --> 01:17:07.293
This isn't your safe
place anymore, Theodore.


1066
01:17:07.378 --> 01:17:09.295
The police are going
to walk in that door


1067
01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:11.380
and they will do
whatever it takes


1068
01:17:11.507 --> 01:17:13.965
to get me out safely.

1069
01:17:14.051 --> 01:17:18.512
My wife made
this mobile for our son.


1070
01:17:18.598 --> 01:17:22.099
He loved space.

1071
01:17:22.185 --> 01:17:25.552
He wanted to be an astronaut.

1072
01:17:25.646 --> 01:17:27.813
They will come
in here and they will


1073
01:17:27.899 --> 01:17:30.390
see that body.

1074
01:17:30.485 --> 01:17:35.321
She worked on
it for about two weeks.


1075
01:17:35.406 --> 01:17:41.035
He said his truck
could fly to the moon.


1076
01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:43.746
They will kill you.

1077
01:17:43.873 --> 01:17:46.415
I don't want that to happen.

1078
01:17:46.542 --> 01:17:49.960
This isn't a game.

1079
01:17:50.046 --> 01:17:54.131
Right, game.

1080
01:18:47.103 --> 01:18:48.247
Sounds like things are getting

1081
01:18:48.271 --> 01:18:51.805
real torn up, up there.

1082
01:18:51.899 --> 01:18:55.818
It was a pickup truck.

1083
01:18:55.945 --> 01:18:58.528
He couldn't say it,
so he called it


1084
01:18:58.614 --> 01:19:03.075
his red hiccup truck.

1085
01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:05.119
What are you...?

1086
01:19:05.204 --> 01:19:11.332
I would count one, two, three...

1087
01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:15.087
and whoever could
grab it first won.


1088
01:19:20.845 --> 01:19:24.555
No, no.

1089
01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.683
I never won.

1090
01:19:27.810 --> 01:19:29.059
Please.

1091
01:19:54.503 --> 01:19:56.253
Oh my God.

1092
01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.423
One...

1093
01:19:59.508 --> 01:20:00.799
No.

1094
01:20:17.526 --> 01:20:20.736
Two...

1095
01:20:20.863 --> 01:20:21.946
Stop, please.

1096
01:20:22.031 --> 01:20:23.656
Please don't make me do this!

1097
01:20:23.741 --> 01:20:25.282
Please!

1098
01:20:38.965 --> 01:20:40.839
Hey, it's me!

1099
01:20:40.925 --> 01:20:42.800
It's me, hey.

1100
01:20:47.598 --> 01:20:50.015
Three.

1101
01:20:50.101 --> 01:20:51.517
Ahh!

1102
01:20:58.275 --> 01:20:59.650
Erica!

1103
01:20:59.735 --> 01:21:01.318
Hey!

1104
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:06.532
Jesus Christ.

1105
01:21:48.617 --> 01:21:52.453
Erica?

1106
01:21:52.537 --> 01:21:54.580
Erica.

1107
01:21:54.665 --> 01:21:57.707
You're safe now.

1108
01:21:57.793 --> 01:22:01.462
Mitch, get down here.

1109
01:22:01.546 --> 01:22:02.996
Erica!

1110
01:22:03.090 --> 01:22:04.381
Come on, then.

1111
01:22:04.467 --> 01:22:06.258
Let's get you out of here, okay?

1112
01:22:06.343 --> 01:22:07.843
Mitch?

1113
01:22:13.726 --> 01:22:14.808
Erica?

1114
01:22:14.894 --> 01:22:16.101
Mitch.

1115
01:22:18.355 --> 01:22:20.355
I love you!

1116
01:22:20.483 --> 01:22:22.357
Are you okay?

1117
01:22:25.988 --> 01:22:27.362
Are you okay?

1118
01:22:54.224 --> 01:22:56.016
Dispatch: All
units on scene,


1119
01:22:56.102 --> 01:22:57.684
with multiple casualties.

1120
01:22:57.769 --> 01:22:59.186
Scene is secured.

1121
01:22:59.271 --> 01:23:00.521
Officer: Clear a path here.

1122
01:23:10.116 --> 01:23:12.116
ASD reporting back to base.

1123
01:23:23.921 --> 01:23:26.588
Oh, Dan!

1124
01:23:26.715 --> 01:23:27.840
Oh my God.

1125
01:23:27.925 --> 01:23:29.258
Hey, hey.

1126
01:23:29.385 --> 01:23:30.884
There's nothing you
could have done.


1127
01:23:30.970 --> 01:23:33.679
Hey, look at me.

1128
01:23:33.764 --> 01:23:35.255
Hey.

1129
01:23:35.349 --> 01:23:36.368
If you weren't as
strong as you are,


1130
01:23:36.392 --> 01:23:39.643
there would be three
of those, okay?


1131
01:23:59.582 --> 01:24:03.116
I love you so much.

1132
01:24:03.210 --> 01:24:05.501
Hey, um,
I thought you might


1133
01:24:05.588 --> 01:24:08.955
like something warm to drink.

1134
01:24:09.049 --> 01:24:10.957
Careful, it's hot.

1135
01:24:11.051 --> 01:24:12.217
Thank you.

1136
01:24:12.303 --> 01:24:14.385
Sure.

1137
01:24:14.471 --> 01:24:17.764
He's dead, right?

1138
01:24:17.849 --> 01:24:19.224
Yes, he is.

1139
01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:21.310
He didn't
give you a choice.


1140
01:24:21.437 --> 01:24:23.187
You impress me,
Mrs. Bordine.


1141
01:24:23.272 --> 01:24:24.804
You're a very brave woman.

1142
01:24:24.899 --> 01:24:28.141
And just so you know,
we have counselors,


1143
01:24:28.235 --> 01:24:33.238
therapists, who are trained
to handle these situations.


1144
01:24:33.323 --> 01:24:35.823
Handle.

1145
01:24:35.951 --> 01:24:39.319
Have any of them
ever killed someone?


1146
01:24:39.412 --> 01:24:40.849
I don't know
the answer to that,


1147
01:24:40.873 --> 01:24:43.373
but I know that you did
what you had to do


1148
01:24:43.459 --> 01:24:45.751
in order to survive.

1149
01:24:45.836 --> 01:24:48.378
Bad things happen
to good people.


1150
01:24:48.464 --> 01:24:50.255
You're a good person.

1151
01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:52.799
I'm just glad we
didn't lose you.


1152
01:24:52.885 --> 01:24:56.385
And I thought you agreed
to stay in the car.


1153
01:24:56.472 --> 01:24:58.513
Well, don't
I look like someone


1154
01:24:58.641 --> 01:25:00.807
who would lie to you?

1155
01:25:00.893 --> 01:25:03.009
You do now.

1156
01:25:03.103 --> 01:25:04.478
You sure do.

1157
01:25:18.494 --> 01:25:23.247
Mitch, I don't
think I can stay here.


1158
01:25:23.332 --> 01:25:24.932
If you think
I could sleep through


1159
01:25:24.959 --> 01:25:29.126
one more night here,
you're crazy.


1160
01:25:29.213 --> 01:25:32.839
This is our home.

1161
01:25:32.925 --> 01:25:34.299
And it was his.

1162
01:25:34.385 --> 01:25:38.303
No, it's
just a house.


1163
01:25:38.389 --> 01:25:41.098
We'll find another one.
