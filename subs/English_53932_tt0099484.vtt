00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.200
THE AGES OF LULU

2
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:21.298
Get up, Lulu.
C'mon, get up.


3
00:03:20.318 --> 00:03:23.641
I'm off. Pablo's home
with my brother.


4
00:03:23.646 --> 00:03:26.474
He won't even look at you.

5
00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.187
That's all right.

6
00:03:31.813 --> 00:03:34.433
He will.

7
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.968
I can't go, Pablo.
My neck really hurts.


8
00:03:38.973 --> 00:03:42.470
What will I do
with two chicks?


9
00:03:42.475 --> 00:03:45.636
Take one
to your Mom's workshop.


10
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:49.964
<i>I was lucky enough
to see Pablo fairly often.</i>


11
00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.969
<i>He was
my brother's best friend.</i>


12
00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:01.505
You got an extra ticket
for the concert? I'd love to go.


13
00:04:02.631 --> 00:04:05.042
Shall I take her?

14
00:04:06.174 --> 00:04:08.794
Lulu?

15
00:04:10.297 --> 00:04:12.833
If she wants to...

16
00:04:12.838 --> 00:04:15.457
Go ahead.

17
00:04:15.962 --> 00:04:18.827
I'll go change.
- There's no need.


18
00:04:18.832 --> 00:04:21.493
You look fine.

19
00:04:22.458 --> 00:04:25.032
Wait.

20
00:04:36.286 --> 00:04:39.028
I'll do myself up...

21
00:04:39.117 --> 00:04:42.322
for the concert.

22
00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:04.520
Maite!
- Pablo!


23
00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:12.217
Maite and Almudena.
We had a date with them.


24
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.765
<i>I felt jealous.</i>

25
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.470
<i>I clung to him
as hard as I could.</i>


26
00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:24.682
<i>This was my chance.</i>

27
00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:33.925
What will you have?
- A gin & tonic.


28
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.423
My, my!

29
00:05:36.428 --> 00:05:39.921
A gin & tonic
and a plain gin, dry.


30
00:05:39.926 --> 00:05:42.587
Can I eat something?
- Of course.


31
00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.252
Some strawberry cake.

32
00:05:45.257 --> 00:05:48.543
Have you got any?
- Yes.


33
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.082
I like your blouse.
- Do you?


34
00:05:55.087 --> 00:05:58.290
Leave that button open.

35
00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:22.155
Young ladies
don't wolf their food down.


36
00:06:22.242 --> 00:06:26.323
I'm hungry.
- Or speak while eating.


37
00:06:27.573 --> 00:06:32.613
I don't like well mannered
young ladies.


38
00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:36.106
May I have another?

39
00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:39.229
Me too.
- You've had enough.


40
00:06:39.234 --> 00:06:42.557
Why?
- Because I say so.


41
00:07:05.058 --> 00:07:07.553
You're taking me home?

42
00:07:07.558 --> 00:07:10.180
Do you want me to?

43
00:07:56.746 --> 00:08:00.613
I've always had great faith
in you.


44
00:08:01.868 --> 00:08:04.940
I can't do anything.

45
00:08:08.741 --> 00:08:10.526
Don't worry...

46
00:08:10.531 --> 00:08:13.320
you'll learn.

47
00:08:39.521 --> 00:08:42.143
Come here.

48
00:08:54.513 --> 00:08:56.175
Not that.

49
00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.798
Anything, anytime,
but that.


50
00:09:03.386 --> 00:09:06.127
I understand.

51
00:09:07.842 --> 00:09:09.669
We're leaving?

52
00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:12.330
What else?

53
00:09:43.159 --> 00:09:45.155
Lulu...

54
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.783
What is it?

55
00:09:47.825 --> 00:09:50.532
Don't cry.

56
00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:54.483
I'm sorry. Really.

57
00:09:54.488 --> 00:09:56.901
Want to go home?

58
00:09:56.906 --> 00:10:01.068
No, please.

59
00:10:01.361 --> 00:10:05.890
Not home.
- Where, then?


60
00:10:06.817 --> 00:10:09.474
I don't know.

61
00:10:24.809 --> 00:10:30.299
My mother's workshop.
Marcelo and I come here occasionally.


62
00:10:41.138 --> 00:10:45.001
What dreadful shoes!

63
00:10:53.341 --> 00:10:56.044
Take them off.

64
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.958
Take off your panties.

65
00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:11.329
Why?
- Because I say so.


66
00:11:11.334 --> 00:11:16.408
Why did you button up
your blouse? Open it.


67
00:11:21.454 --> 00:11:24.409
Take off your panties.

68
00:11:38.446 --> 00:11:41.069
Come here.

69
00:11:48.108 --> 00:11:51.978
Who taught you that?
- What?


70
00:11:51.983 --> 00:11:55.602
To lift your skirt
to sit on a guy's knees.


71
00:11:55.607 --> 00:11:58.313
I don't know.

72
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.393
Come here.

73
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:09.427
Ever jerk off?

74
00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:14.924
Come on, Lulu.

75
00:12:14.929 --> 00:12:17.302
You can't fool me.

76
00:12:17.307 --> 00:12:20.460
You must never lie to me.

77
00:12:25.761 --> 00:12:28.585
Once, with a flute.

78
00:12:29.592 --> 00:12:32.169
With a flute?

79
00:12:33.757 --> 00:12:36.414
Tell me about it.

80
00:12:46.628 --> 00:12:48.745
Now, listen.

81
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.533
Want me to take you home
or what?


82
00:12:58.747 --> 00:13:03.491
What did you stick in,
the mouthpiece?


83
00:13:10.076 --> 00:13:12.948
The mouthpiece.

84
00:13:13.409 --> 00:13:16.232
Did you like it?

85
00:13:21.197 --> 00:13:23.941
Yeah, I did.

86
00:13:23.946 --> 00:13:27.065
But Amelia caught me
doing it.


87
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.064
And then, she told Marcelo.

88
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:33.307
So, Marcelo knew about it.

89
00:13:38.398 --> 00:13:41.101
Now, missy...

90
00:13:41.728 --> 00:13:43.390
don't cry.

91
00:13:43.395 --> 00:13:45.723
It's not bad.

92
00:13:45.728 --> 00:13:50.222
Everybody does it,
women just don't tell.


93
00:13:53.392 --> 00:13:56.098
I'll be right back.

94
00:14:02.052 --> 00:14:04.678
Pablo...

95
00:14:08.385 --> 00:14:10.713
It's just that...

96
00:14:10.718 --> 00:14:13.546
I've never been to bed
with anyone.


97
00:14:13.551 --> 00:14:15.919
We're not going to bed.

98
00:14:15.924 --> 00:14:18.211
There's no need.

99
00:14:18.216 --> 00:14:22.331
Yes, but...
I'm a virgin.


100
00:14:22.877 --> 00:14:25.585
Really?

101
00:14:43.037 --> 00:14:45.693
Here...

102
00:14:47.036 --> 00:14:50.569
Slide towards the edge.

103
00:14:52.701 --> 00:14:55.570
What are you doing?
- None of your business.


104
00:14:55.575 --> 00:14:57.528
What do you mean?

105
00:14:57.533 --> 00:15:00.855
Hush or I'll take you home.

106
00:15:01.364 --> 00:15:03.985
Alright.

107
00:15:11.025 --> 00:15:14.354
Tell me all about the flute.

108
00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:16.687
Whose idea was it?

109
00:15:16.692 --> 00:15:19.397
What about Amelia?

110
00:15:22.188 --> 00:15:24.681
I heard about it in school.

111
00:15:24.686 --> 00:15:27.890
Then, I was home alone...

112
00:15:27.895 --> 00:15:30.012
but it started raining.

113
00:15:30.017 --> 00:15:33.055
She came back...

114
00:15:33.352 --> 00:15:35.974
saw me...

115
00:15:39.013 --> 00:15:43.758
started screaming
and ran away.


116
00:15:44.345 --> 00:15:47.882
And then...
What's that?


117
00:15:47.887 --> 00:15:50.876
A razor blade.

118
00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:55.082
What for?

119
00:15:55.343 --> 00:15:58.795
To make you even prettier.

120
00:15:59.673 --> 00:16:02.294
Don't...

121
00:16:03.006 --> 00:16:04.667
Lulu...

122
00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:08.585
you must relax.

123
00:16:16.667 --> 00:16:20.161
You must play according
to the rules.


124
00:16:20.166 --> 00:16:22.660
I'm not playing!

125
00:16:22.665 --> 00:16:24.533
Sure you are...

126
00:16:24.538 --> 00:16:28.987
you just don't know it.
You're almost perfect.


127
00:16:28.992 --> 00:16:30.823
Let me finish...

128
00:16:30.828 --> 00:16:34.197
and you will be perfect.

129
00:16:39.656 --> 00:16:42.398
What did Marcelo say?

130
00:16:44.656 --> 00:16:47.313
He laughed...

131
00:16:49.653 --> 00:16:52.608
and laughed.

132
00:16:53.982 --> 00:16:56.724
He laughed...

133
00:16:57.482 --> 00:17:01.350
and told me
not to worry...


134
00:17:02.312 --> 00:17:05.388
not to worry because...

135
00:17:05.481 --> 00:17:10.886
he could shut Amelia up
whenever he wanted to...


136
00:17:10.978 --> 00:17:14.300
that it was normal...

137
00:17:15.183 --> 00:17:18.136
that everyone did it.

138
00:17:18.141 --> 00:17:21.262
Did he touch you?

139
00:17:23.182 --> 00:17:25.465
He's never touched you?

140
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.133
Of course not!

141
00:17:28.138 --> 00:17:31.376
Well, you're very close.

142
00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:36.296
Okay...

143
00:17:36.301 --> 00:17:39.126
All finished.

144
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.122
You look lovely.

145
00:17:45.629 --> 00:17:49.035
It wasn't that bad, was it?

146
00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:55.199
Now, missy,
do you feel better?


147
00:17:56.292 --> 00:17:59.413
Are you going to behave?

148
00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.910
Will you do as I say?

149
00:18:06.954 --> 00:18:09.577
Come...

150
00:18:14.284 --> 00:18:16.905
Come on.

151
00:18:17.826 --> 00:18:20.649
Are you mad at me?

152
00:18:24.282 --> 00:18:28.309
It won't be in a bed
but we'll do it.


153
00:18:35.608 --> 00:18:38.311
Sit down.

154
00:18:39.814 --> 00:18:42.475
Lie down.

155
00:19:24.466 --> 00:19:27.169
Does it hurt?

156
00:19:30.921 --> 00:19:32.749
Do you like it?

157
00:19:32.754 --> 00:19:35.376
Do you?

158
00:19:36.251 --> 00:19:38.909
Yeah, I do...

159
00:19:38.914 --> 00:19:43.448
But I like it better
if you're on top.


160
00:19:44.749 --> 00:19:47.403
Want to try?

161
00:19:47.914 --> 00:19:50.537
Here...

162
00:19:52.246 --> 00:19:55.152
Don't let it slip out.

163
00:20:07.406 --> 00:20:10.029
Move.

164
00:20:12.071 --> 00:20:17.229
Like that?
- Faster. Move faster.


165
00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:30.355
Slow down.

166
00:20:37.765 --> 00:20:42.054
Imagine you're doing a figure eight.
- A figure eight?


167
00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:44.681
A figure eight.

168
00:20:52.052 --> 00:20:54.549
That's right...

169
00:20:54.554 --> 00:20:57.206
That's good.

170
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:02.543
You what?

171
00:21:03.092 --> 00:21:05.961
You're out of your mind!

172
00:21:05.966 --> 00:21:08.917
How did you do it?

173
00:21:08.922 --> 00:21:13.749
First, I got on top, and then he...
- I don't mean that.


174
00:21:13.754 --> 00:21:16.746
Are you on the pill?

175
00:21:16.751 --> 00:21:19.747
I hadn't thought about it.

176
00:21:19.752 --> 00:21:22.787
Did he wear a rubber?

177
00:21:23.079 --> 00:21:25.706
I didn't check.

178
00:21:26.083 --> 00:21:28.871
Don't you care?

179
00:21:31.078 --> 00:21:34.907
I mean, really,
you got no sense.


180
00:21:34.912 --> 00:21:39.437
Didn't Marcelo tell you
Pablo's going to the States?


181
00:21:39.738 --> 00:21:42.366
Lulu!

182
00:21:43.573 --> 00:21:47.442
What is it, darling?
- Let me be!


183
00:21:49.406 --> 00:21:53.563
Lulu, darling
let me in.


184
00:21:54.613 --> 00:21:57.849
Lulu, please,
open the door!


185
00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.100
Why? Why?

186
00:22:18.894 --> 00:22:23.339
I won't forget two things
about tonight.


187
00:22:23.559 --> 00:22:27.554
One, the armchair
where you shaved me.


188
00:22:29.718 --> 00:22:32.678
Know what else?

189
00:22:34.053 --> 00:22:37.206
The way this couch creaked.

190
00:22:55.708 --> 00:23:01.000
A letter from Pablo.
Look, he sent a picture.


191
00:23:01.706 --> 00:23:04.665
He looks so American...

192
00:23:24.701 --> 00:23:29.989
Lulu, promise you'll always
remember two things.


193
00:23:31.031 --> 00:23:35.856
One, that sex and love are
two different things.


194
00:23:36.196 --> 00:23:40.972
Good.
What happened tonight was love.


195
00:23:42.564 --> 00:23:47.395
I don't understand.
- It's okay, just promise.


196
00:23:48.021 --> 00:23:50.600
I promise.

197
00:23:57.142 --> 00:24:00.848
Pablo is coming back tomorrow.
Can you imagine?


198
00:24:00.853 --> 00:24:04.554
He may have forgotten you.
- I hope not.


199
00:24:04.559 --> 00:24:07.009
Will you do me a favor?

200
00:24:07.014 --> 00:24:09.836
Of course.

201
00:24:10.348 --> 00:24:13.170
Will you help me shave?

202
00:24:15.014 --> 00:24:17.802
Shave what?

203
00:24:19.008 --> 00:24:21.630
My cunt.

204
00:24:23.674 --> 00:24:26.416
You're crazy.

205
00:24:28.175 --> 00:24:30.999
I'm not crazy.

206
00:25:10.657 --> 00:25:15.650
Today, we have here with us
some very famous specialists.


207
00:25:15.655 --> 00:25:20.517
On my right, Pierre Guillot,
from Dijon University.


208
00:25:25.647 --> 00:25:30.262
Next to him, Pepe Cepeda,
my assistant.


209
00:25:33.856 --> 00:25:38.931
And, finally, on my left,
Prof. Pablo Martinez...


210
00:25:45.972 --> 00:25:50.966
just back from the
University of Philadelphia.


211
00:25:56.972 --> 00:25:59.594
Lulu...

212
00:26:03.843 --> 00:26:06.633
I'm so glad you came.

213
00:26:07.634 --> 00:26:10.795
How are you?
- Happy.


214
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.665
Why?
- Because.


215
00:26:15.964 --> 00:26:20.622
My mother closed her shop,
I'm making do here.


216
00:26:25.627 --> 00:26:29.453
I brought you something.
- You did?


217
00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:33.747
I wanted to see you...

218
00:26:53.949 --> 00:26:57.732
You brought me something?
- Sure.


219
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.436
What?

220
00:27:01.441 --> 00:27:04.481
An American flute.

221
00:27:04.486 --> 00:27:08.897
What's an American flute?
- You'll see.


222
00:27:14.773 --> 00:27:16.766
I couldn't resist...

223
00:27:16.771 --> 00:27:20.390
I thought I'd never
give it to you.


224
00:27:20.474 --> 00:27:22.599
Gift-wrapped!

225
00:27:22.604 --> 00:27:25.226
By me.

226
00:27:30.596 --> 00:27:34.049
I'm glad you thought
about me.


227
00:27:52.753 --> 00:27:57.414
All this time, I never forgave myself...
- What for?


228
00:27:57.419 --> 00:28:02.824
Not having touched myself that night.
- Don't be silly!


229
00:28:02.915 --> 00:28:05.626
You wanted me to.

230
00:28:12.246 --> 00:28:15.039
Shall I try it?

231
00:28:24.241 --> 00:28:27.863
I want to do
what you like best.


232
00:28:32.571 --> 00:28:37.402
It's weird...
It's got nothing to do with a man.


233
00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:42.898
It's...

234
00:28:42.903 --> 00:28:44.898
It's cold.

235
00:28:44.903 --> 00:28:47.644
It isn't warm...

236
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.521
And I must move it myself...

237
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:03.216
No changes in rhythm.

238
00:29:04.895 --> 00:29:08.719
No...
jamming on the brakes.


239
00:29:08.724 --> 00:29:11.882
No revving up the engine.

240
00:29:11.887 --> 00:29:16.251
And I like breaking
the speed limit.


241
00:29:17.885 --> 00:29:20.713
Did you do it a lot
all these years?


242
00:29:20.718 --> 00:29:23.841
I always thought of you.

243
00:29:29.385 --> 00:29:32.707
Once...
I dreamt...


244
00:29:32.712 --> 00:29:36.041
you were my father.
We lived together.


245
00:29:36.046 --> 00:29:38.704
We were very happy.

246
00:29:38.709 --> 00:29:40.416
I believe you.

247
00:29:40.421 --> 00:29:43.870
I'd like to have a daughter
like you.


248
00:29:43.875 --> 00:29:47.035
You were a bad daddy...

249
00:29:47.378 --> 00:29:51.080
Perverted...
Incestuous...


250
00:29:51.085 --> 00:29:53.370
I believe that too.

251
00:29:53.375 --> 00:29:55.364
Look...

252
00:29:55.369 --> 00:29:57.997
It's for you.

253
00:29:59.204 --> 00:30:01.912
You're wonderful.

254
00:30:05.201 --> 00:30:08.023
Take it out.

255
00:30:11.535 --> 00:30:15.448
You did it on your own?
- For you.


256
00:30:20.529 --> 00:30:23.320
Come here.

257
00:30:35.525 --> 00:30:39.640
What are you doing?
- Can't you see?


258
00:30:42.685 --> 00:30:45.346
Come here.

259
00:30:49.061 --> 00:30:52.426
Don't move.
- Be careful...


260
00:30:52.518 --> 00:30:55.887
You're hurting me.
- Relax.


261
00:31:08.012 --> 00:31:10.717
There...

262
00:31:40.831 --> 00:31:43.567
I love you.

263
00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.902
I love you.

264
00:31:54.159 --> 00:31:56.863
Lulu...

265
00:31:57.825 --> 00:32:00.696
will you marry me?

266
00:32:05.934 --> 00:32:08.262
I'm getting married...

267
00:32:08.267 --> 00:32:11.881
I'm getting married...
Married!


268
00:32:33.576 --> 00:32:38.069
The bride's something else, isn't she?
- You bet.


269
00:32:38.074 --> 00:32:42.188
It's the only reason
they married.


270
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:48.294
Grandma, why is Auntie
wearing a nightgown?


271
00:32:49.057 --> 00:32:51.011
It's a dress, love...

272
00:32:51.016 --> 00:32:54.002
not a nightgown.

273
00:33:02.173 --> 00:33:05.876
You chose the best
sister ever.


274
00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:11.500
Congratulations.

275
00:33:24.835 --> 00:33:29.329
Can you imagine?
They served frozen food!


276
00:33:29.334 --> 00:33:32.323
Yes, how common.

277
00:33:37.495 --> 00:33:40.653
Why couldn't you have
a normal wedding party?


278
00:33:40.658 --> 00:33:44.150
This is more fun, Mom.

279
00:33:44.493 --> 00:33:48.152
Hurray for the newlyweds!
- Hurray!


280
00:33:48.157 --> 00:33:51.441
A kiss!
Let them kiss!


281
00:33:57.697 --> 00:34:00.931
There's no need to carry me!

282
00:34:05.819 --> 00:34:08.146
I'm dizzy...

283
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:11.982
What are you doing?
- It's a surprise.


284
00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.052
What is it?

285
00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:28.433
You're crazy!

286
00:34:31.808 --> 00:34:35.468
When did you get it?
- This morning.


287
00:34:35.473 --> 00:34:38.262
You're mad...

288
00:34:54.465 --> 00:35:00.453
We'll lock ourselves up,
screw all the time and never go out.


289
00:35:00.794 --> 00:35:03.372
You're mad!

290
00:35:03.458 --> 00:35:06.167
About you.

291
00:35:06.792 --> 00:35:09.583
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

292
00:35:09.664 --> 00:35:11.451
<i>Living on my own...</i>

293
00:35:11.456 --> 00:35:17.078
<i>Pablo and I making love
until we were exhausted.</i>


294
00:35:18.122 --> 00:35:22.036
<i>This was the best time
of my life.</i>


295
00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:10.116
Thanks.

296
00:37:13.409 --> 00:37:16.778
Antonio, a coffee, please.

297
00:37:17.406 --> 00:37:20.028
You like them?

298
00:37:22.404 --> 00:37:25.442
I like looking at them.

299
00:37:25.736 --> 00:37:29.105
We'll go watch them tonight.

300
00:37:30.568 --> 00:37:34.728
<i>Hunting transvestites was
one of my favorite games.</i>


301
00:37:34.733 --> 00:37:36.728
<i>It fascinated me.</i>

302
00:37:36.733 --> 00:37:40.225
<i>I knew it was unfair, unkind even.</i>

303
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:43.390
Wouldn't you love
to suck me dry, faggot?


304
00:37:43.395 --> 00:37:47.677
<i>I couldn't help it.</i>
- And ring my chimes?


305
00:37:47.728 --> 00:37:52.388
You're off your rocker.
- Fuck off, fairy!


306
00:37:52.393 --> 00:37:55.513
Look, that one, over there.

307
00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.885
<i>And that's how...</i>

308
00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:02.717
<i>we met Ely
a wonderful transvestite.</i>


309
00:38:02.722 --> 00:38:05.049
Hi there, love.

310
00:38:05.054 --> 00:38:07.795
Want a jump in the hay?

311
00:38:08.717 --> 00:38:11.460
Step on it!

312
00:38:15.883 --> 00:38:18.044
You love this kind
of thing!


313
00:38:18.049 --> 00:38:24.379
Besides, when you want something...
- That's right.


314
00:38:30.709 --> 00:38:32.704
Shit!

315
00:38:32.709 --> 00:38:35.703
<i>I did have some problems
at home...</i>


316
00:38:35.708 --> 00:38:39.030
<i>But Pablo never complained.</i>

317
00:38:42.372 --> 00:38:45.492
This looks delicious!

318
00:38:45.579 --> 00:38:48.905
It reminds me of a girl
I once knew...


319
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:52.696
Let me be.
Everything went wrong today.


320
00:38:52.701 --> 00:38:54.904
Take it easy.

321
00:38:54.909 --> 00:38:59.319
Dress up and we'll go catch
transvestites.


322
00:39:04.238 --> 00:39:06.233
Get closer...

323
00:39:06.238 --> 00:39:08.024
Bastard!

324
00:39:08.029 --> 00:39:10.816
What's going on?

325
00:39:14.693 --> 00:39:17.186
What the fuck...?

326
00:39:17.191 --> 00:39:20.852
Don't you touch my man, do you hear?
- Lay off, bitch!


327
00:39:20.857 --> 00:39:22.683
You shithead!

328
00:39:22.688 --> 00:39:25.683
Go to hell!
- Cunt!


329
00:39:25.688 --> 00:39:28.014
Kill the bitch!

330
00:39:28.019 --> 00:39:29.681
I'm sorry...

331
00:39:29.686 --> 00:39:31.847
it's our fault.
Cool it.


332
00:39:31.852 --> 00:39:36.679
You bet it is! Who the hell
do you think you are?


333
00:39:36.684 --> 00:39:40.171
Hang on to her,
she's got a temper.


334
00:39:43.555 --> 00:39:46.673
My name's Ely, with a "y".

335
00:39:46.678 --> 00:39:48.339
Pablo.

336
00:39:48.344 --> 00:39:52.214
She's Lulu.
- Lulu! That's cute!


337
00:39:52.219 --> 00:39:55.670
Want to come
and have a bite?


338
00:39:55.675 --> 00:39:57.544
To eat?

339
00:39:57.549 --> 00:40:00.876
I may sound Andalusian,
but I ain't.


340
00:40:00.881 --> 00:40:04.000
I'm from Medellin,
a small town.


341
00:40:04.005 --> 00:40:07.998
You know, the cradle
of conquerors...


342
00:40:08.003 --> 00:40:11.787
I'm worried
about having hit you.


343
00:40:13.002 --> 00:40:16.784
No, don't worry.
- I won't.


344
00:40:18.499 --> 00:40:20.660
Whatcha looking at?

345
00:40:20.665 --> 00:40:23.950
Wanna see? Look!

346
00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:29.323
They look good.
- Natural.


347
00:40:29.328 --> 00:40:32.199
Totally natural.

348
00:40:33.659 --> 00:40:36.317
They're pretty.

349
00:40:40.657 --> 00:40:42.484
If you want to...

350
00:40:42.489 --> 00:40:44.651
just for once...

351
00:40:44.656 --> 00:40:49.434
some free champagne
in bed for nothing.


352
00:40:49.987 --> 00:40:52.811
I wouldn't mind.

353
00:40:55.151 --> 00:40:58.977
Drink up.
- We can do it in the car.


354
00:40:58.982 --> 00:41:02.642
Not very romantic
but I'm used to it.


355
00:41:02.647 --> 00:41:04.808
Stop!
- Not here.


356
00:41:04.813 --> 00:41:07.600
Stop, goddamn it!

357
00:41:07.605 --> 00:41:10.927
Happy?

358
00:41:13.311 --> 00:41:15.304
Where is she going?

359
00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:17.303
What's up?

360
00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:20.301
She wants to see your prick.

361
00:41:20.306 --> 00:41:22.468
May I?

362
00:41:22.473 --> 00:41:25.014
Go ahead.

363
00:41:29.303 --> 00:41:32.044
Lulu's too much...

364
00:41:33.303 --> 00:41:37.831
Let me see...
Let me feel your tits...


365
00:41:43.297 --> 00:41:46.667
Jesus, she gets turned on!

366
00:41:51.503 --> 00:41:54.078
Feel!

367
00:41:57.292 --> 00:42:00.328
Come on, I know a place!

368
00:42:00.333 --> 00:42:03.244
A little champagne
will help us get along.


369
00:42:03.249 --> 00:42:05.954
For Lulu.

370
00:42:06.246 --> 00:42:08.241
Here, love.
- Thanks.


371
00:42:08.246 --> 00:42:10.951
For you, darling.

372
00:42:11.911 --> 00:42:15.862
Goodness!
It brings good luck.


373
00:42:16.076 --> 00:42:18.571
Luck!

374
00:42:18.576 --> 00:42:21.111
My, he's well hung!

375
00:42:21.116 --> 00:42:26.238
Come here, love,
have some honey. Honey...


376
00:42:28.238 --> 00:42:31.109
That's it, eat it.

377
00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:35.228
Gracious me!

378
00:42:42.441 --> 00:42:45.395
It's still growing!

379
00:42:47.106 --> 00:42:49.811
I'll show you mine.

380
00:42:52.229 --> 00:42:54.555
Like her?

381
00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.266
I like you.

382
00:43:00.433 --> 00:43:02.719
I'm dry.

383
00:43:02.724 --> 00:43:06.720
Pablo...
Look at my lips...


384
00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:15.214
C'mon, Lulu...

385
00:43:15.219 --> 00:43:18.541
leave something for me.

386
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:22.877
Look at me, Pablo.

387
00:43:22.882 --> 00:43:25.539
Darling...

388
00:43:45.747 --> 00:43:47.368
I'm yours...

389
00:43:47.373 --> 00:43:49.534
All yours...

390
00:43:49.539 --> 00:43:52.195
I'm yours.

391
00:43:54.536 --> 00:43:56.406
Take me.

392
00:43:56.411 --> 00:43:59.068
I'm yours.

393
00:44:04.199 --> 00:44:06.903
Don't be greedy.

394
00:44:08.198 --> 00:44:11.190
Leave something for me.

395
00:44:11.195 --> 00:44:13.771
Let's see...

396
00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:18.109
It's incredible!

397
00:44:26.398 --> 00:44:28.392
Take me, darling.

398
00:44:28.397 --> 00:44:31.019
Take me...

399
00:44:35.353 --> 00:44:38.473
Take me...
Take me...


400
00:44:40.018 --> 00:44:42.807
Me...

401
00:44:55.386 --> 00:44:58.008
Hey!

402
00:44:58.219 --> 00:45:01.292
What about me?

403
00:45:28.373 --> 00:45:31.034
Want me to do something?

404
00:45:31.039 --> 00:45:33.695
Touch yourself.

405
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:36.819
I'll tear your panties.

406
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.657
What is it?

407
00:47:15.288 --> 00:47:17.910
I'm all upset...

408
00:47:21.118 --> 00:47:25.069
I'm so silly, I get sad.

409
00:47:25.117 --> 00:47:28.899
I'm sorry.
Forgive us.


410
00:47:31.781 --> 00:47:34.438
Ely!

411
00:47:42.441 --> 00:47:44.603
Don't worry...

412
00:47:44.608 --> 00:47:47.267
it's alright.

413
00:47:50.771 --> 00:47:52.433
Ely...

414
00:47:52.438 --> 00:47:55.890
whatever you want
whenever you say.


415
00:48:30.091 --> 00:48:32.416
Lulu!

416
00:48:32.421 --> 00:48:35.083
How are you?
You look great!


417
00:48:35.088 --> 00:48:38.748
You're looking good too.
- Thank you.


418
00:48:38.753 --> 00:48:40.414
I love your blouse.

419
00:48:40.419 --> 00:48:42.081
Do you?
- Really.


420
00:48:42.086 --> 00:48:45.079
I got it in a neat shop
near here.


421
00:48:45.084 --> 00:48:48.831
Want to have a look?
You'll go crazy.


422
00:48:49.748 --> 00:48:54.493
Will Pablo like it?
- He'll love it.


423
00:48:54.581 --> 00:48:57.908
Don't get your hopes up
with men.


424
00:48:57.913 --> 00:49:01.406
The older they get,
the younger they like them.


425
00:49:01.411 --> 00:49:03.405
Believe me.

426
00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:07.525
Just because
it happened to her...


427
00:49:32.274 --> 00:49:36.389
Pablo, you've forgotten
your watch!


428
00:49:43.393 --> 00:49:45.597
Like it?

429
00:49:45.602 --> 00:49:48.307
It's baby-like...

430
00:49:49.057 --> 00:49:53.007
Where did you get it?
- I can't tell.


431
00:50:01.887 --> 00:50:05.836
I must get to work.
Good bye.


432
00:50:15.047 --> 00:50:17.669
Bye!

433
00:50:24.711 --> 00:50:27.949
I'm staying.

434
00:50:28.041 --> 00:50:30.617
You're leaving.

435
00:50:30.707 --> 00:50:34.909
Go away, they're waiting
for you at University.


436
00:50:34.914 --> 00:50:38.319
Go away.
You must go.


437
00:50:38.913 --> 00:50:41.365
They're waiting...
- I don't want to.


438
00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:45.734
What do you mean?
- I'm staying here forever.


439
00:50:46.035 --> 00:50:49.736
Duty calls upon you.

440
00:50:50.033 --> 00:50:52.655
I'm staying.

441
00:50:53.573 --> 00:50:55.692
You can't...

442
00:50:55.697 --> 00:50:59.025
What will people say?
- Yes, you're right.


443
00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:01.819
I have to go?

444
00:51:13.356 --> 00:51:16.017
Don't you like it?

445
00:51:16.022 --> 00:51:18.680
I want more.

446
00:51:20.021 --> 00:51:23.722
Let's do it the way
you like it.


447
00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:58.625
Know what I like best?

448
00:51:59.547 --> 00:52:02.869
To have you come inside me.

449
00:52:06.001 --> 00:52:10.329
I'd like to have a daughter
just like you.


450
00:52:21.662 --> 00:52:23.990
<i>Ines arrived.</i>

451
00:52:23.995 --> 00:52:26.322
<i>She was wonderful.</i>

452
00:52:26.327 --> 00:52:28.655
<i>I loved watching her.</i>

453
00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:31.654
<i>She looked like me.</i>

454
00:52:31.659 --> 00:52:34.193
<i>Pablo always said...</i>

455
00:52:34.198 --> 00:52:37.317
<i>he wanted a daughter
like me...</i>


456
00:52:37.322 --> 00:52:39.816
<i>and he got his way.</i>

457
00:52:39.821 --> 00:52:42.482
<i>At first, she cried a lot.</i>

458
00:52:42.487 --> 00:52:46.314
<i>When she did,
only I could quiet her.</i>


459
00:52:46.319 --> 00:52:50.564
<i>Those were peaceful,
happy years.</i>


460
00:52:50.984 --> 00:52:56.934
<i>Ely often came to see us.
She loved playing with Ines.</i>


461
00:52:57.199 --> 00:52:59.975
<i>I often wondered...</i>

462
00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:04.309
<i>if that was the way
to bring up a child.</i>


463
00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:08.971
<i>Everything was fine.</i>

464
00:53:08.976 --> 00:53:11.137
<i>But it went all wrong.</i>

465
00:53:11.142 --> 00:53:14.097
<i>Chelo threw a party.</i>

466
00:53:15.307 --> 00:53:18.176
<i>She invited my brother.</i>

467
00:53:18.181 --> 00:53:21.420
<i>He was doing fine...</i>

468
00:53:21.512 --> 00:53:23.964
<i>making money...</i>

469
00:53:23.969 --> 00:53:29.257
Here's the one who wanted to meet you.
Lulu, Jose Antonio.


470
00:53:29.968 --> 00:53:34.581
We've been friends since college.
She's my best friend.


471
00:53:34.633 --> 00:53:38.544
Jesus! Your wife certainly
looks good.


472
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:41.291
If she weren't my sister...

473
00:53:41.296 --> 00:53:43.290
Yeah...

474
00:53:43.295 --> 00:53:48.369
You should try and find a Lulu...
- Balls!


475
00:53:53.291 --> 00:53:56.081
How about that cutie?

476
00:53:58.165 --> 00:54:00.159
She's been eyeing us.

477
00:54:00.164 --> 00:54:03.734
Some more champagne?
- Alright.


478
00:54:45.936 --> 00:54:47.930
What a child!

479
00:54:47.935 --> 00:54:54.935
Listen, Cristina what if a few of us go
to Marcelo's place?


480
00:54:57.265 --> 00:55:02.134
What a place! Are you an art collector?
- No, I'm an investor.


481
00:55:02.139 --> 00:55:04.714
Here.

482
00:55:14.259 --> 00:55:18.539
I won't ever drink again
in my whole life.


483
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:21.414
I don't wanna play...

484
00:55:36.583 --> 00:55:39.905
You sure you won't back out?

485
00:55:40.581 --> 00:55:43.157
Not if you're here.

486
00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:48.742
You're wonderful.

487
00:55:57.450 --> 00:56:00.191
I'll gag you.

488
00:58:43.573 --> 00:58:45.775
Where are you?

489
00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:48.402
Here.

490
01:00:25.114 --> 01:00:28.442
It's weird.
Strange.


491
01:00:28.447 --> 01:00:32.443
Weren't we all gonna play?
- Forget it.


492
01:00:32.612 --> 01:00:36.439
What then?
Should we go see?


493
01:00:36.444 --> 01:00:39.267
They'll call us.

494
01:00:47.564 --> 01:00:50.105
Come on...

495
01:01:19.717 --> 01:01:22.376
I feel dizzy.

496
01:02:24.692 --> 01:02:27.685
I'm sorry.
I mean it.


497
01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:30.396
It's all my fault.

498
01:02:31.356 --> 01:02:34.723
Marcelo's my best friend.

499
01:02:35.687 --> 01:02:39.637
I had been thinking
about it for years.


500
01:02:43.225 --> 01:02:47.139
I had no idea
you'd take it so badly.


501
01:02:48.182 --> 01:02:50.842
I'm sorry.

502
01:02:50.847 --> 01:02:55.709
That's not it.
It's just the last straw.


503
01:02:56.553 --> 01:02:59.006
I feel insecure.

504
01:02:59.011 --> 01:03:01.505
Insecure? How?

505
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:06.002
Because I'm not the same
for you anymore.


506
01:03:06.007 --> 01:03:09.164
I don't want to be a child.

507
01:03:12.338 --> 01:03:14.332
Don't you see?

508
01:03:14.337 --> 01:03:18.331
If I had said no, you'd have
gone to bed with Cristina.


509
01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:20.995
Does it matter?
- A lot.


510
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.074
Do you want to wreck it all?
- Listen, I'm leaving.


511
01:03:26.541 --> 01:03:28.993
Why can't you understand?

512
01:03:28.998 --> 01:03:30.992
I'm only sure about...

513
01:03:30.997 --> 01:03:34.995
not wanting to be a child
any more.


514
01:04:01.651 --> 01:04:04.273
Got everything?

515
01:04:09.981 --> 01:04:12.603
The computer too?

516
01:04:13.855 --> 01:04:16.680
Yes, it's mine.

517
01:04:42.801 --> 01:04:47.166
<i>I had never planned
on committing incest.</i>


518
01:04:48.132 --> 01:04:51.835
<i>I liked the idea of him
keeping my blouse.</i>


519
01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:56.002
<i>I didn't know if I was
leaving forever.</i>


520
01:04:56.794 --> 01:05:02.949
<i>Actually, I didn't even know
why I was leaving.</i>


521
01:05:03.168 --> 01:05:06.039
<i>It was all so hard...</i>

522
01:05:06.126 --> 01:05:08.952
<i>finding an apartment...</i>

523
01:05:08.957 --> 01:05:10.951
<i>looking after Ines...</i>

524
01:05:10.956 --> 01:05:15.617
<i>taking her to Pablo
and having to see him...</i>


525
01:05:16.787 --> 01:05:20.535
<i>I didn't think
I could bear it all.</i>


526
01:05:20.952 --> 01:05:23.946
<i>I felt powerless
and alone...</i>


527
01:05:23.951 --> 01:05:26.573
<i>so alone.</i>

528
01:07:46.226 --> 01:07:50.840
<i>I couldn't look
for another Pablo, it was absurd.</i>


529
01:07:52.225 --> 01:07:56.056
<i>Sex became
my safety valve.</i>


530
01:07:57.223 --> 01:08:00.673
<i>One evening, 
I saw different...</i>

531
01:08:00.678 --> 01:08:03.882
<i>kind of porno film.</i>

532
01:08:04.218 --> 01:08:08.714
<i>Seeing two men making love
turned me on so much.</i>


533
01:08:10.091 --> 01:08:12.962
<i>I decided to go for it.</i>

534
01:10:37.032 --> 01:10:39.655
A Scotch, please.

535
01:10:51.484 --> 01:10:54.936
Well?
Like them?


536
01:10:55.149 --> 01:10:58.933
Why?
What's strange about that?


537
01:10:59.814 --> 01:11:04.641
Men like dykes and no one
thinks it's weird.


538
01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:08.767
Why shouldn't I like gays?

539
01:11:08.853 --> 01:11:12.470
You mean you'd like
to go to bed with them...


540
01:11:12.475 --> 01:11:14.802
and watch them do it?

541
01:11:14.807 --> 01:11:16.802
Sure...

542
01:11:16.807 --> 01:11:19.597
I wouldn't mind.

543
01:11:21.138 --> 01:11:25.300
Want me to talk to them?
- Would you?


544
01:11:39.965 --> 01:11:43.456
You're not scared, are you?

545
01:11:43.461 --> 01:11:46.622
What do you want us to do?

546
01:11:46.627 --> 01:11:49.583
I don't know.
- You don't...


547
01:11:50.126 --> 01:11:54.286
Listen, I can do anything
with him I feel like.


548
01:11:54.291 --> 01:11:56.118
Like him?

549
01:11:56.123 --> 01:11:58.326
Touch him...

550
01:11:58.331 --> 01:12:00.789
Touch him.

551
01:12:01.956 --> 01:12:04.531
Touch him.

552
01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:09.274
Like him?
Touch him.


553
01:12:09.286 --> 01:12:11.909
Touch him.

554
01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:27.896
Well? Aren't you going
to undress?


555
01:12:32.441 --> 01:12:34.934
Look...

556
01:12:34.984 --> 01:12:38.223
See? That's a chick.

557
01:12:38.605 --> 01:12:42.887
She ain't bad looking.
Like her?


558
01:12:43.647 --> 01:12:46.720
Want him to eat your cunt?

559
01:12:58.597 --> 01:13:01.089
Eat it.

560
01:13:01.098 --> 01:13:03.753
Eat it.

561
01:13:05.638 --> 01:13:07.258
Eat it.

562
01:13:07.263 --> 01:13:09.920
It's all yours.

563
01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:18.293
You're gonna screw her,
like it or not.


564
01:13:18.298 --> 01:13:21.003
C'mon, come here.

565
01:13:22.755 --> 01:13:25.462
Sit down.

566
01:13:26.962 --> 01:13:29.704
Ever screwed a girl?

567
01:13:30.295 --> 01:13:33.414
It's high time
you tried it.


568
01:13:33.419 --> 01:13:36.412
It's very easy,
I'll help you.


569
01:13:36.417 --> 01:13:39.040
Please, no...
- Kneel down.


570
01:13:41.079 --> 01:13:45.612
Don't make me do it.
- Kneel, I said. Put it on.


571
01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.240
Very good.

572
01:13:49.245 --> 01:13:51.406
All you gotta do...

573
01:13:51.411 --> 01:13:54.696
is stick it inside...

574
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:58.570
she's waiting.
I'll help you.


575
01:13:58.575 --> 01:14:01.361
You may even like it.

576
01:14:09.235 --> 01:14:11.231
C'mon, raise your ass.

577
01:14:11.236 --> 01:14:13.395
Don't be selfish, kid...

578
01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.396
she wants some too.

579
01:14:15.401 --> 01:14:18.021
No, don't!

580
01:14:18.731 --> 01:14:21.892
Relax. I'll do it.

581
01:14:21.897 --> 01:14:25.221
Help me...
Help me...


582
01:14:25.397 --> 01:14:28.553
I can't. Help me!

583
01:14:32.936 --> 01:14:35.722
Like it?

584
01:15:06.047 --> 01:15:08.375
She's come already.

585
01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:10.249
C'mon, again.

586
01:15:10.254 --> 01:15:12.540
C'mon, Pablito,...

587
01:15:12.545 --> 01:15:15.038
make her come again.

588
01:15:15.043 --> 01:15:16.705
Come on.

589
01:15:16.710 --> 01:15:19.365
Come on...

590
01:15:19.709 --> 01:15:23.200
I'm right here with you. C'mon...

591
01:15:23.205 --> 01:15:26.325
That's it, there you go.

592
01:15:31.204 --> 01:15:35.068
Bang her real good.
Give it to her.


593
01:15:46.028 --> 01:15:48.688
Count it.

594
01:15:51.196 --> 01:15:53.190
Okay?

595
01:15:53.195 --> 01:15:55.982
I'm going to shower.

596
01:15:56.692 --> 01:15:59.398
You know the way out.

597
01:16:15.852 --> 01:16:19.343
<i>I liked seeing two men
doing it.</i>


598
01:16:19.348 --> 01:16:22.885
<i>Men like seeing women
screwing.</i>


599
01:16:22.890 --> 01:16:25.927
<i>Women don't turn me on.</i>

600
01:16:27.348 --> 01:16:30.215
<i>I had felt strangely happy.</i>

601
01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:32.005
<i>I felt lost...</i>

602
01:16:32.010 --> 01:16:35.083
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

603
01:16:56.336 --> 01:16:59.162
<i>Just calling them up excited me.</i>

604
01:16:59.167 --> 01:17:02.490
It's about the ad...

605
01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:09.322
<i>Then, going to an hotel
and watching them...</i>


606
01:17:09.327 --> 01:17:12.655
<i>while I touched myself.</i>

607
01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:14.864
<i>I got whatever I wanted.</i>

608
01:17:14.869 --> 01:17:17.527
<i>I couldn't stop.</i>

609
01:17:19.159 --> 01:17:21.781
<i>It was my escape.</i>

610
01:17:21.822 --> 01:17:26.985
<i>Some people eat
when they get nervous.</i>


611
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:30.901
<i>At least, sex doesn't
make you fat.</i>


612
01:17:32.653 --> 01:17:37.018
<i>I liked jerking off
while I watched them.</i>


613
01:18:47.623 --> 01:18:51.117
Call if you feel like it.
- If I feel like it?


614
01:18:51.122 --> 01:18:52.950
If I can.

615
01:18:52.955 --> 01:18:55.282
What do you mean?

616
01:18:55.287 --> 01:18:58.614
I can't spend that much every day.

617
01:18:58.619 --> 01:19:03.487
If you like kinky sex
and can't afford it, speak to Remy.


618
01:19:03.492 --> 01:19:05.941
He's always at "Boy's".

619
01:19:05.946 --> 01:19:10.609
Who's Remy?
- He'll solve your problem.


620
01:20:12.256 --> 01:20:13.916
Is Remy in?

621
01:20:13.921 --> 01:20:18.866
I'll check.
Remy, someone to see you.


622
01:20:19.085 --> 01:20:21.661
Okay.

623
01:20:22.918 --> 01:20:25.490
Go ahead.

624
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:41.903
Who are you?
- Lulu.


625
01:20:41.908 --> 01:20:45.526
Are you Remy?
- Yeah. Sit down.


626
01:20:54.571 --> 01:20:56.899
I was told you'd help me.

627
01:20:56.904 --> 01:20:59.563
I help a lot of people.

628
01:20:59.568 --> 01:21:02.227
Come closer, baby.

629
01:21:03.235 --> 01:21:05.727
You need dough?

630
01:21:08.774 --> 01:21:10.560
Not exactly.

631
01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:15.307
Let me see you.
Stand back a little.


632
01:21:18.561 --> 01:21:21.433
Take off your jacket.

633
01:21:52.423 --> 01:21:57.036
You must do something.
Lulu's into some weird trip.


634
01:21:57.087 --> 01:21:59.582
What's new?

635
01:21:59.587 --> 01:22:03.665
Yeah, but it's serious
this time.


636
01:22:04.417 --> 01:22:07.079
She's taken up with
a guy...


637
01:22:07.084 --> 01:22:09.078
Remy.

638
01:22:09.083 --> 01:22:12.617
He's got a gay bar
and uses it as a cover.


639
01:22:12.622 --> 01:22:14.741
He's a real bastard.

640
01:22:14.746 --> 01:22:18.074
A pimp and he's done time.

641
01:22:18.079 --> 01:22:22.072
He's into S&M
with out-of-town freaks.


642
01:22:22.077 --> 01:22:25.066
And I mean real freaks.

643
01:22:25.075 --> 01:22:28.737
Have you told her
about the guy?


644
01:22:28.742 --> 01:22:31.978
She won't listen to me.

645
01:22:32.074 --> 01:22:37.277
Or to me. She
won't even speak to me.

646
01:22:38.402 --> 01:22:41.391
She's crazy about you.

647
01:22:50.608 --> 01:22:53.392
Find out more.

648
01:22:53.397 --> 01:22:55.853
Can you?

649
01:23:04.061 --> 01:23:06.388
Hi, how is it going?

650
01:23:06.393 --> 01:23:09.347
Badly.

651
01:23:09.558 --> 01:23:12.926
I want something special.

652
01:23:13.557 --> 01:23:16.384
I brought this guy with me.

653
01:23:16.389 --> 01:23:19.674
I've got to impress him.

654
01:23:21.386 --> 01:23:23.961
Anyone in mind?

655
01:23:24.052 --> 01:23:26.709
I think so.

656
01:23:28.382 --> 01:23:34.583
There's this pretty weird chick.
I think she could turn out real good.


657
01:23:36.381 --> 01:23:38.082
Lulu?

658
01:23:38.087 --> 01:23:43.205
This is Remy. How are you? I have
something you might be interested in.


659
01:23:43.210 --> 01:23:46.246
Everything under control?

660
01:23:47.918 --> 01:23:50.573
A Bourbon.

661
01:24:33.356 --> 01:24:37.188
You're really going
to enjoy this.


662
01:25:17.005 --> 01:25:18.667
Who are you?

663
01:25:18.672 --> 01:25:21.376
Remy sent me.

664
01:25:33.665 --> 01:25:36.371
Come in!

665
01:25:40.163 --> 01:25:42.869
Who is she?

666
01:25:43.495 --> 01:25:46.201
Come here.

667
01:25:46.992 --> 01:25:49.986
What's your name?
- Lulu.


668
01:25:49.991 --> 01:25:52.653
I know her.

669
01:25:52.658 --> 01:25:56.108
We know each other,
don't we?


670
01:25:58.823 --> 01:26:02.772
Where's the client?
- What client?


671
01:26:03.321 --> 01:26:06.394
You're new here, right?

672
01:26:57.174 --> 01:26:58.959
Like it?

673
01:26:58.964 --> 01:27:00.957
I'm scared.

674
01:27:00.962 --> 01:27:03.833
I've never been here before.

675
01:27:03.838 --> 01:27:05.954
I know, don't worry.

676
01:27:05.959 --> 01:27:08.916
We'll have a good time.

677
01:27:31.618 --> 01:27:34.193
What's that?

678
01:27:47.608 --> 01:27:50.268
Come on.

679
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:03.930
What's up?

680
01:28:04.771 --> 01:28:09.893
Where are we going?
- Next door to see the client.


681
01:28:12.101 --> 01:28:14.724
Drink up.

682
01:28:14.765 --> 01:28:19.177
I'm not drinking
and I'm going nowhere.


683
01:28:19.818 --> 01:28:23.729
You'll go
where I goddamn tell you.


684
01:28:30.314 --> 01:28:33.434
Relax...
Relax.


685
01:28:43.642 --> 01:28:45.803
How is it going, witch?

686
01:28:45.808 --> 01:28:48.513
Feel up to it?

687
01:28:57.136 --> 01:28:58.670
Tighten it.

688
01:28:58.675 --> 01:29:01.334
Don't scream.

689
01:29:01.468 --> 01:29:04.124
Like it?

690
01:29:12.295 --> 01:29:15.000
It's all for you.

691
01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:24.200
Let's have some music.

692
01:30:26.933 --> 01:30:32.718
You're gonna like this. Wait and see,
you'll beg me for more.


693
01:30:33.097 --> 01:30:36.051
I'm gonna fuck you good!

694
01:30:40.759 --> 01:30:43.755
What is it?
Why did you call me?


695
01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.421
Lulu's next door.

696
01:30:45.426 --> 01:30:47.420
She's in trouble.

697
01:30:47.425 --> 01:30:50.047
I'll fuck you!

698
01:30:51.087 --> 01:30:53.793
Slowly...

699
01:30:55.088 --> 01:30:59.367
You're gonna like it...
Sure you are...


700
01:30:59.584 --> 01:31:03.866
I'll stick it right inside.
Inside!


701
01:31:13.956 --> 01:31:17.239
Get going.
- I'm scared, Jimmy, I really am.


702
01:31:17.244 --> 01:31:20.234
Quit fucking around!

703
01:31:20.242 --> 01:31:23.199
Think about the dough.

704
01:31:52.729 --> 01:31:56.057
If I'm not back in

705
01:31:56.062 --> 01:32:00.177
I'm going with you.
- You're not, dammit!


706
01:32:25.051 --> 01:32:28.086
What are you doing here?

707
01:33:09.533 --> 01:33:15.693
Lay off, there isn't anyone here. This is
my house and I ain't letting you in.


708
01:33:15.698 --> 01:33:19.850
Fine. Just tell my friend
to come out here.


709
01:34:39.496 --> 01:34:44.989
Come back! Get out of my house!
- Let go of me or I'll kill you!


710
01:34:44.994 --> 01:34:47.197
Turn it off!

711
01:34:47.202 --> 01:34:49.488
Turn the music off!

712
01:34:49.493 --> 01:34:53.608
What the fuck's going on?
- Go and see.


713
01:34:56.987 --> 01:34:59.894
What the fuck...?

714
01:35:00.655 --> 01:35:03.937
Fucking fairy!
- Let go!


715
01:35:05.986 --> 01:35:09.310
Come on, faggot!

716
01:35:09.315 --> 01:35:11.974
I'll kill you!

717
01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:36.216
Another drink.

718
01:35:56.631 --> 01:35:58.793
You're going to kill him!

719
01:35:58.798 --> 01:36:01.252
Stop it!

720
01:36:02.627 --> 01:36:05.290
Stop it!
Have you lost your mind?


721
01:36:05.295 --> 01:36:07.289
You're gonna kill him!

722
01:36:07.294 --> 01:36:10.116
You're killing him!

723
01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:25.823
Police!
Come on!


724
01:36:25.828 --> 01:36:27.445
Against the wall!

725
01:36:27.450 --> 01:36:30.905
Let go!
- Cool it, bastard!


726
01:36:43.278 --> 01:36:45.686
You can't go in.

727
01:36:58.606 --> 01:37:00.765
Stand back.

728
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:04.224
I love you.
- Stand back.


729
01:37:08.936 --> 01:37:11.676
Help me...

730
01:37:14.473 --> 01:37:17.180
Help me!

731
01:37:26.759 --> 01:37:31.128
I love you.
I've always been happy...


732
01:37:31.133 --> 01:37:35.498
Pablo, I need you.
I need you.


733
01:37:36.924 --> 01:37:41.703
Help me!
