1
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.680
Hold your noise!

2
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.308
Hold your noise, you little devil,
or I'll cut your throat!


3
00:02:52.143 --> 00:02:54.186
- Tell us your, name! Quick!
- Pip!


4
00:02:54.186 --> 00:02:55.688
- Once more! Give it mouth!
- Pip!


5
00:02:55.688 --> 00:02:58.816
- Shh!
- Pip, sir! No, sir, please.


6
00:02:58.816 --> 00:03:01.152
Got wittles on you, boy?
You got wittles on you?


7
00:03:01.152 --> 00:03:02.153
No, sir!

8
00:03:03.195 --> 00:03:04.538
Come here.

9
00:03:05.364 --> 00:03:07.082
What fat cheeks you got.

10
00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.832
Darn me if I couldn't eat 'em.

11
00:03:10.037 --> 00:03:11.289
Where's your mother?

12
00:03:11.414 --> 00:03:13.708
There, sir!

13
00:03:13.708 --> 00:03:14.755
Also Georgiana, sir.

14
00:03:15.084 --> 00:03:17.007
My mother and brothers too.

15
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.513
Orphan, eh?

16
00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.882
Who d'you live with?
Supposin' I let you live.


17
00:03:20.882 --> 00:03:26.013
My sister, sir, Mrs Joe Gargery,
wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith.


18
00:03:26.137 --> 00:03:27.684
Blacksmith, eh?

19
00:03:28.806 --> 00:03:29.898
You know what a file is?

20
00:03:30.183 --> 00:03:32.277
- You know what wittles is?
- Yes, sir, food, sir.


21
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:35.946
I ain't alone, as
you may think I am.

22
00:03:36.022 --> 00:03:40.323
There's a young man hid with me in
comparison with which I am an angel,


23
00:03:40.485 --> 00:03:42.613
and he has a secret way
of getting at a boy,


24
00:03:42.695 --> 00:03:46.541
and at his heart, and at his liver,
so that they may be roasted and ate.


25
00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.795
It is in vain for a boy to hide
from that young man.


26
00:03:50.287 --> 00:03:54.208
Now, you bring me tomorrow morning early,
in this graveyard,


27
00:03:54.208 --> 00:03:59.636
that file and them wittles,
never daring to say a word,


28
00:03:59.714 --> 00:04:03.885
and I will do what I can to keep
that young man out of your insides.


29
00:04:03.885 --> 00:04:05.307
Understand?

30
00:04:05.386 --> 00:04:06.888
- Speak it out!
- Yes, sir!


31
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:08.598
Now get you home.

32
00:04:38.462 --> 00:04:39.930
There you are, Pip!

33
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.303
Ah, Your sister's been out
a dozen times looking for you.


34
00:04:42.383 --> 00:04:45.934
Now, listen, she's on the rampage
and she's got Tickler with her.


35
00:04:46.596 --> 00:04:50.396
Now, I'll do what I can but you best
get in there behind the door.


36
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.318
- Now... You ready?
- Where have you been?


37
00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.697
Wearing me out with fret and worry!

38
00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:57.782
I said, "Where have you been?"

39
00:04:57.858 --> 00:04:59.781
- The churchyard.
- The churchyard!


40
00:05:00.068 --> 00:05:03.288
If it weren't for me you would've been
to the churchyard years ago, and stayed there!


41
00:05:03.363 --> 00:05:05.615
- Who brought you up by hand?
- You did!


42
00:05:05.615 --> 00:05:06.958
Why did I, I should like to know!

43
00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:08.706
Fetch the tar water!

44
00:05:08.785 --> 00:05:10.453
There's no need for tar water, my love.
It's Christmas.


45
00:05:10.453 --> 00:05:11.750
Fetch it!

46
00:05:12.123 --> 00:05:16.219
Bad enough having to be a blacksmith's
wife, without having to mother you, too.


47
00:05:16.836 --> 00:05:19.964
- You're driving me to the churchyard.
- You all right?


48
00:05:19.964 --> 00:05:21.136
You'd like that, both of you, I suppose.

49
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:24.560
Tar water. You be careful.

50
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.597
Table! Now!

51
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.859
There's another convict
escaped from the Hulks.


52
00:05:36.148 --> 00:05:38.191
What might he have done, the convict?

53
00:05:38.191 --> 00:05:39.317
Murder most likely.

54
00:05:39.985 --> 00:05:42.704
That's why they put them in the Hulks,
because they murder.


55
00:05:42.988 --> 00:05:44.364
- Murder?
- Murder and robbing.


56
00:05:44.364 --> 00:05:46.162
That's too many questions!

57
00:05:47.367 --> 00:05:48.539
Where's that bread gone?

58
00:05:51.663 --> 00:05:52.664
I ate it.

59
00:05:55.168 --> 00:05:56.670
You did, did you?

60
00:07:06.117 --> 00:07:07.869
Sir. Sir...

61
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:49.456
Did you bring it, boy?

62
00:07:50.454 --> 00:07:52.128
Yes, sir. Here.

63
00:07:54.751 --> 00:07:55.798
What's in the bottle?

64
00:07:56.753 --> 00:07:59.633
- Brandy.
- Here. Here.


65
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.074
- You brought no-one with you?
- No, sir!


66
00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:19.902
- And you asked no-one to follow?
- I wouldn't do that, sir.


67
00:08:25.866 --> 00:08:26.958
I'm glad you enjoy the pie.

68
00:08:27.076 --> 00:08:30.000
Oh, thankee, my boy, I do. I do.

69
00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:33.207
- There'll be none left for him!
-"Him"?


70
00:08:33.207 --> 00:08:35.876
- Who's "him"?
- The young man you spoke of.


71
00:08:35.876 --> 00:08:36.877
Who wants to eat my liver.

72
00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:40.342
Oh, him.

73
00:08:41.175 --> 00:08:43.678
He won't want no pie.

74
00:08:45.179 --> 00:08:46.271
He looked as if he did.

75
00:08:47.848 --> 00:08:49.145
Looked? What d'you mean, looked?

76
00:08:49.892 --> 00:08:50.984
I saw him.

77
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.403
- When?
- Just now.


78
00:08:52.645 --> 00:08:54.773
- Where?
- Down by the river.


79
00:08:54.855 --> 00:08:57.233
What with...
Dressed like me with a bruised face?


80
00:08:57.233 --> 00:08:59.068
- Here? Badly bruised?
- Yes, sir.


81
00:08:59.068 --> 00:09:00.945
Give me the file, boy!

82
00:09:04.406 --> 00:09:06.750
Hunt him down like a dog I will.

83
00:09:07.243 --> 00:09:09.086
- Goodbye, then, sir.
- Let him go free?


84
00:09:09.203 --> 00:09:10.375
Merry Christmas, sir.

85
00:09:10.579 --> 00:09:13.628
- Let him make a fool of me again?
- Goodbye.


86
00:09:13.707 --> 00:09:17.302
That villain. I'll take him
to the bottom of the river...


87
00:09:19.463 --> 00:09:22.718
<i>I On Christmas day,
on Christmas day<i></i></i>


88
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:24.895
<i>I And ail the souls on
earth shalt sing<i></i></i>


89
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.440
<i>On Christmas day in the morning<i></i></i>

90
00:09:27.557 --> 00:09:29.776
<i>Then let us all rejoice and sing<i></i></i>

91
00:09:29.851 --> 00:09:32.400
<i>On Christmas day,
on Christmas day<i></i></i>


92
00:09:34.522 --> 00:09:35.523
Beautiful.

93
00:09:41.237 --> 00:09:44.207
A beautiful piece of meat, that is.

94
00:09:45.199 --> 00:09:47.497
For the great feast
we are about to receive,


95
00:09:47.994 --> 00:09:49.917
- Thanks to you, ma'am...
- Hear, hear.


96
00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:53.174
May the good Lord
make us truly thankful.


97
00:09:53.332 --> 00:09:55.630
- Amen.
- Amen.


98
00:09:55.751 --> 00:09:57.173
Did you hear that? Be grateful!

99
00:09:57.253 --> 00:10:00.723
Especially, my boy, as to those
what brought you up by hand.


100
00:10:01.048 --> 00:10:03.768
Why is it that the young
are never grateful?


101
00:10:05.304 --> 00:10:08.683
- Naturally wicious!
- Wicious little ferret.


102
00:10:08.765 --> 00:10:10.108
What?

103
00:10:10.184 --> 00:10:11.606
They're not lovely. 
They're wicious.

104
00:10:11.685 --> 00:10:13.438
More gravy, Mr Wopsle?

105
00:10:16.691 --> 00:10:17.738
Mmm-hmm.

106
00:10:18.776 --> 00:10:19.777
<i>Mmm.</i>

107
00:10:21.112 --> 00:10:22.910
Oh, I nearly forgot!

108
00:10:23.615 --> 00:10:27.495
Ladies and gentlemen, please do leave
a little room for the savoury pork pie


109
00:10:27.952 --> 00:10:30.705
so kindly provided for
by dear Mr Pumblechook.


110
00:10:30.788 --> 00:10:33.666
No more than you deserve, ma'am.

111
00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:35.634
I'll get it now.
Shall I get it now?


112
00:10:36.461 --> 00:10:38.054
I'll get it now.

113
00:10:38.129 --> 00:10:41.008
I often say a slice
of savoury pork pie


114
00:10:41.299 --> 00:10:42.516
will sit on top of anything
you care to mention...


115
00:10:42.592 --> 00:10:43.764
Are you all right?

116
00:10:43.885 --> 00:10:45.183
...and do no harm.

117
00:10:45.638 --> 00:10:47.060
Especially with a little brandy.

118
00:10:47.473 --> 00:10:49.146
Wise words, as always.

119
00:10:49.308 --> 00:10:50.901
It's in here somewhere.

120
00:10:51.143 --> 00:10:52.816
At least it was here. It's gone!

121
00:10:57.274 --> 00:10:58.821
There's tar water in the brandy!

122
00:10:59.026 --> 00:11:00.028
Pip!

123
00:11:01.988 --> 00:11:03.285
Where do you think
you're going, boy?


124
00:11:06.993 --> 00:11:08.536
Oh, that is hot, yeah.

125
00:11:08.536 --> 00:11:09.879
Well done, blacksmith. Well done.

126
00:11:12.707 --> 00:11:14.709
Nasty vicious characters, both of them.

127
00:11:14.834 --> 00:11:16.836
Not the kind you'd want to
stumble upon alone, eh?


128
00:11:16.836 --> 00:11:18.804
Anybody here seen anything of
such a gang?


129
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.632
- Nothing, Sergeant.
- Thank you, ma'am.


130
00:11:22.842 --> 00:11:24.185
Your health, sir.

131
00:11:24.469 --> 00:11:27.064
- Thank you, sir.
- A fine job.


132
00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:29.562
We found them filed clean through.

133
00:11:29.684 --> 00:11:33.029
But no matter. We'll have
'em back on him in no time.


134
00:11:33.771 --> 00:11:36.775
Course, if any of you gentlemen
fancy some sport...


135
00:11:37.275 --> 00:11:38.401
- Oh, yes.
- Willingly.


136
00:11:38.484 --> 00:11:40.236
Right, outside. Fall in.

137
00:11:40.319 --> 00:11:41.696
Jump to it.

138
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.731
Come on, let's be having you.

139
00:11:43.739 --> 00:11:45.412
Out you come, Pip.

140
00:11:55.294 --> 00:11:57.046
I hope we don't find 'em, Joe.

141
00:11:57.129 --> 00:11:58.346
I hope so too, old chap.

142
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.132
I hope so too.

143
00:12:12.562 --> 00:12:15.361
Over here, Sergeant!

144
00:12:16.149 --> 00:12:17.492
Come here!

145
00:12:20.194 --> 00:12:22.367
You, man, break it off.

146
00:12:23.573 --> 00:12:25.075
Break it off.

147
00:12:25.825 --> 00:12:26.917
Get them. Go.

148
00:12:28.119 --> 00:12:30.417
Get out there, you cowardly bastard.

149
00:12:30.496 --> 00:12:31.873
Move. Move.

150
00:12:33.291 --> 00:12:34.293
I've got him!

151
00:12:34.918 --> 00:12:37.512
Break it off! Break it off!

152
00:12:39.173 --> 00:12:41.426
What are you waiting for? 
Get out there!

153
00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:44.011
Go on, get in!

154
00:12:47.973 --> 00:12:49.692
Let me at him!

155
00:12:50.268 --> 00:12:51.436
Let me at him!

156
00:12:51.436 --> 00:12:52.608
He tried to murder me!

157
00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:58.651
- I took him!
- Get those leg irons over here.


158
00:12:58.651 --> 00:13:00.278
He tried to murder me!

159
00:13:00.278 --> 00:13:03.327
Let him go free?
Let him profit from me again and again?


160
00:13:03.406 --> 00:13:04.532
Let's put him down.

161
00:13:04.616 --> 00:13:07.620
- He tried to murder me!
- Quiet, you!


162
00:13:07.702 --> 00:13:09.955
I should have been a dead man,
if you hadn't got here.


163
00:13:16.127 --> 00:13:17.549
I wish to say something.

164
00:13:18.171 --> 00:13:20.800
- A confession if you like.
- Wait.


165
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.301
Go on.

166
00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:24.349
A man can't starve.

167
00:13:24.428 --> 00:13:28.023
I took, stole, some wittles
up at the village.


168
00:13:28.432 --> 00:13:29.979
And a file too.

169
00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:31.565
And I'll tell you from where.

170
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.147
The blacksmith's.

171
00:13:34.231 --> 00:13:36.029
Brandy and a pie.

172
00:13:36.108 --> 00:13:38.360
Have you missed such an article as a pie,
blacksmith?


173
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.614
- My wife did.
- So you're the blacksmith, are you?


174
00:13:42.823 --> 00:13:45.576
Then I'm sorry to
say I've eat your pie.

175
00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:47.828
God knows you're welcome to it.

176
00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:50.171
We don't know what you've done,

177
00:13:50.247 --> 00:13:53.842
but we wouldn't wish you to starve
to death for it, would us, Pip?


178
00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:55.840
No.

179
00:13:57.963 --> 00:13:59.010
Pip?

180
00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:00.925
Move on!

181
00:14:11.937 --> 00:14:13.439
Swing your legs in there.

182
00:14:44.887 --> 00:14:46.480
I say, Pip, old chap!

183
00:14:46.555 --> 00:14:48.148
What a scholar you are!

184
00:14:48.223 --> 00:14:50.559
I should like to be, some day.

185
00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:51.651
Here, read it, Joe.

186
00:14:53.938 --> 00:14:55.191
Read it.

187
00:14:57.067 --> 00:14:58.284
Read it.

188
00:15:05.201 --> 00:15:07.953
My dear Joe,

189
00:15:07.953 --> 00:15:11.753
I hope you are quite well.

190
00:15:12.082 --> 00:15:16.758
I shall soon be able
to teach you Joe.


191
00:15:17.713 --> 00:15:19.761
- And what larks!
- Larks.


192
00:15:20.716 --> 00:15:21.968
It's a J.

193
00:15:22.635 --> 00:15:23.761
An O.

194
00:15:23.886 --> 00:15:26.480
That's the best O
I ever saw.


195
00:15:26.597 --> 00:15:28.850
It's astonishing!

196
00:15:28.933 --> 00:15:30.606
How interesting this reading is!

197
00:15:31.018 --> 00:15:33.103
Perhaps I could teach
you one day, Joe.


198
00:15:33.103 --> 00:15:34.355
Perhaps.

199
00:15:35.857 --> 00:15:37.651
Be it so, be it so.

200
00:15:37.651 --> 00:15:41.622
But I fear I am most awful...
Awful... Dull.


201
00:15:43.157 --> 00:15:46.161
Not like you, young scholar!

202
00:15:51.624 --> 00:15:54.298
Ever the best of friends.
Thanks, Pip.


203
00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.962
Ever the best of friends, Joe.

204
00:15:56.128 --> 00:15:59.507
And when you're apprenticed to me,
what larks.


205
00:16:00.675 --> 00:16:02.097
Gargery!

206
00:16:03.636 --> 00:16:07.561
She must be, what, two mile off?

207
00:16:09.308 --> 00:16:11.151
Gargery!

208
00:16:11.477 --> 00:16:12.899
Best be getting back, old chap.

209
00:16:19.319 --> 00:16:21.663
You're not too quick for me yet.

210
00:16:21.738 --> 00:16:24.617
<i>Now, if this boy ain't grateful,
he never will be.</i>


211
00:16:25.534 --> 00:16:26.877
I only hope he won't be pampered.

212
00:16:27.494 --> 00:16:29.338
She ain't in that line, Mum,
have no fear.


213
00:16:29.581 --> 00:16:31.709
- "She"?
- Well, Miss Havisham ain't a he, is she?


214
00:16:31.833 --> 00:16:33.255
<i>Even you ain't as dull as that!</i>

215
00:16:33.376 --> 00:16:35.128
Well put, ma'am. Good indeed.

216
00:16:35.336 --> 00:16:37.555
- Mr Pumblechook...
- Her tenant, don't you see?


217
00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.600
...goes to pay his rent
and Miss Havisham says,


218
00:16:40.675 --> 00:16:43.770
does he know a boy who might go
and play there for her pleasure?


219
00:16:44.095 --> 00:16:48.225
And Mr Pumblechook always being
considerate and thoughtful of us...


220
00:16:48.308 --> 00:16:49.605
No more than you deserve, ma'am.

221
00:16:49.684 --> 00:16:51.686
...mentions this boy prancing here.

222
00:16:52.228 --> 00:16:53.525
To go straightaway!

223
00:16:53.688 --> 00:16:56.862
For all we know our fortune might be made
and all he has to do is play!


224
00:16:56.941 --> 00:16:57.943
I don't want to.

225
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.613
You listen to me,
ungrateful wretch.


226
00:17:00.696 --> 00:17:02.539
Want to mix with people
of quality and breeding


227
00:17:02.823 --> 00:17:06.043
or stay here and rot
with this great lumpen noodle?


228
00:17:08.537 --> 00:17:09.880
- Stay here.
- What?


229
00:17:11.582 --> 00:17:12.799
What?

230
00:17:19.382 --> 00:17:20.679
Breathe in. Breathe.

231
00:17:26.514 --> 00:17:27.857
Six sixes.

232
00:17:28.767 --> 00:17:30.560
36.

233
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.734
- Minus 35.
- One.


234
00:17:34.397 --> 00:17:35.694
Plus 119.

235
00:17:36.358 --> 00:17:37.530
119...

236
00:17:38.401 --> 00:17:39.745
Um, 120.

237
00:17:40.529 --> 00:17:42.031
Divided by 84.

238
00:17:43.908 --> 00:17:45.455
Your answer, please, boy.
Your answer.


239
00:17:46.577 --> 00:17:48.124
So start again.

240
00:17:49.038 --> 00:17:51.587
12 times 39.

241
00:18:03.387 --> 00:18:04.434
<i>Four times 17.</i>

242
00:18:05.263 --> 00:18:06.765
Too slow 68.

243
00:18:07.015 --> 00:18:08.062
Nine times 13.

244
00:18:09.559 --> 00:18:11.186
117.

245
00:18:18.944 --> 00:18:21.789
Now, boy, remember your station

246
00:18:21.989 --> 00:18:25.289
and let your conduct be a credit as to
those which brought you up by hand.


247
00:18:25.576 --> 00:18:27.795
Ow!

248
00:18:29.872 --> 00:18:32.216
- Look, the clock's stopped.
- Never mind the clock...


249
00:18:53.105 --> 00:18:55.315
- What name?
- Pumblechook.


250
00:18:55.315 --> 00:18:56.362
Quite right.

251
00:18:56.984 --> 00:18:58.486
Do you wish to see Miss Havisham?

252
00:18:59.528 --> 00:19:02.122
- Well, if Miss Havisham wishes to see me!
- She don't.


253
00:19:02.866 --> 00:19:04.493
Come along, boy.

254
00:19:04.659 --> 00:19:05.706
Boy!

255
00:19:23.595 --> 00:19:25.347
Are you frightened?

256
00:19:26.389 --> 00:19:27.891
I don't know.

257
00:19:32.937 --> 00:19:34.359
Go in, then.

258
00:19:35.356 --> 00:19:36.904
After you, miss.

259
00:20:12.687 --> 00:20:14.030
Who is it?

260
00:20:15.565 --> 00:20:16.657
Pip, ma'am.

261
00:20:18.568 --> 00:20:19.615
Pip?

262
00:20:19.736 --> 00:20:23.708
Pumblechook's boy,
come to, uh, play.


263
00:20:24.575 --> 00:20:25.623
Oh.

264
00:20:27.454 --> 00:20:29.127
Ah, yes.
Um...


265
00:20:30.332 --> 00:20:31.584
Come nearer.

266
00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:33.255
Let me look at you.

267
00:20:39.758 --> 00:20:40.759
Look at me!

268
00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.939
You're not afraid of a woman who's
never seen the sun since you were born?


269
00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:48.942
No, ma'am.

270
00:20:49.643 --> 00:20:51.270
Then come closer.

271
00:20:54.857 --> 00:20:55.858
Hmm.

272
00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:10.132
Now, I sometimes have sick fancies.

273
00:21:10.456 --> 00:21:14.963
And, um, I have a sick fancy
that I want to see some play.


274
00:21:15.421 --> 00:21:17.515
Um, so play.

275
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:18.887
Go on, play.

276
00:21:18.966 --> 00:21:20.058
Play.

277
00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.314
- Are you sullen and obstinate?
- No, ma'am!


278
00:21:25.514 --> 00:21:28.684
I am very sorry for you
and sorry that I can't play.


279
00:21:28.684 --> 00:21:33.155
But if you complain of me
I will get into trouble with my sister,


280
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:36.825
so I would play if I could,
but it's just so new here.


281
00:21:37.192 --> 00:21:39.160
Call Estella! Estella!

282
00:21:39.862 --> 00:21:41.114
Estella!

283
00:21:47.077 --> 00:21:48.078
<i>Mmm.</i>

284
00:21:53.376 --> 00:21:58.258
Your own one day, my dear,
and you will use it well.


285
00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.013
Now. Let me see you
play cards with him.


286
00:22:04.972 --> 00:22:07.191
But he's a common labouring boy.

287
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:09.352
You can break his heart.

288
00:22:11.187 --> 00:22:12.484
What do you play, boy?

289
00:22:13.189 --> 00:22:15.733
Nothing but,
"Beggar My Neighbour", miss.


290
00:22:15.733 --> 00:22:17.201
So...

291
00:22:17.735 --> 00:22:18.782
Beggar him.

292
00:22:36.546 --> 00:22:38.640
- The jack of diamonds.
- "Jack"!


293
00:22:39.007 --> 00:22:40.850
He calls the knaves "jack", this boy.

294
00:22:42.552 --> 00:22:44.054
And what coarse hands he has,

295
00:22:45.848 --> 00:22:46.895
and what thick boots.

296
00:22:48.226 --> 00:22:51.571
He's nothing but a stupid,
clumsy labouring boy.


297
00:22:55.233 --> 00:22:56.234
What do you think of her?

298
00:22:57.151 --> 00:22:59.074
You say nothing of her.

299
00:23:00.238 --> 00:23:01.990
I don't like to say.

300
00:23:02.949 --> 00:23:04.622
Whisper in my ear.

301
00:23:08.746 --> 00:23:09.747
Hm.

302
00:23:10.248 --> 00:23:11.922
What do you think?

303
00:23:12.334 --> 00:23:14.678
I think she is very proud.

304
00:23:15.629 --> 00:23:16.846
Anything else?

305
00:23:16.922 --> 00:23:17.923
I think...

306
00:23:19.758 --> 00:23:21.101
I think she is very pretty.

307
00:23:22.094 --> 00:23:23.595
Anything else?

308
00:23:23.595 --> 00:23:26.815
I think she is very insulting.

309
00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:30.436
I think I should like to go home.

310
00:23:31.688 --> 00:23:32.780
What?

311
00:23:33.189 --> 00:23:34.657
And never see her again?

312
00:23:35.275 --> 00:23:36.447
I think I'd like to see her again.

313
00:23:37.527 --> 00:23:39.074
Then you shall.

314
00:23:41.281 --> 00:23:42.783
Then you shall.

315
00:23:44.451 --> 00:23:46.795
But when, when shall I
have you here again?


316
00:23:47.454 --> 00:23:48.455
Today is Wednesday.

317
00:23:48.538 --> 00:23:49.960
No Wednesdays, Thursdays,
Fridays here,


318
00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.542
no days of the week,
no weeks of the year.


319
00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:57.511
No... Come again after 6 nights.

320
00:23:58.299 --> 00:23:59.801
Estella, take him down.

321
00:24:00.551 --> 00:24:01.552
Feed him.

322
00:24:19.488 --> 00:24:21.991
"And the Lord said unto... Unto...

323
00:24:22.074 --> 00:24:24.577
"...unto Aaron,

324
00:24:24.659 --> 00:24:29.506
"Thou and thy sons
and thy father's house..."


325
00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.172
Good gracious, what is going on?

326
00:24:36.255 --> 00:24:38.132
Enough! Enough, I say!

327
00:24:38.966 --> 00:24:40.843
Back to your form, Pip.

328
00:24:45.598 --> 00:24:48.021
Now, let us read together.

329
00:24:49.102 --> 00:24:50.354
Quietly.

330
00:24:51.187 --> 00:24:53.906
"And the Lord said

331
00:24:53.981 --> 00:24:57.193
"unto Aaron...

332
00:24:57.193 --> 00:25:00.242
"...Thou and thy sons..."

333
00:25:04.242 --> 00:25:06.371
I wonder if you might teach me.

334
00:25:06.495 --> 00:25:08.122
Teach you what, Pip?

335
00:25:08.205 --> 00:25:09.422
Everything-

336
00:25:09.498 --> 00:25:11.717
I want to know everything.

337
00:25:12.167 --> 00:25:13.544
Everything?

338
00:25:14.336 --> 00:25:19.218
Goodness, well,
that might take a little time.


339
00:25:20.051 --> 00:25:21.394
Pip, whatever for?

340
00:25:22.595 --> 00:25:25.098
Do you know the name
of the house, boy?


341
00:25:25.306 --> 00:25:26.979
It is Satis House.

342
00:25:27.684 --> 00:25:30.563
Is that Greek or Latin?

343
00:25:30.645 --> 00:25:35.742
Greek or Latin or Hebrew or all three,
for "enough".


344
00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.570
Enough House. That's a curious name.

345
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.113
Don't loiter!

346
00:25:40.113 --> 00:25:43.617
It meant, when it was given,
that whoever had this house


347
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.418
would want for nothing else.

348
00:25:46.411 --> 00:25:49.039
They must have been easily satisfied.

349
00:25:51.499 --> 00:25:53.460
Is this him? Is this the boy?

350
00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.679
- None of your business.
- Well! Of all the...


351
00:25:55.754 --> 00:25:57.928
Will she see us today?
We have been waiting!


352
00:25:58.258 --> 00:26:00.761
- Waiting all morning!
- Waiting all morning!


353
00:26:00.844 --> 00:26:02.721
- We only wish to help.
- We only wish to help.


354
00:26:03.555 --> 00:26:05.398
Miss Havishams poor relations.

355
00:26:05.807 --> 00:26:07.024
She calls them her vultures.

356
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.273
- The little bitch.
- Ignore them.


357
00:26:12.272 --> 00:26:14.616
- So are they your relations too?
- Certainly not.


358
00:26:15.108 --> 00:26:16.906
I have no relations.

359
00:26:17.194 --> 00:26:18.946
- Then Miss Havisham is not your...
- Well?


360
00:26:20.197 --> 00:26:22.416
- Well, miss?
- Am I pretty?


361
00:26:23.074 --> 00:26:25.623
Yes. You are very pretty.

362
00:26:29.206 --> 00:26:30.879
Am I insulting?

363
00:26:30.957 --> 00:26:31.958
No.

364
00:26:32.626 --> 00:26:35.095
<i>Well, not so much as last time.</i>

365
00:26:35.962 --> 00:26:38.306
Why don't you cry?

366
00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.348
Because I don't want to.

367
00:26:40.636 --> 00:26:42.309
Whom have we here?

368
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:46.479
Ah. So you're the boy, are you?

369
00:26:46.975 --> 00:26:52.197
Well, I have a pretty large experience of
boys, and you're a bad set of fellows.


370
00:26:52.272 --> 00:26:53.865
Behave yourself.

371
00:26:55.651 --> 00:26:58.154
You're to wait here in the ballroom.

372
00:27:06.495 --> 00:27:07.587
What do you think it is?

373
00:27:09.456 --> 00:27:10.673
A cake.

374
00:27:11.458 --> 00:27:13.005
A bride's cake.

375
00:27:13.418 --> 00:27:14.510
Mine!

376
00:27:16.964 --> 00:27:19.058
Take my hand, walk with me.

377
00:27:23.012 --> 00:27:24.559
Today is my birthday.

378
00:27:25.473 --> 00:27:27.818
- Many happy ret...
- I will not have it spoken of!


379
00:27:29.603 --> 00:27:33.733
No. On this day of the year,
long before you were born,


380
00:27:34.608 --> 00:27:36.451
this heap of decay was brought here...

381
00:27:37.319 --> 00:27:39.321
We've worn away together.

382
00:27:39.655 --> 00:27:41.407
Mice have gnawed at it.

383
00:27:41.407 --> 00:27:43.535
And sharper teeth than mice
have gnawed at me.


384
00:27:46.203 --> 00:27:48.251
When the ruin is complete,

385
00:27:48.539 --> 00:27:52.260
when they lay me dead
in my bride's dress,


386
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.508
on the bride's table,

387
00:27:54.628 --> 00:27:56.380
the curse will be finished on him.

388
00:27:56.964 --> 00:27:58.716
On who, Miss Havisham?

389
00:28:00.342 --> 00:28:03.096
Miss Havisham. 
How well you look!

390
00:28:03.096 --> 00:28:04.723
- Happy birthday.
- Indeed.


391
00:28:06.433 --> 00:28:09.277
Ah, the vultures.

392
00:28:10.854 --> 00:28:13.574
Estella, feed the boy.

393
00:29:04.118 --> 00:29:07.292
Who are you?
Who let you in?


394
00:29:07.372 --> 00:29:09.170
Who gave you leave to prowl about?

395
00:29:09.624 --> 00:29:10.625
Estella.

396
00:29:10.708 --> 00:29:11.709
Estella?

397
00:29:11.918 --> 00:29:12.965
That witch!

398
00:29:13.544 --> 00:29:15.171
- Take that back!
- I will not!


399
00:29:15.254 --> 00:29:17.677
- You will take that back.
- Fight me, then.


400
00:29:18.257 --> 00:29:19.258
Regular rules.

401
00:29:19.592 --> 00:29:21.310
Come to the ground!

402
00:29:37.361 --> 00:29:38.362
Fight me, fight me.

403
00:29:50.125 --> 00:29:51.342
That means you won.

404
00:29:51.459 --> 00:29:54.554
Honour is satisfied. Much obliged.
Good afternoon!


405
00:30:03.555 --> 00:30:08.107
You are to return the day after tomorrow
at noon, alternate days after that.


406
00:30:09.311 --> 00:30:10.938
Expect no reward.

407
00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:16.244
You may kiss me.

408
00:30:16.318 --> 00:30:17.695
If you like.

409
00:30:46.266 --> 00:30:48.190
<i>Now, then,
the Kings of England.</i>


410
00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:51.068
- Henry III, Richard...
- Edward I.


411
00:30:51.147 --> 00:30:54.742
- Edward I.
- II and III.


412
00:30:54.859 --> 00:30:56.907
- Richard.
- Richard the...


413
00:30:57.028 --> 00:30:58.826
- Richard II.
- Henry the...


414
00:30:58.905 --> 00:31:00.657
How do you manage it, Biddy?

415
00:31:00.865 --> 00:31:04.452
- Manage what?
- To know so much.


416
00:31:04.452 --> 00:31:07.331
I suppose I catch it.

417
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.548
Like a cough.

418
00:31:10.583 --> 00:31:13.257
<i>Mnmum</i>

419
00:31:13.961 --> 00:31:17.465
<i>Old Clem, beat it out,
beat I! out<i></i></i>


420
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:21.015
<i>Old Clem,
with a clink for the stout<i></i></i>


421
00:31:21.093 --> 00:31:22.971
<i>Old Clem, with a...<i></i></i>

422
00:31:22.971 --> 00:31:24.139
Something wrong, old chap?

423
00:31:24.139 --> 00:31:26.892
I wish you hadn't taught me
to call knaves jacks.


424
00:31:27.643 --> 00:31:28.690
What's that, Pip?

425
00:31:28.769 --> 00:31:32.400
I wish my boots weren't so thick and my
hands so coarse. I wish I wasn't common!


426
00:31:35.193 --> 00:31:38.117
<i>- May I ref! you a secret?
- I suppose you may.</i>


427
00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:43.786
I don't...
I don't want to be a blacksmith.


428
00:31:45.036 --> 00:31:46.288
I want to be a gentleman.

429
00:31:47.121 --> 00:31:49.465
Oh, I wouldn't if I was you.

430
00:31:49.666 --> 00:31:51.464
Aren't you fond of the forge?

431
00:31:51.543 --> 00:31:52.715
- And Joe?
- Yes.


432
00:31:52.794 --> 00:31:55.672
Then don't you think
you'd be happier as you are?


433
00:31:55.672 --> 00:31:58.095
I have particular reasons.

434
00:31:58.883 --> 00:32:02.638
To do with a certain young lady,
I suppose.


435
00:32:03.638 --> 00:32:05.106
Your princess.

436
00:32:05.765 --> 00:32:08.359
1, 2, 3, 4.

437
00:32:08.644 --> 00:32:11.148
1, 2, 3, 4.

438
00:32:18.613 --> 00:32:21.332
1, 2, 3, 4.

439
00:32:21.449 --> 00:32:24.123
1, 2, 3, 4.

440
00:32:32.877 --> 00:32:34.925
1, 2, 3...

441
00:32:35.171 --> 00:32:36.388
Estella.

442
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:39.301
What are you doing?

443
00:32:39.801 --> 00:32:42.020
Teaching Pip to dance.

444
00:32:42.095 --> 00:32:43.722
Like a gentleman.

445
00:32:48.184 --> 00:32:49.777
Bring the blacksmith to see me.

446
00:33:01.867 --> 00:33:02.959
Joe.

447
00:33:18.592 --> 00:33:19.639
Oh.

448
00:33:20.177 --> 00:33:23.181
So you are the husband
of the sister of the boy?


449
00:33:26.475 --> 00:33:28.268
Being that I have been married
to your sister...


450
00:33:28.268 --> 00:33:29.315
Just say yes, Joe.

451
00:33:29.394 --> 00:33:31.567
- By which I mean to say...
- Joe.


452
00:33:31.647 --> 00:33:33.399
Yes, Miss Havisham.

453
00:33:33.815 --> 00:33:38.242
And you have reared the boy with the
intention of making him your apprentice?


454
00:33:40.239 --> 00:33:42.743
You know, Pip, as you and I
ever were the best of friends,


455
00:33:43.243 --> 00:33:47.840
and it were look fofiard to betwixt us
as being calculated to lead to larks.


456
00:33:54.672 --> 00:33:57.596
The boy has made no objection
to the trade?


457
00:33:58.175 --> 00:33:59.635
Larks being the great
wish of his heart.


458
00:33:59.635 --> 00:34:00.761
Oh, enough! Estella.

459
00:34:01.095 --> 00:34:02.847
Um, bring me that purse.

460
00:34:05.808 --> 00:34:06.934
Yes, um...

461
00:34:07.685 --> 00:34:10.029
Pip has earnt a premium here.

462
00:34:10.896 --> 00:34:12.614
Here are 5 and 20 guineas.

463
00:34:13.691 --> 00:34:14.863
Give it to your new master, Pip.

464
00:34:23.451 --> 00:34:24.668
Now...

465
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:27.338
You are now a blacksmith.

466
00:34:27.414 --> 00:34:28.711
Goodbye.

467
00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:36.632
You are not ashamed
of being a blacksmith, are you?


468
00:34:37.133 --> 00:34:38.134
No.

469
00:34:38.676 --> 00:34:40.428
Then you are a blacksmith.

470
00:34:40.636 --> 00:34:41.637
Goodbye.

471
00:34:42.972 --> 00:34:44.348
But...

472
00:34:44.348 --> 00:34:45.816
Am I to come again?

473
00:34:47.435 --> 00:34:50.063
No.
Goodbye, Pip.


474
00:34:50.146 --> 00:34:51.568
You have been a good boy.

475
00:34:52.189 --> 00:34:54.487
Goodbye. Goodbye.

476
00:35:00.157 --> 00:35:02.000
Come on. Let's go.

477
00:35:16.632 --> 00:35:20.682
Perhaps we shall meet again.
One day.


478
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:26.063
It seems unlikely.

479
00:35:33.399 --> 00:35:35.367
Pip. Pip.

480
00:35:36.861 --> 00:35:38.329
Come on, boy.

481
00:36:25.246 --> 00:36:26.293
Pip.

482
00:36:26.705 --> 00:36:27.831
<i>Joe, may I?</i>

483
00:37:30.313 --> 00:37:31.986
Biddy, I wish...

484
00:37:33.524 --> 00:37:34.696
Go on.

485
00:37:35.192 --> 00:37:36.284
Pip?

486
00:37:41.408 --> 00:37:43.206
Biddy, I wish I could
fall in love with you.


487
00:37:44.162 --> 00:37:45.663
Oh.

488
00:37:45.663 --> 00:37:49.463
- Can I say this to you?
- Don't mind me.


489
00:37:51.669 --> 00:37:53.504
I wish I could
love you and my work

490
00:37:53.504 --> 00:37:56.174
and that I could settle down with Joe
at the forge,


491
00:37:56.174 --> 00:37:58.009
and that we could be
sitting here together,


492
00:37:58.009 --> 00:38:00.353
two completely different people.

493
00:38:00.929 --> 00:38:03.978
I do wish I could be content, but...

494
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.227
You cannot.

495
00:38:14.192 --> 00:38:16.365
Might you be content with me?

496
00:38:17.528 --> 00:38:18.780
I might.

497
00:38:20.073 --> 00:38:22.201
But then I'm easily pleased.

498
00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.884
Do you think of her very often?

499
00:38:45.058 --> 00:38:46.435
Pip. Pip!

500
00:38:47.394 --> 00:38:49.192
Gentleman to see you.

501
00:38:51.356 --> 00:38:52.403
You are Philip Pirrip,

502
00:38:53.608 --> 00:38:56.327
<i>more commonly known as Pip,
am I right?</i>


503
00:38:56.987 --> 00:38:59.615
- Yes, sir.
- And this is your brother-in-law...


504
00:39:00.198 --> 00:39:02.747
- Joseph, or "Joe" Gargery?
- I am that man.


505
00:39:02.867 --> 00:39:04.915
- And your wife, Mr Gargery?
- Dead, sir.


506
00:39:04.995 --> 00:39:06.292
Bad heart.

507
00:39:06.372 --> 00:39:10.172
Passed away 5 years since,
while on the rampage. I miss her.


508
00:39:10.918 --> 00:39:12.296
- I miss her.
- Condolences, yes.


509
00:39:13.088 --> 00:39:15.432
My name is Daggers.
I'm a lawyer in London.


510
00:39:15.507 --> 00:39:16.929
I'm pretty well known.

511
00:39:17.342 --> 00:39:20.471
And I have some unusual business
to transact with you.


512
00:39:24.391 --> 00:39:26.769
Joseph Gargery,
I am the bearer of an offer...


513
00:39:26.977 --> 00:39:29.526
To relieve you of this young fellow,
your apprentice.


514
00:39:30.397 --> 00:39:34.573
I am here to inform you
that he has great expectations.


515
00:39:36.778 --> 00:39:39.247
He has come into a handsome fortune,

516
00:39:39.948 --> 00:39:43.703
and it is the desire of the present
possessor of the fortune


517
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:47.164
that he be removed
from his present circumstances


518
00:39:47.247 --> 00:39:49.967
<i>and brought up as
a gentleman in London.</i>


519
00:39:53.796 --> 00:39:55.389
Do you have any objections?

520
00:39:56.799 --> 00:39:59.974
- I don't think so.
- There are conditions, of course.


521
00:40:00.054 --> 00:40:02.648
The first being that you always
retain the name Pip.


522
00:40:02.723 --> 00:40:04.350
You've no objections to that,
I dare say.


523
00:40:04.433 --> 00:40:06.231
I have no objection.

524
00:40:06.685 --> 00:40:08.528
And the second stipulation,

525
00:40:08.604 --> 00:40:13.326
is that the name of the liberal benefactor
remain a profound secret.


526
00:40:14.151 --> 00:40:16.153
You are positively prohibited

527
00:40:16.904 --> 00:40:19.282
from making any enquiries into this question.
Do you understand?


528
00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.583
I understand.

529
00:40:21.992 --> 00:40:23.665
- Mr Gargery?
- Hm?


530
00:40:24.495 --> 00:40:26.623
Mr Gargery, this is for you.

531
00:40:27.206 --> 00:40:28.207
20 guineas.

532
00:40:29.124 --> 00:40:31.253
As compensation
for the loss of his services.


533
00:40:36.341 --> 00:40:38.309
Very generous, 
I think you'd agree.

534
00:40:38.593 --> 00:40:41.187
If you think money can
make compensation


535
00:40:41.262 --> 00:40:43.685
for the loss of the little orphan
what come to the forge and was...


536
00:40:43.848 --> 00:40:46.227
- it's time for us, Joe.
- Yes, yes, yes, very noble sentiment.


537
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:48.062
Very touching, I'm sure.
Do you want the money or no?


538
00:40:48.062 --> 00:40:49.439
- If you're a man, come on!
- Joe.


539
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:52.108
Bear-baiting and badgering me
in my own home.


540
00:40:52.233 --> 00:40:53.684
- Come on, I say!
- Joe!


541
00:40:53.692 --> 00:40:55.365
- Come on, I say!
- Joe! Enough! Enough!


542
00:40:55.528 --> 00:40:57.530
Joe!

543
00:41:08.165 --> 00:41:10.251
Well, Mr Pip, the sooner
you leave here, the better.


544
00:41:10.251 --> 00:41:12.129
Shall we say one week?

545
00:41:14.381 --> 00:41:15.507
And what will I do in London?

546
00:41:15.715 --> 00:41:16.716
Do?

547
00:41:16.967 --> 00:41:18.890
What will be my trade?

548
00:41:19.678 --> 00:41:21.055
My profession?

549
00:41:21.471 --> 00:41:23.269
A gentleman.
You will be a gentleman.


550
00:41:24.224 --> 00:41:25.897
You will please consider me
your guardian now.


551
00:41:29.521 --> 00:41:30.989
Good evening.

552
00:41:35.194 --> 00:41:38.447
Thing is, I always say,
you need your inexpressibles


553
00:41:38.447 --> 00:41:40.415
in something fine, clingy!

554
00:41:41.284 --> 00:41:43.332
A nice lute string, ladies.

555
00:41:43.411 --> 00:41:46.585
No point your inexpressibles
being in nankeen, now, is there?


556
00:41:46.956 --> 00:41:48.208
No point at all.

557
00:41:48.374 --> 00:41:50.468
Nothing clings.
Nothing is expressed.


558
00:41:50.668 --> 00:41:52.888
Mr Pumblechook.

559
00:41:54.089 --> 00:41:56.842
Oh, 7 times 16,
your answer, please.


560
00:41:57.301 --> 00:41:59.520
- Mr Pumblechook.
- Too slow, too slow.


561
00:42:00.304 --> 00:42:01.851
- Mr Pumblechook, I have some news.
- Oh?


562
00:42:02.181 --> 00:42:03.398
I've...

563
00:42:04.099 --> 00:42:05.942
Well, I've come into some property.

564
00:42:10.772 --> 00:42:11.819
Oh.

565
00:42:12.232 --> 00:42:15.577
This is a very sweet article
for light summer wear.


566
00:42:15.777 --> 00:42:17.279
- May I?
- You may.


567
00:42:17.863 --> 00:42:20.037
Ah... Feel the knap?
D'you feel that?


568
00:42:20.283 --> 00:42:21.455
Yah.

569
00:42:21.868 --> 00:42:23.336
See how it catches the light?

570
00:42:23.786 --> 00:42:27.962
Extra super fine and quite in vogue
amongst the London gentry. Number 5...


571
00:42:29.918 --> 00:42:31.170
This is you as well.

572
00:42:31.669 --> 00:42:33.137
This is very you.

573
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:35.759
That will be evening
and that will be daytime.


574
00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:38.018
So, best to get them both.

575
00:42:38.594 --> 00:42:40.267
What about some gentleman's boots?

576
00:42:40.846 --> 00:42:41.972
We don't do boots.

577
00:42:45.643 --> 00:42:47.020
Astonishing.

578
00:42:50.481 --> 00:42:52.154
Oi!

579
00:42:53.108 --> 00:42:54.234
For luck!

580
00:42:58.948 --> 00:43:00.120
- Bye, boy.
- Bye, Pip.


581
00:43:22.265 --> 00:43:24.393
So we thought you might like
a little erm...


582
00:43:25.393 --> 00:43:27.395
A little something
to tempt your appetite.


583
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:29.814
A cup of tea?
You might enjoy the chocolate...


584
00:43:31.691 --> 00:43:32.738
Pip.

585
00:43:33.901 --> 00:43:35.744
Come closer, come closer.

586
00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.288
Come join us.

587
00:43:37.697 --> 00:43:40.246
How handsome you
look in your finery.


588
00:43:40.533 --> 00:43:42.331
You remember my cousin
Sarah Pocket.


589
00:43:43.202 --> 00:43:44.624
She works for me now.

590
00:43:45.204 --> 00:43:46.706
I employ her.

591
00:43:46.789 --> 00:43:47.881
Miss Havisham, I...

592
00:43:48.708 --> 00:43:50.255
I came to take my leave of you.

593
00:43:50.376 --> 00:43:51.878
- You see, I've...
- Yes, yes.


594
00:43:52.461 --> 00:43:55.261
I've seen Mr Jaggers.
I know all about it.


595
00:43:56.633 --> 00:43:59.513
You are adopted
by a mysterious benefactor?


596
00:44:01.806 --> 00:44:02.807
Yes, Miss Havisham.

597
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:05.226
Isn't that wonderful news, everyone?

598
00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:07.353
- Yes, quite...
- Wonderful.


599
00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:09.321
- Wonderful.
- Go now. Everyone, go.


600
00:44:09.897 --> 00:44:11.444
All of you, go.

601
00:44:12.108 --> 00:44:13.234
Hmph.

602
00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:19.119
I was, uh, hoping that...

603
00:44:19.532 --> 00:44:20.658
She's abroad, Pip.

604
00:44:20.992 --> 00:44:22.790
Educating for a lady.

605
00:44:23.369 --> 00:44:25.542
Far out of reach.
Prettier than ever.


606
00:44:26.539 --> 00:44:28.633
Admired by all who see her.

607
00:44:29.584 --> 00:44:31.552
Do you feel you have lost her, Pip?

608
00:44:32.378 --> 00:44:33.755
Be patient.

609
00:44:33.838 --> 00:44:35.806
I'm sure your paths will cross.

610
00:44:36.924 --> 00:44:38.973
- I hope so.
- Mm.


611
00:44:40.597 --> 00:44:42.065
Miss Havisham,
I wished to say how grateful...


612
00:44:42.557 --> 00:44:45.276
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
Hush now, Pip.


613
00:44:46.978 --> 00:44:48.480
You will always keep the name of Pip,
you know.


614
00:44:54.819 --> 00:44:55.866
Go.

615
00:44:59.741 --> 00:45:01.209
Goodbye, Pip.

616
00:45:06.039 --> 00:45:08.167
Hey! Hey!

617
00:45:46.873 --> 00:45:48.216
Here, sir, you want some offal?

618
00:45:54.214 --> 00:45:55.466
Get off!

619
00:46:04.308 --> 00:46:05.855
Excuse me, sir.

620
00:46:30.878 --> 00:46:32.380
Meat!

621
00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:34.552
Lovely meat!

622
00:46:37.259 --> 00:46:38.476
Mr Pip?

623
00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.313
Mr Jaggers will be with
you shortly, Mr Pip.


624
00:46:41.388 --> 00:46:43.562
He's at the Bailey,
getting evidence together.


625
00:46:47.812 --> 00:46:49.606
Whose likenesses are they?

626
00:46:49.606 --> 00:46:50.653
Likenesses?

627
00:46:51.149 --> 00:46:54.244
Why, this is their true selves!

628
00:46:54.402 --> 00:46:56.780
<i>Casts made in Newgate,
fresh from the gallows.</i>


629
00:46:58.781 --> 00:47:01.456
Murderer, and a forger of wills.

630
00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:03.537
Very crafty in particular, this one.

631
00:47:04.205 --> 00:47:06.173
But the evidence was too strong.

632
00:47:06.248 --> 00:47:08.091
Not so crafty now,
are you, my friend?


633
00:47:08.792 --> 00:47:11.420
This was his as well. Made a gift
of it to me, just before the end.


634
00:47:12.379 --> 00:47:14.256
They're not worth much,
but they're portable,


635
00:47:14.924 --> 00:47:16.096
and they're property.

636
00:47:16.175 --> 00:47:17.968
That's my guiding star, Mr Pip.

637
00:47:17.968 --> 00:47:21.518
- Get hold of portable properly.
- I have no more to say to you.


638
00:47:21.597 --> 00:47:22.598
That's Mr Jaggers now.

639
00:47:24.851 --> 00:47:26.524
I wish to know no more than I know.
Good day, Mr Pip.


640
00:47:26.811 --> 00:47:28.779
- Any more news, Mr Jaggers?
- Get your hands off me!


641
00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.982
- Have you paid MrWemmick?
- Yes.


642
00:47:31.066 --> 00:47:32.192
Now let go of my coat.

643
00:47:32.275 --> 00:47:33.822
I trust your journey was satisfactory.

644
00:47:34.152 --> 00:47:36.496
Mr daggers, have you had any
feelings about my claim?


645
00:47:36.821 --> 00:47:38.869
Feelings? Feelings?

646
00:47:39.282 --> 00:47:40.909
We'll have no "feelings" here.

647
00:47:41.243 --> 00:47:42.586
Come on in, Mr Pip.

648
00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.542
Move back!

649
00:47:46.248 --> 00:47:47.795
You've met Mr Wemmick.

650
00:47:48.709 --> 00:47:49.710
Sorry, sir.

651
00:47:49.794 --> 00:47:53.014
He keeps the money, so doubtless
you will be seeing a lot of him.


652
00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:56.183
Dear Lord, is that your new suit?

653
00:47:56.551 --> 00:47:57.643
Here.

654
00:47:58.135 --> 00:48:02.481
Tailor, hatter, bootmaker, hosier.

655
00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:04.892
Your credit will be good
with all of them.


656
00:48:04.976 --> 00:48:08.151
I've taken the liberty of enrolling you
in a gentlemen's club.


657
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:12.110
The Finches of the Grove.
Just the thing for gentlemen of distinction.


658
00:48:13.068 --> 00:48:14.160
Your allowance, Mr Pip.

659
00:48:14.528 --> 00:48:17.202
I trust you will find it generous.

660
00:48:17.281 --> 00:48:21.707
Your temporary lodgings
will be at Barnard's Inn.


661
00:48:22.202 --> 00:48:23.704
Quite near here,
so I might keep an eye on you.


662
00:48:23.787 --> 00:48:24.788
There you are, sir.

663
00:48:24.997 --> 00:48:29.173
And pull you up
when I find you going wrong.


664
00:48:29.793 --> 00:48:32.216
And, you will go wrong, Mr Pip,

665
00:48:33.505 --> 00:48:36.851
not through any fault of mine.

666
00:49:14.548 --> 00:49:16.391
- Mr Pip?
- Mr Pocket?


667
00:49:16.634 --> 00:49:20.013
I am extremely sorry,
but I thought that,


668
00:49:20.387 --> 00:49:22.641
coming from the country,
you might like a little fruit.


669
00:49:23.224 --> 00:49:24.271
- Strawberries!
- Oh.


670
00:49:25.185 --> 00:49:26.562
Oh. Strawberry jam!

671
00:49:28.104 --> 00:49:29.982
Mm. Have you seen your lodgings?

672
00:49:30.399 --> 00:49:32.610
- No.
- They're by no means splendid,


673
00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:35.489
but I'm sure that we
shan't come to blows.


674
00:49:42.828 --> 00:49:44.080
Put them up.

675
00:49:45.164 --> 00:49:46.416
Come on.

676
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:48.751
Come on.

677
00:49:49.919 --> 00:49:50.966
Come on.

678
00:49:52.129 --> 00:49:54.928
Stand your ground.
Regular rules apply.


679
00:49:55.007 --> 00:49:56.099
I beg your pardon?

680
00:50:01.681 --> 00:50:04.275
The prowling boy.

681
00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:08.771
The pale young gentleman.

682
00:50:11.859 --> 00:50:15.534
I was there with my Aunt Sarah
on a trial visit.


683
00:50:15.613 --> 00:50:18.958
Miss Havisham fancied
that she wanted to see me play.


684
00:50:28.042 --> 00:50:30.136
Clearly she didn't take
much of a fancy to me.


685
00:50:30.503 --> 00:50:33.052
Poor taste on her part.
But just as well.


686
00:50:33.131 --> 00:50:35.975
Otherwise, I might have been
what-you-called it to Estella.


687
00:50:36.968 --> 00:50:38.720
Affianced. Betrothed.

688
00:50:39.429 --> 00:50:40.646
Engaged.

689
00:50:41.806 --> 00:50:44.650
But, it was not to be.

690
00:50:45.435 --> 00:50:46.687
I'm very sorry.

691
00:50:47.311 --> 00:50:48.483
Sorry?

692
00:50:48.771 --> 00:50:50.648
The girl's a Tartar.

693
00:50:51.315 --> 00:50:53.239
Hard and haughty and...
Thank you.


694
00:50:53.902 --> 00:50:55.654
...Capricious to the last degree.

695
00:50:55.654 --> 00:51:00.001
Brought up by Miss Havisham
to wreak revenge on all the male sex.


696
00:51:03.329 --> 00:51:04.626
Why should she wreak revenge?

697
00:51:06.708 --> 00:51:08.927
Lord, Mr Pip. Don't you know?

698
00:51:11.045 --> 00:51:13.889
Miss Havisham was very
rich and very proud,


699
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:15.675
a spoilt child.

700
00:51:15.675 --> 00:51:19.179
Her mother died when she was young
and her father married again.


701
00:51:19.262 --> 00:51:21.435
His cook would you believe?

702
00:51:21.931 --> 00:51:24.184
And they had a son, Arthur.

703
00:51:24.184 --> 00:51:28.234
<i>Who was... How might I put this?
...Not entirely legitimate.</i>


704
00:51:29.898 --> 00:51:31.946
At this point,
I might break off and mention


705
00:51:32.025 --> 00:51:34.449
that in London it's not the custom
to put the knife in the mouth,


706
00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:37.072
- for fear of accidents.
- Sorry.


707
00:51:39.283 --> 00:51:42.036
And also the fork is not generally used
underhand but over.


708
00:51:42.578 --> 00:51:44.547
- Of course. Of course.
- Do you mind?


709
00:51:44.623 --> 00:51:47.092
No, not at all. I'm grateful.

710
00:51:47.501 --> 00:51:50.254
Er... T's, Mr Pip.

711
00:51:50.879 --> 00:51:52.131
You are grateful.

712
00:51:53.048 --> 00:51:54.800
Grateful. Sorry.

713
00:51:55.342 --> 00:51:56.685
Now, um...

714
00:51:57.719 --> 00:52:00.063
Miss Havisham met a certain man

715
00:52:00.138 --> 00:52:03.062
and she loved this man,
devotedly, passionately.


716
00:52:03.558 --> 00:52:04.559
Idolised him.

717
00:52:05.685 --> 00:52:07.779
And soon they were engaged.

718
00:52:09.064 --> 00:52:11.399
He persuaded her to buy
her half-brother's share of the brewery


719
00:52:11.399 --> 00:52:13.743
at an immense price,
so that when he was her husband,


720
00:52:13.819 --> 00:52:16.164
he could hold and manage it all.

721
00:52:17.824 --> 00:52:18.825
Well...

722
00:52:20.409 --> 00:52:22.252
<i>The happy day arrived.</i>

723
00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:25.915
<i>The wedding dresses were bought,
the wedding tour planned out.</i>


724
00:52:25.915 --> 00:52:29.419
<i>The wedding guests were invited,
my parents among them.</i>


725
00:52:30.504 --> 00:52:31.505
The feast was laid out.

726
00:52:31.755 --> 00:52:33.757
<i>A great bride cake made.</i>

727
00:52:35.425 --> 00:52:37.848
<i>And the groom wrote
her a letter.</i>


728
00:52:39.054 --> 00:52:42.103
<i>And she received the letter
from her brother, Arthur...</i>


729
00:52:42.933 --> 00:52:44.268
- As she was dressing for marriage?
- At 20...


730
00:52:44.268 --> 00:52:45.611
20 minutes to 9.

731
00:52:45.978 --> 00:52:48.231
<i>Of course.
Ah those stopped clocks.</i>


732
00:52:48.438 --> 00:52:52.284
<i>It was a conspiracy between
the groom and her brother,</i>


733
00:52:52.776 --> 00:52:55.199
<i>to defraud Miss Havisham
and break her heart.</i>


734
00:52:59.284 --> 00:53:00.285
No!

735
00:53:18.762 --> 00:53:21.481
And, in that they most
surely succeeded.


736
00:53:23.642 --> 00:53:26.312
So, Herbert, what's
your line of business?


737
00:53:26.312 --> 00:53:28.155
Well, trade.

738
00:53:28.647 --> 00:53:30.069
That's where the money is.

739
00:53:30.149 --> 00:53:34.700
In the future, I shall trade to Egypt
for silks and spices.


740
00:53:34.987 --> 00:53:37.035
Ceylon for elephant tusks.

741
00:53:37.948 --> 00:53:39.041
But for now?

742
00:53:40.535 --> 00:53:43.830
But for now,
I am a clerk in a counting house,


743
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:46.754
with a sweetheart
whom I can't afford to marry.


744
00:53:46.833 --> 00:53:49.552
- Is there profit in being a clerk?
- No.


745
00:53:49.753 --> 00:53:51.346
None whatsoever.

746
00:53:51.421 --> 00:53:52.843
Not a penny.

747
00:53:55.675 --> 00:53:58.144
You know, I don't much care for
the name Mr Pip.


748
00:53:59.346 --> 00:54:02.682
I'll tell you what I should like.
Seeing as we are so harmonious


749
00:54:02.682 --> 00:54:04.401
and you have been a blacksmith,

750
00:54:04.477 --> 00:54:07.321
would you mind Handel
for a familiar name?


751
00:54:08.814 --> 00:54:10.612
The Harmonious Blacksmith.
It's by Handel.


752
00:54:18.366 --> 00:54:20.702
- Do you mind?
- I would like it very much.


753
00:54:20.702 --> 00:54:21.828
Good!

754
00:54:25.874 --> 00:54:27.592
As Bullfinch of this Grove,

755
00:54:27.668 --> 00:54:29.545
and in the name
of the most honoured Chaffinch...


756
00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.547
- Fringillae!
- ...Goldfinch...


757
00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:32.631
Carduelis!

758
00:54:32.714 --> 00:54:33.882
...and Hawfinch.

759
00:54:33.882 --> 00:54:35.258
Coccothraustes!

760
00:54:35.258 --> 00:54:37.181
May the present promotion
of good feeling


761
00:54:37.469 --> 00:54:40.894
ever reign predominant
among the noble Finches of the Grove.


762
00:54:41.181 --> 00:54:42.182
Gentlemen...

763
00:54:44.851 --> 00:54:46.353
Huzzah! Huzzah!

764
00:54:46.812 --> 00:54:48.189
For the Finches of the Grove!

765
00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:03.255
I am assured that they are
the most fashionable people.


766
00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:05.086
Believe me. Oh.

767
00:55:05.791 --> 00:55:07.919
You there! New boy. 
Yes, you there.

768
00:55:08.961 --> 00:55:10.383
Partridge.

769
00:55:11.463 --> 00:55:13.306
Throw me a partridge.

770
00:55:15.884 --> 00:55:16.885
Come on, come on.

771
00:55:22.474 --> 00:55:24.522
Oh, dear. I don't think
he shall do well here.


772
00:55:26.895 --> 00:55:28.112
Pip, isn't it?

773
00:55:28.647 --> 00:55:31.070
- Er, Pip?
- Pirrip.


774
00:55:33.027 --> 00:55:34.244
Pirrip?

775
00:55:35.863 --> 00:55:36.864
Pip Pirrip?

776
00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:40.452
Oh. How remarkable.

777
00:55:41.453 --> 00:55:42.876
And where are your people from?

778
00:55:44.832 --> 00:55:46.675
- My people?
- From Kent.


779
00:55:47.209 --> 00:55:48.677
They're the Kentish Pirrips.

780
00:55:48.961 --> 00:55:50.508
You sound like some sort of apple.

781
00:56:08.898 --> 00:56:10.149
Huzzah!

782
00:56:10.149 --> 00:56:11.492
Noble finches of this grove!

783
00:56:21.952 --> 00:56:23.829
This will just take a moment, my dear.

784
00:56:23.913 --> 00:56:25.708
- He seems very keen.
- I'm sure.


785
00:56:25.708 --> 00:56:28.552
Handel, this is my beloved fiancee, Clara.

786
00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:31.548
- Aren't I the lucky one?
- Herbert, please.


787
00:56:31.631 --> 00:56:34.680
So pleased to meet you. Shall we?

788
00:56:39.347 --> 00:56:41.516
This is far too expensive
for you, Herbert.


789
00:56:41.516 --> 00:56:43.439
What are we doing here?

790
00:56:44.977 --> 00:56:46.945
There you are, sir.

791
00:56:47.688 --> 00:56:49.986
Well? What do you think?

792
00:56:52.527 --> 00:56:54.370
It would be at my expense, of course.

793
00:56:54.445 --> 00:56:56.743
You're a clerk, 
Herbert Pocket.

794
00:56:59.867 --> 00:57:00.993
Well?

795
00:57:03.454 --> 00:57:04.671
Well...

796
00:57:08.502 --> 00:57:09.674
Hurry!

797
00:57:09.878 --> 00:57:13.258
I'd like to meet these extravagant
Finches of yours.


798
00:57:13.258 --> 00:57:14.635
Tomorrow evening.

799
00:57:14.717 --> 00:57:16.890
No ceremony. No dinner dress.

800
00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:18.893
6 o'clock, say?

801
00:57:19.013 --> 00:57:21.141
Give him the money, Wemmick.

802
00:57:21.224 --> 00:57:22.225
Very well, sir.

803
00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:26.984
What shall I make of him,
Mr Wemmick?


804
00:57:29.065 --> 00:57:32.239
He's a deep one. Deep.

805
00:57:33.903 --> 00:57:35.405
As Australia.

806
00:57:35.572 --> 00:57:37.574
Don't take it personal, Mr Pip.
It's professional.


807
00:57:38.241 --> 00:57:39.914
Only professional.

808
00:57:40.076 --> 00:57:42.829
I say, if tonight you have
nothing better to do,


809
00:57:43.079 --> 00:57:44.831
why don't you come home
to Walworth with me?


810
00:57:44.914 --> 00:57:47.509
<i>I don't have much to show you
but there's a garden</i>


811
00:57:47.585 --> 00:57:49.303
<i>and one or two curiosities.</i>

812
00:57:49.712 --> 00:57:51.430
- What?
- Watch this.


813
00:57:52.047 --> 00:57:53.264
I know what you're thinking.

814
00:57:54.091 --> 00:57:56.435
It's like living in the country.

815
00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:00.223
All my own doing.

816
00:58:01.641 --> 00:58:04.110
Please, now...

817
00:58:04.519 --> 00:58:07.773
Let me introduce you
to the aged parent.


818
00:58:11.443 --> 00:58:14.788
- Well, Aged P, how are you?
- All right, John, my boy. All right.


819
00:58:15.655 --> 00:58:17.616
This is Mr Pip, Aged P.

820
00:58:17.616 --> 00:58:19.664
Not that he can hear
a word I'm saying.


821
00:58:19.743 --> 00:58:21.916
Just nod away at him,
if you don't mind. Nod and wink.


822
00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.292
- Now, John...
- Nod.


823
00:58:23.371 --> 00:58:25.624
- Now...
- And wink. Keep nodding. One more.


824
00:58:25.957 --> 00:58:28.881
Nearly time, Aged P. You keep
nodding, I'll heat the poker.


825
00:58:29.295 --> 00:58:31.218
Down the stairs, that's right.

826
00:58:37.303 --> 00:58:38.771
Now, John. Now.

827
00:58:39.055 --> 00:58:42.059
Mr Pip. Mr Pip, if you'd care
to do the honours.


828
00:58:46.855 --> 00:58:47.981
Ooh!

829
00:58:50.192 --> 00:58:52.115
I heard it! I heard it!

830
00:58:53.362 --> 00:58:56.491
- Does Mr Jaggers admire it?
- Never seen it. Never heard of it.


831
00:58:56.573 --> 00:58:58.825
Never seen the Aged.
Never heard of him.


832
00:58:58.825 --> 00:59:02.375
When I come into The Castle,
I leave Mr Jaggers behind.


833
00:59:02.454 --> 00:59:04.582
And if it's not in any way
disagreeable to you,


834
00:59:04.665 --> 00:59:06.633
you'll oblige me by doing the same.

835
00:59:06.875 --> 00:59:08.092
Of course. I understand.

836
00:59:08.168 --> 00:59:10.672
I will give you one piece of advice,
though.


837
00:59:11.506 --> 00:59:14.225
When you dine with
Mr Jaggers tomorrow,


838
00:59:14.467 --> 00:59:16.344
you take a look at his
housekeeper, Molly.


839
00:59:16.886 --> 00:59:18.221
<i>His housekeeper? Why?</i>

840
00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:20.849
<i>Just take a look at his
housekeeper and see,</i>


841
00:59:20.932 --> 00:59:22.525
<i>a wild beast tamed.</i>

842
00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:24.852
Now, gentlemen! Gentlemen!

843
00:59:24.936 --> 00:59:28.236
Our generous host,
Mr Bentley Drummle.


844
00:59:30.858 --> 00:59:32.030
Oh...

845
00:59:32.735 --> 00:59:35.364
May the present promotion
of good feeling


846
00:59:35.364 --> 00:59:38.959
ever reign predominant over the
Noble Finches of the Grove.


847
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.254
See, Bentley, Hold you,
you could do it.


848
00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:49.383
Tell me, Pip. Who is the Spider?

849
00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:52.720
That blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow?

850
00:59:53.216 --> 00:59:55.969
That's Bentley Drummle.
The richest young man in England.


851
00:59:57.137 --> 00:59:58.810
- Is it now?
- He owns most of Derbyshire, apparently.


852
01:00:00.265 --> 01:00:01.517
Bentley Drummle, you say?

853
01:00:02.475 --> 01:00:03.647
Most promising.

854
01:00:04.561 --> 01:00:05.733
Molly.

855
01:00:06.104 --> 01:00:08.857
Make sure that fellow does not have
an empty glass all evening.


856
01:00:16.031 --> 01:00:18.250
Come on!

857
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:22.629
My money's on Bentley!
I raise you five!


858
01:00:23.122 --> 01:00:24.339
Oh!

859
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.752
A fluke. Pure chance.

860
01:00:28.002 --> 01:00:31.347
Come, come, Bentley, concede defeat.
Pip beat you fair and square.


861
01:00:31.756 --> 01:00:35.261
I was under the impression that
the Finches was a club for gentlemen.


862
01:00:36.261 --> 01:00:38.263
I can't be expected to compete
against country boys.


863
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:40.891
What do you mean, Mr Drummle?

864
01:00:41.933 --> 01:00:43.526
No slight, I assure you.

865
01:00:45.103 --> 01:00:47.606
In fact, I salute you, 
Kentish Pirrip!

866
01:00:49.191 --> 01:00:50.408
You have the arms of a blacksmith!

867
01:00:53.028 --> 01:00:54.905
Molly, more wine here.

868
01:00:57.366 --> 01:00:58.538
You talk of strength.

869
01:00:59.534 --> 01:01:01.081
I'll show you strength.

870
01:01:01.328 --> 01:01:03.296
Show them your wrists, Molly.
Come on.


871
01:01:03.413 --> 01:01:05.381
- Master, don't!
- Show them both.


872
01:01:05.457 --> 01:01:06.504
Show them. Show them.

873
01:01:11.672 --> 01:01:13.140
What is that?

874
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:14.721
Mm.

875
01:01:15.677 --> 01:01:17.179
There's power.

876
01:01:18.806 --> 01:01:21.650
Very few men have the power
this woman has.


877
01:01:26.313 --> 01:01:28.941
Gentlemen, I propose a toast.

878
01:01:30.317 --> 01:01:32.411
I drink to you, Mr Drummle.

879
01:01:33.028 --> 01:01:34.496
To your good health, Bentley!

880
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:40.957
I apologise if anything disagreeable...

881
01:01:42.287 --> 01:01:44.210
Oh, no, no. That's all right.

882
01:01:45.416 --> 01:01:48.386
- I do like that Spider fellow, though.
- Do you? I don't.


883
01:01:49.503 --> 01:01:51.346
No. No, you're right, of course.

884
01:01:51.755 --> 01:01:53.348
Stay as clear of him as you can.

885
01:01:55.844 --> 01:01:58.348
He does have great promise, though.

886
01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:02.019
Indeed, if I were a fortune teller.

887
01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:06.071
But I'm not a fortune teller.

888
01:02:07.523 --> 01:02:09.742
You know what I am, don't you?

889
01:02:12.194 --> 01:02:14.288
Go to bed, Pip.
Good night.


890
01:02:24.999 --> 01:02:26.750
Sir.

891
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:28.548
<i>Come on! Come on, sir!</i>

892
01:02:29.086 --> 01:02:30.884
Get up!

893
01:02:32.214 --> 01:02:34.012
Someone to see you, sir.

894
01:02:35.676 --> 01:02:38.305
Pepper, I've told you
I'm not to be woken unless the...


895
01:02:39.973 --> 01:02:41.396
How are you, Pip?

896
01:03:00.036 --> 01:03:02.246
I brought you a toasting fork
as a present,


897
01:03:02.246 --> 01:03:04.795
you know, for crumpets and the like.

898
01:03:04.916 --> 01:03:06.259
But I see you have no need.

899
01:03:06.626 --> 01:03:08.469
That's... It's perfect,
Joe. Thank you.


900
01:03:09.545 --> 01:03:12.424
- Tea or coffee, sir?
- Oh! Tea, sir, please, if you don't mind.


901
01:03:12.507 --> 01:03:14.930
I find the coffee
a little powerful.


902
01:03:18.804 --> 01:03:21.149
- Us two now being alone, sir...
- Sir?


903
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:23.686
Joe, how can you call me sir?

904
01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:26.898
Us two being now alone, Pip,

905
01:03:27.022 --> 01:03:30.448
I might tell you the reason for me being
in the abode of a gentleman,


906
01:03:30.527 --> 01:03:35.078
which is that I've had a communication
with a certain Miss A.


907
01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:39.786
Miss A? Joe?

908
01:03:41.871 --> 01:03:44.966
Miss 'Avisham. She wishes to see you
on a matter of great import.


909
01:03:48.836 --> 01:03:50.759
Joe, this is my good friend
Herbert Pocket.


910
01:03:51.923 --> 01:03:54.676
- Mr Gargery, I've heard a great deal about you.
- Nice to meet you.


911
01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:56.803
Oh? What is there to say?

912
01:03:56.803 --> 01:03:57.850
A very great deal.

913
01:03:57.929 --> 01:04:00.432
Now, suppose we have a celebration?

914
01:04:11.151 --> 01:04:13.700
It takes some getting used to, eh, Joe?

915
01:04:14.738 --> 01:04:17.492
Now, this place may look a little rough
but don't be deceived.


916
01:04:17.576 --> 01:04:20.796
<i>In my opinion, this is the finest
place in London.</i>


917
01:04:21.997 --> 01:04:24.500
Oh, and the pressed duck is superb.

918
01:04:29.879 --> 01:04:31.176
Let him take it, Joe.

919
01:04:40.557 --> 01:04:41.649
Joe.

920
01:04:49.525 --> 01:04:51.118
How do you find
London, Mr Gargery?


921
01:04:51.193 --> 01:04:53.537
London! What a place!
What a place!


922
01:04:54.071 --> 01:04:56.915
Course, I wouldn't
keep a pig in it myself.


923
01:05:09.463 --> 01:05:13.184
Biddy sends her regards.
She's a teacher now, a good one.


924
01:05:13.634 --> 01:05:14.931
She taught me.

925
01:05:15.385 --> 01:05:16.602
Fork. F
-O
-R
-K.

926
01:05:16.928 --> 01:05:19.101
Knife. N-I-F-E.
I know it's not!


927
01:05:19.222 --> 01:05:20.724
- More wine, Mr Gargery?
- Yes, please.


928
01:05:22.851 --> 01:05:24.229
Joe, please.

929
01:05:24.729 --> 01:05:27.482
There's really no need to be so
conscientious in emptying your glass.


930
01:05:29.984 --> 01:05:32.112
The rim should never
touch your nose, Joe.


931
01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:39.369
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me.

932
01:05:50.130 --> 01:05:51.803
Well, business concluded,

933
01:05:52.424 --> 01:05:53.596
I'll be off.

934
01:05:53.676 --> 01:05:55.428
- You're going now?
- Yes, I am.


935
01:05:55.761 --> 01:05:58.264
- Please, put your money away, Joe.
- No. No, I insist.


936
01:05:59.181 --> 01:06:01.104
- You will not stay the night?
- No, I won't.


937
01:06:01.433 --> 01:06:03.151
Sir! Sir!

938
01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.405
For God's sake, Joe,
put your money away!


939
01:06:28.586 --> 01:06:29.803
Joe!

940
01:06:30.839 --> 01:06:33.137
<i>- At least, let me walk you to the coach.
- I'll find my way.</i>


941
01:06:34.092 --> 01:06:37.347
But we have barely spoken, Joe.
I wished to show you some sights.


942
01:06:37.805 --> 01:06:40.308
You and me are not two figures
to be together in London.


943
01:06:40.808 --> 01:06:44.654
I'm wrong outside the forge,
and the kitchen and the marshes.


944
01:06:45.479 --> 01:06:47.824
You come sometime and you put your
head in at the window at the forge


945
01:06:47.899 --> 01:06:51.324
and you'll see Joe the blacksmith,
and what larks we'll have!


946
01:06:52.237 --> 01:06:55.036
But here, Pip,
here I am most awful dull.


947
01:06:56.158 --> 01:06:58.957
So God bless you, dear old Pip, old chap.
God bless you!


948
01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:16.477
You know the way.

949
01:07:21.933 --> 01:07:23.356
Pip.

950
01:07:24.187 --> 01:07:25.689
How do you do?

951
01:07:28.776 --> 01:07:31.370
You kiss my hand as
if I was a queen.

952
01:07:32.571 --> 01:07:34.619
- You wished to see me?
- Mm.


953
01:07:55.469 --> 01:07:56.561
Pip.

954
01:08:06.396 --> 01:08:08.899
<i>I am to be sent to London.</i>

955
01:08:08.899 --> 01:08:11.745
I am to go on show,
myself and the jewels.


956
01:08:17.618 --> 01:08:19.120
Do you wish to go on show?

957
01:08:20.746 --> 01:08:21.998
Why ask?

958
01:08:22.373 --> 01:08:25.843
We have no choice, you and I,
but to obey instructions.


959
01:08:29.588 --> 01:08:32.057
I watched you, you know, that day.

960
01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.723
Fighting for my honour.

961
01:08:35.302 --> 01:08:39.432
I must have been a strange little creature
to hide and watch, but I did.


962
01:08:40.266 --> 01:08:41.939
I enjoyed it very much.

963
01:08:42.017 --> 01:08:44.065
You rewarded me very much.

964
01:08:44.895 --> 01:08:46.067
Did I?

965
01:08:49.483 --> 01:08:50.985
You kissed me.

966
01:08:52.028 --> 01:08:53.280
Poor Pip.

967
01:09:00.621 --> 01:09:03.750
You imagine yourself a young knight
from a child's story,


968
01:09:04.292 --> 01:09:08.047
tearing away the cobwebs and thorns,
letting in the sunshine.


969
01:09:08.379 --> 01:09:10.256
Marrying the princess.

970
01:09:14.844 --> 01:09:17.313
But you must know, Pip,
I have no heart.


971
01:09:17.388 --> 01:09:19.640
I don't believe it. How can there
be beauty without a heart?


972
01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:22.109
Oh, I have a heart
to be stabbed in or shot in,


973
01:09:22.977 --> 01:09:26.026
and if it ceased to beat,
I should cease to be.


974
01:09:26.814 --> 01:09:29.158
But there's no softness there.

975
01:09:30.276 --> 01:09:31.653
No sym path?

976
01:09:32.653 --> 01:09:33.997
Sentiment.

977
01:09:36.575 --> 01:09:39.078
Nonsense. I've been made that way.

978
01:09:40.329 --> 01:09:42.423
- Oh, I...
- I am serious, Pip.


979
01:09:43.666 --> 01:09:46.966
If we're to be thrown together,
you must believe me.


980
01:09:47.337 --> 01:09:48.554
For both our sakes.

981
01:09:50.173 --> 01:09:51.971
I'm sorry, I cannot.

982
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:53.927
I will not.

983
01:09:55.094 --> 01:09:57.517
Very well. It is said at any rate.

984
01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:05.780
Come, Miss Havisham will be
expecting you at your old post.


985
01:10:08.524 --> 01:10:09.821
<i>Is she beautiful?</i>

986
01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:12.070
Is she graceful?

987
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:13.743
Is she well-grown?

988
01:10:14.405 --> 01:10:15.407
Do you admire her?

989
01:10:16.450 --> 01:10:18.748
- Of course.
- Then love her. Love her, Pip.


990
01:10:19.203 --> 01:10:21.501
If she wounds you, love her.
If she fails you, love her.


991
01:10:21.747 --> 01:10:24.626
If she tears your heart to pieces,
as it gets older, it will tear deeper,


992
01:10:24.875 --> 01:10:27.253
but love her, love her, love her!

993
01:10:27.461 --> 01:10:29.634
I adopted her to be loved.
I bred her to be loved.


994
01:10:30.715 --> 01:10:33.559
I educated her and I developed her
into what she is.


995
01:10:34.386 --> 01:10:36.514
You know what love is, Pip?

996
01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:37.852
It is blind devotion.

997
01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.563
It is self-humiliation.

998
01:10:40.809 --> 01:10:42.060
It is degradation.

999
01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:46.606
It is utter submission, giving up
your heart and soul as I did to that man.


1000
01:10:46.606 --> 01:10:48.529
Miss Havisham!

1001
01:10:48.942 --> 01:10:50.694
Enough excitement for one day.

1002
01:10:51.111 --> 01:10:55.491
Pip, you've been requested to escort
Estella to London in the morning.


1003
01:10:55.657 --> 01:10:57.251
I suggest an early night.

1004
01:11:03.207 --> 01:11:04.299
Miss Havisham.

1005
01:11:06.502 --> 01:11:08.425
Shall we take a trip?

1006
01:11:09.839 --> 01:11:11.216
Once round?

1007
01:11:37.617 --> 01:11:40.121
<i>Old Clem,
with a thump and a sound<i></i></i>


1008
01:11:41.205 --> 01:11:42.548
<i>Old Clem<i></i></i>

1009
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:44.713
<i>Beat it out, beat it out<i></i></i>

1010
01:11:44.959 --> 01:11:46.632
<i>Old Clem with a...<i></i></i>

1011
01:12:10.027 --> 01:12:14.703
Mrs Brandley is to be paid a large
sum of money to introduce me to society.


1012
01:12:15.699 --> 01:12:17.326
The jewels and I.

1013
01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:20.584
- We are to be shown to people...
- Hurry up!


1014
01:12:20.997 --> 01:12:23.170
...and people are to be shown to us.

1015
01:12:23.666 --> 01:12:26.510
- And may I come and see you?
- Of course.


1016
01:12:26.836 --> 01:12:28.838
Miss Havisham expects it.

1017
01:12:29.339 --> 01:12:31.091
If my time permits.

1018
01:12:35.178 --> 01:12:39.558
I see bills from vintners,
bills from jewellers, from bookmakers.


1019
01:12:39.641 --> 01:12:43.441
I suspected you would go wrong, Pip,
but really you are excelling yourself.


1020
01:12:43.603 --> 01:12:44.896
I'll endeavour to show more restraint.

1021
01:12:44.896 --> 01:12:46.364
Oh, do as you will,
it's no business of mine.


1022
01:12:48.817 --> 01:12:51.570
Will you make sure that Mr Pip gets the money
he requires. Thank you, Wemmick?


1023
01:12:52.863 --> 01:12:54.206
Excuse me.

1024
01:12:55.366 --> 01:12:57.368
Ah. Good day to you, sir.

1025
01:12:57.952 --> 01:13:00.375
Please come into my office.
So good to see you again.


1026
01:13:27.607 --> 01:13:29.905
Finches, Finches,
I would like to raise a glass


1027
01:13:30.443 --> 01:13:31.911
to a lady of my acquaintance.

1028
01:13:32.487 --> 01:13:33.784
Ooh!

1029
01:13:34.948 --> 01:13:36.746
A lady of Richmond.

1030
01:13:38.034 --> 01:13:39.708
A peerless beauty.

1031
01:13:40.955 --> 01:13:43.254
Miss Estella Havisham!

1032
01:13:43.917 --> 01:13:46.090
- Miss Estella Havisham!
- I know that lady.


1033
01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.137
Do you?

1034
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:49.631
Oh, Lord

1035
01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.467
And you know nothing of her!

1036
01:13:51.925 --> 01:13:54.519
Well, on the contrary,
I've had the pleasure of dancing with her.


1037
01:13:55.387 --> 01:13:57.139
- Several times.
- You lie!


1038
01:13:57.556 --> 01:13:58.773
Steady now, Handel.

1039
01:13:59.975 --> 01:14:01.192
Indeed.

1040
01:14:02.644 --> 01:14:04.772
Then perhaps you might care
to follow me.


1041
01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:31.676
Out of my way!

1042
01:14:32.009 --> 01:14:33.386
Out of my way!

1043
01:14:34.637 --> 01:14:35.980
Out of my way!

1044
01:14:42.686 --> 01:14:44.438
Step away from the lady, sir.

1045
01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:54.740
A waltz!

1046
01:15:21.686 --> 01:15:24.189
- The dance is not yet over.
- Remove your hand, sir.


1047
01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:34.328
Oh, hard luck. Come on.

1048
01:15:49.464 --> 01:15:51.637
Pip, will you never take warning?

1049
01:15:51.717 --> 01:15:53.890
- How can you do it, Estella?
- What?


1050
01:15:53.969 --> 01:15:55.762
Give your affections to that man.

1051
01:15:55.762 --> 01:15:58.857
All sorts of ugly creatures
hover about a lighted candle.


1052
01:15:59.308 --> 01:16:01.102
- Can the candle help it?
- No, but you can.


1053
01:16:01.102 --> 01:16:03.104
Perhaps. If I cared.

1054
01:16:03.896 --> 01:16:05.569
But you must care!

1055
01:16:06.774 --> 01:16:09.072
To encourage a man as despised,

1056
01:16:09.152 --> 01:16:12.156
<i>as unworthy and boorish
as Bentley Drummle.</i>


1057
01:16:12.405 --> 01:16:15.158
And this is a man who has nothing
to recommend him except money...


1058
01:16:15.241 --> 01:16:17.585
Pip, don't let it affect you so.

1059
01:16:18.369 --> 01:16:19.962
I can't help it!

1060
01:16:20.079 --> 01:16:22.252
To give that man the looks and smiles
you never give to me...


1061
01:16:22.332 --> 01:16:24.255
Do you want me to deceive you?

1062
01:16:25.918 --> 01:16:27.841
- Do you deceive him?
- Yes!


1063
01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.758
Yes, him and many,
many other men.


1064
01:16:30.758 --> 01:16:32.010
All men.

1065
01:16:33.594 --> 01:16:35.221
All men but you.

1066
01:16:36.013 --> 01:16:38.061
And why am I to be spared?

1067
01:16:41.352 --> 01:16:42.979
Why do you think?

1068
01:17:18.474 --> 01:17:20.476
Lovely evening, isn't it?

1069
01:17:22.478 --> 01:17:24.572
A storm later, so they say.

1070
01:17:25.856 --> 01:17:28.780
Estella, Mr Drummle
requires your presence.


1071
01:17:32.822 --> 01:17:34.120
Urgently.

1072
01:18:15.533 --> 01:18:16.705
Hello?

1073
01:18:18.035 --> 01:18:20.037
Herbert?

1074
01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:23.463
You're back early!

1075
01:18:23.959 --> 01:18:25.461
Who's there?

1076
01:18:46.191 --> 01:18:47.408
Who are you?

1077
01:18:47.525 --> 01:18:50.529
Wait, wait, wait. Shh. Wait.

1078
01:18:50.737 --> 01:18:51.909
How'd you get in here?

1079
01:19:00.497 --> 01:19:01.749
Good God.

1080
01:19:10.758 --> 01:19:12.385
What are you...

1081
01:19:16.932 --> 01:19:19.811
You acted noble, my boy.

1082
01:19:21.102 --> 01:19:23.946
Noble and I have never forgot it.

1083
01:19:24.147 --> 01:19:27.777
Look, if you're grateful to me
for what I did as a boy,


1084
01:19:28.944 --> 01:19:30.742
it's not necessary.

1085
01:19:31.238 --> 01:19:34.708
- Really. You must understand.
- What must I understand?


1086
01:19:35.784 --> 01:19:38.458
That I cannot renew
our acquaintance.


1087
01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.246
My life has changed since then.

1088
01:19:41.122 --> 01:19:43.124
Now, I'm glad that you're well
and you've repented.


1089
01:19:43.124 --> 01:19:45.126
But really, you must go.

1090
01:19:45.919 --> 01:19:47.136
Please.

1091
01:19:47.671 --> 01:19:49.639
How about a drink first?

1092
01:19:50.131 --> 01:19:51.508
Before I go.

1093
01:19:56.098 --> 01:19:57.224
How have you been living?

1094
01:19:58.642 --> 01:20:00.315
A sheep farmer,

1095
01:20:01.979 --> 01:20:04.448
stock breeder, in the New World.

1096
01:20:05.774 --> 01:20:07.776
Many a thousand mile off.

1097
01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.948
- You've done well?
- I've done wonderful well.


1098
01:20:13.657 --> 01:20:16.035
Seems, you've done well, too.

1099
01:20:17.703 --> 01:20:18.795
Yes.

1100
01:20:19.162 --> 01:20:21.290
Yes. No, I have. Thank you.

1101
01:20:21.498 --> 01:20:23.421
I would like, if I may,

1102
01:20:24.251 --> 01:20:25.252
to give you this gift.

1103
01:20:27.045 --> 01:20:29.389
A token. For old times.

1104
01:20:34.803 --> 01:20:36.305
Before you go.

1105
01:20:50.863 --> 01:20:52.536
There's your gift.

1106
01:20:54.074 --> 01:20:58.750
Might a varmint make so bold
as to ask you, how you've done well...


1107
01:20:59.538 --> 01:21:01.381
Since we were anthem marshes?

1108
01:21:03.042 --> 01:21:04.089
<i>Mmmm?</i>

1109
01:21:04.835 --> 01:21:05.836
I've come into some property.

1110
01:21:06.045 --> 01:21:09.424
And might he ask whose property?

1111
01:21:09.548 --> 01:21:11.050
No, I cannot say her name.
There are conditions.


1112
01:21:11.133 --> 01:21:12.180
Conditions?

1113
01:21:12.343 --> 01:21:14.937
Could I make a
guess as to your income?

1114
01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:18.648
Might the first figure be a...

1115
01:21:19.392 --> 01:21:20.393
A five?

1116
01:21:20.477 --> 01:21:22.730
- How could you...
- And you would have had a guardian?


1117
01:21:23.021 --> 01:21:26.400
A lawyer, maybe,
with a name beginning with a...


1118
01:21:26.483 --> 01:21:27.575
<i>J?</i>

1119
01:21:27.984 --> 01:21:32.491
A J, perhaps, who might have sent me
your address when I landed in Portsmouth?


1120
01:21:33.824 --> 01:21:35.792
Mr Jaggers, perhaps?

1121
01:21:37.953 --> 01:21:39.705
Yes, dear boy. Yes.

1122
01:21:40.081 --> 01:21:42.504
I've made a gentleman of you.

1123
01:21:47.546 --> 01:21:49.423
I swore that time

1124
01:21:49.507 --> 01:21:51.509
as sure as I ever earned a guinea,

1125
01:21:51.967 --> 01:21:53.344
that guinea should go to you.

1126
01:21:53.427 --> 01:21:54.470
No...

1127
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:57.599
I lived rough that you
should live smooth.


1128
01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:02.772
I worked hard that you
should be above work.


1129
01:22:04.564 --> 01:22:05.941
I made you!

1130
01:22:07.317 --> 01:22:08.819
I'm your, your father, Pip.

1131
01:22:08.902 --> 01:22:10.950
No. No, no, no.
You are not my father!


1132
01:22:11.029 --> 01:22:12.451
No, no.

1133
01:22:13.281 --> 01:22:14.828
Your second father, then.

1134
01:22:15.576 --> 01:22:17.795
You're my son. No...

1135
01:22:18.037 --> 01:22:21.007
No, you're more to
me than any son.


1136
01:22:22.375 --> 01:22:24.753
Look at you, dear boy!

1137
01:22:25.461 --> 01:22:28.385
Look at these lodgings.
They're fit for a lord.


1138
01:22:28.464 --> 01:22:32.219
And yeah,
this watch and this ring


1139
01:22:32.301 --> 01:22:34.804
and your linen and your clothes.

1140
01:22:35.930 --> 01:22:38.683
And your, your books, too.

1141
01:22:39.308 --> 01:22:40.480
Oh!

1142
01:22:40.935 --> 01:22:43.030
You read them all, have you?

1143
01:22:44.022 --> 01:22:45.524
You shall read them to me...

1144
01:22:46.483 --> 01:22:48.906
And I shall be so proud,
to think that


1145
01:22:49.862 --> 01:22:52.866
I'm the maker of such a man.

1146
01:22:56.368 --> 01:22:59.542
I must sleep, long and sound.

1147
01:23:00.164 --> 01:23:02.463
It's a long time since I slept.

1148
01:23:03.585 --> 01:23:05.758
You'll keep watch, dear boy?

1149
01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:08.139
Cos, look here. Here.

1150
01:23:10.133 --> 01:23:12.010
Caution is necessary.

1151
01:23:12.677 --> 01:23:14.475
I was sent for life.

1152
01:23:14.929 --> 01:23:18.604
It's death to come back.
I should be hanged if took.


1153
01:23:19.017 --> 01:23:20.815
You risked your life to come to me?

1154
01:23:20.977 --> 01:23:22.854
That's right, dear boy.

1155
01:23:23.521 --> 01:23:26.867
I... I don't even
know your name.


1156
01:23:27.693 --> 01:23:28.945
<i>Magwitch.</i>

1157
01:23:29.028 --> 01:23:31.497
Abel Magwitch.

1158
01:23:51.635 --> 01:23:54.104
<i>Well, is it true?
Do not commit yourself.</i>


1159
01:23:54.262 --> 01:23:55.889
<i>Do not tell me anything,
I do not want...</i>


1160
01:23:55.889 --> 01:24:00.065
- Is what I've been told true?
- "Told" implies verbal communication.


1161
01:24:01.019 --> 01:24:04.944
You cannot have verbal communication
with a man in New South Wales.


1162
01:24:05.023 --> 01:24:07.322
- I was always led to believe...
- Nothing.


1163
01:24:07.985 --> 01:24:09.077
Nothing.

1164
01:24:09.153 --> 01:24:12.248
You believed what you chose to believe.
Mmm-hmm?


1165
01:24:13.825 --> 01:24:15.919
It's not my responsibility.

1166
01:24:16.369 --> 01:24:19.418
Now, I understand you have
an uncle staying with you.


1167
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:22.087
Yes? Yes?

1168
01:24:23.918 --> 01:24:25.261
- Yes.
- Right.


1169
01:24:26.087 --> 01:24:28.465
May I, suggest you buy him
some new clothes,


1170
01:24:29.173 --> 01:24:32.097
advise him to spend most of his time
in your rooms


1171
01:24:32.468 --> 01:24:34.596
and perhaps have a haircut.

1172
01:24:34.887 --> 01:24:36.059
Yes?

1173
01:24:36.264 --> 01:24:40.896
Meanwhile, if you are writing to
your friend in New South Wales,


1174
01:24:41.395 --> 01:24:43.739
you may choose to send him that.

1175
01:24:43.856 --> 01:24:45.324
The balance of our accounts.

1176
01:24:45.816 --> 01:24:47.239
Mmm-hmm?

1177
01:24:47.777 --> 01:24:50.747
My services are ended.

1178
01:24:52.615 --> 01:24:54.288
Good day, Mr Pip.

1179
01:24:59.038 --> 01:25:01.587
All that time, in Satis House,
I was just a...


1180
01:25:02.667 --> 01:25:04.965
A mechanical heart to practise on.

1181
01:25:06.462 --> 01:25:08.681
Estella was never meant
for me at all.


1182
01:25:09.465 --> 01:25:12.685
And you, my "guardian",
have known this all along.


1183
01:25:16.264 --> 01:25:17.641
Well...

1184
01:25:18.892 --> 01:25:22.271
You may as well hear this from me
as anyone else.


1185
01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:24.319
Um...

1186
01:25:24.398 --> 01:25:26.651
The Spider has played his hand.

1187
01:25:41.499 --> 01:25:43.342
Can I help you?

1188
01:25:44.294 --> 01:25:47.673
- Open this gate, Drummle, or I swear...
- Why, it's the smithy's boy!


1189
01:25:49.090 --> 01:25:51.013
Don't lose your temper,
smithy's boy.


1190
01:25:51.843 --> 01:25:54.437
Seems to me
you've lost quite enough already.


1191
01:26:07.150 --> 01:26:08.618
Pip?

1192
01:26:09.194 --> 01:26:11.574
- Pip.
- Oh, enough!


1193
01:26:13.158 --> 01:26:15.707
What I have to say to Estella
I will say before you.


1194
01:26:16.703 --> 01:26:18.797
But, Miss Havisham...

1195
01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:22.709
When you first took
me from my home,


1196
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:27.180
I came as a kind of servant,
to gratify a whim and be paid for it.


1197
01:26:27.381 --> 01:26:28.428
Yes.

1198
01:26:28.507 --> 01:26:31.727
And when I fell into my mistake of
imagining that you were my benefactor...


1199
01:26:31.802 --> 01:26:34.225
Yes, I... Let you go on.

1200
01:26:36.890 --> 01:26:38.233
Was that kind?

1201
01:26:39.518 --> 01:26:42.237
Kind? Who am I to be kind?

1202
01:26:45.190 --> 01:26:47.693
No, it amused me...

1203
01:26:48.902 --> 01:26:50.779
To punish my relations.

1204
01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:55.119
You were adequately paid, I believe.
What else do you want?


1205
01:26:59.665 --> 01:27:00.712
Estella.

1206
01:27:07.798 --> 01:27:09.596
You know I love you.

1207
01:27:10.134 --> 01:27:12.933
I have loved you since
I first saw you in this house.


1208
01:27:14.138 --> 01:27:18.484
Foolishly, I had hoped that Miss Havisham
had meant us for each other.


1209
01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.688
Clearly the idea was absurd,

1210
01:27:22.271 --> 01:27:24.606
and I hope Miss Havisham will take
what pleasure she can


1211
01:27:24.606 --> 01:27:27.951
in knowing that I am as unhappy
as she ever meant me to be.


1212
01:27:29.361 --> 01:27:31.284
These are sentiments,

1213
01:27:31.947 --> 01:27:34.667
emotions that I am
unable to comprehend.


1214
01:27:35.076 --> 01:27:37.287
When you say you love me,

1215
01:27:37.287 --> 01:27:41.383
I understand it as a form of words
but it touches nothing here.


1216
01:27:41.499 --> 01:27:43.922
- I don't believe you.
- Did I not warn you?


1217
01:27:44.210 --> 01:27:45.804
- Yes.
- Did you not think I meant it?


1218
01:27:45.963 --> 01:27:48.682
- No. It's not natural!
- It is natural in me!


1219
01:27:48.758 --> 01:27:50.760
And yet still I love you.

1220
01:27:53.387 --> 01:27:56.015
I know that I'll never
call you mine, Estella,


1221
01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.517
yet still I love you.

1222
01:27:59.143 --> 01:28:02.693
I love you and I beg you
do not marry Bentley Drummle.


1223
01:28:03.647 --> 01:28:06.651
Someone else, anyone,
but not that brute.


1224
01:28:06.776 --> 01:28:09.325
Too late. It's too late.

1225
01:28:10.988 --> 01:28:13.032
I am going to marry him.

1226
01:28:13.032 --> 01:28:15.707
The preparations are
already under way.


1227
01:28:17.412 --> 01:28:19.915
- You can't let Miss Havisham...
- it is my own act.


1228
01:28:20.332 --> 01:28:23.632
Miss Havisham has urged me to wait,
to reconsider.


1229
01:28:25.670 --> 01:28:27.718
But I am tired of my life.

1230
01:28:30.133 --> 01:28:32.011
We will do well enough.

1231
01:28:37.016 --> 01:28:38.734
Give me your hand.

1232
01:28:43.439 --> 01:28:45.237
Be happy, Pip.

1233
01:28:46.109 --> 01:28:48.032
This will pass in time.

1234
01:28:48.111 --> 01:28:50.159
I'll be out of your
thoughts in a week.


1235
01:28:52.198 --> 01:28:53.950
Out of my thoughts?

1236
01:28:54.367 --> 01:28:56.166
You're in every thought.

1237
01:28:57.246 --> 01:28:59.248
You're part of my existence.

1238
01:29:00.124 --> 01:29:01.592
You're part of me.

1239
01:29:02.042 --> 01:29:04.044
You're in every thought,

1240
01:29:04.211 --> 01:29:07.055
in every line I have ever read since
I first came here.


1241
01:29:08.215 --> 01:29:10.050
You're in the river,

1242
01:29:10.050 --> 01:29:11.893
the sails of ships,

1243
01:29:12.344 --> 01:29:14.096
the sea, the clouds,

1244
01:29:14.805 --> 01:29:16.273
the stones of London.

1245
01:29:18.142 --> 01:29:21.568
Until the last hours of my life,
you will remain in me...


1246
01:29:22.188 --> 01:29:25.032
Part of the little good,
part of the evil.


1247
01:29:26.776 --> 01:29:29.325
And I will always think of the good.

1248
01:29:38.330 --> 01:29:40.003
Goodbye. God bless you.

1249
01:29:41.041 --> 01:29:44.136
So proud, so hard.

1250
01:29:46.172 --> 01:29:48.266
I am what you have made me!

1251
01:29:49.758 --> 01:29:51.431
You are my mother,

1252
01:29:51.635 --> 01:29:53.933
and yet I have never
seen your face by daylight.


1253
01:29:54.972 --> 01:29:58.772
Since I was a baby, you taught me
that there was no such thing as daylight,


1254
01:29:58.851 --> 01:30:00.945
that it had blighted you...

1255
01:30:02.146 --> 01:30:04.194
And it would blight me,
too, if I let it.


1256
01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:08.452
Well...

1257
01:30:09.821 --> 01:30:11.789
I am what you made me.

1258
01:30:15.702 --> 01:30:17.921
This is what you made me.

1259
01:30:18.788 --> 01:30:20.132
Estella...

1260
01:30:21.042 --> 01:30:22.669
Come with me now.

1261
01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:09.676
I'd like to help Mr Pocket.

1262
01:31:09.676 --> 01:31:10.893
He has been a loyal
and decent friend


1263
01:31:10.969 --> 01:31:13.563
and I'd like to use the money
that remains to do one good thing.


1264
01:31:13.763 --> 01:31:17.017
I'd like to purchase him a position.
Without his knowledge.


1265
01:31:17.183 --> 01:31:21.529
Allowing for debts, which are substantial,
I might add, that's 500 pounds, sir.


1266
01:31:22.146 --> 01:31:24.774
- All invested in a friend?
- Yes, yes. Every last penny.


1267
01:31:24.857 --> 01:31:26.074
What's your advice?

1268
01:31:28.569 --> 01:31:31.789
Well, sir, if I was in the office, I would
suggest that you take that 500 pounds,


1269
01:31:31.864 --> 01:31:33.411
and choose your bridge.

1270
01:31:33.491 --> 01:31:35.743
There are 6 to choose from up
as high as Chelsea Reach


1271
01:31:35.743 --> 01:31:37.541
and throw the money off it.

1272
01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:41.501
You'll lose it just the same,
but it will be quicker and less painful.


1273
01:31:42.711 --> 01:31:45.214
Those would be my sentiments,
in the office.


1274
01:31:46.214 --> 01:31:48.467
But your home sentiments, your...

1275
01:31:49.217 --> 01:31:50.719
Your Walworth sentiments?

1276
01:31:51.845 --> 01:31:54.519
My Walworth sentiments...

1277
01:31:55.307 --> 01:31:56.934
Would be...

1278
01:31:58.351 --> 01:32:00.820
I'm gonna see what I can do.

1279
01:32:22.625 --> 01:32:24.924
- Let go of me!
- Magwitch!


1280
01:32:26.172 --> 01:32:28.426
Leave him! Magwitch!

1281
01:32:29.384 --> 01:32:31.432
He wishes to buy us a house!

1282
01:32:31.678 --> 01:32:33.146
In Hyde Park!

1283
01:32:33.388 --> 01:32:36.437
- A coach, horses...
- Can't you accept?


1284
01:32:37.267 --> 01:32:38.610
How can I?

1285
01:32:40.437 --> 01:32:42.815
I've seen him try to murder a man.
He might have murdered you.


1286
01:32:44.608 --> 01:32:47.327
And yet, he risked his
life to find you.


1287
01:32:47.944 --> 01:32:50.572
He says I am the son
he's never had.


1288
01:32:51.156 --> 01:32:52.954
The idea appals me, Herbert,

1289
01:32:54.618 --> 01:32:57.337
but even so, he must not be captured...

1290
01:32:57.454 --> 01:32:58.956
Gentlemen.

1291
01:33:01.833 --> 01:33:05.088
Now, I ain't gonna tell you my life
like a song or a story book,


1292
01:33:05.254 --> 01:33:07.302
but give it to you short and handy.

1293
01:33:07.382 --> 01:33:10.727
In jail, out of jail.
In jail, out of jail.


1294
01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:15.016
That's my life...
Until I met my boy here.


1295
01:33:16.392 --> 01:33:19.236
I've been done everything
to except hanged.


1296
01:33:19.978 --> 01:33:22.322
I've ramped and begged
and thieved, poached...


1297
01:33:22.398 --> 01:33:25.026
Anything that doesn't pay
and leads to trouble.


1298
01:33:26.485 --> 01:33:28.908
And then a matter of 20 years ago,

1299
01:33:29.947 --> 01:33:33.326
when I was out of money and out of luck,
not that I'd been in it much,


1300
01:33:33.992 --> 01:33:35.369
I met a man.

1301
01:33:36.036 --> 01:33:37.583
At Epsom races.

1302
01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:40.128
His name...

1303
01:33:40.457 --> 01:33:41.583
was Compeyson.

1304
01:33:41.667 --> 01:33:43.590
<i>- Compeysun?
- Compeyson.</i>


1305
01:33:45.754 --> 01:33:47.177
I'm sorry. Go on.

1306
01:33:48.675 --> 01:33:50.973
<i>A gentleman was Compeyson,</i>

1307
01:33:51.594 --> 01:33:55.189
<i>a smooth one, good-looking too,
went to boarding school.</i>


1308
01:33:55.515 --> 01:34:00.272
<i>He was younger than me but he'd
got craft and he'd got learning.</i>


1309
01:34:00.855 --> 01:34:03.028
<i>He and his missus had a plan...</i>

1310
01:34:03.524 --> 01:34:07.870
Involving the defrauding of
a certain lady by her half-brother.


1311
01:34:07.987 --> 01:34:11.161
It weren't much of a plan to my mind,
but I played my part...


1312
01:34:12.032 --> 01:34:14.000
<i>I played my part in a small way.</i>

1313
01:34:14.618 --> 01:34:15.995
<i>I can't say I'm
proud of it.</i>


1314
01:34:16.370 --> 01:34:17.963
Well done, Abel.

1315
01:34:22.209 --> 01:34:24.177
I had a missus, too, at that time.

1316
01:34:24.837 --> 01:34:26.714
- You were married?
- No matter.


1317
01:34:36.016 --> 01:34:39.065
That was a dark time,
that time with Compeyson.


1318
01:34:39.144 --> 01:34:41.938
Always in debt to him,
always under his thumb,


1319
01:34:41.938 --> 01:34:43.611
always getting into danger,

1320
01:34:43.732 --> 01:34:46.611
always working, for years and years,

1321
01:34:47.195 --> 01:34:50.415
till I was his black slave.

1322
01:34:55.995 --> 01:34:58.919
The short of it is,
we got committed for felony,


1323
01:34:59.415 --> 01:35:01.759
putting forged notes into circulation.

1324
01:35:01.834 --> 01:35:05.634
"Separate defences," Compeyson says.
"No communication."


1325
01:35:06.797 --> 01:35:11.595
I sold everything but the clothes
on my back so I could get Jaggers,


1326
01:35:11.595 --> 01:35:13.305
for all the good it did me.

1327
01:35:13.305 --> 01:35:14.852
Says the counsel for Compeyson,

1328
01:35:14.932 --> 01:35:18.106
wasn't he the younger
and well brought up and of a good school?


1329
01:35:18.268 --> 01:35:21.693
- Wasn't he...
- A gentleman of a county of Shropshire...


1330
01:35:22.064 --> 01:35:23.111
A gentleman?

1331
01:35:23.357 --> 01:35:26.361
Given your persistence
and your malign influence...


1332
01:35:26.443 --> 01:35:28.612
And when the verdict came,
wasn't it Compeyson


1333
01:35:28.612 --> 01:35:31.786
<i>as was recommended for mercy
on account of good character</i>


1334
01:35:31.865 --> 01:35:36.463
and bad company and all the damn'd lies
he'd given up against me?


1335
01:35:36.996 --> 01:35:39.123
And wasn't it me as
never got a word...


1336
01:35:39.123 --> 01:35:40.875
- But to find you guilty.
- Guilty.


1337
01:35:42.585 --> 01:35:44.963
- Guilty.
- Order! Order!


1338
01:35:45.672 --> 01:35:46.969
Guilty.

1339
01:35:48.049 --> 01:35:49.767
For how long?

1340
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:52.309
14 years.

1341
01:35:53.764 --> 01:35:55.311
He got two.

1342
01:35:55.641 --> 01:35:58.485
And a few months on,
he turns up on my prison ship.


1343
01:35:58.811 --> 01:36:01.405
I swore to the Lord,
I'd smash his face in...


1344
01:36:02.606 --> 01:36:03.983
And I did.

1345
01:36:04.275 --> 01:36:06.403
And then, thinking, hoping,
that he'd drowned,


1346
01:36:06.485 --> 01:36:08.203
I swam to the shore

1347
01:36:08.279 --> 01:36:11.783
and was hiding among the graves there,
envying them that were in them...


1348
01:36:13.033 --> 01:36:15.161
And my boy here found me.

1349
01:36:17.413 --> 01:36:18.630
My boy.

1350
01:36:21.876 --> 01:36:23.002
- Is he dead?
- Who?


1351
01:36:23.086 --> 01:36:24.546
Compeyson.

1352
01:36:24.546 --> 01:36:26.924
<i>He'll wish I am,
if he's alive.</i>


1353
01:36:27.882 --> 01:36:30.226
And he'll wish he was,
if I find him.


1354
01:36:31.469 --> 01:36:34.189
- And the lady he defrauded. Her name was...
- 'Avisham.


1355
01:36:36.434 --> 01:36:38.061
Miss 'Avisham.

1356
01:36:55.494 --> 01:36:57.838
<i>I need you to tell me
about Compeyson.</i>


1357
01:36:58.789 --> 01:37:01.042
<i>Clever fellow Dangerous.</i>

1358
01:37:01.334 --> 01:37:03.757
<i>- Is he still alive?
- To my knowledge, yes.</i>


1359
01:37:04.879 --> 01:37:07.883
I would strongly advise your uncle
to pack his bags.


1360
01:37:08.175 --> 01:37:10.260
If he's found, he will hang.

1361
01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:13.139
And it's fair to presume that
Mr Compeyson does not wish him well.


1362
01:37:13.221 --> 01:37:14.932
Abel's come back!

1363
01:37:14.932 --> 01:37:16.730
- You told me he'd never come back.
- Calm down, Molly.


1364
01:37:16.809 --> 01:37:18.728
He mustn't find out, ever.
Poor, poor, Abel.


1365
01:37:18.728 --> 01:37:21.606
What did you make me do?
It was wicked, wicked!


1366
01:37:21.606 --> 01:37:23.700
Abel will never find out.
I'll shall ensure that.


1367
01:37:24.233 --> 01:37:27.407
- Did I not swear at the time...
- You swore that she'd be safe!


1368
01:37:27.570 --> 01:37:29.413
You swore she'd have
a brand-new life!


1369
01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:34.418
Jaggers, you must tell me.

1370
01:37:35.745 --> 01:37:37.418
Who is this "she"?

1371
01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:46.923
Magwitch and Molly had a child.

1372
01:37:47.382 --> 01:37:49.726
<i>A girl. A pretty thing.</i>

1373
01:37:49.926 --> 01:37:52.930
<i>But Molly was a fierce one,
wild and passionate like her husband,</i>


1374
01:37:53.388 --> 01:37:56.018
<i>and not a woman to let injustice
go unpunished.</i>


1375
01:37:56.643 --> 01:37:58.862
<i>Compeyson, of course,
was safe in prison.</i>


1376
01:37:59.270 --> 01:38:01.443
<i>His wife, however,
was not safe.</i>


1377
01:38:01.523 --> 01:38:02.991
<i>Molly found hen.</i>

1378
01:38:03.066 --> 01:38:04.534
<i>A terrible crime.</i>

1379
01:38:08.488 --> 01:38:10.035
Cold-blooded and ruthless,

1380
01:38:10.657 --> 01:38:12.284
assuming, of course,
that Molly did it.


1381
01:38:13.952 --> 01:38:19.004
But to be guilty and to be found guilty
are different things.


1382
01:38:28.717 --> 01:38:32.688
Put the case that a woman accused
of murder went to see her


1383
01:38:33.805 --> 01:38:35.682
legal adviser...

1384
01:38:37.309 --> 01:38:41.530
And put the case that same legal
adviser holds a trust to find a child


1385
01:38:41.647 --> 01:38:45.698
for an eccentric and rich woman
to adopt and bring up.


1386
01:38:47.946 --> 01:38:53.168
Put the case that the legal adviser
said to the mother of the child...


1387
01:38:54.286 --> 01:38:58.132
Give the child into my hands,
I will do my best to get you off.


1388
01:38:58.957 --> 01:39:01.585
If you are saved, your child is saved.

1389
01:39:02.169 --> 01:39:05.673
If you are lost,
your child is still saved.


1390
01:39:09.009 --> 01:39:12.013
And the child was your fee?

1391
01:39:14.931 --> 01:39:16.854
And what of Magwitch?

1392
01:39:19.729 --> 01:39:22.357
- The father was told...
- No! You say his name!


1393
01:39:25.193 --> 01:39:29.495
Magwitch was told that
the child had died.


1394
01:39:30.199 --> 01:39:31.701
Consumption.

1395
01:39:38.081 --> 01:39:41.426
Put the case that she is now safe
and wealthy,


1396
01:39:41.543 --> 01:39:43.511
and about to marry
one of the richest men in England.


1397
01:39:43.629 --> 01:39:45.427
And one of the vilest.

1398
01:39:46.423 --> 01:39:48.926
Estella is not the Spider's reward.

1399
01:39:50.719 --> 01:39:53.097
Estella is his punishment.

1400
01:39:55.808 --> 01:39:57.401
And you arranged it.

1401
01:39:57.601 --> 01:39:59.729
As instructed by my client.

1402
01:40:00.688 --> 01:40:02.406
Only as instructed.

1403
01:40:05.944 --> 01:40:08.538
<i>And what did Miss Havisham
want with the child?</i>


1404
01:40:08.863 --> 01:40:11.787
<i>Well, you, uh,
must ask her yourself.</i>


1405
01:40:34.098 --> 01:40:35.941
<i>What did you want with the child?</i>

1406
01:40:39.144 --> 01:40:42.945
I just wanted a little girl,
to love, and to rear,


1407
01:40:43.942 --> 01:40:45.660
to save from my fate.

1408
01:40:47.445 --> 01:40:49.698
<i>One night he brought her here...</i>

1409
01:40:50.991 --> 01:40:53.335
<i>And I called her Estella.</i>

1410
01:40:54.578 --> 01:40:58.082
<i>Pip, she was so gentle.
She was so beautiful.</i>


1411
01:41:02.168 --> 01:41:04.463
<i>Pip, believe me,
when she first came to me,</i>


1412
01:41:04.463 --> 01:41:06.807
<i>I just meant to save her
from misery like my own.</i>


1413
01:41:07.925 --> 01:41:12.101
<i>But as she grew more beautiful,
I gradually did worse.</i>


1414
01:41:13.139 --> 01:41:17.565
<i>And with my praises
and my jewels and my teachings,</i>


1415
01:41:18.394 --> 01:41:21.273
<i>I... I stole her heart away...</i>

1416
01:41:23.149 --> 01:41:25.278
<i>And put ice in its place.</i>

1417
01:41:27.905 --> 01:41:31.785
<i>I stole her heart away...</i>

1418
01:41:34.161 --> 01:41:36.255
<i>And put ice in its place.</i>

1419
01:41:46.006 --> 01:41:48.509
Pip, are you very unhappy?

1420
01:41:51.179 --> 01:41:53.181
Do you hate me very much?

1421
01:41:53.514 --> 01:41:57.314
I know you must hate me,
but if you can ever bear to forgive me...


1422
01:42:59.917 --> 01:43:02.761
Forgive me.
Forgive me. Forgive me.


1423
01:43:03.546 --> 01:43:05.423
Forgive me. Forgive me.

1424
01:43:06.257 --> 01:43:07.634
Forgive me.

1425
01:43:24.985 --> 01:43:28.286
I won't deny there have been
too many secrets.


1426
01:43:30.491 --> 01:43:32.619
But who would the truth serve?

1427
01:43:36.622 --> 01:43:38.295
If Estella...

1428
01:43:39.125 --> 01:43:41.674
Were to discover that her
father is a convict,


1429
01:43:41.878 --> 01:43:44.131
her mother a murderess,

1430
01:43:45.298 --> 01:43:47.801
would she thank you,
do you think?


1431
01:43:55.892 --> 01:43:57.144
Hmm?

1432
01:44:08.321 --> 01:44:10.620
Sir. A note for you.

1433
01:44:11.242 --> 01:44:13.745
Most important,
the gentleman said.


1434
01:44:39.354 --> 01:44:41.356
Bastard! Where are you?

1435
01:44:41.356 --> 01:44:44.109
Show your bitchy face!

1436
01:45:01.878 --> 01:45:04.051
- Did you destroy my note?
- I did.


1437
01:45:04.381 --> 01:45:06.429
Best not to leave any evidence.
They're on to him, Mr Pip.


1438
01:45:09.010 --> 01:45:10.387
Police.

1439
01:45:11.596 --> 01:45:14.057
The reward on his head
is substantial.


1440
01:45:14.057 --> 01:45:17.732
Every copper and cutthroat in London
is on the hunt for your Antipodean Uncle.


1441
01:45:18.145 --> 01:45:20.443
It was all your Mr Herbert and I could do
to get him out in time.


1442
01:45:20.689 --> 01:45:21.815
How do we get him away?

1443
01:45:21.898 --> 01:45:25.619
There's a steamer leaving
for Antwerp at midnight.


1444
01:45:26.111 --> 01:45:28.955
You and your Uncle
find a way onto it.

1445
01:45:30.448 --> 01:45:32.577
Portable property, Mr Pip.

1446
01:45:32.702 --> 01:45:36.206
Try and lay hold of portable property.

1447
01:45:37.915 --> 01:45:41.044
All is well, Handel. He's quite safe here.
Though he is keen to see you.


1448
01:45:41.586 --> 01:45:43.259
- Goodness! What happened to your hands?
- Where is he?


1449
01:45:45.465 --> 01:45:48.594
Listen, the steamer departs at midnight.
We'll intercept it shortly after.


1450
01:45:48.677 --> 01:45:51.351
The further from the city we can get,
the safer it will be.


1451
01:45:53.265 --> 01:45:54.437
It's not long now.

1452
01:45:54.975 --> 01:45:56.443
Thank 'ee, my boy.

1453
01:45:57.936 --> 01:45:59.404
- I love you.
- Herbert...


1454
01:46:03.442 --> 01:46:06.070
Clara, I will return your
fiancee safely, I swear.


1455
01:46:09.198 --> 01:46:10.490
Apologies, Handel.

1456
01:46:10.490 --> 01:46:12.663
She thinks you have rather
a malign influence on me.


1457
01:46:12.993 --> 01:46:14.621
And she's right.

1458
01:46:15.246 --> 01:46:17.044
Herbert, are you sure you want to...

1459
01:46:17.749 --> 01:46:20.218
Handel, I don't think I've ever been
more excited in my life!


1460
01:46:40.648 --> 01:46:43.026
"The rain pattered dismally
against the panes,


1461
01:46:43.651 --> 01:46:46.154
"and my candle was nearly burnt out,

1462
01:46:46.654 --> 01:46:48.907
"when, by the glimmer
of the half-extinguished light,


1463
01:46:49.782 --> 01:46:53.787
"I saw the dull yellow eye
of the creature open...


1464
01:46:55.162 --> 01:46:56.836
"It breathed."

1465
01:46:56.998 --> 01:46:58.875
Something wrong, Abel?

1466
01:46:59.417 --> 01:47:00.760
Not a bit of it.

1467
01:47:00.835 --> 01:47:04.510
To sit here and have my smoke
along with my dear boy...


1468
01:47:08.843 --> 01:47:10.891
I had a little child once.

1469
01:47:11.888 --> 01:47:13.856
I didn't tell you afore.

1470
01:47:14.349 --> 01:47:16.772
Pretty little thing. A girl.

1471
01:47:18.186 --> 01:47:19.905
Died while I was in prison.

1472
01:47:21.524 --> 01:47:24.778
But there weren't a day,
as I was rotting on that hulk,


1473
01:47:25.361 --> 01:47:27.659
when I didn't think on her face

1474
01:47:28.239 --> 01:47:30.867
and what a dear,
pretty thing she were.


1475
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:33.453
And when I saw you
on them marshes,


1476
01:47:33.619 --> 01:47:36.042
well, you brought her to my mind.

1477
01:47:36.872 --> 01:47:39.672
Maybe that's why I took
to you so strong.


1478
01:47:41.503 --> 01:47:45.303
I hope I've been a friend to you
this little time we've had.


1479
01:47:48.969 --> 01:47:51.063
You speak as if we're parting.

1480
01:47:51.138 --> 01:47:53.561
In an hour, we'll be safe aboard.

1481
01:47:55.976 --> 01:47:59.062
We can no more see to the bottom
of the next few hours


1482
01:47:59.062 --> 01:48:01.235
than we can see to the
bottom of this river.


1483
01:48:02.357 --> 01:48:04.451
Which I catches in my hand.

1484
01:48:04.776 --> 01:48:08.077
And it's run through
my fingers and gone.


1485
01:48:09.991 --> 01:48:11.243
You see?

1486
01:48:13.244 --> 01:48:14.416
Listen!

1487
01:48:15.663 --> 01:48:17.131
Can you hear?

1488
01:48:20.878 --> 01:48:23.597
Get the oars.
We'll head down the river and wait.


1489
01:49:21.857 --> 01:49:23.325
Go, boys. Go!

1490
01:49:31.534 --> 01:49:32.786
Come on, boys, row!

1491
01:49:47.176 --> 01:49:50.055
- Stop! Stop that boat!
- There they are!


1492
01:49:50.972 --> 01:49:52.645
Go on, boys!
Put your back into it!


1493
01:49:53.141 --> 01:49:54.518
Row!

1494
01:50:00.523 --> 01:50:02.651
You have a returned convict there!

1495
01:50:02.942 --> 01:50:04.865
His name is Abel Magwitch.

1496
01:50:05.695 --> 01:50:09.290
I apprehend the man,
and call upon him to surrender!


1497
01:50:10.158 --> 01:50:11.284
Keep going!

1498
01:50:12.493 --> 01:50:13.870
Compeyson.

1499
01:50:13.953 --> 01:50:15.125
Row!

1500
01:50:17.331 --> 01:50:19.333
Stop! Stop that boat!

1501
01:50:24.923 --> 01:50:26.425
Nearly there!

1502
01:50:27.010 --> 01:50:28.683
Turn!

1503
01:50:29.554 --> 01:50:30.897
Come on, boys!
They're closing on us!


1504
01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:33.607
No! No!

1505
01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:35.397
Get off!

1506
01:50:37.312 --> 01:50:39.064
Handel! Handel!

1507
01:50:45.403 --> 01:50:47.076
- Hang on!
- Magwitch, grab my hand!


1508
01:50:48.656 --> 01:50:50.374
- Look out, Pip!
- Aargh!


1509
01:51:02.003 --> 01:51:03.175
Pip!

1510
01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:09.303
- Magwitch!
- We have to get over there!


1511
01:51:09.303 --> 01:51:10.429
No!

1512
01:51:15.185 --> 01:51:16.607
Magwitch!

1513
01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:45.595
Up you come. Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.


1514
01:51:47.843 --> 01:51:49.470
Just get in there!

1515
01:51:49.762 --> 01:51:51.059
Come on.

1516
01:51:56.310 --> 01:51:57.778
- Abel!
- Handel, don't.


1517
01:51:57.937 --> 01:51:59.154
No.

1518
01:52:00.439 --> 01:52:01.692
Abel!

1519
01:52:12.869 --> 01:52:14.246
All is lost.

1520
01:52:15.163 --> 01:52:16.415
All is gone.

1521
01:52:16.832 --> 01:52:19.176
You've let the whole thing
slip through your fingers.


1522
01:52:19.501 --> 01:52:21.174
- Will he be tried?
- Yes.


1523
01:52:21.336 --> 01:52:24.055
He will be tried and found guilty, too,
and hanged.


1524
01:52:24.172 --> 01:52:27.643
The best that we can hope for
is that he dies before it comes to that.


1525
01:52:29.137 --> 01:52:32.482
The money, the land,
are all forfeit to the crown.


1526
01:52:34.809 --> 01:52:36.686
You have nothing, Pip.

1527
01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:38.397
Not a penny.

1528
01:52:39.188 --> 01:52:40.610
Can we keep that from him?

1529
01:52:42.859 --> 01:52:44.657
I'd like him to think
I'm a gentleman still.


1530
01:52:46.029 --> 01:52:50.001
I must, amongst you,
single out a miserable man


1531
01:52:50.117 --> 01:52:55.044
who, after many years of living
a peaceable and honest life in exile,


1532
01:52:55.539 --> 01:52:57.667
decided, in a fatal moment,

1533
01:52:57.916 --> 01:53:02.137
to return to the country
where he was expressly proscribed.


1534
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:08.345
Whatever the motive for his return,
there can only be one punishment.


1535
01:53:09.220 --> 01:53:14.272
A punishment he shall share
with all of you here before me today.


1536
01:53:22.067 --> 01:53:24.911
By the power vested in
me by this court,


1537
01:53:25.570 --> 01:53:27.664
I sentence you all to
death by hanging.


1538
01:53:31.701 --> 01:53:35.002
May the Lord have
mercy on your souls.


1539
01:53:49.387 --> 01:53:51.015
Are you in much pain today?

1540
01:53:52.557 --> 01:53:55.401
I don't complain, dear boy.

1541
01:53:57.771 --> 01:54:00.024
If only you had stayed away...

1542
01:54:01.316 --> 01:54:03.318
And not seen this face?

1543
01:54:04.611 --> 01:54:08.411
I... I wish I had been
more deserving of your love.


1544
01:54:10.450 --> 01:54:11.702
Hush.

1545
01:54:13.453 --> 01:54:14.875
A gentleman.

1546
01:54:18.125 --> 01:54:19.502
My very own.

1547
01:54:23.172 --> 01:54:25.595
Magwitch, I must tell you.

1548
01:54:26.801 --> 01:54:29.304
Your daughter...
Whom you loved and lost...


1549
01:54:30.763 --> 01:54:32.140
She lived.

1550
01:54:32.599 --> 01:54:35.227
She lived, and found
powerful friends.


1551
01:54:36.478 --> 01:54:41.405
She is living now.
She is a lady and very beautiful.


1552
01:54:44.111 --> 01:54:46.705
And I... I love her.

1553
01:55:18.230 --> 01:55:19.698
I don't know you.

1554
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:21.617
Concerns a debt, sir.

1555
01:55:21.692 --> 01:55:26.046
125 pounds 15 and 6.

1556
01:55:26.697 --> 01:55:29.200
- I don't have it.
- We didn't think so, sir.


1557
01:55:30.034 --> 01:55:32.036
So we've come to arrest you.

1558
01:55:33.037 --> 01:55:34.710
Would you come with us, please, sir?

1559
01:55:36.499 --> 01:55:37.796
Yes.

1560
01:55:38.083 --> 01:55:39.630
Yes, of course.

1561
01:55:59.816 --> 01:56:02.319
- Hello there.
- Is it Joe?


1562
01:56:02.902 --> 01:56:04.745
Which it is, old chap.

1563
01:56:06.239 --> 01:56:07.741
Forgive me, Joe.

1564
01:56:07.865 --> 01:56:09.708
Dear old Pip, old chap,

1565
01:56:10.576 --> 01:56:12.704
you and me was ever friends.

1566
01:56:13.746 --> 01:56:15.840
Now, you sleep...

1567
01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:20.424
And when you're well enough,
what larks!


1568
01:56:45.113 --> 01:56:46.615
"Paid in full."

1569
01:56:47.866 --> 01:56:49.413
"Paid in full."

1570
01:56:55.415 --> 01:56:56.667
"Paid."

1571
01:57:36.499 --> 01:57:38.752
I came as quickly as I could.
I wanted to tell you...


1572
01:57:38.835 --> 01:57:40.178
on, Pip.

1573
01:57:40.378 --> 01:57:41.800
It's my wedding day!

1574
01:57:43.006 --> 01:57:45.850
Biddy, I can't for
the life of me get...


1575
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:48.602
Pip.

1576
01:57:50.055 --> 01:57:51.807
Oh, Pip!

1577
01:57:52.223 --> 01:57:54.191
- Oh!
- Biddy!


1578
01:57:54.768 --> 01:57:55.815
Oh!

1579
01:57:56.353 --> 01:57:57.855
Right, this way! Come on!

1580
01:57:58.229 --> 01:57:59.572
Forward, troops!

1581
01:57:59.731 --> 01:58:02.360
Come on! Or I'll carry
you like a big bird


1582
01:58:02.526 --> 01:58:04.528
and fly like a bird all
the way over there.


1583
01:58:06.697 --> 01:58:09.416
Come on, Mrs Gargery.

1584
01:58:09.617 --> 01:58:11.915
Oh! Oh, my poor old back!

1585
01:58:12.203 --> 01:58:14.456
What have you been eating?

1586
01:58:15.289 --> 01:58:16.632
Pip! Whoo!

1587
01:58:16.833 --> 01:58:19.302
<i>- Your life savings, Joe!
- It's only money, Pip.</i>


1588
01:58:19.962 --> 01:58:21.805
Nevertheless, I will work.

1589
01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:24.224
<i>I will pay you back every penny,
if it takes me...</i>


1590
01:58:24.299 --> 01:58:26.301
Pip. That's enough.

1591
01:59:09.805 --> 01:59:11.682
- Father! Father!
- Charles, be quiet.


1592
01:59:11.765 --> 01:59:14.860
How many times do I need to tell you, this
is a place of business, not a nursery!


1593
01:59:15.185 --> 01:59:17.779
I have a letter. 
Given by a lady.

1594
01:59:18.230 --> 01:59:19.607
Oh, a lady.

1595
01:59:20.941 --> 01:59:22.488
How intriguing!

1596
01:59:24.571 --> 01:59:26.494
Handel! You've a letter.

1597
02:00:14.664 --> 02:00:16.632
Drummle died 2 years ago.

1598
02:00:17.834 --> 02:00:20.758
He was kicking his horse,
and the horse kicked back.


1599
02:00:21.588 --> 02:00:23.056
I'm sorry to hear that.

1600
02:00:24.508 --> 02:00:25.725
Pip...

1601
02:00:26.676 --> 02:00:28.770
I'm sorry for anything
that brings you sorrow.


1602
02:00:29.179 --> 02:00:30.772
Well, rest assured I feel none.

1603
02:00:31.598 --> 02:00:35.444
My husband and I made each other
perfectly miserable, just as intended.


1604
02:00:39.941 --> 02:00:42.194
I have been bent and broken...

1605
02:00:43.736 --> 02:00:45.488
But I hope into a better shape.

1606
02:00:52.329 --> 02:00:54.047
I've been travelling a great deal.

1607
02:00:58.585 --> 02:01:00.963
I had heard that you were here,
and thriving...


1608
02:01:01.171 --> 02:01:03.890
And I had a desire to
see my old friend.


1609
02:01:06.635 --> 02:01:08.182
My only friend.

1610
02:01:11.348 --> 02:01:12.565
When we last met,

1611
02:01:13.725 --> 02:01:15.352
you said that you would
always think of me.


1612
02:01:17.354 --> 02:01:18.731
And I have.

1613
02:01:19.148 --> 02:01:21.947
- That you would think of the good in me.
- Always.


1614
02:01:26.656 --> 02:01:28.159
You are a part of me, Estella.

1615
02:01:29.118 --> 02:01:32.964
"You are in the ships", you said,
"And the river."


1616
02:01:37.710 --> 02:01:39.462
I love you, Estella.

1617
02:01:48.137 --> 02:01:49.434
I'm glad.
