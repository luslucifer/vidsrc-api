00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.150
The Origin of Evil

2
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.400
Go ahead.

3
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.900
Hello, madame.

4
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.810
Things OK?

5
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.860
Yeah, fine.

6
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.560
Sorry, she won't come.

7
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.940
No, you're kidding!

8
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.610
Shit, what's wrong now?

9
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.440
What can I say?

10
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.560
Fuck, she's a pain!

11
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:13.810
It's me!

12
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.230
Why are you in the dark?

13
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.310
You can't see a thing.
Turn on the light.


14
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.560
I didn't notice.

15
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.980
Home already?
What about the prison?


16
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.810
Don't ask,
I'll just get upset.


17
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.060
<i>Hello?</i>

18
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.270
<i>Hello?</i>

19
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.520
Good girl.

20
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.980
I have to tell you.

21
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.900
Yeah?

22
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.480
Virginie was fired.

23
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.440
Damn, for real?

24
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.900
They're closing.

25
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.480
Why are they closing?

26
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.690
They're always crowded at lunch.

27
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.150
She wants to come back.

28
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.860
And move back into her room.

29
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.900
But you can't stand her.

30
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.690
She is my daughter.

31
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.270
She has no one else.

32
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.230
<i>Hello?</i>

33
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.810
<i>Hello?</i>

34
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.270
Yes.

35
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.360
<i>Speak up!</i>

36
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.860
Yes, hello.

37
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.110
Hello, madame.

38
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.900
Sorry to disturb, 
I wanted to talk to Serge.

39
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.610
Serge Dumontet.

40
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.190
<i>Who's speaking?</i>

41
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.520
It's Stéphane.

42
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.150
I don't know if I have the right number.
<i>- Serge!</i>


43
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.860
<i>For you!</i>

44
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:23.060
<i>Who is it?</i>

45
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.770
<i>I think it's your daughter.</i>

46
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.730
<i>Hello?</i>

47
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.310
<i>Hello?</i>

48
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.110
<i>I don't hear you.</i>

49
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.440
Yes. Hello, Serge.

50
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.360
Sorry, this is...

51
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.560
This is Stéphane.

52
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.150
Are you Serge?

53
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.020
Yes.

54
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.520
So you're Stéphane?

55
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.020
Yes.

56
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.150
Sorry, but I'm so happy to meet you.

57
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.860
Sorry.

58
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.270
Are you OK?

59
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:55.560
Yeah, I'm fine.

60
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.940
Have you been
to Porquerolles before?


61
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.690
No, this is my first time.

62
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:06.400
Come.

63
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.400
The most beautiful spot on earth.

64
00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.190
Do you like it?
- It's magnificent.


65
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.110
This was one of my first restaurants.

66
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.810
This is yours?
- Absolutely.


67
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.270
It used to be just a café.

68
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.190
And now in season we
serve 300 meals a day.

69
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.860
This feels so strange.

70
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.190
What?

71
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:37.730
How you look at me.

72
00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.400
I'm overwhelmed.

73
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.190
I've dreamed of you so often.

74
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.060
Are you disappointed?

75
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.360
No.

76
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.400
No, no, not at all.

77
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:51.980
You're very handsome.

78
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.020
Tell me, how did you do it?

79
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.480
How did you find me?

80
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.810
Christiane Pierrat.

81
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.520
She said you lived here.

82
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.230
Christiane? Don't know her.
- She was a friend of Mom's.


83
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:11.770
She said that

84
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.650
you went on holiday together once.

85
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.650
And two years ago she saw you
in a shoe store.


86
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.610
She was trying on red boots.

87
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.310
No idea.

88
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.520
She came to Mom's funeral.
That's when she told me.


89
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.310
Léonore died?

90
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:29.560
Yes.

91
00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.060
Last February.

92
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.400
I'm sorry. I thought that...

93
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:39.770
That you knew.

94
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.520
What happened?

95
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.400
She had lung cancer.

96
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.810
It was very quick.

97
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:49.400
Three months.

98
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:18.520
<i>Yes?</i>
- Louise, it's Agnès.

99
00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.020
<i>I know. Where are you?
Is he still with her?</i>


100
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.230
Louise, we're on speaker.
- <i>OK.</i>


101
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:28.190
Hold on...
We're on the way and...


102
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.770
Stéphane's coming for lunch.

103
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.190
It wasn't planned, no. I told them.

104
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.520
I'll improvise.

105
00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:36.940
Goodbye.

106
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:41.150
You OK?

107
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:42.480
Yeah.

108
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.940
I'll take your coat.

109
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:59.730
Oh yeah. Thanks.

110
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:00.980
I'll be back.

111
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.190
Shall I prepare lunch?
- Yes, do.


112
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:06.980
Can I help?

113
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.440
No. Absolutely not.

114
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.900
Wait in the living room.

115
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.440
Alright.

116
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.110
Hello, Stéphane.

117
00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.190
Hello.

118
00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.020
Agnès? Serve us a drink.

119
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.810
Don't just stand there.

120
00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.270
Sit next to me.

121
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.980
Alright.

122
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.940
Celadon green and leopard...

123
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.730
A better match.

124
00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.560
So tell me,

125
00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.980
are you happy to have found Serge?

126
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:02.860
Yes.

127
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.900
You've wanted this for a long time, right?

128
00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.400
Yes, that's true.

129
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.020
It's quite...

130
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.860
moving, for me.

131
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.520
Not much resemblance.

132
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.310
No, try as I might...

133
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.270
You must take after your mother.

134
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.730
No? Do you look like her?

135
00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:23.810
Yes.

136
00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:24.860
Definitely.

137
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.440
A lot, even.

138
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.900
Serge was popular with women.

139
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.980
Some less attractive than others.

140
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.360
Serge?

141
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.940
Where are you?

142
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.560
He springs you on us
and disappears.


143
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.270
He's got some nerve!

144
00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.690
Agnès?

145
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.020
Agnès!

146
00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.360
What are you doing?
Stéphane's thirsty!


147
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.060
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

148
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.150
I have to say, your house is...

149
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:09.480
really beautiful.

150
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.610
And you, too, are...

151
00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:12.900
Don't overdo it.

152
00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.110
I've nothing against you.
I feel for you.


153
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.310
It's all my husband's fault.

154
00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.520
At any rate,

155
00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.690
I don't blame him.

156
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.520
Anyone can make mistakes.

157
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.060
It's part of life.
It's how we...


158
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.110
Where's George?

159
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.770
I don't know.

160
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.190
At the new hotel?

161
00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:38.940
There you are!

162
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.860
Have a seat, next to Stéphane!

163
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.480
Go on, sit down.

164
00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:57.770
Stéphane, may I introduce

165
00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.650
Jeanne, George's daughter.

166
00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.440
She attends boarding school
and spends weekends here.


167
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.110
Hello, Jeanne.
- Hello.


168
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.310
Jeanne, take a picture of us.

169
00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.810
Go on!
- It's not...


170
00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.060
I insist!

171
00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.400
Take lots,

172
00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.650
so Stéphane can choose the best.

173
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.520
George is coming.
- Good.


174
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.270
Where are you going?

175
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:29.650
Getting dressed.

176
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:39.810
You may have already told my father,
but what do you do?


177
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.230
Well, actually, 
I work in a fish plant.

178
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.270
Well, I mean,

179
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.190
we package trays of anchovies,

180
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.230
fish soup, terrines...

181
00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.150
Did you start the company?

182
00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.190
In fact...

183
00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:00.650
Yes.

184
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.360
I mean, it's quite recent.

185
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.020
Only two years.

186
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:08.560
No trivial feat.

187
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.060
Where did you get the idea?

188
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:17.150
One doesn't wake up thinking,
I'm going to make a fortune packing fish.


189
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.480
No, one doesn't make a fortune.

190
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.900
Not yet, at least.

191
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.900
It was by chance.
A friend of mine, Leila,


192
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.190
was working
in a factory that went bankrupt.


193
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.810
So we thought,

194
00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.980
why not take it over?

195
00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:34.440
And...

196
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.060
we got the bank loan immediately.

197
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.230
That was it.

198
00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:39.480
Great!

199
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.650
I started my first business

200
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.150
at 21.

201
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.860
How many employees?

202
00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.150
With the deliverymen, about 40.

203
00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.060
We're starting out small, but...

204
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.980
we're happy.

205
00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.560
It's going well.

206
00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.110
Especially in the current climate.

207
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.940
Yeah.

208
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.480
And you, George?

209
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.520
I manage my father's businesses.

210
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.860
Who's also Stéphane's father.

211
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.230
Did I say otherwise?
- No.


212
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.900
But you've referred twice to Serge
as "father."


213
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.110
If you say so.

214
00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.940
Anyway, I'd opened a business in Sydney,

215
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.690
where Jeanne and her dad were living.

216
00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.360
Well, at first.

217
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:30.810
When Serge had his stroke,
Mom asked me to come back and help.


218
00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:36.150
And George took advantage of my illness
to try to replace me.


219
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.110
She didn't take advantage!

220
00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.230
You were completely helpless!

221
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.610
Look at him!

222
00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.690
He can't even cut his meat.

223
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:48.650
And your deficits?

224
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:50.940
Profits are up 12% now.

225
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.150
Let's not start this again!

226
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:54.770
We won't go there.

227
00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.900
Stéphane has found her father.

228
00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.400
Your squabbles are of no interest.

229
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.270
Serge, can I help you?

230
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.480
No, I'm fine.

231
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:10.400
I'm not hungry.

232
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.810
I'll rest a bit.

233
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.150
Toulon Municipal Prison

234
00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.230
Please, not now.

235
00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:08.310
Can I do anything?

236
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.150
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

237
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.560
Have you worked here long?

238
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.610
Since 1998.

239
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:17.770
Really?

240
00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.150
You must know them well.

241
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.110
It was hard on Louise when George left.

242
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:28.310
Alone here, with Serge.

243
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.020
I stood by her.

244
00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:32.770
We've been very close.

245
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.730
With Serge, too?

246
00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.940
Leave it! That's my job.

247
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.150
I just want to help.

248
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:47.360
No, really!

249
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.440
Don't move.

250
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.190
Your nose is bleeding.

251
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.150
Are you OK?
Do you want some cold water?


252
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.230
Dammit.

253
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.860
You told me you bought the restaurant...

254
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.480
But what did you do before that?

255
00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.190
I still work now.
I have no intention of stopping.


256
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.520
I started out buying small bars,

257
00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.980
then night clubs.

258
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.980
And then I opened hotels on the seaside,

259
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.020
golf courses...
- Really?


260
00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.190
I was the mayor of Hyères.

261
00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:44.230
Twice reelected.

262
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.060
It's true. People liked me.

263
00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.810
Is that red cottage yours too?

264
00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.810
We let Agnès stay there.

265
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.400
And we use it to store Louise's things...

266
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:58.270
Such as?

267
00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.230
You must have noticed that

268
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.560
the house is somewhat...

269
00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:03.650
crammed.

270
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.150
Yes.

271
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:08.230
Louise has always been a collector.

272
00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:12.020
But now she buys everything.
It's an obsession.


273
00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.810
The doctors call it syllogomania.

274
00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:20.900
I've kept tabs.
On average she spends 1500 euros a day.


275
00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.230
Everyone says it's...

276
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.110
psychological!

277
00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.150
But I know she does
it to piss me off.

278
00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:32.190
You know,

279
00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:35.900
since my stroke, it's complicated here.

280
00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.520
I can't do anything.

281
00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.860
I know, I wasn't always perfect,

282
00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.110
but I don't deserve this.

283
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:47.860
Right?

284
00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.520
We all make mistakes.
- Sure.


285
00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.610
Still, I have no regrets.

286
00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:56.690
You know,

287
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.190
I...

288
00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:00.480
loved your mother a lot.

289
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.900
The other women, too,
each in their own way.


290
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.730
Did you have lots of women?

291
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.150
A few.

292
00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.690
I was wondering...
- Shh!


293
00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.400
Wait.

294
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:16.860
Enjoy the view.

295
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:36.650
I was wondering...

296
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.360
George and I have men's names.
It's strange, isn't it?


297
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.020
Why? It's not strange.

298
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.150
I wanted sons.

299
00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:48.860
Your Mom insisted on Stéphane.
- Really?


300
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:50.650
She said you did.

301
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.110
Well, she lied.

302
00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.150
Stéphane?
Come, we'll take you back.


303
00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:00.770
No, my ferry's at 5:47.
I still have time, don't I?


304
00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.520
You'll take our boat.

305
00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.860
We're already at the stairs.

306
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:11.270
He's coming.

307
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.560
Did Serge tell you about me?

308
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:26.940
I imagine it wasn't easy for you,
if I put myself in your shoes.


309
00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.230
But please don't come back.

310
00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.020
Go ahead.

311
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.110
Bye.

312
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.980
Hi.

313
00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:00.110
So today you're talking to me?

314
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.940
It takes me 45 minutes to come here.

315
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.980
So if you're going to sulk,
I'll stay home.


316
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.560
Wait.

317
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:15.610
I'm sorry.

318
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:19.770
I get all paranoid.

319
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.190
I imagine things.

320
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.610
It oppresses me.

321
00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:25.440
Yes.

322
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:28.980
You're oppressed.
- You're a pain!


323
00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.980
I miss you so much!

324
00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.400
I miss you too.

325
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:49.230
What do you think?
- I don't think anything.


326
00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:51.480
I visit as often as I can.

327
00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:53.360
Stop.

328
00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:55.900
You're so beautiful.

329
00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.400
OK.

330
00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.230
So how'd your first day at work go?

331
00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.230
It was fine.

332
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:08.690
Not inspiring, but OK.

333
00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:11.650
It's good to get out.

334
00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.440
Great.

335
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.150
If you watch your step and work well,

336
00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:20.860
we'll get you out on parole.

337
00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.730
And we can be together always.

338
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:25.020
Always.

339
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.560
And you?

340
00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:27.770
Tell me things.

341
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:32.230
Me? There's not much to tell.

342
00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.860
And Saturday?

343
00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.810
I called, but no answer.

344
00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.060
Honestly, I can't remember.

345
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.940
When?

346
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.560
2:30.

347
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.310
So precise.

348
00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.400
You hung up after three rings.

349
00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:50.610
Really?
- Who were you with?


350
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:53.060
Honestly, I don't remember.
- I'll bet.


351
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.980
Don't go there.

352
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:59.310
Please, stop it.
- Anyway, I can't check.


353
00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:03.440
Stop.

354
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.900
Why'd you come up?
- Virginie's here.


355
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.810
Really, now?

356
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.020
You have to leave. I'm sorry.

357
00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:19.940
Fuck!

358
00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:10.400
Hi, Leila.

359
00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.310
It's you! You scared me!

360
00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:14.940
What's going on?

361
00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:16.810
You see,

362
00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.110
it's my landlady. 
She threw me out.

363
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.520
Her daughter moved back,
so I don't have a room.


364
00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.810
You're not serious?

365
00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.360
Shit, I'm really screwed.

366
00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.520
Can I stay with you tonight?

367
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:37.480
Yeah, come in.

368
00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.110
Thank you.

369
00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:42.650
Thank you.

370
00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.110
You have mail.

371
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.480
Let's see.

372
00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.610
Little hearts!

373
00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:06.690
It's a letter from Stéphane.

374
00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.230
George will love this.

375
00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:14.020
You don't have to tell her.

376
00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.310
You didn't have to bring her here!

377
00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:23.310
If George is unhappy, she can leave.

378
00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.650
I can't stand her being here.

379
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.560
Just her breathing is unbearable.

380
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:32.440
If you don't want her to breathe,

381
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:36.770
it means you wish she were dead.

382
00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:41.900
Stop buttering your toast!

383
00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:50.480
Hello? Yes,

384
00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.110
it's Mrs Louise Dumontet.

385
00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:53.190
Yes.

386
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:55.110
I'd like to order

387
00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:57.190
the butcher knife.

388
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.560
It looks wonderful. Right.

389
00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.230
Yes, I saw that. German steel.

390
00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:07.480
For steel, Germans can't be beat,
don't you agree?


391
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:09.310
Yes.

392
00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.110
They're simply the best.

393
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:12.310
Yes, certainly.

394
00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.400
In the Ruhr and everywhere.

395
00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.560
In fact, send me several, because I think...

396
00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.480
Serge?

397
00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:44.810
I'm happy you called.

398
00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.560
I was thinking of you.

399
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.480
Yes, and you?

400
00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.400
Sorry about the noise. 
I'm at the plant.

401
00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:53.900
Come on!

402
00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.560
Hang up. Your station!

403
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:57.060
And... Yeah.

404
00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:58.610
Exactly.

405
00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.310
Élodie, stop your machine.

406
00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.440
Right now?

407
00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:04.860
Terrific! Of course!

408
00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.730
What's going on?

409
00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:07.770
Call you back.

410
00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:10.190
Unbelievable! Using your phone!

411
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:12.110
My dad had a stroke.

412
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.900
He's in hospital.

413
00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:16.110
You can't leave your station.

414
00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:20.360
Did you hear what I just said?
He's in the hospital, he may die!


415
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:22.150
Fuck!

416
00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:23.810
Shit!

417
00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:27.610
Why are you looking at me?

418
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:29.360
Her dad's in hospital.

419
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.610
She can't leave!

420
00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:32.310
Can't leave?
It's her dad!


421
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:52.150
Sorry!

422
00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.560
I'll leave these.

423
00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:12.230
Thanks, but I brought one.

424
00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.110
All the same...

425
00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:17.190
Can I see Serge?

426
00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:18.560
Of course.

427
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:21.360
Where is he?
- In his office.


428
00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.940
When you stare at me,
what are you thinking?


429
00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:35.270
Nothing.

430
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.810
I'm allowed to look at you.

431
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.230
Yes.

432
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:46.400
It's nice, like a minister's office.

433
00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.310
Anyway, it's full of memories.

434
00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.150
Who's that in the pictures?

435
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:54.730
Frédéric.

436
00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.520
My son.

437
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.020
You didn't tell me.

438
00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.560
I have a brother?

439
00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:05.690
Where is he?

440
00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:07.270
He's dead.

441
00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.360
Forgive me.

442
00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.690
I'm very sorry.

443
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:18.360
What happened?
- He's dead. I don't want to talk about it.


444
00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:23.770
I see.

445
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:25.900
He was handsome, too.

446
00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:46.060
You're cold.

447
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:48.020
Sorry.

448
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.730
He was supposed to succeed me.

449
00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:58.650
George wants to revolutionize everything
with her American methods.


450
00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:04.020
She has the board literally
eating out of her hand.


451
00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.940
She's not made for management.

452
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:10.980
I know what this business needs.

453
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.650
The human touch.

454
00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:13.480
Yes.

455
00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.270
Your workers, too...

456
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:19.940
They must always be whining, right?
The unions and all?


457
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:21.980
Absolutely. There are...

458
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:24.110
tensions.

459
00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.610
But I agree with you.

460
00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:28.480
The human touch is crucial.

461
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.360
You know,
all my life work was my priority.


462
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:38.310
Everything to ensure my family
would be well provided for.


463
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.900
And I had this villa built,

464
00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:44.150
which is beautiful, isn't it?

465
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:45.230
Definitely.

466
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:46.480
Then there's...

467
00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:48.310
all the expenses.

468
00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:51.310
Sure, it's enormous.

469
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.810
No, I mean Louise.

470
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:56.480
Right.

471
00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.480
I'm going to need your help.

472
00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:02.270
To do what?

473
00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:06.360
I'll tell you later.

474
00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:09.940
Agnès always lurks behind the doors.

475
00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:32.060
Come with me.

476
00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.650
It smells of paint. 
Air the place out.

477
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:17.860
Hello.
- Hello.


478
00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:23.360
The chairs are arriving tomorrow?
- Yes.


479
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.650
What is it, Agnès?
I'm at the new place.


480
00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:39.980
When did she arrive?

481
00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:11.560
These are gifts from clients of our hotels.

482
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.810
These were given to me by Tiberi.

483
00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.060
These are from my good friend Pasqua.

484
00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.650
Is the fish smell you?

485
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:33.650
Yes, I'm so sorry.

486
00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:35.730
Anyway,

487
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.690
what do you prefer, red or white?
You choose.


488
00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:44.060
I've a slight preference for white, but...

489
00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:46.400
Red will go better with dinner.

490
00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:51.110
Château Lafite
-Rothschild 2003.

491
00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.480
It looks good.

492
00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.360
Good?

493
00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:57.730
Know how much a bottle costs?

494
00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.650
1200 euros.

495
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:01.560
Really?

496
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:05.020
Serge?

497
00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:07.310
Are you OK?
- Yes.


498
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:55.690
I searched her room, her purse...
Nothing.


499
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:58.520
No ID, not even a wallet.
- And her jacket?


500
00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.730
Nothing.
- What is it now?


501
00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:02.940
Are we sure she's Stéphane?

502
00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:05.610
Why?

503
00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:07.440
What if she isn't?

504
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:10.270
Don't talk nonsense.

505
00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.400
Yes.

506
00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.730
Yes, hello.

507
00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:16.310
I've been expecting the delivery...

508
00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.980
I've been expecting a Taurus treadmill.

509
00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:20.480
I really need it.

510
00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.020
It hasn't arrived.

511
00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:23.520
Gran, you're a riot!

512
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:27.110
No.

513
00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:31.980
I don't understand. I'm a VIP customer.
It's unacceptable.


514
00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:33.480
The order number is

515
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:34.560
1

516
00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:38.610
QR1234T9

517
00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.940
capital B... Yes.

518
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:44.560
The price is 2,499 euros.

519
00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.150
Stop it! Are you crazy?

520
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:48.690
You're hurting me!

521
00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:50.400
Stop spending my money!

522
00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:53.360
Serge, give me the telephone!

523
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:59.020
You old fool!

524
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:05.480
You do nothing.

525
00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.440
Anything that pisses you off...

526
00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:14.610
What is it?

527
00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:18.520
A Château Lafite
-Rothschild,

528
00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.730
2003.

529
00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:23.060
Stéphane chose it.

530
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:25.360
No, Serge did.

531
00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.060
I'm not a wine expert.

532
00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.110
But you chose the most expensive bottle.

533
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:46.060
I ran into Mrs Lenormand.

534
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.730
Going to the police.
Her bank account was hacked.


535
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:52.560
They'd spent 17,000 on the Internet.

536
00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.900
What did they buy?

537
00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:57.310
Mom, who cares?

538
00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:59.440
Well, I'd like to know.

539
00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.360
How'd they do it?

540
00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:04.360
These days it's easy
to impersonate someone.


541
00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:09.560
Like, Stéphane?

542
00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.310
Why, Stéphane?

543
00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.270
No reason.

544
00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:17.020
George thinks that Stéphane
isn't your daughter.


545
00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:20.690
Or that she claims to be her

546
00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:22.480
for your inheritance.

547
00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.400
Thanks, Mom.
- You're awful!


548
00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:28.060
If we want to get along,
we have to speak openly.


549
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:31.310
Stéphane, don't you agree?

550
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:33.980
Yes. Totally.

551
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:35.730
All I said was that

552
00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:38.020
we hadn't asked Stéphane for ID.

553
00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:39.860
Stop it right there.

554
00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.520
You should've asked her!

555
00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:58.770
Serge!

556
00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.400
Serge!

557
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:01.560
C'mon!

558
00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:03.270
Help me!

559
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:05.020
Wait...

560
00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:15.440
Are you OK?
- Of course.


561
00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:17.690
There, he's better.

562
00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.650
He always gets better.

563
00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:46.400
We won't risk our health
with the Château Lafite.


564
00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.940
Stéphane, if you show us some ID,
we can move on.


565
00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.360
Holy shit!

566
00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:11.060
Those bitches!

567
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:20.310
Why don't you have any ID?

568
00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:25.560
My purse was stolen.

569
00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:26.940
That's why.

570
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:32.360
May I get by?

571
00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:34.690
Thank you!

572
00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:38.980
George, apologize!

573
00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:42.980
You can't just show
up and ask for money.

574
00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:46.940
I didn't ask for money.
Or anything else, dammit!


575
00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:51.110
All my life I've longed to know
who my father is.


576
00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.940
That's all I want.

577
00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.360
It's my fault.

578
00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.520
I shouldn't have brought it up.

579
00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:00.400
Stéphane, don't go!

580
00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.310
Stéphane, please!

581
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.690
Don't go now!

582
00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.730
It's too late!

583
00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:11.980
For the ferry.

584
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.770
You took her to your office?
- We're not allowed in.


585
00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:24.060
Stop, you're breaking my heart.

586
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:27.060
We can rip it out, too.

587
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:30.110
Stop, you don't understand.

588
00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:33.310
If Stéphane returned after all this time,

589
00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.860
perhaps Frédéric

590
00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:37.810
will come back, too!

591
00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:40.650
Stop it, you're sick!

592
00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:42.480
Gran, are you OK?

593
00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:43.770
Get out of here!

594
00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:45.900
All of you!

595
00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.900
This is my house!

596
00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:49.690
Do that again,
you're dead.


597
00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.310
It seems...

598
00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.360
There's no ferry. 
It's too late.

599
00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:02.480
That's what I tried to tell you.

600
00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:07.230
Could you take me in your boat?

601
00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.940
No, it's too late.

602
00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.770
You'll stay here, we'll have dinner,

603
00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:14.520
all of us.

604
00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.400
Right?

605
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.480
Alright.

606
00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.400
Come, Stéphane.

607
00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:55.230
What are you drawing?

608
00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:05.900
I knew it! You're obsessed!

609
00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:10.230
Why?
- Aren't you tired of drawing her?


610
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:11.520
No, I'm not.

611
00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:13.480
I enjoy it.

612
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:15.270
Understand?

613
00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:19.650
Well, you nailed the eyes.

614
00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.940
And you draw her from memory?

615
00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:23.810
Thanks.

616
00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:28.270
Stop it!

617
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:30.900
What about drawing me?

618
00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:32.610
Just once?

619
00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:42.810
You're in my bubble.
- I know.


620
00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:44.190
Fuck off!

621
00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:14.940
Jesus!

622
00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:16.940
You scared me!

623
00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.440
Are you OK?

624
00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:21.060
What's wrong?

625
00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:22.810
I need your help.

626
00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:26.060
They're suing
to be my guardians.


627
00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:27.810
What?

628
00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.770
They can't!

629
00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:31.560
They'll hear.

630
00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.360
Look,

631
00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.730
as soon as George is named trustee

632
00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:37.810
in charge of the estate,

633
00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.020
I'll be helpless.

634
00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:42.940
If she gets away with it,

635
00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.730
I'm dead.

636
00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.230
So...

637
00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:52.360
I go to court in three weeks

638
00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:54.610
for the final hearing.

639
00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:58.230
I want you to testify on my behalf.

640
00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:02.020
I want you to say
that I'm sound of mind,

641
00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:05.480
that this is all a scheme of theirs.

642
00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:07.810
I don't know, Serge.

643
00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:16.110
I think you should ask someone
who knows about such things.


644
00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:17.770
A lawyer?

645
00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:21.230
My lawyer's not worried.
My latest medical tests show


646
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:23.770
I still have all my mental faculties.

647
00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:25.360
It's just...

648
00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:29.810
the last time I fainted, so those bitches
scored some points.


649
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.020
With you, I'll...

650
00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:35.360
I'll crush them.

651
00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:39.860
George will hate me.

652
00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:43.270
And?

653
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:45.230
What of it?

654
00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:47.360
She already does.

655
00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.360
Are you OK?

656
00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:00.020
Serge?

657
00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:05.110
What's wrong?

658
00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:06.770
It's my legs.

659
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.440
Do they hurt?

660
00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:11.690
Yes.

661
00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:13.900
But it's alright.

662
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:15.900
Sit down.

663
00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:18.980
Easy now.

664
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:29.060
Here.

665
00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:31.560
I'll massage them.

666
00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:33.690
I'm good at it.

667
00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:38.230
I do it after
my day at the plant.

668
00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:42.650
I'm on my feet non-stop, I don't know
how many kilometers I walk.


669
00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:45.480
It really helps.

670
00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:51.770
Hello.

671
00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:53.480
Hello.

672
00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:56.560
How are you?

673
00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:58.440
I'll feed the dogs.
- OK.


674
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:03.560
George...

675
00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:05.520
The next time I come,

676
00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:08.270
I promise, I'll bring ID.

677
00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:10.900
There won't be a next time,
I told you.


678
00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:13.360
Serge asked me to come.

679
00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:15.150
I don't want...

680
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:16.060
Mom!

681
00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:18.230
I'm off. Want a lift?

682
00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:21.400
Mom?

683
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:26.150
Why are you so mad at him?

684
00:54:27.610 --> 00:54:30.520
He sacrificed a lot to provide for you,

685
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:33.110
to build this house.

686
00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:35.060
He has you brainwashed.

687
00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:36.860
Not really.

688
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:38.900
You're a sweet daddy's girl.

689
00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:42.440
Mom!

690
00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:43.900
I'm leaving.

691
00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:45.610
Stop shouting. Here I am.

692
00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:50.560
Good morning, Stéphane.
Did you sleep well?


693
00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:51.940
Yes, thank you.

694
00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.190
Good.

695
00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:56.730
Shall we give you a lift?

696
00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:00.360
I'll go by my own.

697
00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.770
<i>On</i>my own.

698
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:03.190
Sorry?

699
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:05.900
I'll go <i>on</i>my own,
not <i>by</i> my own.


700
00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.310
Right.

701
00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:08.980
Goodbye.

702
00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.230
Goodbye.

703
00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:12.770
Coming!

704
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:45.770
What are you doing?

705
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:47.150
You're here?

706
00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:49.270
I thought you'd left.

707
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:53.190
You need money?

708
00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.020
This is all Louise's.

709
00:55:58.940 --> 00:55:59.810
So?

710
00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:02.400
She doesn't know what she has.

711
00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:04.940
Still, that's no excuse.

712
00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:10.230
Come, we'll put all this back.

713
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:17.060
She's a sweet girl.

714
00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:18.520
I like her a lot.

715
00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.110
She's wholesome.

716
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:24.230
You'll see how wholesome she is
when he has her testify against us.


717
00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:28.270
Even if she gets a share,
you'll still have plenty.


718
00:56:28.310 --> 00:56:29.230
No!

719
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:32.860
I want him to lose!
I've kept his businesses alive.


720
00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:35.270
You, you! It's all about you!

721
00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:36.900
What about me?

722
00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.730
Who's going to look after me?

723
00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:47.360
After you all leave, what'll I do?

724
00:56:49.310 --> 00:56:51.690
At least, if I get along with her,

725
00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:54.480
I won't be alone.

726
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:13.110
Hold on.

727
00:58:13.770 --> 00:58:14.730
It's no good.

728
00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:17.900
No, wait. Wait.

729
00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:19.400
What's wrong?

730
00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:30.400
What is it?

731
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:32.400
Nothing. Nothing.

732
00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:36.650
If you're bored, you can go.

733
00:58:37.810 --> 00:58:39.650
No, it's not that.

734
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:46.060
I can see you're bored.
- I'm just tired.


735
00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:55.980
No, really. It's great.

736
00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:57.310
I swear.

737
00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:07.730
What about you, you haven't said...

738
00:59:07.770 --> 00:59:08.980
How's work?

739
00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:15.110
I fold leaflets all day
for 1.38 euros an hour, I'm great.


740
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.400
The sunshine's gone.

741
00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:20.940
Hang in there.

742
00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:22.060
Yeah, sure.

743
00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:25.230
I have two more years and you're out.

744
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:26.860
I can feel it.

745
00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:28.860
You're fed up.

746
00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:30.610
Stop, you're a pain.

747
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:33.730
I've visited for three years,
so if I was fed up....


748
00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:39.610
I know it'll make you angry...

749
00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:42.360
So don't say it.
- I'm going to.


750
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:46.400
I'm going to contact my father.

751
00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:56.270
Here we go again.

752
00:59:56.310 --> 00:59:57.650
I feel ready.

753
00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:00.230
And tell him what?

754
01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:05.230
That bastard who treated your mom like shit,

755
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:06.900
who never sent money,

756
01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:09.940
never looked after you,
never called or wrote.


757
01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:11.270
What do we know?

758
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:15.310
What if she lied?
She was no saint.


759
01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:17.150
Now it's your mom's fault.

760
01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.060
You've always said he was a bastard

761
01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:25.770
and now you're ready to kiss his ass.

762
01:00:25.810 --> 01:00:26.730
Stop it!

763
01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:28.730
Lay off!

764
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.980
Is there a problem?

765
01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.360
No problem.

766
01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.190
Then calm down.
- I'm calm.


767
01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:38.690
Nathalie, tell her I'm calm.

768
01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:41.980
We're good.

769
01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:44.860
OK.

770
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:53.190
All my life Mother repeated

771
01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:55.810
she'd dance on the scumbag's grave.

772
01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:58.020
It's awful to say that.

773
01:00:58.810 --> 01:01:01.020
I need to hear his side, right?

774
01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:04.690
You're leaving?

775
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:06.230
And your side?

776
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:09.440
"Hi, I'm your daughter.
I killed my girlfriend."


777
01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.860
I didn't kill her!

778
01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:15.150
You're awful!

779
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:16.980
Then don't be stupid!

780
01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:20.520
Finding him
won't make your life less shitty.


781
01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.560
Christ!

782
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:23.190
Fuck you!

783
01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:25.190
Want a cuff?

784
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:26.360
Stop it.

785
01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.480
Stop it!

786
01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:32.310
Cut it out!
- You're trying to provoke me.


787
01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.940
Stéphane, calm down!

788
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:35.610
It's over, enough!

789
01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:37.690
Enough!
- Nathalie!


790
01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.150
I feel good with you. 
It's so relaxed.

791
01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.560
I wanted to ask you...

792
01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:57.190
You know...

793
01:01:57.810 --> 01:02:00.270
That girl who was in your cell...

794
01:02:00.310 --> 01:02:01.730
What was her name?

795
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:03.440
Magalie?

796
01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:05.400
Are you in touch?

797
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:07.770
Yeah, sort of.

798
01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:09.560
When I run into her. Why?

799
01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.560
I need a new ID card.

800
01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:14.940
You do?

801
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:17.400
But not for me.

802
01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.440
For who?

803
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:24.690
There's a girl I know
who doesn't have her papers.


804
01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:26.980
I'd like to help her.

805
01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.650
Otherwise she's fucked.

806
01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:31.810
It's not for you?

807
01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:33.020
No, I told you.

808
01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:37.310
Are you up to your old tricks?

809
01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:42.650
Stop sucking that kiwi!
It's gross.


810
01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:55.440
You're not going to lecture me, are you?

811
01:02:56.110 --> 01:02:59.110
If I say it's not
for me, it's not for me.

812
01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:02.150
Do you believe me?

813
01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:58.020
Good.

814
01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.110
Sit next to me.

815
01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:37.900
Here?

816
01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:38.900
Where else?

817
01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:43.770
You don't ask Stéphane
if she'd like anything?


818
01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:46.230
Would you like anything?

819
01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:48.270
No, thank you.

820
01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:56.360
Last time I visited,

821
01:04:57.610 --> 01:05:00.110
I saw her steal Louise's things.

822
01:05:01.650 --> 01:05:02.610
Really?

823
01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:03.480
I did.

824
01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.310
Pairs of shoes that she
put in an Ikea bag.

825
01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:11.190
She did that with my wine, too.

826
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:13.440
No, really?

827
01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.980
That's why they're under lock and key.

828
01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.310
You know...

829
01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:22.560
She's like all Jews,
she can't stop herself.


830
01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:25.650
It's in their blood.

831
01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:51.020
So...

832
01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.610
I told my lawyer

833
01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:57.730
you'll be at the hearing.

834
01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.110
We'll win.

835
01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.650
For sure.

836
01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:12.190
Stéphane!

837
01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.690
Hello, Louise!

838
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:17.310
I didn't know you were coming.

839
01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:19.270
Here I am.

840
01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.860
Having work done?

841
01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:29.230
Yes, I had this crazy idea.

842
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:32.020
But Agnès can't help me.
She has vertigo.


843
01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:34.230
I don't.

844
01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.940
Then you can help me.

845
01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.310
Of course, with pleasure!

846
01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.230
Follow me!

847
01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:21.190
All these tapes!

848
01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:26.650
I have a lot, don't I?

849
01:07:26.690 --> 01:07:27.520
You do!

850
01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:29.940
But...

851
01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:31.110
What are they?

852
01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:35.020
When there were six TV channels,

853
01:07:35.770 --> 01:07:37.060
for six years

854
01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:39.980
I recorded all the programs, every one,

855
01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:42.020
24 hours a day.

856
01:07:43.650 --> 01:07:45.060
But... what for?

857
01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:48.900
You see, Serge always forbid me to work.

858
01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.190
I had to occupy myself.

859
01:07:53.310 --> 01:07:54.190
Oh yeah.

860
01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.360
I see.

861
01:07:56.110 --> 01:07:57.770
Why was he against it?

862
01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:05.270
Women who work weren't his cup of tea.

863
01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:11.110
Stretch it taut so they won't fall.

864
01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.440
There.
- Perfect.


865
01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:17.650
You have it?
- Yes, it's stretched tight.


866
01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.980
OK, I'll pull it.

867
01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:21.770
And...

868
01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:24.360
I wanted to know.

869
01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:27.110
How did you meet Serge?

870
01:08:27.150 --> 01:08:29.690
Our families.
Our parents were friends.


871
01:08:30.310 --> 01:08:33.900
You should've seen him.
He was handsome, with dark eyes.


872
01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:38.690
Your father was very erotic.

873
01:08:42.230 --> 01:08:44.190
After that, there was

874
01:08:44.230 --> 01:08:45.730
Delphine...

875
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:47.810
Solange...

876
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:50.730
your mother...

877
01:08:52.230 --> 01:08:53.650
and all the others.

878
01:08:55.650 --> 01:08:58.480
He started to fall into dark rages.

879
01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:02.770
He became violent.

880
01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:03.810
He did?

881
01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:06.770
With you, too?

882
01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:11.900
Why didn't you leave?

883
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:14.190
I don't know.

884
01:09:14.770 --> 01:09:15.980
I was weak

885
01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:17.360
or a coward or...

886
01:09:18.270 --> 01:09:20.310
Or something.
Or both at once.


887
01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:30.940
Without Agnès
I don't know what I would've done.


888
01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:35.480
The loss of my son

889
01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:38.770
was such a shock for us all.

890
01:09:39.730 --> 01:09:41.810
If Agnès hadn't been here,

891
01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:44.360
I can't imagine...

892
01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:53.060
So, they're solid now.

893
01:09:53.730 --> 01:09:54.730
For sure.

894
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:55.650
Good.

895
01:09:55.690 --> 01:09:58.270
Only you could've thought of this!

896
01:09:58.810 --> 01:10:02.480
It would be silly if I died
crushed by my collections.


897
01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:10.900
It's so soft.

898
01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:11.980
It's fox.

899
01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:12.770
Right.

900
01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.520
It's yours.

901
01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.060
No!
- I insist.


902
01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.110
No, I'm embarrassed.

903
01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:33.860
Has Serge shown you our secret passage?

904
01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:36.730
Secret passage?
- Yes.


905
01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:37.810
No.

906
01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:40.150
I'll take you.

907
01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:45.940
Here we go!

908
01:10:58.190 --> 01:10:59.810
It's incredible!

909
01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:07.150
I love coming here.
Everyone searches for me.


910
01:11:15.190 --> 01:11:16.230
I...

911
01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:18.520
I wanted to ask you a question.

912
01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.730
Yes, go ahead.

913
01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.730
How did Frédéric die?

914
01:11:24.230 --> 01:11:25.270
Frédéric?

915
01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:26.560
He's not dead!

916
01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.310
He's not?

917
01:11:28.730 --> 01:11:29.560
No!

918
01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.940
Sorry...
- No, he's...


919
01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.560
gone.

920
01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:36.020
One morning,

921
01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:39.400
he packed his things,
took his car and left.

922
01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:42.360
Sorry, I thought he'd died!

923
01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:44.110
Serge said that...

924
01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.730
You haven't heard from him since?
- No.


925
01:11:50.690 --> 01:11:52.110
It was his choice.

926
01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:56.230
I'm sure he'll come back one day.

927
01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:00.560
How can you leave your family like that?

928
01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:04.150
At least he had the courage.

929
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:09.560
Serge wanted his son to succeed him,
to be like him.


930
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:13.440
But Frédéric had other plans.

931
01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:19.940
Anyway, Serge never accepted
his homosexuality.


932
01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.400
He was very hard on him.

933
01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:27.480
And very violent.

934
01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:37.480
It's good you're back.

935
01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:05.400
Who're you waiting for? Nathalie?

936
01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:08.360
She won't come.

937
01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:14.980
Let's go.

938
01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:23.400
<i>Leave a message, thanks.</i>

939
01:13:24.230 --> 01:13:25.230
Hi, it's me.

940
01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.810
Hey, I was expecting you today.

941
01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:30.360
Why didn't you come?

942
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:32.650
I don't get it.

943
01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:36.310
Are you paying me back for last time?

944
01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.940
I'm sorry, y'know. I...

945
01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:41.770
I overreacted, but...

946
01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:44.770
I didn't get your reaction.

947
01:13:49.690 --> 01:13:53.060
We have a date in
court on Monday at 11.

948
01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:56.360
We have to prepare your deposition.

949
01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.770
There'll be my lawyer, Ms Ajello,
Louise and George's lawyer...


950
01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:05.360
a caricature of the hysterical feminist.

951
01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.110
So, you need to be convincing.

952
01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:12.940
I'm not sure.

953
01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:14.860
The judge won't believe me.

954
01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:17.940
I'm convinced
she'll listen to you attentively


955
01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:20.520
because we'll say the whole truth.

956
01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:21.520
Oh yeah?

957
01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:22.940
Which truth?

958
01:14:23.230 --> 01:14:25.230
There's only one truth. Sit.

959
01:14:31.150 --> 01:14:32.480
From childhood,

960
01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.860
you and I were always very close.

961
01:14:35.610 --> 01:14:38.730
I often came to
visit you at your mom's.

962
01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.400
Saturdays I'd take you to St
-Maxime.

963
01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.400
I'd buy you comic books,

964
01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.480
clothes...

965
01:14:46.230 --> 01:14:49.310
I gave your mother money.
I looked after you.


966
01:14:49.730 --> 01:14:51.560
If you want, you can say...

967
01:14:51.610 --> 01:14:52.980
If you like...

968
01:14:53.690 --> 01:14:55.400
that we get along well.

969
01:14:58.730 --> 01:15:02.060
You have the same rights
in my company as George.


970
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:04.310
What does your little factory pay?

971
01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:07.610
I can give you ten times as much.

972
01:15:07.650 --> 01:15:10.150
No, no. I don't want anything.

973
01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:12.020
I told you.

974
01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:20.980
Here.

975
01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:21.690
No!

976
01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:23.190
For a start.

977
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:26.150
Serge! I don't want it.

978
01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:28.400
Take it!

979
01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:29.980
No, I won't.

980
01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:32.980
Yes. Buy me a present,
that's always nice.


981
01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:34.440
I said no.

982
01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:36.110
You're pissing me off!

983
01:15:36.150 --> 01:15:38.480
Those two cunts
will steal all my money.


984
01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:40.310
That's your role.

985
01:15:40.730 --> 01:15:42.190
No, it isn't.

986
01:15:42.230 --> 01:15:43.560
I said...
- Take it!


987
01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:45.060
Fuck!
- Take it!


988
01:15:46.270 --> 01:15:47.230
Christ!

989
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:48.230
Take it!

990
01:15:52.690 --> 01:15:53.810
Pick it up.

991
01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:56.150
Pick it up!

992
01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:00.860
Pick it up!

993
01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:04.440
Go on!

994
01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:05.440
Pick it up!

995
01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:24.230
Shit!

996
01:16:25.190 --> 01:16:26.400
I can't talk.

997
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:28.610
<i>Where are you?</i>

998
01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:30.230
I'll explain tomorrow.

999
01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:31.730
<i>Who are you with?</i>

1000
01:16:31.770 --> 01:16:34.020
Stop it! I'm not with anyone!

1001
01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:35.900
More of your bullshit!

1002
01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:38.940
My landlady wants her room back.
I'm screwed.


1003
01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:41.150
<i>What?
She can't just kick you out!</i>


1004
01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:44.150
What's going on?

1005
01:16:44.190 --> 01:16:45.440
<i>What was that?</i>

1006
01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.520
<i>What was that?</i>

1007
01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:48.400
<i>Has she gone crazy?</i>

1008
01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.360
<i>Nathalie!</i>

1009
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:51.440
<i>Nathalie, fuck!</i>

1010
01:17:25.810 --> 01:17:26.940
Feeling better?

1011
01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.230
Thanks.

1012
01:17:32.650 --> 01:17:34.440
I'm sorry about the vase.

1013
01:17:34.730 --> 01:17:37.610
That's of no importance. 
I'll buy others.

1014
01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:40.150
Would you like a drink?
- Yes?


1015
01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:42.440
No, thank you. Very kind.

1016
01:17:43.230 --> 01:17:45.020
Really, I'm so sorry.

1017
01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.400
I'll buy another.

1018
01:17:47.730 --> 01:17:51.440
One thing at least
that Agnès won't sell in secret.


1019
01:17:52.650 --> 01:17:53.650
But Serge...

1020
01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:59.480
Stéphane caught Agnès stealing shoes
from your little collection.


1021
01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:00.860
You should check.

1022
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:02.480
No, Serge. Please...

1023
01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:05.900
Ridiculous! Nothing is missing!
- It's not true!


1024
01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:09.190
Agnès, Stéphane will be moving in with us.

1025
01:18:10.150 --> 01:18:12.230
I'll need the cottage.
- No!


1026
01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:13.520
She's not leaving!

1027
01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:15.110
I didn't ask, I swear!

1028
01:18:15.150 --> 01:18:16.520
Stéphane...
- I swear!


1029
01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:19.020
You'll bring your things
Monday.


1030
01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.650
No, Serge. It's out of the question!

1031
01:18:21.690 --> 01:18:23.900
This is my home.
You're in my house!


1032
01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:25.610
I want Agnès gone!

1033
01:18:25.650 --> 01:18:29.190
Why is it only shit
that comes out of your mouth?


1034
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:32.560
Can't you shut up for once?

1035
01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:35.110
Agnès is staying with us.

1036
01:18:54.270 --> 01:18:55.900
Can I ask you a question?

1037
01:18:56.860 --> 01:18:58.310
Why do you stay?

1038
01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:01.440
I dunno.

1039
01:19:02.230 --> 01:19:03.650
I feel good here.

1040
01:19:03.690 --> 01:19:04.560
Really?

1041
01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:06.650
Everybody here's nuts.

1042
01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:07.770
Yeah.

1043
01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:13.770
As soon as I'm 18, I'm gone.

1044
01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:15.770
Yeah?

1045
01:19:16.150 --> 01:19:17.480
Where'll you go?

1046
01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.520
Back home to Sydney.
All my friends are there.


1047
01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.900
I'll take photography at university.

1048
01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.690
A gallery wants to show my work.

1049
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:28.400
That's amazing!

1050
01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:30.900
Can I have a look?

1051
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:33.270
I dunno.

1052
01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:37.360
Why not? If you want, I'll show you.
- Great.


1053
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:41.980
Too bad we won't
get to know each other.

1054
01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.190
You're my niece, I guess.

1055
01:19:47.190 --> 01:19:48.480
Strange, isn't it?

1056
01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:52.060
Are you glad?

1057
01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.190
Why?

1058
01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:56.310
That I'm part of the family.

1059
01:19:57.940 --> 01:19:58.980
Honestly?

1060
01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:05.150
For me, family's the worst.

1061
01:20:07.190 --> 01:20:09.020
It's poison in your blood.

1062
01:20:12.230 --> 01:20:13.440
A contamination

1063
01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:16.270
that makes you sick.

1064
01:20:21.190 --> 01:20:22.360
But still,

1065
01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:24.940
I mean, it's nice.

1066
01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:28.770
I'm cold, I'm going in.

1067
01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:32.810
Good night.

1068
01:20:33.150 --> 01:20:33.940
Yeah.

1069
01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:07.020
It's settled.

1070
01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.150
Agnès will leave at
the end of the month.

1071
01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:16.520
Her cottage is...

1072
01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:17.690
very pleasant.

1073
01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:21.230
You'll be comfortable there.

1074
01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.400
Good night.

1075
01:21:42.150 --> 01:21:45.900
You've been convened
for Mr Dumontet's appeal


1076
01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:48.730
contesting the guardianship I ordered.

1077
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:53.650
Ms Ajello, you support this appeal
and request we hear from


1078
01:21:53.690 --> 01:21:56.230
Stéphane Marson,
Mr Dumontet's daughter.


1079
01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:59.810
Counsel, have you seen this request?

1080
01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:01.520
Of course, your honor.

1081
01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:04.980
Good. Ms Ajello, what are the new elements
in this case?


1082
01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:09.860
I requested this hearing
as I have in my possession


1083
01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:14.690
a certain number of elements proving
that the request for guardianship


1084
01:22:14.730 --> 01:22:16.400
is absolutely abusive.

1085
01:22:16.770 --> 01:22:21.150
The request is based only on lies,
pretenses and slander.


1086
01:22:21.610 --> 01:22:23.770
As you can see, I am filing

1087
01:22:23.810 --> 01:22:26.770
first, Mr Dumontet's
complete medical file,


1088
01:22:26.810 --> 01:22:28.980
proving he is in perfect health.

1089
01:22:29.690 --> 01:22:32.440
And I'm calling on Ms Marson, his daughter,

1090
01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:35.190
so that she can finally tell
her story.


1091
01:22:35.230 --> 01:22:38.440
Your honor, forgive me.
They only met in January.


1092
01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:41.150
Madame...
- I wanted to begin by saying


1093
01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:45.440
that Ms Marson sought to remain
outside of this dispute.


1094
01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:49.440
However, given the gravity of the accusations

1095
01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:52.650
facing her father,
she felt she had to speak out.


1096
01:22:54.190 --> 01:22:57.230
Counsel for the applicants?
- Yes, your honor.


1097
01:22:57.270 --> 01:23:01.230
My clients reject the entirety
of Ms Marson's allegations.


1098
01:23:02.230 --> 01:23:04.810
Which they deem completely self-serving.

1099
01:23:05.190 --> 01:23:06.400
It's all a lie.

1100
01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:11.360
She was never in his life. As my client said,
they've known each other two months.


1101
01:23:12.230 --> 01:23:14.110
We will ask the witness.

1102
01:23:14.150 --> 01:23:18.860
Ms Marson, do you confirm that you've been
close to your father for years?


1103
01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:25.190
In fact,

1104
01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:29.480
Serge and I always
saw each other in secret.

1105
01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.730
You'll be sorry you meddled!
- Please!


1106
01:23:31.770 --> 01:23:32.610
And...

1107
01:23:33.690 --> 01:23:37.360
He looked after me
when I had money problems, or...


1108
01:23:38.190 --> 01:23:39.440
when Mom died.

1109
01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:46.730
He was always very attentive
and I have to say even...


1110
01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:48.730
very tender with me.

1111
01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:52.940
The three of us,

1112
01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:56.480
with Mom, would spend
the weekend in St-Maxime.


1113
01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:00.810
He always bought me comic books,

1114
01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:02.360
clothes...

1115
01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.650
Ms Marson...

1116
01:24:03.690 --> 01:24:07.900
I have a very important question.
Please think before answering.


1117
01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:12.560
Do you believe Mr Dumontet
is in full possession of his faculties?


1118
01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:14.810
He has always...

1119
01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:17.610
Even if he is reduced...

1120
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:19.190
physically...

1121
01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.060
he's someone who has...

1122
01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:24.730
spirit and convictions.

1123
01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:26.770
And he has many worries.

1124
01:24:26.810 --> 01:24:27.940
I can't stay!

1125
01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:29.650
Yes, stay. Stay.

1126
01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:30.650
But,

1127
01:24:30.690 --> 01:24:32.520
to be honest...
- Finally!


1128
01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.860
It's true that, since his stroke,

1129
01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.860
he's changed a lot.

1130
01:24:38.730 --> 01:24:39.560
Go on.

1131
01:24:40.150 --> 01:24:41.400
He has frequent

1132
01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:43.360
fainting spells,

1133
01:24:45.190 --> 01:24:46.230
absences...

1134
01:24:47.650 --> 01:24:49.690
He's increasingly incoherent.

1135
01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:53.150
And when he notices, you know,

1136
01:24:53.190 --> 01:24:54.560
he loses his cool.

1137
01:24:55.610 --> 01:24:56.900
What are you saying?

1138
01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:59.060
And these past weeks,

1139
01:24:59.690 --> 01:25:01.770
I spent a lot of time with him.

1140
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:04.860
And I've seen Serge

1141
01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:05.860
go...

1142
01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:17.480
I'm sorry.

1143
01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:19.810
Take your time.

1144
01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:27.980
I've seen Serge

1145
01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:30.270
fly into horrible rages.

1146
01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:32.360
He became violent.

1147
01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:34.770
Very violent with George,

1148
01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:36.610
very violent with Louise.

1149
01:25:37.230 --> 01:25:38.610
With Agnès, too.

1150
01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:45.810
I know this isn't what you expected,

1151
01:25:46.610 --> 01:25:48.270
but I just can't lie.

1152
01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:51.520
George and Louise have only...

1153
01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:53.190
your well-being in mind.

1154
01:25:53.690 --> 01:25:56.610
When they try to help,
you threaten them.


1155
01:25:56.650 --> 01:25:57.980
It can't go on.

1156
01:25:58.020 --> 01:25:59.690
It can't. And for them,

1157
01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:01.150
it's not fair.

1158
01:26:04.690 --> 01:26:07.480
Sometimes you don't remember things.

1159
01:26:09.610 --> 01:26:11.810
Remember what you did to George?

1160
01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.940
You strangled her.

1161
01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:18.650
And Saturday...

1162
01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:21.310
I was in the bath.

1163
01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:23.610
He came in...

1164
01:26:26.730 --> 01:26:28.110
You stripped naked,

1165
01:26:29.650 --> 01:26:31.270
got in the tub with me.

1166
01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:34.480
You touched me.

1167
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:55.150
Alright.

1168
01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:58.940
I can't rule on this basis.

1169
01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:00.400
So I'll order

1170
01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:03.310
an evaluation, both psychiatric

1171
01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:04.940
and social.

1172
01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:12.020
Mr Dumontet, do you understand
what I've just decreed?


1173
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:15.690
A psychiatric and social evaluation?

1174
01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:19.770
Sir?

1175
01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.560
Mr Dumontet?

1176
01:27:21.610 --> 01:27:22.440
Serge?

1177
01:27:24.610 --> 01:27:25.610
Counsel?

1178
01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:27.110
Mr Dumontet?

1179
01:27:31.150 --> 01:27:32.810
Mr Dumontet?
- Serge?


1180
01:29:04.230 --> 01:29:06.060
One day we were eating,

1181
01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.230
with George and Louise.

1182
01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:15.520
They talked about me as if I couldn't hear,
when I was right in front of them.


1183
01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:19.730
As if I was already dead.

1184
01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:22.770
They were after my money.

1185
01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:26.150
Like you.

1186
01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:30.400
So I went down to the cellar

1187
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:33.650
and took one of the hunting rifles.

1188
01:29:34.610 --> 01:29:37.190
But when I tried to aim at them,

1189
01:29:39.150 --> 01:29:42.560
my arms started to shake.
I didn't have the strength.


1190
01:29:43.610 --> 01:29:45.520
The gun was too heavy.

1191
01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:48.860
So,

1192
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:53.690
when I saw you arrive at the port,

1193
01:29:53.730 --> 01:29:56.110
I thought, someone who can do that...

1194
01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.940
pretend to be my daughter...

1195
01:30:03.650 --> 01:30:05.440
She's a gift from heaven.

1196
01:30:09.230 --> 01:30:10.400
My daughter...

1197
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:12.730
I searched for her.

1198
01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:16.650
And then one day I found her.

1199
01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:20.020
I even attended her trial.

1200
01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:23.730
Five years in prison

1201
01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:27.110
for pushing to her death her lover

1202
01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.400
who wouldn't leave her husband.

1203
01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:32.110
That's when you met her.

1204
01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:34.400
In prison.

1205
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:36.360
Wasn't it?

1206
01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:38.690
What do you take me for?

1207
01:30:40.230 --> 01:30:41.610
I know everything.

1208
01:30:42.110 --> 01:30:44.690
You're Nathalie Cordier, an orphan,

1209
01:30:45.730 --> 01:30:47.940
investigated numerous times

1210
01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.480
for identity theft.

1211
01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:52.110
How much did you make?

1212
01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:58.940
Did you see?
I copied George's haircut.


1213
01:30:59.310 --> 01:31:00.770
She's so beautiful.

1214
01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:02.690
And Louise...

1215
01:31:02.730 --> 01:31:05.480
I never met anyone like her.
Extraordinary.


1216
01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:07.060
Help me!
- And...


1217
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:09.900
Louise told me.
Frédéric's not dead.


1218
01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:12.980
I'd like to meet him.
I always wanted a brother.


1219
01:31:14.810 --> 01:31:15.860
I'd love it.

1220
01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:18.690
And it would make Louise so happy.

1221
01:31:20.150 --> 01:31:22.560
You've no idea where he might be?

1222
01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:27.190
Are you serious when you say that?

1223
01:31:27.230 --> 01:31:28.440
Yes, of course.

1224
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:30.810
It'd be fantastic.

1225
01:31:31.690 --> 01:31:33.190
Is that the reason?

1226
01:31:34.730 --> 01:31:36.690
You were looking for a family?

1227
01:31:38.730 --> 01:31:40.190
My fucking god!

1228
01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:44.270
I was such an idiot.

1229
01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:48.810
OK, I'm calling the cops.

1230
01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:52.020
No, don't move.
- Get off me!


1231
01:31:52.650 --> 01:31:54.440
You'll have another stroke!

1232
01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:56.310
You bitch!

1233
01:31:56.770 --> 01:31:58.270
Just like George!

1234
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:59.770
Stop it.

1235
01:31:59.810 --> 01:32:01.020
Stop it.

1236
01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:01.810
Stop.

1237
01:33:54.810 --> 01:33:56.610
Please, something's wrong!

1238
01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:58.480
Please!

1239
01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:01.860
Please, my father!

1240
01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:02.980
What's wrong?

1241
01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:04.480
It's... I don't know.

1242
01:34:31.770 --> 01:34:33.810
<i>Leave a message, thanks.</i>

1243
01:34:46.230 --> 01:34:49.810
<i>The Dumontet family mourns the loss
of Serge Dumontet</i>


1244
01:35:13.230 --> 01:35:14.310
What's wrong?

1245
01:35:21.610 --> 01:35:23.310
Still dreaming of Nathalie?

1246
01:35:23.730 --> 01:35:24.730
What?

1247
01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:26.400
You still don't get it?

1248
01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:28.980
It's what she does, ask anyone.

1249
01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:32.770
She hits on prison chicks,
reels them in, and when she's bored,


1250
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:33.690
she ghosts'em.

1251
01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:38.230
Fuck!

1252
01:35:39.190 --> 01:35:40.560
Leave me alone!

1253
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:30.440
<i>Normally you could attend
your father's funeral</i>


1254
01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.230
<i>accompanied by several officers, of course.</i>

1255
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:37.650
<i>But what can I do?
Nothing proves he's your father.</i>


1256
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:42.310
Don't you have a letter?
Something showing you're his daughter?


1257
01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:43.560
No.

1258
01:36:44.150 --> 01:36:45.360
There's nothing.

1259
01:36:46.190 --> 01:36:48.730
Mom refused to help me.
- Stéphane,


1260
01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:53.150
even if I believed you,
there's nothing I can do. Forget it.


1261
01:37:27.770 --> 01:37:29.810
<i>Leave a message, thanks.</i>

1262
01:42:09.730 --> 01:42:11.060
Why are you here?

1263
01:42:11.610 --> 01:42:12.900
You ran away?

1264
01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:16.940
Are you crazy?
They'll be searching for you everywhere!


1265
01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:19.940
Wait, you have to be back by 7.

1266
01:42:20.610 --> 01:42:22.480
You'll ruin all our plans...

1267
01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:24.980
Your early release.
- Answer me!


1268
01:42:26.150 --> 01:42:28.730
Were you in a fight?
- Don't touch me!


1269
01:42:29.190 --> 01:42:30.190
Excuse me...

1270
01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:32.980
Excuse me, madame.
Who invited you?


1271
01:42:33.690 --> 01:42:34.900
I wasn't invited.

1272
01:42:37.230 --> 01:42:38.270
I'm Stéphane.

1273
01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:41.520
Serge's daughter.

1274
01:42:46.230 --> 01:42:47.560
What do you mean?

1275
01:42:48.110 --> 01:42:49.560
I'm Serge's daughter!

1276
01:42:49.610 --> 01:42:51.190
She's completely crazy!

1277
01:42:51.810 --> 01:42:52.690
Jesus!

1278
01:42:54.020 --> 01:42:54.860
But...

1279
01:42:56.110 --> 01:42:57.150
She's lying!

1280
01:42:58.520 --> 01:42:59.860
You don't understand.

1281
01:43:01.310 --> 01:43:03.860
You pretend you're me
while I'm in jail?


1282
01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:06.810
Is that it?
- I'll ask you to leave.


1283
01:43:08.690 --> 01:43:09.690
Excuse me?

1284
01:43:10.190 --> 01:43:11.060
Leave.

1285
01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:12.480
But...

1286
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:15.980
I'll tell everyone the truth.

1287
01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:19.730
The truth is you broke in here.

1288
01:43:20.110 --> 01:43:22.270
My sister and I are in mourning.

1289
01:43:22.810 --> 01:43:24.150
I'm your sister!

1290
01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:27.610
I'm Serge's daughter!

1291
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:30.230
He's my father!
- I understand.


1292
01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:35.810
But inside are all our local officials,
police chiefs, judges


1293
01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:37.560
and two former ministers.

1294
01:43:38.150 --> 01:43:40.810
If you go in,
I'll say you attacked me.

1295
01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:47.310
Why?

1296
01:43:51.230 --> 01:43:52.190
You'll pay!

1297
01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:22.440
Stéphane?

1298
01:44:23.310 --> 01:44:24.150
Yes?

1299
01:44:24.650 --> 01:44:27.520
Where did Serge keep the keys
to the cellar?


1300
01:44:27.810 --> 01:44:29.860
They should be in his office.

1301
01:44:30.690 --> 01:44:32.610
Could you bring them to us?

1302
01:44:35.190 --> 01:44:36.150
What for?

1303
01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:40.980
For 30 years we
couldn't go near his bottles.

1304
01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:43.810
We'll make up for lost time!

1305
01:44:55.150 --> 01:44:56.480
Can I have one?
- Sure.


1306
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:58.190
Jeanne!

1307
01:44:59.110 --> 01:45:03.020
Leave her. If she smokes in secret
or here, it's all the same.


1308
01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:06.060
Can I have one?
- Help yourself!


1309
01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:09.270
Thank you.

1310
01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:17.940
Can I squeeze in?

1311
01:45:19.190 --> 01:45:22.440
Agnès, you're wearing
the earrings I gave you.


1312
01:45:23.190 --> 01:45:24.230
I'm so glad.

1313
01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:33.560
Stéphane, come join us.

1314
01:45:36.270 --> 01:45:37.610
Where shall I sit?

1315
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:10.310
What is it now?
Can't you be still one minute?


1316
01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:20.860
What the fuck?

1317
01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:22.150
You're crazy!

1318
01:48:22.190 --> 01:48:23.770
Stop it! Stop!

1319
01:48:23.810 --> 01:48:24.690
Stop!

1320
01:48:25.610 --> 01:48:26.690
Gimme that!

1321
01:48:27.190 --> 01:48:28.360
Stop, shit!

1322
01:48:29.810 --> 01:48:31.110
Get off me!

1323
01:48:31.610 --> 01:48:32.730
Stop it!

1324
01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:34.520
Gimme that!

1325
01:48:41.610 --> 01:48:44.020
Stéphane, you're insane!
- Go away!


1326
01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:45.360
Leave me alone!

1327
01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:46.770
Stéphane!

1328
01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:51.360
You don't understand.

1329
01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:53.690
I'm with my family.
My dad just died!


1330
01:48:54.110 --> 01:48:54.980
What?

1331
01:48:55.270 --> 01:48:57.060
Put yourself in my shoes.

1332
01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:02.150
Ever since I was born Mom kept telling me
what a bastard Dad was.


1333
01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:05.900
And that she'd dance on his grave
the day he died.


1334
01:49:06.690 --> 01:49:08.400
So, you know, I...

1335
01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.150
I wanted to meet him...

1336
01:49:10.190 --> 01:49:11.730
that man, to hear...

1337
01:49:11.770 --> 01:49:13.610
his version. You know?

1338
01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:15.520
Why are you jealous?

1339
01:49:16.150 --> 01:49:17.480
It's you I love!

1340
01:49:20.770 --> 01:49:22.520
What are you playing at?

1341
01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:23.730
I need you!

1342
01:49:23.770 --> 01:49:25.110
What are you doing?

1343
01:49:27.020 --> 01:49:28.770
He's my father.

1344
01:49:28.810 --> 01:49:29.770
I love you!

1345
01:49:29.810 --> 01:49:31.310
You're all I have!

1346
01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:32.650
All I have.

1347
01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:34.810
You're hurting me.

1348
01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:37.230
Shit!

1349
01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:28.520
You put on perfume?

1350
01:53:29.230 --> 01:53:30.150
Yes.

1351
01:53:31.690 --> 01:53:33.810
I don't know what it is.

1352
01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:34.900
The wine...

1353
01:53:35.310 --> 01:53:37.900
It didn't agree with me. I was sick.

1354
01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:41.560
A shame! Perhaps the bottles are too old.

1355
01:53:42.730 --> 01:53:44.400
I'll close the shutters.

1356
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:47.440
I'll turn in.

1357
01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:51.440
I'll turn in, too.

1358
01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:52.560
You, Jeanne?

1359
01:53:52.610 --> 01:53:53.650
The same.

1360
01:54:00.690 --> 01:54:03.060
Stéphane, could you clean up?

1361
01:54:03.810 --> 01:54:06.440
I don't like leaving a mess.

1362
01:54:47.310 --> 01:54:48.150
Yes?

1363
01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:52.230
I'll let you in.

1364
01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:53.560
Who is it?

1365
01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:57.480
Who is it?

1366
01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:17.270
Hello, George.

1367
01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:18.650
Hello.
- Hello.


1368
01:55:19.230 --> 01:55:20.360
How are you?

1369
01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:23.360
We buried my dad today.
- Of course.


1370
01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:26.150
I know it's late.
We're looking for someone.


1371
01:55:27.610 --> 01:55:30.020
What's... Oh, Flavien.
- Hello.


1372
01:55:30.060 --> 01:55:32.730
Hi, Youssef. How are you?
- Fine, thanks.


1373
01:55:32.770 --> 01:55:34.190
Our condolences.

1374
01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:37.270
Your husband did so much
for the town.


1375
01:55:38.860 --> 01:55:42.190
You're kind to have come all this way
to say that.


1376
01:55:42.980 --> 01:55:45.860
Actually, we're looking for
a missing convict.


1377
01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:49.150
How was my husband involved?

1378
01:55:49.190 --> 01:55:50.980
She claimed to be his daughter.

1379
01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:53.400
She'd applied for permission

1380
01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:55.650
to attend Mr Dumontet's funeral.

1381
01:55:57.730 --> 01:55:59.060
Do you know her?

1382
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:04.060
No, I've never seen her.

1383
01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:07.940
I have. She was here this afternoon.

1384
01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:09.560
When?

1385
01:56:09.610 --> 01:56:12.610
Are you sure?
- Absolutely! She was wearing...


1386
01:56:12.650 --> 01:56:14.650
a leather jacket and jeans.

1387
01:56:14.690 --> 01:56:16.440
Imagine, at a funeral!

1388
01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:18.610
I saw her too. 
She was weird.

1389
01:56:19.150 --> 01:56:21.690
Did she escape? 
Is she dangerous?

1390
01:56:21.730 --> 01:56:23.440
For now we don't know.

1391
01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:25.310
I see.
- And you, madame?


1392
01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:27.400
Could you come here?

1393
01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:30.810
Hello.
- Hello.


1394
01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:34.860
Yes, well... I don't know her.

1395
01:56:34.900 --> 01:56:36.610
I'll show you the photo.

1396
01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:45.060
I've never seen her.

1397
01:56:45.110 --> 01:56:46.270
Stéphane Marson.

1398
01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:47.940
Ring a bell?

1399
01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:54.690
Her phone pings here, so if you don't mind
we'll look around.


1400
01:56:54.730 --> 01:56:56.440
To avoid any problems.

1401
01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:58.440
George, I'll leave my card.

1402
01:56:58.480 --> 01:56:59.900
Yes, thank you.

1403
01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:01.810
We'll keep you informed.

1404
01:57:01.860 --> 01:57:02.980
Take care.

1405
01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:05.900
Good night.
- Thank you.


1406
01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:11.230
I'll call her.
- Good idea.


1407
01:58:11.690 --> 01:58:17.310
