00:02:44.986 --> 00:02:47.853
<i>This is the universe.</i>

2
00:02:47.948 --> 00:02:49.655
<i>Big, isn't it?</i>

3
00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:54.990
<i>Thousands of suns, myriads of stars,</i>

4
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.822
<i>separated by immense distances</i>

5
00:02:57.916 --> 00:03:00.533
<i>and by thin, floating clouds of gas.</i>

6
00:03:01.628 --> 00:03:04.461
<i>The starlight makes the gas transparent,</i>

7
00:03:04.548 --> 00:03:06.539
<i>and where there are no stars,</i>

8
00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:09.466
<i>it appears as dark, obscuring clouds,</i>

9
00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:13.046
<i>like that great black cone over there.</i>

10
00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:18.927
<i>Hello. There's a nova.</i>

11
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.887
<i>A whole solar system exploded.</i>

12
00:03:21.982 --> 00:03:24.940
<i>Someone must have been messing about
with the uranium atom.</i>


13
00:03:25.777 --> 00:03:29.361
<i>No, it's not our solar system,
I'm glad to say.</i>


14
00:03:36.246 --> 00:03:40.581
<i>Ah, those are called
a globular cluster of stars.</i>


15
00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:43.075
<i>Rather fine.</i>

16
00:03:49.134 --> 00:03:51.375
<i>Down here in the right-hand corner,</i>

17
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.132
<i>see that little chap
rather like a Boy Scout's badge?</i>


18
00:03:55.015 --> 00:03:58.849
<i>It's a mass of gas expanding
at thousands of cubic miles a minute.</i>


19
00:04:08.028 --> 00:04:10.941
<i>Ah, here we are.
We 're getting near a home.</i>


20
00:04:11.031 --> 00:04:13.819
<i>The moon, our moon, in the first quarter.</i>

21
00:04:15.202 --> 00:04:17.819
<i>And here's the Earth, our Earth,</i>

22
00:04:17.913 --> 00:04:20.029
<i>moving around in its place,</i>

23
00:04:20.123 --> 00:04:23.286
<i>part of the pattern, part of the universe.</i>

24
00:04:24.127 --> 00:04:25.834
<i>Reassuring, isn't it?</i>

25
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.253
<i>It's night over Europe,
the night of the 2nd of May, 1945.</i>


26
00:04:35.347 --> 00:04:37.839
<i>That point of fire is a burning city.</i>

27
00:04:37.933 --> 00:04:40.846
<i>It had a thousand-bomber raid an hour ago.</i>

28
00:04:50.278 --> 00:04:54.772
<i>And here, rolling in over the Atlantic,
is a real English fog.</i>


29
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.317
<i>I hope all our aircraft got home safely.</i>

30
00:04:59.746 --> 00:05:02.158
<i>
- Even the my ships sound frightened</i>

31
00:05:03.542 --> 00:05:07.001
<i>Listen to all the noises in the air.</i>

32
00:05:07.087 --> 00:05:10.296
<i>This was their finest hour.</i>

33
00:05:10.382 --> 00:05:13.420
Listen.

34
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.092
<i>Listen.</i>

38
00:05:24.646 --> 00:05:26.512
<i>Did you get that? 
That's very important.</i>

39
00:05:26.606 --> 00:05:28.938
<i>Education interrupted,
violently interrupted.</i>


40

53
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:07.511
Hello, Lancaster.

54
00:06:07.606 --> 00:06:10.644
We are sending signals.
Can you see our signals?


55

What's your name?

00:06:59.532 --> 00:07:03.446
Are you receiving me?
Repeat, are you receiving me?

Request your position. Come in, Lancaster.

62
00:07:05.956 --> 00:07:08.156
You seem like a nice girl.
I can't give you my position.


63
00:07:08.208 --> 00:07:09.949
Instrument's gone. 
Crew gone too.

64
00:07:10.043 --> 00:07:12.159
All except Bob here, my sparks, he's dead.

65
00:07:12.253 --> 00:07:15.791
The rest all bailed out on my orders.
Time out 3:35. You get that?


66
00:07:15.882 --> 00:07:17.714
Crew bailed out 03:35.

<i>Stat/on Warrenden,

Station Warrenden,
bomber group apple, George.


70
00:07:24.224 --> 00:07:26.386
They'll be sorry about Bob.
We all liked him.


71
00:07:27.978 --> 00:07:31.846
Hello, George.
Hello, George. Are you all right?


72
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.147
Are you going to try and land?
Do you want a fix?


73
00:07:34.234 --> 00:07:36.316
The name's not George.
It's Peter.


74
00:07:36.403 --> 00:07:38.519
Peter D. Carter. “D” is for David.

75
00:07:38.613 --> 00:07:40.675
Squadron Leader Peter Carter.
No, I'm not going to land.


76
00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:43.066
Undercarriage is gone,
inner port's on fire.


77
00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:45.116
I'm bailing out presently.
I'm bailing out.

You'll have to write this for me,
but what I want her to know is

that I love her very much,

86
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:08.553
that I've never shown it to her,
not really,

- What's your name?
- June.


92
00:08:25.452 --> 00:08:28.945
Yes, June, I'm bailing out.
I'm bailing out, but there's a catch.


93
00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:31.576
- I've got no parachute.
- Uh _


94
00:08:31.666 --> 00:08:34.283
Hello. Hello, Peter. 
Do not understand.

95
00:08:35.962 --> 00:08:38.454
Hello. Hello, Peter. 
Can you hear me?

96
00:08:38.548 --> 00:08:41.381
<i>Hello, June.
Don 't be afraid. It' 's quite simple.</i>


97
00:08:41.968 --> 00:08:45.006
We've had it, and
I'd rather jump than fry.

98
00:08:45.096 --> 00:08:47.158
After the first thousand feet,
what's the difference?


99
00:08:47.182 --> 00:08:49.014
I shan't know anything anyway.

100
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.216
I say, I hope I haven't frightened you.

101
00:08:52.395 --> 00:08:54.853
- No, I'm not frightened.
<i>- Good girl.</i>


102
00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.477
Your sparks - You said he was dead.
Hasn't he got a chute?


103
00:08:58.568 --> 00:09:01.560
Cut to ribbons. Cannon shell.
June, are you pretty?


104
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.361
Not bad.

105
00:09:03.448 --> 00:09:05.985
<i>- Can you hear me as well as I hear you?
- Yes.</i>


106
00:09:06.076 --> 00:09:08.408
You've got a good voice.
You've got guts too.


107
00:09:08.495 --> 00:09:11.495
It's funny, I've known dozens of girls.
I've been in love with some of them.


108
00:09:11.539 --> 00:09:14.782
But an American girl whom I've never seen
and who I never shall see


109
00:09:14.876 --> 00:09:16.412
will hear my last words.

110
00:09:16.503 --> 00:09:18.665
That's funny. It's rather sweet.

111
00:09:19.214 --> 00:09:22.047
June, if you're around
when they pick me up,


112
00:09:22.133 --> 00:09:23.623
turn your head away.

113
00:09:24.886 --> 00:09:28.129
Perhaps we can do something, Peter.
Let me report it.


114
00:09:28.223 --> 00:09:31.682
<i>No, no one can help. Only you.
Let me do this in my own way.</i>


115
00:09:31.768 --> 00:09:34.726
<i>I want to be alone with you, June.
Where were you born?</i>


116
00:09:35.897 --> 00:09:37.103
<i>- Boston.
- Mass?</i>


117
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.021
Yes.

118
00:09:38.108 --> 00:09:40.099
That's a place to be born.
History was made there.


119
00:09:40.193 --> 00:09:42.393
Are you in love with anybody?
No. No, don't answer that.


120
00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:44.645
I could love a man like you, Peter.

121
00:09:44.739 --> 00:09:46.980
I love you, June.
You're life, and I'm leaving you.


122
00:09:47.075 --> 00:09:48.486
Where do you live, on the station?

123
00:09:48.576 --> 00:09:51.409
No, in a big country house
about five miles from here.


124
00:09:51.496 --> 00:09:52.986
- Lee Wood House.
- Old <i>house?</i>


125
00:09:53.081 --> 00:09:54.196
Yes, very old.

126
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.201
Good. I'll be a ghost
and come and see you.


127
00:09:56.292 --> 00:09:58.979
You're not frightened of ghosts, are you?
It would be awful if you were.


128
00:09:59.003 --> 00:10:01.961
<i>- I'm not frightened.
- What time will you be home?</i>


129
00:10:02.048 --> 00:10:03.755
Well, I'm on duty till 6:00.

130
00:10:03.842 --> 00:10:06.925
I have breakfast in the mess
and then I have to cycle half an hour.


131
00:10:07.011 --> 00:10:09.002
I often go along the sands.

132
00:10:09.973 --> 00:10:11.589
This is such nonsense.

133
00:10:11.683 --> 00:10:13.674
No, it's not.
It's the best sense I ever heard.


134
00:10:13.768 --> 00:10:16.886
I was lucky to get you, June.
It can't be helped about the parachute.


135
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.062
I'll have my wings soon anyway.
Big white ones.


136
00:10:19.149 --> 00:10:22.232
I hope they haven't gone all modern.
I'd hate to have a prop instead of wings.


137
00:10:22.735 --> 00:10:25.727
<i>What do you think the next world's like?
I've got my own ideas.</i>


138
00:10:25.822 --> 00:10:26.653
Oh, Peter.

139
00:10:26.739 --> 00:10:29.718
I think it starts where this one leaves off
or where this one could leave off


140
00:10:29.742 --> 00:10:32.609
if we'd listened
to Plato and Aristotle and Jesus.


141
00:10:32.704 --> 00:10:36.572
With all of our little earthly problems solved,
but with greater ones worth the solving.


142
00:10:36.666 --> 00:10:39.374
I'll know soon enough anyway.
I'm signing off now, June.


143
00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.950
Good-bye! Good-bye, June!

144
00:10:41.045 --> 00:10:44.003
Hello, “G” for George? 
Hello, “G” George?

145
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.582
Hello, “G” George? Hello -

146
00:10:52.015 --> 00:10:53.926
So long, Bob. I'll
see you in a minute.

147
00:10:54.017 --> 00:10:57.351
You'll know what we wear by now -
a prop or wings.


148
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.423
<i>A prop or wings.</i>

149
00:11:29.802 --> 00:11:32.260
<i>Prop or wings.</i>

150
00:11:33.598 --> 00:11:36.636
<i>Prop or wings.</i>

151
00:11:37.894 --> 00:11:41.057
<i>Prop or wings.</i>

152
00:11:42.065 --> 00:11:45.274
<i>Prop or wings.</i>

153
00:11:46.361 --> 00:11:49.353
<i>Prop or wings.</i>

154
00:12:21.479 --> 00:12:23.641
Oh, bad luck, old boy.

155
00:13:15.241 --> 00:13:16.857
Name and rank?

156
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.157
Come on, fellows, break it up.
Spread out here.


157
00:14:03.998 --> 00:14:05.614
Room with bath.

158
00:14:05.708 --> 00:14:08.496
- Oh, uh, do you have USO shows here?
- No, we don't.


159
00:14:08.586 --> 00:14:10.202
Okay, we'll stay.

160
00:14:11.172 --> 00:14:14.085
- Officer's quarters, of course.
- We're all the same up here, Captain.


161
00:14:14.634 --> 00:14:17.501
Excuse me... brother.

162
00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:26.555
Take over.

163
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.314
- I wish I could make a phone call.
- From here? That would be long distance.


164
00:14:32.026 --> 00:14:34.518
- Flying Officer Trubshawe?
- Oh, I'm so sorry.


165
00:14:34.612 --> 00:14:36.353
You can't wait here any longer.

166
00:14:36.447 --> 00:14:38.438
You must be mistaken about your captain.

167
00:14:38.533 --> 00:14:41.867
- Well, if anyone's mistaken, it's not me.
- Mistakes don't happen here.


168
00:14:41.953 --> 00:14:44.115
But this is the aircrew section, isn't it?

169
00:14:44.205 --> 00:14:45.695
You should know.

170
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.781
Peter couldn't have got away with it.

171
00:14:50.837 --> 00:14:52.877
Besides, you checked
his invoice for me, didn't you?


172
00:14:52.922 --> 00:14:55.505
Yes. It was against the regulations.

173
00:14:56.217 --> 00:14:58.709
Regulations are made to be broken.

174
00:14:58.803 --> 00:15:02.467
He was due here half an hour after me. This
is his section, and he hasn't reported.


175
00:15:02.557 --> 00:15:05.549
So he's either AWOL
or there's been a mistake.


176
00:15:05.643 --> 00:15:08.180
There hasn't been a mistake here
for a thousand years.


177
00:15:08.729 --> 00:15:11.471
Oh! So there have been mistakes?

178
00:15:11.566 --> 00:15:15.059
The girl that was here before me,
she was here 640 years.


179
00:15:15.153 --> 00:15:16.268
Holy smoke!

180
00:15:16.362 --> 00:15:18.194
She said when the records don't balance,

181
00:15:18.281 --> 00:15:20.648
all of the alarm bells start ringing
in the records office.


182
00:15:20.741 --> 00:15:23.608
I bet they do. 
Proper flap, eh?

183
00:15:23.703 --> 00:15:25.068
Yes.

184
00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:38.298
That's only the living records.

185
00:15:38.384 --> 00:15:42.594
Everyone on Earth has a file -
Russian, Chinese, black, or white,


186
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.671
rich or poor, Republican or Democrat.

187
00:15:44.765 --> 00:15:46.130
Holy smoke.

188
00:15:46.225 --> 00:15:49.468
If anybody had told me the clocks were
working away up here, just like on Earth -


189
00:15:49.562 --> 00:15:51.803
Everyone here is allowed
to start how they like.


190
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.391
It's heaven, isn't it?

191
00:16:00.156 --> 00:16:02.193
You see,

192
00:16:02.283 --> 00:16:06.026
there are millions of people on Earth
who would think it heaven to be a clock.


193
00:16:07.163 --> 00:16:10.281
- And don't say, “Holy smoke.”
- Why not?


194
00:16:10.374 --> 00:16:15.460
There's no smoke without fire,
and we don't call smoke holy.


195
00:16:17.089 --> 00:16:19.501
Thanks for the gin, 
Section Officer.

196
00:16:20.051 --> 00:16:22.759
Boy, oh, boy! Home was nothing like this!

197
00:16:25.515 --> 00:16:27.131
Mine was.

198
00:16:33.272 --> 00:16:34.808
Sign here.

199
00:16:35.566 --> 00:16:38.729
Oh, all right.
I don't want to star': those bells ringing.


200
00:17:43.259 --> 00:17:45.091
I wonder where I report.

201
00:19:27.196 --> 00:19:29.608
Oh, I always hoped there would be dogs.

202
00:20:04.233 --> 00:20:05.723
Good morning.

203
00:20:06.902 --> 00:20:09.644
- Morning.
- Where do I go from here?


204
00:20:12.032 --> 00:20:13.864
- Huh?
- I'm new. I only just arrived.


205
00:20:13.951 --> 00:20:15.783
Where do I report?

206
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:17.861
You mean the aerodrome?

207
00:20:17.955 --> 00:20:19.537
Aerodrome?

208
00:20:25.546 --> 00:20:27.332
- Where am I?
- Huh?


209
00:20:27.423 --> 00:20:29.380
- This place, what's it called?
- The Boroughs.


210
00:20:29.467 --> 00:20:31.925
- The Boroughs, where?
- Lee Wood.


211
00:20:32.011 --> 00:20:33.627
- Lee Wood?
- Yeah.


212
00:20:33.721 --> 00:20:35.553
Do you know a
house called Lee Wood House?

213
00:20:35.639 --> 00:20:37.129
That's it.

214
00:20:37.224 --> 00:20:40.387
- Where the smoke is, behind those trees.
- Is that the quickest way?


215
00:20:40.478 --> 00:20:43.140
There's a track from the beach.
See that bike?


216
00:20:49.069 --> 00:20:51.777
- Who is it?
- Don't know. One of the Yank girls.


217
00:20:51.864 --> 00:20:54.231
They live up at the house.

218
00:20:59.413 --> 00:21:01.654
Here, Jock.

219
00:21:10.299 --> 00:21:11.710
Hey!

220
00:21:20.184 --> 00:21:23.347
- Hello.
- Hello yourself. What's wrong?


221
00:21:27.399 --> 00:21:28.935
You're June.

222
00:21:36.283 --> 00:21:37.694
You're Peter!

223
00:21:41.664 --> 00:21:44.076
How did you get here?

224
00:21:44.166 --> 00:21:47.784
I'm glad you're safe.
What did you do? What happened?


225
00:21:47.878 --> 00:21:49.368
I don't know. I just don't know.

226
00:21:49.463 --> 00:21:51.670
- Are you hurt?
- My head feels a bit queer.


227
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.293
Oh, there's a little cut in your hair.
It's nothing much.


228
00:21:57.346 --> 00:21:59.303
Oh, Peter, it was a cruel joke.

229
00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:01.381
If it was, it was on me.

230
00:22:01.475 --> 00:22:04.183
I've been crying so
ever since we said good-bye.


231
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.886
Don't cry, darling.

232
00:22:06.772 --> 00:22:08.809
Peter, darling.

233
00:22:20.202 --> 00:22:23.536
91,716 invoiced,

234
00:22:23.622 --> 00:22:27.240
91,715 checked in.

235
00:22:27.334 --> 00:22:29.120
Conductor 71?

236
00:22:29.211 --> 00:22:30.918
Madame, it could have happened to anybody.

237
00:22:31.005 --> 00:22:32.211
How did it happen?

238
00:22:32.298 --> 00:22:35.507
Everything was calculated
except for this accursed fog.


239
00:22:35.593 --> 00:22:39.336
The pilot jumped, he got lost in the fog,
I missed him.


240
00:22:41.223 --> 00:22:42.964
Flying Officer Trubshawe.

241
00:22:50.357 --> 00:22:52.473
You've been waiting all day for your pilot.

242
00:22:52.568 --> 00:22:53.979
Yes, ma'am.

243
00:22:54.069 --> 00:22:56.811
You see, over the Channel
we ran into this ruddy pea-souper.


244
00:22:56.906 --> 00:22:58.237
Aha.

245
00:22:58.324 --> 00:23:00.235
Oh, excuse the language, ma'am,

246
00:23:00.326 --> 00:23:02.304
but really, it was so thick that you
could have stepped out of the kite


247
00:23:02.328 --> 00:23:03.534
and walked about on it.

248
00:23:03.621 --> 00:23:04.736
<i>Sacré brouillard!</i>

249
00:23:05.664 --> 00:23:09.874
And he, the skipper, ordered everybody
to bail out when we were over the coast.


250
00:23:10.461 --> 00:23:13.328
He knew his brolly - chute -
had been written off.


251
00:23:13.422 --> 00:23:15.333
It got a direct hit
as he was bandaging me.


252
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.666
But he didn't tell the others.

253
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.172
I only knew about it
because I'd bought it by then.


254
00:23:20.262 --> 00:23:23.004
I mean, I was... dead.

255
00:23:24.683 --> 00:23:25.683
I understand.

256
00:23:25.768 --> 00:23:27.975
And I knew he'd be clocking in here,

257
00:23:28.062 --> 00:23:30.850
so I thought I'd stooge around
and wait for him.


258
00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.773
Oh, this young lady is
not to blame at all.

259
00:23:35.027 --> 00:23:37.519
- I'm sorry if I broke the rules.
- Thank you.


260
00:23:40.449 --> 00:23:43.237
Nineteen hours and 50 minutes
have elapsed.


261
00:23:43.911 --> 00:23:47.324
Don't you know that any slip
must be reported immediately?


262
00:23:47.414 --> 00:23:50.156
- I lost my head.
- Not long in the service?


263
00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.584
I joined in the so-called second germinal

264
00:23:53.671 --> 00:23:56.629
of the so-called glorious
French Revolution.


265
00:23:56.715 --> 00:23:58.797
I see. Natural death.

266
00:23:59.802 --> 00:24:01.418
I lost my head.

267
00:24:04.682 --> 00:24:06.218
The case is not so simple.

268
00:24:06.308 --> 00:24:08.174
- No?
- No.


269
00:24:08.268 --> 00:24:10.259
He's fallen in love.

270
00:24:10.354 --> 00:24:12.265
Ah!

271
00:24:12.356 --> 00:24:13.187
Oh!

272
00:24:13.273 --> 00:24:15.389
- It complicates things.
- True, madame.


273
00:24:16.026 --> 00:24:18.142
- You must do your best.
- <i>Oiu, madame.</i>


274
00:24:18.237 --> 00:24:20.774
- You'll proceed to Earth immediately.
- <i>Oui, madame</i>.


275
00:24:20.864 --> 00:24:23.902
You will explain your grave error
to Squadron Leader Carter -


276
00:24:23.993 --> 00:24:25.637
- <i>Oui, madame.</i>
- And ask him to follow you.


277
00:24:25.661 --> 00:24:27.402
- <i>Oui, madame.</i>
- Wait.


278
00:24:28.956 --> 00:24:31.493
Your captain is not an unreasonable man,
I hope?


279
00:24:31.583 --> 00:24:34.746
The skipper? Oh, no, ma'am.
Unless he's had a few, of course.


280
00:24:34.837 --> 00:24:37.169
<i>Euh, pardon?</i> "Had a few"?

281
00:24:37.256 --> 00:24:40.169
Beers.

282
00:24:41.051 --> 00:24:43.338
Scotch being hard to come by, you know.

283
00:24:43.429 --> 00:24:44.840
<i>Naturellement.</i>

284
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:48.139
By the way, monsieur, when you see Peter,
would you give him a message for me?


285
00:24:48.225 --> 00:24:51.889
<i>- Avec plaisir</i>
- Just say, “What ho.”


286
00:24:51.979 --> 00:24:53.140
<i>Bon.</i>

287
00:25:06.869 --> 00:25:11.705
One is starved for Technicolor up there.

288
00:25:15.252 --> 00:25:18.244
What a night for love.

289
00:26:28.492 --> 00:26:29.573
Drink, darling?

290
00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.555
<i>Mon ami?</i>

291
00:27:01.066 --> 00:27:02.556
Evening.

292
00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:07.528
I think I keep these for a little.

293
00:27:08.407 --> 00:27:11.525
- And how are you, my friend?
- I've never been better.


294
00:27:12.953 --> 00:27:14.443
- June, wake.
- She cannot wake.


295
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.368
We are talking in space, not in time.

296
00:27:20.294 --> 00:27:21.500
Are you cracked?

297
00:27:21.587 --> 00:27:23.419
Look at your watch.

298
00:27:24.548 --> 00:27:28.917
It has not moved since you said,
so charmingly, “Drink, darling?”


299
00:27:29.011 --> 00:27:33.505
Nor will it move, nor will anything move...

300
00:27:34.558 --> 00:27:37.175
until we have finished our little talk.

301
00:27:37.686 --> 00:27:38.926
It is only a trick.

302
00:27:40.564 --> 00:27:41.564
Who are you?

303
00:27:41.648 --> 00:27:45.391
We should have met yesterday
at 04:10, <i>mon cher.</i>


304
00:27:45.485 --> 00:27:47.271
Unfortunately, I missed you.

305
00:27:47.362 --> 00:27:49.799
Well, you couldn't have missed me
because I wasn't here. Now, who the -


306
00:27:49.823 --> 00:27:53.282
I bring you a message from Mr. Trubshawe.

307
00:27:55.579 --> 00:27:57.536
Bob? Bob's dead.

308
00:27:57.623 --> 00:28:00.285
Oh, yes, he's dead.

309
00:28:00.375 --> 00:28:02.332
He <i>says,</i> “What ho.”

310
00:28:03.295 --> 00:28:05.832
Well, that sounds like Trubshawe.
But he is dead, isn't he?


311
00:28:05.923 --> 00:28:07.630
<i>En effet.</i> But how?

312
00:28:07.716 --> 00:28:09.081
- Why?
- Cannon shell.


313
00:28:09.676 --> 00:28:13.544
And what should happen to a man
who jumps from his aircraft


314
00:28:13.639 --> 00:28:15.175
without his parachute?

315
00:28:16.099 --> 00:28:17.339
How do you know?

316
00:28:17.434 --> 00:28:21.553
But it is I who am telling you, my friend.
It is I.


317
00:28:21.647 --> 00:28:23.604
Your time was up,

318
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:27.775
but they missed you because
of your ridiculous English climate.


319
00:28:27.861 --> 00:28:29.443
I am French.

320
00:28:31.323 --> 00:28:33.735
- But what do you want now?
- You, my friend.


321
00:28:33.825 --> 00:28:35.782
- What for?
- To conduct you.


322
00:28:35.869 --> 00:28:38.486
- Where to?
- To the training center.


323
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.072
- Training for what?
- For another world.


324
00:28:44.753 --> 00:28:45.914
You don't mean -

325
00:28:46.004 --> 00:28:50.464
But, my dear friend,
that is just what I do mean.


326
00:28:51.969 --> 00:28:54.336
Oh, this is absolutely fantastic. June?

327
00:28:56.265 --> 00:28:58.176
June!

328
00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:03.432
All right. And what
if I refuse to go?

329
00:29:03.522 --> 00:29:05.388
But you cannot refuse.

330
00:29:05.482 --> 00:29:07.314
Your time was up.

331
00:29:07.401 --> 00:29:11.190
Now, by mistake, you overstayed by about,

332
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.898
speaking in time, of course, 20 hours.

333
00:29:14.992 --> 00:29:17.484
The advantage was exclusively yours.

334
00:29:17.577 --> 00:29:20.160
You lost nothing. 
You only gained.

335
00:29:20.247 --> 00:29:21.453
What about her?

336
00:29:26.753 --> 00:29:28.335
<i>Exquise.</i>

337
00:29:29.089 --> 00:29:32.002
You will see her again
when her time comes.


338
00:29:34.344 --> 00:29:37.507
She will live to be 97.

339
00:29:37.597 --> 00:29:39.087
I looked her up in the files.

340
00:29:39.182 --> 00:29:43.141
- I'm in love with her.
- But, my friend, what is love?


341
00:29:43.228 --> 00:29:45.060
The feeling of the moment.

342
00:29:45.147 --> 00:29:47.309
But I represent eternity,

343
00:29:47.399 --> 00:29:49.811
the law of this world and the other.

344
00:29:49.901 --> 00:29:52.313
- Good, but what is law?
- Law is law.


345
00:29:52.404 --> 00:29:54.486
- Yes, but law is based on reason.
- That is so.


346
00:29:54.573 --> 00:29:58.111
Now, yesterday I wasn't in love.
Today I am.


347
00:29:58.201 --> 00:30:01.489
But, my friend, what is love?
How many people are in love?


348
00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.038
Soldiers, airmen. 
How many sailors?

349
00:30:04.124 --> 00:30:06.866
Do they protest when their time is up?
No, they don't.


350
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.450
- They have no right.
- Exactly.


351
00:30:08.545 --> 00:30:09.706
- But I have.
- Why?


352
00:30:09.796 --> 00:30:13.084
Look, I've fallen in love
because of your mistake.


353
00:30:13.175 --> 00:30:16.088
I'm in an entirely different position
from what I was in last night.


354
00:30:16.178 --> 00:30:18.385
Then I expected to die,
I was ready to die,


355
00:30:18.472 --> 00:30:21.009
and it wasn't my fault that I didn't,
it was yours.


356
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.287
- What kind of government do you represent?
- I do not represent any government.


357
00:30:24.311 --> 00:30:26.151
Well, what laws govern
the place you come from?


358
00:30:26.188 --> 00:30:28.304
I am not permitted
to express any political views.


359
00:30:28.398 --> 00:30:30.981
Well, if it's a respectable place,
there must be a law of appeal.


360
00:30:31.068 --> 00:30:32.868
But, my friend, be reasonable.
Appeal to whom?


361
00:30:32.944 --> 00:30:35.184
- That's for you to find out.
- But it's never been done.


362
00:30:35.238 --> 00:30:37.900
Is that any reason
why it can't be done now?


363
00:30:37.991 --> 00:30:40.983
You are determined
to get me into this salad.


364
00:30:41.078 --> 00:30:43.240
And what about the
salad you got me into?

365
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:46.994
Now look here, you don't want me
to use force, do you?


366
00:30:47.084 --> 00:30:49.246
Well, you can always try.

367
00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.128
- I think I'll leave you for a little.
- That's the form.


368
00:30:53.215 --> 00:30:56.799
- I shall report for instructions.
- Now you're talking.


369
00:30:56.885 --> 00:31:01.846
And do not fall any deeper in love now.
You have been warned.


370
00:31:02.808 --> 00:31:05.926
She is... charming.

371
00:31:06.019 --> 00:31:08.511
You know, I think
you're not a bad chap.

372
00:31:10.565 --> 00:31:12.977
- Do you play chess?
- Yes.


373
00:31:13.068 --> 00:31:14.650
So do I.

374
00:31:14.736 --> 00:31:17.228
We could play every day.

375
00:31:18.615 --> 00:31:21.232
Some other time.

376
00:31:21.326 --> 00:31:23.738
Next time perhaps?

377
00:31:25.288 --> 00:31:26.904
<i>Au revoir, mon ami.</i>

378
00:31:34.464 --> 00:31:36.080
No, thank you, darling.

379
00:31:37.092 --> 00:31:38.582
“No, thank you” what?

380
00:31:40.053 --> 00:31:42.260
You just asked me to have a drink.

381
00:31:45.934 --> 00:31:47.345
Did I?

382
00:31:51.398 --> 00:31:53.389
Yes, I remember I did.

383
00:31:56.361 --> 00:31:57.851
What's the matter with me?

384
00:31:57.946 --> 00:32:00.483
What is it? Is it your head again?

385
00:32:00.574 --> 00:32:02.190
It might be, yes.

386
00:32:04.161 --> 00:32:05.902
An odd thing happened
while you were asleep.


387
00:32:06.913 --> 00:32:08.995
I haven't been asleep.

388
00:32:09.708 --> 00:32:11.494
Didn't you hear us talking?

389
00:32:11.585 --> 00:32:14.122
No. Who was there to talk to?

390
00:32:15.088 --> 00:32:17.079
- They sent somebody.
- “They”?


391
00:32:17.174 --> 00:32:19.085
Who are they?

392
00:32:19.801 --> 00:32:21.508
I don't know.

393
00:32:25.307 --> 00:32:27.548
June, do I look cracked?

394
00:32:27.642 --> 00:32:29.929
Not to me, darling. Are you?

395
00:32:31.271 --> 00:32:34.980
Look, there was a ten-tenths fog
last night. That's right, isn't it?


396
00:32:35.066 --> 00:32:36.648
You know there was.

397
00:32:36.735 --> 00:32:39.727
- And I did bail out without a parachute?
- That's your story.


398
00:32:40.864 --> 00:32:42.821
So how can I be alive?

399
00:32:42.908 --> 00:32:45.775
I give up. I don't
know and I don't care.

400
00:32:45.869 --> 00:32:47.780
I had no parachute. 
It was shot up.

401
00:32:47.871 --> 00:32:49.891
And when I came to this morning,
I had no parachute.


402
00:32:49.915 --> 00:32:51.531
Anyway, why wasn't I drowned?

403
00:32:51.625 --> 00:32:53.603
You don't need to prove to me
that you ought to be dead.


404
00:32:53.627 --> 00:32:55.521
Well, I ought to be,
according to this character.


405
00:32:55.545 --> 00:32:56.545
What character?

406
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:58.621
Well, this conductor character
they sent after me.


407
00:32:58.715 --> 00:33:00.501
He says he missed me in the fog.

408
00:33:00.592 --> 00:33:03.584
Bad luck for them, good luck for me.

409
00:33:04.221 --> 00:33:06.963
I told him I was going to appeal.
He's gone off to get instructions.


410
00:33:07.057 --> 00:33:08.798
It's not my fault I'm not dead.

411
00:33:08.892 --> 00:33:12.510
It's not my fault that I've found you
and fell in love with you.


412
00:33:14.481 --> 00:33:17.974
Maybe he wasn't here at all.
Hey, you, Frenchman!


413
00:33:18.735 --> 00:33:20.225
Where are you?

414
00:33:21.988 --> 00:33:24.821
- What is it?
- Oh, I've got an awful headache.


415
00:33:35.168 --> 00:33:36.454
June!

416
00:33:37.587 --> 00:33:39.419
June, you're there, aren't you?

417
00:33:39.506 --> 00:33:41.747
Yes, Peter, of course I'm here.

418
00:33:42.884 --> 00:33:44.249
Oh!

419
00:33:44.344 --> 00:33:46.335
I thought I'd lost you.

420
00:33:53.228 --> 00:33:55.219
Dr. Reeves's residence.

421
00:33:55.313 --> 00:33:57.395
Oh, good morning, Miss June.

422
00:33:57.482 --> 00:33:58.847
Yes, isn't it?

423
00:33:58.942 --> 00:34:02.480
The doctor's up in his thing,
you know, his camera obscura.


424
00:34:02.571 --> 00:34:04.608
He's got his new lens
from the shop this morning,


425
00:34:04.698 --> 00:34:06.780
and it makes a lovely picture.

426
00:34:06.866 --> 00:34:10.029
He's taken the big white garden table
to project on.


427
00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:13.704
He'll be glad you're coming over.
He's showing it to the dogs now.


428
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:15.372
Ah!

429
00:34:15.458 --> 00:34:17.290
Nice day.

430
00:34:17.377 --> 00:34:19.744
Hmm. Mrs. Bibble's ducks are too early.

431
00:34:19.838 --> 00:34:22.250
She'll lose all the eggs
if she's not careful.


432
00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.799
Ah, the start of the cycling season.

433
00:34:25.885 --> 00:34:29.378
There's a hefty young girl.
Time Mrs. Tucker went to get our rations.


434
00:34:30.473 --> 00:34:32.760
There she is.
Oh, the vicar and his sister.


435
00:34:32.851 --> 00:34:35.138
Not coming here, I hope. No. Good.

436
00:34:36.062 --> 00:34:38.599
Quite a queue at the butcher's.
Must have some offal.


437
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:41.477
Wonderful how the kids
love playing in the splash.


438
00:34:41.568 --> 00:34:42.933
Just the same in my day.

439
00:34:45.155 --> 00:34:47.522
That tree ought to come down.

440
00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.532
Old Mary looking quite skittish.

441
00:34:54.623 --> 00:34:57.115
Sally Allgood getting herself dated up.

442
00:34:57.208 --> 00:34:59.870
Ah, here's June. 
Here she comes.

443
00:35:00.545 --> 00:35:03.708
“She walks in beauty like the night.”

444
00:35:03.798 --> 00:35:06.381
Only she's cycling and the sun is out.

445
00:35:06.468 --> 00:35:10.462
Nice girl. Worth a hat full of ambassadors
in Lee Wood anyway.


446
00:35:19.606 --> 00:35:21.096
Come on up!

447
00:35:32.952 --> 00:35:35.990
- Hello, Doc.
- Hello, June. Come in. Shut the door.


448
00:35:43.129 --> 00:35:46.338
- Surveying your kingdom?
- A village doctor has to know everything.


449
00:35:46.424 --> 00:35:49.507
You would be surprised
how many diagnoses I've formed up here.


450
00:35:50.804 --> 00:35:54.547
I love looking at the village from here.
It looks so different.


451
00:35:55.934 --> 00:35:59.268
That's because you see it all clearly
and at once, as in a poet's eye.


452
00:36:00.021 --> 00:36:01.511
I want to talk to you.

453
00:36:01.606 --> 00:36:03.834
So you said on the phone,
but it's really none of my business.


454
00:36:03.858 --> 00:36:05.974
Dr. McEwen says
it's right down your street.


455
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:09.983
This is my street, a village street,
and I'm a village doctor.


456
00:36:10.073 --> 00:36:12.314
Only because you like living in a village.

457
00:36:12.409 --> 00:36:15.902
Dr. McEwen says what you don't know
about neurology would fill a peanut.


458
00:36:15.995 --> 00:36:17.952
Well, I'm a good guesser.

459
00:36:18.039 --> 00:36:20.701
Your guesses are published
by very famous magazines


460
00:36:20.792 --> 00:36:23.033
like that <i>Brain</i> I've seen in your library.

461
00:36:23.128 --> 00:36:25.119
- Dr. McEwen says -
- I know what Dr. McEwen says.


462
00:36:25.213 --> 00:36:27.204
I had a talk with him
on the phone this morning.


463
00:36:27.298 --> 00:36:28.880
Oh, did you?

464
00:36:29.426 --> 00:36:31.633
After I talked to you.

465
00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.882
This is really the RAF's business.

466
00:36:33.972 --> 00:36:36.179
Carter should have rejoined
his station today.


467
00:36:36.266 --> 00:36:39.258
- I know.
- Anyhow, what's it got to do with you?


468
00:36:39.352 --> 00:36:42.470
- Oh, I'm just interested.
- Oh, I see.


469
00:36:42.564 --> 00:36:44.601
But strictly speaking, he's a RAF case.

470
00:36:44.691 --> 00:36:48.184
He's not a case at all.
He's a person. A very fine person.


471
00:36:48.278 --> 00:36:50.019
And I want you to see him, Frank.

472
00:36:50.113 --> 00:36:53.105
I don't want just anybody mauling him about
and asking him questions.


473
00:36:53.199 --> 00:36:56.317
I want you.
I'm sure the RAF would say that-


474
00:36:56.411 --> 00:36:59.153
I know what the RAF would say.
I had a talk to his CO this morning.


475
00:36:59.247 --> 00:37:00.247
Oh, Frank.

476
00:37:00.331 --> 00:37:02.226
And I had a talk
to his group medical officer too.


477
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:04.457
- Fortunately he's heard of me.
- Oh, Frank.


478
00:37:04.544 --> 00:37:07.753
And if you'd done that earlier,
I would have told you earlier.


479
00:37:07.839 --> 00:37:10.627
You can't go around the place
kidnapping good-looking RAF officers


480
00:37:10.717 --> 00:37:12.549
just because
you like the shape of their nose.


481
00:37:12.635 --> 00:37:16.094
It's not his nose, it's his voice.
I fell for that before I ever saw him.


482
00:37:16.181 --> 00:37:18.325
He still believes that he bailed out
without a parachute?


483
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:19.805
- Yes.
- And he has hallucinations?


484
00:37:19.893 --> 00:37:20.724
Mm-hmm.

485
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:22.801
And during these bouts,
does he go rather pale?


486
00:37:22.896 --> 00:37:25.888
- Yes, yes, he did.
- And he has headaches, here?


487
00:37:25.982 --> 00:37:28.314
I think so. I don't know.
You'd better ask him.


488
00:37:28.401 --> 00:37:30.813
- But he definitely sees things?
- And hears.


489
00:37:30.904 --> 00:37:32.486
All right.

490
00:37:32.572 --> 00:37:34.904
- Did you tell him he was talking rubbish?
- No.


491
00:37:34.991 --> 00:37:36.732
- Quite right.
- He's not talking rubbish.


492
00:37:36.826 --> 00:37:38.316
He's talking very logically.

493
00:37:38.411 --> 00:37:40.698
Then he can't be in love. Bye.

494
00:37:43.291 --> 00:37:44.781
- Frank?
- Yes?


495
00:37:44.876 --> 00:37:46.867
He has a very cute nose too.

496
00:37:46.961 --> 00:37:49.168
- I'll be over about teatime.
- Right.


497
00:38:11.069 --> 00:38:12.980
It's Dr. Reeves. Let's go.

498
00:38:44.727 --> 00:38:46.343
Yippee!

499
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:59.357
That's not the way to spell Shakespeare.

500
00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:00.940
Who are you? His agent?

501
00:39:01.035 --> 00:39:03.493
“You spotted snakes with double tongues.

502
00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:06.493
Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen.

503
00:39:08.585 --> 00:39:10.417
Newts and blind worms -”

504
00:39:10.503 --> 00:39:12.164
Um
-Uh-

505
00:39:12.255 --> 00:39:14.087
- “Do no wrong.”
- “Do no wrong.


506
00:39:14.173 --> 00:39:16.380
Come not near our Fairy Queen.”

507
00:39:16.467 --> 00:39:19.710
“Oh, you can never bring in a wall.
What say you, Bottom?”


508
00:39:19.804 --> 00:39:21.010
“Some guy or other -”

509
00:39:21.097 --> 00:39:24.715
No, no, no, my dear Private Logan,
Bottom's not a gangster.


510
00:39:24.809 --> 00:39:26.174
Now, watch me.

511
00:39:26.269 --> 00:39:28.636
“Some man or other must present Wall,

512
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:30.846
and let him have some plaster
or some loam,


513
00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.433
or some rough-cast about him
to signify Wall,


514
00:39:34.527 --> 00:39:36.734
and let him hold his fingers thus,

515
00:39:36.821 --> 00:39:40.439
and through that cranny
shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.”


516
00:39:40.533 --> 00:39:42.649
- Now try that, my boy.
- Can I do the business?


517
00:39:42.744 --> 00:39:45.361
- Business as well, yes.
- Oh, brother.


518
00:39:46.122 --> 00:39:48.489
“Some man or other must present Wall,

519
00:39:48.583 --> 00:39:51.575
and let him have some plaster
or some loam,


520
00:39:51.669 --> 00:39:54.878
or some rough-cast about him
to signify Wall.”


521
00:40:17.612 --> 00:40:18.612
Check.

522
00:40:25.244 --> 00:40:27.781
Peter, check.

523
00:40:27.872 --> 00:40:31.581
“Peaseblossom. Cobweb.
Moth and mustard seed.”


524
00:40:32.627 --> 00:40:34.459
Oh, dear, I didn't see that one coming.

525
00:40:34.545 --> 00:40:37.412
“Be kind and courteous to this gentleman.

526
00:40:37.507 --> 00:40:39.919
- Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes.”
- Good afternoon.


527
00:40:40.009 --> 00:40:42.296
Hello, Frank.
Squadron Leader Carter, Dr. Reeves.


528
00:40:42.387 --> 00:40:43.673
- How do you do?
- How do you do?


529
00:40:43.763 --> 00:40:45.908
- Do I get some tea?
- Mmm. It's ordered. Ginger cookies.


530
00:40:45.932 --> 00:40:48.219
- Good. Who's winning?
- June's very good.


531
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:50.550
But he's winning. 
Sit down, everybody.

532
00:40:50.645 --> 00:40:51.851
Thanks.

533
00:40:52.897 --> 00:40:55.764
- “I beseech your worship's name.
- Thank you.


534
00:40:55.858 --> 00:40:59.101
I shall desire you of more acquaintance,
good Master Cobweb.


535
00:40:59.195 --> 00:41:01.983
If I cut my finger,
I shall make bold with you.


536
00:41:02.073 --> 00:41:04.064
Your name, honest gentleman?”

537
00:41:06.077 --> 00:41:07.988
- I told Peter.
- What?


538
00:41:08.079 --> 00:41:10.912
- Who you are, what you are, all about you.
- Mmm. Tall order.


539
00:41:10.999 --> 00:41:12.990
And I've told you all about him.

540
00:41:13.084 --> 00:41:14.995
- Has she read your poems?
- What poems?


541
00:41:15.086 --> 00:41:17.453
Well, didn't you know
this is Peter Carter?


542
00:41:18.756 --> 00:41:21.168
- I didn't know.
- We hadn't got around to that yet.


543
00:41:21.259 --> 00:41:24.047
I haven't got much modern stuff
in my library, but you're there.


544
00:41:24.137 --> 00:41:25.002
Oh, good.

545
00:41:25.096 --> 00:41:26.991
I like your point of view
and I like your English.


546
00:41:27.015 --> 00:41:29.757
- I hope we shall have some talks together.
- So do I.


547
00:41:30.518 --> 00:41:32.850
Now let's get down to this thing.

548
00:41:32.937 --> 00:41:35.349
You've never had any visions
or hallucinations before?


549
00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.272
- Never.
- What were you in civil life?


550
00:41:37.358 --> 00:41:38.769
- I was at Oxford.
- Specializing?


551
00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:41.067
- European history.
- Hmm.


552
00:41:41.154 --> 00:41:43.395
- Both parents alive?
- My mother.


553
00:41:43.489 --> 00:41:46.277
- Brothers, sisters?
- Two sisters, both in the Wrens.


554
00:41:46.367 --> 00:41:49.826
- What was the cause of your father's death?
- Same as mine.


555
00:41:49.912 --> 00:41:51.698
- Brain?
- No, war.


556
00:41:51.789 --> 00:41:53.200
- When?
- 1917.


557
00:41:54.292 --> 00:41:56.750
- You're, um, 29?
- Twenty-seven.


558
00:41:56.836 --> 00:41:58.292
- Called up?
- No, volunteered.


559
00:41:58.379 --> 00:42:00.495
- Trained in Canada, went on ops in '41.
- Bomber?


560
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.277
A spell of coastal, a spell of instructor.
Back to bombers, Lancasters.


561
00:42:03.301 --> 00:42:05.612
- You must have done a good many operations.
- Sixty-seven.


562
00:42:05.636 --> 00:42:08.845
I'm surprised they let you go back,
with your experience and seniority.


563
00:42:08.931 --> 00:42:10.421
With a new job - master bomber.

564
00:42:10.516 --> 00:42:12.223
- Tricky?
- Somebody's got to do it.


565
00:42:12.894 --> 00:42:13.894
Hmm.

566
00:42:16.689 --> 00:42:20.353
Now about these headaches.
When did they start?


567
00:42:20.443 --> 00:42:22.400
- Headaches?
- Oh, I know you get them.


568
00:42:22.487 --> 00:42:25.340
I know you've had them for some time,
and I know you've told nobody about them,


569
00:42:25.364 --> 00:42:26.946
especially your MO, right?

570
00:42:27.033 --> 00:42:29.821
- What else do you know?
- I know about your eyes.


571
00:42:30.411 --> 00:42:32.573
- You know a good deal.
- I'd like to know more.


572
00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:35.325
All right.

573
00:42:36.918 --> 00:42:38.374
Good.

574
00:42:38.461 --> 00:42:40.543
These headaches, when did this start?

575
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:42.246
- About six months ago.
- Bad?


576
00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:43.876
- Not at first.
- Where mostly?


577
00:42:44.592 --> 00:42:45.878
Here.

578
00:42:45.968 --> 00:42:47.925
Frontal and temporal.

579
00:42:48.012 --> 00:42:50.674
Did you ever have
a rather nasty bang on the head?


580
00:42:50.765 --> 00:42:52.802
- I don't think so.
- Sure?


581
00:42:52.892 --> 00:42:55.554
The usual one - dropped as a baby.

582
00:42:55.645 --> 00:42:59.013
- Does that support everything for you?
- Yes, I'm afraid it does.


583
00:42:59.107 --> 00:43:01.223
I'll see what I can cook up.

584
00:43:01.317 --> 00:43:04.025
- Do you mind if I try something?
- No, go ahead.


585
00:43:04.112 --> 00:43:07.571
Now, uh, just face this way. Don't move.

586
00:43:09.784 --> 00:43:12.367
Now, don't move your eyes.
Look straight ahead.


587
00:43:13.037 --> 00:43:14.778
- Check.
- What are you looking at?


588
00:43:14.872 --> 00:43:16.863
That girl with the
red hair and the legs.

589
00:43:16.958 --> 00:43:19.245
All right, I've got her.
Don't take your eyes off her.


590
00:43:19.335 --> 00:43:20.746
This is going to be easy.

591
00:43:20.837 --> 00:43:24.922
Now, without moving your eyes,
what can you see on the extreme right?


592
00:43:25.007 --> 00:43:26.088
Fireplace.

593
00:43:26.175 --> 00:43:27.665
- In the center?
- Girl.


594
00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.250
Extreme left?

595
00:43:31.305 --> 00:43:32.887
Windows.

596
00:43:32.974 --> 00:43:34.464
- Curtains?
- Yes.


597
00:43:34.559 --> 00:43:36.095
- Color?
- Red.


598
00:43:37.436 --> 00:43:38.972
All right, that will do.

599
00:43:39.063 --> 00:43:41.976
Well, if you're quite done staring
at that girl's legs, both of you.


600
00:43:42.066 --> 00:43:43.418
Well, you've got to do
what the doctor tells you.


601
00:43:43.442 --> 00:43:45.604
Confidentially,
they're rather knock-kneed.


602
00:43:50.408 --> 00:43:51.898
Hmm.

603
00:43:51.993 --> 00:43:53.984
- Now, any loss of appetite?
- No.


604
00:43:54.078 --> 00:43:55.568
- Nor of thirst?
- No fear.


605
00:43:55.663 --> 00:43:58.392
In fact, if anything, you've been eating
and drinking rather more than usual?


606
00:43:58.416 --> 00:44:00.096
You've just been looking at my mess bills.

607
00:44:00.877 --> 00:44:04.040
And you've seen something?

608
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:05.666
- Someone.
- Clearly?


609
00:44:05.756 --> 00:44:07.667
As clear as I see you.

610
00:44:07.758 --> 00:44:09.749
Have you had
a similar hallucination before?


611
00:44:09.844 --> 00:44:11.710
No, thanks.

612
00:44:11.804 --> 00:44:15.638
Tell me, do you believe in the survival
of human personality after death?


613
00:44:16.601 --> 00:44:18.717
I thought you said you read my verses?

614
00:44:19.645 --> 00:44:21.477
Do you?

615
00:44:21.564 --> 00:44:24.181
I don't know. I've never thought about it.
Do you?


616
00:44:25.193 --> 00:44:27.525
I don't know.
I've thought about it too much.


617
00:44:33.659 --> 00:44:36.026
- I thought I was asked to tea?
- It isn't time yet.


618
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.656
Past my time.

619
00:44:37.747 --> 00:44:40.239
One last question. 
It may sound silly.

620
00:44:40.333 --> 00:44:44.292
But, um, have you imagined recently
that you've smelled something


621
00:44:44.378 --> 00:44:47.461
that couldn't possibly be there?

622
00:44:47.548 --> 00:44:50.085
- What an extraordinary thing.
- What is?


623
00:44:50.176 --> 00:44:52.759
- How did you know?
- It was a long shot. You have?


624
00:44:53.304 --> 00:44:55.591
Yes, but it was so silly,
I would never have told you.


625
00:44:55.681 --> 00:44:59.219
It's important. It might explain everything
abnormal that you've seen and heard.


626
00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:00.596
Well, that would be a relief.

627
00:45:00.686 --> 00:45:03.373
But it still can't explain how I can jump
without a parachute and be alive.


628
00:45:03.397 --> 00:45:04.728
No, it couldn't do that,

629
00:45:04.815 --> 00:45:07.807
but there might be a possible explanation
even of that.


630
00:45:07.902 --> 00:45:11.270
Now, this heavenly messenger.
You saw him quite clearly?


631
00:45:11.364 --> 00:45:13.981
I told you, as
clear as I see you.

632
00:45:14.075 --> 00:45:16.692
And this smell you imagined,
was it at the same time?


633
00:45:16.786 --> 00:45:18.276
Yes, it was particularly strong.

634
00:45:18.371 --> 00:45:20.112
- Was it a pleasant smell?
- Yes.


635
00:45:20.206 --> 00:45:22.789
- Could you place it?
- Fried onions.


636
00:45:24.168 --> 00:45:26.956
And this messenger,
he hasn't turned up again?


637
00:45:27.046 --> 00:45:28.207
- No, but he will.
- When?


638
00:45:28.297 --> 00:45:30.208
He picks his own time and stops it.

639
00:45:30.299 --> 00:45:32.631
- Oh, Peter's lodged an appeal.
- Against what?


640
00:45:32.718 --> 00:45:35.585
- Against his call up.
- That's the spirit. Don't give in.


641
00:45:36.931 --> 00:45:38.012
I won't.

642
00:45:38.099 --> 00:45:40.511
I'm lucky that June knew you, Doctor.
Thank you for coming.


643
00:45:40.601 --> 00:45:42.387
June has lucky friends.

644
00:45:42.478 --> 00:45:44.719
- I've got bad news for you.
- Then why the grin?


645
00:45:44.814 --> 00:45:46.396
- You're going with me.
- Where to?


646
00:45:46.482 --> 00:45:47.972
To my house, for two reasons.

647
00:45:48.067 --> 00:45:50.729
First, I want to meet this chap
next time he drops in.


648
00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.686
Second,
I like a nice girl around the house,


649
00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:54.942
and she only comes to see me
to borrow a book.


650
00:45:55.032 --> 00:45:57.239
- And she's a slow reader.
- What about my CO?


651
00:45:57.326 --> 00:46:02.162
I fixed it with him. Besides,
until we get this settled, I am your CO.


652
00:46:02.248 --> 00:46:04.330
And at my house,
you get your tea at half past 4:00.


653
00:46:04.417 --> 00:46:06.954
- Tea breaks!
- All right!


654
00:46:07.044 --> 00:46:09.081
Here you get it at 5:00.

655
00:46:10.715 --> 00:46:12.501
Sinkers, Doc?

656
00:46:12.591 --> 00:46:14.332
Thank you.

657
00:46:14.427 --> 00:46:16.794
We are shaping, Frank. 
We are shaping.

658
00:46:42.913 --> 00:46:44.904
Ha-ha! 20-all!

659
00:46:53.674 --> 00:46:54.960
Ah!

660
00:46:55.051 --> 00:46:56.212
21-20. Sorry.

661
00:46:56.302 --> 00:46:58.669
- You're sorry, my foot. Ready?
- Ready.


662
00:47:02.391 --> 00:47:03.391
Nearly.

663
00:47:03.476 --> 00:47:05.763
Nearly doesn't count. 21-all.

664
00:47:07.229 --> 00:47:09.436
- Up!
- I'll be.


665
00:47:09.523 --> 00:47:10.684
Count ten.

666
00:47:10.775 --> 00:47:13.858
- I wonder if Peter's a good player.
- You can ask him when he wakes.


667
00:47:13.944 --> 00:47:15.944
Well, he's been asleep
nearly two hours and a half.


668
00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:17.591
- He'll wake at 11:00.
- How do you know?


669
00:47:17.615 --> 00:47:19.676
- I gave him a tablet.
- Well, how can you tell exactly?


670
00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.532
I can't tell exactly,
but I know the patient.


671
00:47:21.619 --> 00:47:23.109
- But do you know him?
- I think so.


672
00:47:23.204 --> 00:47:27.414
- Well, then tell me something about him.
- Are we playing table tennis, or are we not?


673
00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.366
- All right, your serve.
- Right. Ready?


674
00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:30.460
Ready.

675
00:47:31.212 --> 00:47:33.203
- Oh.
- Your game.


676
00:47:35.549 --> 00:47:37.290
Now tell me what you think about him.

677
00:47:37.385 --> 00:47:40.218
- I think he's fascinating.
- So do I.


678
00:47:40.304 --> 00:47:42.045
Not biologically. Medically.

679
00:47:42.139 --> 00:47:43.800
- Have a drink?
- Love one.


680
00:47:53.484 --> 00:47:55.896
What do the books say, Doc?

681
00:47:55.986 --> 00:47:58.353
I see a dark stranger in his life.

682
00:48:14.004 --> 00:48:16.666
Do you know what's wrong with him?

683
00:48:16.757 --> 00:48:18.839
Yes, I think I do.

684
00:48:18.926 --> 00:48:20.917
Is he going to be all right?

685
00:48:21.011 --> 00:48:23.002
He'll be all right. 
Here's your drink.

686
00:48:24.348 --> 00:48:26.806
Will he have any more hallucinations?

687
00:48:26.892 --> 00:48:28.724
- Yes.
- How do you know?


688
00:48:28.811 --> 00:48:31.473
Because this conductor
promised to come back.


689
00:48:31.564 --> 00:48:34.647
- Will that make him worse?
- Why should it?


690
00:48:34.733 --> 00:48:36.064
I don't know.

691
00:48:36.152 --> 00:48:40.521
Seeing things, arguing about his own life,
talking to a nonexistent man and -


692
00:48:40.614 --> 00:48:43.197
He does exist for him.

693
00:48:43.284 --> 00:48:46.151
He's not going mad then?
His brain isn't being affected?


694
00:48:46.245 --> 00:48:49.363
Of course it's being affected,
but not in the way you mean.


695
00:48:49.457 --> 00:48:51.539
That's why I asked him
about his sense of smell.


696
00:48:51.625 --> 00:48:53.115
I saw it was important.

697
00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:56.077
He's having a series
of highly organized hallucinations


698
00:48:56.172 --> 00:48:58.834
comparable to an experience
of actual life.


699
00:48:58.924 --> 00:49:02.462
A combination of vision,
of hearing, and of idea.


700
00:49:02.553 --> 00:49:04.965
To a neurologist,
that points to a direct connection


701
00:49:05.055 --> 00:49:07.046
with a sense of smell or of taste.

702
00:49:07.141 --> 00:49:10.384
Once that connection is established,
we know where to look for the trouble.


703
00:49:10.478 --> 00:49:12.970
I only want to find out one thing more
in his personal history,


704
00:49:13.063 --> 00:49:14.804
and I'll find that out later.

705
00:49:14.899 --> 00:49:16.105
<i>Now...</i>

706
00:49:18.527 --> 00:49:20.814
- I'm not going to tell you any more.
- Thanks.


707
00:49:22.114 --> 00:49:24.572
But how did he survive the jump?

708
00:49:24.658 --> 00:49:26.069
I don't know.

709
00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.743
If we could find that out and tell him,
it would save him.


710
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:32.572
It would help. But the main thing
is for him to win his case.


711
00:49:33.959 --> 00:49:35.950
- Are you serious?
- Perfectly serious.


712
00:49:36.045 --> 00:49:38.707
- We must help him to win it.
- How?


713
00:49:38.797 --> 00:49:41.710
It depends on what message
the conductor brings.


714
00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.713
But suppose he loses his case?

715
00:49:44.803 --> 00:49:46.339
Oh, that's absurd.

716
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:49.013
If we see that he's losing
or we think he's going to lose,


717
00:49:49.099 --> 00:49:51.261
we'll find out the reason why he survived.

718
00:49:51.352 --> 00:49:54.310
Or we'll invent one.
We'll have a couple of drinks, you and I.


719
00:49:54.396 --> 00:49:58.185
And we'll invent the greatest lie
in medical history.


720
00:49:58.275 --> 00:50:00.357
- Care for another game?
- I don't mind.


721
00:50:00.444 --> 00:50:02.481
Now, don't worry about him.
You see that bell?


722
00:50:02.571 --> 00:50:03.402
Yes.

723
00:50:03.489 --> 00:50:05.449
He's promised to ring it
if he gets another visit.


724
00:50:05.533 --> 00:50:07.524
- Fine.
- Come on, your serve.


725
00:50:16.627 --> 00:50:18.209
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.


726
00:50:27.012 --> 00:50:28.628
One-love. Come up.

727
00:51:00.212 --> 00:51:02.123
Doc, he's here! June!

728
00:51:09.221 --> 00:51:10.221
Doc!

729
00:51:48.802 --> 00:51:52.090
<i>Eh bien, mon chef,
comment ça va?</i>


730
00:51:52.181 --> 00:51:55.173
- Not too good.
- Hmm. Not too good, huh?


731
00:51:57.478 --> 00:52:00.812
I would not bother to ring that bell
if I were you. Nothing will happen.


732
00:52:00.898 --> 00:52:03.765
A little trick of mine, you remember?

733
00:52:03.859 --> 00:52:07.477
After all, what is time?

734
00:52:19.458 --> 00:52:21.790
Only, uh, tyranny.

735
00:52:23.295 --> 00:52:25.787
Let me know if you're going
to do that again, won't you?


736
00:52:25.881 --> 00:52:28.168
- This looks good.
- Very good. Do you know the author?


737
00:52:28.258 --> 00:52:31.296
- No, but I often have a game with Philidor.
- Philidor?


738
00:52:31.387 --> 00:52:33.107
The greatest master of chess
who ever lived.


739
00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:36.718
A Frenchman, nature/lament.
Come along and I'll introduce you.


740
00:52:36.809 --> 00:52:38.174
- Good.
- Splendid.


741
00:52:38.268 --> 00:52:40.475
No, I mean you've got
good news for me, my friend.


742
00:52:40.562 --> 00:52:41.848
How did you guess?

743
00:52:41.939 --> 00:52:43.917
Well, you wouldn't try to entice me
with this Philimor-


744
00:52:43.941 --> 00:52:44.772
Philidor.

745
00:52:44.858 --> 00:52:47.316
Philidor. If you had the right
to conduct me anyway.


746
00:52:47.403 --> 00:52:48.893
- True.
- Well?


747
00:52:48.987 --> 00:52:52.196
Speaking officially,
I have good news for you.


748
00:52:52.282 --> 00:52:53.282
Good.

749
00:52:53.367 --> 00:52:55.654
You are to be allowed to appeal
to the high court.


750
00:52:55.744 --> 00:52:56.575
Splendid.

751
00:52:56.662 --> 00:52:59.404
The trial will be a full-dress affair,
trés <i>chic,</i> in three days,


752
00:52:59.498 --> 00:53:01.239
to give you time to prepare your case.

753
00:53:01.333 --> 00:53:02.949
- Better and better.
- Hmm.


754
00:53:03.043 --> 00:53:05.910
- Do not be too pleased.
- Why? Is there a catch?


755
00:53:06.004 --> 00:53:07.836
The prosecuting counsel.

756
00:53:07.923 --> 00:53:11.917
Of course, I am not permitted to offer
advice or give a personal opinion, but-


757
00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:14.377
- Who is this prosecuting counsel?
- Be prepared.


758
00:53:14.471 --> 00:53:15.677
- For what?
- A shock.


759
00:53:15.764 --> 00:53:17.755
Well, come on.
Tell me the worst. Who is it?


760
00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:19.557
Abraham Farlan.

761
00:53:19.643 --> 00:53:21.509
- Come again?
- Abraham Farlan!


762
00:53:21.603 --> 00:53:23.139
- Well, I never heard of him.
- No?


763
00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:25.437
- Never in my life.
- He lives in Boston.


764
00:53:25.524 --> 00:53:27.515
- I've never been in Boston.
Massachusetts?


765
00:53:27.609 --> 00:53:29.099
I'd never been there.

766
00:53:29.194 --> 00:53:33.279
Abraham Farlan died in Boston in 1775.

767
00:53:33.365 --> 00:53:35.823
Does that date convey anything to you?

768
00:53:35.909 --> 00:53:38.822
- Lexington, Concord?
- Exactly. You are good at history.


769
00:53:38.912 --> 00:53:40.698
The American war of independence.

770
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:43.998
- Oh, he was killed?
- By a British bullet.


771
00:53:44.084 --> 00:53:46.496
Oh. He might be, uh, prejudiced.

772
00:53:46.587 --> 00:53:49.170
Hmm. He hates your guts.

773
00:53:49.256 --> 00:53:52.123
And he hates the guts of every Englishman.

774
00:53:52.217 --> 00:53:56.176
And particularly, he hates
this little affair with a Boston-born girl.


775
00:53:56.263 --> 00:53:57.753
It's not a little affair.

776
00:53:57.848 --> 00:54:01.057
A big affair.
He will hate you even more.


777
00:54:01.143 --> 00:54:03.371
- All right, I'll appeal against it.
- It will be no good.


778
00:54:03.395 --> 00:54:06.808
After all, we had to choose a good man.
The honor of the department was at stake.


779
00:54:06.899 --> 00:54:10.017
No, what you have to do
is to choose a good man for yourself.


780
00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:11.817
- As defending counsel?
- Precisely.


781
00:54:11.904 --> 00:54:14.236
- Can I choose anybody?
- Anybody in the other world.


782
00:54:14.323 --> 00:54:16.360
Anybody who has ever lived upon Earth.

783
00:54:16.450 --> 00:54:18.737
Everybody is at your disposal.

784
00:54:18.827 --> 00:54:20.443
You can choose me.

785
00:54:20.537 --> 00:54:22.869
- That would suit your book.
- But do not waste any time.


786
00:54:22.956 --> 00:54:25.618
Abraham Farlan
is piling up his case already.


787
00:54:25.709 --> 00:54:28.451
You can choose Socrates.
You can choose William Pitt.


788
00:54:28.545 --> 00:54:30.161
You can choose Henry VIII.

789
00:54:30.255 --> 00:54:34.670
Oh. Madame du Barry.
She knows all about love.


790
00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.548
- Rather a one-track mind.
- You are a good chess player.


791
00:54:37.638 --> 00:54:38.844
Philidor.

792
00:54:38.931 --> 00:54:40.467
I'll think it over.

793
00:54:40.557 --> 00:54:43.595
By the way, I'd like to borrow this.

794
00:54:43.685 --> 00:54:46.473
- It's not mine. It belongs to the doctor.
- Oh, doctors.


795
00:54:46.563 --> 00:54:47.644
What about them?

796
00:54:47.731 --> 00:54:50.564
They give me a great deal
of trouble in my job.


797
00:54:57.407 --> 00:55:01.241
- He was here. He tricked us.
- Yes, he was... here.


798
00:55:03.372 --> 00:55:05.454
And these were on the floor.

799
00:55:05.541 --> 00:55:07.498
Peter, sit down.

800
00:55:11.713 --> 00:55:14.080
Now, look up.

801
00:55:15.092 --> 00:55:17.675
Yeah. You've been doing some hard talking.

802
00:55:17.761 --> 00:55:20.298
- I have.
- I hope you didn't give into anything.


803
00:55:20.389 --> 00:55:22.005
- No.
- That's the spirit.


804
00:55:22.099 --> 00:55:25.262
- Do you think I could stay overnight, Frank?
- Yes, I'll tell Mrs. Tucker.


805
00:55:25.352 --> 00:55:27.889
- I don't need anything much.
- Now, let's see.


806
00:55:30.607 --> 00:55:33.065
Hmm. I'll tell Mrs. 
Tucker you're staying.

807
00:55:33.151 --> 00:55:34.357
- Dr. Reeves?
- Yes?


808
00:55:34.444 --> 00:55:36.902
Can I stay in here?
I want to be near these books.


809
00:55:36.989 --> 00:55:39.401
Of course. I'll fix up a camp bed.

810
00:55:40.826 --> 00:55:42.692
- Great news, darling.
- What, sweet?


811
00:55:42.786 --> 00:55:44.902
- I'm to be allowed to appeal.
- Really?


812
00:55:44.997 --> 00:55:46.988
Oh, June, I don't want to leave you.

813
00:55:47.082 --> 00:55:50.746
Darling, why should you leave me?
Everything will be all right.


814
00:55:50.836 --> 00:55:53.498
- Well, if I can get a good counsel.
- Of course you will.


815
00:55:53.589 --> 00:55:56.502
It's very important.
I - I don't want to lose you.


816
00:55:56.592 --> 00:55:58.959
Darling, I don't intend to let you go.

817
00:55:59.052 --> 00:56:01.134
No one can take you from me.
I won't let them.


818
00:56:01.221 --> 00:56:02.221
It's no good, you see?

819
00:56:02.306 --> 00:56:05.159
A judgment against me will be backed up
by all of the power of this world


820
00:56:05.183 --> 00:56:06.844
and of the other.

821
00:56:08.353 --> 00:56:09.843
Drink this.

822
00:56:10.898 --> 00:56:13.230
- Peter's got the right to appeal.
- Splendid.


823
00:56:13.317 --> 00:56:14.978
- Did you smell anything?
- Yes.


824
00:56:15.068 --> 00:56:16.479
- The same? Fried onions?
- Yes.


825
00:56:16.570 --> 00:56:18.857
Good. Drink that up.

826
00:56:18.947 --> 00:56:20.483
- Any headache?
- Hmm.


827
00:56:21.408 --> 00:56:24.400
- You can tell me tomorrow what he said.
- No. He said -


828
00:56:25.954 --> 00:56:27.661
- Good heavens.
- What is it?


829
00:56:27.748 --> 00:56:29.739
<i>- He's got my Hundred Best Games.</i>
- What?


830
00:56:29.833 --> 00:56:32.416
Alekhine's chess book, Hundred Best <i>Games.</i>
Are you sure?


831
00:56:32.502 --> 00:56:34.834
Absolutely certain. He had it in his hand.
What a nerve.


832
00:56:34.922 --> 00:56:37.414
A bit cold. Now,
how about getting to bed?

833
00:56:37.507 --> 00:56:39.068
I want to talk to you first.
It's important.


834
00:56:39.092 --> 00:56:42.585
No, not now. Have a long sleep.
Tomorrow you'll feel as fresh as a daisy.


835
00:56:42.679 --> 00:56:45.440
It's about my counsel. I don't think
you believe a word of what I say.


836
00:56:45.515 --> 00:56:46.721
Of course we do.

837
00:56:46.808 --> 00:56:50.176
My dear friend, here on Earth,
I am your defending counsel,


838
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:53.479
and as your counsel,
I believe everything you tell me.


839
00:57:03.158 --> 00:57:04.740
Uh, hello, Dr. Gaertler.

840
00:57:04.826 --> 00:57:07.409
Why, hello, Dr. Reeves.
You make your rounds the hard way.


841
00:57:07.496 --> 00:57:09.487
- Give me a coupe anytime.
- Is Dr. McEwen free?


842
00:57:09.581 --> 00:57:10.992
- He's just going to operate.
- Oh.


843
00:57:11.083 --> 00:57:14.062
He hasn't started yet. I'll tell him.
I imagine he'll see you in the washroom.


844
00:57:14.086 --> 00:57:15.451
Thanks.

845
00:57:40.445 --> 00:57:42.937
- Hello, Frank. What's new?
- Deterioration all around.


846
00:57:43.031 --> 00:57:45.648
- We ought to operate tonight.
- That's impossible. We're swamped.


847
00:57:45.742 --> 00:57:48.702
- Are you sure of your diagnosis?
- Certain. I discovered the missing fact.


848
00:57:48.745 --> 00:57:51.407
He had slight concussion two years ago
with no aftereffects.


849
00:57:51.498 --> 00:57:54.160
The X-ray is inconclusive.
You'll see in the ocular reports.


850
00:57:54.251 --> 00:57:56.538
You know all about these
highly organized hallucinations


851
00:57:56.628 --> 00:57:58.210
coupled with a sense of smell.

852
00:57:58.296 --> 00:58:02.164
Everything points to arachnoid adhesions
involving the olfactory nerve in the brain.


853
00:58:02.259 --> 00:58:04.341
It's a tricky operation,
but I've never seen one.


854
00:58:04.428 --> 00:58:07.420
I have. Several
at the Hospital de la Pitié in Paris.


855
00:58:07.514 --> 00:58:09.826
I've made some notes, so I wonder
if the surgeon could see them.


856
00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:12.512
Sure. It'll be Dr. Liza.
He's a very fine neurosurgeon.


857
00:58:12.602 --> 00:58:16.061
- Liza. A good man.
- I don't see how we can manage tonight.


858
00:58:16.148 --> 00:58:18.606
There's no crisis in such a thing.
Any day will do.


859
00:58:18.692 --> 00:58:20.103
No, it won't.

860
00:58:20.193 --> 00:58:23.026
And I'll tell you why I think it won't
and why there is a crisis.


861
00:58:23.113 --> 00:58:25.525
I'm afraid of his brain
being permanently affected.


862
00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:27.906
- Insanity?
- Yes.


863
00:58:27.993 --> 00:58:28.993
Why?

864
00:58:29.036 --> 00:58:33.280
Because his trial is fixed for tonight and
he hasn't found anyone to defend him yet.


865
00:58:33.373 --> 00:58:36.206
He spends all his time in my library
or in talks with me and the girl.


866
00:58:36.293 --> 00:58:38.409
He only sleeps when I drug him.

867
00:58:38.503 --> 00:58:41.086
The boy has a fine mind,
but it's a little taxed.


868
00:58:41.173 --> 00:58:43.631
That's the trouble. 
It's too good a mind.

869
00:58:43.717 --> 00:58:46.084
A weak mind isn't strong enough
to hurt itself.


870
00:58:46.178 --> 00:58:48.715
Stupidity has saved many a man
from going mad.


871
00:58:48.805 --> 00:58:50.170
Yes, you're right there.

872
00:58:50.265 --> 00:58:53.929
And he's had several talks
with this heavenly messenger.


873
00:58:54.019 --> 00:58:57.887
Hallucinations, of course,
but you never saw such an imagination.


874
00:58:57.981 --> 00:59:02.270
I've been taking tips on the otherworld -
laws, system, architecture.


875
00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.566
Here's the interesting point.

876
00:59:03.653 --> 00:59:05.940
He never steps outside the limits
of his own imagination.


877
00:59:06.031 --> 00:59:09.490
- I don't quite get you.
- Nothing he invents is entirely fantastic.


878
00:59:09.576 --> 00:59:12.284
It's invention, but logical invention.

879
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:16.455
And the keystone to his invention
is that the trial takes place tonight.


880
00:59:16.541 --> 00:59:19.124
He must win or lose his case tonight,

881
00:59:19.211 --> 00:59:21.211
and that's why I think
we ought to operate tonight.


882
00:59:21.296 --> 00:59:24.317
It's no use shaking your head, and that's
why I think we ought to find a counsel


883
00:59:24.341 --> 00:59:27.003
to save him from losing his case,
or we may lose him.


884
00:59:45.987 --> 00:59:49.525
What about... him?

885
00:59:51.243 --> 00:59:55.282
Lincoln?
No, it's hardly fair to drag him in.


886
00:59:55.372 --> 00:59:56.988
I don't believe he'd be prejudiced.

887
00:59:59.751 --> 01:00:01.037
Plato.

888
01:00:02.671 --> 01:00:04.537
How would you like
to be defended by Plato?


889
01:00:04.631 --> 01:00:07.464
Nobody knew more
about reasoning than Plato.


890
01:00:07.551 --> 01:00:10.714
He was 81 when he died. He might be
too old to think love important.


891
01:00:10.804 --> 01:00:12.260
You think so?

892
01:00:12.347 --> 01:00:15.214
Anyhow, Plato had
very elementary ideas about love.


893
01:00:17.269 --> 01:00:18.851
Besides, didn't he quote Sophocles

894
01:00:18.937 --> 01:00:21.577
when somebody asked him
if he was still able to appreciate a woman?


895
01:00:21.648 --> 01:00:22.979
What did the old boy say?

896
01:00:23.066 --> 01:00:26.275
Well, he said, uh, “I'm only too
glad to be rid of all of that.


897
01:00:26.361 --> 01:00:28.693
It's like escaping from bondage
to a raving madman.”


898
01:00:30.031 --> 01:00:32.773
These Greeks - cold as their marble.

899
01:00:32.868 --> 01:00:34.358
Now, if he had been French.

900
01:00:34.452 --> 01:00:37.786
Richelieu, for example.
Irresistible at 80.


901
01:00:37.873 --> 01:00:40.160
How about Richelieu?

902
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:42.617
I never liked him much
since The Three Musketeers.


903
01:00:53.054 --> 01:00:55.386
Solomon.

904
01:00:55.473 --> 01:00:57.589
Solomon.

905
01:00:58.226 --> 01:00:59.682
No?

906
01:00:59.769 --> 01:01:02.101
<i>Mais, tonnerre de Dieu, who do you want'?</i>

907
01:01:02.189 --> 01:01:03.725
You have only a few hours left.

908
01:01:03.815 --> 01:01:07.900
Look, it sounds a grand idea to have
all these great men to choose from,


909
01:01:07.986 --> 01:01:11.069
but what did they know
of our problems today?


910
01:01:11.156 --> 01:01:12.863
True. Very little.

911
01:01:12.949 --> 01:01:15.190
Besides, I think it ought
to be an Englishman.


912
01:01:16.161 --> 01:01:20.576
Nobody famous, but somebody
with his head screwed on all right.


913
01:01:21.458 --> 01:01:23.165
Screwed?

914
01:01:23.251 --> 01:01:25.117
Now, this Abraham, um -

915
01:01:25.212 --> 01:01:27.704
- Farlan.
- Farlan. Was he a famous man?


916
01:01:27.797 --> 01:01:30.289
He was the first American
to be killed by a British bullet.


917
01:01:30.383 --> 01:01:33.183
No. I don't mean that. I mean, was he
a great philosopher or statesman?


918
01:01:33.261 --> 01:01:36.504
- He was a schoolteacher.
- There, you see.


919
01:01:36.598 --> 01:01:42.344
Now, Plato would probably talk
about perceptions and causations.


920
01:01:42.437 --> 01:01:43.472
Pardon?

921
01:01:44.231 --> 01:01:46.393
- Over your head too?
- Definitely.


922
01:01:46.483 --> 01:01:48.474
Well, it's quite simple.

923
01:01:51.696 --> 01:01:56.406
By the way, why are you so interested
in my winning my case?


924
01:01:56.493 --> 01:01:57.608
L'.>

925
01:01:57.702 --> 01:01:59.113
Yes, you.

926
01:02:07.337 --> 01:02:09.624
And why am I
being taken up this stairway?

927
01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.922
I'm not being taken for a ride,
am I, by any chance?


928
01:02:16.012 --> 01:02:18.879
- What a suggestion.
- Take that bit of barley sugar away.


929
01:02:18.974 --> 01:02:20.974
I don't like it,
and I don't like your suggestions.


930
01:02:21.017 --> 01:02:22.928
I think I'll go
back before it's too late.

931
01:02:23.019 --> 01:02:25.260
Peter. Peter!

932
01:02:25.355 --> 01:02:27.096
Peter!

933
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:28.646
Peter.

934
01:02:28.733 --> 01:02:32.271
<i>Peter, ne soyez pas béte! Peter!</i>

935
01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:37.402
Peter, come back.

936
01:02:38.159 --> 01:02:41.368
Peter. Peter, come back!

937
01:02:41.454 --> 01:02:42.819
Peter.

938
01:02:42.914 --> 01:02:44.746
Peter, come back!

939
01:02:46.376 --> 01:02:47.707
Peter!

940
01:02:47.794 --> 01:02:49.785
Peter, come back!

941
01:02:50.547 --> 01:02:52.584
Peter, come back!

942
01:02:53.675 --> 01:02:56.713
Peter! Peter, come back!

943
01:02:58.430 --> 01:03:01.718
Peter! Peter, come back!

944
01:03:02.767 --> 01:03:05.179
Peter! Peter, come back!

945
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:06.977
Peter! Peter!

946
01:03:07.981 --> 01:03:10.063
Peter, my darling, come back to me.

947
01:03:18.033 --> 01:03:19.944
He almost got me.

948
01:03:49.814 --> 01:03:52.397
He'll be all right in a moment.
Why isn't the ambulance here?


949
01:03:52.484 --> 01:03:53.974
It was due half an hour ago.

950
01:03:54.069 --> 01:03:56.857
Go and phone Dr. McEwen.
Tell him we must operate tonight.


951
01:03:56.946 --> 01:03:59.028
It's life or death.
And tell him about the ambulance.


952
01:03:59.115 --> 01:04:00.196
Yes, Doctor.

953
01:04:00.283 --> 01:04:02.490
Send a telegram to his mother.
He's got two sisters too.


954
01:04:02.577 --> 01:04:04.284
- Yes, Doctor.
- That's all.


955
01:04:08.458 --> 01:04:10.369
- Now, Peter-
- Where's June?


956
01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.076
Phoning. Back in a moment.

957
01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:14.002
- He almost got me.
- I know.


958
01:04:14.089 --> 01:04:16.672
He's a crafty beggar.
I only got away by the skin of my teeth.


959
01:04:16.758 --> 01:04:19.796
Now look here, don't let anybody
fool you into giving up this case.


960
01:04:19.886 --> 01:04:22.323
You've been allowed to appeal.
You've been promised a fair trial.


961
01:04:22.347 --> 01:04:25.339
- Don't give in to anybody. Promise?
- I've got no counsel.


962
01:04:25.433 --> 01:04:28.425
We'll find the right man. They can't
start your trial without your counsel.


963
01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.727
- They might appoint some stooge.
- Nonsense.


964
01:04:30.814 --> 01:04:33.431
- Or let it go by default.
- I tell you, we'll find somebody.


965
01:04:33.525 --> 01:04:35.482
They can't start till then.

966
01:04:35.568 --> 01:04:37.400
Nobody famous.

967
01:04:37.487 --> 01:04:39.694
No, that would be
the worst thing we could do.


968
01:04:39.781 --> 01:04:42.239
- How about a pal of yours?
- We might find somebody.


969
01:04:42.325 --> 01:04:44.066
What about your radio operator?

970
01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.901
- Bob?
- Yes, think it over.


971
01:04:47.372 --> 01:04:49.058
- You couldn't get through?
- They don't answer.


972
01:04:49.082 --> 01:04:51.394
It's the storm, Mr. Frank.
They always cut the telephone off.


973
01:04:51.418 --> 01:04:53.409
- I'll go on my bike.
- No, one of us must go.


974
01:04:53.503 --> 01:04:55.460
Look, you're more valuable here.

975
01:04:55.547 --> 01:04:58.209
Now, if the ambulance comes,
don't wait for me.


976
01:04:58.299 --> 01:05:00.757
And if I meet it, I'll come back.
Now, go to him.


977
01:05:00.844 --> 01:05:03.927
Don't allow him to despair.
His life is in your hands.


978
01:05:31.458 --> 01:05:33.825
- Where's Frank?
- He won't be long, darling.


979
01:05:34.461 --> 01:05:36.452
I must talk to him.

980
01:05:36.546 --> 01:05:40.756
- I don't think Bob's the right man.
<i>- I'll</i> tell him you said so.


981
01:05:40.842 --> 01:05:42.332
- Do you know Bob?
- No.


982
01:05:43.011 --> 01:05:45.799
He was my sparks.

983
01:05:45.889 --> 01:05:47.425
Highly operational type.

984
01:05:47.515 --> 01:05:49.005
We'll find somebody.

985
01:05:51.186 --> 01:05:52.893
Time's nearly up.

986
01:05:52.979 --> 01:05:56.062
- Frank will come up with something.
- I wish he'd hurry.


987
01:06:04.115 --> 01:06:05.150
Look out!

988
01:06:14.584 --> 01:06:16.541
Dr. Reeves!

989
01:06:21.841 --> 01:06:23.548
- Get the fire extinguishers!
- Okay, sir!


990
01:06:23.635 --> 01:06:25.125
- And the blankets!
- Right!


991
01:06:33.937 --> 01:06:35.769
- Can I help you, sir?
- Watch the road.


992
01:07:04.008 --> 01:07:06.625
He never saw us
until it was too late.

993
01:07:06.719 --> 01:07:08.801
He turned off to save us.

994
01:07:09.556 --> 01:07:12.173
Gosh, I feel bad about it.
He was a fine man.


995
01:07:12.267 --> 01:07:14.429
You couldn't help it.

996
01:07:14.519 --> 01:07:16.635
He was interested in this case, wasn't he?

997
01:07:17.814 --> 01:07:20.977
- Yes.
- I saw his notes he left for Dr. Liza.


998
01:07:21.067 --> 01:07:23.104
It was a fine piece of diagnosis.

999
01:07:23.194 --> 01:07:25.401
He left notes for the operation too.

1000
01:07:25.488 --> 01:07:28.105
- Dr. Liza is very good, isn't he?
- The best.


1001
01:07:32.370 --> 01:07:33.531
Frank?

1002
01:07:35.957 --> 01:07:37.038
I'm here, darling.

1003
01:07:39.043 --> 01:07:40.043
Where's Frank?

1004
01:07:43.881 --> 01:07:45.371
He's gone ahead.

1005
01:07:50.513 --> 01:07:52.595
He's had an accident.

1006
01:07:56.561 --> 01:07:58.177
Hasn't he?

1007
01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:03.228
Yes, a bad accident.

1008
01:08:08.531 --> 01:08:09.942
Is he dead?

1009
01:08:12.493 --> 01:08:14.200
Yes, he's dead.

1010
01:08:31.554 --> 01:08:33.545
All right, boys. Step lively.

1011
01:08:35.933 --> 01:08:38.140
Okay, Doc. His hand.

1012
01:08:38.895 --> 01:08:40.977
- Easy.
- All right.


1013
01:08:41.064 --> 01:08:42.896
Easy down there.

1014
01:08:47.028 --> 01:08:49.190
- All right, Johnny. Take it away.
- Okay.


1015
01:09:24.232 --> 01:09:26.564
- An atropine injection, Sister?
- Yes, a hundredth.


1016
01:09:26.651 --> 01:09:29.268
- Is this the cranial case?
- Yes, that's right.


1017
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:34.193
Hello, Squadron Leader.
We're all ready for you.


1018
01:11:18.012 --> 01:11:19.673
- Dr. Reeves?
- Yes.


1019
01:11:19.764 --> 01:11:22.301
Permit me to return your book.

1020
01:11:22.391 --> 01:11:23.802
- Oh-ho!
- Aha!


1021
01:11:23.893 --> 01:11:27.056
- So, it's you?
- I will introduce you to Philidor.


1022
01:11:27.146 --> 01:11:29.934
Cher colllégue,
this is a special case. Court of Appeal.


1023
01:11:30.024 --> 01:11:33.358
- I will undertake to deliver Dr. Reeves.
- As you wish.


1024
01:11:34.237 --> 01:11:35.648
<i>Merci.</i>

1025
01:11:38.658 --> 01:11:40.820
- Be of good cheer, friend.
- Thank you.


1026
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:43.242
One of the best men in the service,
a compatriot of yours.


1027
01:11:43.329 --> 01:11:44.911
- What's his name?
- Oh, John -


1028
01:11:44.997 --> 01:11:46.487
Bunyan. Yes, of course.

1029
01:11:46.582 --> 01:11:49.745
And how is dear Peter?

1030
01:11:49.836 --> 01:11:52.624
Oh, he has a fighting chance.

1031
01:11:52.713 --> 01:11:54.203
Oh-ho.

1032
01:12:01.597 --> 01:12:03.679
- Dr. Frank Reeves?
- Yes.


1033
01:12:04.392 --> 01:12:06.633
You're familiar with the case
of Squadron Leader Carter?


1034
01:12:06.727 --> 01:12:08.343
Lam.

1035
01:12:08.437 --> 01:12:12.806
- He has chosen you to be his counsel.
- I hoped he would.


1036
01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:14.641
- Do you accept?
- I do.


1037
01:12:14.735 --> 01:12:17.443
You have very little time
in which to prepare your case.


1038
01:12:18.197 --> 01:12:20.188
What facilities do you wish?

1039
01:12:20.283 --> 01:12:23.275
I should like to see my client
and get his instructions.


1040
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:26.282
And I subpoena
Flying Officer Trubshawe as a witness.


1041
01:12:26.372 --> 01:12:29.285
Certainly. Conductor 71.

1042
01:12:29.375 --> 01:12:32.618
You will take Dr. Frank Reeves
to Squadron Leader Carter.


1043
01:12:58.321 --> 01:13:01.154
Psst. Peter. Peter.

1044
01:13:29.727 --> 01:13:31.559
- Hello, Bob.
- What ho, Skipper.


1045
01:13:31.646 --> 01:13:33.887
I didn't expect to see you here.
Not yet anyway.


1046
01:13:33.981 --> 01:13:35.688
Not up there either.

1047
01:13:35.775 --> 01:13:38.608
- Well, it was Doc Reeves' idea.
- I subpoenaed him. Let's talk.


1048
01:13:38.694 --> 01:13:40.059
Right.

1049
01:13:40.154 --> 01:13:43.522
- You sure they won't miss me?
- Miss you? You know me, man <i>ami.</i>


1050
01:13:44.867 --> 01:13:47.780
That surgeon's very neat.
Very neat indeed.


1051
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:50.111
I like his work.
You're in good hands, Peter.


1052
01:13:50.206 --> 01:13:51.367
I know.

1053
01:13:51.457 --> 01:13:53.243
- Now, look here.
- I know what's coming.


1054
01:13:53.334 --> 01:13:55.792
Yes, I'm very flattered,
but are you sure I'm the best man?


1055
01:13:55.878 --> 01:13:56.709
Quite sure.

1056
01:13:56.796 --> 01:13:59.024
Aren't you afraid that I may be
out of my depths up there?


1057
01:13:59.048 --> 01:13:59.879
No.

1058
01:13:59.966 --> 01:14:01.886
- Well, doesn't it worry you I'm no lawyer?
- No.


1059
01:14:01.926 --> 01:14:03.963
- If he gets onto politics, I'm sunk.
- Who isn't?


1060
01:14:04.053 --> 01:14:07.216
- Come on, Frank. You must have something.
- Oh, just a little common sense.


1061
01:14:07.306 --> 01:14:09.843
And if it's as rare up there
as it is down here, it'll do me.


1062
01:14:09.934 --> 01:14:11.140
- Say yes.
- Well -


1063
01:14:11.227 --> 01:14:13.935
- He has no choice anyhow.
- What are we talking about then?


1064
01:14:14.021 --> 01:14:16.433
All right. I need evidence.

1065
01:14:22.488 --> 01:14:24.070
Look at her.

1066
01:14:25.366 --> 01:14:26.572
Holy smoke!

1067
01:14:26.659 --> 01:14:27.945
Well -

1068
01:14:28.035 --> 01:14:31.198
- She looks like a nice girl.
- She is a nice girl.


1069
01:14:31.288 --> 01:14:33.404
Hardly your type, Skip.

1070
01:14:33.499 --> 01:14:35.831
I've fallen in love with her.

1071
01:14:35.918 --> 01:14:39.912
Her accent is foreign,
but it sounds sweet to me.


1072
01:14:41.674 --> 01:14:46.089
We were born thousands of miles apart...
but we were made for each other.


1073
01:14:46.178 --> 01:14:47.794
That's an excellent piece of prose.

1074
01:14:50.016 --> 01:14:52.849
- Sorry.
- Nothing to be ashamed of.


1075
01:14:53.728 --> 01:14:55.560
May I kiss her,
just in case, you know?

1076
01:14:55.646 --> 01:14:57.887
Okay, you may, but
she will not know it.

1077
01:14:58.441 --> 01:15:00.148
It doesn't matter.

1078
01:15:01.610 --> 01:15:03.100
Oh, he's English.

1079
01:15:03.195 --> 01:15:06.438
What is the good of kissing a girl
if she does not feel it?


1080
01:15:16.208 --> 01:15:17.664
- Look.
- What?


1081
01:15:17.752 --> 01:15:20.039
The evidence you wanted.

1082
01:15:20.129 --> 01:15:21.836
Her tears.

1083
01:15:23.632 --> 01:15:25.543
Oh, I wish I
could take one with me.

1084
01:15:25.634 --> 01:15:28.046
You are counsel. 
You can do as you wish.

1085
01:15:28.137 --> 01:15:31.175
I say, why don't we wrap it up
and take it with us?


1086
01:15:32.183 --> 01:15:33.765
Permit me.

1087
01:15:42.318 --> 01:15:45.185
That's it.
The only real bit of evidence we have.


1088
01:15:46.238 --> 01:15:49.526
Quick. We must not keep the court waiting.

1089
01:18:18.224 --> 01:18:20.591
The court of appeal sits
to consider the case


1090
01:18:20.684 --> 01:18:22.300
<i>of the Department of Records</i>

1091
01:18:22.394 --> 01:18:26.262
<i>versus Squadron Leader Peter David Carter
of the Royal Air Force.</i>


1092
01:18:27.149 --> 01:18:29.015
He claims negligence

1093
01:18:29.109 --> 01:18:32.602
and superior rights and responsibilities
arising out of that negligence.


1094
01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:37.528
He is appealing for remission
of the date of his term on Earth


1095
01:18:37.618 --> 01:18:40.110
and for a reconsideration of his case.

1096
01:18:40.955 --> 01:18:43.367
It has been decided to allow this appeal.

1097
01:18:43.999 --> 01:18:46.491
It is for the jury to decide
whether it shall be successful.


1098
01:18:48.671 --> 01:18:50.833
Owing to the Interest aroused by the case,

1099
01:18:50.923 --> 01:18:53.540
there is an unusually large audience.

1100
01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:57.173
We can, of course, seat everyone
who wishes to be present,


1101
01:18:58.055 --> 01:19:01.798
but the front rows have been reserved for those
who have a special interest in the case.


1102
01:19:02.685 --> 01:19:05.017
Members of the jury,

1103
01:19:05.104 --> 01:19:09.223
do not allow yourselves to be influenced
by anything but the facts


1104
01:19:09.316 --> 01:19:10.898
and by your conscience.

1105
01:19:11.777 --> 01:19:15.441
You will have every assistance from the court
to help you to arrive at your verdict.


1106
01:19:17.783 --> 01:19:20.275
The counsel for the prosecution
will take his place.


1107
01:19:46.937 --> 01:19:49.304
The counsel for the defense
will take his place.


1108
01:19:58.574 --> 01:20:01.236
I call upon the prosecution
to open the case.


1109
01:20:06.081 --> 01:20:09.290
Your Honor, members of the jury,

1110
01:20:09.376 --> 01:20:11.834
this case has three issues.

1111
01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:15.003
Peter D. Carter, an Englishman,

1112
01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:18.799
should have died
on the second day of May, 1945,


1113
01:20:18.886 --> 01:20:21.253
at ten after 4:00 of the clock.

1114
01:20:21.347 --> 01:20:23.964
British double summertime.

1115
01:20:24.058 --> 01:20:29.303
Due to an oversight, which I hasten to state is
contrary to the traditions of a great service...


1116
01:20:31.315 --> 01:20:33.602
the defendant did not die.

1117
01:20:33.692 --> 01:20:37.731
Therefore, issue number one,
who is responsible?


1118
01:20:37.821 --> 01:20:40.483
When summoned to report
some 20-odd hours later,


1119
01:20:40.574 --> 01:20:43.487
the defendant refused
to accompany Conductor 71,


1120
01:20:43.577 --> 01:20:47.741
giving, as his reason,
that in the time, which he had borrowed,


1121
01:20:47.831 --> 01:20:49.788
he had accumulated new responsibilities

1122
01:20:49.875 --> 01:20:53.413
of an allegedly important
and permanent nature.


1123
01:20:53.504 --> 01:20:57.998
He claimed, in fact,
that in these 20 hours,


1124
01:20:58.092 --> 01:21:02.837
a young lady of good American stock
had fallen in love with him.


1125
01:21:03.972 --> 01:21:06.634
Therefore, issue number two,

1126
01:21:06.725 --> 01:21:08.932
are we to believe this?

1127
01:21:09.019 --> 01:21:13.229
Furthermore, he states that
in these 20 hours, which he had borrowed -


1128
01:21:13.315 --> 01:21:18.310
My lord, I object to the word “borrowed,”
which counsel is using so emphatically.


1129
01:21:18.404 --> 01:21:20.941
To borrow means
to get temporary use of something,


1130
01:21:21.031 --> 01:21:22.897
to use something
without being the true owner.


1131
01:21:22.991 --> 01:21:25.198
My client didn't get.

1132
01:21:25.285 --> 01:21:27.822
He was given the 20 hours in question.

1133
01:21:27.913 --> 01:21:30.621
He didn't use something
without being the true owner.


1134
01:21:30.707 --> 01:21:32.573
He was the true
owner of his own life.

1135
01:21:34.211 --> 01:21:37.670
The next points are,
is this young Englishman in love


1136
01:21:37.756 --> 01:21:40.544
with this young lady
of good American stock?


1137
01:21:40.634 --> 01:21:43.843
And even more important this,
is she in love with him?


1138
01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:46.421
Why do you stress their nationalities?

1139
01:21:46.515 --> 01:21:49.177
Very important, sir. 
Extremely important.

1140
01:21:49.268 --> 01:21:52.556
- Why?
- Because we are talking of love, sir.


1141
01:21:52.646 --> 01:21:55.809
It can happen, you know, between
an Englishman and an American girl.


1142
01:21:55.899 --> 01:21:58.311
And, uh, vice versa.

1143
01:21:58.402 --> 01:22:00.393
Possibly.

1144
01:22:00.487 --> 01:22:03.775
But what are these love affairs,
Dr. Reeves?


1145
01:22:03.866 --> 01:22:06.984
Men and women,
thousands of miles away from home,


1146
01:22:07.077 --> 01:22:10.195
away from the love they left behind.

1147
01:22:10.289 --> 01:22:13.202
Minute sparks instead of scorching flames.

1148
01:22:14.251 --> 01:22:18.085
Fading shabby wigs
instead of the rich gold of a woman's hair.


1149
01:22:19.089 --> 01:22:21.797
The love of the moment, Dr. Reeves.

1150
01:22:21.884 --> 01:22:24.125
Do I call it love?

1151
01:22:24.219 --> 01:22:26.176
Once in a thousand times, perhaps.

1152
01:22:26.889 --> 01:22:29.551
And how many end in lasting marriage?

1153
01:22:29.641 --> 01:22:31.131
One in 10,000.

1154
01:22:31.727 --> 01:22:34.765
My case, sir.
That, sir, is for you to prove.


1155
01:22:35.689 --> 01:22:37.350
When in the course of human events,

1156
01:22:37.441 --> 01:22:39.648
our men and women came
to your country as your allies,


1157
01:22:39.735 --> 01:22:41.351
it was not to become your prisoners.

1158
01:22:41.445 --> 01:22:45.484
Sir, may I bring you up to date? We're
living in the 20th century, not in the 18th.


1159
01:22:45.574 --> 01:22:48.191
May I bring you up to date, sir?

1160
01:22:48.285 --> 01:22:50.447
We are not alive at all.

1161
01:22:50.537 --> 01:22:52.369
A point.

1162
01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:55.077
And I am up to date, sir.

1163
01:22:55.167 --> 01:22:58.080
I've been watching you English
from upstairs.


1164
01:22:58.170 --> 01:23:00.582
Your wars, your politics, your business.

1165
01:23:01.381 --> 01:23:04.874
From the tax on tea in 1766

1166
01:23:04.968 --> 01:23:06.754
to a certain report on England

1167
01:23:06.845 --> 01:23:10.509
by five members
of the United States Senate in 1944.


1168
01:23:10.599 --> 01:23:13.933
The defendant has nothing to do
with tea nor senators.


1169
01:23:14.019 --> 01:23:16.977
But other Englishmen had, sir.

1170
01:23:17.064 --> 01:23:20.682
Is Peter D. Carter what you would call
a good Englishman, sir?


1171
01:23:20.776 --> 01:23:22.483
Yes, sir.

1172
01:23:23.487 --> 01:23:25.478
Do you see this glass?

1173
01:23:25.572 --> 01:23:29.110
Out of it Benedict Arnold
drank the health of King George Ill.


1174
01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:35.033
Does it break because it is faulty
or because it is glass?


1175
01:23:37.042 --> 01:23:39.750
Can I tear this piece of paper
because it is defective


1176
01:23:39.836 --> 01:23:41.793
or because it is paper?

1177
01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:44.292
We are all as God made us, sir.

1178
01:23:44.383 --> 01:23:47.967
But our ancestors had a deal to do
in the shaping us, as well.


1179
01:23:48.053 --> 01:23:51.091
I quite agree.
The jury will please note that.


1180
01:23:51.181 --> 01:23:55.049
My lord, may I ask where Mr. Farlan's
grandfather was born?


1181
01:23:55.143 --> 01:23:56.759
Your Honor, the question is irrelevant.

1182
01:23:56.853 --> 01:23:58.639
Could it have been in England?

1183
01:23:58.730 --> 01:24:00.937
You need not answer that question,
Mr. Farlan.


1184
01:24:01.024 --> 01:24:04.016
But I prefer to answer, Your Honor.

1185
01:24:04.111 --> 01:24:06.694
My grandfather left England, sir,
because he didn't like it.


1186
01:24:07.489 --> 01:24:09.730
And Granddad would have liked it
even less today.


1187
01:24:11.034 --> 01:24:12.490
Listen.

1188
01:24:12.911 --> 01:24:14.743
Well, here we are at Lord's.

1189
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:17.822
The voice of England in 1945.

1190
01:24:19.084 --> 01:24:22.793
<i>And here, let me say, that the weather
is much more like cricket weather now.</i>


1191
01:24:22.879 --> 01:24:26.838
<i>It's stopped raining.
Play has been resumed.</i>


1192
01:24:26.925 --> 01:24:29.883
<i>And the crowd of, I say,
about 50,000 people</i>


1193
01:24:29.970 --> 01:24:32.553
<i>have discarded their macs and umbrellas</i>

1194
01:24:32.639 --> 01:24:34.846
<i>and settled down to enjoy the game,</i>

1195
01:24:34.933 --> 01:24:37.140
which, to people all over the world,

1196
01:24:37.227 --> 01:24:39.719
<i>is perhaps more truly representative</i>

1197
01:24:39.813 --> 01:24:41.804
<i>of all that's typically English</i>

1198
01:24:41.898 --> 01:24:43.514
<i>than anything else.</i>

1199
01:24:43.609 --> 01:24:45.896
Do you admit that this
is an English voice, sir?


1200
01:24:47.279 --> 01:24:51.614
<i>That was Wally Hammond who played
a delightful 14-shot off Miller</i> -


1201
01:24:57.456 --> 01:25:00.164
The voice of America in 1945.

1202
01:25:00.250 --> 01:25:02.582
<i>♪ Shoo, shoo, shoo, baby ♪</i>

1203
01:25:04.087 --> 01:25:06.203
<i>♪ >A' Shoo, shoo, shoo, baby A'</i>

1204
01:25:07.716 --> 01:25:10.549

1205

But, for England, I am ready to call
John Donne, Dryden, Pope,


1214
01:25:42.626 --> 01:25:45.368
Wordsworth and Coleridge,
Shelley and Keats,


1215
01:25:45.462 --> 01:25:47.703
Tennyson, Bridges.

1216
01:25:47.798 --> 01:25:50.256
And Milton and Shakespeare.
I concede your point.


1217
01:25:50.342 --> 01:25:52.629
And you've already called Peter Carter.

1218
01:25:52.719 --> 01:25:55.461
- Is he a poet?
- He will be, if you give him time.


1219
01:25:55.555 --> 01:25:57.967
We are here to decide that, sir.

1220
01:25:58.058 --> 01:26:04.100
I can't deny it.

1221
01:26:49.693 --> 01:26:52.310
Can the new world return to the old?

1222
01:26:53.071 --> 01:26:56.109
Should the vibrant humor
of a young American girl


1223
01:26:56.199 --> 01:26:58.736
be stifled in the pages of <i>Punch?</i>

1224
01:26:59.953 --> 01:27:02.741
Should the swift tempo of her life
be slowed


1225
01:27:02.831 --> 01:27:04.663
to the crawl of a match at cricket?

1226
01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:08.492
Should her accustomed native comfort
per force conform


1227
01:27:08.587 --> 01:27:11.830
to England's warm drinks, cold rooms,

1228
01:27:11.923 --> 01:27:15.166
drafty windows, smoky chimneys,
faulty plumbing?


1229
01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:17.171
Two million houses have no windows at all,

1230
01:27:17.262 --> 01:27:19.657
and frequently the roof and walls
have gone with the windows.


1231
01:27:19.681 --> 01:27:21.638
My lord,
I submit that this court is concerned


1232
01:27:21.725 --> 01:27:23.286
with the life and death of Peter Carter,

1233
01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:26.177
and not with past history
or prison plumbing.


1234
01:27:26.271 --> 01:27:28.012
Hear! Hear!

1235
01:27:28.106 --> 01:27:31.599
But Peter Carter's character, sir,
like every other human being,


1236
01:27:31.693 --> 01:27:35.607
has been formed by circumstance,
by a chain of circumstances.


1237
01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:40.074
As Benjamin Franklin said,
“For want of a nail, the shoe was lost.


1238
01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:43.306
For want of a shoe, the horse was lost.
For want of a horse, the rider was lost.


1239
01:27:43.330 --> 01:27:46.823
For want of a rider, the message was lost.
For want of a message, the kingdom was lost.


1240
01:27:46.917 --> 01:27:49.830
And all for the
want of a horseshoe nail.”

1241
01:27:51.505 --> 01:27:54.122
You've heard of Benjamin Franklin, sir?

1242
01:27:54.216 --> 01:27:57.174
I beg you, in George Washington's words,

1243
01:27:57.260 --> 01:27:59.092
“Labor to keep alive in your breast

1244
01:27:59.179 --> 01:28:02.592
that little spark of celestial fire
called conscience.”


1245
01:28:03.141 --> 01:28:05.382
That could not have been said
by an Englishman, sir.


1246
01:28:05.477 --> 01:28:07.468
What was George Washington?

1247
01:28:08.647 --> 01:28:10.012
Conscience, Mr. Farlan.

1248
01:28:10.106 --> 01:28:14.020
Are you insinuating, sir, that something
is wrong with my conscience?


1249
01:28:14.110 --> 01:28:15.851
- I am.
- Your Honor, I protest.


1250
01:28:15.946 --> 01:28:19.780
I'm only trying to give a full picture
of this case to the jury.


1251
01:28:19.866 --> 01:28:22.654
You are trying to prejudice the jury, sir.

1252
01:28:22.744 --> 01:28:26.738
I see that they've been selected
from many races, creeds, and nationalities.


1253
01:28:26.832 --> 01:28:29.324
I cannot believe them interested
in ancient grudges


1254
01:28:29.417 --> 01:28:31.249
against Peter Carter's ancestors,

1255
01:28:31.336 --> 01:28:33.953
nor in present grumblings
about drafty windows.


1256
01:28:34.047 --> 01:28:35.958
I don't need to prejudice the jury, sir.

1257
01:28:36.049 --> 01:28:39.007
They're already prejudiced against
your country, and with good reason.


1258
01:28:39.094 --> 01:28:40.710
You can't pick a jury that isn't.

1259
01:28:40.804 --> 01:28:43.922
Look closely at the distinguished
members of the jury, sir.


1260
01:28:45.934 --> 01:28:47.720
The first member is?

1261
01:28:47.811 --> 01:28:49.597
Jean
-Marie Barault, French.

1262
01:28:49.688 --> 01:28:53.431
Has any century passed without war
between England and France?


1263
01:28:53.525 --> 01:28:56.813
- The second member is -
- Gregorius Johannes Bund, sir.


1264
01:28:56.903 --> 01:28:58.189
Burgher from Transvaal.

1265
01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:00.612
The Boer War, Dr. Reeves.

1266
01:29:00.699 --> 01:29:04.192
- The third member is -
- Ivan Burdei, Russki.


1267
01:29:04.286 --> 01:29:06.323
- What?
- I am Russian.


1268
01:29:06.872 --> 01:29:09.409
The Crimean War, Dr. Reeves.

1269
01:29:09.499 --> 01:29:11.957
- And you, sir?
- Chang Chi Min, Peking.


1270
01:29:12.043 --> 01:29:15.832
Don't forget England's attack
on China in 1857,


1271
01:29:15.922 --> 01:29:18.038
occupying unprotected Peking.

1272
01:29:19.301 --> 01:29:22.259
- And you, sir?
- Rana Tejpalal from the Punjab.


1273
01:29:22.929 --> 01:29:24.670
Think of India, Dr. Reeves.

1274
01:29:25.265 --> 01:29:27.222
Think of India.

1275
01:29:27.309 --> 01:29:28.799
And you, sir, you are?

1276
01:29:28.894 --> 01:29:30.851
James Monahan, Irish.

1277
01:29:34.232 --> 01:29:37.020
Choose a new jury anywhere, Dr. Reeves.

1278
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:40.444
It will always be prejudiced
against your country.


1279
01:29:42.032 --> 01:29:45.696
My lord, I wish to take counsel
for the prosecution's advice.


1280
01:29:45.785 --> 01:29:49.028
I challenge the jury and request
that a new one be chosen.


1281
01:29:49.122 --> 01:29:51.329
Chosen from where, Dr. Reeves?

1282
01:29:51.416 --> 01:29:53.953
- Mr. Farlan said from anywhere.
- Except from England!


1283
01:29:54.044 --> 01:29:55.534
Why not from England?

1284
01:29:55.629 --> 01:29:58.441
Where else in the world have the rights
of the individual been held so high?


1285
01:29:58.465 --> 01:30:02.459
In America, sir, where these rights
are held to be inalienable.


1286
01:30:02.552 --> 01:30:05.965
I doubt if you have more practical freedom
in America than in England.


1287
01:30:06.056 --> 01:30:08.593
An Englishman thinks as he likes
in religion and politics.


1288
01:30:08.683 --> 01:30:10.515
It isn't what a man thinks and says.

1289
01:30:10.602 --> 01:30:13.765
It's when and where and to whom
he thinks and says it.


1290
01:30:13.855 --> 01:30:19.066
A man with a flint and steel striking
sparks over a wet blanket is one thing,


1291
01:30:19.152 --> 01:30:21.519
but striking them over a tinderbox
is another.


1292
01:30:22.447 --> 01:30:24.654
An American baby sucks in freedom

1293
01:30:24.741 --> 01:30:26.857
with the milk of the breast
at which he hangs.


1294
01:30:27.786 --> 01:30:31.529
A man can see further, sir,
from the top of Boston statehouse,


1295
01:30:31.623 --> 01:30:33.830
and see more worth seeing

1296
01:30:33.917 --> 01:30:36.875
than from all the pyramids
and turrets and steeples


1297
01:30:36.962 --> 01:30:38.703
of all the places of the world.

1298
01:30:39.631 --> 01:30:41.838
No smoke, sir.

1299
01:30:41.925 --> 01:30:43.666
No fog, sir.

1300
01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:46.843
And a clean sweep
from the outer light in the sea beyond


1301
01:30:46.930 --> 01:30:49.217
to the New Hampshire mountains.

1302
01:30:49.307 --> 01:30:52.299
Yes, sir, there are great truths,

1303
01:30:52.394 --> 01:30:55.307
higher than mountains
and broader than seas,


1304
01:30:55.397 --> 01:30:58.560
that people look for
from the tops of our hills.


1305
01:30:59.484 --> 01:31:04.024
America, sir, is the only place
where man is full-grown.


1306
01:31:18.294 --> 01:31:20.956
Then I choose a jury of Americans.

1307
01:31:24.718 --> 01:31:29.303
Of Americans, sir, selected
from every walk of American life.


1308
01:31:29.389 --> 01:31:31.847
If there is one who has fought
in the wars of independence,


1309
01:31:31.933 --> 01:31:34.265
I want one who has fought
shoulder to shoulder with us


1310
01:31:34.352 --> 01:31:37.094
against our common enemies
in this century.


1311
01:31:37.188 --> 01:31:41.227
If the third has a mind
that can only think 170 years back,


1312
01:31:41.317 --> 01:31:45.151
I want the fourth
to be thinking 170 years ahead.


1313
01:31:45.238 --> 01:31:48.981
I cannot deny that I hope,
know that I know,


1314
01:31:49.075 --> 01:31:52.238
that this jury will be prejudiced
in favor of my case,


1315
01:31:52.328 --> 01:31:55.992
for I am pleading for the rights
of the individual against the system.


1316
01:31:56.082 --> 01:31:59.165
But it is also against the law,
Dr. Reeves,


1317
01:31:59.252 --> 01:32:01.835
the eternal law of the universe.

1318
01:32:01.921 --> 01:32:04.413
Nothing is stronger than the law.

1319
01:32:04.507 --> 01:32:06.339
The whole universe is built upon it.

1320
01:32:06.843 --> 01:32:10.131
This is a court
of justice, not of law.

1321
01:32:11.181 --> 01:32:14.970
My lord, I ask for a new jury
of American citizens.


1322
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:21.104
- Do you agree, Mr. Farlan?
- I would welcome such a jury, Your Honor.


1323
01:32:21.775 --> 01:32:23.766
The jury will stand.

1324
01:32:25.945 --> 01:32:29.154
The jury will retire,
and a new jury will take their place.


1325
01:32:36.956 --> 01:32:39.368
Robert Dupont, 
American citizen.

1326
01:32:45.131 --> 01:32:48.465
Lieutenant Pete Vandereyk,
American citizen.


1327
01:32:54.349 --> 01:32:57.182
Alexander Barabaranoff, 
American citizen.

1328
01:33:02.357 --> 01:33:04.564
George Wong, American citizen.

1329
01:33:11.407 --> 01:33:14.240
Jefferson Lincoln Brown, 
American citizen.

1330
01:33:18.289 --> 01:33:21.202
Patrick Aloysious Mahoney,
American citizen.


1331
01:33:25.672 --> 01:33:27.504
The jury will be seated.

1332
01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.040
Counsel for the defense?

1333
01:33:31.386 --> 01:33:36.131
Here in this rose is my case.
And what is my case?


1334
01:33:36.224 --> 01:33:38.181
I entirely agree with Mr. Farlan.

1335
01:33:38.268 --> 01:33:41.306
Has Peter Carter fallen in love
during the allotted extra -


1336
01:33:41.396 --> 01:33:42.807
Borrowed, Dr. Reeves.

1337
01:33:42.897 --> 01:33:46.356
Disputed extra 20 hours he had
or hasn't he?


1338
01:33:46.442 --> 01:33:50.982
Has someone, the name is unimportant,
fallen in love with him?


1339
01:33:51.072 --> 01:33:54.485
Now, here are two young people
who would never have met


1340
01:33:54.576 --> 01:33:56.192
but for a mistake higher up,

1341
01:33:56.286 --> 01:34:00.120
penalized for the most natural
and simple thing in the world.


1342
01:34:00.206 --> 01:34:01.662
They fell in love.

1343
01:34:02.542 --> 01:34:07.332
Here in this tear
are love and truth and friendship.


1344
01:34:07.881 --> 01:34:12.045
Those qualities and those qualities alone
can build a new world today


1345
01:34:12.135 --> 01:34:14.251
and must build a better one tomorrow.

1346
01:34:15.013 --> 01:34:16.799
That is my case,

1347
01:34:16.890 --> 01:34:21.134
and upon it I demand a verdict
that Peter Carter shall live.


1348
01:34:24.105 --> 01:34:27.393
Your Honor, we all feel
that the defendant and this young girl


1349
01:34:27.483 --> 01:34:29.144
should be given the chance to be heard.

1350
01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:32.937
My lord, nothing is impossible.

1351
01:34:37.493 --> 01:34:38.983
The court will adjourn.

1352
01:35:52.819 --> 01:35:57.313
There is no reason to deny ourselves, for
the dimension of time will not disturb us.


1353
01:35:57.407 --> 01:36:01.150
The jury feels it would help establish
a true picture of the conditions.


1354
01:36:02.412 --> 01:36:04.119
Very well.

1355
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:08.956
I call-

1356
01:36:09.043 --> 01:36:10.454
My diagnosis was right.

1357
01:36:10.545 --> 01:36:14.254
Fine vascular meningeal adhesions
binding the optic nerve to the brain.


1358
01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:15.922
The internal carotid and the chiasm.

1359
01:36:16.009 --> 01:36:18.592
Similar adhesions
between the chiasm and the brain.


1360
01:36:19.345 --> 01:36:22.337
Did I tell you about my operation?

1361
01:36:23.182 --> 01:36:26.265
Dr. Reeves, we are not here
to check your diagnosis,


1362
01:36:26.352 --> 01:36:28.810
but to put certain questions
to this young man.


1363
01:36:28.896 --> 01:36:29.977
Quite right, certainly.

1364
01:36:30.064 --> 01:36:33.477
I call Squadron Leader Peter D. Carter.

1365
01:36:36.154 --> 01:36:38.441
- Hello, Peter.
- Hello, Frank. How's the operation going?


1366
01:36:38.531 --> 01:36:41.364
- Fine. Liza is a very good man.
- He better be.


1367
01:36:42.327 --> 01:36:44.238
Peter Carter,
you are on the witness stand.


1368
01:36:44.329 --> 01:36:47.447
- You are under oath. Do you understand?
- Yes, Mr. Farlan.


1369
01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:49.326
You know me, sir?

1370
01:36:49.417 --> 01:36:51.533
There's no mistaking you.

1371
01:36:54.047 --> 01:36:56.539
Your smile is not unattractive, sir.

1372
01:36:56.632 --> 01:36:59.294
Did you use it to enamor
this young American lady?


1373
01:36:59.385 --> 01:37:00.796
I love her, sir.

1374
01:37:00.887 --> 01:37:02.548
Answer the question.

1375
01:37:02.638 --> 01:37:05.630
Would you repeat the question?
It, urn, had “enamored” in it.


1376
01:37:05.725 --> 01:37:07.716
Never mind the exact question.

1377
01:37:07.810 --> 01:37:11.849
Did you consciously try to influence
the emotions of this young American lady?


1378
01:37:11.939 --> 01:37:14.180
We fell in love before we'd ever met.

1379
01:37:14.275 --> 01:37:16.562
- You claim you love her.
- I do love her.


1380
01:37:16.652 --> 01:37:19.485
- Can you prove it?
- Oh, give me time, sir.


1381
01:37:19.572 --> 01:37:21.654
Fifty years will do.

1382
01:37:21.741 --> 01:37:23.482
But can you prove it?

1383
01:37:23.576 --> 01:37:26.944
Well, can a starving man prove
he's hungry except by eating?


1384
01:37:27.038 --> 01:37:30.030
- Would you die for her?
- I would.


1385
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.411
But, uh, I'd rather live.

1386
01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:35.911
Young devil.

1387
01:37:36.005 --> 01:37:38.622
Your Honor,
I apologize for the expression.


1388
01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:41.382
- Your witness.
- No questions.


1389
01:37:42.178 --> 01:37:44.590
- Conductor 71.
- Monsieur?


1390
01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:46.967
Is the young lady available?

1391
01:37:47.058 --> 01:37:49.140
- She sleeps.
- She sleeps?


1392
01:37:49.227 --> 01:37:52.936
- The jury will please note that.
- I put her to sleep.


1393
01:37:53.022 --> 01:37:54.604
Indeed, why?

1394
01:37:54.690 --> 01:37:56.806
To enable you to call her, sir.

1395
01:37:56.901 --> 01:37:59.063
The jury will please note that.

1396
01:37:59.153 --> 01:38:01.645
I do call her, Your Honor.

1397
01:38:07.995 --> 01:38:10.783
You are before the high court
in the case of Peter Carter.


1398
01:38:12.083 --> 01:38:15.542
You have been called as a witness
by the prosecution.


1399
01:38:15.628 --> 01:38:16.959
You will tell the truth.

1400
01:38:17.839 --> 01:38:20.752
This gentleman is counsel
for the prosecution.


1401
01:38:23.803 --> 01:38:27.171
- Child, where were you born?
- In Boston, sir.


1402
01:38:27.265 --> 01:38:29.302
Do you know this man?

1403
01:38:29.392 --> 01:38:31.474
- I think so.
- You think so?


1404
01:38:31.561 --> 01:38:36.180
- I only met him a few days ago.
- You hardly know him.


1405
01:38:36.274 --> 01:38:39.483
- How can you think you love him?
- But I do love him.


1406
01:38:39.569 --> 01:38:41.435
- Nonsense, my child.
- I object.


1407
01:38:41.529 --> 01:38:45.022
- Counsel will withdraw the expression.
- It's all right, Frank. He's right.


1408
01:38:45.116 --> 01:38:47.653
There's no sense in love.

1409
01:38:47.743 --> 01:38:50.405
Wisdom still flowers in Boston.

1410
01:38:51.497 --> 01:38:53.864
Can you prove that you love him?

1411
01:38:54.584 --> 01:38:56.200
How can I?

1412
01:38:56.294 --> 01:38:58.956
- Would you be willing to die for him?
- Yes.


1413
01:39:01.549 --> 01:39:03.586
Would you take his place
in the balance sheet?


1414
01:39:03.676 --> 01:39:04.586
Yes.

1415
01:39:04.677 --> 01:39:05.904
- Don't believe her!
- Would you?


1416
01:39:05.928 --> 01:39:07.072
- My lord?
- Stand aside, sir!


1417
01:39:07.096 --> 01:39:09.283
- You've got no right to ask.
- How dare you address me like that!


1418
01:39:09.307 --> 01:39:12.265
- Peter, you must obey.
- Well, of all the dirty tricks!


1419
01:39:12.351 --> 01:39:14.329
This is contempt of court.
I'll have you committed.


1420
01:39:14.353 --> 01:39:15.956
Commit away.
Don't answer any more questions.


1421
01:39:15.980 --> 01:39:17.891
Do you realize that by this attitude

1422
01:39:17.982 --> 01:39:20.144
you've forfeited any chance
of winning your case?


1423
01:39:20.234 --> 01:39:22.271
All right, but you
won't get June as well.

1424
01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:26.863
Your Honor, members of the jury,

1425
01:39:26.949 --> 01:39:28.940
I'm afraid he really does love her.

1426
01:39:29.035 --> 01:39:30.742
Your witness.

1427
01:39:33.623 --> 01:39:35.990
June, you know me well. 
Do you trust me?

1428
01:39:36.083 --> 01:39:37.744
Yes, Frank, I trust you.

1429
01:39:37.835 --> 01:39:41.794
It is absolutely necessary that you take
Peter's place in the other world.


1430
01:39:42.381 --> 01:39:43.381
Have you gone mad?

1431
01:39:43.466 --> 01:39:47.084
If you really love him, June,
step onto this staircase and come with us.


1432
01:39:47.178 --> 01:39:50.261
- You are mad!
- It is the only way to prove your love.


1433
01:39:50.348 --> 01:39:51.930
- I do love him.
- You shan't go.


1434
01:39:52.016 --> 01:39:54.178
- My lord, I ask the court to restrain him.
- Granted.


1435
01:39:54.852 --> 01:39:56.342
June.

1436
01:40:03.528 --> 01:40:05.940
Take care, Dr. Reeves.

1437
01:40:06.030 --> 01:40:09.239
In the whole universe,
nothing is stronger than the law.


1438
01:40:16.457 --> 01:40:18.039
Good-bye, darling.

1439
01:40:42.817 --> 01:40:46.401
Yes, Mr. Farlan, nothing is stronger
than the law in the universe,


1440
01:40:46.487 --> 01:40:49.570
but on Earth,
nothing is stronger than love.


1441
01:40:58.124 --> 01:41:02.834
Members of the jury,
as Sir Walter Scott is always saying,


1442
01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:06.538
“In peace, love tunes the shepherd's reed.

1443
01:41:06.632 --> 01:41:08.873
In war, he mounts the warrior's steed.

1444
01:41:09.677 --> 01:41:12.339
In halls, in gay attire is seen.

1445
01:41:12.430 --> 01:41:14.717
In hamlets, dances on the green.

1446
01:41:15.641 --> 01:41:18.133
Love rules the court, the camp, the grove,

1447
01:41:18.227 --> 01:41:20.719
and men below and saints above,

1448
01:41:20.813 --> 01:41:24.556
for love is heaven and heaven is love.”

1449
01:41:24.650 --> 01:41:26.732
Will you please consider your verdict?

1450
01:41:30.156 --> 01:41:32.773
- Case for the defendant, Your Honor.
- Bravo!


1451
01:41:34.327 --> 01:41:36.159
The appeal is granted.

1452
01:41:36.245 --> 01:41:39.988
There now remains the new date
on Squadron Leader Carter's file.


1453
01:41:40.082 --> 01:41:42.289
Will, uh, both counsel approve it?

1454
01:41:45.755 --> 01:41:49.293
- Does that satisfy you, Dr. Reeves?
- Very generous, my lord.


1455
01:41:49.383 --> 01:41:51.875
Do you agree, Mr. Farlan?

1456
01:41:51.969 --> 01:41:54.586
Isn't that a little too much, Your Honor?

1457
01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:56.421
I agree.

1458
01:41:57.433 --> 01:41:59.765
My lord, I hope this will not
establish a precedent.


1459
01:41:59.852 --> 01:42:01.092
"L Object!
"I Object!


1460
01:42:01.187 --> 01:42:02.928
- Uh, you, sir.
- You, sir.


1461
01:42:03.022 --> 01:42:05.104
You mean the rights
of the common man -

1462
01:42:05.191 --> 01:42:07.478
- The uncommon man.
- Exactly.


1463
01:42:07.568 --> 01:42:11.106
The rights of the uncommon man
must always be respected.


1464
01:42:11.197 --> 01:42:12.687
Exactly.

1465
01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:23.373
Keep his head firm, between the sandbags.
I've written him up.


1466
01:42:23.459 --> 01:42:25.951
- Tell Nurse I'll send the notes.
- Yes, sir.


1467
01:42:29.548 --> 01:42:30.913
Congratulations.

1468
01:42:31.008 --> 01:42:32.874
An interesting case.

1469
01:42:40.017 --> 01:42:41.928
Peter!

1470
01:42:42.019 --> 01:42:45.102
Don't forget your book!

1471
01:43:18.389 --> 01:43:19.720
Frank.

1472
01:43:22.226 --> 01:43:23.341
Frank.

1473
01:43:25.146 --> 01:43:26.557
Frank.

1474
01:43:42.955 --> 01:43:43.990
Hello.

1475
01:43:45.082 --> 01:43:46.243
Hello.

1476
01:43:47.793 --> 01:43:50.751
- We won.
- I know, darling.
