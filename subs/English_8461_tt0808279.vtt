1
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:45.330
Movie ni Lord Welhim

2
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.430
Suliotis?

3
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.930
Close.

4
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.630
Bj√∂rling is easy.

5
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.930
Tebaldi.

6
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.630
- You win.
- My turn.


7
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.130
- No looking.
- I'm not.


8
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.430
Did Daddy look?

9
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.130
No.

10
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.530
You sure?

11
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.430
- Yes.
- Okay.


12
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.230
Oh, God.

13
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.930
Gigli?

14
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.730
Of course, but what?

15
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.630
Well? Darling?

16
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.230
I'd say Handel.

17
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.930
Right. But what is it?

18
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.130
Not a clue.

19
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.930
- Well?
- I give up. What is it?


20
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.230
Three-two to me.

21
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.030
Hey, hands off.
Hey, no. Just... Just listen.


22
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.930
Hey! That's not fair.

23
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.230
What?

24
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.730
Practicing's not fair.

25
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.130
You're still on for 10 tomorrow, right?

26
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.430
You're still coming?

27
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.430
Uh, yeah, sure.

28
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.930
We have to launch the boat.

29
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.930
Can you give us a hand,
in about 20 minutes?


30
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.130
Yeah, sure. Yeah, I'll be there.
I'll come over in 20 minutes.


31
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.630
Okay, great. See you then.

32
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.530
Bye!

33
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.530
What was up with him?

34
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.530
Don't know.

35
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.830
Seems weird.

36
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.630
She didn't say a word.

37
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.130
Who did you talk to
about the game tomorrow?


38
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.530
With her.

39
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.130
- When?
- Day before yesterday.


40
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.830
- And?
- Nothing, she was fine.


41
00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.130
Where's Jenny?

42
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.430
I don't know, sweetheart.
Maybe she's at the beach or inside.


43
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.430
- Who were those guys?
- Don't know.


44
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.430
Maybe relatives.
Doesn't her brother have a son that age?


45
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.130
Don't put that there.
Take your stuff upstairs, please.


46
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.330
Yeah.

47
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.130
Keep the doorway clear
or someone's gonna trip.


48
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.730
We have a lot more in the car.

49
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.130
Hey, are you listening to me?

50
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.030
I'm going, already.

51
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.430
Open the windows, please.
We need to let some air in.


52
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.330
Yeah, Mom.

53
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.530
Get out, Lucky. Out.

54
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.330
Come on, get down.

55
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.130
Come on.

56
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.430
- George?
- Yeah?


57
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.430
Where are the other groceries?

58
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.230
I'll get it.

59
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.030
Golf clubs were in the way.

60
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.030
Hurry up, everything's getting warm.

61
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.530
This cooler's a piece of shit.

62
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.330
Stop it, buddy.

63
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.530
You'll knock me over.

64
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.930
Go to Mommy, go on, go to Mommy.
She'll give you a treat.


65
00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.530
The meat's in the other box.
Will you grab it for me?


66
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.130
I'm just opening the windows.

67
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.130
Leave the shutters in the front,
it'll get too hot.


68
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.530
Lucky, come on. 
Honey, get out.

69
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.330
Will you...? Come on,
I'll get you something in a minute.


70
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.130
Lucky, please.
Will you call the dog, honey?


71
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.430
Lucky, get out of here.

72
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.930
- Call the dog.
- Lucky.


73
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.230
Go on, honey.

74
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.330
Come here, come to Daddy.

75
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.530
Stop it, Lucky. Be quiet.

76
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.130
I'm sorry. He's...

77
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.030
He's nuts. Come in.

78
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.830
Hey there, Fred. 
Good to see you.

79
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.130
Thanks for helping.
It'd be pretty hard on my own.


80
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.830
No problem. This is Paul.

81
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:41.530
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure.


82
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.930
Paul's father
is a business associate of mine.


83
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:46.930
Thanks for helping.

84
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:50.830
No, the pleasure's all mine.
Not so much his.


85
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.530
- Lucky, come on.
- Sorry, he's crazy.


86
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.830
Stop it!

87
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.130
- Hey! Come over here!
- Thank you, honey.


88
00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:59.030
So when did you get here?

89
00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.830
- Last week.
- You too?


90
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.130
- No.
- Yes.


91
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.930
Well, they didn't get here till
the weekend. We got here on Friday.


92
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.530
Hi, Fred. Thanks for coming right over.

93
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.730
It's good to see you. How's Eve?

94
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.330
Fine.

95
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.930
- Hello.
- Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.


96
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.630
<i>- And where are the Keys?
- Got it?</i>


97
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.030
<i>On the southern coast of Florida.</i>

98
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.430
<i>- Isn't it hotter down there?
- No.</i>


99
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.430
Push.

100
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:25.930
<i>It ain't all the time.</i>

101
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:31.630
<i>Last year when I was in Miami
it rained cats and dogs the whole time.</i>


102
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.330
<i>And you were up here and you were
swimming every day, remember?</i>


103
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.930
Still, it sucks that Jenny isn't here.
It's boring without...


104
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.230
Careful.

105
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
I am being careful.

106
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.930
That was an expensive overhaul.

107
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.830
See? Not a single scratch.

108
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.030
Well, now you can help me
put up the boom.


109
00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.030
You got it?

110
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.230
Yeah.

111
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.030
- Put it down over there.
- Okay.


112
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.930
But she told me
she'd be here the whole time.


113
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:17.330
Yeah, well, I don't know either.
I don't know why she told you that.


114
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.330
Maybe she went out with a friend.

115
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.330
We'll ask her mother tomorrow
when we see her.


116
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:27.330
Anyway,
forecast for tomorrow is wind.


117
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.730
Why was Uncle Fred
behaving so strangely?


118
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.330
Well, I'm not surprised.

119
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.230
She got pretty worked up about it
last time.


120
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:41.430
Come on, just forget about it.
She's not gonna change.


121
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.430
Yeah, well,
you're only gonna upset yourself.


122
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.530
Exactly. That's what I'm saying.

123
00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:53.330
Oh, they're great.
They're outside playing on the boat.


124
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.130
Uh...

125
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.030
I don't know, 5, 5:30.

126
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:01.630
My kitchen clock's not working,
so I have to get that fixed on Monday.


127
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:08.030
Yeah, exactly,
that's what I'm doing right now.


128
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.030
We're having steak.

129
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:14.130
It all defrosted,
so now I have to get rid of it.


130
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.930
You should come on out.

131
00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.630
Yeah, that was stupid of me.

132
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.130
I froze 4 pounds of steak...

133
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:25.030
...now I'm standing here
looking at half a cow.


134
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:29.730
I'm not joking. Come on out, please,
just for the weekend.


135
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.630
Well, tell him not to be so difficult.

136
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.130
Hold on a second.

137
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.630
- What is it, honey?
- We need a sharp knife.


138
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.330
Okay.

139
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.730
- I'd like to see it again.
- Okay.


140
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.130
- Tell your father.
- Okay.


141
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.830
So, what do you think?

142
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.130
Well, tell your sweetheart
to bring his laptop with him.


143
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.830
Jump in the car,
and you'll be here in an hour.


144
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.730
Well, he shouldn't be so antisocial.

145
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:06.930
Come on, we've got enough steak
for the whole week.


146
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.430
What is it? Hold on. Okay.

147
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:13.130
All right. Well, listen, just call me
and let me know, all right?


148
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.830
Okay, all right, Nancy.

149
00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:16.430
- Bye.
- Bye.


150
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:18.930
What now, honey?

151
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.330
- There's someone here.
- Where?


152
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.430
At the door.

153
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.530
- Hello.
- Hello.


154
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:34.030
Sorry to disturb you, I'm staying
next door. I saw you earlier at the gate.


155
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.130
Oh, yeah, of course.

156
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.030
Please, come in.

157
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.230
So how can I help you?

158
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.230
Tell your dad we're eating
in 10 minutes.


159
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:49.330
Okay.

160
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.930
Well, Eve s...

161
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.130
I mean, Mrs. Thompson sent me.

162
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:57.230
She's cooking and she ran out of eggs
and asked if you could help her out.


163
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.230
Of course. How many does she need?

164
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.530
Four.

165
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.030
Four?

166
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:04.630
What for?

167
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.530
- Excuse me?
- What for?


168
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:11.630
What does she need the eggs for?
I mean, what's she cooking?


169
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:14.130
I have no idea.

170
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:20.230
So are they okay just like this
or do you need the carton?


171
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.230
Whatever you want.

172
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:24.530
How did you get in here?

173
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.330
Down there.

174
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.830
I mean, down by the water.

175
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.730
But you're not wet.

176
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:34.330
There's a hole in the fence.
By the water, not in the water.


177
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:39.030
Fred sh... I mean, Mr. Thompson,
knows about it. He showed it to me.


178
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:41.530
Oh, I see.

179
00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.830
So you sure they're okay like this?

180
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.930
Yeah, yeah. That's okay. No problem.

181
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.130
- Thank you very much. Thank you.
- All right.


182
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.630
Say hello to Eve. Tell her we're
looking forward to the game tomorrow.


183
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.830
I'll tell her. Thanks again.

184
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.730
Thanks to Fred and your friend for help...

185
00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:57.230
- Shit.
- What happened?


186
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.830
It's not a disaster.

187
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.930
We have to go grocery shopping
on Monday anyway.


188
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.730
I'm really sorry.

189
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.730
It's not so bad. None of us eat eggs
for breakfast anyway.


190
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.930
So the disaster's under control.

191
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:47.130
Well, thank you. I'm sorry,
I should have paid more attention.


192
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.830
Well, you shouldn't cry
over spilt milk, right?


193
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:50.930
You're really nice.

194
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.630
You do what you can.

195
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.730
I really am sorry.

196
00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.430
I'm very clumsy, you know?
I think I have two left hands.


197
00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:09.530
- Then you're the man for carrying eggs.
- Yes, you could say that.


198
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.230
So, what are we going to do now?

199
00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:19.430
Well, we have a lot of steak,
but we might be expecting guests...


200
00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:22.430
...and they definitely eat eggs
for breakfast.


201
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:24.230
You'll still have four left.

202
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.030
It's a box with a dozen, isn't it?
Or am I mistaken?


203
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.730
No, you're not mistaken.

204
00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.630
So would you like the carton this time?

205
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:43.530
- It's not necessary.
- Are you sure?


206
00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:45.630
But if you insist.

207
00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:46.830
If I insist?

208
00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:50.330
Well, it might be better, I guess.

209
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.830
- Oh, God.
- What?


210
00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:00.230
Oh, no.

211
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.130
I'm sorry.

212
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.130
Before you destroy
the rest of the kitchen...


213
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:13.530
...maybe you should take the eggs
and leave. All right?


214
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.230
Yes.

215
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:22.630
No carton?

216
00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.130
I'm really sorry. Honestly.

217
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:35.930
Me too.

218
00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.030
Here you go.

219
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.230
Thank you very much. Thank you.

220
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.430
I'll tell Mrs. Thompson
how nice you were.


221
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:43.830
Do what you have to do.

222
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.030
Have a nice day.

223
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.030
Excuse me?

224
00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:00.130
Lucky. Lucky. Get down.
Come on, come on, stop that.


225
00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:02.730
Get out of here. 
Go on, get lost.

226
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.130
I'm sorry. He's completely harmless.
He just wants to play.


227
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.330
That's a strange way to play.

228
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.330
- Did he hurt you?
- Peter is afraid of dogs.


229
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.130
Oh, I'm sorry.

230
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.330
Me too. He jumped on me.

231
00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.930
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah.


232
00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:22.430
- Should I lock him up so you can leave?
- That won't be necessary.


233
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.030
- I can call my husband.
- It's not gonna be necessary.


234
00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.030
It's my fault.
I completely forgot about the dog.


235
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.530
I should've come myself and...

236
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.330
Wow.

237
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.630
That's a really great set of clubs.

238
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.930
It's Callaway, right?

239
00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.430
Awesome.

240
00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:46.630
These are wonderful. May I?

241
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.830
I guess we don't
stand a chance tomorrow, do we?


242
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.830
The club doesn't make the player.

243
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.030
That's true.

244
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.730
Would you mind if I tried this?

245
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.530
Just once, please? Real quick.

246
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.630
Outside. Please? Yes?

247
00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.730
I'll hit it towards the bay. Yes?

248
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.530
If it makes you happy.

249
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.130
Thank you.

250
00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:25.230
Thanks a lot. Really.

251
00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.030
Thank you.

252
00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:28.730
Excuse me.

253
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.730
He loves golf. We both do.

254
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:39.330
- Excuse me?
- We both do. We both love golf.


255
00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.630
Lucky!

256
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.730
Lucky. Be quiet.

257
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.830
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know.


258
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.530
It's probably too hot for him too.

259
00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:27.830
I'll take a look.

260
00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:54.730
It's wonderful. It really
makes a difference, like night and day.


261
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.830
Thanks a lot.

262
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:58.830
Sure.

263
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.630
Lucky!

264
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.330
- Where's Tom?
- Who?


265
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:04.430
Did you give him the eggs?

266
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.930
Excuse me?

267
00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:14.230
Driver's really first class.
You have to try it.


268
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.330
Listen, young man, I don't know
what kind of game you're playing...


269
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.730
...but I don't wanna
be a part of it.

270
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.130
Would you please leave now?

271
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.530
What game?

272
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:39.630
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I don't understand
why you're suddenly being so unfriendly.


273
00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:43.630
- Did Tom or I do anything to upset you?
- Please leave.


274
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:48.130
Did you misbehave while I was outside?
Was he rude?


275
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:51.230
- Did he say something that...?
- Stop it.


276
00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:00.830
I've asked you nicely to leave.
Now I'd like you to go.


277
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:03.530
Well...

278
00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:08.730
I don't understand what's upset you,
but if you insist.


279
00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:12.430
Just give Tom the eggs,
and we won't bother you anymore.


280
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:14.130
Excuse me?

281
00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:18.430
We'll have to tell Eve and Fred. Nothing
like this has happened to me before.


282
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.330
What about you?

283
00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.830
- Can you just give us the eggs, please?
- No.


284
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:27.730
How dare you.

285
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.030
Please just go. Right now.

286
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.230
Did I do something wrong?

287
00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.430
I asked you to leave. 
I want you to go.

288
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:38.130
Have you seen the dog? 
Is he with you?

289
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.030
- Will you throw them out?
- It's good you're here, Mr. Farber.


290
00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:43.330
- That's your name, isn't it? Farber?
- Yes.


291
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.030
Yeah, Fre... Mr. 
Thompson told us.

292
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.030
- What's going on?
- I want them to leave.


293
00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:51.130
Your wife's under the wrong impression.
I'm happy you're here.


294
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.630
I'm certain you can
figure out this misunderstanding.


295
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.530
- George, please.
- Dad, I can't...


296
00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.530
Just go. Please, go.

297
00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.830
Hey, Ann.

298
00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:04.030
This is ridiculous. 
I can't believe this.

299
00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.330
- Honey, do you mind?
- No, he's fine.


300
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.830
- May I please explain what happened?
- Please do.


301
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:12.130
Mrs. Thompson sent me over
to ask for some eggs, and then...


302
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:15.230
Your wife gave Peter the eggs,
but, unfortunately, they broke.


303
00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:17.230
And then she gave me
another four eggs...


304
00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:19.830
...but the dog jumped on me,
and now...


305
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:23.430
You had a dozen and you're going
shopping on Monday anyway.


306
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.130
We just want the eggs, that's all.

307
00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.930
Ann, can you tell me
what's going on here?


308
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.530
Honey, can you just tell
me what's going on?


309
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.430
Just give them to them.

310
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:41.430
- Can I have them now?
- Hold on a moment.


311
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:44.430
Ann, if it's just about some eggs,
why are you so angry?


312
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:46.830
Look, I'm not going
to justify myself in front...


313
00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:51.330
I asked you to throw them out.
Maybe I have my reasons.


314
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.730
Do what you want. 
I've had enough.

315
00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:58.330
Ann.

316
00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:03.830
I'm sorry.

317
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:06.730
My wife's not feeling well, so...

318
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:08.430
Yeah.

319
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.930
Could you please leave?

320
00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:15.330
I can hardly play the mediator
if I don't know the facts, now, can I?


321
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:19.430
So could you just leave, please?

322
00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:26.030
Please, the...

323
00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.130
- What?
- Just give them to him.


324
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.430
- What the hell is going on here?
- Nothing's going on, sir.


325
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:36.530
He asked for the eggs,
the dog attacked him, they broke.


326
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:40.630
Now he would like some more.
What is so difficult to understand?


327
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.630
You better watch your tone,
young man.


328
00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:49.230
You better be careful, old man,
or I'll break your eggs.


329
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.430
Now, please leave, right now.

330
00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:55.830
- Mr. Farber?
- What?


331
00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:58.330
Dad!

332
00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.230
Is it broken?

333
00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.430
Hey, hey, come on, come on,
come on.


334
00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:07.230
Hey. Come on. Behave yourself.

335
00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:09.830
Behave yourself, okay?

336
00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:12.530
Okay? I don't want to hurt you...

337
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:15.830
...so you have to behave yourself.

338
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:21.730
- Mom.
- What is it, baby?


339
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.030
Please, just, ma'am,
stay where you are, okay?


340
00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:26.530
Please, stay.

341
00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:31.930
- He slapped me in the face.
- Yeah, he started it.


342
00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:36.930
You can help him,
just don't do anything stupid. Help him.


343
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.330
- You should bring him a chair.
- What happened?


344
00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:46.330
It's my knee.

345
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.630
You should take off his pants.
He should sit. Bring him a chair.


346
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:51.830
Go get him a chair, honey.

347
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:54.730
Be careful.

348
00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.930
Peter is a... He's a medical student.
He can help you with it.


349
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.130
Can you please take off your pants?

350
00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.630
If you don't let me see
your wound, I can't help you.


351
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:09.530
I'm sorry I hurt you,
but you forced me to, you must admit.


352
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:14.530
Come on, Mr. Farber,
be reasonable. Let him look at your leg.


353
00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:16.430
He can help you with it.

354
00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:20.830
Would you please...

355
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.230
...leave?

356
00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:25.730
Please.

357
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.230
We won't get anywhere like this.

358
00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:35.630
You have to let him help you,
you don't really have a choice.


359
00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:37.530
You're the ship's captain, sir.

360
00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:42.930
You're aware that onboard,
the captain's word is law, aren't you?


361
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:45.530
So, what do you want to do?

362
00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:48.130
You want to call someone?

363
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:51.230
An ambulance or the police?

364
00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:53.230
I won't stop you.

365
00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.430
Neither will Tom. Right, Tom?

366
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.030
Well, what are you waiting for?

367
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.630
He dropped the cell phone in the sink.

368
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:17.930
- Why are you doing this?
- Why not?


369
00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:21.130
Okay, let's play another game.

370
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.030
It's a guessing game.

371
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.430
What is this?

372
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.330
Sir?

373
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:48.230
It's a golf ball.

374
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:51.830
Correct. It's a golf ball.

375
00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.930
But why do I
have it in my pocket?

376
00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:58.330
Hm? The lady knows why.

377
00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:00.230
Because?

378
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:04.930
Well?

379
00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:09.630
Well?

380
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:14.230
Because you didn't hit it.

381
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:18.430
Correct. Because I didn't hit it.
And why didn't I hit it?


382
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.630
Because something stopped you.

383
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:26.530
Correct. Because I had
to test the club in another way.


384
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:37.630
Where is he?

385
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:39.530
Cold.

386
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:47.030
Even colder.

387
00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.930
Cold.

388
00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:56.430
Ice cold.

389
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.330
Warmer.

390
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:09.830
Warmer.

391
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:11.730
Little cold.

392
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:16.130
Warmer.

393
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:19.130
Warmer.

394
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:22.130
Warmer.

395
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:26.530
Cold.

396
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:31.030
Cold.

397
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:34.430
Warmer.

398
00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:37.530
Warm, cold.

399
00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.030
Warmer.

400
00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:44.530
Really warm.

401
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:07.030
Would you please go to the kitchen
and get me something to eat?


402
00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:09.630
That be possible?

403
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:24.430
Maybe there's some bananas or...

404
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:30.230
Please don't think about bringing back
a knife or anything like that...


405
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.230
...or I'd be sorry.

406
00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.530
For you, I mean.

407
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:44.530
It's getting cloudy.

408
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:51.930
That's very nice of you, thank you.

409
00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:53.530
Hello?

410
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:55.530
Hello?

411
00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:57.430
Hello?

412
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.530
Hello?

413
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:03.830
Yeah!

414
00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:05.530
Hello!

415
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:08.530
Hi, sweetie.

416
00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:17.930
Where are you?

417
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:21.830
Come on down to the water.

418
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:27.630
We're both thinking the same thing,
aren't we?


419
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:30.530
Hm?

420
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:40.030
We saw your boat.

421
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:42.330
Hi, Betsy.

422
00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:44.530
Hi, Robert.

423
00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.830
When did you get here?

424
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:49.530
Today.

425
00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:52.130
We're still unpacking.

426
00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:55.130
How long you staying?

427
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:58.630
Probably a week or two.
We're not sure yet.


428
00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:02.230
Oh, wonderful. 
So nice to see you.

429
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:06.430
- Let me help you.
- Thank you.


430
00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:09.930
- Have you ever met my sister-in-law?
- No.


431
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:11.930
Pleased to meet you.

432
00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.730
Hello, nice to meet you too.

433
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:16.830
Hello. Hi, Robert.

434
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:18.830
- Hi, how are you?
- Fine.


435
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:24.330
This is Paul. He's staying
with the Thompsons next door.


436
00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:27.330
- Hi, pleased to meet you.
- Hi, Paul. You cold?


437
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:31.430
- Oh, no, I have... I have eczema.
- Oh.


438
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:34.430
You should go swimming,
the water works wonders for that here.


439
00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:36.530
Thank you, that's good advice.

440
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:38.930
- Hello, pleased to meet you.
- Hello.


441
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.030
How's George?

442
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:42.530
Fine, thanks.

443
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:43.930
Where is he?

444
00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:49.430
He pulled a muscle putting up the mast,
so he's lying down, resting.


445
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:52.830
So sorry to hear that. That's what
happens when you try to do too much.


446
00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.930
Robert, on the other hand,
would never dream of launching a boat.


447
00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.630
Right, Robert?

448
00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:01.130
Tell your hubby to get better,
we're grilling every night.


449
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:02.230
I'll tell him.

450
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:06.130
I mean it, as soon as he's better,
swing by. Robert's son is here.


451
00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:08.830
He brought his little girlfriend.
He'd like her for sure.


452
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:11.730
All right. Well, listen,
it's great to see you, darling.


453
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:15.530
Listen, if the weather stays like this,
you'll probably have to take the car.


454
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:17.530
- It's supposed to be windy.
- For tomorrow...


455
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:20.330
- Where's your dock?
- Excuse me?


456
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:22.230
Your dock?

457
00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:25.630
Oh, it's just around the peninsula,
but on the other side.


458
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.030
The old cottage, with the red dock?

459
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.830
Right.

460
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:31.130
It's very beautiful.

461
00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.430
Well, thank you, we enjoy it.

462
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:37.730
Well, anyway, it's good to see you.
All right, goodbye.


463
00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:46.730
So you're here all week?

464
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:48.730
Well, this week for sure.

465
00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:50.230
Maybe we'll come by tonight.

466
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.230
Oh, do, you know we love seeing you.

467
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:55.130
All right.
We'll see how George is doing.


468
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:57.130
Yeah, see how he is.

469
00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:58.530
Bye-bye.

470
00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.630
- Bye.
- Bye.


471
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:04.830
They'll be here in two hours...

472
00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:07.530
...and then this little charade of yours
will be over.


473
00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:09.230
Sorry, but that's not exactly true.

474
00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:11.630
Didn't you ask your friends to call
and confirm...


475
00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:13.530
...or did I misunderstand something?

476
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:17.130
They'll come,
even if they can't reach us.


477
00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:19.330
Is lying allowed?

478
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:22.930
Just a second.
Wait, let me move this out of the way.


479
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:27.630
Why don't you have a landline?
Don't you find it convenient?


480
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:30.430
Or is it
that you aren't out here that much?


481
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:33.130
Please, have a seat.

482
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:36.430
You know you can be completely
open with us. You'd feel better.


483
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:38.930
We're being completely open with you.

484
00:34:39.930 --> 00:34:41.630
Right there.

485
00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:49.230
You should put a pillow under him.

486
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:52.530
You know, if you'd let Peter
help you, it would hurt less.


487
00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.230
I'm happy to help, really,
I just don't want to impose.


488
00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:57.130
Careful with...

489
00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:02.430
That's a good idea, put it up.
That should be more comfortable.


490
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:05.730
So there we are.

491
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.730
- You sure you don't wanna put a pillow...?
- Could you please stop this?


492
00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:13.330
You're asking?

493
00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:15.030
What?

494
00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:16.330
You said, "Please."

495
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:28.030
I'm very happy about this.

496
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:31.130
It's easier when things are polite.

497
00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.430
I'd like to apologize for before.

498
00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:40.230
But you have to admit, George,
the slap in the face?


499
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:43.530
It really wasn't
the most appropriate reaction.


500
00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:51.430
I'm Paul.

501
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:54.830
This is Peter.

502
00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:58.830
Come here, Tom. Where are
your manners? Shake the man's hand.


503
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:05.530
Here, take this for the pain.

504
00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:07.830
What's this now?
What, are we shit to you?


505
00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:11.230
What, didn't we just agree that?

506
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:14.630
Jesus Christ!

507
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:26.230
It's okay. It's okay.

508
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:29.530
Stop it now,
otherwise your mother will get hurt.


509
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.830
Stop it! Do you understand?
Do you understand?!


510
00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:36.830
Calm down.

511
00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:40.030
Calm down.

512
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:52.730
So much stress for politeness' sake.

513
00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:09.530
I mean, I was
just trying to be friendly.

514
00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:12.530
Improve relations.
I thought we could keep this civilized.


515
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.130
Why are you doing this?

516
00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:20.430
Tubby, why are we doing this?

517
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:24.230
Go on, say it.

518
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:26.830
I don't know.

519
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:30.530
The captain would like to know why.

520
00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:32.830
Well?

521
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:35.930
It's difficult to talk about it.

522
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:37.930
Don't be shy.

523
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:41.630
You know exactly how hard
this is for me.


524
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:43.730
Jesus, what a drama.

525
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:48.130
His father divorced his mother when
he was this big, for another woman...


526
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:51.430
It's not true! He's lying.

527
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:53.830
My mother got a divorce because...

528
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:57.830
Because she wanted her
little teddy bear all to herself.


529
00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:01.330
Which is why he's gay,
and he's a criminal, got it?


530
00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:03.230
You're an asshole.

531
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:04.930
The truth is...

532
00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:09.430
...he's white trash. He comes
from a filthy, deprived family.


533
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:11.730
Five siblings, all of them on drugs.

534
00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:13.630
His father is an alcoholic.

535
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:17.730
His mother, well, I mean,
you can imagine.


536
00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:19.830
Truth is...

537
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:22.230
...he's fucking her.

538
00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:25.730
It's sad, but it's true.

539
00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:30.130
Come on. Calm down now, Tubby.

540
00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:32.630
Stop it.

541
00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:35.530
You're disgusting.

542
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:38.930
Can't you at least watch your language
in front of my son?


543
00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:40.630
Oh, I'm...

544
00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:42.130
I'm sorry.

545
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:44.130
Of course.

546
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:47.430
What would you like to hear?
What would make you happy?


547
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:51.330
None of what I said is true,
you know that as well as I do.


548
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.230
You think he's white trash?

549
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.830
Come on, he's a spoiled little brat.

550
00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:03.030
He's jaded and disgusted
by the emptiness of existence.


551
00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:05.430
It's hard.

552
00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:07.730
Really.

553
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:15.430
He liked that. 
Look, now he's smiling.

554
00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.230
Okay?

555
00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:23.330
You happy now,
or you want another version?


556
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:34.230
I'm hungry.

557
00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:37.130
Let's see what there is.

558
00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:39.630
Truth is...

559
00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:41.630
...he's a drug addict.

560
00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:44.130
That's where he's going to right now.

561
00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:48.830
That's why he's so nervous.
I'm also a drug addict.


562
00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:54.130
We rob rich families in their charming
vacation homes to support our habit.


563
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:57.130
Stop this bullshit.

564
00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:02.430
- I get it. Isn't that enough?
- That's good.


565
00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:07.630
Hey, Tubby, he's got it.
He gets it.


566
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:12.430
That's awesome, really.
Really. Listen...


567
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:14.130
Peter, come here.

568
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:17.030
Listen, we're gonna
make a bet now, okay?


569
00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:19.630
Come on, hurry up.

570
00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:22.930
- Sit down.
- It's dark in here.


571
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:25.130
Come on, don't fall asleep.

572
00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:28.730
Okay, we bet... 
What time is it?

573
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:30.930
Eight-forty.

574
00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:35.630
that in, let's say, 12 hours...

575
00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:37.830
...all three of you...

576
00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:41.230
...are gonna be kaput.

577
00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:42.930
Okay?

578
00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:47.330
What?

579
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:50.230
You bet that you'll be
alive tomorrow at 9:00...


580
00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:53.330
...and we bet
that you'll be dead, okay?


581
00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:09.830
They don't wanna bet.

582
00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:12.730
Well, it's not an option.
There has to be a bet.


583
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:16.130
I mean, what do you think?
You think they stand a chance?


584
00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:19.730
You're on their side, aren't you?
Who are you betting on, hm?


585
00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:22.530
But, wait, what kind of bet is this?
If they're dead...


586
00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:26.530
...they can't live up to their side,
and if they win, they can't live, either.


587
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:29.530
Yes, they'll lose either way,
that's what I'm saying.


588
00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:31.830
Stop this nonsense.
Are you trying to scare us?


589
00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:36.230
Haven't you done enough already?

590
00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:39.730
What do you want? You want money?
Well, take it. I'll tell you what.


591
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:41.830
Take what you want, just get out.

592
00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:43.830
Okay?

593
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:50.330
Don't you think Fred and Eve are going
to come over and see what's happening?


594
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:54.430
And then they're gonna give us
a thorough spanking, right?


595
00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:00.130
Okay.

596
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:02.830
So the bet is on.

597
00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:05.930
Like they say on TV:

598
00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:07.830
Let's make a deal.

599
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:12.330
So, what do you want to do now?

600
00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:17.730
Would you be so kind as to go
and make us something to eat?


601
00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:19.830
Tubby...

602
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:23.530
...I'm worried about you.
Can you control yourself?


603
00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:26.230
You just finished stuffing your face
with that meat.


604
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:29.030
It's disgusting.
What are these people going to think?


605
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:32.530
I haven't had anything since noon.
Stop calling me "Tubby" all the time.


606
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:33.930
- Okay, Tom.
- Okay, Jerry.


607
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:37.730
Okay, well,
I think you should watch your figure.


608
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:40.030
Do you think that that's attractive?

609
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:45.630
Look at the captain's wife.
You think she thinks you're hot?


610
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:46.830
- With these jelly rolls?
- Stop it.


611
00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:49.930
- Do you like having that?
- Stop it.


612
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.030
Look at her, she's not that old.

613
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:58.530
Pardon me, ma'am. You would be
completely acceptable to her...


614
00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:01.330
...if it wasn't for that body.

615
00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:04.230
You should follow her lead.

616
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:08.430
Now, that is a well-toned body.

617
00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:11.930
There's not an extra calorie on it.

618
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:13.430
I'm not so sure.

619
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:15.030
What?

620
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:16.830
Did you hear that?

621
00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:21.630
Tubby, that's really rude.
Are we gonna take that, ma'am?


622
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:25.730
- Oh, no.
- Hey.


623
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:28.230
Indian. You.

624
00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:32.030
What's your name anyway?

625
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:39.030
George.

626
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:42.230
George? Just like Daddy.

627
00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:45.430
That's really sweet.

628
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:47.330
Come here, Georgie.

629
00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:48.730
Come here.

630
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:51.630
Come here.

631
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:54.930
Come on,
we're gonna play a game now.


632
00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:56.830
Leave him alone.

633
00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:00.430
I know you don't want to play with me,
but it's a really awesome game.


634
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:02.830
- It's a fun game, trust me.
- Leave the boy alone.


635
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:05.930
You see how your mom fights for you?

636
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:08.730
- Your daddy could learn from her.
- Stop it.


637
00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:10.930
That's why
we're gonna let her play too.


638
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:13.330
Tubby, take Georgie for a second.

639
00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:17.830
You see, this is an awesome game.
It's called Cat in a Bag.


640
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:20.730
It's really fun. Here we go.

641
00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:24.630
Don't panic. Nothing's going to happen.
I said it was a fun game.


642
00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:29.430
It's a family game. Daddy can play, too,
so he doesn't get bored.


643
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:34.230
Hey, Georgie. It's no fun
if you keep moving around, okay?


644
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:36.430
Hey! Listen to me.

645
00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:40.130
That's better.

646
00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:47.030
Now, listen, we're a team now,
aren't we?


647
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:52.930
Does the cover bother you?

648
00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:55.730
Are you getting enough air?

649
00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:58.130
Are you?

650
00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:01.930
- Georgie? Are you?
- Yes.


651
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:03.730
Awesome.

652
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:05.830
Now we can start.

653
00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:10.830
If I remember correctly, Mommy
and our little Indian wanted to sneak off.


654
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:14.030
Now, why was that?
Tubby, why was that?


655
00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:15.830
I don't know.

656
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:20.230
Is lying allowed? What kind of
example are you setting for these people?


657
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:23.130
Tubby, you know exactly
why she wanted to leave.


658
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:26.430
Because you started talking
about her jelly rolls.


659
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:30.630
You're the one
who's doubted her perfection.


660
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:34.230
Whatever, it doesn't matter.
Anyway...


661
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:39.830
...I understand why she was
embarrassed in front of the boy here.


662
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:43.030
That's why we're playing
Cat in the Bag.


663
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:45.930
To preserve moral decency.

664
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:48.530
Now the kid is in the bag.

665
00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:52.630
Now let's see if Mommy's titties sag.

666
00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:01.330
We don't want to hurt
the kitty-cat, right?


667
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:02.930
Leave him alone.

668
00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:04.830
Exactly. Daddy would like to play too.

669
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:07.730
Oh, God.

670
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:11.730
What are we waiting for?

671
00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:14.630
Tell your wife not to be shy.

672
00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:18.730
It's silly.
I'm sure she doesn't have jelly rolls.


673
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:22.330
Please, leave him alone.

674
00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:26.630
You just have to tell her
to take off her clothes.


675
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:28.230
Please.

676
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:31.730
"Take off your clothes, honey."

677
00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:51.830
Take off your clothes.

678
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:56.530
"Take off your clothes, honey."

679
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:12.030
Take off your clothes, honey.

680
00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:46.630
Bravo.

681
00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:52.430
What did I say? 
No jelly rolls.

682
00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:56.130
And now we can get dressed again.
Thank you.


683
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:25.330
Gross. Tubby, come here.
Take this piglet.


684
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:27.430
He's not even house broken yet.

685
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:29.430
- Go change his diaper.
- I'll take him.


686
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:32.430
It's okay,
I'm not doing anything to him.


687
00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:34.330
Let go of him!

688
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:31.330
Here.

689
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:32.730
Have a seat.

690
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:35.530
Have a seat.

691
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:41.430
I would advise you not to kick.

692
00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:58.730
I hope you don't get bored with him.

693
00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:04.530
If you do,
dump a bucket of water on his head.


694
00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:10.030
But be careful, don't ruin the carpet.

695
00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:38.230
No, it's just a joke.

696
00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:40.430
I have to take my SATs again
in the fall...


697
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:43.430
...and then I'll go to college
and study business.


698
00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:50.730
Does it hurt badly?

699
00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:53.730
Why don't you just kill us?

700
00:51:53.830 --> 00:51:55.830
You shouldn't forget the importance
of entertainment.


701
00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:44.430
I'm sorry about the leg, but it's
really your own fault, if I may say so.


702
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:47.030
I mean, why did you slap Paul?

703
00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:51.230
And the pointless begging for the eggs
was pretty uncomfortable for me.


704
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:52.430
Degrading, actually.

705
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:54.430
I don't know if that's clear to you.

706
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:58.430
If you think about it, all of this,
just for a carton of eggs.


707
00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:01.430
In fact, they must still be there.

708
00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:06.730
Besides, you should've
listened to your wife.


709
00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:09.530
She practically begged you
to let us leave with the eggs.


710
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:13.030
But then, of course,
everyone's always smarter in hindsight.


711
00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:15.030
Here they are.

712
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:18.130
One is cracked, but not bad.

713
00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:21.530
These egg cartons can really
take a lot, considering.


714
00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:25.730
Why are you doing that?
How stupid do you think I am?


715
00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:27.830
I don't understand,
what are you thinking?


716
00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:30.630
You're practically forcing me
to treat you badly.


717
00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:37.630
Shit! Now you've really done it.

718
00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:40.630
And Paul specifically told us
to be careful with the carpet.


719
00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:47.130
Please, just let us go.

720
00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:55.430
Look, you have everything
ahead of you, you're still so young.


721
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:59.030
Nothing's really happened yet.

722
00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:02.730
We can just say George's leg
broke on the boat.


723
00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:06.130
Everyone will believe us,
I promise you.


724
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:08.530
- Please, don't do this.
- Please, just...


725
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:13.730
Why are you degrading yourself?
This is as painful for me as it is for you.


726
00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:47.230
Georgie?

727
00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:50.530
Where are you?

728
00:56:16.930 --> 00:56:18.330
Georgie.

729
00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:20.830
I'm coming.

730
00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:18.330
Wait a second.
I'm gonna play a little music for us.


731
00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:49.730
- Hi, Georgie.
- Don't come any closer.


732
00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:53.430
Cock it.

733
00:57:54.830 --> 00:57:57.030
Pull the handle back.

734
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:27.030
Pull the trigger.

735
00:58:43.930 --> 00:58:47.730
<i>...instead,
urged compromise and said emotions...</i>


736
00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:50.130
<i>- to the museum.
- Oh.</i>


737
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:51.430
<i>You were great!</i>

738
00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:53.930
<i>a good rehearsal.</i>

739
00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:57.430
<i>Damage is mostly along the coast.
The tide in some spots...</i>


740
00:58:57.430 --> 00:59:00.330
<i>his second win
at Talladega Superspeedway.</i>


741
00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:04.330
<i>And trying to do what he has to do
to win the championship.</i>


742
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:07.930
<i>And that means he really needs
to win this race and Iowa...</i>


743
00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:12.330
<i>...and he needs to see Frank Kimble
finish out of the top 26.</i>


744
00:59:12.330 --> 00:59:13.430
<i>That's all he can do.</i>

745
00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:15.230
<i>He does. You had it figured earlier.</i>

746
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:17.430
<i>It can happen.
He knows what he has to do.</i>


747
00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:19.430
<i>He sat on the pole.
He has to win here...</i>


748
00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:22.030
<i>...then go into Iowa
and give it everything he's got.</i>


749
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:24.930
<i>Bobby Gerhart put so much effort
into Superspeedway...</i>


750
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:26.330
Honey, I'm home.

751
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:29.730
Mommy!

752
00:59:29.830 --> 00:59:34.930
What is it, baby?
You're okay, aren't you? Aren't you?


753
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:38.730
They killed Jenny.

754
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:40.830
- Hey, Beavis.
- Hey, Butt-Head.


755
00:59:40.930 --> 00:59:43.030
- Everything under control?
- Looks that way.


756
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:44.530
Good.

757
00:59:45.730 --> 00:59:46.830
May I?

758
00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:49.230
Please, be my guest.

759
00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:54.930
I'm sure you're wondering, captain,
where this hunting rifle came from.


760
00:59:54.930 --> 00:59:56.430
Or does it look familiar?

761
00:59:56.530 --> 00:59:58.830
Did you ever go hunting with Fred?

762
00:59:59.130 --> 01:00:04.330
Can you believe that your darling
little boy just tried to kill me with this?


763
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:07.030
I know it's hard to believe,
but it's the truth...


764
01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:09.730
...and nothing but the truth,
right, Georgie?


765
01:00:13.930 --> 01:00:16.430
- What do you think about that, Tom?
- That's bad.


766
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:18.530
What time is it?

767
01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:19.930
After 11.

768
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:23.730
I think we should think about
winning our bet, don't you?


769
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:27.030
In fact, we should be very grateful
to little Georgie here...


770
01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:30.030
...for helping us out so much.

771
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:32.430
One for Beavis.

772
01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:34.730
One for Butt
-Head.

773
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:38.230
Okay.

774
01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:43.430
<i>Eenie, meenie, minie, mo
Catch the tiger by the toe</i>


775
01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:48.830
<i>If he hollers let him go
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo</i>


776
01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:54.930
You look really blue.

777
01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:57.830
Tell me now, how old are you?

778
01:01:00.830 --> 01:01:02.930
She doesn't wanna play.

779
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:06.430
How old do you think she is?

780
01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:08.330
Thirty, 37?

781
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:11.230
No jelly rolls.

782
01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:16.030
Let's be generous, let's say 35, okay?

783
01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:17.730
You agree?

784
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:19.930
She agrees.

785
01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:22.730
So who do you want to start with?

786
01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:24.330
With her?

787
01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:26.130
Good.

788
01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:29.530
Now, I'll get something to eat.

789
01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:36.730
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven...


790
01:01:50.830 --> 01:01:53.330
Does anyone want anything?

791
01:01:54.830 --> 01:01:56.330
Hm?

792
01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:22.930
You're an idiot, Tubby.

793
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:26.630
You don't kill the person who's
counted out, you kill the one left over.


794
01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:28.730
What's wrong with you?

795
01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:31.030
- He tried to run away.
- So what?


796
01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:33.230
That's no reason to get trigger-happy.

797
01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:36.030
Don't you have any sense of timing?

798
01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:38.030
What time is it?

799
01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:41.230
- Almost 12.
- Shit.


800
01:02:41.330 --> 01:02:43.130
They're spent.

801
01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:48.430
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Okay.


802
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:53.430
Thanks for the driver.
I'm gonna put it back in the bag, okay?


803
01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:55.230
Yes?

804
01:02:55.330 --> 01:03:00.230
- Okay, thanks. Have a nice evening.
- See you.


805
01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:01.930
Ciao.

806
01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:04.430
<i>Juan Montoya gave
a shove to Steve Wallace.</i>


807
01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:09.230
<i>Wallace took over the point, Gerhart
dropped all the way back to ninth.</i>


808
01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:14.830
<i>Blake Bjorklund throwing his name
into the hat as well.</i>


809
01:03:14.830 --> 01:03:19.430
<i>As far as potential drivers
wanting to win here at Talladega...</i>


810
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:24.130
<i>...Pete Shepherd, another development
driver in the 39 for Roush Racing.</i>


811
01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:26.130
<i>Jack Roush
actually made the comment:</i>


812
01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:29.330
<i>"He reminds me
of a young Mark Martin."</i>


813
01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:33.830
<i>Pretty big impressive statement
from Jack Roush. Bob Dillner.</i>


814
01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:36.330
<i>You never know
what's gonna happen on pit road.</i>


815
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:40.030
<i>Pretty funny. Just a second ago,
Brad Parrott ran down here.</i>


816
01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:43.430
<i>You see him right now.
He's in the 61 pit stall...</i>


817
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:46.530
<i>...and that's because
those two are working together.</i>


818
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:49.930
<i>In fact, Juan Montoya
came over the radio and said:</i>


819
01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:54.230
<i>"I am going to stick to the back bumper
of the 61 like glue...</i>


820
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:55.830
<i>...until the white flag."</i>

821
01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:59.430
<i>So Brad Parrott ran down here
to the crew just to explain things...</i>


822
01:03:59.330 --> 01:04:02.130
<i>...and apparently stayed there
just to hang out a little bit.</i>


823
01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:06.130
<i>Well, wait a second,
you can't tell your strategy...</i>


824
01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:08.330
<i>...to the guy you're racing against.</i>

825
01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:10.530
<i>Well, they're saying that now.</i>

826
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:14.630
<i>If the cars get shuffled, that outside line
gets running, they could get busted up.</i>


827
01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:17.630
<i>Juan on the radio minutes ago,
talking to his father, saying:</i>


828
01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:21.030
<i>"Where do I go? The high side,
the low side? What line do I get in?"</i>


829
01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:22.930
<i>Nobody said nothing.</i>

830
01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:03.830
They've gone.

831
01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:15.130
Do you hear that?

832
01:05:20.830 --> 01:05:22.230
They're gone.

833
01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:10.730
I'Il... I'll get a knife.

834
01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:06.830
Calm down.

835
01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:10.530
Just breathe. Please, just breathe.

836
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:14.430
Please, breathe.

837
01:09:14.530 --> 01:09:16.630
Breathe, breathe.

838
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:58.130
We gotta get out of here.

839
01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:08.330
They may come back.

840
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:10.730
We...

841
01:10:12.130 --> 01:10:14.230
We need to go.

842
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:20.430
Okay.

843
01:10:22.230 --> 01:10:24.130
Can you walk?

844
01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:28.530
- I'll help you.
- I'll try.


845
01:10:38.730 --> 01:10:40.530
What is it?

846
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:07.130
Okay.

847
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:13.430
Okay.

848
01:12:02.730 --> 01:12:06.130
Let's go. Please, let's go.

849
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:39.630
It's locked.

850
01:12:42.730 --> 01:12:45.130
We'll have to go through the window.

851
01:12:48.730 --> 01:12:50.630
Oh, God.

852
01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:53.830
George, please, please.

853
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:57.030
I can't, baby. I can't.

854
01:12:57.130 --> 01:13:00.330
Come on. Come on.

855
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:03.730
You go.

856
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:07.330
You go. Okay?

857
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:12.130
If they locked the door,
they probably locked the gate too.


858
01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:14.130
You're right.

859
01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:19.430
Take the pliers, okay?

860
01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:22.830
Cut through the fence.

861
01:13:23.530 --> 01:13:27.830
Be careful when you get to the street,
they might be waiting, okay?


862
01:13:27.730 --> 01:13:29.530
Where are the pliers?

863
01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:32.830
Fuck.

864
01:13:34.730 --> 01:13:36.930
They're in the kitchen, I think.

865
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:38.630
No. In the greenhouse.

866
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:43.130
Hon, please, you got to get dressed,
don't you?


867
01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:47.030
Put some shoes on
because you might have to run.


868
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:49.930
I can't leave you here, no.

869
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:53.430
Just go. We're losing time.

870
01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:58.430
No, wait, the bag's here.
The bag's here, so...


871
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:09.230
I'll hide in the cellar.

872
01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:12.530
Okay? I'll wait for you.

873
01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:17.030
How will you get down there?

874
01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:19.530
I don't know.

875
01:14:19.730 --> 01:14:22.730
- Fuck.
- I'll manage, though.


876
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:36.130
Please, just go.

877
01:14:37.530 --> 01:14:39.030
Please.

878
01:14:58.630 --> 01:15:00.430
George, it's working.

879
01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:04.330
- What?
- It must have dried. It's working again.


880
01:15:04.330 --> 01:15:05.830
Call someone.

881
01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:08.530
- Who?
- The police.


882
01:15:08.930 --> 01:15:10.830
Okay.

883
01:15:21.230 --> 01:15:23.230
It isn't ringing.

884
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:25.630
Let me listen.

885
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:35.430
It's probably still wet.

886
01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:37.630
There's a signal.

887
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:40.430
Wait a minute.

888
01:15:51.230 --> 01:15:52.630
Where's yours?

889
01:15:53.630 --> 01:15:56.030
It's in the fucking car.

890
01:16:23.530 --> 01:16:25.430
Nothing.

891
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:31.630
Get the hair dryer. 
That might work.

892
01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:33.130
Here.

893
01:16:33.730 --> 01:16:36.330
- I need a chair.
- Oh, God.


894
01:16:37.630 --> 01:16:39.630
I'm sorry.

895
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:57.930
It's not working, honey.

896
01:18:28.930 --> 01:18:30.030
Forget it.

897
01:18:30.430 --> 01:18:31.630
Forget it.

898
01:18:31.930 --> 01:18:34.130
Maybe it just doesn't work.

899
01:18:34.830 --> 01:18:36.830
We're wasting time.

900
01:18:37.330 --> 01:18:40.630
Just pull me over
in the chair. I'll try.

901
01:18:40.930 --> 01:18:42.330
Okay?

902
01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:44.130
You got to go now.

903
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:45.830
Okay.

904
01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:50.230
Shit, sorry.

905
01:19:11.230 --> 01:19:12.830
You gotta go.

906
01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:14.930
- Go, now.
- Okay.


907
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:16.030
Please.

908
01:19:16.230 --> 01:19:17.930
Ann.

909
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:23.930
Please forgive me.

910
01:19:38.130 --> 01:19:40.630
I love you.

911
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:45.830
I love you.

912
01:19:46.930 --> 01:19:47.930
I love you.

913
01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:51.130
You run, okay?

914
01:19:51.130 --> 01:19:52.630
Just run.

915
01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:46.730
Hello!

916
01:21:50.730 --> 01:21:52.830
Hello!

917
01:21:52.930 --> 01:21:55.130
Help me!

918
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:57.930
Help!

919
01:22:38.230 --> 01:22:39.830
Hello?

920
01:22:40.530 --> 01:22:43.730
Can you hear me?
This is George Farber.


921
01:22:43.730 --> 01:22:47.930
I live at 55 Neck Lane...

922
01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:50.930
...in the head of the harbor.

923
01:22:53.130 --> 01:22:55.430
They killed my son.

924
01:23:00.130 --> 01:23:02.130
Can you hear me?

925
01:23:04.330 --> 01:23:05.430
Shit.

926
01:23:23.630 --> 01:23:26.930
Hello? I just called.

927
01:25:07.530 --> 01:25:10.130
Hey! Hey!

928
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:12.930
Wait!

929
01:26:43.530 --> 01:26:45.130
Ann?

930
01:27:10.030 --> 01:27:13.030
Player one, level two.

931
01:27:19.230 --> 01:27:20.330
Damn it.

932
01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:22.330
Good morning, captain.

933
01:27:24.230 --> 01:27:25.930
Good morning.

934
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:29.930
They'll be here any minute.

935
01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:33.330
Then we'd better hurry, right, Beavis?

936
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:35.030
How old did we say? 37?

937
01:27:35.130 --> 01:27:36.630
- Thirty-five.
- Okay, 35.


938
01:27:36.630 --> 01:27:39.230
- Why won't you believe me?
- One, two, three...


939
01:27:39.330 --> 01:27:41.530
- It's a good thing the charger's
in the car.


940
01:27:41.630 --> 01:27:44.530
nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15...

941
01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:47.330
If it's her age,
you have to start with her.


942
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:48.330
Why?

943
01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:50.430
Because those are the rules, blockhead.

944
01:27:50.530 --> 01:27:52.730
Okay, well, I'll start with her, then.

945
01:27:52.930 --> 01:27:54.430
The battery wasn't dead yet.

946
01:27:54.630 --> 01:27:57.530
- One, two, three, four...
- Yeah, I know.


947
01:27:57.530 --> 01:28:01.030
It's time to think of something new.
The lady tried that this afternoon.


948
01:28:01.130 --> 01:28:04.030
- Count faster, Beavis.
- Eleven, 12, 13, 14...


949
01:28:04.130 --> 01:28:06.130
I mean,
how primitive do you think we are?


950
01:28:06.130 --> 01:28:09.230
It's not a bet if there's nothing at stake,
right, captain?


951
01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:11.230
I mean, even you need a chance.

952
01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:14.930
The wind blows where it wants to.
That's why sailing is fun.


953
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:17.730
- Twenty-nine, 30, 31, 32...
- Right, isn't it?


954
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:20.930
...33, 34, 35.

955
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:23.430
Now, don't make
the same mistake twice.


956
01:28:23.530 --> 01:28:26.930
It's not the person counted out,
it's the one left over.


957
01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:32.030
Wait a minute.

958
01:28:32.530 --> 01:28:34.230
I see a new toy.

959
01:28:34.330 --> 01:28:36.830
I think we have the lady
to thank for this.


960
01:28:38.930 --> 01:28:41.930
This is gonna make things
a little bit more interesting.


961
01:28:42.630 --> 01:28:45.130
It's boring when mutes suffer.

962
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:49.930
We want to entertain our audience,
right?


963
01:28:49.930 --> 01:28:52.130
Show them what we can do.

964
01:28:58.330 --> 01:29:00.630
You're allowed to play another game.

965
01:29:00.730 --> 01:29:05.030
The name of this game
is The Loving Wife.


966
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:07.330
Otherwise known as:

967
01:29:07.730 --> 01:29:11.230
Whether by Knife
or Whether by Gun...


968
01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:15.330
...Losing Your Life
Can Sometimes Be Fun.


969
01:29:16.330 --> 01:29:18.230
Come on, don't fall asleep.

970
01:29:18.630 --> 01:29:21.230
You have to play,
otherwise I have to gag you again...


971
01:29:21.330 --> 01:29:23.630
...and you don't like that, do you?

972
01:29:25.630 --> 01:29:28.430
So the rules of this game are...

973
01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:31.730
...Georgie Sr. is counted out, okay?

974
01:29:31.630 --> 01:29:34.130
He's up next.
There's nothing to be done about it...


975
01:29:34.230 --> 01:29:36.930
...unless you wanna jump in for him.
Do you?


976
01:29:38.130 --> 01:29:41.230
Do you? Beavis is not gonna mind.
Right, Tubby?


977
01:29:41.230 --> 01:29:43.430
- Don't call me Tubby.
- See, he doesn't mind.


978
01:29:43.530 --> 01:29:46.930
- Just get on with it, this is enough.
- Enough?


979
01:29:47.230 --> 01:29:49.830
You really think it's enough?
What about you, Ann?


980
01:29:49.930 --> 01:29:52.830
Do you think it's enough,
or you wanna keep playing?


981
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:57.230
Don't answer. Let them do
what they want, it'll be over faster.


982
01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:58.930
Oh, come on.

983
01:29:59.430 --> 01:30:01.830
Stop being such a coward.

984
01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:05.830
Do you think it's enough?
I mean, you want a real ending, right?


985
01:30:05.930 --> 01:30:09.830
With plausible plot development,
don't you?


986
01:30:09.930 --> 01:30:12.730
The bet is still on.
You can't cancel it by yourself.


987
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:16.030
So the name of the game
is The Loving Wife.


988
01:30:16.230 --> 01:30:19.230
Now, although Beavis
is already finished counting...


989
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:22.830
...Ann can decide who's up next...

990
01:30:22.730 --> 01:30:25.730
...and with which device.

991
01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:29.830
Which do you prefer?

992
01:30:30.930 --> 01:30:34.630
The little knife or the big gun?

993
01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:38.330
What's the housewife's choice?

994
01:30:40.730 --> 01:30:43.030
You have to admit, Ann...

995
01:30:43.730 --> 01:30:45.930
...I'm being very generous here.

996
01:30:46.230 --> 01:30:50.030
You can prove to your pussy husband
how much you love him.


997
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:55.630
And between friends,
it barely costs you anything.


998
01:30:55.630 --> 01:30:59.230
Doesn't really matter
if you crap out now or later.


999
01:30:59.330 --> 01:31:01.030
Right?

1000
01:31:01.130 --> 01:31:04.230
Hello! Wake up!
What, you're not interested?


1001
01:31:04.230 --> 01:31:09.930
You don't want to play anymore? Beavis,
show her how the game is played. Here.


1002
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:11.530
Watch out.

1003
01:31:11.730 --> 01:31:14.630
- I almost cut myself.
- Really?


1004
01:31:23.230 --> 01:31:27.130
Come on, come on, sit down,
sit down, sit down.


1005
01:31:30.030 --> 01:31:32.130
That's the little knife.

1006
01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:37.530
Ann, you can spare him the pain.

1007
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:41.630
You just... You have to play with us.

1008
01:31:44.730 --> 01:31:47.330
Everything's gonna be fine.

1009
01:31:55.430 --> 01:32:00.230
- What do you want me to do?
- You see, wasn't so difficult.


1010
01:32:03.530 --> 01:32:05.130
Good.

1011
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:10.630
Okay.

1012
01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:13.730
Say a prayer.

1013
01:32:14.530 --> 01:32:15.930
Any one you want.

1014
01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:19.530
If you can say it
without any mistakes...


1015
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:21.730
...then God is on your side...

1016
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:24.930
...and you get to choose
what happens next.


1017
01:32:24.930 --> 01:32:26.430
Okay?

1018
01:32:27.930 --> 01:32:31.530
Okay? Or should we continue
with Georgie Sr?


1019
01:32:37.530 --> 01:32:40.030
I don't know any prayers.

1020
01:32:42.730 --> 01:32:44.930
You don't know any prayers?

1021
01:32:45.530 --> 01:32:47.230
Not even one?

1022
01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:51.430
Is that possible?
Where the...? Where the hell are we?


1023
01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:55.730
- Tubby, tell her one.
- Stop calling me "Tubby" all the time.


1024
01:32:55.730 --> 01:32:57.230
Okay, fine.

1025
01:32:57.730 --> 01:32:59.430
Tell her one.

1026
01:33:02.530 --> 01:33:06.030
<i>I love you, God, with all my might
Keep me safe all through the night</i>


1027
01:33:07.330 --> 01:33:10.830
- That's too short.
- I don't know any others.


1028
01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:12.630
Okay.

1029
01:33:13.330 --> 01:33:17.730
<i>I love you, God, with all my might
Keep me safe all through the night</i>


1030
01:33:19.130 --> 01:33:20.930
<i>I love you, 
God, with all my might...</i>

1031
01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:24.030
No, you can't say it like that.
It's a prayer, Ann.


1032
01:33:24.730 --> 01:33:29.630
You can't just drone on like that.
You're asking the Lord for something...


1033
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:32.930
...so pray properly.

1034
01:33:33.130 --> 01:33:35.730
Come on, get down on your knees.

1035
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:40.430
Yeah, kneel properly.
Put your hands together. That's good.


1036
01:33:40.930 --> 01:33:42.630
Not on your stomach.

1037
01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:47.530
Where's the person you're praying to, hm?
Up there, right? So, pray up there.


1038
01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:49.730
Now, Ann...

1039
01:33:49.730 --> 01:33:53.730
...from the bottom of your heart, pray.

1040
01:33:55.330 --> 01:33:59.430
- Beavis, can you help me out here?
- No!


1041
01:34:00.530 --> 01:34:04.430
Oh, God, I love you, God,
with all my might.


1042
01:34:04.730 --> 01:34:10.030
Please, keep me safe
all through the night, please.


1043
01:34:12.130 --> 01:34:13.730
Bravo.

1044
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:16.630
That was fantastic.

1045
01:34:17.130 --> 01:34:20.630
Okay, that was the test run. Now
we're gonna go for the Olympic Gold.


1046
01:34:20.730 --> 01:34:23.330
If you can say this...

1047
01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:28.430
...little, unfortunately,
much too short of a prayer backwards...


1048
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:30.030
...with no mistakes...

1049
01:34:30.130 --> 01:34:35.030
...not only will you be able to decide
which one of you bites it first...


1050
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:37.930
...but also... And I'm sure this
is gonna interest you more.


1051
01:34:37.930 --> 01:34:39.830
with which device...

1052
01:34:41.130 --> 01:34:44.630
...whether it's the fast
and almost painless big gun...


1053
01:34:44.730 --> 01:34:46.330
...or the slow, drawn-out...

1054
01:34:48.730 --> 01:34:50.530
Look out!

1055
01:35:01.330 --> 01:35:03.030
Shit.

1056
01:35:04.330 --> 01:35:08.630
Where's the remote control?
Where's the fucking remote control?


1057
01:35:38.730 --> 01:35:40.130
Okay, that was the test run.

1058
01:35:40.230 --> 01:35:42.130
Now we're gonna go
for the Olympic Gold.


1059
01:35:42.230 --> 01:35:44.830
If you can say this...

1060
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:49.930
...little, unfortunately,
much too short of a prayer backwards...


1061
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:51.530
...with no mistakes...

1062
01:35:51.630 --> 01:35:56.330
...not only will you be able to decide
which one of you bites it first...


1063
01:35:56.330 --> 01:35:59.430
...but also... And I'm sure
this is gonna interest you even more.


1064
01:35:59.430 --> 01:36:01.230
with which device...

1065
01:36:02.530 --> 01:36:06.030
...whether it's the fast
and almost painless big gun...


1066
01:36:06.130 --> 01:36:07.830
...or the slow, drawn-out...

1067
01:36:13.130 --> 01:36:15.530
You shouldn't have done that, Ann.

1068
01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:18.230
You're not allowed to break the rules.

1069
01:36:19.330 --> 01:36:21.330
I'm sorry.

1070
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:22.930
You failed.

1071
01:36:25.630 --> 01:36:28.030
Say goodbye to Georgie.

1072
01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:17.430
Would you please take a seat?

1073
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:07.930
Give me your gloves.

1074
01:38:13.630 --> 01:38:15.230
So everything
is its mirror image.


1075
01:38:15.230 --> 01:38:18.230
But, of course, all these predictions
are lies to avoid panic.


1076
01:38:18.230 --> 01:38:19.930
Now Kelvin knows what's going on.

1077
01:38:20.130 --> 01:38:22.330
He wants to warn his wife
and daughter in time.


1078
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:25.430
The problem isn't only
how to escape the anti-material world...


1079
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:27.630
...but also how to communicate
between the two worlds.


1080
01:38:27.630 --> 01:38:29.430
- Finally there's a gap...
- Look.


1081
01:38:31.230 --> 01:38:34.430
Now, that is what I call Olympic spirit.

1082
01:38:37.330 --> 01:38:40.430
Hey, Tubby, be careful. Jesus.

1083
01:38:41.230 --> 01:38:43.330
Didn't you say you couldn't swim?

1084
01:38:54.130 --> 01:38:57.030
Bring the widow over here,
otherwise she's gonna get lonely.


1085
01:38:57.130 --> 01:38:59.830
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1086
01:39:00.230 --> 01:39:01.830
Now.

1087
01:39:02.330 --> 01:39:06.530
Help me here, please.
It's difficult, you might get hurt.


1088
01:39:10.730 --> 01:39:13.130
- So where was I?
- There we go.


1089
01:39:13.130 --> 01:39:14.930
You were...

1090
01:39:17.330 --> 01:39:21.030
You were discussing the difference
between communicating...


1091
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:25.330
...between the material universe
and the anti-material universe, right?


1092
01:39:25.330 --> 01:39:27.830
Exactly.
It's like you're inside of a black hole.


1093
01:39:27.930 --> 01:39:30.430
The gravitational force
is so great that nothing...


1094
01:39:30.530 --> 01:39:34.130
...absolutely nothing can escape, which
means absolutely no communication.


1095
01:39:34.030 --> 01:39:35.930
- But Kelvin has this...
- What time is it?


1096
01:39:36.030 --> 01:39:38.830
- What?
- What's the time?


1097
01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:41.830
After 8.

1098
01:39:41.930 --> 01:39:43.630
Already?

1099
01:39:53.330 --> 01:39:55.830
Why? The deadline was 9.
She had almost another hour.


1100
01:39:55.930 --> 01:39:58.430
Well, it's too difficult to sail like this...

1101
01:39:58.530 --> 01:39:59.830
...first of all.

1102
01:39:59.930 --> 01:40:01.630
Second of all...

1103
01:40:02.130 --> 01:40:05.630
- ...I'm getting kind of hungry.
- That's true.


1104
01:40:19.730 --> 01:40:22.230
And when he overcomes
the gravitational forces...


1105
01:40:22.330 --> 01:40:25.930
...it turns out that one universe
is real and the other one is fiction.


1106
01:40:25.930 --> 01:40:27.330
How?

1107
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:30.730
How do I know? It's a kind of
model projection in cyberspace.


1108
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:34.130
Okay, so where's your hero now?
Is he in reality or is he in fiction?


1109
01:40:34.130 --> 01:40:36.730
His family's in reality,
and he's in fiction.


1110
01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:39.630
- But isn't fiction real?
- Why?


1111
01:40:39.730 --> 01:40:42.430
Well, you can see it in the movie,
right?


1112
01:40:42.530 --> 01:40:43.730
Of course.

1113
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:47.830
Well, then it's just as real as reality...

1114
01:40:47.930 --> 01:40:51.230
...because you can see it too, right?

1115
01:40:51.130 --> 01:40:52.930
Bullshit.

1116
01:40:53.130 --> 01:40:54.230
Why?

1117
01:41:34.830 --> 01:41:35.930
Hello?

1118
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:39.330
Is anyone there?

1119
01:41:44.230 --> 01:41:45.930
Hello?

1120
01:41:46.730 --> 01:41:48.530
Yes?

1121
01:41:48.530 --> 01:41:50.230
Hello?

1122
01:41:50.330 --> 01:41:52.430
- Hello.
- Who's there?


1123
01:41:52.530 --> 01:41:57.130
Good morning. I'm sorry
to bother you so early, ma'am.


1124
01:41:57.630 --> 01:41:59.530
Ann sent me.

1125
01:41:59.630 --> 01:42:00.930
Yes?

1126
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:03.230
You don't remember me, do you?

1127
01:42:03.330 --> 01:42:05.730
We met yesterday, at the dock.

1128
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:07.830
- Paul.
- Oh, yes.


1129
01:42:07.930 --> 01:42:09.830
- Good morning.
- Morning.


1130
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:13.530
Ann sent me over because...

1131
01:42:14.130 --> 01:42:15.730
Some guests dropped by...

1132
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:19.230
...and she was wondering if you
could help her out with some eggs.


1133
01:42:19.630 --> 01:42:20.830
Well, I guess so.

1134
01:42:20.830 --> 01:42:23.430
- It's okay?
- Yeah, come on in. Just wait a second.


1135
01:42:23.530 --> 01:42:25.130
Okay.
