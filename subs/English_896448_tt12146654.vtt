00:00:34.422 --> 00:00:35.222
Dad!

3
00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:40.185
Dear God.

4
00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:41.028
Dad?

5
00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:47.869
Dad!

6
00:00:52.072 --> 00:00:52.874
Chloe!

7
00:01:02.382 --> 00:01:03.409
Where's Dad?

8
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:04.544
I don't know.

9
00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:05.745
Dad!

10
00:01:05.787 --> 00:01:06.579
Dad.

11
00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:07.780
It's okay.

12
00:01:07.822 --> 00:01:09.314
Are you okay?

13
00:01:09.356 --> 00:01:10.450
Are you okay?

14
00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:12.392
Oh, you okay?

15
00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:14.420
Where's Dad?

16
00:01:14.462 --> 00:01:15.488
Oh, I don't know.

17
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.622
Dad!

18
00:01:16.664 --> 00:01:17.924
Dad!

19
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:18.800
Dad!

20
00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:21.861
Where has the boat gone?

21
00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:23.170
I don't know.

22
00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:25.205
Dad!

23
00:01:26.541 --> 00:01:27.374
Dad!

24
00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:30.244
Dad!

25
00:01:33.313 --> 00:01:34.649
Oh, thank God.

26
00:01:36.818 --> 00:01:39.412
Are you okay? Are you okay?

27
00:01:39.454 --> 00:01:41.747
Thank God, thank God.

28
00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.382
It's okay, it's okay.

29
00:01:43.424 --> 00:01:44.216
- You okay?
- Yeah.


30
00:01:44.258 --> 00:01:45.050
You okay? Are you okay?

31
00:01:45.092 --> 00:01:45.894
Yes.

32
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.253
Where has the boat gone?

33
00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:50.355
Why would they leave us?

34
00:01:50.397 --> 00:01:52.357
We're gonna get through
this, its' gonna be fine.


35
00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:53.793
It's gonna be fine,
just calm down.


36
00:01:53.835 --> 00:01:55.093
Just calm down.

37
00:01:55.135 --> 00:01:57.772
Stay calm, stay calm. It's okay.

38
00:02:02.443 --> 00:02:04.169
Don't worry, it's gonna be fine.

39
00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:05.872
It's gonna be fine.

40
00:02:05.914 --> 00:02:07.080
Just keep calm.

41
00:02:11.118 --> 00:02:13.646
It's gonna be okay, I promise.

42
00:02:13.688 --> 00:02:16.382
It's gonna be okay,
just keep calm.


43
00:02:16.424 --> 00:02:18.325
They know where we are.

44
00:02:19.494 --> 00:02:22.797
Just, just keep calm,
it's gonna be fine.


45
00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:34.901
Guys, there is
something in the water.


46
00:02:34.943 --> 00:02:36.101
Where? Where?

47
00:02:36.143 --> 00:02:37.737
Over there.

48
00:02:45.853 --> 00:02:46.854
It's okay.

49
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.918
It's okay, just keep
still. It's gonna be fine.


50
00:03:00.768 --> 00:03:01.703
Dad! Dad!

51
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.514
Dad!

52
00:03:19.754 --> 00:03:21.013
Dad!

53
00:03:37.572 --> 00:03:38.405
Lexy?

54
00:03:40.608 --> 00:03:42.001
Lex.

55
00:03:42.043 --> 00:03:42.844
Yeah.

56
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:46.481
How did you sleep? Any better?

57
00:03:47.347 --> 00:03:48.348
Same as always.

58
00:03:50.317 --> 00:03:52.654
Well, I'm going into
town if you wanna come.


59
00:03:54.956 --> 00:03:56.124
You should get out more.

60
00:03:57.592 --> 00:04:00.327
Come on, a little bit of
retail therapy might help.


61
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.997
No, it's okay.

62
00:04:04.297 --> 00:04:05.133
Thanks though.

63
00:04:06.734 --> 00:04:08.159
Okay.

64
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:10.071
Well, I will see you later.

65
00:04:28.288 --> 00:04:29.180
Hello?

66
00:04:29.222 --> 00:04:30.116
Good afternoon,

67
00:04:30.158 --> 00:04:32.392
is Mr. McKenna there, please?

68
00:04:33.695 --> 00:04:34.529
Uh, hello?

69
00:04:36.564 --> 00:04:38.958
I'm calling from Hamptons HiFi.

70
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.960
A while back Mr. McKenna
expressed an interest


71
00:04:41.002 --> 00:04:44.597
in the new range of speakers...

72
00:04:59.454 --> 00:05:00.846
Daddy!

73
00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:20.775
You feeling any
better about things?


74
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:29.316
I have better days, I'm
just tired all the time.


75
00:05:30.051 --> 00:05:31.577
And what about a job?

76
00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:33.855
Have you thought about
anything you could do?


77
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:38.084
And voila!

78
00:05:38.126 --> 00:05:40.619
Now, well, that's
better, isn't it?


79
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:41.887
Thanks.

80
00:05:41.929 --> 00:05:45.099
Mm-hmm, pretty good
if I do say so myself.


81
00:05:46.567 --> 00:05:48.002
Okay, I have gotta run.

82
00:05:54.642 --> 00:05:56.511
So...

83
00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.548
Well, now that your nails
are looking all glamorous,


84
00:06:02.183 --> 00:06:04.384
I was thinking...

85
00:06:06.087 --> 00:06:07.312
No.

86
00:06:07.354 --> 00:06:08.514
Do you want to go to
party with me tonight?


87
00:06:08.556 --> 00:06:11.550
Come on, Lexy,
just a few people.


88
00:06:11.592 --> 00:06:14.319
You know, some
foods, some drinks,


89
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:16.964
maybe Cards Against
Humanity, you love that.


90
00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:20.659
Come on, look, I'll drive,

91
00:06:20.701 --> 00:06:23.529
and then if you really,
are really not enjoying it,


92
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:24.872
I can just bring you home.

93
00:06:26.174 --> 00:06:27.642
Oh, I don't know, I just...

94
00:06:30.343 --> 00:06:31.179
Please?

95
00:06:32.513 --> 00:06:35.641
Please, Lexy.

96
00:06:35.683 --> 00:06:37.143
Just try it.

97
00:06:37.185 --> 00:06:38.019
For me?

98
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.847
I just want the old you back.

99
00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:44.550
You know that fun,
outgoing Lexy.


100
00:06:44.592 --> 00:06:46.393
I know she's in there somewhere.

101
00:06:48.262 --> 00:06:50.856
Please.

102
00:06:50.898 --> 00:06:51.732
Please.

103
00:06:55.736 --> 00:06:56.962
Oh, okay.

104
00:06:57.004 --> 00:07:01.133
Okay, so I
will pick you up at 8:00


105
00:07:01.175 --> 00:07:04.369
and you'll be dressed
and ready, yes?


106
00:07:04.411 --> 00:07:07.406
No lounge wear, okay?

107
00:07:07.448 --> 00:07:09.542
Eight o'clock,
I'll see you later.


108
00:07:09.584 --> 00:07:10.417
- Bye.
- Bye.


109
00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:53.027
Ms. McKenna.

110
00:07:54.495 --> 00:07:58.032
I know this has been
extremely traumatic for you.


111
00:08:00.101 --> 00:08:02.803
Please, in your own time,

112
00:08:04.505 --> 00:08:06.607
tell us what you
remember from that night.


113
00:08:10.912 --> 00:08:11.846
I, uh...

114
00:08:13.014 --> 00:08:16.250
Remember us all being
on the boat, five of us.


115
00:08:19.987 --> 00:08:22.089
It was early evening.

116
00:08:24.225 --> 00:08:28.354
We just opened a bottle of
champagne and we all had some.


117
00:08:28.396 --> 00:08:29.563
Were you celebrating?

118
00:08:30.765 --> 00:08:33.325
No, not exactly.

119
00:08:33.367 --> 00:08:34.201
It was hot,

120
00:08:35.603 --> 00:08:37.838
and we'd been playing
around in the sun all day.


121
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.734
It all went to my head.

122
00:08:41.776 --> 00:08:43.010
The alcohol you mean?

123
00:08:46.047 --> 00:08:47.148
Yeah, um...

124
00:08:50.184 --> 00:08:52.119
And then it was dark.

125
00:08:53.654 --> 00:08:57.625
I vaguely remembered dancing
with my dad, and my sister.


126
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:02.663
Your sister, Chloe.

127
00:09:11.772 --> 00:09:14.842
And then,

128
00:09:17.678 --> 00:09:20.781
I was, I was dancing, I think.

129
00:09:25.353 --> 00:09:28.423
I tripped up, I lost my balance.

130
00:09:33.094 --> 00:09:35.187
Take your time, eh?

131
00:09:35.229 --> 00:09:36.063
It's okay.

132
00:09:46.107 --> 00:09:48.809
They were on the
side of the deck.


133
00:09:55.983 --> 00:09:59.520
I grabbed on to them to
stop myself falling and...


134
00:10:03.924 --> 00:10:08.929
I sent them into
the water with me.


135
00:10:12.366 --> 00:10:14.702
It's all right, it's okay.

136
00:10:16.505 --> 00:10:18.272
It wasn't your fault.

137
00:10:30.317 --> 00:10:32.511
Ms. McKenna, I appreciate

138
00:10:32.553 --> 00:10:34.246
this is extremely
difficult for you,


139
00:10:34.288 --> 00:10:37.384
but you really are helping
us to piece together


140
00:10:37.426 --> 00:10:38.759
the events from that night.

141
00:10:40.161 --> 00:10:44.965
So then all of you, yourself,
your father and sister,


142
00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:48.069
you all fell into the water.

143
00:10:51.305 --> 00:10:53.442
And again, in your own time,

144
00:10:55.544 --> 00:10:57.278
tell us what happened
from then on.


145
00:11:06.821 --> 00:11:07.613
Chloe.

146
00:11:12.393 --> 00:11:13.227
All right?

147
00:11:14.095 --> 00:11:16.722
It's fine, you're okay.

148
00:11:16.764 --> 00:11:17.832
Okay, get on.

149
00:11:20.935 --> 00:11:21.769
All right?

150
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.539
You're okay. Breathe.

151
00:11:25.873 --> 00:11:30.035
All right, now, I need
to go have a look.


152
00:11:30.077 --> 00:11:33.372
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

153
00:11:33.414 --> 00:11:35.049
I'm gonna go under,
I'll be right back.


154
00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:39.446
I won't be long, I promise.

155
00:11:39.488 --> 00:11:42.415
You'll be fine, just
stay, stay here.


156
00:11:42.457 --> 00:11:44.216
- Breathe.
- Okay.


157
00:11:44.258 --> 00:11:45.452
- Yeah?
- Okay.


158
00:11:45.494 --> 00:11:48.120
I'll be right back,
I promise, okay?


159
00:11:48.162 --> 00:11:49.888
Okay.

160
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.398
Just stay still.

161
00:12:30.838 --> 00:12:31.640
Chloe.

162
00:12:34.442 --> 00:12:35.276
Chloe!

163
00:12:41.248 --> 00:12:42.082
Chloe!

164
00:12:44.818 --> 00:12:45.654
Chloe?

165
00:12:46.754 --> 00:12:47.614
I'm here.

166
00:12:47.656 --> 00:12:49.081
Oh, oh my God.

167
00:12:49.123 --> 00:12:50.450
Oh my God.

168
00:12:50.492 --> 00:12:52.226
I thought I lost you.

169
00:13:01.969 --> 00:13:04.305
Did you see where he went?

170
00:13:05.773 --> 00:13:06.608
No.

171
00:14:18.112 --> 00:14:19.639
I'm so excited.

172
00:14:19.681 --> 00:14:24.018
And you look stunning,
you're gonna turn some heads.


173
00:14:25.919 --> 00:14:28.313
You said this
was a small thing.


174
00:14:28.355 --> 00:14:30.291
Yeah, small work-ish.

175
00:14:38.198 --> 00:14:39.434
Lex, come on.

176
00:14:40.301 --> 00:14:42.194
It's all the people you know.

177
00:14:42.236 --> 00:14:46.765
You know Brandon,
except me.


178
00:14:46.807 --> 00:14:49.001
- Come on.
- I can't.


179
00:14:49.043 --> 00:14:50.978
Please, just for a few.

180
00:14:52.313 --> 00:14:56.275
- Please.
- I'm sorry.


181
00:16:02.684 --> 00:16:07.689
Hey gorgeous.

182
00:16:11.258 --> 00:16:14.119
How you doin'?

183
00:16:14.161 --> 00:16:15.996
Sorry, did I wake you?

184
00:16:17.565 --> 00:16:21.603
I'm okay, almost
through another day.


185
00:16:22.771 --> 00:16:24.405
Come here, that's
not the attitude.


186
00:16:25.774 --> 00:16:27.999
It's not getting any easier.

187
00:16:28.041 --> 00:16:29.243
I still can't sleep.

188
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:31.412
Are you having nightmares?

189
00:16:34.381 --> 00:16:36.718
Yeah, you were thrashing
around a lot last night.


190
00:16:40.588 --> 00:16:42.147
Did you get your nails done?

191
00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:43.357
Yeah, Amy did 'em.

192
00:16:44.526 --> 00:16:46.059
Tried to drag me to a party.

193
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.229
Tried?

194
00:16:52.567 --> 00:16:55.969
Yeah, well, maybe next time, eh?

195
00:16:58.372 --> 00:17:02.167
Hey, I know something
that will cheer you up.


196
00:17:02.209 --> 00:17:03.277
I brought us Chinese.

197
00:17:04.446 --> 00:17:06.748
Come on, you're always
in the mood for Chinese.


198
00:17:09.851 --> 00:17:10.685
Yeah?

199
00:17:11.886 --> 00:17:12.911
Okay.

200
00:17:12.953 --> 00:17:14.279
Come on.

201
00:17:18.493 --> 00:17:19.585
Hi.

202
00:17:19.627 --> 00:17:21.788
Hi Amy, you all right?

203
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:22.988
I'm good, you?

204
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:26.091
Yeah, not too
bad. Can't complain.


205
00:17:26.133 --> 00:17:27.325
Life goes on.

206
00:17:27.367 --> 00:17:28.202
Yeah.

207
00:17:31.205 --> 00:17:32.698
Does she know you're coming?

208
00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.534
Oh, no, I don't bother
texting her anymore.


209
00:17:34.576 --> 00:17:36.669
I know she's more
likely to say no.


210
00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:38.170
Yeah, makes sense.

211
00:17:38.212 --> 00:17:39.439
I mean, I hope you don't
mind me just turning up.


212
00:17:39.481 --> 00:17:40.873
I would hate to intrude.

213
00:17:40.915 --> 00:17:42.475
Oh no, no, not at all.

214
00:17:42.517 --> 00:17:44.075
I mean, it looks like she's
here for the long haul.


215
00:17:44.117 --> 00:17:46.746
So it's her house
as much as mine.


216
00:17:46.788 --> 00:17:47.689
I suppose it is.

217
00:17:49.424 --> 00:17:52.083
Well, anyway, I'm off
out for a prescription.


218
00:17:52.125 --> 00:17:54.921
So she's in the lounge.

219
00:17:54.963 --> 00:17:55.797
Thanks.

220
00:18:01.503 --> 00:18:02.929
Hi.

221
00:18:02.971 --> 00:18:05.540
Not disturbing anything, am I?

222
00:18:07.475 --> 00:18:09.878
What's that? Daytime quiz shows?

223
00:18:10.845 --> 00:18:12.680
Hmm, have you learnt much?

224
00:18:14.248 --> 00:18:16.651
Figs contained dead wasps.

225
00:18:18.018 --> 00:18:20.655
That's disgusting.

226
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:23.825
Where did your nails go?

227
00:18:26.561 --> 00:18:28.095
You scratched them all off.

228
00:18:29.564 --> 00:18:30.965
I'm sorry.

229
00:18:32.734 --> 00:18:34.192
No, it's okay.

230
00:18:34.234 --> 00:18:36.638
They're your nails, you do
what you like with them.


231
00:18:38.272 --> 00:18:42.300
Just glad I didn't go to
the trouble of waxing you.


232
00:18:42.342 --> 00:18:45.713
Look, there it is, there is
that winning smile of yours.


233
00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.355
Lex, listen.

234
00:18:58.292 --> 00:18:59.259
Babe, look at me.

235
00:19:05.232 --> 00:19:06.901
I've been thinking, and,

236
00:19:08.402 --> 00:19:11.071
I've seen you over the
past couple of months and,


237
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.367
I don't think you're
getting any better.


238
00:19:15.409 --> 00:19:16.678
And after last night,

239
00:19:19.047 --> 00:19:21.248
look, I really think
it would be a good idea


240
00:19:23.317 --> 00:19:25.118
if you spoke to someone,

241
00:19:27.254 --> 00:19:28.656
got some therapy,

242
00:19:31.693 --> 00:19:33.586
I don't know.

243
00:19:33.628 --> 00:19:35.964
I've done some research,

244
00:19:37.097 --> 00:19:38.733
and I found out that the NHS,

245
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.929
they offer counseling
for people with PTSD.


246
00:19:42.971 --> 00:19:45.565
I think that's
what you have, Lex.


247
00:19:45.607 --> 00:19:47.165
I know it's soldiers
that often get it,


248
00:19:47.207 --> 00:19:48.743
but your symptoms are the same.

249
00:19:49.944 --> 00:19:52.304
I really think you
should speak to someone.


250
00:19:52.346 --> 00:19:54.339
Right, do you remember Jason?

251
00:19:54.381 --> 00:19:55.608
Yeah, the guy who
was in the car crash


252
00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.108
when his friends died?

253
00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:00.479
I heard he had counseling and
it really helped him, Lexy.


254
00:20:00.521 --> 00:20:03.049
I'll even drive you
to the sessions.


255
00:20:03.091 --> 00:20:05.392
I just, I really think
you should consider it.


256
00:20:08.896 --> 00:20:11.633
Baby, you need to
speak to someone.


257
00:20:13.935 --> 00:20:14.794
Please.

258
00:20:17.472 --> 00:20:20.808
Look, I'll pass you
on the details, okay?


259
00:20:25.379 --> 00:20:26.213
Please.

260
00:20:30.485 --> 00:20:33.012
So I'm thinking
about seeing a shrink.


261
00:20:33.054 --> 00:20:34.513
Really?

262
00:20:34.555 --> 00:20:36.024
What's made you decide that?

263
00:20:37.125 --> 00:20:38.092
Amy suggested it.

264
00:20:39.093 --> 00:20:40.352
I had to wait ages for them

265
00:20:40.394 --> 00:20:41.821
to even get back to
me about my physio.


266
00:20:41.863 --> 00:20:45.357
And then it was six months
before there was an appointment.


267
00:20:45.399 --> 00:20:46.868
They really weren't very good.

268
00:20:48.201 --> 00:20:50.096
Yeah, all they're
gonna do is just,


269
00:20:50.138 --> 00:20:51.296
tell you what you wanna hear,

270
00:20:51.338 --> 00:20:52.832
feed you these little white lies

271
00:20:52.874 --> 00:20:54.642
that just make you
feel better, but,


272
00:20:55.843 --> 00:20:57.703
I mean they can't
change the past.


273
00:20:57.745 --> 00:21:00.205
You can't change
what's happened, Lex.


274
00:21:00.247 --> 00:21:02.817
They'll probably just
put you on more medication.


275
00:21:04.952 --> 00:21:06.512
Hey, but it's,
it's your choice.


276
00:21:06.554 --> 00:21:08.981
If you want to go for it,
we are right behind you.


277
00:21:09.023 --> 00:21:12.317
But in my opinion,

278
00:21:12.359 --> 00:21:14.696
the greatest healer is time.

279
00:21:36.451 --> 00:21:37.452
I'm sorry.

280
00:21:42.123 --> 00:21:42.924
So sorry.

281
00:22:20.228 --> 00:22:22.521
Hello,
welcome to The Oaks.


282
00:22:22.563 --> 00:22:26.125
Our working hours are nine
to five, Monday to Friday.


283
00:22:26.167 --> 00:22:28.661
Please call back then
or leave a message


284
00:22:28.703 --> 00:22:30.638
and we'll try to get
back to you soon.


285
00:22:45.418 --> 00:22:46.254
Hey.

286
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:50.585
Come in.

287
00:23:52.153 --> 00:23:53.479
Hi.

288
00:23:53.521 --> 00:23:54.780
Lex?

289
00:23:54.822 --> 00:23:55.623
Yeah.

290
00:23:56.691 --> 00:23:58.059
Please take a seat.

291
00:24:07.468 --> 00:24:09.136
You don't like doors being shut.

292
00:24:10.471 --> 00:24:12.006
Don't worry, it's quite common.

293
00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.867
I'll just leave it ajar,

294
00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:17.044
that way you won't feel
like you're being closed in.


295
00:24:18.411 --> 00:24:20.105
, isn't it?

296
00:24:20.147 --> 00:24:21.115
Yeah, thanks.

297
00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:30.424
So, thank you for
coming to see me.


298
00:24:31.959 --> 00:24:34.862
My name is Francesca,
but you can call me Fran.


299
00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:38.190
And you are Lex?

300
00:24:38.232 --> 00:24:40.067
Yeah, or Lexy, whichever.

301
00:24:41.002 --> 00:24:43.429
Short for Alexandra?

302
00:24:43.471 --> 00:24:44.305
Yeah.

303
00:24:45.473 --> 00:24:47.800
There was a boy in my
first year called Alex,


304
00:24:47.842 --> 00:24:49.577
so I was Lexy since then.

305
00:24:50.845 --> 00:24:53.214
So now we know
each other's names.


306
00:24:54.949 --> 00:24:57.818
I'd like you to perhaps tell
me a little bit about you.


307
00:24:58.819 --> 00:25:00.354
Maybe a bit about your family.

308
00:25:02.456 --> 00:25:03.291
Okay.

309
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.163
We moved to the US when
I was pretty young.


310
00:25:11.032 --> 00:25:12.466
My dad got a job.

311
00:25:13.734 --> 00:25:17.162
We were there years, I
mean, we grew up there.


312
00:25:17.204 --> 00:25:19.031
Long story short, we came back.

313
00:25:19.073 --> 00:25:22.310
My mom never really felt
at home there, you know?


314
00:25:25.746 --> 00:25:27.214
And then she...

315
00:25:33.854 --> 00:25:34.689
It's okay.

316
00:25:36.023 --> 00:25:40.061
I know it's hard, but
it's good to talk.


317
00:25:44.732 --> 00:25:48.494
Mom died about three years
ago from a brain tumor,


318
00:25:48.536 --> 00:25:50.104
was very sudden.

319
00:25:52.239 --> 00:25:55.000
I just think those things
happen to other people.


320
00:25:55.042 --> 00:25:56.410
It was such a shock.

321
00:25:57.845 --> 00:25:58.679
Sorry.

322
00:26:00.548 --> 00:26:02.942
Dad stayed so strong.

323
00:26:02.984 --> 00:26:04.318
I don't know how he did it.

324
00:26:29.777 --> 00:26:34.015
Your mom would've been
so proud of you two today.


325
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.184
I'm proud of you.

326
00:26:40.888 --> 00:26:42.723
You're both so strong.

327
00:26:46.527 --> 00:26:50.097
This will go by now,
strong for each other.


328
00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:54.893
Become better people
'cause that's what we are,


329
00:26:54.935 --> 00:26:57.129
we're good people.

330
00:26:57.171 --> 00:26:59.840
We will get through it, I swear.

331
00:27:06.147 --> 00:27:08.883
It's gonna be hard
for all of us.


332
00:27:10.151 --> 00:27:11.844
But we'll grow stronger for it.

333
00:27:11.886 --> 00:27:14.388
He was the most selfless
person I've ever known.


334
00:27:15.289 --> 00:27:16.757
He always put us first.

335
00:27:19.461 --> 00:27:20.861
I wish I could've met him.

336
00:27:23.764 --> 00:27:25.467
Shall we take a quick break?

337
00:27:27.802 --> 00:27:28.836
Do you fancy a cuppa?

338
00:27:30.838 --> 00:27:32.474
How about a biscuit?

339
00:27:35.376 --> 00:27:40.381
I bet you're a chocolate
bourbon kind of girl.


340
00:27:42.383 --> 00:27:43.275
Custard scream.

341
00:27:43.317 --> 00:27:46.253
Ooh, my own personal favorite.

342
00:27:47.121 --> 00:27:49.348
So we have a bit more time.

343
00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:51.850
I'd like to move on to
the events of the day


344
00:27:51.892 --> 00:27:52.927
if that's all right.

345
00:27:54.161 --> 00:27:56.021
You don't have to go
into too much detail,


346
00:27:56.063 --> 00:27:59.492
maybe just a bit about
who you were with,


347
00:27:59.534 --> 00:28:01.669
the way you were,
that sort of thing.


348
00:28:03.337 --> 00:28:07.032
We were in South Africa on
our first family vacation,


349
00:28:07.074 --> 00:28:09.001
since dad remarried.

350
00:28:09.043 --> 00:28:10.512
- What was her name?
- Vicky


351
00:28:12.713 --> 00:28:15.641
Dad actually wanted to
go to the Caribbean.


352
00:28:15.683 --> 00:28:18.677
Vicky wanted South Africa,
that's why we went there.


353
00:28:18.719 --> 00:28:20.254
And where did you want to go?

354
00:28:21.889 --> 00:28:23.483
Oh, I don't know.

355
00:28:23.525 --> 00:28:28.120
Maybe the Caribbean, I
didn't mind it.


356
00:28:28.162 --> 00:28:31.156
Vicky insisted that
my boyfriend came too.


357
00:28:31.198 --> 00:28:32.324
Your boyfriend?

358
00:28:32.366 --> 00:28:34.159
Yeah, Isaac.

359
00:28:34.201 --> 00:28:38.139
We'd been together about
six months at the time.


360
00:28:39.206 --> 00:28:40.841
Dad really liked him.

361
00:28:41.842 --> 00:28:43.202
So five of you then.

362
00:28:43.244 --> 00:28:45.438
One day we chartered a boat,

363
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.816
a small cruiser,
nothing too fancy.


364
00:28:49.984 --> 00:28:51.886
Isaac has a license,
so he took us out.


365
00:28:53.254 --> 00:28:55.055
It was such a beautiful day.

366
00:28:57.158 --> 00:29:00.786
We played around in one
of those inflatable boats


367
00:29:00.828 --> 00:29:01.862
off the side,

368
00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:08.035
had a few drinks.

369
00:29:20.414 --> 00:29:21.248
Lex.

370
00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:23.284
Lex.

371
00:29:24.919 --> 00:29:26.187
Was it really that bad?

372
00:29:28.689 --> 00:29:31.850
Yeah, well I'm sure it's gonna
be difficult to start with.


373
00:29:31.892 --> 00:29:33.852
You did have a pretty traumatic
event happen to you so...


374
00:29:33.894 --> 00:29:35.196
I know, I was there.

375
00:29:41.135 --> 00:29:41.969
Sorry.

376
00:29:43.404 --> 00:29:46.098
Just, you just
gotta stick at it.


377
00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.066
Don't let the first
session put you off.


378
00:29:48.108 --> 00:29:49.511
They're only trying to help.

379
00:29:51.212 --> 00:29:52.681
Come on, let's go.

380
00:30:14.068 --> 00:30:15.861
You were gone a long time.

381
00:30:15.903 --> 00:30:17.262
Did you go anywhere nice?

382
00:30:17.304 --> 00:30:19.139
For a picnic.

383
00:30:20.174 --> 00:30:21.008
A picnic?

384
00:30:22.042 --> 00:30:23.235
On your own.

385
00:30:23.277 --> 00:30:24.504
No, with Amy.

386
00:30:24.546 --> 00:30:26.338
She had the day off.

387
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.617
A little bit chilly
for a picnic, isn't it?


388
00:30:31.151 --> 00:30:35.256
She brought hot
chocolate, so it was okay.


389
00:30:36.757 --> 00:30:37.950
Yeah, this takes the edge off.

390
00:30:37.992 --> 00:30:39.419
Can I have some wine?

391
00:30:39.461 --> 00:30:41.554
I thought you couldn't
have it with your medication.


392
00:30:41.596 --> 00:30:43.088
I stopped taking it.

393
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:45.023
But didn't the doctor say
to carry on for a lil' longer?


394
00:30:45.065 --> 00:30:50.037
I did, for two months.

395
00:30:54.108 --> 00:30:56.343
Are you gonna pour
one for me and Isaac?


396
00:30:58.245 --> 00:30:59.614
Yeah, sorry.

397
00:31:01.449 --> 00:31:02.283
There he is.

398
00:31:04.552 --> 00:31:05.744
Drinking wine?

399
00:31:05.786 --> 00:31:06.878
Seems that I am?

400
00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.581
Whoa, go easy.

401
00:31:08.623 --> 00:31:12.059
You know the effect
it can have on you.


402
00:31:21.636 --> 00:31:23.161
Thanks, Vicks,
it was delicious.


403
00:31:23.203 --> 00:31:25.839
You're welcome.
How was your day?


404
00:31:26.807 --> 00:31:28.900
Yeah, pretty good actually.

405
00:31:28.942 --> 00:31:30.670
I had a meeting
with a new client.


406
00:31:30.712 --> 00:31:32.505
They weren't sure the
deal was gonna go through


407
00:31:32.547 --> 00:31:35.550
but I went in, cranked the
old charm, and job done.


408
00:31:36.484 --> 00:31:37.744
Well done.

409
00:31:37.786 --> 00:31:38.952
Knew you had it in you.

410
00:31:43.157 --> 00:31:44.325
How was your day, Lex?

411
00:31:45.292 --> 00:31:46.894
She went for a
picnic with Amy.


412
00:31:49.196 --> 00:31:49.997
A picnic?

413
00:31:52.467 --> 00:31:53.258
In this weather?

414
00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:54.868
That's what I said.

415
00:31:56.236 --> 00:31:57.397
Must be pretty tramautic

416
00:31:57.439 --> 00:31:58.372
the way you're
drinking that wine.


417
00:32:11.952 --> 00:32:13.788
Time for bed, madam.

418
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.453
You're gonna regret that
second bottle of wine


419
00:32:20.495 --> 00:32:21.328
in the morning.

420
00:32:54.496 --> 00:32:58.899
Not tonight. I'm
knackered, okay?


421
00:33:01.168 --> 00:33:02.695
You're drunk.

422
00:33:02.737 --> 00:33:04.204
Maybe tomorrow, eh?

423
00:33:05.607 --> 00:33:06.441
Yeah.

424
00:33:09.711 --> 00:33:12.805
Get some sleep, you're drunk?

425
00:33:12.847 --> 00:33:13.681
Goodnight.

426
00:33:19.086 --> 00:33:22.013
So last week, we
talked a bit about your family


427
00:33:22.055 --> 00:33:25.350
and later on in the afternoon
you started drinking.


428
00:33:25.392 --> 00:33:26.226
Yeah.

429
00:33:27.429 --> 00:33:29.396
What time
is that? Five-ish?


430
00:33:30.432 --> 00:33:31.691
Yeah, probably.

431
00:33:31.733 --> 00:33:34.001
And whose idea was
it to start drinking?


432
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:37.963
I don't know.

433
00:33:38.005 --> 00:33:39.565
We had a ton of
drinks in the ice box,


434
00:33:39.607 --> 00:33:41.476
so it was gonna
happen at some point.


435
00:33:42.744 --> 00:33:45.379
And would you say that
you usually drunk a lot?


436
00:33:46.581 --> 00:33:48.783
Well, I wasn't long
out of university, so.


437
00:33:50.685 --> 00:33:51.886
I remember those days.

438
00:33:55.088 --> 00:33:59.852
So you were all having
fun on the boat.


439
00:33:59.894 --> 00:34:00.662
Yeah.

440
00:34:02.196 --> 00:34:05.834
Dad likes, liked
to have a party.


441
00:35:05.259 --> 00:35:10.264
Oh my God,
how much have you drunk?


442
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:17.605
Wait, oh, hey, wait.

443
00:35:18.806 --> 00:35:20.542
- What was that?
- What?


444
00:35:22.443 --> 00:35:24.537
Do they have dolphins here?

445
00:35:24.579 --> 00:35:25.412
Why?

446
00:35:27.347 --> 00:35:29.283
I'm sure I saw a fin.

447
00:35:32.987 --> 00:35:35.548
Get us out! Get us out!

448
00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:37.683
Get us out! Get us out!

449
00:35:58.479 --> 00:35:59.872
Lex.

450
00:35:59.914 --> 00:36:02.382
Lex, listen. Look at me.

451
00:36:05.385 --> 00:36:08.155
I can see that you
blame yourself.


452
00:36:10.157 --> 00:36:11.759
Sometimes things just happen.

453
00:36:12.894 --> 00:36:14.394
There's no reason for it.

454
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:19.500
Universe is just a
series of random events.


455
00:36:24.806 --> 00:36:25.873
It was my fault.

456
00:36:29.811 --> 00:36:31.946
It was my fault we
fell in the water.


457
00:36:33.648 --> 00:36:36.509
It's my fault they're dead.

458
00:36:36.551 --> 00:36:38.318
Please don't think like that.

459
00:36:40.822 --> 00:36:42.991
You're here, you survived.

460
00:36:45.693 --> 00:36:47.260
Sometimes I wish I didn't.

461
00:37:01.476 --> 00:37:03.069
Okay?

462
00:37:03.111 --> 00:37:04.070
Thanks.

463
00:37:04.112 --> 00:37:05.504
Anytime.

464
00:37:05.546 --> 00:37:07.873
Don't give up now, I'm
sure you're making progress


465
00:37:07.915 --> 00:37:09.517
even if it doesn't seem like it.

466
00:37:11.218 --> 00:37:12.053
Okay?

467
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:19.885
Amy.

468
00:37:19.927 --> 00:37:21.286
Jesus.

469
00:37:21.328 --> 00:37:22.162
Not quite.

470
00:37:23.097 --> 00:37:24.757
What are you up to?

471
00:37:24.799 --> 00:37:26.859
Oh, nothing much,
just a bit of gardening.


472
00:37:26.901 --> 00:37:28.102
I had the afternoon off.

473
00:37:29.904 --> 00:37:32.006
How was your picnic
the other week?


474
00:37:33.141 --> 00:37:35.333
Picnic?

475
00:37:35.375 --> 00:37:39.170
Yeah, Lex said you went
on a picnic last week.


476
00:37:39.212 --> 00:37:40.171
No, I...

477
00:37:40.213 --> 00:37:42.416
Oh, sorry, the picnic.

478
00:37:43.584 --> 00:37:45.285
Yeah, it was, it
was good, thanks.


479
00:37:48.923 --> 00:37:49.857
Where'd you go?

480
00:37:50.725 --> 00:37:53.326
Just somewhere local, a park.

481
00:37:54.327 --> 00:37:55.163
What'd you eat?

482
00:37:56.564 --> 00:38:00.325
Sandwiches, nibbles,
you know, picnics things.


483
00:38:00.367 --> 00:38:01.259
What kind of sandwiches?

484
00:38:01.301 --> 00:38:02.728
Look, I'm really sorry.

485
00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:06.499
I've got to head off, so
I'll catch you later, okay?


486
00:38:06.541 --> 00:38:07.374
Okay.

487
00:38:08.509 --> 00:38:09.342
Bye.

488
00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:16.776
Ms. McKenna, I'm
going to show you


489
00:38:16.818 --> 00:38:18.318
a couple of photographs.

490
00:38:20.088 --> 00:38:23.091
This is the dinghy the Coast
Guard found you clinging to.


491
00:38:26.226 --> 00:38:28.286
Do you recognize this dinghy?

492
00:38:28.328 --> 00:38:30.923
Yeah, it's from the boat.

493
00:38:30.965 --> 00:38:33.859
And you and the
other people on board


494
00:38:33.901 --> 00:38:36.269
were playing in this
inflatable during the day?


495
00:39:22.917 --> 00:39:24.110
Do you recall how the dinghy

496
00:39:24.152 --> 00:39:25.720
came to be in the
water at night?


497
00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:32.760
I think Isaac or Vicky
threw it in to help.


498
00:40:14.168 --> 00:40:15.628
Hey, babe.

499
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:16.896
Look, I'm really sorry,
I've got to cover a shift


500
00:40:16.938 --> 00:40:19.732
at work today, so I
can't drive you in.


501
00:40:19.774 --> 00:40:22.635
Maybe see if Vicky can.

502
00:40:22.677 --> 00:40:23.869
Look, I've gotta go.

503
00:40:23.911 --> 00:40:25.646
I'll catch up with you
later.


504
00:40:37.325 --> 00:40:38.684
You know, if you've
got health problems


505
00:40:38.726 --> 00:40:40.561
you can talk to me
about it, you know.


506
00:40:41.796 --> 00:40:44.322
Whatever it is, I've
probably had it myself


507
00:40:44.364 --> 00:40:47.034
or at least had experience
talking to people about it.


508
00:40:48.469 --> 00:40:50.162
Come on, I'm all ears.

509
00:40:50.204 --> 00:40:51.530
It's nothing, I'm fine.

510
00:40:51.572 --> 00:40:53.474
- It's just a checkup.
- For what?


511
00:40:54.609 --> 00:40:56.310
A scan, it's nothing.

512
00:40:58.446 --> 00:41:01.907
All right, well, you know
where I am if you need me.


513
00:41:01.949 --> 00:41:02.783
Thanks.

514
00:41:04.452 --> 00:41:05.444
You're not pregnant, are you?

515
00:41:05.486 --> 00:41:08.581
Oh God. No, definitely not.

516
00:41:08.623 --> 00:41:09.457
Good.

517
00:41:19.934 --> 00:41:22.595
There maybe another reason

518
00:41:22.637 --> 00:41:24.238
why you reached for the alcohol.

519
00:41:25.339 --> 00:41:27.800
It's common for
people who've suffered


520
00:41:27.842 --> 00:41:31.103
a traumatic experience
like you did,


521
00:41:31.145 --> 00:41:33.371
for them to try and
recreate that experience


522
00:41:33.413 --> 00:41:36.275
in order to prove to themselves

523
00:41:36.317 --> 00:41:37.919
that they could stay in control.

524
00:41:38.786 --> 00:41:40.121
It's forward catharsis.

525
00:41:41.555 --> 00:41:44.783
Now it's possible that you
have reached for the alcohol


526
00:41:44.825 --> 00:41:48.262
to try and prove to yourself
that you can stay in control.


527
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:53.926
And that maybe there was
another element that meant


528
00:41:53.968 --> 00:41:57.229
that it wasn't your fault
like you've so far believed.


529
00:41:57.271 --> 00:41:59.932
What, so you think there's
something more to it?


530
00:41:59.974 --> 00:42:02.101
I'm suggesting there
might be another reason


531
00:42:02.143 --> 00:42:04.812
why you started drinking again.

532
00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.716
I mean, you told me you could
handle your drink in the past.


533
00:42:12.386 --> 00:42:14.613
You told me that
it was a hot day


534
00:42:14.655 --> 00:42:16.982
and you were expending
plenty of energy


535
00:42:17.024 --> 00:42:20.227
swimming, having
fun in the dinghy.


536
00:42:21.696 --> 00:42:23.698
It's possible that
you were lightheaded,


537
00:42:24.632 --> 00:42:26.859
dehydrated, thirsty.

538
00:42:26.901 --> 00:42:29.194
You had a couple of
glasses of champagne.


539
00:42:29.236 --> 00:42:32.831
Now the bubbles make
the blood absorb


540
00:42:32.873 --> 00:42:34.241
the alcohol more quickly.

541
00:42:35.609 --> 00:42:38.112
I know if it was me I'd be
more than a little lightheaded.


542
00:42:39.747 --> 00:42:43.142
Possibly, but I still
never black out like that.


543
00:42:43.184 --> 00:42:46.946
Even when I'm really wasted,
I remember everything.


544
00:42:46.988 --> 00:42:49.424
Even when I don't want
to, it's kind of annoying.


545
00:42:50.591 --> 00:42:52.893
Well, there's a first
time for everything.


546
00:42:55.663 --> 00:42:57.256
Happens to most
drinkers eventually,


547
00:42:57.298 --> 00:43:00.059
although there is usually
a combination of things


548
00:43:00.101 --> 00:43:02.303
which would make you black out.

549
00:43:09.744 --> 00:43:11.446
There was something
in my drink.


550
00:43:13.214 --> 00:43:15.983
You think your drink
may have been spiked.


551
00:43:16.917 --> 00:43:18.143
Maybe.

552
00:43:18.185 --> 00:43:19.778
Well, that is a
strong statement.


553
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:21.814
I mean, do you have
any reason to think


554
00:43:21.856 --> 00:43:23.591
that anyone would
try and drug you?


555
00:43:24.959 --> 00:43:27.886
No, Dad would never.

556
00:43:27.928 --> 00:43:30.255
Chloe wouldn't,
not even as a joke.


557
00:43:30.297 --> 00:43:31.424
Isaac would have no need to,

558
00:43:31.466 --> 00:43:33.134
we were actually
having sex back then.


559
00:43:34.301 --> 00:43:35.995
And Vicky, I...

560
00:43:36.037 --> 00:43:37.596
Would you
have had any reason


561
00:43:37.638 --> 00:43:39.898
to believe that Vicky would?

562
00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:41.434
No.

563
00:43:41.476 --> 00:43:44.745
Okay, well, let's go over
it again with that in mind.


564
00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.340
Where have you been?
I was waiting for you.


565
00:44:21.382 --> 00:44:22.574
I'm sorry, I needed a walk.

566
00:44:22.616 --> 00:44:24.285
Well, you could have
answered your phone.


567
00:44:31.258 --> 00:44:33.952
What? How did we get here?

568
00:44:33.994 --> 00:44:35.329
What's going on?

569
00:44:36.797 --> 00:44:38.090
I don't know.

570
00:44:38.132 --> 00:44:39.568
Where's the boat?

571
00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:42.294
It's over there. Help!

572
00:44:42.336 --> 00:44:43.295
- Hey!
- Hey!


573
00:44:43.337 --> 00:44:44.171
Help!

574
00:44:47.141 --> 00:44:48.567
We need help over here!

575
00:44:48.609 --> 00:44:49.402
Help!

576
00:44:49.444 --> 00:44:50.403
Help!

577
00:44:50.445 --> 00:44:51.937
- Get us out!
- Over here!


578
00:45:00.988 --> 00:45:02.515
- Where is he!
- Dad!


579
00:45:02.557 --> 00:45:05.284
Where is he? Where is he?

580
00:45:05.326 --> 00:45:06.160
Dad!

581
00:45:09.431 --> 00:45:12.392
- One, Lexy?
- No, thanks.


582
00:45:12.434 --> 00:45:13.692
Probably a good idea.

583
00:45:13.734 --> 00:45:15.227
You were snoring
a bit last night.


584
00:45:15.269 --> 00:45:19.098
Hey, you oughta
get a lil' crack at that gym.


585
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:20.442
You celebrate?

586
00:45:24.945 --> 00:45:28.215
You know, that
night in South Africa.


587
00:45:30.452 --> 00:45:31.610
You mean...

588
00:45:31.652 --> 00:45:33.020
The night my dad
and Chloe were killed.


589
00:45:35.557 --> 00:45:36.390
Yeah.

590
00:45:38.392 --> 00:45:40.495
Can you remind me
what happened exactly?


591
00:45:42.163 --> 00:45:43.655
I just want to
clarify a few things.


592
00:45:43.697 --> 00:45:45.933
I know I was drinking a lot and,

593
00:45:47.101 --> 00:45:49.336
need to remind myself
that it was an accident.


594
00:45:52.206 --> 00:45:53.040
Okay.

595
00:45:55.709 --> 00:45:57.378
Yeah, we hired the yacht.

596
00:45:58.913 --> 00:46:00.281
Whose idea was that?

597
00:46:02.082 --> 00:46:03.809
I think it was your dad's.

598
00:46:03.851 --> 00:46:06.086
Yeah, you
know what, so do I.


599
00:46:07.489 --> 00:46:08.322
Yeah.

600
00:46:10.559 --> 00:46:11.392
Go on.

601
00:46:13.727 --> 00:46:16.655
Then we sailed it out off
the coast to the shallow waters


602
00:46:16.697 --> 00:46:17.923
and dropped anchor.

603
00:46:17.965 --> 00:46:19.601
Okay. How far out?

604
00:46:21.202 --> 00:46:22.970
How far? A half a mile?

605
00:46:24.972 --> 00:46:29.569
Then we dropped the dinghy
and played around in it a bit


606
00:46:29.611 --> 00:46:30.669
and so on.

607
00:46:30.711 --> 00:46:31.812
So you got in it?

608
00:46:33.548 --> 00:46:36.476
Yeah, I was in the dinghy
with you at some point.


609
00:46:36.518 --> 00:46:37.351
Okay.

610
00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.021
When did we start drinking?

611
00:46:43.257 --> 00:46:44.384
Uh...

612
00:46:44.426 --> 00:46:45.493
Five, six.

613
00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:47.194
Yeah.

614
00:46:50.465 --> 00:46:52.434
And we were drinking what?

615
00:46:54.101 --> 00:46:54.935
Champagne?

616
00:46:56.136 --> 00:46:58.096
Oh, no, sparkling
wine. Local stuff.


617
00:46:58.138 --> 00:46:59.373
It was quite good.

618
00:47:00.341 --> 00:47:01.875
Yeah, Dad poured that, right?

619
00:47:04.912 --> 00:47:05.746
Yep.

620
00:47:07.414 --> 00:47:08.608
And then?

621
00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:12.044
Then we played a
few games, you know,


622
00:47:12.086 --> 00:47:13.588
card games and so on.

623
00:47:15.122 --> 00:47:15.956
Who won?

624
00:47:18.526 --> 00:47:20.018
We all won.

625
00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:22.997
Yeah, I mean, we weren't
exactly keeping track, so.


626
00:47:24.532 --> 00:47:26.133
And we were all drinking?

627
00:47:27.901 --> 00:47:29.395
Yeah.

628
00:47:29.437 --> 00:47:33.365
Okay, so after the, the
first glass of champagne,


629
00:47:33.407 --> 00:47:35.142
who gave me the next one?

630
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:39.748
I don't know, it was, it
was quite a long time ago.


631
00:47:46.053 --> 00:47:48.681
Lex, what's this about, huh?

632
00:47:48.723 --> 00:47:50.315
I'm struggling to
come to terms with it


633
00:47:50.357 --> 00:47:53.118
and just want the details.

634
00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.554
Yeah, but we've told
you all of this before.


635
00:47:54.596 --> 00:47:56.088
- Nothing's changed.
- I know.


636
00:47:56.130 --> 00:48:00.635
I just can't understand
some things like,


637
00:48:01.703 --> 00:48:02.961
how did we end up in the water?

638
00:48:03.003 --> 00:48:03.971
You tripped.

639
00:48:05.105 --> 00:48:06.940
Lexy, we've been over
this, you tripped.


640
00:48:07.808 --> 00:48:09.301
You were very drunk.

641
00:48:09.343 --> 00:48:11.003
Yeah, very drunk.

642
00:48:11.045 --> 00:48:12.505
More drunk than
I've ever seen you.


643
00:48:12.547 --> 00:48:17.552
We were all dancing around
having fun, and you tripped.


644
00:48:18.753 --> 00:48:20.613
You grabbed on to
your dad and Chloe


645
00:48:20.655 --> 00:48:22.582
and tried to use them
to save yourself,


646
00:48:22.624 --> 00:48:24.825
but just ended up
dragging them in with you.


647
00:48:26.927 --> 00:48:28.228
You were there, you saw?

648
00:48:30.598 --> 00:48:33.601
Yeah, well, I was
below deck with Vicky.


649
00:48:34.803 --> 00:48:37.129
You just said we
were all dancing.


650
00:48:37.171 --> 00:48:37.963
We were.

651
00:48:38.005 --> 00:48:39.373
Yeah, we were.

652
00:48:41.008 --> 00:48:42.134
I mean, you know
how parties are,


653
00:48:42.176 --> 00:48:43.802
people go off in
different directions,


654
00:48:43.844 --> 00:48:45.070
different rooms and...

655
00:48:45.112 --> 00:48:47.005
Music was really
loud on the deck.


656
00:48:47.047 --> 00:48:50.075
So we went below for a chat.

657
00:48:50.117 --> 00:48:51.511
What were you talking about?

658
00:48:51.553 --> 00:48:54.946
It was about the plans
for the next few days.


659
00:48:54.988 --> 00:48:56.315
Oh, yeah, we were
going to go off


660
00:48:56.357 --> 00:48:58.216
to Table Mountain and stuff.

661
00:48:58.258 --> 00:49:01.253
If you were below deck, how
did you know that I tripped?


662
00:49:01.295 --> 00:49:03.121
Well, you told the police.

663
00:49:03.163 --> 00:49:06.133
If I don't remember,
how did I tell them that?


664
00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:12.106
You suffered a very
traumatic experience,


665
00:49:13.575 --> 00:49:15.668
and in a lot of trauma cases,

666
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:19.204
you might remember straight
after, but then after that,


667
00:49:19.246 --> 00:49:20.247
you're gonna forget.

668
00:49:21.415 --> 00:49:23.141
Probably what happened,
you told the police


669
00:49:23.183 --> 00:49:24.452
and now you've forgotten.

670
00:49:25.386 --> 00:49:26.488
And you were drinking.

671
00:49:27.856 --> 00:49:29.890
Like drinking
affects the memory.


672
00:49:31.158 --> 00:49:34.052
I mean, you can blank
it out all you like


673
00:49:34.094 --> 00:49:36.355
and we can go over the details
again and again if you want,


674
00:49:36.397 --> 00:49:40.859
but it's not gonna
change what happened


675
00:49:40.901 --> 00:49:41.736
and it's just...

676
00:49:44.104 --> 00:49:48.409
It's not gonna change the
fact that it is your fault.


677
00:49:50.545 --> 00:49:53.414
Nothing we can say is
ever gonna change that.


678
00:49:55.149 --> 00:49:57.175
And that's just something
that you're gonna have


679
00:49:57.217 --> 00:50:00.278
to live with for the
rest of your life.


680
00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.155
It's...

681
00:50:26.648 --> 00:50:27.482
Hey.

682
00:50:30.518 --> 00:50:31.351
You okay?

683
00:50:32.986 --> 00:50:33.822
Do you care?

684
00:50:36.724 --> 00:50:38.384
Sorry, I was a
bit harsh earlier.


685
00:50:38.426 --> 00:50:41.161
You know, you gotta be cool
to be kind and all that.


686
00:50:44.298 --> 00:50:46.868
Hey, so you got drunk.

687
00:50:48.001 --> 00:50:49.762
Everyone gets
trashed occasionally


688
00:50:49.804 --> 00:50:53.675
especially at your age, and bad
shit happens when you drink.


689
00:50:55.042 --> 00:50:57.779
And yes, this was very bad shit.

690
00:50:59.279 --> 00:51:03.417
But, you've gotta come to
terms with the fact that,


691
00:51:06.153 --> 00:51:07.154
this was your fault,

692
00:51:08.422 --> 00:51:11.024
and nothing we can ever
say would change that.


693
00:51:15.996 --> 00:51:18.524
- Anyway, I...
- What's that?


694
00:51:18.566 --> 00:51:19.734
Is that a scar?

695
00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:23.605
Yeah.

696
00:51:24.806 --> 00:51:27.174
How'd you get it?
I don't remember it.


697
00:51:28.576 --> 00:51:30.368
Just a work thing,

698
00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:33.972
I think it was a
cheeseboard or something.


699
00:51:34.014 --> 00:51:35.675
Quite a
place to cut yourself.


700
00:51:35.717 --> 00:51:38.009
Yeah, I mean, I
was, I was drunk.


701
00:51:38.051 --> 00:51:40.212
I don't exactly remember it, so.

702
00:51:40.254 --> 00:51:41.956
Drinking does
affect the memory.


703
00:51:46.895 --> 00:51:51.866
Anyway,
gotta head to work.


704
00:51:53.468 --> 00:51:55.461
It's this fucking
deal with Japan,


705
00:51:55.503 --> 00:51:56.738
I know, it's so annoying.

706
00:51:58.205 --> 00:52:01.099
Just gotta go to the office
and finalize a few things.


707
00:52:01.141 --> 00:52:05.438
So I might be there
until the early hours


708
00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:08.282
or I might just stay there.

709
00:52:10.752 --> 00:52:13.946
Anyway, look at these.

710
00:52:13.988 --> 00:52:17.725
I thought maybe
they'll help you sleep.


711
00:52:18.726 --> 00:52:20.127
You been having trouble, so.

712
00:52:26.734 --> 00:52:27.569
Take 'em.

713
00:54:09.236 --> 00:54:10.138
Lex. Lex.

714
00:54:11.105 --> 00:54:11.939
Wait.

715
00:54:13.941 --> 00:54:14.776
Lex, wait!

716
00:54:16.209 --> 00:54:17.403
Lex.

717
00:54:17.445 --> 00:54:20.106
Look, things haven't
been the same since...


718
00:54:20.148 --> 00:54:22.984
You haven't been the same
and this just kinda happened.


719
00:54:24.251 --> 00:54:25.887
It just happened?

720
00:54:27.088 --> 00:54:29.322
You won't fucking
touch me, is she why?


721
00:54:30.692 --> 00:54:33.452
What other lies have
you been feeding me?


722
00:54:33.494 --> 00:54:35.655
Lex, please, just calm down.

723
00:54:35.697 --> 00:54:37.556
- Put the knife down.
- I hate you.


724
00:54:37.598 --> 00:54:39.392
Put the knife down.

725
00:54:39.434 --> 00:54:40.501
I hate you.

726
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:44.505
Okay, just...

727
00:54:46.339 --> 00:54:47.274
Fuck you.

728
00:54:48.576 --> 00:54:50.144
I fucking hate you.

729
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.339
Put the knife down.

730
00:54:54.381 --> 00:54:55.741
Don't...

731
00:54:55.783 --> 00:54:57.143
Get out!

732
00:54:57.185 --> 00:54:58.110
Lex.

733
00:54:58.152 --> 00:54:59.712
- Get out!
- Okay.


734
00:54:59.754 --> 00:55:01.022
I'm going, okay?

735
00:55:55.243 --> 00:55:56.077
Morning.

736
00:55:58.079 --> 00:55:59.872
What are you still doing here?

737
00:55:59.914 --> 00:56:00.681
I live here.

738
00:56:01.883 --> 00:56:03.909
Not anymore, get the
fuck out of my house.


739
00:56:03.951 --> 00:56:05.285
But it's my house, Lexy.

740
00:56:10.357 --> 00:56:13.351
Realistically, I could
ask you to move out.


741
00:56:13.393 --> 00:56:15.387
I mean, you've been living
here for these past few months


742
00:56:15.429 --> 00:56:16.764
without paying any rent.

743
00:56:18.599 --> 00:56:21.794
But no, I've been good to you.

744
00:56:21.836 --> 00:56:23.471
Extremely patient.

745
00:56:24.839 --> 00:56:26.732
Paid your way while
you've been out for work,


746
00:56:26.774 --> 00:56:29.034
cooked for you, cleaned for you,

747
00:56:29.076 --> 00:56:30.569
put up with your moods.

748
00:56:30.611 --> 00:56:32.238
Acted like a mother to you.

749
00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:34.006
You're sick.

750
00:56:34.048 --> 00:56:35.975
My mother could
never do that to me.


751
00:56:36.017 --> 00:56:37.910
Oh, sweetie.

752
00:56:37.952 --> 00:56:39.654
That relationship
died months ago.


753
00:56:41.088 --> 00:56:42.681
You didn't really think
he was gonna stay with you


754
00:56:42.723 --> 00:56:45.251
while you were in
this state, did you?


755
00:56:45.293 --> 00:56:46.627
It was inevitable.

756
00:56:48.062 --> 00:56:49.221
We were just waiting for the
right moment to tell you.


757
00:56:49.263 --> 00:56:52.224
You didn't just tell
me, you showed me.


758
00:56:52.266 --> 00:56:54.426
Well, we thought
you'd be asleep.


759
00:56:54.468 --> 00:56:56.369
Asleep? That's your excuse?

760
00:57:10.284 --> 00:57:11.644
Hi, this is Amy Watkins.

761
00:57:11.686 --> 00:57:12.878
Please leave a message,

762
00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:14.989
and I'll get back to
you as soon as I can.


763
00:57:40.848 --> 00:57:42.074
Lex!

764
00:57:42.116 --> 00:57:43.776
Sorry, have you
got a few minutes?


765
00:57:43.818 --> 00:57:45.010
I really need to talk to you.

766
00:57:45.052 --> 00:57:47.413
I'm sorry, I'm with
a client, and I'm...


767
00:57:47.455 --> 00:57:49.290
Please, just five minutes.

768
00:57:51.092 --> 00:57:52.384
No, no, it's fine.

769
00:57:52.426 --> 00:57:53.351
I'll wait outside.

770
00:57:53.393 --> 00:57:54.520
Really?

771
00:57:54.562 --> 00:57:55.454
It's fine.

772
00:57:55.496 --> 00:57:57.823
I'm so sorry, thank you.

773
00:57:57.865 --> 00:57:58.757
Lex, this is most...

774
00:57:58.799 --> 00:58:00.034
She did it.

775
00:58:02.003 --> 00:58:03.462
They fucking did it.

776
00:58:03.504 --> 00:58:06.040
Vicky and Isaac, I'm sure they
had something to do with it.


777
00:58:07.608 --> 00:58:10.202
What? The attack?

778
00:58:10.244 --> 00:58:11.470
I've been piecing
it all together


779
00:58:11.512 --> 00:58:13.606
and the more I think
about it, the more,


780
00:58:13.648 --> 00:58:14.749
it just fits.

781
00:58:16.851 --> 00:58:19.287
I caught, I caught them.

782
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:24.016
I caught them.

783
00:58:24.058 --> 00:58:24.892
Oh my God.

784
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:30.264
Okay.

785
00:58:31.232 --> 00:58:33.325
Before you make any assumptions

786
00:58:33.367 --> 00:58:38.372
or go around accusing anybody,
let's go over the facts.


787
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:43.544
Right.

788
00:58:44.979 --> 00:58:49.475
The police, they ruled out
anything suspicious, didn't they?


789
00:58:49.517 --> 00:58:50.451
Yeah.

790
00:58:51.619 --> 00:58:53.454
Then you need to
be absolutely sure.


791
00:58:56.157 --> 00:58:57.458
Let's go through it again.

792
00:59:04.231 --> 00:59:06.968
So, Ms. McKenna, I,

793
00:59:08.135 --> 00:59:09.503
I hate to ask this,

794
00:59:10.738 --> 00:59:12.131
but is there any
reason you can think of


795
00:59:12.173 --> 00:59:14.809
as to why this might not
have been an accident?


796
00:59:16.477 --> 00:59:17.812
Not an accident?

797
00:59:18.679 --> 00:59:21.173
Yes, any reason you believe

798
00:59:21.215 --> 00:59:24.343
that maybe somebody in your
party wanted to see you,


799
00:59:24.385 --> 00:59:27.221
your father and your
sister end up in the water?


800
00:59:29.223 --> 00:59:30.417
No, no way.

801
00:59:30.459 --> 00:59:34.495
Okay, so as far as
your opinion goes,


802
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:36.555
the events were usual.

803
00:59:36.597 --> 00:59:38.357
There was nothing suspicious.

804
00:59:38.399 --> 00:59:39.934
No, I don't think so.

805
00:59:42.903 --> 00:59:47.099
Is there a chance that your
drinks might have been spiked?


806
00:59:47.141 --> 00:59:48.042
Why?

807
00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:50.202
You tell us.

808
00:59:50.244 --> 00:59:51.804
We don't know the
people involved.


809
00:59:51.846 --> 00:59:54.048
You'd have a much better
idea than we would.


810
00:59:58.719 --> 01:00:00.821
Vicky for example.

811
01:00:02.289 --> 01:00:05.317
You said she's your
father's second wife.


812
01:00:05.359 --> 01:00:06.193
Yeah.

813
01:00:07.728 --> 01:00:09.597
What are your
feelings towards her?


814
01:00:10.564 --> 01:00:13.067
Any hostility between you?

815
01:00:16.904 --> 01:00:18.364
I mean, it's weird.

816
01:00:18.406 --> 01:00:21.500
I mean, I mean, my, my mom died

817
01:00:21.542 --> 01:00:23.778
and she had been
there my whole life.


818
01:00:25.046 --> 01:00:25.880
I mean, I,

819
01:00:28.015 --> 01:00:32.277
I guess I thought it was a
little soon for Dad to remarry,


820
01:00:32.319 --> 01:00:35.948
but he was happy.

821
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:38.959
It wasn't my place
to question that.


822
01:02:28.503 --> 01:02:29.728
Going somewhere?

823
01:02:29.770 --> 01:02:31.630
Get out of my way.

824
01:02:31.672 --> 01:02:32.740
How was counseling?

825
01:02:44.285 --> 01:02:47.622
Now be a good girl,
and take your pills.


826
01:02:48.657 --> 01:02:49.658
No!

827
01:02:59.601 --> 01:03:00.901
There you go. Swallow.

828
01:03:01.902 --> 01:03:04.104
Come on, get em down, yeah?

829
01:03:05.072 --> 01:03:05.906
Swallow.

830
01:03:11.412 --> 01:03:12.246
Good girl.

831
01:03:13.814 --> 01:03:14.649
Now sleep.

832
01:07:47.087 --> 01:07:48.756
Come on, the keys.

833
01:07:50.123 --> 01:07:50.959
Oh, fuck.

834
01:08:24.459 --> 01:08:26.126
Looking for these?

835
01:08:30.397 --> 01:08:31.733
Give me those.

836
01:09:06.734 --> 01:09:07.569
Feel familiar?

837
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:13.173
What's going through
your mind, Lexy?


838
01:09:14.676 --> 01:09:16.176
You feeling lucky?

839
01:09:17.344 --> 01:09:19.972
Probably not a good idea
to go into the water.


840
01:09:20.014 --> 01:09:21.950
You know, it could
be anything in there.


841
01:09:25.954 --> 01:09:29.849
Crocodiles, maybe a piranha.

842
01:09:29.891 --> 01:09:32.594
It's amazing what you can go
off the dark web these days.


843
01:09:36.497 --> 01:09:37.757
Oh, and in case you forgot

844
01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:40.593
what with all the
wine and drugs,


845
01:09:40.635 --> 01:09:42.336
it's your sister's
birthday today.


846
01:09:47.107 --> 01:09:50.812
She would have been

847
01:09:54.147 --> 01:09:56.017
Weird things,
birthdays, aren't they?


848
01:09:57.485 --> 01:10:00.746
People celebrate as if you've
made some massive achievement


849
01:10:00.788 --> 01:10:01.948
when all you've really done

850
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:03.491
is just gone another
year surviving.


851
01:10:06.427 --> 01:10:08.395
I mean hardly an
achievement, isn't it?


852
01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:10.965
Maybe it is.

853
01:10:15.268 --> 01:10:20.273
Anyway, I thought I'd
pay a little tribute


854
01:10:23.243 --> 01:10:24.479
to your sister.

855
01:10:26.748 --> 01:10:29.383
So I put together some scenes
from her last birthday.


856
01:10:30.952 --> 01:10:31.853
No images.

857
01:10:33.387 --> 01:10:34.221
Just sound.

858
01:10:36.858 --> 01:10:39.259
I'm sure you won't struggle
to put the pictures in.


859
01:10:41.261 --> 01:10:43.431
That's the great thing
about memories, isn't it?


860
01:10:44.666 --> 01:10:48.536
You can replay them over
and over and over again.


861
01:11:01.449 --> 01:11:02.282
Good luck.

862
01:11:30.545 --> 01:11:31.612
Oh, please.

863
01:11:34.148 --> 01:11:34.982
Please.

864
01:11:58.005 --> 01:11:58.806
Chloe!

865
01:12:00.208 --> 01:12:01.008
It's okay.

866
01:12:02.143 --> 01:12:04.235
It's okay, it's just a pool.

867
01:12:04.277 --> 01:12:05.446
You love swimming

868
01:12:10.383 --> 01:12:12.611
There's nothing in there.

869
01:12:12.653 --> 01:12:15.523
There's nothing in there that
can hurt you, he's lying.


870
01:12:22.864 --> 01:12:24.198
It's just water.

871
01:13:59.827 --> 01:14:01.887
Okay, go.

872
01:14:01.929 --> 01:14:04.490
Yeah, Dad, your turn, go.

873
01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:07.602
Oh God, stop.

874
01:14:08.536 --> 01:14:09.528
You want me to stop?

875
01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:11.873
Yeah, stop it. That's awful.

876
01:14:13.007 --> 01:14:15.076
Smile, happy Christmas.

877
01:14:23.885 --> 01:14:25.052
Okay, hang on.

878
01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:50.669
One, two, three.

879
01:14:50.711 --> 01:14:53.481
Merry Christmas.

880
01:15:21.075 --> 01:15:22.176
Fuck. Okay.

881
01:15:33.254 --> 01:15:34.088
Oh, fuck.

882
01:15:34.922 --> 01:15:35.756
Come on!

883
01:16:10.391 --> 01:16:12.393
You won't get in here.

884
01:16:13.327 --> 01:16:14.595
Then come out!

885
01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:20.067
Come out and tell me what
the fuck is going on.


886
01:16:21.502 --> 01:16:23.595
Come on, or I'll...

887
01:16:23.637 --> 01:16:26.307
You'll what? Break up with me?

888
01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:30.911
You sure as hell won't
get out the house.


889
01:16:36.083 --> 01:16:37.885
We've got a pretty
good setup in it.


890
01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:42.223
Plenty of food, and en suite.

891
01:16:43.557 --> 01:16:45.760
And of course your
stepmom for entertainment.


892
01:16:52.833 --> 01:16:54.001
So you'll never escape.

893
01:16:57.004 --> 01:16:59.607
There are two ways
out of this for you.


894
01:17:01.208 --> 01:17:04.045
You can either slowly
starve and freeze to death.


895
01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:09.083
Go to your memories
to keep you company.


896
01:17:11.786 --> 01:17:13.287
You can take the easy way out.

897
01:17:14.889 --> 01:17:15.723
You have a knife,

898
01:17:17.526 --> 01:17:19.794
there's an assortment
of pills in the kitchen


899
01:17:21.295 --> 01:17:23.889
and we left you a
nice bottle of wine,


900
01:17:23.931 --> 01:17:25.766
as a farewell present.

901
01:17:29.538 --> 01:17:31.205
The choice is yours.

902
01:21:01.248 --> 01:21:02.751
Has she done it?

903
01:21:05.386 --> 01:21:06.854
We'll find out soon enough.

904
01:21:34.549 --> 01:21:35.974
What's the matter?

905
01:21:36.016 --> 01:21:37.851
Not what you expected?

906
01:21:39.353 --> 01:21:41.046
Surely after all
the fun you've had,


907
01:21:41.088 --> 01:21:44.958
you should know the reality
isn't what our eyes always see.


908
01:21:47.094 --> 01:21:47.861
Don't!

909
01:21:50.331 --> 01:21:51.198
How does it feel?

910
01:21:52.634 --> 01:21:56.028
To lose control of your
plan at the last moment?


911
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:57.706
God, that must be frustrating.

912
01:21:58.872 --> 01:22:00.433
Plans, I don't know...

913
01:22:00.475 --> 01:22:01.933
Please.

914
01:22:01.975 --> 01:22:05.538
All I've heard from you is
lie after lie after lie.


915
01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:07.682
This time, you're gonna
tell me the truth.


916
01:22:08.616 --> 01:22:09.808
If you want me to call for help,

917
01:22:09.850 --> 01:22:11.310
so you don't bleed
out on my floor,


918
01:22:11.352 --> 01:22:14.012
you're gonna tell me what
exactly happened that night.


919
01:22:14.054 --> 01:22:15.322
I wanna know all of it.

920
01:22:19.794 --> 01:22:23.121
We hired a yacht, took you
out into the shallow ends


921
01:22:23.163 --> 01:22:25.800
off the coast, got out
into the dinghy, snorkeled,


922
01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:28.603
enjoyed the sun.

923
01:22:35.643 --> 01:22:38.438
And then on board.

924
01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:39.947
I remember that.

925
01:22:41.115 --> 01:22:41.949
Go on.

926
01:22:43.417 --> 01:22:47.756
And then we spiked your
drinks, the three of you.


927
01:22:49.591 --> 01:22:53.318
And waited until you
eventually passed out.


928
01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:57.724
I did, I did trip over but
it was over Chloe, wasn't it?


929
01:22:57.766 --> 01:23:02.670
Yeah.

930
01:24:21.348 --> 01:24:22.282
And then?

931
01:24:24.819 --> 01:24:29.824
We went out
deeper into the ocean,


932
01:24:33.227 --> 01:24:37.432
to some area known for being
infested with great whites.


933
01:24:38.933 --> 01:24:40.267
We threw you out to sea,

934
01:24:42.604 --> 01:24:47.609
and left
you for the sharks.


935
01:24:48.810 --> 01:24:49.711
That's how you cut
your hand, isn't it?


936
01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:55.040
You got the scar 'cause you
were trying to attract them.


937
01:24:55.082 --> 01:24:57.910
Yeah, and we slashed the
dinghy and threw it out


938
01:24:57.952 --> 01:24:59.754
to make it look
like an accident.


939
01:25:01.154 --> 01:25:03.190
Like you'd
drunk and gone out in it.


940
01:25:04.826 --> 01:25:06.059
Well, that backfired.

941
01:25:06.928 --> 01:25:08.596
It ended up saving my life.

942
01:25:09.931 --> 01:25:11.990
And you know, for
most of the last year,


943
01:25:12.032 --> 01:25:13.258
I'd been wishing it hadn't.

944
01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:17.005
But, my God, am I
happy to be alive.


945
01:25:18.338 --> 01:25:21.434
I'm gonna spend my
life watching you two


946
01:25:21.476 --> 01:25:24.169
spend the rest of yours
rotting in prison.


947
01:25:24.211 --> 01:25:25.847
- Don't you dare!
- Wait.


948
01:25:27.015 --> 01:25:28.850
Wait, I had nothing
to do with this.


949
01:25:30.852 --> 01:25:32.912
Lexy, I understand you're angry.

950
01:25:32.954 --> 01:25:34.981
I know how this might look.

951
01:25:35.023 --> 01:25:37.391
It looks like you're
an accomplice to murder.


952
01:25:38.793 --> 01:25:41.029
I have nothing
to do with this.


953
01:25:41.896 --> 01:25:43.130
This was all on you.

954
01:25:45.033 --> 01:25:47.602
You fucking
roped me into this.


955
01:25:48.503 --> 01:25:49.695
You're a liar.

956
01:25:49.737 --> 01:25:50.738
Let him finish.

957
01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:54.074
This happened way
before I met you, Lex.


958
01:25:56.044 --> 01:25:56.878
I wasn't...

959
01:25:59.179 --> 01:26:00.014
I, got on,

960
01:26:02.650 --> 01:26:06.554
mowing lawns, and cutting
trees, nothing glamorous


961
01:26:10.458 --> 01:26:14.394
One of the guys whose lawn
I mowed was an old guy.


962
01:26:18.398 --> 01:26:19.467
Mr. Randall.

963
01:26:21.335 --> 01:26:23.729
One day, he was
feeling really poorly.


964
01:26:23.771 --> 01:26:25.731
So he asked me to
go to the pharmacy


965
01:26:25.773 --> 01:26:27.240
and pick up his prescription.

966
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:30.344
So I did.

967
01:26:33.982 --> 01:26:36.383
Vicky worked behind the
counter at the pharmacy.


968
01:26:38.385 --> 01:26:42.180
She asked so many questions,
and she was so flirty.


969
01:26:42.222 --> 01:26:46.094
Said she hoped to see me
again soon.


970
01:26:50.865 --> 01:26:54.159
Next thing I knew, she turns
up at Mr. Randall's house,


971
01:26:54.201 --> 01:26:56.104
tells me to get in
the car for a chat.


972
01:27:01.075 --> 01:27:02.477
That's where it all started.

973
01:27:04.277 --> 01:27:07.081
A few weeks later,
Mr. Randall was dead.


974
01:27:11.119 --> 01:27:12.445
He left me some
money in his well.


975
01:27:12.487 --> 01:27:13.879
Fantastic story.

976
01:27:13.921 --> 01:27:15.313
What a wonderful
imagination you have.


977
01:27:15.355 --> 01:27:17.025
Oh, you're fucked.

978
01:27:18.793 --> 01:27:20.953
Befriending old
vulnerable people


979
01:27:20.995 --> 01:27:23.431
so you can fuck with
their medication.


980
01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:28.402
Well, they were
gonna die soon anyway.


981
01:27:37.679 --> 01:27:40.748
So it was you who
laced the drinks.


982
01:27:42.884 --> 01:27:43.951
I am sorry.

983
01:27:45.153 --> 01:27:46.846
It was never meant to go
this far, it was never...


984
01:27:46.888 --> 01:27:49.949
It's a little
bit late for that.


985
01:28:15.650 --> 01:28:16.984
You're finished.

986
01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:40.875
- Get out of my room.
- Shut up!


987
01:28:42.009 --> 01:28:44.870
Lexy, you don't
believe him, do you?


988
01:28:44.912 --> 01:28:46.204
It was all his idea.

989
01:28:46.246 --> 01:28:47.807
Oh, don't lie to me!

990
01:28:47.849 --> 01:28:50.176
I'm not lying to you, Lexy.

991
01:28:50.218 --> 01:28:52.712
I never felt
comfortable with you.


992
01:28:52.754 --> 01:28:54.613
You knew dad had life insurance.

993
01:28:54.655 --> 01:28:56.082
With the three of
us out of the way,


994
01:28:56.124 --> 01:28:58.484
you'd have the money and
your house all to yourself.


995
01:28:58.526 --> 01:29:00.586
No, it wasn't about the money.

996
01:29:00.628 --> 01:29:01.554
And what?

997
01:29:01.596 --> 01:29:03.723
Then Isaac came along and,

998
01:29:03.765 --> 01:29:06.357
maybe that wasn't a
coincidence either.


999
01:29:06.399 --> 01:29:09.470
And you planned a little
family holiday together.


1000
01:29:10.905 --> 01:29:14.100
You were so insistent on South
Africa, more sharks, right?


1001
01:29:14.142 --> 01:29:16.068
I mean, it makes sense.

1002
01:29:16.110 --> 01:29:18.104
It's not true, it's not true.

1003
01:29:18.146 --> 01:29:22.349
You know what I don't get,
you wanna kill me, right?


1004
01:29:23.484 --> 01:29:25.978
I've been in this house
with you for a year.


1005
01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:27.146
What took you so long?

1006
01:29:27.188 --> 01:29:30.124
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1007
01:29:31.259 --> 01:29:34.386
Let's make this
nice and easy, okay?


1008
01:29:34.428 --> 01:29:35.295
What do you want?

1009
01:29:36.998 --> 01:29:39.332
What can I do to make
all this go away?


1010
01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:50.278
I want my dad
and my sister back.


1011
01:29:54.215 --> 01:29:55.449
Lexy, please.

1012
01:30:08.462 --> 01:30:11.566
Okay, there's
something you can do.


1013
01:30:13.868 --> 01:30:16.537
Sign over the deed to the house.

1014
01:30:28.683 --> 01:30:32.044
I had my last session
today with Fran.


1015
01:30:32.086 --> 01:30:33.579
Oh my gosh, that's amazing.

1016
01:30:33.621 --> 01:30:36.682
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.


1017
01:30:36.724 --> 01:30:41.187
So the house, have you decided
what you're doing with it?


1018
01:30:41.229 --> 01:30:44.423
No, I don't think
I can let go of it.


1019
01:30:44.465 --> 01:30:45.691
You're not gonna sell it?

1020
01:30:45.733 --> 01:30:46.659
No.

1021
01:30:46.701 --> 01:30:48.594
What, Lex, you'd make a mint.

1022
01:30:48.636 --> 01:30:53.608
I know, but it was
dad's and grandpa's


1023
01:30:54.809 --> 01:30:56.444
and it meant so
much to them, so.


1024
01:30:58.479 --> 01:31:01.749
So have you heard from
Isaac or Vicky recently?


1025
01:31:04.185 --> 01:31:05.019
Nope.

1026
01:31:07.288 --> 01:31:10.791
And I don't think I will
for a very long time.


1027
01:31:14.095 --> 01:31:16.388
But hey, brighter days ahead.

1028
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:17.890
Should we do a cheers?

1029
01:31:17.932 --> 01:31:18.766
Okay.

1030
01:31:20.201 --> 01:31:23.896
To a fresh start.

1031
01:31:23.938 --> 01:31:25.898
To a fresh start.

1032
01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:27.466
And more wine.

1033
01:31:27.508 --> 01:31:28.342
Always.

1034
01:31:40.936 --> 01:31:45.936
