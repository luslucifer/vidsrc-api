1
00:01:11.876 --> 00:01:13.673
<i>He was growing into middle age...</i>

2
00:01:13.845 --> 00:01:17.372
<i>...and was living then in a bungalow
on Woodland Avenue.</i>


3
00:01:19.283 --> 00:01:21.478
<i>He installed himself in a rocking chair...</i>

4
00:01:21.652 --> 00:01:23.711
<i>...and smoked a cigar down
in the evenings...</i>


5
00:01:23.887 --> 00:01:26.788
<i>...as his wife wiped her pink hands
on an apron...</i>


6
00:01:26.957 --> 00:01:30.154
<i>...and reported happily
on their two children.</i>


7
00:01:36.098 --> 00:01:37.656
<i>His children knew his legs...</i>

8
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:41.163
<i>...the sting of his mustache
against their cheeks.</i>


9
00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:47.167
<i>They didn't know how their father made
his living or why they so often moved.</i>


10
00:01:47.942 --> 00:01:50.809
<i>They didn't even know
their father's name.</i>


11
00:01:53.147 --> 00:01:56.980
<i>He was listed in the city directory
as Thomas Howard.</i>


12
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.582
<i>And he went everywhere unrecognized...</i>

13
00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:02.813
<i>...and lunched with Kansas City
shopkeepers and merchants...</i>


14
00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:06.347
<i>...calling himself a cattleman
or a commodities investor...</i>


15
00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.819
<i>...someone rich and leisured
who had the common touch.</i>


16
00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:17.367
<i>He had two incompletely healed
bullet holes in his chest...</i>


17
00:02:17.535 --> 00:02:19.093
<i>...and another in his thigh.</i>

18
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.795
<i>He was missing the nub
of his left middle finger...</i>


19
00:02:21.973 --> 00:02:25.203
<i>...and was cautious,
lest that mutilation be seen.</i>


20
00:02:26.977 --> 00:02:30.708
<i>He also had a condition that was
referred to as ''granulated eyelids ''...</i>


21
00:02:30.881 --> 00:02:33.873
<i>...and it caused him
to blink more than usual...</i>


22
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.779
<i>...as if he found creation
slightly more than he could accept.</i>


23
00:02:40.388 --> 00:02:42.982
<i>Rooms seemed hotter
when he was in them.</i>


24
00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:45.187
<i>Rains fell straighter.</i>

25
00:02:45.794 --> 00:02:47.125
<i>Clocks slowed.</i>

26
00:02:47.796 --> 00:02:50.059
<i>Sounds were amplified.</i>

27
00:02:51.165 --> 00:02:53.963
<i>He considered himself
a Southern loyalist and guerrilla...</i>


28
00:02:54.134 --> 00:02:57.103
<i>...in a Civil War that never ended.</i>

29
00:02:57.271 --> 00:03:02.640
<i>He regretted neither his robberies,
nor the 1 7 murders that he laid claim to.</i>


30
00:03:09.214 --> 00:03:13.378
<i>He had seen another summer under
in Kansas City, Missouri...</i>


31
00:03:13.551 --> 00:03:17.851
<i>...and on September 5th
in the year 1 881...</i>


32
00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.651
<i>...he was 34 years old.</i>

33
00:03:28.498 --> 00:03:32.366
You just-- You just slide them things
right in there, right in your sleeve...


34
00:03:32.535 --> 00:03:35.561
...and then, when you get ready,
you just shake it out.


35
00:03:35.738 --> 00:03:38.070
Like that, right there. 
You shake it out.

36
00:03:41.943 --> 00:03:45.606
Mary Todd Lincoln, tyrant's wife, fall
into hysterics when the moon was full.


37
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.340
President's men would tie her up
with hay-baling wire...


38
00:03:48.516 --> 00:03:50.711
...keep her from ripping
her husband's ears off.


39
00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:55.378
You never heard word one about the wife of
the Confederacy's Jefferson Davis, did you?


40
00:03:55.555 --> 00:03:56.852
-l didn't.
-No, you didn't.


41
00:03:57.624 --> 00:03:59.956
He did his duty by her.

42
00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:04.852
-Oh, my God, l'm speaking to children.
-No, l get it, l get it, l get it.


43
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.228
The president of the Confederacy discerned
his wife's needs and satisfied them...


44
00:04:09.535 --> 00:04:14.029
...with the utmost skill
and the utmost courtesy.


45
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.297
-Charley, you spit all over my boot.
-Sorry. Sorry, sorry, Jesse.


46
00:04:19.943 --> 00:04:22.434
-Here, get it off.
-l'll wipe it-- l'll wipe it off.


47
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.975
But Abraham Lincoln probably sent his wife
on a shopping expedition.


48
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.915
-A three-act play.
-With money stole from us.


49
00:04:31.988 --> 00:04:33.922
Chow!

50
00:04:36.726 --> 00:04:39.752
l think insanity run on both sides
of that Lincoln family.


51
00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:41.829
You're right about that.

52
00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:44.591
The river-
- You jump in the river.

53
00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:50.127
-Chow!
-Don't be shy now, Dick.


54
00:04:50.404 --> 00:04:52.736
-One more piece of meat.
-When you diddle a lot....


55
00:04:52.907 --> 00:04:55.398
There's a good piece of bacon fat
in there for him.


56
00:05:30.774 --> 00:05:32.366
Excuse me.

57
00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.503
l see l've traipsed right on in
and interrupted you.


58
00:05:38.847 --> 00:05:40.542
Who are you, then?

59
00:05:41.183 --> 00:05:43.048
Bob Ford.

60
00:05:44.453 --> 00:05:45.681
Charley's brother?

61
00:05:47.154 --> 00:05:48.553
Yeah.

62
00:06:02.702 --> 00:06:05.899
l was lying when l said
l just happened down here.


63
00:06:06.072 --> 00:06:10.338
l've been looking for you. l feel lousy
l didn't say so at the outset.


64
00:06:12.911 --> 00:06:14.503
Folks take me for a nincompoop...

65
00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:18.410
...on account of the shabby first impression
l make, whereas l think of myself...


66
00:06:18.583 --> 00:06:21.017
...as being just a rung down
from the James brothers.


67
00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.854
l was hoping if l ran into you
aside from those peckerwoods...


68
00:06:25.022 --> 00:06:29.082
...l could show you how special l am.

69
00:06:40.535 --> 00:06:44.528
l honestly believe l'm destined
for great things, Mr. James.


70
00:06:44.706 --> 00:06:49.040
l got qualities that don't come shining
through right at the outset.


71
00:06:51.712 --> 00:06:54.875
You give me a chance, l'll get
the job done. l guarantee you that.


72
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.384
Hey, Dick, is it
true you diddled a squaw?

73
00:07:04.623 --> 00:07:08.855
Come on, you can tell me. l've always
wanted to lay down with a redskin.


74
00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:10.861
Well, Charley...

75
00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:15.767
...there's a feeling that comes over you...

76
00:07:15.934 --> 00:07:19.596
...getting inside a woman whose hands
has scalped a congregation.


77
00:07:19.771 --> 00:07:22.604
There's this thunderous sound
that comes from their cooch...


78
00:07:22.774 --> 00:07:26.039
...on account of the fact that
they birth a child standing upright...


79
00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:29.201
-...like a wild animal.
-What's it sound like?


80
00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:33.644
Whatever a thunderous cooch sounds like
there, Charley. l don't know.


81
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.649
No.

82
00:07:35.818 --> 00:07:38.218
They got a noisy quim
on account of the fact that...


83
00:07:38.387 --> 00:07:43.289
...they use their cunnis as a saddlebag
to carry sundries across the plains.


84
00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:47.355
Come on, what'd it really feel like?
Did it feel good?


85
00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:49.929
Come on, fess up, now.

86
00:07:50.098 --> 00:07:51.998
l like you, Charley.

87
00:07:53.401 --> 00:07:55.595
l like you too, Charley.

88
00:07:56.036 --> 00:07:57.060
Well....

89
00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:01.096
You're not so special, Mr. Ford.

90
00:08:02.108 --> 00:08:05.976
You're just like any other tyro
who's prinked himself up for an escapade.


91
00:08:06.145 --> 00:08:09.978
Hoping to be a gunslinger
like them nickel books are about.


92
00:08:10.982 --> 00:08:13.849
You may as well
quench your mind of it...

93
00:08:15.087 --> 00:08:18.113
...because you don't have
the ingredients, son.


94
00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:35.667
Well, l'm sorry to hear
you feel that way...


95
00:08:35.838 --> 00:08:39.035
...as l put such stock
in your opinions.


96
00:08:44.213 --> 00:08:48.308
As for me being a gunslinger, l've just got
this one granddaddy Paterson Colt...


97
00:08:48.483 --> 00:08:50.951
...and a borrowed belt to stick it in.

98
00:08:51.119 --> 00:08:54.452
But l also got an appetite
for greater things.


99
00:08:57.692 --> 00:09:01.718
l hoped by joining up with you, it'd put me
that much closer to getting them.


100
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:07.292
Well, what am l
supposed to say to that?

101
00:09:09.668 --> 00:09:11.363
Let me be your sidekick tonight.

102
00:09:11.537 --> 00:09:12.662
Sidekick?

103
00:09:12.837 --> 00:09:14.964
So you can examine my grit
and intelligence.


104
00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.835
l don't know what it is about you...

105
00:09:17.008 --> 00:09:20.068
...but the more you talk,
the more you give me the willies.


106
00:09:20.512 --> 00:09:24.141
Now, l don't believe l want you anywhere
within earshot this evening, okay?


107
00:09:24.315 --> 00:09:25.804
You understand?

108
00:09:29.987 --> 00:09:33.354
-Well, l'm sorry--
-Why don't you just get now? Scat.


109
00:09:39.528 --> 00:09:40.620
All right.

110
00:09:43.365 --> 00:09:46.926
l was with a
girl once, wasn't a squaw.

111
00:09:47.102 --> 00:09:48.967
But she was pretty.

112
00:09:49.337 --> 00:09:53.705
She had yellow hair like a....

113
00:09:55.409 --> 00:09:57.274
Oh, like something.

114
00:09:57.545 --> 00:10:00.412
Like hair bobbed from a ray of sunlight?

115
00:10:00.581 --> 00:10:03.515
Yeah. Yeah, like that.

116
00:10:04.184 --> 00:10:06.880
Boy, you-
- You talk good.

117
00:10:07.052 --> 00:10:09.714
You can hide things in vocabulary.

118
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:16.251
Maybe you and me could write her a note,
send it by post?


119
00:10:16.427 --> 00:10:18.122
See, all you gotta do, Ed...

120
00:10:18.296 --> 00:10:21.595
...is predict her needs
and beat her to the punch.


121
00:10:23.267 --> 00:10:27.533
Well, this girl, she
has a real specific job.

122
00:10:28.139 --> 00:10:30.629
-Specific?
-We was only together once.


123
00:10:30.807 --> 00:10:32.069
She--

124
00:10:32.742 --> 00:10:37.304
She was afraid of lightning,
and she came up under the wagon and...


125
00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.415
...just cuddled right up to me.

126
00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:42.550
She give me a kind price too.

127
00:10:44.586 --> 00:10:48.613
Well, l'll be. 
That is specific.

128
00:10:51.326 --> 00:10:53.624
Yeah, sure,
she'd been with other people...


129
00:10:53.795 --> 00:10:55.853
...but the kind of
things she said to me...

130
00:10:56.029 --> 00:10:59.157
...people just don't say
unless they really mean it.


131
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.398
<i>My love said she would marry only me</i>

132
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:06.296
<i>And Jove himself could not make her care.</i>

133
00:11:06.473 --> 00:11:09.066
<i>For what women say to lovers, you'll agree</i>

134
00:11:09.242 --> 00:11:13.338
<i>One writes on running water or on air.</i>

135
00:11:14.813 --> 00:11:18.408
My God, that's good.
Let's write her that.


136
00:11:19.417 --> 00:11:21.043
No.

137
00:11:21.352 --> 00:11:23.752
Poetry don't work on whores.

138
00:11:27.358 --> 00:11:28.916
How do you do?

139
00:11:31.328 --> 00:11:33.420
Am l too late
to wish you a happy birthday?


140
00:11:35.999 --> 00:11:37.261
How'd you know?

141
00:11:37.834 --> 00:11:40.098
You'd be surprised
at what l got stored away.


142
00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.864
l'm an authority on the James boys.

143
00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:44.506
ls you?

144
00:11:46.207 --> 00:11:50.735
Well-- Well, your brother Frank and l,
we just had a real nice visit.


145
00:11:50.912 --> 00:11:55.076
Just chit-chatting about this and that,
right over there.


146
00:11:55.483 --> 00:11:58.383
And must've been a hundred subjects
entertained--


147
00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.917
Good Lord, you know
what this stew needs?


148
00:12:05.592 --> 00:12:07.219
Dumplings?

149
00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:09.157
Noodles.

150
00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:12.895
You eat yourself some noodle stew
and your clock'll tick all night.


151
00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:16.933
You ever see that woman up in Fayette?
Suck noodles up her nose.


152
00:12:18.803 --> 00:12:20.498
-ln Fayette?
-l don't believe l have.


153
00:12:20.672 --> 00:12:23.004
You never heard of her, huh?

154
00:12:23.808 --> 00:12:26.503
You got canals up there
you never dreamed of.


155
00:12:30.681 --> 00:12:32.376
l don't like to harp on a subject--

156
00:12:32.549 --> 00:12:35.143
l don't care who comes with me.
Never have.


157
00:12:35.319 --> 00:12:37.912
That's why they call me gregarious.

158
00:12:39.288 --> 00:12:42.553
l hear you and young Stovepipe here
had a real nice visit.


159
00:12:43.025 --> 00:12:47.052
Your boys have got about a acre
of lumber to haul, dingus.


160
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.727
You better goose them down yonder.

161
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.171
<i>The James Gang committed over 25 bank,

167
00:13:24.462 --> 00:13:27.226
<i>It is so grounded inward in my heart.</i>

168
00:13:27.398 --> 00:13:29.695
<i>So for their last robbery at Blue Cut...</i>

169
00:13:29.866 --> 00:13:33.461
<i>...the brothers recruited a gang
of petty thieves and country rubes...</i>

Right on schedule, Buck!

172
00:14:57.012 --> 00:14:59.070
Snuff those lanterns!

173
00:14:59.245 --> 00:15:03.045
Look at those fools. They're gonna trip
and shoot each other into females.


174
00:15:03.216 --> 00:15:06.344
l bet you l could find them husbands
if they do.


175
00:16:51.914 --> 00:16:52.937
Fan out!

176
00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.384
Hold your fire!

177
00:17:01.355 --> 00:17:02.583
-Watch him!
-Going down.


178
00:17:16.302 --> 00:17:18.327
Hold your fire, you idiots!

179
00:17:19.504 --> 00:17:21.563
Hold your fire!

180
00:17:31.682 --> 00:17:33.411
Let me in.

181
00:17:34.117 --> 00:17:35.982
Buck! Boys!

182
00:17:36.153 --> 00:17:38.212
Buck, this way!

183
00:17:39.089 --> 00:17:41.523
Do you think that lock will hold?

184
00:17:43.092 --> 00:17:44.752
No, l don't.

185
00:17:45.126 --> 00:17:47.185
Let's go, let's go.

186
00:17:59.406 --> 00:18:02.807
Let's not get clever, nor courageous,
any of you.


187
00:18:15.187 --> 00:18:18.384
Hey there, boys!
These are all for me?


188
00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:23.659
Looks like Christmas morning in here.

189
00:18:25.496 --> 00:18:27.088
Hey, friend.

190
00:18:28.599 --> 00:18:30.590
You mind if l have a peek around?

191
00:18:31.002 --> 00:18:33.232
This shit. Nope.

192
00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:36.335
Nope.

193
00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:39.338

lt could be.

195

Open that safe.

196
00:19:03.697 --> 00:19:05.255
Do it!

197
00:19:08.769 --> 00:19:11.863
-You didn't have to bop him.
-Yeah, he did. They needed convincing.


198
00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:14.472
They got their company rules,
l got my mean streak...


199
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.131
...and that's how
we get things done around here.


200
00:19:18.243 --> 00:19:21.940
-Get on over here and attend to this thing.
-Come on, go.


201
00:19:26.084 --> 00:19:28.950

-Give me your money.


204
00:19:36.293 --> 00:19:39.227
-And you, stand up.
-Let's see your hands.


205
00:19:39.395 --> 00:19:41.124
What have you got?

206
00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:44.630
Speak English.

207
00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:49.336
Money. Money. You understand that?

208
00:19:50.906 --> 00:19:52.372
Give me your money!

209
00:20:01.816 --> 00:20:03.750
There's some receipts.

210

211
00:20:08.421 --> 00:20:11.356
Jesse. Jesse.

212
00:20:14.828 --> 00:20:16.659
Don't look good.

213
00:20:21.966 --> 00:20:25.265
There ain't no 1 00,000 dollars
in here, Dick.


214
00:20:34.144 --> 00:20:35.702
Get down on your knees.

215
00:20:36.913 --> 00:20:38.437
Why?

216
00:20:38.615 --> 00:20:40.173
Well, you ought to pray.

217
00:20:41.518 --> 00:20:42.542
l'm gonna kill you.

218
00:20:49.225 --> 00:20:50.988
Get at!

219
00:20:53.762 --> 00:20:55.627
You're gonna have to make me.

220
00:20:58.866 --> 00:21:00.527
All right.

221
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:30.220
Don't shoot him! 
No, don't shoot him.

222
00:21:41.905 --> 00:21:45.136
Don't tell me what l can
and cannot do, Ed.


223
00:21:49.011 --> 00:21:50.945
Round them up!

224
00:22:14.033 --> 00:22:17.833
<i>Chicago newspaper publishers made
a great deal of the Blue Cut train robbery...</i>

Hey.

228
00:22:27.111 --> 00:22:29.443
Can you keep a secret?

229
00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:33.209
lt depends on what you're concealing.

230
00:22:34.551 --> 00:22:36.712
You afraid of the dark?

231

No.

232
00:22:39.555 --> 00:22:41.682
You superstitious?

to keep the lightning out.


234
00:23:37.574 --> 00:23:42.238
Kid, you must've crept up on cat's paws.

235
00:23:43.178 --> 00:23:46.614
l'll wager that's the first and last time
you'll ever be caught off-guard.


236
00:23:49.885 --> 00:23:50.909
How old are you?

237
00:23:52.354 --> 00:23:53.787
Twenty.

238

Till January, so....

240
00:24:03.665 --> 00:24:05.530
l'm 1 9.

241
00:24:07.935 --> 00:24:11.097
Yeah, you feel older than that, though,
don't you?


242
00:24:15.808 --> 00:24:17.673
Yeah, l do.

243
00:24:30.655 --> 00:24:34.954
Hey, Frank, you--
You think the sheriff's out already?


244
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.723
-More than likely.
-Yeah.


245
00:24:42.665 --> 00:24:44.462
l had a real fine time tonight.

246
00:24:44.634 --> 00:24:47.864
-You think so?
-Yup. Yeah.


247
00:24:48.036 --> 00:24:51.199
Hey, l wasn't just flapping my lips
about my kid brother and me.


248
00:24:51.573 --> 00:24:56.135
What l figured was if you and Jesse could
gauge our courage and our daring...


249
00:24:56.311 --> 00:24:58.575
...you might just make us
your regular sidekicks.


250
00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:00.976
Your courage and your daring.

251
00:25:02.249 --> 00:25:07.312
l about heard all l want to about sidekicks.
You sound like your damn brother.


252
00:25:07.488 --> 00:25:11.982
Yeah. Well, l'll be square with you,
it's Bob who put me up to it. He's--


253
00:25:12.558 --> 00:25:15.857
He's got plans for the James boys
l can't even get the hang of.


254
00:25:16.028 --> 00:25:17.825
-They're that complicated.
-Yeah?


255
00:25:18.897 --> 00:25:21.559
Well, you can just
get shed of that idea.


256
00:25:21.734 --> 00:25:24.259
Because after tonight,
there'll be no more shenanigans.


257
00:25:24.936 --> 00:25:27.769
You can jot that
down in your little diary.

258
00:25:27.939 --> 00:25:32.706
September 7th, 1 881 , the James Gang
robbed one last train at Blue Cut...


259
00:25:32.877 --> 00:25:35.368
...and gave up their nightriding for good.

260
00:25:42.019 --> 00:25:43.509
Wait.

261
00:25:45.121 --> 00:25:47.646
Well, how are you gonna
make your living?


262
00:25:52.594 --> 00:25:54.994
Maybe l'll sell shoes.

263
00:26:04.805 --> 00:26:06.898
l can't believe l woke up this morning...

264
00:26:07.074 --> 00:26:10.373
...wondering if my daddy
would loan me his overcoat...


265
00:26:10.544 --> 00:26:12.409
...and here it is just past midnight...

266
00:26:12.579 --> 00:26:16.139
...l've already robbed a railroad train
and l'm sitting in a rocking chair...


267
00:26:16.315 --> 00:26:18.545
...chatting with none other
than Jesse James.


268
00:26:19.284 --> 00:26:21.912
Yeah, it's a wonderful world.

269
00:26:30.327 --> 00:26:32.158
What's this?

270
00:26:32.363 --> 00:26:34.058
Oh, yeah.

271
00:26:35.232 --> 00:26:39.293
l was real agitated this morning, so l was
wondering if l would know you or Frank...


272
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:44.600
...tell you all apart, and so l had
this clipping that described you both.


273
00:26:45.108 --> 00:26:46.837
Want me to read it?

274
00:26:47.444 --> 00:26:48.604
Go on.

275
00:26:48.778 --> 00:26:52.874
Well.... l gotta find it. Hold on.

276
00:26:53.782 --> 00:26:56.011
Here. Here.

277
00:26:56.184 --> 00:27:00.314
''Jesse James, the youngest, has a face
as smooth and innocent as a schoolgirl.

are never at rest.


279

His form is tall and graceful
and capable of great endurance...


280
00:27:08.695 --> 00:27:10.128
...and great effort.

281
00:27:10.297 --> 00:27:14.290
Jesse is lighthearted, reckless,
and devil-may-care.

-There's always a smile on his lips--''
-All right, all right, all right.


283
00:27:18.872 --> 00:27:22.671
Well, yeah, then it just-- Frank, Frank,
Frank. That's nothing. And then....


284
00:27:35.119 --> 00:27:36.984
You know what l got
right next to my bed?

l mean, many's the night l stayed up...

287
00:27:46.229 --> 00:27:48.390
...with my eyes open
and my mouth open...


288

...just reading about your escapades
in the Wide Awake Library.

They're all lies, you know.

290
00:27:58.973 --> 00:28:00.941
Yeah, of course they are.

291
00:28:04.211 --> 00:28:07.408
You don't have to keep smoking that

on speaking terms these days.

Well, l wasn't gonna mention it.

299

No, l'm just surprised a little.

Well, l never been that hungry.

305
00:30:21.233 --> 00:30:23.326
l give them names.

306
00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:26.169
Such as?

307
00:30:28.874 --> 00:30:31.365
Such as enemies.

308
00:30:32.343 --> 00:30:35.107
l give them names of enemies.

309
00:30:47.857 --> 00:30:50.917
Go tell Wood and Charley
to get their gatherings together.


310
00:30:52.361 --> 00:30:53.919
All right.

311
00:30:55.331 --> 00:30:56.889
Me too?

312
00:30:59.034 --> 00:31:01.002
You can stay.

313
00:31:03.972 --> 00:31:04.996
All right.

314
00:31:11.611 --> 00:31:12.908
Hey.

315
00:31:15.148 --> 00:31:17.844
-What do you want, peckerwood?
-Nothing.


316
00:31:18.017 --> 00:31:20.645
Except to say Jesse wants
you two to gather your parts...


317
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.344
...get on your horses
and get out of town.


318
00:31:23.655 --> 00:31:25.646
And me to stick around.

319
00:31:27.993 --> 00:31:31.087
Well, whoa, l'm his cousin...

320
00:31:31.263 --> 00:31:32.992
...l'll have you know.

321
00:31:33.165 --> 00:31:35.326
My mama's his daddy's sister.

322
00:31:35.701 --> 00:31:37.930
ls that how they described it to you,
Wood?


323
00:31:39.603 --> 00:31:41.730
You better watch your tongue,
young sapling.


324
00:31:41.905 --> 00:31:45.272
Why is it me who's gotta rattle his hocks
out of town and not you, Bunny?


325
00:31:45.442 --> 00:31:47.171
Put your horns away.
lf l know Jess...


326
00:31:47.344 --> 00:31:50.574
...there's some real nasty
sad-suzie work's gotta be done...


327
00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.847
...and Bob's the ninny
that has to do it.

328
00:31:54.016 --> 00:31:56.280
Oh, yeah, l'm sure that's it, Charley.

329
00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:02.718
You only met him 1 2 hours ago.
He doesn't even know your name.


330
00:32:03.758 --> 00:32:07.216
Wood! You tell your daddy
l'll be in Kentucky in October.


331
00:32:08.629 --> 00:32:10.995
We can hunt some birds together.

332
00:32:11.532 --> 00:32:12.965
All right.

333
00:32:13.734 --> 00:32:17.225
So how come it's
Bob who gets to stay?

334
00:32:19.805 --> 00:32:22.797
Bob's gonna move my gear to a house
down the street.


335
00:32:23.843 --> 00:32:24.867
See?

336
00:32:25.644 --> 00:32:28.168
-l don't mind.
-Yeah, well.


337
00:32:28.346 --> 00:32:30.439
Sounds like an adventure.

338
00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:38.150
<i>They moved to 1 01 7 Troost Avenue
at night...</i>


339
00:32:38.323 --> 00:32:42.759
<i>...so that the neighborhood couldn't get
a good look at them or their belongings.</i>


340
00:32:44.461 --> 00:32:47.157
<i>Then Bob thought Jesse
would give him eight hours' sleep...</i>


341
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:49.696
<i>...and a daydreaming goodbye.</i>

342
00:32:52.668 --> 00:32:55.727
<i>But with a second day
in the Thomas Howard house...</i>


343
00:32:55.904 --> 00:32:57.895
<i>...Bob thought he might never go...</i>

344
00:32:58.774 --> 00:33:02.574
<i>...but might be brought in
as a good-natured cousin to the boy...</i>


345
00:33:04.012 --> 00:33:06.775
<i>...and a gentleman helper to Zee.</i>

346
00:33:09.784 --> 00:33:11.547
<i>He went everywhere with Jesse.</i>

347
00:33:11.719 --> 00:33:13.983
<i>They made trips
to the Topeka Exchange Saloon...</i>


348
00:33:14.155 --> 00:33:17.955
<i>...where Jesse could spend nearly

349
00:33:18.124 --> 00:33:21.354
<i>...and still complain about feeling tipsy.</i>

350
00:33:22.027 --> 00:33:25.019
<i>Bob would rarely vouchsafe his opinions
as they talked.</i>


351
00:33:25.197 --> 00:33:28.724
<i>If spoken to, he would fidget and grin.</i>

352
00:33:29.468 --> 00:33:33.528
<i>If Jesse palavered with another person,
Bob secretaried their dialogue...</i>


353
00:33:33.704 --> 00:33:37.470
<i>...getting each inflection,
reading every gesture and tic...</i>


354
00:33:37.642 --> 00:33:40.839
<i>...as if he wanted to compose
a biography of the outlaw...</i>


355
00:33:41.012 --> 00:33:43.947
<i>...or as if he were preparing
an impersonation.</i>


356
00:33:59.794 --> 00:34:01.728
Go away.

357
00:34:04.566 --> 00:34:08.297
Used to be couldn't no one sneak up
on Jesse James.


358
00:34:09.637 --> 00:34:12.002
Now you think otherwise?

359
00:34:13.073 --> 00:34:16.270
l ain't never seen you without your guns,
neither.


360
00:34:29.521 --> 00:34:31.853
l can't figure it out.

361
00:34:32.757 --> 00:34:34.918
Do you wanna be like me...

362
00:34:35.359 --> 00:34:36.849
...or do you wanna be me?

363
00:34:42.766 --> 00:34:45.030
l'm just making fun, is all.

364
00:34:47.671 --> 00:34:50.935
<i>Bob was sent away cordially
the next day...</i>


365
00:34:51.107 --> 00:34:52.597
<i>...with a goodbye from Jesse...</i>

366
00:34:52.775 --> 00:34:56.711
<i>...but nothing from Zee
beyond what good manners demanded.</i>


367
00:35:00.282 --> 00:35:03.114
<i>It was 40 miles to his sister's farm
from Kansas City.</i>


368
00:35:04.418 --> 00:35:08.718
<i>And it was well into the afternoon
by the time he arrived there.</i>


369
00:35:09.724 --> 00:35:13.750
<i>Mrs. Martha Bolton rented
the Harbison farm in 1 879...</i>


370
00:35:13.927 --> 00:35:16.487
<i>...just after becoming a widow.</i>

371
00:35:16.963 --> 00:35:19.693
<i>And she made a good income
by giving rooms and meals...</i>


372
00:35:19.866 --> 00:35:25.031
<i>...to her brothers Charley, Wilbur and Bob,
and to members of the James Gang...</i>


373
00:35:25.205 --> 00:35:27.695
<i>...who would appear
whenever they needed seclusion.</i>


374
00:35:27.872 --> 00:35:29.567
Dick! You're gonna make her sick!

375
00:35:29.741 --> 00:35:32.710
She's gonna upchuck
if you don't watch out!


376
00:35:33.278 --> 00:35:36.475
<i>Wood Hite had been spurned by Martha
in his affections...</i>


377
00:35:36.648 --> 00:35:39.343
<i>...and his attempt to switch his pursuit
to her daughter...</i>


378
00:35:39.516 --> 00:35:41.416
<i>...was being thwarted by Dick Liddil.</i>

379
00:35:41.585 --> 00:35:44.884
Wait a second, you assured me
that you were not ticklish.


380
00:35:45.055 --> 00:35:46.079
Howdy!

381
00:35:46.256 --> 00:35:48.087
What's going on, now?
What's going on--?


382
00:35:48.258 --> 00:35:51.091
-Howdy!
-Were you fibbing about that?


383
00:35:51.261 --> 00:35:53.057
-No.
-Not at all.


384
00:35:54.597 --> 00:35:56.292
You're not supposed to peek, Dick.

385
00:35:56.465 --> 00:35:58.899
Well, you're just so pretty
l can't help myself.


386
00:35:59.068 --> 00:36:01.559
-You need to be warning him about that.
-Howdy.


387
00:36:01.736 --> 00:36:05.671
Worry about the field instead,
might be able to worry about the work....


388
00:36:05.839 --> 00:36:07.704
Howdy!

389
00:36:08.475 --> 00:36:11.444
-Finally home.
-l'm so glad, Bob.


390
00:36:11.612 --> 00:36:14.274
l'm in that room too, Bob.
Don't mess with my things.


391
00:36:14.448 --> 00:36:16.473
All right, Grandpa.

392
00:36:22.288 --> 00:36:27.885
''July 9th. Diligence, tact,
and a keen sense of responsibility...


393
00:36:28.061 --> 00:36:32.463
...capacity for detail are your dominant
traits. Your sense of duty's strong.''


394
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.397
How long you been there?

395
00:37:18.572 --> 00:37:21.473
Just now arrived. 
Did l miss much?

396
00:37:23.209 --> 00:37:26.645
Not unless you never seen a man
wash his dirty carcass before.


397
00:37:26.912 --> 00:37:30.313
Boy, you got a big old pecker
for being such a little squirrel.


398
00:37:30.483 --> 00:37:32.474
That what you come here to see, Dick?

399
00:37:34.387 --> 00:37:35.853
No.

400
00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:40.221
Your brother said that Jesse
kept you in Kansas City some extra days.


401
00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:41.449
What was the reason?

402
00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:47.562
Well, l'm not at liberty to say exactly.

403
00:37:47.964 --> 00:37:53.493
Let me ask you this. Did Jesse mention
that me and Cummins were in cahoots?


404
00:37:54.671 --> 00:37:55.831
ls that so?

405
00:37:56.005 --> 00:37:59.941
Oh, dear. l went on and said too much,
have l?


406
00:38:00.309 --> 00:38:02.368
Well, who else is partners with you two?

407
00:38:04.746 --> 00:38:09.240
See, he'll cut our throats if he finds out.
You don't know him like l do.


408
00:38:09.417 --> 00:38:13.409
You do Jesse dirt,
you connive behind his back...


409
00:38:13.586 --> 00:38:16.384
...boy, he'll come after you
with a cleaver.


410
00:38:19.092 --> 00:38:21.583
So, what are you two cahoots
cooking up?


411
00:38:24.597 --> 00:38:26.223
Don't know that l should say.

412
00:38:27.399 --> 00:38:29.492
l'm not gonna wheedle
the dang news from you.


413
00:38:29.668 --> 00:38:31.431
How about we'll leave it a mystery...

414
00:38:31.704 --> 00:38:35.902
...and then we won't neither one of us
regret our little chat?


415
00:38:41.611 --> 00:38:44.375
Can you hand me that six-gun there, Bob?

416
00:38:53.456 --> 00:38:57.586
lf you so much as mention my name
to Jesse...


417
00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.092
...boy, l'll find out about it.

418
00:39:00.262 --> 00:39:03.254
You had better believe that.

419
00:39:03.432 --> 00:39:05.456
And l'll look you up.

420
00:39:05.633 --> 00:39:10.536
l'll knock on your door,
and l will be as mad as a hornet.


421
00:39:11.272 --> 00:39:13.433
l will be hot.

422
00:39:15.342 --> 00:39:18.105
You be careful with that iron, Dick.

423
00:39:26.419 --> 00:39:30.013
You know where l stand on these matters
and that's all there is to it.


424
00:39:30.188 --> 00:39:33.783
Me and you can be as friendly as pigs
from now on.


425
00:39:59.281 --> 00:40:02.739
l'm Bunny Ford, stick your hands
up in the air!


426
00:40:02.918 --> 00:40:04.613
Mister.

427
00:40:09.891 --> 00:40:12.121
Oh, you have some nerve.

428
00:40:13.428 --> 00:40:18.832
We were just reading about the James boys
among the Mexicans.


429
00:40:20.567 --> 00:40:23.228
What's this? This ain't Jesse.

430
00:40:23.402 --> 00:40:26.530
-You don't know that.
-He would've never wore no mustache.


431
00:40:26.705 --> 00:40:29.071
Never was anywheres near a cannon.

432
00:40:29.241 --> 00:40:31.675
Let me see that picture.

433
00:40:31.844 --> 00:40:34.573
Boy, l can't even calculate
what l'm looking at.


434
00:40:34.813 --> 00:40:36.940
-Give me that.
-Ever since he was a child...


435
00:40:37.115 --> 00:40:40.312
...Bob's collected whatsoever he could find
about the James brothers.


436
00:40:40.485 --> 00:40:42.680
Yeah, got himself a little museum
in his room.


437
00:40:42.854 --> 00:40:46.449
Next time you come snooping around,
you better strap on a shooting iron!


438
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:49.481
Well, you can see how scared l am.

439
00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:53.528
You too, Wood Hite. Cross me again,
l'll put a bullet through your head!


440
00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:55.724
Boy, you--

441
00:40:56.399 --> 00:40:59.061
Son, you better recollect
who my cousin is...


442
00:40:59.235 --> 00:41:03.295
...because you've seemed to misremembered
that Jesse loves me like the Good Book.


443
00:41:03.472 --> 00:41:07.101
Now, you may play it like you're
a dangerous person in the grocery store...


444
00:41:07.275 --> 00:41:09.675
...but don't misremember
who you be accounting to...


445
00:41:09.845 --> 00:41:12.278
-...if l so much get my feelings hurt.
-l don't care!


446
00:41:12.446 --> 00:41:14.004
Do l have to yell ''suwee''?

447
00:41:14.181 --> 00:41:16.149
Why don't we make up,
be pleasant for once?


448
00:41:16.317 --> 00:41:19.150
Why don't we pass the evening
like pleasant human beings?


449
00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.584
l like your nickel suit, cowboy.

450
00:41:47.411 --> 00:41:49.174
You see something?

451
00:41:50.414 --> 00:41:52.210
Just a bird.

452
00:41:55.985 --> 00:41:57.885
<i>The month of October came...</i>

453
00:41:58.053 --> 00:42:01.489
<i>...and Jesse began seeing
Pinkerton operatives in every floor walker...</i>


454
00:42:01.657 --> 00:42:06.059
<i>...street sweeper, and common man
poking about in a store.</i>


455
00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:10.854
<i>On the morning of the 1 1 th,
he would wake his wife...</i>


456
00:42:11.032 --> 00:42:15.230
<i>...with the Scripture pertaining to
the Holy Family's flight into Egypt.</i>


457
00:42:18.972 --> 00:42:23.875
<i>Overnight, the Thomas Howard clan
vanished from Kansas City.</i>


458
00:42:34.352 --> 00:42:37.014
<i>Shortly thereafter,
four of the Blue Cut train robbers...</i>


459
00:42:37.188 --> 00:42:40.021
<i>...were arrested in shacks near Glendale.</i>

460
00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:48.759
<i>How Jesse could have known
remains a mystery.</i>


461
00:43:00.809 --> 00:43:03.801
<i>Theirs was a wandering existence.</i>

462
00:43:03.979 --> 00:43:05.674
<i>Men who choose to be outlaws...</i>

463
00:43:05.847 --> 00:43:09.782
<i>...cannot afford to remain in one place
for very long.</i>


464
00:43:18.826 --> 00:43:23.091
-Well, goodness. Maybe l'll change my mind.
-Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.


465
00:43:23.263 --> 00:43:25.493
-Martha.
-Buck up, man.


466
00:43:25.665 --> 00:43:29.226
<i>Wood and Dick would bicker
across the entire state of Kentucky...</i>


467
00:43:29.402 --> 00:43:34.361
<i>...until they made Russellville, home
of Major George Hite, Wood's father...</i>


468
00:43:34.539 --> 00:43:37.667
<i>...and uncle to Frank and Jesse James.</i>

469
00:43:45.749 --> 00:43:47.910
You stay away from this one.

470
00:43:48.685 --> 00:43:50.710
She's my daddy's wife.

471
00:43:51.655 --> 00:43:52.986
You got it?

472
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:18.537
Did you cook this, ma'am?

473
00:44:21.849 --> 00:44:24.112
l've got a nigger woman.

474
00:44:26.219 --> 00:44:27.243
How's that?

475
00:44:31.691 --> 00:44:35.058
Dick asked if l cooked this.

476
00:44:35.294 --> 00:44:36.784
Did you?

477
00:44:39.363 --> 00:44:40.387
No.

478
00:44:49.607 --> 00:44:52.040
She knew what he was like
when she married him.


479
00:45:18.565 --> 00:45:22.797
l guess we're the
night owls, you and l.

480
00:45:24.204 --> 00:45:26.035
l'm glad.

481
00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:29.773
How come?

482
00:45:30.776 --> 00:45:33.370
You're interesting to look at.

483
00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.772
You have a real pleasant disposition.

484
00:45:39.418 --> 00:45:43.353
And l don't know, you sort of
make me feel warm all over.


485
00:45:45.355 --> 00:45:50.019
You know, l'm what they call a--
An inamorato.


486
00:45:53.896 --> 00:45:58.595
Well, l knew
there had to be a name for it.


487
00:46:02.438 --> 00:46:04.599
You and the Hites
don't get along too well...


488
00:46:04.774 --> 00:46:08.038
...if l'm to trust Wood and his version
of the situation.


489
00:46:09.211 --> 00:46:12.738
We hate each other like poison,
if you wanna know the truth.


490
00:46:13.415 --> 00:46:17.112
Most of the Hites wouldn't spit on me
if l was on fire.


491
00:46:19.352 --> 00:46:22.150
They say that when a woman's on fire...

492
00:46:22.322 --> 00:46:26.759
...you're supposed to roll her around on
the ground and cover her with your body.


493
00:46:28.094 --> 00:46:30.824
Well, you are a naughty tease.

494
00:46:37.369 --> 00:46:39.701
lsn't it about bedtime?

495
00:46:41.039 --> 00:46:43.906
Well, l'll just kiss those dainty nubbins.

496
00:46:57.853 --> 00:46:59.252
Good night.

497
00:47:13.701 --> 00:47:14.793
Would you stop?

498
00:47:20.073 --> 00:47:24.099
Boy, l believe l drank too much coffee.

499
00:47:27.814 --> 00:47:31.147
l gotta go visit the privy
something terrible.


500
00:48:00.443 --> 00:48:02.740
This is embarrassing.

501
00:48:03.412 --> 00:48:07.473
Now, you go ahead and do your duty.
l don't mind.


502
00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:12.711
l've sort of got stage fright with
a strange man in the commode with me.


503
00:48:12.888 --> 00:48:14.412
l ain't strange.

504
00:48:14.722 --> 00:48:17.623
l'm built just like the rest of them.

505
00:48:20.361 --> 00:48:23.455
You look awful pretty.

506
00:48:24.865 --> 00:48:26.628
Do l?

507
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.663
l haven't never in my life seen
such well-shaped limbs.


508
00:48:39.245 --> 00:48:41.371
ls Wood awake?

509
00:48:43.615 --> 00:48:44.877
lt's just me.

510
00:48:53.724 --> 00:48:56.659
And l bet you
thought l was a lady.

511
00:49:43.468 --> 00:49:45.799
Well, you ain't much of a housekeeper,
are you?


512
00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:50.835
You didn't just happen by.

513
00:49:53.244 --> 00:49:54.939
Why not?

514
00:50:22.203 --> 00:50:25.103
Go on and take
a load off your feet.

515
00:50:50.127 --> 00:50:52.186
You ought to get yourself a wife.

516
00:50:52.563 --> 00:50:53.928
Yeah.

517
00:50:54.164 --> 00:50:55.995
l suppose.

518
00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:02.600
l was gonna ask Martha. 
Charley's sister.

519
00:51:02.772 --> 00:51:06.139
l was gonna ask her
if she could imagine it.


520
00:51:07.376 --> 00:51:10.243
But l guess Wood
has plans of his own.

521
00:51:10.846 --> 00:51:13.474
And there's always Dick Liddil
getting in the way.


522
00:51:14.582 --> 00:51:16.550
l'll give it some thought, though.

523
00:51:17.318 --> 00:51:19.286
Your crops come in?

524
00:51:20.488 --> 00:51:25.585
No, l don't got much.
Just a garden patch and a pasture.


525
00:51:27.861 --> 00:51:30.227
l was sick at planting time.

526
00:51:31.231 --> 00:51:32.630
So....

527
00:51:34.834 --> 00:51:37.166
Ed, how you feeling now?

528
00:51:40.004 --> 00:51:41.062
Why?

529
00:51:42.974 --> 00:51:45.169
You're acting queer.

530
00:51:53.683 --> 00:51:57.346
Well, you and me ain't been
just real good friends lately.


531
00:51:58.321 --> 00:52:01.415
That's not your fault,
you understand that.


532
00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.386
You hear talk, though.

533
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:08.920
Talk?

534
00:52:12.734 --> 00:52:14.964
People tell you things.

535
00:52:22.509 --> 00:52:24.602
Why don't you give me an example?

536
00:52:28.916 --> 00:52:31.042
Jim Cummins come by here.

537
00:52:32.685 --> 00:52:34.016
Jim Cummins.

538
00:52:35.221 --> 00:52:37.519
Oh, and Jim says:

539
00:52:40.059 --> 00:52:43.755
''You know them boys
that got caught in the Blue Cut deal?''


540
00:52:46.831 --> 00:52:50.460
Well, Jim says he got word...

541
00:52:53.137 --> 00:52:57.197
...that you're planning to kill them.

542
00:52:59.042 --> 00:53:01.306
Why would l do that?

543
00:53:03.246 --> 00:53:05.373
That's just talk probably.

544
00:53:09.384 --> 00:53:13.218
Jim Cummins. He say anything else?

545
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:17.457
Nope. No, that was it, basically.

546
00:53:27.868 --> 00:53:30.268
That still don't explain why you're scared.

547
00:53:33.907 --> 00:53:36.773
Well, l'm in the same situation, you see.

548
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:39.535
l was terrified l saw you ride up.

549
00:53:40.179 --> 00:53:43.171
-l just happened by, Ed.
-Suppose you heard gossip, though.


550
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:46.284
Suppose you heard Jim Cummins
come by, you might have thought...


551
00:53:46.452 --> 00:53:51.411
...that we were planning to capture you
or get that reward, and that ain't true.


552
00:53:51.588 --> 00:53:53.886
But you might have suspected it.

553
00:54:12.241 --> 00:54:14.834
Haven't heard a lick of gossip lately.

554
00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:19.447
l got 600 dollars stashed away.
l don't need no governor's reward.


555
00:54:22.349 --> 00:54:24.283
Well, it's the principle too.

556
00:54:29.289 --> 00:54:30.779
Well....

557
00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:34.582
-l'm glad l stopped by.
-Oh, me too.


558
00:54:59.382 --> 00:55:02.442
What do you say
if we were to go for a ride?


559
00:55:07.389 --> 00:55:10.256
We can go into
town. l'll buy you dinner.

560
00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:14.158
Then l'll be on my way.

561
00:55:23.137 --> 00:55:24.866
Okay.

562
00:56:25.293 --> 00:56:27.022
You ready to go for a ride?

563
00:56:42.808 --> 00:56:45.174
We going to your place?

564
00:56:50.014 --> 00:56:52.141
You seen Ed Miller lately?

565
00:56:53.518 --> 00:56:55.645
Nobody has.

566
00:56:59.456 --> 00:57:02.050
Must have gone off to California.

567
00:57:06.095 --> 00:57:08.427
l'd still like to know where we're going.

568
00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:17.503
lf you were going to see Jim Cummins,
wouldn't you follow this road?


569
00:57:22.944 --> 00:57:24.775
l guess so.

570
00:58:07.716 --> 00:58:09.183
Howdy.

571
00:58:20.061 --> 00:58:22.188
Oh, are you friends of my pa's?

572
00:58:27.268 --> 00:58:29.098
We're friends of Jim Cummins.

573
00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:36.141
Well, it so happens
he's been gone since August.


574
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:38.368
And never said where he gone to.

575
00:58:43.281 --> 00:58:46.512
-l'm Matt Collins.
-Albert Ford.


576
00:58:46.684 --> 00:58:48.652
Very happy to meet you.

577
00:58:54.359 --> 00:58:57.850
-Dick Turpin.
-Pleased to make your acquaintance.


578
00:59:10.573 --> 00:59:12.564
l don't know where he is!
Leave me alone!


579
00:59:12.741 --> 00:59:14.504
Shut your mouth!
You shut your mouth!


580
00:59:16.478 --> 00:59:19.345
-You shut your mouth.
-l don't know where he is!


581
00:59:20.048 --> 00:59:22.072
-l don't know!
-Get in there.


582
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:23.974
Shut up.

583
00:59:24.151 --> 00:59:26.642
-l don't know where he is!
-Shut up.


584
00:59:27.721 --> 00:59:29.188
-l don't know!
-Shut up.


585
00:59:29.356 --> 00:59:30.414
-Jesus.
-Shut up.


586
00:59:30.591 --> 00:59:32.684
Jesse, he's just a kid.

587
00:59:33.092 --> 00:59:36.755
He knows where his uncle Jim is and
that's gonna make him old soon enough.


588
00:59:36.930 --> 00:59:39.228
-Maybe he doesn't know.
-He knows!


589
00:59:39.399 --> 00:59:41.060
You need to ask and ask sometimes.

590
00:59:41.234 --> 00:59:44.863
Sometimes a child don't remember so much
at first. But it'll come back to him.


591
00:59:46.904 --> 00:59:49.429
My goodness, she's about to rip off,
sweetie.


592
00:59:49.607 --> 00:59:51.598
Just a little more
here to get her started.

593
00:59:51.776 --> 00:59:54.540
Then l think l can rip her off
like a page from a book.


594
00:59:54.712 --> 00:59:56.805
Jesus, he can't even talk.

595
00:59:59.649 --> 01:00:01.207
Where's Jim?

596
01:00:01.384 --> 01:00:02.851
Where's Jim?

597
01:00:03.019 --> 01:00:04.987
Where's Jim? Where's Jim?

598
01:00:05.155 --> 01:00:08.522
Where's Jim? Where's Jim? Where's Jim?

599
01:00:08.859 --> 01:00:11.123
-Where's Jim?
-Quit it!


600
01:00:11.627 --> 01:00:14.027
You bastard! l don't know where he is!

601
01:00:14.196 --> 01:00:17.063
You won't believe me!
You never even gave me a chance!


602
01:00:17.232 --> 01:00:19.223
You kept my-
- You kept my mouth shut!

603
01:00:20.602 --> 01:00:24.003
l never know where Jim is or
when he comes! So leave me alone.


604
01:00:24.172 --> 01:00:26.605
Get off me, you son of a bitch!

605
01:01:19.655 --> 01:01:21.589
l'm worn out.

606
01:01:21.822 --> 01:01:24.689
l can't. No, see....

607
01:01:27.728 --> 01:01:30.287
My mind's all tangled anyway.

608
01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:34.288
Little deals like this
just make me feel dirty.


609
01:01:55.352 --> 01:01:57.377
Are you all right, Jesse?

610
01:02:25.946 --> 01:02:27.777
<i>Jesse was sick...</i>

611
01:02:27.948 --> 01:02:32.407
<i>...with rheums, and aches
and lung congestions.</i>


612
01:02:33.286 --> 01:02:36.585
<i>Insomnia stained
his eye sockets like soot.</i>


613
01:02:37.423 --> 01:02:40.415
<i>He read auguries in
the snarled intestines of chickens...</i>


614
01:02:41.628 --> 01:02:45.188
<i>...or the blow of cat hair
released to the wind.</i>


615
01:02:45.998 --> 01:02:50.958
<i>And the omens promised bad luck,
which moated and dungeoned him.</i>


616
01:03:32.673 --> 01:03:35.233
How come it's you
that's gotta do all the chores?


617
01:03:35.409 --> 01:03:39.640
Charley and Bob pay extry to Martha
so that they don't have to.


618
01:03:40.946 --> 01:03:43.005
lt still don't seem fair.

619
01:03:49.788 --> 01:03:51.312
Martha.

620
01:03:53.058 --> 01:03:55.652
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

621
01:04:00.465 --> 01:04:01.727
You come from Kentucky?

622
01:04:05.134 --> 01:04:08.968
Why do you have your head in a hole,
Martha?


623
01:04:12.008 --> 01:04:15.738
Wood and Dick had a shooting scrape
a few months ago.


624
01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:18.574
Cover the kettle, lda.

625
01:04:23.852 --> 01:04:26.150
And what did you and Dick
get in a scrape about?


626
01:04:30.024 --> 01:04:34.017
Well, he tampered
with my daddy's wife...


627
01:04:34.195 --> 01:04:37.562
...while a pork chop
burned on the skillet...


628
01:04:37.731 --> 01:04:39.255
...so l shot at him.

629
01:04:44.336 --> 01:04:48.739
lda! Do not stick your thumb
in the cream when you skim it.


630
01:04:49.908 --> 01:04:55.106
His chicanery and his philandering ways...

631
01:04:55.279 --> 01:04:57.247
...has instigated such malice.

632
01:04:57.415 --> 01:05:01.351
He's a yellow snake in the grass
and he can't be trusted, Martha.


633
01:05:04.255 --> 01:05:07.621
Dick told me a complete other version
of that affray.


634
01:05:09.091 --> 01:05:11.753
Wood Hite's downstairs.

635
01:05:12.461 --> 01:05:14.156
You mean he's here?

636
01:05:16.932 --> 01:05:19.627
Yeah, he come in late last night.

637
01:05:23.338 --> 01:05:24.362
Hey, simmer down!

638
01:05:24.539 --> 01:05:29.101
Don't get into a fracas up there, you boys!
l've got breakfast almost ready.


639
01:07:39.993 --> 01:07:42.188
He's still sucking air.

640
01:07:43.363 --> 01:07:45.558
But l think he's a goner.

641
01:07:55.706 --> 01:07:59.005
Maybe y'all better come wish him well
on his journey.


642
01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.267
Wood?

643
01:08:29.704 --> 01:08:31.967
You were a good fellow, Wood.

644
01:08:32.205 --> 01:08:35.697
Oh, l sure hope you're not
in frightful pain, Wood.


645
01:08:36.276 --> 01:08:40.007
l'd get you something to drink,
but l'm afraid you'd just choke on it.


646
01:08:41.381 --> 01:08:43.541
Little lda's gonna miss you.

647
01:08:43.716 --> 01:08:45.843
So is the rest of the family.

648
01:08:49.121 --> 01:08:52.750
Well, one thing's settled.
Can't take him into Richmond.


649
01:08:53.826 --> 01:08:54.884
Why not?

650
01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:58.920
Well, one, sheriff'll put Bob in jail.

651
01:08:59.096 --> 01:09:02.964
And two, Jesse'll find out his cousin
Wood's been shot in our house...


652
01:09:03.133 --> 01:09:06.534
...and then that'll be the end
of each and every one of us.


653
01:09:16.446 --> 01:09:20.109
''And in one merciless, violent thrust
broke in...


654
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:23.382
...and carried all before him,
and scented and brewed...


655
01:09:23.552 --> 01:09:26.077
...reeking with blood of my virginity...

656
01:09:26.254 --> 01:09:30.782
...up to its utmost length in my body.''

657
01:09:32.393 --> 01:09:35.259
He ain't disappeared,
if that's what you were hoping.


658
01:09:39.733 --> 01:09:41.701
What chapter you on?

659
01:09:42.202 --> 01:09:47.230
She's met some Algerian corsair
down at Gibraltar.


660
01:09:47.407 --> 01:09:49.704
Got herself all agitated.

661
01:09:52.044 --> 01:09:53.477
How's that leg?

662
01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:58.443
Full of torment, Bob. 
Thanks for asking.

663
01:10:44.323 --> 01:10:46.985
<i>Blessed are the poor in spirit...</i>

664
01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.424
<i>...for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</i>

665
01:10:50.863 --> 01:10:56.425
Blessed are them that mourn,
for they shall be comforted.


666
01:10:58.570 --> 01:11:00.504
Blessed are the....

667
01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:05.564
Meek.

668
01:11:07.844 --> 01:11:09.675
Blessed are the meek.

669
01:11:45.644 --> 01:11:47.703
-ls it him?
-Yeah.


670
01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:50.906
Why is he here? Does he know
about Wood, do you think?


671
01:11:51.083 --> 01:11:53.483
l don't know. All l know is
he don't miss very much.


672
01:11:53.652 --> 01:11:57.610
-What should l say about you if he asks?
-Tell him l'm in K.C. with Mattie.


673
01:12:00.325 --> 01:12:04.125
He was buffalo hunting.
He was thrilled to meet yours truly.


674
01:12:04.295 --> 01:12:08.231
Yeah, over there in Europe there's only
two Americans they know for certain...


675
01:12:08.397 --> 01:12:11.332
...Mark Twain and Jesse James.

676
01:12:12.702 --> 01:12:15.933
-Why, it's the kid.
-How's everything?


677
01:12:18.374 --> 01:12:20.968
-l never take off my gun belts.
-Yeah?


678
01:12:21.143 --> 01:12:22.701
Good thinking.

679
01:12:28.817 --> 01:12:31.081
Well, Charley, did you hurt your leg?

680
01:12:33.622 --> 01:12:35.646
Yeah, l slipped--
l slipped off the roof...


681
01:12:35.823 --> 01:12:39.418
...and l smacked down into a snow bank
like a ton of stupidness.


682
01:12:39.593 --> 01:12:42.255
One second l'm screaming,
''Whoa, Nelly!''


683
01:12:42.428 --> 01:12:45.090
Next second, poof,
l'm neck-deep in snow.


684
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.834
Well, whatever possessed you
to climb a roof in December?


685
01:12:57.843 --> 01:13:01.300
There was a k-- A kite. What am l saying?
There was a cat.


686
01:13:01.479 --> 01:13:03.879
A cat. lt was on the roof
and l went after him.


687
01:13:04.048 --> 01:13:08.576
lt was a tomcat yowling
and what all, and l slipped.


688
01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:23.623
l thought maybe your club foot
was gaining on you.


689
01:13:32.674 --> 01:13:34.301
Oh, yeah.

690
01:13:35.076 --> 01:13:39.307
Dick went to Kansas City to be
with his wife. He was here for a bit.


691
01:13:58.930 --> 01:14:01.831
Hey, here's a cute story, Jess.

692
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.366
Bobby was what, 1 1 or 1 2...

693
01:14:05.536 --> 01:14:08.699
...and you were by far
his most admired personage.


694
01:14:09.206 --> 01:14:10.366
He couldn't get enough.

695
01:14:10.541 --> 01:14:14.739
lt was ''Jesse this'' and ''Jesse that''
and ''Jesse this'' from sunrise to sunset.


696
01:14:14.912 --> 01:14:16.038
Fascinating.

697
01:14:16.213 --> 01:14:17.941
No, there's more. This is cute.

698
01:14:18.113 --> 01:14:22.880
We're at supper and Bob asks,
''You know what size boot Jesse wears?''


699
01:14:23.051 --> 01:14:26.782
-Charley, Jesse doesn't wanna hear this.
-Shush, now, Bob, let me tell it.


700
01:14:26.955 --> 01:14:29.980
Bob says-- He says, ''You know
what size boot Jesse wears?''


701
01:14:30.157 --> 01:14:33.320
He says, ''Six and a half.'' He says,
''Ain't that a big enough boot...


702
01:14:33.494 --> 01:14:35.291
...for a man 5'8'' tall?''

703
01:14:35.463 --> 01:14:39.297
l decided to josh him a little, you know,
he being my kid brother and everything.


704
01:14:39.467 --> 01:14:42.560
So l said, ''He
doesn't have toes is why.''

705
01:14:42.736 --> 01:14:44.260
That's a really stupid story.

706
01:14:44.437 --> 01:14:49.033
''He was dangling his feet off a culvert
and a catfish nibbled his toes off.''


707
01:14:49.209 --> 01:14:51.939
Bob taxed himself trying to picture it.

708
01:14:58.816 --> 01:15:01.478
That'd be a good
joke if it was funny.

709
01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.845
lsn't that a cute story, Jess?

710
01:15:14.731 --> 01:15:17.598
Give me some more conversations, Bob.

711
01:15:22.671 --> 01:15:27.836
l got one. This one's about as crackerjack--
lt's the one about your--


712
01:15:28.009 --> 01:15:29.909
Let Bob tell it.

713
01:15:31.279 --> 01:15:33.075
All right.

714
01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:41.611
l don't even know
what you're talking about.


715
01:15:41.789 --> 01:15:45.782
About how you and Jesse
have so much in common.


716
01:15:48.828 --> 01:15:50.489
Go on, Bob.

717
01:15:50.663 --> 01:15:52.631
Yeah, come on, Bob.

718
01:15:53.366 --> 01:15:55.630
Tell us a story.

719
01:15:57.569 --> 01:16:02.164
-Nope. No.
-Come on, entertain Jesse. He's here.


720
01:16:09.113 --> 01:16:10.637
Come on.

721
01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:21.422
Well, if you'll pardon my saying so,
l guess...


722
01:16:21.591 --> 01:16:25.651
...it is interesting the many ways
you and l overlap and whatnot.


723
01:16:26.962 --> 01:16:29.726
l mean, you begin with our daddies.

724
01:16:29.897 --> 01:16:32.866
Your daddy was a pastor
at the New Hope Baptist Church...


725
01:16:33.034 --> 01:16:37.766
...and my daddy was a pastor
at the church in Excelsior Springs.


726
01:16:39.206 --> 01:16:43.540
You're the youngest of three James boys,
and l'm the youngest of five Ford boys.


727
01:16:45.345 --> 01:16:48.007
Between Charley and me,
there's another brother, Wilbur...


728
01:16:48.181 --> 01:16:50.205
...with six letters in his name.

729
01:16:50.549 --> 01:16:56.146
And between Frank and you, is another
brother Robert, also with six letters.


730
01:16:56.355 --> 01:17:00.086
And my Christian name
is Robert, of course.


731
01:17:01.426 --> 01:17:03.586
You have blue eyes, l have blue eyes.

732
01:17:03.761 --> 01:17:07.754
You're 5'8'' tall, l'm 5'8'' tall.

733
01:17:12.503 --> 01:17:17.872
Me, l must have had a list as long as
your nightshirt when l was 1 2, but...


734
01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:21.476
...l seem to have lost some curiosities
over the years.


735
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:42.144
Ain't he something?

736
01:17:54.730 --> 01:17:58.928
Did l ever tell you the story about
that scalawag, George Shepherd?


737
01:17:59.234 --> 01:18:01.134
Shepherd's one of
Quantrill's lieutenants.


738
01:18:01.303 --> 01:18:03.999
He give me a story much like Bob's
what bring him to mind.


739
01:18:04.472 --> 01:18:06.996
Going on about how much
we had in common, and so on...


740
01:18:07.173 --> 01:18:09.698
...so he could get in the gang.

741
01:18:09.876 --> 01:18:13.004
How could l have known
he had a grudge against me?


742
01:18:13.179 --> 01:18:17.673
How could l have known
he was lying to get on my good side?


743
01:18:17.851 --> 01:18:22.844
l said, ''George, come on aboard.
Glad to have you.''


744
01:18:23.022 --> 01:18:27.823
George thought he was smart,
except he wasn't.


745
01:18:28.761 --> 01:18:31.889
One morning, George rides into camp...

746
01:18:32.064 --> 01:18:34.258
...and about 20 guns open up on him.

747
01:18:38.068 --> 01:18:42.528
See, old George, he only had one eye. You
gotta have two eyes, you wanna get Jesse.


748
01:18:47.376 --> 01:18:50.504
You ought not think of me
like you do George Shepherd.


749
01:18:51.847 --> 01:18:54.077
You brought him to mind.

750
01:18:55.017 --> 01:18:57.315
Well, it's not very flattering.

751
01:19:03.291 --> 01:19:06.089
Sure is good eating, Martha.

752
01:19:06.961 --> 01:19:09.191
Well, l'm so glad you enjoyed it.

753
01:19:09.363 --> 01:19:11.523
How come George
had a grudge against you?


754
01:19:16.436 --> 01:19:20.532
l said, how come George
had a grudge against you?


755
01:19:26.244 --> 01:19:30.977
Well, you see, George had a nephew
he wanted me to protect during the war.


756
01:19:31.149 --> 01:19:33.379
This nephew had 5000 dollars on him.

757
01:19:33.552 --> 01:19:38.147
lt just so happens he winds up killed
and someone swipes that money.


758
01:19:38.322 --> 01:19:42.190
And when George is in prison,
someone whispers to him:


759
01:19:42.358 --> 01:19:46.089
''lt was Jesse James
slit the boy's throat.''


760
01:19:50.833 --> 01:19:53.301
lt was just mean gossip, was it?

761
01:19:55.104 --> 01:19:58.403
Bob's the expert. 
Let's put it to him.

762
01:20:03.478 --> 01:20:05.878
Oh, dear, l made him cranky.

763
01:20:06.047 --> 01:20:09.847
l'm not cranky. l just been
through this before is all.


764
01:20:10.017 --> 01:20:13.180
Most people get around on making fun
of me. They don't ever let up.


765
01:20:13.354 --> 01:20:15.412
Someone's getting awful fresh over there.

766
01:20:15.588 --> 01:20:18.284
Woman, shut your face for once.

767
01:20:25.297 --> 01:20:27.628
Don't want you to skip off
to your room and pout...


768
01:20:27.799 --> 01:20:30.324
...without knowing why l come by
for this visit.


769
01:20:31.136 --> 01:20:33.366
Why? So you could
tell us how sorry you are...


770
01:20:33.538 --> 01:20:36.098
...you had to slap our cousin Albert around?

771
01:20:49.719 --> 01:20:51.550
l come by...

772
01:20:51.721 --> 01:20:55.121
...to ask if one of you two Fords...

773
01:20:55.323 --> 01:20:58.690
...would care to ride with me
in a journey or two.


774
01:20:59.094 --> 01:21:02.461
l guess we both agree
it ought to be Charley.


775
01:21:02.631 --> 01:21:05.429
You've been acting sort of testy.

776
01:21:36.527 --> 01:21:38.757
Have you seen Wood Hite lately?

777
01:21:39.263 --> 01:21:42.790
No. Not at all.

778
01:21:50.774 --> 01:21:53.436
l swear that stew
had some squirrel meat in it.


779
01:21:53.609 --> 01:21:56.305
-Still arguing with you, is it?
-Yeah.


780
01:21:57.079 --> 01:21:59.012
-You're Charles Ford?
-Yes, ma'am.


781
01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:01.239
You've seen me once or twice before.

782
01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:04.518
l got a letter from George Hite.

783
01:22:05.153 --> 01:22:08.054
He hasn't seen hide nor hair of him.

784
01:22:09.557 --> 01:22:11.751
And you say you haven't seen Wood?

785
01:22:12.492 --> 01:22:15.655
No, l-- l can't
imagine where he could be.

786
01:22:43.202 --> 01:22:44.226
Yeah?

787
01:22:45.404 --> 01:22:47.565
You finished with your sleeping?

788
01:22:49.074 --> 01:22:51.599
l could use a couple more hours
if it's no trouble.


789
01:23:03.252 --> 01:23:04.810
Yeah.

790
01:23:08.458 --> 01:23:12.895
l been holding a discussion with myself
over if l ought to tell you this or no.


791
01:23:13.062 --> 01:23:15.723
My good side won out and....

792
01:23:16.932 --> 01:23:19.833
Well, l wanna make a clean breast
of things.


793
01:23:20.936 --> 01:23:25.100
Yeah, my mind's a little cobwebby
is the only drawback.


794
01:23:25.273 --> 01:23:30.073
l could use a little--
A little more sleep.


795
01:23:32.612 --> 01:23:34.637
You know l went to Kentucky?

796
01:23:35.615 --> 01:23:37.048
Yeah.

797
01:23:37.751 --> 01:23:40.184
l come back through Saline County and...

798
01:23:41.587 --> 01:23:43.452
...l think to myself:

799
01:23:43.989 --> 01:23:48.756
''Why not stop by and see Ed Miller?''

800
01:23:50.929 --> 01:23:52.657
So l do.

801
01:23:56.501 --> 01:23:59.834
Well, things are not to my satisfaction.

802
01:24:01.972 --> 01:24:04.736
Ed's got himself all worked up
over something.


803
01:24:06.275 --> 01:24:09.540
l can see that
he's lying like a rug.

804
01:24:12.882 --> 01:24:15.976
So l say to myself, ''
Enough's enough.''

805
01:24:16.485 --> 01:24:19.282
And l say to Ed, ''Come on, Ed.

806
01:24:20.221 --> 01:24:22.553
Let's go for a ride.''

807
01:24:24.359 --> 01:24:27.260
You understand what l'm saying?

808
01:24:28.496 --> 01:24:31.464
Going for a ride is like....

809
01:24:32.533 --> 01:24:35.661
Going for a ride
is like giving him what-for?


810
01:24:37.637 --> 01:24:39.366
Exactly.

811
01:24:43.842 --> 01:24:45.309
So...

812
01:24:48.013 --> 01:24:49.878
...Ed and Jesse...

813
01:24:52.284 --> 01:24:54.548
...they argue on the road.

814
01:24:58.989 --> 01:25:01.321
Did you ever count the stars?

815
01:25:04.795 --> 01:25:08.731
l can't ever get the same number.
They keep changing on me.


816
01:25:10.599 --> 01:25:13.625
l don't even know
what a star is exactly.

817
01:25:16.338 --> 01:25:18.533
Well, your body knows.

818
01:25:19.441 --> 01:25:21.908
lt's your mind that forgot.

819
01:25:31.686 --> 01:25:34.745
You go on ahead, partner.
l'll catch up with you.


820
01:26:14.956 --> 01:26:16.787
lt's okay.

821
01:26:39.612 --> 01:26:43.070
lt's okay, sweetheart. lt's okay.

822
01:26:46.084 --> 01:26:48.552
And when push came to shove...

823
01:26:55.426 --> 01:26:57.826
...Jesse shot and killed him.

824
01:27:01.165 --> 01:27:03.030
Jesse did.

825
01:27:05.502 --> 01:27:07.231
You got it.

826
01:27:09.339 --> 01:27:10.704
You....

827
01:27:27.288 --> 01:27:29.256
So, you see, your--

828
01:27:29.457 --> 01:27:31.924
Your cousin, he got off easy.

829
01:27:32.092 --> 01:27:33.684
l was just playing with Albert.

830
01:27:35.195 --> 01:27:38.858
Yeah, l made him squeal
once or twice myself.


831
01:27:39.166 --> 01:27:42.226
l'm just not as thorough as you are.

832
01:27:53.511 --> 01:27:56.536
You got a tale
to swap with me now?

833
01:28:05.322 --> 01:28:07.722
l don't get your meaning.

834
01:28:09.792 --> 01:28:15.094
Seems to me, if you have something
to confess in exchange...


835
01:28:15.264 --> 01:28:17.425
...it'd only be right...

836
01:28:18.334 --> 01:28:21.666
...that you'd spit it out now.

837
01:28:33.481 --> 01:28:35.607
l can't think of a single thing.

838
01:28:38.518 --> 01:28:41.282
About Wood Hite, for example.

839
01:28:41.454 --> 01:28:46.289
l'm not gonna-- l been saying over and
over l can't figure out where he's gone.


840
01:28:46.459 --> 01:28:49.518
Now, l'm not gonna change my story
just to have something to spit.


841
01:28:49.695 --> 01:28:52.391
-Why was your brother so agitated?
-Which?


842
01:28:53.364 --> 01:28:54.456
Bob.

843
01:28:55.833 --> 01:28:58.825
That's just his way. He's antsy.

844
01:28:59.603 --> 01:29:01.036
You know?

845
01:29:17.219 --> 01:29:19.813
You go on back to sleep now.

846
01:29:21.457 --> 01:29:24.585
You got me agitated now, you see?

847
01:29:30.998 --> 01:29:35.196
Yeah, just ain't no peace
when old Jesse's around.


848
01:29:35.736 --> 01:29:38.727
You ought to pity my poor wife.

849
01:29:41.407 --> 01:29:43.568
Ed Miller was a good friend of mine.

850
01:29:43.743 --> 01:29:47.179
He introduced me to you
at that one poker game.


851
01:29:47.914 --> 01:29:51.940
l'm a little angry with you, if you
wanna know the God's honest truth.


852
01:29:54.419 --> 01:29:56.910
You ought to pity me too.

853
01:30:42.561 --> 01:30:46.497
<i>As proof of his confederacy with
the James Gang, Bob told the authorities...</i>


854
01:30:46.665 --> 01:30:50.157
<i>...that Dick Liddil was sleeping over
at the rented farmhouse...</i>


855
01:30:50.336 --> 01:30:53.169
<i>...while his ruined leg mended.</i>

856
01:30:58.176 --> 01:31:02.010
<i>And then, created a map
of the Harbison property...</i>


857
01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:08.412
<i>...leaving out the creek where
Wood Hite's remains now moldered.</i>


858
01:31:09.185 --> 01:31:11.380
Right, you boys are cornered!

859
01:31:11.554 --> 01:31:16.082
Come on out peaceably
and nobody'll get shot up!


860
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:22.253
Don't shoot!

861
01:31:26.868 --> 01:31:28.859
Come on out and show yourself!

862
01:31:43.917 --> 01:31:45.441
Hello.

863
01:31:45.785 --> 01:31:47.411
We got him.

864
01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:49.845
Give me that Colt, son.

865
01:31:54.793 --> 01:31:57.353
-All right.
-Andrew James Liddil...


866
01:31:57.529 --> 01:32:00.520
...l have a warrant here
for your arrest....


867
01:32:00.698 --> 01:32:05.067
<i>Snowstorms would move over Missouri
that Sunday, February 1 9th...</i>


868
01:32:05.236 --> 01:32:08.228
<i>...shutting down commerce
for more than two days.</i>


869
01:32:09.873 --> 01:32:12.602
-Go, go, go.
-Are the papers here?


870
01:32:12.775 --> 01:32:16.404
-He wanted to know if the papers are here.
-l don't care what he wants.


871
01:32:16.579 --> 01:32:18.444
<i>Yet this wouldn't prevent Robert Ford...</i>

872
01:32:18.614 --> 01:32:21.014
<i>...from presenting himself
to Governor Crittenden...</i>


873
01:32:21.183 --> 01:32:24.277
<i>...at the Craig Rifles Ball on Wednesday.</i>

874
01:32:24.452 --> 01:32:28.013
l deem it a great privilege
on this glorious occasion...


875
01:32:28.189 --> 01:32:30.180
...to recognize publicly...

876
01:32:30.358 --> 01:32:33.020
...the intelligent and effective assistance...

877
01:32:33.194 --> 01:32:37.994
...that Captain Henry Craig has rendered
the state of Missouri and myself...


878
01:32:38.165 --> 01:32:41.623
...in our joint quest
to rid Jackson County...


879
01:32:42.034 --> 01:32:44.002
...of the James band.

880
01:32:44.170 --> 01:32:46.798
The task that Captain Craig
has assumed...


881
01:32:46.973 --> 01:32:51.102
...will require fearless courage,
extraordinary vigilance...


882
01:32:51.276 --> 01:32:54.211
...and an unerring selection
of instrumentalities.


883
01:32:55.380 --> 01:33:00.044
Well, l've gotten the signal from my wife
that enough is enough.


884
01:33:00.218 --> 01:33:02.584
However, before l sit...

885
01:33:02.753 --> 01:33:05.881
...l would like to ask you
to join me in a toast...


886
01:33:06.323 --> 01:33:10.020
...to a great son
of the state of Missouri...


887
01:33:10.194 --> 01:33:14.028
-...my friend, Henry Craig.
-Here, here.


888
01:33:26.708 --> 01:33:28.335
Yes.

889
01:33:29.310 --> 01:33:31.141
Just let my attorney know.

890
01:33:38.786 --> 01:33:42.050
Who is that? Who is it?

891
01:33:42.389 --> 01:33:43.947
Get out of the way now.

892
01:33:53.933 --> 01:33:58.028
You know, you're more goddamn trouble
than you're worth, Bob.


893
01:33:58.202 --> 01:33:59.897
l was just gonna say hello.

894
01:34:00.071 --> 01:34:03.302
No, you weren't gonna do that, Bob.
That's not why you're down here.


895
01:34:03.474 --> 01:34:08.740
You think it's your goddamn coming-out.
You think you're the belle of the ball.


896
01:34:08.912 --> 01:34:13.144
Now you get upstairs and try to keep your
identity secret, you silly little bastard.


897
01:34:13.317 --> 01:34:16.184
The governor'll see you in good time.
Take him up, boys.


898
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:24.017
<i>Bob would later be cross-examined
repeatedly...</i>


899
01:34:24.192 --> 01:34:28.390
<i>...about the exact nature of the deal
he had made with the authorities.</i>


900
01:34:28.563 --> 01:34:31.498
<i>And he was never consistent
in his recollections.</i>


901
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:39.901
My wife's asleep in the other room,
so let's speak as quietly as we can.


902
01:34:40.574 --> 01:34:42.804
So you're Dick Little.

903
01:34:44.678 --> 01:34:46.201
Liddil.

904
01:34:46.946 --> 01:34:48.880
l beg your pardon?

905
01:34:49.181 --> 01:34:50.773
l spell it with two D's.

906
01:34:50.949 --> 01:34:53.315
He's given us a full confession, governor.

907
01:34:53.485 --> 01:34:55.578
Newspapers haven't caught onto it yet.

908
01:34:55.754 --> 01:34:59.280
And you've guaranteed him
a conditional pardon...


909
01:34:59.457 --> 01:35:03.325
...and amnesty for all the robberies
he's committed.


910
01:35:04.962 --> 01:35:06.190
You Robert Ford?

911
01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:10.996
How old are you?

912
01:35:13.069 --> 01:35:14.502
Twenty.

913
01:35:14.804 --> 01:35:17.329
You surrender to Sheriff Timberlake
as well?


914
01:35:17.507 --> 01:35:21.409
No, no, governor. That's his brother,
Charley Ford, he's in the James Gang.


915
01:35:21.577 --> 01:35:24.306
But little Bob here,
we got nothing on Bob.


916
01:35:24.479 --> 01:35:27.039
He's just acting in capacity as a...

917
01:35:29.250 --> 01:35:31.411
...private detective.

918
01:35:32.587 --> 01:35:34.612
Jesse James sent me a telegram
last month...


919
01:35:34.789 --> 01:35:37.951
...saying he'd kill me
if he had to wreck a train to do it.


920
01:35:38.125 --> 01:35:40.753
He said once l got in his hands,
he'd cut my heart out...


921
01:35:40.927 --> 01:35:43.418
...and eat it in
strips like it was bacon.

922
01:35:43.597 --> 01:35:45.531
l'll wreck his train first.

923
01:35:53.104 --> 01:35:57.268
l'm sorry, Your Excellency.
l was thinking about something else.


924
01:35:57.442 --> 01:35:59.774
Jesse James is nothing more
than a public outlaw...


925
01:35:59.944 --> 01:36:02.741
...who made his reputation
by stealing whatever he wanted...


926
01:36:02.913 --> 01:36:05.143
...killing whoever got in his way.

927
01:36:05.315 --> 01:36:08.910
You'll hear some fools say he's getting back
at Republicans and Union men...


928
01:36:09.086 --> 01:36:11.850
...for the wrongs his family suffered
during the war.


929
01:36:12.022 --> 01:36:16.754
But his victims have scarcely been selected
with reference to their political views.


930
01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:19.956
l'm saying his sins
will soon find him out.

931
01:36:20.129 --> 01:36:22.791
l'm saying his cup of iniquity is full.

932
01:36:22.965 --> 01:36:25.661
l'm saying Jesse James
is a desperate case...


933
01:36:25.967 --> 01:36:28.867
...and may require a desperate remedy.

934
01:36:32.206 --> 01:36:35.300
Y'all got the right man for the job.

935
01:36:51.658 --> 01:36:53.921
Come on. Come on, now.

936
01:36:54.493 --> 01:36:56.120
Come on, now.

937
01:37:40.501 --> 01:37:43.061
Have you ever considered suicide?

938
01:37:45.104 --> 01:37:50.440
l can't say that l have. There's always
something else l wanted to do.


939
01:37:51.511 --> 01:37:57.380
Or my predicaments changed,
or l saw my hardships from a different slant.


940
01:37:57.549 --> 01:38:01.952
You know all what can happen.
lt never seemed respectable.


941
01:38:08.726 --> 01:38:11.558
l'll tell you one thing that's for certain.

942
01:38:11.728 --> 01:38:15.687
You won't mind dying
once you've peeked over the other side.


943
01:38:19.469 --> 01:38:22.495
You'll no more wanna go back
to your body than...


944
01:38:22.672 --> 01:38:25.139
...you'd wanna spoon up your own puke.

945
01:38:31.647 --> 01:38:34.445
Hey, since we're looking to rob banks...

946
01:38:34.615 --> 01:38:39.210
...l was wondering if we could
add another fella to the gang...


947
01:38:39.386 --> 01:38:43.015
...and sort of see if we couldn't
come out of our next job alive.


948
01:38:45.492 --> 01:38:50.485
Bob wanted to know could he ride with us
next time we took on a savings bank or--


949
01:38:56.802 --> 01:38:59.270
A savings bank or a--

950
01:39:01.006 --> 01:39:02.734
A railroad.

951
01:39:10.113 --> 01:39:13.412
Bob isn't much more than a boy
to most appearances.


952
01:39:13.584 --> 01:39:16.347
But there's about two tons
of sand in him.


953
01:39:16.519 --> 01:39:19.750
And he'll stand with a shooter
when that's what's called for.


954
01:39:19.922 --> 01:39:24.188
And he's smart too.
He's about as intricate as they come.


955
01:39:26.295 --> 01:39:29.024
You forget l already met the kid.

956
01:39:30.332 --> 01:39:33.062
Hell, he surely thinks highly of you.

957
01:39:33.602 --> 01:39:36.366
All of America thinks highly of me.

958
01:39:37.072 --> 01:39:40.302
Still, not like you got two million names
to snatch out of a sock...


959
01:39:40.473 --> 01:39:42.634
...whenever you need a third man.

960
01:39:46.145 --> 01:39:49.171
l can see you trying to
wear me down on this.


961
01:39:49.349 --> 01:39:51.544
That's my main intention.

962
01:40:00.626 --> 01:40:03.288
<i>Robberies would be conceived
but never carried out...</i>


963
01:40:03.462 --> 01:40:07.022
<i>...in Nebraska, 
Colorado and Missouri.</i>

964
01:40:07.665 --> 01:40:08.757
<i>During this time...</i>

965
01:40:08.933 --> 01:40:12.960
<i>...Henry Craig enjoined Robert Ford to return
to Elias' Grocery Store in Richmond...</i>


966
01:40:13.136 --> 01:40:16.196
<i>...and await instructions
from Sheriff James Timberlake.</i>


967
01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:18.903
All right, three cans...

968
01:40:19.074 --> 01:40:22.805
...peaches. Two cans....

969
01:40:24.079 --> 01:40:26.604
Two cans sifted peas.

970
01:40:26.915 --> 01:40:28.542
One bottle...

971
01:40:31.352 --> 01:40:34.549
...Mary's Morning Tonic, and a half--

972
01:40:37.625 --> 01:40:40.185
Half a sack of flour.

973
01:40:41.362 --> 01:40:43.421
l'll be right with you.

974
01:40:59.411 --> 01:41:01.743
l haven't seen any sign of him.

975
01:41:03.214 --> 01:41:05.580
Well, do you know where he's living?

976
01:41:06.685 --> 01:41:08.050
No.

977
01:41:09.219 --> 01:41:10.652
No?

978
01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:16.154
Well, l can't guess how he does it...

979
01:41:16.326 --> 01:41:20.626
...but he is always knowledgeable
about what's going on.


980
01:41:20.797 --> 01:41:25.096
He's gonna know l've been here with you.
You ought to take that for granted.


981
01:41:27.602 --> 01:41:31.561
And he will kill you
if he gets the chance.

982
01:41:34.809 --> 01:41:37.369
Are you willing to risk that?

983
01:41:41.982 --> 01:41:43.711
Yes, l am.

984
01:41:46.787 --> 01:41:48.515
l've been a nobody all my life.

985
01:41:49.455 --> 01:41:51.286
l was the baby.

986
01:41:51.557 --> 01:41:54.993
l was the one they made promises to
that they never kept.


987
01:41:56.195 --> 01:42:00.893
And ever since l can remember it,
Jesse James has been as big as a tree.


988
01:42:04.335 --> 01:42:06.599
l'm prepared for this, Jim...

989
01:42:07.505 --> 01:42:09.666
...and l'm gonna accomplish it.

990
01:42:09.907 --> 01:42:12.000
l know l won't get
but this one opportunity...


991
01:42:12.176 --> 01:42:15.076
...and you can bet your life
l'm not gonna spoil it.


992
01:42:27.088 --> 01:42:28.146
Well...

993
01:42:29.357 --> 01:42:31.348
...wait for your chance.

994
01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:35.261
Don't let yourself be found alone with him,
and do not...


995
01:42:36.131 --> 01:42:38.531
...let him get behind you.

996
01:43:06.657 --> 01:43:07.851
You been chosen.

997
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:14.422
Well, what do you mean?

998
01:43:15.699 --> 01:43:18.189
Well, your brother said that
you might wanna join us.


999
01:43:18.368 --> 01:43:21.701
But maybe you like this grocery store
more than you said you did.


1000
01:43:25.008 --> 01:43:27.067
-So you missed me?
-Oh, yeah.


1001
01:43:27.743 --> 01:43:30.404
l been crying myself to sleep every night.

1002
01:43:39.954 --> 01:43:41.945
Don't let him see
us so much as wink.

1003
01:43:42.123 --> 01:43:45.956
He's suspicious as a damn coyote,
and he don't trust you one iota.


1004
01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:48.457
-Well, l guess that makes--
-Hey.


1005
01:43:48.628 --> 01:43:53.088
He already put away Ed Miller. He said so
like it was something piddly he'd done.


1006
01:44:34.068 --> 01:44:38.300
lf we're ever alone for more than a minute,
l'd like a chance to talk to you further.


1007
01:45:18.041 --> 01:45:20.271
They gave me ten days.

1008
01:45:24.147 --> 01:45:25.670
For what?

1009
01:45:27.650 --> 01:45:29.515
For arresting him.

1010
01:45:35.590 --> 01:45:37.251
You and me, huh?

1011
01:45:40.894 --> 01:45:44.159
lt's gonna happen one way or another,
Charley. lt's gonna happen.


1012
01:45:44.331 --> 01:45:46.925
So it might as well be us
who get rich on it.


1013
01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:50.399
-Bob, he's our friend.
-He murdered Ed Miller.


1014
01:45:51.037 --> 01:45:54.131
And he's gonna murder Liddil and Cummins
if the chance ever comes.


1015
01:45:55.575 --> 01:46:00.205
lt seems to me Jesse's riding from
man to man, saying goodbye to the gang.


1016
01:46:01.714 --> 01:46:04.079
So your friendship could put you
under the pansies.


1017
01:46:06.151 --> 01:46:10.611
l'll grind it fine in my mind, Bob. l can't
go any further than that right now.


1018
01:46:14.191 --> 01:46:15.624
You'll come around.

1019
01:46:16.759 --> 01:46:19.227
You think it's all made up, don't you?

1020
01:46:19.395 --> 01:46:22.728
You think it's all yarns
and newspaper stories.


1021
01:46:30.606 --> 01:46:32.938
He's just a human being.

1022
01:46:41.182 --> 01:46:44.309
From now on, you two
won't go anywhere without me.


1023
01:46:45.085 --> 01:46:49.647
From now on, you'll ask for my permission!
From now on, you'll ask to be excused!


1024
01:47:45.572 --> 01:47:49.871
Charley, take them horses
around the barn. Bob, you go on inside.


1025
01:47:50.710 --> 01:47:52.041
-Hello, Mary.
-Hi.


1026
01:47:52.211 --> 01:47:55.374
Look at this rotten parsnip
l found in the compost heap.


1027
01:48:05.590 --> 01:48:07.490
You never mentioned Bob would be here.

1028
01:48:11.762 --> 01:48:14.754
Maybe he was saving it
as a pleasant surprise.


1029
01:48:19.369 --> 01:48:22.031
Got two cousins for company now.

1030
01:48:31.747 --> 01:48:34.045
How it's gonna be is...

1031
01:48:34.416 --> 01:48:38.613
...we'll leave next Monday afternoon
and ride down to Platte City.


1032
01:48:41.489 --> 01:48:43.423
How far is that from Kansas City?

1033
01:48:45.126 --> 01:48:47.959
Platte City's 30 miles south.

1034
01:48:49.596 --> 01:48:54.191
You and me and Charley'll
sleep in the woods overnight...


1035
01:48:54.700 --> 01:48:59.103
...and we'll strike the Wells Bank
sometime before the court recesses.


1036
01:49:03.908 --> 01:49:06.843
What time will that be exactly?

1037
01:49:12.484 --> 01:49:15.009
Well, you don't need to know that.

1038
01:49:30.031 --> 01:49:33.000
You know, l'm real comfortable
with your brother.


1039
01:49:33.235 --> 01:49:35.760
Hell, he's ugly as sin,
he smells like a skunk...


1040
01:49:36.571 --> 01:49:40.007
...and he's so ignorant
he couldn't drive nails in the snow...


1041
01:49:40.175 --> 01:49:42.665
...but he's sort of easy to be around.

1042
01:49:43.177 --> 01:49:45.975
l can't say the same for you, Bob.

1043
01:49:49.383 --> 01:49:51.749
Well, l'm sorry to hear you say that.

1044
01:49:53.621 --> 01:49:57.647
You know how it is when you're
with your girlfriend and the moon's out...


1045
01:49:57.823 --> 01:50:01.884
...and you know she wants to be kissed,
even though she never said so?


1046
01:50:05.297 --> 01:50:06.730
Yeah.

1047
01:50:09.467 --> 01:50:12.834
Well, you're giving me signs
that grieve my soul...


1048
01:50:13.704 --> 01:50:15.831
...and make me wonder...

1049
01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:18.606
...maybe your mind's
been changed about me.


1050
01:50:18.943 --> 01:50:22.400
Well, what do you want me to do?
Swear my good faith on the Bible?


1051
01:50:39.894 --> 01:50:41.828
You two having a spat?

1052
01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:49.591
l was getting ready to be angry.

1053
01:50:55.075 --> 01:50:57.407
Sit over here closer, kid.

1054
01:50:59.644 --> 01:51:00.906
Come on.

1055
01:51:12.056 --> 01:51:14.388
Charley, you'll stay with the animals.

1056
01:51:15.059 --> 01:51:16.959
Me and the kid...

1057
01:51:17.127 --> 01:51:21.086
...will walk into that bank
just before noon.


1058
01:51:22.967 --> 01:51:25.594
Bob will move that cashier...

1059
01:51:26.135 --> 01:51:29.366
...away from the shotgun
that's under the counter...


1060
01:51:29.539 --> 01:51:32.406
...and l'll creep up behind that cashier...

1061
01:51:32.574 --> 01:51:34.906
...and l'll cock his head back like so.

1062
01:51:35.177 --> 01:51:36.201
And l'll say:

1063
01:51:36.378 --> 01:51:39.107
''How come an off-scouring
like you is still sucking air...


1064
01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:41.544
...when so many of mine
are in coffins?'' l'll say:


1065
01:51:41.716 --> 01:51:45.049
''How did you get to reach 20
without leaking out all over your clothes?''


1066
01:51:45.519 --> 01:51:49.386
And if l don't like his attitude,
l will slit that phildoodle so deep...


1067
01:51:49.689 --> 01:51:52.715
...he will flop on
the floor like a fish.

1068
01:51:56.396 --> 01:51:58.762
My God, what just happened?

1069
01:52:08.006 --> 01:52:11.373
Boy, l could hear your gears grinding...

1070
01:52:11.676 --> 01:52:15.042
...hear your little motor wondering,
''My gosh, what's next?


1071
01:52:15.212 --> 01:52:16.577
What's happening to me?''

1072
01:52:18.448 --> 01:52:20.313
You were precious to behold, Bob.

1073
01:52:20.484 --> 01:52:23.112
You were white as
spit in a cotton field.

1074
01:52:23.654 --> 01:52:26.122
You got him. You got him.

1075
01:52:27.757 --> 01:52:31.818
You wanna know how that feels?
Unpleasant. l honestly can't recommend it.


1076
01:52:37.332 --> 01:52:39.800
The old Charley looked stricken!

1077
01:52:40.467 --> 01:52:42.298
l was. l was.

1078
01:52:42.469 --> 01:52:47.463
''This is plumb unexpected,'' old Charley
was thinking. ''That done ruined my day.''


1079
01:52:55.248 --> 01:52:56.681
Hell. Hell.

1080
01:53:27.644 --> 01:53:31.512
<i>Jesse slept with Bob
in the children's room that night.</i>


1081
01:53:32.815 --> 01:53:35.409
<i>And Bob remained awake.</i>

1082
01:53:38.253 --> 01:53:41.620
<i>He could see that there was a gun
on the nightstand.</i>


1083
01:53:42.490 --> 01:53:46.482
<i>He could imagine its cold nickel
inside his grip...</i>


1084
01:53:47.394 --> 01:53:50.886
<i>...its two-pound weight
reached out and aimed.</i>


1085
01:54:22.026 --> 01:54:24.118
l need to go to the privy.

1086
01:54:25.328 --> 01:54:28.729
You think you do, but you don't.

1087
01:54:51.951 --> 01:54:54.112
You wait for grace, now.

1088
01:54:55.055 --> 01:54:58.388
-Thank you, Mama.
-Thank you, Zee. God, that looks good.


1089
01:54:58.558 --> 01:55:00.185
-Thank you, Zee.
-You're welcome.


1090
01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:03.453
Well, is this fit to
eat or will it just do?

1091
01:55:06.365 --> 01:55:08.458
Woman's cooking's
always been a scandal.


1092
01:55:08.634 --> 01:55:11.000
Cut her meat and the whole table moves.

1093
01:55:11.937 --> 01:55:13.996
You want a biscuit?
You gonna have a biscuit?


1094
01:55:14.172 --> 01:55:17.972
Here's some butter.
Come on. Come on.


1095
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:21.207
Oh, shoot.

1096
01:55:21.378 --> 01:55:25.178
<i>And so it went,
Jesse was increasingly cavalier...</i>


1097
01:55:25.348 --> 01:55:29.078
<i>...merry, moody, fey...</i>

1098
01:55:29.251 --> 01:55:31.344
<i>...unpredictable.</i>

1099
01:55:32.888 --> 01:55:36.016
<i>He camouflaged his depressions
and derangements...</i>


1100
01:55:36.192 --> 01:55:40.184
<i>...with masquerades
of extreme cordiality, courtesy...</i>


1101
01:55:40.361 --> 01:55:43.125
<i>...and goodwill towards others.</i>

1102
01:55:44.199 --> 01:55:48.465
<i>But even as he jested,
or tickled his boy in the ribs...</i>


1103
01:55:48.636 --> 01:55:52.265
<i>...Jesse would look over at Bob
with melancholy eyes...</i>


1104
01:55:52.439 --> 01:55:56.397
<i>...as if the two were meshed
in an intimate communication.</i>


1105
01:55:59.212 --> 01:56:01.840
<i>Bob was certain that the man
had unriddled him...</i>


1106
01:56:02.014 --> 01:56:04.676
<i>...had seen through his reasons
for coming along...</i>


1107
01:56:04.851 --> 01:56:08.843
<i>...that Jesse could forecast each of
Bob's possible moves and inclinations...</i>


1108
01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:10.851
<i>...and was only acting the innocent...</i>

1109
01:56:11.022 --> 01:56:15.959
<i>...in order to lull Bob
into stupid tranquility and miscalculation.</i>


1110
01:56:37.646 --> 01:56:39.841
How long you been studying me?

1111
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:44.479
You're gonna break a lot of hearts.

1112
01:56:52.393 --> 01:56:53.587
How do you mean?

1113
01:57:02.835 --> 01:57:04.564
lt's a present.

1114
01:57:09.241 --> 01:57:10.798
lt's heavy.

1115
01:57:11.376 --> 01:57:13.503
Well, you gonna look inside?

1116
01:57:15.079 --> 01:57:16.876
lt's April Fools' 
Day, you know.

1117
01:57:17.448 --> 01:57:19.279
lt ain't no joke.

1118
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:28.348
Oh, such extravagance.

1119
01:57:29.892 --> 01:57:32.588
Don't that nickel just shine, though?

1120
01:57:32.795 --> 01:57:34.353
lt's more than l could hope for.

1121
01:57:34.530 --> 01:57:37.327
l figured that granddaddy Colt
may blow into fragments...


1122
01:57:37.499 --> 01:57:40.263
...next time you try
to squeeze the trigger.


1123
01:57:40.502 --> 01:57:42.902
Well, you might have something there.

1124
01:57:43.405 --> 01:57:46.033
Tom, supper's ready.

1125
01:57:47.209 --> 01:57:49.233
l'll be right there, sweetheart.

1126
01:57:49.410 --> 01:57:51.708
l might be too excited to eat.

1127
01:57:54.982 --> 01:57:57.473
You know what John Newman Edwards
once wrote about me?


1128
01:57:58.519 --> 01:58:01.351
He said l didn't trust
two men in 1 0,000...


1129
01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:04.182
...and even them l was cautious around.

1130
01:58:04.990 --> 01:58:06.981
Government's sort of run me ragged.

1131
01:58:08.961 --> 01:58:11.953
l'm going the long way around the barn
to say that...


1132
01:58:12.130 --> 01:58:15.758
...l been feeling cornered
and just plain ornery as of late...


1133
01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:21.164
...and l'd be pleased if you'd accept
that gun as my way of apologizing.


1134
01:58:23.541 --> 01:58:26.338
Heaven knows l'd be ornerier
if l were in your position.


1135
01:58:26.509 --> 01:58:29.603
No. No, l haven't been acting correctly.

1136
01:58:31.414 --> 01:58:34.941
Seems l hardly recognize myself
when l'm greased.


1137
01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:40.510
l go on journeys out of my body...

1138
01:58:40.688 --> 01:58:44.784
...and look at my red hands
and my mean face...


1139
01:58:45.560 --> 01:58:49.291
...and l wonder about that man
that's gone so wrong.


1140
01:58:53.066 --> 01:58:56.092
l've been becoming a problem to myself.

1141
01:59:08.747 --> 01:59:10.112
Well....

1142
01:59:16.755 --> 01:59:21.384
-l better wash my hands if supper's on.
-Yeah, go ahead.


1143
01:59:34.737 --> 01:59:37.672
<i>The day before he died was Palm Sunday.</i>

1144
01:59:38.707 --> 01:59:42.006
<i>And Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Howard,
their two children...</i>


1145
01:59:42.177 --> 01:59:44.235
<i>...and their cousin Charles Johnson...</i>

1146
01:59:44.412 --> 01:59:49.577
<i>...strolled to the Second Presbyterian
Church to attend the 1 0:00 service.</i>


1147
01:59:51.986 --> 01:59:54.284
<i>Bob remained at the cottage...</i>

1148
01:59:54.455 --> 01:59:57.855
<i>...and slyly migrated from room to room.</i>

1149
02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:02.291
<i>He walked into the master bedroom...</i>

1150
02:00:02.462 --> 02:00:06.228
<i>...and inventoried the clothes
on the hangers and hooks.</i>


1151
02:00:12.537 --> 02:00:15.870
<i>He sipped from the water glass
on the vanity.</i>


1152
02:00:18.209 --> 02:00:22.474
<i>He smelled the talcum and lilacs
on Jesse's pillowcase.</i>


1153
02:00:30.387 --> 02:00:32.582
<i>His fingers skittered over his ribs...</i>

1154
02:00:32.756 --> 02:00:36.623
<i>...to construe the scars
where Jesse was twice shot.</i>


1155
02:00:40.429 --> 02:00:45.025
<i>He manufactured a middle finger
that was missing the top two knuckles.</i>


1156
02:00:52.473 --> 02:00:55.408
<i>He imagined himself at 34.</i>

1157
02:00:57.411 --> 02:01:00.402
<i>He imagined himself in a coffin.</i>

1158
02:01:02.482 --> 02:01:04.211
<i>He considered possibilities...</i>

1159
02:01:04.384 --> 02:01:07.683
<i>...and everything wonderful
that could come true.</i>


1160
02:01:35.478 --> 02:01:37.412
He's not gonna kill us.

1161
02:01:42.651 --> 02:01:44.812
Yeah, he is.

1162
02:01:47.121 --> 02:01:49.612
Well, l'll stay awake so he can't.

1163
02:02:02.969 --> 02:02:05.402
You're imagining things.

1164
02:02:17.649 --> 02:02:19.617
Ain't gonna be no Platte City.

1165
02:02:21.351 --> 02:02:23.979
That's Jesse fooling with us.

1166
02:02:40.403 --> 02:02:42.632
Go to sleep, Charley.

1167
02:03:16.235 --> 02:03:17.827
Morning.

1168
02:03:21.639 --> 02:03:23.163
Charley.

1169
02:03:53.001 --> 02:03:55.435
Bob, how much did you want to eat?

1170
02:03:59.939 --> 02:04:02.373
l'm feeling sort of peculiar.

1171
02:04:21.593 --> 02:04:24.061
Why is it you're looking so interested?

1172
02:04:25.529 --> 02:04:28.430
You think it's intelligent
to go out like that...


1173
02:04:28.598 --> 02:04:30.429
...so all creation can see your guns?

1174
02:04:48.183 --> 02:04:49.616
Hi.

1175
02:04:59.927 --> 02:05:02.828
Come on, let's go see
what your mama's doing.


1176
02:05:03.963 --> 02:05:06.090
Timmy, get that door, would you?

1177
02:05:10.235 --> 02:05:13.398
-Well, you lost your shoe, sweetheart.
-Yeah, l did.


1178
02:05:13.572 --> 02:05:17.701
That's gonna be a problem.
They don't sell those one at a time.


1179
02:05:19.210 --> 02:05:21.269
We lost a shoe, Mama.

1180
02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:25.440
Will you put that up for Daddy,
would you?


1181
02:05:28.518 --> 02:05:31.282
-What you doing, you lose a shoe?
-Yeah.


1182
02:05:48.003 --> 02:05:51.404
lt's only meant to go on top,
to complement.


1183
02:05:51.673 --> 02:05:53.504
Yeah, l know. Sometimes, l--

1184
02:06:18.096 --> 02:06:20.996
Bob, everything's getting cold!

1185
02:06:21.699 --> 02:06:25.100
-Where's Mary?
-She's outside, darling.


1186
02:06:26.103 --> 02:06:27.900
Mary?

1187
02:06:31.676 --> 02:06:34.200
What do you think goes on
in that noggin of his?


1188
02:06:37.213 --> 02:06:38.908
Nothing.

1189
02:06:39.481 --> 02:06:42.279
l was talking about his mind, not yours.

1190
02:06:43.218 --> 02:06:44.947
Oh, yeah.

1191
02:06:45.386 --> 02:06:47.081
Oh, l get it.

1192
02:07:42.504 --> 02:07:44.472
Well, hello now.

1193
02:07:44.873 --> 02:07:47.899
''The arrest and confession
of Dick Liddil.''


1194
02:07:53.147 --> 02:07:55.308
You don't say so.

1195
02:08:09.629 --> 02:08:11.722
That's very strange.

1196
02:08:12.165 --> 02:08:15.065
Says here Dick surrendered
three weeks ago.


1197
02:08:15.233 --> 02:08:17.827
You must have been
right in the neighborhood.


1198
02:08:18.503 --> 02:08:21.131
Well, apparently, they kept it a secret.

1199
02:08:32.349 --> 02:08:35.409
lf l get to Kansas City soon,
l'll ask somebody about it.


1200
02:09:16.088 --> 02:09:17.783
You two ready?

1201
02:09:21.492 --> 02:09:24.154
l will be, by noon.

1202
02:09:57.058 --> 02:09:59.719
<i>There is a ship
She sails the sea</i>


1203
02:09:59.893 --> 02:10:02.657
<i>She's loaded deep
As deep can be</i>


1204
02:10:02.829 --> 02:10:05.059
<i>But not as deep
As the love I'm in</i>


1205
02:10:05.632 --> 02:10:09.261
<i>I know not if I sink or swim</i>

1206
02:10:10.302 --> 02:10:11.997
<i>The water is wide</i>

1207
02:10:13.138 --> 02:10:19.702
<i>I can't cross o'er
And neither have I wings to fly</i>


1208
02:10:20.145 --> 02:10:23.944
<i>Give me a boat
That can carry two</i>


1209
02:10:24.115 --> 02:10:26.982
<i>Both shall row
My love and I</i>


1210
02:10:27.150 --> 02:10:30.608
<i>For love is gentle
And love is kind</i>


1211
02:10:30.787 --> 02:10:33.779
<i>Sweetest flower
When first it's new</i>


1212
02:10:33.957 --> 02:10:37.551
<i>But love grows old
And waxes cold</i>


1213
02:10:37.727 --> 02:10:40.958
<i>And fades away
Like the morning dew</i>


1214
02:10:41.130 --> 02:10:44.156
<i>There is a ship
She sails the sea</i>


1215
02:10:44.333 --> 02:10:47.097
l guess l'll take my guns off...

1216
02:10:47.436 --> 02:10:49.426
...for fear the neighbors might spy them.

1217
02:11:22.734 --> 02:11:25.168
Don't that picture look dusty?

1218
02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:10.251
What have--? What have you done?

1219
02:13:12.698 --> 02:13:14.325
Jesse.

1220
02:13:19.872 --> 02:13:20.896
Jesse?

1221
02:13:22.041 --> 02:13:24.167
Jesse? Jesse?

1222
02:13:24.909 --> 02:13:26.774
Jesse!

1223
02:13:27.779 --> 02:13:29.872
No!

1224
02:13:34.052 --> 02:13:36.383
No. Jess--

1225
02:13:36.987 --> 02:13:41.390
Come back. Oh, come back.

1226
02:13:43.526 --> 02:13:47.690
Oh, Jesse! No!

1227
02:13:48.196 --> 02:13:52.098
Oh, Bob. Have you done this?!

1228
02:13:52.300 --> 02:13:54.666
l swear to God l didn't.

1229
02:13:55.670 --> 02:13:57.103
lt was an accident, Zee.

1230
02:13:59.307 --> 02:14:02.673
Come on. Pistol went off accidentally.

1231
02:14:48.016 --> 02:14:49.210
Put my name.

1232
02:14:49.384 --> 02:14:51.851
Why, what'd you do? l shot him.

1233
02:14:59.060 --> 02:15:01.085
You might wanna keep that.

1234
02:15:39.029 --> 02:15:41.122
Thank you all very much.

1235
02:15:49.271 --> 02:15:51.762
<i>The resulting prints
sold for 2 dollars apiece...</i>


1236
02:15:51.940 --> 02:15:56.535
<i>...and were the models for the lithographed
covers on a number of magazines.</i>


1237
02:16:02.082 --> 02:16:07.281
<i>Soon a thousand strangers were making
spellbound pilgrimages to the cottage...</i>

<i>...for the body

Hello, here!

1250
02:17:24.257 --> 02:17:26.850
''The arrest and confession
of Dick Liddil.''


1251
02:17:27.024 --> 02:17:32.155
Young man, l thought you told me
you didn't know Dick had surrendered.


1252
02:17:32.329 --> 02:17:36.197
You mean he did? l didn't know.

1253
02:17:37.101 --> 02:17:39.000
But l knew l had not fooled him.

1254
02:17:39.168 --> 02:17:43.002
And he knew, as well as l, in that moment
that l intended to bring him to justice.


1255
02:17:43.940 --> 02:17:47.501
But he would not kill me
in the presence of his wife and children.


1256
02:17:47.677 --> 02:17:50.908
And so he was smiling
to throw me off-guard.


1257
02:17:54.149 --> 02:17:56.811
Well, it's all right, anyway, Bob.

1258
02:17:58.686 --> 02:18:01.587
<i>It was widely felt that
Bob possessed some acting talent...</i>


1259
02:18:01.756 --> 02:18:04.019
<i>...and Charley, not a jot.</i>

1260
02:18:04.190 --> 02:18:07.125
That picture's awful dusty.

1261
02:18:07.927 --> 02:18:11.055
<i>Charley was only expected
not to slouch or mutter...</i>


1262
02:18:11.231 --> 02:18:15.895
<i>...and to transport his sicknesses
to the alley before letting them go.</i>


1263
02:18:45.294 --> 02:18:47.159
And that's...

1264
02:18:47.730 --> 02:18:50.392
...how l killed Jesse James.

1265
02:18:53.869 --> 02:18:57.395
<i>By October of 1 883, Bob Ford
could be identified correctly...</i>


1266
02:18:57.572 --> 02:19:01.838
<i>...by more citizens than could
the president of the United States.</i>


1267
02:19:02.509 --> 02:19:07.242
<i>He was as renowned at 20 as Jesse was
after 1 4 years of grand larceny.</i>


1268
02:19:07.414 --> 02:19:09.608
You won't get your hooks into me.

1269
02:19:10.149 --> 02:19:14.882
That's right. That's right.
Sit next to your boyfriend. Jezebel.


1270
02:19:15.054 --> 02:19:17.147
<i>Charley was increasingly superstitious...</i>

1271
02:19:17.323 --> 02:19:20.019
<i>...increasingly subject
to the advice of soothsayers...</i>


1272
02:19:20.193 --> 02:19:24.219
<i>...who promised to cure his miseries
with pipe smoke and poultices.</i>


1273
02:19:24.396 --> 02:19:27.661
You been spending too much time
with Gypsies, Charley.


1274
02:19:33.372 --> 02:19:34.736
Shit.

1275
02:19:39.075 --> 02:19:41.635
The picture's awful dusty.

1276
02:19:42.078 --> 02:19:45.912
<i>Something began to change
in Charley's stage portrayal of Jesse.</i>


1277
02:19:46.082 --> 02:19:48.606
<i>His gait seemed more practiced.</i>

1278
02:19:48.784 --> 02:19:52.083
<i>His voice was spookily similar
to the man's.</i>


1279
02:19:52.254 --> 02:19:54.654
<i>His newly suggested dialogue
was analogous...</i>


1280
02:19:54.823 --> 02:19:57.849
<i>...to a script Jesse might have originated.</i>

1281
02:20:00.661 --> 02:20:03.095
<i>He began to look at his younger brother
with spite...</i>


1282
02:20:03.264 --> 02:20:05.892
<i>...as if he suspected that
in some future performance...</i>


1283
02:20:06.067 --> 02:20:10.595
<i>...he might present himself
to a live cartridge in Robert Ford's gun.</i>


1284
02:20:11.937 --> 02:20:13.768
Murderer!

1285
02:20:14.106 --> 02:20:15.835
Cur!

1286
02:20:16.475 --> 02:20:18.238
Coward!

1287
02:20:21.781 --> 02:20:26.308
You wanna investigate my courage?
Do you?


1288
02:20:26.718 --> 02:20:30.484
Find out! Find out!

1289
02:20:35.126 --> 02:20:36.991
Nobody.

1290
02:20:51.573 --> 02:20:53.370
Coward!

1291
02:21:18.564 --> 02:21:24.127
<i>By his own approximation, Bob
assassinated Jesse James over 800 times.</i>


1292
02:21:24.303 --> 02:21:28.069
<i>He suspected no one in history
had ever so often or so publicly...</i>


1293
02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:31.436
<i>...recapitulated an act of betrayal.</i>

1294
02:21:36.647 --> 02:21:39.411
<i>Bob always challenged
the allegations of cowardice...</i>


1295
02:21:39.584 --> 02:21:42.518
<i>...but Charley seemed
to agree with them.</i>


1296
02:21:42.786 --> 02:21:46.552
<i>He spoke of Mrs. Zee James
as certain priests might the Madonna...</i>


1297
02:21:46.722 --> 02:21:49.816
<i>...and composed long soul-describing letters
to her...</i>


1298
02:21:49.992 --> 02:21:52.187
<i>...begging her forgiveness...</i>

1299
02:21:53.496 --> 02:21:56.089
<i>...none of which he mailed.</i>

1300
02:22:23.955 --> 02:22:29.552
<i>Charley Ford became all that his countrymen
wanted an assassin of Jesse James to be.</i>


1301
02:22:33.831 --> 02:22:39.701
<i>Jesse James was a man
Who killed many men</i>


1302
02:22:40.905 --> 02:22:45.342
<i>He robbed the Glendale train</i>

1303
02:22:45.575 --> 02:22:51.411
<i>And he stole from the rich
And he gave to the poor</i>


1304
02:22:51.647 --> 02:22:56.584
<i>He had a hand
And a heart and a brain</i>


1305
02:22:57.386 --> 02:23:02.880
<i>Well, Jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life</i>


1306
02:23:03.057 --> 02:23:08.154
<i>Three children
They were brave</i>


1307
02:23:08.329 --> 02:23:13.925
<i>But that dirty little coward
Who shot Mr. Howard</i>


1308
02:23:14.167 --> 02:23:19.230
<i>Has laid Jesse James in his grave</i>

1309
02:23:20.307 --> 02:23:25.300
<i>It was Robert Ford
That dirty little coward</i>


1310
02:23:26.044 --> 02:23:30.447
<i>I wonder how does he feel</i>

1311
02:23:30.615 --> 02:23:36.349
<i>For he ate at Jesse's bread
And he slept in Jesse's bed</i>


1312
02:23:36.521 --> 02:23:41.548
<i>And he laid poor Jesse in his grave</i>

1313
02:23:42.025 --> 02:23:47.554
<i>Well, Jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life</i>

02:24:27.065 --> 02:24:30.795
lt was two children, not three.

1319
02:24:42.178 --> 02:24:43.509
Hey.

1320
02:24:44.414 --> 02:24:46.974
You get yourself home, son, okay?

1321
02:24:47.684 --> 02:24:51.711
Come on. Get out of here.
Get out of my place.


1322
02:25:23.482 --> 02:25:25.677
<i>He thought, at his angriest...</i>

1323
02:25:25.851 --> 02:25:29.617
<i>...about visiting the kin
of Jesse's slaughtered victims:</i>


1324
02:25:31.589 --> 02:25:34.853
<i>Mrs. William Westfall in Plattsburg...</i>

1325
02:25:37.361 --> 02:25:40.455
<i>...the Wymore family in Clay County...</i>

1326
02:25:45.601 --> 02:25:49.901
<i>...perhaps even Mrs. Joseph Heywood
in Northfield, Minnesota.</i>


1327
02:25:52.975 --> 02:25:55.967
<i>He would go to their homes
and give his name as Robert Ford...</i>


1328
02:25:56.145 --> 02:25:59.113
<i>...the man who killed Jesse James.</i>

1329
02:26:00.549 --> 02:26:03.609
<i>He imagined they would
be grateful to him.</i>


1330
02:26:54.563 --> 02:26:59.557
<i>It was only with Dorothy Evans
that Bob spoke revealingly or plainly...</i>


1331
02:26:59.735 --> 02:27:04.171
<i>...and it was with her that he spoke of
things he didn't know he knew.</i>


1332
02:27:25.825 --> 02:27:29.885
<i>He told her that he had no real memory
of the shooting and its aftermath.</i>


1333
02:27:30.061 --> 02:27:33.929
<i>He could remember lifting the gun
that Jesse had given him...</i>


1334
02:27:34.666 --> 02:27:38.693
<i>...and then it was Good Friday and he was
reading about the funeral proceedings...</i>


1335
02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:41.394
<i>...as if they'd happened a long time ago.</i>

1336
02:27:42.972 --> 02:27:45.099
Why did you kill him?

1337
02:27:49.412 --> 02:27:51.437
Well, he was gonna kill me.

1338
02:27:56.652 --> 02:27:59.883
So you were scared
and that's the only reason?


1339
02:28:02.624 --> 02:28:04.023
Yeah.

1340
02:28:04.493 --> 02:28:06.551
And the reward money.

1341
02:28:12.365 --> 02:28:15.163
Do you want me to change the subject?

1342
02:28:23.375 --> 02:28:25.707
You know what l expected?

1343
02:28:26.745 --> 02:28:28.736
Applause.

1344
02:28:31.316 --> 02:28:35.480
l was only 20 years old then.
l couldn't see how it would look to people.


1345
02:28:39.591 --> 02:28:42.253
l was surprised by what happened.

1346
02:28:43.328 --> 02:28:45.295
They didn't applaud.

1347
02:28:48.731 --> 02:28:50.596
<i>He was ashamed of his boasting...</i>

1348
02:28:50.766 --> 02:28:53.633
<i>...his pretensions of courage
and ruthlessness.</i>


1349
02:28:53.936 --> 02:28:57.701
<i>He was sorry about his cold-bloodedness,
his dispassion...</i>


1350
02:28:59.341 --> 02:29:03.744
<i>...his inability to express
what he now believed was the case:</i>


1351
02:29:06.314 --> 02:29:09.340
<i>That he truly regretted killing Jesse...</i>

1352
02:29:10.117 --> 02:29:13.109
<i>...that he missed the man
as much as anybody...</i>


1353
02:29:13.654 --> 02:29:16.782
<i>...and wished his murder
hadn't been necessary.</i>


1354
02:29:36.240 --> 02:29:38.333
<i>Even as he circulated his saloon...</i>

1355
02:29:38.509 --> 02:29:42.275
<i>...he knew that the smiles disappeared
when he passed by.</i>


1356
02:29:43.381 --> 02:29:45.212
<i>He received so many menacing letters...</i>

1357
02:29:45.383 --> 02:29:48.818
<i>...that he could read them
without any reaction except curiosity.</i>


1358
02:29:52.621 --> 02:29:57.422
<i>He kept to his apartment all day,
flipping over playing cards...</i>


1359
02:29:58.928 --> 02:30:03.421
<i>...looking at his destiny
in every king and jack.</i>


1360
02:30:07.635 --> 02:30:11.935
<i>Edward O'Kelly came up from Bachelor
at 1 p.m. on the 8th.</i>


1361
02:30:13.408 --> 02:30:17.343
<i>He had no grand scheme, no strategy...</i>

1362
02:30:17.511 --> 02:30:19.911
<i>...no agreement with higher authorities...</i>

1363
02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:22.844
<i>...nothing beyond
a vague longing for glory...</i>


1364
02:30:23.916 --> 02:30:28.181
<i>...and a generalized wish
for revenge against Robert Ford.</i>


1365
02:30:35.961 --> 02:30:39.225
-How'd it go last night?
-Not so bad.


1366
02:30:42.466 --> 02:30:43.865
The other one.

1367
02:30:46.370 --> 02:30:49.134
<i>Edward O'Kelly would be ordered
to serve a life sentence...</i>


1368
02:30:49.306 --> 02:30:52.206
<i>...in the Colorado Penitentiary
for second-degree murder.</i>


1369
02:30:52.375 --> 02:30:55.139
<i>Over 7 000 signatures
would eventually be gathered...</i>


1370
02:30:55.310 --> 02:30:57.574
<i>...on a petition asking for
O'Kelly's release...</i>


1371
02:30:57.746 --> 02:31:02.740
<i>...and in 1 902, Governor James B. Orman
would pardon the man.</i>


1372
02:31:03.352 --> 02:31:07.754
You shouldn't be wearing that stickpin
again there, Bob. Opals are unlucky.


1373
02:31:09.190 --> 02:31:13.388
My luck's not very good as it is. l don't
think an opal's gonna change that much.


1374
02:31:14.328 --> 02:31:15.761
l hear you.

1375
02:31:29.341 --> 02:31:31.205
<i>There would be no eulogies for Bob...</i>

1376
02:31:32.910 --> 02:31:37.006
<i>...no photographs of his body
would be sold in sundries stores...</i>


1377
02:31:37.715 --> 02:31:42.084
<i>...no people would crowd the streets
in the rain to see his funeral cortege...</i>


1378
02:31:43.820 --> 02:31:46.789
<i>...no biographies would be written
about him...</i>


1379
02:31:46.957 --> 02:31:49.517
<i>...no children named after him.</i>

1380
02:31:51.094 --> 02:31:55.827
<i>No one would ever pay 25 cents
to stand in the rooms he grew up in.</i>


1381
02:32:00.368 --> 02:32:02.097
Hello, Bob.

1382
02:32:03.538 --> 02:32:07.736
<i>The shotgun would ignite,
and Ella Mae would scream...</i>


1383
02:32:08.543 --> 02:32:12.205
<i>...but Robert Ford would only lay
on the floor and look at the ceiling...</i>


1384
02:32:12.379 --> 02:32:14.870
<i>...the light going out of his eyes...</i>

1385
02:32:15.049 --> 02:32:17.779
<i>...before he could find the right words.</i>
