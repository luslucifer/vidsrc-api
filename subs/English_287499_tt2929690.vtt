00:03:22.406 --> 00:03:23.976
Papa, I want money.

2
00:03:24.908 --> 00:03:25.886
For what?

3
00:03:25.943 --> 00:03:28.651
As compensation for listening
to such a bad song!


4
00:03:34.918 --> 00:03:36.864
Nlonu, I'll give you a lot of money...

5
00:03:37.154 --> 00:03:38.531
Just listen to this next song!

6
00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.400
Papa, Please stop!

7
00:03:40.891 --> 00:03:42.564
I don't want your money.

8
00:03:48.865 --> 00:03:50.367
Bye, Papa.

9
00:04:58.802 --> 00:05:01.043
<i>ls</i> that girl in your class?

10
00:05:04.107 --> 00:05:04.744
Why?

11
00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:07.478
Don't be jealous.
I'll only marry you.


12
00:05:08.412 --> 00:05:10.790
Shut up Dhruv!

13
00:05:11.548 --> 00:05:15.621
You're saying shut up
because your eyeline is wrong.


14
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.034
Not bad!

15
00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:32.204
You pervert!

16
00:05:51.855 --> 00:05:52.731
Careful!

17
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:54.732
Come on lift!

18
00:05:54.891 --> 00:05:55.995
Just a little bit further.

19
00:05:57.394 --> 00:05:58.896
Do you guys do any work?

20
00:06:02.265 --> 00:06:04.074
Bloody elevator is also not working!

21
00:06:04.568 --> 00:06:06.343
Demand a Right to Information enquiry!

22
00:06:06.737 --> 00:06:08.648
The Principal is corrupt.

23
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.775
Come on.

24
00:06:13.443 --> 00:06:15.252
Don't keep putting it down.

25
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.227
Come on.
Let's get this over with.


26
00:08:09.593 --> 00:08:11.573
So tell...what else happened
in college today?


27
00:08:11.628 --> 00:08:13.835
She hung out with her boyfriend.
What else!


28
00:08:13.897 --> 00:08:15.638
<i>Shut up Menu!</i>

29
00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:18.607
Chill Sis!
Don't be shy in front of Mom!


30
00:08:19.903 --> 00:08:22.645
Monu. Dhruv is not her boyfriend!

31
00:08:22.706 --> 00:08:24.652
Can't one make a joke around here!

32
00:08:24.708 --> 00:08:26.483
What's the problem with you two'?

33
00:08:29.045 --> 00:08:31.855
If you don't finish your homework -
the IV is not coming on.


34
00:10:08.545 --> 00:10:09.819
Welcome. Welcome.

35
00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:10.914
What would you like?

36
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:11.789
Lingerie?

37
00:10:11.848 --> 00:10:15.125
I also have tongs (thongs).
Black laces, red laces...


38
00:10:15.218 --> 00:10:18.062
Purple, green, fluorescent colors...

39
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:23.571
Don't worry.
You can get anything here.


40
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.537
From a needle to an aeroplane!

41
00:10:25.629 --> 00:10:27.609
I can arrange anything.

42
00:10:27.664 --> 00:10:30.304
Uncle. We don't want an aeroplane...!
- What do you want?


43
00:10:31.267 --> 00:10:33.440
Do you have a vibrator?

44
00:10:35.372 --> 00:10:37.750
Of course!

45
00:10:37.807 --> 00:10:40.515
What model do you want?
Soft, hard, medium?


46
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.817
A phone without a
vibration unit is useless!


47
00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:45.792
I've put my own wife on a vibrator!

48
00:10:45.849 --> 00:10:48.557
She never hears the phone ring!

49
00:10:48.651 --> 00:10:51.791
Show her a vibration unit.
What's the model number of your phone?


50
00:11:23.286 --> 00:11:24.731
Where are you taking me?

51
00:11:38.868 --> 00:11:40.814
Since when did you
become a Bio student?


52
00:11:47.677 --> 00:11:48.678
<i>What?</i>

53
00:12:49.405 --> 00:12:51.248
Oh my god!

54
00:12:53.009 --> 00:12:55.080
Go...Yeah!

55
00:13:23.106 --> 00:13:26.053
Even at this age getting cake
smeared on my birthday!


56
00:13:28.378 --> 00:13:30.324
We should jam.

57
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.688
Yes definitely.

58
00:13:31.781 --> 00:13:32.555
Tell me when?

59
00:13:32.615 --> 00:13:36.222
You can come to my house...

60
00:13:36.619 --> 00:13:38.292
Anytime.

61
00:13:39.055 --> 00:13:40.090
<i>What?</i>

62
00:13:41.724 --> 00:13:42.998
Nothing.

63
00:13:46.029 --> 00:13:47.667
Come to your house...

64
00:13:48.364 --> 00:13:49.707
...to jam?

65
00:13:51.201 --> 00:13:52.475
Definitely.

66
00:13:53.203 --> 00:13:54.113
When?

67
00:13:54.938 --> 00:13:56.611
Anytime!

68
00:13:57.574 --> 00:13:58.814
Hey Nima!

69
00:13:59.542 --> 00:14:00.748
Come out dude.

70
00:14:12.255 --> 00:14:15.828
One, two, three, four...go!

71
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.838
Just a minute.
Somethings not right.


72
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.902
Aunty. The poha‘s yummy.

73
00:14:27.403 --> 00:14:30.247
Sameera, have you been playing guitar
since you were a child?


74
00:14:32.108 --> 00:14:34.213
No Aunty.
Just the last couple of years.


75
00:14:35.678 --> 00:14:38.181
Laila has been learning music
since she was seven.


76
00:14:39.582 --> 00:14:43.223
Sameera, has Laila played you any
of her classical compositions?


77
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.128
<i>MW“!</i>

78
00:14:45.521 --> 00:14:46.727
Practice!

79
00:14:49.559 --> 00:14:51.129
Call me if you want anything.

80
00:14:52.929 --> 00:14:54.272
I'm sorry.

81
00:14:54.464 --> 00:14:56.034
Chill. All moms are like this.

82
00:14:56.532 --> 00:14:57.875
Mom!!

83
00:14:58.067 --> 00:14:59.239
Napkins!

84
00:15:06.743 --> 00:15:10.088
Okay. Maybe we should do a song...

85
00:15:10.346 --> 00:15:12.019
Aai, Aai, Aai...

86
00:16:32.862 --> 00:16:34.273
Sis!

87
00:16:34.364 --> 00:16:35.365
Let me sleep.

88
00:16:35.431 --> 00:16:37.240
You'll take a kid's life!

89
00:16:38.501 --> 00:16:39.275
Laila...

90
00:16:39.369 --> 00:16:40.871
You're a rock star!

91
00:16:41.337 --> 00:16:42.941
I love it.

92
00:16:44.073 --> 00:16:45.313
Thank you.

93
00:16:46.809 --> 00:16:49.312
I'll see you tomorrow.

94
00:16:49.379 --> 00:16:51.017
Okay definitely, Laila.

95
00:16:51.114 --> 00:16:52.422
We'll try it with
the band tomorrow.


96
00:16:52.515 --> 00:16:53.687
Okay.

97
00:16:54.083 --> 00:16:55.187
Bye.

98
00:16:55.685 --> 00:16:56.959
Bye Laila.

99
00:17:33.556 --> 00:17:35.035
<i>What?</i>

100
00:17:35.491 --> 00:17:38.131
Trying to fob me off with an SMS.

101
00:17:38.428 --> 00:17:39.600
No.

102
00:17:40.763 --> 00:17:44.370
Don't you think
we should explore other...


103
00:17:44.434 --> 00:17:45.310
Explore?

104
00:17:46.569 --> 00:17:48.412
Am I just an experiment to you?

105
00:17:48.938 --> 00:17:50.076
Please.

106
00:17:51.207 --> 00:17:52.447
Forget it.

107
00:17:52.542 --> 00:17:53.953
It's a great idea!

108
00:17:56.479 --> 00:17:57.423
Okay.

109
00:17:58.414 --> 00:17:59.415
Bye.

110
00:18:00.183 --> 00:18:01.491
Because it sucked.

111
00:18:03.219 --> 00:18:04.698
Yeah?
-Yeah.


112
00:18:05.188 --> 00:18:06.292
Fuck you.

113

Oh fuck you.

114
00:18:08.391 --> 00:18:10.200
And your stupid friends.

115
00:18:12.361 --> 00:18:13.533
Jealous.

116
00:18:14.697 --> 00:18:18.474
<i>V</i>
Being friends with 'normal" people
won't make you "normal."


117
00:18:28.678 --> 00:18:30.487
Asshole.

118
00:18:32.115 --> 00:18:33.423
Coward.

119
00:19:54.697 --> 00:19:55.869
Mom.

120
00:19:57.233 --> 00:19:58.803
Shampoo.

121
00:19:59.202 --> 00:20:00.704
I just shampooed you yesterday.

122
00:20:02.071 --> 00:20:04.608
Please just do it Mom.

123

Who's going to start a fight with you
first thing in the morning!


124
00:20:18.688 --> 00:20:19.689
Mom...

No.

128
00:20:32.735 --> 00:20:35.045
Okay. Don't tell.
You'll get a tummy ache!


129
00:20:44.447 --> 00:20:45.755
Mom.

130
00:20:45.948 --> 00:20:49.122
I like this boy.

134
00:21:00.896 --> 00:21:02.898
Yes. Thafs great.

135
00:21:35.931 --> 00:21:36.841
Hi.

136
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.443
You want a book?

No.

138
00:21:45.875 --> 00:21:48.287
Nima. I have something for you.

139
00:21:50.613 --> 00:21:51.921
Sorry.

140
00:22:03.059 --> 00:22:04.697
What is it? Give it to me.

Shhh.

143
00:24:52.461 --> 00:24:54.031
What a competition!

144
00:24:54.863 --> 00:24:56.433
It was too close.

145
00:24:56.532 --> 00:24:58.375
Okay without delay.

146
00:24:58.634 --> 00:25:00.545

...Ramjas College!

148
00:25:16.785 --> 00:25:19.231
This competition is a milestone.

149
00:25:19.889 --> 00:25:22.130
It's not just about music.

150
00:25:22.524 --> 00:25:28.236
When we heard that the lyricist was
a disabled girl...


151
00:25:28.531 --> 00:25:31.410
...we had to give
the award to her college.


152
00:25:36.238 --> 00:25:37.740
Your journey...

153
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.480
...must have been very difficult
compared to that of a normal musician...


154
00:25:41.577 --> 00:25:43.750
Will you share something with us?

155
00:25:57.059 --> 00:25:59.539
It's okay. What can you
expect from those fuckers?


156
00:26:01.363 --> 00:26:03.570
Laila, this is Tribe's best song.

157
00:26:04.166 --> 00:26:07.739
Maybe Subbu‘s song was better.

158
00:26:08.204 --> 00:26:10.411
Trust me Laila. 
You did a great job.

159
00:26:13.309 --> 00:26:15.949
We totally deserved to win. Okay?

160
00:26:18.814 --> 00:26:22.125
When you‘re there
everythings okay.


161
00:26:22.618 --> 00:26:24.529
The entire bands here for you.

No Nima.

163
00:26:32.261 --> 00:26:33.672
You.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.434
Just you.

165
00:26:46.775 --> 00:26:48.812
Everyone's waiting for us.
Come.


166
00:26:49.345 --> 00:26:50.619
Yeah.

167
00:26:51.513 --> 00:26:53.459
I'll just come.

168
00:27:29.952 --> 00:27:31.226
Careful!

169
00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:36.765
When was the last check up?

170
00:27:36.825 --> 00:27:38.566
Six months ago.

171
00:27:41.163 --> 00:27:42.267
Hopeless!

172
00:27:42.331 --> 00:27:44.834
Excuse me'?
- Sorry, I wasn't talking to you.


173
00:27:45.968 --> 00:27:47.379
Completely ignorant.

174
00:27:47.469 --> 00:27:49.107
Just blabbering nonsense.

175
00:27:50.572 --> 00:27:53.052
As soon as Laila gets admission
to any foreign university...


176
00:27:53.108 --> 00:27:55.452
...I'll personally phone
her and tell her...


177
00:27:55.511 --> 00:27:57.491
...who's normal and
who needs brain surgery!


178
00:27:57.846 --> 00:28:00.417
Why do you jump to foreign
universities at the drop of a hat?


179
00:29:20.562 --> 00:29:24.840
I made a fool of myself.

180
00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.906
It was not just your song.

181
00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:33.483
He doesn't love me Mom.

182
00:29:42.151 --> 00:29:46.031
I can't bear going
to this college anymore.


183
00:30:30.099 --> 00:30:31.100
Come outside.

184
00:30:31.333 --> 00:30:32.437
Why?

185
00:30:32.801 --> 00:30:33.973
Just come.

186
00:30:54.723 --> 00:30:56.066
<i>MW“!</i>

187
00:30:56.124 --> 00:30:57.501
Papa!

188
00:30:58.227 --> 00:31:00.901
Only your mother.
I don't support this.


189
00:31:01.597 --> 00:31:02.701
Why?

190
00:31:04.066 --> 00:31:05.739
What happened in Delhi
University is over.


191
00:31:06.335 --> 00:31:08.110
To go so far away to America...

192
00:31:08.904 --> 00:31:10.941
<i>...it</i> doesn't sit well with me.

193
00:31:11.373 --> 00:31:13.751
And Delhi has other options.

194
00:31:14.743 --> 00:31:15.847
Mom?

195
00:31:17.212 --> 00:31:18.520
Do you want to go?

196
00:31:20.215 --> 00:31:21.956
Don't look there.

197
00:31:23.185 --> 00:31:24.823
You want to go right?

198
00:31:31.627 --> 00:31:33.197
Of course.

199
00:31:37.299 --> 00:31:40.644
You don't come.
The two of us are definitely going!


200
00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.745
Please Papa.

201
00:31:56.485 --> 00:31:58.123
It's one pound over.

202
00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:59.524
That's okay.

203
00:31:59.755 --> 00:32:03.168
With great difficulty I've squeezed
one month's clothing into two suitcases!


204
00:32:03.225 --> 00:32:05.637
Anyway they're not going to charge me
for being one pound overweight!


205
00:32:06.094 --> 00:32:08.973
If they make you repack at the airport -
don't say I didn't warn you!


206
00:32:09.898 --> 00:32:12.936
If you have such a glum face
they'll definitely open them!


207
00:32:14.503 --> 00:32:16.813
One minute.
I'll just be back.


208
00:33:36.918 --> 00:33:41.162
Hello Shubhangani. How are you?

209
00:33:41.223 --> 00:33:42.861
Are you done with packing?
-Yes.


210
00:33:43.659 --> 00:33:45.161
Hi Dhruv.
-Hi


211
00:33:45.827 --> 00:33:48.239
This is for you.
-Oh thank you.


212
00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:48.865
Come inside.

213
00:33:48.964 --> 00:33:49.840
Hi.

214
00:33:57.406 --> 00:33:59.147
You were leaving without saying bye?

215
00:34:00.609 --> 00:34:01.713
Bitch!

216
00:34:47.255 --> 00:34:49.201
Rook to H5.

217
00:34:49.624 --> 00:34:50.602
Hey!

218
00:34:51.426 --> 00:34:52.496
Sorry.

219
00:34:53.261 --> 00:34:55.537
It's okay you can watch.
Just keep your trap shut!


220
00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:56.574
Yeah.

221
00:35:09.144 --> 00:35:11.522
Put it on manual...

222
00:35:12.147 --> 00:35:13.319
It's stuck!

223
00:35:32.701 --> 00:35:35.545
I'm going to tell you right <i>up...</i>
I don't do bottoms!


224
00:35:35.604 --> 00:35:36.981
Excuse me?

225
00:35:37.038 --> 00:35:39.040
I've had some Indian kids before...

226
00:35:39.207 --> 00:35:40.515
You've got to wipe your own ass honey...

227
00:35:40.575 --> 00:35:41.986
I'll just pour the water!

228
00:35:44.646 --> 00:35:47.991
I was just wondering,
if you have anyllexperience with...


229
00:35:48.083 --> 00:35:50.029
...someone with cerebral palsy?

230
00:35:50.085 --> 00:35:53.828
I hope you understand, it is just
the motor skills that are affected...


231
00:35:53.889 --> 00:35:55.664
...and not the intelligence...

232
00:35:55.724 --> 00:35:58.671
I'm quite aware of what
cerebral palsy is actually.


233
00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.240
You don't have to worry at all...
Mrs. Kapoor?


234
00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:04.277
Kapoor pronounced cup not cap.

235
00:36:04.933 --> 00:36:06.105
Cup.

236
00:36:11.806 --> 00:36:13.046
Take this.

237
00:36:15.544 --> 00:36:17.319
Be home by 4.

238
00:36:17.379 --> 00:36:19.757
Or I'll call the cops!

239
00:36:21.383 --> 00:36:23.363
Don't worry Aai.

240
00:36:23.985 --> 00:36:25.157
Bye.

241
00:36:25.253 --> 00:36:26.493
Bye.

242
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:42.944
Hey. How‘re you doing?

243
00:36:43.038 --> 00:36:43.880
Hi.

244
00:36:43.972 --> 00:36:45.280
Come on back.

245
00:36:45.373 --> 00:36:47.979
I have a place all
set up for you on the left.


246
00:36:50.879 --> 00:36:51.949
Where you headed?

247
00:36:52.047 --> 00:36:53.754
Union Square.

248
00:36:53.949 --> 00:36:55.257
Say that again please.

249
00:36:55.317 --> 00:36:57.058
Union Square!

250
00:36:57.118 --> 00:36:59.860
Okay, okay Union Square.
You got it.


251
00:37:09.431 --> 00:37:11.877
Write from your heart...
Write from your eyes...


252
00:37:11.933 --> 00:37:13.913
Write from your liver!

253
00:37:14.402 --> 00:37:16.882
Okay. So what we're going to do
is have an assignment...


254
00:37:16.972 --> 00:37:19.782
<i>...in</i> which you're going to write
from all your senses. Okay?


255
00:37:19.841 --> 00:37:21.650
I'm gonna give you the parameters...

256
00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:24.713
You're going to write a story...
a poem...


257
00:37:25.147 --> 00:37:26.683
...rap Song--

258
00:37:26.781 --> 00:37:28.351
Okay so write these down.

259
00:37:29.951 --> 00:37:31.259
It is...

260
00:37:32.154 --> 00:37:33.792
<i>...New Year's Eve.</i>

261
00:37:34.623 --> 00:37:36.193
You're on a boat.

262
00:37:37.092 --> 00:37:39.163
You hear the sound of a cello.

263
00:37:40.896 --> 00:37:42.705
You taste an orange.

264
00:37:43.765 --> 00:37:45.836
Someone is wearing blue.

265
00:37:47.369 --> 00:37:49.713
And you tell a loved one...

266
00:37:50.171 --> 00:37:52.981
...a very personal secret.

267
00:37:56.178 --> 00:37:57.521
No hiding!

268
00:37:59.347 --> 00:38:01.759
All right you have ten minutes. Go!

269
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:10.628
Hello Laila.
- Hi.


270
00:38:10.725 --> 00:38:12.500
So welcome to the
Creative Writing program.


271
00:38:12.594 --> 00:38:14.073
I'm so glad you
could be here with us.

272
00:38:14.129 --> 00:38:16.507
Thank you, Professor.

273
00:38:16.765 --> 00:38:19.177
It's Jose. It's just Jose.

274
00:38:19.401 --> 00:38:21.403
Okay Jose.

275
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:25.447
Listen. Would you like me
to assign a writer to you?


276
00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.917
In fact I've already talked
to somebody.


277
00:38:26.975 --> 00:38:29.046
Actually I can type...

278
00:38:29.544 --> 00:38:30.989
I am sorry what did you say?

279
00:38:32.447 --> 00:38:34.825
That would be wonderful!

280
00:38:35.183 --> 00:38:36.161
Yeah.

281
00:38:51.066 --> 00:38:52.272
You know...

282
00:38:52.367 --> 00:38:55.507
I have an aunt in Birmingham.

283
00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:57.647
I wish I had an aunt in India!

284
00:38:58.039 --> 00:38:59.712
You know I really want to go there.

285
00:39:00.408 --> 00:39:02.149
My dream place is Varanasi.

286
00:39:02.644 --> 00:39:03.850
H ow come?

287
00:39:04.079 --> 00:39:05.888
My step dad‘s guru is from there.

288
00:39:05.947 --> 00:39:07.722
He came to visit us one time.

289
00:39:07.982 --> 00:39:09.791
He emanated such peace.

290
00:39:10.619 --> 00:39:13.657
It's anything but peaceful!

291
00:39:14.556 --> 00:39:15.398
Really?

292
00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:19.768
You could stay with us
if you come to India.


293
00:39:20.595 --> 00:39:21.903
Are you serious?

294
00:39:23.431 --> 00:39:25.342
That would be absolutely amazing.

295
00:39:29.771 --> 00:39:32.547
ListenmLaila, I should probably go.

296
00:39:33.275 --> 00:39:36.586
Yeah. You have to...
I have to go too.


297
00:39:37.646 --> 00:39:39.523
But I'll see you soon okay'?

298
00:39:40.915 --> 00:39:42.019
Bye.

299
00:39:42.183 --> 00:39:43.719
Bye Laila.

300
00:39:47.522 --> 00:39:51.163
We'll go home now and out your nails.
They've grown too long.


301
00:39:51.526 --> 00:39:54.234
I'm going now to check out the clubs.

302
00:39:54.296 --> 00:39:56.537
Clubs?
-Student clubs.


303
00:39:57.032 --> 00:39:58.943
You've missed a whole semester.

304
00:39:59.467 --> 00:40:00.844
Let's go home now and study.

305
00:40:00.902 --> 00:40:05.282
Mom. I know when I need to study!

306
00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:19.790
Sixteen-year-old Ronnie Martin
was killed by the NYPD.


307
00:40:20.155 --> 00:40:21.964
For only one reason.

308
00:40:22.223 --> 00:40:23.998
He was black.

309
00:40:44.712 --> 00:40:46.123
Fuck the police!

310
00:40:47.749 --> 00:40:49.353
Fuck the police!

311
00:41:46.107 --> 00:41:50.886
These cops are even more dangerous
than the Delhi police!


312
00:41:51.212 --> 00:41:52.555
This is nothing.

313
00:41:57.485 --> 00:41:59.761
Are you from India?

314
00:42:01.623 --> 00:42:03.569
You think all “desis“ are from India.

315
00:42:04.192 --> 00:42:08.197
<i>I didn't mean...
l...I'm sorry...</i>


316
00:42:10.999 --> 00:42:13.206
My mother is from Pakistan.

317
00:42:13.868 --> 00:42:15.745
And my father from Bangladesh.

318
00:42:17.138 --> 00:42:19.914
I've lived in seven countries,
including Madagascar!


319
00:42:20.909 --> 00:42:22.183
Wow.

320
00:42:25.213 --> 00:42:27.454
It's actually quite cool.
That you came out for this.


321
00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:31.023
Usually Indians don't.

322
00:42:34.889 --> 00:42:36.630
I'm Laila.

323
00:42:39.027 --> 00:42:40.529
Khanum.

324
00:42:51.539 --> 00:42:52.574
I'll see you tonight.

325
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.085
Yeah. Cool.

326
00:43:02.283 --> 00:43:03.353
Mom.

327
00:43:15.897 --> 00:43:17.205
Khanum.

328
00:43:17.265 --> 00:43:19.768
This is Aai, my Mom.

329
00:43:19.834 --> 00:43:21.211
Hello Mom.

330
00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:23.344
Hello.

331
00:43:23.771 --> 00:43:26.115
Lailu, why don't you
invite your friend over'?


332
00:43:26.341 --> 00:43:27.649
Khanum, come for dinner.

333
00:43:27.742 --> 00:43:30.586
Mom I'd love to.
But I have a paper due tomorrow.


334
00:43:30.845 --> 00:43:32.882
Come over anytime before I leave.

335
00:43:32.981 --> 00:43:33.823
Definitely.

336
00:43:34.115 --> 00:43:35.093
Bye Laila.

337
00:43:35.149 --> 00:43:36.287

00:43:46.294 --> 00:43:47.739
Let's go.

341
00:43:53.902 --> 00:43:55.347
Mom.

342
00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:31.046
Hey. How's it going?

343
00:44:31.739 --> 00:44:32.843
Good.

344
00:44:33.141 --> 00:44:34.415
I'm sorry I'm late.

345
00:44:34.475 --> 00:44:36.079
I got held up at lunch.

346
00:44:37.478 --> 00:44:39.424
So. Do you wanna get started?

347
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.322
Yeah.

348
00:44:40.415 --> 00:44:41.450
Okay.

349
00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:44.423
Have you chosen a topic
for the assignment?


350
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:50.169
I want to talk about
my first relationship.


351
00:44:51.092 --> 00:44:52.196
Yeah.

352
00:44:53.261 --> 00:44:54.262
Yeah.

353
00:44:54.329 --> 00:44:56.570
There's this guy Nima...

354
00:44:58.166 --> 00:45:01.443
When I fell in love with him...

355
00:45:02.971 --> 00:45:04.473
...it was like...

356
00:45:05.573 --> 00:45:07.780
...electricity...you know!

357
00:45:09.544 --> 00:45:11.251
Yeah, yeah. I do know yeah.

358
00:45:11.312 --> 00:45:12.620
Yeah.

359
00:45:14.415 --> 00:45:17.487
And the first time he...

360
00:45:17.986 --> 00:45:19.465
...touched me...

361
00:45:22.256 --> 00:45:24.031
You mean you've had sex'?

362
00:45:26.527 --> 00:45:29.235
Was that your...girlfriend?

363
00:45:30.064 --> 00:45:31.168
Who?

364
00:45:31.532 --> 00:45:35.275
The girl you were lip locked
with just now.


365
00:45:36.204 --> 00:45:38.206
No. No. She's just a friend.

366
00:45:41.275 --> 00:45:42.481
Wow.

367
00:45:44.045 --> 00:45:45.922
ls kissing in India a big deal?

368
00:45:47.181 --> 00:45:51.323
Well you don't smooch your friends,
that's for sure!


369
00:45:51.386 --> 00:45:53.195
Oh so if I kiss you
I'd have to marry you then?


370
00:45:55.957 --> 00:45:57.027
No.

371
00:46:32.593 --> 00:46:33.901
Hello.

372
00:46:35.163 --> 00:46:37.234
Hi, It's Laila.

373
00:46:38.866 --> 00:46:43.315
I was just wondering
what you are up to?


374
00:46:46.407 --> 00:46:49.388
Yeah that would be great.

375
00:46:51.612 --> 00:46:52.818
Okay.

376
00:46:54.115 --> 00:46:55.287
Bye.

377
00:47:07.094 --> 00:47:08.664
Come inside.

378
00:47:13.901 --> 00:47:15.403
|‘m looking for Miles Davis...

379
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:16.710
“Speeches of Spain?

380
00:47:17.171 --> 00:47:19.378
Okay, we should have that.
Give me one second.


381
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.985
May I help you Miss?

382
00:47:22.043 --> 00:47:23.488
I'm okay.

383
00:47:23.978 --> 00:47:25.355
Where are you from?

384
00:47:25.413 --> 00:47:26.858
India.

385
00:47:27.248 --> 00:47:29.421
Wow! Let me show you something
I think you'll really like.


386
00:47:34.622 --> 00:47:36.101
WOW!

387
00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:44.406
How much is it?

388
00:47:44.465 --> 00:47:48.072
Well I can give you 10% off...
so that would make it only 749 dollars...


389
00:47:48.136 --> 00:47:49.376
...which is a really good deal!

390
00:47:49.437 --> 00:47:51.383
<i>I wish...</i>

391
00:47:51.639 --> 00:47:54.620
I'm on a scholarship.

392
00:47:54.942 --> 00:47:57.218
Let me go talk to my manager
and I'll see what I can do for you.


393
00:47:57.712 --> 00:47:59.555
Ask him for...

394
00:47:59.614 --> 00:48:02.322
...5o% off!

395
00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:05.793
I don't know if I can do 50%.
But I like you. So I'll see what I can do!


396
00:48:05.887 --> 00:48:07.025
Yeah.

397
00:48:22.637 --> 00:48:24.776
This is my secret haunts.

398
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:39.559
Close your eyes you will see better.

399
00:48:46.861 --> 00:48:49.671
These are the three concentric circles.

400
00:48:51.499 --> 00:48:53.536
This is a depiction of the world.

401
00:48:56.904 --> 00:49:00.283
It is encircled by a beautiful
naked figure of a woman...


402
00:49:02.944 --> 00:49:05.083
...the sky goddess Nut.

403
00:49:08.115 --> 00:49:11.119
Whose body is bent protectively
over the world.


404
00:49:13.254 --> 00:49:14.824
Relax!

405
00:49:15.256 --> 00:49:17.497
Until now only you have seen me.

406
00:49:17.825 --> 00:49:19.236
Let me see you too.

407
00:49:42.083 --> 00:49:42.891
Bitch!

408
00:49:42.984 --> 00:49:44.122
<i>What?</i>

409
00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.431
Dude you are so pretty.

410
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:51.229
So pretty that I feel like cursing you!

411
00:50:17.852 --> 00:50:20.059
I didn't know you play chess?

412
00:50:21.055 --> 00:50:22.159
Check.

413
00:50:22.823 --> 00:50:24.268
You're next to get beaten.

414
00:50:24.692 --> 00:50:26.535
Just like everybody else out here!

415
00:50:27.228 --> 00:50:28.536
Your turn.

416
00:50:28.596 --> 00:50:31.873
You're too much! 
You are too much!

417
00:50:44.245 --> 00:50:47.556
Pass my costume.

418
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:04.303
Come let's get you changed.

419
00:51:41.302 --> 00:51:42.212
Ballu.

420
00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:45.616
There's such amazing snowfall here.

421
00:51:46.641 --> 00:51:49.247
And the room cozy and warm
with central heating.


422
00:51:54.282 --> 00:51:56.592
Remember I told you about Khanum?

423
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:58.525
She's a very helpful girl.

424
00:51:58.853 --> 00:52:02.062
Tonight Lai|u‘s going for a study
sleep over at her house.


425
00:52:11.899 --> 00:52:13.037
Hi. What can I get you?

426
00:52:13.134 --> 00:52:14.636
Can I have a house white please?

427
00:52:14.702 --> 00:52:15.703
Sure.

428
00:52:17.772 --> 00:52:18.842
A coke.

429
00:52:19.307 --> 00:52:20.513
<i>What?</i>

430
00:52:20.574 --> 00:52:22.019
You think this is McDonalds?

431
00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:23.218
Have a drink!

432
00:52:23.277 --> 00:52:25.621
I've never had one...

433
00:52:26.046 --> 00:52:27.423
Why don't you look at our cocktail list?

434
00:52:27.948 --> 00:52:29.757
Our Pina Coladas are really popular.

435
00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:36.325
We have Sex on the Beach, Mojitos,
Manhattans... Anything you like.


436
00:52:37.725 --> 00:52:39.261
Can I have a...

437
00:52:39.326 --> 00:52:40.896
Margarita?

438
00:52:41.328 --> 00:52:42.966
With a straw.

439
00:52:43.197 --> 00:52:46.041
Great choice. Okay, coming right up!

440
00:52:47.435 --> 00:52:48.914
Have you ever dated?

441
00:52:50.604 --> 00:52:53.881
Why would anyone date me?

442
00:52:53.941 --> 00:52:56.820
Why do you put yourself down
all the time?


443
00:52:57.111 --> 00:52:58.920
Let me do it for you!

444
00:53:00.614 --> 00:53:03.925
Because that has been my experience.

445
00:53:05.119 --> 00:53:06.894
For the last time...

446
00:53:08.455 --> 00:53:10.526
You are very beautiful.

447
00:53:14.328 --> 00:53:17.537
Okay! One white wine and
a Margarita, with a straw, for you.


448
00:53:17.631 --> 00:53:18.666
Thank you.

449
00:53:18.732 --> 00:53:19.836
You 're very welcome.

450
00:55:01.635 --> 00:55:03.046
Thank you.

451
00:55:07.641 --> 00:55:09.086
Can I get you some wine?

452
00:55:11.545 --> 00:55:14.549
No. I have a headache.

453
00:55:19.754 --> 00:55:22.234
You need one exotic head massage.

454
00:55:24.825 --> 00:55:26.634
And by mistake if I strangle you,

455
00:55:26.961 --> 00:55:28.634
forgive my blindness!

456
00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:08.792
Lailu! Thats enough time in the bath!

457
00:59:11.785 --> 00:59:13.059
<i>MW“!</i>

458
00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:16.966
There's no end to the hot water here!

459
00:59:29.370 --> 00:59:30.440
Will you come out?

460
00:59:31.105 --> 00:59:32.083
Why?

461
00:59:45.386 --> 00:59:46.831
Where's your gold chain?

462
00:59:49.256 --> 00:59:50.860
It must have fallen off.

463
00:59:51.525 --> 00:59:55.496
It had such a strong clasp.
How can it just fall off?


464
01:00:00.167 --> 01:00:01.771
It's not in the bathroom either.

465
01:00:02.903 --> 01:00:04.439
The caregiver must have taken it!

466
01:00:04.905 --> 01:00:08.284
We trust these people
and they take advantage.


467
01:00:09.309 --> 01:00:12.085
I'm going to phone her right now. Nlaybe
that's why she didn't come to work today.


468
01:00:12.145 --> 01:00:13.317
Mom...

469
01:00:13.947 --> 01:00:15.858
No Lailu.
It can only be her.


470
01:00:15.949 --> 01:00:17.724
I pawned it!

471
01:00:19.186 --> 01:00:20.529
<i>What?</i>

472
01:00:21.388 --> 01:00:23.698
I bought an lPad.

473
01:00:24.424 --> 01:00:26.062
It's really cool.

474
01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:29.972
It even has a voice activator.

475
01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:32.401
It was your grandmother's chain!

476
01:00:33.834 --> 01:00:36.440
What's happened to you Lailu?

477
01:00:37.638 --> 01:00:41.643
But I wanted it for my studies...

478
01:00:42.275 --> 01:00:45.586
Studies?
Surfing porn sites is studying?!


479
01:00:45.912 --> 01:00:48.153
You should be ashamed of yourself.

480
01:00:49.683 --> 01:00:51.788
How dare you?

481
01:00:51.885 --> 01:00:54.365
This is my privacy.

482
01:00:54.421 --> 01:00:59.598
Privacy? You want privacy from me'?!
I'll slap you if you talk to me like that.


483
01:01:48.942 --> 01:01:50.478
Move in with me.

484
01:01:53.013 --> 01:01:55.584
And what should I tell my parents?

485
01:01:56.149 --> 01:01:59.221
Even in their wildest dreams
they wouldn't guess that we're lovers!


486
01:02:32.252 --> 01:02:36.428
I will miss you Mom.

487
01:02:59.613 --> 01:03:01.456
Bye.
- Bye.


488
01:03:28.909 --> 01:03:30.616
Oh fuck!

489
01:04:11.551 --> 01:04:13.121
Keep the place.

490
01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:15.925
The University pays for it anyway.

491
01:04:17.057 --> 01:04:21.301
Always have a place of your own, so no
motherfucker can put you on the street.


492
01:04:23.063 --> 01:04:25.805
Give me the address.
I'll go there tomorrow morning.


493
01:04:26.099 --> 01:04:29.774
Oh ifs okay.
Khanum can take care of me.


494
01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:35.076
That's a big no no. People don't like
to be carers and lovers at the same time.


495
01:04:39.112 --> 01:04:40.523
Besides...

496
01:04:41.214 --> 01:04:43.023
That would put me out of work.

497
01:04:51.024 --> 01:04:54.836
You can stay here while I'm gone...
if you like.


498
01:05:32.566 --> 01:05:36.343
After all this renovation you better not
break up with me for at least <i>2</i> years!


499
01:05:51.318 --> 01:05:52.592
Do you want lip gloss?

500
01:05:52.652 --> 01:05:53.653
Yes.

501
01:07:51.638 --> 01:07:54.312
Lailu. Come home in
the summer break.


502
01:07:54.674 --> 01:07:56.915
Did you just win the lottery?

503
01:07:57.010 --> 01:07:59.752
I still haven't repaid the
debt of your outgoing flight...


504
01:07:59.813 --> 01:08:01.759
...so might as well add the cost of
another flight to it!


505
01:08:01.815 --> 01:08:04.318
<i>Happy Ho“ Papa.</i>

506
01:08:04.684 --> 01:08:05.594
Hello Mom.

507
01:08:05.652 --> 01:08:07.131
How are you Khanum?

508
01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.163
I'm good. Thanks.

509
01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:13.070
Why don't you also
come to India with Laila?


510
01:08:13.726 --> 01:08:17.230
I really want to come Mom.
But Laila never invites me!


511
01:08:17.597 --> 01:08:18.439
What happened?

512
01:08:18.531 --> 01:08:21.137
Nothing.
I'll definitely come now!


513
01:08:21.534 --> 01:08:24.071
Just pray to Allah
that I get my visa.

514
01:08:25.038 --> 01:08:25.914
You must come.

515
01:08:26.006 --> 01:08:27.041
Yes.

516
01:08:29.309 --> 01:08:30.788
Where's Nlonu?

517
01:08:30.844 --> 01:08:32.323
In the bathroom. As always!

518
01:08:32.679 --> 01:08:34.590
Here you go. Your receipfs in the bag.

519
01:08:35.181 --> 01:08:35.852
Thank you.

520
01:08:35.915 --> 01:08:36.950
You 're welcome.

521
01:08:48.728 --> 01:08:50.639
Don't move anything around.

522
01:09:03.042 --> 01:09:05.454
When did you figure out...

523
01:09:06.079 --> 01:09:07.114
that..

524
01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:08.090
you know..

525
01:09:09.783 --> 01:09:11.820
...you‘re gay?

526
01:09:28.067 --> 01:09:30.547
Your body is perfect.

527
01:09:30.937 --> 01:09:33.611
You could be a model.

528
01:09:34.641 --> 01:09:37.588
Have you ever seen a model who's blind?

529
01:09:39.612 --> 01:09:42.320
I've known I'm gay
since I was fourteen.


530
01:09:44.217 --> 01:09:45.457
Wow.

531
01:09:46.886 --> 01:09:50.265
I wish I could be that certain.

532
01:09:56.496 --> 01:09:58.601
You know I was okay
with the realisation.


533
01:10:00.567 --> 01:10:05.107
But the main problem
was parents and relatives.


534
01:10:06.072 --> 01:10:09.053
You have to lie all the time. And then
spend hours feeling guilty about lying.


535
01:10:09.943 --> 01:10:11.854
Just wasn't my thing.

536
01:10:12.879 --> 01:10:14.017
So I told them.

537
01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.151
Then? What happened?

538
01:10:18.084 --> 01:10:19.620
My mother kissed me...

539
01:10:20.587 --> 01:10:21.497
...and hugged me!

540
01:10:21.555 --> 01:10:22.932
No way!

541
01:10:22.989 --> 01:10:24.991
Of course not.

542
01:10:25.658 --> 01:10:27.103
There was a full scale drama!

543
01:10:27.494 --> 01:10:29.201
First there were slaps...

544
01:10:30.129 --> 01:10:31.699
...then emotional blackmail...

545
01:10:32.699 --> 01:10:34.007
<i>...counseling...</i>

546
01:10:34.067 --> 01:10:35.740
...howling...weeping.

547
01:10:36.836 --> 01:10:38.110
Then?

548
01:10:43.276 --> 01:10:45.415
My mother took me to a doctor...

549
01:10:47.113 --> 01:10:49.957
As if I had some disease
that could be cured.


550
01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:52.125
Oh god.

551
01:10:53.353 --> 01:10:55.526
When all her efforts failed
she finally


552
01:10:57.824 --> 01:10:59.667
...stopped talking to me.

553
01:10:59.726 --> 01:11:01.899
ls she still angry with you?

554
01:11:04.264 --> 01:11:06.505
Last week after
she'd had a fight with my Dad...


555
01:11:07.267 --> 01:11:09.076
...she phoned me and said...

556
01:11:09.836 --> 01:11:13.807
“Thank God you will never ever have to
deal with men!“


557
01:11:13.873 --> 01:11:18.322
My parents would have a heart attack!

558
01:11:22.248 --> 01:11:25.058
For me I just like to be
who I am all the time.


559
01:11:27.954 --> 01:11:30.594
This is scary for me.

560
01:11:33.359 --> 01:11:35.270
It's wonderful...

561
01:11:36.096 --> 01:11:39.168
...but so scary.

562
01:12:38.091 --> 01:12:40.367
It's tipping down with rain!

563
01:12:48.334 --> 01:12:51.508
You can do some
work too you know!


564
01:12:52.038 --> 01:12:56.578
No. Now that I know you can type so well...
and were conning me all this while...!


565
01:12:57.744 --> 01:12:59.087
<i>It's because I...</i>

566
01:12:59.145 --> 01:13:01.591
<i>...l</i> thought you were cute!

567
01:13:02.215 --> 01:13:03.751
So you don't think I'm cute any more'?

568
01:13:08.021 --> 01:13:09.659
Now I have a...

569
01:13:11.524 --> 01:13:13.800
...I'm with someone.

570
01:13:14.761 --> 01:13:15.899
3o?

571
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:27.074
Can I use your bathroom?

572
01:13:27.373 --> 01:13:28.716
Yeah, ifs just on the left.

573
01:13:31.244 --> 01:13:33.315
Oh. I should help you.

574
01:13:36.316 --> 01:13:37.693
Okay.

575
01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:15.959
Okay. I'm done.

576
01:15:01.234 --> 01:15:02.679
Can I straighten your leg?

577
01:15:02.735 --> 01:15:03.975
Yeah.

578
01:15:12.011 --> 01:15:13.547
Just relax okay?

579
01:15:13.646 --> 01:15:15.922
I'm feeling shit scared.

580
01:15:16.015 --> 01:15:18.928
Scared'? Don't worry.

581
01:15:19.652 --> 01:15:20.824
Yeah.

582
01:16:26.219 --> 01:16:28.256
I have bad news for you.

583
01:16:29.622 --> 01:16:31.101
<i>What?</i>

584
01:16:42.602 --> 01:16:44.878
The Indian government
has denied my visa.


585
01:16:55.148 --> 01:16:57.094
I've got the visa and the ticket!

586
01:16:57.183 --> 01:17:02.030
Here Comes the Bride...“

587
01:17:56.409 --> 01:17:57.479
Maharashtrian eggplant!

588
01:17:57.543 --> 01:17:58.453
Again?

589
01:17:58.644 --> 01:17:59.554
So what?

590
01:18:00.213 --> 01:18:01.157
Nothing.

591
01:18:02.248 --> 01:18:03.989
No. Go ahead.
Just say it!


592
01:18:04.283 --> 01:18:05.660
What should I say?

593
01:18:06.252 --> 01:18:08.755
It might even be possible
to see a lion eating grass...


594
01:18:08.854 --> 01:18:12.131
But to see a Punjabi
eating this stuff everyday...!


595
01:18:13.125 --> 01:18:15.537
Can't show my face in the community!

596
01:18:15.595 --> 01:18:17.734
So you should have
married that Punjabi girl...


597
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:19.138
Can't remember her name.

598
01:18:19.332 --> 01:18:20.367
Harneet.

599
01:18:22.168 --> 01:18:23.340
Yes. H arneet!

600
01:18:23.503 --> 01:18:26.143
She could make you
your roti and butter chicken!


601
01:18:26.739 --> 01:18:29.219
Khanum my child.
Tell me - what's wrong with this?


602
01:18:29.308 --> 01:18:31.015
It's really yummy.

603
01:18:31.411 --> 01:18:32.355
Heard?

604
01:18:32.512 --> 01:18:33.217
Did you hear?

605
01:18:33.279 --> 01:18:34.189
Yes. I heard.

606
01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.920
You should have made something else.

607
01:18:52.431 --> 01:18:53.739
Are you sure?

608
01:18:55.268 --> 01:18:56.804
Yes. She is.

609
01:18:59.372 --> 01:19:00.817
Thafs great.

610
01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:02.976
Evolved choice.

611
01:19:06.245 --> 01:19:07.690
How will you have kids?

612
01:19:09.215 --> 01:19:10.990
Get with the century, dude!

613
01:19:12.385 --> 01:19:16.197
If Aunty finds out - there'll not just be
bomb blasts but serial blasts!


614
01:19:17.890 --> 01:19:19.631
Mom's not like that at all!

615
01:19:20.159 --> 01:19:22.400
I've known Aunty for 540 years!

616
01:19:25.364 --> 01:19:26.900
Don't under estimate her.

617
01:19:27.733 --> 01:19:29.542
Mom is a ‘rockstaf

618
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:33.316
She is way ahead of my own ammi.

619
01:19:36.042 --> 01:19:37.715
And I came out to her.

620
01:20:02.635 --> 01:20:04.876
Mom. I'm Bi.

621
01:20:05.972 --> 01:20:07.451
Am I any less of a maid (Bai)?

622
01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:08.975
<i>What?!</i>

623
01:20:09.275 --> 01:20:14.315
No matter how educated Indian men are,
at some level women are just maids!


624
01:20:14.847 --> 01:20:16.417
Look at your own father.

625
01:20:16.516 --> 01:20:19.554
Come what may -
he just wants my cooking.


626
01:20:20.119 --> 01:20:24.158
They should be lined up
and made to wash clothes!


627
01:20:24.256 --> 01:20:27.100
Really Lailu.
I'm not joking.


628
01:20:27.827 --> 01:20:29.738
I know!

629
01:20:34.367 --> 01:20:35.402
<i>MW“!</i>

630
01:20:39.338 --> 01:20:40.976
I love you, Mom.

631
01:20:41.574 --> 01:20:43.019
Love you too.

632
01:22:51.570 --> 01:22:52.878
Mom...

633
01:22:53.305 --> 01:22:59.688
You look like a heroine
with your short hair.


634
01:23:16.896 --> 01:23:20.935
You know that thing I was
saying about being Bi....


635
01:23:21.033 --> 01:23:24.640
Now you're well and truly a maid.
Because of me.


636
01:23:26.339 --> 01:23:27.477
Give.

637
01:23:30.209 --> 01:23:31.688
I meant...

638
01:23:34.313 --> 01:23:36.259
Bisexual.

639
01:23:37.783 --> 01:23:38.921
Bi....what?

640
01:23:39.885 --> 01:23:41.125
What does it mean?

641
01:23:46.826 --> 01:23:50.603
I love Khanum, Mom.

642
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:54.676
Yes. We all love her.
She's so nice.


643
01:23:56.435 --> 01:24:00.747
Khanum‘s my girlfriend!

644
01:24:18.123 --> 01:24:19.193
Yuck.

645
01:24:33.439 --> 01:24:36.682
Not done Mom.
You're being a hypocrite.


646
01:24:37.276 --> 01:24:40.416
Who's put this in your head?
There's nothing hypocritical here.


647
01:24:45.617 --> 01:24:47.062
Of course there is!

648
01:24:47.453 --> 01:24:50.195
Don't argue Laila.
This isn't normal.


649
01:24:55.694 --> 01:24:59.665
That's what the world said
about me too.


650
01:25:00.366 --> 01:25:02.778
What's your problem now'?

651
01:25:27.326 --> 01:25:28.737
Ask!

652
01:25:28.928 --> 01:25:30.066
You ask.

653
01:25:30.129 --> 01:25:31.437
No. You.

654
01:25:35.467 --> 01:25:37.640
Monu‘s insisting on being taken
to the cricket match!


655
01:25:38.504 --> 01:25:41.144
If we don't buy the tickets today
there'll be none left.


656
01:25:41.473 --> 01:25:43.680
Ask your mother.
What can I say!


657
01:25:43.976 --> 01:25:45.319
Mom. Please!

658
01:25:45.377 --> 01:25:47.050
I've even finished studying.

659
01:25:47.146 --> 01:25:49.353
This is Khanum‘s first trip to India...

660
01:25:49.548 --> 01:25:53.325
How can we let her go
without watching a cricket match!


661
01:25:53.852 --> 01:25:54.853
<i>MW“!</i>

662
01:25:59.124 --> 01:26:01.263
Papa. Now you handle it!

663
01:26:01.327 --> 01:26:03.204
What can I do!

664
01:26:09.835 --> 01:26:11.644
Monu. Play gently.

665
01:26:14.006 --> 01:26:15.144
Play-

666
01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:20.148
Go Khanum!
-Play.


667
01:26:48.307 --> 01:26:50.344
Where‘s Mom?

668
01:26:50.643 --> 01:26:54.022
She's inside.
The doctor said we can see her soon.


669
01:26:54.513 --> 01:26:57.392
Why has she been admitted?

670
01:27:02.655 --> 01:27:06.364
Your mother has colon cancer.
Second stage. Relapse.


671
01:27:13.966 --> 01:27:16.310
Your mother's a fighter.

672
01:27:17.436 --> 01:27:19.109
She will definitely beat it.

673
01:27:32.017 --> 01:27:33.724
One of you has to wait outside.

674
01:27:34.953 --> 01:27:35.954
Okay.

675
01:27:58.644 --> 01:28:00.089
Sorry.

676
01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:16.835
Nothing will happen.

677
01:28:21.934 --> 01:28:24.039
Go back to America.

678
01:28:34.046 --> 01:28:35.957
How's Khanum?

679
01:29:34.439 --> 01:29:36.077
Okay?
-Yeah.


680
01:29:49.822 --> 01:29:52.769
I'm sorry Khanum.

681
01:29:55.494 --> 01:29:57.770
You're not coming back
to New York right'?


682
01:29:57.996 --> 01:30:01.239
I am. Definitely.

683
01:30:10.075 --> 01:30:13.022
One day....in New York

684
01:30:13.779 --> 01:30:16.350
At Jared's house...

685
01:30:17.850 --> 01:30:20.558
While we were working...

686
01:30:22.621 --> 01:30:25.830
I had sex with him.

687
01:30:29.561 --> 01:30:31.438
What do you mean?

688
01:30:34.066 --> 01:30:35.909
When we were together?

689
01:30:37.369 --> 01:30:39.110
Once.

690
01:30:41.173 --> 01:30:42.777
How could you?

691
01:30:47.345 --> 01:30:50.189
I wasn't thinking.

692
01:30:54.686 --> 01:31:01.729
I was confused...
I know what I did was wrong.


693
01:31:03.195 --> 01:31:06.074
So by fucking you, Jared
gave you a certificate of “normalcy”?


694
01:31:06.131 --> 01:31:07.303
No.

695
01:31:10.268 --> 01:31:13.374
It happened in the moment.
-How convenient .


696
01:31:19.511 --> 01:31:23.288
Jared could see me.

697
01:31:24.549 --> 01:31:26.460
That's why.

698
01:32:48.433 --> 01:32:49.912
You used me!

699
01:32:52.804 --> 01:32:54.841
To take care of you...

700
01:32:56.108 --> 01:32:58.281
...Fill your loneliness.

701
01:33:11.356 --> 01:33:14.633
So I was a stopgap till
you could find a boyfriend right?


702
01:33:14.726 --> 01:33:19.539
No Khanum.
That's not fair.


703
01:33:20.432 --> 01:33:24.278
After doing all this you have the
fucking balls to call me unfair?


704
01:33:30.642 --> 01:33:32.553
You should have told me then
and finished it off.


705
01:33:33.412 --> 01:33:35.756
Why carry on a Charade all this while?

706
01:33:38.917 --> 01:33:42.228
I didn't want to lose you.

707
01:33:47.726 --> 01:33:49.205
<i>Now what?</i>

708
01:33:50.662 --> 01:33:53.142
You think I won't leave because of Mom.

709
01:33:55.801 --> 01:33:59.476
I don't want secrets anymore.

710
01:34:37.575 --> 01:34:39.054
Laila...

711
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:40.180
<i>What?</i>

712
01:34:40.278 --> 01:34:42.053
Lailu. My feet are feeling cold.

713
01:34:42.647 --> 01:34:46.891
Nurse. Can we get
some woollen socks please?


714
01:34:47.219 --> 01:34:49.062
The blanket should suffice.

715
01:34:50.222 --> 01:34:53.533
Nurse. Socks! Now!

716
01:34:56.361 --> 01:34:58.068
One minute, Mom.

717
01:35:19.117 --> 01:35:22.189
No. Just let it
be for a little longer.

718
01:35:24.422 --> 01:35:25.696
Please.

719
01:35:39.537 --> 01:35:41.608
Good girl, Mom.

720
01:37:23.308 --> 01:37:25.549
I'm sorry. She is gone.

721
01:39:17.822 --> 01:39:21.292
Papa. Can you play this for Mom?

722
01:39:21.359 --> 01:39:23.737
Laila, my child,
let the rituals be over first.


723
01:39:25.930 --> 01:39:27.273
Monu, get the CD.

724
01:39:50.489 --> 01:39:52.594
Panditji, one moment please.

725
01:41:48.039 --> 01:41:49.848
Was it really necessary to tell me?

726
01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:56.888
Yes.

727
01:42:03.354 --> 01:42:06.801
Khanum, Laila, hurry up!
Its getting late to go to the airport.


728
01:43:58.937 --> 01:44:01.178
Your straight hair is great.

729
01:44:01.406 --> 01:44:06.480
Tony, please try
something different today.


730
01:44:06.544 --> 01:44:08.285
Of course!

731
01:44:12.583 --> 01:44:14.290
Hi.
-Hi.


732
01:44:14.786 --> 01:44:17.995
Hey listen. We're going for a movie.
Do you want to come'?


733
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:20.729
Some other time.

734
01:44:21.159 --> 01:44:22.604
Why?

735
01:44:23.294 --> 01:44:25.706
I have a date.

736
01:44:26.597 --> 01:44:28.668
Helloooo! With who?

737
01:44:50.788 --> 01:44:52.290
Come

738
01:45:05.236 --> 01:45:06.681
Bye.

739
01:45:10.407 --> 01:45:12.353
Ma'am. Your Margarita.

740
01:45:16.447 --> 01:45:18.927
Pour it into this please.

741
01:45:23.955 --> 01:45:25.491
Thank you.
