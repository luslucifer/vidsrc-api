NARRATOR: Over the last few years,
mankind has been witness


3
00:02:48.353 --> 00:02:53.008
to a continual parade
of environmental disasters,


4
00:02:53.108 --> 00:02:59.229
leaving many searching for a ray of hope
in an already bleak landscape.


5
00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:05.852
This is it, isn't it? Oh, jeez.

6
00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:08.855
Look at this. Look at this!
And it's mine.


7
00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:11.106
The place is the Arizona desert.

00:03:11.206 --> 00:03:14.568
A team of scientists and investors,
led by Dr Noah Faulkner,


9
00:03:14.668 --> 00:03:17.946
has come together to create
the first space station on Earth,


10
00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:20.740
a self-contained world,
a pure environment,


11
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.494
unspoiled, unpolluted, a world
that no longer exists outside.


12
00:03:25.594 --> 00:03:30.206
This Earth Day, Dr Faulkner and four
carefully chosen, qualified scientists


13
00:03:30.306 --> 00:03:34.794
will seal themselves inside,
their mission to sustain life for one year


14
00:03:34.894 --> 00:03:37.796
while living in harmony with nature.

15
00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:43.135
Welcome to Bio-Dome! Congratulations,
Bio-Dome Five, and good luck!


16
00:03:43.235 --> 00:03:47.847
On your steady shoulders rest the hopes
and dreams of the scientific community,


17
00:03:47.947 --> 00:03:52.111
and perhaps the very survival
of the human race.

Perfect.

Hi, Mo-Mo!
Porky! Thanks for coming over!


30
00:04:49.793 --> 00:04:51.906
Hey, Budly.

31
00:04:56.548 --> 00:04:58.625
Agh!

32
00:04:59.218 --> 00:05:02.913
- You guys ready to go?
- See, that's the thing. Uh...


33
00:05:03.013 --> 00:05:06.040
You know we're meant to go with you
to this thing in the park?


34
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.292
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


35
00:05:07.392 --> 00:05:10.133
- Don't mimic me.
- Don't mimic me.


36
00:05:11.396 --> 00:05:14.590
Listen, we can't go.
Doyle had a bad accident.


37
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.636
- BOTH: What?!
- I'll show you.


38
00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:21.095
- Look at his wrist. It's quivering.
- My God! What happened?


39
00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:24.890
- I'm no doctor, but I think he's braindead.
- Yeah. And?


40
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.227
Um... Well, in tribute
to Earth Day, right,


41
00:05:28.327 --> 00:05:32.856
Doyle was up on the couch
trying to take down the mahimahi,


42
00:05:32.956 --> 00:05:34.900
and set it free.

43
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.487
"Free mahimahi! Free mahimahi!",
if you will, and then kaboom!


44
00:05:40.587 --> 00:05:44.325
Gravity snatched the poor little boy,
and he fell down like a rag doll.


45
00:05:44.425 --> 00:05:47.952
This wouldn't be one of your
convenient accidents, would it?


46
00:05:48.052 --> 00:05:52.123
Monique, look. You call a huge welt
in the guy's head an accident?


47
00:05:52.223 --> 00:05:54.583
I can't make that up. See?

48
00:05:54.683 --> 00:05:57.252
- Huh?
- Please let me out, Mommy.


49
00:05:57.352 --> 00:06:00.172
Or at least slide
another pancake under the door.


50
00:06:00.272 --> 00:06:03.925
Oh, my poor Doyly. 
I'll nurse you.

51
00:06:04.025 --> 00:06:06.052
OK, let's play nurse.

52
00:06:06.152 --> 00:06:11.264
- I smell a scam.
- No, it's Doyle. He's got a quivery colon.


53
00:06:11.364 --> 00:06:14.684
Damn it, but you guys promised
to help us pick up trash today.


54
00:06:14.784 --> 00:06:18.812
Yeah. Earth Day's all about
saving the environment.


55
00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:23.234
You're thinking too globally.
You have to act locally.


56
00:06:23.334 --> 00:06:27.445
We need to stay here and help Doyle
merge on the road to recovery.


57
00:06:27.545 --> 00:06:31.115
All right, Bud. 
You win - again.

58
00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:35.285
Win?! This isn't a contest, Monique.
It's not a game here.


59
00:06:35.385 --> 00:06:37.996
Come on. Give me a kiss.

60
00:06:38.096 --> 00:06:40.791
Come on. It's not my fault
his brain cramped up.


61
00:06:40.891 --> 00:06:43.169
You little dick!

62
00:06:44.352 --> 00:06:49.264
Brain cramp my butt! The only thing
that hit Doyle's head is this book!


63
00:06:49.647 --> 00:06:51.883
Ow! Oww!

64
00:06:51.983 --> 00:06:55.595
I can't believe you'd crack Doyle's skull
just to get out of this!


65
00:06:55.695 --> 00:06:58.931
You don't understand.
The book fell on him. I mean...


66
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:02.017
- He fell on the book. They collided.
- Bullshit!


67
00:07:02.117 --> 00:07:06.103
It is just like you to try to weasel out
of your responsibilities on Earth Day.


68

This is "Hands Across America"

69

- I had arthritis.
- Farm Aid?


70
00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:14.736
- I had fleas.
- The Save the Whales rally?


71
00:07:14.836 --> 00:07:17.990
- Salt water makes Doyle bloat?
- You guys are pathetic.

They're taking yoga.

about how flexible Bud is getting.

77
00:07:33.061 --> 00:07:35.922
There is something about a man
who can lick his own back.


78
00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:40.217
- We just have to be patient.
- Freeing the mahimahi?


79
00:07:40.317 --> 00:07:42.511
What kind of mind
thinks up crap like that?


80

- They should be punished.

It's great, but we're gonna split.

93

These guys from Arizona Tech
are taking us to a kegger at Vasquez Lake.


94
00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:39.811
What?! You met men?
Of the male persuasion?


95

Oh, and they're on the swim team.

- What's goin' on? What?


97
00:08:47.418 --> 00:08:49.862
Monique, Doyle and I
just talked it over,


98
00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:55.825
and we decided you cannot go to that
kegger party with the swimmers, OK?

Whatever, Bud.

00:09:02.514 --> 00:09:07.793
Doyle, our girls have been seduced
by breaststrokers.


102
00:09:07.894 --> 00:09:10.469
They bought it!

103
00:09:11.105 --> 00:09:13.383
- Swimmers!
- Uh-huh.


104
00:09:13.483 --> 00:09:15.968
Do you know how many diseases
there are in pools?


105
00:09:16.068 --> 00:09:18.554
- Especially after we swim in them.
- I know.


106
00:09:18.654 --> 00:09:24.058
I can't believe this! Shaved-down
pool Nazis oiling up our women, man!


107
00:09:24.158 --> 00:09:27.103
And swimming with them
in an Olympic-size toilet.


108
00:09:27.203 --> 00:09:30.940
You ever see

Can you believe those girls?

111
00:09:40.714 --> 00:09:45.828
I mean, it's not like we're
not into saving the environment.


112
00:09:45.928 --> 00:09:48.580
All's I know is,
I'm not gonna lose my beloved

web-footed, porpoise-prissy punk!


114

Don't worry about it, though. I think
when they see we've gotten off the couch,


115
00:09:57.521 --> 00:10:00.090
- they're gonna go into seizures.
- You think?


116
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.384
Total.

117
00:10:02.484 --> 00:10:05.093
Mm. Check out that mall, man.

- I don't know, but we do!


121
00:10:23.544 --> 00:10:27.864
Um... I don't think there's a kegger
at Vasquez Lake, Doyle.


122
00:10:27.964 --> 00:10:29.866
We've been had, Squirly.

123
00:10:29.966 --> 00:10:33.494
Makes you proud knowing we got
such crafty girlfriends, though.


124
00:10:33.594 --> 00:10:38.040
- We're lucky guys.
- Mm-hm. That's for sure.


125
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.585
- Vasquez Lake?
- More like Vasquez Craphole.


126
00:10:41.685 --> 00:10:44.545
- There used to be fish here, remember?
- Yes, I do, Doyle.


127

A long time ago,

Leave Bud alone, Mom.

129
00:10:49.567 --> 00:10:53.220
I'm teaching Bud how to
hold his breath underwater.


130
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.140
Much better, Bud.
Now let's try for three minutes.

- Those were the days.
- Yeah, I'll say.

Hey! Don't leave that there, Stub.

- Can you cork it?

- OK. Let's go at the mall.

that wanted us to stay.


297
00:23:30.525 --> 00:23:34.971
Think back. "Springboard into the future".
We didn't prepare for this voyage.


298
00:23:35.071 --> 00:23:38.766
We need clean teeth too, all right?
His teeth... Look.


299
00:23:38.866 --> 00:23:41.685
You are absolutely right.

300
00:23:41.785 --> 00:23:45.238
You should be brought up to speed.
It is time for a tour.


301
00:23:46.748 --> 00:23:51.861
Boys. Boys! From here you can see
all the regions of the Bio-Dome:


302
00:23:51.961 --> 00:23:56.991
The rain forest, the tropical lagoon,
the farm, and the great desert.


303
00:23:57.091 --> 00:24:00.410
Every effort was made
to duplicate them precisely,


304
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.085
and all of this is your home now.

305
00:24:06.056 --> 00:24:11.837
But remember, the survival of this system
is dependent upon homeostasis.


306
00:24:11.937 --> 00:24:16.931
That means a balance
within an enclosed system itself.


307
00:24:19.026 --> 00:24:21.386
Faulkner?

308
00:24:21.486 --> 00:24:23.563
Could we get some binoculars?

309
00:24:27.367 --> 00:24:29.435
Let's make a rule:

310
00:24:29.535 --> 00:24:33.606
Everything that you did at home,
you're forbidden to do here.


311
00:24:33.706 --> 00:24:35.149
BOTH: Everything?

312
00:24:35.249 --> 00:24:37.611
Shave poochie-poochie.

313
00:24:38.001 --> 00:24:40.363
Shave poochie-poochie.

314
00:24:47.843 --> 00:24:49.745
- Everything.
- OK.


315
00:24:49.845 --> 00:24:52.005
- All right.
- Don't move.


316
00:24:53.348 --> 00:24:56.042
- I'll be right back.
- I got a wicked itch on my nads.


317
00:24:56.142 --> 00:24:57.887
Don't move!

318
00:25:04.024 --> 00:25:08.053
(WHISPERS) Bud,
I got a wicked itch on my nads.


319
00:25:08.153 --> 00:25:11.356
(WHISPERS) Faulkner said don't move.

320
00:25:13.908 --> 00:25:17.937
I can't take it any more!
I can't take it any more!


321
00:25:18.037 --> 00:25:21.231
Well, I guess this means
we're our own tour guides.


322
00:25:21.331 --> 00:25:25.193
All right. Now, everybody,
do not feed the animals, stay together,


323
00:25:25.293 --> 00:25:27.361
and no flash photography.

324
00:25:27.461 --> 00:25:32.407
Remember, at Bio-Dome we're dependent
on balancing homos within the system.


325
00:25:32.507 --> 00:25:37.419
OK. Now, everybody stay with the group.
Follow me. This way.


326
00:25:38.179 --> 00:25:42.457
- Jerk! You shouldn't have hit me so hard.
- (BUD LAUGHS)


327
00:25:42.557 --> 00:25:45.585
(WHISPERS) No, wait.
Come here, come here.


328
00:25:45.685 --> 00:25:50.964
- Hey! There's no knob here!
- OLIVIA: Oh, God. Here we go.


329
00:25:51.065 --> 00:25:54.176
Olivia, what's with this door?
It's not opening.


330
00:25:54.276 --> 00:25:57.555
Of course it won't open.
It won't open again for an entire year.


331
00:25:57.655 --> 00:26:00.723
Nothing comes in, nothing goes out.
Not even air.


332
00:26:00.823 --> 00:26:04.144
It would take a Sherman tank
to open that door.


333
00:26:04.244 --> 00:26:08.605
- Hmm... So what you're saying is...
- You can't get out.


334
00:26:08.705 --> 00:26:10.899
- We're stuck here.
- For 12 months.


335
00:26:10.999 --> 00:26:13.360
- That's right.
- 12 months?


336
00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.486
- 52 weeks.
- Yes!


337
00:26:15.586 --> 00:26:18.030
Three hundred and eighty-five days?!

338
00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:19.994
Yes. Yes. Yes!

339
00:26:21.384 --> 00:26:25.085
So what you're really trying to say is?

340
00:26:25.762 --> 00:26:27.914
(GROWLS)

341

342
00:26:31.976 --> 00:26:33.878
I'm a Sherman tank!

343
00:26:33.978 --> 00:26:36.470
Sherman tank!

Where did you come from?

350
00:27:03.587 --> 00:27:08.283
My mom and the authorities are still
trying to figure that out, but hey.


351
00:27:08.383 --> 00:27:11.619
- D'you know there's a jungle in here?
- Yes, I do.


352
00:27:11.719 --> 00:27:17.333
Well, whoever thought of putting a jungle
in Arizona is a pretty smart guy.


353
00:27:17.433 --> 00:27:20.138
Woah! Barbarella!

354
00:27:31.445 --> 00:27:34.723
- What are you doin', making smoothies?
- No.


355
00:27:34.823 --> 00:27:37.860
Nature is about miracles, Bud.

356
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:41.188
A goat is a miracle.

357
00:27:42.914 --> 00:27:45.191
A carrot is a miracle.

358
00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:49.367
And you're a miracle too, Petri.

359
00:27:52.379 --> 00:27:54.658
What's up, Doc?

360
00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:58.077
Why are you putting him
in the rice paddy?


361
00:27:58.177 --> 00:28:02.247
Tilapia are an integral part
of our food supply.


362
00:28:02.347 --> 00:28:07.544
- They eat the algae then fertilise the rice.
- So then these... tipatilia,


363
00:28:07.644 --> 00:28:10.129
they're goin' unh-unh on the rice?

364
00:28:10.229 --> 00:28:12.131
"Unh-unh"?

365
00:28:12.231 --> 00:28:16.478
- I mean crappin' on the rice.
- Well, in crude layman's terms, yes.


366
00:28:18.528 --> 00:28:20.430
Does Uncle Ben know about this?

367
00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:22.939
So, um... Hey, I know yoga. Look.

368
00:28:26.451 --> 00:28:32.149
Do it like that. And sometimes
I can lick my back, too. Watch.


369
00:28:32.249 --> 00:28:34.233
Petra!

370
00:28:34.333 --> 00:28:36.736
The tide monitor needs attention.

371
00:28:36.836 --> 00:28:39.071
When I really stretch, I can...

372
00:28:39.171 --> 00:28:42.866
- FAULKNER: Thank you.
- Hey, wait! Don't go anywhere.


373
00:28:42.966 --> 00:28:46.411
Maybe I'll show you
some other manoeuvres later.


374
00:28:46.511 --> 00:28:49.913
- Ow! God, my sciatic.
- Squirly, Squirly! You gotta come quick.


375
00:28:50.013 --> 00:28:52.082
You gotta come see this.

376
00:28:52.182 --> 00:28:55.090
- Your sciatic? It's bad?
- Hit it!


377
00:28:56.894 --> 00:28:59.849
Ohh! You should have seen
what she did with a carrot!


378
00:29:01.649 --> 00:29:06.178
Russell, there's beer cans in the trash in
the kitchen, in the trash in the bathroom,


379
00:29:06.278 --> 00:29:08.346
and in the trash in the basement.

380
00:29:08.446 --> 00:29:11.892
- What does that say?
- We're out of beer?


381
00:29:11.992 --> 00:29:14.518
Mom, please tell your love slave

382
00:29:14.618 --> 00:29:18.230
that if he's not part of the solution,
he's part of the problem.


383
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.441
The only problem I have
is that I've run out of Depends.


384
00:29:21.541 --> 00:29:24.611
Russell, there is a bathroom
right around the corner.


385
00:29:24.711 --> 00:29:29.788
I cannot go to the bathroom.
I hurt my bladder rollerblading.


386
00:29:35.012 --> 00:29:39.207
Hey, look at that. There's that guy Bob
I chased out of here the other day.


387
00:29:39.307 --> 00:29:41.626
Bud?!

388
00:29:41.726 --> 00:29:45.212
- (PHONE)
- TV: Earth Day to Earth Day.


389
00:29:45.312 --> 00:29:49.049
- That's a long time to be locked away...
- They're on TV! (SCREAMS)


390
00:29:49.149 --> 00:29:52.721
- Can you believe it?!
- ... this is Joachim West reporting.


391
00:29:53.777 --> 00:29:57.932
I told you we were into nurturing
Mother Earth, but you didn't believe us.


392
00:29:58.032 --> 00:30:03.978
Now you guys are thinking locally,
and we're acting globally!


393
00:30:04.078 --> 00:30:05.980
- Just get out of there.
- We can't.


394
00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.441
We signed up. We're part of the few.

395
00:30:08.541 --> 00:30:13.278
- Part of the problem!
- It's an important biological experiment.


396
00:30:13.378 --> 00:30:16.532
- You'll ruin everything.
- Maybe you're not aware of it,


397
00:30:16.632 --> 00:30:19.158
but we're a vital part
of the homeosystem.


398
00:30:19.258 --> 00:30:23.287
Don't you think your couch
is having withdrawals?


399
00:30:23.387 --> 00:30:26.790
So what are we supposed to do?
Wait a year for you guys to get out?


400
00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:32.170
Mo-Mo and Porkchop, there comes
a time in life when we must sacrifice


401
00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:36.549
what is most dear to us
for the greater good of saving the world,


402
00:30:36.649 --> 00:30:38.968
and now is that time.

403
00:30:39.068 --> 00:30:43.096
- Is that how you really feel?
- No. This is how I really feel.


404
00:30:43.196 --> 00:30:45.890
Budly! There's people around.

405
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:47.851
I know. I miss you.

406
00:30:47.951 --> 00:30:49.768
I'm proud of you.

407
00:30:49.868 --> 00:30:52.277
So I guess this is goodbye.

408
00:30:52.871 --> 00:30:54.948
I guess.

409
00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:10.001
COMPUTER: Attention. 
Dinner is served.

410
00:31:10.554 --> 00:31:13.675
Well... We gotta go. Bye.

411
00:31:15.057 --> 00:31:17.134
Bye.

412
00:31:25.733 --> 00:31:27.929
Day one in the books.

413
00:31:30.529 --> 00:31:32.891
Cheers, mate.

414
00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:47.121
- What's with this Kibble?
- Are you guys trying to poison us?


415
00:31:47.627 --> 00:31:51.281
- You don't like soy casserole?
- It tastes like it came out of Romulus.


416
00:31:51.381 --> 00:31:53.158
Maybe it did.

417
00:31:53.258 --> 00:31:57.411
Soy is our principal source of protein.
You'll learn to love it.


418
00:31:57.511 --> 00:32:03.166
Could you at least make it taste
like chicken? A bouillon base, paprika...


419
00:32:03.266 --> 00:32:07.962
Spice it up a little? Otherwise
I'm gonna shrivel up like a supermodel.


420
00:32:08.062 --> 00:32:11.298
- I am so fat!
- No, you're not.


421
00:32:11.398 --> 00:32:14.051
- Nobody likes me.
- You're beautiful.


422
00:32:14.151 --> 00:32:18.055
- People didn't like me in high school.
- Everybody loves you.


423
00:32:18.155 --> 00:32:21.891
Oh, thank you! 
You're so sweet, Naomi.

424
00:32:21.991 --> 00:32:24.946
Avez-vous une cigarette?

425
00:32:31.541 --> 00:32:34.116
Squirly, are you asleep, man?

426
00:32:36.545 --> 00:32:38.622
Squirl!

427
00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:43.118
Are you sleepin'?

428
00:32:43.218 --> 00:32:46.579
- What'd you have to hit me for?
- I can't sleep.


429
00:32:46.679 --> 00:32:48.206
Oh...

430
00:32:48.306 --> 00:32:52.000
Hey, just think back
to those sleepovers we used to have.


431
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.170
If you think back,
then maybe you'll be able to sleep.


432
00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.347
- OK.
- OK.


433
00:32:59.107 --> 00:33:03.473
(BUD HOWLS) What's up, buddy?
Cos I'm the weasel.


434
00:33:04.529 --> 00:33:06.472
OK, my turn.

Peanut butter and jelly with bacon.
That's easy.


438
00:33:22.169 --> 00:33:27.323
Good call, man! Keep on cruisin'.
Keep on goin'.


439
00:33:27.423 --> 00:33:29.786
Keep on goin' down the line.

Mixed green salad with 1000...
blue cheese dressing.

Rad, dude! That was fully major.
Your beaker always knows, buddy.


442
00:33:41.477 --> 00:33:46.466
Keep on cruisin'. Come on, buddy.
It's OK. Keep on cruisin'.


443
00:33:46.566 --> 00:33:48.725
Wait. It's over here now.

Yo, Mone. Check it out. Your friends
Bob and Darryl are gettin' tail.


445
00:34:07.542 --> 00:34:10.331
- Assholes!
- If I were you, Mone,


446
00:34:10.587 --> 00:34:13.989
I'd go out and
hump for the next year.

447
00:34:14.089 --> 00:34:16.450
If I were you, Russ,

448
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:19.953
I'd have my mouth full of shotgun
with my toe on the trigger.


449
00:34:20.053 --> 00:34:24.087
It's frightening how much you want me.

450
00:34:27.518 --> 00:34:30.224
Stubby! "Thriving on Chaos"!

451
00:34:31.938 --> 00:34:35.890
Those'll sell better
than Iron Maiden merch.


452
00:34:37.234 --> 00:34:40.721
Let's hope so. I just want
you gentlemen to remember


453
00:34:40.821 --> 00:34:44.849
how important you are
to this whole experiment.


454
00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:50.563
Feel free to contribute. You are
an integral part of the Bio-Dome system.


455
00:34:50.663 --> 00:34:52.940
Um... Since you put it that way,

456
00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.568
we were thinking of you producing
maybe environmental condoms,


457
00:34:56.668 --> 00:35:01.572
so when you... rip the packet,
it's automatic sap lubrication.


458
00:35:01.672 --> 00:35:07.161
No chalk on the bark. And then
when you're pollinating your flower...


459
00:35:07.261 --> 00:35:10.914
Slide, slide, slipperty-slide.
Just smooth.


460
00:35:11.014 --> 00:35:14.501
- Right in.
- And the Bud and Doyle action figures.


461
00:35:14.601 --> 00:35:19.014
- Action figures.
- Anatomically correct, of course.


462
00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:29.973
And last but not least,

463
00:35:30.073 --> 00:35:31.687
Watch this.

464
00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:39.773
- HUSKY: Hi, I'm Doyle.
- And I'm Bud.


465
00:35:39.873 --> 00:35:43.026
And when we're not out
saving the environment,


466
00:35:43.126 --> 00:35:48.239
we're thinking of you, naked,
thigh-deep in tofu.


467
00:35:52.467 --> 00:35:54.829
You likey, Leaky?

468
00:35:56.263 --> 00:36:01.673
BUD: Our home is the Garden of Eden!

469
00:36:01.976 --> 00:36:05.712
More like the Garden of Boredom,
and I'm chairman of the bored.


470
00:36:05.812 --> 00:36:08.465
Come on, Stub. 
We can have our own fun.

471
00:36:08.565 --> 00:36:11.768
Remember the time the Magnavox
went out? What did we do?


472
00:36:14.445 --> 00:36:20.309
Fly, Mary Poppins!
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!


473
00:36:20.409 --> 00:36:22.685
Can we do it again, Squirly?

474
00:36:22.785 --> 00:36:26.105
- Those were the days.
- Cheer up, buckaroo.


475
00:36:26.205 --> 00:36:29.941
Just cos we're stuck in a bubble
doesn't mean we can't cause any trouble.


476
00:36:30.041 --> 00:36:32.402
We're the everlasting force

477
00:36:32.502 --> 00:36:36.573
of Squirly!

478
00:36:36.673 --> 00:36:38.251
Stubby!

479
00:36:41.218 --> 00:36:45.170
You ready? Hut one, hut two,
hut, hut, hike!


480
00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:50.377
- Let me through!
- No!


481
00:36:50.477 --> 00:36:53.051
- Come on, let me through.
- No!


482
00:36:57.733 --> 00:37:00.678
- Neon Deion!
- No fair!


483
00:37:00.778 --> 00:37:03.137
- No fair! Personal foul!
- You want some of me?


484
00:37:03.237 --> 00:37:07.433
I told you
you shouldn't have had some of me.


485
00:37:07.533 --> 00:37:09.812
Squirly!

486
00:37:10.869 --> 00:37:12.945
Fish on the play!

487
00:37:13.789 --> 00:37:16.942
My proposal
is that we plant these seeds.


488
00:37:17.042 --> 00:37:20.736
And I know you're thinkin'
"Illegal! Illegal!"


489
00:37:20.836 --> 00:37:26.158
But the value of purple sticky punge
goes way beyond just tokin' it.


490
00:37:26.258 --> 00:37:33.709
- Ain't that right, Professor Johnson?
- That's correct, Professor MacIntosh.


491
00:37:34.765 --> 00:37:39.962
"Purple sticky punge, or hemp,
is an excellent source of paper."


492
00:37:40.062 --> 00:37:42.089
"It makes a fine rope."

493
00:37:42.189 --> 00:37:45.883
"It can even make
a contaminant-free fuel."


494
00:37:45.983 --> 00:37:53.473
"But the greatest value to us Bio-Domers
is its rapid rate of photosyninthesis,


495
00:37:53.573 --> 00:37:57.560
which means more oxygen for everyone."

496
00:37:59.745 --> 00:38:02.190
BOTH: On three... Three!

497
00:38:16.051 --> 00:38:18.128
Cannonball!

498
00:38:23.891 --> 00:38:26.044
- There you go, Mr Bloom.
- Thanks, girls.


499
00:38:26.144 --> 00:38:29.213
Tell Bud and Doyle
I'm writin' a song about them, OK?


500
00:38:29.313 --> 00:38:31.506
Cool!

501
00:38:31.606 --> 00:38:33.387
- Mone!
- JEN: Oh, God.


502
00:38:34.443 --> 00:38:37.721
Check it out. This is the event
you've been waiting for.


503
00:38:37.821 --> 00:38:43.225
The Annual at Arizona Tech, a three-day
blowout to benefit the rain forest.


504
00:38:43.325 --> 00:38:48.604
There's gonna be, like, seminars
and lectures, and kegs and dudes galore.


505
00:38:48.705 --> 00:38:51.483
- Monique, we cannot go to this.
- Why not, pray tell?


506
00:38:51.583 --> 00:38:55.568
- Do the names Bud and Doyle ring a bell?
- A year's a long time to wait.


507
00:38:55.669 --> 00:38:58.781
- Do you know how old we'll be in a year?
- Old.


508
00:38:58.881 --> 00:39:01.825
- Real old.
- As in not spring chickens, over the hill...


509
00:39:01.925 --> 00:39:03.327
OK, OK, OK!

510
00:39:03.427 --> 00:39:07.080
Plus, did you see the pictures
of the chicks they're in there with?


511
00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:11.166
- They're hot.
- So? I trust Doyle.


512
00:39:11.267 --> 00:39:14.044
Listen, I love Bud
just as much as you love Doyle.


513
00:39:14.144 --> 00:39:18.642
But we gotta start thinking
about ourselves. They are.


514
00:39:19.524 --> 00:39:21.268
Oh... OK.

515
00:39:24.403 --> 00:39:29.813
- Now, pay attention, Soave Bolla.
- You're king, I'm peasant.


516
00:39:35.413 --> 00:39:37.774
Good afternoon, Petri dish.

517
00:39:38.624 --> 00:39:41.151
May-may.

518
00:39:41.251 --> 00:39:45.196
Perhaps you'd like to join us
for a little apéritif on the ridge.


519
00:39:45.296 --> 00:39:49.575
Allow me to present...
Chateau Squirly Stub.


520
00:39:49.675 --> 00:39:53.370
It's a bit plucky, a bit fruity perhaps,

521
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:56.957
but it'll satisfy your palate,
especially with a big piece of pork.


522
00:39:57.057 --> 00:39:59.667
So that's what happened
to our fruit harvest?


523
00:39:59.768 --> 00:40:02.046
You're incorrigible.

524
00:40:03.771 --> 00:40:05.881
- I think they're into us.
- In a huge way.


525
00:40:05.981 --> 00:40:08.058
Mini tribal.

526
00:40:10.777 --> 00:40:12.853
- Marco!
- Cholo!


527
00:40:14.697 --> 00:40:16.773
- Marco!
- Cholo!


528
00:40:17.783 --> 00:40:20.690
Look. Biodegradable pineapple.

529
00:40:21.954 --> 00:40:25.648
Olivia, Romuli. Why don't you guys
join us for a little soak?


530
00:40:25.748 --> 00:40:29.569
That's not for bathing.
This is the artificial rain generator.


531
00:40:31.879 --> 00:40:35.449
- (FARTS)
- Whoo! It just got a little warmer.


532
00:40:35.549 --> 00:40:40.120
- There's nothing artificial about that.
- A little acid rain.


533
00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:45.458
They dominate a number of pivotal
processes occurring in the soil,


534
00:40:45.558 --> 00:40:47.960
and that's what makes this so exciting.

535
00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:51.921
Ladies and gentlemen,
here are Bud and Doyle.


536
00:40:52.021 --> 00:40:55.759
Doyle! What's the hot gossip
on the inside?


537
00:40:57.818 --> 00:41:00.554
I can't make any comment at this time,

538
00:41:00.654 --> 00:41:05.308
but all I know is, if I see one more
massive orgy, I'm movin' to Tibet.


539
00:41:05.408 --> 00:41:09.063
And Faulkner? Quit hogging the KY!

540
00:41:09.412 --> 00:41:11.230
Thirty-one,

541
00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:13.904
forty-two, sixty-nine,

542
00:41:14.958 --> 00:41:17.035
seventy-four...

543
00:41:21.756 --> 00:41:24.118
A hundred... a thousand!

544
00:41:24.967 --> 00:41:26.795
Here I come!

545
00:41:30.513 --> 00:41:32.832
Rombo! You gotta hide me.

546
00:41:32.932 --> 00:41:36.044
Not in here! You'll upset my bugs.

547
00:41:36.144 --> 00:41:37.343
Look out! It's...

548
00:41:39.313 --> 00:41:41.382
May I help you?

549
00:41:41.482 --> 00:41:44.259
- What are these guys?
- Well...


550
00:41:44.359 --> 00:41:47.515
They're two of the rarest
lepidoptera in the world.


551
00:41:47.945 --> 00:41:51.067
Leppard?
Didn't their drummer lose an arm?


552
00:41:52.784 --> 00:41:56.144
No. They're butterflies
from the Brazilian rain forest.


553
00:41:56.244 --> 00:41:58.814
So are you tryin'
to get 'em to start porking?


554
00:41:58.914 --> 00:42:03.776
Actually, yes. In nature, the chances
of these two finding each other,


555
00:42:03.876 --> 00:42:06.362
or "porking",

556
00:42:06.462 --> 00:42:08.906
are very remote.

557
00:42:09.006 --> 00:42:11.996
We hope to breed thousands here.

558
00:42:12.467 --> 00:42:13.619
Easy, Rombo.

559
00:42:14.302 --> 00:42:16.877
- Got ya!
- You gotta take me first!


560
00:42:32.318 --> 00:42:36.555
BOTH: Mothra! Come back, Mothra!
Please come back, Mothra!


561
00:42:36.655 --> 00:42:39.527
Lepidoptera!

562
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:42.518
- Monique, should we be doing this?
- Yes!


563
00:42:42.618 --> 00:42:47.531
Jen, we are not doing anything wrong.
Besides, it's to save the rain forest.


564
00:42:52.293 --> 00:42:54.904
- Denise.
- Roach.


565
00:42:55.004 --> 00:42:57.081
One word: Raid.

566
00:43:02.386 --> 00:43:03.412
Hey, man.

567
00:43:03.512 --> 00:43:08.625
She thinks she's cool cos she hangs out
with Bud and Doyle's girlfriends.


568
00:43:08.725 --> 00:43:12.253
- She digs me, though.
- Are those Bud and Doyle's girlfriends?


569
00:43:12.353 --> 00:43:14.465
- Yeah.
- Put that back.


570
00:43:16.857 --> 00:43:19.593
Excuse me. Are you guys
done with those beers?


571
00:43:19.693 --> 00:43:23.554
Thanks, but we're having
too much fun sober.


572
00:43:23.654 --> 00:43:27.808
We were just going around
trying to collect empties and recycle 'em.


573
00:43:27.908 --> 00:43:30.435
- Oh! Well, here, take this.
- Take mine.


574
00:43:30.535 --> 00:43:35.273
- There's a lot of waste at these parties.
- That's awfully noble of you.


575
00:43:35.373 --> 00:43:37.734
It's just what we're compelled to do.

576
00:43:37.834 --> 00:43:42.821
We're having a fête to save the rain forest.
If you guys'd like to show your support...


577
00:43:42.921 --> 00:43:46.533
- It's not gonna be like this, is it?
- Not at all.


578
00:43:46.633 --> 00:43:49.577
- It's gonna be decent.
- It's at the quad.


579
00:43:49.677 --> 00:43:53.794
OK, we'll be there.
We'll see you tomorrow. Thanks.


580
00:43:56.266 --> 00:43:59.211
Noah, it's been a nonstop moronathon,

581
00:43:59.311 --> 00:44:04.131
and I did not dedicate my life to science
to baby-sit a couple of baboons.


582
00:44:04.231 --> 00:44:09.220
They eat like savages. At the rate
they're going, we'll run out of foodstuffs.


583
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:12.973
They're going to ruin everything.

584
00:44:13.073 --> 00:44:16.101
- (GOAT BLEATS)
- Sliced it!


585
00:44:16.201 --> 00:44:19.019
Damn it, Billy.
Damn it, damn it, damn it.


586
00:44:19.119 --> 00:44:24.525
How am I supposed to hit a double birdie
with my bogey billy with a shower iron?!


587
00:44:24.625 --> 00:44:28.403
You're embarrassing me
in front of my friends!


588
00:44:28.503 --> 00:44:32.324
- Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.
- Come on, Billy.


589
00:44:35.801 --> 00:44:37.877
Anatomically correct.

590
00:44:47.353 --> 00:44:50.047
Are you sure this flypaper's gonna work?

591

All I can say right now
is that we're still negotiating.


922
01:10:07.227 --> 01:10:12.714
We're trying to keep them aware of the
dangerously low level of oxygen inside.

926

Doyle and I call "the beer-can effect".

That should increase the moisture
inside here and bring on a downpour.
