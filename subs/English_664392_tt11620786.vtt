00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.700
Ciao Felipe.

2
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.300
Company car?

3
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.340
No, GT. Old and limited.

4
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.180
Good to see you.

5
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.140
Nice choice of wheels. Classic.

6
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.580
Hi, MichÃ¨le.

7
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.980
Hello! How are you?
Nice to see you.


8
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.116
Nice to see you. You need
help with the bags?


9
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.420
Tom.

10
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.860
Not yet.

11
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.140
Hey Mika!

12
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.460
- Hi!
- Great to see you.


13
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.860
Hey, Mika.

14
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.220
Long time.

15
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.059
It was a nice journey to come here.

16
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.980
- Yeah. Good.
- Beautiful English weather.


17
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.380
Like always.

18
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.580
Im from a very humble background
in that sense of


19
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.140
my father could not afford to
support me in karting.


20
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.260
Im home born
on a gas station.


21
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.940
And my dad
was racing cars, touring cars...


22
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.380
Ford Escort, M1s, both on asphalt
and off road.


23
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.660
So, when I was wearing nappies
I was taken to races and watching.


24
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.900
So, its kind of in my blood.

25
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.740
And then sometimes I was driving
the kart around the gas station


26
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.700
when people were coming in
for refuelling.


27
00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.660
For me it was completely different

28
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.780
because my surroundings
were not at all motorsport.


29
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.540
Youre not born
in a gas station like me?


30
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.956
No, not at all. I was born
in the fields of rose and jasmine.


31
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.300
So, its completely different.

32
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.980
My family was growing flowers
for the perfume in Grasse,


33
00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.180
which is the capital of perfume.

34
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.180
I started driving by myself.

35
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.900
I was 14.

36
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.860
Just because, you know,
it was fun,


37
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.180
I wanted to... I was a young girl,
very active, very sportive


38
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.340
and ready for any adventures,

39
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.820
so, I wanted to move the car,
I dont know why.


40
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.820
So one day I took
my fathers Citroen 2CV,


41
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.059
you know, the small car.

42
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.100
And with a friend I said we have
to move the car.


43
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.420
So, I started to drive.

44
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.740
And my father saw the car passing
through the kitchen window.


45
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.956
And he said, Somebody is stealing my
car or what?


46
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.340
And then he realized it was me.

47
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.500
For me, a car was independence,
freedom, moving around,


48
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.220
going travelling,
but nothing to do with motorsport.


49
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.820
Motorsport arrived
in my life when I was 21.


50
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.700
And you?

51
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.580
My father gave me a little motocross
when I was 6 years old.


52
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.900
And I was asking him,
I want to race, I want to race.


53
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.980
And then he was a little bit afraid,
because I was starting to jump.


54
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.460
I was starting to, you know,
to get some scrapes.


55
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.500
So, then he said,

56
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.820
I think its better four wheels
than two wheels,


57
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.620
so, when I was eight years old,

58
00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.100
he brought me to, like.
A little karting school.


59
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.540
Whats your name?

60
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.420
- Felipe.
- Felipe who?


61
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.500
Massa.

62
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.460
I remember when I drove
that day, I was like, in love.


63
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.180
And, its unbelievable because
when I started racing, I knew,


64
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.100
this is what I want to do.

65
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.420
I was never thinking
about other things.


66
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.820
I grew up in Interlagos,
near the race track,


67
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.020
watching all the races in the past,
in the grandstand.


68
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.740
At the time, Senna was
like a God in Brazil, you know.


69
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.180
Three times World Champion.

70
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.860
No one could even dream to follow him.

71
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.300
Yes, well I started motor racing,
I think,


72
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.020
I was around six.
Six years old in karting.


73
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.260
And of course, as a kid,
you want to go flat out.


74
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.500
You like the speed.

75
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.140
But it didnt start really well.

76
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.700
You know, the very first time when I
went to a go-kart track...


77
00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:39.459
The place was called Keimola.
A very beautiful track.


78
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:44.220
Then I sat in a go-kart and said,
This is going to be fun.


79
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.660
And of course, 
I went flat out.

80
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.700
You know, full gas immediately.
And I turned in too early.


81
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.780
And I touched the tire.

82
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.820
And of course,
the whole go-kart went...


83
00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.620
- Really...
- Upside down.


84
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.660
And Im lying there, you know,
six year old kid


85
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.020
and I can see upside-down

86
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.660
and my parents are running flat out.

87
00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.340
Oh my God! Our dear son is dead!

88
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.980
And of course, my parents
were shocked.


89
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.460
I remember their faces. They were
like Oh my God!


90
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.140
And it was, actually it was good,
what happened,


91
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.980
because I immediately realized
that way,


92
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.380
you know,
this is a dangerous sport.


93
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.660
Another driver, who isnt
racing for Germany


94
00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.100
although he is German
and is even the favorite,


95
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.100
here at the Kerpen track
is Michael Schumacher.


96
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.740
Youre racing for Luxembourg.
Why?


97
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.220
Because Germany requires qualifying
races, which cost money.


98
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.620
And if we get eliminated,

99
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.756
then we wont qualify to race
in the World Championship.


100
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.500
But were the only one
racing for Luxembourg.


101
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.340
It doesnt cost any money
and weve automatically qualified.


102
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.820
And who told you all this?

103
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.780
My sponsor.

104
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.860
I remember seeing you in Denmark
when we started in karting.


105
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.420
I remember it was... I have the
picture... its in Ribe.


106
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:47.460
And I remember this white,
or it was white once, I guess.


107
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.700
Your leather suit.
It was kind of oily...


108
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.596
The weather wasn't so good either,
I don't think.


109
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.900
It was white with blue stripes...
Blue stripes, yeah.


110
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.380
So, you guys raced together?

111
00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.260
Yeah, we did.

112
00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.500
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


113
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.020
And I remember taking notice that

114
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.540
hey, we have to watch out
for this guy.


115
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.940
At the front, the Dane,
Tom Kristensen,


116
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.740
winner of the semifinal,

117
00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.860
with Mike HÃokkinen
lining up second.


118
00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.940
I remember that.
It was Formula Nordic, I think.


119
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.916
- Yeah. Its true.
- The junior category.


120
00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.060
Yeah, I remember that one.

121
00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.540
We did many races there,
where actually we touched.


122
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.876
So maybe we shouldnt
touch on that one.


123
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.780
Yes but its okay!

124
00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.460
But the racing was good.
And any of us could have won.


125
00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.980
Because I literally think we changed
position eight times in the final.


126
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.540
And we were really, really close.

127
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.900
But this guy doesnt
give up, I tell you.


128
00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.260
End of '72, I started to do
Monte Carlo as a co-driver.


129
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.580
My father loved rallies, loved cars,
so what he couldnt do,


130
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.100
he offered to me. He said,
I know you like to drive.


131
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.860
To see you in the passengers seat,
you know, I dont like it.


132
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.220
Why dont you drive?

133
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.900
I said, Okay, but what I will do?

134
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.020
He said, Okay, 
I will buy you a car.

135
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.580
I will pay for good conditions
for one year.


136
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.620
And if you are good enough,
you will continue.


137
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.900
If not, you will stop.

138
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.060
I said, Okay, I will try
to show you that I can.


139
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:30.100
Right. And full power to the left.
Right 85. Narrows in again.


140
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.596
- Alright.
- You can hear the wind.


141
00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.260
Yes, its windy outside.

142
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.580
What a conquest.

143
00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:05.340
Okay... One more.
No need. That looks bad.


144
00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.100
Hey, thank you very much,
you give...


145
00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.180
And you?

146
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.140
- Over.
- Im out.


147
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.660
- 19.
- 19.


148
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.740
25 is more, no?

149
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.300
I joined, in 1990,
West Surrey Racing.


150
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.900
- Dick Bennetts.
- Dick Bennetts, yeah.


151
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.220
It was a very good year, indeed.

152
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.060
You know,
winning a British championship.


153
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.060
At the end of the year
there is a race,


154
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.460
the F3 race in Macau,

155
00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.380
where all the top drivers come
from around the world.


156
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.740
Everything went perfectly.
You know, all the practice,


157
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.980
Im quite pleased because my pole
position is nearly one second


158
00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.060
in front of Michael Schumacher.

159
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.540
His time is really fantastic,
but it is not impossible.


160
00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.180
There are two races.

161
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.180
So, I won the first race,
everything went perfectly.


162
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.140
So, I won the first race
by about two seconds.


163
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.300
I was leading in the second race

164
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.940
and I made a mistake
or something.


165
00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.556
- Why are you always turning right...
- I dont know!


166
00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.340
- And never left?
- Because it feels natural!


167
00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.436
Because its a way to remember!

168
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.780
So, Michael was able to overtake me.

169
00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.980
So, if I would had finished behind
him just inside of two seconds,


170
00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.940
I would have won overall
the whole race, so...


171
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.380
So there is like one or two laps
to go and Michael is leading,


172
00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.020
and he made a big mistake

173
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.780
in a really high-speed
right-hand corner


174
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:02.540
and I thought, What I can do?
I have to overtake him.


175
00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.700
He was so slow, so I really
got close to him.


176
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.260
Catching a tow.

177
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.316
And you know,
going to overtake, and I could just...


178
00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.500
And I could see his eyes
in the mirror looking...


179
00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.620
I knew I see him in my mirrors

180
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:38.500
and then when I see him
right behind he closes up on me.


181
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.980
And then he goes off the gas
and he stays behind me.


182
00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.820
And in this time, he closed up,
he closed up, and I see it,


183
00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.140
and I go to the right side.

184
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.636
In this moment,
he wanted to overtake me


185
00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.980
and hes so quick, in this moment,
that he couldnt brake.


186
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.540
Lost the whole race.
Terrible moment.


187
00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:12.380
Then in 1991 I joined
Formula 1. Team Lotus.


188
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:16.460
Team Lotus, Peter Collins,
signed me to race there.


189
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.940
- Then the hard work started.
- Then it started.


190
00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.340
Schumacher was available
this weekend,


191
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.140
he had no other commitments.

192
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.060
Ive seen him in Formula 3

193
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.180
or the team has this attitude
to give youth a chance


194
00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.060
We think its a progressive way

195
00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.260
to see what the potential
of Schumacher is for the future.


196
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:53.100
Im really happy. With this car you
can do this qualifying time.


197
00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:59.100
You know, the car feels really good
and its a lot of fun to drive.


198
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.940
And also for the time,
Im really happy.


199
00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:21.060
Im convinced, and my lawyers
have advised me,


200
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:26.219
that we have two signed legal
agreements with Michael Schumacher.


201
00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.380
There was some points where
Eddie and me cant agree.


202
00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.900
Or I cant agree with Eddie,
let me say it like this.


203
00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.260
And I cant accept this.

204
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:38.020
I wouldnt sign a contract
which was not good for me.


205
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.580
And I got a contract from Benetton
which was good for me.


206
00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.620
It was really interesting
to follow people


207
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.380
who have competed within karting,

208
00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:52.220
including this man,
progressing in motorsport.


209
00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.580
I was racing but it was tough times.

210
00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.780
I got a chance at Brno,
with an older car.


211
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.780
Michael was at that race
and his career was on fire.


212
00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.980
From Denmark we really...
there was nobody,


213
00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.740
there was no foundation to help
for us Danish drivers.


214
00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:11.940
It was basically three years

215
00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:16.460
where I managed to get a job
at my first application.


216
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.180
As a bank clerk.

217
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.900
At one time, they asked me
in the middle of the summer


218
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.940
if I had a truck license.

219
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.380
And I said, Yes of course.
Im a driver.


220
00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.836
And then I was driving the bank bus

221
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.780
for some time,
around in small cities.


222
00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:38.100
So, it wasnt until the beginning
of 1991,


223
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.940
I got the call from an F3 team
in Germany.


224
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.860
And I won the championship.

225
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.220
And then in the last race,
in Hockenheim,


226
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.620
I beat your lap record
of the year before.


227
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.340
Of course, my car was more
sophisticated, more developed.


228
00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.500
- No, but it meant so much to me...
- Of course! No, of course.


229
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.116
Hey, come on, you guys
are racing in Formula 1...


230
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.396
Yes, Yes, Yes. 
I fully understand.

231
00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.140
So, I had to find anything I could,

232
00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.980
- any little proof I could...
- Yes.


233
00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.740
That at least I had
a little bit of talent!


234
00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.100
Tom Kristensen, whats going
to happen next?


235
00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.020
The future, what does it hold?

236
00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.980
Its going to be really, really hard.

237
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:28.420
Im Danish and in Denmark motorsport
isnt a very big thing.


238
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.300
Ive spoken to a lot of people
but, up until now,


239
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:35.780
there havent been any solid
offers from sponsors.


240
00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.820
And I went to Japan.

241
00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.340
I spent five years in Japan,
driving different things.


242
00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:59.500
- No. One more. 22.
- Yeah.


243
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.700
- So...
- Over.


244
00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.060
My father was very important

245
00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.500
because he was helping me to find
the money to go to Europe.


246
00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.540
Then I won the Italian and European
Championships on the same year.


247
00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.780
So then, I had many people trying
to get me under contract.


248
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:21.820
And this guy organized a meeting
for me in Maranello with Ferrari.


249
00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.300
And I didnt know,

250
00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:28.100
but they were watching
everything that I was doing,


251
00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:31.780
testing, telemetry, racing...
everything!


252
00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.860
And then they said, Okay,
what we're going to do is that


253
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.100
we will sign a contract with you,
as a young driver for Ferrari.


254
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.820
That had never happened before.

255
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.420
But you cannot tell anybody.
So, it needs to be secret.


256
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:50.820
So, then I signed a contract for
eight years with Ferrari


257
00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.316
and I couldnt say, I mean, I signed
the contract with Ferrari,


258
00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.580
and I could not tell anybody!

259
00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.340
Only my family.
That was really hard.


260
00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.420
Frustrating.

261
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.420
And then I race with Sauber...

262
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.420
Ferrari engines...

263
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.500
Ferrari engines.

264
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.860
And then I had this call
saying that Ferrari took the decision


265
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.820
and I was the driver
that they decided on.


266
00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.820
So I raced 2006 for Ferrari.

267
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.740
And for me it was like
a dream come true.


268
00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:17.020
Im really, really happy
and ready for this challenge.


269
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:43.180
For me, when I finished my amateur
time with Alpine-Renault,


270
00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.940
I got a phone call from Fiat France

271
00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:52.540
and I did three years with them.
I was a full-time Works Driver.


272
00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:56.820
- Did Jean Todt co-pilot for you?
- We were in the same period.


273
00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.316
- Okay.
- Yeah. But he was co-driving,


274
00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.940
- not in the same car.
- Not with me, no.


275
00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.780
No no, he was with the top driver
at that time.


276
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.780
And then before the end
of the season,


277
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.500
I got another phone call.

278
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.740
But this one was a little
bit different.


279
00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.980
First, they were talking in English

280
00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.700
and, of course,
my English was zero.


281
00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.260
I understood¦ "Audi."

282
00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.260
I understood the German accent.

283
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.500
I understood "four-wheel drive."

284
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.220
Yes, because, Quattro.

285
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.300
And I understood
"World Championship."


286
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.940
AUDI FACTORY
Ingolstadt, Germany, 1980


287
00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.460
And I said yes. I said
yes, immediately. Yes.


288
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:35.100
Yes, yes! And so, they invited
me to Ingolstadt.


289
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.580
I remember that they proposed me
to drive with Hannu Mikkolawho was...


290
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.380
first driver.

291
00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:52.300
And I didnt ask for money
or anything.


292
00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.020
I just said yes and I signed.

293
00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.220
It was fantastic.

294
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.100
- I can go fast?
- Yes!


295
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.540
I had come back from Japan
and I was driving in Formula 3000


296
00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:23.780
and I was leading the championship.
And I got the phone call.


297
00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:27.180
It was Ralf JÃ¼ttner from Germany.

298
00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.620
And he represented Joest Racing,

299
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:35.540
and he said, Tom. Its Wednesday
evening, can I talk to you?


300
00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.340
Le Mans is the following weekend
and we are entering a car


301
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.580
and we are going down
there in a few days.


302
00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.620
Friday morning, I flew
down to Wald-Michelbach


303
00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.860
and entered Joest Racing.

304
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.540
And the car that they entered

305
00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.900
was for Michele Alboreto
and Stefan Johansson.


306
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.300
And the team had just
left for Le Mans.


307
00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.116
And then over in the corner
there was a monocoque,


308
00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:01.420
and there was one mechanic,
he was sweeping the floor.


309
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:05.140
So, I jumped up and sat down
in the seat.


310
00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.420
And I heard them speaking German

311
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:11.300
that it was the seat from Michele,
from the test they had done.


312
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:12.820
And hearing that I said,

313
00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.460
Maybe if you could
put the brake pedal a little bit back,


314
00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.700
then for me it would be perfect.

315
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.420
The mechanic, JÃ¼rgen, an old guy,

316
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.940
he puts his face down close to me,
pretending to whisper,


317
00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.780
and then he says very loud,
he said:


318
00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.020
Hey! In our team,
der schnellste bestimmt!"


319
00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.060
"The fastest decides in our team."
And I was a little bit, alright,


320
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.220
I better sign the contract fast.
Thats pretty rough!


321
00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.860
But Le Mans is much more
than the race.


322
00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:49.700
Both Stefan and Michele were great,
but, particularly Michele


323
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.820
as he knew both the race
and the car a bit more.


324
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.700
He was never telling me what to do,

325
00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:58.660
even though I came with no experience
of Le Mans or the car.


326
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.420
I was pretty nervous getting
into the car, initially.


327
00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:24.460
In my third stint, it was even
starting to get into the sunset


328
00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.860
and the sun was in your eyes.

329
00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.900
When I was driving at night,

330
00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.860
it was close to 3 a.m.,

331
00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.196
and I knew that
was gonna be the key,


332
00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:36.380
it just hit me at that moment
and I understood I was on a team


333
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:40.180
which had a chance of fighting
for the podium.


334
00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.460
Lap times were getting better.

335
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:48.876
Tom Kristensen did four stints
in a row


336
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.380
and hes still blasting times here.

337
00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.820
I kept going and suddenly
on the radio,


338
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.180
Ralf JÃ¼ttner, the team manager,

339
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.500
came on and he said: Schnellste
Runde. Schnellste Runde, Tom.


340
00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.340
It means, "fastest lap."

341
00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.500
A lap later he said,

342
00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.980
Lap record! Lap record!

343
00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.100
Keep it steady young man!
Keep it steady!


344
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.060
When you get a German
to speak to you in English...


345
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.340
I really was happy.

346
00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.420
We caught and passed one
of the Works cars


347
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.660
and won the race.

348
00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.916
Id never done anything
like that before.


349
00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.700
Nothing took so much out of me

350
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.740
like the Le Mans 24 hours.

351
00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.620
I found JÃ¼rgen.

352
00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.580
And I just put a finger
in JÃ¼rgens back and I said,


353
00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.300
JÃ¼rgen, if theres going to be
a next race,


354
00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.980
can you move the brake pedal
back a little bit?


355
00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.340
The call and the win happened
in a short time for me.


356
00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:52.460
But it took a long time coming!

357
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.100
Go Michelle!

358
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.860
AUDI QUATTRO!!!

359
00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:53.860
Rallying is a very endurance
discipline.


360
00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.380
You have to drive night and day.

361
00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.820
For example, in special
stages the average


362
00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.260
is around 1200 kilometers.

363
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.100
It's really long.

364
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:07.340
So, it's 2000 to 3000 kilometers,
depending on the event.


365
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.180
- So, its... Its long.
- Really long.


366
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.980
Yeah, the cars, you don't
want them to...


367
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.860
Right, so you have to take
care of the cars¦


368
00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.076
And they're not so comfortable.

369
00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.316
And you have to take
care of yourself.


370
00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:22.660
Isn't there a car that can go uphill?
Quick! Mamma Mia!


371
00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.740
The role of the co-driver
is very important.


372
00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.620
We never mention enough
how important it is, in my opinion.


373
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.100
And Fabrizia was
fantastic with me. Really great help.


374
00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.820
You need a really good co-driver
to give you the rhythm.


375
00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.660
Its very important.

376
00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:50.500
We started the first season
in 1981, with Audi,


377
00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:55.100
and nearly at the end
of the season in San Remo.


378
00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:13.940
You know San Remo was mixed
gravel and tarmac.


379
00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:17.140
So, two days, one night,
on gravel in Tuscany.


380
00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.580
And after a very big battle

381
00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.740
with Ari Vatanen
and Henri Toivonnen...


382
00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.020
Ah, very fast drivers.

383
00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.260
I was leading the rally
for the first time.


384
00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:38.020
By a few seconds, 30 seconds,
I think, something like that.


385
00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.020
So, of course first time,
a lot of pressure,


386
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.940
a lot of nervousness
and I couldnt sleep.


387
00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:50.140
And we had four or five
hours to relax in San Remo.


388
00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.820
And on that last night,
we had a very long stage,


389
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.620
50 kilometers around San Remo,
on asphalt.


390
00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:03.836
And I was sure something
would happen


391
00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:07.340
because Ari didnt want
to be beaten by me.


392
00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.740
I looked at Fabrizia
and I said to her,


393
00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.140
One of us will make a mistake.

394
00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:16.420
So, we will start as if it was the
first stage of the rally.


395
00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.660
And I concentrated and drove
as if it was the first stage


396
00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.980
without pushing too hard.

397
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.540
And Ari made the mistake.

398
00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.900
So, finally I won the rally.

399
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.740
And I just remember,
of course, it was fantastic


400
00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:43.020
and the mechanics went crazy.

401
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.180
They put flowers on my hood
and everything,


402
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.300
It was really a hard time
and a very good time.


403
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.620
Because it was really incredible.

404
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:55.780
First time a woman winning
a World Championship Rally.


405
00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:59.660
And I am still the only one...
Unfortunately.


406
00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:23.100
I was with Lotus for two years.
So, then what happened?


407
00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.260
I got the phone call from Ron Dennis.

408
00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.340
And I was happy to be
with the McLaren team.


409
00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.540
Absolutely. Great big team
and really professional.


410
00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:42.300
But then the '94 season came.
No victories.


411
00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.540
'95, no victories.
'96, no victories.


412
00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.700
Oh la, la. This is...

413
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:50.420
So, it was... it was very difficult

414
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.820
because people started wondering

415
00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.940
ls this guy good enough to win?

416
00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:58.940
Is he good enough for McLaren?

417
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.660
So, it was a tough time.

418
00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.180
And of course,
at the same time, you know...


419
00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:06.620
Michael Schumacher,
you know, when he...


420
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.140
- He was on a roll.
- He was.


421
00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.260
Yes, he was flat out.

422
00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:13.860
So I knew my performance level,

423
00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.540
where I was, compared to him.

424
00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.860
And it was, it was quite...

425
00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.340
- Frustrating.
- Yeah!


426
00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:24.620
Frustrating to see him
winning the world championship.


427
00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:30.900
If you win on Sunday,

428
00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.876
youll be a new King of Germany,
the first one...


429
00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.580
Well talk about this
on Sunday evening.


430
00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.980
Out goes Schumacher!

431
00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.860
The German is out
of the Australian Grand Prix!


432
00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.340
Im quite happy in Benetton
at the moment.


433
00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.700
Ferrari would be very nice
to drive for


434
00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.460
as well as McLaren and Mercedes.

435
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.780
And Williams team
is very successful as well.


436
00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.980
So, there are four good
opportunities.


437
00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.020
And I am going to see
and find out


438
00:34:09.099 --> 00:34:11.420
where Im going to drive
next year.


439
00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.619
Enzo Ferrari handpicked

440
00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:26.660
Luca Montezemolo to run Ferrari

441
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:52.780
In 1993, Ferrari President Luca
Montezemolo hired Jean Todt


442
00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:04.500
In 1996, Jean Todt brought
Michael Schumacher to Ferrari


443
00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:20.940
And Michael Schumacher
wins the Spanish Grand Prix


444
00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.980
after an absolutely superlative drive

445
00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.860
to bring the great Maranello concern

446
00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:32.300
back right to the front
of Formula One.


447
00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:38.980
The year 19¦
I would say, 96/97,


448
00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:42.940
then we started seeing a light
at the end of the tunnel.


449
00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:45.020
The whole team
really started focusing


450
00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.100
on developing the car to be better.

451
00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.340
In 97, I had a first chance

452
00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:53.820
to win a Grand Prix
in the last Grand Prix in Jerez.


453
00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.940
Jacques Villeneuve,
Michael Schumacher,


454
00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.700
were fighting for the Championship.
And it didnt end up so nice.


455
00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:10.380
I want to see a straight fight between
Jacques and myself


456
00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.556
and thats what I want to see.
I want to win the race


457
00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.460
and I want to win
the Championship that way.


458
00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.740
Not by any kind of accident
or whatever.


459
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.900
Thats not my goal.

460
00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.300
Villeneuve gets away

461
00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.300
and Schumacher gets away better!

462
00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:31.820
Mika HÃokkinen is up there.
Fantastic start!


463
00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.620
- Hes through!
- Oh, yes!


464
00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:55.820
That didnt work, Michael!

465
00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.980
You hit the wrong part of him,
my friend!


466
00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:08.460
If Villeneuve can just keep going,

467
00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:11.380
in the points, hes won
the World Championship.


468
00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.420
Theres Michael looking down
the track


469
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.180
to see if Villeneuve
is coming round.


470
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.580
Remember Michael looking through
the fence of Adelaide


471
00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.620
to see if Damon was coming round.

472
00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.380
Well, I think hes going
to see Villeneuve


473
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.580
coming round and round and round.

474
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:31.460
So, it gave me a great opportunity
then to get the lead.


475
00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.060
Ah, you see my hands again?

476
00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:38.580
It just changed now.
To the other side.


477
00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.660
And some team orders.

478
00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:45.660
Mika HÃokkinen has yet
to win a Grand Prix!


479
00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:49.380
And the Finn has driven
in 95 of them already.


480
00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.500
He can smell victory!

481
00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.380
Keep concentrating, Jacques,

482
00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.220
because HÃokkinen
is immediately behind.


483
00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:56.980
Last lap. Last lap.

484
00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:01.180
Patrick Head has just walked down
and into the McLaren garage,


485
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.100
obviously, to have a word
with them down there.


486
00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:22.860
- There he goes!
- Hes let him through.


487
00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.380
Hes coming up to the last corner.

488
00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:34.220
HÃokkinen is going to win
the European Grand Prix!


489
00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:37.580
And Jacques Villeneuve settles
for third place


490
00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:41.500
in the World Championship of 1997.

491
00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.780
Wow!

492
00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:51.660
It took me seven years to win
in a Grand Prix.


493
00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.060
- So, it took long time.
- Long time.


494
00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.460
It was a great victory.

495
00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:59.380
Finally, the champagne.

496
00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:02.420
And it was great to win there,
in last Grand Prix,


497
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:06.020
because I was a winner
all winter.


498
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.980
So, it gave me a good feeling,
good confidence.


499
00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:10.516
Anybody who's
watched you and Mika HÃokkinen


500
00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.140
come to each race, every year,
try to get just one win.


501
00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.980
It may be a championship
that was at stake


502
00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:15.980
but for Mika HÃokkinen,

503
00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:17.556
its the most important
day of his career.


504
00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:19.716
Its the last one. Its fantastic.
Its really, really good.


505
00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:22.900
It gives us a very good place
for the next season. Its fantastic.


506
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.740
If I wouldnt have won there, in ˜97,

507
00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:30.420
I think I would have lost
maybe my motivation.


508
00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.500
It was such a long time.

509
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.180
I braked on the maximum
and then he braked even later,


510
00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.220
which as I said,

511
00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.620
with this braking point
I wouldnt have make the corner


512
00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.220
and he wouldnt have made
the corner.


513
00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.500
So, he used me a little
bit as a braking on top.


514
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:15.780
But, well, as I said before,

515
00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:17.596
I probably wouldnt have done
anything different.


516
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.620
Villeneuve was excellent.

517
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.700
That was the only point
he could have gone through.


518
00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:25.220
Schumacher was taken by surprise,

519
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.260
and didn't think
he'd be attacked like that,


520
00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:32.140
taking the corner
as wide as he did.


521
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.780
If you want to avoid being overtaken,
you stay tight,


522
00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:39.100
or close the gap a lot earlier.

523
00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.460
Opinion has turned
against Schumacher,


524
00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:49.100
in his native Germany and in Italy,
the home of the Ferrari team.


525
00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.180
All of the racing press

526
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.420
has some pretty uncomplimentary
things to say about him,


527
00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:55.260
and the Italian press say that
Ferrari should sack him


528
00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.340
and that he should apologize.

529
00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.380
I never said I know everything
about Formula 1


530
00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:04.900
and the case proved that
Im a human being as everyone else


531
00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:08.180
and, unfortunately,
I make mistakes.


532
00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.316
That was one of my mistakes.

533
00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.060
I dont do many. 
But it was one.

534
00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.100
I couldnt give to all the Tifosis

535
00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:19.460
and the Ferrari team what they
expected me to deliver.


536
00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:23.540
And thats something,
Im very sorry about.


537
00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.300
In 2006, I had the
best day of my life.


538
00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:42.060
Racing in Formula 1, in Ferrari,

539
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.660
its like a dream come true,
definitely.


540
00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:47.060
Michael was my teammate.

541
00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:50.980
He was just an unbelievable driver,

542
00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.220
at the best moment of his career.

543
00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.260
But I took the pole position!

544
00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:02.820
Go! RaikÃ♫nnen on the right,
Massa to the left.


545
00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.740
The Brazilian Grand Prix
of 2006 is underway.


546
00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:09.300
Leading the race, I was quite
confident in first position.


547
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:15.340
Massa, 2.5 seconds faster
than anybody else on the race track.


548
00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.020
Massa wins the Brazilian Grand Prix!

549
00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.380
Here he comes across
the start-finish line now


550
00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:36.860
and he thoroughly deserves it.

551
00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:39.300
An absolutely brilliant performance!

552
00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:42.140
Look at this crowd.
Theyre going absolutely bananas!


553
00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:45.260
The first Brazilian
since Ayrton Senna, in ˜93,


554
00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.220
to win his home Grand Prix.

555
00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:52.980
It was such important moment
for me,


556
00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:57.820
that Michael was so close,
was so warm,


557
00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:03.020
to celebrate my victory together.
So, I will never forget.


558
00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:16.940
It was definitely the most
incredible day of my career.


559
00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:18.420
Winning at home for the first time.

560
00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:27.300
So, 2008 was a very special
and good season.


561
00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:33.620
We didnt get a great start
to the season,


562
00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:37.700
not the first couple
of races, especially me.


563
00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:41.956
Its the best possible start
to the season for Lewis Hamilton!


564
00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:45.260
But then after two races,
everything just changed.


565
00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:47.140
Hamilton is up in the air!

566
00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:48.820
BAHRAIN GP April 6, 2008

567
00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.140
A terrific drive
by Felipe Massa.


568
00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:52.460
TURKISH GP May 11, 2008

569
00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:55.380
No one today could match
Felipe Massa.


570
00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.900
Felipe Massa wins the
French Grand Prix.


571
00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:02.820
Hes a genuine title
contender.


572
00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:07.116
Hamilton holds the inside line
and squeezes Massa,


573
00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.580
but Massa has made it through!

574
00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.780
What a bold move there
by Felipe Massa!


575
00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:14.100
And he has taken control
of this race!


576
00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:19.940
With only three laps to go,
absolute disaster for Felipe Massa


577
00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:21.700
who had done everything right!

578
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:32.740
Oh no!
Hes taken the hose with him!


579
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:37.460
It could well cost him
the world championship!


580
00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:40.620
He got a green light.
Massa did nothing wrong there.


581
00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:44.420
Lewis Hamilton wins
the Chinese Grand Prix.


582
00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.020
Hes not going to take
the World Championship home today,


583
00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.140
but hes going to a take
a big step closer to it.


584
00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.740
Hes got a seven-point margin
going into the final round.


585
00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:53.740
Felipe Massas face says it all.

586
00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:59.900
And then we arrived
at this last race of the season,


587
00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:02.020
which was Interlagos.

588
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.780
I was actually behind
on the Championship.


589
00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.620
So, if I won the race,

590
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.020
which was the only
thing I had to do,

591
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:46.300
Lewis couldnt finish fifth,

592
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:48.100
so he had to finish sixth

593
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.860
and then we are the Champions.

594
00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:04.860
I really felt the car in my hands.

595
00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:07.780
You know, the way you drive the car,
the way you feel the car,


596
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.140
the way the team was working.

597
00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:12.180
So everything was really perfect.

598
00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:26.660
Lewis was around fourth position,
something like that.


599
00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:29.220
So, everything was going his way

600
00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.140
to win the Championship.

601
00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:33.980
And then suddenly it started
raining really heavily.


602
00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.420
Oh my goodness me!
Vettel has taken a place


603
00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.740
and that could cost Hamilton
the World Championship.


604
00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:47.060
- Oh, its raining though.
- Its now raining hard...


605
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:50.260
and the championship is
slipping away from Lewis Hamilton.


606
00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:53.540
And then we came to the last lap.

607
00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:58.220
Everybodys expectation was really
high for me to win the race


608
00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.460
but also the Championship.

609
00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:08.300
When I crossed the chequered flag,
I was the champion, you know?


610
00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:12.180
And, so everybody was going really
crazy around my place,


611
00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:14.580
my town, my country!

612
00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:22.540
Can Hamilton do anything?

613
00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:24.660
Can he run it
up the inside of Vettel?

614
00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.580
Only a few corners to go now

615
00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:30.420
and desperation starts to creep in
for Lewis Hamilton.


616
00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:31.860
Is that Glock going slowly?

617
00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:33.076
- It is! Its Glock!
- Thats Glock!


618
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.700
Oh, my goodness me!
Hamiltons back in position again.


619
00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:39.500
A hundred thousand local hearts
sink in the grandstands.


620
00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.420
Its handed 5th place
back to Hamilton!


621
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:42.580
He comes through.

622
00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.300
You are absolutely right, Im sure,

623
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:46.260
that he is going to claim fifth place

624
00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:48.820
which is all he needs
to do to become...


625
00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:49.300
Yes!

626
00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:53.860
The 2008 Formula 1 World
Champion: Lewis Hamilton.


627
00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:08.940
It was tough, you know.

628
00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:10.860
I think especially for everybody

629
00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:12.220
that was watching the race.

630
00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.700
It has never happened,
at least in Formula 1,


631
00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:18.060
to decide the Championship like this.

632
00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:19.676
It was close. It couldnt
have been closer.


633
00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:20.740
In this moment, you know?

634
00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:23.980
But I think the best
thing was looking to the fans,


635
00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:26.100
looking to the people.

636
00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:30.780
It was like, I won the race,
thanks to all of you.


637
00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:37.860
This really helped me
to get up on the podium


638
00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:42.300
and kind of celebrate
what happened.


639
00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:47.060
A very dignified, very, very
dignified performance


640
00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:51.100
by an utterly devastated
Felipe Massa.


641
00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:18.980
I started my season in 1982
with a win in Portugal.


642
00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:22.060
So, it was a confirmation
of San Remo,


643
00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:23.540
so it was really great.

644
00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:27.100
Everybody was very happy.
Then, we went to Greece.


645
00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:43.020
And I won in Greece, also.
And at that time, you know,


646
00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:47.620
the position of women in those
countries was really difficult.


647
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:49.860
And I really remember, you know,

648
00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.700
all the old ladies on the side
of the road with flowers.


649
00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.980
It was really a very special moment

650
00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:00.900
to see that people realized
that it was a team


651
00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:06.060
of two women winning.
It was special.


652
00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:10.420
The next round of the Championship

653
00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.260
could see you overtaking Walter
or perhaps drawing even.


654
00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:15.780
Could we possibly see a lady
World Champion this year?


655
00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.940
I dont want to think about the
World Championship, you know.


656
00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:22.300
I want to think about each event,
and we will see at the finish.


657
00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:29.100
And the fight was with Walter RÃ♫hrl
at that time.


658
00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:35.500
And we were at the penultimate event,
in the Ivory Coast


659
00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:53.980
If I won in the Ivory Coast
I only had to finish the rally,


660
00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:55.980
here in England,
to be World Champion.


661
00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:00.340
So, we started
and everything went well


662
00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:01.780
because it was very muddy.

663
00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:07.180
Very difficult conditions.

664
00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:20.580
I started to lead by a lot
and by the middle of the rally


665
00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:24.900
I was more than 1 hour
and 20 minutes ahead of Walter.


666
00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:36.780
And suddenly I started to feel
the gear shift


667
00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.940
become a little bit harder.

668
00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:45.140
30 seconds. Quickly.

669
00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:49.540
Were done, boss.

670
00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:51.580
- Yes, yes! Come on!
- Yes.


671
00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:54.620
We lost 5 minutes because of you,
yesterday.


672
00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:03.860
I spoke with Hannu,
and I said, What we do?


673
00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:06.220
He said, I mean, we have

674
00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:08.940
No, no, dont think about it.

675
00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:10.596
We change the gearbox
and thats all.


676
00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:15.260
So, we decided what parts
of the gearbox we'd fix.


677
00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:19.260
Normally, it was around 20 minutes
to change it, at that time.


678
00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:32.140
The mechanics start to work.

679
00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:35.500
At 40 minutes they said,
Okay, jump in the car.


680
00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:36.740
So, we jumped in the car.

681
00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:40.500
I put the car into gear, and then,
no clutch, no gear.


682
00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:42.620
Everything had seized up.

683
00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:45.300
And I have two Germans
in front of me saying,


684
00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:46.660
lt should work.

685
00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:49.860
I said No!

686
00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:52.820
And nothing worked.
So, they started all over again.


687
00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:12.460
So, I lost all of my time.

688
00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:14.500
And then we had foggy conditions

689
00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:17.340
and you know, in Portugal, in the fog

690
00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:19.380
I made up two minutes on Walter,

691
00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:21.340
in an eight kilometer stage.

692
00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:24.180
Because its so important
with your co-driver


693
00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:25.340
to have good notes.

694
00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:27.900
You dont see anything,
but you hear, you know,


695
00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:31.060
Hundred meters,

696
00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.980
I learned that you never
make up time.


697
00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:46.500
I got confused with the notes

698
00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:49.420
and I rolled the car
and we stopped there.


699
00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:13.700
But the story was a little bit worse

700
00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:15.940
because we started the race

701
00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:20.260
at 9 or 10 oclock in the morning.

702
00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:24.060
But at 7 a.m. I got a phone call
from my family


703
00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:26.660
saying that my father
had passed away.


704
00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:30.780
It was hard to cope with that.

705
00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:36.140
Just thinking about it
reminds me of how hard it was.


706
00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:38.980
So, I spoke to Fabrizia, I said,

707
00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:42.580
Okay, this is what happened.
We will do the race.


708
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:47.140
I will not say anything to anybody."
And we get back in the car.


709
00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:48.700
- And so, we were...
- Oh my God.


710
00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:49.940
And we lost the Championship.

711
00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:52.900
But I always said I didnt even
think about the Championship


712
00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:56.900
because the difference between
losing my father and...


713
00:54:56.980 --> 00:55:00.820
So I didnt even think about that.

714
00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:02.700
I just left and went back home.

715
00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:15.060
˜98 was definitely
a great year for me.


716
00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:18.220
When we went to the very first test
with that ˜98 car,


717
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.020
it was like a rocket.

718
00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:22.060
Great start from HÃokkinen!

719
00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:23.860
Great start from HÃokkinen!
Hes through,


720
00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:26.100
hes passed Schumacher
and Coulthard.


721
00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:29.580
I mean, we were so fast!

722
00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:32.700
Of course, racing against
Michael Schumacher...


723
00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:34.740
Schumachers going for
the lead at the Roggia.


724
00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:37.380
And hes right up alongside.
And hes going through!


725
00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:38.660
Fantastic!

726
00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:42.580
HÃokkinen fights back!
This is magnificent!


727
00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:47.820
The lead changes twice
in about 400 yards!


728
00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:50.980
I felt great because Michael
had great success already


729
00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:54.380
and it was nice to kick his ass!

730
00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:56.500
So, the season went on and on.

731
00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:59.380
Sometimes I had a little bad luck,
sometimes I made a mistake...


732
00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:03.100
Hes out! Hes out!

733
00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:05.180
Then vice versa for Michael.

734
00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:08.820
Schumacher leading Damon Hill there
by 27 seconds now,


735
00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:10.420
in a class of his own.

736
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:14.980
Oh God! Michael Schumacher
hits David Coulthard


737
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:18.020
and is out of the Belgian Grand Prix!

738
00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:19.900
But towards the end of the season,

739
00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:26.060
we were nearly on the equal points
going into the last Grand Prix.


740
00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:28.020
So, I needed to win.

741
00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:51.620
And its go, go, go!

742
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:54.500
Yellow flag. A drivers
stalled on the line.


743
00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:55.700
That is Michael Schumacher.

744
00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:57.500
Will he end up on the back
of the grid?


745
00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:59.220
Hes shaking his head, look.

746
00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:02.380
Michael Schumacher,
under the terms of the regulations,


747
00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:05.260
has to start this race
from the back of the grid.


748
00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:06.540
Well, if that is the case,

749
00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:09.020
Michael Schumacher has almost
certainly lost


750
00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:12.180
the World Championship
before this race even begins.


751
00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:13.780
So, I went Yay!

752
00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:16.156
No. I didnt do this
but I was like,


753
00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:19.180
"Stay calm. Its not over yet.
Its not over yet."


754
00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:20.460
You did inside.

755
00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:22.380
Yes! Absolutely.

756
00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:30.820
So, I got the lead
and I knew I was going to pull away.


757
00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:33.820
I just need to stay consistent
and not make mistakes.


758
00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:35.780
Michael is pushing incredibly hard.

759
00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:37.356
Hes still got a sniff of it.

760
00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:40.260
21 seconds behind the race leader
Mika HÃokkinen.


761
00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:43.180
So, there is still a small chance
of victory


762
00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:44.860
and a World Championship here.

763
00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:51.460
Michael Schumacher
on the ragged edge.


764
00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:56.860
It was never a situation that you
could relax¦


765
00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:00.220
Until I saw it on a big screen.

766
00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:16.220
Michael Schumacher retires from
the Japanese Grand Prix.


767
00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:17.756
Mika HÃokkinen is the World Champion.

768
00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:20.860
Mika HÃokkinen is
World Champion of 1998.


769
00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:23.220
And I was, again, Yeah!

770
00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:26.580
And it was great to finish
the Grand Prix


771
00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:29.340
and to be a World Champion
after all these years.


772
00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:31.460
And then Michael came
to congratulate me.


773
00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:33.700
It was really, really cool of him.

774
00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:47.620
Mika HÃokkinen, from Finland,
the World Champion.


775
00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:50.220
And the ˜99 season, again.

776
00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:52.580
Michael and me
and Ferrari and fighting...


777
00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:55.316
- Fighting against...
- So, you fight a lot together?


778
00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:58.260
Yeah, again, challenging
to win Grand Prix.


779
00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:02.140
And then Michael
had his accident in Silverstone.


780
00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:11.740
It looked really nasty
and he did break his...


781
00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:12.940
- Hurt his...
- Hurt his leg.


782
00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:15.420
So, he was out of the game

783
00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:18.700
and I didnt celebrate that time,
of course,


784
00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:21.460
because he hurt himself.

785
00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:22.780
Michael is basically alright

786
00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:26.900
and they've flown him to the hospital
just to check his leg.


787
00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:28.580
So, I was thinking,

788
00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:31.780
Okay, maybe this season is going
to be a bit easier


789
00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:37.260
But then, the pressure was just
incredible.


790
00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:39.740
To handle that pressure,

791
00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:44.540
finding and controlling your emotions.

792
00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:46.780
Oh, and thats HÃokkinen spinning!

793
00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:48.860
Out goes HÃokkinen!
HÃokkinen the race leader!


794
00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:54.900
Mentally really tough.

795
00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:57.900
So, all the preparation
for the last Grand Prix was...


796
00:59:57.980 --> 00:59:59.420
Everything had to be perfect.

797
00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:02.220
Your personal thoughts
working with you.


798
01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:05.340
The team had to be perfect.
It was a great feeling.


799
01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:09.020
A great two years.
Beautiful, beautiful years.


800
01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:13.140
I think 2000
was a great season again.


801
01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:13.860
Yeah!

802
01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:18.140
What stands out, I think, for us,
was the Kemmel Straight at Spa


803
01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:21.940
when you had that hard fight
between Michael and you.


804
01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:35.900
I tried to overtake Michael,
I think, three or four times,


805
01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:39.100
and every time he pushed
me on the grass.


806
01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.100
And I knew that next lap,

807
01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.516
if I tried to overtake Michael again,
he would push, you know,


808
01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:48.540
he would block me.

809
01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:53.260
The only place I was able to overtake
was after Eau Rouge.


810
01:00:55.460 --> 01:01:00.100
I could see a back-marker,
Ricardo Zonta,


811
01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:01.460
driving in middle of the track.

812
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:07.180
It was logical for Michael
to overtake him on the left,


813
01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.660
because the next corner
was to the right.


814
01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:13.020
So I decide to go across
to the other side.


815
01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:18.020
A brilliant move there,
either side of Zonta.


816
01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:22.420
And HÃokkinen brilliantly takes
the lead of the Belgian Grand Prix.


817
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.340
It was quite a risk
when we overtook him.


818
01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:25.460
ERJA HÃ„KKINEN Mika's Wife

819
01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.100
It's guaranteed he needed
to change


820
01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:32.140
his underpants after the race!

821
01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:41.820
HÃokkinen is now six points
ahead of Michael Schumacher


822
01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:46.820
in the World Championship.
Mika HÃokkinen has the advantage.


823
01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:49.700
Well, it was incredible.

824
01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:57.980
It was¦ incredible.

825
01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:02.740
I knew, following Michael,

826
01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:06.140
there was no point in trying
to overtake him on the straight


827
01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:09.700
because, obviously, hes not going
to give me room. Correct?


828
01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:11.780
Yes, I made it difficult.

829
01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:13.980
I had a word with him
after the race. I said,


830
01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:17.900
Come on man, you are risking
not only your life, but also my life.


831
01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:20.420
And he just looked at me,
This is racing.


832
01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:23.300
And I said, Yes, but...

833
01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:25.060
- Where is the limit?
- Yeah.


834
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:26.740
That was his style of driving.

835
01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:45.180
I have to win it.

836
01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:46.316
How are you feeling about that?

837
01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:47.980
Terrible.

838
01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.820
Michael Schumacher is definitely
very nervous.


839
01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.780
He needs to deliver this championship

840
01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:56.980
for himself and for Ferrari.

841
01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:03.100
Its go! And Michael Schumacher
cuts straight across


842
01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.100
and drives Mika HÃokkinen
towards the wall.


843
01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:07.140
But HÃokkinen's done it again!

844
01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:10.660
Hes taken the lead as he did
last year and the year before.


845
01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:28.460
Its now going to come down
to strategy and pit stops.


846
01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:36.180
These next two laps could well decide
the Japanese Grand Prix,


847
01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:38.380
and the World Championship.

848
01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:00.740
Here comes Michael Schumacher,
rejoining the track,


849
01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:03.300
and hes ahead of Mika HÃokkinen.

850
01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:20.580
Michael Schumacher to win
the 2000 Japanese Grand Prix


851
01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:22.700
and the World Championship

852
01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:26.060
to give Ferrari and Italy their dream.

853
01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:29.580
Michael, give us your feelings.

854
01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:34.460
I dont have words. Shit!
You are great, Ross.


855
01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:40.540
Youre great Ross. Shit!
We did it! We did it!


856
01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:43.500
Give Corinna a big kiss from me.

857
01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:46.460
The first World Championship
for Ferrari for 21 years.


858
01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:47.756
You are one of the architects of it.

859
01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:49.700
Tell us what it means to
you and to this team.


860
01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.300
Personally, its why I came
to Ferrari. To do this.


861
01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:54.540
So, Ive achieved my dream.

862
01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:57.300
And so has everyone else in the team.

863
01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:12.140
Michael is a great driver

864
01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:15.420
but on top of that,
hes a great man.


865
01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.180
We have been together
when things were very bad


866
01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:20.940
and we are together
when things are very good.


867
01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.300
But I mean I love Michael.

868
01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:25.740
I loved him when he had
the accident at Silverstone,


869
01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:28.580
and I love him today after he gave

870
01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:30.980
the driving championship
to Ferrari.


871
01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.180
Its like father and son, yes?

872
01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:37.140
Am I so old? Two brothers.

873
01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:43.700
- Michael Schumacher!
- Yes!!!


874
01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:50.756
Mika, youve been a superb
World Champion for the last two years


875
01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.700
but your reign, for now, is over.
How do you feel?


876
01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:55.940
So sad.

877
01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:59.020
A bit disappointed
but at the same time I feel...


878
01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:05.180
I have won two years in a row,
in ˜98 and 99,


879
01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:08.780
you know, I understand
it is sometimes


880
01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:11.420
some other driver's turn to win.

881
01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:16.140
Life continues and racing continues.
You have to keep fighting.


882
01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:49.100
- Hello.
- Hello.


883
01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:50.100
- Hello.
- Good evening.


884
01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:54.820
DOMINATION

885
01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:56.300
INGOLSTADT Germany, 2000

886
01:07:56.380 --> 01:08:00.300
I got invited out to see
Dr. Ullrich at Audi in Ingolstadt.


887
01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:06.100
I have to say, a very humble
building where they started from...


888
01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:07.220
My time.

889
01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:08.556
With your time,
with the rally program,


890
01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:13.900
they were still in the same place.
I really felt a good chemistry.


891
01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:18.020
Ullrich showed me the drawings
of the R8


892
01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:21.539
which they were going to enter
for the 2000 Le Mans.


893
01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:25.660
Some people
were questioning my going to Audi


894
01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:26.860
but I gave him a handshake

895
01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:28.820
and thats the best decision
Ive ever made.


896
01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:54.100
Tom Kristensen, equals the record
of the Belgian Jacky Ickx!


897
01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:02.780
Tom Kristensen is the greatest
ever driver of Le Mans!


898
01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.619
Lap times are good.

899
01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:24.860
Tom Kristensen is Mr. Le Mans!

900
01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:26.060
Sure, there is the pressure.

901
01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:28.299
But there is also the privilege
of the dream,


902
01:09:28.379 --> 01:09:30.900
of how we started
with a passion of doing well.


903
01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:59.459
The Aston Martin at the chicane.
Its Allan Simonsen at the wheel.


904
01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:15.100
Allan Simonsen has died
as a result of that crash.


905
01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:38.980
I went into this race,

906
01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:41.260
I wanted really to race for my dad,

907
01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:43.619
because he passed away this year.

908
01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:50.660
But if I just imagine myself
sitting down


909
01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:56.060
and having a little Danish beer
with Allan and my dad


910
01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:58.660
then we would both agree

911
01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:03.020
that I should try to win this race
with Audi for Allan.


912
01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:05.500
This is what we did, so...

913
01:11:06.619 --> 01:11:09.060
You dont call that a happy ending.

914
01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.539
Ferrari are Constructors'
World Champions


915
01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:26.860
Michael Schumacher
is World Champion!


916
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:29.580
It is a great achievement
for the team.


917
01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:33.580
And it shows the great
domination of Ferrari.


918
01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:40.619
Michael Schumacher.
He is five-time World Champion.


919
01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:47.060
Im just so glad that we have
achieved this together,


920
01:11:47.459 --> 01:11:50.700
with people behind you
that you can just love


921
01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:53.860
and you can admire,
with all the effort they put in.


922
01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:56.420
There are some rumors that
maybe this dream team


923
01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.619
is going to split up in some way

924
01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:00.860
because Luca de Montezemolo
maybe is...


925
01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:02.500
Dont believe in rumors.

926
01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.539
We are here together.
Happy together.


927
01:12:04.619 --> 01:12:08.420
And we will stay together
for many years.


928
01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:16.860
Michael Schumacher, the first six-time
World Formula 1 Champion.


929
01:12:34.539 --> 01:12:38.100
That grey and black speck
in the distance is Kimi RÃoikkÃ♫nen.


930
01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:53.860
A magnificent win for Kimi RÃoikkÃ♫nen!
Well done to him.


931
01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:55.459
But Michael Schumacher

932
01:12:55.539 --> 01:13:00.340
gets his seventh Formula 1
World Championship.


933
01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:34.996
Isnt this a race lovers heaven?

934
01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:37.340
The three best drivers in the world

935
01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:40.500
going toe-to-toe around one
of its finest race tracks.


936
01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:43.300
Schumacher. Alonso. 
RÃoikkÃ♫nen.

937
01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:50.619
Fernando Alonso trying
to pass Michael Schumacher.


938
01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:56.660
180 mph around the outside
of the 130R corner!


939
01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:58.539
Ive never seen anything like it!

940
01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:07.020
Look how calm it is behind the wheel.

941
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.860
RÃoikkÃ♫nen getting past
Michael Schumacher.


942
01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:55.619
One of the best days
of my life, 1975, September,


943
01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:59.140
when we won the championship,
with Nikki Lauda, here in Monza.


944
01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:04.020
It is, of course,
an important weekend


945
01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:10.459
because we will announce
the next seasons team.


946
01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:16.780
Michael is an important
part of my life.


947
01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:21.140
We have faced fantastic moments
and difficult moments.


948
01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:23.340
But he has always been very loyal.

949
01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.020
You must be excited to join Ferrari?

950
01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:37.060
I dont know what
you are talking about.


951
01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:39.260
Are we going to learn your
future this weekend?


952
01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:42.700
We just need to wait and see.

953
01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:01.500
Michael Schumacher wins
the Italian Grand Prix!


954
01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:20.860
The official press release,
there it is.


955
01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:22.220
Look at the top line.

956
01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:25.140
Michael Schumacher
will retire from race driving


957
01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:28.700
at the end of the 2006
World Championship.


958
01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:31.140
So, its the news
that every Ferrari fan,


959
01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:32.740
and every Michael Schumacher fan,

960
01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:34.140
did not want to hear.

961
01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:36.940
Its got a load of PR nice stuff

962
01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:38.619
about how he loves Ferrari...

963
01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:41.740
Look, even his engineer
Chris Dyer hasnt seen this.


964
01:16:58.619 --> 01:17:00.500
At the end of this year,
Ive decided,


965
01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:01.740
together with the team,

966
01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:06.619
that Im going to retire from racing.

967
01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:11.060
It has been an exceptional.
A really exceptional time,


968
01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:14.300
what motorsport has given
to me, for more than 30 years.


969
01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:20.220
Particularly, I should thank
my family


970
01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.380
starting with, obviously, my dad,

971
01:17:23.539 --> 01:17:25.980
my mum, who has passed away.

972
01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:31.340
And now, I just want to concentrate

973
01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:36.820
on the last three events
and finish in style.


974
01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:41.180
For him, it is the right time.
He is on the top,


975
01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:47.180
and I am sure he will have
a very nice life.


976
01:17:53.459 --> 01:17:56.539
Michael will remain a member
of the Ferrari family,


977
01:17:56.619 --> 01:17:57.940
this for sure.

978
01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:19.459
Tonight, we have with us,

979
01:18:19.539 --> 01:18:23.539
our chief test driver,
Michael Schumacher.


980
01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:33.740
And since, unfortunately,
he decided to retire,


981
01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:36.700
he has been in charge
of the development


982
01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:40.780
of the 458 Italia.
Michael...


983
01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:42.740
Thank you. Thank you
for the introduction.


984
01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:48.300
I wish everybody who has the
opportunity to test it,


985
01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:49.860
great fun and enjoy.
Thank you.


986
01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:26.700
Something happened that
nobody would believe.


987
01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:28.820
Yes, really unbelievable.

988
01:19:29.539 --> 01:19:34.580
I was in Budapest in 2009
and I did my qualifying lap...


989
01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:41.380
FRAGILE

990
01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:05.700
Exit of corner five,

991
01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:10.180
Rubens lost his spring,
the third spring of his car,


992
01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:15.660
and I was coming
around 250 km/h,


993
01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:19.300
And the spring just hit my head.

994
01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:25.700
The spring.
How much did it weigh?


995
01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:27.220
One kilo.

996
01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:29.420
And youre arriving 250?

997
01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.500
Arriving 250.

998
01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:33.619
I went to the hospital.

999
01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:37.940
And they performed quite
an intense operation.


1000
01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:48.700
With all the faith in our religion,
may you pray for him.


1001
01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:53.539
So, then they remove all the bones,
and then close it up,


1002
01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:56.180
and I was in
a coma for three days.

1003
01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:03.580
I flew back to Brazil.

1004
01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.459
And they did another big operation,

1005
01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:11.340
a month after,
to put in a plate¦


1006
01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:13.180
- Okay.
- Here, you know?


1007
01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.980
Because I lost all
the bone in this area.


1008
01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:20.900
It took really a long time
to get back to the car.


1009
01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:25.420
You always know you want
to go back to racing.


1010
01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:28.300
- But you never believe something...
- Will happen to you.


1011
01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:29.060
Will happen to you.

1012
01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:33.220
When it happens to you,
you respect life.


1013
01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:36.459
Not only yours but everybodys,
in a big way.


1014
01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:47.780
The hardest hit I had
was in DTM 2007.


1015
01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:03.260
I dont remember,
in a way, for days,


1016
01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:07.340
but apparently, the car took
an impact of 63 Gs.


1017
01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:11.060
The recovery was not in a coma.

1018
01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:13.340
But I knew how close it was.

1019
01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:23.619
Our team doctor, Dr. Young,

1020
01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:27.459
we always called him Dr. Death,
but...


1021
01:22:27.539 --> 01:22:29.820
- when we needed him...
- He was there.


1022
01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:30.780
He was always there.

1023
01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:33.580
He came to visit me in Denmark
and said,


1024
01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:36.660
You have to see a neurologist.

1025
01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:38.380
And if he gives you the thumbs up,

1026
01:22:38.459 --> 01:22:40.060
you can start working again.

1027
01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:42.700
Before he does it, its tough.

1028
01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:45.980
Basically, I made my decision
to come back at Le Mans.


1029
01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:48.539
He couldnt believe that
I wanted to race again.


1030
01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:52.220
When I felt good enough, I said,

1031
01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:54.660
Can I have a
go in a car again?

1032
01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:56.420
And actually, this healed my
process,


1033
01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:57.780
because when I drove,

1034
01:22:57.860 --> 01:23:01.539
I knew instinctively that
this is where I belong.


1035
01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:06.020
But I think the message was,

1036
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:07.420
I dont want to stop like that.

1037
01:23:07.459 --> 01:23:08.980
I dont want to have
somebody...


1038
01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:12.140
- something...
- To determine... And that was...


1039
01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:13.220
You wanted to decide.

1040
01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:14.356
It was a nice way to come back.

1041
01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:18.820
You dont stop, you dont decide
your career by an accident.


1042
01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:22.660
I feel very sorry for the people
in racing who,


1043
01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:26.820
due to injuries,
are not able to come back.


1044
01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:35.580
I had my accident in 95.
It was quite a challenge.


1045
01:23:37.459 --> 01:23:40.660
Because what happened, happened
in Australia, in Adelaide.


1046
01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:44.820
I was going flat out
on a long straight.


1047
01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:49.740
Just when I was entering the corner,
the rear tire didnt explode,


1048
01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:52.740
it just lost pressure very quickly.

1049
01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:55.260
And so, the car started bottoming.

1050
01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:57.196
And I lost the control, of course.

1051
01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:59.300
There was a massive curb in the exit

1052
01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:01.300
and of course I hit that curb

1053
01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:04.900
and the car bounced
a couple of times on the ground


1054
01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:07.140
and hit the barrier sideways.

1055
01:24:09.539 --> 01:24:11.860
At that time, we didnt have
the HANS protection,


1056
01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:14.740
or the¦
I dont know exactly...


1057
01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:16.380
- The headrest.
- Headrest system.


1058
01:24:16.459 --> 01:24:19.820
So, you know, my head
moved pretty aggressively.


1059
01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:23.660
So, it was a really difficult time.

1060
01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:39.956
But I was very fortunate because,

1061
01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:42.060
in the corner where the accident
happened,


1062
01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:43.900
all the medical crew was there.

1063
01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:46.700
The hospital was just 5 minutes away.

1064
01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:51.260
So everything happened very quickly.
I got help very fast.


1065
01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:11.420
And the level of care
that hes received


1066
01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:14.980
has been absolutely exceptional.

1067
01:25:15.539 --> 01:25:19.300
They performed a tracheotomy
at the side of the car.


1068
01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:24.980
There is still some possibility
of the brain swelling.


1069
01:25:25.619 --> 01:25:30.780
He was truly, and still is,
in a critical condition.


1070
01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:41.100
So yeah, I was in a coma
a few days


1071
01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:46.980
and then the really horrible
things started, you know?


1072
01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:53.380
Because when you wake up,
you start realizing 'Oh my God!


1073
01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:55.459
Because I banged so hard,

1074
01:25:55.539 --> 01:26:00.380
I lost control of
one side of my face.

1075
01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:02.940
The nerves got damaged.

1076
01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:04.539
So, when you were sleeping,

1077
01:26:04.619 --> 01:26:06.100
they had to put tape
on your eyes,


1078
01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:08.180
to keep them closed.

1079
01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:12.380
Then the time came
when they started to test


1080
01:26:12.459 --> 01:26:16.260
whether you can smell normally,

1081
01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:17.940
you can taste normally,
you can walk.


1082
01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:19.540
How long you did you stay
in Australia?


1083
01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:21.580
I think I was over there
for five weeks.


1084
01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:22.700
Five weeks.

1085
01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:27.060
And my girlfriend flew to
Australia to support me.


1086
01:26:28.539 --> 01:26:33.420
Automatically, you really put
thoughts away about motor racing.


1087
01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:37.100
You start thinking,
"I can move my hands..."


1088
01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:41.020
And you know,
those priorities come into your life.


1089
01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:45.780
Later on, the accident helped
me in my racing career.


1090
01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:48.700
Slow down a bit. You dont have to
run all the time.


1091
01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:51.539
Walk. Think.
Take your time.


1092
01:26:51.619 --> 01:26:53.219
Look around you at whats happening.

1093
01:26:56.980 --> 01:27:01.940
Then in 2001, I had quite
a few accidents.


1094
01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:18.459
You start thinking
a little bit differently.


1095
01:27:18.539 --> 01:27:20.100
I was very fortunate,

1096
01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:23.380
winning the World Championships
of ˜98 and ˜99.


1097
01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:29.100
So, I felt that I had achieved
my goals,


1098
01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:31.940
why I came to Formula 1.

1099
01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:34.340
So, then I decided thats it!

1100
01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:37.980
Its better to do something else.

1101
01:27:39.619 --> 01:27:41.340
And I feel that was

1102
01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:42.636
- a good decision.
- The right decision?


1103
01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:45.020
- The right time?
- Yeah, yeah.


1104
01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:30.900
It was 2014.

1105
01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:33.500
I had the chance to win
my 10th LeMans.


1106
01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:47.180
We were in the lead at midday

1107
01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.740
with less than four hours to the end.

1108
01:28:58.459 --> 01:29:06.180
Accelerating out of Dunlop
corner... the next gear...


1109
01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:09.220
And I felt a little bit
of a loss of power.


1110
01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:12.619
The leader has stopped
out on the circuit.


1111
01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:15.340
Its a hard mistress, this race.

1112
01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:19.420
And then we come in the pit
and it was a blown turbo.


1113
01:29:20.539 --> 01:29:22.220
Obviously bloody hot.

1114
01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:23.459
They were able to change it

1115
01:29:23.539 --> 01:29:28.860
but it took a little bit more
than 15 minutes, maybe nearly 20.


1116
01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:31.180
And we dropped down
to third position.


1117
01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:34.900
We were still pushing until the end.

1118
01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:37.980
Audi doing their fastest laps
of the race.


1119
01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:44.340
A Herculean effort
by the Number 1 car.


1120
01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:46.260
It was very tough.

1121
01:29:49.539 --> 01:29:51.140
And actually,
we won second place.


1122
01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:03.180
Standing there, going to the podium
with a sweaty hand,


1123
01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:05.660
in my mind, on the trophy,

1124
01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:08.940
but not being able to grab it,
I was disappointed.


1125
01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:12.276
And I remember meeting
Dr. Ullrich and saying,


1126
01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:16.140
This is not, this is...
I cant wait for next year.


1127
01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:19.020
But I mean, you cant stop your age,
you cant stop things.


1128
01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:21.700
And a lot of young people
are obviously coming along


1129
01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:23.860
who are very good and very fast.

1130
01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:26.300
I told Hanne
about my decision to stop,


1131
01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:30.780
after she came home
from the shopping center


1132
01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:33.500
and she dropped the bags and said,

1133
01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:38.940
Youre going to be happy.
Thats a very strong decision.


1134
01:30:42.140 --> 01:30:44.260
Family life is the most
important thing.


1135
01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:49.459
And I have not missed
any racing at all, ever since.


1136
01:30:49.539 --> 01:30:50.900
Maybe Im lying a bit there.

1137
01:30:55.619 --> 01:30:58.380
For me, after five years
of the championship,


1138
01:30:58.459 --> 01:31:00.459
I was starting to get
a little bit tired.


1139
01:31:00.539 --> 01:31:04.940
300 days a year
you are on the road,

1140
01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:09.220
so I wanted to slow down a little bit,
I didn't know how.


1141
01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:18.580
Jean Todt was Peugeot team manager
and offered me two events


1142
01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:22.420
in the World Championship,
with the Peugeot 205.


1143
01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:24.459
So I accepted.

1144
01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:26.900
The men drivers are all saying

1145
01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:29.220
its a very hard rally,
long stages.


1146
01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:31.500
Do you think youre strong
enough to cope with this?


1147
01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:34.580
Of course,
its my 12th Tour de Corse.


1148
01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:38.340
I think a woman is more able
to make a constant effort


1149
01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:40.539
than to go very fast
and down after.


1150
01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:43.500
So, I am not afraid of that

1151
01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:48.220
After the first day,
I knew I was at my best.


1152
01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:49.940
I was third overall.

1153
01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:54.780
There is MichÃ¨le Mouton,
going superbly well.


1154
01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:02.820
I had a problem
with the gearshift and I stopped.


1155
01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:06.860
But for me it was my best rally.

1156
01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:10.340
But I had the problem
with the gearshift, again.


1157
01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:15.020
After that I knew that I would miss
out on a family life.


1158
01:32:15.619 --> 01:32:19.500
I was 35 and for me
it was clear.


1159
01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:22.060
I said to Fredrik, who was my partner
at that time, I said,


1160
01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:25.100
Okay, its the end for me.

1161
01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:28.660
And I stopped there,
and I never regretted that,


1162
01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:31.940
because I had my daughter
Jessie the following year.


1163
01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:34.820
And so it was great,
a great time.


1164
01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:44.700
At the end of 2016,
I had a race in Brazil,


1165
01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:48.220
Interlagos,
it was the last race of the season.


1166
01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:54.940
It was raining so much
during the race, red flags¦


1167
01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:57.220
I crashed.

1168
01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:05.619
I was so disappointed that I crashed
in my last race in Brazil.


1169
01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:11.060
I started to walk back to the pits

1170
01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:19.140
and the whole grandstand stood up
and started to wave to me.


1171
01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:26.180
When I got to the pits,

1172
01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:29.140
I saw that everybody
from all the teams,


1173
01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:31.780
even teams that I hadnt raced for,

1174
01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:34.060
were outside their garages
and clapping their hands.


1175
01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:42.100
My son, Felipino,
was waiting for me,


1176
01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:45.340
my wife, and my parents.

1177
01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:48.860
It was an amazing feeling.

1178
01:33:49.619 --> 01:33:51.300
When you see these things happen,

1179
01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:55.020
I think it shows that you have
a lot of respect.


1180
01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:59.020
But I was ready to stop.

1181
01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:03.740
Our sport, its difficult, its
hard. But its also human.


1182
01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:36.300
Im glad to introduce
Michael Schumacher.


1183
01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:49.860
Ross is the leader of this one,

1184
01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:53.100
and Im more than proud
to be a part of you.


1185
01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:55.260
And I look forward
to a great future with all of you.


1186
01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:01.100
Which car do you see
as being the fastest?


1187
01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:04.500
Good question,
were here to find out.


1188
01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:19.020
Am I as good
as I was at 25?

1189
01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:24.100
Who knows? Well find out.
Ill tell you later.


1190
01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:42.420
I lost my front wing again.

1191
01:35:43.459 --> 01:35:45.900
That seems to be my weak
spot at the moment.


1192
01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:48.220
I think we should make
them much stronger, those things.


1193
01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:55.780
Naturally, Im excited and very happy
for this particular weekend.


1194
01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:09.860
I didnt have a clue where I was.
Third position.


1195
01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:12.420
I thought, no, not possible!

1196
01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:35.740
I tried to end this mission
successfully.


1197
01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:37.500
It didnt work, this time,

1198
01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:41.100
But Im quite happy to finish
from here


1199
01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:43.500
and go for a different life,
again.


1200
01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:13.700
My friends. It has been a pleasure
to be with you today.


1201
01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:17.420
Im sorry that I cannot stay,

1202
01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:20.820
but sometimes emotions
can be too strong.


1203
01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:25.220
Reliving my life with you
has been a privilege.


1204
01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:29.140
But it has brought back
many ghosts.


1205
01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:33.860
The next chapter of our story
is too hard for me to tell.


1206
01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:38.660
See you on the road.
Felipe.


1207
01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:56.100
Michael Schumacher is said
to be fighting for his life


1208
01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:58.580
after a skiing accident
in the French Alps.


1209
01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:01.140
The former racing driver is in a coma

1210
01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:02.940
after undergoing brain surgery.

1211
01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:11.860
Michaels injury is heavy,
and the overall situation is critical.


1212
01:40:13.619 --> 01:40:19.539
When I got the news, the irony was,

1213
01:40:19.619 --> 01:40:22.420
I was actually with my family
in Norway.


1214
01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:24.459
We were skiing.

1215
01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:36.260
I couldnt believe it, you know.

1216
01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:39.260
First of all, you think,
okay, it will go,


1217
01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:42.740
because Michael has been
through so many battles


1218
01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:46.420
that you cannot even think
he will lose this one.


1219
01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:49.940
So, you dont want to think
about the worst.


1220
01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:56.021
SHUMI All our thoughts
and prayers for you and your family


1221
01:40:56.740 --> 01:41:00.539
I was shocked. And from
my personal experience,


1222
01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:05.980
having a head injury,
it is always serious.


1223
01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:13.700
With each passing hour,
concern for his recovery grows.


1224
01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:15.796
Gerard Saillant,
Frances top trauma specialist,


1225
01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:17.539
has now flown down from Paris

1226
01:41:17.619 --> 01:41:21.340
in another sign that this is being
taken very seriously indeed.


1227
01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:23.156
The doctors dont want
to make any further statements,


1228
01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:25.459
because they cannot.

1229
01:41:25.539 --> 01:41:28.740
They are working hour-by-hour.

1230
01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:40.580
And everything we heard
about after that,


1231
01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:43.459
I really think that, you know,

1232
01:41:43.539 --> 01:41:46.860
he deserved to have his private life,
his normal life.


1233
01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:57.300
He was such a fantastic person.
Very cool. Very open.


1234
01:41:57.380 --> 01:41:59.380
Smiling, laughing all the time.

1235
01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:07.900
The best times, I think,
I had with Michael...


1236
01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:10.980
There was a rivalry,
like with everyone,


1237
01:42:11.060 --> 01:42:12.619
when we were on the race track.

1238
01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:18.020
Actually in Norway, in Trysil,
when he was there,


1239
01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:20.140
sometimes I joined him
and we played football...


1240
01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:25.980
Just like kids.
That was the best time


1241
01:42:26.060 --> 01:42:29.100
I had with him.

1242
01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:33.700
Formula 1 is a lifestyle.
It isa life.


1243
01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:35.459
And Michael had just decided

1244
01:42:35.539 --> 01:42:37.539
to start enjoying his life
with his family more.


1245
01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:44.300
So, I thought, why now?

1246
01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:50.700
What is the purpose
of this kind of situation?


1247
01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:56.580
Everyone who comes from the
background of a humble family,


1248
01:42:56.660 --> 01:43:00.619
we all deserve
a proper retirement.


1249
01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:02.340
So, thats the irony of the story.

1250
01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:03.860
We have lived flat out.

1251
01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:07.060
We have taken, you cannot believe,
the chances weve taken.


1252
01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:10.820
Trying to make our teams proud

1253
01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:12.940
and at the end of the day,
our families proud.


1254
01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:16.539
And the plan is to spend
a proper retirement.


1255
01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:21.459
But you know,
skiing accident in your free time,


1256
01:43:21.539 --> 01:43:23.700
thats hard to swallow.

1257
01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:37.860
We have been hoping
and hoping and hoping


1258
01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:41.860
and its true that
now time is passing


1259
01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:44.820
and we still hope, of course.

1260
01:43:44.900 --> 01:43:47.780
Bottom of my heart I really... hope.

1261
01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:54.500
Stop.

1262
01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:53.260
My daughter met a fantastic guy

1263
01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:54.900
and they decided to get married.

1264
01:44:57.420 --> 01:44:59.180
But one week before the wedding,

1265
01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:04.619
my mother fell
and hit her head very badly.


1266
01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:08.220
She was 90 years old.

1267
01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:11.860
So of course, it was panic.
We saw the doctors.


1268
01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:15.220
The doctors came into the room
with my sister


1269
01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:17.580
and showed us the x-rays and said,

1270
01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:21.180
Unfortunately, no chance.
She will not pass the night.


1271
01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:26.060
I said, Okay.

1272
01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:32.020
In the middle of the night,
she woke up. She recognized me.


1273
01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:35.340
I talked to her.
I couldnt believe it.


1274
01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:37.660
The next morning,
she started to speak,


1275
01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:40.380
to laugh with the doctors
and to be okay.


1276
01:45:40.459 --> 01:45:42.140
The doctors couldnt believe it.

1277
01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:44.980
So, for us, you know,
it was fantastic.


1278
01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:46.420
So, we continued the wedding.

1279
01:45:47.260 --> 01:45:48.660
And then she asked me,

1280
01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:50.539
Have you booked
the hairdresser for me?"


1281
01:45:50.619 --> 01:45:52.820
And she had her dress ready,
everything ready.


1282
01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:55.060
- Wow.
- And so,


1283
01:45:55.140 --> 01:45:56.300
we told her that, you know,

1284
01:45:56.380 --> 01:45:58.020
that she would come
to the wedding,


1285
01:45:58.100 --> 01:45:59.140
and maybe, you know,

1286
01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:01.539
we made her hope
that she could come.


1287
01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:04.420
And she hoped so much.

1288
01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:05.700
During the wedding,

1289
01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:09.740
her best friend came to her,
and stayed with her,


1290
01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:13.060
but she told her that
the wedding was going on


1291
01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:15.900
and she would see everything
in the wedding video.


1292
01:46:22.140 --> 01:46:24.459
The next day,
when we went to see her,


1293
01:46:24.539 --> 01:46:26.260
she had her eyes closed

1294
01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:30.300
and she let go
and she passed away.


1295
01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:35.020
She waited all the wedding,

1296
01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:39.780
To make us happy.
And it was just unbelievable.


1297
01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:41.260
We couldnt believe that.
