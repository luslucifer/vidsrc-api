1
00:00:10.217 --> 00:00:12.201
Beyond fear.

2
00:00:12.226 --> 00:00:14.351
Beyond your wildest nightmares.

3
00:01:21.843 --> 00:01:26.226
Russell, how good
to see you again.


4
00:01:49.032 --> 00:01:51.554
Dad, I got something big!

5
00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:53.007
Holy shit!

6
00:01:53.032 --> 00:01:53.835
Dad!

7
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.739
Dad!

8
00:01:54.764 --> 00:01:55.818
Dad!

9
00:01:55.946 --> 00:01:56.946
Fuck!

10
00:01:58.365 --> 00:01:59.365
Hurry!

11
00:02:01.343 --> 00:02:03.010
I think it's a body.

12
00:02:03.922 --> 00:02:06.255
That's a body, yeah.

13
00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:11.172
You got his arm?

14
00:02:15.658 --> 00:02:17.812
Pull him up.

15
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.682
- Think he's gonna be okay?
- I don't know.


16
00:02:25.707 --> 00:02:27.273
Alright, let's get
him back to camp.


17
00:02:27.298 --> 00:02:28.798
- Okay.
- Alright.


18
00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:30.907
Get him under the arm.

19
00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:41.584
Alright, let's go.

20
00:02:53.517 --> 00:02:54.517
Well?

21
00:02:55.694 --> 00:02:57.673
I don't feel a pulse.

22
00:02:57.698 --> 00:02:59.392
I think he's gone.

23
00:02:59.417 --> 00:03:01.231
Oh, God, no.

24
00:03:02.258 --> 00:03:03.449
Jesus!

25
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:10.272
Where am I?

26
00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:13.673
We just pulled you out
of the Arroyo Seco.


27
00:03:13.698 --> 00:03:15.048
Holy shit, mister!

28
00:03:15.073 --> 00:03:16.269
We thought you were dead.

29
00:03:16.294 --> 00:03:17.453
Where's the water?

30
00:03:17.478 --> 00:03:18.287
Are we close to the water?

31
00:03:18.312 --> 00:03:19.121
It's okay.

32
00:03:19.146 --> 00:03:19.955
You're safe.

33
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.814
We're a ways away.
What happened to you?


34
00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:24.634
I was in a house.

35
00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:25.931
Where?

36
00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:27.350
Ventura.

37
00:03:28.415 --> 00:03:29.998
Solar Beach colony.

38
00:03:32.522 --> 00:03:33.772
She stabbed me.

39
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.250
Who stabbed you?

40
00:03:35.275 --> 00:03:36.730
A woman.

41
00:03:36.755 --> 00:03:38.110
She killed it.

42
00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:39.261
What?

43
00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:40.935
Solar Beach, huh?

44
00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:44.572
Could he have really drifted
that far from the ocean?


45
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.507
It's possible.

46
00:03:46.532 --> 00:03:48.931
I should be under the sea.

47
00:03:48.956 --> 00:03:50.871
In R'lyeh.

48
00:03:50.896 --> 00:03:52.271
What?

49
00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:53.632
Nothing.

50
00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:55.789
Who are you?

51
00:03:55.814 --> 00:03:56.647
I'm Dan Gordon.

52
00:03:56.672 --> 00:03:58.936
This is my son Gideon,
and this is our campsite.


53
00:03:59.066 --> 00:03:59.876
Campsite?

54
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.786
Yeah, I mean, we get
out here every weekend,


55
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.726
do a little fishing.

56
00:04:03.751 --> 00:04:04.918
Who are you?

57
00:04:06.632 --> 00:04:09.200
My name is Russell Marsh.

58
00:04:09.224 --> 00:04:10.807
I was born in 1865.

59
00:04:11.982 --> 00:04:15.149
I was taken prisoner
by the light.


60
00:04:15.174 --> 00:04:17.523
September 7, 1930.

61
00:04:18.278 --> 00:04:21.862
I was 65 years old,
captaining the chase.


62
00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:27.634
A 38-footer with a three-ton
cargo of canned clams,


63
00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:29.114
and coal.

64
00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:32.102
I departed Kodiak
on Kodiak Island.


65
00:04:32.658 --> 00:04:35.662
I bound for Seward
when I saw the light.


66
00:04:35.687 --> 00:04:39.015
Look, Mr. Marsh, you
aren't making any sense.


67
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.017
You're hurt.

68
00:04:40.042 --> 00:04:41.663
You're probably in deep shock.

69
00:04:41.688 --> 00:04:45.120
I mean, you said you
were born in 1865.


70
00:04:45.144 --> 00:04:47.590
You know, you don't look

71
00:04:47.614 --> 00:04:49.544
Yeah, you're not thinking clear.

72
00:04:49.568 --> 00:04:50.618
The great Old Ones.

73
00:04:50.643 --> 00:04:52.253
They're immortal.

74
00:04:52.278 --> 00:04:55.080
I didn't age because
they were inside of me.


75
00:04:55.105 --> 00:04:57.399
They'll kill us all
when they get here.


76
00:04:57.424 --> 00:04:59.344
We have to leave, now.

77
00:04:59.369 --> 00:05:00.423
Calm down. Calm down.

78
00:05:00.448 --> 00:05:01.257
Call for an ambulance.

79
00:05:01.282 --> 00:05:02.462
- No!
- Okay, all right, alright.


80
00:05:02.487 --> 00:05:04.382
Lead us out of here
as far from the water,


81
00:05:04.407 --> 00:05:06.140
as from the water as you can.

82
00:05:06.165 --> 00:05:08.892
You'll drop me off at
some dry land, please.


83
00:05:08.917 --> 00:05:10.234
Okay.

84
00:05:12.297 --> 00:05:14.070
Keep him here.

85
00:05:14.142 --> 00:05:15.156
Keep him here.

86
00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:16.683
I'll go for help, okay?

87
00:05:16.708 --> 00:05:18.508
- They're coming.
- Nice and calm.


88
00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:20.039
Nice and calm.

89
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.251
We gotta go.

90
00:05:23.276 --> 00:05:25.109
Yeah, yeah, he is...

91
00:05:26.883 --> 00:05:29.126
Sure thing, Mr. Marsh.

92
00:05:29.151 --> 00:05:30.168
Gideon.

93
00:05:30.193 --> 00:05:31.922
Get Russell some
dry clothes here


94
00:05:31.947 --> 00:05:33.262
before he freezes to death.

95
00:05:33.287 --> 00:05:34.532
I'm gonna go get my Jeep.

96
00:05:34.556 --> 00:05:36.285
Uh, I'll bring it
closer so you don't have


97
00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:38.000
to hike too far with that gash.

98
00:05:38.025 --> 00:05:39.025
Hurry!

99
00:05:39.453 --> 00:05:40.422
I'm going.

100
00:05:40.447 --> 00:05:41.392
I'm going.

101
00:05:41.417 --> 00:05:43.493
All right, look, Russell,
I got some clothes for you.


102
00:05:43.518 --> 00:05:44.946
You can change back there.

103
00:05:44.971 --> 00:05:47.228
Oh, thank you.

104
00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:56.233
Thank you. No problem.

105
00:05:56.258 --> 00:05:59.558
All right, just,
I'll be out here.


106
00:06:00.598 --> 00:06:01.857
Yeah, hi.

107
00:06:02.155 --> 00:06:03.767
Um, goddamn rain.

108
00:06:03.792 --> 00:06:06.330
Um, my name is Dan Gordon.

109
00:06:06.354 --> 00:06:07.532
I need an ambulance.

110
00:06:07.557 --> 00:06:10.079
My son and I, yeah, hello?

111
00:06:10.588 --> 00:06:11.689
Shit.

112
00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:18.372
You're breaking up.

113
00:06:20.804 --> 00:06:21.782
You're breaking up.

114
00:06:21.807 --> 00:06:23.140
Can you hear me?

115
00:06:26.306 --> 00:06:29.556
We pull a man out of
the river and, ah!


116
00:06:33.127 --> 00:06:34.397
Dad?

117
00:06:34.842 --> 00:06:36.494
Dad!

118
00:06:48.633 --> 00:06:50.216
Run, Gideon, run!

119
00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.416
Come to me, vessel of Old Ones.

120
00:06:59.441 --> 00:07:00.852
The Old One is dead.

121
00:07:00.877 --> 00:07:04.565
That is not dead,
which can eternal lie.


122
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.369
And with strange eons,
even death may die.


123
00:07:09.394 --> 00:07:14.394
I remember seeing beneath as
far as vision could explore.


124
00:07:15.025 --> 00:07:20.017
But now my mind, my
body, are mine once more.


125
00:07:22.558 --> 00:07:23.891
Take him home.

126
00:08:43.313 --> 00:08:44.349
Wait a second.

127
00:08:44.374 --> 00:08:46.231
Hey, hey, it killed my dad.

128
00:08:46.255 --> 00:08:47.389
What the hell was it?

129
00:08:47.413 --> 00:08:51.048
The species of
ocean-dwelling humanoids.


130
00:08:51.101 --> 00:08:52.543
The Deep Ones.

131
00:08:52.568 --> 00:08:54.129
Deep, deep, species?

132
00:08:54.154 --> 00:08:57.665
The cult gave them
women to mate with


133
00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.607
in exchange for riches.

134
00:09:00.668 --> 00:09:02.622
This, this is how you're talking

135
00:09:02.647 --> 00:09:04.810
about monsters and oceans?

136
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.890
All right, all right, help me.

137
00:09:37.255 --> 00:09:39.274
Okay.

138
00:09:43.219 --> 00:09:44.802
Give me your knife.

139
00:09:47.758 --> 00:09:48.960
What for?

140
00:09:50.028 --> 00:09:53.211
The only way to kill an
Old One is with bone.


141
00:09:53.235 --> 00:09:56.404
Your gonna cut that thing up?

142
00:09:56.428 --> 00:10:00.065
We need a couple of
ribs and the head.


143
00:10:00.089 --> 00:10:02.477
This is a fucking
living nightmare, man.


144
00:10:02.502 --> 00:10:04.575
We survive nightmares.

145
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.128
Okay, wait, so what's
an Old One anyway?


146
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:11.368
The great Old Ones were
here ages before mankind,


147
00:10:11.392 --> 00:10:16.314
before man came to
this young world.


148
00:10:16.339 --> 00:10:17.422
Listen to me.

149
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:24.191
This body holds secrets, to
dreams, to us, to destroy a cult


150
00:10:24.216 --> 00:10:27.383
which once thought
it would never die.


151
00:10:50.163 --> 00:10:51.746
You all right, kid?

152
00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:56.646
I thought, you, you
said it was dead.


153
00:10:56.671 --> 00:10:58.111
It appears I was wrong.

154
00:10:58.136 --> 00:10:59.437
It's dead now.

155
00:10:59.462 --> 00:11:00.634
You sure?

156
00:11:00.659 --> 00:11:01.991
Yes.

157
00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:06.205
I can sense Finley.

158
00:11:07.285 --> 00:11:08.697
Okay, so you can sense a Finley,

159
00:11:08.722 --> 00:11:11.229
but you can't sense if
that thing is still alive.


160
00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:12.921
This is new to me.

161
00:11:13.927 --> 00:11:15.741
I sense what I sense.

162
00:11:15.766 --> 00:11:16.795
Okay, excuse me.

163
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:17.784
I didn't know.

164
00:11:17.848 --> 00:11:20.579
I can hypnotize you if
you want and, you know,


165
00:11:20.604 --> 00:11:21.883
it won't be so bad.

166
00:11:21.907 --> 00:11:22.850
No, nope.

167
00:11:22.874 --> 00:11:23.522
Thank you.

168
00:11:23.547 --> 00:11:24.860
I'm fine.

169
00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:26.861
You're a good kid, kid.

170
00:11:49.385 --> 00:11:51.188
We may need this.

171
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.507
Where's that other freakin' rib?

172
00:12:09.494 --> 00:12:11.600
There it is.

173
00:12:13.093 --> 00:12:15.069
In case it gets
inside of me again.


174
00:12:16.666 --> 00:12:17.967
Now the head.

175
00:12:20.591 --> 00:12:21.963
It's coming.

176
00:12:21.988 --> 00:12:22.988
It's coming.

177
00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:27.888
Jesus.

178
00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:29.413
Where's the car?

179
00:12:32.309 --> 00:12:33.790
Let's vamos.

180
00:12:33.898 --> 00:12:35.481
All right, come on.

181
00:12:51.939 --> 00:12:52.795
Come on!

182
00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.236
Pick up the pace.

183
00:12:55.903 --> 00:12:59.403
The ocean's full of
hybrids and Deep Ones.


184
00:13:00.355 --> 00:13:03.022
More are gonna be coming for us.

185
00:13:05.969 --> 00:13:08.826
You want to see your dad,
alive again, don't you?


186
00:13:08.851 --> 00:13:09.727
What?

187
00:13:09.752 --> 00:13:10.977
He's dead!

188
00:13:11.418 --> 00:13:12.418
So was I.

189
00:13:13.108 --> 00:13:14.557
Look at me now.

190
00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:19.318
What are you talking about?

191
00:13:22.108 --> 00:13:24.436
This can all be reversed.

192
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.493
You can see your father again.

193
00:13:26.517 --> 00:13:28.936
You don't have to be so frantic.

194
00:13:29.598 --> 00:13:32.256
I, I can be free.

195
00:13:33.719 --> 00:13:35.873
Like none of this happened.

196
00:13:36.745 --> 00:13:37.920
No, no, no, man.

197
00:13:37.945 --> 00:13:39.729
This is all too fantastic.

198
00:13:39.754 --> 00:13:41.147
I'm holding a rib.
I'm running from monsters.


199
00:13:41.172 --> 00:13:43.410
Yeah, yeah, you ain't
seen nothing yet.


200
00:13:43.827 --> 00:13:45.244
How much further?

201
00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:48.645
I mean, it should
just be up the hill,


202
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.785
but why don't we
call the police?


203
00:13:51.809 --> 00:13:54.015
And tell them what?

204
00:13:54.039 --> 00:13:56.895
Besides, they're
everywhere in every facet.


205
00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:59.580
You open your mouth
and you disappear.


206
00:13:59.604 --> 00:14:02.937
The worst of it is
you'll see the light.


207
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:06.424
What's the light?

208
00:14:08.596 --> 00:14:11.022
Pray to God you'll
never see it, kid.


209
00:14:11.047 --> 00:14:12.047
Come on.

210
00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:06.043
Nice car, kid.

211
00:15:06.216 --> 00:15:09.299
Yeah, well, it was,
it is my dad's.


212
00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:11.608
It's yours now.

213
00:15:12.725 --> 00:15:13.725
Yeah.

214
00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:18.990
Mind getting that off of it?

215
00:15:19.015 --> 00:15:20.613
All right, pop the trunk.

216
00:15:20.638 --> 00:15:21.448
It's a hatch.

217
00:15:21.473 --> 00:15:22.735
Whatever.

218
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.733
Come on, man.

219
00:15:23.758 --> 00:15:25.725
You're really sick,
you know that?


220
00:15:27.881 --> 00:15:29.506
Nice hat.

221
00:15:30.262 --> 00:15:31.072
Yeah.

222
00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:32.507
Looks great.

223
00:15:32.562 --> 00:15:33.457
Okay.

224
00:15:33.722 --> 00:15:34.722
Where to?

225
00:15:35.533 --> 00:15:36.683
Finley.

226
00:15:36.708 --> 00:15:37.708
Okay.

227
00:15:43.847 --> 00:15:45.468
Hey, Mr. Finley.

228
00:15:45.493 --> 00:15:46.784
How's it going?

229
00:15:46.809 --> 00:15:49.502
No rest for the
wicked, Mr. Carter.


230
00:15:49.527 --> 00:15:51.027
Don't I know it.

231
00:16:03.524 --> 00:16:05.389
Good to see you again, Finley.

232
00:16:07.427 --> 00:16:09.514
I thought I had felt you.

233
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:11.755
Yes.

234
00:16:11.795 --> 00:16:14.926
Still a trace of
that primordial ooze


235
00:16:14.951 --> 00:16:16.709
coursing through my veins.

236
00:16:16.734 --> 00:16:18.911
Apparently not enough.

237
00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.823
Enough to do what
has to be done.


238
00:16:21.847 --> 00:16:24.764
It doesn't have to
go this way, Russell.


239
00:16:25.549 --> 00:16:26.716
Have a seat.

240
00:16:33.431 --> 00:16:35.181
Was that necessary?

241
00:16:36.294 --> 00:16:38.266
Most definitely.

242
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:42.793
For he who passes the
gateways always wins a shadow.


243
00:16:42.817 --> 00:16:45.484
And never again can he be alone.

244
00:16:46.566 --> 00:16:50.053
Let us reunite you with
your shadow, Mr. Marsh.


245
00:16:50.078 --> 00:16:51.333
And your friend, of course.

246
00:16:51.357 --> 00:16:52.935
Never, never, never, never.

247
00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:56.170
See, time is
fleeting, Mr. Finley.


248
00:16:56.194 --> 00:17:00.131
And you're going to need to
answer some questions for me


249
00:17:01.185 --> 00:17:05.342
that only a a great
Old One can resolve.


250
00:17:06.087 --> 00:17:09.225
I cannot help you on your quest.

251
00:17:09.249 --> 00:17:12.082
I thought you would be stubborn.

252
00:17:15.963 --> 00:17:18.655
You think that frightens me?

253
00:17:20.878 --> 00:17:22.975
I will be leaving now.

254
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Hold him.

255
00:17:24.025 --> 00:17:25.483
All right, just relax, old man.

256
00:17:25.508 --> 00:17:26.951
Lift his shirt up.

257
00:17:28.514 --> 00:17:30.481
When the stars were right,

258
00:17:30.506 --> 00:17:34.559
we could plunge from world
to world through the skies.


259
00:17:34.583 --> 00:17:41.778
But when the stars were
wrong, we could not live.


260
00:17:42.174 --> 00:17:43.193
No, okay, you know what?

261
00:17:43.218 --> 00:17:44.861
Russell, he's stronger
than he looks.


262
00:17:47.175 --> 00:17:48.175
Yeah.

263
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:58.707
Yes, show Rayburn your fate.

264
00:17:59.656 --> 00:18:03.323
Fate to all the Old
Ones that cross my path.


265
00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:11.120
From his dark house in
the mighty city of R'lyeh,


266
00:18:11.145 --> 00:18:14.653
under the waters, should rise

267
00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:21.004
and bring the earth
again beneath his sway.


268
00:18:21.377 --> 00:18:23.080
What is that?

269
00:18:23.105 --> 00:18:24.272
The Old One.

270
00:18:25.144 --> 00:18:26.144
Ah.

271
00:18:27.803 --> 00:18:30.660
I'm free, free!

272
00:18:31.531 --> 00:18:34.139
You can let him go.

273
00:18:37.999 --> 00:18:40.675
Oh my God, I can't believe it.

274
00:18:40.699 --> 00:18:42.489
Thank you, Russell.

275
00:18:42.514 --> 00:18:43.514
Th...

276
00:18:45.116 --> 00:18:46.714
I'm cut.

277
00:18:46.739 --> 00:18:49.904
Just put some pressure on it.

278
00:18:49.929 --> 00:18:50.953
Of course.

279
00:18:50.978 --> 00:18:52.434
Oh, it's worth it.

280
00:18:52.459 --> 00:18:55.028
Thank you, friend,
heaven, thank you.


281
00:18:55.242 --> 00:19:00.712
You too, both of you, thank
you for my freedom, my life.


282
00:19:00.737 --> 00:19:02.436
- Okay.
- You're welcome.


283
00:19:02.461 --> 00:19:03.475
Okay.

284
00:19:03.545 --> 00:19:04.998
Now run.

285
00:19:05.226 --> 00:19:06.036
Run!

286
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:07.559
Oh yes, yes.

287
00:19:10.145 --> 00:19:11.614
I'm free!

288
00:19:15.245 --> 00:19:18.873
I thought you said we
needed him to lead the way.


289
00:19:18.897 --> 00:19:20.897
We have it right here.

290
00:19:25.544 --> 00:19:27.461
Don't look in his eyes.

291
00:19:36.689 --> 00:19:38.196
Help me!

292
00:19:38.221 --> 00:19:41.084
There you are, Mr. Finley.

293
00:19:41.128 --> 00:19:42.552
Help me!

294
00:19:43.906 --> 00:19:45.396
Help me!

295
00:19:45.734 --> 00:19:47.651
Where is Tillinghast?

296
00:19:49.534 --> 00:19:52.879
Tillinghast resonator
will not help you.


297
00:19:52.903 --> 00:19:54.529
Rejoin your time.

298
00:19:54.554 --> 00:19:55.911
Your wife.

299
00:19:55.935 --> 00:19:59.147
Your existence is
over, Russell Marsh.


300
00:19:59.171 --> 00:20:00.740
Your vessel is gone.

301
00:20:00.765 --> 00:20:04.013
Your weak mind must answer.

302
00:20:04.588 --> 00:20:06.223
Speak to me.

303
00:20:06.248 --> 00:20:08.165
Don't look in his eyes.

304
00:20:11.485 --> 00:20:13.389
Speak to me, Old One.

305
00:20:13.414 --> 00:20:14.767
Speak to me.

306
00:20:14.792 --> 00:20:18.328
You'll need the crawling chaos.

307
00:20:18.353 --> 00:20:20.115
Ah, yes.

308
00:20:20.479 --> 00:20:21.802
Nyarlathotep.

309
00:20:21.827 --> 00:20:23.489
The crawling chaos.

310
00:20:23.514 --> 00:20:24.760
We got it.

311
00:20:24.785 --> 00:20:26.143
Come on, kid.

312
00:20:26.168 --> 00:20:28.310
This is too overwhelming, man.

313
00:20:28.335 --> 00:20:31.044
The crawling chaos.

314
00:20:37.772 --> 00:20:38.772
Hey!

315
00:20:39.662 --> 00:20:40.662
Hey!

316
00:20:44.428 --> 00:20:45.428
Mr. Finley!

317
00:20:46.869 --> 00:20:48.202
Hey, Mr. Finley!

318
00:20:52.052 --> 00:20:53.268
Mr. Finley?

319
00:20:54.607 --> 00:20:55.891
Mr. Finley?

320
00:20:58.361 --> 00:20:59.944
Help me!

321
00:21:05.171 --> 00:21:07.171
What in the holy heck?

322
00:21:11.784 --> 00:21:12.926
What is.

323
00:21:12.951 --> 00:21:14.599
Help me!

324
00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:24.148
Let go!

325
00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:26.724
What are you doing?

326
00:21:26.749 --> 00:21:27.997
Let go!

327
00:21:28.106 --> 00:21:30.306
What are you doing?

328
00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:31.646
It's too late.

329
00:21:31.671 --> 00:21:33.255
There's not enough left.

330
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.783
I am the authority of this yard.

331
00:21:35.808 --> 00:21:38.405
And if you don't
let me go right now,


332
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.591
I am gonna fuck you up, ugh.

333
00:22:30.833 --> 00:22:31.833
He lives.

334
00:22:34.268 --> 00:22:35.620
He lives. I'm Finley.

335
00:22:35.645 --> 00:22:36.692
Help me up.

336
00:22:36.997 --> 00:22:38.383
Get me to my feet.

337
00:22:38.408 --> 00:22:39.262
Help him up.

338
00:22:39.287 --> 00:22:40.185
Help him up.

339
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:41.145
Guys, get him up.

340
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.669
Help me to my feet.

341
00:22:50.546 --> 00:22:52.458
Lagrasse.

342
00:22:52.999 --> 00:22:54.256
Old friend.

343
00:22:54.281 --> 00:22:55.281
Old friend.

344
00:23:00.104 --> 00:23:00.914
Listen.

345
00:23:00.939 --> 00:23:02.380
Listen.

346
00:23:02.405 --> 00:23:04.326
Listen to my new voice.

347
00:23:04.351 --> 00:23:05.828
Yes.

348
00:23:06.095 --> 00:23:07.030
Look.

349
00:23:07.055 --> 00:23:09.326
Look at my new body.

350
00:23:11.518 --> 00:23:12.742
Glorious.

351
00:23:12.767 --> 00:23:14.216
Hail the Great Old One.

352
00:23:14.241 --> 00:23:17.974
- Hail the Great Old One.
- Hail the Great Old One.


353
00:23:18.499 --> 00:23:19.593
Glorious.

354
00:23:19.618 --> 00:23:20.622
Glorious.

355
00:23:20.647 --> 00:23:22.521
Hail the Great Old One.

356
00:23:22.546 --> 00:23:24.107
Hail the Glorious.

357
00:23:24.132 --> 00:23:25.536
Hail the Great Old One.

358
00:23:25.561 --> 00:23:27.759
Hail the Great Old One.

359
00:23:27.784 --> 00:23:31.831
- Hail the Great Old One.
- Hail the Great Old One.


360
00:23:33.674 --> 00:23:36.007
- What's going on- 
- Shut up!

361
00:23:37.306 --> 00:23:39.028
We must go.

362
00:23:39.208 --> 00:23:40.865
We must go.

363
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:43.247
To Naya.

364
00:23:44.128 --> 00:23:45.722
To Naya
-What?

365
00:23:45.747 --> 00:23:46.865
No!

366
00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:48.322
Hotep!

367
00:23:48.347 --> 00:23:49.570
Yes, let's go.

368
00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.058
Nyarlathotep!

369
00:23:52.083 --> 00:23:53.521
Nyarlathotep!

370
00:23:53.546 --> 00:23:55.038
Nyarlathotep!

371
00:25:22.042 --> 00:25:23.042
Emily?

372
00:25:23.654 --> 00:25:25.154
Russell?

373
00:25:28.333 --> 00:25:30.271
Emily.

374
00:25:30.612 --> 00:25:33.238
Why did you leave me?

375
00:25:42.193 --> 00:25:43.693
It took me away.

376
00:25:45.625 --> 00:25:46.966
The light.

377
00:25:46.991 --> 00:25:49.824
It lived inside
me for a lifetime.


378
00:25:56.439 --> 00:26:00.036
Committing unearthly sins.

379
00:26:00.061 --> 00:26:03.903
I died alone, in
darkness waiting.


380
00:26:04.249 --> 00:26:07.630
I'm crossing an ocean of time.

381
00:26:07.719 --> 00:26:11.863
Beyond the bounds
of infinity for you.


382
00:26:14.073 --> 00:26:17.974
In his house, dead
Cthulhu waits dreaming.


383
00:26:17.999 --> 00:26:18.928
Emily.

384
00:26:18.953 --> 00:26:21.911
Dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.

385
00:26:23.114 --> 00:26:24.580
Emily.

386
00:26:24.605 --> 00:26:26.567
- What is it?
- Huh?


387
00:26:27.153 --> 00:26:28.614
Nowhere to go.

388
00:26:28.639 --> 00:26:30.250
Nowhere to hide.

389
00:26:30.287 --> 00:26:33.162
His essence within resides.

390
00:26:36.163 --> 00:26:38.075
- Emily.
- Jesus, Russell.


391
00:26:38.435 --> 00:26:39.435
What is it?

392
00:26:39.705 --> 00:26:40.705
Stop.

393
00:26:42.396 --> 00:26:43.885
Where are we?

394
00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:45.862
We're about 20
miles from Castaic.


395
00:26:45.887 --> 00:26:47.444
That's where you
wanted to go, right?


396
00:26:47.469 --> 00:26:48.469
Yeah.

397
00:26:49.675 --> 00:26:52.060
Man, you were you
were out like a light.


398
00:26:52.085 --> 00:26:56.489
Starting to feel these
century old bones, I guess.


399
00:26:56.888 --> 00:26:58.713
Any place for food?

400
00:26:59.682 --> 00:27:02.669
I mean, yeah, it
should be up ahead.


401
00:27:02.694 --> 00:27:03.764
Good.

402
00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:05.502
Who's Emily?

403
00:27:05.527 --> 00:27:06.914
My wife.

404
00:27:07.739 --> 00:27:10.400
I see her in my dreams.

405
00:27:10.425 --> 00:27:14.544
Those eyes, voice, touch.

406
00:27:15.516 --> 00:27:19.874
Can't imagine the torture
being without her.


407
00:27:19.899 --> 00:27:25.528
My solace is in the

408
00:27:28.555 --> 00:27:31.008
knowing that one day
I'm going to rejoin her.


409
00:27:31.033 --> 00:27:34.533
Listen, I mean, when
my mom died, my dad


410
00:27:35.641 --> 00:27:38.187
and I became really close.

411
00:27:38.212 --> 00:27:39.411
Hell, during my whole childhood,

412
00:27:39.436 --> 00:27:42.830
I said maybe 10
words to the man.


413
00:27:43.212 --> 00:27:45.499
Now we're inseparable.

414
00:27:45.524 --> 00:27:49.880
So I can't really
comprehend that he's gone.


415
00:27:53.773 --> 00:27:56.951
I never even told
him that I loved him.


416
00:27:57.427 --> 00:27:58.844
He can't be dead.

417
00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:01.856
That's why I must believe
with all my heart,


418
00:28:01.881 --> 00:28:05.458
as fantastic as
all this may seem,


419
00:28:05.483 --> 00:28:08.702
that we'll be able
to do what you say


420
00:28:08.727 --> 00:28:11.583
and bring him back, right?

421
00:28:22.621 --> 00:28:24.704
Must believe that, right?

422
00:28:45.972 --> 00:28:49.690
♪ I'm a little cowgirl ♪

423
00:28:49.878 --> 00:28:51.282
Yeah.

424
00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:52.885
There we go.

425
00:28:55.169 --> 00:28:58.013
Got fries.

426
00:28:58.038 --> 00:29:00.734
You got apple pie and ice cream?

427
00:29:00.824 --> 00:29:03.528
Um, I got to check.

428
00:29:03.553 --> 00:29:06.002
I think we ran out
of apple pie, but.


429
00:29:06.027 --> 00:29:07.668
Cherry pie?

430
00:29:07.693 --> 00:29:09.711
Come on, you didn't
earn cherry pie.


431
00:29:09.736 --> 00:29:11.403
I like cherry pie.

432
00:29:14.973 --> 00:29:15.898
Hmm.

433
00:29:16.117 --> 00:29:19.411
Hey, uh, what's with the tattoo?

434
00:29:21.575 --> 00:29:23.515
If I had a nickel
for every time.


435
00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:27.544
Why do horses chew
with their mouths open?


436
00:29:27.568 --> 00:29:29.751
Because they have
bad stable manners.


437
00:29:33.104 --> 00:29:37.606
Seriously, you see
someone with one of these,


438
00:29:38.501 --> 00:29:39.501
run.

439
00:29:44.703 --> 00:29:46.207
Hey.

440
00:29:46.232 --> 00:29:47.565
Them folks okay?

441
00:29:49.911 --> 00:29:52.181
You know, you keep
keeping me on till six,


442
00:29:52.206 --> 00:29:54.348
I'm going to fucking
quit, or I need,


443
00:29:54.373 --> 00:29:58.997
I need, I need time
for my, just for me.


444
00:29:59.023 --> 00:30:00.557
Me time.

445
00:30:00.582 --> 00:30:01.707
Okay?

446
00:30:01.732 --> 00:30:02.544
That's fine.

447
00:30:02.569 --> 00:30:04.956
I'm, I'm just cranky.

448
00:30:04.981 --> 00:30:06.587
I think so.

449
00:30:06.612 --> 00:30:08.927
So we're safe then.

450
00:30:08.952 --> 00:30:10.920
For the moment.

451
00:30:10.945 --> 00:30:11.945
Super.

452
00:30:13.001 --> 00:30:14.575
This is fantastic.

453
00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.009
Hmm?

454
00:30:16.034 --> 00:30:17.315
Hmm.

455
00:30:17.782 --> 00:30:21.435
I've been eating nothing but
seafood for the last 90 years.


456
00:30:22.927 --> 00:30:24.342
Yuck.

457
00:30:24.367 --> 00:30:26.822
Oh, I'm glad you're enjoying it.

458
00:30:26.846 --> 00:30:28.446
Now, would you mind filling
me in on what we're doing here


459
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:30.974
and how this will help
bring back my dad?


460
00:30:30.998 --> 00:30:36.013
We're going to go
see, uh, Nyarlathotep.


461
00:30:39.079 --> 00:30:40.329
What is that?

462
00:30:43.091 --> 00:30:44.530
You mean who?

463
00:30:45.718 --> 00:30:48.051
Okay, who is Nyarlathotep?

464
00:30:48.818 --> 00:30:50.318
From inner Egypt

465
00:30:52.062 --> 00:30:58.075
came the strange dark
one to whom fellas bowed.


466
00:31:00.836 --> 00:31:09.237
Wain and silent, wrapped in
fabrics, red like sunset flame.


467
00:31:09.642 --> 00:31:14.628
Throngs, they've had a frown.

468
00:31:15.706 --> 00:31:21.495
Frantic for his commands.

469
00:31:21.969 --> 00:31:26.706
But leaving could not
tell what they heard.


470
00:31:28.839 --> 00:31:31.839
While, through the nations,

471
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.333
the word spread,

472
00:31:35.853 --> 00:31:38.963
wild beasts followed him,

473
00:31:39.973 --> 00:31:41.473
licking his hands.

474
00:31:44.894 --> 00:31:46.727
And soon from the sea,

475
00:31:49.219 --> 00:31:53.393
this noxious world began.

476
00:31:54.923 --> 00:31:57.104
Forgotten lands.

477
00:31:57.891 --> 00:32:00.487
Weighty spires of gold.

478
00:32:03.252 --> 00:32:06.585
So, so he's some
kind of prophet then?


479
00:32:07.227 --> 00:32:08.227
Sort of.

480
00:32:09.099 --> 00:32:11.430
So, so, so he's good?

481
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:15.612
No, as evil as they come.

482
00:32:19.078 --> 00:32:22.245
Well, then, so why
would he help us?


483
00:32:30.076 --> 00:32:30.999
This is why.

484
00:32:31.024 --> 00:32:34.242
Jesus, Jesus, some discretion.

485
00:32:34.267 --> 00:32:35.267
No.

486
00:32:36.491 --> 00:32:39.324
That's our golden
fleece, sort of.


487
00:32:40.632 --> 00:32:42.215
That's the heart?

488
00:32:43.324 --> 00:32:48.085
Hopefully, Nyarlathotep
will be happy


489
00:32:48.414 --> 00:32:51.164
to exchange
information for that.


490
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:56.477
And how will this information
bring my dad back?


491
00:32:59.352 --> 00:33:02.352
He knows where to
find Tillingast.


492
00:33:03.096 --> 00:33:03.906
Okay.

493
00:33:03.931 --> 00:33:10.191
And Tillingast's machine, the
resonator, will open doors.


494
00:33:10.216 --> 00:33:13.465
It's going to take
me back to 1930,


495
00:33:14.588 --> 00:33:16.838
the day before I was taken.

496
00:33:18.167 --> 00:33:22.917
Hence, I won't go
on my boat to chase.


497
00:33:23.145 --> 00:33:25.288
And therefore, I
won't see the light,


498
00:33:25.313 --> 00:33:28.918
so they won't be
able to inhabit me.


499
00:33:30.756 --> 00:33:35.973
And you won't pick me
up at the river's edge.


500
00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:41.829
I got it.

501
00:33:41.854 --> 00:33:43.191
Oh, fuck.

502
00:33:43.262 --> 00:33:45.613
Whoa.

503
00:33:46.132 --> 00:33:46.941
What?

504
00:33:46.966 --> 00:33:47.776
You okay?

505
00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.387
Is it your wound?

506
00:33:49.412 --> 00:33:51.434
Hamburgers.

507
00:33:52.699 --> 00:33:54.130
Oh.

508
00:33:54.155 --> 00:33:55.667
Yeah, you need some
metamucil or something?


509
00:33:55.691 --> 00:33:58.043
I'm sure we can get some.

510
00:33:58.068 --> 00:33:58.877
Excuse me.

511
00:33:58.902 --> 00:34:00.160
Okay. Yeah.

512
00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:07.559
Hey, is everything
okay with your friend?


513
00:34:07.584 --> 00:34:08.499
Oh, yeah.

514
00:34:08.524 --> 00:34:09.207
He's fine.

515
00:34:09.232 --> 00:34:11.707
I think he just ate a little
too fast or something.


516
00:34:11.732 --> 00:34:15.047
It probably Phil's
fucking cooking.


517
00:34:15.072 --> 00:34:17.594
You know, some of the clam
chowder and wine hasn't agreed


518
00:34:17.619 --> 00:34:20.708
with all the customers, so
I just wouldn't eat too many


519
00:34:20.733 --> 00:34:22.951
of those fries otherwise, ugh!

520
00:34:22.976 --> 00:34:24.460
Yeah, I got it.

521
00:34:24.485 --> 00:34:25.485
Thanks.

522
00:34:26.076 --> 00:34:28.010
Oh, can I get a check

523
00:34:28.035 --> 00:34:31.035
and a to-go box?
Yeah, you got it.


524
00:34:45.973 --> 00:34:46.973
Oh.

525
00:34:54.877 --> 00:34:55.877
Gideon?

526
00:35:01.351 --> 00:35:02.895
I'll be right out.

527
00:35:16.846 --> 00:35:18.763
We have him.

528
00:35:20.082 --> 00:35:21.392
Soggoth!

529
00:35:23.441 --> 00:35:25.882
He's in the can
taking a growler.


530
00:35:25.907 --> 00:35:27.691
I'll get him. What?

531
00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:31.499
He's in, he's in the bathroom.

532
00:35:31.524 --> 00:35:34.623
Get him while he's vulnerable.

533
00:35:35.606 --> 00:35:37.387
Soggoth.

534
00:35:37.412 --> 00:35:40.750
Crush Russell's throat.

535
00:35:40.775 --> 00:35:42.290
Yes, it has it.

536
00:35:42.315 --> 00:35:43.125
Yes.

537
00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:45.406
What's happening to me?

538
00:35:45.431 --> 00:35:46.241
Leave me alone.

539
00:35:46.266 --> 00:35:47.942
I told you he was too damaged.

540
00:35:47.967 --> 00:35:48.967
I told you.

541
00:35:53.738 --> 00:35:56.606
I told you the Old
One was too damaged.


542
00:35:56.631 --> 00:35:57.631
I'm back.

543
00:35:57.929 --> 00:36:01.762
While you evacuate your poison,

544
00:36:01.787 --> 00:36:03.182
I'm going to crush you.

545
00:36:03.207 --> 00:36:04.484
This isn't right.

546
00:36:05.004 --> 00:36:07.098
Hold on.

547
00:36:08.751 --> 00:36:11.108
He's a fucking liar.

548
00:36:11.133 --> 00:36:12.942
Shut the fuck up
and concentrate.


549
00:36:12.966 --> 00:36:15.893
- Okay, okay.
- Soggoth.


550
00:36:15.918 --> 00:36:17.060
Soggoth.

551
00:36:17.084 --> 00:36:18.684
Ah, that's, a good Soggoth.

552
00:36:18.709 --> 00:36:19.519
Get him.

553
00:36:19.544 --> 00:36:20.747
Get Russell.

554
00:36:20.772 --> 00:36:22.315
Get him by the throat.

555
00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.840
Tekeli-li!

556
00:36:26.652 --> 00:36:27.652
Tekeli-li!

557
00:36:48.342 --> 00:36:50.711
Up to your old
tricks, huh, Finley?


558
00:37:29.424 --> 00:37:30.807
Gideon!

559
00:37:30.832 --> 00:37:31.832
Gideon!

560
00:37:36.446 --> 00:37:38.123
Russell Marsh.

561
00:37:38.148 --> 00:37:40.021
You won't escape.

562
00:37:40.293 --> 00:37:41.925
I'm in control!

563
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:43.309
I see you.

564
00:37:43.334 --> 00:37:44.975
I see you.

565
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:49.150
Clam chowder and
wine, this early?


566
00:37:54.101 --> 00:37:56.832
Been eating nothing
but seafood and wine


567
00:37:56.857 --> 00:37:59.859
for 90 years, seafood and wine.

568
00:37:59.884 --> 00:38:01.162
Shit.

569
00:38:09.046 --> 00:38:09.855
Russell.

570
00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.689
Gideon!

571
00:38:10.714 --> 00:38:11.441
Gideon!

572
00:38:11.466 --> 00:38:13.208
What do I do?

573
00:38:13.233 --> 00:38:14.043
Salt.

574
00:38:14.068 --> 00:38:15.528
Get some salt.

575
00:38:15.553 --> 00:38:16.797
Oh, okay.

576
00:38:16.821 --> 00:38:17.631
Hang on.

577
00:38:17.655 --> 00:38:19.152
I don't think these
guys are paying.


578
00:38:19.177 --> 00:38:20.233
Hey, fry guy.

579
00:38:20.258 --> 00:38:21.573
I left a check on the table.

580
00:38:21.598 --> 00:38:22.590
You going to pay?

581
00:38:22.615 --> 00:38:24.210
Yeah, about that, um.

582
00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:26.199
What are you doing, dude?

583
00:38:26.224 --> 00:38:27.262
My friend has a
really upset stomach.


584
00:38:27.287 --> 00:38:28.658
I promise I'll write you
a check or something.


585
00:38:28.683 --> 00:38:30.393
Probably your fault because
of the clam chowder.


586
00:38:30.418 --> 00:38:31.297
Hey, Phil.

587
00:38:31.322 --> 00:38:32.906
We got some weird
ones today, man.


588
00:38:32.931 --> 00:38:33.824
Okay, Russell.

589
00:38:33.854 --> 00:38:34.709
I got the salt.

590
00:38:34.734 --> 00:38:36.114
What do I do?

591
00:38:36.139 --> 00:38:37.113
What do I do?

592
00:38:37.138 --> 00:38:39.430
Throw it at him.

593
00:38:39.616 --> 00:38:40.949
Okay.

594
00:38:48.441 --> 00:38:49.907
Hurry!

595
00:39:05.391 --> 00:39:06.711
Ahh!

596
00:39:06.828 --> 00:39:08.524
It feels like I'm on fire.

597
00:39:08.549 --> 00:39:09.986
Ugh!

598
00:39:13.641 --> 00:39:14.641
Ahh!

599
00:39:28.312 --> 00:39:33.312
Soggoth, dead!

600
00:39:41.014 --> 00:39:43.597
Ah, ugh!

601
00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:02.027
Oh, God.

602
00:40:02.116 --> 00:40:02.928
Russell.

603
00:40:03.209 --> 00:40:05.330
Holy shit, Russell,
are you okay?


604
00:40:05.355 --> 00:40:06.938
Yeah, I think so.

605
00:40:08.334 --> 00:40:09.727
Jesus.

606
00:40:11.234 --> 00:40:12.852
Poor bastard never
saw it coming.


607
00:40:12.877 --> 00:40:13.877
Yeah.

608
00:40:15.688 --> 00:40:16.859
Got company.

609
00:40:16.884 --> 00:40:17.694
Oh, God.

610
00:40:17.719 --> 00:40:19.164
Uh, huh, um,

611
00:40:19.189 --> 00:40:21.801
we can explain what this is.

612
00:40:21.826 --> 00:40:24.650
It's, um, tell them what it is.

613
00:40:24.675 --> 00:40:26.206
It's a Soggoth.

614
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:29.287
Yes, a Soggoth, which occurs

615
00:40:29.312 --> 00:40:32.636
when certain atmospheric
pressures mixed with swamp gases.


616
00:40:32.661 --> 00:40:34.916
They bond to create a fungus.

617
00:40:34.941 --> 00:40:36.862
This is kind of really
a health code violation.


618
00:40:36.887 --> 00:40:38.082
This is your fault.

619
00:40:44.235 --> 00:40:49.019
You hear only my voice,
my control, my thoughts.


620
00:40:52.896 --> 00:40:54.637
I hear only you.

621
00:40:58.484 --> 00:40:59.484
Step back.

622
00:41:00.599 --> 00:41:01.894
Step back.

623
00:41:06.188 --> 00:41:07.870
You hypnotized them.

624
00:41:07.895 --> 00:41:09.582
Pretty cool, huh?

625
00:41:09.607 --> 00:41:11.626
Finley's out there.

626
00:41:12.117 --> 00:41:14.027
Wait, the guy from the office?

627
00:41:14.052 --> 00:41:18.135
The Old One that was in
him is in someone else.


628
00:41:18.965 --> 00:41:20.986
Yeah, controlled the Soggoth.

629
00:41:21.011 --> 00:41:22.150
Okay, you know, whatever.

630
00:41:22.175 --> 00:41:24.012
Why hypnotize them?

631
00:41:24.037 --> 00:41:25.480
They gotta help us.

632
00:41:25.505 --> 00:41:27.063
- Help us?
- Yeah, distraction.


633
00:41:27.087 --> 00:41:30.058
How will they come out
of it when we're gone?


634
00:41:30.083 --> 00:41:34.569
Um, any loud noise or snap
brings them right back.


635
00:41:34.728 --> 00:41:37.069
They'll be right as rain.

636
00:41:37.094 --> 00:41:39.035
Okay, well, I don't
like the sound of that.


637
00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.234
Well, trust me.

638
00:41:41.259 --> 00:41:45.259
Okay, back out, back out.

639
00:41:45.462 --> 00:41:48.212
Back out.

640
00:41:51.843 --> 00:41:53.205
Oh, God.

641
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:56.563
Russell comes.

642
00:42:00.604 --> 00:42:01.604
Oh, God.

643
00:42:03.085 --> 00:42:04.466
I'll see what they want.

644
00:42:04.491 --> 00:42:05.574
Wait, wait.

645
00:42:07.184 --> 00:42:09.184
Russell's controlling them.

646
00:42:09.209 --> 00:42:11.777
Howdy folks, I'm
Constable LaGrasse.


647
00:42:11.824 --> 00:42:13.801
I'm here to speak to a
couple of your patrons


648
00:42:13.826 --> 00:42:15.961
in your establishment.

649
00:42:15.986 --> 00:42:18.951
There's no one in
there, Constable.


650
00:42:18.976 --> 00:42:22.172
There's no one in
there, Constable.


651
00:42:25.965 --> 00:42:28.240
Hey, Russell, I hate to
disrupt your singing,


652
00:42:28.265 --> 00:42:30.380
but who the hell are they?

653
00:42:30.405 --> 00:42:33.822
Members of the Esoteric
Order of Dagon.


654
00:42:35.717 --> 00:42:39.277
It looks like Finley
is now in that fella


655
00:42:39.302 --> 00:42:41.135
in the passenger seat.

656
00:42:42.688 --> 00:42:46.048
The bald guy in the
back, he's a hybrid.


657
00:42:46.073 --> 00:42:50.174
We take out Finley and
we'll be all right.


658
00:42:50.199 --> 00:42:52.589
And the cop?

659
00:42:52.614 --> 00:42:57.416
Him and Cabby are
just human disciples.


660
00:42:57.895 --> 00:43:00.809
They gave their women to
mate with the Deep Ones


661
00:43:00.834 --> 00:43:03.751
in exchange for gold.

662
00:43:06.853 --> 00:43:08.845
Wait a second, they're
not gonna hurt Phil


663
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:10.620
and Nadine, are they?

664
00:43:11.554 --> 00:43:12.663
You're gonna have to step aside.

665
00:43:12.688 --> 00:43:14.869
I'm gonna have to
see it for myself.


666
00:43:17.581 --> 00:43:18.664
Wait, wait!

667
00:43:26.232 --> 00:43:27.565
Roll the window!

668
00:43:31.744 --> 00:43:33.743
No, roll it up.

669
00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:41.946
Oh my God!

670
00:43:45.153 --> 00:43:48.056
Russell says, die motherfucker!

671
00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.224
- Hey, I'm Finley.
- Die, Finley.


672
00:43:54.249 --> 00:43:55.392
Watch out!

673
00:44:16.721 --> 00:44:20.369
I'm sorry, Legrasse, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry, oh my god,


674
00:44:20.394 --> 00:44:21.394
oh my god.

675
00:44:24.834 --> 00:44:26.286
Let's go.

676
00:44:46.829 --> 00:44:48.329
Whoa!

677
00:44:49.149 --> 00:44:51.697
Poor Reeves.

678
00:44:53.613 --> 00:44:54.939
Get out of my body!

679
00:44:54.964 --> 00:44:57.112
Shut up, human!

680
00:44:57.137 --> 00:45:00.634
This is my body now!

681
00:45:01.834 --> 00:45:04.601
And there are vocal qualities.

682
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:07.255
- Fuck.
- But you're the beast,


683
00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.196
and it is terrible

684
00:45:09.221 --> 00:45:12.900
to hear one when the
source of yield the other.


685
00:45:12.931 --> 00:45:13.853
Let's go!

686
00:45:13.878 --> 00:45:14.688
Okay!

687
00:45:14.713 --> 00:45:16.770
Russell dies tonight!

688
00:45:29.594 --> 00:45:31.502
You're sitting there like
we just had a nice meal


689
00:45:31.527 --> 00:45:35.760
like some pasta or pizza or
something and left like nothing.


690
00:45:35.785 --> 00:45:37.705
They were real people
with consciousness


691
00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:39.276
and you took it away
basically for your own thing.


692
00:45:39.301 --> 00:45:42.273
Yeah, sure, give them
a hypnotic suggestion


693
00:45:42.298 --> 00:45:43.841
of overwhelming joy.

694
00:45:43.866 --> 00:45:44.939
Hypnotic suggestion?

695
00:45:44.964 --> 00:45:46.884
When they come out
of it, all right?


696
00:45:46.909 --> 00:45:49.826
You're really kind
of an asshole.


697
00:45:51.399 --> 00:45:55.722
You wanna see a glimpse
of the unspeakable horrors


698
00:45:55.747 --> 00:45:58.421
that I was subjected to?

699
00:45:58.455 --> 00:45:59.853
Why are you looking at me like,

700
00:45:59.878 --> 00:46:01.814
what are you talking about?

701
00:46:03.712 --> 00:46:08.580
The clawing, the
scratching, the biting.


702
00:46:18.221 --> 00:46:21.916
The convulsive,
epileptic madness.


703
00:46:22.908 --> 00:46:25.666
The noxious air.

704
00:46:26.416 --> 00:46:29.876
The yelling, the screaming,

705
00:46:30.562 --> 00:46:34.080
the struggling, the struggling

706
00:46:34.105 --> 00:46:39.986
in her madness, in the madness,
in the dark, dark blackness.


707
00:46:42.074 --> 00:46:46.157
Stop! Stop, stop!

708
00:46:48.203 --> 00:46:49.320
I'm sorry.

709
00:46:49.391 --> 00:46:50.391
I'm sorry.

710
00:46:54.887 --> 00:46:56.844
Please, let's just go.

711
00:46:56.869 --> 00:46:58.314
No.

712
00:46:58.744 --> 00:47:00.249
Why not?

713
00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:04.142
We actually missed the turn off.

714
00:47:07.047 --> 00:47:07.941
Shit.

715
00:47:07.966 --> 00:47:09.416
Asshole.

716
00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.002
Oh, stupid humans.

717
00:47:47.026 --> 00:47:52.181
Stupid humans, faster!

718
00:47:54.852 --> 00:47:55.852
Stop.

719
00:47:56.369 --> 00:47:57.817
Okay.

720
00:47:58.721 --> 00:48:00.869
Don't listen to that, Buck.

721
00:48:00.894 --> 00:48:03.556
I said stop the car.

722
00:48:04.087 --> 00:48:06.220
Well, well, which is it?

723
00:48:06.245 --> 00:48:07.853
Drive, slave.

724
00:48:10.316 --> 00:48:13.017
Hey, how you doing, buddy?

725
00:48:13.672 --> 00:48:16.314
Okay, okay, okay, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry, Lagrasse.


726
00:48:16.339 --> 00:48:19.831
I, I do, I feel really bad.

727
00:48:20.035 --> 00:48:23.701
Yeah, dude, we all
feel so fucking bad.


728
00:48:23.733 --> 00:48:29.102
Now shut the fuck up,
I gotta concentrate.


729
00:48:31.643 --> 00:48:35.393
Well, how can you track
him without Reeves?


730
00:48:35.755 --> 00:48:38.103
I mean, can you see him?

731
00:48:38.128 --> 00:48:39.103
Huh?

732
00:48:39.128 --> 00:48:40.346
Or smell 'em?

733
00:48:40.371 --> 00:48:41.838
- I smell him.
- Okay.


734
00:48:41.863 --> 00:48:44.150
I smell him, can you smell him?

735
00:48:44.175 --> 00:48:45.175
He is.

736
00:48:45.934 --> 00:48:47.355
I don't smell anything.

737
00:48:47.449 --> 00:48:48.570
This way!

738
00:48:48.595 --> 00:48:50.289
You're on the right track.

739
00:48:50.314 --> 00:48:51.556
We're getting close.

740
00:48:51.581 --> 00:48:53.267
- Okay.
- We're getting close.


741
00:48:59.484 --> 00:49:00.294
There!

742
00:49:00.319 --> 00:49:01.368
Turn here! Okay, okay, okay,

743
00:49:01.393 --> 00:49:03.143
all right, all right.

744
00:49:05.824 --> 00:49:07.649
I mean, it almost
sounds like you've been


745
00:49:07.674 --> 00:49:10.126
through this before,
did you ever have to.


746
00:49:10.151 --> 00:49:13.963
It's the first time for me.

747
00:49:14.408 --> 00:49:16.241
Always the first time.

748
00:49:22.561 --> 00:49:24.345
I didn't know I
had another gear.


749
00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:27.215
Yeah, it has one.

750
00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:29.073
It's for going uphill.

751
00:49:30.338 --> 00:49:32.005
Oh, man.

752
00:49:44.371 --> 00:49:46.110
God, do you even know,

753
00:49:46.135 --> 00:49:48.298
do you even know
where we're going?


754
00:49:48.323 --> 00:49:50.740
Yeah, yeah, I do.

755
00:49:53.645 --> 00:49:55.135
Neverland.

756
00:49:55.236 --> 00:49:56.328
Neverland.

757
00:49:56.353 --> 00:49:58.644
So it's like the land
you'll never come back.


758
00:50:00.976 --> 00:50:05.978
This doesn't even look
like it's part of the road.


759
00:50:06.003 --> 00:50:08.824
Heading off into
uncharted territory.


760
00:50:08.849 --> 00:50:12.516
It's off the beaten
path, that's for sure.


761
00:50:22.535 --> 00:50:25.475
You gotta be kidding me.

762
00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:27.250
A prophet lives here?

763
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:31.728
You know, looks can
be deceiving, kid.


764
00:50:31.753 --> 00:50:33.170
Yeah, I'm sure.

765
00:50:37.825 --> 00:50:38.825
There.

766
00:50:41.312 --> 00:50:42.312
Wow.

767
00:50:45.143 --> 00:50:47.976
Where the small hours were rent,

768
00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:52.822
with screams of nightmare.

769
00:50:55.355 --> 00:50:58.744
Hey, well, I think I saw
something over there.


770
00:50:58.769 --> 00:51:03.135
Yeah, probably his followers,
they don't like sunlight.


771
00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.813
What, are they vampires?

772
00:51:06.395 --> 00:51:07.978
Ghasts, actually.

773
00:51:09.464 --> 00:51:12.950
Great, I'm sure
they're much worse.


774
00:51:12.974 --> 00:51:15.913
Yeah, unwholesome creatures.

775
00:51:18.672 --> 00:51:24.226
When long ago, the
gods created Earth


776
00:51:27.177 --> 00:51:29.554
in Jove's fair image

777
00:51:30.781 --> 00:51:33.507
and man was shaped at birth,

778
00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:39.960
the beasts for lesser
parts were next designed,


779
00:51:42.804 --> 00:51:48.804
yet, were they too
remote for humankind.


780
00:51:52.099 --> 00:51:55.682
To fill the gap and
join the rest of man,


781
00:51:56.922 --> 00:52:01.109
the Olympian host
conceived a clever plan.


782
00:52:01.997 --> 00:52:06.445
A beast they wrought
in semi-human figure,


783
00:52:07.367 --> 00:52:14.546
filled it with vice, and
called the thing a nigger.


784
00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:30.315
Did you hear that, children?

785
00:52:37.305 --> 00:52:41.041
Only a human with the
slightest trace of the Old One


786
00:52:41.066 --> 00:52:43.913
lingering in his withered veins

787
00:52:43.938 --> 00:52:46.355
would utter that verse to me.

788
00:52:47.528 --> 00:52:49.504
I knew that would
get your attention.


789
00:52:49.528 --> 00:52:54.361
Yes, you roused my ebony skin
beautifully, Russell Mash.


790
00:52:58.826 --> 00:53:00.076
Nyarlathotep.

791
00:53:02.037 --> 00:53:07.361
Mighty messenger, must
all things be told.


792
00:53:08.798 --> 00:53:15.917
He shall take on the semblance
of man, the waxen mask,


793
00:53:15.942 --> 00:53:21.291
the robes that hide, and
come down from the world


794
00:53:21.316 --> 00:53:23.822
of seven suns to mock.

795
00:53:24.266 --> 00:53:26.849
Oh, you speak his words well.

796
00:53:27.851 --> 00:53:28.851
Rise.

797
00:53:32.288 --> 00:53:34.205
What do you wish of me?

798
00:53:35.449 --> 00:53:38.199
We're in search of Tillinghast.

799
00:53:39.072 --> 00:53:42.207
You think you can revert time?

800
00:53:42.232 --> 00:53:43.327
I must try.

801
00:53:43.483 --> 00:53:48.373
And what makes you think
I won't destroy you both


802
00:53:48.397 --> 00:53:53.252
or have my ghasts feast
on your blood and bone?


803
00:53:53.976 --> 00:53:56.393
I offer you this.

804
00:53:58.199 --> 00:53:59.431
Leftovers?

805
00:54:00.237 --> 00:54:01.237
Oh, sorry.

806
00:54:06.685 --> 00:54:08.240
A Deep One?

807
00:54:08.265 --> 00:54:09.075
Yes.

808
00:54:09.411 --> 00:54:11.985
May be of some use to me.

809
00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:17.838
But it hardly seems fair
considering there are two of you.


810
00:54:18.114 --> 00:54:19.453
Well, you know, I can
just go back to the car,


811
00:54:19.478 --> 00:54:21.306
My ghasts will feast on you now.

812
00:54:21.331 --> 00:54:22.406
Whoa, hey, wait a second.

813
00:54:22.431 --> 00:54:23.240
Hey, hey, hey.

814
00:54:23.265 --> 00:54:24.074
No, no.

815
00:54:24.099 --> 00:54:25.180
Stay away.

816
00:54:25.205 --> 00:54:27.321
Don't be foolish, kid.

817
00:54:27.792 --> 00:54:28.977
Listen to me.

818
00:54:29.002 --> 00:54:30.889
Listen to me.

819
00:54:30.914 --> 00:54:33.966
I'll go alone, and none
of this will happen.


820
00:54:34.136 --> 00:54:35.278
Don't worry.

821
00:54:35.303 --> 00:54:37.212
Oh, so you mean let
them kill me today


822
00:54:37.236 --> 00:54:38.821
so that maybe you
can change time


823
00:54:38.846 --> 00:54:40.439
and I might be alive tomorrow?

824
00:54:40.464 --> 00:54:41.135
Yeah.

825
00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.086
Yeah, no, thanks.

826
00:54:42.111 --> 00:54:43.111
Stop!

827
00:54:46.755 --> 00:54:49.338
What is that in your hand, boy?

828
00:54:51.174 --> 00:54:52.115
A rib.

829
00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:54.337
From the owner of
that there heart.


830
00:54:54.362 --> 00:54:56.349
You've been holding
out on me, Russell.


831
00:54:56.374 --> 00:54:57.992
Oh, no.

832
00:54:58.232 --> 00:54:59.982
I forgot he had that.

833
00:55:01.034 --> 00:55:06.034
Insurance, just in case another
Old One were to possess me.


834
00:55:06.059 --> 00:55:08.327
You won't need insurance
where you're going.


835
00:55:08.352 --> 00:55:11.150
Ghasts, step back now!

836
00:55:19.635 --> 00:55:20.635
Kids!

837
00:55:22.086 --> 00:55:23.219
Right?

838
00:55:23.244 --> 00:55:24.729
- Right.
- You too understand


839
00:55:24.754 --> 00:55:25.728
what I'm doing.

840
00:55:25.753 --> 00:55:27.081
Sure.

841
00:55:29.885 --> 00:55:32.611
Give it to me now.

842
00:55:32.936 --> 00:55:33.936
Wait.

843
00:55:36.181 --> 00:55:37.459
Tillinghast?

844
00:55:40.915 --> 00:55:43.248
You may go to Tillinghast.

845
00:55:44.315 --> 00:55:45.315
Both of you.

846
00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:51.890
Thank you.

847
00:56:09.584 --> 00:56:10.584
Enter.

848
00:56:14.837 --> 00:56:15.837
Enter.

849
00:56:17.438 --> 00:56:18.301
Let's go.

850
00:56:18.326 --> 00:56:19.654
In there?

851
00:56:19.679 --> 00:56:21.392
- Yeah.
- No, I thought we were going


852
00:56:21.485 --> 00:56:22.295
to drive to Tillinghast

853
00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:23.549
in like Encino or
Barstow or something.


854
00:56:23.574 --> 00:56:24.574
Gentlemen!

855
00:56:26.807 --> 00:56:27.807
Come on!

856
00:56:32.993 --> 00:56:34.576
Oh, God!

857
00:57:04.149 --> 00:57:05.153
I can see 'em.

858
00:57:05.178 --> 00:57:06.692
We're getting close.

859
00:57:06.717 --> 00:57:07.571
That way.

860
00:57:07.596 --> 00:57:09.016
Turn.

861
00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:11.426
What, this way?

862
00:58:11.164 --> 00:58:14.645
Ah!

863
00:58:19.118 --> 00:58:20.409
What is this place?

864
00:58:20.434 --> 00:58:21.601
Our destiny.

865
00:58:45.216 --> 00:58:46.394
Tillinghast?

866
00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:52.062
What, no lights?

867
00:58:52.087 --> 00:58:53.087
No lights.

868
00:58:59.598 --> 00:59:01.286
Over there, look.

869
00:59:01.311 --> 00:59:02.628
Huh.

870
00:59:02.653 --> 00:59:04.754
That's a nice find.

871
00:59:04.779 --> 00:59:05.971
Matches?

872
00:59:05.996 --> 00:59:09.739
Uh, no, sorry.

873
00:59:09.764 --> 00:59:12.950
Um, hey, check the pockets.

874
00:59:13.044 --> 00:59:14.645
All right.

875
00:59:15.372 --> 00:59:16.880
Ha ha, bingo.

876
00:59:19.864 --> 00:59:23.444
I knew I brought you
along for a reason.


877
00:59:23.469 --> 00:59:24.279
Oh, yeah, really?

878
00:59:24.303 --> 00:59:25.954
You're ready to leave me
back there to be torn apart


879
00:59:25.978 --> 00:59:27.224
by the gads.

880
00:59:27.249 --> 00:59:28.249
Ghasts.

881
00:59:33.775 --> 00:59:37.000
So, uh, what's with the clothes?

882
00:59:37.025 --> 00:59:37.854
I don't know.

883
00:59:37.879 --> 00:59:39.817
We need to turn on the power.

884
00:59:39.842 --> 00:59:41.342
Mm-hmm.

885
00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:44.420
Cellar.

886
00:59:45.208 --> 00:59:46.017
Down there?

887
00:59:46.042 --> 00:59:47.042
Yeah.

888
01:00:16.199 --> 01:00:19.532
Oh, God, it smells
horrible down here.


889
01:00:19.943 --> 01:00:22.953
Mm. Breathe through your mouth.

890
01:00:22.978 --> 01:00:24.983
Man, your century of
wisdom is really starting


891
01:00:25.008 --> 01:00:26.636
to rub off on me.

892
01:00:26.661 --> 01:00:27.818
Oh, thank you.

893
01:00:27.843 --> 01:00:28.843
Keep going.

894
01:00:37.827 --> 01:00:40.898
Hey, uh, what's with all
the furniture down here?


895
01:00:40.923 --> 01:00:43.106
Probably didn't
want it destroyed.


896
01:00:43.131 --> 01:00:44.714
- Destroyed?
- Yup.


897
01:00:46.997 --> 01:00:48.215
All right.

898
01:00:49.477 --> 01:00:50.327
Here it is.

899
01:00:50.725 --> 01:00:52.122
No!

900
01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:54.596
Tillinghast?

901
01:00:54.995 --> 01:00:57.347
I put an end to him and
his infernal machine.


902
01:00:57.372 --> 01:00:59.918
I will stop anyone
from bringing back.


903
01:00:59.943 --> 01:01:03.323
Uh, I'm afraid we're
gonna need his resonator.


904
01:01:03.348 --> 01:01:05.314
Do you know what
swept up the servants?


905
01:01:05.338 --> 01:01:07.067
What made them scream so loud?

906
01:01:07.092 --> 01:01:09.099
Oh, that explains the clothes.

907
01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:10.785
Russell, what do we do?

908
01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:11.935
Um.

909
01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.016
It harnesses the
shadows that strikes


910
01:01:14.041 --> 01:01:16.735
from world to world to
sow death and madness.


911
01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:19.007
It must be never active again.

912
01:01:19.031 --> 01:01:23.396
He's only an apparition
of what once was.


913
01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.338
Well, apparition or
not, he's got a gun.


914
01:01:25.362 --> 01:01:26.247
What if you're wrong?

915
01:01:26.272 --> 01:01:28.136
I've killed those
that came before.


916
01:01:28.243 --> 01:01:29.243
Step aside.

917
01:01:30.004 --> 01:01:30.814
I'm not.

918
01:01:30.839 --> 01:01:31.919
Don't force me to kill you.

919
01:01:38.883 --> 01:01:40.678
He's gone?

920
01:01:40.703 --> 01:01:41.786
I told you.

921
01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:46.120
All right, look, we got to
hurry before the pets come.


922
01:01:46.145 --> 01:01:47.633
Let's go.

923
01:02:15.093 --> 01:02:17.042
Are you sure we're safe?

924
01:02:17.308 --> 01:02:18.285
Holy.

925
01:02:18.310 --> 01:02:20.059
They wouldn't dare.

926
01:02:23.124 --> 01:02:24.815
Nyarlathotep!

927
01:02:24.842 --> 01:02:26.991
No, we don't want
the light Old One!


928
01:02:27.016 --> 01:02:32.784
Strangers who seek horror
haunt strange far places.


929
01:02:32.809 --> 01:02:36.790
For them are the
catacombs of Ptolemais,


930
01:02:36.815 --> 01:02:41.661
and the carven mausolea of
the nightmare countries.


931
01:02:41.685 --> 01:02:47.015
They climb the moonlit towers
of ruined, Rhine castles


932
01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.261
and faltered down the dark,

933
01:02:49.285 --> 01:02:52.406
cobweb steps beneath
the scattered stones


934
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:55.875
of the forgotten cities in Asia,

935
01:02:55.899 --> 01:02:59.276
the haunted wood and
the desolate mountain


936
01:02:59.301 --> 01:03:02.894
are their shrines
and they linger


937
01:03:02.919 --> 01:03:09.339
next to sinister monoliths
in uninhibited islands.


938
01:03:12.431 --> 01:03:15.342
But the true epicure
of the terrible


939
01:03:15.367 --> 01:03:18.554
of unutterable ghastliness
is the chief end


940
01:03:18.579 --> 01:03:21.141
in justification of existence.

941
01:03:21.166 --> 01:03:23.773
It seems most of
all the ancient,


942
01:03:23.798 --> 01:03:26.835
lonely farmhouses
of back New England.


943
01:03:26.859 --> 01:03:31.492
For there, the dark elements
of strength, solitude,


944
01:03:31.516 --> 01:03:33.990
grotesqueness, ignorance combine

945
01:03:34.014 --> 01:03:38.237
to perform the perfection
of the hideous.


946
01:03:39.123 --> 01:03:42.316
Greetings, Nyarlathotep.

947
01:03:42.904 --> 01:03:45.355
Welcome, great Old One.

948
01:03:46.168 --> 01:03:47.725
Finley, is it?

949
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:50.417
Yes, we met centuries ago.

950
01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:51.554
Mmm.

951
01:03:51.579 --> 01:03:54.700
It was a pleasure
then as it is now,


952
01:03:54.738 --> 01:03:57.722
though you look different.

953
01:03:58.625 --> 01:04:00.201
New vessel.

954
01:04:00.226 --> 01:04:01.667
Oh, I see.

955
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:03.973
This one suits you.

956
01:04:04.971 --> 01:04:08.581
Oh, it's stronger, younger.

957
01:04:09.271 --> 01:04:13.612
We seek those that
came in that car.


958
01:04:14.457 --> 01:04:16.836
I assumed as much.

959
01:04:26.027 --> 01:04:28.307
Who the fuck are you?

960
01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:29.964
Where are we?

961
01:04:29.989 --> 01:04:32.842
There was a problem, he's
not feeling too well.


962
01:04:32.867 --> 01:04:34.144
Get the fuck off me, prick.

963
01:04:34.168 --> 01:04:35.894
Where the fuck are we?

964
01:04:35.919 --> 01:04:38.511
Ghasts!

965
01:04:39.133 --> 01:04:41.547
You wouldn't dare.

966
01:04:41.672 --> 01:04:43.221
Ghasts!

967
01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:44.689
Get in the light, Buck.

968
01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:46.159
Get in the light.

969
01:04:46.184 --> 01:04:48.228
I thought you said
they couldn't hurt us.


970
01:04:48.253 --> 01:04:50.249
I said they wouldn't hurt it.

971
01:04:50.274 --> 01:04:51.084
Old One.

972
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:55.974
Normally, yes, but you
don't seem true, Mr. Finley.


973
01:04:55.999 --> 01:04:57.416
Too foul-mouthed.

974
01:04:59.222 --> 01:05:01.386
I'm not Finley.

975
01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:04.308
I'm Randolph Carter.

976
01:05:04.512 --> 01:05:09.150
I'm an Old One and
if you dare touch me,


977
01:05:09.175 --> 01:05:13.329
I will lay waste to your human.

978
01:05:26.046 --> 01:05:27.046
Oh my.

979
01:05:28.075 --> 01:05:29.292
Oh, shit.

980
01:05:39.278 --> 01:05:41.708
I'm Randolph Carter.

981
01:05:41.778 --> 01:05:45.831
Security guard at Irons
Construction Yard.


982
01:05:46.874 --> 01:05:50.504
I have felt the
strangling tendrils


983
01:05:50.529 --> 01:05:54.568
of cancerous horror
whose roots reach


984
01:05:54.593 --> 01:05:58.582
into illimitable past and
fathomless abyss of night


985
01:05:58.607 --> 01:06:01.151
that proved beyond on time.

986
01:06:02.206 --> 01:06:03.688
And I thank you.

987
01:06:05.477 --> 01:06:10.941
I thank you for removing
this foul, foul beast.


988
01:06:13.984 --> 01:06:16.246
I am free.

989
01:06:16.271 --> 01:06:17.613
I'm free.

990
01:06:17.638 --> 01:06:23.266
Thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you.


991
01:06:23.291 --> 01:06:27.374
Thank you, thank you.

992
01:06:27.897 --> 01:06:29.397
Drink, children.

993
01:06:35.419 --> 01:06:37.900
Thank you, thank you, thank you,

994
01:06:37.925 --> 01:06:39.592
thank you very much.

995
01:06:40.464 --> 01:06:43.962
You return to your
home by the sea.


996
01:06:44.212 --> 01:06:49.706
Think of me when you hear the
wing beats of the nightgaunts.


997
01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:54.110
He killed him.

998
01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:55.624
He killed Finley.

999
01:06:55.649 --> 01:06:59.062
He killed a great Old
One right in front of me.


1000
01:06:59.087 --> 01:07:01.550
You seen it in the
Legrasse, you seen it?


1001
01:07:01.575 --> 01:07:04.282
Can't see nothing, Buck.

1002
01:07:04.307 --> 01:07:07.048
I'll be killed soon enough,
it'll get me to the doctor.


1003
01:07:07.073 --> 01:07:09.847
Get you to Doc
Rayburn, you hear me?


1004
01:07:09.872 --> 01:07:11.206
I hear you.

1005
01:07:13.594 --> 01:07:18.769
Hey, hey, hey, you
ever seen a nightgaunt?


1006
01:07:19.170 --> 01:07:21.078
No, can't see as I did.

1007
01:07:21.204 --> 01:07:25.297
Well, if you see or hear
the wing beats of one,


1008
01:07:25.321 --> 01:07:29.333
you best let me know
and I'll let you know.


1009
01:07:29.357 --> 01:07:31.264
Because that be the
reminder of the night


1010
01:07:31.288 --> 01:07:36.288
our lives were spared
by Nyarlathotep.


1011
01:07:36.313 --> 01:07:38.609
I will.

1012
01:07:38.634 --> 01:07:39.843
Hold on!

1013
01:07:44.056 --> 01:07:47.509
Hey, so what are these
pets you mentioned?


1014
01:07:47.534 --> 01:07:50.933
Tillinghast's pets
aren't pretty.


1015
01:07:51.406 --> 01:07:54.152
Cats, dogs, rabbits, what?

1016
01:07:54.177 --> 01:07:57.583
Don't worry, you
won't see them yet.


1017
01:07:57.630 --> 01:08:01.191
Hey, wait a second,
do you hear that hum?


1018
01:08:01.216 --> 01:08:02.026
What is that?

1019
01:08:02.051 --> 01:08:05.217
That's the resonator,
it's up there.


1020
01:08:07.172 --> 01:08:10.365
Hey, listen, but if
he killed Tillinghast


1021
01:08:10.389 --> 01:08:13.222
Crawford Tillinghast isn't dead.

1022
01:08:42.119 --> 01:08:45.011
Welcome, my friends.

1023
01:08:46.526 --> 01:08:50.214
I see Captain Norrys
did not deter you.


1024
01:08:52.506 --> 01:08:56.097
Back to the rats, he goes.

1025
01:08:59.281 --> 01:09:03.644
Excuse my inability to stand
and greet you properly.


1026
01:09:04.571 --> 01:09:06.346
That's all right.

1027
01:09:06.471 --> 01:09:09.612
I am Crawford Tillinghast.

1028
01:09:10.450 --> 01:09:12.487
I am Russell Marsh.

1029
01:09:14.498 --> 01:09:15.831
Gideon Gordon.

1030
01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:21.293
Does my appearance
startle you, Mr. Gordon?


1031
01:09:21.318 --> 01:09:23.214
You seem uncomfortable.

1032
01:09:23.239 --> 01:09:26.288
No, I just have a wandering eye.

1033
01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:29.369
Had it ever since I was a kid,
makes it hard sometimes to.


1034
01:09:33.939 --> 01:09:36.142
That's a sweet,

1035
01:09:36.167 --> 01:09:37.503
adorable lie.

1036
01:09:39.249 --> 01:09:42.643
These sights are new
to him, Crawford.


1037
01:09:42.784 --> 01:09:44.441
I understand.

1038
01:09:45.786 --> 01:09:50.456
Then I assume you have
come to see my experiment.


1039
01:09:52.456 --> 01:09:55.566
Behold, the resonator.

1040
01:09:58.286 --> 01:09:59.619
Yes.

1041
01:10:00.487 --> 01:10:03.634
Um, I need the help
of your machine


1042
01:10:03.907 --> 01:10:05.490
to go back in time.

1043
01:10:06.578 --> 01:10:07.578
Exciting.

1044
01:10:11.062 --> 01:10:17.441
An epic challenge to test
the limits of my genius,


1045
01:10:17.745 --> 01:10:20.198
of my resonator.

1046
01:10:20.579 --> 01:10:21.996
Is it possible?

1047
01:10:23.626 --> 01:10:24.626
Possible?

1048
01:10:25.981 --> 01:10:28.112
Anything is possible.

1049
01:10:29.421 --> 01:10:35.941
Except we will need more
energy for such a feat.


1050
01:10:36.063 --> 01:10:39.813
Well, where do we
get more power?


1051
01:10:41.328 --> 01:10:42.455
From me.

1052
01:10:43.593 --> 01:10:45.930
I am the body electric.

1053
01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:52.539
But to send you back,
we'll need more.


1054
01:10:53.866 --> 01:10:55.961
Much more.

1055
01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:58.758
You feel that?

1056
01:11:00.301 --> 01:11:02.461
Since stepping into this room,

1057
01:11:02.486 --> 01:11:05.902
you have already
given it more volts


1058
01:11:05.927 --> 01:11:10.927
than the feeble conduits within
the walls could ever muster.


1059
01:11:12.844 --> 01:11:17.375
But your friend,
connected to me,


1060
01:11:18.415 --> 01:11:21.783
will give it all
energy required.


1061
01:11:21.808 --> 01:11:24.805
For your journey, Mr. Marsh.

1062
01:11:26.297 --> 01:11:29.375
Come to me, Gideon Gordon.

1063
01:11:31.824 --> 01:11:32.801
Go ahead, kid.

1064
01:11:32.825 --> 01:11:34.874
Hey, no, no, no, you're not
hooking that thing up to me.


1065
01:11:34.898 --> 01:11:37.580
Hey, come on, go on, go on, kid.

1066
01:11:37.604 --> 01:11:38.961
It's okay to be scared.

1067
01:11:38.986 --> 01:11:40.355
I'm scared too.

1068
01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:43.644
But we have to do things
sometimes that, you know.


1069
01:11:43.668 --> 01:11:45.852
No, no, no, no fucking way!

1070
01:11:45.877 --> 01:11:46.687
Kid!

1071
01:11:46.712 --> 01:11:50.241
Dear Mr. Gordon,
don't leave this room.


1072
01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.670
My pets are swimming about.

1073
01:11:53.832 --> 01:11:57.665
So long as you don't
move, you're fairly safe.


1074
01:11:58.801 --> 01:12:03.563
Remember, we are dealing
with a hideous world


1075
01:12:04.090 --> 01:12:08.547
in which we are
practically helpless.


1076
01:12:09.799 --> 01:12:17.664
Keep still, for in these
rays, we are able to be seen


1077
01:12:18.006 --> 01:12:20.224
as well as to see.

1078
01:12:22.316 --> 01:12:24.165
Listen to him, kid.

1079
01:12:24.190 --> 01:12:26.940
Beyond the bounds of infinity,

1080
01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:32.685
and drawing down
demons from the stars,


1081
01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:37.052
space belongs to me.

1082
01:12:38.026 --> 01:12:39.310
Do you hear?

1083
01:12:42.188 --> 01:12:43.538
- I can't.
- Gideon, no!


1084
01:12:43.563 --> 01:12:45.396
- I'm sorry.
- Gideon!


1085
01:13:33.223 --> 01:13:34.697
Son.

1086
01:13:34.722 --> 01:13:35.722
Dad?

1087
01:13:36.573 --> 01:13:40.202
I found you through
this chasm of darkness.


1088
01:13:40.414 --> 01:13:43.459
Dad, you're really here.

1089
01:13:43.484 --> 01:13:46.420
I, I miss you so much.

1090
01:13:47.315 --> 01:13:49.148
I miss you too, son.

1091
01:13:51.810 --> 01:13:53.498
I'm so scared.

1092
01:13:53.663 --> 01:13:55.083
Don't be afraid.

1093
01:13:55.108 --> 01:13:57.252
I'll always be by your side.

1094
01:13:57.282 --> 01:13:58.854
I'm proud of you.

1095
01:13:58.879 --> 01:14:02.625
Proud of all the great things
you have and will accomplish.


1096
01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:05.177
Dad, I can bring you back.

1097
01:14:06.168 --> 01:14:06.978
They're coming.

1098
01:14:07.018 --> 01:14:08.241
I have to go.

1099
01:14:08.266 --> 01:14:09.201
What is it?

1100
01:14:09.226 --> 01:14:12.507
Things, horrific
things, hunting me.


1101
01:14:12.801 --> 01:14:15.813
Things that dissolve and devour.

1102
01:14:15.838 --> 01:14:16.913
I have to go.

1103
01:14:16.938 --> 01:14:18.163
Keep my memory alive.

1104
01:14:18.188 --> 01:14:19.394
Keep my memory alive!

1105
01:14:19.419 --> 01:14:20.927
Dad!

1106
01:14:21.271 --> 01:14:22.873
Close the door?

1107
01:14:25.175 --> 01:14:27.236
Keep it away!

1108
01:14:27.261 --> 01:14:29.094
Oh, you're safe now.

1109
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:31.748
I saw him.

1110
01:14:32.341 --> 01:14:33.914
I saw my dad.

1111
01:14:35.022 --> 01:14:37.355
He was there, but he wasn't.

1112
01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.420
I've never seen him so scared.

1113
01:14:42.277 --> 01:14:43.087
It's all right.

1114
01:14:43.112 --> 01:14:45.470
I couldn't help him.

1115
01:14:45.495 --> 01:14:47.170
It's all right now.

1116
01:14:47.302 --> 01:14:49.305
You can help him.

1117
01:14:49.330 --> 01:14:51.052
You can help him, come on.

1118
01:14:51.077 --> 01:14:52.116
Get up.

1119
01:14:52.141 --> 01:14:53.141
Come on.

1120
01:14:57.079 --> 01:14:59.435
I've, never seen him so scared.

1121
01:14:59.917 --> 01:15:02.198
All right, okay, all right.

1122
01:15:16.381 --> 01:15:20.381
By God, I'll do it.

1123
01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:26.193
God has nothing to do with it.

1124
01:15:27.673 --> 01:15:33.543
Sights which no
breathing creature


1125
01:15:33.568 --> 01:15:34.777
has yet seen.

1126
01:15:36.511 --> 01:15:42.091
You shall over leap time, space,

1127
01:15:43.031 --> 01:15:48.818
and dimensions, and
without bodily motion,


1128
01:15:49.231 --> 01:15:53.310
peer to the bottom of creation.

1129
01:15:53.663 --> 01:15:55.163
Sit him before me.

1130
01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:57.240
Sit. Sit.

1131
01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:06.896
Russell, kneel down behind him.

1132
01:16:07.511 --> 01:16:08.607
Touch him.

1133
01:16:08.632 --> 01:16:09.762
- Yeah.
- Touch.


1134
01:16:09.787 --> 01:16:10.597
Hurry.

1135
01:16:10.622 --> 01:16:12.621
Before I change my mind.

1136
01:16:15.411 --> 01:16:22.810
Russell, I must warn
you, the waves from us


1137
01:16:22.981 --> 01:16:27.318
will be waking 1000
sleeping senses in you,


1138
01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:33.162
senses which we inherit
from aeons of evolution,


1139
01:16:34.384 --> 01:16:38.552
from the state of
detached electrons,


1140
01:16:39.365 --> 01:16:43.373
to the state of
organic humanity.


1141
01:16:44.806 --> 01:16:51.060
I have seen truth, and I
intend to show it to you.


1142
01:16:52.408 --> 01:16:57.826
But remember, if you
manage to reach your time,


1143
01:16:58.325 --> 01:17:05.552
your space, that someone
else will fill the void


1144
01:17:05.577 --> 01:17:08.021
in the change you create.

1145
01:17:10.312 --> 01:17:11.562
I understand.

1146
01:17:12.190 --> 01:17:13.357
Both of you.

1147
01:17:15.272 --> 01:17:20.499
I must, I must return
to make things right,


1148
01:17:20.524 --> 01:17:24.060
to make things right
for you and me, kid.


1149
01:17:24.085 --> 01:17:25.085
Yes.

1150
01:17:26.446 --> 01:17:27.446
Very well.

1151
01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:31.647
Think of your time.

1152
01:17:33.665 --> 01:17:34.665
Faces.

1153
01:17:36.349 --> 01:17:37.349
Smells.

1154
01:17:38.325 --> 01:17:39.325
Joys.

1155
01:17:40.888 --> 01:17:41.888
Sorrows.

1156
01:17:43.654 --> 01:17:44.934
Remember.

1157
01:17:44.966 --> 01:17:51.748
Back, back to September 7th.

1158
01:17:52.559 --> 01:17:53.699
No, no, no.

1159
01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:58.599
September 6th, 1930.

1160
01:17:58.624 --> 01:18:01.591
September 6th, 1930.

1161
01:18:01.775 --> 01:18:05.060
Emily, come to me.

1162
01:18:08.821 --> 01:18:10.224
Concentrate.

1163
01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:16.748
My pets.

1164
01:18:18.095 --> 01:18:21.826
You see them, you see them.

1165
01:18:23.146 --> 01:18:25.443
See the things that float

1166
01:18:25.468 --> 01:18:28.921
and flop about you and
through you every moment


1167
01:18:28.946 --> 01:18:30.646
of your life.

1168
01:18:33.779 --> 01:18:39.357
You see, the creatures
that form what men


1169
01:18:39.382 --> 01:18:44.763
call the pure air
and the blue skies.


1170
01:18:49.559 --> 01:18:53.476
We have succeeded in
breaking down the barrier.


1171
01:18:54.842 --> 01:18:58.817
Have I not shown you
your world, Russell?


1172
01:18:58.887 --> 01:18:59.697
Russell?

1173
01:18:59.722 --> 01:19:03.959
I have seen the dark
universe yawning.


1174
01:19:05.547 --> 01:19:10.825
The black planets
rolling without aim.


1175
01:19:11.204 --> 01:19:14.059
Rolling in their horror,

1176
01:19:14.084 --> 01:19:18.372
unheated without,
without knowledge.


1177
01:19:18.397 --> 01:19:21.051
Luster, name.

1178
01:19:22.450 --> 01:19:24.637
Oh, I see it.

1179
01:19:25.616 --> 01:19:26.802
I see her.

1180
01:19:27.848 --> 01:19:29.167
I see her.

1181
01:19:30.411 --> 01:19:32.026
Emily!

1182
01:19:32.731 --> 01:19:33.913
Emily!

1183
01:19:46.334 --> 01:19:48.215
Emily.

1184
01:19:50.075 --> 01:19:51.475
Russell.

1185
01:19:52.399 --> 01:19:54.262
What's wrong, dear?

1186
01:19:54.287 --> 01:19:55.576
Bad dream.

1187
01:19:56.609 --> 01:19:57.973
You're safe.

1188
01:19:57.998 --> 01:19:59.453
I know.

1189
01:19:59.478 --> 01:20:00.478
I know.

1190
01:20:01.777 --> 01:20:04.684
You best get back to sleep.

1191
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:07.301
You got to go out
early tomorrow.


1192
01:20:07.326 --> 01:20:08.847
What?

1193
01:20:09.146 --> 01:20:10.979
On your boat, silly.

1194
01:20:11.965 --> 01:20:13.473
I'm not going out on that boat

1195
01:20:13.498 --> 01:20:15.919
or any other boat ever again.

1196
01:20:18.735 --> 01:20:20.419
Ever.

1197
01:20:28.422 --> 01:20:29.706
Hey, Dad.

1198
01:20:29.731 --> 01:20:31.814
Dad, I got something big.

1199
01:20:34.059 --> 01:20:35.895
Help me, Dad, hurry.

1200
01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.951
Dad, give me a hand, come on.

1201
01:20:39.315 --> 01:20:40.981
What is it?

1202
01:20:50.964 --> 01:20:52.464
It's just a log.

1203
01:20:55.506 --> 01:20:57.262
What's this?

1204
01:20:57.287 --> 01:20:59.954
I just missed you is all, Dad.

1205
01:21:00.921 --> 01:21:01.921
I love you.

1206
01:21:03.535 --> 01:21:04.952
I love you too.

1207
01:21:06.107 --> 01:21:09.122
Come on, I got something
I want to show you.


1208
01:21:09.413 --> 01:21:10.837
Okay.

1209
01:21:19.151 --> 01:21:20.453
Dad, what is it?

1210
01:21:20.478 --> 01:21:23.213
Something I've been waiting
a lifetime for you to see.


1211
01:21:23.238 --> 01:21:25.050
Dad, come on, enough with
the mysterious routine.


1212
01:21:25.075 --> 01:21:26.715
I get it, what is it?

1213
01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:31.498
See the light, son.

1214
01:21:31.522 --> 01:21:33.458
No, no, no, no!

1215
01:21:35.238 --> 01:21:38.785
I must warn you, if you manage

1216
01:21:38.809 --> 01:21:44.794
to reach your time, your
space, that someone else


1217
01:21:45.041 --> 01:21:49.419
will fill the void in
the change you create.
