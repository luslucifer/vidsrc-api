3
00:00:09.132 --> 00:00:11.651
President's car is now
turning onto Elm Street,


4
00:00:11.735 --> 00:00:13.187
and it will be
only a matter of minutes

5
00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:15.222
before he arrives at the Trade Mart.

6
00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:23.763
It--it a--it appears as though

7
00:00:23.847 --> 00:00:26.065
something has happened
in the motorcade route.


8
00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:27.534
Something, I repeat, has happened

9
00:00:27.618 --> 00:00:28.968
in the motorcade route.

10
00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:32.472
This is Walter Cronkite in our newsroom,

11
00:00:32.556 --> 00:00:35.242
and there has been an attempt,

12
00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:38.011
as perhaps you know now, on
the life of President Kennedy.


13
00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:41.181
It was the first time

14
00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:44.618
that the public had seen
a murder on television.


15
00:00:44.702 --> 00:00:46.786
We heard Kennedy had been shot

16
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.722
and he was being brought
to the emergency room


17
00:00:48.806 --> 00:00:51.225
at Parkland Hospital.

18
00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.793
Within minutes
of seeing President Kennedy,


19
00:00:53.877 --> 00:00:55.329
doctors at Parkland concluded

20
00:00:55.413 --> 00:00:57.764
that the neck wound was an entrance wound

21
00:00:57.848 --> 00:01:00.734
and the head wound was an exit wound.

22
00:01:00.818 --> 00:01:05.004
My president had been
assassinated and was dead.


23
00:01:05.088 --> 00:01:07.941
My goodness, you've just
taken care of the president,


24
00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:08.908
and he's dead.

25
00:01:08.992 --> 00:01:10.444
Did that really happen,

26
00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:11.911
or was this a nightmare?

27
00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:13.179
My God.

28
00:01:13.263 --> 00:01:15.282
Parkland Hospital doctors were quoted

29
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.551
as saying they thought
at least one bullet entered


30
00:01:17.635 --> 00:01:19.586
Mr. Kennedy's neck from the front.

31
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.755
The Parkland doctors were

32
00:01:21.839 --> 00:01:23.790
a serious problem for the U.S. government

33
00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:26.960
because they had provided evidence

34
00:01:27.044 --> 00:01:28.995
that there was a shooter
somewhere in the front,


35
00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.898
and that ran totally contrary
to the official narrative


36
00:01:31.982 --> 00:01:35.168
of a lone shooter from above and behind.

37
00:01:35.252 --> 00:01:36.503
All this mattered,

38
00:01:36.587 --> 00:01:40.039
because Oswald had
to have had an accomplice.


39
00:01:40.123 --> 00:01:41.708
The government narrative is

40
00:01:41.792 --> 00:01:44.127
that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone...

41
00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:49.048
Killing President Kennedy, case closed.

42
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:53.620
And as we know,
it was not case closed

43
00:01:53.704 --> 00:01:56.456
at that particular point.

44
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.659
Who was behind all of this?

45
00:01:59.743 --> 00:02:01.961
Certain people in our government tampered

46
00:02:02.045 --> 00:02:04.798
with critical evidence
in order to make sure


47
00:02:04.882 --> 00:02:06.132
the American people would not
know the truth


48
00:02:06.216 --> 00:02:08.768
about who murdered the president.

49
00:02:08.852 --> 00:02:11.905
Documents are withheld
by the FBI, the CIA.


50
00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.641
Intelligence agencies did
all the wrong things


51
00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:17.477
if they were looking for conspiracy.

52
00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:19.913
A lot of people just decided
to keep their mouths shut,


53
00:02:19.997 --> 00:02:22.316
including the Parkland doctors.

54
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.017
I didn't want to be a target

55
00:02:24.101 --> 00:02:27.220
for those who had killed our president.

56
00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:34.861
So I didn't tell
anybody for over 30 years

57
00:02:34.945 --> 00:02:37.964
that I was present in Trauma Room 1.

58
00:02:38.048 --> 00:02:40.500
Because so many people did die

59
00:02:40.584 --> 00:02:43.637
who had been involved
in the assassination.


60
00:02:43.721 --> 00:02:46.773
And he said, you
must never, ever say that

61
00:02:46.857 --> 00:02:49.108
that was an entrance wound again

62
00:02:49.192 --> 00:02:50.677
if you know what's good for you.

63
00:02:52.863 --> 00:02:56.816
What actually happened in
Trauma Room 1 never came out,


64
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.251
never became public.

65
00:02:58.335 --> 00:03:00.387
I was there.

66
00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:01.855
I know what I saw.

67
00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.123
I was there.
I remember it in detail.


68
00:03:04.207 --> 00:03:07.327
It's etched in my memory forever.

69
00:03:07.411 --> 00:03:08.628
What's more likely,

70
00:03:08.712 --> 00:03:10.229
Parkland doctors telling the truth

71
00:03:10.313 --> 00:03:12.683
or the autopsy telling the truth?

72
00:03:13.917 --> 00:03:16.503
The Parkland doctors told the truth.

73
00:03:16.587 --> 00:03:19.539
These doctors are about
as trustworthy as you can get.


74
00:03:19.623 --> 00:03:22.141
This country has not been told the truth

75
00:03:22.225 --> 00:03:23.961
about the JFK assassination.

76
00:03:25.463 --> 00:03:28.382
Will people feel that they have

77
00:03:28.466 --> 00:03:32.552
a better understanding
of what actually happened?


78
00:03:34.938 --> 00:03:36.423
Absolutely.

79
00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:10.089
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

80
00:04:10.173 --> 00:04:13.359
This is Bob Walker speaking
from Dallas Love Field,


81
00:04:13.443 --> 00:04:16.696
where a large crowd is
gathered now to await


82
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.298
the arrival of President and
Mrs. John Fitzgerald Kennedy


83
00:04:19.382 --> 00:04:22.602
from Carswell Air Force Base
in Fort Worth.


84
00:04:24.588 --> 00:04:26.139
We were aware

85
00:04:26.223 --> 00:04:28.675
that the president was coming to Dallas.

86
00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.427
It had been well publicized.

87
00:04:33.263 --> 00:04:36.550
Police were circling
the field all morning long


88
00:04:36.634 --> 00:04:38.017
from the early morning hours,

89
00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:40.904
and a huge contingent
of police are on hand.


90
00:04:42.873 --> 00:04:46.460
Next big jet approaching,
and this one should contain


91
00:04:46.544 --> 00:04:48.928
the president and Mrs. Kennedy.

92
00:04:49.012 --> 00:04:51.565
Here comes Jack!

93
00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:53.517
He was like a rock star.

94
00:04:56.286 --> 00:04:58.872
He was handsome and rich.

95
00:04:58.956 --> 00:05:00.540
He had a pretty wife.

96
00:05:00.624 --> 00:05:01.708
I liked him.

97
00:05:01.792 --> 00:05:04.478
I thought he was really cool.

98
00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:07.447
Right into us now.

99
00:05:12.903 --> 00:05:16.355
And the crowd below is cheering.

100
00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:17.757
There's Mrs. Kennedy

101
00:05:17.841 --> 00:05:20.126
and the President of the United States.

102
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.162
And I can see his suntan
all the way from here.


103
00:05:23.246 --> 00:05:26.165
Crowd waving, as you can see.

104
00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:28.334
People standing up
all over everything available


105
00:05:28.418 --> 00:05:31.605
to get a glimpse
of the president and his wife.


106
00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:33.607
Oh, I idolized him.

107
00:05:33.691 --> 00:05:35.893
I was a Democrat, of course.

108
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:41.848
And he's broken away from his plan

109
00:05:41.932 --> 00:05:45.919
and gone right up to the fence
to shake hands with people.


110
00:05:46.003 --> 00:05:47.220
Boy, this is something.

111
00:05:47.304 --> 00:05:49.188
It makes the eggshells even thinner

112
00:05:49.272 --> 00:05:51.057
for the Secret Service, whose job it is

113
00:05:51.141 --> 00:05:53.092
to guard the man.

114
00:05:53.176 --> 00:05:55.228
I was very excited that the president

115
00:05:55.312 --> 00:05:58.148
and Jacqueline Kennedy were
coming to Dallas.


116
00:06:00.718 --> 00:06:05.171
And I was sorry that I was
on call at Parkland


117
00:06:05.255 --> 00:06:07.907
because I wanted to go down
and see the parade.


118
00:06:07.991 --> 00:06:10.744
And back they go to the car.

119
00:06:10.828 --> 00:06:14.431
The Governor Connally standing
in the car beaming.


120
00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:19.185
Now the motorcade will
very shortly start to move out


121
00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:22.388
for downtown Dallas,
where thousands should already


122
00:06:22.472 --> 00:06:25.792
be on the street right now
waiting for a view


123
00:06:25.876 --> 00:06:27.577
of the president and his wife.

124
00:06:30.147 --> 00:06:33.232
The route of the location of the parade

125
00:06:33.316 --> 00:06:36.636
had been published in the paper
two or three days before.


126
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.805
So everyone knew the route.

127
00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:42.141
And that's the reason that
there were so many thousands


128
00:06:42.225 --> 00:06:44.161
of people standing on the streets.

129
00:06:45.696 --> 00:06:48.181
There was some discussion as to whether

130
00:06:48.265 --> 00:06:51.902
it was really good for him
to come to Dallas.


131
00:06:53.971 --> 00:06:56.422
And here is the President
of the United States.


132
00:06:56.506 --> 00:06:57.891
And what a crowd.

133
00:06:57.975 --> 00:06:59.793
What a tremendous welcome
he's getting now.


134
00:06:59.877 --> 00:07:01.494
We can--and there's Jackie.

135
00:07:01.578 --> 00:07:03.196
She's getting just as big a welcome.

136
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.698
There is Lyndon Johnson

137
00:07:04.782 --> 00:07:06.499
and Lady Bird passing by
in the second car.


138
00:07:06.583 --> 00:07:09.202
And the crowd is absolutely going wild.

139
00:07:09.286 --> 00:07:11.938
This is a friendly crowd
in downtown Dallas.


140
00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:18.211
So my wife and children,
with everybody else, went out,


141
00:07:18.295 --> 00:07:20.546
and when the little motorcade coming by,

142
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.282
they saw this crowd of people,
and they slowed down,


143
00:07:23.366 --> 00:07:26.136
and Kennedy waved at them.

144
00:07:27.537 --> 00:07:29.723
President's car is now
turning onto Elm Street,


145
00:07:29.807 --> 00:07:31.357
and it will be
only a matter of minutes

146
00:07:31.441 --> 00:07:33.459
before he arrives at the Trade Mart.

147
00:07:33.543 --> 00:07:35.228
I was on Stemmons Freeway earlier,

148
00:07:35.312 --> 00:07:37.530
and even the freeway was
jam-packed with spectators.


149
00:07:37.614 --> 00:07:40.233
Yes, we were all aware
that he was coming to Dallas.


150
00:07:40.317 --> 00:07:42.836
I think the whole city was
excited about it


151
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.287
one way or another.

152
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.275
Certainly, a lot of the people
were very excited


153
00:07:49.359 --> 00:07:52.378
and made great preparation
for him to come.


154
00:07:52.462 --> 00:07:54.580
And thousands and thousands
of people who were


155
00:07:54.664 --> 00:07:57.550
crowding the streets here
are following the motorcade


156
00:07:57.634 --> 00:08:01.788
even further down Main Street
towards Stemmons Freeway.


157
00:08:01.872 --> 00:08:03.923
A wonderful welcome having been given

158
00:08:04.007 --> 00:08:06.476
to the president here in downtown Dallas.

159
00:08:14.818 --> 00:08:15.935
It--it a--

160
00:09:07.905 --> 00:09:10.189
The first time that I suspected

161
00:09:10.273 --> 00:09:12.992
that some major event had occurred

162
00:09:13.076 --> 00:09:15.394
was when the operator was paging

163
00:09:15.478 --> 00:09:18.364
through the loudspeaker system,
"The president's been shot,


164
00:09:18.448 --> 00:09:21.200
and they're bringing him
to the emergency room."


165
00:09:21.284 --> 00:09:23.636
They've called from the emergency room,

166
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.072
said that they're bringing
President Kennedy in.


167
00:09:26.156 --> 00:09:27.373
He'd been shot.

168
00:09:27.457 --> 00:09:30.176
There was a bunch
of other top-notch people


169
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.594
that were being paged.

170
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.336
The nurse ran in and said,
"The president has been shot."


171
00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.705
I ran downstairs as fast as I could

172
00:09:59.789 --> 00:10:03.309
and went into
Trauma Room number 1.


173
00:10:03.393 --> 00:10:05.511
We heard
Kennedy had been shot


174
00:10:05.595 --> 00:10:07.413
and he was being brought
to the emergency room


175
00:10:07.497 --> 00:10:09.548
at Parkland Hospital.

176
00:10:09.632 --> 00:10:12.919
When I heard that, ran down
three flights of stairs


177
00:10:13.003 --> 00:10:14.720
into the main corridor.

178
00:10:14.804 --> 00:10:18.057
And that's when you get
this tremendous rush


179
00:10:18.141 --> 00:10:20.559
of adrenaline in your body.

180
00:10:20.643 --> 00:10:23.830
And I thought, oh,
it's gonna be like John Wayne.


181
00:10:23.914 --> 00:10:25.564
He'll be sitting on the gurney,

182
00:10:25.648 --> 00:10:28.768
and he'll be like, you know,
oh, it's only a flesh wound.


183
00:10:28.852 --> 00:10:30.520
You know, I had no idea.

184
00:10:32.255 --> 00:10:35.208
The first reports say that
President Kennedy has been


185
00:10:35.292 --> 00:10:38.511
seriously wounded by this shooting.

186
00:10:38.595 --> 00:10:39.879
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

187
00:10:39.963 --> 00:10:41.414
You'll excuse the fact
that I'm out of breath,


188
00:10:41.498 --> 00:10:44.250
but about 10 or 15 minutes ago,

189
00:10:44.334 --> 00:10:46.986
a tragic thing, from all
indications at this point,


190
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.054
has happened in the city of Dallas.

191
00:10:48.138 --> 00:10:49.488
Let me quote to you this.

192
00:10:49.572 --> 00:10:51.690
"President Kennedy
and Governor John Connally have


193
00:10:51.774 --> 00:10:54.393
"been cut down by assassins'
bullets in Downtown Dallas.


194
00:10:54.477 --> 00:10:56.562
"They were riding in an open automobile

195
00:10:56.646 --> 00:10:58.231
"when the shots were fired.

196
00:10:58.315 --> 00:10:59.799
"The president, his limp body carried

197
00:10:59.883 --> 00:11:01.534
"in the arms of his wife,
Jacqueline,


198
00:11:01.618 --> 00:11:03.820
has rushed to Parkland Hospital."

199
00:11:04.955 --> 00:11:07.440
I would have expected them
to bring him to Parkland.


200
00:11:07.524 --> 00:11:10.243
First of all, it was probably
the closest hospital,


201
00:11:10.327 --> 00:11:12.178
but it was the number one trauma hospital

202
00:11:12.262 --> 00:11:13.612
in that part of the country.

203
00:11:13.696 --> 00:11:16.749
Parkland is the designated trauma center

204
00:11:16.833 --> 00:11:20.686
for all of the greater
Dallas-Fort Worth area.


205
00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.990
I had taken care of,
already, hundreds of patients


206
00:11:24.074 --> 00:11:28.394
with gunshot wounds and
injuries and car accidents.


207
00:11:28.478 --> 00:11:32.231
We were seeing two to three
gunshot wounds a day,


208
00:11:32.315 --> 00:11:34.000
plus stab wounds,

209
00:11:34.084 --> 00:11:37.003
plus blunt trauma,
such as automobile accidents.


210
00:11:37.087 --> 00:11:39.472
And we were seeing
about 5,000 a year of those.


211
00:11:39.556 --> 00:11:41.374
That's where I would have wanted to be

212
00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:42.475
if that had happened to me.

213
00:11:42.559 --> 00:11:43.709
There's no doubt about that.

214
00:11:43.793 --> 00:11:45.945
Parkland's well-known for their care

215
00:11:46.029 --> 00:11:49.399
in those kind of emergencies,
and that's what they do best.


216
00:12:07.017 --> 00:12:10.636
Within a half a minute,
door came flying open,


217
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.605
and here came the gurney with Jackie

218
00:12:12.689 --> 00:12:14.607
and the two
Secret Service guys,


219
00:12:14.691 --> 00:12:19.478
and had a terribly wounded man
on their hands.


220
00:12:19.562 --> 00:12:22.882
The president was being
wheeled on the gurney


221
00:12:22.966 --> 00:12:24.817
towards Trauma Room 1.

222
00:12:24.901 --> 00:12:27.020
I remember the Secret Service men

223
00:12:27.104 --> 00:12:30.389
and the look on their face,

224
00:12:30.473 --> 00:12:32.791
if you can imagine how relieved they were

225
00:12:32.875 --> 00:12:37.296
to pass off the mortally wounded president

226
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.366
to the doctors to take care of him.

227
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.936
And you just feel
a flush coming over your body,


228
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:47.473
and you think, my goodness,
I'm about to take care


229
00:12:47.557 --> 00:12:49.308
of the President of the United States.

230
00:12:54.497 --> 00:12:56.950
When I first walked into Trauma Room 1

231
00:12:57.034 --> 00:12:58.284
and saw the president,

232
00:12:58.368 --> 00:13:01.154
the president was on a cart.

233
00:13:01.238 --> 00:13:05.424
He had his arms out there
ready to be resuscitated.


234
00:13:05.508 --> 00:13:08.661
I was looking at him, thinking,

235
00:13:08.745 --> 00:13:11.130
he's not going to make it probably.

236
00:13:11.214 --> 00:13:14.233
But you really need to get
an airway and an IV going,


237
00:13:14.317 --> 00:13:16.169
then do your examination.

238
00:13:16.253 --> 00:13:17.937
And that's what we did.

239
00:13:18.021 --> 00:13:20.706
Dr. Carrico was the second-year resident

240
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.608
in charge of the emergency room,

241
00:13:22.692 --> 00:13:24.843
and he was attempting
to intubate the president,


242
00:13:24.927 --> 00:13:27.046
putting a tube into the windpipe.

243
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.848
There had been an attempt
by a couple of junior residents


244
00:13:29.932 --> 00:13:31.951
to get an IV
going, but because he was

245
00:13:32.035 --> 00:13:34.520
in such profound shock,
the veins were collapsed.


246
00:13:34.604 --> 00:13:36.455
But I made a
little nick in the vein

247
00:13:36.539 --> 00:13:39.458
and bare-handedly threaded
the catheter in.


248
00:13:39.542 --> 00:13:44.530
And they said, Goldstrich,
go get the defibrillator.


249
00:13:44.614 --> 00:13:47.333
So I ran out of
the room and got it out

250
00:13:47.417 --> 00:13:49.902
and pushed it as hard
as I could on the wheels


251
00:13:49.986 --> 00:13:51.070
and got it back there.

252
00:13:51.154 --> 00:13:52.371
And I'm thinking, you know,

253
00:13:52.455 --> 00:13:53.839
maybe this is gonna save his life.

254
00:13:55.992 --> 00:13:58.244
I was just a fourth-year medical student.

255
00:13:58.328 --> 00:14:00.297
I was never the guy in charge.

256
00:14:01.831 --> 00:14:04.717
We took over as more senior personnel,

257
00:14:04.801 --> 00:14:08.687
and Dr. Malcolm Perry was
really the staff person


258
00:14:08.771 --> 00:14:11.757
that seemed to subsequently be the one

259
00:14:11.841 --> 00:14:14.960
that was looked as to being
the lead surgeon


260
00:14:15.044 --> 00:14:17.896
that cared for President Kennedy.

261
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.433
The next person that I recall coming in

262
00:14:20.517 --> 00:14:22.001
was Dr. Bob McClelland.

263
00:14:22.085 --> 00:14:25.304
Dr. Perry and Dr. 
Baxter had just walked

264
00:14:25.388 --> 00:14:27.206
into that room ahead of me.

265
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:29.908
And Dr. Perry was standing
on the right side


266
00:14:29.992 --> 00:14:32.411
of the cart the president was lying on,

267
00:14:32.495 --> 00:14:35.665
Dr. Baxter opposite him on the left side.

268
00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:39.518
So they motioned me on through.

269
00:14:39.602 --> 00:14:42.255
And I pushed the door open
to Trauma Room 1,


270
00:14:42.339 --> 00:14:43.922
walked by Mrs. Kennedy,

271
00:14:44.006 --> 00:14:47.326
and was greeted by the horrific sight

272
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:52.165
of President Kennedy lying
on his back on a cart


273
00:14:52.249 --> 00:14:55.134
with an operating room light shining down

274
00:14:55.218 --> 00:14:57.670
on his bloody head.

275
00:14:57.754 --> 00:15:01.540
And I've still got that fixed
in my mind to this moment.


276
00:15:05.628 --> 00:15:08.681
The most dramatic things to me were

277
00:15:08.765 --> 00:15:11.717
the chaos in the emergency room,

278
00:15:11.801 --> 00:15:14.620
the Secret Service with their machine guns

279
00:15:14.704 --> 00:15:17.190
looking around frantically,

280
00:15:17.274 --> 00:15:22.095
the president lying on a surgical bed,

281
00:15:22.179 --> 00:15:26.065
and with Mrs. Kennedy sitting by

282
00:15:26.149 --> 00:15:30.403
with the flecks of the president's brain

283
00:15:30.487 --> 00:15:32.522
on her skirt.

284
00:15:35.124 --> 00:15:40.613
The whole atmosphere together
was very chaotic.


285
00:15:40.697 --> 00:15:43.482
The emergency room nurse,
Doris Nelson,


286
00:15:43.566 --> 00:15:45.418
was letting people in,

287
00:15:45.502 --> 00:15:48.521
and there was a policeman
or a Secret Service agent.


288
00:15:48.605 --> 00:15:50.556
I'm not sure which.

289
00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.159
That pit area was jammed

290
00:15:53.243 --> 00:15:55.961
with men in business suits,
shoulder to shoulder.


291
00:15:56.045 --> 00:15:59.198
And this uniformed man had just sort of

292
00:15:59.282 --> 00:16:00.999
unobtrusively slipped in.

293
00:16:01.083 --> 00:16:04.603
And I noticed that
handcuffed to his left wrist


294
00:16:04.687 --> 00:16:06.272
was a briefcase.

295
00:16:06.356 --> 00:16:10.476
And someone says, there's
the man with the nuclear codes.


296
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.078
We were maybe thinking
this was the first stage


297
00:16:13.162 --> 00:16:15.998
of some kind of Russian attack or whatnot.

298
00:16:16.899 --> 00:16:19.285
What was a wonderful welcome
in downtown Dallas


299
00:16:19.369 --> 00:16:22.054
has become a scene of indescribable horror

300
00:16:22.138 --> 00:16:25.057
as hundreds of people crowd
outside the back door


301
00:16:25.141 --> 00:16:27.726
to the emergency room
here at Parkland Hospital.


302
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:28.961
And people are wondering,

303
00:16:29.045 --> 00:16:31.063
is our president going to live?

304
00:16:35.051 --> 00:16:37.002
There is no certain road
to the presidency.


305
00:16:37.086 --> 00:16:38.504
There are no guarantees.

306
00:16:38.588 --> 00:16:40.273
The question really is,

307
00:16:40.357 --> 00:16:41.974
which candidate can meet the problems

308
00:16:42.058 --> 00:16:44.210
that the United States is
going to face in the '60s?


309
00:16:49.031 --> 00:16:52.818
I do not believe that any of us

310
00:16:52.902 --> 00:16:55.588
would exchange places
with any other people


311
00:16:55.672 --> 00:16:58.624
or any other generation.

312
00:16:58.708 --> 00:17:02.695
The energy, the faith, the devotion

313
00:17:02.779 --> 00:17:06.232
which we bring to this endeavor

314
00:17:06.316 --> 00:17:09.502
will light our country
and all who serve it.


315
00:17:09.586 --> 00:17:12.805
And the glow from that fire

316
00:17:12.889 --> 00:17:16.074
can truly light the world.

317
00:17:16.158 --> 00:17:19.212
We were talking about him that morning--

318
00:17:19.296 --> 00:17:23.015
the charisma that he created
and the new excitement


319
00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:26.352
that he was presenting for our country.

320
00:17:26.436 --> 00:17:30.656
I remember thinking,
this is really historical.


321
00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.159
I'm in the middle
of something really historical.


322
00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.712
This is the president, and I remember

323
00:17:53.796 --> 00:17:55.448
there was no expression,

324
00:17:55.532 --> 00:17:57.383
there was no movement of his face.

325
00:17:57.467 --> 00:18:00.353
His eyes were open,
and it was an impressive view


326
00:18:00.437 --> 00:18:02.255
that I'll never forget,

327
00:18:02.339 --> 00:18:05.858
because here was my hero,

328
00:18:05.942 --> 00:18:09.912
and it was a very sad situation.

329
00:18:12.415 --> 00:18:16.235
The first thing I noticed
was a very small wound


330
00:18:16.319 --> 00:18:18.337
in his neck in the front.

331
00:18:20.156 --> 00:18:23.742
I do remember that very early on,

332
00:18:23.826 --> 00:18:26.379
even when his clothes were still on,

333
00:18:26.463 --> 00:18:28.714
I saw the wound in his neck.

334
00:18:28.798 --> 00:18:32.050
We could tell that the wound
was in the front of the neck


335
00:18:32.134 --> 00:18:37.122
just above where the shirt and tie was.

336
00:18:37.206 --> 00:18:39.091
So it was visible to you.

337
00:18:39.175 --> 00:18:42.528
In my own mind,
the wound was pretty small,


338
00:18:42.612 --> 00:18:45.464
maybe a nickel, maybe a dime.

339
00:18:45.548 --> 00:18:49.067
And that small wound,
Malcolm originally thought


340
00:18:49.151 --> 00:18:51.287
it must be an entrance wound
because it was so small.


341
00:18:59.195 --> 00:19:02.848
And as I walked by, Dr. Perry
leaned across the president


342
00:19:02.932 --> 00:19:06.218
and handed me
a surgical retractor and said,


343
00:19:06.302 --> 00:19:09.588
Bob, would you go and stand
at the head of the cart


344
00:19:09.672 --> 00:19:12.791
and lean over and put
that retractor in the wound


345
00:19:12.875 --> 00:19:16.629
and pull it open so he
and Dr. Baxter could look down


346
00:19:16.713 --> 00:19:19.398
into the wound and see
what they needed to see.


347
00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:25.338
I saw Dr. Perry make the cut
right through the wound


348
00:19:25.422 --> 00:19:27.340
that we thought was an entrance wound.

349
00:19:27.424 --> 00:19:31.109
So Dr. Perry expanded this,
and we helped retract


350
00:19:31.193 --> 00:19:33.846
and helped hold things
and inserted the tube


351
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:35.665
and got an airway control.

352
00:19:43.205 --> 00:19:45.491
We were trying to save our president.

353
00:19:45.575 --> 00:19:47.726
And we were trying to do
everything we could


354
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:49.746
to save him.

355
00:19:51.213 --> 00:19:53.131
The thing that really hit me

356
00:19:53.215 --> 00:19:55.300
when I got to
the head of the cart

357
00:19:55.384 --> 00:19:58.371
was the wound in
the back of his head.

358
00:19:58.455 --> 00:20:01.540
I said, my God, have you seen
the back of his head?


359
00:20:01.624 --> 00:20:02.792
It's gone.

360
00:20:35.357 --> 00:20:37.175
What was striking, even more than Kennedy,

361
00:20:37.259 --> 00:20:39.812
was Mrs. Kennedy with blood splotched

362
00:20:39.896 --> 00:20:41.547
all over her pink coat.

363
00:20:41.631 --> 00:20:44.383
And that was kind of startling
to see her like that.


364
00:20:44.467 --> 00:20:48.086
As I recall,
Mrs. Kennedy was not emotional.


365
00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:51.724
My impression was that
she knew this could happen,


366
00:20:51.808 --> 00:20:57.329
and it had happened,
and she was prepared for it.


367
00:20:57.413 --> 00:20:59.064
Everyone should be trying to help Jack

368
00:20:59.148 --> 00:21:01.299
in whatever way they could,

369
00:21:01.383 --> 00:21:03.168
and that was the way
I could do it the best,


370
00:21:03.252 --> 00:21:06.939
by making it always
a climate of affection.


371
00:21:07.023 --> 00:21:10.075
I was really focused
on Jacqueline Kennedy.


372
00:21:10.159 --> 00:21:13.712
She took the center of attention

373
00:21:13.796 --> 00:21:15.448
because she was a beautiful lady

374
00:21:15.532 --> 00:21:20.318
in a dramatic, very distraught condition.

375
00:21:20.402 --> 00:21:23.689
But she was still very much
in command of herself


376
00:21:23.773 --> 00:21:25.924
and was not weeping or hysterical

377
00:21:26.008 --> 00:21:29.795
or anything as people might imagine.

378
00:21:29.879 --> 00:21:34.332
I do not think it altogether inappropriate

379
00:21:34.416 --> 00:21:38.203
to introduce myself to this audience.

380
00:21:38.287 --> 00:21:42.140
I am the man who accompanied
Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris.


381
00:21:42.224 --> 00:21:43.942
And I've enjoyed it.

382
00:21:45.728 --> 00:21:47.913
She had this pink suit on,

383
00:21:47.997 --> 00:21:50.115
and I wondered why
she wore a pink suit

384
00:21:50.199 --> 00:21:51.984
with the red gloves.

385
00:21:52.068 --> 00:21:53.886
And of course, looking a little closer,

386
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:57.422
you could see that the red
gloves were actually blood,


387
00:21:57.506 --> 00:21:58.957
and it was on her hands.

388
00:21:59.041 --> 00:22:01.293
She was splattered with blood,

389
00:22:01.377 --> 00:22:05.430
and I usually don't say this
because it's a bit gruesome,


390
00:22:05.514 --> 00:22:07.550
was gray matter was brain.

391
00:22:10.386 --> 00:22:12.404
Mrs. Kennedy, when she first came in

392
00:22:12.488 --> 00:22:14.673
with the president to Trauma Room 1,

393
00:22:14.757 --> 00:22:18.811
she was holding a large segment
of his cerebrum in her hand


394
00:22:18.895 --> 00:22:22.080
and handed it to Dr. Jenkins
when she came in.


395
00:22:22.164 --> 00:22:23.682
In fact, you've seen those pictures

396
00:22:23.766 --> 00:22:27.352
when she's climbing back
onto the rear of the car.


397
00:22:27.436 --> 00:22:31.389
People wonder why she was
retaining this piece of brain


398
00:22:31.473 --> 00:22:34.359
that had been blown out
of the president's head


399
00:22:34.443 --> 00:22:36.495
onto the rear deck of the limousine.

400
00:22:36.579 --> 00:22:39.397
And she was crawling back and came in

401
00:22:39.481 --> 00:22:41.767
with that piece of brain in her hand

402
00:22:41.851 --> 00:22:43.552
and handed it to Dr. Jenkins.

403
00:22:46.122 --> 00:22:49.274
He had a major wound
of his right side of his head


404
00:22:49.358 --> 00:22:51.944
that was wide-open
with brain and loss of skull


405
00:22:52.028 --> 00:22:55.013
and with the whole scalp peeled back.

406
00:22:55.097 --> 00:22:57.850
So it was a horrendous wound,
and it was obvious


407
00:22:57.934 --> 00:23:00.870
that probably, this was a lethal wound.

408
00:23:02.905 --> 00:23:04.890
I could look down at Kennedy,

409
00:23:04.974 --> 00:23:06.625
and it was apparent
that the top of his head


410
00:23:06.709 --> 00:23:07.793
looked like it was blown off.

411
00:23:07.877 --> 00:23:09.194
It was all bloody.

412
00:23:09.278 --> 00:23:11.429
And at that instant,
I felt like


413
00:23:11.513 --> 00:23:13.899
he was already dead when I saw him.

414
00:23:13.983 --> 00:23:18.904
The back half of his right
cerebral hemisphere was gone.


415
00:23:18.988 --> 00:23:21.373
And as I stood there, the right half

416
00:23:21.457 --> 00:23:24.009
of the cerebellum fell out of that hole

417
00:23:24.093 --> 00:23:26.511
in the back of
his head onto the cart.

418
00:23:26.595 --> 00:23:30.783
So this was obvious that this
was a mortal--a fatal wound.


419
00:23:34.336 --> 00:23:37.289
My initial impression, seeing two wounds,

420
00:23:37.373 --> 00:23:39.291
was, how would you put it together?

421
00:23:39.375 --> 00:23:42.127
Well, a small wound here,
a big wound back here.


422
00:23:42.211 --> 00:23:45.330
We thought that there was
an entrance wound in the neck


423
00:23:45.414 --> 00:23:47.165
and an exit wound in
the back of the head

424
00:23:47.249 --> 00:23:49.434
at that particular time,

425
00:23:49.518 --> 00:23:51.970
because I've seen a fair
number of gunshot wounds,


426
00:23:52.054 --> 00:23:55.073
and usually the entrance wound is smaller

427
00:23:55.157 --> 00:23:57.175
than the exit wound.

428
00:23:57.259 --> 00:24:00.813
I thought that he had a lethal injury.

429
00:24:00.897 --> 00:24:04.149
But I felt that you never know.

430
00:24:04.233 --> 00:24:06.318
So, you know, here's our president.

431
00:24:06.402 --> 00:24:08.537
So let's do everything we can.

432
00:24:11.007 --> 00:24:13.992
We were probably 10 or 12 minutes

433
00:24:14.076 --> 00:24:15.728
into the resuscitation.

434
00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:22.968
We'd done the tracheotomy.

435
00:24:23.052 --> 00:24:24.402
We'd gotten the IV going.

436
00:24:24.486 --> 00:24:26.204
We'd put in two chest tubes.

437
00:24:26.288 --> 00:24:28.306
And we had gotten the heart tracing.

438
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:32.144
By that time, we
got the EKG machine in,

439
00:24:32.228 --> 00:24:33.879
and there was just a straight line.

440
00:24:33.963 --> 00:24:35.013
A straight line.

441
00:24:35.097 --> 00:24:36.448
A straight line.

442
00:24:42.872 --> 00:24:46.524
He then obviously wasn't
breathing on his own at all.


443
00:24:46.608 --> 00:24:51.730
His head was cradled
in Dr. Jenkins' hands,


444
00:24:51.814 --> 00:24:57.019
and he murmured to me,
"Last rites, last rites."


445
00:24:58.888 --> 00:25:00.272
A call has been sent out

446
00:25:00.356 --> 00:25:03.108
from some of the top
surgical specialists in Dallas,


447
00:25:03.192 --> 00:25:06.912
and a call also
went out for a priest.

448
00:25:09.631 --> 00:25:12.685
And so we all agreed
we should pronounce him,


449
00:25:12.769 --> 00:25:14.953
and officially,
we would have Dr. Kemp Clark


450
00:25:15.037 --> 00:25:16.621
make that announcement.

451
00:25:16.705 --> 00:25:18.891
Dr. Clark took the responsibility

452
00:25:18.975 --> 00:25:20.993
because it was primarily a brain injury,

453
00:25:21.077 --> 00:25:22.828
and he's a neurosurgeon.

454
00:25:22.912 --> 00:25:25.197
And we felt like that was the wound

455
00:25:25.281 --> 00:25:28.333
that caused the demise.

456
00:25:28.417 --> 00:25:30.969
I think we all knew
that the president was dead,


457
00:25:31.053 --> 00:25:34.707
and it was just a matter of
who was going to make the call.


458
00:25:34.791 --> 00:25:37.209
And with that, he pronounced
the president dead.


459
00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:47.585
Then is when I was

460
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:51.890
emotionally affected.

461
00:26:11.193 --> 00:26:13.511
I mean, to see somebody die

462
00:26:13.595 --> 00:26:16.014
is something that we saw a lot of.

463
00:26:16.098 --> 00:26:19.351
But it was shocking to see
the most famous person


464
00:26:19.435 --> 00:26:22.988
in the world and his wife there.

465
00:26:23.072 --> 00:26:25.190
That's imprinted in my mind,

466
00:26:25.274 --> 00:26:27.625
and it's always been there.

467
00:26:27.709 --> 00:26:33.198
It was almost like a machine
that was roaring shut off.


468
00:26:33.282 --> 00:26:37.535
And there was a kind of
stillness in the room.


469
00:26:37.619 --> 00:26:42.491
And you know that that person
has left this world.


470
00:26:51.333 --> 00:26:54.319
They said, let's make
the time of death 1:00.


471
00:26:54.403 --> 00:26:56.688
And that was well before 1:00.

472
00:26:56.772 --> 00:26:59.357
And then they said,
well, that'll give Johnson time


473
00:26:59.441 --> 00:27:01.927
to get out of the hospital
and get to Air Force One


474
00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:04.113
and maybe be sworn in.

475
00:27:05.381 --> 00:27:07.632
I left Trauma Room 1

476
00:27:07.716 --> 00:27:11.837
right after we had decided
that he was dead.


477
00:27:11.921 --> 00:27:13.371
A gentleman walked up to me

478
00:27:13.455 --> 00:27:15.373
with a large badge in his hand,

479
00:27:15.457 --> 00:27:18.510
and he said, I'm with the FBI,

480
00:27:18.594 --> 00:27:20.545
and I need to call
J. Edgar Hoover


481
00:27:20.629 --> 00:27:23.281
and tell him the condition
of the president.


482
00:27:23.365 --> 00:27:25.550
And right behind him was another gentleman

483
00:27:25.634 --> 00:27:27.085
with a large badge, and he said,

484
00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:28.753
I'm with the Secret Service,

485
00:27:28.837 --> 00:27:30.789
and I need to call
Joseph Kennedy


486
00:27:30.873 --> 00:27:33.959
and tell him the condition of his son.

487
00:27:34.043 --> 00:27:36.428
And here they were asking me
the condition of the president,


488
00:27:36.512 --> 00:27:38.596
and I knew he was dead.

489
00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.332
I didn't want to be the first one

490
00:27:40.416 --> 00:27:43.668
to announce this to the world,
that he was dead.


491
00:27:46.655 --> 00:27:49.808
I think the most important part
was Mrs. Kennedy said


492
00:27:49.892 --> 00:27:52.110
she didn't want him pronounced
until a priest arrived.


493
00:27:52.194 --> 00:27:54.880
A priest had not arrived.

494
00:27:54.964 --> 00:27:57.850
So I told them,

495
00:27:57.934 --> 00:27:59.284
I said, he's not doing well.

496
00:28:01.803 --> 00:28:05.323
At that moment,
I was really in shock.


497
00:28:05.407 --> 00:28:07.559
And I just stood there.

498
00:28:07.643 --> 00:28:10.362
Everyone started exiting the room.

499
00:28:10.446 --> 00:28:12.697
Everyone was leaving.

500
00:28:12.781 --> 00:28:17.903
And before long,
Mrs. Kennedy then starts


501
00:28:17.987 --> 00:28:19.872
walking over towards the president,

502
00:28:19.956 --> 00:28:21.323
and I'm just standing there.

503
00:28:32.969 --> 00:28:36.188
Dr. Baxter and I saw
our opportunity to leave.


504
00:28:36.272 --> 00:28:38.023
But just as we began to do that,

505
00:28:38.107 --> 00:28:40.959
the door to Trauma
Room 1 came open again,

506
00:28:41.043 --> 00:28:42.711
and a priest came in.

507
00:28:50.319 --> 00:28:52.370
The Catholic priest comes in

508
00:28:52.454 --> 00:28:55.573
and does the last rites of the church.

509
00:28:55.657 --> 00:28:57.775
And we would have had
to push him out of the way


510
00:28:57.859 --> 00:28:59.577
in order to get out of the room.

511
00:28:59.661 --> 00:29:02.514
And so we froze against the wall

512
00:29:02.598 --> 00:29:06.218
and found ourselves,
inappropriately we felt,


513
00:29:06.302 --> 00:29:08.504
present at the president's last rites.

514
00:29:11.207 --> 00:29:14.659
Mrs. Kennedy stood across
next to Father Huber


515
00:29:14.743 --> 00:29:16.628
at the head of the president's cart.

516
00:29:16.712 --> 00:29:20.398
He leaned over and said into
the president's left ear...


517
00:29:20.482 --> 00:29:23.368
I forgive you your sins
in the name of the Father,


518
00:29:23.452 --> 00:29:25.570
and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost.

519
00:29:25.654 --> 00:29:29.607
His wife was standing there
during this entire time.


520
00:29:29.691 --> 00:29:32.444
And I couldn't hear
what Mrs. Kennedy asked,


521
00:29:32.528 --> 00:29:35.813
but Father Huber said to her very quietly,

522
00:29:35.897 --> 00:29:39.384
he said, yes, I've given him
conditional absolution.


523
00:29:39.468 --> 00:29:43.239
She grimaced when she heard
that word "conditional."


524
00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:57.735
He's covered up, but she takes his hand,

525
00:29:57.819 --> 00:30:00.272
and she does a ring ceremony.

526
00:30:00.356 --> 00:30:02.574
She exchanged a ring from her finger

527
00:30:02.658 --> 00:30:04.442
onto the president's finger

528
00:30:04.526 --> 00:30:07.645
and a ring from his finger onto hers.

529
00:30:07.729 --> 00:30:09.881
She stood next to his bare foot

530
00:30:09.965 --> 00:30:13.351
that was protruding out
from underneath the sheet.


531
00:30:13.435 --> 00:30:15.553
She stood there for a moment,
then leaned over


532
00:30:15.637 --> 00:30:17.922
and kissed his foot
and walked out of the room.


533
00:30:23.645 --> 00:30:25.497
Who was behind all of this?

534
00:30:25.581 --> 00:30:26.664
We didn't know that.

535
00:30:26.748 --> 00:30:28.100
They certainly didn't know it that day

536
00:30:28.184 --> 00:30:32.137
when they were ushering
Vice President Johnson


537
00:30:32.221 --> 00:30:33.605
out of the emergency room.

538
00:30:33.689 --> 00:30:36.941
He was rushed to Air Force One.

539
00:30:37.025 --> 00:30:41.246
Mr. and Mrs. Johnson hurried
out of the emergency ward,


540
00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:42.947
surrounded by Secret Service men,

541
00:30:43.031 --> 00:30:46.151
and were rushed off to the airport.

542
00:30:46.235 --> 00:30:47.352
I think they wanted him

543
00:30:47.436 --> 00:30:49.054
out of town as quickly as possible.

544
00:30:49.138 --> 00:30:51.423
But he couldn't get out of town
as quickly as possible


545
00:30:51.507 --> 00:30:53.558
because he wanted
Mrs. Kennedy with him,


546
00:30:53.642 --> 00:30:56.412
and Mrs. Kennedy didn't want
to leave the president.


547
00:31:02.818 --> 00:31:06.071
It felt like a bad dream,

548
00:31:06.155 --> 00:31:11.809
and I kept hoping that I would
awaken at any minute


549
00:31:11.893 --> 00:31:15.531
and find out that I had
just had a horrible nightmare.


550
00:31:17.433 --> 00:31:20.152
Nothing will ever erase the picture

551
00:31:20.236 --> 00:31:22.920
of my one time in the presence

552
00:31:23.004 --> 00:31:25.907
of the president and the first lady.

553
00:31:27.409 --> 00:31:29.561
I went outside the hospital

554
00:31:29.645 --> 00:31:34.299
and stood with the crowd
that had gathered.


555
00:31:34.383 --> 00:31:36.168
I didn't say anything.

556
00:31:36.252 --> 00:31:40.238
I felt like an ordinary person

557
00:31:40.322 --> 00:31:43.875
who had great admiration

558
00:31:43.959 --> 00:31:46.844
and love and respect
for President Kennedy,


559
00:31:46.928 --> 00:31:51.567
and my president had been
assassinated and was dead.


560
00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:56.321
This is official word.

561
00:31:56.405 --> 00:31:57.873
We repeat...

562
00:32:07.349 --> 00:32:10.635
The President
of the United States is dead.


563
00:32:10.719 --> 00:32:13.171
A flash from Dallas:

564
00:32:13.255 --> 00:32:16.208
two priests who were
with President Kennedy say


565
00:32:16.292 --> 00:32:17.709
he is dead.

566
00:32:17.793 --> 00:32:21.379
With the greatest regret, this flash:

567
00:32:21.463 --> 00:32:24.282
two priests who were
with President Kennedy say


568
00:32:24.366 --> 00:32:26.802
he has died of bullet wounds.

569
00:32:35.177 --> 00:32:38.730
From Dallas, Texas,
the flash, apparently official,


570
00:32:38.814 --> 00:32:40.898
President Kennedy died

571
00:32:40.982 --> 00:32:44.536
at 1:00 p.m.
Central Standard Time,


572
00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.339
2:00 Eastern Standard Time,

573
00:32:47.423 --> 00:32:50.091
some 38 minutes ago.

574
00:32:57.366 --> 00:33:00.718
We went back upstairs
and just kind of sat there


575
00:33:00.802 --> 00:33:03.788
and looked at one another,
as if, you know,


576
00:33:03.872 --> 00:33:06.924
did that really happen,
or was this a nightmare?


577
00:33:07.008 --> 00:33:10.895
The discussion was up
in the operating room lounge


578
00:33:10.979 --> 00:33:14.799
just to try to talk and determine

579
00:33:14.883 --> 00:33:17.902
how Kennedy had been shot
and where he had been shot


580
00:33:17.986 --> 00:33:20.004
and with what he had been shot,

581
00:33:20.088 --> 00:33:22.006
how many times had he been shot.

582
00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:24.709
And we were just
in the beginning of that

583
00:33:24.793 --> 00:33:26.244
when Dr. Perry got the call

584
00:33:26.328 --> 00:33:28.930
to see if he could come down
and meet with the press.


585
00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:44.396
So at the press conference,
Dr. Perry,


586
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.332
in describing the wound here,

587
00:33:47.416 --> 00:33:51.403
said that he thought that it
looked like an entrance wound.


588
00:33:51.487 --> 00:33:54.071
So we were thinking,
there were two wounds.


589
00:33:54.155 --> 00:33:56.674
Had to be an entrance wound
and an exit wound.


590
00:33:56.758 --> 00:33:58.776
That was the only way
we could put it together.


591
00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:03.248
And so I thought
it was an entrance wound.

592
00:34:03.332 --> 00:34:06.884
When he left the room,
someone came up to him


593
00:34:06.968 --> 00:34:12.190
who Dr. Perry thought
maybe was a Secret Service man.


594
00:34:12.274 --> 00:34:16.628
And he told Dr. Perry,
you must never, ever say that


595
00:34:16.712 --> 00:34:18.963
that was an entrance wound again

596
00:34:19.047 --> 00:34:20.598
if you know what's good for you.

597
00:34:22.918 --> 00:34:25.637
We are told that the gunshot wound,

598
00:34:25.721 --> 00:34:27.038
the fatal wound inflicted

599
00:34:27.122 --> 00:34:29.874
on the President of the United States,

600
00:34:29.958 --> 00:34:31.343
entered at the base of the throat

601
00:34:31.427 --> 00:34:35.664
and came out at the base
of the neck on the back side.


602
00:35:06.495 --> 00:35:09.213
Inside Trauma Room 1,
we have the Parkland doctors


603
00:35:09.297 --> 00:35:11.967
and staff trying to save
the president's life.


604
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:18.756
And they notice and they make
note of the fact that


605
00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.693
the back of the president's
head was missing.


606
00:35:21.777 --> 00:35:23.595
And within three to five hours,

607
00:35:23.679 --> 00:35:27.465
most of the staff at Parkland
memorialize their observations


608
00:35:27.549 --> 00:35:31.587
by writing down what,
in fact, they observed.


609
00:35:37.292 --> 00:35:40.412
I just wrote on
a progress note sheet of paper,


610
00:35:40.496 --> 00:35:42.947
like you would put in a patient's chart.

611
00:35:43.031 --> 00:35:45.634
I just said, this was an entrance wound.

612
00:35:47.869 --> 00:35:49.621
We were asked to turn
it in to Dr. Clark,

613
00:35:49.705 --> 00:35:51.155
the chief of neurosurgery,

614
00:35:51.239 --> 00:35:53.791
and I gave it to his secretary.

615
00:35:53.875 --> 00:35:55.627
There was no motive to lie.

616
00:35:55.711 --> 00:35:57.028
They had no interest in anything

617
00:35:57.112 --> 00:35:59.748
other than telling the truth.

618
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:03.601
The first wound described

619
00:36:03.685 --> 00:36:05.770
was a wound in
the back of the head

620
00:36:05.854 --> 00:36:08.139
and would seem to indicate
a shot from behind.


621
00:36:08.223 --> 00:36:10.308
But the doctors also said
there was a wound


622
00:36:10.392 --> 00:36:12.477
in the throat at the front,
which seemed to indicate


623
00:36:12.561 --> 00:36:14.211
a shot from the other direction.

624
00:36:14.295 --> 00:36:18.616
There was no outside influences at all

625
00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.918
to tell them what to
do or not to do

626
00:36:21.002 --> 00:36:23.921
as it related to their observations.

627
00:36:24.005 --> 00:36:26.023
So we have to
say that, if we're dealing

628
00:36:26.107 --> 00:36:28.893
with trustworthy people,
the Parkland doctors


629
00:36:28.977 --> 00:36:30.728
are about as trustworthy as you can get.

630
00:36:37.218 --> 00:36:42.039
This is Situation Room relay to wayside.

631
00:36:42.123 --> 00:36:45.977
We have report quoting
Mr. Kilduff in Dallas


632
00:36:46.061 --> 00:36:49.146
that the president is dead,

633
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:52.884
that he died about 35 minutes ago.

634
00:36:52.968 --> 00:36:56.788
Front office desires
plane return Washington.


635
00:36:56.872 --> 00:36:59.441
This is Situation Room out.

636
00:37:01.242 --> 00:37:05.863
Dr. Earl Rose, who was the
medical examiner at that time,


637
00:37:05.947 --> 00:37:09.667
had requested that the autopsy
be done in Dallas County.


638
00:37:09.751 --> 00:37:11.969
I think it was his opinion

639
00:37:12.053 --> 00:37:15.072
that if a murder occurs in Dallas County,

640
00:37:15.156 --> 00:37:17.509
the autopsy is done in Dallas County.

641
00:37:17.593 --> 00:37:20.177
Dr. Rose had been sitting in his office,

642
00:37:20.261 --> 00:37:23.014
which looked out onto a corridor

643
00:37:23.098 --> 00:37:26.451
that led to the exit and
the loading dock at Parkland.


644
00:37:26.535 --> 00:37:29.353
And he saw this little
procession coming along


645
00:37:29.437 --> 00:37:32.089
down the corridor,
heading toward the exit,


646
00:37:32.173 --> 00:37:34.258
and that consisted of the president,

647
00:37:34.342 --> 00:37:36.628
who had now been placed in his coffin,

648
00:37:36.712 --> 00:37:39.296
and Mrs. Kennedy was walking

649
00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.633
along the left side of that cart.

650
00:37:41.717 --> 00:37:43.300
Two Secret Service men were

651
00:37:43.384 --> 00:37:45.302
heading up the little procession,

652
00:37:45.386 --> 00:37:49.541
one of whom was carrying
a Thompson submachine gun.


653
00:37:49.625 --> 00:37:51.175
Well, when Dr. 
Rose saw that,

654
00:37:51.259 --> 00:37:54.178
he stepped out of his office
into the corridor,


655
00:37:54.262 --> 00:37:57.482
held his hand up
to ask them to stop,

656
00:37:57.566 --> 00:38:00.117
because, he said,
I'm required by law


657
00:38:00.201 --> 00:38:03.455
to tell you that any murder
that's committed


658
00:38:03.539 --> 00:38:06.891
in the state of Texas,
the victim must undergo


659
00:38:06.975 --> 00:38:09.761
a postmortem exam in this state.

660
00:38:09.845 --> 00:38:12.196
And they have a loud conversation,

661
00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:16.534
and I hear them saying,
we're doing the autopsy here.


662
00:38:16.618 --> 00:38:17.735
This is the state of Texas.

663
00:38:17.819 --> 00:38:19.904
The law is that he has the autopsy.

664
00:38:19.988 --> 00:38:21.506
And the Secret Service says, no way.

665
00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:23.074
We're taking him away.

666
00:38:23.158 --> 00:38:26.578
Then the Secret Service man
with the submachine gun


667
00:38:26.662 --> 00:38:29.413
walked slowly over to Dr. Rose

668
00:38:29.497 --> 00:38:32.684
and put his hands underneath his armpits

669
00:38:32.768 --> 00:38:35.352
and gently lifted him up off the floor

670
00:38:35.436 --> 00:38:39.123
and placed him over against
the wall of the corridor


671
00:38:39.207 --> 00:38:42.359
and then shook his finger in his face

672
00:38:42.443 --> 00:38:44.762
as if to say,
stand out of our way.

673
00:38:44.846 --> 00:38:46.664
And then they turned around

674
00:38:46.748 --> 00:38:51.019
and headed out the rear
entrance to the ambulance.


675
00:38:54.355 --> 00:38:57.609
So they were not about to leave
the president's body there


676
00:38:57.693 --> 00:38:58.910
for any purpose.

677
00:38:58.994 --> 00:39:00.845
They took him out of Dallas.

678
00:39:00.929 --> 00:39:04.165
Within 30 or 40 minutes, he was gone.

679
00:39:10.471 --> 00:39:12.757
Everything changed as soon as JFK's body

680
00:39:12.841 --> 00:39:15.259
left Parkland Hospital.

681
00:39:15.343 --> 00:39:18.029
So the Parkland physicians were no longer

682
00:39:18.113 --> 00:39:21.482
a part of the
story, so that's a problem.

683
00:39:23.585 --> 00:39:26.838
I'm Doug Horne, and, uh,

684
00:39:26.922 --> 00:39:30.407
I was successful in obtaining a job

685
00:39:30.491 --> 00:39:35.146
with the Assassination Records
Review Board in 1995.


686
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:38.516
I was kicked upstairs
and became the chief analyst


687
00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.885
for military records.

688
00:39:40.969 --> 00:39:43.054
The review board was tasked

689
00:39:43.138 --> 00:39:45.322
with ensuring
that proper searches were done


690
00:39:45.406 --> 00:39:47.692
by all the agencies of the government

691
00:39:47.776 --> 00:39:49.477
for assassination records.

692
00:40:05.526 --> 00:40:08.045
This country has not been told the truth

693
00:40:08.129 --> 00:40:10.481
about the JFK assassination.

694
00:40:10.565 --> 00:40:13.184
This is why I decided
I wanted to go work


695
00:40:13.268 --> 00:40:15.319
for the Review Board.

696
00:40:15.403 --> 00:40:18.389
The Parkland observations
that I think constitute


697
00:40:18.473 --> 00:40:20.157
some of the very best evidence we have

698
00:40:20.241 --> 00:40:23.327
of what really happened
to President Kennedy.


699
00:40:23.411 --> 00:40:26.297
Some of the Parkland doctors believe,

700
00:40:26.381 --> 00:40:28.800
based on what they
saw in Trauma Room 1,

701
00:40:28.884 --> 00:40:31.869
that President Kennedy was
shot from the front.


702
00:40:31.953 --> 00:40:37.675
They have not deviated from
what they observed in 1963,


703
00:40:37.759 --> 00:40:39.577
60 years ago.

704
00:40:39.661 --> 00:40:41.445
Well, the Parkland doctors
are the first ones


705
00:40:41.529 --> 00:40:43.581
that saw the president when he came in.

706
00:40:43.665 --> 00:40:44.949
They saw his body.

707
00:40:45.033 --> 00:40:46.618
And the observation, for the most part,

708
00:40:46.702 --> 00:40:48.786
is that there was a large
head wound in the rear


709
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:51.856
and there was an entry wound
in the throat.


710
00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.358
This is the prevailing wisdom

711
00:40:54.442 --> 00:40:57.294
coming out of Parkland that day.

712
00:40:57.378 --> 00:41:00.264
My name is Matt Crumpton,
and I am an attorney.


713
00:41:00.348 --> 00:41:03.334
So I've got a background
in looking at evidence


714
00:41:03.418 --> 00:41:04.736
and analyzing it.

715
00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.438
And I was always interested in the case,

716
00:41:07.522 --> 00:41:09.641
where I started to do a deep dive

717
00:41:09.725 --> 00:41:12.576
in the same way that
a jury would look at a case.


718
00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:14.511
And years later,

719
00:41:14.595 --> 00:41:16.981
I continued to look at it
as the case progressed,


720
00:41:17.065 --> 00:41:18.249
more and more records came out.

721
00:41:21.236 --> 00:41:23.888
This is a beast of a subject.
There are people


722
00:41:23.972 --> 00:41:25.522
who have spent
their whole lives doing this.


723
00:41:25.606 --> 00:41:28.726
And Doug Horne was very, very involved

724
00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:30.594
in the granular details.

725
00:41:30.678 --> 00:41:33.698
He's had access to, you know, information

726
00:41:33.782 --> 00:41:36.734
that the vast majority
of people in this case


727
00:41:36.818 --> 00:41:38.302
have not had access to.

728
00:41:38.386 --> 00:41:41.372
I think the medical evidence
in the Kennedy assassination


729
00:41:41.456 --> 00:41:43.340
is the most enduring mystery.

730
00:41:43.424 --> 00:41:45.677
And if you're a person like me

731
00:41:45.761 --> 00:41:48.012
who has studied it for decades,

732
00:41:48.096 --> 00:41:49.747
you certainly think it's probably

733
00:41:49.831 --> 00:41:51.816
the most interesting evidence

734
00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:55.019
because it's fraught with
conflict and contradiction,


735
00:41:55.103 --> 00:41:57.288
and there are some real mysteries

736
00:41:57.372 --> 00:41:58.656
to try to unravel here.

737
00:42:01.409 --> 00:42:04.328
And the only way to do that
is to go issue by issue.


738
00:42:04.412 --> 00:42:06.764
So we start with the body.

739
00:42:09.885 --> 00:42:13.037
Parkland was stunned by what happened

740
00:42:13.121 --> 00:42:15.973
when the Secret Service, essentially,

741
00:42:16.057 --> 00:42:18.509
takes a body out of town.

742
00:42:18.593 --> 00:42:21.662
They didn't expect that to happen.

743
00:42:24.099 --> 00:42:26.483
When it comes to matters
of national security,


744
00:42:26.567 --> 00:42:29.620
they step on the toes of the
state government all the time.


745
00:42:29.704 --> 00:42:32.824
So even if it wasn't a conspiracy,

746
00:42:32.908 --> 00:42:35.927
the federal government wanted
to have absolute control


747
00:42:36.011 --> 00:42:39.130
over the body of the President
of the United States.


748
00:42:39.214 --> 00:42:40.832
They don't care what some county coroner

749
00:42:40.916 --> 00:42:43.567
in Dallas says to them.

750
00:42:43.651 --> 00:42:46.137
The Secret Service knew that
it was going to move the body


751
00:42:46.221 --> 00:42:48.305
to Washington for the autopsy.

752
00:42:48.389 --> 00:42:51.175
That was their intention right away.

753
00:42:51.259 --> 00:42:54.445
Washington, D.C. was
controlling the narrative


754
00:42:54.529 --> 00:42:58.800
on what had happened
to JFK in Dealey Plaza.


755
00:43:17.385 --> 00:43:20.404
Mrs. John F. Kennedy left the hospital

756
00:43:20.488 --> 00:43:21.873
at approximately the same time

757
00:43:21.957 --> 00:43:24.641
the coffin carrying the body
of her husband left.


758
00:43:24.725 --> 00:43:27.745
The coffin went
to a private air installation


759
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:29.931
at Dallas's Love Field.

760
00:43:31.066 --> 00:43:34.618
Lyndon Johnson actually told
Kennedy's press secretary,


761
00:43:34.702 --> 00:43:36.821
Malcolm Kilduff, at the hospital

762
00:43:36.905 --> 00:43:39.390
that he wanted to get out
of there as soon as possible


763
00:43:39.474 --> 00:43:42.526
because he didn't know if
the Russians were behind this


764
00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:44.661
and it was an international conspiracy

765
00:43:44.745 --> 00:43:46.197
and that he was in danger
and they were trying


766
00:43:46.281 --> 00:43:48.332
to take down the whole government.

767
00:43:48.416 --> 00:43:50.734
There was Lyndon Johnson
running around on the floor,


768
00:43:50.818 --> 00:43:52.837
saying, "There's been a conspiracy!

769
00:43:52.921 --> 00:43:55.672
I gotta get out
to Air Force One right away."


770
00:43:55.756 --> 00:43:57.608
At the time
JFK was assassinated,


771
00:43:57.692 --> 00:44:00.778
it's just the height of the Cold War.

772
00:44:00.862 --> 00:44:03.915
Our goal is not the victory of might,

773
00:44:03.999 --> 00:44:06.150
but the vindication of right,

774
00:44:06.234 --> 00:44:08.886
not peace at the expense of freedom,

775
00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:10.687
but both peace and freedom.

776
00:44:10.771 --> 00:44:14.859
So the biggest fear was,
was the USSR involved?


777
00:44:14.943 --> 00:44:17.361
Did they play a role in the assassination?

778
00:44:17.445 --> 00:44:21.298
That's what was on everyone's mind.

779
00:44:21.382 --> 00:44:23.067
Vice President Johnson is expected

780
00:44:23.151 --> 00:44:26.203
to be sworn in as president
aboard an airliner


781
00:44:26.287 --> 00:44:29.306
before flying back
to the nation's capital.


782
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:30.875
The bronze casket was put

783
00:44:30.959 --> 00:44:33.377
on Air Force One, the president's plane,

784
00:44:33.461 --> 00:44:36.497
where the swearing in
ceremonies were held.


785
00:44:39.234 --> 00:44:41.318
Lyndon B. Johnson has been sworn in

786
00:44:41.402 --> 00:44:42.786
as the President of the United States.

787
00:44:56.117 --> 00:44:59.921
The body will go to Bethesda
Naval Hospital, we are told.


788
00:45:02.991 --> 00:45:07.278
Once that body was placed
on the airplane at Love Field,


789
00:45:07.362 --> 00:45:09.246
everything changed,

790
00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:12.083
and the federal government
controlled the narrative


791
00:45:12.167 --> 00:45:13.717
that was given to the American people

792
00:45:13.801 --> 00:45:15.319
about what had happened.

793
00:45:20.508 --> 00:45:23.260
I went home and
told my wife what happened

794
00:45:23.344 --> 00:45:27.264
and started being in shock,

795
00:45:27.348 --> 00:45:29.066
staying in shock.

796
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:30.501
I started watching television.

797
00:45:30.585 --> 00:45:32.536
I watched every bit
of what was going on.

798
00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:34.305
I couldn't believe that, indeed,

799
00:45:34.389 --> 00:45:36.407
I was a part of that.

800
00:45:36.491 --> 00:45:38.709
I really hadn't realized

801
00:45:38.793 --> 00:45:41.245
that this had been on television.

802
00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:43.647
And that's when I realized that everybody

803
00:45:43.731 --> 00:45:46.317
in the world knew
about it by that time.

804
00:45:46.401 --> 00:45:48.019
Walter Cronkite was following it.

805
00:45:48.103 --> 00:45:50.554
Everybody around the world
was following it.


806
00:45:50.638 --> 00:45:53.590
In Dallas, a suspect in a Dallas theater

807
00:45:53.674 --> 00:45:55.659
pulled a gun, shot one policeman,

808
00:45:55.743 --> 00:45:58.062
wounded another, and--
but was captured.


809
00:45:58.146 --> 00:46:01.132
And when he was captured,
he yelled, "It's all over now,"


810
00:46:01.216 --> 00:46:02.466
and screaming hysterically,

811
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:05.236
was taken into custody by the police.

812
00:46:08.923 --> 00:46:11.808
The man has been identified
as Lee H. Oswald.


813
00:46:11.892 --> 00:46:14.745
Lee Harvey Oswald had been arrested,

814
00:46:14.829 --> 00:46:16.713
and so we were beginning to try

815
00:46:16.797 --> 00:46:18.549
to put some of this together,

816
00:46:18.633 --> 00:46:20.817
because when I went home that afternoon,

817
00:46:20.901 --> 00:46:23.787
I didn't know anything
about Lee Harvey Oswald


818
00:46:23.871 --> 00:46:27.424
and that he was the accused assassin.

819
00:46:27.508 --> 00:46:28.592
The man was brought immediately

820
00:46:28.676 --> 00:46:30.627
to police headquarters.

821
00:46:30.711 --> 00:46:33.164
That man said to have been
an employee of the building


822
00:46:33.248 --> 00:46:35.899
from which the shot
is believed to have come.


823
00:46:35.983 --> 00:46:39.570
This is 24-year-old
Lee H. Oswald.


824
00:46:39.654 --> 00:46:41.538
Now, here is the gun

825
00:46:41.622 --> 00:46:44.692
that police say was used
to kill the president.


826
00:46:46.461 --> 00:46:47.911
No, I have not been charged with that.

827
00:46:47.995 --> 00:46:50.514
In fact, nobody has
said that to me yet.

828
00:46:50.598 --> 00:46:51.848
The first thing
I heard about it was


829
00:46:51.932 --> 00:46:55.586
when the newspaper reporters
in the hall, uh,


830
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:57.955
asked me that question.

831
00:46:58.039 --> 00:46:59.991
Within an hour of the assassination,

832
00:47:00.075 --> 00:47:01.492
Oswald was arrested,

833
00:47:01.576 --> 00:47:03.560
and it was all across the media

834
00:47:03.644 --> 00:47:05.963
that Oswald was the shooter,

835
00:47:06.047 --> 00:47:07.931
firing three shots from behind,

836
00:47:08.015 --> 00:47:09.400
hitting President Kennedy

837
00:47:09.484 --> 00:47:11.168
and then
Governor John Connally.


838
00:47:11.252 --> 00:47:14.338
And it makes sense that
it's Oswald because he worked


839
00:47:14.422 --> 00:47:16.640
at the Texas
School Book Depository.


840
00:47:16.724 --> 00:47:20.495
So, I mean, you've got to take
a really close look at Oswald.


841
00:47:22.797 --> 00:47:25.216
In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired

842
00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.819
at President Kennedy's
motorcade in downtown Dallas.


843
00:47:28.903 --> 00:47:33.457
News media said that Lee Harvey Oswald was

844
00:47:33.541 --> 00:47:36.511
the lone assassin, case closed.

845
00:47:43.684 --> 00:47:46.870
And as we know,
it was not case closed

846
00:47:46.954 --> 00:47:49.106
at that particular point.

847
00:47:56.131 --> 00:47:58.382
It was a 2
hour and 13 minute flight

848
00:47:58.466 --> 00:48:01.385
to get from Dallas, Texas,
to Andrews Air Force Base


849
00:48:01.469 --> 00:48:03.671
south of Washington, D.C.

850
00:48:25.059 --> 00:48:27.811
The Secret Service, in the
White House Situation Room,


851
00:48:27.895 --> 00:48:30.181
ordered that the autopsy be done

852
00:48:30.265 --> 00:48:31.882
at Bethesda Naval Hospital.

853
00:48:31.966 --> 00:48:35.552
And here is--
here is the plane now.


854
00:48:35.636 --> 00:48:37.421
Made the flight back from Dallas.

855
00:48:44.545 --> 00:48:47.664
What you see is a special
truck that has been moved up


856
00:48:47.748 --> 00:48:50.101
to the rear of the presidential jet

857
00:48:50.185 --> 00:48:54.105
on which the coffin will be brought out.

858
00:48:54.189 --> 00:48:59.009
Casket is dark brown in color,
slightly reddish.


859
00:48:59.093 --> 00:49:05.266
A Navy ambulance is being
drawn up just near the truck.


860
00:49:06.234 --> 00:49:10.721
Behind the casket is
Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy.


861
00:49:10.805 --> 00:49:13.990
To her right is her brother-in-law,

862
00:49:14.074 --> 00:49:16.860
the Attorney General
Robert Kennedy.


863
00:49:16.944 --> 00:49:23.334
Mrs. Kennedy is apparently
getting into the ambulance.


864
00:49:23.418 --> 00:49:28.439
And the Navy ambulance
moves off with the casket.


865
00:49:28.523 --> 00:49:31.342
Now being dramatized here
at Andrews Air Force Base


866
00:49:31.426 --> 00:49:33.677
as the new president
addresses the microphones.


867
00:49:33.761 --> 00:49:35.011
Ladies and gentlemen,

868
00:49:35.095 --> 00:49:37.514
the President of the United States.

869
00:49:37.598 --> 00:49:41.118
I will do my best.

870
00:49:41.202 --> 00:49:45.122
That is all I can do.

871
00:49:45.206 --> 00:49:50.044
I ask for your help and God's.

872
00:49:53.648 --> 00:49:56.300
So at 6:20, Lyndon leaves.

873
00:49:56.384 --> 00:49:57.901
At 6:21, the lights go out,

874
00:49:57.985 --> 00:49:59.970
and there's no more
TV coverage.


875
00:50:00.054 --> 00:50:01.538
And so it would have been after that

876
00:50:01.622 --> 00:50:03.174
that the president's body,

877
00:50:03.258 --> 00:50:06.177
either in sheets
or a body bag--it's unclear--


878
00:50:06.261 --> 00:50:08.179
would have been placed in a helicopter

879
00:50:08.263 --> 00:50:10.881
and quickly flown
to Bethesda Naval Hospital.


880
00:50:10.965 --> 00:50:12.883
This is Doug Horne's theory,

881
00:50:12.967 --> 00:50:16.853
that the body was switched
out of the bronze casket


882
00:50:16.937 --> 00:50:20.524
on the plane
and put into a shipping casket.


883
00:50:20.608 --> 00:50:24.161
And so the bronze casket
is taken to Bethesda


884
00:50:24.245 --> 00:50:27.898
in the ambulance
with Jackie and RFK in it.


885
00:50:27.982 --> 00:50:29.700
But that casket is actually empty,

886
00:50:29.784 --> 00:50:30.967
is what the theory says.

887
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:37.341
The Secret Service decided,

888
00:50:37.425 --> 00:50:39.910
while the plane was
en route to Washington,


889
00:50:39.994 --> 00:50:42.045
that the body would go by helicopter.

890
00:50:42.129 --> 00:50:45.015
Now, the shipping casket
arrived 20 minutes


891
00:50:45.099 --> 00:50:48.118
before the Dallas
bronze casket to Bethesda.


892
00:50:48.202 --> 00:50:51.322
This is a--
this is a shell game.


893
00:50:51.406 --> 00:50:54.658
Now, this is obviously
a very controversial theory.


894
00:50:54.742 --> 00:50:56.793
The idea is that the body arrived

895
00:50:56.877 --> 00:50:59.430
20 minutes early to Bethesda.

896
00:51:05.386 --> 00:51:07.971
Sergeant Boyajian
and his Marines were sent


897
00:51:08.055 --> 00:51:11.442
to Bethesda to provide physical security

898
00:51:11.526 --> 00:51:13.027
for the president's autopsy.

899
00:51:17.932 --> 00:51:22.118
And he wrote that the casket
arrived at 1835 hours.


900
00:51:22.202 --> 00:51:26.623
That's military time for 6:35 p.m.

901
00:51:26.707 --> 00:51:30.461
And when the motorcade arrived at 6:55,

902
00:51:30.545 --> 00:51:33.897
Secret Service agents recorded
that time in their reports,


903
00:51:33.981 --> 00:51:35.632
and all the newspapermen recorded

904
00:51:35.716 --> 00:51:37.033
that time in their reports.

905
00:51:37.117 --> 00:51:39.169
So these two times are firmly established.

906
00:51:39.253 --> 00:51:42.373
The primary documents that are relied on

907
00:51:42.457 --> 00:51:45.893
for this assertion would be
the Boyajian report.


908
00:51:47.628 --> 00:51:50.080
I think it makes
this not a crazy thing.

909
00:51:50.164 --> 00:51:52.883
The person who was in charge
of the working party,


910
00:51:52.967 --> 00:51:55.486
who off-loaded
the shipping casket at 6:35,


911
00:51:55.570 --> 00:51:57.454
was Petty Officer Dennis David.

912
00:51:57.538 --> 00:52:01.558
As I recall, it was a black,
unmarked ambulance.


913
00:52:01.642 --> 00:52:04.728
And we off-loaded a casket,

914
00:52:04.812 --> 00:52:07.163
and it was carried into the autopsy room.

915
00:52:07.247 --> 00:52:11.802
This casket is a plain, gray box,

916
00:52:11.886 --> 00:52:14.170
if you will, a metal box.

917
00:52:14.254 --> 00:52:15.639
Anybody who's ever been to Vietnam

918
00:52:15.723 --> 00:52:17.641
would know what I'm talking about.

919
00:52:17.725 --> 00:52:19.310
We shipped hundreds of bodies out of there

920
00:52:19.394 --> 00:52:20.577
in the same type of casket.

921
00:52:20.661 --> 00:52:22.646
It's just a plain shipping casket.

922
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:26.082
It definitely wasn't the fancy casket

923
00:52:26.166 --> 00:52:28.969
that they showed on TV,
which I saw later on.


924
00:52:30.337 --> 00:52:35.058
So the question that really matters is,

925
00:52:35.142 --> 00:52:37.794
what happened to President Kennedy's body

926
00:52:37.878 --> 00:52:40.831
at the hospital between
the time it really arrived,


927
00:52:40.915 --> 00:52:44.435
6:35 p.m., and the time
the official autopsy started,


928
00:52:44.519 --> 00:52:46.670
which was shortly after 8:00?

929
00:52:46.754 --> 00:52:49.340
The theory is that, between 6:30 and 8:00,

930
00:52:49.424 --> 00:52:51.742
the body was physically tampered with...

931
00:52:53.528 --> 00:52:56.279
So that any evidence
that would show a front shot,


932
00:52:56.363 --> 00:52:58.815
like the wound here,

933
00:52:58.899 --> 00:53:02.753
any of that evidence would be obscured.

934
00:53:02.837 --> 00:53:04.955
Any shots that aren't consistent

935
00:53:05.039 --> 00:53:07.090
with coming from
the sixth floor sniper's nest


936
00:53:07.174 --> 00:53:10.894
at the School Book Depository
had to be removed.


937
00:53:10.978 --> 00:53:14.998
Because some of
the Parkland doctors believe


938
00:53:15.082 --> 00:53:17.251
that President Kennedy was
shot from the front.


939
00:53:19.153 --> 00:53:22.373
By the time JFK's body
arrives at Bethesda,


940
00:53:22.457 --> 00:53:25.676
the narrative is clearly
that the president was shot


941
00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.479
by a lone gunman from above and behind.

942
00:53:28.563 --> 00:53:33.283
And so the body needs
to support that narrative.


943
00:53:33.367 --> 00:53:35.686
And one way to
support it is to remove

944
00:53:35.770 --> 00:53:37.388
all of the metal in the body

945
00:53:37.472 --> 00:53:40.424
that indicates there was a crossfire.

946
00:53:40.508 --> 00:53:43.077
You're gonna sanitize
the crime scene, in effect.


947
00:53:44.411 --> 00:53:48.098
24-year-old
Lee Harvey Oswald charged


948
00:53:48.182 --> 00:53:49.966
with the murder of the president.

949
00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:51.435
Oswald was arrested less than two hours

950
00:53:51.519 --> 00:53:52.936
after the president was shot.

951
00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:55.071
Police say Oswald worked
in the building from which


952
00:53:55.155 --> 00:53:57.841
the shots that killed
the president were fired.


953
00:53:57.925 --> 00:54:00.210
That gun is a powerful military rifle,

954
00:54:00.294 --> 00:54:02.029
which police found in the building.

955
00:54:04.364 --> 00:54:07.117
He has not confessed.
He has made no statement.


956
00:54:07.201 --> 00:54:09.920
Charges of murder have been
accepted against him.


957
00:54:10.004 --> 00:54:12.856
- I, uh--
- I don't know what this is all about.


958
00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:15.175
Did you shoot the president?

959
00:54:17.444 --> 00:54:19.563
Investigation and arrest

960
00:54:19.647 --> 00:54:22.332
has been rapid, to say the least.

961
00:54:27.387 --> 00:54:29.806
The pathologists for
President Kennedy's autopsy


962
00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:32.042
were two Navy pathologists,

963
00:54:32.126 --> 00:54:34.077
Commander James J. Humes

964
00:54:34.161 --> 00:54:37.581
and
Commander J. Thornton Boswell.


965
00:54:37.665 --> 00:54:41.117
Humes and Boswell were not
very well versed at all


966
00:54:41.201 --> 00:54:42.419
on gunshots.

967
00:54:42.503 --> 00:54:44.588
They had not done many gunshots at all.

968
00:54:44.672 --> 00:54:48.692
The problem is, they weren't
forensic pathologists.


969
00:54:48.776 --> 00:54:50.827
They were people that would do an autopsy

970
00:54:50.911 --> 00:54:53.129
if your aunt died of a heart attack,

971
00:54:53.213 --> 00:54:55.999
not a high-level government official

972
00:54:56.083 --> 00:54:58.101
that gets shot in the head,

973
00:54:58.185 --> 00:54:59.736
where you need to know the entrance wound,

974
00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.337
the exit wound, the bullet path,

975
00:55:01.421 --> 00:55:04.641
so you can determine later
whence the bullets came.


976
00:55:04.725 --> 00:55:06.242
It is hard to believe that

977
00:55:06.326 --> 00:55:08.311
you've got the President
of the United States,


978
00:55:08.395 --> 00:55:11.782
and the autopsy is going to be done

979
00:55:11.866 --> 00:55:14.985
by no practicing forensic pathologists.

980
00:55:15.069 --> 00:55:18.088
I believe that Humes and Boswell

981
00:55:18.172 --> 00:55:20.891
were chosen to do the autopsy

982
00:55:20.975 --> 00:55:24.094
because they were under military control.

983
00:55:24.178 --> 00:55:25.929
The results of the autopsy could be

984
00:55:26.013 --> 00:55:28.198
controlled by the military,

985
00:55:28.282 --> 00:55:30.818
which means controlled
by the federal government.


986
00:55:32.753 --> 00:55:35.438
James Jenkins was a hospital corpsman

987
00:55:35.522 --> 00:55:37.340
who was assisting with the autopsy,

988
00:55:37.424 --> 00:55:41.344
and he's on record saying that he believed

989
00:55:41.428 --> 00:55:44.832
that the military was really
in control of the autopsy.


990
00:55:46.867 --> 00:55:49.319
There's so many people that are now gone.

991
00:55:49.403 --> 00:55:51.888
You know, when I'm gone,
there will be nobody else


992
00:55:51.972 --> 00:55:54.074
from the autopsy team at all.

993
00:55:56.677 --> 00:56:02.499
It was my job to do
for them what they requested


994
00:56:02.583 --> 00:56:06.970
without actually being told
to do it every time.


995
00:56:07.054 --> 00:56:10.541
So my focus was on

996
00:56:10.625 --> 00:56:12.943
exactly what was going on at that table,

997
00:56:13.027 --> 00:56:15.345
doing what I was asked to do,

998
00:56:15.429 --> 00:56:17.147
listening to what they were doing,

999
00:56:17.231 --> 00:56:20.100
and anticipating a request.

1000
00:56:23.137 --> 00:56:25.421
In those days, the military was,

1001
00:56:25.505 --> 00:56:28.324
if you were told
to do something, you did it,


1002
00:56:28.408 --> 00:56:29.392
or else.

1003
00:56:29.476 --> 00:56:31.895
And the "or else" was not pleasant.

1004
00:56:31.979 --> 00:56:34.097
Military doctors follow orders.

1005
00:56:34.181 --> 00:56:35.666
If you don't, your career is over.

1006
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:39.169
I believe that Humes and Boswell received

1007
00:56:39.253 --> 00:56:40.737
a very firm set of instructions

1008
00:56:40.821 --> 00:56:44.941
before President Kennedy's
body arrived at 6:35.


1009
00:56:45.025 --> 00:56:48.178
You will not report shots from the front.

1010
00:56:48.262 --> 00:56:50.881
You will only report shots from behind.

1011
00:56:50.965 --> 00:56:53.183
We already have a man arrested.

1012
00:56:53.267 --> 00:56:55.085
That's the way it has to be.

1013
00:56:55.169 --> 00:56:57.554
You'll be doing a patriotic
duty for your country.


1014
00:56:57.638 --> 00:56:59.590
They're engaged in a charade.

1015
00:56:59.674 --> 00:57:03.760
The charade is to pretend like
you're doing a real autopsy


1016
00:57:03.844 --> 00:57:05.395
and come up with results that say

1017
00:57:05.479 --> 00:57:07.463
there was one shooter
from above and behind


1018
00:57:07.547 --> 00:57:10.634
and there were no gunmen from the front.

1019
00:57:10.718 --> 00:57:13.136
Humes had one paramount task
he had to perform


1020
00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:15.471
before the autopsy began at 8:00

1021
00:57:15.555 --> 00:57:18.241
That was to remove
President Kennedy's brain


1022
00:57:18.325 --> 00:57:21.945
and remove any evidence

1023
00:57:22.029 --> 00:57:24.247
in the form of shots from the front.

1024
00:57:24.331 --> 00:57:26.149
So in any standard autopsy,

1025
00:57:26.233 --> 00:57:28.051
when there's a gunshot wound involved,

1026
00:57:28.135 --> 00:57:30.854
the tracks of the wounds
would be dissected


1027
00:57:30.938 --> 00:57:33.123
so that we could see the trajectory

1028
00:57:33.207 --> 00:57:36.760
and see where the bullet
actually went within the body.


1029
00:57:36.844 --> 00:57:40.430
After Dr. Humes removed
President Kennedy's brain


1030
00:57:40.514 --> 00:57:43.066
to take out all the bullet
fragments he could find,


1031
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:45.101
he then put the
brain back in the head

1032
00:57:45.185 --> 00:57:47.904
so that it could be inside the body

1033
00:57:47.988 --> 00:57:50.206
at the beginning of the 8:00 autopsy.

1034
00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:54.044
There were no metal fragments,

1035
00:57:54.128 --> 00:57:57.848
no bullets, no partial bullets,

1036
00:57:57.932 --> 00:58:01.417
anything of significance that were found.

1037
00:58:09.076 --> 00:58:11.795
It was very tense that night.

1038
00:58:11.879 --> 00:58:13.563
The atmosphere was very tense.

1039
00:58:13.647 --> 00:58:17.233
And it was not
so much the fact is

1040
00:58:17.317 --> 00:58:20.103
that the president had been assassinated.

1041
00:58:20.187 --> 00:58:24.107
It was a contention
between the military officers


1042
00:58:24.191 --> 00:58:26.209
that Dr. Humes had come in with

1043
00:58:26.293 --> 00:58:28.211
and Dr. Humes himself.

1044
00:58:28.295 --> 00:58:29.980
He was constantly being called back

1045
00:58:30.064 --> 00:58:32.482
to talk to one of the people.

1046
00:58:32.566 --> 00:58:33.750
It was jam-packed.

1047
00:58:33.834 --> 00:58:35.418
It was very hysterical.

1048
00:58:35.502 --> 00:58:38.138
We were interfered with constantly, yes.

1049
00:58:55.355 --> 00:58:59.575
When I got to review the autopsy report,

1050
00:58:59.659 --> 00:59:03.279
the x-rays, and most significantly,

1051
00:59:03.363 --> 00:59:05.281
the photographs that were taken,

1052
00:59:05.365 --> 00:59:08.251
it was the first
time that I really cried,

1053
00:59:08.335 --> 00:59:09.519
had tears in my eyes,

1054
00:59:09.603 --> 00:59:13.056
because he was such a young person,

1055
00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:14.590
had done so much for the country,

1056
00:59:14.674 --> 00:59:18.795
and was just taken out
of the prime of his life.


1057
00:59:18.879 --> 00:59:20.463
My name is Michael Baden.

1058
00:59:20.547 --> 00:59:24.600
I am a physician and forensic pathologist.

1059
00:59:24.684 --> 00:59:30.673
And I was asked to head
the forensic pathology unit


1060
00:59:30.757 --> 00:59:34.477
that would investigate
the autopsy findings.


1061
00:59:34.561 --> 00:59:37.547
The House Select Committee
on Assassinations


1062
00:59:37.631 --> 00:59:40.450
investigation took place 15 years

1063
00:59:40.534 --> 00:59:43.219
after the death of President Kennedy.

1064
00:59:43.303 --> 00:59:46.356
And in the course of our investigation,

1065
00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:50.460
the bottom line was, we determined that

1066
00:59:50.544 --> 00:59:53.897
President Kennedy had been struck

1067
00:59:53.981 --> 00:59:56.466
by two bullets from behind

1068
00:59:56.550 --> 00:59:59.602
and only two bullets from behind.

1069
00:59:59.686 --> 01:00:01.738
I simply cannot agree with his reasoning

1070
01:00:01.822 --> 01:00:06.276
because he had to overrule and abandon

1071
01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.711
the personal observations
of the Parkland doctors,


1072
01:00:08.795 --> 01:00:11.447
who said there was a large exit wound

1073
01:00:11.531 --> 01:00:13.083
in the right rear of the head.

1074
01:00:13.167 --> 01:00:15.585
He examined photographs of the brain,

1075
01:00:15.669 --> 01:00:18.054
and when Dr. Baden noted
that there was no damage


1076
01:00:18.138 --> 01:00:20.290
to the right cerebellum.

1077
01:00:20.374 --> 01:00:25.195
The central conclusions were
unanimously agreed to


1078
01:00:25.279 --> 01:00:28.182
by eight of the panel members.

1079
01:00:31.751 --> 01:00:35.638
Bethesda was kind of a secret autopsy.

1080
01:00:35.722 --> 01:00:38.809
The people doing
the autopsy were not trained.


1081
01:00:38.893 --> 01:00:41.677
And then the many politicians
and other people


1082
01:00:41.761 --> 01:00:44.214
who were there were not knowledgeable

1083
01:00:44.298 --> 01:00:46.282
about how an autopsy should be done.

1084
01:00:50.737 --> 01:00:53.924
I agree with Dr. 
Baden about one thing.

1085
01:00:54.008 --> 01:00:58.778
The autopsy was under the thumb
of military authority.


1086
01:01:05.252 --> 01:01:07.971
Jim Jenkins saw
Dr. Humes remove the brain


1087
01:01:08.055 --> 01:01:13.143
shortly after 8:00,
at which point Dr. Humes says,


1088
01:01:13.227 --> 01:01:14.878
"The brain's fallen out in my hands."

1089
01:01:14.962 --> 01:01:17.780
You know, it almost
fell out in his hand.

1090
01:01:17.864 --> 01:01:20.250
And at that time, I noticed

1091
01:01:20.334 --> 01:01:23.253
the brain stem hadn't been torn,

1092
01:01:23.337 --> 01:01:24.955
it had been severed.

1093
01:01:25.039 --> 01:01:27.590
But it had been severed
on two different sides.


1094
01:01:27.674 --> 01:01:29.759
So I just assumed
that the bullet had severed


1095
01:01:29.843 --> 01:01:32.662
the brain stem,
and I was a little surprised


1096
01:01:32.746 --> 01:01:36.599
when I saw that it had been
actually surgically cut.


1097
01:01:36.683 --> 01:01:40.470
Jim Jenkins' opinion was
that this brain must have


1098
01:01:40.554 --> 01:01:43.206
been removed earlier that evening.

1099
01:01:43.290 --> 01:01:46.843
The audience was
extremely disturbed by this,


1100
01:01:46.927 --> 01:01:49.345
to the point where Dr. Humes,
I think, panicked.


1101
01:01:49.429 --> 01:01:52.548
And so he announced that it's apparent

1102
01:01:52.632 --> 01:01:54.184
there's been surgery of the head area.

1103
01:01:54.268 --> 01:01:56.552
And at this point,
Dr. Boswell looks up


1104
01:01:56.636 --> 01:01:58.421
and says to the gallery in the morgue,

1105
01:01:58.505 --> 01:02:00.290
"Was there surgery in Dallas?"

1106
01:02:00.374 --> 01:02:02.258
So he's playing along with Humes.

1107
01:02:02.342 --> 01:02:03.960
These guys knew there was
no surgery in Dallas.


1108
01:02:04.044 --> 01:02:05.195
They did it themselves.

1109
01:02:05.279 --> 01:02:08.031
So the FBI agents heard him say that

1110
01:02:08.115 --> 01:02:09.783
and put it in their written report.

1111
01:02:14.621 --> 01:02:16.606
It was just a real short statement.

1112
01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:20.860
Humes said, "There's been
a surgery in the head area."


1113
01:02:22.396 --> 01:02:24.680
They're just literally
saying what Dr. Humes said,


1114
01:02:24.764 --> 01:02:27.383
which is, it appears
there was surgery done.


1115
01:02:27.467 --> 01:02:30.120
So the question is, what does that mean?

1116
01:02:30.204 --> 01:02:32.956
And that goes into the theory
of body alteration


1117
01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:36.359
to obscure any evidence
that would lead them


1118
01:02:36.443 --> 01:02:39.262
to the conclusion of shots from the front

1119
01:02:39.346 --> 01:02:41.697
or from any other direction.

1120
01:02:41.781 --> 01:02:44.467
The third pathologist was
a forensic pathologist.


1121
01:02:44.551 --> 01:02:47.337
This is Pierre Finck, from the Army.

1122
01:02:47.421 --> 01:02:48.738
But generally, he wasn't

1123
01:02:48.822 --> 01:02:51.291
conducting autopsies himself either.

1124
01:02:53.027 --> 01:02:55.611
Dr. Humes and Dr. Finck,

1125
01:02:55.695 --> 01:02:57.931
they began to examine the head.

1126
01:03:03.103 --> 01:03:05.388
And they found a wound.

1127
01:03:05.472 --> 01:03:08.258
It was on the
right side of the head.

1128
01:03:08.342 --> 01:03:12.628
It was slightly above the ear
and forward of the ear,


1129
01:03:12.712 --> 01:03:14.797
just barely in the hairline.

1130
01:03:14.881 --> 01:03:18.301
I thought he was shot from the front

1131
01:03:18.385 --> 01:03:21.437
because entrance wounds are small

1132
01:03:21.521 --> 01:03:24.240
and exit wounds are large.

1133
01:03:24.324 --> 01:03:26.376
And it was a small wound.

1134
01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:28.911
And Dr. Finck made a comment,

1135
01:03:28.995 --> 01:03:31.447
"That probably was from a bullet."

1136
01:03:31.531 --> 01:03:33.416
That was the wound they were examining

1137
01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:35.785
when Dr. Humes was called to talk

1138
01:03:35.869 --> 01:03:39.822
with the individuals in the gallery.

1139
01:03:39.906 --> 01:03:42.692
It was just below
his hairline, right up here.


1140
01:03:42.776 --> 01:03:45.728
And the entry wound was
about the size of a dime.


1141
01:03:45.812 --> 01:03:48.264
It was clearly a wound
of entrance, not of exit.


1142
01:03:48.348 --> 01:03:50.100
And he came back.

1143
01:03:50.184 --> 01:03:51.867
And no time during the autopsy

1144
01:03:51.951 --> 01:03:54.637
did they ever go back to this one.

1145
01:03:54.721 --> 01:03:57.773
It was not listed in the official autopsy.

1146
01:03:57.857 --> 01:04:00.276
They never made it
into the official record.


1147
01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.146
That bullet would have been
removed during the surgery.


1148
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:06.882
The Parkland doctors said
that there was an exit wound


1149
01:04:06.966 --> 01:04:09.819
in the back right side of Kennedy's head.

1150
01:04:09.903 --> 01:04:12.622
The entrance wound would have
been about here.


1151
01:04:12.706 --> 01:04:15.858
Whereas that's not what
the autopsy showed in Bethesda.


1152
01:04:15.942 --> 01:04:19.429
The autopsy report
determined that the bullet


1153
01:04:19.513 --> 01:04:21.864
had entered the back of the head

1154
01:04:21.948 --> 01:04:27.270
and exited the right side of the skull.

1155
01:04:27.354 --> 01:04:29.572
And the Parkland doctors thought there was

1156
01:04:29.656 --> 01:04:31.474
a big hole there, but the autopsy showed

1157
01:04:31.558 --> 01:04:34.244
there was just a normal
half an inch bullet wound


1158
01:04:34.328 --> 01:04:36.846
in the back of the head.

1159
01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:40.050
I tend to believe
what the Parkland doctors said,


1160
01:04:40.134 --> 01:04:43.153
which causes some problems and confusion

1161
01:04:43.237 --> 01:04:45.038
when you go look at the autopsy.

1162
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:55.331
When President Kennedy
arrives at Bethesda,


1163
01:04:55.415 --> 01:04:59.869
Dr. Humes, as normally,
looks at the front of the body,


1164
01:04:59.953 --> 01:05:03.373
then turns the body over
to examine the back.


1165
01:05:03.457 --> 01:05:06.242
That back wound was located

1166
01:05:06.326 --> 01:05:10.613
right at the top of
the shoulder blade back here,


1167
01:05:10.697 --> 01:05:13.349
halfway between the top of that point

1168
01:05:13.433 --> 01:05:15.918
and the spinal column.

1169
01:05:16.002 --> 01:05:20.056
The bullet that goes in
the back goes in a few inches,


1170
01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:23.093
and Dr. Humes probed it,

1171
01:05:23.177 --> 01:05:25.661
which you're not supposed to do
with bullet wounds


1172
01:05:25.745 --> 01:05:27.597
because you can make artificial tracks.

1173
01:05:27.681 --> 01:05:30.800
Dr. Humes could not
find any point of exit

1174
01:05:30.884 --> 01:05:32.435
anywhere else in the body.

1175
01:05:32.519 --> 01:05:33.836
In other words, it dead-ended.

1176
01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:36.890
They found that the wound
didn't go anywhere.


1177
01:05:40.093 --> 01:05:42.845
They weren't really
interested, it seems, that--


1178
01:05:42.929 --> 01:05:47.517
on how it happened,
where it happened from.


1179
01:05:47.601 --> 01:05:50.586
Nobody had mentioned
whether he had got shot


1180
01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:52.939
in the front or the back
or the side or what.


1181
01:06:04.718 --> 01:06:06.636
I first saw the neck wound

1182
01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:09.272
when Dr. Boswell and I unwrapped the body.

1183
01:06:09.356 --> 01:06:13.075
It looked like a gaping gash.

1184
01:06:13.159 --> 01:06:14.977
We didn't examine it.

1185
01:06:15.061 --> 01:06:17.480
We were told not to bother with it;

1186
01:06:17.564 --> 01:06:18.681
it was a trach.

1187
01:06:18.765 --> 01:06:20.650
So we didn't examine it.

1188
01:06:20.734 --> 01:06:24.120
Specifically,
Pierre Finck was told to stop


1189
01:06:24.204 --> 01:06:25.621
when they were looking at the neck wound.

1190
01:06:25.705 --> 01:06:26.656
It's just a tracheotomy.

1191
01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:28.057
Stop.
Move on.


1192
01:06:28.141 --> 01:06:30.826
There was a big, gaping tracheotomy wound

1193
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:32.328
in the anterior neck.

1194
01:06:32.412 --> 01:06:33.763
They obliterated--

1195
01:06:33.847 --> 01:06:36.266
literally obliterated that wound.

1196
01:06:36.350 --> 01:06:40.736
The problem is, the first
thing that Bethesda didn't do


1197
01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:43.239
was call
Parkland Emergency Department


1198
01:06:43.323 --> 01:06:45.959
and ask them, what did
you do to the body?

1199
01:06:47.261 --> 01:06:49.812
Had they called us first,

1200
01:06:49.896 --> 01:06:53.749
yes, they would have known that
there was a wound in the neck.


1201
01:06:53.833 --> 01:06:56.018
They didn't have all the information.

1202
01:07:01.608 --> 01:07:05.828
That Saturday morning after
the assassination on Friday,


1203
01:07:05.912 --> 01:07:08.764
we were just sitting
in our office, talking.


1204
01:07:08.848 --> 01:07:12.168
Dr. Perry got a phone call
from Washington,


1205
01:07:12.252 --> 01:07:15.471
from Dr. Boswell, one of the pathologists.

1206
01:07:15.555 --> 01:07:20.576
The call was that, we have
a rifle injury to the back,


1207
01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:23.045
but we don't see an exit wound.

1208
01:07:23.129 --> 01:07:26.081
And we also have
a gunshot wound to the head.


1209
01:07:26.165 --> 01:07:30.720
We didn't know, when we were
called from Bethesda,


1210
01:07:30.804 --> 01:07:33.789
that there was a
gunshot wound to the back

1211
01:07:33.873 --> 01:07:36.242
just to the right of the midline.

1212
01:07:38.011 --> 01:07:40.029
We didn't know there was
a wound in the back


1213
01:07:40.113 --> 01:07:42.164
because after the president died,

1214
01:07:42.248 --> 01:07:44.467
we didn't feel like it was appropriate

1215
01:07:44.551 --> 01:07:46.769
for us to do any more examining

1216
01:07:46.853 --> 01:07:48.371
or turning of the body or whatever.

1217
01:07:48.455 --> 01:07:52.775
The Naval Hospital in Bethesda didn't know

1218
01:07:52.859 --> 01:07:55.211
that there was a wound
in the front of the neck


1219
01:07:55.295 --> 01:07:57.413
because Dr. Perry's incision
had gone through it,


1220
01:07:57.497 --> 01:07:59.749
and they didn't pick up
on the fact that there was


1221
01:07:59.833 --> 01:08:01.951
a little divot in the bottom
part of that wound


1222
01:08:02.035 --> 01:08:04.053
that was what we thought was
the entrance wound.


1223
01:08:04.137 --> 01:08:08.424
But Bethesda,
they said it was their opinion


1224
01:08:08.508 --> 01:08:13.547
that the neck wound came from
the back and out the front.


1225
01:08:29.963 --> 01:08:32.181
If the autopsy had been done in Dallas,

1226
01:08:32.265 --> 01:08:35.050
Dr. Rose would have
immediately been told that


1227
01:08:35.134 --> 01:08:37.853
that was a wound, and so he
could have put that together.


1228
01:08:37.937 --> 01:08:39.655
I just think the clarification
would have been


1229
01:08:39.739 --> 01:08:41.791
a little better upfront

1230
01:08:41.875 --> 01:08:44.043
if it had been done in Dallas County.

1231
01:08:46.279 --> 01:08:49.499
So when the Bethesda
pathologists called Parkland,


1232
01:08:49.583 --> 01:08:52.768
they both found out something
that the other didn't know.


1233
01:08:52.852 --> 01:08:54.970
So the Parkland doctors were not aware

1234
01:08:55.054 --> 01:08:57.607
of the wound in Kennedy's back,

1235
01:08:57.691 --> 01:09:01.444
and the Bethesda
autopsy doctors were not aware


1236
01:09:01.528 --> 01:09:05.648
that the tracheotomy was done
over an existing wound


1237
01:09:05.732 --> 01:09:07.116
in Kennedy's throat.

1238
01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.918
Dr. Humes originally concluded

1239
01:09:09.002 --> 01:09:10.353
one shot to the head from behind

1240
01:09:10.437 --> 01:09:12.422
and one shot in the upper back
from behind,


1241
01:09:12.506 --> 01:09:14.256
which did not exit the body.

1242
01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:15.758
He changed his conclusions

1243
01:09:15.842 --> 01:09:18.594
following the phone calls to Dr. Perry

1244
01:09:18.678 --> 01:09:21.163
and decided that a bullet transited

1245
01:09:21.247 --> 01:09:24.334
President Kennedy's body
from high in his back


1246
01:09:24.418 --> 01:09:26.936
and came out the throat.

1247
01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:30.340
The problem is that the evidence shows

1248
01:09:30.424 --> 01:09:33.309
that the wound was actually
lower and to the right,


1249
01:09:33.393 --> 01:09:35.811
such that the exit wound,
if there was one,


1250
01:09:35.895 --> 01:09:37.747
would have been closer
to the president's chest.


1251
01:09:37.831 --> 01:09:39.666
It wouldn't have been at his throat.

1252
01:09:44.137 --> 01:09:47.156
So we have to explain
this inconsistency somehow.


1253
01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:49.925
This is something that,
anyone who's studied the case


1254
01:09:50.009 --> 01:09:51.994
agrees that this is a major issue.

1255
01:09:52.078 --> 01:09:54.930
And it's determined that
the Warren Commission's gonna


1256
01:09:55.014 --> 01:09:56.683
figure out what happened.

1257
01:10:00.654 --> 01:10:03.172
President Johnson quickly
appointed a commission


1258
01:10:03.256 --> 01:10:05.975
to discover the real facts
of the assassination,


1259
01:10:06.059 --> 01:10:08.844
a commission of seven Americans
so distinguished


1260
01:10:08.928 --> 01:10:11.747
that their conclusions must
be above suspicion,


1261
01:10:11.831 --> 01:10:14.283
or so it was thought.

1262
01:10:14.367 --> 01:10:18.287
My general impression was
that the Warren Commission


1263
01:10:18.371 --> 01:10:22.392
was set up perhaps
to kind of get this over with.


1264
01:10:22.476 --> 01:10:23.826
I, like many other people,

1265
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:27.430
thought that this was
kind of a slapdash study


1266
01:10:27.514 --> 01:10:30.866
that was done to just kind of
cover things up,


1267
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:33.268
you know, sort of look at what happened

1268
01:10:33.352 --> 01:10:35.270
and make a fairly quick conclusion

1269
01:10:35.354 --> 01:10:38.124
and get it out of the people
in the country's minds.


1270
01:10:39.726 --> 01:10:42.712
The Warren Commission did
interview the Parkland doctors,


1271
01:10:42.796 --> 01:10:44.547
not all of them, but many of them.

1272
01:10:44.631 --> 01:10:45.881
And they got their perspective,

1273
01:10:45.965 --> 01:10:48.217
including that those doctors
thought there was


1274
01:10:48.301 --> 01:10:50.820
an exit wound in the back
of the president's head.


1275
01:10:50.904 --> 01:10:53.088
The assassination
of President Kennedy was,


1276
01:10:53.172 --> 01:10:56.592
inevitably, a mystery story
on a grand scale.


1277
01:10:56.676 --> 01:10:59.294
Parkland Hospital doctors
were quoted as saying


1278
01:10:59.378 --> 01:11:00.996
they thought at least one bullet entered

1279
01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.032
Mr. Kennedy's neck from the front.

1280
01:11:03.116 --> 01:11:05.535
All this mattered, because if there were

1281
01:11:05.619 --> 01:11:07.136
any shots from the overpass,

1282
01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:09.204
if there were more than three shots,

1283
01:11:09.288 --> 01:11:12.742
then Oswald had to have had an accomplice.

1284
01:11:12.826 --> 01:11:15.310
There were concerns in the United States

1285
01:11:15.394 --> 01:11:20.115
about there being a conspiracy
about there being two shooters,


1286
01:11:20.199 --> 01:11:22.251
one shooting
President Kennedy,


1287
01:11:22.335 --> 01:11:23.919
one shooting
Governor Connally,


1288
01:11:24.003 --> 01:11:26.121
or whether there was a conspiracy,

1289
01:11:26.205 --> 01:11:30.760
be it of Russians or Cubans or Castro

1290
01:11:30.844 --> 01:11:34.313
or some rogue government agency.

1291
01:11:50.063 --> 01:11:52.147
I think the problem is that they're left

1292
01:11:52.231 --> 01:11:56.452
with only two bullets to do
all of the damage to two men.


1293
01:11:56.536 --> 01:11:59.489
The known wounds were
a shot in the back

1294
01:11:59.573 --> 01:12:01.023
and a shot in the head.

1295
01:12:01.107 --> 01:12:03.125
And they're trying to account
for those two wounds,


1296
01:12:03.209 --> 01:12:05.895
plus Governor Connally's wounds,

1297
01:12:05.979 --> 01:12:07.697
with two bullets.

1298
01:12:07.781 --> 01:12:09.064
The only way to do that is

1299
01:12:09.148 --> 01:12:11.366
to have one bullet strike both men.

1300
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:15.137
So an ambitious junior
counselor, Arlen Specter,


1301
01:12:15.221 --> 01:12:17.907
invents the single bullet theory

1302
01:12:17.991 --> 01:12:20.576
to solve a shortage of evidence.

1303
01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:23.513
In the 1960s, Specter gained
national attention


1304
01:12:23.597 --> 01:12:25.915
for his work on the Warren Commission,

1305
01:12:25.999 --> 01:12:27.617
investigating the assassination

1306
01:12:27.701 --> 01:12:29.018
of President John F. Kennedy,

1307
01:12:29.102 --> 01:12:31.687
as coauthor of the single bullet theory,

1308
01:12:31.771 --> 01:12:35.508
supporting the belief there
was only one shooter involved.


1309
01:12:37.010 --> 01:12:38.928
He decides he wants a bullet

1310
01:12:39.012 --> 01:12:40.630
that hit
President Kennedy first


1311
01:12:40.714 --> 01:12:42.998
to be the one that hit Governor Connally.

1312
01:12:43.082 --> 01:12:46.001
And he twisted himself in knots

1313
01:12:46.085 --> 01:12:47.603
trying to sell that story.

1314
01:12:47.687 --> 01:12:51.273
The possibility of one bullet
having inflicted the wounds


1315
01:12:51.357 --> 01:12:54.076
on both the president's neck
and the governor's body


1316
01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.045
came in a very gradual way.

1317
01:12:56.129 --> 01:12:59.248
The trajectory was such
that it was almost certain


1318
01:12:59.332 --> 01:13:01.383
that the bullet which came out
of the president's neck


1319
01:13:01.467 --> 01:13:04.086
with great velocity
would have had to have hit


1320
01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:07.874
either the car or someone in the car.

1321
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:19.068
Well, the single bullet
theory is sheer, absolute,


1322
01:13:19.152 --> 01:13:20.803
unadulterated nonsense.

1323
01:13:20.887 --> 01:13:23.539
You have the bullet coming
out of John Kennedy,


1324
01:13:23.623 --> 01:13:26.742
moving then downward
and to the left, and yet


1325
01:13:26.826 --> 01:13:29.579
it slams into John Connally
behind the right armpit.


1326
01:13:29.663 --> 01:13:31.581
Well, Connally was sitting
directly in front of Kennedy.


1327
01:13:31.665 --> 01:13:33.849
So you've got to have the
bullet coming out of Kennedy,


1328
01:13:33.933 --> 01:13:36.586
stopping abruptly in midair,
turning to the right,


1329
01:13:36.670 --> 01:13:39.521
coming back about 20 inches,
stopping again,


1330
01:13:39.605 --> 01:13:41.056
turning around now to the left,

1331
01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:42.291
and going into Connally.

1332
01:13:42.375 --> 01:13:44.193
So that's the single bullet theory.

1333
01:13:44.277 --> 01:13:46.696
It is better than any roller coaster ride

1334
01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:49.531
that anybody has ever seen
anywhere in the world.


1335
01:13:49.615 --> 01:13:52.802
It is a bullet that rightfully deserves

1336
01:13:52.886 --> 01:13:55.638
the characterization that
we critics have given to it--


1337
01:13:55.722 --> 01:13:57.072
a magic bullet.

1338
01:13:57.156 --> 01:13:58.574
The big issue was,

1339
01:13:58.658 --> 01:14:00.475
is this an entrance wound
or an exit wound?


1340
01:14:00.559 --> 01:14:03.212
It was very small.
And we were always taught


1341
01:14:03.296 --> 01:14:06.882
that an exit wound is larger
than an entrance wound.


1342
01:14:06.966 --> 01:14:10.485
To me, it's just inconceivable

1343
01:14:10.569 --> 01:14:11.921
that the first shot

1344
01:14:12.005 --> 01:14:14.323
that went through his neck
entered my back.


1345
01:14:14.407 --> 01:14:15.791
I don't believe that.
I never will believe that.


1346
01:14:15.875 --> 01:14:18.144
They can't run enough tests
to make me believe that.


1347
01:14:19.813 --> 01:14:22.064
I don't think my impressions have changed

1348
01:14:22.148 --> 01:14:24.499
from the day of the assassination.

1349
01:14:24.583 --> 01:14:29.655
I've always thought that this
looked like an entrance wound.


1350
01:14:31.257 --> 01:14:34.409
Without a single bullet
theory to wound both men,


1351
01:14:34.493 --> 01:14:37.479
there has to be at least one
additional assassin.


1352
01:14:37.563 --> 01:14:40.599
And the Warren Commission
couldn't have that.


1353
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:45.387
The Warren report hinges

1354
01:14:45.471 --> 01:14:47.522
on the single bullet theory being true.

1355
01:14:47.606 --> 01:14:51.794
If it's not true, then we're
left with either a conspiracy


1356
01:14:51.878 --> 01:14:53.262
or just a bunch of question marks

1357
01:14:53.346 --> 01:14:56.049
as if it was never investigated at all.

1358
01:14:57.150 --> 01:15:00.269
On September 24, 1964,

1359
01:15:00.353 --> 01:15:02.137
the commission presented its findings

1360
01:15:02.221 --> 01:15:04.306
in the form of this report
to the president.


1361
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:07.076
"We concluded that, in
the absence of solid evidence,


1362
01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:09.462
there was no second gunman."

1363
01:15:12.999 --> 01:15:14.650
I don't remember the exact moment

1364
01:15:14.734 --> 01:15:17.519
that I heard the results
of the Warren Commission.


1365
01:15:17.603 --> 01:15:20.956
But I was aware that
it wasn't the full truth.


1366
01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.158
The conclusion
of the Warren Report is that


1367
01:15:23.242 --> 01:15:25.094
the Parkland doctors must have just been

1368
01:15:25.178 --> 01:15:27.329
incorrect in their conclusion.

1369
01:15:27.413 --> 01:15:30.565
Even President Lyndon Johnson
had serious questions


1370
01:15:30.649 --> 01:15:32.935
about the single bullet theory.

1371
01:15:33.019 --> 01:15:34.970
He told
Senator Richard Russell,


1372
01:15:35.054 --> 01:15:36.505
who was on the Warren Commission,

1373
01:15:36.589 --> 01:15:39.458
during a recorded phone call,
that he didn't believe it.


1374
01:15:48.034 --> 01:15:51.486
The problem is--
the inconsistency


1375
01:15:51.570 --> 01:15:55.241
is that Johnson still believed
that Oswald acted alone.


1376
01:15:57.243 --> 01:16:00.162
The Warren Commission started
with a conclusion


1377
01:16:00.246 --> 01:16:02.564
that Oswald did it
and he did it alone.

1378
01:16:02.648 --> 01:16:05.768
And they then worked to confirm that,

1379
01:16:05.852 --> 01:16:07.169
and then they disregarded

1380
01:16:07.253 --> 01:16:08.788
substantial evidence to the contrary.

1381
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:13.542
Certain people in our government tampered

1382
01:16:13.626 --> 01:16:16.411
with critical evidence
in order to make sure


1383
01:16:16.495 --> 01:16:17.980
the American people
would not know the truth


1384
01:16:18.064 --> 01:16:21.183
about who murdered the president.

1385
01:16:21.267 --> 01:16:23.018
And that's about as bad as it gets.

1386
01:16:24.971 --> 01:16:27.489
I'm talking about photographs
that don't look correct,


1387
01:16:27.573 --> 01:16:29.491
that look like they must have
been altered.


1388
01:16:29.575 --> 01:16:33.829
The photographs and x-rays
that we see are not consistent


1389
01:16:33.913 --> 01:16:36.766
with what the Parkland doctors
and many other people


1390
01:16:36.850 --> 01:16:38.400
who were there at Bethesda say.

1391
01:16:38.484 --> 01:16:41.370
When I saw the autopsy pictures,

1392
01:16:41.454 --> 01:16:45.307
my first response was,
I wanted to tell everybody


1393
01:16:45.391 --> 01:16:48.710
that that didn't reflect
what actually transpired.


1394
01:16:48.794 --> 01:16:50.813
I noted a wound when
I came into the room,

1395
01:16:50.897 --> 01:16:53.348
which was at the right
posterior portion of the head.


1396
01:16:53.432 --> 01:16:56.585
There was a massive wound
at the back of his head.


1397
01:16:56.669 --> 01:16:59.254
The two pictures that
I've seen that you showed me


1398
01:16:59.338 --> 01:17:01.423
that are supposedly from the archives

1399
01:17:01.507 --> 01:17:03.525
are not what I saw that night.

1400
01:17:03.609 --> 01:17:05.627
Now, I don't know where
those pictures came from.


1401
01:17:05.711 --> 01:17:06.896
It had a big hole in it.

1402
01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:09.198
This whole area was gone.

1403
01:17:09.282 --> 01:17:11.733
This part of the head was gone.

1404
01:17:11.817 --> 01:17:13.568
There was no scalp there.

1405
01:17:13.652 --> 01:17:15.470
How could all these people,

1406
01:17:15.554 --> 01:17:17.406
including the doctors at Parkland,

1407
01:17:17.490 --> 01:17:20.042
conclude that the back
of the head was missing?


1408
01:17:20.126 --> 01:17:21.243
And then we go to Bethesda,

1409
01:17:21.327 --> 01:17:22.511
and all of a sudden, it's patched up.

1410
01:17:22.595 --> 01:17:23.412
What happened?

1411
01:17:23.496 --> 01:17:24.914
In order to probe that,

1412
01:17:24.998 --> 01:17:27.416
you had to go back to Parkland

1413
01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.651
and speak to these doctors.

1414
01:17:45.518 --> 01:17:47.870
When I saw the autopsy pictures,

1415
01:17:47.954 --> 01:17:51.106
I thought somebody had really
tampered with the whole thing,


1416
01:17:51.190 --> 01:17:53.342
and it made me very suspicious

1417
01:17:53.426 --> 01:17:57.479
because it didn't look anything
like what I saw there.


1418
01:17:57.563 --> 01:17:59.915
And they had also completely sewed up

1419
01:17:59.999 --> 01:18:04.386
the temporoparietal side
of his head, and it was closed.


1420
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:07.189
And I said, how can they do--
why would they do that?


1421
01:18:07.273 --> 01:18:09.324
The cerebellum was not protruding.

1422
01:18:09.408 --> 01:18:12.061
We examined the cerebellum
photographically,


1423
01:18:12.145 --> 01:18:13.328
and it was intact.

1424
01:18:13.412 --> 01:18:15.097
Maybe the left lobe was,

1425
01:18:15.181 --> 01:18:16.966
but the right lobe had fallen out.

1426
01:18:17.050 --> 01:18:18.033
I saw that.

1427
01:18:18.117 --> 01:18:19.234
He's wrong.

1428
01:18:19.318 --> 01:18:20.870
There was no gaping hole,

1429
01:18:20.954 --> 01:18:22.537
and there was no cerebellum

1430
01:18:22.621 --> 01:18:25.274
that fell out on the car, period.

1431
01:18:25.358 --> 01:18:26.842
Andrew Purdy was counsel

1432
01:18:26.926 --> 01:18:28.743
to the House
Assassinations Committee.


1433
01:18:28.827 --> 01:18:31.046
He says the Dallas doctors are wrong.

1434
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:32.581
When you think of the body

1435
01:18:32.665 --> 01:18:35.417
as being face up and you think,
particularly in Dallas,


1436
01:18:35.501 --> 01:18:37.719
of the amount of blood
that was involved there,


1437
01:18:37.803 --> 01:18:40.856
people couldn't distinguish
where things were.


1438
01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:43.458
It must have been
a terrible, tragic sight.


1439
01:18:43.542 --> 01:18:46.628
It was very hard for people to recollect

1440
01:18:46.712 --> 01:18:49.498
exactly where what was
when that wasn't their purpose.


1441
01:18:49.582 --> 01:18:51.466
Their purpose was
to save the president's life,


1442
01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:54.136
and these recollections
afterwards are faulty.


1443
01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:56.171
Who is that last guy?

1444
01:18:56.255 --> 01:18:57.940
- Who is that guy?
- Is he a neurosurgeon?


1445
01:18:59.558 --> 01:19:03.178
The wound, when we were
taking care of the president,


1446
01:19:03.262 --> 01:19:05.280
was not that bloody, actually.

1447
01:19:05.364 --> 01:19:07.382
- No.
- He had already bled out


1448
01:19:07.466 --> 01:19:10.953
significantly at the time of the injury.

1449
01:19:11.037 --> 01:19:12.287
Well, he wasn't there, so he...

1450
01:19:12.371 --> 01:19:13.622
- He wasn't there.
- Not--you know,


1451
01:19:13.706 --> 01:19:16.458
he's not capable of rendering an opinion.

1452
01:19:16.542 --> 01:19:20.896
He's just going
by autopsy x-ray, most likely.


1453
01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:23.232
That's a whole different perspective.

1454
01:19:23.316 --> 01:19:26.701
And those x-rays that I've seen are wrong.

1455
01:19:26.785 --> 01:19:31.106
I was both on the right side
and on the left side


1456
01:19:31.190 --> 01:19:33.042
in the course of the treatment.

1457
01:19:33.126 --> 01:19:36.378
And I didn't see any facial damage

1458
01:19:36.462 --> 01:19:38.613
or any area in the forehead--

1459
01:19:38.697 --> 01:19:40.882
any damage in the forehead area.

1460
01:19:40.966 --> 01:19:42.351
It just--it wasn't there.

1461
01:19:42.435 --> 01:19:44.286
No, that's why it's inconsistent

1462
01:19:44.370 --> 01:19:46.255
with the pictures--
the x-ray pictures,


1463
01:19:46.339 --> 01:19:48.523
which show orbital destruction

1464
01:19:48.607 --> 01:19:51.260
that would show things externally.

1465
01:19:56.349 --> 01:19:59.734
But obviously, this has been tampered with

1466
01:19:59.818 --> 01:20:02.237
because they've replaced the scalp

1467
01:20:02.321 --> 01:20:04.790
that was wide-open when I saw the wound.

1468
01:20:07.626 --> 01:20:10.412
I mean, they've done that at the autopsy.

1469
01:20:10.496 --> 01:20:12.948
That's--that's the work in Washington.

1470
01:20:13.032 --> 01:20:15.284
I had seen this massive hole

1471
01:20:15.368 --> 01:20:16.952
in the back of the president's head.

1472
01:20:17.036 --> 01:20:20.522
But then in one
of the pictures, as I recall,


1473
01:20:20.606 --> 01:20:24.459
it looked to me like they were
pulling a flap of scalp


1474
01:20:24.543 --> 01:20:26.895
up over this hole and covering it.

1475
01:20:26.979 --> 01:20:29.464
And in fact, I thought I could
see the finger and the thumb


1476
01:20:29.548 --> 01:20:31.666
of whoever was pulling this flap.

1477
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:35.337
And I thought that it was
pulled up to cover that hole.


1478
01:20:35.421 --> 01:20:38.240
Someone told me,
oh, no, that wasn't a flap.


1479
01:20:38.324 --> 01:20:39.574
That's just the way it looked.

1480
01:20:39.658 --> 01:20:41.110
I said, no, it didn't.

1481
01:20:46.432 --> 01:20:47.782
The government handled the problem

1482
01:20:47.866 --> 01:20:50.885
of the Parkland doctors
badly and dishonorably.


1483
01:20:50.969 --> 01:20:53.422
They should have shown them
those photographs and said,


1484
01:20:53.506 --> 01:20:56.391
is this the way
President Kennedy looked


1485
01:20:56.475 --> 01:20:57.943
in Trauma Room 1?

1486
01:20:59.478 --> 01:21:00.729
The Parkland doctors would have said,

1487
01:21:00.813 --> 01:21:02.597
no, that's not the way
the president looked


1488
01:21:02.681 --> 01:21:04.133
at Parkland Hospital.

1489
01:21:04.217 --> 01:21:06.485
And you can see
that in the Zapruder film.

1490
01:21:08.487 --> 01:21:11.006
I think the Zapruder film
had a lot to do

1491
01:21:11.090 --> 01:21:15.344
with concerns about
how the president was shot.


1492
01:21:15.428 --> 01:21:17.879
President Kennedy was the first person

1493
01:21:17.963 --> 01:21:21.916
to be seen on a video being killed.

1494
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.119
This is one of the most important films

1495
01:21:24.203 --> 01:21:26.155
that exists in history.

1496
01:21:26.239 --> 01:21:28.823
And nevertheless,
the American people didn't know


1497
01:21:28.907 --> 01:21:32.194
about the Zapruder film
until Robert Groden


1498
01:21:32.278 --> 01:21:35.164
and Dick Gregory went
on the "Geraldo" show.


1499
01:21:35.248 --> 01:21:37.132
Eh, was it 1975?

1500
01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:44.506
This is very heavy.
It's the film shot


1501
01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:48.577
by the Dallas dress
manufacturer Abraham Zapruder,


1502
01:21:48.661 --> 01:21:52.114
and it's the execution
of President Kennedy.


1503
01:21:52.198 --> 01:21:54.015
And, you know, before
he goes behind the sign,


1504
01:21:54.099 --> 01:21:56.151
the president is waving to the crowd.

1505
01:21:56.235 --> 01:21:58.353
When he comes out from behind
the sign, he is shot.


1506
01:21:58.437 --> 01:21:59.821
And then
Governor Connally is shot.


1507
01:21:59.905 --> 01:22:02.824
He's already been hit.
He's already been hit.


1508
01:22:02.908 --> 01:22:06.561
And now, at the bottom
of the screen, the head shot.


1509
01:22:06.645 --> 01:22:08.497
That's the shot that blew off his head.

1510
01:22:08.581 --> 01:22:11.450
It's the most horrifying thing
I've ever seen in a movie.


1511
01:22:13.586 --> 01:22:15.804
The Zapruder film is an 8-millimeter film

1512
01:22:15.888 --> 01:22:18.373
that was taken by Abraham Zapruder,

1513
01:22:18.457 --> 01:22:20.142
who was in Dealey Plaza that day,

1514
01:22:20.226 --> 01:22:22.244
and he was standing on the grassy knoll

1515
01:22:22.328 --> 01:22:25.114
on a concrete platform
so he had a better view.


1516
01:22:25.198 --> 01:22:28.550
As the president was coming
down from Houston Street


1517
01:22:28.634 --> 01:22:32.587
and making his turn, it was
about halfway down there,


1518
01:22:32.671 --> 01:22:34.189
I heard a shot.

1519
01:22:34.273 --> 01:22:38.427
Then he just slumped
to the side like this.


1520
01:22:38.511 --> 01:22:39.861
Then I heard another shot or two.

1521
01:22:39.945 --> 01:22:41.796
I couldn't say whether
it was one or two.

1522
01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.199
And I saw his head practically open up,

1523
01:22:44.283 --> 01:22:46.135
all blood and everything.

1524
01:22:46.219 --> 01:22:48.069
And I kept on shooting.

1525
01:22:48.153 --> 01:22:49.904
When you see the Zapruder film,

1526
01:22:49.988 --> 01:22:53.041
you see the motorcade coming
off of Houston Street


1527
01:22:53.125 --> 01:22:57.045
and making a slow turn onto Elm Street,

1528
01:22:57.129 --> 01:23:00.282
heading toward the triple underpass.

1529
01:23:00.366 --> 01:23:03.452
And they look perfectly okay
until they make


1530
01:23:03.536 --> 01:23:05.454
that slow turn, and all of a sudden,

1531
01:23:05.538 --> 01:23:08.557
both of the president's hands
go up to his neck like that,


1532
01:23:08.641 --> 01:23:11.260
like something has happened.

1533
01:23:11.344 --> 01:23:13.328
This bullet hole in his neck,

1534
01:23:13.412 --> 01:23:16.498
we thought--in fact,
Dr. Perry said to the newsmen


1535
01:23:16.582 --> 01:23:19.268
right after we got
out of Trauma Room 1

1536
01:23:19.352 --> 01:23:22.036
that maybe we thought
this was an entrance wound


1537
01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.639
here in his neck, near his windpipe,

1538
01:23:24.723 --> 01:23:26.841
just above his clavicle.

1539
01:23:26.925 --> 01:23:29.378
And Mrs. Kennedy has realized
something is wrong,


1540
01:23:29.462 --> 01:23:33.515
and she's leaning over to him
as if to ask, what's wrong?


1541
01:23:33.599 --> 01:23:35.317
And just as she does that,

1542
01:23:35.401 --> 01:23:39.488
the president's head
literally explodes violently,


1543
01:23:39.572 --> 01:23:42.457
and he's thrown backward and to the left.

1544
01:23:42.541 --> 01:23:45.160
And that's when I
think a missile hit him

1545
01:23:45.244 --> 01:23:47.028
from the picket fence.

1546
01:23:47.112 --> 01:23:50.865
The fatal wound came
from the front, I think,


1547
01:23:50.949 --> 01:23:52.934
and other people believe that too.

1548
01:23:53.018 --> 01:23:55.904
Powers and Kenny O'Donnell,

1549
01:23:55.988 --> 01:23:59.007
who were riding in
one of the cars behind,

1550
01:23:59.091 --> 01:24:02.544
they were convinced that
that fatal shot came


1551
01:24:02.628 --> 01:24:05.598
from the grassy knoll
and the picket fence.


1552
01:24:07.165 --> 01:24:10.151
Self-proclaimed eyewitnesses all claim

1553
01:24:10.235 --> 01:24:12.254
seeing a second gunman

1554
01:24:12.338 --> 01:24:14.723
shooting from behind the picket fence.

1555
01:24:14.807 --> 01:24:16.725
The shot that killed
President Kennedy didn't come


1556
01:24:16.809 --> 01:24:17.892
from the Book Depository.

1557
01:24:17.976 --> 01:24:19.728
They were talking about the fact

1558
01:24:19.812 --> 01:24:21.830
that Mr. Oswald was up
in that School Book.


1559
01:24:21.914 --> 01:24:23.998
And I kept saying,
no, he was not there.

1560
01:24:24.082 --> 01:24:25.099
I saw this.

1561
01:24:25.183 --> 01:24:26.268
I was standing here.

1562
01:24:26.352 --> 01:24:28.503
I saw this.
I saw the whole thing.


1563
01:24:28.587 --> 01:24:30.672
I looked up.
Right there in the bushes,


1564
01:24:30.756 --> 01:24:33.208
this man was shooting with a rifle.

1565
01:24:33.292 --> 01:24:35.677
And I saw a puff of smoke
and a flash of light


1566
01:24:35.761 --> 01:24:38.680
at the very instant
that Kennedy's head exploded.


1567
01:24:38.764 --> 01:24:40.215
This is the view of Elm Street

1568
01:24:40.299 --> 01:24:42.551
from the grassy knoll,
up behind the picket fence


1569
01:24:42.635 --> 01:24:46.288
where some critics claim
another gunman lay concealed.


1570
01:24:46.372 --> 01:24:47.856
Came from that picket fence.

1571
01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:50.825
I glanced over to underneath
that green tree,


1572
01:24:50.909 --> 01:24:52.827
and you could see
a little puff of smoke.

1573
01:24:52.911 --> 01:24:55.697
It looked like a puff of steam
or cigarette smoke.


1574
01:24:55.781 --> 01:24:57.432
The Zapruder film does not show

1575
01:24:57.516 --> 01:24:59.834
the back of the president's
head getting blown out.


1576
01:24:59.918 --> 01:25:03.037
We see the shot to the right temple,

1577
01:25:03.121 --> 01:25:05.206
and we know from the witnesses

1578
01:25:05.290 --> 01:25:07.092
that there was a
blast out of the head.

1579
01:25:08.861 --> 01:25:12.113
The Parkland doctors are
telling us the truth,


1580
01:25:12.197 --> 01:25:14.949
truth beyond any and all doubt.

1581
01:25:15.033 --> 01:25:17.819
The issue, in retrospect,

1582
01:25:17.903 --> 01:25:21.122
was, if Oswald was
in the sixth floor Depository,


1583
01:25:21.206 --> 01:25:23.625
how could he have been shot
from the front, then?


1584
01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:27.629
And so was there more than one assailant?

1585
01:25:27.713 --> 01:25:30.632
Arlen Specter came to Parkland,

1586
01:25:30.716 --> 01:25:34.002
and he said, we have people
who will testify


1587
01:25:34.086 --> 01:25:36.237
that they saw the president shot

1588
01:25:36.321 --> 01:25:39.508
from the front from the railroad track.

1589
01:25:39.592 --> 01:25:43.345
But he said, we don't believe
they have credible testimony.


1590
01:25:43.429 --> 01:25:46.247
But I don't want you to say
anything else about that.


1591
01:25:46.331 --> 01:25:48.817
The Zapruder film, when he's hit,

1592
01:25:48.901 --> 01:25:52.153
you see this whole flash
of bone, you know, coming out.


1593
01:25:52.237 --> 01:25:54.856
And that was compatible with what I saw

1594
01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:57.726
from his right side, where I was located.

1595
01:25:57.810 --> 01:26:02.230
How could a gunshot from the rear

1596
01:26:02.314 --> 01:26:05.700
peel the scalp from the front back?

1597
01:26:05.784 --> 01:26:09.070
And my opinion is that
this was a flap from the--


1598
01:26:09.154 --> 01:26:11.906
the whole right side bunched up
into the back of the--


1599
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:14.343
- It was, yeah.
- At the base of the occiput.


1600
01:26:14.427 --> 01:26:16.010
Yeah.
And you see that,


1601
01:26:16.094 --> 01:26:19.047
and I think that kind of fell
back into place a little bit.


1602
01:26:19.131 --> 01:26:21.149
But then the missile went on through

1603
01:26:21.233 --> 01:26:24.052
and blew out the back of his head.

1604
01:26:24.136 --> 01:26:25.854
Yeah.
It was temporal also.


1605
01:26:25.938 --> 01:26:28.022
And you can see
that in the Zapruder film.

1606
01:26:28.106 --> 01:26:30.224
- But I saw that on him.
- Yeah.


1607
01:26:30.308 --> 01:26:31.376
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.


1608
01:26:34.346 --> 01:26:37.866
I think it's honorable
that the Parkland physicians


1609
01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:42.404
and nurses have maintained
their original positions


1610
01:26:42.488 --> 01:26:47.842
and have not deviated from
what they observed in 1963,


1611
01:26:47.926 --> 01:26:49.478
60 years ago.

1612
01:26:49.562 --> 01:26:56.385
The evidence shows that
the murder of the president


1613
01:26:56.469 --> 01:27:00.555
was a straightforward shooting, period.

1614
01:27:00.639 --> 01:27:01.956
What's more likely,

1615
01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:03.925
Parkland doctors telling the truth

1616
01:27:04.009 --> 01:27:05.894
or the autopsy telling the truth?

1617
01:27:05.978 --> 01:27:09.230
In all probability,
there was a conspiracy,


1618
01:27:09.314 --> 01:27:12.033
i.e., there was more than one shooter.

1619
01:27:12.117 --> 01:27:15.904
And I think that shooter was
behind the picket fence


1620
01:27:15.988 --> 01:27:18.840
on the grassy knoll, and then someone was

1621
01:27:18.924 --> 01:27:22.160
in the sixth floor of the Book Depository.

1622
01:27:24.897 --> 01:27:27.582
That first day, in the first 24 hours,

1623
01:27:27.666 --> 01:27:31.185
we, I think, all thought that
that was an entrance wound.


1624
01:27:31.269 --> 01:27:35.890
I've always entertained
a strong possibility


1625
01:27:35.974 --> 01:27:40.629
of there being more than one shooter.

1626
01:27:40.713 --> 01:27:42.363
It was a lie.

1627
01:27:42.447 --> 01:27:45.984
They really didn't
tell the truth about it.


1628
01:27:55.694 --> 01:28:00.281
I didn't ever think he would
be in Parkland on the gurney


1629
01:28:00.365 --> 01:28:02.150
and we would be taking care of him

1630
01:28:02.234 --> 01:28:05.370
and watch him take his last breath.

1631
01:28:08.974 --> 01:28:10.792
Probably one of the most dramatic moments

1632
01:28:10.876 --> 01:28:14.062
in U.S. history and a pivotal moment

1633
01:28:14.146 --> 01:28:16.381
for me and my whole life.

1634
01:28:18.450 --> 01:28:20.635
I've had a very interesting life.

1635
01:28:20.719 --> 01:28:23.104
I've had a lot of intersections

1636
01:28:23.188 --> 01:28:25.173
with events and people,

1637
01:28:25.257 --> 01:28:28.543
but none as dramatic and as strong

1638
01:28:28.627 --> 01:28:30.829
as the events of that day.

1639
01:28:32.197 --> 01:28:34.900
Sometimes the sadness comes out.

1640
01:28:36.434 --> 01:28:38.687
The thought of the assassination

1641
01:28:38.771 --> 01:28:41.590
and my participation in it,
as well as others,


1642
01:28:41.674 --> 01:28:43.391
never goes away.

1643
01:28:43.475 --> 01:28:47.496
You replay that day in your mind.

1644
01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:50.131
It certainly is the most significant event

1645
01:28:50.215 --> 01:28:53.085
that ever occurred in my life.

1646
01:28:54.452 --> 01:28:58.707
I take my being there very seriously.

1647
01:28:58.791 --> 01:29:01.910
And I don't really enjoy

1648
01:29:01.994 --> 01:29:04.946
telling the story of what happened.

1649
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:08.116
But it was a very important time,

1650
01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:11.804
and it was my destiny to be there.

1651
01:29:14.439 --> 01:29:16.525
In America,
I think it was one of the most


1652
01:29:16.609 --> 01:29:20.562
significant events of the century,

1653
01:29:20.646 --> 01:29:23.698
but also a loss of innocence.
