1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.098
She's crazy.

2
00:00:02.122 --> 00:00:03.578
Please hurry!

3
00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:04.840
They're on their way.

4
00:00:04.864 --> 00:00:05.971
Why is she doing this?

5
00:00:05.995 --> 00:00:07.799
I don't know.

6
00:00:07.823 --> 00:00:09.323
We've called the police.

7
00:00:09.347 --> 00:00:10.783
Let me in!

8
00:00:42.336 --> 00:00:44.358
I thought I heard
you up last night.


9
00:00:44.382 --> 00:00:46.447
Yeah, I had a nightmare.

10
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:48.753
What was it about?

11
00:00:48.777 --> 00:00:50.126
I don't remember.

12
00:00:53.042 --> 00:00:54.193
Am I taking you
to school or not?


13
00:00:54.217 --> 00:00:56.239
Not.

14
00:00:56.263 --> 00:00:59.285
Fine. I'll pick you up at 3:30

15
00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.678
and drop you off
at Dr. Fischer's office


16
00:01:00.702 --> 00:01:04.247
like a good Uber driver.

17
00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:07.337
Can't wait.

18
00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:10.209
Lisa, look at me.

19
00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:11.907
This isn't my fault.

20
00:01:13.628 --> 00:01:15.780
Spoken like a true lawyer.

21
00:01:15.804 --> 00:01:17.478
What's that supposed to mean?

22
00:01:17.502 --> 00:01:19.634
That there's
no arguing with you.


23
00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:26.155
My God, Lisa,
where have you been?


24
00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.505
I texted you
like 20 times this week.


25
00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:31.116
Sorry, Penny, I just
haven't been in the mood.


26
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.336
To talk to your best friend,
really?


27
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.164
I said I'm sorry.
My parents just split up.


28
00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:36.992
Can I get a break?

29
00:02:37.016 --> 00:02:38.602
That's like half the kids
in this school.


30
00:02:38.626 --> 00:02:40.691
It's no reason to drop
your friends over it.


31
00:02:40.715 --> 00:02:43.999
I just have a lot on my plate
right now, okay?


32
00:02:44.023 --> 00:02:47.417
You know what, Lisa?
I hope you clear it.


33
00:03:03.956 --> 00:03:06.630
So, Mr. Clark,
how can I help you today?


34
00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:08.893
So what exactly does
a tax attorney do anyway?


35
00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:11.635
Well, in your case,
I provide legal counsel


36
00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.725
for the structure and
tax treatment of your business.


37
00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:15.857
What kind of company
are you starting?


38
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:17.249
Security.

39
00:03:17.273 --> 00:03:20.252
Turned in my shield
after 20 years.


40
00:03:20.276 --> 00:03:23.778
I wanna live a little bit
larger than my pension allows.


41
00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:26.998
It's dangerous work.
They should pay you fellas more.


42
00:03:27.022 --> 00:03:29.348
Hey, you're the preacher,
I'm the choir, Miss Sullivan.


43
00:03:29.372 --> 00:03:31.699
It's Missus.

44
00:03:31.723 --> 00:03:34.353
Sorry. I didn't see
a wedding ring.


45
00:03:34.377 --> 00:03:35.988
I just assumed.

46
00:03:37.424 --> 00:03:39.469
Let's get started, shall we?

47
00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.549
Hey, Nate.

48
00:03:55.573 --> 00:03:57.551
Hey, Tim, what's up?
You moved in yet?


49
00:03:57.575 --> 00:04:00.641
Staring at my immediate fate
as we speak.


50
00:04:00.665 --> 00:04:03.992
Me too. I never thought
I'd own my own restaurant.


51
00:04:04.016 --> 00:04:05.994
Well, I never thought
I'd be the head chef of one.


52
00:04:06.018 --> 00:04:08.039
Well, I did,
ever since you catered


53
00:04:08.063 --> 00:04:09.998
my parents' big anniversary
party when I was 10.


54
00:04:10.022 --> 00:04:12.217
I appreciate you taking
this chance on me, Nate, really,


55
00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:14.524
even if it blew up my life.

56
00:04:14.548 --> 00:04:18.397
Yeah, look, I'm sorry about
you and Heather separating.


57
00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:21.009
Well, you offered me my dream,
and I accepted it.


58
00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:22.967
I just hope
I don't let you down.


59
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:25.796
Have you tried your food?

60
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.972
Just relax tonight.

61
00:04:27.996 --> 00:04:29.321
While you're relaxing,
you mind coming up with


62
00:04:29.345 --> 00:04:31.367
a new dessert or two?

63
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:33.238
Yeah, I'm gonna
can the Zabaglione.


64
00:04:33.262 --> 00:04:34.457
No one knows
what the hell it is.


65
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:36.024
Hell, I don't think I do.

66
00:04:36.048 --> 00:04:37.895
Okay, all right,
I'll see you in the morning.


67
00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.593
All right.

68
00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:07.446
All right.

69
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.342
I'll get some lunch.

70
00:05:15.609 --> 00:05:18.762
Okay, hold on, hold on.
I know it's in here.


71
00:05:18.786 --> 00:05:20.895
Just give me a minutes.

72
00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.200
Yeah, you said that
two minutes ago.


73
00:05:22.224 --> 00:05:24.289
Come on!

74
00:05:24.313 --> 00:05:26.030
Yeah, we haven't got all day!

75
00:05:28.274 --> 00:05:30.208
Okay, it was on the kitchen
counter this morning,


76
00:05:30.232 --> 00:05:31.296
and then I put it in my bag.

77
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.429
It's just... Damn it!

78
00:05:33.453 --> 00:05:35.213
Everything okay?

79
00:05:35.237 --> 00:05:36.911
Yeah. I'm just having
the worst day of my life.


80
00:05:36.935 --> 00:05:38.477
How are you?

81
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:40.218
If leaving your wallet at home

82
00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:41.524
is the worst thing
that's ever happened to you,


83
00:05:41.548 --> 00:05:44.179
you've had a pretty
damn good life.


84
00:05:44.203 --> 00:05:46.268
How obnoxious
do I sound right now?


85
00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:48.139
When you guys get a chance,
can you let me know


86
00:05:48.163 --> 00:05:49.750
if this is gonna be
lunch or dinner?


87
00:05:49.774 --> 00:05:51.055
All right, how much?

88
00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:52.927
10.65.
No, no, no, I can't...


89
00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:55.059
No, please.
Help out a pretty woman


90
00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:56.974
and teach a lesson in manners
at the same time?


91
00:05:56.998 --> 00:05:58.497
Whatever, man, it's your money.

92
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:00.219
And your attitude.

93
00:06:03.483 --> 00:06:05.591
Um, thanks.
Sure.


94
00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.095
Jamie.
Tim.


95
00:06:09.228 --> 00:06:10.229
Next.

96
00:06:11.317 --> 00:06:12.468
Finally.

97
00:06:12.492 --> 00:06:13.948
Ladies, what can I get you?

98
00:06:13.972 --> 00:06:17.299
Thank you.
You saved my life back there.


99
00:06:17.323 --> 00:06:19.127
You don't have to
walk me to my car.


100
00:06:19.151 --> 00:06:20.694
I don't mind.

101
00:06:20.718 --> 00:06:22.478
Your wife's a lucky lady.

102
00:06:22.502 --> 00:06:25.873
It's, uh, it's complicated.

103
00:06:25.897 --> 00:06:28.005
Hmm. Do you have kids?

104
00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:31.443
Daughter Lisa, she's 16.

105
00:06:31.467 --> 00:06:33.707
How's she handling
the complication?


106
00:06:33.731 --> 00:06:35.709
It's been hard.

107
00:06:35.733 --> 00:06:38.799
She feels like she had the rug
pulled out from underneath her,


108
00:06:38.823 --> 00:06:41.410
but she knows
I would never hurt her.


109
00:06:41.434 --> 00:06:44.326
So what do knights in
shining armor do nowadays?


110
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.198
Oh, uh, you know, whole lot
of riding white stallions.


111
00:06:47.222 --> 00:06:50.854
Generally, a lot of jousting
is involved.


112
00:06:50.878 --> 00:06:52.290
Actually, I'm the head chef
at a new restaurant


113
00:06:52.314 --> 00:06:53.814
opening up on Lake Drive.

114
00:06:53.838 --> 00:06:56.294
So you cook too.
Yep.


115
00:06:56.318 --> 00:06:58.427
You're just like
some sort of unicorn.


116
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.430
Yeah. What do you do?

117
00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:04.389
Nothing right now.
I just moved into town.


118
00:07:04.413 --> 00:07:07.828
I'm living in the Deer Hill
Apartments down the road.


119
00:07:07.852 --> 00:07:09.220
Are you kidding?
Mm-mm.


120
00:07:09.244 --> 00:07:10.787
I just signed a lease
there today.


121
00:07:10.811 --> 00:07:13.007
Wow. Building two.

122
00:07:13.031 --> 00:07:13.988
Three.

123
00:07:15.207 --> 00:07:17.272
That's crazy.

124
00:07:17.296 --> 00:07:19.840
Well, I guess it was fate
that we met, huh?


125
00:07:19.864 --> 00:07:21.406
Yeah.

126
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.191
Oh, let me get it.

127
00:07:23.215 --> 00:07:25.434
Watch out, hero.
I got this one.


128
00:07:29.221 --> 00:07:33.375
Oh, don't get shy
on me now, Tim.


129
00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:36.030
Yeah, I guess I should go, huh?

130
00:07:36.054 --> 00:07:37.858
Okay.

131
00:07:37.882 --> 00:07:40.817
Okay, see ya.

132
00:07:40.841 --> 00:07:43.844
I'll see you around, neighbor.
Okay, yeah.


133
00:08:38.856 --> 00:08:41.399
Better hurry. Jaworski's
gonna chew you ass off.


134
00:08:41.423 --> 00:08:43.488
I know.

135
00:08:50.955 --> 00:08:52.976
What are you doing in here?

136
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.935
I've been looking for you
all day.


137
00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:56.221
Hey.

138
00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:01.985
What, are you mad at me?

139
00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:05.684
I just need some space.

140
00:09:05.708 --> 00:09:08.949
Look, Lisa, I know you're
having a really hard time


141
00:09:08.973 --> 00:09:10.646
with your parents' breakup,

142
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.474
but I can't help you
work through any of it


143
00:09:12.498 --> 00:09:14.084
if you won't talk about it.

144
00:09:14.108 --> 00:09:15.259
I can't help how I feel.

145
00:09:15.283 --> 00:09:16.957
You think that I can't?

146
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:18.915
Steven, let go.

147
00:09:18.939 --> 00:09:20.612
Look, Lisa,
I'm just trying to help.


148
00:09:20.636 --> 00:09:21.875
Well, now is not the time.

149
00:09:21.899 --> 00:09:23.050
Ow.

150
00:09:23.074 --> 00:09:24.616
I'm sorry, I...

151
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.881
Sullivan, get out here now!

152
00:09:27.905 --> 00:09:31.101
You better get out of here
before Jaws catches you.


153
00:09:31.125 --> 00:09:33.103
Okay. Can we talk
about this later?


154
00:09:33.127 --> 00:09:35.303
Maybe, but right now
you just have to go.


155
00:09:57.151 --> 00:09:59.086
Sullivan!

156
00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.089
Where do you think you're going?

157
00:10:02.113 --> 00:10:04.874
You've been swimming here
for me for four years,


158
00:10:04.898 --> 00:10:07.442
and you still don't know
there's no running at the pool?


159
00:10:07.466 --> 00:10:09.052
Sorry, Coach.

160
00:10:09.076 --> 00:10:11.663
I know you're going
through a lot at home,


161
00:10:11.687 --> 00:10:13.665
but it's not a good reason
to slack off over here.


162
00:10:13.689 --> 00:10:15.537
And you're late.

163
00:10:15.561 --> 00:10:18.409
Why do you ride on me so hard?
Because you're good!


164
00:10:18.433 --> 00:10:20.281
'Cause you're the best
I've ever seen.


165
00:10:20.305 --> 00:10:22.196
You're better than them.

166
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.200
You start going half ass,
everybody's looking at you.


167
00:10:26.224 --> 00:10:29.638
Your times have been
really slow this month,


168
00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:33.642
so what are you
gonna do about it?


169
00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:35.557
Uh, swim faster?

170
00:10:37.235 --> 00:10:39.213
That'd be a good idea.

171
00:10:39.237 --> 00:10:44.044
And, Sullivan, at the end,
I want 20 extra laps.


172
00:10:44.068 --> 00:10:45.741
I'm gonna be late for class.
I can't...


173
00:10:45.765 --> 00:10:48.657
No! 20! That's it!

174
00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:50.378
Okay, 20.

175
00:11:15.055 --> 00:11:17.903
You've given me the silent
treatment this entire ride here.


176
00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:20.123
You're taking me to a therapist.

177
00:11:20.147 --> 00:11:22.343
How much talking
do you want one girl to do?


178
00:11:22.367 --> 00:11:24.693
As much as you want.

179
00:11:24.717 --> 00:11:27.609
Let's not pretend what I want
is up for discussion, Mom.


180
00:11:27.633 --> 00:11:30.394
Look, I am not the one
who wanted change.


181
00:11:30.418 --> 00:11:31.917
You can blame your dad for that.

182
00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:35.225
Blame. Another lawyer word?

183
00:11:35.249 --> 00:11:37.880
That's right, Lisa,
I'm a lawyer.


184
00:11:37.904 --> 00:11:39.969
And I worked really hard
to become one.


185
00:11:39.993 --> 00:11:43.059
And I work harder every day
to pay for our house,


186
00:11:43.083 --> 00:11:44.800
this car, your clothes.

187
00:11:44.824 --> 00:11:46.802
I thought change was supposed
to be a good thing.


188
00:11:46.826 --> 00:11:49.109
Yeah, it's been a blast so far.

189
00:11:49.133 --> 00:11:50.980
Hey, I'm the one who has
to pack a bag every weekend.


190
00:11:51.004 --> 00:11:52.460
It's not like
I'm in high school,


191
00:11:52.484 --> 00:11:55.028
trying to figure out
my life or anything!


192
00:11:55.052 --> 00:11:56.855
Lisa...

193
00:11:56.879 --> 00:12:00.859
Fine. Just go.
You know what? Go ahead.


194
00:12:00.883 --> 00:12:05.255
Your dad will pick you up
when you're done.


195
00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:07.214
You know, you can hate me
if you want,


196
00:12:07.238 --> 00:12:09.216
but I am not the bad guy here.

197
00:12:11.242 --> 00:12:13.070
At least he still
wears his ring.


198
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.291
I'll see you Sunday.

199
00:12:41.707 --> 00:12:44.207
Hi, Lisa.

200
00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:46.103
Are you ready?

201
00:12:49.715 --> 00:12:52.563
You seem reticent.

202
00:12:52.587 --> 00:12:55.653
Sorry. I must've missed that one
in my SAT prep.


203
00:12:55.677 --> 00:12:58.526
Clammed up, shy.

204
00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:01.833
Well, what would you like me
to articulate?


205
00:13:01.857 --> 00:13:03.792
See, you're not the only one
that uses big words.


206
00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:07.187
You can say
anything you want here.


207
00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:09.014
No offense, Doc.

208
00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:11.930
I don't really feel like
talking to anyone right now.


209
00:13:11.954 --> 00:13:14.237
Does that include your friends?

210
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:17.980
My life is way too mortifying
to share with them.


211
00:13:18.004 --> 00:13:21.853
Let's make it simple then.
Let's talk about things.


212
00:13:21.877 --> 00:13:23.899
Finish this sentence.

213
00:13:23.923 --> 00:13:27.381
Things at school are...

214
00:13:27.405 --> 00:13:28.773
Repetitive.

215
00:13:28.797 --> 00:13:32.647
Things with the swim team are...

216
00:13:32.671 --> 00:13:34.388
Fine, I guess.

217
00:13:34.412 --> 00:13:35.954
It's a lot of pressure.

218
00:13:35.978 --> 00:13:37.478
You have a boyfriend?

219
00:13:37.502 --> 00:13:39.741
Yeah, Steven.

220
00:13:39.765 --> 00:13:41.201
Things with Steven are...

221
00:13:43.725 --> 00:13:45.399
Challenging.

222
00:13:45.423 --> 00:13:47.009
Do you want to talk about that?

223
00:13:47.033 --> 00:13:48.315
No.

224
00:13:48.339 --> 00:13:50.534
All right.

225
00:13:50.558 --> 00:13:53.798
Things with your parents?

226
00:13:53.822 --> 00:13:55.322
I don't know. You tell me.
They come here twice a week.


227
00:13:55.346 --> 00:13:56.975
What do they say?

228
00:13:56.999 --> 00:13:58.673
That they love you,

229
00:13:58.697 --> 00:14:01.197
that they're going
through a hard time.


230
00:14:01.221 --> 00:14:05.201
That's pretty much
all I can divulge.


231
00:14:05.225 --> 00:14:08.683
Are you still angry with her?

232
00:14:08.707 --> 00:14:10.946
Well, do they ask
what I talk about?


233
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.339
They get the same answer.

234
00:14:12.363 --> 00:14:14.471
Well, then hell yeah, I'm angry.

235
00:14:14.495 --> 00:14:17.561
My Mom talks about
how it's unfair.


236
00:14:17.585 --> 00:14:19.041
Well, you know what's unfair?

237
00:14:19.065 --> 00:14:20.738
My Dad giving up
his entire career,


238
00:14:20.762 --> 00:14:24.960
his special thing,
to be Mr. Mom,


239
00:14:24.984 --> 00:14:27.136
so she can be, what,
some hotshot lawyer?


240
00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.574
Well, I'd say your dad's
special thing is being your dad.


241
00:14:30.598 --> 00:14:33.490
Have you ever tried
his chicken saltimbocca?


242
00:14:33.514 --> 00:14:36.232
I have not.

243
00:14:36.256 --> 00:14:38.452
Yeah, because only me
and my mom have.


244
00:14:38.476 --> 00:14:41.281
And after 16 years
of being on the sidelines,


245
00:14:41.305 --> 00:14:44.414
it's time for him to show
everyone how great he is.


246
00:14:44.438 --> 00:14:46.764
I see that's important to you.

247
00:14:46.788 --> 00:14:48.462
Of course it's important to me.

248
00:14:48.486 --> 00:14:51.228
He's taken care of me
my entire life.


249
00:14:54.274 --> 00:14:56.252
Well, what about your mother's
special thing?


250
00:14:56.276 --> 00:14:59.560
Which one, work or spin class?

251
00:14:59.584 --> 00:15:02.127
That's a pretty cold response.

252
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:05.024
Well, she's a pretty cold woman.

253
00:15:06.634 --> 00:15:09.831
Look, I'll tell you, Doc,

254
00:15:09.855 --> 00:15:11.770
I'm on Team Dad all the way.

255
00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:21.083
Hey, Dad.
Hey, kiddo.


256
00:15:25.305 --> 00:15:27.327
So what going on
with the official opening?


257
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:30.112
Uh, we had to push it a week.
Why? Is everything okay?


258
00:15:30.136 --> 00:15:31.809
Me parent, you kid.

259
00:15:31.833 --> 00:15:33.811
I should be asking
those questions.


260
00:15:33.835 --> 00:15:35.378
I've been answering them
all day.


261
00:15:35.402 --> 00:15:37.926
How was therapy?
Is it helping?


262
00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:42.603
Yeah, it helps, I think.

263
00:15:42.627 --> 00:15:44.431
Okay, your turn.

264
00:15:44.455 --> 00:15:46.389
It's just
a liquor license thing,


265
00:15:46.413 --> 00:15:48.783
although I do expect the
investors to run for the hills


266
00:15:48.807 --> 00:15:51.089
once they find out
a rookie is running the kitchen.


267
00:15:51.113 --> 00:15:52.613
Please, they're gonna
be running for the banks


268
00:15:52.637 --> 00:15:54.571
with all this town's money.

269
00:15:54.595 --> 00:15:56.007
We'll see.

270
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:19.640
Ready for the grand tour?

271
00:16:19.664 --> 00:16:21.013
Let's go.

272
00:16:24.669 --> 00:16:28.344
Ah, the palace.

273
00:16:28.368 --> 00:16:29.954
There's my place right there.
Or our place.


274
00:16:29.978 --> 00:16:32.783
Okay.
And I got a pool.


275
00:16:32.807 --> 00:16:35.395
And we have a Jacuzzi,

276
00:16:35.419 --> 00:16:37.290
and there's a gym up front.

277
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.704
It's good stuff.

278
00:16:40.728 --> 00:16:42.121
Come on.

279
00:16:59.747 --> 00:17:02.726
Hey. So?

280
00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.467
How do you like the place?

281
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:06.426
I like it.
Yeah, it's great.


282
00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.124
Good. I just figured if we're
gonna be here for a while,


283
00:17:09.148 --> 00:17:11.716
you know, I mean,
if we're gonna do this, right?


284
00:17:13.848 --> 00:17:15.197
So, um...

285
00:17:19.376 --> 00:17:20.918
Look, kiddo, I just...

286
00:17:20.942 --> 00:17:23.138
I just want you to know
that I'm aware


287
00:17:23.162 --> 00:17:26.707
of the sacrifices that you're
making to spend time with me.


288
00:17:26.731 --> 00:17:29.492
I mean, you're a teenager
for Christ's sake.


289
00:17:29.516 --> 00:17:31.015
You should be out there
with your friends


290
00:17:31.039 --> 00:17:32.190
on the weekends, right?

291
00:17:32.214 --> 00:17:33.931
Don't sweat it, Dad.

292
00:17:33.955 --> 00:17:36.107
I'm in hermit mode right now.

293
00:17:36.131 --> 00:17:38.980
Yeah, that doesn't mean
you should be stuck


294
00:17:39.004 --> 00:17:41.112
in the middle of some
second-act twist


295
00:17:41.136 --> 00:17:42.810
of your parent's marriage.

296
00:17:42.834 --> 00:17:45.203
It's okay.
It's selfish.


297
00:17:45.227 --> 00:17:47.205
I'm selfish.

298
00:17:47.229 --> 00:17:51.427
Because you're living for
someone other than us for once?


299
00:17:51.451 --> 00:17:53.516
I wish Mom could try
to wrap her head around it,


300
00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.996
but, you know,
she's being such a...


301
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.564
Don't, don't put it
on her, okay?


302
00:17:57.588 --> 00:17:59.217
It's not fair.
Don't do that.


303
00:18:02.201 --> 00:18:05.746
Look, they call it a
"trial separation" for a reason.


304
00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:09.184
I'm gonna try it on for size.

305
00:18:09.208 --> 00:18:12.448
I'm sure Dr. Fischer
would put it better.


306
00:18:12.472 --> 00:18:15.146
"There's something wrong
with your marriage, dear."


307
00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.671
"You have to figure it out."

308
00:18:17.695 --> 00:18:21.196
Yes, that's exactly it.

309
00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.851
Okay, I'm gonna get a swim in
before dinner.


310
00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:25.137
Okay.

311
00:18:26.573 --> 00:18:27.811
The place looks
really awesome, Dad.


312
00:18:27.835 --> 00:18:30.055
Thank you. I love you.

313
00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:34.339
Love you too.

314
00:19:04.655 --> 00:19:07.851
Ah, you scared me.

315
00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:10.027
I don't even know
how to doggy style or...


316
00:19:10.051 --> 00:19:11.551
Is that what I mean?

317
00:19:11.575 --> 00:19:12.943
I don't know.

318
00:19:12.967 --> 00:19:15.119
You training for the Olympics?

319
00:19:15.143 --> 00:19:17.818
No. I'm just in high school.

320
00:19:17.842 --> 00:19:20.168
Oh, God, I miss high school.

321
00:19:20.192 --> 00:19:21.541
I'm Jamie.

322
00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:25.565
Lisa.

323
00:19:25.589 --> 00:19:28.524
I've lived here about a month,
and I haven't seen you around.


324
00:19:28.548 --> 00:19:31.135
Yeah, my dad just moved in.

325
00:19:31.159 --> 00:19:33.181
I'm here mostly on the weekends.

326
00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:35.773
Did your parents just split up?

327
00:19:37.949 --> 00:19:39.709
Yeah. Let me guess.

328
00:19:39.733 --> 00:19:42.233
You're doing the dance
of the part-time parents.


329
00:19:42.257 --> 00:19:45.802
In one corner, you got Mom,
the weekday tyrant,


330
00:19:45.826 --> 00:19:47.804
makes you take your vitamins,
do your homework,


331
00:19:47.828 --> 00:19:50.764
and is a basic pain in the ass.

332
00:19:50.788 --> 00:19:53.288
And in the other,
you've got your dad,


333
00:19:53.312 --> 00:19:55.420
who let's you stay up late,
do whatever you want,


334
00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:58.467
but just doesn't know
quite what to say to you.


335
00:19:58.491 --> 00:19:59.599
Am I close?

336
00:20:00.798 --> 00:20:02.950
Something like that, yeah.

337
00:20:02.974 --> 00:20:05.082
Do you have a boyfriend?

338
00:20:05.106 --> 00:20:06.606
Well...

339
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.521
Hmm.

340
00:20:08.545 --> 00:20:10.372
Guys can be jerks sometimes.

341
00:20:13.027 --> 00:20:15.073
Did he do that to your arm?

342
00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.885
It was an accident.

343
00:20:24.909 --> 00:20:26.626
Grabbing your wrist
and squeezing


344
00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:28.149
doesn't sound like an accident.

345
00:20:28.173 --> 00:20:31.631
No, it was me. I did it
when I yanked it away.


346
00:20:31.655 --> 00:20:34.024
If you want my opinion, a guy
shouldn't be grabbing your wrist


347
00:20:34.048 --> 00:20:35.548
in the first place.

348
00:20:35.572 --> 00:20:37.245
Lisa.

349
00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:38.899
Who's this?

350
00:20:38.923 --> 00:20:40.422
She's my friend.

351
00:20:40.446 --> 00:20:42.729
Okay, listen.

352
00:20:42.753 --> 00:20:44.600
I know you haven't been
feeling like talking much.


353
00:20:44.624 --> 00:20:46.471
Then why are you here?

354
00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:48.648
Who are you again?

355
00:20:48.672 --> 00:20:49.910
I'm her new friend.
Who are you?


356
00:20:49.934 --> 00:20:51.999
Her best friend.

357
00:20:52.023 --> 00:20:53.590
Can we talk?

358
00:20:54.678 --> 00:20:56.549
Alone?

359
00:21:06.472 --> 00:21:08.189
Who's that?

360
00:21:08.213 --> 00:21:10.931
Jamie. I just met her.

361
00:21:10.955 --> 00:21:14.978
I'm glad to see you guys are
having a great time together.


362
00:21:15.002 --> 00:21:18.329
Penny, it's not you.
I'm just hiding out for a while.


363
00:21:18.353 --> 00:21:20.201
Is everything okay over here?

364
00:21:20.225 --> 00:21:24.074
Uh, yeah.
Thanks for asking.


365
00:21:24.098 --> 00:21:25.598
Come on. Ashley and Ben
are at the Lakewood Mall.


366
00:21:25.622 --> 00:21:27.600
Let's do a little retail damage.

367
00:21:27.624 --> 00:21:30.124
I shouldn't. It's my first
weekend here. I should stay.


368
00:21:30.148 --> 00:21:31.473
Are you sure?

369
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.564
Okay, you're weird.
And you?


370
00:21:35.588 --> 00:21:38.567
You can call me when you're
ready to get your life back.


371
00:21:38.591 --> 00:21:41.135
Penny, I'm sorry!

372
00:21:41.159 --> 00:21:43.354
Sorry. Did I overstep
my boundary there?


373
00:21:43.378 --> 00:21:45.748
You just seemed
really uncomfortable.


374
00:21:45.772 --> 00:21:49.273
It's fine. I don't wanna be
around people who know me well.


375
00:21:49.297 --> 00:21:50.623
Well, I don't like her.

376
00:21:50.647 --> 00:21:52.102
Lisa!

377
00:21:52.126 --> 00:21:54.975
Is that your dad?
Yeah.


378
00:21:54.999 --> 00:21:57.151
I can see where you
get your good looks.


379
00:21:57.175 --> 00:21:59.022
Hey, Tim!

380
00:21:59.046 --> 00:22:01.459
I'm so sorry.
I'm terrible with names.


381
00:22:01.483 --> 00:22:02.722
It's Jamie.
Jamie.


382
00:22:02.746 --> 00:22:04.506
All together now.
Jamie, okay.


383
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.465
I still owe you 10 bucks.
Forget it. It's okay.


384
00:22:07.489 --> 00:22:09.859
Did you know
that your dad's a hero?


385
00:22:09.883 --> 00:22:11.731
I know.

386
00:22:11.755 --> 00:22:13.950
It was really nothing.
Ready to eat, kiddo?


387
00:22:13.974 --> 00:22:15.691
Yeah, sure.
Nice to meet you.


388
00:22:15.715 --> 00:22:17.127
Yeah, it was really good
meeting you.


389
00:22:17.151 --> 00:22:19.042
I'm sure I'll see you around.
You too.


390
00:22:19.066 --> 00:22:21.721
Yeah, okay, see ya.
Come on.


391
00:23:32.836 --> 00:23:35.012
Mmm.

392
00:23:45.457 --> 00:23:46.763
Mmm.

393
00:25:18.724 --> 00:25:20.571
Thanks for the help, Lisa.

394
00:25:20.595 --> 00:25:22.008
Thanks for making my dad happy.

395
00:25:22.032 --> 00:25:24.097
I'm pretty sure you do that.

396
00:25:24.121 --> 00:25:25.035
Good night.

397
00:26:37.542 --> 00:26:39.824
Ta-da!

398
00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:41.459
Oh, my God.

399
00:26:49.206 --> 00:26:51.358
Oh, my God.
Are you kidding?


400
00:26:51.382 --> 00:26:53.273
What did you put
in the sauce, crack?


401
00:26:53.297 --> 00:26:55.579
Just a little sugar.

402
00:26:55.603 --> 00:26:58.278
Okay, this place
is gonna destroy.


403
00:26:58.302 --> 00:27:00.323
I don't know.

404
00:27:00.347 --> 00:27:02.369
crash and burn
in the first year.


405
00:27:02.393 --> 00:27:05.850
Yeah, because they don't
have the secret formula.


406
00:27:05.874 --> 00:27:07.243
I'm so proud of you, Dad.

407
00:27:07.267 --> 00:27:08.703
I'm proud of you.

408
00:27:21.325 --> 00:27:22.717
Hello, Lisa.

409
00:27:40.257 --> 00:27:41.998
Hi, Tim.

410
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.199
So what do you think
about our cute neighbor?


411
00:27:50.223 --> 00:27:53.115
Cute?
Believe it or not, kiddo,


412
00:27:53.139 --> 00:27:55.552
I could measure a woman's appeal
even before the separation.


413
00:27:57.361 --> 00:28:00.253
Um, yeah, she's funny.

414
00:28:00.277 --> 00:28:02.081
She's the only person I know
from my away home


415
00:28:02.105 --> 00:28:04.866
that's not from home,
besides you.


416
00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:06.215
Well, she is a little older
than you,


417
00:28:06.239 --> 00:28:08.217
but I'm glad you met a friend.

418
00:28:08.241 --> 00:28:09.634
She seems super chill.
Yeah.


419
00:28:33.136 --> 00:28:36.115
Ugh. I am stuffed.

420
00:28:36.139 --> 00:28:38.943
Great. Then my job is done.

421
00:28:38.967 --> 00:28:40.597
How about a movie?
Sure.


422
00:28:40.621 --> 00:28:42.121
Great. What are you thinking?

423
00:28:42.145 --> 00:28:44.210
I don't care,
as long as it's funny.


424
00:28:44.234 --> 00:28:47.019
Funny. We could do funny.
I have funny. Let's do it.


425
00:29:23.664 --> 00:29:25.686
Hey, Mrs. Sullivan,
what's up?


426
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.949
Hi, Penny, sorry to bother you.

427
00:29:27.973 --> 00:29:30.995
I'm looking for Lisa, and
she's not answering her phone.


428
00:29:31.019 --> 00:29:34.129
Well, she's not not answering
any of my calls now either.


429
00:29:34.153 --> 00:29:37.132
I know, I'm sorry. She's really
been pulling away from everyone.


430
00:29:37.156 --> 00:29:39.003
Well, except her father.

431
00:29:39.027 --> 00:29:41.223
And Jamie.
Who?


432
00:29:41.247 --> 00:29:43.182
Some rude neighbor
of Mr. Sullivan's.


433
00:29:43.206 --> 00:29:45.532
How old is she?

434
00:29:45.556 --> 00:29:47.925
I don't know,
in her 30's, maybe.


435
00:29:47.949 --> 00:29:50.102
What does she...
What does she look like?


436
00:29:50.126 --> 00:29:52.626
Real pretty, but she's weird.

437
00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.671
Lisa and I were like
talking at the pool,


438
00:29:54.695 --> 00:29:57.109
and she got all up in my face.

439
00:29:57.133 --> 00:29:59.198
But please,
don't tell her anything.


440
00:29:59.222 --> 00:30:01.200
She'll never talk to me again.

441
00:30:01.224 --> 00:30:04.333
Yeah, don't worry.
I won't tell her.


442
00:30:04.357 --> 00:30:05.421
All right, see you later.

443
00:30:05.445 --> 00:30:06.664
Bye.

444
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:11.558
All right.

445
00:30:11.582 --> 00:30:14.735
You look angry today.

446
00:30:14.759 --> 00:30:17.129
Well, yeah. My husband has
put himself before this family,


447
00:30:17.153 --> 00:30:19.218
so of course I'm angry.

448
00:30:19.242 --> 00:30:21.916
Gimme a break. I've always taken
a back seat in this marriage.


449
00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.483
Oh, so raising our kid

450
00:30:23.507 --> 00:30:25.267
is the same thing
as taking a back seat?


451
00:30:25.291 --> 00:30:27.226
Our kid is grown now.

452
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:30.272
She's 16.
And she believes in me.


453
00:30:30.296 --> 00:30:33.319
She feels guilty.
There is a difference, Tim.


454
00:30:33.343 --> 00:30:35.321
And you wonder why
she won't warm up to you?


455
00:30:35.345 --> 00:30:38.411
Oh, please. It has been
the two of you versus me


456
00:30:38.435 --> 00:30:40.282
since she was five.

457
00:30:40.306 --> 00:30:42.241
The inside jokes,

458
00:30:42.265 --> 00:30:45.964
the eye rolls behind my back
you think I can't see.


459
00:30:47.748 --> 00:30:50.640
I love your cooking, Tim, I do.

460
00:30:50.664 --> 00:30:52.555
You know I love your cooking,

461
00:30:52.579 --> 00:30:56.168
but the deal was is that
you would be with Lisa


462
00:30:56.192 --> 00:30:57.647
until she left the nest.

463
00:30:57.671 --> 00:31:00.911
Because it made sense
at the time.


464
00:31:00.935 --> 00:31:02.870
Seriously, why do you think
I went to culinary school?


465
00:31:02.894 --> 00:31:05.438
To pursue your dreams?
When was it my turn?


466
00:31:05.462 --> 00:31:08.571
Okay, I want you to follow
your dream, Tim, I do.


467
00:31:08.595 --> 00:31:10.660
I just don't understand
why you can't wait


468
00:31:10.684 --> 00:31:12.184
until she leaves for college.

469
00:31:12.208 --> 00:31:14.969
Because the opportunity is now.

470
00:31:14.993 --> 00:31:17.711
I get it.

471
00:31:17.735 --> 00:31:19.800
But have you even thought

472
00:31:19.824 --> 00:31:22.063
that you may just be
blowing up this family


473
00:31:22.087 --> 00:31:23.847
for a pipe dream?

474
00:31:23.871 --> 00:31:26.285
And who is Jamie?

475
00:31:26.309 --> 00:31:28.939
What? Why?

476
00:31:28.963 --> 00:31:30.506
I talked to Penny.

477
00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.465
She said this Jamie
treated her like crap


478
00:31:32.489 --> 00:31:33.988
when she stopped by last week.

479
00:31:34.012 --> 00:31:35.642
She's just a neighbor,
that's it.


480
00:31:35.666 --> 00:31:38.514
It's not uncommon to feel
threatened in situations


481
00:31:38.538 --> 00:31:41.038
when a new woman's
introduced into the mix.


482
00:31:41.062 --> 00:31:42.518
No one's introducing anyone!

483
00:31:42.542 --> 00:31:45.652
And I don't feel threatened!

484
00:31:45.676 --> 00:31:48.635
Why don't we just end it here?

485
00:31:50.507 --> 00:31:53.249
The session, not your marriage.

486
00:31:55.207 --> 00:31:57.296
You know that I'm right, Tim.

487
00:32:45.736 --> 00:32:47.931
Oh, I didn't see you.

488
00:32:47.955 --> 00:32:50.760
Do all of you Sullivans swim?

489
00:32:50.784 --> 00:32:52.893
Lisa kicks my ass every time.

490
00:32:52.917 --> 00:32:55.461
Is there room for me in there?

491
00:32:55.485 --> 00:32:56.810
It's a big pool.

492
00:32:56.834 --> 00:32:58.377
I'm not very good.

493
00:32:58.401 --> 00:33:00.988
Oh, come on, I'll show you.

494
00:33:01.012 --> 00:33:02.511
I bet you can.

495
00:33:10.717 --> 00:33:12.695
Okay, kick your legs.
Kick my legs?


496
00:33:12.719 --> 00:33:14.741
Kick your legs out.
You gotta make 'em strong.


497
00:33:14.765 --> 00:33:17.134
Stretch 'em out.
Whoo!


498
00:33:17.158 --> 00:33:20.050
Swim on your back.

499
00:33:20.074 --> 00:33:21.356
I'm gonna let you go.

500
00:33:22.425 --> 00:33:24.340
I'll race you.

501
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:29.388
I'm gonna beat you.
I'm coming.


502
00:33:30.607 --> 00:33:31.845
You won.
Whoo!


503
00:33:31.869 --> 00:33:33.499
You're fast.
I won.


504
00:33:33.523 --> 00:33:34.437
You're really good.

505
00:33:43.924 --> 00:33:45.728
Not bad for an old man, huh?

506
00:33:45.752 --> 00:33:48.949
Oh, not bad for a young man.

507
00:33:48.973 --> 00:33:51.908
So what's your story?

508
00:33:51.932 --> 00:33:53.693
What do you mean, romantically?

509
00:33:53.717 --> 00:33:54.781
Sure.

510
00:33:54.805 --> 00:33:57.349
Ugh, don't ask.

511
00:33:57.373 --> 00:34:01.353
Show me a room full of guys,
and I'll always pick the jerk.


512
00:34:01.377 --> 00:34:03.770
Right.
How'd you end up here?


513
00:34:05.685 --> 00:34:08.011
Uh...

514
00:34:08.035 --> 00:34:10.274
I moved in with my parents
last January.


515
00:34:10.298 --> 00:34:14.017
They both got cancer
around the same time.


516
00:34:14.041 --> 00:34:18.370
It's been one hell of a year,
let me tell you.


517
00:34:18.394 --> 00:34:24.376
I lost my mom in June to breast.

518
00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:28.031
And then my dad followed her
in August to colon.


519
00:34:28.055 --> 00:34:29.598
Wow.

520
00:34:29.622 --> 00:34:33.472
He always let her go first.

521
00:34:33.496 --> 00:34:36.562
Well, I don't know you
very well,


522
00:34:36.586 --> 00:34:38.868
but it seems like you were
a pretty good daughter.


523
00:34:38.892 --> 00:34:42.568
Yeah, I hope so.

524
00:34:42.592 --> 00:34:46.746
Yeah, they left me the house.
It's just so big.


525
00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:50.619
I don't need another reminder
that I'm all out of family.


526
00:34:50.643 --> 00:34:54.884
I think I'll move in when
I have that part figured out.


527
00:34:54.908 --> 00:34:56.799
What about you?

528
00:34:56.823 --> 00:35:00.542
How are you dealing with
your mid-life madness?


529
00:35:00.566 --> 00:35:04.222
Honestly, I'm just,
I'm just worried about Lisa.


530
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.811
I mean, she could really
use a friend right now.


531
00:35:08.835 --> 00:35:10.291
I'm glad she met you.

532
00:35:10.315 --> 00:35:13.642
Sounds like she could use
a mother.


533
00:35:13.666 --> 00:35:17.124
She has a mom. It's just...

534
00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:18.821
Complicated.

535
00:35:18.845 --> 00:35:21.326
Yeah, yeah.

536
00:35:25.199 --> 00:35:27.613
What are you doing now?

537
00:35:27.637 --> 00:35:29.266
Let's go do something.

538
00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:32.748
It's a little late for coffee.

539
00:35:32.772 --> 00:35:35.447
No. I've got a better idea.
Oh, yeah?


540
00:35:35.471 --> 00:35:37.536
I know this great place, but...

541
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.885
you have to show me
you can do something first.


542
00:35:38.909 --> 00:35:40.669
Uh-oh, what?

543
00:35:40.693 --> 00:35:42.192
What?

544
00:35:42.216 --> 00:35:43.130
This.

545
00:35:52.879 --> 00:35:55.554
All right, party-time people,
are you ready?


546
00:35:55.578 --> 00:35:57.599
Yes!
I said, are you ready?


547
00:35:57.623 --> 00:35:58.731
Yes!

548
00:35:58.755 --> 00:36:01.061
Whoo! Sake bomb!

549
00:36:02.585 --> 00:36:03.847
Chug, chug, chug, chug!

550
00:36:05.152 --> 00:36:06.956
Whoo!

551
00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.089
And that's how it's done!

552
00:36:09.113 --> 00:36:10.830
All right, I'll check
on you guys later, okay?


553
00:36:10.854 --> 00:36:12.135
Thank you.

554
00:36:12.159 --> 00:36:14.181
That's four in a row.
You win.


555
00:36:14.205 --> 00:36:17.401
Oh, yeah?
What do I win?


556
00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:21.014
Oh, I don't have any prizes
on me right now.


557
00:36:21.038 --> 00:36:24.171
Keep checking. I'm sure there's
something in there worth giving.


558
00:36:26.696 --> 00:36:28.891
What do you call
these things again?


559
00:36:28.915 --> 00:36:30.632
Sake bombs.
It's in the chant.


560
00:36:30.656 --> 00:36:32.329
Right.

561
00:36:32.353 --> 00:36:33.635
They're fun.

562
00:36:33.659 --> 00:36:36.377
I'm fun.

563
00:36:36.401 --> 00:36:39.162
I can't argue with that.
You are fun.


564
00:36:39.186 --> 00:36:41.904
More than your wife?

565
00:36:41.928 --> 00:36:44.080
Heather's fun.

566
00:36:44.104 --> 00:36:46.430
Yeah, but she doesn't know you.

567
00:36:46.454 --> 00:36:47.823
She doesn't?

568
00:36:47.847 --> 00:36:49.346
I mean, I'm sure she did
at one time,


569
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:51.435
but it's been a long time.

570
00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:53.374
Tell me I'm wrong.

571
00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:01.097
You're awesome,
and you deserve the best.


572
00:37:01.121 --> 00:37:04.274
And don't let anyone
tell you different.


573
00:37:04.298 --> 00:37:06.015
I know you got this wife,

574
00:37:06.039 --> 00:37:08.975
and you're not quite sure
what to do with her,


575
00:37:08.999 --> 00:37:12.108
but if you had the right wife,

576
00:37:12.132 --> 00:37:14.067
you'd know what to do.

577
00:37:14.091 --> 00:37:15.396
Wouldn't you?

578
00:37:18.661 --> 00:37:20.943
Wait a second, wait a second.

579
00:37:20.967 --> 00:37:22.858
Hold on.
What am I doing here?


580
00:37:22.882 --> 00:37:24.710
You're having fun.

581
00:37:39.856 --> 00:37:42.399
You know what?
I shouldn't, actually.


582
00:37:42.423 --> 00:37:45.315
No, you can, you can.
I can?


583
00:37:45.339 --> 00:37:47.013
You can.
Why can I?


584
00:37:47.037 --> 00:37:49.517
'Cause you can.

585
00:37:57.047 --> 00:37:59.982
You know what?
Actually, I can't do this.


586
00:38:00.006 --> 00:38:03.638
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I really shouldn't.


587
00:38:03.662 --> 00:38:05.553
You can.
I shouldn't.


588
00:38:05.577 --> 00:38:06.859
You can.

589
00:38:06.883 --> 00:38:08.232
I can?

590
00:38:11.017 --> 00:38:14.170
Come on, come on.

591
00:38:14.194 --> 00:38:16.651
No, over here.

592
00:38:16.675 --> 00:38:17.676
There you go.

593
00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:24.833
I'm serious.
I am a little drunk.


594
00:38:24.857 --> 00:38:25.921
I know.

595
00:38:27.643 --> 00:38:30.360
You are more than a little...

596
00:38:30.384 --> 00:38:32.101
You gotta go.

597
00:38:32.125 --> 00:38:35.017
No.
You gotta go.


598
00:38:35.041 --> 00:38:36.913
I'm sorry.

599
00:38:40.438 --> 00:38:44.331
Just a little...

600
00:38:46.009 --> 00:38:48.770
I'm sorry. Just...

601
00:39:00.197 --> 00:39:02.915
Look, I have a family.

602
00:39:02.939 --> 00:39:05.657
Good for you.

603
00:39:05.681 --> 00:39:07.310
I'm sorry.
No.


604
00:39:07.334 --> 00:39:08.858
I'm gonna go.

605
00:39:12.557 --> 00:39:14.690
Jamie, come on.
I'm sorry!


606
00:39:32.011 --> 00:39:34.424
Lisa!

607
00:39:34.448 --> 00:39:35.449
Lisa!

608
00:39:38.801 --> 00:39:40.909
How'd you find out
where my dad lives?


609
00:39:40.933 --> 00:39:43.782
I called your mom.
She says hi.


610
00:39:43.806 --> 00:39:46.001
Why won't you return my texts?

611
00:39:46.025 --> 00:39:48.090
If it makes you feel better,
you're the only one.


612
00:39:48.114 --> 00:39:49.918
Why would that make me
feel any better?


613
00:39:49.942 --> 00:39:52.660
Am I just like
everyone else now?


614
00:39:52.684 --> 00:39:54.401
Hey, hey, hey!

615
00:39:54.425 --> 00:39:56.446
You get away from her!

616
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:59.014
Excuse me?
I'm her boyfriend.


617
00:39:59.038 --> 00:40:02.104
Oh, you're the guy that left
the bruises on her arm.


618
00:40:02.128 --> 00:40:03.802
What?

619
00:40:03.826 --> 00:40:06.282
No. You know I would never
mean to hurt you.


620
00:40:06.306 --> 00:40:08.023
I never said you did.

621
00:40:08.047 --> 00:40:09.851
Don't make excuses for him.

622
00:40:09.875 --> 00:40:13.289
Okay, look, just leave us alone.

623
00:40:13.313 --> 00:40:15.335
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!


624
00:40:15.359 --> 00:40:17.903
You better get out of here
before I call the cops.


625
00:40:17.927 --> 00:40:20.340
Jamie, what are you doing?
He's not bothering me at all!


626
00:40:20.364 --> 00:40:21.863
Yeah, well, he's bothering me.

627
00:40:21.887 --> 00:40:23.343
Okay, just calm down.

628
00:40:23.367 --> 00:40:26.370
We'll talk another time.

629
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:32.004
Jamie, what the hell was that?
You've got it all wrong!


630
00:40:32.028 --> 00:40:34.746
Okay, okay, you're right.

631
00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:36.878
I can be overly
protective sometimes.


632
00:40:36.902 --> 00:40:38.619
Okay? Let me
make it up to you.


633
00:40:38.643 --> 00:40:39.881
How?

634
00:40:39.905 --> 00:40:41.689
Come on.

635
00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:51.134
Cheers.

636
00:40:55.138 --> 00:40:57.029
Do not tell your dad about this.

637
00:40:57.053 --> 00:40:58.987
You don't tell my dad.

638
00:40:59.011 --> 00:41:00.293
Where is he, by the way?

639
00:41:00.317 --> 00:41:02.948
Inventory at the restaurant.

640
00:41:02.972 --> 00:41:04.645
So does he know about...
What's the jerk's name?


641
00:41:04.669 --> 00:41:06.995
I told you, he's a nice guy.

642
00:41:07.019 --> 00:41:09.084
Don't be a victim, Lisa.

643
00:41:09.108 --> 00:41:11.347
He's pathetic, and he knows it.

644
00:41:13.504 --> 00:41:15.438
Where'd you learn those
tricks out there anyway?


645
00:41:15.462 --> 00:41:17.136
It was pretty badass.

646
00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.659
Krav magra.

647
00:41:18.683 --> 00:41:20.903
I've had a few jerks
in my life too.


648
00:41:23.601 --> 00:41:25.361
I'm so tired.

649
00:41:25.385 --> 00:41:27.755
You've got a lot going on.

650
00:41:27.779 --> 00:41:33.021
You've got school, swimming,
that guy, your folks.


651
00:41:33.045 --> 00:41:35.807
I keep having
this weird nightmare.


652
00:41:35.831 --> 00:41:37.809
I'm swimming, and I'm winning,

653
00:41:37.833 --> 00:41:41.377
and I'm like,
"Give me the trophy."


654
00:41:41.401 --> 00:41:46.556
But then, my arms and
my legs fill up with lead,


655
00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.471
and I'm gripping
at the edge of the pool


656
00:41:48.495 --> 00:41:51.866
and everybody's staring at me,

657
00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:56.610
my teachers, the students,
even the janitor,


658
00:41:56.634 --> 00:42:00.701
and they're all thinking
the same thing.


659
00:42:00.725 --> 00:42:03.269
They're thinking,

660
00:42:03.293 --> 00:42:05.924
"She's barely hanging on."

661
00:42:05.948 --> 00:42:07.340
Don't stop there.

662
00:42:08.994 --> 00:42:11.973
Finish what you're gonna say.

663
00:42:11.997 --> 00:42:17.544
It's just like I pictured
my senior year so differently,


664
00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:19.589
and then seeing my dad,
he's so happy,


665
00:42:19.613 --> 00:42:23.985
but he couldn't have
picked a worse time.


666
00:42:24.009 --> 00:42:27.708
And I can't say anything to him.
He's done so much for me.


667
00:42:30.276 --> 00:42:32.385
He's like the only person
I talk to, other than my shrink.


668
00:42:32.409 --> 00:42:34.039
Well, and me.

669
00:42:34.063 --> 00:42:36.152
Yeah, and you.

670
00:42:39.329 --> 00:42:42.134
I just feel...

671
00:42:42.158 --> 00:42:44.092
out of control.

672
00:42:44.116 --> 00:42:47.617
Oh. Oh.

673
00:42:47.641 --> 00:42:49.643
I've got something for that.

674
00:43:00.306 --> 00:43:02.589
Whoo! Every time!

675
00:43:02.613 --> 00:43:03.895
Really? Every time?

676
00:43:03.919 --> 00:43:06.071
Yeah, every time.

677
00:43:06.095 --> 00:43:08.029
You wanna try?

678
00:43:08.053 --> 00:43:10.727
Just aim and squeeze.

679
00:43:10.751 --> 00:43:14.470
Just don't tell your dad
about it.


680
00:43:14.494 --> 00:43:17.865
Come on, Sullivan, you've
got a pistol in your hand.


681
00:43:17.889 --> 00:43:19.891
Right there, go ahead.

682
00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:26.158
Try it again.
Okay.


683
00:43:32.556 --> 00:43:34.490
Okay, yeah, we gotta
work on your aim.


684
00:43:34.514 --> 00:43:37.276
But you know something
that'll help your shot?


685
00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:39.147
What? Tell me.

686
00:43:39.171 --> 00:43:41.410
You just gotta picture somebody
that you absolutely hate.


687
00:43:41.434 --> 00:43:43.238
Like Steven.
What?


688
00:43:43.262 --> 00:43:45.501
I bet you you could drive
a bullet through his skull.


689
00:43:45.525 --> 00:43:47.721
What, no!
I don't hate Steven,


690
00:43:47.745 --> 00:43:50.332
and I certainly don't
wanna kill him. Here.


691
00:43:50.356 --> 00:43:53.553
Come on!
It was just a joke!


692
00:43:53.577 --> 00:43:55.685
Oh, come on, don't hate me.

693
00:43:55.709 --> 00:43:57.992
No, I don't hate you, Jamie.
I didn't like what you said.


694
00:43:58.016 --> 00:44:00.168
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
You know what?


695
00:44:00.192 --> 00:44:02.475
I've just been really,
really emotional, okay?


696
00:44:02.499 --> 00:44:04.066
Sorry.

697
00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:25.261
Place looks great.

698
00:44:27.785 --> 00:44:31.417
What's it take for a girl
to get a drink around here?


699
00:44:31.441 --> 00:44:33.617
We're not open yet, but I guess
I can make an exception.


700
00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.707
Whiskey.

701
00:44:47.631 --> 00:44:49.739
Mmm.

702
00:44:49.763 --> 00:44:51.350
Do you know what I love
about whiskey?


703
00:44:51.374 --> 00:44:52.786
What?

704
00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:56.050
Everything.
Have a drink with me.


705
00:44:56.074 --> 00:44:59.706
Uh, no.
Just one.


706
00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:02.665
I can't. I got a thousand things
to do before we open.


707
00:45:02.689 --> 00:45:08.434
Oh, there he goes again,
following all the rules.


708
00:45:20.794 --> 00:45:22.033
About the other night...

709
00:45:22.057 --> 00:45:24.252
Yes, about the other night.

710
00:45:24.276 --> 00:45:27.603
Look, uh, I'm really sorry.
I really am.


711
00:45:27.627 --> 00:45:30.476
I, um, I was having fun,

712
00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.478
but I shouldn't have
started something


713
00:45:32.502 --> 00:45:34.349
that I knew I couldn't finish.

714
00:45:34.373 --> 00:45:36.047
Mmm.

715
00:45:36.071 --> 00:45:37.787
Shouldn't or couldn't?

716
00:45:37.811 --> 00:45:43.010
Because you can and you should.

717
00:45:43.034 --> 00:45:45.230
I'm married.

718
00:45:45.254 --> 00:45:47.580
I don't see your wife
around here.


719
00:45:47.604 --> 00:45:50.148
Have you ever thought
that maybe there's a reason


720
00:45:50.172 --> 00:45:54.195
I entered your life
at this exact moment?


721
00:45:54.219 --> 00:45:56.850
You know,
fate can be a fickle thing.


722
00:45:56.874 --> 00:46:01.855
If you ignore its signs,
it just goes away.


723
00:46:01.879 --> 00:46:06.033
And I don't think you want me
going away, do you, Tim?


724
00:46:06.057 --> 00:46:08.383
Tim!

725
00:46:08.407 --> 00:46:09.930
Think about it.

726
00:46:18.765 --> 00:46:20.134
Who was that?

727
00:46:20.158 --> 00:46:21.962
Neighbor at my apartment.

728
00:46:21.986 --> 00:46:23.268
You two, uh...
No.


729
00:46:23.292 --> 00:46:25.618
No, and I'm not.

730
00:46:25.642 --> 00:46:27.663
I got way too much at stake.

731
00:46:27.687 --> 00:46:29.578
Heather would
absolutely kill me.


732
00:46:29.602 --> 00:46:31.038
Hmm.

733
00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:01.784
Teacher's so annoying.
I have to go to practice now.


734
00:47:01.808 --> 00:47:04.831
I'll see you around.
See ya.


735
00:47:04.855 --> 00:47:06.267
Jamie?
I'm here to kidnap you.


736
00:47:06.291 --> 00:47:07.964
What?
Let's go catch a movie.


737
00:47:07.988 --> 00:47:10.619
I can't.
Why?


738
00:47:10.643 --> 00:47:12.230
I have swim practice.

739
00:47:12.254 --> 00:47:13.883
Come on, blow it off.

740
00:47:13.907 --> 00:47:15.885
Jamie, I can't leave school
right now.


741
00:47:15.909 --> 00:47:19.280
Okay. You know what?
You're totally right.


742
00:47:19.304 --> 00:47:21.630
You should go do
your swim thing.


743
00:47:21.654 --> 00:47:23.613
Thanks.

744
00:47:25.963 --> 00:47:29.029
Okay, then.
See you later! Bye!


745
00:47:29.053 --> 00:47:31.229
Freak.

746
00:47:40.369 --> 00:47:43.609
Come on, Sullivan,
kick those legs!


747
00:47:43.633 --> 00:47:45.896
Here you come!
Come on!


748
00:47:51.075 --> 00:47:54.010
Whew!

749
00:47:54.034 --> 00:47:55.969
What's come over you?

750
00:47:55.993 --> 00:47:58.928
You're really killing it
today. Wow.


751
00:47:58.952 --> 00:48:02.671
I guess I just finally
got a grip on things.


752
00:48:02.695 --> 00:48:06.153
That's a good thing 'cause
we got Somerville coming up.


753
00:48:06.177 --> 00:48:08.721
I heard those girls have
chlorine in their veins.


754
00:48:08.745 --> 00:48:11.289
And you've got the tools
to beat every single one of 'em.


755
00:48:11.313 --> 00:48:12.594
No pressure.

756
00:48:12.618 --> 00:48:14.901
Look, just do your best.

757
00:48:14.925 --> 00:48:17.295
That's all I've been trying to
tell you to do all this time.


758
00:48:17.319 --> 00:48:19.558
Don't surrender,
don't retreat, never give up.


759
00:48:19.582 --> 00:48:22.387
I think I can do that.

760
00:48:22.411 --> 00:48:23.629
You think?

761
00:48:25.414 --> 00:48:27.087
I can do that.

762
00:48:27.111 --> 00:48:28.349
Get back in the water.

763
00:49:04.496 --> 00:49:06.169
Hi.
Hi.


764
00:49:06.193 --> 00:49:09.434
Are you...
I'm just dropping this off.


765
00:49:09.458 --> 00:49:13.220
Oh, yeah, I guess her clothes
have two homes now.


766
00:49:13.244 --> 00:49:15.222
Yeah.

767
00:49:15.246 --> 00:49:19.119
So hey, you got any of that
great coffee going on in there?


768
00:49:20.556 --> 00:49:23.820
Um, yeah, come on in.

769
00:49:36.049 --> 00:49:38.027
Here you go.
Mmm.


770
00:49:38.051 --> 00:49:41.292
So tomorrow is your
big opening. Are you ready?


771
00:49:41.316 --> 00:49:43.468
If by "ready,"
you mean haven't slept in days


772
00:49:43.492 --> 00:49:46.471
and breaking into cold sweats
every 10 minutes,


773
00:49:46.495 --> 00:49:47.994
I'm ready.

774
00:49:48.018 --> 00:49:51.040
You coming?
Is Jamie going?


775
00:49:51.064 --> 00:49:52.805
I don't know, probably.

776
00:49:55.242 --> 00:49:58.961
I hope you come. I could really
use some friendly faces around.


777
00:49:58.985 --> 00:50:02.269
This look like a friendly face?

778
00:50:02.293 --> 00:50:04.358
Downright chummy.

779
00:50:04.382 --> 00:50:06.317
I really don't
want her there, Tim.


780
00:50:06.341 --> 00:50:08.623
Ah, what's the big deal?

781
00:50:08.647 --> 00:50:11.583
Hopefully, it'll be so busy,
we'll never notice her.


782
00:50:11.607 --> 00:50:15.108
Come on, me or her?
Who do you want there, Tim?


783
00:50:15.132 --> 00:50:16.655
Okay.

784
00:50:18.265 --> 00:50:19.745
Okay, fine.

785
00:50:22.661 --> 00:50:24.857
See you at the opening.
It means the world to me.


786
00:50:24.881 --> 00:50:25.945
Okay.
All right.


787
00:50:25.969 --> 00:50:27.013
Bye.

788
00:51:25.332 --> 00:51:28.094
I'm really glad you came, Mom.

789
00:51:28.118 --> 00:51:31.837
Look, I want your Dad to win
just as much as you do.


790
00:51:31.861 --> 00:51:34.274
We might be going through
a little something right now,


791
00:51:34.298 --> 00:51:37.016
but I still love him.

792
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.800
We just hit a speed bump.

793
00:51:38.824 --> 00:51:41.542
It happens
to the best marriages.


794
00:51:41.566 --> 00:51:44.589
Some just take
a little longer to clear.


795
00:51:44.613 --> 00:51:46.678
Dr. Fischer
been getting to you too?


796
00:51:46.702 --> 00:51:48.549
You might be onto
something there.


797
00:51:50.401 --> 00:51:52.292
So who is this Jamie
that you've befriended?


798
00:51:52.316 --> 00:51:53.989
How do you know about Jamie?

799
00:51:54.013 --> 00:51:56.992
Penny told me.

800
00:51:57.016 --> 00:51:59.734
Don't be mad, Lisa.
She was worried about you.


801
00:51:59.758 --> 00:52:02.433
No, I'm not mad.

802
00:52:02.457 --> 00:52:04.217
She was actually right
about her.


803
00:52:04.241 --> 00:52:06.741
But Jamie was really cool
with me, Mom.


804
00:52:06.765 --> 00:52:08.613
She was there when I needed her.

805
00:52:08.637 --> 00:52:10.571
Okay. I guess I could
thank her for that.


806
00:52:10.595 --> 00:52:13.052
No, don't bother.
I'm so over it.


807
00:52:13.076 --> 00:52:14.270
Yeah?
Yeah.


808
00:52:14.294 --> 00:52:15.750
She's like way too much.

809
00:52:15.774 --> 00:52:17.839
Hmm.

810
00:52:17.863 --> 00:52:19.735
Let's go, come on.

811
00:52:29.396 --> 00:52:31.287
Wow.

812
00:52:31.311 --> 00:52:32.463
Welcome!

813
00:52:32.487 --> 00:52:34.029
It looks amazing!

814
00:52:34.053 --> 00:52:35.727
Thank you very much.
Thanks for coming. Come.


815
00:52:35.751 --> 00:52:38.493
I've got the best seats
in the house. Come.


816
00:52:42.235 --> 00:52:44.257
Thank you.

817
00:52:44.281 --> 00:52:45.737
I'll let Tim know you're here.

818
00:52:45.761 --> 00:52:47.414
Great.
All right.


819
00:52:49.329 --> 00:52:50.742
Hey, Tim.
Yeah?


820
00:52:50.766 --> 00:52:52.202
Your family's here.

821
00:52:57.163 --> 00:52:58.663
Exciting.

822
00:52:58.687 --> 00:53:00.534
Hey.
How are you?


823
00:53:00.558 --> 00:53:03.668
Oh, my God, it's packed.
What did I tell you?


824
00:53:03.692 --> 00:53:05.844
You were right, kiddo.
Are you nervous?


825
00:53:05.868 --> 00:53:08.063
Not now. You staying for brunch,
both of you?


826
00:53:08.087 --> 00:53:09.195
Of course.

827
00:53:09.219 --> 00:53:11.197
Good. Wish me luck.

828
00:53:11.221 --> 00:53:12.546
Good luck.
Good luck.


829
00:53:12.570 --> 00:53:14.354
Okay, I'll see you soon.

830
00:53:20.143 --> 00:53:21.337
Here you go.

831
00:53:21.361 --> 00:53:23.557
Thank you.
Thank you.


832
00:53:23.581 --> 00:53:25.254
You're Tim's family, right?

833
00:53:25.278 --> 00:53:26.865
That's us.

834
00:53:26.889 --> 00:53:31.478
Oh, lucky.
His cooking gives me life.


835
00:53:31.502 --> 00:53:33.045
It gives her life?

836
00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:34.786
She means it's amazing, Mom.

837
00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:39.858
Oh. Bet you Jamie
would've known that, huh?


838
00:53:46.473 --> 00:53:48.016
Oh, my God, here she comes.

839
00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.583
Who? What do you mean?

840
00:53:49.607 --> 00:53:52.238
Hi, Jamie.
Hi.


841
00:53:52.262 --> 00:53:53.935
You must be
the infamous neighbor


842
00:53:53.959 --> 00:53:55.328
I've heard so much about.

843
00:53:55.352 --> 00:53:56.938
In the flesh.

844
00:53:56.962 --> 00:54:00.333
I'm Heather,
Lisa's mom, Tim's wife.


845
00:54:00.357 --> 00:54:01.943
I'm assuming
you've heard of me too.


846
00:54:01.967 --> 00:54:04.685
I know who you are.
Now what?


847
00:54:04.709 --> 00:54:07.122
Now I'm gonna ask you
to politely walk away.


848
00:54:07.146 --> 00:54:08.820
Or what?

849
00:54:08.844 --> 00:54:11.562
Or I'll ask you not so politely.

850
00:54:11.586 --> 00:54:15.217
You can ask me any way you want.
I'm not going anywhere.


851
00:54:15.241 --> 00:54:17.437
I have just as much right
to be here as you.


852
00:54:17.461 --> 00:54:18.656
Oh, is that what you think?

853
00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.875
Okay, come on, time to go.

854
00:54:20.899 --> 00:54:22.442
I just got here!

855
00:54:25.164 --> 00:54:26.141
What?

856
00:54:26.165 --> 00:54:27.708
Sorry, sorry.

857
00:54:27.732 --> 00:54:30.668
Tim!
Jamie, you gotta go now.


858
00:54:30.692 --> 00:54:32.887
Because of her?
Tim, I got this.


859
00:54:32.911 --> 00:54:33.888
Heather, please.

860
00:54:33.912 --> 00:54:35.020
I got this.

861
00:54:35.044 --> 00:54:36.195
Let's go outside.

862
00:54:36.219 --> 00:54:37.133
Age before beauty.

863
00:54:45.489 --> 00:54:47.510
Listen, I know
what you're gonna say.


864
00:54:47.534 --> 00:54:49.730
I don't know where you came
from, and I don't wanna know.


865
00:54:49.754 --> 00:54:52.080
What I do want is for you
to listen to me right now.


866
00:54:52.104 --> 00:54:55.518
God, you do look older
than in your pictures.


867
00:54:55.542 --> 00:54:57.869
Don't waste your time
trying to insult me, girlie.


868
00:54:57.893 --> 00:54:59.435
There's nothing you can say

869
00:54:59.459 --> 00:55:00.698
that will shake
this woman's confidence.


870
00:55:00.722 --> 00:55:02.047
Are you sure about that?

871
00:55:02.071 --> 00:55:03.483
I don't care what kinda bond

872
00:55:03.507 --> 00:55:05.006
you think you formed with them.

873
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:06.747
It never happened.

874
00:55:06.771 --> 00:55:10.708
Even if you think it did in that
sick little mind of yours,


875
00:55:10.732 --> 00:55:12.100
it's over now.

876
00:55:12.124 --> 00:55:14.973
My husband, my kid, my family.

877
00:55:14.997 --> 00:55:19.218
Hmm, interesting
'cause I think...


878
00:55:20.785 --> 00:55:23.546
...that's your husband
kissing my neck.


879
00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:26.201
And, oh, there's my hand
on his chest.


880
00:55:26.225 --> 00:55:28.639
And oop!

881
00:55:28.663 --> 00:55:32.555
Guess what part of me got
involved right after this one.


882
00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:36.342
Don't be jealous, Heather.
You can't fight fate.


883
00:55:36.366 --> 00:55:38.083
Last warning.

884
00:55:38.107 --> 00:55:41.042
If you come near my family
again, I will end you.


885
00:55:41.066 --> 00:55:43.436
You understand me?

886
00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.853
Tell Lisa I'll call.

887
00:55:53.383 --> 00:55:56.362
You slept with her.
Oh, my God.


888
00:55:56.386 --> 00:55:57.755
What, what? No, I... No!

889
00:55:57.779 --> 00:55:59.757
She showed me the pictures!

890
00:55:59.781 --> 00:56:02.107
All we did was kiss, I swear.

891
00:56:02.131 --> 00:56:03.761
We were crazy drunk, Heather.
I swear it.


892
00:56:03.785 --> 00:56:06.720
I must be the crazy one.
Lisa, come on. Please, honey.


893
00:56:06.744 --> 00:56:09.418
Mom.
It's okay. I'll call later.


894
00:56:09.442 --> 00:56:11.749
Yeah, so will
your slutty neighbor.


895
00:56:16.058 --> 00:56:18.974
Tim, we need to talk.

896
00:56:24.936 --> 00:56:28.699
What the hell was that?

897
00:56:28.723 --> 00:56:30.788
Sorry. It won't happen again.
Yeah, damn straight.


898
00:56:30.812 --> 00:56:34.052
You need to keep that psycho
out of here, all right?


899
00:56:34.076 --> 00:56:37.272
I have got a lot of money
riding on this place, Tim.


900
00:56:37.296 --> 00:56:38.863
Please don't make me
regret this.


901
00:57:13.332 --> 00:57:15.484
Give me one good reason
not to hang up on you.


902
00:57:15.508 --> 00:57:17.225
Heather, I was drunk.
It was after that big fight


903
00:57:17.249 --> 00:57:19.010
we had at Dr. Fischer's office.

904
00:57:19.034 --> 00:57:20.751
Why should I believe you?

905
00:57:20.775 --> 00:57:22.796
'Cause I'm telling
the truth, I swear.


906
00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:25.146
We were just figuring
this thing out, weren't we?


907
00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:26.365
Let's not let her
get in the middle of this.


908
00:57:26.389 --> 00:57:27.888
Look, I'm at work.

909
00:57:27.912 --> 00:57:30.673
I have to go.
Goodbye, Tim.


910
00:57:30.697 --> 00:57:32.787
All right, bye.

911
00:57:36.878 --> 00:57:39.117
Your family?

912
00:57:39.141 --> 00:57:42.685
Yes.
Nice.


913
00:57:42.709 --> 00:57:45.297
So do you have any questions
about the documents?


914
00:57:48.672 --> 00:57:51.564
I really have no idea
what it is I'm looking at here.


915
00:57:51.588 --> 00:57:53.871
Oh, I can certainly explain.

916
00:57:53.895 --> 00:57:57.657
No, I trust you.
Thanks for your time on this.


917
00:57:57.681 --> 00:57:58.963
You're very welcome, Mr. Clark.

918
00:57:58.987 --> 00:58:00.965
Call me Patrick.

919
00:58:00.989 --> 00:58:06.579
Patrick, I was wondering.
Um...


920
00:58:06.603 --> 00:58:10.322
How would you like to earn
a big fat discount on my time?


921
00:58:10.346 --> 00:58:12.541
How big and fat we talkin'?

922
00:58:12.565 --> 00:58:15.196
I was thinking free.

923
00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:21.202
What exactly is it
that you need, Mrs. Sullivan?


924
00:58:21.226 --> 00:58:22.793
Call me Heather.

925
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.913
Answer.

926
00:58:59.569 --> 00:59:00.831
Answer!

927
00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.986
This is Lisa.
Leave a message.


928
00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:08.249
Ugh! Damn it!

929
00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:19.043
Lisa?
Steven.


930
00:59:19.067 --> 00:59:21.219
Who was that weird lady
you were with the other day?


931
00:59:21.243 --> 00:59:22.916
Jamie, my dad's new neighbor.

932
00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:24.962
What'd you tell her about us?

933
00:59:24.986 --> 00:59:28.095
Nothing. She just has
a vivid imagination.


934
00:59:28.119 --> 00:59:29.967
Look, I can't talk right now.
I have to go to practice.


935
00:59:29.991 --> 00:59:33.231
Sullivan,
what's going on over there?


936
00:59:33.255 --> 00:59:35.973
I'm just talking to
my girlfriend for a second.


937
00:59:35.997 --> 00:59:38.236
Well, your second's up, Geiger.

938
00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:39.933
Sorry, Coach.

939
00:59:39.957 --> 00:59:41.587
Now, Sullivan, get back to it.

940
00:59:41.611 --> 00:59:43.700
You gotta go.

941
01:00:07.376 --> 01:00:08.701
Hi.

942
01:00:08.725 --> 01:00:11.791
Hi. Are you okay?

943
01:00:11.815 --> 01:00:14.054
Can we talk?

944
01:00:14.078 --> 01:00:15.577
Of course.

945
01:00:15.601 --> 01:00:18.058
First, my parents split up,

946
01:00:18.082 --> 01:00:21.279
and now Steve and I
have been arguing.


947
01:00:21.303 --> 01:00:23.542
Really? What are you guys
arguing about?


948
01:00:23.566 --> 01:00:26.980
How I've been MIA lately.

949
01:00:27.004 --> 01:00:28.788
You?

950
01:00:31.139 --> 01:00:32.507
I really missed you.

951
01:00:32.531 --> 01:00:34.770
Good.

952
01:00:34.794 --> 01:00:37.295
So how's your friend Jamie?

953
01:00:37.319 --> 01:00:39.210
You were totally right.
She's crazy.


954
01:00:39.234 --> 01:00:41.081
It's like a thing now.

955
01:00:41.105 --> 01:00:43.412
Here's my girl. Come on.

956
01:00:54.771 --> 01:00:56.749
Hey, Paul. Yeah, it's me.

957
01:00:56.773 --> 01:00:59.795
No, I just talked to her.
I asked her about that lady,


958
01:00:59.819 --> 01:01:01.972
and she totally blew me off.

959
01:01:06.087 --> 01:01:07.566
I warned you, kid.

960
01:01:23.887 --> 01:01:25.038
I've been hanging out
with with someone new


961
01:01:25.062 --> 01:01:26.257
the last couple of weeks.

962
01:01:26.281 --> 01:01:29.564
Do you mean, Jamie?

963
01:01:29.588 --> 01:01:32.089
You know about Jamie, too?

964
01:01:32.113 --> 01:01:34.656
She came up in my last session
with your parents.


965
01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:40.532
Yeah, well, she turned out
to be kinda psycho.


966
01:01:40.556 --> 01:01:43.013
That's not a very nice word.

967
01:01:43.037 --> 01:01:45.058
She so did though.

968
01:01:45.082 --> 01:01:47.713
But for a while,
she was helping.


969
01:01:47.737 --> 01:01:51.369
Sometimes it's easier to open up
to a stranger than a friend.


970
01:01:51.393 --> 01:01:53.458
Less fear of being judged.

971
01:01:53.482 --> 01:01:57.549
It's one of the reasons
you and I talk so freely.


972
01:01:57.573 --> 01:02:00.421
I see you really reconciling
these emotions, Lisa.


973
01:02:00.445 --> 01:02:02.684
It's a good sign.

974
01:02:02.708 --> 01:02:05.494
I'd say you're going
to be just fine.


975
01:02:13.893 --> 01:02:15.591
Hey.

976
01:02:21.553 --> 01:02:24.097
What's wrong?

977
01:02:24.121 --> 01:02:26.143
The Lord is my shepherd.

978
01:02:26.167 --> 01:02:28.362
I shall not want.

979
01:02:28.386 --> 01:02:32.105
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures,


980
01:02:32.129 --> 01:02:34.586
leadeth me beside
the still waters.


981
01:02:34.610 --> 01:02:38.155
He restoreth my soul.

982
01:02:38.179 --> 01:02:43.334
He leadeth me in the path of
righteousness for His namesake.


983
01:02:43.358 --> 01:02:47.164
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,


984
01:02:47.188 --> 01:02:49.427
I will fear no evil,

985
01:02:49.451 --> 01:02:51.516
for thou art with me.

986
01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:56.303
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.


987
01:02:56.327 --> 01:03:00.351
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.


988
01:03:00.375 --> 01:03:04.181
Thou anointeth my head with oil.

989
01:03:04.205 --> 01:03:06.966
My cup runneth over.

990
01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:09.011
Surely goodness and virtue

991
01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:11.884
shall follow me
all of the days of my life,


992
01:03:11.908 --> 01:03:17.131
and I will dwell
in the house of Lord forever.


993
01:03:38.891 --> 01:03:41.914
You okay, kiddo?

994
01:03:41.938 --> 01:03:44.743
Not really.

995
01:03:44.767 --> 01:03:46.986
I am so sorry.

996
01:03:50.294 --> 01:03:53.732
I just...
I can't believe he's gone.


997
01:03:56.344 --> 01:03:58.496
Maybe you shouldn't swim
in tomorrow's meet, huh?


998
01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.739
I'm sure your coach
will understand.


999
01:04:03.046 --> 01:04:05.091
No, he won't, actually.

1000
01:04:22.457 --> 01:04:24.957
Yeah, yeah.

1001
01:04:24.981 --> 01:04:28.787
Um, uh-huh.

1002
01:04:28.811 --> 01:04:30.247
Uh, yeah.

1003
01:04:59.058 --> 01:05:01.994
Sam, it's Patrick.
I need a favor.


1004
01:05:02.018 --> 01:05:04.170
Yeah, Sam, I'm bored as hell
since I retired.


1005
01:05:04.194 --> 01:05:06.631
Just listen.
I need a DNA profile done.


1006
01:05:16.598 --> 01:05:19.011
Hey, I didn't see the filets.

1007
01:05:19.035 --> 01:05:21.167
I already put them inside.

1008
01:05:22.995 --> 01:05:25.060
What do you got in there?
Calamari.


1009
01:05:25.084 --> 01:05:26.975
Smells a little fishy.

1010
01:05:26.999 --> 01:05:29.567
Ha ha. Very funny.

1011
01:05:32.091 --> 01:05:34.809
Tim, hey.
What are you doing here?


1012
01:05:34.833 --> 01:05:37.377
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about the other day.


1013
01:05:37.401 --> 01:05:39.988
No, no. I mean it.
You cannot be here.


1014
01:05:40.012 --> 01:05:41.642
Okay, that's not
what you were saying


1015
01:05:41.666 --> 01:05:43.165
the other night
at your apartment.


1016
01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:44.950
That's exactly what I said.

1017
01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:47.648
Tim, did you really think
I was just gonna go away?


1018
01:05:47.672 --> 01:05:49.433
You told my wife we had sex.

1019
01:05:49.457 --> 01:05:50.477
So?

1020
01:05:50.501 --> 01:05:51.957
So that's a lie.

1021
01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:54.002
I did it for us.
Why would you do that?


1022
01:05:54.026 --> 01:05:56.918
Tim, you and I both know that
I am better for you and Lisa


1023
01:05:56.942 --> 01:05:59.138
than that bitch ever will be.
Let me show you...


1024
01:05:59.162 --> 01:06:01.401
You just stay away
from us, okay?


1025
01:06:01.425 --> 01:06:03.534
I thought you were a guy
that would never hurt his kid.


1026
01:06:03.558 --> 01:06:05.231
That's what I'm being now.

1027
01:06:05.255 --> 01:06:06.667
Why are you doing this
to our family?


1028
01:06:06.691 --> 01:06:08.258
Just go away, okay?
Now! Just...


1029
01:06:14.525 --> 01:06:18.940
How come the hottest chicks
are always the craziest, huh?


1030
01:06:18.964 --> 01:06:20.942
I need to make this
go away, Tim.


1031
01:06:20.966 --> 01:06:23.317
I think I just did.
All right.


1032
01:06:26.363 --> 01:06:29.299
Well, do you believe him?

1033
01:06:29.323 --> 01:06:31.803
That all he did was kiss her?

1034
01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.434
Yes.

1035
01:06:34.458 --> 01:06:37.461
And is that something you can
see yourself getting over?


1036
01:06:39.637 --> 01:06:42.312
Yes. She's just...

1037
01:06:42.336 --> 01:06:44.270
Ugh..

1038
01:06:44.294 --> 01:06:46.533
Well, then maybe this was
just the shakeup you two needed


1039
01:06:46.557 --> 01:06:49.014
to realize what's important
and what's not.


1040
01:06:49.038 --> 01:06:50.842
Maybe it's a good thing.

1041
01:06:50.866 --> 01:06:52.931
Let's not get crazy.

1042
01:06:52.955 --> 01:06:57.370
Though, you know, I do feel
closer to him because of it.


1043
01:06:57.394 --> 01:07:00.547
One of the flaws I've found
in human nature


1044
01:07:00.571 --> 01:07:03.095
is the ability to come together
over a common enemy.


1045
01:07:05.315 --> 01:07:06.771
Where is he anyway?

1046
01:07:06.795 --> 01:07:08.990
It's so strange
that he's running late.


1047
01:07:09.014 --> 01:07:10.688
Why is that?

1048
01:07:10.712 --> 01:07:12.472
Because I'm the one
who runs late.


1049
01:07:12.496 --> 01:07:14.909
You know, gotta work,
gotta work.


1050
01:07:14.933 --> 01:07:16.607
But?

1051
01:07:16.631 --> 01:07:20.088
When I'm being really honest
with myself,


1052
01:07:20.112 --> 01:07:23.135
I knew he was fed up
a long time ago,


1053
01:07:23.159 --> 01:07:26.312
and I ignored it

1054
01:07:26.336 --> 01:07:32.840
because, hey, you know things
were great for me, right?


1055
01:07:32.864 --> 01:07:35.365
But when I saw him
cooking in that restaurant,


1056
01:07:35.389 --> 01:07:38.977
before Hurricane Jamie
came running through the place,


1057
01:07:39.001 --> 01:07:42.110
it just, uh, it looked right.

1058
01:07:42.134 --> 01:07:44.417
Sorry. Traffic was insane.

1059
01:07:44.441 --> 01:07:47.899
It's okay.
We were just talking.


1060
01:07:47.923 --> 01:07:50.118
About what?

1061
01:07:50.142 --> 01:07:51.772
Regrets.

1062
01:07:51.796 --> 01:07:54.514
Ah, yeah. Uh, look, um...

1063
01:07:54.538 --> 01:07:57.865
Look, all I want is for our
family to be together again.


1064
01:07:57.889 --> 01:07:59.717
Nothing else matters.

1065
01:08:07.159 --> 01:08:09.442
Hey, so what do you say we go
to Lisa's swim meet together?


1066
01:08:09.466 --> 01:08:11.313
I bet she'd like that.

1067
01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:13.838
It's a date.

1068
01:08:13.862 --> 01:08:15.230
Full disclosure, Counselor,

1069
01:08:15.254 --> 01:08:17.407
I did see Jamie a few hours ago.

1070
01:08:17.431 --> 01:08:19.365
Where?
At the restaurant.


1071
01:08:19.389 --> 01:08:22.194
She stopped by and acted like
there was nothing wrong.


1072
01:08:22.218 --> 01:08:24.675
She's sick, Tim.
I'm serious.


1073
01:08:24.699 --> 01:08:27.504
I don't want Lisa
anywhere near her.


1074
01:08:27.528 --> 01:08:29.680
I parked right up here.

1075
01:08:29.704 --> 01:08:31.508
I don't think we have
to worry about it.


1076
01:08:31.532 --> 01:08:35.337
I'm pretty sure she's

1077
01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:37.296
What's wrong?

1078
01:09:24.062 --> 01:09:26.476
Lisa, Lisa!

1079
01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.521
Go, Lisa! Go, Lisa!

1080
01:09:28.545 --> 01:09:29.783
Go, go, go, Lisa!

1081
01:09:29.807 --> 01:09:32.307
Go, Lisa!
Go, go, go, Lisa!


1082
01:09:32.331 --> 01:09:34.508
Who's number one?
Whoo!


1083
01:09:37.119 --> 01:09:39.010
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?


1084
01:09:39.034 --> 01:09:40.359
You're supposed to be
concentrating.


1085
01:09:40.383 --> 01:09:42.013
Sorry, Coach, It's just, I...

1086
01:09:42.037 --> 01:09:43.710
It's just what?
Who is that?


1087
01:09:43.734 --> 01:09:45.625
Go, go, Lisa!
Don't ask.


1088
01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:47.671
Well, I'm gonna kick her out.

1089
01:09:47.695 --> 01:09:50.567
You need to get ready
'cause you're up next.


1090
01:09:52.613 --> 01:09:55.809
Go, Lisa, go, Lisa, whoo!

1091
01:09:55.833 --> 01:09:58.203
Lisa's number one!
Go, Lisa!


1092
01:09:58.227 --> 01:10:00.248
Go, Lisa!

1093
01:10:00.272 --> 01:10:01.685
Hi.
Hi.


1094
01:10:01.709 --> 01:10:03.338
How are you doing?
Good.


1095
01:10:03.362 --> 01:10:05.732
What's your name?
Jamie.


1096
01:10:05.756 --> 01:10:07.995
Can you lower your voice
a little bit?


1097
01:10:08.019 --> 01:10:10.650
'Cause you're distracting
my team.


1098
01:10:10.674 --> 01:10:12.522
I can cheer as loud as I want.

1099
01:10:12.546 --> 01:10:14.567
Oh, sure, but not today.

1100
01:10:14.591 --> 01:10:16.830
Okay, well,
I'm here for Lisa, so...


1101
01:10:16.854 --> 01:10:18.136
Well, so am I.

1102
01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:20.965
Her dad asked me
to look after her.


1103
01:10:20.989 --> 01:10:22.880
That's my job.
Just bring it down a little bit.


1104
01:10:22.904 --> 01:10:25.273
For me.

1105
01:10:25.297 --> 01:10:27.841
See that security guard
down there?


1106
01:10:27.865 --> 01:10:29.103
Well, I'm just gonna
ask him to come over


1107
01:10:29.127 --> 01:10:31.062
and ask you to leave.

1108
01:10:31.086 --> 01:10:33.194
You wanna make a big scene
about it? Okay.


1109
01:10:33.218 --> 01:10:34.848
Okay.
Okay.


1110
01:10:34.872 --> 01:10:37.788
Okay, fine, I'll go.
Good, good, good.


1111
01:10:53.108 --> 01:10:55.739
I can't believe that lunatic
trashed my car.


1112
01:10:55.763 --> 01:10:58.785
We can't prove it was her.
Do you have any doubt?


1113
01:10:58.809 --> 01:11:01.179
No. Without any evidence,
the cops have nothing to go on.


1114
01:11:01.203 --> 01:11:04.051
It's just a car, Heather.
We'll figure it out.


1115
01:11:04.075 --> 01:11:06.750
Hi. We're here for Lisa's race.
Lisa Sullivan.


1116
01:11:06.774 --> 01:11:09.448
We didn't miss it, did we?
She swims the 500 Freestyle.


1117
01:11:09.472 --> 01:11:11.319
She's coming up next.
Are you the parents?


1118
01:11:11.343 --> 01:11:12.494
Yes.
Oh, that's funny.


1119
01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:13.670
She said you were separated.

1120
01:11:13.694 --> 01:11:15.846
Yeah, we're working on that.

1121
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:19.371
Listen, she's a good kid,
so work it out.


1122
01:11:19.395 --> 01:11:20.981
Yes, Coach.
Yes, Coach.


1123
01:11:21.005 --> 01:11:23.897
So they call you "Jaws"?

1124
01:11:23.921 --> 01:11:26.073
I'm the big fish.
What can I say?


1125
01:11:27.142 --> 01:11:29.729
Great.

1126
01:11:29.753 --> 01:11:31.992
Hey, there's Nate and Penny.
Let's go join them.


1127
01:11:32.016 --> 01:11:34.018
Okay. Thank you.
Sure.


1128
01:11:36.586 --> 01:11:38.825
Good luck, Lisa.
We're rooting for you.


1129
01:11:38.849 --> 01:11:41.132
Come on, you can do this!
You got this, girl. Kill it.


1130
01:11:41.156 --> 01:11:42.742
It's fine.
You'll do great.


1131
01:11:42.766 --> 01:11:43.767
Thanks.

1132
01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:50.881
Okay, Sullivan,
this is your big day.


1133
01:11:50.905 --> 01:11:51.819
Are you ready?

1134
01:11:53.603 --> 01:11:55.799
Let me see the Phelps face.

1135
01:11:55.823 --> 01:11:57.452
Coach, no.

1136
01:11:57.476 --> 01:11:58.869
Come on, show me!

1137
01:12:01.916 --> 01:12:04.024
There it is! Okay.

1138
01:12:04.048 --> 01:12:06.007
All right, give 'em hell.

1139
01:12:11.969 --> 01:12:14.556
Quiet for the start, please.

1140
01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:17.734
On your mark, get set...

1141
01:12:27.724 --> 01:12:29.291
Come on, Lisa!
Go, go, go!


1142
01:12:33.599 --> 01:12:34.557
Come on!

1143
01:12:40.781 --> 01:12:42.478
Go, Lisa!
Come on, baby! Yes!


1144
01:12:47.744 --> 01:12:48.702
Go, go, go!
Lisa, go!


1145
01:12:50.355 --> 01:12:51.443
Come on, smooth strokes!

1146
01:12:58.146 --> 01:12:59.103
Come on! Kick it!

1147
01:13:08.678 --> 01:13:09.548
Bring it home!

1148
01:13:18.862 --> 01:13:20.734
All right!

1149
01:13:24.563 --> 01:13:25.913
Yeah!

1150
01:13:28.872 --> 01:13:30.569
Oh, yeah!

1151
01:13:32.963 --> 01:13:36.464
Lisa, Lisa,
Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa,


1152
01:13:36.488 --> 01:13:40.120
Lisa, Lisa, Lisa,
Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa!


1153
01:13:40.144 --> 01:13:42.514
Go, Lisa!

1154
01:13:49.066 --> 01:13:53.786
Three, two, one.
Go, Lisa!


1155
01:13:53.810 --> 01:13:55.812
Whoo!

1156
01:14:07.258 --> 01:14:08.670
Leave a message
for Heather Sullivan


1157
01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:10.107
after the beep.

1158
01:14:10.131 --> 01:14:12.283
Mrs. Sullivan,
this is Patrick Clark.


1159
01:14:12.307 --> 01:14:13.850
Got some info today
on your little troublemaker


1160
01:14:13.874 --> 01:14:15.416
you need to know about.

1161
01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.114
Two years ago,
she was living in Rockdale,


1162
01:14:17.138 --> 01:14:18.332
taking care
of an elderly couple,


1163
01:14:18.356 --> 01:14:20.204
a Jane and David Robertson.

1164
01:14:20.228 --> 01:14:22.206
I'm at the Robertson house
right now.


1165
01:14:22.230 --> 01:14:24.014
I'll just take
a quick look inside.


1166
01:14:52.086 --> 01:14:53.043
Holy crap.

1167
01:15:01.965 --> 01:15:04.770
Leave a message for Heather
Sullivan after the beep.


1168
01:15:15.544 --> 01:15:17.478
You were so picky
about your car.


1169
01:15:17.502 --> 01:15:19.393
You must hate this rental.

1170
01:15:19.417 --> 01:15:22.657
Not really. Change is supposed
to be good, right?


1171
01:15:22.681 --> 01:15:24.659
Right.

1172
01:15:24.683 --> 01:15:26.270
I'm sorry, Mom.

1173
01:15:26.294 --> 01:15:28.750
For what?

1174
01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:31.014
Inviting the vampire in.
And then she trashed your car.


1175
01:15:31.038 --> 01:15:33.277
Oh, you didn't know, sweetie.

1176
01:15:33.301 --> 01:15:35.583
Neither did your dad.

1177
01:15:35.607 --> 01:15:37.281
That's the thing about people.

1178
01:15:37.305 --> 01:15:39.457
They will show you
what they want you to see


1179
01:15:39.481 --> 01:15:41.700
until you look close enough
to see the truth.


1180
01:15:42.963 --> 01:15:44.679
Dr. Fischer again?

1181
01:15:44.703 --> 01:15:46.681
That one's all me.

1182
01:15:46.705 --> 01:15:48.596
Okay, Mom.
Okay.


1183
01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:49.684
Have a good one.

1184
01:15:51.406 --> 01:15:53.384
Hi.
Hi, Penny.


1185
01:15:53.408 --> 01:15:55.018
Bye, Mom.
Bye.


1186
01:16:04.027 --> 01:16:06.484
I know. It's
silly to get so excited.


1187
01:16:06.508 --> 01:16:08.834
We only live a few blocks away.

1188
01:16:08.858 --> 01:16:11.793
It's just been a while
since she let me drop her off.


1189
01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:13.404
It's been a crazy
few months for all of us,


1190
01:16:13.428 --> 01:16:17.060
but I think it's over now.

1191
01:16:17.084 --> 01:16:18.713
Jamie too?

1192
01:16:18.737 --> 01:16:21.891
I think she's learned
her lesson by now.


1193
01:16:21.915 --> 01:16:25.982
I hope so.
This has all been so draining.


1194
01:16:26.006 --> 01:16:28.114
Tell me about it.
If I didn't just start this job,


1195
01:16:28.138 --> 01:16:30.247
I would take us all
on a little vacation.


1196
01:16:30.271 --> 01:16:33.554
We'll definitely have to do it
while Lisa's away at college.


1197
01:16:33.578 --> 01:16:35.774
Oh, my God, yes.

1198
01:16:35.798 --> 01:16:38.820
Seriously, when is
the last time we went away,


1199
01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:40.605
just you and me?

1200
01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:42.215
Aruba, the little hut
on the beach.


1201
01:16:42.239 --> 01:16:44.914
Oh, yeah.

1202
01:16:44.938 --> 01:16:47.177
How soon can you be
out of your apartment?


1203
01:16:47.201 --> 01:16:50.702
I am packing up as we speak.
I will be out before lunch.


1204
01:16:50.726 --> 01:16:53.400
You better be.
I miss you.


1205
01:16:53.424 --> 01:16:54.924
All right.
I'll call you later.


1206
01:16:54.948 --> 01:16:56.253
Okay.

1207
01:17:02.433 --> 01:17:04.281
What the hell do you want?

1208
01:17:04.305 --> 01:17:07.632
Hello, Tim.
Yes, I know you're mad at me.


1209
01:17:07.656 --> 01:17:11.505
And you're right.
I took things way too far.


1210
01:17:11.529 --> 01:17:13.812
You think?
It's funny.


1211
01:17:13.836 --> 01:17:16.119
You don't know
how screwed up you really are


1212
01:17:16.143 --> 01:17:19.165
until you trash a luxury car.

1213
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:22.038
Jamie, it's not funny, okay?
At least you admit what you did.


1214
01:17:22.062 --> 01:17:23.953
But do just yourself
and everyone else a favor


1215
01:17:23.977 --> 01:17:25.998
and just get yourself
some help, please.


1216
01:17:26.022 --> 01:17:27.869
You know, believe it or not,

1217
01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:30.916
I'm actually on my way
to go see a shrink right now.


1218
01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:34.050
And that's why I'm calling you.
You need to come over.


1219
01:17:34.074 --> 01:17:36.878
Jamie, I'm not coming.

1220
01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:40.926
Look, I'm not gonna be here.
The door's unlocked.


1221
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:44.799
The thing is, I took something
that belongs to you,


1222
01:17:44.823 --> 01:17:47.889
and I feel really bad about it.

1223
01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:48.978
Whoa. What'd you take?

1224
01:17:49.002 --> 01:17:51.110
A framed family photo.

1225
01:17:51.134 --> 01:17:54.287
I found it in a box
in your closet.


1226
01:17:54.311 --> 01:17:55.985
Why? Why would you take that?

1227
01:17:56.009 --> 01:17:57.769
That's a really good question.

1228
01:17:57.793 --> 01:17:59.553
I should ask my new shrink.

1229
01:17:59.577 --> 01:18:02.034
Look, I'm sure you want it back,

1230
01:18:02.058 --> 01:18:04.689
so just come over
and get it, okay?


1231
01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:06.541
Okay.

1232
01:18:23.993 --> 01:18:26.126
Oh, my God.

1233
01:18:34.134 --> 01:18:35.831
What the hell?

1234
01:18:37.050 --> 01:18:39.313
You gotta be kidding me.

1235
01:18:42.185 --> 01:18:43.665
She's crazy.

1236
01:18:53.196 --> 01:18:55.218
All right.
Check your Instagram later.


1237
01:18:55.242 --> 01:18:56.610
I'm gonna post our song session.

1238
01:18:56.634 --> 01:18:58.525
Don't you dare.

1239
01:18:58.549 --> 01:18:59.352
Okay, I'll call you after?

1240
01:18:59.376 --> 01:19:00.658
Okay, boo.

1241
01:19:00.682 --> 01:19:02.466
Bye, chica!
Bye, girl.


1242
01:19:46.031 --> 01:19:48.140
Lisa?

1243
01:19:48.164 --> 01:19:49.533
Lisa, are you here?

1244
01:19:51.733 --> 01:19:53.798
Huh? What the...

1245
01:19:53.822 --> 01:19:55.887
Jamie?
Hi, Heather!


1246
01:19:55.911 --> 01:19:58.107
In case you're wondering,
Tim and Lisa


1247
01:19:58.131 --> 01:20:00.848
have moved in with me
at 1933 Grant Avenue.


1248
01:20:00.872 --> 01:20:02.198
Have a nice life.

1249
01:20:02.222 --> 01:20:06.027
Jamie, wait, wait,
don't hang up!


1250
01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:07.681
Please, please, please...

1251
01:20:07.705 --> 01:20:10.031
911.
What's your emergency?


1252
01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:13.687
You have to send officers
to 1933 Grant Avenue right now!


1253
01:20:13.711 --> 01:20:16.037
Ma'am, stay calm, ma'am.

1254
01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:17.909
No, I think a woman
just kidnapped my daughter!


1255
01:20:17.933 --> 01:20:19.345
You have to hurry, please!

1256
01:20:19.369 --> 01:20:20.849
Don't hang up.
Stay on the line.


1257
01:20:39.433 --> 01:20:41.174
Where am I?

1258
01:20:47.049 --> 01:20:48.766
Dad?

1259
01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:50.183
Dad.

1260
01:20:54.143 --> 01:20:56.252
Dad, please wake up.

1261
01:20:56.276 --> 01:20:58.297
Dad, please wake up!

1262
01:20:58.321 --> 01:21:00.410
Are you guys ready?

1263
01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:05.391
Look what I got!

1264
01:21:05.415 --> 01:21:07.437
Okay, now I just wanted to say

1265
01:21:07.461 --> 01:21:10.309
I'm so sorry I couldn't be there
for you yesterday.


1266
01:21:10.333 --> 01:21:12.703
There were outside forces
working against me,


1267
01:21:12.727 --> 01:21:15.271
but I am so proud of you.

1268
01:21:15.295 --> 01:21:18.056
I'm actually really proud
of our whole family.


1269
01:21:20.517 --> 01:21:24.347
And how much
does this place rock?


1270
01:21:25.783 --> 01:21:27.674
Whose house is this?

1271
01:21:27.698 --> 01:21:29.981
It used to be my parents.

1272
01:21:30.005 --> 01:21:35.073
Yeah, and I swear,
I miss them every single day,


1273
01:21:35.097 --> 01:21:38.685
even if they did put
a restraining order against me.


1274
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:40.861
Big mistake.

1275
01:21:40.885 --> 01:21:44.561
But now that I've got
a family, it's mine


1276
01:21:44.585 --> 01:21:46.650
'cause I've earned it.

1277
01:21:46.674 --> 01:21:48.652
What's going on?

1278
01:21:48.676 --> 01:21:51.045
Dad.

1279
01:21:51.069 --> 01:21:54.048
Oh, baby, I'm taking
control of things.


1280
01:21:54.072 --> 01:21:57.051
Yeah, you're in no condition
to do that,


1281
01:21:57.075 --> 01:22:00.359
and you made that very,
very clear yesterday.


1282
01:22:00.383 --> 01:22:02.535
So Jamie took the wheel,

1283
01:22:02.559 --> 01:22:05.843
and all you two have to do
is sit there and listen.


1284
01:22:05.867 --> 01:22:07.627
First things first.

1285
01:22:07.651 --> 01:22:09.523
Stop looking at me like that.

1286
01:22:11.612 --> 01:22:14.179
I am a better wife and mother
than she ever was.


1287
01:22:15.833 --> 01:22:17.574
Do you think
she has your back, baby?


1288
01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:21.598
No way. And you.

1289
01:22:21.622 --> 01:22:24.992
Do you think she'd run over
that abusive prick for you?


1290
01:22:25.016 --> 01:22:26.777
Steven?

1291
01:22:26.801 --> 01:22:28.082
Nobody hurts my girl.

1292
01:22:28.106 --> 01:22:30.563
Nobody.

1293
01:22:30.587 --> 01:22:32.261
You'll never get away with this.

1294
01:22:32.285 --> 01:22:34.983
You don't think I know
that this is temporary?


1295
01:22:36.463 --> 01:22:38.203
I'm not crazy, Tim.

1296
01:22:40.162 --> 01:22:44.055
I would rather have

1297
01:22:44.079 --> 01:22:47.058
with real family...

1298
01:22:47.082 --> 01:22:50.627
than one more second alone.

1299
01:22:50.651 --> 01:22:54.021
So what are you
gonna do with us?


1300
01:22:54.045 --> 01:22:59.157
Well, I know it's not
the popular opinion,


1301
01:22:59.181 --> 01:23:03.727
but I have always been a fan
of the murder-suicide.


1302
01:23:03.751 --> 01:23:05.772
I think it's really romantic.

1303
01:23:07.711 --> 01:23:09.887
And that way,
we'll be together in the end.


1304
01:23:11.672 --> 01:23:13.737
It's not too late!

1305
01:23:13.761 --> 01:23:15.565
Come on, Tim.

1306
01:23:15.589 --> 01:23:18.940
We both know it's too late
for anything but this.


1307
01:23:23.161 --> 01:23:27.403
The only problem is, I just...

1308
01:23:27.427 --> 01:23:29.709
I don't know which of you
to kill first.


1309
01:23:29.733 --> 01:23:31.798
Me, me, me, me!
Please, please!


1310
01:23:31.822 --> 01:23:33.234
No, Dad!

1311
01:23:33.258 --> 01:23:34.714
Dad, Dad.

1312
01:23:34.738 --> 01:23:37.848
I know.
It's like husband, daughter.


1313
01:23:37.872 --> 01:23:40.546
Husband, daughter.

1314
01:23:40.570 --> 01:23:43.332
It's a real Sophie's Choice
I'm in here.


1315
01:23:43.356 --> 01:23:45.769
Call me old-fashioned,

1316
01:23:45.793 --> 01:23:49.013
but I think
ladies should go first.


1317
01:23:51.451 --> 01:23:55.082
Please, please,
please kill me first, please.


1318
01:23:55.106 --> 01:23:57.500
Keep your shirt on.
You're next.


1319
01:23:59.372 --> 01:24:00.958
Don't worry.

1320
01:24:00.982 --> 01:24:02.351
Shh.

1321
01:24:02.375 --> 01:24:04.701
Damn you!

1322
01:24:04.725 --> 01:24:07.747
Please don't.
Please, please.


1323
01:24:07.771 --> 01:24:09.793
Lisa!

1324
01:24:09.817 --> 01:24:11.882
Everything's gonna be okay.

1325
01:24:11.906 --> 01:24:14.145
Please.

1326
01:24:14.169 --> 01:24:18.410
We all be together very soon.

1327
01:24:18.434 --> 01:24:21.263
No, no, no!
Please don't!


1328
01:24:23.221 --> 01:24:24.222
No!

1329
01:24:25.702 --> 01:24:27.400
Mom!

1330
01:24:28.488 --> 01:24:30.141
Mom!

1331
01:24:34.624 --> 01:24:36.017
Mom!

1332
01:24:50.031 --> 01:24:51.989
Mom, Dad!

1333
01:24:56.298 --> 01:24:57.212
Mom!

1334
01:25:10.399 --> 01:25:13.663
My kid, my husband, my family.

1335
01:25:31.115 --> 01:25:33.746
I thought you were
my husband and my daughter!


1336
01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:36.227
We're the perfect family!

1337
01:25:36.251 --> 01:25:39.230
No! No!

1338
01:25:39.254 --> 01:25:42.799
No!

1339
01:25:42.823 --> 01:25:45.758
No!

1340
01:25:45.782 --> 01:25:49.220
No! No!

1341
01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:02.732
So you had the tour.
That's good.


1342
01:26:02.756 --> 01:26:04.690
It's gonna take a minute
to get the lay of the land,


1343
01:26:04.714 --> 01:26:06.431
but you'll catch on.

1344
01:26:06.455 --> 01:26:08.520
They all do.

1345
01:26:08.544 --> 01:26:12.089
Now, I know how challenging
first days can be,


1346
01:26:12.113 --> 01:26:14.265
especially here,

1347
01:26:14.289 --> 01:26:16.659
so let's make a deal.

1348
01:26:16.683 --> 01:26:20.271
I'll be honest with you
if you'll be honest with me.


1349
01:26:20.295 --> 01:26:23.100
If we can do that, we can get
you to where you need to be.


1350
01:26:23.124 --> 01:26:26.799
So do you have
any questions for me?


1351
01:26:26.823 --> 01:26:29.106
You don't understand.

1352
01:26:29.130 --> 01:26:31.761
I'm not the patient.

1353
01:26:31.785 --> 01:26:34.024
I came here to work.

1354
01:26:34.048 --> 01:26:36.374
I'm an orderly, Doctor.

1355
01:26:36.398 --> 01:26:39.116
I
-I'm the new orderly.

1356
01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:40.924
Jamie.

1357
01:26:45.755 --> 01:26:48.168
You said you were
going to behave.


1358
01:26:48.192 --> 01:26:51.868
What did we just say
about honesty?


1359
01:26:51.892 --> 01:26:54.610
She's the patient, Doctor.

1360
01:26:54.634 --> 01:26:58.527
She knocked me out,
took my clothes.


1361
01:26:58.551 --> 01:27:02.293
You'd better take her
to her padded room now, please.


1362
01:27:03.556 --> 01:27:04.557
Yes, Doctor.

1363
01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:11.844
Then I'll be leaving.
My shift is over.


1364
01:27:11.868 --> 01:27:13.063
Have a good evening.

1365
01:27:13.087 --> 01:27:15.065
Oh, I will.

1366
01:27:15.089 --> 01:27:17.720
Trust me, I will.
