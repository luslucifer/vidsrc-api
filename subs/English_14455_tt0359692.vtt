"When the Last Sword is Drawn"
Film Partners present


2
00:00:26.771 --> 00:00:32.607
The City of Tokyo Winter, 1899

3
00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:51.994
What are these?

4
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.322
Here. Make sure you pack this.

5
00:00:55.467 --> 00:00:56.866
Yes, yes...

6
00:00:57.035 --> 00:00:58.468
We'll never get do.

7
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.435
Sure we will.

8
00:01:19.257 --> 00:01:20.349
Chiaki...

9
00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:23.123
...pack first, then drink.

10
00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:25.491
Yes, dear.

11
00:01:26.865 --> 00:01:30.130
We can't take half a bottle with us!

12
00:01:35.373 --> 00:01:40.367
"Ono Clinic"

13
00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:46.240
"This clinic is closed."

14
00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:51.084
"We are moving to a new location."

15
00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.681
"Chiaki Ono, M.D."

16
00:01:58.363 --> 00:01:59.728
Yes?

17
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.029
Coming, coming!

18
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.375
I realize it's late.

19
00:02:14.212 --> 00:02:18.273
My grandson has a fever that won't
go down. Would you mind?


20
00:02:18.516 --> 00:02:19.881
Come in.

21
00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:23.281
We're moving, so the place is a mess.

22
00:02:23.388 --> 00:02:26.118
Find an empty place and sit down.

23
00:02:26.258 --> 00:02:26.986
Minoru...

24
00:02:27.092 --> 00:02:28.753
There we go...

25
00:02:30.562 --> 00:02:33.087
We've got a patient!

26
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:34.491
All right.

27
00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:37.868
My wife handles the children.

28
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.997
Come in.

29
00:02:40.405 --> 00:02:42.930
There's not much room.
You go in alone.


30
00:02:45.877 --> 00:02:49.040
I don't want a needle!

31
00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.985
Minoru! Stop this nonsense!

32
00:02:59.124 --> 00:03:02.218
There's nothing to be scared of.

33
00:03:02.327 --> 00:03:04.295
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:04.396 --> 00:03:08.492
It's all right. 
Just leave that there.

35
00:03:12.937 --> 00:03:15.167
You've got a fever.

36
00:03:16.941 --> 00:03:19.375
Don't be scared.

37
00:03:21.146 --> 00:03:22.670
This gentleman...

38
00:03:23.948 --> 00:03:25.074
Who?

39
00:03:27.485 --> 00:03:29.476
Do you know him?

40
00:03:31.556 --> 00:03:32.682
No.

41
00:03:37.796 --> 00:03:41.892
How could I forget him?
Kanichiro Yoshimura...


42
00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.537
The man I hated most...

43
00:03:46.738 --> 00:03:51.437
...and in those mad days
when the Shogun fell, my comrade in...


44
00:03:51.543 --> 00:03:53.306
...'the wolves of Mibu'.

45
00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.913
WHEN THE LAST SWORD IS DRAWN

46
00:04:10.528 --> 00:04:15.261
The 'Newly Chosen Unit',
or 'Shinsengumi', was formed in 1863.


47
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.034
Quartered in Kyoto's Mibu area...

48
00:04:18.603 --> 00:04:23.063
...this group of masterless samurai
was charged with keeping the peace...


49
00:04:23.174 --> 00:04:25.734
...as the Shogun's power ebbed.

50
00:04:28.213 --> 00:04:32.115
I first saw Yoshimura
among a group of recruits...


51
00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:37.545
...selected by our Lieutenant,
Toshizo Hijikata.


52
00:04:38.757 --> 00:04:40.850
'Listed' swordsmen and above.

53
00:04:43.395 --> 00:04:46.523
First, Kanichiro Yoshimura.

54
00:04:47.098 --> 00:04:48.156
Sir!

55
00:04:50.335 --> 00:04:56.240
From Morioka, Oshu Clan.
North Star One-Sword School. Licensed.


56
00:05:03.047 --> 00:05:05.106
He's the same school as you, Ito.

57
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.675
Never seen him.

58
00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:09.843
Mr. Nagakura...

59
00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.781
How about trying one
with a real sword?


60
00:05:15.026 --> 00:05:16.823
Okita!

61
00:05:17.362 --> 00:05:21.560
It's all right. 
They're not sharp.

62
00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:34.134
Your school doesn't train
with real swords, does it.


63
00:05:34.245 --> 00:05:35.769
That's right, sir.

64
00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:44.384
Go easy on me.

65
00:05:47.492 --> 00:05:50.757
He might miss. 
Wear a protector.

66
00:05:58.136 --> 00:06:01.628
I might miss, too.
You wear one as well.


67
00:06:02.574 --> 00:06:03.472
I won't need it.

68
00:06:04.943 --> 00:06:06.069
Very well.

78
00:07:47.312 --> 00:07:51.373
He had killed.
You could see that at a glance.


79
00:07:57.922 --> 00:07:58.581
Enough!

80
00:08:03.962 --> 00:08:05.759
Not bad!

81
00:08:06.497 --> 00:08:09.295
My humble thanks.

82
00:08:10.134 --> 00:08:11.066
Yoshimura!

83
00:08:11.769 --> 00:08:12.758
Sir?

84
00:08:13.471 --> 00:08:17.066
It takes a good man
to fight Nagakura to a draw.


85
00:08:18.042 --> 00:08:22.411
You will work with him
as an instructor in swordsmanship.


86
00:08:23.514 --> 00:08:24.742
All right, Ito?

87
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:26.748
Hijikata?

88
00:08:27.719 --> 00:08:31.120
Uh, you're making me...

89
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.658
...an instructor...

90
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.951
...for the Shinsengumi?

91
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.835
Well, thank you very much!

92
00:08:52.443 --> 00:08:53.239
And now...

93
00:08:55.747 --> 00:08:59.478
...I have an announcement to make.

94
00:09:01.619 --> 00:09:02.711
Tani...

95
00:09:03.588 --> 00:09:04.885
Masatake...

96
00:09:05.323 --> 00:09:06.449
Come forward.

97
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.184
Welcome.

98
00:09:10.828 --> 00:09:13.422
I'll take your sword.

99
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.000
Sanjuro Tani's
younger brother Masatake...


100
00:09:21.172 --> 00:09:24.699
...will be adopted into my Kondo family.

101
00:09:25.476 --> 00:09:28.502
He will henceforth
be known as 'Shuhei'.


102
00:09:29.213 --> 00:09:30.771
I ask you all...

103
00:09:31.049 --> 00:09:33.779
...to give him your support.

104
00:09:34.752 --> 00:09:37.312
I ask it, too.

105
00:09:39.223 --> 00:09:41.987
The Tennen Sword school
now has an heir...


106
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.121
...to its leader!

107
00:09:56.574 --> 00:09:57.666
What are you doing?!

108
00:09:58.042 --> 00:09:58.736
Move.

109
00:09:58.843 --> 00:09:59.707
What?!

110
00:10:00.044 --> 00:10:01.602
Mr. Saito...

111
00:10:03.314 --> 00:10:06.044
...you could have just asked.

112
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:23.061
I will now entertain!

113
00:10:23.601 --> 00:10:27.037
I have a special treat for you.

114
00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:48.381
Kondo wasn't a bad man,
but he was a snob.


115
00:10:49.293 --> 00:10:54.253
His taste for distinguished families
and promotion of glib fools...


116
00:10:54.665 --> 00:10:57.600
...led to his adopting
this younger brother...


117
00:10:58.436 --> 00:11:04.705
...passing over Okita,
the natural choice to succeed him.


118
00:11:06.244 --> 00:11:09.873
Saito-sensei... have a drink.

119
00:11:13.918 --> 00:11:17.445
My name is Kanichiro Yoshimura.

120
00:11:18.122 --> 00:11:22.889
I'm a new man.
Just so you'll know who I am...


121
00:11:29.634 --> 00:11:33.832
What land are you from,
Saito-sensei?


122
00:11:35.506 --> 00:11:36.404
'Land'?

123
00:11:37.308 --> 00:11:37.774
Yes.

124
00:11:40.745 --> 00:11:44.511
I was born in Morioka,
in Nanbu, Oshu.


125
00:11:44.782 --> 00:11:47.444
It's a beautiful place.

126
00:11:48.219 --> 00:11:49.447
Please...

127
00:11:54.258 --> 00:11:58.024
Away to the south is Mt Hayachine...

128
00:11:58.429 --> 00:12:00.624
...with Mt Nansho and Mt Azumane
to the west.


129
00:12:00.832 --> 00:12:03.960
In the north are
Mt Iwate and Mt Himekami.


130
00:12:04.402 --> 00:12:09.135
Out of the high mountains
flows the Nakatsu River...


131
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.300
...through the castle town into
the Kitakami below Sakuranobaba.


132
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:17.008
Ah, it's pretty as a picture!

133
00:12:17.114 --> 00:12:20.106
There's nowhere like it in all Japan!

134
00:12:20.284 --> 00:12:23.913
Oh, please... allow me.

135
00:12:26.724 --> 00:12:31.957
Last night I dreamed
about my little girl.


136
00:12:32.296 --> 00:12:37.359
She's the image of her mother,
who was the prettiest girl in town.


137
00:12:39.337 --> 00:12:45.401
lt's just been so
long since I saw her...

138
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:51.878
An awful country samurai,
bragging about home and family.


139
00:12:53.017 --> 00:12:57.249
When I left home...

140
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.015
...she was only five.

141
00:13:05.129 --> 00:13:07.063
Even then...

142
00:13:08.499 --> 00:13:13.061
...she was such a sweet little thing
it took your breath away.


143
00:13:22.847 --> 00:13:27.580
It had been a month then
since I'd killed a man.


144
00:13:31.923 --> 00:13:34.357
My son Kaichiro...

145
00:13:34.525 --> 00:13:38.325
...is a fine swordsman and scholar.

146
00:13:38.429 --> 00:13:42.832
I don't just say that
because I'm his father.


147
00:13:43.434 --> 00:13:45.265
He'll be a fine samurai.

148
00:13:45.536 --> 00:13:48.300
I decided I'd kill this man.

149
00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:52.068
Please...

150
00:13:55.346 --> 00:13:58.747
Could you walk me back
to my lodging?


151
00:13:59.417 --> 00:14:00.543
Sorry?

152
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.786
I'm drunk, and it's not safe to go
staggering down the street alone.


153
00:14:08.993 --> 00:14:11.826
Of course.

154
00:14:31.549 --> 00:14:33.141
This should do.

155
00:14:34.085 --> 00:14:36.053
Here?

156
00:14:50.868 --> 00:14:54.998
A joke can go too far, sir.
I ask you the reason for this.


157
00:14:55.106 --> 00:14:57.074
There is no reason.

158
00:15:04.281 --> 00:15:05.942
You'd kill for no reason?

159
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:07.711
I just don't like you.

160
00:15:07.818 --> 00:15:09.285
You're crazy!

161
00:15:17.094 --> 00:15:19.187
Die!

162
00:15:22.733 --> 00:15:27.830
I can't allow that to happen.
I won't die.


163
00:15:53.464 --> 00:15:58.367
I'm not serious.
I just wanted to test you.


164
00:16:01.639 --> 00:16:06.599
I ask that this be
the last time you test me.


165
00:16:10.114 --> 00:16:14.551
You don't want to die?
What kind of samurai is that?


166
00:16:15.152 --> 00:16:20.613
No one really wants to die.
Are you any different?


167
00:16:21.125 --> 00:16:25.118
I don't care. I'm only alive
because no one will kill me.


168
00:16:26.197 --> 00:16:31.157
I'm different.
I kill because I don't want to die.


169
00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:44.805
For violating the rules of our troop,
Takito Seyama has been ordered...


170
00:16:45.249 --> 00:16:46.944
...to commit hara-kiri.

171
00:16:47.618 --> 00:16:52.920
When he has cut himself open,
you new men will remove his head.


172
00:16:53.791 --> 00:16:55.554
What is his crime?

173
00:16:56.093 --> 00:16:58.561
That doesn't concern you.

174
00:17:00.231 --> 00:17:02.062
Do not fail.

175
00:17:04.435 --> 00:17:06.562
I will obey.

176
00:17:27.024 --> 00:17:27.956
Hurry it up.

177
00:17:41.338 --> 00:17:44.671
No! Please! Stop!

178
00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:06.161
I'm truly sorry.

179
00:18:08.065 --> 00:18:10.056
Forgive me.

180
00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.229
Payment.

181
00:18:18.075 --> 00:18:20.043
Go have fun in Shimabara.

182
00:18:24.448 --> 00:18:26.313
Don't you want it?

183
00:18:27.551 --> 00:18:29.542
I can't accept this!

184
00:18:31.722 --> 00:18:33.121
I see.

185
00:18:38.295 --> 00:18:40.126
Hijikata-sensei...

186
00:18:40.998 --> 00:18:45.526
...as you're aware,
the circumstances...


187
00:18:46.136 --> 00:18:49.071
...made the task quite difficult.

188
00:18:49.406 --> 00:18:53.775
It caused a chip in the blade
of my sword.


189
00:18:54.211 --> 00:18:59.706
Could I perhaps ask for
the cost of a new sword?


190
00:19:10.828 --> 00:19:13.729
That should do. Your blade
doesn't bear its maker's name.


191
00:19:49.066 --> 00:19:51.694
You're too kind.

192
00:20:00.978 --> 00:20:02.775
My humble thanks!

193
00:20:10.688 --> 00:20:14.055
What kind of a samurai is that?

194
00:20:14.158 --> 00:20:16.718
He's really something!

195
00:20:27.504 --> 00:20:29.438
Where's it chipped?

196
00:20:32.576 --> 00:20:36.774
My sword's as worn down as I am.

197
00:20:38.949 --> 00:20:43.613
The Shinsengumi was the sterile flower
of the Shoguns' end.


198
00:20:44.254 --> 00:20:49.521
And here was this miser
squirreling away all he could.


199
00:20:58.836 --> 00:21:02.363
We're checking to make sure
it's nothing contagious.


200
00:21:02.473 --> 00:21:05.101
It"ll take a bit more time.

201
00:21:06.243 --> 00:21:07.608
I'm sorry.

202
00:21:08.045 --> 00:21:10.343
I've come at a bad time.

203
00:21:14.218 --> 00:21:16.379
Would you like a drink?

204
00:21:18.222 --> 00:21:21.851
A lot of our patients
pay their bills with alcohol.


205
00:21:21.959 --> 00:21:26.259
We're moving tomorrow,
and we have all that left...


206
00:21:27.598 --> 00:21:30.567
Oh...

207
00:21:31.402 --> 00:21:33.666
I don't know what to say...

208
00:21:34.371 --> 00:21:39.274
I heard you'd accept alcohol
for your fee...


209
00:21:42.579 --> 00:21:47.846
If you gave me money,
I'd just buy liquor with it.


210
00:21:50.554 --> 00:21:52.351
You're too kind.

211
00:21:55.092 --> 00:21:58.493
Anyway, have a drink.

212
00:21:59.029 --> 00:22:01.725
You're too kind.

213
00:22:08.205 --> 00:22:10.799
Your father?

214
00:22:11.942 --> 00:22:12.931
Hm?

215
00:22:14.511 --> 00:22:15.535
Oh...

216
00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:17.742
No.

217
00:22:29.326 --> 00:22:33.888
That gentleman was my teacher.

218
00:22:35.232 --> 00:22:39.794
Morioka is 140 leagues from Edo...

219
00:22:40.204 --> 00:22:44.664
...at the end of the Oshu road,
and not blessed like the west country.


220
00:22:45.542 --> 00:22:50.343
To stand up for your own land against
the children of those rich ones...


221
00:22:50.547 --> 00:22:54.074
...is no easy thing.

222
00:22:55.052 --> 00:23:00.854
The Morioka cherry blossom
splits through rock to bloom.


223
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:07.690
The Morioka magnolia blooms
even facing north.


224
00:23:11.802 --> 00:23:16.535
So I don't want you to wait
until spring comes...


225
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.970
...and it's nice and warm.

226
00:23:21.545 --> 00:23:22.842
Split that rock.

227
00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:28.481
Run ahead of the times.

228
00:23:30.387 --> 00:23:34.756
Go wild. Bloom.

229
00:23:35.292 --> 00:23:38.784
Yoshlmura-sensei was
a low-ranked samurai...


230
00:23:39.396 --> 00:23:43.059
...known for his learning
and swordsmanship.


231
00:23:43.166 --> 00:23:46.966
Our clan made him a teacher
at its school.


232
00:23:53.243 --> 00:23:55.234
Squire Chiaki!

233
00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.674
Your body's wide open.
Keep your arms down!


234
00:24:05.656 --> 00:24:06.816
Good, Kaichiro!

235
00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:10.526
His son Kaichiro
was like him... strong...


236
00:24:11.962 --> 00:24:13.623
...and gentle.

237
00:24:14.331 --> 00:24:15.992
Are you all right?

238
00:24:16.667 --> 00:24:19.659
'Let's go to the peach tree.'

239
00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:20.600
Mitsu...

240
00:24:21.838 --> 00:24:23.499
Shizu... I'm back.

241
00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:28.602
Welcome home.

242
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.041
Hello, Squire Ono.

243
00:24:36.453 --> 00:24:38.387
Come in.

244
00:24:39.089 --> 00:24:40.147
Go on.

245
00:24:41.725 --> 00:24:42.851
Mitsu...

246
00:24:48.398 --> 00:24:54.064
Yoshimura-sensei had to
struggle to keep up appearances.


247
00:24:54.237 --> 00:24:58.469
It was all he could do
to keep his family fed.


248
00:24:59.042 --> 00:25:02.375
But to my eyes at least...

249
00:25:03.146 --> 00:25:06.513
...they seemed happy.

250
00:25:08.485 --> 00:25:12.546
But then, to everyone's surprise,
he left the clan...


251
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:16.125
...leaving his family behind.

252
00:25:17.694 --> 00:25:22.290
In those days leaving one's clan
was practically treason.


253
00:25:22.699 --> 00:25:27.068
But what really shocked me
was that a man...


254
00:25:27.237 --> 00:25:31.697
...who preached the virtues
of Nanbu samurai...


255
00:25:31.908 --> 00:25:34.502
...and was so proud
of the beauty of his land...


256
00:25:34.611 --> 00:25:37.444
...would abandon it.

257
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:43.481
Your old man's a traitor!

258
00:25:48.325 --> 00:25:49.758
A disgrace!

259
00:25:50.794 --> 00:25:52.557
He should die!

260
00:25:53.864 --> 00:25:57.960
A real samurai apologizes
by spilling his guts!


261
00:25:58.368 --> 00:26:00.063
Hara-kiri!

262
00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:01.102
Stop!

263
00:26:10.047 --> 00:26:11.036
I will speak.

264
00:26:12.582 --> 00:26:18.452
Yoshimura-sensei served
my father, Jiroemon Ono.


265
00:26:19.556 --> 00:26:22.389
The sin of an underling
is the sin of his master.


266
00:26:26.196 --> 00:26:31.190
lf Kaichiro has to
kill himself, so do I.

267
00:26:32.369 --> 00:26:34.030
Is that your wish?

268
00:26:36.606 --> 00:26:37.630
Come on.

269
00:26:44.614 --> 00:26:46.104
Are you all right?

270
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:52.244
I'm sorry you had to do that for me,
Squire Chiaki.


271
00:26:55.425 --> 00:27:00.055
I couldn't stand to see
Kaichiro lose heart that way.


272
00:27:01.431 --> 00:27:05.868
Starting with Kaichiro,
the rest of the family...


273
00:27:05.969 --> 00:27:12.101
...were driven from the clan's domain
to seek refuge with relatives.


274
00:27:15.579 --> 00:27:18.605
Wind chimes!

275
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:22.776
Wind chimes for sale!

276
00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.419
Well done.

277
00:27:26.056 --> 00:27:28.490
Kanichiro Yoshimura!

278
00:27:30.293 --> 00:27:30.884
Sir!

279
00:27:31.128 --> 00:27:33.028
2 ryo, 3 bu, 3 shu.

280
00:27:43.039 --> 00:27:44.563
Well done.

281
00:27:45.142 --> 00:27:46.973
My humble thanks.

282
00:27:55.418 --> 00:27:57.716
Next!

283
00:27:58.155 --> 00:28:00.316
Tatsunosuke Nishimura!

284
00:28:00.423 --> 00:28:01.549
Thank you!

285
00:28:05.128 --> 00:28:06.959
2 ryo, 1 bu, 2 shu.

286
00:28:30.554 --> 00:28:31.578
Hello!

287
00:28:32.989 --> 00:28:34.388
Hello again!

288
00:28:35.058 --> 00:28:37.959
Could you send this, please?

289
00:28:38.261 --> 00:28:39.956
Certainly.

290
00:28:44.201 --> 00:28:47.534
Mr. Yoshimura...
here's a letter for you.


291
00:28:47.637 --> 00:28:50.299
My humble thanks!

292
00:28:50.507 --> 00:28:53.476
I'll write you a receipt.

293
00:29:03.286 --> 00:29:05.846
'Dear Father...

294
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:10.553
'I have read your letter...

295
00:29:10.961 --> 00:29:15.125
'...and it is wonderful to hear
that you are well.


296
00:29:17.434 --> 00:29:21.427
'Mother and Mitsu are
in good health...


297
00:29:21.538 --> 00:29:26.498
'...and Keijiro is learning both
to speak and to make mischief.


298
00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:30.737
'I am helping in the fields...

299
00:29:30.914 --> 00:29:33.405
'...and continuing to practice
with my sword.


300
00:29:35.018 --> 00:29:41.082
'Mitsu sometimes calls out
"Papa" in her sleep.


301
00:29:42.759 --> 00:29:50.291
'I would like to come to Kyoto
and serve with you as a samurai.


302
00:29:52.736 --> 00:29:58.800
'I will take care of our family,
so please do not be uneasy.'


303
00:29:58.909 --> 00:30:00.638
Alms!

304
00:30:02.812 --> 00:30:04.575
Alms!

305
00:30:06.716 --> 00:30:10.777
Please, sir! Alms for the poor!

306
00:30:13.857 --> 00:30:20.490
For several years Morioka
had suffered a harsh famine.


307
00:30:21.965 --> 00:30:25.560
Just as I was
getting worried about Kaichiro...


308
00:30:25.869 --> 00:30:29.771
...who should I run into
after some time but the man himself.


309
00:30:44.354 --> 00:30:49.587
'Dear Shizu, Kaichiro, Mitsu
and Keijiro...


310
00:30:51.261 --> 00:30:53.388
'Are you well?'

311
00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:55.290
Kaichiro!

312
00:31:03.807 --> 00:31:05.172
I'm sorry...

313
00:31:06.276 --> 00:31:08.005
...Squire Chiaki!

314
00:31:09.713 --> 00:31:14.013
Please!
You don't have to bow to me!


315
00:31:14.985 --> 00:31:16.350
We're friends!

316
00:31:17.354 --> 00:31:18.878
Forgive me!

317
00:31:19.622 --> 00:31:21.055
Kaichiro!

318
00:31:22.125 --> 00:31:22.853
Kaichiro!

319
00:31:29.532 --> 00:31:30.999
I see...

320
00:31:32.068 --> 00:31:35.333
That's how Kanichiro's supporting
his family?


321
00:31:36.039 --> 00:31:40.271
Why was Yoshimura-sensei
driven from the clan?


322
00:31:41.845 --> 00:31:45.281
Surely you could have
done something, Father.


323
00:31:46.249 --> 00:31:50.618
I cannot act out of personal feeling.

324
00:31:50.954 --> 00:31:54.481
A man who leaves his clan
does not merit our concern.


325
00:31:55.425 --> 00:31:58.258
We suffered a serious loss of face.

326
00:32:05.268 --> 00:32:10.729
So the rumor
he's joined the Shinsengumi...


327
00:32:11.441 --> 00:32:13.136
...is true.

328
00:32:15.445 --> 00:32:20.508
My father and Yoshimura-sensei
were born in the same barracks.


329
00:32:20.984 --> 00:32:24.147
His father was
a minor Samurai of Foot.


330
00:32:25.221 --> 00:32:31.160
My father lived there with his mother.

331
00:32:31.961 --> 00:32:36.057
But suddenly a gap opened up
in their relative status.


332
00:32:48.378 --> 00:32:51.575
The Ono family's son took sick
and died.


333
00:32:52.115 --> 00:32:57.382
My father, the son of old Ono's
concubine, was adopted as heir...


334
00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:00.987
...to a 400-koku stipend.

335
00:33:01.825 --> 00:33:06.728
It is with deepest gratitude
I enter the House of Ono.


336
00:33:07.263 --> 00:33:10.323
Though I am of humble birth...

337
00:33:10.433 --> 00:33:12.697
As a concubine's son...

338
00:33:13.369 --> 00:33:17.772
...he was in no position to go against
the head of the family.


339
00:33:18.208 --> 00:33:23.805
He probably struggled to learn
to suppress all his own feelings.


340
00:33:25.381 --> 00:33:29.283
Despite, or perhaps because of,
their change in status...


341
00:33:29.752 --> 00:33:36.658
...the only one he could talk to
was Yoshimura-sensei.


342
00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.659
However...

343
00:33:39.395 --> 00:33:40.453
Leave the clan?!

344
00:33:41.598 --> 00:33:42.758
Yes.

345
00:33:44.501 --> 00:33:50.064
I hear of great changes taking place.
I cannot resist my nation's call...


346
00:33:50.707 --> 00:33:56.771
...to revere the emperor, expel
the barbarians, and defend the Shogun.


347
00:33:57.247 --> 00:34:03.277
Do you really expect me
to believe that?


348
00:34:04.921 --> 00:34:10.757
I know it's hard on a tiny stipend
when the crops keep failing.


349
00:34:11.628 --> 00:34:13.562
But Kanichiro...

350
00:34:14.531 --> 00:34:17.557
...don't do something stupid
like leaving the clan.


351
00:34:20.537 --> 00:34:24.701
What will I do without you?

352
00:34:25.942 --> 00:34:30.504
My resolve will not be shaken.

353
00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.839
Why, Kanichiro?

354
00:34:33.917 --> 00:34:37.717
Haven't we been friends
all our lives?


355
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:48.156
Please...

356
00:34:50.133 --> 00:34:51.566
I'm truly sorry.

357
00:34:54.504 --> 00:35:00.033
Fool! Leaving your clan is a crime!
I won't stand for it!


358
00:35:03.513 --> 00:35:08.348
So said my father.
It was only later I found out...


359
00:35:08.451 --> 00:35:11.648
...he'd secretly given Yoshimura-sensei
a letter of credit...


360
00:35:11.854 --> 00:35:13.412
...for his journey.

361
00:35:24.767 --> 00:35:26.530
Why...

362
00:35:28.538 --> 00:35:31.905
...do you have that photograph?

363
00:35:34.944 --> 00:35:37.936
If it's not your father...

364
00:35:41.851 --> 00:35:47.687
That gentleman was
a friend of my father...


365
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:52.784
...or to be more precise,
the father of my friend.


366
00:35:55.732 --> 00:35:59.099
He'd be about your age.

367
00:36:00.737 --> 00:36:04.935
Would you have ever heard of
the Shinsengumi?


368
00:36:06.142 --> 00:36:07.803
Well...

369
00:36:11.314 --> 00:36:16.377
They were very powerful,
weren't they.


370
00:36:18.888 --> 00:36:23.916
They were no use in the new era.

371
00:36:30.667 --> 00:36:33.602
Grandpa! I'm going home.

372
00:36:34.404 --> 00:36:37.601
Be a good boy
and do as the doctor says!


373
00:36:38.207 --> 00:36:41.938
If you don't do as she says,
you won't get better.


374
00:36:46.382 --> 00:36:49.408
Are you getting things cleaned up?

375
00:36:50.119 --> 00:36:51.347
I was just starting.

376
00:36:51.454 --> 00:36:54.184
What'll I do with you!

377
00:36:59.562 --> 00:37:00.153
Now.

378
00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:10.335
We are the Shinsengumi!
We have business here!


379
00:39:25.875 --> 00:39:27.206
Die!

380
00:39:41.657 --> 00:39:42.851
One of your men.

381
00:39:42.959 --> 00:39:45.120
What? Who?

382
00:39:50.566 --> 00:39:51.999
He died instantly.

383
00:39:52.835 --> 00:39:56.862
Sanjuro Tani? Who killed him?

384
00:39:57.273 --> 00:39:59.138
I don't know.

385
00:40:00.076 --> 00:40:04.308
He was found this morning
in front of Gion Shrine.


386
00:40:06.182 --> 00:40:07.410
Tani?

387
00:40:07.984 --> 00:40:11.476
He'd been getting above himself.

388
00:40:12.121 --> 00:40:14.851
The other men didn't like it.

389
00:40:18.728 --> 00:40:22.926
You're saying one of us did it?

390
00:40:23.099 --> 00:40:25.226
We're investigating.

391
00:40:46.822 --> 00:40:48.517
Murderer!

392
00:40:50.927 --> 00:40:52.087
Stop it!

393
00:40:52.395 --> 00:40:53.521
You did this!

394
00:40:55.231 --> 00:40:58.530
I will not allow serving the Shogun
to be called murder.


395
00:40:58.701 --> 00:41:00.100
What?!

396
00:41:01.203 --> 00:41:02.693
Shuhei!

397
00:41:09.245 --> 00:41:14.808
Saito-sensei... there's something
I'd like to ask you.


398
00:41:15.451 --> 00:41:16.782
Would you mind?

399
00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:25.827
A brilliantly executed cut
to the chest.


400
00:41:26.896 --> 00:41:29.990
The cut begins on the left.

401
00:41:30.933 --> 00:41:32.696
And one more thing.

402
00:41:39.609 --> 00:41:43.010
One stab from left of the spine
to the heart.


403
00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:48.478
Mr. Shinohara deduces
there were two culprits.


404
00:41:48.584 --> 00:41:50.108
A two-man job...

405
00:41:50.219 --> 00:41:55.885
No. I believe
the assailant acted alone.


406
00:41:57.193 --> 00:42:00.685
After the body cut,
but before he fell...


407
00:42:00.796 --> 00:42:03.492
...he was finished off with a stab.

408
00:42:05.735 --> 00:42:07.726
A deft swordsman, then.

409
00:42:08.204 --> 00:42:13.938
I've always heard that
left-handed men were quite deft.


410
00:42:15.177 --> 00:42:20.638
To stab, one turns the sword
on its side...


411
00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:22.781
...like this.

412
00:42:26.522 --> 00:42:28.353
From the right...

413
00:42:32.962 --> 00:42:34.486
...the wound doesn't match.

414
00:42:36.832 --> 00:42:38.163
But...

415
00:42:40.903 --> 00:42:42.837
...from the left hand...

416
00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.247
Even so...

417
00:42:55.284 --> 00:42:58.344
...it was most skillfully done.

418
00:42:58.688 --> 00:43:01.384
Simply brilliant.

419
00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:06.890
But our rules...

420
00:43:08.764 --> 00:43:11.699
...strictly forbid private vendettas...

421
00:43:14.603 --> 00:43:16.400
...Saito-sensei.

422
00:43:19.875 --> 00:43:24.244
And have you mentioned
these conclusions to anyone?


423
00:43:25.314 --> 00:43:26.474
No.

424
00:43:34.056 --> 00:43:38.493
Do you draw against me, sir?

425
00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:46.358
The Shinsengumi,
this death-seeking rabble...


426
00:43:47.169 --> 00:43:50.229
...suits me somehow.

427
00:43:51.507 --> 00:43:53.441
Keep out of my way.

428
00:43:54.744 --> 00:43:56.939
Well, then...

429
00:44:01.183 --> 00:44:05.711
...will you give me some money...

430
00:44:07.323 --> 00:44:10.554
...to keep my mouth closed?

431
00:44:21.937 --> 00:44:23.871
Why do walk on that side?

432
00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:29.341
I'm afraid of your left arm,
Saito-sensei.


433
00:44:29.445 --> 00:44:31.003
I won't draw on you.

434
00:44:35.618 --> 00:44:37.051
Does this...

435
00:44:38.854 --> 00:44:41.049
...mean us?

436
00:44:42.491 --> 00:44:44.083
Are we...

437
00:44:46.929 --> 00:44:48.521
...'the wolves of Mibu'?

438
00:44:57.339 --> 00:44:59.136
My humble thanks.

439
00:45:02.278 --> 00:45:05.042
I don't want your thanks.

440
00:45:23.732 --> 00:45:25.461
Welcome.

441
00:45:28.103 --> 00:45:29.934
I'm sorry to disturb you.

442
00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:37.476
Not much to look at, huh?

443
00:45:57.099 --> 00:45:58.760
Please.

444
00:45:59.501 --> 00:46:02.299
Well! Thank you.

445
00:46:02.938 --> 00:46:09.070
I don"t like beautiful women.
Women called 'beautiful' disgust me.


446
00:46:09.745 --> 00:46:13.806
After all, none of us is
more than a sack of shit.


447
00:46:40.976 --> 00:46:43.274
They be so pretty!

448
00:46:57.126 --> 00:46:58.593
I'm truly sorry!

449
00:46:59.628 --> 00:47:04.122
Your accent makes me think
you're from Oshu...


450
00:47:12.908 --> 00:47:17.641
I worked all over the north.

451
00:47:19.715 --> 00:47:24.709
Then I was sold to a brothel
in Shimabara, here in Kyoto.


452
00:47:25.921 --> 00:47:29.220
I see...

453
00:47:30.059 --> 00:47:31.492
I didn't know that.

454
00:47:33.662 --> 00:47:36.688
'The boss' here doesn't like
people talking too much.


455
00:47:36.799 --> 00:47:42.829
You can't talk too much
about your home town.


456
00:48:18.507 --> 00:48:20.907
She's beautiful!

457
00:48:50.272 --> 00:48:53.673
I'm getting married...
to a girl from near here.


458
00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:57.678
You are?

459
00:48:59.248 --> 00:49:00.875
Who is it?

460
00:49:02.184 --> 00:49:06.678
Shizu, the girl at the summer festival
we were looking at.


461
00:49:09.925 --> 00:49:11.187
Shizu?

462
00:49:12.928 --> 00:49:15.226
I fell in love at first sight.

463
00:49:17.766 --> 00:49:19.791
You did, eh?

464
00:49:24.106 --> 00:49:25.835
I see...

465
00:49:26.108 --> 00:49:26.870
Fool!

466
00:49:28.277 --> 00:49:29.710
Do you mock me?!

467
00:49:30.112 --> 00:49:32.046
A farmer's daughter?!

468
00:49:32.381 --> 00:49:34.246
If a samurai family adopted her...

469
00:49:34.349 --> 00:49:36.681
Make her a concubine, if you like.

470
00:49:37.352 --> 00:49:42.790
You can keep her until
you make a proper marriage.


471
00:49:43.092 --> 00:49:45.117
That we will permit.

472
00:49:50.432 --> 00:49:52.957
Please stop!

473
00:49:56.538 --> 00:50:00.872
What is it, Miss?
Do you need to relieve yourself?


474
00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:22.822
Hey!

475
00:50:26.068 --> 00:50:28.730
You stay here!

476
00:50:30.739 --> 00:50:31.637
Hey!

477
00:50:50.359 --> 00:50:51.849
Kanichiro!

478
00:50:53.896 --> 00:50:55.227
Shizu!

479
00:51:04.239 --> 00:51:05.501
What are you doing here?

480
00:51:08.477 --> 00:51:12.607
This is where I want to be!

481
00:51:14.149 --> 00:51:19.712
I want to marry you!

482
00:51:21.256 --> 00:51:22.621
Shizu!

483
00:51:24.593 --> 00:51:26.060
Kanichiro!

484
00:51:26.862 --> 00:51:28.295
Shizu...

485
00:51:33.035 --> 00:51:36.402
Give the girl back, please.

486
00:51:39.174 --> 00:51:40.641
Shizu...

487
00:51:43.011 --> 00:51:45.002
...will be my wife!

488
00:51:45.514 --> 00:51:48.005
Jiroemon won't have her!
Go tell him that, Sasuke!


489
00:51:49.785 --> 00:51:51.218
You can't do that!

490
00:51:53.388 --> 00:51:54.787
From this day on...

491
00:51:56.391 --> 00:51:58.256
...you are my wife.

492
00:52:00.529 --> 00:52:05.023
I won't let anyone lay
a finger on you!


493
00:52:09.438 --> 00:52:10.803
Shizu!

494
00:52:11.673 --> 00:52:13.038
Kanichiro!

495
00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:22.808
I have received
unofficial notification from Edo.


496
00:52:23.919 --> 00:52:29.084
We of the Shinsengumi are to be made
direct retainers of the Shogun himself!


497
00:52:34.429 --> 00:52:36.863
We must look to our task.

498
00:52:38.133 --> 00:52:41.102
We must preserve
the authority of the Shogun...


499
00:52:41.903 --> 00:52:43.632
...and his Tokugawa family!

500
00:52:53.015 --> 00:52:54.607
Kondo-sensei...

501
00:52:55.817 --> 00:53:00.447
You say that we are
to be made hatamoto?


502
00:53:00.555 --> 00:53:01.817
Is this true?

503
00:53:02.924 --> 00:53:03.549
Yes.

504
00:53:04.693 --> 00:53:09.062
Yoshimura...
does this displease you?


505
00:53:09.931 --> 00:53:11.262
No!

506
00:53:12.401 --> 00:53:13.629
No.

507
00:53:14.102 --> 00:53:15.729
Not at all.

508
00:53:18.573 --> 00:53:23.704
Um... may I ask a foolish question?

509
00:53:25.814 --> 00:53:29.477
Will we receive payment
appropriate to this honor?


510
00:53:30.719 --> 00:53:31.651
Payment?!

511
00:53:39.561 --> 00:53:45.261
'All personnel to rank as "Inspector".'
You will earn 40 bags of rice.


512
00:53:46.435 --> 00:53:47.902
Forty?!

513
00:53:48.136 --> 00:53:50.331
Yes. Forty.

514
00:53:55.243 --> 00:53:57.268
Thank you!

515
00:53:59.581 --> 00:54:04.450
Kondo-sensei, thank you
from the bottom of my heart!


516
00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:08.148
Ito-sensei, Hijikata-sensei...

517
00:54:08.256 --> 00:54:10.656
...thank you very much!

518
00:54:12.194 --> 00:54:16.654
Everybody... I thank you...

519
00:54:16.965 --> 00:54:18.398
...with all my heart!

520
00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:21.928
My humble thanks, too,
Yoshimura-sensei!


521
00:54:29.244 --> 00:54:30.302
Saito-sensei...

522
00:54:34.249 --> 00:54:36.080
...my humble thanks!

523
00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:03.637
The gentleman in the middle...
don't move. Stay still.


524
00:55:04.012 --> 00:55:05.502
Hold your breath!

525
00:55:06.615 --> 00:55:09.709
One, two, three...

526
00:55:09.951 --> 00:55:13.887
...four, five, six, seven...

527
00:55:14.356 --> 00:55:17.120
...eight, nine, ten.

528
00:55:17.359 --> 00:55:20.419
Well done. That's it.

529
00:55:20.829 --> 00:55:23.354
Who's next for a photograph?

530
00:55:24.132 --> 00:55:25.121
Yoshimura!

531
00:55:26.268 --> 00:55:26.757
Yes?

532
00:55:27.002 --> 00:55:30.233
Have a picture taken.
They'll love it back home.


533
00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:34.566
No, no, thank you.

534
00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:38.636
Don't worry. We'll pay for it.

535
00:55:40.348 --> 00:55:43.715
Well, if you say so...

536
00:55:46.221 --> 00:55:48.712
What, only me?

537
00:55:48.824 --> 00:55:50.917
Gentlemen!

538
00:55:51.026 --> 00:55:52.118
Just you.

539
00:55:52.861 --> 00:55:54.852
Kondo-sensei! Saito-sensei!

540
00:55:54.963 --> 00:55:55.827
Like this.

541
00:55:56.231 --> 00:55:59.029
Stand still. Just bear with it.

542
00:55:59.134 --> 00:56:00.431
Don't move!

543
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:02.903
Hold your breath.

544
00:56:04.206 --> 00:56:07.334
One, two, three...

545
00:56:23.425 --> 00:56:26.861
Where are you moving to?

546
00:56:27.696 --> 00:56:29.323
Manchuria.

547
00:56:29.564 --> 00:56:33.625
China? That's a long way away.

548
00:56:33.735 --> 00:56:34.861
Yes.

549
00:56:51.353 --> 00:56:56.120
By this time the Shinsengumi
had split into two factions.


550
00:56:56.625 --> 00:57:01.961
So had Japan, as the Shogun's forces
fought the southwestern clans...


551
00:57:02.197 --> 00:57:04.722
...who wished the Emperor to rule.

552
00:57:05.433 --> 00:57:08.698
This was a tide
the Shinsengumi could not resist.


553
00:57:08.803 --> 00:57:09.929
Yoshimura!

554
00:57:10.138 --> 00:57:11.127
Yes?

555
00:57:12.073 --> 00:57:16.009
Could I ask for some of
your time tonight? It's important.


556
00:57:16.912 --> 00:57:18.880
Certainly.

557
00:57:24.819 --> 00:57:27.287
This is fine. Leave us.

558
00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:37.824
Our task is to guard the Court.
Our loyalty lays with the Emperor.


559
00:57:40.435 --> 00:57:45.964
Under Squire Kondo we are no more
than the Tokugawa Shogun's dogs.


560
00:57:48.176 --> 00:57:53.842
In this time of upheaval in the land,
I cannot but think that is a mistake.


561
00:57:55.617 --> 00:58:00.020
We thus take leave of the Shinsengumi.

562
00:58:01.356 --> 00:58:03.551
I wasn't surprised.

563
00:58:04.426 --> 00:58:08.590
A fox thinks for itself,
while a dog simply follows.


564
00:58:08.863 --> 00:58:12.264
We want you with us!

565
00:58:12.601 --> 00:58:15.570
We need your swords!

566
00:58:16.338 --> 00:58:19.637
We'll be appointed Imperial Guards.

567
00:58:20.175 --> 00:58:24.703
We promise you twice what you get
as Shogun's hatamoto.


568
00:58:25.981 --> 00:58:29.781
We're not asking you to decide now.

569
00:58:34.255 --> 00:58:40.421
By leaving my clan,
I have already failed one lord.


570
00:58:40.528 --> 00:58:44.794
I will not betray the trust of another.

571
00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:47.898
Yoshimura... Mr. Saito...

572
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:52.772
...as I see it,
the Tokugawa Shogunate is dead.


573
00:58:53.208 --> 00:58:57.736
Others have left... Katsura, from Choshu,
and Sakamoto, from Tosa...


574
00:58:57.912 --> 00:58:59.004
No!

575
00:59:01.883 --> 00:59:03.680
I cannot.

576
00:59:05.487 --> 00:59:08.650
Yoshimura! Think of the future!

577
00:59:09.057 --> 00:59:14.723
I was surprised, too, that money
would not sway Yoshimura.


578
00:59:15.497 --> 00:59:17.556
You're not fit to be samurai!

579
00:59:17.666 --> 00:59:19.258
You have an obligation!

580
00:59:19.367 --> 00:59:20.732
You're a disgrace!

581
00:59:20.835 --> 00:59:22.029
Mr. Shinohara!

582
00:59:23.104 --> 00:59:24.901
Get out of Kyoto!

583
00:59:26.508 --> 00:59:29.534
I decided to go with Ito...

584
00:59:31.513 --> 00:59:35.882
...but as an informer
for Kondo and Hljikata.


585
00:59:36.985 --> 00:59:42.218
Squire Okubo, we must remove
those who are disloyal...


586
00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:43.955
...to the Emperor.

587
00:59:44.993 --> 00:59:50.556
Indeed. Those who can't see
where the times are headed...


588
00:59:51.466 --> 00:59:53.491
...are in our way.

589
00:59:55.737 --> 01:00:00.436
Without Kondo and Hijikata,
the Shinsengumi will collapse.


590
01:00:01.876 --> 01:00:06.245
That's easy to say, Mr. Ito.

591
01:00:08.183 --> 01:00:09.548
Unless...

592
01:00:11.786 --> 01:00:13.219
...Mr. Saito helps.

593
01:00:23.865 --> 01:00:26.732
They were counting on me.

594
01:00:27.235 --> 01:00:30.864
Ito was a fox. So was Okubo,
of Satsuma, in the southwest.


595
01:00:31.473 --> 01:00:35.102
They knew a wolf
when they saw one.


596
01:00:35.677 --> 01:00:39.306
'I wear a family crest...

597
01:00:39.414 --> 01:00:43.043
'Mother often speaks in jest...

598
01:00:43.251 --> 01:00:46.482
'And Father da-dum da-dum...

599
01:00:46.755 --> 01:00:50.350
'Elder Sister makes eyes at the guest...

600
01:00:50.458 --> 01:00:54.394
'...and Little Sister...

601
01:00:54.496 --> 01:00:58.296
'...is being a pest.'

602
01:01:13.882 --> 01:01:15.213
Be careful.

603
01:01:20.855 --> 01:01:22.288
Hey 'Boss'...

604
01:01:43.478 --> 01:01:49.144
It was Yoshimura's job
to pass my messages to Hijikata.


605
01:01:49.651 --> 01:01:51.448
That was ironic.

606
01:01:52.554 --> 01:01:57.651
I'm sorry a woman has to do
such dangerous work.


607
01:01:58.193 --> 01:02:04.393
It doesn't frighten me at all.
I'm happy to do it.


608
01:02:09.304 --> 01:02:14.799
Have some of these dumplings.
I love them.


609
01:02:15.243 --> 01:02:16.733
Well! So do I!

610
01:02:16.845 --> 01:02:18.938
That's good.

611
01:02:19.113 --> 01:02:20.740
Thank you.

612
01:02:22.884 --> 01:02:27.844
Just the thought that a woman
like me can help...


613
01:02:28.022 --> 01:02:32.220
...makes me feel strong inside.

614
01:02:39.834 --> 01:02:44.237
When we first met in Shimabara
he came back the next day...


615
01:02:44.339 --> 01:02:48.435
...and bought out
my contract from the brothel.


616
01:02:50.778 --> 01:02:56.182
I'm proud when he says
I'm not much to look at.


617
01:03:00.755 --> 01:03:06.387
My family all starved in the famine.

618
01:03:07.528 --> 01:03:11.191
He's the only one
who's ever stood by me.


619
01:03:13.167 --> 01:03:15.829
He took pity on me.

620
01:03:17.438 --> 01:03:19.099
He did, eh?

621
01:03:20.775 --> 01:03:21.799
Have some.

622
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:24.276
l'm fine, thanks.

623
01:03:26.881 --> 01:03:29.475
I passed on Ito's plot...

624
01:03:30.218 --> 01:03:35.884
...to kill Kondo, and even Ryoma Sakamoto,
who was against using force...


625
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:38.015
...to topple the Shogun.

626
01:03:44.132 --> 01:03:45.599
Very interesting.

627
01:03:51.706 --> 01:03:53.173
Kill Ito.

628
01:04:05.853 --> 01:04:11.814
Of course I couldn't kill Kondo,
so I killed their other target.


629
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:18.055
Welcome home.

630
01:04:22.503 --> 01:04:26.872
Keep away from the Shinsengumi.
Don't see Yoshimura again.


631
01:04:28.743 --> 01:04:30.768
I've got to hide out.

632
01:04:31.245 --> 01:04:33.372
You get out of here, too.

633
01:04:38.619 --> 01:04:41.588
Why do I have to go?

634
01:04:43.591 --> 01:04:48.722
I've taken a big chance.
I'll be lucky to come out alive.


635
01:04:49.664 --> 01:04:53.725
If you're with me,
they'll come after you, too.


636
01:04:54.535 --> 01:04:55.763
This...

637
01:04:57.138 --> 01:04:58.833
...is a farewell gift.

638
01:05:00.408 --> 01:05:03.206
I don't care. I'm staying.

639
01:05:03.311 --> 01:05:05.279
I don't want you getting killed!

640
01:05:08.783 --> 01:05:10.080
Goodbye.

641
01:05:13.254 --> 01:05:17.452
I don't want this.

642
01:05:20.695 --> 01:05:22.060
Think of yourself!

643
01:05:28.469 --> 01:05:33.839
I understand perfectly
what you're saying.


644
01:05:36.210 --> 01:05:40.203
But I don't need anything from you.

645
01:05:43.551 --> 01:05:45.018
Instead...

646
01:05:46.487 --> 01:05:48.216
...tonight...

647
01:05:49.991 --> 01:05:51.822
...make love to me.

648
01:06:04.572 --> 01:06:05.869
Hold me...

649
01:06:07.375 --> 01:06:09.036
...please.

650
01:06:53.754 --> 01:06:54.812
What happened?

651
01:06:54.922 --> 01:06:56.719
Ryoma Sakamoto's been killed!

652
01:06:56.824 --> 01:06:57.916
What?

653
01:06:58.693 --> 01:07:03.096
I wasn't excited about
who had assassinated Ryoma.


654
01:07:03.931 --> 01:07:07.867
Better than anyone, 
I knew who had.

655
01:07:31.325 --> 01:07:32.986
Hello?

656
01:07:34.128 --> 01:07:35.390
Miss Nui?

657
01:07:38.399 --> 01:07:40.663
May I come in?

658
01:07:47.008 --> 01:07:48.407
Miss Nui?

659
01:08:01.455 --> 01:08:02.353
Miss...

660
01:08:11.966 --> 01:08:13.297
Miss Nui!

661
01:08:30.685 --> 01:08:31.652
Shizu!

662
01:08:33.187 --> 01:08:34.176
Shizu!

663
01:08:49.704 --> 01:08:50.932
Shizu!

664
01:08:59.647 --> 01:09:04.311
A samurai's wife can't kill herself
so there's one less mouth to feed!


665
01:09:04.652 --> 01:09:06.244
Let me go!

666
01:09:07.488 --> 01:09:08.785
Shizu!

667
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:10.958
Let me die!

668
01:09:11.659 --> 01:09:12.921
Shizu!

669
01:09:14.362 --> 01:09:16.922
Shizu! You can't!

670
01:09:18.199 --> 01:09:20.133
You can't do this!

671
01:09:21.535 --> 01:09:22.729
All right...

672
01:09:24.438 --> 01:09:27.373
...let me die and use me for food!

673
01:09:29.710 --> 01:09:31.109
I can't...

674
01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:35.577
...go on bringing you trouble!

675
01:09:45.893 --> 01:09:47.622
Shizu!

676
01:09:49.563 --> 01:09:52.464
Father!

677
01:09:53.367 --> 01:09:56.097
Don't be angry at Mother!

678
01:09:56.771 --> 01:10:01.902
I'm not hungry! 
I don't need to eat!

679
01:10:08.549 --> 01:10:10.107
I won't...

680
01:10:12.186 --> 01:10:14.848
...let this happen to you again.

681
01:10:17.358 --> 01:10:19.553
I owe my loyalty to you.

682
01:10:23.331 --> 01:10:25.231
And no one else.

683
01:10:30.714 --> 01:10:33.114
As a teacher of children...

684
01:10:30.938 --> 01:10:33.338
As a teacher of children...

685
01:10:34.985 --> 01:10:37.818
...and a fencing instructor...

686
01:10:35.209 --> 01:10:38.042
...and a fencing instructor...

687
01:10:38.956 --> 01:10:45.452
...it's impossible for me to go
begging for money here in Morioka.


688
01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:47.446
...it's impossible for me to go
begging for money here in Morioka.


689
01:10:47.446 --> 01:10:50.973
But I know full well...

690
01:10:53.419 --> 01:10:58.186
...that without money none of you
will live through the winter.


691
01:11:12.037 --> 01:11:13.299
Kaichiro...

692
01:11:15.741 --> 01:11:16.969
Mitsu...

693
01:11:19.311 --> 01:11:20.710
Though I might...

694
01:11:27.653 --> 01:11:30.451
...abandon my clan to earn my living...

695
01:11:32.758 --> 01:11:37.320
...I will never abandon you.

696
01:11:53.579 --> 01:11:54.739
Shizu...

697
01:11:56.648 --> 01:12:00.243
...look after the new baby
when it comes.


698
01:12:05.157 --> 01:12:05.589
Kanichiro...

699
01:12:05.691 --> 01:12:06.885
No!

700
01:12:08.627 --> 01:12:11.619
It has to seem like
I left without telling you.


701
01:12:12.698 --> 01:12:14.996
We can't have words of farewell!

702
01:12:23.308 --> 01:12:24.400
So...

703
01:12:26.111 --> 01:12:27.476
...I'm going.

704
01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:28.942
Kanichiro!

705
01:12:44.129 --> 01:12:46.222
Father! Father!

706
01:12:52.404 --> 01:12:53.735
Father...

707
01:12:55.574 --> 01:12:59.032
Go home! You mustn't see me off!

708
01:13:00.812 --> 01:13:02.541
I won't.

709
01:13:03.515 --> 01:13:07.975
Only just... hold Mitsu one last time.

710
01:13:09.354 --> 01:13:13.188
She doesn't deserve to have
the father she loves...


711
01:13:13.725 --> 01:13:15.283
...go without a word.

712
01:13:24.803 --> 01:13:25.701
Papa...

713
01:13:27.973 --> 01:13:29.406
Papa...

714
01:13:42.754 --> 01:13:44.119
Papa...

715
01:14:13.118 --> 01:14:14.016
Mitsu...

716
01:14:17.689 --> 01:14:19.020
Mitsu...

717
01:14:19.124 --> 01:14:20.523
Papa...

718
01:14:22.127 --> 01:14:23.389
Mitsu...

719
01:14:39.411 --> 01:14:42.869
Father, please don't cry.

720
01:14:46.084 --> 01:14:50.544
I only wish your departure
were a happier one.


721
01:15:29.361 --> 01:15:31.261
Squire Saito returns!

722
01:15:32.230 --> 01:15:33.219
Saito-sensei?

723
01:15:33.332 --> 01:15:34.026
Why?

724
01:15:34.132 --> 01:15:35.156
I don't know.

725
01:15:39.871 --> 01:15:41.236
Squire Saito!

726
01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:43.000
Stand aside!

727
01:15:44.609 --> 01:15:49.979
I was tired of hiding out.
I went back to the Shinsengumi...


728
01:15:50.882 --> 01:15:56.081
...though I knew perfectly well
how bedraggled it had become.


729
01:15:56.521 --> 01:15:59.649
That was all the more reason
for me to return.


730
01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:13.499
My sympathies for
the unpleasant task that fell to you.


731
01:16:13.872 --> 01:16:16.033
I don't need your sympathy.

732
01:16:16.475 --> 01:16:17.635
Move.

733
01:16:22.948 --> 01:16:23.880
Saito-sensei...

734
01:16:32.324 --> 01:16:33.791
Miss Nui...

735
01:16:36.128 --> 01:16:37.755
What about her?

736
01:16:41.533 --> 01:16:43.558
She killed herself.

737
01:16:59.518 --> 01:17:00.815
I see.

738
01:17:02.354 --> 01:17:08.350
I took the liberty of arranging
a funeral at Koenji Temple.


739
01:17:10.996 --> 01:17:12.759
Mind your own business.

740
01:17:16.268 --> 01:17:20.830
Right then only he knew...

741
01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:23.474
...my innermost thoughts.

742
01:18:59.571 --> 01:19:01.198
You're going to kill me?

743
01:19:02.874 --> 01:19:06.503
A country samurai
who doesn't care what happens?


744
01:19:08.146 --> 01:19:11.013
Doesn't anything matter
as long as you get paid?


745
01:19:12.284 --> 01:19:14.184
Money-grubber!

746
01:19:16.521 --> 01:19:18.045
Mercenary!

747
01:19:19.558 --> 01:19:21.651
How much are they paying you
to kill me?!


748
01:19:50.088 --> 01:19:52.022
I'm truly sorry.

749
01:20:50.949 --> 01:20:52.439
It was all...

750
01:20:53.385 --> 01:20:55.546
...downhill from there.

751
01:20:56.588 --> 01:21:00.888
The Shogun resigned, and political
power returned to the Emperor.


752
01:21:00.992 --> 01:21:02.755
The Lord of Aizu,
Commissioner of Kyoto...


753
01:21:03.862 --> 01:21:08.925
...was relieved of his post,
leaving us with nothing to guard.


754
01:21:10.201 --> 01:21:12.396
Okita was dying of tuberculosis...

755
01:21:12.671 --> 01:21:18.007
...and Shinohara, of the Ito faction,
had shot Kondo.


756
01:21:19.377 --> 01:21:25.145
As if seeking its last stand,
the Shinsengumi joined in the fight...


757
01:21:25.517 --> 01:21:28.509
...against the southwestern clans.

758
01:21:29.421 --> 01:21:33.790
Fighting was all we could do.

759
01:21:36.094 --> 01:21:37.254
Squire Ono...

760
01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:51.876
Straighten your backs!
Stick out your chests!


761
01:21:52.477 --> 01:21:55.105
We are the warriors of Mibu!

762
01:22:05.290 --> 01:22:06.951
Shinsengumi!

763
01:22:14.165 --> 01:22:15.632
Good on you!

764
01:22:18.403 --> 01:22:19.734
Shinsengumi!

765
01:22:20.572 --> 01:22:22.802
Are you properly dressed?

766
01:22:23.975 --> 01:22:27.706
If your clothing isn't good and tight,
you will die!


767
01:22:30.315 --> 01:22:34.251
Even if you fall,
do not drop your sword!


768
01:22:35.019 --> 01:22:37.044
Keep swinging it!

769
01:22:38.490 --> 01:22:43.518
If you're out of breath,
grab your opponent.


770
01:22:45.130 --> 01:22:49.066
Use any means you can...

771
01:22:50.368 --> 01:22:52.199
...and come back alive.

772
01:22:59.811 --> 01:23:00.800
They're coming!

773
01:23:00.912 --> 01:23:03.642
The Shinsengumi's here!

774
01:23:06.117 --> 01:23:07.482
Charge!

775
01:23:08.953 --> 01:23:10.079
Fire!

776
01:23:14.526 --> 01:23:15.959
Forward!

777
01:23:18.496 --> 01:23:19.656
Fire!

778
01:23:27.172 --> 01:23:32.872
It was ludicrous. Swords against guns,
a foregone conclusion.


779
01:23:33.812 --> 01:23:36.645
The day of the sword...

780
01:23:37.215 --> 01:23:40.048
...was already far in the past.

781
01:23:42.187 --> 01:23:46.180
Nanbu Clan godown, Osaka

782
01:23:47.492 --> 01:23:48.789
Reporting!

783
01:23:50.962 --> 01:23:56.400
The Shogun's forces are retreating.
The southwestern army...


784
01:23:56.501 --> 01:23:58.264
...is in pursuit.

785
01:23:59.537 --> 01:24:01.664
They're winning?

786
01:24:01.973 --> 01:24:03.065
Yes, sir.

787
01:24:04.209 --> 01:24:06.973
The Shinsengumi's no help?

788
01:24:08.479 --> 01:24:09.605
'Shinsengumi'?

789
01:24:12.450 --> 01:24:13.576
Nothing.

790
01:24:19.591 --> 01:24:22.492
We fled with the Shogun's troops.

791
01:24:23.094 --> 01:24:25.119
The other clans deserted us.

792
01:24:25.630 --> 01:24:32.092
On the edge of annihilation,
we played our final card.


793
01:24:33.805 --> 01:24:35.363
You all right?

794
01:24:37.108 --> 01:24:38.973
Have some food.

795
01:24:41.312 --> 01:24:43.746
Go on, eat.

796
01:24:48.853 --> 01:24:51.014
Eat slowly!

797
01:24:53.391 --> 01:24:54.949
Saito-sensei...

798
01:25:00.698 --> 01:25:05.829
I got the Aizu people
to share their supplies with us.


799
01:25:07.972 --> 01:25:09.030
Please...

800
01:25:26.190 --> 01:25:28.488
Have you eaten?

801
01:25:29.427 --> 01:25:30.792
Uh...

802
01:25:31.663 --> 01:25:32.823
...no.

803
01:25:35.934 --> 01:25:37.060
Was that the last?

804
01:25:41.205 --> 01:25:46.040
Why didn't you say?!
You let me eat the last one!


805
01:25:46.978 --> 01:25:50.175
I'm used to being hungry.

806
01:25:50.581 --> 01:25:54.039
This'll do me fine.

807
01:25:57.822 --> 01:25:59.187
You bastard!

808
01:26:00.325 --> 01:26:03.726
I hate your guts!

809
01:26:04.395 --> 01:26:07.660
Why should one shit-sack care
if another's full?!


810
01:26:07.999 --> 01:26:11.662
In a world where men hate enough
to kill each other...


811
01:26:12.036 --> 01:26:15.437
...why are you trying
to fill my stomach?!


812
01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:17.701
Saito-sensei!

813
01:26:17.809 --> 01:26:20.209
I can't breathe!

814
01:26:30.121 --> 01:26:33.488
Yoshimura... get out of here.

815
01:26:36.627 --> 01:26:38.652
We're going to die here...

816
01:26:39.797 --> 01:26:42.459
...whether we like it or not.

817
01:26:44.369 --> 01:26:48.362
But I don't want you to.

818
01:26:49.674 --> 01:26:52.142
Not a man like you.

819
01:27:00.218 --> 01:27:01.310
Mr. Saito...

820
01:27:11.329 --> 01:27:12.694
I am...

821
01:27:14.399 --> 01:27:16.890
...a Nanbu samurai.

822
01:27:28.446 --> 01:27:30.607
A Nanbu samurai...

823
01:27:32.250 --> 01:27:36.653
...lets neither wife nor child
sway him from his duty.


824
01:27:38.956 --> 01:27:44.189
When Nanbu fights,
I will be there first.


825
01:27:47.598 --> 01:27:54.197
I'm truly grateful for
the consideration you've shown me...


826
01:27:56.340 --> 01:28:02.006
...but I will never turn my back
on my duty.


827
01:28:03.281 --> 01:28:04.612
Yoshimura!

828
01:28:12.523 --> 01:28:14.013
Saito-sensei...

829
01:28:16.961 --> 01:28:18.792
...my humble thanks.

830
01:28:23.501 --> 01:28:26.527
He was a true samurai.

831
01:29:05.335 --> 01:29:07.064
The enemy!

832
01:29:13.209 --> 01:29:14.733
We're under attack!

833
01:29:53.716 --> 01:29:56.276
Hold your fire!

834
01:30:01.791 --> 01:30:04.316
Stop shooting!

835
01:30:04.961 --> 01:30:05.825
Swords!

836
01:30:44.367 --> 01:30:46.335
Fight or die!

837
01:30:59.582 --> 01:31:02.380
Cut them down!

838
01:31:14.230 --> 01:31:15.162
Retreat!

839
01:31:15.765 --> 01:31:17.665
Retreat! Retreat!

840
01:31:23.106 --> 01:31:25.904
Forward!

841
01:32:20.563 --> 01:32:22.929
The Emperor's standard!

842
01:32:24.767 --> 01:32:29.864
We are the Imperial Army!
Withdraw your soldiers!


843
01:32:30.573 --> 01:32:35.203
There will be no mercy for rebels!

844
01:32:35.912 --> 01:32:38.608
Are we rebels now?!

845
01:32:41.751 --> 01:32:43.912
Withdraw!

846
01:32:44.254 --> 01:32:47.246
Withdraw!! Don't resist!

847
01:32:47.757 --> 01:32:49.782
Don't resist! Withdraw!

848
01:32:49.892 --> 01:32:52.759
Hijikata-sensei! 
Are we rebels?

849
01:32:54.597 --> 01:32:55.689
Hey!

850
01:32:55.832 --> 01:32:56.821
Stand your ground!

851
01:32:56.933 --> 01:32:59.128
Stay here, I said!

852
01:33:18.788 --> 01:33:22.815
I am Kanichiro Yoshimura
of the Shinsengumi!


853
01:33:23.259 --> 01:33:26.057
I serve the Tokugawa Shogun!

854
01:33:26.929 --> 01:33:31.662
I do not wish to raise my arm
against His Majesty the Emperor...


855
01:33:32.635 --> 01:33:37.072
...but my duty bids me fight!

856
01:33:38.408 --> 01:33:40.069
I stand against you!

857
01:33:49.686 --> 01:33:50.675
Yoshimura!

858
01:33:56.059 --> 01:33:57.492
Don't die!

859
01:34:03.833 --> 01:34:04.561
Yoshimura!

860
01:34:09.072 --> 01:34:10.437
Yoshimura!

861
01:34:12.075 --> 01:34:15.135
Don't die. Yoshimura!

862
01:34:16.846 --> 01:34:18.245
Yoshimura!

863
01:34:19.882 --> 01:34:21.349
Yoshimura!

864
01:34:22.151 --> 01:34:23.778
Yoshimura!

865
01:34:26.322 --> 01:34:27.789
Yoshimura...

866
01:34:39.569 --> 01:34:43.972
So you knew Yoshimura-sensei...

867
01:34:55.785 --> 01:35:01.883
I assume he died at
the Battle of Toba-Fushimi...


868
01:35:05.628 --> 01:35:06.424
No.

869
01:35:08.931 --> 01:35:11.456
What, is he alive?!

870
01:35:18.608 --> 01:35:20.235
After that battle...

871
01:35:20.643 --> 01:35:25.205
...the war went in favor of
the southwestern clans.


872
01:35:26.182 --> 01:35:30.619
My father, Jiroemon Ono...

873
01:35:30.987 --> 01:35:34.616
...had been sent to Osaka...

874
01:35:34.824 --> 01:35:41.024
...as godown manager, to steer
the clan through the crisis.


875
01:35:41.130 --> 01:35:42.097
Leave to speak!

876
01:35:42.765 --> 01:35:44.960
His Lordship the Shogun...

877
01:35:45.067 --> 01:35:50.334
...has fled Osaka Castle,
left his army and taken ship for Edo.


878
01:35:51.007 --> 01:35:55.307
We know who's going to win now.
The way forward is clear!


879
01:35:55.678 --> 01:35:58.977
We can either join the Emperor
and his southwestern clans...


880
01:35:59.081 --> 01:36:01.481
...or be destroyed
with the Tokugawas!


881
01:36:01.584 --> 01:36:02.778
I agree!

882
01:36:03.019 --> 01:36:04.850
Calm down...

883
01:36:05.288 --> 01:36:08.621
...or the lower castes
will get excited as well.


884
01:36:09.759 --> 01:36:14.696
It is important that
we remain absolutely neutral.


885
01:36:15.164 --> 01:36:17.098
We must not take sides.

886
01:36:17.533 --> 01:36:21.367
All we need do is dress normally
and strengthen our gate.


887
01:36:22.572 --> 01:36:25.268
We aid no fleeing soldiers...

888
01:36:25.808 --> 01:36:30.040
...and we say nothing
about the war's outcome.


889
01:36:31.747 --> 01:36:33.009
Understood?

890
01:36:35.017 --> 01:36:41.320
Yoshimura-sensei picked that time
to appear before my father.


891
01:36:55.371 --> 01:36:56.531
Kanichiro?!

892
01:36:58.508 --> 01:37:00.169
Yoshimura's here?!

893
01:37:00.510 --> 01:37:06.176
He's in front of the gate,
badly wounded.


894
01:37:07.116 --> 01:37:08.447
Yoshimura!

895
01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:12.579
What should we do?

896
01:37:15.324 --> 01:37:18.555
All right, bring him
into the back garden.


897
01:37:19.095 --> 01:37:20.426
Yes, sir!

898
01:37:33.342 --> 01:37:35.936
Why did he have to come now?!

899
01:37:36.979 --> 01:37:38.207
Why?!

900
01:37:53.696 --> 01:37:57.564
You bloody fool!
You should be ashamed.


901
01:37:58.668 --> 01:38:00.192
Yoshimura!

902
01:38:15.985 --> 01:38:18.249
Squire Jiroemon...

903
01:38:31.367 --> 01:38:34.165
While our battle has ended...

904
01:38:35.871 --> 01:38:38.999
...in total defeat...

905
01:38:40.776 --> 01:38:44.405
...to die here at the hands
of some villain...


906
01:38:46.582 --> 01:38:49.813
...would be a wasted death.

907
01:38:51.554 --> 01:38:59.051
If I may, I would like to be
of service to my own land.


908
01:39:00.463 --> 01:39:03.432
I would like to return there.

909
01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:06.200
Now?

910
01:39:07.203 --> 01:39:09.467
A true Nanbu samurai...

911
01:39:09.939 --> 01:39:14.876
...would go back to the Shinsengumi
and die there like a man.


912
01:39:21.283 --> 01:39:22.682
I beg you!

913
01:39:22.952 --> 01:39:24.510
Yoshimura...

914
01:39:25.855 --> 01:39:28.255
...after what you've done...

915
01:39:29.792 --> 01:39:34.525
...I couldn't possibly ask
the clan to take you back!


916
01:39:35.798 --> 01:39:37.060
At least...

917
01:39:38.601 --> 01:39:41.934
...until my wounds heal.

918
01:39:44.106 --> 01:39:46.131
For the sake...

919
01:39:47.443 --> 01:39:50.879
...of all our years of friendship.

920
01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:54.438
To all the men of all the clans!

921
01:39:54.984 --> 01:39:57.544
Report all rebel soldiers...

922
01:39:57.853 --> 01:40:00.378
...to the Imperial Army!

923
01:40:01.123 --> 01:40:02.852
Conceal them...

924
01:40:03.292 --> 01:40:05.920
...and your clan will be suppressed!

925
01:40:06.896 --> 01:40:09.023
I say again...

926
01:40:10.232 --> 01:40:12.996
Report all rebel soldiers...

927
01:40:13.335 --> 01:40:16.031
...to the Imperial Army!

928
01:40:17.073 --> 01:40:21.737
Conceal them
and your clan will be suppressed!


929
01:40:23.412 --> 01:40:24.777
Yoshimura...

930
01:40:26.949 --> 01:40:28.678
...you're a disgrace.

931
01:40:31.687 --> 01:40:33.587
We will leave you alone.

932
01:40:37.593 --> 01:40:38.423
Kill yourself.

933
01:40:53.509 --> 01:40:56.342
This is not an entertainment!

934
01:40:56.712 --> 01:40:58.009
Begone!

935
01:41:13.863 --> 01:41:18.323
I'm sorry, Sasuke.

936
01:42:06.115 --> 01:42:07.343
Kanichiro...

937
01:42:08.984 --> 01:42:12.249
...why did you fight at Toba
-Fushimi?

938
01:42:13.422 --> 01:42:18.291
Why didn't you join the Shogun
at Osaka Castle?


939
01:42:19.528 --> 01:42:23.362
Together, you might have had a chance.

940
01:42:25.434 --> 01:42:30.701
The way you are now,
how could you escape anywhere?


941
01:42:33.375 --> 01:42:34.865
It was...

942
01:42:37.346 --> 01:42:41.180
...out of duty I fought.

943
01:42:46.255 --> 01:42:48.985
We lost, it's true...

944
01:42:50.426 --> 01:42:53.020
...but I'm not dead yet.

945
01:42:55.064 --> 01:42:57.430
While I'm still alive...

946
01:42:59.335 --> 01:43:02.793
...I want to go back to Morioka.

947
01:43:05.007 --> 01:43:07.498
I want to see Shizu...

948
01:43:10.012 --> 01:43:11.639
...and my children.

949
01:43:15.050 --> 01:43:19.248
Nanbu is my land.

950
01:43:19.989 --> 01:43:24.392
I can't put you on the scales
against all of Nanbu.


951
01:43:25.628 --> 01:43:27.823
If it were only me,
I would die for you.


952
01:43:29.198 --> 01:43:34.226
But I can't make Nanbu the enemy
of His Majesty just for you.


953
01:43:36.672 --> 01:43:40.972
That sword of yours
won't cut any more.


954
01:43:42.311 --> 01:43:44.245
I'll give you mine.

955
01:43:47.883 --> 01:43:51.148
It's made
by Yamato no Kami Yasusada.


956
01:43:59.361 --> 01:44:03.855
Use it to cut open your stomach
like a samurai should.


957
01:44:38.901 --> 01:44:42.701
Please help him! Father!

958
01:45:16.739 --> 01:45:17.899
Sir?

959
01:45:21.744 --> 01:45:25.737
A hungry man
can't meet death properly.


960
01:45:26.148 --> 01:45:27.740
I'll give him some food.

961
01:45:28.884 --> 01:45:32.183
I didn't realize. I'm sorry.

962
01:45:33.188 --> 01:45:34.553
I'll do it.

963
01:45:36.025 --> 01:45:41.520
I didn't think about it until just now.

964
01:45:43.132 --> 01:45:46.568
Take him some hot water as well.

965
01:45:56.345 --> 01:45:58.040
Is it snowing...

966
01:46:00.049 --> 01:46:02.779
...in Nanbu now. too?

967
01:46:04.686 --> 01:46:07.314
Powder snow...

968
01:46:10.726 --> 01:46:13.422
Oh, dear...

969
01:46:15.764 --> 01:46:18.164
Now what?

970
01:46:40.289 --> 01:46:41.517
Here.

971
01:47:12.321 --> 01:47:14.050
This rice...

972
01:47:18.127 --> 01:47:21.119
...comes from Nanbu...

973
01:47:25.901 --> 01:47:31.635
Nanbu rice...

974
01:47:35.477 --> 01:47:37.172
It's so good...

975
01:47:38.947 --> 01:47:45.079
So good I drool to think of it.

976
01:47:47.589 --> 01:47:48.749
Enjoy it.

977
01:47:51.627 --> 01:47:55.358
Take your time and enjoy it.

978
01:48:06.708 --> 01:48:08.505
Thank you.

979
01:49:22.417 --> 01:49:23.850
First...

980
01:49:27.155 --> 01:49:29.089
...one ryo.

981
01:49:31.093 --> 01:49:33.425
A kimono sash for Shizu.

982
01:49:35.330 --> 01:49:38.663
This one ryo...

983
01:49:41.370 --> 01:49:44.498
...is for Mitsu's Doll
-Festival stand.

984
01:49:45.707 --> 01:49:51.270
This one's for Keijiro's baby robe.

985
01:49:55.917 --> 01:49:58.977
Well, what do you know?

986
01:50:01.456 --> 01:50:08.658
Here I wanted to buy
Kaichiro a sword...


987
01:50:09.598 --> 01:50:12.294
...but I don't have the money.

988
01:50:15.404 --> 01:50:16.894
Kaichiro...

989
01:50:20.375 --> 01:50:24.209
...nothing could make you cry,
could it.


990
01:50:26.315 --> 01:50:27.782
I didn't...

991
01:50:29.084 --> 01:50:32.611
...deserve a son like you.

992
01:50:43.231 --> 01:50:46.359
Kaichiro and Mitsu...

993
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:52.338
...and Keijiro, who I've never seen...

994
01:50:59.314 --> 01:51:01.214
I want to...

995
01:51:03.585 --> 01:51:05.382
...hold you.

996
01:51:14.262 --> 01:51:17.754
Shizu...

997
01:51:20.268 --> 01:51:25.968
...what are you doing right now?

998
01:51:31.113 --> 01:51:35.550
Can you hear the words
my heart speaks...


999
01:51:39.087 --> 01:51:41.749
...that I never could say?

1000
01:51:46.261 --> 01:51:47.728
I fell...

1001
01:51:50.232 --> 01:51:52.996
...completely in love with you.

1002
01:51:57.472 --> 01:51:58.871
I tried...

1003
01:52:00.108 --> 01:52:04.477
...as hard as I could.

1004
01:52:07.115 --> 01:52:11.677
I did all I could.

1005
01:52:15.991 --> 01:52:17.424
You...

1006
01:52:20.462 --> 01:52:23.431
...don't mind, do you?

1007
01:52:26.768 --> 01:52:28.167
Shizu?

1008
01:52:31.773 --> 01:52:34.298
It's all right if I...

1009
01:52:37.078 --> 01:52:38.705
...kill myself?

1010
01:52:44.786 --> 01:52:46.947
Forgive me.

1011
01:52:50.158 --> 01:52:53.127
'Let's go to the peach tree.

1012
01:52:53.261 --> 01:52:57.163
'lf there are any peaches,
we'll pick them.


1013
01:52:57.299 --> 01:53:00.496
'Five for Uncle... '

1014
01:53:04.539 --> 01:53:13.174
I can hear Mitsu singing...
such a sweet little voice...


1015
01:53:28.797 --> 01:53:30.389
Mitsu...

1016
01:53:33.134 --> 01:53:39.630
...you were never out of my mind...

1017
01:53:40.242 --> 01:53:42.802
...even for a single day.

1018
01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:47.440
It's as if...

1019
01:53:49.284 --> 01:53:51.252
...you're the only one...

1020
01:53:52.454 --> 01:53:56.857
...I wasn't apart
from for even a minute.


1021
01:54:01.796 --> 01:54:03.593
So Mitsu...

1022
01:54:06.067 --> 01:54:08.831
...even though I kill myself...

1023
01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:16.771
...I'll always be by your side.

1024
01:54:29.691 --> 01:54:31.750
Now I'm going to die.

1025
01:54:38.033 --> 01:54:39.500
Shizu...

1026
01:54:41.469 --> 01:54:42.902
Kaichiro...

1027
01:54:44.839 --> 01:54:46.170
Mitsu...

1028
01:54:48.777 --> 01:54:50.267
Keijiro...

1029
01:54:53.848 --> 01:55:02.586
I'm not going to hell, or to heaven.

1030
01:55:05.126 --> 01:55:06.491
I'm...

1031
01:55:10.565 --> 01:55:13.056
...going to be with you...

1032
01:55:16.638 --> 01:55:19.038
...every second...

1033
01:55:22.911 --> 01:55:24.469
...with you!

1034
01:55:40.095 --> 01:55:45.727
I was there when
Yoshimura-sensei died.


1035
01:56:04.285 --> 01:56:05.547
Sir...

1036
01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:13.719
''Take these two things...''

1037
01:56:13.828 --> 01:56:16.194
''...to my home.'"

1038
01:56:16.698 --> 01:56:18.188
He didn't use the sword!

1039
01:56:30.679 --> 01:56:32.943
You didn't touch the rice...

1040
01:56:35.016 --> 01:56:36.847
...you stubborn mule!

1041
01:56:40.455 --> 01:56:41.945
Kanichiro!

1042
01:56:44.559 --> 01:56:45.992
Kanichiro!

1043
01:56:50.799 --> 01:56:51.993
Eat!

1044
01:56:52.901 --> 01:56:54.300
Eat!

1045
01:56:56.004 --> 01:56:57.801
It's Nanbu rice.

1046
01:56:59.441 --> 01:57:04.504
From Morioka,
grown with Kitakami River water.


1047
01:57:06.247 --> 01:57:07.407
Eat!

1048
01:57:12.987 --> 01:57:14.477
Kanichiro...

1049
01:57:16.691 --> 01:57:18.386
...because of you...

1050
01:57:19.694 --> 01:57:23.926
...Shizu and the children eat their fill.

1051
01:57:26.401 --> 01:57:28.892
It's your turn now.

1052
01:57:30.705 --> 01:57:34.971
You dreamed of Nanbu rice.

1053
01:57:38.179 --> 01:57:40.113
Eat, Kanichiro!

1054
01:57:41.316 --> 01:57:43.409
It's good!

1055
01:57:47.222 --> 01:57:48.780
Kanichiro!

1056
01:57:51.426 --> 01:57:53.223
Kanichiro!

1057
01:58:04.572 --> 01:58:08.838
He was named one of
Lord Tokugawa's advance guard...


1058
01:58:10.812 --> 01:58:13.508
...and served well.

1059
01:58:15.683 --> 01:58:20.814
Rather than suffer dishonor...

1060
01:58:21.890 --> 01:58:26.293
...he asked to commit hara-kiri.

1061
01:58:27.495 --> 01:58:32.296
That was his choice?

1062
01:58:35.236 --> 01:58:36.863
Yes.

1063
01:58:39.007 --> 01:58:41.202
He refused a second...

1064
01:58:42.811 --> 01:58:45.974
...and bravely, alone...

1065
01:58:46.247 --> 01:58:48.374
...cut open his stomach.

1066
01:58:51.219 --> 01:58:53.847
With that sword?

1067
01:58:54.722 --> 01:58:55.950
No.

1068
01:58:56.624 --> 01:59:00.219
He wanted to give it to you.

1069
01:59:01.162 --> 01:59:03.323
He didn't want it stained.

1070
01:59:04.899 --> 01:59:06.560
He used another.

1071
01:59:09.204 --> 01:59:11.001
I see...

1072
01:59:19.347 --> 01:59:21.076
Husband...

1073
01:59:23.618 --> 01:59:26.052
...thank you.

1074
01:59:29.290 --> 01:59:35.058
You worked so hard...

1075
01:59:37.765 --> 01:59:39.494
...to support us.

1076
01:59:44.138 --> 01:59:46.436
Thank you.

1077
02:00:29.217 --> 02:00:31.549
So that's what happened...

1078
02:00:37.959 --> 02:00:45.127
Ordering him to do that must have
broken your father's heart.


1079
02:00:47.869 --> 02:00:50.838
Suddenly, after that...

1080
02:00:52.407 --> 02:00:57.276
...my father was like a different man.

1081
02:00:57.378 --> 02:01:00.108
They must never
become the Imperial army!


1082
02:01:00.682 --> 02:01:04.880
The southwestern clans
started this war.


1083
02:01:05.019 --> 02:01:06.577
They are the rebels!

1084
02:01:06.688 --> 02:01:10.317
He had always been so cautious...

1085
02:01:10.491 --> 02:01:13.654
...but when Akita went over
to the southwestern clans...


1086
02:01:13.761 --> 02:01:17.390
...he led the attack on it.

1087
02:01:18.533 --> 02:01:21.559
I call on the samurai of Nanbu
to do their duty!


1088
02:01:21.669 --> 02:01:24.729
I can only think...

1089
02:01:25.039 --> 02:01:30.602
...that he was looking for death
in battle himself.


1090
02:01:31.346 --> 02:01:35.578
And, sadly, he found it.

1091
02:01:49.330 --> 02:01:52.390
May all be well with you.

1092
02:02:10.918 --> 02:02:12.112
Squire Chiaki!

1093
02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:20.688
Kaichiro...

1094
02:02:29.804 --> 02:02:32.773
I'm going to Hakodate to fight.

1095
02:02:34.776 --> 02:02:36.266
At the fort there?

1096
02:02:36.511 --> 02:02:37.500
Yes.

1097
02:02:38.479 --> 02:02:42.472
You'll never come back
alive out of there!


1098
02:02:47.722 --> 02:02:49.417
I don't care.

1099
02:02:50.458 --> 02:02:55.987
That's not very smart. Why go
if you know you won't come back?


1100
02:02:56.831 --> 02:03:01.291
The duty of a Nanbu samurai
is to fight until the very last.


1101
02:03:09.911 --> 02:03:12.641
Don't go! Don't go!

1102
02:03:17.085 --> 02:03:18.245
Mitsu...

1103
02:03:19.454 --> 02:03:21.422
...you can't stop him.

1104
02:03:44.579 --> 02:03:47.878
This is far enough, 
Squire Chiaki.

1105
02:03:48.583 --> 02:03:50.175
Thank you.

1106
02:03:52.286 --> 02:03:56.552
This is pure spring-water.
Let's drink from it...


1107
02:03:57.625 --> 02:03:59.183
...for luck.

1108
02:04:08.002 --> 02:04:10.596
Drink from my hands.

1109
02:04:18.679 --> 02:04:21.705
Now you drink from mine.

1110
02:04:28.523 --> 02:04:29.547
Here.

1111
02:04:35.897 --> 02:04:38.923
I won't take it!

1112
02:04:40.768 --> 02:04:45.330
When everyone else
is trying to stay alive...


1113
02:04:46.507 --> 02:04:48.441
...you're going to die!

1114
02:04:51.112 --> 02:04:55.310
You're only 16!
You haven't lived yet!


1115
02:04:57.919 --> 02:05:01.548
Why do you have to die?

1116
02:05:04.625 --> 02:05:06.024
Squire Chiaki...

1117
02:05:07.695 --> 02:05:13.065
...I can't leave the father I love
to cross the River of Death alone.


1118
02:05:22.109 --> 02:05:25.044
So please... drink.

1119
02:05:36.691 --> 02:05:37.988
Kaichiro...

1120
02:05:39.260 --> 02:05:40.454
...don't die!

1121
02:05:43.631 --> 02:05:44.962
Kaichiro!

1122
02:05:50.271 --> 02:05:51.465
Chiaki...

1123
02:05:54.408 --> 02:05:55.636
Chiaki...

1124
02:05:57.111 --> 02:05:58.578
Chiaki!

1125
02:06:00.514 --> 02:06:01.776
Kaichiro...

1126
02:06:02.817 --> 02:06:04.114
...don't die!

1127
02:06:05.219 --> 02:06:06.550
Don't die!

1128
02:06:07.688 --> 02:06:11.818
Brother! Don't go away!

1129
02:06:29.777 --> 02:06:33.474
Mitsu... I have to.

1130
02:06:34.115 --> 02:06:35.377
Brother!

1131
02:06:36.784 --> 02:06:38.251
Brother!

1132
02:06:44.392 --> 02:06:46.292
Brother!

1133
02:06:47.762 --> 02:06:49.855
Look after her, will you?

1134
02:06:52.066 --> 02:06:55.797
I will go and fight for Nanbu.

1135
02:07:13.421 --> 02:07:16.254
Brother! Brother!

1136
02:07:17.591 --> 02:07:18.819
Brother!

1137
02:07:30.404 --> 02:07:35.068
Kaichiro never came back
to Morioka.


1138
02:07:35.543 --> 02:07:40.446
He died in the Battle of Hakodate.

1139
02:07:41.482 --> 02:07:43.109
Brother!

1140
02:07:43.217 --> 02:07:44.343
Mitsu!

1141
02:07:45.086 --> 02:07:48.522
I'll be your big brother now.

1142
02:07:55.396 --> 02:07:59.662
And then, later on...

1143
02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.468
...I married Mitsu.

1144
02:08:29.296 --> 02:08:30.422
There!

1145
02:08:31.932 --> 02:08:32.956
All finished!

1146
02:08:33.067 --> 02:08:35.467
Well done!

1147
02:08:36.170 --> 02:08:37.694
Sorry to keep you.

1148
02:08:37.838 --> 02:08:38.998
Minoru...

1149
02:08:44.011 --> 02:08:47.777
I don't think it's serious.
Just a cold.


1150
02:08:49.450 --> 02:08:54.513
I've mixed some medicine
for his symptoms.


1151
02:08:55.089 --> 02:08:58.616
Give it to him after meals,
and see he gets lots of rest.


1152
02:09:00.594 --> 02:09:02.619
Make sure you take this. OK?

1153
02:09:11.205 --> 02:09:15.198
My humble thanks,
Yoshimura-sensei.


1154
02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:27.578
Well...

1155
02:09:36.096 --> 02:09:38.121
Thank you for your help.

1156
02:09:40.801 --> 02:09:42.530
Take care.

1157
02:09:47.374 --> 02:09:48.432
Come on.

1158
02:10:03.858 --> 02:10:10.286
Morioka, in Nanbu.
It's a beautiful place.


1159
02:10:11.332 --> 02:10:14.824
Away to the south is Mt Hayachine...

1160
02:10:15.202 --> 02:10:19.571
...with Mt Nansho and Mt Azumane
to the west.


1161
02:10:23.611 --> 02:10:29.914
In the north are
Mt Iwate and Mt Himekami.


1162
02:10:30.918 --> 02:10:35.651
Out of the high mountains...

1163
02:10:36.090 --> 02:10:38.320
Grandpa, carry me!

1164
02:10:38.425 --> 02:10:41.485
No! A samurai walks!

1165
02:10:41.795 --> 02:10:43.126
Yes, sir.

1166
02:10:43.864 --> 02:10:47.891
Ah, it's pretty as a picture!

1167
02:10:48.269 --> 02:10:52.137
There's nowhere like it in all Japan!

1168
02:11:36.584 --> 02:11:39.610
May all be well with you.

1169
02:11:55.903 --> 02:11:59.339
Mitsu has lost so many
who are close...


1170
02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:05.307
...that even now in sleep she holds
my hand and won't let go.


1171
02:12:06.146 --> 02:12:11.550
Words can't express how much
of a help Mitsu has been to me.


1172
02:12:12.486 --> 02:12:15.421
After my father died in battle...

1173
02:12:15.689 --> 02:12:19.523
...my family were treated as rebels
and suppressed.


1174
02:12:19.727 --> 02:12:24.323
But perhaps that was luck,
as it made it possible for me...


1175
02:12:24.431 --> 02:12:26.456
...to marry Mitsu.

1176
02:12:27.835 --> 02:12:31.601
Sasuke, who has become the boss
of a gambling syndicate...


1177
02:12:31.905 --> 02:12:35.636
...looks out for us even now.

1178
02:12:36.944 --> 02:12:41.005
Mitsu and I have decided
to move to China...


1179
02:12:41.115 --> 02:12:45.017
... where we will practice medicine
in Manchuria.


1180
02:12:45.853 --> 02:12:50.290
We will cross the sea
and live in that empty land...


1181
02:12:50.758 --> 02:12:54.387
...and do the best we can there.

1182
02:12:58.132 --> 02:13:05.265
Morioka, in Nanbu.
It's pretty as a picture!


1183
02:13:05.372 --> 02:13:08.899
There's nowhere like it in all Japan!

1184
02:13:10.010 --> 02:13:14.003
The Morioka cherry blossom
splits through rock to bloom.


1185
02:13:14.682 --> 02:13:19.051
The Morioka magnolia blooms
even facing north.


1186
02:13:20.087 --> 02:13:25.024
So I want you to run ahead
of the times.


1187
02:13:26.126 --> 02:13:30.222
Go wild. Bloom.
