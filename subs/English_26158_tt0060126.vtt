1
00:03:17.903 --> 00:03:19.557
- How deep is he now?
- 400 feet.


2
00:03:34.355 --> 00:03:37.227
Craig, Doug here.
How are you doing, boy?


3
00:03:37.314 --> 00:03:41.362
I'm switching over to O-2-3,
I'll turn up from there


4
00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.625
and then we'll have
a sonar check, out.


5
00:03:43.712 --> 00:03:45.279
'Okay, steady to go, boy.'

6
00:03:49.152 --> 00:03:50.197
Hello, beautiful.

7
00:03:57.465 --> 00:03:59.554
What about that chopper,
they are still waiting


8
00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:00.903
for my permission
to come aboard.


9
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.774
I'll talk to them.

10
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:06.126
Doug here. Brinkman, if we
slow down and take you aboard


11
00:04:06.213 --> 00:04:07.823
we'll lose contact below.

12
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.086
Then please terminate
your mission and ask Dr. Mosby


13
00:04:10.173 --> 00:04:12.610
to surface at once.
I'm taking you both back


14
00:04:12.697 --> 00:04:15.657
to Federal Science Council
in Washington, urgent.


15
00:04:15.744 --> 00:04:18.877
Oh, right in the middle
of a test. Yeah alright, okay.


16
00:04:18.964 --> 00:04:20.052
Hey, look.

17
00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:31.455
- Craig?
- Yeah, go ahead, Doug.


18
00:04:31.542 --> 00:04:33.892
I want you to surface,
but there's a pod of whales


19
00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.113
above you, so maintain present
depth now until I tell you.


20
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.159
Roger, Doug.
I'll maintain this depth.


21
00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:40.638
Watch out
for those whales now.


22
00:04:40.725 --> 00:04:42.162
Yeah, Doug, I'm watching.

23
00:04:49.821 --> 00:04:51.562
Must be headed for their
breeding lagoons.


24
00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:52.911
Let's drop closer.

25
00:04:56.611 --> 00:04:58.221
What's he doing?
That'll make 'em dive.


26
00:05:01.746 --> 00:05:02.834
Get me the chopper.

27
00:05:05.924 --> 00:05:07.491
It's too late,
he's spooked 'em.


28
00:05:27.598 --> 00:05:29.948
Alright, come up now, Craig.
The whales have passed.


29
00:05:31.863 --> 00:05:33.996
- How do you do, Craig?
- Stand by, Doug.


30
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.616
Craig!

31
00:05:45.703 --> 00:05:47.618
Doug, I'm taking water in.

32
00:05:47.705 --> 00:05:50.447
- You build up air pressure?
- Roger, that's a maximum.


33
00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:53.624
- Then abandon.
- I'm coming up fast. Hang on.


34
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:56.192
I said abandon.
Get out of there, you hear?


35
00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:59.282
I can't, the hatch's stuck.
Left a dent from the collision.


36
00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:01.153
Break out the floatation gear.

37
00:06:01.241 --> 00:06:03.025
Underwater team, on the double.
Man your station.


38
00:06:03.112 --> 00:06:05.984
- How deep is he?
- 150 feet.


39
00:06:06.071 --> 00:06:07.856
Don't go away, pal,
I'll be right down.


40
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:21.173
That's it. Give me a wrench.

41
00:06:23.175 --> 00:06:25.221
I'll start off.
You follow me down.


42
00:06:25.308 --> 00:06:26.962
Give me my air down below.

43
00:08:55.545 --> 00:08:56.894
Rat!

44
00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.205
Be quiet, they're not rats.
They're guinea pigs.


45
00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:04.554
Hold these.

46
00:09:08.906 --> 00:09:10.038
Got you, come here.

47
00:09:12.083 --> 00:09:13.171
Craig, come on.

48
00:09:17.001 --> 00:09:20.091
- I've caught them all.
- Well, that's nice.


49
00:09:20.178 --> 00:09:21.789
We've got work
to do, boy.


50
00:09:21.876 --> 00:09:24.487
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- The guinea pigs.


51
00:09:24.574 --> 00:09:25.749
Oh, yes.

52
00:09:27.272 --> 00:09:29.187
You Americans,
always in such a hurry.


53
00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:36.804
'Of death and destruction
on a worldwide rampage'


54
00:09:36.891 --> 00:09:39.850
'these films show the tragic
effects of a tidal wave'


55
00:09:39.937 --> 00:09:41.417
'on a population centre.'

56
00:09:43.854 --> 00:09:47.597
- How do we relate this?
- Had to start because of him.


57
00:09:47.684 --> 00:09:49.686
- Who's that?
- The vice president.


58
00:09:53.821 --> 00:09:55.126
Vice President.

59
00:10:04.048 --> 00:10:07.487
'Giant waves strike in costal
cities first and always catching


60
00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:10.794
the population unaware
and unprotected.'


61
00:10:10.881 --> 00:10:13.710
'Although three fourths of all
earthquakes originate beneath'


62
00:10:13.797 --> 00:10:17.279
'the oceans, cities far in-land
cannot escape devastation.'


63
00:10:20.456 --> 00:10:23.590
'This Turkish city,
hundreds of miles from the coast


64
00:10:23.677 --> 00:10:27.419
'was struck by a quake
lasting only 27 seconds'


65
00:10:27.507 --> 00:10:31.119
'taking a toll of

66
00:10:31.206 --> 00:10:34.731
'As the casualty lists grow, the
pattern of earthquake activity'


67
00:10:34.818 --> 00:10:37.604
'becomes clearer and
the need for scientific study'


68
00:10:37.691 --> 00:10:39.519
'and action becomes imperative.'

69
00:10:47.483 --> 00:10:49.398
All of these earthquakes,
Mr. Vice President


70
00:10:49.485 --> 00:10:52.314
have happened during the first
few months of this year.


71
00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:55.709
Six times the average number,
three times the average strength


72
00:10:55.796 --> 00:10:58.320
and we feel there are more
coming of greater intensity.


73
00:10:58.407 --> 00:11:00.888
Is there any way
to foretell, where or when?


74
00:11:00.975 --> 00:11:03.717
Professor Hamaru has developed
a theory of forecasting.


75
00:11:07.503 --> 00:11:10.811
Sir, we cannot prevent
earth or sea quakes.


76
00:11:10.898 --> 00:11:13.553
But we can erect
a warning system.


77
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.512
We have a new vehicle,
The Hydronaut


78
00:11:16.599 --> 00:11:18.819
which is capable of
establishing that system.


79
00:11:18.906 --> 00:11:20.951
Did she prove that
on her shake down?


80
00:11:21.038 --> 00:11:23.867
I don't know, it just returned,
little scarred from a typhoon.


81
00:11:23.954 --> 00:11:28.219
But with a perfect score.
She was tested at 26,000 feet.


82
00:11:28.306 --> 00:11:30.526
She's fully automatic
and can circle the globe


83
00:11:30.613 --> 00:11:32.702
on one cartridge
of nuclear fuel.


84
00:11:32.789 --> 00:11:35.792
The Hydronaut was built along
lines of Dr. Doug Standish


85
00:11:35.879 --> 00:11:37.489
and engineered
by Dr. Craig Mosby.


86
00:11:37.577 --> 00:11:40.231
- Mr. Vice President.
- How are you, sir?


87
00:11:40.318 --> 00:11:43.234
I'm glad you got here,
I heard it wasn't easy.


88
00:11:43.321 --> 00:11:46.063
Well, I had help.

89
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.631
This warning system, once
established around the world


90
00:11:48.718 --> 00:11:50.981
would give us time
to evacuate the cities


91
00:11:51.068 --> 00:11:53.897
if an earthquake with an
intensity of the one in Alaska


92
00:11:53.984 --> 00:11:58.467
were to hit Japan without
warning, millions would die.


93
00:11:58.554 --> 00:12:00.991
This is the warning device.
It's so sensitive


94
00:12:01.078 --> 00:12:02.732
that before an
earthquake happens


95
00:12:02.819 --> 00:12:05.430
before it's seen or heard,
this device senses it.


96
00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:07.563
Obviously, we call
it a sensor.


97
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.870
The sensing devices are all
on this section here.


98
00:12:09.957 --> 00:12:12.655
'Let me show it to you.'

99
00:12:12.742 --> 00:12:16.877
These... veins here
will transmit the information


100
00:12:16.964 --> 00:12:18.922
to a seismographic centre.

101
00:12:19.009 --> 00:12:22.926
And down below... in here

102
00:12:23.013 --> 00:12:27.278
is an explosive charge
that anchors this device


103
00:12:27.365 --> 00:12:29.977
in place on
the ocean floor.


104
00:12:30.064 --> 00:12:33.937
Now, Mr. Vice President,
if we plant these sensors


105
00:12:34.024 --> 00:12:37.375
around the world under the sea,
then pressure points along here


106
00:12:37.462 --> 00:12:40.552
and through here and anchor
them in the crust of the earth


107
00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.859
we'll have the early
warning system we need.


108
00:12:42.946 --> 00:12:46.123
Well, this means a great deal
of risk, doesn't it?


109
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.213
We know less about the oceans
than we do the moon.


110
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.911
You're willing
to take on this risk?


111
00:12:50.998 --> 00:12:52.608
Well, that's why
we're here.


112
00:12:52.695 --> 00:12:54.784
Gentlemen, I'd like you
to proceed on the assumption


113
00:12:54.871 --> 00:12:56.568
that I can get
the necessary appropriation


114
00:12:56.656 --> 00:12:58.179
for the voyage
of The Hydronaut.


115
00:12:58.266 --> 00:12:59.354
Great.

116
00:13:34.955 --> 00:13:37.218
Yeah, we've got pretty good
visibility on this sub.


117
00:13:37.305 --> 00:13:40.351
We've got a TV camera topside
and we've got one out there


118
00:13:40.438 --> 00:13:42.440
in the bow
and one under the hull.


119
00:13:42.527 --> 00:13:44.921
Watch, let's see
if we can pick up Doug.


120
00:13:45.008 --> 00:13:46.140
Ah, there he is.

121
00:13:46.227 --> 00:13:47.968
'Look, see him?'

122
00:13:48.055 --> 00:13:50.405
'He's X-raying the hull from
any damage after the typhoon.


123
00:13:50.492 --> 00:13:52.755
Should be in,
in a minute or two.


124
00:13:52.842 --> 00:13:55.671
What about that crazy
color on the hull?


125
00:13:55.758 --> 00:13:57.629
It's pretty wild, isn't it?

126
00:13:57.717 --> 00:13:59.370
But it's international
rescue color.


127
00:13:59.457 --> 00:14:01.764
Now, you know, the sub
will change color


128
00:14:01.851 --> 00:14:04.854
as we go deeper, it moves from
yellow red through to green.


129
00:14:04.941 --> 00:14:07.335
What about your crew,
have you decided who you want?


130
00:14:07.422 --> 00:14:09.467
Yeah. Now we've got
to have Phil Volker.


131
00:14:09.554 --> 00:14:12.383
He's designed half the
electronic gear on board.


132
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:15.125
And we decided to go for
Orin Hillyard as the geologist.


133
00:14:15.212 --> 00:14:17.867
But here's where the hang up
comes, we want to combine


134
00:14:17.954 --> 00:14:19.956
our doctor and our marine
biologist in one.


135
00:14:20.043 --> 00:14:23.394
Doug and I don't agree on this,
I wanna go for Bob Johnson.


136
00:14:23.481 --> 00:14:25.527
Yup, I'm for a new comer
on the field.


137
00:14:25.614 --> 00:14:26.833
- Hello there, Gus.
- Hi, doctor.


138
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.269
Nice to see you.

139
00:14:28.356 --> 00:14:29.879
He's done some
very impressive research


140
00:14:29.966 --> 00:14:32.490
in Marine Biology.
M.E. Hanford, from England.


141
00:14:32.577 --> 00:14:34.579
I'm sure you've read
some of his published material


142
00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:35.972
the last couple of years.

143
00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:38.061
Her material.

144
00:14:38.148 --> 00:14:39.628
- What?
- What?


145
00:14:39.715 --> 00:14:42.239
The M.E. stands for
Margaret Elizabeth.


146
00:14:42.326 --> 00:14:45.808
Very attractive too. She just
finished a research for me.


147
00:14:45.895 --> 00:14:47.767
Now, shall we make it, Johnson?

148
00:14:47.854 --> 00:14:49.464
Why, because
Hanford's a woman?


149
00:14:49.551 --> 00:14:52.206
Half the doctors in Russia
are women, not a bad example


150
00:14:52.293 --> 00:14:53.381
for the rest to follow.

151
00:14:53.468 --> 00:14:54.817
He's got a point.

152
00:14:54.904 --> 00:14:57.254
You want a woman on a submarine
for four months?


153
00:14:57.341 --> 00:14:59.126
She's a scientist
and so are we.


154
00:14:59.213 --> 00:15:01.302
Brinkman says you met her
in the science building..


155
00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:02.390
...under a desk.

156
00:15:02.477 --> 00:15:04.174
- Her?
- That was M.E. Hanford?


157
00:15:04.261 --> 00:15:06.307
- What do you say now?
- No! No.


158
00:15:06.394 --> 00:15:08.352
Alright, don't worry,
first we've got to get


159
00:15:08.439 --> 00:15:11.094
Phil Volker and Hank Stahl,
without them we can't start.


160
00:15:11.181 --> 00:15:13.575
Stahl, he lives at the bottom
of the Caribbean Bay


161
00:15:13.662 --> 00:15:15.577
studying underwater survival,
you'll never get him.


162
00:15:15.664 --> 00:15:18.014
We've got to. At the depth's
we're gonna dive


163
00:15:18.101 --> 00:15:21.061
we can't plant our sensors
without his breathing gases.


164
00:15:21.148 --> 00:15:23.715
I'll get him, no matter
how deep he is. I'll get him.


165
00:18:09.707 --> 00:18:12.536
Well, Dr. Hamaru is all wrong.
I want no part of it.


166
00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:17.498
Well, then we can't do it.

167
00:18:17.585 --> 00:18:19.587
I mean it.

168
00:18:19.674 --> 00:18:22.024
Without you, it'd be impossible.
No one has your knowledge


169
00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:24.679
of breathing gases
at deep pressures.


170
00:18:24.766 --> 00:18:27.160
We've got to be able
to get in and out of the sub.


171
00:18:27.247 --> 00:18:29.597
What do you want with
a garage mechanic like me.


172
00:18:29.684 --> 00:18:32.774
I bet you've got guys with fancy
degrees who'll work for you.


173
00:18:32.861 --> 00:18:35.907
Yeah, sure. You're just
a big dumb hot head.


174
00:18:35.995 --> 00:18:38.345
Dr. Hamaru, warned me
about that line of yours.


175
00:18:38.432 --> 00:18:40.216
Well, I am.
I didn't go to college


176
00:18:40.303 --> 00:18:42.610
You know how I started
under water?


177
00:18:42.697 --> 00:18:46.483
Cropping keel for buck fifty
an hour, learn or drown.


178
00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.703
- You can give us all lessons.
- Soft soap.


179
00:18:50.661 --> 00:18:52.272
Is it... rabbits underwater?

180
00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:56.189
How did you accomplish this?

181
00:18:56.276 --> 00:18:59.105
Oh, that's
an artificial gill..


182
00:18:59.192 --> 00:19:02.543
...that allows them
to breathe underwater.


183
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.676
There's no garage mechanic, eh?

184
00:19:05.763 --> 00:19:07.983
- Now this, what's this?
- Uh.


185
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.943
Oh, these are embryo's,
shark embryo's.


186
00:19:12.031 --> 00:19:14.337
'They're called swell shark'

187
00:19:14.424 --> 00:19:17.514
Here, look. Right there.
See him turning around?


188
00:19:23.129 --> 00:19:28.003
See, he's trying to free himself
from the nourishing egg yolk.


189
00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:30.962
'There, see. He's trying
to break the umbilical cord.'


190
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:32.877
'They always do that
just before they hatch.'


191
00:19:32.964 --> 00:19:34.923
See him fighting
to get out of there?


192
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.056
'Look at that strength,
he wants to be born.'


193
00:19:41.147 --> 00:19:43.366
How's that for
their will to live?


194
00:19:43.453 --> 00:19:45.107
What about people,
their will to live?


195
00:19:45.194 --> 00:19:46.456
The millions who'll die

196
00:19:46.543 --> 00:19:48.589
if we don't put down
our warning system.


197
00:19:48.676 --> 00:19:50.939
People! Sharks, animals, they
kill each other for reason


198
00:19:51.026 --> 00:19:52.332
because they're hungry.

199
00:19:52.419 --> 00:19:53.942
People kill each other
for nothing.


200
00:19:54.029 --> 00:19:56.771
Wait a minute. There might be
some people like that.


201
00:19:56.858 --> 00:19:58.773
It doesn't apply
to the whole human race.


202
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.515
Boren was right.
He did say you're hard to reach.


203
00:20:01.602 --> 00:20:03.647
You let me in.
I haven't reached you yet.


204
00:20:03.734 --> 00:20:05.736
Go ahead and reach me.

205
00:20:05.823 --> 00:20:08.348
Alright. What about yourself?
You are people.


206
00:20:08.435 --> 00:20:11.090
You know that you built your
house over an earthquake fault


207
00:20:11.177 --> 00:20:13.222
that you're about 50 miles
from the Martinique Volcano?


208
00:20:13.309 --> 00:20:16.530
If we complete our system, we
can give you an advance warning.


209
00:20:16.617 --> 00:20:19.359
I couldn't care less, doctor.
Let 'em all go.


210
00:20:19.446 --> 00:20:21.796
You don't mean that.

211
00:20:21.883 --> 00:20:25.582
Well, maybe there are
a few human beings up there.


212
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:29.151
Dr. Hamaru, Gus Boren..

213
00:20:29.238 --> 00:20:33.112
...Dmitri, my crazy Russian
chess-playing friend.


214
00:20:33.199 --> 00:20:38.117
Hey, Dmitri. I just moved
my bishop from D2 to F4.


215
00:20:38.204 --> 00:20:40.467
Let's see you get
out of that one.


216
00:20:40.554 --> 00:20:43.339
Shortwave.
It's his move.


217
00:20:43.426 --> 00:20:44.688
It's your move, Mr. Stahl.

218
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:50.129
I couldn't care less.

219
00:20:50.216 --> 00:20:53.610
I got it made done here. I got
my research, my books, my music.


220
00:20:53.697 --> 00:20:56.657
Why'd I leave for idiots
who'll blow themselves up?


221
00:20:56.744 --> 00:20:58.572
You really think you can keep
on escaping like this?


222
00:20:58.659 --> 00:21:01.052
That it's not going
to bother your conscience.


223
00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.098
Conscience, doctor?
What conscience?


224
00:21:03.185 --> 00:21:04.317
You've got one.

225
00:21:06.145 --> 00:21:07.537
Here.

226
00:21:11.498 --> 00:21:13.587
This'll help you
get back home safely.


227
00:21:14.544 --> 00:21:16.198
To civilization.

228
00:21:16.285 --> 00:21:18.287
No, thanks. I wouldn't want
to salve your conscience.


229
00:21:18.374 --> 00:21:20.202
You'll never make it
without my breathing gas.


230
00:21:20.289 --> 00:21:22.030
- And you know it.
- That's right.


231
00:21:22.117 --> 00:21:25.816
Don't gamble on me coming out
after you, 'cause I wont.


232
00:21:25.903 --> 00:21:28.819
I can't believe that a man with
your intelligence will let


233
00:21:28.906 --> 00:21:32.083
a few million people die when
he could keep it from happening.


234
00:21:32.171 --> 00:21:34.651
I'm talking about you. You don't
have enough air in your tanks.


235
00:21:34.738 --> 00:21:36.349
What difference
does it make?


236
00:21:36.436 --> 00:21:38.742
I'm not on your preferred list
of people worth saving, am I?


237
00:21:38.829 --> 00:21:42.442
Here's a man who is. I don't
think you even read this.


238
00:21:42.529 --> 00:21:44.313
"Japan has borne seven
cataclysms from the sea


239
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.316
"in 29 years. If the one
which I fear is coming


240
00:21:47.403 --> 00:21:49.057
"strikes my country,
my dear Hank


241
00:21:49.144 --> 00:21:51.146
it'll be worse than Hiroshima."

242
00:25:01.249 --> 00:25:03.338
What the hell's
the matter with you?


243
00:25:03.425 --> 00:25:05.384
Trying to kill yourself?

244
00:25:05.471 --> 00:25:08.648
No, I knew
you'd come through.


245
00:25:08.735 --> 00:25:10.389
Well, just in case,
you didn't.


246
00:25:17.047 --> 00:25:19.485
Of all the lousy tricks!

247
00:25:19.572 --> 00:25:21.617
You had that thing
on top of you all the time?


248
00:25:21.704 --> 00:25:24.315
I'm sorry. But you
left me no alternative.


249
00:25:26.361 --> 00:25:27.928
Now that you've come
this far


250
00:25:28.015 --> 00:25:30.017
how about going all
the way with this?


251
00:25:30.104 --> 00:25:33.020
'That's a real
floatin' laboratory.'


252
00:25:33.107 --> 00:25:35.936
We've also got the crew.

253
00:25:36.023 --> 00:25:39.853
Well, right now my partner's
working on Orin Hillyard.


254
00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.289
At Harper Island.

255
00:25:51.386 --> 00:25:52.866
You'll be alright.

256
00:25:52.953 --> 00:25:56.826
Decompress for 20 minutes
and he'll be back to normal.


257
00:25:56.913 --> 00:25:58.654
Watch me from here.
Close the hatch.


258
00:26:03.746 --> 00:26:05.356
- Hi, I'm Dr. Craig Mosby.
- Jack Smith.


259
00:26:05.444 --> 00:26:06.923
Hi, Jack, how are you?

260
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.621
I've an appointment
with Orin Hillyard.


261
00:26:08.708 --> 00:26:10.013
- Is he still down below?
- Yeah.


262
00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.711
Can I go down
and see him?


263
00:26:16.585 --> 00:26:18.935
- Sure. Yellow flag's still up.
- Thank you very much.


264
00:26:22.809 --> 00:26:26.073
Oh, Jack, you got a lot of
divers in wet suits down there?


265
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.162
- Yeah.
- How'll I know who's Orin?


266
00:26:28.249 --> 00:26:29.642
- You'll know.
- Okay.


267
00:26:39.042 --> 00:26:41.305
- 'Anything the matter?'
- What?


268
00:26:41.392 --> 00:26:46.789
No, no, uh... could've sworn
I've seen those legs before.


269
00:26:53.274 --> 00:26:56.625
- Jack.
- Yes.


270
00:26:56.712 --> 00:26:58.366
- Was that Dr. Mosby?
- Yeah.


271
00:29:46.926 --> 00:29:48.014
'Lift him easy.'

272
00:29:56.109 --> 00:29:58.285
What the hell is
going around here?


273
00:29:58.372 --> 00:29:59.939
'Swing him over.'

274
00:30:00.026 --> 00:30:02.028
'Set him right on
to the deck.'


275
00:30:02.115 --> 00:30:03.159
'Easy now.'

276
00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.036
Who's the idiot inside
this diving suit?


277
00:30:12.516 --> 00:30:14.997
Dr. Mosby, I presume.

278
00:30:15.084 --> 00:30:17.304
Orin. Orin, what the devil
are you doing?


279
00:30:17.391 --> 00:30:19.436
Oh, we're testing out
some new mining gear.


280
00:30:19.523 --> 00:30:21.961
I wanted you out
of that water fast.


281
00:30:22.048 --> 00:30:23.223
Why?

282
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:38.586
Ha-ha. Thank you.

283
00:30:38.673 --> 00:30:40.762
'Thank you very much.'

284
00:30:40.849 --> 00:30:42.808
Oh, Maggie, you know
Craig Mosby?


285
00:30:42.895 --> 00:30:46.072
- 'Maggie Hanford.'
- Yes, I think we've met.


286
00:30:46.159 --> 00:30:48.857
- It's nice seeing you again.
- Hello, Dr. Mosby.


287
00:30:48.944 --> 00:30:52.426
- Orin, are you alright?
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine. I'm..


288
00:30:52.513 --> 00:30:53.732
Excuse me, please.

289
00:30:55.995 --> 00:30:57.736
What's the matter
with her?


290
00:30:57.823 --> 00:31:00.173
We got a phone message
for you from Dr. Boren.


291
00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.914
You're first choice
for medic is unavailable


292
00:31:02.001 --> 00:31:03.872
and there's no time
to shop around.


293
00:31:03.959 --> 00:31:05.134
We're getting
new tremors.


294
00:31:05.221 --> 00:31:06.875
- Oh, yeah, big ones.
- Ah, boy.


295
00:31:06.962 --> 00:31:09.486
Ah, Boren says you've got
to take Maggie


296
00:31:09.573 --> 00:31:10.879
even if you don't
want her.


297
00:31:10.966 --> 00:31:12.968
And, uh, unfortunately

298
00:31:13.055 --> 00:31:17.190
that was the part of
the conversation she overheard.


299
00:31:17.277 --> 00:31:20.062
- Well, I better go talk to her.
- Yeah. I think I would.


300
00:31:25.067 --> 00:31:27.156
- Dr. Hanford.
- Yes.


301
00:31:27.243 --> 00:31:30.203
I'm sorry about that message.
I hope you'll understand.


302
00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:33.946
'Let me be the first to welcome
you aboard the Hydronaut.'


303
00:31:34.033 --> 00:31:38.124
Orin and I shall be there. We
already know the starting date.


304
00:31:38.211 --> 00:31:39.952
Well?

305
00:31:40.039 --> 00:31:42.563
I hope Doug is having an easier
time recruiting Dr. Volker.


306
00:32:12.985 --> 00:32:15.422
Phil, I'll keep you on
the sonoscope.


307
00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:17.859
'How long do you think
you're gonna be?'


308
00:32:17.946 --> 00:32:21.036
- We'll be back in half an hour.
- 'I'll keep watching you.'


309
00:32:21.123 --> 00:32:23.430
Phil, will you tell me
why the guided tour


310
00:32:23.517 --> 00:32:27.129
in this half-pint sub of yours?
I've seen all these coral reefs.


311
00:32:27.216 --> 00:32:28.522
Patience.

312
00:32:47.497 --> 00:32:50.326
You know why I'm down here.
Come on, give me an answer.


313
00:32:50.413 --> 00:32:53.460
You came to me with the premise
of a recruiting sergeant.


314
00:32:53.547 --> 00:32:56.898
The least you can do
is to humor me for a few minutes


315
00:32:56.985 --> 00:32:58.944
while I show you
my latest gadgetry.


316
00:33:12.044 --> 00:33:14.133
Apparently, I've
succeeded in establishing


317
00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:15.961
electronic communication
with another specie.


318
00:33:21.531 --> 00:33:24.186
You watch.

319
00:33:27.624 --> 00:33:29.409
I talk.
He learns.


320
00:33:29.496 --> 00:33:31.585
You watch,
I'll make him turn.


321
00:33:34.414 --> 00:33:35.371
To the left.

322
00:33:38.635 --> 00:33:40.115
You need me?

323
00:33:42.552 --> 00:33:44.641
That's right.

324
00:33:44.728 --> 00:33:46.948
Well, I'll come.

325
00:33:47.035 --> 00:33:49.908
At a price.

326
00:33:49.995 --> 00:33:52.823
And just how high
is your price?


327
00:33:52.911 --> 00:33:53.955
Look, there's a manta ray.

328
00:34:13.279 --> 00:34:17.022
It's attracted
to the color of the submarine.


329
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:18.980
Ha-ha, and the dolphin's
attracted to the manta.


330
00:34:27.554 --> 00:34:28.903
And now..

331
00:34:32.385 --> 00:34:33.821
...the grand finale.

332
00:34:36.258 --> 00:34:38.304
What are you going
to do with the mine?


333
00:34:52.927 --> 00:34:54.494
Now, I'll make him
drop it.


334
00:34:59.455 --> 00:35:00.935
Don't worry. It won't
explode on contact.


335
00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.986
Now, he'll pick
it up again.


336
00:35:15.819 --> 00:35:18.344
What are you
up to now?


337
00:35:18.431 --> 00:35:20.476
You see the bottom
of that boat up there.


338
00:35:23.175 --> 00:35:25.612
- Well?
- Watch.


339
00:35:37.798 --> 00:35:38.886
That is magnetic.

340
00:35:42.324 --> 00:35:43.717
Poor thing.

341
00:35:43.804 --> 00:35:45.675
It takes quite
an intelligence to understand


342
00:35:45.762 --> 00:35:47.634
the devious mind
of a human being.


343
00:35:47.721 --> 00:35:49.201
Yeah, I know
what you mean.


344
00:35:49.288 --> 00:35:50.724
Excuse me.

345
00:35:50.811 --> 00:35:54.162
I arm the mine from here.
We head for the surface.


346
00:36:11.658 --> 00:36:12.485
Fifteen seconds.

347
00:36:14.791 --> 00:36:16.793
Turn your boat.
You're gonna blow her up?


348
00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.666
She looks new.
It $20 worth of paint.


349
00:36:19.753 --> 00:36:22.060
I like to dress up
my demonstrations.


350
00:36:35.595 --> 00:36:38.598
Impress you?

351
00:36:38.685 --> 00:36:42.210
Mm-hm. I suppose that's
just what you had in mind.


352
00:36:42.297 --> 00:36:43.559
Why?

353
00:36:43.646 --> 00:36:45.996
I want the Hydronaut
to make one dive for me.


354
00:36:46.084 --> 00:36:48.390
For me, personally.

355
00:36:48.477 --> 00:36:51.089
'You personally?
A dive for what?'


356
00:36:51.176 --> 00:36:55.180
To salvage four million dollars
worth of transistor crystals.


357
00:36:55.267 --> 00:36:56.964
You mean a treasure hunt?

358
00:36:57.051 --> 00:36:58.922
Phil, I came to talk
to you about people.


359
00:36:59.009 --> 00:37:00.968
- Thousands, millions of life.
- That's for you.


360
00:37:01.055 --> 00:37:04.928
I'm talking about millions
of dollars... for me.


361
00:37:05.015 --> 00:37:07.105
I don't buy.

362
00:37:07.192 --> 00:37:09.019
I don't go.

363
00:37:09.107 --> 00:37:11.239
Our mission is to
plant warning sensors.


364
00:37:11.326 --> 00:37:14.199
I know that. We take care
of my mission after yours.


365
00:37:14.286 --> 00:37:15.765
I can't commit
the crew.


366
00:37:15.852 --> 00:37:17.854
Don't worry.
How'd you say? Cut them in.


367
00:37:17.941 --> 00:37:19.726
What makes you think
they'll go along with you?


368
00:37:19.813 --> 00:37:21.249
Haven't you heard?

369
00:37:21.336 --> 00:37:24.034
It's better to be a rich
scientist than a poor one?


370
00:37:24.122 --> 00:37:26.124
If I didn't need you,
I'll tell you


371
00:37:26.211 --> 00:37:28.213
to go to the bottom
of the ocean.


372
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.259
The earth's crust
is crumbling, Douglas.


373
00:37:31.346 --> 00:37:32.826
You've no choice.

374
00:37:35.481 --> 00:37:37.135
We'll leave a week
from today.


375
00:37:48.233 --> 00:37:50.104
Alright, fellas, come on now.

376
00:37:50.191 --> 00:37:51.845
That's not chopped liver.

377
00:37:51.932 --> 00:37:53.673
Get up. Put it on
the floor there.


378
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.240
'Get it loaded.'

379
00:37:55.327 --> 00:37:56.806
'Easy, come on.'

380
00:38:12.518 --> 00:38:15.564
That's a set of whiskers
I haven't seen before.


381
00:38:15.651 --> 00:38:17.740
It's hydro electronic.

382
00:38:17.827 --> 00:38:19.829
From below to the surface,
surface to Syncom


383
00:38:19.916 --> 00:38:22.615
Syncom to Washington.
It's quite simple, really.


384
00:38:22.702 --> 00:38:25.226
We're all loaded.
Where's the dame?


385
00:38:25.313 --> 00:38:28.098
The dame is exercising
her rights as a lady.


386
00:38:28.186 --> 00:38:29.491
She's late.

387
00:38:47.248 --> 00:38:50.382
- Check. Good.
- Okay.


388
00:38:50.469 --> 00:38:52.427
Do you know what's
holding Maggie up?


389
00:38:52.514 --> 00:38:55.909
I understand she's exercising
a dame's right to be late.


390
00:38:55.996 --> 00:38:58.041
We can't sail without
a cook, you know.


391
00:38:58.128 --> 00:39:02.698
Margaret Hanford is as handy
with a skillet as a scalpel.


392
00:39:02.785 --> 00:39:04.874
You, um, you know
Maggie Han?


393
00:39:09.009 --> 00:39:11.838
'Hello, there.
A lady coming aboard.'


394
00:39:23.458 --> 00:39:25.721
Hi, how do you do?
We were worried.


395
00:39:25.808 --> 00:39:28.333
Thank you, Orin.

396
00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.726
- Hello, Dr. Mosby.
- Doctor.


397
00:39:33.207 --> 00:39:35.122
- Philip.
- Hello, Maggie.


398
00:39:37.298 --> 00:39:39.735
And you must be Mr. Stahl.
It's a privilege.


399
00:39:39.822 --> 00:39:43.217
- Just call me Hank.
- Just call me Maggie, Hank.


400
00:39:43.304 --> 00:39:45.741
Excuse me.
I have to get my hatbox.


401
00:39:45.828 --> 00:39:47.526
- Hatbox?
- Hatbox?


402
00:39:50.964 --> 00:39:53.183
Hatbox.

403
00:39:53.271 --> 00:39:55.882
You'll love it.
It's absolutely adorable.


404
00:40:00.365 --> 00:40:05.674
- Iddie and Biddie.
- Iddie and... Biddie?


405
00:40:05.761 --> 00:40:07.154
For oxygen analysis.

406
00:40:09.765 --> 00:40:11.114
Oh!

407
00:40:11.201 --> 00:40:13.116
Well, I see
we're all here now.


408
00:40:13.203 --> 00:40:15.728
- It's a real pleasure.
- Thank you.


409
00:40:15.815 --> 00:40:17.425
Get into the ward room,
everyone.


410
00:40:19.949 --> 00:40:21.995
- What the devil is that?
- Oh, uh, this.


411
00:40:22.082 --> 00:40:24.519
That's Iddie
and Biddie, buddy.


412
00:40:30.699 --> 00:40:31.657
Hm.

413
00:40:33.267 --> 00:40:34.921
He-he. That's very clever.

414
00:40:53.853 --> 00:40:57.073
Dr. Mosby. Dr. Mosby?

415
00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.988
Yeah, right in here.

416
00:41:01.295 --> 00:41:03.558
- Thanks. Look at this.
- Here you are, doctor.


417
00:41:03.645 --> 00:41:06.344
You sign for the sub should be
all civilian, we'll cast off.


418
00:41:06.431 --> 00:41:08.476
- Aha.
- All civilian?


419
00:41:08.563 --> 00:41:12.001
- You mean the ladies out?
- Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am.


420
00:41:12.088 --> 00:41:15.048
- Thanks, Doug.
- We're the whole crew?


421
00:41:15.135 --> 00:41:17.355
Well, the Gemini capsule
only had two.


422
00:41:17.442 --> 00:41:20.140
Thank you, sir. I wish you
and your crew all the best.


423
00:41:20.227 --> 00:41:21.271
Thank you.

424
00:41:21.359 --> 00:41:23.012
Please try not
to scratch her up.


425
00:41:23.099 --> 00:41:24.840
We'll do our best.

426
00:41:24.927 --> 00:41:27.277
As you already know, of course,
the program calls for us


427
00:41:27.365 --> 00:41:28.714
to put down 50 sensors.

428
00:41:28.801 --> 00:41:31.281
Now... here is where
the first one goes.


429
00:41:31.369 --> 00:41:35.024
The east end of a Puerto Rico
trench. Got that?


430
00:41:35.111 --> 00:41:37.418
Looks like the first one's
gonna be the toughest.


431
00:41:37.505 --> 00:41:39.246
'I, uh, assume that
after signing on'


432
00:41:39.333 --> 00:41:41.553
'no on has had
any second thoughts.'


433
00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.381
Okay, good.

434
00:41:43.468 --> 00:41:45.861
Well, I don't see any reason
why we shouldn't get underway.


435
00:41:45.948 --> 00:41:47.559
Man your stations.

436
00:41:47.646 --> 00:41:49.387
I thought we were
a civilian boat.


437
00:41:52.999 --> 00:41:55.436
Man your stations,
please.


438
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:03.618
Ten degrees.

439
00:42:16.544 --> 00:42:19.982
Doug, I'm adding negative ions
to our atmosphere.


440
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:23.333
Make us feel a little better
first time down.


441
00:42:23.421 --> 00:42:26.946
Hmm. Take a whiff of this.
I feel better already.


442
00:42:50.491 --> 00:42:51.927
We're coming over
the trench.


443
00:42:59.413 --> 00:43:01.850
We made that in 500 feet.

444
00:43:04.984 --> 00:43:07.508
Keep it moving.
Look out.


445
00:43:07.595 --> 00:43:10.206
Here. Make the drop.
Sensor number one.


446
00:43:12.644 --> 00:43:14.428
Orin, come up
and take over the scope.


447
00:43:17.344 --> 00:43:18.650
Easy.

448
00:43:29.574 --> 00:43:31.314
We're coming in over target.
Stand by.


449
00:43:36.624 --> 00:43:37.625
That's it.

450
00:43:43.805 --> 00:43:45.241
- You all set?
- It's fine.


451
00:43:45.328 --> 00:43:46.329
Let's get outta here.

452
00:43:53.162 --> 00:43:57.036
Bring the pressure up inside
to... eight tons per square inch.


453
00:44:03.521 --> 00:44:05.131
We left an empty tank
in there.


454
00:44:25.238 --> 00:44:26.892
Sensor in position.

455
00:44:26.979 --> 00:44:27.980
Roger.

456
00:44:29.024 --> 00:44:30.330
This is it.

457
00:44:39.121 --> 00:44:40.688
Sensor down.
Anchor it.


458
00:44:40.775 --> 00:44:42.429
Here goes.
Number one.


459
00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:55.268
Here.

460
00:45:10.805 --> 00:45:12.938
- Signal works great.
- Is it reaching Washington?


461
00:45:13.025 --> 00:45:15.027
I know my theory
and calculations are right


462
00:45:15.114 --> 00:45:16.506
as far as
the ocean agrees.


463
00:45:16.594 --> 00:45:18.204
- Craig, alert Washington.
- Roger.


464
00:45:20.336 --> 00:45:23.122
Hello, Seismo Washington.
This is Hydronaut.


465
00:45:23.209 --> 00:45:25.298
Hello, Seismo Washington.
This is Hydronaut. Over.


466
00:45:46.624 --> 00:45:49.104
'Hello, Seismo? 
Hello, seismo.'

467
00:45:49.191 --> 00:45:51.541
'Overseas call coming in
from the Hydronaut.'


468
00:45:51.629 --> 00:45:53.805
Hydronaut calling.
It's the Hydronaut calling, sir.


469
00:45:55.807 --> 00:45:58.418
Hello, Hydronaut.
This is Seismo Washington. Over.


470
00:45:58.505 --> 00:46:01.377
Standby for Dr. Standish,
over.


471
00:46:01.464 --> 00:46:03.858
Seismo, this is Hydronaut
from 30,000 feet


472
00:46:03.945 --> 00:46:05.555
in the Puerto Rico trench.

473
00:46:05.643 --> 00:46:09.342
No, I said 30,000. The chart
at this point is 5,000 feet off.


474
00:46:12.127 --> 00:46:15.435
Our first sensor is planted.
Are you receiving it's signal?


475
00:46:15.522 --> 00:46:18.481
The first sensor is down,
Dr. Boren.


476
00:46:18.568 --> 00:46:20.919
Doug, this is Gus Boren,
you alright?


477
00:46:21.006 --> 00:46:23.617
Hi, Gus. Ah, yeah, fine.
Everything routine. All well.


478
00:46:23.704 --> 00:46:25.401
Brink's gone to check
the reception now.


479
00:46:25.488 --> 00:46:28.100
- Okay.
- What's happening?


480
00:46:28.187 --> 00:46:30.929
They're checking.

481
00:46:31.016 --> 00:46:33.671
Pressure, strain, gravity, clear
as bell from the next room.


482
00:46:33.758 --> 00:46:36.325
It's alive down there. They must
be right over the pole.


483
00:46:36.412 --> 00:46:38.414
The reception
is as clear as a bell.


484
00:46:38.501 --> 00:46:40.982
Our signal is coming
through fine.


485
00:46:41.069 --> 00:46:43.506
The message says you better
get out of there now.


486
00:46:43.593 --> 00:46:46.509
Okay. We'll get back on course.
Hydronaut signing off.


487
00:46:46.596 --> 00:46:48.511
Well, our first one
is down, uh.


488
00:46:48.598 --> 00:46:49.991
Let's get back
upstairs.


489
00:46:50.078 --> 00:46:52.341
- Stations, everybody.
- Six miles straight up.


490
00:46:55.518 --> 00:46:57.129
Alright. Standby
to blow ballast.


491
00:47:48.223 --> 00:47:49.964
Oh, the air.

492
00:47:50.051 --> 00:47:51.879
Isn't it wonderful?

493
00:47:51.966 --> 00:47:54.403
Now don't tell me
you don't like submarines.


494
00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:57.145
Six miles down.

495
00:47:57.232 --> 00:47:59.452
Yes, and that's only
the first one too.


496
00:48:01.628 --> 00:48:03.325
How many more
are there?


497
00:48:03.412 --> 00:48:06.067
Forty nine.

498
00:48:06.154 --> 00:48:07.765
It's a bit confining
down there.


499
00:48:10.202 --> 00:48:12.508
'Maggie, don't worry.'

500
00:48:12.595 --> 00:48:14.510
'We're in good hands.'

501
00:48:14.597 --> 00:48:18.427
Orin, I'm glad you're here.
It makes things a lot easier.


502
00:48:21.256 --> 00:48:26.087
According to maritime law,
Doug could perform a marriage.


503
00:48:26.174 --> 00:48:28.655
Oh, Orin, can you imagine
spending a honeymoon


504
00:48:28.742 --> 00:48:30.352
on a submarine
with four other men?


505
00:48:32.311 --> 00:48:34.530
Yes, well, I have to admit
it's far from ideal.


506
00:48:36.794 --> 00:48:37.882
Thanks anyway.

507
00:48:53.027 --> 00:48:55.203
What is this,
Big Brother is watching?


508
00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:57.379
Well, it's better than
what you get on the television.


509
00:48:59.599 --> 00:49:02.036
Clear the deck. Standby to dive,
on the double.


510
00:49:02.123 --> 00:49:04.604
Well, how do you do,
Captain Bligh?


511
00:49:10.871 --> 00:49:12.960
Dr. Hanford.

512
00:49:13.047 --> 00:49:17.051
I asked you not to wear perfume
aboard this submarine.


513
00:49:17.138 --> 00:49:18.792
I'm not wearing any.

514
00:50:56.629 --> 00:50:57.630
Maggie.

515
00:51:01.199 --> 00:51:02.983
- Yes.
- 'Bring me a cup of coffee.'


516
00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:38.497
It's never the same.

517
00:51:38.584 --> 00:51:39.628
But always beautiful.

518
00:51:48.376 --> 00:51:52.772
Sometimes when I'm here alone
looking out there..


519
00:51:52.859 --> 00:51:56.515
...I feel I'm in
a some kind of a dream.


520
00:51:56.602 --> 00:51:58.517
You always
were a dreamer.


521
00:51:58.604 --> 00:52:01.128
A dreamer
and a scientist.


522
00:52:01.215 --> 00:52:03.391
They don't quite go together,
do they?


523
00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:37.121
I still don't know
which part of me


524
00:52:37.208 --> 00:52:39.819
was attracted to you
in the beginning.


525
00:52:39.906 --> 00:52:41.647
The dreamer.

526
00:52:41.734 --> 00:52:43.605
No, I think you're wrong.

527
00:52:43.692 --> 00:52:45.042
I think it was
the scientist.


528
00:52:52.005 --> 00:52:54.616
I remember the first time
I saw you, you looked so..


529
00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:01.319
...efficient.

530
00:53:01.406 --> 00:53:05.366
Do you think maybe we could pick
it up again where we left off?


531
00:53:05.453 --> 00:53:07.325
You're dreaming again.

532
00:53:07.412 --> 00:53:10.676
You know as well as I do.
It's quite, quite finished.


533
00:53:10.763 --> 00:53:12.765
Really?

534
00:53:12.852 --> 00:53:14.636
Are you so certain?

535
00:53:43.796 --> 00:53:45.711
A mountain,
and you didn't see it?


536
00:53:45.798 --> 00:53:48.192
That sonar must have been
going like a fire alarm.


537
00:53:48.279 --> 00:53:50.977
Only the two of you up here
while everybody's asleep.


538
00:53:51.064 --> 00:53:53.066
- Just what're trying for?
- Are you her father?


539
00:53:53.153 --> 00:53:55.286
- That's just...
- 'What're you, two boy scouts?'


540
00:53:55.373 --> 00:53:56.983
You're supposed
to be scientists.


541
00:53:57.070 --> 00:53:58.637
When'll you start
acting like that?


542
00:53:58.724 --> 00:54:00.813
- Stay outta this.
- Knock it off, knock it off.


543
00:54:02.641 --> 00:54:06.297
Maggie, take a look at Hank.
He got tossed out of his bunker.


544
00:54:08.734 --> 00:54:10.736
Orin, give her a hand.

545
00:54:16.916 --> 00:54:19.962
You didn't start reversing until
you actually saw the cliff?


546
00:54:20.049 --> 00:54:21.703
What about the sonar?

547
00:54:23.314 --> 00:54:24.619
I was on visual.

548
00:54:24.706 --> 00:54:26.665
Why didn't you see
that rock sooner?


549
00:54:26.752 --> 00:54:29.320
- Because I wasn't looking.
- What were you looking at?


550
00:54:29.407 --> 00:54:31.278
It's none of you business.

551
00:54:33.106 --> 00:54:35.500
Oh, it isn't, eh?

552
00:54:35.587 --> 00:54:38.067
Now, look. I'm aware
that I made a mistake.


553
00:54:38.155 --> 00:54:40.635
I'm aware that I've made a
complete, utter fool of myself.


554
00:54:40.722 --> 00:54:42.594
I'm sorry.

555
00:54:42.681 --> 00:54:44.900
Now, if you don't mind
we'll leave it at that.


556
00:54:48.948 --> 00:54:51.603
What do you think of having her
aboard now, huh?


557
00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:53.866
I think you better start
simmering down, Craig boy.


558
00:54:53.953 --> 00:54:56.782
We want to get
this job finished.


559
00:54:56.869 --> 00:54:59.828
And our job is
to put down sensors, right?


560
00:54:59.915 --> 00:55:03.180
Yeah, that's-that's our job.
Put down sensors.


561
00:55:15.192 --> 00:55:17.194
Have got you the answer
to Hydronaut's question?


562
00:55:17.281 --> 00:55:19.370
I'm just sending
it out now.


563
00:55:26.203 --> 00:55:29.902
A
-N
-F
-S
-Q-7, answer my request.

564
00:55:29.989 --> 00:55:31.817
Top priority reply.

565
00:55:31.904 --> 00:55:34.341
Computer analysis as follows.

566
00:55:34.428 --> 00:55:36.082
Rook takes queen.

567
00:55:38.084 --> 00:55:39.520
Check.

568
00:55:44.308 --> 00:55:45.961
Rook takes queen?

569
00:55:52.272 --> 00:55:55.101
Rook takes
Black's queen.


570
00:55:55.188 --> 00:55:56.624
Oh, pretty cocky,
aren't we?


571
00:55:56.711 --> 00:55:58.757
Playing a little over your head,
aren't you, buddy?


572
00:55:58.844 --> 00:56:00.889
Maybe,
don't you think


573
00:56:00.976 --> 00:56:03.022
a little incentive
might make us play better.


574
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:05.546
Well, what sort of stakes
did you have in mind?


575
00:56:05.633 --> 00:56:06.808
Something friendly.

576
00:56:06.895 --> 00:56:08.897
If I lose,
I do something for you


577
00:56:08.984 --> 00:56:11.422
and if I win... then
you do me a favor.


578
00:56:11.509 --> 00:56:15.556
- Favor? What for example?
- Oh, I don't know.


579
00:56:15.643 --> 00:56:17.602
Let's wait and see
how the game goes.


580
00:56:25.131 --> 00:56:28.308
Say, Doug, I've been
wondering for a long time..


581
00:56:28.395 --> 00:56:31.311
...how you got Phil to come in
this voyage with us.


582
00:56:31.398 --> 00:56:34.488
I know how you got me, that was
a fair shuffle, but Phil..


583
00:56:34.575 --> 00:56:36.534
I gotta be telling you
about this, something


584
00:56:36.621 --> 00:56:38.187
that he needs
your okay for.


585
00:56:38.275 --> 00:56:41.713
Something he needs
my okay..


586
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:48.023
Yes, yes, now I seem to remember
on that first dive, him saying


587
00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:51.549
"If I don't make your dive,
you won't make mine".


588
00:56:51.636 --> 00:56:53.899
- What dive?
- He'll talk to you about it.


589
00:56:53.986 --> 00:56:55.988
Yeah, so that's how
you hooked him, huh?


590
00:56:56.075 --> 00:56:57.946
You promised him one dive,
for what?


591
00:56:58.033 --> 00:57:00.340
- I'd rather he told...
- I'm asking you.


592
00:57:00.427 --> 00:57:02.777
I'm on this ride
for Dr. Hamaru, not for him.


593
00:57:02.864 --> 00:57:04.605
At least listen to him.

594
00:57:04.692 --> 00:57:06.999
Anything that he's in on,
I'm on the outside of.


595
00:57:07.086 --> 00:57:09.828
Now look, you hooked me once,
you're not gonna hook me twice.


596
00:57:09.915 --> 00:57:14.311
- What's the deal?
- I needed him and I needed you.


597
00:57:14.398 --> 00:57:16.008
That's the only way I could
get you both to come along.


598
00:57:16.095 --> 00:57:19.533
- 'You didn't have your mind?'
- 'No, I didn't.'


599
00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:21.666
'You don't have to do
what he's asking you to do.'


600
00:57:21.753 --> 00:57:23.711
'You're dynamite right,
I don't.'


601
00:57:26.235 --> 00:57:27.454
Position?

602
00:57:34.331 --> 00:57:37.682
Doug, we're approaching Ceylon.
We're 50 miles off the target.


603
00:57:37.769 --> 00:57:40.249
And we're getting
some shock waves.


604
00:57:40.337 --> 00:57:42.687
And we're getting
some shock waves.


605
00:57:42.774 --> 00:57:44.906
Okay, Craig. We're
approaching the Fumaroles.


606
00:57:44.993 --> 00:57:46.604
Better get ready, Hank.

607
00:57:52.349 --> 00:57:54.568
- Standby for sensor drop.
- Oh, roger.


608
00:57:57.136 --> 00:58:00.574
I want you to know, that if
Doug hadn't already promised


609
00:58:00.661 --> 00:58:03.055
I wouldn't go
on this dive of yours.


610
00:58:03.142 --> 00:58:05.884
I know that. If I needed
to ask you for your consent


611
00:58:05.971 --> 00:58:07.581
I wouldn't have come.

612
00:58:16.895 --> 00:58:19.506
Everybody, into
the control room.


613
00:58:25.338 --> 00:58:26.383
Fumaroles.

614
00:58:28.167 --> 00:58:30.212
Alright, standby
for exterior heat readings.


615
00:58:32.084 --> 00:58:33.477
120 degrees.

616
00:58:42.224 --> 00:58:43.356
130.

617
00:58:48.317 --> 00:58:49.406
140 degrees.

618
00:58:50.363 --> 00:58:53.061
165 degrees.

619
00:58:53.148 --> 00:58:55.586
Orin, what's the temperature
in the center of the fumaroles?


620
00:58:55.673 --> 00:58:58.415
Anywhere from 290 degrees to 320
degrees, boiling under pressure.


621
00:58:58.502 --> 00:59:01.592
We go in there, we're gonna
be in one big pressure cooker.


622
00:59:01.679 --> 00:59:03.898
Okay, boss,
how do you figure it?


623
00:59:07.162 --> 00:59:09.251
It's gonna be hot,
alright.


624
00:59:09.338 --> 00:59:12.516
'We'll have to get those sensor
in as close as possible.'


625
00:59:12.603 --> 00:59:15.954
'Have to do it by hand.
We'll have to swim it in.'


626
00:59:16.041 --> 00:59:19.653
- What do you say, Orin?
- Yeah, there's no other way.


627
00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:21.916
I know it's my job
to pick the spot.


628
00:59:22.003 --> 00:59:23.614
I'll come with you.

629
00:59:27.008 --> 00:59:28.749
Okay, let's break out
the hot suits.


630
00:59:32.405 --> 00:59:34.276
- Take over, Craig.
- Yeah.


631
00:59:34.363 --> 00:59:35.713
How about
the breathing gas?


632
00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.758
You told me to
get it ready, didn't you?


633
00:59:37.845 --> 00:59:39.368
Maggie.

634
00:59:49.770 --> 00:59:51.380
Alright, I'm settling
down in the bottom.


635
01:00:08.441 --> 01:00:11.096
This will help boost your
resistance to the heat.


636
01:00:11.183 --> 01:00:13.533
'When it gets hot there,
this gas is gonna taste sweet.'


637
01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:15.404
'But just keep
breathing normally.'


638
01:00:15.492 --> 01:00:16.971
Mag will be reading you.

639
01:00:17.058 --> 01:00:19.452
Keep talking. I'll know how
your are by your voices.


640
01:00:19.539 --> 01:00:21.933
Alright, let's put them
under pressure.


641
01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.674
- You okay, boy?
- Alright.


642
01:00:23.761 --> 01:00:25.023
Come on.

643
01:00:47.654 --> 01:00:50.048
Maggie, get up to control room.
Monitor them on the viewer.


644
01:00:59.884 --> 01:01:02.234
Stay with me.

645
01:01:06.455 --> 01:01:08.283
- Are they out?
- Yes.


646
01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:09.850
Put them on the TV.

647
01:01:11.896 --> 01:01:13.201
Put them on
the loudspeaker.


648
01:01:20.774 --> 01:01:22.428
Phil, Orin?

649
01:01:22.515 --> 01:01:23.864
Can you hear me?
Acknowledge.


650
01:01:23.951 --> 01:01:26.519
'Orin here, receiving you.'

651
01:01:26.606 --> 01:01:29.348
- Phil?
- Receive you, loud and clear.


652
01:01:32.177 --> 01:01:35.441
I want to hear Peter Piper.
Orin, you first.


653
01:01:35.528 --> 01:01:37.922
'Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers.'


654
01:01:38.009 --> 01:01:40.011
Phil.

655
01:01:40.098 --> 01:01:43.754
'A peck of pickled peppers
did Peter Piper picked.'


656
01:01:43.841 --> 01:01:47.105
'If Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.'


657
01:01:47.192 --> 01:01:49.455
'Where's the peck of pickled
peppers Peter Piper picked?'


658
01:02:03.077 --> 01:02:04.209
Alright, Maggie?

659
01:02:24.838 --> 01:02:27.406
Phil, give me
a heat reading.


660
01:02:27.493 --> 01:02:31.802
A 175 degrees.
Inside, it's a comfortable 80.


661
01:02:31.889 --> 01:02:34.239
Come on, keep repeating
Peter Piper.


662
01:02:34.326 --> 01:02:36.981
'Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers.'


663
01:02:37.068 --> 01:02:39.287
'A peck of pickled peppers
Peter Piper picked.'


664
01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:45.467
'...peppers Peter,
Peter Piper picked.'


665
01:02:45.554 --> 01:02:47.513
'Peter Piper..'

666
01:02:51.256 --> 01:02:52.518
Orin!

667
01:02:52.605 --> 01:02:54.999
Orin, can you hear me?
He's in trouble.


668
01:02:55.086 --> 01:02:57.654
Phil, Orin's in trouble.
Get to him quick.


669
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:02.659
Phil, do you read me? Over.

670
01:03:07.185 --> 01:03:08.708
Phil! Answer me.
Answer me, Phil.


671
01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.236
- Keep trying to contact.
- Phil, come in, Phil.


672
01:03:18.065 --> 01:03:19.414
Phil! Phil, do you read me?

673
01:03:27.118 --> 01:03:28.380
Phil's going for him.

674
01:03:48.879 --> 01:03:51.620
Don't risk it. It's too hot
out there for this suit.


675
01:03:51.708 --> 01:03:53.666
Orin's already picked
the spot for the sensor.


676
01:03:53.753 --> 01:03:56.060
I'll just get in there
and get out fast.


677
01:03:56.147 --> 01:03:58.715
Now, come on. Get out of here.
Put me under pressure.


678
01:04:21.302 --> 01:04:23.827
Standby to pick up
Phil and Orin.


679
01:04:23.914 --> 01:04:25.567
- Come on, Maggie.
- Craig, look. Doug's gone out.


680
01:04:31.138 --> 01:04:33.488
- Doug! Doug!
- Gimme that. Doug! Doug!


681
01:04:37.014 --> 01:04:38.363
Wait a minute. He doesn't
have a radio on.


682
01:05:26.411 --> 01:05:29.762
- Get him up!
- Hold it! Hold it!


683
01:05:29.849 --> 01:05:31.285
Come on, get him out.

684
01:05:31.372 --> 01:05:32.373
Watch the arm.

685
01:05:51.218 --> 01:05:55.614
Maggie, come and take
a look at Orin.


686
01:05:55.701 --> 01:05:58.617
Phil, what happened down there?
Didn't you hear me calling you?


687
01:05:58.704 --> 01:06:00.184
Hell, no.
I didn't hear anything.


688
01:06:00.271 --> 01:06:02.708
I just turn around
and saw him.


689
01:06:02.795 --> 01:06:06.451
Must have been a die out failure
or something with the heat.


690
01:06:06.538 --> 01:06:08.105
Yeah, the heat.

691
01:06:10.934 --> 01:06:13.632
I hope there's no failure
when I anchor the sensor.


692
01:06:17.418 --> 01:06:19.420
- How's Orin?
- He's alright, I think.


693
01:06:19.507 --> 01:06:21.727
Alright, standby
to take Doug aboard.


694
01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:39.136
Oh, I've never been
so hot in my life.


695
01:06:40.964 --> 01:06:43.183
Ah, pretty hot.

696
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:46.839
- Alright. How's Orin?
- He's okay.


697
01:06:50.234 --> 01:06:51.888
What happened to you
down there, Phil?


698
01:06:51.975 --> 01:06:54.281
He says he didn't
hear us.


699
01:06:54.368 --> 01:06:56.153
I didn't hear you.

700
01:06:59.025 --> 01:07:01.506
- Is Doug aboard yet?
- Yes.


701
01:07:01.593 --> 01:07:03.856
Alright, I'm anchoring
the sensor.


702
01:07:35.453 --> 01:07:37.411
You can reduce
the danger of the bends.


703
01:07:37.498 --> 01:07:39.674
Oh, boy, you're just a dumb,
old hard-hat, alright.


704
01:07:39.761 --> 01:07:41.938
Just like Doug says you are.

705
01:07:45.506 --> 01:07:49.380
Now, If I could find me
a mermaid built just like that.


706
01:08:01.392 --> 01:08:03.046
For once that guy and I agree

707
01:08:03.133 --> 01:08:05.091
on what would make
a really tasty dish.


708
01:08:06.179 --> 01:08:08.965
- 'Hello.'
- Hello.


709
01:08:09.052 --> 01:08:11.402
A swim in the middle
of the Bay of Bengal.


710
01:08:11.489 --> 01:08:13.360
Not every girl can
make that claim.


711
01:08:13.447 --> 01:08:16.363
What happens if a big,
hungry shark comes along?


712
01:08:16.450 --> 01:08:17.669
Shark?

713
01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:20.759
Or wolf?

714
01:08:22.065 --> 01:08:23.240
Ah..

715
01:08:31.378 --> 01:08:33.250
Maggie.

716
01:08:33.337 --> 01:08:35.992
What'd you say to making a
salvage dive in the Hydronaut?


717
01:08:36.079 --> 01:08:38.995
- Has Doug okayed it?
- Yes, but..


718
01:08:39.082 --> 01:08:41.432
I need everyone's consent.

719
01:08:41.519 --> 01:08:44.913
Yours and Hank's, and Orin's.

720
01:08:45.001 --> 01:08:46.828
Philip, Orin's very
grateful to you


721
01:08:46.915 --> 01:08:49.353
for going into the fumaroles
to help him.


722
01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.572
And so am I.

723
01:08:51.659 --> 01:08:54.445
Well, in that case, there's
something you can do for me.


724
01:08:56.664 --> 01:08:58.710
Well, then I'd say Orin
owes a speedy recovery


725
01:08:58.797 --> 01:09:01.713
to this particular mixture, huh?

726
01:09:04.411 --> 01:09:08.328
Well, looks like something
topless is going on topside.


727
01:09:11.331 --> 01:09:13.116
Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy.


728
01:09:13.203 --> 01:09:14.334
You'll blow a gasket.

729
01:09:15.814 --> 01:09:17.642
Share and share alike,
all of us.


730
01:09:17.729 --> 01:09:19.339
Then why should Hank object?

731
01:09:19.426 --> 01:09:22.429
Oh, he seems to hate everything
connected with civilization.


732
01:09:22.516 --> 01:09:26.172
But don't worry, I'm working
on a special approach to Hank.


733
01:09:26.259 --> 01:09:30.916
Could you, uh, possibly,
sort of persuade Orin for me?


734
01:09:31.003 --> 01:09:32.613
I'll tell you what?

735
01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:35.660
If you get Hank to agree,
I'll get Orin.


736
01:09:39.533 --> 01:09:42.058
Dr. Hanford,
can I see you, please?


737
01:09:46.932 --> 01:09:48.064
Close the hatch.

738
01:09:53.982 --> 01:09:55.462
Yes?

739
01:09:55.549 --> 01:09:58.378
Doctor, I don't know quite
how to tell you this.


740
01:09:58.465 --> 01:10:01.338
- Except, turn it off.
- What are you talking about?


741
01:10:01.425 --> 01:10:04.080
Are you trying to tell me,
you don't know the affect


742
01:10:04.167 --> 01:10:06.256
you're having on
the men on this sub?


743
01:10:06.343 --> 01:10:10.303
I'm not trying to have an affect
on anybody, especially you.


744
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:12.131
'Why?'

745
01:10:12.218 --> 01:10:14.873
Because I haven't tried to drag
you behind the conning tower?


746
01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.310
Maybe it's because I haven't
asked you to co-pilot me


747
01:10:17.397 --> 01:10:19.356
on a midnight watch.
Is that it?


748
01:10:19.443 --> 01:10:22.098
You wouldn't notice
whatever I did.


749
01:10:22.185 --> 01:10:25.927
I've noticed you
the first time I saw you.


750
01:10:26.014 --> 01:10:28.408
I noticed the way
your hair was fixed.


751
01:10:28.495 --> 01:10:30.976
I noticed your eyes..

752
01:10:31.063 --> 01:10:32.978
...and that perfume.

753
01:10:33.065 --> 01:10:35.372
I can still smell that.

754
01:10:35.459 --> 01:10:38.070
But that was Washington
and we are on a submarine


755
01:10:38.157 --> 01:10:41.029
and as long as we are
on this submarine


756
01:10:41.117 --> 01:10:42.727
I've turned you off.

757
01:10:42.814 --> 01:10:46.818
To me, you are M.E. Hanford.

758
01:10:46.905 --> 01:10:48.950
Doctor of medicine,
and that's all.


759
01:10:50.517 --> 01:10:52.911
Which is all I've been
since I came aboard.


760
01:10:57.655 --> 01:11:00.179
Now, look..

761
01:11:00.266 --> 01:11:04.096
We've got, maybe one more
month in this submarine.


762
01:11:05.445 --> 01:11:07.708
And after that..

763
01:11:07.795 --> 01:11:12.017
...after we get our work done..

764
01:11:12.104 --> 01:11:14.976
...we have a whole lifetime.

765
01:11:15.063 --> 01:11:18.066
A lifetime to find out..

766
01:11:18.154 --> 01:11:20.068
...what our feelings are
for each other.


767
01:11:38.522 --> 01:11:40.263
You men are
in beautiful shape.


768
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:42.178
Well, I might say
the same about you.


769
01:11:42.265 --> 01:11:43.875
Thank you, doctor.

770
01:11:43.962 --> 01:11:46.356
You, uh, you're pretty
rough on a man's blood pressure.


771
01:11:46.443 --> 01:11:49.054
If I weren't a happily
married man with few kids..


772
01:11:49.141 --> 01:11:52.231
I might be causing
a little trouble, too.


773
01:11:52.318 --> 01:11:54.712
Are you thinking about
what happen with Phil?


774
01:11:54.799 --> 01:11:58.106
- Do you think it was my fault?
- Well, let's put it this way.


775
01:11:58.194 --> 01:12:00.805
If you weren't there,
it wouldn't have happened.


776
01:12:00.892 --> 01:12:03.851
Where shall I hide myself?

777
01:12:03.938 --> 01:12:05.592
- In your work, I guess.
- I do.


778
01:12:05.679 --> 01:12:07.681
I know. You've been
doing a great job, but...


779
01:12:07.768 --> 01:12:08.900
I'm a problem.

780
01:12:08.987 --> 01:12:10.554
You men gave
us our freedom


781
01:12:10.641 --> 01:12:12.947
but sometimes it's difficult
to cope with.


782
01:12:13.034 --> 01:12:15.428
We'd better learn how to cope,
because you'll be there


783
01:12:15.515 --> 01:12:17.604
working right along beside us.

784
01:12:17.691 --> 01:12:20.477
Whether it's in outer space
or deep under the ocean.


785
01:12:20.564 --> 01:12:22.000
You'll be there.

786
01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.018
Check!

787
01:13:23.061 --> 01:13:24.715
Look at them,
thousands of them.


788
01:13:24.802 --> 01:13:27.457
Must be in some kind of a
special layer in the ocean.


789
01:13:36.161 --> 01:13:37.815
- Where did they go?
- Don't look at me.


790
01:13:37.902 --> 01:13:40.644
I didn't do it.

791
01:13:40.731 --> 01:13:42.820
Hank got to be through
collecting his samples by now.


792
01:13:51.916 --> 01:13:55.485
Uh, sensor number 41.
Nine more to go.


793
01:13:55.572 --> 01:13:57.487
You two, plant this one, huh?

794
01:13:57.574 --> 01:13:58.749
Okay, Phil?

795
01:14:03.231 --> 01:14:04.755
- Where's Maggie?
- In the lab.


796
01:14:04.842 --> 01:14:07.192
Let me tell you.
Just not an ocean out there.


797
01:14:07.279 --> 01:14:09.194
It's a veritable
minestrone.


798
01:14:09.281 --> 01:14:11.457
- What?
- You've never seen such food.


799
01:14:11.544 --> 01:14:15.200
Enough to feed a billion fish.
Look at that!


800
01:14:15.287 --> 01:14:17.594
- Yeah. But what is it?
- It's food. It's food.


801
01:14:17.681 --> 01:14:19.422
Hey, Maggie.

802
01:14:19.509 --> 01:14:21.162
- Maggie, I got something...
- Wait! Wait! Wait!


803
01:14:21.249 --> 01:14:23.513
I know, I know. You gotta
close the hatch.


804
01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.732
Come on, hurry it up,
will you?


805
01:14:25.819 --> 01:14:27.865
Come on. Come on!

806
01:14:27.952 --> 01:14:29.475
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah, go.


807
01:14:29.562 --> 01:14:31.564
Hey, Maggie!

808
01:14:31.651 --> 01:14:32.957
Look out, fellas.

809
01:14:34.741 --> 01:14:36.003
What's with him?

810
01:14:36.090 --> 01:14:37.918
Ah, he found
some minestrone.


811
01:14:38.005 --> 01:14:39.311
Mine..

812
01:14:39.398 --> 01:14:40.965
Put us under pressure,
will you?


813
01:14:41.052 --> 01:14:42.227
Oh, yeah.

814
01:14:43.881 --> 01:14:45.099
Phil, hold this, will you?

815
01:14:45.186 --> 01:14:47.275
Maggie. Maggie, look.

816
01:14:47.363 --> 01:14:50.278
Look at this.
Look at that food.


817
01:14:50.366 --> 01:14:53.107
There's life in there so big,
you don't need a microscope.


818
01:14:53.194 --> 01:14:54.848
But check it out
anyway, will you?


819
01:14:54.935 --> 01:14:57.547
I gotta feed Doug.
Hey, Doug, Doug.


820
01:14:57.634 --> 01:14:58.983
'Hey, Doug.'

821
01:15:03.553 --> 01:15:06.904
Hey, Doug, Doug. I gotta
get out there again.


822
01:15:06.991 --> 01:15:09.646
- Wanna get full set of samples.
- Hold it, Hank. Hold it.


823
01:15:09.733 --> 01:15:12.475
But the stuff out there
isn't even in the books.


824
01:15:12.562 --> 01:15:14.390
Okay, while they're
planting the sensor.


825
01:15:14.477 --> 01:15:16.130
- That'll give you ten minutes.
- Ten minutes.


826
01:15:16.217 --> 01:15:17.262
- Hank wait.
- Not now.


827
01:15:19.482 --> 01:15:22.485
Doug, have a look at this.

828
01:15:22.572 --> 01:15:24.400
What?

829
01:15:24.487 --> 01:15:25.705
There.

830
01:15:50.164 --> 01:15:51.862
- Craig.
- Yeah, Doug.


831
01:15:51.949 --> 01:15:53.603
Tell Hank to wait.

832
01:15:53.690 --> 01:15:55.169
Well, I can't. He's gone.

833
01:15:55.256 --> 01:15:57.084
- Well, call him back.
- Well, I can't, Doug.


834
01:15:57.171 --> 01:15:59.522
He hasn't got a radio.

835
01:15:59.609 --> 01:16:01.654
Ah, never mind,
forget it.


836
01:16:01.741 --> 01:16:03.656
You're worried
about him, aren't you?


837
01:16:03.743 --> 01:16:07.834
Huh? Oh, uh, it was just
a silly thought I had, but..


838
01:16:07.921 --> 01:16:10.620
Hank said there's a lot of fish
there like a feeding ground.


839
01:16:10.707 --> 01:16:12.273
You gave me this article.

840
01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:15.538
I read about, uh, little fish
being eaten by the big fish


841
01:16:15.625 --> 01:16:18.454
and the big fish being eaten
by the bigger fish.


842
01:16:35.383 --> 01:16:37.168
Position is good.
Move it over.


843
01:16:45.829 --> 01:16:48.179
- Doug, I'm planting the sensor.
- Okay, Craig.


844
01:16:51.704 --> 01:16:52.618
Alright.

845
01:17:01.932 --> 01:17:04.238
- Sensor down.
- Okay, boy, I'll anchor it.


846
01:17:46.106 --> 01:17:48.108
Sensor's coming through fine.

847
01:17:48.195 --> 01:17:50.067
Where's Hank?
Did you see him?


848
01:17:50.154 --> 01:17:52.243
No, he's got five
or six minutes, though.


849
01:17:52.330 --> 01:17:54.419
Oh, boy, I wish
we had him inside.


850
01:17:54.506 --> 01:17:56.421
Philip, you got Hank
in your scope?


851
01:17:56.508 --> 01:18:00.033
Yes, but I'm getting
something else.


852
01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:03.646
About 300 yards behind him,
moving along the bottom.


853
01:18:03.733 --> 01:18:05.604
Looks like another sub.
Or a whale?


854
01:18:05.691 --> 01:18:07.954
Whale?

855
01:18:08.041 --> 01:18:10.391
Whales might dive this deep but
never travel along the bottom.


856
01:18:10.478 --> 01:18:11.958
I see something.

857
01:18:12.045 --> 01:18:13.177
It's moving fast.

858
01:18:45.818 --> 01:18:47.428
I've lost him.

859
01:18:47.515 --> 01:18:49.126
He must be between
the ballast tank.


860
01:18:52.651 --> 01:18:53.870
Craig, Doug, look.

861
01:18:56.568 --> 01:18:59.136
- Where's Hank?
- I can't see him anywhere.


862
01:18:59.223 --> 01:19:01.878
- He must be under the sub.
- 'Well, I hope so.'


863
01:19:01.965 --> 01:19:04.010
Get in the airlock.
See if you can help.


864
01:19:09.233 --> 01:19:11.322
- Hank come in yet?
- 'He hasn't.'


865
01:19:11.409 --> 01:19:13.585
- Doug, you must do something.
- I don't know what. Phil.


866
01:19:13.672 --> 01:19:15.152
What can you do
electronically?


867
01:19:15.239 --> 01:19:16.893
Oh, nothing, His capacity
is higher than ours.


868
01:19:26.163 --> 01:19:28.165
There he is.

869
01:19:28.252 --> 01:19:30.036
- I get the..
- Hey!


870
01:19:30.123 --> 01:19:31.298
- Come on..
- Easy, easy.


871
01:19:35.302 --> 01:19:36.521
'Hank.'

872
01:19:38.262 --> 01:19:39.176
- Hank, you alright?
- Yeah.


873
01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:43.702
It's caught in the tow.

874
01:19:47.445 --> 01:19:48.707
Bring out a sensor.

875
01:19:48.794 --> 01:19:50.535
- A sensor?
- Bring out a sensor.


876
01:19:56.759 --> 01:19:58.456
- Done?
- Yeah.


877
01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:03.766
Alright, send it down easy.

878
01:20:05.506 --> 01:20:06.769
Lower, lower.

879
01:20:21.784 --> 01:20:23.220
- Doug.
- Yes, Craig.


880
01:20:23.307 --> 01:20:24.874
Hank's aboard.
Anchor the sensor.


881
01:20:24.961 --> 01:20:26.702
- What?
- Anchor the sensor.


882
01:20:26.789 --> 01:20:28.921
- What are you talking about?
- Blow it! Just blow it.


883
01:20:29.008 --> 01:20:30.053
Okay, got you.

884
01:20:48.071 --> 01:20:50.247
Hydronaut calling
Seismo, Washington.


885
01:20:50.334 --> 01:20:51.770
Seismo.

886
01:21:03.303 --> 01:21:06.132
Roger, Hydronaut.
Understand, signing off.


887
01:21:08.961 --> 01:21:11.877
They're approaching the location
for the last sensor.


888
01:21:11.964 --> 01:21:14.488
Send for the American.

889
01:21:14.575 --> 01:21:18.057
Reports an earthquake
of 6.5 on the Richter scale.


890
01:21:18.144 --> 01:21:20.407
You'll get a warning
system in time.


891
01:21:20.494 --> 01:21:22.888
Even after they
put the last one down.


892
01:21:22.975 --> 01:21:26.152
- Will the system interlock?
- Well, we'll know soon enough.


893
01:21:26.239 --> 01:21:27.893
Standby on your regional map.

894
01:21:31.636 --> 01:21:33.072
The last one.

895
01:21:33.159 --> 01:21:35.683
Let's give her our
blessing and let it go.


896
01:21:35.771 --> 01:21:39.296
Hank, standby to inform Seismo
as soon as it's anchored.


897
01:21:39.383 --> 01:21:41.602
And if the whole
system works then..


898
01:21:41.689 --> 01:21:43.648
...my dive.

899
01:21:43.735 --> 01:21:45.258
Alright, here she goes.

900
01:21:51.047 --> 01:21:52.309
Anchor it.

901
01:22:05.670 --> 01:22:07.063
Dr. Boren, Dr. Hamaru.

902
01:22:07.150 --> 01:22:09.152
The last sensor's down
and the signal's perfect.


903
01:22:09.239 --> 01:22:10.501
Get me the Hydronaut.

904
01:22:14.157 --> 01:22:15.462
Are all the sub
system's working?


905
01:22:15.549 --> 01:22:17.508
Signal okay. Roger.

906
01:22:17.595 --> 01:22:18.988
- Coming through.
- Fine here.


907
01:22:19.075 --> 01:22:20.250
Okay, check.

908
01:22:21.512 --> 01:22:23.209
Alright, standby
for an interlock.


909
01:22:25.385 --> 01:22:28.127
Well, doctor, this was
your conception.


910
01:22:28.214 --> 01:22:30.042
Or misconception.

911
01:22:34.090 --> 01:22:35.831
It's interlocked.
It's okay.


912
01:22:37.006 --> 01:22:38.485
Call the Hydronaut.

913
01:22:38.572 --> 01:22:40.139
'Hello, Hydronaut.'

914
01:22:40.226 --> 01:22:42.663
'I think if it's closed,
and it works perfectly.'


915
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:45.144
'The system works.
It really, really works.'


916
01:22:45.231 --> 01:22:46.798
We did it!
We did it!


917
01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.933
Great, great.

918
01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:53.936
Hey, gang, guaranteed not
to be over 10 minutes old.


919
01:22:54.023 --> 01:22:57.026
It'll have you gone in 90
seconds without a hangover.


920
01:22:57.113 --> 01:22:59.506
Hey, who is minding the store?
Get back it.


921
01:22:59.593 --> 01:23:01.857
Sure, but gimme time
to try one on.


922
01:24:03.266 --> 01:24:04.832
You know, we never did really

923
01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:07.879
settle on just what
we're playing for.


924
01:24:07.966 --> 01:24:10.447
Anything you say.

925
01:24:10.534 --> 01:24:12.884
Anything?

926
01:24:12.971 --> 01:24:15.669
You don't want to take
a look at that last move?


927
01:24:15.756 --> 01:24:18.498
No, no, no.
You go ahead and name it.


928
01:24:18.585 --> 01:24:20.936
Well, according to an agreement
I have with Douglas here


929
01:24:21.023 --> 01:24:23.851
I need your consent
for a salvage dive.


930
01:24:23.939 --> 01:24:26.463
And I also need
your breathing gas.


931
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:30.032
If I win, you help me.

932
01:24:30.119 --> 01:24:32.425
And if you lose, no dive.

933
01:24:40.694 --> 01:24:42.696
You're checkmate in two moves.

934
01:24:44.785 --> 01:24:46.439
No that's impossible.

935
01:24:49.094 --> 01:24:51.357
Why, because you couldn't
outfox me with that


936
01:24:51.444 --> 01:24:52.968
rat-thing
computer of yours?


937
01:24:56.188 --> 01:24:58.538
Didn't you think
it was wrong to use it?


938
01:24:58.625 --> 01:25:01.541
Wasn't it wrong to piggyback
your treasure dive on this sub?


939
01:25:01.628 --> 01:25:03.195
No.

940
01:25:03.282 --> 01:25:05.110
Then maybe you ought
to ask your computer


941
01:25:05.197 --> 01:25:06.503
whether it's right or wrong?

942
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:08.070
Maybe it'll know
the difference.


943
01:25:08.157 --> 01:25:09.810
Or maybe it'll get
a nervous breakdown


944
01:25:09.897 --> 01:25:11.421
in trying to figure it out.

945
01:25:14.728 --> 01:25:17.688
The computer I used
was conceived by me


946
01:25:17.775 --> 01:25:20.212
designed by me
and engineered by me.


947
01:25:20.299 --> 01:25:22.301
It's merely an electronic
extension of my own mind


948
01:25:22.388 --> 01:25:23.999
I've a perfect right to use.

949
01:25:24.086 --> 01:25:26.653
That makes no difference.
You lost.


950
01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:28.264
No dive.

951
01:25:39.362 --> 01:25:41.059
Using the computer
to figure his moves.


952
01:25:44.541 --> 01:25:47.196
About three weeks ago,
on my night watch..


953
01:25:47.283 --> 01:25:49.676
...I found a teletype
from Washington.


954
01:25:49.763 --> 01:25:51.983
He's getting his information
from some big stupid called


955
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:54.420
MX2NR2.

956
01:25:54.507 --> 01:25:56.205
Does it make any
difference to you


957
01:25:56.292 --> 01:25:58.337
that the big stupid
belongs to him?


958
01:26:00.383 --> 01:26:02.080
That he designed it?

959
01:26:02.167 --> 01:26:04.735
You don't really believe he
designed that thing, do you?


960
01:26:04.822 --> 01:26:06.998
I have seen it.
You think he designed it?


961
01:26:07.085 --> 01:26:09.044
From top to bottom.

962
01:26:11.176 --> 01:26:13.439
- He-he really did?
- Yup.


963
01:26:16.834 --> 01:26:18.836
Takes a real brain
to build one of those.


964
01:26:18.923 --> 01:26:20.446
Mm-hmm.

965
01:26:20.533 --> 01:26:23.014
Real big brain.

966
01:26:23.101 --> 01:26:25.495
But he still felt
he had to cheat to beat me.


967
01:26:27.453 --> 01:26:30.413
Any guy with that much talent,
who wants something that bad


968
01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:32.763
that he feels he has
to cheat to get it.


969
01:26:36.201 --> 01:26:37.463
Hm.

970
01:26:43.991 --> 01:26:46.211
Let the pirate
have his treasure.


971
01:27:06.797 --> 01:27:08.059
Nothing.

972
01:27:09.104 --> 01:27:10.583
Look at this.

973
01:27:16.937 --> 01:27:18.722
Nothing.

974
01:27:18.809 --> 01:27:20.463
'Oh, I'm sure you'll find it.'

975
01:27:26.295 --> 01:27:28.514
That, uh..

976
01:27:28.601 --> 01:27:29.994
Go back. Back, back, back.
Reverse, reverse.


977
01:27:32.736 --> 01:27:34.694
- Phil, you were right.
- There. You're right.


978
01:27:34.781 --> 01:27:37.393
- 'The propeller.'
- 'That's nice.'


979
01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:39.221
Well, what are you waiting for?

980
01:27:41.788 --> 01:27:43.399
I'll give you a hand, Phil.

981
01:28:47.027 --> 01:28:48.638
Good luck, boy

982
01:28:48.725 --> 01:28:51.467
When I come back, we're all
going to be very rich.


983
01:28:51.554 --> 01:28:54.034
- If the stuff is still there.
- Yeah.


984
01:29:02.434 --> 01:29:03.435
Phil's going out.

985
01:29:55.052 --> 01:29:57.272
Dr. Boren.
Dr. Boren, Dr. Hamaru.


986
01:29:59.970 --> 01:30:01.972
- What's happening?
- Must be a malfunction.


987
01:30:02.059 --> 01:30:04.409
'Dr. Boren, there's an
outside call for you.'


988
01:30:04.496 --> 01:30:06.933
Put him on the loudspeaker.

989
01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:09.371
'This is Canal Zone,
Seismic station.'


990
01:30:09.458 --> 01:30:12.722
'We want to relay transmission
from Lufthansa aircraft'


991
01:30:12.809 --> 01:30:16.073
'approximately 250 miles,
south west of Canal Zone.'


992
01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.814
This is Washington.
Go ahead, Lufthansa.


993
01:30:20.295 --> 01:30:21.992
Seems to be an island
in eruption


994
01:30:22.079 --> 01:30:24.690
or an island which
is coming out of the sea.


995
01:30:24.777 --> 01:30:26.344
Heavy formation
of steam clouds.


996
01:30:26.431 --> 01:30:27.867
Black material
thrown up continuously.


997
01:30:27.954 --> 01:30:29.347
Get the Hydronaut.

998
01:30:29.434 --> 01:30:31.088
'There's time for one pass.'

999
01:30:31.175 --> 01:30:34.700
'My position is 130 degrees,

1000
01:30:34.787 --> 01:30:37.312
'11.15, 22 north.'

1001
01:30:37.399 --> 01:30:39.792
Contact the air force.
Nearest base.


1002
01:30:39.879 --> 01:30:41.838
Request reconnaissance.
Televideo if available.


1003
01:30:44.188 --> 01:30:45.232
Hydronaut here.

1004
01:30:48.192 --> 01:30:50.586
- Hydronaut, this is Dr. Boren.
- Oh, hello, Gus. What's up?


1005
01:30:50.673 --> 01:30:53.197
Hi, Doug. There's an underwater
volcanic disturbance


1006
01:30:53.284 --> 01:30:55.068
a 100 miles due, south of you.

1007
01:30:55.155 --> 01:30:57.854
We need an additional
sensor dropped in there.


1008
01:30:57.941 --> 01:31:00.552
How close to the disturbance
you want us to drop it?


1009
01:31:00.639 --> 01:31:01.901
As close as possible.

1010
01:31:01.988 --> 01:31:04.600
We need it to fill
a gap in the grid.


1011
01:31:04.687 --> 01:31:06.819
The volcano is

1012
01:31:06.906 --> 01:31:10.693
- 103 west, 11 north, right?
- 'Right.'


1013
01:31:12.216 --> 01:31:13.957
Okay, Gus.
We'll do our best.


1014
01:31:17.961 --> 01:31:20.790
They're out there.
I was right. I saw them.


1015
01:31:20.877 --> 01:31:22.226
They're out there
by the cage.


1016
01:31:23.183 --> 01:31:25.142
Millions of them.

1017
01:31:25.229 --> 01:31:27.057
I know the market value
of those crystals.


1018
01:31:29.407 --> 01:31:31.714
- Hank, Pill come in yet?
- He just came in.


1019
01:31:31.801 --> 01:31:34.107
Well, lock off the sea hatch.
We're leaving.


1020
01:31:34.194 --> 01:31:35.500
What do you mean
we're leaving?


1021
01:31:35.587 --> 01:31:37.372
What about the salvage?

1022
01:31:47.556 --> 01:31:48.905
Well, there it is, Doug.

1023
01:31:48.992 --> 01:31:51.603
No islands, deep water,
easy access all the way.


1024
01:31:51.690 --> 01:31:53.997
- That's what I figured.
- Why?


1025
01:31:54.084 --> 01:31:55.694
Orders.

1026
01:31:55.781 --> 01:31:58.436
It's there. We just have
to pick up with our hands.


1027
01:31:58.523 --> 01:32:00.612
I'm sorry, Phil.
Washington said now.


1028
01:32:00.699 --> 01:32:03.354
We had a deal, when you planted
the last sensor we...


1029
01:32:03.441 --> 01:32:06.444
It's not the last one,
they want us to put one more.


1030
01:32:06.531 --> 01:32:08.228
We'll lose them.
So many of them.


1031
01:32:08.315 --> 01:32:10.622
We won't. No, I took
a fix on them.


1032
01:32:10.709 --> 01:32:12.798
It'll only take
a couple of hours.


1033
01:32:12.885 --> 01:32:15.148
Later, we'll get
to your crystals later.


1034
01:32:15.235 --> 01:32:17.455
Stations everybody.

1035
01:32:17.542 --> 01:32:18.978
Can't they wait?

1036
01:32:19.065 --> 01:32:21.154
No, it's an underwater volcano.

1037
01:32:26.029 --> 01:32:27.683
Dr. Boren, transmission
from the air force.


1038
01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:30.425
Reconnaissance
plane's coming through.


1039
01:32:30.512 --> 01:32:33.428
'This is air force,
Roger Niner-Two-Niner-Two.'


1040
01:32:33.515 --> 01:32:35.212
'I have your island on camera.'

1041
01:32:35.299 --> 01:32:38.084
'Are you receiving
our transmission? Over.'


1042
01:32:38.171 --> 01:32:41.174
Roger, Air Force Recon.
We have it. Over.


1043
01:32:41.261 --> 01:32:44.264
'My position, a quarter mile
due south of disturbance.'


1044
01:32:44.351 --> 01:32:46.745
'Altitude 1500 feet.'

1045
01:32:46.832 --> 01:32:49.618
'New eruption starting on edge
of older one.'


1046
01:32:49.705 --> 01:32:52.055
'Heavy fall out
of hot ashes.'


1047
01:32:52.142 --> 01:32:55.885
'Estimated height of vapor
clouds, 3500 feet.'


1048
01:32:55.972 --> 01:32:58.540
'Deep underwater,
faint red glow visible.'


1049
01:32:58.627 --> 01:33:00.672
'Estimated depth, 800 feet.'

1050
01:33:00.759 --> 01:33:02.152
Get the Hydronaut.

1051
01:33:04.415 --> 01:33:06.373
We must have a sensor
in that area.


1052
01:33:06.461 --> 01:33:08.593
It's the only way we'll
make a reliable prediction


1053
01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:10.073
on what coastlines
are threatened.


1054
01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:11.901
Tell him to approach the area
with utmost caution.


1055
01:33:25.088 --> 01:33:27.699
And the time to get
that sensor in is now.


1056
01:33:30.746 --> 01:33:32.530
You were right.

1057
01:33:44.542 --> 01:33:48.111
Origin of the shock waves,

1058
01:33:48.198 --> 01:33:49.504
On the bottom of 800 feet.

1059
01:34:14.006 --> 01:34:15.617
It's like a hell itself.

1060
01:34:27.977 --> 01:34:29.587
Orin, what do you think?

1061
01:34:29.674 --> 01:34:31.720
If we got to the sensor
there in about


1062
01:34:31.807 --> 01:34:33.678
three-four hundred yards,
that'll be alright.


1063
01:34:33.765 --> 01:34:36.376
Three or four hundred yards?

1064
01:34:36.463 --> 01:34:37.552
See that shelf over there?

1065
01:34:50.652 --> 01:34:52.523
- I'll take another look at it.
- Yeah.


1066
01:35:32.824 --> 01:35:34.739
I'll get the sensor
ready for the drop.


1067
01:35:43.574 --> 01:35:46.055
Here. Look through these.
They're filtered.


1068
01:35:49.667 --> 01:35:52.017
- Doug, the sensor is ready.
- Okay, drop it.


1069
01:35:52.104 --> 01:35:53.628
Alright, here we go.

1070
01:36:41.545 --> 01:36:42.981
Craig, Craig.

1071
01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:46.071
Phil, Hank, come up forward.

1072
01:37:17.363 --> 01:37:18.843
We're buried.

1073
01:37:21.193 --> 01:37:23.543
Question is..

1074
01:37:23.630 --> 01:37:25.023
How deep?

1075
01:37:29.767 --> 01:37:32.030
Craig, the airlock,
what shape is it in?


1076
01:37:32.117 --> 01:37:34.337
No good at all.
It's all stowed in.


1077
01:37:34.424 --> 01:37:37.383
The breathing gases and the
scuba gear is down there too.


1078
01:37:37.470 --> 01:37:38.820
- Orin.
- Yeah.


1079
01:37:38.907 --> 01:37:40.604
The eruption,
is it growing or dying?


1080
01:37:40.691 --> 01:37:41.823
It's growing.

1081
01:37:43.868 --> 01:37:46.741
Phil, if we do
reach the surface


1082
01:37:46.828 --> 01:37:48.786
we'll have to give them
a fix, can you do it?


1083
01:37:48.873 --> 01:37:52.094
I'll rig up something
to send out a signal.


1084
01:37:52.181 --> 01:37:54.487
How much air we got
left in here?


1085
01:37:54.574 --> 01:37:56.098
Six adults, one hour.

1086
01:37:56.185 --> 01:37:58.143
No, no, no.
We'll need two hours.


1087
01:37:58.230 --> 01:38:01.799
If I can lower metabolic rate,
that might give us two hours.


1088
01:38:01.886 --> 01:38:03.279
- Can you?
- I can try.


1089
01:38:03.366 --> 01:38:05.107
Alright.

1090
01:38:05.194 --> 01:38:07.849
Now, this is what we better do.
There's no other way.


1091
01:38:07.936 --> 01:38:10.895
I'll blow us out of this
rock pile up to the surface.


1092
01:38:10.982 --> 01:38:12.984
Doug, you're gonna
blow this up in half?


1093
01:38:13.071 --> 01:38:16.248
- Can you think any other way?
- No. It's the only way.


1094
01:38:16.335 --> 01:38:18.120
Then get all the plastic
dynamite we've got


1095
01:38:18.207 --> 01:38:19.904
and put it into AFCOM.

1096
01:38:19.991 --> 01:38:21.601
Detonators, primer cords,
the works.


1097
01:38:21.688 --> 01:38:23.603
Others, gather all the
mattresses, pillows, blankets


1098
01:38:23.690 --> 01:38:25.954
anything soft you can find
and bring it here.


1099
01:38:26.041 --> 01:38:27.346
Hurry now, we gotta move fast.

1100
01:38:33.396 --> 01:38:35.050
We're buried from here down.

1101
01:38:35.137 --> 01:38:36.529
Let's not knock 'em.
Grab that axe.


1102
01:38:36.616 --> 01:38:37.835
Alright.

1103
01:38:37.922 --> 01:38:39.097
Go ahead.

1104
01:38:41.447 --> 01:38:43.754
Get rid of that
paddle first, huh?


1105
01:38:54.504 --> 01:38:56.419
Alright, give Craig a hand.

1106
01:38:56.506 --> 01:38:58.856
Get all that dynamite in here
as fast as you can.


1107
01:39:10.650 --> 01:39:12.565
Get four of these
dynamite boxes.


1108
01:39:12.652 --> 01:39:13.697
Okay.

1109
01:39:17.788 --> 01:39:19.790
Alright, move ahead.

1110
01:39:19.877 --> 01:39:21.574
Let me see what
I can salvage here.


1111
01:39:54.172 --> 01:39:56.740
Airlock's underwater.
I salvaged this tank.


1112
01:39:56.827 --> 01:39:58.916
Good boy. This is
not a dynamite, is it?


1113
01:39:59.003 --> 01:40:00.831
- No, there's more coming.
- Alright, hurry up.


1114
01:40:00.918 --> 01:40:02.093
'Alright.'

1115
01:40:19.850 --> 01:40:21.069
Work fast.

1116
01:40:29.251 --> 01:40:30.730
Shape it into corners.

1117
01:40:34.517 --> 01:40:35.953
It's gotta blow out.
Or else..


1118
01:40:51.926 --> 01:40:53.318
Maggie.

1119
01:40:56.234 --> 01:40:58.280
Which leads do I use?

1120
01:40:58.367 --> 01:41:00.630
Take a lead from
the main distributer panel.


1121
01:41:00.717 --> 01:41:02.327
We can ground
it anywhere in here.


1122
01:41:02.414 --> 01:41:03.459
- Got it?
- Yeah.


1123
01:41:03.546 --> 01:41:05.287
Gimme the black one.

1124
01:41:08.986 --> 01:41:09.987
Okay.

1125
01:41:10.074 --> 01:41:11.902
It's no.

1126
01:41:11.989 --> 01:41:13.121
Got it?

1127
01:41:17.734 --> 01:41:19.736
The guinea pigs.
What about the guinea pig?


1128
01:41:19.823 --> 01:41:22.130
Guinea pigs?
Women and men first.


1129
01:41:22.217 --> 01:41:23.653
'Leave every cubic incubator
we've got.'


1130
01:41:26.569 --> 01:41:28.310
Alright, there's a spare
mattress down in the lab.


1131
01:41:36.057 --> 01:41:38.668
Leave it alone. It's gotta do.
Come on, get out here.


1132
01:41:38.755 --> 01:41:40.061
We got no time.

1133
01:41:42.628 --> 01:41:45.544
Phil, We are all set.
How about you?


1134
01:41:45.631 --> 01:41:47.416
- You connected up?
- They are all connected.


1135
01:41:50.854 --> 01:41:52.247
Everybody here,
where's Hank?


1136
01:41:52.334 --> 01:41:53.639
Hank.

1137
01:41:53.726 --> 01:41:55.076
Hank!

1138
01:41:55.163 --> 01:41:57.643
- Hank, get outta there.
- Yeah, I'm coming.


1139
01:41:57.730 --> 01:41:59.471
Get back here, come on.
Come forward.


1140
01:41:59.558 --> 01:42:01.604
- I'm coming.
- Come on up here.


1141
01:42:07.871 --> 01:42:09.873
Get up there.
Get in.


1142
01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:11.092
Hurry. Hurry.

1143
01:42:20.231 --> 01:42:22.886
Mind the wires.
Avoid the explosion.


1144
01:42:22.973 --> 01:42:25.367
- Mind the wires.
- I'll watch 'em, get up there.


1145
01:42:25.454 --> 01:42:26.672
Hurry up.
We haven't time.


1146
01:42:32.374 --> 01:42:34.028
Wrap this stuff around you, now.

1147
01:42:35.812 --> 01:42:37.205
Alright.

1148
01:42:37.292 --> 01:42:40.034
Brace yourselves.
Here goes.


1149
01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:53.003
Anchor up.

1150
01:43:00.141 --> 01:43:01.794
We're not freed.

1151
01:43:09.367 --> 01:43:11.717
No, no, we are not moving.

1152
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:24.165
Hung up on something.

1153
01:43:24.252 --> 01:43:26.602
If we had gone for those
crystals, we'd be rich


1154
01:43:26.689 --> 01:43:27.777
and alive.

1155
01:43:29.779 --> 01:43:31.520
I'm gonna go out there
and cut us lose.


1156
01:43:33.696 --> 01:43:36.002
- Craig, cut us down.
- 'Give him a hand.'


1157
01:43:36.090 --> 01:43:37.482
Yeah.

1158
01:43:42.008 --> 01:43:44.272
- Here.
- What are we doing this for?


1159
01:43:44.359 --> 01:43:46.535
We are gonna have
to equalize the pressure..


1160
01:43:46.622 --> 01:43:47.579
...gradually.

1161
01:43:51.148 --> 01:43:53.019
Hank.

1162
01:43:53.107 --> 01:43:54.412
You're first.

1163
01:43:56.022 --> 01:43:57.111
Hank.

1164
01:43:57.198 --> 01:43:58.460
Did you hear me?

1165
01:43:58.547 --> 01:43:59.548
Yeah.

1166
01:44:03.552 --> 01:44:05.423
Stand by, I'm gonna open it.

1167
01:44:39.675 --> 01:44:41.677
- 'They're not easy.'
- 'Let it out easy.'


1168
01:44:43.722 --> 01:44:46.899
- Orin.
- Yeah, Dough.


1169
01:44:46.986 --> 01:44:48.945
- Give me some flares.
- Okay.


1170
01:44:51.991 --> 01:44:53.645
- 'How many do you want?'
- Two.


1171
01:44:55.299 --> 01:44:56.735
Here you go.

1172
01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.524
Alright, the pressure
is equalized.


1173
01:45:02.611 --> 01:45:04.265
That's as high
as it will go.


1174
01:45:04.352 --> 01:45:06.049
- Should we open it up?
- Open it up.


1175
01:45:12.316 --> 01:45:15.014
Sorry, but I have to take
a little more than my share.


1176
01:45:47.308 --> 01:45:49.005
Alright.

1177
01:45:59.537 --> 01:46:03.237
You said we'd have
a whole lifetime.


1178
01:46:03.324 --> 01:46:05.239
There's not much of
a lifetime left.


1179
01:46:07.241 --> 01:46:09.199
We'll make it.

1180
01:46:09.939 --> 01:46:12.420
We'll make it.

1181
01:46:31.613 --> 01:46:33.528
There's a float.

1182
01:46:33.615 --> 01:46:35.921
Yeah, good.

1183
01:46:41.187 --> 01:46:42.754
Come on, hand me a mask.

1184
01:47:53.999 --> 01:47:55.958
- I got Doug, gimme a hand.
- Yeah.


1185
01:47:56.045 --> 01:47:58.352
'I cut the cables.
We must be rising.'


1186
01:48:14.368 --> 01:48:17.327
Well, the time has come
to show and share the light.


1187
01:48:17.414 --> 01:48:20.156
So there's a crystal for you.

1188
01:48:20.243 --> 01:48:22.506
- One for you.
- Hm.


1189
01:48:22.593 --> 01:48:23.942
- One for you.
- Thank you.


1190
01:48:24.029 --> 01:48:27.032
One for you.

1191
01:48:27.119 --> 01:48:31.559
No, you don't get one. You blew
the bloody submarine in half.


1192
01:48:31.646 --> 01:48:34.388
Well, I'd rather be a poor alive
scientist than a rich dead one.


1193
01:49:00.022 --> 01:49:01.415
Hold on, we are turning over.
