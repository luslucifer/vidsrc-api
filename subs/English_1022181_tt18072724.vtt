[woman sighs]

4
00:00:57.132 --> 00:00:58.891
- How are we gonna do
this without him, Mom?

[delicate orchestral music]

6
00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:06.132
- I know it's hard,
baby, but we're with you.


7
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.098
- Hey.

8
00:01:19.443 --> 00:01:21.684
How are you doing?

9
00:01:21.684 --> 00:01:22.512
- Fine.

10
00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:25.856
- Don't lie to me.

11
00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:26.753
- I'm okay.

12
00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:32.443
- Things are gonna better, okay?

13
00:01:32.443 --> 00:01:33.270
I promise.

14
00:01:34.339 --> 00:01:35.098
- I know.

[anxious instrumental music]

17
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.201
- Love you.

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:52.167
[knocking on door]

19
00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:52.994
Hey.

20
00:01:52.994 --> 00:01:54.236
- Hello.

21
00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:55.132
I'm here to install the
new security system.


22
00:01:55.132 --> 00:01:55.960
- Yeah. Come on in.

23
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.443
- Okay, thank you.

24
00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:38.167
- You have a lot of experience
in our industry, Mr. Meyers.


25
00:02:38.167 --> 00:02:39.029
[Gary chuckles]

26
00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:40.270
- I would say so.

27
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.339
I began as an installer,
my last company,


28
00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:46.443
and I moved up to
IT, so wherever you
need me, I can work.


29
00:02:46.443 --> 00:02:48.270
- I guess it's in
your blood, huh?


30
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.994
- I really love helping
people stay safe.


31
00:02:51.994 --> 00:02:53.684
We're kinda like policemen,
just like my father,


32
00:02:53.684 --> 00:02:55.960
except we're there
before the police.


33
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.029
I think we're the
real first responders.


34
00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:01.925
- What made you
leave your last job?


35
00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:03.753
[Gary sighs]

36
00:03:03.753 --> 00:03:04.994
- That's a good question.

37
00:03:04.994 --> 00:03:06.753
I think just time for a
fresh start, you know?


38
00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:09.512
I was also growing tired
of the winters in Chicago,


39
00:03:09.512 --> 00:03:11.339
and when I was a kid,
we would visit Atlanta.


40
00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:14.477
My grandmother lived here,
and I've just always loved it.


41
00:03:14.477 --> 00:03:18.615
- Well, Gary, you have
everything we're looking for.


42
00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.546
Once we get an all-clear
in the background check,


43
00:03:20.546 --> 00:03:22.787
I feel confident that we
can offer you a position


44
00:03:22.787 --> 00:03:25.822
as a command center operator.

45
00:03:25.822 --> 00:03:28.822
- That would be
wonderful. Thank you.


46
00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:32.856
- Okay, Ms. Greene, almost done.

47
00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:35.581
Just need to mount
the interior cameras,


48
00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:37.201
and they are included with
the smart home package.


49
00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:39.339
- Interior what?

50
00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:40.546
- Yeah, well, you
know, we've got-


51
00:03:40.546 --> 00:03:42.650
- Oh yeah, my friend
Sylvia has them,


52
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.098
and she went out of
town and looked in


53
00:03:45.098 --> 00:03:47.339
and saw 30 teenagers
in her house.


54
00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:48.718
- [Sarah] Mm-hm.

55
00:03:48.718 --> 00:03:50.236
- Granddaughter threw a party.

56
00:03:50.236 --> 00:03:54.994
So Sylvia yelled at him over
the speakers and shut it down.


57
00:03:54.994 --> 00:03:57.718
- Yeah, but I don't
have a teenager.


58
00:03:57.718 --> 00:03:58.546
- Not yet.

59
00:03:59.994 --> 00:04:01.270
- Well, you know, you can
always keep an eye on your son


60
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.650
when he is home
after school too.


61
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.546
[Sarah sighs]

62
00:04:04.546 --> 00:04:06.132
- How exactly do they work?

63
00:04:06.132 --> 00:04:07.581
- I get this a lot.

64
00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:10.167
So, look, they only activate
if the alarm goes off.


65
00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:12.374
The software won't
even allow it.


66
00:04:12.374 --> 00:04:13.856
- I don't know.

67
00:04:13.856 --> 00:04:15.891
- You get an alert if
anyone ever enters your home


68
00:04:15.891 --> 00:04:17.374
with the alarm on,

69
00:04:17.374 --> 00:04:19.581
and the cameras are just a
great deterrent for criminals.


70
00:04:19.581 --> 00:04:21.374
They make it possible
to scare away suspects,


71
00:04:21.374 --> 00:04:24.650
and we can also ID them
and get 'em off the street.


72
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.167
Cameras actually make
neighborhoods safer.


73
00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:29.063
- So it's my civic duty?

74
00:04:29.063 --> 00:04:30.063
- Seems like your mom thinks so.

75
00:04:30.063 --> 00:04:33.098
[anxious instrumental music]

76
00:04:33.098 --> 00:04:36.132
[crickets chirping]

77
00:04:44.787 --> 00:04:46.718
- Don't think just 'cause
you're working day shift


78
00:04:46.718 --> 00:04:48.512
you're not gonna see any action.

79
00:04:48.512 --> 00:04:50.650
Most burglaries take
place during the day,


80
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.063
when the homeowners are away.

81
00:04:54.477 --> 00:04:57.132
Okay, back door gets
kicked in, alarm goes off.


82
00:04:57.132 --> 00:04:58.443
What do you do?

83
00:05:04.615 --> 00:05:06.063
- Identify the company

84
00:05:06.063 --> 00:05:08.201
and then ask the intruder
to identify himself.


85
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:09.581
- Exactly.

86
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:12.891
And what happens when
he doesn't answer?


87
00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:16.891
- Well, in that case, we would
order him to leave the home


88
00:05:16.891 --> 00:05:19.581
and tell him the
police are on the way.


89
00:05:19.581 --> 00:05:21.408
- Okay, let's hear it.

90
00:05:22.925 --> 00:05:23.960
- Hm?

91
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.374
- Scare this guy off, Gary.

92
00:05:26.374 --> 00:05:27.270
- Oh, okay.

93
00:05:28.477 --> 00:05:30.615
[Gary clears throat]

94
00:05:30.615 --> 00:05:32.477
- Safehouse Home Security!

95
00:05:32.477 --> 00:05:34.339
Identify yourself!

96
00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:35.925
Leave the home now!

97
00:05:37.132 --> 00:05:40.098
Police are on the way!
Leave the home now!


98
00:05:40.098 --> 00:05:40.856
- Perfect!

99
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.374
Forceful. Confident.

100
00:05:44.374 --> 00:05:47.408
The guy has no choice but
to run, and that's our goal,


101
00:05:47.408 --> 00:05:50.063
is get the bad guys
outta the house.


102
00:05:50.063 --> 00:05:53.684
[delicate orchestral music]

103
00:05:58.787 --> 00:06:01.098
- No, I'm sick of this crap.

104
00:06:02.546 --> 00:06:03.822
- What's wrong?

105
00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:05.305
- If I have to eat
another damn salad,


106
00:06:05.305 --> 00:06:07.856
I'm gonna strangle somebody.

107
00:06:07.856 --> 00:06:11.029
- I've done that
before. It gets old.


108
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:14.546
- Eat too much salad,
or strangle somebody?


109
00:06:15.546 --> 00:06:17.856
[both laughing]

110
00:06:17.856 --> 00:06:20.477
But it's working, though.
I'm down 15 pounds.


111
00:06:20.477 --> 00:06:21.960
- Wow.
- Mm-hm.


112
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.856
- Good for you.
- Thank you.


113
00:06:23.856 --> 00:06:25.339
Gotta pass that
physical assessment


114
00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:27.374
to get hired by the GSBI.

115
00:06:28.856 --> 00:06:32.753
The Georgia State
Bureau of Investigation.


116
00:06:32.753 --> 00:06:36.925
Yeah. Can't pass that
physical with all it is juicy.


117
00:06:36.925 --> 00:06:39.718
[Gary chuckles]

118
00:06:39.718 --> 00:06:41.270
- So you wanna be an agent?

119
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.063
- No, I am an agent. They
just haven't hired me yet.


120
00:06:44.063 --> 00:06:45.236
- Hm.

121
00:06:45.236 --> 00:06:46.684
My dad was a cop.

122
00:06:47.753 --> 00:06:49.063
- Oh, damn, a cop.

123
00:06:49.063 --> 00:06:50.305
- [Gray] Mm.

124
00:06:50.305 --> 00:06:53.063
- You couldn't do
shit growing up, huh?


125
00:06:53.063 --> 00:06:54.374
- Hm.

126
00:06:54.374 --> 00:06:55.581
I'm Gary.

127
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:58.512
- I know who you
are. The new guy.


128
00:06:58.512 --> 00:06:59.994
- I'm Trina.

129
00:06:59.994 --> 00:07:00.822
The vet.

130
00:07:02.098 --> 00:07:05.132
Seen it all, forgot it,
and seen it all again.


131
00:07:05.132 --> 00:07:06.443
[microwave beeping]

132
00:07:06.443 --> 00:07:09.236
- Well, Trina, if the
GSBI doesn't work out,


133
00:07:09.236 --> 00:07:11.684
you should be a standup.

134
00:07:11.684 --> 00:07:12.960
[Trina chuckles]

135
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.236
- Oh, come on, Kevin!

136
00:07:14.236 --> 00:07:15.822
- Sorry about that.

137
00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:18.891
[Gary sighs]

138
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:22.408
- Yeah, Kevin, kinda ruined
this lunch moment over here.


139
00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:23.581
- Sorry.

140
00:07:23.581 --> 00:07:24.684
- You should be.

141
00:07:24.684 --> 00:07:25.787
- Excuse me?

142
00:07:25.787 --> 00:07:28.132
[low tense music]

143
00:07:28.132 --> 00:07:29.546
- Maybe if you were a
little more considerate,


144
00:07:29.546 --> 00:07:32.477
this place wouldn't
smell like a house fire.


145
00:07:32.477 --> 00:07:35.994
- It's not that serious.
[chuckles anxiously]


146
00:07:35.994 --> 00:07:37.994
- Oh, no, it is that serious.

147
00:07:37.994 --> 00:07:39.994
- Okay, Gary, it's just popcorn.

148
00:07:39.994 --> 00:07:43.753
Just a little popcorn.
Just a little popcorn.


149
00:07:43.753 --> 00:07:45.408
It's okay.

150
00:07:45.408 --> 00:07:46.925
- People are selfish.

151
00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:49.305
You know, I just call
it out when I see it.


152
00:07:49.305 --> 00:07:50.477
- My bad, dog.

153
00:07:50.477 --> 00:07:53.512
- No, no, no. I'm not your dog.

154
00:07:53.512 --> 00:07:54.960
- What is your problem, man?

155
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.408
- It's okay. Just
let it go, Kevin.


156
00:07:56.408 --> 00:07:57.650
Just let it go.

157
00:07:58.925 --> 00:07:59.753
Gary!

158
00:08:01.132 --> 00:08:02.443
Making friends and
influencing people


159
00:08:02.443 --> 00:08:05.167
on your first day
of school, huh?


160
00:08:05.167 --> 00:08:07.994
- You see, Trina, today
he's burning popcorn,


161
00:08:07.994 --> 00:08:09.684
and then one day he's not
paying attention at his desk,


162
00:08:09.684 --> 00:08:13.753
and someone that needs help

00:14:44.029 --> 00:14:46.167
[Sarah laughing]

328
00:14:46.167 --> 00:14:48.167
Wow. Thank you so much.

329
00:14:48.167 --> 00:14:49.408
- [Gary] You're welcome.

330
00:14:49.408 --> 00:14:51.236
- I did not see
this coming today.


331
00:14:51.236 --> 00:14:52.891
It's so great to meet you.

332
00:14:52.891 --> 00:14:55.063
- Nice to meet you.

333
00:14:55.063 --> 00:14:56.994
- I don't know what would've
happened if you didn't answer.


334
00:14:56.994 --> 00:15:00.374
- I'm just happy I
was there to help her.


335
00:15:02.339 --> 00:15:06.201
- Gary, tell us who you are
and what happened that day.


336
00:15:06.201 --> 00:15:07.305
- Sure, sure.

337
00:15:07.305 --> 00:15:08.546
My name's Gary Meyers.

338
00:15:08.546 --> 00:15:09.891
I'm an operator at
Safehouse Security,


339
00:15:09.891 --> 00:15:11.994
and I was at my desk.

340
00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:14.856
It was about 1:30 in the
afternoon and I got an alert


341
00:15:14.856 --> 00:15:18.374
that Ms. Greene's
alarm was going off.


342
00:15:18.374 --> 00:15:20.581
- I don't know what you're
worried about. You're a natural,


343
00:15:20.581 --> 00:15:22.201
The camera loved you.
You gave us every...


344
00:15:22.201 --> 00:15:23.408
It was great.

345
00:15:23.408 --> 00:15:24.822
- Thank you so much
for everything.


346
00:15:24.822 --> 00:15:25.650
- We'll talk to you soon.

347
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:27.201
- Yes. Okay. [chuckles]

348
00:15:27.201 --> 00:15:28.132
Bye.

349
00:15:28.132 --> 00:15:28.960
- [Gary] Hey.

350
00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.822
- Whoa.

351
00:15:29.822 --> 00:15:31.339
[both laughing]

352
00:15:31.339 --> 00:15:32.581
- [Gary] Security guy scares
a hell of you, of course.


353
00:15:32.581 --> 00:15:34.718
- No, no, no. It's
fine. [chuckles]


354
00:15:34.718 --> 00:15:37.787
- I just wanna tell you,
you were great today.


355
00:15:37.787 --> 00:15:39.718
I mean, really captivating.

356
00:15:39.718 --> 00:15:41.546
- Well, so were you, Gary.

357
00:15:41.546 --> 00:15:44.822
And it's so great to
meet you in person.


358
00:15:44.822 --> 00:15:46.132
- Yeah? Not a...

359
00:15:46.132 --> 00:15:46.960
little disappointed?

360
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:47.787
[Sarah chuckles]

361
00:15:47.787 --> 00:15:48.615
- Not at all.

362
00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:51.063
[Gary chuckling]

363
00:15:51.063 --> 00:15:54.615
- You know what was crazy is,
the day you were broken into,


364
00:15:54.615 --> 00:15:56.443
that was my first
day on the job.


365
00:15:56.443 --> 00:15:57.718
- What?

366
00:15:57.718 --> 00:15:58.546
- [Gary] Yeah.

367
00:15:58.546 --> 00:15:59.891
- I'm your first call?

368
00:15:59.891 --> 00:16:01.408
- You were.

369
00:16:01.408 --> 00:16:03.305
- Well, you're a natural.

370
00:16:03.305 --> 00:16:05.925
What were you doing
before Safehouse?


371
00:16:05.925 --> 00:16:07.925
- Security in Chicago,

372
00:16:07.925 --> 00:16:11.270
and then Safehouse recruited
me to be VP of Operations,


373
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.098
which basically means
I spend about a month


374
00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:15.236
in each department, undercover,

375
00:16:15.236 --> 00:16:17.374
and I address what
the company needs.


376
00:16:17.374 --> 00:16:18.270
- Nice.

377
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.960
- Yeah. Don't tell anymore.

378
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.443
- Our secret.

379
00:16:21.443 --> 00:16:22.960
- I'm sorry.

380
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.960
I know you got a lot of
people to say goodbye to,


381
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.167
and I don't wanna hold you up,

382
00:16:25.167 --> 00:16:28.098
but it's really
great meeting you.


383
00:16:28.098 --> 00:16:30.305
- You, too, Gary.

384
00:16:30.305 --> 00:16:33.684
[soft orchestral music]

385
00:16:39.546 --> 00:16:42.512
[crickets chirping]

386
00:16:59.925 --> 00:17:01.994
[typing]

387
00:17:03.201 --> 00:17:05.822
Yeah, that sounds like
a really good idea.


388
00:17:05.822 --> 00:17:08.477
But I'm gonna meet up with
Kelci at Java Den in the morning


389
00:17:08.477 --> 00:17:11.477
and then I need to
go to the office.


390
00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:14.994
Yeah, I have showings also.

391
00:17:14.994 --> 00:17:15.822
[Sarah sighs]

392
00:17:15.822 --> 00:17:17.477
Okay, okay. Yes.

393
00:17:17.477 --> 00:17:19.374
Once an elementary
school principal,


394
00:17:19.374 --> 00:17:22.718
always an elementary
school principal.


395
00:17:22.718 --> 00:17:24.132
Okay. [laughs]

396
00:17:24.132 --> 00:17:25.305
Love you, Mom. Bye.

397
00:17:25.305 --> 00:17:27.339
[tense instrumental music]

398
00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:28.822
- But, you know.

399
00:17:28.822 --> 00:17:30.305
I mean, I'm glad to see
you, and how's Jalen doing?


400
00:17:30.305 --> 00:17:31.684
- He's doing good.
He's doing good.


401
00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:33.029
He's a little, we're
still a little shaken up,


402
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:34.236
but it's fine.

403
00:17:34.236 --> 00:17:35.063
What about...

404
00:17:35.063 --> 00:17:35.891
- Sarah?

405
00:17:36.891 --> 00:17:37.753
- Oh!

406
00:17:37.753 --> 00:17:38.581
[Gary chuckles]

407
00:17:38.581 --> 00:17:39.408
Gary!
- Yeah.


408
00:17:39.408 --> 00:17:40.236
- Hey!

409
00:17:40.236 --> 00:17:41.236
- Good to see you.

410
00:17:41.236 --> 00:17:42.132
- This is my sister, Kelci.

411
00:17:42.132 --> 00:17:43.581
- How you doing, Kelci. Gary.

412
00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:44.753
- Oh.

413
00:17:44.753 --> 00:17:45.512
- I see beauty
runs in the family.


414
00:17:45.512 --> 00:17:46.408
[chuckling]

415
00:17:46.408 --> 00:17:47.925
- Well, it's nice to meet you.

416
00:17:47.925 --> 00:17:49.132
- [Gary] You as well.

417
00:17:49.132 --> 00:17:50.787
And thanks for looking
out for my big sis.


418
00:17:50.787 --> 00:17:52.512
- Very glad I was there to help.

419
00:17:52.512 --> 00:17:53.925
- Us too.

420
00:17:53.925 --> 00:17:55.408
- Yeah, well, I can't
believe I ran into you today.


421
00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:56.581
I'm actually just
grabbing a coffee,


422
00:17:56.581 --> 00:17:58.029
looking at some neighborhoods.

423
00:17:58.029 --> 00:17:59.546
I'm buying a place.

424
00:17:59.546 --> 00:18:01.098
- Oh.

425
00:18:01.098 --> 00:18:05.201
Well, if you need an agent,
that's how I earn my living.


426
00:18:05.201 --> 00:18:06.787
- Really?

427
00:18:06.787 --> 00:18:08.615
I haven't hired anyone yet.

428
00:18:08.615 --> 00:18:10.029
Maybe we could talk
after I'm done looking.


429
00:18:10.029 --> 00:18:11.546
- Sounds great.

430
00:18:11.546 --> 00:18:12.753
- [Gary] Okay.

431
00:18:12.753 --> 00:18:13.270
- [Sarah] Let me
give you my card.


432
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.029
- Yeah.

433
00:18:15.236 --> 00:18:16.581
Great. Yeah.

434
00:18:16.581 --> 00:18:17.960
All right. I'll give you
a shot later this week.


435
00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:18.925
- [Sarah] Okay.

436
00:18:18.925 --> 00:18:19.615
- Nice to meet you, Kelci.

437
00:18:19.615 --> 00:18:20.443
- You too.

438
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.753
He seems nice.

439
00:18:23.753 --> 00:18:25.201
You can get some
coins too. [laughing]


440
00:18:25.201 --> 00:18:26.236
- Exactly. That's
what I'm saying.


441
00:18:26.236 --> 00:18:27.098
Let me get my commission.

442
00:18:27.098 --> 00:18:29.856
[both laughing]

443
00:18:29.856 --> 00:18:33.650
- [Director] Tell us who you
are and what happened that day.


444
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:34.925
- My name's Gary Meyers.

445
00:18:34.925 --> 00:18:36.787
I'm an operator at
Safehouse Security,


446
00:18:36.787 --> 00:18:40.132
and I was at my desk, it was
about 1:30 in the afternoon,


447
00:18:40.132 --> 00:18:41.512
and I got an alert...

448
00:18:41.512 --> 00:18:43.167
- You show like
watching yourself


449
00:18:43.167 --> 00:18:44.960
with that pretty lady
on the commercial, huh?


450
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.615
[anxious instrumental music]

451
00:18:47.615 --> 00:18:48.684
- No.

452
00:18:48.684 --> 00:18:50.098
No, I was just...

453
00:18:51.512 --> 00:18:53.856
seeing what I could do better.

454
00:18:53.856 --> 00:18:55.443
You know.

455
00:18:55.443 --> 00:18:57.305
They're talking about making
me a Safehouse spokesperson.


456
00:18:57.305 --> 00:18:58.270
- Say what?

457
00:19:00.236 --> 00:19:01.167
Oh, you!

458
00:19:01.167 --> 00:19:02.615
You almost got me that time!

459
00:19:02.615 --> 00:19:07.477
I don't know why I
listen to you. [laughing]


460
00:19:08.132 --> 00:19:10.236
[typing]

461
00:19:11.994 --> 00:19:15.132
- Hi, Sarah. I'm
sorry that I'm late.


462
00:19:15.132 --> 00:19:16.684
On the phone with our CEO.

463
00:19:16.684 --> 00:19:19.339
That guy can talk for days,
just on and on and on, so...


464
00:19:19.339 --> 00:19:20.960
- It's not a problem.

465
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.994
You must be so busy learning
how Safehouse operates.


466
00:19:23.994 --> 00:19:26.650
So what department do
you have to go to next?


467
00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:28.512
- What do you mean?

468
00:19:28.512 --> 00:19:29.960
- You know, you said
you have to spend time


469
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.960
in all the departments.

470
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.994
- Yes. I did.

471
00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:35.925
[laughs uncomfortably]

472
00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:36.787
IT is next.

473
00:19:37.684 --> 00:19:39.201
It's not really my thing.

474
00:19:39.201 --> 00:19:41.856
You know, I'm more of
a people person, but...


475
00:19:41.856 --> 00:19:43.029
IT.

476
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:44.581
- So how are you
liking Atlanta so far?


477
00:19:44.581 --> 00:19:45.684
- Loving it.

478
00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:46.925
You know, I've actually
never been here


479
00:19:46.925 --> 00:19:48.443
until they brought
me down to interview,


480
00:19:48.443 --> 00:19:51.098
and I don't have a lot of
family left in Chicago,


481
00:19:51.098 --> 00:19:53.822
and my mom just moved
to a place on the beach


482
00:19:53.822 --> 00:19:55.960
in Sarasota, Florida.

483
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.512
- Wow.

484
00:19:57.512 --> 00:20:00.477
- Yeah, she's a retired school
superintendent of 20 years.


485
00:20:00.477 --> 00:20:01.443
- Wait, what?

486
00:20:01.443 --> 00:20:02.339
- [Gary] Mm.

487
00:20:02.339 --> 00:20:04.615
- So my mom was an educator too.

488
00:20:04.615 --> 00:20:05.960
Elementary school principal.

489
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.822
- Well there you go.

490
00:20:07.822 --> 00:20:09.787
- Teachers' kids. Crazy.

491
00:20:10.994 --> 00:20:12.477
Well, I'm glad things
are working out so far.


492
00:20:12.477 --> 00:20:14.098
- [Gary] Thank you.

493
00:20:14.098 --> 00:20:17.339
- All right, so, tell me what
you're looking for home-wise.


494
00:20:17.339 --> 00:20:20.477
We've got size, budget,
house versus condo.


495
00:20:20.477 --> 00:20:21.787
Lay it on me.

496
00:20:21.787 --> 00:20:23.615
- Yeah, definitely a house,

497
00:20:23.615 --> 00:20:26.029
something renovated but
big enough to grow into,


498
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:27.477
maybe a nice yard.

499
00:20:28.684 --> 00:20:32.098
I can definitely see
myself settling down.


500
00:20:32.098 --> 00:20:33.581
Start up a family.

501
00:20:33.581 --> 00:20:36.167
- Let's get to
know what you want.


502
00:20:36.167 --> 00:20:37.684
- Words to live by.

503
00:20:39.236 --> 00:20:41.650
- Well, I definitely have a
few properties I can show you.


504
00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:43.201
- That's wonderful.

505
00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:47.201
As far as price, I would say
Safehouse pays pretty well,


506
00:20:47.201 --> 00:20:48.684
so $700,000 range.

507
00:20:50.684 --> 00:20:53.546
- Well, I will
pull some listings.


508
00:20:53.546 --> 00:20:55.029
But before I move forward,

509
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:58.063
I'll need to get your
pre-qualification letter.


510
00:20:58.063 --> 00:21:00.063
- Of course, yeah.
Definitely qualified.


511
00:21:00.063 --> 00:21:01.339
- Nice.

512
00:21:01.339 --> 00:21:04.063
Well, I look forward
to receiving it.


513
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.132
- You're really
good at what you do.


514
00:21:07.132 --> 00:21:08.029
[Sarah chuckles]

515
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:09.546
- Thanks.

516
00:21:09.546 --> 00:21:13.098
- I mean the way you
connect with people.


517
00:21:13.098 --> 00:21:15.718
- And so do you, Gary.

518
00:21:15.718 --> 00:21:18.546
- That's why we
make a great team.


519
00:21:19.718 --> 00:21:22.201
I am sorry how we met though.

520
00:21:22.201 --> 00:21:23.374
- Yeah.

521
00:21:23.374 --> 00:21:25.167
You know, the...

522
00:21:25.167 --> 00:21:27.822
The thought of my son
going through life


523
00:21:27.822 --> 00:21:31.891
possibly without either
of his parents, it just...


524
00:21:35.615 --> 00:21:37.098
- He still has you.

525
00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:42.477
- Yeah.

526
00:21:43.546 --> 00:21:44.374
He does.

527
00:21:46.753 --> 00:21:48.305
Well, I hate to rush,

528
00:21:48.305 --> 00:21:50.581
but I have a showing in

529
00:21:50.581 --> 00:21:53.615
so we'll continue this later?

530
00:21:53.615 --> 00:21:54.891
- I look forward to it.

531
00:21:54.891 --> 00:21:55.718
- Okay.

532
00:21:57.615 --> 00:22:00.684
[gentle piano music]

533
00:22:06.443 --> 00:22:08.925
- This place is incredible.

534
00:22:08.925 --> 00:22:11.132
- So I know it's at the
top of your price range,


535
00:22:11.132 --> 00:22:12.891
but it's been on the
market for a little while,


536
00:22:12.891 --> 00:22:14.856
so they may be flexible.

537
00:22:16.305 --> 00:22:18.581
- Well, I'm all
about a good deal.


538
00:22:18.581 --> 00:22:20.925
- Never hurts to make an offer.

539
00:22:20.925 --> 00:22:23.132
- Certainly doesn't.

540
00:22:23.132 --> 00:22:25.925
- Let me show you
the living room.


541
00:22:30.787 --> 00:22:34.029
- Well, I could
get used to this.


542
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:35.753
- It's a pretty view.

543
00:22:37.787 --> 00:22:38.822
- Yes, it is.

544
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:42.374
I really like this one, Sarah.

545
00:22:42.374 --> 00:22:44.029
I mean, I'd like to see
some other to compare,


546
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:47.201
but this is top of the list.

547
00:22:47.201 --> 00:22:49.891
- I'll pull some
more for us to see.


548
00:22:49.891 --> 00:22:53.201
- I'm starving. You wanna
maybe get something to eat?


549
00:22:53.201 --> 00:22:56.684
- I'm sorry, I don't
think I can today,


550
00:22:56.684 --> 00:22:58.822
but maybe some other time?

551
00:22:59.684 --> 00:23:01.615
- Yeah. Sure.

552
00:23:01.615 --> 00:23:02.925
Some other time.

553
00:23:04.477 --> 00:23:08.201
[anxious instrumental music]

554
00:23:15.718 --> 00:23:18.650
[knocking on door]

555
00:23:23.891 --> 00:23:24.856
- Hey, baby.

556
00:23:25.891 --> 00:23:27.960
Hey, Mom.
- It's good to see you.


557
00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.787
- You too.

558
00:23:33.891 --> 00:23:36.270
It's a hundred degrees in here.

559
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:40.339
- Oh, well, chemo makes
my blood thin, I guess.


560
00:23:40.339 --> 00:23:42.063
[Gary coughs]

561
00:23:42.063 --> 00:23:43.512
- How's that going?

562
00:23:43.512 --> 00:23:44.856
- Oh, it's killing
me, but what ain't?


563
00:23:44.856 --> 00:23:48.029
[Gary coughs]

564
00:23:48.029 --> 00:23:50.167
- Jesus, they even allow
you to smoke in here.


565
00:23:50.167 --> 00:23:51.753
[Gary's mom laughs]

566
00:23:51.753 --> 00:23:53.029
- What are they gonna do,
put me out on the street?


567
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:55.753
It'd be an upgrade. [laughs]

568
00:23:55.753 --> 00:23:58.063
Okay, fine. I'll put it out.

569
00:23:59.408 --> 00:24:00.236
There.

570
00:24:02.718 --> 00:24:05.098
[Gary sighs]

571
00:24:06.856 --> 00:24:08.443
- I'm sorry I haven't
been by sooner.


572
00:24:08.443 --> 00:24:09.408
- Oh, well.

573
00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:12.270
Not much to see here.

574
00:24:13.374 --> 00:24:15.201
Makes me miss Chicago.

575
00:24:16.408 --> 00:24:18.891
[Gary scoffs]

576
00:24:20.546 --> 00:24:22.132
- Not me.

577
00:24:22.132 --> 00:24:23.925
- That woman ever press charges?

578
00:24:23.925 --> 00:24:25.408
- Jesus.

579
00:24:25.408 --> 00:24:26.684
- No, not if I left town.

580
00:24:26.684 --> 00:24:28.236
That was the deal.
You know that.


581
00:24:28.236 --> 00:24:29.891
- Ah.

582
00:24:29.891 --> 00:24:32.581
Just like when you
were in high school,


583
00:24:32.581 --> 00:24:35.581
and you almost killed
that poor girl.


584
00:24:35.581 --> 00:24:38.477
I'm always cleaning
up your mess.


585
00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:41.167
You are so much
like your father.


586
00:24:42.718 --> 00:24:47.339
He couldn't beat the devil
outta you, but he'd sure try.


587
00:24:48.339 --> 00:24:50.822
- I didn't almost...

588
00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:53.856
kill that girl, and I
am nothing like him.


589
00:24:53.856 --> 00:24:56.339
- Okay. You tell yourself that.

590
00:24:56.339 --> 00:24:58.960
- I didn't come
here for this shit.


591
00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.787
- Fine.

592
00:25:01.994 --> 00:25:04.994
Are you staying outta trouble?

593
00:25:04.994 --> 00:25:07.236
- Yeah, Mom, I am.

594
00:25:07.236 --> 00:25:08.063
I, uh...

595
00:25:09.132 --> 00:25:09.925
got a really good job.

596
00:25:09.925 --> 00:25:10.753
I, uh...

597
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:13.477
I met a lady.

598
00:25:13.477 --> 00:25:14.684
She's a...

599
00:25:14.684 --> 00:25:16.753
She has a kid. It's nice.

600
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.374
Things are really
working out for us.


601
00:25:19.374 --> 00:25:21.477
We're talkin' about
getting married next year.


602
00:25:21.477 --> 00:25:22.305
- Yeah.

603
00:25:22.305 --> 00:25:23.546
[Gary's mom laughs]

604
00:25:23.546 --> 00:25:26.994
A woman ain't never
kept you outta trouble.


605
00:25:28.132 --> 00:25:30.167
Kinda the opposite, baby.

606
00:25:30.167 --> 00:25:34.994
- Well, it's a different
environment this time.


607
00:25:34.994 --> 00:25:38.374
- Where you are don't
change who you are.


608
00:25:40.167 --> 00:25:42.856
- Except this time,
maybe it does.


609
00:25:45.684 --> 00:25:46.650
- You saw...

610
00:25:47.753 --> 00:25:48.581
so much.

611
00:25:49.856 --> 00:25:51.167
No wonder you...

612
00:25:53.408 --> 00:25:55.994
I should've left your
father when you were young.


613
00:25:55.994 --> 00:25:59.339
I regret that more
than anything.

00:25:59.339 --> 00:26:02.201
You were the
sweetest little baby,


615
00:26:02.201 --> 00:26:04.374
but you didn't stand a chance.

616
00:26:04.374 --> 00:26:07.374
- Christ, please don't do
this shit right now, mom.


617
00:26:07.374 --> 00:26:10.581
- I still can't see
right because of him.


618
00:26:10.581 --> 00:26:12.098
- Well maybe he
wouldn't have hit you


619
00:26:12.098 --> 00:26:16.029
if you shut your fucking
mouth every now and then!


620
00:26:19.305 --> 00:26:20.650
I'm sorry.

621
00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:22.374
- Why do you hate me?

622
00:26:27.098 --> 00:26:29.063
- I don't hate you, Mom.

623
00:26:30.477 --> 00:26:31.546
I don't hate you.

to watch on TV.

- Bye!

his bag around three.

Have fun.

- Hey!

00:27:08.443 --> 00:27:09.201
I didn't know your
little guy played.

- He lives for it.

639

You coach?

640
00:27:12.994 --> 00:27:15.098
- Yep. My daughter's team.

641
00:27:15.098 --> 00:27:16.718
We're not very good, but
we have a lot of fun.

- Yeah, tell it to the parents.

Hey, I don't know if
you're busy tonight,


647
00:27:23.132 --> 00:27:24.718
but I'm meeting some
friends for drinks


648
00:27:24.718 --> 00:27:26.546
at this spot in Edgewood.

649
00:27:26.546 --> 00:27:29.270
Super casual. You
should join us.


650

00:36:26.684 --> 00:36:28.477
and now she's thrown
up like three times.


813
00:36:28.477 --> 00:36:30.477
- Get your rag and a
bucket ready, pops.

[Frank chuckles]

815
00:36:31.305 --> 00:36:32.408
- Yeah. Thanks.

816
00:36:32.408 --> 00:36:33.994
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

817
00:36:33.994 --> 00:36:34.925
[all gasp]

818
00:36:34.925 --> 00:36:36.684
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so...

819
00:36:36.684 --> 00:36:39.132
Hey, you're the lady!

820
00:36:39.132 --> 00:36:40.339
- Yeah.

821
00:36:40.339 --> 00:36:42.684
- I work for
Safehouse. I'm Trina.


822
00:36:42.684 --> 00:36:45.305
I said that's the pretty
lady from the commercial!


823
00:36:45.305 --> 00:36:46.339
- Nice to meet you. I'm Sarah.

824
00:36:46.339 --> 00:36:48.891
- Hey! Nice to meet you too.

825
00:36:48.891 --> 00:36:50.753
Well, hold on. Now you
look familiar as hell.


826
00:36:50.753 --> 00:36:52.546
- Yeah? Frank Cantos.

827
00:36:52.546 --> 00:36:54.270
- Frank? I know you!

828
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.167
I used to play ball with
your sister, Danielle.


829
00:36:56.167 --> 00:36:57.546
You used to come to the games!

830
00:36:57.546 --> 00:36:58.891
- Wait, you went to Brady Hills?

831
00:36:58.891 --> 00:37:00.684
- And you know this!

832
00:37:00.684 --> 00:37:03.063
- I remember you.
Yeah, you could play!


833
00:37:03.063 --> 00:37:04.891
- Just a little point
guard action, you know?


834
00:37:04.891 --> 00:37:06.546
But you can't remember
all of that, you know.


835
00:37:06.546 --> 00:37:09.374
Look, do me a favor.
Tell Danielle I said hey.


836
00:37:09.374 --> 00:37:10.201
- I will.

837
00:37:11.581 --> 00:37:12.753
- Now, I don't know what's
going on right here,


838
00:37:12.753 --> 00:37:14.891
but y'all make a
cute little couple.


839
00:37:14.891 --> 00:37:16.098
Ooh!
[Sarah chuckles]


840
00:37:16.098 --> 00:37:18.201
Y'all cute. Y'all
have a good day, okay?

Okay, the globe?

858

Yeah, no, that sounds amazing.

859

Yeah, let's do it.

have the bread.


864
00:40:40.753 --> 00:40:41.925
I am trying to stay
away from cards.

- What? It's so good!
- Nope. All You.

- Oh.

867
00:40:46.132 --> 00:40:47.546
Wait, what is this?

868
00:40:47.546 --> 00:40:49.236
- Compliments of the
gentleman at the bar.


869
00:40:49.236 --> 00:40:50.063
- What?

870

Oh my God.

871
00:40:54.408 --> 00:40:56.270
- Who's that?

872
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:58.512
- You're about to find out.

873
00:41:03.615 --> 00:41:06.236
- How you doing Sarah?

874
00:41:06.236 --> 00:41:07.063
- Great.

875
00:41:08.408 --> 00:41:09.891
Gary.

876
00:41:09.891 --> 00:41:11.201
- Gary.

877
00:41:11.201 --> 00:41:12.443
- Frank Cantos.
Nice to meet you.


878
00:41:12.443 --> 00:41:14.891
- Nice to meet you,
Frank Cantos. Yeah.


879
00:41:14.891 --> 00:41:16.581
- Gary's from Safehouse.

880
00:41:16.581 --> 00:41:17.960
- Yeah, I saw the commercial.

881
00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:18.787
Good work, man.

882
00:41:18.787 --> 00:41:20.029
- Thank you. Thank you.

883
00:41:20.029 --> 00:41:22.546
Yeah, Sarah and I,
we're kinda like a...


884
00:41:22.546 --> 00:41:25.236
local famous, I think
you would call us, right?


885
00:41:25.236 --> 00:41:26.581
- Hm.

886
00:41:26.581 --> 00:41:29.236
Maybe. [laughs]

887
00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:33.650
- Well, thank you
for the drinks.


888
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:35.029
- Yeah. Thank you, Gary.

889
00:41:35.029 --> 00:41:36.339
Thank you so much.
- You're very welcome.


890
00:41:36.339 --> 00:41:38.994
I saw you two walk
in, and I thought...


891
00:41:38.994 --> 00:41:41.098
that's the least I can do.

892
00:41:41.098 --> 00:41:42.029
- Thanks.

893
00:41:42.029 --> 00:41:43.994
- Did Sarah happen to tell you

894
00:41:43.994 --> 00:41:46.477
that she used to be
my real estate agent?


895
00:41:46.477 --> 00:41:48.305
- No, she did not.

896
00:41:48.305 --> 00:41:49.856
- She didn't?

897
00:41:49.856 --> 00:41:53.443
Frank, I couldn't make up
my damn mind on anything.


898
00:41:54.408 --> 00:41:55.856
I wanted to tell you, though,

899
00:41:55.856 --> 00:42:00.477
I put in a offer today on this
gorgeous place in Midtown.


900
00:42:01.167 --> 00:42:01.994
- Congratulations.

901
00:42:01.994 --> 00:42:03.787
- Thank you.

902
00:42:03.787 --> 00:42:07.512
And when you two walked in, I
thought I owe Sarah a drink,


903
00:42:07.512 --> 00:42:09.650
because she spent so much time

904
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:11.339
and all those hours
helping me find a place,


905
00:42:11.339 --> 00:42:15.201
and then someone else got
that big commission, you know?


906
00:42:15.201 --> 00:42:17.167
- Yeah, well, that's just
how it goes sometimes,


907
00:42:17.167 --> 00:42:18.270
so it's cool.

908
00:42:19.305 --> 00:42:21.650
- [Gary] I guess so. [chuckles]

909
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:24.132
- Well, Gary, thank you
again for the drinks.


910
00:42:24.132 --> 00:42:25.753
We really appreciate it.

911
00:42:25.753 --> 00:42:28.132
- You are welcome, Frank.

912
00:42:28.132 --> 00:42:29.856
What do you do?

913
00:42:29.856 --> 00:42:31.167
- I'm a teacher.

914
00:42:32.753 --> 00:42:33.650
- Wow.

915
00:42:35.063 --> 00:42:36.718
- It's a shame you guys don't
get paid what you deserve.


916
00:42:36.718 --> 00:42:37.546
Don't you agree?

917
00:42:37.546 --> 00:42:39.098
[Frank laughs]

918
00:42:39.098 --> 00:42:41.063
- Yeah, well, I definitely
don't do it for the money.


919
00:42:41.063 --> 00:42:42.512
[Gary snaps fingers]

920
00:42:42.512 --> 00:42:44.374
- That right there.

921
00:42:44.374 --> 00:42:45.546
I need to be more like that.

922
00:42:45.546 --> 00:42:46.994
[Sarah chuckles]

923

[Gary and Sarah chuckling]

924
00:42:48.546 --> 00:42:49.374
- Great.

925
00:42:51.408 --> 00:42:53.650
- Well, Gary, we're about
to dive into our food,


926
00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:55.753
but maybe we'll see
you around town.


927
00:42:55.753 --> 00:42:57.063
- Yeah.

928
00:42:57.063 --> 00:42:58.581
- Absolutely. And
sorry to intrude.


929
00:42:58.581 --> 00:43:00.891
Next time, dinner
is on me though.


930
00:43:00.891 --> 00:43:01.684
- Sure.

931
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:05.856
- You guys have a great night.

932
00:43:05.856 --> 00:43:06.684
Nice to meet you, Frank.

933
00:43:06.684 --> 00:43:08.408
- You too. Same here.

934
00:43:10.891 --> 00:43:12.512
Yeah, he's a little intense.

935
00:43:12.512 --> 00:43:15.581
- A little? [laughs]

936
00:43:24.994 --> 00:43:26.581
- Excuse me, can we
have the check please?


937
00:43:26.581 --> 00:43:28.098
- Oh, no need, sir.

938
00:43:28.098 --> 00:43:30.546
The gentleman that bought your
drinks earlier paid for it.


939
00:43:30.546 --> 00:43:31.477
- Are you sure?

940
00:43:31.477 --> 00:43:34.029
- Very. He left a nice tip too.

941
00:43:37.787 --> 00:43:39.236
- [Sarah] That
was a lot of wine.


942
00:43:39.236 --> 00:43:40.270
- [Frank] Oh, yes, it was.

943
00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:41.270
- Yeah.

944
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:43.098
But, hey, thank you so much.

945
00:43:43.098 --> 00:43:44.891
This was a lot of fun.

946
00:43:46.132 --> 00:43:47.822
[Frank sighs]

947
00:43:47.822 --> 00:43:48.891
- You know, I've been wanting
to hang out with you like this


948
00:43:48.891 --> 00:43:51.063
since ninth grade.

949
00:43:51.063 --> 00:43:52.477
- Yeah right.

950
00:43:52.477 --> 00:43:54.477
You didn't even know
me in the ninth grade.


951
00:43:54.477 --> 00:43:56.891
- Oh, I knew who you were.

952
00:43:56.891 --> 00:43:59.443
You were this pretty...

953
00:43:59.443 --> 00:44:00.270
smart...

954
00:44:01.994 --> 00:44:03.063
quiet girl...

955
00:44:04.443 --> 00:44:06.925
who was secretly a lot of fun.

956
00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.546
- I think you have me confused.

957
00:44:12.408 --> 00:44:13.236
- No.

958
00:44:14.132 --> 00:44:15.960
No confusion here.

- I'll see you later?

- Yes, ma'am.

964

[both laughing]

965
00:44:47.098 --> 00:44:48.512
- Yeah, I got it.

[footsteps approaching]

967
00:44:58.856 --> 00:45:01.167
- [Sarah's Mom] I haven't
seen you glowing like this


968
00:45:01.167 --> 00:45:02.443
in a long time.

969
00:45:03.684 --> 00:45:04.856
- Mom.

970
00:45:04.856 --> 00:45:06.684
- Grinning like a teenager.

971
00:45:06.684 --> 00:45:09.063
[Sarah laughs]

972
00:45:09.063 --> 00:45:11.201
He was a nice boy
in high school.


973
00:45:11.201 --> 00:45:12.684
- He still is.

974
00:45:12.684 --> 00:45:13.615
- Good.

sorry you feel that way.


1134
00:51:40.236 --> 00:51:41.925
Gary's one of our
best employees,


1135
00:51:41.925 --> 00:51:44.098
and I'm sure there's
an explanation.


1136
00:51:44.098 --> 00:51:47.443
I'll get to the bottom
of it. I'll talk to him.


1137
00:51:47.443 --> 00:51:50.891
Can I get your name and
contact information?


1138
00:51:50.891 --> 00:51:51.718
- Sure.

1139
00:51:52.581 --> 00:51:54.305
My name's Sarah Greene.

1140
00:51:54.305 --> 00:51:58.098
The number is [592] 382-1240.

1141
00:51:59.374 --> 00:52:01.236
- Yeah, okay. Got it.

1142
00:52:01.236 --> 00:52:04.201
I'll look into this, and
I'll give you a call back.


1143
00:52:04.201 --> 00:52:06.856
Whatever we need to
do to keep you safe.


1144
00:52:06.856 --> 00:52:07.822
- Thank you.

- Yes, ma'am.

Yeah. [chuckles]

You just got tickets?

I haven't been to
a play in so long.

such a good idea.

then I was out cold, but...

I was tired, but not that tired.

- What?

1192
00:57:22.098 --> 00:57:25.132
- Well, your mom watches a
lot of those true crime shows.

1196
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:32.581
It was the guy at the vineyard.

He tracked the bottle
back to Sarah's house

take advantage of her.

who's been here is Jalen.

have what it takes

to become the new Command

- Since the third grade when
you tried to be my girlfriend?

- Well, I had very bad
taste in men back then.

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:52.546
and walked your very
thin resume into HR?


1269

You did.

- Yes, I did.

1272

And have I ever asked
you for anything?


1273
01:02:59.236 --> 01:03:00.443
- You had me run
a background check


1274
01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:01.408
on that guy who asked
you outta a while back.


1275
01:03:01.408 --> 01:03:03.684
- And ain't you glad I did?

1276
01:03:03.684 --> 01:03:05.753
That guy was shady. Remember?

1277
01:03:05.753 --> 01:03:07.270
- Never date a man named Kash.

1278

- Look, you know that
new guy, Gary Meyers?

Something is up with his ass.

I can't quite put
my finger on it,


1284

but his shit ain't straight.

1285
01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.408
- Isn't he about to
be the assistant-


1286
01:03:25.408 --> 01:03:26.581
- Shh.

- Yes.

He been here two months.
I've been here five years.

They haven't even offered
me a raise in all that time.


1290
01:03:34.822 --> 01:03:36.994
Are you kidding me? I'm
damn good at my job.


1291
01:03:36.994 --> 01:03:38.856
- I know you are.

1292
01:03:38.856 --> 01:03:41.408
- He told me
his dad was a cop.

1293
01:03:41.408 --> 01:03:43.339
Lies, 'cause I looked it up.

His daddy had been in and outta
jail for all kinds of stuff,


1295
01:03:46.305 --> 01:03:49.650
even whooping Gary mama's ass.

1296
01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:52.477
Oh, and the other
day I saw his phone.


1297
01:03:52.477 --> 01:03:55.029
This motherfucker had a
tracking app on his phone.


1298
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.856
Who has that?

1299
01:03:55.856 --> 01:03:57.684
Who, huh? Who?

1300
01:03:57.684 --> 01:03:59.994
He either a spy or a psycho.

1301
01:04:01.512 --> 01:04:03.650
- It sound like you doing
some spyin' on your own.


1302
01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:07.960
- Well, I'm an investigator.
There's a difference.


1303
01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:11.339
Look, I need you to see what
he been doing on company time.


1304
01:04:11.339 --> 01:04:12.615
- You gonna find me a new job

1305
01:04:12.615 --> 01:04:14.167
when they fire me
for doing this?


1306
01:04:14.167 --> 01:04:15.994
- How they gonna fire you and
you wrote all the damn codes?


1307
01:04:15.994 --> 01:04:16.822
Please?

1308
01:04:18.615 --> 01:04:20.925
- Give me his email address.

1309
01:04:22.581 --> 01:04:23.408
- Pow.

1310
01:04:24.581 --> 01:04:25.408
Yes.

[typing]

1312
01:04:27.167 --> 01:04:29.408
- Yeah, Kelci, I just got
back from the hospital.


1313
01:04:29.408 --> 01:04:30.960
- [Kelci] Yeah. 
How's he doing?

1314
01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.098
- He's gonna be okay,
but it's just so scary.


1315
01:04:34.098 --> 01:04:35.029
- [Kelci] So crazy.

1316
01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:36.408
- I feel so bad for him.

[tense orchestral music]

1318
01:04:37.477 --> 01:04:39.891
He could have died, but...

1319
01:04:39.891 --> 01:04:44.374
I don't know, you're just
not safe anywhere these days.


1320
01:05:43.132 --> 01:05:45.581
Breakfast for big boys.

1321
01:05:45.581 --> 01:05:47.236
Just for you.

1322
01:05:47.236 --> 01:05:48.615
Gotta eat it all up, okay?

1323
01:05:48.615 --> 01:05:49.443
- Okay.

1324
01:05:51.408 --> 01:05:54.167
Mom, I heard
something last night,


1325
01:05:54.167 --> 01:05:57.787
and I think I saw
somebody outside my door.


1326
01:05:57.787 --> 01:05:59.270
- You were just dreaming.

1327
01:05:59.270 --> 01:06:00.753
- No, I wasn't.

1328
01:06:00.753 --> 01:06:02.305
- Jalen.

1329
01:06:02.305 --> 01:06:04.305
Honey, it was nothing.

1330
01:06:04.305 --> 01:06:05.581
If somebody were in the house,

1331
01:06:05.581 --> 01:06:08.408
the alarm would've
gone off, okay?


1332
01:06:09.822 --> 01:06:11.581
And don't forget, your grandma's
gonna pick you up today


1333
01:06:11.581 --> 01:06:13.615
after school to take you
to the soccer tournament.


1334
01:06:13.615 --> 01:06:14.443
- Yes, ma'am.

1335
01:06:14.443 --> 01:06:15.787
- Okay.

1336
01:06:15.787 --> 01:06:16.615
Love you.

1337
01:06:21.443 --> 01:06:22.718
- Damn, Gary.

1338
01:06:22.718 --> 01:06:25.615
What'd you do, spend
the night at the club?


1339
01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:26.822
- VIP.

1340
01:06:26.822 --> 01:06:29.063
- Look like you
ain't slept in days.


1341
01:06:29.063 --> 01:06:31.925
- Oh, no, I'm fine.
Just a long night.


1342
01:06:31.925 --> 01:06:33.305
- Okay, well, since
you're such the partier,


1343
01:06:33.305 --> 01:06:34.718
give you your email,

1344
01:06:34.718 --> 01:06:36.546
so I can send you an invite
to my birthday party.


1345
01:06:36.546 --> 01:06:37.374
- Sure.

- Oh, damn, man.

1349
01:07:08.029 --> 01:07:09.339
How you feeling?

1350
01:07:10.546 --> 01:07:12.374
- A little sore,
but it'll be okay.


1351
01:07:12.374 --> 01:07:14.512
- Well, I'm sure the
other guy looks worse.

Sorry, sorry, sorry.

Look, I won't keep you long.

1356
01:07:19.512 --> 01:07:20.787
I just came past to let you know

1357
01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:22.546
I was checking my
security cameras,


1358
01:07:22.546 --> 01:07:25.132
and one of my cameras comes
to end of your driveway,


1359
01:07:25.132 --> 01:07:28.650
and you can see this guy near
the street taking off a mask.


1360
01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:30.374
- Oh.
- Yeah.


1361
01:07:30.374 --> 01:07:33.753
So what I'll do is I'll email
you the link of the footage,


1362
01:07:33.753 --> 01:07:36.546
and maybe we'll show
'em to the police.


1363
01:07:36.546 --> 01:07:38.615
Thanks, Lynne. Yeah,
that will be a big help.


1364
01:07:38.615 --> 01:07:40.201
- Yeah.

1365
01:07:40.201 --> 01:07:41.787
All right, Frank, take care
of yourself, man, all right?


1366
01:07:41.787 --> 01:07:42.615
- [Frank] Yeah.

1367
01:07:42.615 --> 01:07:43.443
- You look horrible.

1368
01:07:43.443 --> 01:07:44.581

Donald, do me a favor
and look him up.


1376
01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:23.718
See what kind of car he drives.

1377
01:08:26.718 --> 01:08:28.581
- [Donald] A black SUV.

1378
01:08:28.581 --> 01:08:30.236
- Of course he does.

1379
01:08:30.236 --> 01:08:31.236
- [Donald] And get this.

1380
01:08:31.236 --> 01:08:32.753
- What?

1381
01:08:32.753 --> 01:08:33.615
- [Donald] This dude hacked
into a Safehouse account


1382
01:08:33.615 --> 01:08:35.098
and created a back door.

1383
01:08:35.098 --> 01:08:37.132
He's been watching her
through the cameras.


1384
01:08:37.132 --> 01:08:38.512
- I knew it.

1385
01:08:38.512 --> 01:08:39.925
- [Donald] He turned
the system off at night


1386
01:08:39.925 --> 01:08:41.512
at least three times.

1387

I think he's going in the
house while she's there.

let me call you back.

but I don't need-

not why I'm calling.

Look, I met you a
couple days ago.

Remember, I ran into you
guys? I'm Danielle's friend.

might sound crazy,

that you might need.

he's gonna do anything crazy.


1404
01:09:41.856 --> 01:09:43.132
- He already has!

1405

- I mean violent!

1406
01:09:44.477 --> 01:09:47.477

her Dan, and the police!

We won't have jobs.

- She's in danger, man!

1412

- We're not gonna do anything
until I speak to management.

- And then it may
already be too late!
