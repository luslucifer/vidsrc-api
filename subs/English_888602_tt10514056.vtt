TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY

2
00:00:24.867 --> 00:00:25.868
Li!

3
00:00:28.287 --> 00:00:29.830
- Good morning.
- Morning.


4
00:00:30.498 --> 00:00:33.042
- Have a bite.
- I'm not hungry.


5
00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:36.879
Breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.


6
00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:39.423
- Okay.
- Come on.


7
00:00:39.507 --> 00:00:41.091
It's too early
for you two to act so lovey-dovey.


8
00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:44.720
Jun!

9
00:00:49.517 --> 00:00:50.935
At least you remembered this time.

10
00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:53.145
It's not funny! 
I just forgot about it.

11
00:00:54.814 --> 00:00:56.899
- Ah, this trick again?
- Go!


12
00:01:01.487 --> 00:01:04.031
- You guys are too slow!
- We'll see.


13
00:01:05.324 --> 00:01:08.452
- Go! Go!
- We're winning!


14
00:01:08.536 --> 00:01:10.287
Come on!

15
00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:11.372
Go!

16
00:01:22.424 --> 00:01:23.425
- Hi.
- Hi.


17
00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.262
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Davis.
- You can call me Daniel.


18
00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:28.430
Are you the assistant they hired?

19
00:01:28.514 --> 00:01:29.807
- Yes, and I'm so grateful...
- Great.


20
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.225
...to have the chance to work with you.

21
00:01:31.308 --> 00:01:33.394
- Yeah.
- I've read so much of your work.


22
00:01:33.477 --> 00:01:36.272
It's really remarkable.
The coverage of '89 in particular.


23
00:01:36.355 --> 00:01:38.190
Uh, no, I don't do
that sort of thing anymore.


24
00:01:38.524 --> 00:01:40.067
Well, the writing was excellent.

25
00:01:41.026 --> 00:01:42.862
I can't tell you how much
I've learned from you already.


26
00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:44.822
- Where'd you park?
- Reading your student interviews


27
00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:47.199
- in particular was so educational...
- What'd you say your name was again?


28
00:01:47.283 --> 00:01:48.742
- Min.
- Min. So nice to meet you.


29
00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:50.703
We'll have plenty of time
to talk about writing later.


30
00:01:50.786 --> 00:01:52.371
But I want to get the hell out
of this airport.


31
00:01:52.454 --> 00:01:54.164
I've been on a plane for 16 hours.

32
00:01:54.248 --> 00:01:56.208
- Of course, of course, this way.
- Yeah. Okay.


33
00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.135
Jun, why haven't you left yet?

34
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.931
You look so pretty today.

35
00:02:11.015 --> 00:02:12.516
I wanted to keep watching.

36
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.603
So sweet all of a sudden.

37
00:02:15.686 --> 00:02:17.938
I can't believe you get up early
every day for this.


38
00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:20.274
What's the point?

39
00:02:20.357 --> 00:02:22.276
It's good for the mind and body.

40
00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:23.402
Let me show you.

41
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.116
Falun Gong has five sets of exercises.

42
00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:31.785
It takes two hours to do them.

43
00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:33.203
That's it?

44
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.249
Well, the movements are easy to learn.
But the key is to follow the principles


45
00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:39.627
of Truth, Compassion, and Tolerance.
That's not so easy.


46
00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:41.545
You think you can handle it?

47
00:02:42.338 --> 00:02:44.298
- Of course.
- Give it a try?


48
00:02:44.381 --> 00:02:47.301
- Okay.
- Let's get started.


49
00:03:11.116 --> 00:03:13.118
FALUN GONG FREE TEACHING

50
00:03:17.748 --> 00:03:18.791
What do you think of this?

51
00:03:20.876 --> 00:03:22.419
Falun Gong?

52
00:03:23.295 --> 00:03:24.797
It's certainly popular.

53
00:03:25.714 --> 00:03:27.675
It seems like everyone
is a practitioner these days.


54
00:03:28.968 --> 00:03:30.010
100 million.

55
00:03:31.345 --> 00:03:34.098
Wow. They have
more members than the Party!


56
00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:49.655
Do something. Secretary Yang
has an important meeting to get to.


57
00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:54.785
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:10.718 --> 00:04:12.261
You! Move up.

59
00:04:12.344 --> 00:04:13.887
Get out of here.

60
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.478
Keep moving.

61
00:04:42.541 --> 00:04:43.834
Are you trying to electrocute me?

62
00:04:44.668 --> 00:04:45.502
Wait.

63
00:04:46.503 --> 00:04:48.047
The results from the beta test are back.

64
00:04:55.012 --> 00:04:57.097
I don't think our system
can produce these results.


65
00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:02.144
Everybody tweaks their data.

66
00:05:02.478 --> 00:05:03.479
No one will be able to tell.

67
00:05:04.146 --> 00:05:05.647
But we are lying.

68
00:05:07.483 --> 00:05:10.235
If we submit the real results,
we won't get the grant.


69
00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:15.240
Now that you're practicing,
you have to be honest.


70
00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:18.494
All right.

71
00:05:20.913 --> 00:05:23.499
Oh, yes!

72
00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:27.169
- I can't eat anything anymore, Mr. Gao!
- Yes.


73
00:05:27.252 --> 00:05:28.462
You're going to feed me to death!

74
00:05:28.545 --> 00:05:30.089
Come on, no, we're just getting started.

75
00:05:30.172 --> 00:05:32.424
I've got ten years to make up for.

76
00:05:32.508 --> 00:05:35.844
I knew I missed this man
for a reason.


77
00:05:39.223 --> 00:05:41.725
I'm just curious.
Why did you take this job?


78
00:05:43.143 --> 00:05:45.229
I think it was
your coverage of June 4th.

79
00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:46.313
Oh.

80
00:05:47.397 --> 00:05:49.066
You stood up for something

81
00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:52.361
and you took a risk to give
a voice to those students.


82
00:05:52.444 --> 00:05:54.113
The student I interviewed was killed.

83
00:05:55.447 --> 00:05:56.281
Did you know that?

84
00:05:57.866 --> 00:05:59.201
I suppose I assumed.

85
00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:02.704
I'm sure to you, right now,
journalism feels like


86
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.458
the most urgent work a person can do.

87
00:06:08.127 --> 00:06:09.211
But the world forgets.

88
00:06:10.295 --> 00:06:11.463
And forgets quickly.

89
00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:19.638
Our lab was denied the grant.

90
00:06:20.764 --> 00:06:23.600
Something wrong with the data, I heard.

91
00:06:24.268 --> 00:06:28.564
You know I am a Falun Gong practitioner.

92
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:30.732
I can't abandon truth
just for convenience.


93
00:06:31.483 --> 00:06:33.318
I have heard rumors.

94
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.324
The higher-ups may take
action against Falun Gong.


95
00:06:40.284 --> 00:06:41.994
You have to be careful.

96
00:06:42.077 --> 00:06:43.328
That's impossible.

97
00:06:43.829 --> 00:06:45.539
The government has been very supportive.

98
00:06:45.622 --> 00:06:46.790
Many Party members practice.

99
00:06:46.874 --> 00:06:48.876
That's exactly the issue.

100
00:06:50.586 --> 00:06:52.588
Falun Gong teaches us
to be a good person.

101
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:54.798
The more people who practice,
the better, right?


102
00:07:00.929 --> 00:07:02.764
Maybe I overreacted.

103
00:07:05.017 --> 00:07:08.604
All right, I'll let you go.

104
00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:11.565
Okay.

105
00:07:42.387 --> 00:07:46.183
It's clearly getting out of control.

106
00:07:46.266 --> 00:07:50.187
Secretary Yang,
the Party is counting on you.


107
00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.863
I pulled an all-nighter.

108
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.868
What's going on?

109
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.164
What happened?

110
00:08:09.248 --> 00:08:10.666
You're so late today.

111
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.544
Dozens of practitioners were
arrested and beaten in Tianjin.


112
00:08:14.628 --> 00:08:15.629
What?

113
00:08:15.712 --> 00:08:17.214
This has to be a misunderstanding.

114
00:08:17.673 --> 00:08:21.468
The Tianjin government
told the practitioners to come to Beijing.


115
00:08:21.551 --> 00:08:23.178
Why come to Beijing?

116
00:08:24.763 --> 00:08:29.101
We should go to the Appeals Office
and file an appeal.


117
00:08:29.184 --> 00:08:31.353
Yes, yes, let's go!

118
00:08:31.436 --> 00:08:33.814
I don't think it's that simple.

119
00:08:34.523 --> 00:08:36.858
My father's unit participated
in the crackdown in '89.


120
00:08:36.942 --> 00:08:40.696
He warned me to stay
away from this sort of thing.


121
00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:42.197
We're good people.

122
00:08:42.281 --> 00:08:44.533
What do we have to worry about?

123
00:08:47.828 --> 00:08:51.164
We want to report the situation
to the Appeals Office.


124
00:08:51.248 --> 00:08:54.042
- Anybody want to go?
- Sure, yes.


125
00:08:54.835 --> 00:08:56.712
Okay. Let's go.

126
00:09:06.555 --> 00:09:08.515
There are so many people.

127
00:09:12.227 --> 00:09:13.812
Let's go to the gate.

128
00:09:27.993 --> 00:09:29.494
This is unbelievable.

129
00:09:31.121 --> 00:09:34.041
This has got to be the largest
demonstration since '89.


130
00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:35.751
So quiet.

131
00:09:37.044 --> 00:09:37.919
Hey!

132
00:09:38.628 --> 00:09:39.755
Come with me.

133
00:09:39.838 --> 00:09:42.049
Wait, wait, no. 
I'm allowed to be here.

134
00:09:42.132 --> 00:09:44.301
Sir, I have a
press pass. A press pass.

135
00:09:44.384 --> 00:09:46.803
- Doesn't matter, come with me now.
- You can't do that.


136
00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:48.180
I have credentials to be here.

137
00:09:51.641 --> 00:09:53.769
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello.


138
00:09:54.186 --> 00:09:56.188
I am from the Appeals Office.

139
00:09:57.689 --> 00:10:00.442
We would like to speak to your organizers.

140
00:10:03.195 --> 00:10:06.156
We have no organizers.
We've all come voluntarily.


141
00:10:06.239 --> 00:10:08.408
Some of you must volunteer.

142
00:10:08.492 --> 00:10:10.410
We cannot speak with all of you.

143
00:10:12.329 --> 00:10:13.372
I will go.

144
00:10:13.455 --> 00:10:14.498
And I.

145
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:17.292
- I will go too.
- I will go too.


146
00:10:17.376 --> 00:10:18.377
I will go too.

147
00:10:19.127 --> 00:10:21.713
Fine. You five, come with me.

148
00:10:23.882 --> 00:10:26.051
Excuse me. Thank you.

149
00:10:34.226 --> 00:10:35.352
Please have a seat.

150
00:10:40.857 --> 00:10:44.945
We're here to find out
about the arrest in Tianjin.


151
00:10:45.737 --> 00:10:48.198
We're looking into this incident.

152
00:10:49.324 --> 00:10:51.410
There might be some misunderstanding...

153
00:11:15.058 --> 00:11:16.560
It's good to see you again, Daniel.

154
00:11:17.436 --> 00:11:19.271
I wasn't sure you'd be back.

155
00:11:19.354 --> 00:11:21.356
Neither was I.

156
00:11:22.566 --> 00:11:24.568
You've been away for a long time, Daniel.

157
00:11:25.318 --> 00:11:26.778
Many things have changed.

158
00:11:27.904 --> 00:11:29.364
Perhaps you have changed, too?

159
00:11:30.115 --> 00:11:32.284
Being hauled into a van

160
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.911
in the middle of the night
and driven to the airport


161
00:11:34.995 --> 00:11:37.247
with no warning
will alter a person's worldview.


162
00:11:37.914 --> 00:11:39.458
But that's in the past.

163
00:11:39.916 --> 00:11:42.878
I came back to work on a book
about traditional Chinese culture.


164
00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:44.629
Our expectations are clear.

165
00:11:45.046 --> 00:11:46.173
You're a guest here.

166
00:11:46.256 --> 00:11:47.632
China is home to me.

167
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:50.802
All the more reason
to highlight its triumphs.


168
00:11:58.143 --> 00:12:00.103
I don't see why
that would be an issue.

169
00:12:06.776 --> 00:12:08.153
Good to have you back.

170
00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.281
Thank you!

171
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.078
Thank you for coming.

172
00:12:17.162 --> 00:12:20.749
Please tell everyone to go home.

173
00:12:20.832 --> 00:12:22.125
Of course.

174
00:12:24.753 --> 00:12:25.629
That's great!

175
00:12:33.386 --> 00:12:37.599
The officials have confirmed
that the government


176
00:12:37.682 --> 00:12:40.101
has never banned any kind of qigong.

177
00:12:40.185 --> 00:12:43.772
And they have assured us
the practitioners will be released.


178
00:12:43.855 --> 00:12:45.357
We can go home now.

179
00:12:57.619 --> 00:12:58.662
Great!

180
00:12:58.745 --> 00:13:00.622
All resolved.

181
00:13:00.705 --> 00:13:02.999
Let's go.

182
00:13:04.084 --> 00:13:06.836
On April 25, 1999

183
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.339
over ten thousand Falun Gong members

184
00:13:09.422 --> 00:13:12.259
besieged the headquarters
of the Chinese Communist Party.


185
00:13:12.342 --> 00:13:15.095
It was a vicious attack against the Party.

186
00:13:15.178 --> 00:13:18.682
They severely interfered
with government operations


187
00:13:18.765 --> 00:13:21.643
and gravely disrupted social order.

188
00:13:21.726 --> 00:13:24.354
This is the most
serious political incident


189
00:13:24.437 --> 00:13:28.400
since the 1989 riots
in Tiananmen Square...


190
00:13:28.483 --> 00:13:29.651
What's going on?

191
00:13:31.903 --> 00:13:33.280
It was a trap.

192
00:13:33.363 --> 00:13:35.240
The government declares

193
00:13:35.323 --> 00:13:36.950
Falun Dafa Association
and Falun Gong illegal.


194
00:13:37.033 --> 00:13:37.909
Wang.

195
00:13:37.993 --> 00:13:39.786
They are officially banned.

196
00:13:39.869 --> 00:13:43.498
CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY
CENTRAL COMMITTEE DIRECTIVE


197
00:13:46.334 --> 00:13:47.544
Get in the car!

198
00:13:47.627 --> 00:13:48.587
Move it!

199
00:13:49.879 --> 00:13:50.797
Hurry up.

200
00:14:05.979 --> 00:14:09.316
- Incredible, isn't it?
- It is...


201
00:14:10.275 --> 00:14:11.943
You seem unsure.

202
00:14:14.487 --> 00:14:17.824
Of course, I support the Party.

203
00:14:18.867 --> 00:14:20.619
I just wonder

204
00:14:20.702 --> 00:14:24.748
if Falun Gong is threatening
enough to warrant all of this.


205
00:14:30.003 --> 00:14:32.631
If Falun Gong wins the people's hearts,

206
00:14:33.548 --> 00:14:35.300
who will be left to follow the Party?

207
00:14:37.844 --> 00:14:39.679
Of course, of course.

208
00:14:42.807 --> 00:14:44.392
Opportunities like this

209
00:14:44.476 --> 00:14:45.644
don't come around often.

210
00:14:49.689 --> 00:14:51.316
It's up to you to
make the most of it.

211
00:15:14.923 --> 00:15:15.799
What's wrong?

212
00:15:16.841 --> 00:15:18.635
Jun? Jun?

213
00:15:21.096 --> 00:15:21.930
Wang.

214
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:24.099
Come in.

215
00:15:42.951 --> 00:15:46.121
Wang, I know you're
under a lot of pressure.


216
00:15:47.288 --> 00:15:49.040
You are a bright star at Tsinghua.

217
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.836
I won't make it difficult for you.

218
00:15:53.628 --> 00:15:54.629
Just sign this.

219
00:15:56.297 --> 00:15:57.465
Nobody needs to know.

220
00:15:58.466 --> 00:16:00.301
All of the trouble will be behind you.

221
00:16:15.483 --> 00:16:17.652
The Ministry of Education
has issued a directive.


222
00:16:17.736 --> 00:16:20.989
Anyone who refuses to denounce
Falun Gong will be expelled.


223
00:16:22.532 --> 00:16:24.492
You are about to complete your PhD.

224
00:16:25.034 --> 00:16:27.662
This is your life.
Think about it carefully.


225
00:16:28.955 --> 00:16:30.749
Everything here...

226
00:16:31.624 --> 00:16:36.004
It's all a lie. "Anti-science,
anti-human, and anti-society..."


227
00:16:36.713 --> 00:16:38.381
"I denounce and condemn Falun Gong."

228
00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:40.633
How can I possibly sign this?

229
00:16:42.719 --> 00:16:45.013
The Party has determined
the nature of Falun Gong.


230
00:16:45.096 --> 00:16:47.807
As a student Party leader,
you of all people should follow the Party.


231
00:16:47.891 --> 00:16:49.434
Secretary, will you tell the truth?

232
00:16:49.934 --> 00:16:54.022
The practitioners in our school, does
anyone fit the portrayal in the media?


233
00:16:54.773 --> 00:16:57.066
You are a Party
member and so am I.

234
00:16:57.942 --> 00:16:59.319
I dare to speak the truth.

235
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:01.696
But you don't!

236
00:17:06.993 --> 00:17:10.663
Wang, who do you
think you are talking to?

237
00:17:13.541 --> 00:17:15.668
Secretary Wu,

238
00:17:17.504 --> 00:17:21.257
could we have a moment alone?

239
00:17:38.942 --> 00:17:39.901
Wang...

240
00:17:43.154 --> 00:17:47.617
...you are the age
my son was when he was killed.


241
00:17:48.785 --> 00:17:49.953
He was exactly like you.

242
00:17:51.412 --> 00:17:52.247
Smart

243
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:54.666
and stubborn.

244
00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:02.549
I...

245
00:18:07.053 --> 00:18:11.099
I regret every day.

246
00:18:11.724 --> 00:18:14.143
He was pushing his bike out the door.

247
00:18:15.436 --> 00:18:18.106
I should have tried harder to stop him.

248
00:18:20.275 --> 00:18:22.694
Even if I had to break his legs

249
00:18:22.777 --> 00:18:24.946
and take care of him
for the rest of his life.


250
00:18:27.282 --> 00:18:28.199
So he was killed...

251
00:18:29.492 --> 00:18:31.828
- ...during the riot...?
- Riot?


252
00:18:31.911 --> 00:18:35.123
It was a peaceful appeal made by students.

253
00:18:35.206 --> 00:18:37.417
They labeled it a riot

254
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.377
and launched a massacre.

255
00:18:40.753 --> 00:18:47.427
Now the Party is using the same
tactic against Falun Gong.


256
00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.138
I...

257
00:18:52.015 --> 00:18:55.143
I don't want to lose another son.

258
00:19:01.649 --> 00:19:03.318
It's just a formality.

259
00:19:04.277 --> 00:19:06.988
Nobody knows what you really believe.

260
00:19:07.822 --> 00:19:09.365
I would know!

261
00:19:09.449 --> 00:19:11.367
You can lie to others,
but you can't lie to yourself.


262
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.543
Bro, you really want
to give up your future?


263
00:19:20.627 --> 00:19:22.962
If we aren't free
to say what we want,

264
00:19:24.172 --> 00:19:25.757
to be who we
are, what is anything worth?

265
00:19:26.841 --> 00:19:28.384
You're so idealistic!

266
00:19:29.093 --> 00:19:31.304
Even if you sacrifice everything,
you are just one person.


267
00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.890
What can you change, alone?

268
00:19:36.392 --> 00:19:37.894
At least I can remain unchanged.

269
00:19:55.078 --> 00:19:57.080
In the late '90s, 
Chinese government

270
00:19:57.163 --> 00:20:02.001
surveys said up to 100 million people
were practicing Falun Gong daily.


271
00:20:02.085 --> 00:20:05.046
Health bills were decreasing,
crime rates were falling,


272
00:20:05.129 --> 00:20:06.798
and morality was rising.

273
00:20:08.091 --> 00:20:11.886
After 50 years of political campaigns
to destroy traditional beliefs...


274
00:20:13.388 --> 00:20:17.225
...any revival of spirituality
was seen as a threat to communist rule.


275
00:20:17.308 --> 00:20:21.020
Falun Gong stood in stark contrast
with communist ideology.


276
00:20:21.104 --> 00:20:22.355
Do you still practice Falun Gong?

277
00:20:24.482 --> 00:20:25.358
Yes.

278
00:20:25.441 --> 00:20:26.275
So it would be very
hard for it to be

279
00:20:26.359 --> 00:20:28.069
tolerated by the CCP.

280
00:20:29.612 --> 00:20:31.447
It is literally life and death

281
00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:34.575
for many of the upper
echelon of the party members


282
00:20:34.659 --> 00:20:38.121
that run China to not let
the Falun Gong stories be told.


283
00:20:41.416 --> 00:20:43.251
Falun Gong has been exemplary

284
00:20:43.334 --> 00:20:47.839
in its response. It has never dealt
with violence in a violent way.


285
00:20:47.922 --> 00:20:53.970
It's always responded with forbearance,
with love with truth, with patience.


286
00:20:54.053 --> 00:20:56.514
And ultimately, that's going to prevail.

287
00:21:54.989 --> 00:21:55.948
This is it then.

288
00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.205
Please, be careful.

289
00:22:02.288 --> 00:22:05.124
You don't always have
to be on the front lines.


290
00:22:06.459 --> 00:22:08.628
It doesn't have to be your battle.

291
00:22:10.213 --> 00:22:15.009
And, don't be forgetful.

292
00:22:20.431 --> 00:22:21.557
Got it.

293
00:22:22.892 --> 00:22:24.352
Take care of yourself.

294
00:22:30.942 --> 00:22:31.859
Xia.

295
00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:39.992
I hope neither of us regrets this.

296
00:23:03.975 --> 00:23:09.355
A man viciously murdered his parents
in Renqiu, Hebei Province.


297
00:23:10.148 --> 00:23:13.734
The murderer turns out to be
a Falun Gong member, Fu Changjiu.


298
00:23:14.402 --> 00:23:15.987
Why did you kill your parents?

299
00:23:17.113 --> 00:23:18.781
When a person lives, he suffers.

300
00:23:19.323 --> 00:23:22.952
As soon as he dies,
there is nothing, which is a blessing.


301
00:23:23.494 --> 00:23:26.539
If I don't kill them, they suffer.

302
00:23:26.622 --> 00:23:30.001
Where did you learn this?

303
00:23:30.084 --> 00:23:31.335
Falun Gong.

304
00:23:32.086 --> 00:23:34.046
I learned from Falun Gong.

305
00:23:36.924 --> 00:23:38.426
We offered to reduce his sentence

306
00:23:39.177 --> 00:23:42.597
from the death penalty to fifteen years.

307
00:23:43.389 --> 00:23:44.765
He was willing to say anything.

308
00:23:54.901 --> 00:23:56.027
Good work.

309
00:24:09.957 --> 00:24:14.754
Your father has arranged
for your transfer to Fudan University.


310
00:24:14.837 --> 00:24:16.631
I don't want to go back to Shanghai.

311
00:24:16.714 --> 00:24:19.425
It's too dangerous here.

312
00:24:19.508 --> 00:24:21.093
This is where my life is.

313
00:24:21.177 --> 00:24:22.511
What about my friends?

314
00:24:23.054 --> 00:24:24.180
What about Wang...

315
00:24:24.263 --> 00:24:26.807
That's enough! 
We are not negotiating.

316
00:24:26.891 --> 00:24:29.977
If you do not come back
to Shanghai, I will cut you off.


317
00:24:30.061 --> 00:24:32.980
I will no longer pay your rent,
or your tuition.


318
00:24:33.064 --> 00:24:34.732
It's up to you.

319
00:25:16.148 --> 00:25:18.109
The number you dialled cannot be

320
00:25:18.192 --> 00:25:20.528
connected, please call again later.

321
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.959
We don't welcome Falun Gong here.

322
00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.933
Three, two, one.

323
00:27:19.313 --> 00:27:20.314
Congratulations!

324
00:27:20.398 --> 00:27:21.690
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


325
00:27:26.946 --> 00:27:29.949
I can't believe you two just got married.

326
00:27:30.032 --> 00:27:31.325
Of course.

327
00:27:31.409 --> 00:27:33.077
She fell right into my trap!

328
00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.495
What?

329
00:27:37.415 --> 00:27:38.249
Wait.

330
00:27:39.291 --> 00:27:40.209
Xia.

331
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:44.380
Don't overthink it.

332
00:27:44.839 --> 00:27:47.800
I think Jun's just busy.

333
00:27:48.884 --> 00:27:51.262
Why mention him? I'm fine.

334
00:27:51.846 --> 00:27:54.473
Look what I brought you.

335
00:27:55.266 --> 00:27:57.101
I wish you a long life
of happiness together.


336
00:27:57.184 --> 00:27:58.769
May your babies come early!

337
00:27:58.853 --> 00:27:59.937
Thank you.

338
00:28:03.023 --> 00:28:03.983
This is...

339
00:28:05.484 --> 00:28:06.861
You actually meant
the part about the babies.


340
00:28:08.529 --> 00:28:10.072
You're the boss, we
will do as you say.

341
00:28:16.412 --> 00:28:17.246
Wait

342
00:28:17.955 --> 00:28:18.789
Yes?

343
00:28:23.043 --> 00:28:24.128
How dare they?

344
00:28:26.172 --> 00:28:27.882
FALUN GONG PRACTITIONER
FU CHANGJIU KILLS PARENTS


345
00:28:27.965 --> 00:28:29.508
And people will believe it.

346
00:28:30.217 --> 00:28:31.177
This is terrible.

347
00:28:32.219 --> 00:28:33.971
The suppression
is only going to get worse.


348
00:28:36.557 --> 00:28:38.559
We have to make sure
people know the truth.


349
00:29:54.009 --> 00:29:58.222
RESTORE THE REPUTATION OF FALUN GONG

350
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:09.108
FALUN DAFA IS GOOD

351
00:30:49.148 --> 00:30:50.065
Stop!

352
00:30:51.275 --> 00:30:52.610
Stop!

353
00:30:55.321 --> 00:30:56.238
Stop!

354
00:30:59.366 --> 00:31:00.242
Stop!

355
00:31:02.202 --> 00:31:04.288
Hey, hey, hey, stop! No photo.

356
00:31:04.371 --> 00:31:07.875
I'm a reporter with Chicago Post.
Chicago Post.


357
00:31:07.958 --> 00:31:10.836
- No photo!
- No photo. No photo. No photo.


358
00:31:13.339 --> 00:31:14.340
Stop!

359
00:31:19.219 --> 00:31:20.095
Stop!

360
00:31:26.226 --> 00:31:27.394
Let go of me!

361
00:32:11.438 --> 00:32:12.773
Who organized this protest?

362
00:32:38.716 --> 00:32:40.926
Please don't do this.

363
00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:50.853
Please don't. Please...

364
00:32:58.986 --> 00:33:03.157
Please don't...

365
00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.960
Please stop. I will tell you everything.

366
00:33:34.188 --> 00:33:38.275
It's Wang Boyu and Li Yueyao.

367
00:34:31.578 --> 00:34:34.248
Pay the balance quickly,

368
00:34:35.082 --> 00:34:36.083
or move out.

369
00:34:36.792 --> 00:34:37.668
Got it.

370
00:34:40.128 --> 00:34:41.171
Thank you.

371
00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:55.686
Have some water.

372
00:34:56.603 --> 00:34:57.521
Thank you.

373
00:34:58.021 --> 00:35:00.148
I can't imagine what Xia
is going through right now.


374
00:35:45.027 --> 00:35:46.737
- Patrick Lane.
- Hey, Patrick.


375
00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.238
Daniel. Secure line?

376
00:35:49.197 --> 00:35:50.407
That doesn't sound good.

377
00:35:53.452 --> 00:35:54.494
We're good on my end.

378
00:35:55.662 --> 00:35:56.705
So, what have you got for me?

379
00:36:01.835 --> 00:36:06.673
I think we need to reconsider
how we cover this Falun Gong. I...


380
00:36:06.757 --> 00:36:08.300
Before you waste
your time trying to pitch it,


381
00:36:08.383 --> 00:36:10.886
people upstairs aren't
going to be too happy if


382
00:36:11.637 --> 00:36:13.764
- if you go rogue on us.
- Yeah, I know. But, Patrick,


383
00:36:13.847 --> 00:36:16.099
why did you get
into this business in the first place?


384
00:36:16.183 --> 00:36:18.101
- Okay? I don't think it was to appease...
- You begged me


385
00:36:18.185 --> 00:36:20.437
to get you back there. 
Whatever it took.

386
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.773
- Yeah, I know, I, I get that, but...
- Do you get it?


387
00:36:22.856 --> 00:36:24.191
Because I feel like

388
00:36:24.274 --> 00:36:27.653
I'm having to remind you
that you spent the last ten years


389
00:36:27.736 --> 00:36:30.280
trying to claw your way back
into the goddam country


390
00:36:30.364 --> 00:36:31.698
- and now it's like...
- Yeah, yeah.


391
00:36:31.782 --> 00:36:33.367
I got it. I said
I got it. I got it.

392
00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:35.410
- Okay.
- So. The regular beat.


393
00:36:35.494 --> 00:36:39.206
How about a piece
on China's efforts to join the WTO?


394
00:36:39.289 --> 00:36:40.624
Okay, talk soon.

395
00:36:45.087 --> 00:36:46.380
Go fuck yourself.

396
00:36:47.172 --> 00:36:49.216
This banner incident has
tarnished the reputation


397
00:36:49.299 --> 00:36:52.594
of Tsinghua University
like nothing before.


398
00:36:53.929 --> 00:36:56.473
We have been asked to carefully review

399
00:36:56.556 --> 00:36:58.141
and reveal anyone
linked to these criminals.


400
00:36:59.685 --> 00:37:00.811
Jun,

401
00:37:00.894 --> 00:37:02.437
please come to the front.

402
00:37:15.701 --> 00:37:17.536
These people are your friends.

403
00:37:18.412 --> 00:37:20.539
I want you to discuss

404
00:37:21.081 --> 00:37:24.042
how they abandoned their studies

405
00:37:24.543 --> 00:37:27.004
after they joined Falun Gong.

406
00:37:41.476 --> 00:37:44.813
Wang was a team leader in our laboratory.

407
00:37:45.522 --> 00:37:47.024
He was always ready to help others.

408
00:37:47.816 --> 00:37:51.486
He studied hard to achieve high grades.

409
00:37:52.446 --> 00:37:54.489
Since his obsession with Falun Gong began,

410
00:37:55.323 --> 00:37:57.159
he was only interested
in "seeking perfection"


411
00:37:57.242 --> 00:38:03.206
and achieving a "higher level,"
which affected his work,


412
00:38:03.999 --> 00:38:06.585
and lead to the detriment
of the entire lab.


413
00:38:07.335 --> 00:38:10.630
When the Party wisely
decided to ban Falun Gong,


414
00:38:10.714 --> 00:38:12.382
Wang refused to repent.

415
00:38:12.466 --> 00:38:13.842
He lost everything.

416
00:38:14.342 --> 00:38:16.178
Including his status at a school

417
00:38:16.678 --> 00:38:19.514
that most are lucky to attend.

418
00:38:19.598 --> 00:38:22.350
He was led astray from his normal life,

419
00:38:22.434 --> 00:38:27.522
step by step,
into the mind control of Falun Gong.


420
00:38:31.026 --> 00:38:32.319
Let me elaborate further.

421
00:38:33.195 --> 00:38:36.031
Wang not only ruined his own future,

422
00:38:36.114 --> 00:38:42.204
he also abetted Li and Xia
in disrupting social order.


423
00:38:43.205 --> 00:38:45.665
Now Xia has been arrested.

424
00:38:47.125 --> 00:38:48.627
Xia was arrested?

425
00:38:49.294 --> 00:38:53.173
Wang and Li will soon be
brought to justice as well.


426
00:38:53.256 --> 00:38:55.217
It is heartbreaking.

427
00:38:55.717 --> 00:39:00.430
Jun, tell us how she used
your relationship


428
00:39:00.514 --> 00:39:02.182
to tempt you to join Falun Gong.

429
00:39:05.185 --> 00:39:06.353
She's not like that.

430
00:39:06.937 --> 00:39:08.814
- What did you say?
- She's not like that.


431
00:39:08.897 --> 00:39:11.691
This university has given you
the opportunity to redeem yourself.


432
00:39:11.775 --> 00:39:14.528
Do you still protect Falun Gong members?

433
00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:19.116
You must denounce her
and expose her crimes,


434
00:39:19.199 --> 00:39:23.161
or you are the same as her.

435
00:39:26.665 --> 00:39:29.376
Secretary,
Xia is nothing like what you said.


436
00:39:30.585 --> 00:39:31.419
Jun!

437
00:39:39.886 --> 00:39:42.222
It's a replica. 
But it's gorgeous.

438
00:39:42.889 --> 00:39:43.890
It's beautiful.

439
00:39:44.391 --> 00:39:46.601
This is really stunning. I love it.

440
00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.399
- You're not gonna buy it?
- No.


441
00:39:53.191 --> 00:39:56.611
If I bought every beautiful piece I saw
I'd be crushed to death by antiques.


442
00:39:57.654 --> 00:40:00.532
Hey, listen, um,
I want to show you this gallery.


443
00:40:00.615 --> 00:40:04.327
It's right around the corner, okay?
Before it closes. There's a piece there...


444
00:40:04.953 --> 00:40:07.247
- Thank you, okay, bye-bye, bye.
- Thank you, bye-bye.


445
00:40:22.095 --> 00:40:23.221
No peeking.

446
00:40:23.597 --> 00:40:24.556
Okay.

447
00:40:26.141 --> 00:40:27.726
Be careful.

448
00:40:28.977 --> 00:40:30.770
- Are you ready?
- Yes.


449
00:40:47.412 --> 00:40:48.538
How did you afford all of this?

450
00:40:50.123 --> 00:40:51.208
I got a job!

451
00:40:56.254 --> 00:40:57.464
I told you, you don't need to worry.

452
00:41:01.134 --> 00:41:02.802
It's not safe over the phone.

453
00:41:02.886 --> 00:41:04.179
Let's talk when we meet.

454
00:41:04.846 --> 00:41:05.722
Okay.

455
00:41:27.077 --> 00:41:28.536
We looked everywhere for Xia.

456
00:41:29.246 --> 00:41:31.289
The police, detention centers...

457
00:41:31.373 --> 00:41:32.791
All the places I could think of.

458
00:41:34.125 --> 00:41:35.710
As soon as they heard Falun Gong,

459
00:41:35.794 --> 00:41:38.964
they either hung up immediately
or repeated the propaganda.


460
00:41:45.637 --> 00:41:47.264
I want to hang banners with you.

461
00:41:48.265 --> 00:41:50.517
It's too risky now.

462
00:41:51.184 --> 00:41:52.560
What can we do, then?

463
00:41:53.061 --> 00:41:55.230
We can't just sit by
and watch everyone be lied to.


464
00:41:58.942 --> 00:41:59.943
What about flyers?

465
00:42:00.819 --> 00:42:03.446
We could hand deliver them
and reach more people.


466
00:42:06.825 --> 00:42:07.951
Li?

467
00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:12.372
Li? Are you all right?

468
00:42:14.457 --> 00:42:16.084
Are you all right?

469
00:42:17.002 --> 00:42:17.877
I'm fine.

470
00:43:28.448 --> 00:43:29.407
Breathe...

471
00:43:59.062 --> 00:44:00.063
Wait.

472
00:44:04.776 --> 00:44:05.944
Thank you.

473
00:44:15.286 --> 00:44:17.163
Who are you? What are you doing?

474
00:44:18.706 --> 00:44:20.542
Is your refrigerator broken?

475
00:44:20.625 --> 00:44:21.793
No.

476
00:44:23.336 --> 00:44:25.839
This is Unit 301, #18?

477
00:44:26.673 --> 00:44:29.467
This is #16. #18 is over there.

478
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:31.719
Sorry. Wrong place, then.

479
00:44:40.728 --> 00:44:41.813
Falun Gong!

480
00:44:42.814 --> 00:44:43.857
This man is Falun Gong!

481
00:44:44.774 --> 00:44:45.942
This man is Falun Gong!

482
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:59.038
Hello, I need four boxes of paper.

483
00:45:00.498 --> 00:45:02.041
You've got a cruel boss

484
00:45:02.125 --> 00:45:04.627
for sending a woman
in your condition on an errand like this.


485
00:45:06.004 --> 00:45:08.423
It's okay.
I have nothing to do at home anyway.


486
00:45:09.048 --> 00:45:11.759
How should I write
the invoice for your company?


487
00:45:12.802 --> 00:45:14.679
I don't need one. 
I'll be paying cash.

488
00:45:15.305 --> 00:45:17.098
Of course.

489
00:45:17.932 --> 00:45:20.560
Can you wait here?
I'll get what you need from the warehouse.


490
00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:21.936
Thank you.

491
00:45:40.747 --> 00:45:42.540
NOTICE OF ASSISTED INVESTIGATION

492
00:46:07.482 --> 00:46:08.483
Backdoor!

493
00:46:13.321 --> 00:46:15.532
- Hospital. Hurry up!
- No problem!


494
00:46:35.969 --> 00:46:36.803
Get to your mailbox?

495
00:46:38.429 --> 00:46:39.305
No, no.

496
00:46:39.847 --> 00:46:41.724
I forgot something.

497
00:46:58.241 --> 00:46:59.075
Wang!

498
00:46:59.576 --> 00:47:00.410
Dad!

499
00:47:01.119 --> 00:47:02.120
Where have you been?

500
00:47:03.871 --> 00:47:04.706
I was...

501
00:47:05.999 --> 00:47:09.210
- I'm so sorry...
- You put your pregnant wife in danger.


502
00:47:09.294 --> 00:47:10.712
I entrusted my daughter to you.

503
00:47:10.795 --> 00:47:13.089
You cannot treat her like this.

504
00:47:13.172 --> 00:47:16.509
I had to pull some strings
just to get her into this hospital safely.


505
00:47:16.593 --> 00:47:18.303
Hoping the police won't show up.

506
00:47:21.723 --> 00:47:23.474
I'm so, so sorry I was late.

507
00:47:27.854 --> 00:47:28.688
Mom,

508
00:47:29.647 --> 00:47:30.898
can you hold her?

509
00:47:55.298 --> 00:47:56.132
Li,

510
00:47:57.383 --> 00:47:58.217
I'm so sorry.

511
00:47:59.969 --> 00:48:01.471
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

512
00:48:06.643 --> 00:48:07.518
I'm so sorry.

513
00:48:09.354 --> 00:48:12.231
I thought something happened to you.

514
00:48:13.232 --> 00:48:14.067
I know.

515
00:48:16.235 --> 00:48:17.654
I'm very sorry.

516
00:48:19.405 --> 00:48:22.659
Let's not do something like this again.

517
00:48:23.409 --> 00:48:24.535
Okay?

518
00:48:29.999 --> 00:48:30.833
I know.

519
00:48:44.972 --> 00:48:46.057
Min!

520
00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.101
Hank, Susan, this is Min.

521
00:48:48.184 --> 00:48:50.269
Best assistant I've ever had.

522
00:48:50.353 --> 00:48:53.523
- Oh, this is for me?
- Yes, but you should open it later...


523
00:48:53.606 --> 00:48:55.983
No, no, no.

524
00:48:56.359 --> 00:48:57.694
- Open this now.
- Okay.


525
00:49:00.321 --> 00:49:01.572
What could this be?

526
00:49:04.033 --> 00:49:05.368
Oh, my god!

527
00:49:05.451 --> 00:49:06.661
You went back for this?

528
00:49:08.329 --> 00:49:09.372
Min!

529
00:49:09.956 --> 00:49:14.794
- Happy birthday!
- This is so thoughtful. I, I...


530
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:18.548
Well, you did just say
I'm the best assistant you've ever had...


531
00:49:18.631 --> 00:49:21.926
Forget about me being your boss,
I mean, this is...


532
00:49:25.805 --> 00:49:27.932
This is the nicest gift
I've received in a long time.


533
00:49:29.851 --> 00:49:31.394
Come here. Come here.

534
00:49:31.477 --> 00:49:33.980
Hey guys, Min is a,
an emerging journalist.


535
00:49:34.063 --> 00:49:36.232
- Hank and Susan work for CNN.
- Hi.


536
00:49:36.315 --> 00:49:38.276
- Hi, Min.
- Very good to meet you.


537
00:49:42.613 --> 00:49:43.489
Wang.

538
00:49:56.461 --> 00:49:58.337
Wind speed is 7 km/h at 258 degrees.

539
00:49:58.796 --> 00:50:00.548
Speed at 7.

540
00:50:00.631 --> 00:50:02.258
258.

541
00:50:06.262 --> 00:50:07.221
38!

542
00:50:58.147 --> 00:50:59.148
Fly high!

543
00:51:15.414 --> 00:51:16.332
What's that?

544
00:51:46.112 --> 00:51:47.780
Look at this. Look at this.

545
00:51:49.073 --> 00:51:53.870
"Fu Changjiu has never had
any affiliation with Falun Gong.


546
00:51:53.953 --> 00:51:58.541
Furthermore, our practice vehemently
prohibits killing of any kind."


547
00:51:59.917 --> 00:52:01.544
I told you this was all propaganda!

548
00:52:02.086 --> 00:52:03.963
Of course they would deny his involvement.

549
00:52:04.046 --> 00:52:05.506
Who wants to be associated with murder?

550
00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:08.134
Nobody risks their lives to lie.

551
00:52:08.718 --> 00:52:10.386
We've got to talk to this guy.

552
00:52:10.803 --> 00:52:11.804
What are you gonna do?

553
00:52:12.305 --> 00:52:14.181
Walk into the prison
and demand to see him?


554
00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:16.976
No.

555
00:52:17.476 --> 00:52:18.311
I'm not.

556
00:52:20.313 --> 00:52:23.274
THE WHOLE NATION IS
AGAINST HERETICAL RELIGIONS


557
00:52:24.275 --> 00:52:27.445
We're very impressed
with your efforts, Secretary Yang.


558
00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:31.032
We feared you were up against too much.

559
00:52:31.115 --> 00:52:33.034
I'm glad you proved us wrong.

560
00:52:33.534 --> 00:52:35.745
Thank you, leaders, for your trust.

561
00:52:40.458 --> 00:52:43.085
Excuse me, but there are
Falun Gong flyers falling from the sky.


562
00:53:21.374 --> 00:53:23.250
- Relative's name?
- Fu Changjiu.


563
00:53:28.923 --> 00:53:30.967
Fu was executed.

564
00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:33.177
- What?
- No one contacted you?


565
00:53:34.637 --> 00:53:36.347
I thought he was given fifteen years?

566
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:37.890
There was probably a retrial.

567
00:53:45.606 --> 00:53:46.691
Get Zhu.

568
00:53:47.733 --> 00:53:48.651
Yes, sir.

569
00:53:51.195 --> 00:53:54.323
Director Zhu,
he needs to see you right away.


570
00:53:55.199 --> 00:53:56.742
Yes.

571
00:55:18.908 --> 00:55:21.535
January 23, 2001,

572
00:55:21.619 --> 00:55:23.537
is the Chinese New Year's Eve.

573
00:55:24.246 --> 00:55:28.667
Two self-immolations occurred
near the People's Heroes Monument.


574
00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:32.088
One person died at the scene
and four people were burned.


575
00:55:32.171 --> 00:55:37.384
Two others were stopped by police.

576
00:55:37.468 --> 00:55:40.262
They are all Falun Gong
practitioners from Kaifeng city.


577
00:55:41.597 --> 00:55:45.518
The person who died is Liu Chunling.
In order to ascend to heaven,


578
00:55:45.601 --> 00:55:49.146
they were willing to give up their lives.

579
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:50.606
It's nonsense!

580
00:55:52.274 --> 00:55:54.777
All that work we did,
trying to change people's minds?


581
00:55:56.529 --> 00:55:58.781
What is going on?

582
00:55:58.864 --> 00:56:00.241
You wouldn't be doing this.

583
00:56:00.324 --> 00:56:03.202
Mom, suicide is a sin.

584
00:56:03.285 --> 00:56:04.995
How can you believe this?

585
00:56:07.623 --> 00:56:09.250
Who are they?

586
00:56:09.333 --> 00:56:11.168
It has been proven that Falun Gong harms

587
00:56:11.252 --> 00:56:12.962
lives and endangers society.

588
00:56:13.045 --> 00:56:16.423
For the sake of people's
peace and society's peace,


589
00:56:16.507 --> 00:56:18.217
It must be resolutely eradicated.

590
00:56:19.051 --> 00:56:20.427
It must be resolutely eradicated...

591
00:56:20.511 --> 00:56:21.929
...resolutely eradicated.

592
00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:26.725
We interviewed the organizer
of the self-immolation, Liu Fang.


593
00:56:26.809 --> 00:56:29.228
The self-immolation
was for ascension to heaven.


594
00:56:29.687 --> 00:56:31.730
Why didn't you light yourself?

595
00:56:31.814 --> 00:56:35.943
As they were burning, I wondered
why they did not ascend to heaven.


596
00:56:36.026 --> 00:56:37.736
Later, I figured it out.

597
00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:40.406
Because their practice hadn't
reached the highest level,


598
00:56:41.657 --> 00:56:44.285
they couldn't ascend.

599
00:56:47.371 --> 00:56:50.749
The Chinese government's ban of Falun Gong

600
00:56:50.833 --> 00:56:53.002
has been warmly embraced
by the general public.


601
00:57:04.889 --> 00:57:06.599
This unit!

602
00:57:12.688 --> 00:57:14.648
Why am I under arrest?
I did nothing wrong...


603
00:57:14.732 --> 00:57:15.983
Shut up. Move it.

604
00:57:16.066 --> 00:57:17.026
Hurry up.

605
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:18.777
They are Falun Gong.

606
00:57:18.861 --> 00:57:20.487
They deserve it.

607
00:57:45.512 --> 00:57:48.182
The woman who died is from Kaifeng,

608
00:57:48.265 --> 00:57:50.893
a Falun Gong member, named Liu Chunling.

609
00:57:50.976 --> 00:57:53.604
The black smoke rising
from her can be clearly seen


610
00:57:53.687 --> 00:57:55.439
on this footage captured by CNN.

611
00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:58.359
They said they got this footage from CNN.

612
00:57:59.193 --> 00:58:00.444
That's not hard to confirm.

613
00:58:08.285 --> 00:58:10.246
- Daniel?
- Hey, Susan. Congratulations!


614
00:58:10.329 --> 00:58:13.499
That's a hell of a shot Hank got,
I've been watching it on the news all day.


615
00:58:13.582 --> 00:58:14.875
That's not our shot, Daniel.

616
00:58:15.501 --> 00:58:17.378
We were arrested
as soon as the fire began.


617
00:58:17.461 --> 00:58:21.548
We have no idea where it came from.
But no one at CNN shot that footage.


618
00:58:22.091 --> 00:58:24.510
I think they just wanted us
to catch a glimpse.


619
00:58:24.593 --> 00:58:25.594
Just enough

620
00:58:25.678 --> 00:58:28.430
to prove it happened.
Anyway, about to shoot.


621
00:58:28.514 --> 00:58:30.849
- I got to go.
- Okay, yeah. All right, take care.


622
00:58:32.059 --> 00:58:33.269
Who shot the tape?

623
00:58:34.853 --> 00:58:37.314
It's obviously a handheld camera,

624
00:58:37.398 --> 00:58:39.066
close enough to pick up his words.

625
00:58:39.149 --> 00:58:41.694
But how were they right
there when it happened?


626
00:58:42.278 --> 00:58:44.655
Unless they knew it was going to happen.

627
00:58:45.197 --> 00:58:47.324
I think we should be
cautious pushing this, Daniel.


628
00:58:47.408 --> 00:58:49.285
Or even worse, they set it up.

629
00:58:49.952 --> 00:58:51.912
This could mean
that the government is conducting


630
00:58:51.996 --> 00:58:54.081
one of the largest-scale
propaganda campaigns in history.


631
00:58:54.164 --> 00:58:55.374
You just want to ignore it?

632
00:58:56.875 --> 00:58:58.460
What happened
to "standing up for what's right"?


633
00:58:58.544 --> 00:59:01.338
Why are you so adamant
about bringing trouble onto yourself?


634
00:59:04.049 --> 00:59:06.176
People are being hurt,

635
00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:08.304
they're being killed,
they're being jailed.


636
00:59:08.846 --> 00:59:10.889
If we don't act,

637
00:59:10.973 --> 00:59:14.059
if journalism isn't for this,
then what's the point of doing it at all?


638
00:59:14.143 --> 00:59:16.228
But what if you get kicked out again?

639
00:59:16.729 --> 00:59:18.063
What if you never come back?

640
00:59:20.065 --> 00:59:24.653
Sometimes you have to compromise things
you believe in to protect yourself.


641
00:59:29.116 --> 00:59:29.992
Min.

642
00:59:35.456 --> 00:59:36.874
How many times do we need

643
00:59:36.957 --> 00:59:38.334
to go over this, Daniel?

644
00:59:38.417 --> 00:59:42.046
- This is not worth the risk.
- These people,


645
00:59:42.129 --> 00:59:44.882
I cannot sit by
and watch them be manipulated


646
00:59:44.965 --> 00:59:47.051
- into turning against each other...
- Daniel!


647
00:59:47.134 --> 00:59:48.594
Take a deep breath.

648
00:59:48.969 --> 00:59:51.055
Look at this situation logically, okay?

649
00:59:51.138 --> 00:59:53.390
- I...
- You can't blow up your reputation there.


650
00:59:53.474 --> 00:59:55.476
Who could you help
if you get kicked out again?


651
00:59:56.101 --> 00:59:57.227
Be smart, okay?

652
00:59:57.686 --> 01:00:00.397
- What's the smart thing to do here?
- Well, I...


653
01:00:00.481 --> 01:00:02.024
Oh, shit!

654
01:00:02.816 --> 01:00:03.901
Dan.

655
01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:05.778
Are you there?

656
01:00:06.987 --> 01:00:08.489
Oh, God.

657
01:00:08.572 --> 01:00:09.448
Dan.

658
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.866
Did I lose you?

659
01:00:12.826 --> 01:00:15.037
- Dan!
- No, no, I'm still here.


660
01:00:15.662 --> 01:00:17.456
Just thinking.

661
01:00:23.295 --> 01:00:24.463
Sorry, Pat.

662
01:00:24.546 --> 01:00:27.508
I just dropped my favorite teapot.
Damn it.


663
01:00:28.217 --> 01:00:29.385
Hang on a second.

664
01:00:31.053 --> 01:00:32.554
Yeah, you know what?

665
01:00:32.638 --> 01:00:35.891
You're right. I've got

666
01:00:35.974 --> 01:00:39.269
my book to focus on,
and building my career.


667
01:00:39.353 --> 01:00:43.690
What's the point of getting involved
in something I'm not concerned with.


668
01:00:44.024 --> 01:00:45.275
I'm happy to hear that.

669
01:00:45.609 --> 01:00:48.278
Why not take a trip or something?

670
01:00:48.362 --> 01:00:50.114
- Relax.
- Yeah.


671
01:00:51.615 --> 01:00:52.741
Talk later.

672
01:01:25.524 --> 01:01:26.817
What are you looking for?

673
01:01:27.985 --> 01:01:29.528
Invoices, for taxes.

674
01:01:30.487 --> 01:01:31.947
Right where they've always been.

675
01:01:38.871 --> 01:01:39.746
Ha!

676
01:01:41.457 --> 01:01:43.542
You know, I was thinking
about getting out of town.


677
01:01:44.251 --> 01:01:46.587
Maybe visiting some historical cities.

678
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:47.796
For the book.

679
01:01:48.505 --> 01:01:50.424
That's a good idea. Xi'an?

680
01:01:50.507 --> 01:01:52.468
Lesser known places, maybe.

681
01:01:52.968 --> 01:01:54.136
Ones that aren't written about.

682
01:01:54.928 --> 01:01:57.222
Right. Maybe Luoyang?

683
01:01:57.306 --> 01:02:00.267
It's known as the region
where Chinese civilization originated.


684
01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:01.894
I was hoping for somewhere
known for its food.


685
01:02:01.977 --> 01:02:05.355
- What do you think?
- Of course you are. Maybe Kaifeng?


686
01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:07.774
It's not far from Luoyang.

687
01:02:08.233 --> 01:02:09.735
Two for the price of one.

688
01:02:10.319 --> 01:02:11.153
Sold.

689
01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:13.697
- You'll book the tickets?
- Of course.


690
01:02:35.093 --> 01:02:37.513
You missed your report yesterday.

691
01:02:38.347 --> 01:02:41.058
Nothing important happened,
really, we just...


692
01:02:41.141 --> 01:02:44.436
It's not for you to decide
what is important or not.


693
01:02:46.021 --> 01:02:49.525
Do I need to remind you
what the consequences are?


694
01:02:52.236 --> 01:02:55.864
I'll be charged for being an accomplice

695
01:02:55.948 --> 01:02:57.574
if Daniel endangers national security.

696
01:02:58.992 --> 01:03:00.035
That's right.

697
01:03:01.203 --> 01:03:02.120
So tell me,

698
01:03:03.205 --> 01:03:07.125
what unimportant things happened today?

699
01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:12.422
He left for a trip.
To Luoyang and Kaifeng.


700
01:03:13.632 --> 01:03:15.175
Why Kaifeng?

701
01:03:16.593 --> 01:03:18.136
I suggested it.

702
01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:19.888
He asked for ancient cities.

703
01:03:31.316 --> 01:03:33.110
Send someone to Kaifeng.

704
01:03:37.155 --> 01:03:38.240
Enjoy your meal.

705
01:03:40.284 --> 01:03:41.868
Hi, your meal is ready.

706
01:03:44.830 --> 01:03:46.123
Hello.

707
01:03:46.206 --> 01:03:50.752
I want this, this and this.

708
01:03:50.836 --> 01:03:53.213
These foreigners... Why?

709
01:04:02.222 --> 01:04:03.765
Do you know her?

710
01:04:05.392 --> 01:04:08.228
Yes. Liu Chunling.

711
01:04:08.312 --> 01:04:10.230
She lived nearby.

712
01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:12.274
Had you ever known
her to practice Falun Gong?


713
01:04:12.357 --> 01:04:13.984
No, no.

714
01:04:14.067 --> 01:04:16.111
She is a prostitute in a night club.

715
01:04:16.194 --> 01:04:17.404
Really?

716
01:04:17.487 --> 01:04:18.697
Of course.

717
01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:20.782
You don't believe me? Ask Sun.

718
01:04:20.866 --> 01:04:22.993
They've been neighbors for years.

719
01:04:25.996 --> 01:04:27.706
Ah, Liu Chunling!

720
01:04:28.206 --> 01:04:30.959
She is sick here.

721
01:04:31.043 --> 01:04:33.462
She beats her mother at every turn.

722
01:04:38.425 --> 01:04:40.469
Thank you. Take care.

723
01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:49.895
Stop there.

724
01:04:51.229 --> 01:04:52.898
Play it again, but slow.

725
01:04:56.151 --> 01:04:56.985
There!

726
01:04:57.569 --> 01:04:59.613
- Someone hit her over the head, right?
- Where?


727
01:05:04.743 --> 01:05:05.619
There it is!

728
01:05:07.371 --> 01:05:08.246
Oh, God.

729
01:05:08.330 --> 01:05:10.082
They wanted to make sure she was dead.

730
01:05:15.462 --> 01:05:16.296
Hello?

731
01:05:17.881 --> 01:05:18.757
Where is she?

732
01:05:37.651 --> 01:05:38.985
- Xia...
- You...


733
01:05:40.237 --> 01:05:41.154
...come in.

734
01:06:00.048 --> 01:06:00.966
Thank you.

735
01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:10.976
Xia.

736
01:06:23.864 --> 01:06:24.823
I'm ashamed...

737
01:06:26.116 --> 01:06:27.534
...to be in front of you.

738
01:06:32.706 --> 01:06:35.625
I, I told them everything.

739
01:06:40.964 --> 01:06:45.886
But, but I have to tell you
something very important.


740
01:06:53.435 --> 01:06:56.229
The Tiananmen self-immolation is fake.

741
01:06:56.313 --> 01:06:57.814
What? How do you know?

742
01:06:59.524 --> 01:07:02.068
Remember Liu Fang,
the so-called organizer?


743
01:07:03.153 --> 01:07:04.529
I saw him in the detention center.

744
01:07:05.947 --> 01:07:07.282
What's going on?

745
01:07:09.701 --> 01:07:14.164
We were forced to watch
the video over and over.


746
01:07:14.915 --> 01:07:16.041
I swear I could recite it.

747
01:07:17.125 --> 01:07:21.379
I was working, one day...

748
01:07:22.255 --> 01:07:24.883
Don't worry, Liu.

749
01:07:24.966 --> 01:07:27.594
You'll be bailed out soon enough.

750
01:07:30.472 --> 01:07:32.724
Whatever the Party wants.

751
01:07:34.643 --> 01:07:37.896
You've done your country a great service.

752
01:07:38.438 --> 01:07:41.775
Where did you find them, anyway?

753
01:07:42.234 --> 01:07:45.487
You know I can't talk about that.

754
01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:47.364
Of course.

755
01:07:47.447 --> 01:07:48.907
Let's have a smoke.

756
01:07:53.328 --> 01:07:57.415
Liu, what a bold plan. Incredible.

757
01:07:57.499 --> 01:08:00.126
Isn't this proof?

758
01:08:01.378 --> 01:08:02.838
It's not enough.

759
01:08:04.047 --> 01:08:05.340
But it's a start.

760
01:08:11.263 --> 01:08:12.389
Xia,

761
01:08:14.641 --> 01:08:18.228
Would you be willing
to talk to a reporter?


762
01:08:21.481 --> 01:08:22.482
Yes.

763
01:08:25.402 --> 01:08:26.820
But who dares to expose this?

764
01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:29.823
I might know someone.

765
01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:34.411
- How was the trip?
- It was wonderful.


766
01:08:42.544 --> 01:08:43.879
You were...

767
01:08:45.714 --> 01:08:48.300
You were right about the food.

768
01:08:48.967 --> 01:08:50.343
Was it worth the journey?

769
01:08:52.762 --> 01:08:54.306
Yeah, it was...

770
01:08:55.682 --> 01:08:56.600
...well worth it.

771
01:11:58.531 --> 01:11:59.699
What are you doing?

772
01:12:02.952 --> 01:12:03.828
Uh...

773
01:12:04.329 --> 01:12:05.288
Homework.

774
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:08.625
Tsinghua University? Impressive.

775
01:12:08.708 --> 01:12:09.918
What are you studying?

776
01:12:10.001 --> 01:12:11.211
City planning.

777
01:12:12.003 --> 01:12:12.921
Continue with your studies then.

778
01:12:14.547 --> 01:12:15.507
All done for today, actually!

779
01:12:18.802 --> 01:12:19.886
Watch it!

780
01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.931
Falun Gong! This man is Falun Gong!

781
01:12:40.573 --> 01:12:42.617
Wang! Jun was arrested!

782
01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:44.577
- What?
- Pack up!


783
01:12:57.132 --> 01:12:59.300
- Get the diapers!
- Okay.


784
01:13:06.766 --> 01:13:07.642
Hurry!

785
01:13:29.414 --> 01:13:32.458
NO FALUN GONG

786
01:14:10.705 --> 01:14:11.789
Sit down and rest for a bit.

787
01:14:23.843 --> 01:14:26.095
I know. You're hungry.

788
01:14:26.179 --> 01:14:27.472
It's almost ready.

789
01:14:29.682 --> 01:14:31.351
It's okay. Don't cry.

790
01:14:31.434 --> 01:14:33.186
The bottle is almost ready.

791
01:14:36.856 --> 01:14:39.651
It's okay. Don't cry. 
The bottle's here.

792
01:14:51.329 --> 01:14:52.622
Can you find the diapers?

793
01:14:57.877 --> 01:14:59.212
Oh, no. I forgot them.

794
01:14:59.295 --> 01:15:01.923
I've specifically told you
to bring the diapers!


795
01:15:02.006 --> 01:15:03.925
I panicked. I forgot.

796
01:15:04.008 --> 01:15:06.511
How come you didn't forget
that garbage for your detector?


797
01:15:07.345 --> 01:15:09.472
We need this for tomorrow,
it's integral to the plan.


798
01:15:09.555 --> 01:15:11.307
You still want to go tomorrow?

799
01:15:12.225 --> 01:15:14.936
Finally there's a foreign reporter
interested in our story.


800
01:15:15.436 --> 01:15:17.063
This could change everything!

801
01:15:17.146 --> 01:15:18.231
How can we give up?

802
01:15:18.314 --> 01:15:19.899
What if you're arrested too?

803
01:15:20.942 --> 01:15:22.110
What about our baby?

804
01:15:23.194 --> 01:15:24.279
What about me?

805
01:15:31.869 --> 01:15:32.996
Li

806
01:15:33.579 --> 01:15:34.497
Tell me.

807
01:15:53.266 --> 01:15:54.142
Wang.

808
01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.687
You need to make a choice. Right now.

809
01:16:00.148 --> 01:16:01.566
Do you want me and the baby...

810
01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.737
...or do you want to go tomorrow?

811
01:16:08.239 --> 01:16:11.784
Li, please don't do this.

812
01:16:26.841 --> 01:16:28.593
It's late. Where are you going?

813
01:16:29.302 --> 01:16:30.219
Li.

814
01:16:30.678 --> 01:16:32.638
Where are you going?

815
01:16:34.015 --> 01:16:34.932
Li.

816
01:16:36.225 --> 01:16:38.853
Li, let's go back and talk.

817
01:16:39.312 --> 01:16:40.938
Where are you going with the baby?

818
01:16:41.439 --> 01:16:42.315
Li!

819
01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.361
- Li.
- Stop the car! Stop the car!


820
01:16:47.362 --> 01:16:49.614
Will you just listen to me?

821
01:16:50.281 --> 01:16:51.908
Li. Li.

822
01:16:52.533 --> 01:16:53.368
Li!

823
01:17:11.386 --> 01:17:13.262
How busy you are.

824
01:17:14.138 --> 01:17:16.933
Tell me, where's Wang?

825
01:17:18.309 --> 01:17:19.894
What are you up to?

826
01:17:34.492 --> 01:17:35.827
Tell me.

827
01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.872
What exactly is your plan?

828
01:18:10.653 --> 01:18:12.488
Last chance.

829
01:18:50.943 --> 01:18:52.403
I shouldn't have let him go.

830
01:18:53.571 --> 01:18:54.655
It's not your fault.

831
01:18:55.907 --> 01:18:57.492
If I went that day,

832
01:18:57.575 --> 01:18:59.035
Jun wouldn't have been arrested.

833
01:19:00.828 --> 01:19:04.248
Those police killed him, not you.

834
01:19:04.749 --> 01:19:07.502
But he died.
Nothing we do will bring him back.


835
01:19:18.971 --> 01:19:22.767
They killed Jun...

836
01:19:24.644 --> 01:19:28.648
...because he didn't tell them the plan.

837
01:19:30.274 --> 01:19:31.275
Wang.

838
01:19:33.611 --> 01:19:34.946
Wang.

839
01:19:36.781 --> 01:19:38.157
Wang!

840
01:19:42.703 --> 01:19:44.205
He wanted us to proceed.

841
01:19:45.289 --> 01:19:47.542
Do you want him to die for nothing?

842
01:19:51.629 --> 01:19:52.588
No.

843
01:19:54.298 --> 01:19:56.300
I can't allow them to take you back.

844
01:19:59.095 --> 01:20:00.680
You've suffered enough.

845
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:17.321
Let me tell you something.

846
01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:20.283
They tortured me...

847
01:20:22.326 --> 01:20:24.078
...in all kinds of ways in prison.

848
01:20:30.418 --> 01:20:32.628
Countless times,
I thought about hitting my head


849
01:20:32.712 --> 01:20:34.714
against the wall and ending it all.

850
01:20:40.761 --> 01:20:42.763
But I told myself to hold on.

851
01:20:42.847 --> 01:20:44.307
I must get out of here alive.

852
01:20:46.267 --> 01:20:49.437
I must expose their crimes to the world.

853
01:20:52.148 --> 01:20:53.482
Now I'm out.

854
01:20:54.442 --> 01:20:56.193
But many people are still locked inside.

855
01:20:59.864 --> 01:21:02.950
I will go tomorrow,

856
01:21:04.994 --> 01:21:06.203
even if it's by myself.

857
01:21:33.731 --> 01:21:37.360
Passengers for train E-13

858
01:21:37.443 --> 01:21:42.448
to Shanghai,
please go aboard at platform...


859
01:21:44.408 --> 01:21:49.872
Hi, I was hoping to get a plumber
sent to my apartment as soon as possible.


860
01:21:53.417 --> 01:21:54.251
Great.

861
01:21:55.127 --> 01:21:57.254
Okay. Yes.

862
01:21:58.047 --> 01:21:59.215
I can meet you there.

863
01:22:01.634 --> 01:22:03.678
Okay. Thanks.

864
01:22:16.357 --> 01:22:18.150
I have to go meet a plumber.

865
01:22:18.567 --> 01:22:19.527
See you tomorrow!

866
01:22:45.803 --> 01:22:48.013
- Hey, you the plumbers?
- Yes.


867
01:22:48.097 --> 01:22:49.890
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

868
01:22:49.974 --> 01:22:51.892
Sorry in advance. 
It's a really big job.

869
01:22:51.976 --> 01:22:53.394
It's right up here.

870
01:23:07.324 --> 01:23:10.995
I was having trouble flushing it.

871
01:23:11.704 --> 01:23:14.957
A few days ago.
And now it's completely broken.


872
01:23:16.876 --> 01:23:18.961
- Looks like a big job.
- Yeah.


873
01:23:19.962 --> 01:23:21.297
How long do you think it will take?

874
01:23:21.964 --> 01:23:23.382
A few hours, probably.

875
01:23:24.675 --> 01:23:27.178
- All right, well, you better get started.
- Okay.


876
01:24:01.337 --> 01:24:03.672
- Okay. Hi.
- Hi.


877
01:24:03.756 --> 01:24:06.091
I want you to tell me everything

878
01:24:06.175 --> 01:24:08.677
about the confession
you overheard in prison.


879
01:24:08.761 --> 01:24:11.764
Okay? It might be hard.
But the details are important.


880
01:24:19.104 --> 01:24:20.856
He's really just getting his toilet fixed.

881
01:24:21.232 --> 01:24:22.775
This tip is a bust.

882
01:24:28.447 --> 01:24:30.741
They tortured me so many times.

883
01:24:33.786 --> 01:24:35.120
One day...

884
01:24:36.705 --> 01:24:39.124
...they took off all of my clothes,

885
01:24:40.376 --> 01:24:42.461
and threw me into a men's cell

886
01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:45.214
until morning.

887
01:24:58.310 --> 01:25:00.521
Is there anything else you want to add?

888
01:25:02.523 --> 01:25:06.527
I would like to use my real name
to add credibility.


889
01:25:07.111 --> 01:25:09.572
Okay. All right. I...

890
01:25:10.906 --> 01:25:13.617
I have arranged
for you to leave China tomorrow.


891
01:25:15.119 --> 01:25:18.414
No, no, I want to stay.

892
01:25:20.207 --> 01:25:21.166
For change.

893
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:24.587
Are you sure? That's a big risk.

894
01:25:33.178 --> 01:25:34.054
Wait a second.

895
01:25:35.556 --> 01:25:36.849
How come there's a baby crying?

896
01:25:43.105 --> 01:25:45.065
We gotta go! We gotta go!

897
01:25:45.149 --> 01:25:46.275
We gotta go now!

898
01:25:46.358 --> 01:25:48.569
- Daniel, the tape recorder.
- Why?


899
01:25:48.652 --> 01:25:50.446
- Do you have a cable?
- Yes.


900
01:25:50.988 --> 01:25:52.448
It'll make them think
we're still in the apartment.


901
01:25:52.531 --> 01:25:54.408
- Okay.
- Shut down the elevators!


902
01:25:56.702 --> 01:25:57.620
Here.

903
01:26:05.461 --> 01:26:07.004
Come on, come on, come on.

904
01:26:12.843 --> 01:26:13.802
Okay, let's go.

905
01:26:18.599 --> 01:26:19.433
Hurry up!

906
01:26:19.516 --> 01:26:21.060
They are still in the apartment!

907
01:26:58.097 --> 01:26:59.348
See...

908
01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:02.184
- This is where we keep the hose...
- Yeah.


909
01:27:02.267 --> 01:27:04.228
- And you get...
- Yeah.


910
01:27:10.067 --> 01:27:10.985
Let me check.

911
01:27:16.281 --> 01:27:17.700
Okay, it's clear. Let's go.

912
01:27:32.214 --> 01:27:33.507
No sign of the target.

913
01:27:34.216 --> 01:27:35.134
No, no way.

914
01:27:35.217 --> 01:27:36.969
Okay, there's a,
there's a back door, come on.


915
01:27:43.058 --> 01:27:44.685
No, we're stuck.

916
01:27:47.604 --> 01:27:48.564
Wait right here.

917
01:27:50.190 --> 01:27:52.526
Until you hear them pass.
Then go for the back door.


918
01:27:52.609 --> 01:27:53.694
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

919
01:27:53.777 --> 01:27:56.113
Get out of China! 
As soon as possible.

920
01:27:57.448 --> 01:27:58.449
Get down.

921
01:28:02.995 --> 01:28:03.996
Stop!

922
01:28:41.909 --> 01:28:44.787
Where is Daniel Davis?

923
01:28:57.382 --> 01:29:00.761
WANTED 
- NATIONAL ALERT FOR DANIEL DAVIS

924
01:29:10.646 --> 01:29:11.814
Have you seen this person?

925
01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.154
Where is he?

926
01:29:19.947 --> 01:29:22.574
Sir, I really don't know.

927
01:29:23.450 --> 01:29:25.077
I have already given
all of the information.


928
01:29:25.577 --> 01:29:27.371
You were very close.

929
01:29:28.122 --> 01:29:29.623
The two of you.

930
01:29:29.706 --> 01:29:32.626
It's hard to believe that he would leave
without telling you where he was going.


931
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:34.962
He was my boss, nothing more.

932
01:29:35.796 --> 01:29:38.924
I swear to you.
He left the office to run an errand


933
01:29:39.007 --> 01:29:40.759
and that was the
last time I saw him.

934
01:29:44.847 --> 01:29:46.807
I, I really don't know where he is.

935
01:29:48.725 --> 01:29:51.436
It would be
in your best interest to find out.


936
01:29:52.479 --> 01:29:53.480
Don't you think?

937
01:30:02.906 --> 01:30:05.242
If you find Daniel,
what will happen to him?


938
01:30:08.078 --> 01:30:10.080
What you should be asking me is,

939
01:30:10.622 --> 01:30:12.207
what will happen to you...

940
01:30:14.459 --> 01:30:15.919
...if he gets away?

941
01:30:26.638 --> 01:30:27.639
What are you doing?

942
01:30:58.837 --> 01:31:02.382
You are not a weak man, Wang.

943
01:31:04.384 --> 01:31:06.386
You have done everything you could.

944
01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:11.767
One needs to know
when to retreat to fight another day.


945
01:31:13.727 --> 01:31:18.815
Do you really think an article
by a foreigner can save Falun Gong?


946
01:31:24.947 --> 01:31:27.991
Tell me where Daniel is.

947
01:31:29.701 --> 01:31:31.370
You stay alive.

948
01:31:31.995 --> 01:31:35.916
And someday you'll get
to hear your child call you "Dad."


949
01:31:42.130 --> 01:31:45.801
At least my child will grow up

950
01:31:47.344 --> 01:31:50.847
knowing that her father

951
01:31:51.765 --> 01:31:53.517
fought for the truth.

952
01:31:54.935 --> 01:31:55.811
The truth?

953
01:32:02.442 --> 01:32:04.027
From what, your little flyers?

954
01:32:05.654 --> 01:32:08.365
There are more than two thousand
newspapers nationwide,


955
01:32:08.448 --> 01:32:10.284
circulating to millions every day.

956
01:32:12.744 --> 01:32:14.371
How many flyers do
you really think you can print?


957
01:32:18.166 --> 01:32:19.209
One day,

958
01:32:20.210 --> 01:32:22.212
the lies will be
seen for what they are.

959
01:32:24.464 --> 01:32:26.049
In the face of the truth,

960
01:32:27.384 --> 01:32:30.220
no matter what misinformation you spread,
people will see through it.


961
01:32:32.097 --> 01:32:37.728
Even your military
and police may turn against you.


962
01:32:39.855 --> 01:32:42.357
Did it ever occur to you?

963
01:32:45.777 --> 01:32:46.820
Interesting.

964
01:32:52.284 --> 01:32:53.702
I have a question, though.

965
01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:58.540
Do you think you'll
get to see that day?

966
01:32:59.333 --> 01:33:00.876
Ask yourself.

967
01:33:02.586 --> 01:33:08.258
You are an evil
person in an evil machine.

968
01:33:09.593 --> 01:33:13.930
You'll either be destroyed
by power struggles in the Party,


969
01:33:15.057 --> 01:33:17.476
or be brought to justice
when the Party eventually falls.


970
01:33:19.436 --> 01:33:25.692
What use will the money
and the power be, then?


971
01:33:29.988 --> 01:33:33.492
Everyone is a victim

972
01:33:34.159 --> 01:33:36.370
in a society with no truth or justice.

973
01:33:37.579 --> 01:33:39.081
And you are no exception.

974
01:34:09.069 --> 01:34:10.237
Enjoy.

975
01:34:23.083 --> 01:34:24.000
The car is here.

976
01:34:34.886 --> 01:34:36.179
It's time to go.

977
01:34:41.393 --> 01:34:43.562
Thank you. Thank you.

978
01:36:08.772 --> 01:36:09.856
Thank you.

979
01:37:13.169 --> 01:37:14.879
Despite the spread of information

980
01:37:14.963 --> 01:37:18.216
to the Western world, persecution in China

981
01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:20.510
continues to this day.

982
01:37:22.596 --> 01:37:23.513
In fact...

983
01:37:24.723 --> 01:37:29.936
...one of the key sources
for this article is in prison,


984
01:37:30.854 --> 01:37:32.814
presumably being tortured,

985
01:37:34.107 --> 01:37:35.275
as I speak to you now.

986
01:37:36.651 --> 01:37:37.527
His name...

987
01:37:38.778 --> 01:37:40.655
...is Wang Boyu.

988
01:37:41.364 --> 01:37:44.492
And more than anyone
I've met on this journey,


989
01:37:44.576 --> 01:37:47.746
he embodied the principles of Falun Gong.

990
01:37:48.330 --> 01:37:49.164
Truth.

991
01:37:50.123 --> 01:37:51.249
Compassion.

992
01:37:52.751 --> 01:37:53.835
Tolerance.

993
01:37:54.961 --> 01:37:56.880
He risked everything for them.

994
01:37:59.799 --> 01:38:02.761
I only hope we will do the same.

995
01:38:03.678 --> 01:38:07.349
Now, there have been some concerns

996
01:38:07.432 --> 01:38:10.852
raised by Western countries.

997
01:38:11.561 --> 01:38:16.983
But little has been done
to protect these innocent people.


998
01:38:18.401 --> 01:38:20.028
We must be more like Wang.

999
01:38:21.821 --> 01:38:24.824
We must do everything we can

1000
01:38:26.242 --> 01:38:28.244
to bring the truth into the light.

1001
01:38:29.537 --> 01:38:30.413
Thank you!

1002
01:38:32.874 --> 01:38:33.708
Thank you.

1003
01:38:36.461 --> 01:38:37.337
Thank you.

1004
01:38:49.349 --> 01:38:51.184
Attention please,

1005
01:38:51.267 --> 01:38:56.439
train number E-13 from Beijing

1006
01:38:56.523 --> 01:39:00.193
has arrived at Shanghai station.

1007
01:39:19.337 --> 01:39:20.213
Well, you won.

1008
01:39:28.596 --> 01:39:34.561
We'll get a few diplomatic letters
of concern, perhaps.


1009
01:39:39.107 --> 01:39:40.066
Then, what?

1010
01:39:42.652 --> 01:39:44.779
Soon you'll be executed in secret.

1011
01:39:47.157 --> 01:39:48.616
And the world will forget.

1012
01:39:49.909 --> 01:39:52.203
They'll forget this article.

1013
01:39:52.787 --> 01:39:53.913
And you.

1014
01:39:56.082 --> 01:39:57.584
And soon they'll forget
Falun Gong altogether.


1015
01:40:14.893 --> 01:40:15.894
I see.

1016
01:40:26.571 --> 01:40:27.614
Enjoy

1017
01:40:29.282 --> 01:40:30.575
your last meal.

1018
01:41:08.196 --> 01:41:10.573
Secretary Yang! 
Secretary Yang!

1019
01:43:20.912 --> 01:43:22.455
Perhaps due to international pressure,

1020
01:43:22.538 --> 01:43:24.874
I was eventually sentenced
to 8 years in prison.


1021
01:43:26.542 --> 01:43:29.504
Those 8 years are supposed
to be the prime of one's life.


1022
01:43:30.630 --> 01:43:35.051
But for me it was a nightmare
I'd rather not remember.


1023
01:43:37.053 --> 01:43:41.849
After I was released, my family
and I managed to find refuge in the U.S.


1024
01:43:44.018 --> 01:43:47.313
However, many practitioners
I know are still persecuted in China.


1025
01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:53.987
Many religious groups, ethnic minorities

1026
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:57.865
and political dissidents
are still suppressed.


1027
01:43:59.701 --> 01:44:04.247
The Chinese regime still lies
to its own people and to the whole world.


1028
01:44:06.457 --> 01:44:09.752
I believe that no matter
how powerful lies are,


1029
01:44:09.836 --> 01:44:12.005
if we all seek the truth,

1030
01:44:12.463 --> 01:44:15.008
insist on the truth and tell the truth,

1031
01:44:16.175 --> 01:44:18.511
truth will ultimately prevail.
