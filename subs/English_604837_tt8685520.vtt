1
00:02:37.194 --> 00:02:39.558
Norman Francis Vandivier.

2
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.775
Right where I left you.

3
00:02:47.778 --> 00:02:50.562
Didn't you promise never
to walk through that door again?


4
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.604
Yeah, well,
you make a lot of promises


5
00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:54.974
when you're puking up
a gallon of Mai Tais.


6
00:02:59.361 --> 00:03:01.190
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too, Jim.


7
00:03:01.194 --> 00:03:03.308
Back from your exile in Panama?

8
00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.228
As a matter of fact, I am.

9
00:03:05.236 --> 00:03:08.475
We asked the Navy real nice
if we could come back to Pearl.


10
00:03:08.486 --> 00:03:10.099
Surprisingly, they said yes.

11
00:03:10.111 --> 00:03:12.100
Yeah. You always
were persuasive.


12
00:03:12.111 --> 00:03:14.020
It wasn't just me.

13
00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:16.107
When I told the brass
that Norman Vandivier


14
00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:17.850
wasn't having
any fun without me,


15
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:19.315
they signed the orders
right away.


16
00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.478
- Well.
- Yeah.


17
00:03:20.486 --> 00:03:22.065
Wish I had known
about my amazing


18
00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.478
influential name before.

19
00:03:24.736 --> 00:03:26.065
Welcome home.

20
00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.433
It's damn good to be back.

21
00:03:28.444 --> 00:03:31.308
I swear, Panama must be
what hell is like.


22
00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.898
- Hmm.
- It's hot.


23
00:03:32.902 --> 00:03:34.482
There are mosquitoes
the size of birds.


24
00:03:34.486 --> 00:03:36.770
And crocodiles.
Goddamn crocodiles.


25
00:03:36.778 --> 00:03:39.767
Hmm. So where's your band
of misfits?


26
00:03:39.778 --> 00:03:41.482
Uh, well, they hit
the Hotel Street


27
00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:42.940
as soon as we hit the dock.

28
00:03:42.944 --> 00:03:45.024
I came here
on account of the fact


29
00:03:45.027 --> 00:03:46.357
that you owe me so many drinks.

30
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:48.315
Well, you're way behind.

31
00:03:50.528 --> 00:03:52.357
What'll it be, Lieutenant?

32
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:53.849
Let's get a whiskey and soda.

33
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.019
That I can do.

34
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.894
Who's the letter to?

35
00:03:57.902 --> 00:03:59.812
Some beautiful hula girl?

36
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.149
Aw, shucks, Lieutenant,
I'm just writing my ma.


37
00:04:02.152 --> 00:04:03.732
Hmm. Yeah.

38
00:04:03.736 --> 00:04:06.145
The only girl in my life
is the Big "E".


39
00:04:06.152 --> 00:04:08.856
Right. Big "".E.

40
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.144
She is one hell of a lady, huh?

41
00:04:11.152 --> 00:04:13.436
She's got men inside of her

42
00:04:13.444 --> 00:04:15.182
Ah. Jealousy,
such an ugly thing.


43
00:04:15.194 --> 00:04:16.808
No. No. It's not jealousy.

44
00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:18.479
It's just that I happen
to have a new lady


45
00:04:18.486 --> 00:04:19.770
in my life as well,
thanks for asking.


46
00:04:19.778 --> 00:04:20.811
- Ooh.
- Yeah.


47
00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:23.933
- Okay.
- Brand-new PBY Catalina.


48
00:04:23.944 --> 00:04:25.933
Well, congratulations.

49
00:04:25.944 --> 00:04:27.649
- Thank you.
- You know, she's a real beaut.


50
00:04:27.653 --> 00:04:29.811
Faster and sexier
than the old model.


51
00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:31.058
Hmm.

52
00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.683
Who's jealous now?

53
00:04:32.695 --> 00:04:35.479
Well, the Dauntless
is no speed demon, but...


54
00:04:35.486 --> 00:04:37.691
I'm pretty sure
you wouldn't wanna race me.


55
00:04:37.695 --> 00:04:40.308
I'm sure she's fast in the dive,

56
00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:42.057
but how fast is she
in the water?


57
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:46.270
Well, let's hope
I never find that out.


58
00:04:46.278 --> 00:04:48.642
- Agreed.
- Attacked the Wake Island.


59
00:04:48.653 --> 00:04:50.232
- Cheers, bro.
- And this morning,


60
00:04:50.236 --> 00:04:53.691
the Japanese attacked
Midway Island.


61
00:04:53.695 --> 00:04:55.933
The United States of America

62
00:04:55.944 --> 00:04:58.183
is suddenly
and deliberately attacked


63
00:04:58.194 --> 00:05:00.683
by naval and air forces

64
00:05:00.695 --> 00:05:03.729
of the Empire of Japan.

65
00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:08.808
I have, with the
Congress, declare


66
00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:12.229
that since the unprovoked

67
00:05:12.236 --> 00:05:16.895
and dastardly attacks by Japan

68
00:05:16.902 --> 00:05:23.142
on Sunday, December 7th, 1941,

69
00:05:23.152 --> 00:05:29.016
a state of war has existed

70
00:05:29.027 --> 00:05:31.186
between the United States

71
00:05:31.194 --> 00:05:33.399
and the Japanese Empire.

72
00:05:52.486 --> 00:05:53.849
You tell the ladies
you're a helldiver,


73
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.440
and they just swoon.

74
00:05:55.444 --> 00:05:57.057
I haven't flown a biplane
since training.


75
00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:59.023
- That's not the point.
- They hear helldivers,


76
00:05:59.027 --> 00:06:01.357
and they think of the movie.
They think of Clark Gable.


77
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.849
- Then you're in.
- I don't even know


78
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.849
what this movie is about
besides helldivers.


79
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.814
- And I can't dance.
- There wasn't no dancing in it.


80
00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:08.149
You're thinking of Gene Kelly.

81
00:06:08.152 --> 00:06:09.436
No, I'm not.

82
00:06:09.444 --> 00:06:10.852
He danced in that movie.

83
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.645
That big number
with Norma Shearer.


84
00:06:12.653 --> 00:06:14.732
"Idiot's Delight"?
You saw a stinker like that,


85
00:06:14.735 --> 00:06:16.599
but you didn't see a classic
like "Hell Divers"?


86
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:18.315
- I guess not.
- That's a damn disgrace


87
00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:20.524
of a naval aviator
who hasn't seen "Hell Divers."


88
00:06:20.528 --> 00:06:24.437
- Prepare to launch plane.
- Prepare to launch plane.


89
00:06:30.735 --> 00:06:33.019
We've completed our turn
into the wind, sir.


90
00:06:33.027 --> 00:06:34.731
We're ready to launch
on your word.


91
00:06:34.735 --> 00:06:36.270
Get the planes in the air.

92
00:06:36.278 --> 00:06:37.357
Aye, sir.

93
00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:41.058
- Yes, sir?
- Launch. Launch. Launch.


94
00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:42.308
Aye, aye, sir.

95
00:06:46.986 --> 00:06:47.985
Clear the flight deck.

96
00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:53.978
When we get back to Pearl,
I'll have to catch


97
00:06:53.986 --> 00:06:56.350
- that Hell Diver flick.
- You'll love it.


98
00:06:56.361 --> 00:06:58.190
You'll be using it to pick up
the clean girls in port


99
00:06:58.194 --> 00:06:59.193
before you know it.

100
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:01.940
Can't wait.

101
00:07:01.944 --> 00:07:04.058
- Good hunting, Ramsay.
- Good hunting.


102
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.354
Pilots, start your engine.

103
00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:26.891
- Morning, Lee.
- Morning, sir.


104
00:07:29.486 --> 00:07:31.895
Don't tell me you've been
sitting here since reveille.


105
00:07:31.902 --> 00:07:33.640
No, sir.

106
00:07:33.652 --> 00:07:36.482
Well... not entirely, sir.

107
00:07:40.777 --> 00:07:42.516
So you did
the preflight checks then?


108
00:07:45.902 --> 00:07:47.107
Twice, sir.

109
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.849
Why twice?

110
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.474
There's been
some mechanical problems


111
00:07:52.486 --> 00:07:54.020
with the SBDs this morning.

112
00:07:54.027 --> 00:07:55.640
I didn't want to be one of them.

113
00:07:55.652 --> 00:07:57.482
That's good thinking.

114
00:07:57.486 --> 00:07:58.849
I'd hate for us
to get all dressed up


115
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.894
and have nowhere to go.

116
00:08:09.944 --> 00:08:11.524
Looks like we're up, sir.

117
00:08:11.528 --> 00:08:12.857
You ready?

118
00:08:14.236 --> 00:08:17.816
- I'm excited, sir.
- Just a little nervous.


119
00:08:17.819 --> 00:08:19.479
Yeah. That's totally healthy.

120
00:08:19.486 --> 00:08:21.815
I'll never forget
how nervous I was


121
00:08:21.819 --> 00:08:23.558
the first time
I did a night takeoff.


122
00:08:26.444 --> 00:08:28.228
You serious?

123
00:08:28.236 --> 00:08:30.225
You took off a carrier at night?

124
00:08:30.236 --> 00:08:31.974
Not exactly.

125
00:08:31.986 --> 00:08:33.975
A night takeoff is when
you throttle up off the deck


126
00:08:33.986 --> 00:08:35.270
with your eyes closed.

127
00:08:37.986 --> 00:08:38.985
Really?

128
00:08:40.111 --> 00:08:41.350
Sir?

129
00:08:41.361 --> 00:08:42.599
Hold on.

130
00:08:44.278 --> 00:08:46.232
This is always the worst part.

131
00:08:46.236 --> 00:08:48.849
Launch plane. Launch plane.

132
00:09:08.694 --> 00:09:11.395
Just remember,
if anything happens,


133
00:09:11.403 --> 00:09:14.142
don't panic, all right?

134
00:09:14.152 --> 00:09:15.890
If we end up in the drink
on the takeoff,


135
00:09:15.902 --> 00:09:17.311
there's a beautiful
destroyer there


136
00:09:17.319 --> 00:09:19.308
waiting to pick us up.

137
00:09:19.319 --> 00:09:20.478
Aye, sir.

138
00:09:28.527 --> 00:09:30.062
Here we go.

139
00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:40.399
Woo-hoo!

140
00:09:43.444 --> 00:09:44.852
What a thrill, huh?

141
00:09:49.069 --> 00:09:50.932
You'll always remember
your first time.


142
00:09:53.111 --> 00:09:54.599
Absolutely, sir.

143
00:09:57.444 --> 00:10:00.183
Be hell a lot better
once we see some Jap carriers.


144
00:10:03.403 --> 00:10:06.267
Falling into formation
with VB-6.


145
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:53.103
Does it...

146
00:10:54.403 --> 00:10:56.812
Does it always take this long?

147
00:10:56.819 --> 00:10:58.603
No.

148
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.270
That pompous ass Browning

149
00:11:00.278 --> 00:11:02.141
probably hasn't crawled
out of bed yet to give us


150
00:11:02.152 --> 00:11:03.151
the go-ahead.

151
00:11:04.236 --> 00:11:05.350
Yeah.

152
00:11:07.569 --> 00:11:08.603
I don't...

153
00:11:10.485 --> 00:11:13.065
It looks like more mechanicals
down there to me.


154
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:14.228
Probably.

155
00:11:14.236 --> 00:11:16.316
But I like my version better.

156
00:11:17.735 --> 00:11:19.099
Either way,
it's better we're up here


157
00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:21.100
than down there.

158
00:11:21.111 --> 00:11:23.020
It's gonna be a shitty day
to push planes.


159
00:11:23.027 --> 00:11:24.640
You're damn right, sir.

160
00:11:25.944 --> 00:11:29.232
I'm... I'm ready for some action.

161
00:11:29.236 --> 00:11:31.190
As long as the Wildcats
are doing their job,


162
00:11:31.194 --> 00:11:33.523
we probably won't see
a whole lot.


163
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.099
- Sir?
- I see it.


164
00:11:49.111 --> 00:11:50.099
And so does McClusky.

165
00:11:50.111 --> 00:11:52.440
Pulling into formation.

166
00:12:45.152 --> 00:12:47.141
Where...

167
00:12:47.152 --> 00:12:49.515
Where are the Wildcats
and Devastators at?


168
00:12:52.278 --> 00:12:54.016
Huh.

169
00:12:54.027 --> 00:12:56.107
Must be a no-frills operation.

170
00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:00.141
Don't worry.

171
00:13:00.152 --> 00:13:01.936
Brass knows what they're doing.

172
00:13:01.944 --> 00:13:04.024
If all else fails,
that's what those shiny guns


173
00:13:04.027 --> 00:13:05.481
are there for, right?

174
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.348
Aye, sir.

175
00:13:11.652 --> 00:13:13.356
Please, dear Lord,

176
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.199
let the brass know
what the hell they're doing.


177
00:13:48.694 --> 00:13:51.398
Sir. Look.

178
00:13:56.152 --> 00:13:57.856
Reducing altitude.

179
00:14:23.152 --> 00:14:24.151
Ah.

180
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:28.894
Good news.

181
00:14:30.694 --> 00:14:32.273
We can come off the 02.

182
00:14:32.277 --> 00:14:33.812
Best is taking us in.

183
00:14:35.027 --> 00:14:36.481
Thank God.

184
00:14:42.986 --> 00:14:44.599
How long were we up there?

185
00:14:46.235 --> 00:14:47.770
About an hour and change.

186
00:14:47.777 --> 00:14:49.311
Oh.

187
00:14:49.318 --> 00:14:51.773
Yeah, an hour and change
of my face itching


188
00:14:51.777 --> 00:14:54.231
and my head swimming.

189
00:14:54.235 --> 00:14:55.895
Don't let one
of the heavy bomber boys


190
00:14:55.902 --> 00:14:57.765
hear you whining
about the 02 masks.


191
00:14:57.777 --> 00:14:59.515
They got to keep them on

192
00:14:59.527 --> 00:15:00.641
eight, twelve hours.

193
00:15:00.652 --> 00:15:02.265
Yeah.

194
00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:04.141
Better them than us, though.

195
00:15:04.152 --> 00:15:06.310
Maybe.

196
00:15:06.318 --> 00:15:08.103
Those big sons of bitches
certainly stay up


197
00:15:08.111 --> 00:15:09.690
a hell of a lot longer
than we do.


198
00:15:13.902 --> 00:15:15.310
I'll tell you,

199
00:15:15.318 --> 00:15:18.307
all that circling
and reduced altitude


200
00:15:18.318 --> 00:15:20.523
sure didn't do us any favors
in the fuel department.


201
00:15:22.694 --> 00:15:25.024
That's what I like
about you, sir.


202
00:15:25.027 --> 00:15:27.982
You always seem to find
the dark clouds inside the


203
00:15:27.986 --> 00:15:30.224
silver lining.

204
00:15:30.235 --> 00:15:31.599
Just keep your eyes
peeled for Japs


205
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:32.644
and enjoy the flight.

206
00:15:32.652 --> 00:15:34.436
Aye, aye, sir.

207
00:15:45.694 --> 00:15:48.478
Hey, Vandivier, sir?

208
00:15:48.485 --> 00:15:49.519
Yeah.

209
00:15:49.527 --> 00:15:52.849
I got, uh... a stupid question,

210
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.940
but it never came up
during gunnery training.


211
00:15:54.944 --> 00:15:56.807
It's about the plane.

212
00:15:56.819 --> 00:15:58.307
What's that?

213
00:15:58.318 --> 00:16:00.147
Where's the head?

214
00:16:01.652 --> 00:16:03.857
Does it look like
there's a head in this plane?


215
00:16:05.527 --> 00:16:07.607
No, sir.

216
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:12.565
It's just that I've been staring
at this water for hours,


217
00:16:12.569 --> 00:16:15.228
and I had a bit too much coffee
this morning, that's all.


218
00:16:15.235 --> 00:16:16.770
Well, you have two options.

219
00:16:16.777 --> 00:16:19.061
You can either hold it,

220
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:22.228
or if you look down
below your seat to the left,


221
00:16:22.235 --> 00:16:24.269
you'll see a tube.

222
00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:28.773
Found it!

223
00:16:28.777 --> 00:16:31.016
Be careful at this altitude.

224
00:16:31.027 --> 00:16:32.981
You don't want little Keaney
accidentally touching


225
00:16:32.986 --> 00:16:34.190
anything metal.

226
00:16:41.986 --> 00:16:44.895
- Know what?
- I think I'll just hold it.


227
00:16:44.902 --> 00:16:48.311
The mental image
just dried me up.


228
00:16:56.652 --> 00:16:57.982
What's going on?

229
00:16:57.986 --> 00:16:59.975
Best just turned his ship.

230
00:17:04.277 --> 00:17:07.357
- I'm seeing wake!
- I see it.


231
00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:14.853
- Best sees it too.
- He's taking us in.


232
00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:18.849
Now get your ears on and be
on the lookout for Zeros.


233
00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.644
VS-6 and VB-6,

234
00:17:20.652 --> 00:17:22.857
I have spotted
an enemy carrier group.


235
00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:24.769
Sir!

236
00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:28.140
McClusky is reporting
enemy carrier group sighted.


237
00:17:28.151 --> 00:17:30.231
This is it!

238
00:17:30.235 --> 00:17:31.269
What's our target?

239
00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.189
- Hold on, sir.
- I'm getting a lot of cross talk!


240
00:17:35.193 --> 00:17:36.978
Put it on.

241
00:17:36.986 --> 00:17:38.690
All divisions prepare
for attack.


242
00:17:38.694 --> 00:17:40.228
Carrier to the left.

243
00:17:40.235 --> 00:17:41.690
Best, you take the one
to the right.


244
00:17:41.694 --> 00:17:43.307
All divisions commence attack.

245
00:17:43.318 --> 00:17:44.853
Did you catch any of that?

246
00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.689
Sort of!

247
00:17:46.694 --> 00:17:49.023
What's our target,
the front or the back?


248
00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:50.515
I don't know!

249
00:17:56.735 --> 00:17:57.849
Shit.

250
00:18:03.694 --> 00:18:05.148
Wait, wait, wait!

251
00:18:05.151 --> 00:18:06.640
Best isn't diving!

252
00:18:06.652 --> 00:18:08.311
He's waggling his wings!

253
00:18:08.318 --> 00:18:09.602
Already committed!

254
00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:10.598
No. No, no, no!

255
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:11.609
Hold on!

256
00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.690
Scratch one flattop!

257
00:19:23.694 --> 00:19:25.899
You okay back there?

258
00:19:25.902 --> 00:19:29.186
I seem to have urinated, sir!

259
00:19:29.193 --> 00:19:31.307
Stop bragging and guns up!

260
00:19:31.318 --> 00:19:34.182
We got more than soggy drawers
to worry about!


261
00:19:34.193 --> 00:19:36.056
Zeros incoming!

262
00:19:50.735 --> 00:19:52.939
Contacts!

263
00:19:52.943 --> 00:19:55.808
Three! I see three!

264
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.815
Sir, they're getting closer!

265
00:20:11.819 --> 00:20:13.227
Well, discourage them!

266
00:20:13.235 --> 00:20:14.724
What?

267
00:20:14.735 --> 00:20:16.939
Shoot them
with the fucking guns!


268
00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.939
There's Zeros everywhere!

269
00:20:30.485 --> 00:20:32.690
Guess we found out
where their combat air patrols


270
00:20:32.694 --> 00:20:33.852
were hanging around.

271
00:20:38.485 --> 00:20:39.644
Two more!

272
00:20:39.652 --> 00:20:41.732
Three o'clock high!

273
00:20:41.735 --> 00:20:44.599
And they're really pissed off!

274
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.269
Well, we did just sink
their carrier.


275
00:20:46.277 --> 00:20:47.482
What?

276
00:20:47.485 --> 00:20:49.644
Whose side are you on anyway?

277
00:20:49.652 --> 00:20:50.935
Hold them off of us!

278
00:20:52.402 --> 00:20:54.015
I'm dropping to the deck.

279
00:20:54.026 --> 00:20:55.356
You're gonna what?

280
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.394
Go, go.

281
00:21:03.527 --> 00:21:05.561
I didn't sign up for this, sir!

282
00:21:05.569 --> 00:21:07.228
Oh, no! My God!

283
00:21:08.735 --> 00:21:10.189
Hold on, Lee!

284
00:21:10.193 --> 00:21:11.806
They're almost ripe for picking!

285
00:21:17.901 --> 00:21:20.231
We're hit! We're hit!

286
00:21:20.235 --> 00:21:21.314
Shit!

287
00:21:24.694 --> 00:21:26.852
You okay back there?

288
00:21:26.859 --> 00:21:28.939
Lee?

289
00:21:28.943 --> 00:21:31.227
Lee, you with me?

290
00:21:31.235 --> 00:21:32.440
I'm okay.

291
00:21:32.443 --> 00:21:35.307
I'm okay. I'm okay.

292
00:21:35.318 --> 00:21:36.648
You?

293
00:21:36.652 --> 00:21:39.855
- I'm rattled...
- but I'm not hurt.


294
00:21:39.859 --> 00:21:41.268
What's the damage?

295
00:21:43.235 --> 00:21:46.348
- I don't even...
- know where to begin.


296
00:21:47.485 --> 00:21:49.814
Oil pressure is dropping.

297
00:21:49.818 --> 00:21:51.648
I'm fighting the controls!

298
00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:01.307
How far are we from the "E"?

299
00:22:01.318 --> 00:22:02.772
I don't know!

300
00:22:02.776 --> 00:22:04.686
Far. Why?

301
00:22:04.694 --> 00:22:06.398
Fuel leak!

302
00:22:07.859 --> 00:22:09.439
Relay and transmit!

303
00:22:10.527 --> 00:22:11.641
Go!

304
00:22:11.652 --> 00:22:17.182
This is SBD... 6
-B-14.

305
00:22:17.193 --> 00:22:19.307
Open tank and dead stick.

306
00:22:19.318 --> 00:22:22.603
We're making a water landing

307
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.144
of enemy force.

308
00:22:25.151 --> 00:22:26.764
- Sent!
- Hold on.


309
00:22:28.235 --> 00:22:29.349
This is gonna be rough!

310
00:23:04.901 --> 00:23:06.890
What the hell?

311
00:23:06.901 --> 00:23:09.265
Which one of you jokers
glued my rations shut, huh?


312
00:23:10.318 --> 00:23:11.931
Oh, yeah. Very funny.

313
00:23:11.943 --> 00:23:14.773
Word of advice.
You all better sleep lightly.


314
00:23:14.776 --> 00:23:15.855
Yeah.

315
00:23:15.859 --> 00:23:17.098
Hey.

316
00:23:18.193 --> 00:23:19.772
Picking up some chatter.

317
00:23:19.776 --> 00:23:21.356
Did they get another flattop?

318
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.474
- Yeah, hold your damn horses.
- I'm listening.


319
00:23:26.569 --> 00:23:28.273
It's chatter from some SBDs.

320
00:23:29.943 --> 00:23:32.261
They can't find their carrier,
and they're all low on fuel.


321
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:36.314
Sounds like things
went a little pear shaped


322
00:23:36.318 --> 00:23:38.648
and now they're gonna
have to ditch in the sea.


323
00:23:38.651 --> 00:23:39.981
Which carrier
and how far from it?


324
00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:41.814
They didn't say.

325
00:23:41.818 --> 00:23:43.681
Japs could be listening,
I guess.


326
00:23:46.277 --> 00:23:48.391
Well, let's get in the air.

327
00:23:48.402 --> 00:23:50.265
- You got it.
- Nus, see if you can figure out


328
00:23:50.277 --> 00:23:51.811
where we think the Jap fleet was

329
00:23:51.818 --> 00:23:53.647
and where the carriers are.
Best guess.


330
00:23:53.651 --> 00:23:55.106
We'll see if we can find
these guys.


331
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:56.644
Aye, sir.

332
00:23:56.651 --> 00:23:58.311
All right, boys, listen up.

333
00:23:58.318 --> 00:24:00.147
Lunch time's over.

334
00:24:00.151 --> 00:24:02.310
Mansfield,
report to Midway Station


335
00:24:02.318 --> 00:24:04.022
that we're gonna continue
our scouting operations


336
00:24:04.026 --> 00:24:05.606
- for Jap forces.
- On it.


337
00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.564
Nus, I want you to plot
a course in such a way


338
00:24:07.569 --> 00:24:09.228
that we might be able
to find one of these guys.


339
00:24:09.235 --> 00:24:10.474
- You got it.
- Mansfield,


340
00:24:10.485 --> 00:24:12.064
I want you to keep
those ears on, all right?


341
00:24:12.068 --> 00:24:13.727
I want you to write down
anything that you pick up...


342
00:24:13.734 --> 00:24:16.519
- Names, positions, anything.
- On it, sir.


343
00:24:16.527 --> 00:24:17.981
Nus, I need a heading
and waypoint soonest.


344
00:24:17.985 --> 00:24:19.814
- Uh-hmm.
- Smokey, let's go.


345
00:24:22.068 --> 00:24:23.056
Did you miss me?

346
00:24:23.068 --> 00:24:24.603
Always.

347
00:24:24.609 --> 00:24:25.688
Open the tail flaps.

348
00:24:25.693 --> 00:24:26.852
On it.

349
00:24:26.859 --> 00:24:28.848
Everybody's accounted for.

350
00:24:28.859 --> 00:24:29.938
Contact.

351
00:24:32.068 --> 00:24:35.269
All right, everybody,
heading out.


352
00:25:38.776 --> 00:25:40.265
Norman!

353
00:25:50.693 --> 00:25:52.522
Sir!

354
00:25:52.526 --> 00:25:53.856
Get out of the plane!

355
00:25:53.859 --> 00:25:55.189
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

356
00:25:55.402 --> 00:25:57.981
- Get out!
- Fuck.


357
00:25:58.609 --> 00:25:59.608
Get out!

358
00:26:03.443 --> 00:26:05.102
Let's go! Let's go!

359
00:26:13.734 --> 00:26:16.144
- Come on!
- You ain't destroying.


360
00:26:19.277 --> 00:26:21.936
Shit! The raft! The raft!

361
00:26:21.943 --> 00:26:23.307
Shit!

362
00:26:29.651 --> 00:26:30.981
Fuck!

363
00:26:34.985 --> 00:26:36.190
Lee.

364
00:26:36.193 --> 00:26:37.681
Lee.

365
00:26:46.734 --> 00:26:49.890
- Did you think we...
- we got it, sir?


366
00:26:49.901 --> 00:26:51.639
You think we hit the flattop?

367
00:26:53.985 --> 00:26:55.394
Yeah.

368
00:26:55.402 --> 00:26:57.515
There's no way I missed.

369
00:26:57.526 --> 00:26:59.640
There's no way.

370
00:26:59.651 --> 00:27:02.981
Win-win, then. Yeah?

371
00:27:02.985 --> 00:27:04.144
Yeah.

372
00:27:04.151 --> 00:27:06.480
We stuck it to the Japs,

373
00:27:06.484 --> 00:27:07.848
and I don't have to clean up

374
00:27:07.859 --> 00:27:09.563
a piss-soaked
gunnery compartment.


375
00:27:20.734 --> 00:27:23.768
I'm sorry about the raft.

376
00:27:27.318 --> 00:27:28.397
It's okay.

377
00:27:30.818 --> 00:27:32.932
About a dozen planes
saw us go down.


378
00:27:34.818 --> 00:27:39.522
We'll just float here
and watch the show,


379
00:27:39.526 --> 00:27:41.890
and we'll get picked up
by breakfast.


380
00:27:43.818 --> 00:27:45.182
Breakfast, huh?

381
00:27:46.734 --> 00:27:50.223
What do you think
they'll be having?


382
00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:52.598
Shit on a shingle,
that's my favorite.


383
00:27:52.609 --> 00:27:54.064
What about you?

384
00:27:54.068 --> 00:27:55.602
Got to raise your standards,
Keaney.


385
00:27:57.651 --> 00:27:58.981
I'm thinking steak and lobster.

386
00:28:00.776 --> 00:28:02.981
Steak and lobster.

387
00:28:02.985 --> 00:28:04.723
Let me see that wound, 
- Yeah.

388
00:28:06.484 --> 00:28:08.269
I don't know. Oh.

389
00:28:09.943 --> 00:28:11.932
- All right.
- Let's get you patched up.


390
00:28:22.484 --> 00:28:25.814
All personnel,
incoming friendly aircraft.


391
00:28:36.776 --> 00:28:40.140
Incoming aircraft,
starboard, 301 on approach.


392
00:28:42.985 --> 00:28:45.144
Initial reports
are very promising, sir.


393
00:28:45.151 --> 00:28:46.310
We sunk three carriers.

394
00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:51.307
1400 hours, and enough time
to refuel, rearm,


395
00:28:51.318 --> 00:28:53.272
and send out a second sortie
to finish the job.


396
00:28:58.068 --> 00:28:59.397
We have men in the water.

397
00:28:59.401 --> 00:29:01.311
Yes, we do, sir.

398
00:29:01.318 --> 00:29:03.772
Sailor, did you see
that plane go down?


399
00:29:03.776 --> 00:29:05.185
- Aye, sir.
- Redirect the Phelps


400
00:29:05.193 --> 00:29:06.351
- to collect that crew.
- Aye sir,


401
00:29:06.359 --> 00:29:07.848
redirecting to Phelps.

402
00:29:07.859 --> 00:29:09.347
We've been very successful
so far, sir,


403
00:29:09.359 --> 00:29:10.973
but we can't let ourselves
be distracted


404
00:29:10.985 --> 00:29:12.473
with rescue missions.

405
00:29:12.484 --> 00:29:13.814
Successful?

406
00:29:13.818 --> 00:29:15.556
We launched 32 planes.

407
00:29:15.568 --> 00:29:17.057
All of six have returned.

408
00:29:17.068 --> 00:29:18.931
And that is unfortunate,

409
00:29:18.943 --> 00:29:21.397
but what an excellent ratio
of return for three carriers.


410
00:29:21.401 --> 00:29:23.606
Yorktown reporting
inbound enemy aircraft.


411
00:29:23.609 --> 00:29:25.347
Battle stations.
Battle stations.


412
00:29:25.359 --> 00:29:27.939
This complicates things a bit.

413
00:29:27.943 --> 00:29:30.057
I'm gonna go adjust the op plan.

414
00:29:30.068 --> 00:29:31.681
Unidentified aircraft inbound.

415
00:29:31.693 --> 00:29:33.306
Tell the bridge I'm on my way.

416
00:29:33.317 --> 00:29:35.272
- Aye, sir.
- All hands, general quarters.


417
00:29:35.277 --> 00:29:36.390
General quarters.

418
00:29:38.859 --> 00:29:40.722
That's what I'm telling you,
there isn't any


419
00:29:40.734 --> 00:29:42.939
radio navigation beacon
from anywhere but the island.


420
00:29:42.943 --> 00:29:44.897
Right. And then
so we use the island,


421
00:29:44.901 --> 00:29:47.480
find where we are, and then
where the enemy fleet is.


422
00:29:47.484 --> 00:29:49.598
Which we don't know
because they ain't filing


423
00:29:49.609 --> 00:29:51.438
no navigational plans with us.

424
00:29:51.442 --> 00:29:53.102
We know where they were,
so that's where we 're going.


425
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:54.689
But we don't know
where our carriers are.


426
00:29:54.693 --> 00:29:56.228
How are we gonna triangulate

427
00:29:56.235 --> 00:29:57.769
with only two points
of reference?


428
00:29:57.776 --> 00:29:59.514
Bi-angulate,
is that even a thing?


429
00:29:59.526 --> 00:30:01.106
Just gonna have to go
in a search pattern.


430
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:02.473
- Search pattern?
- T here's got to be,


431
00:30:02.484 --> 00:30:04.518
like, 200 miles of water.

432
00:30:04.526 --> 00:30:07.231
Every damn day.

433
00:30:09.151 --> 00:30:10.639
Pags, could you hop down here

434
00:30:10.651 --> 00:30:13.731
before I put my 45
in my mouth, please?


435
00:30:13.734 --> 00:30:15.018
You got it, sir.

436
00:30:19.235 --> 00:30:20.439
- All right.
- Why don't we just ask


437
00:30:20.442 --> 00:30:21.441
where to search?

438
00:30:23.026 --> 00:30:26.264
We're already outside
our mission search area.


439
00:30:26.276 --> 00:30:28.265
If we ask where to search,

440
00:30:28.276 --> 00:30:29.685
they're just gonna tell us
to search


441
00:30:29.693 --> 00:30:31.682
the mission search area.

442
00:30:31.693 --> 00:30:33.932
Besides, if the beacon's off,
they ain't gonna answer anyways.


443
00:30:33.943 --> 00:30:37.148
Christ, Mansfield, will you
shut up and make some coffee?


444
00:30:37.151 --> 00:30:39.685
Listening to you is making
everybody in this boat stupider.


445
00:30:39.693 --> 00:30:41.272
All right, Nusbaum,

446
00:30:41.276 --> 00:30:43.186
where's the enemy fleet's
last known?


447
00:30:43.193 --> 00:30:44.226
Right here.

448
00:30:45.901 --> 00:30:47.560
Right there?

449
00:30:47.568 --> 00:30:49.227
If we sunk three carriers,
we're gonna see smoke,


450
00:30:49.234 --> 00:30:51.689
we're gonna see debris,
we follow the party,


451
00:30:51.693 --> 00:30:53.682
we head back to Midway
in circles,


452
00:30:53.693 --> 00:30:55.272
we won't see any Jap carriers,

453
00:30:55.276 --> 00:30:57.686
but we might find
a pilot or two.


454
00:30:57.693 --> 00:31:00.523
- Good idea.
- I'm full of them.


455
00:31:00.526 --> 00:31:02.604
Be a doll, send the coffee up
when it's done, yeah?


456
00:31:09.985 --> 00:31:11.974
On deck, starboard 1.

457
00:31:11.985 --> 00:31:14.769
Leave the wheel and look out.

458
00:31:14.776 --> 00:31:17.480
The situation on Yorktown
is still developing,


459
00:31:17.484 --> 00:31:20.188
but they've taken at least
two torpedoes amidships


460
00:31:20.192 --> 00:31:22.182
and listing to port.

461
00:31:22.192 --> 00:31:24.647
Buckmaster's considering
abandoning her.


462
00:31:24.651 --> 00:31:26.264
That'll be up to Fletcher.

463
00:31:28.151 --> 00:31:29.889
What about her planes?

464
00:31:29.901 --> 00:31:31.685
They took a shellacking,
same as us.


465
00:31:31.693 --> 00:31:33.773
But luck would have it
Fletcher sent the remaining SBDs


466
00:31:33.776 --> 00:31:35.981
out on patrol
right before the attack.


467
00:31:35.985 --> 00:31:38.189
Well, obviously
there's a carrier or two


468
00:31:38.192 --> 00:31:40.056
still lurking about.

469
00:31:40.068 --> 00:31:42.772
Let the scouts find the enemy.

470
00:31:42.776 --> 00:31:45.435
McClusky did not have kind words
to say about Captain Browning.


471
00:31:45.442 --> 00:31:48.226
No, I don't expect he would.

472
00:31:49.776 --> 00:31:53.230
I want the planes on standby,
ready to go.


473
00:31:53.234 --> 00:31:54.894
Scouting 6 and the rest
of the Bomber remnants


474
00:31:54.901 --> 00:31:56.810
are being fit for action.

475
00:31:56.818 --> 00:31:59.181
Earl Gallaher is eager
to get in the fight.


476
00:31:59.192 --> 00:32:01.147
When the scouts find them,

477
00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:02.980
I want you to point the "E"
into the wind


478
00:32:02.985 --> 00:32:04.348
and get the planes in the sky.

479
00:32:04.359 --> 00:32:06.098
Aye, aye, sir.

480
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:09.223
All stations report
when manned and ready.


481
00:32:19.568 --> 00:32:22.523
Hey, Bennett, sir,
turn to starboard 30 degrees.


482
00:32:22.526 --> 00:32:24.355
The guys are spotting
oil slicks and debris.


483
00:32:31.026 --> 00:32:32.810
Yeah, I see 'em too.

484
00:32:32.818 --> 00:32:35.102
All right, boys,
keep your eyes peeled.


485
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.939
Look for anybody
happy to see us.


486
00:32:51.317 --> 00:32:53.522
Lee, wake up.

487
00:32:56.026 --> 00:32:57.264
Lee, get up.

488
00:32:58.818 --> 00:33:02.431
Lee, wake up, buddy.

489
00:33:02.442 --> 00:33:03.931
I got two more minutes left.

490
00:33:03.943 --> 00:33:06.101
Wake up, buddy, come on.

491
00:33:06.109 --> 00:33:08.974
Wait your turn.

492
00:33:11.693 --> 00:33:13.227
Sorry. Sorry.

493
00:33:13.234 --> 00:33:16.394
Sorry.

494
00:33:16.401 --> 00:33:17.400
I'm sorry.

495
00:33:20.859 --> 00:33:23.393
- Sorry.
- I was having a dream.


496
00:33:23.401 --> 00:33:26.435
I was in a bath

497
00:33:26.442 --> 00:33:28.101
with a beautiful Hawaiian girl.

498
00:33:30.818 --> 00:33:32.397
No kidding?

499
00:33:32.401 --> 00:33:35.973
It was hot... with bubbles.

500
00:33:39.985 --> 00:33:41.894
You're in a piss-warm
ocean with me.


501
00:33:44.234 --> 00:33:45.848
Let me get that patched up.

502
00:33:47.484 --> 00:33:49.019
No offense, sir...

503
00:33:51.359 --> 00:33:53.268
but I'd prefer my dream.

504
00:33:55.276 --> 00:33:57.265
I liked your dream better too.

505
00:33:58.734 --> 00:34:00.723
I'll have what you're having.

506
00:34:03.234 --> 00:34:05.314
Any sign of a pickup?

507
00:34:08.442 --> 00:34:11.977
No. I saw a few aircraft
flying overhead,


508
00:34:11.985 --> 00:34:15.314
but I think it was just a PBY.

509
00:34:15.317 --> 00:34:16.772
I don't know.

510
00:34:19.651 --> 00:34:21.480
No Japs out looking?

511
00:34:21.484 --> 00:34:23.188
No, we sunk their carriers.

512
00:34:23.192 --> 00:34:25.476
They got bigger problems.

513
00:34:28.192 --> 00:34:29.681
Well, the Japs never know

514
00:34:29.693 --> 00:34:32.727
when they've been licked,
though, so...


515
00:34:32.734 --> 00:34:35.063
we're gonna have to just sit
here tight for a while, okay?


516
00:34:35.067 --> 00:34:36.272
Okay.

517
00:34:39.609 --> 00:34:43.063
The aid kit went down
with everything else.


518
00:34:43.067 --> 00:34:44.431
We got to make do.

519
00:34:47.067 --> 00:34:49.852
It's fine
until the salt hits it,


520
00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:53.143
and then it burns down
to my fingers and toes.


521
00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:54.605
All right.

522
00:34:54.609 --> 00:34:56.222
I'm gonna tie it up
real tight, okay?


523
00:34:56.234 --> 00:34:57.313
- Okay.
- All right?


524
00:34:57.317 --> 00:34:59.351
- Okay.
- All right.


525
00:34:59.359 --> 00:35:01.643
All right. Here.

526
00:35:01.651 --> 00:35:03.480
Bite down on this.

527
00:35:03.484 --> 00:35:05.063
All right. All right.

528
00:35:05.067 --> 00:35:07.431
This is gonna sting
just a little.


529
00:35:07.442 --> 00:35:08.976
All right.

530
00:35:08.984 --> 00:35:11.724
All right on three, here we go.

531
00:35:12.901 --> 00:35:15.935
One, two.

532
00:35:18.693 --> 00:35:21.523
Aah!

533
00:35:29.067 --> 00:35:31.056
Okay. Is that better?

534
00:35:31.067 --> 00:35:32.602
Feel better?

535
00:35:32.609 --> 00:35:34.563
Mm-hmm.

536
00:35:34.568 --> 00:35:35.932
You okay?

537
00:35:44.317 --> 00:35:46.476
Think they'll let us go home
after this?


538
00:35:48.776 --> 00:35:52.064
I just... I just want to go home.

539
00:35:55.442 --> 00:35:57.522
I just want to see my mom again.

540
00:35:57.526 --> 00:35:59.480
You will.

541
00:35:59.484 --> 00:36:00.689
They'll send us home.

542
00:36:01.818 --> 00:36:07.481
A little shore leave,
we'll be good as new.


543
00:36:07.484 --> 00:36:08.972
They'll send us back...

544
00:36:10.734 --> 00:36:12.268
we'll have a parade.

545
00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.514
There'll be hula girls...

546
00:36:18.484 --> 00:36:20.814
poker chips.

547
00:36:20.818 --> 00:36:23.807
There'll be leis

548
00:36:23.818 --> 00:36:27.648
all the way down Hotel Street.

549
00:36:27.651 --> 00:36:29.105
It's gonna be great.

550
00:36:31.317 --> 00:36:35.180
First round... is on me.

551
00:36:35.192 --> 00:36:38.147
Nah, nah.

552
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:40.639
To hell with that.

553
00:36:40.651 --> 00:36:42.105
First round's on McClusky.

554
00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:46.059
He owes us that much.

555
00:36:46.276 --> 00:36:47.435
Fine, then.

556
00:36:54.818 --> 00:36:56.306
Are those ours?

557
00:36:59.609 --> 00:37:02.564
Definitely. Definitely.

558
00:37:02.568 --> 00:37:04.431
At least 20 of them.

559
00:37:04.442 --> 00:37:05.976
Hey!

560
00:37:05.984 --> 00:37:07.938
Lee, Lee, Lee.

561
00:37:07.942 --> 00:37:09.147
Down here!

562
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:10.149
Hey.

563
00:37:11.984 --> 00:37:13.938
Lee, Lee!

564
00:37:13.942 --> 00:37:15.477
They're too high.

565
00:37:17.484 --> 00:37:19.188
They can't hear us.
They can't see us.


566
00:37:20.359 --> 00:37:21.518
They can't hear us.

567
00:37:23.067 --> 00:37:24.772
They're probably too busy.

568
00:37:30.526 --> 00:37:32.731
Another flattop, you think?

569
00:37:32.734 --> 00:37:35.222
Yeah.

570
00:37:35.234 --> 00:37:36.518
I hope so.

571
00:37:46.192 --> 00:37:48.805
They got it.

572
00:37:48.817 --> 00:37:51.648
Yeah.

573
00:37:51.651 --> 00:37:53.139
They got it.

574
00:37:56.817 --> 00:38:00.602
- They got it.
- They got it.


575
00:38:23.192 --> 00:38:25.522
Holy Christ on a T-bone steak!

576
00:38:25.526 --> 00:38:27.230
Hey, boys, I think we got one.

577
00:38:27.234 --> 00:38:29.143
- English, Mansfield.
- Man in the water


578
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:31.104
floating on his back.
We just flew over them.


579
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:34.098
Boys are cheering
about needles in a haystack.


580
00:38:34.109 --> 00:38:35.893
- One of ours?
- Uh, it's hard to tell.


581
00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.730
Spread the word.

582
00:38:37.734 --> 00:38:39.597
Turn her around
and bring her down.


583
00:38:58.942 --> 00:39:01.306
It's a little too rough
to set down.


584
00:39:01.317 --> 00:39:03.306
Yeah,
I'm thinking the same thing.


585
00:39:03.317 --> 00:39:05.101
- Let's do over-under.
- Yeah.


586
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:06.972
Not good. I just hope
we don't hit those swells


587
00:39:06.984 --> 00:39:08.473
like a sack of crap
against the wall.


588
00:39:08.484 --> 00:39:10.143
I'm not particularly comfortable

589
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:11.639
- leaving that guy behind.
- Me, either.


590
00:39:11.651 --> 00:39:13.014
Just pointing out
we might not be taking off


591
00:39:13.025 --> 00:39:14.514
for a while once we pick him up.

592
00:39:14.526 --> 00:39:16.730
It'll give you a chance
to work on your tan.


593
00:39:16.733 --> 00:39:18.438
I'll let the boys know.

594
00:39:18.442 --> 00:39:20.556
All right, boys, listen up.

595
00:39:20.568 --> 00:39:22.102
Water is looking a little
rough down there.


596
00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:23.847
- Break.
- I got some bad news too.


597
00:39:23.858 --> 00:39:26.188
We got a bogey back here,
coming right up our tailpipe.


598
00:39:26.192 --> 00:39:28.647
- What is it?
- Don't know.


599
00:39:28.651 --> 00:39:30.514
It's flying slow,
might be a Dave.


600
00:39:30.526 --> 00:39:31.730
Oh, that's a biplane.

601
00:39:31.733 --> 00:39:33.142
Can you not tell
that's a biplane?


602
00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:35.013
- It's in and out of clouds.
- Hold on.


603
00:39:39.651 --> 00:39:41.889
It's a Zero. It's a Zero.

604
00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.435
- Nus, mark where we are.
- Got it.


605
00:39:43.442 --> 00:39:45.431
Mansfield, make yourself useful

606
00:39:45.442 --> 00:39:46.976
and drop that guy a boat
and some crackers.


607
00:39:46.984 --> 00:39:49.314
- Aye, aye.
- Everybody else hang on,


608
00:39:49.317 --> 00:39:52.101
whatever prayers you were
saving for a special occasion,


609
00:39:52.109 --> 00:39:53.518
now would be a good time
to use them.


610
00:39:53.526 --> 00:39:54.889
Oh, Jesus Christ.

611
00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:57.014
- I can't see him.
- Bogey coming on at six,


612
00:39:57.025 --> 00:39:58.854
- I can't get a bead on him.
- No. I can't...


613
00:39:58.858 --> 00:40:00.393
I don't know where he is,
I can't see him.


614
00:40:00.401 --> 00:40:02.119
- Smokey, you got him.
- He's gaining on us.


615
00:40:09.192 --> 00:40:10.976
How's that boat coming,
Mansfield?


616
00:40:10.984 --> 00:40:12.268
Working on it.

617
00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:14.230
Just make another pass.

618
00:40:14.234 --> 00:40:16.018
Boat's away, skipper. Not sure

619
00:40:16.025 --> 00:40:17.639
if we dropped it anywhere
near that poor bastard.


620
00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:19.480
That's why they invented
swimming, Mansfield.


621
00:40:19.484 --> 00:40:21.097
We may be racing him for it

622
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:22.867
if we don't get the hell
away from that Zero.


623
00:40:27.609 --> 00:40:29.313
God damn it, where is he?

624
00:40:29.317 --> 00:40:30.976
I just spotted him
headed upstairs.


625
00:40:30.984 --> 00:40:33.189
That asshole's gonna hit us
from above.


626
00:40:33.192 --> 00:40:34.556
That's not good.

627
00:40:34.568 --> 00:40:36.522
All right, boys,
eyes to the skies.


628
00:40:36.526 --> 00:40:39.390
You see a meatball, you set
your sights right on him.


629
00:40:56.109 --> 00:40:58.893
- Whoo! He's breaking off!
- Way to go, Smokey!


630
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:02.105
Hey you scared him off, Smokey.

631
00:41:02.109 --> 00:41:03.564
Champion machine gunner
of Honolulu,


632
00:41:03.568 --> 00:41:04.646
you're damn right I did.

633
00:41:07.984 --> 00:41:08.983
Skipper.

634
00:41:10.317 --> 00:41:11.805
We took a few rounds
in the wings,


635
00:41:11.817 --> 00:41:13.646
maybe a pontoon.

636
00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:15.355
We should check it out
while we still got sunlight.


637
00:41:15.359 --> 00:41:16.767
Set us down, yeah?

638
00:41:16.775 --> 00:41:19.264
I'll get some distance
to put her down.


639
00:41:19.276 --> 00:41:20.810
Banks, you okay?

640
00:41:20.817 --> 00:41:22.181
Yeah.

641
00:41:22.192 --> 00:41:23.896
Got any clean drawers
back there?


642
00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:25.638
I'll take a look.

643
00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:27.684
Hey, Champion Machine Gunner
of Honolulu


644
00:41:27.692 --> 00:41:29.181
ain't got dick to do with that.

645
00:41:29.192 --> 00:41:31.021
That Zero had us dead to rights.

646
00:41:31.025 --> 00:41:33.230
He chose to go play
somewhere else in a real hurw.


647
00:41:33.234 --> 00:41:35.643
Oh, yeah, we know.

648
00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:37.514
But let Smokey have his moment.

649
00:41:37.526 --> 00:41:38.764
If you say so.

650
00:42:10.817 --> 00:42:13.022
What's that noise?

651
00:42:13.025 --> 00:42:14.809
I don't know.

652
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:20.814
Maybe a ship alarm.

653
00:42:20.817 --> 00:42:23.681
It sounds that,
kind of, funny on the water.


654
00:42:23.692 --> 00:42:27.105
Sound travels real
far, and I'm not sure.


655
00:42:28.567 --> 00:42:30.521
I wish it would stop.

656
00:42:30.525 --> 00:42:32.605
Yeah. Me, too.

657
00:42:41.984 --> 00:42:43.018
Sir.

658
00:42:45.025 --> 00:42:46.309
Norman.

659
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:49.314
What?

660
00:42:49.317 --> 00:42:51.476
Call me Norman.

661
00:42:54.567 --> 00:42:55.806
Norman.

662
00:42:55.817 --> 00:42:56.816
Yeah.

663
00:42:59.858 --> 00:43:01.642
I'm thirsty.

664
00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:03.355
Me, too.

665
00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:08.480
I guess we know what
the Ancient Mariner felt like.


666
00:43:08.483 --> 00:43:09.938
Who?

667
00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:14.514
It's a poem.

668
00:43:14.525 --> 00:43:17.730
It's about this sailor
who shoots an albatross.


669
00:43:18.984 --> 00:43:20.847
This bird leads him
out of the Arctic,


670
00:43:20.858 --> 00:43:24.222
and he shoots it
with a crossbow.


671
00:43:26.525 --> 00:43:28.389
Well, why did he do that?

672
00:43:30.817 --> 00:43:34.102
You know,
it's not particularly clear


673
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:35.847
why he does it in the poem.

674
00:43:37.483 --> 00:43:39.813
The rest of the crew
gets pissed at him


675
00:43:39.817 --> 00:43:42.352
because they thought the bird
brought the wind with it.


676
00:43:44.984 --> 00:43:49.144
They tied this albatross
around the neck of the sailor.


677
00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:52.310
He wears this
rotting bird around,


678
00:43:52.317 --> 00:43:54.976
hoping it'll bring back
the wind with his suffering,


679
00:43:54.984 --> 00:43:57.688
but it doesn't come.

680
00:44:01.192 --> 00:44:03.726
Instead, the crew
starts dying one by one...


681
00:44:06.067 --> 00:44:08.147
until he's the sole survivor.

682
00:44:10.567 --> 00:44:12.556
I know it doesn't sound
like a good story,


683
00:44:12.567 --> 00:44:18.477
but it's a parable of sorts.

684
00:44:21.942 --> 00:44:25.181
In the end, this poor bastard
suffers and suffers.


685
00:44:26.608 --> 00:44:31.647
In his suffering,
he's redeemed by God


686
00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:33.185
and rescued.

687
00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:43.105
Hang in there, Lee.

688
00:44:45.733 --> 00:44:46.892
You're gonna be okay.

689
00:44:49.567 --> 00:44:51.476
We both are.

690
00:45:20.942 --> 00:45:22.476
Admiral, sir.

691
00:45:22.483 --> 00:45:24.063
Good morning, Captain Browning.

692
00:45:24.067 --> 00:45:25.771
Last night, the submarine Tambor

693
00:45:25.775 --> 00:45:28.434
reported the location
and bearing of several contacts.


694
00:45:28.441 --> 00:45:31.101
I can send word to Commanders
McClusky and Gallaher


695
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:33.472
to ready their pilots
to launch at first light.


696
00:45:33.483 --> 00:45:35.313
Let them sleep.

697
00:45:35.317 --> 00:45:37.101
Midway has their scouts
in the air,


698
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:40.018
and if that turns out
to be a landing force,


699
00:45:40.025 --> 00:45:43.354
we will need to stay put
to cover the island.


700
00:45:43.358 --> 00:45:45.268
And if it is a fifth carrier?

701
00:45:45.276 --> 00:45:48.813
We will engage,
once we get confirmation.


702
00:45:48.817 --> 00:45:55.522
I will not make the same mistake
as yesterday and overextend.


703
00:45:55.525 --> 00:45:56.980
Yes, sir.

704
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:29.063
Oh, good.

705
00:46:29.067 --> 00:46:31.181
They remembered my wake-up call.

706
00:46:32.733 --> 00:46:35.268
I haven't seen
the room service to...


707
00:46:35.275 --> 00:46:36.980
bring me my pancakes,

708
00:46:36.984 --> 00:46:38.597
orange juice... Lee, Lee.

709
00:46:38.608 --> 00:46:41.063
Lee! Lee!

710
00:46:42.358 --> 00:46:44.893
Lee!

711
00:46:51.067 --> 00:46:54.271
Don't go running off on me
like that, Lee.


712
00:46:54.275 --> 00:46:55.855
Scared the crap out of me.

713
00:46:55.858 --> 00:46:59.476
You know me, always running off

714
00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:01.813
chasing tail.

715
00:47:01.817 --> 00:47:04.681
- Yeah?
- You found some tail out here?


716
00:47:05.984 --> 00:47:07.143
Mermaid.

717
00:47:11.441 --> 00:47:12.646
Let me check that wound.

718
00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:15.060
Hmm. It's okay.

719
00:47:15.067 --> 00:47:16.066
I'm okay.

720
00:47:18.192 --> 00:47:21.147
No, it's fine.
It's getting better.


721
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:23.934
Let me check
the damn wound, Lee.


722
00:47:33.192 --> 00:47:34.430
Yeah. You're right.

723
00:47:36.192 --> 00:47:37.225
It is getting better.

724
00:47:38.942 --> 00:47:40.225
I told you.

725
00:47:50.817 --> 00:47:52.646
Keep those eyes open, all right?

726
00:47:54.316 --> 00:47:57.225
I need you to help me
spot our pickup.


727
00:47:57.233 --> 00:48:00.313
I'm no good without my coffee.

728
00:48:00.316 --> 00:48:01.976
So I'm counting on you.

729
00:48:01.984 --> 00:48:03.597
I'm on it.

730
00:48:03.608 --> 00:48:04.847
I'm on it, sir.

731
00:48:21.525 --> 00:48:23.184
- You got to be cheating.
- You beat me four times.


732
00:48:23.191 --> 00:48:24.646
The odds are not in your favor.

733
00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:26.139
- Caroll, you...
- Good morning, fellas.


734
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:28.059
- Morning, Nus.
- Morning, Nus,


735
00:48:28.067 --> 00:48:29.555
The boys watered and fed?

736
00:48:29.567 --> 00:48:31.601
- Aye, sir.
- You ready for another day


737
00:48:31.608 --> 00:48:32.972
of being shot at by Zeros?

738
00:48:32.984 --> 00:48:34.472
- Nope.
- Hell, nope.


739
00:48:34.483 --> 00:48:36.972
- All right.
- Well, boner appetite.


740
00:48:39.275 --> 00:48:41.980
Okay. This... Are you even...

741
00:48:41.984 --> 00:48:43.438
- Do you even hear it?
- Hey,


742
00:48:43.441 --> 00:48:45.646
NAS Midway
just sent orders our way.


743
00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:48.139
We're to scout and report
any and all enemy surface ships


744
00:48:48.149 --> 00:48:51.730
we come in contact with.
Relay positions.


745
00:48:51.733 --> 00:48:53.642
We're already doing that.

746
00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:55.059
And now we're still doing it,

747
00:48:55.067 --> 00:48:58.305
and we got a search area
defined.


748
00:48:58.316 --> 00:49:00.305
All right. Well, tell the boys
to weigh anchor.


749
00:49:00.316 --> 00:49:04.146
And, Nus, you just...

750
00:49:04.149 --> 00:49:06.183
just keep on doing your thing.

751
00:49:20.483 --> 00:49:22.392
Okay. Here we go.

752
00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.229
Possible main body fleet sighted

753
00:49:24.233 --> 00:49:26.313
700 miles, 92 degrees off Midway

754
00:49:26.316 --> 00:49:28.600
bearing 262 degrees.

755
00:49:28.608 --> 00:49:30.597
Two carriers,
four light cruisers,


756
00:49:30.608 --> 00:49:32.312
two heavies, six destroyers,

757
00:49:32.316 --> 00:49:33.805
eight troop transporters.

758
00:49:54.775 --> 00:49:57.229
- Sharks. Sharks.
- What?


759
00:49:57.233 --> 00:49:58.472
Where?

760
00:49:58.483 --> 00:50:00.597
- Where?
- It's behind you.


761
00:50:03.483 --> 00:50:04.597
Oh, God.

762
00:50:04.608 --> 00:50:05.607
Please, no, please.

763
00:50:10.233 --> 00:50:12.018
- It's a ray.
- A ray shark?


764
00:50:13.275 --> 00:50:14.684
No.

765
00:50:14.692 --> 00:50:16.851
Manta ray.

766
00:50:16.858 --> 00:50:19.221
Does it eat humans?

767
00:50:21.483 --> 00:50:23.096
Not that I'm aware of.

768
00:50:26.066 --> 00:50:28.271
They're all over
the waters off Pearl.


769
00:50:30.191 --> 00:50:32.100
When we get back,
I'll take you snorkeling,


770
00:50:32.108 --> 00:50:35.313
and you can see one up close.

771
00:50:40.567 --> 00:50:42.806
Thank you.

772
00:50:42.817 --> 00:50:46.851
But I respectfully... decline.

773
00:50:50.191 --> 00:50:51.805
You see,

774
00:50:51.817 --> 00:50:57.397
I just saw one
too close for comfort,


775
00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:00.059
and I think I'm gonna
swear off all things.


776
00:51:00.066 --> 00:51:02.646
H20 after this.

777
00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:04.229
You say that now,

778
00:51:04.233 --> 00:51:07.597
but no one likes a landlubber.

779
00:51:09.275 --> 00:51:10.514
Hey.

780
00:51:13.483 --> 00:51:17.188
I'm from Sandusky, okay?

781
00:51:18.525 --> 00:51:21.855
Grew up on Erie.

782
00:51:23.233 --> 00:51:29.263
Nobody...
is gonna call me a landlubber...


783
00:51:30.983 --> 00:51:35.805
not even you... sir.

784
00:51:37.316 --> 00:51:40.555
That's a lake, Keaney.

785
00:51:40.567 --> 00:51:42.476
It doesn't count.

786
00:51:45.525 --> 00:51:48.434
Aren't you from Mississippi?

787
00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:50.684
Huh?

788
00:51:50.692 --> 00:51:52.646
River boy.

789
00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:54.479
Hell, no.

790
00:51:54.483 --> 00:51:56.813
I'm from Hawaii.

791
00:51:56.817 --> 00:51:59.055
And so are you, if anybody asks.

792
00:52:00.316 --> 00:52:01.600
Yeah.

793
00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:04.434
Well...

794
00:52:05.983 --> 00:52:07.438
aloha.

795
00:52:11.692 --> 00:52:13.180
That's the spirit.

796
00:52:14.983 --> 00:52:16.722
Now where were we?

797
00:52:38.567 --> 00:52:40.806
Obviously you don't understand.

798
00:52:40.817 --> 00:52:43.556
Let me try and explain it
again in simpler terms.


799
00:52:43.567 --> 00:52:45.396
Suicide Mission.

800
00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:48.605
Earl and I did the math
the second we got these orders.


801
00:52:48.608 --> 00:52:50.597
Gentlemen, clear the room.

802
00:53:00.692 --> 00:53:02.772
Commander McClusky,
is there a problem?


803
00:53:02.775 --> 00:53:04.434
They're objecting
to the mission, sir.


804
00:53:04.441 --> 00:53:06.680
Apparently,
a heavily damaged carrier


805
00:53:06.692 --> 00:53:08.180
with no ability
to launch aircraft


806
00:53:08.191 --> 00:53:09.726
is proving to be
a formidable foe.


807
00:53:09.733 --> 00:53:11.346
Maybe so,

808
00:53:11.358 --> 00:53:13.722
but I believe I was asking
Commander McClusky.


809
00:53:13.733 --> 00:53:17.392
He has us flying 240 miles
to the target


810
00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.184
with thousand-pound bombs.

811
00:53:19.191 --> 00:53:21.020
The ordinance is to assure
destruction of the target.


812
00:53:21.024 --> 00:53:22.887
Lugging a thousand pounder
that far,


813
00:53:22.899 --> 00:53:25.434
you're sentencing those men
to ditch in the sea.


814
00:53:25.441 --> 00:53:27.555
We don't have enough gas
to get home.


815
00:53:27.567 --> 00:53:29.476
Per the specs of the Dauntless,

816
00:53:29.483 --> 00:53:31.517
you'll have enough fuel
to complete the mission.


817
00:53:31.525 --> 00:53:34.389
Sure, if the carrier
sits there quietly


818
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.229
and allow us to slowly fly up,

819
00:53:36.233 --> 00:53:39.979
drop our payload,
and slowly fly away,


820
00:53:39.983 --> 00:53:41.846
but what the hell
are the chances of that?


821
00:53:43.775 --> 00:53:45.479
Commander McClusky
and the pilots


822
00:53:45.483 --> 00:53:47.312
know the planes
better than anyone.


823
00:53:47.316 --> 00:53:50.850
And I'm as eager as the next guy
to sink another carrier,


824
00:53:50.857 --> 00:53:54.642
but not at the expense
of more men in the water.


825
00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:56.388
Re-work the plan?

826
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.639
Allow the planes
to land on the deck,


827
00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:01.513
not the ocean.

828
00:54:04.358 --> 00:54:05.357
Aye, sir.

829
00:54:11.275 --> 00:54:12.764
Get your men ready for action.

830
00:54:12.775 --> 00:54:15.229
- Thank you, sir.
- Yes, sir.


831
00:54:32.525 --> 00:54:33.979
No.

832
00:54:36.108 --> 00:54:38.142
No. No.

833
00:54:38.149 --> 00:54:40.138
I'm here, Lee.

834
00:54:40.149 --> 00:54:41.183
I'm here.

835
00:54:46.692 --> 00:54:47.771
I don't wanna...

836
00:54:56.024 --> 00:55:02.480
I don't... I don't wanna...
be in the...


837
00:55:02.483 --> 00:55:05.096
In the water anymore.

838
00:55:08.816 --> 00:55:10.271
I don't, either.

839
00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:16.434
I can't... I can't wait anymore.

840
00:55:21.899 --> 00:55:23.729
- He-help me.
- All right.


841
00:55:27.066 --> 00:55:29.770
- I'm trying to, Lee.
- I'm trying to.


842
00:55:31.441 --> 00:55:35.146
What can I do so you don't drop?

843
00:55:35.149 --> 00:55:36.684
Please tell me.

844
00:55:39.899 --> 00:55:42.513
God, I wanna... I wanna go.

845
00:55:47.441 --> 00:55:49.770
Come on, Lee,
just hang in there, man.


846
00:55:49.774 --> 00:55:51.808
Just hang in there, buddy.

847
00:55:51.816 --> 00:55:53.225
Just hang in there.

848
00:55:54.899 --> 00:55:56.933
I
-I need to go.

849
00:55:58.108 --> 00:55:59.767
Just hang in there.

850
00:56:04.483 --> 00:56:06.062
I don't need to wait.

851
00:56:06.066 --> 00:56:10.804
Back home... to my mom.

852
00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:23.434
Don't leave me. Don't.

853
00:56:58.816 --> 00:57:01.476
- Hey.
- Is anybody else seeing this?


854
00:57:01.483 --> 00:57:04.017
Yep! Looks like
a couple dozen SBDs


855
00:57:04.024 --> 00:57:05.978
and some Wildcats.

856
00:57:05.983 --> 00:57:06.971
Guess they found those carriers

857
00:57:06.983 --> 00:57:08.812
they're looking for.

858
00:57:08.816 --> 00:57:10.645
I think that's our cue
to go back to Midway.


859
00:57:10.649 --> 00:57:12.263
Fuel's looking a little low.

860
00:57:12.275 --> 00:57:14.979
We got some Jerry cans
left with gas,


861
00:57:14.983 --> 00:57:16.687
but showers and real chow

862
00:57:16.691 --> 00:57:18.771
are sounding mighty
good right about now.


863
00:57:18.774 --> 00:57:21.729
- Yes, sir.
- Let's come around and head home.


864
00:57:41.233 --> 00:57:42.232
Lee.

865
00:57:43.441 --> 00:57:44.440
Look.

866
00:57:45.649 --> 00:57:47.638
Lee, they're gonna fly
right over us.


867
00:57:50.149 --> 00:57:51.188
Lee, they're gonna see us.

868
00:57:52.774 --> 00:57:54.559
Hey.

869
00:57:54.567 --> 00:57:57.476
Hey. Help!

870
00:57:57.483 --> 00:57:59.096
Help!

871
00:57:59.108 --> 00:58:02.142
We're down here! Hey.

872
00:58:02.149 --> 00:58:04.103
Help.

873
00:58:04.108 --> 00:58:05.971
We're down here! Help!

874
00:58:12.149 --> 00:58:14.479
They saw us, Lee.

875
00:58:14.483 --> 00:58:16.937
They had to.

876
00:58:16.941 --> 00:58:18.430
They flew right over us.

877
00:58:20.691 --> 00:58:22.600
Good. Good.

878
00:58:25.066 --> 00:58:26.065
Good.

879
00:58:31.233 --> 00:58:33.846
No, no, no, no.

880
00:58:33.857 --> 00:58:34.971
Lee.

881
00:58:34.983 --> 00:58:36.142
Hey. We're going home.

882
00:58:36.149 --> 00:58:37.853
We're going home.

883
00:58:37.857 --> 00:58:40.062
We're going home now.

884
00:58:40.066 --> 00:58:42.271
We're going back.

885
00:58:42.275 --> 00:58:43.389
Come on.

886
00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.229
Come on. Get up.

887
00:58:45.233 --> 00:58:47.517
Get up. We're okay.

888
00:58:47.525 --> 00:58:48.524
We're okay.

889
00:58:51.316 --> 00:58:53.679
Lee, we're safe.

890
00:58:53.691 --> 00:58:54.850
We're going home.

891
00:58:58.108 --> 00:59:00.188
Look, Lee. Please.

892
00:59:12.983 --> 00:59:14.596
Lee, I'm sorry.

893
00:59:16.983 --> 00:59:18.438
Don't leave me alone, Lee.

894
00:59:18.441 --> 00:59:20.724
Don't leave me out here alone.

895
00:59:41.441 --> 00:59:43.100
Next TAG up at 2130.

896
00:59:43.108 --> 00:59:44.096
Thank you, Petty Officer.

897
00:59:44.108 --> 00:59:45.222
Yes, sir.

898
00:59:47.149 --> 00:59:48.978
Admiral on the bridge!

899
00:59:48.983 --> 00:59:50.642
Henson,

900
00:59:50.649 --> 00:59:52.933
- turn on the running lights.
- Belay that.


901
00:59:52.941 --> 00:59:56.305
Admiral, we cannot turn on
the running lights.


902
00:59:56.316 --> 00:59:58.350
These waters are thick
with Japanese submarines.


903
00:59:58.358 --> 00:59:59.596
We'd be broadcasting
our location


904
00:59:59.607 --> 01:00:00.891
to every eye for miles around.

905
01:00:00.899 --> 01:00:02.183
Including our pilots.

906
01:00:02.191 --> 01:00:04.396
Who are not experienced

907
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.558
or trained to land
on a carrier in the dark.


908
01:00:06.566 --> 01:00:11.979
Henson, light the whole ship up.

909
01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:13.972
Yes, sir.

910
01:00:13.983 --> 01:00:15.471
Petty Officer,

911
01:00:15.482 --> 01:00:17.437
light the ship
full deck and bow.


912
01:00:17.441 --> 01:00:18.975
Summon the Captain
to the bridge.


913
01:00:18.983 --> 01:00:19.982
Yes, sir.

914
01:00:21.191 --> 01:00:23.895
Henry, light the ship
full deck and bow.


915
01:00:23.899 --> 01:00:25.933
Yes, everything.

916
01:00:33.774 --> 01:00:35.933
There they are. Thank God.

917
01:00:41.941 --> 01:00:44.396
I hope you realize
what you're doing.


918
01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.355
I'm giving our pilots a chance
to land rather than crash.


919
01:00:48.358 --> 01:00:51.097
Thank you for your advice,
Mr. Browning.


920
01:00:51.108 --> 01:00:52.437
You are dismissed.

921
01:00:55.066 --> 01:00:56.065
Good night.

922
01:00:58.108 --> 01:00:59.267
Good night, sir.

923
01:01:06.191 --> 01:01:09.771
Okay, sailors,
keep your eyes open.


924
01:01:09.774 --> 01:01:12.263
We have planes
struggling to get home.


925
01:01:29.941 --> 01:01:32.645
Looks like the island
took a few licks.


926
01:01:32.649 --> 01:01:34.478
At least the dock's still here.

927
01:01:34.482 --> 01:01:37.562
Yeah. It would be
damn easy to find,


928
01:01:37.566 --> 01:01:39.146
even without a radio beacon.

929
01:01:40.732 --> 01:01:43.062
I think even some
of the airfield was on fire.


930
01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:47.226
Eh, the island was a shit hole
even before the Japs anyway.


931
01:01:47.233 --> 01:01:48.641
It looks like
we're all tied down.


932
01:01:48.649 --> 01:01:50.808
You boys need anything else
from me?


933
01:01:50.816 --> 01:01:53.226
No. I think we're good.

934
01:01:53.233 --> 01:01:55.142
We're just gonna see
what the skinny is


935
01:01:55.149 --> 01:01:56.512
on the situation.

936
01:01:56.524 --> 01:01:58.638
Go get yourself some grub.

937
01:01:58.649 --> 01:02:00.309
I wouldn't want to miss
Smokey's story


938
01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:02.679
how he took on the whole
Jap Navy on his own, right?


939
01:02:02.691 --> 01:02:05.226
I expect the full reenactment
from you.


940
01:02:05.233 --> 01:02:06.937
Yes, sir.

941
01:02:06.941 --> 01:02:08.725
Gentlemen. Boys. Skip.

942
01:02:11.482 --> 01:02:14.313
Boys, see you in the AM.

943
01:02:14.316 --> 01:02:16.395
Sir. Good to see you.

944
01:02:17.649 --> 01:02:19.478
- Sir.
- Good evening, chief.


945
01:02:19.482 --> 01:02:20.971
We've been out sightseeing.

946
01:02:20.983 --> 01:02:23.222
- We miss anything big?
- Not really.


947
01:02:23.233 --> 01:02:24.721
Just a little trouble
with the neighbors next door.


948
01:02:24.732 --> 01:02:26.141
Hmm, those little guys

949
01:02:26.149 --> 01:02:27.557
with the bad
decision-making skills?


950
01:02:27.566 --> 01:02:28.975
Yeah. Them's the ones.

951
01:02:28.983 --> 01:02:31.892
So what the hell happened here?

952
01:02:31.899 --> 01:02:34.104
Eh, the airfield's wrecked,

953
01:02:34.108 --> 01:02:35.892
but it could've been held
a lot worse.


954
01:02:35.899 --> 01:02:38.512
The Marines flew every fighter
they could get in the air


955
01:02:38.524 --> 01:02:40.387
and messed up
their formation up there,


956
01:02:40.399 --> 01:02:41.638
chased them off.

957
01:02:41.649 --> 01:02:42.763
They haven't been back since.

958
01:02:42.774 --> 01:02:44.763
And the more current events?

959
01:02:44.774 --> 01:02:46.979
That's a mixed bag
of good, bad, and FUBAR.


960
01:02:46.983 --> 01:02:48.972
It sounds about par
for the course.


961
01:02:48.983 --> 01:02:52.222
The good news is the Navy
scratched four Jap flattops.


962
01:02:52.233 --> 01:02:54.596
Bad news is the Yorktown
got blown to shit.


963
01:02:54.607 --> 01:02:57.641
She's still afloat,
but that's about it.


964
01:02:57.649 --> 01:02:58.979
And the FUBAR?

965
01:02:58.983 --> 01:03:01.471
Carrier planes were slaughtered

966
01:03:01.482 --> 01:03:03.721
after they dropped their bombs,

967
01:03:03.732 --> 01:03:05.516
especially the ones
from the Enterprise.


968
01:03:05.524 --> 01:03:07.104
How bad?

969
01:03:07.108 --> 01:03:08.892
Let's just say that there's
not enough pilots


970
01:03:08.899 --> 01:03:10.728
left on the Big "E"
to field a baseball team.


971
01:03:10.732 --> 01:03:13.436
You know, we were in the thick
of it earlier,


972
01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.429
and we saw plenty of SBDs
in the air then.


973
01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.303
Those were Hornet
and Yorktown birds


974
01:03:17.315 --> 01:03:18.724
flying off Enterprise.

975
01:03:21.983 --> 01:03:23.266
Are you okay, sir?

976
01:03:23.274 --> 01:03:28.054
Uh, yeah, I'm... okay.

977
01:03:28.066 --> 01:03:29.554
Thanks for the info, chief.

978
01:03:29.566 --> 01:03:31.226
- You got it.
- Thank you, gentlemen.


979
01:03:35.315 --> 01:03:36.679
Got it covered here?

980
01:03:36.691 --> 01:03:38.100
All right. Take it easy.

981
01:03:43.274 --> 01:03:45.433
Sailor, make fast these lines.

982
01:04:01.857 --> 01:04:03.470
Are you all right there,
skipper?


983
01:04:03.482 --> 01:04:06.391
Um, yeah.

984
01:04:08.983 --> 01:04:11.767
I have a lot of friends
on the Enterprise.


985
01:04:11.774 --> 01:04:15.104
Half of them were in my class
in Pensacola.


986
01:04:15.108 --> 01:04:16.221
Is that right?

987
01:04:16.232 --> 01:04:17.516
Yeah.

988
01:04:19.816 --> 01:04:24.517
Tom Schneider, Frank
Weber, Bill Ramsay...


989
01:04:25.691 --> 01:04:27.896
Norman Vandivier.

990
01:04:27.899 --> 01:04:30.558
- Vandivier?
- Yeah.


991
01:04:30.566 --> 01:04:32.976
No. I know Vandivier.

992
01:04:32.983 --> 01:04:35.813
He and I got into some, uh,
disagreements


993
01:04:35.816 --> 01:04:37.055
over darts and billiards

994
01:04:37.066 --> 01:04:38.395
back in the good old days
at Pearl.


995
01:04:38.399 --> 01:04:40.059
Yeah?

996
01:04:40.066 --> 01:04:42.770
Back in the good old days
before the Japs bombed us?


997
01:04:46.482 --> 01:04:47.481
Yeah.

998
01:04:52.649 --> 01:04:55.183
Didn't know you two were
in the same class together.


999
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:56.975
How did you guys become friends?

1000
01:04:56.983 --> 01:05:02.304
- Um...
- well, it was a positively frigid


1001
01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:05.179
Florida Christmas afternoon.

1002
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:06.975
We had just been given
holiday shore leave,


1003
01:05:06.983 --> 01:05:09.596
and, like all good pilot cadets,

1004
01:05:09.607 --> 01:05:11.391
we ended up at the closest bar

1005
01:05:11.399 --> 01:05:13.558
to celebrate
the spirit of the season.


1006
01:05:13.566 --> 01:05:16.270
- A time-honored tradition.
- Oh, yeah.


1007
01:05:16.274 --> 01:05:17.604
The place was packed.

1008
01:05:17.607 --> 01:05:19.062
There were aviators everywhere,

1009
01:05:19.066 --> 01:05:23.304
and, as it happens
in such situations,


1010
01:05:23.315 --> 01:05:26.100
me and old Norman, well,

1011
01:05:26.108 --> 01:05:28.596
we got to know each other
the old-fashioned way.


1012
01:05:30.108 --> 01:05:32.312
- Bar fight?
- No.


1013
01:05:32.315 --> 01:05:33.645
Whiskey, a little sugar,

1014
01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.100
- You're a goddamn laugh riot.
- You know that?


1015
01:05:38.108 --> 01:05:40.938
- Hey. It's true. It's true.
- Yeah. We hit it off.


1016
01:05:40.941 --> 01:05:43.055
We had plans to do our time

1017
01:05:43.066 --> 01:05:45.020
and then fly
beautiful, rich women


1018
01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:47.262
around the globe in a seaplane.

1019
01:05:49.732 --> 01:05:50.731
Globe?

1020
01:05:58.899 --> 01:06:00.728
Of course he's gonna scare
the hell out of the passengers


1021
01:06:00.732 --> 01:06:03.766
if he brings his dive bomber
experience to the endeavor.


1022
01:06:03.774 --> 01:06:05.433
So I'm thinking you make
a better flight engineer


1023
01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.020
- at this point.
- Yep.


1024
01:06:07.024 --> 01:06:10.387
Which means you can have
the co-pilot seat


1025
01:06:10.399 --> 01:06:11.854
if you can still stand me
after the war.


1026
01:06:11.857 --> 01:06:13.811
What about Pags?

1027
01:06:13.816 --> 01:06:16.350
We'll need a stewardess.

1028
01:06:18.024 --> 01:06:19.603
0h, Christ.

1029
01:06:19.607 --> 01:06:21.436
Shit, man.

1030
01:06:24.649 --> 01:06:26.808
It wasn't supposed to happen
like this,


1031
01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:29.021
everything going to shit
in one day.


1032
01:06:29.024 --> 01:06:30.728
Those Dauntless bombers
are tough.


1033
01:06:30.732 --> 01:06:32.721
We've seen them hit rough seas
at a hundred knots,


1034
01:06:32.732 --> 01:06:34.891
and the pilot and gunner
swim out without a scratch.


1035
01:06:34.899 --> 01:06:36.262
They've been out there
for three days,


1036
01:06:36.274 --> 01:06:38.183
and we're taking hot showers.

1037
01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:40.148
We should be out there
looking for them right now.


1038
01:06:41.024 --> 01:06:44.262
It's night. We're not gonna
find them in the dark.


1039
01:06:47.024 --> 01:06:49.103
Take a look at all
the bullet holes in our wings


1040
01:06:49.107 --> 01:06:51.141
and all that's gonna happen
tomorrow morning.


1041
01:06:51.148 --> 01:06:52.603
Just doesn't feel right.

1042
01:06:58.190 --> 01:07:00.179
Look, 90 get some chow
and a stiff drink.


1043
01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:01.770
I'll go report in,

1044
01:07:01.774 --> 01:07:04.183
see if I can't pump the RMs
for some intel.


1045
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:06.770
Maybe they'll know where
some of these guys went down.


1046
01:07:06.774 --> 01:07:09.228
All right. But I'm serious.

1047
01:07:09.232 --> 01:07:10.892
I want to be in the air
the second we're cleared.


1048
01:07:10.899 --> 01:07:13.057
I hear you.

1049
01:07:13.065 --> 01:07:14.725
I'll see what I can do
on the clearance side.


1050
01:07:14.732 --> 01:07:16.220
You get everybody drunk

1051
01:07:16.232 --> 01:07:18.391
and convince them
to sleep on the boat.


1052
01:07:18.399 --> 01:07:19.513
Deal.

1053
01:07:19.524 --> 01:07:21.308
Thanks, Caroll.

1054
01:07:21.315 --> 01:07:23.304
I mean it.

1055
01:07:23.315 --> 01:07:26.645
Aw, skipper,
getting me all misty eyed.


1056
01:07:45.482 --> 01:07:47.471
I always wanted to be a pilot.

1057
01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:51.596
I wanted to see the whole world.

1058
01:07:54.023 --> 01:07:55.933
So I joined the Navy.

1059
01:07:59.357 --> 01:08:02.346
When I went to Hawaii,

1060
01:08:02.357 --> 01:08:05.767
I knew that I was in paradise.
I never wanted to leave.


1061
01:08:09.649 --> 01:08:13.388
Was gonna do my time
for Uncle Sam,


1062
01:08:13.399 --> 01:08:16.763
fly around beautiful women
to exotic places.


1063
01:08:21.899 --> 01:08:24.558
This was not
how it was supposed to be.


1064
01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:35.888
Still, there are worse places to die.

1065
01:08:40.148 --> 01:08:43.228
Crystal clear ocean

1066
01:08:43.232 --> 01:08:45.391
under the beautiful stars...

1067
01:08:47.315 --> 01:08:48.974
with a friend.

1068
01:09:33.315 --> 01:09:35.770
See you on the other side, Lee.

1069
01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:38.012
- Admiral.
- Hmm.


1070
01:10:38.023 --> 01:10:39.852
Hornet reports completion
of their sortie,


1071
01:10:39.856 --> 01:10:42.311
having struck two heavy cruisers
with thousand-pound bombs.


1072
01:10:42.315 --> 01:10:44.770
That's good. Launch two scouts
to take photographs


1073
01:10:44.774 --> 01:10:46.887
of what remains
to the Japanese fleet.


1074
01:10:46.898 --> 01:10:48.307
Aye, sir.

1075
01:10:48.315 --> 01:10:50.804
George, any thoughts?

1076
01:10:50.815 --> 01:10:52.554
We are running low on fuel,

1077
01:10:52.566 --> 01:10:54.895
and we'll need to slow
to allow the Oilers to catch us.


1078
01:10:54.898 --> 01:10:57.433
When does Wake become a threat?

1079
01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:59.303
On our current course,

1080
01:10:59.315 --> 01:11:02.679
we could potentially be in range
of their land-based aircraft


1081
01:11:02.691 --> 01:11:04.020
by sometime this evening.

1082
01:11:06.148 --> 01:11:09.353
I don't feel the need to risk
any more lives or planes


1083
01:11:09.357 --> 01:11:12.187
to sink two heavily damaged
Japanese ships.


1084
01:11:12.190 --> 01:11:13.803
I concur.

1085
01:11:15.023 --> 01:11:16.886
Remain on course at speed

1086
01:11:16.898 --> 01:11:19.103
till we collect our planes,

1087
01:11:19.107 --> 01:11:21.016
- and then break our pursuit.
- Aye, sir.


1088
01:11:22.774 --> 01:11:24.137
Sir, perhaps...

1089
01:11:28.774 --> 01:11:29.773
Aye, sir.

1090
01:11:40.524 --> 01:11:43.808
And there was a Jap flag
painted on the bullet shield.


1091
01:11:43.815 --> 01:11:45.895
- What the hell?
- No, like a... like a kill.


1092
01:11:45.898 --> 01:11:47.683
Like, how the Wildcat pilots
paint kills


1093
01:11:47.691 --> 01:11:50.304
on the nose of their planes?
It was like that.


1094
01:11:50.315 --> 01:11:51.928
- Huh.
- Yeah, so,


1095
01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:53.645
apparently,
the Japs hit a hangar,


1096
01:11:53.649 --> 01:11:55.478
took out a few planes
on the ground.


1097
01:11:55.482 --> 01:11:57.186
Some Marine dumb-ass

1098
01:11:57.190 --> 01:11:59.099
lugged one
of the salvaged dual fifties


1099
01:11:59.107 --> 01:12:01.187
from, uh, one of the planes
over by the latrines


1100
01:12:01.190 --> 01:12:02.429
and set up shop.

1101
01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.974
Shot down a Zero.

1102
01:12:03.982 --> 01:12:05.437
Crashed on Sand Island.

1103
01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:06.724
Bullshit.

1104
01:12:06.732 --> 01:12:08.686
Hand to God. Saw it myself.

1105
01:12:08.691 --> 01:12:10.475
Mansfield, Nusbaum,

1106
01:12:10.482 --> 01:12:12.641
- focus on the job.
- Aye, sir.


1107
01:12:12.649 --> 01:12:14.353
- Sorry, skipper.
- We 're on course.


1108
01:12:14.357 --> 01:12:15.891
We have a fair amount
of mileage to eat up


1109
01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:17.262
before we course change.

1110
01:12:17.274 --> 01:12:18.558
Keep me posted.

1111
01:12:25.399 --> 01:12:27.479
Look, I'm sorry.

1112
01:12:27.482 --> 01:12:29.095
I'm still sorry.

1113
01:12:30.274 --> 01:12:32.604
Not your fault.

1114
01:12:32.607 --> 01:12:34.687
Well, certainly seems
like my fault.


1115
01:12:34.691 --> 01:12:36.054
We were the first plane back.

1116
01:12:36.065 --> 01:12:39.520
She's... bad luck, I guess.

1117
01:12:39.524 --> 01:12:41.762
We didn't have to be first back.

1118
01:12:41.773 --> 01:12:43.137
I could have checked it
in the morning,


1119
01:12:43.148 --> 01:12:44.603
but I was so eager
to get clearance.


1120
01:12:44.607 --> 01:12:47.061
That's all right, Caroll.

1121
01:12:47.065 --> 01:12:48.099
It's all right.

1122
01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:55.054
Apparently,
Pappy Cole found a TBD pilot


1123
01:12:55.065 --> 01:12:56.928
in the water yesterday, so...

1124
01:12:58.315 --> 01:13:00.304
I'm sure they're gonna be fine.

1125
01:13:01.773 --> 01:13:03.727
Yeah, I'm sure.

1126
01:13:05.065 --> 01:13:08.054
Still, it feels
like a bullshit order.


1127
01:13:08.065 --> 01:13:10.804
You mean the bullshit order
that has us following


1128
01:13:10.815 --> 01:13:12.974
a crippled Japanese fleet
back to Wake Island


1129
01:13:12.982 --> 01:13:15.221
with no intention or capability
of actually attacking it?


1130
01:13:16.482 --> 01:13:18.391
Yeah.

1131
01:13:18.399 --> 01:13:20.513
What, you don't think this is
a damn fine use of our time?


1132
01:13:20.524 --> 01:13:23.058
I mean, what if these damaged
battle-wagons leaking oil


1133
01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:25.270
and traveling at about 15 knots
in gentle waters,


1134
01:13:25.274 --> 01:13:27.604
somehow by the grace of God,
turned around,


1135
01:13:27.607 --> 01:13:29.095
made a run from Midway?

1136
01:13:32.773 --> 01:13:34.228
I'm sorry, skip.

1137
01:13:40.065 --> 01:13:41.644
You have control?

1138
01:13:44.648 --> 01:13:46.057
I have controls.

1139
01:13:55.773 --> 01:13:57.558
Just fly the damn plane.

1140
01:13:58.690 --> 01:14:00.020
Don't worry about it, man.

1141
01:14:54.357 --> 01:14:55.356
Please.

1142
01:14:57.148 --> 01:14:58.478
Please.

1143
01:16:17.148 --> 01:16:18.556
Skip, they see us now.

1144
01:16:18.565 --> 01:16:20.145
What, they raise a flag
or something?


1145
01:16:20.148 --> 01:16:21.886
No, watch. They're zigging.

1146
01:16:21.898 --> 01:16:24.103
I bet they think we're spotting
for a sub or something.


1147
01:16:24.107 --> 01:16:27.392
I wish. Nus, you think
they're changing destination?


1148
01:16:27.399 --> 01:16:30.138
No way, skipper. There's
nowhere else for them to go.


1149
01:16:30.148 --> 01:16:31.977
I wish they'd get to where
they're going in a hurry.


1150
01:16:31.982 --> 01:16:33.936
They are crawling.

1151
01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:36.350
Yeah, they got damaged ships
they're attending.


1152
01:16:36.357 --> 01:16:38.891
Fleet's only as fast
as the slowest ship, after all.


1153
01:16:38.898 --> 01:16:41.602
Well, get comfy, then,
because at this rate,


1154
01:16:41.606 --> 01:16:43.515
we've got a long flight
ahead of us.


1155
01:16:43.523 --> 01:16:44.887
You have controls?

1156
01:16:44.898 --> 01:16:47.103
I have controls.

1157
01:16:51.815 --> 01:16:53.929
I'm gonna get some shuteye.

1158
01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:54.939
Hey.

1159
01:16:56.065 --> 01:16:57.599
Sweet dreams, Sally.

1160
01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:47.099
Ah ha ha!

1161
01:17:51.606 --> 01:17:53.141
Fuck!

1162
01:17:53.148 --> 01:17:55.978
Fuck you, ocean!

1163
01:17:55.982 --> 01:17:58.221
Aah!

1164
01:18:31.439 --> 01:18:32.848
Pew.

1165
01:18:36.439 --> 01:18:37.438
Boom.

1166
01:18:39.439 --> 01:18:41.269
Pew.

1167
01:18:41.274 --> 01:18:42.273
Gotcha.

1168
01:18:55.107 --> 01:18:56.186
Pew.

1169
01:18:58.148 --> 01:18:59.852
Pulling back from the fleet.

1170
01:18:59.856 --> 01:19:01.220
Looks like they've picked up
a little steam


1171
01:19:01.232 --> 01:19:02.845
and patched up some damage.

1172
01:19:02.856 --> 01:19:04.560
They might even take
a pot shot at us.


1173
01:19:04.565 --> 01:19:07.929
Copy. They probably ran
their bunkers down to fumes.


1174
01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:10.020
I'll keep my distance.

1175
01:19:10.023 --> 01:19:11.682
Probably a good idea.

1176
01:19:15.148 --> 01:19:17.137
All hands, eyes on port side.

1177
01:19:17.148 --> 01:19:18.886
What do you see, Nus?

1178
01:19:20.023 --> 01:19:22.807
Ah, shit. Another one!

1179
01:19:22.815 --> 01:19:24.099
Starboard side.

1180
01:19:24.107 --> 01:19:25.936
Oh, hell.

1181
01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:27.678
We've wandered into range
of Wake's air strip!


1182
01:19:27.690 --> 01:19:29.770
Dinner's over, boys!

1183
01:19:29.773 --> 01:19:31.682
At least we got some
altitude this time.


1184
01:19:31.690 --> 01:19:33.394
Does give us
a couple more options.


1185
01:19:33.398 --> 01:19:34.933
I don't know what those options
are right now,


1186
01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:36.599
but we'll think of something.

1187
01:19:36.606 --> 01:19:39.095
A little weather right now
would be fantastic.


1188
01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:40.641
Good idea.

1189
01:19:40.648 --> 01:19:41.887
Let's find a squall.

1190
01:19:41.898 --> 01:19:44.012
Hang on, boys!

1191
01:19:47.648 --> 01:19:50.387
Keep him off our backs, Smokey!

1192
01:19:50.398 --> 01:19:52.012
I'm on it, skip.

1193
01:19:54.982 --> 01:19:58.812
Left, left, left,
coming through, coming through!


1194
01:19:58.815 --> 01:20:00.769
Here he comes. Climb low.

1195
01:20:00.773 --> 01:20:03.057
Watch it, though.
He '5 still behind us.


1196
01:20:03.065 --> 01:20:04.144
And where the hell are they?

1197
01:20:04.148 --> 01:20:05.352
I can't spot them!

1198
01:20:05.356 --> 01:20:07.220
Oh, going low, going low!

1199
01:20:14.023 --> 01:20:16.103
I'm going up high,
going up high!


1200
01:20:20.898 --> 01:20:22.557
Now where the hell are they?

1201
01:20:22.565 --> 01:20:24.054
A brace of them
on the west side!


1202
01:20:25.481 --> 01:20:27.765
- Where the hell are they?
- I can't spot them!


1203
01:20:27.773 --> 01:20:29.352
You got get eyes on them?

1204
01:20:31.232 --> 01:20:32.970
I think we lost them.

1205
01:20:32.982 --> 01:20:34.595
You're a damn jinx, Mansfield.

1206
01:20:34.606 --> 01:20:36.469
Shut your damn pie hole
and get back here!


1207
01:20:36.481 --> 01:20:38.186
Copy. Oh, here he comes again.

1208
01:20:38.190 --> 01:20:40.519
Six o'clock level.
Torch it, Smokey!


1209
01:20:42.231 --> 01:20:43.970
Get that son of a bitch!

1210
01:20:45.898 --> 01:20:48.352
Yeah, we took a piece off him!

1211
01:20:48.356 --> 01:20:50.016
Hopefully that'll slow him down.

1212
01:20:50.023 --> 01:20:51.022
Down.

1213
01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:53.480
Down.

1214
01:20:54.565 --> 01:20:56.224
Drop in the water
and play hole in the sea?


1215
01:20:56.231 --> 01:20:58.220
Getting awfully dark outside.

1216
01:20:58.231 --> 01:21:00.311
I'd rather hide than hope
he gets bored and goes home.


1217
01:21:00.314 --> 01:21:01.894
Agreed.

1218
01:23:01.398 --> 01:23:04.102
We've completed our turn
and are en route back to Pearl.


1219
01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:09.436
The galleys are serving
something special tonight


1220
01:23:09.439 --> 01:23:11.598
for the aviators
and the flight deck apes.


1221
01:23:11.606 --> 01:23:14.470
I'm sure they can save you some.

1222
01:23:14.481 --> 01:23:16.891
I've got a fondness
for Yankee pot roast.


1223
01:23:20.314 --> 01:23:22.519
Admiral Fletcher
will be taking command


1224
01:23:22.523 --> 01:23:24.978
of the Saratoga tomorrow
when she arrives


1225
01:23:24.982 --> 01:23:26.766
with replacement aircraft.

1226
01:23:26.773 --> 01:23:29.386
- Yes, I know.
- I saw the dispatch.


1227
01:23:30.731 --> 01:23:32.139
It's a tragedy

1228
01:23:32.147 --> 01:23:35.762
to lose a tough girl
like Yorktown.


1229
01:23:35.773 --> 01:23:37.978
I wish we would have had
the planes to help defend her.


1230
01:23:40.439 --> 01:23:43.894
We lost a lot of planes
sinking those carriers.


1231
01:23:43.898 --> 01:23:45.761
But we could've lost a lot more.

1232
01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:48.769
You were true to the men,

1233
01:23:48.773 --> 01:23:51.807
and they won't forget that
anytime soon.


1234
01:23:53.106 --> 01:23:55.311
I hope Fletcher
doesn't use them all up,


1235
01:23:55.314 --> 01:23:57.143
listening to overeager men
like Browning.


1236
01:23:58.982 --> 01:24:00.686
I certainly will drink
to that, Admiral.


1237
01:24:02.565 --> 01:24:05.269
Well, why don't you
get started on the toasts?


1238
01:24:05.273 --> 01:24:07.353
And I'll begin the reports.

1239
01:24:09.147 --> 01:24:10.602
See you, George.

1240
01:24:36.982 --> 01:24:37.981
Lee.

1241
01:24:39.898 --> 01:24:41.511
I'm thirsty, Lee.

1242
01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:02.224
This albatross around my neck.

1243
01:25:09.314 --> 01:25:10.393
Water.

1244
01:25:12.648 --> 01:25:14.136
I have no water.

1245
01:25:31.523 --> 01:25:32.932
But I won't die.

1246
01:25:34.939 --> 01:25:36.394
I won't die.

1247
01:25:49.773 --> 01:25:51.727
But I'm not your puppet.

1248
01:25:55.064 --> 01:25:56.394
You hear me, God?

1249
01:25:59.481 --> 01:26:01.310
I'm not your Job.

1250
01:26:04.690 --> 01:26:06.928
And I can't suffer anymore.

1251
01:26:10.565 --> 01:26:12.554
I'm not gonna suffer.

1252
01:27:16.897 --> 01:27:18.352
Hey.

1253
01:27:18.356 --> 01:27:20.720
Hey, welcome aboard, Doc.

1254
01:27:20.731 --> 01:27:22.094
Yeah, welcome aboard.

1255
01:27:22.106 --> 01:27:23.641
All we have is Mansfield there.

1256
01:27:23.648 --> 01:27:24.977
He's only got two techniques
for medicine...


1257
01:27:24.981 --> 01:27:27.220
Aspirin and stitches.

1258
01:27:27.231 --> 01:27:29.185
I'll try and teach him
something.


1259
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:31.553
- Good luck.
- All right, boys. Listen up.


1260
01:27:31.565 --> 01:27:33.144
There's at least a hundred men
out there


1261
01:27:33.147 --> 01:27:34.386
from the Enterprise alone,

1262
01:27:34.398 --> 01:27:35.728
waiting to get picked up.

1263
01:27:35.731 --> 01:27:38.140
We've got supplies, so let's go.

1264
01:27:38.147 --> 01:27:40.010
We never did go look
for that poor SOB


1265
01:27:40.022 --> 01:27:41.431
we dropped a boat to.

1266
01:27:41.439 --> 01:27:43.018
- Oh, yeah.
- No, they picked him up.


1267
01:27:43.022 --> 01:27:45.102
Hand to God, a destroyer
picked him up yesterday.


1268
01:27:45.106 --> 01:27:46.470
Nearly ran him over.

1269
01:27:46.481 --> 01:27:48.890
Marine aviator. Go figure.

1270
01:27:48.897 --> 01:27:50.261
Well, we're gonna keep
on looking.


1271
01:27:50.273 --> 01:27:51.728
I'm all for looking, but, uh,

1272
01:27:51.731 --> 01:27:53.810
how long can someone
on the water last?


1273
01:27:53.814 --> 01:27:55.848
Doesn't matter. We've been
nearly shot down twice


1274
01:27:55.855 --> 01:27:57.310
since the Japs came to town,

1275
01:27:57.314 --> 01:27:58.678
and I sure as shit would want

1276
01:27:58.690 --> 01:28:00.144
somebody out there
looking for us.


1277
01:28:00.147 --> 01:28:02.431
We've got orders
to search and rescue,


1278
01:28:02.439 --> 01:28:05.519
so we're searching
and we're rescuing.


1279
01:28:05.523 --> 01:28:07.512
And when we run out of fuel,
we'll come back here,


1280
01:28:07.523 --> 01:28:10.886
we'll get some more,
and we'll do it again.


1281
01:28:10.897 --> 01:28:13.511
Our brother's been out there
long enough.


1282
01:28:13.523 --> 01:28:15.011
It's time to bring him home.

1283
01:28:29.606 --> 01:28:33.181
- I don't know, uh...
- I don't know.


1284
01:28:36.481 --> 01:28:38.140
Norman Francis Vandivier.

1285
01:28:38.147 --> 01:28:39.727
Didn't you promise
never to walk through that door?


1286
01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:41.219
We had plans to do our time

1287
01:28:41.231 --> 01:28:44.890
and then fly beautiful,
rich women around the globe.


1288
01:28:44.897 --> 01:28:48.182
10,000 a year to start.

1289
01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:49.893
It's three times more
than what we get paid


1290
01:28:49.897 --> 01:28:51.306
flying for Uncle Sam.

1291
01:28:51.314 --> 01:28:52.768
I still got four years in,
though.


1292
01:28:54.481 --> 01:28:57.185
In those four years,
we will log enough hours


1293
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:59.018
to get a job like that.

1294
01:28:59.022 --> 01:29:00.511
They're gonna want to hire us?

1295
01:29:00.523 --> 01:29:02.136
Pan Am is huge.

1296
01:29:02.147 --> 01:29:05.307
They're opening up routes
to China and Australia,


1297
01:29:05.314 --> 01:29:07.348
all right?
They're hiring tons of pilots.


1298
01:29:07.356 --> 01:29:08.764
They're dying for us.

1299
01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:13.473
- I don't know.
- Uh, four years is a long time.


1300
01:29:13.481 --> 01:29:16.094
- Mm-hmm.
- I was kind of thinking about


1301
01:29:16.106 --> 01:29:18.845
settling down here in Hawaii
when I get out.


1302
01:29:18.855 --> 01:29:20.640
Are you still seeing
that, uh, that hot number?


1303
01:29:20.648 --> 01:29:22.102
What's her name, um, Ellie?

1304
01:29:24.356 --> 01:29:26.844
So it's getting serious?

1305
01:29:26.855 --> 01:29:29.344
I think she's a good fit.

1306
01:29:29.356 --> 01:29:31.265
It's perfect.

1307
01:29:31.273 --> 01:29:33.011
Free vacations for her.

1308
01:29:33.022 --> 01:29:35.261
- Less competition for me.
- It's a win-win.


1309
01:29:37.273 --> 01:29:39.182
I'll give you a maybe.

1310
01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:40.893
Like I said before,
that's perfect.


1311
01:29:40.897 --> 01:29:43.806
A maybe is three Mai Tais
away from a yes.


1312
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:57.303
It's a parable of sorts.

1313
01:30:05.523 --> 01:30:06.931
Hey, Lee.

1314
01:30:09.897 --> 01:30:11.726
Poor bastard.

1315
01:30:11.730 --> 01:30:14.685
Suffers and suffers.

1316
01:30:16.981 --> 01:30:19.311
And in the end, because...

1317
01:30:19.314 --> 01:30:23.261
of his suffering, he is redeemed

1318
01:30:23.273 --> 01:30:25.512
and restored by God's mercy.

1319
01:30:30.606 --> 01:30:33.969
You know, you only mentioned
one poor bastard.


1320
01:30:33.981 --> 01:30:34.980
Not two.

1321
01:30:37.565 --> 01:30:40.395
I only... I only meant about us.

1322
01:30:40.398 --> 01:30:41.852
I know what you meant.

1323
01:30:44.523 --> 01:30:46.102
I'm sorry, Lee.

1324
01:30:49.231 --> 01:30:50.595
It's okay.

1325
01:30:53.106 --> 01:30:55.060
See you on the other side,
Norman.


1326
01:30:57.273 --> 01:30:59.057
See you on the other side, Lee.

1327
01:31:18.939 --> 01:31:20.178
Jim.

1328
01:31:24.314 --> 01:31:26.018
Jim, I'm here.

1329
01:31:30.981 --> 01:31:32.186
I'm here.

1330
01:31:33.689 --> 01:31:34.688
Hey.

1331
01:31:40.273 --> 01:31:41.272
Hey.

1332
01:31:42.398 --> 01:31:43.806
All right. Setting her down.

1333
01:31:43.814 --> 01:31:46.894
Easy. Easy.

1334
01:31:59.981 --> 01:32:00.980
Huh?

1335
01:32:08.647 --> 01:32:11.057
Hey, Doc, you're on.

1336
01:32:11.064 --> 01:32:13.768
Smokey,
you feel like taking a swim?


1337
01:32:13.772 --> 01:32:15.761
Machine gun champion
and Olympic class swimmer,


1338
01:32:15.772 --> 01:32:17.511
you know me.

1339
01:32:17.523 --> 01:32:19.477
I got control.

1340
01:32:19.481 --> 01:32:20.639
Hey Skip.

1341
01:32:20.647 --> 01:32:22.056
Go get him.

1342
01:32:25.814 --> 01:32:27.894
Let's go, boys!

1343
01:32:36.772 --> 01:32:38.102
You got him.

1344
01:32:38.106 --> 01:32:39.810
- Come on, Louie.
- Be careful, man.


1345
01:32:39.814 --> 01:32:40.813
You got him.

1346
01:32:43.689 --> 01:32:46.099
Norman Francis Vandivier,

1347
01:32:46.106 --> 01:32:47.719
I thought I left you
back at Pearl,


1348
01:32:47.730 --> 01:32:49.514
black-out drunk under a table.

1349
01:32:49.522 --> 01:32:52.262
You still owe me,
like, 10 drinks!


1350
01:32:52.273 --> 01:32:55.978
I have an IOU
that says otherwise.


1351
01:32:55.981 --> 01:32:58.470
Less talking, more swimming.

1352
01:33:07.897 --> 01:33:09.476
Come on, come on, let's go.

1353
01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:11.199
- We got you. We got you.
- Come on, Smokey.


1354
01:33:36.814 --> 01:33:39.303
- Hey, you're in shock.
- You're in good hands now.


1355
01:33:42.897 --> 01:33:45.432
Thank you. Thank you.

1356
01:33:51.981 --> 01:33:55.015
Yeah. Welcome aboard.

1357
01:33:55.022 --> 01:33:57.476
We're gonna take you home.
