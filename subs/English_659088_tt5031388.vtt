And you owe it us.

303
00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:24.695
You owe it to us to pay this debt
you've incurred with your betrayal.


304
00:19:24.697 --> 00:19:26.430
With stabbing us in the back.

you broke that trust.

shoot and some people you can't.

And I've been real
patient up till now.

spin on the bad side?

Management is quite pleased
with me. I can assure you.

No, not everyone's a fan.

342

They need me.

343

Long as they do,
I'm untouchable.

- Yes.

won't be back eventually, but...


767
00:50:45.058 --> 00:50:45.786
No, no.

768
00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:47.776
Wait, wait, wait a second.

769
00:50:49.013 --> 00:50:51.413
What-what did you say to him?

770
00:50:52.617 --> 00:50:57.386
Look, from what you told me, that guy has
some serious self-esteem issues, okay?


771
00:50:57.388 --> 00:50:59.989
Especially when it comes to being
manly in some macho bullshit kinda way,


772
00:50:59.991 --> 00:51:02.792
so I just preyed on that.

773
00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:04.700
He's got a lot to think about
now, and hopefully


774
00:51:04.712 --> 00:51:06.513
that'll keep him outta
your hair for a while.


775

[SIGHS]

776
00:51:09.016 --> 00:51:11.267
- Well, thank you, I guess.
- You're welcome.


777
00:51:11.269 --> 00:51:14.470
And seriously, I'm sorry about the
inquisition before, but I needed the ammo.


778
00:51:14.872 --> 00:51:16.872
Handsome, uh, funny.

779
00:51:17.775 --> 00:51:21.010
Now I find out that you've got
all these people skills, wow.


780
00:51:22.313 --> 00:51:24.947
Tell you, for some
random guy off the street,


781
00:51:24.949 --> 00:51:27.283
you are certainly proving
to be very intriguing.


782
00:51:28.519 --> 00:51:29.551
Well, that's me.

783
00:51:30.288 --> 00:51:31.387
Man of mystery.

784
00:51:32.056 --> 00:51:34.490
So, what're you a psychiatrist?

785
00:51:34.492 --> 00:51:37.893
Don't you need a, uh, pipe and
a sweater vest for that? Right?


786
00:51:37.895 --> 00:51:39.495
[CHUCKLING] See, that's funny.

787
00:51:41.532 --> 00:51:43.532
Okay, come on, what do you do?

788
00:51:45.603 --> 00:51:47.836
- I'll tell you when I...
- When you get to know me better.


789
00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:51.058
You don't get to play that card
now, because


790
00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:53.942
I just told you some
really disgusting,


791
00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:58.881
personal stuff about me and that
ass-lover that just crawled out of here.


792
00:51:58.883 --> 00:52:04.620
So, unless clothes are coming off,
uh, I think we kinda plateaued


793
00:52:04.622 --> 00:52:08.390
on the whole getting to know one
another better front, wouldn't you say?


794
00:52:12.863 --> 00:52:14.563
I eliminate people.

795
00:52:16.767 --> 00:52:19.535
- You what?
- I eliminate people.


796
00:52:21.839 --> 00:52:24.073
Like kill, people?

797
00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:27.042
Murder?

798
00:52:27.044 --> 00:52:29.722
Oh, you're not seriously
sitting here and


799
00:52:29.734 --> 00:52:32.681
telling me that you're
some kind of psycho...


800
00:52:32.683 --> 00:52:34.483
- No, no.
- Serial killer?


801
00:52:34.485 --> 00:52:35.818
No. No, no, no.

802
00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:38.053
Psychopaths kill for recreation.

803
00:52:38.055 --> 00:52:40.589
<i>Like for fun. That's
crazy, that's sick.</i>


804
00:52:40.591 --> 00:52:42.057
Uh, yeah.

805
00:52:42.059 --> 00:52:43.625
No, I do it for work.

806
00:52:45.863 --> 00:52:47.029
Oh, like a hit man?

807
00:52:47.832 --> 00:52:49.598
Yeah, like that.

808
00:52:51.402 --> 00:52:53.902
- For real?
- Yeah, for real.


809
00:52:54.472 --> 00:53:00.909
And what do you, like, shoot 'em,
or stab 'em, or poison 'em, blow 'em up?


810
00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:03.112
<i>No. Nothing so... no,
that's not what I do.</i>


811
00:53:04.815 --> 00:53:07.483
I'm more specialized.

812
00:53:08.419 --> 00:53:09.419
What does that mean?

813
00:53:10.588 --> 00:53:11.588
Okay.

814
00:53:12.456 --> 00:53:14.156
Let's take your ex, Stu.

815
00:53:14.158 --> 00:53:16.558
Let's say you wanted
to kill him, okay?


816
00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:19.862
<i>Oh, okay. Yeah, or yeah, sure
let's, uh, yeah, why don't we...</i>


817
00:53:19.864 --> 00:53:21.130
- Right.
- Why don't we say that?


818
00:53:21.132 --> 00:53:23.132
- So, you shoot him. Or stab him.
- Ooh.


819
00:53:23.134 --> 00:53:25.534
Whatever. It's murder.

820
00:53:25.535 --> 00:53:28.015
<i>And the cops know it's murder.
Who do they immediately suspect?</i>


821
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.740
- Okay.
- Even if you have an air-tight alibi,


822
00:53:31.742 --> 00:53:33.041
they're gonna be
all up in your grill.


823
00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:36.478
Poking holes, looking for
weakness in the seams.


824
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.448
And if they look hard enough,
eventually they're gonna find something.


825
00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:41.850
See because when it's
murder? Clearly murder.


826
00:53:41.852 --> 00:53:44.553
Everyone is looking for the killer,
and usually who that person is, well,


827
00:53:44.555 --> 00:53:46.305
it's pretty obvious.

828
00:53:46.306 --> 00:53:48.056
<i>Okay, so you... you make
it look like an accident.</i>


829
00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:50.025
- No. No, no, no that's...
- No.


830
00:53:50.027 --> 00:53:51.827
Too risky.

831
00:53:51.828 --> 00:53:53.628
It's tough to spin all the
physical evidence right.


832
00:53:53.631 --> 00:53:56.498
Look, you can't have anyone
suspect any foul play.


833
00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:57.500
Hmm.

834
00:53:58.102 --> 00:54:03.071
So, what do you do? I just...

835
00:54:03.908 --> 00:54:06.909
Okay, in movies, in the
spaceship, in the villain's lair,


836
00:54:06.911 --> 00:54:09.578
there's always -this auto
self-destruct switch, right?


837
00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:12.548
<i>Uh-huh. Yeah.
I... I mean, I guess, yeah.</i>


838
00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:14.183
Okay. People have those.

839
00:54:14.752 --> 00:54:17.986
Every single person
has a self-destruct switch.


840
00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:22.958
A button, that if you press it hard
enough, they'll do all the work themselves.


841
00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:24.660
All you got to do is find it.

842
00:54:25.095 --> 00:54:29.097
- And they'll kill themselves?
- Sometimes.


843
00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:31.500
Sometimes they'll just
do something reckless.


844
00:54:31.502 --> 00:54:33.569
Drive drunk, overdose, you know.

845
00:54:33.571 --> 00:54:35.771
Kill someone else
in a fit of passion.


846
00:54:35.773 --> 00:54:39.041
And then, when they realize what they've
done, they'll turn the gun on themselves,


847
00:54:39.043 --> 00:54:42.144
<i>or end up in jail, or psycho out.
Whatever, it doesn't matter,</i>


848
00:54:42.146 --> 00:54:44.613
as long as they self-destruct
themselves outta the picture.


849
00:54:45.583 --> 00:54:48.784
[SIGHS] Jesus Christ.

850
00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:50.953
Well, you asked.

851
00:54:52.056 --> 00:54:53.222
So how do you do it?

852
00:54:53.224 --> 00:54:59.695
<i>I mean how do you determine wh... what
somebody's self-destruct switch is?</i>


853
00:54:59.697 --> 00:55:03.198
- What's gonna make them snap?
- It's really not that hard.


854
00:55:05.102 --> 00:55:06.902
All it takes is a
little research.


855
00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:09.071
A little intuition.

856
00:55:09.073 --> 00:55:14.510
You got to find that one thing that
someone loves above everything else.


857
00:55:15.012 --> 00:55:17.513
That one thing
that we hang onto.


858
00:55:17.515 --> 00:55:21.583
That thing that makes all the awful
stuff we have to do and endure in life


859
00:55:21.585 --> 00:55:22.851
worth the effort.

860
00:55:22.853 --> 00:55:26.244
You find what it is,
you insert yourself into


861
00:55:26.256 --> 00:55:29.658
their life,
and you take that something away.


862
00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:32.961
And just like dominos,
everything else just falls.


863
00:55:34.198 --> 00:55:37.065
It's a pretty particular
approach.


864
00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:38.834
Can't trace it
back to the client.


865
00:55:38.836 --> 00:55:40.135
No one knows who hired you.

866
00:55:41.105 --> 00:55:43.472
But it's risky.

867
00:55:43.473 --> 00:55:45.840
Because if you get close enough to someone
to push their self-destruct button?


868
00:55:45.843 --> 00:55:46.308
Ooh!

869
00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:50.012
[GUY] You run the risk of getting
caught in the explosion yourself.


870
00:55:52.182 --> 00:55:53.282
Can I help you?

871
00:55:55.953 --> 00:55:56.953
No.

872
00:55:58.756 --> 00:56:02.571
And everyone has one of
these self-destruct switches?


873
00:56:02.583 --> 00:56:03.859
Everyone.

874
00:56:03.861 --> 00:56:05.694
You just got to
know them a little.


875
00:56:06.263 --> 00:56:07.263
Okay.

876
00:56:08.299 --> 00:56:09.631
So, what's mine?

877
00:56:10.868 --> 00:56:11.934
I don't know.

878
00:56:11.936 --> 00:56:13.001
You do.

879
00:56:13.003 --> 00:56:14.820
Seriously, I don't.

880
00:56:14.821 --> 00:56:16.638
- I barely know you.
- That is such bullshit.


881
00:56:17.007 --> 00:56:21.977
You just got Stu packing outta here,
and you barely had anything on him.


882
00:56:21.979 --> 00:56:22.979
Wait a minute.

883
00:56:24.315 --> 00:56:26.214
- Is Stu gonna kill himself?
- No.


884
00:56:27.051 --> 00:56:28.717
No, no. I mean I doubt it.

885
00:56:28.719 --> 00:56:29.851
I barely spoke to him.

886
00:56:29.853 --> 00:56:32.020
Oh, okay. Okay.

887
00:56:33.023 --> 00:56:36.625
But clearly you were able to
determine what his switch was, right?


888
00:56:36.994 --> 00:56:37.994
So,

889
00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:39.928
what's mine?

890
00:56:42.766 --> 00:56:43.966
I don't think you wanna know.

891
00:56:43.968 --> 00:56:46.835
<i>Are you kidding me?
Of course I wanna know.</i>


892
00:56:46.837 --> 00:56:51.273
<i>I mean, what if... what if Stu hires
some guy like you to come after me?</i>


893
00:56:51.275 --> 00:56:56.378
If I know what my switch is,
then I can protect myself, right?


894
00:56:58.282 --> 00:56:59.848
Come on.

895
00:57:01.919 --> 00:57:02.919
Come on.

896
00:57:10.728 --> 00:57:11.728
Okay.

897
00:57:12.696 --> 00:57:13.696
Okay.

898
00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:19.267
I think your switch
has to do with time.


899
00:57:20.938 --> 00:57:22.871
- With time?
- Time.


900
00:57:23.974 --> 00:57:25.240
You are a beautiful woman.

901
00:57:26.043 --> 00:57:27.909
Oh. Thank you.

902
00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:28.911
You're smart.

903
00:57:29.213 --> 00:57:30.646
Too smart for this job.

904
00:57:30.948 --> 00:57:32.948
- Yeah.
- You're funny.


905
00:57:33.751 --> 00:57:36.118
<i>You're clever.
Obviously well-educated.</i>


906
00:57:36.887 --> 00:57:39.855
You started your adult life
with a wealth of possibilities.


907
00:57:41.392 --> 00:57:43.692
But now some time has passed.

908
00:57:43.694 --> 00:57:44.860
A lot of time.

909
00:57:44.862 --> 00:57:50.065
And those opportunities that you'd hoped
for either weren't taken advantage of


910
00:57:50.067 --> 00:57:52.000
or just didn't
present themselves.


911
00:57:53.003 --> 00:57:54.369
So, you're stuck here.

912
00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:56.305
Broke.

913
00:57:56.807 --> 00:57:58.740
Working at a crappy diner.

914
00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:01.677
Your beauty is fading.

915
00:58:01.679 --> 00:58:04.821
Time is passing you by,
and there's not a lot


916
00:58:04.833 --> 00:58:07.849
of it left for you to
become something more


917
00:58:07.851 --> 00:58:09.017
than you already are.

918
00:58:10.387 --> 00:58:12.320
So, you dream of better things.

919
00:58:13.824 --> 00:58:18.226
Read romance novels, flirt with guys
