00:02:20.078 --> 00:02:22.410
-You wanna get somethin' to eat?
-Nah.


2
00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:24.642
I had somethin' last night,
ruined my appetite.


3
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.650
Besides, I gotta get down the road.

4
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.187
Okay. Thanks for the ride.

5
00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.427
Come on, I'll buy you
a cup of tea and a bromo.


6
00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:44.830
-Come on.
-Okay, but I can only stay a minute.


7
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.660
Good.

8
00:02:56.882 --> 00:02:59.976
Okay, we open. Come in.

9
00:03:00.486 --> 00:03:02.920
-Where's the john at?
-In the back.


10
00:03:04.723 --> 00:03:06.657
Gimme a bromo for my friend here.

11
00:03:06.725 --> 00:03:08.750
I'll take a small steak,
two eggs on top...


12
00:03:08.827 --> 00:03:11.227
...some fries, juice,
and a side order of toast....


13
00:03:11.263 --> 00:03:14.061
Yes, sure. Right away.

14
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:19.061
Look out for that stomach, huh?

15
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.728
Here we fix you up one second.
You'll feel much better.


16
00:03:59.511 --> 00:04:01.502
Okay. See you, huh?

17
00:04:12.124 --> 00:04:14.354
We'll have your steak
ready in a minute.


18
00:04:23.302 --> 00:04:25.395
Where's my buddy?

19
00:04:25.537 --> 00:04:26.663
Oh, he left.

20
00:04:26.738 --> 00:04:28.000
He left?

21
00:04:28.073 --> 00:04:31.099
-What are you talkin' about?
-Hey, what's a matter? You okay?


22
00:04:38.417 --> 00:04:41.716
The guy drove off on me.
How are you gonna figure that?


23
00:04:43.922 --> 00:04:46.789
Oh, I think your steak's ready.

24
00:04:52.864 --> 00:04:54.832
Thank you.

25
00:05:11.216 --> 00:05:12.615
Oh, no!

26
00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.153
-What?
-He took my wallet.


27
00:05:16.388 --> 00:05:18.948
I left the raincoat in the car and....

28
00:05:19.558 --> 00:05:21.287
I can't even pay you for this.

29
00:05:28.834 --> 00:05:31.268
Tell me, where you goin' anyway?

30
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.935
-Down to L.A.
-Why?


31
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.939
I was goin' down for a job.
The whole thing's in the wallet.


32
00:05:38.477 --> 00:05:41.173
-What kind of job?
-Phone number...huh?


33
00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:42.906
Machinist.

34
00:05:51.123 --> 00:05:52.090
Eat.

35
00:05:52.157 --> 00:05:54.887
-Hey, thanks a lot.
-Eat, you'll feel better.


36
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.328
I'll be right back.

37
00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.157
You watch.

38
00:06:02.267 --> 00:06:04.167
-Watch what?
-You watch.


39
00:06:04.202 --> 00:06:06.329
I find a new guy for the cars.

40
00:06:11.109 --> 00:06:12.906
How's food? Good?

41
00:06:13.111 --> 00:06:15.102
Very good. Great. Really.

42
00:06:16.682 --> 00:06:19.742
-Nick Papadakis.
-Frank Chambers.


43
00:06:20.018 --> 00:06:21.576
Frank, huh?

44
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.617
You know cars, Frank?

45
00:06:24.022 --> 00:06:25.353
Yeah. Some.

46
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:27.884
I need mechanic.

47
00:06:28.794 --> 00:06:30.728
-Here?
-Oh, sure. Station.


48
00:06:33.298 --> 00:06:35.926
I'll tell you, though, Nick...

49
00:06:36.301 --> 00:06:38.769
...l got friends down in L.A.

50
00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:42.905
I gotta go down in L.A. Thanks.

51
00:06:43.208 --> 00:06:45.403
And the meal, really, it was delicious.

52
00:06:45.477 --> 00:06:46.842
She cook the food.

53
00:06:52.517 --> 00:06:53.916
The food...

54
00:06:55.954 --> 00:06:57.546
...delicious.

55
00:07:14.606 --> 00:07:17.598
Tell me somethin', Nick,
just a question....


56
00:07:18.643 --> 00:07:20.736
What would you pay a guy?

57
00:07:22.214 --> 00:07:25.445
-Cora, how much we pay last guy?
-Eight dollars.


58
00:07:25.984 --> 00:07:27.975
-And you promised him....
-Eight dollars.


59
00:07:28.053 --> 00:07:30.419
Room, board and you say
you like my wife's cooking.


60
00:07:32.858 --> 00:07:35.520
-Your wife?
-Oh, sure.


61
00:07:42.167 --> 00:07:45.432
Tell you what, Nick.
I got to track my guy down in L.A.


62
00:07:46.238 --> 00:07:49.332
If it don't pan out,
I take you up on it.


63
00:07:50.442 --> 00:07:53.070
Well, okay. If we still got it.

64
00:07:57.749 --> 00:08:01.048
And I'll send you some money
in any case for the breakfast.


65
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.912
-Oh, yeah. Do that.
-Okay. Thanks a lot, Nick.


66
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:10.523
Goodbye, now.

67
00:08:12.197 --> 00:08:12.925
Missus.

68
00:08:50.068 --> 00:08:52.036
Be right with you there.

69
00:08:56.241 --> 00:08:59.142
Here's a change, 20 cents.
Thank you very much.


70
00:09:00.078 --> 00:09:02.478
What you need, Mr. Papadakis,
is more coverage.


71
00:09:02.547 --> 00:09:04.412
I hadda lass year.

72
00:09:04.482 --> 00:09:06.347
Last year you had fire,
theft, no liability.


73
00:09:06.418 --> 00:09:07.612
So what I need it now for?

74
00:09:07.686 --> 00:09:09.779
Well, you should've had it then.

75
00:09:09.855 --> 00:09:12.824
Suppose a customer comes in here and
there's a spot of grease on the floor?


76
00:09:13.225 --> 00:09:14.886
No, I'm sorry.
There's no grease onna floor.


77
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.293
-No, I'm just sayin' suppose.
-No. You suppose-a something else.


78
00:09:29.207 --> 00:09:32.472
-What are you doing here?
-I come lookin' for some hand soap.


79
00:09:33.044 --> 00:09:35.604
I don't have any hand soap here.

80
00:09:36.381 --> 00:09:38.713
You got anything in the kitchen
I could use?


81
00:09:38.884 --> 00:09:40.875
Go use the station john.

82
00:09:42.187 --> 00:09:44.155
I'd just get it dirty.

83
00:09:49.728 --> 00:09:52.959
I'll tell him to get you some
the next time he goes in.


84
00:09:54.432 --> 00:09:56.400
Sorry to bother you.

85
00:10:04.643 --> 00:10:06.804
You want a cup of coffee?

86
00:10:08.647 --> 00:10:10.478
Yeah, thanks.

87
00:10:12.217 --> 00:10:14.651
A nice place you got here,
Mrs. Papadukis.


88
00:10:16.388 --> 00:10:17.855
Papadakis.

89
00:10:18.924 --> 00:10:21.017
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

90
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.859
Papadakis.

91
00:10:26.564 --> 00:10:29.089
What are you, Greek or somethin'?

92
00:10:30.702 --> 00:10:32.397
What...do I look Greek to you?

93
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.172
No.

94
00:10:43.048 --> 00:10:44.276
Thanks.

95
00:10:46.718 --> 00:10:48.379
So...

96
00:10:50.221 --> 00:10:52.052
...what do I call ya?

97
00:10:56.194 --> 00:10:58.219
I guess you can call me Cora.

98
00:11:01.333 --> 00:11:04.359
A man, every man,
needs to have a home.


99
00:11:11.409 --> 00:11:14.139
-You travel, huh?
-Sure.


100
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.011
It's okay.

101
00:11:17.415 --> 00:11:19.645
But you know, the time come....

102
00:11:20.618 --> 00:11:22.609
The time come!

103
00:11:26.124 --> 00:11:28.354
Close the door, it is windy.

104
00:11:31.129 --> 00:11:33.962
Cora, give the man some wine.

105
00:11:35.066 --> 00:11:38.399
-It's in the cupboard if he wants it.
-Nice coffee, Missus.


106
00:11:39.504 --> 00:11:41.404
When the times comes....

107
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.903
I used to travel a lot, too.

108
00:11:44.642 --> 00:11:46.473
I was a young idiot.

109
00:11:46.711 --> 00:11:48.542
I know you...sit down.

110
00:11:50.448 --> 00:11:52.507
I know you travelin' men.

111
00:11:53.251 --> 00:11:54.513
I was, too.

112
00:11:54.919 --> 00:11:58.252
Oh, sure. I've been everyplace.
I speak six language.


113
00:11:58.857 --> 00:12:01.690
-No kiddin'.
-Oh, yes, sure.


114
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:05.686
Go get the wine, huh?

115
00:12:06.765 --> 00:12:09.461
Ah, language. Watch this.

116
00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:19.066
You know what that is?

117
00:12:19.744 --> 00:12:20.870
What?

118
00:12:24.783 --> 00:12:26.751
You know what it means, that?

119
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.382
No.

120
00:12:32.424 --> 00:12:36.861
I know, you never make fun
of a man talk funny.


121
00:12:36.928 --> 00:12:39.897
I talk English
better than she talk Greek.


122
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.730
You know, Frank, this-a country...

123
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.404
...there's no...

124
00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.638
...there's no...ideas here.

125
00:12:53.945 --> 00:12:56.470
Opportunity, oh yes.

126
00:13:03.888 --> 00:13:05.753
There is no happiness.

127
00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.323
Frank, Frank come here!
Hurry up! Quick!


128
00:14:15.827 --> 00:14:17.818
Hurry up! Look!
Look at his!


129
00:14:24.302 --> 00:14:26.270
Goddamn son of a bitch thief.

130
00:14:27.005 --> 00:14:29.599
Here, pick 'em up. Here.

131
00:14:31.609 --> 00:14:33.668
-Hold on. You got 'em?
-Where are we goin'?


132
00:14:33.745 --> 00:14:35.838
We go here. Put 'em up on post.

133
00:14:36.314 --> 00:14:37.804
You got it?

134
00:14:40.752 --> 00:14:43.220
Push. Push.

135
00:14:50.862 --> 00:14:52.261
Know what I'd do, Nick?

136
00:14:53.665 --> 00:14:56.031
-I'd get a new one.
-Oh, I get new one, sure.


137
00:14:56.634 --> 00:14:58.932
And that son of a bitch
hang it first time, he pay for it.


138
00:14:59.003 --> 00:15:01.972
Neon. Somethin' flashy.
You know what I mean?


139
00:15:02.006 --> 00:15:03.405
Bring some business in.

140
00:15:03.474 --> 00:15:05.066
Neon? What's a neon?

141
00:15:06.644 --> 00:15:08.544
Neon. You know...

142
00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.813
-...them little colored tubes.
-Tubes.


143
00:15:13.718 --> 00:15:15.379
Oh, it's a neon.

144
00:15:15.954 --> 00:15:17.922
Yeah, neon....

145
00:15:20.892 --> 00:15:22.154
Maybe.

146
00:15:23.728 --> 00:15:25.923
Goddamn, they all try cheat foreigner.

147
00:15:32.737 --> 00:15:34.762
Frank, clean up the place.

148
00:15:52.123 --> 00:15:54.523
He say how long he's gonna be gone?

149
00:15:55.093 --> 00:15:56.788
He didn't tell me.

150
00:15:56.861 --> 00:16:00.058
He said he was goin' into town
to get some parts.


151
00:16:04.168 --> 00:16:07.296
Smells good in here today.

152
00:16:12.644 --> 00:16:14.578
Is that door locked?

153
00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.380
I must've locked it.

154
00:16:30.695 --> 00:16:33.220
That's money down the drain,
isn't it?


155
00:16:33.698 --> 00:16:36.792
You could look at it that way,
if you wanted to, yeah.


156
00:16:40.672 --> 00:16:42.731
It's not your money, either, is it?

157
00:16:43.941 --> 00:16:44.930
No.

158
00:17:01.159 --> 00:17:02.490
Open it.

159
00:17:08.533 --> 00:17:10.501
Did you hear me?

160
00:18:16.801 --> 00:18:18.325
Wait a minute!

161
00:18:19.237 --> 00:18:21.330
Wait! Get off!

162
00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.581
All right, come on!

163
00:18:40.258 --> 00:18:41.589
Come on!

164
00:21:22.119 --> 00:21:24.087
I have surprise for you.

165
00:21:25.823 --> 00:21:27.586
Here.

166
00:21:30.261 --> 00:21:33.822
What do you think, huh? It's new.

167
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.858
Let's see it.

168
00:21:42.306 --> 00:21:46.106
-You like it?
-Nick, it's beautiful. Real silk?


169
00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:49.646
-Yeah, silk.
-For you, huh?


170
00:21:50.915 --> 00:21:54.715
-Where you go?
-I'll be right back.


171
00:22:45.903 --> 00:22:48.463
How'd you get that way?

172
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.204
How're you feelin' tonight, Cora?

173
00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:54.004
Lousy.

174
00:22:54.412 --> 00:22:55.470
Yeah.

175
00:23:08.426 --> 00:23:10.690
Yeah, you missed me.

176
00:23:12.096 --> 00:23:14.257
Cora!

177
00:24:00.211 --> 00:24:02.372
Oh, stupid, I almost forgot.

178
00:24:05.015 --> 00:24:08.246
Like the sign, huh?
I see they make it the way I say.


179
00:24:11.055 --> 00:24:12.522
See you tomorrow, eh?

180
00:24:16.527 --> 00:24:18.552
Yeah, see you later, Nick.

181
00:24:38.315 --> 00:24:39.282
Yeah?

182
00:24:52.797 --> 00:24:54.765
Feel like doin' somethin'?

183
00:24:57.168 --> 00:24:58.533
I'm doin' it.

184
00:25:13.684 --> 00:25:16.084
Do you want some company?

185
00:25:30.968 --> 00:25:33.232
Huh? Want some company?

186
00:25:43.047 --> 00:25:44.810
You want to be with me, right?

187
00:25:47.051 --> 00:25:48.143
Right?

188
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.646
Yeah.

189
00:25:52.656 --> 00:25:53.782
Good.

190
00:25:55.526 --> 00:25:57.721
Go pack a bag, we're goin' to Chicago.

191
00:26:07.705 --> 00:26:09.832
Go pack a bag.

192
00:26:09.907 --> 00:26:12.034
We're goin' to Chicago. Now.

193
00:26:27.424 --> 00:26:30.916
-I used to work near here.
-Get your L.A. Times.


194
00:26:32.696 --> 00:26:35.665
-You got a cigarette?
-No.


195
00:26:38.469 --> 00:26:40.232
How much money you got?

196
00:26:40.304 --> 00:26:41.328
$110.

197
00:26:41.839 --> 00:26:44.899
Don't flash it around here. Come on.

198
00:26:48.913 --> 00:26:51.347
Wait a minute. 
You left your suitcase.

199
00:26:51.382 --> 00:26:54.408
Bus leaving for Los Angeles,
San Diego, Phoenix....


200
00:26:56.921 --> 00:26:59.082
-Want something to eat?
-Sure.


201
00:26:59.423 --> 00:27:01.414
-Yeah.
-I'll be right back.


202
00:27:04.028 --> 00:27:05.893
The next departure will be...

203
00:27:05.996 --> 00:27:07.861
...Los Angeles to Chicago.

204
00:27:13.137 --> 00:27:14.627
Help you, sir?

205
00:27:24.481 --> 00:27:27.279
Change, sir. Sir! Change.

206
00:27:27.484 --> 00:27:30.078
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.


207
00:27:35.225 --> 00:27:38.217
-I've got 'em all, what do you want?
-You want one?


208
00:27:51.542 --> 00:27:53.772
Okay, new shooter comin' into the game.

209
00:28:04.455 --> 00:28:06.480
All right, guys, four.

210
00:28:06.557 --> 00:28:09.583
I got it. Who wants a hard-ways four?

211
00:28:09.626 --> 00:28:11.856
-Two to one.
-Two to one on the hard ways?


212
00:28:11.929 --> 00:28:15.023
Right. You got it.
What about you? Dollar here.


213
00:28:15.599 --> 00:28:18.500
Okay, roll 'em. Come on.
Don't touch this money.


214
00:28:18.702 --> 00:28:21.796
-Where does he think he's goin'?
-I don't know.


215
00:28:21.905 --> 00:28:25.432
-Hey, buddy, we ain't got all night.
-Honey, gimme some money.


216
00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:27.238
Come on, we're gettin' lucky.

217
00:28:27.311 --> 00:28:29.779
These guys don't know craps
from wheat or somethin'.


218
00:28:31.648 --> 00:28:33.115
Come on!

219
00:28:33.784 --> 00:28:35.775
No, I'm not giving it to you.

220
00:28:36.186 --> 00:28:38.245
What? No, you don't understand.

221
00:28:38.322 --> 00:28:39.448
I got to cover a bet.

222
00:28:39.523 --> 00:28:42.458
-I can't talk to you about it just now.
-Frank, I can't go out there broke.


223
00:28:42.626 --> 00:28:43.957
What?

224
00:28:44.628 --> 00:28:47.188
What're you doin' out there, anyway?

225
00:28:47.264 --> 00:28:49.755
Will you, for Chrissakes,
just give me some money?


226
00:28:57.908 --> 00:29:00.206
I saved that money.

227
00:29:12.322 --> 00:29:14.187
Two for San Francisco.

228
00:29:17.561 --> 00:29:19.893
-What are you doing?
-I'm tradin' these in.


229
00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:22.490
-San Francisco.
-Wait. We're going to Chicago.


230
00:29:22.566 --> 00:29:24.796
Not anymore.
You want to give me some money?


231
00:29:25.069 --> 00:29:27.230
-No.
-That's $37 change for you folks.


232
00:29:27.504 --> 00:29:28.994
-I appreciate that.
-Wait.


233
00:29:29.073 --> 00:29:31.132
You told me your friends
were in Chicago.


234
00:29:31.208 --> 00:29:34.609
Hey, I got friends in Chicago.
I got friends in Duluth.


235
00:29:36.113 --> 00:29:38.411
Now I'm gonna show you somethin'.
Sit down.


236
00:30:01.205 --> 00:30:02.797
What have I got?

237
00:30:09.012 --> 00:30:10.877
-You got it.
-All right.


238
00:30:13.083 --> 00:30:15.051
Oh, I must've skipped you.

239
00:30:15.285 --> 00:30:17.549
-You destroyed me.
-I sure did get lucky.


240
00:30:17.621 --> 00:30:19.953
Wait a minute.
Are you leavin' with the money?


241
00:30:20.791 --> 00:30:22.383
Well, I won it.

242
00:30:22.459 --> 00:30:24.654
Hey, mate.
I want a shot to get it back.


243
00:30:25.696 --> 00:30:28.790
Fuck you, Commodore.
I won this money.


244
00:30:31.068 --> 00:30:32.467
All right?

245
00:30:36.373 --> 00:30:38.307
It's all right with me, pal.

246
00:30:40.577 --> 00:30:43.569
-Good meetin' with ya.
-Come on, Jim.


247
00:30:44.815 --> 00:30:47.010
Wait a minute. Let's play.

248
00:30:54.658 --> 00:30:58.059
Did you see that good-looking girl
that I was talking to leave here?


249
00:30:59.096 --> 00:31:00.825
No, I don't know where she went.

250
00:31:29.259 --> 00:31:30.624
Okay, you can turn 'em on.

251
00:31:30.694 --> 00:31:33.185
I told you we shouldn'a hooked this
up in the rain in the first place.


252
00:31:33.263 --> 00:31:34.628
Finish up, already.

253
00:31:34.698 --> 00:31:36.723
-You check the connections?
-Yes, I checked the connections.


254
00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.631
-Did you check the switch?
-I checked the switch.


255
00:31:38.702 --> 00:31:40.135
Well, go check the hookup.

256
00:31:40.204 --> 00:31:43.435
Your boss say, "Sign work both
day and night." I wanna lights on.


257
00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.038
-Want a cup of coffee, Nick?
-Turn 'em on.


258
00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:47.336
He's checkin' the hookup.

259
00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:50.380
Well, hurry up.
I wanna see lights on.


260
00:31:50.747 --> 00:31:52.044
Turn on.

261
00:31:52.783 --> 00:31:54.717
Where the hell is it, anyhow?

262
00:31:54.952 --> 00:31:58.115
Go around there,
he said it's around to the left.


263
00:31:59.957 --> 00:32:02.619
Yeah, I think I've found it.

264
00:32:29.453 --> 00:32:32.149
He would have found us anyway.

265
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:35.185
You don't know him, Frank.

266
00:32:35.259 --> 00:32:37.853
He would've followed us,
and he would have found us.


267
00:32:38.462 --> 00:32:40.692
Don't lose sleep over it, Cora.
I'm just disappointed.


268
00:32:40.764 --> 00:32:42.755
I thought we had somethin'.

269
00:32:45.035 --> 00:32:47.128
You just don't know what it's like.

270
00:32:48.005 --> 00:32:50.303
Bein' a woman,
trapped in this kind of....


271
00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:56.310
You don't, you don't know.

272
00:32:59.016 --> 00:33:00.984
There's always a way, Cora.

273
00:33:02.753 --> 00:33:04.584
If we stick together.

274
00:33:17.334 --> 00:33:19.131
I didn't know what to do.

275
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:20.258
Cora!

276
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:29.601
I've got to have you, Frank.

277
00:33:30.981 --> 00:33:33.472
If it was just us....

278
00:33:35.919 --> 00:33:38.547
If it was just you and me.

279
00:33:40.223 --> 00:33:42.851
What are you talking about?

280
00:33:44.761 --> 00:33:47.821
I'm getting tired
of what's right and wrong.


281
00:33:51.301 --> 00:33:54.168
They hang people for that, Cora.

282
00:33:54.905 --> 00:33:56.736
Cora!

283
00:34:12.556 --> 00:34:13.818
Come here!

284
00:34:38.615 --> 00:34:41.311
Hey, Frank, it look good
from here, uh?


285
00:34:41.518 --> 00:34:44.385
Yeah. It's a hell
of an idea you had.

286
00:34:45.756 --> 00:34:48.190
Hey, neon, huh? Neon.

287
00:36:07.938 --> 00:36:10.065
All right?

288
00:36:12.742 --> 00:36:15.643
Ah, ring twice for danger.
And the door?


289
00:36:18.482 --> 00:36:20.848
Locked from the inside.

290
00:36:20.984 --> 00:36:23.043
And then down the ladder
and that's it.


291
00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:24.882
-Yeah.
-Okay.


292
00:36:32.162 --> 00:36:34.289
Do you love me, Frank?

293
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.262
Sure.

294
00:36:42.539 --> 00:36:44.336
You know I do.

295
00:36:51.715 --> 00:36:54.582
Don't worry about anything, okay?

296
00:36:56.753 --> 00:36:59.051
Don't tell me that.

297
00:40:37.774 --> 00:40:39.207
Evening.

298
00:40:39.576 --> 00:40:41.703
You knew I had
to stop here, didn't ya?

299
00:40:44.714 --> 00:40:47.182
She's beautiful.

300
00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:49.684
I come by here all the time.
When'd you put her up?


301
00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.714
-Just today.
-Had to be.


302
00:40:55.291 --> 00:40:57.486
What was that?

303
00:40:59.195 --> 00:41:02.096
-There's a damn cat up there.
-Oh, yeah.


304
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:10.803
Hey, they sound a lot like
babies cryin' sometimes, don't they?


305
00:41:11.708 --> 00:41:13.903
Yes, they do.

306
00:41:19.983 --> 00:41:22.451
Well, I expect I ought to
get back to work.


307
00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:26.250
Yeah, well, we all got to sometime,
that's for sure.


308
00:41:26.322 --> 00:41:28.586
That's for sure. 
Take care now.

309
00:41:28.691 --> 00:41:30.989
Yeah, I'll do that.

310
00:41:47.343 --> 00:41:49.208
Frank, get over here!

311
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.009
Oh, my God!

312
00:41:55.451 --> 00:41:57.316
What happened to the light?

313
00:41:59.823 --> 00:42:02.223
I hit him! I hit him!

314
00:42:04.427 --> 00:42:07.590
-What happened?
-I hit him and all the lights went out!


315
00:42:08.331 --> 00:42:10.993
Get on the phone. Call an ambulance.
The cop came by and saw everything.


316
00:42:11.067 --> 00:42:13.968
-The cop? What cop?
-Get on the phone!


317
00:42:15.371 --> 00:42:17.305
We're gonna die for this!

318
00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:28.977
Hello, Nick.

319
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.846
Nick, wake up.

320
00:42:44.467 --> 00:42:47.436
Come on, Nick. Come on, Nick.

321
00:42:51.975 --> 00:42:53.465
Nick, wake up.

322
00:42:56.045 --> 00:42:58.309
We'll know for sure
after we see the tests.


323
00:42:58.381 --> 00:43:00.975
It'll be about a week.
All of a week.


324
00:43:07.824 --> 00:43:10.452
Can I have the book, please?

325
00:43:16.532 --> 00:43:17.521
Thanks.

326
00:43:25.275 --> 00:43:27.675
All he knows, it went dark.

327
00:43:31.981 --> 00:43:35.075
If he'd have turned around, Frank,
they'd have hanged us for it.


328
00:43:43.793 --> 00:43:47.422
And something,
something put that cop there.


329
00:43:50.667 --> 00:43:53.534
It's an act of God,
those lights went out.


330
00:43:59.375 --> 00:44:00.364
Don't look back.

331
00:44:00.443 --> 00:44:03.173
-What?
-Don't look back. It's a cop.


332
00:44:05.081 --> 00:44:07.914
-His red light's on.
-Oh, God.


333
00:44:09.152 --> 00:44:11.620
No, no, leave 'em on.

334
00:44:14.824 --> 00:44:16.587
Bathroom upstairs?

335
00:44:17.493 --> 00:44:18.687
Ah, yeah.

336
00:44:21.831 --> 00:44:24.527
What's the ladder doin' there?

337
00:44:25.935 --> 00:44:28.096
I don't know.

338
00:44:29.605 --> 00:44:31.129
Hey, come here.

339
00:44:32.542 --> 00:44:33.941
All right. Sure.

340
00:44:52.495 --> 00:44:53.462
Hey.

341
00:44:57.233 --> 00:44:59.633
Cover's off this fuse box up here.

342
00:45:00.169 --> 00:45:03.434
I'd say that sucker stuck a paw in it.
Fried him deader than hell.


343
00:45:03.706 --> 00:45:05.674
Yeah. How about that?

344
00:45:06.009 --> 00:45:09.342
Must've been those guys
that were workin' on the sign today.


345
00:45:10.279 --> 00:45:11.177
Yeah.

346
00:45:13.249 --> 00:45:14.739
Sounds like that.

347
00:45:20.857 --> 00:45:22.984
Sorry about your husband, ma'am.

348
00:45:23.559 --> 00:45:24.719
Thank you.

349
00:45:27.764 --> 00:45:29.925
Thanks a lot.

350
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:43.235
I'll get a flashlight.

351
00:46:37.767 --> 00:46:40.861
I know it's tough...to go down
and see him.


352
00:46:49.712 --> 00:46:52.704
You're sure you don't want
me to drive?


353
00:46:59.455 --> 00:47:01.047
Hurry back.

354
00:47:59.582 --> 00:48:02.551
Take it easy guys, there's plenty here.

355
00:48:07.857 --> 00:48:10.417
Cut pie. Little portions.

356
00:49:06.148 --> 00:49:08.412
John Philip Sousa.

357
00:49:40.683 --> 00:49:43.675
I don't want to make love tonight.

358
00:49:58.567 --> 00:50:00.296
It's our last night.

359
00:50:01.037 --> 00:50:02.265
I know.

360
00:50:03.806 --> 00:50:06.434
I don't want to make love.

361
00:50:15.618 --> 00:50:17.950
Yeah, you're right.

362
00:50:20.022 --> 00:50:22.183
Me neither.

363
00:50:42.511 --> 00:50:44.911
Oh, Christ, Cora.

364
00:51:39.468 --> 00:51:41.732
It's all in the feet.
You must watch the feet.


365
00:51:43.205 --> 00:51:46.038
-Can I talk to you a minute?
-It is beautiful, believe me.


366
00:51:46.075 --> 00:51:48.703
-You just watch your feet....
-Can I talk to you for a minute?


367
00:51:48.911 --> 00:51:51.072
-And you will learn....
-Excuse me.


368
00:51:58.087 --> 00:51:59.850
I can't talk about it now.

369
00:51:59.955 --> 00:52:02.321
What do you mean,
you can't talk about it now?


370
00:52:02.358 --> 00:52:04.849
Four days already,
you can't talk about it.


371
00:52:07.296 --> 00:52:10.026
Yeah, and you don't understand.

372
00:52:11.434 --> 00:52:14.232
I can't do it anymore, Frank.
You understand?


373
00:52:14.437 --> 00:52:15.836
Why can't you do it anymore?

374
00:52:15.905 --> 00:52:18.931
What does that mean?
You can't do it anymore?


375
00:52:38.394 --> 00:52:40.862
-It's over.
-Come dance.


376
00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:44.297
What? What are you talkin' about?

377
00:53:34.416 --> 00:53:36.008
Bravo, Nicko.

378
00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.381
Come here.

379
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:22.424
Come here.

380
00:54:32.274 --> 00:54:35.209
This man saved my life.
I'm fond this man.


381
00:54:56.465 --> 00:54:59.059
Cora, my feets, you know.

382
00:55:05.441 --> 00:55:08.239
My feets. They're beautiful, huh?

383
00:55:09.912 --> 00:55:12.176
-Beautiful.
-You say it.


384
00:55:12.448 --> 00:55:14.177
You say it Greek.

385
00:55:16.952 --> 00:55:19.045
Nick, I can't say it in Greek.

386
00:55:25.628 --> 00:55:27.459
Come on, you say it.

387
00:55:35.137 --> 00:55:36.434
Say it.

388
00:55:43.479 --> 00:55:44.969
That's it.

389
00:56:04.166 --> 00:56:07.158
Come here. Now, you say it.
Is beautiful.


390
00:56:11.173 --> 00:56:12.663
Tonight.

391
00:56:13.175 --> 00:56:14.665
What?

392
00:56:17.513 --> 00:56:18.844
What?

393
00:56:55.117 --> 00:56:56.778
What're you doing?

394
00:56:57.853 --> 00:56:59.343
You're the guy's wife, Cora.

395
00:56:59.421 --> 00:57:01.685
You told me that.

396
00:57:03.625 --> 00:57:06.025
You were gonna leave me?

397
00:57:08.697 --> 00:57:11.860
-I was writing you a note.
-Were you writing me a thank-you note?


398
00:57:14.136 --> 00:57:17.003
-Is that what you were doing?
-Cora, look.


399
00:57:17.473 --> 00:57:18.565
Live here.

400
00:57:18.807 --> 00:57:21.071
Live with the guy.

401
00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:24.035
Took a chance, we didn't make it.

402
00:57:24.279 --> 00:57:26.008
Live with the man.

403
00:57:27.449 --> 00:57:30.247
He wants to have a baby.
You understand?


404
00:57:32.755 --> 00:57:34.222
He's changed.

405
00:57:34.757 --> 00:57:38.215
He says the accident changed him
and now I'm supposed to have his kid.


406
00:57:43.899 --> 00:57:46.595
How am I gonna do that, Frank?

407
00:57:57.613 --> 00:58:00.411
How am I supposed to have his baby?

408
00:58:01.183 --> 00:58:03.617
I can't have his baby.

409
00:58:05.487 --> 00:58:08.354
The only one I could have
a baby by is you.


410
00:58:13.228 --> 00:58:14.456
Okay.

411
00:58:23.038 --> 00:58:25.802
Say you won't leave me. Please.

412
00:58:27.209 --> 00:58:29.200
Just stall him, babe.

413
00:58:30.379 --> 00:58:32.074
Just stall him.

414
00:58:50.632 --> 00:58:53.658
-Going far?
-We're goin' to Ventura.


415
00:58:54.269 --> 00:58:56.669
A trip. A change of scene.

416
00:58:58.574 --> 00:59:02.101
-Is it much farther?
-It's a couple of hours.


417
00:59:04.379 --> 00:59:07.746
-That's it.
-What do I owe ya?


418
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:10.880
$1.44.

419
00:59:13.255 --> 00:59:16.486
-Okay. Here you go.
-Be right back.


420
00:59:32.875 --> 00:59:35.844
-Here's your change.
-I'm gonna drive now.


421
00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:41.042
You can't even walk.
What are you talkin' about, drivin'?


422
00:59:41.316 --> 00:59:43.250
-Now, get in the back.
-What?


423
00:59:43.318 --> 00:59:45.650
-Get in the back.
-Are you nuts? Are you nutty?


424
00:59:45.721 --> 00:59:47.689
-Mister, you don't want to--
-I'm drivin' this car home.


425
00:59:47.756 --> 00:59:49.485
-Come on, Frank.
-You don't want to drive tonight.


426
00:59:49.558 --> 00:59:53.324
-You don't want to drive tonight.
-What, do you own this car, big fella?


427
00:59:54.396 --> 00:59:56.728
-Get in the back.
-Just get in the back.


428
01:00:07.476 --> 01:00:09.239
That's it.

429
01:00:09.578 --> 01:00:11.739
You drive safely now, okay?
Goodnight.


430
01:00:24.786 --> 01:00:26.844
-Good wine.
-C'mon, Nick.


431
01:00:31.458 --> 01:00:33.484
Is nothing like to have a wife.

432
01:00:40.935 --> 01:00:44.495
-Cut it out, Nick.
-Don't worry. He's drunk.


433
01:00:57.351 --> 01:01:00.581
-Shit!
-Don't talk like that.


434
01:01:01.287 --> 01:01:04.257
It's boiling over, Nick.
I gotta pull over.


435
01:01:22.075 --> 01:01:24.167
Hey, wake 'im up.

436
01:01:41.794 --> 01:01:44.261
Wake up. The car's stopped.

437
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:47.964
Come on, wake up.
You gotta fix it.


438
01:01:50.301 --> 01:01:52.429
Frank, get out of the car.

439
01:02:06.217 --> 01:02:07.582
Shit.

440
01:02:08.619 --> 01:02:10.314
I'll fix it myself.

441
01:02:14.357 --> 01:02:16.987
What's a matter...with door?

442
01:02:21.866 --> 01:02:23.458
There, got it....

443
01:02:32.143 --> 01:02:34.110
Is he dead?

444
01:02:43.988 --> 01:02:44.977
Get in!

445
01:02:47.557 --> 01:02:49.923
Come on, Cora, get in.

446
01:02:58.534 --> 01:02:59.967
Drive.

447
01:03:14.983 --> 01:03:17.348
Put it in neutral.

448
01:03:29.997 --> 01:03:30.986
Wait.

449
01:04:48.774 --> 01:04:50.765
Now, Cora, come on.

450
01:04:56.148 --> 01:04:58.274
Do it...do it.

451
01:05:00.785 --> 01:05:02.946
Come on, Cora. Do it!

452
01:05:13.798 --> 01:05:15.288
Hurt me.

453
01:05:28.378 --> 01:05:31.006
Now, you got this on the dash.

454
01:05:31.782 --> 01:05:34.546
And you don't know where you got this.

455
01:08:03.994 --> 01:08:06.396
Oh, God! No!

456
01:08:19.276 --> 01:08:20.436
Stop!

457
01:08:24.982 --> 01:08:29.181
There's been an accident!
Please help me! Oh, God!


458
01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:33.486
Thank you.

459
01:08:45.101 --> 01:08:47.399
How are you today?

460
01:08:49.138 --> 01:08:50.105
Fine.

461
01:08:51.975 --> 01:08:54.876
Have you ever been in San Francisco?

462
01:08:55.245 --> 01:08:56.337
Yeah.

463
01:08:56.412 --> 01:08:57.505
In Buffalo?

464
01:08:59.849 --> 01:09:01.248
Who are you, mister?

465
01:09:01.317 --> 01:09:02.716
You know who I am.

466
01:09:03.586 --> 01:09:05.486
You did time in Buffalo.

467
01:09:07.155 --> 01:09:10.182
In Wichita, armed robbery,
reduced to attempted assault.


468
01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:12.591
-Could we talk about this another day?
-St. Louis you held up a card game.


469
01:09:12.661 --> 01:09:14.754
Moline, Illinois, 13 months.

470
01:09:15.197 --> 01:09:17.529
Assault on a railroad investigator.

471
01:09:17.599 --> 01:09:18.964
They gave me something.

472
01:09:19.034 --> 01:09:21.265
If you plead innocent and
make me try you for homicide...


473
01:09:21.337 --> 01:09:23.133
...l'm going to see that you pay.

474
01:09:23.205 --> 01:09:25.036
What're you sayin'?

475
01:09:25.375 --> 01:09:27.706
This have something
to do with this accident?


476
01:09:28.944 --> 01:09:31.310
-I wasn't even driving.
-Oh, you weren't even driving.


477
01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:34.143
You were too drunk to drive.
You were too drunk to walk.


478
01:09:34.382 --> 01:09:36.715
You have a witness
at the filling station, yes.


479
01:09:37.152 --> 01:09:38.948
Who do you think you're dealing with?

480
01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.454
-I know you killed him.
-Come on.


481
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:44.354
Why would I want to kill him?

482
01:09:44.426 --> 01:09:46.120
Oh, buddy, I saw her.

483
01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:47.988
I might kill for her.

484
01:09:48.397 --> 01:09:50.261
Why would I want to kill for that?

485
01:09:50.631 --> 01:09:53.293
Forget the girl.
They'll hang you for the money.


486
01:09:57.004 --> 01:09:58.698
What money?

487
01:09:59.072 --> 01:10:01.132
A $10,000 life insurance policy.

488
01:10:01.208 --> 01:10:04.040
Issued on Nick Papadakis
by Pacific Reliance...


489
01:10:04.077 --> 01:10:06.170
...his wife, the sole beneficiary.

490
01:10:06.446 --> 01:10:08.642
Does that look familiar, Frank?

491
01:10:11.052 --> 01:10:13.145
Don't play around with
the insurance company.


492
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.084
They don't like to lose.

493
01:10:16.424 --> 01:10:19.881
Mister, I swear I don't know nothin'
about no insurance policy.


494
01:10:20.093 --> 01:10:21.685
Oh, come on, Frank.

495
01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.855
Either she did it, or you did
it together. Now, which is it?


496
01:10:24.965 --> 01:10:25.953
I didn't kill him.

497
01:10:26.031 --> 01:10:27.863
Prove it to me, Frank.

498
01:10:27.901 --> 01:10:29.198
How can I prove it to you?

499
01:10:29.269 --> 01:10:30.462
Sign this.

500
01:10:33.873 --> 01:10:34.999
What is this?

501
01:10:35.075 --> 01:10:38.601
It's the only thing that'll convince me
and the jury of your innocence.


502
01:10:39.312 --> 01:10:40.973
All right, Frank?

503
01:10:41.547 --> 01:10:43.344
Let's get out of here.

504
01:11:05.204 --> 01:11:06.397
It's all right.

505
01:11:20.618 --> 01:11:22.050
My name is Katz.

506
01:11:22.954 --> 01:11:25.116
I'm representing you and Mrs. Papadakis.

507
01:11:26.424 --> 01:11:28.517
The two of you are going
to be arraigned tomorrow.


508
01:11:28.593 --> 01:11:31.391
Until then, anybody ask you anything...

509
01:11:31.562 --> 01:11:33.290
...you say, "Talk to the lawyer."

510
01:11:33.363 --> 01:11:36.333
Do you understand that, Frank?

511
01:11:36.367 --> 01:11:37.458
Yeah.

512
01:11:37.701 --> 01:11:38.668
Good.

513
01:11:45.975 --> 01:11:47.637
Did you sign this?

514
01:11:52.082 --> 01:11:55.779
Don't sign anything else, huh?

515
01:11:58.055 --> 01:12:00.216
You got yourself pretty banged up.

516
01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:02.951
Good. It'll look good in court.

517
01:12:04.494 --> 01:12:06.984
Hey, are you gonna see Cora?

518
01:12:08.863 --> 01:12:10.195
Yeah.

519
01:12:12.368 --> 01:12:14.359
Tell her I didn't mean it.

520
01:12:31.886 --> 01:12:33.649
It was broken in the act.

521
01:12:33.722 --> 01:12:35.986
'Cause it was used
to strike the victim on the head...


522
01:12:36.057 --> 01:12:37.821
...which caused his death.

523
01:12:38.227 --> 01:12:40.694
In your opinion could the victim's
injuries have been caused by...


524
01:12:40.762 --> 01:12:42.320
...an overturning car?

525
01:12:42.397 --> 01:12:43.091
No.

526
01:12:43.164 --> 01:12:45.997
I object, Your Honor.
This man is not a doctor.


527
01:12:46.067 --> 01:12:50.800
This man is an acknowledged expert
in the field of insurance fraud.


528
01:12:50.872 --> 01:12:52.203
This man is an interested party.

529
01:12:52.273 --> 01:12:55.208
If my clients were to be convicted,
his company, Pacific Reliance...


530
01:12:55.243 --> 01:12:57.802
...stands to save $10,000.

531
01:12:58.078 --> 01:13:00.239
Your Honor, I strenuously object
and request that...


532
01:13:00.315 --> 01:13:01.781
...his entire testimony be stricken.

533
01:13:01.849 --> 01:13:02.976
Overruled.

534
01:13:04.651 --> 01:13:06.586
Thank you, I'm finished.

535
01:13:09.656 --> 01:13:12.648
Now, Your Honor, at this time
I will submit a complaint and...


536
01:13:12.693 --> 01:13:15.184
...request for damages sworn
by Frank Chambers against...


537
01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:18.027
-...Mrs. Cora Papadakis...
-What?


538
01:13:18.398 --> 01:13:21.628
...for injuries sustained
in a car under her control.


539
01:13:21.734 --> 01:13:23.726
-I object to this complaint.
-What complaint?


540
01:13:23.804 --> 01:13:25.065
Under the California Vehicle Act....

541
01:13:25.138 --> 01:13:26.935
Did you sign something, Frank?

542
01:13:28.008 --> 01:13:30.238
Did you sign something against me?

543
01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:31.470
Sit down, Cora.

544
01:13:31.545 --> 01:13:34.708
You wouldn't do that to me, would you?
He wouldn't do that to me.


545
01:13:36.415 --> 01:13:39.908
-Your Honor, that is exactly....
-What did he sign?! What complaint?!


546
01:13:40.219 --> 01:13:41.948
This supposed complaint...

547
01:13:42.021 --> 01:13:43.352
...acts on the adjudication
of the matter...


548
01:13:43.422 --> 01:13:45.412
-Show it to me!
-...can have no bearing.


549
01:13:45.992 --> 01:13:48.050
I want to see it! I don't believe it!
Show it to me!


550
01:13:48.126 --> 01:13:49.150
Overruled.

551
01:13:49.728 --> 01:13:52.289
-Enter the complaint.
-I don't believe he says I did it.


552
01:13:52.331 --> 01:13:55.027
You cannot enter the complaint.
It was extorted from a man...


553
01:13:55.234 --> 01:13:57.828
...a seriously injured man
under the influence of drugs...


554
01:13:57.970 --> 01:14:00.267
...and extraordinary pain
without the benefit of counsel....


555
01:14:00.338 --> 01:14:01.327
I've ruled on it.

556
01:14:01.406 --> 01:14:02.772
Will you proceed?

557
01:14:29.533 --> 01:14:32.661
Under the circumstances of this ruling,
I have no alternative but...


558
01:14:32.736 --> 01:14:35.296
...to withdraw my plea of "Not guilty"
and to plead Mrs. Papadakis...


559
01:14:35.372 --> 01:14:36.634
..."Guilty as charged."

560
01:14:36.707 --> 01:14:37.969
State accepts the plea.

561
01:14:38.042 --> 01:14:39.668
Your Honor, I move to adjourn.

562
01:14:39.742 --> 01:14:40.834
Accepted.

563
01:14:44.081 --> 01:14:45.480
Wait!

564
01:14:48.385 --> 01:14:50.250
You're workin' for the state.

565
01:15:11.108 --> 01:15:14.167
He changed her plea to "Guilty."

566
01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:22.713
-You're making a terrible mistake.
-Just shut up.


567
01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:35.686
Okay, ready?

568
01:15:44.573 --> 01:15:46.404
Okay, this is my statement.

569
01:15:49.443 --> 01:15:51.911
We did it all.

570
01:15:53.181 --> 01:15:57.743
Frank Chambers and I planned it
and killed my husband.


571
01:16:46.866 --> 01:16:49.357
-I'll just be a few minutes.
-Fine.


572
01:16:59.912 --> 01:17:03.278
-I appreciate you seeing me.
-Okay, what is it? They're guilty.


573
01:17:03.382 --> 01:17:05.316
That's yet to be decided.

574
01:17:05.385 --> 01:17:06.816
They're guilty.
What you want me to do?


575
01:17:06.885 --> 01:17:09.410
I can turn around and plead
them innocent. I've got 48 hours.


576
01:17:10.288 --> 01:17:13.190
Look, they've tried to kill him
once before.


577
01:17:13.492 --> 01:17:16.188
Oh, that's very interesting
you should think that.


578
01:17:16.829 --> 01:17:17.922
On March 5th, there was a party.

579
01:17:17.997 --> 01:17:20.124
I've got a fucking Greek army's
gonna tromp in here and...


580
01:17:20.198 --> 01:17:22.667
...swear that Papadakis threw his arms
around Chambers and said:


581
01:17:22.867 --> 01:17:24.836
"That's the man who saved my life."

582
01:17:27.339 --> 01:17:28.703
I think you got it backwards.

583
01:17:28.773 --> 01:17:30.002
Off the record.

584
01:17:30.641 --> 01:17:31.436
Sure.

585
01:17:31.843 --> 01:17:34.402
You don't mean to sit there and
tell me you think they're innocent?


586
01:17:34.545 --> 01:17:38.846
That is precisely what I'm telling you.
And that's what I'm telling the jury.


587
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:40.577
The prosecution's got no case.

588
01:17:40.651 --> 01:17:43.118
They've got no evidence,
no witnesses, nothing.


589
01:17:43.321 --> 01:17:45.118
All they've got is you.

590
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:47.089
And what are you doin'?

591
01:17:47.393 --> 01:17:50.622
Don't forget.
I am talking to poor people out there.


592
01:17:51.528 --> 01:17:53.087
Now, that jury....

593
01:17:53.163 --> 01:17:54.756
They've got an attractive...

594
01:17:54.832 --> 01:17:57.891
...grief-stricken, young woman
on that stand on the one hand.


595
01:17:58.001 --> 01:17:59.160
On the other hand...

596
01:17:59.235 --> 01:18:00.967
...they've got you, pal.

597
01:18:01.105 --> 01:18:02.333
You and your...

598
01:18:02.406 --> 01:18:05.204
...big insurance company
trying to save ten grand.


599
01:18:07.977 --> 01:18:09.344
We'll see.

600
01:18:10.813 --> 01:18:13.442
What do you think?

601
01:18:14.551 --> 01:18:16.542
I still think they're gonna burn 'em.

602
01:18:17.119 --> 01:18:19.815
And if they don't...

603
01:18:20.057 --> 01:18:22.047
...you've cost your company ten grand.

604
01:18:22.792 --> 01:18:25.284
There goes your Christmas bonus.

605
01:18:25.463 --> 01:18:27.122
You wanna take that chance?

606
01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:32.661
I'm gonna show you a way
that you don't have to take a chance.


607
01:18:32.768 --> 01:18:34.827
Now what?

608
01:18:38.239 --> 01:18:40.175
Okay.

609
01:18:41.178 --> 01:18:43.701
This is Art Beeman, Claims Department,
Western Equitable.


610
01:18:44.013 --> 01:18:46.140
-Hello, Beeman.
-Glad to meet you.


611
01:18:46.215 --> 01:18:47.909
Tell him.

612
01:18:47.982 --> 01:18:49.414
Well...

613
01:18:49.483 --> 01:18:53.114
...my company issued
a $25,000 liability policy...


614
01:18:53.488 --> 01:18:56.926
...home, business, auto,
to Mr. Nick Papadakis, just...


615
01:18:57.426 --> 01:18:58.653
...slightly before his death.

616
01:18:58.726 --> 01:19:02.093
Frank Chambers
was a passenger in the car.


617
01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:04.020
He sustained various lacerations...

618
01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:05.964
...a concussion,
and severe back trauma...


619
01:19:06.033 --> 01:19:07.830
...which will, I'm advised,
impair for the rest of his life...


620
01:19:07.901 --> 01:19:09.802
...his ability to walk.

621
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:12.361
If she was trying to kill her husband,
and in the process...


622
01:19:12.474 --> 01:19:15.910
...made my man, an employee
and passenger in her car...


623
01:19:16.011 --> 01:19:17.738
...a cripple for life.

624
01:19:17.879 --> 01:19:18.902
I'll go into court.

625
01:19:18.979 --> 01:19:22.177
I'm gonna sue Western Equitable here
for 25 grand and I'm gonna win.


626
01:19:25.819 --> 01:19:30.381
-Here's what he's prepared to do.
-Would you excuse us, please?


627
01:19:30.523 --> 01:19:32.151
I would.

628
01:19:41.468 --> 01:19:44.131
Western's in an unprotected
posture here.


629
01:19:45.005 --> 01:19:47.404
You're saying you'd reimburse?

630
01:19:47.908 --> 01:19:49.000
Precisely.

631
01:19:49.877 --> 01:19:53.903
Now, if you were prepared,
we'd pay the $10,000 death benefit.


632
01:19:54.981 --> 01:19:56.608
Cleared this with your people?

633
01:19:56.683 --> 01:19:58.114
Absolutely.

634
01:19:58.283 --> 01:20:01.344
Well, I think we can do business.

635
01:20:17.768 --> 01:20:20.932
Here you go, Frank.
I already signed for 'em.


636
01:20:21.038 --> 01:20:22.438
Go ahead.

637
01:20:23.275 --> 01:20:24.866
Come on, take it.

638
01:20:28.014 --> 01:20:30.277
Come here.

639
01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:37.278
They never had a thing.
They bluffed ya.


640
01:20:37.354 --> 01:20:38.515
Sackett bluffed ya.

641
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:40.683
Gets you to sign a complaint against
the woman, uses the complaint...


642
01:20:40.792 --> 01:20:44.626
...to get her to confess
and you both walk the plank.


643
01:20:44.763 --> 01:20:47.697
Get it?

644
01:20:47.766 --> 01:20:50.291
Come on, my boy.
You're goin' home.


645
01:20:50.868 --> 01:20:53.803
-Come on, we'll get you changed.
-You're kiddin'.


646
01:20:55.072 --> 01:20:56.699
You're kidding.

647
01:20:56.808 --> 01:20:59.140
Here you go.

648
01:21:00.977 --> 01:21:04.435
-She's free?
-That is correct.


649
01:21:04.582 --> 01:21:06.675
-But....
-But what?


650
01:21:06.783 --> 01:21:07.977
She confessed.

651
01:21:08.053 --> 01:21:10.919
Luckily, though, she confessed
to my assistant, Kennedy.


652
01:21:10.987 --> 01:21:13.718
The red-headed guy.
I bet you thought he was a cop.


653
01:21:13.924 --> 01:21:15.481
Yeah, I did.

654
01:21:15.593 --> 01:21:18.391
-Well, he wasn't. He works for me.
-Really?


655
01:21:20.163 --> 01:21:22.223
Thought it might be a good idea
for her to get it off her chest...


656
01:21:22.299 --> 01:21:23.356
...before they locked her up.

657
01:21:23.434 --> 01:21:25.299
She was very upset.

658
01:21:27.436 --> 01:21:29.668
Let's go out the back way,
avoid the press. Okay?


659
01:21:29.739 --> 01:21:31.900
Where are they goin'?
And where's the girl?


660
01:21:35.346 --> 01:21:38.745
The best part was the insurance.
Their Mr. Barlow, their expert...


661
01:21:39.048 --> 01:21:41.572
...he stands up in court,
says he made a grave mistake...


662
01:21:41.617 --> 01:21:43.677
...the whole thing
was an auto accident.


663
01:21:44.486 --> 01:21:46.477
Hell of a world, huh, Frank?

664
01:21:47.657 --> 01:21:51.184
Yeah. Where's Cora?

665
01:21:51.393 --> 01:21:53.190
Outside in a cab.
I told her to wait for Kennedy.


666
01:21:53.263 --> 01:21:55.924
I knew I'd find you here, sneaking out.

667
01:21:56.063 --> 01:21:58.862
-Yeah, that's right.
-You'd best sneak out.


668
01:21:59.101 --> 01:22:00.796
The file stays open on you.

669
01:22:00.868 --> 01:22:02.302
On you and the woman, both.

670
01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:03.997
You put yourselves above the law.
You killed.


671
01:22:04.071 --> 01:22:06.006
Hey, I'm sorry,
you can't talk to me that way.


672
01:22:06.073 --> 01:22:08.098
-I can't?
-'Cause I been inside a court of law.


673
01:22:08.175 --> 01:22:10.168
You'll be back, my friend.
I know your type.


674
01:22:10.245 --> 01:22:11.543
I'll see you again.

675
01:22:13.114 --> 01:22:15.175
Spit on the sidewalk
and you'll die in jail.


676
01:22:15.251 --> 01:22:17.810
Hey, hey. Learn to lose!

677
01:22:35.902 --> 01:22:37.893
Thanks a lot.

678
01:22:38.572 --> 01:22:40.061
That's okay.

679
01:22:40.273 --> 01:22:42.208
You took our part, eh?

680
01:22:42.343 --> 01:22:44.401
And you made me $10,000.

681
01:22:49.783 --> 01:22:51.579
It's been swell.

682
01:23:29.255 --> 01:23:33.018
I had to pay him
the insurance money, the lawyer.


683
01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:35.826
Yeah, I know.

684
01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:38.887
I didn't even know
he had an insurance policy.


685
01:23:44.234 --> 01:23:47.567
Can't leave this state for six months.
I've got to call 'em every week.


686
01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:52.608
I'm gonna have a record.

687
01:24:10.595 --> 01:24:14.031
I didn't mean to turn on ya.

688
01:25:20.027 --> 01:25:23.155
That's mine.

689
01:26:05.506 --> 01:26:07.905
-She doesn't look that old.
-Well, that's her.


690
01:26:08.008 --> 01:26:09.906
I saw her picture.

691
01:26:10.877 --> 01:26:13.243
She's acting exactly
as I expected her to.


692
01:26:13.347 --> 01:26:15.870
She'll hear you!

693
01:26:16.048 --> 01:26:18.038
Wonderful pie.

694
01:26:18.084 --> 01:26:19.018
Miss....

695
01:26:20.352 --> 01:26:21.547
Keep the change.

696
01:26:23.121 --> 01:26:25.487
Thanks. Come again.

697
01:26:25.558 --> 01:26:26.547
Sure will.

698
01:26:26.626 --> 01:26:27.752
Miss?

699
01:26:27.826 --> 01:26:29.590
How about that chicken?

700
01:26:29.694 --> 01:26:31.560
I'll have it for you in two minutes.

701
01:26:32.697 --> 01:26:35.164
You think you could get in
and help out, huh?


702
01:26:42.808 --> 01:26:45.003
-You're doin' fine.
-I'm doin' fine.


703
01:26:45.044 --> 01:26:47.808
I'd be doin' a little bit better
if you'd do some work around here.


704
01:26:49.446 --> 01:26:52.814
What're you killin' yourself for?
We're leavin' in two months.


705
01:26:53.185 --> 01:26:54.378
That's what you said.

706
01:26:54.451 --> 01:26:56.078
Soon as your probation's up...

707
01:26:56.153 --> 01:26:59.385
-...we're leavin'. Right?
-You wanna leave, Frank?


708
01:27:00.524 --> 01:27:02.787
You can go now.

709
01:27:03.929 --> 01:27:05.656
You wanna stay...

710
01:27:05.727 --> 01:27:07.721
...then do some work around here.

711
01:27:12.102 --> 01:27:15.367
And will you use a glass?

712
01:27:15.573 --> 01:27:17.973
What are you, an animal?

713
01:27:24.814 --> 01:27:28.808
What're you gonna do
with the money?


714
01:27:31.688 --> 01:27:35.056
I'm gonna buy a new car.

715
01:27:41.431 --> 01:27:45.491
What the hell do you care
what I'm gonna do?


716
01:27:55.444 --> 01:27:56.775
Move!

717
01:27:59.015 --> 01:28:01.176
Move! Come on!

718
01:28:02.051 --> 01:28:04.314
You bastard, get out of there.

719
01:28:04.486 --> 01:28:07.649
Get out. Go on, move!

720
01:28:59.874 --> 01:29:02.535
-You folks need somethin'?
-No, thank you.


721
01:29:15.589 --> 01:29:18.147
There you go, gentlemen.

722
01:29:18.224 --> 01:29:20.886
I've been looking for you.

723
01:29:21.428 --> 01:29:23.726
Well, you found me.

724
01:29:23.797 --> 01:29:25.924
I saw your picture in the paper.

725
01:29:26.231 --> 01:29:28.494
Join the club.

726
01:29:31.537 --> 01:29:33.596
Here's a menu.
I'll be right back.


727
01:29:33.705 --> 01:29:36.607
You know, I knew you
since you were a little girl.


728
01:29:38.444 --> 01:29:40.969
I knew it was you.

729
01:29:41.046 --> 01:29:43.015
But I didn't want to call.

730
01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:48.516
I knew they'd lost track of you.

731
01:29:48.986 --> 01:29:51.683
I get The Courier still, from home.

732
01:29:56.127 --> 01:29:58.151
And I read about your mother.

733
01:29:59.298 --> 01:30:02.198
I was pretty sure you didn't know.

734
01:30:05.369 --> 01:30:08.099
Oh, you don't remember me.

735
01:30:08.739 --> 01:30:10.605
But I remember you.

736
01:30:30.393 --> 01:30:33.557
-Want me to call the probation people?
-No, don't call them.


737
01:30:33.598 --> 01:30:37.396
I'll be back next week, the latest.

738
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:43.666
I'm sure she'll be all right.

739
01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:45.674
Let me know, huh?

740
01:30:46.575 --> 01:30:47.871
Yeah, I will.

741
01:32:06.387 --> 01:32:08.352
What is this, a holiday?

742
01:32:09.924 --> 01:32:11.083
Closed.

743
01:32:11.625 --> 01:32:13.524
Come on, gimme a break, huh?

744
01:32:13.726 --> 01:32:17.424
What'll it take you, a minute?

745
01:32:17.563 --> 01:32:18.791
Where you headin'?

746
01:32:19.364 --> 01:32:20.594
San Diego.

747
01:32:37.817 --> 01:32:41.149
What've you got in the back there,
if you don't mind my askin'?


748
01:32:43.288 --> 01:32:45.279
Cats.

749
01:33:06.378 --> 01:33:08.743
What is this?

750
01:33:09.113 --> 01:33:10.579
Three cats.

751
01:33:10.881 --> 01:33:13.111
What are they, drugged?

752
01:33:13.184 --> 01:33:15.412
No. They're tired.

753
01:33:17.186 --> 01:33:19.713
They're very tired.

754
01:33:19.823 --> 01:33:23.590
These cats are drugged.
No. I tell you they will not perform.


755
01:33:23.661 --> 01:33:26.686
I will not get in the ring with them.
Take them out of here.


756
01:33:26.729 --> 01:33:28.893
All right. What is it you need?

757
01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:31.795
I told you. I need performers.

758
01:33:32.002 --> 01:33:34.697
-I need wild animals.
-And where do you get them?


759
01:33:34.838 --> 01:33:36.270
Gutierrez.

760
01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:38.863
-Where are they?
-Mexico.


761
01:33:39.677 --> 01:33:43.942
All right, you get the cats.
Join back up in Tucson on the 12th.


762
01:33:44.014 --> 01:33:44.810
You do it.

763
01:33:44.882 --> 01:33:46.349
-Good?
-Yeah.


764
01:33:47.116 --> 01:33:49.311
Anything else you need?

765
01:33:49.386 --> 01:33:51.785
Of course. A driver.

766
01:33:53.523 --> 01:33:55.047
Excuse me.

767
01:33:55.792 --> 01:33:56.919
Put your....

768
01:33:56.993 --> 01:33:58.983
Take the cats away. I'm sorry.

769
01:33:59.561 --> 01:34:02.359
You're right about that,
you know, miss.


770
01:34:02.432 --> 01:34:03.558
What's that?

771
01:34:03.633 --> 01:34:07.863
I drove a hundred miles with these
cats and...they didn't peep once.


772
01:34:07.971 --> 01:34:09.337
Is that so?

773
01:34:10.939 --> 01:34:13.807
Here's a fine little animal.

774
01:34:13.876 --> 01:34:15.639
What about that?

775
01:34:16.979 --> 01:34:19.676
And, who, might I ask, are you?

776
01:34:21.384 --> 01:34:22.940
Frank Chambers, miss.

777
01:34:24.285 --> 01:34:26.617
Pleased to meet you, Frank.

778
01:34:36.766 --> 01:34:40.462
You know what I'd do for you?

779
01:34:41.235 --> 01:34:43.601
Buy you a hat.

780
01:34:44.172 --> 01:34:46.104
Yeah, a big white one.

781
01:34:46.841 --> 01:34:49.173
-You'd like that, huh?
-Sure.


782
01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:10.852
I'm sorry about your mother, Cora.

783
01:36:10.922 --> 01:36:12.583
She was old.

784
01:36:15.526 --> 01:36:17.356
Let's get a drink.

785
01:36:17.428 --> 01:36:20.395
No, I quit it.
I'm not drinkin' anymore.


786
01:36:23.066 --> 01:36:27.094
I've been thinkin' about
a lot of things, Frank.


787
01:36:27.839 --> 01:36:29.807
Let's just go home.

788
01:36:53.496 --> 01:36:57.091
I'm going to have a baby.

789
01:37:00.803 --> 01:37:04.569
I'm going to have your baby, Frank.

790
01:37:06.909 --> 01:37:08.638
Do you want it?

791
01:37:11.947 --> 01:37:15.313
Yeah, I do.

792
01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:21.611
-Tell me you want it.
-I do.


793
01:37:21.656 --> 01:37:24.145
-You do?
-I do want it.


794
01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:27.560
-You do?
-Sure.


795
01:37:31.866 --> 01:37:34.164
Jeez!

796
01:37:34.702 --> 01:37:37.501
You're gonna have a baby, huh?

797
01:37:38.106 --> 01:37:40.699
Think about that, huh?

798
01:37:57.792 --> 01:38:00.520
We lost some business, Cora.

799
01:38:01.328 --> 01:38:03.592
I don't care.

800
01:38:06.768 --> 01:38:09.292
I closed the place for a week.

801
01:38:09.435 --> 01:38:13.030
Went to San Francisco.

802
01:38:13.739 --> 01:38:16.604
I don't care.

803
01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:26.443
I've been wrong, haven't l?

804
01:38:26.587 --> 01:38:27.574
No.

805
01:38:30.323 --> 01:38:33.850
Yes, I have. I know I have.

806
01:38:40.565 --> 01:38:44.399
I've been makin' our life hell here.

807
01:38:51.877 --> 01:38:53.867
But I'm gonna change now, Frank.

808
01:38:58.518 --> 01:38:59.607
'Cause...

809
01:39:00.919 --> 01:39:02.580
...if we got each other...

810
01:39:05.257 --> 01:39:07.920
...then, we got everything.

811
01:39:12.395 --> 01:39:16.458
I want you to forgive me, please.
Oh, God!


812
01:39:17.067 --> 01:39:20.229
Hey.

813
01:39:21.307 --> 01:39:22.295
Come on.

814
01:39:28.212 --> 01:39:31.340
So you want to know what I learned?
About babies?


815
01:39:34.485 --> 01:39:37.387
What the most important thing is?

816
01:39:40.291 --> 01:39:43.226
You always got to be natural with them.

817
01:39:45.763 --> 01:39:49.221
I'm always natural.

818
01:39:49.768 --> 01:39:53.794
'Cause they can tell, you know?
Young as they are, they know.


819
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:57.237
-Yeah, but--
-So what you gotta do is two things.


820
01:39:57.607 --> 01:39:59.337
First one....

821
01:40:00.143 --> 01:40:02.509
First one is, you gotta
follow your instincts.


822
01:40:04.413 --> 01:40:05.712
What is it?

823
01:40:06.782 --> 01:40:08.579
The second thing....

824
01:40:10.018 --> 01:40:12.544
Tell 'em to go away.

825
01:40:13.354 --> 01:40:14.946
Yeah. I'll get rid of 'em.

826
01:40:21.363 --> 01:40:24.696
-Closed.
-Can I bother you for a minute?


827
01:40:24.801 --> 01:40:27.133
-We're closed.
-I know. It won't take but a minute.


828
01:40:27.235 --> 01:40:28.327
Please.

829
01:40:29.104 --> 01:40:30.969
Just a minute.

830
01:40:40.549 --> 01:40:42.947
Mr. Kennedy. Remember me?

831
01:40:43.616 --> 01:40:44.710
Yeah, sure.

832
01:40:45.286 --> 01:40:47.277
-How's Mr. Katz?
-Yeah, right.


833
01:40:49.624 --> 01:40:51.717
I don't, I don't work
for him anymore.


834
01:40:52.159 --> 01:40:53.718
-Is that right?
-Yeah.


835
01:40:56.264 --> 01:40:58.094
What're you doin' now?

836
01:40:59.699 --> 01:41:02.691
As a matter of fact,
I'm not doin' anything.


837
01:41:03.403 --> 01:41:06.304
That's...that's why
I thought I'd drop by.


838
01:41:07.341 --> 01:41:11.175
You know, I thought maybe
you could help me out.


839
01:41:11.244 --> 01:41:13.510
Oh, yeah? ln what way?

840
01:41:14.014 --> 01:41:16.914
What do you need,
a couple of bucks or somethin'?


841
01:41:17.084 --> 01:41:19.882
I mean, I know
you're out of a job.

842
01:41:22.154 --> 01:41:26.454
You remember that confession
that I typed up that time?


843
01:41:28.461 --> 01:41:29.725
Oh, yeah.

844
01:41:29.796 --> 01:41:31.990
You mean that phoney thing
you and Katz dreamed up?


845
01:41:32.132 --> 01:41:33.758
Yeah, right.

846
01:41:33.897 --> 01:41:36.597
Yeah, well, you know,
when I left Katz...


847
01:41:39.872 --> 01:41:44.104
...l took the liberty of taking it
with me from his files.


848
01:41:47.013 --> 01:41:49.879
I thought the two
of you might like it.

849
01:41:55.053 --> 01:41:57.180
Nice place here.

850
01:41:59.893 --> 01:42:02.554
You want $100?

851
01:42:04.631 --> 01:42:08.065
I want ten grand.

852
01:42:08.967 --> 01:42:11.959
Ten grand?
What are you crazy, Bozo?


853
01:42:12.171 --> 01:42:14.434
What are you, insane?
We gave the money to Katz.


854
01:42:14.538 --> 01:42:16.303
Who cares? I just want the money.

855
01:42:16.375 --> 01:42:18.434
Get it for me.

856
01:42:18.676 --> 01:42:20.643
Sell the place.

857
01:42:20.879 --> 01:42:23.311
Bring me ten or I mail the confession
off to Sackett and you die.


858
01:42:23.381 --> 01:42:25.042
The End.

859
01:43:01.817 --> 01:43:04.445
Fuck with my family.

860
01:43:06.288 --> 01:43:08.416
Where's the paper?
Where's the paper?


861
01:43:08.491 --> 01:43:11.427
-I can't tell you.
-Where's the paper?


862
01:43:13.929 --> 01:43:16.022
-I got it in the bank.
-In the bank?


863
01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:17.999
-Which one?
-I can't tell you.


864
01:43:18.067 --> 01:43:20.059
Which one?

865
01:43:20.902 --> 01:43:22.734
Which one?

866
01:43:24.174 --> 01:43:25.470
Which one?

867
01:43:25.875 --> 01:43:27.602
Glendale Trust.

868
01:43:46.528 --> 01:43:48.018
Get the gun.

869
01:43:55.903 --> 01:43:58.736
-How do you feel?
-I feel great.


870
01:43:58.973 --> 01:44:01.701
I'll get back as soon as I can.
You want anything from town?


871
01:44:01.774 --> 01:44:03.743
No.

872
01:44:05.547 --> 01:44:08.038
Let's go, Kennedy.

873
01:44:12.386 --> 01:44:14.218
You folks open?

874
01:44:16.789 --> 01:44:17.848
Sure.

875
01:44:43.016 --> 01:44:45.506
There you go.

876
01:45:14.846 --> 01:45:16.369
Cora?

877
01:46:19.176 --> 01:46:21.006
Your friend came by.

878
01:46:27.448 --> 01:46:29.041
You bastard!

879
01:46:34.957 --> 01:46:38.186
Don't come near me.

880
01:46:41.798 --> 01:46:44.287
You're scum, Frank.

881
01:46:46.568 --> 01:46:49.594
I knew that when I met you.

882
01:46:49.737 --> 01:46:51.796
You'll never change.

883
01:46:59.914 --> 01:47:01.542
Your confession.

884
01:47:12.525 --> 01:47:16.359
I don't even need it.
I never did.


885
01:47:16.964 --> 01:47:21.333
They tried me for it once.
They can't touch me now.


886
01:47:22.935 --> 01:47:26.895
You understand?
It's in the Constitution.


887
01:47:29.176 --> 01:47:31.438
Didn't you know that, Frank?

888
01:47:36.850 --> 01:47:39.250
But they can try you.

889
01:47:43.557 --> 01:47:45.955
They can still try you.

890
01:48:04.710 --> 01:48:06.870
Who're you callin'?

891
01:49:39.701 --> 01:49:40.999
I'm cold.

892
01:50:04.393 --> 01:50:05.983
You sure about that?

893
01:51:04.684 --> 01:51:06.445
I want to marry ya.

894
01:51:21.132 --> 01:51:24.692
You just want to shut me up.

895
01:51:26.838 --> 01:51:29.567
If I wanted to shut you up,
I'd have shut you up.


896
01:51:33.777 --> 01:51:36.576
I want to marry ya.

897
01:51:45.154 --> 01:51:47.851
Is that what you want?

898
01:51:48.192 --> 01:51:49.216
Yeah.

899
01:51:53.496 --> 01:51:54.520
Today.

900
01:52:37.205 --> 01:52:39.196
You want to wait till the weekend?

901
01:53:07.368 --> 01:53:10.893
You know, I been thinkin'.

902
01:53:11.104 --> 01:53:14.542
Maybe we ought to sell that place, huh?

903
01:53:14.876 --> 01:53:18.777
It ain't bad, honey.
For kids...keep pets.


904
01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:35.786
Walking there?

905
01:53:35.963 --> 01:53:37.726
Why not?

906
01:53:44.736 --> 01:53:47.332
You got a beer there? Huh?

907
01:53:53.346 --> 01:53:55.711
-There you go.
-Got the opener?


908
01:53:55.881 --> 01:53:56.678
Yep.

909
01:53:59.617 --> 01:54:01.745
That's it. That's it.

910
01:54:10.028 --> 01:54:12.825
-Cora? What's wrong?
-It's okay.


911
01:54:12.897 --> 01:54:14.332
-What's wrong?
-It's okay.


912
01:54:14.399 --> 01:54:15.729
-You all right?
-Just hurt for a minute.


913
01:54:15.801 --> 01:54:17.792
-You sure?
-Yeah.


914
01:54:18.837 --> 01:54:20.805
-No, it's okay.
-No, come on. Get in.


915
01:54:21.038 --> 01:54:22.631
Take it easy.

916
01:54:25.043 --> 01:54:27.170
I'll get over this in just a minute.

917
01:54:27.477 --> 01:54:29.946
I just feel dizzy.

918
01:54:30.182 --> 01:54:32.309
We'll get somebody to look at you.

919
01:54:32.384 --> 01:54:35.375
-No, I'm fine.
-Hey, you listen to me.


920
01:54:51.535 --> 01:54:53.731
I just want to go home.
Really, Frank.


921
01:54:56.106 --> 01:54:58.507
I'm gonna have you looked at.

922
01:54:58.876 --> 01:55:01.400
I just felt a little funny.

923
01:55:01.611 --> 01:55:04.078
Like I strained something.

924
01:55:04.182 --> 01:55:05.910
That's what I mean.

925
01:55:41.018 --> 01:55:43.575
Feelin' a little better? Huh?

926
01:55:44.286 --> 01:55:45.685
Feel great.

927
01:55:45.755 --> 01:55:47.346
-Yeah?
-Yeah.


928
01:55:47.389 --> 01:55:48.516
Good.

929
01:55:48.591 --> 01:55:50.752
Yeah.

930
01:55:50.825 --> 01:55:52.315
You do?

931
01:55:52.393 --> 01:55:54.826
Why shouldn't l?
