1
00:01:55.883 --> 00:01:57.250
Dammit!

2
00:01:57.318 --> 00:01:58.152
First day.

3
00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:18.772
What'd you do?

4
00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:19.839
Excuse me.

5
00:02:19.907 --> 00:02:21.607
What are you seeing the principal for?

6
00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:22.441
Vandalism?

7
00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.143
Smoking pot in the boys room?

8
00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:26.078
Bring a weapon to school? What?

9
00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.749
No, it's personal.

10
00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.083
Ooh, personal.

11
00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:33.185
Wait.

12
00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:34.788
You're the new kid, aren't ya?

13
00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:35.988
Busted.

14
00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:37.256
Tonya Michaels?

15
00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:39.927
Consider me the welcoming committee.

16
00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:40.861
Follow me.

17
00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:45.097
So what brings you to Willow Falls?

18
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:47.334
Kinda late in the year,
don't you think?


19
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:48.502
Well, my parents split.

20
00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.237
My mom's a nurse and
this is the only place


21
00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:51.737
that she could find work.

22
00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:52.873
Meaning what?

23
00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.274
Huh?

24
00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.208
What are you implying?
This place is just some shit hole?


25
00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:57.377
- No, no, I...
- Not good enough for you?


26
00:02:57.444 --> 00:03:00.280
I didn't mean that
it was some shit hole.


27
00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:01.615
Relax.

28
00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:02.884
I'm just fucking with ya.

29
00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:06.187
Welcome, new fish.

30
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.822
You got some major balls
coming to this town.


31
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.758
Most of us just
wanna get the hell out.

32
00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:13.094
Yeah, why is that?

33
00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:27.241
It's a pleasure being your tour guide.

34
00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:30.277
Before I forget.

35
00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:43.557
Mr. Mitchell.

36
00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:47.827
We pride ourselves on
punctuality at this school.


37
00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:49.330
Ain't that right, Ms. Michaels?

38
00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.166
I was just
showing him the way.


39
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.402
That's sweet of you.

40
00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:56.836
Class.

41
00:03:57.837 --> 00:03:58.705
Now.

42
00:04:09.383 --> 00:04:11.719
Look, I know why you
called me down here.


43
00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.054
Maybe we should talk
about this in private.


44
00:04:15.122 --> 00:04:17.123
There's not really
much to talk about.


45
00:04:21.128 --> 00:04:23.598
I talked to your
principal at your old school


46
00:04:25.032 --> 00:04:26.032
about what happened.

47
00:04:27.034 --> 00:04:28.368
Past is the past.

48
00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:30.337
And sir, I'd really appreciate
if we could keep it there.


49
00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:31.070
I hear you.

50
00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:33.741
Let's talk about it anyway.

51
00:04:34.942 --> 00:04:35.810
After you.

52
00:04:43.817 --> 00:04:44.719
Nice office.

53
00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:13.647
Damn!

54
00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:17.685
Hey, honey.

55
00:05:18.786 --> 00:05:20.887
I didn't know you would be home.

56
00:05:20.954 --> 00:05:22.323
My shift ends at 10.

57
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.423
Oh!

58
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:25.726
Yeah.

59
00:05:25.793 --> 00:05:26.460
Right.

60
00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:30.797
How was your first shift?

61
00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:31.897
It was okay.

62
00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:34.135
Listen, I really need
to get some sleep.


63
00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:36.503
Can you and Patrick-

64
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.971
TJ!

65
00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:39.339
He works at the bank.

66
00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:42.875
He took me to Dairy Queen.

67
00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:45.111
He's a really, really nice guy.

68
00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.048
You're really gonna like him.

69
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.683
Can you do me a favor, hun?

70
00:05:50.584 --> 00:05:54.221
When you meet him,
could you call him, dad?


71
00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:03.830
Okay.

72
00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:05.799
Goodnight.

73
00:06:08.135 --> 00:06:13.140
Night.

74
00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:31.458
Swing the hammer.

75
00:06:34.094 --> 00:06:36.062
Challenge the strong man.

76
00:06:36.128 --> 00:06:37.330
Swing the hammer.

77
00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:41.901
Pussies.

78
00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:44.970
Challenge the strong man.

79
00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:46.939
Swing the hammer.

80
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.912
Three in a row is a winner.

81
00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:54.146
Okay. Okay.

82
00:06:54.214 --> 00:06:55.815
Bon Jovi, that's enough.

83
00:06:55.883 --> 00:06:57.484
Come on over, that's enough.

84
00:06:57.551 --> 00:06:58.450
You're not a winner?
You're a loser.


85
00:06:58.517 --> 00:06:59.385
Take off.

86
00:07:03.522 --> 00:07:05.426
So what are your
friends? Carnies?


87
00:07:06.493 --> 00:07:07.361
Funny.

88
00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:09.496
Let me guess.

89
00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:11.363
In your old town,
you and your friends


90
00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:14.301
got drunk in the McDonald's
parking lot and did wheelies.


91
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.909
Top that, bitches.

92
00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:28.614
What's up, babe?

93
00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:30.984
I was wondering
when you'd get here.


94
00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:31.919
Fuck off.

95
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.022
I decided to drag the new kid
out to have some fun with us.


96
00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:38.224
This is Chris Mitchell.

97
00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.161
Tonya does love her strays.

98
00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:43.330
This is Zack.

99
00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:47.034
He seems like a big jerk,
but then you find out, he is.


100
00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:50.570
You used to love jerking it.

101
00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:53.306
Now you jerk yourself.

102
00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:55.842
Shut up.

103
00:07:57.109 --> 00:07:59.479
You look like a laffy taffy
in that, you know that?


104
00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:02.548
What is it? A buck a piece?

105
00:08:02.616 --> 00:08:04.183
Yes, sir. Buck a piece.

106
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.053
Three in a row, big time winner.

107
00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:13.493
Today, please.

108
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.972
You got this.

109
00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:30.576
How about you, tough guy?

110
00:08:30.644 --> 00:08:31.512
Number three?

111
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.056
- Jeez!
- Mr. Chuckles here is Brett.


112
00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:45.090
Nice to meet you.

113
00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:46.526
Yeah, you too.

114
00:08:46.593 --> 00:08:47.461
Cotton candy?

115
00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:50.162
Nah, I'm good.

116
00:09:11.685 --> 00:09:12.553
You know it.

117
00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:14.487
- Let's go.
- Cotton candy?


118
00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:15.221
Yeah.

119
00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:19.960
See you after the carnival.

120
00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.234
Come.

121
00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:29.235
Come, my friend.

122
00:09:30.704 --> 00:09:31.572
Come inside.

123
00:09:36.243 --> 00:09:37.111
Come inside.

124
00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:39.412
What do you want, man?

125
00:09:40.546 --> 00:09:41.613
What are your
future, my friend.


126
00:09:41.681 --> 00:09:42.681
Sit down.

127
00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:44.117
I'm not paying you.

128
00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:45.052
It's free.

129
00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:48.221
Yes.

130
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:50.190
Your hand.

131
00:09:57.064 --> 00:09:57.932
Yes.

132
00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:04.770
There's a man from your past.

133
00:10:04.838 --> 00:10:07.140
You need to reconnect with him.

134
00:10:07.206 --> 00:10:09.275
What are you talking about?

135
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.484
You will have a long and
prosperous life, my friend.


136
00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:20.621
Get off me, you freak?

137
00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:23.056
What's the hold up?

138
00:10:50.883 --> 00:10:52.318
You want some?

139
00:10:55.754 --> 00:10:57.090
Yeah, I didn't think so.

140
00:10:58.291 --> 00:11:01.561
The way you're drinking
that beer, like a pussy?


141
00:11:09.668 --> 00:11:11.104
All right, hand it over.

142
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.036
We should do a toast to Laura.

143
00:11:44.436 --> 00:11:45.305
Bro.

144
00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:47.640
Dick move.

145
00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:48.541
What?

146
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:51.145
Who's Laura?

147
00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:53.646
Tonya's little sister.

148
00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:56.483
Oh, you never mentioned
you have a sister.


149
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:57.718
Had a sister.

150
00:11:59.418 --> 00:12:00.253
What happened?

151
00:12:01.854 --> 00:12:02.888
She went missing.

152
00:12:02.955 --> 00:12:04.423
Missing.

153
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.492
We all know what happened.

154
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.828
Edith Cranston got to her.

155
00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:09.895
What?

156
00:12:09.963 --> 00:12:13.333
She used to run
this daycare center.


157
00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:19.205
One day Laura was there and
then no one ever saw her again.


158
00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:25.012
Look, I don't want
to talk about that.


159
00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:26.479
It's okay, babe.

160
00:12:26.546 --> 00:12:28.214
It's not okay.

161
00:12:28.281 --> 00:12:29.516
It's never gonna be okay.

162
00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.753
Look, we can't
get her to confess,


163
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.823
but we can make
that old hag suffer.


164
00:12:37.224 --> 00:12:38.525
Oh yeah.

165
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:39.460
I'm feelin' it.

166
00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:43.363
I think it's time we
pay her another visit.


167
00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:53.338
Where are we going?

168
00:12:53.406 --> 00:12:54.641
It's an old tradition.

169
00:12:55.941 --> 00:12:57.176
You'll see.

170
00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.248
All right, Mr. Chuckles.

171
00:13:20.599 --> 00:13:24.805
So, fill me in on
this little tradition.


172
00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:27.673
You'll see.

173
00:13:27.739 --> 00:13:29.274
We're going to Cranston's.

174
00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:31.276
Cranston's? Why?

175
00:13:31.344 --> 00:13:34.479
We like to remind her
what kinda monster she is.


176
00:13:34.546 --> 00:13:35.547
Yeah?

177
00:13:35.614 --> 00:13:39.219
We flooded her
basement, cut her tires.


178
00:13:39.286 --> 00:13:42.321
One time we left flaming
shit on her porch,


179
00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:43.422
which is classic.

180
00:13:45.358 --> 00:13:48.161
And you know, she
really is a monster.


181
00:13:49.628 --> 00:13:51.263
- She's a witch.
- Bro.


182
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:51.931
She is.

183
00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:52.866
Everyone knows it.

184
00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:54.868
Your sister.

185
00:13:56.603 --> 00:13:57.270
What happened?

186
00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:59.905
We don't know for sure.

187
00:13:59.973 --> 00:14:01.175
That's the hard part.

188
00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:04.177
On her birthday,

189
00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:07.281
she was at Cranston's daycare

190
00:14:09.549 --> 00:14:10.918
and she just never came home.

191
00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:15.354
The police questioned Cranston.

192
00:14:16.756 --> 00:14:19.193
They shut down her
daycare completely,


193
00:14:21.328 --> 00:14:22.896
but they never
found Laura's body.


194
00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:28.868
And that rich bitch,

195
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:33.540
she hired a fancy lawyer
and just got away with it.


196
00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:37.244
I'm sorry.

197
00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:41.348
Me too.

198
00:14:45.517 --> 00:14:46.954
The police forgot about Laura.

199
00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:50.290
But we never did,

200
00:14:52.492 --> 00:14:53.827
and we won't let her either.

201
00:15:24.824 --> 00:15:25.692
For Laura.

202
00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:30.029
For Laura.

203
00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:44.009
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:46.345
Pussy.

205
00:15:46.412 --> 00:15:47.413
Move your ass.

206
00:15:50.682 --> 00:15:51.652
Oh, shit.

207
00:15:56.089 --> 00:15:57.023
Going somewhere?

208
00:15:58.858 --> 00:15:59.659
Yeah.

209
00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:01.394
So get the hell out of our way.

210
00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:07.633
This is my property,

211
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.935
and you are trespassing.

212
00:16:11.937 --> 00:16:13.472
You're lucky my
husband is not here.


213
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.476
He would shoot you
right where you stand.


214
00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:18.577
And there's a little
more blood on your hands.


215
00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:26.520
I am not going to be
run out of my own home.


216
00:16:28.455 --> 00:16:32.758
You can shatter my windows
and I will replace them.


217
00:16:34.761 --> 00:16:37.831
You can throw a dead
animal and I will bury it.


218
00:16:39.766 --> 00:16:41.934
You can slash my tires,

219
00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:44.036
I will get new ones.

220
00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:48.407
But I'm staying right here.

221
00:16:50.877 --> 00:16:51.878
You wanna know why?

222
00:16:52.744 --> 00:16:53.813
Do you wanna know why?

223
00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:02.788
Because as much as you
hate me, I hate you more.


224
00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:05.459
I hate you more.

225
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.596
Then leave, 'cause
we're never gonna stop.


226
00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:12.865
Not until you leave or die.

227
00:17:13.932 --> 00:17:15.102
I'm not afraid of you,

228
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:18.537
but you,

229
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.045
you should be very,
very afraid of me.


230
00:17:34.621 --> 00:17:36.556
Where did you get
that necklace, Tonya?


231
00:17:47.967 --> 00:17:49.703
See you in hell,
you old woman.


232
00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:52.139
Yes, you will.

233
00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.541
And I'm gonna save you a seat.

234
00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:02.148
Now, get out.

235
00:18:36.649 --> 00:18:38.918
Oh my God.

236
00:19:22.894 --> 00:19:24.763
Penny for your thoughts.

237
00:19:30.202 --> 00:19:31.070
A penny.

238
00:19:33.038 --> 00:19:33.906
That's it?

239
00:19:39.277 --> 00:19:40.613
A kiss then.

240
00:19:47.719 --> 00:19:48.889
I'm trying to remember

241
00:19:51.423 --> 00:19:53.192
the adventures we had.

242
00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:56.530
The hopes,

243
00:19:58.765 --> 00:19:59.766
dreams,

244
00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:06.639
the children.

245
00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.113
But it's all gone.

246
00:20:18.351 --> 00:20:20.554
Edith, what are you...

247
00:20:27.693 --> 00:20:29.695
There's only darkness.

248
00:20:31.963 --> 00:20:33.065
Look at me.

249
00:20:38.104 --> 00:20:40.140
My dream was to be
with you forever.


250
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:44.344
And I am.

251
00:20:46.712 --> 00:20:48.147
So I'm happy as a clam.

252
00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:56.623
Good.

253
00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:04.017
Are you okay, Chris?

254
00:23:05.951 --> 00:23:06.819
I'm fine, ma.

255
00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:10.790
You don't seem like yourself.

256
00:23:10.856 --> 00:23:12.357
Are you sure everything's okay?

257
00:23:20.266 --> 00:23:22.869
You know, if you need to
talk to someone, I'm here.


258
00:24:08.046 --> 00:24:08.914
Hey.

259
00:24:11.584 --> 00:24:12.518
Hey, you.

260
00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:16.890
I got your call.

261
00:24:20.293 --> 00:24:23.195
Haven't seen you at
school the last few days.


262
00:24:23.261 --> 00:24:24.529
I got worried.

263
00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:25.565
You got worried.

264
00:24:25.631 --> 00:24:28.334
Actually I was
a little worried.


265
00:24:32.604 --> 00:24:34.139
Are you okay?

266
00:24:34.206 --> 00:24:34.873
Not really.

267
00:24:38.944 --> 00:24:41.146
You do feel a little hot.

268
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.884
Is this about Cranston?

269
00:24:50.623 --> 00:24:54.226
We were there the night she...

270
00:24:54.293 --> 00:24:55.562
- What if...
- What if what?


271
00:24:57.229 --> 00:24:58.529
I don't know, man.

272
00:24:58.596 --> 00:24:59.831
What if she had a heart attack?

273
00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:02.635
- What if we were the reason?
- We didn't do anything.


274
00:25:02.701 --> 00:25:06.171
And if anybody asks, you
keep your mouth shut.


275
00:25:06.238 --> 00:25:07.339
Or what?

276
00:25:07.405 --> 00:25:09.040
You're gonna throw a rock at me?

277
00:25:09.107 --> 00:25:10.441
You think you're such a badass?

278
00:25:10.508 --> 00:25:11.676
Well, I'm not some
little old lady


279
00:25:11.744 --> 00:25:13.245
you can just push around.

280
00:25:13.312 --> 00:25:13.979
I'm not afraid of you.

281
00:25:14.046 --> 00:25:15.147
Maybe you should be.

282
00:25:15.213 --> 00:25:17.448
Maybe you should come
up with a better line.


283
00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:18.618
Relax. Relax.

284
00:25:19.719 --> 00:25:21.386
You're both pretty.

285
00:25:23.521 --> 00:25:24.389
Hey.

286
00:25:34.065 --> 00:25:35.534
You're a good guy.

287
00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:37.136
I like that about you.

288
00:25:39.305 --> 00:25:40.172
You're sweet.

289
00:25:42.575 --> 00:25:43.508
She's gone.

290
00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:47.546
And the world is a
better place for it.


291
00:25:49.414 --> 00:25:52.050
Yeah, she was into
some dark stuff.


292
00:25:52.117 --> 00:25:52.717
I'm telling you, man.

293
00:25:52.785 --> 00:25:53.652
She was a witch.

294
00:25:57.556 --> 00:25:58.423
What?

295
00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:01.192
You saw how she was that night.

296
00:26:01.259 --> 00:26:02.261
Acting all crazy.

297
00:26:03.496 --> 00:26:04.363
Fucking witch.

298
00:26:05.431 --> 00:26:06.431
It doesn't matter.

299
00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:11.671
She's dead.

300
00:26:13.506 --> 00:26:15.008
And we can't change that.

301
00:26:17.276 --> 00:26:18.143
And we,

302
00:26:20.246 --> 00:26:21.113
we're alive.

303
00:26:22.715 --> 00:26:25.184
We've got our whole
lives ahead of us.


304
00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:31.190
So we should just bury
the past and enjoy it.


305
00:26:33.592 --> 00:26:36.094
Hey, are we good?

306
00:26:39.198 --> 00:26:40.065
Yeah.

307
00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:42.200
I guess.

308
00:26:44.636 --> 00:26:45.504
Then say it.

309
00:26:47.206 --> 00:26:48.373
Tell me we're good.

310
00:26:51.811 --> 00:26:52.979
Yeah, we're good.

311
00:26:56.315 --> 00:26:57.181
We're good.

312
00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:08.094
Hey, you wanna play Pac
-Man?

313
00:27:10.395 --> 00:27:12.197
I wanna play Pac
-Man.

314
00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:13.791
Hello.

315
00:28:13.858 --> 00:28:15.326
Hello, Christopher.

316
00:29:16.889 --> 00:29:18.257
Come with me.

317
00:29:21.594 --> 00:29:22.461
Hold on.

318
00:29:23.496 --> 00:29:24.464
We're not going
anywhere with you


319
00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:26.331
until you tell us
why we're here.


320
00:29:27.565 --> 00:29:29.201
Patience is a virtue.

321
00:29:32.371 --> 00:29:34.640
We're not exactly the
virtuous type, old man.


322
00:29:53.659 --> 00:29:54.794
Have a seat.

323
00:30:19.785 --> 00:30:20.585
Tonya.

324
00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:29.628
Zack.

325
00:30:36.335 --> 00:30:37.202
Brett.

326
00:30:45.344 --> 00:30:46.179
And Chris.

327
00:30:50.783 --> 00:30:51.617
You must be new.

328
00:30:54.987 --> 00:30:55.854
Doesn't matter.

329
00:30:58.489 --> 00:31:00.325
I'm sorry to hear
about your wife.


330
00:31:04.863 --> 00:31:06.465
I'm sure you're heartbroken.

331
00:31:10.803 --> 00:31:11.937
And I know you all are

332
00:31:12.004 --> 00:31:15.341
because whose house are
you gonna terrorize now?


333
00:31:16.475 --> 00:31:17.943
Look, we don't
want any trouble.


334
00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:20.879
No one wants trouble.

335
00:31:23.082 --> 00:31:25.617
Sometimes it just finds them.

336
00:31:25.683 --> 00:31:27.985
Look, enough with
the small talk.


337
00:31:28.053 --> 00:31:28.955
What do you want?

338
00:31:33.392 --> 00:31:34.594
Tonya, Tonya.

339
00:31:40.098 --> 00:31:41.732
If I got what I wanted, Tonya,

340
00:31:41.799 --> 00:31:46.806
this meeting would be
a whole lot less civil.


341
00:31:50.976 --> 00:31:52.378
Edith was different.

342
00:31:53.946 --> 00:31:56.249
She was more forgiving.

343
00:31:59.084 --> 00:32:01.519
So it seems like she
surprised everyone


344
00:32:02.653 --> 00:32:04.789
when she included
you in her will.


345
00:32:07.526 --> 00:32:08.994
Bullshit.

346
00:32:09.061 --> 00:32:10.263
She hated us.

347
00:32:11.829 --> 00:32:12.998
That's what I thought.

348
00:32:17.169 --> 00:32:18.271
Yet, here we are.

349
00:32:23.142 --> 00:32:24.309
For what?

350
00:32:25.411 --> 00:32:26.278
Read.

351
00:32:27.412 --> 00:32:28.748
You can read, can't you?

352
00:32:30.848 --> 00:32:34.118
Or was your school too far
from your trailer park?


353
00:32:34.186 --> 00:32:35.787
We don't have to take this.

354
00:32:35.854 --> 00:32:36.721
Sit down.

355
00:32:41.527 --> 00:32:42.995
I don't want anything of hers.

356
00:32:44.595 --> 00:32:45.463
Really?

357
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.970
Not even $100,000?

358
00:32:53.037 --> 00:32:55.473
Did you just say $100,000?

359
00:33:04.716 --> 00:33:06.450
What's the catch?

360
00:33:06.517 --> 00:33:07.385
Pardon me?

361
00:33:08.586 --> 00:33:10.454
With people like you,
there's always a catch.


362
00:33:10.521 --> 00:33:11.423
People like me.

363
00:33:15.027 --> 00:33:17.996
You don't know
anything about me.


364
00:33:18.063 --> 00:33:21.533
You don't know anything
about me or my wife.


365
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.002
We know all we need to know.

366
00:33:25.604 --> 00:33:26.706
So you think.

367
00:33:28.507 --> 00:33:31.876
If you knew anything
about Edith,


368
00:33:31.943 --> 00:33:33.979
you'd know there was
one thing she liked.


369
00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:36.614
And that was to play games.

370
00:33:37.783 --> 00:33:38.651
I like games.

371
00:33:40.686 --> 00:33:41.754
What kind of game?

372
00:33:42.821 --> 00:33:43.956
Simple ones, really?

373
00:33:46.057 --> 00:33:48.361
Now, are any of
you superstitious?


374
00:33:51.028 --> 00:33:54.799
Not afraid of ghosts or things
that go bump in the night?


375
00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:57.101
I don't believe
in any of that shit.


376
00:33:57.169 --> 00:33:58.704
So the answer would be no.

377
00:33:59.704 --> 00:34:00.772
It's a no for me too.

378
00:34:02.173 --> 00:34:03.608
And what about you boys?

379
00:34:11.083 --> 00:34:11.883
Good.

380
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:13.753
Well, the game's simple really?

381
00:34:15.853 --> 00:34:18.589
There's a phone
upstairs in the study


382
00:34:18.657 --> 00:34:19.792
at the end of the hall.

383
00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:25.130
All four of you must go
up there one at a time.


384
00:34:26.264 --> 00:34:27.766
There's a number
next to the phone.


385
00:34:27.833 --> 00:34:29.233
You call it.

386
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.635
You stay on the
phone for one minute,


387
00:34:31.702 --> 00:34:33.072
you get $100,000.

388
00:34:35.606 --> 00:34:36.874
That's it?

389
00:34:36.941 --> 00:34:37.809
That's it.

390
00:34:38.876 --> 00:34:39.811
Easy as pie.

391
00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:42.648
Who are we calling?

392
00:34:45.016 --> 00:34:46.117
You're calling Edith.

393
00:34:55.827 --> 00:34:57.897
See, she had me bury
a phone with her.


394
00:34:59.197 --> 00:35:00.599
Okay, now that's crazy.

395
00:35:04.168 --> 00:35:06.104
Edith was always
a little eccentric.


396
00:35:07.171 --> 00:35:08.106
Wait, so all we gotta do

397
00:35:08.173 --> 00:35:11.042
is stay on the
phone for a minute?


398
00:35:11.108 --> 00:35:12.576
One minute.

399
00:35:12.644 --> 00:35:13.512
That's it.

400
00:35:14.845 --> 00:35:16.248
Then you exit out the back door

401
00:35:16.315 --> 00:35:19.717
and the money will be
yours in the morning.


402
00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:21.886
And what if we hang up early?

403
00:35:21.954 --> 00:35:23.255
Then your money will be split

404
00:35:23.322 --> 00:35:26.459
between the people
who stay on the call.


405
00:35:27.258 --> 00:35:28.960
I still call bullshit.

406
00:35:29.027 --> 00:35:30.662
I don't know what you're up to.

407
00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:33.297
Read the contract.

408
00:35:33.365 --> 00:35:34.399
It's all legal.

409
00:35:34.465 --> 00:35:36.967
Legal or not, I
don't want your money.


410
00:35:37.034 --> 00:35:38.470
Hey, speak for yourself.

411
00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:43.508
If I get this, we're set.

412
00:35:45.744 --> 00:35:46.845
Zack, there is no we.

413
00:35:47.912 --> 00:35:49.615
You gotta get that
through your head.


414
00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:54.018
And I'm outta here.

415
00:35:57.956 --> 00:35:59.024
Screw your game.

416
00:36:00.358 --> 00:36:03.795
Tonya, before you leave, dear,

417
00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:08.633
there's one more thing
I need to tell you.


418
00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:11.036
What?

419
00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:15.039
Edith's death was
not an accident.


420
00:36:17.642 --> 00:36:21.780
The paper was kind enough
to omit the details,


421
00:36:25.916 --> 00:36:27.519
but Edith killed herself.

422
00:36:31.657 --> 00:36:33.124
That sucks.

423
00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:34.860
What does it have to do with us?

424
00:36:37.128 --> 00:36:37.996
Everything.

425
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.235
You see,
she left a suicide note.


426
00:36:45.704 --> 00:36:49.208
And in that note, she
made it very clear


427
00:36:51.108 --> 00:36:54.679
that your constant
threats to her,


428
00:36:54.746 --> 00:36:58.816
you and your little
friends over the years


429
00:36:58.883 --> 00:37:00.586
was more than she could bear.

430
00:37:03.688 --> 00:37:05.123
She was a strong woman,

431
00:37:06.824 --> 00:37:07.892
but she was depressed.

432
00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:13.063
And all those years of torture-

433
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:13.864
They were just pranks.

434
00:37:13.932 --> 00:37:15.301
They were pranks to you.

435
00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:20.572
They were devastating to her.

436
00:37:22.374 --> 00:37:23.242
Devastating.

437
00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:27.146
Then your little confrontation
with her the other night.


438
00:37:31.182 --> 00:37:32.784
That was the final straw.

439
00:37:32.851 --> 00:37:33.852
I was traveling.

440
00:37:36.188 --> 00:37:39.624
I wish to God I was
here, but I wasn't.


441
00:37:41.992 --> 00:37:43.327
She was all alone.

442
00:37:43.394 --> 00:37:46.130
She was afraid for her life.

443
00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:56.976
And she knew that not
one person in this town


444
00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:01.847
would protect her from
you or you or you.


445
00:38:03.414 --> 00:38:04.882
Oh God!

446
00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:05.583
I didn't even know her.

447
00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.719
But you were here.

448
00:38:07.786 --> 00:38:08.653
You saw it.

449
00:38:12.423 --> 00:38:13.291
Yeah.

450
00:38:16.128 --> 00:38:17.196
What are you saying?

451
00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:24.335
I'm saying, you let me
honor my wife's last wish


452
00:38:24.402 --> 00:38:25.737
by making the call.

453
00:38:31.476 --> 00:38:34.880
Otherwise, I'll go to
the police with the note.


454
00:38:37.816 --> 00:38:42.821
Make sure that you all
pay for what you did.


455
00:38:46.458 --> 00:38:49.193
I loved Edith more than life.

456
00:38:52.931 --> 00:38:54.199
Even more than revenge.

457
00:38:56.434 --> 00:38:58.237
That's why I'm
giving you a choice.


458
00:39:05.043 --> 00:39:06.811
Now, I'm gonna pour
myself a drink.


459
00:39:08.445 --> 00:39:10.281
When I get back, I
expect an answer.


460
00:39:27.965 --> 00:39:29.867
You guys aren't
seriously considering this,


461
00:39:29.934 --> 00:39:30.534
are you?

462
00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:31.469
Hell yeah.

463
00:39:32.603 --> 00:39:33.604
We may not wanna grow
up in the shit hole,


464
00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:36.273
we'll tell him about
this


465
00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.409
Right now I need this
money to get outta here.


466
00:39:42.581 --> 00:39:45.083
Crazy
as you say she is,


467
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.251
I have to admit I've
seen stranger things.


468
00:39:48.987 --> 00:39:50.856
I can't get the
police on my tail.


469
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:53.057
Why?

470
00:39:53.124 --> 00:39:53.992
You got a record?

471
00:39:56.061 --> 00:39:57.262
I just can't.

472
00:39:58.396 --> 00:39:59.931
A one minute phone call.

473
00:39:59.998 --> 00:40:01.432
There's four of us.

474
00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:04.236
We each call, we could
be gone in five minutes.


475
00:40:10.407 --> 00:40:11.743
So what's it gonna be?

476
00:40:16.181 --> 00:40:18.950
Do you make your call
or do I make mine?


477
00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:24.488
We're gonna do it, but
if you try anything...


478
00:40:24.556 --> 00:40:26.324
You don't have
to worry about me.


479
00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:29.827
I'll be outside
the back entrance


480
00:40:29.894 --> 00:40:31.896
waiting to greet you
when you're done.


481
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:35.299
Just one of you can
go upstairs at a time.


482
00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:38.771
The rest of you have
to wait down here.


483
00:40:40.237 --> 00:40:41.906
Don't go snooping around.

484
00:40:46.077 --> 00:40:48.180
Once one of you has
completed the call,


485
00:40:50.248 --> 00:40:54.086
the Lira clock
upstairs, it will chime.


486
00:40:55.586 --> 00:40:57.989
Then the next person
can take their turn.


487
00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.528
Zack.

488
00:41:03.595 --> 00:41:05.798
You're such a tough
guy. You go first.


489
00:41:08.266 --> 00:41:12.204
Brett, you like following
your brother's footsteps.


490
00:41:13.338 --> 00:41:14.339
You'll be second.

491
00:41:16.206 --> 00:41:18.810
Chris, you follow Brett.

492
00:41:21.211 --> 00:41:24.047
Tonya, you'll make
the final call.


493
00:41:24.115 --> 00:41:25.083
Lucky me.

494
00:41:28.686 --> 00:41:29.554
So good.

495
00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:33.156
I know that Edith's
looking down on us.


496
00:41:33.224 --> 00:41:36.894
Smiling knowing that her
final wish has been granted.


497
00:41:40.164 --> 00:41:41.099
Once we're done with all this,

498
00:41:41.166 --> 00:41:42.901
we can put the
ugliness behind us


499
00:41:42.967 --> 00:41:44.302
and we can start to heal.

500
00:42:12.097 --> 00:42:14.967
Well, that wasn't creepy at all.

501
00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:17.536
Hey, bro.

502
00:42:18.737 --> 00:42:20.037
It's just a phone call.

503
00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:23.208
I know that, dumb ass.

504
00:42:37.554 --> 00:42:38.422
Zack.

505
00:42:41.358 --> 00:42:42.226
Zack.

506
00:42:45.095 --> 00:42:47.565
You don't have to do this
if you don't want to.


507
00:42:47.632 --> 00:42:48.499
I'm fine.

508
00:42:50.501 --> 00:42:52.137
We're not all pussies like you.

509
00:43:23.233 --> 00:43:24.369
Let's do this.

510
00:44:36.173 --> 00:44:37.675
This house is whack.

511
00:46:35.492 --> 00:46:36.960
What the hell!

512
00:46:37.028 --> 00:46:37.896
Hello.

513
00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:39.963
Who is this?

514
00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:43.333
I'm so
glad you called.


515
00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.268
Okay.

516
00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:46.371
Fine, I'll bite.

517
00:46:47.405 --> 00:46:48.573
How're you doing this?

518
00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:51.374
Let's not waste
time with questions.


519
00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:53.311
Can you do me a favor?

520
00:46:54.579 --> 00:46:55.780
Yes ma'am.

521
00:46:55.847 --> 00:46:57.915
And what is it that
I can do for you?


522
00:46:57.981 --> 00:47:02.385
Be a dear
and look in the mirror.


523
00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:36.720
What the hell is this?

524
00:47:36.787 --> 00:47:41.793
You're
in my world now.


525
00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:43.594
You know what?

526
00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:45.329
The hell with this?

527
00:48:08.885 --> 00:48:10.654
Boys.

528
00:48:10.722 --> 00:48:11.822
Brett, get under the bed.

529
00:48:11.889 --> 00:48:13.457
No, Zack.

530
00:48:13.523 --> 00:48:14.624
I can't.

531
00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:16.693
There's monsters under the bed.

532
00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:17.561
Just do it.

533
00:48:17.628 --> 00:48:18.496
Come on.

534
00:48:30.742 --> 00:48:32.744
Unlock this damn door.

535
00:48:33.945 --> 00:48:35.579
How many times have I told you

536
00:48:35.646 --> 00:48:37.916
about locking the goddam
door in my house, huh?


537
00:48:40.617 --> 00:48:43.387
Oh, you're gonna
stand up to me now?


538
00:48:49.927 --> 00:48:50.795
Yeah.

539
00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:52.730
Let's see it then.

540
00:48:54.699 --> 00:48:56.534
Come here, you
little piece of shit.


541
00:48:58.668 --> 00:49:00.371
I'm not afraid of you.

542
00:49:00.438 --> 00:49:01.539
Are you a big man now?

543
00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:03.908
Yeah?

544
00:49:03.974 --> 00:49:04.976
Why don't you show me?

545
00:49:07.945 --> 00:49:08.947
Take your best shot.

546
00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.289
You're pathetic.

547
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:20.057
Both of ya.

548
00:49:25.463 --> 00:49:26.197
Come on.

549
00:49:26.264 --> 00:49:28.432
You know what time it is.

550
00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:35.638
I don't know why you
make me do this to you.


551
00:49:55.626 --> 00:49:56.828
Zack.

552
00:50:00.831 --> 00:50:01.699
Zack.

553
00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:20.451
Zack.

554
00:52:18.836 --> 00:52:19.704
Zack.

555
00:52:21.137 --> 00:52:22.706
Zack, Zack, Zack.

556
00:52:24.842 --> 00:52:27.579
You know you cannot run from me,

557
00:52:28.679 --> 00:52:31.548
because I am always
gonna find you.


558
00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:34.518
Dad.

559
00:52:37.787 --> 00:52:38.655
You.

560
00:52:42.059 --> 00:52:44.562
So just like I thought.

561
00:52:44.628 --> 00:52:48.999
You are still too much
of a pussy to fight back.


562
00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:50.767
Dad...

563
00:52:54.871 --> 00:52:56.840
You're a complete
embarrassment, Zack.


564
00:52:58.775 --> 00:53:01.512
I'm embarrassed
to be your father


565
00:53:04.914 --> 00:53:07.784
I'm gonna give you
one last chance


566
00:53:11.054 --> 00:53:13.290
to hit me, you piece of shit.

567
00:53:15.892 --> 00:53:16.760
I can't.

568
00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:20.198
I'm sorry, I can't.

569
00:53:24.335 --> 00:53:27.972
You can't?

570
00:53:28.039 --> 00:53:28.907
I can't.

571
00:53:30.775 --> 00:53:31.776
It's okay.

572
00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:37.648
That's a good boy.

573
00:53:40.818 --> 00:53:43.153
I just wanna go home.

574
00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.722
It's all right.

575
00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:47.691
That's a good boy.

576
00:53:48.925 --> 00:53:51.027
You're gonna go home.

577
00:54:11.382 --> 00:54:12.916
Son of a bitch.

578
00:54:23.394 --> 00:54:25.662
What kinda door
doesn't have handles?


579
00:54:26.731 --> 00:54:28.065
He's taking too long.
I want my money.


580
00:54:28.132 --> 00:54:29.365
Simmer down.

581
00:54:29.432 --> 00:54:31.001
It's only been a few minutes.

582
00:54:32.369 --> 00:54:33.170
Yeah. Yeah.

583
00:54:33.237 --> 00:54:34.104
All right.

584
00:54:57.427 --> 00:54:59.195
It's my turn.

585
00:54:59.262 --> 00:55:02.165
- Wait.
- I am not pussy.


586
00:55:08.905 --> 00:55:11.941
If Zack can do it, so can I.

587
00:55:12.008 --> 00:55:13.077
See you when I'm rich.

588
00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:21.117
Hey, would you
mind holding this?


589
00:55:21.184 --> 00:55:22.452
Yeah, sure.

590
00:55:22.519 --> 00:55:23.655
You can have it if you want.

591
00:55:30.293 --> 00:55:31.161
Weird day.

592
00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:36.365
You're fine.

593
00:55:36.432 --> 00:55:40.037
You're not weak, and
you're not a pussy.


594
00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:51.748
Shit.

595
00:55:55.452 --> 00:55:56.787
It's just a phone call.

596
00:56:27.483 --> 00:56:28.351
Hello.

597
00:56:32.956 --> 00:56:35.926
Hey, I'm calling about my money.

598
00:56:37.293 --> 00:56:39.931
You've called
the right place, Brett.


599
00:56:43.367 --> 00:56:44.235
Mrs. Cranston?

600
00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:46.871
Yes.

601
00:56:52.342 --> 00:56:53.210
You're alive.

602
00:56:54.445 --> 00:56:55.445
Holy crap.

603
00:56:55.512 --> 00:56:57.148
So this is all a joke?

604
00:56:58.249 --> 00:56:59.416
Wait, so you faked your death,

605
00:56:59.483 --> 00:57:01.119
and now you're fucking with us?

606
00:57:02.519 --> 00:57:05.222
Fucking with you
was the last thing I wanna do.


607
00:57:06.289 --> 00:57:08.324
And speaking of fucking
with you, Brett,


608
00:57:08.391 --> 00:57:09.359
how's your daddy?

609
00:57:13.931 --> 00:57:14.898
What did you say?

610
00:57:18.501 --> 00:57:20.505
How's Harliss?

611
00:57:26.342 --> 00:57:27.411
Where are you?

612
00:57:27.478 --> 00:57:29.613
I'm everywhere,

613
00:57:29.679 --> 00:57:34.851
and that is the amazing
thing about being dead.


614
00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:37.988
The things you learn.

615
00:57:39.322 --> 00:57:41.257
The things you see.

616
00:57:41.324 --> 00:57:42.859
I don't know what
you're talking about.


617
00:57:42.927 --> 00:57:43.995
Really?

618
00:57:44.061 --> 00:57:48.999
I mean, I knew your
dad was a horrible man.


619
00:57:49.066 --> 00:57:50.534
The way he beat your brother,

620
00:57:50.601 --> 00:57:53.537
I can't imagine treating
a child with my likeness-


621
00:57:53.603 --> 00:57:54.471
Shut up.

622
00:57:55.371 --> 00:57:56.405
Shut up.

623
00:57:56.472 --> 00:57:58.941
But you,
after his wife died,


624
00:57:59.008 --> 00:58:03.079
he started hurting you,
in unimaginable ways.


625
00:58:03.146 --> 00:58:04.114
I said, shut up.

626
00:58:08.152 --> 00:58:09.086
Do you remember

627
00:58:09.153 --> 00:58:10.421
your favorite
nursery rhyme, Brett.


628
00:58:12.456 --> 00:58:17.461
? Something very scary
is underneath my bed?


629
00:58:19.396 --> 00:58:22.834
Could it be a monster
underneath my bed?


630
00:58:26.637 --> 00:58:29.240
All you have to do
is stay on the call.


631
00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.108
And?

632
00:58:32.441 --> 00:58:35.612
Check to see if
the monster is under the bed.


633
00:58:37.113 --> 00:58:38.615
What bed?

634
00:58:38.682 --> 00:58:40.250
No, Zack.

635
00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:41.952
There's monsters under the bed.

636
00:58:42.019 --> 00:58:42.887
You can run but
you can't hide.


637
00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:50.461
How many times have I told you

638
00:58:50.528 --> 00:58:53.097
about locking the goddam
door in my house, huh?


639
00:58:55.432 --> 00:58:57.668
Oh, you're gonna
stand up to me now?


640
00:58:57.735 --> 00:58:58.903
Why don't you show me?

641
00:59:00.003 --> 00:59:02.038
Go ahead. Take your best shot.

642
00:59:06.210 --> 00:59:07.077
Pathetic.

643
00:59:08.077 --> 00:59:08.945
Both of ya.

644
00:59:23.193 --> 00:59:24.061
Zack.

645
00:59:43.213 --> 00:59:44.081
Zack.

646
01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:28.358
Son.

647
01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.150
She wants you.

648
01:01:27.918 --> 01:01:29.320
You're so sick.

649
01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:48.766
I'm not afraid.

650
01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:58.242
You're scared your
little friends can hear ya?


651
01:03:00.577 --> 01:03:02.179
You know why this happens?

652
01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:07.183
Because you're too weak
to do anything about it.


653
01:03:46.889 --> 01:03:48.258
Have you seen this?

654
01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:05.876
Don't tell me he
actually made it.


655
01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:09.912
I didn't hear
the back door open.


656
01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:10.847
Me neither.

657
01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:14.517
But...

658
01:04:18.854 --> 01:04:19.789
It's your turn.

659
01:04:22.726 --> 01:04:23.594
All right.

660
01:04:24.695 --> 01:04:27.698
Weird or not, let's do this.

661
01:04:36.472 --> 01:04:37.840
See you on the other side.

662
01:04:40.577 --> 01:04:41.445
Hey.

663
01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:48.485
Good luck, new fish.

664
01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:20.978
Hello, Chris.

665
01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:26.482
So many secrets, so much pain.

666
01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:30.720
How do you handle it?

667
01:06:31.987 --> 01:06:32.989
Handle what?

668
01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:53.942
I love you.

669
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:54.878
Me too.

670
01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:00.016
What's wrong?

671
01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:06.557
I wanna tell mom and dad.

672
01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:11.960
You're not having
second thoughts, right?


673
01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:13.096
No.

674
01:07:13.162 --> 01:07:14.431
No, I just...

675
01:07:15.898 --> 01:07:18.000
Can't we wait a little longer?

676
01:07:18.068 --> 01:07:19.036
What?

677
01:07:19.101 --> 01:07:20.304
Just until the
semester is over.


678
01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:23.773
We've got finals and that
big trip with my mom.


679
01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:27.110
She's gonna totally
flip when she finds out.


680
01:07:27.177 --> 01:07:28.111
She's gonna flip?

681
01:07:28.177 --> 01:07:29.978
My dad's gonna
ground me for life?


682
01:07:30.045 --> 01:07:31.480
He's probably gonna
make us get married.


683
01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:32.649
But you wanna do it?

684
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:35.652
After we graduate.

685
01:07:38.921 --> 01:07:40.690
Look, this isn't
just about you.


686
01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:43.059
We didn't plan this.

687
01:07:46.695 --> 01:07:48.964
It's happening and we
have to deal with it.


688
01:07:49.032 --> 01:07:51.167
Bat can we just deal with
it whenever the time is right?


689
01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:52.134
Now.

690
01:07:52.202 --> 01:07:53.069
Now is the right time.

691
01:07:53.135 --> 01:07:54.170
I'm already showing.

692
01:07:56.005 --> 01:07:57.407
What am I supposed to do?

693
01:07:58.641 --> 01:07:59.710
Just wear baggy clothes
and just tell people


694
01:07:59.777 --> 01:08:01.510
I'm gaining weight till
you feel comfortable


695
01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:02.244
to tell your mom?

696
01:08:02.311 --> 01:08:03.912
No.

697
01:08:03.979 --> 01:08:05.416
Can we talk about this?

698
01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:09.986
There's nothing to talk about?

699
01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:13.755
I have to tell them, and if
you can't support me then...


700
01:08:13.822 --> 01:08:15.224
Sarah.

701
01:08:15.291 --> 01:08:16.892
Sarah, I...

702
01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:17.828
I do...

703
01:08:50.894 --> 01:08:52.896
What did you fucking do?

704
01:11:02.191 --> 01:11:03.327
Christopher.

705
01:11:05.828 --> 01:11:06.829
Christopher.

706
01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:15.204
Christopher Michael.

707
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.979
Hey.

708
01:11:24.146 --> 01:11:25.782
Come, hold my hand.

709
01:11:50.105 --> 01:11:51.373
Listen, we don't have much time.

710
01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.775
We've gotta hurry.

711
01:11:53.877 --> 01:11:54.778
It's not over yet.

712
01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:57.046
I missed you so much.

713
01:11:58.782 --> 01:11:59.749
I missed you too.

714
01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:05.354
The way you got in is
the way you get out.


715
01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:06.923
What do you mean?

716
01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:07.890
Find the phone.

717
01:12:21.404 --> 01:12:22.272
I love you.

718
01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:24.240
Always.

719
01:12:29.444 --> 01:12:30.313
Now go.

720
01:12:31.346 --> 01:12:32.215
Go now.

721
01:12:33.115 --> 01:12:34.316
Find the phone.

722
01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:04.913
Brett.

723
01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:05.914
You're alive.

724
01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:07.048
What's happening?

725
01:13:07.115 --> 01:13:07.783
The phone.

726
01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:09.318
It's the only way out.

727
01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:10.987
I think I saw it this way.

728
01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:11.721
What are you talking about?

729
01:13:11.788 --> 01:13:12.856
The phone is right here.

730
01:13:16.993 --> 01:13:17.861
Brett.

731
01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:21.297
Brett.

732
01:14:00.904 --> 01:14:01.772
Tonya.

733
01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:37.340
Tonya.

734
01:17:41.256 --> 01:17:42.757
Everything ready?

735
01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:43.626
Yeah.

736
01:17:43.693 --> 01:17:44.694
They bought it.

737
01:17:44.761 --> 01:17:48.464
The contract, your
death, everything.


738
01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:49.664
Good.

739
01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:51.633
Two down, one to go.

740
01:17:53.402 --> 01:17:55.471
And once you take care
of the little slut,


741
01:17:56.672 --> 01:18:00.343
the money will be yours
just like I promised.


742
01:18:02.912 --> 01:18:03.780
Good boy.

743
01:18:33.376 --> 01:18:34.244
Tonya.

744
01:18:37.445 --> 01:18:38.113
I'm right here.

745
01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:43.552
Where is it, you bastard?

746
01:18:44.654 --> 01:18:46.188
Well, calm down.

747
01:18:46.255 --> 01:18:47.389
Where is the gun?

748
01:18:47.456 --> 01:18:49.757
The only gun I see is
the one you're holding.


749
01:18:49.824 --> 01:18:51.493
- Yeah, right.
- I came back for you.


750
01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.261
I don't know what
you're talking about.


751
01:18:53.328 --> 01:18:54.197
Don't move.

752
01:18:55.597 --> 01:18:58.501
I saw you and Edith on the TV.

753
01:18:59.569 --> 01:19:00.669
You saw her?

754
01:19:00.735 --> 01:19:01.604
Yes.

755
01:19:02.505 --> 01:19:04.206
On the TV?

756
01:19:04.273 --> 01:19:05.074
Yeah.

757
01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:06.641
And I know what you're planning.

758
01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:08.344
I swear. I don't know what...

759
01:19:15.217 --> 01:19:16.086
Put the gun down.

760
01:19:18.287 --> 01:19:19.688
You're right.

761
01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:22.423
You saw Edith, but
she's not alive.


762
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:25.627
She's something else.

763
01:19:27.395 --> 01:19:28.697
What?

764
01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:29.965
I know it sounds crazy.

765
01:19:30.032 --> 01:19:34.636
I know this all sounds
crazy, but there's no game.


766
01:19:35.438 --> 01:19:36.305
There's no money.

767
01:19:36.372 --> 01:19:37.706
The call.

768
01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:38.775
It's just a trap.

769
01:19:39.742 --> 01:19:41.310
It's just a trap.

770
01:19:41.377 --> 01:19:42.512
She tricked me.

771
01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:45.115
She tricked all of us.

772
01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:51.320
Where are Brett and Zack?

773
01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:56.359
They're dead.

774
01:20:01.396 --> 01:20:03.565
We've gotta get outta here.

775
01:20:15.778 --> 01:20:19.282
They were into some
really twisted stuff.


776
01:20:20.615 --> 01:20:24.554
When I made the call, it
was like I was transported.


777
01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:27.756
I don't understand.

778
01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:28.691
Where?

779
01:20:29.859 --> 01:20:33.296
Darkest reaches of my mind.

780
01:20:34.497 --> 01:20:35.931
I don't know.

781
01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:37.499
It's hard to explain.

782
01:20:40.435 --> 01:20:42.204
But what I saw there...

783
01:20:43.072 --> 01:20:44.573
But you're still here.

784
01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:45.475
You're alive.

785
01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:48.310
'cause I didn't give up.

786
01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:55.585
Maybe you should have.

787
01:21:03.626 --> 01:21:04.793
You all...

788
01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:14.337
You all took the only thing

789
01:21:15.438 --> 01:21:18.208
that I cared about
in this world.


790
01:21:22.545 --> 01:21:25.215
But we figured out a
way to stay in touch.


791
01:21:28.783 --> 01:21:29.786
The phone.

792
01:21:33.756 --> 01:21:35.725
Technology's a
wonderful thing.


793
01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:38.962
It can bring people together

794
01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:41.497
or it can tear 'em apart.

795
01:21:52.374 --> 01:21:53.008
Yes, dear.

796
01:21:55.845 --> 01:21:56.746
Yes, I know.

797
01:21:58.146 --> 01:21:59.649
The boy came back.

798
01:22:01.449 --> 01:22:02.484
It's a pity really?

799
01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:08.390
Yes, my love.

800
01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:12.961
She wants to talk to you.

801
01:22:13.028 --> 01:22:13.930
Fuck you.

802
01:22:17.533 --> 01:22:18.635
Get on the phone.

803
01:22:34.749 --> 01:22:36.886
We gotta get outta here.

804
01:22:38.421 --> 01:22:39.689
The door's open.

805
01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:04.579
Dammit.

806
01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:05.515
Dammit!

807
01:23:06.548 --> 01:23:08.015
There's an exit
in the call room.


808
01:23:08.082 --> 01:23:08.950
Go!

809
01:23:25.133 --> 01:23:26.002
Tonya.

810
01:23:27.703 --> 01:23:30.006
Tonya.

811
01:23:31.474 --> 01:23:32.874
No, please.

812
01:23:38.514 --> 01:23:39.382
Tonya.

813
01:23:46.889 --> 01:23:48.791
Leave me alone.

814
01:23:48.858 --> 01:23:50.124
No.

815
01:23:50.191 --> 01:23:52.694
You should have left me alone.

816
01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:55.565
But you couldn't, could you?

817
01:23:57.032 --> 01:24:00.536
Because you needed
someone to blame.


818
01:24:00.603 --> 01:24:01.970
Shut up.

819
01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:04.539
Shut up, you fucking witch.

820
01:24:04.606 --> 01:24:06.641
So innocent, so pretty.

821
01:24:18.988 --> 01:24:19.856
Laura.

822
01:24:20.788 --> 01:24:21.657
Sit down.

823
01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:26.862
A little birdie told me
today is someone's birthday.


824
01:24:26.929 --> 01:24:28.864
For your special day,

825
01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:30.599
I got you something special.

826
01:24:31.533 --> 01:24:32.402
What is it?

827
01:24:51.854 --> 01:24:52.521
Tonya.

828
01:24:56.624 --> 01:24:58.226
Why are we going this way?

829
01:24:58.293 --> 01:24:59.461
It's a shortcut.

830
01:25:00.596 --> 01:25:02.664
Did you see what
Mrs. Cranston gave me?


831
01:25:02.730 --> 01:25:03.932
She said I was special.

832
01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:10.939
Yeah. Everyone
thinks you're special.


833
01:25:11.006 --> 01:25:12.941
So special.

834
01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:17.778
Hey, give it back.

835
01:25:17.846 --> 01:25:18.647
No.

836
01:25:18.713 --> 01:25:19.649
I'll tell dad.

837
01:25:21.249 --> 01:25:22.751
Tonya.

838
01:25:22.818 --> 01:25:24.686
Daddy's little girl.

839
01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:26.956
I hate you.

840
01:25:28.356 --> 01:25:31.961
She was his favorite
and you couldn't stand it.


841
01:25:34.663 --> 01:25:36.466
Now I'm daddy's little girl.

842
01:26:09.931 --> 01:26:10.800
Hello, Tonya.

843
01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:20.008
When I saw you wearing the
necklace that I gave Laura,


844
01:26:20.074 --> 01:26:21.978
I knew she was dead,
and I knew it was you.


845
01:26:25.648 --> 01:26:29.585
When they told us she was
missing and I was blamed,


846
01:26:29.652 --> 01:26:31.752
I died inside.

847
01:26:31.819 --> 01:26:34.355
The demons, they swirled
around me and I joined them.


848
01:26:34.422 --> 01:26:35.356
And they took me down,

849
01:26:35.423 --> 01:26:36.358
and they took me down

850
01:26:36.425 --> 01:26:37.793
and they took me down.

851
01:26:39.094 --> 01:26:41.896
Until nothing was left in
me but hatred and rage.


852
01:26:41.963 --> 01:26:43.966
And you know what's
so interesting?


853
01:26:44.932 --> 01:26:46.667
You're in the same boat.

854
01:26:46.734 --> 01:26:48.670
You and your stupid
little friends,


855
01:26:48.737 --> 01:26:49.538
you're all gonna suffer,

856
01:26:49.605 --> 01:26:51.707
and you're gonna die violently

857
01:26:51.774 --> 01:26:53.109
with your own hatred
and your own rage.


858
01:26:55.944 --> 01:26:58.347
Please, leave me alone.

859
01:26:58.413 --> 01:26:59.747
Oh, you don't have to worry.

860
01:26:59.814 --> 01:27:01.550
You are very alone.

861
01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:05.787
There's a special place in
hell for you, little girl.


862
01:27:05.854 --> 01:27:07.088
Do you know what hell is?

863
01:27:07.155 --> 01:27:09.157
There's a special place for you,

864
01:27:09.224 --> 01:27:11.293
and it's not what
the good book says.


865
01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:13.327
It is not fire and brimstone.

866
01:27:13.395 --> 01:27:15.163
It's reliving your worst nightmares

867
01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:17.199
over and over and over.

868
01:28:35.010 --> 01:28:35.878
Tonya.

869
01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:39.180
Come play with me.

870
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:48.057
Tonya.

871
01:28:49.358 --> 01:28:50.960
Come play with me.

872
01:28:57.865 --> 01:29:01.069
I told you we'd be together forever.

873
01:29:15.216 --> 01:29:17.053
Tonya.

874
01:29:46.914 --> 01:29:48.050
Mrs. Cranston.

875
01:29:54.622 --> 01:29:55.856
What do you want?

876
01:29:55.923 --> 01:29:57.458
Vengeance.

877
01:29:57.525 --> 01:29:59.327
I'm sorry.

878
01:29:59.394 --> 01:30:01.128
I'm so sorry.

879
01:30:01.195 --> 01:30:04.065
You're not sorry about anything.

880
01:30:05.367 --> 01:30:07.369
Certainly not about me.

881
01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:08.403
My husband.

882
01:30:16.144 --> 01:30:18.079
You're in my world now.

883
01:30:26.087 --> 01:30:27.322
Christopher.

884
01:30:27.389 --> 01:30:28.523
Sarah.

885
01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:29.859
Why'd you leave me?

886
01:30:30.591 --> 01:30:31.258
Why?

887
01:30:33.127 --> 01:30:35.496
I was coming right back.

888
01:30:35.564 --> 01:30:36.432
Liar.

889
01:31:30.351 --> 01:31:31.820
Hello.
