1
00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:43.742
- So, Richard.
- Yeah?


2
00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:46.478
- Your profile picture
looked a little different,


3
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.479
I got to say.

4
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:49.314
- Oh, very good eye.

5
00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:50.616
Good eye, my lady.

6
00:00:50.618 --> 00:00:53.652
Yes, that picture is,
in fact, Nathan Fillion


7
00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:55.387
from television's "firefly,"

8
00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:57.256
but everyone's always
saying how we're doppelgangers


9
00:00:57.258 --> 00:00:59.725
and we look exactly alike,
so I just kind of let it ride.


10
00:00:59.727 --> 00:01:00.892
- People tell you that?
- Yeah.


11
00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:01.927
Yeah, my mom.

12
00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:02.995
- Anybody else?
- Nope.


13
00:01:02.997 --> 00:01:04.296
- Okay.

14
00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:05.397
Hi!
- Hi.


15
00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:06.732
How are you two tonight?
- Hi.


16
00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:08.467
- Are you the chef?
- I am the waitress.


17
00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:09.568
- Very cool.

18
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.537
- Yeah, so what can I get you?

19
00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:13.905
- I'll start?
- Sure.


20
00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.041
- I am gonna do
a white Russian to drink.


21
00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:17.042
You know what?

22
00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:18.610
Let's make it a double.

23
00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:21.880
Or do you do bottle service?
- Not really.


24
00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:24.650
- Okay, well, then I'll take
a triple white Russian,


25
00:01:24.652 --> 00:01:27.853
and I'm also gonna do
the eggplant Parmesan


26
00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:29.988
but with vodka sauce,
if I could.


27
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.590
Maybe an extra shot in there
or something.


28
00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:32.924
- Okay, thank you.
And for you?


29
00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:36.395
- I will have the, um...

30
00:01:36.397 --> 00:01:37.562
I'm gonna stick with the water

31
00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:38.697
and I will have two

32
00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:41.066
complimentary bread baskets,
please.


33
00:01:41.068 --> 00:01:42.567
Unless you wanted to, uh...

34
00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:43.835
- Oh, no, I'm all set.
- Make it three?


35
00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.737
- Okay, great.
Be right back.


36
00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:46.738
Both: Whoo!

37
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.040
Jinx.

38
00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:49.808
- Yep.

39
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.743
So I think your profile said

40
00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:53.445
you work in
the film industry, right?


41
00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:54.479
- It does say that.

42
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:55.647
- Yeah.
That's cool.


43
00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.648
- Yeah.
- That's interesting.


44
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.816
- I work at take two video.

45
00:01:57.818 --> 00:01:59.718
I'm the manager over there.
Yeah.


46
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.788
We are actually the last store
in the country


47
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.523
that still rents VHS tapes.

48
00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:07.326
- Cool.
- And you work with teeth?


49
00:02:07.328 --> 00:02:08.527
- I do.

50
00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:09.795
I am a orthodontist assistant.

51
00:02:09.797 --> 00:02:10.962
- Fascinating,
because I actually have


52
00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.631
a bit of an issue.

53
00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:15.067
I... I've had this weird thing
in my mouth for, like,


54
00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.636
18 months for so, and I think
it might be a popcorn kernel,


55
00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:19.438
but I haven't been to a movie
in, like, years.


56
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.839
- We're gonna do this?

57
00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:22.407
- It feels like a kernel,
but it could also be ham.


58
00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.942
It smells like ham.
- Yeah.


59
00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:24.943
- It does, right?
- Yeah.


60
00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:26.645
- So maybe it's ham.

61
00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:29.114
I ask because if it is ham
and it's hardened in there,


62
00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:31.083
at what point does it just
become a tooth


63
00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:33.685
and do I start treating it
like a tooth?


64
00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:23.034
- Hey, Karen, it's Kate.

65
00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.703
Hey.

66
00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:26.905
I am following up about fondue
night on the 12th.


67
00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:30.108
My place, 7:00.
What do you say?


68
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.510
Oh.

69
00:03:31.512 --> 00:03:32.844
Yeah, don't worry about it.

70
00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:35.013
We will do it another time.

71
00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:36.748
Megan!
Hey, it's Kate fields.


72
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.517
Hi.

73
00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.586
I saw that you're coming
to knitting club on Monday.


74
00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:43.088
Oh, really?

75
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.590
Oh, I thought you said you were
attending on Facebook.


76
00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:47.159
That's a bummer.

77
00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:49.895
Hey, I'm just calling to make
sure that you and Ellen


78
00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:51.797
actually read the book
for this week.


79
00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.065
Yeah, no, "great expectations"
isn't that great.


80
00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.868
Well, it doesn't matter.

81
00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.172
You want to just come hang out
or something?


82
00:04:00.174 --> 00:04:01.173
Totally get it.

83
00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:02.207
Soon.
Yeah.


84
00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.775
Totally.

85
00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:04.976
Bye.

86
00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:09.714
Hey!
Marco!


87
00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:11.183
Brian!
Hey, it's Kate.


88
00:04:11.185 --> 00:04:12.818
Yeah.

89
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.553
Hey, I'm just calling
to get a final headcount


90
00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:17.622
for the dinner party
next Friday.


91
00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:19.524
No problem.

92
00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:21.726
We'll do it another time.

93
00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:23.462
Okay.
Bye.


94
00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:28.900
Okay, but if you guys already
have plans, then don't...


95
00:04:28.902 --> 00:04:30.735
<i>- we'll cancel them!
Consider them canceled.</i>


96
00:04:31.904 --> 00:04:32.971
Both: Taco Tuesday,
taco Tuesday,


97
00:04:32.973 --> 00:04:34.706
taco Tuesday!

98
00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:36.775
- I don't understand
how you just do raw onions.


99
00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:37.843
- They're good for you.

100
00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:39.744
- Oh, hey!
Guys, I was thinking.


101
00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:42.647
For Saturday, what do you guys
think about either fondue


102
00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:44.749
or medieval times?

103
00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:46.985
- I can't do fondue, Kate.
I am lactose intolerant.


104
00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:48.820
- Yeah, and I'm
theme restaurant intolerant.


105
00:04:48.822 --> 00:04:50.188
- All right, no worries.

106
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.024
Just yelp said they're fun
for birthdays, so...


107
00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:54.092
- Mm.

108
00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:56.862
- You bitches forgot
my birthday!


109
00:04:56.864 --> 00:04:57.863
- What?
No.


110
00:04:57.865 --> 00:04:59.097
- Yeah!

111
00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:00.599
- Hey, does anybody
need a refill?


112
00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:01.600
Or, like,
maybe two new best friends?


113
00:05:01.602 --> 00:05:03.034
'Cause we are the worst.

114
00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:04.669
- No, no, no, no.
I, um, I didn't forget.


115
00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.972
I was going to surprise you,
so you ruined it.


116
00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:08.139
- Evie, what day is my birthday?

117
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.642
- Fri...

118
00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:11.843
- s...
Both: Saturday.


119
00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:12.911
- Fri
-Saturday?

120
00:05:12.913 --> 00:05:14.145
- I was saying, "for Saturday."

121
00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.748
I had something planned
for Saturday,


122
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.652
but I should just cancel it now
because classic Kate found out.


123
00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:21.953
- Good 'cause it's not
a big deal.


124
00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:23.522
- Kate fields.

125
00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:26.958
It's your 30th birthday!

126
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.094
- Yes, and I don't want to make
a big deal about it.


127
00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:30.762
- No, let's make a big deal.
Let's have a party!


128
00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:31.763
Yes, please!

129
00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:33.031
Please let us throw you a party.

130
00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:34.633
Please, please, please.
It's what I do.


131
00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:37.235
- Mm, no thank you,
but if you insist on going out,


132
00:05:37.237 --> 00:05:39.004
I'll break out this bad boy.

133
00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:41.006
Red lobster, baby!

134
00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:42.307
25 big ones,

135
00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:44.910
courtesy of aunt Meryl, who...

136
00:05:44.912 --> 00:05:46.545
<i>
- Oh, yeah.</i>

137
00:05:46.547 --> 00:05:47.812
- Is a freak.
Officially.


138
00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:49.114
- Wow.

139
00:05:49.116 --> 00:05:50.248
Well, I'll get excited
if there's that


140
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.650
cheesecake factory gift card
in here.


141
00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:53.051
- I think there is,
but I used it.


142
00:05:53.053 --> 00:05:54.553
- What is this?
It's from Lincoln high.


143
00:05:54.555 --> 00:05:56.054
- I don't know.
They probably want money.


144
00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:58.256
Are we old enough that schools
want money from us now?


145
00:05:58.258 --> 00:05:59.791
- I think you are, technically.
Yeah.


146
00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:01.059
- Oh, okay.

147
00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:03.295
That's how it's gonna be.

148
00:06:03.297 --> 00:06:05.697
- Shut the front door!

149
00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:06.698
Um...
- What?


150
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.699
Did I not graduate?

151
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:09.234
- No, okay, um...

152
00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:11.303
Do you remember in... i think it
was sophomore English


153
00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:12.837
when Mr. Robbins had us
write letters


154
00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.105
to our 30-year-old selves?

155
00:06:14.107 --> 00:06:15.674
- Vaguely.

156
00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:18.843
- Yeah, well, uh,
he actually mails them.


157
00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:20.111
- Oh, my god.
- Stop it.


158
00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:21.246
No!
Evie!


159
00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:22.314
Don't!
- Please read it.


160
00:06:22.316 --> 00:06:23.315
Kate.

161
00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:24.816
- Sit down.

162
00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:26.258
- Okay.
We're really doing this, huh?


163
00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:29.788
- "Dear 30-year-old Kate."

164
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.056
- Oh, wow.

165
00:06:31.058 --> 00:06:32.257
You dot your "I" s
with little stars.


166
00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:33.258
That's precious.

167
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.259
- "Hey, Kate.

168
00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:37.028
"Congrats on surviving till 30.

169
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.029
You go, girl!"

170
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:39.030
- "You go, girl"?

171
00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:40.599
- It was the early 2000s.

172
00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:42.133
And "you go, girl" is timeless.
Come on.


173
00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:43.668
- That's debatable.

174
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.737
"You will be
a super successful orthodontist


175
00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:47.839
with your own practice."

176
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:49.908
- Cool.
Teenage me's already 0 for 1.


177
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.010
- "There will be a little one
to take care of


178
00:06:52.012 --> 00:06:55.380
or at least a bun in the oven."

179
00:06:55.382 --> 00:06:57.082
- I don't even use my oven.

180
00:06:57.084 --> 00:06:58.750
Literally or metaphorically.

181
00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:01.086
- "You will have the greatest
guy in the world.


182
00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:04.756
"He'll be handsome and sweet
and funny.


183
00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:08.059
"I have no doubt you will have
the most incredible life.


184
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:10.261
I'll see you then."

185
00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:11.963
- Yeah, that last line
was pretty creepy.


186
00:07:13.367 --> 00:07:16.001
- "Enjoy your

187
00:07:16.003 --> 00:07:17.402
I'm sure it will be a night
to remember."


188
00:07:17.404 --> 00:07:19.070
See?
Look.


189
00:07:19.072 --> 00:07:21.172
Your 16-year-old self
wanted a party, so please.


190
00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:23.108
- Absolutely not.

191
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.276
In fact, I'm gonna go on record
right now and say that we're not


192
00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:28.279
doing anything for my birthday,
so you guys make other plans.


193
00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.948
Oh, there's a p.S.

194
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.318
"P.S. Ashley Driscoll
can eat shit."


195
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.220
Classy.
- Oh, Ashley Driscoll.


196
00:07:35.222 --> 00:07:36.921
- You know, on my first day
at Lincoln high,


197
00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:38.690
Ashley Driscoll told me
my bowl cut looked like


198
00:07:38.692 --> 00:07:40.959
a turtle was sitting on my head,

199
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:42.360
and then she threw lettuce
at me.


200
00:07:42.362 --> 00:07:44.162
- Well, you still have
a bowl cut,


201
00:07:44.164 --> 00:07:46.264
but it's an edgier bowl cut.

202
00:07:46.266 --> 00:07:47.666
- There's a bowl cut
in my heart.


203
00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:49.234
- She called me a theaturd.

204
00:07:49.236 --> 00:07:50.769
- What is that?

205
00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:53.438
- It's a combination
of the word "theater"


206
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.006
and the word "turd."

207
00:07:55.008 --> 00:07:58.309
- Yeah, she was a bitch,
but she dated Peter Finch.


208
00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.111
Peter Finch was so hot.

209
00:08:00.113 --> 00:08:01.746
Wow.

210
00:08:01.748 --> 00:08:03.314
- Oh, that's my ride.

211
00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.717
Did you still want us
to drop you off?


212
00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:07.118
- Yeah.
Yeah, I should go.


213
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.420
Todd hates it when I'm late.

214
00:08:08.422 --> 00:08:10.088
- All right.
Well, I'll see you guys later.


215
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.890
- I'll see you this weekend at
the party...


216
00:08:11.892 --> 00:08:13.858
Both: Party, party, party,
party, party, party.


217
00:08:15.696 --> 00:08:16.695
Yeah, I can't do it.

218
00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:18.229
- That was wet.
- Sorry.


219
00:08:21.233 --> 00:08:22.734
So I can throw you
a party, right?


220
00:08:22.736 --> 00:08:23.735
- Nope.

221
00:08:23.737 --> 00:08:26.071
- Got it.

222
00:08:26.073 --> 00:08:27.272
- Have fun with the dishes.

223
00:08:27.274 --> 00:08:28.773
- Our gift to you.

224
00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:43.221
<i>
- Hey, Kate.</i>

225
00:08:43.223 --> 00:08:44.389
<i>Congrats on surviving till 30.</i>

226
00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:46.057
<i>You go, girl.</i>

227
00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:48.293
<i>You will be
a super successful orthodontist</i>


228
00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:50.028
<i>with your own practice.</i>

229
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.896
<i>There will be a little one
to take care of</i>


230
00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:54.966
<i>or at least a bun in the oven.</i>

231
00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:56.868
<i>You'll have the greatest guy
in the world.</i>


232
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.237
<i>He'll be handsome and sweet
and funny.</i>


233
00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:01.873
<i>You will have the most
incredible life.</i>


234
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.374
<i>I'll see you then.</i>

235
00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:11.783
- Excuse me.

236
00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:14.753
- Thank you.
My card wasn't working.


237
00:09:14.755 --> 00:09:15.920
- Oh, I'm sorry.

238
00:09:15.922 --> 00:09:18.022
I can't let you
into the building.


239
00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:19.190
- What?

240
00:09:19.192 --> 00:09:20.191
- I have no proof
that you work here.


241
00:09:20.193 --> 00:09:21.526
- No, I have a card.

242
00:09:21.528 --> 00:09:24.195
- But it doesn't work,
so could be a fake.


243
00:09:24.197 --> 00:09:25.396
I'm sorry.

244
00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.332
- Are you Ashley Driscoll?
- Yes.


245
00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:28.967
If you want to schedule
an appointment,


246
00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:30.034
you can call my office.

247
00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:32.036
- No, um, it's Kate fields.

248
00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:35.206
From Lincoln high.

249
00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:38.009
Braceface.

250
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:39.110
- Braceface!

251
00:09:39.112 --> 00:09:40.979
- Oh, my god!
Look at you.


252
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:43.882
You look, you know,
so much older.


253
00:09:43.884 --> 00:09:45.884
- Thanks.

254
00:09:45.886 --> 00:09:47.385
I did not know you worked
in the building.


255
00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:49.020
- Yeah.

256
00:09:49.022 --> 00:09:51.156
My real estate business
got too big for my old office,


257
00:09:51.158 --> 00:09:53.091
so now I have
the whole top floor.


258
00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:54.859
I feel like Oprah.

259
00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:56.161
- Whole floor?
- Mm-hmm.


260
00:09:56.163 --> 00:09:57.262
- Cool.

261
00:09:57.264 --> 00:09:58.429
- Anyway,
it was good to see you.


262
00:09:58.431 --> 00:09:59.464
- You too.

263
00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:00.965
- Oh, I'm sorry.

264
00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:03.034
I still can't let you
in the building.


265
00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:04.035
- Are you serious?

266
00:10:04.037 --> 00:10:05.103
- It's building policy.

267
00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.371
You have to have a working card.

268
00:10:06.373 --> 00:10:08.039
It opens in 20 minutes though.

269
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:09.474
Anyway, it was really good
to see you.


270
00:10:09.476 --> 00:10:11.009
Don't be a stranger.

271
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:12.076
Bye!

272
00:10:22.055 --> 00:10:25.023
- So how did the date go?

273
00:10:26.526 --> 00:10:28.993
Kate?

274
00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:30.161
Kate.
Hey.


275
00:10:30.163 --> 00:10:32.831
How was your date
the other night?


276
00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:34.465
<i>- It's just that usually
there's a kid's menu.</i>


277
00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.167
- Kate.

278
00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:38.002
- Can't do crunchy stuff
'cause of the ham tooth.


279
00:10:38.004 --> 00:10:39.470
- Yeah.
Ham tooth.


280
00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.606
- Sop it down.
Get it soggy.


281
00:10:41.608 --> 00:10:43.374
- Oh, well, that's a...
That's a interesting ring


282
00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:44.542
you have there.

283
00:10:44.544 --> 00:10:46.077
- Oh, very perceptive of you,
my lady.


284
00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:47.078
Very good.

285
00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.180
Um, on the weekends, I go goth.

286
00:10:49.182 --> 00:10:51.516
- I'm sorry?
- On the weekends, I go goth.


287
00:10:51.518 --> 00:10:52.617
- Goth.
- Goth.


288
00:10:52.619 --> 00:10:54.018
- Goth?
- I go goth.


289
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.386
- People still go goth?

290
00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:56.387
- Oh, yeah.
- Really?


291
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:57.889
- Yeah.

292
00:10:57.891 --> 00:10:59.157
I host a rave
in my mom's basement, like,


293
00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:00.425
every second Saturday.

294
00:11:00.427 --> 00:11:02.126
Full goth.
Full goth.


295
00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:03.928
Yeah.

296
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.331
I know that Richard
may seem to be milquetoast


297
00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:08.900
and boring and plain,
but on the weekends,


298
00:11:08.902 --> 00:11:13.271
he hatches into raven.

299
00:11:13.273 --> 00:11:14.272
- Raven.

300
00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:15.473
Raven.

301
00:11:15.475 --> 00:11:17.408
- Raven?
- A little more roundness to it.


302
00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.610
Should feel like, "raven."

303
00:11:18.612 --> 00:11:19.611
Raven.

304
00:11:19.613 --> 00:11:21.112
- Little bit more bass in there.

305
00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:22.313
- That's as low as I can go.
- Okay.


306
00:11:22.315 --> 00:11:23.448
- Okay.

307
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.883
- Is that gonna be a problem
for you?


308
00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:26.084
- No.

309
00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:27.218
- Well,
because that is my social life,


310
00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.219
and a lot of people
get intimidated


311
00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:29.220
because it's so cool...

312
00:11:29.222 --> 00:11:30.989
- Oh, god, no.
- Great!


313
00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:32.924
Because this is going
fabulously, so if you're okay...


314
00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:33.925
- okay, no.
Richard, really quick...


315
00:11:33.927 --> 00:11:35.159
- yeah?
Raven.


316
00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:36.594
- Okay, I'm sorry, raven.
- Yeah.


317
00:11:36.596 --> 00:11:38.129
My ex-boyfriend just walked
through the door.


318
00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:39.597
- Oh.
- Yeah.


319
00:11:39.599 --> 00:11:40.932
So I'm just gonna excuse myself.
- Say no more.


320
00:11:40.934 --> 00:11:42.200
You want to make him
really jealous.


321
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:43.301
- No, that's not at all
what I want.


322
00:11:43.303 --> 00:11:44.402
- Coming in to touch
the shoulder.


323
00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:45.470
- Nope.
- Touch the shoulder.


324
00:11:45.472 --> 00:11:46.471
- Nope.
- Permission to touch...


325
00:11:46.473 --> 00:11:47.472
- Nope.
- Okay, wow.


326
00:11:47.474 --> 00:11:49.007
Whoa, saucy lady.

327
00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:50.375
Oh, you really
want to make him jealous.


328
00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:51.409
It's our anniversary.

329
00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:53.044
Not a big deal.

330
00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:54.045
Hey, listen.
Kate?


331
00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:55.146
I think he's gone.

332
00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:56.147
He took her to the patio, so...

333
00:11:56.149 --> 00:11:57.148
- What?
- Hi.


334
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.950
- Hi.

335
00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:00.385
- He took her to the patio,
so I think you're in the clear.


336
00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:01.386
- He's gone?
- Yeah.


337
00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:02.388
- Are you sure?
- Whoa.


338
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.522
That was awesome!

339
00:12:04.524 --> 00:12:06.357
Look, so, uh...

340
00:12:06.359 --> 00:12:09.060
I don't feel like I really get
along with most people in life.


341
00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.061
- Really?
- Yeah.


342
00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:11.162
- Wow.

343
00:12:11.164 --> 00:12:12.563
- But the thing is,
I do feel like


344
00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.399
you and I are on the exact...

345
00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:17.702
Same exact wavelength, so...

346
00:12:17.704 --> 00:12:19.370
Congratulations.

347
00:12:19.372 --> 00:12:20.371
You're getting another date.

348
00:12:20.373 --> 00:12:22.073
- Nope.
That...


349
00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:23.995
You're supposed to ask me
if I want another date.


350
00:12:25.178 --> 00:12:27.078
You don't just tell me,
you know?


351
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.714
- Mm, my litmus test is like,
"what would Nathan Fillion do?"


352
00:12:29.716 --> 00:12:32.617
And would Nathan Fillion
ask politely, or would he say...


353
00:12:32.619 --> 00:12:33.985
- you know what?

354
00:12:33.987 --> 00:12:35.320
I think he would.
- Would he?


355
00:12:35.322 --> 00:12:37.088
- Yeah, he seems like
a really nice guy.


356
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.489
- Look, I don't know.
I'm just his doppelganger, so...


357
00:12:38.491 --> 00:12:39.490
- uh, debatable.

358
00:12:39.492 --> 00:12:40.658
- Fridays are no good for me

359
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.060
because those
are my falconry Fridays


360
00:12:42.062 --> 00:12:43.227
where I play with my falcons.

361
00:12:43.229 --> 00:12:45.496
Saturday is d, d&d Saturday.

362
00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:47.131
The third d, of course, for...

363
00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:48.132
- Drinking?
- Domino's.


364
00:12:48.134 --> 00:12:49.701
- Got it.

365
00:12:49.703 --> 00:12:51.636
- Every single Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, however,


366
00:12:51.638 --> 00:12:53.271
until 2019, wide open.

367
00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:54.472
- Happy birthday.

368
00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:55.707
- Thank you.

369
00:12:55.709 --> 00:12:58.376
Thank you, chef.

370
00:12:58.378 --> 00:12:59.577
I like to tell them

371
00:12:59.579 --> 00:13:01.479
it's my birthday
for the free cake.


372
00:13:02.549 --> 00:13:04.182
<i>
- Gauze.</i>

373
00:13:04.184 --> 00:13:05.216
Kate.
- Hmm?


374
00:13:05.218 --> 00:13:07.118
- Gauze.
- Oh.


375
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.220
- You almost choked on
your own blood, but don't worry.


376
00:13:09.222 --> 00:13:11.289
We got you.

377
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:12.423
Sorry.

378
00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:23.468
- Sparkling grape juice
just in case there's a miracle


379
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:24.535
brewing in there.

380
00:13:25.572 --> 00:13:27.238
- Todd, I'm proud of you.

381
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.574
As of today, Todd was promoted
to vice president


382
00:13:29.576 --> 00:13:31.743
of paralegal management
at Jones and associates.


383
00:13:31.745 --> 00:13:33.011
All right.

384
00:13:33.013 --> 00:13:34.445
- Hear, hear!
All: Hear.


385
00:13:36.016 --> 00:13:37.056
- Oh, that's real crystal.

386
00:13:38.018 --> 00:13:39.650
- Mmm.
Mm!


387
00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.519
I have an idea.

388
00:13:41.521 --> 00:13:44.422
Why don't we all head up to
the mountain house this weekend


389
00:13:44.424 --> 00:13:46.090
to do some celebratory skiing?

390
00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:47.625
- Yes.

391
00:13:47.627 --> 00:13:50.795
Yes, I've been wanting to break
out my new Fischer XCS.


392
00:13:50.797 --> 00:13:53.031
Hunter at work is so jealous.

393
00:13:53.033 --> 00:13:55.099
I can't wait to test
those puppies out on the powder.


394
00:13:55.101 --> 00:13:59.170
- Babe, it's Kate's birthday
this weekend.


395
00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:01.706
- Evie, how often do I get
a promotion?


396
00:14:01.708 --> 00:14:04.275
- Every six months.
It's your dad's company.


397
00:14:04.277 --> 00:14:07.211
- Exactly, so just try to be
a little bit more considerate.


398
00:14:12.285 --> 00:14:16.587
- So, Evie, how is
the fundraising coming along?


399
00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:19.824
You know, for the bald...
Llamas?


400
00:14:19.826 --> 00:14:22.693
- Alpacas with alopecia.

401
00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:24.262
- Oh, is... is that a thing?

402
00:14:24.264 --> 00:14:25.730
- Yeah, apparently.

403
00:14:25.732 --> 00:14:28.633
Yeah, I had no idea either,
but they called me.


404
00:14:28.635 --> 00:14:34.105
And, actually, I have already
raised over half of their goal.


405
00:14:34.107 --> 00:14:36.207
Hear, hear.

406
00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:37.708
- Well, I think
it's very important


407
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.710
for housewives
to keep their hobbies.


408
00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:41.212
- Oh, it pays.

409
00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:43.681
Because it's my job, so it pays.

410
00:14:47.087 --> 00:14:48.786
- Oh.

411
00:14:48.788 --> 00:14:50.154
- Lay off, mom.

412
00:14:50.156 --> 00:14:51.589
Okay?

413
00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:53.791
If Evie wants to make
a little extra spending money,


414
00:14:53.793 --> 00:14:55.793
who am I to stop her?

415
00:14:55.795 --> 00:14:56.828
Even though I've offered.

416
00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:10.475
<i>Male announcer: So grab
a friend and make some plans.</i>


417
00:15:10.477 --> 00:15:12.210
<i>Cabins are filling up fast.</i>

418
00:15:12.212 --> 00:15:14.412
<i>Michiana, exit 212.</i>

419

00:15:18.518 --> 00:15:19.617
- Oh, my god.

00:15:19.619 --> 00:15:21.652
<i>

423

- Throw me a party.

00:15:37.537 --> 00:15:39.504
- Seriously?
- Yep.


431
00:15:39.506 --> 00:15:41.139
Let's check one thing
off that letter.


432
00:15:41.141 --> 00:15:41.906
Throw me a damn party.

433
00:15:41.908 --> 00:15:43.174
- I'll make t-shirts!

434
00:15:43.176 --> 00:15:45.343
- No, no.
Nothing crazy.


435
00:15:45.345 --> 00:15:47.445
Let's keep it super casual.

436
00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:50.648
Evie, do you even have time
to throw this so last minute?


437
00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:51.682
Evie?

438
00:15:51.684 --> 00:15:52.917
<i>Evie?</i>

439
00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:54.185
- Sorry, I blacked out
from excitement.


440
00:15:54.187 --> 00:15:55.853
Kate, of course!

441
00:15:55.855 --> 00:15:57.688
I once put together the Alpha
sigma tiki mixer in two hours


442
00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.390
complete with a full
roasted pig.


443
00:15:59.392 --> 00:16:02.460
- All right, well, seriously,
keep it very small.


444
00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:04.262
Classy, even,

445
00:16:04.264 --> 00:16:05.696
and Charlie, I'm counting on you
to keep Evie in line.


446
00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:06.797
- Never do.
- <i>Okay.</i>


447
00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.199
Cool.

448
00:16:08.201 --> 00:16:09.500
I will put it in my calendar.

449
00:16:09.502 --> 00:16:10.768
This is gonna be really fun.

450
00:16:11.938 --> 00:16:13.738
- I think I just found us
a venue.


451
00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:20.478
- Go team!

452
00:16:30.622 --> 00:16:31.622
Morning, sunshine.

453
00:16:31.624 --> 00:16:32.924
- Mm.
Morning.


454
00:16:32.926 --> 00:16:35.593
- Looks like one of us
had some fun last night.


455
00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:37.762
You got a pair of panties
in your front pocket.


456
00:16:37.764 --> 00:16:39.197
- Oh, they're my spare pair.

457
00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:40.731
Okay.

458
00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:42.633
We are starting off
fixing a snapped wire


459
00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:45.369
on a permanent retainer,
then there's an extraction


460
00:16:45.371 --> 00:16:46.571
of Kelly Grossman's back molar.

461
00:16:46.573 --> 00:16:48.239
I know.

462
00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:52.343
Two braces checkups
and retainer fitting finale.


463
00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:53.945
What?

464
00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:56.547
You look like the Grinch.
What?


465
00:16:56.549 --> 00:16:58.516
- Dan is our first client.

466
00:16:59.786 --> 00:17:01.986
- And?
- Well, he's cute.


467
00:17:01.988 --> 00:17:04.322
I think you should invite him
to your party.


468
00:17:04.324 --> 00:17:05.790
- I can't invite a patient
to my party.


469
00:17:05.792 --> 00:17:07.625
- Why not?

470
00:17:07.627 --> 00:17:09.460
- Uh, because one of us has to
keep a level of professionalism


471
00:17:09.462 --> 00:17:10.461
around here.

472
00:17:10.463 --> 00:17:11.662
- Oh, come on.

473
00:17:11.664 --> 00:17:13.231
It's one pair of panties.

474
00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:14.599
These are not my panties.

475
00:17:16.936 --> 00:17:18.369
- So, Dan, are you
still a little nervous


476
00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:19.637
when it comes to
the dental stuff?


477
00:17:19.639 --> 00:17:21.372
- Oh, no.

478
00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:23.441
I think you're confusing me
with somebody else.


479
00:17:23.443 --> 00:17:25.943
- Okay, well, I'm gonna need
my arm back to work.


480
00:17:25.945 --> 00:17:27.311
- Oh.

481
00:17:27.313 --> 00:17:29.480
- It's okay.
- Okay, Dan.


482
00:17:29.482 --> 00:17:31.782
So it says here
that we are giving you


483
00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:35.586
a new front grille that says
"ass" and "shaker."


484
00:17:35.588 --> 00:17:36.854
- Oh, no.
I, uh...


485
00:17:36.856 --> 00:17:38.456
- I'm just kidding.

486
00:17:38.458 --> 00:17:40.291
I'm fixing the wire
on that broken retainer.


487
00:17:40.293 --> 00:17:41.859
- Right.
- Relax.


488
00:17:41.861 --> 00:17:44.362
- All right, I've got good news
and bad news for you.


489
00:17:44.364 --> 00:17:46.697
The good news is that
this is not gonna hurt at all,


490
00:17:46.699 --> 00:17:48.366
so you don't even need
an anesthetic,


491
00:17:48.368 --> 00:17:51.369
but the bad news is that
Jules has no medical moral code,


492
00:17:51.371 --> 00:17:52.903
so she's gonna let me
gas you up.


493
00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:54.305
- Yeah, let's party.

494
00:17:54.307 --> 00:17:55.573
- All right.
Take a deep breath.


495
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.443
Good.

496
00:17:59.445 --> 00:18:00.945
Thank you.

497
00:18:00.947 --> 00:18:02.747
Yeah, I don't know why I got
so nervous there.


498
00:18:03.783 --> 00:18:05.483
I mean, normally
I'm extremely macho and tough.


499
00:18:05.485 --> 00:18:06.717
- Mm.

500
00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.853
No, but seriously.

501
00:18:08.855 --> 00:18:09.854
I'm not even afraid of spiders.

502
00:18:09.856 --> 00:18:11.522
- Hm.
Wow.


503
00:18:11.524 --> 00:18:14.425
- I mean, snakes, however,
they can suck a duck.


504
00:18:16.795 --> 00:18:20.064
- I'm sorry,
that was not very chivalrous.


505
00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:23.801
Chivalrous.
That's a funny word.


506
00:18:23.803 --> 00:18:25.403
Chivalrous.

507
00:18:25.405 --> 00:18:27.038
- Maybe I should use
that nitrous as my plus one


508
00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.639
to your birthday.

509
00:18:28.641 --> 00:18:30.281
- I don't know.
I heard he's pretty gassy.


510
00:18:31.744 --> 00:18:35.012
- Oh, you found your audience.

511
00:18:35.014 --> 00:18:36.914
- It's your birthday?

512
00:18:36.916 --> 00:18:38.316
Happy birthday!

513
00:18:38.318 --> 00:18:39.784
- Thank you.

514
00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:42.420
- Oh, you should come
to her birthday tomorrow.


515
00:18:42.422 --> 00:18:44.822
- Oh, I would love to!

516
00:18:44.824 --> 00:18:46.857
Wait, how do I get there?

517
00:18:47.993 --> 00:18:49.493
- Do you have a car?

518
00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:51.095
- I do!

519
00:18:51.097 --> 00:18:53.631
I can drive there.

520
00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:54.665
- You are a drug dealer.

521
00:18:54.667 --> 00:18:55.866
- Yeah, I know.

522
00:18:55.868 --> 00:18:57.935
Gassy.

523
00:19:00.006 --> 00:19:01.405
- Evie, let's go!

524
00:19:01.407 --> 00:19:03.074
You can put your face on
in the car.


525
00:19:09.882 --> 00:19:11.549
- Oh.
Sorry, guys.


526
00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:12.550
It's work drama.

527
00:19:12.552 --> 00:19:14.118
Hey, Linda.

528
00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.820
<i>Just about to roll out for
the weekend with the family.</i>


529
00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:17.788
What's up?

530
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.758
Whoa, Linda, I can't understand
you when you're talking so fast.


531
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.963
Oh, my god.

532
00:19:25.965 --> 00:19:27.031
Oh, my god!

533
00:19:28.968 --> 00:19:30.668
He's gonna be okay, right?

534
00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.471
What do you mean
you can't find him?


535
00:19:34.773 --> 00:19:35.806
- Oh, I get it.
We're lying.


536
00:19:35.808 --> 00:19:37.007
- Yes!

537
00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:38.509
Of course!
I will be right there.


538
00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:39.944
Yes, I will be there in person.

539
00:19:39.946 --> 00:19:41.445
- Yeah, big old lie.
Cool.


540
00:19:41.447 --> 00:19:42.880
Sounds fun.
- Okay.


541
00:19:47.085 --> 00:19:48.753
Oh, my god.

542
00:19:48.755 --> 00:19:50.588
I'm... I'm so sorry, you guys.

543
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.089
I can't go.

544
00:19:52.091 --> 00:19:54.792
Elliot is missing.

545
00:19:54.794 --> 00:19:56.160
- Who's Elliot?

546
00:19:56.162 --> 00:19:59.663
- He's the face
of the alopecia campaign.


547
00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:01.098
- So he's a llama?

548
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.000
- No, Todd, he's an alpaca.

549
00:20:03.002 --> 00:20:04.702
Look, I am so sorry.

550
00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:07.772
I was really looking forward
to going cross-country skiing


551
00:20:07.774 --> 00:20:10.608
with the skis and the knees.

552
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:11.776
- It's okay, honey.

553
00:20:11.778 --> 00:20:13.477
I'll just cancel
the private lesson


554
00:20:13.479 --> 00:20:15.913
I set up for you
with the bronze medalist.


555
00:20:15.915 --> 00:20:19.617
Let me just make sure I can
cancel his flight from Norway.


556
00:20:19.619 --> 00:20:22.853
Airlines are so great
to deal with.


557
00:20:26.091 --> 00:20:28.459
I knew this was gonna happen.

558
00:20:28.461 --> 00:20:30.461
I just had the sense
that she would...


559
00:20:30.463 --> 00:20:31.962
- are you seriously
not gonna come?


560
00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:33.531
- Work needs me.

561
00:20:34.534 --> 00:20:36.434
- What?
What is that?


562
00:20:36.436 --> 00:20:39.170
- It's just I want a wife
who will celebrate my victories


563
00:20:39.172 --> 00:20:42.206
with me, but instead I have one
who's running all over town


564
00:20:42.208 --> 00:20:44.909
looking for a loose llama.

565
00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:46.043
- Alpaca.

566
00:20:46.045 --> 00:20:48.112
- Sh-paca.

567
00:20:48.114 --> 00:20:49.780
Just give me a kiss
so my parents don't think


568
00:20:49.782 --> 00:20:50.848
that we're fighting.

569
00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:01.759
Behave yourself.

570
00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:14.638
No, no, no, no.

571
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.707
Those jell-o shots,
they go in the kitchen.


572
00:21:16.709 --> 00:21:19.043
And the kegs,
they go in the man cave.


573
00:21:19.045 --> 00:21:22.179
And that... that liquor luge,
just wherever it fits!


574
00:21:23.182 --> 00:21:24.248
- Hi.

575
00:21:26.117 --> 00:21:27.485
- Oh.

576
00:21:27.487 --> 00:21:28.586
Hello.

577
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:31.222
Are you selling
girl scout cookies?


578
00:21:31.224 --> 00:21:33.991
- No, I bring in the mail
for the Jones


579
00:21:33.993 --> 00:21:34.992
when they're out of town, so...

580
00:21:34.994 --> 00:21:37.127
- Oh, cool.
Cool.


581
00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:39.697
Well, I'm their son's wife,
Evie.


582
00:21:39.699 --> 00:21:40.965
Nice to meet you.

583
00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:42.666
I'm gonna be staying here
this weekend.


584
00:21:42.668 --> 00:21:44.134
- Cool.

585
00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:46.203
- Yeah, just throwing a little
get together for a friend.


586
00:21:46.205 --> 00:21:48.506
30-year-old birthday party.

587
00:21:48.508 --> 00:21:49.940
You wouldn't know anything
about that, right?


588
00:21:49.942 --> 00:21:51.575
You're what, college?
- High... high school.


589
00:21:51.577 --> 00:21:52.643
- High school.
High school.


590
00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:53.777
- High school.
- Mm-hmm.


591
00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:55.179
Cool.
Well, it's very low-key.


592
00:21:55.181 --> 00:21:56.580
You know, small.

593
00:21:56.582 --> 00:21:58.682
Nothing that the Jones
would need to know


594
00:21:58.684 --> 00:22:00.951
or be worried about, so...

595
00:22:00.953 --> 00:22:02.186
- Cool.

596
00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:05.856
- Okay, you can invite
two friends


597
00:22:05.858 --> 00:22:08.626
if you don't say anything
about it.


598
00:22:08.628 --> 00:22:10.194
- I don't know
if I'd have two friends...


599
00:22:10.196 --> 00:22:11.762
- five.
Five friends, but that's it.


600
00:22:11.764 --> 00:22:14.231
And it doesn't leave this house.
You got it?


601
00:22:14.233 --> 00:22:15.299
- What just happened?

602
00:22:15.301 --> 00:22:17.001
- Exactly.

603
00:22:17.003 --> 00:22:19.537
Yes.

604
00:22:19.539 --> 00:22:20.738
- Do you still want me to...

605
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.072
- yes, thank you.
Right there is great.


606
00:22:22.074 --> 00:22:24.642
And can I get six jell-o shots
upstairs please?


607
00:22:24.644 --> 00:22:25.976
Just orange.

608
00:22:28.848 --> 00:22:31.115
- I stayed up all night
doing these.


609
00:22:31.117 --> 00:22:32.750
- Yeah, I know.

610
00:22:32.752 --> 00:22:35.619
That's why I'm paying you
time and a half.


611
00:22:35.621 --> 00:22:38.255
- Rufus, what the hell?

612
00:22:38.257 --> 00:22:39.690
- "Partee tyme."

613
00:22:42.728 --> 00:22:45.129
- I'm, like, 70% sure that's not
how you spell "party" or "time."


614
00:22:45.131 --> 00:22:48.232
- Okay, I just thought, like,
"hey, who wants to wear a shirt


615
00:22:48.234 --> 00:22:50.034
that's spelled correctly,"
you know?


616
00:22:50.036 --> 00:22:52.102
We live in the digital age.

617
00:22:52.104 --> 00:22:55.573
Spelling is, like, subjective.

618
00:22:55.575 --> 00:22:56.575
You know?

619
00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:00.144
Okay, I did these last night

620
00:23:00.146 --> 00:23:01.245
after a guidance counselors
show.


621
00:23:01.247 --> 00:23:02.713
I was super drunk.

622
00:23:02.715 --> 00:23:04.582
- Dude, can't keep messing up
like this.


623
00:23:04.584 --> 00:23:05.883
I mean, remember last week

624
00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:07.585
with the all saints softball
shirts you ruined?


625
00:23:07.587 --> 00:23:10.888
I changed my band name
to the all taints.


626
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.756
We sold out!

627
00:23:12.758 --> 00:23:15.159
- I know, it's an awesome shirt,
but that's not the point.


628
00:23:15.161 --> 00:23:17.695
You know, this business,
this is my passion.


629
00:23:17.697 --> 00:23:19.697
I just need to know that, like,
you're in my corner.


630
00:23:19.699 --> 00:23:20.931
- I am in your corner.

631
00:23:20.933 --> 00:23:22.666
Any corner.
Pick a corner.


632
00:23:22.668 --> 00:23:24.134
I'm in that corner.

633
00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:26.604
- It's in three hours!
Are you kidding me?


634
00:23:26.606 --> 00:23:28.005
Ugh, fine.

635
00:23:28.007 --> 00:23:30.107
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.


636
00:23:30.109 --> 00:23:31.875
I know that Kate
wanted some classy stuff,


637
00:23:31.877 --> 00:23:34.612
so I ordered one of those naked
Sushi girls for the party.


638
00:23:34.614 --> 00:23:36.113
- I'm still waiting
on the classy part.


639
00:23:36.115 --> 00:23:37.615
- But she canceled just now.

640
00:23:38.618 --> 00:23:40.017
Ah.
Hi.


641
00:23:40.019 --> 00:23:41.318
- Hey, lady.

642
00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.220
I'm headed your way.

643
00:23:43.222 --> 00:23:44.355
<i>- On your way?
It's, like, 6:00.</i>


644
00:23:44.357 --> 00:23:45.990
<i>What are you, in seventh grade?</i>

645
00:23:45.992 --> 00:23:47.358
- Well, I don't know.
I thought I could help.


646
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.993
- What?
No, no, no, no, no, no.


647
00:23:48.995 --> 00:23:50.694
We have everything
under control.


648
00:23:50.696 --> 00:23:52.062
- Okay, well, I'm gonna grab
a coffee.


649
00:23:52.064 --> 00:23:53.230
Do you want me
to pick anything up?


650
00:23:53.232 --> 00:23:54.898
- I don't know.
Milk?


651
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.367
- You didn't get milk
for my white Russian?


652
00:23:56.369 --> 00:23:58.068
<i>- I forgot to put that
on the catering list.</i>


653
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:59.303
- Caterers?

654
00:23:59.305 --> 00:24:00.871
Evie, this is supposed
to be small.


655
00:24:00.873 --> 00:24:02.172
- It's gonna be!
<i>Very small.</i>


656
00:24:02.174 --> 00:24:04.174
Small food, small drinks,
small caterers.


657
00:24:04.176 --> 00:24:06.310
<i>This party is gonna be so small
that you'll hardly see it.</i>


658
00:24:06.312 --> 00:24:07.711
- Okay, well, I'm headed over.

659
00:24:07.713 --> 00:24:09.680
- Great!

660
00:24:09.682 --> 00:24:10.948
Okay, people, double time!

661
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.750
Red eagle lands in one hour!

662
00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:21.392
- Looking good, ash.

663
00:24:21.394 --> 00:24:23.027
- Hey.

664
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:24.695
Could you get me something
to eat?


665
00:24:24.697 --> 00:24:25.763
- Yeah, of course.

666
00:24:25.765 --> 00:24:27.264
What do you want?
- Great.


667
00:24:27.266 --> 00:24:30.067
Let me get a cup of coffee
and then barbecue lay's,


668
00:24:30.069 --> 00:24:32.403
and then, like, a apple,
and then something savory,


669
00:24:32.405 --> 00:24:34.338
but you can choose.

670
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.706
- Anything else?

671
00:24:35.708 --> 00:24:37.241
- Two crullers,
a pack of cigars,


672
00:24:37.243 --> 00:24:39.777
maybe, like, a king size
whatchamacallit bar,


673
00:24:39.779 --> 00:24:43.180
some gummy bears, and then...

674
00:24:43.182 --> 00:24:44.915
Get yourself something.

675
00:25:10.709 --> 00:25:12.009
That's stupid.

676
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:53.450
Oh, my god.

677
00:26:00.159 --> 00:26:01.291
It's actually happening!

678
00:26:01.293 --> 00:26:03.160
- What's happening?

679
00:26:03.162 --> 00:26:06.196
Hey, what the heck are you doing
with a picture of my girlfriend


680
00:26:06.198 --> 00:26:07.197
on your computer?

681
00:26:07.199 --> 00:26:08.799
- Mom!

682
00:26:08.801 --> 00:26:10.200
- Oh, widdle baby
wants to talk to his mom.


683
00:26:10.202 --> 00:26:11.869
Tough luck 'cause she just left

684
00:26:11.871 --> 00:26:13.470
to buy me some more
push-up pops.


685
00:26:13.472 --> 00:26:16.039
What is the deal
with this party?


686
00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:17.775
My invite must've got lost
in the mail.


687
00:26:17.777 --> 00:26:19.109
- It's an email, so...

688
00:26:19.111 --> 00:26:20.444
- I don't think mom
would approve of you


689
00:26:20.446 --> 00:26:23.213
going to a party with alcohol,
would she?


690
00:26:23.215 --> 00:26:27.084
Unless, of course, you brought
your big brother as a chaperone.


691
00:26:27.086 --> 00:26:28.786
- Fine.
- Perfect.


692
00:26:28.788 --> 00:26:30.854
Pick me up at 8:00?
Great.


693
00:26:30.856 --> 00:26:32.356
- You... you live here.

694
00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.093
- All right, you just keep
doing that, buddy.


695
00:26:36.095 --> 00:26:38.896
- Oh, yeah.
Mm.


696
00:26:38.898 --> 00:26:40.864
Yo, kiss me back.
Kiss me back.


697
00:27:25.578 --> 00:27:27.044
- There she is!
The birthday girl!


698
00:27:27.046 --> 00:27:28.512
Give me your purse.
- Hi!


699
00:27:28.514 --> 00:27:31.114
Um, Evie, I think I said
small and tasteful.


700
00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:34.484
- Kate, small and tasteful is
how you describe an Olsen twin,


701
00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:36.486
not an awesome
b-day blowout bash.


702
00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:39.089
- Who are all these people?

703
00:27:39.091 --> 00:27:40.090
- Oh, my god, Rufus.

704
00:27:40.092 --> 00:27:41.391
The sign too?

705
00:27:41.393 --> 00:27:44.094
- What is happening,
you crazy idiots?


706
00:27:44.096 --> 00:27:47.164
Next song, "pumpkin goats"!

707
00:27:49.635 --> 00:27:52.135
- Okay, so I tried to get you
one of those naked girls


708
00:27:52.137 --> 00:27:54.371
that's covered in sashimi,
but she canceled!


709
00:27:54.373 --> 00:27:55.372
- Thank god.

710
00:27:55.374 --> 00:27:57.507
- So I improvised!

711
00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:01.278
- A crotch covered
in mini pizzas.


712
00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.379
You shouldn't have, Evie.

713
00:28:02.381 --> 00:28:04.147
- She really shouldn't have.

714
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:06.950
- Here we have Rufus wearing
the season's hottest snacks.


715
00:28:06.952 --> 00:28:08.452
Perfect for an Autumn wedding

716
00:28:08.454 --> 00:28:10.420
or to stuff our faces with later
when we're drunk.


717
00:28:10.422 --> 00:28:12.022
- Did you get in trouble
at the shop again?


718
00:28:12.024 --> 00:28:14.358
- It was worth it.
Happy birthday.


719
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.525
- Thank you!

720
00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:16.560
- Oh, let me show you
the kitchen!


721
00:28:16.562 --> 00:28:18.228
- Okay.
Bye.


722
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:19.429
Excuse me.

723
00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:23.233
- Do you have any Rihanna?

724
00:28:23.235 --> 00:28:24.668
- No!

725
00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:25.670
- Beyoncé?

726
00:28:27.206 --> 00:28:28.405
- No!

727
00:28:30.175 --> 00:28:32.276
Baha men?

728
00:28:32.278 --> 00:28:35.245
- Oh, "who let the dogs out"!

729
00:28:35.247 --> 00:28:36.914
No!
No, no.


730
00:28:36.916 --> 00:28:40.150
I hold them in the kennel
and then I play beats!


731
00:28:43.689 --> 00:28:46.223
- And the kitchen!
- Oh, wow.


732
00:28:48.661 --> 00:28:50.294
What's going on here?
- Take that cake!


733
00:28:50.296 --> 00:28:51.628
- It's funnel caking.

734
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:53.263
You funnel a beer
and then you eat cake.


735
00:28:53.265 --> 00:28:54.498
Kate, you got to get out more.

736
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.532
- Apparently.
- Happy birthday, Kate!


737
00:28:55.534 --> 00:28:58.702
- Oh, hey, Claire!

738
00:28:58.704 --> 00:29:00.404
- In honor of me finally
not being the only one


739
00:29:00.406 --> 00:29:03.040
in the 30s club,
I'd like to propose a toast.


740
00:29:03.042 --> 00:29:05.275
To Evie for organizing
one hell of a party.


741
00:29:05.277 --> 00:29:06.977
- Thank you.
I did.


742
00:29:06.979 --> 00:29:08.445
- And to Charlie
for having friends


743
00:29:08.447 --> 00:29:10.180
that I don't have to pretend
to like.


744
00:29:10.182 --> 00:29:11.381
- Yep.
- And to Kate.


745
00:29:11.383 --> 00:29:12.549
- Well, thank you.
Cheers!


746
00:29:12.551 --> 00:29:13.951
- Cheers!

747
00:29:13.953 --> 00:29:15.152
- Down the hatch.

748
00:29:16.288 --> 00:29:17.454
- Ah!

749
00:29:17.456 --> 00:29:19.289
- Whoo!

750
00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:21.458
- Okay, now let's go see who
can funnel a cake the fastest.


751
00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.593
- After Kate goes first!

752
00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:24.695
- I'm terrified.
- Yes!


753
00:29:24.697 --> 00:29:26.029
- Great!
- When aren't you?


754
00:29:26.031 --> 00:29:27.030
Let's go!
Peer pressure.


755
00:29:27.032 --> 00:29:28.031
Peer pressure!

756
00:29:28.033 --> 00:29:29.366
- Pace yourself, show off.

757
00:29:29.368 --> 00:29:30.367
I know you're excited,
but I don't want


758
00:29:30.369 --> 00:29:32.135
competitive Charlie coming out.

759
00:29:32.137 --> 00:29:34.237
Whenever she shows up, it always
means a horrible night for me.


760
00:29:34.239 --> 00:29:36.006
- I am pacing myself.

761
00:29:36.008 --> 00:29:37.374
- Promise?
- Yeah.


762
00:29:37.376 --> 00:29:38.608
Whoa!
You wore it?


763
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.610
- Oh, relax.
No one's gonna notice it.


764
00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:42.279
I couldn't bring myself
to take it off.


765
00:29:42.281 --> 00:29:43.347
This thing is amazing.

766
00:29:43.349 --> 00:29:44.448
- I know.
It is amazing.


767
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:45.649
- Can we afford it?
- Hmm?


768
00:29:45.651 --> 00:29:46.717
- What, financially?
No.


769
00:29:46.719 --> 00:29:49.553
But we can afford to be happy.

770
00:29:50.488 --> 00:29:51.488
No?

771
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:52.656
Okay.

772
00:29:52.658 --> 00:29:54.024
Could you go check
on Rufus for me?


773
00:29:54.026 --> 00:29:55.258
- Oh, sure.
He might be cold.


774
00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.259
- Yeah.
- You chill with your friends.


775
00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:57.260
- Okay.
- Okay?


776
00:29:57.262 --> 00:29:58.261
Bye.

777
00:29:58.263 --> 00:29:59.696
- Oh.
Hide it!


778
00:30:01.099 --> 00:30:03.300
- Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate!

779
00:30:03.302 --> 00:30:05.335
Whoo!

780
00:30:05.337 --> 00:30:06.403
Yeah!

781
00:30:06.405 --> 00:30:07.671
- Oh.
- Oh, my god!


782
00:30:07.673 --> 00:30:09.239
- That is terrible.

783
00:30:09.241 --> 00:30:11.241
- Okay, you guys,
remember how we were reminiscing


784
00:30:11.243 --> 00:30:12.509
about the glory days?

785
00:30:12.511 --> 00:30:14.077
- Hold on.
When were our glory days?


786
00:30:14.079 --> 00:30:15.445
- High school.

787
00:30:15.447 --> 00:30:17.047
- Okay, if high school
were our glory days,


788
00:30:17.049 --> 00:30:18.548
just take me out back
and do an old yeller.


789
00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.350
- Very cute.

790
00:30:20.352 --> 00:30:22.252
No, I thought it would be really
fun to invite some of the people


791
00:30:22.254 --> 00:30:24.321
that we went to high school
with tonight.


792
00:30:24.323 --> 00:30:25.622
So I got a yes
from Leslie marks...


793
00:30:25.624 --> 00:30:27.157
- Oh.

794
00:30:27.159 --> 00:30:30.327
- And from Kelly Evans,
and I got a maybe from...


795
00:30:30.329 --> 00:30:31.762
Are you ready for this?

796
00:30:31.764 --> 00:30:34.464
Ben Jenkins.
- Ben Jenkins?


797
00:30:34.466 --> 00:30:36.566
Why would you invite an ex
from high school?


798
00:30:36.568 --> 00:30:38.135
- What?
We're all adults.


799
00:30:38.137 --> 00:30:39.369
Get real.

800
00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:40.704
Look, I just think
it's really fun


801
00:30:40.706 --> 00:30:42.305
to see some of the people
from our past,


802
00:30:42.307 --> 00:30:43.306
something I hope that you...

803
00:30:43.308 --> 00:30:45.108
- What?
- Guess who.


804
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.811
- Um... someone who recently
ate ham?


805
00:30:47.813 --> 00:30:49.346
- Ah!

806
00:30:49.348 --> 00:30:52.049
- Oh!
Jesus.


807
00:30:52.051 --> 00:30:53.517
Peter Finch!

808
00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:55.552
Look at you.

809
00:30:55.554 --> 00:30:57.287
- Yeah, Evie found me
on Facebook.


810
00:30:57.289 --> 00:30:58.789
Made sure I got an invite.

811
00:30:58.791 --> 00:31:00.690
- Thanks, Evie.
- You're welcome.


812
00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:03.560
- So, uh, what have you been
up to the past decade?


813
00:31:03.562 --> 00:31:04.828
- All sorts of different stuff.

814
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.531
Watching football,
fantasy football,


815
00:31:07.533 --> 00:31:09.666
been coaching some football
over in Jefferson county,


816
00:31:09.668 --> 00:31:13.136
but I just moved back because...
Hold onto your panties...


817
00:31:13.138 --> 00:31:15.739
I'm the new sports director
at Lincoln high!


818
00:31:18.744 --> 00:31:20.844
Thank you for the warning.

819
00:31:20.846 --> 00:31:22.779
My panties could've been all...

820
00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:28.518
- Did she just skeet shoot
her panties?


821
00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.519
- I did indeed.
- Straight up.


822
00:31:29.521 --> 00:31:31.555
You were always so smart.

823
00:31:31.557 --> 00:31:33.423
I'm sure you're doing all sorts
of cool things with your life.


824
00:31:33.425 --> 00:31:36.593
- Um, you know,
lots of cool things.


825
00:31:36.595 --> 00:31:37.594
Keeping really busy.

826
00:31:37.596 --> 00:31:38.795
- Hey, I got a quick question

827
00:31:38.797 --> 00:31:40.730
about that sports director
thing.


828
00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:43.467
Um, who makes the uniforms
for Lincoln high?


829
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:45.802
Uhh...

830
00:31:45.804 --> 00:31:48.572
I think that's
Eastside trophy & print.


831
00:31:48.574 --> 00:31:49.739
- Got it.

832
00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:51.875
- Straight up, Kate,
you look fine.


833
00:31:51.877 --> 00:31:54.544
You haven't changed a bit
since high school.


834
00:31:54.546 --> 00:31:55.812
- Thank you.

835
00:31:55.814 --> 00:31:57.247
Peter...

836
00:31:57.249 --> 00:31:58.615
You look good too.

837
00:31:58.617 --> 00:32:00.517
- Hell yeah.

838
00:32:00.519 --> 00:32:02.252
- Okay, I'm gonna go clean up
the funnel cake mess, so...


839
00:32:02.254 --> 00:32:03.787
- Yeah, go do that.

840
00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:05.322
- So glad you're here!
It's so good to see you!


841
00:32:05.324 --> 00:32:06.389
- Peace, girl.

842
00:32:06.391 --> 00:32:07.390
- So, I'm...

843
00:32:07.392 --> 00:32:08.458
- straight up.
Evie?


844
00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.127
You look fine.

845
00:32:10.129 --> 00:32:13.196
You haven't changed a bit
since high school.


846
00:32:13.198 --> 00:32:15.665
Did you go to Lincoln high?

847
00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:17.234
- Yeah, I was a grade under you.

848
00:32:17.236 --> 00:32:18.602
- I don't think so.

849
00:32:18.604 --> 00:32:20.604
I'd remember
if you were ever under me.


850
00:32:22.808 --> 00:32:24.407
- Okay.

851
00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:26.176
I'm gonna go get Kate
some new panties.


852
00:32:26.178 --> 00:32:27.811
- Yeah, sounds good.
- Peace, girl.


853
00:32:27.813 --> 00:32:30.213
- Straight up.
- Panties.


854
00:32:30.215 --> 00:32:31.215
- Hell yeah.

855
00:32:45.496 --> 00:32:46.596
- Hey, buddy.

856
00:32:46.598 --> 00:32:47.697
- Hi.

857
00:32:47.699 --> 00:32:49.266
What you doing?

858
00:32:49.268 --> 00:32:51.401
Sitting here all by yourself
being overly dramatic?


859
00:32:51.403 --> 00:32:53.203
Just waiting for us
to come find you?


860
00:32:53.205 --> 00:32:54.771
- Took you ten minutes.

861
00:32:54.773 --> 00:32:56.206
New record, slowpokes.

862
00:32:56.208 --> 00:32:57.207
- Yikes.

863
00:32:57.209 --> 00:32:58.308
Sorry.

864
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:59.409
She mad.

865
00:32:59.411 --> 00:33:00.777
- No!
I'm not mad.


866
00:33:00.779 --> 00:33:02.445
I swear, I'm not mad.

867
00:33:02.447 --> 00:33:04.915
Even though this is exactly
what I did not ask for.


868
00:33:04.917 --> 00:33:06.416
- That is debatable.

869
00:33:06.418 --> 00:33:08.518
- But really...
And I can't believe


870
00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.620
I'm about to say this
to you guys...


871
00:33:10.622 --> 00:33:12.389
I can't stop thinking about
that letter.


872
00:33:12.391 --> 00:33:13.757
- Oh, my god.

873
00:33:13.759 --> 00:33:16.193
- Not one thing
on that damn letter came true.


874
00:33:16.195 --> 00:33:17.761
- Uh?
- Except for this party.


875
00:33:17.763 --> 00:33:19.563
- Yes, thank you.

876
00:33:19.565 --> 00:33:21.932
And, okay, who cares about
that stupid letter?


877
00:33:21.934 --> 00:33:23.733
I'm pretty sure that mine said

878
00:33:23.735 --> 00:33:25.635
I was gonna marry
Justin Timberlake


879
00:33:25.637 --> 00:33:27.571
and be Oscar nominated by now.

880
00:33:27.573 --> 00:33:28.939
Do you see me practicing
my acceptance speech?


881
00:33:28.941 --> 00:33:29.940
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.


882
00:33:29.942 --> 00:33:31.541
- Like, all the time.

883
00:33:31.543 --> 00:33:33.243
Like, in the car.
When you're hanging out.


884
00:33:33.245 --> 00:33:34.477
When you think you're alone
for even a second.


885
00:33:34.479 --> 00:33:35.478
- Great.
Good.


886
00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.214
It's a great speech.

887
00:33:37.216 --> 00:33:38.548
- Okay, I'm bringing this
back to me for a sec.


888
00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:39.883
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't know.


889
00:33:39.885 --> 00:33:42.919
That letter was just, like,
"hey, Kate!


890
00:33:42.921 --> 00:33:48.325
"Your job is super lame and your
fun is just organized clubs,


891
00:33:48.327 --> 00:33:50.293
"and one day you're gonna
get happy hour


892
00:33:50.295 --> 00:33:51.761
"with your two best friends

893
00:33:51.763 --> 00:33:53.797
"and your two friends
are gonna order club soda


894
00:33:53.799 --> 00:33:55.665
"and you're gonna realize
they're pregnant,


895
00:33:55.667 --> 00:33:57.434
"and they're gonna have kids
and they're not gonna have time


896
00:33:57.436 --> 00:33:59.269
"for taco Tuesday,
and you're just gonna be this,


897
00:33:59.271 --> 00:34:02.539
"like, weird, sad, lonely,
cat-lady aunt


898
00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:05.008
that sends them over-sexualized
birthday cards."


899
00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:06.309
- Kate, that is ridiculous.

900
00:34:06.311 --> 00:34:07.844
- I know it is

901
00:34:07.846 --> 00:34:08.845
'cause I hate cats.

902
00:34:08.847 --> 00:34:10.614
Yeah.

903
00:34:10.616 --> 00:34:12.549
And I'm not gonna compromise
this body with pregnancy.


904
00:34:12.551 --> 00:34:14.918
- Okay, first of all,
can we stop saying the p word?


905
00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.254
I'm pretty sure that
my mother-in-law's been slipping


906
00:34:17.256 --> 00:34:18.755
prenatal vitamins
into my Pinot Grigio.


907
00:34:18.757 --> 00:34:19.756
- That is scary.

908
00:34:19.758 --> 00:34:20.890
- Mm-hmm.
I know.


909
00:34:20.892 --> 00:34:22.259
But second of all,
you're just...


910
00:34:22.261 --> 00:34:23.593
You're in a rut, Kate.

911
00:34:23.595 --> 00:34:25.695
You have all of these
little routines


912
00:34:25.697 --> 00:34:27.831
and these little schedules
and you just...


913
00:34:27.833 --> 00:34:28.898
You never let loose.

914
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.367
Look at you.

915
00:34:30.369 --> 00:34:31.534
You're dressed like
a substitute teacher


916
00:34:31.536 --> 00:34:32.869
for your 30th birthday party.

917
00:34:32.871 --> 00:34:34.304
- Okay, excuse me,
this is faux leather.


918
00:34:34.306 --> 00:34:35.305
Pleather?

919
00:34:35.307 --> 00:34:37.474
- And substitutes are fun!

920
00:34:37.476 --> 00:34:38.675
- Okay.
- How dare you.


921
00:34:38.677 --> 00:34:40.277
- But you need to let loose.
- Yeah.


922
00:34:40.279 --> 00:34:41.544
- So tonight, let loose!

923
00:34:41.546 --> 00:34:43.013
- Yeah, party time.
- Yeah.


924
00:34:43.015 --> 00:34:44.981
- "Partee tyme."
- "Partee tyme."


925
00:34:44.983 --> 00:34:46.816
- What is the deal
with these shirts?


926
00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:48.018
I don't understand them at all.

927
00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:49.786
- It... it's a Rufus thing.

928
00:34:49.788 --> 00:34:51.921
- But it doesn't matter
because if anyone asks,


929
00:34:51.923 --> 00:34:53.990
it's our inside joke.

930
00:34:53.992 --> 00:34:55.759
- Perfect.

931
00:34:55.761 --> 00:34:57.994
- I kind of love that.
- Yes, you do!


932
00:34:57.996 --> 00:34:59.663
- Party time on three.

933
00:34:59.665 --> 00:35:00.664
- One.
Both: Two, three!


934
00:35:00.666 --> 00:35:02.065
- This is so stupid.

935
00:35:02.067 --> 00:35:04.067
All: Party time!

936
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:05.735
- Yeah, whoo!
- Here's yours.


937
00:35:05.737 --> 00:35:07.437
- Oh, it's my color.
- Yeah.


938
00:35:07.439 --> 00:35:09.005
You thought you were gonna
look cute tonight.


939
00:35:09.007 --> 00:35:10.607
No way.
- Nope.


940
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:11.708
That's what friends are for.
- Mm-hmm.


941
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:12.990
- It'll look great with leather.

942
00:35:13.745 --> 00:35:15.545
- Watch it.

943
00:35:15.547 --> 00:35:16.646
Rebecca!
You made it!


944
00:35:16.648 --> 00:35:17.647
- Hi!
- Hi!


945
00:35:17.649 --> 00:35:18.982
Oh.
Oh, okay.


946
00:35:18.984 --> 00:35:20.784
Kate, you remember Rebecca
from Lincoln?


947
00:35:20.786 --> 00:35:24.087
- Yeah, I think we had art
together for a few semesters.


948
00:35:24.089 --> 00:35:26.323
How you doing?
- Good.


949
00:35:26.325 --> 00:35:27.524
- Okay.

950
00:35:27.526 --> 00:35:29.526
- Ooh, man.
Poor thing.


951
00:35:29.528 --> 00:35:31.861
You know, her entire Instagram
feed is just covered in photos


952
00:35:31.863 --> 00:35:34.064
of her five kids
in matching outfits.


953
00:35:34.066 --> 00:35:35.932
You know, tonight might
actually be the first night


954
00:35:35.934 --> 00:35:37.801
that she's been out of her house
since Lincoln.


955
00:35:37.803 --> 00:35:41.338
- Well,
maybe she is super happy.


956
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.372
- Kate.

957
00:35:42.374 --> 00:35:43.973
Her newborn wears headbands.

958
00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:45.775
That woman is bored to death.

959
00:35:45.777 --> 00:35:47.477
Oh, my god.
Tommy Hughes is here.


960
00:35:47.479 --> 00:35:49.012
I am pretty sure
that I gave him an h.J.


961
00:35:49.014 --> 00:35:50.480
On the opening night
of "pippin."


962
00:35:50.482 --> 00:35:51.981
I should...

963
00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:53.383
- god, you know, it always
shocked me how much ass


964
00:35:53.385 --> 00:35:54.851
you theater kids got.

965
00:35:54.853 --> 00:35:56.686
- Oh, yeah, I mean, second only
to youth church groups.


966
00:35:56.688 --> 00:35:58.555
- Yeah, I'm gonna... I'll meet you
guys in there, okay?


967
00:35:58.557 --> 00:35:59.556
Hi!

968
00:35:59.558 --> 00:36:00.857
- Hi!
- Hey!


969
00:36:00.859 --> 00:36:02.726
Yes.
- Yeah, friends hug.


970
00:36:02.728 --> 00:36:04.394
- Yeah, let's do it.

971
00:36:04.396 --> 00:36:06.463
I am surprised to see you.

972
00:36:06.465 --> 00:36:08.365
- Was that a throw-away invite?

973
00:36:08.367 --> 00:36:11.000
- No, I'm saying I'm surprised
in a good way.


974
00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:12.869
- Cool.
- Yeah.


975
00:36:12.871 --> 00:36:14.537
- Why don't you have a drink
in your hand?


976
00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:17.006
- Guilty.
- Ooh, problem.


977
00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:19.876
Well, I'm gonna go get myself
and you a drink.


978
00:36:19.878 --> 00:36:21.411
Beer or wine?

979
00:36:21.413 --> 00:36:23.046
- A white Russian?
- No way.


980
00:36:23.048 --> 00:36:24.114
- They're delicious!

981
00:36:24.116 --> 00:36:26.383
- That's my favorite drink.

982
00:36:26.385 --> 00:36:27.384
- Really?
- Yeah.


983
00:36:27.386 --> 00:36:28.952
- Get out of here.

984
00:36:28.954 --> 00:36:31.421
- Well, i... i should let you go
do your birthday host thing,


985
00:36:31.423 --> 00:36:33.690
so I will make you a drink
and then come find you.


986
00:36:33.692 --> 00:36:34.858
- That is a perfect plan.

987
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.993
- Okay.
- Welcome to my party.


988
00:36:36.995 --> 00:36:38.728
- Thank you
for making me feel welcome.


989
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:40.563
- You're welcome
for feeling welcome.


990
00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:42.098
- Thank you.
- This could go all night.


991
00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.967
- Bye-bye.

992
00:36:50.542 --> 00:36:52.475
- Listen.
- Yes.


993
00:36:52.477 --> 00:36:54.577
- If we get separated tonight...
- Uh-huh.


994
00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:56.012
- Can... can you just keep it
that way?


995
00:36:56.014 --> 00:36:58.882
- Now, look, we can stay out
as late as you want, okay?


996
00:36:58.884 --> 00:37:00.717
As long as you do me one favor.

997
00:37:03.455 --> 00:37:05.488
Don't embarrass me.

998
00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:07.157
Hi.
I'm raven.


999
00:37:14.566 --> 00:37:16.933
- There's somebody
under there, dude.


1000
00:37:16.935 --> 00:37:18.134
- Don't mind me.

1001
00:37:19.905 --> 00:37:21.771
- Who did this to you?

1002
00:37:21.773 --> 00:37:25.575
- Are you the victim
of a snack avalanche?


1003
00:37:25.577 --> 00:37:26.576
- Uh, nope.

1004
00:37:26.578 --> 00:37:28.011
This is just my job tonight.

1005
00:37:28.013 --> 00:37:29.045
- Uh...

1006
00:37:29.047 --> 00:37:31.714
So your job is to be a plate?

1007
00:37:31.716 --> 00:37:33.116
- No.

1008
00:37:33.118 --> 00:37:35.018
I am a plate.

1009
00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.654
There was acid in that
baba ghanoush you just ate.


1010
00:37:38.824 --> 00:37:40.123
This is a hallucination.

1011
00:37:43.628 --> 00:37:44.861
Oooh.

1012
00:37:50.802 --> 00:37:52.202
- Oh, boy!

1013
00:37:52.204 --> 00:37:54.504
I hope your necks are made
of ice cream cones


1014
00:37:54.506 --> 00:37:58.007
because this next track is gonna
make your faces melt!


1015
00:38:03.248 --> 00:38:05.148
- I'm gonna have to see some ID,
young man.


1016
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:06.583
- I... i... i...

1017
00:38:06.585 --> 00:38:08.251
Just screwing with you.

1018
00:38:08.253 --> 00:38:09.886
Can I have a sip?

1019
00:38:09.888 --> 00:38:12.489
What is that, Glenfiddich
or Glenmorangie 25?


1020
00:38:14.493 --> 00:38:16.226
Apple juice.
You trying to kill me?


1021
00:38:18.063 --> 00:38:20.196
- Excuse me.

1022
00:38:20.198 --> 00:38:21.931
- How old are you?

1023
00:38:21.933 --> 00:38:23.500
- Hi.

1024
00:38:23.502 --> 00:38:24.501
- Hey!

1025
00:38:24.503 --> 00:38:25.735
Thanks for inviting us.

1026
00:38:25.737 --> 00:38:27.270
- Us?
- Yo!


1027
00:38:27.272 --> 00:38:28.671
What's up, Timmy?

1028
00:38:30.609 --> 00:38:32.208
- Um, it's Oliver.
- Yeah, that's what I said.


1029
00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:33.776
Dude, you know where I can get
a drink around here


1030
00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:34.844
for me and my boys?

1031
00:38:34.846 --> 00:38:37.113
- Um, the bar, I guess.

1032
00:38:37.115 --> 00:38:39.182
- Cool.
Kins, some Tequila?


1033
00:38:39.184 --> 00:38:40.517
Eh?

1034
00:38:40.519 --> 00:38:41.518
- I'm good.
Just water.


1035
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.619
- Lame.

1036
00:38:42.621 --> 00:38:43.720
Excuse me.
Coming through.


1037
00:38:43.722 --> 00:38:45.054
Beep, beep.
Watch your feet.


1038
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:54.797
All: 7, 8, 9,

1039
00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:00.203
- 14 seconds.
That's not bad.


1040
00:39:00.205 --> 00:39:01.804
It's not bad.
- Not bad?


1041
00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:03.039
Let's see what you got.

1042
00:39:04.776 --> 00:39:05.975
- Ex-squeeze me.

1043
00:39:08.747 --> 00:39:10.246
Oh, no, no, no.

1044
00:39:10.248 --> 00:39:12.916
I don't do yoga four days a week
to need a lift.


1045
00:39:14.886 --> 00:39:16.819
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

1046
00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:18.321
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

1047
00:39:18.323 --> 00:39:20.023
Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug!


1048
00:39:20.025 --> 00:39:21.691
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

1049
00:39:38.009 --> 00:39:40.209
- You have a very lovely spread,

1050
00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:42.612
but do you have any Sauerkraut?

1051
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:46.649
Pretzels?

1052
00:39:47.986 --> 00:39:50.186
Weiner schnitzel?

1053
00:39:50.188 --> 00:39:52.622
- Yeah, you might want
to nix the wiener talk


1054
00:39:52.624 --> 00:39:54.357
with my current state.

1055
00:39:54.359 --> 00:39:56.859
- Fine.
Taquitos it is.


1056
00:39:57.896 --> 00:40:00.029
- Who's Manning the booth?

1057
00:40:00.031 --> 00:40:01.965
- The boo...
Oh,<i>Scheisse!</i>


1058
00:40:03.735 --> 00:40:06.669
- It was nice catching up,
Rebecca!


1059
00:40:06.671 --> 00:40:08.137
Wow!
- Wow!


1060
00:40:08.139 --> 00:40:11.341
Didn't recognize me
in my weekend look, did you?


1061
00:40:11.343 --> 00:40:13.343
I just wanted to say hi.

1062
00:40:13.345 --> 00:40:16.079
I know that it's your birthday
and you probably don't want


1063
00:40:16.081 --> 00:40:18.014
your rad new boyfriend
hanging on you all night.


1064
00:40:18.016 --> 00:40:19.015
- Uh, Richard?

1065
00:40:19.017 --> 00:40:20.049
- Raven.
- Raven.


1066
00:40:20.051 --> 00:40:21.050
Raven.

1067
00:40:21.052 --> 00:40:22.251
Really try and drop it down.

1068
00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:23.620
It should be from your
diaphragm.


1069
00:40:23.622 --> 00:40:25.154
- Raven, you're not
my boyfriend.


1070
00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:27.890
We went on one date, and I
army crawled away from you.


1071
00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:29.759
- Yeah, yeah.
No, I know.


1072
00:40:29.761 --> 00:40:31.394
And it's... your upper body
strength is one of the things


1073
00:40:31.396 --> 00:40:33.029
I love most about you.

1074
00:40:34.032 --> 00:40:35.264
- Okay.
Okay, great.


1075
00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:37.700
- Anyway, boyfriend,
future boyfriend,


1076
00:40:37.702 --> 00:40:39.736
whatever you want to call it,
my dear.


1077
00:40:39.738 --> 00:40:41.638
Raven will be around.

1078
00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:42.972
Permission to touch
thy shoulders.


1079
00:40:42.974 --> 00:40:44.641
- Not permissed.
- Raven understands.


1080
00:40:44.643 --> 00:40:45.942
Raven apologizes.

1081
00:40:45.944 --> 00:40:46.976
I look to... oh.
Sorry.


1082
00:40:46.978 --> 00:40:49.045
Sorry.
Raven is sorry.


1083
00:40:49.047 --> 00:40:50.647
Raven is sorry about that
as well.


1084
00:40:50.649 --> 00:40:52.248
Okay.

1085
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:55.018
That guy just spent 20 minutes
trying to sell me a VCR.


1086
00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.419
- Did you buy it?

1087
00:40:56.421 --> 00:40:57.854
- Well, I wasn't gonna,
but then he threw in


1088
00:40:57.856 --> 00:40:58.955
all ten season
of "friends," so...


1089
00:40:58.957 --> 00:41:00.289
Nice.

1090
00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:01.290
Thank you.

1091
00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:02.692
- Yeah.

1092
00:41:07.165 --> 00:41:08.231
Ooh.

1093
00:41:08.233 --> 00:41:09.399
Yeah, you...
- are you okay?


1094
00:41:09.401 --> 00:41:10.400
- Maybe take
these drinks outside?


1095
00:41:10.402 --> 00:41:11.401
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


1096
00:41:11.403 --> 00:41:13.136
- Yeah.
- War zone.


1097
00:41:13.138 --> 00:41:15.058
- I'll be out there in, like,
two... two minutes.


1098
00:41:16.408 --> 00:41:18.041
Hey, Evie?

1099
00:41:18.043 --> 00:41:21.044
This is gonna sound nuts,
but did you invite raven


1100
00:41:21.046 --> 00:41:22.045
to this party?

1101
00:41:22.047 --> 00:41:23.746
- Raven-symoné?

1102
00:41:23.748 --> 00:41:25.314
Yeah, of course I did,
but she never tweeted back.


1103
00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:27.083
I'm sorry.
- It's okay.


1104
00:41:27.085 --> 00:41:28.718
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where did you get this?


1105
00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.153
- Mantle.

1106
00:41:30.155 --> 00:41:33.256
- This is a 1700s Norwegian ski
that a king


1107
00:41:33.258 --> 00:41:34.757
did something for.

1108
00:41:34.759 --> 00:41:36.693
You know what?
Let's just do this.


1109
00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:40.997
- I've never met anyone else
who will make a white Russian


1110
00:41:40.999 --> 00:41:42.732
at a party.

1111
00:41:42.734 --> 00:41:44.867
- Oh, see, what I do is
I rationalize all the vodka


1112
00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:47.236
I'm drinking because the milk
is good for my teeth.


1113
00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:48.705
- Ah.
- Yeah.


1114
00:41:48.707 --> 00:41:50.306
What's your excuse?

1115
00:41:50.308 --> 00:41:52.875
I went through
a "big lebowski" phase.


1116
00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:54.410
- Yikes.

1117
00:41:54.412 --> 00:41:56.746
- Yeah, there's way too many
photos of me wearing a robe


1118
00:41:56.748 --> 00:41:59.916
in public from that time,
but I can bowl a 230,


1119
00:41:59.918 --> 00:42:00.917
so there's that.

1120
00:42:00.919 --> 00:42:03.453
- I am impressed.

1121
00:42:03.455 --> 00:42:05.254
- I'm the one who's impressed.

1122
00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:06.889
I mean, don't take
this the wrong way...


1123
00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:10.126
- oh, that is such a good way
to start a sentence.


1124
00:42:10.128 --> 00:42:12.962
- I guess I just didn't...
I didn't think that somebody


1125
00:42:12.964 --> 00:42:15.331
who owns scrubs
with cartoon teeth


1126
00:42:15.333 --> 00:42:18.501
wearing cowboy hats on them
would have such a Rager.


1127
00:42:18.503 --> 00:42:20.036
- So what do you do?

1128
00:42:20.038 --> 00:42:23.172
Are you, like,
a lumberjack or something?


1129
00:42:23.174 --> 00:42:24.807
- Was that a flannel joke?

1130
00:42:24.809 --> 00:42:25.875
You know, flannels are in.

1131
00:42:25.877 --> 00:42:27.243
- Apparently.

1132
00:42:27.245 --> 00:42:30.046
- I wish I did something
as manly as lumberjacking.


1133
00:42:30.048 --> 00:42:31.748
I'm in website design.

1134
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:33.282
- Oh, cool.

1135
00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:35.918
So you're a nerd.

1136
00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:36.920
- Um...

1137
00:42:37.989 --> 00:42:40.823
Uh, so how does one fall into...

1138
00:42:40.825 --> 00:42:44.827
- the glamorous life
of an orthodontist assistant?


1139
00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:47.997
Well, first, you get made fun of
for your braces in high school.


1140
00:42:47.999 --> 00:42:49.832
- Oh, I had to wear an eye patch
in kindergarten


1141
00:42:49.834 --> 00:42:51.267
to correct a lazy eye.

1142
00:42:51.269 --> 00:42:52.835
In reality,
I looked like a pirate


1143
00:42:52.837 --> 00:42:55.271
and everybody in my class
thought it was awesome.


1144
00:42:55.273 --> 00:42:57.473
- Cool brag, I guess.

1145
00:42:59.511 --> 00:43:01.344
- Yeah, I don't know why
I shared that.


1146
00:43:01.346 --> 00:43:04.213
I think I was trying to relate.

1147
00:43:04.215 --> 00:43:07.350
- Um, no, so I actually went
to school, dental school,


1148
00:43:07.352 --> 00:43:09.819
to be an orthodontist,
but I don't know.


1149
00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:13.122
I just freaked out when they
wanted me to pull a tooth.


1150
00:43:13.124 --> 00:43:14.791
It's really scary.

1151
00:43:14.793 --> 00:43:15.925
Gave me the heebie-jeebies.

1152
00:43:15.927 --> 00:43:17.426
- The heebie-jeebies?

1153
00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:20.096
Ma'am, is this
your 90th birthday?


1154
00:43:20.098 --> 00:43:21.931
- Okay, how dare you.

1155
00:43:21.933 --> 00:43:23.332
The heebie-jeebies is a thing.

1156
00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:24.433
People say that I think.

1157
00:43:24.435 --> 00:43:25.935
- No, I'm sorry.

1158
00:43:25.937 --> 00:43:27.036
I shouldn't make fun
of somebody who knows


1159
00:43:27.038 --> 00:43:28.271
I wear an adult retainer.

1160
00:43:28.273 --> 00:43:29.472
You have the power.

1161
00:43:29.474 --> 00:43:31.207
- Cannot wait to abuse it.

1162
00:43:31.209 --> 00:43:34.310
- Well, I cannot wait
to be abused.


1163
00:43:34.312 --> 00:43:38.214
- Okay, what are we
even talking about?


1164
00:43:39.517 --> 00:43:42.151
- Push up! Push up!
Push up!


1165
00:43:47.992 --> 00:43:49.525
- What did we miss?

1166
00:43:49.527 --> 00:43:52.161
- Competitive Charlie is back
and she's out of control.


1167
00:43:52.163 --> 00:43:53.362
- Really?

1168
00:43:56.234 --> 00:43:58.968
Claire, this is Dan.
Dan, Claire.


1169
00:44:02.407 --> 00:44:05.308
- I am responsible
for all of that.


1170
00:44:06.511 --> 00:44:07.610
- Whoo!

1171
00:44:07.612 --> 00:44:09.879
All right, all right.

1172
00:44:09.881 --> 00:44:13.916
Round three will commence
in this room in 15 minutes.


1173
00:44:13.918 --> 00:44:15.318
- Okay.

1174
00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.886
- What happened
to our pinky promise?


1175
00:44:16.888 --> 00:44:18.921
- Oh, Claire bear,
everything is under control.


1176
00:44:18.923 --> 00:44:20.523
- Hey, Charlie,
do you want me to leave the ice


1177
00:44:20.525 --> 00:44:22.425
in the kiddie pool or unload it
for the sumo challenge?


1178
00:44:22.427 --> 00:44:24.060
- Leave it in the kiddie pool.

1179
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:27.063
Just trust me.
- Take it easy.


1180
00:44:27.065 --> 00:44:28.497
I don't want to be a widow
before we even get married.


1181
00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:30.299
- Oh, but you look so good
in black.


1182
00:44:30.301 --> 00:44:31.500
- Yeah.

1183
00:44:37.108 --> 00:44:39.976
- Ready to go?

1184
00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:00.329
- Can I play?

1185
00:45:02.667 --> 00:45:04.100
- Yeah, yeah.
Totally, totally.


1186
00:45:04.102 --> 00:45:05.301
- Yeah?

1187
00:45:08.306 --> 00:45:12.341
- Uh, where's Derrick?

1188
00:45:12.343 --> 00:45:16.412
- Uh, having a pissing contest.

1189
00:45:16.414 --> 00:45:18.381
- Is he still trying to
out push up that short lady?


1190
00:45:18.383 --> 00:45:23.286
- No, he's literally outside
having a pissing contest


1191
00:45:23.288 --> 00:45:24.420
with his friends.

1192
00:45:24.422 --> 00:45:25.521
- Oh, wow.

1193
00:45:25.523 --> 00:45:26.522
- Yeah.

1194
00:45:26.524 --> 00:45:28.324
- Um, do you know how to play?

1195
00:45:28.326 --> 00:45:30.159
- Yeah.
Um...


1196
00:45:30.161 --> 00:45:32.962
Uh...

1197
00:45:32.964 --> 00:45:35.531
So the horse can, like,
gallop to the other side, right?


1198
00:45:35.533 --> 00:45:36.933
Like boom.

1199
00:45:36.935 --> 00:45:39.001
- Not... not traditionally.

1200
00:45:39.003 --> 00:45:41.270
I mean, we can... we can play by
different rules or something.


1201
00:45:41.272 --> 00:45:46.609
There's other forms of chess,
I think, so...


1202
00:45:46.611 --> 00:45:47.610
Just...

1203
00:45:47.612 --> 00:45:48.945
- I was...
I...


1204
00:45:48.947 --> 00:45:49.946
Totally kidding.

1205
00:45:49.948 --> 00:45:51.647
Just kidding.

1206
00:45:51.649 --> 00:45:54.517
- Oh.
Wow.


1207
00:45:54.519 --> 00:45:56.018
- Check mate.

1208
00:46:01.159 --> 00:46:02.491
- And now I have eight cats.

1209
00:46:02.493 --> 00:46:03.693
- Seriously?
- No!


1210
00:46:03.695 --> 00:46:05.494
- Kate!
Kate, you have to come see this.


1211
00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:08.030
We started doing body shots,
and this one girl's belly button


1212
00:46:08.032 --> 00:46:09.732
can hold, like, eight ounces.

1213
00:46:09.734 --> 00:46:11.467
- That is gross.
- I know.


1214
00:46:11.469 --> 00:46:14.337
- Uh, Evie, this is Dan.
Dan, Evie.


1215
00:46:14.339 --> 00:46:15.571
She threw me the birthday party.

1216
00:46:15.573 --> 00:46:17.173
- Congrats.
- Thank you.


1217
00:46:17.175 --> 00:46:19.075
- This is just like
parties in high school.


1218
00:46:19.077 --> 00:46:20.409
- Thank you.

1219
00:46:20.411 --> 00:46:22.478
- Or at least
how I imagined them to be


1220
00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.447
as I sat at home
and played "Oregon trail."


1221
00:46:24.449 --> 00:46:26.082
Yes.

1222
00:46:26.084 --> 00:46:28.317
Alerting children
of the dangers of dysentery.


1223
00:46:28.319 --> 00:46:30.086
- I was more of a typhoid guy
myself.


1224
00:46:30.088 --> 00:46:31.087
- You know what?

1225
00:46:31.089 --> 00:46:32.088
I can see that about you.

1226
00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:34.256
- Whoa.
Major flirt alert.


1227
00:46:34.258 --> 00:46:35.558
Don't want to get hurt.

1228
00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.693
- Uh...
- Eject.


1229
00:46:37.695 --> 00:46:39.562
- You know, I'm gonna go take
that body shot.


1230
00:46:39.564 --> 00:46:43.265
Do you want to watch
this disaster?


1231
00:46:43.267 --> 00:46:44.567
- I'm good.

1232
00:46:44.569 --> 00:46:47.436
Body shots give me
the heebie-jeebies.


1233
00:46:47.438 --> 00:46:48.437
- See what you did there.

1234
00:46:48.439 --> 00:46:49.438
You're clever.

1235
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.107
- Well, it was for your benefit.

1236
00:46:57.382 --> 00:46:59.248
- Something got you down,
sad clown?


1237
00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.050
- Look at that.

1238
00:47:01.052 --> 00:47:03.552
My girlfriend flirting with some
other guy right in front of me.


1239
00:47:03.554 --> 00:47:05.421
She bossed me then tossed me.

1240
00:47:05.423 --> 00:47:07.123
- Shocking.

1241
00:47:07.125 --> 00:47:09.058
The guy in all black
is depressed about something.


1242
00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.559
- Ha-ha.
That's hilarious.


1243
00:47:10.561 --> 00:47:13.129
- Lucky for you,
clichés are one of my things.


1244
00:47:13.131 --> 00:47:15.164
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.


1245
00:47:15.166 --> 00:47:16.532
Kate! Kate! Kate! Kate!

1246
00:47:16.534 --> 00:47:18.734
Kate! Kate! Kate!

1247
00:47:18.736 --> 00:47:20.536
- And now I'm gonna go
brush my teeth.


1248
00:47:20.538 --> 00:47:23.539
- Yeah!
- No offense.


1249
00:47:23.541 --> 00:47:25.674
I'm sorry, were you wearing wool
earlier today?


1250
00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:26.776
- Totally.
- Okay, me next!


1251
00:47:26.778 --> 00:47:28.177
Me next!

1252
00:47:34.552 --> 00:47:35.785
- Ah, I'll take this one.

1253
00:47:35.787 --> 00:47:37.319
Well, well, well.

1254
00:47:37.321 --> 00:47:38.754
If it isn't the one
that got away.


1255
00:47:38.756 --> 00:47:42.491
The Sandra Dee to my Danny Zuko.

1256
00:47:42.493 --> 00:47:44.160
- Well, I'll be damned.

1257
00:47:44.162 --> 00:47:45.361
Ben Jenkins.

1258
00:47:49.133 --> 00:47:50.166
Mm!

1259
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:54.070
It's good.
- Okay.


1260
00:47:54.072 --> 00:47:55.604
- Yeah.

1261
00:47:55.606 --> 00:47:58.407
So look at you.
You haven't aged a bit.


1262
00:47:58.409 --> 00:48:02.178
- Same for you,
except you are super ripped now.


1263
00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:05.081
- I'm just trying
to make an ex jealous.


1264
00:48:05.083 --> 00:48:06.215
- An ex?
Oh.


1265
00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:07.483
Bravo.

1266
00:48:07.485 --> 00:48:08.717
- So where have you been hiding
these days?


1267
00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:10.653
I don't know.

1268
00:48:10.655 --> 00:48:14.390
I'm here and there and, um...

1269
00:48:17.328 --> 00:48:19.195
Just give me a second, Ben.

1270
00:48:19.197 --> 00:48:21.397
Don't leave.

1271
00:48:21.399 --> 00:48:23.632
- You are like a girl.
You're so pretty.


1272
00:48:23.634 --> 00:48:24.633
- Hi!

1273
00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:25.634
How are you?
Great.


1274
00:48:25.636 --> 00:48:26.869
You know what?

1275
00:48:26.871 --> 00:48:28.404
I don't remember
inviting you, Ashley.


1276
00:48:28.406 --> 00:48:30.139
- Oh, that's funny.

1277
00:48:30.141 --> 00:48:31.540
I don't remember the fountain
being full of puke


1278
00:48:31.542 --> 00:48:33.642
when I sold this house
to frank and Nancy.


1279
00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:35.311
You know what?

1280
00:48:35.313 --> 00:48:36.512
Let me just text Nancy really
quick to see if...


1281
00:48:36.514 --> 00:48:37.580
- you know what?

1282
00:48:37.582 --> 00:48:39.615
Please, come in.

1283
00:48:39.617 --> 00:48:41.684
Make yourself at home.

1284
00:48:41.686 --> 00:48:42.685
- Thank you.

1285
00:48:42.687 --> 00:48:43.819
- Mm-hmm.

1286
00:48:45.189 --> 00:48:47.456
- Ooh, jell-o shots.
All right.


1287
00:48:47.458 --> 00:48:49.558
You know, I am starving.

1288
00:48:50.862 --> 00:48:52.261
Mm.

1289
00:48:54.265 --> 00:48:55.798
- It is.
- That is awesome.


1290
00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.133
- How's it going?
- Excuse me.


1291
00:48:57.135 --> 00:48:58.234
- How you doing?

1292
00:48:58.236 --> 00:48:59.268
- Hey, girls!
- Hey, Kate!


1293
00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:00.669
Hey, come here for one second.

1294
00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:02.605
Just one quick second.
- Is everything okay?


1295
00:49:02.607 --> 00:49:04.707
- I am calling
an official meeting.


1296
00:49:04.709 --> 00:49:06.408
- Are we the baby-sitters club
now?


1297
00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:07.710
- No.

1298
00:49:07.712 --> 00:49:08.844
Oh, but if we were,
I would totally be


1299
00:49:08.846 --> 00:49:10.246
Caucasian Claudia Kishi.

1300
00:49:10.248 --> 00:49:11.447
- You know, I see you
as more of a dawn.


1301
00:49:11.449 --> 00:49:12.448
- Okay, guys.
Hey, sorry.


1302
00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:14.150
Can we move this on?

1303
00:49:14.152 --> 00:49:15.351
I'm, like, really in the middle
of something.


1304
00:49:15.353 --> 00:49:16.485
- Okay, um, Ashley's here.

1305
00:49:16.487 --> 00:49:18.320
Both: Ashley Driscoll?

1306
00:49:18.322 --> 00:49:20.723
- Yeah, and I asked her to
leave, but apparently she knows


1307
00:49:20.725 --> 00:49:23.626
Todd's parents, and...
But then I thought about


1308
00:49:23.628 --> 00:49:25.861
your letter and the p.S.

1309
00:49:25.863 --> 00:49:27.930
This is a perfect opportunity
to cross something off


1310
00:49:27.932 --> 00:49:29.398
of that stupid letter.

1311
00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:30.833
- Yeah, we could make her
eat shit.


1312
00:49:30.835 --> 00:49:32.168
- Actually,
I'm not really thinking about


1313
00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:34.436
the letter anymore, guys.

1314
00:49:34.438 --> 00:49:36.438
- What do you mean you're not
really thinking about


1315
00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.174
the letter anymore?

1316
00:49:38.176 --> 00:49:39.575
Like, two hours ago
you were gonna have that letter


1317
00:49:39.577 --> 00:49:41.310
tattooed on your thigh.

1318
00:49:41.312 --> 00:49:43.846
Ooh, by the way, if anyone wants
to get tattoos tonight,


1319
00:49:43.848 --> 00:49:45.481
I am so game!

1320
00:49:45.483 --> 00:49:47.850
- No. You know that guy Dan
I was talking to?


1321
00:49:47.852 --> 00:49:49.718
- Yeah, the guy in the flannel?

1322
00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.320
- I think I like him.

1323
00:49:51.322 --> 00:49:52.688
He's cute, right?

1324
00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:53.889
- Yeah.

1325
00:49:53.891 --> 00:49:57.560
- I would let him wear me
like a bonnet.


1326
00:49:57.562 --> 00:49:59.395
- I like a boy.

1327
00:49:59.397 --> 00:50:01.697
And the best part is I think
he likes me too.


1328
00:50:01.699 --> 00:50:02.865
- That's even better, really.

1329
00:50:02.867 --> 00:50:04.333
- I'm having fun tonight.

1330
00:50:04.335 --> 00:50:05.901
- You should be!

1331
00:50:05.903 --> 00:50:07.703
- Can you guys guess
what I'm doing?


1332
00:50:07.705 --> 00:50:08.837
- I have no idea.

1333
00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:09.939
- I'm Kate

1334
00:50:09.941 --> 00:50:12.341
climbing out of her rut.

1335
00:50:12.343 --> 00:50:13.676
- Yeah, but see,
that's also how you dance.


1336
00:50:13.678 --> 00:50:14.910
That's why it's confusing.

1337
00:50:14.912 --> 00:50:16.812
- Oh, we should do shots
to celebrate.


1338
00:50:16.814 --> 00:50:19.448
- I will rain check because
I'm gonna pace myself tonight.


1339
00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:21.450
Gonna see how things go
with Dan.


1340
00:50:26.424 --> 00:50:29.625
- Hey, uh, do you guys know
the birthday girl, Kate?


1341
00:50:29.627 --> 00:50:30.960
- Of course.

1342
00:50:30.962 --> 00:50:32.895
What, do you think we were,
like, just riding by


1343
00:50:32.897 --> 00:50:34.897
on our razor scooters
and were like,


1344
00:50:34.899 --> 00:50:36.799
"hey, there's a party,
let's go in there"?


1345
00:50:36.801 --> 00:50:39.468
- Yeah, and then we accidentally
ate some Mediterranean


1346
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:42.004
eggplant dip that had acid in it
so now we feel trapped here?


1347
00:50:42.006 --> 00:50:43.539
- Okay.

1348
00:50:43.541 --> 00:50:45.841
Well,
when she comes back down here,


1349
00:50:45.843 --> 00:50:49.445
can you let her know that
Dan ran out to grab more milk?


1350
00:50:49.447 --> 00:50:50.879
I'll be back in, like,
ten minutes.


1351
00:50:52.984 --> 00:50:54.950
- Sure, man.
No problem.


1352
00:50:58.489 --> 00:51:00.522
- Was that a human
we were talking to?


1353
00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.326
- Girl, you look fine.

1354
00:51:04.328 --> 00:51:05.961
You haven't changed a bit
since high school.


1355
00:51:05.963 --> 00:51:08.330
- I'd rather die.

1356
00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:10.813
Are there any more jell-o sho...

1357
00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:15.437
Who put a banister here?

1358
00:51:15.439 --> 00:51:18.907
This should be an open-floor
concept, you Jack holes!


1359
00:51:20.478 --> 00:51:23.279
- You... you aren't thinking
of driving, are you?


1360
00:51:23.281 --> 00:51:24.847
- I live six blocks away.

1361
00:51:24.849 --> 00:51:25.981
- Okay, that's a relief.

1362
00:51:25.983 --> 00:51:27.283
- Of course I'm driving.

1363
00:51:27.285 --> 00:51:29.385
Stupid.

1364
00:51:29.387 --> 00:51:31.654
- Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1365
00:51:31.656 --> 00:51:33.622
Is that a magic 8 ball keychain?

1366
00:51:33.624 --> 00:51:34.890
- Yes.

1367
00:51:34.892 --> 00:51:37.826
It tells me
when I should have sex.


1368
00:51:37.828 --> 00:51:39.662
Do you want to have sex?

1369
00:51:39.664 --> 00:51:40.663
- How about this:

1370
00:51:40.665 --> 00:51:41.864
I drive your car home for you

1371
00:51:41.866 --> 00:51:43.732
and then I just walk back here.

1372
00:51:43.734 --> 00:51:45.901
I've had one drink and there's
no way I can let you drive.


1373
00:51:45.903 --> 00:51:48.337
- Fine, but on one condition:

1374
00:51:48.339 --> 00:51:50.506
You got to take me
to the quick pick


1375
00:51:50.508 --> 00:51:53.709
and get me some nachos.

1376
00:51:53.711 --> 00:51:55.844
- I was going there anyway.

1377
00:51:55.846 --> 00:51:57.780
- Good.
I don't have any money.


1378
00:51:57.782 --> 00:51:59.648
I want 32 jalapenos.

1379
00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:01.350
I want an ounce of nacho cheese.

1380
00:52:01.352 --> 00:52:02.384
No more.

1381
00:52:28.512 --> 00:52:30.646
- You know what?
I will take that shot.


1382
00:54:04.141 --> 00:54:06.442
- Do you mind if we sped this up
a little bit?


1383
00:54:06.444 --> 00:54:08.811
I kind of want to get back
to the party.


1384
00:54:08.813 --> 00:54:11.513
- Well, now you've gone
and distracted me.


1385
00:54:11.515 --> 00:54:14.583
I added too many jalapenos.

1386
00:54:14.585 --> 00:54:15.784
Got to start over.

1387
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:21.824
- Ladies!
Ladies and gentlemen!


1388
00:54:21.826 --> 00:54:24.593
Men and gentle ladies!

1389
00:54:24.595 --> 00:54:27.529
In our tie-breaking round,

1390
00:54:27.531 --> 00:54:30.566
we will test a match
of endurance.


1391
00:54:30.568 --> 00:54:34.470
Peter and I will be lifting
these empty kegs


1392
00:54:34.472 --> 00:54:35.938
above our heads

1393
00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:37.473
for as long as we can.

1394
00:54:37.475 --> 00:54:38.475
- Yeah!

1395
00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:41.743
- First person to break loses.

1396
00:54:41.745 --> 00:54:43.579
Peter!

1397
00:54:43.581 --> 00:54:45.247
Are you ready?

1398
00:54:45.249 --> 00:54:46.748
- You're going down.

1399
00:54:50.887 --> 00:54:53.188
- Three, two, one!

1400
00:55:03.533 --> 00:55:05.133
- Oh, it's super easy for me.

1401
00:55:21.752 --> 00:55:23.185
Oh, yes!

1402
00:55:23.187 --> 00:55:24.219
Eat it, mouse girl.

1403
00:55:24.221 --> 00:55:25.888
I am the greatest!

1404
00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:29.224
You guys, you guys.
You heard it here first, folks.


1405
00:55:29.226 --> 00:55:31.093
Peter won.

1406
00:55:31.095 --> 00:55:33.862
He's, like,
way stronger than me.


1407
00:55:33.864 --> 00:55:35.163
- What?
No!


1408
00:55:35.165 --> 00:55:36.965
- Yeah.
Who knew?


1409
00:55:38.201 --> 00:55:39.735
- I'm gonna head home.

1410
00:55:39.737 --> 00:55:41.303
Can you let Charlie know
that she should go ahead


1411
00:55:41.305 --> 00:55:42.304
and crash here tonight?

1412
00:55:42.306 --> 00:55:43.572
- No problem.

1413
00:55:43.574 --> 00:55:46.775
Can you scratch my right cheek?

1414
00:55:46.777 --> 00:55:47.777
- Okay.

1415
00:56:02.859 --> 00:56:03.859
- I need to talk to you.

1416
00:56:03.861 --> 00:56:05.294
- Holy shit.

1417
00:56:05.296 --> 00:56:06.995
- I met someone.

1418
00:56:06.997 --> 00:56:08.664
- That's amazing.

1419
00:56:08.666 --> 00:56:11.633
- Yeah, well, but you guys...
You actually have a history


1420
00:56:11.635 --> 00:56:12.935
with him.

1421
00:56:12.937 --> 00:56:14.303
Oh, god.

1422
00:56:14.305 --> 00:56:16.204
Okay, it all started because
raven was really upset


1423
00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:17.739
about your breakup, and...

1424
00:56:17.741 --> 00:56:19.107
- Raven and I didn't break...
- Yeah.


1425
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:20.142
- Okay.

1426
00:56:20.144 --> 00:56:21.610
- And... but he's gonna be okay.

1427
00:56:21.612 --> 00:56:24.713
He just... he needs to lick
his wounds,


1428
00:56:24.715 --> 00:56:27.015
and I really need
to lick his face.


1429
00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:29.818
- Jules,

1430
00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:30.819
I'm happy for you.

1431
00:56:30.821 --> 00:56:31.987
- Really?
- Yeah.


1432
00:56:31.989 --> 00:56:33.155
- Are you sure?
'Cause i...


1433
00:56:33.157 --> 00:56:35.357
- go forth and cage that bird.

1434
00:56:35.359 --> 00:56:37.192
- I mean, 'cause,
like, girl COD...


1435
00:56:37.194 --> 00:56:39.628
Like, I'm gonna cage it hard, so
I just want to make sure that,


1436
00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:40.729
like, it's cool.

1437
00:56:40.731 --> 00:56:41.863
Like, probably hard.

1438
00:56:41.865 --> 00:56:43.298
Not, like, prison hard,
but, like...


1439
00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:44.900
- I really don't need details
about it though.


1440
00:56:44.902 --> 00:56:45.901
- Okay.
- Please leave.


1441
00:56:45.903 --> 00:56:47.202
- Thank you.
Okay, thank you.


1442
00:56:47.204 --> 00:56:48.937
Oh my... oh, yes.

1443
00:57:10.361 --> 00:57:12.194
- Guess what this is.

1444
00:57:12.196 --> 00:57:14.129
- Stop it.

1445
00:57:14.131 --> 00:57:16.965
- Little Evie dogs, junior year,
singing an original love song


1446
00:57:16.967 --> 00:57:18.667
to yours truly.

1447
00:57:21.238 --> 00:57:23.872
You don't happen to have
a dusty compact disc player


1448
00:57:23.874 --> 00:57:24.874
around here, do you?

1449
00:57:28.979 --> 00:57:30.412
- In my car.

1450
00:57:32.182 --> 00:57:33.415
- Let's go.

1451
00:57:33.417 --> 00:57:36.051
- Okay.

1452
00:57:43.327 --> 00:57:44.893
- This is normal.

1453
00:57:44.895 --> 00:57:46.094
I would do this sober.

1454
00:57:49.099 --> 00:57:50.365
Not weird.

1455
00:57:50.367 --> 00:57:53.402
Just a grown woman
in a China cabinet


1456
00:57:53.404 --> 00:57:54.803
calling a dude.

1457
00:58:01.679 --> 00:58:03.211
Okay.

1458
00:58:03.213 --> 00:58:05.180
One more.

1459
00:58:05.182 --> 00:58:06.314
If he answers, cool.

1460
00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:08.150
If he doesn't, screw him.

1461
00:58:12.356 --> 00:58:14.356
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi!


1462
00:58:14.358 --> 00:58:17.325
Luke!
It is Kate.


1463
00:58:18.896 --> 00:58:21.296
- Kate, is everything okay?

1464
00:58:21.298 --> 00:58:22.464
It's, like, one in the morning.

1465
00:58:22.466 --> 00:58:24.366
<i>
- Oh, yeah.</i>

1466
00:58:24.368 --> 00:58:26.735
I'm actually better than okay

1467
00:58:26.737 --> 00:58:29.938
because I just turned 30.

1468
00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:32.908
It's my 30th birthday.

1469
00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:34.443
Or it was till, like,
an hour ago.


1470
00:58:34.445 --> 00:58:36.478
<i>
- Hey, happy birthday.</i>

1471
00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.380
<i>Sorry, it's just...
It's late here.</i>


1472
00:58:38.382 --> 00:58:40.882
- Oh, did I wake up...
Did I wake up the baby?


1473
00:58:40.884 --> 00:58:42.184
<i>You have a baby!</i>

1474
00:58:42.186 --> 00:58:43.185
<i>Wow!</i>

1475
00:58:43.187 --> 00:58:44.352
- I have a baby.

1476
00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:47.289
- That is a weird sentence
to say.


1477
00:58:47.291 --> 00:58:51.827
Is it, like, crawling yet
or teething?


1478
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:53.962
They cry, like, so much, I hear.

1479
00:58:53.964 --> 00:58:55.197
- Hey, what's up?
Are you okay?


1480
00:58:55.199 --> 00:58:56.198
It's...

1481
00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.332
<i>- oh, you know what?</i>

1482
00:58:57.334 --> 00:58:58.834
I'm sorry, I just wanted...

1483
00:58:58.836 --> 00:58:59.835
I wanted to ask you
one question.


1484
00:58:59.837 --> 00:59:01.169
<i>
- Yeah, okay.</i>

1485
00:59:01.171 --> 00:59:02.471
- Just, like,
one super-quick question.


1486
00:59:02.473 --> 00:59:03.839
Is that okay?

1487
00:59:03.841 --> 00:59:05.073
- Ah, okay.
Yeah, what's up?


1488
00:59:05.075 --> 00:59:07.008
- My question is...

1489
00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:08.276
Why wasn't it me?

1490
00:59:09.412 --> 00:59:10.912
- What?

1491
00:59:10.914 --> 00:59:14.983
- Like, all right,
we dated for four years,


1492
00:59:14.985 --> 00:59:18.220
and then we break up,
and it's, like, boom.


1493
00:59:18.222 --> 00:59:21.056
Now you're married with a kid,
and I'm just wondering,


1494
00:59:21.058 --> 00:59:24.760
you know,
why I wasn't that person.


1495
00:59:26.129 --> 00:59:27.929
- Uh, well,
if you remember, Kate,


1496
00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:29.865
you broke up with me.

1497
00:59:29.867 --> 00:59:32.267
- Yeah, no, I know.
I know.


1498
00:59:32.269 --> 00:59:33.935
I was just wondering...

1499
00:59:33.937 --> 00:59:35.804
<i>- and I don't know
if things have changed</i>


1500
00:59:35.806 --> 00:59:38.106
<i>in the last couple years,
but when we were together,</i>


1501
00:59:38.108 --> 00:59:40.475
<i>you weren't exactly
into marriage so much.</i>


1502
00:59:40.477 --> 00:59:43.211
That was...
- why do you say that?


1503
00:59:43.213 --> 00:59:45.247
- Okay, well,
the night at the restaurant


1504
00:59:45.249 --> 00:59:48.116
when I was gonna propose to you,
you ran out like crazy


1505
00:59:48.118 --> 00:59:50.786
when I was reaching
for my wallet.


1506
00:59:50.788 --> 00:59:52.287
- I know.

1507
00:59:52.289 --> 00:59:53.855
I thought... i thought you were
reaching for a ring.


1508
00:59:53.857 --> 00:59:56.024
<i>
- I know you did.</i>

1509
00:59:56.026 --> 00:59:57.826
<i>And that's why I didn't...
That's why I never asked you.</i>


1510
00:59:57.828 --> 01:00:01.329
Well, that and because you broke
up with me, like, a week later.


1511
01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:03.165
- Yeah, I know.
I mean, I know that.


1512
01:00:03.167 --> 01:00:04.900
I just, uh...

1513
01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:06.134
I didn't know
that you knew that.


1514
01:00:06.136 --> 01:00:07.569
<i>
- But it's fine, right?</i>

1515
01:00:07.571 --> 01:00:09.871
Everything worked out
like it was supposed to.


1516
01:00:11.974 --> 01:00:13.875
<i>I know we haven't...
We haven't talked in a while.</i>


1517
01:00:13.877 --> 01:00:15.043
<i>You okay?</i>

1518
01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:16.545
- Yeah, of course.

1519
01:00:16.547 --> 01:00:17.946
Of course.

1520
01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:20.282
And, um, hey,

1521
01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:23.151
I want you to know
that I'm really happy for you.


1522
01:00:23.153 --> 01:00:24.452
I just... i need you to know that.

1523
01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.388
I really,
really am happy for you.


1524
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:27.389
<i>
- Thanks, Kate.</i>

1525
01:00:27.391 --> 01:00:28.824
<i>Stay out of trouble.</i>

1526
01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:38.466
- Was that my voicemail?

1527
01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:39.868
- Oh, my god.
- I figured.


1528
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:41.069
There's something
I got to tell you,


1529
01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:42.938
which is...
Oh, geez.


1530
01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:45.006
She's taking this really hard.

1531
01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:46.441
She must be craving the raven.

1532
01:00:46.443 --> 01:00:48.243
- Oh, my god.

1533
01:00:48.245 --> 01:00:53.215
Did I just say that my love
is deeper than the ocean...


1534
01:00:53.217 --> 01:00:55.617
- Smoother than lotion.

1535
01:00:55.619 --> 01:00:57.219
It's a beautiful line.

1536
01:00:58.888 --> 01:01:00.522
Evie, I can't tell you
how excited I was


1537
01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:03.325
when I saw that invitation
in my Inbox.


1538
01:01:03.327 --> 01:01:05.160
- Yeah, it's really nice
to see everyone.


1539
01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:09.364
- Sort of validated the whole
divorce, all the drama.


1540
01:01:09.366 --> 01:01:11.366
- Excuse me?
What?


1541
01:01:11.368 --> 01:01:13.134
- Oh, Evie,

1542
01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:15.604
I've always known that we're
supposed to be together.


1543
01:01:15.606 --> 01:01:20.275
Even when I was married.

1544
01:01:20.277 --> 01:01:22.611
We're soul mates.

1545
01:01:22.613 --> 01:01:25.947
You're the Sandy to my Danny.

1546
01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:28.316
- That was a high school play.

1547
01:01:28.318 --> 01:01:30.919
- I just can't believe
it's happening now, you know?


1548
01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:33.221
Ah, she was so pissed
when I got the tattoo.


1549
01:01:33.223 --> 01:01:34.456
- Tattoo?

1550
01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:35.523
- Oh.

1551
01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.060
- Oh!
Wow!


1552
01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:40.395
That's me!
- Yeah.


1553
01:01:40.397 --> 01:01:41.496
That's your first headshot.

1554
01:01:41.498 --> 01:01:43.031
- That's my first headshot.

1555
01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:44.199
- First headshot, yeah.

1556
01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:46.635
- Yeah, it is.

1557
01:01:46.637 --> 01:01:49.971
- It's like you're resting
your head on my chest.


1558
01:01:54.278 --> 01:01:56.544
- Okay.

1559
01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.647
It's there.
You know what?


1560
01:01:58.649 --> 01:02:01.683
Um, Ben, I'm actually gonna
go check on the party,


1561
01:02:01.685 --> 01:02:04.619
which is just about over,
so you should probably go.


1562
01:02:04.621 --> 01:02:06.554
- Evie, we're meant to be.

1563
01:02:09.959 --> 01:02:11.693
Or...

1564
01:02:11.695 --> 01:02:12.994
Not to be.

1565
01:02:12.996 --> 01:02:14.362
- Uh-oh.

1566
01:02:14.364 --> 01:02:15.597
- That is the question.

1567
01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:17.299
- Oh, no.

1568
01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:19.968
- "Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer the slings


1569
01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:22.604
"and arrows
of outrageous fortune


1570
01:02:22.606 --> 01:02:24.673
"or to take arms against a sea
of troubles,


1571
01:02:24.675 --> 01:02:26.241
and by opposing end them."

1572
01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:27.609
- Okay, I'm gonna go, Ben.
Drive safe.


1573
01:02:27.611 --> 01:02:29.444
- "To sleep.

1574
01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:30.512
To"...

1575
01:02:33.616 --> 01:02:35.951
"to sleep.

1576
01:02:35.953 --> 01:02:37.185
"Ay, there's the rub!

1577
01:02:37.187 --> 01:02:39.087
For in that sleep of death,
what dream"...


1578
01:02:40.724 --> 01:02:41.723
- wow.

1579
01:02:41.725 --> 01:02:44.192
So, hey, how you holding up?

1580
01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:47.095
- "Partee tyme."

1581
01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:48.330
- Thanks for doing this, dude.

1582
01:02:48.332 --> 01:02:50.432
I mean, like,
this is really awesome.


1583
01:02:50.434 --> 01:02:52.701
- Yeah.
Not always a total screw-up.


1584
01:02:52.703 --> 01:02:55.537
- Wow, you, like, really sucked
down there, didn't you?


1585
01:02:57.074 --> 01:02:58.640
- Excuse me, I'm a grown woman.

1586
01:02:58.642 --> 01:03:00.575
I'm not here to take insults
from, like,


1587
01:03:00.577 --> 01:03:02.077
a 17-year-old high schooler.

1588
01:03:02.079 --> 01:03:04.079
- Okay, first of all, I'm 191/2,

1589
01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:06.014
and second of all, good for you.

1590
01:03:06.016 --> 01:03:08.416
I thought you were, like, some
loser freshman I didn't know.


1591
01:03:08.418 --> 01:03:09.985
Anyways, have you seen that
brunette hot girl


1592
01:03:09.987 --> 01:03:10.986
you were hanging out with?

1593
01:03:10.988 --> 01:03:12.220
She was... she was super hot.

1594
01:03:12.222 --> 01:03:14.589
- I think you mean
my girlfriend?


1595
01:03:14.591 --> 01:03:17.125
- Wait, that's your girlfriend?
- Yeah.


1596
01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:18.727
- Oh, wow, because if I had
one hour with her...


1597
01:03:18.729 --> 01:03:20.495
No, no, not even.

1598
01:03:20.497 --> 01:03:22.397
If I had just, like, ten minutes
with her, I'd be like,


1599
01:03:22.399 --> 01:03:24.065
"ooh, girl, you so naughty."

1600
01:03:24.067 --> 01:03:25.533
And I'd be like,
"ooh, what's up,<i>Mamí?"</i>


1601
01:03:25.535 --> 01:03:26.701
And then I'd be like,
"mm,<i>Mamí,</i> mm.


1602
01:03:26.703 --> 01:03:27.863
Give it to me.
Give it to me."


1603
01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.506
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1604
01:03:31.508 --> 01:03:32.668
I thought you were a Falafel.

1605
01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:36.011
- What is going on?

1606
01:03:36.013 --> 01:03:37.312
- Oh, you're so dead, dude.

1607
01:03:38.615 --> 01:03:40.081
Oh, my god.

1608
01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:41.216
I just hit a kid.

1609
01:03:41.218 --> 01:03:44.185
- He's 191/2, remember?

1610
01:03:44.187 --> 01:03:46.087
- I just knocked out a teenager.

1611
01:03:46.089 --> 01:03:47.222
- Okay, that's it!
That's it!


1612
01:03:47.224 --> 01:03:48.656
Cut the music!
Cut the music!


1613
01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:51.192
I need all of the children
to leave this party!


1614
01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:52.494
Do you hear me?

1615
01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:54.029
If you're in high school
and/or too young


1616
01:03:54.031 --> 01:03:56.564
to know who vanilla ice is,
you have 30 seconds


1617
01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:58.333
to get out of this party!

1618
01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:05.140
My carpet!

1619
01:04:05.142 --> 01:04:06.674
Who did this?

1620
01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.510
- This has Ashley Driscoll's
name written all over it.


1621
01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:10.045
- I don't think we can just
assume that Ashley did it.


1622
01:04:10.047 --> 01:04:11.546
- No, literally.

1623
01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:14.049
It says so right here
on the coozy.


1624
01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:15.550
- You know what?

1625
01:04:15.552 --> 01:04:18.620
Ashley Driscoll can eat shit.

1626
01:04:43.245 --> 01:04:44.679
- Homeless or hipster?

1627
01:04:44.681 --> 01:04:46.214
- What?

1628
01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:49.651
- I said homeless or hipster?

1629
01:04:51.154 --> 01:04:52.153
- Oh.

1630
01:04:52.155 --> 01:04:53.788
Yeah, totally hipster.

1631
01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:56.191
You know, I think he's in that
band the guidance counselors.


1632
01:04:56.193 --> 01:04:57.392
- Mm.

1633
01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:03.698
Thank you.

1634
01:05:20.684 --> 01:05:23.785
- You know, you guys, I'm so
glad we splurged on two-ply.


1635
01:05:23.787 --> 01:05:25.820
- I am having the best time

1636
01:05:25.822 --> 01:05:27.822
while simultaneously
feeling pretty bad


1637
01:05:27.824 --> 01:05:29.224
about being so wasteful.

1638
01:05:29.226 --> 01:05:30.492
- This is so cathartic.

1639
01:05:30.494 --> 01:05:31.493
- Yeah.

1640
01:05:31.495 --> 01:05:32.727
We're queens of the night!

1641
01:05:32.729 --> 01:05:34.562
- Screw you, Ashley Driscoll!

1642
01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:36.531
- I hate my husband!

1643
01:05:38.902 --> 01:05:40.401
- Whoa, dude.

1644
01:05:40.403 --> 01:05:41.769
- That's a little dramatic,
Evie,


1645
01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:42.904
even for you.

1646
01:05:43.873 --> 01:05:46.374
- It's true.

1647
01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:48.443
I hate him.

1648
01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:50.245
I hate his clothes.

1649
01:05:50.247 --> 01:05:52.480
I hate his narcissism.

1650
01:05:52.482 --> 01:05:53.648
I hate his family.

1651
01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:54.849
Oh, my god!

1652
01:05:54.851 --> 01:05:57.552
His family.

1653
01:05:57.554 --> 01:06:00.622
I don't want to go
cross-country skiing.


1654
01:06:00.624 --> 01:06:04.659
What I do want is a divorce.

1655
01:06:06.428 --> 01:06:07.495
- Really?

1656
01:06:09.265 --> 01:06:10.431
- Yeah.

1657
01:06:10.433 --> 01:06:12.167
Yes!

1658
01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:15.670
- Well, thank god
'cause we think he sucks.


1659
01:06:15.672 --> 01:06:17.505
- Yeah, it's, like,
the only thing we talk about


1660
01:06:17.507 --> 01:06:18.506
behind your back.

1661
01:06:18.508 --> 01:06:19.607
- Really?

1662
01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:20.742
- Yeah!
- He's the worst!


1663
01:06:20.744 --> 01:06:22.477
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, my god.


1664
01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:23.811
- Wait, you guys.

1665
01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.680
As long as we're
putting it out there,


1666
01:06:25.682 --> 01:06:27.916
I got something I need
to say too.


1667
01:06:27.918 --> 01:06:29.184
- Okay.

1668
01:06:32.388 --> 01:06:33.454
- I'm gay.

1669
01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:36.724
- I hate you.
- You're the worst.


1670
01:06:36.726 --> 01:06:37.959
- I hate you.

1671
01:06:37.961 --> 01:06:39.401
- What?
You guys just always guessed.


1672
01:06:40.297 --> 01:06:42.597
- Come in.

1673
01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:44.599
- It's kind of hard making it
up those stairs


1674
01:06:44.601 --> 01:06:47.302
with my eyes closed, obviously.

1675
01:06:47.304 --> 01:06:48.503
Can I open them?

1676
01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:50.705
- Open them, sad clown.

1677
01:06:56.646 --> 01:06:58.479
Holy crap.

1678
01:06:58.481 --> 01:07:00.248
- I want to bathe you.

1679
01:07:01.818 --> 01:07:03.952
- You're the strangest woman
I've ever met.


1680
01:07:05.989 --> 01:07:07.889
I think I love you.

1681
01:07:07.891 --> 01:07:08.990
Is that okay?

1682
01:07:09.993 --> 01:07:11.859
- Holy crap!

1683
01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.928
Okay, let me just...
God dang it.


1684
01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:17.932
The thing is with... these boots
are very difficult to take off.


1685
01:07:17.934 --> 01:07:19.701
Goth lifestyle is worth it
for the fashion,


1686
01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:21.402
but it's definitely
time consuming.


1687
01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:22.770
Crap!

1688
01:07:22.772 --> 01:07:23.871
Come on!

1689
01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:24.872
Come on!

1690
01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:25.940
Get off!

1691
01:07:25.942 --> 01:07:27.709
God, it's like a snow boot.

1692
01:07:27.711 --> 01:07:29.477
Jesus Christ!

1693
01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:30.878
God damn it!

1694
01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.880
It's just, like,
the force doesn't work


1695
01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.515
'cause then it chokes me.

1696
01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:35.617
I'll leave it on.

1697
01:07:35.619 --> 01:07:36.718
I'll leave it on.

1698
01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.886
Stay right there,
you sweet ViXen.


1699
01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:40.822
- Just drop it off.

1700
01:07:40.824 --> 01:07:42.457
- God damn it.
I'm sorry.


1701
01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:45.393
Get it off!
Come on!


1702
01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:46.628
Jesus!

1703
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:48.029
Oh, god.

1704
01:07:48.031 --> 01:07:49.030
- Hurry up.
- Oh, yeah!


1705
01:07:49.032 --> 01:07:50.632
Oh, oh, wait a minute.

1706
01:07:50.634 --> 01:07:52.634
Didn't take in the choker
into account.


1707
01:07:52.636 --> 01:07:54.736
Denise is not gonna be pleased
if this gets scratched.


1708
01:07:54.738 --> 01:07:56.271
- Who's Denise?

1709
01:07:56.273 --> 01:07:59.040
- Denise works at hot topic
in the mall.


1710
01:07:59.042 --> 01:08:01.609
Right next to the, uh...
Do you know Denise?


1711
01:08:01.611 --> 01:08:02.944
- Hey, Kate!

1712
01:08:02.946 --> 01:08:05.647
Are you ready for your birthday
baby dance?


1713
01:08:08.685 --> 01:08:10.318
- Please do not do that.

1714
01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.853
I'm gonna pee my pants.
I have to pee so bad.


1715
01:08:11.855 --> 01:08:12.887
- Just do it!

1716
01:08:12.889 --> 01:08:14.589
- What, just pee in the yard?

1717
01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:16.057
- Yeah, dude!
Why not?


1718
01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.426
- Okay.
Yeah.


1719
01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:20.028
I'm gonna... I'm just gonna go.

1720
01:08:24.534 --> 01:08:26.534
- Is, uh, your house
the white one with the columns?


1721
01:08:26.536 --> 01:08:27.869
- Mm-hmm.

1722
01:08:27.871 --> 01:08:30.371
- With the round hedges
and the maple trees?


1723
01:08:30.373 --> 01:08:31.639
- Mm-hmm.

1724
01:08:31.641 --> 01:08:33.541
- That are currently covered
in toilet paper?


1725
01:08:33.543 --> 01:08:34.609
- Mm-hmm.

1726
01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:35.610
What the what?

1727
01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:36.878
- I'm doing it!

1728
01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:37.879
- Wow!

1729
01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:39.580
- I'm peeing.

1730
01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:40.982
And I am really hydrated.

1731
01:08:40.984 --> 01:08:42.383
Good for me.

1732
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:48.089
Hi.

1733
01:08:49.092 --> 01:08:50.692
- Hey!

1734
01:08:50.694 --> 01:08:54.896
You little bitches get
yoursel... oh, my god.


1735
01:08:54.898 --> 01:08:57.632
It's turtle head and theaturd.

1736
01:08:57.634 --> 01:08:59.967
- Okay, you can't talk to them
like that, Ashley.


1737
01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:02.570
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Who's gonna stop me?


1738
01:09:02.572 --> 01:09:03.938
- Me.

1739
01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:08.009
Kate.

1740
01:09:10.713 --> 01:09:11.779
Braceface.

1741
01:09:14.384 --> 01:09:16.417
Braceface?

1742
01:09:16.419 --> 01:09:18.486
So what is up, ladies?

1743
01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:22.523
Oh, is this some sad little
revenge plan that I ruined?


1744
01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:23.991
Oh, you must feel like such a...

1745
01:09:24.994 --> 01:09:26.094
- oh, no!

1746
01:09:26.096 --> 01:09:28.463
- Oh, my god.
She just ate shit.


1747
01:09:28.465 --> 01:09:29.731
- Is she dead?

1748
01:09:29.733 --> 01:09:31.899
- We got to hide the body.

1749
01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:35.436
- Good-bye, bench girl.

1750
01:09:44.114 --> 01:09:45.546
Oh, god!

1751
01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:47.382
- Oh, that is bad!

1752
01:09:47.384 --> 01:09:48.383
That is really bad.

1753
01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:49.384
- Is it bad?

1754
01:09:49.386 --> 01:09:50.985
- Oh, mm.
Yep.


1755
01:09:50.987 --> 01:09:53.388
Your left lateral
incisor's completely cracked.


1756
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:54.555
- Is that bad?

1757
01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:56.057
- Well, it's irreparable damage,

1758
01:09:56.059 --> 01:09:57.825
which means immediate
tooth extraction.


1759
01:09:57.827 --> 01:09:59.761
- Ew, what does that mean?

1760
01:09:59.763 --> 01:10:01.596
- It means this sucker's coming
out right now.


1761
01:10:01.598 --> 01:10:02.964
What?

1762
01:10:02.966 --> 01:10:05.666
- She said that she needs
to pull your tooth out!


1763
01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:07.869
Do you understand?

1764
01:10:07.871 --> 01:10:08.870
- Yes, theaturd!

1765
01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:10.438
I'm not having a stroke!

1766
01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.906
- Okay, we'll talk about
the nickname later.


1767
01:10:11.908 --> 01:10:14.108
- Okay, um, I need
some gauze or, like,


1768
01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:16.577
grab some toilet paper,
and I need some pliers.


1769
01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:18.079
- Oh, there might be a toolkit
in the trunk.


1770
01:10:18.081 --> 01:10:19.580
- You know what?

1771
01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:22.617
You're a toolkit in the trunk,
Dan.


1772
01:10:22.619 --> 01:10:23.851
- What?
- Actually, yes, please.


1773
01:10:23.853 --> 01:10:25.052
Can you go look?
That'd be great.


1774
01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:26.187
Thank you.
- Okay.


1775
01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:27.889
- Hurry!
And I need the vodka.


1776
01:10:27.891 --> 01:10:29.490
- Why?
- 'Cause I need the vodka.


1777
01:10:29.492 --> 01:10:30.658
- Okay.
- Please!


1778
01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:31.659
- Here.
- Thank you.


1779
01:10:31.661 --> 01:10:32.860
Oh.
- Oh, my god.


1780
01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:33.861
- Yeah.
- Oh!


1781
01:10:33.863 --> 01:10:35.129
Awesome!
Yes!


1782
01:10:35.131 --> 01:10:36.564
Yes!

1783
01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:38.499
- Oh, my god, my teeth...
So much.


1784
01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:39.500
- All right.

1785
01:10:39.502 --> 01:10:40.835
Let's do this.

1786
01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:42.703
- Wait!
Do you know what you're doing?


1787
01:10:42.705 --> 01:10:43.838
- I sure hope so.

1788
01:10:49.945 --> 01:10:51.679
I did it!

1789
01:10:51.681 --> 01:10:53.448
- I did it!

1790
01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:54.582
I did it!

1791
01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:55.783
Whoa!

1792
01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:00.087
I didn't do it.
- Freeze!


1793
01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:03.658
Step away from the Asian girl!

1794
01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:06.561
Dispatch, I think we have
a hate crime in progress.


1795
01:11:06.563 --> 01:11:07.895
My sister, are you okay?

1796
01:11:17.841 --> 01:11:20.141
- Thanks so much for the ride.

1797
01:11:20.143 --> 01:11:21.642
- No problem.

1798
01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:24.679
Thanks so much for
kicking my ass in chess.


1799
01:11:24.681 --> 01:11:25.813
You're really good.

1800
01:11:25.815 --> 01:11:27.014
- Yeah, right.

1801
01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.855
Can I ask you a question?

1802
01:11:33.857 --> 01:11:35.623
- Yeah.

1803
01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:39.093
- I hope you don't take it
the wrong way, but...


1804
01:11:39.095 --> 01:11:40.728
Why do you go out with Derrick?

1805
01:11:43.099 --> 01:11:44.765
Sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything.


1806
01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:46.934
- No.

1807
01:11:46.936 --> 01:11:51.539
No, I ask myself that question
all the time.


1808
01:11:54.544 --> 01:11:57.178
I don't know.

1809
01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:59.614
He's the quarterback.

1810
01:11:59.616 --> 01:12:01.916
I'm the cheerleader.

1811
01:12:01.918 --> 01:12:05.286
It's what nature wants.

1812
01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:09.624
But I get what you're saying.

1813
01:12:09.626 --> 01:12:10.791
I shouldn't be dating someone

1814
01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:12.593
that I don't
really connect with.


1815
01:12:21.937 --> 01:12:23.571
- Um...

1816
01:12:23.573 --> 01:12:25.673
He... he's probably wondering
where you are.


1817
01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:27.308
I don't know if you want
to go in,


1818
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:29.544
give him a call or something.

1819
01:12:29.546 --> 01:12:31.212
Maybe that would, you know...

1820
01:12:31.214 --> 01:12:34.215
- I love this song.

1821
01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:38.953
- Do you guys have anyone
I can call for you?


1822
01:12:38.955 --> 01:12:40.788
A lawyer?
Anything?


1823
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:43.157
- Okay, don't pretend
to be a nice guy, Dan.


1824
01:12:43.159 --> 01:12:45.126
Yeah, we had a connection,
and yeah,


1825
01:12:45.128 --> 01:12:47.194
it's probably the liquor talking
that's making me say this,


1826
01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:50.097
but we probably could've been
something, and you blew it!


1827
01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:51.098
- You blew it!
- But...


1828
01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:53.134
- yeah, you blew it!

1829
01:12:53.136 --> 01:12:54.769
- Hi.
- Yeah, you totally blew it.


1830
01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:04.679
- Oh, um, hey, you...
You work for Charlie, right?


1831
01:13:04.681 --> 01:13:05.880
Where can I find her girlfriend?

1832
01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:07.748
- Uh, Claire left.
- What?


1833
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:10.818
- Yeah, she wasn't too stoked
about Charlie hulking out


1834
01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.787
back there, so she left.

1835
01:13:12.789 --> 01:13:15.790
She told me to let Charlie know,
but I haven't seen her.


1836
01:13:15.792 --> 01:13:18.225
- Uh, that's 'cause
she got arrested.


1837
01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:23.598
Oh, god!
- Oh, hey, Dan.


1838
01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.966
Hey, how's the retainer?

1839
01:13:24.968 --> 01:13:26.767
- It's good.
It's really tight.


1840
01:13:26.769 --> 01:13:27.969
Thank you.

1841
01:13:27.971 --> 01:13:29.370
I was just wondering if you knew

1842
01:13:29.372 --> 01:13:30.805
where Charlie's girlfriend,
Claire, is.


1843
01:13:30.807 --> 01:13:31.806
- Uh, no.

1844
01:13:31.808 --> 01:13:33.174
- What about Evie?

1845
01:13:33.176 --> 01:13:34.909
Does... does she have a boyfriend
I could call?


1846
01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:36.243
- She doesn't have a boyfriend.
She's married.


1847
01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:37.979
- Really?
- Yeah.


1848
01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:41.048
Yeah, her husband is, like,
some lawyer dude named Todd.


1849
01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:51.659
- I am gonna get this dipped
in gold and put it on a chain


1850
01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:53.361
- you know, for a minute there,
I really thought you were gonna


1851
01:13:53.363 --> 01:13:54.443
go in and get a second one.

1852
01:13:55.832 --> 01:13:57.064
It would've made
amazing earrings.


1853
01:13:57.066 --> 01:13:58.099
- Oh.
- I should've done it.


1854
01:13:58.101 --> 01:13:59.200
- Yeah.
- But you did it.


1855
01:13:59.202 --> 01:14:01.836
You finally... you pulled a tooth.

1856
01:14:01.838 --> 01:14:04.372
Now you can be, like,
a full orthodontist.


1857
01:14:04.374 --> 01:14:07.041
- Yeah, are you gonna
go back to school?


1858
01:14:07.043 --> 01:14:08.876
- You know what?

1859
01:14:08.878 --> 01:14:10.344
No.

1860
01:14:10.346 --> 01:14:12.346
- Really?
- Yeah!


1861
01:14:12.348 --> 01:14:14.782
I like my job.

1862
01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.651
It's low pressure,

1863
01:14:16.653 --> 01:14:18.152
and I have fun with Jules,

1864
01:14:18.154 --> 01:14:19.720
and I like it.

1865
01:14:19.722 --> 01:14:23.758
I'm not scared to do more.
I just like it.


1866
01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:24.759
You know what else?

1867
01:14:24.761 --> 01:14:27.328
I... i like my organized fun.

1868
01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:30.297
Like, I don't need to go out
to have a good time.


1869
01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:31.966
You know what I think I do?

1870
01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:35.236
I put all this pressure
on myself because I just assume


1871
01:14:35.238 --> 01:14:38.706
that other people expect me
to be more or to want more


1872
01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:40.975
'cause I'm, like,
an assistant who's a homebody,


1873
01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:42.276
but I love it!

1874
01:14:42.278 --> 01:14:44.245
- Amen.
- Get it.


1875
01:14:44.247 --> 01:14:46.914
- I want to be the weird aunt.

1876
01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:48.716
I do.
- Whoa.


1877
01:14:48.718 --> 01:14:50.184
This got serious.

1878
01:14:50.186 --> 01:14:51.852
- Yeah, and speaking
of serious...


1879
01:14:51.854 --> 01:14:53.320
Sorry, are you done
with your speech?


1880
01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:54.322
- Yeah, I am.
Thank you.


1881
01:14:55.358 --> 01:14:57.158
Unnecessary.
- Got it.


1882
01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.226
Speaking of serious,
I'm gonna be in serious trouble


1883
01:14:59.228 --> 01:15:01.462
with Claire if we end up
spending the night here.


1884
01:15:01.464 --> 01:15:04.298
- No, you won't
because Claire is cool.


1885
01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:06.734
- Yeah, she is cool.

1886
01:15:06.736 --> 01:15:10.071
She's a cool fiancée.

1887
01:15:10.073 --> 01:15:11.338
What?

1888
01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.473
Seriously?
- Yeah.


1889
01:15:12.475 --> 01:15:14.809
- Oh, my god!
- What?


1890
01:15:14.811 --> 01:15:15.976
That's amazing!

1891
01:15:15.978 --> 01:15:17.078
- Wait, why didn't you tell us?

1892
01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.779
- I don't know.

1893
01:15:18.781 --> 01:15:20.181
'Cause you guys are, like,
having nervous breakdowns


1894
01:15:20.183 --> 01:15:21.182
or whatever.

1895
01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:22.450
- Congratulations.

1896
01:15:22.452 --> 01:15:24.051
- Yeah, thank you,
but I really need to guys


1897
01:15:24.053 --> 01:15:25.720
to act surprised when Claire
and I tell you together.


1898
01:15:25.722 --> 01:15:27.154
- I'm an actress.

1899
01:15:27.156 --> 01:15:29.056
- Okay.
- Got it.


1900
01:15:29.058 --> 01:15:30.825
- Also, I can throw you
an engagement party.


1901
01:15:30.827 --> 01:15:32.126
- Oh, my god.

1902
01:15:32.128 --> 01:15:33.227
No thank you.

1903
01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:30.351
Kinsey.

1904
01:16:30.353 --> 01:16:33.154
Kinsey.

1905
01:16:33.156 --> 01:16:34.188
Hi.

1906
01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:35.823
- Hi.

1907
01:16:35.825 --> 01:16:38.125
We must've fallen asleep
when we were talking.


1908
01:16:38.127 --> 01:16:41.395
- Yeah, I g...
Yeah.


1909
01:16:41.397 --> 01:16:43.931
Um...
- That was really fun.


1910
01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:47.034
- It was.
Last night was really fun.


1911
01:16:47.036 --> 01:16:48.803
Um...

1912
01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:56.443
It's fine.
I'm, uh...


1913
01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:57.812
I'm gonna talk to him.

1914
01:16:57.814 --> 01:16:58.813
It's fine.

1915
01:16:58.815 --> 01:17:00.915
- Hey, Kinsey.

1916
01:17:00.917 --> 01:17:03.184
If we don't talk again
at school, or ever again,


1917
01:17:03.186 --> 01:17:04.385
for that matter,
I just want to let you know


1918
01:17:04.387 --> 01:17:05.586
that I really like you

1919
01:17:05.588 --> 01:17:06.954
and the reason I invited you
is because...


1920
01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:08.055
- Oliver.
Oliver.


1921
01:17:08.057 --> 01:17:09.123
- Yeah?

1922
01:17:11.359 --> 01:17:13.327
- I'm gonna handle this.

1923
01:17:14.396 --> 01:17:18.132
But, yeah,
just message me later.


1924
01:17:18.134 --> 01:17:19.166
- Okay.
- Okay?


1925
01:17:19.168 --> 01:17:21.435
- All right.
- Okay.


1926
01:17:21.437 --> 01:17:22.503
Okay.

1927
01:17:29.512 --> 01:17:31.579
- Wake up, ladies!

1928
01:17:31.581 --> 01:17:34.014
I got good news
and I got bad news.


1929
01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:35.616
- We will take
the good news please.


1930
01:17:35.618 --> 01:17:37.351
- I didn't ask
for your preference.


1931
01:17:37.353 --> 01:17:39.386
The bad news is
you're probably gonna get


1932
01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:41.889
community service
for trespassing.


1933
01:17:41.891 --> 01:17:42.890
- That's not that bad.

1934
01:17:42.892 --> 01:17:45.159
- And public urination.

1935
01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:47.328
The good news is
your lawyer's here.


1936
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:48.462
He's gonna get you out of here.

1937
01:17:48.464 --> 01:17:49.630
- Our lawyer?

1938
01:17:49.632 --> 01:17:51.465
- Todd Jones.

1939
01:17:53.501 --> 01:17:55.202
- Let's do this.

1940
01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:03.544
- Thank you.

1941
01:18:05.981 --> 01:18:07.014
Hi, Todd.
- Mm-mm.


1942
01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:08.082
- Okay.

1943
01:18:12.387 --> 01:18:14.889
- Evie, what did you do?

1944
01:18:14.891 --> 01:18:16.257
- I'm fine, Todd.

1945
01:18:16.259 --> 01:18:18.158
Thank you for asking.

1946
01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.560
Why aren't you in vail?

1947
01:18:19.562 --> 01:18:22.229
- Well, some guy named Dan
calls me,


1948
01:18:22.231 --> 01:18:24.231
tells me
that you've been arrested,


1949
01:18:24.233 --> 01:18:27.268
so I take the first flight back.

1950
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:30.070
I... i can't believe this.

1951
01:18:30.072 --> 01:18:34.308
Do you have any idea
how bad this makes me look?


1952
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:35.910
- And that's what
you're concerned about.


1953
01:18:35.912 --> 01:18:37.945
Okay.
- Yes, Evie.


1954
01:18:37.947 --> 01:18:41.415
Well, I'm a lawyer, so I can't
be bailing people out of jail.


1955
01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:44.685
- I spent the night
in the drunk tank.


1956
01:18:44.687 --> 01:18:47.121
- I don't ask for a lot.

1957
01:18:47.123 --> 01:18:49.323
I let you do your little
work stuff.


1958
01:18:49.325 --> 01:18:53.527
I let you hang out
with those two idiots.


1959
01:18:53.529 --> 01:18:55.596
But at the end of the day,

1960
01:18:55.598 --> 01:18:59.333
I'm the one
who takes care of you.


1961
01:18:59.335 --> 01:19:03.504
- What if I don't need someone
to take care of me?


1962
01:19:03.506 --> 01:19:07.508
What if I can take care of
myself?


1963
01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:16.050
- Whoa!
- Oh, god.


1964
01:19:16.052 --> 01:19:17.484
You know,
prison is not comfortable.


1965
01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:18.585
- Hi!

1966
01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:19.586
She gave me a weird look.

1967
01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:21.422
God.

1968
01:19:21.424 --> 01:19:23.190
- My girlfriend's a criminal!

1969
01:19:25.461 --> 01:19:26.660
- Gonna give you a minute.

1970
01:19:26.662 --> 01:19:28.562
- Yeah, thanks.

1971
01:19:40.710 --> 01:19:42.643
- I am so sorry
about last night.


1972
01:19:42.645 --> 01:19:44.378
- You're a god damn maniac.

1973
01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:45.713
- True.

1974
01:19:45.715 --> 01:19:49.350
But for good reason.

1975
01:19:49.352 --> 01:19:51.719
- Peter Finch, athletic director
at Lincoln high school?


1976
01:19:51.721 --> 01:19:53.487
- I told Peter
that if I made him look like


1977
01:19:53.489 --> 01:19:55.422
a total badass at the party
last night,


1978
01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:57.458
that he'd have to give me
the entire uniform account


1979
01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:59.059
of Lincoln high.

1980
01:19:59.061 --> 01:20:00.527
Huh?
It's not bad.


1981
01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:03.697
- You stink real bad.

1982
01:20:03.699 --> 01:20:05.366
- I was in prison.
- Oh.


1983
01:20:05.368 --> 01:20:07.167
- I learned all sorts of shit.
- Oh.


1984
01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:08.235
- Hi.

1985
01:20:08.237 --> 01:20:10.337
- Hey, there.

1986
01:20:10.339 --> 01:20:13.007
- So just so you know,
I drove Ashley home


1987
01:20:13.009 --> 01:20:14.341
so she wouldn't drive drunk.

1988
01:20:14.343 --> 01:20:17.344
- Yeah, no, you do not
have to explain yourself.


1989
01:20:17.346 --> 01:20:19.480
I got crazy last night.

1990
01:20:19.482 --> 01:20:21.315
- A little crazy
is when a bachelorette party


1991
01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:22.316
hires a stripper.

1992
01:20:22.318 --> 01:20:23.684
- Oh.

1993
01:20:23.686 --> 01:20:25.085
- You ripped a tooth
out of a woman's jaw.


1994
01:20:25.087 --> 01:20:26.687
- Yeah, I did that.

1995
01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:28.055
- Yeah, you did.

1996
01:20:28.057 --> 01:20:29.456
- Didn't know
I was such a badass.


1997
01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:30.758
- Uh, no, I did not know that.

1998
01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:35.362
- Can I give you a ride?

1999
01:20:35.364 --> 01:20:38.632
- Actually, do you want to grab
some breakfast?


2000
01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:41.535
- Are you asking me on a date?

2001
01:20:41.537 --> 01:20:42.770
- Are you scared?

2002
01:20:45.207 --> 01:20:46.373
- Evie, can you just relax?

2003
01:20:46.375 --> 01:20:47.674
- Nope.

2004
01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:49.143
- No, are... you're seriously
gonna do this?


2005
01:20:49.145 --> 01:20:51.111
- Yes.
Hey, guys, can I grab a ride?


2006
01:20:51.113 --> 01:20:52.646
- Oh, all right.
Well, sounds good then.


2007
01:20:52.648 --> 01:20:54.748
You just... you take a few nights
to cool off.


2008
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:56.316
I'll stay with my parents.

2009
01:20:56.318 --> 01:20:58.519
- Wait.
Where are your parents?


2010
01:20:59.722 --> 01:21:01.722
- I dropped them off
on my way here.


2011
01:21:11.499 --> 01:21:13.133
- Oh, are you guys the butlers?

2012
01:21:13.135 --> 01:21:15.202
Oh, we'll have two full
English breakfasts please,


2013
01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:17.204
and I'll take my bacon
nice and crispy.


2014
01:21:17.206 --> 01:21:18.372
And did you want to add
something?


2015
01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:20.107
- Scotch.
- Just a scotch for her.


2016
01:21:23.446 --> 01:21:26.580
<i>
- Dear 30-year-old Kate,</i>

<i>He'll be handsome

2021
01:21:34.356 --> 01:21:35.355
How's the sangria?

2022
01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:36.557
- It's nice.

2023
01:21:36.559 --> 01:21:37.758
- Yeah?
- Just your type of sangria.


2024
01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.426
- It's so strong, by the way.

2025
01:21:39.428 --> 01:21:41.395
<i>You'll be
a super successful orthodontist</i>

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:45.232
I got it dipped in gold.

2029
01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:46.500
- Oh, my god.
- You really did it.


2030
01:21:46.502 --> 01:21:48.368
- I know.
It looks awesome, right?


2031
01:21:48.370 --> 01:21:50.871
<i>Of course, there's gonna be
a little one to take care of</i>


2032
01:21:50.873 --> 01:21:52.739
<i>or at least a bun in the oven.</i>

2033
01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:54.541
- Hi.
Hello.


2034
01:21:54.543 --> 01:21:57.211
<i>- 30-year-old self,

2036
01:21:58.814 --> 01:22:00.614

Kate.


2037
01:22:00.616 --> 01:22:01.615
<i>- I'll see you...</i>
- Kate.


2038
01:22:01.617 --> 01:22:02.649
- Hmm?
- Hi.


2039
01:22:02.651 --> 01:22:03.650
Did you hear what we said?

2040
01:22:03.652 --> 01:22:05.652
- What?

2041
01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:08.255
- We're engaged.

2042
01:22:09.625 --> 01:22:11.592
Oh, my god!

2043
01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:13.193
- So unexpected!
- Wow.


2044
01:22:13.195 --> 01:22:14.695
Yeah.

2045
01:22:14.697 --> 01:22:16.864
Wow.
- Big news.


2046
01:22:16.866 --> 01:22:18.265
