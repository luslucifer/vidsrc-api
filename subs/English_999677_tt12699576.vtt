[gentle melodic music]

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:20.895
[rocks rumbling]
[soft eerie music]

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.336
[thunder rumbling]

5
00:00:33.608 --> 00:00:36.911
[soft orchestral music]

6
00:00:49.223 --> 00:00:50.723
[fire crackling]

7
00:00:50.725 --> 00:00:55.160
- Back in 1978, there
was a terrible fire here.


8
00:00:55.162 --> 00:00:57.231
Some kids left a campfire alone,

9
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.534
winds picked up and
it started to grow.


10
00:01:01.536 --> 00:01:03.268
Fire rangers were called in,

11
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.370
but by that time
it was too late.


12
00:01:05.372 --> 00:01:07.974
The fire spread
through the forest


13
00:01:07.976 --> 00:01:11.376
burning everything in its path.

14
00:01:11.378 --> 00:01:14.179
They dug into the ground
as their last hope.


15
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:17.450
One of the rangers, a
man named Warren Copper,


16
00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:21.088
started chopping a tree,
trying to start a fire line.


17
00:01:22.991 --> 00:01:26.026
The heat from the
fire at his head


18
00:01:27.127 --> 00:01:29.662
[gentle tense music]
was 5,000 degrees!


19
00:01:29.664 --> 00:01:32.364
His skin began

20
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:35.269
to blister and boil.

21
00:01:37.037 --> 00:01:40.473
His arm and head's
caught on fire. [laughs]


22
00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:42.107
Still, he kept chopping.

23
00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:43.509
- Bullshit! [coughing]

24
00:01:43.511 --> 00:01:45.043
- After the fire passed,

25
00:01:45.045 --> 00:01:49.015
all they could find was
Warren's charred skeleton.


26
00:01:49.017 --> 00:01:51.349
[soft tense music]
[fire crackling]


27
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:54.720
Years later, locals claimed
to see this strange figure


28
00:01:54.722 --> 00:01:57.456
with a skull for a head

29
00:01:57.458 --> 00:01:59.059
carrying an ax,

30
00:02:00.427 --> 00:02:02.764
guarding the woods in
the middle of the night.


31
00:02:03.698 --> 00:02:05.297
[soft intense music]

32
00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.368
So if you're stupid enough
to leave a campfire alone,


33
00:02:09.804 --> 00:02:11.204
you'd better run,

34
00:02:12.272 --> 00:02:15.409
because Warren Copper
will come for you.


35
00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:21.381
So if you wanna stay alive
this summer, remember this.


36
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.988
Only you can prevent
forest fires.


37
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.061
Argh!
[soft ominous music]


38
00:02:35.063 --> 00:02:38.163
- Nice story.
- Why, what's wrong with that?


39
00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:40.733
- I assume Warren's okay
with you using his name?


40
00:02:40.735 --> 00:02:42.367
- Ah, I took some liberties.

41
00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:45.203
- Yeah, if you keep teasing
him like that, you're gonna be.


42
00:02:45.205 --> 00:02:47.573
- Who's Warren Copper?

43
00:02:47.575 --> 00:02:49.240
- Who's Warren Copper?

44
00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:51.077
- Yeah, like what's his deal?

45
00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.379
- What's his deal?

46
00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:58.618
Well, some people say he
chopped up his entire family.


47
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.218
Left them for dead.

48
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.090
- Dipshit, if he chopped up
his family, they would be dead.


49
00:03:04.092 --> 00:03:05.591
Stupid.
[campers laughing]


50
00:03:05.593 --> 00:03:08.527
- Warren's the groundskeeper
here, mainly keeps to himself.


51
00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:10.295
If you need any
repairs on your cabin


52
00:03:10.297 --> 00:03:12.498
this summer, he's your guy.

53
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.901
Look, for tonight, just
relax, introduce yourselves,


54
00:03:15.903 --> 00:03:17.204
you're gonna fit right in.

55
00:03:19.172 --> 00:03:21.241
You two, go get some firewood.

56
00:03:23.945 --> 00:03:25.278
- I'll be back.

57
00:03:26.313 --> 00:03:29.450
[gentle tense music]

58
00:03:31.351 --> 00:03:34.620
- Hey, I'm gonna go back and
see if Tina needs any help.


59
00:03:34.622 --> 00:03:36.656
- [Barry] I'm not taking
this shit back for myself.


60
00:03:36.658 --> 00:03:38.457
- I'll hold your
beer for you, man.


61
00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:39.725
- Dude.

62
00:03:39.727 --> 00:03:41.393
- Hey, why don't you ask
Warren Copper for help?


63
00:03:41.395 --> 00:03:43.361
He's out here,
isn't he? [laughing]


64
00:03:43.363 --> 00:03:44.465
- You know, you suck.

65
00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.269
[eerie tense music]

66
00:04:00.347 --> 00:04:01.214
Steve?

67
00:04:04.585 --> 00:04:05.853
Yo, Steve.

68
00:04:10.024 --> 00:04:12.591
You know, I know karate.

69
00:04:12.593 --> 00:04:14.162
Third degree black belt.

70
00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:19.999
All right.

71
00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:21.836
You wanna see how it feels like?

72
00:04:23.571 --> 00:04:27.173
Dude, dude, there's a
killer in the forest!


73
00:04:27.175 --> 00:04:30.377
Holy shit, I said there's
a killer in the forest!


74
00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:35.650
I said there's a
killer in the forest!


75
00:04:40.455 --> 00:04:41.887
Whatever.

76
00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.892

[gentle tense music]

79
00:04:59.574 --> 00:05:00.773
Warren?

80
00:05:00.775 --> 00:05:03.678
[gentle tense music]

81
00:05:17.324 --> 00:05:19.825
[tense music]

00:05:19.827 --> 00:05:21.060
Shit, oh!

[blow thudding]
Uh! [groaning]

[tense ominous music]

87
00:05:53.027 --> 00:05:54.160
No!

88
00:05:54.162 --> 00:05:55.426
No, no!

89
00:05:55.428 --> 00:05:56.329
[blow thudding]

90
00:06:00.635 --> 00:06:02.001
- [Dispatch] Is there a
medical unit on the air?


91
00:06:02.003 --> 00:06:03.569
This is Dispatch.

92
00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:05.938
[soft tense music]

93
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.206
Head unit from Dispatch,

94
00:06:07.208 --> 00:06:09.143
when you have time,
head to the coroner.


95
00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:12.745
- [Officer] You're up.

96
00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:15.748
[police radio

97

[gentle tense music]

98
00:06:18.152 --> 00:06:19.952
- What are you gonna say?

99
00:06:19.954 --> 00:06:20.753
Lex?

100
00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:22.221
[door thudding]

101
00:06:22.223 --> 00:06:24.422
- They're rolling up now.
- Keep everyone back.


102
00:06:24.424 --> 00:06:25.825
This isn't gonna go well.

103
00:06:25.827 --> 00:06:27.293
[gentle tense music]

104
00:06:27.295 --> 00:06:30.865
[typewriter keys tapping]

105
00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:33.032

[door thudding]

108
00:06:40.975 --> 00:06:43.008
- [Peter] Hey, is
that Mason's dad?


109
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.645
- No, that's his grandpa, Mason
doesn't live with his dad.


110
00:06:46.647 --> 00:06:48.013
- Not anymore.

111
00:06:48.015 --> 00:06:48.981
[hand slapping]
Ow!


112
00:06:48.983 --> 00:06:50.216
- What's wrong with you?

113
00:06:50.218 --> 00:06:51.016
- [Linnea] I'm sure
you can understand


114
00:06:51.018 --> 00:06:53.020
how difficult this is.

115
00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.193
I heard it from Mike, now
I need to hear it from you.


116
00:07:01.095 --> 00:07:02.795
- We were on the trail.

117
00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:06.999
[gentle tense music]

118
00:07:07.001 --> 00:07:09.367
We stopped for a
water break, I...


119
00:07:09.369 --> 00:07:12.838
[gentle tense music]

120
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.610
When we left, I thought
everyone was with us, I...


121
00:07:16.477 --> 00:07:20.079
[gentle tense music]

122
00:07:20.081 --> 00:07:21.780
I looked back, I...

123
00:07:21.782 --> 00:07:24.785
[soft eerie music]

124
00:07:28.522 --> 00:07:29.622
Mason.

125
00:07:29.624 --> 00:07:32.593
[soft eerie music]

126
00:07:39.767 --> 00:07:41.600
- This camp has
been in my family


127
00:07:41.602 --> 00:07:43.304
for as long as I can remember.

128
00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:46.340
It was my father's legacy

129
00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:49.275
and this incident

130
00:07:49.277 --> 00:07:52.578
is not going to tarnish that.

131
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.316
[soft tense music]

132
00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:00.386
I want your incident
report filled out


133
00:08:00.388 --> 00:08:02.990
and on my desk on Sunday night.

134
00:08:06.294 --> 00:08:09.997
Now, [sighing] if
you'll let yourself out,


135
00:08:13.634 --> 00:08:15.369
I have to speak with the family.

136
00:08:16.237 --> 00:08:18.003
[soft ominous music]

[police radio

138
00:08:19.607 --> 00:08:20.875
- What did you tell her?

139
00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:24.576
Lex, what did you say?

140
00:08:24.578 --> 00:08:28.013
[soft ominous music]

141
00:08:28.015 --> 00:08:30.215
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing.


142
00:08:30.217 --> 00:08:31.083
- What are you staring at?

143
00:08:31.085 --> 00:08:32.217
- I'm sorry.

144
00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:34.119
- Hey, hey hold on.
- Hey, hey!


145
00:08:34.121 --> 00:08:35.387
- Ow, man, no!
- Hold on.


146
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:36.722
- Get off.
- You don't wanna do this.


147
00:08:36.724 --> 00:08:38.090
- Come on, get up.
- No!


148
00:08:38.092 --> 00:08:40.759
- Get up, get out the way.
[Warren sobbing]


149
00:08:40.761 --> 00:08:43.329
[soft tense music]
- No.

[Warren sobbing]

151
00:08:48.135 --> 00:08:49.535
- Mike, are you okay?

152
00:08:49.537 --> 00:08:51.505
- Guy just attacks me,
they won't do anything.


153
00:08:53.607 --> 00:08:55.007
Nothing?

154
00:08:55.009 --> 00:08:56.909
Jeez, guys.
- Mike.

[soft tense music]

157
00:09:04.785 --> 00:09:06.352
- I can't believe he's here.

158
00:09:06.354 --> 00:09:08.487
- You know that guy?

159
00:09:08.489 --> 00:09:09.657
- [Dougie] Warren Copper.

160
00:09:11.726 --> 00:09:14.862
[gentle tense music]

161
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.810
- They took my boy. [sobbing]

162
00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:33.712
They took my boy.

163
00:09:33.714 --> 00:09:35.649
- Come on, Warren, come on.

164
00:09:37.518 --> 00:09:39.885

That first summer,
we lost two campers.

Before I worked at the

I lost a lot over there.

a lot of nightmares,

tell if they were real
