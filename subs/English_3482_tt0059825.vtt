1
00:01:17.397 --> 00:01:19.099
<i>Achtung</i>!

2
00:03:24.524 --> 00:03:27.693
It was in the Clouvet
collection, wasn't it?


3
00:03:27.694 --> 00:03:29.111
It was.

4
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.233
- Do you like it?
- Need you ask?


5
00:03:47.881 --> 00:03:50.504
This is degenerate art, you know.

6
00:03:51.718 --> 00:03:55.263
As a loyal officer of the Third
Reich, I should detest it.


7
00:03:57.057 --> 00:04:00.559
I've often wondered at the curious
conceit that would attempt


8
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.560
to determine tastes
and ideas by decree.


9
00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.695
Many times over the past four
years I have wanted to thank you.


10
00:04:11.696 --> 00:04:14.824
For not being what you'd expected?

11
00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:18.450
For saving all this. 
Protecting it.

12
00:04:19.287 --> 00:04:25.039
Do you feel free to thank me now because
the liberation of Paris is so close?


13
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.912
Perhaps.

14
00:04:27.754 --> 00:04:31.754
- It's not necessary.
- I could have been sent away.


15
00:04:32.676 --> 00:04:35.880
Someone else brought in to
be in charge of the museum.


16
00:04:40.392 --> 00:04:42.390
Perhaps I should thank you.

17
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.722
I was foolish.

18
00:04:46.356 --> 00:04:48.775
I knew of books being burned.

19
00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:50.811
Other things.

20
00:04:55.073 --> 00:04:57.783
I was terrified that
these would be lost.


21
00:04:57.784 --> 00:05:00.369
A book is worth a few francs.

22
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.873
We Germans can afford
to destroy those.


23
00:05:03.874 --> 00:05:08.961
We all may not appreciate artistic
merit, but cash value is another matter.


24
00:05:08.962 --> 00:05:11.589
You won't convince me
that you're cynical.


25
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.420
I know what these
paintings mean to you.


26
00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.343
You are a perceptive woman.

27
00:05:24.394 --> 00:05:26.016
We're removing the paintings.

28
00:05:26.646 --> 00:05:29.648
- Pack them carefully.
- Where are you taking them?


29
00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:33.819
- To a safe place.
- But no place is as safe as Paris.


30
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.399
The city has been declared open.
It won't be bombed or shelled.


31
00:05:38.742 --> 00:05:40.194
Captain.

32
00:05:40.994 --> 00:05:45.825
I want these at the station tomorrow,
crated and ready to be put on the train.


33
00:08:06.598 --> 00:08:10.268
- What about my train?
- It has been canceled, sir.


34
00:08:12.145 --> 00:08:14.439
- Who canceled it?
- I did.


35
00:08:14.481 --> 00:08:17.775
- Who are you?
- Labiche, Colonel. Area Inspector.


36
00:08:17.776 --> 00:08:20.320
Under my supervision, of course.

37
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:25.949
Since when does a Frenchman have the
authority to cancel a German train?


38
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.494
We're making up a special
armament train, Colonel.


39
00:08:28.495 --> 00:08:29.947
Highest priority.

40
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.124
- Whose orders?
- Von Rundstedt.


41
00:08:34.125 --> 00:08:36.544
Military Commander, 
Western Front.

42
00:08:39.798 --> 00:08:42.376
How soon can my train
be cleared to leave?


43
00:08:44.135 --> 00:08:48.010
As soon as I get another order.
It's your army, Colonel, not mine.


44
00:08:48.431 --> 00:08:52.556
You'll get the order. Have the train
ready this afternoon at 3.30.


45
00:09:05.281 --> 00:09:07.074
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.


46
00:09:29.264 --> 00:09:31.390
I'm calling for General Von Lubitz.

47
00:09:31.391 --> 00:09:34.726
I want the line for the
Field Command Headquarters.


48
00:09:34.727 --> 00:09:36.099
Yes, immediately!

49
00:09:37.856 --> 00:09:41.275
Field Command Headquarters?
General Von Lubitz's office calling.


50
00:09:41.276 --> 00:09:42.944
Colonel Muller, please.

51
00:10:03.256 --> 00:10:05.048
I tried to reach you,
Colonel Von Waldheim.


52
00:10:05.049 --> 00:10:08.468
The general canceled all appointments
not dealing with the evacuation of Paris.


53
00:10:08.469 --> 00:10:09.887
- Is he in? Alone?
- Yes, Colonel,


54
00:10:09.888 --> 00:10:11.886
but I have orders not
to let anyone in...


55
00:10:20.857 --> 00:10:24.652
- What is it, Colonel?
- A train I ordered was canceled.


56
00:10:25.612 --> 00:10:29.658
I've been advised your personal
authorization is now required.


57
00:10:30.742 --> 00:10:33.118
Signal from General
Von Rundstedt, sir.


58
00:10:33.119 --> 00:10:37.745
The highway between Avranches and
Mortain has been cut by the Americans.


59
00:10:40.877 --> 00:10:44.251
You can make application
through normal channels.


60
00:10:44.464 --> 00:10:47.257
You once said normal
channels were a trap,


61
00:10:47.258 --> 00:10:50.632
in which to snare officers
who lacked initiative.


62
00:10:56.684 --> 00:10:58.557
What's your cargo?

63
00:11:13.952 --> 00:11:16.662
I don't share your
enthusiasm for art.


64
00:11:16.663 --> 00:11:21.750
Even if I did, it would not be
centered on this degenerate trash.


65
00:11:21.751 --> 00:11:25.797
Nor would I expect priority over
vitally needed war transport.


66
00:11:26.422 --> 00:11:28.215
Good morning, Colonel.

67
00:11:29.926 --> 00:11:33.762
The second SS armored division
has fallen back towards Falaise.


68
00:11:33.763 --> 00:11:36.887
Report on their remaining
effective strength.


69
00:11:38.059 --> 00:11:44.062
Might it not be unwise to leave a billion
gold reichsmarks in the Bank of France?


70
00:11:44.524 --> 00:11:47.568
Enough money to equip
ten panzer divisions?


71
00:11:53.491 --> 00:11:55.284
Make your point, Colonel.

72
00:11:55.285 --> 00:11:57.579
Money is a weapon.

73
00:11:59.122 --> 00:12:04.374
The contents of that train are as
negotiable as gold, and more valuable.


74
00:12:05.086 --> 00:12:09.132
I feel Berlin would prefer it in
the hands of the Third Reich.


75
00:12:27.608 --> 00:12:28.692
I must warn you, Colonel.

76
00:12:28.693 --> 00:12:32.943
If conditions at the front become more
critical, I will rescind this authorization.


77
00:12:55.887 --> 00:12:57.304
When will you be ready?

78
00:12:57.305 --> 00:13:00.634
Train will be ready to leave
tomorrow morning at 9:15, Major.


79
00:13:35.802 --> 00:13:37.629
Come in. Come in.

80
00:13:45.686 --> 00:13:49.481
This is Mademoiselle Villard from
the Jeu de Paume, the museum.


81
00:13:49.482 --> 00:13:51.104
I brought her with me.

82
00:14:00.785 --> 00:14:03.328
Mademoiselle Villard has a problem.

83
00:14:03.329 --> 00:14:07.082
- I thought your group might help her.
- It's not to help me.


84
00:14:07.083 --> 00:14:11.038
You understand? The
paintings belong to France.


85
00:14:11.671 --> 00:14:15.298
- Paintings?
- The train you are preparing for the Colonel.


86
00:14:15.299 --> 00:14:17.551
He's stealing a load of pictures.

87
00:14:17.552 --> 00:14:20.722
You should hear what they're worth!

88
00:14:21.347 --> 00:14:24.599
- It's not just the money.
- What does she want us to do?


89
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.854
- She wants us to blow up the train.
- Oh, no! No, you misunderstand.


90
00:14:28.855 --> 00:14:33.275
They must not even be damaged.
They could never be replaced.


91
00:14:33.276 --> 00:14:36.400
They're not just...
Here, I have the list.


92
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:44.367
Renoirs, CÃ©zannes, 64
Picassos, 29 Braques.


93
00:14:44.871 --> 00:14:46.538
Degas, Matisse.

94
00:14:46.539 --> 00:14:51.877
He chose very carefully. Only
the best. The national heritage.


95
00:14:51.878 --> 00:14:55.547
- What do you want us to do, madame?
- Mademoiselle.


96
00:14:55.548 --> 00:14:59.343
Well, I thought, perhaps, if
you could just stop the train.


97
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.890
Stopping the train is not
simple, mademoiselle.


98
00:15:04.891 --> 00:15:08.393
- You can get killed stopping a train.
- Especially if you are French,


99
00:15:08.394 --> 00:15:10.596
and the train is German.

100
00:15:11.105 --> 00:15:13.933
I know. I realize.

101
00:15:15.401 --> 00:15:18.775
But soon Paris will be
free, isn't that true?


102
00:15:20.364 --> 00:15:22.532
But if the paintings
are not here...


103
00:15:22.533 --> 00:15:26.036
Our latest report is that the Allies
will be in Paris within a week.


104
00:15:26.037 --> 00:15:28.121
Maybe three or four days.

105
00:15:28.122 --> 00:15:31.249
Von Waldheim has to get the
train out before that.


106
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:35.421
Can we slow it down?
Delay it? What do you think?


107
00:15:36.964 --> 00:15:39.166
We can blow it up. Maybe.

108
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.719
Put some plastique under
the cars and blow it up.


109
00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.264
They'd shoot a few hostages,
but that's the price you pay.


110
00:15:46.265 --> 00:15:49.935
- Are your paintings that important?
- She doesn't want it blown up.


111
00:15:49.936 --> 00:15:52.604
London agrees the art is important.

112
00:15:52.605 --> 00:15:56.900
Anything we can do to save it.
But they leave it up to us.


113
00:15:56.901 --> 00:15:59.604
Why not? What can they lose?

114
00:16:00.863 --> 00:16:03.615
This morning we had four
men left in this group.


115
00:16:03.616 --> 00:16:07.661
Now we are three. 
One, two, three.

116
00:16:07.662 --> 00:16:10.372
- Bernard?
- We started with 18.


117
00:16:10.373 --> 00:16:13.625
Like your paintings, <i>mademoiselle,</i>
we couldn't replace them.


118
00:16:13.626 --> 00:16:18.129
For certain things, we take the risk.
But I won't waste lives on paintings.


119
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.503
But they wouldn't be wasted.

120
00:16:21.467 --> 00:16:26.093
Excuse me. I know that's
a terrible thing to say.


121
00:16:27.723 --> 00:16:30.809
But those paintings
are part of France.


122
00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:33.311
The Germans want to take them away.

123
00:16:33.312 --> 00:16:37.691
They've taken our land, our
food. They live in our houses.


124
00:16:37.692 --> 00:16:40.486
And now they're trying
to take our art.


125
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.900
This beauty, this vision of
life born out of France.


126
00:16:46.367 --> 00:16:49.446
Our special vision. Our trust.

127
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:53.999
We hold it in trust. 
Don't you see?

128
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.125
For everyone. This is our pride.

129
00:16:58.504 --> 00:17:01.628
What we create and
hold for the world.


130
00:17:02.758 --> 00:17:06.344
There are worse things to
risk your life for than that.


131
00:17:06.345 --> 00:17:08.798
I'm sorry, mademoiselle.
We can't help you.


132
00:17:13.561 --> 00:17:17.061
The train goes through his
section. It's up to him.


133
00:17:18.065 --> 00:17:20.484
Don't you have copies of 'em?

134
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:26.156
Excuse me for taking your time.

135
00:17:26.157 --> 00:17:29.075
I respect you for
what you are doing.


136
00:17:29.076 --> 00:17:31.745
I hope none of you will be harmed.

137
00:17:39.712 --> 00:17:43.007
- She's a nice lady.
- What happened to Bernard?


138
00:17:45.801 --> 00:17:49.221
I had a cup of coffee with
him early this morning.


139
00:17:49.805 --> 00:17:53.930
They came into the yards and
picked him up, with some refugees.


140
00:17:54.602 --> 00:17:56.679
I saw the whole thing.

141
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.359
They just came into the
yards and picked him up.


142
00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.278
I thought we came here to talk
about the armament train.


143
00:18:05.279 --> 00:18:08.406
It's a big one, huh, Labiche?
When does it leave?


144
00:18:08.407 --> 00:18:10.992
9:15 tomorrow morning, on the dot.

145
00:18:10.993 --> 00:18:14.197
They must be desperate
to risk a daylight run.


146
00:18:15.498 --> 00:18:17.371
Tell me the schedule.

147
00:18:17.792 --> 00:18:20.752
It'll arrive at the yards
at Vaires by 9:45.


148
00:18:20.753 --> 00:18:24.547
Five minutes to switch on the armored
engine and pick up the antiaircraft crews.


149
00:18:24.548 --> 00:18:28.298
It should be on its way by ten
minutes of ten, no later.


150
00:18:36.185 --> 00:18:39.685
It would be nice if it were
delayed for ten minutes.


151
00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:45.068
British planes will hit the yard at
Vaires tomorrow morning at 10:00.


152
00:18:45.069 --> 00:18:46.987
Saturation bombing.

153
00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:51.282
If the train was in the
yard at that time...


154
00:18:51.283 --> 00:18:53.326
Ten minutes? It won't be easy.

155
00:18:57.123 --> 00:18:58.825
Can you do it?

156
00:18:59.208 --> 00:19:02.833
- At the moment, I'm not sure how.
- That's up to you.


157
00:19:03.045 --> 00:19:05.964
The planes will bomb
at exactly 10:00.


158
00:19:05.965 --> 00:19:07.963
Will the train be there or not?

159
00:19:12.138 --> 00:19:13.681
We'll have it waiting.

160
00:19:20.312 --> 00:19:22.689
I wonder where he'll be at 10:00.

161
00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:25.439
Where I'd like to be.
In his office.


162
00:19:27.111 --> 00:19:29.571
- I don't like it.
- Who does?


163
00:19:29.572 --> 00:19:31.448
I mean the art train.

164
00:19:31.449 --> 00:19:35.118
If the Germans want it so much,
maybe we should do something.


165
00:19:35.119 --> 00:19:38.072
Forget the art train. We'll
have enough to do tomorrow.


166
00:19:39.832 --> 00:19:43.502
Which reminds me, I'll need another
engineer for the art train.


167
00:19:45.838 --> 00:19:48.465
- I'll have to give it to Papa Boule.
- Papa Boule?


168
00:19:48.466 --> 00:19:52.093
- Not Papa Boule!
- I have no choice. Who else is there?


169
00:19:52.094 --> 00:19:55.096
It's an easy run. The train
doesn't leave till dark.


170
00:19:55.097 --> 00:19:57.095
It'll be in Germany by morning.

171
00:19:58.893 --> 00:20:00.390
See you later.

172
00:20:05.024 --> 00:20:07.942
Don't just slap the oil
on anywhere, damn it!


173
00:20:07.943 --> 00:20:10.145
Look where the hell
you're putting it.


174
00:20:11.197 --> 00:20:14.115
This machine was running
before you were born.


175
00:20:14.116 --> 00:20:19.162
She's like a woman. If you don't treat her
just right, she'll make your life miserable.


176
00:20:19.163 --> 00:20:22.165
Take this. Do it right,
for God's sake.


177
00:20:22.166 --> 00:20:25.877
Because I'll be back to check
after I've had my coffee.


178
00:20:25.878 --> 00:20:29.548
Now remember. A grease
job is not a bath.


179
00:20:53.823 --> 00:20:55.570
- Papa.
- Mmm-hmm.


180
00:20:57.701 --> 00:20:59.073
A cup.

181
00:21:02.581 --> 00:21:05.751
I see Labiche is finally
giving you a train.


182
00:21:07.962 --> 00:21:11.382
- And all the way to Germany.
- Some train.


183
00:21:11.465 --> 00:21:15.426
You see any artillery? A load
that a man can feel is important?


184
00:21:15.427 --> 00:21:17.595
That might change the war, huh?

185
00:21:17.596 --> 00:21:20.219
Any important shipment
goes to the front.


186
00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:22.222
Boule.

187
00:21:23.435 --> 00:21:26.062
Have you read what's
in those crates?


188
00:21:26.063 --> 00:21:30.817
I don't believe anything they
write. Paintings! Open a case.


189
00:21:30.818 --> 00:21:34.821
You'll find champagne, perfume and
everything else they stole from us.


190
00:21:34.822 --> 00:21:39.027
I've talked to one of the truck
drivers. These are paintings.


191
00:21:40.244 --> 00:21:44.074
- So what?
- Great art. Picasso. Gauguin. Renoir.


192
00:21:45.624 --> 00:21:50.045
Renoir. I used to know a
girl who modeled for Renoir.


193
00:21:50.796 --> 00:21:53.044
She smelled of paint.

194
00:21:54.466 --> 00:21:58.842
Boule, you are a good engineer,
you have told me so.


195
00:21:59.138 --> 00:22:02.307
But in matters of culture,
you are sadly deficient.


196
00:22:02.308 --> 00:22:06.103
Champagne and perfume
can be replaced. Not art.


197
00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:10.270
- These paintings are important.
- Really?


198
00:22:11.442 --> 00:22:12.985
The glory of France.

199
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:16.154
Glory of France?

200
00:22:16.155 --> 00:22:21.326
And to think, two days, three at the
most, the Allies should be here.


201
00:22:21.327 --> 00:22:25.327
The Nazis wouldn't have the
train. Maybe even one day...


202
00:22:26.999 --> 00:22:29.834
- Are you the engineer?
- Does he look like an engineer?


203
00:22:29.835 --> 00:22:33.254
You will not leave the station
tonight. Stand by your engine,


204
00:22:33.255 --> 00:22:35.590
ready to leave at a
moment's notice.


205
00:22:43.265 --> 00:22:46.142
- Pig!
- Be careful how you talk to them.


206
00:22:46.143 --> 00:22:48.391
I'm too old to be careful.

207
00:22:52.399 --> 00:22:55.569
- The glory of France.
- Huh? Oh, yes.


208
00:22:56.987 --> 00:22:58.655
The glory of France.

209
00:23:01.784 --> 00:23:04.078
Give me the change in franc pieces.

210
00:23:12.586 --> 00:23:14.083
Engineer!

211
00:23:16.215 --> 00:23:17.758
Start the engine!

212
00:24:28.537 --> 00:24:30.159
Heil Hitler.

213
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:32.832
Loaded and ready, sir.

214
00:24:40.174 --> 00:24:41.921
Very good, Schmidt.

215
00:24:42.301 --> 00:24:45.970
- What time do you leave?
- As soon as it's dark, sir.


216
00:24:45.971 --> 00:24:49.515
Colonel Von Waldheim!
Telephone call, sir.


217
00:24:49.516 --> 00:24:52.390
General Von Lubitz's headquarters!

218
00:24:56.023 --> 00:24:58.271
The officer says it's urgent.

219
00:25:07.117 --> 00:25:09.536
Colonel Von Waldheim speaking.

220
00:25:09.953 --> 00:25:11.530
Yes, Major.

221
00:25:13.791 --> 00:25:15.493
I'm sorry to hear that.

222
00:25:16.085 --> 00:25:18.913
Let's hope the reverses at
the front are temporary.


223
00:25:20.923 --> 00:25:23.007
Yes, of course I understand.

224
00:25:23.008 --> 00:25:26.010
The general explained
it might be necessary


225
00:25:26.011 --> 00:25:28.885
to rescind the authorization
for my train.


226
00:25:32.309 --> 00:25:37.355
Unfortunately, I can't help you.
The train left over half an hour ago,


227
00:25:37.356 --> 00:25:39.934
and is now on its way to Germany.

228
00:25:40.859 --> 00:25:43.903
Please express my
regrets to the general.


229
00:25:49.034 --> 00:25:51.869
In view of the fact that
you've already left, Schmidt,


230
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:55.498
I think perhaps you'd better get aboard
and order the train out immediately, huh?


231
00:25:55.499 --> 00:25:58.418
- Yes, sir!
- Have a good trip, Schmidt.


232
00:25:59.378 --> 00:26:02.422
Start the train! 
Start the train!

233
00:26:03.215 --> 00:26:04.917
Move the train!

234
00:26:07.886 --> 00:26:10.760
Boule! Start the train.

235
00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.092
Start the train!

236
00:28:16.223 --> 00:28:19.222
Uncouple that engine!
Get it out of here!


237
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.831
Is the armored engine ready?

238
00:28:41.832 --> 00:28:44.455
Yes, sir. The antiaircraft
crews are all aboard.


239
00:28:45.377 --> 00:28:47.921
Move your engine.
Get it out of here!


240
00:30:04.998 --> 00:30:08.125
Hey, you! You pig!

241
00:30:08.126 --> 00:30:09.710
- What?
- Who did that?


242
00:30:09.711 --> 00:30:12.129
The steam is released
or the engine blows up.


243
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:14.424
- Which do you want?
- You did it on purpose.


244
00:30:15.634 --> 00:30:17.177
What is this?

245
00:30:26.978 --> 00:30:29.647
Take your assigned position.
Back of the cab.


246
00:30:29.648 --> 00:30:32.108
- Everything all right?
- Move your engines...


247
00:30:32.109 --> 00:30:34.860
- It's okay.
- Go back. I want this train out of here!


248
00:30:34.861 --> 00:30:36.108
Okay.

249
00:30:37.989 --> 00:30:41.693
- What's going on down there, Labiche?
- Sabotage.


250
00:31:07.102 --> 00:31:08.428
Throw five.

251
00:31:48.393 --> 00:31:49.890
Throw eight.

252
00:32:39.444 --> 00:32:40.816
Throw ten.

253
00:32:47.953 --> 00:32:49.621
- Throw ten.
- It's stuck!


254
00:32:52.123 --> 00:32:53.825
Don't force it.

255
00:33:15.814 --> 00:33:17.937
- Stop!
- Hey! Hey!


256
00:33:18.441 --> 00:33:20.814
Hey! Stop!

257
00:33:21.111 --> 00:33:24.110
Stop! You're on the wrong track!

258
00:33:28.451 --> 00:33:31.746
Don't play games with me, Labiche.
I know sabotage when I...


259
00:33:36.418 --> 00:33:37.835
What is it?

260
00:33:44.676 --> 00:33:46.128
But I...

261
00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.808
Give me the switch tower.

262
00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.692
Dietrich! What the hell
is going on up there?


263
00:34:01.693 --> 00:34:04.320
You idiot! You get those
switches working!


264
00:34:04.321 --> 00:34:07.072
We have got to get this
train out of here!


265
00:34:07.073 --> 00:34:09.742
I'm tired of your
inefficiency, Dietrich!


266
00:34:54.579 --> 00:34:57.247
You can't ride through an air raid!

267
00:34:57.248 --> 00:34:59.951
Watch me! Fire up that engine!

268
00:35:22.399 --> 00:35:24.942
You old goat! Get out of
there and get under cover!


269
00:35:24.943 --> 00:35:28.570
- Get off my train!
- You fool! It'll rain bombs any second!


270
00:35:28.571 --> 00:35:30.148
Get off my train!

271
00:35:33.827 --> 00:35:36.951
- You can't go! The switch is closed!
- Open it!


272
00:37:28.358 --> 00:37:29.935
What is it?

273
00:37:31.736 --> 00:37:33.313
What is it?

274
00:37:35.532 --> 00:37:36.733
Engineer!

275
00:37:40.036 --> 00:37:42.162
- What is it?
- The oil line.


276
00:37:42.163 --> 00:37:43.455
Can you fix it?

277
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:49.796
- Can we run it back to Vaires?
- Maybe, but just the engine.


278
00:37:50.588 --> 00:37:52.131
Where's the phone?

279
00:37:57.136 --> 00:37:58.883
Start the pump.

280
00:38:50.815 --> 00:38:54.484
The repair of my train is to
take top priority, Major.


281
00:38:54.485 --> 00:38:58.822
This whole yard needs repair, Colonel.
I'll see to your engine as soon as I can.


282
00:38:58.823 --> 00:39:03.201
- You'll see to it at once.
- I have my orders. I'll do what I can.


283
00:39:03.202 --> 00:39:07.157
I've given you an order.
I take full responsibility.


284
00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:24.681
- What happened?
- Fault in the oil line.


285
00:39:24.682 --> 00:39:27.806
I'll take care of it.
Hand me the spanner.


286
00:39:29.687 --> 00:39:31.560
Take over the crane engine.

287
00:39:37.195 --> 00:39:38.567
Boule!

288
00:39:40.573 --> 00:39:41.945
Boule!

289
00:39:44.327 --> 00:39:45.574
Come here.

290
00:39:47.455 --> 00:39:48.907
Come here!

291
00:39:56.506 --> 00:39:59.050
- Take off the oil caps.
- I'll do it.


292
00:40:01.511 --> 00:40:03.759
He will do it. Go on.

293
00:40:17.276 --> 00:40:21.731
- You can settle the blame for this later.
- One moment, please, sir.


294
00:40:31.249 --> 00:40:33.042
Turn out your pants pockets.

295
00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:50.802
Slick with oil.

296
00:40:51.602 --> 00:40:54.813
Sabotage, Colonel. It's
an old trick around here.


297
00:40:54.814 --> 00:40:58.393
They slip in franc pieces
and cut off the oil supply.


298
00:41:02.613 --> 00:41:06.863
- You should have thrown them away.
- Four francs are four francs.


299
00:41:15.626 --> 00:41:19.046
Major, please. It's not important.
I'll have the engine fixed overnight.


300
00:41:19.047 --> 00:41:20.839
I'll work on it myself.

301
00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.462
Take him away.

302
00:41:26.971 --> 00:41:29.173
Colonel! Stop them.

303
00:41:30.141 --> 00:41:31.467
Wait.

304
00:41:33.644 --> 00:41:38.440
Colonel. He slowed up your train
for a few hours but he saved it.


305
00:41:38.441 --> 00:41:41.068
He took it through the bombs
at the risk of his own life.


306
00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:44.362
He's an old man. He doesn't
know what he's doing.


307
00:41:44.363 --> 00:41:48.366
I'll get your train through for you.
He's just a foolish old man.


308
00:41:48.367 --> 00:41:50.660
His train! His!

309
00:41:50.661 --> 00:41:52.162
It's my train.

310
00:41:52.163 --> 00:41:54.790
I know what I'm doing.

311
00:41:54.791 --> 00:41:57.793
Do you? Huh? You'll help them.

312
00:41:57.794 --> 00:42:02.670
I practically raised you, but
you're no better than they are.


313
00:42:03.966 --> 00:42:05.713
Swine!

314
00:42:18.397 --> 00:42:21.525
Colonel! What can you gain
by the death of one old man?


315
00:42:21.526 --> 00:42:24.111
- What he did can make no difference.
- <i>Achtung! Feuer!</i>


316
00:42:24.112 --> 00:42:25.278
You can stop...

317
00:42:29.951 --> 00:42:33.155
You will deliver that
engine to me personally.


318
00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.703
I'm holding you responsible.

319
00:44:19.727 --> 00:44:21.099
Simon!

320
00:44:24.649 --> 00:44:26.772
Turn on the forced-draft.

321
00:44:28.569 --> 00:44:32.447
Hurry it up! We're working on a
locomotive, not a pocket watch!


322
00:44:32.448 --> 00:44:35.618
Hubert! Take down the grate.

323
00:44:37.203 --> 00:44:40.498
Didont... What are you doing here?

324
00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:44.869
- Where's Hubert?
- I decided to go along as fireman.


325
00:44:46.254 --> 00:44:48.546
You damn fools. You
lookin' to be shot too?


326
00:44:48.547 --> 00:44:51.883
- Papa Boule wanted it stopped.
- Papa Boule! Papa Boule is dead!


327
00:44:51.884 --> 00:44:56.721
- Stop acting like children.
- Don't be mad, Paul. We want to do this.


328
00:44:56.722 --> 00:44:58.223
Listen, you idiots.

329
00:44:58.224 --> 00:45:01.769
The war'll be over in a few
days. Now leave it alone.


330
00:45:02.561 --> 00:45:06.607
You get caught up in something...
You can't leave it alone.


331
00:45:07.608 --> 00:45:10.982
- You know how it is.
- We'll get away with it, Paul.


332
00:45:11.362 --> 00:45:15.573
All contacts have been made except
at Metz, and you have to call Metz.


333
00:45:15.574 --> 00:45:18.868
Maurice won't go along with
us until he talks to you.


334
00:45:18.869 --> 00:45:21.913
Oh, you know Maurice.
He's stubborn.


335
00:45:22.957 --> 00:45:28.086
To hell with you. To hell with both of you.
You wanna be killed, I can't stop you.


336
00:45:28.087 --> 00:45:30.422
We will be killed if you
don't call Maurice.


337
00:45:30.423 --> 00:45:33.758
Labiche! Are you
taking the night off?


338
00:45:33.759 --> 00:45:38.263
It'll be ready in a couple of hours, by
morning. I'll take it through after dark.


339
00:45:38.264 --> 00:45:41.349
When it's ready get it
out of here. Deliver it.


340
00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:44.394
- In broad daylight?
- Deliver it.


341
00:45:44.395 --> 00:45:47.772
That engine has blocked work
on four trains for the front.


342
00:45:47.773 --> 00:45:53.153
The Colonel gave orders for it to
be given top priority. He's got it.


343
00:45:53.154 --> 00:45:59.284
For all I care, it could be shot full of
holes, and his precious train with it.


344
00:45:59.285 --> 00:46:00.737
Move it!

345
00:47:03.182 --> 00:47:04.599
Spitfire.

346
00:47:27.206 --> 00:47:31.331
- No! No, Didont!
- Not us! Not us!


347
00:47:32.336 --> 00:47:34.709
Not us! Not us!

348
00:49:37.461 --> 00:49:40.164
This is the last job. The last one.

349
00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:02.361
When we get to Rive-Reine,
I'll make that call to Maurice.


350
00:50:16.083 --> 00:50:20.538
- What happened?
- Allied aircraft, ten miles back.


351
00:50:20.588 --> 00:50:22.381
Any serious damage?

352
00:50:23.632 --> 00:50:25.049
Any serious damage?

353
00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:28.345
Not enough to stop you
from getting to Germany.


354
00:50:29.263 --> 00:50:31.761
Camouflage the engine. Schwartz!

355
00:50:33.058 --> 00:50:34.517
Your engine and your crew.

356
00:50:34.518 --> 00:50:38.605
Was it your clever idea to risk
this engine in a daylight run?


357
00:50:38.606 --> 00:50:41.605
Major Herren was following
your orders to the letter.


358
00:50:42.484 --> 00:50:45.361
I admire your efficiency, Labiche,

359
00:50:45.362 --> 00:50:47.739
and your sense of survival.

360
00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:51.661
I don't suppose you have much
trouble with saboteurs, do you?


361
00:50:51.952 --> 00:50:53.369
Tell me, Labiche.

362
00:50:53.370 --> 00:50:56.914
Do you think there will be
sabotage attempts on this train?


363
00:50:56.915 --> 00:50:59.042
I'm a rail road man, not a prophet.

364
00:50:59.043 --> 00:51:02.463
Prophecy is not required,
only determination.


365
00:51:03.297 --> 00:51:07.752
This train will get through to Germany.
You agree, don't you, Labiche?


366
00:51:08.135 --> 00:51:11.930
What do you want me to do,
Colonel? Give you a guarantee?


367
00:51:12.389 --> 00:51:14.683
I'll settle for a
partial guarantee.


368
00:51:15.851 --> 00:51:17.052
You, Labiche.

369
00:51:17.853 --> 00:51:19.430
You'll drive the engine.

370
00:51:20.064 --> 00:51:23.689
The engineer's been assigned.
My orders are to return to Vaires.


371
00:51:29.406 --> 00:51:31.949
Stay with the engine.
Keep steam up.


372
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:34.619
You can go now. 
You're not needed.

373
00:51:36.205 --> 00:51:38.373
I've worked all night
on this engine.


374
00:51:38.374 --> 00:51:41.751
I haven't slept for two days.
I'll fall asleep at the control.


375
00:51:41.752 --> 00:51:45.502
You'll leave at 7:00. I think
you should rest until then.


376
00:51:45.923 --> 00:51:47.340
Take him to the hotel.

377
00:51:47.341 --> 00:51:50.511
He is to stay there until
he returns here at seven.


378
00:51:50.886 --> 00:51:52.133
Sleep well.

379
00:51:58.769 --> 00:52:00.346
My bicycle.

380
00:52:01.271 --> 00:52:03.519
Your transportation to Paris.

381
00:52:34.388 --> 00:52:35.760
<i>Danke.</i>

382
00:52:48.944 --> 00:52:52.148
- A room for this man.
- Identity card, please.


383
00:53:05.502 --> 00:53:07.204
- 60 francs.
- Pay her.


384
00:53:08.505 --> 00:53:10.878
You pay her. I'm a guest
of the German army.


385
00:53:13.844 --> 00:53:16.763
- He is a rail road man.
- 60 francs.


386
00:53:17.681 --> 00:53:20.725
- Isn't there a discount for rail road men?
- 60 francs.


387
00:53:27.399 --> 00:53:30.693
Top of the stairs, first door on
the right. The sheets are clean.


388
00:53:30.694 --> 00:53:31.895
Thank you.

389
00:53:32.946 --> 00:53:34.398
Labiche!

390
00:53:34.823 --> 00:53:38.367
You heard the Colonel. Seven
o'clock. Get some rest.


391
00:53:38.368 --> 00:53:40.115
Would like to tuck me in?

392
00:53:41.997 --> 00:53:43.574
Call me at 6:45.

393
00:55:21.889 --> 00:55:23.432
Pesquet.

394
00:55:25.058 --> 00:55:27.886
One German in the
office with Jacques.


395
00:55:28.312 --> 00:55:30.514
Give me about two minutes.

396
00:55:43.243 --> 00:55:45.161
Where are you going?

397
00:55:48.206 --> 00:55:50.784
Back in the engine.
Use your coal pile.


398
00:58:01.757 --> 00:58:04.592
- What started this?
- We don't know, sir.


399
00:58:04.593 --> 00:58:07.717
You aren't all needed.
Get back to the train.


400
00:58:24.321 --> 00:58:27.406
- Where's Labiche?
- I put him in the hotel, sir.


401
00:58:27.407 --> 00:58:29.200
A few minutes ago.

402
00:58:32.537 --> 00:58:34.705
- Sergeant!
- You two, come!


403
00:59:00.023 --> 00:59:01.232
Labiche!

404
00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:03.601
Labiche!

405
00:59:05.695 --> 00:59:07.238
Break it down.

406
00:59:14.204 --> 00:59:15.701
Look in the cellar!

407
00:59:20.377 --> 00:59:24.332
- Why are you breaking down my door?
- Labiche, where is he?


408
00:59:26.424 --> 00:59:28.217
Who's your commanding officer?

409
00:59:28.218 --> 00:59:29.544
Captain!

410
00:59:34.391 --> 00:59:36.264
Mademoiselle, come here!

411
00:59:39.688 --> 00:59:41.936
How long has he been here?

412
00:59:45.902 --> 00:59:49.322
Since soup, cabbage and potatoes.

413
01:00:14.431 --> 01:00:15.974
Thank you.

414
01:00:18.435 --> 01:00:20.019
I don't want your thanks.

415
01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:23.314
If they'd caught me helping
you, I would have been shot.


416
01:00:23.315 --> 01:00:24.773
I know. I'm sorry.

417
01:00:24.774 --> 01:00:27.401
You think you can run in
here and make trouble?


418
01:00:27.402 --> 01:00:28.944
I run a hotel, not a madhouse.

419
01:00:28.945 --> 01:00:31.739
Who's going to pay for
the door and the lock?


420
01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:34.033
Do you think money grows on trees?

421
01:00:34.034 --> 01:00:36.493
- There's a war.
- You talk about the war.


422
01:00:36.494 --> 01:00:38.571
I'll talk about what it costs.

423
01:00:43.335 --> 01:00:47.130
I'll be leaving in a few hours. You
can go back to your good customers.


424
01:00:47.297 --> 01:00:50.341
They pay. That's what
I'm in business for.


425
01:00:51.009 --> 01:00:52.506
You should be paid.

426
01:00:55.805 --> 01:00:58.508
- How much for the damage?
- 100 francs.


427
01:01:02.103 --> 01:01:04.101
How much for saving my life?

428
01:01:13.281 --> 01:01:14.698
Who did it?

429
01:01:17.494 --> 01:01:20.454
I'm not sure. I can't
remember. I was struck!


430
01:01:20.455 --> 01:01:21.907
You're lying!

431
01:01:22.999 --> 01:01:24.542
Enough, Pilzer.

432
01:01:34.344 --> 01:01:37.047
If you tell the truth, you'll live.

433
01:01:37.514 --> 01:01:40.557
Now, what does he look like?

434
01:01:40.558 --> 01:01:42.556
Colonel, I can't remember!

435
01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.392
A big man.

436
01:01:49.943 --> 01:01:51.486
A gray suit.

437
01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:55.447
A hat, I think.

438
01:01:55.448 --> 01:01:58.743
Sir, Labiche never left the hotel.

439
01:02:01.204 --> 01:02:02.530
Let him go.

440
01:02:27.063 --> 01:02:28.640
Do you want some coffee?

441
01:02:32.402 --> 01:02:34.479
It goes with the room.

442
01:02:35.238 --> 01:02:36.906
No extra charge.

443
01:02:38.616 --> 01:02:39.942
What's your name?

444
01:02:41.828 --> 01:02:44.076
Labiche, the Colonel is waiting.

445
01:02:48.835 --> 01:02:50.378
Christine.

446
01:03:07.395 --> 01:03:09.438
Did you get through?

447
01:03:09.439 --> 01:03:13.894
- Jacques, is the track all clear up ahead?
- All the way to Germany.


448
01:03:16.279 --> 01:03:18.948
Sleep well, Labiche?

449
01:03:21.451 --> 01:03:23.449
Like a baby, Colonel.

450
01:03:30.001 --> 01:03:33.087
I trust this time the
bearings are well-oiled?


451
01:03:33.088 --> 01:03:35.130
Why don't you check them yourself?

452
01:03:35.131 --> 01:03:36.628
Sergeant!

453
01:03:38.218 --> 01:03:40.386
Sergeant Schwartz
will ride with you.


454
01:03:41.596 --> 01:03:44.431
The last town before entering
Germany will be St. Avold.


455
01:03:44.432 --> 01:03:48.352
You will stop there for Captain
Schmidt to telephone a report to me.


456
01:03:48.353 --> 01:03:50.646
A pleasant trip, Captain.

457
01:03:50.647 --> 01:03:52.224
Is that clear?

458
01:03:54.484 --> 01:03:56.027
I will stop at St. Avold.

459
01:03:57.821 --> 01:04:00.322
Have you ever been
to Germany, Labiche?


460
01:04:00.323 --> 01:04:01.900
No, Colonel.

461
01:04:02.492 --> 01:04:05.786
You should find the
experience interesting.


462
01:04:05.787 --> 01:04:08.365
A chance to broaden your horizon.

463
01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:10.708
All right, stationmaster.

464
01:04:37.068 --> 01:04:39.236
Just keep out of my way.

465
01:04:43.825 --> 01:04:46.949
Stop at St. Avold, we'll
get our heads blown off.


466
01:05:28.578 --> 01:05:30.951
Get me Commercy, please.

467
01:05:34.542 --> 01:05:36.961
I don't have a direct line.

468
01:05:42.008 --> 01:05:44.461
This is rail road business!

469
01:05:50.058 --> 01:05:51.391
What's the matter?

470
01:05:51.392 --> 01:05:53.310
Your army regulations.

471
01:06:05.281 --> 01:06:07.154
Montmirail.

472
01:06:19.128 --> 01:06:20.830
ChÃ¢lons.

473
01:06:56.666 --> 01:06:59.540
Hello, Metz? It's on time.

474
01:07:10.847 --> 01:07:13.470
Hello, Metz? Rive
-Reine.

475
01:07:14.183 --> 01:07:16.260
Is that you, Maurice?

476
01:07:17.478 --> 01:07:18.645
Ah.

477
01:07:18.646 --> 01:07:20.473
Where is he?

478
01:07:21.399 --> 01:07:23.567
When will he be back?

479
01:07:25.486 --> 01:07:29.236
Have him call Jacques at
Rive-Reine as soon as possible.


480
01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:31.317
Yes, it's important.

481
01:07:31.367 --> 01:07:33.160
Thank you.

482
01:07:41.711 --> 01:07:45.380
- What time will you be home, Uncle?
- When I get home, I'll be home!


483
01:07:45.381 --> 01:07:47.299
I'm sitting enjoying myself!

484
01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.635
Drinking, playing cards,
having a good time.


485
01:07:49.636 --> 01:07:51.720
You can see that, can't you?

486
01:07:51.721 --> 01:07:54.219
Aunt Helene wanted to know.

487
01:07:54.432 --> 01:07:56.350
Robert.

488
01:07:58.770 --> 01:08:00.938
I'm a bad tempered old man.

489
01:08:45.608 --> 01:08:47.109
Why are we slowing down?

490
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:50.154
Are you blind? There's
been an air raid.


491
01:08:50.196 --> 01:08:52.649
We slow down for switching.

492
01:08:57.787 --> 01:08:59.204
What are you going to do?

493
01:09:08.965 --> 01:09:11.133
I don't want to stop at St. Avold.

494
01:09:11.134 --> 01:09:13.382
You wanna go to Germany?

495
01:09:14.762 --> 01:09:16.885
Jacques will send word.

496
01:10:38.221 --> 01:10:40.389
This is taking us south.

497
01:10:41.641 --> 01:10:44.184
I said this is taking us south!

498
01:10:44.185 --> 01:10:46.228
You saw the main
tracks are blown up.


499
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:49.064
We have to go around
the bend in the river.


500
01:10:49.065 --> 01:10:50.982
What's the next town on your map?

501
01:10:50.983 --> 01:10:52.935
RÃ©milly.

502
01:10:55.696 --> 01:10:57.030
Keep your eyes open.

503
01:10:57.031 --> 01:10:58.711
Your horizon's about
to be broadened.


504
01:11:41.617 --> 01:11:43.410
Rive
-Reine.

505
01:11:44.453 --> 01:11:46.451
Ah, Maurice.

506
01:11:46.998 --> 01:11:50.083
Mmm. You have a direct
line to Commercy.


507
01:11:50.084 --> 01:11:52.207
Right. Call them.

508
01:11:53.588 --> 01:11:56.464
My wife's cousin has
some cheese for me.


509
01:11:56.465 --> 01:12:00.260
It could be put on the midnight
train when it stops at Commercy.


510
01:12:01.095 --> 01:12:02.804
Yes. Yes, Maurice.

511
01:12:02.805 --> 01:12:06.179
The train will stop,
to unload passengers.


512
01:12:08.352 --> 01:12:09.811
Good.

513
01:12:09.812 --> 01:12:12.561
I'll save a piece
of cheese for you.


514
01:12:14.567 --> 01:12:15.893
Railroad business, huh?

515
01:12:16.235 --> 01:12:17.687
Ah.

516
01:12:41.177 --> 01:12:43.550
Next stop, St. Avold, sir.

517
01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:08.078
Do we run?

518
01:13:11.457 --> 01:13:14.456
Sergeant. Can we stretch our legs?

519
01:13:14.710 --> 01:13:16.833
All right. Get down.

520
01:13:21.717 --> 01:13:23.760
Corporal, watch them.

521
01:13:30.893 --> 01:13:33.471
You! Where's the telephone?

522
01:13:34.230 --> 01:13:35.898
Sergeant!

523
01:13:36.107 --> 01:13:38.566
Nobody leaves the train. We will
stop here only for two minutes.


524
01:13:38.567 --> 01:13:40.690
<i>Ja</i>, Captain.

525
01:13:59.255 --> 01:14:01.048
Tell Jacques the
cheese on the train.


526
01:14:02.341 --> 01:14:05.465
And to save a piece
for Pierre and Raoul.


527
01:14:10.266 --> 01:14:12.100
Hello, Colonel.

528
01:14:12.101 --> 01:14:14.804
Colonel, we are at St. Avold.

529
01:14:15.688 --> 01:14:17.435
Yes, Colonel.

530
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:44.713
What's it like here in St. Avoid?

531
01:14:48.304 --> 01:14:49.551
Well?

532
01:14:56.854 --> 01:14:59.022
I know what you mean.

533
01:14:59.648 --> 01:15:01.816
I'll be glad to get back to Berlin.

534
01:15:01.817 --> 01:15:04.611
- Schwartz!
- Yes, Captain?


535
01:15:05.154 --> 01:15:07.072
- We go.
- Get up.


536
01:15:13.829 --> 01:15:15.155
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

537
01:16:26.610 --> 01:16:28.778
We are home, Tauber.

538
01:16:29.738 --> 01:16:31.906
We are in Germany.

539
01:17:37.431 --> 01:17:40.009
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.


540
01:17:42.353 --> 01:17:45.396
You're crazy! Why did you mean
speeding into a curve like that?


541
01:17:45.397 --> 01:17:48.816
- But you told me to go ahead, didn't you?
- Yes, but at full speed?


542
01:17:48.817 --> 01:17:49.901
What do you mean?

543
01:17:49.902 --> 01:17:53.279
Hey, you should have signaled
to go slow! How should I know?


544
01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:56.574
You're just as big a fool as your
brother, and he's the worst I ever saw!


545
01:17:56.575 --> 01:17:58.197
Look at my rails!

546
01:18:15.135 --> 01:18:16.712
How close?

547
01:18:18.055 --> 01:18:19.882
Two minutes.

548
01:18:20.182 --> 01:18:21.850
Good luck.

549
01:18:21.976 --> 01:18:24.936
If anything happens,
if we get separated,


550
01:18:24.937 --> 01:18:27.137
I'll meet you at the old
farmhouse above the river.


551
01:19:20.784 --> 01:19:22.577
Take the stick.

552
01:21:05.931 --> 01:21:07.678
Halt!

553
01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:01.689
Pilzer! Get Labiche!

554
01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:03.517
Yes, sir.

555
01:24:14.411 --> 01:24:16.955
Get him! Kill him, kill him!

556
01:24:16.997 --> 01:24:20.326
Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him!


557
01:24:21.084 --> 01:24:23.210
Kill him! Kill him!

558
01:25:18.266 --> 01:25:21.140
No. No, you can't stay here.

559
01:25:26.817 --> 01:25:28.644
Fire!

560
01:25:31.446 --> 01:25:33.398
Pilzer!

561
01:25:34.616 --> 01:25:38.537
- How soon will the cranes be here?
- Major Herren is on his way now, sir.


562
01:25:38.662 --> 01:25:41.539
Everything that can be done without heavy
equipment will be completed by dark.


563
01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:43.959
Put more men to work.
I want it done faster.


564
01:25:44.835 --> 01:25:47.709
But, Colonel, till the crane
can move the engines...


565
01:25:49.881 --> 01:25:51.674
Yes, Colonel.

566
01:25:55.137 --> 01:25:58.305
Sir! No sign of Labiche, sir.

567
01:25:58.306 --> 01:26:00.474
We searched the woods for hours.
We can't find him anywhere.


568
01:26:00.475 --> 01:26:03.394
- I've had two squads looking...
- I want him!


569
01:26:03.937 --> 01:26:06.856
- He could have gone back to Paris.
- No.


570
01:26:07.649 --> 01:26:09.817
He's around somewhere, I know.

571
01:26:09.818 --> 01:26:12.695
He'll twist and turn. He'll
hide and make his plans.


572
01:26:12.696 --> 01:26:15.194
But he won't leave the train.

573
01:26:15.365 --> 01:26:17.032
I'm beginning to know him.

574
01:26:17.033 --> 01:26:19.827
Keep looking for him!
Search the town.


575
01:26:34.301 --> 01:26:36.720
I've brought you some clothes.

576
01:26:37.387 --> 01:26:40.431
- How's your leg?
- Much better, thank you.


577
01:26:51.234 --> 01:26:54.404
- What's going on out there?
- You should know.


578
01:26:54.696 --> 01:26:56.989
Engines and cars all
over the tracks.


579
01:26:56.990 --> 01:26:58.612
Rails torn.

580
01:26:58.867 --> 01:27:00.068
Any reprisals?

581
01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:03.579
Do you think they'd
declare a holiday?


582
01:27:04.289 --> 01:27:08.210
Jacques, the stationmaster,
and an engineer shot.


583
01:27:08.794 --> 01:27:12.624
Another engineer, the thin one,
was shot trying to escape.


584
01:27:12.881 --> 01:27:14.674
Pesquet.

585
01:27:16.176 --> 01:27:18.595
There'll be others.

586
01:27:35.904 --> 01:27:38.778
Labiche. Have you seen
the man, Labiche?


587
01:27:38.782 --> 01:27:40.783
- Labiche?
- Yes, Labiche!


588
01:27:40.784 --> 01:27:42.910
He was in room five.
He left yesterday!


589
01:27:42.911 --> 01:27:44.745
Yes, he left yesterday.

590
01:27:44.746 --> 01:27:46.539
I know that. I know
he left yesterday!


591
01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:48.499
I want to know if you
have seen him here today!


592
01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:51.043
Labiche, Labiche. Yes,
I've seen Labiche.


593
01:27:51.044 --> 01:27:53.462
I see him every day. And
General de Gaulle too.


594
01:27:53.463 --> 01:27:57.713
They're my best customers and I
keep them cool in the wine cellar.


595
01:28:34.963 --> 01:28:36.665
Please.

596
01:28:36.756 --> 01:28:38.966
Why did you come back here?

597
01:28:38.967 --> 01:28:41.343
Do you want everyone killed?

598
01:28:41.344 --> 01:28:45.097
Maybe you think you're a hero.
Maybe you don't care if you live.


599
01:28:45.098 --> 01:28:48.427
What right have you to
do this? Leave us alone.


600
01:28:51.646 --> 01:28:54.019
I knew Jacques all my life.

601
01:28:54.983 --> 01:28:59.029
He and his wife sat with me
when my husband was killed,


602
01:28:59.154 --> 01:29:01.402
the first year of the war.

603
01:29:01.948 --> 01:29:04.116
And now I sit with her.

604
01:29:05.243 --> 01:29:07.411
Men are such fools.

605
01:29:07.829 --> 01:29:11.124
Men want to be heroes
and their widows mourn.


606
01:29:19.049 --> 01:29:21.217
Perhaps men are fools.

607
01:29:24.763 --> 01:29:28.265
There were over a hundred
involved in stopping that train.


608
01:29:28.266 --> 01:29:32.812
Switchmen, brakemen,
yard gangs, stationmasters.


609
01:29:34.022 --> 01:29:37.271
God knows how many will
be shot, like Jacques.


610
01:29:40.028 --> 01:29:42.529
You know what's on that train?

611
01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:46.234
Paintings. That's right,
paintings. Art.


612
01:29:48.453 --> 01:29:52.123
The national heritage.
The pride of France.


613
01:29:56.503 --> 01:29:57.795
Crazy, isn't it?

614
01:30:09.516 --> 01:30:11.639
It's quiet up there.

615
01:30:13.895 --> 01:30:15.938
Where are you going?

616
01:30:16.231 --> 01:30:18.232
Perhaps I can leave now.

617
01:30:18.233 --> 01:30:21.313
You can't take two steps in daylight.
They're looking for you everywhere.


618
01:30:21.569 --> 01:30:24.780
My friend who was with me on
the train, I have to meet him.


619
01:30:24.781 --> 01:30:25.906
He may not even be alive.

620
01:30:25.907 --> 01:30:29.782
It won't help him if you're
killed. Wait until it's dark.


621
01:30:34.416 --> 01:30:36.209
Eat your food.

622
01:30:38.753 --> 01:30:41.001
It's a sin to waste bread.

623
01:31:01.276 --> 01:31:03.319
Ready? Take it up.

624
01:31:25.967 --> 01:31:28.420
Put it on its side over there.

625
01:31:29.763 --> 01:31:31.340
Major!

626
01:31:32.474 --> 01:31:34.642
Can't you move any faster?

627
01:31:34.976 --> 01:31:37.352
This is a hell of a mess you
have got here, Colonel.


628
01:31:37.353 --> 01:31:39.021
We're doing the best we can.

629
01:31:39.064 --> 01:31:40.481
I asked for two cranes.

630
01:31:42.984 --> 01:31:46.445
It took an order by staff
headquarters to get this one.


631
01:31:46.446 --> 01:31:49.900
With Von Rundstedt falling back, the army
has other uses for railway equipment.


632
01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:53.869
All Von Rundstedt can lose is men.

633
01:31:54.037 --> 01:31:56.331
This train is more valuable.

634
01:32:31.407 --> 01:32:32.733
It's all right.

635
01:33:25.587 --> 01:33:28.666
At Commercy, they shot
the stationmaster.


636
01:33:30.008 --> 01:33:32.593
At Metz, they took hostages.

637
01:33:32.594 --> 01:33:35.513
Ten of them. Shot them on the spot.

638
01:33:36.598 --> 01:33:38.345
Kids, mostly.

639
01:33:39.225 --> 01:33:41.894
You know Lefevre,
the inspector there?


640
01:33:41.895 --> 01:33:44.473
His kid, the one with asthma?

641
01:33:44.522 --> 01:33:46.645
They cured it for him.

642
01:33:48.318 --> 01:33:50.566
At ChÃ¢lons, three dead.

643
01:33:51.029 --> 01:33:53.197
That's all I know so far.

644
01:33:54.657 --> 01:33:56.575
Pesquet was right.

645
01:33:57.327 --> 01:33:59.495
This was his last job.

646
01:34:14.135 --> 01:34:16.303
- What about the train?
- Mmm.


647
01:34:16.304 --> 01:34:18.848
It'll be ready to move tomorrow.

648
01:34:19.515 --> 01:34:22.013
Where the hell are the Allies?

649
01:34:22.644 --> 01:34:25.312
What are they taking, the
tourist route to Paris?


650
01:34:25.313 --> 01:34:28.016
I'll believe them when I see them.

651
01:34:32.654 --> 01:34:34.856
In case they don't come.

652
01:35:11.734 --> 01:35:12.859
Labiche, it's me!

653
01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:15.939
- Who's with you?
- Robert, Jacques' nephew.


654
01:35:15.989 --> 01:35:17.862
Come in.

655
01:35:30.169 --> 01:35:32.918
I'm glad to see you're still alive.

656
01:35:34.716 --> 01:35:37.089
You're to be complimented.

657
01:35:39.595 --> 01:35:41.217
That was quite a job you did.

658
01:35:41.556 --> 01:35:43.056
Where are the Allies?

659
01:35:43.057 --> 01:35:44.933
What shape is the train in?

660
01:35:44.934 --> 01:35:47.432
It'll be repaired by morning.

661
01:35:47.478 --> 01:35:48.725
Thank you.

662
01:35:52.984 --> 01:35:56.939
- When does it leave Rive-Reine?
- It won't move in daylight.


663
01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:01.283
Where are the Allies?

664
01:36:02.327 --> 01:36:05.906
It has been arranged for a French
division to reach Paris first. A gesture.


665
01:36:07.415 --> 01:36:09.288
A gesture?

666
01:36:09.917 --> 01:36:12.211
They can make gestures?

667
01:36:12.587 --> 01:36:15.464
Let them make one for
Pesquet or Jacques.


668
01:36:15.465 --> 01:36:18.794
That kid of Lefevre's,
he'd appreciate a gesture.


669
01:36:21.721 --> 01:36:22.922
What do you intend to do?

670
01:36:23.890 --> 01:36:26.391
This is what we intend
to do, plastique.


671
01:36:26.392 --> 01:36:27.893
What we should have
done in the first place.


672
01:36:27.894 --> 01:36:30.813
Tomorrow night, no Allies,
we blow the train to hell.


673
01:36:31.773 --> 01:36:33.771
London wants the train saved.

674
01:36:34.275 --> 01:36:35.859
What do they want us to do?

675
01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:38.779
Stop it with our bare hands?
Lay down across the tracks?


676
01:36:39.322 --> 01:36:43.992
Right after dawn, all switching tracks
and trains in the area will be bombed.


677
01:36:43.993 --> 01:36:46.661
The art train is not
to be destroyed.


678
01:36:46.662 --> 01:36:50.287
Orders are to mark it so the
planes will pass it up.


679
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:53.373
- Mark it?
- White paint,


680
01:36:53.878 --> 01:36:56.505
on the top of the first three cars.

681
01:36:56.506 --> 01:36:59.710
London has decided the
paintings must not be damaged.


682
01:37:02.887 --> 01:37:04.589
Save it?

683
01:37:05.181 --> 01:37:08.009
For Von Waldheim?
Make him a present?


684
01:37:08.559 --> 01:37:10.060
To hell with London.

685
01:37:10.061 --> 01:37:11.812
We started this whole
thing for one reason.


686
01:37:11.813 --> 01:37:15.148
To stop the train because the
Allies were going to be here.


687
01:37:15.149 --> 01:37:17.776
Where are they? Every
day they've been due.


688
01:37:17.777 --> 01:37:20.904
And every day, a man has been killed for
thinking they were just over the hill.


689
01:37:20.905 --> 01:37:22.280
I say to hell with it!

690
01:37:22.281 --> 01:37:26.031
Now they want us to paint the
train? Let 'em blow it up!


691
01:37:35.336 --> 01:37:37.163
Paul.

692
01:37:38.506 --> 01:37:40.925
It'd be too bad
if it got blown up.

693
01:37:41.426 --> 01:37:43.879
That is, if it could be saved.

694
01:37:45.388 --> 01:37:47.681
Papa Boule, Pesquet, the others,

695
01:37:47.682 --> 01:37:49.930
they wanted it saved.

696
01:37:49.934 --> 01:37:52.557
And they're dead,
and they'll never know.


697
01:37:54.397 --> 01:37:56.144
But we will.

698
01:37:56.482 --> 01:37:59.401
White paint. Just the
first three cars.


699
01:38:03.531 --> 01:38:05.904
I can find my way back.

700
01:38:18.629 --> 01:38:20.881
You know what it's like down there?

701
01:38:20.882 --> 01:38:24.382
There are Germans all over the
place. You haven't got a chance!


702
01:38:26.053 --> 01:38:27.755
I'll figure something.

703
01:38:28.681 --> 01:38:30.140
What are you gonna do?

704
01:38:30.141 --> 01:38:32.767
You gonna walk up to the Germans and
tell them you want to paint the train


705
01:38:32.768 --> 01:38:35.103
so it will look nice when
it gets to Germany?


706
01:38:35.104 --> 01:38:36.897
Don't you see? 
It's hopeless.

707
01:38:36.898 --> 01:38:42.070
Those cars have been needing a coat
of paint ever since the war started.


708
01:38:47.325 --> 01:38:49.448
You crazy bastard.

709
01:38:50.578 --> 01:38:52.871
Who are you gonna get to help you?

710
01:38:52.872 --> 01:38:54.498
Have you thought of that?

711
01:38:54.499 --> 01:38:56.793
Who are you gonna get to help you?

712
01:38:57.251 --> 01:38:59.078
Me.

713
01:38:59.253 --> 01:39:01.080
I can fight.

714
01:39:03.174 --> 01:39:06.924
That's two of us. A small army.

715
01:39:16.646 --> 01:39:19.189
- What do you shoot with this?
- Rabbits.


716
01:39:19.190 --> 01:39:21.518
You're not fighting rabbits.

717
01:39:27.615 --> 01:39:29.449
How well do you know the
station in Rive-Reine?


718
01:39:29.450 --> 01:39:31.451
- Have you got a plan?
- Shut up.


719
01:39:31.452 --> 01:39:34.201
- I lived there all my life.
- Can you get some men to help?


720
01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:37.415
Not in Rive-Reine. They're
all working on the tracks.


721
01:39:37.416 --> 01:39:38.977
Even I serve food to the soldiers.

722
01:39:39.126 --> 01:39:40.327
Other towns?

723
01:39:42.213 --> 01:39:43.338
Montmirail.

724
01:39:43.339 --> 01:39:46.299
Uncle Jacques had friends there,
rail road men. I can get them.


725
01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:49.003
- And paint?
- Yes. And brushes too.


726
01:39:49.178 --> 01:39:51.722
See about the men and the paint.

727
01:39:52.139 --> 01:39:54.558
Be back an hour before dawn.

728
01:40:07.488 --> 01:40:09.656
With luck,

729
01:40:12.243 --> 01:40:13.786
no one will be hurt.

730
01:40:14.495 --> 01:40:17.574
No one's ever hurt. Just dead.

731
01:40:23.713 --> 01:40:27.713
Paul, have you ever seen any of
those paintings on the train?


732
01:40:28.342 --> 01:40:29.919
I haven't.

733
01:40:30.469 --> 01:40:34.515
You know, when it's over, I think
maybe we should take a look.


734
01:42:25.209 --> 01:42:27.377
Alarm!

735
01:44:20.407 --> 01:44:21.654
Herren!

736
01:44:23.202 --> 01:44:24.949
Lights!

737
01:44:29.416 --> 01:44:30.868
Pilzer!

738
01:44:43.764 --> 01:44:45.932
Didont, get off! Get off!

739
01:45:07.788 --> 01:45:09.998
Didont! Didont, run, run!

740
01:46:14.146 --> 01:46:16.895
Not thunder, Colonel. Artillery.

741
01:46:17.983 --> 01:46:19.605
How close?

742
01:46:19.902 --> 01:46:22.321
Ten miles, perhaps fifteen.

743
01:46:22.571 --> 01:46:26.491
88s I think. Our guns
falling back, retreating.


744
01:46:26.492 --> 01:46:27.867
When will you be finished?

745
01:46:27.868 --> 01:46:29.695
Half an hour.

746
01:46:30.162 --> 01:46:31.788
Does it matter?

747
01:46:31.789 --> 01:46:34.207
You can't take the
train out in daylight.


748
01:46:34.208 --> 01:46:36.206
The Allies could be
here before night.


749
01:46:36.919 --> 01:46:40.123
Possibly. But a moving
train has no chance.


750
01:47:04.905 --> 01:47:07.358
Colonel, get down! Get down!

751
01:47:57.833 --> 01:47:59.660
Why?

752
01:48:00.627 --> 01:48:03.501
The paint, Herren. 
It's a signal.

753
01:48:03.589 --> 01:48:05.715
They're not going
to bomb the train.


754
01:48:05.716 --> 01:48:08.301
Don't scrape it off.
Leave it there.


755
01:48:08.302 --> 01:48:10.254
It's my ticket to Germany.

756
01:50:51.256 --> 01:50:53.007
After him! Search the woods!

757
01:50:53.008 --> 01:50:54.300
Wait!

758
01:50:54.843 --> 01:50:57.387
Colonel, while they
search the woods,


759
01:50:57.429 --> 01:50:59.805
Labiche can blow another
section of the track.


760
01:50:59.806 --> 01:51:01.140
And another and another.

761
01:51:01.141 --> 01:51:04.015
Do you suggest he will stop
if we let him run free?


762
01:51:04.269 --> 01:51:05.846
He could have blown up the engine.

763
01:51:06.271 --> 01:51:09.315
The hostages you put
aboard prevented that.


764
01:51:09.524 --> 01:51:12.485
I can have this repaired
in less than an hour.


765
01:51:12.486 --> 01:51:16.364
Keep Labiche away from the train
for the next four or five miles,


766
01:51:16.365 --> 01:51:19.535
till we reach Montmirail, then
we will leave him behind.


767
01:51:22.412 --> 01:51:25.365
Labiche or the train. Which
do you want, Colonel?


768
01:52:00.033 --> 01:52:01.405
<i>Hier.</i>

769
01:52:36.028 --> 01:52:37.696
Stop!

770
01:53:15.108 --> 01:53:16.730
Bring over the rails!

771
01:53:43.595 --> 01:53:46.548
Now up! Good!

772
01:59:58.011 --> 01:59:59.758
Come here.

773
02:00:06.770 --> 02:00:09.018
I think I saw something.

774
02:00:59.906 --> 02:01:01.240
Stop here!

775
02:01:03.952 --> 02:01:06.280
I'll ride the front to Montmirail.

776
02:01:35.316 --> 02:01:37.939
Ten miles an hour, no more.

777
02:02:03.136 --> 02:02:05.338
Stop! Stop! Stop!

778
02:03:08.159 --> 02:03:09.861
Major!

779
02:03:17.210 --> 02:03:18.957
Yes, Colonel?

780
02:03:20.672 --> 02:03:23.170
Can we get this back on the rails?

781
02:03:24.384 --> 02:03:26.803
The crane is in Paris by now.

782
02:03:27.011 --> 02:03:29.634
Without a crane, impossible.

783
02:03:29.681 --> 02:03:31.849
Nothing is impossible!

784
02:03:32.892 --> 02:03:34.726
Get the men to work!

785
02:03:34.727 --> 02:03:36.804
I want this engine
back on the rails!


786
02:03:37.146 --> 02:03:39.898
If we had ten times as many
men it couldn't be done.


787
02:03:39.899 --> 02:03:41.733
I tell you it will!

788
02:03:41.734 --> 02:03:44.687
Do you hear me? 
I tell you it will!

789
02:03:46.155 --> 02:03:47.732
It's hopeless, Colonel.

790
02:04:15.435 --> 02:04:17.637
Unload those paintings!

791
02:04:18.104 --> 02:04:20.602
All of you, start to
unload them at once!


792
02:04:21.691 --> 02:04:23.393
Go on, now, Schwartz.

793
02:04:24.110 --> 02:04:26.153
Come on. Get to work!
Unload the crates!


794
02:04:26.154 --> 02:04:27.362
Stop!

795
02:04:27.363 --> 02:04:28.815
Come on, hurry up!

796
02:04:32.118 --> 02:04:33.661
Stop!

797
02:04:34.287 --> 02:04:37.741
Stop! Stop! Stop!

798
02:04:39.083 --> 02:04:41.793
- Get your men off the trucks, Lieutenant.
- Sir, we have orders...


799
02:04:41.794 --> 02:04:43.211
- I want those trucks.
- But, sir...


800
02:04:43.212 --> 02:04:45.881
I don't care about your
orders. Do as I say!


801
02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:50.928
Off the trucks!

802
02:04:51.721 --> 02:04:53.594
Off the trucks!

803
02:04:55.558 --> 02:04:56.805
Come on!

804
02:04:57.643 --> 02:04:58.844
Off the trucks!

805
02:05:02.607 --> 02:05:04.684
<i>Heil</i>!

806
02:05:04.734 --> 02:05:07.357
Move back! Back in your trucks!

807
02:05:07.487 --> 02:05:09.781
Back! Move back!

808
02:05:11.616 --> 02:05:13.450
Back in the trucks!
Back in the trucks!


809
02:05:13.451 --> 02:05:15.904
- What the hell's going on here?
- Him.


810
02:05:23.336 --> 02:05:24.961
I need your trucks,
Major. All of them.


811
02:05:24.962 --> 02:05:28.423
I have a cargo to deliver to
Germany. It's of vital importance.


812
02:05:28.424 --> 02:05:30.759
There's a French armored
division just over that hill.


813
02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:32.803
- What about my men?
- I don't care about your men!


814
02:05:32.804 --> 02:05:34.847
I order you to unload those trucks!

815
02:05:35.223 --> 02:05:38.302
Save your orders, Colonel.
In this sector the war is over.


816
02:05:38.309 --> 02:05:41.388
- Back in the trucks!
- I'll have you shot!


817
02:05:42.939 --> 02:05:45.107
Back in the trucks!

818
02:05:45.858 --> 02:05:47.935
Herren! Shoot that man!

819
02:05:48.152 --> 02:05:51.652
He is to be executed for
gross insubordination!


820
02:05:53.908 --> 02:05:56.611
Unload the trucks!

821
02:05:57.995 --> 02:06:00.744
Herren! I gave you an order!

822
02:06:00.873 --> 02:06:03.121
Move! Go! Schnell!
Schnell! Schnell!


823
02:06:04.377 --> 02:06:05.749
Out!

824
02:06:08.256 --> 02:06:10.424
We have lost, Colonel.

825
02:06:11.551 --> 02:06:13.253
It's hopeless.

826
02:06:13.678 --> 02:06:15.095
Look at those men.

827
02:06:15.888 --> 02:06:17.635
A defeated army.

828
02:06:21.853 --> 02:06:23.270
Lost, Herren?

829
02:06:26.023 --> 02:06:27.725
Lost?

830
02:06:29.861 --> 02:06:31.233
<i>Ja</i>.

831
02:06:35.241 --> 02:06:36.567
Come on!

832
02:06:39.662 --> 02:06:41.910
- You want transport?
- Thank you.


833
02:06:42.206 --> 02:06:45.125
- I have 50 men.
- Tell them to move fast.


834
02:06:45.251 --> 02:06:48.587
Schwartz! Bring the men on the
double! We are moving out!


835
02:06:48.588 --> 02:06:50.881
Grote, get the men in the
trucks. We are moving out.


836
02:06:50.882 --> 02:06:53.676
All of you get in the
trucks! In the trucks!


837
02:06:54.719 --> 02:06:56.928
Drop the paintings and
get in the trucks!


838
02:06:56.929 --> 02:06:58.472
Gunther!

839
02:07:10.484 --> 02:07:12.110
Stop.

840
02:07:12.111 --> 02:07:13.654
Colonel.

841
02:07:17.617 --> 02:07:19.364
You go on, Herren.

842
02:07:19.577 --> 02:07:21.825
There is nothing to
stay for, Colonel.


843
02:07:23.122 --> 02:07:25.245
You're a good officer, Herren.

844
02:07:28.836 --> 02:07:31.585
I'll be along in a few minutes.

845
02:07:32.340 --> 02:07:34.167
There'll be other trucks.

846
02:09:39.216 --> 02:09:41.384
Labiche!

847
02:09:43.471 --> 02:09:45.344
Here's your prize, Labiche.

848
02:09:47.058 --> 02:09:49.977
Some of the greatest
paintings in the world.


849
02:09:55.775 --> 02:09:57.147
Does it please you, Labiche?

850
02:09:59.904 --> 02:10:03.074
Do you feel a sense of excitement
in just being near them?


851
02:10:05.242 --> 02:10:09.663
A painting means as much to you
as a string of pearls to an ape.


852
02:10:11.791 --> 02:10:13.959
You won by sheer luck.

853
02:10:14.752 --> 02:10:18.752
You stopped me without knowing
what you were doing, or why.


854
02:10:20.508 --> 02:10:22.756
You are nothing, Labiche.

855
02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:26.343
A lump of flesh.

856
02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:29.682
The paintings are mine.

857
02:10:29.683 --> 02:10:31.806
They always will be.

858
02:10:32.436 --> 02:10:36.015
Beauty belongs to the man
who can appreciate it.


859
02:10:36.148 --> 02:10:39.318
They will always belong to
me or to a man like me.


860
02:10:44.365 --> 02:10:47.409
Now, this minute,

861
02:10:49.161 --> 02:10:52.706
you couldn't tell me why
you did what you did.
