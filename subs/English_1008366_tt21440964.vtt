Hello, everyone, and welcome
to Six Degrees of Santa.


9
00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:23.001
It's December first,
which means it's time


10
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:25.917
to kick off the third
year of our project.


11
00:00:26.047 --> 00:00:27.919
Now, if you're new
to Six Degrees,


12
00:00:28.049 --> 00:00:29.877
I'm here to give
you some instructions.


13
00:00:30.878 --> 00:00:32.924
First, you want to get
one of our special boxes,


14
00:00:33.054 --> 00:00:35.666
which has the directions
on the front.


15
00:00:35.796 --> 00:00:38.756
You can order yours for free
using the link below,


16
00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:40.758
or if you're
in the New York area,


17
00:00:40.888 --> 00:00:43.630
you can pick one up at our shop,
McNevin Paper Company.


18
00:00:45.153 --> 00:00:47.982
Next, you want to pick a gift
that's meaningful to you


19
00:00:48.113 --> 00:00:50.376
and can be enjoyed
for a short period of time.


20
00:00:52.334 --> 00:00:54.641
<i>Some people choose books,
or a Christmas movie,</i>


21
00:00:54.772 --> 00:00:55.860
<i>or a game.</i>

22
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.601
<i>For example, a puzzle.</i>

23
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.822
<i>Pack it all up in your special
Six Degrees box</i>


24
00:01:01.953 --> 00:01:04.782
<i>and then begin your search
for Santa #2.</i>


25
00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:08.350
<i>You can choose
a complete stranger,</i>


26
00:01:08.873 --> 00:01:10.440
<i>or someone in your orbit.</i>

27
00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:14.226
<i>Your neighborhood
crossing guard,</i>


28
00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:17.577
<i>or the gentleman you always see
reading on the bench.</i>


29
00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:19.144
<i>Pass it off.</i>

30
00:01:19.797 --> 00:01:21.929
<i>Then Santa #2
gets to enjoy</i>


31
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.757
<i>the gift for a day or two,</i>

32
00:01:26.368 --> 00:01:27.979
<i>then repacks it in this box</i>

33
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.243
<i>and gives it to Santa #3.</i>

34
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:36.553
<i>Then Santa #3
hands it off...</i>


35
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.602
<i>...and so on until it reaches
Santa #6,</i>


36
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:44.082
<i>who gets to keep the gift.</i>

37
00:01:46.388 --> 00:01:48.478
Thanks, Santa! 
How'd you know?

38
00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:49.653
I love puzzles!

39
00:01:49.783 --> 00:01:50.958
<i>The spirit
of Six Degrees</i>


40
00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:52.873
<i>is to connect to the world.</i>

41
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:54.527
By Santa #6,

42
00:01:54.658 --> 00:01:56.268
your gift will have made
its way to someone


43
00:01:56.398 --> 00:01:57.574
you could never have imagined.

44
00:01:57.704 --> 00:01:59.271
The process is anonymous.

45
00:02:00.098 --> 00:02:01.360
It's more fun that way!

46
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:03.057
You're just sharing
a bit of yourself


47
00:02:03.188 --> 00:02:05.451
and leaving the rest up
to Christmas magic.


48
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.585
Now, if you have any questions
or comments,


49
00:02:08.715 --> 00:02:11.501
<i>feel free to email me
at the address below.</i>


50
00:02:12.502 --> 00:02:14.286
<i>Happy gifting
and Merry Christmas!</i>


51
00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:17.289
What do you think, Director?

52
00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:19.683
I think it's our best yet!

53
00:02:19.813 --> 00:02:22.860
Well, it's December first,
so Six Degrees is live!


54
00:02:23.817 --> 00:02:24.644
Hmm!

55
00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:26.341
Did you figure out
what you're doing


56
00:02:26.472 --> 00:02:27.647
for your Six Degrees gift yet?

57
00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:29.693
I'm still deciding.

58
00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:32.565
Maybe my JingleMice
Christmas record?


59
00:02:33.523 --> 00:02:34.524
You'll never guess
what I found for mine.


60
00:02:37.352 --> 00:02:40.442
Whoa! You finally found
another copy!


61
00:02:40.573 --> 00:02:43.445
Online from a used
book store in Wisconsin.


62
00:02:44.446 --> 00:02:45.752
At least we'll always have
ours from Grandpa.


63
00:02:45.883 --> 00:02:46.971
Mm-hmm.

64
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:49.234
Remind me, what's your
favourite part again?


65
00:02:49.364 --> 00:02:52.367
I think it's when Elfie
is in New Mexico


66
00:02:52.498 --> 00:02:54.369
and she learns about luminarias

67
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.763
and how luminaria
means "light."


68
00:02:56.894 --> 00:02:59.505
Mm-hmm! Well, that's my
favourite part, too.


69
00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:01.725
And you're my little luminaria.

70
00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.866
- Oh!
- Oh!


71
00:03:12.997 --> 00:03:14.651
Good morning, Harper. Dani.

72
00:03:14.781 --> 00:03:16.043
I hope it's okay.

73
00:03:16.174 --> 00:03:17.741
I love these for a background.

74
00:03:17.871 --> 00:03:19.307
Very wholesome.

75
00:03:19.438 --> 00:03:21.571
Christmas whimsical.

76
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.137
Ooh, that might be
a good hashtag.


77
00:03:23.268 --> 00:03:24.922
I'm certainly trying
to snag more followers.


78
00:03:25.052 --> 00:03:27.315
Especially with
my new crafty venture.


79
00:03:27.446 --> 00:03:28.882
Oh, that's awesome!

80
00:03:29.013 --> 00:03:31.755
Hey, you know I slipped
an invite to our small business


81
00:03:31.885 --> 00:03:33.060
Christmas party
into your mailbox.


82
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:34.409
So, you know, you should come.

83
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.063
I'll try, if I'm not swamped.

84
00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.851
So, wow was your date
the other night?


85
00:03:40.981 --> 00:03:41.982
Dates.

86
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:44.028
Two different apps,
two different boroughs.


87
00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:45.682
5 PM, then 8 PM.

88
00:03:45.812 --> 00:03:48.293
They were both... okay.

89
00:03:48.423 --> 00:03:52.253
I have to say, online dating
doesn't sound exactly magical.


90
00:03:52.384 --> 00:03:54.038
It's the only way, Harper.

91
00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:56.301
You just let me know when
you decide to get out there.


92
00:03:56.431 --> 00:03:58.956
I'm happy to do a little
free consulting.


93
00:03:59.086 --> 00:04:02.481
Good to know, but it's not
exactly a priority right now.


94
00:04:04.265 --> 00:04:05.876
If you change your mind,
I'm here.


95
00:04:07.051 --> 00:04:08.792
Take care. Bye, Zoey.

96
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.491
Alright, let's get you
to school, huh?


97
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.112
Good morning,
my darling daughter!


98
00:04:25.243 --> 00:04:26.766
Oh! You just missed Harold.

99
00:04:26.897 --> 00:04:27.985
He dropped off another bundle

100
00:04:28.115 --> 00:04:29.377
of Six Degree
boxes for you.


101
00:04:29.508 --> 00:04:30.901
Ooh!

102
00:04:33.817 --> 00:04:35.340
What do you think
of the pattern this year?


103
00:04:35.906 --> 00:04:37.429
I think it's gorgeous. Oh.

104
00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:38.996
And...

105
00:04:39.997 --> 00:04:42.173
You were mentioned
on Ivy B. Holly,


106
00:04:42.303 --> 00:04:43.348
one of my favourite
Christmas blogs.


107
00:04:44.828 --> 00:04:47.439
"Here I go,
embarking on my second year


108
00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:48.962
of Six Degrees of Santa,

109
00:04:49.093 --> 00:04:53.706
a delightful, if mysterious,
gift chain I found online.


110
00:04:53.837 --> 00:04:54.707
Check it out!"

111
00:04:54.838 --> 00:04:57.318
Isn't that what
they call trending?


112
00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:58.493
Huh? I know I've said it before,

113
00:04:58.624 --> 00:05:01.888
but I really feel like you could
go big with this.


114
00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:04.369
I don't think that counts
as trending, Mom.


115
00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:06.763
You know what,
I've said it before,


116
00:05:06.893 --> 00:05:09.591
small and personal,
you know? Almost renegade!


117
00:05:09.722 --> 00:05:10.810
That's the whole point.

118
00:05:10.941 --> 00:05:14.945
I don't mean big
like corporate partner.


119
00:05:15.075 --> 00:05:17.643
I'm saying big, like,
get some momentum behind it.


120
00:05:17.774 --> 00:05:19.036
Find a way to get paid for it.

121
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.214
Why? Are you firing me?

122
00:05:23.344 --> 00:05:26.130
No, I like having
you around too much.


123
00:05:27.522 --> 00:05:30.221
But your skills
are being underserved.


124
00:05:31.396 --> 00:05:34.791
What? Working with my mom
in our family company


125
00:05:34.921 --> 00:05:37.315
and getting to spend
more time with my daughter?


126
00:05:38.708 --> 00:05:39.709
I'd say that counts
as fulfilling.


127
00:05:42.146 --> 00:05:45.453
I suppose I'm also saying,

128
00:05:45.584 --> 00:05:47.847
who knows how much longer
this will be around.


129
00:05:50.502 --> 00:05:52.809
Do you mean that in
the philosophical sense or...


130
00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:54.375
Mom, are you worried?

131
00:05:55.594 --> 00:05:56.900
Your father was...

132
00:05:58.205 --> 00:05:59.729
better at the business side
of things.


133
00:06:01.643 --> 00:06:02.644
December just started.

134
00:06:02.775 --> 00:06:04.646
It's our busiest time.

135
00:06:06.126 --> 00:06:08.433
We just need a banner
sale season. We'll be okay.


136
00:06:08.563 --> 00:06:09.608
Okay.

137
00:06:11.175 --> 00:06:14.395
So, what do we need
for a big banner sale season?


138
00:06:14.526 --> 00:06:16.615
A rush of Christmas spirit!

139
00:06:17.268 --> 00:06:18.095
Luck.

140
00:06:19.792 --> 00:06:20.837
Oh, before you settle in,

141
00:06:20.967 --> 00:06:24.536
can you walk these packages
over to Gus?


142
00:06:25.102 --> 00:06:26.277
Please!

143
00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:28.801
- Sure, Mom.
- Thank you!


144
00:06:28.932 --> 00:06:30.194
Mm-hmm!

145
00:06:31.586 --> 00:06:33.458
Alright, let's hear it,
people, let's hear it.


146
00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:38.202
Hi, everyone.
Thank you so much for coming.


147
00:06:38.332 --> 00:06:40.030
Lovely to see you all.

148
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.163
Now, I am beyond thrilled

149
00:06:43.294 --> 00:06:46.079
to bring my tech brand
into the real world


150
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.822
and into your living rooms
on Christmas morning with...


151
00:06:49.953 --> 00:06:50.823
SparkLTree!

152
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.001
Partnering with farmers,

153
00:06:55.132 --> 00:06:57.438
we have engineered
what we believe to be


154
00:06:57.569 --> 00:06:59.614
the perfect Christmas tree.

155
00:06:59.745 --> 00:07:04.184
From branch distribution,
shape, and needle retention,


156
00:07:04.315 --> 00:07:06.796
right down to that magnificent
conifer scent.


157
00:07:08.058 --> 00:07:10.234
Now, it comes in three sizes,

158
00:07:10.364 --> 00:07:11.104
but most importantly,

159
00:07:12.105 --> 00:07:14.325
it can be delivered
to your front door


160
00:07:14.455 --> 00:07:16.631
with the very simple
click of a button.


161
00:07:18.808 --> 00:07:19.591
Are you ready?

162
00:07:24.683 --> 00:07:26.119
- Hey, Hal.
- Hey.


163
00:07:26.728 --> 00:07:27.947
What's all this?

164
00:07:28.078 --> 00:07:31.081
Oh, it's a Christmas tree
you order online.


165
00:07:31.211 --> 00:07:33.083
Apparently it's perfect.

166
00:07:33.213 --> 00:07:36.086
Ugh! Jason Sparks.

167
00:07:37.739 --> 00:07:39.654
Of course he thinks he can
invade and commodify Christmas.


168
00:07:39.785 --> 00:07:43.093
Oh, I'd suppose
you've known him from
your Silicon Valley days.


169
00:07:43.223 --> 00:07:44.007
Yeah, I worked for him.

170
00:07:45.138 --> 00:07:46.270
Well, I mean,
for one of his companies.


171
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.924
I... I didn't know him.

172
00:07:48.054 --> 00:07:50.665
He's more of
a looming presence.


173
00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:54.931
Now just think, no more
laborious trips to the farm,


174
00:07:55.061 --> 00:07:56.976
having to strap your tree
to the roof of your car,


175
00:07:57.107 --> 00:07:57.803
scratching the paint.

176
00:07:57.934 --> 00:07:59.457
And if you live in the City,

177
00:07:59.587 --> 00:08:03.113
imagine not having to haul
your cumbersome Christmas trees


178
00:08:03.243 --> 00:08:04.418
seven city blocks,

179
00:08:04.549 --> 00:08:07.117
only to have it poke you
and give you splinters,


180
00:08:08.161 --> 00:08:10.903
sap all over your hands,
needles everywhere.


181
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.775
You gotta love
how he pretends


182
00:08:13.906 --> 00:08:14.559
like he's doing it
for our well-being.


183
00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:17.518
Eh, he's always
been nice to me.


184
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.391
You would buy one
of those things?


185
00:08:21.479 --> 00:08:23.524
Yeah! I mean, look at it.

186
00:08:23.655 --> 00:08:25.222
It's a good-looking tree!

187
00:08:25.352 --> 00:08:27.180
But what about
your trip to Watson's Farm


188
00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:28.660
with Jeanie and the kids, huh?

189
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.575
And hot cocoa in travel mugs?

190
00:08:30.705 --> 00:08:32.185
Uh, maybe we could
just stay in,


191
00:08:32.316 --> 00:08:33.491
watch A Christmas Carol instead?

192
00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:35.406
I don't believe it.

193
00:08:35.536 --> 00:08:36.842
To be continued!

194
00:08:36.973 --> 00:08:37.930
Alright. Have a good one.

195
00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:41.368
Right to your front door.

196
00:08:43.588 --> 00:08:46.112
Thank you so much.

197
00:08:46.243 --> 00:08:47.853
Thank you.

198
00:09:03.216 --> 00:09:04.435
Are you going
to get a SparkLTree?


199
00:09:07.177 --> 00:09:07.917
No.

200
00:09:11.137 --> 00:09:13.487
Oh. You don't celebrate
Christmas. I'm so sorry,


201
00:09:13.618 --> 00:09:14.619
I shouldn't assume.

202
00:09:14.749 --> 00:09:16.621
Oh, no, no.
I celebrate Christmas.


203
00:09:17.143 --> 00:09:19.276
I adore Christmas.

204
00:09:19.406 --> 00:09:21.931
But I also adore
real Christmas trees.


205
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.891
SparkLTrees are real
Christmas trees.


206
00:09:26.022 --> 00:09:28.198
Also, personally, you know,
I enjoy carrying my tree


207
00:09:28.328 --> 00:09:30.417
back those seven blocks
from the tree lot.


208
00:09:30.548 --> 00:09:32.332
You know,
a family-owned business,


209
00:09:32.463 --> 00:09:34.682
something that is practically disappearing.

210
00:09:34.813 --> 00:09:36.510
And if the tree wants
to poke me with its needles,


211
00:09:36.641 --> 00:09:37.816
well, I welcome it!

212
00:09:39.513 --> 00:09:40.123
Sorry, do I know you?

213
00:09:41.211 --> 00:09:42.516
Have I done something
to offend you?


214
00:09:42.647 --> 00:09:45.215
Why bother growing
living things at all, right?


215
00:09:45.345 --> 00:09:47.695
Why not just skip ahead to,
I don't know,


216
00:09:47.826 --> 00:09:49.175
a Christmas tree hologram

217
00:09:49.306 --> 00:09:50.698
that you can decorate
from your tablet?


218
00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:52.613
That's...

219
00:09:52.744 --> 00:09:53.875
...not a bad idea, actually.

220
00:09:55.225 --> 00:09:57.314
That would be
really good for travel. Hmm...


221
00:09:57.444 --> 00:09:59.055
Okay, why are you trying

222
00:09:59.185 --> 00:10:01.057
to take the heart
and magic out of Christmas?


223
00:10:02.884 --> 00:10:04.147
I think you're making a lot

224
00:10:04.277 --> 00:10:05.148
of assumptions about this tree.

225
00:10:06.714 --> 00:10:08.455
Tell you what, how about I send
you one, on the house?


226
00:10:08.586 --> 00:10:09.587
You might change your mind.

227
00:10:09.717 --> 00:10:10.805
I would send it back.

228
00:10:11.806 --> 00:10:12.982
Merry Christmas.

229
00:10:17.682 --> 00:10:19.118
Good morning, sir.

230
00:10:19.249 --> 00:10:20.641
Quick question for you, Elliott.

231
00:10:20.772 --> 00:10:21.468
Yeah, go ahead. Shoot, Boss.

232
00:10:21.599 --> 00:10:22.992
Do you think the SparkLTree

233
00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:26.082
brand fails
to exude magic and heart?


234
00:10:26.212 --> 00:10:27.953
Uh, I'd say it piggybacks
off the inherent magic


235
00:10:28.084 --> 00:10:28.780
and heart of the season?

236
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:29.824
We did have that focus group.

237
00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:36.527
So... this is your
forwarded mail.


238
00:10:36.657 --> 00:10:38.877
I checked for anything
time sensitive.


239
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.361
I also wasn't sure
whether to pass this one along.


240
00:10:51.107 --> 00:10:52.456
It looks great.

241
00:10:53.196 --> 00:10:54.675
Happy.

242
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.330
I suppose it was only
a matter of time.


243
00:10:57.461 --> 00:11:00.377
Um, look up their registry
and send them something nice.


244
00:11:00.507 --> 00:11:01.378
Sure.

245
00:11:14.739 --> 00:11:15.914
Come in!

246
00:11:16.697 --> 00:11:17.829
Hey, you!

247
00:11:17.959 --> 00:11:19.004
Hey! Happy December, Harper.

248
00:11:19.135 --> 00:11:20.745
Happy December to you too!

249
00:11:21.659 --> 00:11:24.053
Dani, your dad's here!

250
00:11:25.054 --> 00:11:26.098
And you guys better get moving.

251
00:11:26.229 --> 00:11:26.751
Yeah.

252
00:11:27.969 --> 00:11:29.449
Hey, I saw Six Degrees posted.

253
00:11:30.798 --> 00:11:33.323
Yes! You know, look what
I found for my gift this year.


254
00:11:33.453 --> 00:11:34.411
- Wow!
- Mm-hmm!


255
00:11:34.541 --> 00:11:36.543
And... you're going
to give it away?


256
00:11:36.674 --> 00:11:39.285
Well, yeah. I mean, it's the
perfect thing for Six Degrees.


257
00:11:39.416 --> 00:11:41.809
You know, nobody knows it,
so it's new,


258
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.246
but it's also timeless.

259
00:11:43.376 --> 00:11:45.074
And, you know, it's about
human connection.


260
00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:47.598
It basically inspired
the whole thing.


261
00:11:54.257 --> 00:11:55.214
What's up?

262
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.350
Speaking of human connection,

263
00:12:02.787 --> 00:12:04.310
I've met somebody.

264
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.096
And I really feel like
it's going to go somewhere.


265
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:08.793
Her name's Sylvia.

266
00:12:10.534 --> 00:12:11.491
And I wanted to introduce her

267
00:12:11.622 --> 00:12:14.799
to Dani but I wanted
to talk to you first.


268
00:12:14.929 --> 00:12:16.540
I trust your timing
and judgment.


269
00:12:18.324 --> 00:12:19.456
I'm happy for you.

270
00:12:21.197 --> 00:12:21.980
How about you?

271
00:12:23.416 --> 00:12:24.635
Anything going on
in that department?


272
00:12:24.765 --> 00:12:27.159
No. Nope, no.

273
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:28.378
I'm, uh...

274
00:12:28.508 --> 00:12:30.554
I'm putting all of that
on the back burner--


275
00:12:30.684 --> 00:12:31.772
Hey, Dad!

276
00:12:31.903 --> 00:12:35.472
Hey, look at you!

277
00:12:35.602 --> 00:12:36.864
Are we excited
for The Nutcracker?


278
00:12:36.995 --> 00:12:38.301
So excited!

279
00:12:39.867 --> 00:12:40.738
See, I wonder if he'll beat
the Mouse King this year.


280
00:12:41.695 --> 00:12:43.610
Dad! He always does.

281
00:12:43.741 --> 00:12:44.872
Come on, let's go.

282
00:13:17.383 --> 00:13:18.167
<i>Dear Santas,</i>

283
00:13:22.867 --> 00:13:25.696
<i>this book holds a special
place in my heart.</i>


284
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.791
I decided to go with
the Jingle Mice record.


285
00:13:33.921 --> 00:13:35.140
Oh, that's perfect!

286
00:13:35.271 --> 00:13:37.011
Do you know how many people
are going to be listening


287
00:13:37.142 --> 00:13:38.317
to your favourite
Christmas music?


288
00:13:39.362 --> 00:13:41.190
And, uh, do you have
a Santa #2 in mind?


289
00:13:42.365 --> 00:13:43.975
There's this new girl
in my class.


290
00:13:44.105 --> 00:13:46.020
She's really shy. 
How about you?

291
00:13:47.065 --> 00:13:48.197
You know, this year,

292
00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:50.155
I think I'm going
to be in the moment,


293
00:13:50.286 --> 00:13:51.548
go where inspiration takes me!

294
00:13:58.772 --> 00:13:59.469
Good morning, Leonard!

295
00:13:59.599 --> 00:14:01.297
Good morning, you two!

296
00:14:01.427 --> 00:14:02.950
Oh, it's the start
of your busy season, huh?


297
00:14:03.081 --> 00:14:05.910
Yes, but I love it.

298
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.607
It probably sounds
kind of cheesy,


299
00:14:07.738 --> 00:14:10.175
but this time of year,
it feels extra special


300
00:14:10.306 --> 00:14:13.265
to be the person who connects
the people with the packages.


301
00:14:13.396 --> 00:14:14.875
And cards.

302
00:14:15.006 --> 00:14:16.616
It makes me feel
like a V.I.P.


303
00:14:16.747 --> 00:14:18.923
- Mm-hmm!
- Very important postman!


304
00:14:37.115 --> 00:14:37.942
Huh...

305
00:14:43.077 --> 00:14:44.992
Hey, come on,

306
00:14:45.123 --> 00:14:45.950
let's read the book.

307
00:14:47.343 --> 00:14:48.126
Jump up.

308
00:14:48.257 --> 00:14:49.388
Yeah.

309
00:14:49.519 --> 00:14:50.868
What are these people doing?

310
00:14:52.086 --> 00:14:53.000
Thank you.

311
00:14:53.131 --> 00:14:54.437
And this is for you.

312
00:14:55.742 --> 00:14:58.441
♪ Craving to hold your hand

313
00:14:59.355 --> 00:15:02.271

This is for Mr. Sparks.
He gets to keep it!


318
00:15:25.294 --> 00:15:28.035
So, Christmas
is fast approaching,


319
00:15:28.166 --> 00:15:30.777
but we are pretty much
wrapped on SparkLTree.


320
00:15:30.908 --> 00:15:34.215
Um... We deployed the updates
to the companion app.


321
00:15:34.346 --> 00:15:36.653
Music Department has added
a few extra playlists.


322
00:15:36.783 --> 00:15:39.003
For example,
"Music to open presents to."


323
00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.574
And, of course, there's tree
care, wrapping tips, et cetera.


324
00:15:44.704 --> 00:15:47.272
So, uh, we should be all
good to go for your hiatus.


325
00:15:49.579 --> 00:15:51.276
Hiatus...

326
00:15:51.407 --> 00:15:53.626
Oh, there was this bake sale

327
00:15:53.757 --> 00:15:55.976
sponsorship for a local high
school basketball team


328
00:15:56.107 --> 00:15:57.587
coming this Saturday night.

329
00:15:57.717 --> 00:15:58.762
It's really small scale.

330
00:15:58.892 --> 00:16:00.503
I'm not even sure how
the request got through.


331
00:16:00.633 --> 00:16:01.678
Do you just want
me to cancel on that--


332
00:16:01.808 --> 00:16:02.505
No.

333
00:16:02.635 --> 00:16:04.202
No.

334
00:16:06.204 --> 00:16:08.249
That would go against
the sincere, down-to-earth
vibe we're going for.


335
00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.208
No, put Fabian on it.
You can coordinate remotely.


336
00:16:10.339 --> 00:16:11.122
Okay.

337
00:16:14.038 --> 00:16:15.866
Are you sure I should be
heading to Vermont tomorrow?


338
00:16:15.996 --> 00:16:16.910
Enjoy your time
with your family.


339
00:16:17.041 --> 00:16:17.824
I mean, don't forget

340
00:16:17.955 --> 00:16:19.522
to take notes on the authentic

341
00:16:19.652 --> 00:16:21.828
family Christmas
for SparkLTree 2.0.


342
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.876
But you haven't spent Christmas
with your family in three years.


343
00:16:27.312 --> 00:16:29.358
I feel like it's something
you should do, yeah.


344
00:16:32.448 --> 00:16:34.232
Uh, is everything okay?

345
00:16:37.017 --> 00:16:38.497
I think so.

346
00:16:38.628 --> 00:16:41.413
Just that off feeling, you know?

347
00:16:41.544 --> 00:16:44.634
Mmm. I'm sure
it's your open calendar.


348
00:16:44.764 --> 00:16:46.070
You're not used to it.

349
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.506
I think it's a good thing.

350
00:16:47.637 --> 00:16:50.291
I mean, everyone needs
to take time off at some point.


351
00:16:50.422 --> 00:16:52.642
And Christmas is as good
a time as any to...


352
00:16:54.295 --> 00:16:58.256
Reminds me, um, that box over
there is an actual present.


353
00:16:59.213 --> 00:17:00.954
Yeah, Hal passed it along,

354
00:17:01.085 --> 00:17:04.262
said some boy who's a fan
wanted to give it to you.


355
00:17:06.612 --> 00:17:07.265
Thank you.

356
00:17:44.302 --> 00:17:45.129
<i>Dear Santas,</i>

357
00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:48.741
<i>this book holds a special place
in my heart.</i>


358
00:17:49.916 --> 00:17:52.441
<i>My father gave me a copy
when I was a child.</i>


359
00:17:54.007 --> 00:17:57.750
<i>I miss him so much,
especially this time of year.</i>


360
00:17:57.881 --> 00:18:01.232
<i>But the very book he gave me
always reminds me</i>


361
00:18:01.362 --> 00:18:06.150
<i>that there is love and
connection to be had everywher.</i>


362
00:18:06.933 --> 00:18:08.805
<i>Maybe even right
around the corner.</i>


363
00:18:09.762 --> 00:18:11.460
<i>I wish all of this for you.</i>

364
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.072
<i>Yours, Ms. Santa #1.</i>

365
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:24.255
This very book,

366
00:18:25.691 --> 00:18:27.954
it was like a lifeline for me
when I was young.


367
00:18:29.434 --> 00:18:31.828
My family, they moved constantly
and my uncle got this for me


368
00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:36.572
to remind me that home didn't
necessarily need to be a place.


369
00:18:38.225 --> 00:18:40.706
I lost my copy and I've been
looking for one ever since.


370
00:18:40.837 --> 00:18:42.229
And then it just shows up!

371
00:18:42.839 --> 00:18:44.884
And the note on the inside...

372
00:18:46.233 --> 00:18:49.498
it feels like it was
written by me, or for me.


373
00:18:51.064 --> 00:18:55.068
So... are we looking into
a publishing venture or...


374
00:18:55.199 --> 00:18:58.158
The fact that this found me
at a time where I'm taking
a break to...


375
00:19:01.771 --> 00:19:04.077
...process how I'm feeling
about my ex getting married.


376
00:19:04.208 --> 00:19:07.777
So, are we looking
to get back into dating apps?


377
00:19:07.907 --> 00:19:09.039
Cancelling your hiatus?

378
00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:10.214
This isn't about the company.

379
00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:14.523
All I know is...

380
00:19:16.176 --> 00:19:17.830
when I read this note
in this book,


381
00:19:18.744 --> 00:19:20.964
I felt something
I haven't felt in years.


382
00:19:22.182 --> 00:19:23.619
With all those
coincidences lining up,


383
00:19:23.749 --> 00:19:25.185
I feel like it would
be negligent not to follow


384
00:19:25.316 --> 00:19:26.883
the data,
to see where this leads.


385
00:19:28.624 --> 00:19:31.540
I have to find, to meet...

386
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:34.891
Ms. Santa #1.

387
00:19:40.636 --> 00:19:42.333
I just have to say,
a few of us have really been


388
00:19:42.463 --> 00:19:43.552
rooting for you to get back
out there, sir.


389
00:19:45.118 --> 00:19:47.904
Okay, it looks like
this is the website.


390
00:19:50.036 --> 00:19:52.865
It's like a chain letter,
but with gifting?


391
00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.781
It is pretty clever,
if underdeveloped.


392
00:19:57.261 --> 00:19:58.479
There's gotta be some kind
of social media component


393
00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.481
for all these Santas
to meet each other.


394
00:20:01.047 --> 00:20:03.354
Uh, I don't see anything.

395
00:20:04.442 --> 00:20:06.096
Let's watch this video.

396
00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:09.273
<i>Hello, everyone, and welcome
to Six Degrees of Santa.</i>


397
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:11.014
<i>It's December first...</i>

398
00:20:11.144 --> 00:20:11.971
Wait a second.

399
00:20:12.493 --> 00:20:13.494
I've met this woman!

400
00:20:13.625 --> 00:20:15.453
Yeah, didn't she used
to work for us?


401
00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.456
Wait, what?

402
00:20:24.114 --> 00:20:27.247
I saw that you put
in for more boxes.


403
00:20:27.378 --> 00:20:28.771
Are you still shipping
those out, free of charge?


404
00:20:28.901 --> 00:20:31.817
Yeah! You know,
I actually mailed one off


405
00:20:31.948 --> 00:20:34.777
to Skagway, Alaska
the other day. Yeah!


406
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.041
That's gotta start
adding up, sweetheart.


407
00:20:38.868 --> 00:20:40.913
Well, you know,
sometimes people choose


408
00:20:41.044 --> 00:20:43.699
to spend their money going
to Aspen for the holidays,


409
00:20:43.829 --> 00:20:45.265
but this is how
I choose to spend mind.


410
00:20:46.266 --> 00:20:47.224
Plus, you know,
it drives foot traffic


411
00:20:47.354 --> 00:20:49.879
to the store, so I think
it's win-win.


412
00:20:50.009 --> 00:20:51.141
Harper McNevin.

413
00:20:52.533 --> 00:20:53.578
You used to work for me.

414
00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:56.842
Hmm, yeah,
have you popped by


415
00:20:56.973 --> 00:20:58.322
for a forgotten
performance review?


416
00:21:00.411 --> 00:21:01.107
Hi, I'm Jason Sparks.

417
00:21:01.238 --> 00:21:02.456
Oh, I know! Hi.

418
00:21:02.587 --> 00:21:04.545
I'm Pauline, Harper's mother.

419
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.505
This is Elliott,
my executive assistant.


420
00:21:09.115 --> 00:21:10.769
I looked into it.

421
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.642
You were one of our most
promising programmers.


422
00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:16.949
You designed Sugar Share,
charming neighborhood
sharing app.


423
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.431
Yeah, which your VP
of Business Development squelched


424
00:21:20.561 --> 00:21:22.999
because it didn't have enough
profit potential.


425
00:21:23.129 --> 00:21:24.957
Yeah, that happens.

426
00:21:25.088 --> 00:21:26.089
Why are you here?

427
00:21:27.307 --> 00:21:29.353
Uh... and how did you find me?

428
00:21:29.483 --> 00:21:30.571
Well, as a matter of fact,

429
00:21:30.702 --> 00:21:34.924
I am a Santa #6 in
your Six Degrees of Santa chain.


430
00:21:35.054 --> 00:21:37.883
Your video indicated
I might find you here,


431
00:21:38.014 --> 00:21:41.670
and well, I was hoping
you could help me locate
my original Santa.


432
00:21:42.496 --> 00:21:43.759
This is the gift I received.

433
00:21:45.935 --> 00:21:47.153
Would you look at that!
That's--


434
00:21:47.284 --> 00:21:48.502
A book. Yeah, Mom.

435
00:21:48.633 --> 00:21:50.679
It's a book that I've never
seen before in my life.


436
00:21:52.245 --> 00:21:55.684
So why do you have to find
this original Santa?


437
00:21:56.685 --> 00:21:59.644
Well, it's important to me.

438
00:22:02.081 --> 00:22:04.475
This book was a childhood
favourite of mine.


439
00:22:06.042 --> 00:22:08.392
That, along with the note
written on the inside the cover,


440
00:22:09.306 --> 00:22:10.089
well, it made me think

441
00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.136
that we might possibly
share a...


442
00:22:14.267 --> 00:22:15.051
a connection.

443
00:22:16.008 --> 00:22:17.183
You mean like romantically?

444
00:22:17.314 --> 00:22:19.185
Possibly. Maybe.

445
00:22:20.534 --> 00:22:22.536
Listen, I got a gut-feeling
and I simply can't ignore it.


446
00:22:22.667 --> 00:22:25.452
Huh... I'm going to go inside.

447
00:22:25.583 --> 00:22:27.019
I'm sure that I heard the phone.

448
00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.502
Well, I can't help you.

449
00:22:31.632 --> 00:22:34.505
The spirit of Six Degrees
is one of anonymity.


450
00:22:34.635 --> 00:22:36.028
Well, speaking of that,

451
00:22:36.159 --> 00:22:38.378
I actually have an enticing
thing to offer you in return.


452
00:22:39.553 --> 00:22:41.730
See, I think Six Degrees
has a lot of potential.


453
00:22:43.166 --> 00:22:44.080
Not interested.

454
00:22:51.783 --> 00:22:53.306
I could help you make it
a household name,


455
00:22:53.437 --> 00:22:54.655
along the lines
of "White Elephant."


456
00:22:54.786 --> 00:22:57.789
We could loop in
investors, sponsors.


457
00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.617
And we just got
that quick analysis back.


458
00:23:01.097 --> 00:23:02.751
It would be an advantageous
follow up to SparkLTree.


459
00:23:04.056 --> 00:23:06.102
Definitely not interested.

460
00:23:06.842 --> 00:23:08.191
That's not what
the site's about.


461
00:23:08.321 --> 00:23:11.455
Though, I don't recall
seeing a copyright.


462
00:23:14.153 --> 00:23:15.502
Which means there's
nothing to stop us from


463
00:23:15.633 --> 00:23:16.765
just taking off with it anyway.

464
00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:18.462
Is that a threat?

465
00:23:20.159 --> 00:23:22.596
No, I'm just thinking
out loud.


466
00:23:22.727 --> 00:23:24.424
There's gotta be some way
I can convince you to help me


467
00:23:24.555 --> 00:23:25.730
find Ms. Santa #1.

468
00:23:28.254 --> 00:23:31.127
Wait, which is it that you
want? Ms. Santa or Six Degrees?


469
00:23:31.867 --> 00:23:33.477
Well, both.

470
00:23:35.435 --> 00:23:38.656
I'm just hoping we could
make a deal, you know,
help each other.


471
00:23:40.005 --> 00:23:41.877
If you really want
to help people,


472
00:23:42.007 --> 00:23:43.966
maybe help some
of the small businesses


473
00:23:44.096 --> 00:23:45.881
that your industry
is destroying.


474
00:23:46.011 --> 00:23:48.144
You mean like this one?
Sure! Easy-peasy.


475
00:23:49.928 --> 00:23:51.190
I'll tell you what.

476
00:23:51.321 --> 00:23:53.627
You help me find
Ms. Santa #1,


477
00:23:54.977 --> 00:23:56.848
I'll help with your foot traffic
and marketing.


478
00:23:58.241 --> 00:24:00.504
McNevin Paper Company
will see unprecedented sales.


479
00:24:02.723 --> 00:24:06.118
Well, I mean, what if we can't
find Ms. Santa #1?


480
00:24:06.249 --> 00:24:09.426
You know, or we do
and she's like 99 years old


481
00:24:09.556 --> 00:24:13.169
or, you know, loathes
your very existence?


482
00:24:13.299 --> 00:24:15.824
I mean, do our terms
still stand?


483
00:24:15.954 --> 00:24:18.000
Sure. I don't think it'll
be any of those scenarios.


484
00:24:19.218 --> 00:24:20.654
Okay, so to confirm,

485
00:24:21.786 --> 00:24:24.180
you help boost McNevin Paper
Company sales,


486
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:26.443
and you leave Six Degrees alone.

487
00:24:26.573 --> 00:24:28.880
No push for growth from you
or any of your companies.


488
00:24:30.186 --> 00:24:31.143
This is the weirdest deal
I've ever made.


489
00:24:31.274 --> 00:24:32.275
Oh, just promise!

490
00:24:32.405 --> 00:24:34.538
I promise.

491
00:24:39.282 --> 00:24:40.109
It's a deal.

492
00:24:44.591 --> 00:24:45.854
Elliott.

493
00:24:52.121 --> 00:24:55.559
So you made a deal
with him to find you.


494
00:24:56.255 --> 00:24:57.778
Correct.

495
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:59.693
Look, I was this whirlwind
of confusion!


496
00:24:59.824 --> 00:25:02.044
You know, at first, I wanted
to protect Six Degrees,


497
00:25:02.174 --> 00:25:04.263
but then he mentioned helping
the shop,


498
00:25:05.308 --> 00:25:06.831
and I was mad I didn't
think of it first.


499
00:25:07.527 --> 00:25:08.528
Well, you have been known

500
00:25:08.659 --> 00:25:10.704
to occasionally miss
the forest for the trees.


501
00:25:10.835 --> 00:25:12.793
Mmm... For the SparkLTrees.

502
00:25:14.839 --> 00:25:16.145
- Option one...
- Yeah.


503
00:25:16.275 --> 00:25:17.842
You come clean
and you tell him that


504
00:25:17.973 --> 00:25:19.409
the mystery match is you.

505
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:21.498
Just see where it goes!

506
00:25:21.628 --> 00:25:23.717
No! Definitely not.

507
00:25:25.241 --> 00:25:27.286
Everything about him
goes against everything
that I care about.


508
00:25:28.461 --> 00:25:29.985
And I feel it would
nullify the deal.


509
00:25:30.115 --> 00:25:32.422
You know, why work up
all of these terms only
to turn around and say,


510
00:25:32.552 --> 00:25:34.293
"Hey, guess what? It's me!
Pay up now!"


511
00:25:34.859 --> 00:25:35.599
No, that would never fly.

512
00:25:37.253 --> 00:25:39.081
And you know I'm not
dating right now.


513
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.388
It's quite the pickle.
Mm-hmm.


514
00:25:42.954 --> 00:25:44.521
No, except, maybe not!

515
00:25:44.651 --> 00:25:47.524
You know, these tech
guys are always looking
for a new project,


516
00:25:47.654 --> 00:25:50.527
and then, within 48 hours,
they lose interest and move on.


517
00:25:50.657 --> 00:25:52.224
So I'm counting on that.

518
00:25:52.355 --> 00:25:54.444
No, I'm not interested
in buying more followers.


519
00:25:55.227 --> 00:25:56.620
That's so cringe.

520
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:59.492
The only thing that concerns
me is finding something


521
00:25:59.623 --> 00:26:00.798
for him to lose interest in.

522
00:26:02.365 --> 00:26:04.584
You could just hire an actor
to play Ms. Santa #1.


523
00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:07.848
Yeah, maybe someone
looking for a little publicity?


524
00:26:07.979 --> 00:26:08.806
Ah...

525
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:17.206
You hang out with him once,
maybe twice,


526
00:26:17.336 --> 00:26:20.209
you know, take some selfies,
create some hashtags.


527
00:26:20.339 --> 00:26:23.821
It will boost your online
presence exponentially.


528
00:26:23.952 --> 00:26:26.302
And it doesn't have to be
more than one day, maybe two.


529
00:26:26.432 --> 00:26:28.652
Unless you want it to be more?

530
00:26:29.696 --> 00:26:31.655
Nah, he's not my type.

531
00:26:31.785 --> 00:26:37.400
I mean, he's objectively
handsome in a "pulling off a
turtleneck" sort of way. But no.


532
00:26:40.142 --> 00:26:41.795
I won't have to break up
with him, will I?


533
00:26:41.926 --> 00:26:43.884
Um, no. No.

534
00:26:44.015 --> 00:26:45.843
I guarantee that
he will lose interest.


535
00:26:46.887 --> 00:26:47.540
Not because of you!

536
00:26:47.671 --> 00:26:48.846
But because...

537
00:26:50.195 --> 00:26:51.588
the tech lizard brain.

538
00:26:53.024 --> 00:26:55.374
Look, I know that this lie
may be a little dicey.


539
00:26:55.505 --> 00:26:56.767
Are you kidding me?

540
00:26:56.897 --> 00:26:59.683
With all the hijinks that get
bandied about in the online


541
00:26:59.813 --> 00:27:01.859
dating world, this is nothing!

542
00:27:03.469 --> 00:27:06.385
Well, I prefer to see it as
an acceptable white lie


543
00:27:06.516 --> 00:27:10.259
that helps multiple
small businesses.


544
00:27:10.389 --> 00:27:12.348
All you have to do is pretend
to be Santa #1.


545
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:14.785
This is your roadmap.

546
00:27:15.612 --> 00:27:17.309
You love this book.

547
00:27:18.702 --> 00:27:20.530
And I will text you
what I wrote in the front cover.


548
00:27:22.401 --> 00:27:24.621
Is there a chance that he can
discover that it's really you?


549
00:27:24.751 --> 00:27:25.883
No, no!

550
00:27:27.667 --> 00:27:28.886
Slim. Yeah.

551
00:27:30.714 --> 00:27:32.933
But he'd basically have to track
back through all of the Santas,


552
00:27:33.064 --> 00:27:34.370
and that's the beauty
of this plan,


553
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.849
because even if he does,

554
00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:40.028
Santa #2 was Leonard,
our mailman! So, we're covered!


555
00:27:42.508 --> 00:27:43.944
Sounds easy enough!
What's the next step?


556
00:27:46.947 --> 00:27:48.732
Admiring your work?

557
00:27:51.213 --> 00:27:53.345
Just thinking ahead
to SparkLTree 2.0.


558
00:27:54.216 --> 00:27:56.783
Ooh! That sounds
Christmas magical.


559
00:27:56.914 --> 00:27:58.307
It is magical.

560
00:27:59.438 --> 00:28:02.050
Here, this is for you.

561
00:28:04.095 --> 00:28:05.836
Is this part of our deal?

562
00:28:06.837 --> 00:28:08.056
No, it's just
a nice thing to do.


563
00:28:09.318 --> 00:28:10.058
Hmm.

564
00:28:13.496 --> 00:28:14.584
This is peppermint.

565
00:28:16.194 --> 00:28:17.152
I saw on your Swift-Gram
that you like the peppermint


566
00:28:17.282 --> 00:28:20.503
coffee from the kiosk
downstairs. I'm thorough.


567
00:28:23.245 --> 00:28:25.073
You seem to have
a certain idea of me.


568
00:28:25.986 --> 00:28:26.770
But that's okay.

569
00:28:27.858 --> 00:28:29.686
The lower your opinion
is of me,


570
00:28:29.816 --> 00:28:31.949
the more impressive it will be
when I become...


571
00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:32.950
impressive.

572
00:28:34.865 --> 00:28:39.261
Well, this impressive
journey will be brief.


573
00:28:39.391 --> 00:28:42.525
Good news! I found
Ms. Santa #1!


574
00:28:42.655 --> 00:28:45.615
Yeah, I was able to track
her back through the website


575
00:28:45.745 --> 00:28:48.226
and, you know,
it's a crazy coincidence,


576
00:28:48.357 --> 00:28:51.795
because I actually know her.
Yeah! She's my neighbour!


577
00:28:53.666 --> 00:28:56.495
Well, maybe not that crazy
a coincidence,


578
00:28:56.626 --> 00:28:58.367
since, you know,
most of the people that use


579
00:28:58.497 --> 00:28:59.716
Six Degrees of Santa
are people that I know


580
00:28:59.846 --> 00:29:04.764
because my website is so
underdeveloped, like you said.


581
00:29:06.114 --> 00:29:08.507
Her name is Zoey.
I will send you her number.


582
00:29:08.638 --> 00:29:09.682
And yeah, good luck with that.

583
00:29:09.813 --> 00:29:11.467
I'll be in touch about
my side of the deal.


584
00:29:11.597 --> 00:29:13.469
- Wait!
- What?


585
00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:16.689
That can't be it.

586
00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:17.690
I mean, especially since
you know her.


587
00:29:17.821 --> 00:29:19.649
You gotta give me
some details here.


588
00:29:19.779 --> 00:29:22.695
I mean, what does she like?

589
00:29:24.088 --> 00:29:26.264
Well, she's public on all
her social media platforms,


590
00:29:26.395 --> 00:29:28.005
so, you know,
figure her out,


591
00:29:29.354 --> 00:29:30.747
like you did
with the peppermint coffee.


592
00:29:32.183 --> 00:29:34.098
Isn't that how we learn
about each other these days?


593
00:29:34.229 --> 00:29:35.665
But that's not
your philosophy.


594
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.625
That's okay. You do you.

595
00:29:39.756 --> 00:29:42.889
Also, this doesn't seem
like a very good deal for me.


596
00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.935
You just give me a phone number,

597
00:29:45.065 --> 00:29:47.155
and then I help rescue
your family business?


598
00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:49.722
Rise from the ashes?
Completely save it? No.


599
00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:52.812
Why don't you come with me

600
00:29:52.943 --> 00:29:55.163
and we'll scope out
the situation a little?


601
00:29:55.293 --> 00:29:58.122
Maybe we can even organize
one of those quirky run-ins


602
00:29:58.253 --> 00:29:59.819
that they do in the movies,
you know?


603
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:02.082
- A meet-cute?
- Sure.


604
00:30:03.214 --> 00:30:04.346
How can you be one of
the most successful people


605
00:30:04.476 --> 00:30:06.522
in the world and not know
what that is?


606
00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:08.741
Can't your assistant help you?

607
00:30:09.916 --> 00:30:11.048
I gave him time off
for the holiday.


608
00:30:16.923 --> 00:30:19.796
Fine, yeah. Fine.

609
00:30:19.926 --> 00:30:23.365
But you know what?
I need to call my mom first.


610
00:30:23.495 --> 00:30:24.583
- Sure.
- Yeah.


611
00:30:24.714 --> 00:30:27.151
- Tell her I say hello.
- Mmm, not likely.


612
00:30:27.282 --> 00:30:28.718
Oh man...

613
00:30:36.682 --> 00:30:39.729
Zoey, hey, okay,
bear with me here.


614
00:30:41.078 --> 00:30:42.384
We're going to need
to add a little theatre.


615
00:30:44.864 --> 00:30:49.652
She teaches workout classes,
she's some kind of influencer,


616
00:30:49.782 --> 00:30:52.002
and she also sells
artwork on Craft-Zalea.


617
00:30:52.132 --> 00:30:53.960
So she's really into
the gig economy,


618
00:30:54.091 --> 00:30:55.571
so you'll have lots
to talk about.


619
00:30:56.833 --> 00:30:57.703
She is quite pretty.

620
00:30:58.487 --> 00:30:59.401
Well, that's a win-win!

621
00:31:01.011 --> 00:31:03.448
And I also know from her feed
that she often comes here


622
00:31:03.579 --> 00:31:05.798
for a snack after teaching
a Pilates class.


623
00:31:05.929 --> 00:31:07.887
So, you know, we just have
to keep a lookout


624
00:31:08.018 --> 00:31:12.109
and maybe we can stage one of
those so-called quirky run-ins.


625
00:31:13.153 --> 00:31:14.720
Maybe you can bump into
each other,


626
00:31:14.851 --> 00:31:17.854
or you both reach for the
last pastry at the same time.


627
00:31:18.768 --> 00:31:20.160
Maybe the coffee
spilling thing?


628
00:31:20.291 --> 00:31:22.162
That's usually pretty cute, no?
No?


629
00:31:22.293 --> 00:31:23.599
No. Definitely not.

630
00:31:27.559 --> 00:31:29.518
Do you think I should tell
her the whole truth?


631
00:31:30.083 --> 00:31:31.433
Like, that I sought her out?

632
00:31:32.825 --> 00:31:34.871
Well, uh, it depends.

633
00:31:36.742 --> 00:31:39.092
You know what? Maybe the fewer
the charades, the better.


634
00:31:40.616 --> 00:31:42.226
See, this is what I don't
get about Six Degrees of Santa.


635
00:31:42.357 --> 00:31:44.359
Here you have
an opportunity for a genuine,


636
00:31:44.489 --> 00:31:46.448
charade-free connection,

637
00:31:46.578 --> 00:31:48.319
and your system
literally prevents that.


638
00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.278
It's not a matchmaking service.

639
00:31:51.191 --> 00:31:53.063
You know, I actually
had a dream about


640
00:31:53.193 --> 00:31:54.456
Six Degrees last night.

641
00:31:54.586 --> 00:31:57.197
Sometimes I have these
creative problem-solving dreams.


642
00:31:57.328 --> 00:31:58.851
Will you please stop dreaming
about my website?


643
00:31:58.982 --> 00:32:00.723
But it has so much
untapped potential.


644
00:32:00.853 --> 00:32:02.072
Mmm, not your problem!

645
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.945
Oh, no. I need
to get a napkin.


646
00:32:06.076 --> 00:32:09.122
I will go. You stay here
and keep an eye out for Zoey.


647
00:32:09.253 --> 00:32:11.037
And you know, please,
stop dreaming about my website.


648
00:32:11.168 --> 00:32:12.735
Oh!

649
00:32:12.865 --> 00:32:15.390
Harper? My neighbour?
Is that you?


650
00:32:17.696 --> 00:32:18.480
Zoey!

651
00:32:19.872 --> 00:32:20.612
- Here, here.
- What are you doing here?


652
00:32:20.743 --> 00:32:21.831
Use this.

653
00:32:23.223 --> 00:32:24.921
No, it's too nice.

654
00:32:25.051 --> 00:32:26.314
It's fine, here.

655
00:32:29.142 --> 00:32:31.667
Hi. I'm Jason.
- I'm Zoey.


656
00:32:32.363 --> 00:32:33.103
Hi, Zoey.

657
00:32:33.233 --> 00:32:34.017
Um...

658
00:32:34.844 --> 00:32:35.845
Um...

659
00:32:46.899 --> 00:32:47.683
Smells good.

660
00:32:47.813 --> 00:32:48.640
So, are you new to...

661
00:32:48.771 --> 00:32:50.294
Yeah, just around the corner.

662
00:32:50.425 --> 00:32:53.515
I teach dance fitness
and yoga. That's where I was.


663
00:32:55.865 --> 00:32:58.824
O
-M
-G! Harper,

664
00:32:58.955 --> 00:33:00.348
you will not believe
what we just discovered!


665
00:33:01.349 --> 00:33:02.872
What did you just discover?

666
00:33:03.002 --> 00:33:07.137
Jason and I here are part
of the same Six Degrees Chain...


667
00:33:07.267 --> 00:33:09.400
that I started with a book
called Neighbourhood Elf.


668
00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:10.880
Northbound Elf.

669
00:33:11.968 --> 00:33:12.795
Right!

670
00:33:13.578 --> 00:33:14.927
I'm just shaken up about

671
00:33:15.058 --> 00:33:16.625
the bizarreness
of this coincidence!


672
00:33:18.757 --> 00:33:20.280
We should commemorate
this moment.


673
00:33:20.411 --> 00:33:22.065
- Yeah.
- Oh, sure, yeah. Okay.


674
00:33:34.164 --> 00:33:36.166
So, I was thinking about
the different variations


675
00:33:36.296 --> 00:33:37.254
of this Six Degrees
of Santa thing,


676
00:33:38.821 --> 00:33:40.083
and so there were four other
people in our gift chain.


677
00:33:41.127 --> 00:33:42.041
'I wonder who they were.

678
00:33:42.172 --> 00:33:43.652
Well, I know one.

679
00:33:43.782 --> 00:33:46.568
Our mailman,
Leonard, was Santa #2,


680
00:33:47.351 --> 00:33:49.005
so that's something.

681
00:33:49.832 --> 00:33:51.355
That is something.

682
00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:56.404
That's a great scarf.

683
00:33:56.534 --> 00:33:59.363
- Oh, you like it?
- Yeah.


684
00:33:59.494 --> 00:34:01.757
It's one of mine.
I mean, I designed it.


685
00:34:03.106 --> 00:34:04.803
I have a store on Craft
-Zalea.

686
00:34:04.934 --> 00:34:06.631
Oh, yes. Harper mentioned

687
00:34:06.762 --> 00:34:07.937
that you were working
the gig economy.


688
00:34:08.067 --> 00:34:10.722
The shop is called Zo
-Brad,

689
00:34:10.853 --> 00:34:14.073
'cause my name is Zoey Bradford
but no "E" or "Y".


690
00:34:14.204 --> 00:34:16.685
In case you wanted to

691
00:34:16.815 --> 00:34:19.514
check it out, or mention it,
or hashtag it.


692
00:34:19.644 --> 00:34:21.167
Yeah, sure.

693
00:34:25.737 --> 00:34:28.436
Yeah, I can get
my social media manager on it,


694
00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:30.046
and get you a mention or two.

695
00:34:30.612 --> 00:34:31.395
Yeah.

696
00:34:33.832 --> 00:34:36.618
So... Northbound Elf.

697
00:34:36.748 --> 00:34:38.315
It seems like it really
meant a lot to you.


698
00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:42.450
Totally. Yes.

699
00:34:43.886 --> 00:34:46.323
There's this part when
Elfie is in Machu Picchu,


700
00:34:46.454 --> 00:34:49.326
and I was like...

701
00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:51.371
I need to travel more!

702
00:34:54.984 --> 00:34:57.421
That's, uh...
a worthwhile goal.


703
00:34:59.336 --> 00:35:00.250
Cheers.

704
00:35:04.559 --> 00:35:06.343
Look, this woman
had a great idea!


705
00:35:07.997 --> 00:35:10.303
She said, "This year, I gifted
a set of cookie cutters


706
00:35:10.434 --> 00:35:13.176
and my grandma's cookie recipe.

707
00:35:14.917 --> 00:35:17.485
It felt like keeping her love
alive and spreading it around.


708
00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:20.009
Thank you for making
this happen."


709
00:35:22.185 --> 00:35:23.360
Do you want to read
the next one?


710
00:35:26.798 --> 00:35:28.104
Where is Kolkata?

711
00:35:29.366 --> 00:35:30.280
What?!

712
00:35:31.194 --> 00:35:32.500
It's in India.

713
00:35:33.675 --> 00:35:36.112
It's from a young man
named Arjun.


714
00:35:36.852 --> 00:35:38.723
He's wondering how his gift...

715
00:35:40.333 --> 00:35:43.467
a snow globe from St. Louis
made it all the way to him,


716
00:35:43.598 --> 00:35:46.775
and he wants to start
his own chain.


717
00:35:47.471 --> 00:35:48.864
Can you get him a box in time?

718
00:35:50.169 --> 00:35:52.215
Oh, I don't think so, but...

719
00:35:53.999 --> 00:35:55.392
Well, what do you think we
should do, business partner?


720
00:35:57.655 --> 00:35:59.875
Could he make his own box?

721
00:36:00.876 --> 00:36:03.226
Great idea. I'll let him know.

722
00:36:08.231 --> 00:36:10.102
I finally fixed
the ordering page!


723
00:36:10.233 --> 00:36:11.713
Oh, my hero!

724
00:36:14.629 --> 00:36:16.935
Oh! You practising
for the party tonight?


725
00:36:19.024 --> 00:36:21.461
I thought you were
representing us in the wrapping
competition this year.


726
00:36:21.592 --> 00:36:22.680
No, it's your turn.

727
00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:25.378
One sec.

728
00:36:25.509 --> 00:36:28.468
Oh! So, how did the date go?

729
00:36:28.599 --> 00:36:30.166
I thought I did my job.

730
00:36:30.296 --> 00:36:32.342
It was just bad enough,
kept it believable.


731
00:36:32.472 --> 00:36:34.910
I really played up
the insincere influencer thing.


732
00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:36.346
Zero chemistry.

733
00:36:36.476 --> 00:36:38.740
Good. Good, good, good.

734
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:41.351
Yes. Except he scheduled
a second date, for tonight!


735
00:36:42.787 --> 00:36:44.223
I don't know if he thought
it went well, or...?


736
00:36:45.529 --> 00:36:49.141
Oh. Well, I mean, did you
at least get an online boost?


737
00:36:49.272 --> 00:36:51.753
Such a boost!
Everything's gone nuts.


738
00:36:51.883 --> 00:36:53.798
I have all these orders,
so now I'm, like, overbooked.


739
00:36:54.973 --> 00:36:56.409
I don't know what to do about
this second date.


740
00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.760
<i>Do I go and act horribly?
Chew with my mouth open?</i>


741
00:36:59.674 --> 00:37:00.588
Let me...

742
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.287
see what I can do on my end.

743
00:37:04.983 --> 00:37:05.593
Okay.

744
00:37:06.898 --> 00:37:09.161
Um, wrapping paper malfunction.

745
00:37:10.293 --> 00:37:11.816
Good morning, you two!
Here you go.


746
00:37:11.947 --> 00:37:13.775
- Hi! Oh, thanks!
- You're welcome.


747
00:37:13.905 --> 00:37:15.515
Please, feel free to browse.

748
00:37:15.646 --> 00:37:16.778
We have a friends
and family discount.


749
00:37:18.693 --> 00:37:21.130
So, how did the date go?

750
00:37:22.131 --> 00:37:24.307
The date was... not great.

751
00:37:26.004 --> 00:37:28.920
Oh! Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.


752
00:37:30.139 --> 00:37:31.619
But I've already gone ahead
and scheduled a second date.


753
00:37:33.185 --> 00:37:35.144
You know, at first I was
a little irked that it seemed


754
00:37:35.274 --> 00:37:37.929
like she was just using me to
boost her social media presence.


755
00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:41.629
But then I thought,
why be offended by her being
a savvy business woman?


756
00:37:43.326 --> 00:37:45.154
When I brought up
Northbound Elf, yeah,


757
00:37:45.284 --> 00:37:46.982
her response
was a little flip,


758
00:37:48.113 --> 00:37:50.812
but why should I expect
her to open up right away?


759
00:37:50.942 --> 00:37:52.161
On command, you know?

760
00:37:54.946 --> 00:37:57.514
That's actually a very mature
way of looking at things.


761
00:37:59.864 --> 00:38:03.346
But didn't you have
one of those popular Life-Talks?


762
00:38:03.476 --> 00:38:06.305
You know, about sunken costs
and minimizing wasted time?


763
00:38:06.436 --> 00:38:10.658
I mean, if the first date
did not work, why not move on?


764
00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:13.138
That's what I used to do,
just move on to the next thing.


765
00:38:14.662 --> 00:38:16.011
But if this connection
felt different, then shouldn't


766
00:38:16.141 --> 00:38:17.012
I approach it differently?

767
00:38:19.449 --> 00:38:20.668
I don't know, I...

768
00:38:21.843 --> 00:38:24.280
I just don't want you
to get hurt.


769
00:38:32.418 --> 00:38:33.898
Oh, no way!

770
00:38:34.029 --> 00:38:35.030
Roller skates?

771
00:38:35.987 --> 00:38:36.858
Do you sell these?

772
00:38:37.641 --> 00:38:38.555
No, those are mine.

773
00:38:39.904 --> 00:38:42.559
And no, we do not sell them.

774
00:38:46.041 --> 00:38:49.392
Okay, quick Six Degrees
question for you.


775
00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:52.090
Why stop at number six?

776
00:38:53.222 --> 00:38:54.832
Well, that's the saying,
isn't it?


777
00:38:55.572 --> 00:38:57.226
"Six degrees of separation."

778
00:38:58.923 --> 00:39:01.447
You know, and the box
won't last forever.


779
00:39:03.145 --> 00:39:04.407
And aren't you supposed
to be one of the busiest
people in the world?


780
00:39:04.537 --> 00:39:05.451
I mean, how do you have time to,

781
00:39:05.582 --> 00:39:07.976
you know, hang out
and critique my hobby?


782
00:39:08.541 --> 00:39:11.196
Oh, well, I am on hiatus.

783
00:39:11.936 --> 00:39:13.242
Yeah, I'm taking a break

784
00:39:13.372 --> 00:39:14.939
from work for the first
time in years.


785
00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:17.028
Oh!

786
00:39:17.159 --> 00:39:18.900
Now it all makes sense.

787
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:20.510
You're not looking for love.

788
00:39:21.772 --> 00:39:23.687
You are looking
for a new project!


789
00:39:23.818 --> 00:39:26.429
And maybe that's something
that I can help you with.


790
00:39:26.559 --> 00:39:28.605
You know, we can spitball
some ideas, huh?


791
00:39:28.736 --> 00:39:30.738
I mean, why don't we revisit
the Christmas tree hologram


792
00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:32.043
that I pitched you
in the elevator?


793
00:39:32.174 --> 00:39:33.871
Yeah? Or, um... I mean,

794
00:39:34.002 --> 00:39:36.047
what is the SparkLTree
of Valentine's Day?


795
00:39:36.613 --> 00:39:37.832
How about we discuss

796
00:39:37.962 --> 00:39:41.096
the sales makeover
I had planned for this place?


797
00:39:41.836 --> 00:39:43.620
Sure, yeah.

798
00:39:43.751 --> 00:39:44.752
Talk to me. Where do we start?

799
00:39:46.884 --> 00:39:51.541
Done. I just dropped you
the SparkLTree companion app.


800
00:39:51.671 --> 00:39:54.022
There's a new feature
on the McNevin Paper Company.


801
00:39:54.152 --> 00:39:55.980
I filed it under
gift wrapping ideas.


802
00:39:56.111 --> 00:39:57.765
I thought that was
the perfect home for it.


803
00:39:57.895 --> 00:40:00.550
I just, I thought we were
working on this together.


804
00:40:02.813 --> 00:40:06.556
You know, I have to admit,
this is... it's not bad.


805
00:40:08.732 --> 00:40:10.560
But this seems very generous.

806
00:40:18.133 --> 00:40:20.309
Oh, it's Zoey. She just
cancelled our date tonight.


807
00:40:24.008 --> 00:40:24.748
You know what?

808
00:40:24.879 --> 00:40:26.402
Maybe the significance of all

809
00:40:26.532 --> 00:40:29.100
of this is that your heart
is open.


810
00:40:29.231 --> 00:40:32.060
You know? So why don't you
try online dating, huh?


811
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:33.322
That's a project!

812
00:40:34.714 --> 00:40:38.414
Oh, can you believe
Haley just cancelled?


813
00:40:38.544 --> 00:40:41.069
You're going to have
to find somebody else
to compete against.


814
00:40:44.246 --> 00:40:46.683
Well, unless Jason could do it.

815
00:40:50.034 --> 00:40:51.644
Uh, I do have
the night free now.


816
00:40:51.775 --> 00:40:55.344
Can we really invite
Jason Sparks to a small business


817
00:40:55.474 --> 00:40:57.172
Christmas party
for local businesses?


818
00:40:59.304 --> 00:41:00.784
Yeah, that is a pickle.

819
00:41:00.915 --> 00:41:03.004
Oh, heck. Let's just
put him in a disguise!


820
00:41:05.571 --> 00:41:09.706
Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas!

821
00:41:15.146 --> 00:41:17.453
- Hey, Mom!
- Hey, honey! Ooh!


822
00:41:18.889 --> 00:41:20.195
Who is this?

823
00:41:20.325 --> 00:41:23.372
Oh! Why, I'm Santa, of course.

824
00:41:24.155 --> 00:41:25.374
This is Jason, he is a...

825
00:41:26.462 --> 00:41:27.463
a work colleague?

826
00:41:28.943 --> 00:41:30.379
This is my daughter, Dani.

827
00:41:30.509 --> 00:41:32.990
Hi, Dani. It's very
nice to meet you.


828
00:41:33.121 --> 00:41:34.949
Now, tell me, how were
my Santa belly laughs?


829
00:41:35.079 --> 00:41:36.820
And be honest,
on a scale of one to ten?


830
00:41:38.735 --> 00:41:41.564
Uh, maybe five.

831
00:41:42.347 --> 00:41:43.740
Geez, tough crowd.

832
00:41:44.567 --> 00:41:45.655
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

833
00:41:45.785 --> 00:41:48.658
Maybe I'll even hire you
on as a Santa consultant.


834
00:41:48.788 --> 00:41:49.789
We could use somebody
like you around.


835
00:41:53.532 --> 00:41:56.361
I hope everyone is enjoying

836
00:41:56.492 --> 00:42:00.017
this celebration of Christmas
and local small business!


837
00:42:00.148 --> 00:42:01.279
As many of you know,

838
00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:06.458
we have our traditional
gift wrapping tournament,


839
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:09.418
sponsored by the McNevin
Paper Company!


840
00:42:09.548 --> 00:42:11.246
The McNevin family
is being represented


841
00:42:11.376 --> 00:42:13.204
by my daughter Harper this year,

842
00:42:13.335 --> 00:42:16.860
who will compete against
a customary celebrity guest.


843
00:42:16.991 --> 00:42:20.864
And this year,
our celebrity is Santa Claus!


844
00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:23.911
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

845
00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:26.652
Thank you, young lady.

846
00:42:26.783 --> 00:42:28.176
You've been a good girl
this year.


847
00:42:28.306 --> 00:42:32.049
Oh! Well, competitors
will be judged on speed,


848
00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.617
technique, and creativity!

849
00:42:37.185 --> 00:42:38.447
Thank you.

850
00:42:39.883 --> 00:42:41.145
You know, I hope you're ready
for defeat.


851
00:42:41.276 --> 00:42:42.451
I grew up in this industry,

852
00:42:42.581 --> 00:42:44.105
so, I was somewhat

853
00:42:44.235 --> 00:42:46.672
of a wunderkind and I've
only improved from there.


854
00:42:46.803 --> 00:42:48.848
You know,
I'm not so bad myself.


855
00:42:49.675 --> 00:42:51.199
It's all about making
shapes and forms,


856
00:42:51.329 --> 00:42:55.681
and my visuospatial ability
is unparalleled.


857
00:42:55.812 --> 00:42:56.944

878
00:44:24.118 --> 00:44:27.164
There has been
a noticeable increase


879
00:44:27.295 --> 00:44:29.514
in our online sales
for the last few hours.


880
00:44:29.645 --> 00:44:32.256
Well, that must be from Jason
putting us up on his app.


881
00:44:32.387 --> 00:44:35.129
Oh, tech mogul who's actually

882
00:44:35.259 --> 00:44:36.739
good at what he does.

883
00:44:42.397 --> 00:44:44.790
I didn't know that Zoey
was coming.


884
00:44:44.921 --> 00:44:46.183
Yeah...

885
00:44:46.314 --> 00:44:47.793
I forgot I invited her,

886
00:44:47.924 --> 00:44:50.840
otherwise I would have
warned Jason.


887
00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:52.581
She stood him up today.

888
00:44:54.235 --> 00:44:55.932
Wasn't that basically
your plan?


889
00:44:57.325 --> 00:44:59.892
Uh, yea... yeah...

890
00:45:00.023 --> 00:45:01.938
I mean... but it's awkward.

891
00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:06.682
I'm beginning to feel guilty.

892
00:45:06.812 --> 00:45:08.597
What do you think would happen
if I told him?


893
00:45:10.599 --> 00:45:12.427
There's only one way
to find out.


894
00:45:23.133 --> 00:45:24.526
That was really fun.

895
00:45:24.656 --> 00:45:26.441
Yes.

896
00:45:26.571 --> 00:45:28.921
- One Santa suit.
- Ah.


897
00:45:29.052 --> 00:45:32.795
And one... sweater.

898
00:45:32.925 --> 00:45:34.623
Thank you.

899
00:45:40.281 --> 00:45:42.674
- I have to tell you something--
- So, I came clean-- Oh.


900
00:45:42.805 --> 00:45:44.720
- You go.
- I just wanted to tell you


901
00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:47.810
that Zoey apologized for
cancelling our date earlier.


902
00:45:48.724 --> 00:45:51.248
So, feeling inspired,

903
00:45:51.379 --> 00:45:55.644
I came clean that I sought
her out as Miss Santa #1.


904
00:45:55.774 --> 00:45:58.473
And I told her that you were
kind enough to help me out.


905
00:46:00.388 --> 00:46:02.085
Wow. That's...

906
00:46:02.216 --> 00:46:03.434
That's great news.

907
00:46:03.565 --> 00:46:07.656
It must feel really good
to get that off your chest.


908
00:46:07.786 --> 00:46:09.832
Yeah. Yeah.

909
00:46:09.962 --> 00:46:12.661
She took it surprisingly well.

910
00:46:12.791 --> 00:46:14.750
She wasn't even mad at all.

911
00:46:15.577 --> 00:46:17.579
You know, like, yes,

912
00:46:17.709 --> 00:46:20.756
I wish that we had connected
more on our date,


913
00:46:20.886 --> 00:46:24.803
but it's just that gut-feeling
I got from the book


914
00:46:24.934 --> 00:46:27.545
and... I just feel like

915
00:46:27.676 --> 00:46:30.026
I have to see it through,
you know?


916
00:46:31.636 --> 00:46:34.030
You gotta follow
that gut-feeling, I guess.


917
00:46:37.381 --> 00:46:38.948
Yeah.

918
00:46:40.341 --> 00:46:42.560
Uh, so sorry, what were
you gonna say earlier?


919
00:46:42.691 --> 00:46:48.044
Oh, um, yeah,
I wanted to say...


920
00:46:52.266 --> 00:46:54.006
...thank you.

921
00:46:54.137 --> 00:46:56.487
You've been a lot of help today

922
00:46:56.618 --> 00:47:01.710
and my mom says that online
sales are definitely up.


923
00:47:02.798 --> 00:47:04.930
So...
- Well, you're welcome.


924
00:47:05.061 --> 00:47:07.759
You know, I really meant it when
I said you had beautiful store.


925
00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:11.546
I love this place,
so, I'm happy to help.


926
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:18.117
If only we could find out
how the present


927
00:47:18.248 --> 00:47:20.511
made it halfway
across the world.


928
00:47:20.642 --> 00:47:22.339
You know how this works:

929
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:24.211
Anonymous Christmas magic.

930
00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:26.125
I just wish Arjun in India

931
00:47:26.256 --> 00:47:29.172
could talk to a Santa #1
about St. Louis.


932
00:47:29.303 --> 00:47:31.479
Or that one dad could send
the thank you note


933
00:47:31.609 --> 00:47:33.350
about the ukulele
that changed his son's life.


934
00:47:35.047 --> 00:47:36.919
Finish getting ready, okay?

935
00:47:37.049 --> 00:47:38.747
We gotta get you to school.

936
00:47:42.925 --> 00:47:45.188
I think I may actually
like Jason.


937
00:47:48.626 --> 00:47:50.237
Come on in.

938
00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:51.629
I mean, I don't...

939
00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.415
not like him in an epic way.

940
00:47:54.545 --> 00:47:56.199
I felt bad about cancelling,

941
00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:58.070
so I came to your party
to cheer myself up,


942
00:47:58.201 --> 00:47:59.724
not knowing he'd be there.

943
00:47:59.855 --> 00:48:02.858
Then... I saw him.

944
00:48:04.425 --> 00:48:07.166
And then there
was something lively.


945
00:48:07.297 --> 00:48:09.604
And maybe something
sweet about him?


946
00:48:09.734 --> 00:48:12.389
Something I missed earlier?

947
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:15.174
I suppose he's had a few
surprising moments.


948
00:48:15.305 --> 00:48:17.394
Right?!

949
00:48:17.525 --> 00:48:19.570
Anyway, I don't know
if this is good or bad,


950
00:48:19.701 --> 00:48:21.268
cause... you know?

951
00:48:22.791 --> 00:48:24.706
The web of lies.

952
00:48:26.577 --> 00:48:30.233
No, I think that this
is great news.


953
00:48:30.364 --> 00:48:32.714
And if it does work out
with you two, then...


954
00:48:32.844 --> 00:48:35.847
The book did bring you together,
just indirectly.


955
00:48:35.978 --> 00:48:38.850
And this is a thing
we review...


956
00:48:38.981 --> 00:48:40.461
down the road?

957
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:48.295
We cannot deny,
Jason really helped us.


958
00:48:49.339 --> 00:48:50.732
He did.

959
00:48:59.306 --> 00:49:01.177
You didn't tell him, did you?

960
00:49:01.308 --> 00:49:02.439
I couldn't.

961
00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:04.920
I just saw how earnest
he is in his pursuit,


962
00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:06.313
and... I chickened out.

963
00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:09.794
Plus, you know, Zoey says
she may actually be into him.


964
00:49:09.925 --> 00:49:11.883
So, if I told him the truth,
I could ruin things


965
00:49:12.014 --> 00:49:13.320
for both of them.

966
00:49:14.233 --> 00:49:16.584
So, is that it then?

967
00:49:16.714 --> 00:49:18.412
The deal is all done?

968
00:49:18.542 --> 00:49:20.544
Well, he helped us out.

969
00:49:20.675 --> 00:49:23.547
He left Six Degrees alone and...

970
00:49:23.678 --> 00:49:27.856
maybe I didn't connect him
to the real Miss Santa #1...


971
00:49:28.944 --> 00:49:30.946
- You.
- Yes, but I did provide him


972
00:49:31.076 --> 00:49:32.469
with a connection.

973
00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.515
A better one, so...

974
00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.215
He helped McNevin
Paper Company.


975
00:49:40.564 --> 00:49:42.131
Maybe when everything
slows down,


976
00:49:42.261 --> 00:49:44.307
you bring him some of those
pastries you brought in.


977
00:49:44.438 --> 00:49:46.440
A good old-fashioned
thank you, hmm?


978
00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:48.137
Yeah.

979
00:49:56.885 --> 00:49:59.670
Wow, you are bad
at being on hiatus.


980
00:50:00.932 --> 00:50:02.934
Come in.

981
00:50:03.065 --> 00:50:05.241
Yeah, I um...

982
00:50:06.242 --> 00:50:08.462
I don't know where else to go.

983
00:50:08.592 --> 00:50:10.115
Really?

984
00:50:10.246 --> 00:50:12.074
With all your resources?

985
00:50:13.945 --> 00:50:16.731
So, are things back up
and running with Zoey?


986
00:50:18.254 --> 00:50:21.779
Yes, yes. We are getting
dinner tonight, actually.


987
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:23.259
Good.

988
00:50:27.045 --> 00:50:29.308
The book that started it all.

989
00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:34.401
Ah, Luminarias.

990
00:50:35.706 --> 00:50:37.969
You know it means illumination?

991
00:50:39.144 --> 00:50:41.973
Did you know the tradition
stems from small fires


992
00:50:42.104 --> 00:50:44.149
used to guide scouts
and spirits home?


993
00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.064
I did.

994
00:50:46.195 --> 00:50:47.979
- Hmm.
- You should read it.


995
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:49.938
Borrow it and take it home
to Dani.


996
00:50:52.593 --> 00:50:54.725
Uh, well, the reason
I texted you


997
00:50:54.856 --> 00:50:58.163
is I wanted to bring you
these as a thank you.


998
00:50:58.294 --> 00:51:00.601
Sales are definitely up.

999
00:51:00.731 --> 00:51:02.864
Oh, that's great, thank you.

1000
00:51:03.821 --> 00:51:04.953
What are they?

1001
00:51:05.083 --> 00:51:06.476
They're <i>kidyos.</i>

1002
00:51:06.607 --> 00:51:08.957
It's an east Indian
Christmas dessert.


1003
00:51:10.219 --> 00:51:12.700
Dani and I, we have
this little project,


1004
00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:15.180
we read emails we get
from Six Degree Santas,


1005
00:51:15.311 --> 00:51:17.052
and when we get one
from somewhere new,


1006
00:51:17.182 --> 00:51:20.055
we look up their traditions
and we make something.


1007
00:51:20.185 --> 00:51:23.798
And Dani's in charge,
so it's usually sweets.


1008
00:51:25.016 --> 00:51:26.540
Oh, wow,
these are really good.


1009
00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:27.932
Mm-hmm.

1010
00:51:28.063 --> 00:51:30.413
Okay, okay, fine.

1011
00:51:30.544 --> 00:51:32.284
Fine, let's take a stab
at improving


1012
00:51:32.415 --> 00:51:34.417
Six Degrees together.

1013
00:51:34.548 --> 00:51:35.984
What? Really?

1014
00:51:36.114 --> 00:51:37.202
Wait, are you making a joke?

1015
00:51:37.333 --> 00:51:39.074
No, it's...

1016
00:51:39.204 --> 00:51:41.816
Something Dani said
made me reconsider and...


1017
00:51:43.208 --> 00:51:45.994
Well, I suppose you had
a few good points...


1018
00:51:46.124 --> 00:51:48.387
- Mm, yes!
- ...here and there.


1019
00:51:48.518 --> 00:51:50.085
Are you fist pumping
because you're excited


1020
00:51:50.215 --> 00:51:52.130
about connecting people,

1021
00:51:52.261 --> 00:51:54.437
or because you think you won
an ongoing argument?


1022
00:51:55.743 --> 00:51:57.179
Can't it be both?

1023
00:51:59.007 --> 00:52:01.662
Dani, hurry up please!
I gotta go!


1024
00:52:01.792 --> 00:52:03.054
Wow, you put the tree up.

1025
00:52:03.185 --> 00:52:05.404
Ah, yeah.

1026
00:52:05.535 --> 00:52:06.797
Uh, thanks for doing this
so last minute,


1027
00:52:06.928 --> 00:52:08.407
I only need half a day,

1028
00:52:08.538 --> 00:52:10.105
so I can pick up Dani
on the way back.


1029
00:52:10.235 --> 00:52:11.498
Uh, no worries.

1030
00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:13.804
I think it's cool that
you're beefing up Six Degrees.


1031
00:52:13.935 --> 00:52:16.807
Oh, well, let's not get
ahead of ourselves,


1032
00:52:16.938 --> 00:52:18.766
but maybe.

1033
00:52:18.896 --> 00:52:21.029
Uh, quick question.

1034
00:52:21.159 --> 00:52:22.552
You wouldn't happen to be collaborating

1035
00:52:22.683 --> 00:52:25.033
with this fellow, would you?

1036
00:52:28.993 --> 00:52:30.386
I've seen that look.

1037
00:52:31.343 --> 00:52:33.084
I...

1038
00:52:33.215 --> 00:52:35.391
I can't believe you
even follow him.


1039
00:52:35.522 --> 00:52:37.436
Well, he has good
life hacking tips.


1040
00:52:37.567 --> 00:52:39.526
All I'm saying...

1041
00:52:39.656 --> 00:52:42.703
is that I'm sensing a new kind
of energy from you right now.


1042
00:52:42.833 --> 00:52:46.707
It's either this new project,
or Santa Claus here, or both.


1043
00:52:47.795 --> 00:52:49.405
Hey, either way,

1044
00:52:49.536 --> 00:52:51.799
you should let yourself have it.

1045
00:52:51.929 --> 00:52:53.801
Like I said the day,

1046
00:52:53.931 --> 00:52:56.934
I'm putting all of that
on the back-burner.


1047
00:52:57.065 --> 00:53:00.155
And either way,
it's a non-starter,


1048
00:53:00.285 --> 00:53:02.505
because he's dating
my neighbour.


1049
00:53:04.768 --> 00:53:05.900
Oh.

1050
00:53:10.121 --> 00:53:12.384
I think a wall would be
a good middle ground


1051
00:53:12.515 --> 00:53:14.473
for people to post publicly,

1052
00:53:14.604 --> 00:53:17.651
similarly that they would
a product review,


1053
00:53:17.781 --> 00:53:19.653
do you know what I mean?

1054
00:53:19.783 --> 00:53:23.134
Like, "Hey, loved
the reindeer sock puppet,


1055
00:53:23.265 --> 00:53:25.572
would Santa #1
like to come forward?"


1056
00:53:25.702 --> 00:53:28.183
You know?
- Yeah, but that's where


1057
00:53:28.313 --> 00:53:30.359
the whole social media
element could go wrong,


1058
00:53:30.489 --> 00:53:33.884
you know? It could lead
to competing and outdoing...


1059
00:53:37.671 --> 00:53:39.194
Is that Zoey?

1060
00:53:40.761 --> 00:53:44.112
No, it's, um,
it's Fabian Lambert,


1061
00:53:44.242 --> 00:53:46.114
you know, the celebrity chef?

1062
00:53:46.244 --> 00:53:48.551
I hired him for a bake sale fundraiser

1063
00:53:48.682 --> 00:53:50.379
for this high school
basketball team,


1064
00:53:50.509 --> 00:53:52.076
no cause too small.

1065
00:53:53.425 --> 00:53:56.080
No, Zoey is away for the day,
she's doing some


1066
00:53:56.211 --> 00:53:59.867
Business Ladies Who Craft,
or something? I don't know.


1067
00:53:59.997 --> 00:54:02.609
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

1068
00:54:03.566 --> 00:54:06.917
Yeah, um, right. Um, okay...

1069
00:54:07.048 --> 00:54:10.355
So what if you're a young girl
who gets gifted,


1070
00:54:10.486 --> 00:54:12.793
um, you know, a hacky sack?

1071
00:54:12.923 --> 00:54:16.710
And then you look online
and then you start to see the...


1072
00:54:18.494 --> 00:54:20.235
I am so sorry.

1073
00:54:20.365 --> 00:54:22.237
Let me just finish this up
and we can focus, okay?


1074
00:54:22.367 --> 00:54:23.630
Sure.

1075
00:54:27.851 --> 00:54:29.723
Hey, what flavour
sounds better to you,


1076
00:54:29.853 --> 00:54:31.507
lavender or cardamom?

1077
00:54:32.595 --> 00:54:34.684
For a Christmas thing?

1078
00:54:34.815 --> 00:54:36.773
I'll just tell him
to do both.


1079
00:54:36.904 --> 00:54:40.429
Ooh, how about this?
Maple gelatin caviar?


1080
00:54:40.559 --> 00:54:41.952
That seems kind of seasonal, right?

1081
00:54:42.083 --> 00:54:43.824
For a bake sale.

1082
00:54:43.954 --> 00:54:45.695
Why are you getting

1083
00:54:45.826 --> 00:54:47.828
molecular gastronomy
involved in this?


1084
00:54:47.958 --> 00:54:50.047
It's just what Fabian does.

1085
00:54:50.178 --> 00:54:51.701
It'll be very
high-profile stuff.


1086
00:54:51.832 --> 00:54:54.835
It's for a high school
bake sale.


1087
00:54:54.965 --> 00:54:57.620
I mean, what is it that
you've been going for


1088
00:54:57.751 --> 00:55:01.189
brand-wise lately?
Down to earth and sincere?


1089
00:55:02.059 --> 00:55:03.582
Uh-huh.

1090
00:55:03.713 --> 00:55:05.584
I've got a great idea.

1091
00:55:05.715 --> 00:55:07.021
Get your coat.

1092
00:55:13.288 --> 00:55:15.116
Trust me, this is going
to be great marketing.


1093
00:55:15.246 --> 00:55:17.422
For this bake sale,
Jason Sparks doesn't just


1094
00:55:17.553 --> 00:55:20.512
throw money at it, no, no,
he puts his back into it.


1095
00:55:20.643 --> 00:55:22.950
He's just like us.

1096
00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:24.473
Well, that's great,

1097
00:55:24.603 --> 00:55:28.216
but cooking isn't exactly
in my skill set.


1098
00:55:28.346 --> 00:55:31.132
Hmm. Well, I'm gonna teach you

1099
00:55:31.262 --> 00:55:34.309
how to make my dad's molasses
spice cookies.


1100
00:55:34.439 --> 00:55:36.354
They're world-famous.

1101
00:55:36.485 --> 00:55:39.923
And my world famous I mean that
they are Dani's favourite, so...


1102
00:55:40.054 --> 00:55:42.970
You have to wear this.

1103
00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:44.798
Okay.

1104
00:55:44.928 --> 00:55:46.408
Thank you.

1105
00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:50.455
Not bad, not bad. Okay.

1106
00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:01.118
So with this, you want to stir
it seven times clockwise


1107
00:56:01.249 --> 00:56:03.207
and three times
counter-clockwise


1108
00:56:03.338 --> 00:56:04.295
and repeat it four times.

1109
00:56:04.426 --> 00:56:06.167
Uh, okay...

1110
00:56:09.474 --> 00:56:12.739
Hey, wait a second! You guys
are pulling my leg, I knew it.


1111
00:56:14.175 --> 00:56:15.829
Okay, so then you're gonna
use spoons...


1112
00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:21.965
Yeah, put your back into it.

1113
00:56:22.096 --> 00:56:23.184
That's it.

1114
00:56:23.314 --> 00:56:25.273
And right next to it?

1115
00:56:25.403 --> 00:56:28.493
Actually, if you turn this
upside down, then right side up,


1116
00:56:28.624 --> 00:56:31.453
you get more cookies.
- Oh, clever.


1117
00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:35.457
Alright. Sweetie,
it's time for you to go


1118
00:56:35.587 --> 00:56:37.372
get ready for your
grandma's sleepover.


1119
00:56:37.502 --> 00:56:39.678
And yes, you can take
some cookies with you.


1120
00:56:41.463 --> 00:56:43.073
Thanks, Mom.

1121
00:56:43.204 --> 00:56:45.859
Hey, you know what? I think
we made some darn good cookies


1122
00:56:45.989 --> 00:56:48.339
here tonight, let's have it,
up top, come on.


1123
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:52.169
Alright. Oh yeah, yeah,
there we go.


1124
00:56:57.174 --> 00:56:59.176
It was really nice hanging out
with Dani today.


1125
00:56:59.307 --> 00:57:01.048
Isn't she the best?

1126
00:57:01.178 --> 00:57:03.050
She is.

1127
00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.703
Thank you.

1128
00:57:06.183 --> 00:57:10.187
As a matter of fact,
I'm thinking of recruiting her


1129
00:57:10.318 --> 00:57:14.235
as my decorative consultant
for SparkLTree 2.0.


1130
00:57:14.365 --> 00:57:17.151
Well, good luck with that,

1131
00:57:17.281 --> 00:57:19.153
you know,
because she's an artist,


1132
00:57:19.283 --> 00:57:23.548
so her approach is pure
and can't be commercialized.


1133
00:57:23.679 --> 00:57:26.160
We'll see about that.

1134
00:57:27.857 --> 00:57:29.772
So, um...

1135
00:57:31.121 --> 00:57:33.384
is Dani's father
in the picture?


1136
00:57:33.515 --> 00:57:35.865
Yeah, Derrick.

1137
00:57:35.996 --> 00:57:38.781
Um, actually, he lives
in New York City


1138
00:57:38.912 --> 00:57:42.437
and he's one of the reasons
that we moved back here.


1139
00:57:43.655 --> 00:57:45.179
And you guys get along,
you're doing


1140
00:57:45.309 --> 00:57:46.745
the co-parenting thing?

1141
00:57:46.876 --> 00:57:48.835
Yeah, we do.

1142
00:57:48.965 --> 00:57:52.229
And you know, we were just
better off as friends and...


1143
00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:54.144
well, we respect each other,
and I...


1144
00:57:54.275 --> 00:57:55.929
I think that's important.

1145
00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:00.934
So...

1146
00:58:01.064 --> 00:58:02.500
what about you?

1147
00:58:02.631 --> 00:58:05.199
What's your story?

1148
00:58:06.896 --> 00:58:08.245
Um...

1149
00:58:09.899 --> 00:58:12.119
Well, uh,

1150
00:58:12.249 --> 00:58:13.947
I suppose I used to spend
a lot of time bouncing


1151
00:58:14.077 --> 00:58:16.558
from project to project,

1152
00:58:16.688 --> 00:58:19.126
and with my relationships,

1153
00:58:19.256 --> 00:58:22.433
I was always weighing
the risks versus reward.


1154
00:58:22.564 --> 00:58:25.567
And often it seemed easier
to just move on.


1155
00:58:27.264 --> 00:58:31.486
But then you begin to realize
that something's missing,


1156
00:58:31.616 --> 00:58:33.488
which is why I had such
a strong reaction


1157
00:58:33.618 --> 00:58:35.882
to Northbound Elf
showing up in my life again.


1158
00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:38.623
You know what's odd?

1159
00:58:40.103 --> 00:58:42.714
I still don't really feel
that Zoey matches the book


1160
00:58:42.845 --> 00:58:44.412
or the feeling in the note

1161
00:58:44.542 --> 00:58:45.630
and certainly not
the feeling I had


1162
00:58:45.761 --> 00:58:48.242
when the book showed up
on my doorstep. I mean...


1163
00:58:51.071 --> 00:58:52.724
Listen, I know how silly

1164
00:58:52.855 --> 00:58:55.162
this sounds, all this
over a children's book.


1165
00:58:55.292 --> 00:58:57.338
No, it's not.

1166
00:58:57.468 --> 00:58:58.905
It's not silly.

1167
00:59:01.472 --> 00:59:02.909
Actually, um...

1168
00:59:04.214 --> 00:59:05.607
I have to tell you something.

1169
00:59:09.741 --> 00:59:12.788
Um, I know Northbound Elf.

1170
00:59:14.964 --> 00:59:18.925
Yeah, it was an important part
of my childhood too.


1171
00:59:19.055 --> 00:59:22.667
It inspired Six Degrees
a little.


1172
00:59:22.798 --> 00:59:25.583
I guess what I'm trying
to say is,


1173
00:59:25.714 --> 00:59:29.152
when you talk about
how important it is to you,


1174
00:59:29.283 --> 00:59:30.806
I understand.

1175
00:59:34.592 --> 00:59:36.681
Why didn't you tell me this?

1176
00:59:38.205 --> 00:59:40.468
Well, I suppose I didn't see
you as an ally at first.


1177
00:59:45.168 --> 00:59:47.562
I mean, why would I share
that part of myself with you?


1178
00:59:50.826 --> 00:59:52.654
I can understand that.

1179
00:59:54.351 --> 00:59:56.397
But you know, for somebody
who has a lot to say


1180
00:59:56.527 --> 00:59:58.660
about human connection,
you sure do keep a lot


1181
00:59:58.790 --> 01:00:00.488
about yourself under lockdown.

1182
01:00:02.229 --> 01:00:04.361
Might be something
I have to work on, I guess.


1183
01:00:07.321 --> 01:00:09.801
So, Mr. Big Tech Entrepreneur

1184
01:00:09.932 --> 01:00:12.935
who, you know, occasionally
burns batches of cookies.


1185
01:00:13.066 --> 01:00:14.502
Um...

1186
01:00:16.025 --> 01:00:18.288
what do you say we have
a little fun?


1187
01:00:21.596 --> 01:00:24.164
So, roller-skating, huh?

1188
01:00:24.294 --> 01:00:26.905
Not ice skating?
Isn't that more seasonal?


1189
01:00:27.036 --> 01:00:30.953
Well, this is indoors,
therefore, anytime.


1190
01:00:32.650 --> 01:00:34.739
You know, I used to skate around
this store when I was younger,


1191
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:36.350
but then I remembered this place

1192
01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.917
and that you have
nighttime access.


1193
01:00:39.048 --> 01:00:41.311
I see.

1194
01:00:41.442 --> 01:00:44.358
We can skate through a forest
of Christmas trees.


1195
01:00:45.272 --> 01:00:46.882
SparkLTrees.

1196
01:00:47.013 --> 01:00:49.754
Yeah, SparkLTrees.

1197
01:00:49.885 --> 01:00:51.756
We should play some music.

1198
01:00:51.887 --> 01:00:54.150
SparkLTree comes with
a free app


1199
01:00:54.281 --> 01:00:56.761
featuring such things
as tree care instructions


1200
01:00:56.892 --> 01:00:58.937
and such playlists as

1201
01:00:59.068 --> 01:01:00.939
"Music to Open Presents to."
- Ooh.


1202
01:01:01.070 --> 01:01:02.289
"Dancing around
the Christmas Tree."


1203
01:01:02.419 --> 01:01:03.246
Mm-hmm.

1204
01:01:03.377 --> 01:01:05.683
"Falling in Love
at Christmas."


1205
01:01:06.815 --> 01:01:08.817
You should save
that one for Zoey.


1206
01:01:19.088 --> 01:01:20.437
Okay.

1207
01:01:20.568 --> 01:01:22.265
So, I know this
is supposed to be


1208
01:01:22.396 --> 01:01:24.137
a stress-relieving activity,

1209
01:01:24.267 --> 01:01:27.009
so I promise not to make fun
of you if you wobble,


1210
01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:29.098
as long as you promise

1211
01:01:29.229 --> 01:01:31.013
not to make fun of my wobbles.
Yeah?


1212
01:01:31.144 --> 01:01:32.928
- Deal.
- Deal.


1213
01:01:34.495 --> 01:01:35.757
I can see why you would make
assumptions about me


1214
01:01:35.887 --> 01:01:38.238
given that I am
a techie-numbers guy.


1215
01:01:38.368 --> 01:01:41.284
- Mm-hmm.
- And by numbers guy I mean...


1216
01:01:42.329 --> 01:01:44.505
...number one skater
in the entire lobby.


1217
01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:48.509
Whew.
- What?!


1218
01:01:48.639 --> 01:01:50.250
You tricked me.

1219
01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:53.427
- You underestimated me.
- Seems I have.


1220
01:01:56.821 --> 01:01:58.258
Okay.

1221
01:01:58.388 --> 01:02:00.564
Okay, what you got then?
- Yeah?


1222
01:02:00.695 --> 01:02:02.479
Come on, here we go.

1223
01:02:02.610 --> 01:02:04.264
There we go.

1224
01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:08.094
There you go, there you go.

1225
01:02:09.007 --> 01:02:11.445
Whew!

1226
01:02:14.361 --> 01:02:16.232
Go on, then.
- I'll spin around ya.


1227
01:02:16.363 --> 01:02:18.843
- Yeah?
- Whew!


1228
01:02:22.847 --> 01:02:25.546
Oh!

1229
01:02:32.596 --> 01:02:34.990
Ah!

1230
01:02:36.122 --> 01:02:37.253
Are you happy?

1231
01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:45.000
<i>Happy holidays!</i>

1232
01:02:45.131 --> 01:02:48.525
<i>We hope you enjoyed this music
along with your SparkLTree,</i>


1233
01:02:48.656 --> 01:02:51.398
<i>and that you sparkle
all the way.</i>


1234
01:02:54.314 --> 01:02:57.055
I wanted your opinion
on something


1235
01:02:57.186 --> 01:02:59.145
as a potential
SparkLTree customer.


1236
01:03:00.711 --> 01:03:03.453
Okay, not even a potential
SparkLTree customer,


1237
01:03:03.584 --> 01:03:05.020
but how can I help?

1238
01:03:13.071 --> 01:03:14.725
I thought we'd do a little
quality control check


1239
01:03:14.856 --> 01:03:16.249
from this angle.

1240
01:03:16.379 --> 01:03:17.946
Well, this is how
the kids see it.


1241
01:03:18.076 --> 01:03:19.861
Exactly.

1242
01:03:21.428 --> 01:03:23.256
I used to love doing this
when I was a kid.


1243
01:03:25.388 --> 01:03:26.955
So, uh,

1244
01:03:27.085 --> 01:03:29.914
what made you move
towards agriculture?


1245
01:03:30.045 --> 01:03:32.178
What inspired SparkLTree?

1246
01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:35.529
My uncle.

1247
01:03:37.008 --> 01:03:39.315
Yeah, we were always very close.

1248
01:03:39.446 --> 01:03:41.622
In fact, he was the one that
gave me Northbound Elf


1249
01:03:41.752 --> 01:03:43.276
when I was a kid.

1250
01:03:46.496 --> 01:03:48.542
After my parents passed away
when I was in grad school,


1251
01:03:48.672 --> 01:03:50.892
he became the family that
I would spend Christmas with.


1252
01:03:52.285 --> 01:03:54.722
One year, I visited him
on Christmas Eve.


1253
01:03:56.245 --> 01:03:58.639
And I had been working
like crazy,


1254
01:03:58.769 --> 01:04:01.772
he had hurt his back
and he was living alone


1255
01:04:01.903 --> 01:04:03.644
and didn't have
a Christmas tree.


1256
01:04:04.688 --> 01:04:05.820
It broke my heart.

1257
01:04:07.691 --> 01:04:09.911
I started thinking, if we can
get everything else delivered,


1258
01:04:10.041 --> 01:04:12.000
then why not a Christmas tree?

1259
01:04:12.130 --> 01:04:14.394
And not just if you live
near a farm, you know?


1260
01:04:15.699 --> 01:04:18.441
So, I partnered
with some farmers


1261
01:04:18.572 --> 01:04:20.095
who were struggling
to stay in business


1262
01:04:20.226 --> 01:04:23.098
and invited them to participate.

1263
01:04:24.055 --> 01:04:25.405
Worked out well for everyone.

1264
01:04:26.971 --> 01:04:30.758
What... So, SparkLTrees
actually helps the farmers?


1265
01:04:31.759 --> 01:04:33.021
Yeah, of course.

1266
01:04:33.151 --> 01:04:35.763
I needed their skills
and they were helped by mine.


1267
01:04:38.156 --> 01:04:39.680
Wow.

1268
01:04:41.247 --> 01:04:43.423
Here I was, being such a...

1269
01:04:44.554 --> 01:04:45.860
brat...

1270
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:47.601
...about everything.

1271
01:04:49.429 --> 01:04:50.691
It's fine, I'm used
to people jumping


1272
01:04:50.821 --> 01:04:52.258
to the worst conclusions.

1273
01:04:56.784 --> 01:04:59.134
You know, the other beautiful
thing about SparkLTree?


1274
01:05:01.441 --> 01:05:03.312
It's extremely profitable
as an untapped part


1275
01:05:03.443 --> 01:05:06.010
of the Christmas market.
- Oh... You--


1276
01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:24.290
It's Zoey.

1277
01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:29.251
Well, that's... that's good.

1278
01:05:29.382 --> 01:05:30.992
That's a good thing.

1279
01:05:34.517 --> 01:05:36.824
We should probably
call it a night.


1280
01:05:43.134 --> 01:05:45.441
Okay, regarding Six Degrees,

1281
01:05:45.572 --> 01:05:48.314
and I know I'm supposed
to be on hiatus here.


1282
01:05:51.882 --> 01:05:56.234
I don't know how to explain it,
this feels personal.


1283
01:05:56.365 --> 01:05:58.933
Fun, I mean...

1284
01:05:59.063 --> 01:06:01.414
<i>It feels like a field trip.
I don't know.</i>


1285
01:06:01.544 --> 01:06:03.938
Okay, do you want me
to have Leon start


1286
01:06:04.068 --> 01:06:05.243
printing you out the paperwork?
- Yes, but not


1287
01:06:05.374 --> 01:06:06.810
the typical paperwork.

1288
01:06:06.941 --> 01:06:08.856
I'd like to get the copyright
process started,


1289
01:06:08.986 --> 01:06:10.510
fast-tracked out if possible.

1290
01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.033
<i>So, we are looking
at a takeover?</i>


1291
01:06:12.163 --> 01:06:15.428
No. No, no, no.
This is just protective.


1292
01:06:15.558 --> 01:06:17.821
And find a team of coders
looking to make


1293
01:06:17.952 --> 01:06:19.345
<i>some holiday pay.</i>

1294
01:06:19.475 --> 01:06:22.913
I'll also keep trying to track
down copies of Northbound Elf.


1295
01:06:23.044 --> 01:06:24.350
Is it okay for me
to use your handle


1296
01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.655
to really get it out there?

1297
01:06:25.786 --> 01:06:27.353
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

1298
01:06:28.223 --> 01:06:29.529
Although...

1299
01:06:32.836 --> 01:06:34.621
...may have a better angle.

1300
01:06:36.536 --> 01:06:38.233
Hmm.

1301
01:06:41.932 --> 01:06:43.717
I couldn't help but notice
that your dad's


1302
01:06:43.847 --> 01:06:46.328
molasses spiced cookies
are trending.


1303
01:06:46.459 --> 01:06:47.634
What?

1304
01:06:47.764 --> 01:06:52.421
Oh, yeah Jason had this
fundraiser emergency,


1305
01:06:52.552 --> 01:06:56.338
so I convinced him
to bake himself.


1306
01:06:56.469 --> 01:06:58.601
It was fun

1307
01:06:58.732 --> 01:07:00.864
watching him try to work
a rolling pin.


1308
01:07:00.995 --> 01:07:05.869
Oh, is this part of the deal
or a distraction tactic?


1309
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.568
No, it just sort of happened.

1310
01:07:11.048 --> 01:07:13.399
I'm letting him help me
with Six Degrees.


1311
01:07:15.052 --> 01:07:16.706
You must really trust him.

1312
01:07:16.837 --> 01:07:18.404
I do.

1313
01:07:20.057 --> 01:07:22.190
I just wish he had a reason
to trust me back.


1314
01:07:23.234 --> 01:07:25.759
I wish I'd come clean earlier.

1315
01:07:25.889 --> 01:07:29.197
Now I'm in this... pickle,

1316
01:07:29.327 --> 01:07:31.025
as you like to say.

1317
01:07:32.896 --> 01:07:35.159
It turns out Jason Sparks
is a...


1318
01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:36.596
is a good guy.

1319
01:07:37.945 --> 01:07:40.295
Earnestly looking
for something real.


1320
01:07:42.515 --> 01:07:44.430
What if he has found it?

1321
01:07:45.909 --> 01:07:48.216
With the real Miss Santa #1?

1322
01:07:49.435 --> 01:07:51.393
What if you went ahead
and told him?


1323
01:07:51.524 --> 01:07:55.789
No. If I told him,
he'd be mad, and upset.


1324
01:07:56.877 --> 01:07:58.966
And it would ruin
things for everyone.


1325
01:07:59.096 --> 01:08:02.491
Him, me, and Zoey.

1326
01:08:02.622 --> 01:08:04.798
And I still have Dani
to think of.


1327
01:08:06.147 --> 01:08:08.366
You know, what if this journey
of his is...


1328
01:08:08.497 --> 01:08:10.194
is just a phase?

1329
01:08:10.325 --> 01:08:12.414
You know,
like I originally thought.


1330
01:08:12.545 --> 01:08:15.199
Looks like you have thought
of all the possible


1331
01:08:15.330 --> 01:08:17.158
bad outcomes.

1332
01:08:17.288 --> 01:08:19.465
Which is the sensible thing.

1333
01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.989
No, I think that this is best.

1334
01:08:23.381 --> 01:08:25.340
It means the least number
of people get hurt.


1335
01:08:27.081 --> 01:08:30.084
Either way, he'll fall so in
love with Zoey it won't matter.


1336
01:08:30.214 --> 01:08:32.042
Or...

1337
01:08:32.173 --> 01:08:35.263
He'll forget and move on
to the next thing.


1338
01:08:36.133 --> 01:08:38.353
What about your feelings?

1339
01:08:39.441 --> 01:08:40.834
I'll get past it.

1340
01:08:42.966 --> 01:08:45.099
I have a lot
that's good in life.


1341
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:51.584
...that your book,
Northbound Elf,


1342
01:08:51.714 --> 01:08:54.761
meant the world
to me when I was young,


1343
01:08:54.891 --> 01:08:57.503
and recently came back
into my life in a very...


1344
01:08:57.633 --> 01:09:00.027
auspicious and unexpected way.

1345
01:09:00.157 --> 01:09:02.508
I have searched high and low

1346
01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:04.945
and I am astounded at how hard
it is to find a copy,


1347
01:09:05.075 --> 01:09:06.424
and I recently discovered
it's been out of print


1348
01:09:06.555 --> 01:09:07.643
since the 90s?

1349
01:09:07.774 --> 01:09:09.036
It wasn't a big seller.

1350
01:09:09.166 --> 01:09:10.690
Well, let me tell you
from experience,


1351
01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:12.692
the world was missing out.

1352
01:09:12.822 --> 01:09:15.782
Now, I'm somebody
who's fortunate enough


1353
01:09:15.912 --> 01:09:18.567
to be in a position
to bring it back.


1354
01:09:19.525 --> 01:09:22.049
And it's actually
gaining momentum


1355
01:09:22.179 --> 01:09:24.530
since I posted about it online.

1356
01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:26.444
Here, have a look at this.

1357
01:09:26.575 --> 01:09:28.882
You're trending.
Do you believe that?


1358
01:09:32.189 --> 01:09:34.540
Is this something you might
consider bringing back to life?


1359
01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:38.892
This offer's come up before.

1360
01:09:39.022 --> 01:09:41.285
And from what I understand,

1361
01:09:41.416 --> 01:09:43.940
republishing isn't fiscally advantageous

1362
01:09:44.071 --> 01:09:46.290
unless a substantial
part of it is digital.


1363
01:09:46.421 --> 01:09:49.729
And that just
doesn't feel right.


1364
01:09:49.859 --> 01:09:52.427
I was thinking, print only,

1365
01:09:52.558 --> 01:09:55.909
hard back,
for that exact same reason.


1366
01:09:58.564 --> 01:10:00.522
- I'm trending, am I?
- Yes, you are.


1367
01:10:09.313 --> 01:10:12.578
Gosh, thanks for walking me
all this way.


1368
01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:15.145
You're like a real... gentleman.

1369
01:10:16.930 --> 01:10:18.322
This is me.

1370
01:10:18.453 --> 01:10:20.063
Yes, I know.

1371
01:10:20.194 --> 01:10:22.936
I was here the other night,
baking up a storm.


1372
01:10:23.066 --> 01:10:24.677
Harper helped you
with that bake sale?


1373
01:10:24.807 --> 01:10:26.287
Yeah.

1374
01:10:26.417 --> 01:10:28.637
And this whole time I thought
you came with cooking skills.


1375
01:10:30.291 --> 01:10:31.597
Guess I usually hire
people for that.


1376
01:10:33.033 --> 01:10:35.078
So, um,

1377
01:10:35.209 --> 01:10:36.340
I'll see you tomorrow?

1378
01:10:36.471 --> 01:10:37.907
Christmas Eve?

1379
01:10:38.038 --> 01:10:40.127
- I'd like that.
- Okay.


1380
01:11:05.021 --> 01:11:06.632
It's you.

1381
01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:09.809
- Yeah, hi.
- Ah.


1382
01:11:09.939 --> 01:11:11.985
Oh wait, are you Leonard?

1383
01:11:12.115 --> 01:11:13.813
- I certainly am.
- No way,


1384
01:11:13.943 --> 01:11:16.467
we were just talking about you.
That's so crazy.


1385
01:11:16.598 --> 01:11:18.078
You're like Cupid, you know?

1386
01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:20.254
You know, part of
the Six Degrees of Santa chain


1387
01:11:20.384 --> 01:11:22.343
that brought us together.
- Guilty as charged.


1388
01:11:23.561 --> 01:11:25.389
You know, I figured
that out also.


1389
01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.262
You know, I follow you
on social media.


1390
01:11:28.392 --> 01:11:30.525
- Yeah? Oh.
- My son works in tech


1391
01:11:30.656 --> 01:11:33.876
so I gotta stay up on things,
you know?


1392
01:11:34.007 --> 01:11:36.183
I saw the pictures
of the two of you


1393
01:11:36.313 --> 01:11:38.359
and the post about
the Northbound Elf.


1394
01:11:38.489 --> 01:11:40.796
I put two and two together.

1395
01:11:40.927 --> 01:11:43.059
Santa #2.

1396
01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:47.237
I'm glad you found each other,
but you better treat her right,


1397
01:11:47.368 --> 01:11:49.065
because she's one
of the good ones.


1398
01:11:49.196 --> 01:11:51.111
And her daughter too. So sweet.

1399
01:11:51.241 --> 01:11:53.635
Wait, daughter?

1400
01:11:54.767 --> 01:11:56.507
- Yeah.
- Who are you talking about?


1401
01:11:57.639 --> 01:11:59.902
Uh, Harper
and her daughter Dani.


1402
01:12:00.033 --> 01:12:02.644
Oh, yeah, no. Wrong person.

1403
01:12:02.775 --> 01:12:05.168
So, uh, Harper started
Six Degrees of Santa,


1404
01:12:05.299 --> 01:12:08.258
but the original Santa
in our chain was Zoey.


1405
01:12:08.389 --> 01:12:13.133
Okay, I hate to quibble,
but I'm positive.


1406
01:12:13.263 --> 01:12:17.833
Yeah, Harper McNevin,
Santa #1 in 32A,


1407
01:12:17.964 --> 01:12:21.315
left Northbound Elf
in my car right here.


1408
01:13:12.279 --> 01:13:14.542
One sec.

1409
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.241
Hello.
<i>- Hey.</i>


1410
01:13:18.372 --> 01:13:21.288
Harper, it's Elliott,
Jason Spark's assistant.


1411
01:13:21.418 --> 01:13:22.942
Yeah, I know who you are.

1412
01:13:23.072 --> 01:13:26.206
Um, Merry Christmas Eve Eve.

1413
01:13:26.336 --> 01:13:29.122
<i>Sorry, I'm just a little
out of sorts.</i>


1414
01:13:29.252 --> 01:13:32.255
Uh... I'm calling because...

1415
01:13:32.386 --> 01:13:34.083
Have you by chance spoken
to Jason at all today?


1416
01:13:34.214 --> 01:13:35.650
To Jason?

1417
01:13:35.781 --> 01:13:38.392
No, no, we haven't spoken
since yesterday.


1418
01:13:38.522 --> 01:13:40.046
<i>Maybe he's with Zoey.</i>

1419
01:13:42.396 --> 01:13:45.268
Well, I haven't been able
to reach him all evening,


1420
01:13:45.399 --> 01:13:49.098
which is unusual, so,
I just started to worry.


1421
01:13:49.229 --> 01:13:52.188
Um, if you happen to see him,
can you just tell him


1422
01:13:52.319 --> 01:13:54.277
I have a few important updates
on the Six Degrees domain?


1423
01:13:54.408 --> 01:13:57.411
<i>Also, he'll definitely be able
to fast-track securing</i>


1424
01:13:57.541 --> 01:13:59.152
<i>the copyright, so,
no need to worry about--</i>


1425
01:13:59.282 --> 01:14:02.416
Wait, copyright?
From My Six Degrees?


1426
01:14:02.546 --> 01:14:03.896
That's the one.

1427
01:14:04.026 --> 01:14:05.375
<i>Unless there's two?</i>

1428
01:14:05.506 --> 01:14:07.508
No, I never agreed
to any of that.


1429
01:14:07.638 --> 01:14:09.510
I can't believe that Jason...

1430
01:14:22.001 --> 01:14:23.263
Harper...

1431
01:14:23.393 --> 01:14:25.134
So, I guess you're just
gonna do whatever you want


1432
01:14:25.265 --> 01:14:26.701
with Six Degrees?

1433
01:14:28.007 --> 01:14:29.051
What are you talking about?

1434
01:14:29.182 --> 01:14:31.662
Well, Elliott called me,
looking for you,


1435
01:14:31.793 --> 01:14:34.274
and I guess, well,
he let the cat out of the bag.


1436
01:14:34.404 --> 01:14:37.799
Something about
copyright and Six Degrees.


1437
01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:40.541
Wait, look, I know this
may look bad, but it's--


1438
01:14:40.671 --> 01:14:42.804
No, I just don't know
what's worse.


1439
01:14:42.935 --> 01:14:44.893
If this was part of your plan
all along


1440
01:14:45.024 --> 01:14:46.982
or if you just couldn't
help yourself.


1441
01:14:47.113 --> 01:14:49.202
I thought we made a deal.

1442
01:14:50.116 --> 01:14:52.118
Did we have a deal?

1443
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:55.948
You mean the deal where
you help me find Miss Santa #1


1444
01:14:56.078 --> 01:14:57.688
and then I help you
with your shop


1445
01:14:57.819 --> 01:14:59.516
and leave your site alone?

1446
01:15:00.866 --> 01:15:02.824
Well, you didn't hold up
your end of the deal.


1447
01:15:02.955 --> 01:15:04.739
So it looks like
we're in a grey area.


1448
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:06.219
Grey area?

1449
01:15:06.349 --> 01:15:08.482
No, I connected you to Zoey,

1450
01:15:08.612 --> 01:15:10.397
I did my part,
and I found your...


1451
01:15:10.527 --> 01:15:12.051
your person.

1452
01:15:13.835 --> 01:15:15.576
That's not who you found.

1453
01:15:17.708 --> 01:15:20.059
I know Zoey is not
Miss Santa #1.


1454
01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:30.591
Okay, yeah, um, you're right.

1455
01:15:32.593 --> 01:15:33.899
I'm sorry.

1456
01:15:35.813 --> 01:15:37.598
Is there anything else
you'd like to confess?


1457
01:15:40.601 --> 01:15:42.429
Yeah, it's just,
the thing is...


1458
01:15:44.518 --> 01:15:47.608
Um, I thought that
you and Zoey...


1459
01:15:50.263 --> 01:15:52.787
I meant to tell you
that it wasn't her.


1460
01:15:54.441 --> 01:15:57.357
But then it seemed that you guys
might be good for each other


1461
01:15:57.487 --> 01:16:00.186
and... I didn't want
to interfere with that.


1462
01:16:02.971 --> 01:16:04.842
And...

1463
01:16:04.973 --> 01:16:07.628
you needed me to hold up
my end of the deal.


1464
01:16:08.368 --> 01:16:10.979
Yeah. Yeah.

1465
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:13.068
I needed help
with the paper company


1466
01:16:13.199 --> 01:16:15.375
and I wanted you to leave
Six Degrees alone.


1467
01:16:16.767 --> 01:16:19.814
Well, mission accomplished.

1468
01:16:21.207 --> 01:16:22.817
You don't have to worry
about Six Degrees.


1469
01:16:28.692 --> 01:16:30.042
I think you should go.

1470
01:16:35.699 --> 01:16:40.139
You know, I know I may not
have been on all the up and up.


1471
01:16:42.010 --> 01:16:43.969
But Zoey's great.

1472
01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.973
And I think you deserve
someone great too.


1473
01:17:04.641 --> 01:17:05.991
Ooh.

1474
01:17:08.428 --> 01:17:11.300
Ooh.
- Ah.


1475
01:17:11.431 --> 01:17:13.172
Another one for the books.

1476
01:17:14.825 --> 01:17:17.959
What are you so absorbed in?

1477
01:17:18.090 --> 01:17:20.048
I'm just getting more and more
of these emails


1478
01:17:20.179 --> 01:17:22.572
from Six Degrees people.
Like, look!


1479
01:17:22.703 --> 01:17:24.922
"Thank you for
the Christmas magic."


1480
01:17:25.053 --> 01:17:28.274
<i>"Konichiwa</i>
from Six Degrees Kyoto,


1481
01:17:28.404 --> 01:17:30.015
please tell my Santa #1

1482
01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:32.017
that their gift
changed my life."


1483
01:17:33.409 --> 01:17:35.498
I'm seeing now that
there's such a yearning


1484
01:17:35.629 --> 01:17:37.370
to connect to each other.

1485
01:17:40.721 --> 01:17:43.376
Am I limiting the joy
of this project?


1486
01:17:43.506 --> 01:17:45.987
Maybe Jason was right.

1487
01:17:47.206 --> 01:17:48.642
I thought he was helping you.

1488
01:17:50.513 --> 01:17:52.385
I wasn't really letting him.

1489
01:17:53.951 --> 01:17:57.259
We had a big fight.

1490
01:17:57.390 --> 01:17:59.957
And mostly because I was trying

1491
01:18:00.088 --> 01:18:02.743
to protect Six Degrees,
you know? And for what?


1492
01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:05.050
It just seems so silly now.

1493
01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:11.230
Now I've missed out
on two great things.


1494
01:18:16.235 --> 01:18:18.585
I tell you what
I won't miss out on...


1495
01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:22.067
That holiday casserole of yours.

1496
01:18:23.416 --> 01:18:25.157
Come on, let's get packed up.

1497
01:18:25.287 --> 01:18:26.593
Okay.

1498
01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:35.341
And that's how I found out
that you were not Santa #1.


1499
01:18:36.777 --> 01:18:39.649
It feels good to have
this weight off my chest.


1500
01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:43.697
Also, I'm so sorry about taking
advantage of your social media.


1501
01:18:44.828 --> 01:18:47.483
But I gotta say,
it's been life-changing.


1502
01:18:47.614 --> 01:18:49.311
It's no problem, really.

1503
01:18:49.442 --> 01:18:51.270
And I can keep that up,
it's easy.


1504
01:18:55.361 --> 01:18:56.449
You seem off.

1505
01:18:57.363 --> 01:18:59.016
Is everything okay?

1506
01:18:59.147 --> 01:19:01.062
I mean, the past week
of lies aside.


1507
01:19:04.283 --> 01:19:06.372
I know Harper
is Miss Santa #1.


1508
01:19:06.502 --> 01:19:09.462
What?! No way!

1509
01:19:12.552 --> 01:19:13.292
I know.

1510
01:19:17.165 --> 01:19:18.514
Now all the weight's
off my chest.


1511
01:19:22.214 --> 01:19:24.129
To be fair, we were all
knotted up about it.


1512
01:19:25.347 --> 01:19:27.654
At some point,
we just found ourselves


1513
01:19:27.784 --> 01:19:29.046
at this point of no return.

1514
01:19:29.177 --> 01:19:30.396
Mm-hmm.

1515
01:19:34.661 --> 01:19:37.142
Elliott, what are you doing
here?


1516
01:19:37.272 --> 01:19:39.056
I am so sorry to interrupt.

1517
01:19:39.187 --> 01:19:41.972
I saw this reservation
in your calendar


1518
01:19:42.103 --> 01:19:44.671
and you haven't been answering
the phone so I started to worry


1519
01:19:44.801 --> 01:19:47.326
but I, uh...

1520
01:19:48.457 --> 01:19:50.024
...suppose I can see why.

1521
01:19:51.330 --> 01:19:53.419
I wanted to make sure
you were alive,


1522
01:19:53.549 --> 01:19:57.162
and if you were alive,
which you are,


1523
01:19:57.292 --> 01:20:00.948
to tell you that I think
I messed things up with Harper.


1524
01:20:01.078 --> 01:20:04.125
I called her to see
if she'd heard from you


1525
01:20:04.256 --> 01:20:05.735
and I didn't know
I wasn't supposed to bring up


1526
01:20:05.866 --> 01:20:07.650
the copyright.

1527
01:20:07.781 --> 01:20:10.175
It's quite alright.
It doesn't matter anymore.


1528
01:20:11.524 --> 01:20:13.265
Zoey, this is my executive
assistant Elliott.


1529
01:20:13.395 --> 01:20:15.049
Elliott, this is Zoey.

1530
01:20:16.703 --> 01:20:18.531
Please, have a seat. Join us.

1531
01:20:20.663 --> 01:20:23.318
I thought it was the book that
was supposed to be a secret.


1532
01:20:25.059 --> 01:20:27.670
Oh, no, it was supposed to be
a secret from her, wasn't it?


1533
01:20:27.801 --> 01:20:29.368
No, no. Harper.

1534
01:20:30.934 --> 01:20:32.719
I'm having Northbound Elf
republished in hardback


1535
01:20:32.849 --> 01:20:34.024
for Harper.

1536
01:20:34.155 --> 01:20:36.201
Wait, it wasn't for Zoey?

1537
01:20:39.073 --> 01:20:40.901
Uh, no.

1538
01:20:44.992 --> 01:20:47.255
In the end, Harper deceived me,

1539
01:20:47.386 --> 01:20:50.780
but it led to you,
me and Zoey here


1540
01:20:50.911 --> 01:20:52.565
on this lovely date right now.

1541
01:20:53.479 --> 01:20:55.829
But, let's face it,

1542
01:20:55.959 --> 01:20:57.700
I'm not the person
you're supposed to be with.


1543
01:20:57.831 --> 01:21:00.355
No, no, you are.

1544
01:21:00.486 --> 01:21:02.575
You're falling in love
with her, aren't you?


1545
01:21:04.794 --> 01:21:07.449
You are falling
in love with Harper!


1546
01:21:09.016 --> 01:21:10.583
You and I meant well,
but we have terrible chemistry.


1547
01:21:10.713 --> 01:21:12.498
And Northbound Elf
did nothing for me.


1548
01:21:14.326 --> 01:21:15.849
Now all the weight's
off my chest.


1549
01:21:16.589 --> 01:21:17.590
I'm...

1550
01:21:19.418 --> 01:21:20.854
...falling in love with Harper.

1551
01:21:20.984 --> 01:21:23.291
Oh! Harper's fantastic.

1552
01:21:23.422 --> 01:21:25.293
I've been trying to get her
to open herself up to dating


1553
01:21:25.424 --> 01:21:26.860
for so long.

1554
01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:28.992
You two would be adorbs.

1555
01:21:29.123 --> 01:21:30.907
And he's actually
double in love with her,


1556
01:21:31.038 --> 01:21:33.693
first as Miss Santa #1,
and now in real life.


1557
01:21:33.823 --> 01:21:36.261
Great point, Elliott.

1558
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:40.265
So, what happens now?

1559
01:21:41.135 --> 01:21:42.136
Nothing.

1560
01:21:43.224 --> 01:21:45.270
She doesn't feel the same way.

1561
01:21:46.967 --> 01:21:48.969
She went to the end of the earth
to keep me from finding out...


1562
01:21:50.536 --> 01:21:52.973
she was the person
I was actually looking for.


1563
01:21:53.103 --> 01:21:55.584
Well, do you think she knows
how you feel about her?


1564
01:21:55.715 --> 01:21:57.499
What about the republication,
how did that go over?


1565
01:21:57.630 --> 01:21:59.545
It hasn't yet,
I haven't had ti...


1566
01:22:04.506 --> 01:22:05.420
I've gotta go.

1567
01:22:05.551 --> 01:22:07.292
Um, thank you both.

1568
01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:11.296
Elliott, you stay.

1569
01:22:12.471 --> 01:22:13.428
Yeah.

1570
01:22:13.559 --> 01:22:15.517
Dinner's on me.

1571
01:22:15.648 --> 01:22:17.998
- Uh...
- Okay you kids, gotta go.


1572
01:22:18.999 --> 01:22:20.522
Good luck! Merry Christmas!

1573
01:22:24.091 --> 01:22:26.006
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


1574
01:22:31.054 --> 01:22:32.229
Hey.

1575
01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:33.840
Hey.

1576
01:22:35.624 --> 01:22:37.147
Sylvia's wonderful, Derrick.

1577
01:22:37.278 --> 01:22:39.759
I'm partial to her myself.

1578
01:22:41.021 --> 01:22:42.762
How are things going
with Santa Claus?


1579
01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:46.679
It didn't work out.

1580
01:22:46.809 --> 01:22:49.682
And I think it's for the better.

1581
01:22:52.119 --> 01:22:56.036
So, uh, I'm to assume
that you headed it off.


1582
01:22:57.167 --> 01:22:58.734
And I guess it's safe to assume

1583
01:22:58.865 --> 01:23:01.215
that Dani's at least
part of your excuse?


1584
01:23:04.044 --> 01:23:06.438
Because the thing
about Dani is...


1585
01:23:06.568 --> 01:23:07.961
she's growing up.

1586
01:23:09.528 --> 01:23:11.704
She's getting wiser,
more perceptive.


1587
01:23:11.834 --> 01:23:13.183
Listen, at some point,

1588
01:23:13.314 --> 01:23:15.316
it will be less about
protecting her and more about


1589
01:23:15.447 --> 01:23:17.318
setting a good example.

1590
01:23:17.449 --> 01:23:19.886
Hey, remember that big fight
we got into in college?


1591
01:23:20.016 --> 01:23:22.192
And that big gesture
that I made,


1592
01:23:22.323 --> 01:23:24.499
singing to you from your window
of our biology class,


1593
01:23:24.630 --> 01:23:26.196
remember that?
- Yes.


1594
01:23:26.327 --> 01:23:28.242
Right.
Well, I've been outdone.


1595
01:23:30.026 --> 01:23:31.419
Santa Claus posted something

1596
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:33.073
that I think you might
be interested in.


1597
01:23:35.249 --> 01:23:36.598
Press play.

1598
01:23:36.729 --> 01:23:38.557
Yeah.

1599
01:23:38.687 --> 01:23:41.255
<i>I'd say it's less
of a business venture</i>


1600
01:23:41.386 --> 01:23:44.606
<i>and more of a gift to someone
very important to me.</i>


1601
01:23:46.086 --> 01:23:48.262
Because Northbound Elf
is very special to her too.


1602
01:23:49.959 --> 01:23:52.701
<i>It's a book about finding home
where you least suspect it.</i>


1603
01:23:53.398 --> 01:23:55.269
<i>And I found home with her.</i>

1604
01:23:59.491 --> 01:24:00.753
Oh...

1605
01:24:02.145 --> 01:24:04.147
I... I've gotta go.

1606
01:24:11.154 --> 01:24:12.504
Hi.

1607
01:24:12.634 --> 01:24:14.114
Hey.

1608
01:24:16.203 --> 01:24:19.293
Is this for Zoey?

1609
01:24:20.642 --> 01:24:25.125
No, actually,
it's for Miss Santa #1.


1610
01:24:26.735 --> 01:24:30.347
Thought it would remind her
of her favourite part


1611
01:24:30.478 --> 01:24:32.437
of her favourite book.

1612
01:24:36.789 --> 01:24:38.138
It is.

1613
01:24:39.487 --> 01:24:41.620
I'm sorry that
it's not fully wrapped,


1614
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:44.100
I ran out of wrapping paper
and my favourite paper store


1615
01:24:44.231 --> 01:24:45.798
was closed early today.

1616
01:24:47.408 --> 01:24:50.324
I just saw your post.

1617
01:24:50.455 --> 01:24:52.718
It was...

1618
01:24:52.848 --> 01:24:54.589
I was inspired.

1619
01:24:58.593 --> 01:25:01.814
I need you to know that
I was not after Six Degrees.


1620
01:25:01.944 --> 01:25:04.904
I wanted to secure a copyright
but I wanted to do it for you,


1621
01:25:05.034 --> 01:25:06.819
to protect your idea.

1622
01:25:06.949 --> 01:25:08.473
And...

1623
01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:13.608
I also included a prototype.

1624
01:25:13.739 --> 01:25:16.219
You can think of it as
a type of scaffolding.


1625
01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:19.658
And you can go in there,
and play around,


1626
01:25:19.788 --> 01:25:21.529
and change things if you want.

1627
01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:23.879
Or nothing at all,
it's up to you.


1628
01:25:24.010 --> 01:25:25.577
But, um...

1629
01:25:25.707 --> 01:25:29.015
I was just hoping
that we could be partners.


1630
01:25:32.845 --> 01:25:34.629
I...

1631
01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:37.937
I think you were right
about opening up Six Degrees


1632
01:25:39.025 --> 01:25:41.027
and...

1633
01:25:41.157 --> 01:25:43.029
I want to do that with you.

1634
01:25:44.596 --> 01:25:47.729
I thought I was protecting it,
but I was actually


1635
01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:50.471
holding it back
from so much potential.


1636
01:25:51.646 --> 01:25:53.779
I think the same
might go for my heart.


1637
01:25:55.389 --> 01:25:58.697
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
that I was Santa #1.


1638
01:25:58.827 --> 01:26:00.437
At first I thought you were

1639
01:26:00.568 --> 01:26:01.961
the last person
in the world for me,


1640
01:26:02.091 --> 01:26:03.440
and then that became
less and less the case


1641
01:26:03.571 --> 01:26:05.225
until...

1642
01:26:05.355 --> 01:26:07.053
you were the only one for me.

1643
01:26:26.246 --> 01:26:27.726
I think this is another
great argument


1644
01:26:27.856 --> 01:26:29.423
for opening up Six Degrees.

1645
01:26:30.946 --> 01:26:33.601
I think you might be
right about that, partner.
