1
00:01:18.817 --> 00:01:20.152
- Hey, Jim.
- Good morning.


2
00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:26.116
- Thanks.
- Thank you.


3
00:01:28.202 --> 00:01:29.722
That all you're traveling with, honey?

4
00:01:31.955 --> 00:01:32.956
I'm Sharon.

5
00:01:51.683 --> 00:01:52.726
You wear a medium?

6
00:01:55.812 --> 00:01:56.813
Okay…

7
00:01:58.607 --> 00:02:02.986
Cell phone is prepaid. Somewhere on here,
it tells you the number.


8
00:02:04.488 --> 00:02:06.490
I was trying to think
what else to get you.


9
00:02:06.573 --> 00:02:08.574
It's always different with each person.

10
00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:11.912
Eye drops, hair spray, whatever…

11
00:02:12.412 --> 00:02:15.290
Last guy, he liked to use
conditioner instead of shaving cream.


12
00:02:15.791 --> 00:02:17.459
You just let me know what you need.

13
00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:26.969
Do you need me to go slower?

14
00:02:53.203 --> 00:02:54.371
Let me help you.

15
00:02:59.543 --> 00:03:01.837
There you go. Good.

16
00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:10.262
Well, I'm sure
you're more of an adventurer.


17
00:03:11.221 --> 00:03:14.725
I can't stand planes.
Don't like being up in the air


18
00:03:14.808 --> 00:03:17.394
and all the people
breathing down your neck.


19
00:03:19.605 --> 00:03:20.606
Good job, honey.

20
00:03:25.193 --> 00:03:26.194
All right.

21
00:03:26.695 --> 00:03:31.950
Now, let's stand up slowly.

22
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.665
Bathrooms can be dangerous.

23
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.378
Here, let me help you.

24
00:04:11.365 --> 00:04:14.701
Frank liked naproxen better than Advil.

25
00:04:15.744 --> 00:04:17.746
He had bursitis in his shoulder.

26
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.083
He worked in the plant,
packing TV dinners.


27
00:04:22.167 --> 00:04:26.588
I wouldn't eat 'em. All that ammonium,
probably what got him sick.


28
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.800
How long ago was that?

29
00:04:30.384 --> 00:04:31.385
Nine years.

30
00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:36.473
I got so good at taking care of him, I
thought, why can't I do that for a living?


31
00:04:36.557 --> 00:04:38.850
So I went back
to school and got licensed.

32
00:04:39.351 --> 00:04:40.811
What a miserable life.

33
00:04:49.152 --> 00:04:50.153
I'm so sorry.

34
00:04:51.697 --> 00:04:54.616
It's okay.
People say things they don't mean.


35
00:04:55.993 --> 00:04:59.246
Sometimes they can't remember words.
It'll get easier.


36
00:05:10.966 --> 00:05:12.759
Do you remember this man's name?

37
00:05:16.263 --> 00:05:18.849
John Jones.

38
00:05:25.647 --> 00:05:26.815
Mary Black?

39
00:05:35.282 --> 00:05:36.283
I have no idea.

40
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.954
Okay. And now with the other hand?

41
00:05:48.503 --> 00:05:50.005
You got it.

42
00:05:52.299 --> 00:05:54.635
Good job. It's all right. Going back.

43
00:06:38.428 --> 00:06:39.555
Sharon!

44
00:06:42.432 --> 00:06:43.433
Sharon!

45
00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:49.481
You're okay, honey.

46
00:06:50.732 --> 00:06:55.028
It's okay. Just breathe.

47
00:06:55.696 --> 00:06:56.780
Listen to me.

48
00:06:59.741 --> 00:07:02.578
It's okay. You're okay.

49
00:07:03.203 --> 00:07:06.707
That's it. Just breathe.

50
00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:10.627
In… and out.

51
00:07:12.337 --> 00:07:15.382
In and out.

52
00:07:21.847 --> 00:07:24.892
One more.

53
00:07:27.436 --> 00:07:28.478
You're doing great.

54
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.526
Good. This is a big one.
They won't be like this later.


55
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:45.871
Are you with me?

56
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.241
Thank you.

57
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:40.217
You wanna go for a drive
before it gets dark?


58
00:08:50.644 --> 00:08:52.521
Let's take this right into town.

59
00:09:04.324 --> 00:09:05.324
Look at you.

60
00:09:09.371 --> 00:09:10.372
You're ready to go.

61
00:09:27.014 --> 00:09:32.019
Pull over. You need to pull over
just to the side of the road. Right here.


62
00:09:42.654 --> 00:09:43.780
I'm sorry.

63
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:45.365
It's okay.

64
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:48.911
I know this is hard.

65
00:09:49.912 --> 00:09:54.625
This isn't hard.
Driving a car shouldn't be a victory.


66
00:09:57.377 --> 00:10:00.797
I mean leaving. 
Transition can be hard.

67
00:10:02.007 --> 00:10:05.886
If you're not feeling ready,
we can look into extending your stay.


68
00:10:07.304 --> 00:10:08.513
I can't pay for that.

69
00:10:10.224 --> 00:10:11.934
I should be getting back anyway.

70
00:10:12.517 --> 00:10:13.727
Back home.

71
00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.397
No, back to work. Redeploy.

72
00:10:22.152 --> 00:10:26.532
You've made a lot of progress, but you're
not ready to go back to work. Not nearly.


73
00:10:28.408 --> 00:10:30.994
Then what the hell was the point
in all of this?


74
00:10:47.553 --> 00:10:49.555
Don't forget what we talked about, okay?

75
00:10:51.848 --> 00:10:54.643
Organize yourself. 
Prep for memory gaps.

76
00:10:56.186 --> 00:10:59.356
Make lists. Keep your lists.
Put like with like.


77
00:10:59.439 --> 00:11:02.609
Find two of something,
put them together like we worked on.


78
00:11:02.693 --> 00:11:03.819
I'm not gonna forget.

79
00:11:04.945 --> 00:11:08.073
People do.
They can get a little ahead of themselves.


80
00:11:09.741 --> 00:11:13.287
Well, what's your plan for getting home
from the bus? We can write it down.


81
00:11:15.539 --> 00:11:18.208
My mom is gonna pick me up
from the bus station.


82
00:11:18.792 --> 00:11:20.252
Anyone else gonna be around?

83
00:11:21.461 --> 00:11:22.462
Your brother?

84
00:11:27.134 --> 00:11:30.345
I haven't really been home in a while,
and it's not like I'm staying for long.


85
00:11:30.429 --> 00:11:33.015
- So…
- It can help to be with people.


86
00:11:34.182 --> 00:11:35.183
I'm good on my own.

87
00:11:41.315 --> 00:11:45.652
Ativan, Depakote, Cymbalta, Vicodin.

88
00:11:46.361 --> 00:11:47.487
The rehab's not over.

89
00:11:49.072 --> 00:11:52.492
You're gonna have to work hard every day
to do all the things you used to do.


90
00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.661
Yep.

91
00:11:56.997 --> 00:11:57.998
I'm gonna be fine.

92
00:16:22.179 --> 00:16:24.598
You think you're so funny, don't you?

93
00:16:24.681 --> 00:16:26.516
I think it's in here. Hold on.

94
00:16:27.226 --> 00:16:29.853
Okay. I'll be right there. Hold on.

95
00:16:31.563 --> 00:16:32.564
Lynsey?

96
00:16:35.609 --> 00:16:38.528
Lynsey, I thought you said
you were coming on Friday.


97
00:16:39.571 --> 00:16:40.572
Mom?

98
00:16:45.035 --> 00:16:46.036
You okay?

99
00:16:48.121 --> 00:16:49.122
I'm fine.

100
00:16:53.919 --> 00:16:56.213
I asked Debbie to get off work
early Friday.


101
00:16:57.297 --> 00:17:00.425
I was gonna get groceries,
clean out the truck for you,


102
00:17:01.969 --> 00:17:05.513
get a cake, pick you up.
It was gonna be a homecoming on Friday.


103
00:17:06.598 --> 00:17:07.724
It's okay.

104
00:17:10.476 --> 00:17:11.770
Hey, you wanna meet Ted?

105
00:17:11.853 --> 00:17:14.397
No. I need to sleep.

106
00:17:15.523 --> 00:17:16.733
We'll keep it down.

107
00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:20.862
I gotta go to work early,
but you sleep in.


108
00:17:26.493 --> 00:17:27.494
Hey, Lyns.

109
00:17:29.913 --> 00:17:31.123
I was worried about you.

110
00:17:36.253 --> 00:17:37.254
You look like you.

111
00:18:42.778 --> 00:18:43.779
Can I help you?

112
00:18:45.155 --> 00:18:46.907
I was wondering if you're still hiring.

113
00:18:48.242 --> 00:18:49.993
- To clean pools?
- Yeah.


114
00:18:50.786 --> 00:18:53.330
You home for the summer? 
You in college?

115
00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.750
I just got back from Afghanistan.

116
00:18:57.918 --> 00:19:01.713
Thank you for your service.
My father was in the Navy. Korean.


117
00:19:02.798 --> 00:19:04.925
But why do you wanna clean pools?

118
00:19:06.552 --> 00:19:09.972
I like the water.
I used to clean the pools over at Newman.


119
00:19:10.472 --> 00:19:13.642
I guess there's not
a lot of swimming pools in Afghanistan.


120
00:19:14.226 --> 00:19:15.602
Not where I was. No.

121
00:19:16.562 --> 00:19:18.105
- Can you drive?
- Yeah.


122
00:19:19.147 --> 00:19:20.774
Great. Start tomorrow?

123
00:19:21.358 --> 00:19:22.484
Sure.

124
00:19:48.051 --> 00:19:50.387
Hey! Get the fuck off the road!

125
00:19:57.769 --> 00:20:00.063
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

126
00:20:02.357 --> 00:20:03.358
Fuck.

127
00:20:45.901 --> 00:20:47.152
Yeah.

128
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:50.531
What's this, '85 Scottsdale?

129
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:55.077
Old, old body style right here.
Got you a nice truck.


130
00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.079
Yeah. Not anymore.

131
00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.331
How long it been doing this?

132
00:20:59.414 --> 00:21:02.334
Just now. I don't know. 
It's not mine.

133
00:21:03.126 --> 00:21:04.920
When the last time
you changed the oil in it?


134
00:21:06.713 --> 00:21:07.756
I don't know.

135
00:21:09.883 --> 00:21:11.510
All right. It's all right.

136
00:21:12.261 --> 00:21:13.929
Hey, Santiago.

137
00:21:15.556 --> 00:21:16.557
You can wait inside.

138
00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.641
We got air in there.

139
00:21:19.685 --> 00:21:20.727
Yeah.

140
00:21:21.895 --> 00:21:24.898
Yesterday, I said
it was the exhaust valve, and I was right.


141
00:21:43.083 --> 00:21:46.003
So... Well, probably just the carburetor.

142
00:21:46.086 --> 00:21:48.088
And if it is,
I can just get that part on eBay.


143
00:21:48.171 --> 00:21:51.717
It ain't that hard to find. It may
take a while to get here. You in a hurry?


144
00:21:52.342 --> 00:21:54.011
I don't know how long I'll be here.

145
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:59.516
- How much is it gonna cost?
- Maybe about 350, 400, plus labor.


146
00:22:00.225 --> 00:22:02.705
Maybe more if we get in there
and find it needs some more work.


147
00:22:02.769 --> 00:22:06.148
I don't know if I wanna fix it.
It's not even mine. It's...


148
00:22:06.231 --> 00:22:10.527
Oh, no, now that…
I mean, that's a nice truck.


149
00:22:12.487 --> 00:22:13.488
So…

150
00:22:16.533 --> 00:22:19.119
Okay, how about you just
leave it here with us?


151
00:22:19.203 --> 00:22:21.830
And when I get the part,
I'll call you for an estimate. Yeah?


152
00:22:23.332 --> 00:22:24.583
I don't know my number.

153
00:22:25.751 --> 00:22:26.960
I mean, it's just business.

154
00:22:27.711 --> 00:22:30.923
No. I really don't know my number.

155
00:22:36.178 --> 00:22:40.015
How about you... How about this?
How about you call me,


156
00:22:40.515 --> 00:22:42.267
and your number will show up. Okay?

157
00:22:43.393 --> 00:22:44.811
Can I see your phone?

158
00:22:45.312 --> 00:22:47.648
So what I'ma do
is I'ma call me, right?

159
00:22:48.774 --> 00:22:51.610
And that way, my number will show up,
all right? Simple as that.


160
00:22:52.527 --> 00:22:53.779
It's Aucoin.

161
00:22:54.404 --> 00:22:55.405
Thank you.

162
00:23:32.192 --> 00:23:35.320
Hey, '85 Scottsdale, you okay?

163
00:23:36.947 --> 00:23:37.948
I'm fine.

164
00:23:38.949 --> 00:23:41.076
I mean, it's real hot out.
You want a ride?


165
00:23:43.412 --> 00:23:44.413
Where you headed?

166
00:23:44.496 --> 00:23:46.248
Just down near Tchoup and Bordeaux.

167
00:23:48.125 --> 00:23:50.586
- Gonna get a sno-ball?
- No.


168
00:23:52.629 --> 00:23:53.797
Shit, maybe.

169
00:24:00.637 --> 00:24:02.389
Hey, you wanna play some music?

170
00:24:03.724 --> 00:24:05.142
You can pick whatever CD you like.

171
00:24:13.942 --> 00:24:15.694
My grandma used to play this record. She...

172
00:24:16.403 --> 00:24:18.322
Man, she loved her some Ernie.

173
00:24:19.907 --> 00:24:21.825
He's making a joke
out of the blues though.


174
00:24:22.409 --> 00:24:25.913
- You grew up here?
- Yeah, born and raised. You?


175
00:24:27.247 --> 00:24:28.248
Same.

176
00:24:28.832 --> 00:24:30.626
- Where you go to high school?
- Newman.


177
00:24:34.213 --> 00:24:35.672
I had a scholarship.

178
00:24:36.381 --> 00:24:37.925
I went to De La Salle.

179
00:24:39.885 --> 00:24:40.885
Aucoin, right?

180
00:24:41.803 --> 00:24:43.722
You know, most people,
they just call me James.


181
00:24:44.514 --> 00:24:46.892
I knew a Jess Aucoin
that went to De La Salle.


182
00:24:47.601 --> 00:24:49.061
That would be my sister.

183
00:24:49.144 --> 00:24:52.314
I played against her in basketball.
She was tough.


184
00:25:03.742 --> 00:25:05.011
The weirdest thing about this song

185
00:25:05.035 --> 00:25:07.454
is that he actually got buried
with his mother-in-law.


186
00:25:07.538 --> 00:25:08.830
Down on Claiborne.

187
00:25:09.498 --> 00:25:10.499
That's ironic.

188
00:25:14.086 --> 00:25:14.920
Shoot.

189
00:25:15.003 --> 00:25:17.214
I guess that's why
people don't buy CDs anymore.


190
00:25:17.297 --> 00:25:19.925
Know what? I'm old-school, so…

191
00:25:21.843 --> 00:25:22.844
Yeah.

192
00:25:28.684 --> 00:25:29.685
You know this one, right?

193
00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:34.398
- "Here Come the Girls"?
- That's it.


194
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.441
Okay, Newman.

195
00:26:05.679 --> 00:26:06.680
All right.

196
00:26:07.848 --> 00:26:10.976
First you scrub,
then you use your skimmer.


197
00:26:11.059 --> 00:26:13.270
Get all your flowers and leaves
off the surface.


198
00:26:13.353 --> 00:26:15.397
Then you get your leaf rake.
That's the heavy net.


199
00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.025
You get all your rocks, twigs, acorns.

200
00:26:18.108 --> 00:26:20.611
Stuff that'll clog your main drain
and damage your pump.


201
00:26:20.694 --> 00:26:23.822
Hey, you okay? 
Can you handle all of that?

202
00:26:23.906 --> 00:26:25.782
Yeah. Main drain…

203
00:26:25.866 --> 00:26:29.453
All right, good.
So then you're gonna empty the drains.


204
00:26:30.245 --> 00:26:32.873
And the drains are serious.

205
00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.126
You don't know what's in those drains.

206
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.380
You can tell a lot about a person
'cause of what's in their pool drains.


207
00:26:43.592 --> 00:26:46.094
You really gotta give it some more muscle.

208
00:26:49.431 --> 00:26:50.432
There you go.

209
00:26:51.308 --> 00:26:53.518
People treat their pools like shit.

210
00:26:54.603 --> 00:26:57.522
Out of chlorine.
Grabbing some from the truck.


211
00:27:06.031 --> 00:27:08.075
You think you can
handle this on your own?

212
00:27:08.659 --> 00:27:09.535
Yes, sir.

213
00:27:09.618 --> 00:27:11.870
Great. Then you can start
with Octavia Street tomorrow.


214
00:27:22.589 --> 00:27:26.426
Just come over after then. Yes, baby.

215
00:27:27.928 --> 00:27:29.388
Okay. I'll see you later.

216
00:27:32.349 --> 00:27:35.018
You're in here. 
I didn't see the truck.

217
00:27:36.103 --> 00:27:37.104
It's at the shop.

218
00:27:37.604 --> 00:27:40.065
What's wrong with it?
What's it gonna cost?


219
00:27:40.148 --> 00:27:42.442
Don't worry about it. 
I'll pay for it.

220
00:27:43.151 --> 00:27:44.361
That's not what I meant.

221
00:27:47.155 --> 00:27:48.156
How you feeling?

222
00:27:49.449 --> 00:27:51.827
Good. Okay. I'm good.

223
00:27:52.786 --> 00:27:56.164
Come sit with me awhile?
I could use a drink.


224
00:28:02.087 --> 00:28:03.255
You tired?

225
00:28:04.464 --> 00:28:05.465
Yeah.

226
00:28:07.467 --> 00:28:08.468
Right.

227
00:28:49.676 --> 00:28:51.803
Hello? Anybody home?

228
00:28:52.387 --> 00:28:53.805
I'm back here, James.

229
00:28:59.269 --> 00:29:00.729
Damn, this place is nice.

230
00:29:01.897 --> 00:29:04.524
- I ain't gonna get shot, am I?
- Not today.


231
00:29:05.025 --> 00:29:06.401
Owners are out of town.

232
00:29:09.154 --> 00:29:10.614
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.


233
00:29:13.742 --> 00:29:16.119
- Do you wanna sit down?
- Yeah.


234
00:29:26.004 --> 00:29:27.005
Do you swim?

235
00:29:32.928 --> 00:29:34.346
Not exactly, no.

236
00:29:34.972 --> 00:29:38.475
- I saw it in your walk.
- I get around okay.


237
00:29:40.018 --> 00:29:41.019
Did you serve?

238
00:29:42.354 --> 00:29:45.440
No. I take it you did?

239
00:29:46.608 --> 00:29:48.944
Something like that. 
I just got back.

240
00:29:50.279 --> 00:29:51.280
How's it going?

241
00:29:55.158 --> 00:29:56.702
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


242
00:29:59.621 --> 00:30:01.123
And look straight up.

243
00:30:07.254 --> 00:30:08.463
And now the left.

244
00:30:12.301 --> 00:30:13.302
Very good.

245
00:30:15.262 --> 00:30:22.019
So, Ativan, Cymbalta, Depakote, Vicodin
and a brain injury.


246
00:30:24.021 --> 00:30:26.440
From which you appear to be recovering
extremely well.


247
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:30.903
With brain injuries,
there are never any guarantees.


248
00:30:31.528 --> 00:30:34.448
I'm feeling pretty good.
In fact, I'd like to know


249
00:30:34.531 --> 00:30:38.660
what would happen
if I stopped taking the medication?


250
00:30:38.744 --> 00:30:43.290
You'd be a high risk of seizure, anxiety,
withdrawal and depression.


251
00:30:43.373 --> 00:30:44.374
I feel fine.

252
00:30:45.417 --> 00:30:48.629
Is it possible you feel fine
because of the Cymbalta?


253
00:30:51.381 --> 00:30:54.343
Could you explain to me
what caused the brain injury?


254
00:30:55.886 --> 00:30:57.012
Doesn't it say in there?

255
00:30:57.596 --> 00:31:00.265
It says, "Cerebral hemorrhage
acquired in Afghanistan


256
00:31:00.349 --> 00:31:02.601
from an explosion
while traveling in a vehicle."


257
00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:04.937
That's what caused it.

258
00:31:05.437 --> 00:31:08.649
But I want to hear
your account of what happened.


259
00:31:10.234 --> 00:31:14.821
I'm just asking to come off these meds.
I've never been medicated before,


260
00:31:14.905 --> 00:31:17.741
and I don't intend to be
for the rest of my life.


261
00:31:17.824 --> 00:31:19.701
Lynsey,
if you're looking for a neurologist


262
00:31:19.785 --> 00:31:23.330
who will give and take prescriptions
like candies, I'm not the guy.


263
00:31:30.879 --> 00:31:32.923
I work for the Army Corps of Engineers.

264
00:31:33.006 --> 00:31:36.677
I specialize in water systems.
I'd been deployed to work on a dam.


265
00:31:37.511 --> 00:31:41.932
Dam is a 20-minute drive from base.
Three-vehicle convoy.


266
00:31:43.267 --> 00:31:46.019
Ten minutes from base,
the lead vehicle explodes.


267
00:31:46.895 --> 00:31:51.316
I see it from the front window.
And then my vehicle explodes.


268
00:31:53.277 --> 00:31:55.988
At first I don't really know
what happened,


269
00:31:57.531 --> 00:32:01.785
but the guy next to me,
a sergeant, is on fire.


270
00:32:03.036 --> 00:32:07.457
Flames up his legs and on his chest,
and he's beating them.


271
00:32:15.173 --> 00:32:16.842
I can't see. I can't breathe.

272
00:32:19.177 --> 00:32:23.557
Eventually,
someone gets the rear door open,


273
00:32:25.267 --> 00:32:26.894
and some guys start getting out.

274
00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:31.523
I see the sunlight,
so I try to move towards it.


275
00:32:32.774 --> 00:32:36.904
But there's gunshots everywhere, and the
guys who are getting out are getting shot.


276
00:32:38.155 --> 00:32:43.327
They're just getting out, falling over.
So I can't get out.


277
00:32:45.454 --> 00:32:50.709
But I need to get out
because the guy next to me is on fire.


278
00:32:54.588 --> 00:32:57.716
Then I black out,
and I wake up in the hospital.


279
00:32:57.799 --> 00:33:02.221
And they told me that the detonation
caused my brain to start bleeding.


280
00:33:05.807 --> 00:33:08.894
Does that help your diagnosis?

281
00:33:09.561 --> 00:33:12.439
It does. Thank you for your candor.

282
00:33:17.611 --> 00:33:19.196
Tell me, how are you sleeping?

283
00:33:23.825 --> 00:33:24.826
Not great.

284
00:33:37.047 --> 00:33:38.048
Hi.

285
00:33:39.925 --> 00:33:40.926
Hi.

286
00:33:46.765 --> 00:33:47.975
You got food.

287
00:33:54.231 --> 00:33:56.358
Do you know how many times
I've refinanced this place?


288
00:33:56.441 --> 00:33:57.442
Three.

289
00:34:01.655 --> 00:34:06.451
I talked to Debbie.
They need someone in the office upstairs.


290
00:34:07.703 --> 00:34:10.664
We could take breaks together.
That might be nice.


291
00:34:12.416 --> 00:34:14.709
I have a job.
I'm... I got a job.

292
00:34:15.294 --> 00:34:16.378
You did? Doing what?

293
00:34:16.461 --> 00:34:17.838
Cleaning pools.

294
00:34:20.256 --> 00:34:21.341
What are you doing?

295
00:34:22.217 --> 00:34:25.178
Pools. I'm cleaning them.

296
00:34:25.262 --> 00:34:28.098
You'd rather work in 109-degree heat

297
00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:31.017
than in an air-conditioned office
in a department store?


298
00:34:31.101 --> 00:34:32.461
I told Debbie you'd meet with her.

299
00:34:32.519 --> 00:34:35.063
I told her all about you.
How smart you are. How beautiful.


300
00:34:36.439 --> 00:34:38.483
I can't work in an office right now.

301
00:34:38.566 --> 00:34:41.986
Of course you can.
It's a good job. Has insurance.


302
00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:47.659
I can't stare at a screen all day.

303
00:34:47.743 --> 00:34:49.912
Just try it.
I know it's not your dream job,


304
00:34:49.995 --> 00:34:51.914
but you don't wanna clean pools
forever either.


305
00:34:51.997 --> 00:34:54.082
It's just temporary until I can go back.

306
00:34:54.958 --> 00:34:56.334
What do you mean "back"?

307
00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:02.841
Are you kidding me?

308
00:35:04.676 --> 00:35:08.180
When were you gonna tell me that?
Wait, will they even take you back?


309
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:12.059
- I'm gonna try.
- In the shape you're in?


310
00:35:14.353 --> 00:35:15.479
It's not your problem.

311
00:35:15.562 --> 00:35:18.148
It is my problem when I get a call
in the middle of the night


312
00:35:18.232 --> 00:35:21.568
from some doctor in Germany
telling me my kid got blown up.


313
00:35:21.652 --> 00:35:23.570
I'm fine. I'll be fine.

314
00:35:24.071 --> 00:35:25.197
Okay, Lynsey.

315
00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:31.119
You're here for a visit, so visit.
How are you?


316
00:35:34.414 --> 00:35:35.791
I'm not feeling very well.

317
00:35:59.147 --> 00:36:00.732
I told you that in confidence.

318
00:36:46.236 --> 00:36:48.238
- Careful of that corner.
- Thanks.


319
00:36:49.448 --> 00:36:50.449
All right.

320
00:36:52.743 --> 00:36:53.744
Now this way.

321
00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:05.380
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.


322
00:37:07.758 --> 00:37:09.426
Hey, how much you pay for this thing?

323
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.011
Fifty bucks.

324
00:37:12.512 --> 00:37:15.515
It's brutal, but I have to pass a test
to get back to work.


325
00:37:15.599 --> 00:37:17.434
You got to pass
a test to clean pools?

326
00:37:18.018 --> 00:37:19.853
No. My old job.

327
00:37:22.773 --> 00:37:23.774
You ever use one?

328
00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:28.528
Went to PT a couple times.
I ain't been to the gym in a while though.


329
00:37:28.612 --> 00:37:29.613
Me either.

330
00:37:31.532 --> 00:37:33.700
- Hey, what's going on with my truck?
- What truck?


331
00:37:35.786 --> 00:37:37.788
Nah, things just get busy.

332
00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:40.958
I got this white lady. 
She keep calling me

333
00:37:41.041 --> 00:37:43.802
to help her move gym equipment
all the time. You know what I'm saying?


334
00:37:44.336 --> 00:37:45.587
Weird.

335
00:37:45.671 --> 00:37:48.298
What about you?
How the pool business going?


336
00:37:49.591 --> 00:37:50.592
It's cutthroat.

337
00:37:51.927 --> 00:37:54.346
- Really?
- No.


338
00:37:56.265 --> 00:37:57.266
Funny.

339
00:37:59.434 --> 00:38:03.063
- Just putting it right here, right?
- Yeah. That's fine.


340
00:38:03.146 --> 00:38:04.147
All right.

341
00:38:05.023 --> 00:38:07.651
Okay. Don't get all Navy SEAL
and overdo it, all right? It's hot.


342
00:38:08.902 --> 00:38:11.029
- I can handle the heat.
- All right.


343
00:38:11.822 --> 00:38:13.240
- Thank you.
- Anytime.


344
00:38:17.786 --> 00:38:19.037
Yeah. All right.

345
00:38:21.164 --> 00:38:24.126
Hey, you wanna get a burger or something?

346
00:38:24.209 --> 00:38:28.171
Absolutely. I was gonna say the same
thing. I just didn't wanna suggest that.


347
00:38:28.255 --> 00:38:31.049
I didn't want to be weird or anything.
So, your treat, right?


348
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:33.302
- I wasn't thinking that…
- All right.


349
00:38:33.385 --> 00:38:34.511
I mean, I did just move…

350
00:38:35.012 --> 00:38:36.388
A rowing machine for you.

351
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:41.435
Hey, you tell him I said hey?

352
00:38:42.477 --> 00:38:44.688
Yeah. You know I will.

353
00:38:45.981 --> 00:38:47.149
That's on me, James.

354
00:38:47.232 --> 00:38:49.085
What you talking about, sugar?
It's always on you.


355
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:50.110
Not always.

356
00:38:53.238 --> 00:38:56.116
- Thanks.
- Yeah. She went to school with my mama.


357
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:03.248
- So you really don't drink at all?
- Huh?


358
00:39:03.957 --> 00:39:05.500
You really don't drink at all?

359
00:39:06.376 --> 00:39:07.377
I haven't tried.

360
00:39:08.003 --> 00:39:09.254
You ain't never tried a beer?

361
00:39:09.338 --> 00:39:13.050
No. Not since I've been back.
I'm kind of on a lot of medication.


362
00:39:15.844 --> 00:39:16.929
What kind of medication?

363
00:39:18.305 --> 00:39:20.891
Like, "don't-shoot-yourself-in-the-head"
kind of medication.


364
00:39:21.767 --> 00:39:22.768
Okay.

365
00:39:24.144 --> 00:39:27.856
You mean like pain pills?
Crazy pills? Happy pills?


366
00:39:28.482 --> 00:39:30.317
So far, just pain and crazy.

367
00:39:31.235 --> 00:39:33.028
- Hey, can I buy you a beer?
- What?


368
00:39:33.111 --> 00:39:35.614
You are really beautiful.
Can I buy you a beer?


369
00:39:36.114 --> 00:39:38.408
- I'm okay. Thank you.
- Come on. Have a beer with me.


370
00:39:38.492 --> 00:39:40.678
You're in a bar drinking root beer.
We're in New Orleans.


371
00:39:40.702 --> 00:39:42.120
I think she said no, bro.

372
00:39:43.789 --> 00:39:45.499
Hey, I'll buy you a beer too, bro.

373
00:39:45.582 --> 00:39:47.292
Deaf and blind.

374
00:39:47.376 --> 00:39:49.711
No, because I already got a beer.

375
00:39:50.212 --> 00:39:53.507
And, you know, my girl said no.

376
00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:56.635
I'm not picking up that vibe.
Are you his girl?


377
00:39:57.261 --> 00:39:58.971
I'm really sorry. 
I have a boyfriend.

378
00:39:59.471 --> 00:40:02.099
Wait. So she's your girl,
and she has a boyfriend?


379
00:40:02.182 --> 00:40:06.311
Yeah, that's exactly right. She my girl,
and she got a boyfriend.


380
00:40:07.104 --> 00:40:08.855
That okay with you, bro?

381
00:40:10.357 --> 00:40:13.151
- Don't shoot me for trying.
- Hey, you have a good night.


382
00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:15.571
Stupid.

383
00:40:16.446 --> 00:40:19.157
Look, I know you're not my girl.

384
00:40:19.241 --> 00:40:21.493
- Do you know what I mean? I mean, I...
- It's fine.


385
00:40:22.202 --> 00:40:23.704
All right.

386
00:40:26.456 --> 00:40:27.916
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

387
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.585
I don't have a boyfriend.

388
00:40:31.378 --> 00:40:32.462
Are you with anybody?

389
00:40:34.381 --> 00:40:35.382
Nah.

390
00:40:37.134 --> 00:40:39.553
I was engaged. Once.

391
00:40:40.846 --> 00:40:42.264
What happened?

392
00:40:44.558 --> 00:40:45.559
Lost my leg.

393
00:40:54.526 --> 00:40:56.111
Can I try a sip of your beer?

394
00:40:58.822 --> 00:41:00.782
- You sure?
- Yeah.


395
00:41:16.757 --> 00:41:18.800
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Last one.


396
00:41:32.648 --> 00:41:33.732
I wanted to say

397
00:41:33.815 --> 00:41:36.485
that thing
about me not having a boyfriend...


398
00:41:36.568 --> 00:41:39.613
- Hey. Look. Nah, I just...
- No. Well, let me just.


399
00:41:42.366 --> 00:41:45.369
I don't have boyfriends.
I have girlfriends.


400
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:51.166
I mean, not right now,
but when I do, that's what I have.


401
00:41:52.626 --> 00:41:55.587
- Okay. I wasn't...
- No, I know what you were doing,


402
00:41:55.671 --> 00:41:57.047
and I really appreciate it.

403
00:41:57.548 --> 00:42:02.553
I'm just telling you that
because now you know that about me.


404
00:42:06.431 --> 00:42:12.062
Okay. Well… Okay. It's cool.

405
00:42:15.524 --> 00:42:19.027
- Thank you?
- You're welcome.


406
00:42:20.404 --> 00:42:22.990
It's all good.

407
00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:36.086
You know, I've never actually tried weed.

408
00:42:37.004 --> 00:42:38.005
Are you serious?

409
00:42:38.839 --> 00:42:41.008
I mean, my brother did enough drugs
for the both of us.


410
00:42:41.508 --> 00:42:42.509
Yeah?

411
00:42:44.553 --> 00:42:47.681
Crack, meth, household detergent.

412
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:53.228
Some alchemy he read online.
Didn't work. Burned his lung.


413
00:42:53.979 --> 00:42:54.980
Damn.

414
00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:02.654
- What happened to your leg?
- Sheesh.


415
00:43:02.738 --> 00:43:06.241
- I really didn't see that coming.
- Well, what happened to it?


416
00:43:12.247 --> 00:43:13.624
I was in a car accident.

417
00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:20.589
I got in a car accident with Jess…

418
00:43:22.591 --> 00:43:26.428
And her son, my nephew, Antoine.

419
00:43:27.387 --> 00:43:28.472
On the Causeway.

420
00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:35.604
I remember… looking in my rearview mirror,

421
00:43:36.104 --> 00:43:38.523
and I could see Jess's face.

422
00:43:40.859 --> 00:43:43.111
I just remember looking in her eyes.

423
00:43:45.822 --> 00:43:47.533
It was like she was saying bye.

424
00:43:48.492 --> 00:43:49.493
Like,

425
00:43:51.203 --> 00:43:52.371
"See you later."

426
00:43:55.123 --> 00:43:57.501
And then, I kind of wake up.

427
00:43:57.584 --> 00:43:59.836
And I just feel this pressing into me,

428
00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.048
like this really hard, hard pressing.
Really hard.


429
00:44:03.131 --> 00:44:06.552
And it turns out
the car was bent out of shape.


430
00:44:07.928 --> 00:44:08.929
And I'm bent with it.

431
00:44:10.556 --> 00:44:11.557
And this leg…

432
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:18.564
This leg is so fucked up
that I could look down


433
00:44:18.647 --> 00:44:21.275
and the sole of my shoe
is looking right back at me.


434
00:44:21.358 --> 00:44:25.279
And then there's these people
screaming outside the car.


435
00:44:29.032 --> 00:44:30.033
Not inside.

436
00:44:32.953 --> 00:44:33.954
Did Jess die?

437
00:44:37.332 --> 00:44:38.333
Nah.

438
00:44:41.378 --> 00:44:42.629
Nah, not Jess.

439
00:44:45.674 --> 00:44:46.925
I'm so sorry.

440
00:44:52.139 --> 00:44:53.140
Yep.

441
00:45:30.719 --> 00:45:32.304
Hey, you good?

442
00:45:40.437 --> 00:45:44.149
Hey, look, if it get dark,
now, you just ride it. Okay?


443
00:45:44.983 --> 00:45:45.984
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


444
00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:49.655
How do I do that?

445
00:45:51.406 --> 00:45:55.410
That's... All right. What's dark?

446
00:45:56.495 --> 00:45:57.496
Being back here.

447
00:45:58.747 --> 00:46:00.582
So you don't got love for this city?

448
00:46:00.666 --> 00:46:02.251
It's not the city.

449
00:46:02.334 --> 00:46:03.544
Then what is it?

450
00:46:06.213 --> 00:46:07.214
It's that house.

451
00:46:08.507 --> 00:46:11.051
So many nights
sitting at that kitchen table,


452
00:46:11.134 --> 00:46:12.844
and my brother would be nodding off.

453
00:46:12.928 --> 00:46:18.475
And my mom would say,
"Poor thing. He's so tired."


454
00:46:20.018 --> 00:46:21.019
I miss him.

455
00:46:24.231 --> 00:46:26.650
He and I were
both trapped in that house.

456
00:46:28.819 --> 00:46:30.571
But I'm the only
one that made it out.

457
00:46:35.117 --> 00:46:37.828
Anyway. And then I just
never thought I would come back here.


458
00:46:39.204 --> 00:46:40.664
But then I got blown up.

459
00:46:40.747 --> 00:46:42.749
You got... What? 
You got blown up?

460
00:46:43.625 --> 00:46:44.626
IED.

461
00:47:51.235 --> 00:47:52.236
Oh, shit!

462
00:47:53.654 --> 00:47:54.655
Thank you.

463
00:48:06.291 --> 00:48:07.292
Okay. Well…

464
00:48:10.671 --> 00:48:11.672
What's the rush?

465
00:48:19.513 --> 00:48:20.556
You in a rush?

466
00:48:21.306 --> 00:48:22.307
No.

467
00:48:23.559 --> 00:48:24.560
Me neither.

468
00:48:25.561 --> 00:48:26.562
Thanks.

469
00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:56.258
It's a nice house.

470
00:48:57.676 --> 00:48:58.677
Big.

471
00:48:59.177 --> 00:49:02.431
Yeah. It's too big for me. You think?

472
00:49:04.308 --> 00:49:06.101
I got nothing against big houses.

473
00:49:08.687 --> 00:49:10.731
Yeah. It was the family home.

474
00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:12.482
You grew up here?

475
00:49:12.566 --> 00:49:14.067
No.

476
00:49:14.902 --> 00:49:18.238
Me and Jess bought
it… after my mama died.

477
00:49:19.907 --> 00:49:22.409
Just… living here together.

478
00:49:23.785 --> 00:49:29.291
Three years of me, her, Antoine.

479
00:49:32.586 --> 00:49:33.587
It was…

480
00:49:48.143 --> 00:49:49.144
Good.

481
00:49:54.274 --> 00:49:55.442
You stayed?

482
00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:58.111
Jess moved out, and I...

483
00:50:00.531 --> 00:50:02.366
Yeah, I did. I stayed.

484
00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:11.667
My mom stayed in
the house we all shared.

485
00:50:13.126 --> 00:50:14.545
She's the only one left.

486
00:50:14.628 --> 00:50:16.505
I don't know what you're talking about.

487
00:50:19.883 --> 00:50:22.511
I don't think it's healthy. Staying.

488
00:50:23.845 --> 00:50:26.974
For her? Or for me?

489
00:50:31.061 --> 00:50:32.062
Actually, me.

490
00:50:42.072 --> 00:50:46.451
You know
you don't have to live with your mother.


491
00:50:50.163 --> 00:50:51.415
Could move in here.

492
00:50:52.165 --> 00:50:53.166
What?

493
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:54.960
Yeah, move in.

494
00:50:55.794 --> 00:50:57.170
You got your own room.

495
00:50:57.671 --> 00:51:00.799
You know how many rooms I got?
I wouldn't even know you was here.


496
00:51:04.761 --> 00:51:05.762
I don't think that's

497
00:51:05.846 --> 00:51:08.849
I'm not hitting on you
or nothing. I'm just.


498
00:51:09.975 --> 00:51:12.895
I know. But you're drunk.

499
00:51:13.937 --> 00:51:14.938
That's true.

500
00:51:20.527 --> 00:51:23.030
It would just be nice
to have someone around.


501
00:51:26.366 --> 00:51:29.077
Have coffee together in the morning.

502
00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.496
You know, smoke in the evening.

503
00:51:33.874 --> 00:51:35.250
Cook together sometimes.

504
00:51:39.713 --> 00:51:41.048
It's what we used to do.

505
00:51:54.895 --> 00:51:55.896
Hey.

506
00:51:57.648 --> 00:51:58.815
It's whatever.

507
00:52:04.655 --> 00:52:05.656
Thank you for the ride.

508
00:52:06.281 --> 00:52:07.282
Sure.

509
00:52:42.276 --> 00:52:43.569
Please don't judge me.

510
00:52:44.194 --> 00:52:45.487
I'm not judging you.

511
00:52:48.574 --> 00:52:49.575
Where you been?

512
00:52:50.075 --> 00:52:51.076
Out with a friend.

513
00:52:51.702 --> 00:52:52.911
Have you been drinking?

514
00:52:54.288 --> 00:52:55.664
A little, maybe.

515
00:52:56.290 --> 00:52:57.291
Lynsey.

516
00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:00.085
I thought you were the responsible one.

517
00:53:00.168 --> 00:53:01.962
I am the responsible one.

518
00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:04.548
Just don't turn into your aunt Leslie.

519
00:53:05.048 --> 00:53:07.676
Or anyone from my family.

520
00:53:08.635 --> 00:53:10.053
Or your father's side.

521
00:53:11.388 --> 00:53:12.389
Okay, Mom.

522
00:53:13.056 --> 00:53:14.308
You hungry?

523
00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:16.143
I just had a burger.

524
00:53:16.226 --> 00:53:17.394
"I just had a burger."

525
00:53:20.856 --> 00:53:25.485
You used to be the funniest little kid,
then you became so serious.


526
00:53:32.034 --> 00:53:33.285
You're probably tired.

527
00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:38.081
You got work tomorrow?

528
00:53:41.877 --> 00:53:42.920
This is luxury.

529
00:53:55.432 --> 00:53:56.808
So, what are your doctors saying?

530
00:53:57.309 --> 00:53:59.102
My next appointment's on the 22nd.

531
00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:02.648
I'll drive you.

532
00:54:03.482 --> 00:54:04.858
You don't have to do that.

533
00:54:04.942 --> 00:54:08.195
No, I wanna. They treat you better
if you have someone with you.


534
00:54:08.278 --> 00:54:11.365
They know somebody cares about you,
so you must not be too awful.


535
00:54:12.783 --> 00:54:16.119
- You sure?
- Yes! Is it that unbelievable?


536
00:54:16.203 --> 00:54:17.204
Sorry.

537
00:54:18.539 --> 00:54:19.540
Thank you.

538
00:54:20.582 --> 00:54:23.418
Aren't your tits sweating?
Get your ass in this pool.


539
00:54:24.586 --> 00:54:26.755
It's good for you. 
It'll relax you.

540
00:54:33.887 --> 00:54:35.472
Geez, don't get in all at once.

541
00:55:09.381 --> 00:55:10.382
What?

542
00:55:12.217 --> 00:55:13.886
Why did you go so far away?

543
00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:18.265
I don't know. I wanted to.

544
00:55:19.474 --> 00:55:22.519
But why? Why'd you wanna?

545
00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:26.398
A lot of reasons.

546
00:55:29.526 --> 00:55:30.694
Any you want to share?

547
00:55:32.863 --> 00:55:33.864
No.

548
00:55:39.578 --> 00:55:41.079
You just couldn't stand it here?

549
00:55:46.418 --> 00:55:47.669
You can tell me the truth.

550
00:55:51.215 --> 00:55:52.216
No, I couldn't.

551
00:56:00.766 --> 00:56:03.101
When I was your age,
I couldn't stay in one place either.


552
00:56:05.395 --> 00:56:06.396
I get you.

553
00:56:11.276 --> 00:56:12.277
I really do.

554
00:56:33.006 --> 00:56:34.591
Time for a refill.

555
00:56:54.736 --> 00:56:57.072
Hello? Hello, Ted.

556
00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.409
Well, that's my voice.
That's what it sounds like.


557
00:57:02.578 --> 00:57:07.124
No. I'm busy.
I'm having a night with my daughter.


558
00:57:07.624 --> 00:57:08.625
How was your night?

559
00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:13.297
Don't be cute.

560
00:57:16.383 --> 00:57:18.886
Well, you're an idiot
'cause I don't want to see you.


561
00:57:22.556 --> 00:57:23.557
Really?

562
00:57:25.642 --> 00:57:27.603
Hold on a minute.
Let me move to the bedroom.


563
00:57:29.104 --> 00:57:30.606
No, I'm not doing anything.

564
00:59:47.242 --> 00:59:50.621
Hey. Thank you. I'm so sorry.

565
00:59:50.704 --> 00:59:52.122
Don't be sorry. It's cool.

566
00:59:53.248 --> 00:59:55.250
Stupid to think I could depend on her.

567
00:59:55.334 --> 00:59:57.002
She let you down a lot?

568
00:59:57.085 --> 01:00:00.130
Yeah. Somehow it still surprises me.

569
01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:05.302
It's all good. 
Come on, we got time.

570
01:00:05.886 --> 01:00:08.823
Probably even got time to get you
that sno-ball you ain't get the other day.


571
01:00:08.847 --> 01:00:10.015
You think?

572
01:00:10.098 --> 01:00:11.350
It's on me.

573
01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:22.861
Good.

574
01:00:25.572 --> 01:00:26.573
Thank you.

575
01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:27.741
You're welcome.

576
01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:30.619
- Is that vanilla?
- Oh, yeah.


577
01:00:31.954 --> 01:00:33.455
What? Something wrong with vanilla?

578
01:00:33.539 --> 01:00:36.875
I just didn't even know they made vanilla.

579
01:00:36.959 --> 01:00:38.877
Well, you got a
whole rainbow in your cup.

580
01:00:38.961 --> 01:00:40.462
Yeah, that's the point.

581
01:00:43.215 --> 01:00:44.901
Hey, it's all right.
I'll get you another one.


582
01:00:44.925 --> 01:00:46.402
- No, I don't want...
- I got enough...


583
01:00:46.426 --> 01:00:49.846
No, I don't want another sno-ball.
I wanna not fucking drop shit.


584
01:00:53.642 --> 01:00:54.643
Sorry.

585
01:00:56.144 --> 01:00:57.938
So, you drop shit. 
What's that about?

586
01:00:58.021 --> 01:01:00.899
I still have a few glitches
from the accident.


587
01:01:02.276 --> 01:01:04.111
So that's what the doctor for?
Fixing that?


588
01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:06.154
No. I mean, I'm fixed.

589
01:01:15.873 --> 01:01:17.082
Okay.

590
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:26.550
Say it.

591
01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:29.219
It's good.

592
01:01:31.179 --> 01:01:33.307
So, this doctor you going to,
you just going for fun?


593
01:01:35.309 --> 01:01:37.561
No, I need him to clear me,
so I can go back.


594
01:01:39.146 --> 01:01:41.356
You got blown up over there,
and you wanna go back?


595
01:01:42.566 --> 01:01:44.109
I just have to get out of here.

596
01:01:47.279 --> 01:01:49.823
And all I need is this guy
to sign a piece of paper.


597
01:02:03.462 --> 01:02:05.005
We'll get you another sno-ball.

598
01:02:05.547 --> 01:02:08.050
I see you eyeing mine
and I ain't sharing it no more.


599
01:02:09.593 --> 01:02:12.262
Look, I got enough cash
to cover you for two more.


600
01:02:12.346 --> 01:02:14.264
After that, you on your own.

601
01:02:17.643 --> 01:02:19.686
How y'all doing? Aight. That good.

602
01:02:20.395 --> 01:02:21.813
- Headache?
- No.


603
01:02:22.481 --> 01:02:23.982
- Sleeping?
- Great.


604
01:02:24.983 --> 01:02:26.360
Mood?

605
01:02:27.694 --> 01:02:31.031
Fine. Yeah. I'm good.

606
01:02:36.078 --> 01:02:39.331
I was actually thinking,
it's time for me to go back.


607
01:02:40.582 --> 01:02:41.708
To the military?

608
01:02:42.209 --> 01:02:43.710
Redeploy. Yes.

609
01:02:44.962 --> 01:02:47.506
You honestly feel
you have a clean bill of health?


610
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:50.801
Yes. I have my post-deployment screening,

611
01:02:51.343 --> 01:02:55.722
my hearing test, my vision test,
my scans from Nebraska.


612
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:57.391
What's left?

613
01:02:57.474 --> 01:03:01.061
Possible risk of reinjury,
compounding the TBI,


614
01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:03.272
and, above all, your mental health.

615
01:03:03.355 --> 01:03:08.277
Well, that's my risk to take,
and I told you, I feel fine.


616
01:03:09.695 --> 01:03:12.155
Lynsey, smoking is linked to lung cancer.

617
01:03:12.239 --> 01:03:15.242
Extreme trauma is linked to PTSD
and depression.


618
01:03:15.325 --> 01:03:16.994
In fact, the link is stronger.

619
01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:19.788
I'm not ready to sign a waiver.

620
01:03:20.414 --> 01:03:22.499
I'm the one that has to be ready.

621
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:25.168
It's both of us.

622
01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.143
I really appreciate today.

623
01:03:42.644 --> 01:03:43.645
Sure.

624
01:03:45.814 --> 01:03:48.334
I'm not working tomorrow.
Do you wanna come by in the afternoon?


625
01:03:50.569 --> 01:03:51.653
Tomorrow afternoon?

626
01:03:52.154 --> 01:03:53.155
You working?

627
01:03:54.072 --> 01:03:55.991
I make the schedule, so…

628
01:03:57.284 --> 01:04:01.205
Well, we could go to that pool on Octavia.
The owners are still out of town.


629
01:04:01.288 --> 01:04:06.210
Well, I'm not much of a swimmer, so…

630
01:04:07.628 --> 01:04:09.046
We could just get high.

631
01:04:10.923 --> 01:04:11.924
Yeah, that could work.

632
01:04:14.593 --> 01:04:15.761
It's on me.

633
01:04:15.844 --> 01:04:17.012
Okay.

634
01:05:06.395 --> 01:05:07.396
Okay.

635
01:05:10.107 --> 01:05:11.483
We're gonna get in this pool now.

636
01:05:12.943 --> 01:05:15.821
Nah. I'm still cool.

637
01:05:17.239 --> 01:05:19.032
Come on. We gotta go swimming.

638
01:05:21.118 --> 01:05:22.536
Owners are back next week.

639
01:05:40.429 --> 01:05:41.805
Feels so good.

640
01:05:43.557 --> 01:05:44.558
Come on.

641
01:05:49.521 --> 01:05:50.689
Yes.

642
01:06:51.542 --> 01:06:53.168
I can't believe you actually got in.

643
01:06:53.252 --> 01:06:54.253
Yeah.

644
01:07:10.102 --> 01:07:12.688
Damn. How long was that?

645
01:07:13.313 --> 01:07:15.274
I used to practice holding my breath
as a kid.


646
01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:18.210
What's the longest you've ever held it?

647
01:07:19.194 --> 01:07:20.237
Twenty-six years.

648
01:07:21.113 --> 01:07:22.823
I got you beat by four years.

649
01:07:25.617 --> 01:07:27.744
- Challenge me to a race?
- You sure about that?


650
01:07:27.828 --> 01:07:28.912
You count it off.

651
01:07:28.996 --> 01:07:31.248
- Three, two, one.
- Two, one.


652
01:07:31.331 --> 01:07:32.374
What the fuck?

653
01:07:37.588 --> 01:07:38.589
Oh, shit.

654
01:07:39.464 --> 01:07:40.465
Michael Phelps!

655
01:07:42.092 --> 01:07:43.510
You didn't even try.

656
01:07:43.594 --> 01:07:45.888
Well, it ain't like I got
a propeller on this thing?


657
01:08:06.992 --> 01:08:08.702
I feel like I lied to you.

658
01:08:10.704 --> 01:08:11.705
When?

659
01:08:13.624 --> 01:08:15.292
When I told you about the accident.

660
01:08:17.753 --> 01:08:20.297
- Lied how?
- Well, not lied.


661
01:08:22.215 --> 01:08:23.550
I left something out.

662
01:08:25.384 --> 01:08:28.679
I wasn't really clear,
and it's the same thing.


663
01:08:30.014 --> 01:08:32.017
'Cause you didn't say
that you were driving?


664
01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:35.771
Yeah.

665
01:08:38.273 --> 01:08:40.817
You said you saw Jess
in the rearview mirror,


666
01:08:40.901 --> 01:08:42.611
so I kind of figured.

667
01:08:50.701 --> 01:08:51.745
Antoine...

668
01:08:54.706 --> 01:08:56.208
He was sitting next to me.

669
01:08:58.418 --> 01:09:00.128
He was in the passenger seat.

670
01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:04.967
Kept saying he wanted to sit next to me
in the front seat, so…


671
01:09:07.678 --> 01:09:09.179
And Jess said no,

672
01:09:10.931 --> 01:09:14.726
that he was too small and that he
needed to be in the child seat.


673
01:09:18.146 --> 01:09:19.481
And I said yes.

674
01:09:23.442 --> 01:09:24.695
I said yes.

675
01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:32.201
I thought I was supposed to say yes
to shit like that.


676
01:09:36.665 --> 01:09:38.125
Give him what he asks for.

677
01:09:42.129 --> 01:09:43.130
Spoil him.

678
01:09:43.839 --> 01:09:45.965
- You see...
- I do.


679
01:09:46.049 --> 01:09:49.636
- No, I...
- No, you don't need to say anything.


680
01:10:27.925 --> 01:10:29.445
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that.

681
01:10:32.179 --> 01:10:33.513
Why'd you do it then?

682
01:10:36.308 --> 01:10:38.018
I just felt so bad for you.

683
01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:49.613
No. James, come back.

684
01:11:00.415 --> 01:11:03.418
James. Don't go.

685
01:11:07.047 --> 01:11:08.173
You felt bad for me?

686
01:11:08.882 --> 01:11:12.636
- I'm sorry. I didn't...
- I got enough people feeling bad for me.


687
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:17.641
That's not how I meant it.

688
01:11:17.724 --> 01:11:18.976
Then what'd you mean?

689
01:11:20.852 --> 01:11:23.814
Yeah, you don't know. What is this?

690
01:11:25.232 --> 01:11:26.483
What is what?

691
01:11:26.567 --> 01:11:28.735
What are we doing here? Huh?

692
01:11:31.989 --> 01:11:37.244
I pick you up, I drop you off,
and I buy you sno-balls, huh?


693
01:11:37.744 --> 01:11:41.039
Tell you something,
you want a driver, call a fucking taxi.


694
01:11:41.123 --> 01:11:42.207
What you want from me?

695
01:11:42.875 --> 01:11:45.144
So I don't want to fuck you,
now you don't want to be friends?


696
01:11:45.168 --> 01:11:46.420
Okay, I want to fuck you.

697
01:11:46.503 --> 01:11:48.183
I want to fuck you,
but you just kissed me.


698
01:11:48.213 --> 01:11:50.900
You really need to figure your shit out.
I don't even understand you.


699
01:11:50.924 --> 01:11:53.924
Actually, I don't know shit about you,
but I tell you what I do know. Facts.


700
01:11:53.969 --> 01:11:56.889
You blew up in Afghanistan
or Iraq or wherever the fuck it was.


701
01:11:56.972 --> 01:11:59.349
You played basketball
with my sister. Yeah.


702
01:11:59.433 --> 01:12:02.519
- And you got a dead brother…
- I don't have a dead brother.


703
01:12:03.103 --> 01:12:04.021
What'd you say?

704
01:12:04.104 --> 01:12:05.814
When did I say
I have a dead brother?

705
01:12:06.398 --> 01:12:11.153
He was. You miss him. You had.
Past tense. He always past tense.


706
01:12:11.236 --> 01:12:12.863
- He's in prison.
- What?


707
01:12:12.946 --> 01:12:14.865
He's a junkie and a dealer.

708
01:12:15.490 --> 01:12:17.826
- You made me think he was dead.
- No.


709
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:21.038
Yeah, you did. 'Cause you only
talk about him like he dead.


710
01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:25.209
Maybe that's how it feels.
Why does it fucking matter to you?


711
01:12:25.292 --> 01:12:26.501
That is bullshit.

712
01:12:27.085 --> 01:12:30.214
You want people to think he gone so
they don't know you left his ass for dead.


713
01:12:30.297 --> 01:12:32.090
You don't know shit
about it or about me.

714
01:12:32.174 --> 01:12:33.008
Okay.

715
01:12:33.091 --> 01:12:35.653
Did you just assume we were the same,
broken people wallowing in it?


716
01:12:35.677 --> 01:12:37.137
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.


717
01:12:38.764 --> 01:12:40.891
You think I lied about my brother?
What about you?


718
01:12:41.391 --> 01:12:44.671
You let your nephew ride in the front seat
that night. What else did you leave out?


719
01:12:46.271 --> 01:12:47.272
Were you drinking?

720
01:12:49.441 --> 01:12:50.609
Were you drinking?

721
01:13:04.706 --> 01:13:06.708
I'd had two beers.

722
01:13:11.838 --> 01:13:13.382
What's your excuse though?

723
01:13:16.385 --> 01:13:19.972
How you treat your friends, your family...

724
01:13:20.889 --> 01:13:24.434
Everybody there, just to be escaped from.
Just to be left behind.


725
01:13:25.143 --> 01:13:27.563
Like they let you down
instead of the other way around.


726
01:15:35.649 --> 01:15:36.692
And the other.

727
01:15:46.785 --> 01:15:48.120
I would like to go back.

728
01:15:50.205 --> 01:15:52.207
It's a very hard judgment call.

729
01:15:53.458 --> 01:15:55.377
I understand why you would think that.

730
01:15:55.878 --> 01:16:00.048
Do I still have any trace of my injury?
I'm sure.


731
01:16:00.716 --> 01:16:05.554
But am I going to be a risk to anybody,
unable to carry out my duties? No.


732
01:16:06.263 --> 01:16:07.931
I want to go where I'm useful.

733
01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.268
Can you go back? Yes.

734
01:16:12.311 --> 01:16:16.273
Should you go back?
It's a different question.


735
01:16:16.857 --> 01:16:19.610
You said the link between trauma
and depression is stronger


736
01:16:19.693 --> 01:16:21.737
than the link between smoking and cancer.

737
01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:23.155
Much stronger.

738
01:16:25.073 --> 01:16:27.284
What if Afghanistan
wasn't the only trauma?


739
01:16:29.578 --> 01:16:30.579
What then?

740
01:16:38.962 --> 01:16:42.257
Okay, Lynsey. I'll sign the waiver.

741
01:17:38.397 --> 01:17:40.023
It's James. Leave a message.

742
01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:05.048
You're all set. Bring it back
if it gives you any problems.


743
01:18:05.132 --> 01:18:07.384
Thanks. Is James in?

744
01:18:07.467 --> 01:18:09.845
Not today. No.

745
01:18:13.015 --> 01:18:14.735
All right.
Well, how much do I owe you guys?


746
01:18:15.225 --> 01:18:16.810
Didn't James tell you? It's free.

747
01:18:17.352 --> 01:18:18.353
What?

748
01:18:19.104 --> 01:18:21.106
Yeah, he said you were in the Army
or something.


749
01:19:33.595 --> 01:19:35.722
It's you.

750
01:19:35.806 --> 01:19:37.391
You're alive.

751
01:19:38.559 --> 01:19:40.852
Yeah I'm alive.

752
01:19:42.688 --> 01:19:44.481
It's been a long time.

753
01:19:46.858 --> 01:19:49.820
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.

754
01:19:52.364 --> 01:19:56.577
Don't worry. Mom hasn't come
to see me since sentencing.


755
01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:58.036
Really?

756
01:19:58.620 --> 01:19:59.705
Yeah.

757
01:20:00.414 --> 01:20:01.498
Is she okay?

758
01:20:02.916 --> 01:20:04.042
She's fine.

759
01:20:04.626 --> 01:20:08.171
I worry about her.

760
01:20:08.255 --> 01:20:10.674
She wrote me a letter.

761
01:20:12.259 --> 01:20:14.511
Seems like she's having a hard time.

762
01:20:16.221 --> 01:20:20.851
Mom can take care of herself.

763
01:20:22.519 --> 01:20:23.937
How are you?

764
01:20:24.938 --> 01:20:27.065
I'm good.

765
01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:30.903
You know. I'm comfortable.

766
01:20:32.279 --> 01:20:34.281
Are you healthy?

767
01:20:39.077 --> 01:20:41.371
Am I healthy?

768
01:20:41.914 --> 01:20:44.625
I've been trying to gain some weight.

769
01:20:45.292 --> 01:20:47.794
I've got some friends in here.

770
01:20:49.171 --> 01:20:51.673
There's not much to do.

771
01:20:52.174 --> 01:20:54.551
So I've been trying
to go to the gym.

772
01:21:01.892 --> 01:21:03.602
Honestly.

773
01:21:05.062 --> 01:21:08.190
I'm better off in here.

774
01:21:17.908 --> 01:21:20.369
I'm safe here.

775
01:21:20.452 --> 01:21:24.665
Out there, I don't trust myself.

776
01:21:31.964 --> 01:21:35.050
Enough about me.

777
01:21:35.884 --> 01:21:38.136
How are you?

778
01:21:41.807 --> 01:21:43.934
I'm good.

779
01:21:46.228 --> 01:21:47.980
I got hurt.

780
01:21:51.733 --> 01:21:54.152
But.

781
01:21:57.364 --> 01:21:59.408
I'm okay.

782
01:22:05.122 --> 01:22:08.625
I'm really sorry.

783
01:22:13.046 --> 01:22:17.050
I'm not sad for me.

784
01:22:21.471 --> 01:22:25.517
I'm just sorry too.

785
01:22:38.322 --> 01:22:40.240
I miss you.

786
01:22:40.824 --> 01:22:42.409
I miss you.

787
01:24:44.448 --> 01:24:45.449
What's going on?

788
01:24:47.367 --> 01:24:48.994
I know that truck ain't break down.

789
01:24:51.246 --> 01:24:55.000
Truck's fine. Thanks for that.
You didn't have to do that.


790
01:24:57.085 --> 01:24:58.295
So, what you doing here?

791
01:25:05.344 --> 01:25:10.599
You asked me if I wanted to move in,
remember?


792
01:25:13.101 --> 01:25:14.102
No.

793
01:25:19.608 --> 01:25:20.609
I remember.

794
01:25:38.293 --> 01:25:39.962
Would you wanna make the offer again?

795
01:25:47.261 --> 01:25:49.638
It would be good to have someone around.

796
01:25:50.722 --> 01:25:54.560
Have coffee with in the morning.
Smoke in the evening.


797
01:25:55.769 --> 01:25:57.271
Cook dinner sometimes.

798
01:26:00.649 --> 01:26:02.067
And what's that supposed to mean?

799
01:26:04.570 --> 01:26:05.737
They're all things you said.

800
01:26:11.702 --> 01:26:12.744
So…

801
01:26:16.707 --> 01:26:17.708
You're not leaving?

802
01:26:19.877 --> 01:26:23.297
I don't think so. 
Not now, at least.

803
01:26:36.351 --> 01:26:37.352
And.

804
01:26:39.187 --> 01:26:40.647
I'm trying to make a friend.
