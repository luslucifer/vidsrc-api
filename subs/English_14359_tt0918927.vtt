1
00:00:58.364 --> 00:01:02.701
Jimmy? Come on.
You're serving today.


2
00:01:03.536 --> 00:01:06.872
Christine?
Where's my pants?


3
00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:10.459
On the bed.
If they had teeth they would've bit you.


4
00:01:30.855 --> 00:01:33.815
Jimmy! Go to the store,
buy me the newspaper and cigarettes.


5
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.818
Can't. Serving mass. 
I'm an altar boy.

6
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.043
- Hey, Kevin!
- Hey, Jimmy!


7
00:02:23.283 --> 00:02:25.909
- There you are.
- Overslept.


8
00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:30.122
Well, you made it. I'll do the cruets
if you light the charcoal.


9
00:02:31.874 --> 00:02:33.625
You think I'm fat?

10
00:02:35.128 --> 00:02:37.879
You're all right. What?
Clothes don't fit?


11
00:02:37.964 --> 00:02:39.464
No, they fit.

12
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.897
You're gonna be going to the bakery
after mass.


13
00:02:55.982 --> 00:02:58.066
I am? Why don't you go?

14
00:02:58.151 --> 00:03:00.235
I'm gonna be making breakfast.

15
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.403
I can make breakfast.

16
00:03:01.487 --> 00:03:03.196
When have you ever?

17
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:04.948
Funny man.

18
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.244
Good morning, Connie.
- Good morning.


19
00:03:25.386 --> 00:03:27.929
Holy God, we praise thy name

20
00:03:28.014 --> 00:03:29.931
Good morning, Father.

21
00:03:31.768 --> 00:03:38.023
Lord of all, we bow before thee

22
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:44.780
All on Earth thy scepter claim

23
00:03:44.947 --> 00:03:51.453
All in heaven above adore thee

24
00:03:53.247 --> 00:03:57.542
Infinite thy vast domain

25
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.673
Everlasting is thy reign

26
00:04:04.634 --> 00:04:10.013
Infinite thy vast domain

27
00:04:10.973 --> 00:04:17.854
Everlasting is thy reign

28
00:04:22.193 --> 00:04:23.568
Be seated.

29
00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:40.001
What do you do when you're not sure?

30
00:04:42.213 --> 00:04:44.840
That's the topic of my sermon today.

31
00:04:46.676 --> 00:04:50.053
Last year when
Predisent Kennedy was assassinated,


32
00:04:50.847 --> 00:04:55.350
who among us did not experience
the most profound disorientation?


33
00:04:55.435 --> 00:04:56.768
Despair?

34
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.565
Which way? What now?

35
00:05:03.526 --> 00:05:07.446
What do I say to my kids?
What do I tell myself?


36
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.867
It was a time of people sitting together.

37
00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:16.246
Bound together
by a common feeling of hopelessness.


38
00:05:18.374 --> 00:05:20.083
But think of that.

39
00:05:21.878 --> 00:05:26.715
Your bond with your fellow being
was your despair.


40
00:05:28.885 --> 00:05:32.637
It was a public experience.
It was awful,


41
00:05:32.722 --> 00:05:34.723
but we were in it together.

42
00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:42.898
How much worse is it then
for the lone man, the lone woman,


43
00:05:44.108 --> 00:05:46.568
stricken by a private calamity?

44
00:05:47.653 --> 00:05:53.909
"No one knows I'm sick. " "No one
knows I've lost my last real friend. "


45
00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:59.498
"No one knows
I've done something wrong. "


46
00:06:00.458 --> 00:06:02.417
Imagine the isolation.

47
00:06:03.836 --> 00:06:07.005
Now you see the world
as through a window.


48
00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:10.300
On one side of the glass,
happy untroubled people,


49
00:06:10.426 --> 00:06:13.011
and on the other side, you.

50
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:17.474
- God bless you, Sister.
- Thank you.


51
00:06:18.142 --> 00:06:20.268
I wanna tell you a story.

52
00:06:22.855 --> 00:06:27.984
A cargo ship sank one night.
It caught fire and went down,


53
00:06:29.153 --> 00:06:31.738
and only this one sailor survived.

54
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.243
He found a lifeboat, rigged a sail,

55
00:06:36.327 --> 00:06:37.786
and being of a nautical discipline

56
00:06:37.912 --> 00:06:41.790
tumed his eyes to the heavens
and read the stars.


57
00:06:41.874 --> 00:06:45.919
He set a course for his home,
and, exhausted, fell asleep.


58
00:06:46.671 --> 00:06:47.796
Just keeps going on.

59
00:06:47.922 --> 00:06:49.631
Clouds rolled in,

60
00:06:50.675 --> 00:06:56.805
and for the next 20 nights,
he could no longer see the stars.


61
00:06:58.307 --> 00:07:02.477
He thought he was on course,
but there was no way to be certain.


62
00:07:03.854 --> 00:07:08.108
And as the days rolled on,
and the sailor wasted away,


63
00:07:10.152 --> 00:07:12.445
he began to have doubts.

64
00:07:13.155 --> 00:07:17.367
- He just keeps on going.
- Had he set his course right?


65
00:07:17.493 --> 00:07:20.996
Was he still going on
towards his home?


66
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:27.002
Or was he horribly lost
and doomed to a terrible death?


67
00:07:28.963 --> 00:07:30.547
No way to know.

68
00:07:31.465 --> 00:07:34.843
The message of the constellations,

69
00:07:34.927 --> 00:07:39.639
had he imagined it because
of his desperate circumstance?


70
00:07:39.724 --> 00:07:43.685
- Or had he seen truth once...
- Straighten up!


71
00:07:43.769 --> 00:07:48.857
...and now had to hold on to it
without further reassurance?


72
00:07:50.818 --> 00:07:53.528
There are those of you in church today

73
00:07:53.654 --> 00:07:56.906
who know exactly
the crisis of faith I describe,


74
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:00.827
and I wanna say to you,

75
00:08:02.872 --> 00:08:08.710
doubt can be a bond as powerful
and sustaining as certainty.


76
00:08:11.672 --> 00:08:15.884
When you are lost, you are not alone.

77
00:08:21.849 --> 00:08:25.268
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.


78
00:08:28.105 --> 00:08:29.564
Please rise.

79
00:08:31.859 --> 00:08:37.572
Praise God,
from whom all blessings flow


80
00:08:37.907 --> 00:08:42.118
Praise him all creatures here...

81
00:08:53.923 --> 00:08:57.258
- Hey, Father.
- Hey, champ.


82
00:08:58.928 --> 00:09:00.804
That was some sermon.

83
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:04.766
Did it mean something to you?

84
00:09:05.601 --> 00:09:08.478
I wanna do that. 
I wanna be a priest.

85
00:09:10.398 --> 00:09:14.609
You'd be a good one, I'm sure. Here.

86
00:09:20.658 --> 00:09:22.242
Take a look.

87
00:09:29.125 --> 00:09:30.291
See?

88
00:09:32.795 --> 00:09:37.298
- She's dancing. Kind of neat?
- Yeah.


89
00:09:37.425 --> 00:09:39.008
Here. You try.

90
00:09:49.937 --> 00:09:52.647
That's for you. Take it.

91
00:09:52.732 --> 00:09:54.983
- Thank you, Father.
- Welcome.


92
00:11:21.403 --> 00:11:23.571
Like Noah's Ark, girls. Two by two.

93
00:11:23.697 --> 00:11:25.281
Maryanne said it.
Let's do it together.


94
00:11:25.407 --> 00:11:26.574
Okay.
Yeah. It's true.


95
00:11:26.659 --> 00:11:29.118
And did I tell you that Jessica's
having a sleepover on Saturday?


96
00:11:29.203 --> 00:11:31.079
Morning, Sister James.

97
00:11:31.163 --> 00:11:32.914
Good morning, Father Flynn.
Beautiful day.


98
00:11:32.998 --> 00:11:35.416
Not too bad.
How're the criminals doing today?


99
00:11:35.543 --> 00:11:38.253
- Not bad, Father.
- Good, Father.


100
00:11:38.337 --> 00:11:41.089
- Morning, champ.
- Morning, Father Flynn.


101
00:11:41.215 --> 00:11:43.049
You wash those hands today,
Mr. London?


102
00:11:43.133 --> 00:11:44.884
I washed them, Father.

103
00:11:44.969 --> 00:11:47.011
I don't know. They're a different color
than your neck.


104
00:11:49.223 --> 00:11:51.641
Morning.
Morning, Father Flynn.


105
00:11:52.393 --> 00:11:54.727
- Sister, are we having the test today?
Get in line.


106
00:11:54.812 --> 00:11:56.396
Tomorrow, William.

107
00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.731
- Is it long division?
- Among other things.


108
00:11:58.816 --> 00:12:01.484
Sister.
- Good morning, Sister.


109
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.612
- How much of it will be long division?
Boy!


110
00:12:06.115 --> 00:12:09.450
William London. Come up here.

111
00:12:12.246 --> 00:12:19.127
Come smartly, now.
Don't make me wait.


112
00:12:21.338 --> 00:12:25.133
What did he do?
He touched Sister James.


113
00:12:25.217 --> 00:12:26.843
The dragon is hungry.

114
00:12:26.969 --> 00:12:28.845
You don't touch a nun.

115
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:42.150
Take out your history books, please.
Turn to page 683.


116
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.531
- Yes, Ralph.
- I forgot my history book.


117
00:12:48.657 --> 00:12:50.950
You can look on with Raymond.

118
00:12:52.828 --> 00:12:54.829
Mr. London?

119
00:12:54.955 --> 00:12:57.957
- Do you have your history book?
- No, Sister.


120
00:12:58.042 --> 00:13:02.337
- Share with Mr. Malloy, please.
- Do I have to? His breath stinks!


121
00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:10.386
I'm sure Mr. Malloy's breath is just fine.

122
00:13:14.308 --> 00:13:15.683
Be seated.

123
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:24.359
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the

124
00:13:24.485 --> 00:13:28.321
That barrette out of your hair,
Miss Horan.


125
00:13:28.405 --> 00:13:29.864
Yes, Sister.

126
00:13:30.741 --> 00:13:33.701
Morning, Sister James.
Continue.


127
00:13:34.536 --> 00:13:36.162
Franklin D. Roosevelt, together with

128
00:13:36.246 --> 00:13:39.374
Abraham Lincoln
and John Fitzgerald Kennedy,


129
00:13:39.458 --> 00:13:42.752
was perhaps our greatest president.
When he assumed office,


130
00:13:42.878 --> 00:13:45.922
13 million people in this country
were unemployed.


131
00:13:46.048 --> 00:13:47.507
They'd lost hope,

132
00:13:47.591 --> 00:13:49.717
and President Roosevelt
said to these people,


133
00:13:49.802 --> 00:13:54.055
'"The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself. "


134
00:13:55.224 --> 00:13:58.601
What did he mean by that? James?

135
00:14:00.229 --> 00:14:02.271
I think he was trying to say
there's nothing really wrong.


136
00:14:02.398 --> 00:14:06.859
- You know? So don't get so emotional.
Maybe.


137
00:14:06.944 --> 00:14:09.946
Maybe he was saying that
the world is good


138
00:14:10.072 --> 00:14:12.782
and we need only work together
to overcome our problems.


139
00:14:12.908 --> 00:14:14.909
What's this, Mr. Conroy?

140
00:14:17.162 --> 00:14:19.038
I don't know, Sister.

141
00:14:21.417 --> 00:14:25.753
You don't know you have a wire
coming out of your ear?


142
00:14:25.879 --> 00:14:26.963
No.

143
00:14:30.592 --> 00:14:32.468
No, Sister. I didn't.

144
00:14:36.056 --> 00:14:37.932
You come with me, boy.

145
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:47.066
Go.

146
00:14:54.992 --> 00:14:57.118
Who knows what the New Deal was?

147
00:14:57.953 --> 00:15:01.539
The first noel

148
00:15:01.623 --> 00:15:05.001
The angels did say

149
00:15:05.085 --> 00:15:10.757
was to certain poor shepherds
in fields as they lay


150
00:15:10.841 --> 00:15:12.592
I love this song.

151
00:15:12.718 --> 00:15:18.639
In fields where they lay
keeping their sheep


152
00:15:19.058 --> 00:15:25.480
On a cold winter's night
that was so deep


153
00:16:38.554 --> 00:16:44.725
This past Sunday, what do you think
that sermon was about? Sister James?


154
00:16:47.104 --> 00:16:49.730
What was
Father Flynn's sermon about?


155
00:16:52.192 --> 00:16:56.863
Well, doubt.
He was talking about doubt.


156
00:16:58.282 --> 00:17:02.410
- Why?
- Excuse me, Sister?


157
00:17:02.494 --> 00:17:05.580
Well, sermons come from somewhere,
don't they?


158
00:17:05.706 --> 00:17:07.957
Is Father Flynn in doubt?

159
00:17:08.083 --> 00:17:11.252
Is he concerned
that someone else is in doubt?


160
00:17:12.212 --> 00:17:13.796
I suppose you'd have to ask him.

161
00:17:13.922 --> 00:17:16.048
No, that would not be appropriate.

162
00:17:16.133 --> 00:17:17.592
He is my superior,

163
00:17:17.718 --> 00:17:20.595
and if he were troubled
he should confess it to a fellow priest


164
00:17:20.679 --> 00:17:22.388
or to the monsignor.

165
00:17:22.472 --> 00:17:25.099
We do not share
intimate information with priests.


166
00:17:25.184 --> 00:17:27.101
- No.
- That's true.


167
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:31.981
What are we saying?

168
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.443
I want you all to be alert.

169
00:17:35.527 --> 00:17:42.450
I am concerned, perhaps needlessly,
about matters in St. Nicholas School.


170
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.581
Academically?

171
00:17:50.584 --> 00:17:53.961
I was not inviting a guessing game,
Sister Raymond.


172
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.905
Missy! Get away from her,
and sit down.


173
00:19:09.579 --> 00:19:13.124
- May I join you, Sister Aloysius?
- Yes.


174
00:19:16.336 --> 00:19:20.131
- ChiVn chow mein.
- Sister Veronica's favorite.


175
00:19:20.215 --> 00:19:22.300
It's very good.

176
00:19:22.384 --> 00:19:25.553
I like the noodles. 
I like the crunch.

177
00:19:28.307 --> 00:19:32.143
- What happened to William London?
- I sent him home.


178
00:19:32.227 --> 00:19:36.314
- Oh, dear. So he's still bleeding?
- Yes.


179
00:19:37.399 --> 00:19:38.482
His nose just let loose

180
00:19:38.567 --> 00:19:41.068
and started gushing
during the Pledge of Allegiance.


181
00:19:41.153 --> 00:19:42.737
Was it spontaneous?

182
00:19:42.821 --> 00:19:45.031
- What?
- His nosebleed.


183
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.036
- What else would it be?
- Self-induced.


184
00:19:51.246 --> 00:19:52.371
You mean you think

185
00:19:52.456 --> 00:19:55.750
he might have intentionally
given himself a nosebleed?


186
00:19:55.876 --> 00:19:57.168
Exactly.

187
00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.503
No.

188
00:20:02.382 --> 00:20:05.426
You are a very innocent person,
Sister James.


189
00:20:06.428 --> 00:20:08.387
William London is a fidgety boy.

190
00:20:08.472 --> 00:20:11.766
If you do not keep right on him,
he will do anything to escape his chair.


191
00:20:11.892 --> 00:20:16.187
He would set his foot on fire
for half a day out of school.


192
00:20:16.271 --> 00:20:19.857
Here. Sister, allow me to help you.
Your sleeve.


193
00:20:20.609 --> 00:20:21.817
Uh-oh.

194
00:20:23.403 --> 00:20:26.280
- Let's see.
- Oh, thank you, Sister.


195
00:20:29.409 --> 00:20:33.412
- Sister Veronica is going blind.
- Oh, how horrible.


196
00:20:33.497 --> 00:20:35.790
If they find out in the rectory,
she'll be gone.


197
00:20:35.916 --> 00:20:39.210
So if she looks unsteady,
take her hand.


198
00:20:40.796 --> 00:20:46.801
Ordinarily I assign my most
experienced teachers to eighth grade,


199
00:20:47.719 --> 00:20:51.305
but I am working within constraints.

200
00:20:53.433 --> 00:20:57.311
- Are you in control of your class?
- I think so.


201
00:20:58.397 --> 00:21:01.315
Usually more students
are sent down to me.


202
00:21:02.943 --> 00:21:05.069
I try to take care of things myself.

203
00:21:05.153 --> 00:21:07.154
That can be an error.

204
00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.658
You are answerable to me,
I to the monsignor,


205
00:21:10.742 --> 00:21:13.411
he to the bishop,
and so on up to the Holy Father.


206
00:21:13.495 --> 00:21:16.080
There is a chain. 
Make use of it.

207
00:21:18.458 --> 00:21:19.667
Candy?

208
00:21:20.335 --> 00:21:21.669
Cough drops.

209
00:21:21.753 --> 00:21:24.088
Candy by another name.

210
00:21:26.508 --> 00:21:28.467
How is Donald Miller doing?

211
00:21:28.552 --> 00:21:30.761
- Steady.
- Good.


212
00:21:32.597 --> 00:21:36.016
That girl, Noreen Horan.

213
00:21:36.143 --> 00:21:39.186
I've seated her
as far away from the boys as possible.


214
00:21:39.312 --> 00:21:41.689
Doesn't do much good.

215
00:21:42.023 --> 00:21:46.026
Just get her through intact.

216
00:21:50.449 --> 00:21:51.949
What's this?

217
00:21:54.077 --> 00:21:59.707
The wind is so peripatetic this year.

218
00:22:01.543 --> 00:22:05.296
- Is that the word I want?
Is something the matter?


219
00:22:07.048 --> 00:22:08.048
What?

220
00:22:08.175 --> 00:22:10.468
Is something the matter?
No.


221
00:22:11.511 --> 00:22:16.390
- Why? Is something the matter?
- I don't think so.


222
00:22:16.516 --> 00:22:20.060
- Well, then, nothing's the matter then.
- Yes.


223
00:22:20.145 --> 00:22:23.063
- What's this?
- A pen.


224
00:22:23.815 --> 00:22:25.566
A ballpoint pen.

225
00:22:26.568 --> 00:22:29.904
The students are not using them
for assignments, I hope.


226
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.071
No, of course not.

227
00:22:31.198 --> 00:22:34.408
I am sorry I allowed even
catrtidge pens into this school.


228
00:22:34.534 --> 00:22:36.994
Always easy way out, these days.

229
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:42.416
Every easy choice today
will have its consequence tomorrow.


230
00:22:42.542 --> 00:22:44.502
- Mark my words.
- Yes, Sister.


231
00:22:44.586 --> 00:22:46.504
Ballpoints make them press down.

232
00:22:46.588 --> 00:22:48.422
When they press down,
they write like monkeys.


233
00:22:48.548 --> 00:22:52.384
- I don't allow them ballpoint pens.
- And yet here one is.


234
00:22:54.387 --> 00:22:58.349
Penmanship is dying
all across this country.


235
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.559
I hope not.

236
00:23:02.062 --> 00:23:04.563
You should frame something.

237
00:23:04.648 --> 00:23:08.943
Put it up on the blackboard.
Put the pope up.


238
00:23:10.028 --> 00:23:12.446
That's the wrong pope. 
He's deceased.

239
00:23:12.531 --> 00:23:17.284
I don't care what pope it is.
Use the glass to see behind you.


240
00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:21.539
Children should think you have eyes
in the back of your head.


241
00:23:21.623 --> 00:23:23.582
Wouldn't that be a little frightening?

242
00:23:23.667 --> 00:23:26.460
Only to the ones
who are up to no good.


243
00:23:33.385 --> 00:23:35.386
Relax. Put it up there.

244
00:23:37.889 --> 00:23:39.473
All right, now.

245
00:23:40.809 --> 00:23:44.728
The thing about shooting
from the foul line is it's psychological.


246
00:23:44.813 --> 00:23:47.606
All right, come up with a routine.

247
00:23:47.691 --> 00:23:50.526
You shift your weight, move your hips...

248
00:23:51.736 --> 00:23:53.028
Yeah, you think that's funny, Ralph?

249
00:23:53.113 --> 00:23:54.780
You know what's funny is
you never getting a foul shot.


250
00:23:56.116 --> 00:24:01.495
All right, concentrate on the routine,
and you'll forget to get tensed up.


251
00:24:03.665 --> 00:24:05.916
All right, go ahead, Jimmy.

252
00:24:10.213 --> 00:24:15.509
Good man. You listen. That's good.
All right, now sit down, everyone.


253
00:24:16.803 --> 00:24:18.012
Good.

254
00:24:18.847 --> 00:24:24.351
On another matter, I've noticed
several of you guys got dirty nails.


255
00:24:25.854 --> 00:24:28.022
All right, I don't want to see that.

256
00:24:28.148 --> 00:24:29.690
I'm not talking about
the length of your nails.


257
00:24:29.816 --> 00:24:32.276
I'm talking about cleanliness.

258
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.361
See, look at my nails.

259
00:24:38.366 --> 00:24:40.701
All right, they're long.

260
00:24:41.369 --> 00:24:47.207
Yeah, I like them a little long,
but look at how clean they are.


261
00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:58.802
That makes it okay.

262
00:25:02.682 --> 00:25:06.894
The climpity-clomp.
Clomp-clomp-clomp.


263
00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.229
Harder than a herd of elephants.

264
00:25:14.069 --> 00:25:15.903
You are wicked!

265
00:25:15.987 --> 00:25:17.905
No, I told her, '
You're her mother.

266
00:25:18.031 --> 00:25:21.200
'You raised her. You fed her.
You tell her she's fat. "


267
00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:23.911
But wait, how fat is she?

268
00:25:23.995 --> 00:25:26.664
- What, the mother or the daughter?
- The daughter.


269
00:25:26.748 --> 00:25:28.040
I never met the daughter.

270
00:25:28.124 --> 00:25:30.417
- What about the mother?
- Fat.


271
00:26:24.389 --> 00:26:27.224
Father, we having practice
after school?


272
00:26:27.308 --> 00:26:30.602
If you guys want it, we can have it.
Let me know.


273
00:26:32.439 --> 00:26:36.650
The Fascist governments
of Germany and Italy


274
00:26:36.776 --> 00:26:39.153
were already working together.

275
00:26:39.821 --> 00:26:42.156
They formed the Pact of Steel.

276
00:26:43.158 --> 00:26:44.658
The Pact of Steel was...

277
00:26:44.743 --> 00:26:45.909
- Hi.
- Hi.


278
00:26:45.994 --> 00:26:50.831
...a military alliance between
Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler.


279
00:26:50.915 --> 00:26:55.502
Mr. London, get back in your seat
and stop bothering Miss Horan, please.


280
00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:00.340
Now, who can tell me...

281
00:27:04.804 --> 00:27:06.138
Yes?

282
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.183
Yes. Of course, Father.

283
00:27:11.311 --> 00:27:14.021
Donald? You should go to the rectory.

284
00:27:19.694 --> 00:27:25.532
Two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven.


285
00:27:25.617 --> 00:27:31.872
Go one, two, three, touch.
One, two, three, kick.


286
00:27:31.998 --> 00:27:37.211
And back, side, front, kick.
Back, side, front. Again.


287
00:27:37.295 --> 00:27:39.379
we began to dance

288
00:27:39.881 --> 00:27:42.090
Swaying to and fro

289
00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:47.304
And soon I knew
I'd never let him go


290
00:27:48.223 --> 00:27:51.141
- Raymond, what are you doing?
- The mashed potato.


291
00:27:51.226 --> 00:27:53.393
You're supposed to be doing
the bossa nova.


292
00:27:53.478 --> 00:27:55.604
But I know the mashed potato.

293
00:27:58.525 --> 00:28:03.320
All right, now follow.
Back, side, front, kick.


294
00:28:03.404 --> 00:28:08.325
Back, side... One, two, three, kick.

295
00:28:08.409 --> 00:28:13.247
Back, side, front, kick.
Back, side, front...


296
00:28:15.542 --> 00:28:18.919
Let me get in front of you
so that you can see what I'm doing.


297
00:28:20.046 --> 00:28:22.881
And one, two, three, touch.

298
00:28:22.966 --> 00:28:26.051
One, two, three, kick.

299
00:28:26.135 --> 00:28:31.056
Back, side, front, kick.
Back, side, front...


300
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:36.687
Okay. This is really good.
Very good there.


301
00:28:36.771 --> 00:28:38.605
Now I'm glad to say

302
00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:40.607
I'm his bride to be

303
00:28:41.901 --> 00:28:46.822
And we're gonna raise a family

304
00:29:17.979 --> 00:29:21.148
Donald, are you feeling ill?
- No.


305
00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:24.818
- Are you sure?
- Yes.


306
00:29:26.613 --> 00:29:31.325
- Are you all right?
- I just want to go home.


307
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:56.433
- Good afternoon, Sister.
- Good afternoon, Sister James.


308
00:29:56.517 --> 00:29:59.811
Sister, can I speak with you
about Donald Miller?


309
00:30:02.649 --> 00:30:06.026
Is he being accepted?
He has no friends.


310
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:09.863
That would be a lot
to expect after only two months.


311
00:30:11.491 --> 00:30:14.201
- Has anyone hit him?
- No.


312
00:30:15.536 --> 00:30:17.704
Someone will.

313
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:23.877
And when that happens,
send them right down to me.


314
00:30:25.505 --> 00:30:27.714
I'm not so sure anyone will.

315
00:30:29.384 --> 00:30:32.344
This parish serves Irish
and Italian families.


316
00:30:32.428 --> 00:30:34.846
Someone will hit Donald Miller.

317
00:30:36.349 --> 00:30:38.141
He has a protector.

318
00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:39.893
Who?

319
00:30:46.025 --> 00:30:47.526
Father Flynn.

320
00:30:54.033 --> 00:30:55.200
What?

321
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.081
He's taken an interest.

322
00:31:18.349 --> 00:31:21.935
I told you to come to me,
but I hoped you never would.


323
00:31:23.271 --> 00:31:24.604
Maybe I shouldn't have.

324
00:31:27.567 --> 00:31:29.568
So, it's happened.

325
00:31:31.112 --> 00:31:35.949
What? Oh, no. I'm not telling you that.
I'm not even certain what you mean.


326
00:31:36.576 --> 00:31:38.410
Oh, excuse me there, Sisters.

327
00:31:38.494 --> 00:31:41.371
No bother. We're done here.
Come, Sister.


328
00:31:52.258 --> 00:31:54.051
What have you seen?

329
00:31:55.636 --> 00:31:57.679
It is unsettling
to look at people with suspicion.


330
00:31:57.764 --> 00:31:59.389
I feel less close to God.

331
00:31:59.474 --> 00:32:01.600
When you take a step
to address wrongdoing,


332
00:32:01.684 --> 00:32:05.979
you are taking a step away from God,
but in his service.


333
00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:08.565
What have you seen?

334
00:32:11.069 --> 00:32:12.319
Good afternoon, Sisters.

335
00:32:12.403 --> 00:32:15.155
Good afternoon, Mrs. Carson.
Why the cat?


336
00:32:15.239 --> 00:32:17.866
'Cause there's a mouse.
Want some tea?


337
00:32:18.409 --> 00:32:20.869
If you don't want to dance with her,
don't dance with her.


338
00:32:20.953 --> 00:32:22.996
- Well, is it wrong?
- No.


339
00:32:24.624 --> 00:32:26.666
But what if the girl turns you down?

340
00:32:28.795 --> 00:32:31.922
All right, you have the right
to ask a girl to dance.


341
00:32:32.006 --> 00:32:34.758
All right,
she has the right to turn you down.


342
00:32:34.842 --> 00:32:38.303
The trick is, don't take it to heart.

343
00:32:38.387 --> 00:32:40.764
What if they all turn you down?

344
00:32:41.641 --> 00:32:43.225
Well, then you become a priest.

345
00:32:49.816 --> 00:32:51.399
All right, next question.

346
00:33:00.868 --> 00:33:02.661
What have you seen?

347
00:33:07.291 --> 00:33:10.335
He called Donald Miller to the rectory.

348
00:33:10.419 --> 00:33:12.129
- What for?
- A talk.


349
00:33:12.213 --> 00:33:13.296
- Alone?
- Yes.


350
00:33:13.381 --> 00:33:16.383
- When?
- A week ago during class.


351
00:33:16.467 --> 00:33:18.093
Why didn't you tell me?

352
00:33:18.177 --> 00:33:21.429
I didn't think
there was anything wrong with it.


353
00:33:27.103 --> 00:33:29.729
Of all the children, 
Donald Miller.

354
00:33:31.524 --> 00:33:32.899
I suppose it makes sense.

355
00:33:32.984 --> 00:33:36.153
- How does it make sense?
- He's isolated.


356
00:33:36.237 --> 00:33:40.407
- I don't know that anything is wrong.
- Our first Negro student.


357
00:33:41.617 --> 00:33:44.911
I thought there would be fighting.
Thought we...


358
00:33:46.372 --> 00:33:48.790
A parent or two to deal with.

359
00:33:51.586 --> 00:33:54.421
I should have foreseen this possibility.

360
00:33:55.631 --> 00:33:56.715
How could you imagine it?

361
00:33:56.799 --> 00:34:00.552
Well, it's my job
to outshine the fox in cleverness.


362
00:34:05.057 --> 00:34:07.976
- That is my job.
- But maybe it's nothing.


363
00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:15.442
Then why do you look like
you've seen the devil?


364
00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:22.532
It's just the way the boy acted
when he came back to class.


365
00:34:22.617 --> 00:34:24.618
- He said something?
- No, it was his expression.


366
00:34:24.702 --> 00:34:26.578
He looked frightened.

367
00:34:26.662 --> 00:34:30.999
And he put his head on the desk
in the most peculiar way, and...


368
00:34:33.294 --> 00:34:38.215
And one other thing,
I think there was alcohol on his breath.


369
00:34:43.596 --> 00:34:47.599
There was alcohol on his breath.

370
00:35:03.741 --> 00:35:06.952
Years ago at Saint Boniface
there was a priest.


371
00:35:12.083 --> 00:35:16.253
But I had Father Scully then.

372
00:35:20.091 --> 00:35:23.635
Here, there's no man I can go to.
Men run everything.


373
00:35:24.637 --> 00:35:27.764
We are going to have to
stop him ourselves.


374
00:35:30.393 --> 00:35:33.645
There we go. She
got him. Takes a cat.

375
00:35:36.023 --> 00:35:37.565
Yes, it does.

376
00:35:44.282 --> 00:35:46.324
Yes, it does.

377
00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.295
(RAINING HEAVILY

378
00:36:27.533 --> 00:36:29.326
This towel
will never be dead white again.


379
00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:30.785
Yes, it will.

380
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:33.330
Mrs. Carson.
I'm fine.


381
00:36:33.831 --> 00:36:36.458
- What happened?
- There's a branch down.


382
00:36:36.542 --> 00:36:38.418
- Are you all right, Sister?
She didn't see it.


383
00:36:38.502 --> 00:36:42.630
Fine. Just bushwhacked.
No need for a fuss.


384
00:36:42.715 --> 00:36:44.674
You just go lie down.
I'll bring you some tea.


385
00:36:44.759 --> 00:36:46.593
Come with me.
I just...


386
00:36:46.677 --> 00:36:49.554
I'll get you a compress.
- I did not fail to see it.


387
00:36:50.264 --> 00:36:52.307
- MR. McGUINN: Hello? Yes, Sister.
- Mr. McGuinn.


388
00:36:52.391 --> 00:36:55.435
Could you look in on the courtyard?
I've got branches falling.


389
00:36:55.519 --> 00:36:57.687
- What has?
- A branch has!


390
00:37:02.026 --> 00:37:06.946
Watch your step here, Sister.
I'll cut it up.


391
00:37:09.116 --> 00:37:11.659
The world is crashing, Michael.

392
00:37:11.744 --> 00:37:15.080
I haven't heard a wind like that
since I left Mullingar.


393
00:37:15.164 --> 00:37:18.750
I've never known a wind like it.
The wind has changed.


394
00:37:41.857 --> 00:37:44.484
What are you doing out here, Conroy?

395
00:37:45.486 --> 00:37:47.612
I talked in class, Father.

396
00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:02.085
Waiting for Sister Aloysius.

397
00:38:05.548 --> 00:38:08.758
- She know you're here?
- She knows.


398
00:38:12.263 --> 00:38:14.347
Good morning, Father Flynn.
Good of you to come by.


399
00:38:14.432 --> 00:38:16.391
Morning, Sister Aloysius.
How are you today?


400
00:38:16.475 --> 00:38:17.642
I'm very well, thank you.

401
00:38:17.726 --> 00:38:19.853
- Mr. Conroy.
- Yes, Sister.


402
00:38:19.937 --> 00:38:21.855
Mr. Transistor Radio.

403
00:38:23.524 --> 00:38:25.775
Multiplication table, 10 times,
in its totality,


404
00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.694
delivered to me tomorrow morning.

405
00:38:27.778 --> 00:38:29.112
Legible, boy.

406
00:38:30.614 --> 00:38:34.242
Return to class. Go. Go, go.

407
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.423
I'd invite you in,
but we're just short Sister James.


408
00:38:55.097 --> 00:38:58.183
- Hear that wind last night?
- I certainly did.


409
00:39:02.313 --> 00:39:04.105
Did I hear
Sister Veronica had an accident?


410
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:07.775
Yeah. Sister Veronica fell,
practically killed herself.


411
00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:10.320
- Is she all right?
- Oh, she's fine.


412
00:39:13.032 --> 00:39:17.535
- Her sight isn't good, is it?
- Her sight is fine. Nuns fall, you know.


413
00:39:19.455 --> 00:39:20.663
Nah, I didn't know that.

414
00:39:20.748 --> 00:39:24.292
It's the habit.
It catches us up more often than not.


415
00:39:26.545 --> 00:39:28.588
We go down like dominoes.

416
00:39:29.924 --> 00:39:32.383
- Am I past the time?
- Not at all.


417
00:39:32.468 --> 00:39:34.052
Good morning, Father.
Good morning, Sister.


418
00:39:34.136 --> 00:39:36.304
I'm sorry I was delayed.

419
00:39:36.388 --> 00:39:39.140
- I ran into Sister Veronica.
- How is she?


420
00:39:39.225 --> 00:39:41.976
I'm afraid
she has a bit of a bloody nose.


421
00:39:42.061 --> 00:39:45.188
I'm beginning to think
you're punching people.


422
00:39:46.649 --> 00:39:47.941
Sister?

423
00:39:48.025 --> 00:39:50.860
First, William London and now...

424
00:39:53.155 --> 00:39:58.076
- Never mind. Well, come in, please.
- Sister.


425
00:40:00.246 --> 00:40:04.123
Please. Sit. Have a seat.

426
00:40:04.208 --> 00:40:06.000
I actually have a hot pot of tea.

427
00:40:06.085 --> 00:40:10.171
And close this,
but not quite for form's sake.


428
00:40:11.006 --> 00:40:13.424
Father, would you care for a...

429
00:40:15.469 --> 00:40:19.556
- Would you have a cup of tea, Father?
- I'd love a cup of tea.


430
00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.308
- Sister, perhaps you could serve him.
- I'd be glad.


431
00:40:22.393 --> 00:40:23.726
And yourself, of course.

432
00:40:23.811 --> 00:40:25.019
Would you like a cup of tea,
Sister Aloysius?


433
00:40:25.104 --> 00:40:26.854
No, I've already had my cup.

434
00:40:26.939 --> 00:40:30.441
- Is there sugar?
- Sugar?


435
00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:39.117
Yes, yes. Somewhere here.

436
00:40:40.786 --> 00:40:45.081
I put it in the drawer for Lent last year.
Never remembered to take it out.


437
00:40:45.165 --> 00:40:47.166
It mustn't have been much
to give up, then.


438
00:40:49.795 --> 00:40:52.714
I'm sure you're right.
Here it is.


439
00:40:52.798 --> 00:40:59.429
I'll serve you, although
for want of practice I'm a little clumsy.


440
00:41:01.307 --> 00:41:06.144
- I see your fingernails.
- Wear them a little long.


441
00:41:07.813 --> 00:41:09.522
- The sugar?
- Yes. One?


442
00:41:09.607 --> 00:41:10.815
Three.

443
00:41:11.817 --> 00:41:13.735
- Three?
- Sweet tooth.


444
00:41:14.236 --> 00:41:17.280
Two. Three.

445
00:41:18.365 --> 00:41:21.492
- Sister, you care for sugar?
- Never.


446
00:41:21.577 --> 00:41:24.579
Not that there's
anything wrong with sugar.


447
00:41:25.998 --> 00:41:28.833
Well, thank you, Father,
for making time for us.


448
00:41:28.917 --> 00:41:30.627
We are at our wit's end.

449
00:41:30.711 --> 00:41:34.839
I think it's an excellent idea
to rethink the Christmas pageant,


450
00:41:34.923 --> 00:41:38.051
'cause last year's effort
was a little woebegone.


451
00:41:38.135 --> 00:41:42.013
Oh, I loved it, but I love all pageants.
The hymns.


452
00:41:42.097 --> 00:41:45.516
O Little Town of Bethlehem, O Come,
O Come, Emmanuel, O Come...


453
00:41:45.601 --> 00:41:47.935
All right.
Thank you, Sister James.


454
00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.103
So what do you think, Father?

455
00:41:49.188 --> 00:41:51.564
Is there something new we could do?

456
00:41:51.649 --> 00:41:54.150
Well, we all love the Christmas hymns,

457
00:41:54.234 --> 00:41:57.945
but it might be jolly
to include a secular song.


458
00:41:58.447 --> 00:42:00.281
- Secular?
- Yes.


459
00:42:00.366 --> 00:42:03.493
It's Beginning To Look A Lot
Like ChristmaS. Something like that.


460
00:42:03.577 --> 00:42:07.163
What would be
the point of a secular song?


461
00:42:07.247 --> 00:42:08.456
Just fun.

462
00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.667
- Or Frosty the Snowman.
That's a good one.


463
00:42:10.751 --> 00:42:15.046
We could have one of the boys
dress up as a snowman, dance around.


464
00:42:15.839 --> 00:42:17.215
Which boy?

465
00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.762
We'd do tryouts.

466
00:42:22.846 --> 00:42:27.433
Frosty the Snowman
espouses a pagan belief in magic.


467
00:42:27.518 --> 00:42:31.521
The snowman comes to life when
an enchanted hat is put on his head.


468
00:42:31.605 --> 00:42:33.106
If the music were more somber,

469
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:38.361
people would realize the images
are disturbing and the song heretical.


470
00:42:38.445 --> 00:42:41.823
I never thought about
Frosty the Snowman like that.


471
00:42:41.907 --> 00:42:43.074
It should be banned from the airwaves.

472
00:42:43.158 --> 00:42:45.410
So, not Frosty the Snowman.

473
00:42:45.494 --> 00:42:51.416
Oh, It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like
Christmas would be fine, I suppose.


474
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.459
Parents would like it.

475
00:42:55.337 --> 00:42:59.716
May I ask what you're writing down
with that ballpoint pen?


476
00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:03.177
Oh, nothing. It's an idea for a sermon.

477
00:43:03.595 --> 00:43:07.265
- Oh. You had one right now?
- I get them all the time.


478
00:43:07.641 --> 00:43:09.142
How fortunate.

479
00:43:09.226 --> 00:43:11.644
I forget them,
so I have to write them down.


480
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:14.939
What is the idea?

481
00:43:17.067 --> 00:43:18.526
Intolerance.

482
00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:25.867
Would you like
a little more tea, Father?


483
00:43:25.951 --> 00:43:27.285
Not yet.

484
00:43:29.079 --> 00:43:31.122
It's a new time, Sister.

485
00:43:31.206 --> 00:43:34.417
- What's new about it?
- Something inside of people is new.


486
00:43:34.501 --> 00:43:37.086
There is nothing new under the sun.

487
00:43:40.215 --> 00:43:42.425
The Church needs to change.

488
00:43:43.302 --> 00:43:46.262
We should sing a song
from the radio now and then,


489
00:43:46.346 --> 00:43:48.055
take the kids out for ice cream.

490
00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.348
Sweet tooth.

491
00:43:49.433 --> 00:43:52.435
And maybe take the boys
on a camping trip.


492
00:43:52.519 --> 00:43:54.187
The point being?

493
00:43:55.481 --> 00:43:57.523
We should be friendlier.

494
00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:00.109
You know, the children and the parents

495
00:44:00.194 --> 00:44:02.445
should see us
as members of their family.


496
00:44:02.529 --> 00:44:07.283
But we are not members of their family.
We're different.


497
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:12.371
- Why? Because of our vows?
- Precisely.


498
00:44:13.749 --> 00:44:16.083
I don't think we're so different.

499
00:44:16.168 --> 00:44:17.919
You know, Sister,
I would take some more tea.


500
00:44:18.003 --> 00:44:21.088
And they think we're different, yeah?

501
00:44:21.173 --> 00:44:22.799
The working...

502
00:44:22.883 --> 00:44:28.387
The working class people of this parish
trust us to be different.


503
00:44:28.472 --> 00:44:29.972
I think we're getting off the subject.

504
00:44:30.057 --> 00:44:31.724
Yes, you're right. You're right.
You're right. Back to it.


505
00:44:39.024 --> 00:44:40.358
Yes?

506
00:44:40.442 --> 00:44:42.610
Sister Raymond?

507
00:44:44.321 --> 00:44:48.366
Well, you tell her to wash her face
and her neck and report to me at 3:00.


508
00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:49.617
Yeah.

509
00:44:51.411 --> 00:44:54.872
Excuse me. The Christmas pageant.

510
00:44:55.916 --> 00:44:58.000
We must be careful

511
00:44:58.085 --> 00:44:59.585
how Donald Miller is used
in the pageant.


512
00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:02.880
- Easy there, Sister.
- Father.


513
00:45:08.595 --> 00:45:10.471
All right, what about Donald Miller?

514
00:45:10.556 --> 00:45:12.765
We must be careful, in the pageant,

515
00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:16.894
that we neither hide Donald Miller
nor put him forward.


516
00:45:20.232 --> 00:45:23.568
- Because of the color of his skin?
- That's right, yeah.


517
00:45:23.652 --> 00:45:27.238
- Why?
- Oh, come, Father.


518
00:45:27.322 --> 00:45:30.658
I think he should be treated
like every other boy.


519
00:45:31.702 --> 00:45:35.955
Well, you yourself singled the boy out
for special attention.


520
00:45:38.375 --> 00:45:43.921
You held a private meeting with him
at the rectory. A week ago?


521
00:45:44.006 --> 00:45:45.131
Yes.

522
00:45:49.011 --> 00:45:52.638
- What are we talking about?
- Donald Miller.


523
00:45:56.852 --> 00:46:00.187
The boy acted strangely
when he returned to class.


524
00:46:01.857 --> 00:46:03.065
He did?

525
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:06.652
When he returned from the rectory,
a little odd, yes.


526
00:46:07.321 --> 00:46:09.155
Can you tell us why?

527
00:46:11.366 --> 00:46:13.451
How did he act strangely?

528
00:46:14.161 --> 00:46:15.202
He...

529
00:46:16.455 --> 00:46:21.375
I'm not sure how to explain it.
He laid his head on the desk and...


530
00:46:25.464 --> 00:46:26.923
Do you mean
you had some impression?


531
00:46:27.007 --> 00:46:28.090
Yes.

532
00:46:28.175 --> 00:46:30.676
And he'd come from the rectory,
so you're asking me?


533
00:46:30.761 --> 00:46:32.136
Mmm. That's it.

534
00:46:38.727 --> 00:46:40.686
Did you want to discuss the pageant?
Is that why I'm here?


535
00:46:40.771 --> 00:46:42.688
Or is this what you wanted to discuss?

536
00:46:43.482 --> 00:46:44.649
This.

537
00:46:46.193 --> 00:46:49.153
Well, I'm a little uncomfortable.

538
00:46:49.237 --> 00:46:52.073
Why?
- Why do you think?


539
00:46:52.157 --> 00:46:54.492
The boy's well-being
is my responsibility.


540
00:46:56.411 --> 00:46:57.912
His well-being is not at issue.

541
00:46:57.996 --> 00:47:01.374
I'm not satisfied
that that is true.


542
00:47:01.458 --> 00:47:04.627
He was upset
when he returned to class.


543
00:47:05.295 --> 00:47:07.505
- Did he say something?
- No.


544
00:47:09.549 --> 00:47:11.217
What happened in the rectory?

545
00:47:12.636 --> 00:47:13.844
Happened?

546
00:47:15.097 --> 00:47:16.722
Nothing happened.
I had a talk with the boy.


547
00:47:16.807 --> 00:47:19.266
- What about?
- Private matter.


548
00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:22.436
He's 12 years old.
What could be private?


549
00:47:24.856 --> 00:47:26.691
- Should I get...
No.


550
00:47:28.151 --> 00:47:30.069
I object to your tone.

551
00:47:30.737 --> 00:47:36.742
This is not about my tone
or your tone, Father Flynn.


552
00:47:39.371 --> 00:47:42.456
- It's about arriving at the truth.
- Of what?


553
00:47:42.541 --> 00:47:48.421
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you?


554
00:47:48.505 --> 00:47:53.300
And you're controlling the expression
on your face right now, aren't you?


555
00:47:53.385 --> 00:47:54.760
My face?

556
00:47:57.347 --> 00:47:58.931
What exactly are you accusing me of?

557
00:47:59.016 --> 00:48:01.642
I'm not accusing you of anything,
Father Flynn.


558
00:48:01.727 --> 00:48:07.356
I am asking you to tell me
what happened in the rectory.


559
00:48:13.905 --> 00:48:16.282
I don't wish to continue this.

560
00:48:17.367 --> 00:48:18.701
And if you're dissatisfied with that,

561
00:48:18.785 --> 00:48:21.787
I suggest
you speak to Monsignor Benedict.


562
00:48:22.664 --> 00:48:27.251
I can only imagine this unfortunate
behavior is the result of overwork.


563
00:48:28.503 --> 00:48:31.464
Have a good morning, Sister. Sister.

564
00:48:36.511 --> 00:48:40.931
There was alcohol on his breath

565
00:48:42.893 --> 00:48:45.853
when he returned
from his meeting with you.


566
00:48:49.816 --> 00:48:51.108
Alcohol?

567
00:48:52.986 --> 00:48:55.279
I did smell it on his breath.

568
00:49:00.827 --> 00:49:01.994
Well?

569
00:49:06.291 --> 00:49:08.209
- Let this alone.
- No.


570
00:49:17.803 --> 00:49:21.305
Take your time, Father.
Would you like some more tea?


571
00:49:22.682 --> 00:49:24.850
You should've let it alone.

572
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:28.270
Not possible.

573
00:49:36.488 --> 00:49:39.615
Mr. McGuinn caught Donald
drinking altar wine.


574
00:49:41.451 --> 00:49:46.997
When I found out, I sent for him.
There were tears,


575
00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:52.878
and he begged not to be removed
from the altar boys. I took pity on him.


576
00:49:54.172 --> 00:49:57.508
I told him if no one else found out,
I'd let him stay on.


577
00:49:57.592 --> 00:50:01.428
What a relief. That explains everything.
Thanks be to God.


578
00:50:01.513 --> 00:50:04.515
Look, Sister, it was all a mistake.

579
00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.938
And if I talk to Mr. McGuinn?

580
00:50:11.022 --> 00:50:13.232
Talk to him, by all means.

581
00:50:13.316 --> 00:50:14.441
But now that the boy's secret's out,

582
00:50:14.526 --> 00:50:16.277
I'm gonna have to remove him
from the altar boys.


583
00:50:16.361 --> 00:50:17.820
That's what I was trying to avoid.

584
00:50:17.904 --> 00:50:19.405
You were trying
to protect the boy.


585
00:50:19.489 --> 00:50:21.365
That's right.

586
00:50:21.575 --> 00:50:23.993
I might have done the same thing.

587
00:50:24.077 --> 00:50:26.704
Is there a way Donald could stay
on the altar boys?


588
00:50:26.788 --> 00:50:30.833
If the boy drank altar wine,
he can't continue as an altar boy.


589
00:50:30.917 --> 00:50:32.334
Of course.

590
00:50:34.754 --> 00:50:36.589
Are you satisfied?

591
00:50:37.132 --> 00:50:38.299
Yes.

592
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:46.098
Well, I'll be going.
I have some writing to do.


593
00:50:47.434 --> 00:50:49.602
Intolerance.
- That's right.


594
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:55.191
I'm not pleased
with how you handled this.


595
00:50:56.067 --> 00:50:57.902
Sister. Sister.

596
00:51:06.661 --> 00:51:07.953
Well...

597
00:51:10.081 --> 00:51:12.750
What a relief. 
He cleared it all up.

598
00:51:15.754 --> 00:51:17.463
You believe him?

599
00:51:19.591 --> 00:51:21.008
Of course.

600
00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:26.138
Isn't it that it's easier to believe him?

601
00:51:26.389 --> 00:51:28.682
But we can corroborate his story
with Mr. McGuinn.


602
00:51:30.727 --> 00:51:31.894
Yes.

603
00:51:33.521 --> 00:51:36.065
These types of people are clever.

604
00:51:39.903 --> 00:51:42.905
- Well, I'm convinced.
- You're not.


605
00:51:43.406 --> 00:51:47.785
You just want things to be resolved
so you can have simplicity back.


606
00:51:49.037 --> 00:51:51.121
I want no further part of this.

607
00:51:52.624 --> 00:51:54.458
I'll bring him down.

608
00:51:56.127 --> 00:51:59.046
How can you be so sure
that he is lying?


609
00:52:02.926 --> 00:52:04.385
Experience.

610
00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:09.014
You just don't like him.

611
00:52:09.724 --> 00:52:13.102
You don't like it
that he uses a ballpoint pen.


612
00:52:13.186 --> 00:52:16.730
You don't like it that he takes
three lumps of sugar in his tea.


613
00:52:16.815 --> 00:52:18.983
You don't like it
that he likes Frosty the Snowman,


614
00:52:19.067 --> 00:52:23.862
and you are letting that convince you
of something terrible, just terrible.


615
00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:27.741
Well, I like Frosty the Snowman!

616
00:52:28.493 --> 00:52:30.786
And I think it would be nice
if this school weren't run like a jail,


617
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:33.205
and I think it's a good thing
that I love to teach history


618
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:35.416
and that I might inspire my students
to love it, too.


619
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:38.502
And if you judge that to mean
that I am not fit to be a teacher,


620
00:52:38.586 --> 00:52:40.129
then so be it!

621
00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.175
Sit down.

622
00:52:54.728 --> 00:52:57.980
Look at that. You blew out my light.

623
00:53:01.609 --> 00:53:06.864
In ancient Sparta, important matters
were decided by who shouted loudest.


624
00:53:06.948 --> 00:53:09.908
Fortunately,
we are not in ancient Sparta.


625
00:53:16.249 --> 00:53:18.208
You honestly find the students
in this school


626
00:53:18.293 --> 00:53:22.087
to be treated like inmates in a prison?

627
00:53:23.214 --> 00:53:24.381
No.

628
00:53:25.091 --> 00:53:30.220
Actually, they all seem fairly happy,
but they're all uniformly terrified of you.


629
00:53:31.973 --> 00:53:34.975
Yes. That's how it works.

630
00:53:36.561 --> 00:53:37.978
Sit there.

631
00:53:53.828 --> 00:53:55.788
Hello, this is Sister Aloysius Beauvier,

632
00:53:55.872 --> 00:53:59.500
principal at St. Nicholas School.
Is this Mrs. Miller?


633
00:54:01.628 --> 00:54:04.254
I'm calling about your son, Donald.

634
00:54:18.228 --> 00:54:22.398
A woman was gossiping with
a friend about a man she hardly knew.


635
00:54:23.066 --> 00:54:24.691
I know none of you
have ever done this.


636
00:54:26.736 --> 00:54:28.946
That night she had a dream.

637
00:54:29.614 --> 00:54:33.742
A great hand appeared over her
and pointed down at her.


638
00:54:35.537 --> 00:54:39.706
She was immediately seized
with an overwhelming sense of guilt


639
00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:43.335
The next day she went to confession.

640
00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:46.338
She got the old parish prist,
Father O'Rourke.


641
00:54:47.549 --> 00:54:49.883
She told him the whole thing.

642
00:54:50.385 --> 00:54:54.096
"Is gossiping a sin?"
She asked the old man.


643
00:54:55.265 --> 00:54:59.393
"Was that the hand of God Almighty
pointing a finger at me?


644
00:54:59.477 --> 00:55:02.146
"Should I be
asking your absolution, Father?


645
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:05.274
"Tell me,
have I done something wrong?"


646
00:55:06.067 --> 00:55:09.611
"Yes. " Father O'
Rourke answered her.

647
00:55:09.696 --> 00:55:13.699
"Yes, you ignorant,
badly brought up female.


648
00:55:14.784 --> 00:55:17.661
"You have borne false witness
against your neighbor.


649
00:55:17.745 --> 00:55:20.664
"You have played fast and loose
with his reputation,


650
00:55:20.748 --> 00:55:23.417
"and you should be heartily ashamed!"

651
00:55:25.128 --> 00:55:30.007
So the woman said she was sorry
and asked for forgiveness.


652
00:55:30.884 --> 00:55:33.760
"Not so fast," says O'Rourke.

653
00:55:34.512 --> 00:55:39.099
"I want you to go home.
Take a pillow up on your roof,


654
00:55:39.184 --> 00:55:42.978
"cut it open with a knife,
and retum here to me. "


655
00:55:45.023 --> 00:55:48.484
So the woman went home,
took a pillow off her bed,


656
00:55:49.027 --> 00:55:50.569
a knife from the drawer,

657
00:55:50.653 --> 00:55:54.698
went up the fire escape to her roof
and stabbed the pillow.


658
00:55:54.782 --> 00:55:58.243
Then she went back
to the old parish priest as instructed.


659
00:55:58.328 --> 00:56:02.414
"Did you gut the pillow with a knife?"
He says.


660
00:56:02.499 --> 00:56:06.001
"Yes, Father. "
"And what was the result?"


661
00:56:07.462 --> 00:56:09.963
"Feathers," she said.

662
00:56:13.968 --> 00:56:16.094
"Feathers," he repeated.

663
00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:21.767
"Feathers everywhere, Father. "

664
00:56:24.646 --> 00:56:27.648
"Now, I want you to go back

665
00:56:27.732 --> 00:56:31.652
"and gather up every last feather
that flew out on the wind. "


666
00:56:32.612 --> 00:56:36.698
"Well," she said, "it can't be done.

667
00:56:37.784 --> 00:56:41.620
"I don't know where they went.
The wind took them all over. "


668
00:56:43.456 --> 00:56:47.876
"And that," said Father O'Rourke,
"is gossip!"


669
00:56:50.463 --> 00:56:54.466
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.


670
00:56:58.888 --> 00:57:00.389
Please rise.

671
00:57:32.505 --> 00:57:35.173
What's that bird complaining about?

672
00:57:37.427 --> 00:57:39.595
What kind of bird is that?

673
00:57:39.679 --> 00:57:42.598
That a starling? A grackle?

674
00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:48.395
- A crow.
- Course it is.


675
00:57:49.856 --> 00:57:51.982
Are you praying?
I didn't mean to interrupt.


676
00:57:52.066 --> 00:57:53.942
I'm not praying. No.

677
00:57:55.903 --> 00:57:57.654
You seem subdued.

678
00:57:58.906 --> 00:58:01.700
Oh, I can't sleep.

679
00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:04.244
Why not?

680
00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:07.581
Bad dreams.

681
00:58:07.999 --> 00:58:10.459
Yeah, I can't sleep on occasion.

682
00:58:11.502 --> 00:58:15.172
Why? Do you see that big hand
pointing a finger at you?


683
00:58:15.548 --> 00:58:17.174
Yes. Sometimes.

684
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:23.805
Was your sermon
directed at anyone in particular?


685
00:58:25.016 --> 00:58:26.808
What do you think?

686
00:58:38.613 --> 00:58:43.075
I received a letter
from my brother in Marlyand.


687
00:58:44.077 --> 00:58:45.702
He's very sick.

688
00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:49.956
Then maybe you should go
and see him.


689
00:58:50.041 --> 00:58:52.084
I can't leave my class.

690
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:02.552
Is it true?

691
00:59:04.639 --> 00:59:05.847
What?

692
00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:09.476
You know what I'm asking.

693
00:59:11.646 --> 00:59:12.771
No.

694
00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:19.486
I saw you put an undershirt
in Donald Miller's locker.


695
00:59:21.864 --> 00:59:25.826
- He left it in the sacristy.
- Why didn't you hand it to him?


696
00:59:29.455 --> 00:59:32.624
I'm trying to spare him
further embarrassment.


697
00:59:48.433 --> 00:59:51.560
It's me that cares about that child,
not her.


698
00:59:52.979 --> 00:59:55.439
Has she ever reached out a hand?

699
00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.944
That black boy needs help
or he's not gonna make it.


700
01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.155
If she has her way,
he'll be left to his own undoing.


701
01:00:03.239 --> 01:00:06.783
Why do you think he drank the wine?
He's in trouble.


702
01:00:10.037 --> 01:00:12.289
And she sees me talk
in a human way to these kids


703
01:00:12.373 --> 01:00:16.668
and she immediately assumes that
there must be something wrong with it.


704
01:00:17.336 --> 01:00:20.672
Well, I'm not gonna let her
keep this parish in the Dark Ages,


705
01:00:20.757 --> 01:00:24.301
and I'm not gonna let her
destroy my spirit of compassion.


706
01:00:24.385 --> 01:00:25.927
I'm sure that's not her intent.

707
01:00:26.012 --> 01:00:29.806
- That I care about this congregation.
- I know you do.


708
01:00:29.891 --> 01:00:34.561
Like you care about your class.
You love them, don't you?


709
01:00:36.105 --> 01:00:38.231
- Yes.
- And that's natural.


710
01:00:38.941 --> 01:00:41.693
How else would you relate to children?

711
01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:48.158
Now, I can look at your face
and know your philosophy.


712
01:00:48.618 --> 01:00:50.202
It's kindness.

713
01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:54.164
I don't know. I mean, of course.

714
01:00:56.375 --> 01:00:59.878
There are people
who go after your humanity, Sister,


715
01:01:00.671 --> 01:01:03.089
that tell you that
the light in your heart is a weakness.


716
01:01:03.174 --> 01:01:04.925
Don't believe it.

717
01:01:06.135 --> 01:01:11.139
It's an old tactic of cruel people
to kill kindness in the name of virtue.


718
01:01:13.518 --> 01:01:15.977
There's nothing wrong with love.

719
01:01:18.689 --> 01:01:19.898
Love?

720
01:01:21.776 --> 01:01:24.903
Have you forgotten the message
of our Savior?


721
01:01:24.987 --> 01:01:28.240
It's love of people.

722
01:01:37.625 --> 01:01:40.669
I just feel
as if everything is upside down.


723
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:49.845
There are just times in life
when we feel lost. It happens.


724
01:01:52.765 --> 01:01:54.474
And it's a bond.

725
01:01:59.730 --> 01:02:01.606
- Flowers.
- Yeah.


726
01:02:02.066 --> 01:02:04.109
To remind me of spring.

727
01:02:13.536 --> 01:02:15.328
I should be going.

728
01:02:18.416 --> 01:02:20.750
I'm sorry your brother's ill.

729
01:02:22.545 --> 01:02:24.337
Thank you, Father.

730
01:02:30.344 --> 01:02:32.178
I don't believe it.

731
01:02:34.223 --> 01:02:35.640
You don't?

732
01:02:37.810 --> 01:02:38.935
No.

733
01:02:40.438 --> 01:02:43.231
Thank you, Sister.
Thank you very much.


734
01:02:54.702 --> 01:02:56.286
Hey, Anthony!
That's not funny.


735
01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:58.747
That's also the day
that I tripped. I broke my ankle.


736
01:02:58.831 --> 01:02:59.956
I barely...

737
01:03:00.041 --> 01:03:03.335
Father. I think
I've just gotta tell somebody.


738
01:03:03.419 --> 01:03:05.712
- Hello, Noreen.
- I'm in love.


739
01:03:06.672 --> 01:03:08.798
That's wonderful. 
Who's the lucky boy?

740
01:03:08.883 --> 01:03:11.426
- Jimmy Hurley.
- Have you told him?


741
01:03:11.844 --> 01:03:13.678
For life and death,
I'd go for waffles.


742
01:03:13.763 --> 01:03:15.513
Maybe you should.

743
01:03:16.474 --> 01:03:18.016
Maybe I will, Father.

744
01:03:19.602 --> 01:03:20.810
Jimmy!

745
01:03:21.562 --> 01:03:23.104
Jimmy Hurley?

746
01:03:24.732 --> 01:03:26.358
Come over here!

747
01:03:29.278 --> 01:03:30.987
Hurry up, already!

748
01:03:31.364 --> 01:03:32.989
Father Sherman.

749
01:03:34.492 --> 01:03:36.701
Jimmy,
I just gotta tell you something.


750
01:03:42.917 --> 01:03:44.167
You dropped something.

751
01:03:45.378 --> 01:03:46.544
It's not funny.

752
01:03:46.629 --> 01:03:47.837
Get out of the way.

753
01:04:02.019 --> 01:04:03.645
It's all right.

754
01:04:04.605 --> 01:04:07.399
He doesn't like me.
That is so easy!


755
01:04:11.237 --> 01:04:13.822
My parents are gonna be
so angry at me.


756
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:24.541
Okay. Be quiet.

757
01:04:27.586 --> 01:04:29.546
I said be quiet!

758
01:04:31.257 --> 01:04:34.884
The next one of you that speaks out
of turn gets sent right to the principal.


759
01:04:34.969 --> 01:04:36.886
Now the question was,

760
01:04:37.596 --> 01:04:40.473
what was
Patrick Henry's famous remark?


761
01:04:44.645 --> 01:04:46.604
- Donald.
- Sister?


762
01:04:51.777 --> 01:04:53.570
What was the question?

763
01:04:55.031 --> 01:04:58.033
Nobody help him.
Jimmy, put your hand down.


764
01:04:58.909 --> 01:05:00.994
Donald Miller, stand up.

765
01:05:06.417 --> 01:05:10.045
- What was the question, Donald?
- I don't know, Sister.


766
01:05:11.547 --> 01:05:13.965
It means you weren't listening.

767
01:05:14.383 --> 01:05:15.925
Yes, Sister.

768
01:05:16.594 --> 01:05:20.388
The question was, what was
Patrick Henry's famous remark?


769
01:05:24.477 --> 01:05:25.935
I don't know.

770
01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:27.437
"Give me liberty or give me death!"

771
01:05:27.521 --> 01:05:30.315
James Hurley,
down to the principal's office.


772
01:05:30.399 --> 01:05:31.566
Now!

773
01:05:55.758 --> 01:05:57.926
- Mrs. Miller?
- Yes.


774
01:05:58.010 --> 01:05:59.344
Come in.

775
01:06:01.263 --> 01:06:03.139
Please, have a seat.

776
01:06:07.186 --> 01:06:09.729
I was changing a bulb.

777
01:06:10.439 --> 01:06:13.358
Thought I might had the wrong day.
You didn't answer.


778
01:06:14.485 --> 01:06:17.821
Oh, well, just between us,

779
01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:23.034
I was listening to a transistor radio
with an earpiece.


780
01:06:23.119 --> 01:06:25.370
Look how tiny they're making them.

781
01:06:25.454 --> 01:06:27.539
I confiscated it
from one of the students,


782
01:06:27.623 --> 01:06:29.374
now I can't stop listening to it.

783
01:06:30.251 --> 01:06:31.876
You like music?

784
01:06:34.004 --> 01:06:36.172
No. News reports.

785
01:06:36.715 --> 01:06:39.217
Years ago I used to listen
to all the news reports,


786
01:06:39.301 --> 01:06:42.428
because my husband was in Italy,
in the war.


787
01:06:42.513 --> 01:06:45.390
- You were a married woman?
- Yes.


788
01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:48.393
But then he was killed.

789
01:06:49.812 --> 01:06:51.062
Is your husband coming?

790
01:06:51.147 --> 01:06:53.815
Couldn't get off work.
I only have half an hour myself.


791
01:06:53.899 --> 01:06:56.943
I see. Of course. 
It was a lot to ask.

792
01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:08.246
How's Donald doing?

793
01:07:09.039 --> 01:07:12.292
He's passing his subjects.
He has average grades.


794
01:07:12.376 --> 01:07:14.836
Oh. Good.

795
01:07:15.546 --> 01:07:18.131
He was upset about getting taken off
the altar boys.


796
01:07:18.215 --> 01:07:20.466
Mmm. Did he explain why?

797
01:07:20.551 --> 01:07:23.428
He said he was caught
drinking altar wine.


798
01:07:23.512 --> 01:07:25.388
That is the reason.

799
01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:28.600
Well, that seems fair.

800
01:07:30.102 --> 01:07:31.978
But he's a good boy, Sister.
He fell down there,


801
01:07:32.062 --> 01:07:34.772
but he's a good boy
pretty much down the line.


802
01:07:34.857 --> 01:07:36.649
How is he at home?

803
01:07:38.444 --> 01:07:40.778
His father beat the hell out of him
over that wine.


804
01:07:40.863 --> 01:07:42.280
Oh, he shouldn't do that.

805
01:07:42.364 --> 01:07:46.201
You don't tell my husband what to do.
You just stand back.


806
01:07:47.036 --> 01:07:50.038
My husband didn't want Donald
to come here.


807
01:07:50.539 --> 01:07:52.290
- Why?
- He thought he'd have trouble


808
01:07:52.374 --> 01:07:55.668
with the other boys,
but that hasn't really happened.


809
01:07:55.753 --> 01:07:57.003
Good.

810
01:07:57.379 --> 01:08:00.924
That priest, Father Flynn,
been watching out for him.


811
01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:04.427
Yes.

812
01:08:11.685 --> 01:08:13.186
Excuse me.

813
01:08:22.238 --> 01:08:24.280
James Hurley,
what are you doing out of class?


814
01:08:24.365 --> 01:08:26.407
- Sister James sent me down.
- What for?


815
01:08:26.492 --> 01:08:29.369
- Talking.
- Well, go back up and shut up!


816
01:08:30.704 --> 01:08:31.996
Go! Go!

817
01:08:36.418 --> 01:08:38.127
What's going on?

818
01:08:42.925 --> 01:08:46.386
None of your business.
Now go on. Go back to class.


819
01:08:47.263 --> 01:08:48.721
Bullshit.

820
01:08:48.806 --> 01:08:50.974
- What'd you say?
- Nothing!


821
01:08:57.773 --> 01:09:00.483
You have 20 minutes, you say?

822
01:09:00.567 --> 01:09:03.361
It's just that I
have to walk to work.

823
01:09:03.445 --> 01:09:05.863
- Where is work?
- Parkchester.


824
01:09:05.948 --> 01:09:09.325
If I don't start cleaning by noon,
I'm not home to let Donald in.


825
01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:12.620
- May I walk with you?
- I don't mind.


826
01:09:15.708 --> 01:09:17.625
Eight sixty-fourths.

827
01:09:18.627 --> 01:09:21.838
Who can tell me
what the common denominator is?


828
01:09:21.922 --> 01:09:23.214
Nobody

829
01:09:25.134 --> 01:09:27.385
Back already, Mr. Hurley?

830
01:09:28.053 --> 01:09:31.514
- I said, back already, Mr. Hurley?
- Leave me alone!


831
01:09:32.057 --> 01:09:34.350
Who do you think you're talking to?

832
01:09:34.435 --> 01:09:37.937
This is my classroom, boy!
Don't you forget that.


833
01:09:42.234 --> 01:09:43.651
I'm sorry.

834
01:09:50.159 --> 01:09:52.869
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

835
01:09:56.665 --> 01:09:58.833
Have you met
Father Flynn?


836
01:09:59.043 --> 01:10:01.419
Just seen him on the altar.
Haven't met him face to face.


837
01:10:01.503 --> 01:10:03.963
No, just, you know, heard from Donald.

838
01:10:04.048 --> 01:10:05.423
And what does he say?

839
01:10:05.507 --> 01:10:08.176
You know,
"Father Flynn, Father Flynn. "


840
01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:11.012
He looks up to him. Man gives him
his time, which is what the boy needs.


841
01:10:11.096 --> 01:10:12.680
He needs that.

842
01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:15.933
Mrs. Miller, we may have a problem.

843
01:10:17.186 --> 01:10:19.103
I thought there must a been a reason
you wanting to see me.


844
01:10:19.188 --> 01:10:21.147
Principal's a big job.

845
01:10:21.982 --> 01:10:25.234
I just want to say though,
it's just till June.


846
01:10:25.319 --> 01:10:26.736
Excuse me?

847
01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:32.325
Whatever the problem is,
Donald just has to make it till June.


848
01:10:32.409 --> 01:10:34.786
Then he's off into high school.

849
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:36.120
Right.

850
01:10:36.705 --> 01:10:38.581
If Donald can graduate
from St. Nicholas,


851
01:10:38.665 --> 01:10:41.459
he has a better chance
of getting into a good high school,


852
01:10:41.543 --> 01:10:44.712
and that would mean
an opportunity at college.


853
01:10:45.672 --> 01:10:47.423
I don't see anything at this time

854
01:10:47.508 --> 01:10:51.052
standing in the way
of his graduating with his class.


855
01:10:52.096 --> 01:10:55.264
- Well, that's all I care about.
- I doubt that.


856
01:10:55.808 --> 01:10:57.100
Try me.

857
01:10:59.853 --> 01:11:04.690
I am concerned about the relationship
between Father Flynn and your son.


858
01:11:04.775 --> 01:11:08.403
You don't say. Concerned.
What do you mean, concerned?


859
01:11:08.487 --> 01:11:10.613
That it may not be right.

860
01:11:12.157 --> 01:11:13.783
Well, there's something wrong
with everbody,


861
01:11:13.867 --> 01:11:17.412
and their soul gotta be forgiven.
I work right there.


862
01:11:17.746 --> 01:11:20.706
I am concerned, to be frank,

863
01:11:24.044 --> 01:11:27.880
that Father Flynn may have made
advances on your son.


864
01:11:32.136 --> 01:11:33.719
May have made?

865
01:11:34.513 --> 01:11:36.264
I can't be certain.

866
01:11:36.348 --> 01:11:38.182
- No evidence?
- No.


867
01:11:39.309 --> 01:11:41.853
Then maybe there's nothing to it.

868
01:11:49.319 --> 01:11:51.863
I think there is something to it.

869
01:11:52.531 --> 01:11:55.241
I think Father Flynn
gave Donald that altar wine.


870
01:11:55.325 --> 01:11:57.243
Why would he do that?

871
01:12:00.539 --> 01:12:03.791
- Has Donald been acting strangely?
- No.


872
01:12:03.876 --> 01:12:06.335
- Nothing out of the ordinary?
- He's been himself.


873
01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:09.172
- All right.
- Look, Sister, I don't want any trouble.


874
01:12:09.256 --> 01:12:11.549
I don't... I'm not sure
you completely understand.


875
01:12:11.633 --> 01:12:13.593
I think I understand
the kind of thing you're talking about,


876
01:12:13.677 --> 01:12:16.304
but I don't want to get into it.

877
01:12:16.388 --> 01:12:17.889
What's that?

878
01:12:20.184 --> 01:12:22.894
Look, I only have a few minutes.
Not to be disagreeing,


879
01:12:22.978 --> 01:12:25.813
but if we're talking about
something floating around


880
01:12:25.898 --> 01:12:28.316
between this priest and my son,
it ain't my son's fault.


881
01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.985
- I'm not suggesting that...
- He's just a boy.


882
01:12:31.069 --> 01:12:32.320
- I know.
- Twelve years old.


883
01:12:32.404 --> 01:12:34.030
If someone should be taking blame,
it should be the man...


884
01:12:34.114 --> 01:12:36.157
- I know. I agree with you completely.
... not the boy.


885
01:12:36.241 --> 01:12:37.533
You're agreeing with me,
but I got called


886
01:12:37.618 --> 01:12:38.784
to the principal,
if you know what I'm saying.


887
01:12:38.869 --> 01:12:42.288
I am concerned about Donald's welfare.

888
01:12:44.416 --> 01:12:46.542
You honestly think that priest
gave Donald that wine to drink?


889
01:12:46.627 --> 01:12:48.002
Yes, I do.

890
01:12:48.086 --> 01:12:50.505
Then how come my son
got kicked off the altar boys


891
01:12:50.589 --> 01:12:52.673
- if it was a man that gave it to him?
- I know.


892
01:12:52.758 --> 01:12:55.343
The boy got caught, the man didn't.

893
01:12:58.013 --> 01:12:59.430
- So you're giving my son the blame.
- No.


894
01:12:59.515 --> 01:13:00.515
No problem my son getting blamed,

895
01:13:00.599 --> 01:13:02.517
- and you know why that is.
- Perhaps you should let me talk.


896
01:13:02.601 --> 01:13:04.769
- I think you're getting upset.
- Sister, you ain't going against


897
01:13:04.853 --> 01:13:06.145
no man in a robe and win.
He's got the position.


898
01:13:06.271 --> 01:13:09.440
- And he's got your son.
- Let him have him then.


899
01:13:11.818 --> 01:13:13.027
What?

900
01:13:15.197 --> 01:13:17.114
It's just till June.

901
01:13:19.284 --> 01:13:21.661
Do you know what you're saying?

902
01:13:22.663 --> 01:13:24.956
Know more about it than you.

903
01:13:26.792 --> 01:13:30.211
I believe this man is creating,

904
01:13:30.295 --> 01:13:32.463
or may have already brought about,

905
01:13:32.548 --> 01:13:34.966
an improper relationship with your son.

906
01:13:35.050 --> 01:13:36.551
I don't know.

907
01:13:36.969 --> 01:13:38.469
I know I am right.

908
01:13:38.554 --> 01:13:42.640
Why you gotta know something
like that for sure when you don't?


909
01:13:43.725 --> 01:13:46.018
What kind of mother are you?

910
01:13:49.731 --> 01:13:52.733
Excuse me, but you don't know enough
about life to say a thing like that, Sister.


911
01:13:52.818 --> 01:13:53.901
I know enough.

912
01:13:53.986 --> 01:13:55.903
You know the rules maybe,
but that don't cover it.


913
01:13:55.988 --> 01:13:57.863
I know what I won't accept.

914
01:13:57.990 --> 01:14:00.074
You accept what you gotta accept,
and you work with it.


915
01:14:00.158 --> 01:14:01.325
This man is in my school.

916
01:14:01.410 --> 01:14:02.493
Well, he's gotta be somewhere and

917
01:14:02.578 --> 01:14:04.245
- maybe he's doing some good, too.
- He is after the boys!


918
01:14:04.329 --> 01:14:07.665
Well, maybe some of them boys
want to get caught!


919
01:14:19.678 --> 01:14:22.096
That's why his father beat him.

920
01:14:25.726 --> 01:14:27.268
Not the wine.

921
01:14:35.527 --> 01:14:37.570
What are you telling me?

922
01:14:41.867 --> 01:14:44.702
I'm talking about the boy's nature now,

923
01:14:46.079 --> 01:14:48.122
not anything he's done.

924
01:14:49.875 --> 01:14:54.045
You can't hold a child responsible
for what God gave him to be.


925
01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:59.717
I'm only interested in actions,
Mrs. Miller.


926
01:14:59.801 --> 01:15:01.719
But then there's the boy's nature.

927
01:15:01.803 --> 01:15:04.889
- Leave that out of it.
- Well, forget it then.


928
01:15:06.308 --> 01:15:09.393
You're the one
forcing people to say things.


929
01:15:12.939 --> 01:15:14.148
My boy came to your school

930
01:15:14.232 --> 01:15:17.818
'cause they were gonna kill him
in the public school.


931
01:15:20.447 --> 01:15:22.615
His father don't like him.

932
01:15:23.158 --> 01:15:26.243
He come to your school,
kids don't like him.


933
01:15:26.953 --> 01:15:29.622
One man is good to him, this priest.

934
01:15:30.499 --> 01:15:33.292
Then does a man
have his reasons, yes.


935
01:15:34.419 --> 01:15:37.588
Everbody does.
You have your reasons,


936
01:15:38.799 --> 01:15:41.926
but do I ask the man
why he's good to my son?


937
01:15:43.929 --> 01:15:45.096
No.

938
01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:50.601
I don't care why.

939
01:15:54.106 --> 01:15:58.859
My son needs some man
to care about him


940
01:16:00.112 --> 01:16:03.322
and to see him through
to where he wants to go.


941
01:16:03.782 --> 01:16:05.658
And thank God this educated man

942
01:16:05.784 --> 01:16:08.786
with some kindness in him
wants to do just that.


943
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:11.539
- This will not do.
- It's just till June.


944
01:16:11.623 --> 01:16:13.666
I'll throw your son out of this school.

945
01:16:13.792 --> 01:16:15.960
And why would you do that
if it didn't start with him?


946
01:16:16.044 --> 01:16:18.379
Because I will stop this.

947
01:16:18.463 --> 01:16:20.297
You'd hurt my son to get your way?

948
01:16:20.382 --> 01:16:23.300
- It won't end with your son.
- Throw the priest out then.


949
01:16:23.385 --> 01:16:27.471
- I am trying to do just that.
- Then what do you want from me?


950
01:16:35.147 --> 01:16:36.480
Nothing.

951
01:16:40.819 --> 01:16:42.486
As it turns out.

952
01:16:43.572 --> 01:16:46.490
Please leave my son
out of this.


953
01:16:54.499 --> 01:16:58.169
My husband will kill that child
over a thing like this.


954
01:17:07.763 --> 01:17:09.180
I will try.

955
01:17:19.191 --> 01:17:20.566
I'm late.

956
01:17:23.278 --> 01:17:24.570
Sister,

957
01:17:27.407 --> 01:17:30.451
I don't know if you and me
on the same side.


958
01:17:31.411 --> 01:17:35.581
I'll be standing with my son
and those who are good with my son.


959
01:17:36.041 --> 01:17:39.585
It'd be nice to see you there.
Good morning.


960
01:18:58.623 --> 01:19:00.165
May I come in?

961
01:19:00.834 --> 01:19:02.543
A third party would be required.

962
01:19:02.627 --> 01:19:05.629
Yeah. What was Donald's mother
doing here?


963
01:19:06.298 --> 01:19:08.799
- We were having a chat.
- About what?


964
01:19:08.884 --> 01:19:10.384
A third party
would truly be required, Father.


965
01:19:10.468 --> 01:19:12.303
No, Sister. No third party!

966
01:19:12.387 --> 01:19:15.055
Me and you are due for a talk!

967
01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:17.641
You have to stop
this campaign against me.


968
01:19:17.726 --> 01:19:20.644
- You can stop it at any time.
- How?


969
01:19:20.729 --> 01:19:21.896
Confess and resign.

970
01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:24.315
You are attempting
to destroy my reputation!


971
01:19:24.399 --> 01:19:27.651
Who keeps opening my window?

972
01:19:29.195 --> 01:19:31.071
What are you doing in this school?

973
01:19:31.156 --> 01:19:33.073
I'm trying to do good.

974
01:19:33.533 --> 01:19:35.659
Even more to the point,

975
01:19:35.744 --> 01:19:38.704
what are you doing in the prieasthood?

976
01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:43.042
You are single-handedly holding
this school and this parish back.


977
01:19:43.335 --> 01:19:45.252
- From what?
- Progressive education


978
01:19:45.337 --> 01:19:46.545
and a welcoming church.

979
01:19:46.671 --> 01:19:48.839
You can't distract me, Father.

980
01:19:48.924 --> 01:19:50.382
This is not about my behavior,
it's about yours.


981
01:19:50.508 --> 01:19:52.509
No, this is about
your unfounded suspicions.


982
01:19:52.594 --> 01:19:55.846
- That's right. I have suspicions.
- Just leave that. It's not important.


983
01:19:55.931 --> 01:19:57.890
I will decide

984
01:20:00.852 --> 01:20:02.853
what's important.

985
01:20:02.938 --> 01:20:05.689
Why do you suspect me?
What have I done?


986
01:20:07.275 --> 01:20:11.028
You gave that boy wine,
and you let him take the blame.


987
01:20:11.112 --> 01:20:14.073
That's completely untrue.
Did you talk to Mr. McGuinn?


988
01:20:14.199 --> 01:20:16.575
All McGuinn knows
is that the boy drank wine.


989
01:20:16.701 --> 01:20:18.869
He doesn't know
how he came to drink it.


990
01:20:18.954 --> 01:20:21.205
Did his mother
have something to add to that?


991
01:20:21.289 --> 01:20:22.414
No.

992
01:20:23.375 --> 01:20:27.044
- So that's it.
- I am not satisfied.


993
01:20:27.128 --> 01:20:28.921
Ask the boy then.

994
01:20:29.464 --> 01:20:32.216
- He'd protect you.
- Why would he do that?


995
01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:36.220
- Because you have seduced him.
- You're insane.


996
01:20:36.304 --> 01:20:38.806
You've got it in your head
that I corrupted this child


997
01:20:38.890 --> 01:20:41.976
after giving him wine,
and nothing I say will change that.


998
01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:43.310
That's right.

999
01:20:43.395 --> 01:20:44.979
But this has nothing to do
with the wine.


1000
01:20:45.063 --> 01:20:48.273
Not really. You've had a fundamental
mistrust of me before this incident.


1001
01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:52.236
It was you that warned Sister James
to be on the lookout, wasn't it?


1002
01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.570
That's true.

1003
01:20:53.655 --> 01:20:55.906
- So you admit it!
- Certainly.


1004
01:20:57.492 --> 01:20:58.659
Why?

1005
01:21:00.954 --> 01:21:02.579
I know people.

1006
01:21:03.957 --> 01:21:05.457
That's not good enough.

1007
01:21:05.583 --> 01:21:08.419
- It won't have to be.
- How's that?


1008
01:21:08.503 --> 01:21:11.130
You will tell me what you have done.

1009
01:21:12.716 --> 01:21:14.508
Oh, I will.

1010
01:21:16.511 --> 01:21:17.928
Out again.

1011
01:21:19.431 --> 01:21:22.266
Sister James is convinced I'm innocent.

1012
01:21:22.475 --> 01:21:24.852
So you talked to Sister James.

1013
01:21:25.854 --> 01:21:28.105
Well, of course
you talked to Sister James.


1014
01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:30.274
Did you know
Donald's father beats him?


1015
01:21:30.358 --> 01:21:31.525
Yes.

1016
01:21:31.776 --> 01:21:34.778
And might that not account
for the odd behavior


1017
01:21:34.863 --> 01:21:37.656
Sister James noticed in the boy?

1018
01:21:37.824 --> 01:21:39.283
It might.

1019
01:21:39.451 --> 01:21:41.326
Then what is it? What?

1020
01:21:42.162 --> 01:21:44.455
What did you hear?

1021
01:21:44.539 --> 01:21:47.875
What did you see
that convinced you so thoroughly?


1022
01:21:49.461 --> 01:21:51.295
What does it matter?

1023
01:21:52.172 --> 01:21:56.508
It matters! What does it matter?
I want to know!


1024
01:22:08.313 --> 01:22:10.314
Out this window,

1025
01:22:10.732 --> 01:22:15.235
I saw you grab William London's wrist,

1026
01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:19.198
and I saw him pull away.

1027
01:22:34.964 --> 01:22:37.091
- Are you serious?
- I am.


1028
01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:40.302
That's all?

1029
01:22:40.929 --> 01:22:43.764
Yeah. That was all.

1030
01:22:47.435 --> 01:22:49.061
That's nothing.

1031
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:54.399
- What are you doing now?
- I'm writing down what you say.


1032
01:22:54.484 --> 01:22:59.113
It might be important when I have
to explain why you have to be removed.


1033
01:23:04.577 --> 01:23:08.122
This morning before I spoke
with Mrs. Miller,


1034
01:23:08.206 --> 01:23:11.625
I took the precaution
of calling your last parish.


1035
01:23:12.335 --> 01:23:14.044
What did he say?

1036
01:23:14.879 --> 01:23:16.672
- Who?
- The pastor.


1037
01:23:18.758 --> 01:23:22.344
I did not speak to the pastor.
I spoke to a nun.


1038
01:23:23.304 --> 01:23:26.056
You should have spoken to the pastor.

1039
01:23:27.142 --> 01:23:28.433
I spoke to a nun.

1040
01:23:28.518 --> 01:23:30.978
You know that's not the proper route
for you to have taken, Sister.


1041
01:23:31.062 --> 01:23:33.981
The church is very clear. You're
supposed to go through the pastor.


1042
01:23:34.065 --> 01:23:36.984
Why? You have an understanding,
you and he?


1043
01:23:37.068 --> 01:23:40.112
No, you have no right to go rummaging
through my past!


1044
01:23:40.196 --> 01:23:42.030
You have a history.

1045
01:23:42.115 --> 01:23:44.825
This is your third parish in five years.

1046
01:23:44.909 --> 01:23:46.326
- Why?
- Call the pastor.


1047
01:23:46.494 --> 01:23:49.163
Ask him why I left.
It's perfectly innocent.


1048
01:23:49.247 --> 01:23:52.082
- I'm not calling the pastor.
- I'm a good priest.


1049
01:23:52.167 --> 01:23:55.252
Go after another child and
another child, until you are stopped.


1050
01:23:55.336 --> 01:23:57.838
- What nun did you speak to?
- I won't say.


1051
01:23:57.922 --> 01:24:00.924
- Yeah, I've not touched a child.
- You have!


1052
01:24:01.467 --> 01:24:03.844
You haven't the slightest proof
of anything.


1053
01:24:03.928 --> 01:24:05.637
But I have my certainty.

1054
01:24:05.722 --> 01:24:07.848
And armed with that,
I'll go to your last parish


1055
01:24:07.932 --> 01:24:10.976
and the one before that.
If necessary, I'll find a parent.


1056
01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:13.520
Trust me, Father Flynn, I will.

1057
01:24:14.522 --> 01:24:17.566
You have no right
to act on your own!

1058
01:24:18.318 --> 01:24:22.529
You have taken vows,
obeience being one!


1059
01:24:22.614 --> 01:24:24.448
You answer to us!

1060
01:24:24.532 --> 01:24:27.576
You have no right
to step outside the church!


1061
01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:31.246
I will step outside the church
if that's what needs to be done,


1062
01:24:31.331 --> 01:24:33.123
though the door should shut
behind me!


1063
01:24:33.208 --> 01:24:38.128
I will do what needs to be done,
though I'm damned to hell!


1064
01:24:38.338 --> 01:24:42.758
You should understand that,
or you will mistake me.


1065
01:24:45.845 --> 01:24:49.014
Now, did you give Donald Miller
wine to drink?


1066
01:24:50.308 --> 01:24:52.935
Have you never done anything wrong?

1067
01:24:53.478 --> 01:24:55.771
- I have.
- No mortal sin?


1068
01:25:05.323 --> 01:25:06.490
Yes.

1069
01:25:08.493 --> 01:25:09.660
And?

1070
01:25:12.413 --> 01:25:16.124
I confessed it, Father.

1071
01:25:18.836 --> 01:25:21.004
Then whatever I have done,

1072
01:25:21.631 --> 01:25:25.008
I have left in the healing hands
of my confessor.


1073
01:25:26.302 --> 01:25:27.803
As have you.

1074
01:25:29.305 --> 01:25:31.014
We are the same.

1075
01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:41.608
No, we are not. 
We are not the same.

1076
01:25:52.036 --> 01:25:54.913
A dog that bites
is a dog that bites.

1077
01:25:57.208 --> 01:26:00.168
Did you give Donald Miller
wine to drink?


1078
01:26:01.337 --> 01:26:02.421
No.

1079
01:26:04.007 --> 01:26:05.924
Mental reservations?

1080
01:26:07.135 --> 01:26:08.260
No.

1081
01:26:11.389 --> 01:26:12.723
You lie.

1082
01:26:16.352 --> 01:26:17.978
Very well then.

1083
01:26:20.481 --> 01:26:24.693
If you will not
leave my office, I will.

1084
01:26:28.156 --> 01:26:31.074
And once I go, 
I will not stop.

1085
01:26:37.206 --> 01:26:38.415
Wait.

1086
01:27:05.109 --> 01:27:07.944
I can't say everything, you understand?

1087
01:27:09.822 --> 01:27:12.074
There's things I can't say,

1088
01:27:14.035 --> 01:27:17.037
even if you can't imagine
the explanation, Sister.


1089
01:27:18.748 --> 01:27:23.335
Remember, there are things
beyond your knowledge.


1090
01:27:25.046 --> 01:27:30.008
Even if you feel certainty,
it is an emotion, not a fact.


1091
01:27:34.722 --> 01:27:36.932
You will request a transfer

1092
01:27:38.726 --> 01:27:42.104
and take a leave of absence
until it's granted.


1093
01:27:44.774 --> 01:27:46.817
You'd leave me nothing.

1094
01:27:47.568 --> 01:27:50.195
It's Donald Miller who has nothing,

1095
01:27:51.489 --> 01:27:53.365
and you took full advantage of that.

1096
01:27:53.449 --> 01:27:57.369
I've done nothing wrong.
I care about that boy.


1097
01:27:58.413 --> 01:27:59.621
Why?

1098
01:28:03.126 --> 01:28:05.210
'Cause you smile at him?

1099
01:28:06.212 --> 01:28:08.505
And you sympathize with him?

1100
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:12.634
And you talk to him
as if you were the same?


1101
01:28:16.139 --> 01:28:18.598
You are a cheat.

1102
01:28:21.894 --> 01:28:24.688
And that warm feeling you experienced

1103
01:28:25.523 --> 01:28:30.652
when that boy looked at you with trust
was not the sensation of virtue.


1104
01:28:32.029 --> 01:28:35.657
That could be got by any drunkard
with his tot of rum.


1105
01:28:37.827 --> 01:28:39.536
I can fight you.

1106
01:28:40.246 --> 01:28:41.788
You will lose.

1107
01:28:44.959 --> 01:28:47.002
Where's your compassion?

1108
01:28:49.464 --> 01:28:51.631
Nowhere you can get at it.

1109
01:28:55.011 --> 01:28:58.180
Stay here. Compose yourself.

1110
01:28:59.849 --> 01:29:02.434
You can use the phone if you'd like.

1111
01:29:03.853 --> 01:29:05.604
Good day, Father.

1112
01:29:16.949 --> 01:29:19.201
I have no sympathy for you.

1113
01:29:21.662 --> 01:29:24.831
I know you are invulnerable
to true regret.


1114
01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:33.215
And cut your nails.

1115
01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:33.733
Praise God,
from whom all blessings flow


1116
01:30:33.985 --> 01:30:39.155
Praise him all creatures here below

1117
01:30:39.865 --> 01:30:45.161
Praise him above, ye heavenly host

1118
01:30:45.746 --> 01:30:51.668
Praise Father. 
Son and Holy Ghost

1119
01:30:52.044 --> 01:30:58.008
Amen

1120
01:31:06.017 --> 01:31:08.268
I never like to say goodbye,

1121
01:31:11.647 --> 01:31:16.443
but there is a wind behind every one
of us that takes us through our lives.


1122
01:31:18.738 --> 01:31:22.699
We never see it. 
We can't command it.

1123
01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:26.578
We don't even know its purpose.

1124
01:31:28.998 --> 01:31:32.042
'Cause I would have stayed
among you longer.


1125
01:31:32.126 --> 01:31:34.586
But that wind is taking me away.

1126
01:31:40.009 --> 01:31:41.885
I will miss it here,

1127
01:31:43.429 --> 01:31:45.305
and I will miss you.

1128
01:31:47.099 --> 01:31:51.186
But I'm content that the power
that propels me


1129
01:31:52.355 --> 01:31:55.440
does so with superior knowledge

1130
01:31:56.442 --> 01:31:58.652
as to what is for the best,

1131
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:02.947
and that is my faith.

1132
01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:10.121
I would like to come down now
among you


1133
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:12.499
and say goodbye

1134
01:32:14.043 --> 01:32:16.336
and wish you peaceful hearts

1135
01:32:16.962 --> 01:32:18.755
and loving hearts.

1136
01:32:29.767 --> 01:32:31.643
- Goodbye, Senator.
- Father.


1137
01:32:32.687 --> 01:32:34.437
Carol. Thank you so much.
Thank you.


1138
01:32:34.522 --> 01:32:36.231
Bless you, Father.

1139
01:32:36.315 --> 01:32:39.943
- Happy holidays. Susan. Bless you.
- Thank you, Father.


1140
01:32:40.027 --> 01:32:42.612
- Father.
- Thank you.


1141
01:32:42.697 --> 01:32:45.156
Be good. Thank you.

1142
01:32:45.241 --> 01:32:49.202
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.


1143
01:32:52.832 --> 01:32:54.916
Paul. Thank you so much.

1144
01:32:55.668 --> 01:32:58.586
God bless you. Goodbye.

1145
01:33:38.753 --> 01:33:40.920
...a midnight clear

1146
01:33:41.297 --> 01:33:45.175
A glorious song of old

1147
01:33:45.676 --> 01:33:50.305
From angels bending near the Earth

1148
01:34:14.288 --> 01:34:17.207
Sister James. Welcome back.

1149
01:34:17.291 --> 01:34:18.708
Thank you, Sister.

1150
01:34:18.793 --> 01:34:21.503
You were missed. 
How is your brother?

1151
01:34:22.087 --> 01:34:23.797
Better. Much better.

1152
01:34:23.881 --> 01:34:26.966
I'm very glad. 
I prayed for him.

1153
01:34:29.178 --> 01:34:31.471
It was good to get away.
I needed to see my family.


1154
01:34:31.555 --> 01:34:34.974
Mmm. Then I'm glad you did it.

1155
01:34:38.395 --> 01:34:40.522
And Father Flynn is gone?

1156
01:34:41.816 --> 01:34:42.982
Yes.

1157
01:34:45.986 --> 01:34:48.363
So you did it. 
You got him out.

1158
01:34:49.073 --> 01:34:50.198
Yes.

1159
01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:55.495
Donald Miller is heartbroken.

1160
01:34:55.579 --> 01:34:59.541
Can't be helped. 
It's just till June.

1161
01:35:03.587 --> 01:35:06.756
I don't think Father Flynn
did anything wrong.


1162
01:35:07.383 --> 01:35:09.592
No? He convinced you?

1163
01:35:10.219 --> 01:35:11.928
Yes, he did.

1164
01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:19.727
Did you ever prove it?

1165
01:35:20.938 --> 01:35:24.524
- To whom?
- Anyone but yourself?


1166
01:35:25.818 --> 01:35:27.026
Nope.

1167
01:35:27.486 --> 01:35:30.071
- But you were sure?
- Yes.


1168
01:35:34.535 --> 01:35:36.786
I wish I could be like you.

1169
01:35:38.831 --> 01:35:39.956
Why?

1170
01:35:41.584 --> 01:35:43.918
Because I can't sleep anymore.

1171
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:51.342
Maybe we're not supposed to
sleep so well.


1172
01:35:54.096 --> 01:35:57.307
They made Father Flynn
pastor of Saint Jerome.


1173
01:35:59.768 --> 01:36:02.812
- Who?
- The bishop.


1174
01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:10.653
Appointed Father Flynn pastor
of Saint Jerome Church and School.


1175
01:36:12.197 --> 01:36:13.948
It's a promotion.

1176
01:36:15.326 --> 01:36:16.993
You didn't tell them?

1177
01:36:17.077 --> 01:36:21.956
Oh, I told our good monsignor.
I crossed the garden, and I told him.


1178
01:36:25.461 --> 01:36:28.004
He did not believe it to be true.

1179
01:36:31.842 --> 01:36:34.552
Then why did Father Flynn go?

1180
01:36:34.637 --> 01:36:37.263
What did you say to make him leave?

1181
01:36:37.848 --> 01:36:41.142
That I had called a nun
in his previous parish,


1182
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:47.190
that I had found out
his prior history of infringements.


1183
01:36:52.446 --> 01:36:54.280
So you did prove it?

1184
01:36:58.786 --> 01:37:00.620
I made no such call.

1185
01:37:04.792 --> 01:37:07.710
- You lied?
- Yes.


1186
01:37:09.004 --> 01:37:13.758
But if he'd had no such history,
the lie wouldn't have worked.


1187
01:37:17.262 --> 01:37:19.889
His resignation was his confession.

1188
01:37:24.937 --> 01:37:27.313
He was what I thought he was.

1189
01:37:30.317 --> 01:37:31.901
And he's gone.

1190
01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:38.825
I can't believe you lied.

1191
01:37:44.665 --> 01:37:46.958
In the pursuit of wrongdoing,

1192
01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:50.503
one steps away from God.

1193
01:37:54.133 --> 01:37:56.426
Of course, there is a price.

1194
01:38:04.935 --> 01:38:06.144
I see.

1195
01:38:16.697 --> 01:38:18.197
Sister James.

1196
01:38:19.616 --> 01:38:21.409
What is it, Sister?

1197
01:38:27.624 --> 01:38:29.625
I have doubts.

1198
01:38:36.216 --> 01:38:40.595
I have such doubts.

1199
01:38:41.972 --> 01:38:44.348
(ORGN PLAYING THE FIRST NOEL

1200
01:39:29.061 --> 01:39:35.817
Come, thou,
redeemer of the Earth


1201
01:39:36.151 --> 01:39:42.907
And manifest thy virgin birth

1202
01:39:43.158 --> 01:39:49.872
Let every age adoring fall

1203
01:39:50.082 --> 01:39:57.046
Such birth befits the God of all

1204
01:39:58.507 --> 01:40:05.263
Begotten of no human will

1205
01:40:05.639 --> 01:40:12.228
But of the Spirit, thou art still

1206
01:40:12.688 --> 01:40:19.694
The word of God in flesh arrayed

1207
01:40:20.112 --> 01:40:26.993
The promised fruit to man displayed

1208
01:40:28.996 --> 01:40:35.751
The virgin womb that burden gained

1209
01:40:35.961 --> 01:40:42.592
With virgin honor all unstained

1210
01:40:43.177 --> 01:40:49.849
The banners there of virtue glow

1211
01:40:50.350 --> 01:40:57.190
God in his temple dwells below

1212
01:40:59.818 --> 01:41:06.616
Forth from his chamber goeth he

1213
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:13.831
That royal home of purity

1214
01:41:14.249 --> 01:41:21.255
A giant in twofold substance one

1215
01:41:21.673 --> 01:41:28.638
Rejoicing now his course to run

1216
01:41:30.807 --> 01:41:37.813
From God the Father he proceeds

1217
01:41:38.106 --> 01:41:45.112
To God the Father back he speeds

1218
01:41:45.656 --> 01:41:52.662
His course he runs to death and hell

1219
01:41:52.996 --> 01:42:00.002
Retuming on God's throne to dwell

1220
01:42:02.422 --> 01:42:09.345
O equal to thy Father. Thou

1221
01:42:09.429 --> 01:42:16.269
Gird on thy fleshly mantle now

1222
01:42:16.687 --> 01:42:23.693
The weakness of our mortal state

1223
01:42:24.194 --> 01:42:31.200
With deathless might invigorate

1224
01:42:33.787 --> 01:42:40.668
Thy cradle here shall glitter bright

1225
01:42:41.044 --> 01:42:48.009
And darkness breathe a newer light

1226
01:42:48.302 --> 01:42:55.308
Where endless faith shall shine serene

1227
01:42:55.517 --> 01:43:02.481
And twilight never intervene

1228
01:43:04.735 --> 01:43:11.741
All praise, etemal Son, to thee

1229
01:43:13.201 --> 01:43:19.206
Whose advent sets thy people free

1230
01:43:19.291 --> 01:43:26.130
Whom, with the Father, we adore

1231
01:43:26.757 --> 01:43:33.596
And Holy Ghost for evermore
