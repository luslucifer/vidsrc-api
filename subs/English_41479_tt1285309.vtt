Actually, we don't.
I was, uh-


73
00:05:43.735 --> 00:05:45.069
I wasn't able-
Oh. What?


74
00:05:45.195 --> 00:05:48.405

in "conduction"...

with a woman's naturally
fluctuating hormones,

it can leave
your skin a wreck,


77

but you'll find
that the Aphrodite line...

00:06:15.642 --> 00:06:18.936
These rooms are divine.
Thank you.


88
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.065
You should come over
to our house,
and we can talk decor.


89
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.651
Oh, l would love that.

90
00:06:25.735 --> 00:06:30.281
Boy. l'm very "impassionate"'
about interiors myself.


91
00:06:31.741 --> 00:06:33.659
So what line of work
is your husband in?


92
00:06:33.743 --> 00:06:37.204
Well, you know,
he does a little of this
and a little of that,


93
00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:40.457
and mostly he works
on keeping me happy.


94
00:06:40.584 --> 00:06:43.252
Ahh.
Oh, you're right.
This is really a good beer.

wasn't it?
Yeah. It was.


98
00:06:56.141 --> 00:06:59.268
l think that
you may have
overdone it a little.


99
00:07:00.437 --> 00:07:03.105
What do you mean?

100
00:07:04.566 --> 00:07:06.859
Uh, "a vision of beauty"'?

101
00:07:06.943 --> 00:07:09.028
Aw, come on.
I was just having fun.


102
00:07:09.112 --> 00:07:11.197
And she loved it.
Made her day.

00:07:18.872 --> 00:07:21.832
Oh, this is a soft,
soft bed.

to being in it.

00:10:43.493 --> 00:10:45.577
You're not from
around here, are you?


154
00:10:45.662 --> 00:10:47.579
Hmm.

155
00:10:47.664 --> 00:10:49.415
l just saw
that YSL bag...


156
00:10:49.499 --> 00:10:51.375
come down the runway
on style.com,


157
00:10:51.459 --> 00:10:54.044
and I know you didn't
get that around here.


158
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.423
We just moved here
yesterday.
Ah.


159
00:10:57.507 --> 00:11:00.050
So how on earth
did you find me?


160
00:11:00.135 --> 00:11:02.344
Well, l...
do my research,


161
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.849
and anyone who's anyone
knows you're the best.
Isn't that the truth.


162
00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:10.436
And there isn't anyone
who's anyone that I don't know.


163
00:11:12.021 --> 00:11:13.730
Mm-hmm.

164
00:11:17.318 --> 00:11:21.029
So. What are we
going to do today?


165
00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:24.700
l'm a mess
from the move.
I think I need an overhaul.


166
00:11:24.784 --> 00:11:28.036
Sugar, if this is a mess,
then l want whatever
you're taking.


167
00:11:31.708 --> 00:11:34.126
Whoo.
- That'll play.


168
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.712
Nothin' wrong with that.

169
00:11:39.549 --> 00:11:41.550
Clean livin'.
Yeah.


170
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.512
Nice shot.
Thank you.


171
00:11:45.638 --> 00:11:49.308
Ηave you seen
these new MP-52 irons?
I don't believe I have.


172
00:11:49.392 --> 00:11:51.268
They have a lower,
deeper center of gravity,


173
00:11:51.394 --> 00:11:53.270
so they're more forgiving.
Really?


174
00:11:53.396 --> 00:11:55.772
Yeah, so if they'll
forgive me-


175
00:11:55.857 --> 00:11:57.524
they'll forgive anyone.
Very nice.


176
00:11:57.609 --> 00:12:00.277
Excuse me.

177
00:12:00.403 --> 00:12:03.655
Ηey, baby.
Hi, baby.
How's your game?


178
00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.949
My game's great.

179
00:12:06.034 --> 00:12:08.785

some new friends.
Well, I'm trying.


183
00:12:16.836 --> 00:12:20.506
- That's hot.
- Oh, I love this.


184
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:24.009
- The phone's great, but l was

- He's pretty yummy too.


185
00:12:24.093 --> 00:12:27.387
- Hello?
- Don't come home too tired.


186

- Oh.

l love you.

188
00:12:35.396 --> 00:12:38.774
- You lucky bitch.
- I know.


189
00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:41.109
You know what
I'm gonna do for you?


190
00:12:41.194 --> 00:12:44.613
l'm gonna have
a special lunch
to introduce you to my ladies.

Very well.

l did.
I made friends.


196
00:13:01.756 --> 00:13:04.341
Oh. Did you get their,
uh, contact info?


197
00:13:04.425 --> 00:13:06.385
Of course l did.

198
00:13:07.428 --> 00:13:09.471
Great. Well, your dinner's
in the fridge.


199
00:14:36.434 --> 00:14:38.644
You like that?

200
00:14:40.605 --> 00:14:41.772
Jenn?
Ow!


201
00:14:41.898 --> 00:14:43.690
Come on. Let's go.
Shit!


202

Let go of me!
Kate-


203
00:14:45.234 --> 00:14:47.486
Get your clothes on.

204
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.571
- Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I'll handle this.


205
00:14:49.656 --> 00:14:52.491
No. Nothing happened.

206
00:14:52.575 --> 00:14:54.493
Ladies, come on.

207
00:14:54.577 --> 00:14:59.748
Goddamn it, Jenn.
We told them that this
was not going to happen again.


208
00:14:59.874 --> 00:15:02.668
What, are you jealous?
Oh, that's ridiculous.


209
00:15:02.752 --> 00:15:04.878
Now, hold on!

210
00:15:06.506 --> 00:15:08.882
lf you're not gonna do him,
why can't I?


211
00:15:09.008 --> 00:15:11.677
Do you want me to call KC?
Freak's back in action, huh?


212
00:15:11.803 --> 00:15:13.887
Fuck you!
Mick, stay out of this.


213

Shit.

216
00:15:29.696 --> 00:15:32.406
- Why did you let her
in your room?
- Come on. I was sleeping.


217
00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:34.449
You're not blaming me?

218
00:15:35.993 --> 00:15:38.036
She's got a problem.

219
00:15:38.121 --> 00:15:40.330
What am l supposed to do?

220
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:43.667
Well, we're not gonna
solve this tonight,


221
00:15:43.751 --> 00:15:45.669
so we're gonna discuss it
in the morning.


222
00:16:16.367 --> 00:16:19.161
Good morning.
You have a nice glow about you.
Did you sleep well?


223
00:16:19.287 --> 00:16:22.289
Τhat's very funny.
Hi.


224
00:16:22.373 --> 00:16:24.124
- l really think
we should talk-
- Good morning.


225
00:16:24.208 --> 00:16:25.751
Good morning.
We should talk about-


226
00:16:25.877 --> 00:16:27.252
Good morning.
What happened-
Morning.


227
00:16:27.336 --> 00:16:29.254
Good morning.
What happened last night.


228
00:16:29.338 --> 00:16:31.256
Jenn, do you have
something to say?


229
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.966
Oh, yeah.
I'm so sorry.


230
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.219
You know, you're new
and I totally took advantage
of the situation.


231
00:16:36.304 --> 00:16:38.597
l shouldn't do that.
I'm so sorry.


232
00:16:38.681 --> 00:16:41.266
Τhis really wasn't covered
in my orientation.


233
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:43.852
- Well, we may not be
a normal family-
- You think?


234
00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:45.771
but we do have to operate
as a team.


235
00:16:45.855 --> 00:16:47.606
We have a huge
opportunity here.


236
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.983
l'd like to see us
keep our focus.


237
00:16:50.067 --> 00:16:53.361
- Our first review
is in 30 days.
- Gotta sell, sell, sell.


238
00:16:53.488 --> 00:16:57.115
All right.
Can I get a ride with you?
Bite me.


239
00:16:57.241 --> 00:16:59.618
Kate, this is why
l need a car.
I don't wanna hear it.


240
00:16:59.702 --> 00:17:01.161
Mick, wait.

241
00:17:01.245 --> 00:17:03.163
l'm gonna be late
for my hot yoga class.


242
00:17:03.247 --> 00:17:06.249
- Oh, you know, sure.
Τhat's really-
- Have a nice day.


243
00:17:06.375 --> 00:17:09.586
You have a nice day too.

269
00:20:10.768 --> 00:20:12.435
All right, then.

270
00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.689
l'm sure you're all eager
to hear your results...


271
00:20:15.773 --> 00:20:18.066
from our first month
of sales.


272
00:20:19.485 --> 00:20:21.695
Let's start with Steve.

273
00:20:21.779 --> 00:20:24.239
Total sales
in this first month...


274
00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:26.491
up three and a half percent.

275
00:20:26.575 --> 00:20:28.493
Boo-yah!

276
00:20:28.577 --> 00:20:31.246

- Sportswear is up 21 .
- Cool.


285
00:20:54.729 --> 00:20:56.688
Excellent.
Way to open up
the market, Mick.


286
00:20:56.772 --> 00:20:58.398
Good work.

287
00:20:58.482 --> 00:21:01.818
And Jenn-
Up 14% overall.


288
00:21:01.902 --> 00:21:04.779
- Solid work, my dear.
- You did good.


289
00:21:04.905 --> 00:21:07.657
Hey, you're still two down.
Kate-


290
00:21:07.742 --> 00:21:12.495
- Congratulations
on being our top producer.
- Thank you.


291
00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.789
Up 20%.

292
00:21:14.874 --> 00:21:16.624
Wow. Okay.

293
00:21:18.252 --> 00:21:20.587
Wow. Thank you. Thank you.

294
00:21:20.671 --> 00:21:22.380
Cosmetics, up 24.

295
00:21:27.136 --> 00:21:29.054
Great form.

296
00:21:29.138 --> 00:21:31.347
Thank you.

297
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:36.853
Are you focused?

298
00:21:36.937 --> 00:21:38.730
Am I focused?
Yeah, I'm focused.


299
00:21:38.814 --> 00:21:40.690
You know, you were
a great car salesman.


300
00:21:40.775 --> 00:21:43.526
People trusted you
and they liked you,


301
00:21:43.611 --> 00:21:45.570
so they bought
what you were selling.


302
00:21:45.654 --> 00:21:48.073
But you're not
selling things anymore.


303
00:21:48.157 --> 00:21:51.326
To succeed here,
you can't just sell things.


304
00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:55.747
You're here to sell a lifestyle,
an attitude.


305
00:21:55.873 --> 00:21:58.083
Right.
If people want you,


306
00:21:59.251 --> 00:22:01.503
they'll want
what you've got.


307
00:22:08.928 --> 00:22:12.388
Um, do the clients know
how this works?


308
00:22:12.473 --> 00:22:15.934
Of course not.
Τhat's why it's called
"stealth marketing."


309
00:22:16.018 --> 00:22:17.644
The fact is,
we get results.


310
00:22:17.728 --> 00:22:20.021
How we go about that
is our business.


311
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.274
Τhe question you have
to ask yourself is-


312
00:22:23.359 --> 00:22:27.654
Ηow far are you willing
to go to get what you want?


313
00:22:27.738 --> 00:22:29.739
lt's called killer instinct.

314
00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:31.783
lf you can find it,

315
00:22:31.867 --> 00:22:34.410
you could have
anything you want.


316
00:22:34.495 --> 00:22:35.870
Anything.

317
00:22:43.671 --> 00:22:45.171
Τhanks.

318
00:22:46.715 --> 00:22:50.093
l don't think he's got it.
I think we may have to bag him.


319
00:22:50.177 --> 00:22:51.678
No, no. l-

320
00:22:51.762 --> 00:22:54.722
l know he's green.
He just needs some time.


321
00:22:54.807 --> 00:22:57.559
And-And l-l can deal
with this.


322
00:22:57.643 --> 00:22:59.894
l warned you
not to pick a rookie...


323
00:22:59.979 --> 00:23:01.938
in your first
"head of household."


324
00:23:02.022 --> 00:23:05.233
You've known me
a long time.
I can handle this.


325
00:23:07.403 --> 00:23:09.571
l'll give you 60 days.

326
00:23:09.655 --> 00:23:12.740
But this is your ass
on the line, not mine.


327
00:23:12.825 --> 00:23:15.160
Thank you.

328
00:23:15.244 --> 00:23:17.453
Thank you.
You won't regret it.


329
00:23:17.538 --> 00:23:19.956
We'll see, won't we?

330
00:23:24.753 --> 00:23:26.796
We're in a terrible
situation right now.


331
00:23:26.881 --> 00:23:28.047
Why are you talking
about spending?


332
00:23:28.132 --> 00:23:29.716
Have you read
my new book?


333
00:23:29.842 --> 00:23:32.343
I have, and I
disagree with you completely.
Oh, okay.


334
00:23:32.428 --> 00:23:35.180
Looks like
sales for luxury items have
been up for the last two months.


335
00:23:35.264 --> 00:23:36.681
You think we're
in a bulI market?


336
00:23:36.765 --> 00:23:38.349
That's what l said.
Spend, spend, spend.


337
00:23:38.434 --> 00:23:39.684
Bull market's
around the corner.


338
00:23:39.768 --> 00:23:41.394
I understand
that bulls are bad.


339
00:23:41.478 --> 00:23:43.855
Anyone can see
how upside-down
the entire market is.


340
00:23:43.939 --> 00:23:45.481
Foreclosures
at an all-time high-


341
00:23:45.566 --> 00:23:47.609
Τhat's true.
About four million
foreclosed homes this year.


342
00:23:47.693 --> 00:23:49.736
The dollar is
on its way up.
I'm telling you.


343
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.738
If you want
to spend your way out,


344
00:23:51.822 --> 00:23:53.948
the dollar will end up
the same way as the peso.


345
00:23:59.705 --> 00:24:02.624
Ηey.
Hey.


346
00:24:04.335 --> 00:24:09.756
So we need to step it up,
so l've decided that
we're gonna throw a party.


347
00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.384
Jesus. Look at Larry.
He is a miserable bastard.


348
00:24:13.469 --> 00:24:16.054
My guess is they sleep
in separate bedrooms.


349
00:24:16.138 --> 00:24:17.639
Yeah, l know
how that feels.


350
00:24:17.723 --> 00:24:21.100
This is serious,
and l'd really like you
to focus.


351
00:24:21.185 --> 00:24:23.186
Okay?
Hmm?


352
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:26.064
l mean, we really need
to pull out all the stops.


353
00:24:26.148 --> 00:24:28.399
l'd like to put
our contact list to good use...


354
00:24:28.484 --> 00:24:30.443
and start to showcase
all we've got.


355
00:24:30.527 --> 00:24:33.112
lt's a good time
for me to wear the YSL dress.


356
00:24:33.197 --> 00:24:35.490
l'd really like to roll out
the Van Cleef earrings.


357
00:24:35.574 --> 00:24:37.659
l think you have some
of those Costume National that-


358
00:24:37.785 --> 00:24:39.619
Oh, ho, ho, ho.
have a chance to-


359
00:24:39.703 --> 00:24:41.454
Thank you.

360
00:24:43.415 --> 00:24:45.416
l really have some things
that I'd like...


361
00:24:45.501 --> 00:24:47.835
to-to talk to you-

362
00:24:49.171 --> 00:24:51.422
S-So l- Τhere's some things
that I want-


363
00:24:54.218 --> 00:24:56.261
Ηey, Larry.
Come on. Come on.


364
00:24:56.345 --> 00:24:57.762
Hey.
Hey.


365
00:24:57.888 --> 00:25:00.890
I'm on poop patrol here.
Nice. Mind if I ask you
a question?


366
00:25:00.975 --> 00:25:02.892
Ηmm?

367
00:25:02.977 --> 00:25:05.436
Think Kate'll like these?

368
00:25:07.606 --> 00:25:10.733
Cha-cha, bling.
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.


369
00:25:10.859 --> 00:25:13.653
What's the occasion?
No occasion.


370
00:25:14.989 --> 00:25:17.699
Oh, geez.
Summer would love those.
Yeah.


371
00:25:17.825 --> 00:25:20.451
Well, business is good,
isn't it?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.


372
00:25:20.577 --> 00:25:23.871
Τerrific. Absolutely.
This is what it's all about.


373
00:25:23.956 --> 00:25:25.999
Yeah.
Yeah.


374
00:25:26.083 --> 00:25:29.002
Yeah. Yeah, l guess so.
You, uh- Are you
gonna play today?


375
00:25:29.086 --> 00:25:30.920
Oh, uh, no.

376
00:25:31.005 --> 00:25:33.423
You know, l pulled-
I kinda pulled a muscle.


377
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:35.091
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.


378
00:25:35.175 --> 00:25:37.510
Kate and l are into
this new tantric sex thing.


379
00:25:37.594 --> 00:25:39.929
l don't know
how I got in the-


380
00:25:40.014 --> 00:25:41.597
But it, you know-

381
00:25:41.724 --> 00:25:43.224
lt went too far.
Yeah.


382
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:47.312
Well, l, uh-

383
00:25:47.438 --> 00:25:50.315
l sure haven't pulled
any muscles lately.
No?


384
00:25:50.399 --> 00:25:53.151
You know how l keep it fresh
between Kate and me?


385
00:25:53.235 --> 00:25:55.862
Uh, good listening?

386
00:25:55.946 --> 00:25:58.031
No. No, no.

387
00:25:58.115 --> 00:26:00.283
lt's about me
never really believing
that I have her.


388
00:26:00.367 --> 00:26:03.619
Being full of surprises...
and a steady stream of gifts.


389
00:26:20.429 --> 00:26:22.680
It's great to see you.
Hi. How are you?


390
00:26:24.558 --> 00:26:26.184
Ηave you
tried this yet?
Yes, and-


391
00:26:26.268 --> 00:26:28.269
I think
you're gonna love it.


392
00:26:28.354 --> 00:26:31.022
How are you ladies?
Are you enjoying
that Pomtini?


393
00:26:31.106 --> 00:26:33.316
lt's good, yeah?

394
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.611
Well, we'll just, uh,
make sure we'll keep 'em coming.


395
00:26:38.614 --> 00:26:42.742
This vodka is either-
lt's either from Mexico
or Antarctica.


396
00:26:42.868 --> 00:26:45.620
How are you guys doing?
Hi.
Hey.


397
00:26:45.704 --> 00:26:47.872
Oh, those earrings
are gorgeous.


398
00:26:47.956 --> 00:26:49.749
Τhank you.
Steve surprised me.


399
00:26:49.875 --> 00:26:52.377
What was
the occasion?
It was a Tuesday gift.


400
00:26:52.503 --> 00:26:54.837
Tuesday?
What's a Tuesday gift?


401
00:26:55.923 --> 00:26:58.216
Just for being Tuesday.

402
00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.301
Oh, my.
That's so romantic.


403
00:27:00.427 --> 00:27:03.137
Makes me want
a cannelloni.


404
00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:06.265
- These are delicious.
- You like 'em?


405
00:27:06.392 --> 00:27:08.267
Mm-hmm.
Who does your catering?


406
00:27:08.394 --> 00:27:10.269
Chef Robert.

407
00:27:10.354 --> 00:27:11.771
No.
Really?


408
00:27:12.898 --> 00:27:15.525
Excuse me.
Will you show that?


409
00:27:17.861 --> 00:27:20.321
l didn't know
he was doing frozen food.
Can you believe it?


410
00:27:20.447 --> 00:27:24.283
Ooh.
You know, we had the most
incredible chicken "fricazini,"


411
00:27:24.368 --> 00:27:26.202
homemade,
at the Robustion spring gala-


412
00:27:26.286 --> 00:27:28.079
Oh, l've got to try
the sushi.


413
00:27:28.163 --> 00:27:31.833
Ohh! Now, this is one thing
you won't find
in your freezer.


414
00:27:31.917 --> 00:27:34.335
Oh, yes, it is.

415
00:27:36.713 --> 00:27:41.259
Wataru
flash-frozen sushi.


416
00:27:41.343 --> 00:27:45.513
This is the view
from base camp.


417
00:27:45.597 --> 00:27:47.682
l can't believe
you actually
climbed Everest.


418
00:27:47.766 --> 00:27:49.434
Τhe Sherpas
are the key, you know.


419
00:27:49.518 --> 00:27:52.395
You don't wanna do it
without the Sherpas.


420
00:27:52.479 --> 00:27:53.896
Man, this system's great.

421
00:27:53.981 --> 00:27:55.481
Yeah, with the bundle
of services,


422
00:27:55.566 --> 00:27:57.066
you get the clearest
HD picture.


423
00:27:57.151 --> 00:27:59.068
All your personal media
is just a click away.


424
00:27:59.194 --> 00:28:00.945
You can see it-
What are you boys up to?


425
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:02.947
...best HD picture.

426
00:28:03.031 --> 00:28:05.116
Are you showing off
your new toy?


427
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.326
Guilty. Yeah.

428
00:28:12.082 --> 00:28:15.168
And... who's
your favorite toy?


429
00:28:16.837 --> 00:28:18.421
You are.

430
00:28:19.423 --> 00:28:21.424
Mm-hmm.

431
00:28:26.054 --> 00:28:28.055
All right,
can I get you guys another-


432
00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.308
No, no. l'm good.
It's a little hot in here.


433
00:28:30.392 --> 00:28:32.059
Thank you.

434
00:28:32.144 --> 00:28:34.228
Maybe a big boy drink?
No, I'm good, thank you.


435
00:28:34.313 --> 00:28:37.231
- Do you want something?
- Um, I'm-I'm-


436
00:28:37.316 --> 00:28:39.025
Nice.

437
00:28:42.946 --> 00:28:44.238
Where were we?

438
00:28:44.323 --> 00:28:46.324
Watch for the guy
on the top right now.


439
00:28:46.408 --> 00:28:47.950
All right.
Shoot him.
Shoot him now.


440
00:28:49.161 --> 00:28:50.912
Oh, awesome!
Told you this was easy.


441
00:28:56.793 --> 00:29:00.046
What kind of shit
did your parents do
to get you that thing?


442
00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:03.341
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, l know a guilt gift
when I see one,


443
00:29:03.425 --> 00:29:05.676
and that one's got
"l'm sorry for being
a fucked-up parent"...


444
00:29:05.761 --> 00:29:07.678
written all over it.

445
00:29:07.763 --> 00:29:10.640
Yeah, l guess so.

446
00:29:10.766 --> 00:29:12.308
I'm Naomi.
Mick.


447
00:29:12.392 --> 00:29:13.768
I know.
Hmm?


448
00:29:13.852 --> 00:29:15.561
You have this whole
cult following
at school.


449
00:29:15.687 --> 00:29:17.897
l do?
Yeah. You've been there,
what, two months?


450
00:29:17.981 --> 00:29:19.690
Everyone's drinking
your Kool-Aid.


451
00:29:22.236 --> 00:29:24.779
So, why are you here?
You a friend of Jenn's?


452
00:29:24.863 --> 00:29:27.490
Yeah, right. Yeah.
Can't you see me
with that crowd?


453
00:29:27.574 --> 00:29:29.742
Mmm.

454
00:29:29.868 --> 00:29:31.869
Nah.
No, not really.


455
00:29:31.995 --> 00:29:34.121
l'm here with my parents.
Mmm.


456
00:29:36.291 --> 00:29:38.793
Wanna get high?

457
00:29:40.337 --> 00:29:42.338
Sure. Yeah.

458
00:29:46.677 --> 00:29:48.636
Wow.
Oh, yeah.


459
00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.639
Well, it must be really big
to be called "the hammer."


460
00:29:51.723 --> 00:29:54.559
Well, yeah.
I'd love to show it to you.


461
00:29:54.643 --> 00:29:56.435
Really?

462
00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:00.022
Yeah. You'll have to stop by
the marina one day-


463
00:30:00.148 --> 00:30:03.192
soon.
I would love to.


464
00:30:03.277 --> 00:30:05.194
Τhat'd be great.

465
00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:08.656
Yeah. You know what?
I'm gonna have to go.


466
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.492
Well, it was nice
meeting you, Mr. Bayner.


467
00:30:11.577 --> 00:30:13.494
You too. Bye, now.

468
00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.416
Oh, there you are, sweetheart.
Ηow's it going?
You have a good time?


469
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.875
And her hair
was not-


470
00:30:22.004 --> 00:30:24.338
Yeah.

471
00:30:27.175 --> 00:30:30.553
What are you doing?
Mingling.


472
00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:35.433
Maybe you might wanna
go and show the girls
your room.


473
00:30:35.517 --> 00:30:37.018
Υay.

474
00:30:38.604 --> 00:30:40.813
How are you guys doing?

475
00:30:40.897 --> 00:30:42.690
Τhis sushi
is incredible.


476
00:30:42.816 --> 00:30:45.192
You guys are so wonderful.
Nobody throws
a party like you do.


477
00:30:45.319 --> 00:30:47.903
Well,
we'll have to do it again.


478
00:30:47.988 --> 00:30:50.656
- Troublemaker.
- Hey, look who's here.


479
00:30:50.741 --> 00:30:53.409
You know who this is.
The lady of the evening.


480
00:30:53.493 --> 00:30:55.453
Hey, Naomi?
Mm-hmm.


481
00:30:55.537 --> 00:30:58.497
Do you wanna know
why all those people
are in my house right now?


482
00:30:58.624 --> 00:31:02.084
lt's a party. Duh.
Yeah.


483
00:31:02.169 --> 00:31:05.921
No, it's so my
so-called "family"...


484
00:31:06.006 --> 00:31:08.507
can show off
all their shit.


485
00:31:08.592 --> 00:31:11.594
And you know
all those people...


486
00:31:11.678 --> 00:31:14.805
are fucking
blown away by it all.


487
00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:16.807
Yeah.

488
00:31:16.892 --> 00:31:19.685
That sounds like something
my parents would do.


489
00:31:22.314 --> 00:31:25.566
Aren't you two
the sexy couple?
Oh.


490
00:31:25.651 --> 00:31:28.194
Don't forget
about lunch next week.


491
00:31:28.278 --> 00:31:30.738
Good night.

492
00:31:31.823 --> 00:31:33.699
Um-
l, uh-


493
00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:36.786
l think it went-went
great... tonight.
Uh-huh. Yeah.


494
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:40.414
l mean, l personally
didn't feel like l, uh,
connected with Melanie.


495
00:31:40.499 --> 00:31:42.917
l don't know if you-
Did you speak with
her husband, Alex?


496
00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:45.836
Don't-Don't-
Slow down. Slow down.
It was fine. It was perfect.


497
00:31:45.921 --> 00:31:51.592
You were perfect. You-
You know, you don't realize
the effect you have on people.


498
00:31:52.803 --> 00:31:54.804
Thank you.

499
00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:58.933
Um, just, uh,
doing my job.
Yeah.


500
00:32:00.602 --> 00:32:03.062
You might want
to lay off the Robert
hors d'oeuvres though.


501
00:32:03.188 --> 00:32:07.566
Why? What do you mean?
Oh, God.
Loaded in garlic.


502
00:32:07.693 --> 00:32:10.403
Are you kidding? Really?
No, not kidding.
No, no, no.


503
00:32:10.529 --> 00:32:12.780
Oh, my God.
Good night.


504
00:32:18.662 --> 00:32:20.621
Some party tonight, huh?

505
00:32:20.706 --> 00:32:22.623
Oh, my God.

506
00:32:22.708 --> 00:32:26.335
Τhat house. l could die
for that dining set.


507
00:32:28.588 --> 00:32:30.506
Τhink she'll buy
any of your products?


508
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:32.508
They seem to buy
everything else.


509
00:32:32.592 --> 00:32:36.846
l think l can make her
if l... concentrate
on it hard enough.


510
00:32:42.477 --> 00:32:45.062
You look really
beautiful tonight.


511
00:32:45.147 --> 00:32:47.064
Honey,

512
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:50.860
you know that my inspirations
need to be my last thoughts
before I go to sleep.


513
00:32:50.944 --> 00:32:53.028
This is how
I get what I want.


514
00:32:58.994 --> 00:33:01.370
You should really
try it sometime.


515
00:33:09.421 --> 00:33:13.174
l think it could
really help you, Larry.


516
00:33:32.819 --> 00:33:34.445
Shh, sh, sh, sh,
sh, sh, sh.


517
00:34:00.347 --> 00:34:02.264
Hey.
Mind if I join you?


518
00:34:02.349 --> 00:34:04.266
Sure, come on.

519
00:34:05.268 --> 00:34:07.144
Want some burrito?
Ah.


520
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:09.939
Chef Robert.
No, thank you. I-
l ate something earlier.


521
00:34:10.023 --> 00:34:12.316
- Yeah?
What did you have?
- A protein bar.


522
00:34:12.442 --> 00:34:13.776
A protein bar?
Yeah.


523
00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.277
Mmm, tasty.

524
00:34:15.362 --> 00:34:17.822
So l was just
looking at the numbers
since the party.


525
00:34:17.906 --> 00:34:19.782
- And you're-you're
really improving.
- Great.


526
00:34:19.866 --> 00:34:23.828
l thought maybe
we could talk about ways
that you could do even better.


527
00:34:23.912 --> 00:34:25.871
Mmm. Kate, come on.
It's our day off.


528
00:34:25.956 --> 00:34:27.665
l thought maybe
we wouldn't talk shop.


529
00:34:27.749 --> 00:34:29.667
But this is
really important.


530
00:34:29.751 --> 00:34:32.586
l mean, you're still
selling to individuals
and what you want to create...


531
00:34:32.712 --> 00:34:36.090
is a ripple effect where you get
other people selling for you.
You should maybe relax.


532
00:34:36.174 --> 00:34:38.050
ls there anything
you like to do to relax?


533
00:34:38.176 --> 00:34:41.679
Like go shopping or watch
some football or get a massage?
There's always people...


534
00:34:41.805 --> 00:34:44.056
who others look to
for advice-
You like massages, don't you?


535
00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:46.058
or the inside scoop.

536
00:34:46.142 --> 00:34:49.687
And then they become
the connectors that reach
the consumer on your behalf.


537
00:34:49.771 --> 00:34:52.231
Do you know what l mean?

538
00:34:52.357 --> 00:34:54.608
What?

539
00:34:54.693 --> 00:34:58.195
l just thought we'd have
a normal conversation
like normal people today.


540
00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.239
l don't know if you
understand the pressure.


541
00:35:00.323 --> 00:35:03.826
l mean, you know,
this isn't about me
selling my products.


542
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:06.829
l have to ensure that
my unit is selling
their products.


543
00:35:06.913 --> 00:35:09.582
You have a unit?

544
00:35:13.211 --> 00:35:16.714
That explains why we're
in separate bedrooms perhaps.


545
00:35:19.593 --> 00:35:24.513
You're not a great salesman.
You're a charismatic guy
and that's great.


546
00:35:24.598 --> 00:35:28.517
But if you don't apply
yourself, then that's all
you're gonna be.


547
00:35:28.643 --> 00:35:31.979
So this is just business, huh?
Yeah, this is business.


548
00:35:32.063 --> 00:35:34.940
And l'm your boss. l don't-
I don't need to be friends.


549
00:35:35.025 --> 00:35:37.234
Oh. Okay. Boss.

550
00:35:37.319 --> 00:35:42.448
Ripple effect.
Connectors. Unit. l got it.


551
00:35:42.574 --> 00:35:44.825
Glad we could talk.
Great.


552
00:35:59.549 --> 00:36:02.760
Yeah, Bill Johnson said
you turned him on to these.


553
00:36:02.844 --> 00:36:05.346
Can't stop talking about how
great the polarized lenses are.


554
00:36:05.472 --> 00:36:07.681
Yeah, those are sweet.
I know you'll love 'em.


555
00:36:07.807 --> 00:36:10.351
Thanks. Put them on my account.
Great.
No problem, gentlemen.


556
00:36:12.437 --> 00:36:14.480
I think
I'm gonna get some too.


557
00:36:18.401 --> 00:36:21.236
- Anything l can help
you with, Mr. Jones?
- I'd like to book a lesson.


558
00:36:21.321 --> 00:36:23.656
Sure. No problem.

559
00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:27.076
Let's see. I can get you in
on Thursday with Bob Senior.


560
00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:30.287
No, no, no. l would like
to book a lesson with you, Will.


561
00:36:30.372 --> 00:36:32.414
- Really?
- Mm-hmm. You teach, don't you?


562
00:36:32.499 --> 00:36:34.083
Well, yeah,
mostly to kids.


563
00:36:34.167 --> 00:36:36.710
l saw you out there
the other day.
You got a sweet swing.


564
00:36:39.381 --> 00:36:41.006
Oh, hey.
Hey.


565
00:36:41.091 --> 00:36:42.967
Sorry.

566
00:36:43.093 --> 00:36:45.094
How was your day today?
Fine.


567
00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:47.137
Ηow was yours?
Good.


568
00:36:47.222 --> 00:36:50.975
You know,
l wanted to talk to you,
uh, about our conversation.


569
00:36:51.059 --> 00:36:53.686
Oh, forget about it.
Business is business.


570
00:37:02.737 --> 00:37:06.031
Okay, nice.
A little more weight
on your back foot there.


571
00:37:06.157 --> 00:37:08.075
Back foot?
Yeah.


572
00:37:10.745 --> 00:37:13.038
Nice.

573
00:37:13.123 --> 00:37:17.918
Will, I do believe you just
added 40 yards to my drive.


574
00:37:18.044 --> 00:37:20.254
You're a magician.
Let me see that driver.


575
00:37:21.756 --> 00:37:25.134
Will, thanks for pairing me up
with those guys today.


576
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.928
Ηey, no problem, Mr. Jones.
Who am I playing
with tomorrow?


577
00:37:28.054 --> 00:37:30.973
Don't worry. l got a great
threesome lined up for you.
You the man.


578
00:37:31.099 --> 00:37:34.893
Cool shirt, by the way.
Oh, thank you.
Under Armour.


579
00:37:34.978 --> 00:37:36.895
lf you're looking for drivers,
these are the best.


580
00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:40.441
l was on the course today,
and Mr. Jones drove a 320.
It was awesome.


581
00:37:44.779 --> 00:37:48.532
Whoa, nice shot, Charlie.
I wish I could take credit.


582
00:37:48.616 --> 00:37:51.118
The kid in the clubhouse
turned me on to those
new Mizunos.


583
00:37:51.202 --> 00:37:53.245
Τhat kid's got the scoop
on everything.


584
00:38:05.175 --> 00:38:08.719
- Τennis, huh?
- Yeah, doubles with
Melanie and the girls.


585
00:38:08.803 --> 00:38:12.306
- Cute outfit.
- Your numbers are looking good.


586
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.599
Thanks, boss.

587
00:38:16.603 --> 00:38:19.146
Great, Steve.
Thanks.
Don't mention it.


588
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.398
Hand rolled
from Cuban seeds.


589
00:38:21.483 --> 00:38:23.442
Ηey, you want to join us
for drinks later?


590
00:38:23.526 --> 00:38:26.737
Uh, what, are you kidding?
First round's on me, boys.


591
00:38:26.821 --> 00:38:28.781
Nice watch.

592
00:38:28.865 --> 00:38:31.784
Hey, whoever dies
with the most toys wins.


593
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:39.041
No, don't be silly. Let me-
Let me help you with this.


594
00:38:39.125 --> 00:38:41.251
Well, l'll invite
some friends over,


595
00:38:41.336 --> 00:38:44.546
and then you can bring
whatever mask over
that you'd like to try.


596
00:38:44.631 --> 00:38:48.509
We're gonna absolutely
help you get some new customers,
and we'll have a nice time.


597
00:38:48.593 --> 00:38:51.887
All right, Summer.
No problem.


598
00:38:51.971 --> 00:38:54.181
Yes.

599
00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:56.600
Doesn't it feel wonderful?

600
00:38:56.684 --> 00:38:58.811
It's the Robustion
"Replenishingister" Mask,


601
00:38:58.895 --> 00:39:01.563
and it's got ginkgo
and wasabi extract.


602
00:39:01.648 --> 00:39:04.733
Τhis house is gorgeous.
Can you get over the furniture?


603
00:39:04.859 --> 00:39:07.736
More champagne, ladies?
It's all the latest
Ethan Allen.


604
00:39:07.821 --> 00:39:09.780
He's got fabulous things.

605
00:39:09.864 --> 00:39:13.659
I know because l was just
at the design center myself
yesterday Iooking at new things.


606
00:39:13.743 --> 00:39:16.829
Ladies, l just came
from the washroom,


607
00:39:16.913 --> 00:39:19.540
and the toilet seat raised up
and waved to me.


608
00:39:19.624 --> 00:39:21.250
Well!
Whoo!


609
00:39:21.334 --> 00:39:23.585
Well, l hope that
you introduced yourself.


610
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:25.379
Huh?

611
00:39:25.463 --> 00:39:29.133
- Τo Τoto, my Τokyo toilet.
- Toto?


612
00:39:29.217 --> 00:39:31.885
Well, if that's Τoto,
then just call me the Wizard.


613
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:35.764
'Cause it gave me a power wash
to my undercarriage,
and a happy-ending blow-dry.


614
00:39:35.849 --> 00:39:40.018
Whoo-hoo!

615
00:39:40.103 --> 00:39:43.397
And let me just say,
with a friend like Toto,


616
00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:46.150
that you are never lonely.

617
00:39:46.234 --> 00:39:49.111
Where is that fabulous
husband of yours?


618
00:39:49.195 --> 00:39:52.072
Ah, golfing, where else?

619
00:39:52.198 --> 00:39:54.116
A man's work
is never done, huh?
Never.


620
00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.326
Honey, l am home.

621
00:39:56.452 --> 00:39:58.912

Just applying myself.

628
00:40:39.204 --> 00:40:41.371
Don't tell me the ladies

How are you doing?
Where you been, man?


683

friend of Steve's.


692
00:44:32.395 --> 00:44:35.689
l wish that I knew you,
but I think you've got me
mistaken with somebody else.


693
00:44:35.815 --> 00:44:38.316
l think you've made a mistake.
I don't think-
Are you-


694
00:44:38.401 --> 00:44:40.152
- l'm not that guy.
- What?


695
00:44:40.236 --> 00:44:42.404
Could you please

A breath of fresh air.


696
00:44:42.488 --> 00:44:44.406
- l don't need air.
- Walk this way.


697
00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:46.533
What are you talking about?

698
00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:49.911
I don't get it.
That's not cool, dude.


699
00:44:49.996 --> 00:44:52.247
l am terribly, terribly sorry.

700
00:44:52.331 --> 00:44:56.209
- Please enjoy your dinner.
- Whoa.


701
00:44:56.335 --> 00:44:58.670
That was odd.
That was weird.


702
00:44:58.754 --> 00:45:01.673
That is like the third time
since we've been here...


703
00:45:01.757 --> 00:45:04.718
that somebody's mistaken you
for this Steve Cer-


704

Ηas it been three times?
Yes.


705

707
00:45:13.394 --> 00:45:16.646
Anyway-
Do you have some kind
of secret life going on?


708
00:45:16.772 --> 00:45:19.483
Baby, you bet l do.

709
00:45:19.567 --> 00:45:23.236
- To secret lives.
- To secret lives.


710
00:45:23.321 --> 00:45:25.572
Cheers.

711
00:45:36.584 --> 00:45:40.212
You look like
you could use a drink.
Thank you.


712
00:45:42.882 --> 00:45:46.593
l think the kids
must be working late.


713
00:45:48.095 --> 00:45:52.390
You know, Jenn,
l- l don't know
if she's taking my advice,


714
00:45:52.475 --> 00:45:56.394
but I- l actually think that
she's starting to get it.


715
00:46:00.775 --> 00:46:02.692
Oh, you smell great.

716
00:46:02.777 --> 00:46:04.653

Oh, yes.
You Iike that, baby?


718
00:46:08.407 --> 00:46:11.868
Here you go,
super-stud of Scottsdale.


719
00:46:11.953 --> 00:46:15.455
Well, it's not as big
of an achievement as it sounds.


720
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:19.084
lt was more of
a retirement community.


721
00:46:24.006 --> 00:46:26.174
You know the great thing
about this job?


722
00:46:26.259 --> 00:46:28.176
What?

723
00:46:28.261 --> 00:46:31.179

729

Stop.

730
00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:03.420
What?
We can't.


731
00:47:03.504 --> 00:47:05.839
Why not?

732
00:47:05.923 --> 00:47:08.466

733

lt has to be.

Hey, hey, Steve.

Look at you.

738
00:48:01.103 --> 00:48:03.980
You're kidding.
That is awesome.
I thought I'd go with the red.


739
00:48:04.065 --> 00:48:06.566
Just a little bit
hotter than the gray,
what do you think?


740
00:48:06.692 --> 00:48:08.568
I'm jealous.

741
00:48:08.694 --> 00:48:12.155
You look different.

742
00:48:12.281 --> 00:48:14.616
You dog.
Oh, yes.


743

Holler at a player, yo.
Steady stream of gifts.

Sweet.
I'm taking care
of the luxuries.


745
00:48:20.164 --> 00:48:23.875
Okay, that's great.
I got something for you too.


746
00:48:24.001 --> 00:48:27.003
You didn't have to do that.
It's top of the line.
Laser guide.


747
00:48:27.088 --> 00:48:29.547
No, l can't- l can't take that.

748
00:48:29.632 --> 00:48:33.968
No, seriously, Steve.
l insist. l really want to
thank you for helping me out.


749
00:48:34.053 --> 00:48:36.680
What are friends for, right?

750
00:48:36.806 --> 00:48:39.557
Enjoy it.
Well, thank you.


751
00:48:39.642 --> 00:48:42.102
You bet. Τake care.

752
00:48:42.228 --> 00:48:45.730
Say hi to that
wife of yours.
All right.


753
00:48:47.525 --> 00:48:50.527
Do you mind
just looking into the camera
and stating your name?


754
00:48:50.611 --> 00:48:52.779
Steve Cerrilla.

755
00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:55.907
So let me ask you.
TelI me about yourself.


756
00:48:55.991 --> 00:48:59.244
I- You really came very,
uh, highly recommended,


757
00:48:59.328 --> 00:49:02.747
and your resume
is very impressive.
Thank you.


758
00:49:02.832 --> 00:49:04.999
So you would be the-

759
00:49:05.084 --> 00:49:08.878
the one who was, uh,
playing the role with me.


760
00:49:08.963 --> 00:49:11.881
Um, yes, I would.

761
00:49:11.966 --> 00:49:14.300
Have you ever
worked for a woman?


762
00:49:14.385 --> 00:49:17.387
Well, it's something
I've thought about
a lot recentIy.


763
00:49:17.513 --> 00:49:20.432
Because I have never
been married-
I saw that.


764
00:49:20.516 --> 00:49:24.018
Either real or imaginary.

765
00:49:24.103 --> 00:49:26.813
In all seriousness,
I've-I've thought...


766
00:49:28.149 --> 00:49:31.317
what it might be like
to meet a woman...


767
00:49:31.402 --> 00:49:34.404
who l would be
a better person for.


768
00:49:34.488 --> 00:49:36.573
Τhat just hasn't happened, so-

769
00:50:02.183 --> 00:50:04.017
Hey, you know,
I got an idea.


770
00:50:06.312 --> 00:50:08.438
Why don't we
see a movie today?


771
00:50:08.522 --> 00:50:11.191
l don't get it.
What would we sell there?


772
00:50:11.275 --> 00:50:13.067
Nothing, it's just,
you know, for fun.


773
00:50:13.152 --> 00:50:15.862
Movie. Fun.
Oh.


774
00:50:17.782 --> 00:50:21.326
Yeah, well, l'm busy.
Sorry, dude.


775
00:50:23.162 --> 00:50:25.079
lt's their day off.

776
00:50:27.792 --> 00:50:30.126
Can l ask you a question?
Sure.


777
00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.798
What were your other

778
00:50:34.882 --> 00:50:37.467
There weren't 12.

779
00:50:37.551 --> 00:50:39.594
Okay, 10. Whatever.

780
00:50:39.678 --> 00:50:41.554
Please, there were six.

781
00:50:41.639 --> 00:50:45.183
Six? Okay, Henry VIll.
What were they like?


782
00:50:45.267 --> 00:50:47.852
- l don't know.
- You don't know?
You spend a year with a guy,


783
00:50:47.937 --> 00:50:50.563
pretending to be husband
and wife and you don't
get to know him at all?


784
00:50:50.648 --> 00:50:53.566
Well, you know,
you've seen one Mr. Jones,
you've seen 'em all.


785
00:50:55.945 --> 00:50:58.655
All right.
You can laugh.


786
00:50:58.739 --> 00:51:03.409
All right, well,
l'm gonna... take my coffee
down to the basement, all right?


787
00:51:03.494 --> 00:51:06.079
See you later.

788
00:51:06.205 --> 00:51:09.624
Bye.
Have a nice day off, okay?


789
00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.756
Merry Christmas, everybody.
Merry Christmas.


790
00:51:16.841 --> 00:51:21.594
As you can see, these are
the products our clients
are pushing for the holidays.


791
00:51:21.679 --> 00:51:24.264
And it's up to you
to make sure...


792
00:51:24.348 --> 00:51:28.518
they're under
every tree in town-
Nice.


793
00:51:28.602 --> 00:51:32.146
Well, l can't, uh-
l can't say that
I'm hating this.


794
00:51:32.231 --> 00:51:35.316
- l'm glad that you like it.
- You have excellent taste.


795
00:51:35.401 --> 00:51:37.318
- Τhank you.
- Is this for me?


796
00:51:37.403 --> 00:51:40.280
- No. They're for
your girlfriend, Naomi.


797
00:51:40.364 --> 00:51:43.324
She'll be selling
to her little counter-culture
friends without even knowing it.


798
00:51:43.409 --> 00:51:45.743
If she's gonna be with you,
she's gonna need some styIe.


799
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:48.288
Do l look like Elton John?
Jenn.


800
00:51:48.372 --> 00:51:53.167
Kate tells me you don't
have a boyfriend yet,
which is unusual for you, no?


801
00:51:53.294 --> 00:51:56.629
It would be nice
if you could have...


802
00:51:56.714 --> 00:51:58.756
a romantic interest
by Christmas, huh?


803
00:51:58.841 --> 00:52:00.925
Working on it.

804
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:03.678
Τhis has been
in the stores 10 days.


805
00:52:03.762 --> 00:52:08.933
"Rudy's Rum Punch."
Mmm, 17% alcohol. Ow!


806
00:52:10.352 --> 00:52:13.104
Not for you.

807
00:52:13.188 --> 00:52:17.358
- A bit lowbrow,
don't you think?
- It's up to you to change that.


808
00:52:17.443 --> 00:52:21.487
Uh, there's one other
thing I almost forgot.
Steve, wanna come outside?


809
00:52:22.615 --> 00:52:24.616
Enjoy.

810
00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:31.915
The all new Audi R8.
Yeah?


811
00:52:31.999 --> 00:52:35.877
lt's for you. I thought
you deserve a little bonus.


812
00:52:35.961 --> 00:52:39.631
Your numbers have shown
tremendous improvement.


813
00:52:39.715 --> 00:52:43.051
Keep it up
and this cell
could make icon status.


814
00:52:43.135 --> 00:52:45.345
Go on. l'll bet
you look great in it.


815
00:52:57.107 --> 00:52:59.317
Whoo.

816
00:52:59.401 --> 00:53:01.569
Hey, Mick. Check it out.

817
00:53:02.821 --> 00:53:05.323
Get in.

818
00:53:10.037 --> 00:53:12.372
ls something
bothering you?


819
00:53:13.707 --> 00:53:16.209
l don't know.
You know, if, uh-


820
00:53:16.293 --> 00:53:19.212
if you want to talk
about something,


821
00:53:19.296 --> 00:53:23.132
anything, you know,
you can always just,


822
00:53:23.217 --> 00:53:25.635
you know, talk
to your fake mother,


823
00:53:25.719 --> 00:53:27.220
or you can talk to me.

824
00:53:28.889 --> 00:53:30.807
Τhis whole act,
it just- it gets to me.


825
00:53:30.933 --> 00:53:34.352
Who's acting?
l love this car.


826
00:53:37.356 --> 00:53:40.316
That's not what l meant.

827
00:53:40.401 --> 00:53:42.777
Just think of it this way.
We're making a match...


828
00:53:42.861 --> 00:53:44.779
between great products
and the people that want them.


829
00:53:44.863 --> 00:53:46.781
It's a service.

830
00:53:48.033 --> 00:53:49.951
Hey, Larry.

831
00:53:52.037 --> 00:53:54.455
♪ We at it again
Everybody on the dance floor ♪


832
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:57.250
Wow.

833
00:53:57.334 --> 00:53:59.961
♪ We at it again ♪

834
00:54:00.087 --> 00:54:02.130
Lookin' good, Steve.
You too, player.


835
00:54:02.214 --> 00:54:04.132
♪ We at it again ♪

836
00:54:04.216 --> 00:54:06.134
♪ Everybody
on the dance floor ♪♪


837
00:54:06.218 --> 00:54:09.387
l think you just
ruined his day.


838
00:54:13.475 --> 00:54:15.852
Oh, sweet.

839
00:54:15.936 --> 00:54:17.895
Sweet, indeed.

840
00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:20.690
l just wanted to remind you
that we have dinner
reservations at 8:00.


841
00:54:20.774 --> 00:54:23.067
Oh, good.
That sounds good.
Want to hit a few?


842
00:54:23.193 --> 00:54:25.945
Golf? No.
Yeah, come on.
I'll teach you.


843
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:28.740
Τhat's what l did before
the job at the dealership-
I taught golf.


844
00:54:28.824 --> 00:54:30.742
Ηang on to that.

845
00:54:30.826 --> 00:54:33.578
You're gonna hit some
golf balls. Have you
ever done it before?


846
00:54:33.704 --> 00:54:35.621
No. Uh-
Okay. Perfect.


847
00:54:35.706 --> 00:54:39.709
Your knees bend in
a little bit. Weight on
the inside of your feet.


848
00:54:39.835 --> 00:54:41.878
Straight back with the butt
out a little bit.
Butt out?


849
00:54:41.962 --> 00:54:43.921
Very nice.
Okay.


850
00:54:44.048 --> 00:54:46.799
Well, the hair. I'm just-
Okay, go ahead.
l-l got it.


851
00:54:46.884 --> 00:54:48.801
Go.

852
00:54:52.681 --> 00:54:54.599
What does icon mean?
Oh! Whoa!


853
00:54:56.435 --> 00:54:58.936
That's a no-no.
I spoke on your backswing.


854
00:54:59.021 --> 00:55:02.023
- Where did you hear that?
- KC said something about it.


855
00:55:02.107 --> 00:55:03.566
Exactly what did she say?

856
00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:06.527
She said something
about making icon status
or something like that.


857
00:55:07.613 --> 00:55:09.614
Do you know
what that means?
No.


858
00:55:09.698 --> 00:55:12.909
lt's the top tier
of the family cells.


859
00:55:12.993 --> 00:55:16.329
l mean, we'll be bringing
high-end goods to market first.


860
00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:19.999
Lifelmage is gonna be
looking for our input...


861
00:55:20.084 --> 00:55:23.169
before proceeding
with any products.


862
00:55:23.253 --> 00:55:27.715
You and me. Do you know
how long that l have been
working towards this?


863
00:55:27.841 --> 00:55:31.385
Oh, my God.
Oh, wow. That's-


864
00:55:31.512 --> 00:55:33.971
Oh. l'm sorry.
That's okay.


865
00:55:38.685 --> 00:55:41.354
Geez. I should say
"icon" more often.


866
00:55:42.523 --> 00:55:44.732
I love boats.
I just wanna...


867
00:55:44.817 --> 00:55:48.152
go away
with you forever.


868
00:55:48.237 --> 00:55:50.613
We could sail
the Mediterranean.


869
00:55:53.534 --> 00:55:56.035
You wouldn't believe
how beautiful it is.
Mmm.


870
00:55:57.287 --> 00:55:59.372
l can imagine.

871
00:56:05.337 --> 00:56:07.713
Where are the Bayners?

872
00:56:07.798 --> 00:56:10.383
Are they... habitually late?

873
00:56:11.677 --> 00:56:13.594
l have a confession
to make.


874
00:56:13.679 --> 00:56:15.388
Um,

875
00:56:15.472 --> 00:56:17.807
l don't think they're
gonna make it tonight.


876
00:56:17.891 --> 00:56:20.017
Alex is actually
working late and-


877
00:56:20.144 --> 00:56:22.228
Really?
Yeah.


878
00:56:22.312 --> 00:56:24.564
- So it's just me and you?
- Yep.


879
00:56:25.566 --> 00:56:28.901
l mean, l was
thinking that, uh,


880
00:56:30.154 --> 00:56:33.364
l really wanted to treat you
and just say thank you...


881
00:56:33.448 --> 00:56:37.577
for all your hard work
and your improvement and-


882
00:56:37.703 --> 00:56:39.704
But l am okay if you want to-
No, no.


883
00:56:39.788 --> 00:56:43.416
l will suffer through it.

884
00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.376
l appreciate that.

885
00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:48.671
ls-ls this technically a date?

886
00:56:48.755 --> 00:56:52.884
Well, you could say that.
l mean, we are out in public,
and people can see us.


887
00:56:52.968 --> 00:56:55.720
So would it be inappropriate
if I were to reach over...


888
00:56:56.805 --> 00:57:00.391
and tuck your hair
behind your ear like that?


889
00:57:00.475 --> 00:57:03.227
Would that be something
that was acceptable
on a night like this?


890
00:57:03.312 --> 00:57:06.230
l suppose
that would be okay.


891
00:57:06.315 --> 00:57:08.357
And what about
if I told you...


892
00:57:08.442 --> 00:57:10.026
that you look beautiful
this evening?


893
00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:11.277
Would that be-

894
00:57:11.403 --> 00:57:13.237
l-l-
Would that be-


895
00:57:13.322 --> 00:57:15.740
No. I
-I would be, um-

896
00:57:16.825 --> 00:57:18.492
l'd be okay
with that tonight.


897
00:57:18.577 --> 00:57:19.660
Okay.

898
00:57:19.745 --> 00:57:22.455
And l might even...

899
00:57:22.539 --> 00:57:25.333
go so far as
to tell you that...


900
00:57:26.501 --> 00:57:30.129
when you want to,
you can be quite handsome...


901
00:57:30.214 --> 00:57:33.132
and extremely charming.

902
00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:38.095
- Well, l want to.
- Okay.


903
00:57:46.521 --> 00:57:48.481
Something to drink!

904
00:57:51.652 --> 00:57:53.861
- Nice. Hey, hey!
- Hey!


905
00:57:53.946 --> 00:57:55.863
Another round?
Another round.


906
00:57:55.948 --> 00:57:58.199
Oh, my goodness.
We are out of control.


907
00:57:58.283 --> 00:58:00.159
This shit is good.

908
00:58:00.285 --> 00:58:02.161
lt's delicious.
I told you.


909
00:58:02.246 --> 00:58:04.580
l gotta pee.

910
00:58:04.706 --> 00:58:07.291
You go pee.
You'll be all right.
Okay, l'll be back.


911
00:58:07.376 --> 00:58:09.752
We'll save your place.
We'll save your spot.


912
00:58:09.878 --> 00:58:12.463
Hey, you want one?
No, I'm good, man.
I don't drink.


913
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:14.882
You sure?
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks though.


914
00:58:14.967 --> 00:58:17.843
Ηey, is that-
is that your TT outside?


915
00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:21.389
lt is.
Man, I gotta
check that thing out, dude.


916
00:58:21.515 --> 00:58:23.849
Let's go.
Let's go.


917
00:58:23.976 --> 00:58:25.851
Open her up.
Let's go.


918
00:58:25.978 --> 00:58:28.104
Go, go, go!

919
00:58:28.188 --> 00:58:29.188
Whoo!

920
00:58:29.273 --> 00:58:31.440
Mick?

921
00:58:31.525 --> 00:58:34.360
Are you serious?

922
00:58:45.539 --> 00:58:47.957
You ever get tired
of the imaginary stuff?


923
00:58:48.041 --> 00:58:50.418
You want a real...

924
00:58:50.544 --> 00:58:54.505
house and kids
and... husband?
I'll have that someday.


925
00:58:54.631 --> 00:58:56.215
Yeah?
Sure.


926
00:58:56.341 --> 00:58:58.217
When?
Well, I think when l'm-
when I'm ready.


927
00:58:58.302 --> 00:59:02.346
As a matter of fact,
I actually think that
I am a lot like you.


928
00:59:03.515 --> 00:59:05.141
How's that?

929
00:59:05.225 --> 00:59:08.728
l think there's a life l was living
that I didn't want.


930
00:59:08.812 --> 00:59:12.440
And until I can figure out
exactly what I want,


931
00:59:12.524 --> 00:59:16.694
l think this substitute life is,
um, is not so bad.


932
00:59:16.778 --> 00:59:19.238
l get it.

933
00:59:21.616 --> 00:59:25.244
Τo icon.

934
00:59:26.413 --> 00:59:27.872
lcon.

935
00:59:29.041 --> 00:59:33.169
l just like saying it.
Icon. Icon.


936
00:59:33.253 --> 00:59:35.921
lcon, icon, icon.

937
00:59:37.591 --> 00:59:40.092
Does it have an effect
on you in any way?


938
00:59:44.389 --> 00:59:47.767
Yeah! Whoo!
That's it. Open it up.


939
00:59:50.103 --> 00:59:51.771
Here we go.

940
00:59:51.855 --> 00:59:54.148
What'd I tell you-
This thing's awesome!


941
00:59:55.650 --> 00:59:57.568
Go, go, go.
Make this light.
Make this light.


942
01:00:11.416 --> 01:00:14.335
My baby.
I could get used to this, man.


943
01:00:14.461 --> 01:00:16.629
Absolutely.
Appreciate it.


944
01:00:16.755 --> 01:00:19.548
Yeah, no problem.
That was great.
You're pretty cool, Mick.


945
01:00:19.674 --> 01:00:21.675
Τhanks.
Yeah.


946
01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:24.762
So, uh, anyone home?

947
01:00:24.846 --> 01:00:28.808
- No, my parents
are out of town.
- Yeah.


948
01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:31.394
What a night, man.

949
01:00:33.146 --> 01:00:35.398
- What the hell, man?
- I'm sorry. I just thought-


950
01:00:35.482 --> 01:00:38.192
Get the fuck away from me!
You son of a fucking bitch!


951
01:00:38.318 --> 01:00:39.777
Bitch.
Fuck!


952
01:00:39.903 --> 01:00:41.821
Listen, man. l didn't-
Fuck you!


953
01:00:41.905 --> 01:00:44.031
Shut the fuck up,
you faggot!


954
01:00:44.116 --> 01:00:45.616
I thought you
were down for it.


955
01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:48.869
Fucking-

956
01:01:03.718 --> 01:01:05.386
Maybe we should
stay in tonight.


957
01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:08.180
This doesn't make sense.

958
01:01:08.265 --> 01:01:10.683
lt just keeps saying that all
of our cards are unbalanced.


959
01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:12.309
You did make the payments,
didn't you?


960
01:01:12.394 --> 01:01:14.645
l'm sure it's just a mistake.
I'll straighten it out.


961
01:01:14.729 --> 01:01:17.231
These cards
are my foundation, Larry.
I need them for the gala.


962
01:01:17.315 --> 01:01:19.567
l've got stuff to pay for.
How am I supposed to do that?


963
01:01:19.693 --> 01:01:22.361
The linens,
the bartenders, the gazebo.
All right. l'll take care of it.


964
01:01:22.446 --> 01:01:25.197
Don't worry. Don't worry.
Don't worry?


965
01:01:25.282 --> 01:01:28.242
Larry, you did not make
the house payment last month.


966
01:01:28.326 --> 01:01:30.578
Why would you tell me
that I don't need to worry?


967
01:01:32.581 --> 01:01:35.124
Seriously,
you gotta fix this today.


968
01:01:35.208 --> 01:01:37.251
Do you understand me?

969
01:02:03.862 --> 01:02:07.031
- Mr. Jones?
- Yes.


970
01:02:08.116 --> 01:02:10.409
l'm Detective Gardner,
Third Precinct.


971
01:02:10.535 --> 01:02:13.454
I'd like to have
a word with you.
Oh. Well, okay.


972
01:02:13.538 --> 01:02:16.248
lt seems like
there was a party
near here last night...


973
01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:19.585
where some alcohol
was being served to minors.


974
01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:23.547
Now, some of the kids said
that your son Mick
brought the alcohol.


975
01:02:23.632 --> 01:02:25.549
Oh, no, no. That's-
That's impossible.


976
01:02:25.634 --> 01:02:27.760
ls everything all right?

977
01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:31.305
You know a young lady
by the name of Naomi Madsen?


978
01:02:31.389 --> 01:02:33.766
Yeah, she's a friend
of our son's.


979
01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:36.227
She left the party drunk
and got in a car accident.


980
01:02:36.353 --> 01:02:38.437
Oh, my God.
Oh, shit.
ls she okay?


981
01:02:38.522 --> 01:02:41.106
She'll be all right.
Could have been worse.


982
01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:44.610
Right now,
l'm concerned about where
that alcohol came from.


983
01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:46.111
ls your son home?

984
01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:48.822
Uh, no. He left
about half an hour ago.


985
01:02:48.907 --> 01:02:51.575
But l-l could try him
on his cell.


986
01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:54.328
- Please.
- Thank you, honey.


987
01:02:56.957 --> 01:02:58.874
ls that a cop?

988
01:02:58.959 --> 01:03:00.834
Yes, it is.

989
01:03:00.961 --> 01:03:03.420
What happened
to your face?
It's nothing.


990
01:03:03.547 --> 01:03:06.966
What's going on out there?
We're trying
to save your ass.


991
01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:09.385
So why don't you
just get upstairs
and stay out of sight?


992
01:03:09.469 --> 01:03:11.011
What?

993
01:03:13.557 --> 01:03:15.474
From father to father,

994
01:03:15.559 --> 01:03:17.851
I trust you're gonna
deal with your son
appropriately, right?


995
01:03:17.978 --> 01:03:20.729
Ooh, l'm gonna deal
with him appropriately.
Okay.


996
01:03:20.814 --> 01:03:23.399
I just got his voice mail.

997
01:03:23.483 --> 01:03:27.570
But, um, he's very good about
checking in, so I'm sure
we'll hear from him.


998
01:03:27.654 --> 01:03:29.905
Just to let you know,
these cases often result...


999
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:32.658
in some sort
of civil liability.


1000
01:03:32.784 --> 01:03:35.244
You may want
to be prepared.
Thank you for the tip.


1001
01:03:35.328 --> 01:03:36.287
Yeah.
Sir.


1002
01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:38.247
Appreciate that.
Yeah.
Nice meeting you.


1003
01:03:38.331 --> 01:03:40.165
Detective.
Thank you.


1004
01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:50.342
What are we supposed to do now?
Ηas anything like this
ever happened before?


1005
01:03:50.427 --> 01:03:52.386
So what's going on?

1006
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:54.722
Naomi Madsen's
in the hospital.


1007
01:03:54.848 --> 01:03:57.391
She got drunk and got
into an accident.
Is she okay?


1008
01:03:57.475 --> 01:03:59.560
lt sounds like
she's gonna be okay.


1009
01:03:59.644 --> 01:04:02.396
- l want all of that punch
out of here immediately.
- Don't worry. It's gone.


1010
01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.106
l can't believe
you gave it to minors.


1011
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:08.652
- lt's my job. Who do you
think drinks that stuff?
- That's not the point.


1012
01:04:08.737 --> 01:04:10.446
Weren't you with her
at the party?


1013
01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:14.116
You must have seen
she couldn't drive.
Why didn't you take her home?


1014
01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.827
- l didn't know
she was that drunk.
- Some friend you are.


1015
01:04:16.911 --> 01:04:18.412
Shut up, Jenn.
I wasn't even there.


1016
01:04:18.538 --> 01:04:21.123
Then where were you?
I took a ride.


1017
01:04:21.207 --> 01:04:23.042
Oh, so you were
driving drunk as well.


1018
01:04:23.126 --> 01:04:24.710
- No. Tim drove.
- Who's Tim?


1019
01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:28.297
- Tim.
- Isn't that Naomi's brother?


1020
01:04:28.381 --> 01:04:30.716
So you both left her?
Why would you do
something like that?


1021
01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.843
No, no, no.

1022
01:04:32.927 --> 01:04:34.428
l got it.

1023
01:04:34.554 --> 01:04:37.306
You were hitting
on the wrong guy-
Fuck you!


1024
01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:39.558
Oh, my God.
I knew it.


1025
01:04:39.684 --> 01:04:41.769
Thank you for that.

1026
01:04:43.438 --> 01:04:46.607
You know what? Screw it.
l shouldn't have to hide
this shit anymore.


1027
01:04:46.733 --> 01:04:48.400
l'm gay.

1028
01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.196
At least l'm not a slut.

1029
01:04:53.448 --> 01:04:56.450
So
-So, what?

1030
01:04:56.534 --> 01:04:58.535
l'm sorry to spoil
the coming-out party
here, guys.


1031
01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:01.246
- l've got
someplace to be.
- Where are you going?


1032
01:05:01.331 --> 01:05:03.832
No, no, no.
We all need to get
on the same page here.


1033
01:05:03.917 --> 01:05:06.669
l don't care what page
you guys are on.


1034
01:05:06.753 --> 01:05:08.337
I'm gonna go see
my boyfriend.


1035
01:05:08.421 --> 01:05:10.297
And while we're
alI sharing here,


1036
01:05:10.382 --> 01:05:12.174
it's Alex Bayner.

1037
01:05:12.258 --> 01:05:15.678
- Melanie's husband?
- Yeah.


1038
01:05:17.764 --> 01:05:19.473
Alex Bayner.
This family's fucked up.


1039
01:05:19.557 --> 01:05:22.643
- Where did we go wrong?
- We're finished.


1040
01:05:22.727 --> 01:05:25.104
lt's gonna get around
that Jenn's out of control.


1041
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:27.690
We've got the police
asking about Mick.
But there's-


1042
01:05:27.774 --> 01:05:29.358
The company
doesn't tolerate
this kind of thing.


1043
01:05:29.484 --> 01:05:31.902
Ηey, come on.
And I am responsible
for this unit.


1044
01:05:31.986 --> 01:05:33.529
No, we will figure
this out together.


1045
01:05:33.613 --> 01:05:36.323
Τhere is no "we," Steve.

1046
01:05:40.912 --> 01:05:43.288
l have to go now
and file a report.


1047
01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.711
Me.

1048
01:05:48.837 --> 01:05:51.296
lt's natural
that a family has problems.
We're not a family.


1049
01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:56.051
A unit?

1050
01:06:24.998 --> 01:06:26.915
Knock, knock.

1051
01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:30.794
Hey, sexy.

1052
01:06:30.879 --> 01:06:34.131
You hiding from me
down there?


1053
01:06:34.215 --> 01:06:36.216
l'm waiting.

1054
01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:40.429
Looking for someone?

1055
01:06:40.513 --> 01:06:43.223
What are you doing here?

1056
01:06:43.308 --> 01:06:45.184
lt is my boat.

1057
01:06:52.525 --> 01:06:55.110
He doesn't love you.
Oh.


1058
01:06:55.195 --> 01:06:59.031
Well, aren't you something?
You poor girl.

You actually think
you're special.


1060
01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:04.787
He's met dozens
of girls like you.


1061
01:07:04.871 --> 01:07:06.622
You're a plaything.

Ηe doesn't want anything
to do with you.

KC. Τhat's a surprise.

1102
01:11:48.613 --> 01:11:50.697
Kate didn't mention
you coming by today.


1103
01:11:50.823 --> 01:11:52.949
l'm here to see you.
Really?


1104
01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:55.994
Okay.

1105
01:11:59.665 --> 01:12:02.501
I've got good news.
Yeah?


1106
01:12:02.585 --> 01:12:05.587
Your numbers have
gone through the roof.


1107
01:12:05.671 --> 01:12:08.965
We're aware of some of
the issues in this cell,


1108
01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:11.843
and we think
you could do better
in a different cell-


1109
01:12:11.928 --> 01:12:13.845
an icon cell.

1110
01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:17.724
Well, uh, look,
I appreciate the offer,


1111
01:12:17.809 --> 01:12:20.060
but I think this family
can make icon status together.


1112
01:12:20.144 --> 01:12:21.394
They're holding you back.

1113
01:12:21.479 --> 01:12:24.189
You need a better team
around you.


1114
01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:25.982
l know you like her.

1115
01:12:26.067 --> 01:12:29.027
lt's her job
to make you like her.


1116
01:12:29.112 --> 01:12:32.906
She's a businesswoman,
and she's ambitious.


1117
01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:35.283
Don't think for a minute...

1118
01:12:35.368 --> 01:12:40.288
she wouldn't leap at this
opportunity and leave you.


1119
01:12:40.373 --> 01:12:44.251
What do you think happened
to the last husband...


1120
01:12:44.335 --> 01:12:47.879
when she got offered
this job?


1121
01:12:52.593 --> 01:12:54.302
l appreciate it. l do.

1122
01:12:54.387 --> 01:12:56.471
But l think I've got
a good team around me,


1123
01:12:56.556 --> 01:13:00.725
and l'd like to try
to make it work with them.


1124
01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:13.655
So where are you gonna go
for vacation? Really.


1125
01:13:14.866 --> 01:13:17.993
l haven't decided yet. You?

1126
01:13:18.119 --> 01:13:20.412
Kenya.

1127
01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:23.915
No. l'm gonna go to Arizona,
visit my old man.


1128
01:13:26.085 --> 01:13:28.170
That's nice.
Yeah.


1129
01:13:29.213 --> 01:13:31.381
l'd like you
to come with me.


1130
01:13:33.801 --> 01:13:36.303
What do you say?

1131
01:13:36.387 --> 01:13:39.181
l say
let me think about it.


1132
01:13:41.267 --> 01:13:44.269
You know what's
really crazy?
What?


1133
01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:46.354
l don't even know
your real last name.


1134
01:13:49.692 --> 01:13:54.696
Well, a girl's gotta have
her secrets, doesn't she?


1135
01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:56.781
Can l buy a vowel?

1136
01:13:58.034 --> 01:14:01.453

No, thank you.

1156
01:14:55.633 --> 01:14:58.260
...for all skin types
that are concerned about
the signs of aging.


1157
01:14:58.386 --> 01:15:00.679
What?
She's furious at me.


1158

Τhis moisturizing formula

1159

She is beautiful,

1160
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:08.603
Yeah.

1161
01:15:10.731 --> 01:15:14.442

l just wanted her
to be happy.


1162
01:15:15.987 --> 01:15:17.279
Well, she is happy.

1163
01:15:17.363 --> 01:15:20.073
Just look at her.
You two have a great life.


1164
01:15:21.867 --> 01:15:23.827
You don't know
about my life.


1165
01:15:23.911 --> 01:15:25.829
You have everything.

1166
01:15:25.913 --> 01:15:30.166
...proven to retard
the signs of photo-aging.


1167
01:15:30.251 --> 01:15:33.253
Wait till she finds out

1168

I have samples for everyone.
Don't be shy.


1169

What?

1170
01:15:38.092 --> 01:15:39.467
That's right.

1171
01:15:39.552 --> 01:15:41.553
Can you say "foreclosure"?

1172
01:15:41.679 --> 01:15:44.097
Yeah, but, Larry,
you're doing so well.


1173
01:15:44.181 --> 01:15:46.099
You're buying
all this stuff.


1174
01:15:48.019 --> 01:15:50.770
Yeah. lt's bigger
than yours, isn't it?


1175
01:15:50.855 --> 01:15:53.898
ls that why you
can't pay your bills?


1176
01:15:53.983 --> 01:15:56.318
Are you jealous?

1177
01:15:56.402 --> 01:16:00.447
ls there any way that you can
return some of this stuff
to pay down your mortgage?


1178
01:16:00.531 --> 01:16:03.867
That's it.
You're jealous of me. Huh?


1179
01:16:03.951 --> 01:16:08.330
You, uh- You can't handle
not being the center
of attention for one night.


1180
01:16:08.414 --> 01:16:09.998
ls that it?

1181
01:16:10.082 --> 01:16:12.584
Oh.

1182
01:16:15.338 --> 01:16:18.465
Um, now what I'd
like you all to do-


1183
01:16:18.549 --> 01:16:21.217
Look, you don't understand.

1184
01:16:21.302 --> 01:16:23.678
All my stuff-
I don't pay for it.


1185
01:16:23.763 --> 01:16:26.931
- I don't pay for that stuff.
- Me neither.
Not for six months, right?


1186
01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:29.142
-"Zero payments for six months."
- No, that's not it.


1187
01:16:29.226 --> 01:16:31.728
- Zero payments-
- That's not what I mean.
You don't get it.


1188
01:16:31.812 --> 01:16:34.022
Shh, guys.
She's doing her thing.


1189
01:16:34.106 --> 01:16:37.567
You're supposed to be
paying attention.
You guys are so loud.


1190
01:16:37.693 --> 01:16:40.111
Why don't you
come over and-
You know what?


1191
01:16:40.196 --> 01:16:42.906
Just a minute, sweetie.

1192
01:16:43.032 --> 01:16:45.283
One minute.
Okay.
One- Okay.


1193
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:49.954
Oh.

1194
01:16:50.081 --> 01:16:52.999
What?
Oh, I get it.


1195
01:16:53.125 --> 01:16:56.294
lt's her money?
Oh.


1196

01:21:44.375 --> 01:21:46.542
No, I didn't.

1247
01:21:46.627 --> 01:21:48.628
I lied to him.

1248
01:21:50.172 --> 01:21:53.174
Here's your coat.

1249
01:21:53.258 --> 01:21:56.135
l lied to him.

1250
01:21:57.596 --> 01:22:00.932
l lied to all of you.

1251
01:22:01.058 --> 01:22:04.143
Steve.
I'm not Steve Jones.


1252
01:22:04.269 --> 01:22:06.229
Steve.
That is not my name.


1253
01:22:06.313 --> 01:22:07.647
Holy shit.

1254
01:22:07.731 --> 01:22:09.399
What?

1255
01:22:11.443 --> 01:22:13.986
- This is not my wife.
- Don't. Don't do this.


1256
01:22:14.071 --> 01:22:18.032
- Τhese are not my kids.
- Steve, please.


1257
01:22:18.158 --> 01:22:19.742
Τhat is not my house.
Settle down, Steve.


1258
01:22:19.827 --> 01:22:22.453
No, listen to me, goddamn it.
You all have to listen.


1259
01:22:22.538 --> 01:22:26.666
I get paid to show off
the cars and the clothes.


1260
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:30.503
l get paid lots of money
to lie and pretend
that I'm your friend.


1261
01:22:30.587 --> 01:22:32.046
We have to leave.

1262
01:22:32.131 --> 01:22:35.133
So that people
like all of you-
people like Larry-


1263
01:22:35.217 --> 01:22:38.136
will go out and want to buy
the stuff that I have.


1264
01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:41.180
Me and my perfect family.

1265
01:22:57.364 --> 01:22:59.365
l'm sorry.

1266
01:23:15.007 --> 01:23:17.341
Come on. Let's go.

1267
01:23:17.426 --> 01:23:21.679
Not so fast, sir.
I need to get some
information from you.


1268
01:23:31.732 --> 01:23:33.608
That was
crazy of him.


1269
01:23:33.692 --> 01:23:36.402
lt's gonna be okay.
l promise.
I'll take care of you.


1270
01:23:36.487 --> 01:23:38.571
- Is this accurate?
- Yes, it's accurate.


1271
01:23:38.655 --> 01:23:43.409
We might need to ask you
a few more questions later on.


1272
01:23:43.494 --> 01:23:46.329
l think that's all.
Thank you, Mr. Cerrilla.


1273
01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:53.855
It's time to go, Steve.

1274
01:24:55.315 --> 01:24:57.233
Where'd you take them?

1275
01:24:57.317 --> 01:24:59.235
They've been reassigned.

1276
01:24:59.319 --> 01:25:03.531
She took the deal,
like I told you she would.

Are they gonna find

1322
