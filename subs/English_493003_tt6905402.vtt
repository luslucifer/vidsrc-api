1
00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:27.374
There's still
some key states


2
00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:29.811
that we need
to keep our eyes on.


3
00:00:29.898 --> 00:00:33.511
There's Michigan, Georgia,
Nevada, Iowa.


4
00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:35.382
None of these
states have been called.


5
00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:43.651
...at this hour, Donald Trump is
projected to win North Carolina.


6
00:00:43.738 --> 00:00:46.611
This is a reliably
Republican state,


7
00:00:46.698 --> 00:00:48.221
with the exception of 2008,

8
00:00:48.308 --> 00:00:50.571
when the state
voted for Obama.


9
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:03.802
We just know that
we deserve to be in there,


10
00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:05.325
and not sitting out here.

11
00:01:05.804 --> 00:01:07.936
Hey, yo, listen. Y'all
know why my nickname is Rock?


12
00:01:08.023 --> 00:01:10.156
'Cause you can always
lean on me.


13
00:01:12.898 --> 00:01:14.160
What?

14
00:01:37.052 --> 00:01:39.272
Oh, shit. Listen, listen.

15
00:01:45.017 --> 00:01:48.629
We're gonna get drunk,
we're here to have a good time.


16
00:01:48.716 --> 00:01:50.718
You know what I'm sayin'?

17
00:01:50.805 --> 00:01:56.637
Listen, listen, what's the worst
Instagram account out there?


18
00:01:57.595 --> 00:01:58.726
Who?

19
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:00.641
What's the funniest?

20
00:02:00.728 --> 00:02:03.731
I think that's 'cause
y'all need to see it.


21
00:02:03.818 --> 00:02:07.692
I got the best Instagram
account in the world.


22
00:02:11.913 --> 00:02:13.654
He's like a cornerstone.

23
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:16.744
Yeah, I'm a cornerstone.

24
00:02:17.397 --> 00:02:19.660
Hey man, y'all ordering food
or what?


25
00:02:19.747 --> 00:02:21.271
You hungry?

26
00:02:21.358 --> 00:02:23.838
- You orderin' food?
- If you wanna eat.


27
00:02:23.925 --> 00:02:26.014
- What you wanna eat?
- Are they hungry?


28
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:27.451
Man, don't worry about them.

29
00:02:27.538 --> 00:02:29.931
They in their salad days?
She needs a Coke.


30
00:02:30.018 --> 00:02:32.020
These LA girls, come on, man.
You already know.


31
00:02:32.107 --> 00:02:34.893
- She need a Coke.
- It's very cold.


32
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.024
She's warm!

33
00:02:36.111 --> 00:02:37.548
Here, I got a warm heart.

34
00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:39.854
I can give you my
coat up until the door.


35
00:02:39.941 --> 00:02:40.768
Then I'm gettin' my coat back.

36
00:02:40.855 --> 00:02:42.422
I got a warm heart.

37
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:45.251
I give you the coat
up until the door,


38
00:02:45.338 --> 00:02:47.949
- then I'm gettin' my coat back.
- Hey, hey.


39
00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:50.778
Go talk to him. Go talk to him.
Check this out.


40
00:02:50.865 --> 00:02:52.563
You-you about give up
your coat, for real?


41
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.739
What are you,
like, Prince Charming now?


42
00:02:54.826 --> 00:02:58.220
Guess what? Guess what?
I'm gonna get it back.


43
00:02:58.308 --> 00:02:59.961
- This is some bullshit.
- Turn around.


44
00:03:00.048 --> 00:03:01.398
No, no.

45
00:03:01.485 --> 00:03:02.834
- Oh, damn, Rock!
- No.


46
00:03:03.313 --> 00:03:05.532
- It ain't happening? It ain't happening?
- Nope.


47
00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:07.665
- Nope. Nope.
- This party is fit tonight.


48
00:03:07.752 --> 00:03:09.406
This party is fit.

49
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.279
You want me to
put your jacket on?


50
00:03:18.763 --> 00:03:20.504
I can't even get in there!

51
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:22.636
You just gotta throw it
over my shoulders.


52
00:03:22.723 --> 00:03:24.638
Bootsy Collins!
Yo, Bootsy Collins!


53
00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:29.991
All right, let me get
my jacket back though.


54
00:03:30.296 --> 00:03:31.689
- Somebody might drive by and see me.
- Yeah, that's true.


55
00:03:31.776 --> 00:03:33.821
Yeah, let me
get my jacket back.


56
00:03:33.908 --> 00:03:36.389
When are we getting
in this place, though?


57
00:03:36.476 --> 00:03:37.912
People know me,
you know what I'm saying?


58
00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:40.088
- Free!
Can't be doing that.


59
00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:41.263
Yeah, come on.

60
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:43.440
Yup, yup, yup!

61
00:03:45.703 --> 00:03:47.487
Thank you!

62
00:03:51.056 --> 00:03:52.840
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

63
00:03:56.888 --> 00:03:58.977
You in a rush?
Where you trying to go?


64
00:03:59.064 --> 00:04:01.501
So, are you ready
to get to this club?


65
00:04:01.588 --> 00:04:05.636
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready. Let's do this.


66
00:04:05.723 --> 00:04:08.943
Why are we waiting?
Like, let's do this.


67
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.643
I got you, boss.
Why you in a rush?


68
00:04:16.124 --> 00:04:17.256
What's up?

69
00:04:17.952 --> 00:04:18.910
What's up?

70
00:04:20.955 --> 00:04:22.827
Uh, where your crew?

71
00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:25.395
What do you mean?

72
00:04:25.482 --> 00:04:28.398
I mean, you just
out here alone?


73
00:04:28.528 --> 00:04:30.617
I mean, yeah. I'm good.

74
00:04:32.706 --> 00:04:34.447
This is really good.

75
00:04:34.578 --> 00:04:37.624
I bet. I've never
seen you before.


76
00:04:38.712 --> 00:04:41.236
What, you know
all the girls in LA?


77
00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:43.195
Something like that.

78
00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:43.630
Oh.

79
00:04:44.892 --> 00:04:45.980
Okay, then.

80
00:04:46.807 --> 00:04:48.330
So, you goin' to the Spot?

81
00:04:48.418 --> 00:04:49.201
"Spot"?

82
00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:53.858
- Spot.
- Oh, no, no, no. I already went out.


83
00:04:54.032 --> 00:04:55.425
Where'd you go?

84
00:04:56.991 --> 00:04:59.733
Across the street to that bar.

85
00:05:00.473 --> 00:05:02.606
'Cause I don't like the lines.

86
00:05:02.693 --> 00:05:04.956
Oh, we don't do the lines.

87
00:05:06.392 --> 00:05:08.873
Just tellin' my new friend
that we don't do lines.


88
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.657
What up, Miss Lady?
How you doin'?


89
00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:13.007
- That's Rock.
- I'm Rock.


90
00:05:13.094 --> 00:05:15.967
- Nice to meet you.
- We go straight to the front.


91
00:05:16.054 --> 00:05:17.185
We're good.

92
00:05:17.882 --> 00:05:18.186
We?

93
00:05:19.797 --> 00:05:21.668
Thought it was just you.

94
00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:25.890
Me and my sandwich.
Sorry, my sandwich and I.


95
00:05:26.717 --> 00:05:27.457
We good.

96
00:05:28.414 --> 00:05:28.980
Okay.

97
00:05:30.068 --> 00:05:31.069
Your loss.

98
00:05:31.722 --> 00:05:34.246
- Cass, you comin'?
- I'm comin' right now.


99
00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:37.510
- Enjoy your sandwich.
- Thank you.


100
00:05:38.685 --> 00:05:39.947
Are we doing this
or what?


101
00:05:40.426 --> 00:05:42.472
- Yeah, we doing this.
- What you doin' back there, man?


102
00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:45.649
Huh? Bro!

103
00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:49.087
How come every time I look over,
you on your phone, man?


104
00:05:49.174 --> 00:05:52.133
So what, man?
It's just one state, man.


105
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.701
Come on. We're not going to be
doing this bullshit all night.


106
00:05:54.788 --> 00:05:57.225
We're gonna get in here and we're gonna
have a good fucking time, you hear me?


107
00:05:57.312 --> 00:05:58.488
- Let's rock, Rock.
- Alright, dude.


108
00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:00.620
Let's do it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.


109
00:06:00.707 --> 00:06:02.230
Let's do this. 
Come on, y'all.

110
00:06:02.535 --> 00:06:04.102
- Yeah, let's do this.
- You ain't cold!


111
00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:06.408
You got Cass' jacket.

112
00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:11.196
You look good, though.

113
00:06:11.283 --> 00:06:14.286
You know why you look good?
You don't need a jacket.


114
00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:18.116
- She don't need a jacket 'cause she look good?
- Nope. 'Cause she look good.


115
00:06:18.203 --> 00:06:21.293
Listen, if you had my jacket--
Look, Cass...


116
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.643
I swear to God,
if she had my jacket...


117
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.776
- She'd be--
- We'd be taking all her beauty away!


118
00:06:25.863 --> 00:06:27.952
You know what I'm saying?
She's beautiful!


119
00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:30.345
We be maskin' the beauty.

120
00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:35.481
No, you'd be
keeping her ass warm.


121
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.011
Hey Rock, hold up for
a minute. Rock, Rock, Rock!


122
00:06:44.098 --> 00:06:45.360
All right, all right.

123
00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:46.013
What?

124
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.408
Just hold up! What?

125
00:06:51.018 --> 00:06:53.151
Mimi, just what? What?
Come on.


126
00:06:53.238 --> 00:06:55.153
I'm busy, yeah.
I'm taking care of our son.


127
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.069
That's what I'm doin',
I'm workin'.


128
00:06:58.156 --> 00:06:58.678
What?

129
00:06:59.636 --> 00:07:02.203
Yeah, of course. Put him on.

130
00:07:03.901 --> 00:07:04.554
Man...

131
00:07:08.253 --> 00:07:09.646
What's up, man?

132
00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:12.387
Son, what's up?

133
00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:14.564
What do you mean
you're scared?


134
00:07:14.651 --> 00:07:15.826
You're there with your mother,
I'm here.


135
00:07:15.913 --> 00:07:18.132
I mean, what do you mean?

136
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.310
She's screamin' at the TV?

137
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.270
What did I tell you?
Listen to me, Rumi. Rumi, Rumi.


138
00:07:25.357 --> 00:07:27.098
What did I tell you?

139
00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:29.622
What did I tell you?

140
00:07:29.753 --> 00:07:31.842
It doesn't matter
what happens tonight.


141
00:07:31.929 --> 00:07:33.931
Just, you say it with me.

142
00:07:34.018 --> 00:07:35.106
That I'm...

143
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.240
That's right.
Okay, and what else?


144
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:40.764
Exactly.

145
00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:42.200
And what else?

146
00:07:43.897 --> 00:07:48.075
That I'm a strong, smart,
loving, black man. That's right.


147
00:07:48.162 --> 00:07:51.035
All right. On the count of
three. One, two, three!


148
00:07:51.122 --> 00:07:52.645
One. Two. Three.

149
00:07:53.994 --> 00:07:55.735
Ommm...

150
00:07:58.912 --> 00:08:00.392
All right. So, you better?

151
00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:01.828
- Cass! Come on, man!
- There you go.


152
00:08:02.176 --> 00:08:04.352
- Let's do this!
- Look, go hug your mother.


153
00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:06.441
Tell her we got this. Why?

154
00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:10.358
You tell me why we got this.
Tell Dad why we got this.


155
00:08:10.445 --> 00:08:13.057
Exactly. 'Cause we got this.

156
00:08:14.014 --> 00:08:14.928
All right.

157

00:18:42.729 --> 00:18:45.602
Girl, I run this town. You lucky
I got your ass in the club.


310
00:18:45.689 --> 00:18:48.605
You were sittin' on the curb,
I got you in the club.


311
00:18:48.692 --> 00:18:49.562
Fuck you!

312
00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:52.086
[I tried, remember?

313
00:19:01.139 --> 00:19:02.880
You know what else?

314
00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.316
Fucking shit.

315
00:19:10.061 --> 00:19:10.844
Fuck...

316
00:19:15.501 --> 00:19:16.067
Shit.

317
00:19:26.164 --> 00:19:27.513
Talk to me that way.

318
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.038
Bullshit, I fucking
took care of her.


319
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.529
Yeah!

320
00:19:48.142 --> 00:19:49.056
Oh, shit!

321
00:19:50.362 --> 00:19:51.798
Damn! Hey, hey!

322
00:19:54.497 --> 00:19:56.542
You gotta smile more, girl!
Come on.


323
00:19:56.629 --> 00:19:58.196
Hey, let me get that number.

324
00:19:58.283 --> 00:19:59.893
- Hey, yo, yo!
- Let me get that number!


325
00:20:02.635 --> 00:20:04.942
Yo, yo! Hey!
Get your fucking hands off her!


326
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:07.510
- Chill, chill.
- Your pimp's here now?


327
00:20:07.597 --> 00:20:08.989
Who the fuck do you
think you are?!


328
00:20:09.076 --> 00:20:12.602
Who do you think you are?
Go on, man.


329
00:20:12.732 --> 00:20:15.866
- What the fuck you--
- Stop! Stop!


330
00:20:15.996 --> 00:20:17.955
- Get the fuck off me!
- Hey, fuck you!


331
00:20:18.042 --> 00:20:19.783
Hey, stop!

332
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.045
- Hey!
- What the fuck!


333
00:20:21.132 --> 00:20:22.612
- Fuck off!
- Stop!


334
00:20:22.699 --> 00:20:26.050
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!


335
00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.834
- This dude right here!
- Ma'am, stand back.


336
00:20:27.921 --> 00:20:29.836
- Stand back!
- No! It's not him!


337
00:20:29.923 --> 00:20:32.099
- Okay!
- It's not him, though, it was them!


338
00:20:32.186 --> 00:20:36.190
- Why are you going after him?
- Torres! Torres!


339
00:20:36.321 --> 00:20:37.104
Torres!

340
00:20:38.018 --> 00:20:40.499
The girl says the guys running
attacked her.


341
00:20:40.586 --> 00:20:43.372
Come on, man.

342
00:20:43.459 --> 00:20:46.200
Tell me what happened.
Tell me what happened.


343
00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:48.246
Those guys came up to me
they were trying to hit on me,


344
00:20:48.333 --> 00:20:51.205
they were getting, like,
touchy-grabby, my boy came up,


345
00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:54.034
and he told them, like,
to back up. The dude pushed him.


346
00:20:54.121 --> 00:20:59.518
So when he pushed him, like,
the dude was aggressive first.


347
00:20:59.953 --> 00:21:03.827
- Let's go.
- Come on, man.


348
00:21:34.858 --> 00:21:36.599
- Are you Cass?
- No.


349
00:21:37.382 --> 00:21:39.428
Cass Film, that is you, bro!

350
00:21:39.515 --> 00:21:41.212
Either you or your twin!

351
00:21:41.299 --> 00:21:43.649
- Yo, what happened? You all right?
- Yeah, what's up?


352
00:21:43.736 --> 00:21:46.435
Look, I go to USC.
I got one more year left.


353
00:21:46.522 --> 00:21:49.089
And I promise you,
your film was everything.


354
00:21:49.176 --> 00:21:51.396
You know they still show it
there, right?


355
00:21:51.483 --> 00:21:53.093
So, what's up?

356
00:21:53.224 --> 00:21:57.620
When the feature supposed to
drop, man? We all waitin'!


357
00:21:57.707 --> 00:22:01.145
You look like a bright kid, man.
Keep right, all right?


358
00:22:01.232 --> 00:22:03.930
- Oh, you keepin' it under wraps and shit, huh?
- Yeah.


359
00:22:04.017 --> 00:22:07.238
- All right, man.
- All right.


360
00:22:07.499 --> 00:22:09.936
- Stay in school.
- Indeed!


361
00:22:13.244 --> 00:22:13.679
Hey.

362
00:22:15.638 --> 00:22:16.073
Hey.

363
00:22:20.077 --> 00:22:22.514
- What was that?
- Nothing.


364
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:25.082
- Yo!
- I said nothing.


365
00:22:25.212 --> 00:22:30.174
No, I just-- I heard about,
you did a film or something?


366
00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:32.611
- Can I see it?
- No.


367
00:22:33.525 --> 00:22:35.571
- Why not?
- I said, no!


368
00:22:36.136 --> 00:22:38.269
Look, I'm gonna go back in there
and tell Rock I'm out, OK?


369
00:22:38.356 --> 00:22:40.358
You can stay with him if you want,
he'll take care of you, all right?


370
00:22:40.445 --> 00:22:44.623
I'm not-- No, come here,
come here, come here.


371
00:22:45.494 --> 00:22:45.929
Hey.

372
00:22:49.367 --> 00:22:49.933
What?

373
00:22:53.545 --> 00:22:54.503
Come here.

374
00:23:02.423 --> 00:23:03.773
Come sit down.

375
00:23:04.121 --> 00:23:06.645
Let's just sit for a minute.

376
00:23:09.126 --> 00:23:11.563
Let's just sit down. Come on.

377
00:24:02.658 --> 00:24:03.223
Shit.

378
00:24:19.718 --> 00:24:20.284
Um...

379
00:24:23.243 --> 00:24:25.245
I'm sorry about before.

380
00:24:25.376 --> 00:24:25.985
What?

381
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.293
I said, I'm sorry about before.

382
00:24:30.207 --> 00:24:31.817
You're sorry, what?

383
00:24:31.904 --> 00:24:36.300
I said, I'm sorry about before.
In the bathroom.


384
00:24:39.477 --> 00:24:40.260
It's OK.

385
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:43.655
Hey.

386
00:24:45.396 --> 00:24:46.179
It's OK.

387
00:24:52.925 --> 00:24:55.885
Yeah, you just pulled up right
in front of me.


388
00:24:55.972 --> 00:24:56.973
Where...?

389
00:24:57.408 --> 00:25:00.933
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Where are you going?


390
00:25:01.978 --> 00:25:03.719
Anywhere but here.

391
00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:07.723
You walkin'?

392
00:25:10.073 --> 00:25:10.943
Let's go.

393
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.447
How you all doing?

394
00:25:36.577 --> 00:25:38.362
Oh, man, OK.

395
00:25:39.711 --> 00:25:41.931
It's been a tough night.

396
00:25:55.422 --> 00:25:56.423
Thank you.

397
00:25:59.731 --> 00:26:00.645
For what?

398
00:26:05.041 --> 00:26:08.000
That was, uh...
that was cute.


399
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.265
- Cute?
- Yeah.


400
00:26:13.484 --> 00:26:15.660
I'm a grown-ass man, woman.

401
00:26:15.747 --> 00:26:18.707
Does that mean
you can't be cute?


402
00:26:31.415 --> 00:26:33.896
Home to Detroit, Michigan,

403
00:26:33.983 --> 00:26:36.376
Milwaukee and Wisconsin.

404
00:26:37.943 --> 00:26:40.859
It could impede in what
the polls are saying right now.


405
00:26:40.946 --> 00:26:43.122
Michigan and Wisconsin
are so close.


406
00:26:43.209 --> 00:26:45.908
Um, just a really quick update
right now,


407
00:26:45.995 --> 00:26:50.086
we have Hillary with New Mexico,
Virginia, Colorado, Oregon--


408
00:26:52.262 --> 00:26:54.438
These are all
no surprises:


409
00:26:54.525 --> 00:26:56.745
Hawaii, California,

410
00:27:08.191 --> 00:27:10.933
Thank you for fighting for me.

411
00:27:12.064 --> 00:27:13.022
Thank you.

412
00:27:14.719 --> 00:27:16.286
You're welcome.

413
00:27:17.591 --> 00:27:19.332
The least I could do.

414
00:27:23.075 --> 00:27:24.511
We did not expect this race

415
00:27:24.598 --> 00:27:27.950
to be this close,
that is for sure.


416
00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.778
Brother, you need
some napkins?


417
00:27:29.865 --> 00:27:31.127
I have napkins up here.

418
00:27:31.214 --> 00:27:32.084
I'm fine.

419
00:27:34.565 --> 00:27:36.262
What happened?

420
00:27:36.349 --> 00:27:37.481
Ignorance.

421
00:27:38.787 --> 00:27:40.701
That's what happened.
Let's just...


422
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:43.008
We don't need
to talk about it.


423
00:27:43.095 --> 00:27:46.055
I know all about that one.

424
00:27:46.185 --> 00:27:49.058
What you mean,
you know about all that?


425
00:27:49.145 --> 00:27:51.800
What you know about all what?

426
00:27:53.889 --> 00:27:57.457
My dad is Arabic.
I was raised Muslim, man.


427
00:27:57.588 --> 00:27:59.808
I deal with it every day.

428
00:28:01.331 --> 00:28:03.115
The Arabic part helps you out.

429
00:28:03.202 --> 00:28:04.987
Hmm! Does it?

430
00:28:05.117 --> 00:28:05.944
Trust me.

431
00:28:07.206 --> 00:28:09.121
Yeah, tell that
to my fam, bro.


432
00:28:09.208 --> 00:28:12.429
Yeah, you can't know what's it
like to wake up every...


433
00:28:12.516 --> 00:28:14.257
every day, over and
over and over,


434
00:28:14.344 --> 00:28:17.738
they disrespect you just because
of the color you were born in.


435
00:28:17.826 --> 00:28:19.653
I ain't disrespectin' you.

436
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.872
I'm tellin' you.

437
00:28:20.959 --> 00:28:23.483
The Arabic side helps you out.

438
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:25.442
Black man in America,

439
00:28:25.529 --> 00:28:28.749
you gotta wake up and act like
the shit didn't happen.


440
00:28:28.837 --> 00:28:31.274
So you can't know about it.

441
00:28:33.406 --> 00:28:35.844
Man, my mom's black.

442
00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:43.199
Try being a black man in America
every day, and then, uh..


443
00:28:43.286 --> 00:28:46.115
being put on a terrorist list.

444
00:28:46.202 --> 00:28:50.815
Your, uh, dad being stopped
for no reason, and, uh,


445
00:28:51.685 --> 00:28:55.428
your cousins not being
able to come here.


446
00:28:58.083 --> 00:29:01.608
It's like being
a black man in America.


447
00:29:05.656 --> 00:29:07.397
This shit ain't OK.

448
00:29:08.224 --> 00:29:10.052
Shit ain't OK, man.

449
00:29:10.139 --> 00:29:12.489
No, the fuckin' shit ain't OK.

450
00:29:12.576 --> 00:29:13.011
Hey.

451
00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:17.886
Shit is not OK.

452
00:29:19.278 --> 00:29:20.671
It's fucked up.

453
00:29:21.759 --> 00:29:23.500
But you know what,
it's different.


454
00:29:23.587 --> 00:29:25.154
It's different for you,
it's different for him,


455
00:29:25.241 --> 00:29:27.330
it's different for me.

456
00:29:28.592 --> 00:29:30.072
It's fucked up.

457
00:29:32.204 --> 00:29:32.639
God.

458
00:29:35.251 --> 00:29:36.817
Especially now.

459
00:29:41.474 --> 00:29:43.346
It's fucking crazy.

460
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:47.437
Donald Trump
has always had money.


461
00:29:47.524 --> 00:29:50.570
Do you think-- Listen,
people who are voting for him--


462
00:29:50.657 --> 00:29:53.573
This is for the voters:
he has always had money.


463
00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.881
He has never even known
anybody that is poor,


464
00:29:56.968 --> 00:30:01.059
that's middle-class,
that's working class--


465
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.842
You OK?

466
00:30:04.976 --> 00:30:05.890
I'm fine.

467
00:30:09.241 --> 00:30:12.201
I mean, not really,
but I'm fine.


468
00:30:16.683 --> 00:30:18.337
Just tired as shit.

469
00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:21.210
Same old shit.

470
00:30:21.732 --> 00:30:24.126
Every city, same old shit.

471
00:30:29.827 --> 00:30:30.393
Yeah.

472
00:30:35.354 --> 00:30:37.313
- Yeah.
- And he only cares now


473
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.706
because he wants your vote.

474
00:30:39.837 --> 00:30:41.926
And if he wins tonight,

475
00:30:42.666 --> 00:30:45.799
because of you, you're going
to find out very soon


476
00:30:45.886 --> 00:30:48.977
that his interests
are not yours.


477
00:30:52.067 --> 00:30:53.459
Welcome to L.A.

478
00:30:55.896 --> 00:30:58.334
Shit. Welcome to America.

479
00:30:59.248 --> 00:31:00.684
Yeah, that too.

480
00:31:12.087 --> 00:31:13.653
Trump began
his unlikely bid


481
00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.830
to the White House
in June 2015...


482
00:31:18.354 --> 00:31:19.833
What do you want?

483
00:31:21.966 --> 00:31:22.532
What?

484
00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:27.319
What do you want?
Like, what do you really want?


485
00:31:27.406 --> 00:31:27.972
Uh...

486
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:32.890
I mean, does it really matter,
what I really want?


487
00:31:32.977 --> 00:31:35.414
It's not the movies, so...

488
00:31:36.198 --> 00:31:36.763
What?

489
00:31:38.504 --> 00:31:42.813
I mean, nobody ever gets
what they really want.


490
00:31:43.553 --> 00:31:44.467
Says who?

491
00:31:45.816 --> 00:31:47.905
Who told you that? Society?

492
00:31:47.992 --> 00:31:51.213
Nah, man, it's just there's...

493
00:31:51.343 --> 00:31:53.824
things that I know, and that's
one thing that I know.


494
00:31:53.911 --> 00:31:58.046
And I ask again,
who told you that?


495
00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:00.178
Everybody.

496
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.921
My mom, my sisters, my dad.

497
00:32:04.052 --> 00:32:05.749
I mean, literally everybody.

498
00:32:05.836 --> 00:32:07.229
Yeah, but you said
you were grown.


499
00:32:07.316 --> 00:32:07.925
No. OK.

500
00:32:08.708 --> 00:32:11.711
I am grown.
Let me put it this way.


501
00:32:12.234 --> 00:32:15.237
My mom... she had things
that she wanted to do.


502
00:32:15.324 --> 00:32:18.544
Things that she
was excited about.


503
00:32:18.892 --> 00:32:20.024
She had kids

504
00:32:20.416 --> 00:32:21.330
and then,

505
00:32:21.678 --> 00:32:23.245
we came along and

506
00:32:23.854 --> 00:32:26.639
she ain't get to
do those things.


507
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.555
So, how am I supposed to be
just completely irresponsible


508
00:32:29.642 --> 00:32:31.035
and just go after

509
00:32:31.122 --> 00:32:32.819
something that's crazy, like...

510
00:32:32.906 --> 00:32:33.646
Just...

511
00:32:34.386 --> 00:32:35.779
- Crazy?
- How can you do that?


512
00:32:35.866 --> 00:32:36.997
Yes, crazy.

513
00:32:39.043 --> 00:32:40.349
OK, so what...

514
00:32:41.915 --> 00:32:43.874
What did you go after?

515
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:48.487
I'm a lawyer.

516
00:32:50.359 --> 00:32:51.577
That's nice.

517
00:32:58.758 --> 00:33:00.282
You hate it, huh?

518
00:33:03.372 --> 00:33:05.287
That why you rockin'
the short crop


519
00:33:05.374 --> 00:33:07.027
with the blond hair at the top?

520
00:33:07.115 --> 00:33:09.073
- 'Cause you being rebellious?
- Nah.


521
00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.597
Everybody needs a change.

522
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.298
Even lawyers, huh?

523
00:33:18.474 --> 00:33:19.779
Even lawyers.

524
00:33:25.176 --> 00:33:27.483
What's that look?

525
00:33:28.223 --> 00:33:29.615
It's nothing.

526
00:33:29.702 --> 00:33:32.662
No, it's something.
I mean, it's...


527
00:33:32.749 --> 00:33:34.794
It's like it's different.
Like it changed.


528
00:33:34.881 --> 00:33:36.056
What's that look?

529
00:33:36.144 --> 00:33:37.623
I said it's fine.

530
00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:43.020
No, I'm saying it's different.
Like, I'm, you know...


531
00:33:43.107 --> 00:33:44.500
I'm a film director, so I--

532
00:33:44.587 --> 00:33:46.632
OK, could you just
leave it alone, please?


533
00:33:46.719 --> 00:33:48.243
I said it's fine.

534
00:33:51.159 --> 00:33:51.811
My bad.

535
00:33:54.901 --> 00:33:56.555
I make good money.

536
00:33:56.686 --> 00:33:58.992
I own a condo and I'm able
to take care of my mom,


537
00:33:59.079 --> 00:34:01.734
and she's the one
who supported all of us.


538
00:34:01.821 --> 00:34:03.171
I'm good. I...

539
00:34:03.997 --> 00:34:04.911
OK, so...

540
00:34:06.652 --> 00:34:10.221
You got money in the bank.
That's dope.


541
00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:12.876
What do you mean by that?

542
00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:15.661
Like I said, it's dope.

543
00:34:15.792 --> 00:34:18.664
You still didn't answer
my question, though.


544
00:34:18.751 --> 00:34:20.275
Yes, I did.

545
00:34:20.405 --> 00:34:21.928
No, you didn't. I asked you
what you really want.


546
00:34:22.015 --> 00:34:26.150
And I said nobody ever gets
what they really want.


547
00:34:36.247 --> 00:34:37.901
That ain't my life.

548
00:34:38.858 --> 00:34:39.207
Oh.

549
00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.602
So, what? What, you went
after the dream?


550
00:34:43.689 --> 00:34:45.604
You went after what
you really wanted, so...


551
00:34:45.691 --> 00:34:46.953
- Yeah
- I mean, what now?


552
00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.564
I'm going after mine.

553
00:34:48.651 --> 00:34:49.826
What you mean, "what now?"
I'm going after mine.


554
00:34:49.913 --> 00:34:50.696
Are you?

555
00:34:51.393 --> 00:34:51.958
Yeah.

556
00:34:53.525 --> 00:34:54.091
What?

557
00:34:55.614 --> 00:34:56.485
Nothing.

558
00:34:57.703 --> 00:34:58.791
Hmm.

559
00:35:07.539 --> 00:35:10.194
What do you really want to be?

560
00:35:11.804 --> 00:35:12.152
I--

561
00:35:13.676 --> 00:35:15.982
Go ahead. I'm listening.

562
00:35:18.376 --> 00:35:18.942
Uh...

563
00:35:21.901 --> 00:35:23.294
At one point...

564
00:35:24.164 --> 00:35:25.818
I wanted to be a DJ.

565
00:35:27.864 --> 00:35:30.475
You made me laugh.

566
00:35:30.606 --> 00:35:34.392
- I made you laugh?
- No, I mean, in a good way.


567
00:35:34.479 --> 00:35:35.698
That's cool.

568
00:35:36.176 --> 00:35:38.135
- Word. A DJ.
- Like...


569
00:35:39.136 --> 00:35:41.486
No, seriously though, like...

570
00:35:41.573 --> 00:35:44.620
At all of my, like, little get-togethers
with my family and stuff,


571
00:35:44.707 --> 00:35:46.491
I like to pull out
my Bluetooth speaker,


572
00:35:46.578 --> 00:35:48.101
and like... I don't know.

573
00:35:48.188 --> 00:35:50.234
- Like what?
- Just...


574
00:35:50.365 --> 00:35:53.411
- Like what?
- Make people feel something.


575
00:35:53.498 --> 00:35:54.499
You know?

576
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:55.587
Move them.

577
00:35:57.154 --> 00:35:58.721
Make them think.

578
00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:02.507
Or just have fun
for a little while.


579
00:36:03.203 --> 00:36:05.293
Music does that for me.

580
00:36:06.206 --> 00:36:08.339
Film does that for me.

581
00:36:11.429 --> 00:36:12.212
TouchÃ©.

582
00:36:16.042 --> 00:36:18.610
Well...
I don't know, you got...


583
00:36:18.697 --> 00:36:20.308
a playlist? Spotify?

584
00:36:20.395 --> 00:36:21.744
What?

585
00:36:22.135 --> 00:36:23.180
Come on, you're old-school.
You got a mix-tape, right?


586
00:36:23.267 --> 00:36:23.833
What?

587
00:36:25.313 --> 00:36:27.140
- Nah, man.
- Yo, Naqeeb!


588
00:36:27.227 --> 00:36:28.968
- That's your name, right?
- Yeah.


589
00:36:29.055 --> 00:36:29.621
Um...

590
00:36:31.014 --> 00:36:32.189
We got a DJ back here.

591
00:36:32.276 --> 00:36:33.277
- Word?
- Yo.


592
00:36:33.364 --> 00:36:34.757
- Yo!
- She got a mix-tape.


593
00:36:34.844 --> 00:36:36.585
I do not have a mix-tape!

594
00:36:36.672 --> 00:36:38.282
Let me--
Let me hear it!


595
00:36:38.369 --> 00:36:41.894
I know you got headphones in
that purse, too. Come on.


596
00:36:41.981 --> 00:36:43.940
Once a DJ, always a DJ.

597
00:36:44.462 --> 00:36:45.420
Let it rip.

598
00:36:48.336 --> 00:36:49.902
- Hold that.
- OK.


599
00:36:53.689 --> 00:36:54.690
All right.

600
00:36:55.821 --> 00:36:59.085
These things don't usually
do well with my ears.


601
00:36:59.172 --> 00:37:00.696
- Well...
- I got little ears, but...


602
00:37:00.783 --> 00:37:02.785
- Do you?
- Yeah, I do got little ears,


603
00:37:02.872 --> 00:37:05.614
but hopefully your music
is big.


604
00:37:05.744 --> 00:37:07.093
Oh, God...

605
00:37:07.442 --> 00:37:09.313
- OK.
- All right. Let me know what you think.


606
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.053
I'm in.

607
00:37:10.445 --> 00:37:12.360
- You're in?
- I'm in.


608
00:37:14.187 --> 00:37:16.973
You go to the song
you want me to...


609
00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.496
Uh... That one.

610
00:37:19.541 --> 00:37:20.629
There we go.

611
00:37:23.327 --> 00:37:24.241
For real?

612
00:37:26.374 --> 00:37:27.287
For real?

613
00:37:31.814 --> 00:37:32.118
Yo!

614
00:37:34.773 --> 00:37:35.513
Lawyer?

615
00:37:36.384 --> 00:37:37.385
Whatever.

616
00:37:39.343 --> 00:37:39.909
Damn!

617
00:37:43.956 --> 00:37:45.958
What's your DJ name?

618
00:37:46.089 --> 00:37:46.655
What?

619
00:37:47.699 --> 00:37:49.571
I ain't got a DJ name.

620
00:37:50.833 --> 00:37:52.400
Yo, this is hot!

621
00:37:59.015 --> 00:38:01.974
Your mama know
you're this good?


622
00:38:02.192 --> 00:38:03.106
Exactly.

623
00:38:14.726 --> 00:38:15.031
Yo.

624
00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.128
Hmm.

625
00:38:31.177 --> 00:38:34.398
- Yeah, this is it, man.
- OK.


626
00:38:34.529 --> 00:38:35.747
That's good.

627
00:38:42.362 --> 00:38:44.756
That's dope.

628
00:38:44.843 --> 00:38:45.409
Yeah?

629
00:38:47.846 --> 00:38:48.804
What's up?

630
00:38:50.806 --> 00:38:53.112
What? You didn't like it?

631
00:38:55.419 --> 00:38:58.161
Nah, it's incredible.

632
00:39:16.875 --> 00:39:19.878
No, I mean, it was
incredible. Honestly.


633
00:39:19.965 --> 00:39:21.663
I just, you know...

634
00:39:22.751 --> 00:39:24.709
- My phone.
- I real-- Yeah.


635
00:39:24.796 --> 00:39:26.581
- Right.
- You got a whole life back home,


636
00:39:26.668 --> 00:39:29.192
and, look,
this is borrowed time.


637
00:39:29.279 --> 00:39:32.587
OK... Look, I'm not
with him anymore.


638
00:39:32.717 --> 00:39:34.806
It's-- It's none of
my business.


639
00:39:34.893 --> 00:39:37.940
Oh, so you're not
seeing someone?


640
00:39:38.767 --> 00:39:40.464
Yeah, I'm seeing everyone.

641
00:39:40.551 --> 00:39:44.512
Oh, come on, man, don't be
like that. I saw you earlier.


642
00:39:44.599 --> 00:39:46.601
I saw you on your phone
when I was walking up,


643
00:39:46.688 --> 00:39:49.212
and you sounded like
you were all in love.


644
00:39:49.299 --> 00:39:49.865
Yeah.

645
00:39:50.779 --> 00:39:53.521
What? Now you don't remember?

646
00:39:55.392 --> 00:39:56.001
Oh, OK.

647
00:39:56.915 --> 00:39:59.527
But it's funny when you do it.

648
00:39:59.918 --> 00:40:00.484
Rumi.

649
00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:05.794
Rumi is my son.
He's five years old.


650
00:40:06.664 --> 00:40:06.969
Oh.

651
00:40:08.884 --> 00:40:11.451
Look, I understand that--

652
00:40:11.582 --> 00:40:15.194
No, I don't think
you do understand.


653
00:40:15.325 --> 00:40:18.415
You fought for me
the first day we met.


654
00:40:18.546 --> 00:40:20.548
And he's only ever...

655
00:40:21.287 --> 00:40:22.332
fought me.

656
00:40:23.115 --> 00:40:27.685
And he's only fighting
for me now because I'm gone.


657
00:40:45.877 --> 00:40:47.836
Oh, my God, that view.

658
00:40:49.751 --> 00:40:50.969
Look at this.

659
00:40:53.755 --> 00:40:54.190
Ohh!

660
00:41:11.381 --> 00:41:12.382
So pretty.

661
00:41:22.522 --> 00:41:26.265
- It's so quiet up here, eh?
- Yeah.


662
00:41:28.746 --> 00:41:29.704
Thank you.

663
00:41:33.403 --> 00:41:33.838
Hmm.

664
00:41:39.322 --> 00:41:40.715
Look up.

665
00:41:44.414 --> 00:41:46.068
Oh, my God.

666
00:41:47.896 --> 00:41:49.462
It's a full moon.

667
00:41:49.811 --> 00:41:51.073
Shit.

668
00:41:51.377 --> 00:41:54.250
Like a record.

669
00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:56.165
Yeah.

670
00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.255
Maybe it's a sign.

671
00:41:59.342 --> 00:42:01.561
Maybe it is a sign.

672
00:42:06.088 --> 00:42:06.523
Hmm.

673
00:42:07.045 --> 00:42:08.568
God likes music too.

674
00:42:08.656 --> 00:42:11.441
Oh, God loves music.

675
00:42:26.761 --> 00:42:28.545
Wait. Where are we?

676
00:42:30.808 --> 00:42:32.723
A friend's house.

677
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:35.465
Find ourselves here a lot.

678
00:42:35.595 --> 00:42:37.641
After these kind of nights,
you know?


679
00:42:37.728 --> 00:42:39.382
Mm-hmm.

680
00:42:39.512 --> 00:42:41.950
Let's go check it out.

681
00:42:42.037 --> 00:42:44.343
- Let's do it.
- OK.


682
00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:56.878
Ah.

683
00:43:04.233 --> 00:43:06.191
Oh, thank you.

684
00:43:17.246 --> 00:43:18.595
This is it.

685
00:43:18.682 --> 00:43:20.118
Let's go in. Oh!

686
00:43:28.257 --> 00:43:30.085
Uh, anybody in here?

687
00:43:31.477 --> 00:43:35.046
- Hey, what's up, Cass?
- You got it.


688
00:43:35.177 --> 00:43:37.092
What's good with it?

689
00:43:37.179 --> 00:43:38.833
- You all right?
- All good, man.


690
00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.182
This is Free.

691
00:43:40.269 --> 00:43:43.141
How you doing?
Nice to meet you too.


692
00:43:44.882 --> 00:43:47.015
Donald Trump
absolutely needed it.


693
00:43:47.102 --> 00:43:48.756
He got it and now,
as we talked about,


694
00:43:48.843 --> 00:43:52.237
he has many different ways
to get to the 270 votes he needs


695
00:43:52.324 --> 00:43:55.937
to be the next
President of the United States.


696
00:43:56.024 --> 00:43:57.590
Clinton County had a surge

697
00:43:57.677 --> 00:43:59.462
of Latino voters
in the state of Florida.


698
00:43:59.549 --> 00:44:02.334
Looks like they actually did get
an increase in Latino turnout,


699
00:44:02.421 --> 00:44:04.032
but it wasn't enough.

700
00:44:04.119 --> 00:44:05.468
In Wisconsin
and, earlier in the night,


701
00:44:05.555 --> 00:44:08.036
Michigan was blue,
and now they're undecided


702
00:44:08.123 --> 00:44:09.341
and they're leaning
towards Trump


703
00:44:09.428 --> 00:44:11.256
and so, that's a big upset,

704
00:44:11.343 --> 00:44:14.477
stating that,
you know, Michigan...


705
00:44:14.607 --> 00:44:18.350
Uh... I didn't expect
for this to be so...


706
00:44:23.268 --> 00:44:24.922
Hey, guys.

707
00:44:27.446 --> 00:44:30.710
But, thing is, if he keeps
winning this, mathematically,


708
00:44:30.798 --> 00:44:32.538
she can't beat this shit out!

709
00:44:32.625 --> 00:44:35.933
But she-- He can't win.
I mean that-- I mean...


710
00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.195
Come on.

711
00:44:37.326 --> 00:44:39.502
But I mean, if they--
Who didn't vote?


712
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:43.723
Like, who sat at home and
skipped out on this election?


713
00:44:43.811 --> 00:44:45.160
'Cause I voted.

714
00:44:45.247 --> 00:44:47.815
You're right. We all voted.

715
00:44:48.598 --> 00:44:52.994
If she loses Pennsylvania,
it's a fucking wrap.


716
00:44:54.256 --> 00:44:57.389
Radio silence in Brooklyn
right now at Clinton's party.


717
00:44:57.476 --> 00:45:00.610
A place that was jubilant
and excited just hours ago,


718
00:45:00.697 --> 00:45:02.612
now you can hear a pin drop.

719
00:45:02.699 --> 00:45:04.744
That is not a good sign
for the Clinton camp.


720
00:45:04.832 --> 00:45:07.138
I can only imagine
the devastation


721
00:45:07.225 --> 00:45:11.490
going through Hillary Clinton's
mind right now...


722
00:45:23.763 --> 00:45:25.504
We can leave if you want,
you know.


723
00:45:25.591 --> 00:45:27.028
No, no, it's OK.

724
00:45:27.811 --> 00:45:29.160
- Sure?
- Yeah.


725
00:45:29.552 --> 00:45:33.338
All right. I'm gonna go...
make us a drink.


726
00:45:33.469 --> 00:45:34.862
- OK
- All right.


727
00:45:37.125 --> 00:45:40.824
- Whiskey? Wine?
- Wine. Something. Champagne.


728
00:45:40.911 --> 00:45:42.260
We just heard
the list of states


729
00:45:42.347 --> 00:45:43.914
where Hillary Clinton
would have to win


730
00:45:44.001 --> 00:45:47.483
all those states
to have any chance...


731
00:45:47.962 --> 00:45:48.919
What's up?

732
00:45:50.268 --> 00:45:51.791
Good to see y'all, man.

733
00:45:51.879 --> 00:45:53.532
- What's up, man?
- Got it.


734
00:45:53.619 --> 00:45:54.838
What's up, K?

735
00:45:54.925 --> 00:45:56.361
- Good to see you, my man.
- You good?


736
00:45:56.448 --> 00:45:57.797
You know.

737
00:45:57.928 --> 00:45:59.712
- All right.
- You know. I'm hanging in there.


738
00:45:59.799 --> 00:46:01.366
- Hello.
- Hey.


739
00:46:01.453 --> 00:46:02.585
Thanks for inviting us.

740
00:46:02.672 --> 00:46:04.282
Of course!
Wait, that ain't me.


741
00:46:04.369 --> 00:46:06.589
Russell invited y'all.

742
00:46:11.594 --> 00:46:12.943
You're not drinking?

743
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:14.902
I had a little bit.

744
00:46:15.032 --> 00:46:16.816
Now, I'm having
a little bit more.


745
00:46:16.904 --> 00:46:18.557
That's a lot more.

746
00:46:25.521 --> 00:46:26.696
Some big news here.

747
00:46:26.783 --> 00:46:28.393
Huge news.
The AP now projecting


748
00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.527
that Donald Trump has won
the state of Pennsylvania.


749
00:46:31.614 --> 00:46:33.833
This is a breaking announcement

750
00:46:33.921 --> 00:46:36.749
- from the Associated Press that cannot be underestimated.
- It's over!


751
00:46:36.836 --> 00:46:40.710
This is 20 more electoral votes
for Donald Trump.


752
00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:42.364
All the pundits--

753
00:46:42.451 --> 00:46:44.453
This is breaking
everyone's expectation--


754
00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:47.412
Honestly, I never thought that
that would happen...


755
00:46:56.682 --> 00:47:00.164
Hey. How've you been?
Good to see you.


756
00:47:00.295 --> 00:47:02.210
I can't believe what's
going on right now.


757
00:47:02.297 --> 00:47:03.733
Crazy, right?

758
00:47:59.919 --> 00:48:02.661
I'm gonna start throwing
parties out here and be done.


759
00:48:02.748 --> 00:48:04.011
This is crazy!

760
00:48:04.098 --> 00:48:06.100
It's fucking crazy!

761
00:48:12.584 --> 00:48:15.761
What is happening
is so crazy!


762
00:48:39.002 --> 00:48:40.525
We need to see this,
though.


763
00:48:40.612 --> 00:48:42.571
Cass, what the fuck
is your girl doing?


764
00:48:42.658 --> 00:48:44.790
- Wait, what's
- Turn it back on!


765
00:48:44.877 --> 00:48:47.097
Wait, wait, wait.

766
00:48:47.184 --> 00:48:50.405
- Can you turn back on the TV?
- Listen, listen, listen, like,


767
00:48:50.492 --> 00:48:51.971
I know we're all
watching this right now,


768
00:48:52.059 --> 00:48:53.886
I know we're all caught up
in this right now,


769
00:48:53.973 --> 00:48:56.498
but I think like, we just
need to take a moment.


770
00:48:56.585 --> 00:48:58.021
We just need to feel good,
like--


771
00:48:58.108 --> 00:48:59.370
It's the election
though!


772
00:48:59.457 --> 00:49:01.111
This is fucking crazy.
I know! I know!


773
00:49:01.198 --> 00:49:02.634
But we need a minute, y'all!

774
00:49:02.721 --> 00:49:04.462
We need a minute to feel good.

775
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:05.942
We want to watch history...

776
00:49:06.029 --> 00:49:07.509
But we don't need
to watch this history.


777
00:49:07.596 --> 00:49:09.076
We need to think
about our history.


778
00:49:09.163 --> 00:49:11.339
We need to think about life,
we need to just...


779
00:49:11.426 --> 00:49:13.210
- feel good, y'all.
- But I am thinking about--


780
00:49:13.297 --> 00:49:14.864
Hey, yo! Hold on.

781
00:49:14.994 --> 00:49:17.562
- Give her a second.
- This is consuming us.


782
00:49:17.649 --> 00:49:20.174
Ma, go do your thing. Do your
thing. Play your-- Play your...


783
00:49:20.261 --> 00:49:21.871
Thank you.

784
00:49:27.703 --> 00:49:30.271
Yeah, I hate it. Hey Cass!
Come get her, man!


785
00:49:30.358 --> 00:49:32.055
Hey, come on, man.

786
00:49:36.059 --> 00:49:37.539
Get out of here!

787
00:49:44.589 --> 00:49:46.330
Turn the TV back on.

788
00:49:49.116 --> 00:49:52.597
Grab her. Grab her.
Dance with her.


789
00:49:54.904 --> 00:49:56.514
Just dance. Just da-
- Hey!

790
00:49:56.601 --> 00:49:59.213
Hey! Just dance. Grab her.

791
00:49:59.343 --> 00:50:00.779
Whatever, I mean...

792
00:50:00.866 --> 00:50:04.131
The world is not
dancing, man.


793
00:50:07.569 --> 00:50:10.485
- Might as well, you know?
- I know. Hell. Yeah.


794
00:50:10.572 --> 00:50:12.226
Watch your drink.

795
00:50:14.271 --> 00:50:15.620
It is, but I mean, you know,

796
00:50:15.707 --> 00:50:17.231
it's not the end
of the world, y'all.


797
00:50:17.318 --> 00:50:19.624
It is
the end of the world!


798
00:50:25.413 --> 00:50:26.892
Cass!

799
00:50:33.247 --> 00:50:34.335
It's good.

800
00:50:34.639 --> 00:50:37.207
It's good what you did.
Hey, hey, hey.


801
00:50:37.294 --> 00:50:39.035
Really! Don't worry about it.

802
00:50:39.122 --> 00:50:40.384
You did good.

803
00:50:40.732 --> 00:50:42.865
You see,
they're hugging each other.


804
00:50:42.952 --> 00:50:43.518
Yeah.

805
00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:48.479
They're dancing. Look.

806
00:50:51.003 --> 00:50:52.309
He's dancing.

807
00:50:59.403 --> 00:51:00.274
You good?

808
00:51:02.406 --> 00:51:03.364
All right.

809
00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:11.763
Sorry!

810
00:51:16.551 --> 00:51:18.117
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey, hey, hey.


811
00:51:18.205 --> 00:51:20.424
Don't worry about it.
Come on. Let's go outside.


812
00:51:20.511 --> 00:51:22.165
Come on, let's go.

813
00:51:23.558 --> 00:51:25.473
Wait! Wait!

814
00:51:26.691 --> 00:51:28.606
You turn the thing off and now
you're leaving with the music?


815
00:51:28.693 --> 00:51:32.262
We're going
upstairs for a bit.


816
00:51:32.697 --> 00:51:35.134
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Love y'all.


817
00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:38.660
Turn the election back on!

818
00:51:38.747 --> 00:51:40.879
Hey, I'm sorry Cass!

819
00:51:40.966 --> 00:51:43.795
...those 20
electoral votes


820
00:51:43.882 --> 00:51:46.537
get Trump to 264, six away--

821
00:51:46.668 --> 00:51:48.583
I like her haircut!

822
00:51:53.762 --> 00:51:55.067
Man...

823
00:51:58.462 --> 00:51:59.768
That was crazy.

824
00:51:59.855 --> 00:52:03.467
Yeah, it was crazy.
Watch your step.


825
00:52:06.078 --> 00:52:07.428
We need that, man.

826
00:52:07.515 --> 00:52:10.039
- Yeah.
- We need that.


827
00:52:10.126 --> 00:52:12.084
Hey.

828
00:52:12.171 --> 00:52:15.827
- I want to show you something.
- Wait. Huh?


829
00:52:15.958 --> 00:52:18.177
Ugh!

830
00:52:18.308 --> 00:52:21.006
- Let me show you something.
- Sorry, what were you saying?


831
00:52:21.093 --> 00:52:23.618
No, take that. Just take it.

832
00:52:23.705 --> 00:52:25.881
- No, take it, take it. It's OK.
- I'm sorry.


833
00:52:25.968 --> 00:52:28.275
It's all right.

834
00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:30.233
Hello?

835
00:52:32.322 --> 00:52:32.888
What?

836
00:52:36.283 --> 00:52:38.807
Yo, yo, yo, yo.
Look, it's--


837
00:52:41.244 --> 00:52:43.855
What are you talking about?

838
00:52:44.769 --> 00:52:46.771
Yeah, well, that was like...
That was your whole thing.


839
00:52:46.858 --> 00:52:49.644
Like, that's your own problem,
like...


840
00:52:49.731 --> 00:52:51.863
Yeah, but why are you
stressing me out like this?


841
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:54.170
It's so annoying, like...

842
00:52:56.303 --> 00:52:59.218
Seriously? Seriously? Now? Now?

843
00:52:59.349 --> 00:53:02.309
Now you're feeling bad? Like...

844
00:53:03.048 --> 00:53:05.616
Dude, what are you
talking about? Like...


845
00:53:05.703 --> 00:53:09.403
Why are you stressing me out
for nothing?


846
00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:19.151
Ugh! Are you serious?
Like, really? Really?


847
00:53:24.679 --> 00:53:26.420
All right, well, I gotta go.

848
00:53:26.507 --> 00:53:27.464
I gotta go!

849
00:54:02.673 --> 00:54:05.241
Hey.

850
00:54:06.285 --> 00:54:06.590
So?

851
00:54:09.811 --> 00:54:10.551
Uh, man.

852
00:54:11.769 --> 00:54:13.249
I had a great time.

853
00:54:13.336 --> 00:54:15.643
I had a lot of fun tonight.

854
00:54:16.339 --> 00:54:17.688
Probably about that time, right?

855
00:54:17.775 --> 00:54:19.342
You gotta get going?

856
00:54:19.429 --> 00:54:21.344
- What?
- You gotta--


857
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:24.216
Wait, wait, what were you
about to show me?


858
00:54:24.303 --> 00:54:26.610
- Nah, it's nothing.
- No, tell me.


859
00:54:26.697 --> 00:54:28.830
You got a flight
to catch, right?


860
00:54:28.917 --> 00:54:31.441
Come on, man.
What were you about to show me?


861
00:54:31.528 --> 00:54:32.921
It's nothing.

862
00:54:33.704 --> 00:54:34.792
Seriously?

863
00:54:36.098 --> 00:54:39.971
- Just show me, like...
- No, it's nothing.


864
00:54:45.673 --> 00:54:46.238
What?

865
00:54:47.457 --> 00:54:47.762
Yo!

866
00:54:50.155 --> 00:54:56.727
All right, then we'll just give up
'cause I can see that you already have.


867
00:54:58.599 --> 00:55:00.470
What'd you say to me?

868
00:55:02.037 --> 00:55:04.822
What about that script
that actress asked about?


869
00:55:04.909 --> 00:55:06.476
Your film that
everybody's waiting to see?


870
00:55:06.563 --> 00:55:08.826
It's all over you, like...

871
00:55:08.957 --> 00:55:11.829
You came out here
to do something.


872
00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:13.788
Are you just giving up?

873
00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:22.405
Says the lady who...

874
00:55:26.931 --> 00:55:30.021
You're not even trying to
follow your dream.


875
00:55:30.108 --> 00:55:31.545
Give me a break.

876
00:55:33.329 --> 00:55:35.636
What do you mean?

877
00:55:36.114 --> 00:55:38.029
What do I mean? You're not
trying to follow your dream.


878
00:55:38.116 --> 00:55:39.509
You're living all safe,

879
00:55:39.596 --> 00:55:41.772
you go back to your little
comfy, boredom,


880
00:55:41.859 --> 00:55:44.688
basic... what,
nine to five?


881
00:55:44.819 --> 00:55:47.909
You kidding me?
Telling me I'm giving up?


882
00:55:47.996 --> 00:55:49.563
Fuck outta here.

883
00:55:49.911 --> 00:55:51.129
- Come on.
- Oh. OK.


884
00:55:51.216 --> 00:55:52.914
So, now you know my life.

885
00:55:53.001 --> 00:55:54.785
- Yeah, I do.
- You do? You know my life?


886
00:55:54.872 --> 00:55:56.613
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, 'cause I live here.


887
00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.137
The city of dreams, right?

888
00:56:00.574 --> 00:56:03.533
People be like,
"Girl, let's go to LA!


889
00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:06.884
Let's go to New York!
Let's go to Miami, but, whoa,


890
00:56:06.971 --> 00:56:11.454
let's not go too crazy, like,
let's not get free."


891
00:56:11.585 --> 00:56:14.152
What you're trying to say?
You're free?


892
00:56:14.239 --> 00:56:15.240
- Yeah.
- Are you free?


893
00:56:15.327 --> 00:56:16.546
- Really?
- Yeah.


894
00:56:16.633 --> 00:56:18.940
- Really?
- Yeah, really.


895
00:56:20.289 --> 00:56:22.509
I'm getting mine, yeah.

896
00:56:24.162 --> 00:56:25.424
You think so?

897
00:56:32.606 --> 00:56:36.871
Mm-hmm, yeah,
I see you getting yours.


898
00:56:36.958 --> 00:56:40.483
You know what's crazy to me?
I think, um...


899
00:56:40.614 --> 00:56:43.181
I think you're safer than I am.

900
00:56:43.268 --> 00:56:45.053
I think the closest that
you've come to feeling alive


901
00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:47.490
is trying to fuck a girl named
Free in the club bathroom.


902
00:56:47.577 --> 00:56:51.538
So, yeah, I see you.
I see you getting yours.


903
00:57:01.112 --> 00:57:02.113
I'm sorry.

904
00:57:06.204 --> 00:57:08.685
I saw that kid, earlier.

905
00:57:08.816 --> 00:57:11.383
I saw how he looked at you.

906
00:57:12.559 --> 00:57:14.082
He admired you.

907
00:57:15.823 --> 00:57:16.258
Hey.

908
00:57:21.002 --> 00:57:23.221
What do you really want?

909
00:57:25.789 --> 00:57:29.184
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.


910
00:57:30.533 --> 00:57:32.056
Nothing happened, all right?

911
00:57:32.143 --> 00:57:33.449
Nothing. Nothing happened.

912
00:57:33.536 --> 00:57:37.279
Everything's always
fucking happening.


913
00:57:38.149 --> 00:57:41.239
I get tired of
fighting every day.


914
00:57:43.415 --> 00:57:45.243
I fight every day.
That's my occupation.


915
00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:47.071
I fight every day.

916
00:57:48.159 --> 00:57:50.118
That's what happened.

917
00:58:14.403 --> 00:58:17.493
He really did a number
on you, huh?


918
00:58:38.253 --> 00:58:38.688
Hey.

919
00:59:19.555 --> 00:59:22.993
Oh, my God!
He did not just win!


920
00:59:23.124 --> 00:59:24.865
He did not just win!

921
00:59:27.041 --> 00:59:30.261
Trump is fucking
president.


922
00:59:32.307 --> 00:59:33.569
Oh...

923
00:59:41.969 --> 00:59:42.404
Wow.

924
01:00:17.004 --> 01:00:17.569
Oh...

925
01:00:28.232 --> 01:00:29.668
Geez...

926
01:00:41.942 --> 01:00:43.508
I'll follow you.

927
01:00:45.162 --> 01:00:46.468
Shit.

928
01:01:34.646 --> 01:01:36.126
Hey, hey, y'all!
Hey, hey, hey.


929
01:01:36.213 --> 01:01:37.824
Everybody knows what
it's like to fight.


930
01:01:37.911 --> 01:01:40.652
We've all fuckin'
have fought before.


931
01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:43.655
Everybody knows what
it feels like to struggle.


932
01:01:43.742 --> 01:01:45.744
Uh, struggle to be loved,

933
01:01:45.832 --> 01:01:48.356
to love, to work,
to be free.


934
01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:53.013
So, uh...

935
01:01:55.798 --> 01:01:57.060
we're still fighting, right?

936
01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:59.236
Tonight proves
that it's not different.


937
01:01:59.323 --> 01:02:01.717
So now we know we just got
more work to do.


938
01:02:01.804 --> 01:02:04.633
That means you too, huh?

939
01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:05.329
What?

940
01:02:06.243 --> 01:02:07.984
That means you too.

941
01:02:08.071 --> 01:02:12.075
What you're saying is you got
more work to do, too, right?


942
01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:13.468
Yeah, Ray.

943
01:02:13.555 --> 01:02:16.471
Real work that we all know
you can do.


944
01:02:18.168 --> 01:02:19.996
- I said, "Yeah."
- Yeah.


945
01:02:20.083 --> 01:02:23.043
- All right.
- That means me, too.


946
01:02:24.087 --> 01:02:26.698
Handle your business, Cass.

947
01:02:36.926 --> 01:02:37.840
Let's go.

948
01:03:00.428 --> 01:03:02.038
Oh, man...

949
01:03:40.337 --> 01:03:41.643
Ohh...

950
01:03:45.125 --> 01:03:48.737
Doesn't look as bright
as it was before.


951
01:03:49.564 --> 01:03:50.826
Yeah.

952
01:03:53.176 --> 01:03:54.264
Oh, well...

953
01:04:02.794 --> 01:04:06.450
Naqeeb...
you're still here.


954
01:04:07.669 --> 01:04:09.323
Yeah, I got, uh...

955
01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:11.542
stuck listening to all of this.

956
01:04:11.629 --> 01:04:14.328
I would've been
a danger on the road, so...


957
01:04:14.415 --> 01:04:16.025
I didn't drive.

958
01:04:16.156 --> 01:04:17.940
Understood.

959
01:04:18.071 --> 01:04:19.811
What is it, man?

960
01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:22.858
How could you not be,
man?


961
01:04:24.816 --> 01:04:27.123
You guys leaving?

962
01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:28.603
You want some company?

963
01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:31.214
Yeah.
Could use some of that.


964
01:04:31.301 --> 01:04:33.042
So how about I order it
and then you--


965
01:04:33.129 --> 01:04:35.697
No, man. I got you.

966
01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:37.612
Nah, it's cool. I can--

967
01:04:37.699 --> 01:04:40.006
Nah.
Where you all goin'?


968
01:04:40.093 --> 01:04:40.745
Hop in.

969
01:04:41.485 --> 01:04:42.834
Goin' to Mel's.

970
01:04:42.921 --> 01:04:46.534
- I got you.
- All right.


971
01:05:10.906 --> 01:05:11.863
Thank you.

972
01:05:12.473 --> 01:05:14.344
Of course.

973
01:05:14.475 --> 01:05:17.347
- You said "Mel's", right?
- Yeah.


974
01:05:17.434 --> 01:05:18.957
Donald Trump,
after the election's,


975
01:05:19.045 --> 01:05:21.047
president-elect
of the United States.


976
01:05:21.134 --> 01:05:24.920
And then Clinton headquarters
in New York City


977
01:05:25.007 --> 01:05:28.271
stand on baited breath
waiting for the final word,


978
01:05:28.358 --> 01:05:30.839
that there may
still be a chance,


979
01:05:30.926 --> 01:05:33.668
but all they get instead
is a simple statement


980
01:05:33.755 --> 01:05:35.974
from Chairman John Podesta,

981
01:05:36.062 --> 01:05:38.934
saying, "We're not going to have
anything to say tonight.


982
01:05:39.021 --> 01:05:41.589
Get some sleep.
We're so proud of you--"


983
01:05:41.676 --> 01:05:43.417
Naqeeb, you can turn the heat
down a little bit.


984
01:05:43.504 --> 01:05:44.983
Of course.

985
01:05:45.071 --> 01:05:47.377
"She's not done yet."

986
01:05:47.464 --> 01:05:49.597
I'm at a loss for words.

987
01:05:50.032 --> 01:05:52.600
I digress,
I go to my listeners.


988
01:05:52.687 --> 01:05:53.905
Caller one?

989
01:05:57.474 --> 01:06:00.303
It's kinda funny saying "Turn
the heat down in Los Angeles."


990
01:06:02.305 --> 01:06:04.742
He's waving
to the public.


991
01:06:04.829 --> 01:06:06.657
There's no question--

992
01:06:06.744 --> 01:06:08.659
It's kind of a cold night,
though.


993
01:06:08.746 --> 01:06:10.835
Understand.

994
01:06:12.837 --> 01:06:15.057
...misogyny, homophobia,
the bigotry...


995
01:06:15.144 --> 01:06:18.234
This is what we've seen
in real time


996
01:06:18.365 --> 01:06:21.411
and through history
with this guy,


997
01:06:21.542 --> 01:06:25.328
when he was kicking black people
out of their homes in New York,


998
01:06:25.415 --> 01:06:27.417
when he was piling up

999
01:06:27.548 --> 01:06:30.464
the sexual assault cases
from these young women,


1000
01:06:30.551 --> 01:06:33.684
a lot of them are probably still
scared to say anything.


1001
01:06:33.771 --> 01:06:36.513
But what's deeper than that,
Tim, what's deeper than that,


1002
01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:39.342
what I'm worried about is what's
happening to our country.


1003
01:06:39.429 --> 01:06:41.692
What's happening to the people,

1004
01:06:41.779 --> 01:06:43.259
to the children,

1005
01:06:43.346 --> 01:06:45.131
because of a guy like that...

1006
01:06:45.218 --> 01:06:48.177
Say what you will
about Obama,


1007
01:06:48.308 --> 01:06:51.224
but he won by people
coming together


1008
01:06:51.311 --> 01:06:53.922
and believing
in something bigger.


1009
01:06:54.009 --> 01:06:57.752
I remember that day
and I know you do, too.


1010
01:06:57.839 --> 01:07:00.537
Trump? Trump will not heal.

1011
01:07:00.668 --> 01:07:03.279
It was his appeal.

1012
01:07:03.366 --> 01:07:06.064
And now,
this country's more divided


1013
01:07:06.152 --> 01:07:08.154
than I've ever seen in my life.

1014
01:07:08.241 --> 01:07:09.155
My job...

1015
01:07:14.638 --> 01:07:16.858
we represent bad people.

1016
01:07:19.556 --> 01:07:22.603
There's too many
bad people winning.


1017
01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:27.564
...just lying
and hateful and violent--


1018
01:07:27.695 --> 01:07:29.740
Too many bad people winning.

1019
01:07:29.827 --> 01:07:32.569
And I'm afraid.

1020
01:07:33.657 --> 01:07:35.529
Can't say it better.

1021
01:07:37.487 --> 01:07:38.488
Sums it up.

1022
01:07:50.283 --> 01:07:51.632
God.

1023
01:07:52.459 --> 01:07:54.852
Dig even deeper
than that and what do we have?


1024
01:07:54.939 --> 01:07:57.942
We have, what, the-the massacre

1025
01:07:58.073 --> 01:08:01.163
of our-our Native...
Native American Indians?


1026
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:03.861
Dig deeper.
What about slavery?


1027
01:08:03.948 --> 01:08:08.518
And the confiscation
of our native peoples' land?


1028
01:08:08.649 --> 01:08:12.522
He made
America hate again.


1029
01:08:14.176 --> 01:08:18.224
This country is called "the
United States," for a reason.


1030
01:08:18.311 --> 01:08:20.008
Think about that.

1031
01:08:20.443 --> 01:08:24.273
The first name in our country
is "United".


1032
01:08:25.883 --> 01:08:27.276
And, I'm sorry,

1033
01:08:28.799 --> 01:08:30.584
we're more divided than ever.

1034
01:08:30.671 --> 01:08:34.283
And I don't know
what's gonna change it.


1035
01:08:35.676 --> 01:08:37.895
That's all I gotta say.
Thank you.


1036
01:08:37.982 --> 01:08:39.375
Oh, my goodness.

1037
01:08:39.462 --> 01:08:41.290
Rob, I'm happy to know

1038
01:08:41.377 --> 01:08:43.379
there are people like you
out there in the world.


1039
01:08:43.466 --> 01:08:47.296
That this is what makes
America great.


1040
01:08:48.515 --> 01:08:49.167
You OK?

1041
01:08:56.174 --> 01:08:57.088
I will be.

1042
01:09:22.766 --> 01:09:24.551
Trump promised
to build a separate wall


1043
01:09:24.638 --> 01:09:26.553
between the southern border
and Mexico.


1044
01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.859
Bringing back
manufacturing jobs--


1045
01:09:33.211 --> 01:09:37.085
Feel bad for the children
that have to...


1046
01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:40.610
Say the first president
was this guy.


1047
01:10:06.157 --> 01:10:08.421
What are you thinking?

1048
01:10:10.336 --> 01:10:13.948
Was thinking how
I named my son after...


1049
01:10:14.818 --> 01:10:16.429
my favorite poet.

1050
01:10:20.258 --> 01:10:22.826
Or how excited I was to, um--

1051
01:10:24.393 --> 01:10:28.049
when he was old enough
to understand it.


1052
01:10:28.223 --> 01:10:31.661
Yeah, Rumi was one of our
great writers.


1053
01:10:32.836 --> 01:10:34.447
I was thinking how

1054
01:10:39.626 --> 01:10:42.106
there would be nothing better
right now than for my kid


1055
01:10:42.193 --> 01:10:44.195
to write a poem, so...

1056
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:58.427
Oh, man...

1057
01:11:07.393 --> 01:11:10.396
I always tell him
that he's smart,


1058
01:11:10.526 --> 01:11:13.181
he's strong and he's loving.

1059
01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:22.408
If he's anything like,
you, then he is.


1060
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:29.589
It's nice to meet you.

1061
01:11:31.242 --> 01:11:33.636
It's nice to meet you, too.

1062
01:12:17.593 --> 01:12:19.465
You know what, Free?

1063
01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:24.121
It's safe to say
I'm starting to remember


1064
01:12:24.208 --> 01:12:25.993
why I moved out here.

1065
01:12:29.126 --> 01:12:29.562
Why?

1066
01:12:55.022 --> 01:12:58.112
So the good people
can win for once.


1067
01:12:58.242 --> 01:13:01.115
The good people
can win for one.


1068
01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:04.335
Amen.

1069
01:13:07.034 --> 01:13:08.992
Naqeeb, you want anything?

1070
01:13:09.079 --> 01:13:12.605
Nah, I'm good, man.
Thank you.


1071
01:13:12.692 --> 01:13:14.084
God bless you.

1072
01:13:14.215 --> 01:13:16.434
As
-Salaam
-Alaikum.

1073
01:13:16.522 --> 01:13:19.916
Wa
-Alaikum
-Salaam.

1074
01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:21.298
Is this...?

1075
01:15:22.386 --> 01:15:24.606
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1076
01:18:12.469 --> 01:18:13.122
Wow...

1077
01:18:16.256 --> 01:18:16.691
Wow.

1078
01:18:19.476 --> 01:18:22.610
- What are you thinking?
- I mean...


1079
01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:28.224
I need to see this.

1080
01:18:28.616 --> 01:18:31.575
- Like, I need to see that.
- But it's not--


1081
01:18:31.662 --> 01:18:33.490
The full-length version
of that!


1082
01:18:33.577 --> 01:18:36.363
- It's a rough-- Gotta edit it--
- No. No! No, seriously.


1083
01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:38.234
Like, you need to send that.

1084
01:18:38.321 --> 01:18:39.757
Send the script.

1085
01:18:39.845 --> 01:18:41.498
It's just--
It's not finished--


1086
01:18:41.585 --> 01:18:44.545
Send the script to the actress
from the club.


1087
01:18:44.632 --> 01:18:46.939
Just send it to her.
Send it as is.


1088
01:18:47.026 --> 01:18:48.679
Go for it. Like...

1089
01:18:52.727 --> 01:18:54.990
Like... do you understand

1090
01:18:55.121 --> 01:18:57.036
how important this is now?

1091
01:18:57.123 --> 01:18:59.473
And how important art is?

1092
01:19:00.213 --> 01:19:02.041
This is everything,
this is our voice,


1093
01:19:02.128 --> 01:19:03.651
this is who we are.

1094
01:19:03.738 --> 01:19:06.001
This is all we have left.

1095
01:19:06.132 --> 01:19:09.309
This is important, man, like...

1096
01:19:10.397 --> 01:19:12.094
Just let me clean it up first.

1097
01:19:12.181 --> 01:19:12.921
No, man.

1098
01:19:15.706 --> 01:19:17.926
You need to send that.

1099
01:19:18.057 --> 01:19:22.583
You need to send that.
Like, you need to send that!


1100
01:19:22.713 --> 01:19:23.845
Seriously.

1101
01:19:26.065 --> 01:19:27.283
This is everything.

1102
01:19:27.370 --> 01:19:28.676
- Yeah?
- Whoa.


1103
01:19:29.807 --> 01:19:32.506
Oh, with everything
that's going on,


1104
01:19:32.593 --> 01:19:36.249
the fucking shit
we're dealing with, like...


1105
01:19:36.336 --> 01:19:37.903
we got nothing else.

1106
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:39.556
We got our voice.

1107
01:19:40.644 --> 01:19:42.646
We got what we put
into the world.


1108
01:19:42.733 --> 01:19:45.040
We got purpose, we got...

1109
01:19:46.563 --> 01:19:48.130
We can inspire.

1110
01:19:51.481 --> 01:19:53.570
It can really change things.

1111
01:19:53.657 --> 01:19:55.572
- You really think so?
- I really do.


1112
01:19:55.659 --> 01:19:57.270
I really, really--

1113
01:19:57.357 --> 01:19:58.445
I really do.

1114
01:20:03.145 --> 01:20:06.366
- You're not bullshitting me?
- No.


1115
01:20:08.672 --> 01:20:09.673
All right.

1116
01:20:10.457 --> 01:20:11.762
You send that,

1117
01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.635
get this thing going,

1118
01:20:15.244 --> 01:20:16.680
and I'll, um...

1119
01:20:17.594 --> 01:20:19.683
I'll cancel my flight.

1120
01:20:23.339 --> 01:20:24.297
I'll stay.

1121
01:20:26.647 --> 01:20:28.562
- No, for real, like, I'll--
- You wouldn't do that.


1122
01:20:28.649 --> 01:20:33.610
--cancel my flight. I'll quit
my fucking job and stay.


1123
01:20:34.698 --> 01:20:36.570
You crazy.

1124
01:20:42.968 --> 01:20:44.534
You're for real.

1125
01:20:46.362 --> 01:20:47.102
Send it.

1126
01:20:50.932 --> 01:20:53.413
My flight is right here.

1127
01:20:56.546 --> 01:20:57.330
Send it.

1128
01:21:01.029 --> 01:21:01.812
Send it.

1129
01:21:40.373 --> 01:21:41.765
One...

1130
01:21:41.896 --> 01:21:42.549
two...

1131
01:21:43.724 --> 01:21:44.377
three.
