00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.393
<i>Testing, one, two, three.</i>

2
00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:23.228
<i>Roy Cohn, September 28.</i>

3
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.651
I was writing a profile of Roy Cohn.

4
00:00:32.653 --> 00:00:34.406
<i>My recorder is going, and...</i>

5
00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.200
I'm taking notes as well, and I said...

6
00:00:37.284 --> 00:00:39.036
<i>What makes Roy Cohn tick?</i>

7
00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:45.834
<i>A love of a good fight.</i>

8
00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:51.715
<i>A certain pleasure I derive
in fighting against power</i>


9
00:00:51.798 --> 00:00:53.884
<i>and the establishment.</i>

10
00:00:56.386 --> 00:01:01.934
<i>I will take on a cause against
practically anybody.</i>


11
00:01:04.685 --> 00:01:06.313
<i>I hate hypocrisy.</i>

12
00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:10.734
<i>Roy Cohn was called
the most brilliant and influential lawyer</i>


13
00:01:10.817 --> 00:01:11.944
<i>in America.</i>

14
00:01:12.027 --> 00:01:14.279
<i>His specialty was power.</i>

15
00:01:14.363 --> 00:01:17.574
<i>And from the very beginning,
he was flamboyant,</i>


16
00:01:17.658 --> 00:01:20.452
<i>he was ruthless and always controversial.</i>

17
00:01:22.913 --> 00:01:25.916
<i>And he was like a caged animal.</i>

18
00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:28.627
<i>If you opened the door to the cage,</i>

19
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.587
<i>he would come out and get you.</i>

20
00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:37.469
<i>Roy Cohn's contempt for people,
his contempt for the law,</i>


21
00:01:38.553 --> 00:01:41.014
<i>was so evident on his face</i>

22
00:01:41.098 --> 00:01:43.850
<i>that if you were in his presence,</i>

23
00:01:43.934 --> 00:01:46.812
<i>you knew you were
in the presence of evil.</i>

24
00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.325
<i>And he saw himself as a political puppeteer.</i>

25
00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.328
<i>He could pull strings and bring people together.</i>

26
00:02:03.412 --> 00:02:06.498
<i>He could pull strings
and make people do things.</i>


27
00:02:10.544 --> 00:02:14.089
<i>Roy Cohn is the common thread
from Senator Joe McCarthy...</i>


28
00:02:15.257 --> 00:02:18.802
<i>all the way to his protégé, 
Donald Trump.</i>

29
00:02:22.306 --> 00:02:26.893
<i>When you look at Cohn's life,
you're shining a light...</i>


30
00:02:26.977 --> 00:02:28.478
<i>on demagoguery...</i>

31
00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:30.981
<i>hypocrisy...</i>

32
00:02:31.064 --> 00:02:34.067
<i>and the darkest parts
of the American psyche.</i>


33
00:02:36.737 --> 00:02:40.866
<i>USA! USA! USA!</i>

34
00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:43.493
The Roy Cohn show, which is unbelievable.

35
00:02:58.383 --> 00:03:01.720
Now here's Roy Cohn, who appeared recently
on the cover of <i>Esquire</i> magazine.


36
00:03:01.803 --> 00:03:05.432
And the title of that article, as I recall, sir,
was "The Legal Executioner."


37
00:03:05.515 --> 00:03:08.101
-Yeah.
-It went on to say that you are really a tough man


38
00:03:08.185 --> 00:03:12.522
-and that at times you can...
-Tough, mean, vicious, so on.


39
00:03:12.606 --> 00:03:16.109
What does that kind of publicity do
for your business in New York?


40
00:03:16.193 --> 00:03:17.194
Oh, it's fantastic.

41
00:03:17.277 --> 00:03:20.322
The worse the adjectives,
the better it is for business.


42
00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:22.699
What are they looking for?
What are they buying?


43
00:03:22.783 --> 00:03:23.825
Scare value.

44
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.246
Going back, over a period of years,
when I call somebody


45
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.123
or write a letter or something like that,

46
00:03:30.207 --> 00:03:32.459
this is supposed to make them
tremble and think,


47
00:03:32.542 --> 00:03:35.671
unless they act promptly and reasonably,

48
00:03:35.754 --> 00:03:39.549
that all sorts of terrible consequences
are gonna flow.


49
00:03:42.511 --> 00:03:47.015
Roy's reputation in the courtroom
was for such viciousness


50
00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.351
that merely retaining him

51
00:03:49.434 --> 00:03:53.772
usually caused the other side in any dispute
to want to settle immediately.


52
00:03:53.855 --> 00:03:58.777
I hired Roy Cohn
because he is a tough son of a bitch.


53
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.906
If I can compare this with a Western,
it's like bringing in a hired gun.


54
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.824
That's right.

55
00:04:03.907 --> 00:04:05.117
My name is Roy Cohn.

56
00:04:08.704 --> 00:04:13.750
The way Roy Cohn practiced
as an attorney was:


57
00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:18.337
"I don't care what the law is.
I wanna know who the judge is."


58
00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:23.635
That's the way he worked,
because that's how he manipulated the system.


59
00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:29.474
I would do anything to get my client to win.
Yes, I would. That's my job.


60
00:04:29.558 --> 00:04:31.727
There isn't anything I would not do,

61
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.398
because I believe there's only one answer
in an adversary profession like law,


62
00:04:36.481 --> 00:04:38.066
and that is winning.

63
00:04:39.067 --> 00:04:44.197
And he did it in ways that were,
you know, beyond Machiavellian.


64
00:04:45.407 --> 00:04:50.829
<i>He was an amazing manipulator,
and often got his way as a result.</i>


65
00:04:50.912 --> 00:04:53.165
What are they confiscating?

66
00:04:53.248 --> 00:04:55.751
-Packets of white powder.
-But what was it?


67
00:04:55.834 --> 00:04:57.294
Was it cocaine?

68
00:04:57.377 --> 00:04:59.671
It was not in his briefcase.

69
00:04:59.755 --> 00:05:02.382
They do not allege
it was in his briefcase.

70
00:05:02.466 --> 00:05:06.136
I've read the complaint, and I was in court,
and you weren't.


71
00:05:10.182 --> 00:05:13.226
<i>Roy was somebody that had no boundaries.</i>

72
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.270
And if you were on
the right side of him,

73
00:05:15.354 --> 00:05:16.188
it was great,

74
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:18.857
and if you were on the wrong side of him,
it was terrible.


75
00:05:20.442 --> 00:05:23.236
<i>He loved power.</i>

76
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.617
He loved pulling the levers of power.
And he got a taste for that very early in his career.


77
00:05:43.924 --> 00:05:46.718
<i>Here's a man that everybody
is going to enjoy meeting.</i>


78
00:05:46.802 --> 00:05:51.139
He's Roy M. Cohn, who is confidential assistant
to the United States Attorney General,


79
00:05:51.223 --> 00:05:52.975
and, of course, they've been very busy

80
00:05:53.058 --> 00:05:56.103
prosecuting the Communists
and Communist Party.


81
00:05:56.186 --> 00:05:57.646
-Hi, Roy.
-How are you, Jack?


82
00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.398
What can you tell us, Roy,

83
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:04.569
that we might not know
from general newspaper coverage


84
00:06:04.653 --> 00:06:07.322
of the workings of
the party in this country?

85
00:06:07.406 --> 00:06:10.075
What can we watch for as individual citizens?

86
00:06:10.158 --> 00:06:13.245
Well, the Communists, the one thing
we have to understand at the outset


87
00:06:13.328 --> 00:06:14.997
is that the Communist Party--

88
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.582
<i>...is not a political party.</i>

89
00:06:16.665 --> 00:06:18.417
<i>It is a way of life.</i>

90
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.836
<i>An evil and malignant way of life.</i>

91
00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:24.172
It reveals a condition akin to disease,

92
00:06:24.256 --> 00:06:26.091
that spreads like an epidemic,

93
00:06:26.174 --> 00:06:32.014
and like an epidemic, a quarantine is necessary
to keep it from infecting this nation.


94
00:06:32.097 --> 00:06:34.266
<i>It's a criminal conspiracy.</i>

95
00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:40.439
<i>Its object is the overthrow of the government
of the United States by force and violence...</i>


96
00:06:40.522 --> 00:06:43.650
and institute the worst type dictatorship
this world has ever known.


97
00:06:46.612 --> 00:06:49.489
<i>This was the height of the Cold War.</i>

98
00:06:49.573 --> 00:06:53.952
People were genuinely terrified
of a nuclear attack


99
00:06:54.036 --> 00:06:57.456
and of the so-called Communist menace.

100
00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:02.461
<i>President Truman's dramatic announcement
that Russia has created an atomic explosion</i>


101
00:07:02.544 --> 00:07:04.838
<i>sends reporters racing for the United Nations.</i>

102
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:10.344
Got any statement about President Truman's
statement on the atomic bomb?


103
00:07:10.427 --> 00:07:13.221
-Please, please, excuse me.
-Does Russia have the atomic bomb, sir?


104
00:07:13.305 --> 00:07:15.140
-Won't you reply to me?
-What can we do?


105
00:07:16.683 --> 00:07:18.727
<i>It was a period of hysteria.</i>

106
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.523
You really start to see the paranoid style
of politics unfold.


107
00:07:23.607 --> 00:07:26.443
<i>And Roy Cohn was right there.</i>

108
00:07:28.278 --> 00:07:33.450
<i>One of the greatest peacetime spy dramas
in the nation's history reaches its climax</i>


109
00:07:33.533 --> 00:07:36.411
<i>as Julius Rosenberg and Mrs. 
Ethel Rosenberg,</i>

110
00:07:36.495 --> 00:07:39.623
<i>convicted of revealing atomic secrets
to the Russians,</i>


111
00:07:39.706 --> 00:07:43.043
<i>enter the federal building in New York
to hear their doom.</i>


112
00:07:43.126 --> 00:07:47.965
He became one of the prosecutors
in the trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.


113
00:07:51.134 --> 00:07:55.806
<i>The appointment of Jewish prosecutors
and a Jewish judge</i>


114
00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:57.557
<i>was to create the impression</i>

115
00:07:57.641 --> 00:08:00.394
<i>that it was not an anti
-Semitic prosecution.</i>

116
00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:06.900
He was only 23 years old,
but Roy Cohn was ruthless.


117
00:08:06.984 --> 00:08:09.319
Roy Cohn knew how to bully,

118
00:08:09.403 --> 00:08:14.408
and he was willing to do whatever he could
to manipulate the result.


119
00:08:16.535 --> 00:08:20.581
Cohn felt he could ride the wave
of anti-Communism


120
00:08:20.664 --> 00:08:22.666
to further his own career.

121
00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:27.754
<i>And, in fact, his role in that case
is subject to very serious ethical questions.</i>


122
00:08:29.923 --> 00:08:32.676
According to Cohn,
Judge Kaufman would call him


123
00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:36.555
from a phone booth
outside Park Avenue Synagogue,


124
00:08:36.638 --> 00:08:40.892
<i>where he urged Kaufman
to impose the death penalty.</i>


125
00:08:42.352 --> 00:08:45.772
It was a pathway to power
for Kaufman, the judge,


126
00:08:45.856 --> 00:08:48.233
<i>and for Roy Cohn.</i>

127
00:08:48.317 --> 00:08:53.071
They seized the moment. They pushed it
as far as they could, and it went there.


128
00:08:53.155 --> 00:08:57.618
<i>Judge Irving Kaufman sentenced both Rosenbergs
to death in the electric chair.</i>


129
00:08:57.701 --> 00:09:02.414
<i>It is the first time in peacetime
that such a death penalty has been handed down.</i>


130
00:09:07.502 --> 00:09:10.172
<i>The country was polarized over the verdict.</i>

131
00:09:11.632 --> 00:09:14.718
<i>People took to the streets to protest,</i>

132
00:09:14.801 --> 00:09:18.013
<i>seeking clemency, which was not granted.</i>

133
00:09:44.915 --> 00:09:47.584
<i>The government never had enough evidence</i>

134
00:09:47.668 --> 00:09:52.965
<i>to convict Ethel, and yet they convicted her,
sentenced her to death</i>


135
00:09:53.048 --> 00:09:55.759
<i>and killed her in the electric chair.</i>

136
00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.306
And it was a deal
that Roy Cohn helped engineer.


137
00:10:09.064 --> 00:10:11.900
-She just kept her hands open like this.
-Right.


138
00:10:22.786 --> 00:10:26.081
I think, if these people are made to understand
that like any other criminals,


139
00:10:26.164 --> 00:10:30.711
when they violate our laws, they will be punished,
that that will have a strong deterrent effect.


140
00:10:30.794 --> 00:10:35.632
And I think that the death sentence imposed
by Judge Irving R. Kaufman in the atom spy trial


141
00:10:35.716 --> 00:10:37.467
had a very strong deterrent effect.

142
00:10:37.551 --> 00:10:42.180
I think it's been a very good year
on the anti-Communist front in this country.


143
00:10:51.106 --> 00:10:57.404
<i>My father took me to the corner of our block
to see the funeral procession go by.</i>


144
00:11:00.073 --> 00:11:03.744
I'm not sure where he really stood
on the Rosenberg case.


145
00:11:05.162 --> 00:11:07.080
<i>But he wanted me to see this.</i>

146
00:11:08.332 --> 00:11:10.542
<i>This was a part of history.</i>

147
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.090
<i>And it had an indelible effect on me...</i>

148
00:11:18.175 --> 00:11:19.968
<i>and on all of America.</i>

149
00:11:32.481 --> 00:11:34.983
<i>Cohn makes his career
on the backs of the Rosenbergs,</i>


150
00:11:35.067 --> 00:11:37.861
<i>showing that he's not
just a smart, young punk,</i>

151
00:11:37.945 --> 00:11:42.449
but that he's a go-for-the-jugular district attorney
who can quite literally


152
00:11:42.532 --> 00:11:44.826
strap people into the electric chair.

153
00:11:48.497 --> 00:11:53.502
<i>Our guest on</i> Meet the Press,
<i>ladies and gentlemen, is Roy M. Cohn.</i>


154
00:11:53.585 --> 00:11:57.923
I'd like to put you on the receiving end
of some questions you usually ask witnesses.


155
00:11:58.006 --> 00:11:58.924
All right.

156
00:11:59.007 --> 00:12:00.926
When and where were you born?

157
00:12:01.009 --> 00:12:04.930
I was born in
New York City in 1927.

158
00:12:12.229 --> 00:12:15.148
<i>Roy came from an unconventional family.</i>

159
00:12:15.232 --> 00:12:18.944
<i>His mother, Dora, was a privileged member
of Jewish society.</i>


160
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:24.116
When Roy was born, the family consisted of

161
00:12:24.199 --> 00:12:27.202
<i>the Bank of United States,
which was a big name at the time,</i>


162
00:12:27.286 --> 00:12:28.912
<i>Van Heusen Corporation,</i>

163
00:12:28.996 --> 00:12:30.372
<i>Lionel Trains,</i>

164
00:12:30.455 --> 00:12:33.250
<i>and my own grandfather, who had started Q-tips.</i>

165
00:12:35.168 --> 00:12:39.423
<i>The truth is,
Dora was not a very attractive woman.</i>


166
00:12:40.424 --> 00:12:41.800
Dora, according to my mother,

167
00:12:41.883 --> 00:12:44.803
was the ugliest girl in the Bronx.

168
00:12:44.886 --> 00:12:49.725
<i>Not only was she not attractive physically,
but she had a difficult personality.</i>


169
00:12:51.018 --> 00:12:52.394
Nobody would marry Dora.

170
00:12:53.395 --> 00:12:57.899
<i>So they cut a deal with a young lawyer
named Al Cohn.</i>


171
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.529
If he married Dora, they
would make him a judge.

172
00:13:06.241 --> 00:13:09.244
They had one child,
and that child was Roy.

173
00:13:12.205 --> 00:13:15.667
<i>Al and Dora Cohn
had a very frosty relationship.</i>


174
00:13:15.751 --> 00:13:19.713
They both focused on Roy a lot,
Dora even more than Al.


175
00:13:20.714 --> 00:13:23.091
<i>She was the ultimate doting mother.</i>

176
00:13:24.176 --> 00:13:26.803
<i>He was treated like a young prince.</i>

177
00:13:29.806 --> 00:13:32.893
<i>Like any mother, she wanted a son
who was perfect,</i>


178
00:13:32.976 --> 00:13:36.563
and she had a son
that was short and unattractive.


179
00:13:36.647 --> 00:13:38.941
And she tried to correct his nose.

180
00:13:39.024 --> 00:13:43.028
And she wanted a different son
from the son that God gave her.


181
00:13:45.113 --> 00:13:48.408
<i>That imbued him a sense of shame
about who he was,</i>


182
00:13:48.492 --> 00:13:51.036
and his father gave him the language

183
00:13:51.119 --> 00:13:54.998
whereby he would express his shame
in various ways,


184
00:13:55.082 --> 00:13:57.042
through law and politics.

185
00:13:57.125 --> 00:14:00.087
And Dora and Al
together were a perfect storm.

186
00:14:02.631 --> 00:14:06.468
<i>His father was a very active Democrat
in the Bronx</i>


187
00:14:06.551 --> 00:14:10.264
and would have a lot of powerful Democrats
come to dinner.


188
00:14:10.347 --> 00:14:13.016
And when Roy was
9, 10, 11 years old,

189
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.728
his father would insist
that Roy sit at the table with adults.


190
00:14:17.896 --> 00:14:20.148
<i>And Roy would partake in conversation.</i>

191
00:14:21.483 --> 00:14:26.280
<i>When Cohn was 10, his father brought him
to meet President Roosevelt.</i>


192
00:14:30.033 --> 00:14:32.202
Roy dared to opine to the president,

193
00:14:32.286 --> 00:14:34.871
who I'm sure loved hearing it
even from a 10-year-old,


194
00:14:34.955 --> 00:14:38.292
"I support what you're doing,
packing the Supreme Court."


195
00:14:41.878 --> 00:14:46.508
He made his first bribe
when he was about 15 years old.


196
00:14:46.592 --> 00:14:52.139
He got a teacher out of a traffic ticket
when he was in high school.


197
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.726
<i>Roy Cohn knew how the system worked,</i>

198
00:14:55.809 --> 00:14:59.688
<i>and he manipulated that system
for the rest of his life.</i>


199
00:15:03.317 --> 00:15:07.571
<i>You describe yourself, and it rings true,
as a non-conformist.</i>


200
00:15:07.654 --> 00:15:10.991
<i>Right. I am myself, an
oddball in a lot of ways.</i>

201
00:15:12.743 --> 00:15:16.371
<i>I don't like conventional things
or conventional standards</i>


202
00:15:16.455 --> 00:15:19.374
<i>or conventional people
or conventional boredom,</i>


203
00:15:19.458 --> 00:15:21.919
<i>or anything along those lines.</i>

204
00:15:22.002 --> 00:15:26.673
<i>In fact, I, very early
in life, broke with tradition,</i>

205
00:15:26.757 --> 00:15:31.261
<i>and left my Jewish upper-class-oriented life,
in New York,</i>


206
00:15:31.345 --> 00:15:36.642
<i>and became a contradiction of everything
I was supposed to stand for.</i>


207
00:15:38.769 --> 00:15:41.438
<i>Roy was the definition of a self-hating Jew.</i>

208
00:15:42.856 --> 00:15:46.735
<i>He wanted to show to the world
that he wasn't Jewish.</i>


209
00:15:47.736 --> 00:15:52.324
Many things he did over the years
were aimed at proving that to people.


210
00:15:53.867 --> 00:15:57.996
-When were you admitted to the bar?
-I was admitted to the bar in 1948.


211
00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.122
-When...
-Five years ago.


212
00:15:59.206 --> 00:16:01.667
-Five years ago. 21 years old.
-Yes, sir.


213
00:16:02.668 --> 00:16:05.295
<i>He graduated from Columbia Law School at 20.</i>

214
00:16:05.379 --> 00:16:06.463
<i>He was so young</i>

215
00:16:06.546 --> 00:16:10.133
that he wasn't able to be admitted
to the bar for another year, until he was 21.


216
00:16:10.217 --> 00:16:14.930
He was incredibly, incredibly smart,
and he was an expert at taking advantage


217
00:16:15.013 --> 00:16:16.640
<i>of every connection he had.</i>

218
00:16:17.724 --> 00:16:20.435
I was in the Department of Justice
for a period of five years,


219
00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:23.897
and I worked, during that period of time,
very intensively


220
00:16:23.981 --> 00:16:26.108
with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

221
00:16:26.191 --> 00:16:31.655
<i>He attracted great attention
with J. Edgar Hoover at the FBI.</i>


222
00:16:31.738 --> 00:16:37.536
Hoover understood the value
of planting certain information with the press.


223
00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:42.958
<i>Cohn served his master,
passed on the information,</i>


224
00:16:43.041 --> 00:16:48.297
and Hoover returned the compliment
in recommending Cohn as chief counsel


225
00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.300
<i>to Joseph McCarthy's notorious committee.</i>

226
00:17:01.143 --> 00:17:03.937
Even if there were only one Communist
in the State Department,


227
00:17:04.021 --> 00:17:06.732
that would still be one Communist too many.

228
00:17:08.984 --> 00:17:11.736
<i>McCarthy almost single-handedly made the era</i>

229
00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.197
<i>one in which debate became charge
and countercharge.</i>


230
00:17:16.824 --> 00:17:21.621
<i>Cohn soared to national prominence
as McCarthy's handmaiden,</i>


231
00:17:21.705 --> 00:17:25.708
<i>whispering in his ear in a conspiratorial fashion,</i>

232
00:17:25.792 --> 00:17:31.214
advising him how to question witnesses
before the congressional subcommittee.


233
00:17:31.298 --> 00:17:35.093
<i>Roy's tactics and his approach via McCarthy</i>

234
00:17:35.177 --> 00:17:38.597
make him one of the most controversial people
in the country.


235
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.225
I don't think you understood the question.
The question was, "Do you know this man?"


236
00:17:42.309 --> 00:17:45.354
Can you look at the picture and tell us?
I assume the answer's yes or no.


237
00:17:45.437 --> 00:17:48.607
Well, the assumption is a little bit mistaken
in this instance.


238
00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:51.985
Tell us whether you know
the man before you proceed.


239
00:17:52.069 --> 00:17:54.780
-Do you know this man, or don't you?
-Your statements about him


240
00:17:54.863 --> 00:17:58.492
have made it difficult for
me and unsafe for me.

241
00:17:58.575 --> 00:18:03.413
And, of course, McCarthy, we think of him in terms
of investigating Communists.


242
00:18:03.497 --> 00:18:06.792
<i>But he and Cohn also investigated homosexuals.</i>

243
00:18:10.796 --> 00:18:14.424
In the '40s and the '50s,
being gay was such a terrible secret.


244
00:18:15.801 --> 00:18:17.719
<i>And that was true for Roy.</i>

245
00:18:20.055 --> 00:18:25.352
It's just hard for people today to imagine
the damage keeping that secret did


246
00:18:25.435 --> 00:18:27.396
to people and their lives.

247
00:18:28.647 --> 00:18:32.609
<i>And Roy certainly would have done everything
to hide it in any way.</i>


248
00:18:34.069 --> 00:18:37.614
In a kind of "he
doth protest too much" manner,

249
00:18:37.698 --> 00:18:42.703
<i>we have Cohn investigating these homosexuals
very aggressively.</i>


250
00:18:56.216 --> 00:18:59.886
So he's all over the press.
Roy Cohn starts getting


251
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.180
<i>a political and a social profile.</i>

252
00:19:10.355 --> 00:19:15.152
Cohn befriended many
socially connected young men.


253
00:19:15.235 --> 00:19:16.236
<i>Among them...</i>

254
00:19:17.279 --> 00:19:20.282
<i>G. David Schine, a wealthy hotel heir.</i>

255
00:19:21.867 --> 00:19:25.704
<i>Cohn was able to get Schine
on McCarthy's committee.</i>


256
00:19:29.541 --> 00:19:35.339
It's clear to me that Roy had an interest
in this beautiful David Schine


257
00:19:35.422 --> 00:19:37.090
<i>that might have been</i>

258
00:19:37.174 --> 00:19:40.802
not entirely about his mental capacity.

259
00:19:44.097 --> 00:19:49.519
Roy and David Schine
went on a buddy trip together across Europe,


260
00:19:49.603 --> 00:19:53.231
<i>inspecting various facilities, their libraries,</i>

261
00:19:53.315 --> 00:19:57.486
<i>attempting to ferret out any signs
of Communist infiltration.</i>


262
00:20:00.906 --> 00:20:04.826
We are here to gather information,

263
00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:07.663
to double-check leads we have

264
00:20:07.746 --> 00:20:10.791
and to see a vast number of individuals

265
00:20:10.874 --> 00:20:16.630
as long as they can contribute
pertinent information or facts.


266
00:20:16.713 --> 00:20:20.759
I... We believe that the free world
is gonna win the Cold War and win this fight


267
00:20:20.842 --> 00:20:22.469
by one thing: the truth.

268
00:20:22.552 --> 00:20:26.223
Communists are dedicated to the overthrow
of the United States,


269
00:20:26.306 --> 00:20:30.435
who are dedicated to wiping the United States
off the face of the Earth


270
00:20:30.519 --> 00:20:35.649
and substituting the freedom we have in America
for the spiritual and mental enslavement


271
00:20:35.732 --> 00:20:37.234
you have in the Soviet Union.

272
00:20:40.487 --> 00:20:44.408
Roy Cohn has spent most
of his life studying law.


273
00:20:44.491 --> 00:20:46.785
And finally, in his mid-20s,

274
00:20:46.868 --> 00:20:49.663
he has the kind
of romantic crush or compulsion

275
00:20:49.746 --> 00:20:53.292
<i>that most people have for the first time
in high school.</i>


276
00:20:53.375 --> 00:20:58.213
<i>But Roy Cohn happens to have it when he's
chief counsel for the McCarthy committee.</i>


277
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:06.305
Joseph McCarthy himself said that he never saw
Roy Cohn irrational about anything


278
00:21:06.388 --> 00:21:08.890
except G. David Schine.

279
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:14.646
Roy liked to do favors for friends,
even when it was inappropriate.


280
00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:19.109
<i>So when his friend David Schine
was drafted into the Army,</i>


281
00:21:19.192 --> 00:21:21.695
<i>Roy tried to get him special treatment.</i>

282
00:21:21.778 --> 00:21:25.782
And he pulled all the strings he could pull.
He was a string-puller.


283
00:21:25.866 --> 00:21:29.369
This is the way things worked in the Bronx,
in Manhattan politics.


284
00:21:29.453 --> 00:21:34.791
It's not the way things worked in the Army,
and the Army was not gonna have any part of it.


285
00:21:34.875 --> 00:21:38.378
<i>And that prompted the Army
-McCarthy hearings.</i>

286
00:21:42.341 --> 00:21:45.761
<i>Early in 1954, Senator McCarthy said
there were Communists</i>


287
00:21:45.844 --> 00:21:47.346
<i>in the United States Army</i>

288
00:21:47.429 --> 00:21:49.056
<i>and that they were being protected.</i>

289
00:21:49.139 --> 00:21:52.684
<i>The Army replied that his charges were
a form of pressure to get special favors,</i>


290
00:21:52.768 --> 00:21:56.021
<i>including a direct commission
for G. David Schine,</i>


291
00:21:56.104 --> 00:22:00.859
<i>a very special Army private
and former McCarthy assistant.</i>


292
00:22:00.943 --> 00:22:04.237
The Army-McCarthy hearings
pit the United States Army


293
00:22:04.321 --> 00:22:06.365
<i>against Joe McCarthy and Roy Cohn.</i>

294
00:22:07.616 --> 00:22:14.289
Cohn's willing to do anything in order to get
more quality time with G. David Schine.


295
00:22:14.373 --> 00:22:17.334
That's what the Army-McCarthy hearings
were about.


296
00:22:17.417 --> 00:22:21.255
<i>It was televised,
and 20 million stunned Americans</i>


297
00:22:21.338 --> 00:22:26.426
<i>looked on for 36 days
at the greatest political spectacle of our history.</i>


298
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:30.222
<i>A new variable had entered our political life:
television.</i>


299
00:22:36.186 --> 00:22:38.730
Thank you very much, Mr. Welch,
and thank you, Mr. Jenkins.


300
00:22:38.814 --> 00:22:40.649
-You're welcome.
-Mr. Cohn...


301
00:22:42.192 --> 00:22:45.028
I think you are conducting
a little one-sided interview here,


302
00:22:45.112 --> 00:22:49.032
and that's perfectly all right with me, sir.
I'll tell you what I have to say on the...


303
00:22:49.116 --> 00:22:51.076
On the witness stand, under oath.

304
00:22:51.159 --> 00:22:55.914
All right, thank you. That was Roy Cohn
and his opinion of the interview.


305
00:22:55.998 --> 00:23:00.877
You can read the Army-McCarthy hearings
as the original reality TV moment,


306
00:23:00.961 --> 00:23:04.798
because you have what is an open-ended drama

307
00:23:04.881 --> 00:23:07.092
<i>with a cast of repeating characters,</i>

308
00:23:07.175 --> 00:23:09.219
<i>but you really don't know
what's going to happen.</i>


309
00:23:13.515 --> 00:23:16.351
Committee will please come to order.

310
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:21.315
I understand the secretary
of the Army is here

311
00:23:21.398 --> 00:23:23.066
as first witness.

312
00:23:25.152 --> 00:23:30.365
Roy thinks that Dave
ought to be a general

313
00:23:30.449 --> 00:23:34.119
and operate from a penthouse
on the Waldorf Astoria,


314
00:23:34.202 --> 00:23:35.746
or words to that effect.

315
00:23:37.289 --> 00:23:41.293
I asked him what would happen
if Schine got overseas duty.


316
00:23:41.376 --> 00:23:46.423
-You were breaking the news gently, Mr. Adams?
-Yes, sir. That is right.


317
00:23:46.506 --> 00:23:53.513
I think I observe on Colonel Bradley's face
a faint little look of pleasure.


318
00:23:53.597 --> 00:23:56.099
-Do you, sir?
-I would say that Colonel-- I--


319
00:23:59.186 --> 00:24:02.064
You and David Schine

320
00:24:02.147 --> 00:24:06.109
have been what we might call
warm personal friends, have you not?


321
00:24:06.193 --> 00:24:10.697
-He is one of my many good friends, sir, yes.
-One of your many good friends.


322
00:24:10.781 --> 00:24:15.035
And in all fairness, Mr. Cohn, isn't it a fact
that he is one of your best friends?


323
00:24:15.118 --> 00:24:18.705
We all have our best friends.
There's no criticism of you on that account.


324
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:21.833
-No, of course not, sir.
-We have friends whom we love. I do.


325
00:24:27.506 --> 00:24:31.426
There were a lot of snide,
homophobic comments


326
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:35.931
that were leveled at both Cohn and Schine
and at McCarthy.


327
00:24:36.014 --> 00:24:38.475
Did you think this came from a pixie?

328
00:24:40.477 --> 00:24:44.564
Will counsel, for my benefit, define--
I think he might be an expert on that,


329
00:24:44.648 --> 00:24:47.484
-what a pixie is?
-Yeah. Yes. I should say...


330
00:24:47.567 --> 00:24:52.906
I should say, Mr. Senator,
that a pixie is a close relative of a fairy.


331
00:24:57.661 --> 00:25:01.790
With the word "fairy," the subtext
of the Army-McCarthy hearings


332
00:25:01.873 --> 00:25:03.417
is spoken out loud.

333
00:25:08.505 --> 00:25:13.885
But it isn't true that you lose your head now
when Dave Schine's name


334
00:25:13.969 --> 00:25:16.221
-is mentioned and...
-That is...


335
00:25:16.305 --> 00:25:19.182
That is completely untrue, sir.

336
00:25:26.773 --> 00:25:31.945
<i>McCarthy launched a counterattack
by bringing out the fact</i>


337
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:37.743
<i>that one of Welch's associates had been a member
of an alleged Communist organization.</i>


338
00:25:37.826 --> 00:25:40.370
Senator, may we not drop this?

339
00:25:40.454 --> 00:25:43.874
Let us not assassinate this lad further, Senator.

340
00:25:43.957 --> 00:25:46.251
-Let's...
-You've done enough.


341
00:25:46.335 --> 00:25:50.631
<i>Cohn knows that this is the moment
that Joseph Welch is seizing</i>


342
00:25:50.714 --> 00:25:56.428
to finally give the blast at McCarthy
that everybody has been waiting for.


343
00:25:56.511 --> 00:25:58.972
<i>And he starts squirming in his chair.</i>

344
00:25:59.056 --> 00:26:03.060
<i>He sort of tries to gesture
to McCarthy to stop it.</i>


345
00:26:03.143 --> 00:26:05.020
-Let's...
-You've done enough.


346
00:26:05.103 --> 00:26:08.815
Have you no sense of decency, sir?

347
00:26:08.899 --> 00:26:14.404
At long last, have you
left no sense of decency?

348
00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:27.960
That caught the conscience of the country
and ended with McCarthy being discredited.


349
00:26:28.043 --> 00:26:32.673
<i>Indeed, they were both discredited
as a result of Joseph Welch's</i>


350
00:26:32.756 --> 00:26:34.675
<i>"Have you no sense of decency?"</i>

351
00:26:36.969 --> 00:26:40.430
The chair declares these hearings adjourned
sine die.


352
00:26:52.609 --> 00:26:53.819
<i>McCarthyism.</i>

353
00:26:55.237 --> 00:26:58.073
<i>I'm not referring to the senator from Wisconsin.</i>

354
00:26:58.156 --> 00:27:03.745
<i>He's only important in that his name has taken on
a dictionary meaning in the world.</i>


355
00:27:03.829 --> 00:27:07.666
<i>That meaning is the corruption of truth,</i>

356
00:27:07.749 --> 00:27:11.920
<i>the abandonment of our historical devotion
to fair play.</i>


357
00:27:12.004 --> 00:27:15.924
<i>It is the abandonment
of due process of law.</i>

358
00:27:16.008 --> 00:27:17.676
<i>It is the use of a big lie</i>

359
00:27:17.759 --> 00:27:20.679
<i>and the unfounded accusation
against any citizen</i>


360
00:27:20.762 --> 00:27:23.724
<i>in the name of Americanism and security.</i>

361
00:27:23.807 --> 00:27:27.811
<i>It is the rise to power of the demagogue
who lives on untruth.</i>


362
00:27:27.894 --> 00:27:33.609
<i>It is the spread of fear and the destruction of faith
in every level of our society.</i>


363
00:27:38.947 --> 00:27:43.869
<i>What a demagogue does is throw out information
that they know is salacious,</i>


364
00:27:43.952 --> 00:27:47.164
<i>attention-grabbing and headline-grabbing.</i>

365
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.835
And Roy proved that in the McCarthy period.

366
00:27:58.133 --> 00:28:03.972
<i>Roy Cohn knew how to take a bad situation
and absolutely make the most of it.</i>


367
00:28:04.056 --> 00:28:07.309
No matter what happens,
no matter how defeated you are,


368
00:28:07.392 --> 00:28:11.605
no matter how deeply you wind up in the muck,
claim victory.


369
00:28:11.688 --> 00:28:16.109
I can't help but feel that Roy Cohn
has won a really great victory.


370
00:28:29.373 --> 00:28:32.584
<i>His persona as this
slick, maybe a little oily,</i>

371
00:28:32.668 --> 00:28:36.838
but really razor-sharp lawyer
has been carved in stone.


372
00:28:38.507 --> 00:28:41.134
And that's what he's going to be
for the rest of his career.


373
00:28:42.135 --> 00:28:45.889
<i>No more shuttling between New York
and Washington for Roy Cohn.</i>


374
00:28:45.973 --> 00:28:49.309
<i>The young lawyer, who befriended
Private David Schine,</i>


375
00:28:49.393 --> 00:28:50.769
<i>has handed in his resignation</i>

376
00:28:50.852 --> 00:28:53.939
<i>as chief counsel to the
Senate Permanent Investigation Subcommittee</i>


377
00:28:54.022 --> 00:28:55.190
<i>headed by McCarthy.</i>

378
00:28:55.274 --> 00:28:56.358
<i>The reason?</i>

379
00:28:56.441 --> 00:29:01.863
<i>He insisted that all members of the group
want him to stay on, and this was not so.</i>


380
00:29:01.947 --> 00:29:03.198
<i>As for the future,</i>

381
00:29:03.282 --> 00:29:07.411
<i>Cohn says that he will wage a personal fight
against Communism wherever he finds it.</i>


382
00:29:23.677 --> 00:29:28.265
New York in the 1950s
was a cutthroat place to make money.


383
00:29:28.348 --> 00:29:31.852
<i>Mafia families operated pretty much
as they wanted.</i>


384
00:29:31.935 --> 00:29:34.605
<i>Cops were on the take left and right.</i>

385
00:29:34.688 --> 00:29:39.776
It was unbelievably corrupt at every level,
right up to the very top in business.


386
00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:43.530
<i>For Roy Cohn, this was Candy Land.</i>

387
00:29:48.076 --> 00:29:50.912
I think he was
trying to claw his way

388
00:29:50.996 --> 00:29:55.083
to the very top echelon of American society,
one way or the other.


389
00:30:04.259 --> 00:30:07.346
Part of New York society, at that time...

390
00:30:07.429 --> 00:30:11.558
<i>was preoccupied with getting the right table,
going to the right place,</i>


391
00:30:11.642 --> 00:30:13.769
<i>being invited to the right function.</i>

392
00:30:15.604 --> 00:30:18.607
<i>The Stork Club, 21,</i>

393
00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:21.109
<i>Danny's Hide
-A
-Way.</i>

394
00:30:22.778 --> 00:30:29.409
Roy always surrounded himself with womanizers
and the gorgeous women who came with them.


395
00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.749
<i>But Roy acted as though they weren't there.</i>

396
00:30:36.833 --> 00:30:38.627
They were really decorations.

397
00:30:44.633 --> 00:30:47.678
He became an attorney in private practice.

398
00:30:49.513 --> 00:30:51.598
<i>His partner was Thomas Bolan,</i>

399
00:30:51.682 --> 00:30:54.935
<i>who had close ties with the archdiocese
of New York.</i>


400
00:30:56.937 --> 00:30:59.398
Cohn had close ties with Cardinal Spellman.

401
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:03.151
<i>Of course, the position of the Church at that time,
as it is now,</i>


402
00:31:03.235 --> 00:31:05.529
<i>was staunchly anti
-Communist.</i>

403
00:31:06.905 --> 00:31:09.574
They needed somebody to bring business
into the firm,


404
00:31:09.658 --> 00:31:11.451
and that was Roy Cohn.

405
00:31:13.745 --> 00:31:19.209
He took his cutthroat D.C. tactics
and started applying them in corporate America,


406
00:31:19.293 --> 00:31:22.212
at the expense of everyone in his path.

407
00:31:22.296 --> 00:31:26.383
And he couldn't come back from Joe McCarthy,

408
00:31:26.466 --> 00:31:29.344
so he just embraced it more.

409
00:31:32.556 --> 00:31:35.475
<i>What you are about
to see is top secret.</i>

410
00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:41.064
<i>The first official test of the powerful
new Lionel Turbo Missile Firing Car.</i>


411
00:31:41.148 --> 00:31:45.611
<i>In the 1950s, Roy had his eye
on a family business.</i>


412
00:31:45.694 --> 00:31:51.241
His great-uncle was a Lionel,
and he had founded Lionel Trains.


413
00:31:52.242 --> 00:31:53.785
<i>It was a thriving company.</i>

414
00:31:55.245 --> 00:31:59.917
<i>Remember, boy, you're the boss
of the greatest action cars ever created</i>


415
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.544
<i>when you own Lionel trains.</i>

416
00:32:02.628 --> 00:32:07.466
<i>Roy, over the course of several months,
acquired about 200,000 shares of stock,</i>


417
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:09.801
<i>and boom, he took over the company.</i>

418
00:32:09.885 --> 00:32:13.639
<i>It took not more than a few years
until he drove it into the ground.</i>


419
00:32:13.722 --> 00:32:18.852
He was so full of himself,
and he did not care about the family.


420
00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:23.023
<i>But he was known to people as the person
who was in charge of the big company.</i>


421
00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:35.953
For a period of years, the first years I was with him,
we were a powerful law firm.


422
00:32:37.871 --> 00:32:40.749
<i>Roy was very aggressive, very smart.</i>

423
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:43.377
A very capable lawyer.

424
00:32:44.378 --> 00:32:49.925
<i>He prepared at the last minute,
but he had a perfect memory.</i>


425
00:32:51.134 --> 00:32:54.554
<i>We'd get in the limousine
going down to court, and he'd say,</i>


426
00:32:54.638 --> 00:32:56.682
"Now, tell me again, who's the client?"

427
00:32:56.765 --> 00:33:00.727
And he'd get up there like he'd been immersed
in the case for years.


428
00:33:00.811 --> 00:33:03.146
He was just that
good at what he did.

429
00:33:05.649 --> 00:33:09.319
<i>But the big picture was more complicated.</i>

430
00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.865
He just didn't play by the rule book,
and you learned that very quickly.


431
00:33:17.661 --> 00:33:21.248
<i>With time, Roy became more and more powerful,</i>

432
00:33:21.331 --> 00:33:24.209
<i>and more and more ruthless.</i>

433
00:33:24.293 --> 00:33:28.797
He subjected everybody around him
to potential criminal liability.


434
00:33:30.632 --> 00:33:33.594
<i>For example, I was, 
I think, 25 years old.</i>

435
00:33:33.677 --> 00:33:36.013
I had about $35 in the bank.

436
00:33:36.096 --> 00:33:38.974
And I was made the director
of a bank in Chicago,


437
00:33:39.057 --> 00:33:43.061
<i>as were some of our associates
for other banks.</i>


438
00:33:44.187 --> 00:33:46.732
<i>I remember the first auditor's report,</i>

439
00:33:46.815 --> 00:33:50.861
basically saying, "What happened to the money?
Where's all the money?"


440
00:33:51.612 --> 00:33:55.032
<i>There was always something
of that criminal nature going on.</i>


441
00:34:12.215 --> 00:34:14.718
<i>-Let me talk to you about your boat.
-Sure.</i>


442
00:34:14.801 --> 00:34:19.973
<i>-Okay. What did you--? The boat sunk off Florida.
-Okay, it was not my boat.</i>


443
00:34:20.056 --> 00:34:22.100
<i>It was owned by a corporation.</i>

444
00:34:22.183 --> 00:34:25.812
<i>And it was leased part-time by the firm.</i>

445
00:34:25.895 --> 00:34:30.400
<i>A crew member's killed on a boat
that many considered yours.</i>


446
00:34:30.484 --> 00:34:32.319
<i>So it was not my boat.</i>

447
00:34:39.284 --> 00:34:41.786
When I was a kid, 
I would go with my grandmother,

448
00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:46.083
because Roy would have her birthday party
on his yacht,


449
00:34:46.165 --> 00:34:48.043
<i>which was docked in the Hamptons.</i>

450
00:34:48.125 --> 00:34:49.544
<i>It was called</i>Defiance.

451
00:34:50.671 --> 00:34:54.967
<i>One year, there was this
mysterious fire on Defiance...</i>


452
00:34:56.927 --> 00:34:59.179
which happened to be insured
for a lot of money.


453
00:35:01.682 --> 00:35:04.935
<i>One of the crew members
was killed in that fire.</i>

454
00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:14.528
<i>There were serious questions about
whether Roy had a hand in burning the boat</i>


455
00:35:14.611 --> 00:35:16.405
<i>in order to get the insurance.</i>

456
00:35:18.407 --> 00:35:21.910
<i>Was it arson? 
Was Roy connected?</i>

457
00:35:26.582 --> 00:35:30.961
<i>The name of the crew member
was Charles Martensen, he was 21,</i>


458
00:35:31.044 --> 00:35:33.338
<i>and his father, who I've talked to...</i>

459
00:35:36.091 --> 00:35:40.554
<i>In effect-- Not in effect, just out and out
thinks you murdered his son.</i>


460
00:35:40.637 --> 00:35:44.641
<i>-He thinks I murdered his son?
-To get the insurance on the boat.</i>


461
00:35:44.725 --> 00:35:47.644
<i>Well, of course, let's
look at it this way.</i>

462
00:35:47.728 --> 00:35:52.149
<i>A, I didn't own the boat.
B, I didn't get the insurance.</i>


463
00:35:52.232 --> 00:35:55.402
<i>C, the statement is an outrageous falsehood.</i>

464
00:35:55.485 --> 00:35:59.865
<i>Four, how am I gonna get angry
at a man who lost his son?</i>


465
00:36:00.949 --> 00:36:04.328
<i>Couldn't be sorrier for
him and for what happened.</i>

466
00:36:07.039 --> 00:36:09.458
Like a lot of things with Roy,

467
00:36:09.541 --> 00:36:12.836
those questions haunted that case and that...

468
00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.548
The mystery of what happened
to the young man and that boat.


469
00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:24.598
It just got to a point where they were crazier
and crazier and crazier,


470
00:36:24.681 --> 00:36:26.850
culminating in his first indictment.

471
00:36:29.353 --> 00:36:35.359
<i>It was a 10-count indictment,
charging me with perjury,</i>


472
00:36:35.442 --> 00:36:41.990
obstruction of justice and with a conspiracy
to commit perjury and to obstruct justice.


473
00:36:42.074 --> 00:36:45.077
It was about a 48-page-long indictment.

474
00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:49.581
Everything bad that happened to Roy
during my years at his firm


475
00:36:49.665 --> 00:36:54.336
<i>was attributed to Robert Morgenthau,
who was then the U.S. attorney.</i>


476
00:36:54.419 --> 00:36:59.758
<i>Cohn viewed all the three Morgenthau indictments
as a vendetta.</i>


477
00:36:59.841 --> 00:37:01.677
And it was a very public dispute.

478
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:10.894
If there's a defendant around who hasn't been
propositioned by Mr. Morgenthau's office


479
00:37:10.978 --> 00:37:16.858
to furnish some kind of information on me
in return for a deal, I haven't met him.


480
00:37:16.942 --> 00:37:20.445
He's the only person I've ever met
who actually enjoyed being indicted,


481
00:37:20.529 --> 00:37:22.948
because it gave him a platform to attack.

482
00:37:23.031 --> 00:37:26.326
<i>A federal grand jury in New York today
indicted Roy Cohn</i>


483
00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:28.912
<i>on charges of fraud and conspiracy.</i>

484
00:37:28.996 --> 00:37:32.291
<i>Cohn could be sentenced
to 38 years in jail</i>

485
00:37:32.374 --> 00:37:36.878
<i>and fined $55,000 if convicted on all counts.</i>

486
00:37:36.962 --> 00:37:41.550
I can't imagine the kind of pressure
he was under while this was going on,


487
00:37:41.633 --> 00:37:44.094
<i>but he never showed it.</i>

488
00:37:44.177 --> 00:37:47.389
There was a confidence about him
that was unshakable.


489
00:37:48.932 --> 00:37:52.311
<i>He managed to get out of legal difficulties</i>

490
00:37:52.394 --> 00:37:55.897
<i>in ways that almost
no other lawyer could have.</i>

491
00:37:57.065 --> 00:37:58.734
He was a legal magician.

492
00:37:58.817 --> 00:38:00.944
<i>If Mr. Morgenthau were being honest,</i>

493
00:38:01.028 --> 00:38:04.906
<i>he could have done this at the same time
he did the last indictment 60 days ago.</i>


494
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:10.537
But if he did it that way, he wouldn't have been able
to get two smear news stories against me,


495
00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:12.372
which is just what he likes to do.

496
00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:13.874
And after this third indictment,

497
00:38:13.957 --> 00:38:16.376
I don't think there are
too many people left around

498
00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:21.798
who don't realize that this all
is Mr. Morgenthau's vendetta.


499
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:28.180
<i>In his own trial involving the Fifth Avenue
Coach Company,</i>


500
00:38:28.263 --> 00:38:30.682
<i>his lawyer had a heart attack.</i>

501
00:38:31.725 --> 00:38:35.687
<i>Roy got up and delivered his own defense.</i>

502
00:38:35.771 --> 00:38:40.192
Seven hours of his own defense
without looking at a note.


503
00:38:41.276 --> 00:38:44.780
<i>Cohn kept appealing to patriotism.</i>

504
00:38:44.863 --> 00:38:48.116
<i>He said, "I love
the United States of America,</i>

505
00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:52.496
<i>and I can't believe that most of the people
in this great country</i>


506
00:38:52.579 --> 00:38:56.041
<i>think that I could
ever commit a criminal act."</i>

507
00:38:57.751 --> 00:39:00.337
He's just lying to save his skin.

508
00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:05.342
<i>It had a tremendous impact on the jury.</i>

509
00:39:05.425 --> 00:39:10.973
<i>The foreman of the jury came back the next day
wearing an American flag in his lapel.</i>


510
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:16.186
And he was acquitted.
I mean, he was really the Teflon fraud.


511
00:39:19.731 --> 00:39:23.610
This is just the most relieved and happy moment
of my life.


512
00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:25.487
And the way I feel is

513
00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:28.782
the way I feel every day in my life,
which is God bless America.


514
00:39:50.721 --> 00:39:56.018
<i>Roy Cohn understood the political value
of wrapping yourself in the flag.</i>


515
00:39:58.145 --> 00:40:04.526
It's not surprising that he would meet with reporters
and say, "God bless America."


516
00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:06.778
He always made very good copy.

517
00:40:27.883 --> 00:40:32.512
Cohn was, in part, powerful
not just because he was a good lawyer


518
00:40:32.596 --> 00:40:33.972
and a killer lawyer.

519
00:40:34.056 --> 00:40:36.475
He was also powerful
because he had press relationships.


520
00:40:36.558 --> 00:40:41.480
<i>And the press was beholden to him
because he was feeding them information.</i>


521
00:40:42.814 --> 00:40:46.068
This gave him a dimension
beyond just being a lawyer.


522
00:40:46.151 --> 00:40:50.572
Roy knew how to shape events
that he was involved in


523
00:40:50.656 --> 00:40:53.909
<i>through his manipulation of the press.</i>

524
00:40:56.411 --> 00:41:00.207
<i>Roy Cohn had learned his lessons
from the McCarthy era well.</i>


525
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:04.169
He learned the press will accurately quote
whatever you say.


526
00:41:04.253 --> 00:41:06.713
<i>The headlines and the top of the story,</i>

527
00:41:06.797 --> 00:41:09.466
<i>and a lot of people don't read
beyond the first few paragraphs,</i>


528
00:41:09.549 --> 00:41:11.969
<i>would be your version of events.</i>

529
00:41:14.304 --> 00:41:18.558
Cohn had a coterie of reporters,

530
00:41:18.642 --> 00:41:23.272
sort of the predecessors and precursors
of Fox News,


531
00:41:23.355 --> 00:41:25.732
<i>to whom he would leak information.</i>

532
00:41:29.069 --> 00:41:33.573
<i>He would sit back at the dining-room table,
and he would actually dictate copy</i>


533
00:41:33.657 --> 00:41:36.285
for both the <i>New
York Post</i>and the Daily News.

534
00:41:36.368 --> 00:41:42.040
<i>"Period, paragraph, new paragraph,
comma, exclamation point."</i>


535
00:41:42.124 --> 00:41:44.167
I've never seen anybody do that.

536
00:41:49.506 --> 00:41:54.177
From the very beginning,
he tried to co-opt me.

537
00:41:54.261 --> 00:41:58.515
He would give me horrible items about people,

538
00:41:58.599 --> 00:42:01.560
<i>and I wouldn't pay any attention.</i>

539
00:42:03.186 --> 00:42:07.065
But he did tell me
a lot of incredible things.

540
00:42:14.239 --> 00:42:17.200
He was consumed with a driving force

541
00:42:17.284 --> 00:42:21.580
<i>to make himself famous,
to be with famous people,</i>


542
00:42:21.663 --> 00:42:23.582
<i>to make himself powerful.</i>

543
00:42:25.125 --> 00:42:26.793
That was where the motives were.

544
00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:47.773
<i>In 1927, Roy's uncle,</i>

545
00:42:47.856 --> 00:42:51.777
<i>Bernie Marcus, owned
the Bank of United States.</i>


546
00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:55.530
The Depression comes, and, of course,
many banks had trouble.


547
00:42:56.657 --> 00:42:59.493
<i>When the stock market failed,</i>

548
00:42:59.576 --> 00:43:03.330
the Bank of United States
was the first big bank to fail.


549
00:43:05.874 --> 00:43:07.751
<i>There was a run on the bank.</i>

550
00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:12.589
<i>The only banks big
enough to cover this run</i>

551
00:43:12.673 --> 00:43:15.467
were the Morgan banks or the Rockefeller banks.

552
00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:19.596
But they said something to the effect, "We don't
care about the Jewish bank. Let them go."


553
00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:24.351
<i>There's crowds in the streets,
the bank is closed, the doors are locked.</i>


554
00:43:24.434 --> 00:43:26.770
<i>The immigrants lost all their money.</i>

555
00:43:26.853 --> 00:43:30.983
It was tragic in the Jewish community.
It was tragic for the country.


556
00:43:31.984 --> 00:43:36.071
<i>My grandfather, Bernie Marcus,
was hauled away to Sing Sing.</i>


557
00:43:36.154 --> 00:43:38.907
And that was the ultimate disgrace.

558
00:43:40.742 --> 00:43:45.664
The social shame of that to the family
was enormously deep.


559
00:43:45.747 --> 00:43:49.751
<i>Thrown out of every country club,
thrown out of the Harmonie Club.</i>


560
00:43:50.877 --> 00:43:54.756
There was a lot wrong with the trial
that ended up putting Bernie in prison.


561
00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.635
<i>And Roy had said that if he were
Bernie's attorney at the time,</i>


562
00:43:58.719 --> 00:44:01.221
<i>he would have gotten him off,
and probably could have.</i>


563
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:08.478
<i>That failure of his Uncle Bernie
was a huge part of what motivated Roy.</i>


564
00:44:08.562 --> 00:44:14.735
He had to let people know that although
his uncle had lost it, he had made it.


565
00:44:26.663 --> 00:44:29.041
<i>Roy had a huge standard of living.</i>

566
00:44:29.124 --> 00:44:32.961
Boats, planes, the best table

567
00:44:33.045 --> 00:44:36.048
at the 21 Club or the Stork Club.

568
00:44:37.549 --> 00:44:41.094
<i>And the firm paid,
because they were all business-related.</i>


569
00:44:43.388 --> 00:44:48.393
<i>You know, Roy was never a partner in the firm.
That didn't mean anything to him.</i>


570
00:44:48.477 --> 00:44:51.813
He was Roy Cohn. 
I mean, he's the chief.

571
00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:56.151
<i>This was the '60s and '70s,</i>

572
00:44:56.234 --> 00:44:59.529
when fame was becoming
everything in New York.


573
00:44:59.613 --> 00:45:03.492
<i>And this was part of his need
to have these very wealthy friends.</i>


574
00:45:04.534 --> 00:45:07.496
<i>His need to have a Rolls-Royce
and let everybody know it.</i>


575
00:45:08.497 --> 00:45:11.959
<i>Actually, he had two Rolls
-Royces.</i>

576
00:45:12.042 --> 00:45:15.879
<i>One that was a convertible.
He always wanted the sun.</i>


577
00:45:15.963 --> 00:45:18.632
And to look like he just
came out of Miami Beach.


578
00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:26.181
I think it was Aristotle Onassis who said,
"You can never be too rich or too tan."


579
00:45:26.265 --> 00:45:28.558
Roy Cohn took this to heart.

580
00:45:30.394 --> 00:45:33.939
<i>He had a speedboat,
and often during the summer,</i>


581
00:45:34.022 --> 00:45:37.734
<i>he would take a bunch
of us up to 79th Street.</i>

582
00:45:37.818 --> 00:45:41.863
Now, the Hudson River was
so polluted in the late '60s.


583
00:45:41.947 --> 00:45:45.117
I mean, nobody would go

584
00:45:45.909 --> 00:45:47.995
<i>And he went waterskiing.</i>

585
00:45:48.078 --> 00:45:50.497
<i>And we went under
the George Washington Bridge.</i>


586
00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:56.253
It was perfect Roy Cohn.
It was the way he lived, bigger than life.


587
00:46:05.929 --> 00:46:09.057
<i>Roy took a house in Mexico every year.</i>

588
00:46:09.141 --> 00:46:12.769
And every time I would go there
to meet with Roy,


589
00:46:12.853 --> 00:46:15.480
<i>there'd be a knock on
my door at the office,</i>

590
00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:22.946
and his mother Dora would bring me
some jockey shorts and cans of tuna fish.


591
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:26.033
So Roy would have what
he liked all the time.

592
00:46:27.951 --> 00:46:32.164
<i>His mother took care of him.
With her, it was, "Did you eat your breakfast?"</i>


593
00:46:32.247 --> 00:46:35.709
"Don't listen to him.
He's wrong. You're right, Roy."

594
00:46:35.792 --> 00:46:38.503
Bucking him up, always supporting him.

595
00:46:38.587 --> 00:46:41.131
<i>He became a little boy around his mother.</i>

596
00:46:41.214 --> 00:46:44.760
I gather he lived in fear of Dora
knowing that he was gay.


597
00:46:44.843 --> 00:46:48.639
Now, that's an odd thing,
because he was in his 30s and 40s,


598
00:46:48.722 --> 00:46:50.223
but Dora chose not to see it.

599
00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:57.814
After his mother died,
things changed very rapidly.


600
00:46:57.898 --> 00:47:01.026
A fellow who drove his car disappeared.

601
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:03.654
There was a new driver, much more handsome.

602
00:47:04.905 --> 00:47:07.449
<i>And there was a
new captain of the yacht,</i>

603
00:47:07.532 --> 00:47:09.242
<i>also much more handsome.</i>

604
00:47:11.787 --> 00:47:15.290
<i>Roy was hung up on a specific type.</i>

605
00:47:16.375 --> 00:47:19.586
I was his epitome of looks,
like, you know, the very...


606
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:24.258
He liked blond-haired, you know,
Nordic look, like David Schine.


607
00:47:27.344 --> 00:47:31.348
Even the lawyers he would hire--
They were straight,


608
00:47:31.431 --> 00:47:35.102
but they were that type of look.

609
00:47:37.813 --> 00:47:41.108
Roy and the law firm
of Saxe, Bacon and Bolan


610
00:47:41.191 --> 00:47:44.653
<i>moved into an Upper East Side townhouse.</i>

611
00:47:44.736 --> 00:47:46.363
<i>On East 68th Street,</i>

612
00:47:46.446 --> 00:47:48.824
<i>which was an awfully fancy block.</i>

613
00:47:48.907 --> 00:47:51.743
I believe it was between Madison and Park.

614
00:47:52.828 --> 00:47:56.498
<i>The idea that it was an office and a residence
was a little unusual.</i>


615
00:47:57.291 --> 00:47:59.334
<i>You'd meet in the living room.</i>

616
00:47:59.418 --> 00:48:01.795
Or you'd meet in his bedroom, which was,

617
00:48:01.878 --> 00:48:04.089
I think, on the
fourth floor of the building.

618
00:48:04.172 --> 00:48:06.842
He'd be in a bathrobe, and he--

619
00:48:06.925 --> 00:48:08.885
That's the way business was conducted.

620
00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:12.055
<i>What I saw were two Cohns.</i>

621
00:48:12.139 --> 00:48:16.685
<i>In a suit and tie,
he was Roy Cohn, killer lawyer.</i>


622
00:48:17.936 --> 00:48:19.313
At his apartment...

623
00:48:20.314 --> 00:48:24.151
<i>I remember thinking,
this is a different Roy Cohn.</i>


624
00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:26.278
He's letting himself be.

625
00:48:33.243 --> 00:48:37.623
<i>My recorder is going, and I said,
"Roy, let me ask you a question."</i>


626
00:48:37.706 --> 00:48:41.501
<i>Many people who I've talked to
have said to me,</i>


627
00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:44.630
<i>"Do you know that Roy is a homosexual?"</i>

628
00:48:48.133 --> 00:48:49.927
<i>Long pause.</i>

629
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:53.847
He didn't answer for seconds.
I mean, maybe five, six seconds.


630
00:48:56.475 --> 00:48:58.310
<i>I would answer you this way.</i>

631
00:48:58.393 --> 00:49:01.688
<i>Anybody who knows me,
or knows anything about me,</i>


632
00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:04.149
<i>or who knows the way my mind works,</i>

633
00:49:04.232 --> 00:49:07.778
<i>would have an awfully hard time reconciling...</i>

634
00:49:09.071 --> 00:49:13.700
<i>that with any kind of homosexuality.</i>

635
00:49:14.618 --> 00:49:18.288
<i>In other words, every facet of my personality,</i>

636
00:49:18.372 --> 00:49:23.168
<i>my aggressiveness and my toughness,
and everything along those lines,</i>


637
00:49:23.252 --> 00:49:29.341
<i>is just totally, I suppose,
incompatible with anything like that.</i>


638
00:49:29.424 --> 00:49:32.719
<i>But he didn't say he was,
he didn't say he wasn't.</i>


639
00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:34.471
<i>But he squirmed,</i>

640
00:49:34.554 --> 00:49:37.015
which gave me great amount of pleasure.

641
00:49:38.016 --> 00:49:41.144
Because in a way, 
I was doing to him,

642
00:49:41.228 --> 00:49:43.230
in this personal interview,

643
00:49:43.313 --> 00:49:45.774
what he had done to people
in the McCarthy hearings,


644
00:49:45.857 --> 00:49:49.278
putting them on the spot. "Are you now,
or have you ever been a Communist?"


645
00:49:52.614 --> 00:49:55.534
I wanna ask you about this.
To me, the nicest thing...


646
00:49:55.617 --> 00:49:57.286
Let's be affirmative.

647
00:49:57.369 --> 00:50:00.497
The nicest thing that I have
ever heard about Joe McCarthy


648
00:50:00.581 --> 00:50:03.041
was told me by Senator Flanders of Vermont,

649
00:50:03.125 --> 00:50:06.044
that he was a
full-time homosexual. Is this true?

650
00:50:06.128 --> 00:50:08.839
No. I'm sure you think
that merited a badge of honor,


651
00:50:08.922 --> 00:50:10.048
but it is not true.

652
00:50:10.132 --> 00:50:13.218
Well, I'm getting to you in a minute,
but what about Senator McCarthy?


653
00:50:13.302 --> 00:50:16.555
Sure, you... I mean, that's your favorite topic
of conversation, I know that.


654
00:50:16.638 --> 00:50:19.683
-By the way-- I know.
-I know-- Just aroused by the obvious.


655
00:50:20.767 --> 00:50:23.061
<i>He was a very hypocritical guy.</i>

656
00:50:23.145 --> 00:50:26.231
<i>He was engaged for
a while to Barbara Walters.</i>

657
00:50:26.315 --> 00:50:28.525
We're getting married when we're both 60.

658
00:50:29.735 --> 00:50:33.572
She and Roy had grown up together,

659
00:50:33.655 --> 00:50:36.491
<i>and she never deserted him.</i>

660
00:50:36.575 --> 00:50:39.745
<i>But she was annoyed by Roy going around</i>

661
00:50:39.828 --> 00:50:43.040
saying he was gonna marry her.

662
00:50:43.123 --> 00:50:45.500
She knew that was absurd.

663
00:50:49.338 --> 00:50:53.508
This is a guy who ostensibly was a multimillionaire,
one of the most powerful people in New York.


664
00:50:53.592 --> 00:50:57.429
<i>There was a little Disney sign
that said "Roy" on it on his bedroom door.</i>


665
00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:00.724
The door opened-
- I only saw it once,

666
00:51:00.807 --> 00:51:02.684
but the door opened,
and there was a mirror.

667
00:51:02.768 --> 00:51:06.313
I was young. I didn't know that people
had mirrors on the ceilings of their bedrooms.


668
00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:11.318
<i>So there was a mirror there, a huge bed,
and there were just people in and out all day long.</i>


669
00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:15.405
<i>Which is also a kind of recreation room
and office and gallery</i>


670
00:51:15.489 --> 00:51:17.407
<i>for his collection of frogs.</i>

671
00:51:17.491 --> 00:51:21.828
Roy had a lot of miniature animals
and stuffed animals


672
00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:23.246
and things that...

673
00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:26.458
In his apartment that you wouldn't expect...

674
00:51:28.043 --> 00:51:29.336
a killer lawyer to have.

675
00:51:29.419 --> 00:51:31.630
<i>He admits to a certain vanity,</i>

676
00:51:31.713 --> 00:51:34.800
<i>religious about doing
his 200 sit-ups every day.</i>


677
00:51:34.883 --> 00:51:39.471
<i>All this while dictating to his male secretary,
Vincent Millard.</i>


678
00:51:39.554 --> 00:51:41.932
Did you remember I had a lunch date
with Barbara Walters?


679
00:51:42.015 --> 00:51:43.267
-When is that?
-Today.


680
00:51:45.519 --> 00:51:48.605
Every time I had a meal with him,
he didn't order very much,


681
00:51:48.689 --> 00:51:50.691
and sometimes he didn't order.

682
00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:53.986
With his fingers,
he would take food off my plate.


683
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:57.906
If you're Roy and you're always doing exercise
and you're always staying thin,


684
00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:00.742
and yet you eat off of somebody's plate,
it doesn't count.


685
00:52:00.826 --> 00:52:02.244
It's like everything in his life.

686
00:52:02.327 --> 00:52:06.039
There was this image, and then there was reality,
which totally contradicted it.


687
00:52:08.834 --> 00:52:11.670
<i>He had a really bad facelift,</i>

688
00:52:11.753 --> 00:52:17.092
with these enormous gashes,
and stitches on the side of his face.


689
00:52:17.175 --> 00:52:20.887
You'd say, "Roy, did you have surgery?"
And he said, "No, not me.


690
00:52:20.971 --> 00:52:22.681
Why? I feel fine."

691
00:52:22.764 --> 00:52:26.018
<i>So, I mean, he would even deny
that he'd had this surgery</i>


692
00:52:26.101 --> 00:52:29.146
<i>when he should have been home in bed
with ice on it.</i>


693
00:52:29.605 --> 00:52:32.107
<i>He was very vain in that sense.</i>

694
00:52:34.526 --> 00:52:36.820
<i>There was a strange contradiction about Roy.</i>

695
00:52:36.903 --> 00:52:40.741
He was totally ugly
and totally charismatic at the same time.


696
00:52:53.462 --> 00:52:57.466
<i>A lot of people say they see you
with a lot of good-looking young men.</i>


697
00:52:58.508 --> 00:53:01.929
<i>I like young people.
There's no question about that.</i>


698
00:53:02.012 --> 00:53:05.098
<i>I like being around young people.
They're more fun.</i>


699
00:53:10.646 --> 00:53:16.151
The people that he had sex with
were not very well-educated,


700
00:53:16.234 --> 00:53:19.488
did not come from good families.

701
00:53:19.571 --> 00:53:23.283
<i>That was a separate part of his life.</i>

702
00:53:27.454 --> 00:53:29.873
<i>He had to have sex every day.
Every day.</i>


703
00:53:29.957 --> 00:53:32.292
And preferably with someone who was new.

704
00:53:38.507 --> 00:53:40.467
He took a lot of Valium.

705
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:45.806
<i>He'd get so frustrated
with those childproof bottles.</i>


706
00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:48.558
He'd always... "Can you open this thing?"

707
00:53:48.642 --> 00:53:52.187
And it wasn't, like, one pill. It was, like,
just dump them in there and take them.


708
00:53:55.983 --> 00:53:59.569
<i>In the end of the evening,
I went to take my coat,</i>


709
00:53:59.653 --> 00:54:03.740
and it was, like,
stuffed full of hundred-dollar bills.

710
00:54:03.824 --> 00:54:07.619
Every time I reached into a pocket,
there was several hundred-dollar bills.


711
00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:13.834
<i>When everyone left,</i>

712
00:54:13.917 --> 00:54:17.045
I would go in and lay down
on the bed with him,


713
00:54:17.129 --> 00:54:19.548
and, like, I'd look up at the mirror,

714
00:54:19.631 --> 00:54:22.259
and he would look up at the mirror,
and we would talk.


715
00:54:25.012 --> 00:54:28.098
<i>I asked him, "So are
you the girl or the boy?"</i>

716
00:54:28.181 --> 00:54:30.017
<i>And he said, "I'm the girl."</i>

717
00:54:33.312 --> 00:54:38.567
<i>There were rumors that he was picking up
male prostitutes all around the city.</i>


718
00:54:47.409 --> 00:54:50.912
He was really a personality in disarray.

719
00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:54.583
<i>A personality in anarchy.</i>

720
00:54:56.919 --> 00:55:02.132
<i>Which had no rules, it had no scruples,
it had no boundaries.</i>


721
00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:07.429
<i>He was someone who lived on the edge.</i>

722
00:55:07.512 --> 00:55:11.266
And he enjoyed living on the edge,
because it was dangerous.


723
00:55:36.792 --> 00:55:39.795
<i>The power politics of New York,
the favor bank,</i>


724
00:55:39.878 --> 00:55:42.631
<i>was very closely linked
to organized crime.</i>


725
00:55:42.714 --> 00:55:47.219
And this was a milieu
in which Roy Cohn fit in perfectly.


726
00:55:47.302 --> 00:55:49.638
-Then tell me what direction.
-You got 50 people here...


727
00:55:49.721 --> 00:55:52.057
<i>Cohn began to represent mobsters.</i>

728
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:55.477
He represented
all of the New York families


729
00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:57.771
that controlled La Cosa Nostra.

730
00:56:04.903 --> 00:56:09.324
<i>Galante arrived at the federal courthouse
in a long black limousine and walked inside,</i>


731
00:56:09.408 --> 00:56:12.202
<i>shielded from photographers
by two of his daughters.</i>


732
00:56:13.495 --> 00:56:14.705
Stop it. Please!

733
00:56:14.788 --> 00:56:19.376
<i>Galante is now regarded by federal authorities
as one of the most important men in the Mafia.</i>


734
00:56:21.378 --> 00:56:23.797
-Come on, Daddy, run!
-What are you doing here today, sir?


735
00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:28.510
Turn around and roll, Frank.

736
00:56:28.594 --> 00:56:32.806
-Come on, baby. Let's go. Let's go.
-Stop pushing me!


737
00:56:37.728 --> 00:56:39.396
-Are you Mr. Galante's attorney?
-Yeah.


738
00:56:39.479 --> 00:56:41.315
-And what is your name, sir?
-Roy Cohn.


739
00:56:41.398 --> 00:56:45.027
Federal investigator said Mr. Galante
is the boss of organized crime in this country.


740
00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:48.363
Would that be a correct characterization,
the godfather of the New York Mafia?


741
00:56:48.447 --> 00:56:53.869
From my experience, practically everything
they've said is totally incorrect and inaccurate.


742
00:56:53.952 --> 00:56:56.663
-You believe they're not treating your client fairly?
-Pardon me?


743
00:56:56.747 --> 00:57:01.043
No, I just said it's just a total publicity stunt,
or all of you wouldn't be here, right?


744
00:57:01.126 --> 00:57:03.211
What are you doing here today?

745
00:57:03.295 --> 00:57:04.379
I'm a lawyer.

746
00:57:05.797 --> 00:57:10.719
He was very clever in protecting his clients,
by far and large,


747
00:57:10.802 --> 00:57:14.640
from long criminal sentences
that would put them out of business.


748
00:57:17.976 --> 00:57:23.649
<i>Roy was assigned by the Gambino Crime Family
to represent John Gotti.</i>


749
00:57:23.732 --> 00:57:27.152
When Gotti and a couple of his guys

750
00:57:27.235 --> 00:57:29.071
walked into a bar

751
00:57:29.154 --> 00:57:34.826
<i>in front of a lot of witnesses
and shot this guy in the head and killed him,</i>


752
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:37.663
<i>Roy managed to get Gotti off.</i>

753
00:57:37.746 --> 00:57:40.707
<i>Instead of 25 to life on a murder,</i>

754
00:57:40.791 --> 00:57:44.336
<i>got him into some degree of manslaughter</i>

755
00:57:44.419 --> 00:57:48.173
<i>and Gotti ended up
serving only two years in prison.</i>


756
00:57:49.174 --> 00:57:51.385
<i>Amazing that he did that.</i>

757
00:57:51.468 --> 00:57:56.515
An excellent result for Gotti
and a great injustice at the same time.


758
00:57:57.683 --> 00:58:03.981
<i>As a result of that case,
Roy had a perpetual client of the Mafia.</i>


759
00:58:08.735 --> 00:58:13.740
<i>Tony Salerno, recently indicted,
has long been one of Roy Cohn's clients.</i>


760
00:58:13.824 --> 00:58:17.119
Tony, you've read the charges
in this indictment.


761
00:58:17.202 --> 00:58:21.081
-Did you do any of those things to anyone?
-All false.


762
00:58:21.164 --> 00:58:24.167
<i>Cohn was more an advisor.</i>

763
00:58:24.251 --> 00:58:29.631
He was the guy who whispered in the ear
of the don and told him what to say, what to do.


764
00:58:29.715 --> 00:58:31.883
He was full of advice.

765
00:58:31.967 --> 00:58:34.011
What're you gonna do
when you get to the country?


766
00:58:34.094 --> 00:58:37.598
Well, I mean, I planted peppers last week.
Now I'm gonna plant tomatoes.


767
00:58:37.681 --> 00:58:41.435
<i>His name is Carmine Galante,
the late Carmine Galante,</i>


768
00:58:41.518 --> 00:58:44.855
<i>who the papers said
was the godfather of the Mafia.</i>


769
00:58:44.938 --> 00:58:47.399
You think that had an influence
on the federal judge,


770
00:58:47.482 --> 00:58:49.651
when he held that you were right
and the Parole Commission was wrong?


771
00:58:49.735 --> 00:58:52.237
-I think so.
-He thinks a farmer ought to be able to seed.


772
00:58:52.321 --> 00:58:56.533
I think so. I mean, it's very well known
that that's what I do.


773
00:58:56.617 --> 00:59:01.788
<i>A few months after this meeting,
he was gunned down as he sipped a glass of wine.</i>


774
00:59:11.423 --> 00:59:13.508
<i>Present for the service was Roy Cohn,</i>

775
00:59:13.592 --> 00:59:18.305
<i>who had been Galante's lawyer
through many of the mobster's legal difficulties.</i>


776
00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:21.016
I pass no moral judgment on Mr. Galante

777
00:59:21.099 --> 00:59:23.685
any more than I pass a moral judgment
on anybody else,


778
00:59:23.769 --> 00:59:26.480
because that's for the Almighty to do,
not for me.


779
00:59:26.563 --> 00:59:28.440
Do you have any
idea why he was murdered?

780
00:59:29.983 --> 00:59:33.820
As somebody once said a long time ago is,
"All I know is what I read in the papers."


781
00:59:37.658 --> 00:59:42.120
<i>The Mafia was the entire
power underbelly of the city.</i>


782
00:59:42.204 --> 00:59:45.540
And Roy had all of
the network at his disposal.

783
00:59:51.463 --> 00:59:55.425
<i>Steinbrenner would be on line one,
and Carmine Galante would be on line two,</i>


784
00:59:55.509 --> 00:59:59.096
<i>and some Mafia boss who had
a cement company would be on line three,</i>


785
00:59:59.179 --> 01:00:02.015
<i>and somebody would be waiting,
Roger Stone would be in the anteroom.</i>


786
01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:05.102
<i>And Roy wanted that attention.</i>

787
01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:12.567
<i>He was an only child
whose mother doted on him every second.</i>


788
01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:16.405
And he needed that attention
years after she died.


789
01:00:21.159 --> 01:00:23.620
<i>There's a story about Dora</i>

790
01:00:23.704 --> 01:00:27.708
that gives you a pretty good insight
into Roy's relationship with his mother


791
01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:30.043
and into how Roy operated.

792
01:00:34.423 --> 01:00:38.969
Every Jewish family has its own Passover story,
and our story is an unusual one.


793
01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:45.517
I was the youngest child, and as such,
I had to ask the Four Questions.


794
01:00:45.601 --> 01:00:49.104
<i>First question was,
"Why is this night different from all others?"</i>


795
01:00:49.187 --> 01:00:51.565
And Dora finally blurted out...

796
01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:55.902
"Why is this night different?
Because the maid's dead in the kitchen!"


797
01:00:57.696 --> 01:01:02.284
Turns out the housekeeper passed away,
was in the kitchen, dead.


798
01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:07.205
<i>And in order not
to disrupt the Passover dinner,</i>

799
01:01:07.289 --> 01:01:11.835
Dora saw to it that the housekeeper
was kept in the kitchen under the serving table.


800
01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:19.426
She was embarrassed about how it interrupted
the Seder, not the fact that a life had been lost.


801
01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:26.266
<i>That's totally Roy's spirit.</i>

802
01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:29.603
<i>His lack of ethics, his lack of empathy.</i>

803
01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:30.979
<i>That came from Dora.</i>

804
01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:35.025
<i>For Roy, life was transactional.</i>

805
01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:38.153
It was all about connections and accruing power.

806
01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:45.494
<i>If I said to you,
"Roy Cohn, what are your flaws?"</i>

807
01:01:45.577 --> 01:01:46.870
<i>What are my flaws?</i>

808
01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.707
<i>Okay, I'll tell you what my flaws are.</i>

809
01:01:50.791 --> 01:01:55.045
<i>My flaws are being completely tactless.</i>

810
01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:58.632
<i>I cannot listen to baloney. 
Impatience.</i>

811
01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:06.556
<i>A total failure to sympathize
with the emotional element in life.</i>


812
01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:42.551
The biggest business in New York then,
and it probably still is now, was real estate.


813
01:02:42.634 --> 01:02:45.095
<i>That's where the real power was.</i>

814
01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:50.392
He represented a number of real-estate figures,
among them Donald Trump.


815
01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:56.940
<i>Donald Trump grows up in a household
where his father Fred is deeply mobbed up.</i>


816
01:02:57.024 --> 01:02:59.484
His business partner, 
Willie Tomasello,

817
01:02:59.568 --> 01:03:03.155
is an associate of the Gambino
and Genovese crime families.


818
01:03:03.238 --> 01:03:06.116
So Donald comes to Manhattan
to make a name for himself.


819
01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:09.953
He naturally gravitates toward Roy Cohn,

820
01:03:10.037 --> 01:03:16.043
the consigliere for the head of the Gambino family
and the head of the Genovese family.


821
01:03:17.336 --> 01:03:18.670
Short answers or...?

822
01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.299
Well, whatever you'd like. 
It doesn't matter.

823
01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:25.844
-I'm not as long as Archbishop O'Connor, but...
-No one is.


824
01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:29.348
Mr. Cohn, how did you meet Donald Trump?

825
01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:34.353
I met him at a
New York club called Le Club.

826
01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:37.814
And we were seated at tables next to each other.
We were introduced.


827
01:03:37.898 --> 01:03:40.484
He was 23 years old then. 
He said, "Listen."

828
01:03:40.567 --> 01:03:44.154
He said, "I've spent two days
with these establishment law firms


829
01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:45.447
about a case we have."

830
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:47.741
It was a civil-rights case or something.

831
01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:52.079
"And they were all telling us, give up,
do this, sign a decree and all of that."


832
01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:54.206
He says, "I followed your career,
and you seem...


833
01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:58.752
You're a little bit crazy like I am,
and you stand up to the establishment.


834
01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:00.545
Can I come see
you?" And I said, "Sure."

835
01:04:02.464 --> 01:04:05.968
<i>The Justice Department
was going after Fred Trump and Donald Trump</i>


836
01:04:06.051 --> 01:04:09.137
<i>for not letting blacks in their housing.</i>

837
01:04:09.221 --> 01:04:12.766
<i>Rather than making a deal,
rather than admitting guilt,</i>


838
01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:17.271
Roy said to Trump, "You need to go full-bore
after the Justice Department."


839
01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:20.524
<i>Roy Cohn was very
clear what to do: attack.</i>

840
01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:24.486
Don't settle. Don't apologize. Attack.

841
01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:27.739
Roy would always be for an offensive strategy.

842
01:04:27.823 --> 01:04:29.616
Those are the rules of war.

843
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:33.412
You don't fight on the other guy's ground.
You define what the debate is gonna be about.


844
01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:38.834
<i>I think Donald learned that from Roy.
I learned that from Roy.</i>


845
01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:45.299
Roy Cohn began this whole new mode
of what you see today, of get off the issue,


846
01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:49.553
attack law enforcement,
attack the government, attack the press.


847
01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:53.682
<i>Create phony issues
so that you can totally change the debate.</i>


848
01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:57.311
-Here's a little McCarthyism going on right now.
-He shouldn't disclaim--


849
01:04:57.394 --> 01:05:01.690
I mean, total inability to cope
with any of these current topics.


850
01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:05.527
-He does it with great... With great pre...
-Keep talking, Roy. Keep talking.


851
01:05:05.611 --> 01:05:07.195
-Great precision.
-Keep talking.


852
01:05:07.279 --> 01:05:10.282
-This is known as "filler." You know, what... You...
-Well, I...


853
01:05:10.365 --> 01:05:14.244
You throw your mud, and then the filler goes on
until they've forgotten what the point was.


854
01:05:14.328 --> 01:05:19.124
<i>They counterclaimed
against the government for $100 million.</i>


855
01:05:19.207 --> 01:05:22.169
Now, the counterclaim was soon dismissed,

856
01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:25.047
but had the effect
of keeping the opponent off balance.


857
01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:27.674
We fought it, and we did extremely well.

858
01:05:27.758 --> 01:05:29.968
For all practical purposes,
we won the case together.


859
01:05:31.345 --> 01:05:35.974
<i>Trump settled, but that, for him, was a victory,
because he didn't admit he did anything wrong.</i>


860
01:05:36.058 --> 01:05:39.061
And it's very consistent with Roy's advice.

861
01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:44.524
"Never admit you're wrong. 
Never apologize."

862
01:05:44.608 --> 01:05:46.193
Settling is not an apology.

863
01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:47.945
In fact, Donald Trump, when he settles,

864
01:05:48.028 --> 01:05:52.366
he oftentimes will cast the settlement
as a victory, not a defeat.


865
01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:53.951
Ever since that day,

866
01:05:54.034 --> 01:06:00.415
he knows I have the same kind of crazy fight in me
that he has in him,


867
01:06:00.499 --> 01:06:01.875
and he knows that...

868
01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:04.294
He believes you can fight city hall.

869
01:06:04.378 --> 01:06:06.588
I believe you can fight city hall.

870
01:06:06.672 --> 01:06:08.715
And we both fought it together.

871
01:06:08.799 --> 01:06:12.928
Cohn looked at Donald Trump
as something of a protégé.


872
01:06:13.011 --> 01:06:15.806
<i>He saw him as a man</i>

873
01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:20.269
<i>who was governed
by the same sort of situational ethics.</i>


874
01:06:20.352 --> 01:06:23.939
<i>They were cut from the same cloth,
in many respects.</i>


875
01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.818
Roy Cohn begins teaching Donald,

876
01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:31.238
"Here's how you keep law enforcement
off your back.


877
01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:34.157
Don't leave a paper trail. 
Don't keep a calendar.

878
01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:36.702
Never do things in writing.

879
01:06:36.785 --> 01:06:40.205
And if somebody gets onto you,
rat out other people."


880
01:06:40.289 --> 01:06:42.874
Steve, you're gonna have to start pushing
these people a bit,


881
01:06:42.958 --> 01:06:45.335
because it's getting ridiculous,
as far as I'm concerned.


882
01:06:45.419 --> 01:06:49.256
So just start pushing
and start pushing as hard as possible.


883
01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:57.180
Cohn taught Trump how to ingratiate yourself
with powerful people


884
01:06:57.264 --> 01:07:00.309
and how to manipulate
them for your own ends.

885
01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:16.617
<i>Roy, just hold on here.</i>

886
01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:19.995
You have to make a very special wish.

887
01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:31.840
It was like this funny game he played
that he could bring someone like me,


888
01:07:31.924 --> 01:07:38.680
you know, to these total antigay
Republican stronghold of a party, you know?


889
01:07:38.764 --> 01:07:41.016
And no one would say a word.

890
01:07:48.023 --> 01:07:52.069
<i>Roy Cohn's friends justified him as a friend.</i>

891
01:07:52.152 --> 01:07:55.238
<i>They knew about the McCarthy years,
the Army-McCarthy hearings,</i>


892
01:07:55.322 --> 01:07:59.451
<i>some of the dastardly things
that Roy may have done.</i>


893
01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:03.205
But that was overwhelmed
by their feeling that he was their friend,


894
01:08:03.288 --> 01:08:05.707
and genuine friend, and they cared about him.

895
01:08:05.791 --> 01:08:08.293
I've tried to give loyalty,

896
01:08:08.377 --> 01:08:10.754
and I've tried to give
friendship, and I find in life,

897
01:08:10.837 --> 01:08:14.841
when you extend friendship
and you extend loyalty, you get it back.


898
01:08:19.179 --> 01:08:22.015
<i>He was the one
who threw the great parties,</i>

899
01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:24.725
<i>who knew Norman Mailer,
who hung out with Andy Warhol.</i>


900
01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:28.272
All these people who were larger-than-life people,
they were orbiting Roy.


901
01:08:32.484 --> 01:08:34.443
<i>Everybody came, mayors,</i>

902
01:08:34.528 --> 01:08:39.323
governors, police chiefs, firemen,
anybody from the newspaper.


903
01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:42.995
Who didn't go?

904
01:08:43.077 --> 01:08:45.372
<i>And Cardinal Spellman would come.</i>

905
01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:47.666
Real-estate magnates would come.

906
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:49.334
<i>Trump would go.</i>

907
01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:53.171
<i>And there he would see
the leading politicians of New York City</i>


908
01:08:53.255 --> 01:08:56.049
<i>who would be very helpful to him
in his business.</i>


909
01:09:00.095 --> 01:09:01.972
<i>He navigates this world</i>

910
01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:06.768
<i>between the people who hang out
at Sardi's and the 21 Club,</i>


911
01:09:06.852 --> 01:09:09.438
<i>and this other world that has these mobsters,</i>

912
01:09:09.521 --> 01:09:11.398
and it creates a sort of glamour.

913
01:09:13.358 --> 01:09:15.611
<i>So Cohn is this bridge</i>

914
01:09:15.693 --> 01:09:19.113
<i>between the legitimate world
and the illegitimate world.</i>


915
01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:33.295
<i>Cohn was a legend in his own mind.</i>

916
01:09:33.378 --> 01:09:35.714
<i>If you approach things that way,</i>

917
01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:38.966
pretty soon,
the appearance contributes to the reality.


918
01:10:01.365 --> 01:10:05.702
Everyone knows the most famous legal eagle,
my pal and yours, Roy Cohn.


919
01:10:05.786 --> 01:10:08.747
-Good evening, Nikki. How are you?
-I'm fine. How are you?


920
01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:13.460
Well, this is a very exciting occasion.
Here is Trump Tower.


921
01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:17.506
Marble waterfalls,
the greatest stores in the world.


922
01:10:17.589 --> 01:10:21.009
When something like this
can be created in New York


923
01:10:21.093 --> 01:10:24.805
and take the city by
storm, it's a real event.

924
01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:36.233
Donald Trump wanted to construct a building,

925
01:10:36.316 --> 01:10:39.820
which is now known as Trump Tower,
at Fifth Avenue


926
01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:43.156
between 56th and 57th Street.

927
01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:46.493
<i>He got ahold of the Bonwit Teller
department store,</i>


928
01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:48.412
<i>this prime piece of real estate.</i>

929
01:10:49.871 --> 01:10:52.291
<i>Donald hires, to tear down the building,</i>

930
01:10:52.374 --> 01:10:57.713
a Syracuse window-washing firm
with no experience whatsoever.


931
01:10:57.796 --> 01:11:03.093
<i>And it uses 200 illegal immigrants from Poland.</i>

932
01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.056
And then they don't get paid.

933
01:11:11.351 --> 01:11:16.773
<i>Buildings of that sort at the time
were made largely with structural steel,</i>


934
01:11:16.857 --> 01:11:21.403
because to make them out of concrete
was quite costly


935
01:11:21.486 --> 01:11:23.447
and also involved dealing with the Mob,

936
01:11:23.530 --> 01:11:28.619
which controlled the poured-contract industry
in New York.


937
01:11:28.702 --> 01:11:33.582
<i>Strangely, Trump chose
to make it out of concrete.</i>


938
01:11:33.665 --> 01:11:35.167
Now, why out of concrete?

939
01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:40.297
Because Cohn introduced him
to his Mafioso clients,


940
01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:43.050
<i>and it was through them
that he was able to make the deal.</i>


941
01:11:44.259 --> 01:11:46.303
Everything about this project was corrupt.

942
01:11:57.689 --> 01:12:02.444
<i>Donald Trump is probably
one of the most important names in America today.</i>


943
01:12:02.527 --> 01:12:08.784
What started off as a meteor
mounting from New York and going upward


944
01:12:08.867 --> 01:12:11.870
is gonna touch the rest of this country
and parts...


945
01:12:11.954 --> 01:12:13.246
Good parts of the world.

946
01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:16.208
Donald just wants to be
the biggest winner of all.

947
01:12:18.335 --> 01:12:19.670
<i>Donald had the money,</i>

948
01:12:19.753 --> 01:12:23.131
<i>and Roy had the balls and the shrewdness,</i>

949
01:12:23.215 --> 01:12:24.633
and also some of the connections

950
01:12:24.716 --> 01:12:31.306
to move Trump beyond the world
of housing developments in Queens and Brooklyn.


951
01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:34.393
And it was clearly mutually beneficial.

952
01:12:35.394 --> 01:12:36.561
Let me tell you about this.

953
01:12:36.645 --> 01:12:38.855
This is a picture of Donald and me,

954
01:12:38.939 --> 01:12:42.734
in which he says,
"Roy is my greatest friend."


955
01:12:42.818 --> 01:12:44.319
And then there's a letter from him.

956
01:12:44.403 --> 01:12:48.031
<i>He says, "Needless to say,
your representation of me</i>


957
01:12:48.115 --> 01:12:50.993
<i>with regard to the Trump Tower case
was brilliant.</i>


958
01:12:51.076 --> 01:12:52.953
Everyone scoffed at our pursuit

959
01:12:53.036 --> 01:12:55.747
of this difficult victory,
saying it couldn't be done."


960
01:12:55.831 --> 01:12:59.543
Now, here's a typical Donald Trump.
He's gotta come in with a crack at the end.


961
01:12:59.626 --> 01:13:02.963
He says, "The skeptics,
however, were at a disadvantage.


962
01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:07.968
They never saw Roy Cohn in action,
especially when he really wants to win."


963
01:13:09.094 --> 01:13:11.179
By the way, this
picture hangs in my office

964
01:13:11.263 --> 01:13:16.018
directly next to a picture I treasure
of the president and Mrs. Reagan.


965
01:13:16.101 --> 01:13:17.102
Two of my favorites.

966
01:13:21.565 --> 01:13:25.027
Roy was responsible, according to Roy,

967
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:28.363
for everything important
that happened in the United States,


968
01:13:28.447 --> 01:13:30.866
whether it's an election of a governor,

969
01:13:30.949 --> 01:13:32.576
<i>an election of a president.</i>

970
01:13:33.994 --> 01:13:35.495
<i>If you had been attorney general</i>

971
01:13:35.579 --> 01:13:38.582
<i>when Richard Nixon was in office
during the Watergate times,</i>


972
01:13:38.665 --> 01:13:40.834
do you think you could have solved
that problem?


973
01:13:40.918 --> 01:13:43.629
I think Nixon could have solved
the problem, Tom.


974
01:13:43.712 --> 01:13:45.255
Or counseled him on how to solve it.

975
01:13:45.339 --> 01:13:50.594
I think the problem could have been solved
very easily by getting rid of the tapes.


976
01:13:50.677 --> 01:13:54.806
Roy Cohn's reach in American politics
is absolutely extraordinary.


977
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:56.808
<i>He's got Richard Nixon as a connection</i>

978
01:13:56.892 --> 01:14:01.229
<i>because Nixon's rise
depended on the whole anti-Communist fervor.</i>


979
01:14:02.564 --> 01:14:04.066
Has connections to Ronald Reagan,

980
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:09.404
<i>who cooperated with the McCarthy-type
investigations in the early 50's.</i>


981
01:14:09.488 --> 01:14:13.325
Cohn became an important figure
in Republican politics.


982
01:14:14.368 --> 01:14:19.414
<i>He was a registered Democrat,
yet he most closely identified with the political right.</i>


983
01:14:21.667 --> 01:14:24.378
<i>In 1980, Reagan won the election</i>

984
01:14:24.461 --> 01:14:29.508
because Roy Cohn arranged
for John Anderson,


985
01:14:29.591 --> 01:14:33.720
<i>who had challenged Reagan
for the Republican nomination,</i>


986
01:14:33.804 --> 01:14:35.889
<i>to be the liberal party nominee.</i>

987
01:14:38.225 --> 01:14:40.852
There's a three-way split in New York.

988
01:14:40.936 --> 01:14:44.147
That three-way split
allows Reagan to win the electoral votes


989
01:14:44.231 --> 01:14:46.441
with 45 percent of the vote.

990
01:14:50.362 --> 01:14:52.030
It was a setup, and it worked.

991
01:14:53.073 --> 01:14:55.993
<i>I was present in his office
when Nancy Reagan called him</i>


992
01:14:56.076 --> 01:14:59.788
and thanked him
for getting her husband elected.


993
01:15:02.416 --> 01:15:06.378
John Anderson wasn't the only political fix
Roy was responsible for.


994
01:15:06.461 --> 01:15:10.549
He also torpedoed the vice-presidential
campaigns of Eagleton in '72...


995
01:15:12.843 --> 01:15:14.636
<i>and Ferraro in '84.</i>

996
01:15:16.305 --> 01:15:20.934
Roy was the one who made the link
between organized crime and her husband.


997
01:15:21.018 --> 01:15:25.147
The <i>New York Post</i>and the Daily News,
as you might imagine, went to town.


998
01:15:27.983 --> 01:15:32.487
Cohn saw himself as a political puppeteer.

999
01:15:33.572 --> 01:15:35.407
<i>He started an evolution.</i>

1000
01:15:36.617 --> 01:15:39.661
<i>This would certainly be the beginning</i>

1001
01:15:39.745 --> 01:15:44.041
<i>of the infiltration of the political-right media</i>

1002
01:15:44.124 --> 01:15:46.627
<i>into American government.</i>

1003
01:15:48.754 --> 01:15:51.214
<i>Rupert Murdoch
and the</i>New York Post<i>endorsement</i>


1004
01:15:51.298 --> 01:15:56.720
is something that Roy Cohn
works on every day for eight months,


1005
01:15:56.803 --> 01:16:01.767
mostly by giving Rupert Murdoch himself
a window into Reagan's campaign.


1006
01:16:05.395 --> 01:16:10.776
<i>It's not surprising that he could be
with Ronald Reagan and Rupert Murdoch,</i>


1007
01:16:10.859 --> 01:16:14.696
<i>who developed Fox News, in the Oval Office,</i>

1008
01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:17.866
<i>as though he engineered the entire relationship.</i>

1009
01:16:21.119 --> 01:16:24.581
<i>You can see what Cohn set into motion,</i>

1010
01:16:25.666 --> 01:16:30.587
winding up with the type of political environment
we have today.


1011
01:16:38.762 --> 01:16:41.932
<i>I can't think of anything else like him
in American history or anywhere.</i>


1012
01:16:42.015 --> 01:16:46.228
People should have ignored him
and put him in jail.


1013
01:16:46.311 --> 01:16:50.941
And here he is flying around in his own plane
to go have dinner at the White House.


1014
01:16:51.024 --> 01:16:52.276
Go figure that out.

1015
01:16:55.279 --> 01:17:00.075
I think the Reagan anticrime program
is gonna take the emphasis off


1016
01:17:00.158 --> 01:17:03.245
certain types of white-collar crimes,
minor things...


1017
01:17:03.328 --> 01:17:04.204
That's good for you.

1018
01:17:04.288 --> 01:17:05.539
Minor things and all that,

1019
01:17:05.622 --> 01:17:09.418
and put it on where the
real root of the problem is,

1020
01:17:09.501 --> 01:17:12.379
violent crimes,
so that the people of this country


1021
01:17:12.462 --> 01:17:14.715
are once again in control
instead of the criminals.


1022
01:17:14.798 --> 01:17:16.758
-Are you running for any office?
-No.


1023
01:17:16.842 --> 01:17:18.844
Have you been called
by the government of France


1024
01:17:18.927 --> 01:17:21.263
to restore the guillotine
and conduct a campaign there?


1025
01:17:21.346 --> 01:17:26.435
No, but I'll tell you, I'd like to restore
capital punishment in the United States


1026
01:17:26.518 --> 01:17:29.146
so that when people
are gonna kill a policeman

1027
01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:33.025
or people are gonna mug and kill an old person,
they're gonna think twice.


1028
01:17:36.111 --> 01:17:38.864
He did whatever he wanted.

1029
01:17:38.947 --> 01:17:43.076
And he felt he was good enough
at everything to get away with it,


1030
01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.996
and he did for
a very, very long time.

1031
01:17:46.079 --> 01:17:48.749
Roy Cohn has managed to stay out of jail
all these years,


1032
01:17:48.832 --> 01:17:51.627
and I admire him for that,
and I'd like to have him for my lawyer.


1033
01:17:54.087 --> 01:17:59.384
Roy famously argued that all of the expenses
of his law firm were...


1034
01:17:59.468 --> 01:18:01.720
You know, were deductible.

1035
01:18:01.803 --> 01:18:04.056
The IRS did not see it this way.

1036
01:18:04.139 --> 01:18:08.393
Roy told me that the whole point
of dealing with the IRS


1037
01:18:08.477 --> 01:18:12.522
was to die owing them
as much as humanly possible.


1038
01:18:13.357 --> 01:18:16.485
The United States government filed a lawsuit
against Roy Cohn


1039
01:18:16.568 --> 01:18:20.572
for failing to pay nearly
$7 million in back taxes.

1040
01:18:20.656 --> 01:18:22.115
<i>You are a tax avoider.</i>

1041
01:18:22.199 --> 01:18:25.452
No, I'm not. I'm a tax avoider?
We're all tax avoiders.


1042
01:18:25.535 --> 01:18:29.539
-The president's a tax avoider. Everybody's...
-You're more successful at it than some of us.


1043
01:18:29.623 --> 01:18:31.458
Don't blame me for your inadequacy.

1044
01:18:32.918 --> 01:18:36.046
Here was a guy
who was so evidently crooked,

1045
01:18:36.129 --> 01:18:38.632
he was so evidently dishonest,

1046
01:18:38.715 --> 01:18:41.176
<i>yet nobody was doing anything about it.</i>

1047
01:18:43.387 --> 01:18:46.056
<i>There were serious disciplinary complaints,</i>

1048
01:18:46.139 --> 01:18:51.061
and they were sitting at the bottom
of the desk drawer for years.


1049
01:18:53.438 --> 01:18:55.315
<i>Last question today.</i>

1050
01:18:55.399 --> 01:18:59.194
<i>A fair number of people say
Roy Cohn is amoral.</i>


1051
01:18:59.278 --> 01:19:03.448
<i>He will use anything to
win, do anything to win.</i>

1052
01:19:03.532 --> 01:19:06.952
<i>Employ any trick, any subterfuge, etcetera.</i>

1053
01:19:07.035 --> 01:19:11.373
<i>I'd say that has to come, probably,
from people who have lost to me.</i>


1054
01:19:11.456 --> 01:19:13.000
<i>-Because I...
-But here...</i>


1055
01:19:13.083 --> 01:19:15.460
<i>-No, wait a minute. Let's stop right there.
-Yeah, sure.</i>


1056
01:19:17.462 --> 01:19:20.966
He was eventually disbarred
for stealing from his own clients


1057
01:19:21.049 --> 01:19:23.093
and trying to defraud his own clients.

1058
01:19:33.186 --> 01:19:38.191
Ultimately, we disbarred him
on the basis of four cases.


1059
01:19:38.275 --> 01:19:42.654
<i>SEC brings a case
against the Pied Piper yacht company.</i>


1060
01:19:42.738 --> 01:19:47.534
Almost all the money from the company
has managed not to go to the creditors,


1061
01:19:47.618 --> 01:19:50.579
but they've gone to
Roy Cohn and his partners.

1062
01:19:50.662 --> 01:19:54.875
<i>Second, he stole from his client
by promising to pay her back</i>


1063
01:19:54.958 --> 01:19:58.962
<i>when he had no intention of paying her back,
and then lying about it.</i>


1064
01:19:59.046 --> 01:20:02.966
And third, he tried to deceive a dying,
incompetent man


1065
01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:06.678
to making him the executor of his will.

1066
01:20:08.305 --> 01:20:12.601
<i>One of Roy Cohn's major clients
was Schenley,</i>


1067
01:20:12.684 --> 01:20:16.855
<i>a distributor of liquors and wines.</i>

1068
01:20:23.028 --> 01:20:26.657
And Lew Rosenstiel, its chairman,
was a personal friend of Roy's.


1069
01:20:27.658 --> 01:20:30.452
<i>Among the charges brought against Roy</i>

1070
01:20:30.535 --> 01:20:35.582
<i>were the fact that he had documents
executed in a hospital room</i>


1071
01:20:35.666 --> 01:20:40.420
when Mr. Rosenstiel was not capable
of knowing what he was doing.


1072
01:20:46.593 --> 01:20:50.222
My dad had a stroke,
and he was in a hospital in Miami.


1073
01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:55.686
These two people appeared at the hospital...

1074
01:20:57.145 --> 01:21:01.692
<i>one of whom was wheeling the bed around
and fixing the covers.</i>


1075
01:21:04.653 --> 01:21:08.657
It was then made clear to
me that it was Roy Cohn,

1076
01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:12.244
and that Roy was having my father
sign some papers


1077
01:21:12.327 --> 01:21:15.747
awarding himself as trustee
of my father's estate.


1078
01:21:15.831 --> 01:21:19.501
<i>The squibbly and scrawling signature
at the bottom of the last will and testament</i>


1079
01:21:19.585 --> 01:21:21.461
<i>of multimillionaire Lewis Rosenstiel</i>

1080
01:21:21.545 --> 01:21:24.756
<i>purports to be
that of the late Miami philanthropist,</i>


1081
01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.174
<i>designating attorney Roy Cohn,</i>

1082
01:21:26.258 --> 01:21:28.260
<i>Rosenstiel's granddaughter Kathy Finkelstein,</i>

1083
01:21:28.343 --> 01:21:31.513
<i>and her husband James
as trustees of a $50 million estate.</i>


1084
01:21:31.597 --> 01:21:35.892
<i>Other members of the Rosenstiel family
are contesting the will's authenticity.</i>


1085
01:21:35.976 --> 01:21:37.644
His signature was illegible.

1086
01:21:37.728 --> 01:21:42.065
Scrolly sort of X,
and a little wandering down off the line.


1087
01:21:43.108 --> 01:21:49.031
There's no image on that line
that looks anything like any letter of the alphabet.


1088
01:21:49.114 --> 01:21:51.283
<i>I mean, it was ridiculous.</i>

1089
01:21:53.076 --> 01:21:57.331
<i>You were cited as dressing up as a male nurse
and getting a fraudulent codicil signed to the will.</i>


1090
01:21:57.414 --> 01:22:01.627
-What's interested in it-- What's more interest--
<i>-What I thought was amazing was the judge said--</i>


1091
01:22:01.710 --> 01:22:05.339
Hey, mister, what's more interesting,

1092
01:22:05.422 --> 01:22:08.342
interesting to me, is how somebody like you,

1093
01:22:08.425 --> 01:22:11.094
who's aspiring
to be one of the leaders of the future,


1094
01:22:11.178 --> 01:22:13.388
could have your facts so screwed up.

1095
01:22:13.472 --> 01:22:16.433
There was no-
- Never any insinuation

1096
01:22:16.516 --> 01:22:20.729
that I could have dressed up as a male nurse
or anything like that.


1097
01:22:20.812 --> 01:22:25.817
And the charge you are referring to was thrown out
by the Bar Association in New York.


1098
01:22:25.901 --> 01:22:27.819
<i>Why'd you appeal the case, Mr. Cohn?</i>

1099
01:22:27.903 --> 01:22:30.030
Why do I have
to appeal when I win?

1100
01:22:30.113 --> 01:22:33.158
<i>
-Did you win, Mr. Cohn? 
I thought you lost.</i>
-Yes, well, maybe you...

1101
01:22:33.241 --> 01:22:35.702
<i>You would've been disbarred
as a member of the Florida Bar.</i>


1102
01:22:35.786 --> 01:22:36.620
Oh, jeez.

1103
01:22:37.871 --> 01:22:39.498
<i>He was a liar.</i>

1104
01:22:39.581 --> 01:22:42.376
<i>There are a year and
a half worth of hearings</i>

1105
01:22:42.459 --> 01:22:46.463
in which he challenges everything
and tells the same lies all over again.


1106
01:22:46.546 --> 01:22:48.090
He makes the matter worse

1107
01:22:48.173 --> 01:22:53.720
<i>and makes an application to the D.C. Bar
where he lied under oath.</i>


1108
01:22:53.804 --> 01:22:56.723
He tells lies about the Rosenstiel codicil.

1109
01:22:56.807 --> 01:22:59.559
He tells lies about the Schlesinger.

1110
01:22:59.643 --> 01:23:02.562
He just tells the same lies
over and over and over again.


1111
01:23:04.064 --> 01:23:07.567
<i>If you see a
pattern there, you're not foolish.</i>

1112
01:23:08.819 --> 01:23:11.029
And if you have no conscience about--

1113
01:23:11.113 --> 01:23:16.702
Or shame about whether
you're telling an untruth or you're using hyperbole,


1114
01:23:16.785 --> 01:23:17.869
you get away with it.

1115
01:23:19.246 --> 01:23:21.415
<i>When he was about to be disbarred,</i>

1116
01:23:21.498 --> 01:23:25.669
it was no surprise
who shows up as character witnesses


1117
01:23:25.752 --> 01:23:26.962
for Roy Cohn,

1118
01:23:27.045 --> 01:23:28.589
<i>but Barbara Walters...</i>

1119
01:23:29.923 --> 01:23:32.467
<i>William F. Buckley Jr.,</i>

1120
01:23:32.551 --> 01:23:33.844
<i>Donald Trump.</i>

1121
01:23:35.095 --> 01:23:41.018
The same people who he had cultivated
and who, in effect, had used him over decades.


1122
01:23:43.353 --> 01:23:47.149
<i>Thirty-seven witnesses testified.</i>

1123
01:23:47.232 --> 01:23:50.152
<i>You know what they all said under oath?</i>

1124
01:23:50.235 --> 01:23:56.700
"Roy Cohn has an excellent reputation
in the community for integrity."


1125
01:23:56.783 --> 01:24:00.746
And they said that with a straight face
after taking an oath?


1126
01:24:00.829 --> 01:24:02.831
Man, that's power.

1127
01:24:02.915 --> 01:24:05.584
Here's what the Disciplinary Committee
of the Bar says about you.


1128
01:24:05.667 --> 01:24:10.422
Quote, "A total absence of moral character
and professional fitness.


1129
01:24:10.505 --> 01:24:13.091
A cruel public use of your illness.

1130
01:24:14.509 --> 01:24:18.764
<i>Pleading for clemency for a dying lawyer
and showing up in court the next day."</i>


1131
01:24:18.847 --> 01:24:23.226
They couldn't say it about me, because I never
cited my illness as a reason for anything.


1132
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:28.023
Anyone who knows me knows I don't plead,
and I'm not pleading in this case.


1133
01:24:28.106 --> 01:24:31.401
I don't like any of them.
I've called them a bunch of yoyos.


1134
01:24:31.485 --> 01:24:32.986
And there might be other lawyers

1135
01:24:33.070 --> 01:24:36.198
who have a guilty conscience
or feel they have to crawl.


1136
01:24:36.281 --> 01:24:37.950
But I don't have a guilty conscience,

1137
01:24:38.033 --> 01:24:41.411
and I'm not gonna crawl before this committee
or any committee like it.


1138
01:24:41.495 --> 01:24:43.246
He wouldn't plead to anything.

1139
01:24:43.330 --> 01:24:47.751
Roy Cohn went out and hired excellent lawyers.

1140
01:24:47.834 --> 01:24:51.463
<i>But we had him. 
He wasn't getting out of this.</i>

1141
01:24:54.675 --> 01:24:56.760
He was a pinned moth.

1142
01:25:03.558 --> 01:25:07.938
Roy gave a private dinner for his closest friends
and relatives every year.


1143
01:25:09.648 --> 01:25:15.654
<i>And the one I was invited to
took place after he had been disbarred.</i>


1144
01:25:15.737 --> 01:25:21.243
<i>And when I got there,
this long table was set, and nobody came.</i>


1145
01:25:23.912 --> 01:25:29.334
He had a lot of friends until he was disbarred,
and then he had no friends. They all ran away.


1146
01:25:33.422 --> 01:25:37.467
<i>I wanna know why he's objecting
to the way people are treating him now.</i>


1147
01:25:38.552 --> 01:25:41.972
<i>Why don't he remember what he did,
not only with McCarthy,</i>


1148
01:25:42.055 --> 01:25:48.604
<i>but with Fifth Avenue bus lines, Lionel Trains,
and is he proud of his record as an attorney?</i>


1149
01:25:48.687 --> 01:25:49.646
<i>I'll hang up.</i>

1150
01:25:49.730 --> 01:25:52.190
-Okay.
-Okay, the answer is yes.


1151
01:25:52.274 --> 01:25:53.650
I am proud of my record.

1152
01:25:53.734 --> 01:25:57.529
When you would try to get him
to talk about Joe McCarthy


1153
01:25:57.613 --> 01:26:02.034
or the Army-McCarthy trials
or that whole period,


1154
01:26:02.117 --> 01:26:06.288
J. Edgar Hoover,
you couldn't get much out of him.


1155
01:26:06.371 --> 01:26:10.542
On the Rosenbergs,
I asked him how he felt about it.


1156
01:26:10.626 --> 01:26:13.962
I told him I'd read the case,
and he said, and I quote,


1157
01:26:14.046 --> 01:26:19.051
"If I could've pulled the switch,
I'd have done it myself."


1158
01:26:19.134 --> 01:26:21.970
That doesn't sound like remorse.

1159
01:26:22.054 --> 01:26:24.932
I think Roy was
a hardliner to the end.

1160
01:26:25.015 --> 01:26:26.224
You feel pretty good.

1161
01:26:26.308 --> 01:26:28.518
-I feel great.
-Why?


1162
01:26:28.602 --> 01:26:32.397
I mean, you were at death's door,
six months ago, three months ago?


1163
01:26:32.481 --> 01:26:36.360
They found I had liver cancer
and they found that...


1164
01:26:36.443 --> 01:26:41.406
Which spreads in strange directions.

1165
01:26:41.490 --> 01:26:44.785
-Tell me... I'm in total remission.
-Are you in remission?


1166
01:26:44.868 --> 01:26:48.997
When I talk to friends and tell them
that I am doing a profile of Roy Cohn,


1167
01:26:49.081 --> 01:26:51.458
they say, "Ask him this, please."

1168
01:26:51.541 --> 01:26:55.212
And I'm sure you know
what they tell me to ask you.


1169
01:26:55.295 --> 01:26:57.673
-Do you have AIDS?
-Oh, no.


1170
01:26:58.882 --> 01:27:00.217
That's easy to answer.

1171
01:27:04.179 --> 01:27:07.766
<i>Peter Fraser, his companion,
helped him everywhere.</i>


1172
01:27:07.849 --> 01:27:11.687
Roy was forgetting things left and right,
which never had happened before.


1173
01:27:11.770 --> 01:27:16.692
And he looked at me with these pale blue eyes
and these hooded kind of eyes,


1174
01:27:16.775 --> 01:27:18.902
and quivering, and he said--

1175
01:27:18.986 --> 01:27:20.612
I said, "They say you have AIDS."

1176
01:27:20.696 --> 01:27:23.699
And he said,
"Who is they, and what do they know about me?"


1177
01:27:26.576 --> 01:27:31.164
Even at the end,
he refused to admit that he was gay,


1178
01:27:31.248 --> 01:27:33.500
and he refused to
admit that he had AIDS.

1179
01:27:33.584 --> 01:27:37.963
It was almost hard for me to believe
because of the man I had grown to know.


1180
01:27:38.964 --> 01:27:41.717
<i>It was a mistake for Roy
to deny that he had AIDS.</i>


1181
01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:44.469
It was a mistake to deny
that he was a homosexual.


1182
01:27:44.553 --> 01:27:47.681
If he had come out and said,
"Look, I'm homosexual. I have AIDS.


1183
01:27:47.764 --> 01:27:50.475
We need to do something,
not just for me, but for the community,"


1184
01:27:50.559 --> 01:27:51.685
he would have been a hero.

1185
01:27:51.768 --> 01:27:54.229
Instead, he was a hypocrite.

1186
01:27:56.148 --> 01:28:01.069
<i>And at the same time, he took advantage
of his connections to get special treatment.</i>


1187
01:28:05.115 --> 01:28:08.952
The Reagan White House actually got him
into the National Institutes of Health


1188
01:28:09.036 --> 01:28:12.372
to do an experimental treatment
that nobody could get into.


1189
01:28:12.456 --> 01:28:15.542
So here was President Reagan
and all the people around him


1190
01:28:15.626 --> 01:28:18.170
<i>basically denying there was an AIDS epidemic,</i>

1191
01:28:18.253 --> 01:28:19.922
<i>and yet Roy was flying down there</i>

1192
01:28:20.005 --> 01:28:23.300
<i>and going there a lot
for this experimental treatment.</i>


1193
01:28:23.383 --> 01:28:28.555
<i>And he acted like he
was there on a mistake.</i>

1194
01:28:28.639 --> 01:28:31.350
He didn't really have AIDS.

1195
01:28:31.433 --> 01:28:35.604
You know, he never gave
up on his own myth.

1196
01:28:35.687 --> 01:28:39.149
Are you gonna win this one too?

1197
01:28:39.232 --> 01:28:41.026
<i>You're darn right I am, Larry.</i>

1198
01:28:41.109 --> 01:28:42.402
Thanks for being with us, Roy.

1199
01:28:42.486 --> 01:28:46.823
<i>I enjoyed it, and I hope not so much time goes
until I'm with you again.</i>


1200
01:29:02.756 --> 01:29:05.384
Roy was incredibly loyal to friends.

1201
01:29:07.094 --> 01:29:09.638
<i>And he was intensely loyal to Donald Trump.</i>

1202
01:29:13.809 --> 01:29:17.187
<i>Trump took his legal business to somebody else
when Roy had AIDS.</i>


1203
01:29:17.271 --> 01:29:21.775
He stopped seeing Roy and calling Roy
and hanging out with Roy.


1204
01:29:23.318 --> 01:29:25.946
You know, of course, why people ask
about AIDS and Roy Cohn?


1205
01:29:26.029 --> 01:29:29.241
-Sure. Of course. Of course.
-Because they believe that you're a homosexual.


1206
01:29:29.324 --> 01:29:32.160
And that you simply have never
acknowledged the fact.


1207
01:29:32.244 --> 01:29:35.831
And a good friend of mine,
and a good friend of yours, I should say...


1208
01:29:35.914 --> 01:29:38.792
Tell him, if he wants to admit anything,
he can, but it's a lie.


1209
01:29:38.875 --> 01:29:41.962
No, a good friend of
mine who is a woman

1210
01:29:42.045 --> 01:29:48.760
says that she believes that Roy Cohn
wants to, in effect, come out of the closet.


1211
01:29:50.262 --> 01:29:54.349
"Come out of the closet" meaning,
make a very dramatic statement about...


1212
01:29:54.433 --> 01:29:57.811
Yeah, just acknowledge it.
There's certainly nothing horrible about it.


1213
01:29:57.894 --> 01:30:04.526
Mike, we've been here, we've been doing
a very intensive 20 minutes or more on me.


1214
01:30:06.278 --> 01:30:07.404
I think you can see me.

1215
01:30:07.487 --> 01:30:14.036
I think you can see, and the audience can,
I ain't dying from nothing, to start with, number one.


1216
01:30:14.119 --> 01:30:16.413
-Right. Right.
-Number two, you asked me categorically.


1217
01:30:16.496 --> 01:30:20.542
And I tell you categorically, 
I do not have AIDS.

1218
01:30:20.626 --> 01:30:23.211
-Where do all these stories come from?
-It's a cinch, Mike.


1219
01:30:23.295 --> 01:30:25.505
Take this set of facts.

1220
01:30:25.589 --> 01:30:30.135
Bachelor, unmarried, middle-aged.

1221
01:30:30.218 --> 01:30:33.639
Well, young middle-aged, and...

1222
01:30:35.307 --> 01:30:38.977
Then all the stories go back
to the McCarthy/Schine days.


1223
01:30:40.103 --> 01:30:42.564
<i>Schine was a bachelor too.</i>

1224
01:30:42.648 --> 01:30:44.733
<i>-We were both bachelors.
-So was McCarthy.</i>


1225
01:30:44.816 --> 01:30:46.151
<i>Right, and so was McCarthy.</i>

1226
01:30:49.655 --> 01:30:55.118
<i>At that point, his phone calls are erratic.</i>

1227
01:30:55.202 --> 01:30:56.954
<i>They don't make much sense.</i>

1228
01:30:57.037 --> 01:30:59.873
<i>He tires very, very easily.</i>

1229
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.335
<i>I called the hospital.</i>

1230
01:31:03.418 --> 01:31:07.881
<i>I asked for his room,
and Tom Bolan answered the phone.</i>


1231
01:31:08.632 --> 01:31:12.886
And I said, "Tom, 
I wanna see Roy."

1232
01:31:12.970 --> 01:31:16.723
And Tom said, "Don't come. 
It's too late.

1233
01:31:16.807 --> 01:31:19.559
He won't recognize you." He said he's...

1234
01:31:19.643 --> 01:31:24.606
And then I realized
I had missed my chance to say goodbye.


1235
01:31:26.191 --> 01:31:30.904
<i>If you had a
chance to write your epitaph...</i>

1236
01:31:31.655 --> 01:31:33.824
how would you like to be remembered?

1237
01:31:33.907 --> 01:31:36.702
I guess I would like to be remembered most...
Look, I...


1238
01:31:36.785 --> 01:31:39.246
We know what my epitaph is gonna be
in all the papers.


1239
01:31:39.329 --> 01:31:40.497
What's it gonna be?

1240
01:31:40.581 --> 01:31:46.211
It's gonna be
"Roy Cohn dies, was McCarthy chief aide."


1241
01:31:46.295 --> 01:31:49.673
No matter what I do, good or bad,
for the rest of the years of my life,


1242
01:31:49.756 --> 01:31:51.300
that's what it's going to be.

1243
01:32:14.406 --> 01:32:18.660
My mother told me that she found a list
of Roy's career path.


1244
01:32:18.744 --> 01:32:23.749
<i>It started out as prosecutor,
which he was right out of law school.</i>


1245
01:32:23.832 --> 01:32:29.421
<i>And then a series of political positions,
ending up with governor of New York.</i>


1246
01:32:32.049 --> 01:32:35.427
<i>He never reached
the kind of public-policy power</i>


1247
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:38.388
<i>that he had envisioned himself as having.</i>

1248
01:32:38.472 --> 01:32:43.060
<i>But it's undeniable
that his impact on politics lives on.</i>


1249
01:32:47.773 --> 01:32:50.901
<i>Roy was an evil...</i>

1250
01:32:50.984 --> 01:32:54.488
<i>produced by certain parts
of the American culture.</i>


1251
01:32:57.199 --> 01:33:03.455
<i>There always is the possibility of another person
who cares not about our traditions</i>


1252
01:33:03.538 --> 01:33:05.791
<i>or our laws or our protections</i>

1253
01:33:05.874 --> 01:33:07.668
who can come in and wreck it,

1254
01:33:07.751 --> 01:33:11.338
and wreck it for the weakest among us
and the most vulnerable.


1255
01:33:18.845 --> 01:33:24.017
<i>Power in the hands of someone
who is that reckless</i>


1256
01:33:24.101 --> 01:33:28.522
<i>and that arrogant is a very dangerous thing.</i>
