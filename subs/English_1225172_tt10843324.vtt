00:00:18.376 --> 00:00:22.043
(baseball thudding lightly)

3
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.847
(car horn honking)

4
00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:11.191
Yes!

5
00:01:13.392 --> 00:01:15.474
(moving orchestral music)

6
00:01:15.516 --> 00:01:18.864

(anxious orchestral music)

10
00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:47.235
Where do you think you're going?

11
00:01:47.277 --> 00:01:48.610
Stealing home.

12
00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.326
(anxious music)

13
00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:56.611

(players and crowd shouting)

18
00:02:19.992 --> 00:02:24.992
[Manager] Mitch. (voice echoing)

19
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.224
Mitch. (voice echoing)

20
00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:30.011
Jennings!

21
00:02:30.053 --> 00:02:31.053
You're up!

22
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.233
Game time.

23
00:02:39.296 --> 00:02:42.916
[Announcer] Now batting, your
right fielder, number 12...


24
00:02:42.957 --> 00:02:43.749
Let's go. (clapping)

25
00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:44.582
- Mitch "Dino"...
- You got this.


26
00:02:44.624 --> 00:02:45.643
We're in the game.

27
00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:46.478
- Get in there!
- Jennings!


28
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.270
(crowd cheering)

29
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.832
Come on, Jennings. You got this.

30
00:03:23.856 --> 00:03:26.774
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

31
00:03:36.033 --> 00:03:39.200
(baseball bat whiffs)

32
00:03:55.146 --> 00:03:57.283
(baseball bat whiffs)

33
00:03:57.325 --> 00:04:00.075
(crowd cheering)

34
00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:12.984
Come on now. Don't force it.

35
00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.572
(player spits)

36
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.777
(anxious music)

37
00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.268
(baseball bat whacks)

38
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.825
(crowd cheering)

39
00:04:41.867 --> 00:04:43.367
Come on. Get up.

40
00:04:47.283 --> 00:04:48.073
(baseball thumps into glove)

41
00:04:48.116 --> 00:04:49.082
(crowd groans)

42
00:04:49.124 --> 00:04:50.374
Come on, Mitch.

43
00:04:52.665 --> 00:04:55.165
(Mitch sighs)

44
00:04:59.354 --> 00:05:01.937
(helmet thuds)

45
00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.782
(players chattering)

46
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.730
Big fly would've made him a hero.

47
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.993
Base hit would've kept us in game though!

48
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.466
You know, why don't
you give it up, man?

49
00:05:24.508 --> 00:05:26.308
Give the rest of
us a chance to win.

50
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.308
You deaf or just
hard of hearing from age?

51
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.388
Dino, right?

52
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.221
[Player] Come on, man.

53
00:05:34.263 --> 00:05:36.823
Dino. Isn't that what
they call you, old man?


54
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.010
Hey!

55
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.840
Hey!

56
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.580
I said hey!

57
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.350
I'm not done talking to you.

58
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.729
Ooh, there's a little bit of fire.

59
00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:57.540
You want some of me? Huh?

60
00:05:57.582 --> 00:05:59.015
There's the fire. 
I want all of you.

61
00:05:59.039 --> 00:05:59.830
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Just stop it.


62
00:05:59.872 --> 00:06:00.927
That's what you really want, huh?

63
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:01.742
- Huh?
- Come on!


64
00:06:01.784 --> 00:06:03.120
Come on, let him in, boys!

65
00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:04.003
- Come on!
- Let's go.


66
00:06:04.045 --> 00:06:04.836
- I will kill you!
- Let him go, boys.


67
00:06:04.878 --> 00:06:06.393
[Player] Let him go. Take it easy.

68
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:08.728
I did my best!

69
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.576
Yeah, go cry to your
wife about doing your best.


70
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.698
Hey!

71
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.396
That guy plays harder that
you and me both combined.


72
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.686
Anybody else hearing this guy?

73
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:15.688
Yeah, we hear it good and clear.

74
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:16.588
Anybody else-(ice clatters)

75
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.358
So does the pink
slip that's in my office!

76
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.278
Get in there now, Gibson,

77
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.358
if you ever wanna see
the baseball field again!


78
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400
Now!

79
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.963
Child! you're an infant!

80
00:06:27.005 --> 00:06:29.588
(Gibson spits)

81
00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:35.408
(towel smacks)

82
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.390
Jennings.

83
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.760
Hold up.

84
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.150
I mean, he was right, you know?

85
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.870
Base hit would've tied it up.

86
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.940
Home run would've won.

87
00:06:53.503 --> 00:06:54.803
They just love you here.

88
00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.340
You're my hero.

89
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.994
What do you got to prove?

90
00:07:01.036 --> 00:07:03.058
(Mitch sighs)

91
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.273
That I'm a somebody.

92
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.698
What do you mean? You're a
baseball legend in this town.


93
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.890
And that's the point.

94
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.368
All these years of giving it 110%,

95
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.528
what do I have to show for?

96
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:20.068
I mean, outside of here... (scoffs)

97
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.216
I'm a nobody.

98
00:07:21.258 --> 00:07:23.368
(somber music)

99
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.063
And I don't wanna be a nobody.

100
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.318
For God's sakes, my own father
has a stupid autographed bat


101
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.860
that's more important than me.

102
00:07:36.549 --> 00:07:38.968
All I want to be is that guy

103
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.013
who gets his check
signed by a pro team.

104
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.133
Up at the show, or even close.

105
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.760
Maybe then I'll be a somebody.

106
00:07:56.397 --> 00:07:58.980
(somber music)

107
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:01.130
Mitch?

108
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.490
How many bats you signed?

109
00:08:10.673 --> 00:08:12.110
(Mitch sighs)

110
00:08:12.152 --> 00:08:17.152
(somber music) (dog barking)

111
00:08:19.463 --> 00:08:22.463
(crickets chirping)

112
00:08:25.594 --> 00:08:30.594
(crowd cheering) (dramatic music)

113
00:08:31.651 --> 00:08:32.980
(helmet thuds)

114
00:08:33.021 --> 00:08:34.271
[Umpire] Out!

115
00:08:38.362 --> 00:08:40.168
I tried my best.

116
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:41.938
Not good enough.

117
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:42.778
Get up!

118
00:08:42.819 --> 00:08:44.520
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Have to?

119
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.923
Nobody tells me what I have to do.

120
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.538
And definitely not no woman!

121
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.326
I don't wanna go down there
and be embarrassed again!


122
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.978
Jerry, he needs his father there.

123
00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.378
Why don't you just talk to him?

124
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.583
I'll decide what our child needs.

125
00:09:01.814 --> 00:09:03.647
Matter of fact, Mitch!

126
00:09:07.592 --> 00:09:11.342
(horn honks in the distance)

127
00:09:13.396 --> 00:09:15.896
(door creaks)

128
00:09:19.378 --> 00:09:22.295
(duffel bag thuds)

129
00:09:27.487 --> 00:09:30.154
(juice sloshes)

130
00:09:47.107 --> 00:09:48.564
Evan.

131
00:09:48.606 --> 00:09:49.606
(doorknob rattles)

132
00:09:49.641 --> 00:09:50.641
Evan.

133
00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:52.992
(Mitch sighs)

134
00:09:53.034 --> 00:09:55.617
(tense music)

135
00:10:10.877 --> 00:10:14.710
(music playing on television)

136
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.213
(Mitch winces)

137
00:10:33.764 --> 00:10:36.347
(Mitch grunts)

138
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.840
(ethereal music)

139
00:11:11.155 --> 00:11:13.439
(faint thudding)

140
00:11:13.481 --> 00:11:15.229
(backpack zipping)

141
00:11:15.271 --> 00:11:16.408
Evan.

142
00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:17.241
(banging on door)

143
00:11:17.283 --> 00:11:18.549
Evan, open the door.

144
00:11:18.591 --> 00:11:19.382
(banging on door)

145
00:11:19.424 --> 00:11:20.215
Evan, open the door.

146
00:11:20.257 --> 00:11:21.748
(door opens)

147
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.440
What in God's name are you doing?

148
00:11:24.863 --> 00:11:25.654
(backpack rustling)

149
00:11:25.696 --> 00:11:26.487
I didn't do nothing!

150
00:11:26.529 --> 00:11:27.320
Stop!

151
00:11:27.362 --> 00:11:28.220
Evan!

152
00:11:28.262 --> 00:11:31.262
(backpack rustling)

153
00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.398
You deal with it this time.

154
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.348
What's your deal, Mitch?

155
00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.088
Boy, I am still your father!

156
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.008
And you are an idiot!

157
00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.050
What are you doing?

158
00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.335
I just need to go out, that's all.

159
00:11:45.377 --> 00:11:47.308
Yeah, and the last time I checked,

160
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.858
the bathroom is inside of
the house, not out the window!


161
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.448
Who cares?

162
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:52.490
Do you care?

163
00:11:53.407 --> 00:11:54.857
Because you sure never act like you do!

164
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:56.488
What are you talking about?

165
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.698
Tell me why you are trying
to sneak out of the house


166
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.588
with a backpack full of beer?

167
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:02.421
So what?

168
00:12:02.463 --> 00:12:03.328
And you're an idiot!

169
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.161
I'm an idiot?

170
00:12:04.203 --> 00:12:05.548
Yeah!

171
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.166
You are an idiot!

172
00:12:07.208 --> 00:12:09.595
You know, you're a worthless father.
You know that?


173
00:12:09.637 --> 00:12:11.368
You barely even come around here!

174
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.303
Why should I tell you anything?

175
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.140
Huh?

176
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.063
You may be my father, but
you're a worthless father!


177
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:28.147
You better not ever talk
to me like that again.


178
00:12:30.919 --> 00:12:32.252
[Child] Mommy.

179
00:12:35.059 --> 00:12:36.059
Amber...

180
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.990
Amber?

181
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.488
Come on, Amber.

182
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:51.988
Listen.

183
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.215
You need to tell me what's going on.

184
00:12:54.257 --> 00:12:56.481
What did you mean?

185
00:12:56.523 --> 00:12:57.388
What do you mean, what did I mean?

186
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.630
You said, "This time."

187
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.410
What happened before, Amber?

188
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:06.418
I just want some juice.
I thought we had some juice.


189
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.518
Yeah, you need to get some

190
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.260
the next time you go to the store.

191
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.578
Why did I not
know about whatever this is?

192
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.369
I'm his father.

193
00:13:16.411 --> 00:13:17.518
[Amber] Mm. Mm.

194
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.795
Hello?

195
00:13:18.837 --> 00:13:21.088
(Amber spits)

196
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.086
Do we seriously have nothing
to drink in this house?


197
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.348
I don't know. Why would I know that?

198
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:26.390
Huh?

199
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.090
What?

200
00:13:29.963 --> 00:13:31.378
(slams bottle)

201
00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.470
Where's my phone? 
God, what time is it?

202
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:36.475
Amber.

203
00:13:36.517 --> 00:13:37.308
(phone clicks)

204
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:38.350
That's my...

205
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.380
My phone.

206
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.180
It...

207
00:13:45.198 --> 00:13:47.698
(Mitch sighs)

208
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:51.950
Amber.

209
00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:54.928
(door slams)

210
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:55.939
Amber.

211
00:13:55.981 --> 00:13:56.874
(faucet running)

212
00:13:56.916 --> 00:13:58.923
[Amber] I have to be
at work early tomorrow.


213
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.103
Can we please just talk now?

214
00:14:10.122 --> 00:14:12.778
(Mitch sighs)

215
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:17.323
Look, I think we
need to talk about moving.

216
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.678
There's a team in Charlotte

217
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.806
that's looking for a right fielder,

218
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.188
and if there's ever a time

219
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.528
that I'm gonna make something
happen for myself, it's now.


220
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:27.020
You've gotta be kidding me.

221
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.360
Why didn't you tell me about Evan?

222
00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.520
I am still the head of this household.

223
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.078
I picked your son up
at the police station


224
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.653
last Thursday at 2:00 a.m.

225
00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.850
Smoking weed and drinking
beer with his friends at the park.


226
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.193
Now you know.

227
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.007
What do you want from me, huh?

228
00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.948
I'm out there on the
road, playing baseball,


229
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.698
fighting players, managers, owners,

230
00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.348
big league scouts for a shot.

231
00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:04.453
You know, most wives,
they would be proud of me.


232
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.550
Well, I didn't ask you
to fight for those things.


233
00:15:14.612 --> 00:15:16.828
(bar patrons chattering)

234
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.453
(upbeat music)

235
00:15:26.894 --> 00:15:29.368
I got a big scout coming
next week, Thursday.


236
00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:30.201
Really?

237
00:15:30.243 --> 00:15:32.090
Going to the show, baby.

238
00:15:32.132 --> 00:15:33.856
You mean I might have to
step up and play shortstop


239
00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.671
when you get called up?

240
00:15:34.713 --> 00:15:36.023
You may have to.

241
00:15:36.065 --> 00:15:37.265
Nice shot! Do you want more?

242
00:15:37.841 --> 00:15:39.261
- No.
- Okay.


243
00:15:39.303 --> 00:15:42.995
(empty bottles clinking)

244
00:15:43.037 --> 00:15:43.885
(indistinct chatter)

245
00:15:43.927 --> 00:15:44.977
- You see her?
- Mm.


246
00:15:46.713 --> 00:15:48.688
Hey, baby. (makes missing noises)

247
00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.953
Hey, you wanna bring us some more beers?

248
00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:55.457
I'll get there when I feel like it.

249
00:15:55.499 --> 00:15:56.733
[Doyle] Did you just call her baby?

250
00:15:56.757 --> 00:15:58.803
I did. I'll call her
a lot more than that.


251
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.440
Watch this.

252
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.419
Hey.

253
00:16:06.461 --> 00:16:08.488
Hey, so I just
wanna know, are you ready?

254
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:09.928
Ready for what?

255
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.984
Ready for me to give you
a night you'll never forget.


256
00:16:13.026 --> 00:16:13.817
(beer pouring)

257
00:16:13.859 --> 00:16:15.945
Oh! (Doyle laughing)

258
00:16:15.987 --> 00:16:16.987
Cheers.

259
00:16:18.623 --> 00:16:21.833
I think she likes me, boys. (laughs)

260
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:25.420
I gotta hit the head.

261
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.578
Hey, just come have a beer with us.

262
00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.870
We're having a good time.

263
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.143
I don't know why you
hang out with those morons.


264
00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.060
Can I get another beer, please?

265
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.088
Actually, I just got one. (chuckles)

266
00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.713
(Mitch laughs)

267
00:16:49.055 --> 00:16:52.638
Who else do I have
to hang out with, man?

268
00:16:55.314 --> 00:16:57.658
Did you hear about Gibson?

269
00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:58.700
No.

270
00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:00.786
He's got a big league
scout coming to see him


271
00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:01.933
in a few days.

272
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:04.557
[Mitch] Hm.

273
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.200
I hope they see you, too, man.

274
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.766
So when you spilled that bear on me,

275
00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.773
was that you asking
me to take you out?

276
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:14.652
Hey, come here.

277
00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.458
I don't think I should drive home.

278
00:17:17.499 --> 00:17:18.748
Hey, listen, listen.

279
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:19.677
I was only trying to hold-

280
00:17:19.719 --> 00:17:20.509
- Hey, back off!

281
00:17:20.552 --> 00:17:21.552
Whoa!

282
00:17:22.696 --> 00:17:23.584
Oh, okay.

283
00:17:23.627 --> 00:17:25.546
Why don't you get your
boyfriend to take you home


284
00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:26.570
before I hurt you?

285
00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:29.023
Doyle, let's go.

286
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.948
Hey, thanks.

287
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:33.223
I take care of myself.

288
00:17:34.155 --> 00:17:38.109
Yeah. He had it coming.

289
00:17:38.151 --> 00:17:39.151
Diya.

290
00:17:40.213 --> 00:17:41.481
Mitch.

291
00:17:41.523 --> 00:17:44.523
(upbeat rock music)

292
00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:00.001
Let's go, Doyle.

293
00:18:00.043 --> 00:18:02.710
(siren wailing)

294
00:18:04.927 --> 00:18:05.788
(Mitch sighs)

295
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.648
So what are we doing here?

296
00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.040
Why didn't I take you home?

297
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.540
I'm crashing here tonight.

298
00:18:14.402 --> 00:18:16.082
You and your wife break up or something?

299
00:18:18.854 --> 00:18:20.008
Mm.

300
00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.453
No, not exactly.

301
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.407
Can't be coming home just drunk, you know?

302
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.121
(beer sloshes)

303
00:18:30.163 --> 00:18:31.735
Come on, Doyle, man.

304
00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:35.443
Mitch, you really need a new car, man.

305
00:18:37.872 --> 00:18:40.348
Can you grab me for practice tomorrow?

306
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:41.908
All right. Whatever.

307
00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.198
Thanks.

308
00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.903
Hey, listen, Doyle.
Let me use your toilet.


309
00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:50.330
Oh, man, I'm...

310
00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:52.843
I gotta pass out.

311
00:18:53.859 --> 00:18:54.650
I'm sorry.

312
00:18:54.692 --> 00:18:56.383
Come on. It'll only take a second.

313
00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.371
Doyle!

314
00:18:58.413 --> 00:18:59.413
Use this.

315
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.400
Doyle!

316
00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.490
You could've gave me a bigger bottle.

317
00:19:10.765 --> 00:19:13.765
(door bells jangle)

318
00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:16.940
Hey!

319
00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:18.770
Hello?

320
00:19:23.448 --> 00:19:26.404
(bell dings)

321
00:19:26.446 --> 00:19:29.021
(bell dings)

322
00:19:29.063 --> 00:19:31.646
(bell dinging)

323
00:19:33.457 --> 00:19:35.040
You got a bathroom?

324
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.803
(bell dinging)

325
00:19:47.002 --> 00:19:48.982
(soft music)

326
00:19:49.024 --> 00:19:51.774
(engine putters)

327
00:19:56.402 --> 00:19:59.818
(engine putters)

328
00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.777
(engine puttering)

329
00:20:04.347 --> 00:20:07.180
(guest screaming)

330
00:20:11.129 --> 00:20:11.920
(banging on door)

331
00:20:11.962 --> 00:20:12.880
Doyle!

332
00:20:12.922 --> 00:20:13.922
You okay, man?

333
00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:15.907
Doyle!

334
00:20:15.949 --> 00:20:16.949
(banging on door)

335
00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:18.177
Alex!

336
00:20:18.219 --> 00:20:20.636
(door opens)

337
00:20:23.574 --> 00:20:26.157
(somber music)

338
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.630
You came here for...

339
00:20:49.819 --> 00:20:52.402
(somber music)

340
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:03.500
How old are you?

341
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:12.883
Can I call somebody?

342
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.293
Anybody. There's gotta be somebody, right?

343
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.893
My phone. Where's my phone?

344
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.423
No, no, don't leave, please!
Don't leave me!


345
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:32.563
He didn't pay me yet.

346
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.540
I'll get in trouble
if I don't pay them.

347
00:21:39.823 --> 00:21:42.143
What do I do? What
am I supposed to do?

348
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.010
Look.

349
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:54.223
I'll get in trouble if
I get a bad review.

350
00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:57.530
No.

351
00:21:58.457 --> 00:22:01.813
Could you please, please
just put some clothes on.


352
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.600
Thank you.

353
00:22:10.109 --> 00:22:12.692

354
00:22:21.623 --> 00:22:24.206

355
00:22:27.593 --> 00:22:30.593
(escort whimpering)

356
00:22:32.313 --> 00:22:33.313
I'm Mitch.

357
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:39.530
Samantha.

358
00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:42.050
Sammy.

359
00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.673
They call me Joy.

360
00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:52.790
I have to go.

361
00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:57.980
Thank you.

362
00:23:05.543 --> 00:23:06.651
Can you please...

363
00:23:06.693 --> 00:23:08.203
Can you please help me?

364
00:23:12.555 --> 00:23:13.555
I need help.

365
00:23:18.954 --> 00:23:21.454
(Mitch sighs)

366
00:23:24.177 --> 00:23:26.984
(emotional music)

367
00:23:27.026 --> 00:23:29.526
(door closes)

368
00:23:42.655 --> 00:23:43.756
I don't have to do nothing!

369
00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.583
Nobody tells me what I have to do!

370
00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.478
And definitely not no woman!

371
00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.036
Mitch, get out here right now!

372
00:23:51.078 --> 00:23:51.885
Get out here right now!

373
00:23:51.927 --> 00:23:53.338
[Mom] You're being unreasonable.

374
00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.688
Woman, shut up!

375
00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:56.180
Don't you interrupt me again!

376
00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.308
Mitch, boy, I know you heard me!

377
00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.141
Get out here! (banging on door)

378
00:24:00.183 --> 00:24:01.622
Jerry. (banging on door)

379
00:24:01.664 --> 00:24:03.054
Jerry!

398
00:25:29.562 --> 00:25:32.729
(baseball bat whacks)

399
00:25:37.305 --> 00:25:38.305
Mitch.

400
00:25:39.052 --> 00:25:40.052
Mitch, wait up.

401
00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:42.913
I wanna apologize, man.

402
00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:46.828
Thank you for not saying anything.

403
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:49.753
I'm really trying to work
things out with my wife.


404
00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.126
You're sleeping with little girls.

405
00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:53.698
Hey! Keep your getting voice down.

406
00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.040
I know what it looks like.

407
00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.330
Tell me, Doyle, what does it look like?

408
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.538
I've been in a really
dark place, all right?


409
00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.808
I've been down, and the guys
on the team hooked me up,


410
00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.058
and it was a bad decision, all right?

411
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.308
I had no idea she'd be underage.

412
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:12.868
How is this okay?

413
00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:15.808
Hey, it happened. 
I'm not proud.

414
00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:17.926
You gotta understand, I'm
in serious trouble here, Mitch.


415
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.200
You can't let anyone
else know I paid for it.


416
00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:23.488
I'm gonna make this up to you, man.

417
00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:24.793
I mean, I already have.

418
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.293
Oh, so we're done talking
about you being an idiot?


419
00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.640
You're not hearing me, Mitch.

420
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.910
What is it you
said you always wanted, huh?

421
00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.238
The Macon Club is looking

422
00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.230
for a new third base coach next season.

423
00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:51.178
It's Triple A ball, one
step away from the show.


424
00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.558
It's the real deal.

425
00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.178
And your point?

426
00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.820
Same guy that hooked me
up with the girl, he's got


427
00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.253
connections in the Macon club.

428
00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:03.770
Who is this guy?

429
00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:07.198
I don't know all the details,

430
00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.318
but he's got something on
somebody over there, all right?


431
00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.566
He knows what you saw last night,

432
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:13.018
and he wants you to stay quiet.

433
00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:14.326
What do you mean,
he knows what I saw?

434
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:15.703
How is that even possible?

435
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:18.778
You're not hearing me, Mitch.
The job is yours.


436
00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.578
You just gotta stay quiet, all right?

437
00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.468
I'll get the help I need. 
I promise I will.

438
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.628
But please don't say
anything about last night.


439
00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:25.649
We'll all be okay.

440
00:27:25.691 --> 00:27:26.763
We?

441
00:27:26.805 --> 00:27:28.528
Who else are we talking about, Doyle?

442
00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:30.598
All right, I'm just
saying, as your friend,


443
00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.640
be careful about what decision you make.

444
00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.068
(Mitch sighs)

445
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.311
Just take the job, Mitch.
You deserve it, man.


446
00:27:37.353 --> 00:27:39.178
I mean, how long you been in this?

447
00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.788
Look, all I need to know
is how can I find the girl?


448
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:42.900
Oh, just...

449
00:27:43.805 --> 00:27:46.255
You may never get another shot.
I'd take the job.


450
00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:48.890
Please, man.

451
00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:54.510
You didn't see the way
that girl looked at me.


452
00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:56.900
You didn't see it!

453
00:28:04.572 --> 00:28:07.572
(door bells jangle)

454
00:28:11.068 --> 00:28:13.901
(paper crumpling)

455
00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.380
Come on.

456
00:28:19.476 --> 00:28:20.676
I mean, could you not...

457
00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.203
You don't say too much, do you?

458
00:28:30.518 --> 00:28:32.935
(pats cheek)

459
00:28:37.642 --> 00:28:41.142
(chatter and music on TV)

460
00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:56.330
Sammy, listen.

461
00:29:01.133 --> 00:29:02.758
(Mitch sighs)

462
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.813
I'm serious, I can't help you.

463
00:29:07.013 --> 00:29:09.328
There's just so much going
on in my life right now,


464
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:10.903
and I mean, don't...

465
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:14.278
Don't you have someone
that's looking for you,


466
00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:19.003
like your mom, your dad, family, somebody?

467
00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.293
My mom is in Chicago.

468
00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.823
(somber music)

469
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:31.123
She's an incredible woman.

470
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:35.383
You know, she raised me,
making next to nothing.


471
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.498
One mistake.

472
00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.990
My foster family wouldn't
let me see her anymore.


473
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:51.440
And I haven't seen her since.

474
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:58.348
'Cause I'm scared for what
might have happened to her.


475
00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:59.390
So...

476
00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:05.713
I mean, how did you end up
here, all the way from Chicago?


477
00:30:09.793 --> 00:30:13.228
(Sammy exhales softly)

478
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:17.623
I met this Romeo on an app.

479
00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.593
He was really nice at first.

480
00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.643
And I thought maybe he could
give me back to my mom.


481
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:36.723
So he bought me clothes
and he bought me presents.


482
00:30:36.747 --> 00:30:40.138
(necklace rattles)

483
00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.430
And then, just like
that, everything changed.


484
00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.980
I wasn't allowed to leave his house.

485
00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.130
And then, one night his friends came over.

486
00:30:57.727 --> 00:30:59.977
And I had to make a choice.

487
00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:08.083
Sex with his friends every night,

488
00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.060
or starve.

489
00:31:13.528 --> 00:31:16.611
(cell phone ringing)

490
00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:24.170
Yeah.

491
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.306
I got caught up doing something.

492
00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:32.330
Why? What's up?

493
00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:36.463
Can't you get him?

494
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:40.430
Hello?

495
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:43.490
Great.

496
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:48.600
I guess your hour's up.

497
00:31:50.379 --> 00:31:52.048
This is gonna sound really stupid,

498
00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:54.673
but you're kind of like my hero.

499
00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.293
I know, it sounded stupid.

500
00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:03.410
Mitch...

501
00:32:04.892 --> 00:32:07.198
(bills shuffling)

502
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.240
Thank you.

503
00:32:12.645 --> 00:32:15.228
(horn honking)

504
00:32:19.518 --> 00:32:20.518
This kid.

505
00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.200
So what was the score?

506
00:32:39.396 --> 00:32:40.187
(Mitch snaps fingers)

507
00:32:40.229 --> 00:32:42.493
Evan, I said what was the score?

508
00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:44.630
We lost.

509
00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:46.700
Why do you care?

510
00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.220
Why'd you lose?

511
00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:52.978
I don't know.

512
00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.363
Maybe the other team
scored more runs than us.


513
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:57.741
Can we please just go?

514
00:32:57.783 --> 00:32:59.086
You can't tell me why you lost?

515
00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:00.283
Who cares?

516
00:33:01.919 --> 00:33:02.919
(Mitch sighs)

517
00:33:02.959 --> 00:33:06.058
(engine sputters)

518
00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.081
Come on, come on!

519
00:33:08.123 --> 00:33:10.508
(engine sputtering)

520
00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.178
(Mitch sighs)

521
00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:15.208
That's exactly why I tell
you you gotta play hard.


522
00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:16.318
You gotta play hard!

523
00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.718
So we lost because I wasn't playing hard?

524
00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:19.683
That's not what I mean.

525
00:33:19.725 --> 00:33:21.238
Whatever.

526
00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.380
I'm only playing 'cause
mom said I had to.

527
00:33:25.684 --> 00:33:30.017
Evan... (sighs)

528
00:33:32.143 --> 00:33:37.143
(door opens) (children shouting)

529
00:33:38.791 --> 00:33:41.208
(door slams)

530
00:33:44.601 --> 00:33:47.934
(door opens and closes)

531
00:33:48.867 --> 00:33:53.867
Mom? Dad? (tense music)

532
00:33:54.957 --> 00:33:55.957
Hm.

533
00:34:05.948 --> 00:34:06.948
15 across.

534
00:34:24.832 --> 00:34:27.415
(VCR rattling)

535
00:34:29.196 --> 00:34:32.364
(music playing on TV)

536
00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.520
(guns firing on TV)

537
00:34:49.057 --> 00:34:52.624
(TV static crackling)

538
00:34:52.665 --> 00:34:55.333
(moaning on TV)

539
00:34:58.926 --> 00:35:01.343
(door opens)

540
00:35:06.492 --> 00:35:08.325
Where's your mother?

541
00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.506
(performer laughing on TV)

542
00:35:12.548 --> 00:35:15.178
(rummaging in box)

543
00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.820
These will be in the garage
behind the tool cabinet.


544
00:35:20.184 --> 00:35:20.975
(magazine thuds)

545
00:35:21.017 --> 00:35:22.260
'Bout time you become a man.

546
00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:24.110
Have at it.

547
00:35:35.853 --> 00:35:38.520
(moaning on TV)

548
00:35:44.279 --> 00:35:46.696
(door opens)

549
00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:50.518
Daddy, I did good at gymnastics today.

550
00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.660
That's great, honey.

551
00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.748
Hey, I thought you were
going to get groceries.


552
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:05.878
We don't have anything for dinner.

553
00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.708
Listen, I got some great news.

554
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:10.018
My card was declined
at the grocery store.


555
00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.158
Huh?

556
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:15.043
Alyssa, Evan, dinner, now!

557
00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:21.208
Listen, so, a job opened,
a coaching job in Macon.


558
00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:22.828
They think I'd be great for it.

559
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:24.778
I'm talking Triple
-A affiliate.

560
00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.238
Amber, this is one step
away from the big show.


561
00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.648
See if this is spoiled.

562
00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:29.840
Does it pay a lot more?

563
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:33.062
Kids, dinner!

564
00:36:33.104 --> 00:36:34.066
(Mitch groans)

565
00:36:34.108 --> 00:36:37.798
(cereal bag rustling)

566
00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.631
What does that matter?

567
00:36:38.673 --> 00:36:40.408
Mom, do we have any milk?

568
00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:43.348
No, honey. You're gonna
have to eat it without milk.


569
00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:46.048
Evan, get out here!

570
00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:47.188
I don't understand.

571
00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:50.379
What's the point if there's
not more money involved?


572
00:36:50.421 --> 00:36:53.099
(bowls clinking)

573
00:36:53.141 --> 00:36:55.378
[Mitch] Look, this is finally our break.

574
00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.870
Now, we've been waiting
for this for a long time.


575
00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:01.663
Evan, you eat with this family!

576
00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.548
They didn't want you before. Why now?

577
00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.618
What does that mean?
This time is different.


578
00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.928
Mom, do we have any orange juice?

579
00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:12.208
We can't just move our
whole family on a whim.


580
00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:13.948
It is not a whim.

581
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:17.583
I have been working for
this for a long time, Amber.


582
00:37:17.625 --> 00:37:21.842
You know, I can't think
about this right now.


583
00:37:21.884 --> 00:37:24.688
You know what, you don't
have to think about it,


584
00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:27.913
because it's not your decision,
and I am taking the job.


585
00:37:28.968 --> 00:37:29.759
(refrigerator door slams)

586
00:37:29.801 --> 00:37:33.178
(car alarm blaring)

587
00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:37.093
Alyssa, go share your cereal with Ruby.

588
00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:41.653
[Alyssa] Ruby, 
I have some food for us.

589
00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:52.228
Why is it that, the one time
something good happens to me,


590
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:53.383
this is how you act?

591
00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.508
What do you expect from me?

592
00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:00.673
I'm trying to figure out a
way to feed our children!


593
00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:05.698
I stood in line at the
grocery store for 20 minutes,


594
00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:07.348
only to have people gawk at me

595
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:09.508
while some 18-year-old cashier tells me

596
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:12.598
I didn't have enough
money to feed my family!


597
00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.748
I had to leave the groceries
just sitting there!


598
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:17.218
But then you come in here

599
00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:20.518
and wanna move our whole
family to another state,


600
00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.388
just like that.

601
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:25.378
I have told you that it
is different this time!


602
00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.438
Oh, it's a sure thing then, huh?

603
00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.048
Yes, Amber, it is a sure thing!

604
00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:32.090
Wow.

605
00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:36.478
Well then I guess you better
pack your bags for Macon.


606
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.118
Meanwhile, I have to
go admit to my mom

607
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.013
that I can't feed my own kids!

608
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:46.738
Yeah, go run to mommy. (keys jangling)

609
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:47.571
You disgust me.

610
00:38:47.613 --> 00:38:48.623
Like you always do.

611
00:38:49.813 --> 00:38:51.648
(door opens and slams)

612
00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:54.523
(loud clattering)

613
00:38:57.839 --> 00:39:00.839
(crickets chirping)

614
00:39:09.619 --> 00:39:12.119
(Mitch sighs)

615
00:39:46.687 --> 00:39:49.432
(birds chirping)

616
00:39:49.474 --> 00:39:51.891
(chattering)

617
00:39:56.435 --> 00:39:58.935
(door closes)

618
00:40:01.425 --> 00:40:03.925
(Mitch yawns)

619
00:40:08.256 --> 00:40:10.457
(emotional music)

620
00:40:10.499 --> 00:40:13.230
(shower running)

621
00:40:13.272 --> 00:40:15.058
That goes without saying, man.

622
00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.698
Girls have like this
clock mechanism, right?


623
00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:19.228
It's like a time bomb starts ticking

624
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:20.870
when they're still pretty young.

625
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.986
[Hunter] Spare me the
sixth grade health class.


626
00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:25.546
No, no, no. You gotta
listen to what I'm saying.


627
00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:28.378
That's what got me outta my
hitting slump last season.


628
00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.644
But let me ask you a question.

629
00:40:30.686 --> 00:40:32.338
If someone were to give you a tool

630
00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.168
to make you a better ball player,

631
00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:37.213
wouldn't you be stupid not
to use it, like every day?


632
00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:41.308
I'm telling you man, these
girls are the magic drug.


633
00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:42.526
They keep me playing like a man

634
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.638
that's gonna be in the Majors soon.

635
00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.990
I tried 'em all: cleat
chasers, other guys' wives.


636
00:40:49.032 --> 00:40:49.823
(Hunter laughing)

637
00:40:49.865 --> 00:40:51.328
I'm serious!

638
00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:52.936
The younger ones give
you everything you need,


639
00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.035
and the best part about
is they don't talk back.


640
00:40:55.077 --> 00:40:55.868
(Hunter scoffs)

641
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:57.898
Whatever, man. 
I'm not some kind of perv.

642
00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:59.668
You wanna have a good game tomorrow?

643
00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:04.258
It'll help, guaranteed, or your money back.

644
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.478
I'll hook you up, no worries.

645
00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.400
You just gotta tell me
what you're looking for.


646
00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:10.588
I don't know.

647
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:12.913
I get it. I was like that too.

648
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:14.661
Let me tell you something.

649
00:41:14.703 --> 00:41:16.528
There's a lot of people into this,

650
00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:18.928
and we all look out for each other.

651
00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:22.168
You know that scout
coming to see me, huh?

652
00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:25.348
I'll make sure he looks at you, man.
I got you.


653
00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:26.893
Besides you can't go wrong.

654
00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:29.386
I'm telling you, 
I test all the merch

655
00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:31.678
before I recommended to the general public.

656
00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.318
Look. See this one right here?

657
00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.376
Right on the edge of being
too old, but still mighty...


658
00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.296
I'm telling you, right on
the edge of being too old,


659
00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.348
- but still mighty fine.
- Come on.


660
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:42.624
I think they call her Joy.

661
00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:45.166
Whatever her name is, she
brought me a lot of joy.


662
00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:48.823
So I'll hook you up.

663
00:41:50.029 --> 00:41:52.696
(pensive music)

664
00:41:58.789 --> 00:42:02.122
(baseball bat slamming)

665
00:42:18.538 --> 00:42:19.329
[Sammy] Mm!

666
00:42:19.371 --> 00:42:20.860
Don't these people feed you?

667
00:42:21.711 --> 00:42:22.911
This is so incredible.

668
00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:26.930
Thank you.

669
00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.938
So, I think we need to talk about

670
00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:34.873
getting you out of this situation.

671
00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:38.159
What do you think about the
police taking care of you?


672
00:42:38.183 --> 00:42:39.388
I mean, it is their job.

673
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:41.280
And I'm right back where I started,

674
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:45.403
in some foster home and
no closer to my mom.


675
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:47.270
So, no.

676
00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:51.103
I know I met you for a reason.

677
00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:54.333
You'll think of something.

678
00:42:57.415 --> 00:42:59.556
(Mitch sighs)

679
00:42:59.598 --> 00:43:02.668
There's gotta be some type
of halfway house for girls,


680
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:04.168
shelter, program, something.

681
00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:05.788
No!

682
00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:08.600
Look, I want to help you.

683
00:43:08.642 --> 00:43:09.433
- I just cant'-
- Hey baby.


684
00:43:09.475 --> 00:43:11.638
(troubling music)

685
00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:12.471
Oh, crap.

686
00:43:12.513 --> 00:43:13.304
[Gibson] Another two.

687
00:43:13.346 --> 00:43:14.346
No, don't look.

688
00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:20.073
I had an appointment with
that guy the other night.


689
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.520
Hold on.

690
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:41.880
How many of these
guys paid you to, um...

691
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:45.230
Him.

692
00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:48.874
Him.

693
00:43:48.916 --> 00:43:49.916
Him.

694
00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:54.568
Then there's you.

695
00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:56.443
Seriously. Listen.

696
00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.198
What do you think about us
trying to get you into a program,


697
00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.240
a shelter?

698
00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:05.290
You're a good guy, Mitch.

699
00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:08.900
Good heart.

700
00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:13.070
You'll think of something.

701
00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:17.788
Think we can do ice cream next time?

702
00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:18.830
Yes.

703
00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:23.833
Tomorrow night, ice cream, you and me.

704
00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:26.810
Pinkie swear.

705
00:44:28.362 --> 00:44:30.945
(gentle music)

706
00:44:35.821 --> 00:44:37.678
(kisses cheek)

707
00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.720
Thank you.

708
00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.248
Tomorrow.

709
00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:42.448
Tomorrow.

710
00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:43.490
Sammy.

711
00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:46.590
Take care of yourself.

712
00:44:49.927 --> 00:44:52.427
(Mitch sighs)

713
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:56.013
That girl's a little young
for you, don't you think?


714
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:58.078
It's not like that.

715
00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.120
It was a joke.

716
00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.238
Can I help you?

717
00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.071
Yeah.

718
00:45:04.113 --> 00:45:06.418
You seemed pretty distraught when she left,

719
00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:09.013
so I thought this would
make you feel better.


720
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:16.558
You wanna talk about it?

721
00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.600
Not really.

722
00:45:24.851 --> 00:45:26.066
(Mitch sighs)

723
00:45:26.108 --> 00:45:28.941
Look, there are problems that...

724
00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:35.443
That I'm just trying to
figure out right now, okay?


725
00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:40.633
My advice is to just walk away.

726
00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:44.548
When you're in between
two impossible choices,


727
00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:47.070
no one ever sees the third option.

728
00:45:47.112 --> 00:45:50.278
(Mitch sighs)

729
00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.623
At least get away from
thinking about it for a while.


730
00:45:55.957 --> 00:45:59.430
I can tell just by looking
at you that you need a break.


731
00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:01.993
You play baseball, right?

732
00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:04.880
You busy tomorrow?

733
00:46:05.967 --> 00:46:08.717
(exciting music)

734
00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:10.987
Come on! (smacks glove)

735
00:46:11.029 --> 00:46:12.029
Attaboy!

736
00:46:12.061 --> 00:46:13.061
Here we go!

737
00:46:15.183 --> 00:46:16.183
(baseball bat whacks)

738
00:46:16.209 --> 00:46:19.162
(crowd cheering)

739
00:46:19.204 --> 00:46:22.883
(baseball thuds into glove)

740
00:46:22.925 --> 00:46:25.675
(exciting music)

741
00:46:32.827 --> 00:46:34.123
You're out!

742
00:46:34.165 --> 00:46:36.915
(crowd cheering)

743
00:46:41.267 --> 00:46:42.058
(baseball bat whacks)

744
00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.850
(crowd cheering)

745
00:46:49.037 --> 00:46:52.204
(baseball bat whacks)

746
00:46:53.624 --> 00:46:57.216
(manager clapping)

747
00:46:57.258 --> 00:46:58.448
(baseball back whacks)

748
00:46:58.490 --> 00:47:02.573
(audience cheering and clapping)

749
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:13.960
(exciting music)

750
00:47:19.083 --> 00:47:20.298
Hey, here we go! Attaboy!

751
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.048
Look alive!

752
00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:24.840
(exciting music)

753
00:47:31.154 --> 00:47:35.830
(baseball bat whacks) (crowd cheering)

754
00:47:35.872 --> 00:47:39.145
(suspenseful music)

755
00:47:39.187 --> 00:47:39.978
(Diya gasps)

756
00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:43.853
(crowd cheering and clapping)

757
00:47:47.647 --> 00:47:50.397
(ethereal music)

758
00:48:05.949 --> 00:48:08.616
(bell jangling)

759
00:48:17.158 --> 00:48:18.825
When my wife left,

760
00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.283
she took the kids and filed for divorce.

761
00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:29.938
Shame.

762
00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:30.980
Yeah.

763
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:35.023
I screwed up, Mitch.

764
00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.560
I don't know what to do.

765
00:48:40.683 --> 00:48:42.673
I don't wanna lose my kids.

766
00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.623
I just wish I could start over.

767
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:54.710
Yeah.

768
00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:58.010
A little late for that.

769
00:48:58.052 --> 00:49:00.802
(delicate music)

770
00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:14.883
(players chattering)

771
00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:57.778
[Diya] It's about time.

772
00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:58.820
It's for you.

773
00:50:00.967 --> 00:50:04.738
You never ever wanna take
your eye off the ball.


774
00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:05.571
All right.

775
00:50:05.613 --> 00:50:08.320
As long as you keep your eye
on the ball, you can't miss.


776
00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:10.700
Watch and learn.

777
00:50:13.237 --> 00:50:15.568
(baseball bat whacks)

778
00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:18.478
You try. Let's see what you got.

779
00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:21.523
So what is this for drunk
bar employees or what?


780
00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.718
Let's just see what you got.

781
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:25.936
What are you doing with your hands?

782
00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.658
I don't know.

783
00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.446
You're holding that thing
like it's a broomstick. Look.


784
00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:30.261
Okay.

785
00:50:30.303 --> 00:50:34.378
All right, so, hands
right here, slight grip.


786
00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:36.178
Put your knuckles this way.

787
00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:38.428
And you want to
put your hands up here.

788
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:42.628
Wanna get a nice pull
back, follow through, okay?


789
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:43.670
There you go.

790
00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:45.950
Keep your eye on the ball.

791
00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:50.559
And don't hit like a girl.

792
00:50:50.601 --> 00:50:53.758
(Diya gasps)

793
00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:54.800
Wait.

794
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:57.710
Hands.

795
00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:01.603
These knuckles line up right here.

796
00:51:03.625 --> 00:51:04.625
All right?

797
00:51:09.874 --> 00:51:10.665
(baseball bat whacks)

798
00:51:10.707 --> 00:51:12.860
[Diya] So, how long
have you been playing?


799
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:15.470
A long time.

800
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:22.093
You hit like you're
trying to prove something,


801
00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:25.813
almost angry.

802
00:51:28.570 --> 00:51:29.570
I'm sorry.

803
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:33.493
That's okay. I like it.

804
00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:44.803
What would you have if
you could have anything?


805
00:51:47.648 --> 00:51:50.696
(Mitch sighs)

806
00:51:50.738 --> 00:51:51.738
I...

807
00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:56.023
I don't think having
anything is even an option,


808
00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:58.588
so why think about it?

809
00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:00.573
It's good to think about those things.

810
00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:04.680
Only leads to disappointment.

811
00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.280
Who hurt you?

812
00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:13.340
I'm a realist.

813
00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:16.108
It doesn't matter.

814
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:20.968
It's about taking control of
what's right in front of you.


815
00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:23.743
If we don't do that, the
world will control us.


816
00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:27.920
What about you?

817
00:52:29.654 --> 00:52:32.593
I mean, no offense, you're a waitress.

818
00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.988
Is that what you wanted to do,

819
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:39.388
or should you be taking control?

820
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:40.430
Touche.

821
00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:46.033
I actually plan to start my
own sports-themed restaurant.


822
00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:49.708
It's a big deal. A whole
chain of 'em, you know?


823
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:52.843
Put all these other bars and
restaurants out of business.


824
00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.693
Spread across the country eventually.

825
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:59.640
So what's stopping you?

826
00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:02.878
What's stopping you

827
00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.670
from playing ball somewhere
other than this dumpy town?


828
00:53:10.141 --> 00:53:11.049
You don't mess around, do you?

829
00:53:11.091 --> 00:53:13.843
Mm. You didn't answer my question.

830
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:17.428
A lot of things.

831
00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:22.470
Yeah, but does it have to,
or are you just letting it?


832
00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:23.990
That's not fair.

833
00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:27.808
I mean, seriously, there are people, things

834
00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:29.743
that are just outta my control.

835
00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:34.168
And I mean, we can't all control everything

836
00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:35.698
like we're some god or something.

837
00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:37.828
So you take what you can control,

838
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:39.883
and you walk away from what you can't.

839
00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:43.963
Mitch, you can't tell
me that's not an option.


840
00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:46.700
What's stopping you?

841
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.100
What's stopping you?

842
00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:01.800
I'm waiting for the perfect
partner to come along.


843
00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:07.108
You're looking for a man with money.

844
00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:09.253
Money will come in time. No.

845
00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:13.153
I need a real partner.

846
00:54:14.890 --> 00:54:19.317
Someone who's passionate and driven.

847
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:22.723
Kind.

848
00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:25.543
An athlete.

849
00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.201
Someone who knows what he wants.

850
00:54:32.243 --> 00:54:35.076
(emotional music)

851
00:54:47.696 --> 00:54:48.748
You think I'm ready?

852
00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:52.116
Yeah. You are a regular Ty Cobb.

853
00:54:52.158 --> 00:54:53.308
(Diya laughs)

854
00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:54.673
I do like the Tigers.

855
00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.903
Have you thought about what I said?

856
00:55:10.570 --> 00:55:11.570
What's that?

857
00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:15.043
About taking the third option?

858
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:20.150
Yeah.

859
00:55:21.692 --> 00:55:23.818
(Mitch chuckles)

860
00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:24.860
I just...

861
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:28.220
If I could figure out what that is.

862
00:55:30.896 --> 00:55:32.943
I don't think it's
that hard to figure out.


863
00:55:38.590 --> 00:55:39.590
This...

864
00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:42.268
This is you, right?

865
00:55:42.310 --> 00:55:43.310
Yeah.

866
00:55:52.001 --> 00:55:53.001
I...

867
00:55:58.420 --> 00:55:59.728
I just...

868
00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:00.770
I just wanna say

869
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:04.173
I appreciate you talking to me today.

870
00:56:05.966 --> 00:56:06.966
It helped.

871
00:56:19.002 --> 00:56:22.669
I'm good at solving
all kinds of problems.


872
00:56:23.681 --> 00:56:26.514
(car keys jangle)

873
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:30.367
(soft music)

874
00:56:47.742 --> 00:56:50.242
(Mitch sighs)

875
00:56:53.086 --> 00:56:56.102
(Mitch grumbles)

876
00:56:56.144 --> 00:56:58.311
Come on, Mitch. Come on.

877
00:57:07.171 --> 00:57:10.171
(door bells jangle)

878
00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:12.860
Hey.

879
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:18.763
Listen, I know it's not check-in time.

880
00:57:21.996 --> 00:57:23.420
(Mitch sighs)

881
00:57:23.462 --> 00:57:26.212
(bills rustling)

882
00:57:30.429 --> 00:57:33.179
(bills rustling)

883
00:57:36.709 --> 00:57:39.459
(bills rustling)

884
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:53.050
Pleasure doing business with you.

885
00:57:53.092 --> 00:57:55.842
(birds chirping)

886
00:58:02.912 --> 00:58:06.073
(knocking on door)

887
00:58:06.115 --> 00:58:08.878
(door opens)

888
00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:09.920
Hey.

889
00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:12.141
Hey, wait!

890
00:58:12.183 --> 00:58:13.131
Wait, I need to talk-

891
00:58:13.173 --> 00:58:14.173
- Get off of me!

892
00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:16.603
Look, I just want to talk, please.
I'm sorry.


893
00:58:24.419 --> 00:58:27.252
(emotional music)

894
00:58:30.128 --> 00:58:33.795
(phone beeping and ringing)

895
00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:42.560
I screwed up.

896
00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:46.550
I'm sorry.

897
00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.833
I screwed up. I know that.

898
00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:59.083
Say something, anything, please!

899
00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:07.333
I didn't mean to hurt you.

900
00:59:08.905 --> 00:59:10.620
I just...

901
00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:23.353
What happened? Who did this?

902
00:59:28.074 --> 00:59:29.758
You did this.

903
00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:31.450
If this is about the ice cream,

904
00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:35.233
we can go get ice cream, and
we can go talk right now.


905
00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:39.680
Listen.

906
00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:41.626
I thought about what you said

907
00:59:41.650 --> 00:59:46.650
and about trying to figure
out the right thing to do.


908
00:59:46.917 --> 00:59:49.303
Just give me the money
for this hour and go.


909
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.000
Okay.

910
00:59:57.010 --> 00:59:58.798
You're mad, huh?

911
00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:03.823
I get it. You're mad,
you're upset, you're angry.


912
01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:07.063
But what did you expect from me?

913
01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:09.673
What did you want me to do?

914
01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:14.038
I told you, I am nobody's superhero,

915
01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.048
and you refused to accept that!

916
01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:17.090
Stop!

917
01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:22.303
They raped me, Mitch!

918
01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.078
(emotional music)

919
01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.713
That's what they do to us.

920
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.153
If we can't pay back the
money, that's what they do.


921
01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:36.503
And then they sell it to porn websites.

922
01:00:36.545 --> 01:00:38.938
(emotional music)

923
01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:41.383
So just give me the money and go!

924
01:00:47.331 --> 01:00:48.331
I'm sorry.

925
01:00:50.036 --> 01:00:51.875
[Sammy] Go!

926
01:00:51.917 --> 01:00:54.667
(bills rustling)

927
01:01:00.037 --> 01:01:00.828
[Mitch] Sammy-

928
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:02.333
- Don't call me that! Just go!

929
01:01:03.343 --> 01:01:06.176
(emotional music)

930
01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:09.923
Just go, Mitch! Go!

931
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:15.264
(door opens and closes)

932
01:01:15.306 --> 01:01:18.056
(dramatic music)

933
01:01:21.864 --> 01:01:24.531
(Sammy sobbing)

934
01:01:31.812 --> 01:01:32.812
Please!

935
01:01:34.052 --> 01:01:36.507
(Sammy screaming)

936
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:37.403
(engine sputtering)

937
01:01:37.445 --> 01:01:39.485
[Mitch] Come on.

938
01:01:39.527 --> 01:01:41.801
(engine sputtering)

939
01:01:41.843 --> 01:01:44.343
(Mitch sighs)

940
01:01:45.832 --> 01:01:48.249
(horn honks)

941
01:01:52.975 --> 01:01:55.392
(door slams)

942
01:02:01.412 --> 01:02:04.495
(cell phone ringing)

943
01:02:12.001 --> 01:02:12.903
Hello?

944
01:02:12.945 --> 01:02:15.945
(car hood rattling)

945
01:02:22.233 --> 01:02:24.900
(phone ringing)

946
01:02:32.726 --> 01:02:33.726
What?

947
01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:36.321
Nothing, I'm just getting-

948
01:02:36.363 --> 01:02:37.978
- Evan's coach just called.

949
01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.973
He got kicked off the baseball team!

950
01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:41.991
What'd he do?

951
01:02:42.033 --> 01:02:43.198
You need to ask him.

952
01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.308
Can't you tell me?

953
01:02:44.350 --> 01:02:46.738
Mitch, your son needs you.

954
01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:48.028
I'll just call the coach.

955
01:02:48.070 --> 01:02:50.218
So you're not gonna
have a talk with your son?


956
01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:51.388
I don't see why.

957
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:52.430
Okay.

958
01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:54.898
Well then maybe you can tell me

959
01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:58.918
about some credit card charges to a motel.

960
01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.358
Listen, it must be a mistake.

961
01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.488
Several times this week?

962
01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:05.098
Some cheap motel here in town.

963
01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:08.308
And cash withdrawals.
Mitch, what's going on?


964
01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:10.426
I don't know. Probably
identity theft or something.


965
01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:11.450
Come on, Amber.

966
01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.566
Okay, well, you're gonna
have to get another job


967
01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:17.390
off season this year, because
we've got next to nothing.


968
01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:21.049
Somebody probably stole
my credit card number, okay?


969
01:03:21.091 --> 01:03:21.898
I mean, idiots.

970
01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:24.940
They could have chose a better
place than the Sunrise Motel.


971
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:35.150
Amber.

972
01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:38.758
Amber?

973
01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.800
Amber.

974
01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:43.500
What is it that you're looking for?

975
01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:49.690
Pick your things up when we're not home.

976
01:03:49.732 --> 01:03:50.523
(cell phone beeps)

977
01:03:50.565 --> 01:03:52.356
(slams down cell phone)

978
01:03:52.398 --> 01:03:55.120
(slamming groceries)

979
01:03:55.162 --> 01:03:56.751
(slams cabinet door)

980
01:03:56.793 --> 01:04:00.232
(Amber sobbing)

981
01:04:00.274 --> 01:04:02.941
(droning music)

982
01:04:24.412 --> 01:04:27.579
(baseball bat whacks)

983
01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:33.290
Hey, Mitch.

984
01:04:35.262 --> 01:04:37.762
(Mitch sighs)

985
01:04:39.579 --> 01:04:42.988
I'm trying to get that
help I was talking about.


986
01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:44.230
Just wanted you to know.

987
01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.130
Do you have any idea
what you did to that girl?


988
01:04:57.250 --> 01:05:02.250
No, but you can help her.
I think they'd sell her to you.


989
01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:08.428
This whole thing is your freaking fault.

990
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:09.970
Why don't you take care of it?

991
01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:14.530
You're gonna make it, Mitch.

992
01:05:29.171 --> 01:05:30.838
[Mitch] You seen Gibson?

993
01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.098
Gibson? Yeah.

994
01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.388
I had him running sprints

995
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:34.636
from mouthing off in the sixth again.

996
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:36.658
He's like a nine-year-old kid, this guy.

997
01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:37.966
I think he's out in the showers.

998
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.990
Hold up a second.

999
01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.533
Congratulations.

1000
01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.428
I heard on the Triple
-A coaching job.

1001
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:45.598
They're lucky to have you.

1002
01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:46.431
Yeah, thanks.

1003
01:05:46.473 --> 01:05:47.264
We're gonna miss you here.

1004
01:05:47.306 --> 01:05:49.003
Hey, just receive what I'm telling you.

1005
01:05:50.290 --> 01:05:52.090
We're seriously gonna miss you here.

1006
01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:54.590
I got something else for you.

1007
01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:59.518
It's even got your name on it.

1008
01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:04.408
Listen up, tomorrow,
ownership's gonna be here.


1009
01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:07.888
I need you to be here
in uniform, 5:30 sharp.


1010
01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:09.778
I got it. I'll be here.

1011
01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:11.220
All right, get outta here.

1012
01:06:12.856 --> 01:06:14.273
[Mitch] Gibson!

1013
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:19.243
Gibson! (shower running)

1014
01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.135
Gibson, I know you're in there.

1015
01:06:22.177 --> 01:06:23.383
Hey there, Jennings.

1016
01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:26.353
Appreciate the visit, but I gotta say,

1017
01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.058
I didn't think you
were that kind of guy.

1018
01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.300
But, hey, no judgment here, man.
You do you.


1019
01:06:33.751 --> 01:06:36.982
You gonna hand me my towel,
or should I post for a picture?


1020
01:06:37.024 --> 01:06:37.918
(Gibson laughs)

1021
01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.260
I know what you're into.

1022
01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:41.368
Little more specific.

1023
01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:43.018
You know what I'm talking about.

1024
01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:44.660
You don't know jack, Jennings.

1025
01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.918
You know, I heard something
about you the other day though.


1026
01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.268
What's that?

1027
01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:52.996
Something about you spending quality time

1028
01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.523
with Doyle's teenage escort.

1029
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:58.371
Let's see, what did
they say her name was?

1030
01:06:58.413 --> 01:07:00.246
Was it Trent?

1031
01:07:00.288 --> 01:07:01.489
No, that's not it.

1032
01:07:01.531 --> 01:07:02.531
Devil?

1033
01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:05.923
Was it Joy?

1034
01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:09.277
I hate you.

1035
01:07:09.319 --> 01:07:10.110
(Gibson snickers)

1036
01:07:10.152 --> 01:07:11.152
I don't care.

1037
01:07:12.490 --> 01:07:14.878
So that coaching job
that Doyle told me about,


1038
01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:15.718
that was you, huh?

1039
01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.718
Congratulations on that by the way.
You deserve it.


1040
01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:21.568
There is no way that you
have that kind of power.


1041
01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:22.738
Maybe.

1042
01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:24.388
Or maybe it's possible

1043
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:25.288
that one of the big wigs there

1044
01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:27.193
has a thing for 14-year-old blondes.

1045
01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.568
Maybe.

1046
01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:32.428
I wanna buy the girl.

1047
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:33.470
Samantha.

1048
01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:35.338
Joy.

1049
01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.210
Wow. Is she that good?

1050
01:07:39.603 --> 01:07:41.683
I could kill you right now.

1051
01:07:44.110 --> 01:07:46.438
But if I keep my mouth shut,

1052
01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.998
I get the coaching job, you
hook me up to by the girl,


1053
01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:53.743
I give her her life back, everybody wins.

1054
01:07:54.730 --> 01:07:57.838
Everybody wins. (snickers)

1055
01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:01.138
You know, do what you want, Jennings.

1056
01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:02.068
You take her off the street,

1057
01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:04.138
another one will be right behind her.

1058
01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.808
We're doing it a favor.

1059
01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:09.100
It's probably the best
life she's ever known.


1060
01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:14.180
You know, I'd watch yourself.

1061
01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:18.627
Those big league clubs
are real flaky about hiring,


1062
01:08:18.670 --> 01:08:19.869
change their mind a lot.

1063
01:08:25.807 --> 01:08:28.225
(door slams)

1064
01:08:40.047 --> 01:08:42.547
(Mitch sighs)

1065
01:08:50.190 --> 01:08:53.023
(troubling music)

1066
01:09:06.271 --> 01:09:08.855
(Mitch groans)

1067
01:09:17.188 --> 01:09:20.188
(envelope rustling)

1068
01:09:48.234 --> 01:09:50.734
(bag zipping)

1069
01:09:56.589 --> 01:09:59.089
(Mitch sighs)

1070
01:10:02.892 --> 01:10:05.725
(emotional music)

1071
01:10:13.585 --> 01:10:17.002
(picture frame clatters)

1072
01:10:23.324 --> 01:10:26.324
(envelope rustling)

1073
01:10:29.473 --> 01:10:32.306
(emotional music)

1074
01:10:35.811 --> 01:10:38.311
(Mitch sighs)

1075
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:58.840
So, I'll be staying
for a while this time.


1076
01:11:02.466 --> 01:11:05.466
(envelope rustling)

1077
01:11:30.704 --> 01:11:34.442
(door bells jangle)

1078
01:11:34.484 --> 01:11:35.758
(phone dialing)

1079
01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:38.633
(emotional music)

1080
01:12:12.674 --> 01:12:15.257
(Mitch groans)

1081
01:12:32.479 --> 01:12:35.229
(Mitch groaning)

1082
01:12:56.279 --> 01:12:59.779
(Mitch breathing heavily)

1083
01:13:32.429 --> 01:13:35.179
(delicate music)

1084
01:13:49.395 --> 01:13:52.395
(crickets chirping)

1085
01:13:54.374 --> 01:13:59.374
(banging on door) (Mitch gasps)

1086
01:14:01.243 --> 01:14:03.743
(engine revs)

1087
01:14:14.611 --> 01:14:17.444
(dramatic music)

1088
01:14:27.877 --> 01:14:30.545
(bag unzipping)

1089
01:14:54.237 --> 01:14:56.728
I will decide what that
worthless child needs.


1090
01:14:56.770 --> 01:14:58.648
He is just a boy.

1091
01:14:58.690 --> 01:14:59.481
Just a boy?

1092
01:14:59.523 --> 01:15:01.348
He's an embarrassment to the family!

1093
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:03.568
You want that representing our last name?

1094
01:15:03.609 --> 01:15:04.978
Jerry... Shut up!

1095
01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:06.020
Gimme that.

1096
01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.248
Lemme show you.

1097
01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:10.228
Math, F.

1098
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:11.967
Science, D.

1099
01:15:12.010 --> 01:15:13.918
Oh, whoop-de-do, he's got an A in PE.

1100
01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:14.751
You're being unreasonable.

1101
01:15:14.793 --> 01:15:16.078
I said shut up!

1102
01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:17.638
I've seen him play baseball!

1103
01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.263
He's gonna be unemployed and homeless!

1104
01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:23.290
- Oh, God.
- Mitch!


1105
01:15:23.332 --> 01:15:24.148
Get out here right now!

1106
01:15:24.190 --> 01:15:26.098
Jerry, would you please... Shut up!

1107
01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:27.717
Mitch, get out here right now!

1108
01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:29.053
I know you heard me, boy!

1109
01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:32.578
What you gotta say about this, huh?

1110
01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:33.898
Huh?

1111
01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:35.690
What do you have to say about this?

1112
01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:37.551
I don't know.

1113
01:15:37.592 --> 01:15:39.268
What do you mean you don't know?

1114
01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:41.068
You don't know?

1115
01:15:41.109 --> 01:15:41.901
I'm gonna help you know.

1116
01:15:41.943 --> 01:15:42.734
No, no. No, no, no.

1117
01:15:42.776 --> 01:15:43.787
I'll do better. I'll do-

1118
01:15:43.829 --> 01:15:44.620
(slaps face)

1119
01:15:44.662 --> 01:15:45.688
Huh?

1120
01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:48.032
You gonna get an F
in math next time, huh?

1121
01:15:48.074 --> 01:15:49.259
You gonna get an F in math, huh?

1122
01:15:49.283 --> 01:15:50.132
(Mitch whimpers)

1123
01:15:50.174 --> 01:15:50.965
Hm?

1124
01:15:51.007 --> 01:15:51.934
(door opens)

1125
01:15:51.975 --> 01:15:52.767
Woman, give me that!

1126
01:15:52.809 --> 01:15:53.724
(Illean gasps)

1127
01:15:53.766 --> 01:15:55.555
[Illean] No! (sobbing)

1128
01:15:55.597 --> 01:15:56.866
Oh, you gonna come up on me, huh?

1129
01:15:56.890 --> 01:15:59.233
Huh? You a man now, huh?

1130
01:16:02.410 --> 01:16:04.258
Don't none of y'all touch my bat!

1131
01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:05.300
Ever!

1132
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:07.678
You understand me, boy?

1133
01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:08.758
Huh?

1134
01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:09.598
Don't you ever touch this.

1135
01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.818
You are not worth touching this!

1136
01:16:11.859 --> 01:16:12.859
Get outta my way.

1137
01:16:14.877 --> 01:16:17.627
(Illean sobbing)

1138
01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:21.170
Oh, God.

1139
01:16:25.287 --> 01:16:28.348
(horn honking)

1140
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:30.448
Hey there.

1141
01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:31.678
Gimme a minute.

1142
01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:36.118
I have 800. I only need 1,700 more.

1143
01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:39.103
And I promise, I will pay
you back as soon as I can.


1144
01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.255
I just thought that you would
be one of those kind of girls


1145
01:16:42.279 --> 01:16:46.437
that would have that kind
of money laying around.


1146
01:16:47.413 --> 01:16:51.297
$1,700 just laying around, Mitch?

1147
01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:55.693
For what, a divorce lawyer?

1148
01:16:59.981 --> 01:17:00.981
No.

1149
01:17:02.770 --> 01:17:04.422
Why can't you hear me?

1150
01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:10.138
I am offering you a life without problems,

1151
01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:12.223
your dreams, Mitch.

1152
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:15.148
We can do it together.

1153
01:17:15.190 --> 01:17:17.353
We can just leave this place.

1154
01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.383
Just you and me.

1155
01:17:22.803 --> 01:17:24.203
I found the perfect partner.

1156
01:17:33.845 --> 01:17:34.845
Is...

1157
01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:36.740
Is this about me?

1158
01:17:38.797 --> 01:17:40.723
Or is this about your business dreams.

1159
01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.603
I am offering you everything.

1160
01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:55.513
Can't you see that?

1161
01:17:57.884 --> 01:17:59.560
We could...

1162
01:17:59.602 --> 01:18:02.011
We could start here if you wanted to.

1163
01:18:02.053 --> 01:18:03.053
We could...

1164
01:18:06.186 --> 01:18:07.186
I'm sorry.

1165
01:18:10.144 --> 01:18:11.977
I've made my decision.

1166
01:18:17.338 --> 01:18:18.338
Mitch.

1167
01:18:23.650 --> 01:18:25.623
What else could look this good?

1168
01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:34.558
What, are you stupid?

1169
01:18:46.573 --> 01:18:49.823
You're a worthless jerk, you know that?

1170
01:19:00.814 --> 01:19:03.647
(hard rock music)

1171
01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:24.056
(phone ringing)

1172
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:26.413
Yeah.

1173
01:19:26.455 --> 01:19:27.455
(tense music)

1174
01:19:27.490 --> 01:19:28.490
Where?

1175
01:19:29.859 --> 01:19:30.859
Why Now?

1176
01:19:31.993 --> 01:19:34.993
(crickets chirping)

1177
01:20:08.710 --> 01:20:10.824
[Doyle] Mitch, I know
this is probably hard


1178
01:20:10.867 --> 01:20:11.728
for you to believe,

1179
01:20:11.770 --> 01:20:13.870
but I think of you
as my only true friend.

1180
01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:16.020
That's why I hate myself so much

1181
01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:17.660
for dragging you into this mess.

1182
01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:20.529
You're too good of
a guy to deserve it.

1183
01:20:21.609 --> 01:20:23.233
I look up to you, Mitch.

1184
01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:25.678
I've hurt a lot of people really bad,

1185
01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:29.967
and I should have gotten
help a long time ago.


1186
01:20:30.010 --> 01:20:31.513
I've lost everything.

1187
01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:34.930
I don't even want my kids
to be associated with me.


1188
01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:37.453
They deserve much better.

1189
01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:42.103
I hope my wife
will remarry a good man,

1190
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.353
a family man like you.

1191
01:20:46.252 --> 01:20:49.273
I hope you understand that
this was my only choice.


1192
01:20:50.770 --> 01:20:52.453
You're friend, Alex.

1193
01:20:53.652 --> 01:20:54.508
(punches car roof)

1194
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:57.400
P.S. I hope the money has
helped take care of that girl.


1195
01:20:59.302 --> 01:21:01.969
(Mitch moaning)

1196
01:21:09.908 --> 01:21:12.658
(Mitch growling)

1197
01:21:14.169 --> 01:21:16.919
(dramatic music)

1198
01:21:36.342 --> 01:21:39.009
(Mitch sobbing)

1199
01:21:42.364 --> 01:21:44.947
(Mitch shouts)

1200
01:22:10.574 --> 01:22:13.324
(truck rumbling)

1201
01:22:18.447 --> 01:22:20.947
(tense music)

1202
01:22:26.978 --> 01:22:30.811
(crowd cheering and clapping)

1203
01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:50.728
Where do you think you're going, moron?

1204
01:22:50.770 --> 01:22:51.770
Stealing home.

1205
01:22:53.230 --> 01:22:55.913
[Opponent] Whatever. 
It's your funeral.

1206
01:22:55.956 --> 01:22:58.456
(tense music)

1207
01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:00.320
Back!

1208
01:23:03.784 --> 01:23:06.284
(tense music)

1209
01:23:12.010 --> 01:23:13.377
Mitch, not too far. Not too far.

1210
01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:14.470
Take a step back now.

1211
01:23:26.916 --> 01:23:30.666
(players and crowd cheering)

1212
01:23:37.819 --> 01:23:40.402
(helmet thuds)

1213
01:23:42.778 --> 01:23:43.569
Out!

1214
01:23:43.611 --> 01:23:46.754
(crowd groans)

1215
01:23:46.796 --> 01:23:49.379
(gloomy music)

1216
01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:57.988
I tried my best.

1217
01:23:58.029 --> 01:23:59.654
Not good enough!

1218
01:23:59.696 --> 01:24:00.946
Get up! Get up!

1219
01:24:03.277 --> 01:24:04.277
Worthless!

1220
01:24:05.824 --> 01:24:06.824
Worthless!

1221
01:24:12.801 --> 01:24:15.634
(engine rumbling)

1222
01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:23.556
(door closes)

1223
01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:44.907
(manager sighs)

1224
01:24:48.335 --> 01:24:51.085
(paper rustling)

1225
01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:15.140
Jennings.

1226
01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:24.973
I completely understand.

1227
01:25:27.013 --> 01:25:29.596
(Mitch sniffs)

1228
01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:32.410
You shouldn't even be here right now.

1229
01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:34.340
I should be alone.

1230
01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:38.657
I'm sorry I called you.

1231
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:42.857
I admire you.

1232
01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:48.148
You have no idea
how many players I've had,

1233
01:25:48.190 --> 01:25:50.248
that I've seen in my day,

1234
01:25:50.290 --> 01:25:53.608
average, horrible, not so good,

1235
01:25:53.650 --> 01:25:56.550
great ones that thought they
were great for the most part.


1236
01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:00.988
You know, and then
there's you, who show up.


1237
01:26:01.029 --> 01:26:03.013
You have been showing up every day,

1238
01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:05.353
being great at what you do.

1239
01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:07.910
I mean, what more can I ask for?

1240
01:26:10.990 --> 01:26:12.340
A lotta good that's done.

1241
01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.842
You gifted, Mitch. 
You're gifted.

1242
01:26:19.090 --> 01:26:22.678
Yeah, gifted.

1243
01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:27.720
Small town, independent baseball.

1244
01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:31.453
Yeah, I'm gifted all right.

1245
01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:33.943
I'm not talking baseball.

1246
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:39.627
I am so honored
that you thought of me

1247
01:26:39.670 --> 01:26:41.922
to call me to
talk to me about this.

1248
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:51.088
Doyle chose you. 
He called you.

1249
01:26:51.130 --> 01:26:54.268
He left that note
for you, not for me.

1250
01:26:54.310 --> 01:26:55.710
Do you know why he did that?

1251
01:26:57.460 --> 01:26:58.810
You're important to people.

1252
01:27:05.624 --> 01:27:07.345
(Mitch exhales sharply)

1253
01:27:07.386 --> 01:27:08.720
I am a nobody.

1254
01:27:10.117 --> 01:27:11.563
And I'm nobody's hero.

1255
01:27:14.949 --> 01:27:17.983
You don't have to be. That's
not what's expected of you.


1256
01:27:20.036 --> 01:27:21.717
(gentle music)

1257
01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:25.213
I need to see you there
tonight, 5:30 p.m. sharp.


1258
01:27:28.570 --> 01:27:33.034
Yeah, I'll be there.

1259
01:27:33.076 --> 01:27:35.909
(emotional music)

1260
01:27:54.403 --> 01:27:57.153
(letter tearing)

1261
01:28:24.925 --> 01:28:27.592
(bag unzipping)

1262
01:28:40.438 --> 01:28:43.438
(door bells jangle)

1263
01:28:44.770 --> 01:28:46.348
David.

1264
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:47.390
David!

1265
01:28:49.734 --> 01:28:52.498
(Mitch sighs)

1266
01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:54.988
Listen, I need you
to do me a favor.

1267
01:28:55.029 --> 01:28:56.877
Call the number on the
back of this envelope


1268
01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:59.458
at 7:00 p.m., no earlier.

1269
01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.903
After you make the call, open the envelope.

1270
01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:06.178
It's important.

1271
01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:07.220
Here.

1272
01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:11.313
This should make it worth your while.

1273
01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:14.510
Thank you.

1274
01:29:16.573 --> 01:29:19.779
(door bells jangle)

1275
01:29:19.822 --> 01:29:22.404
(moving music)

1276
01:30:18.315 --> 01:30:20.197
(dog barking)

1277
01:30:20.239 --> 01:30:23.072
(banging on door)

1278
01:30:24.538 --> 01:30:25.815
(banging on door)

1279
01:30:25.858 --> 01:30:28.212
What do you want?

1280
01:30:28.254 --> 01:30:30.671
(door opens)

1281
01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:32.840
Go away.

1282
01:30:33.730 --> 01:30:36.538
I just wanted to tell you
personally that it's over.


1283
01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:37.996
Not that I care, but
what's over, Jennings,


1284
01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:40.258
your baseball career, your life?

1285
01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:41.300
I said go away.

1286
01:30:43.543 --> 01:30:46.037
(door closes and opens)

1287
01:30:46.079 --> 01:30:48.356
You know, I called
in a favor for you,

1288
01:30:48.398 --> 01:30:50.338
hot you a cushy coaching job,

1289
01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:51.778
because I just had this feeling

1290
01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:53.463
like you were gonna be a problem.

1291
01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:57.583
You know, those girls,
they don't deserve to suffer,


1292
01:30:58.510 --> 01:30:59.810
and you will go to prison.

1293
01:31:03.250 --> 01:31:04.888
I'll take you there
myself if I have to.

1294
01:31:04.930 --> 01:31:05.980
You threatening me?

1295
01:31:06.850 --> 01:31:08.083
Seriously, old man?

1296
01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:12.140
You're so full of crap. I can
smell it on you, Jennings.


1297
01:31:13.810 --> 01:31:16.558
What happened to you
being the big hero, huh?


1298
01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:19.045
Buying the girl, setting her
free, what happened to that?


1299
01:31:19.087 --> 01:31:20.547
(Mitch sighs)

1300
01:31:20.590 --> 01:31:23.038
Oh, okay. (chuckles)

1301
01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:24.580
You've got a cashflow problem.

1302
01:31:26.109 --> 01:31:27.629
Big hero couldn't come with the money.

1303
01:31:27.670 --> 01:31:29.416
You know, Doyle killed
himself last night.


1304
01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:30.898
Huh.

1305
01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:33.178
Well, wuss had no stones,
so it doesn't surprise me.


1306
01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:35.103
So this is how
you wanna play it, huh?

1307
01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.160
Leave.

1308
01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:42.580
It's your funeral!

1309
01:31:42.622 --> 01:31:44.513
Yeah.

1310
01:31:44.555 --> 01:31:45.346
(door slams)

1311
01:31:45.388 --> 01:31:48.138
(dramatic music)

1312
01:32:13.690 --> 01:32:14.690
Hey.

1313
01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:19.910
Can you help me?

1314
01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:24.283
I'm looking for some young girls.

1315
01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:29.158
Yeah, I bet.

1316
01:32:29.199 --> 01:32:30.350
It's really just one.

1317
01:32:32.410 --> 01:32:33.859
I just need to know if you...

1318
01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:39.136
I'm saying I just really need to know

1319
01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.008
if you've seen her around here today.

1320
01:32:41.050 --> 01:32:42.028
(cart rattling)

1321
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:43.070
Come on.

1322
01:32:48.699 --> 01:32:50.893
Can't you help me? Please?

1323
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:54.030
You look like the kind of person

1324
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:57.118
that sees everything
that goes on around here.


1325
01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:58.160
Am I right?

1326
01:33:01.570 --> 01:33:02.570
Her.

1327
01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:04.258
This girl right there.

1328
01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:07.123
I can help her if
I get to her in time.

1329
01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:12.523
I just wanna help her, that's all.

1330
01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:17.877
(Mitch sighs)

1331
01:33:17.919 --> 01:33:18.919
I'm sorry.

1332
01:33:21.473 --> 01:33:23.422
I saw her here
a couple of hours ago.

1333
01:33:26.230 --> 01:33:29.983
Big guy in a red truck
took her and turned left.


1334
01:33:31.690 --> 01:33:34.078
Only one other motel that
they work the girls out of


1335
01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:35.120
in that direction.

1336
01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:37.293
Sunrise.

1337
01:33:37.335 --> 01:33:39.627
(dramatic music)

1338
01:33:39.670 --> 01:33:40.918
Yeah.

1339
01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:41.960
Thanks.

1340
01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:44.660
Hey.

1341
01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:48.313
If you really wanna help these girls,

1342
01:33:49.150 --> 01:33:51.823
then get rid of everything
that creates the demand.


1343
01:33:55.713 --> 01:33:56.880
Good day, sir.

1344
01:33:57.913 --> 01:34:00.663
(dramatic music)

1345
01:34:39.238 --> 01:34:41.654
(door opens)

1346
01:34:44.465 --> 01:34:47.215
(truck rumbling)

1347
01:34:59.499 --> 01:35:00.595
(door rattling)

1348
01:35:00.636 --> 01:35:01.636
Come on!

1349
01:35:09.372 --> 01:35:11.788
(door opens)

1350
01:35:13.857 --> 01:35:15.975
(banging on door)

1351
01:35:16.018 --> 01:35:16.809
(door opens)

1352
01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:18.463
Sammy, get your things! Let's go!

1353
01:35:19.311 --> 01:35:22.061
(dramatic music)

1354
01:35:26.114 --> 01:35:27.364
You need Jesus.

1355
01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:31.603
I need to apologize.

1356
01:35:33.243 --> 01:35:35.368
[Sammy] Thank you!

1357
01:35:35.410 --> 01:35:36.958
You're welcome, kid.

1358
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.793
Now listen. I'm getting you to Chicago.

1359
01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:42.658
You sure you can find your mom?

1360
01:35:42.699 --> 01:35:44.062
I'm sure.

1361
01:35:44.104 --> 01:35:45.943
Okay. Well this'll help.

1362
01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:50.908
Somebody gave it to me,

1363
01:35:50.949 --> 01:35:53.143
and I wanted to make
sure that you got it.

1364
01:35:57.310 --> 01:35:58.760
Tell them thank you for me.

1365
01:36:01.650 --> 01:36:02.668
(Mitch sighs)

1366
01:36:02.710 --> 01:36:04.581
Let's get you to that bus station.

1367
01:36:04.623 --> 01:36:06.478
(engine sputters)

1368
01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:08.019
Come on!

1369
01:36:08.061 --> 01:36:11.511
(engine sputters)

1370
01:36:11.553 --> 01:36:13.007
(Mitch sighs)

1371
01:36:13.049 --> 01:36:14.049
Not again.

1372
01:36:24.426 --> 01:36:25.973
(engine rumbling)

1373
01:36:26.015 --> 01:36:28.348
Mitch, is everything okay?

1374
01:36:30.267 --> 01:36:31.058
No! No, please!

1375
01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:32.245
No, no, no! Mitch!

1376
01:36:32.287 --> 01:36:33.078
(Sammy screams)

1377
01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:33.911
- Samantha!
- Please!


1378
01:36:33.953 --> 01:36:34.796
[Mitch] Samantha!

1379
01:36:34.838 --> 01:36:36.743
(truck leaves)

1380
01:36:36.785 --> 01:36:38.308

(Samantha screams)

1383
01:36:40.556 --> 01:36:42.054
I said shut up!

1384
01:36:42.096 --> 01:36:43.644
I hate you! I hate you!

1385
01:36:43.686 --> 01:36:44.984
Let me go!

1386
01:36:45.027 --> 01:36:46.027
Let me go!

1387
01:36:47.063 --> 01:36:47.854
[Driver] I said shut up!

1388
01:36:47.895 --> 01:36:49.852
(Sammy panting)

1389

(gun cocks)

1394
01:37:29.876 --> 01:37:31.375
[Sammy] No, no, no, no, no. (screams)

1395
01:37:31.399 --> 01:37:32.288
(grate rattling)

1396
01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:33.330
No!

1397
01:37:34.949 --> 01:37:36.236
[Driver] Stop! Relax.

1398
01:37:36.278 --> 01:37:37.197
Hey. Shut up!

1399
01:37:37.239 --> 01:37:38.767
Relax. Relax.

Mitch.

1406
01:38:03.448 --> 01:38:04.611
Mitch!

1407
01:38:04.653 --> 01:38:06.162
(tires squeal)

1408
01:38:06.204 --> 01:38:09.204
(suspenseful music)

1409
01:38:15.168 --> 01:38:16.046
Sammy!

1410

Sammy!

1427
01:39:21.788 --> 01:39:22.788
Sammy!

1428

(melancholy music)

1429
01:39:57.678 --> 01:39:58.909
[Joe] Come on, kid.

1430
01:39:58.951 --> 01:40:01.608
Go get 'em, baby. You got this.

1431
01:40:01.650 --> 01:40:04.402
(clapping)

1432
01:40:04.444 --> 01:40:06.861
Come on, kid. Come on, baby.

1433
01:40:11.694 --> 01:40:13.194
Put me in, skip.

1434
01:40:14.650 --> 01:40:15.650
You're late.

1435
01:40:16.630 --> 01:40:17.630
I know.

1436
01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:24.373
Okay, so if you know you're
late, go sit on the bench.


1437
01:40:25.210 --> 01:40:27.703
Come on, skip. You
gotta give me a chance.


1438
01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:31.888
You need to talk, you
know where to find me.


1439
01:40:31.930 --> 01:40:33.180
I'm always there for you.

1440
01:40:36.370 --> 01:40:37.502
Go warm that bench.

(bell jingling)

1445
01:41:00.871 --> 01:41:02.125

(players chattering and cheering)

1448
01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:48.690
Whoa.

1449
01:41:48.733 --> 01:41:49.524
No. No, no, no.

1450
01:41:49.565 --> 01:41:51.118
No, no, no, no. Come on, man!

1451

(handcuffs rattling)

1453
01:41:54.094 --> 01:41:55.528
Dead, Jennings.

1454
01:41:55.570 --> 01:41:56.788
Dead.

1455
01:41:56.830 --> 01:41:58.193
Get off of me!

1456
01:41:58.234 --> 01:42:00.234
What are you looking at?

1457
01:42:06.817 --> 01:42:08.930
[Joe] All right, nothing to see here.

1458
01:42:08.972 --> 01:42:11.043
I just thought maybe
you'd want this back.


1459
01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:14.511
Wait, how did you know-

1460
01:42:14.553 --> 01:42:16.978
- 'Cause only an idiot cheats on,

1461
01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:19.620
commits multiple felonies
using his own credit card.


1462
01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:25.169
Thank you.

1463
01:42:25.211 --> 01:42:28.044
(emotional music)

(announcement on intercom)

1465
01:43:09.167 --> 01:43:10.167
Miss?

1466
01:43:17.145 --> 01:43:18.479
Watch your step.

1467
01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:22.393
Hey, Jennings, you're up.

1468
01:43:25.104 --> 01:43:27.937

(Mitch sighs)

1470
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:43.230
I know this is a bad time,

1471
01:43:45.250 --> 01:43:47.100
but can you play someone else for me?

1472
01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:50.600
Let's just say that

1473
01:43:52.359 --> 01:43:55.092
this is my last game ever.

1474
01:43:57.491 --> 01:43:59.991
(Mitch sighs)

1475
01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:02.480
There are some

1476
01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:05.810
more important things

1477
01:44:07.634 --> 01:44:08.833
that I need to focus on.

1478
01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:13.940
I got you.

1479
01:44:21.433 --> 01:44:24.733
Purefeldman, you're up,

1480
01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:34.573
(emotional music)

1481

(travelers chattering)

1488
01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:46.207
Daddy, I miss you.

1489
01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:51.270
I miss you. Hey, we
get to hang out today.


1490
01:46:51.313 --> 01:46:52.313
Can Evan come?

1491
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:55.303
Yeah, Evan can come too.

1492
01:46:57.220 --> 01:46:59.038
Hey, why don't you get your toys

1493
01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:00.916
and go over there and play
for a little bit, okay?


1494
01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:02.008
Okay, Daddy.

1495
01:47:02.050 --> 01:47:03.050
All right.

1496
01:47:12.310 --> 01:47:14.613
Thanks for letting me hang
out with the kids today.


1497
01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:23.900
You look great.

1498
01:47:28.828 --> 01:47:29.828
I miss you.

1499
01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:36.870
School going good for Alyssa?

1500
01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:39.340
Yeah.

1501
01:47:39.382 --> 01:47:42.215
