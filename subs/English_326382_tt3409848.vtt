1
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.028
<i>Ñandú</i>means...
- Spider.


2
00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:17.572
And <i>káva</i>means... wasp.

3
00:04:16.404 --> 00:04:18.028
Voyeur!

4
00:04:21.904 --> 00:04:23.528
Voyeur!

5
00:04:34.904 --> 00:04:36.112
Malemba,

6
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.152
who's the voyeur?

7
00:04:40.904 --> 00:04:42.280
Voyeur!

8
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.652
We need the boy to confess.

9
00:05:37.196 --> 00:05:40.696
And that you find a way
to dismiss all the charges.


10
00:05:42.572 --> 00:05:44.572
He's not talking.

11
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.860
To free oneself of one's position,
one must first take care of it.


12
00:05:55.236 --> 00:05:57.696
I say this for
you and everyone else here.

13
00:05:59.696 --> 00:06:01.280
He won't talk.

14
00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:04.360
May I?
- Please.


15
00:06:09.444 --> 00:06:10.572
Good morning.

16
00:06:11.152 --> 00:06:13.860
Ventura Prieto, assistant to the magistrate.

17
00:06:22.152 --> 00:06:23.488
You can go.

18
00:06:24.404 --> 00:06:26.236
There will be no punishment.

19
00:06:34.904 --> 00:06:36.736
No punishment.

20
00:06:37.528 --> 00:06:38.736
You can go.

21
00:06:40.696 --> 00:06:42.944
Not without a statement.

22
00:06:54.444 --> 00:06:55.904
Guard,

23
00:06:56.528 --> 00:06:58.988
show this good man the way out.

24
00:07:25.944 --> 00:07:27.860
There's a fish...

25
00:07:37.444 --> 00:07:38.820
There's... a fish...

26
00:07:38.944 --> 00:07:40.988
You're still under oath.

27
00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:44.944
There's a fish

28
00:07:45.612 --> 00:07:47.488
that spends its life

29
00:07:47.944 --> 00:07:49.488
swimming to and fro.

30
00:07:51.152 --> 00:07:54.444
Fighting water
that seeks to cast it upon dry land.


31
00:07:56.988 --> 00:07:58.944
Because the water rejects it.

32
00:08:01.072 --> 00:08:03.152
The water doesn't want it.

33
00:08:12.112 --> 00:08:14.652
<i>These long-suffering fish,</i>

34
00:08:15.736 --> 00:08:18.820
<i>so attached to the element that repels them,</i>

35
00:08:19.612 --> 00:08:21.988
<i>devote all their energies</i>

36
00:08:22.572 --> 00:08:25.072
<i>to remaining in place.</i>

37
00:08:28.528 --> 00:08:31.944
<i>You'll never find them</i>
<i>in the central part of the river,</i>


38
00:08:33.236 --> 00:08:34.572
<i>but always near the banks.</i>

39
00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:51.280
Fernández.

40
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.988
"My lady, my Marta,

41
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.236
I write to you with concern.

42
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.404
For 14 months,
I've waited for news of you and my children."


43
00:09:09.652 --> 00:09:11.780
The Governor told me

44
00:09:12.944 --> 00:09:15.780
it won't be long before my departure.

45
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.696
The Governor assured me

46
00:09:22.196 --> 00:09:25.152
it won't be long before my departure.

47
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.196
What do you want?

48
00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.988
Message for Diego de Zama.
- That's me.


49
00:09:34.988 --> 00:09:37.736
They're expecting you at Getaway Beach.

50
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.988
Who's expecting me?
- A man.


51
00:10:11.612 --> 00:10:14.320
I need you to
speak to the Minister, Diego.

52
00:10:15.152 --> 00:10:18.152
I don't want those leeches embarking my ship.

53
00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:22.652
Your relationship with the Treasury Minister
is good?


54
00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.944
Everyone here is willing to do business,
Indalecio.


55
00:10:26.072 --> 00:10:28.280
No payments for over a year.

56
00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:31.904
We have to unload the Oriental's brandy.

57
00:10:33.072 --> 00:10:35.196
He's made a fortune in Montevideo.

58
00:10:35.904 --> 00:10:38.860
Now he wants to expand his business upriver.

59
00:10:40.736 --> 00:10:43.780
Did Marta give you a letter for me?

60
00:10:46.028 --> 00:10:48.696
Marta is making many sacrifices, Diego.

61
00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.612
Taking care of your children.

62
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.360
They're growing.

63
00:11:01.236 --> 00:11:03.320
Did you see her... often?

64
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.196
My friend, the Oriental!

65
00:11:09.904 --> 00:11:12.780
A man who has
seen the future from Montevideo!

66
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.320
I'm grateful that you're willing to help us,
don Diego.


67
00:11:29.112 --> 00:11:31.612
If you excuse me, 
I'll now retire to rest.

68
00:11:37.152 --> 00:11:39.612
Do we need an armed escort?

69
00:11:41.612 --> 00:11:44.944
They warned us about a "Vicuña."
- Vicuña is dead!


70
00:11:45.072 --> 00:11:46.944
He was killed 1000 times.

71
00:11:47.072 --> 00:11:49.944
Don't worry. You're in good hands now.

72
00:11:50.072 --> 00:11:51.404
Go and rest.

73
00:11:54.196 --> 00:11:55.944
The Oriental's son.

74
00:11:57.904 --> 00:12:01.112
During the voyage,
I told him who don Diego de Zama was.


75
00:12:02.988 --> 00:12:05.572
The magistrate don Diego de Zama.

76
00:12:11.528 --> 00:12:13.696
A god who was born old

77
00:12:14.236 --> 00:12:15.820
and can't die.

78
00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:18.072
His loneliness is atrocious.

79
00:12:22.652 --> 00:12:24.152
Are you talking to me?

80
00:12:38.028 --> 00:12:40.072
Don Diego de Zama,

81
00:12:42.028 --> 00:12:43.612
vigorous,

82
00:12:43.736 --> 00:12:45.320
in charge.

83
00:12:47.528 --> 00:12:52.360
The pacifier of Indians.
He who did justice without drawing his sword.


84
00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:03.988
It's not Zama who hides behind obligations
without surprises or risks.


85
00:13:06.028 --> 00:13:10.572
Zama the <i>corregidor</i>.
A <i>corregidor</i>with the spirit of justice.


86
00:13:19.404 --> 00:13:20.944
A man of law.

87
00:13:21.444 --> 00:13:22.736
A judge.

88
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.696
A man without fear.

89
00:13:36.988 --> 00:13:38.988
Good evening.

90
00:13:45.944 --> 00:13:47.572
Your shirt?

91
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.196
There's no one, don Diego.

92
00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.072
Rita.

93
00:14:16.736 --> 00:14:18.236
Are you hurt?

94
00:15:01.988 --> 00:15:04.152
There's nothing to fear.

95
00:15:11.404 --> 00:15:13.280
Who goes there?

96
00:15:32.652 --> 00:15:33.988
What's happening?

97
00:15:37.028 --> 00:15:39.152
Did they rob you, don Diego?

98
00:15:40.736 --> 00:15:44.152
Was there a robbery?
- No, I arrived just in time.


99
00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.488
It's the dead boy.

100
00:15:53.488 --> 00:15:55.196
Was it a fair-skinned boy?

101
00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.236
No. Maybe. I was here.

102
00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.236
Diego...

103
00:16:06.944 --> 00:16:08.736
I fear for my daughters.

104
00:16:10.528 --> 00:16:12.280
They're my treasure,

105
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.652
magnificent women.

106
00:16:16.236 --> 00:16:20.488
Every night since my wife died,
I brush their hair.


107
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.444
I fear for them.

108
00:16:24.652 --> 00:16:26.280
Sometimes, I get up.

109
00:16:26.404 --> 00:16:28.152
I go to their rooms,

110
00:16:28.652 --> 00:16:31.612
I fix the mosquito nets, 
I close the windows...

111
00:16:32.196 --> 00:16:34.780
Vicuña and his men break into houses

112
00:16:36.112 --> 00:16:38.528
and pass their days raping women.

113
00:16:38.528 --> 00:16:40.528
He will return tomorrow...

114
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.280
Diego,

115
00:16:43.112 --> 00:16:45.280
I fear for my daughters.

116
00:16:47.152 --> 00:16:50.152
Vicuña and his men break into houses

117
00:16:51.152 --> 00:16:53.736
and spend days raping women.

118
00:16:55.528 --> 00:16:57.612
Vicuña has been executed.

119
00:16:57.736 --> 00:16:59.612
There's nothing to fear.

120
00:17:06.904 --> 00:17:09.404
He said he will return tomorrow night.

121
00:17:32.652 --> 00:17:34.612
Don Diego de Zama!

122
00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.072
Sit here.

123
00:17:54.696 --> 00:17:56.696
Don Ventura Prieto!

124
00:18:03.028 --> 00:18:04.572
Ladies...

125
00:18:17.988 --> 00:18:21.196
Doña Luciana Piñares de Luenga!

126
00:18:25.196 --> 00:18:27.696
Help me with this, it's poorly fitted.

127
00:18:28.404 --> 00:18:29.988
It's tight here.

128
00:18:42.988 --> 00:18:45.196
Good afternoon.

129
00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:08.553
The mulattas are here.

130
00:19:18.013 --> 00:19:20.177
Won't you help yourself, don Diego?

131
00:19:21.553 --> 00:19:22.553
No.

132
00:19:23.513 --> 00:19:25.261
You prefer white girls.

133
00:19:29.345 --> 00:19:30.597
Yes.

134
00:19:31.177 --> 00:19:34.761
You amaze me with such an exclusive preference.

135
00:19:40.261 --> 00:19:42.177
Were you robbed at the inn?

136
00:19:42.929 --> 00:19:44.513
Did they rob you?

137
00:19:44.637 --> 00:19:47.345
Did they?
- No, I intervened.


138
00:19:47.469 --> 00:19:49.013
Who was it?
- I don't know.


139
00:19:49.137 --> 00:19:52.385
Seems there was a scuffle
in your room last night?

140
00:19:53.013 --> 00:19:54.969
Did they hurt you?

141
00:19:56.097 --> 00:20:00.761
Your landlord's daughter was at the market.
She was very nervous about Vicuña Porto.


142
00:20:00.969 --> 00:20:03.513
It appears Don Diego faced Vicuña!

143
00:20:10.721 --> 00:20:14.305
Your friend the Oriental,
he might have cholera.


144
00:20:14.761 --> 00:20:16.513
There've been other cases.

145
00:20:16.637 --> 00:20:20.013
Should I send for Doctor Palos?
- No, I'm already aware.


146
00:20:41.053 --> 00:20:45.429
To honor the visit of
Señora Luciana Piñares de Luenga,


147
00:20:46.097 --> 00:20:48.097
our beloved Luciana,

148
00:20:48.513 --> 00:20:51.137
she'll hand out the ribbons to the winner.

149
00:20:52.261 --> 00:20:56.261
Let's head to the gallery.
You can sit wherever you feel most at ease.


150
00:20:57.177 --> 00:21:02.721
In my case, I prefer the company of a man
who bears the white man's burden


151
00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:06.053
and is sanctified by purity.

152
00:21:07.805 --> 00:21:10.637
Luciana is the Treasury Minister's wife, right?

153
00:21:10.761 --> 00:21:11.761
Yes.

154
00:21:13.221 --> 00:21:16.177
A joke has been making the rounds.

155
00:21:17.761 --> 00:21:22.013
They say Luciana has the most beautiful body
that Zama has ever imagined.


156
00:21:22.845 --> 00:21:24.513
Who said that?

157
00:21:25.261 --> 00:21:26.761
Over there.

158
00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:29.761
The bald man.

159
00:21:32.637 --> 00:21:34.929
Maybe I should leave.

160
00:21:35.469 --> 00:21:37.137
I don't have the strength.

161
00:21:50.597 --> 00:21:52.137
Doctor Palos?

162
00:22:14.677 --> 00:22:17.053
Doctor Palos?
- It's the dead boy.


163
00:22:17.177 --> 00:22:19.553
The little saint is there.

164
00:23:13.013 --> 00:23:14.261
Palos?

165
00:23:41.885 --> 00:23:43.305
Who are you?

166
00:23:54.553 --> 00:23:59.929
I wish to speak with the Minister of the Treasury,
Señor Honorio Piñares de Luenga.


167
00:24:06.885 --> 00:24:09.513
My business can be postponed.

168
00:24:10.513 --> 00:24:13.761
I need to see a
doctor who honors that title.

169
00:24:22.053 --> 00:24:24.513
May I speak with someone in the house?

170
00:24:31.429 --> 00:24:34.761
And Señora Piñares de Luenga, is she in?

171
00:24:37.677 --> 00:24:40.261
Distilled in a double alambic.

172
00:24:40.969 --> 00:24:44.305
So it's distilled many times before it's ready.

173
00:24:45.677 --> 00:24:47.261
You'll appreciate it.

174
00:24:48.929 --> 00:24:51.885
These recipes are jealously guarded.

175
00:24:54.637 --> 00:24:56.929
Have you been to Buenos Aires?
- Yes.


176
00:24:57.053 --> 00:25:01.137
I read that many comedy troupes
put on plays with their orchestras.


177
00:25:01.429 --> 00:25:03.929
We have almost no occasion for elegance here.

178
00:25:04.429 --> 00:25:06.637
That's not something you lack.

179
00:25:07.469 --> 00:25:09.221
My wife wanted to go.

180
00:25:17.721 --> 00:25:19.553
My wife wanted to go.

181
00:25:22.345 --> 00:25:24.429
Me, I'm always on the river...

182
00:25:29.969 --> 00:25:31.929
that comes and goes...

183
00:25:35.097 --> 00:25:38.553
Always far away,
for one reason or another.


184
00:25:42.969 --> 00:25:45.097
It's aged in casks.

185
00:25:47.929 --> 00:25:49.469
Such nobility!

186
00:25:52.053 --> 00:25:53.513
See those?

187
00:25:53.805 --> 00:25:55.721
Bring me the little glasses.

188
00:25:55.845 --> 00:25:57.385
No, the smaller ones.

189
00:25:57.761 --> 00:25:59.305
How beautiful.

190
00:26:01.429 --> 00:26:04.053
There were twelve of them. 
Only eight arrived.

191
00:26:04.177 --> 00:26:07.805
They came in a box, well protected,
but not all of them wrapped.


192
00:26:07.929 --> 00:26:09.929
Such laziness, this packaging.

193
00:26:11.137 --> 00:26:14.221
They were wrapped in newspapers from Buenos Aires.

194
00:26:14.345 --> 00:26:17.137
And curiously enough, sent with that flotilla,

195
00:26:17.261 --> 00:26:23.221
were newspapers dated back further
than the newspapers wrapped around my glasses.


196
00:26:25.097 --> 00:26:30.053
My glasses carried more recent news
than the papers distributed here.


197
00:26:30.177 --> 00:26:31.805
Isn't that charming?

198
00:26:32.385 --> 00:26:33.929
And sad?

199
00:26:35.805 --> 00:26:40.969
It doesn't weigh on you, don Diego,
because you'll be transferred any day now, I hear.


200
00:26:43.305 --> 00:26:47.261
It doesn't weigh on you, don Diego,
because you'll be transferred any day now, I hear.


201
00:26:49.345 --> 00:26:52.053
Where are you hoping to be sent?

202
00:26:54.137 --> 00:26:56.053
To the city of Lerma.

203
00:26:57.013 --> 00:26:58.721
But not just yet.

204
00:27:00.845 --> 00:27:03.513
We have almost no occasion for elegance here.

205
00:27:05.013 --> 00:27:08.221
The newspapers spoke of the uproar caused by...

206
00:27:08.805 --> 00:27:10.513
I forget the play.

207
00:27:10.637 --> 00:27:12.261
The applause...

208
00:27:12.969 --> 00:27:15.429
How rare, the occasions for applause.

209
00:27:33.345 --> 00:27:36.013
To the actors who dare to disguise themselves!

210
00:28:13.429 --> 00:28:15.929
Our friend is not well.

211
00:28:23.221 --> 00:28:27.053
Should I send for Doctor Palos?
- No, I'm already aware.


212
00:28:27.805 --> 00:28:29.221
Diego...

213
00:28:29.969 --> 00:28:34.137
How timely it is for me to intercede
in favor of your friend's affairs.


214
00:28:35.721 --> 00:28:37.097
Luciana.

215
00:28:38.637 --> 00:28:40.053
Come in!

216
00:28:42.385 --> 00:28:43.929
Has he left?

217
00:28:44.053 --> 00:28:45.637
He felt indisposed.

218
00:28:45.761 --> 00:28:48.221
His poor manners are forgiven.

219
00:28:49.553 --> 00:28:52.385
You should send for Doctor Palos.
- Of course.


220
00:28:52.845 --> 00:28:55.969
As soon as your friend recovers,
come see me again, Diego.


221
00:28:57.597 --> 00:28:59.845
I'll do everything in my powers.

222
00:29:00.221 --> 00:29:02.305
I'll send a letter to my husband,

223
00:29:02.429 --> 00:29:04.677
informing him of our affairs.

224
00:29:08.805 --> 00:29:11.513
When he's away,
he torments me with tender missives.


225
00:29:12.013 --> 00:29:14.305
This servant here, this black,

226
00:29:14.429 --> 00:29:17.429
comes and goes with messages.
With this heat...


227
00:29:21.885 --> 00:29:23.345
Señora,

228
00:29:24.137 --> 00:29:26.345
it grieves me to learn this.

229
00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:33.721
Many women despise my independence.

230
00:29:34.305 --> 00:29:37.097
And too many men misunderstand my conduct.

231
00:29:37.513 --> 00:29:39.305
Small-minded people.

232
00:29:41.177 --> 00:29:42.637
Yet abundant.

233
00:29:50.221 --> 00:29:53.097
People are less alone

234
00:29:53.553 --> 00:29:57.721
in the big cities,
while knowing each other less, don't you think?


235
00:30:01.761 --> 00:30:04.805
Is this summer worse, or
am I just more impatient?

236
00:30:04.929 --> 00:30:06.805
Houses suffocate me.

237
00:30:08.177 --> 00:30:09.721
I prefer the river.

238
00:30:17.305 --> 00:30:19.845
If only we had some cold months.

239
00:30:19.969 --> 00:30:23.305
Yes, time doesn't pass when there's no winter.

240
00:30:25.385 --> 00:30:27.013
The snow...

241
00:30:28.385 --> 00:30:30.013
So elegant.

242
00:30:31.053 --> 00:30:34.177
The Russian princesses wrapped in furs.

243
00:30:37.177 --> 00:30:38.513
The perfumes.

244
00:30:39.429 --> 00:30:42.097
The heated houses, with rugs.

245
00:30:43.969 --> 00:30:46.969
Europe is best remembered
by those who were never there.


246
00:30:47.885 --> 00:30:49.677
I recall nothing about it.

247
00:30:50.053 --> 00:30:52.553
Marriage forces you to forget.

248
00:30:52.677 --> 00:30:54.305
Or so I've been told.

249
00:31:12.013 --> 00:31:14.177
Diego, let's not be reckless.

250
00:31:42.929 --> 00:31:46.845
The Governor has sent me to assist you.
- What's this circus?


251
00:31:46.969 --> 00:31:49.385
These people have friends in high places.

252
00:31:50.513 --> 00:31:53.637
The Governor wants to hold onto his position.
- My position?


253
00:31:54.097 --> 00:31:56.221
Yes. Yours, too.

254
00:32:05.885 --> 00:32:09.761
The Administration's Magistrate,
Diego de Zama.


255
00:32:10.305 --> 00:32:13.513
Ventura Prieto, 
Assistant Magistrate.

256
00:32:18.261 --> 00:32:21.637
We are old settlers of Concepción.

257
00:32:22.929 --> 00:32:25.469
Descendants of the first-comers.

258
00:32:26.305 --> 00:32:29.345
Our father is a direct, blood descendant

259
00:32:29.469 --> 00:32:32.305
of don Domingo Martínez de Irala.

260
00:32:33.261 --> 00:32:36.805
We chased the Indians from these lands.

261
00:32:39.097 --> 00:32:42.761
But they came back with claims.

262
00:32:43.969 --> 00:32:46.553
We chased them out again,

263
00:32:47.429 --> 00:32:49.013
and so on.

264
00:32:50.137 --> 00:32:52.345
They fled into the jungle.

265
00:32:53.677 --> 00:32:55.721
We went looking for them,

266
00:32:57.261 --> 00:32:59.721
and showed no mercy.

267
00:33:01.345 --> 00:33:05.513
None were spared.
And now there's no one left to work.


268
00:33:06.969 --> 00:33:08.761
I only have my granddaughter.

269
00:33:10.761 --> 00:33:12.761
She has mixed blood.

270
00:33:14.929 --> 00:33:16.845
She was held captive.

271
00:33:20.097 --> 00:33:22.345
We managed to get her back.

272
00:33:25.345 --> 00:33:28.761
It's our right to claim an<i>encomienda</i>.

273
00:33:29.845 --> 00:33:32.177
Forty tame Indians.

274
00:33:38.053 --> 00:33:40.053
A concession of Indians?

275
00:33:46.053 --> 00:33:48.013
You shall have enough Indians.

276
00:33:49.385 --> 00:33:51.097
You may return in peace.

277
00:33:51.597 --> 00:33:55.845
You have the Governor's word:
His Majesty will receive your request.


278
00:34:27.761 --> 00:34:30.885
They don't have title deeds or documents.
We have nothing.


279
00:34:31.013 --> 00:34:35.345
Find a way to retrieve them.
This noble family has suffered enough.


280
00:34:35.805 --> 00:34:38.677
The name of Irala
isn't enough to enslave natives.

281
00:34:41.677 --> 00:34:43.429
What did you say, Ventura?

282
00:34:44.221 --> 00:34:48.513
Taking away freedom requires more
than a paper with Irala's name on it.


283
00:34:48.637 --> 00:34:51.385
You disapprove of my benevolence?

284
00:34:51.513 --> 00:34:55.137
What title do you deem valid
to obtain an <i>encomienda</i>of Indians?


285
00:34:56.385 --> 00:34:57.969
None.

286
00:34:59.845 --> 00:35:02.929
Am I talking to
a functionary of the Crown?

287
00:35:03.513 --> 00:35:04.969
You're talking to a man

288
00:35:05.097 --> 00:35:08.221
astonished by the number of Americans
who want to pass for Spaniards


289
00:35:08.345 --> 00:35:10.553
instead of being what they are.

290
00:35:14.013 --> 00:35:15.553
"A man, astonished by..."

291
00:35:26.261 --> 00:35:27.513
Such bravura!

292
00:35:27.637 --> 00:35:30.929
They say you almost captured Vicuña Porto!

293
00:36:20.444 --> 00:36:21.780
<i>Diego,</i>

294
00:36:22.696 --> 00:36:24.444
<i>what have they done to you?</i>

295
00:36:25.236 --> 00:36:26.736
<i>When will you return?</i>

296
00:36:27.488 --> 00:36:29.320
<i>Your children are growing.</i>

297
00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.572
They're growing tired.

298
00:36:33.488 --> 00:36:35.028
And so am I.

299
00:36:37.944 --> 00:36:40.320
I'll be there soon, Marta.

300
00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.988
A ship is coming.

301
00:36:45.988 --> 00:36:47.780
With Royal Mail.

302
00:36:49.196 --> 00:36:51.028
For overdue payments.

303
00:36:54.236 --> 00:36:56.404
We must be patient, Marta.

304
00:37:16.572 --> 00:37:18.236
Are you hurt?

305
00:37:19.572 --> 00:37:21.072
He humiliated me.

306
00:37:22.696 --> 00:37:24.196
He bit me.

307
00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:30.196
So many times.

308
00:37:32.988 --> 00:37:35.112
Have you avenged me, Diego?

309
00:37:39.904 --> 00:37:43.652
He forced me to submit to his desires.
He mocked me.


310
00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.612
You avenged me.

311
00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.528
Who did this, Rita?

312
00:37:52.988 --> 00:37:54.860
Officer Bermúdez.

313
00:37:56.696 --> 00:37:58.152
The bald one?

314
00:37:59.028 --> 00:38:02.028
He thought no one
would come to my defense.

315
00:38:03.444 --> 00:38:06.360
You, Zama, who have nothing.

316
00:38:08.196 --> 00:38:11.780
I won't let my father fight a duel.

317
00:38:13.488 --> 00:38:15.652
You have nothing to lose.

318
00:38:16.736 --> 00:38:18.360
You avenged me.

319
00:38:18.488 --> 00:38:19.820
And now...

320
00:38:21.072 --> 00:38:22.988
that scoundrel is dead.

321
00:38:24.736 --> 00:38:25.944
No.

322
00:38:27.736 --> 00:38:29.488
I didn't kill him.

323
00:38:31.112 --> 00:38:32.528
Who said that?

324
00:38:32.652 --> 00:38:34.696
Then you must avenge me.

325
00:38:35.988 --> 00:38:39.320
You're capable of killing,
you have nothing to lose.


326
00:38:39.944 --> 00:38:41.488
Yes, I do.

327
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.028
A wife.

328
00:38:45.112 --> 00:38:46.860
I have children, Rita.

329
00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:52.320
I'm the Crown's magistrate. 
A functionary.

330
00:38:55.028 --> 00:38:56.780
A monk has come.

331
00:38:57.736 --> 00:39:01.152
He said you should
pay for the funeral expenses.

332
00:39:06.112 --> 00:39:08.072
Who died, Rita?

333
00:39:31.612 --> 00:39:33.860
A part of the payment must be advanced.

334
00:39:33.988 --> 00:39:37.320
The rest can be paid
when the mourning period allows, of course.


335
00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:42.528
I was told the cargo of the deceased
is being held up at customs.


336
00:39:42.652 --> 00:39:44.528
Have they seized it?

337
00:39:48.696 --> 00:39:51.944
They released two casks to cover burial expenses.

338
00:39:52.528 --> 00:39:55.736
Brandy that we sell
at a very reasonable price.

339
00:39:56.072 --> 00:39:58.528
People grow tired of schnapps...

340
00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.360
The other casks were taken into custody.

341
00:40:04.612 --> 00:40:07.236
The customs officer informed me.

342
00:40:12.152 --> 00:40:14.528
Death imposes conditions on all of us.

343
00:40:14.944 --> 00:40:18.780
I'll offend his stature
if I conduct a ceremony for the poor.


344
00:40:18.904 --> 00:40:20.236
Where?

345
00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.196
Next to his father.

346
00:40:25.944 --> 00:40:31.444
The preparation of the bodies must be paid for
before their transfer to Montevideo.


347
00:40:34.152 --> 00:40:37.360
Until then, we'll have to
keep them in our crypt.

348
00:40:37.488 --> 00:40:39.236
It's cooler here.

349
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.820
We could also burn them.

350
00:40:46.488 --> 00:40:48.488
They died of the plague.

351
00:40:50.404 --> 00:40:52.736
Don't incur further expenses, Excellency.

352
00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:57.944
That needs to be discussed
with the Father Accountant in charge of accounts.


353
00:41:04.196 --> 00:41:06.696
I would like to shave.

354
00:41:30.528 --> 00:41:34.072
I didn't want you to hear
about the unfortunate event from anyone else.


355
00:41:34.196 --> 00:41:36.444
Our friend, the Oriental, is dead.

356
00:41:43.488 --> 00:41:45.360
I don't need air.

357
00:41:58.028 --> 00:41:59.944
Your friend wasn't well.

358
00:42:01.736 --> 00:42:03.404
A dead boy?

359
00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.988
The plague in the ships is relentless.

360
00:42:10.404 --> 00:42:11.988
How unfortunate.

361
00:42:12.612 --> 00:42:14.572
Malemba wants to get married.

362
00:42:14.696 --> 00:42:16.528
Who is Malemba?

363
00:42:17.196 --> 00:42:21.860
The funeral will keep us very busy these days.
We must prepare for the mourning.


364
00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.196
Let's drink in his honor.

365
00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.236
There won't be a wake.

366
00:42:27.112 --> 00:42:29.528
The Oriental was an austere man.

367
00:42:30.528 --> 00:42:33.944
The Bishop believes we
should adhere to his ways.

368
00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.488
Such austerity.

369
00:42:38.612 --> 00:42:40.072
What a pity.

370
00:42:40.444 --> 00:42:44.152
There will be no wake.
Only something modest and boring.


371
00:42:44.736 --> 00:42:47.196
How sad. What a shame.

372
00:42:48.652 --> 00:42:50.944
Who wants to get married?

373
00:42:51.652 --> 00:42:52.944
Malemba.

374
00:42:53.612 --> 00:42:56.652
She bought her freedom
and already wants to lose it.


375
00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.612
I told my husband:
she can't give her consent.

376
00:42:59.736 --> 00:43:01.860
Can a mute give her consent?

377
00:43:01.988 --> 00:43:03.236
No!

378
00:43:07.904 --> 00:43:10.196
The black came today with letters.

379
00:43:10.944 --> 00:43:13.444
All men covet my body.

380
00:43:13.944 --> 00:43:17.696
Honorio, my own husband, is fascinated by flesh.

381
00:43:18.944 --> 00:43:20.696
I despise him.

382
00:43:21.444 --> 00:43:24.780
And all men for their desire to possess.

383
00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.528
I'm grateful

384
00:43:29.652 --> 00:43:32.528
for having met a woman of your character.

385
00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.944
Malemba has suffered enough.

386
00:43:36.696 --> 00:43:40.404
She swam across the river,
fleeing an abusive tobacco farmer.


387
00:43:40.528 --> 00:43:43.112
She swam not only for hours. 
How long was it?

388
00:43:44.444 --> 00:43:45.736
How long?

389
00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:50.696
Days in the water, holding on to her life.
She was captured again in Chaco.


390
00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.612
They skinned her feet,

391
00:43:52.736 --> 00:43:55.444
and rubbed that horrible plant on her.

392
00:44:00.944 --> 00:44:02.696
On the soles of her feet.

393
00:44:08.528 --> 00:44:12.404
I thought her muteness and limping
were linked.


394
00:44:12.944 --> 00:44:14.572
She's not mute.

395
00:44:14.696 --> 00:44:16.360
She has her tongue.

396
00:44:24.736 --> 00:44:27.112
I want to settle this marriage affair.

397
00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:29.236
Malemba's.

398
00:44:33.528 --> 00:44:35.528
Nothing prevents it.

399
00:44:35.652 --> 00:44:38.820
Valid consent is given in written form.

400
00:44:38.944 --> 00:44:41.652
Your husband's signature will validate the union.

401
00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:43.904
Your mute can get married.

402
00:44:44.404 --> 00:44:45.944
You deserve a kiss.

403
00:44:50.572 --> 00:44:52.072
Not now.

404
00:45:19.152 --> 00:45:21.444
A message for Diego de Zama.

405
00:45:23.988 --> 00:45:25.652
It's me. Speak.

406
00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.112
The Governor says you must go.

407
00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:29.944
I must go?

408
00:45:30.072 --> 00:45:32.112
To his office.

409
00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.736
Mail has arrived.

410
00:45:58.196 --> 00:45:59.736
It's over!

411
00:46:15.236 --> 00:46:16.780
Governor?

412
00:46:26.696 --> 00:46:30.196
"Having requested observance
of this sovereign provision


413
00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.904
and given a hearing
to the Royal Accord on this case,


414
00:46:33.028 --> 00:46:36.112
I have resolved by this decree
of last November 27th,


415
00:46:36.236 --> 00:46:39.280
declaring as I declare, that blah, blah, blah..."

416
00:46:40.152 --> 00:46:42.236
I'm being transferred to Spain.

417
00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:46.444
Royal Mail?

418
00:46:47.444 --> 00:46:50.360
When did it arrive? 
Any news for me?

419
00:46:50.488 --> 00:46:52.404
No, not yet.

420
00:46:55.404 --> 00:46:59.944
I've been forced, due to your superior rank,
to deport Ventura Prieto.


421
00:47:05.236 --> 00:47:07.028
Deported for a brawl?

422
00:47:07.572 --> 00:47:09.196
It was just a brawl.

423
00:47:10.696 --> 00:47:15.072
A street brawl doesn't look good
for a functionary of your status.


424
00:47:16.988 --> 00:47:19.528
I didn't want to be excessively severe.

425
00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:23.360
I've written a recommendation letter
for Ventura Prieto.


426
00:47:24.112 --> 00:47:27.404
What's important is that
his reputation not be tainted.


427
00:47:27.528 --> 00:47:30.196
Ventura is a Spanish functionary.

428
00:47:32.904 --> 00:47:36.236
You can't afford such risks, Diego.

429
00:47:37.904 --> 00:47:39.988
You've chosen the city of Lerma.

430
00:47:40.112 --> 00:47:41.320
Yes.

431
00:47:41.444 --> 00:47:44.320
I've requested a transfer
to the city of Lerma.

432
00:47:45.488 --> 00:47:48.404
Ventura Prieto has chosen the city of Lerma.

433
00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.072
The deported...

434
00:47:57.488 --> 00:47:59.528
gets to choose his destination

435
00:47:59.944 --> 00:48:01.904
and gets a recommendation?

436
00:48:03.612 --> 00:48:06.236
Make a copy of the Crown's resolution.

437
00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.528
And announce my departure at once.

438
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.444
Malemba,

439
00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:13.072
tell your Señora I need to see her.

440
00:49:27.988 --> 00:49:30.988
Malemba, is someone at the door?

441
00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.652
Will you not announce me?

442
00:50:10.072 --> 00:50:14.820
Honorio had been asleep for a while
when suddenly I woke up startled and saw it,


443
00:50:14.944 --> 00:50:17.196
crawling up Honorio's neck.

444
00:50:17.736 --> 00:50:20.528
I couldn't move, cry or shout.

445
00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:24.280
What's here?

446
00:50:24.904 --> 00:50:26.652
It itches.

447
00:50:30.612 --> 00:50:34.736
At dawn, I saw it on the ground.
It was still moving, with grubs on its back.


448
00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:37.072
It was the spider wasp.

449
00:50:37.196 --> 00:50:39.696
It lays eggs inside living spiders.

450
00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:51.820
Help me with this.

451
00:50:58.196 --> 00:51:00.112
Malemba, is someone at the door?

452
00:51:27.196 --> 00:51:29.196
Curtains from Damascus.

453
00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:31.780
Missing.

454
00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.360
A table with ebony nailing.

455
00:51:36.236 --> 00:51:38.404
There was a painting on that wall.

456
00:51:39.904 --> 00:51:42.736
A portrait of Our Majesty, the King.

457
00:51:49.196 --> 00:51:52.404
The Governor was very fond
of that painting, too.


458
00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.572
The chairs with velvet upholstery?

459
00:51:58.444 --> 00:52:00.444
They were to his liking, too.

460
00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:05.072
He took the harnesses and 14 saddles.

461
00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.196
Should I record this?

462
00:52:49.152 --> 00:52:50.780
That's not him.

463
00:52:53.112 --> 00:52:54.488
It's that one.

464
00:53:07.444 --> 00:53:08.904
Can't he walk?

465
00:53:09.988 --> 00:53:11.488
Does he talk?

466
00:53:12.196 --> 00:53:14.028
A few words.

467
00:53:34.944 --> 00:53:38.444
"The sailor's wife gets rich,
when plenty are the fish!"


468
00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:49.152
Come, Zama. Pull up a chair.

469
00:53:50.488 --> 00:53:52.236
Today is a lucky day.

470
00:53:53.152 --> 00:53:55.236
Show him the ears.

471
00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.988
Tell him the story.

472
00:54:03.612 --> 00:54:06.112
The ears of Vicuña Porto,

473
00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:09.152
cut off before his execution.

474
00:54:10.612 --> 00:54:12.572
The cruelty of men...

475
00:54:13.944 --> 00:54:15.780
This is what's at stake.

476
00:54:16.652 --> 00:54:17.944
Slowly.

477
00:54:23.736 --> 00:54:26.236
Governor, I've brought you a scribe.

478
00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:29.280
If this game will last for long, 
I can excuse him.

479
00:54:33.528 --> 00:54:34.820
A scribe?

480
00:54:35.652 --> 00:54:37.860
For the letter you offered to write.

481
00:54:40.904 --> 00:54:42.528
What letter?

482
00:54:43.488 --> 00:54:46.988
My request to the King
on the occasion of my becoming a father.


483
00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:49.444
You're a father?

484
00:54:49.572 --> 00:54:52.196
Bring the child, they bring luck.

485
00:54:57.904 --> 00:55:00.072
The ears change hands!

486
00:55:08.988 --> 00:55:10.528
What's in the bag?

487
00:55:10.652 --> 00:55:12.112
Allow me.

488
00:55:18.488 --> 00:55:20.028
Well, well!

489
00:55:28.196 --> 00:55:29.488
Magistrate.

490
00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:34.028
This... is worthless.

491
00:55:39.196 --> 00:55:41.860
Coconuts are worthless, right?

492
00:55:42.696 --> 00:55:43.988
Doesn't matter.

493
00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:45.780
I'll keep it anyway.

494
00:55:46.652 --> 00:55:47.988
Officer,

495
00:55:48.572 --> 00:55:50.944
see our friend to the city gates.

496
00:55:51.072 --> 00:55:52.904
<i>Vicuña Porto is dead.</i>

497
00:55:53.572 --> 00:55:55.236
<i>One shouldn't touch them.</i>

498
00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:57.196
<i>Don't touch.</i>

499
00:55:57.488 --> 00:55:58.612
<i>No.</i>

500
00:56:01.196 --> 00:56:03.488
<i>The ears of Vicuña Porto.</i>

501
00:56:04.488 --> 00:56:06.028
<i>Vicuña...</i>

502
00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:09.152
<i>...is dead.</i>

503
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:12.488
<i>The ears of Vicuña Porto.</i>

504
00:56:12.612 --> 00:56:13.944
Governor,

505
00:56:14.528 --> 00:56:16.860
could you attend to the letter?

506
00:56:16.988 --> 00:56:18.320
Of course.

507
00:56:19.196 --> 00:56:22.152
A letter to the King requesting your transfer.

508
00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:25.236
We'll plead to His
Majesty for my good friend.

509
00:56:51.736 --> 00:56:53.572
What are you writing?

510
00:56:57.528 --> 00:56:59.360
A book, Governor.

511
00:57:00.072 --> 00:57:03.028
We need to draft a letter
to be sealed and...


512
00:57:03.152 --> 00:57:04.944
A book?

513
00:57:05.944 --> 00:57:07.528
A book?

514
00:57:08.572 --> 00:57:10.196
Make children,

515
00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:12.988
not books.

516
00:57:13.736 --> 00:57:16.944
Learn a lesson from our Magistrate, Manuel.

517
00:57:22.196 --> 00:57:24.528
I can't know how my children will be.

518
00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.612
But I do know
how this book will be.

519
00:57:35.988 --> 00:57:39.320
Your Eminence,
I believe there's nothing to worry about.


520
00:57:48.652 --> 00:57:50.196
Let's go.

521
00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.196
Should I look for another scribe?
- Let's go!


522
00:58:08.488 --> 00:58:10.404
Should I look for another scribe?

523
00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:13.860
Why write a book
inside the house of Government,


524
00:58:13.988 --> 00:58:17.196
while others work for
the glory of His Majesty?

525
00:58:17.736 --> 00:58:19.360
I only wish...

526
00:58:22.236 --> 00:58:24.444
Were you aware of this book?

527
00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:28.320
Your Eminence,
I believe there's nothing to worry about.


528
00:58:28.444 --> 00:58:30.488
You didn't know about this book?

529
00:58:31.444 --> 00:58:33.360
I never knew about the book.

530
00:58:33.488 --> 00:58:37.028
How long have you been here, Zama?
You knew nothing about it?


531
00:58:39.696 --> 00:58:44.360
The oldest functionary in the Administration
knows nothing about this book?


532
00:58:50.028 --> 00:58:52.696
I want to grill
those fish with their heads.

533
00:59:00.196 --> 00:59:03.944
Get the horses out of here.
This isn't a stable.


534
00:59:14.488 --> 00:59:17.736
What is it?
- A message for Diego de Zama.


535
00:59:18.944 --> 00:59:22.028
That's me. What is it?
- Inventory.


536
00:59:25.196 --> 00:59:26.820
What inventory?

537
00:59:26.944 --> 00:59:29.488
They're taking everything to the patio.

538
00:59:33.736 --> 00:59:37.444
The Governor
commands everyone to clean and tidy up.


539
00:59:51.652 --> 00:59:53.280
Take this.

540
01:00:34.488 --> 01:00:38.112
I know the Governor has requested
you report on my book.


541
01:00:38.572 --> 01:00:40.072
Here it is.

542
01:00:40.528 --> 01:00:42.528
For your consideration.

543
01:00:43.696 --> 01:00:45.112
Fernández,

544
01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:48.280
I haven't yet decided
on my new residence.


545
01:00:48.696 --> 01:00:51.944
I need to keep my furniture
in the chapel a bit longer.


546
01:00:52.072 --> 01:00:53.528
Let me help you.

547
01:00:54.112 --> 01:00:55.736
You're my first reader.

548
01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.612
Which are your things?

549
01:01:00.152 --> 01:01:01.572
The bed.

550
01:01:02.612 --> 01:01:04.360
These three chairs.

551
01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:09.320
Two small chests with my name on them.

552
01:01:30.488 --> 01:01:33.696
They're making an inventory
of the Government's property.


553
01:01:34.988 --> 01:01:37.280
Your furniture has been listed.

554
01:01:38.652 --> 01:01:40.528
I could remove some things.

555
01:01:41.904 --> 01:01:44.320
But it has a cost.

556
01:01:44.696 --> 01:01:46.488
How inadequate!

557
01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:49.152
When I've settled in a new residence,

558
01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.196
I'll send for my belongings.

559
01:01:53.196 --> 01:01:56.528
We must do it now,
and with the utmost discretion.


560
01:01:58.944 --> 01:02:01.860
I was told of
an inn on the outskirts.

561
01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.860
Let me help you.

562
01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.112
You're my first reader.

563
01:02:09.072 --> 01:02:10.860
Take care of the move.

564
01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.780
That boy she's holding is my son.

565
01:02:54.528 --> 01:02:56.360
Is that the mother?
- Yes.


566
01:02:57.528 --> 01:02:58.860
That one.

567
01:03:00.404 --> 01:03:01.736
Emilia.

568
01:03:04.904 --> 01:03:06.112
Fernández,

569
01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:09.444
take that bed to Señora Emilia.

570
01:04:23.904 --> 01:04:25.820
What is this dump?

571
01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.652
The porters,

572
01:04:45.488 --> 01:04:47.488
they're afraid of this house.

573
01:04:52.152 --> 01:04:53.612
Leave it there.

574
01:05:04.944 --> 01:05:07.072
I'll only stay a few days.

575
01:05:08.904 --> 01:05:11.944
Until I find a proper residence.

576
01:05:18.072 --> 01:05:20.612
Keep the book until you finish it.

577
01:05:20.736 --> 01:05:22.444
I haven't made a copy.

578
01:05:22.572 --> 01:05:25.444
I know nothing about your book.

579
01:05:25.572 --> 01:05:29.696
I never knew it existed.
And no one has requested a report.


580
01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:35.152
The Governor feels that working hours
at the Government House are to serve the King.


581
01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.612
Your Grace,

582
01:05:37.904 --> 01:05:39.488
with all due respect,

583
01:05:40.696 --> 01:05:43.196
I have no master,
when I write my book.

584
01:06:00.652 --> 01:06:02.696
I wish it were the inexplicable.

585
01:06:04.488 --> 01:06:06.112
But a boy is in there.

586
01:06:08.072 --> 01:06:09.860
Bury this book,

587
01:06:09.988 --> 01:06:12.696
until all of this blows over, Fernández.

588
01:06:27.152 --> 01:06:28.612
Go away!

589
01:06:43.444 --> 01:06:44.988
Who are you?

590
01:06:47.944 --> 01:06:49.360
Zumala.

591
01:06:50.988 --> 01:06:53.404
Bring me a chain and a lock.

592
01:06:55.112 --> 01:06:57.528
No one enters this house.

593
01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:02.820
Tell the innkeeper
to bring me a chain and a lock.


594
01:07:06.696 --> 01:07:08.196
He's sick.

595
01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.404
The innkeeper is sick.

596
01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:29.072
I need a shirt.

597
01:07:29.196 --> 01:07:30.820
Am I your wife?

598
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.612
You're the mother of my son.

599
01:08:20.988 --> 01:08:23.488
Governor, should I fetch another scribe

600
01:08:23.612 --> 01:08:27.404
for the letter to
the King that you suggested?

601
01:08:30.152 --> 01:08:32.780
No letter without a report.

602
01:08:33.696 --> 01:08:35.196
What report?

603
01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:37.652
Do I need to ask for it?

604
01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:43.072
A book is being written behind the Crown's back,
which is your back as well.


605
01:08:43.196 --> 01:08:46.320
Your Eminence, 
I don't think you should worry.

606
01:08:48.236 --> 01:08:50.112
You should worry.

607
01:08:50.236 --> 01:08:53.072
I expect a damning report, ruthless,

608
01:08:55.112 --> 01:08:57.820
that puts an end to this chicanery.

609
01:08:58.904 --> 01:09:02.860
Only then will I be willing to
make your request to the King.


610
01:09:03.944 --> 01:09:06.988
Leaving out, of course,
that your son is a bastard.


611
01:09:09.736 --> 01:09:11.528
The Magistrate knows well

612
01:09:12.072 --> 01:09:17.112
that this benefit is only reserved
for a functionary's legitimate son.


613
01:09:22.736 --> 01:09:24.696
Governor,

614
01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:29.780
my transfer has suffered more delays
than those tolerable.


615
01:09:31.028 --> 01:09:32.860
Here's what I think:

616
01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.152
You want to leave?

617
01:09:36.404 --> 01:09:38.236
Write the report.

618
01:09:51.072 --> 01:09:52.572
He has his ways.

619
01:09:53.572 --> 01:09:56.404
They say he executed Vicuña without mercy.

620
01:11:02.444 --> 01:11:03.944
Zumala!

621
01:11:25.112 --> 01:11:26.320
Zumala...

622
01:11:27.572 --> 01:11:30.072
I rang the bell and nobody answered.

623
01:11:30.612 --> 01:11:32.488
I'd like to eat.

624
01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:34.736
We were sad.

625
01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:35.944
She died.

626
01:11:36.072 --> 01:11:37.444
Who died?

627
01:11:37.572 --> 01:11:39.652
Zumala is dead.

628
01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:42.572
Then who are you?

629
01:11:44.028 --> 01:11:45.696
Tora.

630
01:11:46.696 --> 01:11:48.028
Tora,

631
01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:51.320
you should introduce me to the other guests...

632
01:11:52.072 --> 01:11:56.404
the ladies with the hair...
- You are our only guest, Zama.


633
01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:03.736
Magistrate...

634
01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:10.780
The Governor ordered this rearrangement.

635
01:13:55.988 --> 01:13:57.696
At your service.

636
01:14:20.196 --> 01:14:22.444
These are days of scarce work

637
01:14:24.528 --> 01:14:26.360
for my Ministry.

638
01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.696
I've been informed of that.

639
01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:34.572
Did the Governor mention the report?

640
01:14:34.696 --> 01:14:36.072
What report?

641
01:14:36.196 --> 01:14:37.904
You were told about it.

642
01:14:39.652 --> 01:14:40.988
No.

643
01:14:41.572 --> 01:14:45.360
The Governor only told me to relocate here.

644
01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:55.444
Here!

645
01:14:59.612 --> 01:15:01.152
That's for me.

646
01:15:10.488 --> 01:15:12.780
These are doña Emilia's fish.

647
01:15:21.236 --> 01:15:23.112
Gifts from doña Emilia?

648
01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:27.820
They were bought.

649
01:15:28.612 --> 01:15:30.112
Not gifts.

650
01:16:12.196 --> 01:16:13.820
Overdue payments.

651
01:16:14.572 --> 01:16:17.280
29 times 1,000 makes 29,000.

652
01:16:19.904 --> 01:16:22.528
Minus 3,500 already received, makes...

653
01:16:24.696 --> 01:16:26.280
25,500.

654
01:16:30.152 --> 01:16:32.028
This house is rotten.

655
01:16:32.904 --> 01:16:34.572
Rest, don Diego.

656
01:16:34.904 --> 01:16:38.152
The sealed letter is the one that counts,
Fernández.


657
01:16:41.236 --> 01:16:43.944
Crossing the ocean to make a plea...

658
01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:14.072
Take it easy.

659
01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.736
It's hot.

660
01:18:27.572 --> 01:18:29.152
At night,

661
01:18:29.572 --> 01:18:32.320
we could hear a great noise.

662
01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:34.404
Then they appeared.

663
01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:36.904
They're...

664
01:18:37.904 --> 01:18:39.780
round rocks,

665
01:18:39.904 --> 01:18:41.904
like coconuts,

666
01:18:42.028 --> 01:18:43.528
but made of stone.

667
01:18:44.112 --> 01:18:47.696
And their insides are filled with precious stones.

668
01:18:49.652 --> 01:18:51.152
So pretty...

669
01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:56.028
What marvels!

670
01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:05.572
I wouldn't want to tarnish Fernández's honor.

671
01:19:06.072 --> 01:19:08.944
Maybe send him to the city of Lerma,

672
01:19:09.072 --> 01:19:11.072
with a recommendation.

673
01:19:11.904 --> 01:19:13.320
He's very young.

674
01:19:13.444 --> 01:19:16.652
A minor sentence should be enough warning.

675
01:19:18.152 --> 01:19:20.320
Excellent.

676
01:19:22.652 --> 01:19:24.320
Ruthless.

677
01:19:26.572 --> 01:19:28.152
Such a...

678
01:19:29.028 --> 01:19:30.528
sharp pen.

679
01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:37.612
Could Your Excellency write

680
01:19:37.736 --> 01:19:40.072
that letter you offered me?

681
01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:48.988
What letter?

682
01:19:50.528 --> 01:19:52.280
The letter to the King,

683
01:19:52.988 --> 01:19:55.072
requesting my transfer.

684
01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:57.736
Of course. You're a father now.

685
01:20:07.988 --> 01:20:10.404
The first letter is very important.

686
01:20:12.236 --> 01:20:14.236
What do you mean, the first letter?

687
01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:16.696
In a year or two,
we'll send the second one.

688
01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:20.652
His Majesty doesn't consider these matters
until the second time.


689
01:20:22.444 --> 01:20:25.196
I'll immediately send the first letter.

690
01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:33.028
I'll send the first letter, immediately.

691
01:21:34.988 --> 01:21:36.820
Don Diego de Zama.

692
01:21:39.988 --> 01:21:41.612
Thank you for coming.

693
01:21:42.072 --> 01:21:45.112
The list of your titles is impressive.

694
01:21:47.488 --> 01:21:49.488
You were a <i>corregidor</i>.

695
01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:55.488
It's surprising to find a volunteer
for a mission like this.


696
01:21:56.696 --> 01:21:58.444
Captain Parrilla

697
01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:01.944
is commanding the troops.

698
01:22:03.612 --> 01:22:05.944
Are you aware of the mission?

699
01:22:07.236 --> 01:22:09.820
We must get rid of Vicuña Porto.

700
01:22:09.944 --> 01:22:12.196
They won't beat us, Captain.

701
01:22:13.736 --> 01:22:16.196
What we seek is to reactivate commerce.

702
01:22:16.652 --> 01:22:18.820
We must put an end to theft,

703
01:22:19.236 --> 01:22:20.572
to arson,

704
01:22:20.696 --> 01:22:22.904
to gambling houses.

705
01:22:23.028 --> 01:22:25.236
We must clean up the trade routes.

706
01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:29.528
That is what my Administration
sets out to achieve.


707
01:22:31.404 --> 01:22:33.236
How long have you been here?

708
01:22:34.904 --> 01:22:36.612
A long time now.

709
01:22:39.696 --> 01:22:41.572
Excellent.

710
01:22:42.904 --> 01:22:45.320
We have your transfer request here.

711
01:22:47.488 --> 01:22:52.528
His Majesty will celebrate
this return to arms and especially to victory.


712
01:22:52.652 --> 01:22:55.444
We must bring back
the head of Vicuña Porto.

713
01:22:55.988 --> 01:22:58.404
You'll be received as heroes.

714
01:22:58.988 --> 01:23:00.696
With great pomp.

715
01:23:54.528 --> 01:23:58.736
I woke up last night
and felt something crawling on my neck.


716
01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:00.404
I went like this,

717
01:24:00.528 --> 01:24:03.320
and felt something strange.

718
01:24:04.612 --> 01:24:05.988
It's swollen.

719
01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.196
Must be a spider wasp.

720
01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:15.820
No. A spider.

721
01:24:57.612 --> 01:24:59.196
Is it an Indian?

722
01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:03.112
If so, there'll be pieces of silver.

723
01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:05.488
It's a dead man.

724
01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:13.528
The Indians, the canoeist
and the other two deserted.


725
01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:19.652
No silver?

726
01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:21.780
Nothing, only a dead man.

727
01:25:23.404 --> 01:25:26.320
Take some men and capture the deserters!

728
01:25:44.196 --> 01:25:46.612
Don't move. Be still.

729
01:25:55.988 --> 01:25:57.904
500 or more of them.

730
01:26:07.196 --> 01:26:09.028
They're the blind.

731
01:26:14.612 --> 01:26:16.696
Stay calm and you'll live.

732
01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:42.780
They were punished.

733
01:26:45.652 --> 01:26:48.904
And the children were born after the punishment.

734
01:26:53.652 --> 01:26:56.112
Punished by Vicuña Porto?

735
01:27:01.404 --> 01:27:03.280
Maybe by you people.

736
01:28:56.904 --> 01:28:58.860
They took the horses.

737
01:29:00.944 --> 01:29:03.320
They walk fast for blind people.

738
01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:08.320
They walk fast
so as not to disappoint their children.


739
01:29:13.236 --> 01:29:16.072
Nighttime is safer for the blind.

740
01:29:21.028 --> 01:29:23.280
I rather hide during the day.

741
01:29:26.404 --> 01:29:27.988
That's my sword.

742
01:29:29.612 --> 01:29:31.780
I should introduce myself.

743
01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:42.612
My name is Vicuña Porto.

744
01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:49.572
And you?

745
01:29:54.612 --> 01:29:56.780
What's the <i>corregidor</i>'s name?

746
01:29:57.488 --> 01:29:58.736
Mercy.

747
01:30:01.196 --> 01:30:03.196
What did you say, <i>corregidor</i>?

748
01:30:11.196 --> 01:30:13.820
Who's there?
- Diego de Zama.


749
01:30:15.488 --> 01:30:17.072
We're coming.

750
01:30:17.488 --> 01:30:19.404
They took the horses.

751
01:30:22.944 --> 01:30:24.444
There's nothing left.

752
01:30:25.028 --> 01:30:27.320
Don't say my name and you'll live.

753
01:30:47.612 --> 01:30:49.152
Halt!

754
01:30:49.404 --> 01:30:52.112
Two <i>Guanáes</i>are coming, don't turn around!

755
01:30:55.028 --> 01:30:56.696
Don't turn around.

756
01:30:57.696 --> 01:30:59.444
They're fantasized.

757
01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:02.488
"Fantasized?"

758
01:31:02.612 --> 01:31:04.072
Disguised.

759
01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:16.612
Friends.

760
01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.444
Stay still.

761
01:31:48.988 --> 01:31:51.196
They invited us to a celebration.

762
01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.780
A celebration?

763
01:31:53.112 --> 01:31:56.736
Tell them that the King of Spain,
Lord of these vast lands,


764
01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:59.696
sends his regards and offers His friendship.

765
01:32:10.572 --> 01:32:12.112
They want the animal.

766
01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.944
They want the animal.

767
01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:42.028
Does the <i>corregidor</i>have any suggestions?

768
01:32:49.444 --> 01:32:50.780
Let's go.

769
01:35:02.944 --> 01:35:04.196
Diego de Zama.

770
01:35:09.528 --> 01:35:11.572
Soldier Gaspar Toledo.

771
01:35:17.696 --> 01:35:19.780
Soldier Giusepe Nascimento.

772
01:35:23.236 --> 01:35:25.072
Soldier Umbilino Maria.

773
01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:41.320
We can't return without Vicuña Porto.

774
01:37:46.904 --> 01:37:49.152
See that man with the knife?

775
01:37:50.612 --> 01:37:52.360
That's Vicuña Porto.

776
01:38:08.572 --> 01:38:10.280
Traitor.

777
01:38:13.612 --> 01:38:15.780
Careful!

778
01:38:16.612 --> 01:38:18.196
Right in the middle.

779
01:38:23.404 --> 01:38:24.944
Food!

780
01:38:32.944 --> 01:38:34.944
We have food, Captain!

781
01:38:35.072 --> 01:38:37.652
Fish today!
- The famine is over!


782
01:38:37.988 --> 01:38:39.360
Food!

783
01:38:46.196 --> 01:38:47.944
Vicuña Porto!

784
01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:55.652
Tell your men to line
up and lay down their arms.

785
01:39:02.528 --> 01:39:03.860
It's over.

786
01:39:12.444 --> 01:39:14.112
Traitor!

787
01:39:29.528 --> 01:39:31.112
That smell.

788
01:39:41.904 --> 01:39:44.780
The tigers will smell that arm.

789
01:39:47.196 --> 01:39:50.320
Dead meat makes them curious.

790
01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.360
But they won't eat it.

791
01:39:57.152 --> 01:39:59.444
Instead, they'll pounce us.

792
01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:20.860
Don't tell them I'm sick.

793
01:40:22.736 --> 01:40:24.360
Traitor.

794
01:40:31.988 --> 01:40:34.112
Who's singing?

795
01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:42.528
Who sings?

796
01:41:43.072 --> 01:41:44.820
I've committed sins.

797
01:41:47.112 --> 01:41:49.152
But not all those...

798
01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:51.360
they blame on Vicuña Porto.

799
01:41:53.112 --> 01:41:54.860
Understand?

800
01:41:56.488 --> 01:41:58.072
That's right.

801
01:42:03.696 --> 01:42:07.360
The Vicuña Porto they talk about doesn't exist.

802
01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:13.528
It's not me.

803
01:42:14.444 --> 01:42:16.112
It's no one.

804
01:42:26.612 --> 01:42:28.404
It's a name.

805
01:42:29.072 --> 01:42:30.652
A name.

806
01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:33.572
Understand?

807
01:42:38.904 --> 01:42:41.320
My name is Gaspar Toledo.

808
01:42:44.072 --> 01:42:45.528
What is it?

809
01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:53.736
What's my name, <i>corregidor</i>?

810
01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:00.488
I'm not a <i>corregidor</i>.

811
01:43:01.944 --> 01:43:03.280
That's right.

812
01:43:04.112 --> 01:43:06.988
You're not the <i>corregidor</i>,

813
01:43:07.112 --> 01:43:09.360
and I'm not Vicuña Porto.

814
01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:11.320
But...

815
01:43:13.736 --> 01:43:16.028
my men want to get rich.

816
01:43:17.152 --> 01:43:18.736
My men

817
01:43:19.404 --> 01:43:21.028
want to be rich.

818
01:43:24.444 --> 01:43:27.028
I promised them it would be so.

819
01:43:29.736 --> 01:43:31.860
I need the <i>corregidor</i>

820
01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:34.904
to find the coconuts.

821
01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:38.652
What coconuts?

822
01:43:42.072 --> 01:43:44.280
You are the <i>corregidor</i>, right?

823
01:43:48.652 --> 01:43:50.360
A little water!

824
01:43:51.572 --> 01:43:53.944
The captain wants water?
- Water!


825
01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:15.696
Don't look at me, traitor. 
Not even a glance.

826
01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:17.780
Water.

827
01:44:21.528 --> 01:44:24.736
I have a plan. 
His Majesty will reward you.

828
01:44:27.196 --> 01:44:28.696
We'll return with honors...

829
01:45:14.444 --> 01:45:16.488
They want to get rich.

830
01:45:17.152 --> 01:45:18.360
Name the place.

831
01:45:18.488 --> 01:45:20.988
Anywhere North, any place will do.

832
01:45:21.112 --> 01:45:22.528
What place?

833
01:45:23.196 --> 01:45:24.696
Where the coconuts are!

834
01:45:25.612 --> 01:45:27.196
What coconuts?

835
01:45:27.904 --> 01:45:29.612
You're the <i>corregidor</i>.

836
01:45:29.820 --> 01:45:31.320
<i>Corregidor,</i>

837
01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:35.196
the place with the stones, the round stones.

838
01:45:36.112 --> 01:45:38.280
The guide doesn't know the place?

839
01:45:38.944 --> 01:45:40.572
I'm not a guide.

840
01:45:40.696 --> 01:45:42.780
The <i>corregidor</i>knows the place.

841
01:45:43.028 --> 01:45:45.944
The coconuts, full of precious stones.

842
01:45:47.444 --> 01:45:49.152
The <i>corregidor</i>knows...

843
01:45:52.488 --> 01:45:54.112
Those stones are worthless.

844
01:45:54.236 --> 01:45:56.320
He's lying!

845
01:45:59.236 --> 01:46:01.072
They're worthless.

846
01:46:03.072 --> 01:46:04.652
Traitor.

847
01:46:08.404 --> 01:46:10.320
They're worthless.

848
01:46:17.444 --> 01:46:19.028
He's lying!

849
01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:21.360
Where are the coconuts?

850
01:46:23.404 --> 01:46:24.944
Those stones are worthless.

851
01:46:25.072 --> 01:46:27.280
The stones!

852
01:46:27.404 --> 01:46:29.112
You're lying!

853
01:46:29.736 --> 01:46:30.860
You'll die!

854
01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:32.820
Death to Zama!

855
01:46:33.444 --> 01:46:34.696
Death!

856
01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:38.360
Leave!

857
01:46:39.112 --> 01:46:40.112
Leave!

858
01:46:40.528 --> 01:46:43.028
I do for you what
no one did for me.

859
01:46:43.152 --> 01:46:44.360
He's lying.

860
01:46:44.488 --> 01:46:45.572
Leave!

861
01:46:45.696 --> 01:46:47.488
I say no to your hopes.

862
01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:55.572
Death to Zama!

863
01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:03.320
Hold him.

864
01:47:04.612 --> 01:47:06.572
Shove your stumps in the sand.

865
01:47:06.696 --> 01:47:09.196
If you don't bleed out, you'll survive.

866
01:48:06.028 --> 01:48:08.072
Do you want to live?

867
01:48:17.528 --> 01:48:19.404
Do you want to live?
