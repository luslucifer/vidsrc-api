1
00:00:56.884 --> 00:00:59.520
You're gonna miss this, Juanito.

2
00:00:59.553 --> 00:01:00.854
I know.

3
00:01:00.888 --> 00:01:02.031
I am having lots
of second thoughts.


4
00:01:02.055 --> 00:01:03.857
Nah, you're doing the
right thing, though.


5
00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:04.692
I hope so.

6
00:01:04.725 --> 00:01:06.026
Of course you are, man.

7
00:01:06.059 --> 00:01:08.228
I know, but working at a desk?

8
00:01:08.262 --> 00:01:09.363
I mean...

9
00:01:09.397 --> 00:01:10.698
So you guys pick out

10
00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:12.376
a name yet, or-
You're wasting your time.


11
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.367
It's not gonna be Tony.

12
00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:14.568
Come on, man!

13
00:01:14.602 --> 00:01:16.904
I mean, Tony, that
is a good-ass name.


14
00:01:16.937 --> 00:01:18.238
I mean, not only you got,

15
00:01:18.272 --> 00:01:19.707
you got Uncle Tony here,

16
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.710
you also got Sir
Anthony Hopkins.


17
00:01:22.743 --> 00:01:23.711
Hannibal Lecter?

18
00:01:23.744 --> 00:01:24.712
Shit, yeah!

19
00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:25.879
Yeah, I don't think so.

20
00:01:25.913 --> 00:01:27.090
Well, I mean, you know he's not

21
00:01:27.114 --> 00:01:28.224
actually Hannibal,
though, right?


22
00:01:28.248 --> 00:01:29.383
I mean, ask anyone.

23
00:01:29.417 --> 00:01:30.894
Say, "Hey, y'all know
Anthony Hopkins?",


24
00:01:30.918 --> 00:01:33.387
and it'll be like, "Oh,
the dude who eats people?"


25
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:34.555
Shit!

26
00:01:34.588 --> 00:01:36.724
All right, well, what
about Marc Anthony?


27
00:01:36.757 --> 00:01:37.558
Idiot.

28
00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:39.427
Divorced J
-Lo, bad move.

29
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.729
I meant the other,
the other Marc Antony.


30
00:01:41.762 --> 00:01:43.230
He killed himself, didn't he?

31
00:01:43.263 --> 00:01:44.064
Oh, fuck it!

32
00:01:44.097 --> 00:01:44.932
What's it gonna be?

33
00:01:44.965 --> 00:01:46.600
Juan Jose Ortado Moreno III.

34
00:01:46.634 --> 00:01:50.738
Fuckin' hell, man!

35
00:01:50.771 --> 00:01:51.905
No, it's Juan Junior.

36
00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.741
Jeez, that's such a
lack of imagination!


37
00:01:53.774 --> 00:01:55.743
It's my name, man,
and my dad's name.


38
00:01:55.776 --> 00:01:57.921
Yeah, but how many Juans do
we need in the world, right?


39
00:01:57.945 --> 00:01:59.079
Just Juan.

40
00:01:59.112 --> 00:02:01.415
Like Juan Two and Juan Three?

41
00:02:03.116 --> 00:02:04.794
Man, I can't believe we
have this calvary behind


42
00:02:04.818 --> 00:02:06.754
for such a small-time bust.

43
00:02:06.787 --> 00:02:09.256
It's over the top,
if you ask me.


44
00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.791
These guys are small-timers.

45
00:02:10.824 --> 00:02:12.259
Gotta take out the small-timers

46
00:02:12.292 --> 00:02:14.795
before they become
big-timers, right?


47
00:02:14.828 --> 00:02:15.929
Right.

48
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.631
Now, you sit and
stay here, all right?


49
00:02:50.664 --> 00:02:51.664
Fuck you!

50
00:02:55.168 --> 00:02:55.969
Be right back.

51
00:02:56.003 --> 00:02:56.804
Hey, don't say that.

52
00:02:56.837 --> 00:02:58.005
It's bad luck.

53
00:02:58.038 --> 00:02:59.182
I still need you to
pay for the baptism.


54
00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:00.841
Yeah, are we done here?

55
00:03:00.874 --> 00:03:02.486
People got responsibilities,
important jobs to do.


56
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.311
Just leave it to the pros.

57
00:03:04.344 --> 00:03:06.313
Yeah, get the fuck outta here.

58
00:03:26.867 --> 00:03:28.011
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

59
00:03:28.035 --> 00:03:28.836
Ándele!

60
00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:29.869
Rápido, rápido!

61
00:03:36.877 --> 00:03:37.678
Atención!

62
00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:39.513
Esta es la DEA!

63
00:03:39.547 --> 00:03:41.381
Ándele! Andele!

64
00:04:57.625 --> 00:04:58.959
No, Fernando's not here yet.

65
00:05:05.966 --> 00:05:07.134
No!

66
00:05:10.638 --> 00:05:12.139
No, no, no,.

67
00:05:23.316 --> 00:05:24.618
Get up.

68
00:05:24.652 --> 00:05:26.119
Let's go.

69
00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:42.670
Is everything okay?

70
00:05:44.838 --> 00:05:47.307
Your mom's gonna
say no either way.


71
00:06:01.855 --> 00:06:02.856
Cover me!

72
00:06:10.197 --> 00:06:11.197
Fucker!

73
00:06:18.038 --> 00:06:19.339
Heads up in the alley!

74
00:06:19.372 --> 00:06:20.340
Well, I like the two bedroom.

75
00:06:20.373 --> 00:06:21.541
Why don't we get that one?

76
00:06:23.376 --> 00:06:24.678
Okay.

77
00:06:24.712 --> 00:06:25.713
Freeze!

78
00:06:25.746 --> 00:06:27.014
Drop your weapon!

79
00:06:30.217 --> 00:06:31.351
Shit!

80
00:06:36.056 --> 00:06:36.690
Oh, my god!

81
00:06:36.724 --> 00:06:38.358
Oh, my god!

82
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:39.693
Juan!

83
00:06:39.727 --> 00:06:41.695
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- Oh, my god!


84
00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:43.039
- No, no, no, no, Juan!
- Oh, my god!


85
00:06:43.063 --> 00:06:44.197
Fuckin' A.

86
00:06:44.231 --> 00:06:45.365
I need some help!

87
00:06:46.734 --> 00:06:47.868
- Oh, my god!
- Come on, man!


88
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:48.702
Just don't!

89
00:06:48.736 --> 00:06:50.037
Don't you fuckin' do this to me!

90
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.071
Come on, man!

91
00:06:51.104 --> 00:06:51.872
I know!

92
00:06:51.905 --> 00:06:52.905
Fuck!

93
00:06:56.109 --> 00:06:57.109
Fuck, man!

94
00:06:58.111 --> 00:06:59.880
I need some help!

95
00:07:01.915 --> 00:07:04.384
Come on, man!

96
00:07:04.417 --> 00:07:05.417
Fuck, man!

97
00:07:06.286 --> 00:07:07.721
Jesus Christ!

98
00:07:07.755 --> 00:07:09.389
I'm so sorry, man!

99
00:07:54.668 --> 00:07:55.803
Oh, my god!

100
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.772
I don't believe it!

101
00:07:58.806 --> 00:08:00.941
Hi, Nick!

102
00:08:00.974 --> 00:08:03.110
How the hell did you find me?

103
00:08:03.143 --> 00:08:05.454
It wasn't easy, but then
again, it wasn't that difficult.


104
00:08:05.478 --> 00:08:06.622
Permission to come aboard, sir?

105
00:08:06.646 --> 00:08:08.782
- Permission granted.
- Yeah, thank you.


106
00:08:08.816 --> 00:08:10.450
- Care for a libation?
- Always!


107
00:08:13.653 --> 00:08:14.653
Whoo!

108
00:08:15.989 --> 00:08:17.801
So this is what retirement
in Mexico looks like?


109
00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:20.460
Yeah, it's my house, I guess.

110
00:08:22.996 --> 00:08:23.964
I'm trying to remember,

111
00:08:23.997 --> 00:08:25.132
was that with water, or...

112
00:08:25.165 --> 00:08:26.333
Just a little

113
00:08:26.366 --> 00:08:28.135
ice in there, that's fine.
All right.


114
00:08:28.168 --> 00:08:29.837
Yeah!

115
00:08:31.171 --> 00:08:33.140
I could get used to
this very easily.


116
00:08:33.173 --> 00:08:35.475
Yo!

117
00:08:35.508 --> 00:08:36.676
Oh, salut then.
Salut.


118
00:08:40.848 --> 00:08:43.050
It's good to see you, Nick.

119
00:08:44.517 --> 00:08:45.517
Yeah.

120
00:08:46.854 --> 00:08:48.388
This isn't a social visit, Nick.

121
00:08:50.724 --> 00:08:53.326
I have three black warrants
I need you to execute.


122
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.362
Maybe you didn't get the hints

123
00:08:55.395 --> 00:08:57.664
because of my formal attire,

124
00:08:57.697 --> 00:08:59.032
but I am retired.

125
00:09:00.868 --> 00:09:02.069
Your country needs you.

126
00:09:02.903 --> 00:09:05.338
Oh, Francis!

127
00:09:05.372 --> 00:09:07.340
You don't get it, do you?

128
00:09:07.374 --> 00:09:09.176
I mean, do you know
what my day is like?


129
00:09:09.209 --> 00:09:11.678
And I'd say, pretty
much every day.


130
00:09:11.711 --> 00:09:15.015
I get up in the
morning, I take a pee,


131
00:09:15.048 --> 00:09:17.217
then I eat breakfast,
take a shit,


132
00:09:18.385 --> 00:09:20.187
possibly go into town.

133
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.190
The afternoon, I like
to grab a little siesta.


134
00:09:23.223 --> 00:09:26.726
And then at the end of
the day, a cocktail,


135
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.695
just like the one I'm
enjoying right now.


136
00:09:28.728 --> 00:09:29.696
And that's the way you'd like to

137
00:09:29.729 --> 00:09:30.898
spend the rest of your days?

138
00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:33.200
Well, I wouldn't
mind getting laid


139
00:09:33.233 --> 00:09:34.534
a little bit more often,

140
00:09:34.567 --> 00:09:37.537
but yeah, that's pretty much it.

141
00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.072
We have a mole in the agency.

142
00:09:40.941 --> 00:09:42.209
- Oh.
- By the time we


143
00:09:42.242 --> 00:09:43.386
clear everybody
it'll be too late.


144
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.612
That's why we need you,
and we need you now.


145
00:09:47.247 --> 00:09:49.049
I got $600,000 in this bag.

146
00:09:49.082 --> 00:09:50.750
That's $200,000 a warrant.

147
00:09:55.422 --> 00:09:56.389
Imminent danger.

148
00:09:56.423 --> 00:09:58.058
We've got three, four days tops.

149
00:10:07.634 --> 00:10:08.902
Let me get my readers.

150
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.405
You must really be retired?

151
00:10:12.439 --> 00:10:13.440
Yes, I am.

152
00:10:23.116 --> 00:10:25.252
You folks must really
be up against the wall.


153
00:10:25.285 --> 00:10:26.286
We are.

154
00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:29.622
Yeah, it's nice!

155
00:10:35.295 --> 00:10:36.295
Bin Farri?

156
00:10:37.664 --> 00:10:39.799
My god, that was 25 years ago!

157
00:10:39.833 --> 00:10:40.767
What is this?

158
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.269
Well, you know,

159
00:10:42.302 --> 00:10:44.471
after everything went down
in Miami the way it did,


160
00:10:44.504 --> 00:10:45.638
he was untouchable.

161
00:10:45.672 --> 00:10:46.606
Too high profile.

162
00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:48.141
We couldn't go after him again.

163
00:10:48.175 --> 00:10:50.495
Well, he's reappeared on the
radar with something very bad.


164
00:10:54.347 --> 00:10:56.283
Nick, before you say anything,

165
00:10:56.316 --> 00:10:58.118
I gotta let you
know, if you say no,


166
00:10:58.151 --> 00:10:59.319
well, there's a good chance

167
00:10:59.352 --> 00:11:01.121
that you might be
exposed about Miami.


168
00:11:01.154 --> 00:11:03.290
- You son of a bitch!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!


169
00:11:03.323 --> 00:11:04.624
It's not me.

170
00:11:04.657 --> 00:11:05.492
You know I wouldn't do
something like that.


171
00:11:05.525 --> 00:11:06.793
It's those guys.

172
00:11:06.826 --> 00:11:08.337
They can't take a
chance on you saying no.


173
00:11:08.361 --> 00:11:09.162
That's why they sent me.

174
00:11:09.196 --> 00:11:10.130
They know we're friends.

175
00:11:10.163 --> 00:11:11.464
Oh, some friend you are!

176
00:11:11.498 --> 00:11:13.133
You've got a lot
of balls sayin' that.


177
00:11:13.166 --> 00:11:14.301
Huh?

178
00:11:14.334 --> 00:11:16.303
After everything
I did for your son?


179
00:11:16.336 --> 00:11:17.470
The son you abandoned?

180
00:11:17.504 --> 00:11:19.306
If that doesn't
prove our friendship,


181
00:11:19.339 --> 00:11:20.807
I don't know what does.

182
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.985
What the hell kinda thing
is that to say to me?


183
00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:23.476
- That's not what I'm saying!
- Look-


184
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:24.644
Okay, yeah.

185
00:11:24.677 --> 00:11:26.313
Well, don't think I'm
enjoying bein' here


186
00:11:26.346 --> 00:11:27.680
layin' all this shit on ya!

187
00:11:29.849 --> 00:11:31.318
Nick, I wouldn't be here

188
00:11:31.351 --> 00:11:33.686
if this wasn't a situation
of national security.


189
00:11:37.024 --> 00:11:38.025
And who's the other guy?

190
00:11:38.058 --> 00:11:39.993
Oh, that's Polat, the Turk.

191
00:11:40.027 --> 00:11:41.494
You take him out,

192
00:11:41.528 --> 00:11:43.997
and, well, Bin Farri's whole
money laundering scheme


193
00:11:44.031 --> 00:11:45.031
goes to hell.

194
00:11:45.865 --> 00:11:47.367
And this guy's some character.

195
00:11:48.535 --> 00:11:51.038
He has a large appetite
for 12-year-old girls.


196
00:11:52.372 --> 00:11:54.007
12-year-old girls
turned prostitutes


197
00:11:54.041 --> 00:11:55.675
by Bin Farri and his people.

198
00:11:55.708 --> 00:11:56.708
Jesus!

199
00:12:01.048 --> 00:12:03.516
This one?
That's Mustafar.


200
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.684
He introduced Bin Farri

201
00:12:04.717 --> 00:12:07.020
to a number of
terrorist organizations.


202
00:12:07.054 --> 00:12:09.189
We have confirmation that
they have a cargo shipment


203
00:12:09.222 --> 00:12:10.390
comin' in to Mexico.

204
00:12:11.558 --> 00:12:13.260
We believe it's
biological weapons.


205
00:12:14.727 --> 00:12:15.862
Yeah.

206
00:12:15.895 --> 00:12:17.364
This is serious.

207
00:12:17.397 --> 00:12:18.397
Well...

208
00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:20.200
Come on, buddy.

209
00:12:20.233 --> 00:12:21.233
You can do this.

210
00:12:23.903 --> 00:12:25.072
It'll be like old times.

211
00:12:27.574 --> 00:12:28.708
And I'll tell you what,

212
00:12:28.741 --> 00:12:30.219
if they ask you to do
anything after this,


213
00:12:30.243 --> 00:12:32.055
I promise you I'll tell
'em to go fuck themselves.


214
00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:33.413
- Oh!
- I will!


215
00:12:33.446 --> 00:12:34.381
And I'll quit.

216
00:12:34.414 --> 00:12:35.382
- Ho-ho!
- I will!


217
00:12:35.415 --> 00:12:36.883
I'll quit, and I'll come,

218
00:12:36.916 --> 00:12:39.719
and, well, I'll live with
you on this floating mansion.


219
00:12:39.752 --> 00:12:40.954
I'll be your first mate.

220
00:12:42.422 --> 00:12:43.923
What do you say?

221
00:12:43.957 --> 00:12:47.294
Frankie, if you do
that, remember this.


222
00:12:48.295 --> 00:12:52.232
Out at sea, I am in command.

223
00:12:52.265 --> 00:12:54.934
Aye aye, Captain.

224
00:13:05.945 --> 00:13:06.945
Hey, man.

225
00:13:08.115 --> 00:13:11.084
I would encourage you to
ask for a permanent transfer


226
00:13:11.118 --> 00:13:12.485
to another field office.

227
00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:15.588
I'm good.

228
00:13:15.622 --> 00:13:16.656
You sure?

229
00:13:18.458 --> 00:13:19.602
Okay.
What do you got for me?


230
00:13:19.626 --> 00:13:24.631
So San Mar was
bought five months ago.


231
00:13:25.999 --> 00:13:27.776
They import chandeliers from
China and all their parts.


232
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.968
They assemble them,

233
00:13:30.637 --> 00:13:33.273
then wholesale them to distributors
all around the country.


234
00:13:33.306 --> 00:13:34.441
Papers are straight.

235
00:13:34.474 --> 00:13:36.276
They're clean as a whistle.

236
00:13:36.309 --> 00:13:37.777
The shooter?

237
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:42.282
Confirmed to be Zacarias
Zapata, a.k.a. Zico.


238
00:13:42.315 --> 00:13:44.651
He was locked up in El
Hongo, last I heard,


239
00:13:44.684 --> 00:13:48.121
but somebody must have paid
lots of money to get him out.


240
00:13:48.155 --> 00:13:50.123
You're telling me

241
00:13:50.157 --> 00:13:52.959
there are no bad apples
in that entire barrel?


242
00:13:52.992 --> 00:13:54.161
Come on!

243
00:13:54.194 --> 00:13:56.463
No one seems to
know who Zico is.


244
00:13:56.496 --> 00:13:58.131
They're probably lying,

245
00:13:58.165 --> 00:14:00.667
but I would, if I was
them, too, you know?


246
00:14:02.502 --> 00:14:04.003
- Here you go.
- Thank you.


247
00:14:05.372 --> 00:14:06.473
What is it?

248
00:14:06.506 --> 00:14:07.807
Polat.

249
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.975
Polat?

250
00:14:09.008 --> 00:14:10.143
Yeah.

251
00:14:10.177 --> 00:14:11.644
Who the hell's Polat?

252
00:14:11.678 --> 00:14:12.979
The manager.

253
00:14:13.012 --> 00:14:14.481
He's the only non
-Mexican there.

254
00:14:14.514 --> 00:14:16.015
I don't know, somethin'
just rubbed me


255
00:14:16.049 --> 00:14:18.318
the wrong way about him,
so I ran his prints.


256
00:14:34.701 --> 00:14:35.502
I was about to come find you.

257
00:14:35.535 --> 00:14:36.535
Come here.

258
00:14:38.037 --> 00:14:39.172
I know.

259
00:14:39.206 --> 00:14:40.673
I heard it.

260
00:14:40.707 --> 00:14:41.674
What do you mean?

261
00:14:41.708 --> 00:14:44.711
I was on the phone with him.

262
00:14:44.744 --> 00:14:46.513
Jesus!

263
00:14:46.546 --> 00:14:47.847
I heard everything.

264
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.516
I'm so sorry.

265
00:15:05.064 --> 00:15:06.866
Two fucking hours!

266
00:15:08.435 --> 00:15:09.569
What?

267
00:15:09.602 --> 00:15:10.879
I've been waiting for two hours

268
00:15:10.903 --> 00:15:12.038
to take a piss.

269
00:15:13.072 --> 00:15:14.707
Sorry, it's been busy here.

270
00:15:14.741 --> 00:15:15.875
I didn't shoot anyone.

271
00:15:15.908 --> 00:15:17.877
I don't know who that guy was.

272
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.550
I never saw that person
in my entire life.


273
00:15:19.579 --> 00:15:20.880
Just shut the fuck up.

274
00:15:20.913 --> 00:15:21.948
Yeah?
Jesus!


275
00:15:23.583 --> 00:15:27.053
So what do you do for San Mar?

276
00:15:27.086 --> 00:15:29.122
I manage the
shipping and receiving.


277
00:15:30.257 --> 00:15:31.758
You wanna try that again?

278
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:34.460
Polat?

279
00:15:36.263 --> 00:15:37.730
Polat.

280
00:15:37.764 --> 00:15:39.232
Who is that?

281
00:15:39.266 --> 00:15:42.902
FBI, Interpol, Europol,
Turkish Intelligence.


282
00:15:42.935 --> 00:15:45.405
Shit, man, you got warrants
out from all of them!


283
00:15:45.438 --> 00:15:47.407
How long you been
on the run, hmm?


284
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.908
It's been a while.

285
00:15:48.941 --> 00:15:50.410
Money laundering,
though, that's...


286
00:15:50.443 --> 00:15:51.578
It's good business.

287
00:15:51.611 --> 00:15:53.580
Until someone gets pissed off,

288
00:15:53.613 --> 00:15:56.449
or you get caught, like this.

289
00:15:56.483 --> 00:15:57.284
I get it!

290
00:15:57.317 --> 00:15:59.252
I'm in shit!

291
00:15:59.286 --> 00:16:00.753
Okay!

292
00:16:00.787 --> 00:16:02.789
Listen.

293
00:16:02.822 --> 00:16:04.957
This is going to be
like Christmas for you.


294
00:16:06.459 --> 00:16:09.596
Okay, I'm going to give you
exactly who you really want.


295
00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:10.963
Oh, yeah?

296
00:16:10.997 --> 00:16:13.132
And who do we really want?

297
00:16:14.467 --> 00:16:17.304
You make me a deal,

298
00:16:17.337 --> 00:16:20.640
and I will give you
Hussein Bin Farri.


299
00:16:24.143 --> 00:16:26.279
Now who the fuck is that?

300
00:16:26.313 --> 00:16:27.780
You don't know
Hussein Bin Farri?


301
00:16:27.814 --> 00:16:28.948
- No.
- No, we don't know.


302
00:16:28.981 --> 00:16:30.617
Are you fucking with me?

303
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.151
Do you live in a cave?

304
00:16:32.185 --> 00:16:35.655
There is Rashida Bin Farri
at the new cultural center.


305
00:16:35.688 --> 00:16:36.956
Nice woman.

306
00:16:36.989 --> 00:16:39.626
No, no, no, no,
that's the niece.


307
00:16:39.659 --> 00:16:40.960
She is...

308
00:16:40.993 --> 00:16:41.961
Nevermind!

309
00:16:41.994 --> 00:16:43.963
This guy, he's a
terrorist, okay?


310
00:16:43.996 --> 00:16:45.841
Okay, what the fuck is
this guy talking about?


311
00:16:45.865 --> 00:16:46.999
Hey, gringo!

312
00:16:47.033 --> 00:16:48.635
You've heard of Bin Laden, yeah?

313
00:16:48.668 --> 00:16:49.802
Yeah.

314
00:16:49.836 --> 00:16:50.637
You think Bin Laden
was a terrorist?


315
00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:51.638
Yeah.

316
00:16:51.671 --> 00:16:52.839
This guy says to Bin Laden,

317
00:16:52.872 --> 00:16:55.808
"Hey, Osama, get the
fuck out of my way!"


318
00:16:55.842 --> 00:16:57.810
Okay.

319
00:16:57.844 --> 00:17:00.813
So señor, if I was you,

320
00:17:00.847 --> 00:17:04.984
I would pay careful attention
to everything I have to say.


321
00:17:05.017 --> 00:17:07.687
But first, we talk deal.

322
00:17:09.021 --> 00:17:13.159
Then I give you everything
about the operation.


323
00:17:13.192 --> 00:17:14.827
What operation?

324
00:17:14.861 --> 00:17:16.195
You fucking people!

325
00:17:17.864 --> 00:17:20.833
I will give you a
very small hint, okay?


326
00:17:20.867 --> 00:17:23.536
Unless you do
something to stop him,


327
00:17:25.037 --> 00:17:29.208
Bin Farri is going to level
the United States economy.


328
00:17:29.242 --> 00:17:33.212
And then any country that has
extra cash laying around, hmm?


329
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:38.217
Are you talking about a bomb?

330
00:17:39.552 --> 00:17:41.053
Better.

331
00:17:41.087 --> 00:17:43.690
They have some
fancy-schmancy machine.


332
00:17:43.723 --> 00:17:46.693
It was unloading when you
guys made your freaky scene.


333
00:17:46.726 --> 00:17:50.062
You talkin' about
that van outside?


334
00:17:50.096 --> 00:17:51.531
I don't know.

335
00:17:51.564 --> 00:17:52.875
Those guys, they were
just unloadin' somethin'.


336
00:17:52.899 --> 00:17:54.033
They were all clean.

337
00:17:54.066 --> 00:17:56.202
They were unloading a
chandelier or some shit.


338
00:17:56.235 --> 00:17:57.570
- A chandelier, huh?
- Yeah.


339
00:17:57.604 --> 00:17:59.872
Can a chandelier turn
off a whole country?


340
00:17:59.906 --> 00:18:02.041
Because this one does!

341
00:18:02.074 --> 00:18:03.410
What are you talking about?

342
00:18:03.443 --> 00:18:04.877
Turn off a country?

343
00:18:04.911 --> 00:18:07.380
No more until
you make me a deal.


344
00:18:07.414 --> 00:18:10.717
As example of good
faith negotiation,


345
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.386
I will give you all the goods

346
00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.254
on Bin Farri's shell companies

347
00:18:15.288 --> 00:18:17.223
where he launders his money.

348
00:18:17.256 --> 00:18:19.726
I just need access to my laptop.

349
00:18:19.759 --> 00:18:21.093
This guy sounds like a snake,

350
00:18:21.127 --> 00:18:23.229
just willing to
give up his boss.


351
00:18:23.262 --> 00:18:25.097
Yeah, well, under
these circumstances,


352
00:18:25.131 --> 00:18:28.401
I'm entitled to go through
a selfish phase, no?


353
00:18:29.636 --> 00:18:30.737
I need some water.

354
00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:32.605
You want some water?
Yeah.


355
00:18:32.639 --> 00:18:34.240
I still need to piss.

356
00:18:35.442 --> 00:18:36.108
But sure, okay,

357
00:18:36.142 --> 00:18:37.109
I'll take some water,

358
00:18:37.143 --> 00:18:39.078
but it has to be
sparkling water.


359
00:18:39.111 --> 00:18:41.080
Perrier, Pellegrino,
something like that.


360
00:18:41.113 --> 00:18:43.082
I'll send someone
to take you to piss.


361
00:18:43.115 --> 00:18:45.752
I don't trust the water here.

362
00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.793
So Agent Vanowen...

363
00:18:55.462 --> 00:18:56.262
Fuck, I gotta take a piss!

364
00:18:56.295 --> 00:18:57.295
Come on!

365
00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.131
What do you think?

366
00:19:01.968 --> 00:19:03.770
I mean, shit.

367
00:19:03.803 --> 00:19:04.971
Gotta call the FBI.

368
00:19:05.972 --> 00:19:07.440
Hey, you guys!

369
00:19:07.474 --> 00:19:09.776
You may wanna let the FBI
know about this, huh?!


370
00:19:09.809 --> 00:19:12.612
This shit is going
to blow their minds!


371
00:19:12.645 --> 00:19:14.347
They'll give me a
better deal, huh?


372
00:19:15.348 --> 00:19:16.616
Hello?!

373
00:19:16.649 --> 00:19:18.117
Hello?!

374
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:19.819
- I swear.
- Also,


375
00:19:19.852 --> 00:19:21.320
when you extradite me,

376
00:19:21.354 --> 00:19:23.623
and I'm sure you're going
to want to extradite me,


377
00:19:23.656 --> 00:19:28.661
I want a nice suite in
a flashy boutique hotel.


378
00:19:29.496 --> 00:19:30.797
All right, I'll call the FBI.

379
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:31.998
- Yeah.
- Okay?


380
00:19:33.199 --> 00:19:36.669
Tell them I want a
total immunity agreement


381
00:19:36.703 --> 00:19:38.304
approved by my attorney.

382
00:19:38.337 --> 00:19:39.171
He's in Texas.

383
00:19:39.205 --> 00:19:41.307
I'll give you the number.

384
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.642
Are you there?!

385
00:19:42.675 --> 00:19:43.643
I have to piss!

386
00:19:43.676 --> 00:19:45.978
Yeah, go fuck yourself!

387
00:20:40.399 --> 00:20:43.269
Vanowen.

388
00:20:44.437 --> 00:20:45.437
Yes, sir.

389
00:21:09.295 --> 00:21:10.295
Nick.

390
00:21:13.766 --> 00:21:15.267
Roger that.

391
00:21:15.301 --> 00:21:16.903
Oh.

392
00:21:16.936 --> 00:21:19.405
You got a room number?

393
00:22:05.518 --> 00:22:08.788
All before noon?

394
00:22:08.821 --> 00:22:10.156
Muí bien.

395
00:22:15.194 --> 00:22:16.194
Eh?

396
00:22:18.531 --> 00:22:21.133
No, we don't want.

397
00:22:21.167 --> 00:22:23.670
No, no, no, no.

398
00:22:48.861 --> 00:22:50.362
Let's make it an even 200.

399
00:23:27.233 --> 00:23:28.868
Gracias.

400
00:23:28.901 --> 00:23:30.569
- Hey!
- Hey, what's up?


401
00:23:30.603 --> 00:23:32.404
So the Turk wasn't lying.

402
00:23:32.438 --> 00:23:34.206
FBI got their
panties in a bunch.


403
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.250
I gotta take him to the border.

404
00:23:35.274 --> 00:23:36.242
When?

405
00:23:36.275 --> 00:23:37.409
Right now.

406
00:23:37.443 --> 00:23:39.411
Well, he's technically
not been detained,


407
00:23:39.445 --> 00:23:41.881
so basically, you're
taking him for a car ride.


408
00:23:41.914 --> 00:23:43.716
Yeah, the FBI, they'll
pick him up there.


409
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:44.893
Okay, I'll get you an escort.

410
00:23:44.917 --> 00:23:46.052
No, no, no, I'm good.

411
00:23:46.085 --> 00:23:47.720
No, you should
really take an escort


412
00:23:47.754 --> 00:23:49.221
to get him across the border.

413
00:23:49.255 --> 00:23:50.899
I don't wanna draw any more
attention than I have to.


414
00:23:50.923 --> 00:23:51.924
Okay then.

415
00:25:03.495 --> 00:25:05.297
Hey, chica.

416
00:25:05.331 --> 00:25:07.633
Any chance they could
send us another girl


417
00:25:07.666 --> 00:25:11.804
to work on my legs while you-

418
00:25:11.838 --> 00:25:14.473
I may not get one of
these for a while, huh?


419
00:25:21.848 --> 00:25:24.851
Maybe afterwards, we can
have ourselves a little


420
00:25:25.852 --> 00:25:28.687
Turkish/Mexican ménage à trois?

421
00:25:30.689 --> 00:25:32.859
What say you, darling?

422
00:25:36.195 --> 00:25:38.697
Go low, yeah.

423
00:25:42.534 --> 00:25:45.004
It's time to go, Polat.

424
00:25:45.037 --> 00:25:46.038
No! What?

425
00:25:46.873 --> 00:25:48.174
Come on!

426
00:25:48.207 --> 00:25:49.208
We gotta go.

427
00:25:49.241 --> 00:25:50.241
Why?!

428
00:25:51.878 --> 00:25:53.179
She hasn't even
done my legs yet.


429
00:25:53.212 --> 00:25:54.346
I don't care.

430
00:25:59.886 --> 00:26:01.020
Where is my lawyer?

431
00:26:01.053 --> 00:26:02.855
He's gonna meet
you on US soil, okay?


432
00:26:02.889 --> 00:26:04.523
But we gotta leave
this hotel now, so.


433
00:26:04.556 --> 00:26:05.868
I'm supposed to have
two more days here, man.


434
00:26:05.892 --> 00:26:08.027
The party is over, dickhead.

435
00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.195
Pack up your shit!

436
00:26:09.228 --> 00:26:10.696
Okay, okay!

437
00:26:10.729 --> 00:26:12.231
Every party has a pooper.

438
00:26:19.405 --> 00:26:21.707
Why you in a shit mood
all the time, huh?


439
00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.043
Life is good, man.

440
00:26:24.076 --> 00:26:25.411
You get ulcers.

441
00:26:25.444 --> 00:26:27.379
How 'bout you and I make a deal?

442
00:26:27.413 --> 00:26:29.381
How 'bout you drive me
to the airport instead,


443
00:26:29.415 --> 00:26:31.918
and I give you the password
for my laptop, okay?


444
00:26:31.951 --> 00:26:32.919
I give you the password,

445
00:26:32.952 --> 00:26:34.229
and I will give you the location

446
00:26:34.253 --> 00:26:37.089
of the man who shot your friend.

447
00:26:37.123 --> 00:26:38.390
Come on!

448
00:26:38.424 --> 00:26:39.734
You will have all of
Bin Farri's assets.


449
00:26:39.758 --> 00:26:41.560
You will get his
friends in the scene.


450
00:26:41.593 --> 00:26:42.929
You will get Bin Farri.

451
00:26:45.097 --> 00:26:46.899
Tell them I had a gun on you.

452
00:26:46.933 --> 00:26:47.934
We can make it work!

453
00:26:49.768 --> 00:26:50.903
Come on, man.

454
00:26:50.937 --> 00:26:53.739
I will deposit $5
million for you


455
00:26:53.772 --> 00:26:55.241
in any account in the world.

456
00:26:55.274 --> 00:26:57.076
100% untraceable.

457
00:26:57.109 --> 00:26:58.945
I can do it from
your cell phone.


458
00:27:00.112 --> 00:27:02.281
Give half the money to
the widow, if you want.


459
00:27:02.314 --> 00:27:03.582
I don't care.

460
00:27:06.118 --> 00:27:07.119
I'll make it 10 million,

461
00:27:07.153 --> 00:27:09.588
but we have to act now!

462
00:27:09.621 --> 00:27:10.756
Come on, man.

463
00:27:12.124 --> 00:27:13.092
Let's go.

464
00:27:13.125 --> 00:27:14.093
Let's go.
Come on, man!


465
00:27:14.126 --> 00:27:15.594
Fuckin' hell, man.

466
00:27:18.965 --> 00:27:19.932
Hey, señor, watch it!

467
00:27:19.966 --> 00:27:20.933
Be careful!

468
00:27:20.967 --> 00:27:22.601
That's a $3,000 case, man!

469
00:27:22.634 --> 00:27:24.794
Not a fucking laundry basket!
Get in the fucking car!


470
00:27:30.476 --> 00:27:31.610
Fuck!

471
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.966
No!

472
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.301
Not a fucking fence!

473
00:28:35.041 --> 00:28:36.041
Vanowen.

474
00:28:37.543 --> 00:28:41.680
So his cell phone data shows
that he was at Vista Parallax,


475
00:28:41.713 --> 00:28:44.016
which is a higher-end
looking place.


476
00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:46.518
He was there at least
six times this month.


477
00:28:46.552 --> 00:28:49.021
So we set up a stakeout
across the street.


478
00:28:49.055 --> 00:28:52.058
And since your witness
literally lost his mind,


479
00:28:53.225 --> 00:28:55.061
I thought you might
want to stay occupied


480
00:28:55.094 --> 00:28:57.029
and fill in a hole
in the rotation.


481
00:28:57.063 --> 00:28:58.864
We have eyes on the place.

482
00:28:58.897 --> 00:29:00.566
Okay, I'll give 'em a call.

483
00:29:00.599 --> 00:29:02.534
I already did and
you got approved.


484
00:29:02.568 --> 00:29:04.370
Just as a reinforcement.

485
00:29:04.403 --> 00:29:07.539
This is not a DEA
operation, okay?


486
00:29:07.573 --> 00:29:08.907
Just watch the place.

487
00:29:08.941 --> 00:29:10.742
And it wasn't your
fault, Vanowen.


488
00:29:14.446 --> 00:29:15.714
Live and learn.

489
00:29:15.747 --> 00:29:18.050
Next time, you take
an escort with you.


490
00:30:29.355 --> 00:30:30.289
I'll be right back.

491
00:30:30.322 --> 00:30:31.623
I'm gonna get some audio.

492
00:30:56.348 --> 00:30:57.349
- Hello.
- Hello.


493
00:31:00.352 --> 00:31:02.688
Just one.
Of course.


494
00:31:02.721 --> 00:31:03.721
This way, please.

495
00:31:08.527 --> 00:31:10.829
How do I get over here?

496
00:31:10.862 --> 00:31:12.331
That's the VIP section.

497
00:31:12.364 --> 00:31:14.700
Ahh, how do I become a VIP?

498
00:31:16.068 --> 00:31:18.504
VIPs don't need to
tell anyone they're VIPs.


499
00:31:18.537 --> 00:31:21.006
Okay.

500
00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:22.359
I'll be back to take your order.

501
00:32:26.104 --> 00:32:27.104
Sorry?

502
00:32:31.109 --> 00:32:32.411
Shit!

503
00:32:35.281 --> 00:32:36.282
Do I know you?

504
00:32:36.315 --> 00:32:38.083
No, you don't.

505
00:32:38.116 --> 00:32:40.252
Ah, I'm pretty sure
I've seen you before.


506
00:32:40.286 --> 00:32:41.587
I'm sure you have.

507
00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:44.089
No, the Parallax, right?

508
00:32:44.122 --> 00:32:44.956
How do you know?

509
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:46.758
I've been there a few times.

510
00:32:46.792 --> 00:32:47.759
Seen you around.

511
00:32:47.793 --> 00:32:48.803
I'm usually in the kitchen.

512
00:32:48.827 --> 00:32:49.961
Oh, Anthony.

513
00:32:51.129 --> 00:32:52.631
I still don't remember you.

514
00:32:53.665 --> 00:32:55.133
Can we talk?

515
00:32:55.167 --> 00:32:57.469
Listen, I'm not used to
speed dating at the market.


516
00:32:58.637 --> 00:32:59.781
No, no, I'm not
trying to hit on you.


517
00:32:59.805 --> 00:33:01.115
I was just hoping we
could talk in private,


518
00:33:01.139 --> 00:33:03.942
so I don't get into trouble.

519
00:33:03.975 --> 00:33:04.975
Por favor?

520
00:33:05.844 --> 00:33:06.844
Come on.

521
00:33:10.349 --> 00:33:11.950
I have nothing
to do with the business


522
00:33:11.983 --> 00:33:14.320
or anything that goes on there.

523
00:33:14.353 --> 00:33:16.121
I just make food.

524
00:33:16.154 --> 00:33:18.123
No, I know.

525
00:33:18.156 --> 00:33:18.990
I know.

526
00:33:19.024 --> 00:33:21.126
So what do you want from me?

527
00:33:21.159 --> 00:33:23.295
- What's your name?
- Mina.


528
00:33:23.329 --> 00:33:24.996
Mina, Mina, that's nice.

529
00:33:26.498 --> 00:33:28.800
I got a big favor
to ask from you.


530
00:33:28.834 --> 00:33:30.302
From me?

531
00:33:30.336 --> 00:33:33.004
Yeah, I need you to place this

532
00:33:33.038 --> 00:33:35.807
underneath the VIP
table at the Parallax.


533
00:33:35.841 --> 00:33:37.676
No!

534
00:33:38.677 --> 00:33:39.978
Why?

535
00:33:40.011 --> 00:33:41.811
It's for an investigation
the DEA's running.


536
00:33:42.881 --> 00:33:44.650
Are they selling drugs in there?

537
00:33:44.683 --> 00:33:46.318
Fuck!
Maybe.


538
00:33:46.352 --> 00:33:48.687
Are you gonna be
shutting down the Parallax?


539
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.855
Why?

540
00:33:49.888 --> 00:33:51.657
So I can start
looking for another job.


541
00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:53.158
No, no, no, I...

542
00:33:53.191 --> 00:33:53.992
Gosh.

543
00:33:54.025 --> 00:33:54.993
I don't know, okay?

544
00:33:55.026 --> 00:33:56.528
But I doubt the people involved

545
00:33:56.562 --> 00:33:58.340
have anything to do with
the actual business, okay?


546
00:33:58.364 --> 00:34:00.832
But there's only
one way to find out.


547
00:34:00.866 --> 00:34:03.535
I mean, no one would
ever know it was you.


548
00:34:03.569 --> 00:34:05.671
There's lots of cameras.

549
00:34:05.704 --> 00:34:07.005
Just stick it under the table.

550
00:34:07.038 --> 00:34:08.038
That's all.

551
00:34:11.577 --> 00:34:12.711
What's in it for me?

552
00:34:14.246 --> 00:34:15.847
Come on!

553
00:34:15.881 --> 00:34:17.349
This'll take you
like 10 seconds.


554
00:34:17.383 --> 00:34:19.060
I don't know, that
expression on your face


555
00:34:19.084 --> 00:34:21.353
tells me this is
a buyer's market.


556
00:34:21.387 --> 00:34:23.855
Am I the buyer or the seller?

557
00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:25.691
You are the seller.

558
00:34:25.724 --> 00:34:26.858
Okay.

559
00:34:26.892 --> 00:34:27.893
How about this?

560
00:34:29.728 --> 00:34:31.530
I do this thing for you,

561
00:34:31.563 --> 00:34:33.532
and then we get married,

562
00:34:33.565 --> 00:34:34.700
so I can get a green card,

563
00:34:34.733 --> 00:34:36.402
so I can join the CIA.

564
00:34:37.569 --> 00:34:40.205
You wanna join the CIA?

565
00:34:40.238 --> 00:34:43.041
The Culinary
Institute of America.


566
00:34:43.074 --> 00:34:44.410
It's in New York.

567
00:34:44.443 --> 00:34:47.045
Best cooking school in the US.

568
00:34:47.078 --> 00:34:48.880
Wow! Okay.

569
00:34:48.914 --> 00:34:50.582
Let me think about that.

570
00:34:50.616 --> 00:34:53.218
Did not plan on getting
married anytime soon.


571
00:34:53.251 --> 00:34:54.251
I'm just kidding.

572
00:34:55.421 --> 00:34:56.722
You're not even my type.

573
00:34:56.755 --> 00:34:58.390
Ouch!

574
00:34:58.424 --> 00:34:59.925
Gotta go to work now.

575
00:35:12.103 --> 00:35:13.238
I'll do it,

576
00:35:13.271 --> 00:35:14.640
but you will owe me one.

577
00:35:17.943 --> 00:35:18.744
Of course.

578
00:35:18.777 --> 00:35:20.412
Don't tell anyone.

579
00:35:20.446 --> 00:35:22.614
If I get fired, it's
gonna be your fault.


580
00:35:23.482 --> 00:35:25.250
Fair enough.

581
00:35:25.283 --> 00:35:28.253
You know, when you were talking
to me back at the market,


582
00:35:28.286 --> 00:35:29.955
before I knew you
were a law man,


583
00:35:31.122 --> 00:35:32.824
I actually thought
it was my lucky day.


584
00:36:13.665 --> 00:36:15.333
All right, here she goes.

585
00:36:35.854 --> 00:36:36.854
Hell yeah!

586
00:36:47.399 --> 00:36:48.667
Yeah.

587
00:37:49.427 --> 00:37:50.896
Hey, let me get that.

588
00:37:56.101 --> 00:37:57.068
How are you doing, my friend?

589
00:37:57.102 --> 00:37:58.236
- Good, how are you?
- Good.


590
00:37:58.269 --> 00:38:00.238
Welcome to Tijuana.
Thank you.


591
00:38:14.953 --> 00:38:16.087
Do you enjoy hookahs?

592
00:38:16.121 --> 00:38:18.757
Thank you, but
I prefer to work first.


593
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:19.925
Everything okay?

594
00:38:19.958 --> 00:38:22.761
That's why you're here.

595
00:38:22.794 --> 00:38:24.262
So tell me, Fernando,

596
00:38:24.295 --> 00:38:25.931
how come you cost
me so much money


597
00:38:25.964 --> 00:38:27.633
after I pay for everything else?

598
00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.268
Let me see it.

599
00:38:30.301 --> 00:38:31.269
Where is it?

600
00:38:31.302 --> 00:38:32.771
Do you have payment?

601
00:38:32.804 --> 00:38:34.606
Half as agreed now,

602
00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.475
the rest after it's installed.

603
00:38:49.154 --> 00:38:50.789
So want a hit?

604
00:38:50.822 --> 00:38:52.290
The machine's hardwired

605
00:38:52.323 --> 00:38:54.960
to a local cellular network.

606
00:38:54.993 --> 00:38:55.993
No, no!

607
00:38:56.828 --> 00:38:59.965
Where the fuck are they goin'?

608
00:39:28.193 --> 00:39:29.695
Watch out there.

609
00:39:48.379 --> 00:39:50.081
What the hell is that, guys?

610
00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:53.685
Come on!

611
00:40:08.066 --> 00:40:09.066
All right.

612
00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.541
I can't believe it.

613
00:40:16.574 --> 00:40:17.574
It's all here.

614
00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.882
Easier than take-out.

615
00:40:23.915 --> 00:40:25.751
Please, try it yourself.

616
00:40:34.259 --> 00:40:35.060
Motherfucker!

617
00:40:35.093 --> 00:40:36.394
Come on!

618
00:40:40.766 --> 00:40:42.286
It's just
like changing a TV channel.


619
00:40:51.777 --> 00:40:53.078
But next time,

620
00:40:53.111 --> 00:40:54.946
it could be the
entire power grid


621
00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.448
on the east side of
the United States.


622
00:40:58.616 --> 00:40:59.918
So we're done here then?

623
00:40:59.951 --> 00:41:01.419
Congratulations.

624
00:41:01.452 --> 00:41:02.253
Are we still on for tomorrow?

625
00:41:02.287 --> 00:41:03.288
Of course.

626
00:41:04.956 --> 00:41:06.091
Let's eat then.

627
00:41:11.963 --> 00:41:13.264
Who's there?

628
00:41:22.173 --> 00:41:23.608
- Let him shoot!
- Yeah, follow me!


629
00:41:23.641 --> 00:41:25.443
Let's go!

630
00:41:40.325 --> 00:41:45.330
What the fuck?

631
00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:53.471
DEA, freeze!

632
00:42:13.524 --> 00:42:15.360
DEA, drop the weapon!

633
00:42:17.028 --> 00:42:18.028
Drop it.

634
00:42:21.532 --> 00:42:23.501
Fuck!

635
00:44:01.632 --> 00:44:02.433
What happened?

636
00:44:02.467 --> 00:44:03.935
Yeah, you shouldn't be here.

637
00:44:03.969 --> 00:44:05.470
What did you do?

638
00:44:05.503 --> 00:44:06.938
Me?! Nothin'.

639
00:44:06.972 --> 00:44:09.107
- Is this because of the-
- No, no, no, no.


640
00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:10.441
Definitely not.

641
00:44:18.816 --> 00:44:20.785
Was he actually here?

642
00:44:20.818 --> 00:44:21.987
Yeah, yeah.

643
00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:22.954
No, someone knew
he'd be here, so.


644
00:44:22.988 --> 00:44:24.789
Right under our fucking noses?

645
00:44:24.822 --> 00:44:25.822
Yep.

646
00:44:28.159 --> 00:44:29.159
Well...

647
00:44:30.495 --> 00:44:32.497
So that's Zico, for sure.

648
00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:33.798
Yeah.

649
00:44:33.831 --> 00:44:35.867
And the other guy
there was Bin Farri.


650
00:44:38.003 --> 00:44:39.804
These guys are like bodyguards,

651
00:44:39.837 --> 00:44:42.673
and who the fuck is the cowboy?

652
00:44:42.707 --> 00:44:44.642
The other ones, I don't
know who they are.


653
00:44:44.675 --> 00:44:47.979
Yeah, we lost power a few times.

654
00:44:48.013 --> 00:44:51.816
Yeah, the whole city
went dark twice last night


655
00:44:51.849 --> 00:44:53.318
without no reason.

656
00:44:53.351 --> 00:44:54.528
Wait, wait, the entire city?

657
00:44:54.552 --> 00:44:55.853
The entire city.

658
00:44:58.356 --> 00:44:59.991
All right, you know what?

659
00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:03.328
The camera had a battery.

660
00:45:03.361 --> 00:45:05.196
I bet it recorded everything.

661
00:45:22.713 --> 00:45:23.881
Fuck off!

662
00:45:24.749 --> 00:45:25.749
It was them.

663
00:45:27.552 --> 00:45:28.553
Holy shit!

664
00:45:30.388 --> 00:45:31.722
Oh, this can't be good.

665
00:45:31.756 --> 00:45:35.026
No, I mean, if you
think that's bad, I bet...


666
00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.362
Shit, man, I bet that
was just a rehearsal.


667
00:45:37.395 --> 00:45:38.395
Fuck!

668
00:45:40.565 --> 00:45:41.565
Yeah.

669
00:45:58.583 --> 00:46:00.718
Okay, here it is.

670
00:46:00.751 --> 00:46:01.751
Where do you want it?

671
00:46:05.756 --> 00:46:07.258
I have something to show you.

672
00:46:08.593 --> 00:46:10.595
I will transfer the
money right away.


673
00:46:10.628 --> 00:46:13.064
I need the money
you already owed me.


674
00:46:13.098 --> 00:46:14.065
What money?

675
00:46:14.099 --> 00:46:15.900
Your guys showed me the money,

676
00:46:15.933 --> 00:46:17.902
then I demonstrated
the system to you.


677
00:46:17.935 --> 00:46:19.437
Suddenly, I was being shot at.

678
00:46:20.938 --> 00:46:22.773
It seems that the
money is missing,


679
00:46:22.807 --> 00:46:24.609
but don't worry, we
will make it up to you.


680
00:46:24.642 --> 00:46:25.786
Look, I just want my money,

681
00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:27.112
and I'm out of here, okay?

682
00:46:28.113 --> 00:46:29.114
Please follow me.

683
00:46:35.786 --> 00:46:36.797
Khalil was going to
do the work here.


684
00:46:36.821 --> 00:46:38.589
Now, you must do it.

685
00:46:38.623 --> 00:46:39.424
Me? No.

686
00:46:39.457 --> 00:46:40.258
No fucking way!

687
00:46:40.291 --> 00:46:41.259
I made what you wanted,

688
00:46:41.292 --> 00:46:42.593
I am delivering what you wanted,

689
00:46:42.627 --> 00:46:44.095
and I showed you that it works.

690
00:46:44.129 --> 00:46:46.597
I did my job and I
need to be paid now.


691
00:46:46.631 --> 00:46:48.433
What can I offer you
to change your mind?


692
00:46:48.466 --> 00:46:49.943
I watched my cousin
get killed because of you.


693
00:46:49.967 --> 00:46:52.603
I'll give you three
times what we agreed.


694
00:46:52.637 --> 00:46:53.637
$30 million?

695
00:46:56.307 --> 00:46:57.775
As long as you give me your word

696
00:46:57.808 --> 00:47:00.145
that you will stay
until the job is done,


697
00:47:02.647 --> 00:47:04.115
I'll do it right now.

698
00:47:13.491 --> 00:47:14.491
50 million.

699
00:47:15.826 --> 00:47:17.128
50?

700
00:47:17.162 --> 00:47:18.963
Before you fuck up
the global economy,


701
00:47:18.996 --> 00:47:20.531
I'd like to have some security.

702
00:47:25.036 --> 00:47:27.138
How long will it take?

703
00:47:27.172 --> 00:47:28.306
A day or two,

704
00:47:28.339 --> 00:47:30.141
plus whatever the code
takes to propagate


705
00:47:30.175 --> 00:47:31.509
all over the internet.

706
00:47:34.512 --> 00:47:35.646
Okay.

707
00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:36.680
Okay.

708
00:48:38.743 --> 00:48:39.710
Stunning.

709
00:48:39.744 --> 00:48:40.878
Thank you so much for...

710
00:48:40.911 --> 00:48:41.712
You making it here

711
00:48:41.746 --> 00:48:44.081
is a completely
- Hi.

712
00:48:45.082 --> 00:48:46.551
Anthony Vanowen.

713
00:48:46.584 --> 00:48:47.385
Rashida Bin Farri.

714
00:48:47.418 --> 00:48:48.886
It's a pleasure to meet you.

715
00:48:48.919 --> 00:48:51.722
Is there somewhere we
could speak in private?


716
00:48:51.756 --> 00:48:52.756
About what?

717
00:48:53.591 --> 00:48:55.426
- Hussein Bin Farri.
- My uncle?


718
00:48:56.794 --> 00:48:58.463
Why don't you talk
to him yourself?


719
00:49:00.431 --> 00:49:02.733
Actually, I'd
rather speak with you.


720
00:49:02.767 --> 00:49:03.901
Excuse me.

721
00:49:03.934 --> 00:49:05.236
Are you police?

722
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:06.270
DEA.

723
00:49:07.605 --> 00:49:08.906
DEA.

724
00:49:08.939 --> 00:49:10.074
Do you think my uncle,

725
00:49:10.107 --> 00:49:12.410
who's funded most
of this institution,


726
00:49:12.443 --> 00:49:14.412
is somehow involved
in illegal narcotics?


727
00:49:14.445 --> 00:49:16.247
No, it's not about that.

728
00:49:16.281 --> 00:49:17.748
- Good evening, sir.
- Hi.


729
00:49:17.782 --> 00:49:19.417
Hope you're enjoying yourself?

730
00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:21.118
- Absolutely.
- Hmmm.


731
00:49:22.653 --> 00:49:24.131
Mina, my darling,
would you make sure


732
00:49:24.155 --> 00:49:26.591
everyone has champagne
by the end of my speech?


733
00:49:26.624 --> 00:49:27.425
Of course.

734
00:49:27.458 --> 00:49:29.960
Excuse me.

735
00:49:29.994 --> 00:49:31.296
Excuse me, I have to go.

736
00:49:31.329 --> 00:49:32.463
Is there any way...

737
00:49:32.497 --> 00:49:33.774
It's very important
that we speak.


738
00:49:33.798 --> 00:49:35.099
I have to go.

739
00:49:35.132 --> 00:49:36.301
Call my office.

740
00:50:45.035 --> 00:50:46.504
Sure.

741
00:50:47.872 --> 00:50:49.540
That's the same guy
who tried to stop us


742
00:50:49.574 --> 00:50:51.342
outside the Parallax.

743
00:50:51.376 --> 00:50:53.678
Our
guests of honor for the night.


744
00:50:53.711 --> 00:50:54.679
The shooter?

745
00:50:54.712 --> 00:50:56.180
- Has to have been.
- No.


746
00:50:56.213 --> 00:50:57.548
I've seen him before.

747
00:50:58.383 --> 00:51:00.184
He's DEA.

748
00:51:00.217 --> 00:51:02.052
He was outside the
San Mar warehouse.


749
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:08.559
Did you know the DEA
had a history with San Mar


750
00:51:08.593 --> 00:51:09.594
before we bought it?

751
00:51:10.728 --> 00:51:11.862
No.

752
00:51:13.564 --> 00:51:14.699
So you didn't know

753
00:51:14.732 --> 00:51:16.734
that the San Mar
brothers smuggled drugs?


754
00:51:18.235 --> 00:51:19.370
No.

755
00:51:19.404 --> 00:51:20.738
Then why is the DEA up my ass?!

756
00:51:24.575 --> 00:51:26.744
Go do something about it.

757
00:51:28.245 --> 00:51:30.381
Make sure it's him.

758
00:51:34.585 --> 00:51:35.886
That's the guy!

759
00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:39.424
I know it's him.

760
00:52:32.142 --> 00:52:33.142
Shit!

761
00:52:37.815 --> 00:52:38.815
Gracias.

762
00:52:42.152 --> 00:52:44.154
Are you gonna follow me again?

763
00:52:45.322 --> 00:52:46.500
What are you doin' out here?

764
00:52:46.524 --> 00:52:47.825
I'm done for the night.

765
00:52:49.494 --> 00:52:50.795
You happen to see a old guy

766
00:52:50.828 --> 00:52:53.964
come out here,
like, seconds ago?


767
00:52:53.998 --> 00:52:55.366
You mean the guy in the Jeep?

768
00:52:56.501 --> 00:52:57.835
Old guy?

769
00:52:57.868 --> 00:52:58.969
That's him right now.

770
00:52:59.003 --> 00:53:00.004
He just left.

771
00:53:05.209 --> 00:53:06.644
Shit!

772
00:53:06.677 --> 00:53:07.978
Is this you?
Mmhmm.


773
00:53:08.012 --> 00:53:09.480
Go ahead, get in.

774
00:53:10.681 --> 00:53:12.316
We're gonna follow him.

775
00:53:18.523 --> 00:53:19.990
Did you catch him smoking weed

776
00:53:20.024 --> 00:53:21.358
in the bathroom or something?

777
00:53:21.392 --> 00:53:22.392
What? No, no!

778
00:53:23.528 --> 00:53:24.862
Why are we following him?

779
00:53:30.535 --> 00:53:31.669
Come on!

780
00:53:31.702 --> 00:53:32.670
Look, look,
You're gonna lose him.


781
00:53:32.703 --> 00:53:34.338
You wanted me to follow him,

782
00:53:34.371 --> 00:53:35.873
I'm following him.

783
00:53:37.207 --> 00:53:38.543
You should turn the lights off.

784
00:53:38.576 --> 00:53:40.344
You're getting a
little too pushy, okay?


785
00:53:40.377 --> 00:53:41.546
I don't like that.

786
00:53:43.047 --> 00:53:43.848
Look, I'm sorry.

787
00:53:43.881 --> 00:53:44.682
I just...

788
00:53:44.715 --> 00:53:46.350
I cannot lose him.

789
00:53:46.383 --> 00:53:47.518
Happy?

790
00:53:47.552 --> 00:53:48.586
I can't see anything.

791
00:53:49.887 --> 00:53:51.021
Your eyes will adjust.

792
00:53:51.055 --> 00:53:52.389
By the time my eyes adjust

793
00:53:52.423 --> 00:53:54.224
we're gonna be
wrapped around a pole.


794
00:53:55.225 --> 00:53:56.225
Wow.

795
00:54:00.931 --> 00:54:02.066
So now what?

796
00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:06.270
What did he do?

797
00:54:07.738 --> 00:54:08.873
Okay.

798
00:54:08.906 --> 00:54:11.375
I mean, I guess I could
tell you.


799
00:54:11.408 --> 00:54:13.711
I think that guy-
No, no, no, no, no.


800
00:54:13.744 --> 00:54:14.912
Wait, wait, wait, no.

801
00:54:14.945 --> 00:54:16.881
I don't wanna know.

802
00:54:16.914 --> 00:54:19.550
I just changed my mind,
just like right now.


803
00:54:19.584 --> 00:54:20.751
Don't tell me anything.

804
00:54:20.785 --> 00:54:22.386
Don't you tell me anything,

805
00:54:22.419 --> 00:54:23.897
because I don't wanna have
to testify about anything.


806
00:54:23.921 --> 00:54:25.389
Nevermind.

807
00:54:25.422 --> 00:54:27.925
I'm sorry if
any of this scared you, or...


808
00:54:30.761 --> 00:54:31.761
Scared me?

809
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:34.632
What is wrong with you?

810
00:54:36.266 --> 00:54:37.434
Nothing.

811
00:54:37.468 --> 00:54:39.079
It's just the way you're
lookin' at me right now


812
00:54:39.103 --> 00:54:41.772
is making me think, I
don't know, maybe...


813
00:54:48.445 --> 00:54:50.080
So what's next?

814
00:54:50.114 --> 00:54:51.582
I'll help.

815
00:54:51.616 --> 00:54:54.585
Even if it's just another
little job like the microphone,


816
00:54:54.619 --> 00:54:55.753
that was fun.

817
00:54:55.786 --> 00:54:57.454
Another job?

818
00:54:57.488 --> 00:54:58.756
Another bug?

819
00:54:58.789 --> 00:54:59.824
Secret camera?

820
00:55:00.958 --> 00:55:02.092
In "Breaking Bad",

821
00:55:02.126 --> 00:55:04.629
he puts that GPS
thingie by the tire.


822
00:55:04.662 --> 00:55:06.263
I can do that.

823
00:55:06.296 --> 00:55:07.774
Do you want me to put
one of those thingies


824
00:55:07.798 --> 00:55:09.266
on the Jeep's tire?

825
00:55:09.299 --> 00:55:13.103
No, no, I don't want you
to put any thingie anywhere.


826
00:55:13.137 --> 00:55:15.773
I just fucking tailed someone!

827
00:55:15.806 --> 00:55:17.775
This is so cool!

828
00:55:17.808 --> 00:55:20.277
So technically
speaking, what am I,


829
00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:24.148
a DEA, a CI, an informant?

830
00:55:25.182 --> 00:55:26.483
Listen, Mina.

831
00:55:28.352 --> 00:55:30.120
You did me a huge favor,

832
00:55:30.154 --> 00:55:33.490
and then you did me another
favor, and I appreciate that,


833
00:55:33.524 --> 00:55:34.959
and I owe you one,

834
00:55:34.992 --> 00:55:37.294
but there are no more jobs.

835
00:55:37.327 --> 00:55:38.829
Fine!

836
00:55:40.998 --> 00:55:42.166
So, now what?

837
00:55:43.167 --> 00:55:44.167
Take you back?

838
00:55:47.838 --> 00:55:48.839
How 'bout a drink?

839
00:55:51.341 --> 00:55:52.977
I know the perfect place.

840
00:56:10.194 --> 00:56:11.829
What's that?

841
00:56:11.862 --> 00:56:13.497
Do you care?

842
00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:15.332
No, I don't care.

843
00:56:22.372 --> 00:56:23.540
So what's your story?

844
00:56:24.709 --> 00:56:26.010
My story?

845
00:56:26.043 --> 00:56:26.844
Where did you grow up?

846
00:56:26.877 --> 00:56:27.912
Fort Wayne, Indiana.

847
00:56:29.546 --> 00:56:30.881
Raised by my grandparents.

848
00:56:31.882 --> 00:56:32.882
How come?

849
00:56:35.052 --> 00:56:37.554
My mom died when I was a kid.

850
00:56:39.556 --> 00:56:42.893
My dad, he took me
to live with them.


851
00:56:43.761 --> 00:56:45.362
Sorry.

852
00:56:45.395 --> 00:56:47.231
It was a long time ago.

853
00:56:47.264 --> 00:56:50.100
So your dad just left you there?

854
00:56:51.736 --> 00:56:52.736
Yeah.

855
00:56:53.738 --> 00:56:56.040
You don't abandon your kid.

856
00:56:56.073 --> 00:56:57.241
You just don't.

857
00:57:01.912 --> 00:57:04.081
When did you learn
to speak English?


858
00:57:05.249 --> 00:57:06.717
This is Tijuana.

859
00:57:06.751 --> 00:57:07.918
Learn or starve.

860
00:57:09.253 --> 00:57:11.555
Your Spanish is not bad.

861
00:57:11.588 --> 00:57:13.223
A little chunky.

862
00:57:13.257 --> 00:57:14.925
- Chunky.
- But cute.


863
00:57:18.295 --> 00:57:20.397
Thought I wasn't your type?

864
00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:21.598
You're not.

865
00:57:43.287 --> 00:57:44.254
This is me.

866
00:57:44.288 --> 00:57:45.790
Thank you.

867
00:59:37.401 --> 00:59:40.704
Morning, sir.
Mornin'.


868
00:59:40.737 --> 00:59:42.072
Driver's license, please.

869
00:59:45.442 --> 00:59:48.913
You're a little out of your
jurisdiction, aren't ya, son?


870
00:59:52.082 --> 00:59:53.717
Here you go.

871
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:55.085
Where you goin'?

872
00:59:55.119 --> 00:59:57.788
Oh, over to the mercado,
get some groceries.


873
01:00:02.759 --> 01:00:04.094
Did I do something wrong?

874
01:00:05.295 --> 01:00:06.563
I'm not a traffic cop.

875
01:00:06.596 --> 01:00:08.065
DEA.

876
01:00:08.098 --> 01:00:09.800
Special Agent Anthony Vanowen.

877
01:00:13.938 --> 01:00:15.105
Hi, Dad.

878
01:00:17.774 --> 01:00:18.575
Have a seat.

879
01:00:18.608 --> 01:00:19.643
Can I get you somethin'?

880
01:00:21.111 --> 01:00:23.613
Yeah, I'll take
a beer, if you have any?


881
01:00:23.647 --> 01:00:24.781
Got that.

882
01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.789
There you go.

883
01:00:45.836 --> 01:00:46.836
What?

884
01:00:49.473 --> 01:00:50.507
I don't know, I'm...

885
01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:54.811
I'm just lookin'
at ya, and you...


886
01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:57.281
You're a man.

887
01:00:57.314 --> 01:00:58.314
You've grown up.

888
01:00:59.816 --> 01:01:00.985
You look so different.

889
01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.622
Like, how
many years has it been?


890
01:01:05.655 --> 01:01:06.655
Jesus!

891
01:01:11.328 --> 01:01:12.997
I guess I owe you
an explanation.


892
01:01:14.498 --> 01:01:16.366
You think so, do you?

893
01:01:17.834 --> 01:01:21.638
You remember when you
and I drove from Cincinnati


894
01:01:21.671 --> 01:01:23.307
up to Chicago to see the Cubs?

895
01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:24.474
The day my mom died?

896
01:01:24.508 --> 01:01:26.310
Yeah, I remember that.

897
01:01:26.343 --> 01:01:29.013
And that man that
killed your mom


898
01:01:31.181 --> 01:01:32.849
was, in fact, trying to kill me.

899
01:01:35.352 --> 01:01:36.520
Wait.

900
01:01:36.553 --> 01:01:38.022
No.

901
01:01:38.055 --> 01:01:40.490
Wait, Why would
anyone wanna kill you?


902
01:01:40.524 --> 01:01:41.658
The year before,

903
01:01:41.691 --> 01:01:45.029
I filled his hotel room
with carbon monoxide,


904
01:01:45.862 --> 01:01:50.334
and it killed his wife, his son,

905
01:01:50.367 --> 01:01:52.402
his daughter, and his father.

906
01:01:54.704 --> 01:01:55.704
Everyone.

907
01:02:00.377 --> 01:02:01.845
And he wasn't even there.

908
01:02:01.878 --> 01:02:03.847
He was supposed to be,
but he wasn't even there.


909
01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.349
And you told me you were...

910
01:02:05.382 --> 01:02:06.516
What was it?

911
01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:08.061
An industrial lubricant
salesman, right?


912
01:02:08.085 --> 01:02:09.686
You traveled across the world

913
01:02:09.719 --> 01:02:11.721
all the time.
No, my job


914
01:02:11.755 --> 01:02:15.359
was with a shadow
agency of the NSA,


915
01:02:15.392 --> 01:02:18.728
and it was my job to
execute black warrants


916
01:02:18.762 --> 01:02:20.864
and kill enemies of the state.

917
01:02:20.897 --> 01:02:25.202
You just kill people
for a living, that's all.


918
01:02:25.235 --> 01:02:26.546
You know, when you
put it like that,


919
01:02:26.570 --> 01:02:29.039
it doesn't sound so
good, but it was my job.


920
01:02:29.073 --> 01:02:30.073
It's not great.

921
01:02:32.276 --> 01:02:34.044
I decided it was
time to let you go,


922
01:02:34.078 --> 01:02:36.880
and I knew one
day you'd move on.


923
01:02:36.913 --> 01:02:40.050
You'd get married and
have kids of your own,


924
01:02:40.084 --> 01:02:42.552
and I would never
get to meet them,


925
01:02:42.586 --> 01:02:45.755
and that was painful for me.

926
01:02:47.591 --> 01:02:50.094
I got a lot of regrets.

927
01:02:51.428 --> 01:02:56.133
The one regret that I never
allowed myself to have


928
01:02:57.601 --> 01:02:59.303
was the decision to protect you.

929
01:03:01.938 --> 01:03:02.938
Yeah, okay.

930
01:03:07.144 --> 01:03:08.144
Tony?

931
01:03:11.281 --> 01:03:13.117
I will be here if
you wanna talk.


932
01:03:15.452 --> 01:03:16.452
Yeah, sure.

933
01:03:17.654 --> 01:03:18.654
Yeah.

934
01:03:38.975 --> 01:03:39.975
Tony?

935
01:03:41.145 --> 01:03:42.146
Tony, Tony?

936
01:03:44.648 --> 01:03:45.648
Take this.

937
01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:48.452
If you need to
talk, just call me.


938
01:03:48.485 --> 01:03:49.853
Dial direct, one.

939
01:03:51.655 --> 01:03:53.623
Yeah, I'll call you.

940
01:03:53.657 --> 01:03:54.657
Please.

941
01:03:59.196 --> 01:04:00.297
Hey!

942
01:04:02.499 --> 01:04:06.136
No!

943
01:05:03.427 --> 01:05:06.563
How much longer?

944
01:05:06.596 --> 01:05:08.365
I'd say about 24 hours.

945
01:05:14.104 --> 01:05:18.208
Okay.

946
01:05:36.293 --> 01:05:38.262
Must be cheating on someone.

947
01:05:38.295 --> 01:05:40.397
Two phones.

948
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:41.430
I know.

949
01:05:42.266 --> 01:05:45.435
Let me ask you, 
Agent Vanowen,

950
01:05:46.436 --> 01:05:47.436
have we met before?

951
01:05:48.438 --> 01:05:50.740
Then what is it?

952
01:05:50.774 --> 01:05:53.743
What is it that I
did to piss you off?


953
01:05:53.777 --> 01:05:55.111
Why are you in my life?

954
01:05:57.147 --> 01:05:59.449
How the fuck should I
know who you are, huh?


955
01:06:01.117 --> 01:06:04.120
You were at my
warehouse messing around.


956
01:06:04.154 --> 01:06:06.423
Then the other night, you
tried to stop my vehicle


957
01:06:06.456 --> 01:06:08.325
after somebody tried
to assassinate me!


958
01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:11.295
What am I to think?!

959
01:06:11.328 --> 01:06:12.762
I don't know.

960
01:06:12.796 --> 01:06:14.106
Why don't you ask your
trigger-happy friend here?


961
01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:16.600
He's the one that
killed my partner.


962
01:06:16.633 --> 01:06:17.633
Yeah, I see you.

963
01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:26.109
What happened to Polat?

964
01:06:26.142 --> 01:06:27.611
What happened?!

965
01:06:27.644 --> 01:06:29.946
He put a bullet in his head!

966
01:06:29.979 --> 01:06:31.615
That's not true.

967
01:06:31.648 --> 01:06:32.782
I was there.

968
01:06:32.816 --> 01:06:34.651
What did Polat tell you?

969
01:06:37.854 --> 01:06:40.123
What is it that you want, huh?

970
01:06:43.159 --> 01:06:44.461
Uh-oh.

971
01:06:44.494 --> 01:06:46.996
Yeah, I learned that from-

972
01:06:50.033 --> 01:06:53.470
Wait, does that
not mean pepperoni pizza?


973
01:06:55.839 --> 01:06:56.806
Know what?

974
01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.342
Now, I just wanna kill you.

975
01:07:11.187 --> 01:07:12.322
Hey, what?!

976
01:07:20.697 --> 01:07:21.998
What is going on?

977
01:07:32.242 --> 01:07:33.710
Fuck you!

978
01:07:36.746 --> 01:07:39.883
They could be tracking him.

979
01:07:47.724 --> 01:07:48.724
Hello?

980
01:07:52.562 --> 01:07:53.562
It's for you.

981
01:07:55.899 --> 01:07:56.933
Bin Farri?

982
01:07:58.067 --> 01:07:59.703
Who is this?

983
01:07:59.736 --> 01:08:02.372
Someone who knows you very well.

984
01:08:02.406 --> 01:08:05.575
It's been over 20
years since Miami.


985
01:08:07.076 --> 01:08:08.076
It's you.

986
01:08:09.078 --> 01:08:10.246
It all makes sense now.

987
01:08:13.583 --> 01:08:17.253
You used this DEA agent
as bait to find me.


988
01:08:18.254 --> 01:08:19.254
Clever.

989
01:08:20.089 --> 01:08:22.559
Why weren't you in Miami?

990
01:08:22.592 --> 01:08:24.561
Your family was there, but no,

991
01:08:24.594 --> 01:08:26.896
you were in some hotel
with your mistress.


992
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:28.898
We all have regrets.

993
01:08:28.932 --> 01:08:31.435
How did you find
out about my son?


994
01:08:32.436 --> 01:08:33.236
Son?

995
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:34.404
Anthony!

996
01:08:34.438 --> 01:08:35.572
Who else?

997
01:08:35.605 --> 01:08:37.607
Anthony Vanowen is your son?

998
01:08:38.608 --> 01:08:40.076
Let him go.

999
01:08:40.109 --> 01:08:42.078
That's not going to happen.

1000
01:08:51.621 --> 01:08:52.589
What, big man?

1001
01:08:52.622 --> 01:08:54.257
You can't kill a DEA agent.

1002
01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:55.625
Everyone can be killed.

1003
01:08:56.626 --> 01:08:57.626
Bring it.

1004
01:08:58.795 --> 01:09:01.431
Bring what?

1005
01:09:23.853 --> 01:09:25.955
That door was
supposed to be locked!


1006
01:09:25.989 --> 01:09:26.956
He's the fuckin' janitor.

1007
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.824
He has keys to everything.

1008
01:09:27.857 --> 01:09:29.292
It was locked.

1009
01:09:29.325 --> 01:09:32.462
What's this?

1010
01:09:32.496 --> 01:09:33.830
I'll check the main power.

1011
01:09:35.164 --> 01:09:36.132
Was that you, Fernando?

1012
01:09:36.165 --> 01:09:38.001
Of course not.

1013
01:10:00.056 --> 01:10:01.056
Qué pasa?

1014
01:10:11.701 --> 01:10:13.503
Took you long enough.

1015
01:10:13.537 --> 01:10:15.371
Well, I'm here now.

1016
01:10:19.876 --> 01:10:22.011
Time to go home, Son.

1017
01:10:29.886 --> 01:10:30.886
Come on!

1018
01:10:36.059 --> 01:10:38.528
Vámonos!

1019
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:08.057
Captain?

1020
01:12:02.345 --> 01:12:03.613
Is this their Wi
-Fi?

1021
01:12:24.333 --> 01:12:26.002
That was pretty amazing.

1022
01:12:27.036 --> 01:12:28.304
Nah.

1023
01:12:28.337 --> 01:12:30.173
That was you at
the Parallax, huh?


1024
01:12:31.708 --> 01:12:32.842
Uh-huh.

1025
01:12:32.876 --> 01:12:34.476
Pretty sure you
almost killed me there.


1026
01:12:35.845 --> 01:12:39.482
You know, I was
just thinkin' about that.


1027
01:12:39.515 --> 01:12:40.984
Yeah.

1028
01:12:41.017 --> 01:12:42.686
And it's a good
thing you told me


1029
01:12:42.719 --> 01:12:46.522
you were with the DEA,
or otherwise, who knows?


1030
01:12:48.024 --> 01:12:50.727
Jesus!

1031
01:13:09.545 --> 01:13:12.515
Oh, shit.

1032
01:13:12.548 --> 01:13:15.685
Fuck.

1033
01:13:20.724 --> 01:13:23.359
You sleep down below.

1034
01:13:23.392 --> 01:13:24.560
I'll take up top.

1035
01:13:25.895 --> 01:13:27.030
Take a shower.

1036
01:13:27.063 --> 01:13:29.032
It'll probably make
you feel better.


1037
01:13:29.065 --> 01:13:31.701
Yeah.

1038
01:13:31.735 --> 01:13:32.736
Thanks, yeah.

1039
01:13:35.739 --> 01:13:37.741
You said you were
at my high school.


1040
01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:43.546
Graduation?

1041
01:13:43.579 --> 01:13:45.248
Yes, I was.

1042
01:13:45.281 --> 01:13:48.251
Was that just another
one of your lies, or what?


1043
01:13:49.919 --> 01:13:52.088
No, I was there.

1044
01:13:53.623 --> 01:13:55.725
And you were with
your girlfriend.


1045
01:13:55.759 --> 01:13:56.926
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


1046
01:13:58.928 --> 01:14:01.597
And afterwards,

1047
01:14:01.631 --> 01:14:04.734
the two of you went
out and had a pizza.


1048
01:14:04.768 --> 01:14:07.403
You were still wearing
your graduation robes


1049
01:14:07.436 --> 01:14:10.907
and looked absolutely
adorable, if I say so.


1050
01:14:17.113 --> 01:14:19.115
I was sittin' at the
table right next to you.


1051
01:14:22.652 --> 01:14:25.288
Yeah, that was the
last time I saw ya.


1052
01:14:27.456 --> 01:14:28.456
Hmm.

1053
01:14:31.795 --> 01:14:34.798
- Is that-
- Mm-mmm.


1054
01:14:34.831 --> 01:14:35.831
Yeah.

1055
01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:39.936
Yeah.

1056
01:14:39.969 --> 01:14:41.938
I...

1057
01:14:41.971 --> 01:14:45.008
After her burial, I moved
her out, outta there.


1058
01:14:46.475 --> 01:14:47.276
Why?

1059
01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:48.111
I don't know.

1060
01:14:48.144 --> 01:14:49.278
I just...

1061
01:14:49.312 --> 01:14:51.480
I didn't feel right
leavin' her behind,


1062
01:14:53.649 --> 01:14:55.151
and I missed her.

1063
01:14:55.184 --> 01:14:56.184
Yeah.

1064
01:14:57.854 --> 01:15:00.456
She's been there
all these years.


1065
01:15:00.489 --> 01:15:02.358
Excuse me.

1066
01:15:05.995 --> 01:15:09.132
Oh, my god!

1067
01:15:09.165 --> 01:15:11.000
Mina, hi.

1068
01:15:11.034 --> 01:15:12.468
I...

1069
01:15:12.501 --> 01:15:15.138
I really, I meant
to call, I just...


1070
01:15:15.171 --> 01:15:16.339
I was kinda tied up.

1071
01:15:18.507 --> 01:15:19.507
Tony?

1072
01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:21.845
Hola, gringo.

1073
01:15:47.703 --> 01:15:48.838
What?

1074
01:15:48.872 --> 01:15:50.673
Hey!
I'm gonna kill that fucker!


1075
01:15:50.706 --> 01:15:51.841
Tony, Tony!

1076
01:15:51.875 --> 01:15:53.009
Hey!
No!


1077
01:15:53.042 --> 01:15:54.219
Let the cops
take care of this one.


1078
01:15:54.243 --> 01:15:55.354
No, I'm gonna kill that fucker.

1079
01:15:55.378 --> 01:15:56.179
And then what?

1080
01:15:56.212 --> 01:15:57.180
And then Bin Farri!

1081
01:15:57.213 --> 01:15:58.014
Oh, and then what?

1082
01:15:58.047 --> 01:15:59.515
You're a DEA agent.

1083
01:15:59.548 --> 01:16:01.684
All right, fine, fuck it.

1084
01:16:01.717 --> 01:16:03.186
No, no!

1085
01:16:03.219 --> 01:16:04.520
Listen to me.
What?


1086
01:16:04.553 --> 01:16:06.589
You cross that line,
you end up like me.


1087
01:16:09.893 --> 01:16:11.895
I know what I'm talkin' about.

1088
01:16:47.763 --> 01:16:49.465
Put the gun down or I shoot her.

1089
01:16:50.934 --> 01:16:52.735
Put the fucking gun down.

1090
01:16:58.107 --> 01:16:59.107
All right.

1091
01:17:02.778 --> 01:17:04.413
And the other one.

1092
01:17:12.288 --> 01:17:13.256
What now?

1093
01:17:13.289 --> 01:17:14.289
Sit down.

1094
01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:17.960
Call him.

1095
01:17:18.661 --> 01:17:19.929
Your boss?

1096
01:17:19.963 --> 01:17:21.430
The old guy that got you out.

1097
01:17:21.464 --> 01:17:22.464
Why?

1098
01:17:23.967 --> 01:17:27.603
- Call him or she's dead.
- Fuck you!


1099
01:17:27.636 --> 01:17:30.606
You and I both know you're
not gonna shoot her.


1100
01:17:30.639 --> 01:17:32.108
I won't?

1101
01:17:32.141 --> 01:17:32.976
No.

1102
01:17:33.009 --> 01:17:35.144
This neighborhood at this time?

1103
01:17:35.178 --> 01:17:37.446
Cops'll be swarmin'
this place in minutes.


1104
01:17:38.982 --> 01:17:41.450
Okay.

1105
01:17:42.818 --> 01:17:44.820
Call him or I throw her off!

1106
01:17:44.854 --> 01:17:46.322
Fine.

1107
01:17:48.324 --> 01:17:49.324
Now, let her go.

1108
01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.001
Hey, Dad, it's me.

1109
01:18:36.539 --> 01:18:37.539
It's okay.

1110
01:18:38.874 --> 01:18:40.009
Where do I find him?

1111
01:18:40.043 --> 01:18:41.710
Like I'm gonna fuckin' tell you!

1112
01:18:43.212 --> 01:18:44.513
Ow, fuck!

1113
01:18:46.215 --> 01:18:47.683
You could've just
asked me again!


1114
01:18:47.716 --> 01:18:49.685
I'm old and I don't
have that kinda time!


1115
01:18:49.718 --> 01:18:51.220
I don't fucking know!

1116
01:18:51.254 --> 01:18:53.022
All he told me was to get you!

1117
01:18:53.056 --> 01:18:54.566
And how were you
supposed to contact him?


1118
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:56.025
Fucking text!

1119
01:18:56.059 --> 01:18:57.536
And what were you
supposed to say in the text?


1120
01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.727
That I'm on my way.

1121
01:18:58.761 --> 01:19:01.030
- Text him!
- All right, all right!


1122
01:19:07.903 --> 01:19:08.704
Give me the phone.

1123
01:19:08.737 --> 01:19:10.873
Give me the phone!

1124
01:19:10.906 --> 01:19:12.075
Fuck!

1125
01:19:13.576 --> 01:19:17.580
"Kill the agent, make Nick
watch, then bring him here."


1126
01:19:17.613 --> 01:19:19.882
"I'll give you the
million dollars."


1127
01:19:19.915 --> 01:19:21.584
Look, he shared
his location, too.


1128
01:19:23.252 --> 01:19:24.729
- A million dollars?
- A million dollars.


1129
01:19:24.753 --> 01:19:27.556
Bin Farri has a
fucking hard-on for you.


1130
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:28.557
I don't know what you did,

1131
01:19:28.591 --> 01:19:29.892
but he wants you fuckin' dead.

1132
01:19:29.925 --> 01:19:31.894
A million dollars.

1133
01:19:31.927 --> 01:19:33.896
I guess you didn't wanna
share that with anyone,


1134
01:19:33.929 --> 01:19:35.731
so that's why you're here alone?

1135
01:19:35.764 --> 01:19:38.901
That's pretty
industrious of you, Zico.


1136
01:19:38.934 --> 01:19:40.903
Who fucking cares, all right?

1137
01:19:40.936 --> 01:19:42.771
I'm fucked!
Maybe.


1138
01:19:44.607 --> 01:19:45.741
Maybe not.

1139
01:19:45.774 --> 01:19:48.111
Maybe you can help
get Bin Farri to me,


1140
01:19:48.944 --> 01:19:50.946
and you keep the million.

1141
01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:52.448
The fuck I will.

1142
01:19:53.449 --> 01:19:54.950
Yeah fuckin' right.

1143
01:19:54.984 --> 01:19:56.252
And then we just part ways,

1144
01:19:56.285 --> 01:19:57.429
and never see each other again.

1145
01:19:57.453 --> 01:19:58.621
Gentleman's agreement.

1146
01:19:59.455 --> 01:20:00.756
No!

1147
01:20:00.789 --> 01:20:02.291
Fuck that!

1148
01:20:02.325 --> 01:20:05.094
I will kill him before
I let him walk away with


1149
01:20:05.128 --> 01:20:06.595
a million fuckin' dollars!
Tony?


1150
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:07.630
Are you kiddin' me?

1151
01:20:07.663 --> 01:20:09.298
Bin Farri's the target.

1152
01:20:10.466 --> 01:20:12.635
You know you killed
my best friend, right?


1153
01:20:12.668 --> 01:20:14.103
For no fuckin' reason!

1154
01:20:14.137 --> 01:20:15.771
I don't wanna kill nobody, man!

1155
01:20:15.804 --> 01:20:18.274
I just don't wanna
go to El Hongo, man!


1156
01:20:18.307 --> 01:20:20.776
I don't wanna go back there.

1157
01:20:20.809 --> 01:20:22.645
Just fucking kill me now!

1158
01:20:22.678 --> 01:20:24.613
I mean, what the fuck
is wrong with you?!


1159
01:20:24.647 --> 01:20:27.483
Now that kid's gotta grow
up without a fucking dad


1160
01:20:27.516 --> 01:20:29.952
all because of a piece
of shit like you!


1161
01:20:29.985 --> 01:20:30.953
Then fucking kill me!

1162
01:20:30.986 --> 01:20:33.289
- Gladly!
- No, no, no, Tony!


1163
01:20:33.322 --> 01:20:34.790
No, no, no!

1164
01:20:34.823 --> 01:20:35.958
We need him.

1165
01:20:35.991 --> 01:20:36.991
We got a deal.

1166
01:20:41.864 --> 01:20:44.300
Come on, you sorry sack of shit.

1167
01:20:44.333 --> 01:20:46.802
- Fuck that!
- Get up!


1168
01:20:46.835 --> 01:20:48.304
Get on your feet!

1169
01:20:59.014 --> 01:21:02.818
There are 20 patrol
cars outside the building.


1170
01:21:02.851 --> 01:21:04.820
There's a bomb squad.

1171
01:21:04.853 --> 01:21:06.165
They're trying to
dismantle something


1172
01:21:06.189 --> 01:21:07.323
that looks like a bomb.

1173
01:21:07.356 --> 01:21:09.492
It doesn't look like a bomb.

1174
01:21:09.525 --> 01:21:10.326
What is this?

1175
01:21:10.359 --> 01:21:11.694
Why are you involved?

1176
01:21:13.396 --> 01:21:14.997
Why am I involved?

1177
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:18.000
We will go to Dubai
tonight for the time being.


1178
01:21:18.033 --> 01:21:20.002
You will learn more
as I need you to.


1179
01:21:20.035 --> 01:21:22.171
I'm not going anywhere.

1180
01:21:22.205 --> 01:21:23.839
You will go where I tell you.

1181
01:21:23.872 --> 01:21:25.508
No!

1182
01:21:25.541 --> 01:21:26.842
I live here.

1183
01:21:26.875 --> 01:21:28.744
And you haven't
answered my question.


1184
01:21:30.045 --> 01:21:31.680
Did you bring a
bomb to my building?


1185
01:21:31.714 --> 01:21:33.192
- It's not a bomb.
- What is it then?!


1186
01:21:33.216 --> 01:21:34.883
I had a personal project!

1187
01:21:34.917 --> 01:21:37.052
Your personal project
was to build a bomb?


1188
01:21:37.086 --> 01:21:38.887
We're not that family anymore.

1189
01:21:38.921 --> 01:21:41.190
I needed a place to
keep a quantum device.


1190
01:21:41.224 --> 01:21:42.525
It's not a bomb.

1191
01:21:42.558 --> 01:21:45.027
That's why we needed
to upgrade the power.


1192
01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:46.695
You used me?

1193
01:21:46.729 --> 01:21:48.597
You had no problems
taking my money.


1194
01:21:52.735 --> 01:21:53.735
What?

1195
01:21:54.903 --> 01:21:55.738
You know what?

1196
01:21:55.771 --> 01:21:56.872
Fuck this!

1197
01:21:56.905 --> 01:21:58.207
I'm not going anywhere.

1198
01:21:58.241 --> 01:21:59.375
You agreed to do this.

1199
01:21:59.408 --> 01:22:00.209
Not this!

1200
01:22:00.243 --> 01:22:01.410
I'm out!

1201
01:22:01.444 --> 01:22:04.213
The device is being
dismantled as we speak.


1202
01:22:04.247 --> 01:22:05.881
You haven't paid me!

1203
01:22:05.914 --> 01:22:06.715
Manuel is dead.

1204
01:22:06.749 --> 01:22:08.251
It's all over.

1205
01:22:08.284 --> 01:22:10.219
Your people can't keep
a train on tracks.


1206
01:22:10.253 --> 01:22:12.054
Talk about incompetent idiots.

1207
01:22:12.087 --> 01:22:15.057
Fernando, there's no one else.

1208
01:22:15.090 --> 01:22:16.410
You're the only
one who can do it.


1209
01:22:17.426 --> 01:22:19.262
That was enough!

1210
01:22:26.101 --> 01:22:29.572
What?

1211
01:22:49.292 --> 01:22:51.093
Open the door.

1212
01:23:05.808 --> 01:23:07.443
Get him in the back.

1213
01:23:08.811 --> 01:23:09.778
Copy.

1214
01:23:09.812 --> 01:23:10.812
He's here.

1215
01:23:23.492 --> 01:23:24.993
Set him over there.

1216
01:23:28.664 --> 01:23:30.333
What the hell is going on?

1217
01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:38.841
What is this?

1218
01:23:40.175 --> 01:23:41.810
What-

1219
01:23:41.844 --> 01:23:44.480
Fuck!

1220
01:23:44.513 --> 01:23:45.513
Are we good?

1221
01:23:46.515 --> 01:23:47.483
Okay.

1222
01:23:47.516 --> 01:23:48.517
Can we do this now?

1223
01:23:50.185 --> 01:23:51.654
It got a little bit weird.

1224
01:23:51.687 --> 01:23:53.489
- Same account?
- No.


1225
01:23:53.522 --> 01:23:55.324
Use this one.

1226
01:23:55.358 --> 01:23:56.992
Fuck.

1227
01:24:00.863 --> 01:24:02.164
- Okay.
- Yeah?


1228
01:24:02.197 --> 01:24:03.197
Okay.

1229
01:24:06.201 --> 01:24:08.671
Wondering what's next?

1230
01:24:08.704 --> 01:24:09.704
Nah.

1231
01:24:11.039 --> 01:24:13.376
Judgin' by that
character over there,


1232
01:24:13.409 --> 01:24:14.677
I get the idea.

1233
01:24:14.710 --> 01:24:17.546
Looks like you boys
started the party early.


1234
01:24:18.881 --> 01:24:20.516
Let me see him.

1235
01:24:33.896 --> 01:24:34.976
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Ooohh!


1236
01:24:38.901 --> 01:24:39.902
Do something!

1237
01:24:39.935 --> 01:24:42.705
I can't.

1238
01:24:42.738 --> 01:24:44.072
I don't have any bullets.

1239
01:24:44.106 --> 01:24:45.708
Okay, okay, okay!

1240
01:24:47.075 --> 01:24:48.075
No!

1241
01:24:49.412 --> 01:24:50.412
Madam?

1242
01:24:52.415 --> 01:24:53.382
You need to get outta here.

1243
01:24:53.416 --> 01:24:54.383
Go home!

1244
01:24:54.417 --> 01:24:56.218
I live here.

1245
01:24:56.251 --> 01:24:57.420
What?

1246
01:24:57.453 --> 01:24:58.887
Go to the Cultural Center,

1247
01:24:58.921 --> 01:25:00.723
ask for Captain Escalante,

1248
01:25:00.756 --> 01:25:02.958
give him this address,
he'll know what to do.


1249
01:25:03.926 --> 01:25:04.926
Go!

1250
01:25:13.268 --> 01:25:15.237
Okay, okay.

1251
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:17.072
Now you tell me what you want.

1252
01:25:17.105 --> 01:25:18.574
A million dollars?

1253
01:25:18.607 --> 01:25:19.607
No.

1254
01:25:29.284 --> 01:25:31.086
You fucking predator!

1255
01:25:31.119 --> 01:25:32.955
Let's talk about this!

1256
01:25:34.122 --> 01:25:35.924
No.

1257
01:25:43.466 --> 01:25:46.635
Okay, gringo, how
do I get my money?


1258
01:25:48.804 --> 01:25:49.805
Get a job.

1259
01:25:52.307 --> 01:25:53.307
What?

1260
01:26:27.843 --> 01:26:30.012
Zico?

1261
01:27:20.596 --> 01:27:22.030
Whoa, there's a wave comin'!

1262
01:27:22.064 --> 01:27:23.365
And then another wave!

1263
01:27:23.398 --> 01:27:25.367
What are we gonna do, Captain?

1264
01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:26.702
What are we gonna do?

1265
01:27:26.735 --> 01:27:28.537
Oh, my god, look at that fog!

1266
01:27:28.571 --> 01:27:29.538
No, don't cry!

1267
01:27:29.572 --> 01:27:30.706
No, don't.
You want


1268
01:27:30.739 --> 01:27:31.740
everything on it, right?

1269
01:27:31.774 --> 01:27:32.875
Yes, yes.

1270
01:27:32.908 --> 01:27:34.409
Here, I'll take that.

1271
01:27:34.443 --> 01:27:35.578
Oh, my!

1272
01:27:36.411 --> 01:27:38.080
All right, you'll trade off.

1273
01:27:38.113 --> 01:27:39.915
- Whoo!
- Do you have a drink?


1274
01:27:39.948 --> 01:27:41.049
Yeah, I think I do.

1275
01:27:41.083 --> 01:27:42.050
Thank you.

1276
01:27:42.084 --> 01:27:43.552
Mina?

1277
01:27:45.921 --> 01:27:47.389
I gotta tell you,

1278
01:27:47.422 --> 01:27:49.925
this is probably the best
hamburger I've ever had.


1279
01:27:49.958 --> 01:27:51.927
You can't get a decent
hamburger in Mexico.


1280
01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:53.962
You just gotta rely on the taco.

1281
01:27:56.264 --> 01:27:57.232
Thank you.

1282
01:27:57.265 --> 01:27:58.567
I'm better now.
Aww!


1283
01:27:58.601 --> 01:27:59.735
Are you sure?
Yeah.


1284
01:27:59.768 --> 01:28:01.403
I love this junebug.

1285
01:28:01.436 --> 01:28:02.771
Could hold him all day.

1286
01:28:03.972 --> 01:28:05.073
You guys eat first.

1287
01:28:05.107 --> 01:28:06.408
I'm good right now.

1288
01:28:06.441 --> 01:28:08.119
My stomach is still
turning from the boat ride.


1289
01:28:08.143 --> 01:28:10.579
Yeah, it was a little
choppy out there today.


1290
01:28:10.613 --> 01:28:11.446
I'm sorry.

1291
01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:12.748
Ah, it was lovely.

1292
01:28:12.781 --> 01:28:14.917
I'm just not used to it.
Yeah.


1293
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:16.084
Hey!

1294
01:28:16.118 --> 01:28:17.252
I wanted to ask,

1295
01:28:17.285 --> 01:28:19.087
how are you settling
into the new apartment?


1296
01:28:19.121 --> 01:28:19.955
It's good?

1297
01:28:19.988 --> 01:28:21.624
Everything is brand new.

1298
01:28:21.657 --> 01:28:23.258
Hmm.

1299
01:28:23.291 --> 01:28:25.594
We love our
little place, don't we?


1300
01:28:25.628 --> 01:28:27.095
Do you...

1301
01:28:27.129 --> 01:28:28.263
Do you need anything else?

1302
01:28:28.296 --> 01:28:29.264
We're good.

1303
01:28:29.297 --> 01:28:30.432
Thank you.

1304
01:28:30.465 --> 01:28:31.934
You've done enough.

1305
01:28:31.967 --> 01:28:35.270
I still can't get over that
whole life insurance thing.


1306
01:28:35.303 --> 01:28:36.104
Yeah, I know, that was...

1307
01:28:36.138 --> 01:28:38.140
That was pretty odd.

1308
01:28:38.173 --> 01:28:39.107
What happened?

1309
01:28:39.141 --> 01:28:40.609
No.

1310
01:28:40.643 --> 01:28:41.777
My husband never told me

1311
01:28:41.810 --> 01:28:43.646
he had a million
dollar life insurance.


1312
01:28:44.847 --> 01:28:47.449
I thought I'd end up in
the streets with a baby.


1313
01:28:47.482 --> 01:28:49.151
Anthony remembered, thank god!

1314
01:28:50.986 --> 01:28:52.955
And he made them pay.

1315
01:28:52.988 --> 01:28:54.156
Can you imagine?

1316
01:28:55.157 --> 01:28:57.125
Oh, aiy, aiy, aiy, aiy.

1317
01:28:57.159 --> 01:28:58.627
Yeah, yes, da!

1318
01:28:58.661 --> 01:28:59.962
Yessa!
Hey!


1319
01:29:01.196 --> 01:29:01.997
- Right?
- Thanks to his daddy


1320
01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:03.632
and Uncle Tony,

1321
01:29:03.666 --> 01:29:05.810
this big guy's gonna grow up
in such a nice neighborhood


1322
01:29:05.834 --> 01:29:07.636
with lots of other kids.

1323
01:29:07.670 --> 01:29:08.804
Yep.

1324
01:29:08.837 --> 01:29:10.014
And you're gonna
go to college, too.


1325
01:29:10.038 --> 01:29:11.339
Are you?

1326
01:29:11.373 --> 01:29:13.475
Are you gonna go to college?

1327
01:29:13.508 --> 01:29:14.476
You better.

1328
01:29:14.509 --> 01:29:16.178
Maybe he'll go to Berkeley?

1329
01:29:16.211 --> 01:29:17.479
Berkeley?

1330
01:29:17.512 --> 01:29:18.981
Oh, no, no, no,
not Berkeley, no.


1331
01:29:19.014 --> 01:29:21.483
He's going to Notre Dame on
a full football scholarship.


1332
01:29:21.516 --> 01:29:22.651
Mark my words.

1333
01:29:22.685 --> 01:29:23.485
Yeah.

1334
01:29:23.518 --> 01:29:24.820
Vanowen.

1335
01:29:24.853 --> 01:29:26.030
Look out over your starboard bow

1336
01:29:26.054 --> 01:29:27.055
by the breaker wall.

1337
01:29:30.025 --> 01:29:31.994
There you go.

1338
01:29:32.027 --> 01:29:33.495
Hey.

1339
01:29:33.528 --> 01:29:35.698
I see you guys are
having a party without me?


1340
01:29:35.731 --> 01:29:38.000
Well, I'm not upset about that.

1341
01:29:38.033 --> 01:29:39.367
This isn't a social call.

1342
01:29:41.369 --> 01:29:42.838
I figured it wasn't.

1343
01:29:42.871 --> 01:29:44.549
I need a tag-team to
carry out a black warrant


1344
01:29:44.573 --> 01:29:45.908
in San Diego right away.

1345
01:29:47.075 --> 01:29:48.343
All right, cool.

1346
01:29:48.376 --> 01:29:49.520
Tell the old man I'm not upset

1347
01:29:49.544 --> 01:29:51.013
about not bein'
invited to the party.


1348
01:29:51.046 --> 01:29:52.180
Yeah, okay.

1349
01:29:52.214 --> 01:29:53.214
Thanks.

1350
01:30:00.088 --> 01:30:01.023
Fuckin' Frankie!

1351
01:30:01.056 --> 01:30:02.357
He's always wearin' that suit.

1352
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:03.525
What's that all about?

1353
01:30:03.558 --> 01:30:04.359
I don't know,

1354
01:30:04.392 --> 01:30:06.228
but he's got a job in San Diego.

1355
01:30:06.261 --> 01:30:07.529
Do you wanna join?

1356
01:30:07.562 --> 01:30:11.900
Yeah, count me in.

1357
01:30:15.904 --> 01:30:16.905
All right.

1358
01:30:17.906 --> 01:30:21.376
Yeah.

1359
01:30:29.918 --> 01:30:31.053
Oh, lord.
