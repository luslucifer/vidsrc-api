1
00:00:23.297 --> 00:00:26.665
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.


2
00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:30.102
How are you doing?

3
00:00:30.104 --> 00:00:32.938
It's been two weeks
since my last confession.


4
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.209
I've done a lot of bad things
in that time.


5
00:00:37.211 --> 00:00:39.044
Didn't go to church,

6
00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:43.715
I took the Lord's name in vain
quite a few times,


7
00:00:43.717 --> 00:00:45.817
I cursed my mother-in-law,

8
00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:49.521
but it was in Italian,
so she couldn't understand,


9
00:00:49.523 --> 00:00:51.556
so I don't know if that counts.

10
00:00:51.558 --> 00:00:52.691
It counts.

11
00:00:52.693 --> 00:00:54.092
Okay...

12
00:00:54.094 --> 00:00:57.195
And I cheated on my wife.

13
00:00:57.197 --> 00:00:59.865
You committed adultery?

14
00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:00.732
Yes.

15
00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:02.834
How many times?

16
00:01:03.536 --> 00:01:08.006
Five times the last two weeks.

17
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:08.974
Wait...

18
00:01:08.976 --> 00:01:12.878
No, that's wrong.

19
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.383
It was four times this week...

20
00:01:18.385 --> 00:01:20.652
with three women...

21
00:01:20.654 --> 00:01:24.322
and three times last week...

22
00:01:24.324 --> 00:01:26.224
with two other women.

23
00:01:26.226 --> 00:01:26.892
Wow.

24
00:01:26.894 --> 00:01:29.060
Plus, one of the women
from this week


25
00:01:29.062 --> 00:01:30.595
was the same as last week...

26
00:01:30.597 --> 00:01:34.132
or maybe two of the women
was the same,


27
00:01:34.134 --> 00:01:36.268
so I guess that makes...

28
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.969
What? I don't know.
Seven times.


29
00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:41.173
I mean, it was more than
seven times, Father.


30
00:01:41.175 --> 00:01:45.977
It was more like 10 or 12
times, but, you know,
it was like...


31
00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.881
on seven different occasions,
only with five different
women,


32
00:01:49.883 --> 00:01:56.655
but some of the women
more than once...


33
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.558
Some of them quite a few times.

34
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.461
In fact,
it's hard to say, Father.


35
00:02:02.463 --> 00:02:04.029
I didn't exactly keep count,

36
00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:08.066
but let's say a dozen times
in the last two weeks...


37
00:02:08.068 --> 00:02:11.036
give or take a few times.

38
00:02:58.618 --> 00:03:00.652
Rosalie!

39
00:03:16.102 --> 00:03:19.404
Joey, I'm still waiting
for those meatballs, baby.


40
00:03:19.406 --> 00:03:20.305
I'll be right with you.

41
00:03:20.307 --> 00:03:23.141
Hey, thanks for stopping by.

42
00:03:27.613 --> 00:03:30.348
Rosalie,
Wendel wants another beer.


43
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.050
Excuse me.

44
00:03:32.752 --> 00:03:35.754
Benny! What are you doing here?
I thought you was on vacation.


45
00:03:35.756 --> 00:03:36.555
Got back yesterday.

46
00:03:36.557 --> 00:03:38.523
How's Martha?
She's terrific.


47
00:03:38.525 --> 00:03:40.492
You tell her Joey said hello.

48
00:03:40.494 --> 00:03:41.092
I will.

49
00:03:41.094 --> 00:03:43.261
Devo, the meatball,
the meatballs. Come on.


50
00:03:43.263 --> 00:03:47.098
I'll be with you
in one minute, folks.


51
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.893
Donna Joy, you're looking
mighty nice in that mini.


52
00:04:14.895 --> 00:04:16.094
Thanks, Joey.

53
00:04:16.096 --> 00:04:18.997
You're looking
pretty good yourself.


54
00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:22.901
Yeah, you think? Thanks.

55
00:04:24.171 --> 00:04:26.805
Joey's Pizza.

56
00:04:26.807 --> 00:04:28.807
Hey, Ty, how you doing?

57
00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:31.843
How many? How soon?

58
00:04:31.845 --> 00:04:35.313
You want pepperoni,
you got pepperoni.


59
00:04:35.315 --> 00:04:36.548
Devo, take this out.

60
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.148
Rosalie!

61
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.717
Tulsky's coming by
to pick up six pies.


62
00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:41.720
We need more pepperoni.
It's in the back.


63
00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:46.358
Joey's Pizza.

64
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.929
Hey, baby, how you doing?

65
00:04:50.931 --> 00:04:53.465
Oh!

66
00:04:53.467 --> 00:04:54.733
No, no, now's bad.

67
00:04:54.735 --> 00:04:56.368
Now's bad.

68
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.536
Very busy.

69
00:04:58.538 --> 00:05:00.105
How about later on?

70
00:05:00.107 --> 00:05:01.306
Later on. Okay?

71
00:05:01.308 --> 00:05:03.675
I've got to hang up.
My wife's coming.


72
00:05:03.677 --> 00:05:04.643
Okay, bye.

73
00:05:04.645 --> 00:05:07.178
Thanks for calling.

74
00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:11.549
Be quiet, will you?

75
00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:12.283
Shut up!

76
00:05:12.285 --> 00:05:13.985
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Mom.


77
00:05:13.987 --> 00:05:15.186
Dominic.

78
00:05:15.188 --> 00:05:17.989
Devo.

79
00:05:17.991 --> 00:05:21.926
"Mr. Crystal,
let it shine.


80
00:05:23.195 --> 00:05:25.363
Spikes just like
a porcupine."


81
00:05:25.365 --> 00:05:26.765
Hello, you two.

82
00:05:26.767 --> 00:05:27.298
Hi!

83
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.800
This is hot. I'll be
with you in a minute.


84
00:05:28.802 --> 00:05:29.768
I'm going to drop this off.

85
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.405
Okay.
I'm going to go see Dad.


86
00:05:33.407 --> 00:05:34.673
Hi, Daddy.

87
00:05:34.675 --> 00:05:36.274
Who said that?

88
00:05:36.276 --> 00:05:39.110
What? What?

89
00:05:40.446 --> 00:05:43.014
Let me see your picture, Dom.

90
00:05:43.016 --> 00:05:45.850
Oh, that's really good.
What is it?


91
00:05:45.852 --> 00:05:47.118
What does it look like?

92
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.054
It looks like a pizza pie?

93
00:05:49.056 --> 00:05:50.989
Mom, it's a flower.

94
00:05:50.991 --> 00:05:53.058
Oh, I'm sorry.

95
00:05:55.194 --> 00:05:56.961
What do you think?

96
00:05:56.963 --> 00:05:58.997
Michelangelo.

97
00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:01.700
Look at that.

98
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:34.165
Oh, the defenders of justice.
Hello.


99
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.672
Uh-oh. Cheese it, the cops!

100
00:06:41.707 --> 00:06:42.707
Here you go, Larry. All set.

101
00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:45.110
Sausage and 'rooms,
heavy on the 'rooms.


102
00:06:45.112 --> 00:06:47.312
Thank you, Joey.

103
00:06:47.314 --> 00:06:49.314
Carlos, what's the matter?

104
00:06:49.316 --> 00:06:49.914
Nothing.

105
00:06:49.916 --> 00:06:51.850
Hey, kids, how's it going?

106
00:06:51.852 --> 00:06:52.751
Okay.

107
00:06:52.753 --> 00:06:54.886
Larry, Larry, Larry.

108
00:06:54.888 --> 00:06:56.421
Look what Dominic did today.

109
00:06:56.423 --> 00:06:57.622
You ever see anything
so beautiful?


110
00:06:57.624 --> 00:07:02.227
Dominic, that's lovely.
What is that, a flower?


111
00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:03.995
No, it's a pizza.

112
00:07:03.997 --> 00:07:05.797
It's pepperoni, I bet.

113
00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:09.200
Yeah, it could be.
I'm not sure. Yeah.


114
00:07:09.202 --> 00:07:11.136
I love pepperoni.

115
00:07:11.138 --> 00:07:12.003
Next time.

116
00:07:12.005 --> 00:07:13.037
You always say next time.

117
00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:13.972
I heard you caught that guy

118
00:07:13.974 --> 00:07:16.941
who was robbing
all them 7-Elevens.


119
00:07:16.943 --> 00:07:18.443
You caught that guy?

120
00:07:18.445 --> 00:07:19.043
Right.

121
00:07:19.045 --> 00:07:20.812
Picked him up last night.

122
00:07:20.814 --> 00:07:21.446
Thank God!

123
00:07:21.448 --> 00:07:22.747
You're doing a great job.

124
00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:24.082
You hear that?

125
00:07:24.084 --> 00:07:27.051
That's how come, in America,
we live safe,
have a good life,


126
00:07:27.053 --> 00:07:29.254
because we've got cops like
Larry Schooner and
Carlos Wiley


127
00:07:29.256 --> 00:07:32.123
who make sure everybody
does what he's supposed to do.


128
00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:34.392
You work hard, pay taxes,
obey the law,


129
00:07:34.394 --> 00:07:37.362
you can have anything you want.

130
00:07:37.364 --> 00:07:38.296
I want my kids to understand

131
00:07:38.298 --> 00:07:41.332
what a great country
we've got here.


132
00:07:41.334 --> 00:07:44.869
I think they understand.

133
00:08:03.088 --> 00:08:04.989
Hey, Rosalie,
keep your eye on the shop.


134
00:08:04.991 --> 00:08:07.625
I've got to look
at Lacey Flynn's plumbing.


135
00:08:07.627 --> 00:08:10.061
Okay, sweetie.

136
00:08:10.063 --> 00:08:11.095
Her plumbing?

137
00:08:11.097 --> 00:08:12.063
Devo, when you're done there,

138
00:08:12.065 --> 00:08:13.865
I want you to go around back

139
00:08:13.867 --> 00:08:15.767
and clean out the garbage cans.

140
00:08:15.769 --> 00:08:19.270
They're full of maggots.

141
00:08:19.672 --> 00:08:23.508
Maggots. That's perfect.
I love that man.


142
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.876
Don't worry.
I'll do it with you.


143
00:08:24.878 --> 00:08:28.580
No, please, that's my job,
taking care of maggots.


144
00:08:29.415 --> 00:08:32.650
How you doing?

145
00:08:33.986 --> 00:08:36.187
How you doing?

146
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.000
This is the third time this week

147
00:08:49.002 --> 00:08:51.102
he's gone up there
to visit Lacey's pipes.


148
00:08:51.104 --> 00:08:53.371
Come on, he owns the building.

149
00:08:53.373 --> 00:08:54.672
He has to take care of it.

150
00:08:54.674 --> 00:08:56.474
See the way she looks at him?

151
00:08:56.476 --> 00:08:57.709
That's not his fault.

152
00:08:57.711 --> 00:09:00.211
Besides, she's lonely.
I feel sorry for her.


153
00:09:00.213 --> 00:09:01.579
Don't feel sorry for her.

154
00:09:01.581 --> 00:09:03.548
It's too convenient for Joey.

155
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.050
Hey, you shouldn't
talk like that.


156
00:09:06.052 --> 00:09:07.185
It's not right.

157
00:09:07.187 --> 00:09:08.253
Joey's my husband.

158
00:09:08.255 --> 00:09:10.688
I don't want
to see you get hurt.


159
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.326
I can take care of myself.
Don't worry about me.


160
00:09:22.502 --> 00:09:24.435
Who is it?

161
00:09:24.437 --> 00:09:26.905
It's the pizza man.

162
00:09:26.907 --> 00:09:28.506
Hello, pizza man.

163
00:09:28.508 --> 00:09:29.073
Hello.

164
00:09:29.075 --> 00:09:30.341
I'm here to check your pipes.

165
00:09:30.343 --> 00:09:33.211
I'm so glad because water's
squirting everywhere.


166
00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:37.849
Think she's pretty?

167
00:09:38.717 --> 00:09:40.952
Yeah, I guess so.

168
00:09:44.023 --> 00:09:45.023
I've got eyes, you know?

169
00:09:45.025 --> 00:09:46.991
I can see a lot of girls
are crazy for Joey,


170
00:09:46.993 --> 00:09:48.927
and he has an eye
for the ladies too.


171
00:09:48.929 --> 00:09:51.296
That's okay. He's Italian.
He's allowed to look.


172
00:09:51.298 --> 00:09:54.799
In reality as we know it,
some men do more than look.


173
00:09:54.801 --> 00:09:59.570
You don't trust anyone, Devo.
That's your whole trouble.


174
00:09:59.572 --> 00:10:00.238
I trust you.

175
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.275
Joey would never
run around on me.


176
00:10:04.277 --> 00:10:05.277
Rosalie...

177
00:10:05.278 --> 00:10:06.010
He never would.

178
00:10:06.012 --> 00:10:07.211
Let me put it this way.

179
00:10:07.213 --> 00:10:09.580
Let's say you had a dream
that he did,


180
00:10:09.582 --> 00:10:12.250
and the dream
turned out to be true.


181
00:10:12.252 --> 00:10:14.519
What would you do?

182
00:10:14.521 --> 00:10:15.620
I'd kill myself,

183
00:10:15.622 --> 00:10:18.389
and if I didn't feel any
better, I'd kill him.


184
00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:20.124
Yeah.

185
00:10:28.567 --> 00:10:29.867
Joey, stay a little longer.

186
00:10:29.869 --> 00:10:31.903
Oh, I can't.
I've got a lot of work.


187
00:10:31.905 --> 00:10:33.671
Maybe you'll come back later?

188
00:10:33.673 --> 00:10:34.339
Maybe later.

189
00:10:34.341 --> 00:10:36.641
Maybe even spend the night?

190
00:10:36.842 --> 00:10:37.942
What are you, crazy?

191
00:10:37.944 --> 00:10:40.078
I can't spend the night.

192
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.213
I've got a wife and family.

193
00:10:42.215 --> 00:10:45.016
Joey, you don't love your wife.

194
00:10:45.018 --> 00:10:46.417
Who says so?

195
00:10:46.419 --> 00:10:47.518
Of course I love her.

196
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.020
Just because I make love to you

197
00:10:49.022 --> 00:10:50.855
doesn't mean I don't love her.

198
00:10:50.857 --> 00:10:52.991
What kind of marriage is that?

199
00:10:52.993 --> 00:10:54.492
It's a good marriage.

200
00:10:54.494 --> 00:10:56.561
I buy the food, she cooks it.

201
00:10:56.563 --> 00:10:57.495
I can cook for you.

202
00:10:57.497 --> 00:11:00.665
You can't cook for me.
You're not my wife.


203
00:11:00.667 --> 00:11:02.200
You're not even Italian.

204
00:11:02.202 --> 00:11:03.202
Neither is your wife.

205
00:11:03.203 --> 00:11:06.371
She's some kind of
Eurasian or something.


206
00:11:06.373 --> 00:11:08.673
No, she's not from there.

207
00:11:08.675 --> 00:11:11.042
She's...
Her mother's from Yugoslavia.


208
00:11:11.044 --> 00:11:13.244
It's a good Catholic country.
Right next to Italy.


209
00:11:13.246 --> 00:11:15.847
In fact,
it used to be part of Italy.


210
00:11:15.849 --> 00:11:16.447
I think.

211
00:11:16.449 --> 00:11:20.852
Joey, this isn't Italy.
This is America.


212
00:11:23.322 --> 00:11:26.124
Hey, America was discovered
by one Italian,


213
00:11:26.126 --> 00:11:27.658
and it's named after another.

214
00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.128
So what?
What does that prove?


215
00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.597
It proves that America
is an Italian country.


216
00:11:32.599 --> 00:11:33.331
I've got to go.

217
00:11:33.333 --> 00:11:35.366
Joey, if you're
such a good Catholic,


218
00:11:35.368 --> 00:11:37.435
why do you commit adultery?

219
00:11:37.437 --> 00:11:38.202
I'm a man.

220
00:11:38.204 --> 00:11:40.338

Oh, no. Go ahead.
Throw it out.

What are they, runes?

286
00:14:38.384 --> 00:14:41.419
They're stones.
They're very spiritual.


287
00:14:41.421 --> 00:14:43.020
They have metaphysical powers.

00:14:44.224 --> 00:14:45.189
It wouldn't say...

290
00:14:45.191 --> 00:14:47.959
Well, they tell you
where you're at.

No, spiritually.

I don't know

I mean, I'm a Catholic.

00:16:06.306 --> 00:16:07.571
You know why?
Because he refused


327
00:16:07.573 --> 00:16:10.207
to put the top back
on the mustard jar.


328
00:16:10.209 --> 00:16:12.543
Yeah, 27 times.

329
00:16:12.545 --> 00:16:14.245
Can you imagine?

330
00:16:14.247 --> 00:16:16.647
We got any peanuts or pretzels,

331
00:16:16.649 --> 00:16:17.815
something to munch on?

332
00:16:17.817 --> 00:16:19.817
No, I think we're out.

333
00:16:19.819 --> 00:16:21.519
We're always out.

334
00:16:21.521 --> 00:16:22.453
My mama's house,

335
00:16:22.455 --> 00:16:23.354
there's always
plenty food to eat.


336
00:16:23.356 --> 00:16:25.456
Maybe you should
live with your mama.


337
00:16:25.458 --> 00:16:26.324
Don't be sarcastic.

338
00:16:26.326 --> 00:16:27.091
Don't be a nudge.

339
00:16:27.093 --> 00:16:28.225
Don't call me that nudge thing.

340
00:16:28.227 --> 00:16:31.395
Come on. I'm Italian.
I like to eat.


341
00:16:31.397 --> 00:16:32.129
I'm Yugoslavian.

342
00:16:32.131 --> 00:16:34.398
I don't like to cook,
especially for nudges.


343
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.334
Yeah, don't call me a nudge.

344
00:16:36.336 --> 00:16:38.803
Nudge, nudge, nudge.

345
00:16:38.805 --> 00:16:40.304
Give me those shoes.

346
00:16:40.306 --> 00:16:42.540
You going out again tonight?

347
00:16:42.542 --> 00:16:43.240
Hey, Rosalie, come on.

348
00:16:43.242 --> 00:16:44.942
What? I haven't
said anything.


349
00:16:44.944 --> 00:16:47.111
I work every day. All day.
Okay? Every day.


350
00:16:47.113 --> 00:16:51.816
At night, I like to relax,
go out, have fun, you know.


351
00:16:51.818 --> 00:16:53.651
I thought you were staying home.

352
00:16:53.653 --> 00:16:56.287
What for?

353
00:16:56.289 --> 00:16:58.422
What for?

354
00:16:58.424 --> 00:17:00.391
I don't know.

355
00:17:00.393 --> 00:17:04.128
Who knows?

356
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:05.996
Well, like what?

357
00:17:05.998 --> 00:17:10.368
Well, for one thing,
we've got paperwork.


358
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:11.936
Paperwork?

359
00:17:11.938 --> 00:17:15.906
The monthly bills,
the insurance, the mortgage,


360
00:17:15.908 --> 00:17:16.874
the phone bill.

361
00:17:16.876 --> 00:17:18.275
I'm going out.

362
00:17:18.277 --> 00:17:20.511
♪ Miss Mary Mac, Mac, Mac ♪

363
00:17:20.513 --> 00:17:23.114
♪ At the discotheque
Theque, theque ♪


364
00:17:23.116 --> 00:17:24.882

365

Her back, back, back... ♪


366
00:17:48.006 --> 00:17:49.673
Vodka, please.

367
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:02.753
Mickey, that's on me.

368
00:18:02.755 --> 00:18:04.488
You got it, Joey.

369
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.558
Joey Boca's my name.

370
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.526
And you know what?

371
00:18:08.528 --> 00:18:10.094
I know something about you.

372
00:18:10.096 --> 00:18:11.929
Yeah? What do you know
about me?


373
00:18:11.931 --> 00:18:14.698
I know you never been
in here before in your life.


374
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.034
Really? How do you know?
Maybe I have.


375
00:18:17.036 --> 00:18:19.737
If you had, I would
have known about it.


376
00:18:19.739 --> 00:18:21.405
People would have
talked about it.


377
00:18:21.407 --> 00:18:23.574
Like, "Joey, you see

378
00:18:23.576 --> 00:18:26.010
"what was in here
the other night?


379
00:18:26.012 --> 00:18:27.111
My God, what a beauty."

380
00:18:27.113 --> 00:18:28.979
It's true.

381
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:30.381
No, someone like you

382
00:18:30.383 --> 00:18:31.782
doesn't come around that often.

383
00:18:31.784 --> 00:18:33.217
It's like a national holiday.

384
00:18:33.219 --> 00:18:34.285
Know what I mean?

385
00:18:34.287 --> 00:18:37.054
You don't forget it.

386
00:18:41.993 --> 00:18:45.062
Listen, I appreciate the drink,

387
00:18:45.064 --> 00:18:46.997
but I'm with someone.

388
00:18:46.999 --> 00:18:47.598
Someone very lucky.

389
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.067
I wish I could be that lucky.

390
00:18:50.069 --> 00:18:52.570
I look at you
and I say to myself,


391
00:18:52.572 --> 00:18:54.104
"My God, the man
who gets to walk


392
00:18:54.106 --> 00:18:57.475
"with this woman must feel
like a king on earth."


393
00:18:57.477 --> 00:19:01.278
Here's to you.

394
00:19:07.786 --> 00:19:10.688
I guess I'd better get back.

395
00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:11.989
Show me your boyfriend.

396
00:19:11.991 --> 00:19:14.124
I want to see him
with my own eyes,


397
00:19:14.126 --> 00:19:17.127
so I can spend
the rest of my life


398
00:19:17.129 --> 00:19:20.064
wishing I was him.

399
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.468
He's sitting in the corner.

400
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:26.103
Over there.

401
00:19:29.674 --> 00:19:32.576
Not the one in the yellow shirt?

402
00:19:32.578 --> 00:19:34.044
Yeah, that's him.

403
00:19:34.046 --> 00:19:36.080
No.

404
00:19:36.082 --> 00:19:37.047
Yeah.

405
00:19:37.049 --> 00:19:37.815
No.

406
00:19:37.817 --> 00:19:40.084
Yeah, that's him.

407
00:19:40.086 --> 00:19:40.618
Why?

408
00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:46.023
You expect me to believe
that a beauty like you,


409
00:19:46.025 --> 00:19:48.893
a woman any man
would die to be with,


410
00:19:48.895 --> 00:19:52.897
is throwing herself away
on someone like that?


411
00:19:52.899 --> 00:19:55.533
You could have anyone. Anyone.

412
00:19:55.535 --> 00:19:58.369
Why would you take him?

413
00:19:58.371 --> 00:20:00.204
He's not my boyfriend
or anything.


414
00:20:00.206 --> 00:20:02.973
I just came here with him.

415
00:20:02.975 --> 00:20:06.343
I'm not in love with him
or anything.


416
00:20:06.345 --> 00:20:13.450
Of course not.
How could you be?


417
00:21:23.255 --> 00:21:26.490
Is he going to watch or what?

418
00:21:26.492 --> 00:21:27.358
Does it bother you?

419
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.693
Well, I'm Italian, you know.

420
00:21:29.695 --> 00:21:31.829
I can't make love to a woman

421
00:21:31.831 --> 00:21:33.731
with a German shepherd
in the room.


422
00:21:33.733 --> 00:21:35.566
It's awkward for him.

423
00:21:35.568 --> 00:21:37.901
You can't?

424
00:21:48.413 --> 00:21:49.647
Excuse me.

425
00:21:49.649 --> 00:21:51.181
Here you go.

426
00:21:51.183 --> 00:21:53.917
Attaboy.

427
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.856
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, Heinz.</i>

428
00:22:03.662 --> 00:22:04.662
I can't figure it out.

429
00:22:04.664 --> 00:22:06.263
A young, good-looking
guy like you,


430
00:22:06.265 --> 00:22:10.000
how come you're always
hanging out with Rosalie?


431
00:22:10.002 --> 00:22:12.169
I enjoy her company.

432
00:22:12.171 --> 00:22:14.271
You're not moving in on my wife?

433
00:22:14.273 --> 00:22:18.876
No, of course not.
What are you, kidding?


434
00:22:18.878 --> 00:22:20.110
That's ludicrous.

435
00:22:20.112 --> 00:22:22.212
You're being ridiculous.

436
00:22:22.214 --> 00:22:23.614
What's ridiculous?

437
00:22:23.616 --> 00:22:25.115
There's nobody like Rosalie.

438
00:22:25.117 --> 00:22:26.183
Right.

439
00:22:26.185 --> 00:22:27.151
She's the best.

440
00:22:27.153 --> 00:22:27.751
Exactly.

441
00:22:27.753 --> 00:22:29.186
I can't believe
you're saying that.


442
00:22:29.188 --> 00:22:32.056
Why not? She's my wife.

443
00:22:32.058 --> 00:22:35.259
Yeah, I know.
I look at other women.


444
00:22:35.261 --> 00:22:38.529
Okay. So what?
That's only natural.


445
00:22:38.531 --> 00:22:39.830
I'm a human man.

446
00:22:39.832 --> 00:22:41.331
It don't hurt Rosalie.

447
00:22:41.333 --> 00:22:42.900
How can you say that?

448
00:22:42.902 --> 00:22:45.602
Even if she knows,
she don't care.


449
00:22:45.604 --> 00:22:47.004
That's how she is.

450
00:22:47.006 --> 00:22:47.604
Oh yeah?

451
00:22:47.606 --> 00:22:50.274
Well, that's pure projection.

452
00:22:50.276 --> 00:22:51.375
Pure what?

453
00:22:51.377 --> 00:22:52.142
Projection.

454
00:22:52.144 --> 00:22:55.612
It's projection,
what you want to think.


455
00:22:55.614 --> 00:22:56.614
What I want to think?

456
00:22:56.615 --> 00:22:58.315
Yeah, it makes you feel good

457
00:22:58.317 --> 00:23:01.485
to think that she's happy.

458
00:23:01.487 --> 00:23:03.053
Yeah!

459
00:23:03.055 --> 00:23:06.390
As long as she's happy,
I'm happy.


460
00:23:06.392 --> 00:23:09.493
I'm glad we understand
each other.


461
00:23:09.495 --> 00:23:12.229
Well, me too.

462
00:23:12.231 --> 00:23:15.799
I hear Spino took off
to Bellingham?


463
00:23:15.801 --> 00:23:17.534
Yeah.

464
00:23:17.536 --> 00:23:18.635
Yeah?

465
00:23:18.637 --> 00:23:19.303
Got to go, man.

466
00:23:19.305 --> 00:23:21.672
Okay, take it easy, Billy.

467
00:23:27.612 --> 00:23:30.047
How do you know
these weird people?


468
00:23:30.049 --> 00:23:33.684
That guy was in prison
with my brother.


469
00:23:33.686 --> 00:23:35.586
My first boyfriend had a Harley.

470
00:23:35.588 --> 00:23:38.288
Rocco Jacobs.

471
00:23:39.557 --> 00:23:43.660
What a piece of work he was.

472
00:23:43.662 --> 00:23:45.162
We used to go fast.

473
00:23:45.164 --> 00:23:46.864
Maybe I should get a bike.

474
00:23:46.866 --> 00:23:52.770
Sure. Why not?
Drives the girls crazy.


475
00:23:52.772 --> 00:23:54.404
I was wild back then.

476
00:23:54.406 --> 00:23:57.374
So what happened to Rocco?

477
00:23:57.376 --> 00:23:58.175
Joey Boca happened.

478
00:23:58.177 --> 00:24:00.177
He said, "Hey, I'm Joey.
You want to go out?


479
00:24:00.179 --> 00:24:03.447
What are you doing
with that jerk?"


480
00:24:04.816 --> 00:24:08.485
As soon as I saw Joey,
I knew he was the one.


481
00:24:08.487 --> 00:24:09.720
So fast?

482
00:24:09.722 --> 00:24:10.821
Sure, fast.

483
00:24:10.823 --> 00:24:12.189
I do what I feel.

484
00:24:12.191 --> 00:24:14.057
Then you must have felt
suicidal.


485
00:24:14.059 --> 00:24:17.561
Shut up.

486
00:24:17.563 --> 00:24:21.265
Some day, you're going to find
a wonderful woman,


487
00:24:21.267 --> 00:24:23.500
and you'll drive her crazy
with this big motorcycle.


488
00:24:23.502 --> 00:24:25.936
I found myself
a wonderful woman,


489
00:24:25.938 --> 00:24:26.904
but she's married.

490
00:24:26.906 --> 00:24:30.407
Devo, you're good for my ego.

491
00:24:30.409 --> 00:24:32.643
You've got to meet somebody
your own age.


492
00:24:32.645 --> 00:24:33.310
Why?

493
00:24:33.312 --> 00:24:35.946
Your heart doesn't know
how old you are.


494
00:24:35.948 --> 00:24:37.447
Hi. Is Joey around?

495
00:24:37.449 --> 00:24:38.782
No, he's not.

496
00:24:38.784 --> 00:24:41.285
I'm his wife.
Can I help you?


497
00:24:41.287 --> 00:24:44.321
Oh...

498
00:24:44.323 --> 00:24:45.656
I met him at a bowling alley,

499
00:24:45.658 --> 00:24:48.592
and he told me he had
some apartments to rent.


500
00:24:48.594 --> 00:24:49.726
He's up there right now.

501
00:24:49.728 --> 00:24:51.428
Fixing the pipes.

502
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.263
This is my friend, Devo.

503
00:24:53.265 --> 00:24:55.065
What is your name?

504
00:24:55.067 --> 00:24:56.533
Bridget.

505
00:24:56.535 --> 00:24:57.367
Bridget.

506
00:24:57.369 --> 00:24:58.635
Bridget, meet Devo.

507
00:24:58.637 --> 00:24:59.837
Hi.

508
00:24:59.839 --> 00:25:00.771
Hello.

509
00:25:00.773 --> 00:25:05.609
Come on. I'll take you up.

510
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.882
I think it's time I was
moving out of my house.


511
00:25:11.884 --> 00:25:14.685
I was about your age
when I moved out.


512
00:25:14.687 --> 00:25:15.919
I got married to Joey.

513
00:25:15.921 --> 00:25:17.521
Now my mother lives with us.

514
00:25:17.523 --> 00:25:18.856
That must be fun.

515
00:25:18.858 --> 00:25:19.990
It's okay.

516
00:25:19.992 --> 00:25:20.791
Oh, here's Joey now.

517
00:25:20.793 --> 00:25:25.462
Bridget, how you doing?
What are you doing here?


518
00:25:25.464 --> 00:25:29.466
She wants to look at
one of the apartments, baby.


519
00:25:29.468 --> 00:25:30.033
Today?

520
00:25:30.035 --> 00:25:30.968
Do you have any vacancies?

521
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:34.238
We might have one
coming up next month.


522
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.074
Might as well take a look
while she's here.


523
00:25:37.076 --> 00:25:39.610
Yeah, yeah.

524
00:25:39.612 --> 00:25:40.612
No.

525
00:25:40.613 --> 00:25:41.778
No, it's...

526
00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.380
It's not a good time.

527
00:25:43.382 --> 00:25:45.382
Maybe tomorrow.
How's that?


528
00:25:45.384 --> 00:25:46.917
Sure. Tomorrow.

529
00:25:46.919 --> 00:25:49.286
Well, it was nice to meet you,
Mrs. Boca.


530
00:25:49.288 --> 00:25:51.154
Rosalie.

531
00:25:51.156 --> 00:25:52.489
Rosalie.

532
00:25:52.491 --> 00:25:53.323
Bye.

533
00:25:53.325 --> 00:25:54.591
Bye-bye, now.

534
00:25:54.593 --> 00:25:56.593
Bye-bye.

535
00:25:56.661 --> 00:25:57.694
She came all this way.

536
00:25:57.696 --> 00:25:58.996
You couldn't show her today?

537
00:25:58.998 --> 00:26:02.199
No, no. I've got a lot to do.
I'm not Superman.


538
00:26:02.201 --> 00:26:06.136
Hey, Joey!

539
00:26:06.138 --> 00:26:07.905
You forgot this.

540
00:26:08.072 --> 00:26:11.341
Thanks.

541
00:26:12.243 --> 00:26:14.544
I don't like that Dewey Brown.

542
00:26:14.546 --> 00:26:17.047
Why not?
She's a nice girl.


543
00:26:17.049 --> 00:26:18.749
She's got eyes for you, Joey.

544
00:26:18.751 --> 00:26:19.850
What?

545
00:26:19.852 --> 00:26:20.384
I can see that.

546
00:26:20.386 --> 00:26:22.152
Come on.
She's only a kid.


547
00:26:22.154 --> 00:26:25.923
She's very pretty.
You think she's pretty?


548
00:26:25.925 --> 00:26:26.623
She's pretty.

549
00:26:26.625 --> 00:26:28.191
She's got a beautiful body too.

550
00:26:28.193 --> 00:26:29.326
So what?
What do I care?


551
00:26:29.328 --> 00:26:31.762
You're the best wife
in the world.


552
00:26:31.764 --> 00:26:34.364
What more could I want?

553
00:26:37.268 --> 00:26:38.635
You work too hard.

554
00:26:38.637 --> 00:26:40.003
You should get a plumber.

555
00:26:40.005 --> 00:26:42.739
I can't afford that,
and you know it.


556
00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:45.709
I can never get you
to fix anything at home.


557
00:26:45.711 --> 00:26:46.910
Your mother fixes everything.

558
00:26:46.912 --> 00:26:50.580
Grandma Mechanic:
half-woman, half-wrench.


559
00:26:50.582 --> 00:26:54.051
So this goes right here. See?

560
00:26:54.053 --> 00:26:56.019
Holds it together.

561
00:26:56.021 --> 00:26:58.922
This is a restaurant,
not a garage.


562
00:26:58.924 --> 00:27:00.757
Grandma Nadja can fix anything.

563
00:27:00.759 --> 00:27:03.527
She fixed Mommy's car yesterday.

564
00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:04.361
Alternator was shot.

565
00:27:04.363 --> 00:27:08.832
It's not natural, a woman
doing this kind of work.


566
00:27:08.834 --> 00:27:11.768
You know, people get paid
$20, $30 an hour


567
00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:12.602
for this kind of work.

568
00:27:12.604 --> 00:27:15.539
You get free room and board.
What more do you want?


569
00:27:15.541 --> 00:27:17.507
Don't talk to Mama that way!

570
00:27:17.509 --> 00:27:19.843
She belongs in an
old-age home.


571
00:27:23.415 --> 00:27:24.848
What did she say?

572
00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:26.616
Don't listen to him, okay?

573
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.875
I'll come back later.

574
00:27:56.981 --> 00:27:58.515
What's the matter, Dom?

575
00:27:58.517 --> 00:27:59.416
What happened?

576
00:27:59.418 --> 00:28:00.684
I hurt my finger.

577
00:28:00.686 --> 00:28:01.785
Let me see.

578
00:28:01.787 --> 00:28:03.153
We can fix that.

579
00:28:03.155 --> 00:28:05.188
Here. No problem.

580
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:06.023
We'll fix it right up.

581
00:28:06.025 --> 00:28:07.758
Now put that in your mouth.

582
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.725
How's that?

583
00:28:08.727 --> 00:28:10.627
Better? Yeah?

584
00:28:10.629 --> 00:28:13.296
Good. That's my boy.

585
00:28:16.769 --> 00:28:19.770
Can we eat?

586
00:28:31.883 --> 00:28:33.150
I'm returning these.

587
00:28:33.152 --> 00:28:35.919
Okay. Thanks.

588
00:28:50.868 --> 00:28:54.771
What am I doing
in a library?


589
00:28:55.339 --> 00:28:58.842
What's that perfume?
You smell so good.


590
00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:00.310
Joey.

591
00:29:00.312 --> 00:29:00.877
What?

592
00:29:00.879 --> 00:29:03.580
Not here. They're
going to throw us out.


593
00:29:03.582 --> 00:29:05.282
Good.

594
00:29:05.284 --> 00:29:07.417
Get your book,
and let's get out of here.


595
00:29:07.419 --> 00:29:10.053
Where are we going to go?

596
00:29:10.055 --> 00:29:12.823
I say we go to your place,

597
00:29:12.825 --> 00:29:13.890
have a good time.

598
00:29:13.892 --> 00:29:15.992
What about your wife?

599
00:29:15.994 --> 00:29:19.863
No, she can't come.

600
00:29:21.265 --> 00:29:22.265
All set? Come on.

601
00:29:22.267 --> 00:29:25.869
I've got to
get back to work soon.


602
00:29:50.862 --> 00:29:52.229
Mrs. Boca?

603
00:29:52.231 --> 00:29:54.931
Hi, Millie. Hi.

604
00:29:54.933 --> 00:29:56.066
You okay?

605
00:29:56.068 --> 00:29:57.134
Did somebody mug you?

606
00:29:57.136 --> 00:30:01.371
I'm fine, sweetie.

607
00:30:01.373 --> 00:30:03.540
I...

608
00:30:03.542 --> 00:30:06.776
I lost something, but it's okay.

609
00:30:06.778 --> 00:30:09.379
You go ahead, guys.
I'll be all right.


610
00:30:09.381 --> 00:30:12.048
Could we help you look for it?

611
00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:16.920
I'll find it.

612
00:30:16.922 --> 00:30:17.787
Okay.

613
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:19.923
Come on.

614
00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:50.120
Fool. Stupid fool!

615
00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.054
Divorce him? No, never.
Why should I?


616
00:31:58.056 --> 00:32:00.624
So he can move in
with some other woman?


617
00:32:00.626 --> 00:32:01.658
I'd rather see him dead first.

618
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.461
Good. He deserves to die.

619
00:32:04.463 --> 00:32:08.999
Leaves dirty towels
everywhere. He's a mess.


620
00:32:09.001 --> 00:32:12.135
I hate him, Mama.

621
00:32:12.137 --> 00:32:14.738
All these years,
what a fool I am.


622
00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.940
Devo tried to warn me too.

623
00:32:16.942 --> 00:32:23.280
The sooner he's dead,
the sooner you begin to live.


624
00:32:23.282 --> 00:32:26.883
I know someone who needs money.

625
00:32:26.885 --> 00:32:27.984
He'd do it.

626
00:32:27.986 --> 00:32:30.687
He's a good boy, very nice.

627
00:32:30.689 --> 00:32:32.989
How do you know
these sort of people?


628
00:32:32.991 --> 00:32:34.958
I've got a lot of friends.

629
00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.526
You know that.

630
00:32:36.528 --> 00:32:38.061
Killers?

631
00:32:38.063 --> 00:32:39.896
Not real killers, no.

632
00:32:39.898 --> 00:32:42.899
They only do it for money.

633
00:32:45.703 --> 00:32:47.304
What if we get caught?

634
00:32:47.306 --> 00:32:48.605
Oh, Rosalie, please.

635
00:32:48.607 --> 00:32:51.941
In America, people kill
each other left and right.


636
00:32:51.943 --> 00:32:53.877
It's like national pastime.

637
00:32:53.879 --> 00:32:56.479
Nobody gets caught.

638
00:32:57.415 --> 00:32:58.415
I don't know.

639
00:32:58.417 --> 00:33:01.217
I just haven't done
this kind of thing


640
00:33:01.219 --> 00:33:02.485
in a long time.

641
00:33:02.487 --> 00:33:04.921
Well, it comes back easy.

642
00:33:04.923 --> 00:33:05.722
When was last time?

643
00:33:05.724 --> 00:33:08.925
It was a long time ago.
I don't remember exactly.


644
00:33:08.927 --> 00:33:11.861
Well, you'll do it for me.

645
00:33:11.863 --> 00:33:12.796
Okay.

646
00:33:12.798 --> 00:33:14.597
In honor of your friendship
with my grandmother,


647
00:33:14.599 --> 00:33:18.134
I guarantee I'll take
this guy out.


648
00:33:18.136 --> 00:33:19.803
Okay. You're very good boy.

649
00:33:19.805 --> 00:33:22.806
So many young people today,
they have no respect.


650
00:33:22.808 --> 00:33:25.308
I think it's because of TV,

651
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:26.209
so much sex and violence.

652
00:33:26.211 --> 00:33:30.113
Yeah, who can figure what
this world's coming to?


653
00:33:55.906 --> 00:33:58.308
Wrong house.

654
00:34:03.514 --> 00:34:07.317
Son of a bitch, bastard!

655
00:34:15.594 --> 00:34:16.192
Rosalie!

656
00:34:16.194 --> 00:34:20.230
It was unbelievable.
It was by this much.


657
00:34:20.232 --> 00:34:21.698
Come on in. Sit down here.

658
00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:24.033
I appreciate your
coming over so quick.


659
00:34:24.035 --> 00:34:25.902
Well, it's okay.

660
00:34:25.904 --> 00:34:26.703
Ever hear of it?

661
00:34:26.705 --> 00:34:28.772
Trying to hit me
with a baseball bat?


662
00:34:28.774 --> 00:34:30.907
My God, it's unbelievable.

663
00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:32.442
Rosalie, what are you doing?

664
00:34:32.444 --> 00:34:34.477
Get Detective Schooner
a cup of coffee.


665
00:34:34.479 --> 00:34:36.146
No. I'm okay, Rosalie.
Thank you.


666
00:34:36.148 --> 00:34:38.314
No, she'll make you coffee
in five minutes.


667
00:34:38.316 --> 00:34:41.217
Thanks, Joey.
I'm trying to give it up.


668
00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:41.985
No, come on, please...

669
00:34:41.987 --> 00:34:46.856
You give up coffee?
Never heard of that.


670
00:34:46.858 --> 00:34:49.092
Makes me jumpy.

671
00:34:49.094 --> 00:34:51.594
Jumpy?

672
00:34:51.596 --> 00:34:55.131
Rosalie, how about
some bacon and eggs for Larry?


673
00:34:55.133 --> 00:34:55.698
He works hard.

674
00:34:55.700 --> 00:35:00.670
Nothing for me, thank you.
Rosalie, please sit down.


675
00:35:00.672 --> 00:35:04.007
I didn't come here
for breakfast, Joey.


676
00:35:04.009 --> 00:35:07.143
Okay. From the beginning.

677
00:35:07.145 --> 00:35:10.680
Sure, from the beginning.
Okay.


678
00:35:10.682 --> 00:35:13.082
Some maniac
in an Abraham Lincoln mask


679
00:35:13.084 --> 00:35:16.186
tries to brain me
with a baseball bat.


680
00:35:16.188 --> 00:35:17.153
That's the whole story.

681
00:35:17.155 --> 00:35:20.990
Yeah, could you see
what he looked like?


682
00:35:20.992 --> 00:35:23.259
Yeah, he looked like

683
00:35:23.261 --> 00:35:26.629
Abraham Lincoln
coming up to bat.


684
00:35:26.631 --> 00:35:30.433
What kind of way
is that to kill somebody?


685
00:35:30.435 --> 00:35:31.201
A baseball bat?

686
00:35:31.203 --> 00:35:33.703
Now I know why you think
murder's the national pastime.


687
00:35:33.705 --> 00:35:35.939
Baseball bat is much
cheaper than gun.


688
00:35:35.941 --> 00:35:39.075
Abraham Lincoln is cheaper
than George Washington?


689
00:35:39.077 --> 00:35:40.910
I don't know him.

690
00:35:55.226 --> 00:35:57.093
Rosalie,
where are you?


691
00:35:57.095 --> 00:35:59.128
Now what are we going to do?

692
00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:01.498
This time, I take care
of everything.


693
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.599
We'll talk tomorrow.

694
00:36:02.601 --> 00:36:04.667
This is wrong.
It's wrong.


695
00:36:04.669 --> 00:36:07.270
You leave it to me.
I do it myself.


696
00:36:07.272 --> 00:36:09.172
No! Don't do
anything.


697
00:36:09.174 --> 00:36:11.241
We'll talk tomorrow.

698
00:36:14.712 --> 00:36:16.279
What are you doing out here?

699
00:36:16.281 --> 00:36:18.515
What?

700
00:36:18.517 --> 00:36:20.817
What are you doing?

701
00:36:20.819 --> 00:36:21.951
Just getting some air.

702
00:36:21.953 --> 00:36:22.619
Come on.

703
00:36:22.621 --> 00:36:25.154
There's a maniac loose
in the neighborhood.


704
00:36:25.156 --> 00:36:26.422
Get in the house.

705
00:36:26.424 --> 00:36:28.858
What? Is everybody crazy?

706
00:36:38.103 --> 00:36:39.168
Son of a bitch!

707
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:41.804
All right, Mr. Abraham
Lincoln, son of a bitch,
bastard!


708
00:36:41.806 --> 00:36:44.774
Now what are you
going to do, huh?


709
00:36:44.776 --> 00:36:45.776
Yeah...

710
00:36:45.777 --> 00:36:46.476
What are you doing?

711
00:36:46.478 --> 00:36:48.645
Nothing. I've got my gun.

712
00:36:48.647 --> 00:36:49.979
What do you want a gun for?

713
00:36:49.981 --> 00:36:53.316
I figure that guy in the mask
is trying to rob me.


714
00:36:53.318 --> 00:36:54.017
Business is good.

715
00:36:54.019 --> 00:36:56.553
People think I carry
a lot of cash around.


716
00:36:56.555 --> 00:36:59.255
I don't like
having a gun in the house


717
00:36:59.257 --> 00:37:01.491
with the children.

718
00:37:45.502 --> 00:37:50.974
♪ Don't forget
You are my darling ♪


719
00:37:50.976 --> 00:37:55.244
♪ Don't forget to be... ♪

720
00:38:12.162 --> 00:38:14.964
Rosalie,
come on, if you're coming.


721
00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.100
Joey, wait up.

722
00:38:17.102 --> 00:38:19.302
I'm not a track star.

723
00:38:19.603 --> 00:38:20.603
What's the matter?

724
00:38:20.605 --> 00:38:22.705
Look what he did to this bush.

725
00:38:22.707 --> 00:38:24.540
Come on. Let's go.

726
00:38:30.547 --> 00:38:31.981
No! No, stop!

727
00:38:31.983 --> 00:38:35.251
Wait! Wait.
No, wait.


728
00:38:35.253 --> 00:38:36.586
What's wrong?

729
00:38:36.588 --> 00:38:38.121
What are you doing?

730
00:38:38.123 --> 00:38:39.856
Going to work.

731
00:38:39.858 --> 00:38:40.423
No, wait.

732
00:38:40.425 --> 00:38:41.858
What's the matter with you?

733
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.726
You never go to work together.

734
00:38:43.728 --> 00:38:45.962
So today, we go together.

735
00:38:45.964 --> 00:38:46.796
I didn't like the way

736
00:38:46.798 --> 00:38:49.098
my car sounded this morning,

737
00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.299
so would you look at it?

738
00:38:50.301 --> 00:38:51.701
It's very bad luck

739
00:38:51.703 --> 00:38:55.605
for man and woman to go
together in car on Wednesday,


740
00:38:55.607 --> 00:38:56.539
when it's raining.

741
00:38:56.541 --> 00:38:58.441
It's raining. So what?

742
00:38:58.443 --> 00:38:59.842
It's wet.

743
00:38:59.844 --> 00:39:02.311
Rain is always wet.

744
00:39:02.313 --> 00:39:03.146
The streets are wet.

745
00:39:03.148 --> 00:39:04.313
Mama Nadja, what are you doing?

746
00:39:04.315 --> 00:39:05.248
What's the matter with you?

747
00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:07.083
What the hell's wrong with you?

748
00:39:07.085 --> 00:39:07.617
It's Wednesday.

749
00:39:07.619 --> 00:39:10.820
Do you mind?
We've got to go to work.


750
00:39:10.822 --> 00:39:14.057
Traffic is bad on Wednesdays,

751
00:39:14.059 --> 00:39:15.324
especially when streets are wet.

752
00:39:15.326 --> 00:39:17.360
You want me to stay home
because of traffic?


753
00:39:17.362 --> 00:39:19.562
I want Rosalie to stay home

754
00:39:19.564 --> 00:39:22.932
and help me with
the housecleaning.


755
00:39:22.934 --> 00:39:26.069
Housecleaning?

756
00:39:26.071 --> 00:39:27.403
I've got work to do.

757
00:39:27.405 --> 00:39:28.771
No!

758
00:39:35.646 --> 00:39:37.580
What's the matter with you two?

759
00:39:44.688 --> 00:39:45.688
Why didn't you tell me

760
00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:47.056
you were going to
blow up the car?


761
00:39:47.058 --> 00:39:49.192
I thought it would be
a nice surprise for you.


762
00:39:49.194 --> 00:39:52.662
Mama, we're not talking about
a birthday party.


763
00:39:52.664 --> 00:39:55.264
We're supposed
to be killing him, not me.


764
00:39:55.266 --> 00:39:58.367
I don't know what goes wrong.

765
00:39:58.369 --> 00:40:00.770
I run a wire
from distributor cap


766
00:40:00.772 --> 00:40:03.106
to spark plug in gas tank.

767
00:40:03.108 --> 00:40:05.775
I figure when
he starts car, boom!


768
00:40:05.777 --> 00:40:07.176
Whole thing goes up.

769
00:40:07.178 --> 00:40:08.411
Bye-bye, Joey.

770
00:40:08.413 --> 00:40:10.379
Joey shouldn't die that way.

771
00:40:10.381 --> 00:40:12.615
That's a terrible way to die.

772
00:40:12.617 --> 00:40:13.516
Well, how should he die?

773
00:40:13.518 --> 00:40:17.653
I don't know,
but something a little more...


774
00:40:17.655 --> 00:40:19.889
Nicer?

775
00:40:19.891 --> 00:40:23.426
I'll think about it.

776
00:40:23.428 --> 00:40:24.694
He's still my husband.

777
00:40:24.696 --> 00:40:27.430
You said yourself you hate him.

778
00:40:27.432 --> 00:40:30.533
When I think of
all the women he's been with...


779
00:40:30.535 --> 00:40:31.601
Oh, God, Mama!

780
00:40:31.603 --> 00:40:32.435
He cheats on you

781
00:40:32.437 --> 00:40:34.737
and makes a fool of you.

782
00:40:34.739 --> 00:40:35.471
I know. I know.

783
00:40:35.473 --> 00:40:38.841
Rosalie, please,
if you don't kill him,


784
00:40:38.843 --> 00:40:39.542
kill yourself.

785
00:40:39.544 --> 00:40:41.544
<i>I'm sure that can be arranged.</i>

786
00:40:41.546 --> 00:40:44.514
<i>I see the code</i>
<i>specifically states...</i>


787
00:40:45.382 --> 00:40:48.751
<i>Stand fast in the ranks!</i>

788
00:40:48.753 --> 00:40:51.187
<i>You speak to me of code?</i>

789
00:40:51.189 --> 00:40:53.790
<i>What code?</i>

790
00:40:53.792 --> 00:40:56.759
<i>A coward's code.</i>

791
00:40:56.761 --> 00:41:00.930
<i>What do you know of</i>
<i>the Soldier's Code?</i>


792
00:41:00.932 --> 00:41:03.733
A lot of pepper.

793
00:41:07.738 --> 00:41:10.139
Some nice oregano.

794
00:41:10.141 --> 00:41:12.742
And a little basil.

795
00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:19.816
A lot of sleeping pills.

796
00:41:21.285 --> 00:41:23.886
You sure he won't come in here?

797
00:41:23.888 --> 00:41:24.987
Joey? Not a chance.

798
00:41:24.989 --> 00:41:29.525
He expects to be waited on
hand and foot.


799
00:41:29.527 --> 00:41:31.594
Mama, don't taste it.

800
00:41:31.596 --> 00:41:33.329
Needs more pepper.

801
00:41:33.331 --> 00:41:36.666
Make it spicy.

802
00:41:36.668 --> 00:41:38.367
A little salt.

803
00:41:38.369 --> 00:41:41.270
And a splash of wine.

804
00:41:43.941 --> 00:41:47.143
And a lot of sleeping pills.

805
00:41:48.645 --> 00:41:50.746
How much did you put in so far?

806
00:41:50.748 --> 00:41:52.315
Two whole bottles.

807
00:41:52.317 --> 00:41:52.882
What?

808
00:41:52.884 --> 00:41:54.917
Should be enough to kill anyone.

809
00:41:54.919 --> 00:41:56.652
Even Joey.

810
00:41:57.788 --> 00:41:59.222
<i>He's going to do it.</i>

811
00:41:59.224 --> 00:42:02.592
<i>Believe me,</i>
<i>he's really going to do it.</i>


812
00:42:02.594 --> 00:42:04.794
Here you go.

813
00:42:06.163 --> 00:42:09.265
<i>I warn you, 
Colonel Saito.</i>

814
00:42:09.267 --> 00:42:10.099
Where are the kids?

815
00:42:10.101 --> 00:42:13.369
They're at Aunt Lucy's
for the weekend.


816
00:42:16.807 --> 00:42:20.576
Make sure he eats it.

817
00:42:23.814 --> 00:42:25.281
What are you looking at?

818
00:42:25.283 --> 00:42:27.617
How's your spaghetti?

819
00:42:27.619 --> 00:42:30.119
Okay.

820
00:42:30.121 --> 00:42:33.356
There's plenty more.

821
00:42:40.297 --> 00:42:43.466
It's the best spaghetti
ever, Rosalie.


822
00:42:43.468 --> 00:42:49.839
See, nice and spicy,
just like my mother's.


823
00:42:52.142 --> 00:42:54.844
That's okay.

824
00:43:00.117 --> 00:43:01.884
Too bad the kids
are at Aunt Lucy's.


825
00:43:01.886 --> 00:43:04.887
They're missing a great meal.

826
00:43:17.367 --> 00:43:18.501
One more helping.

827
00:43:18.503 --> 00:43:22.371
And bring me another beer.

828
00:43:23.373 --> 00:43:27.376
What's the matter?
You're not hungry?


829
00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:48.564
I don't feel so good.

830
00:43:48.566 --> 00:43:52.635
No?

831
00:43:52.637 --> 00:43:54.537
A little stomachache.

832
00:43:54.539 --> 00:43:55.638
Is that all?

833
00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.440
What do you mean,
"Is that all?"


834
00:43:57.442 --> 00:43:59.308
What do you want me to have?

835
00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:01.777
Maybe you should take something.

836
00:44:01.779 --> 00:44:03.145
Like what?

837
00:44:03.147 --> 00:44:06.482
How about some more spaghetti?

838
00:44:06.484 --> 00:44:07.750
Spaghetti?

839
00:44:07.752 --> 00:44:09.585
Settles the stomach.

840
00:44:09.587 --> 00:44:12.588
I'll go get some.

841
00:44:15.092 --> 00:44:16.092
I don't know.

842
00:44:16.094 --> 00:44:17.994
Maybe I didn't give him enough.

843
00:44:17.996 --> 00:44:20.730
But he had three whole bowls.

844
00:44:20.732 --> 00:44:21.397
What an ox.

845
00:44:21.399 --> 00:44:23.899
Well, Joey is not a normal man.

846
00:44:23.901 --> 00:44:24.901
You know how he is.

847
00:44:24.902 --> 00:44:28.504
Works 14, 15 hours a day,

848
00:44:28.506 --> 00:44:29.472
seven days a week,

849
00:44:29.474 --> 00:44:33.242
never sleeps more than
two or three hours a night.


850
00:44:33.244 --> 00:44:37.013
Out with a different woman
every night.


851
00:44:37.015 --> 00:44:38.080
Rosalie...

852
00:44:38.082 --> 00:44:43.219
He eats anything he wants,
never gains any weight.


853
00:44:43.221 --> 00:44:44.587
He's not human.

854
00:44:44.589 --> 00:44:47.356
It's like some kind of animal.

855
00:44:47.358 --> 00:44:49.058
We're dealing with a machine.

856
00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.593
Rosalie!
What?


857
00:44:50.595 --> 00:44:53.929
I feel better now.

858
00:44:53.931 --> 00:44:59.068
I had a good crap.
That's all I needed.


859
00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:04.640
What a beautiful night!

860
00:45:10.814 --> 00:45:13.082

Monopoly.

871
00:46:25.956 --> 00:46:30.659
<i>Whoa, the Wild Hare</i>

872
00:46:30.661 --> 00:46:31.494
<i>A close call.</i>

873
00:46:31.496 --> 00:46:32.795
<i>That's what it looks like,</i>

874
00:46:32.797 --> 00:46:35.097
<i>but we'll wait</i>

875
00:46:35.099 --> 00:46:36.198
No more.

876
00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.234
You finish it.

877
00:46:38.236 --> 00:46:41.270
<i>A starting-line launch</i>

878
00:46:41.272 --> 00:46:44.340

880
00:46:50.281 --> 00:46:54.750
Joey? Joey?

881
00:47:04.561 --> 00:47:05.561
What are you doing?

882
00:47:05.563 --> 00:47:06.629
We shoot him.

883
00:47:06.631 --> 00:47:07.229
No! No.

884
00:47:07.231 --> 00:47:09.598
But we have to.
We can't go back now.


885
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:10.466
No, we've gone too far.

886
00:47:10.468 --> 00:47:13.836
If we take him to the hospital,

887
00:47:13.838 --> 00:47:16.805
they find him full of dreamies.

888
00:47:16.807 --> 00:47:19.708
They'll know
we tried to kill him.


889
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:21.577
We have no choice.

890
00:47:21.579 --> 00:47:23.345
We can't do that.

891
00:47:23.347 --> 00:47:24.780
We can't shoot him, Mama.

892
00:47:24.782 --> 00:47:25.948
We can't?
No!


893
00:47:32.622 --> 00:47:35.591
Okay, we get Devo.

894
00:47:35.593 --> 00:47:37.026
His brother was in Marines.

895
00:47:37.028 --> 00:47:39.962
He knows guns.

896
00:47:47.371 --> 00:47:49.572
Hello.

897
00:47:49.574 --> 00:47:51.140
Devo, it's Nadja.

898
00:47:51.142 --> 00:47:52.208
Hey, Nadja.

899
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:53.375
Are you alone?

900
00:47:53.377 --> 00:47:54.443
Yeah, why?

901
00:47:54.445 --> 00:47:55.044
Good.

902
00:47:55.046 --> 00:47:56.445
Devo, you know how
you feel about Rosalie?


903
00:47:56.447 --> 00:48:00.883
How you say how much
you like her?


904
00:48:00.885 --> 00:48:02.117
I love Rosalie.

905
00:48:02.119 --> 00:48:04.587
And how you would do
anything for her?


906
00:48:04.589 --> 00:48:05.754
Yes, anything.
Absolutely.


907
00:48:05.756 --> 00:48:10.359
Anything?
Yeah, anything. Why?


908
00:48:10.361 --> 00:48:12.528
You are a good boy, very sweet.

909
00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:16.465
I want you to do a little favor

910
00:48:16.467 --> 00:48:17.066
for Rosalie and me.

911
00:48:17.068 --> 00:48:19.835
You come to the house,
I'll tell you what it is.


912
00:48:19.837 --> 00:48:22.171
Okay.

913
00:48:32.349 --> 00:48:34.483
Wait a moment. 
Wait a minute.

914
00:48:34.485 --> 00:48:37.019
The bedspread is very precious.

915
00:48:37.021 --> 00:48:38.988
Don't ruin it.

916
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:41.857
Okay. On his back.

917
00:49:08.385 --> 00:49:09.385
You know what to do.

918
00:49:09.387 --> 00:49:11.620
Wait. Where
are you going?


919
00:49:11.622 --> 00:49:12.321
I can't watch.

920
00:49:12.323 --> 00:49:13.822
I can't do this alone.

921
00:49:13.824 --> 00:49:14.690
He's my husband.

922
00:49:14.692 --> 00:49:16.292
Do you want him dead or not?

923
00:49:16.294 --> 00:49:18.861
I want him dead,
but I don't want him hurt.


924
00:49:18.863 --> 00:49:20.663
He won't get hurt.
He won't.


925
00:49:20.665 --> 00:49:22.998
He's sound asleep.

926
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.233
Yeah.

927
00:49:24.235 --> 00:49:26.669
We're keeping him
asleep forever.


928
00:49:26.671 --> 00:49:27.836
I can't watch.

929
00:49:27.838 --> 00:49:29.405
Rosalie!

930
00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:43.018
How long has it been?

931
00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:48.590
Pretty soon, Joey wakes up.
Then what?


932
00:49:51.528 --> 00:49:54.229
I can't do it.
I'm going to stop him.


933
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:01.837
Are you all right?

934
00:50:01.839 --> 00:50:02.938
Am I all right?

935
00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:03.572
Am I all...

936
00:50:03.574 --> 00:50:05.341
Why are you asking me
if I'm all right?


937
00:50:05.343 --> 00:50:07.543
He's the one who got shot.

938
00:50:07.545 --> 00:50:08.377
You'd better sit down.

939
00:50:08.379 --> 00:50:10.813
No! I don't
want to sit down.


940
00:50:10.815 --> 00:50:12.781
What about Joey?

941
00:50:12.783 --> 00:50:14.183
Is he alive or dead?

942
00:50:14.185 --> 00:50:17.753
I don't know.

943
00:50:17.755 --> 00:50:19.588
Blood.

944
00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:21.390
No, tomato sauce.

945
00:50:21.392 --> 00:50:22.124
Tomato sauce?

946
00:50:22.126 --> 00:50:24.526
Did you shoot him or not?

947
00:50:24.528 --> 00:50:25.928
I think so.

948
00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:27.663
What do you mean?
I heard a shot.


949
00:50:27.665 --> 00:50:31.233
I shot him, but I don't know
if I hit him.


950
00:50:31.235 --> 00:50:33.702
I mean, I turned my head away
at the last second.


951
00:50:33.704 --> 00:50:34.370
I'm sorry,

952
00:50:34.372 --> 00:50:35.804
but I couldn't bear to watch.

953
00:50:35.806 --> 00:50:37.272
I thought you knew about guns.

954
00:50:37.274 --> 00:50:39.641
I never shot anyone before.

955
00:50:39.643 --> 00:50:41.610
Oh, don't worry.
I understand.


956
00:50:41.612 --> 00:50:43.412
There's a first time
for everything.


957
00:50:43.414 --> 00:50:46.081
I read about
a dental hygienist...


958
00:50:46.083 --> 00:50:48.751
Mama, never mind.

959
00:50:50.587 --> 00:50:52.788
Oh, wait.
There's some blood.


960
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:56.058
Let me see.

961
00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:57.092
What is it?

962
00:50:57.094 --> 00:50:59.995
I think it's a bullet hole.
It's very small.


963
00:50:59.997 --> 00:51:03.899
A bullet hole?
Are you sure?


964
00:51:03.901 --> 00:51:05.200
Yes, I'm sure.

965
00:51:05.202 --> 00:51:06.535
Is he dead?

966
00:51:06.537 --> 00:51:08.871
Joey? Joey? Joey?

967
00:51:08.873 --> 00:51:11.907
Rosalie.
What?


968
00:51:12.208 --> 00:51:16.745
I don't feel so hot.
Got a little headache.


969
00:51:16.747 --> 00:51:20.516
My stomach don't feel
so hot neither.


970
00:51:20.518 --> 00:51:22.384
You got a virus, honey.

971
00:51:22.386 --> 00:51:24.753
That's all, a virus.

972
00:51:24.755 --> 00:51:28.424
Virus? How can you tell?

973
00:51:28.426 --> 00:51:31.059
Dr. Lowe was here.

974
00:51:31.061 --> 00:51:32.561
He was?

975
00:51:32.563 --> 00:51:33.829
Yeah.

976
00:51:33.831 --> 00:51:34.596
I don't remember.

977
00:51:34.598 --> 00:51:39.067
Yeah, he was here,
and he gave you a shot.


978
00:51:39.069 --> 00:51:40.869
Ohh...

979
00:51:42.806 --> 00:51:46.608
Can I get a glass of water?

980
00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:47.209
Rosalie?

981
00:51:47.211 --> 00:51:50.946
Maybe I take
a couple of aspirin too.


982
00:51:50.948 --> 00:51:52.548
Oh, okay.

983
00:51:58.788 --> 00:52:00.722
Whoa.

984
00:52:02.625 --> 00:52:05.260
What are we
going to do?


985
00:52:05.695 --> 00:52:08.030
You're going to have
to shoot him again.


986
00:52:08.032 --> 00:52:08.797
No. I can't.

987
00:52:08.799 --> 00:52:11.200
I can't believe I did it
the first time.


988
00:52:11.202 --> 00:52:17.239
I can't believe
you let me do that.


989
00:52:17.241 --> 00:52:17.840
If you can't do it,

990
00:52:17.842 --> 00:52:19.475
you have to find
someone who can.


991
00:52:19.477 --> 00:52:21.276
I'll put up the money.

992
00:52:21.278 --> 00:52:22.110
We need professionals.

993
00:52:22.112 --> 00:52:23.512
This has to be done right away.

994
00:52:23.514 --> 00:52:24.947
Oh, you know someone?

995
00:52:24.949 --> 00:52:29.418
I need to collect myself.

996
00:52:34.724 --> 00:52:37.526
All right, get a grip.

997
00:52:37.528 --> 00:52:41.897
Get your shit together.
Okay? Okay. Let's go.


998
00:52:45.134 --> 00:52:46.401
How much can we pay?

999
00:52:46.403 --> 00:52:50.439
As much as we have to.

1000
00:52:50.441 --> 00:52:51.640
Yeah, not too much, though.

1001
00:52:51.642 --> 00:52:54.743
You know, try for discount.

1002
00:53:16.499 --> 00:53:18.734
Is there a Harlan James here?

1003
00:53:18.736 --> 00:53:21.904
In the back, Devo.

1004
00:53:32.615 --> 00:53:35.751
Hello, Harlan, how's it going?

1005
00:53:46.729 --> 00:53:49.064
Devo.

1006
00:53:49.066 --> 00:53:51.967
What do you say?

1007
00:53:58.308 --> 00:53:59.641
You know my cousin Marlon?

1008
00:53:59.643 --> 00:54:04.513
Well, of course I do.
How are you, Marlon?


1009
00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:09.918
What?

1010
00:54:22.265 --> 00:54:23.732
$300 is not much.

1011
00:54:23.734 --> 00:54:26.768
He's already dying.

1012
00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:29.438
All you have to do
is finish him off.


1013
00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:32.574
It's still...

1014
00:54:36.312 --> 00:54:39.348
It's still murder!

1015
00:54:39.350 --> 00:54:44.720
But I've already done
most of the work.


1016
00:54:48.891 --> 00:54:51.360
I'll tell you,
we'll do it for $600.


1017
00:54:51.362 --> 00:54:53.028
$400.

1018
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:55.564
He's practically got
one foot in the grave.


1019
00:54:55.566 --> 00:54:58.734
$550. What do you say?

1020
00:54:59.802 --> 00:55:03.071
If we're going to
waste the dude,


1021
00:55:03.073 --> 00:55:06.908
we ought to get
paid for it, man.


1022
00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:12.014
That's the American way, right?

1023
00:55:12.016 --> 00:55:12.614
Yeah.

1024
00:55:12.616 --> 00:55:16.418
Yeah, I mean, we're not...
communists here, you know?


1025
00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:19.187
We're Americans.
We got a right to make
a living.


1026
00:55:19.189 --> 00:55:24.693
$500. That's my final offer.

1027
00:55:34.871 --> 00:55:37.005
You tell him.

1028
00:55:42.345 --> 00:55:43.345
Okay.

1029
00:55:43.347 --> 00:55:46.815
How you feeling, Joey?

1030
00:55:46.817 --> 00:55:48.917
A little tired.

1031
00:55:48.919 --> 00:55:50.852
You're real sick, baby.

1032
00:55:50.854 --> 00:55:51.854
Yeah.

1033
00:55:51.855 --> 00:55:55.791
Maybe I sleep, hey?

1034
00:55:59.129 --> 00:56:01.296
What? What's happening?
Where am I?


1035
00:56:01.298 --> 00:56:04.232
You got a virus, honey.
It's okay.


1036
00:56:04.234 --> 00:56:06.134
A virus.

1037
00:56:06.136 --> 00:56:10.205
Oh, yes. I forgot.

1038
00:56:23.052 --> 00:56:24.486
Can you see anything?

1039
00:56:24.488 --> 00:56:26.755
No.

1040
00:56:26.757 --> 00:56:30.525
Wait a minute.
Here is something.


1041
00:56:34.163 --> 00:56:38.166
It's a cab.
It can't be for us.


1042
00:56:38.168 --> 00:56:39.634
Do you want a bite?

1043
00:56:39.636 --> 00:56:41.503
No.

1044
00:56:44.841 --> 00:56:47.476
Who are these guys?

1045
00:56:47.478 --> 00:56:48.910
$8.50, please.

1046
00:56:48.912 --> 00:56:49.745
What's going on?

1047
00:56:49.747 --> 00:56:53.849
The meter.
Give me $8.50.


1048
00:57:14.704 --> 00:57:16.772
What are they doing?

1049
00:57:16.774 --> 00:57:19.875
I don't know.

1050
00:57:27.216 --> 00:57:29.484
They're going someplace else.

1051
00:57:29.486 --> 00:57:32.888
Guys! Over here.

1052
00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:36.057
Where are you going?

1053
00:57:36.059 --> 00:57:39.094
It's over here.

1054
00:57:41.831 --> 00:57:43.765
Rosalie!

1055
00:57:43.767 --> 00:57:47.169
It's me.

1056
00:58:06.722 --> 00:58:08.423
You took a taxi.

1057
00:58:08.425 --> 00:58:10.692
How could you do that?

1058
00:58:10.694 --> 00:58:11.793
What's wrong with that?

1059
00:58:11.795 --> 00:58:13.728
You came here to kill Joey.

1060
00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:14.329
So what?

1061
00:58:14.331 --> 00:58:16.898
So it's generally not
considered a very good idea


1062
00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.201
to take a taxi
to the scene of a crime.


1063
00:58:19.203 --> 00:58:23.872
Hey, man, look.
Be cool, okay?


1064
00:58:23.874 --> 00:58:26.474
I mean, you know,

1065
00:58:26.476 --> 00:58:29.411
the dude's only a taxi driver.

1066
00:58:29.846 --> 00:58:33.949
He's not like what's his name.

1067
00:58:36.252 --> 00:58:37.552
What's his name?

1068
00:58:37.554 --> 00:58:39.387
Who?

1069
00:58:42.258 --> 00:58:44.993
You know.

1070
00:58:44.995 --> 00:58:46.394
Yeah, right.

1071
00:58:46.396 --> 00:58:48.463
Look, never mind.

1072
00:58:48.465 --> 00:58:49.898
Forget it.
It's done. Okay?


1073
00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:52.734
This is Rosalie, Joey's wife,

1074
00:58:52.736 --> 00:58:55.637
and this is Rosalie's mother.

1075
00:58:55.639 --> 00:58:56.872
Harlan, Marlon.

1076
00:58:56.874 --> 00:58:58.506
Be careful.

1077
00:58:58.508 --> 00:59:00.976
Nice to meet you.

1078
00:59:03.546 --> 00:59:05.981
How's it going?

1079
00:59:08.818 --> 00:59:10.518
Would you like
some coffee or tea


1080
00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:13.655
or something to eat
before you...


1081
00:59:13.657 --> 00:59:16.358
Well, before you get started?

1082
00:59:20.096 --> 00:59:23.865
No. Thanks.

1083
00:59:23.867 --> 00:59:24.332
We're cool.

1084
00:59:24.334 --> 00:59:29.104
Excuse me, Harlan, Marlon.

1085
00:59:29.106 --> 00:59:29.938
Just for one second,

1086
00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:33.575
I'd like to have a word
with Devo over here.


1087
00:59:47.223 --> 00:59:48.490
They look like drug addicts.

1088
00:59:48.492 --> 00:59:49.691
Well, they are drug addicts.

1089
00:59:49.693 --> 00:59:53.395
Oh, my God! You hired
drug addicts?


1090
00:59:53.397 --> 00:59:55.563
Who did you expect me to hire,

1091
00:59:55.565 --> 00:59:56.264
the Red Cross?

1092
00:59:56.266 --> 00:59:57.599
They seem like very polite boys.

1093
00:59:57.601 --> 00:59:59.801
I don't like drug
addicts in my house.


1094
00:59:59.803 --> 01:00:03.104
Rosalie, please, don't think
of them as drug addicts.


1095
01:00:03.106 --> 01:00:05.874
Think of them as killers.

1096
01:00:11.514 --> 01:00:14.049
How can a kangaroo

1097
01:00:14.051 --> 01:00:16.918
give birth to a human baby?

1098
01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.254
It's a miracle.
It says so right here.


1099
01:00:19.256 --> 01:00:22.290
Is that legal?

1100
01:00:22.292 --> 01:00:24.459
You know...

1101
01:00:24.461 --> 01:00:26.461
having sex with a kangaroo?

1102
01:00:26.463 --> 01:00:29.230
Here it is.

1103
01:00:35.271 --> 01:00:37.405
Oh, sorry.

1104
01:00:49.852 --> 01:00:51.152
.22 caliber.

1105
01:00:51.154 --> 01:00:52.154
Not much of a gun.

1106
01:00:52.155 --> 01:00:52.921
What do you mean?

1107
01:00:52.923 --> 01:00:56.057
Well, it's kind of small,
you know?


1108
01:00:56.059 --> 01:00:57.059
Not much pop.

1109
01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:58.927
Well, that's all we've got.

1110
01:00:58.929 --> 01:01:01.529
Yeah, this is our gun.

1111
01:01:01.531 --> 01:01:05.200
Put on some music, okay?

1112
01:01:05.202 --> 01:01:05.967
Make it real loud

1113
01:01:05.969 --> 01:01:08.570
so's it drowns out
the noise of the gunshot.


1114
01:01:08.572 --> 01:01:10.572
Yeah, ooh.

1115
01:01:13.142 --> 01:01:15.810
In the back, on the right.

1116
01:01:15.812 --> 01:01:21.316
In the corner.
See the lamp? Door.


1117
01:01:27.189 --> 01:01:28.823
What is that for?

1118
01:01:28.825 --> 01:01:29.825
I don't know.

1119
01:01:29.826 --> 01:01:32.560
Just in case, you know,
like if he wakes up.


1120
01:01:32.562 --> 01:01:35.296
Oh, okay.

1121
01:01:47.443 --> 01:01:50.311
You ready?

1122
01:01:50.313 --> 01:01:53.882
Yeah, I guess.

1123
01:01:53.884 --> 01:01:58.653
How about you, Joey?
You ready?


1124
01:02:00.122 --> 01:02:01.389
Let's do it.

1125
01:02:01.391 --> 01:02:02.357
Harlan?

1126
01:02:02.359 --> 01:02:05.060
What?

1127
01:02:05.062 --> 01:02:09.564
I never killed nobody before.

1128
01:02:09.566 --> 01:02:12.434
He's already half-dead.

1129
01:02:12.436 --> 01:02:17.605
Even so, I mean...

1130
01:02:17.607 --> 01:02:18.106
you know...

1131
01:02:18.108 --> 01:02:19.407
I never killed nobody neither.

1132
01:02:19.409 --> 01:02:23.445
So what?
How hard can it be?


1133
01:02:23.447 --> 01:02:25.580
I mean, all's we do is...

1134
01:02:25.582 --> 01:02:32.153
we read him his rights
and then kill him.


1135
01:02:35.691 --> 01:02:36.691
What are you doing?

1136
01:02:36.693 --> 01:02:38.560
Looking for a record.

1137
01:02:38.562 --> 01:02:39.861
Mama, any record will do.

1138
01:02:39.863 --> 01:02:42.430
I'm looking for Johnny Mathis.

1139
01:02:42.432 --> 01:02:43.231
I love him.

1140
01:02:43.233 --> 01:02:43.932
Play this one.

1141
01:02:43.934 --> 01:02:47.635
What? Oh, Madonna?
No, Rosalie, please.


1142
01:02:47.637 --> 01:02:50.738
You know I love Johnny Mathis.

1143
01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:55.610
Where's the fucking music?

1144
01:02:55.612 --> 01:02:56.411
I don't know.

1145
01:02:56.413 --> 01:03:00.915
I don't want to sit here
all night.


1146
01:03:04.186 --> 01:03:05.753
Rosalie?

1147
01:03:15.965 --> 01:03:17.132
Look at that.

1148
01:03:17.134 --> 01:03:19.701
What?

1149
01:03:19.703 --> 01:03:24.205
That's a Reggie Jackson model.

1150
01:03:24.207 --> 01:03:26.508
Oh yeah.

1151
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:28.776
Reggie!

1152
01:03:28.778 --> 01:03:29.711
Reggie!

1153
01:03:29.713 --> 01:03:33.648
Reggie! Reggie!
Reggie!


1154
01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:34.382
I love Reggie.

1155
01:03:34.384 --> 01:03:36.684
Me too, man.
He's the greatest.


1156
01:03:36.686 --> 01:03:38.386
How many homers has he hit?

1157
01:03:38.388 --> 01:03:42.757
I mean, lifetime.

1158
01:03:42.759 --> 01:03:44.926
Shit, man.

1159
01:03:44.928 --> 01:03:48.663
Wow.

1160
01:03:48.665 --> 01:03:51.799
Fuck.

1161
01:03:51.801 --> 01:03:52.467
A bunch.

1162
01:03:52.469 --> 01:03:58.039
Reggie! Reggie! Reggie!
Reggie! Reggie!


1163
01:03:58.041 --> 01:04:00.909
They want to hear reggae music.

1164
01:04:00.911 --> 01:04:01.843
Reggae?
Yes.


1165
01:04:01.845 --> 01:04:04.679
No, it's right here somewhere.
I know it is.


1166
01:04:04.681 --> 01:04:07.882
I'll be waiting outside.

1167
01:04:07.884 --> 01:04:08.416
Why?

1168
01:04:08.418 --> 01:04:12.620
Because I can't stand
this anymore.


1169
01:04:12.622 --> 01:04:14.656
What is reggae music?

1170
01:04:21.797 --> 01:04:23.431
I'm going to shoot this dude.

1171
01:04:23.433 --> 01:04:24.866
I'm sick of waiting.

1172
01:04:24.868 --> 01:04:27.969
Where you going to shoot him?

1173
01:04:27.971 --> 01:04:28.870
Right here.

1174
01:04:28.872 --> 01:04:29.737
What do you think,

1175
01:04:29.739 --> 01:04:31.172
I'm going to take him downtown?

1176
01:04:31.174 --> 01:04:34.142
No. I mean,
where on his body?


1177
01:04:34.144 --> 01:04:37.312
Well, I don't know.
His heart, I guess.


1178
01:04:37.314 --> 01:04:41.082
Which side is that on?
His heart?


1179
01:04:41.084 --> 01:04:44.586
Oh, shit, man.
I don't know.


1180
01:04:44.588 --> 01:04:46.554
It's in there somewhere.

1181
01:04:46.556 --> 01:04:49.691
I don't hear nothing.

1182
01:04:49.693 --> 01:04:51.426
Wait a minute.

1183
01:04:52.528 --> 01:04:54.195
School.

1184
01:04:54.197 --> 01:04:54.762
What?

1185
01:04:54.764 --> 01:04:57.265
School, man, you know.
Pledge allegiance.


1186
01:04:57.267 --> 01:04:59.500
Oh, yeah.

1187
01:04:59.502 --> 01:05:01.236
Hand over your heart.

1188
01:05:01.238 --> 01:05:03.671
Yeah, right.

1189
01:05:03.673 --> 01:05:04.939
I pledge allegiance

1190
01:05:04.941 --> 01:05:08.476
to the flag of the United
States of America.


1191
01:05:08.478 --> 01:05:10.044
And to the republic...

1192
01:05:10.046 --> 01:05:13.047
under one invisible nation...

1193
01:05:13.049 --> 01:05:14.616
Nations under God whose...

1194
01:05:14.618 --> 01:05:15.618
Spacious skies

1195
01:05:15.619 --> 01:05:18.186
and amber graves of liberty
for all...


1196
01:05:18.188 --> 01:05:22.323
Deliver us from freedom.

1197
01:05:26.395 --> 01:05:27.795
Harlan.
What?


1198
01:05:27.797 --> 01:05:32.100
I can't watch this, man.

1199
01:05:41.844 --> 01:05:43.378
Pussy.

1200
01:05:44.947 --> 01:05:51.119
This side. This side.

1201
01:06:05.801 --> 01:06:08.469
Aah! Fuck!

1202
01:06:21.785 --> 01:06:23.518
You were supposed to
put it on before the shot!


1203
01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.354
Yeah, they shoots too fast.

1204
01:06:26.789 --> 01:06:28.256
Well?

1205
01:06:28.258 --> 01:06:29.424
Well, what?

1206
01:06:29.426 --> 01:06:30.291
Is he dead?

1207
01:06:30.293 --> 01:06:32.193
Of course he's dead, man.

1208
01:06:32.195 --> 01:06:35.196
What do you think?

1209
01:06:35.198 --> 01:06:37.231
<i>I</i> shot him.

1210
01:06:46.575 --> 01:06:49.043
What's the matter?
What happened?


1211
01:06:49.045 --> 01:06:51.312
She's upset.

1212
01:06:51.314 --> 01:06:52.380
She'll be all right.

1213
01:06:52.382 --> 01:06:54.682
I thought she wanted him dead.

1214
01:06:55.685 --> 01:06:56.884
What did we do, man?

1215
01:06:56.886 --> 01:06:59.454
Did we kill the wrong person?

1216
01:06:59.456 --> 01:07:00.054
No, no.

1217
01:07:00.056 --> 01:07:03.324
No, she'll be all right.

1218
01:07:03.326 --> 01:07:07.328
We leave her alone now.

1219
01:07:08.697 --> 01:07:10.932
It's the shock, you know.

1220
01:07:10.934 --> 01:07:11.866
The music.

1221
01:07:11.868 --> 01:07:13.067
I could use a drink.

1222
01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:13.868
Yeah.

1223
01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:15.636
Yeah, okay.
Yeah. Ooh.


1224
01:07:15.638 --> 01:07:16.638
Good idea.

1225
01:07:16.639 --> 01:07:17.639
Come.

1226
01:07:29.118 --> 01:07:31.319
What should we drink to?

1227
01:07:31.321 --> 01:07:33.154
Here's to Joey.

1228
01:07:39.229 --> 01:07:43.131
That's cool.

1229
01:07:43.766 --> 01:07:45.600
It's wrong.

1230
01:07:45.602 --> 01:07:47.335
It's wrong.

1231
01:07:47.337 --> 01:07:49.504
Oh, dear Lord.

1232
01:07:49.506 --> 01:07:52.240
Oh, please help me, God.

1233
01:07:52.242 --> 01:07:55.710
Oh, I never should have
done this thing.


1234
01:07:55.712 --> 01:07:59.580
I never should have
sinned this way. Ohh...


1235
01:07:59.582 --> 01:08:01.382
I never...

1236
01:08:01.384 --> 01:08:06.521
Whatever you do to me, God,
please bring Joey back.


1237
01:08:06.523 --> 01:08:08.956
Rosalie?

1238
01:08:08.958 --> 01:08:10.324
Aah!

1239
01:08:10.392 --> 01:08:13.027
What? What?

1240
01:08:15.731 --> 01:08:18.633
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1241
01:08:19.401 --> 01:08:20.701
What... oh!

1242
01:08:20.703 --> 01:08:25.940
What... what are you
doing here?


1243
01:08:25.942 --> 01:08:28.276
I was praying.

1244
01:08:28.278 --> 01:08:29.577
I thought...

1245
01:08:29.579 --> 01:08:32.213
Praying?

1246
01:08:32.215 --> 01:08:34.382
Yeah.

1247
01:08:37.586 --> 01:08:41.889
Rosalie... I'm not that sick.

1248
01:08:41.891 --> 01:08:43.825
All I got is what?

1249
01:08:43.827 --> 01:08:45.860
A little virus.
That's all.


1250
01:08:45.862 --> 01:08:46.594
Joey.

1251
01:08:46.596 --> 01:08:49.230
What are you doing up?

1252
01:08:49.232 --> 01:08:52.600
I heard a noise

1253
01:08:52.602 --> 01:08:54.802
like firecracker or something.

1254
01:08:54.804 --> 01:08:55.736
Woke me up.

1255
01:08:55.738 --> 01:08:57.472
Jesus.

1256
01:08:58.541 --> 01:09:05.213
Rosalie, how come you don't...?

1257
01:09:05.215 --> 01:09:07.248
You know...

1258
01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:08.115
we have company.

1259
01:09:08.117 --> 01:09:10.184
You're not feeding them.

1260
01:09:10.186 --> 01:09:11.052
What's the matter?

1261
01:09:11.054 --> 01:09:15.723
We got no food in
the house, or what?


1262
01:09:15.725 --> 01:09:18.426
They're not hungry, Joey.

1263
01:09:18.428 --> 01:09:21.996
They don't want anything to eat.

1264
01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:27.001
I don't know...

1265
01:09:27.003 --> 01:09:29.770
Do I know everybody?

1266
01:09:36.545 --> 01:09:38.813
Uh, yeah.

1267
01:09:40.215 --> 01:09:43.117
Well... um...

1268
01:09:44.787 --> 01:09:45.887
Is he okay?

1269
01:09:45.889 --> 01:09:47.154
Yeah.

1270
01:09:47.156 --> 01:09:48.956
I'm Marlon...

1271
01:09:50.926 --> 01:09:53.461
I mean, I'm William.

1272
01:09:53.463 --> 01:09:56.531
I'm William Brown.

1273
01:09:56.533 --> 01:09:59.066
I'm Louie...

1274
01:09:59.068 --> 01:10:00.434
James. No.

1275
01:10:00.436 --> 01:10:03.204
No, wait.

1276
01:10:03.206 --> 01:10:05.406
Louie...

1277
01:10:05.408 --> 01:10:06.574
Smith?

1278
01:10:06.576 --> 01:10:08.209
Smith.

1279
01:10:08.211 --> 01:10:10.344
Joey's Pizza.

1280
01:10:13.882 --> 01:10:17.552
Some cheese and crackers?

1281
01:10:17.554 --> 01:10:21.455
Maybe some pretzels, huh?

1282
01:10:21.457 --> 01:10:25.092
How are you feeling, Joey?

1283
01:10:25.094 --> 01:10:26.327
You feeling all right?

1284
01:10:26.329 --> 01:10:29.830
Thank you.

1285
01:10:34.136 --> 01:10:35.269
What?

1286
01:10:35.271 --> 01:10:38.205
Feeling okay?

1287
01:10:38.207 --> 01:10:40.641
Uh...

1288
01:10:40.643 --> 01:10:44.612
No, I don't feel so hot. No.

1289
01:10:59.528 --> 01:11:01.596
Hello, Devo.

1290
01:11:03.632 --> 01:11:04.632
Honey.

1291
01:11:04.634 --> 01:11:06.968
Joey... you shouldn't be
out of bed.


1292
01:11:06.970 --> 01:11:09.236
You got a bad virus.

1293
01:11:09.238 --> 01:11:11.138
Come on.

1294
01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:12.306
You're telling me.

1295
01:11:12.308 --> 01:11:16.877
It's killing me, this virus.

1296
01:11:16.879 --> 01:11:21.349
Well, good night, everybody.

1297
01:11:23.652 --> 01:11:24.652
Whoops.

1298
01:11:24.654 --> 01:11:27.955
Joey, pull your pants up.

1299
01:11:30.292 --> 01:11:33.194
Nice to meet you.

1300
01:11:33.962 --> 01:11:35.596
You sure they're not hungry?

1301
01:11:35.598 --> 01:11:37.098
I'm positive, baby.

1302
01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:40.368
We could send out for Chinese.

1303
01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:42.136
No, they don't want anything.

1304
01:11:42.138 --> 01:11:44.939
We got spaghetti.

1305
01:11:44.941 --> 01:11:48.876
I am very disappointed.

1306
01:11:48.878 --> 01:11:52.680
Nice guys.

1307
01:11:53.583 --> 01:11:54.782
Ooh, you okay?

1308
01:11:54.784 --> 01:11:56.584
What?

1309
01:11:57.719 --> 01:11:59.487
We got any meatballs left?

1310
01:11:59.489 --> 01:12:01.555
What, are you hungry?

1311
01:12:01.557 --> 01:12:02.456
Could eat a little something.

1312
01:12:02.458 --> 01:12:06.060
You know, get my strength back.

1313
01:12:06.062 --> 01:12:09.096
Come on. Sorry.

1314
01:12:09.098 --> 01:12:11.565
What time is it?

1315
01:12:11.567 --> 01:12:12.567
It's late.

1316
01:12:12.568 --> 01:12:16.637
You should try to sleep.

1317
01:12:16.639 --> 01:12:20.775
You take good care of me,
Rosalie.


1318
01:12:20.777 --> 01:12:25.079
I know you do.

1319
01:12:25.081 --> 01:12:28.849
You're my husband.

1320
01:12:28.851 --> 01:12:30.951
Rosalie.

1321
01:12:30.953 --> 01:12:34.021
Yeah?

1322
01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.194
Oh, Joey, no.

1323
01:12:40.196 --> 01:12:43.597
No, not now. Come on.

1324
01:12:43.599 --> 01:12:47.301
Just lie quietly, okay?

1325
01:12:58.213 --> 01:12:59.380
This is only 200.

1326
01:12:59.382 --> 01:13:01.549
We was promised five.

1327
01:13:01.551 --> 01:13:02.650
For killing him, five.

1328
01:13:02.652 --> 01:13:04.285
For wounding him, two.

1329
01:13:04.287 --> 01:13:07.822
Well, you wanted me
to shoot him, right?


1330
01:13:07.824 --> 01:13:08.956
So I shot him.

1331
01:13:08.958 --> 01:13:14.595
You woke him up.
What good is that?


1332
01:13:24.573 --> 01:13:27.441
Okay.

1333
01:13:37.319 --> 01:13:38.319
Next time we do this,

1334
01:13:38.321 --> 01:13:41.622
we're going to get
paid in advance.


1335
01:13:41.624 --> 01:13:42.723
If we keep shooting Joey,

1336
01:13:42.725 --> 01:13:46.994
don't you think he might
get suspicious?


1337
01:13:48.697 --> 01:13:51.031
Larry.

1338
01:13:54.703 --> 01:13:56.937
Tell him what you told me.

1339
01:13:56.939 --> 01:13:57.772
I want to make a deal.

1340
01:13:57.774 --> 01:13:59.673
Not that, the other thing.

1341
01:13:59.675 --> 01:14:01.942
There's not enough
heat in my cell.


1342
01:14:01.944 --> 01:14:04.812
No, Harlan and Marlon.

1343
01:14:04.814 --> 01:14:05.746
Oh yeah.

1344
01:14:05.748 --> 01:14:07.081
Harlan James
and his cousin Marlon.


1345
01:14:07.083 --> 01:14:09.216
I heard they was paid
a lot of money


1346
01:14:09.218 --> 01:14:12.386
to hit Joey Boca.

1347
01:14:12.388 --> 01:14:15.256
Joey Boca? Why?

1348
01:14:15.258 --> 01:14:16.857
I don't know.
That's what I heard, you know?


1349
01:14:16.859 --> 01:14:19.026
Harlan and Marlon
was buying drinks for everyone


1350
01:14:19.028 --> 01:14:19.827
and bragging on it.

1351
01:14:19.829 --> 01:14:25.733
Said they shot the dude.
Said they got $5,000.


1352
01:14:40.615 --> 01:14:42.983
It's kind of late.
Maybe they're asleep.


1353
01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.520
I'd better answer.
I have to.


1354
01:14:46.522 --> 01:14:49.156
No. No. Rosalie...

1355
01:14:49.158 --> 01:14:52.660
Now, look, whatever happens,
let me do the talking.


1356
01:14:52.662 --> 01:14:55.196
Mama, I don't want you
to say anything.


1357
01:14:55.198 --> 01:14:56.096
What?

1358
01:14:56.098 --> 01:14:56.797
You too, Devo.

1359
01:14:56.799 --> 01:14:58.365
There's no sense everyone
getting in trouble.


1360
01:14:58.367 --> 01:15:00.901
But I don't want you
to get in trouble.


1361
01:15:00.903 --> 01:15:05.139
Anyway, Joey's not dead,
you know.


1362
01:15:05.141 --> 01:15:08.776
All we did was put him to
sleep and wake him up a
few times.


1363
01:15:08.778 --> 01:15:10.711
Mama, he has two bullets in him.

1364
01:15:10.713 --> 01:15:12.046
He could be dying.

1365
01:15:12.048 --> 01:15:15.382
So how come he wants meatballs?

1366
01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:23.557
Evening, Rosalie.

1367
01:15:23.559 --> 01:15:26.393
Is something wrong?

1368
01:15:26.395 --> 01:15:27.528
May we come in?

1369
01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:29.430
Oh, you mean now?

1370
01:15:29.432 --> 01:15:31.165
We'd like to see Joey.

1371
01:15:31.167 --> 01:15:32.466
Joey?

1372
01:15:32.468 --> 01:15:34.168
Your husband. Joey.

1373
01:15:34.170 --> 01:15:37.872
Oh, yeah, Joey. Oh, Joey.

1374
01:15:37.874 --> 01:15:39.640
Uh, well, he's not feeling
well right now.


1375
01:15:39.642 --> 01:15:42.977
Maybe you could come back
in a couple of days?


1376
01:15:42.979 --> 01:15:43.711
Joey very sick.

1377
01:15:43.713 --> 01:15:45.145
You come back some other time.

1378
01:15:45.147 --> 01:15:47.548
We'd like to see him tonight.

1379
01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:48.082
Maybe tomorrow.

1380
01:15:48.084 --> 01:15:53.754
Rosalie, if we have to,
we'll come back
with a warrant.


1381
01:15:57.392 --> 01:15:59.126
Joey?

1382
01:15:59.128 --> 01:16:04.231
Hey, Larry, how you doing?

1383
01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:07.668
You all right?

1384
01:16:07.670 --> 01:16:09.970
I got a little virus.

1385
01:16:09.972 --> 01:16:10.871
A virus?

1386
01:16:10.873 --> 01:16:13.474
Yes, some kind of virus.

1387
01:16:13.476 --> 01:16:15.843
I got a headache.

1388
01:16:15.845 --> 01:16:18.178
You mind if I turn on the light?

1389
01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:20.514
Sure. Go ahead.

1390
01:16:20.516 --> 01:16:23.450
I don't think you should.

1391
01:16:23.452 --> 01:16:24.452
Just for a second.

1392
01:16:24.453 --> 01:16:26.086
It doesn't work, anyway.

1393
01:16:26.088 --> 01:16:27.688
Oh.

1394
01:16:33.295 --> 01:16:36.664
Get you nice and comfortable.

1395
01:16:37.399 --> 01:16:39.800
Excuse me, Rosalie.
Excuse me, please.


1396
01:16:39.802 --> 01:16:44.972
Please, excuse me.
Thank you.


1397
01:16:53.415 --> 01:16:54.515
Jesus.

1398
01:16:54.517 --> 01:16:56.083
What?

1399
01:16:56.085 --> 01:16:57.818
What the hell's going on here?

1400
01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:00.454
He's been shot in the head.

1401
01:17:00.456 --> 01:17:02.957
Really?
What?


1402
01:17:02.959 --> 01:17:04.959
No wonder he has headache.

1403
01:17:04.961 --> 01:17:07.795
Headache?
He's got a bullet in him.


1404
01:17:07.797 --> 01:17:12.032
Carlos, get an ambulance
over here right away.


1405
01:17:12.034 --> 01:17:14.034
Devo!

1406
01:17:14.036 --> 01:17:17.838
I was going to get a Band-Aid
for Joey.


1407
01:17:19.074 --> 01:17:20.674
Yeah, this is Detective
Carlos Wiley.


1408
01:17:20.676 --> 01:17:23.143
I'm at 424 North C,
as in "Charlie."


1409
01:17:23.145 --> 01:17:26.613
We didn't do it.
I swear to God we didn't.


1410
01:17:26.615 --> 01:17:29.483
We found him
outside on the lawn.


1411
01:17:29.485 --> 01:17:30.751
Yeah.
He was lying there.


1412
01:17:30.753 --> 01:17:34.588
Someone had shot him
and thrown him on the lawn.


1413
01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:35.289
It was a mess.

1414
01:17:35.291 --> 01:17:36.523
It was terrible, so we...

1415
01:17:36.525 --> 01:17:39.526
we brought him inside
and we put him in bed.


1416
01:17:39.528 --> 01:17:40.327
Yeah, like you see.

1417
01:17:40.329 --> 01:17:42.162
And it must have been the Mafia.

1418
01:17:42.164 --> 01:17:43.297
Mafia?

1419
01:17:43.299 --> 01:17:44.798
The Mafia.

1420
01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:46.600
Yeah, Joey was Italian.

1421
01:17:46.602 --> 01:17:47.368
He <i>is</i> Italian.

1422
01:17:47.370 --> 01:17:51.171
Rosalie, why didn't you take
him to the hospital?


1423
01:17:51.173 --> 01:17:52.072
He didn't want to go.

1424
01:17:52.074 --> 01:17:53.807
He wasn't feeling up to it.

1425
01:17:55.878 --> 01:18:01.949
Joey, you didn't want
to go to the hospital?


1426
01:18:01.951 --> 01:18:04.985
No. Why,
for a virus?


1427
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:17.898
Rosalie. Don't tell Rosalie.

1428
01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:43.991
How many bottles of pills

1429
01:18:43.993 --> 01:18:45.159
did you give him?

1430
01:18:45.161 --> 01:18:48.262
I gave him two bottles.
One, two.


1431
01:18:48.264 --> 01:18:53.667
Harlan and Marlon say
Devo shot him the first time.


1432
01:18:53.669 --> 01:18:54.368
Is that right?

1433
01:18:54.370 --> 01:18:56.703
Devo wouldn't even
have been there


1434
01:18:56.705 --> 01:18:57.705
if it wasn't for me.

1435
01:18:57.706 --> 01:18:58.939
How do you mean?

1436
01:18:58.941 --> 01:19:03.577
I wanted to kill Joey.
Devo had nothing to
do with it.


1437
01:19:03.579 --> 01:19:05.879
Did Devo shoot him or not?

1438
01:19:05.881 --> 01:19:06.680
What does Devo say?

1439
01:19:06.682 --> 01:19:08.282
Never mind him.
What do you say?


1440
01:19:08.284 --> 01:19:10.918
It wasn't Devo. It was me.

1441
01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:14.955
I shot him the first time,
and then...


1442
01:19:14.957 --> 01:19:18.058
Who shot him? Let me see.
It was Marlon.


1443
01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:20.461
No, no. Harlan. Harlan.

1444
01:19:20.463 --> 01:19:21.795
Are you sure?

1445
01:19:21.797 --> 01:19:25.699
Yeah, I'm sure.
Why? Who do you think
shot him?


1446
01:19:25.701 --> 01:19:26.633
What about your mother?

1447
01:19:26.635 --> 01:19:29.903
She had nothing to do with it.
Nothing.


1448
01:19:29.905 --> 01:19:32.272
Yes, I shoot him. Yes.

1449
01:19:32.274 --> 01:19:36.009
You know why?
He is no-good son of a bitch.


1450
01:19:36.011 --> 01:19:37.311
Who gave him the pills?

1451
01:19:37.313 --> 01:19:38.812
I did.
What do you think?


1452
01:19:38.814 --> 01:19:40.647
First I give him sleeping pills,

1453
01:19:40.649 --> 01:19:41.615
then I shoot him.

1454
01:19:41.617 --> 01:19:43.383
You want me to confess?

1455
01:19:43.385 --> 01:19:45.252
Give me piece of paper.
I confess.


1456
01:19:45.254 --> 01:19:46.887
What about Rosalie?

1457
01:19:46.889 --> 01:19:48.922
Rosalie? She does nothing.

1458
01:19:48.924 --> 01:19:49.723
No, I do everything.

1459
01:19:49.725 --> 01:19:53.060
I give him pills,
I shoot him, everything.


1460
01:19:53.062 --> 01:19:56.196
And while you were doing this,
what was your daughter doing?


1461
01:19:56.198 --> 01:20:00.667
She was begging me to stop.

1462
01:20:00.669 --> 01:20:04.872
But I do it anyway,
and you know why?


1463
01:20:04.874 --> 01:20:08.942
I am her mother.
I do what I like.


1464
01:20:08.944 --> 01:20:11.879
I thought Devo shot him
the first time.


1465
01:20:11.881 --> 01:20:13.147
Devo?

1466
01:20:13.149 --> 01:20:15.716
Oh, no.
You must be joking.


1467
01:20:15.718 --> 01:20:16.917
No, Devo's very nice boy.

1468
01:20:16.919 --> 01:20:19.920
He wouldn't shoot nobody.

1469
01:20:19.922 --> 01:20:20.687
I don't understand

1470
01:20:20.689 --> 01:20:23.490
why you're trying
to blame it on Rosalie.


1471
01:20:23.492 --> 01:20:24.892
Maybe I did it.

1472
01:20:24.894 --> 01:20:26.693
Maybe I'm glad I did it.

1473
01:20:26.695 --> 01:20:28.328
Are you saying you did it?

1474
01:20:28.330 --> 01:20:29.930
No, he's not saying that.

1475
01:20:29.932 --> 01:20:31.165
What's he saying?

1476
01:20:31.167 --> 01:20:35.802
He's not saying anything.

1477
01:20:35.804 --> 01:20:37.304
I know how to fire a gun.

1478
01:20:37.306 --> 01:20:39.973
My brother was in
the National Guard.


1479
01:20:39.975 --> 01:20:40.741
So what are you saying?

1480
01:20:40.743 --> 01:20:48.743
He's saying that his brother
is a patriotic American.


1481
01:20:56.357 --> 01:20:58.859
Ms. Boca, was it
a crime of passion?


1482
01:20:58.861 --> 01:21:01.328
Look at all these people.

1483
01:21:01.330 --> 01:21:03.564
Rosalie, it's me, Tony.
What can you tell me?


1484
01:21:03.566 --> 01:21:05.766
Mama, remember, you had
nothing to do with it.


1485
01:21:05.768 --> 01:21:07.935
Tonight I bet you anything

1486
01:21:07.937 --> 01:21:10.370
we'll be on TV, you and me.

1487
01:21:10.372 --> 01:21:11.305
Can you imagine?

1488
01:21:11.307 --> 01:21:15.242
Rosalie, can you
give us a statement?


1489
01:21:18.479 --> 01:21:21.515
Devo. Devo, what
can you tell us?


1490
01:21:21.517 --> 01:21:22.216
What happened?

1491
01:21:22.218 --> 01:21:23.617
Is it true that
the Mafia involved?


1492
01:21:23.619 --> 01:21:25.185
I have nothing to say
at this time.


1493
01:21:25.187 --> 01:21:26.187
No comment.

1494
01:21:26.188 --> 01:21:28.121
What about you, sir?

1495
01:21:28.123 --> 01:21:29.456
Get the fuck away from me.

1496
01:21:29.458 --> 01:21:32.092
What about Joey?
Is he dead, or what?


1497
01:21:32.094 --> 01:21:34.428
Who's Joey?

1498
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:37.164
You know, the guy.
The guy.


1499
01:21:37.166 --> 01:21:39.233
Oh, yeah, the guy.

1500
01:21:39.235 --> 01:21:40.033
Fuck.

1501
01:21:40.035 --> 01:21:40.734
He's still alive.

1502
01:21:40.736 --> 01:21:42.703
Why? What do you
know about it?


1503
01:21:42.705 --> 01:21:46.506
Oh, nothing.

1504
01:21:58.019 --> 01:22:00.520
Rosalie...

1505
01:22:17.338 --> 01:22:18.405
Lacey.

1506
01:22:18.407 --> 01:22:19.740
How you doing?

1507
01:22:19.742 --> 01:22:22.542
Hi, Joey. How do you feel?

1508
01:22:26.614 --> 01:22:29.850
You should see all
the reporters outside.


1509
01:22:29.852 --> 01:22:32.586
You're going to be so famous.

1510
01:22:32.588 --> 01:22:34.321
I even heard <i>People</i> magazine

1511
01:22:34.323 --> 01:22:35.255
was going to interview you.

1512
01:22:35.257 --> 01:22:36.890
Lacey, you shouldn't
be here now.


1513
01:22:36.892 --> 01:22:37.424
It's not right.

1514
01:22:37.426 --> 01:22:41.662
But the doctor said you're
going to be out in a week.


1515
01:22:41.664 --> 01:22:46.233
Listen, baby...

1516
01:22:46.235 --> 01:22:49.936
when somebody
shoot you in the head...


1517
01:22:49.938 --> 01:22:51.171
it makes you think.

1518
01:22:51.173 --> 01:22:53.974
I've been doing
a lot of thinking lately,


1519
01:22:53.976 --> 01:22:57.077
a whole lot, and...

1520
01:22:57.079 --> 01:22:58.011
I can't mess around anymore.

1521
01:22:58.013 --> 01:22:59.479
I've got to be, you know,
a good husband.


1522
01:22:59.481 --> 01:23:01.615
From now on, I've got to take
my marriage


1523
01:23:01.617 --> 01:23:02.582
a little more serious.

1524
01:23:02.584 --> 01:23:03.684
You know what I mean?

1525
01:23:03.686 --> 01:23:06.119
Joey, what are you saying?

1526
01:23:06.121 --> 01:23:08.755
She shot you. Twice.

1527
01:23:08.757 --> 01:23:10.157
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1528
01:23:10.159 --> 01:23:13.860
She never shot me herself,
per se.


1529
01:23:13.862 --> 01:23:17.364
So what about us?

1530
01:23:17.366 --> 01:23:22.102
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.


1531
01:23:22.104 --> 01:23:26.073
That's all over now.

1532
01:23:26.075 --> 01:23:30.277
I always told you
I loved my wife.


1533
01:23:33.014 --> 01:23:35.882
Joey, who is this woman?

1534
01:23:37.752 --> 01:23:40.987
Mama, this is Lacey.

1535
01:23:40.989 --> 01:23:41.955
She's a friend of mine.

1536
01:23:41.957 --> 01:23:45.025
My Joey has to get his rest.

1537
01:23:45.027 --> 01:23:46.793
You shouldn't be here now.

1538
01:23:46.795 --> 01:23:47.828
I was just leaving.

1539
01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:49.730
Good. Just leave.

1540
01:23:49.732 --> 01:23:51.298
You don't belong here anyway.

1541
01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:53.633
You're not his wife.

1542
01:23:55.536 --> 01:23:59.072
I'll see you later, Joey.

1543
01:24:14.756 --> 01:24:17.624
How are you feeling today?

1544
01:24:17.626 --> 01:24:23.230
Okay, Mama, better.

1545
01:24:23.232 --> 01:24:26.266
I spoke to Rosalie this morning.

1546
01:24:26.268 --> 01:24:30.604
You did? What
did she tell you?


1547
01:24:30.606 --> 01:24:33.907
What did she tell me?

1548
01:24:33.909 --> 01:24:36.543
She told me the truth.

1549
01:24:36.545 --> 01:24:40.013
What's the matter
with you, you big shot?


1550
01:24:40.015 --> 01:24:41.248
Cheating on your wife.

1551
01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:42.182
Ai, Mama!

1552
01:24:42.184 --> 01:24:46.286
Please, I got
a bullet in my head.


1553
01:24:46.288 --> 01:24:48.388
You should have
two bullets in your head.


1554
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:49.790
Three bullets!
Four bullets!


1555
01:24:49.792 --> 01:24:53.160
Ai! Mama, please,
I'm so sorry.


1556
01:24:53.162 --> 01:24:54.795
What can I say?

1557
01:24:55.763 --> 01:25:00.767
You no tell <i>me</i> you're sorry.

1558
01:25:00.769 --> 01:25:02.169
No.
No.


1559
01:25:02.171 --> 01:25:05.705
You tell Rosalie.

1560
01:25:05.707 --> 01:25:07.674
Oh, <i>si,</i> good idea.
Sure, yeah.


1561
01:25:07.676 --> 01:25:12.245
Otherwise, I give you
such a beating...


1562
01:25:12.247 --> 01:25:14.147
Okay.

1563
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:19.553
Mama, that's a good idea.

1564
01:25:21.122 --> 01:25:23.457
Oh, no.

1565
01:25:23.459 --> 01:25:26.927
Mama...

1566
01:25:33.501 --> 01:25:35.302
Ai!

1567
01:25:45.546 --> 01:25:47.147
How can you bail her out?

1568
01:25:47.149 --> 01:25:48.582
Don't you see what that means?

1569
01:25:48.584 --> 01:25:51.785
It means she can come home.

1570
01:25:51.787 --> 01:25:52.953
In the hospital,

1571
01:25:52.955 --> 01:25:54.321
you said you'd prosecute.

1572
01:25:54.323 --> 01:25:57.491
I know, Larry.
I changed my mind.


1573
01:25:57.493 --> 01:25:58.124
I'm sorry.

1574
01:25:58.126 --> 01:26:01.761
I learned a lot
in the last few weeks.


1575
01:26:01.763 --> 01:26:04.264
You wouldn't have
revenge on your mind,


1576
01:26:04.266 --> 01:26:05.298
would you, Joey?

1577
01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:07.767
She's my wife.

1578
01:26:07.769 --> 01:26:10.637
I want to bring her home.

1579
01:26:10.639 --> 01:26:11.671
I love her.

1580
01:26:11.673 --> 01:26:12.673
You understand?

1581
01:26:12.674 --> 01:26:14.641
She shouldn't be in prison.

1582
01:26:14.643 --> 01:26:17.711
She's the mother of my children.

1583
01:26:18.212 --> 01:26:20.313
Maybe she had plenty
of good reasons


1584
01:26:20.315 --> 01:26:22.282
for trying to kill me.

1585
01:26:22.284 --> 01:26:23.783
You ever think of that?

1586
01:26:23.785 --> 01:26:26.653
Joe, suppose she tries again.

1587
01:26:26.655 --> 01:26:27.787
She could, you know.

1588
01:26:27.789 --> 01:26:31.591
Yeah, she could.

1589
01:26:31.593 --> 01:26:33.226
You know Rosalie.

1590
01:26:33.228 --> 01:26:41.201
When she's in love,
she's a complete maniac.


1591
01:26:48.309 --> 01:26:51.444
Don't get your dress wet
for Mommy.


1592
01:26:51.446 --> 01:26:54.648
I won't.

1593
01:27:12.833 --> 01:27:14.968
Hey, Devo!

1594
01:27:17.405 --> 01:27:18.638
Devo!

1595
01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:20.073
How are you?

1596
01:27:20.075 --> 01:27:23.310
Devo?

1597
01:27:31.719 --> 01:27:34.454
Wait, Marlon...

1598
01:27:34.456 --> 01:27:36.489
look who's here.

1599
01:27:36.491 --> 01:27:37.924
Hey, wow.

1600
01:27:37.926 --> 01:27:39.659
How you doing?

1601
01:27:39.661 --> 01:27:40.894
I'm okay.

1602
01:27:40.896 --> 01:27:43.597
Who is this?

1603
01:27:45.833 --> 01:27:47.734
This is Joey.

1604
01:27:47.736 --> 01:27:48.668
Joey?

1605
01:27:48.670 --> 01:27:51.471
You know, the guy.

1606
01:27:51.473 --> 01:27:54.074
The guy.

1607
01:27:54.076 --> 01:27:59.980
Oh. Wow. Joey.

1608
01:28:00.581 --> 01:28:02.115
You bailed us out.

1609
01:28:02.117 --> 01:28:04.084
Yeah, I bail out everybody.

1610
01:28:04.086 --> 01:28:06.019
I want to make a new start,

1611
01:28:06.021 --> 01:28:06.853
wipe the slate clean.

1612
01:28:06.855 --> 01:28:09.556
I hear they may charge us
with attempted murder.


1613
01:28:09.558 --> 01:28:12.425
No, no, no. I'm not
going to prosecute.


1614
01:28:12.427 --> 01:28:13.427
See, if I prosecute you,

1615
01:28:13.428 --> 01:28:16.029
they're going to put
Rosalie in jail too.


1616
01:28:16.031 --> 01:28:16.796
I don't want that.

1617
01:28:16.798 --> 01:28:19.032
No, without me,
they got no case.


1618
01:28:19.034 --> 01:28:19.866
Don't worry.

1619
01:28:19.868 --> 01:28:22.369
Hey, you know, what happened,

1620
01:28:22.371 --> 01:28:25.372
it wasn't personal or anything.

1621
01:28:25.374 --> 01:28:26.606
Yeah.

1622
01:28:26.608 --> 01:28:28.975
Right. I mean...

1623
01:28:28.977 --> 01:28:30.510
we didn't even know you
or anything.


1624
01:28:30.512 --> 01:28:33.546
Yeah, we weren't friends
or anything,


1625
01:28:33.548 --> 01:28:34.114
like now.

1626
01:28:34.116 --> 01:28:39.819
No. No. It wasn't
the best way to meet.


1627
01:28:39.821 --> 01:28:42.656
We'd better get out of here,

1628
01:28:42.658 --> 01:28:45.992
you know, before they
change their mind.


1629
01:28:45.994 --> 01:28:48.862
Yeah. Right.

1630
01:28:48.864 --> 01:28:51.297
So long, Joey.

1631
01:28:51.299 --> 01:28:53.199
I guess we'll see you around.

1632
01:28:53.201 --> 01:28:56.136
Okay.

1633
01:29:01.442 --> 01:29:03.576
Oh, what a nice guy.

1634
01:29:03.578 --> 01:29:04.544
Yeah.

1635
01:29:04.546 --> 01:29:07.013
Who's Rosalie?

1636
01:29:12.286 --> 01:29:16.690
Joey, I'm really, really sorry

1637
01:29:16.692 --> 01:29:18.658
about what happened.

1638
01:29:21.595 --> 01:29:24.964
You tried to tell me
a long time ago, Devo.


1639
01:29:24.966 --> 01:29:27.434
I should have listened to you.

1640
01:29:27.436 --> 01:29:29.135
I wasn't treating Rosalie right.

1641
01:29:29.137 --> 01:29:30.870
Rosalie is a wonderful lady.

1642
01:29:30.872 --> 01:29:34.574
I know. I'm going to
make it up to her.


1643
01:29:34.576 --> 01:29:35.241
Good.

1644
01:29:35.243 --> 01:29:37.343
Thanks for bailing me out.

1645
01:29:37.345 --> 01:29:38.011
Sure, sure.

1646
01:29:38.013 --> 01:29:40.480
Just no more shooting me
in the head, okay?


1647
01:29:40.482 --> 01:29:43.950
Why not? It seems
to have helped.


1648
01:29:43.952 --> 01:29:45.752
It's the truth.

1649
01:29:45.754 --> 01:29:51.124
I got a bullet in my head,
I never felt better.


1650
01:29:57.799 --> 01:29:59.866
Hi, Mom.

1651
01:30:00.201 --> 01:30:02.168
Oh, my babies!

1652
01:30:02.170 --> 01:30:06.239
Oh, Dominic, Dominic.

1653
01:30:06.241 --> 01:30:10.777
Don't worry, we're safe.

1654
01:30:10.779 --> 01:30:13.012
Don't worry.

1655
01:30:18.953 --> 01:30:19.953
So, what do you want?

1656
01:30:19.955 --> 01:30:25.825
I'm sorry I treat
your daughter so bad.


1657
01:30:25.827 --> 01:30:28.495
I broke my marriage vows...

1658
01:30:28.497 --> 01:30:31.865
but I don't break nothing
ever again, I swear.


1659
01:30:31.867 --> 01:30:35.869
And this is for me, this candy?

1660
01:30:35.871 --> 01:30:37.670
Well, I...

1661
01:30:37.672 --> 01:30:39.272
Yeah, thank you.

1662
01:30:39.274 --> 01:30:40.039
You're very good boy.

1663
01:30:40.041 --> 01:30:43.910
Yeah, you know,
I liked you once.


1664
01:30:43.912 --> 01:30:46.913
Maybe I like you again...

1665
01:30:46.915 --> 01:30:50.350
except chocolate
is not my favorite.


1666
01:30:50.352 --> 01:30:52.452
I like hard candy.

1667
01:30:52.454 --> 01:30:53.286
Well, I'll remember...

1668
01:30:53.288 --> 01:30:57.190
No, no, no, no.
I keep this for now.


1669
01:30:57.391 --> 01:30:59.759
Great. I can't
wait to get home.


1670
01:30:59.761 --> 01:31:01.661
Dominic. Dominic, come.

1671
01:31:01.663 --> 01:31:02.762
You come with me.

1672
01:31:02.764 --> 01:31:07.167
Come with me, I give you
some of my candy.


1673
01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:12.539
We go find Devo.
Come.


1674
01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:27.120
What's this?

1675
01:31:27.122 --> 01:31:29.856
What are you
giving me flowers for?


1676
01:31:34.328 --> 01:31:36.529
I want you to marry me again.

1677
01:31:36.531 --> 01:31:37.230
What?

1678
01:31:37.232 --> 01:31:40.800
A new marriage, new life.

1679
01:31:40.802 --> 01:31:44.704
We have big ceremony.

1680
01:31:47.374 --> 01:31:49.342
You think I'm going to
make the same mistake?


1681
01:31:49.344 --> 01:31:50.777
We're not even divorced yet.

1682
01:31:50.779 --> 01:31:53.012
How can you marry me again?

1683
01:31:53.014 --> 01:31:55.048
Rosie! Rosie!

1684
01:31:57.484 --> 01:31:59.919
Come here, please.

1685
01:31:59.921 --> 01:32:03.590
I love you.
I bailed you out.


1686
01:32:03.592 --> 01:32:06.159
Don't do this to me again, Joey.

1687
01:32:06.161 --> 01:32:07.961
I tried to kill you.

1688
01:32:07.963 --> 01:32:10.930
No.
You saved my life.


1689
01:32:10.932 --> 01:32:11.631
What?

1690
01:32:11.633 --> 01:32:13.633
Those sleeping pills
you gave me,


1691
01:32:13.635 --> 01:32:15.735
they slowed down my bleeding.

1692
01:32:15.737 --> 01:32:16.803
It's what kept me alive.

1693
01:32:16.805 --> 01:32:18.137
The doctor told me.

1694
01:32:18.139 --> 01:32:18.872
Son of bitch,

1695
01:32:18.874 --> 01:32:21.040
you cheated on me
all these years.


1696
01:32:21.042 --> 01:32:21.941
Why should I trust you now?

1697
01:32:21.943 --> 01:32:24.711
Because I'm changed.
I'm a new man.


1698
01:32:24.713 --> 01:32:26.946
Why? Why now
all of a sudden?


1699
01:32:26.948 --> 01:32:29.382
Because you shot me.

1700
01:32:29.384 --> 01:32:31.117
What?

1701
01:32:31.119 --> 01:32:34.587
Oh, Rosie, when I woke up
in that hospital


1702
01:32:34.589 --> 01:32:37.257
and I found out what happened,

1703
01:32:37.259 --> 01:32:38.024
I said to myself,

1704
01:32:38.026 --> 01:32:41.694
"My God, this woman,
she loves me to death."


1705
01:32:41.696 --> 01:32:46.132
She loves me so much
she'd rather kill me


1706
01:32:46.134 --> 01:32:48.468
than see me with another woman.

1707
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:50.603
She's ready to go
to prison for me,


1708
01:32:50.605 --> 01:32:52.505
she loves me so much.

1709
01:32:52.507 --> 01:32:53.806
Oh, baby.

1710
01:32:53.808 --> 01:32:57.176
That's all I needed,
just to feel your passion,


1711
01:32:57.178 --> 01:33:01.147
to know you still love me
like a man...


1712
01:33:01.149 --> 01:33:07.287
not like a husband, like a man.

1713
01:33:07.588 --> 01:33:08.821
You <i>are</i> my husband.

1714
01:33:08.823 --> 01:33:09.722
You should be proud of it.

1715
01:33:09.724 --> 01:33:13.126
I'm your wife.
I was always proud of it.


1716
01:33:13.128 --> 01:33:14.594
Okay, you're right.

1717
01:33:14.596 --> 01:33:16.496
I am your husband.

1718
01:33:16.498 --> 01:33:17.530
I'll be proud too.

1719
01:33:17.532 --> 01:33:21.100
I'll never cheat on you
again. Never.


1720
01:33:21.102 --> 01:33:23.670
Oh, Rosie, I love you.

1721
01:33:23.672 --> 01:33:24.737
Be my wife again.

1722
01:33:24.739 --> 01:33:26.673
Oh, you're crazy.

1723
01:33:26.675 --> 01:33:28.241
Don't you see?

1724
01:33:28.243 --> 01:33:29.342
It's our destiny.

1725
01:33:29.344 --> 01:33:31.110
We're doomed to be together.

1726
01:33:31.112 --> 01:33:32.045
Like Romeo and Juliet.

1727
01:33:32.047 --> 01:33:34.981
And I'll always
be faithful to you.


1728
01:33:34.983 --> 01:33:36.416
Like Romeo and Juliet.

1729
01:33:36.418 --> 01:33:38.885
Whatever.

1730
01:33:50.464 --> 01:33:53.132
You think Joey can be
faithful to her?


1731
01:33:53.134 --> 01:33:54.734
Anything is possible.

1732
01:33:54.736 --> 01:33:56.836
He gave me a box of candy.

1733
01:33:58.773 --> 01:34:01.140
What if he isn't?

1734
01:34:01.142 --> 01:34:03.743
We shoot him again.

1735
01:34:05.946 --> 01:34:09.782
Just kidding.
