00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:53.340
It was a pleasure
meeting you, trevor.


319
00:14:53.451 --> 00:14:54.383
Yeah.

320
00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:56.552
Ouch.

321
00:14:59.157 --> 00:15:00.681
Kendyl, can I talk
to you for a second?


322
00:15:00.791 --> 00:15:03.582
-Sure.
-What the hell was that?


323
00:15:03.602 --> 00:15:05.676
I'd watch my tone if I were you.

324
00:15:05.696 --> 00:15:07.996
You're still in your
probationary period.


325
00:15:08.016 --> 00:15:10.924
That was what a successful
premier episode looks like.


326
00:15:10.985 --> 00:15:12.401
You set me up.

327
00:15:12.511 --> 00:15:15.271
I wasn't planning on
talking about any of that.

Oh! [chuckles]

It's cute that you think
you have a say in the matter

You can't do that.

00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:28.941
Monica, I can do
anything that I want.

you get yourself a cup

have caused you pain.

she's making me tell my story.

something I can do about it.

it a little too well.

than you even know.

believe that, but I don't.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

to go lay her ass down,

00:31:24.732 --> 00:31:28.509
And...I'm not ready
to air it out yet.

Maybe ever.

642
00:31:29.813 --> 00:31:34.316
Shedding light on challenging
topics starts conversations.


643

Conversations that
need to be had.


644

ratings from our premiere,

Well, kendyl, you know, I
just still think that maybe--


649
00:31:53.761 --> 00:31:55.695
[kendyl] you're
not paid to think.

Mm-hmm. Yeah, no, that's

Hey! Are you, um, kelly?

Yeah.

00:33:11.197 --> 00:33:13.264
Ah, cute dog!

662
00:33:13.299 --> 00:33:15.849
Can I hold him?
What's his name?


663
00:33:15.869 --> 00:33:17.550
Her name? Shy.

664
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:18.601
Hi, shy!

665
00:33:18.621 --> 00:33:21.907
So she's a little
bitch like you.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:23.240
Excuse me?

667

Yeah, see,
I'm layla's new roommate.


668
00:33:24.794 --> 00:33:26.569
And she told me
how you stiffed her


669
00:33:26.596 --> 00:33:29.331
On two months' rent,
yes she did.


670
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:31.416
Look, that's none
of your business.


671
00:33:31.526 --> 00:33:32.751
Yeah, well,
unfortunately for you,


672
00:33:32.786 --> 00:33:36.104
I'm making it my business.
Yes, I am!

Ah, ah!

674
00:33:39.225 --> 00:33:40.206
Give me my dog.

675
00:33:40.226 --> 00:33:42.283
Oh, so you want your dog back?

676
00:33:42.303 --> 00:33:45.280
Kind of how like layla
wants your money back.


677
00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:48.767
Yeah, and I'm gonna need
you to give it to me today.

Mm!

Ah!

You're afraid
I'm gonna hurt shy?

I would never hurt a dog.

Can't say the same
about you, though.

I'm gonna need that money today.

And the waves.
Long waves.

-Mm-hmm.

And I think it's making
me a little crazy. Yup.


696
00:34:42.872 --> 00:34:46.825
Mm, but there's a method
to her madness at work.


697
00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:49.100
Madness is exactly right.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.030
But, like,
in that bedroom, like...


699

She let her freak flag fly.

[monica] wait, what?

701
00:34:59.856 --> 00:35:02.507
Bebe, you slept with kendyl?

702
00:35:02.617 --> 00:35:06.544
It was the eighth thing on
my list and she was there.

She's gay.

About corporate dos and don'ts,

706
00:35:15.205 --> 00:35:18.356
Yeah, I never thought that I
would have to state the obvious,


707
00:35:18.466 --> 00:35:23.302
Which is do not
shag the boss.

What happened to
a better bebe, hm?

The night I was with kendyl,
I was a damn good bebe,

If I say so myself.

Thanks, but I didn't
tell you all of that


739

To make that your
responsibility to handle.

Is that your mom?

taught me to do makeup?

It's the one thing
that always got me through.


748
00:37:15.175 --> 00:37:16.724
She died of cancer.

749

We were each other's everything.

750
00:37:20.938 --> 00:37:23.181
And when she passed,

751
00:37:23.333 --> 00:37:26.683
I went from
one group home to the next.


752
00:37:26.703 --> 00:37:30.021
Got in some trouble, but...

Um, so, how's work?

I think I offended
the new host, monica.

How?

758
00:37:48.725 --> 00:37:51.359
I basically called
her a hypocrite


759
00:37:51.469 --> 00:37:53.376
For not standing by her sister.

760

I mean, according to monica,
the lady's done some bad things,

But there's always
two sides to a story.

do this.

monica as a peace offering.

how that would work.

us, like, start over."

she will love it.

Which they believe will
help them move on from

Their own trauma.

1147

Look, I know this
was hard for you,

But think of it like this.

become a mother.

Well, they'll see how brave
and inspirational you were


1154

Telling your story, and...

1155
00:57:29.872 --> 00:57:32.814
They will be very
proud of their mother.

Thank you, kendyl.

1157
00:57:36.995 --> 00:57:38.226
So let's get started on

That black maternal
health story of yours.

But I thought you didn't--

You said spotlighting it was
a particular passion of yours.

Right?

1162

Yes, absolutely.

1163

Well, let's make it happen.

1164

You're gonna have
to go without me.

Kendyl greenlit my maternal
health story, so...


1171
00:58:12.856 --> 00:58:13.929
Okay!

1172
00:58:13.949 --> 00:58:16.082
Yeah, so, I'm gonna
get this outline to her

Before she can change her mind.
