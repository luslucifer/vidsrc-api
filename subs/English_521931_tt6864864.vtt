00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:13.805
BOBBY: How's my hair? Alright, Gerry?
- GEBBY: Yep.


2
00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:16.394
Hope you get the flowers in the garden,
get a bit of colour


3
00:00:16.431 --> 00:00:18.024
just to show them the paradise
I'm living in.


4
00:00:18.058 --> 00:00:21.232
Get the trees in, the grass,
the p/so/na, that's the swimming pool,


5
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.944
the /ard/n is the garden,
f/ores is the flowers...


6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.442
GEBBY: I'rn recording.
- BOBBY: Come on, Gerry, let's go.


7
00:00:58.181 --> 00:01:02.061
BOBBY: From my ear/y days
/ always knew what/ wanted to do.


8
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.147
/t was in my blood.

9
00:01:07.691 --> 00:01:10.695
And it ain't gonna come easy, is it?
Ain't just gonna come out of the sky.


10
00:01:11.903 --> 00:01:13.780
You gotta make things happen.

11
00:01:16.199 --> 00:01:17.792
/ never knew where it would lead me.

12
00:01:19.786 --> 00:01:23.086
It just says here, 'Wishing you
the best of luck against Paraguay.'


13
00:01:23.123 --> 00:01:26.002
Burt Humphries, chimney sweep.
He's from Birmingham.


14
00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:35.140
Where do / begin to tel/ the story
of a greater /ove than this?


15
00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:39.390
AUDIENCE CHEERS

16
00:01:52.527 --> 00:01:53.949
/ remember everything.

17
00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:57.332
How long have you got?

18
00:02:16.843 --> 00:02:20.188
/ came home when
/ was work/ng in Porta/ga/.

19
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:25.815
My wife said, '/'ve arranged for you
to see the doctor about your sinuses. '


20
00:02:28.438 --> 00:02:31.032
The surgeon said,
'/'ve got some very grave news for you.


21
00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:36.872
You have a malignant melanoma
in your nose inside your head.


22
00:02:38.532 --> 00:02:40.705
You need an operation yesterday. '

23
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.502
They out me from
the corner of my eye

24
00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:55.717
around the contour of my nostri/
and through my /ip


25
00:02:56.758 --> 00:02:58.305
which they completely severed.

26
00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:03.436
Then they pinned the f/ap of my face
almost to my ear


27
00:03:04.641 --> 00:03:05.984
took my teeth out

28
00:03:07.102 --> 00:03:08.979
and went through the roof of my mouth.

29
00:03:17.487 --> 00:03:20.536
HUW: Patients always want to know,
'How long have / got, Doc?'


30
00:03:21.074 --> 00:03:22.417
But you can 'Z' predict.

31
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.881
For his diagnosis the vast majority
of the patients do not survive.


32
00:03:29.458 --> 00:03:31.131
Two to three years would be good.

33
00:03:34.254 --> 00:03:36.427
BOBBY:
What we suggest you do is you ret/re.


34
00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:39.806
People with this don't go back to work.

35
00:03:44.806 --> 00:03:48.436
Well, they didn't know Bob
the way I knew him.


36
00:04:00.864 --> 00:04:02.741
REPOHTEHS SPEAK SPANISH

37
00:04:05.035 --> 00:04:07.788
Muy different! Muches!

38
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.670
ELSIE:
/t was his dream to go to manage Barcelona.


39
00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.883
We've come here to work hard,
we've come here to produce a winning team


40
00:04:18.924 --> 00:04:21.848
to get results
and to play effective football.


41
00:04:29.267 --> 00:04:31.565
HE SPEAKS SPANISH

42
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.907
BOBBY:
I/Ve//, / had been to Barcelona before


43
00:04:42.948 --> 00:04:44.621
because we had played against them.

44
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.707
So / knew the magnificence of the c/ub,
the expectations.


45
00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:58.389
JOSE: /t was spot on when they chose
Mr Hobson to be the next one, spot on.


46
00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.888
Barcelona was a really difficult moment

47
00:05:05.929 --> 00:05:10.560
because it was the moment of the conflict
between the club and Johan Cruyff.


48
00:05:11.768 --> 00:05:13.736
I follow a legend.

49
00:05:15.021 --> 00:05:16.193
A legend!

50
00:05:19.025 --> 00:05:24.953
Johan Cruyff was the most
influential person in Barcelona


51
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.039
in terms of the way we want to play,
the way we want to be.


52
00:05:28.702 --> 00:05:30.830
PEP:
/t was a tough, tough task.


53
00:05:32.247 --> 00:05:34.625
BOBBY:
/ went into a political storm.


54
00:05:37.085 --> 00:05:39.929
The city was sp/it,
ha/f of them d/dh't want him


55
00:05:39.963 --> 00:05:43.342
because he had been there eight years
and the /ast two years they'd won nothing


56
00:05:43.383 --> 00:05:45.761
and the other he/f absolutely adored him.

57
00:05:47.512 --> 00:05:49.480
How do you follow Johan Cruyff?

58
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.320
JOAN: The president of the club
was Josep L/we NU/792.


59
00:05:56.646 --> 00:05:59.741
He had been president for 18 years.

60
00:06:15.206 --> 00:06:18.085
JOAN:
There were supposed to be elections in 1998.


61
00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.554
The board of directors sacked Cruyff

62
00:06:21.588 --> 00:06:23.386
and they needed to win titles.

63
00:06:24.424 --> 00:06:28.930
/z"s //ke any player of the world
coming after Messi.


64
00:06:30.847 --> 00:06:33.225
I am not afraid to follow him.

65
00:06:34.351 --> 00:06:36.604
When the President
of the United States leaves


66
00:06:36.645 --> 00:06:39.649
they have to get another
President of the United States.


67
00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:44.448
H UW:
He was just inc/'ed/b/e.


68
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.915
He takes over the most d/fHcu/t job
in the world, Barcelona.


69
00:06:50.825 --> 00:06:53.874
/ was thrilled for him, ob vious/y,
because he wanted to do it


70
00:06:53.912 --> 00:06:56.290
but we didn't know
how long he was go/ng to survive.


71
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.798
BOBBY:
/t didn't worry me. / was/7't afraid of it.


72
00:07:02.462 --> 00:07:04.556
I've had a long /ife,
and so / am experienced


73
00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:06.387
and / fe/t that /
could handle it, you know?

74
00:07:18.937 --> 00:07:21.406
STATIC CRACKLES

75
00:07:24.859 --> 00:07:30.662
Eastern sport begins this week at the scene
of today's big story at Portman Road


76
00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:32.997
the home of Ipswich Town Football Club.

77
00:07:33.034 --> 00:07:37.505
This is a club of which former manager
Jackie Milburn said this weekend


78
00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:40.759
'It's only got one way to go,
and that's down.'


79
00:07:40.792 --> 00:07:44.046
This is the club that Bobby Robson
today took over.


80
00:07:44.087 --> 00:07:45.680
Bobby, why?

81
00:07:47.132 --> 00:07:50.352
Well, of course you've given me a lovely
controversial question to begin with.


82
00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:55.145
I've come here because I'rn sure that
there's a great job to do here in football.


83
00:07:55.849 --> 00:08:00.025
Many people have given impressions
about the state of the club here.


84
00:08:00.061 --> 00:08:02.109
I personally wouldn't say that they're true.

85
00:08:02.147 --> 00:08:04.650
This is a club which will allow me
to manage


86
00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:06.864
and are prepared
to give me a chance.


87
00:08:06.901 --> 00:08:08.869
Bobby Robson, we wish you good luck
as you start.


88
00:08:08.903 --> 00:08:10.120
Thank you very much indeed.

89
00:08:13.324 --> 00:08:15.201
BOBBY: Good morning.
It's Ipswich Football Club here.


90
00:08:15.243 --> 00:08:16.586
It's Mr Robson.

91
00:08:18.163 --> 00:08:21.337
BOBBY: /mean / didn't have any rea/
cred/b///ty as a manager.


92
00:08:23.043 --> 00:08:24.590
That's bloody stupid.

93
00:08:25.462 --> 00:08:27.305
No rea/ experience.

94
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.019
/ was a young greenhorn.

95
00:08:34.637 --> 00:08:37.015
They were tak/ng a chance on me.

96
00:08:38.224 --> 00:08:41.148
I'd like to bring the players
for a light snack, you know


97
00:08:41.186 --> 00:08:42.859
before Norwich City today.

98
00:08:42.896 --> 00:08:44.739
Well, all we want really, it's very simple

99
00:08:44.773 --> 00:08:47.652
all we eat is
tea and toast and jam.

100
00:08:49.652 --> 00:08:54.032
When you take over /t's because something
has fa//ed to happen at the club.


101
00:08:55.116 --> 00:08:57.585
Now, they play off two strikers.

102
00:08:57.619 --> 00:09:02.125
That's their four, and that's their four,
the crosses are their four.


103
00:09:02.499 --> 00:09:04.251
I'rn having a bad morning here.

104
00:09:04.292 --> 00:09:06.340
Alright then, with an alternate jump then.

105
00:09:06.419 --> 00:09:09.923
We're simply gonna go out and a rebound,
and out and a rebound


106
00:09:09.964 --> 00:09:11.307
Let's do... let's do a dozen.

107
00:09:11.341 --> 00:09:13.389
Stretch it again.

108
00:09:13.426 --> 00:09:15.269
TERRY: When he first got the job
a /ot of people were say/ng


109
00:09:15.303 --> 00:09:18.477
'We//, who is this guy
and /ook at his track record. '


110
00:09:19.265 --> 00:09:20.187
Alright, fine, that'll do.

111
00:09:21.267 --> 00:09:25.693
But Bobby Robson was well ahead
of his time in every football oapaoity


112
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:26.947
every football area.

113
00:09:26.981 --> 00:09:28.608
He was miles ahead of his time.

114
00:09:28.983 --> 00:09:30.826
We'll do a scene set here.

115
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.328
BOBBY:
/ ran the club.


116
00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:34.531
And al/ the concepts, al/ the departments

117
00:09:34.572 --> 00:09:37.701
l had a hand in and a say in
at /paw/'ch Town Football Club.


118
00:09:39.744 --> 00:09:44.591
AUDIENCE CHEEFIS AND CLAPS:
Ipswich! Ipswich! Ipswich!


119
00:09:46.209 --> 00:09:47.677
There was no money.

120
00:09:50.922 --> 00:09:54.927
What's the play? What's the play?
Bloody hell.


121
00:09:54.968 --> 00:09:57.141
/ knew that the policy
and the strength of the club


122
00:09:57.178 --> 00:10:01.308
would be in the youth system,
so we worked on that very hard.


123
00:10:01.349 --> 00:10:04.319
If there-'s half of the strikers on you,
accept it as such and knock it in.


124
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.739
Confidence and composure,
just a touch of Jimmy Greaves.


125
00:10:07.772 --> 00:10:09.570
He was certainly a man of his time.

126
00:10:09.607 --> 00:10:12.736
L\/lost managers will develop the first team

127
00:10:13.444 --> 00:10:15.196
because it keeps them in a job

128
00:10:15.238 --> 00:10:17.912
and it must have given him
an enormous satisfaction


129
00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:21.419
to see these young players develop
into international players.


130
00:10:21.452 --> 00:10:24.331
Let's have no regrets, no regrets
at the end of the match.


131
00:10:25.123 --> 00:10:27.000
Now's the time. Do it now.

132
00:10:27.041 --> 00:10:29.419
ALEX:
/t was a fantastic piece of management.


133
00:10:35.884 --> 00:10:37.852
BOBBY:
/ had a very good team in '75


134
00:10:38.511 --> 00:10:41.264
and then we got to
the cup final in '78,

135
00:10:43.641 --> 00:10:47.111
COMMENTATOR:
Here they come into the sunshine.


136
00:10:48.813 --> 00:10:52.613
/t's the moment this 700,000 crowd
has waited for.


137
00:10:54.277 --> 00:10:56.951
BOBBY:
Everybody in the who/e area was enraptured.


138
00:10:57.947 --> 00:11:01.247
/ps wich Town /'n the final of the FA Cup,
they 're playing Arsenal.


139
00:11:02.493 --> 00:11:04.245
And nobody gave us a chance.

140
00:11:05.788 --> 00:11:08.166
COMMENTATOR:
Now for Wark. Driven in there!


141
00:11:12.045 --> 00:11:14.764
Oh, he's gone past Nelson,
across the face of the goal.


142
00:11:14.797 --> 00:11:17.220
That's got to be
it and it is it.

143
00:11:21.763 --> 00:11:24.733
And /pswich have won
for the first time in their history.


144
00:11:24.807 --> 00:11:28.277
And Bobby Robson,
a sm//e /ight/ng up his face.


145
00:11:34.359 --> 00:11:38.330
Bob, how does it feel to have done it
after waiting for a long time?


146
00:11:38.363 --> 00:11:40.866
Well, it's the best feeling I think
in all the world.


147
00:11:40.907 --> 00:11:42.409
CAF! HORN HONKS

148
00:11:43.409 --> 00:11:47.585
BOBBY: Having won it,
we took it around the county.


149
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.509
/z' always had to have

and we didn't Hnish t/// ha/f past ten.


151
00:11:56.923 --> 00:11:59.096
And the two po//cemen came back with me

152
00:11:59.133 --> 00:12:01.761
and / slept with the FA Cup
under my bed.


153
00:12:01.803 --> 00:12:03.430
MAN:
Well done, Bobby!


154
00:12:03.471 --> 00:12:04.313
/ can prom/se you that.

00:12:04.347 --> 00:12:06.315
Oh, no, no, no.

B O B BY:
Football is entertainment.


158
00:12:25.535 --> 00:12:29.881
What we hope to br/ng to Baroe/ona
is good football.


159
00:12:31.582 --> 00:12:35.962
And to do that we do need players
who can change the game.


160
00:12:38.256 --> 00:12:41.305
The Pres/dent said to me,
'We need bums on seats, Bobby.


161
00:12:41.301 --> 00:12:43.520
We need e top-c/ess striker,
do you know where there is one?'


162
00:12:43.553 --> 00:12:45.180
/ said yes.

163
00:12:45.847 --> 00:12:48.942
/ know there 's a young kid in PSV

164
00:12:49.684 --> 00:12:53.029
/ think he's terrific, but he's a risk.

165
00:12:59.569 --> 00:13:05.747
This was the real Ronaldo,

166
00:13:06.659 --> 00:13:07.785
'// fenomeno. '

167
00:13:07.827 --> 00:13:12.128
Ronaldo Nazario,
the best Ronaldo ever.


168
00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:17.591
I never saw the same.
I never saw the same.


169
00:13:21.257 --> 00:13:25.387
My manager calls me
and tells me that Bobby Robson


170
00:13:25.428 --> 00:13:27.772
is crazy to have me in Barcelona.

171
00:13:28.139 --> 00:13:31.734
And I say, 'Oh, my God,
this is a big challengef


172
00:13:37.106 --> 00:13:40.451
FRANK: Bobby said, 'Frank, /have
to be sure he can de//ver. '


173
00:13:41.235 --> 00:13:45.911
This is the most expensive player ever
in a big club as Barcelona.


174
00:13:45.948 --> 00:13:47.165
I cannot go wrong here.

175
00:13:49.285 --> 00:13:51.083
BOBBY:
We #na//y got him at 20 m////on.


176
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.963
The chairman of Barcelona
kept say/ng to me


177
00:13:52.997 --> 00:13:56.422
'Boob y, you know your job depends
on this transfer. '


178
00:14:01.881 --> 00:14:06.307
JOAN: S/r Babb;/'s official start in Barcelona
was the Super Cup against At/etico Madrid.


179
00:14:06.886 --> 00:14:09.435
/Z' was also Fiona/do 's first match.

180
00:14:10.139 --> 00:14:11.641
ANNOUNCER:

ANNOUNCER SPEAKS SPANISH

182
00:14:14.435 --> 00:14:17.939
RONALDO:
There was a very big expectation.


183
00:14:18.689 --> 00:14:25.038
L\/Ir Bobby Robson,
he make me feel so calm, so relaxed.


184
00:14:25.071 --> 00:14:30.749
He told me, 'Enjoy yourself,
have fun and bring the cup!'


185
00:14:37.959 --> 00:14:42.214
He was fast, intelligent.
He could do absolutely everything.


186
00:14:48.302 --> 00:14:50.100
JOAN:
Barcelona won 5-2.


187
00:14:54.767 --> 00:14:57.316
/t was a br////ant start
for Sir Bobby in Barcelona.


188
00:14:59.814 --> 00:15:01.487
Ronaldo is special.

189
00:15:02.108 --> 00:15:04.861
He has the physique of a
middleweight boxer.


190
00:15:04.861 --> 00:15:09.332
You know, good shoulders, good biceps,
good body, fantastic legs.


191
00:15:09.365 --> 00:15:13.336
And he is one of the quickest players
I've ever seen with the ball.


192
00:15:15.705 --> 00:15:19.175
FRANK: / never forget the goa/ he scored
against Compostela.


193
00:15:19.333 --> 00:15:20.459
It was unbelievable!

194
00:15:27.467 --> 00:15:30.220
RONALDO:
The goa/ /tse/f was amazing.


195
00:15:34.265 --> 00:15:40.898
But everyone who watched that goal
is surprised about Bobby Robson's reaction.


196
00:15:45.109 --> 00:15:47.988
'Oh, my God. Unbelievable what he did.'

197
00:15:48.529 --> 00:15:50.031
You know, the hands on the head.

198
00:15:50.072 --> 00:15:52.370
'This is unbelievable, this is not real.'

199
00:15:55.578 --> 00:15:58.127
PEP: He was running, running,
/ said, 'Pass the ba//. '


200
00:15:58.164 --> 00:15:59.211
He don't pass the ball.

201
00:16:00.333 --> 00:16:02.335
'Pass the ba//. ' 
He don't pass the ba//.

202
00:16:02.376 --> 00:16:05.300
And after score a goal, I said,
'Well done, don't pass the ball.'


203
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.598
So that is perfect.

204
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:13.145
RONALDO: That goal is
one of the best memories / have.


205
00:16:14.972 --> 00:16:18.101
Bobby's reaction for sure
is part of the goal.


206
00:16:38.704 --> 00:16:43.335
Bobby Robson, from the first day,
we had a meeting in one hotel


207
00:16:43.376 --> 00:16:48.257
and he came with a very young person
who was his assistant.


208
00:16:48.297 --> 00:16:50.220
Mr I\/Iourinho.

209
00:16:51.968 --> 00:16:57.520
We said, 'No, it's better that your assistant
would be someone from Barcelona, no?'


210
00:16:57.557 --> 00:17:00.857
No, no, no, no, no.
He insists, he insists, he insists.


211
00:17:00.893 --> 00:17:03.112
Please, please,
'If it's a question of money


212
00:17:03.145 --> 00:17:07.241
part of the money that you give to me
you can give to hirn.'


213
00:17:07.984 --> 00:17:09.861
Well, this is Bobby Robson, eh?

214
00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.535
JOAN: When he comes to Barcelona,
Mourinho was Hobson 's right hand.


215
00:17:17.159 --> 00:17:19.503
JOSE:
it was a bit difficu/z' in the beginning.


216
00:17:19.537 --> 00:17:22.006
Mr Hobson cou/dn 't speak any Span/sh.

217
00:17:22.039 --> 00:17:23.632
The penalty...

218
00:17:26.877 --> 00:17:29.300
/ had to obviously he/p.

219
00:17:29.338 --> 00:17:32.182

Don't get in too early!
Now you can go.


243
00:19:16.153 --> 00:19:19.282
ALEX: What / always remember of Bobby
was how he was giving of his time.


244
00:19:20.157 --> 00:19:22.535
I think he enjoyed helping
young managers.


245
00:19:23.577 --> 00:19:25.250
/ loved going in to see hirn.

246
00:19:25.955 --> 00:19:30.461
His approach to peep/e was different
from managers of my time.


247
00:19:30.501 --> 00:19:32.424
That's the ball, Eric. 
Go on, punch it!

248

Set it up for him, good!

before we played them
in the UEFA Cup game


251
00:19:40.094 --> 00:19:42.142
and he invited me to a training session

252
00:19:42.179 --> 00:19:46.229
and I am saying to myself,
'Wait a minute, what is he up to?'


253
00:19:46.851 --> 00:19:48.103
But that was Bobby Robson.

254
00:19:48.144 --> 00:19:50.567
He would have done it for
any young manager.


255
00:19:50.604 --> 00:19:53.278
And I took a lot out
of what he did that day.

You know, and have the best face

262
00:20:13.461 --> 00:20:15.304
because everyone is /ook/ng at me

Who motivates the motivator?

264
00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.021
ELSIE: Those years were
a great st/mu/ation for him


265
00:20:23.053 --> 00:20:27.229
to get the maximum
out of each of his players.


266
00:20:27.266 --> 00:20:31.487
So there was a tenderness there,
but there was also that drive.

I\/lillsy! l\/Iillsy!

Hey, tell Millsy and Warky, man!
And that silly twat!

Come on, let's play football!

270
00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:44.033
I want to voice my opinion
on performances.


271
00:20:44.074 --> 00:20:47.453
Negative, bad play, that's a crap play!
Is that what you get paid for?


272
00:20:47.495 --> 00:20:49.668
To wear a fuckin'
shirt and tie out there?

273
00:20:50.623 --> 00:20:52.375
TERRY:
He was tough.


274
00:20:52.416 --> 00:20:55.420
And I hated that play at the end, Butch,
I'll say it again, hate it.


275
00:20:55.461 --> 00:20:57.680
He wanted you to be the best
that you could be.


276
00:20:58.923 --> 00:21:01.551
/f that meant just dangling something
there for you to work on


277
00:21:01.592 --> 00:21:02.969
z'hat's what he did.

278
00:21:04.386 --> 00:21:06.514
We've won a match
and we were very lucky to win it.


279
00:21:07.097 --> 00:21:08.144
Scrapped.

280
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.437
He just had this aura about him.

281
00:21:18.859 --> 00:21:22.534
The first ten minutes is very important.
Go on bite, bite!


282
00:21:24.782 --> 00:21:26.625
That passion came across to us.

283
00:21:26.659 --> 00:21:28.536
Come on, tighter, McCall! Tighter!

284

And we made it
our pass/on as we//.


285
00:21:38.879 --> 00:21:42.179
The way that we played football,
he was building a fantastic reputation.

Not only in England,

All season rests on this one, all season!

INDISTINCT CHATTEH

299
00:22:50.701 --> 00:22:55.047
JOAN: /Z' was Barcelona 's best start
in the league for 33 years.


300
00:22:56.916 --> 00:23:01.638
CHEMI: But the fans were not enjoying
the football we played at that time.


301
00:23:03.297 --> 00:23:06.892
/ remember we won one game

302
00:23:06.926 --> 00:23:09.805
and the people, the fans whistled,
the people were not happy.


303
00:23:09.845 --> 00:23:12.268
And he arrived in the locker room

304
00:23:12.306 --> 00:23:15.401
and said 'The people is not happy.
What are they looking for?'


305
00:23:15.434 --> 00:23:17.232
THUNDER CLAPS

306
00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:28.248
BOBBY: The next day one paper said
that Baroe/ona didn't ,o/a y any footba//.


307
00:23:31.617 --> 00:23:33.244
Can you imagine that?

308
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:39.296
It's a wonderfully huge club,
but it's... it's kind of bonkers.


309
00:23:39.333 --> 00:23:40.300
It's a roadhouse.

310
00:23:42.002 --> 00:23:42.924
The team is winning.

311
00:23:42.962 --> 00:23:45.385
If I change it and we lose,
'Why do you change the team?'


312
00:23:45.422 --> 00:23:46.890
THEY SPEAKS SPANISH

313
00:23:47.549 --> 00:23:48.846
JOAN:
'O/d-fashioned man. '


314
00:23:48.884 --> 00:23:51.888
That is the idea many
of them had of Sir Bobby.


315
00:23:51.929 --> 00:23:54.899
HE YELLS IN SPANISH

316
00:23:54.932 --> 00:23:59.028
They were used to Johan Cruyff
who was sophisticated, a modern guy.


317
00:23:59.895 --> 00:24:02.569
If you write,
'No football, no football, no football.'


318
00:24:04.233 --> 00:24:05.735
'No system, no system, no system!

319
00:24:08.696 --> 00:24:10.448
Then the public will believe you.

320
00:24:12.074 --> 00:24:13.747
In a giant club

321
00:24:13.784 --> 00:24:19.006
l\/lr Flobson was in the middle
of politics and football together.


322
00:24:27.506 --> 00:24:29.975
JOSE:
The people was not against Bobby Robson.


323
00:24:30.801 --> 00:24:33.429
People were against NL?/iez.

324
00:24:48.902 --> 00:24:52.748
PEP: it's not easy to handle Barcelona,
especially especially in that period.


325
00:24:53.532 --> 00:24:58.083
/ /earned when / saw him
how /one/y the manager fee/s.


326
00:24:59.371 --> 00:25:03.877
And in the bad moments,
how always with the typical smile.


327
00:25:03.917 --> 00:25:06.011
For example, in my case, in that situation

328
00:25:06.045 --> 00:25:08.844
it would have been impossible
to react the way he react.


329
00:25:10.382 --> 00:25:11.929
THUNDER F¥Ul\/IBLES

330
00:25:19.725 --> 00:25:23.355
JOHN:
He was at his peak then at Barcelona.


331
00:25:24.938 --> 00:25:28.738
And we wanted Bobby for manager
for Newcastle United.


332
00:25:32.488 --> 00:25:34.661
January, 7997.

333
00:25:35.407 --> 00:25:39.207
We f/ew out to Berce/one
on different routes.


334
00:25:39.995 --> 00:25:40.996
We were doing an illegal approach.

335
00:25:41.955 --> 00:25:43.798
We had to sort of hide our intent.

336
00:25:43.832 --> 00:25:44.674
JOHN CHUCKLES

337
00:25:45.584 --> 00:25:49.714
A delegation came over and talked
to Dad and said they wanted him.


338
00:25:49.755 --> 00:25:54.636
So, incredible situation
of your hometown club.


339
00:25:54.676 --> 00:25:58.351
MARK:
You 're managing Barcelona. What to do?


340
00:26:00.849 --> 00:26:02.146
JOHN:
We met Bobby at the house.


341
00:26:02.184 --> 00:26:06.155
Beautiful garden, /ove/y sunny da y
and E/sie came out with drinks.


342
00:26:07.731 --> 00:26:09.904
We exp/e/ned that Ne wcest/e needed him

343
00:26:11.193 --> 00:26:13.366
and everyone would welcome him back.

344
00:26:16.698 --> 00:26:17.995
He agreed to come.

345
00:26:19.701 --> 00:26:21.044
We were de//gh ted.

346
00:26:25.999 --> 00:26:30.425
And when I rang him that night
and his voice was different.


347
00:26:31.797 --> 00:26:33.720
'You are not corning?' I said. 'Erm...'

348
00:26:33.757 --> 00:26:36.636
I said, 'You're not coming.'
'No, I'm not. I've changed my mind.'


349
00:26:41.223 --> 00:26:43.567
BOBBY: /fl had been in any
other s/tue tion but Barce/one


350
00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.227
that would have been for me

351
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:47.897
but / 'm at Barce/Ona
/ have a two-year contract


352
00:26:47.938 --> 00:26:49.281
the president stood by me.

353
00:26:49.314 --> 00:26:51.612
There was no way that / could
really leave the club.


354
00:26:57.948 --> 00:27:01.578
MARK: What Dad didn't know at that time
was that in his contract


355
00:27:01.618 --> 00:27:05.964
he could be after the first year
moved upstairs, as it were.


356
00:27:07.249 --> 00:27:10.002
JOSE:
/ signed my two- year contract //ke he did.


357
00:27:10.836 --> 00:27:12.930
I never thought that was the case.

358
00:27:14.756 --> 00:27:18.306
JOAN: Bobby thought he was go/ng to be coach
for Baroe/ona for two years.


359
00:27:18.343 --> 00:27:21.347
He didn't know that Barcelona
had planned


360
00:27:21.388 --> 00:27:24.312
to br/ng Louis van Gaa/ in 1997.

361
00:27:26.727 --> 00:27:28.104
He didn't know that at a//.

362
00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:34.030
Well if he knew it,
he would have taken on the Newcastle job.


363
00:27:34.067 --> 00:27:37.241
I think he probably would, yes, yeah.

364
00:27:40.407 --> 00:27:41.624
Gracias.

365
00:27:54.379 --> 00:27:57.929
ELSIE:
We grew up in a v///age called Langley Park


366
00:27:57.966 --> 00:28:00.219
northwest of the city of Durham.

367
00:28:02.095 --> 00:28:04.143
Very much in a mining community.

368
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:09.820
ALAN:
He was a typical boy from the northeast.


369
00:28:10.354 --> 00:28:15.451
As soon as he could walk, in this area,
you just have to love football.


370
00:28:15.484 --> 00:28:16.986
You just don't have a choice.

371
00:28:20.781 --> 00:28:22.704
BOBBY:
/Z' was a ritual for me


372
00:28:22.741 --> 00:28:24.789
when / was a
young boy with my father.

373
00:28:27.329 --> 00:28:30.833
We never missed a Ne wcast/e Un/ted
Hrst team game.


374
00:28:33.377 --> 00:28:34.799
And/ have to tel/ you this.

375
00:28:35.504 --> 00:28:39.759
We 'd be the first people at the gate
at 12 o'c/ook


376
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.269
almost three hours before the kick-off time.

377
00:28:43.512 --> 00:28:45.810
Thank you very much. 
Enjoy your day.

378

A//y anvbit/'on was to ,Ola y
for Newcastle United


379
00:28:55.732 --> 00:28:57.734
but the loce/ boy never seemed
to get e chance.


380
00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:59.736
And / thought, '
Thaz"s not for me. '

381
00:28:59.778 --> 00:29:02.327
/ need to go to a club where
/'m go/ng to be given en opportunity.


382
00:29:04.992 --> 00:29:08.087
When he got on the train at Durham
to go to Fulham


383
00:29:08.954 --> 00:29:12.128
and he was looking out the window,
you know, and he was waving


384
00:29:12.165 --> 00:29:16.545
well, I just broke down
to think that...


385
00:29:16.586 --> 00:29:18.304
Was he going to make the grade?

386
00:29:19.339 --> 00:29:21.137
Was he going to be alright?

387
00:29:25.012 --> 00:29:27.982
MAN:
C'mon, Bob! Your turn! Go, Bob, go, go!

00:29:29.016 --> 00:29:30.142

Good team player.

00:29:30.767 --> 00:29:32.235

00:29:42.612 --> 00:29:43.909
Did you sign those lads?

00:29:45.741 --> 00:29:47.994
And / remember buy/'ng
en evening paper


395

00:29:50.746 --> 00:29:52.168

Douglas to Hobson. And z'hat's it.


403
00:30:15.395 --> 00:30:17.272
A four-n// victory for England.

404
00:30:17.898 --> 00:30:19.741
Just my cuppa, mate.

405
00:30:21.151 --> 00:30:23.700
BOBBY: I've had no greater feeling
in football than that.

JAMES:
Well, we try.


409
00:30:37.709 --> 00:30:39.427
Yeah, very nice.
- Got to try and compete with you.


410
00:30:39.461 --> 00:30:41.179
Shirt's not too clever,

/ think the England job on/y comes

that it has.


415
00:31:00.357 --> 00:31:01.950
Where are you off to now?
The Ideal Home Exhibition?


416
00:31:01.983 --> 00:31:03.656
No.
- You're going home, are you?


417
00:31:03.693 --> 00:31:05.240
Marks and Sparks.

418
00:31:05.821 --> 00:31:08.074
You've just got to get it right.

419
00:31:08.115 --> 00:31:12.495
And if you get it right for the country,
it must be utopia.

CROWD CLAMOUHS

421
00:31:27.426 --> 00:31:29.724
COMMENTATOR:
As the England team /eff the ground


422
00:31:29.761 --> 00:31:34.813
an angry crowd had gathered to vent
their feelings face-to-face.


423
00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:36.602
GARY:
We were on the br/nk of go/ng out.


424
00:31:36.643 --> 00:31:38.236
Bobby was on the
br/'nk of losing his job.

425
00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:41.524
We want our money back!
That was an absolute disgrace


426
00:31:41.565 --> 00:31:42.908
That was abysmal!

427
00:31:42.941 --> 00:31:45.490
Robson out! Robson out!

428
00:31:45.527 --> 00:31:48.622
But just when it seemed
it was going to fall apart


429
00:31:48.655 --> 00:31:50.248
Bobby would find something.

430
00:31:50.282 --> 00:31:51.909
You are not out until you are out.

431
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:55.295
Now, if I surrender and throw
the white flag, everybody does


432
00:31:55.328 --> 00:31:56.329
and I am not going to do that.

433
00:31:58.248 --> 00:32:02.128
A change of system, a change of formula,
a change of personnel.


434
00:32:02.169 --> 00:32:04.137
Whatever it may be, he'd find a way.

435
00:32:04.171 --> 00:32:07.425
Go, pass, pass, pass, pass!

436
00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:10.678
BOBBY:
We have to win against Poland.


437
00:32:10.719 --> 00:32:12.642
We are still capable of doing that.

438
00:32:12.679 --> 00:32:14.602
All is not lost, that's all I'm saying.

COMMENTATOR:
L/neker!


441
00:32:24.649 --> 00:32:26.902
I was convinced I would be left out

442
00:32:26.943 --> 00:32:28.945
because I had not had a great start
to the World Cup.


443
00:32:30.238 --> 00:32:33.287
M/ynarczyk has m/sjuc/geo' it
and L/neker has a hat- trick!


444
00:32:36.453 --> 00:32:38.455
Bobby made my career what it was.

445
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.208
For some reason he stuck with me

446
00:32:41.249 --> 00:32:43.593
and I will be eternally grateful
to him for that

00:32:43.627 --> 00:32:46.972
because my life would have been
nowhere near as good without that.


448
00:32:48.006 --> 00:32:51.260
And here is Lineker onside, three-ni/_

449
00:32:51.927 --> 00:32:53.804
Argent/na await now.

450
00:32:56.848 --> 00:32:58.566
HE SPEAKS SPANISH

451
00:33:01.937 --> 00:33:05.237
BOBBY:
Argent/na with the great Maradona.


452
00:33:08.568 --> 00:33:10.445
/f he 'd played for us,
we wou/d have won the World Cup.


453
00:33:15.325 --> 00:33:17.077
GARY:
Quarter Hna/ of the World Cup.


454
00:33:17.827 --> 00:33:21.502
Two countries that were at war
in the not-too-distant past.


455
00:33:23.458 --> 00:33:26.337
HE SPEAKS SPANISH

456
00:33:29.422 --> 00:33:31.015
How does this look?
- I\/IAN: Alright.


457
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.017
Bobby mentioned it.

458
00:33:33.051 --> 00:33:35.725
Even amongst ourselves
you'd talk about it.


459
00:33:36.263 --> 00:33:39.062
BOBBY: if we get deflected
or distracted from the situation


460
00:33:39.099 --> 00:33:40.567
we 're in the middle of nowhere.

461
00:33:41.226 --> 00:33:43.399
We 're go/ng to give it
everything we've got.


462
00:33:44.145 --> 00:33:47.866
Feelings were heightened.
It was noticeable, it was in the air.


463
00:34:06.501 --> 00:34:08.344
HE SIGHS

464
00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:15.094
I haven't seen the television.
All I can go on is what I felt I saw.


465
00:34:16.011 --> 00:34:17.513
COMMENTATOR:
Ma/'ac/one is there, rises above Sh//ton.


466
00:34:17.554 --> 00:34:19.682
But is that goal go/ng to be allowed?

467
00:34:19.723 --> 00:34:22.101
/Z' was a handball,
no question about that.


468
00:34:24.144 --> 00:34:26.488
BOBBY:
Ma/'ac/Ona handled the ball into the goal.


469
00:34:26.521 --> 00:34:27.738
D/dn 'T he ?

470
00:34:29.983 --> 00:34:30.905
Didn't he?

471
00:34:33.111 --> 00:34:35.739
We don't expect decisions
like that at World Cup level.


472
00:34:38.575 --> 00:34:40.748
COMMENTATOR:
Ma/'ac/Ona turns //ke a //tt/e ee/.


473
00:34:40.785 --> 00:34:42.458
He comes away from trouble.

474
00:34:42.495 --> 00:34:45.465
The //tt/e squat man, comes /hs/de Butcher,
/eaves him for dead.


475
00:34:45.498 --> 00:34:47.091
Outside Fenwick,
/eaves him for dead


476
00:34:47.125 --> 00:34:48.593
than puts the ba// away

477
00:34:48.627 --> 00:34:51.801
and that is why Maradona
is the greatest p/a yer in the world.


478
00:34:53.632 --> 00:34:56.135
BOBBY: The first goa/ was
always going to be crucial.


479
00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.228
The first goal was
go/ng to win the match.


480
00:34:59.262 --> 00:35:03.563
MAN:
V/ve Argem'/na! V/ve Argentina!


481
00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:07.605
He was raging after that garne,
raging like I've never seen him before.


482
00:35:08.104 --> 00:35:10.903
If anybody is sorry at home
and a bit disappointed


483
00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:12.032
come in the dressing room

484
00:35:12.067 --> 00:35:13.444
come on with me in the dressing room.

485
00:35:14.819 --> 00:35:19.871
GARY: To cheat so blatantly like that
and than take the glory afterwards


486
00:35:19.908 --> 00:35:22.411
it went completely against
what Bobby stood for.


487
00:35:23.119 --> 00:35:24.416
He was a gentleman.

488
00:35:26.289 --> 00:35:29.668
BOBBY: He was at that time
the greatest p/a yer in the world.


489
00:35:30.669 --> 00:35:34.970
He did have the chance to be
the best sportsmen in the world


490
00:35:36.007 --> 00:35:37.224
but he refused it.

491
00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.978
He said it was the hand of God.

492
00:35:45.642 --> 00:35:48.395
/ said it was
the hand of a rascal.

493
00:35:51.731 --> 00:35:52.948
And /'m right.

494
00:36:06.037 --> 00:36:07.664
Yesterday was the first time we didn't shoot

495
00:36:07.706 --> 00:36:10.630
because yesterday
was the first time we had all 11 players.


496
00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.178
Before that we had five players.

497
00:36:15.797 --> 00:36:18.220
What attracted me to Bobby?

498
00:36:18.258 --> 00:36:19.885
The way he walked, I think.

499
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:30.192
ELSIE: Footballers have a certain
characteristic way of moving.


500
00:36:30.478 --> 00:36:32.355
ELSIE LAUGHS

501
00:36:34.482 --> 00:36:39.033
We just spotted each other,
as peep/e do, as couples do.


502
00:36:41.614 --> 00:36:44.538
JOSE: He was always say/ng
that his wife saved his //fe.


503
00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:50.958
HUVV:
Before the season in Barcelona


504
00:36:51.541 --> 00:36:55.387
she badgered him and he was made
to come for his appointment.


505
00:36:57.088 --> 00:36:58.340
A malignant melanoma

506
00:36:58.381 --> 00:37:02.102
is one of the worst diagnoses you can have
in the heed and neck.


507
00:37:06.014 --> 00:37:09.109
When he first saw
what had happened to him


508
00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.277
he burst into tears.

509
00:37:12.312 --> 00:37:14.360
HEART MONITOR BEEPS

510
00:37:14.397 --> 00:37:17.571
BOBBY:
/ had this obturator in my mouth.


511
00:37:17.609 --> 00:37:20.237
/t's //ke a pe/ate which keeps
my face in position.


512
00:37:21.654 --> 00:37:22.997
HUW:
Without that obturator


513
00:37:23.031 --> 00:37:26.410
his face would have effectively
fallen in on the /eff hand side.


514
00:37:29.412 --> 00:37:32.712
/n amongst a// the problems at Barcelona,
he wanted to see me.


515
00:37:33.708 --> 00:37:36.678
/ scoped him and there was a slightly
suspicious area


516
00:37:36.711 --> 00:37:38.213
within the original site.

517
00:37:41.257 --> 00:37:44.306
But I remember him saying,
'Whatever it is, you've got to sort it


518
00:37:44.344 --> 00:37:46.847
because there is no way
I'rn giving up this season!


519
00:37:54.312 --> 00:37:57.441
BOBBY: For the worst coach in the world,
/t's go/ng really fantastic.


520
00:38:00.026 --> 00:38:03.826
Because yesterday / read
that/ was the worst coach in the world.


521
00:38:04.781 --> 00:38:08.081
I find that incredible.
No respect and I find that a disgrace.


522
00:38:08.868 --> 00:38:13.169
That's the story.
And I am angry with you.


523
00:38:17.168 --> 00:38:18.385
JOAN :
He suffered.


524
00:38:21.089 --> 00:38:25.094
He had to fight a /ot in football
and in //fe.


525
00:38:28.096 --> 00:38:32.067
/n that moment, / think the board of directors
would have //ked Bobby to go.


526
00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.741
When you're driven like Bobby
and you have a bad time


527
00:38:39.774 --> 00:38:44.200
it's not so much the number of times
you get knocked down


528
00:38:45.029 --> 00:38:46.702
it's the number of times you get up.

529
00:38:46.739 --> 00:38:48.582
Do something about it.

530
00:38:48.616 --> 00:38:50.459
Your next morning
is your more important morning.


531
00:38:52.787 --> 00:38:55.085
ALEX:
Tomorrow is your da y.


532
00:38:57.333 --> 00:39:00.553
CHEMI:
March 12th, 7997.


533
00:39:00.587 --> 00:39:01.930
Oh, my God.

534
00:39:03.673 --> 00:39:05.767
One of the best nights in our lives.

535
00:39:07.844 --> 00:39:10.097
A crazy, crazy night.

536
00:39:13.641 --> 00:39:14.733
BOBBY:
/z' was two-two.


537
00:39:14.767 --> 00:39:19.398
In Spanish Cup football,
the away goals count double.


538
00:39:21.357 --> 00:39:22.700
Very //tt/e in it.

539
00:39:24.152 --> 00:39:25.495
So we though z'.

SPANISH COMMENTARY

541
00:39:44.547 --> 00:39:46.299
You are z'hree-n// down.

542
00:39:50.178 --> 00:39:51.304
Do something.

543
00:39:52.764 --> 00:39:55.768
Ano' / took off Laurent Blanc
and G/ca Popescu


544
00:39:55.808 --> 00:39:58.812
my two most experienced players.

545
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:05.451
There 's 700,000 people in
that stadium and they are baying.


546
00:40:09.489 --> 00:40:12.709
MARK: /z' was one of my worst feelings
I've had deep down.


547
00:40:14.369 --> 00:40:16.417
How is he feeling wa/k/ng up the tunnel?

548
00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.207
You know, that's my father.

549
00:40:20.166 --> 00:40:23.215
And if he loses that match,
he-'s lost his job, he-'s sacked.


550
00:40:25.171 --> 00:40:27.139
JOAN:
Louis van Gaa/ was in the crowd.


551
00:40:28.091 --> 00:40:31.721
And they had taken the decision
to get rid of Sir Bobby.


552
00:40:33.096 --> 00:40:34.439
I think so.

553
00:40:35.181 --> 00:40:38.685
JOSE: Such a powerful club,
/os/ng z'hree-n// at ha/f time.


554
00:40:38.726 --> 00:40:41.479
Would be hard to... to cope with it.

555
00:40:46.275 --> 00:40:48.698
We were absolutely devastated.

556
00:40:50.029 --> 00:40:52.908
PEP: Bobby said, 'We have to p/ay
the second ha/f with our pr/de.


557
00:40:53.533 --> 00:40:56.582
We cannot give up until the end.'

558
00:40:57.704 --> 00:40:59.832
He was talking to everyone

559
00:40:59.872 --> 00:41:03.797
making us believe we could
change that result.


560
00:41:06.587 --> 00:41:08.464
BOBBY:
/ didn't discuss the first ha/ii


561
00:41:10.049 --> 00:41:11.266
/t's gone.

562
00:41:11.843 --> 00:41:13.311
We 're al/ in this together.

563
00:41:17.223 --> 00:41:19.100
The difference is the wil/ and the want

564
00:41:19.142 --> 00:41:22.066
and the motivational force
that you can stir in your players


565
00:41:23.062 --> 00:41:26.566
to go out and
work to the bitter end.

566
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:34.158
Ano' if you oou/d
convey that to your players

567
00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:36.917
you 're on to a winner.

568
00:41:42.373 --> 00:41:44.876
Three-two and a big chance.

569
00:41:49.297 --> 00:41:51.220
And then the disaster of a goal.

570
00:41:53.843 --> 00:41:55.971
Another three gee/s to win.

571
00:41:56.012 --> 00:41:57.514
We were completely out of it.

572
00:41:58.222 --> 00:42:00.896
Unless the players are special.

573
00:42:01.642 --> 00:42:03.144
Are special.

574
00:42:16.532 --> 00:42:19.001
You ta/k with them every da y,
you train with them every day


575
00:42:19.035 --> 00:42:20.878
you mot/vate them every da y

576
00:42:21.537 --> 00:42:23.915
for times //ke this
when you are in trouble


577
00:42:25.083 --> 00:42:26.801

SPANISH COMMENTARY

00:42:52.068 --> 00:42:55.197
JOAN: The who/e Barge history
was there in one moment.


580
00:42:56.864 --> 00:42:58.116
/t was a miracle.

581
00:43:00.618 --> 00:43:06.421
I still have at home a VHS cassette
with this match.


582
00:43:06.457 --> 00:43:07.379
I still have it.

583
00:43:08.709 --> 00:43:10.962
My homage tonight is for the players.

584
00:43:11.003 --> 00:43:13.051
I've been in football 45 years and...

585
00:43:14.048 --> 00:43:16.142
I cannot remember 45 minutes like that.

586
00:43:17.969 --> 00:43:23.942
The way he was talking to us, you know,
make us feel like we have to do it for him.


587
00:43:25.518 --> 00:43:28.317
RONALDO:
He sa ved himself


588
00:43:30.189 --> 00:43:33.739
PEP: /know for him it was
a tough, tough ,oer/od.


589
00:43:34.986 --> 00:43:37.205
I learnt a lot, because in that period

590
00:43:37.238 --> 00:43:39.991
I thought I want to become a manager.

591
00:43:40.032 --> 00:43:43.332
And how he handled that situation,
it was incredible.


592
00:43:43.369 --> 00:43:44.621
I admire him a lot.

593
00:43:45.663 --> 00:43:47.381
/t doesn'z' matter what the media says

594
00:43:47.415 --> 00:43:48.758

00:43:50.001 --> 00:43:51.969
Always try to be ca/m.

The FA have agreed to release Mr Robson

from his contract as manager
of the England team.

The truth Wes, Bobby had been to/d

that his contract would not
be renewed after the World Cup

01:06:53.633 --> 01:06:56.432
Bobby accepted that situation
as ,oart of football


904
01:06:58.263 --> 01:06:59.936

916
01:08:06.122 --> 01:08:07.544

Stress in itself hes been

He wou/dn 't function properly

BOBBY: Do l need the hassle
of what football does to you?

Yeah, I need it,

his team that he /oved.

930

Eventually getting back to his hometown

If you're listening, gallery, Flobson's coming
into the press conference.

01:09:27.161 --> 01:09:29.038
It's like completing the circle.

Bobby, welcome home to Newcastle.

APPLAUSE

01:09:49.726 --> 01:09:51.148
REPORTER:
How about the age factor, Bobby?


942
01:09:51.185 --> 01:09:54.029
A lot of people have been mentioning
your 66 years of age?


943
01:09:54.063 --> 01:09:56.065
Yeah. You fancy a run of 100 metres?

944
01:09:56.107 --> 01:09:58.360
AUDIENCE LAUGHS

945
01:09:58.401 --> 01:10:01.575
You are either 66 years old
or 66 years young, aren't you?


946
01:10:01.612 --> 01:10:02.784
You know, you have a choice.

947
01:10:11.998 --> 01:10:13.545
ALAN:
Ne wcast/e were in turmoil.


948
01:10:14.917 --> 01:10:16.464
The dress/ng room was broke.

949
01:10:17.879 --> 01:10:21.975
And there is one guy
that could come and save Newcastle United.


950
01:10:29.307 --> 01:10:34.234
BOBBY: My background,
knowing what the Geordie pass/on is


951
01:10:34.854 --> 01:10:37.152
what football means to the Northeast

952

/ had a feeling for the club
and a des/re for the club


953
01:10:41.486 --> 01:10:43.864
that no other manager had.

954
01:10:50.244 --> 01:10:54.624
So when / came here,

JOHN LAUGHS

956
01:11:02.131 --> 01:11:05.055
Magnificent, wonderful, mind boggling.

957
01:11:07.136 --> 01:11:08.433
COMMENTATOR:
Shearer!


958
01:11:10.139 --> 01:11:12.858
JOHN: /z' was everything that the fans

959
01:11:14.185 --> 01:11:15.903
COMMENTATOR:
Shearer, a ha z'- trick!


960
01:11:15.937 --> 01:11:19.942
ALAN: /got #ve goals,
we scored eight as a team.


961
01:11:23.569 --> 01:11:25.492
And that was it,
we were back on the right track.


962
01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:27.328
And it was all thanks to Sir Bobby.

963
01:11:30.201 --> 01:11:31.418
BOBBY:
/t's beyond my W//dest dreams


964
01:11:31.452 --> 01:11:33.500
and beyond expectations
/ wou/o' have thought.


965
01:11:35.122 --> 01:11:37.921
So... not a bad start.

966
01:11:42.296 --> 01:11:44.344
PEP:
/'m go/ng to explain something secret.


967
01:11:46.634 --> 01:11:49.262
After the period in Barcelona,
he went to Newcastle


968
01:11:49.929 --> 01:11:54.935
and I sent him a mail to offer me
to go with him to play with Newcastle.


969
01:11:55.643 --> 01:11:58.988
And one of my dreams
would have been to play in England.


970
01:11:59.021 --> 01:12:02.150
He answers me and say,
'It is not possible


971
01:12:02.191 --> 01:12:05.661
because I have a lot of qualities,'
and I say, 'You are right'


972
01:12:06.654 --> 01:12:10.534
But even in the tough moments,
he was always so kind.


973
01:12:11.868 --> 01:12:15.463
He writes e s/mp/e /etter
that sometimes means more.


974
01:12:16.622 --> 01:12:20.627
It's beautiful... It's like he was...
You know?


975
01:12:22.336 --> 01:12:27.308
Bobby is one of the nicest, nicest persons
/ ever met in my //fe.


976
01:12:30.887 --> 01:12:33.356
BOBBY:
Left and right! Left and right!


977
01:12:33.389 --> 01:12:36.438
Pass, good pass, quality, good.

978
01:12:38.394 --> 01:12:42.695
When I see Bobby Robson
I think about that word 'enthusiastic.'


979
01:12:42.732 --> 01:12:46.862
So, come on, Thom, play, play, play!
Yeah!


980
01:12:46.861 --> 01:12:52.459
When I got to my mid-60s
it's very difficult to keep your enthusiasm.


981
01:12:52.491 --> 01:12:56.541
Niki for Roy! Niki for Roy!
SHOUTS AT PLAYERS


982
01:12:56.704 --> 01:12:58.877
People ta/k about what makes
a great manager.


983
01:12:59.457 --> 01:13:02.336
Well, we-'ve got other things
to do now.


984
01:13:03.961 --> 01:13:06.009
Other things to do now.
You've got to forget about that.


985
01:13:06.714 --> 01:13:08.057
That's football.

986
01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:12.436
Someone who can create
en energy source for as /eng as he's done


987
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:14.063
/z"s something special.

988
01:13:14.096 --> 01:13:17.646
Talk, talk!
Talk for it, go on, like I'm talking to you!


989
01:13:18.726 --> 01:13:20.524
It's like a bloody mouse sometimes!

990
01:13:20.561 --> 01:13:22.814
You can't go down the chem/st's
and buy that.


991
01:13:26.776 --> 01:13:30.076
FRANK: At PSV where we were
in our tra/ning ground


992
01:13:30.112 --> 01:13:33.958
it's surrounded by trees,
it's a beautiful place.


993
01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:38.045
When we have two or three /eps,
he stopped


994
01:13:38.079 --> 01:13:40.298
and said, 'Liste-n, guys, look around,
take a look.


995
01:13:41.123 --> 01:13:42.090
Is it not beautiful?

996
01:13:42.124 --> 01:13:44.343
You could have been now,
it's now 10 o'olock


997
01:13:44.377 --> 01:13:47.881
you could have been now in the factory
from seven o'clock to five o'olock


998
01:13:47.922 --> 01:13:49.014
and you wouldn't

999
01:13:49.048 --> 01:13:50.425
you wouldn't experience this.'

1000
01:13:51.759 --> 01:13:52.931
That was Bobby.

1001
01:13:55.888 --> 01:13:59.392
That foundation he got
through his parents


1002
01:13:59.433 --> 01:14:02.027
mining district, working-class people

1003
01:14:03.437 --> 01:14:05.064
those values never /eff him.

1004
01:14:08.109 --> 01:14:09.986
JOHN:
They are very much soc/a/ist values.


1005
01:14:12.488 --> 01:14:15.458
When you /ive in a mining village,
you /ive in a community.


1006
01:14:17.827 --> 01:14:19.329
/z"s never about yourse/ri

1007
01:14:22.164 --> 01:14:23.711
/t's always about other people.

1008
01:14:25.835 --> 01:14:30.341
ALAN: /fit wash 't for him,
then / would have /eft the football club.


1009
01:14:32.383 --> 01:14:34.306
I wasn't getting on with
the previous management.


1010
01:14:34.343 --> 01:14:36.220
I didn't know where to go,
I didn't know what to do


1011
01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:37.597
what I was doing right,
what I was doing wrong.


1012
01:14:38.973 --> 01:14:41.817
He knew stra/ghta way
what made me tick.


1013
01:14:42.727 --> 01:14:45.901
He saved Newcastle
and he also saved my career.

COMMENTATOR:
Shearer!


1015
01:14:52.987 --> 01:14:56.332
He took e football o/ub
from the bottom of the Premier League


1016
01:14:56.365 --> 01:14:57.912
into Champions League football.

1017
01:14:58.576 --> 01:15:00.328
COMMENTATOR:
And a chance for Ameobi!


1018

1022

Has there ever been a more dramatic night
in the Champions League?


1023
01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:25.653
Looking at Newcastle

1024
01:15:25.686 --> 01:15:29.941
I think they had something like

1025
01:15:31.067 --> 01:15:33.365
He was the one manager
who brought stability.


1026
01:15:33.402 --> 01:15:35.746
Want to win it, want to pass it,
want to get it.

01:15:36.572 --> 01:15:39.701
Good luck, eh. Come on.

/ don't want to overstay

REPORTER:
Can you do something for level, Bobby?

Yes. No breakfast, but lunch.

01:16:15.903 --> 01:16:17.075
That's nice.
- Thank you.

With peas?
- No, beans.


1042
01:16:18.864 --> 01:16:19.990
Very good.

1043
01:16:20.032 --> 01:16:23.912
I used to think to myself,
'Is this guy all there?'


1044
01:16:25.412 --> 01:16:27.915
Yeah, but if you ask me rude questions

1045
01:16:27.957 --> 01:16:31.632
I'll kill you on screen,
so come on, let's go!


1046
01:16:32.002 --> 01:16:33.424
He was funny
and he didn't mean to be funny.


1047
01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:34.592
Sometimes he didn't know he was funny.

1048
01:16:36.549 --> 01:16:38.267
Oh!

1049
01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:40.974
But d'you know what,
it was all part of him.

Right, do you want me autograph?

1051
01:16:42.596 --> 01:16:44.473
KIDS CHEEH

1052
01:16:46.433 --> 01:16:49.232
Yes, he was likeable and all that,
but boy he had an edge.


1053
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:52.945
REPORTER: Sir Bobby you took the job
in 1983 as England manager.


1054
01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:56.240
What were your feelings...
- No, actually, '82 actually.


1055
01:16:56.277 --> 01:16:57.950
'82.
- Get it right.


1056
01:16:58.112 --> 01:16:59.489
Start again, eh? '82.

1057
01:16:59.530 --> 01:17:00.702
BOBBY:
/ tel/ you what.


1058
01:17:00.739 --> 01:17:03.663
If you're not bright,
if you don't know answers


1059
01:17:03.701 --> 01:17:06.625
if you don't know football,
they will bury you.


1060
01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:08.247
And they haven't buried me.
Not yet.


1061
01:17:09.248 --> 01:17:10.249
Bye bye.

1062
01:17:15.254 --> 01:17:19.350
REPORTER: Does your wife Elsie
approve of your continual work/ng


1063
01:17:19.383 --> 01:17:21.056
at this most demanding /eve/?

1064
01:17:22.094 --> 01:17:23.767
BOBBY: Off the record,
she thinks /'m bloody stupid.


1065
01:17:23.804 --> 01:17:25.226
She thinks /'m crazy.

1066
01:17:28.851 --> 01:17:32.025
ELSIE: He would always talk to anybody
about football, always.


1067
01:17:32.021 --> 01:17:33.864
Did you ever see Bobby Moore play?

1068
01:17:33.898 --> 01:17:35.866
When he was in position,
he always could plant it


1069
01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:37.743
and he could always drop into the hole.

1070
01:17:38.194 --> 01:17:41.789
Nothing was as urgent as just speaking
to someone about the game.


1071
01:17:41.822 --> 01:17:44.371
And he's a great penalty taker, you know?
'Cause he knows...


1072
01:17:44.992 --> 01:17:47.620
He always makes up his mind what he's
gonna do and never deviates from it.


1073
01:17:47.661 --> 01:17:49.038
That was the urgency.

1074
01:17:50.539 --> 01:17:53.463
If you hit that well,
you'll be out in the next parish, yeah.


1075
01:17:54.168 --> 01:17:56.717
BOBBY: My wife keeps say/ng to me,
'You must take time for you/'se/ii '


1076
01:17:56.754 --> 01:17:58.176
A/ex Ferguson said that to me.

1077
01:17:58.881 --> 01:18:02.260
What, three is the right club?
For me.


1078
01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:08.396
'Take time for you/'se/Ji
Take time to smell the roses. '


1079
01:18:10.893 --> 01:18:16.821
I hope you got that.
I hope you got that! By Christ!


1080
01:18:18.359 --> 01:18:20.532
ELSIE:
We had this kind of agreement


1081
01:18:20.569 --> 01:18:24.415
that when he was at home,
we didn't ta/k a /ot about football.


1082
01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:30.956
He didn't talk to me intimately
about those thoughts


1083
01:18:30.996 --> 01:18:32.714
that were going round in his head.

1084
01:18:35.793 --> 01:18:37.090
MARK:
Dad was immersed in it.


1085
01:18:38.087 --> 01:18:40.089
We don't see him much, if at a//.

1086
01:18:41.048 --> 01:18:42.675
And we were al/ passionate about football

1087
01:18:42.716 --> 01:18:44.810
but we never had the chance to ta/k.

1088
01:18:45.719 --> 01:18:47.892
He didn't want to be separated,
but he was.


1089
01:18:51.392 --> 01:18:52.689
That was a shame

1090
01:18:54.144 --> 01:18:56.613
because lots of people say to /779,
you know


1091
01:18:56.647 --> 01:18:59.776
'What was it like talking to your dad
about certain players or matche-s?'


1092
01:18:59.817 --> 01:19:02.741
And I say, 'Well, I never did,
literally never did.'


1093
01:19:05.781 --> 01:19:08.830
BOBBY: Are there any times
when / don't //'ke Bobby Robson?


1094
01:19:11.996 --> 01:19:14.044
/ spent maybe too much time
at the club


1095
01:19:14.081 --> 01:19:15.583
when / should have been home
e bit earlier.


1096
01:19:17.042 --> 01:19:20.296
/ fee/ that / have been removed
from my fam//y


1097
01:19:21.088 --> 01:19:25.810
and / didn't give my family the time
that most husbands do, / think.


1098
01:19:39.857 --> 01:19:41.609
CROWD ROARS

1099
01:19:47.573 --> 01:19:50.372
JOHN:
/z' was the sem/-Hna/ of the UEFA Cup.


1100
01:19:51.118 --> 01:19:53.746
We /ost and e depression
came over the club.


1101
01:19:56.206 --> 01:19:58.425
We al/ took it bad/y
and the fans took it bad/y.


1102
01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:01.337
There? Other side? OK.

1103
01:20:01.378 --> 01:20:04.052
ALAN:
/t was becoming a very d/fHcu/t per/od.


1104
01:20:04.089 --> 01:20:06.342
There were young players
who had issues.


1105
01:20:06.383 --> 01:20:09.182
You won't get much out of me,
it's a wasted question.


1106
01:20:09.219 --> 01:20:11.517
REPORTER 1: Well, I just think
we look silly if we don't ask it.


1107
01:20:11.555 --> 01:20:14.058
You can, but it's a wasted question.
- OK, fine.


1108
01:20:14.099 --> 01:20:16.443
REPORTER 2: Can you clear up all the talk
of a training ground bust-up?


1109
01:20:16.477 --> 01:20:17.945
BOBBY:
It's a storm in a teacup.


1110
01:20:17.978 --> 01:20:19.605
No, I never say I'd settle for nil-nil.

1111
01:20:19.646 --> 01:20:21.648
When did I say I'd settle for nil-nil?

1112
01:20:21.690 --> 01:20:23.784
I'rn not prepared to comment
about the incident.


1113
01:20:23.817 --> 01:20:26.366
The incident is closed,
it's been dealt with.


1114
01:20:26.403 --> 01:20:28.121
We will speak to him today,
obviously, firmly.


1115
01:20:28.155 --> 01:20:32.080
And we don't have a single second
of problems.


1116
01:20:35.829 --> 01:20:38.708
ALAN:
Players were on so much money


1117
01:20:39.666 --> 01:20:42.886
and not showing him
and the football club respect


1118
01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.173
which he found very d/fHcu/t.

1119
01:20:47.966 --> 01:20:50.515
FREDDY: Many times players
were out of order with him.


1120
01:20:50.552 --> 01:20:52.680
He said, 'No, we '// give
them another chance. '


1121
01:20:53.263 --> 01:20:55.982
He cou/d never find the dark side
of anybody.


1122
01:20:56.016 --> 01:20:57.984
How's my hair, alright?

1123
01:20:58.018 --> 01:21:00.020
Alright? Just come off
the training ground. OK?


1124
01:21:01.355 --> 01:21:04.108
First team players approached
Freddy Shepherd


1125
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:06.322
and said, 'You're going
to have to do something.


1126
01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:09.534
There's problems in the dressing room,
problems with the players.'


1127
01:21:09.571 --> 01:21:11.665
But Bobby still felt he could do it.

1128
01:21:11.698 --> 01:21:12.699
REPORTER:
Good luck, Sir Bobby.


1129
01:21:12.699 --> 01:21:13.871
Thank you.

1130
01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:17.792
BOBBY:
/'m Hghting attitudes.


1131
01:21:19.081 --> 01:21:21.504
And if / ha Ve
2"O fight if, /'// f/Qght it.

1132
01:21:30.342 --> 01:21:32.936
REPORTER 1: Newcastle Un/ted
are tonight stepping up their Search


1133
01:21:32.970 --> 01:21:33.971
for a new manager.

1134
01:21:34.012 --> 01:21:36.606
REPORTER 2: Newcastle Un/ted manager,
Sir Bobby Robson, is sacked.


1135
01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:39.769
REPORTER 1: closing the book on one
of football's greatest characters.


1136
01:21:41.186 --> 01:21:43.484
What I've come out for is to show
you a bit of courtesy.


1137
01:21:43.522 --> 01:21:45.399
Because you could stay here
for seven hours


1138
01:21:45.441 --> 01:21:46.738
and I don't want you to do that.

1139
01:21:46.775 --> 01:21:48.618
You've got a home and a family
to go to I should think


1140
01:21:48.652 --> 01:21:49.824
and I would suggest
that you do that.


1141
01:21:52.364 --> 01:21:53.786
FREDDY:
/z' was //ke shooting Bambi.


1142
01:21:55.617 --> 01:21:58.336
But as chairman of the club,
/ had to do it.


1143
01:22:00.873 --> 01:22:04.594
I don't think there was a person
in this world who could understand it.


1144
01:22:05.461 --> 01:22:06.804
ALEX:
/ cou/drl'z' be//eve it.


1145
01:22:09.339 --> 01:22:11.341
JOHN:
/ was bas/ca//y in favour.


1146
01:22:11.884 --> 01:22:14.558
If you cannot pull
your dressing room together


1147
01:22:14.595 --> 01:22:16.313
then you've got a problem

1148
01:22:16.346 --> 01:22:19.350
and management get paid
for making these decisions.


1149
01:22:20.893 --> 01:22:24.272
/t actually didn't start from us,
it started with the players.


1150
01:22:25.272 --> 01:22:26.945
They were cruel in many, many ways.

1151
01:22:28.650 --> 01:22:31.199
They were responsible
for getting Bobby the sack.


1152
01:22:33.322 --> 01:22:34.949
ALEX:
/t was a club of confusion.


1153
01:22:36.158 --> 01:22:37.284
They should have been say/ng

1154
01:22:37.326 --> 01:22:41.172
'Bobby, I want you to bring the man
who is gonna replace you


1155
01:22:41.205 --> 01:22:45.335
to continue with someone who believes
in what you've done here


1156
01:22:45.375 --> 01:22:46.843
and make it an institution.

1157
01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:50.343
JOHN: DeHnite/y, we wanted
him to go upstairs


1158
01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:55.056
and to be an ambassador for the club
and to do what he's good at.


1159
01:22:55.093 --> 01:22:58.723
That was the difference of opinion
between Freddy and Bobby at the time.


1160
01:23:01.433 --> 01:23:04.357
ALAN:
When you /ook at Newcastle Un/ted now


1161
01:23:04.394 --> 01:23:06.067
and over the years once he had left

1162
01:23:07.064 --> 01:23:09.487
you certainly rea//se
what an incredible job he had done.


1163
01:23:10.859 --> 01:23:12.782
I think it was a hasty decision, yeah.

1164
01:23:14.696 --> 01:23:16.994
I've had five fabulous years
here with everybody.


1165
01:23:18.283 --> 01:23:20.752
BOBBY:
And / wil/ be their biggest fan after this.


1166
01:23:20.786 --> 01:23:23.039
Not been easy for me today,
but that's football


1167
01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.878
and I have to
get on with my life.

1168
01:23:26.375 --> 01:23:29.504
He was very heartbroken
when he was guillotined.


1169
01:23:31.838 --> 01:23:35.638
He didn't recover
from that very quickly, at all.


1170
01:23:35.676 --> 01:23:37.724
REPORTER: Will you be going on to
manage another olub in the future?


1171
01:23:37.761 --> 01:23:39.308
Well, I have nothing to say about that.

1172
01:23:39.346 --> 01:23:40.313
I'm just...

1173
01:23:41.223 --> 01:23:43.897
Getting over the situation
and I'll think about


1174
01:23:43.934 --> 01:23:49.612
what I have to do for the rest of my life
when it all settles down.


1175
01:23:49.648 --> 01:23:51.742
Thank you very much.
- REPORTER: Thanks very much.


1176
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:56.705
MARK: That was the Crue//est cut
to him in his who/e career.


1177
01:23:58.282 --> 01:23:59.579
His world fel/ apart.

1178
01:24:00.701 --> 01:24:02.294
We can't be/ie ve it st///.

1179
01:24:04.663 --> 01:24:05.664
Brute/.

1180
01:24:16.466 --> 01:24:18.514
PAUL:
He was obsessed with football.


1181
01:24:19.928 --> 01:24:22.056
Totally obsessed with football.

1182
01:24:22.097 --> 01:24:24.941
This is what I'd have been doing
if it wasn't for Sir Bobby.


1183
01:24:26.727 --> 01:24:28.024
Cheers, Sir Bobby.

1184
01:24:29.146 --> 01:24:31.023
I'd have been like that,
wheelin' a barrow.


1185
01:24:33.734 --> 01:24:36.863
I guarantee if you named a player,
any player in the world


1186
01:24:36.903 --> 01:24:40.157
he would know what he had for breakfast,
what number his house was


1187
01:24:40.198 --> 01:24:43.998
what country he comes from,
how old he is, the whole lot.


1188
01:24:44.036 --> 01:24:45.379
He was obsessed.

1189
01:24:49.166 --> 01:24:52.010
When he got sacked, he rang us up
and he said, 'What you do/ng?'


1190
01:24:52.628 --> 01:24:54.255
/ said, 'Noth/ng, /'m sitting here bored. '

1191
01:24:54.296 --> 01:24:56.014
He went, '/'m coming
to pick you up. '

1192
01:25:01.261 --> 01:25:04.060
I've had my troubles
and my bad ways in me //fe but...

was on the phone tw/ce a week:

01:25:07.643 --> 01:25:09.566
'Are you OK? Do you want help?

Where are you? 
Can I come and see you?'

01:25:13.523 --> 01:25:15.867
It got to the stage where strangers
would come up to us


1197
01:25:15.901 --> 01:25:20.327

and I had to say, 'Has Sir Bobby sent you?'

'Yeah.' Tell him I'rn OK today.
I don't know about tomorrow.

to spend most of his time
worrying about me

The most dramatic thing for me at the time

This isn't live, is it?
