1
00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:22.460
It's intensely contemplative.

2
00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:29.008
It is almost hypnotic.

3
00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:38.393
It's like putting your hand
on the third rail of the universe.


4
00:00:39.852 --> 00:00:42.689
If you play Go seriously,

5
00:00:42.772 --> 00:00:46.192
there is a chance
that you will get exposed


6
00:00:46.275 --> 00:00:50.238
to this experience that...

7
00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:53.992
is kind of like nothing else
on the planet.


8
00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:56.828
Go is putting you in a place

9
00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:01.291
where you're always
at the very farthest reaches


10
00:01:01.374 --> 00:01:02.667
of your capacity.

11
00:01:04.419 --> 00:01:06.504
There's a reason
that people have been playing Go


12
00:01:06.587 --> 00:01:08.307
for thousands and thousands
of years, right?


13
00:01:09.632 --> 00:01:11.759
It's not just that they want
to understand Go.


14
00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:16.472
They want to understand
what understanding is.


15
00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:21.728
And maybe that is truly
what it means to be human.


16
00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:29.360
When I was a kid,
I loved playing games.


17
00:01:30.445 --> 00:01:33.114
I started off with board games like chess.

18
00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:36.701
And then I bought my first computer
when I was eight


19
00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:38.494
with winnings from a chess tournament.

20
00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:42.415
Ever since then, 
I felt that computers

21
00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:46.711
were this sort of magical device
that could extend the power of your mind.


22
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.965
Virtual environments and games,

23
00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:55.386
we think they're the perfect platform
for developing and testing AI algorithms.


24
00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.557
Games are very convenient,
in that a lot of them have scores,


25
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.727
so it's very easy
to measure incremental progress.


26
00:02:03.102 --> 00:02:07.106
So I'm going to show you a few videos
of the agent system, the AI.


27
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.067
So let's start off with Breakout.

28
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.110
So here you control the bat and ball,

29
00:02:11.194 --> 00:02:13.594
and you're trying to break
through this rainbow-colored wall.


30
00:02:13.988 --> 00:02:16.741
The agent system has to learn
everything for itself,


31
00:02:16.824 --> 00:02:18.284
just from the raw pixels.

32
00:02:18.368 --> 00:02:20.036
It doesn't know what it's controlling.

33
00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:22.747
It doesn't even know
what the object of the game is.


34
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.001
Now, at the beginning, after 100 games,
you can see the agent is not very good.


35
00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:28.711
It's missing the ball most of the time.

36
00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:30.671
But it's starting to get
the hang of the idea


37
00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:32.355
that the bat should go towards the ball.

38
00:02:33.341 --> 00:02:34.842
Now, after 300 games,

39
00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:37.220
it's about as good
as any human can play this,


40
00:02:37.303 --> 00:02:39.555
and pretty much gets
the ball back every time.


41
00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.075
We thought, "Well, that's pretty cool."

42
00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.726
But we left the system playing
for another 200 games,


43
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.061
and it did this amazing thing.

44
00:02:45.144 --> 00:02:46.437
It found the optimal strategy

45
00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:48.481
was to dig a tunnel around the side.

46
00:02:48.564 --> 00:02:50.324
And put the ball
around the back of the wall.


47
00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.778
The researchers working on this,
the amazing AI developers,


48
00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:57.073
well, they're not so good at Breakout,
and they didn't know about that strategy.


49
00:02:57.156 --> 00:02:59.009
So, they learned something
from their own system,


50
00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:01.577
which is, uh, you know,
pretty funny and quite instructive,


51
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:04.413
I think, about the potential
for general AI.


52
00:03:04.872 --> 00:03:07.125
So, for us, what's the next step now?

53
00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:10.711
Go is the most complex game,
pretty much, ever devised by man.


54
00:03:10.795 --> 00:03:12.630
Beating a professional player at Go

55
00:03:12.713 --> 00:03:16.134
is a long-standing, grand challenge
of AI research.


56
00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:38.239
Wow.

57
00:03:39.824 --> 00:03:41.617
You really want to kill me, yeah?

58
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.829
No, I don't want to,
but I'm trying to survive.


59
00:03:44.912 --> 00:03:46.164
Yes, that's it. That's it.

60
00:03:46.247 --> 00:03:48.207
I am a Go professional player.

61
00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:49.876
I am also a European Champion.

62
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.919
With that move,

63
00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:53.546
you're going to lose for sure.

64
00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.340
You were happy to defeat me
but then you panicked.


65
00:03:56.841 --> 00:04:00.052
You're afraid that victory
will escape you.


66
00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:03.764
In general, when you're afraid,
victory always escapes you.


67
00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:07.435
I was born in China.

68
00:04:07.894 --> 00:04:11.105
When I was 18, 
I wanted to change my life.

69
00:04:11.647 --> 00:04:13.399
That was why I went to France.

70
00:04:14.358 --> 00:04:16.736
I wanted to try to forget Go.

71
00:04:18.112 --> 00:04:19.530
But it was impossible.

72
00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:24.202
Because all the things I learned
in my life was through Go.


73
00:04:25.286 --> 00:04:26.662
It looks like a mirror.

74
00:04:27.455 --> 00:04:30.791
When I see Go, 
I also see myself.

75
00:04:32.502 --> 00:04:34.629
For me, Go is real life.

76
00:04:40.468 --> 00:04:41.677
Dear Mr. Fan.

77
00:04:42.053 --> 00:04:43.679
My name is Demis Hassabis.

78
00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.643
I run an artificial intelligence company
based in London called DeepMind.


79
00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:51.521
As the strongest Go player in Europe,

80
00:04:51.604 --> 00:04:54.148
we would like to invite you
to our offices in London,


81
00:04:54.232 --> 00:04:56.651
both to meet you in person
and to share with you


82
00:04:56.734 --> 00:04:59.070
an exciting Go project
that we are working on.


83
00:05:00.112 --> 00:05:02.032
If you would be interested
in coming to visit us,


84
00:05:02.114 --> 00:05:03.282
please let us know.

85
00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:07.036
Many thanks. Kind regards, Demis.

86
00:05:08.496 --> 00:05:10.414
When I saw this e-mail,

87
00:05:10.498 --> 00:05:12.792
I didn't know if
it was true or not.

88
00:05:14.168 --> 00:05:16.295
I will accept this. Why not?

89
00:05:18.256 --> 00:05:20.174
For me, everything is an adventure.

90
00:05:21.842 --> 00:05:23.469
I want to go visit DeepMind

91
00:05:23.553 --> 00:05:27.932
to know what this Go project is.

92
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:34.772
On my first visit,
I thought maybe they wanted me


93
00:05:34.855 --> 00:05:36.691
to sit in a special room,

94
00:05:36.774 --> 00:05:39.402
attach numerous wires to my head,

95
00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:41.279
and also my body,

96
00:05:41.362 --> 00:05:44.615
let me play to scan my brain.

97
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:46.284
I don't know,

98
00:05:47.034 --> 00:05:48.452
to make some research.

99
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.330
We needed to get Fan Hui
to DeepMind


100
00:05:51.414 --> 00:05:54.959
to see we were a serious operation,
and we were serious people...


101
00:05:55.793 --> 00:05:56.877
doing proper research.

102
00:05:58.337 --> 00:06:00.298
And the search time
is getting better and better


103
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:03.217
as we go from, for example,
one to eight, in any one of these,


104
00:06:03.301 --> 00:06:05.011
it always goes up.

105
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:07.388
We think of DeepMind as...

106
00:06:07.471 --> 00:06:10.266
kind of like an Apollo program effort
for AI.


107
00:06:11.225 --> 00:06:14.478
Our mission is to fundamentally
understand intelligence,


108
00:06:14.562 --> 00:06:16.230
and recreate it artificially.

109
00:06:16.564 --> 00:06:17.804
And then, once we've done that,

110
00:06:17.857 --> 00:06:21.319
we feel that we can use
that technology to help society


111
00:06:21.402 --> 00:06:23.279
solve all sorts of other problems.

112
00:06:23.362 --> 00:06:24.905
If you step through
the actual game,


113
00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:27.533
we can see, kind of, how AlphaGo thinks,

114
00:06:27.616 --> 00:06:30.703
what's the most likely variation
that it thinks will happen.


115
00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:32.621
We've been working
on AlphaGo,


116
00:06:32.705 --> 00:06:36.000
our program to play Go,
for just under two years now.


117
00:06:36.584 --> 00:06:38.627
All the little patterns cascade together,

118
00:06:38.711 --> 00:06:40.713
layer after layer, after layer,
after layer.


119
00:06:41.714 --> 00:06:46.052
I started talking about the game of Go
with Demis more than 20 years ago.


120
00:06:46.135 --> 00:06:48.554
And so, this has been
a really long journey.


121
00:06:48.637 --> 00:06:52.058
The game of Go is the holy grail
of artificial intelligence.


122
00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:54.393
For many years,
people have looked at this game


123
00:06:54.477 --> 00:06:57.104
and they have thought,
"Wow, this is just too hard."


124
00:06:57.188 --> 00:06:59.190
Everything we have ever tried in AI,

125
00:06:59.273 --> 00:07:01.442
it just falls over
when you try the game of Go.


126
00:07:01.525 --> 00:07:04.904
And so that's why it feels like
a real litmus test of progress.


127
00:07:04.987 --> 00:07:07.698
If we can crack Go,
we know we've done something special.


128
00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:11.869
So with Fan Hui,
we started talking around


129
00:07:11.952 --> 00:07:13.871
what the real purpose of the visit was.

130
00:07:13.954 --> 00:07:16.624
It wasn't just a Go project
we wanted him to help with,


131
00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:20.211
that actually we wanted to play him,
and we had a very strong program.


132
00:07:20.294 --> 00:07:21.921
It's okay, it's just a program.

133
00:07:22.004 --> 00:07:23.631
It's so easy.

134
00:07:23.714 --> 00:07:25.091
So, it will be easy to play.

135
00:07:25.508 --> 00:07:28.094
A lot of people have thought
that it was decades away.


136
00:07:28.177 --> 00:07:29.613
Some people thought it would be never.

137
00:07:29.637 --> 00:07:34.934
Because they felt that to succeed at Go,
you needed human intuition.


138
00:07:36.143 --> 00:07:40.398
Go is the world's oldest
continuously played board game.


139
00:07:40.481 --> 00:07:41.941
And, in some sense,

140
00:07:42.024 --> 00:07:46.112
it is one of the simplest
and also most abstract.


141
00:07:46.612 --> 00:07:47.988
There's only one type of piece.

142
00:07:48.072 --> 00:07:49.216
There's only one type of move.

143
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.800
You just place that piece on the board.

144
00:07:51.283 --> 00:07:56.539
And then, your goal is to create
a linked group of your stones


145
00:07:56.622 --> 00:07:58.374
that surrounds some empty territory.

146
00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:01.752
And when you surround enemy stones,

147
00:08:01.836 --> 00:08:04.296
you capture them,
and remove them from the board.


148
00:08:05.297 --> 00:08:07.591
You earn points by surrounding territory.

149
00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:12.012
And, at the end of the game,
the person with the most territory wins.


150
00:08:13.055 --> 00:08:14.849
It seems really simple.

151
00:08:14.932 --> 00:08:17.810
But, then you sit down to play,
and you realize right away,


152
00:08:17.893 --> 00:08:21.147
it's like, "Well, I technically know
what I'm allowed to do,


153
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.023
but I have no
clue what I should do."

154
00:08:23.107 --> 00:08:25.735
Go is incredibly challenging
for computers to tackle


155
00:08:25.818 --> 00:08:27.862
because compared to, say, chess,

156
00:08:27.945 --> 00:08:31.031
the number of possible moves
in a position is much larger.


157
00:08:31.115 --> 00:08:32.533
In chess, it's about 20.

158
00:08:32.616 --> 00:08:34.452
In Go, it's about 200.

159
00:08:34.535 --> 00:08:37.413
And the number of possible
configurations of the board


160
00:08:37.496 --> 00:08:39.957
is more than the number
of atoms in the universe.


161
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.543
So even if you took all
the computers in the world,


162
00:08:42.626 --> 00:08:44.044
and ran them for a million years,

163
00:08:44.128 --> 00:08:48.466
that wouldn't be enough compute power
to calculate all the possible variations.


164
00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:52.344
If you ask a great Go player
why they played a particular move,


165
00:08:52.428 --> 00:08:54.847
sometimes, they will just tell you
it felt right.


166
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.725
So, we have to come up
with some kind of clever algorithm


167
00:08:57.808 --> 00:09:00.603
to mimic what people do
with their intuition.


168
00:09:01.645 --> 00:09:03.981
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, hello. Nice to meet you, too.


169
00:09:04.064 --> 00:09:07.067
So with Fan Hui, we agreed
a best-of-five match.


170
00:09:07.151 --> 00:09:09.236
And we agreed it would be filmed.

171
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.160
You know, we would treat it
as a serious match.


172
00:09:13.908 --> 00:09:15.576
I played with AlphaGo.

173
00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:18.621
Aja Huang pushed the stones for AlphaGo.

174
00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:22.208
And, of course, I thought I will win
the game with AlphaGo


175
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:23.834
because it's just a program.

176
00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:25.919
Good game.

177
00:09:26.587 --> 00:09:27.587
Have a nice game.

178
00:09:31.133 --> 00:09:33.928
The first game,
I made some mistakes,


179
00:09:34.011 --> 00:09:35.846
and I lost the game.

180
00:09:36.388 --> 00:09:39.642
Oh. Strange. Very strange game.

181
00:09:40.059 --> 00:09:42.978
In that first match,
I think something clicked for him


182
00:09:43.062 --> 00:09:46.774
that this wasn't an ordinary Go program.

183
00:09:46.857 --> 00:09:49.860
We weren't just doing
the same as everyone else,


184
00:09:49.944 --> 00:09:51.445
that something new was happening.

185
00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:54.156
The second game,
I tried to change my style.


186
00:09:54.824 --> 00:09:57.993
But the problem
is I also lost the second game.


187
00:09:58.077 --> 00:09:59.912
And also the third game,

188
00:09:59.995 --> 00:10:01.121
the fourth game,

189
00:10:01.622 --> 00:10:02.748
even the last game.

190
00:10:04.166 --> 00:10:06.335
I lost, five-zero.

191
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.880
AlphaGo won all the games.

192
00:10:10.548 --> 00:10:13.300
After losing, losing, losing,

193
00:10:13.384 --> 00:10:16.637
you can feel his pressure
is getting heavier and heavier.


194
00:10:17.179 --> 00:10:19.223
And several times after the game,

195
00:10:19.306 --> 00:10:23.519
he said he wanted to
go out for fresh air.

196
00:10:23.602 --> 00:10:25.855
I said, "Oh, I can go with you
and have a chat."


197
00:10:25.938 --> 00:10:27.458
He said, "No, I
want to go by myself."

198
00:10:30.234 --> 00:10:33.112
I felt something very strange.

199
00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:35.072
I lost to a program.

200
00:10:35.781 --> 00:10:39.326
And I didn't understand myself anymore.

201
00:10:43.455 --> 00:10:45.541
I worried whether
he would even come back.


202
00:10:45.624 --> 00:10:48.168
You know, he seemed very low,

203
00:10:48.252 --> 00:10:50.921
and he spent about an hour away
from the office.


204
00:10:51.005 --> 00:10:52.840
He came back completely changed.

205
00:10:52.923 --> 00:10:56.635
I told Maddy,
"This is the first time in history


206
00:10:56.719 --> 00:11:00.723
that a human professional Go player
lost to a program.


207
00:11:01.223 --> 00:11:03.058
She told me, "Yes, we know.

208
00:11:03.142 --> 00:11:06.103
But for you... 
Are you okay?"

209
00:11:06.812 --> 00:11:07.897
I told her...

210
00:11:09.648 --> 00:11:11.775
"No, and yes."

211
00:11:12.443 --> 00:11:15.154
I am not happy to lose a game,

212
00:11:15.613 --> 00:11:19.825
but I'm very happy to play for history.

213
00:11:21.994 --> 00:11:26.165
Artificial intelligence researchers
have solved the game of Go


214
00:11:26.248 --> 00:11:28.626
a decade earlier than expected.

215
00:11:28.709 --> 00:11:30.544
The computer named AlphaGo,

216
00:11:30.628 --> 00:11:33.172
was able to beat
the European human champion.


217
00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:35.132
Artificial intelligence researchers

218
00:11:35.215 --> 00:11:36.925
have made a significant breakthrough.

219
00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:39.094
It really is a big leap forward.

220
00:11:39.553 --> 00:11:44.350
There's a big difference between
the way the IBM computer beat Kasparov,


221
00:11:44.433 --> 00:11:46.977
which was programmed
by expert chess players,


222
00:11:47.061 --> 00:11:50.939
and the way the Go-playing computer,
more or less, learned itself.


223
00:11:51.023 --> 00:11:53.317
The way we start off training AlphaGo

224
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.529
is by showing it 100,000 games
that strong amateurs have played,


225
00:11:57.613 --> 00:11:59.257
that we have downloaded from the Internet.

226
00:11:59.281 --> 00:12:02.910
And we first initially get AlphaGo
to mimic the human player.


227
00:12:02.993 --> 00:12:05.245
And then, through self-playing,
reinforcement learning,


228
00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:08.165
it plays against different versions
of itself many millions of times,


229
00:12:08.248 --> 00:12:09.917
and learns from its errors.

230
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.962
The specific ideas
that are driving AlphaGo


231
00:12:14.046 --> 00:12:15.756
are going to drive our future.

232
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.550
The technologies
at the heart of AlphaGo,


233
00:12:18.634 --> 00:12:20.928
they are what are called
deep neural networks


234
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:22.930
which essentially mimic

235
00:12:23.013 --> 00:12:25.140
the web of neurons in the human brain.

236
00:12:25.224 --> 00:12:26.642
It's a very old idea,

237
00:12:26.725 --> 00:12:30.437
but recently, due to increases
in computing power,


238
00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:33.232
these neural networks
have become extremely powerful,


239
00:12:33.315 --> 00:12:34.191
almost overnight.

240
00:12:34.274 --> 00:12:37.444
Big neural networks
that operate on big data


241
00:12:37.528 --> 00:12:39.446
can achieve surprising things.

242
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.032
AlphaGo found a way to learn
how to play Go.


243
00:12:42.116 --> 00:12:44.952
Learning is the key thing here.
It is a machine learning.


244
00:12:45.035 --> 00:12:47.079
The whole beauty
about these types of algorithms


245
00:12:47.162 --> 00:12:49.057
is that because they are learning
for themselves,


246
00:12:49.081 --> 00:12:49.957
they can go beyond

247
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.960
what we, as the programmers,
know how to do,


248
00:12:53.043 --> 00:12:56.839
and allow us to make new breakthroughs
in areas of science and medicine.


249
00:12:56.922 --> 00:13:01.719
So, AlphaGo is one significant step
towards that ultimate goal.


250
00:13:11.395 --> 00:13:13.063
My wife called me.

251
00:13:13.647 --> 00:13:16.608
She told me, "Don't check the Internet.

252
00:13:16.692 --> 00:13:18.110
Don't connect to the Internet,

253
00:13:18.193 --> 00:13:20.654
because people are saying terrible things

254
00:13:20.738 --> 00:13:22.781
about your match with AlphaGo."

255
00:13:23.282 --> 00:13:26.243
"Fan Hui has been living
for a long time in Europe,


256
00:13:26.326 --> 00:13:28.871
he is not a real professional,
he's just an amateur player."


257
00:13:29.705 --> 00:13:32.416
This is so hard for me, so hard.

258
00:13:34.293 --> 00:13:36.086
The Go world was skeptical

259
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.672
about how strong really was AlphaGo,

260
00:13:38.756 --> 00:13:40.257
and how much further did it need

261
00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.134
to get to beat the top professionals.

262
00:13:42.634 --> 00:13:45.304
So our program is improving over time,

263
00:13:45.387 --> 00:13:48.182
and we want to push
the AI algorithm to the limit,


264
00:13:48.265 --> 00:13:51.852
and see how far this kind
of self-improving process can go.


265
00:13:52.603 --> 00:13:55.481
So, we needed to look
for an even greater challenge.


266
00:13:56.732 --> 00:14:00.360
A match like no other
is about to get underway in South Korea.


267
00:14:00.444 --> 00:14:02.654
Se-dol Lee,
the long-reigning global champ...


268
00:14:02.738 --> 00:14:04.239
This guy is a genius...

269
00:14:04.323 --> 00:14:07.743
...who will take on
artificial intelligence program AlphaGo


270
00:14:07.826 --> 00:14:10.871
in the ultimate
human versus machine smackdown.


271
00:14:10.954 --> 00:14:14.917
This is a huge moment for both
the world of artificial intelligence


272
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.085
and I think, the world of Go.

273
00:14:17.169 --> 00:14:20.839
So far, AlphaGo has beaten
every challenge we have given it.


274
00:14:20.923 --> 00:14:23.967
But we won't know
its true strength until we play somebody


275
00:14:24.051 --> 00:14:26.970
who is at the top of the world,
like Se-dol Lee.


276
00:14:27.054 --> 00:14:28.514
We chose Se-dol Lee

277
00:14:28.597 --> 00:14:32.142
because we wanted
a legendary, historic player.


278
00:14:32.226 --> 00:14:36.021
Somebody who has been acknowledged
as the greatest player of the last decade.


279
00:14:36.438 --> 00:14:40.400
I don't want to sound too arrogant,

280
00:14:40.484 --> 00:14:42.528
but, still, I think I have the advantage.

281
00:14:42.611 --> 00:14:44.738
"I will not be too arrogant,

282
00:14:44.822 --> 00:14:48.033
but I don't think
that it will be a very close match.


283
00:14:48.117 --> 00:14:52.538
The level of the player that AlphaGo
went against in October


284
00:14:52.621 --> 00:14:54.123
is not the same level as me.

285
00:14:54.206 --> 00:14:57.626
So, given that a couple of months
has only passed,


286
00:14:57.709 --> 00:15:01.463
I don't think that it is enough for it
to be able to catch up with me.


287
00:15:01.547 --> 00:15:06.552
My hope is that it will be either
five-zero for me, or maybe four to one.


288
00:15:06.635 --> 00:15:10.430
So the critical point for me
is to make sure I do not lose one."


289
00:15:11.014 --> 00:15:12.641
High five, please.

290
00:15:13.642 --> 00:15:15.727
We don't know how well

291
00:15:15.811 --> 00:15:17.521
our system will play against someone

292
00:15:17.604 --> 00:15:19.648
as creative as Se-dol Lee.

293
00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:20.816
Also, he's very famous

294
00:15:20.899 --> 00:15:24.278
- for very creative fighting play.
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.


295
00:15:24.361 --> 00:15:27.531
So, this could be difficult for us,
but we'll see.


296
00:15:27.614 --> 00:15:28.448
Maybe, in some ways,

297
00:15:28.532 --> 00:15:30.372
he's the most difficult opponent
we could pick.


298
00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:31.285
Yeah.

299
00:15:31.368 --> 00:15:33.787
There was still so much
of a question


300
00:15:33.871 --> 00:15:35.873
about whether or not they could beat

301
00:15:35.956 --> 00:15:37.791
someone like Se-dol Lee.

302
00:15:38.292 --> 00:15:39.668
Fan Hui is a good player,

303
00:15:39.751 --> 00:15:42.880
but he's nothing
like the very top players.


304
00:15:42.963 --> 00:15:45.132
Se-dol Lee
is a 9-dan professional.


305
00:15:45.424 --> 00:15:48.969
Nine-dan professional is the highest rank
that you can achieve in Go.


306
00:15:49.052 --> 00:15:50.470
The ranking system.

307
00:15:50.554 --> 00:15:54.391
Fan Hui, who is the European Champion,
is just a 2-dan professional.


308
00:15:54.474 --> 00:15:59.021
On the other hand, at the very top,
Se-dol Lee is a 9-dan professional.


309
00:15:59.104 --> 00:16:01.857
Se-dol Lee is to Go
what Roger Federer is to tennis.


310
00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.109
He is playing in Wimbledon
to win the Grand Slam.


311
00:16:04.193 --> 00:16:06.254
And it's not just this year.
He'll be there next year,


312
00:16:06.278 --> 00:16:08.488
and the year after that,
and the year after that.


313
00:16:08.572 --> 00:16:10.532
Of course, the Internet,

314
00:16:10.616 --> 00:16:14.077
and all the Go community, everyone,

315
00:16:15.162 --> 00:16:19.541
maybe not 100%, maybe 99.999%

316
00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:23.170
think Se-dol Lee will win very easily.

317
00:16:23.795 --> 00:16:26.215
Teacher, I got stuck.

318
00:16:26.298 --> 00:16:27.591
How do I go from here?

319
00:16:30.093 --> 00:16:31.845
Good.
Hold the stone properly.


320
00:16:31.929 --> 00:16:34.556
Place the stone nicely, not like that.

321
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.642
And hold it nicely, like this.

322
00:16:37.976 --> 00:16:39.895
Go is taken seriously in Korea.

323
00:16:40.187 --> 00:16:43.440
It's so much part of the culture,
like breathing, or, you know,


324
00:16:43.523 --> 00:16:46.026
like taking swimming lessons,
or something.


325
00:16:46.735 --> 00:16:48.362
On the surface, it's a game,

326
00:16:48.445 --> 00:16:51.990
but inside, it has a very deep philosophy.

327
00:16:52.074 --> 00:16:55.744
The Go board reflects
the individual who's playing.


328
00:16:55.827 --> 00:16:58.121
The truth is going to show itself
on the board.


329
00:16:58.205 --> 00:16:59.790
You won't be able to hide it.

330
00:17:00.666 --> 00:17:03.919
In ancient China, Japan, Korea,

331
00:17:04.002 --> 00:17:07.923
Go is one of the four noble things,

332
00:17:08.006 --> 00:17:11.093
like four accomplishments for literati,

333
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:15.264
with music, poetry, and painting.

334
00:17:15.347 --> 00:17:18.976
So, people think the Go players

335
00:17:19.059 --> 00:17:21.645
are very smart and very noble.

336
00:17:21.728 --> 00:17:23.063
It's okay to lose,

337
00:17:23.146 --> 00:17:24.415
as long as you played your best.

338
00:17:24.439 --> 00:17:27.109
Bow to your opponent.

339
00:17:27.192 --> 00:17:29.569
Master Kwon started this school,

340
00:17:29.653 --> 00:17:31.488
so that he could produce

341
00:17:31.571 --> 00:17:33.115
great players in Korea.

342
00:17:33.657 --> 00:17:36.410
Se-dol Lee, when he was eight years old,

343
00:17:36.493 --> 00:17:38.787
he came in here, attending class,

344
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:42.040
9:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m.
for seven days.


345
00:17:42.124 --> 00:17:44.293
And then, he stayed with Master Kwon.

346
00:17:45.127 --> 00:17:47.254
I remember his round face

347
00:17:47.337 --> 00:17:49.589
and dark brown eyes.

348
00:17:50.215 --> 00:17:54.845
Since he came
from an island, he easily drew attention.


349
00:17:55.345 --> 00:17:59.141
But unlike the other children,

350
00:17:59.224 --> 00:18:01.893
his eyes shone brightly.

351
00:18:01.977 --> 00:18:02.977
7TH WORLD GO CHAMPIONSHIP

352
00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.522
Se-dol Lee was a little boy

353
00:18:05.605 --> 00:18:09.067
that I remember when I was a student
studying Go.


354
00:18:09.151 --> 00:18:14.573
He was very young and rural enough
to think that pizza grew on trees.


355
00:18:16.074 --> 00:18:17.576
When I was young,

356
00:18:17.659 --> 00:18:20.078
I started playing Go
because I thought it was fun


357
00:18:20.162 --> 00:18:21.830
to beat guys who were older than me.

358
00:18:21.913 --> 00:18:25.375
Since then, it has become
a type of creation of mine.


359
00:18:25.917 --> 00:18:28.086
I want my style of Go
to be something different,


360
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:29.379
something new,

361
00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.049
my own thing.

362
00:18:33.884 --> 00:18:36.261
Something that no one
has thought of before.


363
00:18:36.845 --> 00:18:38.972
Se-dol Lee plays things

364
00:18:39.056 --> 00:18:41.725
that are interesting, where you felt like

365
00:18:41.808 --> 00:18:43.185
he is beyond winning and losing.

366
00:18:43.268 --> 00:18:47.230
He wants to do something that's innovative
or takes things to the next level.


367
00:18:47.314 --> 00:18:49.858
So every Go player
studies his game for sure.


368
00:18:49.941 --> 00:18:51.151
21ST ASIAN TV CUP CHAMPIONSHIP

369
00:18:51.234 --> 00:18:54.029
Roughly for ten years, he dominated
the professional Go world.


370
00:18:54.112 --> 00:18:56.198
He won 18 World Championships.

371
00:18:56.281 --> 00:18:57.532
Se-dol Lee

372
00:18:57.616 --> 00:18:59.284
is a genius of the century.

373
00:18:59.368 --> 00:19:01.679
2012 GO CHAMPIONSHIP AWARD CEREMONY
AT GRAND CENTRAL HOTEL, CHINA


374
00:19:01.703 --> 00:19:05.624
Even when I look back now,
I am proud of him.


375
00:19:05.707 --> 00:19:08.752
And I'm proud of myself, too.

376
00:19:09.378 --> 00:19:12.172
Definitely, Se-dol Lee
is going to win the game, five all.


377
00:19:12.255 --> 00:19:13.655
IF YOU DESIRE TO WIN, YOU WILL LOSE

378
00:19:14.383 --> 00:19:15.801
Yeah, all the games.

379
00:19:16.343 --> 00:19:17.761
He's going to win all the games.

380
00:19:18.929 --> 00:19:21.598
We had our evaluation match
last week.


381
00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:23.809
We won a game,
and we lost a game.

382
00:19:23.892 --> 00:19:25.018
And we lost a game in a way

383
00:19:25.102 --> 00:19:26.746
that would have made us look
extremely foolish


384
00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:28.355
if that happened publicly.

385
00:19:29.147 --> 00:19:31.358
It means that we
still have work to do,

386
00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:33.086
and we need to take this really seriously.

387
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.445
There's just too much risk that, actually,

388
00:19:35.529 --> 00:19:38.156
we could lose, overall.

389
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.868
Not only that, but we could lose in a way
that makes us look rather silly.


390
00:19:41.952 --> 00:19:43.537
- Yeah.
- So, I guess, um...


391
00:19:44.079 --> 00:19:46.474
Yeah, Aja, did you want to say anything
about what you're trying?


392
00:19:46.498 --> 00:19:47.874
I'm working hard.

393
00:19:51.586 --> 00:19:53.547
So, we're working round the clock
at the moment,


394
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:55.257
training our algorithms further,

395
00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.342
trying to incrementally keep on improving

396
00:19:57.426 --> 00:19:59.678
right up to the moment
where we have the match.


397
00:19:59.761 --> 00:20:01.096
We have collected together

398
00:20:01.179 --> 00:20:03.682
people with different skill sets
onto the same team.


399
00:20:03.765 --> 00:20:07.686
So we have researchers,
engineers, valuation guys.


400
00:20:08.061 --> 00:20:10.039
But you mean what happens
if that creates something new


401
00:20:10.063 --> 00:20:11.731
- which wasn't in heavy node?
- Yeah.


402
00:20:12.274 --> 00:20:13.358
Then we don't see it.

403
00:20:13.442 --> 00:20:14.484
You'll see it.

404
00:20:14.568 --> 00:20:16.027
- Okay.
- The first thing to know...


405
00:20:16.111 --> 00:20:17.713
I was thinking
we have the perfect solution,


406
00:20:17.737 --> 00:20:19.448
- but it's not perfect.
- Yeah.


407
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:24.661
Aja is the lead programmer,
and built the original search engine.


408
00:20:24.744 --> 00:20:26.746
So Aja's responsibility
is quite a big one.


409
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.374
He'll be the one sitting
opposite Se-dol Lee


410
00:20:29.458 --> 00:20:32.836
and actually playing
the moves AlphaGo makes.


411
00:20:32.919 --> 00:20:34.921
- I'm feeling excited.
- Yeah?


412
00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:38.925
Se-dol Lee is a great player,

413
00:20:39.009 --> 00:20:42.429
and I feel honored to play with him.

414
00:20:43.096 --> 00:20:45.765
Many of my friends,
they are very excited about the match.


415
00:20:45.849 --> 00:20:49.144
They keep telling me
that the whole world is watching.


416
00:20:49.227 --> 00:20:51.313
"Just prepare AlphaGo."

417
00:20:51.771 --> 00:20:52.772
Hello.

418
00:20:52.856 --> 00:20:54.357
Hello, Demis. Can you hear us?

419
00:20:54.441 --> 00:20:55.734
Yes, I can hear you, guys.

420
00:20:55.817 --> 00:20:57.319
Can you hear me okay?

421
00:20:57.402 --> 00:20:58.737
Yes. Perfect.

422
00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.780
"I was curious to meet you,

423
00:21:00.864 --> 00:21:03.033
such an amazing developer

424
00:21:03.116 --> 00:21:05.076
who made AlphaGo.

425
00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.536
It's very nice to meet you."

426
00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.039
Thank you, thank you. Likewise.

427
00:21:09.122 --> 00:21:11.625
It's a real pleasure to meet you.

428
00:21:11.708 --> 00:21:14.377
I love the game of Go. 
I'm not very good,

429
00:21:14.461 --> 00:21:17.005
but I don't know if you know,

430
00:21:17.088 --> 00:21:19.341
but we actually have something in common.

431
00:21:19.424 --> 00:21:22.802
I actually also trained at a game
at a young age.


432
00:21:22.886 --> 00:21:25.972
I used to be, when I was young,
a professional chess player.


433
00:21:26.056 --> 00:21:27.974
He said that he was once

434
00:21:28.058 --> 00:21:29.118
a professional chess player.

435
00:21:29.142 --> 00:21:32.312
I used to play for the England team,

436
00:21:32.395 --> 00:21:36.316
and then I stopped playing
when I was about 14. I was...


437
00:21:36.399 --> 00:21:39.736
When I was 13, I was the second
highest-rated player in the world.


438
00:21:39.819 --> 00:21:41.154
"After the match,

439
00:21:41.238 --> 00:21:44.991
I would like to propose
that I give you one teaching game of Go,


440
00:21:45.075 --> 00:21:47.577
and you give me
one teaching game of chess."


441
00:21:47.661 --> 00:21:49.204
- Yeah.
- "How does that sound?"


442
00:21:49.287 --> 00:21:52.791
That sounds very good.
I would be very honored to do that.


443
00:21:52.874 --> 00:21:56.753
"I'm not sure if it's okay
to ask you this question,


444
00:21:56.836 --> 00:21:59.422
but I saw the games against Fan Hui,

445
00:21:59.506 --> 00:22:03.677
and I didn't think it was quite
at the level to play with me,


446
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.930
but I heard
that it is getting really stronger.


447
00:22:07.013 --> 00:22:10.517
Can I ask how much
it got stronger since then?"


448
00:22:13.603 --> 00:22:16.815
Yeah. I can't say too much, of course,

449
00:22:16.898 --> 00:22:20.402
but it's definitely got
significantly stronger.


450
00:22:21.987 --> 00:22:24.948
With more time,
I think, a logical approach


451
00:22:25.031 --> 00:22:28.159
would be to follow up
on Aja's local search,


452
00:22:28.243 --> 00:22:29.995
- run that fast in AlphaGo,
- Right.


453
00:22:30.078 --> 00:22:31.555
- generate a whole new data set,
- Exactly.


454
00:22:31.579 --> 00:22:33.248
- and iterate more time.
- Yeah.


455
00:22:33.331 --> 00:22:36.042
But we're just out of time for that,
so we have to be realistic.


456
00:22:36.126 --> 00:22:38.878
We realized that
if we wanted to prepare


457
00:22:38.962 --> 00:22:42.299
for a mammoth task
like taking on Se-dol Lee,


458
00:22:42.382 --> 00:22:45.635
there would be nothing better
than talking to a professional.


459
00:22:45.719 --> 00:22:48.430
And we couldn't have picked
a better person than Fan Hui.


460
00:22:51.891 --> 00:22:54.561
We invited him as an advisor

461
00:22:54.644 --> 00:22:58.356
because during the match,
we realized he is a man of good spirit.


462
00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.191
- Welcome back.
- Thank you very much.


463
00:23:00.275 --> 00:23:02.736
It's very precious
that we have Fan Hui with us.


464
00:23:02.819 --> 00:23:03.987
Let's go down this way.

465
00:23:05.613 --> 00:23:07.532
He was crushed by AlphaGo,

466
00:23:07.615 --> 00:23:09.284
but then, he became very positive

467
00:23:09.367 --> 00:23:11.077
and was a big help to us.

468
00:23:12.203 --> 00:23:13.496
When Demis told me,

469
00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.791
"Can you come back to help us
make AlphaGo stronger?"


470
00:23:17.876 --> 00:23:19.419
I felt a sense of respect.

471
00:23:20.253 --> 00:23:22.255
Of course, I accepted it.

472
00:23:24.382 --> 00:23:26.259
I played with AlphaGo

473
00:23:26.343 --> 00:23:30.430
to understand
what AlphaGo's strong points are


474
00:23:30.513 --> 00:23:33.641
and what may be its weakness.

475
00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:35.769
I played in the morning,

476
00:23:36.353 --> 00:23:37.437
in the afternoon,

477
00:23:38.563 --> 00:23:39.563
all the time.

478
00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.525
And I found something.

479
00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:46.488
I found AlphaGo's big weakness.

480
00:23:47.155 --> 00:23:48.365
It was a big one.

481
00:23:49.157 --> 00:23:50.575
The superheroes always have

482
00:23:50.658 --> 00:23:52.619
a hidden vulnerability, right?

483
00:23:52.702 --> 00:23:54.996
And the same is true for AlphaGo.

484
00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:59.376
It's unbelievably superhuman, in general,

485
00:23:59.459 --> 00:24:03.338
but it has some particular weaknesses
in some situations.


486
00:24:03.421 --> 00:24:05.048
We can think of there
being this space


487
00:24:05.131 --> 00:24:06.508
of all the things it knows about,

488
00:24:06.591 --> 00:24:08.802
and it knows about most of it
extremely well.


489
00:24:08.885 --> 00:24:11.346
Then there will be these tricky lumps
of knowledge,


490
00:24:11.429 --> 00:24:14.140
that it just understands very poorly.

491
00:24:14.224 --> 00:24:16.309
And it's really hard for us
to characterize


492
00:24:16.393 --> 00:24:18.436
when it is going to enter
into one of these lumps.


493
00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.772
But if it does,
it can be completely delusional,


494
00:24:20.855 --> 00:24:22.750
thinking that it is alive
on one part of the board


495
00:24:22.774 --> 00:24:24.776
when, in fact, it's dead or vice versa.

496
00:24:25.235 --> 00:24:27.946
So, there is a real risk
that we could lose the match.


497
00:24:29.114 --> 00:24:30.782
Everybody in the team

498
00:24:30.865 --> 00:24:33.743
tried to work more and more
to fix the problem,


499
00:24:33.827 --> 00:24:36.204
but I thought it was difficult

500
00:24:36.287 --> 00:24:38.164
for it to be fixed very quickly.

501
00:24:38.248 --> 00:24:40.750
We've got version 18
in the pipeline, haven't we?


502
00:24:41.292 --> 00:24:43.172
Well, we will only go
for version 18 if it makes


503
00:24:43.253 --> 00:24:45.338
- a significant improvement which...
- If it... Yes.


504
00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.342
We're having to rerun all the tests
because they went wrong, unfortunately,


505
00:24:49.426 --> 00:24:53.012
so we're basically a day behind
in our evaluation because of that.


506
00:24:53.555 --> 00:24:55.306
Well, maybe we just need
to be realistic.


507
00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.142
That we've tried a bunch of things,

508
00:24:57.225 --> 00:24:59.545
and we've come to the point
where we said we would actually


509
00:24:59.602 --> 00:25:02.397
start freezing the code, and saying,

510
00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.523
"Look, it's...

511
00:25:04.649 --> 00:25:06.860
not... actually, not panning out."

512
00:25:07.277 --> 00:25:11.072
These delusions are still
a realistic possibility for the match.


513
00:25:11.156 --> 00:25:12.740
We have some weaknesses

514
00:25:12.824 --> 00:25:17.495
that we... I don't think we are going
to fix fully before the match,


515
00:25:17.579 --> 00:25:20.748
so that's causing us
a little bit of anxiety.


516
00:25:26.671 --> 00:25:29.424
Se-dol Lee is getting ready to rumble.

517
00:25:29.507 --> 00:25:31.676
On Wednesday, live across the Internet,

518
00:25:31.759 --> 00:25:34.095
this professional South Korean Go player

519
00:25:34.179 --> 00:25:37.432
will take on artificial intelligence
program AlphaGo.


520
00:25:37.515 --> 00:25:42.479
I am confident
that I will win five to zero.


521
00:25:43.688 --> 00:25:46.733
Tomorrow, Julian and George,
they pack up version 18,


522
00:25:46.816 --> 00:25:49.277
they stick it on a laptop,
and they fly out to Seoul.


523
00:25:53.531 --> 00:25:55.033
- See you all in Korea.
- Safe trip.


524
00:25:55.116 --> 00:25:56.476
- Have a safe trip.
- See you, too.


525
00:26:08.213 --> 00:26:11.674
Is everything all set
for the victory against Se-dol Lee?


526
00:26:11.758 --> 00:26:12.842
Everything is set, I think.

527
00:26:12.926 --> 00:26:15.845
But when I get to the hotel,
I'm going to catch up with the team.


528
00:26:15.929 --> 00:26:17.597
What we should do
in the time remaining


529
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.809
is list things that could go wrong
in the solidity of the system.


530
00:26:21.893 --> 00:26:25.271
We need somewhere
to put AlphaGo under here.


531
00:26:25.355 --> 00:26:27.607
All right, rehearsal.
Let's go, please, folks!


532
00:26:28.233 --> 00:26:29.609
Have you arranged the place

533
00:26:29.692 --> 00:26:31.152
for Se-dol Lee to smoke?

534
00:26:31.236 --> 00:26:33.396
When he is in a difficult situation,
he likes to smoke.


535
00:26:33.446 --> 00:26:36.074
Yes, there is a terrace,
and we will have security,


536
00:26:36.157 --> 00:26:38.243
so he will be able to go up there
and be by himself.


537
00:26:38.326 --> 00:26:40.578
Which one do you support,

538
00:26:40.662 --> 00:26:42.372
Se-dol Lee or AlphaGo?

539
00:26:43.498 --> 00:26:45.083
I am in an awkward position.

540
00:26:45.166 --> 00:26:47.085
- As you can see, I am a referee.
- I see.


541
00:26:47.168 --> 00:26:48.419
I am a referee.

542
00:26:49.671 --> 00:26:50.922
When I got here,

543
00:26:51.005 --> 00:26:52.715
I didn't expect
the attention on the match.


544
00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:54.717
It was literally front-page news.

545
00:26:54.801 --> 00:26:58.096
About eight million Koreans
play the game of Go,


546
00:26:58.179 --> 00:27:00.682
and, even those who don't,
you know, recognize Se-dol Lee.


547
00:27:00.765 --> 00:27:02.267
He is a national figure.

548
00:27:02.934 --> 00:27:04.185
And so, there's that. Right?

549
00:27:04.269 --> 00:27:05.812
There's some national pride involved.

550
00:27:05.895 --> 00:27:07.397
But, it's more than that.

551
00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:11.943
Just the very thought of a machine
playing a human in something like this,


552
00:27:12.026 --> 00:27:14.112
I think, is inherently intriguing
to people.


553
00:27:15.113 --> 00:27:16.364
We can bring him in?

554
00:27:17.198 --> 00:27:18.449
Let's go in? Yes.

555
00:27:29.252 --> 00:27:31.713
I am confident about the match.

556
00:27:31.796 --> 00:27:36.217
I believe that human intuition
is still too advanced


557
00:27:37.093 --> 00:27:41.055
for AI to have caught up.

558
00:27:41.556 --> 00:27:45.977
I'm going to do my best
to protect human intelligence.


559
00:27:47.729 --> 00:27:50.064
The whole world put pressure

560
00:27:50.148 --> 00:27:51.316
to Se-dol Lee.

561
00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:56.321
Before this, he played the tournament
for his country, for himself.


562
00:27:56.904 --> 00:27:59.157
But this time,
he's playing for the human race.


563
00:28:08.166 --> 00:28:10.126
I just really hope we win
this first game.


564
00:28:10.209 --> 00:28:11.270
If you lose the first game,

565
00:28:11.294 --> 00:28:12.938
you literally have to win
three out of four.


566
00:28:12.962 --> 00:28:13.962
Yeah, that's right.

567
00:28:14.005 --> 00:28:15.506
- Which is hard work.
- Yeah.


568
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:16.630
Where are you going to be?

569
00:28:16.674 --> 00:28:18.068
- I'll start in the match room.
- Okay.


570
00:28:18.092 --> 00:28:20.154
Then, I'm gonna come in here,
make sure everything's fine.


571
00:28:20.178 --> 00:28:22.738
- Yeah, you should probably be in here.
- Or something like that.


572
00:28:25.975 --> 00:28:28.269
- I know you're nervous.
- Yeah, I'm nervous.


573
00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.104
I'm nervous.

574
00:28:31.564 --> 00:28:32.833
How are you? You're not nervous?

575
00:28:32.857 --> 00:28:34.442
- A bit.
- Little bit, yeah?


576
00:28:34.525 --> 00:28:36.319
It's good to have
a little bit of nerves.

577
00:28:38.363 --> 00:28:40.365
It should be fine.

578
00:28:41.449 --> 00:28:42.700
Be fine. Be fine.

579
00:28:43.201 --> 00:28:46.663
Hello, and welcome
to the DeepMind Challenge,


580
00:28:46.746 --> 00:28:48.915
Game One, Round One,

581
00:28:48.998 --> 00:28:52.502
live from the Four Seasons
here in Seoul, Korea.


582
00:28:52.585 --> 00:28:55.463
I'm Chris Garlock
of The American Go E-Journal.


583
00:28:55.546 --> 00:28:58.675
I'm here with Michael Redmond,

584
00:28:58.758 --> 00:28:59.758
Welcome, Michael.

585
00:28:59.801 --> 00:29:03.930
Want to give a shout-out to all the folks
watching around the world?


586
00:29:04.013 --> 00:29:06.683
Well, the excitement
is pretty palpable here in the hotel.


587
00:29:06.766 --> 00:29:10.436
I've never seen a crush of interest
of reporters from around the world.


588
00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.280
- The cameras...
- The media is overwhelming.


589
00:29:12.355 --> 00:29:14.148
I am not sure how much AlphaGo

590
00:29:14.232 --> 00:29:17.944
has changed in the last five months.

591
00:29:18.027 --> 00:29:20.446
All right, folks. You're here,
you're gonna see history made.


592
00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:21.530
Stay with us.

593
00:29:21.698 --> 00:29:24.492
Five minutes, guys. Five minutes.

594
00:29:30.081 --> 00:29:32.875
Please don't push.

595
00:29:32.959 --> 00:29:34.502
I just thought we should

596
00:29:34.585 --> 00:29:40.049
take a moment together and just think
about what is about to happen.


597
00:29:40.133 --> 00:29:41.718
I'm extremely excited to be here.

598
00:29:41.801 --> 00:29:44.804
Extremely proud of every one of you
and what we have done.


599
00:29:44.887 --> 00:29:47.390
And, win or loss, I think
it is just amazing that we're here.


600
00:29:47.473 --> 00:29:49.851
Isn't it strange your dad

601
00:29:49.934 --> 00:29:51.134
is fighting against a machine?

602
00:29:52.603 --> 00:29:55.106
I would like it if the machine

603
00:29:55.189 --> 00:29:57.025
did not beat a human in Go yet.

604
00:29:59.235 --> 00:30:00.403
One minute left.

605
00:30:45.406 --> 00:30:48.534
Five, four, three, two, one.

606
00:30:54.207 --> 00:30:55.666
The match will be

607
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.919
in Chinese rules, 7.5 points komi.

608
00:30:58.211 --> 00:31:01.422
The time limit is two hours,
and 60 seconds times three.


609
00:31:24.362 --> 00:31:26.072
Please choose the stone.

610
00:31:27.406 --> 00:31:29.492
Se-dol Lee, 9 dan, what have you chosen?

611
00:31:30.785 --> 00:31:31.785
Black.

612
00:31:32.578 --> 00:31:34.372
Please start the game.

613
00:31:59.272 --> 00:32:00.773
We had worked so hard

614
00:32:00.857 --> 00:32:04.610
to make sure that this would go
technically smoothly.


615
00:32:04.986 --> 00:32:07.572
We tested it and
tested it and tested it.

616
00:32:08.239 --> 00:32:12.869
And still, there comes that moment
when you're live,


617
00:32:12.952 --> 00:32:16.080
all the TV cameras
are broadcasting everything,


618
00:32:16.164 --> 00:32:19.292
and now it has to do
the thing you built it to do.


619
00:32:20.751 --> 00:32:22.962
AlphaGo is even considering

620
00:32:23.045 --> 00:32:24.547
what to do from the first step.

621
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:26.716
If you look at the time closely,

622
00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:28.193
- it has been over 30 seconds.
- Yes.


623
00:32:28.217 --> 00:32:30.386
AlphaGo is thinking too long
at the second move.


624
00:32:30.469 --> 00:32:31.469
Yes.

625
00:33:08.925 --> 00:33:10.593
I was a bit nervous.

626
00:33:10.676 --> 00:33:15.765
It's the first time that I sat
in front of a world-class Go player.


627
00:33:16.599 --> 00:33:19.810
And I actually felt
the spirit and courtesy


628
00:33:19.894 --> 00:33:22.480
of a great Go player like Se-dol Lee.

629
00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.900
Because I think
it was the first time he faced


630
00:33:25.983 --> 00:33:27.693
a strange opponent, I think.

631
00:33:27.777 --> 00:33:31.197
It is non-human,
has no emotion, it's cold.


632
00:33:31.739 --> 00:33:33.741
But he stayed very calm.

633
00:33:34.325 --> 00:33:37.662
And I can feel his mental strength.

634
00:33:51.133 --> 00:33:52.176
Oh.

635
00:33:52.301 --> 00:33:53.803
AlphaGo peeped.

636
00:33:54.845 --> 00:33:56.931
It's unbelievable.

637
00:33:57.723 --> 00:34:00.059
This is the first time

638
00:34:00.142 --> 00:34:01.978
I am seeing AlphaGo
making a move like this.


639
00:34:02.061 --> 00:34:04.647
It feels like AlphaGo is playing
like a human.


640
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:05.856
I'm Andrew Jackson.

641
00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:09.527
With me here is Myung-wan Kim, a 9-dan pro
from the Korean Baduk Association.


642
00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:12.029
We are here live
at the Four Seasons Hotel

643
00:34:12.113 --> 00:34:13.197
on the 21st floor.

644
00:34:13.406 --> 00:34:15.366
What are we looking at?
How's the game going?


645
00:34:16.617 --> 00:34:18.577
Oh, it's fighting from the beginning.

646
00:34:18.661 --> 00:34:20.746
- From the very beginning?
- Yeah, yeah.


647
00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.249
- AlphaGo is playing very well.
- Yeah?


648
00:34:23.332 --> 00:34:26.711
- It's just like a top professional.
- Just like a top professional?


649
00:34:26.794 --> 00:34:28.546
Yeah, it's very aggressive.

650
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:31.966
- It blocked!
- Did it block?


651
00:34:32.967 --> 00:34:35.011
How dare he disconnect it?

652
00:34:35.678 --> 00:34:38.139
This can't be right.

653
00:34:38.222 --> 00:34:40.433
Now, the fight is getting
really complicated.


654
00:34:40.516 --> 00:34:43.602
Um, this is actually the first time
I have seen AlphaGo


655
00:34:44.228 --> 00:34:47.565
playing a game
that has this difficult fight.


656
00:34:52.278 --> 00:34:53.696
This could make

657
00:34:53.779 --> 00:34:55.114
Se-dol Lee nervous.

658
00:34:55.573 --> 00:34:58.451
Because AlphaGo uses one minute
to 1.5 minutes in any situation.


659
00:34:59.243 --> 00:35:02.788
This action is not
like a human at all.

660
00:35:03.789 --> 00:35:05.750
No matter how complex you make the game,

661
00:35:05.833 --> 00:35:07.713
AlphaGo plays as if it knows
everything already.


662
00:35:10.129 --> 00:35:12.465
I just saw him looking
at his opponent's face.


663
00:35:12.715 --> 00:35:15.593
- And that's just kind of a habit.
- It's just an instinct,


664
00:35:15.801 --> 00:35:17.779
as a player, to look at the person
across from you.


665
00:35:17.803 --> 00:35:21.891
Yeah, it's sort of something
that Se-dol Lee would do


666
00:35:21.974 --> 00:35:24.101
when he was wondering
how his opponent was feeling.


667
00:35:24.185 --> 00:35:26.187
- Right.
- It's just a habit.


668
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:29.774
So, it's not as if Aja Huang
is going to do any giveaway


669
00:35:29.857 --> 00:35:32.735
- because Aja Huang isn't AlphaGo, right?
- Right. Right.


670
00:35:41.702 --> 00:35:42.912
He almost made a move.

671
00:35:42.995 --> 00:35:44.663
Lee smiled for a second.

672
00:35:44.747 --> 00:35:46.957
- No. That's...
- I guess Lee is mistaken?


673
00:35:47.041 --> 00:35:49.210
He was about to make a move
that makes no sense.


674
00:35:49.293 --> 00:35:51.295
- Here is the...
- What is he doing?


675
00:35:52.505 --> 00:35:54.816
If he had put his stone there,
he would have lost the game today.


676
00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.635
- He was trying to place it here,
- His hand...


677
00:35:57.718 --> 00:35:59.595
but he moved his hand there
without thinking.


678
00:35:59.678 --> 00:36:01.931
- He has so many things to ponder.
- Well, I think...


679
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:04.975
He is exhausted now.

680
00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:06.644
- I think...
- Well...


681
00:36:07.561 --> 00:36:08.813
He looks a little panicked.

682
00:36:10.648 --> 00:36:13.818
This is the thing
we were most afraid of.


683
00:36:13.901 --> 00:36:14.901
Yes.

684
00:36:14.944 --> 00:36:16.529
- Self-doubt.
- Self-doubt.


685
00:36:28.749 --> 00:36:30.376
With a human, when you play,

686
00:36:30.459 --> 00:36:32.753
you can have an exchange, by feeling.

687
00:36:33.379 --> 00:36:37.216
I look at you. I know that, okay,
maybe you want to talk with me.


688
00:36:37.633 --> 00:36:39.218
Maybe you fear me.

689
00:36:39.301 --> 00:36:41.011
I can feel many, many things.

690
00:36:41.095 --> 00:36:43.889
But with AlphaGo, you can feel nothing.

691
00:36:45.307 --> 00:36:48.144
So, when you feel nothing when you play,

692
00:36:48.227 --> 00:36:51.021
you have more questions to yourself.

693
00:36:51.647 --> 00:36:53.816
In the beginning, you think,
"Okay, my move was good.


694
00:36:53.899 --> 00:36:56.819
Is it really good? Really good?

695
00:36:57.153 --> 00:36:58.154
Oh, maybe it's bad.

696
00:36:58.237 --> 00:36:59.488
Oh, terrible!

697
00:36:59.572 --> 00:37:00.906
Why did I put it here?"

698
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:02.116
More and more.

699
00:37:03.159 --> 00:37:04.493
It's hard to know where to be.

700
00:37:04.577 --> 00:37:06.847
All the different rooms
are like exciting in different ways.


701
00:37:06.871 --> 00:37:08.539
Mm-hm. Right.

702
00:37:08.622 --> 00:37:11.375
It's quite nice to be here
at the heart of the operation.


703
00:37:11.459 --> 00:37:13.043
Yeah, I feel safe here.

704
00:37:15.129 --> 00:37:17.173
White is thinking of doing
this huge invasion here


705
00:37:17.256 --> 00:37:18.299
from its thick wall.

706
00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:20.384
Yes, go for it.

707
00:37:21.135 --> 00:37:23.304
Stone in. He's going in.

708
00:37:23.721 --> 00:37:25.481
- Look at his face. Look at his face.
- Yeah.


709
00:37:27.183 --> 00:37:28.684
That is not a confident face.

710
00:37:29.059 --> 00:37:31.312
He's pretty horrified by that.

711
00:37:31.854 --> 00:37:34.440
I can't believe
what I'm seeing right now.


712
00:37:34.523 --> 00:37:35.733
Really...

713
00:37:36.192 --> 00:37:39.528
- Se-dol, he's a little bit behind.
- Mm-hm.


714
00:37:39.612 --> 00:37:41.822
- And he made a very aggressive move here.
- Okay.


715
00:37:41.906 --> 00:37:43.282
And made it very complicated.

716
00:37:43.365 --> 00:37:45.034
- Okay.
- I think Se-dol Lee,


717
00:37:45.117 --> 00:37:47.536
- if he doesn't respond correctly,
- Uh-huh.


718
00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.497
then he can collapse.

719
00:37:51.207 --> 00:37:55.336
I mean, this is kind of unthinkable
as a human Go player.


720
00:37:55.794 --> 00:37:57.671
What if it knows everything

721
00:37:57.755 --> 00:37:59.423
about what's going to happen next?

722
00:37:59.507 --> 00:38:00.424
Where are we?

723
00:38:00.508 --> 00:38:04.762
Here's our search depth,
we're searching, 50 or 60 moves ahead.


724
00:38:05.304 --> 00:38:07.598
That's the maximum number
of moves ahead


725
00:38:07.681 --> 00:38:11.101
that AlphaGo is looking
from the current game position.


726
00:38:11.185 --> 00:38:15.439
It's typically over 50.
It's often over 60.


727
00:38:16.273 --> 00:38:19.860
In the games we have seen,
often around move 150,


728
00:38:19.944 --> 00:38:21.445
AlphaGo goes for the kill.

729
00:38:21.529 --> 00:38:24.949
We are at move 150 now,
so we are getting to that tactical point.


730
00:38:28.577 --> 00:38:30.287
We are all astonished,

731
00:38:30.955 --> 00:38:35.584
just in the middle of the game
because AlphaGo is, uh...


732
00:38:35.668 --> 00:38:39.171
It seems to be doing a much better job
than we all thought it would.


733
00:38:39.672 --> 00:38:44.176
I thought Se-dol Lee would be leading
the game comfortably,


734
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.179
but it turned out that he's struggling
at the moment.


735
00:38:47.513 --> 00:38:50.808
But, I think, eventually,
he will prevail. I hope.


736
00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:54.353
I was, you know, more five to zero,

737
00:38:55.271 --> 00:38:57.773
but now, I'm not sure about that.

738
00:39:02.111 --> 00:39:03.445
What is this?

739
00:39:03.904 --> 00:39:05.197
AlphaGo made a mistake.

740
00:39:06.282 --> 00:39:07.402
AlphaGo made a mistake here.

741
00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.326
What a mistake.

742
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:11.495
It might be the first mistake,

743
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:15.457
kind of a clear mistake that white made.

744
00:39:15.833 --> 00:39:19.753
AlphaGo is making mistakes
at the endgame from time to time.


745
00:39:20.588 --> 00:39:23.632
If AlphaGo wins
by a small difference in the end,


746
00:39:24.091 --> 00:39:26.802
it is possible that it played
just enough to win.


747
00:39:27.469 --> 00:39:29.597
The reason I stopped talking a minute ago

748
00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.600
was that according to my count,
AlphaGo may have more points.


749
00:39:33.601 --> 00:39:35.769
I didn't tell you
because I couldn't believe it.


750
00:39:35.853 --> 00:39:37.438
It seems like a mistake,

751
00:39:37.521 --> 00:39:39.958
but because it's based on calculation,
it's actually not a mistake.


752
00:39:39.982 --> 00:39:41.108
Yes, yes.

753
00:39:41.483 --> 00:39:43.819
So if it's actually based
on calculation...


754
00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.947
it is so scary.

755
00:39:47.031 --> 00:39:50.367
It means it's just playing
with its opponent.


756
00:39:50.451 --> 00:39:52.291
Myung-wan, it looks like
you have got to count.


757
00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:53.704
Yeah, right.

758
00:39:53.787 --> 00:39:56.165
- What do you think? Yeah.
- It's done. Yes.


759
00:39:56.248 --> 00:39:58.626
White won a lot at this time.
It looks like it.


760
00:39:58.709 --> 00:40:00.502
If it's like this, white
has won by a lot.

761
00:40:00.586 --> 00:40:01.420
Yeah.

762
00:40:01.503 --> 00:40:03.130
Two, three. I can't believe it.

763
00:40:03.547 --> 00:40:06.342
Thirty-six, thirty-seven...

764
00:40:06.425 --> 00:40:07.426
Seventy-two.

765
00:40:09.011 --> 00:40:10.179
He lost.

766
00:40:11.597 --> 00:40:12.598
He lost.

767
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.059
Whoa, it's so shocking.

768
00:40:15.142 --> 00:40:19.146
I... I expected AlphaGo
to win only one game.


769
00:40:24.526 --> 00:40:25.527
Oh, gosh.

770
00:40:32.826 --> 00:40:36.497
I can feel his pain. 
Like he was...

771
00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:39.333
He couldn't believe, you know.
He couldn't accept it.


772
00:40:39.416 --> 00:40:42.878
It took him some time
to accept the outcome.


773
00:40:44.963 --> 00:40:47.424
Maybe AlphaGo is very strong now,

774
00:40:47.508 --> 00:40:50.219
but he did not want
to believe he will lose.


775
00:40:50.803 --> 00:40:52.429
And as Go professional players,

776
00:40:52.513 --> 00:40:54.390
we can't believe this,

777
00:40:54.473 --> 00:40:59.436
because, for us,
it's something unimaginable.


778
00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:02.773
It's not something that can happen now.
It's impossible.


779
00:41:03.315 --> 00:41:05.109
But, in reality...

780
00:41:05.901 --> 00:41:06.944
it is happening now.

781
00:41:08.487 --> 00:41:10.989
I think he resigned
in a very polite way.


782
00:41:11.907 --> 00:41:14.535
Se-dol Lee plays black,
but he put a white stone.


783
00:41:23.085 --> 00:41:24.420
I think he resigned.

784
00:41:26.714 --> 00:41:27.756
Oh, my gosh.

785
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:31.552
- Look at the time. It's slow.
- Yeah.


786
00:41:31.635 --> 00:41:32.678
Wow.

787
00:41:40.811 --> 00:41:41.811
You got this.

788
00:41:42.396 --> 00:41:44.064
- Congratulations.
- Hey.


789
00:41:44.356 --> 00:41:45.356
What's up?

790
00:41:46.734 --> 00:41:51.238
I feel really good.
I feel like I really believe in AlphaGo.


791
00:41:51.947 --> 00:41:54.366
Of course, it's natural that humans
want humans to win.


792
00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.410
I mean, I think that's a natural response.

793
00:41:56.493 --> 00:41:58.245
But AlphaGo is human-created,

794
00:41:58.328 --> 00:42:01.832
and I think that's the ultimate sign
of human ingenuity and cleverness.


795
00:42:02.207 --> 00:42:04.042
Everything that AlphaGo does,

796
00:42:04.126 --> 00:42:08.213
it does, because a human has either
created the data that it learns from,


797
00:42:08.297 --> 00:42:11.133
created the learning algorithm
that learns from that data,


798
00:42:11.216 --> 00:42:12.676
created the search algorithm.

799
00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.804
All of these things have come from humans.

800
00:42:15.888 --> 00:42:18.766
So, really, this is a human endeavor.

801
00:42:33.322 --> 00:42:35.491
In the battle
between man versus machine,


802
00:42:35.574 --> 00:42:37.159
a computer just came out the victor.

803
00:42:37.242 --> 00:42:39.995
DeepMind put
its computer program to the test


804
00:42:40.078 --> 00:42:42.873
against one of the brightest minds
in the world and won.


805
00:42:42.956 --> 00:42:45.250
AlphaGo beat
a professional player


806
00:42:45.334 --> 00:42:48.712
who has 18 Go World Championships
under his belt.


807
00:42:48.796 --> 00:42:52.424
The victory is considered a breakthrough
in artificial intelligence.


808
00:42:54.426 --> 00:42:56.553
First of all,

809
00:42:56.637 --> 00:42:58.323
I would have to say
that I was very surprised,


810
00:42:58.347 --> 00:43:01.850
because I didn't think
that I would lose the game.


811
00:43:02.935 --> 00:43:05.687
I think the mistakes I made
in the beginning


812
00:43:05.771 --> 00:43:07.606
lasted until the very end.

813
00:43:07.689 --> 00:43:09.650
That's why I lost this game.

814
00:43:10.025 --> 00:43:12.236
I wasn't able to foresee.

815
00:43:12.319 --> 00:43:15.823
I didn't think that AlphaGo would
play the game in such a perfect manner.


816
00:43:15.906 --> 00:43:22.204
I have won world championship titles
and have a lot of experience,


817
00:43:22.287 --> 00:43:27.459
so losing one game won't affect me
in playing games in the future.


818
00:43:27.543 --> 00:43:31.713
I think now it's 50/50.

819
00:43:32.214 --> 00:43:37.427
I would like to express
my respect to the team


820
00:43:37.511 --> 00:43:41.974
for developing such an amazing program

821
00:43:42.057 --> 00:43:43.684
like AlphaGo.

822
00:43:45.894 --> 00:43:47.020
In research,

823
00:43:47.104 --> 00:43:49.940
we normally work
to produce an academic paper.


824
00:43:50.023 --> 00:43:52.043
It gets published,
and maybe we get to talk about it


825
00:43:52.067 --> 00:43:53.527
in a conference if we're lucky.

826
00:43:55.445 --> 00:43:57.322
This is not normal for a research.

827
00:43:57.406 --> 00:44:01.994
In fact, I've never experienced any
media attention remotely close to this.


828
00:44:02.077 --> 00:44:06.331
So, it's a special moment for us all,
and we're just enjoying it while it lasts.


829
00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.048
In a matchup between
man and machine, who wins?


830
00:44:15.132 --> 00:44:16.842
So far, it's the machine.

831
00:44:16.925 --> 00:44:20.554
In Seoul, South Korea,
the artificially intelligent computer


832
00:44:20.637 --> 00:44:25.392
defeated the global champion
in the ancient Chinese board game Go.


833
00:44:25.475 --> 00:44:26.744
AlphaGo Shock
AI Shocked the World


834
00:44:26.768 --> 00:44:30.230
Se-dol Lee lost the first matchup,
but he's got four more chances.


835
00:44:30.606 --> 00:44:31.899
This is the team

836
00:44:31.982 --> 00:44:35.485
that played Go with Se-dol Lee.

837
00:44:35.569 --> 00:44:37.070
We got our newspapers.

838
00:44:37.154 --> 00:44:39.514
But we are not responsible.
It's just the man in the beanie.


839
00:44:42.451 --> 00:44:43.285
Sorry.

840
00:44:43.368 --> 00:44:45.412
AI Defeats Human Brain

841
00:44:45.495 --> 00:44:47.539
It is a bit strange
being on the front cover


842
00:44:47.623 --> 00:44:49.708
and everything as a computer scientist.

843
00:44:49.791 --> 00:44:52.169
Normally, you sit there
in your corner and you code.


844
00:44:52.252 --> 00:44:53.879
Nobody really knows about it.

845
00:44:53.962 --> 00:44:55.148
Perhaps you've heard the joke,

846
00:44:55.172 --> 00:44:57.299
"How can you tell
that a computer scientist


847
00:44:57.382 --> 00:44:59.635
is an extrovert and not an introvert?"

848
00:45:00.344 --> 00:45:02.471
If he's an extrovert,
he looks at your shoes


849
00:45:02.554 --> 00:45:04.765
when he's talking to you,
instead of at his own.


850
00:45:06.642 --> 00:45:11.146
If you look at Aja,
he avoids all the cameras like crazy.


851
00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.483
He's like, the game is finished,
and he's, like, out the back,


852
00:45:14.566 --> 00:45:16.151
and back in his room.

853
00:45:16.902 --> 00:45:20.405
And I think a lot of computer scientists
would be like that.


854
00:45:20.906 --> 00:45:24.409
We are more about doing our work
than standing in the spotlight.


855
00:45:26.078 --> 00:45:30.040
Hello, and welcome
to Game Two, Round Two,


856
00:45:30.123 --> 00:45:32.668
in the Google DeepMind Challenge

857
00:45:32.751 --> 00:45:35.545
throwdown between man and machine.

858
00:45:35.837 --> 00:45:39.341
Game One, the machine takes down man.

859
00:45:39.675 --> 00:45:42.803
Huge shock. Headlines around the world.

860
00:45:42.886 --> 00:45:46.932
The reactions on the ground here
from the folks in Korea were just stunned.


861
00:45:47.015 --> 00:45:50.519
They estimate 60 million people
watched the game in China alone.


862
00:45:50.602 --> 00:45:52.938
Probably bringing it up
to maybe 80 million people


863
00:45:53.021 --> 00:45:54.356
who watched this game worldwide.

864
00:45:54.439 --> 00:45:55.941
It was just incredible.

865
00:45:56.024 --> 00:45:59.611
And if anything, today is probably
even more of a madhouse.


866
00:46:00.278 --> 00:46:01.780
So, Se-dol Lee knows today.

867
00:46:01.863 --> 00:46:04.491
He knows that this is just
a really important game. Right?


868
00:46:04.574 --> 00:46:05.574
He has got to win.

869
00:46:09.955 --> 00:46:11.873
Go, Se-dol Lee!

870
00:46:11.957 --> 00:46:13.125
Fighting!

871
00:46:14.334 --> 00:46:15.836
Can you tell what Lee

872
00:46:15.919 --> 00:46:17.230
is thinking by looking at his face?

873
00:46:17.254 --> 00:46:18.088
Does he seem nervous?

874
00:46:18.171 --> 00:46:20.590
Yes.
Lee seems to be very tense.


875
00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:24.761
My guess is that
he didn't sleep well last night.


876
00:46:24.845 --> 00:46:27.013
Se-dol Lee on white,

877
00:46:27.097 --> 00:46:30.267
I think probably looking
for a little payback.


878
00:46:30.684 --> 00:46:33.937
My impression is that maybe
he underestimated AlphaGo,


879
00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:35.689
and he is going to change his tactics.

880
00:46:37.941 --> 00:46:40.569
Se-dol Lee is playing
much, much slower today.


881
00:46:40.652 --> 00:46:41.528
Yeah.

882
00:46:41.611 --> 00:46:43.155
- Which is going to affect us.
- Yes.


883
00:46:43.572 --> 00:46:45.212
He's playing at half the speed, actually.

884
00:46:45.949 --> 00:46:48.076
It is hard to say who is ahead

885
00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.327
or better now.

886
00:46:49.411 --> 00:46:53.540
The last two moves
make me doubt AlphaGo's ability.


887
00:46:53.623 --> 00:46:56.334
- But we have to stay alert.
- Yes.


888
00:46:56.418 --> 00:46:58.699
- Yes. This is difficult.
- AlphaGo is hard to understand.


889
00:46:58.754 --> 00:47:00.630
If I see anything about AlphaGo

890
00:47:00.714 --> 00:47:03.675
that is not normal,
is maybe the way it handles a game


891
00:47:03.759 --> 00:47:06.052
- when it thinks it is ahead.
- Yes.


892
00:47:06.136 --> 00:47:08.555
We're actually going to have a visit
from one of the team,


893
00:47:08.638 --> 00:47:11.224
and we will talk about exactly
that point from the inside.


894
00:47:11.308 --> 00:47:12.768
Thanks so much for coming by, Thore.

895
00:47:12.851 --> 00:47:13.935
I really appreciate it.

896
00:47:14.144 --> 00:47:18.648
Can you sort of share a bit
of what is going on in AlphaGo?


897
00:47:18.732 --> 00:47:22.027
So, AlphaGo has these three
main components.


898
00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:23.987
There's the policy network,

899
00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:28.950
which was trained on high-level games
to imitate those players.


900
00:47:29.451 --> 00:47:33.288
And then, we have a second component.
We call this the value net.


901
00:47:33.371 --> 00:47:35.916
And it can evaluate the board position

902
00:47:35.999 --> 00:47:40.003
and say what is the probability of winning
in this particular position.


903
00:47:40.337 --> 00:47:43.215
And the third component
is the tree search,


904
00:47:43.298 --> 00:47:47.010
where it would look through
different variations of the game


905
00:47:47.093 --> 00:47:49.679
and try to figure out
what will happen in the future.


906
00:47:52.974 --> 00:47:55.143
So if we now take
a position like this,


907
00:47:55.685 --> 00:47:59.105
first, the policy network
would scan the position


908
00:47:59.439 --> 00:48:04.069
and come up with what would be
the interesting spots to play,


909
00:48:04.569 --> 00:48:07.489
and it builds up a tree of variations.

910
00:48:07.572 --> 00:48:10.283
And then employs this value net

911
00:48:10.367 --> 00:48:15.205
that tells it how promising is the outcome
of this particular variation.


912
00:48:17.833 --> 00:48:22.504
So, AlphaGo tries to maximize
its probability of winning,


913
00:48:22.921 --> 00:48:26.675
but it doesn't care at all about
the margin by which it wins.


914
00:48:26.758 --> 00:48:28.885
Okay, so when you see
a slow-looking move,


915
00:48:28.969 --> 00:48:32.639
that's maybe an indication that AlphaGo
thinks it has a good chance to win.


916
00:48:32.722 --> 00:48:35.350
- Yeah, that is a little giveaway.
- Yeah.


917
00:48:35.433 --> 00:48:37.553
- A little tell. We're looking for a tell.
- Oh, yeah.


918
00:48:37.602 --> 00:48:39.563
Se-dol Lee is playing

919
00:48:39.646 --> 00:48:42.107
in a completely different style
from his usual style.


920
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:47.279
This is a historic moment
and Se-dol Lee is the center of attention.


921
00:48:47.362 --> 00:48:49.698
He must be feeling immense pressure.

922
00:48:49.781 --> 00:48:54.494
I hope he gets over
this pressure and enjoys the match.


923
00:49:07.382 --> 00:49:09.134
Ooh, it looks like Lee

924
00:49:09.217 --> 00:49:10.577
is taking a little bit of a break.

925
00:49:28.862 --> 00:49:30.572
Se-dol Lee goes to smoke,

926
00:49:31.072 --> 00:49:32.657
and AlphaGo just plays.

927
00:49:32.741 --> 00:49:35.702
It does not think about
whether the opponent will be there or not.


928
00:49:36.119 --> 00:49:39.915
So, Aja sees AlphaGo plays move 37,

929
00:49:40.707 --> 00:49:42.834
and Aja puts the stone on the board.

930
00:49:44.878 --> 00:49:46.379
- Oh.
- Oh, wow.


931
00:49:48.423 --> 00:49:50.508
- Oh, it's totally an unthinkable move.
- Yes.


932
00:49:51.217 --> 00:49:52.344
The value...

933
00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.932
That's a very...
That's a very surprising move.


934
00:49:57.015 --> 00:50:00.226
I thought it was a mistake.

935
00:50:01.561 --> 00:50:04.940
When I saw this move,
for me, it was just a big shock.


936
00:50:05.023 --> 00:50:06.023
What?

937
00:50:06.858 --> 00:50:08.652
Normally, humans will never play this one

938
00:50:08.735 --> 00:50:10.278
because it's bad.

939
00:50:11.529 --> 00:50:13.249
It is just bad.
We don't know why, it's bad.


940
00:50:13.823 --> 00:50:15.450
It is a little bit high.

941
00:50:15.742 --> 00:50:16.618
Yeah?

942
00:50:16.701 --> 00:50:17.994
It's the fifth line.

943
00:50:18.078 --> 00:50:20.497
Normally, you don't make
a shoulder hit on the fifth line.


944
00:50:21.081 --> 00:50:24.376
So, coming on top of a fourth line zone
is really unusual.


945
00:50:24.876 --> 00:50:26.503
Yeah, that's an exciting move.

946
00:50:26.586 --> 00:50:29.297
I think we are seeing
an original move here.


947
00:50:29.965 --> 00:50:34.344
That is the kind of move
that you play Go for.


948
00:50:35.887 --> 00:50:36.887
Hey.

949
00:50:39.015 --> 00:50:40.433
Interesting stuff.

950
00:50:40.517 --> 00:50:43.061
- This fifth line shoulder hit was good.
- Yeah.


951
00:50:43.144 --> 00:50:44.479
And I wasn't expecting that.

952
00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:48.358
I don't really know if it's a good
or bad move at this point.


953
00:50:48.441 --> 00:50:51.903
The professional commentators
almost unanimously said


954
00:50:51.987 --> 00:50:55.156
that not a single human player
would have chosen move 37.


955
00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:57.784
So, I actually had a poke around
in AlphaGo


956
00:50:57.867 --> 00:50:59.619
to see what AlphaGo thought.

957
00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.914
And AlphaGo actually agreed
with that assessment.


958
00:51:03.456 --> 00:51:06.751
AlphaGo said there was
a 1-in-10,000 probability


959
00:51:06.835 --> 00:51:10.338
that move 37 would have been played
by a human player.


960
00:51:10.422 --> 00:51:12.841
So it knew that this was
an extremely unlikely move.


961
00:51:12.924 --> 00:51:15.969
It went beyond its human guide,

962
00:51:16.052 --> 00:51:19.264
and it came up with something new
and creative and different.


963
00:51:20.223 --> 00:51:24.978
I am very much watching the game
through these commentators.


964
00:51:25.061 --> 00:51:26.187
That is the way it works.

965
00:51:26.271 --> 00:51:28.648
So when they are confused,
I'm certainly confused.


966
00:51:28.732 --> 00:51:30.492
At the same time,
I'm latching on to the fact


967
00:51:30.567 --> 00:51:32.152
that they are confused, right?

968
00:51:32.235 --> 00:51:34.154
That is an interesting moment.

969
00:51:34.237 --> 00:51:36.906
When everyone else is confused,
who is not confused, right,


970
00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:37.991
besides the machine?

971
00:51:42.412 --> 00:51:45.999
I want to see Se-dol Lee
when he sees this move.


972
00:51:51.212 --> 00:51:52.881
He is back. Lee is back.

973
00:52:15.111 --> 00:52:16.613
I thought AlphaGo

974
00:52:16.696 --> 00:52:19.407
was based on probability calculation

975
00:52:19.991 --> 00:52:23.912
and that it was merely a machine.

976
00:52:24.579 --> 00:52:26.414
But when I saw this move,
I changed my mind.


977
00:52:27.582 --> 00:52:29.334
Surely, AlphaGo is creative.

978
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:36.758
This move was really creative
and beautiful.


979
00:52:40.011 --> 00:52:41.346
Normally, he thinks

980
00:52:41.429 --> 00:52:43.473
for about one or two minutes
not more than that.


981
00:52:43.556 --> 00:52:46.601
But this time, he thought
for more than 12 minutes.


982
00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:59.280
The more I look at this move,
I feel something changed.


983
00:53:00.907 --> 00:53:03.701
Maybe, for humans, we think it is bad,

984
00:53:03.785 --> 00:53:05.912
but for AlphaGo, why not?

985
00:53:06.913 --> 00:53:08.414
Go is like geopolitics,

986
00:53:08.498 --> 00:53:10.291
like something small that happens here,

987
00:53:10.375 --> 00:53:11.626
it can have a ripple effect,

988
00:53:12.168 --> 00:53:15.713
you know, hours down the road
in a different part of the board.


989
00:53:16.089 --> 00:53:19.175
The game kind of turned on its axis
at that moment.


990
00:53:19.884 --> 00:53:21.678
This move was very special,

991
00:53:21.761 --> 00:53:23.054
because with this move,

992
00:53:23.429 --> 00:53:25.473
all the stones played before

993
00:53:25.557 --> 00:53:26.641
worked together.

994
00:53:26.724 --> 00:53:27.934
It was connected.

995
00:53:28.017 --> 00:53:30.353
It looked like a network,
linked everywhere.


996
00:53:30.812 --> 00:53:32.021
It was very special.

997
00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:33.565
Very special.

998
00:53:35.024 --> 00:53:36.734
This move made me think

999
00:53:36.818 --> 00:53:40.029
about Go in a new light.

1000
00:53:40.905 --> 00:53:44.993
What does creativity mean in Go?

1001
00:53:45.785 --> 00:53:47.996
It was a really meaningful move.

1002
00:53:50.999 --> 00:53:52.500
This is a tough game

1003
00:53:52.584 --> 00:53:53.459
for Se-dol Lee.

1004
00:53:53.543 --> 00:53:55.920
AlphaGo is just not letting Se-dol Lee

1005
00:53:56.004 --> 00:53:57.255
- do what he wants.
- Right.


1006
00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:00.300
Black has almost 60 points. That's a lot.

1007
00:54:00.842 --> 00:54:02.218
That's not a good sign.

1008
00:54:02.844 --> 00:54:04.262
Oh. Oh.

1009
00:54:04.345 --> 00:54:06.931
Se-dol Lee just slapped himself
on the side of the head.


1010
00:54:08.057 --> 00:54:09.184
Oh, wow.

1011
00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:11.895
I think black is ahead at this point.

1012
00:54:13.229 --> 00:54:15.440
It's looking good, isn't it?
We're on that steady...


1013
00:54:16.316 --> 00:54:17.650
steady path now.

1014
00:54:19.402 --> 00:54:21.362
I just saw Se-dol Lee...

1015
00:54:22.322 --> 00:54:23.865
lose so much.

1016
00:54:23.948 --> 00:54:27.076
Normally, we would have resigned
a long time ago, but he wanted to try.


1017
00:54:27.452 --> 00:54:28.912
He continued to play.

1018
00:54:28.995 --> 00:54:31.289
He just didn't want to resign.

1019
00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:48.806
Because then white...
Oh, he resigned.


1020
00:54:49.557 --> 00:54:52.268
It looks like Se-dol Lee
has just resigned.


1021
00:54:55.521 --> 00:54:57.649
It doesn't make any sense.
I didn't foresee that one.


1022
00:54:57.732 --> 00:55:00.109
- Move 37, very beautiful.
- Yes.


1023
00:55:00.193 --> 00:55:01.819
Beautiful, yeah. Beautiful.

1024
00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.282
Is he okay?

1025
00:55:07.575 --> 00:55:10.620
I brought his friend,
because yesterday I noticed


1026
00:55:10.703 --> 00:55:12.956
that he really wanted to analyze the game.

1027
00:55:13.039 --> 00:55:16.334
I didn't realize how bad it was.

1028
00:55:20.838 --> 00:55:22.632
There was this heavy sadness

1029
00:55:22.715 --> 00:55:24.592
over that whole floor,

1030
00:55:24.676 --> 00:55:26.219
and you could feel it during the game.

1031
00:55:26.302 --> 00:55:27.762
I felt it during the game.

1032
00:55:27.845 --> 00:55:31.683
And I'm leaving the commentary room
to go to the press conference,


1033
00:55:31.766 --> 00:55:33.184
and I was stopped by someone,

1034
00:55:33.268 --> 00:55:34.560
another technology reporter.

1035
00:55:34.644 --> 00:55:36.437
At first, all he wanted to talk about

1036
00:55:36.521 --> 00:55:38.314
was the technology and how great this was,

1037
00:55:38.398 --> 00:55:42.527
but then, even he kind of slipped
into this moment of melancholy


1038
00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:44.112
where he was upset as well.

1039
00:55:45.905 --> 00:55:51.369
Yesterday, I was surprised,
but today, I am quite speechless.


1040
00:55:52.078 --> 00:55:53.913
"I am quite speechless.

1041
00:55:53.997 --> 00:55:57.083
I admit that it was a very clear loss
on my part.


1042
00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.335
From the very beginning of the game,

1043
00:55:59.419 --> 00:56:03.131
there was not a moment in time
that I felt that I was leading the game."


1044
00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:07.385
You feel elated,
and you feel a little bit scared.


1045
00:56:07.468 --> 00:56:10.722
There is something, I think,
frightening to people


1046
00:56:10.805 --> 00:56:13.016
about a machine that learns on its own.

1047
00:56:13.599 --> 00:56:16.894
For us, AlphaGo is obviously
just some computer program.


1048
00:56:17.353 --> 00:56:19.897
But looking at the commentary
on the Internet,


1049
00:56:19.981 --> 00:56:22.275
I already saw the commentators
call AlphaGo


1050
00:56:22.358 --> 00:56:24.485
like "he" and "she" during the games.

1051
00:56:25.236 --> 00:56:26.821
Completely unconsciously.

1052
00:56:27.405 --> 00:56:30.742
Which... AlphaGo is really
a very, very simple program.


1053
00:56:30.825 --> 00:56:34.329
It's not anywhere close to full AI,
and we already see that happening.


1054
00:56:34.412 --> 00:56:35.788
So I find that very interesting.

1055
00:56:40.877 --> 00:56:43.379
The tendency
to anthropomorphize AI systems


1056
00:56:43.463 --> 00:56:45.631
is one of the big obstacles

1057
00:56:45.715 --> 00:56:47.633
in the way of actually trying
to understand


1058
00:56:47.717 --> 00:56:50.345
how AI might impact the world
in the future.


1059
00:56:50.428 --> 00:56:51.864
For example, the conversation is about

1060
00:56:51.888 --> 00:56:53.848
what could go wrong, what the risks are.

1061
00:56:54.223 --> 00:56:56.434
And invariably, you see
this Terminator picture.


1062
00:56:56.517 --> 00:56:59.187
Every single time,
there are these red glowing eyes, right?


1063
00:56:59.270 --> 00:57:01.773
We're really closer
to a smart washing machine


1064
00:57:01.856 --> 00:57:03.441
than Terminator.

1065
00:57:03.524 --> 00:57:06.652
If you look at today's AI,

1066
00:57:06.736 --> 00:57:09.280
we are really very nascent.

1067
00:57:09.364 --> 00:57:11.366
I'm extremely excited

1068
00:57:11.449 --> 00:57:14.702
and passionate about AI's potential.

1069
00:57:14.786 --> 00:57:18.122
But AI is still
very limited in its power.

1070
00:57:18.623 --> 00:57:20.750
I think that people
are right to think


1071
00:57:21.376 --> 00:57:25.254
that there is a danger that as we continue
to improve these systems,


1072
00:57:25.338 --> 00:57:30.385
that we might miss that threshold
where we do cross over into danger.


1073
00:57:30.468 --> 00:57:31.469
But the good news is

1074
00:57:31.552 --> 00:57:33.697
that there are already people
thinking about those dangers.


1075
00:57:33.721 --> 00:57:36.533
You know, there's a lot of talk now,
and we are leading the discussion on this,


1076
00:57:36.557 --> 00:57:37.993
that maybe there should be a kind of,

1077
00:57:38.017 --> 00:57:40.770
cross-industry best practices
working group or something.


1078
00:57:40.853 --> 00:57:41.688
Right.

1079
00:57:41.771 --> 00:57:45.525
Where the leaders of the research teams
in those organizations,


1080
00:57:45.608 --> 00:57:48.778
you know, the big ones that are working
on AI, IBM, Microsoft, so on,


1081
00:57:48.861 --> 00:57:52.782
come together and make sure that AI
is used ethically and responsibly.


1082
00:57:53.741 --> 00:57:57.620
I think what is important
is that there is this community of people


1083
00:57:57.704 --> 00:58:01.874
who are leading the cutting edge of AI,

1084
00:58:01.958 --> 00:58:04.043
who are interacting with academics,

1085
00:58:04.127 --> 00:58:07.130
and already are thinking
about the long term,


1086
00:58:07.213 --> 00:58:10.883
and how we can ensure
that innovation is responsible


1087
00:58:10.967 --> 00:58:13.010
as the power of these machines
gets even greater.


1088
00:58:13.094 --> 00:58:15.471
Se-dol Lee Lost by Resignation

1089
00:58:15.555 --> 00:58:16.639
This is it, folks.

1090
00:58:17.348 --> 00:58:21.894
Day Three, Game Three.
Se-dol Lee, Go Master.


1091
00:58:22.437 --> 00:58:25.857
Back to the wall. 
He's down two-zero.

1092
00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:29.318
He's got to win
today to keep hope alive.

1093
00:58:29.402 --> 00:58:32.822
Se-dol Lee had a day off

1094
00:58:32.905 --> 00:58:34.532
after losing two games,

1095
00:58:34.949 --> 00:58:39.704
and he gathered with Go professionals

1096
00:58:39.787 --> 00:58:43.416
and analyzed the game all night.

1097
00:58:43.499 --> 00:58:46.836
I heard that four pros, yeah,
went to visit him.


1098
00:58:46.919 --> 00:58:50.006
- Hm.
- To console him and to review AlphaGo's...


1099
00:58:50.089 --> 00:58:52.800
Console him?
Do you think he's upset, or...


1100
00:58:52.884 --> 00:58:55.052
I mean, Se-dol Lee
is upset. Yeah.


1101
00:58:55.553 --> 00:58:58.347
In the beginning,
there was a fierce fight,


1102
00:58:58.431 --> 00:59:00.683
and AlphaGo played very well.

1103
00:59:00.767 --> 00:59:02.810
So he secured a very early lead.

1104
00:59:03.227 --> 00:59:06.564
From move 50, the win rate
was very high already.


1105
00:59:06.647 --> 00:59:09.025
It was climbing toward 100%.

1106
00:59:09.358 --> 00:59:10.526
Oh, that's a pretty move.

1107
00:59:10.610 --> 00:59:12.695
What's your probability rating?

1108
00:59:12.779 --> 00:59:14.781
- Like, 91?
- No.


1109
00:59:14.864 --> 00:59:17.867
- It seems 70, you think?
- No.


1110
00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:20.161
He must want to win desperately right now.

1111
00:59:20.244 --> 00:59:21.913
THE CHALLENGE OF AI

1112
00:59:21.996 --> 00:59:24.290
But I think the pressure

1113
00:59:24.373 --> 00:59:26.918
and the psychological burden is adding up.

1114
00:59:27.001 --> 00:59:30.046
Today must be the worst.

1115
00:59:30.129 --> 00:59:31.839
I personally believe,

1116
00:59:31.923 --> 00:59:36.177
when you try too hard to win,
you will lose.


1117
00:59:36.886 --> 00:59:38.137
He tried to fight

1118
00:59:38.221 --> 00:59:39.430
directly in the game

1119
00:59:39.514 --> 00:59:40.723
but it's not his style.

1120
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:44.811
When we change our style
to play against an opponent,


1121
00:59:44.894 --> 00:59:46.896
normally, it's very, very bad.

1122
00:59:50.107 --> 00:59:53.736
So it's an easier game for AlphaGo.

1123
00:59:54.862 --> 00:59:56.906
- It's looking good for us.
- Hopefully, I think...


1124
00:59:56.989 --> 00:59:59.951
You know, that black group is huge,
and it has got nowhere to go,


1125
01:00:00.034 --> 01:00:01.994
and it is going to be running around.

1126
01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:14.382
I don't know how
to describe the situation.


1127
01:00:14.465 --> 01:00:16.634
If I were black, 
I will resign.

1128
01:00:17.093 --> 01:00:21.848
We should admit that we are facing
the strongest existence ever,


1129
01:00:21.931 --> 01:00:23.474
ever in the Go history.

1130
01:00:23.933 --> 01:00:25.893
There's no point
in playing out the endgame,


1131
01:00:25.977 --> 01:00:28.396
and you're going to lose, right? So...

1132
01:00:31.357 --> 01:00:32.900
Even if black can live there...

1133
01:00:32.984 --> 01:00:35.194
- It's done. It's done.
- Oh, he resigned. Okay.


1134
01:00:35.278 --> 01:00:37.029
Wow. Wow.

1135
01:00:38.698 --> 01:00:41.325
You saw history made here tonight.

1136
01:00:41.659 --> 01:00:43.536
AlphaGo has won again.
Three straight wins.


1137
01:00:43.619 --> 01:00:45.538
Three straight wins.
Has won the match.


1138
01:00:46.998 --> 01:00:50.710
When Se-dol Lee resigned
from the game, he looked unhappy.


1139
01:00:50.793 --> 01:00:53.254
It was not just he lost the tournament,

1140
01:00:53.337 --> 01:00:55.631
it was especially about this game,

1141
01:00:55.715 --> 01:00:58.259
because he did not play his game.

1142
01:00:59.218 --> 01:01:02.471
I am very hurt about this, very hurt.

1143
01:01:03.973 --> 01:01:06.100
But, I can't do anything.

1144
01:01:09.186 --> 01:01:11.480
You know, suddenly, I feel
a bit ambivalent about it,


1145
01:01:11.564 --> 01:01:12.982
given I'm a games player,

1146
01:01:13.065 --> 01:01:15.776
and, you know, Go is the pinnacle
of board games.


1147
01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.045
But I really liked the statement

1148
01:01:17.069 --> 01:01:20.031
of one of the top Chinese professionals.
He said, you know,


1149
01:01:20.114 --> 01:01:25.369
"If AlphaGo wins, maybe we'll really start
to get to see what this game is about."


1150
01:01:27.038 --> 01:01:28.664
I couldn't celebrate.

1151
01:01:28.998 --> 01:01:31.500
It was fantastic that we had won,

1152
01:01:31.584 --> 01:01:33.461
but there was such
a big part of me

1153
01:01:33.544 --> 01:01:37.757
that saw this man trying so hard

1154
01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:42.094
and being so disappointed.

1155
01:01:58.235 --> 01:02:01.447
I see on the Internet, many people
are talking about Se-dol Lee.


1156
01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:03.157
Maybe he didn't play his best.

1157
01:02:03.449 --> 01:02:05.618
You know, we are Go players.

1158
01:02:05.701 --> 01:02:08.412
Okay, sometimes in China,
in Korea, in Japan


1159
01:02:08.496 --> 01:02:10.122
we see Go like art.

1160
01:02:10.539 --> 01:02:11.916
We are artists, you know.

1161
01:02:11.999 --> 01:02:15.127
- We play our best for Go.
- Right. Right.


1162
01:02:15.211 --> 01:02:17.922
- So, please be gentle with Se-dol Lee.
- Right.


1163
01:02:18.005 --> 01:02:21.092
He is a very, very good player.
He is a great player.


1164
01:02:21.634 --> 01:02:24.303
I was in the room. I saw Se-dol Lee.
He wanted to win.


1165
01:02:24.387 --> 01:02:26.514
He tried everything.

1166
01:02:27.348 --> 01:02:30.726
It's just we can't. It's just... So...

1167
01:02:32.979 --> 01:02:35.982
I think I have to express
my apologies first.


1168
01:02:38.192 --> 01:02:41.153
If I had been able to play better
or smarter,


1169
01:02:41.237 --> 01:02:43.280
the results might have been different.

1170
01:02:43.364 --> 01:02:46.492
I think I disappointed too many of you
this time.


1171
01:02:46.575 --> 01:02:49.704
I want to apologize
for being so powerless.


1172
01:02:50.705 --> 01:02:52.707
I've never felt...

1173
01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:55.376
this much pressure,

1174
01:02:56.002 --> 01:02:58.295
this much weight.

1175
01:02:58.379 --> 01:03:02.425
I think I was
too weak to overcome it.

1176
01:03:04.051 --> 01:03:07.304
I can't believe
this is happening.


1177
01:03:07.388 --> 01:03:10.266
Regardless of your opponent's level,

1178
01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:13.144
to be defeated not by three-zero,
but five-zero?


1179
01:03:13.853 --> 01:03:18.065
Losing to AlphaGo by five-zero

1180
01:03:18.149 --> 01:03:20.985
would really hurt my pride.

1181
01:03:21.068 --> 01:03:26.282
I also feel so bad for the people
who have supported me.


1182
01:03:26.991 --> 01:03:28.409
Se-dol Lee, 9 dan,

1183
01:03:28.492 --> 01:03:32.371
has the strongest heart of anyone I know.

1184
01:03:32.747 --> 01:03:39.003
He is fighting a lonely fight.

1185
01:03:39.086 --> 01:03:42.548
His opponent does not exist
in physical form.


1186
01:03:42.631 --> 01:03:45.009
I really feel for him.

1187
01:03:45.092 --> 01:03:47.344
We still have Games Four and Five,

1188
01:03:47.428 --> 01:03:53.392
and if Se-dol Lee, 9 dan,
plays like himself,


1189
01:03:53.476 --> 01:03:55.644
I believe we can beat the machine.

1190
01:04:07.156 --> 01:04:09.116
You could see he was more relaxed

1191
01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.285
after he had lost
three games in a row.

1192
01:04:11.786 --> 01:04:13.704
That said, the stakes were still high.

1193
01:04:14.038 --> 01:04:17.041
You know, in the end,
it isn't about pride.


1194
01:04:18.459 --> 01:04:20.419
He did not feel confident,

1195
01:04:20.836 --> 01:04:22.254
but he felt light.

1196
01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:27.009
Can Se-dol Lee
find AlphaGo's weakness?


1197
01:04:27.093 --> 01:04:29.053
Is there, in fact, a weakness?

1198
01:04:29.136 --> 01:04:30.816
I was thinking I
would just pull the plug.

1199
01:04:30.846 --> 01:04:32.282
- You would just pull the plug?
- Yeah.


1200
01:04:32.306 --> 01:04:34.642
Everyone is still
cheering for Se-dol Lee.


1201
01:04:34.725 --> 01:04:35.851
And...

1202
01:04:36.727 --> 01:04:38.437
Yeah, it's not going very well.

1203
01:04:38.938 --> 01:04:40.523
Se-dol Lee has chosen

1204
01:04:40.606 --> 01:04:42.233
to play conservatively.

1205
01:04:42.316 --> 01:04:45.402
But I am not sure
it will benefit him.


1206
01:04:45.486 --> 01:04:46.486
I agree.

1207
01:04:46.529 --> 01:04:48.689
Yes, it doesn't look like
a very good strategy for him.


1208
01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.366
It feels pretty good

1209
01:04:50.449 --> 01:04:52.159
for black at this point.

1210
01:04:52.243 --> 01:04:54.846
- It feels pretty good for black, yes.
- It's pretty good for black. Yeah.


1211
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:57.206
I want Se-dol Lee to play his game.

1212
01:04:57.748 --> 01:05:00.417
Because, at that moment,
he tried various things


1213
01:05:00.501 --> 01:05:03.170
to play with AlphaGo,
to understand AlphaGo,


1214
01:05:03.254 --> 01:05:05.464
but he never tried to play himself.

1215
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:07.776
I've said this many, many times,

1216
01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:10.678
AlphaGo looks like a real mirror.

1217
01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:12.847
When you play with AlphaGo,

1218
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:15.599
you feel very strange.

1219
01:05:15.975 --> 01:05:18.686
It feels like you
are naked all the time.

1220
01:05:19.311 --> 01:05:21.790
The first time you see this,
you wouldn't want to see because...


1221
01:05:21.814 --> 01:05:24.316
"Oh, is this me? The real me?"

1222
01:05:25.151 --> 01:05:27.528
And the more you see,
you learn to accept it.


1223
01:05:27.903 --> 01:05:29.405
"Oh, this is the real me.

1224
01:05:29.488 --> 01:05:32.283
So, how... Now, what shall I do?"

1225
01:05:36.912 --> 01:05:39.456
It's developing into a very,
very dangerous fight.


1226
01:05:40.249 --> 01:05:44.420
This is really Se-dol Lee's type of game.
He likes this kind of fight.


1227
01:05:44.503 --> 01:05:46.755
White has to find something
inside black's territory.


1228
01:05:46.839 --> 01:05:50.092
I think that he
is already planning on trying something.


1229
01:05:50.176 --> 01:05:53.012
So you believe in Se-dol Lee's ability

1230
01:05:53.095 --> 01:05:55.347
to live in that very small area, right?

1231
01:05:55.431 --> 01:05:56.473
Yes. Yes.

1232
01:05:56.557 --> 01:05:58.434
There is a little potential there.

1233
01:05:58.851 --> 01:06:01.103
And I think, maybe he is going to try
to do something.


1234
01:06:01.187 --> 01:06:02.771
- Se-dol Lee magic!
- Nice.


1235
01:06:03.189 --> 01:06:05.941
Oh, what would be
the magic move?


1236
01:06:06.025 --> 01:06:07.818
Se-dol Lee is running short on time,

1237
01:06:07.902 --> 01:06:09.820
but he's going to have to use up
all his time.


1238
01:06:09.904 --> 01:06:12.656
Yeah, he has just burned, like,
seven or eight minutes,


1239
01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:14.116
just on this move already.

1240
01:06:14.742 --> 01:06:16.160
I don't see anything.

1241
01:06:17.203 --> 01:06:19.079
We can't find anything.

1242
01:06:19.163 --> 01:06:20.456
Show us something.

1243
01:06:20.915 --> 01:06:22.374
I don't see any possible move.

1244
01:06:22.458 --> 01:06:24.293
What is Se-dol Lee up to here?

1245
01:06:24.376 --> 01:06:26.170
Yeah, he is really concentrating.

1246
01:06:26.253 --> 01:06:27.713
He really is. Look at that.

1247
01:06:28.964 --> 01:06:30.466
Se-dol Lee is very patient.

1248
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:33.093
He waits. He waits for his moment.

1249
01:06:33.886 --> 01:06:36.388
I feel, sometimes, he is like a wolf,

1250
01:06:36.889 --> 01:06:40.351
waiting in the forest, in the winter.

1251
01:06:41.644 --> 01:06:43.771
He is cold. He's very, very cold.

1252
01:06:44.563 --> 01:06:46.065
But he needs patience.

1253
01:06:46.148 --> 01:06:48.275
But, when the moment comes,

1254
01:06:48.359 --> 01:06:50.694
he goes out to attack.

1255
01:06:52.071 --> 01:06:54.240
This is the hinge of the game.

1256
01:06:54.323 --> 01:06:55.323
Oh.

1257
01:06:55.407 --> 01:06:57.159
Look at that move.
That's an exciting move.


1258
01:06:57.326 --> 01:06:59.870
- Basically, I believe that this time...
- He found a wedge.


1259
01:06:59.954 --> 01:07:00.955
Whoa.

1260
01:07:01.038 --> 01:07:03.916
It's going to change
the equation


1261
01:07:03.999 --> 01:07:05.668
because now black cannot escape.

1262
01:07:05.751 --> 01:07:07.419
That would be so cool if that works.

1263
01:07:11.423 --> 01:07:12.423
Oh!

1264
01:07:14.677 --> 01:07:18.013
AlphaGo has just played
something maybe unusual.


1265
01:07:18.472 --> 01:07:21.892
You know, I'm not actually sure
what AlphaGo is trying to do here.


1266
01:07:21.976 --> 01:07:23.018
What's that about?

1267
01:07:23.102 --> 01:07:24.728
I don't really understand it.

1268
01:07:24.812 --> 01:07:25.688
Well, well.

1269
01:07:25.771 --> 01:07:28.524
That was a sharp drop in win rate.

1270
01:07:28.607 --> 01:07:31.110
That is the sharpest drop
in win rate we have seen.


1271
01:07:31.610 --> 01:07:34.029
She dropped at eight percent.

1272
01:07:34.113 --> 01:07:35.322
- Wow.
- Wow.


1273
01:07:36.282 --> 01:07:39.410
This could be that it actually
can't find a way through.


1274
01:07:39.493 --> 01:07:40.595
- I think this is...
- Uh-huh.


1275
01:07:40.619 --> 01:07:43.330
It has looked far enough ahead
to see that it doesn't work,


1276
01:07:43.414 --> 01:07:45.165
and now maybe it's
on tilt. I don't know.

1277
01:07:45.958 --> 01:07:47.376
There it comes.

1278
01:07:47.459 --> 01:07:49.420
- That was one time.
- There it comes, though.


1279
01:07:49.503 --> 01:07:51.964
It looks like it
has fallen off the cliff.

1280
01:07:52.798 --> 01:07:54.925
- Yeah, it has made a mistake.
- Yeah.


1281
01:07:55.009 --> 01:07:56.802
Did anything strange happen in the...

1282
01:07:57.219 --> 01:07:58.679
- No, it all looked normal.
- Yeah.


1283
01:07:58.762 --> 01:08:01.307
Well, we can definitely say
there is a weakness.


1284
01:08:01.932 --> 01:08:03.612
Well, we definitely say there's a mistake.

1285
01:08:05.019 --> 01:08:09.398
I felt this mixture
of this sinking feeling in my stomach,


1286
01:08:09.481 --> 01:08:12.818
where I was wondering if AlphaGo
was becoming delusional in this situation.


1287
01:08:12.901 --> 01:08:15.195
Where I could see that it was starting
to play strangely,


1288
01:08:15.571 --> 01:08:17.489
and at the same time,
relief, that Se-dol Lee,


1289
01:08:17.573 --> 01:08:20.200
that he was actually
in with a chance now.

1290
01:08:21.827 --> 01:08:24.580
Aja is like trying not to look horrified.

1291
01:08:26.373 --> 01:08:30.669
I knew after move 78,
after, like, 10 or 20 moves,


1292
01:08:31.045 --> 01:08:34.089
I saw AlphaGo's strange moves.

1293
01:08:34.173 --> 01:08:38.635
And, I knew AlphaGo somehow
became crazy, but I didn't realize why.


1294
01:08:38.719 --> 01:08:40.387
What?

1295
01:08:40.471 --> 01:08:43.432
We searched to 95 ahead at that point?

1296
01:08:43.515 --> 01:08:45.035
At the part where it made the mistake?

1297
01:08:45.476 --> 01:08:47.436
- Yes.
- I think that something went wrong.


1298
01:08:47.519 --> 01:08:49.789
That's the longest it has searched
the entire game, isn't it?


1299
01:08:49.813 --> 01:08:50.647
Yeah.

1300
01:08:50.731 --> 01:08:52.399
I think it's like it searched so deeply,

1301
01:08:52.483 --> 01:08:54.443
- it has lost itself.
- It's tired.


1302
01:08:55.486 --> 01:08:56.695
I do get the impression

1303
01:08:56.779 --> 01:08:59.114
that AlphaGo has sort of,
gone off on a tangent.


1304
01:08:59.198 --> 01:09:02.242
- What is it doing now?
- Well, maybe it has a master plan.


1305
01:09:02.326 --> 01:09:04.787
No, it doesn't even
think it has, does it?

1306
01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:08.499
So it knows it has made a mistake,
and it starts evaluating it the other way.


1307
01:09:08.999 --> 01:09:11.377
Look, look, Lee is confused.
He's like, "What is he doing?"


1308
01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:14.338
That's not a "I'm scared" confused,
that's a "What is it doing?"


1309
01:09:14.421 --> 01:09:15.672
What's going on?

1310
01:09:16.048 --> 01:09:17.549
You know, you asked
if it was a bug.

1311
01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:20.886
I've said before that if...

1312
01:09:20.969 --> 01:09:23.722
- Yeah, right. That's what I thought.
- If DeepMind has figured out


1313
01:09:23.806 --> 01:09:26.392
how to write code that doesn't have bugs,

1314
01:09:26.475 --> 01:09:28.769
that is a bigger news story than AlphaGo.

1315
01:09:28.852 --> 01:09:30.687
- Are you kidding me?
- Hm?


1316
01:09:30.771 --> 01:09:32.940
This... Literally, this next move
we are going to play,


1317
01:09:35.067 --> 01:09:37.945
I think they are going to laugh.
I think Lee is going to laugh.


1318
01:09:46.412 --> 01:09:47.746
Oh! Oh!

1319
01:09:47.830 --> 01:09:48.831
What is this?

1320
01:09:50.207 --> 01:09:52.042
- Oh, that's ridiculous!
- What's going on?


1321
01:09:52.126 --> 01:09:53.502
What is it thinking?

1322
01:09:53.836 --> 01:09:56.088
I don't really know what AlphaGo
is trying to do here.


1323
01:09:57.381 --> 01:09:59.049
That's the understatement of the year.

1324
01:09:59.550 --> 01:10:00.801
Is it a mouse misclick

1325
01:10:00.884 --> 01:10:02.594
- from Aja Huang?
- Nope, that's the move.


1326
01:10:02.678 --> 01:10:04.138
Aja Huang makes no misclicks.

1327
01:10:05.139 --> 01:10:06.765
Se-dol Lee is very confused.

1328
01:10:07.224 --> 01:10:08.851
These are not human moves.

1329
01:10:08.934 --> 01:10:12.438
This move is also sort of inexplicable.

1330
01:10:12.521 --> 01:10:15.858
I mean, those, you can clearly
call those mistakes.


1331
01:10:15.941 --> 01:10:16.859
Yes, of course.

1332
01:10:16.942 --> 01:10:19.111
But it's the first time
in the four matches


1333
01:10:19.194 --> 01:10:20.954
- that we have seen moves like that.
- Right.


1334
01:10:21.029 --> 01:10:22.823
Oh, the value dropped even more.

1335
01:10:23.615 --> 01:10:24.616
That's weird.

1336
01:10:25.451 --> 01:10:26.910
They're like 45%.

1337
01:10:28.954 --> 01:10:29.954
White.

1338
01:10:30.205 --> 01:10:32.458
- White.
- I think white is winning.


1339
01:10:32.541 --> 01:10:34.293
Come on, Se-dol Lee.

1340
01:10:34.376 --> 01:10:37.254
- It's unbelievable.
- Yeah, all right!


1341
01:10:37.337 --> 01:10:41.925
I was so confident that this black area
would just be consolidated by black,


1342
01:10:42.009 --> 01:10:43.135
and there was nothing there.

1343
01:10:43.218 --> 01:10:46.513
And somehow, he has just erased it all.
Like, it's gone.


1344
01:10:46.597 --> 01:10:47.973
So, he has found his weakness.

1345
01:10:48.056 --> 01:10:50.559
That wedge move probably surprised it.

1346
01:10:50.642 --> 01:10:51.977
- The wedge, yeah.
- Yeah.


1347
01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:54.605
AlphaGo seemed to have
such a good game, and then...


1348
01:10:54.688 --> 01:10:58.108
this whole sequence in the center
sort of changed that.


1349
01:10:58.192 --> 01:11:00.027
He pulls off a miracle.

1350
01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:01.987
He managed to make it so complicated

1351
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:05.574
that the artificial intelligence
doesn't evaluate it correctly.


1352
01:11:05.657 --> 01:11:08.285
I think it looks like Aja Huang
maybe, sitting there,


1353
01:11:08.368 --> 01:11:10.245
also knows that the game is over.

1354
01:11:10.662 --> 01:11:13.290
I can't... I can't stop smiling.

1355
01:11:13.832 --> 01:11:15.125
Did he smile?

1356
01:11:15.209 --> 01:11:16.877
No, I haven't seen him smile yet.

1357
01:11:17.336 --> 01:11:19.421
- I think he is still checking.
- He's so serious.


1358
01:11:19.505 --> 01:11:20.756
He's so serious.

1359
01:11:20.839 --> 01:11:23.091
- He wants to be careful.
- Yeah.


1360
01:11:23.175 --> 01:11:25.677
He's concerned a lot.

1361
01:11:25.761 --> 01:11:27.221
He really does his best.

1362
01:11:28.013 --> 01:11:30.474
I think he feels like
he has a sense of...

1363
01:11:31.183 --> 01:11:34.520
uh, responsibility, or burden.

1364
01:11:35.103 --> 01:11:36.772
I think it's almost over.

1365
01:11:37.439 --> 01:11:38.649
So, what's the percentage?

1366
01:11:38.732 --> 01:11:40.943
It shows as 18.2%.

1367
01:11:41.026 --> 01:11:42.945
The next move should be resign.

1368
01:11:47.115 --> 01:11:49.701
There you go. AlphaGo resigned.

1369
01:11:52.204 --> 01:11:54.456
- It looks like AlphaGo has resigned.
- Wow.


1370
01:11:55.582 --> 01:11:57.501
The most amazing game.

1371
01:11:59.211 --> 01:12:03.298
I'm almost going to tear up,
was, uh, Game Four...


1372
01:12:03.382 --> 01:12:05.884
um, where he comes back and wins, right?

1373
01:12:05.968 --> 01:12:07.302
It resigned!

1374
01:12:10.097 --> 01:12:11.682
I'm so happy!

1375
01:12:17.813 --> 01:12:20.148
I heard people shouting in joy

1376
01:12:20.232 --> 01:12:22.776
when it was clear that AlphaGo
had lost the game.


1377
01:12:23.277 --> 01:12:24.945
I think it is clear why.

1378
01:12:26.488 --> 01:12:28.657
People felt helplessness and fear.

1379
01:12:29.449 --> 01:12:32.452
It seemed like we humans
are so weak and fragile.


1380
01:12:33.495 --> 01:12:36.206
And this victory meant...

1381
01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:41.128
we could still hold our own.

1382
01:12:41.211 --> 01:12:44.131
As time goes on, it will probably be
very difficult to beat AI.


1383
01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:50.512
But winning this one time,
it felt like it was enough.


1384
01:12:51.597 --> 01:12:52.973
One time was enough.

1385
01:12:53.599 --> 01:12:55.976
I heard from so many people saying

1386
01:12:56.059 --> 01:12:58.604
they were running out in the street.

1387
01:12:58.687 --> 01:13:00.230
They were so happy.

1388
01:13:00.314 --> 01:13:02.441
They were chanting, they were celebrating.

1389
01:13:02.524 --> 01:13:05.402
Especially after zero-three down,

1390
01:13:05.777 --> 01:13:10.699
at the time, it seemed to be hopeless,
that the end of the world was coming,


1391
01:13:10.782 --> 01:13:11.950
but we saw the light.

1392
01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:13.744
Usually...

1393
01:13:13.827 --> 01:13:17.873
I'm happy when I win,
not when my colleague wins.


1394
01:13:18.457 --> 01:13:22.127
But, this time, it felt like my win.

1395
01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:24.630
I didn't want to make a move
which AlphaGo could predict.


1396
01:13:24.713 --> 01:13:25.756
This part...

1397
01:13:26.715 --> 01:13:29.426
It didn't anticipate this wedge move.

1398
01:13:30.385 --> 01:13:31.928
I won one game at least.

1399
01:13:32.971 --> 01:13:34.056
Good job today.

1400
01:14:02.501 --> 01:14:04.920
But I didn't expect it

1401
01:14:05.003 --> 01:14:06.380
to be like this.

1402
01:14:06.922 --> 01:14:09.049
I couldn't believe I won one game.

1403
01:14:09.132 --> 01:14:11.551
It was unbelievable.

1404
01:14:12.135 --> 01:14:13.220
Thank you very much.

1405
01:14:14.554 --> 01:14:18.225
I have never been congratulated so much
for winning one game.


1406
01:14:18.975 --> 01:14:22.729
After losing three games in a row,
I couldn't be happier.


1407
01:14:25.607 --> 01:14:30.320
This victory is so valuable
that I wouldn't exchange it


1408
01:14:30.404 --> 01:14:33.115
for anything in the world.

1409
01:14:33.573 --> 01:14:36.827
My question is about move number 78.

1410
01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:40.163
Chinese top Go player
Gu Li said that it was a god's play.


1411
01:14:40.247 --> 01:14:42.749
What were you thinking
when you made that play? Thank you.


1412
01:14:43.125 --> 01:14:45.419
At that point in the game,

1413
01:14:45.502 --> 01:14:48.380
move 78 was the
only move I could see.

1414
01:14:48.463 --> 01:14:50.841
There was no other placement.

1415
01:14:50.924 --> 01:14:53.844
It was the only option for me,
so I put it there.


1416
01:14:53.927 --> 01:14:57.597
I am quite humbled by all the praise
I am getting for it.


1417
01:14:58.473 --> 01:15:01.893
It does leave me a little bit
in awe of the human brain's power,


1418
01:15:01.977 --> 01:15:05.814
in particular, Lee's amazing ability
to cause AlphaGo problems


1419
01:15:05.897 --> 01:15:08.567
and find something
seemingly out of nothing.


1420
01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:10.819
And so, we really want
to understand what had happened.


1421
01:15:11.528 --> 01:15:13.321
So, it really was Lee's move?

1422
01:15:13.405 --> 01:15:14.406
The key is the center.

1423
01:15:14.489 --> 01:15:16.175
After the center got out,
there was no chance.


1424
01:15:16.199 --> 01:15:17.117
Come, come.

1425
01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.618
We were winning before this.

1426
01:15:19.327 --> 01:15:20.912
But if AlphaGo thought it was winning

1427
01:15:20.996 --> 01:15:24.249
and it couldn't convert that win,
that means it wasn't actually winning.


1428
01:15:24.332 --> 01:15:26.185
Otherwise, it would have had
the right responses.


1429
01:15:26.209 --> 01:15:27.335
Would we have played it?

1430
01:15:27.419 --> 01:15:28.587
Nerves of steel in there.

1431
01:15:28.670 --> 01:15:30.422
What probability does it give it as white?

1432
01:15:33.675 --> 01:15:36.762
It's 0.007% of...

1433
01:15:36.845 --> 01:15:38.513
Is that in the position that he played?

1434
01:15:38.597 --> 01:15:39.866
- That's when he played it.
- I see.


1435
01:15:39.890 --> 01:15:42.201
- We thought this was a 1-in-10,000 move.
- I know it was like...


1436
01:15:42.225 --> 01:15:43.865
- Yeah.
- The values we didn't know about.


1437
01:15:45.729 --> 01:15:48.815
- So the god move was literally a god move,
- Yeah.


1438
01:15:48.899 --> 01:15:51.610
because we believe
that only one in 10,000 humans


1439
01:15:51.693 --> 01:15:53.296
- would have found that move.
- That's right.


1440
01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:55.614
It doesn't come to
mind as the top five...

1441
01:15:55.697 --> 01:15:58.033
in the top five moves
that you would consider.


1442
01:15:58.116 --> 01:16:00.136
Unless you're Se-dol Lee,
he said it was the only move.


1443
01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:03.121
He thought it was the only move.
Yeah, remarkable, isn't it?


1444
01:16:06.875 --> 01:16:09.044
Welcome back to the Four Seasons.

1445
01:16:09.127 --> 01:16:10.962
World Champion Se-dol Lee

1446
01:16:11.046 --> 01:16:16.343
went looking for AlphaGo's weakness
in Game Four, and he found it.


1447
01:16:16.426 --> 01:16:20.972
Today, last round, he is looking to see
if he can repeat that.


1448
01:16:21.056 --> 01:16:22.224
We will see what happens.

1449
01:16:22.307 --> 01:16:23.934
The place
is a madhouse downstairs.


1450
01:16:24.017 --> 01:16:26.812
Maybe as many, if not more,
journalists here today


1451
01:16:26.895 --> 01:16:28.814
than there were for Game One.

1452
01:16:30.023 --> 01:16:32.484
We were really excited
for the fifth match,


1453
01:16:32.567 --> 01:16:33.735
to see what would happen.

1454
01:16:33.819 --> 01:16:37.072
Was this going to be a three-two thing
or was it going to be a four-one thing?


1455
01:16:37.155 --> 01:16:40.033
And, you know, there's a different message
with both of those.


1456
01:16:41.243 --> 01:16:44.663
For me, I don't think
AlphaGo will make the mistake again.


1457
01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:46.706
But who knows.

1458
01:16:47.541 --> 01:16:48.667
Maybe it will happen again.

1459
01:16:49.376 --> 01:16:53.296
And Se-dol Lee now have more confidence
about this.


1460
01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:58.969
It looks like, maybe, Se-dol Lee has
found the key in solving AlphaGo.


1461
01:16:59.594 --> 01:17:00.637
Oh, this works!

1462
01:17:03.265 --> 01:17:06.476
Is it fair to say
that AlphaGo made a mistake?


1463
01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:08.000
We might have another victory today.

1464
01:17:08.061 --> 01:17:11.314
You weren't crazy
about the timing on this move.


1465
01:17:11.398 --> 01:17:14.401
- Yeah.
- And now, you don't approve of this.


1466
01:17:15.068 --> 01:17:17.529
Yeah, I'm sort of thinking
that maybe AlphaGo


1467
01:17:17.612 --> 01:17:19.739
hasn't recovered from Game Four yet. Yeah.

1468
01:17:20.282 --> 01:17:21.366
Still deluded?

1469
01:17:22.075 --> 01:17:23.201
We don't know.

1470
01:17:23.743 --> 01:17:24.870
Oh, no, I hope he doesn't...

1471
01:17:24.953 --> 01:17:27.122
No, no, he needs to play the...

1472
01:17:29.666 --> 01:17:31.918
He played some moves.

1473
01:17:32.002 --> 01:17:33.003
It was a bad move.

1474
01:17:33.086 --> 01:17:34.087
I felt something.

1475
01:17:34.170 --> 01:17:37.007
Oh, maybe his weakness
has come back again.


1476
01:17:37.132 --> 01:17:40.093
Are we seeing
another short circuit?


1477
01:17:40.176 --> 01:17:42.304
Or is there something, what's...

1478
01:17:42.387 --> 01:17:44.347
I think it could be
a kind of a misreading.


1479
01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:46.474
And we are...

1480
01:17:46.558 --> 01:17:48.318
You're pretty comfortable
with saying that...


1481
01:17:48.351 --> 01:17:50.061
That it is looking good
for Se-dol Lee?


1482
01:17:50.145 --> 01:17:51.646
It's looking good for Se-dol Lee.

1483
01:17:54.274 --> 01:17:55.650
What is he playing in there for?

1484
01:17:55.734 --> 01:17:58.236
There's no reason for white
to be playing that move.


1485
01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.696
It's a bad move.

1486
01:17:59.779 --> 01:18:02.616
And in some cases,
it's going to lose a point, too.


1487
01:18:02.699 --> 01:18:04.826
It is exactly the same thing.

1488
01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:06.369
It's 91% certain now.

1489
01:18:06.453 --> 01:18:08.455
Someone was telling me
that maybe it had...


1490
01:18:08.538 --> 01:18:10.498
Yeah, because it's incorrect again.

1491
01:18:12.208 --> 01:18:13.877
The whole game,
we thought that AlphaGo


1492
01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.360
was wrong about the board position.

1493
01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:18.423
We were super worried that,
"Oh, it's going to play garbage.


1494
01:18:18.506 --> 01:18:20.675
It's going to be like lose
in a very embarrassing way."


1495
01:18:20.759 --> 01:18:22.719
And this continued for the whole game.

1496
01:18:23.553 --> 01:18:24.554
This is a bit weird.

1497
01:18:25.388 --> 01:18:26.806
- When did it play that?
- Just now.


1498
01:18:26.890 --> 01:18:29.327
- So I don't know. I mean, it doesn't...
- Well, that we don't know.


1499
01:18:29.351 --> 01:18:31.412
But we're not good enough
Go players to know that, right?


1500
01:18:31.436 --> 01:18:32.270
Yeah.

1501
01:18:32.354 --> 01:18:34.856
As it turns out,
none of us know Go well enough


1502
01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:37.150
to accurately judge what AlphaGo is doing.

1503
01:18:37.233 --> 01:18:38.610
The white is winning now.

1504
01:18:38.693 --> 01:18:40.173
This one looks like white is winning.

1505
01:18:41.363 --> 01:18:42.238
Ah!

1506
01:18:42.322 --> 01:18:47.118
We all say some of AlphaGo's moves
are so weird and strange,


1507
01:18:47.202 --> 01:18:48.620
and may be mistakes.

1508
01:18:48.912 --> 01:18:52.207
But after a game is finished,

1509
01:18:52.290 --> 01:18:56.378
we have to doubt ourselves, our judgment.

1510
01:18:56.461 --> 01:18:59.631
AlphaGo making another
kind of nonsensical throw-in.


1511
01:19:00.215 --> 01:19:01.609
I'm not really sure what that's about.

1512
01:19:01.633 --> 01:19:04.177
This is what 10
or maybe 11-dan play looks like.


1513
01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:06.930
It looks weird,
and we don't quite understand it.


1514
01:19:07.013 --> 01:19:10.475
I think it's important to study more

1515
01:19:10.558 --> 01:19:14.062
about AlphaGo's mistake-like moves.

1516
01:19:14.145 --> 01:19:18.108
Then maybe we can adjust
our knowledge about Go.


1517
01:19:18.191 --> 01:19:21.903
To me, the most amazing thing
to come out of my understanding of Go


1518
01:19:21.987 --> 01:19:23.613
as a result of watching AlphaGo play

1519
01:19:23.697 --> 01:19:26.282
are the infamous "slack moves."

1520
01:19:26.366 --> 01:19:27.701
Well, there's something strange

1521
01:19:27.784 --> 01:19:29.327
- about the way it is playing,
- Yeah.


1522
01:19:29.411 --> 01:19:32.288
because it's playing some moves
that are not really necessary.


1523
01:19:32.372 --> 01:19:33.206
Right.

1524
01:19:33.289 --> 01:19:36.292
A "slack move" is a move
that looks lazy.


1525
01:19:36.376 --> 01:19:40.130
You can see these other better moves,
and AlphaGo is rejecting them.


1526
01:19:40.213 --> 01:19:43.550
But, what I think AlphaGo is teaching us

1527
01:19:43.633 --> 01:19:49.764
is that we have been using score
as a proxy for chance of winning.


1528
01:19:49.848 --> 01:19:52.851
So the bigger my margin of territory,

1529
01:19:52.934 --> 01:19:54.936
the more confident I am
that I'm going to win.


1530
01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:56.646
And AlphaGo is saying, "No, no, no.

1531
01:19:56.730 --> 01:19:58.481
It shouldn't matter how much you win by,

1532
01:19:58.565 --> 01:20:00.692
you only need to
win by a single point.

1533
01:20:00.775 --> 01:20:03.695
Why should I be seizing all this
extra territory when I don't need it?"


1534
01:20:03.778 --> 01:20:06.156
The lessons that AlphaGo is teaching us

1535
01:20:06.239 --> 01:20:11.828
are going to influence how Go is played
for the next thousand years.


1536
01:20:12.328 --> 01:20:14.748
By my counting, white won this game.

1537
01:20:14.831 --> 01:20:17.792
How... By how much?
Are we talking two points?


1538
01:20:17.876 --> 01:20:19.794
- One-and-a-half.
- One-and-a-half points.


1539
01:20:20.211 --> 01:20:22.422
One-and-a-half. Maybe half,
one-and-a-half.


1540
01:20:22.505 --> 01:20:25.967
Of course, Go is just a game,
but we can learn important lessons


1541
01:20:26.051 --> 01:20:28.803
from a computer being so successful at Go.

1542
01:20:28.887 --> 01:20:32.140
Machines will have the capability
not only to crunch


1543
01:20:32.223 --> 01:20:36.561
through a huge amount of data,
but also to analyze it intelligently.


1544
01:20:36.895 --> 01:20:39.481
Just as in the
case of the Go games,

1545
01:20:39.564 --> 01:20:42.942
the machine made moves
that surprised even the experts.


1546
01:20:43.026 --> 01:20:45.695
And, eventually, the machines
will gain our confidence


1547
01:20:45.779 --> 01:20:47.989
because we will see that very, very often

1548
01:20:48.073 --> 01:20:51.076
they make a better guess
than we could have made as humans.


1549
01:20:54.079 --> 01:20:55.914
AlphaGo has strong foundation.

1550
01:21:01.878 --> 01:21:03.379
What surprised me the most was...

1551
01:21:03.838 --> 01:21:05.590
that AlphaGo showed us

1552
01:21:05.673 --> 01:21:09.302
that moves humans may have thought
are creative, were actually conventional.


1553
01:21:10.011 --> 01:21:15.058
I think this will bring
a new paradigm to Go.


1554
01:21:15.141 --> 01:21:18.478
AlphaGo won this area as well? Oh, god.

1555
01:21:18.561 --> 01:21:22.774
- That makes me very uncomfortable.
- Oh!


1556
01:21:22.857 --> 01:21:25.318
Unfortunately, for Se-dol Lee,

1557
01:21:25.401 --> 01:21:27.654
I think white might have
a slight advantage here.


1558
01:21:27.737 --> 01:21:30.406
White lights up in places,
but if we count it like that, it's 1.5.


1559
01:21:30.490 --> 01:21:32.117
They keep saying
one-and-a-half points.


1560
01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.035
How do you know the Korean room
has called it?


1561
01:21:34.119 --> 01:21:35.662
Someone, um...

1562
01:21:36.246 --> 01:21:38.331
- Who told us the Koreans called it?
- I don't know.


1563
01:21:38.414 --> 01:21:40.166
The Koreans told you?

1564
01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:41.250
Koreans called it.

1565
01:21:41.292 --> 01:21:44.254
The Korean room
has called it for AlphaGo.


1566
01:21:44.337 --> 01:21:47.590
We would just like to know
if someone Korean in there can find out.


1567
01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:51.136
The Korean room
think AlphaGo is winning.


1568
01:21:51.845 --> 01:21:53.471
"Winning," okay, not... then not won.

1569
01:21:53.555 --> 01:21:54.782
- That's what she said.
- "Winning."


1570
01:21:54.806 --> 01:21:56.246
She said they called it right there.

1571
01:22:01.729 --> 01:22:03.398
AlphaGo is saying it's going to resign.

1572
01:22:03.481 --> 01:22:04.899
- What...
- No. I'm only joking.


1573
01:22:06.568 --> 01:22:08.444
Jesus, I almost had a heart attack.

1574
01:22:09.028 --> 01:22:10.697
That is ridiculous.

1575
01:22:11.447 --> 01:22:13.575
That was very good.

1576
01:22:13.658 --> 01:22:14.993
- Well played.
- Yeah.


1577
01:22:15.076 --> 01:22:16.369
- Well played.
- No, not really.


1578
01:22:16.452 --> 01:22:19.539
I couldn't do it for too long.
I just couldn't think like that.


1579
01:22:19.622 --> 01:22:21.666
David, you've been waiting
two years to do that.


1580
01:22:21.749 --> 01:22:23.918
He needs to do that.

1581
01:22:24.002 --> 01:22:26.546
We don't know the score.
We have no idea what's going on, right?


1582
01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:28.590
Two-and-a-half points.

1583
01:22:28.673 --> 01:22:30.473
Lee is two-and-a-half points behind,
at least.


1584
01:22:31.718 --> 01:22:33.428
The parting in the center,

1585
01:22:33.511 --> 01:22:35.346
it's very hard to... 
It's very hard to...

1586
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:38.349
Lee is touching the bowl.

1587
01:22:38.433 --> 01:22:40.226
It looks like
he's considering resigning.


1588
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:42.228
Yes.
I think he is thinking of resigning.


1589
01:22:53.406 --> 01:22:54.741
- Did he resign?
- He resigned.


1590
01:22:54.824 --> 01:22:56.284
Hm? He has what?

1591
01:22:56.367 --> 01:22:57.785
I think he resigned.

1592
01:22:57.869 --> 01:23:00.747
- He resigned?
- I think he resigned. Look.


1593
01:23:02.081 --> 01:23:04.042
- He's moved everything in there.
- What?


1594
01:23:04.125 --> 01:23:05.126
He played the white.

1595
01:23:05.210 --> 01:23:06.377
Aja is looking relaxed.

1596
01:23:06.461 --> 01:23:08.296
- Yeah, he has resigned.
- He has resigned.


1597
01:23:08.379 --> 01:23:09.505
Yes, he is giving up.

1598
01:23:09.589 --> 01:23:12.091
- Okay. That's it. He has given up.
- Yeah.


1599
01:23:13.301 --> 01:23:15.136
- Yeah!
- Yes!


1600
01:23:23.853 --> 01:23:27.690
I mean, I think it just really
is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.


1601
01:23:28.107 --> 01:23:31.819
I would say it is the most amazing thing,
you know, I have experienced.


1602
01:23:32.528 --> 01:23:34.989
You know, for us, it is the culmination
of a 20-year dream.


1603
01:23:35.573 --> 01:23:39.285
It started as a pure research endeavor.

1604
01:23:39.369 --> 01:23:42.580
We just wanted to understand.
Can neural networks play the game of Go?


1605
01:23:42.664 --> 01:23:48.211
And from there, it went on
to a level that I never expected.


1606
01:23:48.711 --> 01:23:51.798
And, I'm unbelievably proud
of the team.


1607
01:23:53.174 --> 01:23:55.385
When I started doing
artificial intelligence,


1608
01:23:55.468 --> 01:23:57.929
it was four or five years ago,

1609
01:23:58.012 --> 01:23:59.847
and I was really interested in that,

1610
01:23:59.931 --> 01:24:01.808
but, like, many people
would discourage me,


1611
01:24:01.891 --> 01:24:03.893
and they would say,
okay, there is no future.


1612
01:24:03.977 --> 01:24:07.355
So, actually seeing that within five years

1613
01:24:07.438 --> 01:24:09.399
we are at this stage right now,

1614
01:24:09.524 --> 01:24:11.025
it's amazing by itself.

1615
01:24:11.109 --> 01:24:12.986
Everybody say, "Nine dan."

1616
01:24:13.069 --> 01:24:14.320
- Nine dan!
- Nine dan!


1617
01:24:14.404 --> 01:24:15.530
Kimchi!

1618
01:24:16.281 --> 01:24:18.658
There are so many
possible application domains


1619
01:24:18.741 --> 01:24:22.996
where creativity, in a different dimension
to what humans could do,


1620
01:24:23.079 --> 01:24:24.706
could be immensely valuable to us.

1621
01:24:25.123 --> 01:24:26.883
And I just love to have more
of those moments


1622
01:24:26.958 --> 01:24:30.044
where we look back and say,
"Yeah, that was just like move 37.


1623
01:24:30.128 --> 01:24:32.130
Something beautiful occurred there."

1624
01:24:32.422 --> 01:24:36.092
At least in a broad sense,
move 37 begat move 78,


1625
01:24:36.175 --> 01:24:41.014
begat a new attitude in Se-dol Lee,
a new way of seeing the game.


1626
01:24:42.015 --> 01:24:45.393
He improved through this machine.

1627
01:24:45.893 --> 01:24:51.441
His humanness was expanded
after playing this inanimate creation.


1628
01:24:51.524 --> 01:24:53.985
And the hope is that, that machine,

1629
01:24:54.068 --> 01:24:56.154
and in particular,
the technology behind it,


1630
01:24:56.237 --> 01:24:58.865
can have the same
effect with all of us.

1631
01:25:00.408 --> 01:25:03.953
I remember hearing a talk
by Kasparov, who says that, uh,


1632
01:25:04.037 --> 01:25:08.041
a good human plus a machine
is the best combination.


1633
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:12.086
This is a unique experience.

1634
01:25:13.212 --> 01:25:15.089
Nobody can have this experience

1635
01:25:15.173 --> 01:25:17.216
playing with AlphaGo,
five games like this.


1636
01:25:17.633 --> 01:25:23.181
So, I hope Se-dol Lee can find
something in these five games.


1637
01:25:23.264 --> 01:25:25.516
Maybe some change in his game.

1638
01:25:26.476 --> 01:25:29.270
I saw today how he continuously fought.

1639
01:25:29.812 --> 01:25:30.813
SE
-DOL LEE

1640
01:25:30.897 --> 01:25:32.065
He's very good,

1641
01:25:32.148 --> 01:25:34.400
a master, a really great master.

1642
01:25:36.319 --> 01:25:37.987
I have grown

1643
01:25:38.071 --> 01:25:39.864
through this experience.

1644
01:25:39.947 --> 01:25:45.119
I will make something out of it
with the lessons I have learned.


1645
01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:50.124
I feel thankful and feel like

1646
01:25:50.708 --> 01:25:54.837
I have found the reason I play Go.

1647
01:25:54.921 --> 01:25:59.300
I realize it was really a good choice,
learning to play Go.


1648
01:26:00.468 --> 01:26:06.724
It has been an unforgettable experience.

1649
01:26:09.811 --> 01:26:11.646
This event is done,

1650
01:26:11.729 --> 01:26:15.066
but for the story,
maybe, it's just beginning.


1651
01:26:15.149 --> 01:26:16.149
We don't know.

1652
01:26:20.196 --> 01:26:23.241
It's just when I played with AlphaGo,
he showed me something.


1653
01:26:23.491 --> 01:26:25.701
I felt something beautiful. That was it.

1654
01:26:26.953 --> 01:26:31.207
I saw the world differently,
before everything began.


1655
01:26:32.667 --> 01:26:35.962
What is really behind the game of Go?

1656
01:26:36.754 --> 01:26:39.841
What that is, it can change my game.

1657
01:26:43.428 --> 01:26:47.306
Maybe it can just show humans
something we have never discovered.


1658
01:26:49.058 --> 01:26:50.935
Maybe, there is beauty.
