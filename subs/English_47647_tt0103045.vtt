1
00:04:18.268 --> 00:04:19.895
Understand?!

2
00:04:32.181 --> 00:04:34.911
What are you doing?

3
00:04:35.084 --> 00:04:35.846
Don't know.

4
00:04:36.019 --> 00:04:38.783
Don't know? I've made it clear.

5
00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.723
Scatter, scatter.

6
00:06:39.175 --> 00:06:41.040
Help, help.

7
00:06:46.482 --> 00:06:48.814
You're smart, why are you so smart?

8
00:06:49.185 --> 00:06:50.618
Don't go too close.

9
00:06:54.857 --> 00:06:56.256
Hey.

10
00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:57.321
Dead?

11
00:06:57.493 --> 00:06:59.188
Yes, dead already.

12
00:07:05.134 --> 00:07:05.998
Sir.

13
00:07:06.235 --> 00:07:07.259
Sir.

14
00:07:09.505 --> 00:07:11.496
The Mission has been completed smoothly.

15
00:07:11.674 --> 00:07:13.301
Star Chow, where're your men?

16
00:07:21.484 --> 00:07:22.883
All dead!?

17
00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:26.221
We want a supervisor, we want team work.

18
00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:29.251
Not going alone like Rambo.

19
00:07:30.693 --> 00:07:33.184
The hostages have been rescued.

20
00:07:33.996 --> 00:07:36.726
Rescuing is just an item in this exam.

21
00:07:37.133 --> 00:07:39.863
What matters most is
the safety of your juniors

22
00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:43.163
and your leadership but I can't see anything!

23
00:07:50.713 --> 00:07:52.681
Sir, give me a chance.

24
00:07:52.849 --> 00:07:54.077
What are you doing?

25
00:07:55.518 --> 00:07:56.348
What are you doing?

26
00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:57.850
Don't!

27
00:07:58.087 --> 00:08:01.147
Sir, could you please reconsider?

28
00:08:04.293 --> 00:08:05.317
Who is it?

29
00:08:06.162 --> 00:08:07.129
Yes.

30
00:08:08.231 --> 00:08:11.598
Yes, Sir. The boss wants to see you.

31
00:08:12.001 --> 00:08:13.434
Yes, Sir.

32
00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:27.145
Good morning, Sir, 
I'm Star Chow.

33
00:08:34.991 --> 00:08:38.927
Damn it, that adorable!

34
00:08:41.097 --> 00:08:44.828
Turn a round for me,
don't be shy, come on!


35
00:08:52.942 --> 00:08:55.410
Irresistible, I'm sorry.

36
00:08:56.979 --> 00:08:58.640
Wanna get a promotion?

37
00:08:58.881 --> 00:09:00.405
I don't want to be a gigolo, Sir.

38
00:09:00.783 --> 00:09:02.250
I asked if you want a promotion.

39
00:09:02.418 --> 00:09:04.147
I won't be gigolo, Sir.

40
00:09:04.887 --> 00:09:08.721
That's nonsense!
I asked if you want a promotion.


41
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:17.260
Yes, but not at
the cost of my chastity.

42
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.566
Who wants your chastity?
I want your youth.


43
00:09:21.737 --> 00:09:24.638
Youth and chastity are equally important
to me.


44
00:09:24.941 --> 00:09:28.172
Fine, fine, I see. 
Let me finish my words.

45
00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:30.342
This matter is such,

46
00:09:31.213 --> 00:09:33.807
one day, some students visited
our police station.


47
00:09:34.684 --> 00:09:38.552
A pistol was lost afterwards.

48
00:09:39.455 --> 00:09:41.855
Sir, we lose pistols very often.

49
00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:44.858
But that pistol is mine!

50
00:09:45.895 --> 00:09:47.624
I can share your heartbreaking feeling.

51
00:09:48.097 --> 00:09:52.329
Yes, that pistol has followed me
for 30 years.


52
00:09:52.935 --> 00:09:57.201
I've never shot it. 
It's for scratching itches.

53
00:09:58.608 --> 00:10:02.567
Speaking of the itch and here comes.
Scratch me.


54
00:10:04.313 --> 00:10:06.110
- The back?
- Yes.


55
00:10:07.717 --> 00:10:09.947
It's a kind pistol.

56
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.512
Can pistol be kind?

57
00:10:12.888 --> 00:10:18.087
It's got a kind nature.
If it falls in the hands of bad students,


58
00:10:19.061 --> 00:10:22.861
tragedies will follow.

59
00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:25.224
Don't worry, Sir.

60
00:10:25.401 --> 00:10:26.766
I'll search the whole school

61
00:10:26.936 --> 00:10:28.767
for your pistol.

62
00:10:29.772 --> 00:10:31.672
If I can manage, 
I don't have to ask you.

63
00:10:32.141 --> 00:10:35.542
I'm retiring, but I've lost my pistol.

64
00:10:35.711 --> 00:10:37.838
I'll lose my face if others know.

65
00:10:40.249 --> 00:10:44.083
So I want you to
enter that school as a spy.

66
00:10:46.322 --> 00:10:48.552
I'm not sure if I can teach.

67
00:10:48.724 --> 00:10:50.419
Who ask you to teach? 
To be a student!

68
00:10:50.593 --> 00:10:51.924
Student?

69
00:10:53.396 --> 00:10:56.456
I joined the police force
because I hated studying.


70
00:10:56.666 --> 00:11:01.968
I can't be a student. 
Sir, if you do so...

71
00:11:02.138 --> 00:11:05.767
you're bringing me to a volcano
with lots of wild animals


72
00:11:06.308 --> 00:11:08.868
and paying no attention to my wailing.

73
00:11:09.045 --> 00:11:12.776
And are just kicking me cruelly...

74
00:11:15.051 --> 00:11:18.111
into the exploding volcano.

75
00:11:19.789 --> 00:11:21.723
How can you be so cruel?

76
00:11:21.924 --> 00:11:25.018
You can live and die excitingly then.

77
00:11:25.628 --> 00:11:27.493
Stop, no way escaping.

78
00:11:29.965 --> 00:11:32.297
Here's a pager watch, put it on.

79
00:11:32.468 --> 00:11:34.527
666 means I call you.

80
00:11:39.675 --> 00:11:42.337
Say to me, "Good morning, sir".

81
00:11:43.979 --> 00:11:48.439
Good... morning... sir.

82
00:11:48.918 --> 00:11:50.044
Very good.

83
00:11:50.286 --> 00:11:52.880
Don't let others know
or both you and I'll be in trouble.


84
00:12:55.885 --> 00:12:57.443
I'll see if you
guys will be late again.

85
00:13:01.056 --> 00:13:02.216
What are you staring at?

86
00:13:12.134 --> 00:13:16.298
School Discipline

87
00:13:19.742 --> 00:13:23.473
You'll learn it by heart later.

88
00:13:29.852 --> 00:13:30.944
That's the fresh boy.

89
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.644
Big stupid guy, from which class?

90
00:13:32.822 --> 00:13:33.481
Could it be ours?

91
00:13:33.656 --> 00:13:34.816
I don't think so.

92
00:13:58.314 --> 00:14:05.743
Star Chow, I'm the Head of Discipline
of this school. My name is Lam.


93
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:28.601
A mosquito.

94
00:14:29.845 --> 00:14:31.472
You transferred from England College?

95
00:14:32.181 --> 00:14:34.479
Students from that school are rubbish.

96
00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:37.585
I don't care what's between your family
and the school committee.


97
00:14:38.721 --> 00:14:42.487
Edinburgh College is a prestigious school
and teach the best students.


98
00:14:43.225 --> 00:14:45.352
I can't stand a single bad element

99
00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:49.192
or I'll kick you out of here,

100
00:14:49.565 --> 00:14:50.589
clear?

101
00:14:50.866 --> 00:14:52.060
Yes, Sir!

102
00:14:53.836 --> 00:14:57.328
You think that's interesting?
Bring him to the classroom.


103
00:14:58.407 --> 00:14:59.601
Come with me to the classroom.

104
00:15:13.923 --> 00:15:15.481
Around 1987,

105
00:15:16.058 --> 00:15:18.891
an observation from the sky
above the South Pole...


106
00:15:19.795 --> 00:15:23.287
revealed that there's hole
at the ozonosphere up above there.


107
00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:27.560
Strong ultraviolet ray is harmful
to living organisms.


108
00:15:28.237 --> 00:15:32.435
A less serious situation will affect the genes.

109
00:15:33.442 --> 00:15:36.070
The worst case will kill the cells.

110
00:15:36.812 --> 00:15:38.541
Plants will die as a result.

111
00:15:39.548 --> 00:15:42.540
Ultraviolet ray can penetrate into the sea.

112
00:15:45.554 --> 00:15:55.554
I lose freedom,
my heart's breaking my tears' flowing.


113
00:15:58.267 --> 00:16:08.267
I've lost my way and gone astray.
My heart is breaking.


114
00:16:14.183 --> 00:16:14.672
Who's attacking the police?

115
00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:17.011
Attacking what?

116
00:16:17.586 --> 00:16:20.180
You! Take the duster out.

117
00:16:30.065 --> 00:16:31.999
I don't care you're new in here.

118
00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:36.231
What are you dreaming? What?

119
00:16:38.507 --> 00:16:42.341
Miss has got her pride.
The lesson restarts!


120
00:16:42.845 --> 00:16:45.439
Let's start with the atmosphere layer.

121
00:16:46.382 --> 00:16:48.350
The atmosphere is made up of several layers.

122
00:16:48.517 --> 00:16:49.279
Calm down, everything will go very smoothly.

123
00:16:49.451 --> 00:16:50.645
Step aside, everything can be as boundless as
the sea and sky


124
00:16:50.819 --> 00:16:53.686
The layer nearest to the earth is called
the troposphere.


125
00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:59.050
It's 15,000 to 50,000 feet above the earth.

126
00:16:59.395 --> 00:17:01.625
It contains cloud and weather systems.

127
00:17:28.257 --> 00:17:30.225
Ming Dynasty 
- Punishment

128
00:17:30.826 --> 00:17:34.023
The Ming Dynasty particularly
stressed on punishment.


129
00:17:34.863 --> 00:17:40.802
Disrespect Party politics and espionage
were subjects to punishment.


130
00:17:41.437 --> 00:17:42.301
Turtle Wong.

131
00:17:42.471 --> 00:17:45.167
Mr. Cheng what does it mean by espionage?

132
00:17:45.407 --> 00:17:47.534
It's the current practice of spying.

133
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.078
The people involved are called spies.

134
00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.674
These people are punished by castration.

135
00:17:54.049 --> 00:17:55.107
Castration!?

136
00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:57.346
Chopping sex organ, kid.

137
00:17:59.254 --> 00:18:00.221
Chopped by how many inches?

138
00:18:00.389 --> 00:18:01.788
That depends on how many inches you've got.

139
00:18:34.389 --> 00:18:36.857
The wrong book again, absent-minded!

140
00:18:46.101 --> 00:18:47.432
Really absent-minded!

141
00:18:51.907 --> 00:18:52.931
What's that noise?

142
00:19:10.125 --> 00:19:14.357
Thank you for your help.

143
00:19:14.596 --> 00:19:16.962
Come... Quicker...

144
00:19:20.135 --> 00:19:21.363
Serve him right.

145
00:19:22.304 --> 00:19:25.637
You're laughing so happily you come out too.

146
00:19:29.945 --> 00:19:31.139
Come...

147
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:36.208
What's your name?

148
00:19:36.852 --> 00:19:37.876
Star Chow.

149
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.744
And you?

150
00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:41.215
Turtle Wong.

151
00:19:42.591 --> 00:19:43.853
What's your name?

152
00:19:45.127 --> 00:19:46.287
Star Chow.

153
00:19:47.262 --> 00:19:48.251
What's yours?

154
00:19:49.331 --> 00:19:50.593
Turtle Wong.

155
00:19:57.039 --> 00:19:59.064
What's your name?

156
00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:02.903
Star Chow.

157
00:20:06.114 --> 00:20:07.775
Let's begin, Star Chow.

158
00:20:10.185 --> 00:20:13.086
This experiment is quite complicated.

159
00:20:14.056 --> 00:20:16.251
We must remember each step.

160
00:20:16.992 --> 00:20:19.620
Forgetting one single step
will be very dangerous.


161
00:20:20.429 --> 00:20:23.557
Sorry...
the most important thing of this experiment is...


162
00:20:23.732 --> 00:20:24.994
Memory.

163
00:20:25.234 --> 00:20:26.826
If not, it'll...

164
00:20:27.002 --> 00:20:28.299
will be very dangerous.

165
00:21:16.752 --> 00:21:17.980
Stop!

166
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.129
Hey... get back down here

167
00:21:28.297 --> 00:21:29.787
Hey, you, go away

168
00:21:31.199 --> 00:21:32.359
Please, could you get down here first?

169
00:21:32.534 --> 00:21:34.525
What are you doing? Who are you?
What's this to do with you?


170
00:21:34.703 --> 00:21:36.466
Excuse me and you get down.

171
00:21:36.638 --> 00:21:38.071
Why pulling me down here?

172
00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.003
You're standing on my belly.

173
00:21:42.311 --> 00:21:44.711
Don't go away, we're on the same boat,
we share the same code.


174
00:21:45.547 --> 00:21:46.605
Code!?

175
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.979
Chicken, turtle, bone, boil, spoon.

176
00:21:50.218 --> 00:21:50.980
What's the code?

177
00:21:51.153 --> 00:21:52.643
Chicken, turtle, bone, boil, spoon.

178
00:21:52.821 --> 00:21:54.652
- What's this?
- The code!


179
00:21:55.557 --> 00:21:58.185
God! Everybody's abnormal here,
excuse me.


180
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.021
You can't climb out from here.

181
00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:01.162
You can't walk out from here.

182
00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:03.264
OK, I'll use the front door.

183
00:22:03.765 --> 00:22:04.697
Not even with the front door.

184
00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:05.730
What's it?

185
00:22:05.901 --> 00:22:07.994
Nothing, this boy's gone mad suddenly.

186
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:09.899
Yes, I've gone mad. I want home.

187
00:22:10.238 --> 00:22:11.000
What is it?

188
00:22:11.173 --> 00:22:12.140
Sorry, Sir.

189
00:22:12.841 --> 00:22:14.001
Don't block my way, please.

190
00:22:14.643 --> 00:22:15.667
Excuse me, please.

191
00:22:20.148 --> 00:22:22.639
Excuse me, I want to go.

192
00:22:23.018 --> 00:22:24.076
Are you alright?

193
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.621
I'm sick, I want to go home.

194
00:22:27.923 --> 00:22:30.585
Please let me go! Thank you.

195
00:22:30.759 --> 00:22:31.691
You're not feeling well.

196
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.519
Yes.

197
00:22:32.694 --> 00:22:33.820
Come with me.

198
00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:39.266
Let's see if you've got a fever.

199
00:22:43.205 --> 00:22:44.229
No.

200
00:22:46.041 --> 00:22:47.008
Yes.

201
00:22:47.442 --> 00:22:49.501
No, look at it yourself.

202
00:22:51.413 --> 00:22:54.314
It's me who's got
the fever, not the thermometer.

203
00:22:54.483 --> 00:22:56.917
I'm feeling so bad.

204
00:22:57.352 --> 00:22:59.047
Let me see your eyes.

205
00:23:00.322 --> 00:23:01.311
Look down.

206
00:23:02.491 --> 00:23:03.583
Look up.

207
00:23:05.093 --> 00:23:06.151
Look at the left.

208
00:23:07.796 --> 00:23:09.957
Hey, your eyeballs can't move?

209
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.858
It can't move since I've got a fever.

210
00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.403
Are you pretending?

211
00:23:17.439 --> 00:23:20.033
I'm Miss Ho, I'm not teaching your class,

212
00:23:20.242 --> 00:23:22.039
but I'm the counselor of your class.

213
00:23:22.377 --> 00:23:23.742
You go back to classroom first.

214
00:23:24.312 --> 00:23:28.146
Come to me anytime if
you've got problem. Be good.

215
00:23:30.819 --> 00:23:33.720
Are you mad just because I've dropped
your pencil-case unintentionally?


216
00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.154
No, I ain't, ain't.

217
00:23:37.325 --> 00:23:38.758
I'm so frightened.

218
00:23:39.628 --> 00:23:41.255
So, how much do you want?

219
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.398
That depends...

220
00:23:47.335 --> 00:23:48.324
Only $300.

221
00:23:48.503 --> 00:23:49.834
I'm not frightened now.

222
00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:56.639
If I know you
still got money with you,

223
00:23:56.878 --> 00:23:59.108
I'll not throw your pencil case away,
but you!


224
00:23:59.748 --> 00:24:00.680
I understood.

225
00:24:29.177 --> 00:24:30.940
Good, the savior comes.

226
00:24:32.948 --> 00:24:35.314
Don't get it mistakenly,
I'm not helping you guys,


227
00:24:35.484 --> 00:24:37.577
and I'm not your savior.

228
00:24:37.752 --> 00:24:39.481
You can! You look so cheeky.

229
00:24:39.654 --> 00:24:41.713
They'll only bully you, not me.

230
00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:43.221
Thank you very much!

231
00:25:03.678 --> 00:25:05.646
Sir, I remember the code.

232
00:25:05.814 --> 00:25:07.748
It's Dong Tong, 
Tong Dong Dong, right?

233
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:09.817
- It's you?
- Yes.


234
00:25:09.985 --> 00:25:10.576
You should have said earlier.

235
00:25:10.752 --> 00:25:12.413
I forgot the code earlier.

236
00:25:12.654 --> 00:25:13.177
Sir,

237
00:25:13.355 --> 00:25:15.448
I'm CID5798,
I'm sent here to cooperate with you.


238
00:25:17.526 --> 00:25:19.221
Go home and have your hands stopped trembling.

239
00:25:19.394 --> 00:25:21.555
My hands are not trembling.
It's Parkinson.


240
00:25:22.097 --> 00:25:25.225
I'm only pretending.
That saves me from doing a lot of work.


241
00:25:25.467 --> 00:25:27.765
The boss has asked you
to stay at my home.

242
00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:30.697
What kind of stick are you chewing?

243
00:25:31.239 --> 00:25:32.069
To give up smoking.

244
00:25:44.085 --> 00:25:47.384
Hey... Miss Ho? 
Forget about her!

245
00:25:47.556 --> 00:25:51.185
Her boyfriend is the head of Anti-triad Unit.

246
00:25:51.893 --> 00:25:52.825
What are you saying?

247
00:25:52.994 --> 00:25:53.585
What?

248
00:25:53.762 --> 00:25:56.822
I'm keeping an eye
on that kid who's smoking.

249
00:25:59.334 --> 00:26:00.733
You mean Johnny?

250
00:26:00.902 --> 00:26:01.561
What is he?

251
00:26:01.736 --> 00:26:03.533
The head of the
4 Tigers of Beacon Hill.

252
00:26:03.738 --> 00:26:06.104
His big brother, Teddy Big,
is really somebody.


253
00:26:06.274 --> 00:26:09.038
He's the most suspicious in the case
which our boss lost his pistol.


254
00:26:10.345 --> 00:26:11.676
Keep an eye on him.

255
00:26:14.282 --> 00:26:15.249
Go!

256
00:26:20.188 --> 00:26:21.120
Big brother.

257
00:26:21.489 --> 00:26:23.582
You asshole, what a lousy idea.

258
00:26:24.059 --> 00:26:24.548
Big brother.

259
00:26:24.726 --> 00:26:26.591
Now somebody's after us for money.

260
00:26:27.162 --> 00:26:29.528
It's fine to traffic drugs,
why trafficking arms?


261
00:26:29.864 --> 00:26:32.492
You said, arms-trafficking is profiteering
during the Gulf War.


262
00:26:32.667 --> 00:26:34.032
You should've persuaded me.

263
00:26:34.302 --> 00:26:36.065
What are we going
to do with these AK47s?

264
00:26:36.504 --> 00:26:38.096
If we got pistols, we can rob.

265
00:26:38.773 --> 00:26:39.797
Johnny is here.

266
00:26:39.975 --> 00:26:40.964
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

267
00:26:41.142 --> 00:26:42.370
He's cheeky.

268
00:26:42.544 --> 00:26:45.775
Even you can be
cheeky if you've got money.

269
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.479
You're here, come in.

270
00:26:55.457 --> 00:26:57.254
They're for Feng-shui.
Keep your hands off.


271
00:26:57.425 --> 00:26:58.824
I'm sorry.

272
00:27:04.599 --> 00:27:05.588
How are you getting on?

273
00:27:09.137 --> 00:27:11.662
You're cheeky now.

274
00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:15.002
Don't worry, my dad has gone traveling.

275
00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:17.744
He won't have come back
even our cars reach Shenzhen.


276
00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.847
Let's see

277
00:27:20.982 --> 00:27:25.009
and do pay us the money for the 2 cars
of my brother back.


278
00:27:25.453 --> 00:27:27.478
I can only pay you
when my clients pay me.

279
00:27:27.789 --> 00:27:29.381
You're not that in need of money, right?

280
00:27:29.557 --> 00:27:31.388
I need money badly.

281
00:27:31.626 --> 00:27:35.255
The money I collected in the school...
can't even afford 2 nights in the Karaoke.


282
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:39.423
I've got a great thing, wanna see?

283
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:43.931
It's great.
We stole from the police academy.


284
00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:48.035
Cop's pistol?

285
00:27:57.352 --> 00:28:01.220
3 for each. Don't fight for it.

286
00:28:10.098 --> 00:28:11.429
In memory of your fathers?

287
00:28:11.866 --> 00:28:15.302
Do I still need to work
if I've got so many fathers?


288
00:28:16.037 --> 00:28:18.528
They're all my ex-partners.

289
00:28:22.811 --> 00:28:24.142
Good, noodles...

290
00:28:26.214 --> 00:28:27.476
Cook some for yourself.

291
00:28:27.749 --> 00:28:29.808
Come on, no...

292
00:28:30.785 --> 00:28:31.649
Yes.

293
00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.947
Cook oneself is illegal?

294
00:28:36.725 --> 00:28:37.987
How many partners you've got?

295
00:28:40.795 --> 00:28:42.057
But there're 10 here.

296
00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.464
I have to prepare one to two more...

297
00:28:48.136 --> 00:28:50.070
One to two more...

298
00:28:50.238 --> 00:28:52.706
and see who's coming to me.

299
00:28:52.874 --> 00:28:58.244
Maybe he needs it. 
Just keep as stock.

300
00:29:00.648 --> 00:29:01.740
Would you mind?

301
00:29:03.184 --> 00:29:05.345
What are you saying?

302
00:29:05.754 --> 00:29:06.948
You don't understand?

303
00:29:09.624 --> 00:29:12.058
It's better if you don't understand.

304
00:29:13.027 --> 00:29:14.858
Die at an early age.

305
00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:16.757
Eat your noodles,
I'll have supper outside.


306
00:29:17.932 --> 00:29:20.127
Remember to do your homework,
you've to go to school on tomorrow.


307
00:29:20.301 --> 00:29:21.893
- Damn you.
- No damning.


308
00:29:33.414 --> 00:29:35.644
Nothing. Keep talking.

309
00:29:35.817 --> 00:29:37.216
You're always so dirty.

310
00:29:37.385 --> 00:29:38.409
I get used to it.

311
00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.711
I worked as a servant in a school,

312
00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:43.814
it was fine at first.

313
00:29:44.159 --> 00:29:47.458
But I have to work under Sir Chow.
Really trouble!


314
00:29:47.629 --> 00:29:49.096
What an ass.

315
00:29:50.331 --> 00:29:52.959
What are you doing?

316
00:29:53.868 --> 00:29:56.029
I'm less fortunate than you.

317
00:29:56.504 --> 00:29:58.096
I'm following the case of Teddy Big.

318
00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.034
Arms?

319
00:30:00.241 --> 00:30:03.608
What a coincidence!
We are also after Teddy Big.


320
00:30:04.078 --> 00:30:05.636
But for the pistol.

321
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.142
- Cop's pistol?
- Yes.


322
00:30:07.315 --> 00:30:12.252
Really?
They're in the machine gun business.


323
00:30:13.454 --> 00:30:14.421
Machine guns in HK?

324
00:30:14.589 --> 00:30:18.150
Yes, goods have arrived.

325
00:30:22.163 --> 00:30:23.687
Wow...

326
00:30:24.065 --> 00:30:26.158
Why don't you arrest them?

327
00:30:27.035 --> 00:30:28.730
The buyers are terrorists,

328
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:31.063
Boss wants to arrest all at one go.

329
00:30:31.539 --> 00:30:33.200
That's tough!

330
00:30:36.311 --> 00:30:38.506
It's life and death if something goes wrong.

331
00:30:39.914 --> 00:30:41.882
We can't afford to alarm them.

332
00:30:42.617 --> 00:30:47.680
Well, keep an eye for
the pistol for me as well.

333
00:30:49.057 --> 00:30:50.649
- Sure!
- Sure?


334
00:30:50.825 --> 00:30:52.258
You have my word.

335
00:30:52.894 --> 00:30:55.260
Among the gang of underground informers,

336
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:59.059
all are dead except you and me.

337
00:30:59.534 --> 00:31:03.470
Of course, I'll keep an eye for you.

338
00:31:07.375 --> 00:31:09.707
Everyone can die, except this.

339
00:31:11.246 --> 00:31:12.406
Lousy.

340
00:31:16.885 --> 00:31:18.853
Brother Teddy, stay calm.

341
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.612
We'll settle if there's any problem.

342
00:31:20.989 --> 00:31:25.323
Remember Chicken Brand
whom you arrested 10 years ago.


343
00:31:27.495 --> 00:31:29.258
He wants to say
hello to you Inspector Wong.

344
00:31:54.255 --> 00:31:55.552
Policeman.

345
00:31:58.459 --> 00:31:59.687
Understand?

346
00:32:00.528 --> 00:32:03.691
Yes, good.

347
00:32:05.199 --> 00:32:06.496
Understand?

348
00:32:07.969 --> 00:32:09.561
Damn you.

349
00:32:17.779 --> 00:32:19.440
No homework

350
00:32:20.315 --> 00:32:22.783
I'm deserved to be punished.

351
00:32:40.568 --> 00:32:43.469
No homework again

352
00:32:55.216 --> 00:32:58.310
Look around at the class

353
00:33:01.689 --> 00:33:05.090
Stare nothing at the class

354
00:33:06.728 --> 00:33:10.255
It's all my fault.

355
00:33:10.498 --> 00:33:13.228
Stand on one foot.

356
00:33:19.407 --> 00:33:20.704
A show over there.

357
00:33:21.876 --> 00:33:22.934
Watch only...

358
00:33:24.045 --> 00:33:25.034
What?

359
00:33:26.514 --> 00:33:32.043
I said watch only, don't laugh.

360
00:33:38.526 --> 00:33:40.357
Ha...

361
00:33:45.533 --> 00:33:46.090
Are you alright?

362
00:33:46.267 --> 00:33:47.165
Does it hurt?

363
00:33:47.468 --> 00:33:49.299
You just didn't take
my words to the heart.

364
00:33:53.041 --> 00:33:56.306
Star of the week

365
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.988
This student is brainless, he's hopeless.

366
00:34:10.691 --> 00:34:14.320
Yes... always absent-minded, hopeless.

367
00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.959
He's a jerk already looks as...

368
00:34:21.135 --> 00:34:22.534
if he's sick.

369
00:34:22.804 --> 00:34:24.567
Never seen a "star" like him.

370
00:34:41.722 --> 00:34:45.385
You two should be looking for the pistol
not looking up the dictionary.


371
00:34:46.527 --> 00:34:47.653
Boss,

372
00:34:47.895 --> 00:34:51.126
he couldn't hand in his homework today

373
00:34:51.399 --> 00:34:53.390
and was punished by not allowing to go back
the classroom.


374
00:34:53.634 --> 00:34:57.035
You can look into the case
even if you're outside the classroom!


375
00:34:58.039 --> 00:35:00.667
If I fail to hand in homework again,
I'm out of the school.


376
00:35:00.842 --> 00:35:02.332
Then I can't look into anything.

377
00:35:03.644 --> 00:35:05.839
Can you solve this calculation?
Let's see.


378
00:35:06.581 --> 00:35:08.344
I know nothing about trigonometry.

379
00:35:10.084 --> 00:35:11.779
When you first asked
me to handle this case,

380
00:35:11.953 --> 00:35:13.045
your attitude was different.

381
00:35:13.221 --> 00:35:13.949
No, he's always like this.

382
00:35:14.122 --> 00:35:15.714
I'm always like this.

383
00:35:16.257 --> 00:35:18.350
My soft words are for cheating you
to get involved.


384
00:35:18.726 --> 00:35:21.695
What about asking some other policemen
to come here...


385
00:35:21.863 --> 00:35:23.296
and solve the Math.

386
00:35:23.464 --> 00:35:25.989
You're an idiot!
That means disclosing the case to everybody?


387
00:35:26.567 --> 00:35:29.297
Let me tell you finish this case quickly,

388
00:35:29.537 --> 00:35:32.005
or I'll kick your brains out
with my Scissors Legs.


389
00:35:33.174 --> 00:35:33.936
What?

390
00:35:34.108 --> 00:35:36.508
I'll fly over and kick you with legs
like scissors and kick your brain out.


391
00:35:36.677 --> 00:35:38.804
Scissors Legs, scared?

392
00:35:39.413 --> 00:35:40.505
Very...

393
00:35:46.487 --> 00:35:49.012
Scissors Legs, what a joke.

394
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.852
He was really powerful.

395
00:35:52.026 --> 00:35:52.924
He was!

396
00:35:53.094 --> 00:35:54.356
He was able to
deal with 20 guys alone.

397
00:35:54.529 --> 00:35:56.360
Or only be able to shoot 20 planes!?

398
00:35:57.732 --> 00:36:01.395
Dad, are you alright? Dad.

399
00:36:01.636 --> 00:36:02.762
Dad, go to hell, Dad.

400
00:36:03.004 --> 00:36:03.902
How can you say that!

401
00:36:14.549 --> 00:36:15.948
Damn it! I'm late.

402
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:45.708
It's only 6 o'clock.

403
00:36:53.788 --> 00:36:58.248
I'm influenced by his hard-work,
I've to do a little revision too.


404
00:37:07.235 --> 00:37:09.328
Yam...

405
00:37:09.503 --> 00:37:10.765
I'm not called Yam.

406
00:37:10.938 --> 00:37:12.200
But you really look like.

407
00:37:12.373 --> 00:37:13.965
Have you finished your Biology?
Let me copy.


408
00:37:14.175 --> 00:37:16.143
I won't even if
I have. Are you nuts?

409
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.813
I'll give you $50 in return.

410
00:37:21.115 --> 00:37:22.309
I do...

411
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:25.384
You want money before finishing the homework?

412
00:37:26.354 --> 00:37:29.551
Stay away, one by one.

413
00:37:31.926 --> 00:37:33.257
As many as you want.

414
00:37:33.561 --> 00:37:35.256
Any compositions? Compositions.

415
00:37:35.563 --> 00:37:38.589
Keung, yours is torn, go away.

416
00:37:39.934 --> 00:37:43.199
- He's quite popular.
- Yes.


417
00:37:52.647 --> 00:37:53.841
Copy this so late?

418
00:37:56.984 --> 00:37:59.544
You're ruining your future. Hopeless.

419
00:38:01.889 --> 00:38:04.221
Look, I've finished.

420
00:38:05.026 --> 00:38:05.890
You think you are smart?

421
00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.152
Of course.

422
00:38:10.097 --> 00:38:11.758
I'm not mocking you.

423
00:38:12.767 --> 00:38:15.964
I just want to say, from now on.

424
00:38:16.337 --> 00:38:19.067
I won't let anyone throwing dusters at me.

425
00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.640
I won't be punished by standing
onto the corridor


426
00:38:21.809 --> 00:38:23.367
or standing on the playground,

427
00:38:23.544 --> 00:38:26.604
or holding a damn cardboard publicly,
like a monkey. No!


428
00:38:30.818 --> 00:38:32.376
Just keep copying...

429
00:38:39.393 --> 00:38:41.884
Sudden test, those who fail will be standing
on the playground for a week.


430
00:38:51.138 --> 00:38:54.471
Chinese History Test

431
00:39:34.515 --> 00:39:36.244
- Mobile phone?
- Cool, isn't it?


432
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:44.218
What?

433
00:39:46.861 --> 00:39:51.093
What? Chinese history test?
You two can handle it.


434
00:39:51.465 --> 00:39:55.663
What? Boss, my Chinese History won't do.

435
00:39:55.836 --> 00:39:57.804
Hold on! Mandy,

436
00:39:58.139 --> 00:40:00.334
ask all seniors to come up here.

437
00:40:00.574 --> 00:40:03.543
Ask them who was the one

438
00:40:03.744 --> 00:40:05.541
who suppressed the "An
-Shi Rebellion"?

439
00:40:05.713 --> 00:40:07.544
A: Kwok Chi
-Yee,

440
00:40:07.882 --> 00:40:11.147
B for boy, is that clear?

441
00:40:11.385 --> 00:40:15.583
Li Kwang
-Bud, C: Li Hark
-Yong...

442
00:40:16.056 --> 00:40:18.217
It's Li Hark
-Yong, not Lee Hack
-Ken.

443
00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.827
A is Kwok Chi-Yee,
B is Lee Kwang-Bud.


444
00:40:30.738 --> 00:40:32.603
Which two of them are the heroes?

445
00:40:33.174 --> 00:40:34.471
Kwok Chi
-Yee and Chu Wen.

446
00:40:34.775 --> 00:40:36.902
It seems to be Lee Kwang
-Bud and Chu Wen.

447
00:40:37.077 --> 00:40:38.874
So who's the hero? Answer me!

448
00:40:39.079 --> 00:40:42.048
Kwok Chi
-Yee or Chu Wen?

449
00:40:42.416 --> 00:40:44.008
What? You look up the book?

450
00:40:44.652 --> 00:40:47.348
No, I can manage... few more seconds.

451
00:40:47.521 --> 00:40:50.854
Son, it's Chu Wen. 
Who's Chu Wen?

452
00:40:51.225 --> 00:40:54.217
The answer is B.

453
00:40:56.764 --> 00:41:00.359
Banana? B for banana.

454
00:41:04.638 --> 00:41:05.969
Ask them.

455
00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:11.041
What's the "Ox
-Li Party Conflict"?

456
00:41:11.412 --> 00:41:15.007
Search book again?
You even don't know this!


457
00:41:15.182 --> 00:41:17.480
What have you studied? Shit!

458
00:41:18.819 --> 00:41:19.547
Which big case are you in?

459
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.778
No idea.

460
00:41:23.791 --> 00:41:29.525
A for apple, that's it.

461
00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.125
Next question, listen carefully...

462
00:41:37.438 --> 00:41:39.906
The answer is D, D for dog.

463
00:41:40.074 --> 00:41:42.804
D for, D for dog.

464
00:41:54.321 --> 00:41:55.288
B.

465
00:41:56.524 --> 00:41:58.458
Uncle Tat, what are you doing here?

466
00:41:59.693 --> 00:42:01.888
Well... collecting rubbish.

467
00:42:02.062 --> 00:42:04.394
The female toilet is blocked,
can you do with that?


468
00:42:04.698 --> 00:42:06.393
Come with me.

469
00:42:14.408 --> 00:42:18.208
What, the test is over.

470
00:42:18.946 --> 00:42:20.413
Sir, which case?

471
00:42:20.614 --> 00:42:21.308
Three wolfs.

472
00:42:21.482 --> 00:42:23.245
Dead already?

473
00:42:23.417 --> 00:42:24.406
Reverse a previous judgment?!

474
00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:44.961
Stupid me, I should have guessed that.

475
00:42:54.181 --> 00:42:55.273
No.

476
00:43:07.494 --> 00:43:08.392
No again.

477
00:43:24.845 --> 00:43:26.005
You two are riding?

478
00:43:28.916 --> 00:43:30.144
Falling instead.

479
00:43:30.784 --> 00:43:32.149
So you two are cheating.

480
00:43:33.921 --> 00:43:38.984
No, only me who's cheating.
Arrest me.


481
00:43:39.693 --> 00:43:40.682
Come out with me.

482
00:43:41.962 --> 00:43:42.929
A moment please.

483
00:43:54.441 --> 00:43:57.604
He cheated in the Chinese history test by using
the Chinese literature book.


484
00:43:58.278 --> 00:44:00.246
You are dumb.

485
00:44:01.715 --> 00:44:03.706
That's not exactly cheating.

486
00:44:03.884 --> 00:44:05.681
He was guilty.

487
00:44:06.053 --> 00:44:07.987
I only want to let him have
the proper punishment.


488
00:44:08.789 --> 00:44:09.847
What do you say?

489
00:44:10.024 --> 00:44:12.857
Deduct 3 marks from his conduct as usual.
Stop it.


490
00:44:14.194 --> 00:44:17.721
Please don't. A deduction of 12 marks
will let him out of this school.


491
00:44:19.733 --> 00:44:21.098
Miss Leung, what about you?

492
00:44:21.268 --> 00:44:22.360
Kill him.

493
00:44:22.536 --> 00:44:23.525
What did you say?

494
00:44:23.704 --> 00:44:26.901
That isn't what you want? 
Just cheating.

495
00:44:27.174 --> 00:44:28.903
It's one of our experience of growing up.

496
00:44:29.176 --> 00:44:32.475
Who hasn't cheated before?

497
00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:37.683
But you even didn't
use your brains to cheat.

498
00:44:38.886 --> 00:44:40.547
Stand properly. Don't move!

499
00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:46.421
You don't use your brains, you deserve it.

500
00:44:47.194 --> 00:44:50.322
I suggest arranging for another test.

501
00:44:50.898 --> 00:44:55.767
If he still doesn't learn from it,
test him again and again.


502
00:44:56.103 --> 00:44:57.263
Until he passes.

503
00:44:57.905 --> 00:45:00.601
That's punishing me, 
I can't afford the time.

504
00:45:00.774 --> 00:45:02.207
- Save your time from going to The race-course.
- Yes...


505
00:45:02.376 --> 00:45:03.502
I agree.

506
00:45:04.244 --> 00:45:07.702
You can talk to his parents
and try to understand his family background.


507
00:45:09.016 --> 00:45:12.383
Fine, I've decided.

508
00:45:12.753 --> 00:45:15.688
He's punished by staying after school for a week
and cleaning the playground for 2 weeks.


509
00:45:15.856 --> 00:45:18.086
Deduct 5 marks from his conduct,
re-test on next week.


510
00:45:18.258 --> 00:45:20.556
Also, I want to meet your parents.

511
00:45:21.028 --> 00:45:24.259
Parents? I don't have any.

512
00:45:24.431 --> 00:45:26.296
I've got no relatives, no friends.

513
00:45:26.734 --> 00:45:27.962
Who's your guardian?

514
00:45:28.135 --> 00:45:29.397
I'm my own guardian.

515
00:45:30.637 --> 00:45:31.729
If there's anybody you
want to see, it's me.

516
00:45:31.905 --> 00:45:33.338
His file.

517
00:45:36.643 --> 00:45:38.042
Who's his guardian?

518
00:45:39.546 --> 00:45:40.604
Uncle Tat?

519
00:45:40.981 --> 00:45:42.073
Uncle Tat!

520
00:45:42.249 --> 00:45:45.480
Stop it, God... big news.

521
00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:56.220
Uncle Tat, is Star Chow really your son?

522
00:45:56.797 --> 00:45:58.424
You're a senior to me, you say.

523
00:45:58.866 --> 00:45:59.890
Star Chow, say!

524
00:46:11.612 --> 00:46:13.170
Don't laugh, say!

525
00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:17.977
Yes.

526
00:46:18.719 --> 00:46:20.186
Yes... I'm sorry...

527
00:46:20.354 --> 00:46:25.087
I bet, they look exactly the same.

528
00:46:25.425 --> 00:46:27.791
What? The same?

529
00:46:28.328 --> 00:46:29.920
His dad? Nonsense.

530
00:46:30.097 --> 00:46:32.657
Hey, no... here...

531
00:46:33.333 --> 00:46:35.494
Your surname's Tso, his is Chow, why?

532
00:46:35.669 --> 00:46:38.229
How do I know? Why?

533
00:46:42.743 --> 00:46:44.005
This is an order.

534
00:46:47.347 --> 00:46:52.751
When he was born,
I named him, Star Tso.

535
00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:57.357
But then he named himself, Star Chow.
I don't know why.


536
00:46:57.524 --> 00:46:59.082
Is this correct?

537
00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:00.618
It's right.

538
00:47:01.228 --> 00:47:02.991
Sir, excuse us.

539
00:47:03.697 --> 00:47:08.327
Hold on, Uncle Tat,
we want you to come up here to tell


540
00:47:08.802 --> 00:47:09.928
your son cheated in a test.

541
00:47:11.605 --> 00:47:18.135
Cheated? That's disgraceful, no good...

542
00:47:18.679 --> 00:47:20.909
You can't cheat, 
Sir, cheating...

543
00:47:21.081 --> 00:47:22.207
Excuse us.

544
00:47:22.783 --> 00:47:25.616
Hey, don't you see,

545
00:47:26.119 --> 00:47:30.317
parents and teachers should cooperate
to teach him.


546
00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:31.548
Right?

547
00:47:31.725 --> 00:47:34.023
How long can we teach him?

548
00:47:34.194 --> 00:47:37.960
Your son's been here for only 3 days
and he cheated.


549
00:47:38.332 --> 00:47:39.890
- Give me one or two slaps and then go.
- No...


550
00:47:40.067 --> 00:47:41.796
You should teach him effectively.

551
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.933
Don't be too serious.

552
00:47:43.103 --> 00:47:43.865
Of course, not to be too serious.

553
00:47:44.037 --> 00:47:47.302
Alright, I know what to do.

554
00:47:47.741 --> 00:47:52.041
You cheated?
I'll beat the hell out of you.


555
00:47:52.212 --> 00:47:53.543
Don't be too agitated...

556
00:47:55.282 --> 00:47:56.544
I'll beat you...

557
00:47:56.717 --> 00:47:58.241
- Dead already?
- Dead already.


558
00:47:58.418 --> 00:47:59.783
- You're lying.
- No.


559
00:47:59.953 --> 00:48:01.011
One more hit.

560
00:48:12.699 --> 00:48:13.688
You son-of...

561
00:48:13.867 --> 00:48:18.065
Sir Chow, please.

562
00:48:18.605 --> 00:48:23.668
I have to use all my strength
to beat a strong man like you.


563
00:48:24.711 --> 00:48:25.643
Well...

564
00:48:25.812 --> 00:48:28.303
I'm old and lacking of strength.

565
00:48:28.615 --> 00:48:32.415
After I beat you, my bones crack.

566
00:48:32.586 --> 00:48:33.678
- Really?
- Yes.


567
00:48:33.854 --> 00:48:34.878
I'm sorry.

568
00:48:35.055 --> 00:48:37.580
Never mind, I'm in this business.

569
00:48:37.758 --> 00:48:38.884
Go and see the doctor, 
I'll pay for it.

570
00:48:39.059 --> 00:48:39.525
Thank you, thank you.

571
00:48:39.693 --> 00:48:40.717
Uncle Tat!

572
00:48:42.963 --> 00:48:43.452
Miss Ho.

573
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:44.654
Don't be so angry.

574
00:48:45.332 --> 00:48:48.392
Star Chow, do you know
how great your father is?

575
00:48:51.838 --> 00:48:58.141
Don't mention it, all parents are great.

576
00:48:58.312 --> 00:49:01.975
He can't go on like this,
let me be his tutor.


577
00:49:02.716 --> 00:49:04.707
I've got no money to pay you.

578
00:49:04.952 --> 00:49:06.249
We can't owe you this favor, Miss.

579
00:49:06.553 --> 00:49:07.850
- Uncle Tat!
- Dad.


580
00:49:08.221 --> 00:49:09.347
I won't take any money.

581
00:49:09.723 --> 00:49:10.451
No...

582
00:49:10.624 --> 00:49:11.989
I'll lead him onto the right track.

583
00:49:12.159 --> 00:49:12.818
No...

584
00:49:12.993 --> 00:49:14.824
No... not good.

585
00:49:15.462 --> 00:49:19.023
So, let's start from tomorrow.
Don't worry.


586
00:49:19.933 --> 00:49:22.299
Thank you, thank you.

587
00:49:22.769 --> 00:49:23.861
Thanks a lot.

588
00:49:26.073 --> 00:49:28.439
Save it, it's a golden opportunity for you.

589
00:49:29.776 --> 00:49:32.404
You said no to her, how dare you!

590
00:49:32.746 --> 00:49:35.237
Be smart, don't reveal your identity.

591
00:49:35.449 --> 00:49:36.381
Hey.

592
00:49:36.883 --> 00:49:37.747
Somebody's looking for you.

593
00:49:37.918 --> 00:49:38.509
Who?

594
00:49:38.685 --> 00:49:39.709
Go up and you'll know.

595
00:49:39.886 --> 00:49:40.944
OK. Coming.

596
00:49:41.555 --> 00:49:42.283
I must show him how smart I'm.

597
00:49:42.456 --> 00:49:43.423
He's coming.

598
00:49:55.135 --> 00:49:57.035
Who helps him just stand on his side.

599
00:50:14.454 --> 00:50:16.718
You want protection fee, 
I pay it for him.

600
00:50:16.923 --> 00:50:18.982
You, Turtle, must have no idea of death!

601
00:50:19.559 --> 00:50:21.959
Let me take your mouth as an ashtray.

602
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.928
Take him here.

603
00:50:45.419 --> 00:50:46.681
Anything else?

604
00:50:48.221 --> 00:50:48.983
Nothing.

605
00:50:49.156 --> 00:50:51.681
So, don't call me up here unless necessary.

606
00:50:52.125 --> 00:50:53.183
OK!

607
00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:01.860
Hopeless!

608
00:51:02.035 --> 00:51:03.559
Star, you're powerful than Bruce Lee.

609
00:51:03.737 --> 00:51:04.829
Star, do you want
to have your shoes cleaned?

610
00:51:05.005 --> 00:51:08.031
Smart Star, have you got enough money?
I can give you.


611
00:51:10.444 --> 00:51:13.709
What's more, if you're not neat and tidy,
I must beat you.


612
00:51:14.014 --> 00:51:18.110
Your hand. Show me your hand.

613
00:51:19.252 --> 00:51:20.378
I'm too old to
be hit on the palm.

614
00:51:20.554 --> 00:51:21.248
Show me.

615
00:51:21.421 --> 00:51:22.353
Don't, no need, Miss.

616
00:51:22.522 --> 00:51:23.489
That one.

617
00:51:25.158 --> 00:51:26.216
I'll show you somewhere else to beat.

618
00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:29.055
If you are cruel enough,
just use all your strength to beat me.


619
00:51:31.998 --> 00:51:33.488
Like a garbage can.

620
00:51:34.901 --> 00:51:37.734
It's shameful if Miss Ho sees this.

621
00:51:39.439 --> 00:51:43.876
Hey, what's this? A toaster?
Throw the bread away.


622
00:51:44.878 --> 00:51:47.176
The blue magazines in
your room you have to...

623
00:51:49.483 --> 00:51:50.745
Tidy up your room, stop eating.

624
00:51:50.917 --> 00:51:53.249
- What?
- Let's play something.


625
00:51:53.487 --> 00:51:54.078
OK, tidy this place.

626
00:51:54.254 --> 00:51:55.186
Pretend to have Parkinson!

627
00:51:55.355 --> 00:51:57.380
Is Parkinson your dad?
Always, so fond of this.


628
00:51:57.924 --> 00:52:00.051
I don't care how
old you're, I tell you.

629
00:52:04.998 --> 00:52:07.057
The son shouldn't have a larger room
than his dad.


630
00:52:08.869 --> 00:52:10.302
Miss, I'm not sure about this.

631
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:11.630
About what?
