00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.380
Oh! How'd that happen?
<i>- Mon Dieu,</i> Elliot!


2
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.620
What did you do?
Look at the mess you've made!


3
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.100
I didn't knock it over!
- It happened just like magic?


4
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.100
Don't be a pain.
- I'm going to tell.


5
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.220
I didn't spill it.

6
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.580
Naughty boy.
- Leave me alone! I'm accident-prone.


7
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.980
Behave yourself.
- Let go! Stop it!


8
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.540
I'm telling your mama and papa.
You are very naughty.


9
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.580
Stop it.

10
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.140
How many times have I told you
not to come in the kitchen?


11
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.900
How many times have I told you?
One million times!


12
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.140
Testing. Lets begin.

13
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.580
Hello, Elliot. I've known you for a long
time, always considered you a friend...


14
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.020
...and I admire your work.

15
00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.500
Thank you, Martin.

16
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.780
I always have trouble saying your name,
because Australians have difficulty...


17
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.140
...with the American R.
It would be easier if your name was Bob.


18
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.780
This is a serious interview.
- I'm sorry.


19
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.180
I'm just a little anxious.

20
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.820
You've achieved a great deal of success
in your creative and artistic field.


21
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.500
You've traveled a great deal.

22
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.380
You have influential friends. You've dated
a bevy of bright and beautiful women.


23
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.660
Yet you've never had a lasting relationship.

24
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.580
I never seem to get it right.

25
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.820
I'm a simple girl. I don't need
to do all these far-out things...


26
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.700
...with somebody who's never around.

27
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.500
Does this mean were not
gonna have breakfast? Thank you.


28
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.660
Get out!

29
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.340
<i>You came close to getting married once,
quite close.</i>


30
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.740
Yeah, Kathleen.

31
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.260
<i>It started out all right. Sunny day, lovely
flowers, nice crowd. Everyone was there.</i>


32
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.380
<i>Except the bride.</i>

33
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.020
That was a difficult day.

34
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.140
That's when you called me
about the island?


35
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.060
Yeah, I was hoping you could help me.
- If you're selected, when can you leave?


36
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.340
I have an assignment in South America
for a month, and then I'm free.


37
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.820
Why do you think your relationships
do not work out?


38
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.820
I'm not always honest with myself
about what I want.


39
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.740
<i>We'll be landing at Los Angeles
International Airport momentarily...</i>


40
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.220
<i>...where the local time is 4:05 a.m.</i>

41
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.420
<i>We've enjoyed serving you on Flight 241,
and if your future travel plans...</i>


42
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.740
<i>...take you to South America, we hope
you will once again choose Aero Brazil.</i>


43
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.620
US citizens, over here. 
Aliens, over there.

44
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.300
This way, please.

45
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.660
Hey, Tony.
- Hi, Susan. See you.


46
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.620
Next, please.

47
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.940
Excuse me, sir,
could you hold my baby, please?


48
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.460
Sir, could you help me and hold my baby?
Thank you very much.


49
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.380
Thank you. Next?

50
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.780
Hello, Aidan, this is Dr. Rubino.
Whats the emergency?


51
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.140
Hi, mom. Yeah, I'm safe. 
We just landed.

52
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.180
I'm exhausted.
Mom, its 4:00 in the morning.


53
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.300
I really gotta go. Bye.

54
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.500
Don't you hate getting in this late?
My eyes get so dry when I fly.


55
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.860
Hold it. You're the guy with the turban!

56
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.860
Okay, Martin, thank you.

57
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.900
<i>Passenger Joel Stearns, please pick up
the nearest white courtesy phone.</i>


58
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.660
<i>Passengers arriving
on Aero Brazil Flight 241...</i>


59
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.620
<i>...may claim their baggage at Carousel 2.</i>

60
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.700
Are you crazy?
Taking a picture of me blowing my nose?


61
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.860
Would you stop it?

62
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.220
Okay. I'm a professional.
Call me, well do a sitting sometime.


63
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.340
Yeah.

64
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.860
Your bags moving.

65
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.180
Want me to get that? 
III get it for you.

66
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.740
No, leave it alone. Leave it.

67
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.380
Excuse me, sir.

68
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.900
Going to unload your own luggage?

69
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.940
This lady accidentally lost her bag.

70
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.060
I wasn't watching where I put my bag.

71
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.300
Its all right. It will come around.
Here it is.


72
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.780
Sorry to cause you so much trouble.

73
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.740
We cant be responsible for your head
if you stick it in the baggage hole.


74
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.940
Ill remember that.

75
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.980
Look, I don't know
if something was going down or not.


76
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.540
Please open all of your bags.

77
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.700
They may just be smuggling
a bottle of vodka for all I know.


78
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.380
I got photos of both of them.

79
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.940
I need some stuff on this roll,
but if you wanna see them, here's my card.


80
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.380
We have to do
a full check on everybody.

81
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.780
Ill remember that.
- Nice job.


82
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.780
You stay out of trouble.

83
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.140
Smuggling.

84
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.740
Hello, my little friends.

85
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.420
<i>The white zone is for the immediate

<i>No parking.</i>

87
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.580
Did you have any trouble in there?

88
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.300
Absolutely not. 
I'm a professional.

89
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.220
Yes, a professional.

90
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.540
<i>Good morning,
and welcome to LA's premier XXX club...</i>

<i>Give it up.</i>

95
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.460
Look what I got!

96
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.660
Now.

97
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.700
We think you'll find this will help
Mr. Walker breathe a lot better.


98
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.580
Wait here.
- All right.


99
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.380
Mr. Walker, everything checks out fine.
- Good.


100
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.540
LAPD!

101
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.660
Freeze!

102
00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.460
Is this a raid?
- I'm 21, I swear.


103
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.140
Get out of the way.
- All of you.


104
00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.580
Get down!
- Come here!


105
00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.380
On the floor!
- Watch it, buddy.


106
00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.020
Get with the program!
The floor! On the floor!


107
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.580
You! Get with the program!

108
00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.900
Out of my way! Kill them!

109
00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.060
Spread em. You've never been
in trouble with the police before?


110
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.380
I haven't. I'm clean.
- Yeah, you're clean. Miranda.


111
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.620
If you would do the honors,
Detective Kingston.


112

My pleasure.

113
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.260
Where are you going? Sit down!
You are sitting down!


114
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.180
You sit down, unless you're crawling.

115
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.500
Fred, my feet are
killing me in these shoes.

116
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.980
Welcome to King Solomons mine.

117

<i>Hi. I'm Sheila Kingston, and I'm a cop.</i>

122

<i>Thought I was a supermodel?</i>

123
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.980
<i>Don't feel bad.
Everyone makes that mistake.</i>


124
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.540
<i>Damn it, they got away. 
I hate that.</i>

125
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.820
<i>That's my partner, Detective Fred Lavery.
June 13, that's the date.</i>


126
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.420
<i>It was the beginning
of the wildest case of my career.</i>


127
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.020
<i>Let me tell you,
my love life has never been the same.</i>


128
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.340
<i>And your love life may never be
the same either.</i>


129
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.700
<i>Here we go. 
Case No. 11725.</i>

130
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.620
<i>The FBI and the US Customs Bureau
had been trying to break...</i>


131
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.300
<i>...a South American diamond-smuggling
ring for about two years without success.</i>


132
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.740
<i>That's where we came in.</i>

133
00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.980
<i>And our backup finally arrived. Late.
Must have been a line at Dunkin' Donuts.</i>


134
00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.420
<i>We got the diamonds.
The bad guys got away.</i>


135
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.180
<i>All we knew, one of
them had a bad cold.</i>

136
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.900
<i>You missed Walker. How could you miss
a man in a wheelchair?</i>


137
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.300
Things didn't go that well
at the airport either.


138
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.340
Really?
- A man took your picture.


139
00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.460
Took my picture?

140
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.740
<i>...it's a detour, and people act out...</i>

141

Ill be two minutes, pal.

142
00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.060
<i>...early childhood humiliations
in order to get rid of them.</i>


143
00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:03.820
<i>It's been estimated that about a third of all
couples have tried spanking each other.</i>


144
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.500
<i>About a third have tried
tying each other up.</i>


145
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.140
<i>The woman in the pain profession,
the dominatrix...</i>


146
00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.420
<i>...considers it an ideal profession.</i>

147
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.940
<i>She can sleep in late.
She can wear interesting clothes.</i>


148
00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.940
<i>She can push men around.
And with her whips and handcuffs...</i>


149
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.460
<i>...she actually makes
more money per hour than I do.</i>


150
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.420
<i>And she can also charge it
on Visa or MasterCard. It's sometimes--</i>


151
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.300
Here we are.

152
00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.420
That's him.

153
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.460
Looks like hes taking another trip.
- Yeah, with his camera.


154
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.860
Shall I grab him?

155
00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.820
Not yet. It doesn't mean that
the damn film is in the camera.


156
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.980
All right. You go search the house.
I'm gonna follow the cab. Go!


157
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.460
Here you go.
- Thanks.


158
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:21.020
<i>An hour later, Elliot Slater boarded a ship
at Los Angeles Harbor, Pier 56.</i>


159
00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.220
<i>We assumed he was going
on another photo assignment. He wasn't.</i>


160
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.940
<i>He didn't know what was ahead of him
or who was behind him.</i>


161
00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.100
Whoa, Doctor. No more blood samples.

162
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.660
No, I came to tell you
that you passed your physical.


163
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.220
You are HIV-negative
and all your body parts...


164
00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.900
...that should be working, work.

165
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.660
That's great, but you didn't try them all.

166
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.300
I did forget one.
I always save that for last.


167
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.300
Drop your pants.

168
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.020
I don't even know your first name.
- Doctor.


169
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.660
Turn your head and cough. Again.

170
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.420
I cant believe I'm doing this.

171
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.740
I bet you've been doing this
since you were 13.


172
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.300
No, I mean being here on this ship.

173
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.140
Follow the rules, and you'll do fine.
From here on out, we only ask one thing.


174
00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.220
What?

175
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.420
Wed like you to refrain from
any private sexual stimulations.


176
00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.900
We want you to perform up to
your own expectations once you arrive.


177
00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.260
Just finishing a roll.

178
00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.980
Good luck.

179
00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.460
<i>Are you positive?
- I think so.</i>


180
00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.820
Think so is not positive.
- I'm pretty sure.


181
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.260
Pretty sure is not positive.
We need positive.


182
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:14.540
Does this help?
- Yes. That's her. She went for my throat.


183
00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.300
I'm positive.
- Thank you, Susan.


184
00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:17.820
You can now go back to work.

185
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.100
In the event of a water landing,
there are six exits on this plane.


186
00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.660
I could've been a stewardess.

187
00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.180
Lets put this on the wire,
Nina and all her aliases.


188
00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.540
I'm not gonna put an APB out on a person
with magic marker on her face.


189
00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:29.660
Its a red dot.

190
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.060
In my office.
- Yes, sir.


191
00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.100
I got an ID on Nina.
- I got the same from the airport security.


192
00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.420
He said she was a beauty queen.
- Shes a psychotic who kills people...


193
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.180
...and injures the handicapped.
- Handicapped criminals.


194
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:44.100
Folks, please, I'm late for a meeting,
if you don't mind. Come on.


195
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.220
So Walker talked.
Said that Nina was partners with Omar.


196
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.300
What do you got on Omar, Mr. Filofax?
- Okay, at your service.


197
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.340
Omar, precious gem smugglers
pinup boy.


198
00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.420
Wanted for murdering two
Hasidic diamond merchants in Rotterdam.


199
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.220
No known aliases or physical description.
No known photos.


200
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.140
Ill take Obscure Criminals for $500.
- Except there now is a photograph...


201
00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.380
...but we are not in possession of it.
- Where does that leave us?


202
00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.060
My deduction?
- Please.


203
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.780
We can assume that Nina told Omar
this photographer...


204
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.420
...took the only photos of Omar
in the modern world.


205
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:16.900
Omar is going to want to get his hands
on this photographer, Slater, pretty bad.


206
00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.260
Lieutenant, if we can get to Slater
and his camera before they do...


207
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.140
...we can set a trap,
and they will walk right into our arms.


208
00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.140
Works for me. Lieutenant?

209
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.180
God, I'm...
- Don't say it.


210
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.980
...good.
- He said it.


211
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.860
Okay, that's it. Fred's right.
That's your next assignment.


212
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.100
Did you trace Slater's ship?
- It wasn't easy.


213
00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:41.020
But we know its going
to an island resort, a club.


214
00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.900
Club Med?
- Well, its not your usual resort.


215
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.580
Its a place for SandM, B

216
00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.140
MandM?

217
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.020
They have a Club Med for sex orgies?

218
00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:01.580
Maybe this will help you out. Here's some
bondage magazines to study up on.


219
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.660
Tomorrow, you will be meeting with
Dr. Martin Halifax, the islands owner.


220
00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.540
He will set you up to go undercover.

221
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.220
That's what we do.
- Yes, we do.


222
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.100
This is now over. Get out of my office.
I'm late for supper.


223
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.660
Thanks, boss.
- Good night, Lieutenant.


224
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.860
Lets go, Fred.

225
00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.740
I ate four green ones. 
I don't feel anything.

226
00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:22.380
Wait one hour.

227
00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.660
This is just so gross.

228
00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.700
Come on. Welcome to the 90s.
Its just an alternative lifestyle.


229
00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.100
An alternative lifestyle.
Do you know what that is?


230
00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.820
A phrase deviants use
to cover up their sex lives.


231
00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.300
Maybe if you'd spiced up your sex life
a little, you wouldn't be divorced.


232
00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.580
What? I spiced it up plenty.
Many a time, I let the wife get on top.


233
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.660
On top? It just boggles the mind.

234
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.860
I was joking.
- I figured.


235
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.900
Ill get the file on Nina. Do whatever.

236
00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.100
Catch you later. 
I gotta get a bikini wax.

237
00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.540
Stop telling me about that
disgusting female stuff.


238
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.900
No wonder you were never married.
- I have PMS, too. Do you know that?


239
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.260
Sometimes I bloat, weight gain,
temporary water buildup.


240
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.300
I hate to tell you this. I clot.
Heavy flow days.


241
00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.860
Welcome. I'm Senior Trainer Richard.

242
00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.980
Hi, Richard.
- There's no talking, Riba.


243
00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.260
Dr. Williams will be around
to collect your release forms.


244
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:33.020
While shes doing that,
please take off your clothing.


245
00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.300
You will spend one week at Eden.

246
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.580
Each of you has specifically chosen
to pay your entrance fee...


247
00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.340
...and sign up as submissives at Eden,
some of you for fun...


248
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.940
...others of you to examine
your sexual and emotional lives.


249
00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:52.420
And we, after careful screening,
have chosen you for one of three reasons:


250
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.780
Your curiosity, your desire to obey...

251
00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.900
...or your capacity for arousal.

252
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.060
From now on, you will be
referred to as citizens of Eden.


253
00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.980
And you will obey all of our commands.
Is that clear?


254
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.620
Yes.
- Good.


255
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.780
When you arrive at Eden,
all of your luggage will be taken...


256
00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.900
...and stored on the island
for safekeeping until you leave.


257
00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.100
At Eden, everybody wears a specific outfit.

258
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:23.060
Yours designates that you're citizens
or, if you will, submissives.


259
00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.780
The trainers will hand out
your Eden attire...


260
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.260
...which you'll wear
during your stay on our island.


261
00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.100
Excuse me, Doctor.

262
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.740
Is this the right boat
to the fantasy camp for golfers?


263
00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.100
Golfers?
- Yes.


264
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.220
I'm supposed to play with Lee Trevino.

265
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.980
You come with me.
- Arnold Palmer and Chi Chi Rodriguez...


266
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:44.340
Also, alcohol and drugs are not permitted
on the island.


267
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.940
You'll love it here.
I've been here three times.


268
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.100
Riba, be quiet.

269
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.460
Please put on your Eden outfits,
and return to your room.


270
00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.740
I guess that covers all the details
the department has to know, Dr. Halifax.


271
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.540
<i>On June 15, Detective Lavery met with
the owner of the resort.</i>


272
00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.780
<i>A Dr. Martin Halifax,
a guy who is very into ornithology.</i>


273
00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.580
<i>Bird collecting. 
I had to look it up, too.</i>

274
00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.780
<i>They met at his mansion in Malibu,
California. A very swanky place.</i>


275
00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.820
Detective Lavery? 
If there's nothing else...

276
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:27.540
Okay. Well, then, I guess I'm off
to your SandM fantasy island.


277
00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.020
Where the little guy runs around yelling,
The pain! The pain!


278
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.540
You're not mocking my work, are you?
- No, sir.


279
00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.980
In fact, how did you happen to start
this resort of yours?


280
00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.100
I believe there's always been a need
for such a place.


281
00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:47.900
There are many people with similar tastes but
with limited opportunities to discuss...


282
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.100
...or fulfill them.

283
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.740
I guess you're right, there.
All you got is your peeler bars...


284
00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.940
...your sicko handcuff clubs,
weirdo newspaper ads...


285
00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.060
But none offers an environment
safe from disease or violence.


286
00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.460
In this era of fringe-group lunacy,
shouldn't we preserve freedom of choice...


287
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.460
...in the most intimate of all choices? Sex.

288
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.820
Everybody up on deck! This is Eden!

289
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.220
Mistress, the boats here.

290
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.540
Paddle!

291
00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.100
Lets go! Okay, move it!

292
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.340
You okay?

293
00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.020
Keep in time!

294
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.580
Keep your heads down!

295
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:07.020
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the new citizens are arriving.</i>


296
00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.500
<i>They beg for your examination.</i>

297
00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.620
<i>I'm Trainer Kindra,
and I'm pleased to announce that today...</i>


298
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.660
<i>...we have a new group of citizens for
everyone's use and approval.</i>


299
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.580
<i>As you choose them, they also choose you.</i>

300
00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:29.220
<i>All our pairings, whether married couples
or singles, are by mutual consent.</i>


301
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.860
<i>Our head trainer Richard
will introduce them.</i>


302
00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:36.100
<i>But first, our headmistress of Eden,
Mistress Lisa.</i>


303
00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.180
I could carry you around like that, too.

304
00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.940
All this ceremony and ritual
makes me so aroused.


305
00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.020
Why are we in a tent?

306
00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:16.620
Sometimes planes and helicopters fly
overhead and try to see what were doing.


307
00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.140
What are we doing?

308
00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:20.620
Quiet, Riba.

309
00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.660
<i>You will now meet
each candidate individually...</i>


310
00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:35.260
<i>...and, as is custom here at Eden, they will
then pay homage to Mistress Lisa.</i>


311
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.660
<i>First, we have Lars from Sweden.</i>

312
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.980
Oh, my God.

313
00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.460
<i>Julie. Atlanta, Georgia.</i>

314
00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.100
<i>Dante. Anaheim, 
California.</i>

315
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.860
<i>Riba, from Fort Worth, Texas.</i>

316
00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.700
<i>Jenny. Australia.</i>

317
00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:24.780
This isn't quite what I expected.
I gotta get out of here.


318
00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.180
You cant. The boat already left.

319
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.500
<i>Naomi, from Memphis, 
Tennessee.</i>

320
00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.540
<i>Elliot, from Australia
and Los Angeles, California.</i>


321
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.660
Lets go, Citizen Elliot.
- You go.


322
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.220
I'm not going up there.
- Yes, you are.


323
00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.580
I'm not going up.
<i>- Elliot Slater.</i>


324
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.500
Take it off, baby.

325
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:55.860
Okay, that's enough. Here's your robe.
Lets go, Slater.


326
00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.020
Thank you very much.

327
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.420
It feels like a sponge cake.

328
00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.420
Quite a showoff, aren't you, Elliot?

329
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.180
Individuality is an admirable trait.

330
00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.420
But not here. I think you need
a couple of days to realize...


331
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.940
...you're nobody special in Eden.
Turn around.


332
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.900
Put him on work detail. 
Take him away.

333
00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.780
<i>Heidi, from Fargo, 
North Dakota.</i>

334
00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:54.340
<i>$3 million worth of stolen diamonds were
confiscated after a shootout...</i>


335
00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.460
<i>...that left two suspects still at large.</i>

336
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.740
Now that you've found us,
don't be a stranger.


337
00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:05.540
You know, you're gonna be surprised
how much use you get out of that.


338
00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:09.620
<i>On June 16, suspects Nina and Omar
were seen at a specialized clothing store...</i>


339
00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:14.300
<i>...on Sunset Blvd. Apparently, they found
out where Slater's ship was headed, too.</i>


340
00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:18.500
<i>Fred and I arrived at the shop
minutes later.</i>


341
00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.340
Come on, Lucky.

342
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.620
<i>Fred was his usual adventuresome self.
Let's face it.</i>


343
00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.820
<i>A wild night for Fred
is a Doris Day film festival.</i>


344
00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:32.100
No blowup toys, no vibrators, no gels,
no creams, no cuffs, no tapes.


345
00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.300
How about some clothes?
- No, actually.


346
00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.340
I'm just here with him. 
Its his thing.

347
00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.300
A lot of people feel nervous...

348
00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.860
...about this
submissive-dominant thing at first.


349
00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:48.220
But, you know, really,
the submissive person is always in control.


350
00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:51.620
All you have to do
is give your partner a little control word.


351
00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:53.460
Like yellow.

352
00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.860
Yellow. Yellow! Fred!

353
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.420
Look! Bondage Man.

354
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.260
Its like <i>Elvis Goes to Hell</i>.

355
00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.300
Ill be the guest.
- Ill be the maintenance man.


356
00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.500
Lets get started.

357
00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.780
Lots of men like
to hear women talk dirty.

358
00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.500
Lets hear someone talk dirty.

359
00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:49.260
Any volunteers? 
How about you?

360
00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.780
No, I couldn't.
- Come on. Just try.


361
00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:57.500
That's why you're here.
Say something hot to your lover in bed.


362
00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.900
All right.

363
00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.740
Come on, put your thing in my thing.

364
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.300
Its a start.

365
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.180
One, two, three.

366
00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:20.420
And finally, the experts predict,
to survive intimacy in the year 2000...


367
00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.660
...women will learn to be more sexually
aggressive, and men, more romantic.


368
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.860
Our time is up. Thank you. Zara?

369
00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.460
Thank you, Mistress Lisa.

370
00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:34.660
Now, if you'd all come with me,
well go on to the next class.


371
00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.580
That was a wonderful lecture.

372
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:40.220
- Do you have a book out? - No,
we like to keep it kind of private here.


373
00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.980
I understand. Id better catch up. Bye.

374
00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.620
There he is again.
- Yeah.


375
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.860
What do you think of her? Shes cool.

376
00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.740
<i>Elliot Slater.</i>

377
00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:05.460
Slater was intrigued by erotica
but was reticent to try it until now.


378
00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.500
I think we can help him.

379
00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.980
There he is.

380
00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:11.620
Read the whole bio.

381
00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.740
Born in Australia and grew up
in California's San Fernando Valley.


382
00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.300
That must make for an interesting accent.

383
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.860
What the hell's he doing?

384
00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:28.100
Hes an award-winning photojournalist
whose specialty is combat photography.


385
00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.180
They say hes fearless.

386
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.940
Hes never been trained.

387
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.300
Fast-forward to the end of the interview.

388
00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.260
<i>But one more thing.</i>

389
00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.460
<i>What?
- You didn't list your sexual fantasies.</i>


390
00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.580
<i>You do have sexual fantasies?</i>

391
00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.700
<i>Doesn't everybody?</i>

392
00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.420
<i>Be honest. You're not comfortable
talking about them.</i>


393
00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.860
<i>Not really.
That's why I want to go to the island.</i>


394
00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.380
<i>Who else sees this tape?
Does everybody get interviewed like this?</i>


395
00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:05.660
Hes going to be work.
Ill train him myself.


396
00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.460
When you get to the island,
find this Slater character...


397
00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:13.060
...and stick to him like glue.

398
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.220
We don't want Slater to know
hes the bait.


399
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.380
No, he could panic.

400
00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:19.460
If we tell him we need the film,
well know what Omar looks like.


401
00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.500
Hes smart. I don't want to chance it.

402
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:25.340
If Omar even suspects that the police
are involved, he could disappear.


403
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.940
It wont be hard to spot Nina.

404
00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:29.340
How many tall black women are there
in the world?


405
00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:30.900
Hey, Sheila.
- Hey, Martha.


406
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:35.220
Dr. Halifax has sent your plane tickets.
When you get there...


407
00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.420
What are you doing?
- Its wigs, Lieutenant.


408
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:41.220
For undercover on the island. In case
they recognize me from the strip club.


409
00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:44.220
How? You were already in disguise
in your stripper cover.


410
00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.020
I pointed that out to her, sir.

411
00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.740
Debbie Gibson?

412
00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:50.140
In a less-than-perfect world.

413
00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:54.540
If you find Nina,
I only want you to observe her...


414
00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.540
...because we could also use her
to get to Omar. I want Omar.


415
00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:58.820
You got it.

416
00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:02.020
Florence Henderson?
- No, Mrs. Brady on a binge.


417
00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.020
Your itineraries are with your tickets.

418
00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.620
Pay attention. Look at me.

419
00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.860
I'm listening.

420
00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.660
Watch your expense accounts.
You're cops, not politicians.


421
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.300
Good luck.
- Roger.


422
00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.620
Last one, Fred. You call it.

423
00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:19.860
Julio Iglesias, Sasquatch, road-kill...
Just do your New York thing.


424
00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:21.020
All right.

425
00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.860
<i>While I was trying to cover
my stringy hair with wigs...</i>


426
00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.900
<i>...Omar and Nina were charming
their way to the island.</i>


427
00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.020
So, that's the favor.
You owe me one, Priscilla.


428
00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.980
But Dr. Halifax sends me
some of my best clients.


429
00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.660
Mistress Priscilla,
I'm ready to be punished.


430
00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.260
Look, I have to go to work.

431
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.500
<i>Omar had 30 years
in the smuggling business...</i>


432
00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.220
<i>...with no arrests
and no photos ever taken.</i>


433
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.220
<i>He wanted to retire with a clean slate.</i>

434
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.460
<i>He was obsessed with getting Slater's film.</i>

435
00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:47.620
Look.

436
00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.780
You get me on that next guest list
that's going to that island.


437
00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.500
<i>I'm sorry about Mom.</i>

438
00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:06.020
Are you going to be okay, Dad?
- Hell, of course I am.


439
00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.380
It just isn't fair.
- Of course its fair.


440
00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.100
People die.

441
00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.260
She was 52 years old.

442
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:16.540
It was her time.

443
00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:21.180
Come on, get in the cab.
I'm sure the meters running.


444
00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:29.180
Ill call you.

445
00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.340
Bye, dad.

446
00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.100
Mistress, hes waiting.

447
00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.820
Is something wrong?
You haven't said a word to me all night.


448
00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.500
I'm just thinking.

449
00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.060
Thinking about your mother?

450
00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.100
No, my father, actually.

451
00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:14.980
At my mothers funeral, he didn't cry.
I've never seen him cry.


452
00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:16.940
Eyes straight.

453
00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.940
Lets talk about something prettier.

454
00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.140
He is attractive.

455
00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:24.980
Especially those eyes.

456
00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:28.100
I wouldn't know, Mistress.
I cant see his eyes.


457
00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.500
Come on, its cold.

458
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.220
Don't look.

459
00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:50.620
Come here, I want to sit down.

460
00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:54.140
Where?
- No talking.


461
00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:56.860
No.

462
00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.420
Very good, Pretty Eyes.

463
00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:11.900
Now I'm going to let you feel
what you so very much wanted to see.


464
00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.620
You want me to rock?

465
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.460
Bring him to my room tomorrow night.

466
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:42.100
<i>June 17, we arrived on a privately-owned
island just off the coast of Mexico...</i>


467
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.260
<i>...called Eden.</i>

468
00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.740
<i>I thought Id seen everything.
Well, I hadn't.</i>


469
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.500
New guests,
please sign in at the hospitality tent.


470
00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.700
Its all right. Our citizens will
take care of your luggage for you.


471
00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.460
It'll be at your accommodations.

472
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:59.060
<i>The citizens traveled by boat,
and the guests on chartered planes.</i>


473
00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.660
<i>Both paid big bucks
for what I was doing free.</i>


474
00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:05.020
Hi, we didn't meet. I'm Bettiann,
and this is my husband Jeffrey.


475
00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.220
Hi. Lucy Smith. How are you?
- Fine.


476
00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.900
I'm a dental hygienist.
- Really?


477
00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.180
Do you floss?
- Yes.


478
00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.300
Step right through to the hospitality tent.

479
00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.860
Because you have no tartar buildup.
- Tartar? Really?


480
00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:20.060
This is gonna be fun, huh, Bettiann?
- Wonderful, beautiful.


481
00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.820
Were in for a treat. 
I can feel it.

482
00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:33.700
Bob Greenway.

483
00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:38.740
Welcome, Master. I'm here to please you.
- Ill do anything to give you pleasure.


484
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.900
Wait! Hes just an employee.

485
00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:43.940
Your transportation is over there, sir.

486
00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.140
What can I do for you, Master?
- Carry my bag.


487
00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.500
Thank you.

488
00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.380
I'm here to serve you.

489
00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:52.860
Use me any way you wish.

490
00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.220
I'm here to make your body tingle.
- Is that so?


491
00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:59.900
I believe that's my transportation.
Bob Greenway, air-conditioning mechanic.


492
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:05.060
<i>Ou est ma reservation? Merde!
- Madame Randy, c'est pas dans Le registre.</i>


493
00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.180
<i>Votre nom n'est pas ici.
- Madame Randy.</i>


494
00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:10.820
<i>Mais, non. Attendez une seconde.
Voila, je I'ai trouv�e.</i>


495
00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.220
<i>Idiote!</i>

496
00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.140
May I please you?

497
00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:16.980
If you can handle it.

498
00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:22.820
Can I just follow the... Okay, III just...

499
00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:27.740
Last year, I was in a hotel in Miami
next to the elevator and the ice machine.


500
00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.220
What a nightmare.

501
00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:30.660
All night.

502
00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:32.540
Meet you at the room.
- Fine.


503
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.820
Excuse me, am I near the ice machine?
- No, maam, we make it by hand.


504
00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.980
I will not tolerate being near an--
- Would you please be careful?


505
00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:42.020
Do I get the same person all the time,
or do they rotate?


506
00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:45.020
Kitty is one of our best citizens.
She finished training early.


507
00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.420
Okay, in.

508
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.860
There are no locks on the doors.
Nothing to hide here at Eden.


509
00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.900
Hotel phones are room-to-room only.

510
00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.740
Emergency calls can be made
from the office.


511
00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.140
Ill be your personal citizen,
if it pleases you.


512
00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:05.540
Thrilled.

513
00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.540
I have a little specialty.

514
00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.620
Specialty?

515
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.820
Look, I'm a new maintenance man.
I'm not a guest here.


516
00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.980
So I don't have to do
the kinky stuff, right?


517
00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:24.220
I'm a doctor, and everybody
on this island gets a physical.


518
00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.220
I'm checking for hernias. 
Drop your shorts.

519
00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.260
Turn your head and cough.

520
00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:37.380
Cough.

521
00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:41.020
Turn your head the other way. Cough.

522
00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.260
That's a good boy.

523
00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.940
Or should I say big boy?

524
00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.340
I'm on the job here.
- Me, too.


525
00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.700
I have to be at Mistress Lisas
in five minutes.


526
00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:15.020
Shes having a little welcoming tea
for the new guests. Ladies only.


527
00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.300
Well discuss intimate things.
- Lucky you.


528
00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.220
You think that was Nina on the plane?

529
00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.500
The tall, yellow outfit
shouting at everybody in French?


530
00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:24.540
I don't think so. Too obvious.

531
00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:27.220
Better keep your eye out
for any other possible Ninas.


532
00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:30.300
Excuse me.
- I've got a list of chores. Oil sex chair.


533
00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:34.860
Wait. I know you're new, but maintenance
people are not allowed to talk to guests.


534
00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:37.260
I was just asking if
there was a gift shop.

535
00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.300
I need to get some tampons.
- Definitely.


536
00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.020
Super-absorbency? With odor control?
- All that.


537
00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.460
Perfect.
- Right this way.


538
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.940
Thank you.

539
00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.180
Could you connect me with Mrs. Randy?

540
00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:51.860
<i>Elliot wasn't among the regular citizens.
He was nowhere to be found.</i>


541
00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.180
<i>While Nina and Omar
were plotting to find him...</i>


542
00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.740
<i>...I checked in to the coffee klatch.</i>

543
00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.140
Go on, Nancy.

544
00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.860
So after 20 years,
he tells me what his sexual fantasies are.


545
00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.540
I tell him what my sexual fantasies are.

546
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:09.460
It turns out that they're incredibly similar,
except that now its too late...


547
00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:13.180
...because were in the middle of
a divorce. Such a waste of time...


548
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.780
...and good sex.

549
00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:19.140
Again, you must discuss
your sexual fantasies with your partner.


550
00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.100
Are you gonna eat that?

551
00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:24.220
Any other questions?
- Yes, I have two.


552
00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.900
First, do your parents know you do this?

553
00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:31.700
They think that I
work at a four-star resort.

554
00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.700
Which this is, kind of.

555
00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:38.020
Okay, and second, how do you decide
you wanna be a dominatrix?


556
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:42.380
What do you, wake up one day
and go, Hey, I feel like being bossy?


557
00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:43.740
No...

558
00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.060
I don't mean to pry.
You don't have to tell me.


559
00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:47.940
No, its all right.

560
00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:52.180
I remember once, there was this birthday
party in high school for the quarterback...


561
00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.740
...and I volunteered to be the present.

562
00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.620
He never talked to me again.

563
00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.700
I just wanted everybody to like me.

564
00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:07.180
I didn't even know the guy.
And there were a few others like him.


565
00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:09.540
But that all changed
when I went to college.


566
00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.980
What did you take, Spanking 101?

567
00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:14.540
Well, it wasn't on the curriculum.

568
00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:18.460
Its where I met this professor.
- And Mary Ann...


569
00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.140
<i>Gilligan's Island</i>?
- My favorite show.


570
00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.540
I'm sorry. <i>Conversation interruptus</i>.
<i>Continuous,</i> please.


571
00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.460
No, it was an English professor.

572
00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:31.420
You see, I went to this very small,
conservative school.


573
00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:35.380
<i>And when I was a graduate student,
I wrote a paper on</i> Pride and Prejudice.


574
00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:39.820
In conclusion, it is apparent that Elizabeth
exhibited the qualities of a submissive.


575
00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.820
She completely gave herself to her man,
and in doing so...


576
00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:44.820
...forgot her own emotional pain.

577
00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:50.140
You're really busy. I should go.

578
00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:51.780
Put down your books.

579
00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:57.820
Now take off your sweater.

580
00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.180
You took off your clothes in his office?
I could never do that.


581
00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:05.060
Even at home, I take off my clothes in the
bathroom, then I jump into bed quickly.


582
00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:06.980
Which is weird, because I live alone.

583
00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:10.620
You see, I was a victim.
I would have done anything he asked.


584
00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:13.220
And it wasn't about sex.
He never touched me.


585
00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.620
<i>He seemed to understand
what I was going through.</i>


586
00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:20.300
And he arranged for me
to meet a friend of his...


587
00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.820
...who specialized in erotica.

588
00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:27.020
<i>So a large, black limousine
picked me up at school...</i>


589
00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:31.500
<i>...and took me to a beautiful mansion
with a gigantic iron gate.</i>


590
00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.860
<i>I was given a note that said,
"Go into the living room...</i>


591
00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:40.260
<i>"...take off your clothes,
put on the blindfold, and wait for me."</i>


592
00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.980
Hello, my beauty.

593
00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:30.020
Which one would you like?

594
00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.940
I need to hear what your fantasy is.

595
00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:38.980
I'm here to create an illusion for you,
only the illusion.


596
00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:42.980
I am a top, a master.

597
00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.820
You are a bottom, a submissive.

598
00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:47.900
Yet, were not different.

599
00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:51.220
Were in unison to please each other.

600
00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.140
Just tell me your wishes.

601
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.780
And welcome to my world.

602
00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:59.740
I didn't know such a world existed.

603
00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:02.900
Its a world in which
you have all the choices.


604
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.820
Can I choose to be master?

605
00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:11.540
The best submissives usually become
the best masters.


606
00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:15.780
You're a victim in life. I will teach you
to always be in total control.


607
00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:18.980
You will never be a victim again, ever.

608
00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:33.860
Never.

609
00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:47.260
Ever.

610
00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:53.460
<i>I liked being in control. 
It felt safe.</i>

611
00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.420
But isn't there a happy medium?

612
00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:59.780
Like, I tie you up one night,
you tie me up the next night?


613
00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:03.740
Of course, it would be nice
not to be in control and still feel safe.


614
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:04.860
Have you ever?

615
00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.900
Anyway, Diana.

616
00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:14.940
I look forward to seeing you all
during your visit.


617
00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:19.500
My favorite <i>Gilligan</i> episode?
Kurt Russell as the monkey boy.


618
00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.980
He was cute, even then.
- I love that one! Do you remember that?


619
00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.740
Kurt Russell was on the island.
No one knew he was there.


620
00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.340
Follow me,
III lead you to our fantasy emporium...


621
00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:30.540
...where you can choose
one of our fantasies.


622
00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:31.780
That sounds fun.

623
00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.780
I had a fantasy about Skipper once.

624
00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:36.340
Remember Skipper?
He was chubby, but he was cute.


625
00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:45.900
And we can also arrange for this fantasy
called Love With a Stranger.


626
00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.380
Or Having Sex With a Mysterious Lover.

627
00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:51.060
A popular fantasy,
especially among women.


628
00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:54.340
No commitment.
No wishing the guy calls the next day.


629
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:58.860
No shame or guilt. It wasn't your fault.
You were seduced.


630
00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.220
And you didn't even know his name.

631
00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:06.020
Now, if you'll follow me.

632
00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:08.980
And this is another of Edens fantasies.

633
00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:13.300
Enjoying the pleasure of total
submissiveness to voice dominance.


634
00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:16.700
And being titillated by command
is nothing to be ashamed of.


635
00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:19.300
Here we show the secretary
dominating the boss...


636
00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.100
...as one of the most common
command fantasies.


637
00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:25.060
Mr. Vanderway, what do you want?
It's my lunch hour.


638
00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.420
Do these documents over again in italics.

639
00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:30.300
And give me that letter immediately.
- No.


640
00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:31.940
What?

641
00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.460
Come crawl over here for it.
- Crawl?


642
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:38.340
Mr. Vanderway, I want you to get down
on your hands and knees...


643
00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:40.420
...and crawl for my letter.

644
00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.460
Yes, Miss Perkins.

645
00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:47.980
Good boss.

646
00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:53.340
As Mr. Vanderway obeys, they both
examine the shadows of safe, sane...


647
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:55.780
...and submissive sexuality.

648
00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:58.740
Our next fantasy is popular
with both sexes.


649
00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:00.340
Sex in Public.

650
00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:03.940
The excitement of getting caught.

651
00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.540
How many floors does it take
you to make love?


652
00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:09.420
In what position do you make love
in an elevator?


653
00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:10.780
Lets see.

654
00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:17.500
It seems our Sex in Public fantasy
is out of order.


655
00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.900
Now, if you'll follow me,
well see enactments of the Roman bath.


656
00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:24.860
I do it all the time. Its a real kick.
Trust me.


657
00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:27.900
Roman baths.
- I once had a terrible toothache in Rome.


658
00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:30.260
Can you tell me
where I can find Citizen Elliot?


659
00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:32.660
Were not supposed to talk about...

660
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:36.580
<i>I didn't know it at the time, but Omar was
actually on my Fantasy Emporium tour.</i>


661
00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.900
<i>If she didn't stop asking me
about her teeth...</i>


662
00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:40.580
<i>...I was gonna have to kill her.</i>

663
00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:44.060
No sign of Elliot, but two possible Ninas.
How are you doing?


664
00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:48.620
All right. This island is way over the top.
Man, what a bunch of oddballs.


665
00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:52.500
Will you lighten up? They're just
expressing what most people suppress.


666
00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:56.540
On account of it should be suppressed.
- Why? They're not hurting anybody.


667
00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:00.500
Look, there are some things in life
that are just better left undone.


668
00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:02.980
Why cant these people think about it...

669
00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:05.820
...instead of talking and acting out,
for heavens sake.


670
00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:08.140
It probably gets them past
the game-playing?


671
00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:10.500
There was a very interesting scene
over there.


672
00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.940
There was a business man,
this secretary came in--


673
00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:15.140
What are you saying?
You're being sucked in--


674
00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:16.260
Excuse me.
- Yes.


675
00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:19.260
Everyone's got to keep up with the group.
- I'm so sorry.


676
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.660
I think the maintenance man has
a little crush on me.


677
00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:27.340
<i>Lt. Malone had said
to look for strange behavior.</i>


678
00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:29.780
<i>Well, here, it was hard to tell.</i>

679
00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:32.540
<i>The rest of the day, 
I looked for Omar.</i>

680
00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:34.700
<i>Omar looked for Elliot.</i>

681
00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:38.300
<i>My "God, I'm good" partner, Fred,
concluded that the obvious Mrs. Randy...</i>


682
00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:40.140
<i>...was, in fact, Nina.</i>

683
00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:42.380
<i>He watched her,
hoping shed lead us to Omar.</i>


684
00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:45.140
<i>We came up empty,
because Elliot was on the other side...</i>


685
00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:46.980
<i>...of the island doing work detail.</i>

686
00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:50.100
<i>So I decided to
treat myself to a massage.</i>

687
00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:51.580
Tommy. Lower.

688
00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:53.620
Lower?
- In fact, no, higher.


689
00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:55.380
What the hell? 
Any way you like.

690
00:49:56.180 --> 00:50:00.220
<i>Mistress Lisa actually ran a nice place.
She designed all the clothes herself.</i>


691
00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:02.620
<i>Her idea was to create these outfits
that were...</i>


692
00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:05.020
<i>...as far away from reality as possible.</i>

693
00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:08.100
<i>Our first day on the island,
and we made no progress.</i>


694
00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:12.180
<i>Fred took the night shift
and almost got electrocuted.</i>


695
00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:16.500
<i>As for me,
I went to bed quietly with a book.</i>


696
00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:24.580
Hey! No panting after 2:00 a.m.!

697
00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:27.300
<i>Turned out to be a busy night
around the island.</i>


698
00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:30.140
<i>Mistress Lisa's lights were on pretty late.</i>

699
00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.420
Stand here and face the fireplace.

700
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:36.460
Wait.

701
00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:51.620
Don't be so nosy.

702
00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:55.420
Come in here.

703
00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.140
Take off that robe.

704
00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:18.940
Bathe me.

705
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:36.980
I wanna know you.

706
00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:39.540
I don't even know your last name.

707
00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:41.540
Tell me.

708
00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:48.140
You have to go along with the illusion,
or else it doesn't work.


709
00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:51.820
Now bathe me.

710
00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:18.980
You know how some men
like women's legs?


711
00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.180
Some like big breasts.

712
00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:24.740
Some like long hair.

713
00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:28.380
You know what I like?

714
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:32.780
I like butts.

715
00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:36.940
Men's beautiful behinds.

716
00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:41.580
You know what I like to do
to gorgeous butts?


717
00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:47.780
I like to squeeze them, pinch them...

718
00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:50.460
...and caress them.

719
00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:54.980
You know what else I love?

720
00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:04.860
I like to rub my bare breasts...

721
00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:08.580
...down your back...

722
00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:11.500
...and over your butt.

723
00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:18.060
You like that, don't you?

724
00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:23.300
You know what I like the best?

725
00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:29.020
What I like best is...

726
00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:35.220
You like that, don't you?
- No.


727
00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.300
Oh, yes.

728
00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.980
You are going to be punished
with pleasure.


729
00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:46.860
I've heard you're fearless...

730
00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:49.260
...that nothing scares you.

731
00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:55.660
Please, don't blindfold me.

732
00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:59.700
I'm covering your eyes, so you can
concentrate on what you're feeling.


733
00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:01.340
You like that.

734
00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:04.180
Tell me you like that.
- No.


735
00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:11.620
You like that?
Being punished by a woman?


736
00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:12.700
No.

737
00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:14.940
I think you like it.
- No.


738
00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:18.180
I give you permission
to like it. Tell me.

739
00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:20.100
No. I don't like it.

740
00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:56.500
You like that?

741
00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:00.900
Do you want me to stop?
- No.


742
00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:02.780
Do you like it?

743
00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:05.740
Tell me, or III stop.

744
00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:07.380
Tell me.

745
00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:08.540
Yes.

746
00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:10.420
Louder. I cant hear you.
- I cant.


747
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.060
Why?
- I don't know.


748
00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:14.460
Are you ashamed of it?
- Yes.


749
00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:18.300
Its all right, Elliot. You can say it.
You can like it.


750
00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:22.260
You're allowed here. 
Do you like it?

751
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.260
Tell me. Do you like it?

752
00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:28.340
Yes.

753
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:33.780
I do like it.

754
00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:37.460
That's it.

755
00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:39.780
Let it go.

756
00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:44.380
Good.

757
00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:52.580
Its okay, baby.

758
00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:56.940
Let it out.

759
00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:02.100
<i>Can I stay here tonight?</i>

760
00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:04.580
Yes.

761
00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:08.820
On the floor, Citizen Elliot.

762
00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:13.740
Would you like a pillow?
- No, thank you.


763
00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:17.260
Good night.

764
00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:18.660
Lisa...

765
00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:21.220
Good night.

766
00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:44.260
Lucy. Sorry.

767
00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:47.500
Tommy. I cant believe
they don't have locks on this door.


768
00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:48.900
What are you doing here?

769
00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:52.380
I saw you with that mask, and I thought
you wanted to play bandit girl.


770
00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:54.060
No.
- Come on.


771
00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:57.940
Ill let you capture me.
- No, actually, this is a sleeping mask.


772
00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:01.780
See those tiki torches out there?
I felt like I was on an airport runway.


773
00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:06.180
Are there any other fun games
you might wanna play?


774
00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:10.380
Sleeping. Sleeping's fun for me.
I'm gonna get back to it right now, in fact.


775
00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:14.020
I'm gonna dream about fantasies that
maybe we can do some other time, okay?


776
00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:15.380
All right.

777
00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:17.780
Lucy?
- Yes?


778
00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:20.940
I could sleep on the floor by you
and wake you up in the morning.


779
00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:23.820
I don't really need a human alarm clock.

780
00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:25.700
I could use a human door lock.

781
00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:29.780
Why don't you go lay in front of the door,
and you can play guard boy?


782
00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:31.900
Guard boy. I can do that.
- You like that?


783
00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:33.980
All right, Tommy. Go ahead. Run along.

784
00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:35.820
You got it.
- See you in the morning.


785
00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:37.700
Ill be stepping over you. Okay.

786
00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:39.100
Bye.
- Good to see you.


787
00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:41.180
Thanks for stopping in.

788
00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:47.220
This pleasure island
is starting to get to me.


789
00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:52.900
Its affecting my work now.
Like today, I mean, I went berserk.


790
00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:55.220
<i>Nobody seemed to care.</i>

791
00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:57.420
<i>Their sex sensors are numb.</i>

792
00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:02.380
Well, the flesh is weak.

793
00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:06.900
And I think about other things
to distract myself.


794
00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:09.700
Small-engine repair.

795
00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:57.540
Elliot, I was just dreaming.

796
01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:05.780
What are you doing?

797
01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.300
Allow me to please you.

798
01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:12.900
You don't have to do anything.
Just let me please you.


799
01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:13.900
Elliot.

800
01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:47.260
Yes.

801
01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:53.380
<i>What are you doing?
- I'm kissing you. Do you mind?</i>


802
01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:57.580
You know, its like, you see the flesh
all the time, the nakedness.


803
01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:02.260
But is the anticipation more exciting,
or the actual naked flesh itself?


804
01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:06.940
Trying to sort it all out.
A little confused.


805
01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:13.220
I don't care. I'm reading the last page.

806
01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:57.420
Lisa Emerson.

807
01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:17.620
Why did I tell him my name?

808
01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:25.220
<i>Our second day on the island
was Sports Day.</i>


809
01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.340
Faster, come on.

810
01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:37.460
Peanuts. Fresh peanuts over here.

811
01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:41.780
<i>The roller race is open to guests,
trainers and citizens.</i>


812
01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:45.180
<i>The victor will win a private audience
with Mistress Lisa.</i>


813
01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:48.220
<i>Exhibition tennis is available
on the upper level.</i>


814
01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:50.460
<i>We hope you all participate in Sports Day.</i>

815
01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:55.460
All right, Lucy. Show em what you got.
- Come on, serve it.


816
01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:58.700
That's the man. I got it.

817
01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:02.500
Erotic art here. 
Art through the ages.

818
01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:06.060
Ben Wah balls!

819
01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:08.140
What are they used for?
- Can I buy that?


820
01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:11.740
Marital aids, marital aids,
come vibrate with me.


821
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.980
Wanna punish me for those two points?

822
01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:31.020
No, I think Id like to go down
to the beach now.


823
01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:34.140
Hey, how are you doing?
- All right.


824
01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.980
Kicked ass in volleyball.
- I knew you had it in you.


825
01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.780
Its tough to spike in curtains.

826
01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:41.100
My mother had that pattern
in her living room.


827
01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:43.100
Have you seen Slater around?
- No.


828
01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:46.020
We gotta solve this case soon,
because hanging around here...


829
01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:48.820
...I am so horny. 
You ever get horny?

830
01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:49.860
In high school.

831
01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:52.460
I am getting so aroused.
- Spare me.


832
01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:55.900
Is this really where were all headed?

833
01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.380
Some, yes. Some of us, no.

834
01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:58.620
You're a hit.
- What?


835
01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:01.580
Everyone's talking about you.
They want you in the ring toss.


836
01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:03.940
What?
- Something about your physical. Big boy?


837
01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:06.020
Get out of here.
- I'm getting aggressive.


838
01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:08.220
I'm requesting Citizen Elliot to my room.

839
01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:11.100
I'm on the job. Ill see you later.
- Ill be weeding.


840
01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:14.180
Fix that gong. I'm sick of seeing
broken gongs all over this island.


841
01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:17.380
<i>Citizen Julie,
report to the sticky-buns booth.</i>


842
01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.780
That's me. Excuse me. On my way.

843
01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:26.420
Big boy, huh?

844
01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:32.900
End of the line, maam.

845
01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:36.380
<i>Id heard from my slave man, Tommy,
that the people in work detail...</i>


846
01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:38.820
<i>...were being let off
to participate in Sports Day.</i>


847
01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.460
<i>I thought there was finally a chance
to request Slater.</i>


848
01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:43.260
Come in.

849
01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:48.540
This is Citizen Elliot, as you requested.
- Thank you.


850
01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.260
Hi.
- Hello.


851
01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:52.300
Lucy.

852
01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:54.780
What would you like to do?
Perhaps a massage?


853
01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:58.220
This is my first time. I was hoping
maybe we could talk first.


854
01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:01.060
Do you think we
could do this after lunch?

855
01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:03.620
Whats the matter,
cant talk on an empty stomach?


856
01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:07.260
No, its not that.
- Its my hair, isn't it?


857
01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:10.180
What?
- Its my hair. You can say.


858
01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:13.660
I can see it. Its limp. Its stringy.
Its not hanging right.


859
01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:18.380
No, not at all. You're very nice, Lucy.
Its just, well, the race is about to start.


860
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.540
Oh, that rollerblading thing.
Yes, I hear the announcements.


861
01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:23.940
Lucky me.
I get the room right next to the gong.


862
01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:25.540
I wanted to enter that race.

863
01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:29.700
Oh, really? Did you hear first prize?
You get to spend time with Mistress Lisa.


864
01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:32.100
Yeah, I want that privilege.

865
01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:36.740
You got a crush?
- We just got to know each other a little.


866
01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:38.780
You have a big crush.

867
01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.780
It sounds pretty corny.
- What?


868
01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:48.340
Just relax, breathe, pretend I'm Oprah.
Come on, you can tell me.


869
01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:49.780
Okay.

870
01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:54.020
Have you ever been with somebody
that actually made violin music...


871
01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:55.260
...play in your head?

872
01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:58.940
Skinny girls hear violins.
Not-so-skinny girls hear French horns.


873
01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:00.340
I know what you mean.

874
01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:02.740
Did you tell her?
- I wish I could.


875
01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:05.420
That's the problem, I cant.
I don't know how.


876
01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.740
I cant get close to her.
She wont talk to me.


877
01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:09.780
That's tough. You know, scary.

878
01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:12.220
You tell someone,
you don't know what they'll say.


879
01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:14.180
Once a year, I
go to the Grand Canyon.

880
01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:18.940
I scream, I like you, just so
I can hear back, I like you, I like you.


881
01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:22.500
<i>Attention skaters.
Last call for the Rollerblade race.</i>


882
01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:24.140
Go on, get out of here.

883
01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:27.380
I promise III come back.
- All right.


884
01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:28.940
Here, hold this.

885
01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:30.340
Hey, Elliot?
- Yeah?


886
01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:32.500
I hear you're a photographer.
- Yeah.


887
01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:34.620
Think you can take some pictures for me?

888
01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:38.820
No, they took my camera away from me
and stuck it in storage with my other stuff.


889
01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.260
I don't know where it is.

890
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:43.660
Really? Has anyone else requested you?
- No, I've been on work detail.


891
01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:46.020
Just curious. Go ahead. You're late.

892
01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:47.780
Thank you.
- Hey, Elliot?


893
01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:51.580
Be careful out there.
- Your hair is just fine.


894
01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:52.860
You think?

895
01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:59.660
A guy takes off his pants
to leave my room.


896
01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:02.660
Skaters, take your places.

897
01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:05.860
On your marks.

898
01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:08.580
Get set.
- Wait!


899
01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:11.220
And they're off.

900
01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:18.260
What the hell was that?
- Hey, wait! You forgot your number!


901
01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:31.540
<i>The race turned out to be
the turning point in the investigation.</i>


902
01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:32.900
Go, Elliot!

903
01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:39.740
<i>Slater was out there
for all the world to see, including Omar.</i>


904
01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:40.940
Come on!

905
01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:44.020
<i>Fred was supposed to cover the event,
but he had to feed the fish.</i>


906
01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:47.420
<i>If you ask me, they feed those fish
too much. Those are chubby koi.</i>


907
01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:01.300
<i>Elliot was no Olympic skater,
but he gave it his all.</i>


908
01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:13.580
Yes!

909
01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:15.260
He won.

910
01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.780
<i>The winner is Citizen...
- Citizen Elliot.</i>


911
01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:22.380
<i>Citizen Elliot. His number
must have been torn off from passion.</i>


912
01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:35.060
Here's your number.

913
01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:37.580
Its my lucky number.

914
01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:39.700
Riba, I'm sorry.
- Its okay.


915
01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:42.620
Are you ready for us?
Do you wanna do a threesome?


916
01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:44.220
Well, not really.

917
01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:47.660
Watching you two will be such a joy.
My names Tillington, from Guilford.


918
01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:50.020
Congratulations on the race.
You were very good.


919
01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:51.060
Thank you.

920
01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:54.060
Mistress Lisa...

921
01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:58.940
<i>After the race, Omar made his move.
And lucky for us, so did Mistress Lisa.</i>


922
01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:05.860
I think it would be a good idea.
- Good.


923
01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:09.540
I'm sorry. I cant allow this.
We don't permit voyeurism.


924
01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:11.500
But that's my fantasy.

925
01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:15.100
Citizen Elliot hasn't completed his training.

926
01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:18.140
Send him to his quarters.
- I don't mind if he hasn't finished.


927
01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:20.540
Now, Richard.
- Citizens quarters.


928
01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:23.780
Lets go, Citizen Elliot.
- I'm sorry, Mr...


929
01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:26.780
Tillington, from Guilford.
- From Guilford, that's right.


930
01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:30.020
I'm sure Kitty can find many ways
to please you.


931
01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:34.620
Yeah, lets go get Citizen Joy.
Shes really pretty, and shes got peanuts.


932
01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:36.420
I don't want peanuts.

933
01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:41.740
Do you have a problem with that, Richard?
- No, Mistress.


934
01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:43.460
If I may...

935
01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:46.300
You may not.

936
01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:55.380
Since when don't we permit voyeurism?

937
01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:59.100
Since Mistress Lisa started to get soft
on a citizen.


938
01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:02.940
We should give Elliot to a harsher guest.

939
01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:31.100
Come in.

940
01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:34.780
I'm sorry. Were not going to be able to
grant your request.


941
01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:36.660
Elliot Slater is with another guest.

942
01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:38.500
With who?
- Mrs. Randy.


943
01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:41.020
Sorry. Maybe tomorrow.

944
01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:57.700
Come in.

945
01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:04.900
Mrs. Randy,
Citizen Elliot is here for your pleasure.


946
01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:11.380
I guess I'm your fantasy.

947
01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:19.020
Quiet. Down on your knees.

948
01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:25.100
Kiss my thigh.

949
01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:26.620
Come on.

950
01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:33.500
God, you're so boring.
Cant you do anything right?


951
01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:37.260
Now, turn around.

952
01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.900
Were going to play a game,
a question game.


953
01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:47.780
And the question game has
only one question.


954
01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:52.060
Where is the camera?
- Hello?


955
01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:55.860
Is Elliot Slater...
What are you doing with him?


956
01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:59.300
Anything I like. Do you mind?
- As a matter of fact, I do.


957
01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:02.460
You see, I have a 2:30 appointment
with him. Hes mine.


958
01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:05.420
I got all dressed up in this outfit--
- Spare me the details.


959
01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:06.660
Get out of my room.

960
01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:08.740
Do you have a confirmation?

961
01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:13.020
A confirmation?
- Yes, a confirmation.


962
01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:14.380
No, I wasn't given one.

963
01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:17.700
Well, guess what? I was.
Your loss. Get with the program.


964
01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:19.460
You, with me, now.

965
01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:24.420
Get up. Take off the robe.
I like that thong thing. Walk tall.


966
01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:27.740
Tell me I look gorgeous from behind.

967
01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:33.420
You blew it again,
and this time you weren't even sneezing.


968
01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:37.580
You could have helped.
- No, you do the killing, I do the thinking.


969
01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.260
Now what?

970
01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:41.940
You stay here, and you wait.

971
01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:45.180
I know that New York girl.
I know that sound.


972
01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:48.380
Whats going on?
- Listen, I'm not a dental hygienist.


973
01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:51.620
My name is not Lucy Smith.
I did not come to this island to have fun.


974
01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.940
I came to this island for one reason.

975
01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:55.180
Elliot.
- Yeah?


976
01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:57.620
You are to go on work detail now.
- No. Hey!


977
01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:00.220
Mistress Lisa's orders
supersede everything.


978
01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.460
Andre will be happy
to find you a replacement.


979
01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:05.180
Well, I don't want a replacement!
I would like Elliot!


980
01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:08.620
Hey, Skin and Bones! You, 
Toothpick Girl!

981
01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:12.500
How can I fulfill your fantasy?

982
01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.660
Go paint my house.

983
01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:23.500
This fruit plate will be better for you.
- Thanks.


984
01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:26.540
Now, that's an outfit to crawl for.

985
01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:28.300
May I do my specialty?

986
01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:30.980
No, I don't feel like having my toes
sucked right now.


987
01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:32.420
You sure?
- Yes, I am.


988
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:33.980
Listen--
- May I feed you?


989
01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:36.660
No, you can answer
a question for me, though.


990
01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:40.460
If I wanted to find out where
Citizen Elliot was, how would I go about it?


991
01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:44.420
Are you gonna replace me?

992
01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:45.780
No, never.

993
01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:46.940
Then, why?

994
01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:49.900
I just need to talk to him.
Can you go get him for me?


995
01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:52.940
Right away.
- Yes, thank you.


996
01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:55.980
You know, its a
lot quicker if you walk.

997
01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:00.500
Look at this, he took out the seeds.

998
01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:03.580
Mistress!

999
01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:05.260
Here are his bags.

1000
01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:08.700
Tommy brought them from storage.
- Look at the way he packs.


1001
01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:14.620
Hes changing his clothes. He thinks this is
his special meeting for winning the race.


1002
01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:17.340
I made a fool
of myself at that race...

1003
01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:20.980
...hopping off my horse
like some jealous birdbrain.


1004
01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:23.620
Why didn't you stop me?
- I'm only a citizen.


1005
01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:25.820
I've trained hundreds of men and women.

1006
01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:28.540
I've created fantasies for them.

1007
01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:31.460
I've gotten them in touch with
their deepest feelings.


1008
01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.300
How come this photographers
gotten to me?


1009
01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:37.260
I'm only a citizen.
- Will you stop saying that?


1010
01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:42.340
You've watched me train, you're smart,
you're going to be a trainer yourself.


1011
01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:45.420
So tell me, what do you think?

1012
01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:51.180
Maybe this Elliot opened up
your feelings a little bit.


1013
01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:53.860
I don't want to hear that.
- Sorry.


1014
01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.140
Mistress Lisa?

1015
01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:04.740
I finally get to
spend some time with you...

1016
01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:06.540
...alone?

1017
01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:13.620
Why are my bags here? 
Am I moving in?

1018
01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:23.580
I have a very important job here...

1019
01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:26.020
...that I like, and I'm good at it.

1020
01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:30.500
And you have become
a disruptive influence.


1021
01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:33.980
Its my fault as
much as it is yours.

1022
01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:39.100
So, I'm afraid you have to leave Eden.
Here's your money back.


1023
01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:42.460
Diana will make arrangements
for you to get home.


1024
01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:44.700
Have a good trip.

1025
01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:54.980
Excuse me.

1026
01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:00.860
What happened between last night
and this morning?


1027
01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:04.900
Last night, you had a wonderful bondage
fantasy and I helped you accept it.


1028
01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:06.260
That's what we do here.

1029
01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:08.580
It wasn't real.
- Yes, but afterwards.


1030
01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:14.020
I'm a professional, and I let it get
personal, and that's why you have to leave.


1031
01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:16.180
One condition: you come with me.

1032
01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:18.780
I cant do that.
- Come on, I won the race.


1033
01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:22.020
You owe me time. Come with me.
We can go away for a weekend.


1034
01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:23.980
I have money.
- Elliot...


1035
01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:27.060
Diana says you love the South.
We can go to New Orleans.


1036
01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:29.380
You like New Orleans.
- I don't have time.


1037
01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:31.620
And I'm not interested
in relationship stuff.


1038
01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:34.300
Its not serious.
We can stay in separate rooms.


1039
01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:35.620
We just have fun.

1040
01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:39.180
We go away, we have fun,
and we see if you and I are real.


1041
01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:42.420
I cant believe
you want to deny what we feel.


1042
01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:43.900
You're so sweet.

1043
01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:44.980
Sweet?
- Yeah.


1044
01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:46.460
She says I'm sweet.

1045
01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:51.860
Sweet means III end up
in New Orleans alone, listening to a banjo.


1046
01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:53.620
All right, III think about it.

1047
01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:55.740
Okay.

1048
01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:02.660
We are going.

1049
01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.380
Diana?

1050
01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:11.740
I just brought Elliot's luggage to Mistress
Lisa. That means hes being sent away.


1051
01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:15.340
Sent away where?
- I don't know. Only she would know.


1052
01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:19.700
But if you're looking for two guys,
Citizen Lars is available.


1053
01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:20.900
Actually, no!

1054
01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:23.580
It's my dream just to make you happy.

1055
01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:27.100
Yeah, you and every man.
I really have to see Mistress Lisa.


1056
01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:29.140
That's my thigh there, Tom.

1057
01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:30.340
No, my breasts.

1058
01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:33.900
Okay, listen, why don't you take a shower?
How about that?


1059
01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:38.060
Maybe do some pushups, who knows?
Fix the room. It could use a little Spackle.


1060
01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:39.740
Don't you think?

1061
01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:43.340
Got to run. Love to stay and talk.
Ill be back before you can say fetish.


1062
01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:45.140
I hate these garters.

1063
01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:51.700
You like this?

1064
01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:55.260
Are you enjoying your stay on the island?

1065
01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:58.780
You know, the secrets to get involved,
to get with the program.


1066
01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:12.340
This better be important.

1067
01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:24.380
Is your mistress here?
- What?


1068
01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:31.020
Is your mistress here?
- No. She went to see Mistress Lisa.


1069
01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:33.060
Alone?
- Yes.


1070
01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:38.260
Take care of the get-with-the-program
girl, III go find our photographer.


1071
01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:40.620
Ill meet you out by the golf cart.

1072
01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:42.620
Pleasure to meet you.

1073
01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:48.060
That was nice.

1074
01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:55.580
This better be important. 
I'm a busy man.

1075
01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:57.380
Mistress Lisa took a cart.

1076
01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:00.820
So?
- She was with Citizen Elliot.


1077
01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:03.940
They had luggage,
they talked about New Orleans...


1078
01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:05.860
...they went toward her plane.

1079
01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:09.860
The whereabouts of Mistress Lisa
is privileged information.


1080
01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:14.260
Is that so? I'm a cop. LAPD.
Where is she?


1081
01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:17.060
She and Citizen Elliot left the island.
Whats wrong?


1082
01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:18.940
Nothing yet. Can you do me a favor?

1083
01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:21.500
Can you go get that new maintenance man,
that Marv...


1084
01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:23.300
Greenway. Utica, New York.
- Right.


1085
01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:25.700
Absolutely.
- Thank you very much.


1086
01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.500
Here we go.

1087
01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:36.220
Bingo.

1088
01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:58.700
Get off of me!

1089
01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:06.020
Whoa! <i>Pardonnez-moi</i>!

1090
01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:08.540
Shes trying to kill me, you idiot!

1091
01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:13.620
Cuff her!
- I don't have any cuffs!


1092
01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:16.140
The only two people on this island
without handcuffs!


1093
01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:18.340
Let me go!
- Wheres Slater?


1094
01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:20.780
He left with Lisa. 
No sign of Omar.

1095
01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:23.020
Tie her up.

1096
01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:24.740
Nina Blackstone...

1097
01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:28.220
Are you gonna tell us
where your partner is?


1098
01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:30.980
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm a guest here.


1099
01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:32.540
Right. Listen to me!

1100
01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:36.340
Don't bite him!
- Let me go! You've made a mistake!


1101
01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:37.540
You're under arrest.

1102
01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:40.340
Read her her rights.
- You have the right to remain silent.


1103
01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:43.420
Anything you say will be used against you.
- Stop it!


1104
01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:50.180
Keep your toes down!
- No!


1105
01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:51.540
No?
- No.


1106
01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:58.500
Now, that is something
I would not have been capable of.


1107
01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:01.180
My deductions are saying
Omar is still on this rock.


1108
01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:03.340
But we still don't
know what he looks like.

1109
01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:07.340
Yes, Id like to put a person-to-person call
through to New Orleans, please.


1110
01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:11.300
Will you stop a minute?
I'm trying to talk business.


1111
01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:13.700
We take him out on the Avenue tonight.

1112
01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:16.860
We all point to him and say,
Hey, there's Tom Cruise!


1113
01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:19.820
He sells his autograph,
and we split the money.


1114
01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:23.900
He doesn't look like Tom Cruise.
- My wife thinks he looks like Tom Cruise.


1115
01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:25.300
Speak.
<i>- Latte?</i>


1116
01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:26.660
Yeah.
<i>- Omar.</i>


1117
01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:30.100
Mr. Omar, how you doing?
My dad gets out on parole in four months.


1118
01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:33.380
<i>I'm driving his cab.</i>
- That's nice. You give him my best wishes.


1119
01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:36.580
I have to go to New Orleans
for a couple of days. I need a favor.


1120
01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:38.020
<i>You coming here? Great!</i>

1121
01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:40.780
<i>While we were turning Nina
over to the San Diego Police...</i>


1122
01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:43.620
<i>...Omar was making plans
to go kill Slater himself.</i>


1123
01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:47.900
<i>He hired a street-band musician,
Latte Chavez, to help until he arrived.</i>


1124
01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:52.980
All right, lets go to work.
- I know who it is. He looks like Brad Pitt.


1125
01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:55.100
He doesn't look like Brad Pitt either.

1126
01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:58.020
Brad Pitt? He looks like Tom Cruise!

1127
01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:12.820
You're an awful lot
of fun to be with.

1128
01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:14.180
I can be fun.

1129
01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:16.860
I just get paid to be mean.

1130
01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:24.020
Subjects A and B landed
in a white, twin-engine Cessna 421...


1131
01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:27.060
...changed clothes
at the River Terrace Hotel...


1132
01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:30.740
...and went immediately to Bourbon Street
with the rest of the yahoos.


1133
01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:32.340
Latte out.

1134
01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:37.540
Its Tom Cruise.
- Its not.


1135
01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:38.780
It is.
- Its not.


1136
01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:40.540
I swear it is.
- That's Brad Pitt.


1137
01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:42.140
No, it is not!
- It is.


1138
01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:55.220
They're on foot.
I've switched to a rented car...


1139
01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:57.180
...a sweet Beemer.

1140
01:22:57.620 --> 01:23:00.580
What do I like
to do best in bed?

1141
01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:02.780
I like to giggle.
- Giggle?


1142
01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:04.180
Cuddle and giggle.

1143
01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:07.660
After a hard day of smacking people,
its nice to cuddle.


1144
01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:09.100
Cuddle?

1145
01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:11.100
You mean, just cuddle?

1146
01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:23.780
<i>The next morning, an island-hopping
food-supply plane left Eden.</i>


1147
01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:26.940
<i>Stashed among the food was
a Mr. Tillington of Guilford.</i>


1148
01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:34.500
<i>A credit-card check found Lisa and Elliot
at a hotel in New Orleans.</i>


1149
01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:38.020
<i>We were on our way,
racking up the frequent-flyer miles.</i>


1150
01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:43.740
Come on, slowpoke, get dressed.

1151
01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:46.860
Its a beautiful day outside,
and were going to have some fun.


1152
01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:49.860
What do you have there? I'm starving.

1153
01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:54.700
Croissants from the French Quarter.

1154
01:23:57.860 --> 01:23:59.620
I don't need butter with my...

1155
01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:07.580
Now, pay attention.
This is an old Australian recipe.


1156
01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:12.740
Thank you.

1157
01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:22.460
One stick of butter...

1158
01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:24.540
...at room temperature.

1159
01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:36.740
Did you see <i>Last Tango in Paris</i>?

1160
01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:38.780
No.

1161
01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:44.060
And a sprinkle...

1162
01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:46.420
...of cinnamon.

1163
01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:56.260
Australian kink.

1164
01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:01.140
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

1165
01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:19.380
Excuse me.

1166
01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:23.140
I'm sorry.

1167
01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:27.500
Yes?

1168
01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:29.340
<i>Mistress Lisa, this is Richard.</i>

1169
01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:32.340
<i>While you were kidnapping a guest,
all hell broke loose here.</i>


1170
01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:35.420
I understand. I got it.
<i>- Did you know what Mrs.--</i>


1171
01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:48.740
Who was that?

1172
01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:50.260
Richard.

1173
01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:52.020
Quite a mood breaker.

1174
01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:53.820
He thinks I kidnapped you.

1175
01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:55.380
He what?

1176
01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:58.460
I broke my own rule,
taking you off the island.


1177
01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:02.900
So are you going back?
- I have to. I'm the boss.


1178
01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:05.460
If I'm the boss, why
do I have to go?

1179
01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:08.260
I always wanted to go see New Orleans.
I'm here right now!


1180
01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:10.380
I don't know what I'm doing.

1181
01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:12.620
And I'm whining.

1182
01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:18.620
Come on.

1183
01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:26.700
Where are we going?
- That's a surprise.


1184
01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:33.660
This is one of our loveliest
antebellum mansions in the area.


1185
01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:35.820
Antebellum means anything...

1186
01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:39.140
...that was before
the War of Northern Aggression.


1187
01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:42.100
Please, come right on in.

1188
01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:46.860
Yall watch your step, now. Be careful.
And yes, you can take photographs in here.


1189
01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:49.860
I always wanted to come here.
- Why?


1190
01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:52.580
My mother was born in New Orleans.

1191
01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:57.620
Speak.
- <i>Latte, I'm here!</i>


1192
01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.100
What took you so long?

1193
01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:04.540
Now, yall can buy your souvenirs from the
souvenir stand over there after the tour.


1194
01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:09.020
This is the famous Beauregard staircase.

1195
01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:13.260
Unfortunately, the second floor isn't
open to us because of renovations...


1196
01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:18.060
...but I'm sure well all be more than
satisfied with the family heirlooms...


1197
01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:20.900
...were fixin' to see downstairs.

1198
01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:24.100
<i>Fred and I arrived in New Orleans...</i>

1199
01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:27.380
<i>...and found a guy in the Big Easy
who really wasn't that easy.</i>


1200
01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:29.380
Why are you busting our chops?

1201
01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:34.300
Ill tell ya. I hate cops an awful lot.
- I'm gonna kill him.


1202
01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:37.500
And it doesn't matter that this is
a life-and-death issue?


1203
01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:38.660
Nope.

1204
01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:42.020
Do you want us
to bribe you with money?

1205
01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:43.140
Nope.

1206
01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:47.420
You want to see me naked?
- Now, that's an idea.


1207
01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:49.740
What do you think, Fred?

1208
01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:54.540
I think that's a US Code violation,
Section 616, Subparagraph 5A.


1209
01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:57.580
What would that be?
- Sexual Harassment of a Peace Officer.


1210
01:27:57.660 --> 01:27:59.580
Exactly what I thought.
- Okay, you win.


1211
01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:03.820
She bought tour tickets:
plantation, mansion, wanted to see Tara.


1212
01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:05.860
Come on, I dare you.

1213
01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:10.540
Yall follow me back to the gardens...

1214
01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:13.340
...where well view
the jasmine-covered gazebo.


1215
01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:16.740
Watch your step, now.
Flagstone is slippery.


1216
01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:23.980
Look.

1217
01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:26.740
Its a beautiful...

1218
01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:28.340
...bedroom.

1219
01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:33.860
I just thought it would be great to...

1220
01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:36.980
...be alone in a traditional
Southern bedroom with...


1221
01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:38.860
No equipment.

1222
01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:40.820
Just us.

1223
01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:42.940
No party tricks.

1224
01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:45.820
You okay with that?

1225
01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:55.340
<i>This lovely garden
and charming tennis court...</i>


1226
01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:57.980
<i>...was the site
of Mr. Beauregard's wedding...</i>


1227
01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:01.500
<i>...to the exquisite Miss Ophelia Prescott.</i>

1228
01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:04.140
<i>One of the most extravagant nuptials
for the period...</i>


1229
01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:07.460
<i>...it epitomized the Romantic Era.</i>

1230
01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:17.580
You okay?

1231
01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:19.420
Yeah, its...

1232
01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:22.140
I feel a little awkward in this position.

1233
01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:42.660
Just relax.

1234
01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:26.940
<i>At 3:45, a tourist spotted a man
fitting Omar's description...</i>


1235
01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:28.700
<i>...outside the Beauregard Mansion.</i>

1236
01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:34.220
<i>He was dressed to kill.</i>

1237
01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:38.180
Every time you want a job done properly,
you have to do it yourself.


1238
01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:44.780
<i>Omar was running out of time,
and he was running out of accents.</i>


1239
01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:47.100
Hi, I wonder if you could help me.

1240
01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:51.420
Hi, I wonder if you could help me.

1241
01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:54.140
Did you see a young couple
come in here a while back?


1242
01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:56.260
Shes very pretty, reddish-brown hair.

1243
01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:58.460
Shes my cousin Annabelle
and her boyfriend.


1244
01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:01.180
Perhaps if you bought a fan.

1245
01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:03.940
Sure, III buy a fan. 
Ill have that one.

1246
01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:06.900
We have to leave this place
exactly how we found it.


1247
01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:08.540
Yeah, sure.

1248
01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:16.100
This should be it.

1249
01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:24.020
Excuse me.

1250
01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:32.100
Mr. Tillington, what are you doing here?

1251
01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:35.980
Actually, I'm here to take
Mr. Slaters camera and all his film.


1252
01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:37.180
Why?

1253
01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:39.980
You were unfortunate enough
to take a rare photograph of me.


1254
01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:43.780
In fact, the only photograph taken of me
since the third grade.


1255
01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:45.580
The guy at the baggage claim!

1256
01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:47.060
The camera.

1257
01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:49.580
Go downstairs, Lisa.
- You sit still.


1258
01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:51.580
The camera.

1259
01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:54.380
There's the tour.
- Yeah.


1260
01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:55.780
The camera!

1261
01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:18.140
Take this side?
- You bet!


1262
01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:19.380
Police!

1263
01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:22.020
Look, they're reenacting something.

1264
01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:24.860
Police! Out of the way!

1265
01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.660
Look, that woman has a gun.

1266
01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:28.700
Is she on our tour?

1267
01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:41.860
Hold it!

1268
01:32:57.700 --> 01:33:00.260
I didn't. I swear, I couldn't.

1269
01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:03.300
Sorry I'm late.
I got hung up on the wisteria.


1270
01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:09.260
Police! You okay?
- Yeah.


1271
01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:11.740
Sheila, duck!

1272
01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:20.980
Reenactment, my ass!

1273
01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:22.620
Partner!

1274
01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:25.220
You look like Eva Marie Saint.

1275
01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:28.260
God, Fred, you're good.

1276
01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:32.780
LAPD! Hi!

1277
01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:36.540
Were tourists here, too!
Were really enjoying Louisiana!


1278
01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:39.060
We love New Orleans! Who dat?

1279
01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:42.860
<i>Omar survived the fall with
two broken legs, two gunshot wounds...</i>


1280
01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:44.660
<i>...and he's now in traction.</i>

1281
01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:49.340
<i>His photograph was
in over 65 newspapers, in color.</i>


1282
01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:54.180
Summers. Who's Summers?

1283
01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:56.780
Home with Mom and Dad like you?
- Get out of there!


1284
01:33:56.860 --> 01:33:59.900
You say he was trying to steal your purse?
- He did take my purse.


1285
01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:03.180
And when you wouldn't give it to him,
he punched you.


1286
01:34:03.260 --> 01:34:06.380
And when I was laying on the floor,
he took my wallet and my keys.


1287
01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:10.100
Did you get a good look at him?
- Of course I did! It was my husband!


1288
01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:11.580
Why are you still with him?

1289
01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:15.260
Everything is in his name: the house,
the car. Where am I supposed to live?


1290
01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:18.260
How will I survive?
- I don't know how you survived this long.


1291
01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:20.020
Its your fourth time this month.

1292
01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:22.980
Stop letting this man control your life.

1293
01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:24.540
You okay, lady?

1294
01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:28.940
But I don't even know if you can tell
its Omar. I was shooting blind.


1295
01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:32.140
Well develop it and let you know.
Thanks for all your help, okay?


1296
01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:34.700
Hes all yours.
- Id like to take that statement.


1297
01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:36.860
Okay.
- Miss Emerson, you all right?


1298
01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:38.820
Yes, I would like to go.
- Sure.


1299
01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:42.740
Ill do my statement. It wont take long.
- I want to go back to the hotel.


1300
01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:47.260
Listen, well just be down the hall.
You can ask for the squad room. All right?


1301
01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:48.820
Come on, Fred.

1302
01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:50.620
Fred, come on.

1303
01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:54.220
Why?
- Come on, Fred!


1304
01:34:55.140 --> 01:34:58.180
You know, you've gotten real bossy
since that damn island.


1305
01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:00.820
You okay?
- Just tired.


1306
01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:04.060
I thought I was going to lose you.

1307
01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:07.700
I love you, Lisa Emerson.

1308
01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:14.460
I really need to get out of this building.
- Okay.


1309
01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:17.500
Ill meet you back at the hotel,
soon as I can.


1310
01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:55.380
Taxi!

1311
01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:09.820
Sheila, hi.

1312
01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:13.780
Bonnie, how are you?
- Great.


1313
01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:16.980
If you see Fred, would you tell him
I'm double-parked outside?


1314
01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:18.380
I sure will.

1315
01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:19.780
Thanks.

1316
01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:20.940
You're welcome.

1317
01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:22.580
See you.

1318
01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:25.500
Nice seeing you...

1319
01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:27.300
...Bonnie.

1320
01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:30.900
Bye, thanks for your help.

1321
01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:33.740
I got that stuff faxed,
so I'm ready to take off.


1322
01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:35.500
Your ex-wife is here.

1323
01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:38.220
Shes outside.
What is she doing in New Orleans?


1324
01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:39.820
I flew her in for the weekend.

1325
01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:43.420
Were actually talking about maybe
taking a shot at putting it back together.


1326
01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:44.700
That's nice.

1327
01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:47.580
See you in the office on Monday.

1328
01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:51.420
Nice job, partner.

1329
01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:53.220
Were both good.

1330
01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:55.340
Thanks.

1331
01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:01.140
Why are we pretending
that your bag isn't buzzing?


1332
01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:03.500
You bought a vibrator!
- Just a razor.


1333
01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:05.500
Fred got a vibrator!
- Just a little...


1334
01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:07.740
I knew it! Yes, you did!
I cant believe you!


1335
01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:09.780
Did you get it on the island?
- Yes.


1336
01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:14.140
They had a discount for employees.
Its for Bonnie.


1337
01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:16.860
See you back in LA, partner.
- All right.


1338
01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:18.860
I'm ovulating.

1339
01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:22.340
An egg was just released
into my Fallopian tube.


1340
01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:25.340
Another one just dropped.
Its in my uterus.


1341
01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:30.860
I love that guy.

1342
01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:39.820
Hello?

1343
01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:41.980
Hello, Mr. Slater.
<i>- Oh, it's you.</i>


1344
01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:43.900
Try to control your excitement.

1345
01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:47.380
You left your broken camera
here at the station.


1346
01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:49.780
You can send it over to me.

1347
01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:53.100
She left?
<i>- How'd you know?</i>


1348
01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:57.060
I can hear it
in your voice. I'm sorry.

1349
01:37:57.140 --> 01:37:59.380
She left a note.
She went back to the island.


1350
01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:01.220
<i>I have to go to the island tomorrow.</i>

1351
01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:06.020
They found your film. If you want to
hop a ride with me, III see what I can do.


1352
01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:11.620
I didn't hear what you said. Did you
say... Could you hold on a second?


1353
01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:15.260
I am on the phone here.

1354
01:38:15.340 --> 01:38:18.940
Sugar, calm down.
You're gonna have yourself a heart attack.


1355
01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:22.260
Sugar, calm down.

1356
01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:23.620
Hello?

1357
01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:27.100
Sugar, he hung up!

1358
01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:47.140
Mistress Lisa!

1359
01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:51.940
There's a visitor here to see you.

1360
01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:57.020
Here's the film.
- Thank you very much.


1361
01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:59.820
Thank you for saving my life.
- Got a minute?


1362
01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:01.140
Sure.

1363
01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:05.340
This is none of my business,
and you can tell me to butt out.


1364
01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:07.300
Elliot told me what happened.

1365
01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:08.660
Butt out.

1366
01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:10.940
You two seemed to have
something special.


1367
01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:12.900
You said I could
tell you to butt out.

1368
01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:15.660
I said you could tell me.
I didn't say that I would do it.


1369
01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:18.100
You think I came all this way
just to get the film?


1370
01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:20.020
Haven't you heard of Federal Express?

1371
01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:21.980
Why did you come?

1372
01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:24.180
I wanted to talk to you about Elliot.

1373
01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:25.940
There's nothing to talk about.

1374
01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:27.900
Lisa, listen to me.

1375
01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:32.500
Lisa, Miss, Madam, Dominatrix...
- Wait, you listen to me.


1376
01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:36.060
You saw those women at the station?

1377
01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:37.340
Sure, I saw.

1378
01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:39.420
You know what they all had in common?

1379
01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:41.100
They all gave up control.

1380
01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:45.900
Come on, you cant run your life from a
couple of poor souls down at a precinct.


1381
01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:49.580
I know a lot of women
involved in healthy relationships.


1382
01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:52.860
You're kind of corny for a cop.

1383
01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:56.220
Listen, I've had my share
of bad times with men, okay?


1384
01:39:56.300 --> 01:39:58.620
Some are assholes, 
Elliot is not.

1385
01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:02.980
If we don't cultivate the good ones,
there aren't gonna be any.


1386
01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:05.740
I'm sorry, I have to go.

1387
01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:10.900
For what its worth, Elliot told me to
tell you there's an old Australian saying:


1388
01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:13.180
It ain't over till the fat kangaroo sings.

1389
01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:20.700
Bye, Mistress Lisa.

1390
01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:28.180
I'm going to take a nap.
I don't want to be disturbed.


1391
01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:31.420
Why are you smiling?
- No reason at all.


1392
01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:50.660
You look...

1393
01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:53.340
I came back to get down on one knee
and propose.


1394
01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:56.260
But it seems overdone,
so I thought Id try it this way.


1395
01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:00.420
Will you marry me?

1396
01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:09.540
You mean, like, leave here,
meet your parents...


1397
01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:11.460
...buy a condo, holidays?

1398
01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:13.540
You want me to cook?

1399
01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:16.780
No, our marriage, love...

1400
01:41:16.980 --> 01:41:19.700
...family, fantasy, erotic,
whatever we decide.


1401
01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:23.620
Can you help me?
Diana tied this a little too tight.


1402
01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:27.460
Babies and bondage, I could do both?
- Yeah.


1403
01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:29.740
Id love to say, 
My wife is a dominatrix.

1404
01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:32.540
I could just see myself at the kids school
on career day.


1405
01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:36.380
I left New Orleans because--
- I don't want to know.


1406
01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:38.740
I'm gonna love you forever.

1407
01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:42.940
Even if I'm scared?
- Even if you're petrified.


1408
01:41:52.140 --> 01:41:53.500
Ill see you on the plane.

1409
01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:57.260
I loved all the citizens: Art, Shawn--
- Thank you so much, really.


1410
01:41:58.020 --> 01:41:59.500
Sheila Kingston. Thank you.

1411
01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:00.740
Sheila.

1412
01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:04.540
I was ready to catch the boat.
I wanted to say good-bye.


1413
01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:06.660
You look really good in clothes.

1414
01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:08.580
What happened to your hand?
- Nothing.


1415
01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:11.100
I didn't recognize you
without your thong and chains.


1416
01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:13.700
Did you get fired?
- No, I don't work here.


1417
01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:17.460
I come here a couple of times a year
just for a little fun and relaxation.


1418
01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:19.780
Sure, I see.

1419
01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:22.780
One of my factories is in Los Angeles...

1420
01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:25.300
...where I hear you're with the police.
- Yes, I am.


1421
01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:30.140
I wonder if maybe
we could have dinner sometime?


1422
01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:33.260
Really?
- Yeah.


1423
01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:37.380
I don't know.
I never really thought about it.


1424
01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:39.100
Take my card.

1425
01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:42.180
You're a CEO.

1426
01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:44.220
Yes, I am.

1427
01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:47.660
<i>This is the final boarding call.</i>
- I have to go catch the plane.


1428
01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:50.100
You look great.
- You look great.


1429
01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:52.580
Bye.
- Ill see you.


1430
01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:11.700
Bye.

1431
01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:13.780
Bye.

1432
01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:19.300
Did you see that?
<i>- C'est I'amour de jeunesse.</i>


1433
01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:21.980
<i>Au revoir. Croissant.</i>

1434
01:43:30.220 --> 01:43:32.860
You know, I have always had this fantasy...

1435
01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:36.820
...about being with a kind man.

1436
01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:39.620
With an incredible <i>derri</i> e <i>re</i>.

1437
01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:42.260
<i>So, I'm a matchmaker.</i>

1438
01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:45.180
<i>Lisa and Elliot are getting married
on July 4.</i>


1439
01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:49.500
<i>To send a present, they're registered
at Tiffany's in the leather department.</i>


1440
01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:51.780
<i>Nina Blackstone is serving time in prison.</i>

1441
01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:54.660
<i>I hear she calls the bingo game
every Friday night:</i>


1442
01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:56.060
<i>"B-14."</i>

1443
01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:57.860
<i>"N-21."</i>

1444
01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:02.020
<i>Omar got three life sentences,
and with our parole system...</i>


1445
01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:04.660
<i>...will probably be out in three months.</i>

1446
01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:07.100
<i>I'm on my second date
with CEO Tommy Miller.</i>


1447
01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:09.380
<i>He helped my fantasies
come true last Saturday...</i>


1448
01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:12.500
<i>...by sending over four men
who painted my house.</i>


1449
01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:15.180
<i>What did I learn from this case?</i>

1450
01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:19.580
<i>No matter what your sexual preference,
true love is still the ultimate fantasy.</i>


1451
01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:56.060
<i>l-14.</i>

<i>Listen, all of you people out there...</i>

1455
01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:07.820
<i>...don't kill anyone.</i>

1456

<i>Prison stinks.</i>
