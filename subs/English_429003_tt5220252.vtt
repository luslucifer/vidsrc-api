00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.595
<i>Good Day.</i>

3
00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.830
<i>Baranka den laman.</i>

4
00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.833
<i>The rock in the sea,</i>

5
00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:37.171
<i>pounded by the waves
on its North Shore</i>


6
00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:39.006
<i>yet unassuming and tranquil</i>

7
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.175
<i>on its southern beaches.</i>

8
00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:43.110
<i>Bon Bini.</i>

9
00:00:43.144 --> 00:00:45.545
<i>Welcome to the living paradox</i>

10
00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.214
<i>that is Curaçao.</i>

11
00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:18.978
Stay with me.

12
00:01:19.013 --> 00:01:20.814
Thank you.

13
00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:22.316
Uh-huh!

14
00:01:27.088 --> 00:01:30.091
<i>When you ask a Curacaoan
how he's doing,</i>


15
00:01:30.124 --> 00:01:33.494
<i>he'll probably answer,
"Oh, mas o menos,"</i>


16
00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:36.729
<i>"more or less,"
which really means,</i>


17
00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:39.766
<i>"it's between the devil
and the deep blue sea."</i>


18
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.575
<i>A colorful mix of ethnicities,
races, and religions,</i>


19
00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.110
<i>proud to be a melting pot,</i>

20
00:01:49.143 --> 00:01:51.011
<i>able to get along
with each other.</i>


21
00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:52.179
<i>Some not.</i>

22
00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:58.085
<i>The Kurasoleño is equal parts</i>

23
00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.354
<i>Latin temperament,</i>

24
00:02:00.387 --> 00:02:02.022
<i>African rhythm,</i>

25
00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:06.594
<i>and European
entrepreneurial spirit.</i>


26
00:02:48.035 --> 00:02:50.304
Bring me
to the San Marco Hotel.


27
00:03:00.648 --> 00:03:02.616
Hey.

28
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.519
Want to make a stop
at Campo Alegre, shon?


29
00:03:05.553 --> 00:03:08.122
A bunch of Colombians
came in yesterday,


30
00:03:08.155 --> 00:03:11.025
and boy, they're looking good.

31
00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:21.368
<i>Poverty is disguised
with poetic labels.</i>


32
00:03:21.402 --> 00:03:24.205
<i>Seru Fortuna.</i>

33
00:03:24.238 --> 00:03:25.972
<i>Buena Vista.</i>

34
00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:27.608
<i>Fleur de Marie.</i>

35
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:30.010
<i>Beautiful names
for the ugly result</i>


36
00:03:30.044 --> 00:03:32.879
<i>of hundreds of years
of colonial rule.</i>


37
00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:36.849
<i>Kurasoleños live life
the best way they can.</i>


38
00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.485
<i>The motto being:</i>

39
00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.322
"If you must starve,
at least wear a silk shirt."


40
00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:24.198
The San Marco Hotel.

41
00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:26.267
You sure you want
to stay here?


42
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.269
A gentleman of your stature
stays more at the, uh,


43
00:04:28.302 --> 00:04:30.770
the Hyatt or the Renaissance?

44
00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:33.840
I am sorry.
I don't have guilders.


45
00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:38.545
I would like for you to
drive me around the island.


46
00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:41.948
If you're on time
and you don't ask questions,


47
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:43.850
I might consider
hiring you for the week.


48
00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:45.019
Ah.

49
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.590
Oh, sure, anytime, anytime.

50
00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:51.191
I got some places to show you.

51
00:04:51.225 --> 00:04:53.427
Uh, have you had
criollo food?


52
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.794
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?


53
00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:56.497
- 8:00 a.m.
- 8:00 a.m.


54
00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:04.871
Mm.

55
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.673
<i>Almost 40 years
have passed,</i>


56
00:05:39.707 --> 00:05:42.909
<i>and it seems like
nothing has changed.</i>


57
00:05:42.942 --> 00:05:44.445
<i>But then again,</i>

58
00:05:44.478 --> 00:05:46.647
<i>nothing ever really changes,</i>

59
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.880
<i>does it?</i>

60
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.119
<i>I was just 11 years old.</i>

61
00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:20.447
<i>My father, Bubu Fiel,</i>

62
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:22.483
<i>was my hero.</i>

63
00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:25.652
<i>He did anything
and everything he wanted,</i>


64
00:06:25.686 --> 00:06:28.288
<i>whenever he wanted.</i>

65
00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:33.893
Mm.

66
00:06:43.704 --> 00:06:46.206
<i>My mother, Nora Fiel,</i>

67
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.575
<i>did not always agree with that.</i>

68
00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:52.346
Where were you?

69
00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:55.215
Where were you?

70
00:06:58.886 --> 00:07:00.821
You stink!

71
00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:03.891
You smell like the cheap perfume
of a whore.


72
00:07:05.192 --> 00:07:06.994
And you're drunk!

73
00:07:07.027 --> 00:07:08.928
Where's the money?

74
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:10.831
Where's the mon...

75
00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:12.900
Did you leave it in her pussy?

76
00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:15.002
I can't believe you!

77
00:07:17.304 --> 00:07:20.641
Why does my husband
love whores so much?


78
00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:23.010
Where is it?

79
00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:24.445
Hey, Nora, come on!

80
00:07:24.478 --> 00:07:26.046
Easy with the car!
Come on.


81
00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:28.248
- Where did the money go?
- Huh?


82
00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:32.853
Did you make any money?

83
00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:36.190
I... I waited all night
for this... this...


84
00:07:36.223 --> 00:07:38.792
this Holland plane;
it never arrived, Nora.


85
00:07:38.826 --> 00:07:40.260
Never arrived.

86
00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:43.363
There are no Holland planes
on Saturday!


87
00:07:43.397 --> 00:07:45.899
You fucked a whore at Campo!

88
00:07:45.933 --> 00:07:48.702
You gave her all your money,
didn't you?


89
00:07:48.735 --> 00:07:50.737
Didn't you?

90
00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:54.208
We need money
for Ostrik's shoes!


91
00:08:05.052 --> 00:08:08.055
<i>Just up the road
was Manchi's Hill,</i>


92
00:08:08.088 --> 00:08:12.059
<i>named after Manchi Sanantonio
from Willemstad.</i>


93
00:08:12.092 --> 00:08:16.063
<i>He had built an enormous
eight-bedroom house there.</i>


94
00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:19.066
<i>Some people said</i>

95
00:08:19.099 --> 00:08:22.669
<i>he had spread himself
all over the hill.</i>


96
00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.273
It's not for you
to understand!


97
00:08:26.306 --> 00:08:28.108
Just do as I say.

98
00:08:28.141 --> 00:08:29.843
- Manchi, I'm just leaving...
- Whore!


99
00:08:29.877 --> 00:08:32.346
I will not discuss
this with you!


100
00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:33.614
When I tell you
bring me your shoes,


101
00:08:33.647 --> 00:08:34.748
you will bring me your shoes!

102
00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:36.016
You are crazy!

103
00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:37.184
What do you want with them?

104
00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:39.520
It's none of your business!

105
00:08:39.553 --> 00:08:41.255
Bring me your shoes.

106
00:08:41.288 --> 00:08:42.756
All of them.

107
00:08:45.592 --> 00:08:50.531
<i>Solema was the wife
of Manchi Sanantonio.</i>


108
00:08:50.564 --> 00:08:53.600
<i>Educated, proud,</i>

109
00:08:53.634 --> 00:08:55.369
<i>and collected.</i>

110
00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:13.787
You women are useless!

111
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.289
Ostrik.

112
00:09:15.322 --> 00:09:17.124
Right on time.

113
00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:19.027
Are you ready for church?

114
00:09:31.438 --> 00:09:32.906
Bye!

115
00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:41.748
Ostrik,
instead of turning pages,


116
00:09:41.782 --> 00:09:43.750
I've decided to let you
play today.


117
00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:47.187
This is what you have to play.

118
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.655
Dushi.

119
00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:52.926
Okay, off you go now.

120
00:10:05.906 --> 00:10:07.708
<i>Before I knew it,</i>

121
00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:10.777
<i>I was an accomplice
to infidelity.</i>


122
00:10:16.084 --> 00:10:17.951
The terrible thing
about men is not so much


123
00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:20.687
that they deceive us,
but they come to us


124
00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:22.689
with childish lies afterwards.

125
00:10:22.723 --> 00:10:24.191
And they don't just
cheat on you.


126
00:10:24.224 --> 00:10:25.926
They try to
drive you crazy, too.


127
00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:27.861
Then they even run off
with another woman.


128
00:10:27.894 --> 00:10:29.529
- Mm-hmm.
- Like Bubu did,


129
00:10:29.563 --> 00:10:31.932
when he ran off
with that whore to Aruba


130
00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.300
for a whole year.

131
00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:34.534
It's shameful.

132
00:10:34.568 --> 00:10:36.970
- It's shameful.
- It's humiliating.


133
00:10:37.005 --> 00:10:38.472
That airplane landed last night,
all right.


134
00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:39.873
Yeah.

135
00:10:39.906 --> 00:10:41.708
Right into that
Campo whore's crotch.


136
00:10:43.077 --> 00:10:44.878
Excuse me, please.

137
00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:47.115
Come here.
Quick.


138
00:10:48.849 --> 00:10:50.317
Go ahead.

139
00:11:00.427 --> 00:11:02.396
Is Chamon there?

140
00:11:02.429 --> 00:11:04.665
I am looking for Chamon.

141
00:11:04.698 --> 00:11:07.001
<i>Chamon?
He's not here.</i>


142
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.865
Are you married, shon?

143
00:11:40.233 --> 00:11:41.368
I am.

144
00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:43.171
For more than 40 years.

145
00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:45.505
Here.

146
00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:46.540
This is the wife,

147
00:11:46.573 --> 00:11:47.607
and there's the children,

148
00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:49.710
and the grandchildren.

149
00:11:49.743 --> 00:11:52.180
What good is a man
without his family, eh?


150
00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:56.817
You're not much
of a talker, are you?


151
00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.553
Well, that's okay,
because I am.


152
00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:01.488
My name is Coco.

153
00:12:01.521 --> 00:12:04.558
That's short for Jacobo.

154
00:12:08.162 --> 00:12:10.731
This whole island
has gone down the drain.


155
00:12:10.764 --> 00:12:12.899
The makamba,
they come here, you know,


156
00:12:12.933 --> 00:12:16.903
with their guilders
and their euros,


157
00:12:16.937 --> 00:12:20.574
while the people of Curaçao
work hard to make ends meet.


158
00:12:26.013 --> 00:12:27.914
Oh, wait, wait a minute.
Hold it.


159
00:12:31.952 --> 00:12:33.653
I don't mean you.

160
00:12:33.687 --> 00:12:34.888
You're not a makamba.

161
00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:36.389
You're not even Dutch.

162
00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:38.226
In fact...

163
00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:41.129
you look more like
Kurasoleño to me.


164
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:44.397
Are you one of us?

165
00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:45.632
Eh?

166
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.151
A very famous taxi driver
lived here once.


167
00:13:37.185 --> 00:13:38.552
A legend.

168
00:14:05.545 --> 00:14:07.747
<i>Every Sunday afternoon,</i>

169
00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:11.518
<i>my father played dominoes
with his friends.</i>


170
00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:18.925
<i>The way they played dominoes
was a reflection</i>


171
00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:21.928
<i>of the way
they lived their lives.</i>


172
00:14:23.563 --> 00:14:26.433
<i>Chamon was a cautious man.</i>

173
00:14:26.466 --> 00:14:28.368
<i>Being a foreigner,</i>

174
00:14:28.401 --> 00:14:30.704
<i>that wasn't a bad idea.</i>

175
00:14:33.974 --> 00:14:37.444
<i>Manchi considered the game
to be beneath him.</i>


176
00:14:37.477 --> 00:14:40.181
<i>He wished he could
play bridge.</i>


177
00:14:40.214 --> 00:14:42.183
<i>Like the makambas.</i>

178
00:14:44.218 --> 00:14:46.553
<i>Ernesto was the strategist,</i>

179
00:14:46.586 --> 00:14:48.189
<i>smarter than the others</i>

180
00:14:48.222 --> 00:14:50.590
<i>and always one step
ahead of them.</i>


181
00:14:51.491 --> 00:14:54.128
<i>My father played for fun,</i>

182
00:14:54.161 --> 00:14:57.631
<i>because it was the only game
he knew well enough to win.</i>


183
00:14:57.664 --> 00:14:59.000
Game!

184
00:14:59.033 --> 00:15:00.500
Ostrik.

185
00:15:00.533 --> 00:15:01.835
Papa is king.

186
00:15:01.868 --> 00:15:04.372
- Dad, Dad, Dad!
- Papa is king!


187
00:15:05.772 --> 00:15:07.074
Nora!

188
00:15:07.108 --> 00:15:09.310
Can we get some drinks?

189
00:15:09.343 --> 00:15:12.846
<i>My mother, Nora,
had worked hard her whole life,</i>


190
00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:15.149
<i>and still she looked great.</i>

191
00:15:15.182 --> 00:15:18.352
<i>She was determined
that one day,</i>


192
00:15:18.386 --> 00:15:20.487
<i>I would become a doctor.</i>

193
00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:32.966
Hm.

194
00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:41.608
What the last word?

195
00:15:41.641 --> 00:15:42.909
Emancipation!

196
00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:45.779
- No.
- Yes, emancipation.


197
00:15:45.812 --> 00:15:47.981
No!

198
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:51.451
What is the first letter?

199
00:15:51.484 --> 00:15:53.853
- E!
- Emancipation!


200
00:15:53.887 --> 00:15:57.291
- Nope.
- Okay, what is it?


201
00:15:57.325 --> 00:16:00.460
Uh, E...

202
00:16:00.493 --> 00:16:02.129
boogedy boop!

203
00:16:02.163 --> 00:16:03.697
<i>Vera, my sister...</i>

204
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.399
<i>Was by far my favorite.</i>

205
00:16:05.433 --> 00:16:07.467
<i>She could always
make me laugh.</i>


206
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.070
<i>As for me?</i>

207
00:16:09.103 --> 00:16:11.105
<i>I was convinced
there was more to life</i>


208
00:16:11.138 --> 00:16:13.207
<i>than playing dominoes.</i>

209
00:16:46.539 --> 00:16:48.142
Hello, Vera.

210
00:16:48.175 --> 00:16:50.510
You didn't say you were coming.

211
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.933
Hello, Mama.

212
00:17:17.371 --> 00:17:18.838
Mama...

213
00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:24.178
It's Ostrik, your son.

214
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.250
It's Ostrik.

215
00:17:34.854 --> 00:17:38.125
Did you bring your Holland plane
with you?


216
00:17:39.659 --> 00:17:43.596
I really miss
that big Holland plane.


217
00:17:48.935 --> 00:17:52.306
She has a habit of
wandering off by herself, but...


218
00:17:53.673 --> 00:17:55.443
at least she's healthy.

219
00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.052
I have to go.

220
00:18:05.086 --> 00:18:06.987
I have another appointment,

221
00:18:07.021 --> 00:18:09.223
but I will be back soon enough.

222
00:18:12.692 --> 00:18:15.262
How long will you be staying
this time?


223
00:18:32.413 --> 00:18:36.450
No, no, you cannot attend class
without shoes, Ostrik.


224
00:18:36.484 --> 00:18:38.785
But he has exams
in two weeks.


225
00:18:39.652 --> 00:18:41.654
No shoes, no exams.

226
00:18:42.889 --> 00:18:45.792
No graduation.
Is that clear?


227
00:18:45.825 --> 00:18:49.296
You've got more brains than all
the other kids in the class.


228
00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.731
His brains are not
in his feet.


229
00:18:51.764 --> 00:18:53.300
It is a rule, ma'am.

230
00:18:53.334 --> 00:18:54.634
End of discussion.

231
00:18:54.667 --> 00:18:57.204
No shoes, no exam.

232
00:18:58.072 --> 00:18:59.340
Sorry.

233
00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:05.045
Who can tell me the answer
to the nearest decimal?


234
00:19:05.079 --> 00:19:07.947
Just as an economic system,
socialism...


235
00:19:14.121 --> 00:19:16.390
So production, distribution,

236
00:19:16.423 --> 00:19:19.393
and exchange all be owned
and regulated


237
00:19:19.426 --> 00:19:21.629
by the community as a whole.

238
00:19:43.617 --> 00:19:45.419
They threw Ostrik
out of school!


239
00:19:45.452 --> 00:19:46.420
Ow!

240
00:19:46.453 --> 00:19:47.754
Come.

241
00:19:49.223 --> 00:19:50.690
Nora.

242
00:19:52.792 --> 00:19:54.161
Nora.

243
00:20:07.007 --> 00:20:09.109
Hey, Ostrik.

244
00:20:11.412 --> 00:20:14.048
You know,
I was always glad


245
00:20:14.081 --> 00:20:15.848
when I could skip class.

246
00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:17.551
Hmm?

247
00:20:17.585 --> 00:20:20.887
They won't let Ostrik
into school without shoes.


248
00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.789
How do you expect your son
to become a doctor


249
00:20:22.822 --> 00:20:25.526
when you fritter away the money
chasing whores?


250
00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:27.294
Hey, come on.

251
00:20:30.097 --> 00:20:33.534
Come on, eh?
Shut your trap.


252
00:20:33.567 --> 00:20:37.204
You're getting too old for
this kind of foolishness, Bubu.


253
00:20:37.238 --> 00:20:39.006
And when are you
going to get serious


254
00:20:39.039 --> 00:20:40.374
about building the house?

255
00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:42.243
Leave me alone, woman!

256
00:20:42.276 --> 00:20:44.144
- Come on.
- Leave you alone?


257
00:20:44.178 --> 00:20:46.647
If you don't start
building seriously,


258
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.382
you'll be behind
all your friends.


259
00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:50.850
And you promised me you'd
plant me a tamarind tree.


260
00:20:50.883 --> 00:20:52.586
I see no tamarind growing here.

261
00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.388
I... you see?

262
00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:56.956
I swear by Jose...

263
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.340
Ready, Ostrik?
Number one, number one.


264
00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:18.545
Wah-hoo!

265
00:21:20.281 --> 00:21:21.781
Three, two, one.

266
00:21:21.814 --> 00:21:22.949
Hang on!

267
00:21:31.125 --> 00:21:32.426
Whoo!
Last one.

00:24:58.432 --> 00:25:00.167
Chamon Nicolas
hasn't got a wife,


325
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.802
and he's better off
than you are.


326
00:25:01.835 --> 00:25:03.370
He's got houses.

327
00:25:05.105 --> 00:25:06.640
Houses?

328
00:25:06.673 --> 00:25:08.609
How did you know
he has houses?


329
00:25:08.642 --> 00:25:10.177
I don't know,
people say.


330
00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.746
No, you... you... you sounded sure.

331
00:25:12.779 --> 00:25:14.948
Did he... did he
tell you something?


332
00:25:14.982 --> 00:25:18.418
- What are you implying, Bubu?
- Not implying.


333
00:25:18.452 --> 00:25:21.255
You left me for a whole year

334
00:25:21.288 --> 00:25:25.626
to be with that whore
from Aruba,


335
00:25:25.659 --> 00:25:28.362
and you now are accusing me
of something?


336
00:25:28.395 --> 00:25:30.030
Is that what you're doing?

337
00:25:30.063 --> 00:25:31.331
No.

338
00:25:32.065 --> 00:25:34.101
I didn't think so.

339
00:25:39.673 --> 00:25:41.775
<i>25 years before,</i>

340
00:25:41.808 --> 00:25:44.945
<i>Chamon Nicolas came
to Curaçao from Saba</i>


341
00:25:44.978 --> 00:25:47.848
<i>and got a job
with the oil company.</i>


342
00:25:47.881 --> 00:25:51.151
<i>He was fired for stealing
building supplies.</i>


343
00:25:51.184 --> 00:25:54.054
<i>But with those supplies,
he built a house</i>


344
00:25:54.087 --> 00:25:57.624
<i>in the slum district of
Valentijn and rented it out.</i>


345
00:25:57.658 --> 00:25:59.860
<i>Then, he built a second house</i>

346
00:25:59.893 --> 00:26:02.529
<i>and became
a small-scale capitalist.</i>


347
00:26:03.931 --> 00:26:05.499
You again?

348
00:26:05.532 --> 00:26:07.668
- We already paid you.
- That was two months ago.


349
00:26:07.701 --> 00:26:09.570
It's three, you owe me four.

350
00:26:09.603 --> 00:26:11.371
Why don't you just fuck off,
man?


351
00:26:11.405 --> 00:26:13.173
You have to pay your rent
like everybody else.


352
00:26:13.206 --> 00:26:14.975
There's no exceptions here.

353
00:26:15.009 --> 00:26:17.811
I'm gonna tell you once more,
you dirty foreigner:


354
00:26:17.844 --> 00:26:19.479
go crawl back into
your mother's pussy.


355
00:26:19.513 --> 00:26:21.882
This house is my house.

356
00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:24.885
Move it.

357
00:26:25.686 --> 00:26:27.120
Hey, hey, hey.

358
00:26:27.721 --> 00:26:32.159
Always working our asses off
and getting shit pay,


359
00:26:32.192 --> 00:26:34.861
only so you foreigners
can come along to clean us out.


360
00:26:34.895 --> 00:26:36.563
Fucking...

361
00:26:45.138 --> 00:26:46.740
Hey, watch it!

362
00:26:48.442 --> 00:26:49.643
What happened?

363
00:27:02.056 --> 00:27:03.290
Shit.

364
00:27:10.631 --> 00:27:12.100
Here.

365
00:27:12.132 --> 00:27:14.401
You don't have to be killed
just like that.


366
00:27:14.434 --> 00:27:16.503
I don't care who you are.

367
00:27:19.673 --> 00:27:21.109
Puta!

368
00:27:21.141 --> 00:27:23.243
I'm sending you back
to your mama's womb


369
00:27:23.276 --> 00:27:25.379
right through her cunt.

370
00:27:37.557 --> 00:27:40.494
<i>So this
small-scale capitalist</i>


371
00:27:40.527 --> 00:27:42.829
<i>still preferred
to present himself</i>


372
00:27:42.863 --> 00:27:45.565
<i>as very poor,
because he thought</i>


373
00:27:45.599 --> 00:27:47.401
<i>it was most cautious.</i>

374
00:27:47.934 --> 00:27:49.336
<i>However...</i>

375
00:28:05.952 --> 00:28:08.355
All right, all right.

376
00:28:20.168 --> 00:28:23.637
- Oh, Mrs. Fiel.
- Nora, please.


377
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.205
Nora.

378
00:28:25.238 --> 00:28:27.175
Okay, Nora.

379
00:28:27.974 --> 00:28:30.144
There's something
I can do for you?


380
00:28:30.178 --> 00:28:31.778
Well, um...

381
00:28:31.812 --> 00:28:34.381
I don't know how
to ask you this.


382
00:28:34.414 --> 00:28:36.050
Oh.

383
00:28:36.084 --> 00:28:37.718
Is everything okay?

384
00:28:37.751 --> 00:28:40.954
Well... I need your help.

385
00:28:40.988 --> 00:28:42.255
Okay.

386
00:28:43.191 --> 00:28:44.424
What is it?

387
00:28:45.358 --> 00:28:46.493
First, you must promise me

388
00:28:46.526 --> 00:28:49.463
that Bubu will never find out.

389
00:28:51.431 --> 00:28:52.766
Okay.

390
00:28:54.202 --> 00:28:55.902
Okay, I promise you.

391
00:28:58.338 --> 00:29:01.374
- I need 15 guilders.
- 15 guilders?


392
00:29:01.408 --> 00:29:02.743
You...

393
00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.683
Maybe I could come inside.

394
00:29:09.716 --> 00:29:11.551
We can discuss it.

395
00:29:16.224 --> 00:29:17.457
Come in.

396
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:46.887
Got to go.

397
00:30:10.144 --> 00:30:11.511
Here you go.

398
00:30:26.326 --> 00:30:28.495
- Mmmm, mmm, mmm.
- A real meal.


399
00:30:51.618 --> 00:30:53.120
Morning, Ostrik.

400
00:30:57.191 --> 00:30:58.425
Are you ready?

401
00:32:12.966 --> 00:32:14.768
I have a question.

402
00:32:14.801 --> 00:32:16.237
Ask.

403
00:32:17.305 --> 00:32:18.505
It's more like
a dilemma.


404
00:32:18.538 --> 00:32:20.074
You want an opinion?

405
00:32:20.107 --> 00:32:22.410
Or a decision.

406
00:32:22.442 --> 00:32:24.178
Or a verdict.

407
00:32:24.211 --> 00:32:25.346
Okay.

408
00:32:28.049 --> 00:32:30.784
Say you catch a man
sleeping with your wife.


409
00:32:30.817 --> 00:32:32.420
Who do you shoot?

410
00:32:32.452 --> 00:32:34.788
The man or your wife?

411
00:32:34.821 --> 00:32:37.024
It depends who's on top.

412
00:32:37.058 --> 00:32:39.026
I don't know.
Who you shoot?


413
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.429
Neither, because if you shoot
someone, you're a criminal.


414
00:32:41.461 --> 00:32:44.664
But you shoot nobody,
you is a pussy.


415
00:32:46.499 --> 00:32:48.635
This a story
about a white judge


416
00:32:48.668 --> 00:32:50.404
and his wife,
who is also white.


417
00:32:50.438 --> 00:32:51.538
Hm.

418
00:32:52.472 --> 00:32:53.974
You here, Ernesto,

419
00:32:54.008 --> 00:32:56.476
you be the judge's wife.

420
00:32:58.279 --> 00:33:00.381
Just for the sake
of the argument, hmm?


421
00:33:00.414 --> 00:33:02.216
Let someone else be the woman...

422
00:33:02.249 --> 00:33:05.086
- You, Bubu Fiel.
- Hmm?


423
00:33:05.119 --> 00:33:06.920
You are the man my wife
is carrying on with.


424
00:33:06.953 --> 00:33:09.889
Mm. Good.
Your wife.


425
00:33:09.923 --> 00:33:12.393
That is, if you don't mind me
being the judge for a moment.


426
00:33:12.426 --> 00:33:15.662
You always wanted
to be a judge, Manchi.


427
00:33:15.695 --> 00:33:17.664
Chamon,
can you be the woman?


428
00:33:17.697 --> 00:33:20.500
Okay, just get
to the point.


429
00:33:20.533 --> 00:33:23.404
Now, don't forget,
the other man is a lawyer.


430
00:33:23.437 --> 00:33:25.239
The incident takes place
on the beach.


431
00:33:25.272 --> 00:33:26.606
Beach here?

432
00:33:26.639 --> 00:33:28.175
Maybe here,
maybe some other...


433
00:33:28.209 --> 00:33:29.809
Who cares?

434
00:33:29.843 --> 00:33:33.280
Some time ago, I mean,

435
00:33:33.314 --> 00:33:35.016
one evening,
the wife of the judge


436
00:33:35.049 --> 00:33:36.816
<i>goes down to the beach
to meet the lawyer.</i>


437
00:33:48.895 --> 00:33:53.533
<i>I find you, Bubu Fiel,
in flagrante delicto,</i>


438
00:33:53.566 --> 00:33:55.169
lying on top of my wife!

439
00:33:56.703 --> 00:33:59.706
In "flagrante delicto,"
for those of you


440
00:33:59.739 --> 00:34:03.543
who don't speak Latin,
means "red-handed."


441
00:34:03.576 --> 00:34:05.612
Ooh, but hurry up now.

442
00:34:05.645 --> 00:34:07.515
Otherwise I will come
before you finish.


443
00:34:10.484 --> 00:34:12.153
Yeah, Bubu,
you may be a strong man,


444
00:34:12.186 --> 00:34:13.720
but you can't
do a thing to me.


445
00:34:13.753 --> 00:34:16.956
Of course not, because
he's there on top of your wife.


446
00:34:16.991 --> 00:34:19.559
Yes, I am too busy
fucking her.


447
00:34:22.263 --> 00:34:25.732
You can't, because I have
a revolver aimed at you.


448
00:34:33.074 --> 00:34:35.975
So, the lawyer asked the judge,

449
00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:37.378
<i>"Can I get dressed?"</i>

450
00:34:37.411 --> 00:34:39.146
<i>And the judge answers,</i>

451
00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:41.348
<i>"You did not ask my permission
to get undressed,</i>


452
00:34:41.382 --> 00:34:42.682
<i>did you?"</i>

453
00:34:42.715 --> 00:34:44.717
The point is,
as a judge,


454
00:34:44.751 --> 00:34:47.988
I know how to use the law
to my advantage.


455
00:34:48.022 --> 00:34:50.491
So, do I shoot
this young man?


456
00:34:50.524 --> 00:34:51.992
No.

457
00:34:52.026 --> 00:34:54.095
Because if I shoot him,
I go to jail for murder.


458
00:34:54.128 --> 00:34:56.230
And why should I do that?

459
00:34:56.263 --> 00:34:58.765
I am the innocent party.

460
00:34:59.699 --> 00:35:01.768
So the judge says,

461
00:35:01.801 --> 00:35:04.505
<i>"Do you understand
the law of property?"</i>


462
00:35:04.538 --> 00:35:06.706
<i>The young lawyer doesn't
know how to answer.</i>


463
00:35:06.739 --> 00:35:08.242
<i>The judge says,</i>

464
00:35:08.275 --> 00:35:10.777
<i>"You are using my property.</i>

465
00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:13.447
<i>"You must pay me compensation."</i>

466
00:35:13.481 --> 00:35:15.782
Or in a more common word,
"rent."


467
00:35:15.815 --> 00:35:19.520
So if all this husband
wants is money...


468
00:35:19.553 --> 00:35:21.721
Give him the money.

469
00:35:21.754 --> 00:35:25.126
Yes, Bubu,
that's how clever the judge is.


470
00:35:25.159 --> 00:35:28.295
He now has established
that money is to be paid.


471
00:35:28.329 --> 00:35:30.464
And by relentless logic,

472
00:35:30.498 --> 00:35:32.866
the woman is a whore.

473
00:35:32.899 --> 00:35:35.402
<i>After a desperate search
through his trousers,</i>


474
00:35:35.436 --> 00:35:38.771
<i>he finds five guilders.</i>

475
00:35:38.805 --> 00:35:41.542
Five guil...
it's not enough.


476
00:35:41.575 --> 00:35:44.878
No, you cannot fuck a monkey
with hemorrhoids


477
00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:45.945
for five guilders.

478
00:35:45.979 --> 00:35:47.481
Exactly.

479
00:35:47.515 --> 00:35:49.283
That's the point.

480
00:35:49.316 --> 00:35:52.553
He will pay the price
for the filthiest whore.


481
00:35:52.586 --> 00:35:55.389
A high class whore is,
uh, what, 60?


482
00:35:55.422 --> 00:35:57.057
Man, I wish I could afford that.

483
00:35:57.091 --> 00:35:59.059
Eh, some will do it
for nothing.


484
00:35:59.093 --> 00:36:01.295
No, some will do it
for a lift to Campo.


485
00:36:01.328 --> 00:36:02.997
- Who?
- Some.


486
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.566
And so the judge

487
00:36:05.599 --> 00:36:08.169
<i>makes the lawyer pay his wife.</i>

488
00:36:09.869 --> 00:36:12.072
<i>And he makes his wife pay him.</i>

489
00:36:12.106 --> 00:36:14.608
<i>Five guilders.</i>

490
00:36:14.642 --> 00:36:17.344
<i>Takes the note,
puts it inside his wallet,</i>


491
00:36:17.378 --> 00:36:19.979
right behind a picture
of that slut.


492
00:36:21.215 --> 00:36:25.186
And so,
to teach her a lesson,


493
00:36:25.219 --> 00:36:27.254
he makes her pay him
five guilders


494
00:36:27.288 --> 00:36:30.991
every Sunday before
they sit down to eat.


495
00:36:31.025 --> 00:36:32.593
Eternal punishment.

496
00:36:32.626 --> 00:36:34.861
A woman like that
will commit suicide


497
00:36:34.894 --> 00:36:35.962
unless she leaves that man.

498
00:36:35.996 --> 00:36:37.931
She won't leave him.

499
00:36:37.964 --> 00:36:39.699
She's too frightened of scandal.

500
00:36:41.968 --> 00:36:44.704
All kinds of things happen
in those high circles,


501
00:36:44.737 --> 00:36:47.341
but nothing can ever leak out.

502
00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:54.315
The wife of the judge,
she's a cultivated woman.


503
00:36:54.348 --> 00:36:57.418
You know, someone
of Solema's caliber.


504
00:36:58.652 --> 00:37:00.787
Is that the end of the story?

505
00:37:02.223 --> 00:37:04.258
Can we play dominoes now?

506
00:37:05.725 --> 00:37:08.895
Okay, so it's three to two,
to one to zero.


507
00:37:08.928 --> 00:37:10.297
Mm-mm.

508
00:37:10.331 --> 00:37:11.565
No, no, no, no, no,
it isn't, no.


509
00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:12.700
- Yes, it is.
- No.


510
00:37:12.732 --> 00:37:14.235
You have zero.

511
00:37:14.268 --> 00:37:16.403
Chamon and Ernesto have one,

512
00:37:16.437 --> 00:37:17.870
and I have three.

513
00:37:17.904 --> 00:37:20.140
No, I just say I have two.

514
00:37:20.174 --> 00:37:21.741
Bubu, tell him now.

515
00:37:21.774 --> 00:37:24.478
I... I... I... don't know.

516
00:37:24.511 --> 00:37:26.746
We have to find a better way
to keep score.


517
00:37:26.779 --> 00:37:28.415
Where is Nora?

518
00:38:03.417 --> 00:38:06.086
How long has
she been like that?


519
00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.722
It started
about seven years ago.


520
00:38:08.756 --> 00:38:12.059
Forgetting names, words,

521
00:38:12.092 --> 00:38:14.028
mixing up stuff.

522
00:38:15.396 --> 00:38:18.132
Then three years ago,
it went downhill fast.


523
00:38:19.333 --> 00:38:21.201
It always happens like that.

524
00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:25.039
But with the money I sent you,

525
00:38:25.072 --> 00:38:27.174
why didn't you get
the proper treatment?


526
00:38:31.111 --> 00:38:33.047
Typical Ostrik.

527
00:38:44.758 --> 00:38:47.494
Ah, who likes soup?

528
00:38:47.528 --> 00:38:50.164
So why did you come
back here now, Ostrik?


529
00:38:52.865 --> 00:38:54.501
Liza left me.

530
00:38:56.603 --> 00:38:59.506
- I'm sorry.
- After 20 years...


531
00:39:01.208 --> 00:39:04.944
she said she had
had enough of my schedule.


532
00:39:04.977 --> 00:39:07.481
She also said...

533
00:39:07.514 --> 00:39:10.284
she couldn't bear my
"inability to show emotion"


534
00:39:10.317 --> 00:39:14.488
<i>and</i> she considered me
a control freak.


535
00:39:15.823 --> 00:39:17.691
That coming
from a Dutch woman.


536
00:39:20.893 --> 00:39:23.831
I think she resented the fact
I didn't want children.


537
00:39:23.863 --> 00:39:25.199
I needed to get away.

538
00:39:25.232 --> 00:39:27.000
So I came down here.

539
00:39:32.373 --> 00:39:34.541
Do you check her cholesterol
regularly?


540
00:39:37.211 --> 00:39:39.213
Yes, Ostrik.

541
00:39:39.246 --> 00:39:40.381
Good.

542
00:39:41.348 --> 00:39:42.816
Wait, wait, wait.

543
00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:44.385
Salt is poison.

544
00:39:45.819 --> 00:39:47.454
Who do you think you are?

545
00:39:47.488 --> 00:39:49.790
We don't see you for
I don't know how many years,


546
00:39:49.823 --> 00:39:51.392
and you show up
just like that?


547
00:39:51.425 --> 00:39:52.959
No warning whatsoever.

548
00:39:52.993 --> 00:39:54.661
And you have the nerve
to criticize


549
00:39:54.695 --> 00:39:56.230
the way I take care of her?

550
00:39:56.263 --> 00:39:58.332
Coming here, expecting pity!

551
00:39:58.365 --> 00:39:59.867
Me, pity you?

552
00:40:00.834 --> 00:40:03.003
You were the only one
she ever really cared about.


553
00:40:03.036 --> 00:40:05.572
Her big hope of salvation.

554
00:40:05.606 --> 00:40:07.841
Having a doctor for a son,

555
00:40:07.875 --> 00:40:09.877
only to see him
flee to Holland


556
00:40:09.909 --> 00:40:12.279
without a word of gratitude.

557
00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.750
Did you ever thank her for all
the sacrifices she made for you?


558
00:40:16.784 --> 00:40:18.985
- Sacrifices?
- Yes!


559
00:40:20.854 --> 00:40:23.923
This, uh, this was a mistake.

560
00:40:23.956 --> 00:40:25.592
I shouldn't have come back.

561
00:40:29.797 --> 00:40:30.998
Go on!

562
00:40:31.031 --> 00:40:32.499
Leave!

563
00:40:32.533 --> 00:40:35.436
You selfish, arrogant...

564
00:40:35.469 --> 00:40:38.505
ungrateful coward!

565
00:40:39.807 --> 00:40:41.108
What is wrong
with these people?


566
00:40:41.141 --> 00:40:43.110
How in God's name
can they stand it?


567
00:40:43.143 --> 00:40:44.511
There's no progress.

568
00:40:44.545 --> 00:40:47.281
Nothing changes.
Nothing ever changes here.


569
00:40:47.314 --> 00:40:50.851
Yes, but we have
our own Parliament.


570
00:40:50.884 --> 00:40:53.454
The Dutch no longer rule us.

571
00:40:53.487 --> 00:40:56.089
We have control
of our own resources.


572
00:40:56.123 --> 00:40:59.860
Coco, you really believe
that will make any difference?


573
00:40:59.893 --> 00:41:00.894
Look at them.

574
00:41:00.928 --> 00:41:02.062
Do you think they really care?

575
00:41:02.095 --> 00:41:03.464
Ah, shon.

576
00:41:03.497 --> 00:41:06.400
We do the very best
we can, huh?


577
00:41:06.433 --> 00:41:08.535
We don't have much, but, uh...

578
00:41:09.303 --> 00:41:11.872
we have the sun.

579
00:41:11.905 --> 00:41:13.273
Which is free.

580
00:41:26.119 --> 00:41:28.121
<i>Solema.</i>

581
00:41:28.155 --> 00:41:31.558
<i>Considered the most beautiful
woman on the island.</i>


582
00:41:32.493 --> 00:41:36.063
<i>She believed in Curaçao,
its people,</i>


583
00:41:36.096 --> 00:41:38.065
<i>and the struggle to develop</i>

584
00:41:38.098 --> 00:41:40.868
<i>a uniquely
Kurasoleñonan vision.</i>


585
00:41:42.202 --> 00:41:45.405
<i>She thought she found that
in Manchi,</i>


586
00:41:45.439 --> 00:41:48.709
<i>but she soon discovered
his dogged stubbornness</i>


587
00:41:48.742 --> 00:41:52.913
<i>reflected his ignorance,
not idealism.</i>


588
00:42:19.239 --> 00:42:20.440
Miss Solema.

589
00:42:20.474 --> 00:42:21.842
Ernesto.

590
00:42:22.409 --> 00:42:25.112
You know I play dominoes
with your husband.


591
00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.616
Yes, of course I know that.

592
00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:31.685
And you know
that I admire...


593
00:42:31.718 --> 00:42:33.520
we all admire you.

594
00:42:33.554 --> 00:42:35.055
Very much.

595
00:42:36.223 --> 00:42:38.892
What is it, Ernesto?

596
00:42:38.926 --> 00:42:40.460
There is talk.

597
00:42:40.494 --> 00:42:41.461
Well, who is talking?

598
00:42:41.495 --> 00:42:42.796
Manchi?

599
00:42:46.934 --> 00:42:48.869
All I want to say is,

600
00:42:48.902 --> 00:42:52.706
if you ever need help for any
reason, you can count on me.


601
00:42:52.739 --> 00:42:54.608
I don't understand.

602
00:42:55.742 --> 00:42:57.377
What do you mean?

603
00:42:57.411 --> 00:42:59.646
You know where to find me.

604
00:43:31.912 --> 00:43:33.447
That's very good, Ostrik.

605
00:43:34.214 --> 00:43:36.683
Please continue practicing
the same measures.


606
00:43:36.717 --> 00:43:38.251
I have to go now.

607
00:45:13.847 --> 00:45:15.049
Ah!

608
00:46:28.722 --> 00:46:30.258
Your leg.

609
00:46:31.825 --> 00:46:33.027
Please.

610
00:46:35.495 --> 00:46:37.131
It's a terrible mess.

611
00:46:37.165 --> 00:46:39.133
Please.

612
00:46:39.167 --> 00:46:40.700
I'll take care of it.

613
00:46:56.483 --> 00:46:58.219
You said there was talk

614
00:46:58.252 --> 00:46:59.953
at the domino game.

615
00:47:02.656 --> 00:47:04.391
Who was talking?
Manchi?


616
00:47:05.259 --> 00:47:08.895
I suspect that he is abusing you
in a terrible way.


617
00:47:10.363 --> 00:47:12.833
Perhaps you made
a mistake once.


618
00:47:12.866 --> 00:47:14.835
I don't even know why
I'm saying this.


619
00:47:14.868 --> 00:47:17.305
I don't care.
It is not my business.


620
00:47:18.772 --> 00:47:20.141
You know.

621
00:47:24.312 --> 00:47:27.514
I only suspected Manchi
was trying to drive you mad.


622
00:47:27.547 --> 00:47:29.916
I thought it unjust
that he would paint you...


623
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:32.286
As a whore?

624
00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.856
This is quite possibly
his only original thought.


625
00:47:37.657 --> 00:47:39.693
He must be
extremely proud of it.


626
00:47:40.827 --> 00:47:42.362
I see now.

627
00:47:42.395 --> 00:47:45.799
Manchi is crazy,
and he wants to make you crazy.


628
00:47:45.832 --> 00:47:47.767
That is why I came
to warn you.


629
00:47:47.801 --> 00:47:49.936
No one has the right
to treat another person


630
00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:51.738
the way Manchi does you.

631
00:47:52.806 --> 00:47:54.674
Has he ever
done anything to you?


632
00:47:54.708 --> 00:47:55.942
No.

633
00:47:55.976 --> 00:47:57.178
I just don't like the fact

634
00:47:57.211 --> 00:47:59.347
that he thinks
he's always right.


635
00:48:00.814 --> 00:48:03.317
When two people
cannot get along anymore,


636
00:48:03.351 --> 00:48:06.853
the best solution is for them
to simply let each other go.


637
00:48:07.989 --> 00:48:09.190
You're right.

638
00:48:11.025 --> 00:48:12.592
It would have been better.

639
00:48:14.861 --> 00:48:16.563
He thinks he's got
a hold on you,


640
00:48:16.596 --> 00:48:18.732
but his hold is slipping,

641
00:48:18.765 --> 00:48:20.234
isn't it?

642
00:48:21.735 --> 00:48:23.070
I better go.

643
00:48:25.206 --> 00:48:28.541
Let me say, I... I really like
the way you carry yourself.


644
00:48:29.509 --> 00:48:31.245
Do you mean that?

645
00:48:31.279 --> 00:48:32.646
Yes, I do.

646
00:48:34.115 --> 00:48:36.750
Even after my mistake?

647
00:48:36.783 --> 00:48:39.586
Anyone can make mistakes.

648
00:48:39.619 --> 00:48:42.489
I was born out of wedlock,
myself, as they say.


649
00:48:45.892 --> 00:48:49.096
Well, maybe I'll come visit you
from time to time.


650
00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:50.563
Just to talk.

651
00:48:51.365 --> 00:48:52.766
I have no one.

652
00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.103
You know all my secrets.

653
00:48:56.137 --> 00:48:57.837
You will always be welcome,

654
00:48:57.871 --> 00:49:00.207
but please be careful.

655
00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:36.043
Peekaboo.

656
00:49:39.746 --> 00:49:41.748
Nora.

657
00:49:41.781 --> 00:49:45.319
Chamon, I need ten guilders.

658
00:49:45.353 --> 00:49:48.322
You know when you do it for
money, you ask for it before.


659
00:49:48.356 --> 00:49:50.992
But when you do it for love,
you should wait till after.


660
00:49:51.025 --> 00:49:53.327
It's for the children.

661
00:49:53.361 --> 00:49:54.996
You know, you and me,

662
00:49:56.263 --> 00:49:57.664
we have to stop.

663
00:49:57.697 --> 00:49:59.000
Why?

664
00:49:59.033 --> 00:50:01.335
Bubu is my friend.

665
00:50:01.369 --> 00:50:03.270
I can't stand lying
to him anymore.


666
00:50:03.304 --> 00:50:06.873
All Bubu does
is chase after whores.


667
00:50:09.843 --> 00:50:11.978
He knows I know,

668
00:50:12.013 --> 00:50:14.148
so he doesn't ask
any questions.


669
00:50:14.181 --> 00:50:16.283
One day, he will notice...

670
00:50:16.317 --> 00:50:18.152
and then...

671
00:50:18.185 --> 00:50:20.354
You weren't afraid
of him before.


672
00:50:20.388 --> 00:50:22.522
How come you are now?

673
00:50:22.555 --> 00:50:24.758
Have you become a coward,

674
00:50:24.791 --> 00:50:26.494
little Chamon?

675
00:50:26.526 --> 00:50:28.095
Me a coward?

676
00:50:28.129 --> 00:50:29.863
I'm not afraid of anyone.

677
00:50:32.133 --> 00:50:33.867
You are...

678
00:50:35.069 --> 00:50:38.005
a strong man,

679
00:50:38.039 --> 00:50:39.739
Chamon.

680
00:50:41.075 --> 00:50:42.510
Stop, Nora...

681
00:50:42.575 --> 00:50:43.743
Come on.

682
00:50:44.811 --> 00:50:47.048
I'm warning you.

683
00:50:47.081 --> 00:50:49.183
If you don't help me,

684
00:50:49.216 --> 00:50:51.718
it will be all your fault.

685
00:51:01.195 --> 00:51:02.595
Drink up.

686
00:51:20.914 --> 00:51:22.416
Please.

687
00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:24.784
- Please, Nora.
- Hush.


688
00:51:53.746 --> 00:51:55.216
Dushi.

689
00:51:55.249 --> 00:51:56.683
Off you go now.

690
00:52:55.875 --> 00:52:58.145
These are so beautiful.

691
00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:00.847
Thank you.

692
00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.449
They are not ready yet.

693
00:53:02.483 --> 00:53:04.018
I like them.

694
00:53:05.718 --> 00:53:07.555
Would you make one for me?

695
00:53:10.457 --> 00:53:12.859
You could make a living
from this, you know?


696
00:53:12.892 --> 00:53:15.095
Making tables.

697
00:53:15.129 --> 00:53:16.863
Making furniture.

698
00:53:17.998 --> 00:53:19.500
As a business?

699
00:53:20.401 --> 00:53:22.036
It is not impossible.

700
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:24.004
That is what we need here.

701
00:53:25.339 --> 00:53:28.808
Kurasoleños used to produce
all kinds of things,


702
00:53:28.841 --> 00:53:30.477
then that damned refinery came

703
00:53:30.511 --> 00:53:33.547
destroyed all our motivations
to produce for ourselves.


704
00:53:33.581 --> 00:53:35.848
You should go into politics.

705
00:53:37.850 --> 00:53:40.387
You could be our first
female prime minister!


706
00:53:45.159 --> 00:53:46.360
Come.

707
00:53:58.272 --> 00:54:01.475
This place has never felt
so complete.


708
00:54:01.508 --> 00:54:03.943
It is still a bit incomplete.

709
00:54:15.689 --> 00:54:17.558
I want you to stay.

710
00:54:19.859 --> 00:54:21.595
Manchi is expecting me.

711
00:54:21.629 --> 00:54:23.430
I mean permanently.

712
00:54:23.464 --> 00:54:25.366
Impossible.

713
00:54:25.399 --> 00:54:27.334
I'm married to Manchi.

714
00:54:27.368 --> 00:54:28.835
Nothing is impossible.

715
00:54:28.868 --> 00:54:30.404
You said so yourself.

716
00:54:30.437 --> 00:54:33.674
- Yes, but...
- Why don't you just leave him?


717
00:54:35.842 --> 00:54:37.944
Why can't we just
stay lovers?


718
00:54:40.214 --> 00:54:42.449
If you don't come to me,
I will leave.


719
00:54:44.917 --> 00:54:46.353
What do you mean?

720
00:54:46.387 --> 00:54:48.756
I will go out to sea again.

721
00:54:51.225 --> 00:54:53.327
You don't mean that...

722
00:54:56.463 --> 00:54:57.665
do you?

723
00:55:35.369 --> 00:55:37.738
So you're going
to make me my soup?


724
00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.842
Come.

725
00:56:14.874 --> 00:56:16.110
Don't let it get...

726
00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:20.980
What is wrong with you?

727
00:56:21.014 --> 00:56:23.083
Aren't you forgetting something?

728
00:56:24.017 --> 00:56:25.119
What do you mean?

729
00:56:25.152 --> 00:56:27.087
You're forgetting my money.

730
00:56:27.821 --> 00:56:28.888
Whore.

731
00:56:28.921 --> 00:56:31.225
I am not a whore.

732
00:56:31.258 --> 00:56:32.793
Get me my money.

733
00:56:32.826 --> 00:56:36.397
Or I will tell everyone
what you really are.


734
00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:39.032
You can tell
whoever you like.


735
00:56:40.367 --> 00:56:43.670
I used to admire you
so much, Manchi.


736
00:56:43.704 --> 00:56:45.372
What happened to you?

737
00:56:45.406 --> 00:56:48.409
I used to think that any man
who could build his own house


738
00:56:48.442 --> 00:56:50.977
was capable of great things.

739
00:56:51.011 --> 00:56:54.548
But this... this house
is all you are;


740
00:56:54.581 --> 00:56:56.650
all you could ever be.

741
00:56:56.683 --> 00:57:00.154
Something you copied
from a postcard.


742
00:57:00.187 --> 00:57:01.655
Something you saw in a magaz...

743
00:57:01.688 --> 00:57:03.056
Whore!

744
00:57:04.191 --> 00:57:05.659
Poor Manchi.

745
00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:09.263
Is that the best you can do?

746
00:57:09.296 --> 00:57:11.131
Are you going to
get me my money?


747
00:57:12.266 --> 00:57:13.500
Hm?

748
00:57:31.718 --> 00:57:34.521
Put something on top of it
so it doesn't blow away.


749
00:57:38.325 --> 00:57:40.360
Mm.

750
00:57:41.929 --> 00:57:44.198
Excellent soup.

751
00:57:44.231 --> 00:57:46.467
You might be worth
ten guilders now.


752
00:58:10.791 --> 00:58:13.260
<i>That fateful final game</i>

753
00:58:13.293 --> 00:58:16.096
<i>began like any other.</i>

754
00:58:18.131 --> 00:58:19.399
Mm.

755
00:58:42.322 --> 00:58:43.624
Mm.

756
00:58:45.225 --> 00:58:46.995
Oh...

757
00:59:33.206 --> 00:59:34.775
You're going somewhere?

758
00:59:36.209 --> 00:59:37.911
Hey, Manchi.

759
00:59:37.945 --> 00:59:40.247
Manchi, Manchi, Manchi...

760
00:59:42.849 --> 00:59:44.585
What is the deal
with the shoes?


761
00:59:44.618 --> 00:59:46.653
Come up with a better
way to keep score here.


762
00:59:46.687 --> 00:59:51.158
Hey, we will hang the shoes
in the tree to keep score.


763
00:59:51.191 --> 00:59:54.528
Lose ten games with them,

764
00:59:54.561 --> 00:59:56.363
get one shoe.

765
00:59:56.396 --> 00:59:57.764
Hey, no, no, no.

766
00:59:57.798 --> 01:00:01.768
Please, please, our guests
are drying out.


767
01:00:01.802 --> 01:00:04.072
All right.

768
01:00:04.104 --> 01:00:05.606
We'll take black.

769
01:00:15.482 --> 01:00:17.085
Hey, hey.

770
01:00:17.117 --> 01:00:19.353
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, Chamon!


771
01:00:19.386 --> 01:00:20.554
Chamon!

772
01:00:20.587 --> 01:00:22.422
Mm.

773
01:00:22.456 --> 01:00:24.157
What we doing
with the shoes?


774
01:00:25.225 --> 01:00:27.095
<i>Dominoes, like life,</i>

775
01:00:27.127 --> 01:00:28.595
<i>is a game of chance.</i>

776
01:00:28.629 --> 01:00:31.131
<i>It's how you play
that matters.</i>


777
01:00:31.164 --> 01:00:32.799
In the past,

778
01:00:32.833 --> 01:00:34.935
there was a toll
on the floating bridge in town.


779
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:38.939
Everybody had to pay
to cross it.


780
01:00:38.972 --> 01:00:41.608
Those without shoes
could cross for free.


781
01:00:45.445 --> 01:00:49.083
To give a man shoes shows
that you are above him.


782
01:00:49.117 --> 01:00:52.252
It's like
calling him a beggar.


783
01:00:52.285 --> 01:00:53.887
So humiliation, then.

784
01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.822
- Mm-hmm.
- Nice.


785
01:00:55.856 --> 01:00:58.625
So, Manchi...

786
01:00:58.659 --> 01:01:00.861
let's give our friends
some shoes, eh?


787
01:01:00.894 --> 01:01:03.163
<i>Double-six opens.</i>

788
01:01:21.149 --> 01:01:24.317
<i>It is a game
of cunning intuition.</i>


789
01:01:24.351 --> 01:01:27.754
<i>One has to anticipate
the other players' moves.</i>


790
01:01:27.788 --> 01:01:30.190
<i>Keeping track of stones played,</i>

791
01:01:30.223 --> 01:01:31.425
<i>when they were played,</i>

792
01:01:31.458 --> 01:01:33.094
<i>and who played them.</i>

793
01:01:33.127 --> 01:01:35.629
<i>And, at the decisive moment...</i>

794
01:01:35.662 --> 01:01:38.565
- Ay!
- <i>Forcing your opponent to pass.</i>


795
01:01:40.068 --> 01:01:42.669
<i>Doubles, except the double-six,</i>

796
01:01:42.703 --> 01:01:44.671
<i>are widely detested.</i>

797
01:01:44.705 --> 01:01:47.175
<i>None more so
than the double-four;</i>


798
01:01:47.207 --> 01:01:49.543
<i>evoking unpleasant associations</i>

799
01:01:49.576 --> 01:01:53.147
<i>with the four candles
that burn beside the coffin.</i>


800
01:01:53.181 --> 01:01:56.783
<i>It makes the player
who receives it often feel</i>


801
01:01:56.817 --> 01:01:59.187
<i>that death is sounding him out.</i>

802
01:02:03.924 --> 01:02:06.326
Mm.

803
01:02:06.359 --> 01:02:07.494
I need to talk to you.

804
01:02:07.527 --> 01:02:09.796
Mwah!
Move your butt.


805
01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:14.968
<i>The team
that reaches ten points</i>


806
01:02:15.002 --> 01:02:17.704
<i>before the opposing team
reaches five</i>


807
01:02:17.738 --> 01:02:19.740
<i>wins the right
to give the other team</i>


808
01:02:19.773 --> 01:02:21.808
<i>a pair of "sapatu,"</i>

809
01:02:22.876 --> 01:02:24.845
<i>or shoes.</i>

810
01:02:24.878 --> 01:02:28.682
Bubu, I heard the taxi drivers
want to form a union,


811
01:02:28.715 --> 01:02:31.518
and that you will be elected
as the president.


812
01:02:31.551 --> 01:02:34.155
- I heard it, too.
- Mm-hmm.


813
01:02:34.188 --> 01:02:35.589
No, no.

814
01:02:35.622 --> 01:02:37.724
I have enough problems
as it is.


815
01:02:37.758 --> 01:02:41.095
So why is everybody saying that
you will be elected president?


816
01:02:41.129 --> 01:02:42.896
Well...

817
01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:50.238
I can't believe it, man.

818
01:02:53.974 --> 01:02:55.609
You cannot take all the people.

819
01:02:55.642 --> 01:02:57.111
You can't take all the people.

820
01:03:02.749 --> 01:03:04.518
- Let's go talk to Bubu.
- Yeah, let's go.


821
01:03:04.551 --> 01:03:06.319
- Bubu!
- Let's go there.


822
01:03:11.591 --> 01:03:13.527
Hey, Bubu,
can you believe this, man?


823
01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.562
There should be a law
against these buses, man.


824
01:03:15.595 --> 01:03:17.131
They're stealing
all of our customers.


825
01:03:17.165 --> 01:03:19.133
Some of the guys
have been talking


826
01:03:19.167 --> 01:03:21.468
about putting a union together.

827
01:03:21.501 --> 01:03:22.869
What do you think, Bubu?

828
01:03:22.903 --> 01:03:24.771
Right!
The union, Bubu.


829
01:03:24.805 --> 01:03:27.541
- Putting the union together.
- Okay. Okay.


830
01:03:27.574 --> 01:03:29.309
Ah!

831
01:03:29.342 --> 01:03:30.977
What are you looking at?

832
01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:35.116
Mm.

833
01:03:48.361 --> 01:03:51.032
Okay, okay, okay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!


834
01:03:53.834 --> 01:03:55.635
Hey, stop, stop, stop...

835
01:03:56.937 --> 01:03:58.839
Oh, of course!

836
01:04:15.522 --> 01:04:18.326
Yeah! Yeah!

837
01:04:21.661 --> 01:04:23.864
Get him!
Get him, that's right.


838
01:04:23.897 --> 01:04:25.532
- Let's do this, yeah!
- Hi.


839
01:04:25.565 --> 01:04:27.534
Hey, Bubu.
This is my job, man.


840
01:04:27.567 --> 01:04:30.503
Hey, you've been stealing
our customers for too long.


841
01:04:30.537 --> 01:04:33.807
So now, you leave
or you face the consequences.


842
01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:35.276
Yeah!

843
01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:36.543
Go.

844
01:04:39.713 --> 01:04:42.016
It is good to have a union.

845
01:04:43.683 --> 01:04:45.552
You sound like a communist.

846
01:04:45.585 --> 01:04:47.355
I am not a communist,

847
01:04:47.387 --> 01:04:49.456
but I ask you this:

848
01:04:49.489 --> 01:04:50.523
who owns the buses?

849
01:04:50.557 --> 01:04:51.791
Who owns the hotels?

850
01:04:51.825 --> 01:04:54.128
Foreigners,
and that is who?


851
01:04:54.161 --> 01:04:58.232
Do you think they would let
a Kurasoleño run the refinery?


852
01:04:58.266 --> 01:05:01.302
Could a Kurasoleño ever become
manager of the Hilton?


853
01:05:01.335 --> 01:05:03.803
If he has ability
and application.


854
01:05:03.837 --> 01:05:05.639
Come on now.

855
01:05:05.672 --> 01:05:08.175
Either you don't want to see
or you're really stupid.


856
01:05:08.209 --> 01:05:10.344
- Hey.
- This is modern slavery.


857
01:05:10.378 --> 01:05:12.846
We, Black men, have to take
control of our destiny.


858
01:05:12.879 --> 01:05:15.316
Hey, you and your Black power.

859
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:17.151
Negroes can't govern.

860
01:05:17.184 --> 01:05:19.320
It's been proven often enough.

861
01:05:19.353 --> 01:05:21.155
They're lazy

862
01:05:21.188 --> 01:05:23.324
and have no sense
of responsibility.


863
01:05:23.357 --> 01:05:25.926
Ernesto, please enough
of this foolishness.


864
01:05:25.959 --> 01:05:29.663
Hey, it's a de-mo-cra-cy.

865
01:05:29.696 --> 01:05:31.765
The best system there is.

866
01:05:31.798 --> 01:05:35.002
Politics is always corrupt.

867
01:05:35.036 --> 01:05:37.204
What it comes down to is this.

868
01:05:37.238 --> 01:05:40.107
A young girl is brought
to a doctor unconscious.


869
01:05:40.141 --> 01:05:43.743
Instead of reviving her,
which is his duty as a doctor,


870
01:05:43.777 --> 01:05:45.912
he lifts up her skirt
and fucks her.


871
01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.217
That is what our politicians
are doing to our people,


872
01:05:50.251 --> 01:05:53.421
and they allow foreigners
to join the gangbang!


873
01:05:53.453 --> 01:05:55.956
Only the people
can correct this.


874
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:59.193
But they have to be
educated politically


875
01:05:59.226 --> 01:06:02.196
before there can be any question
of your de-mo-cra-cy.


876
01:06:02.229 --> 01:06:03.197
You understand?

877
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:05.066
Education.

878
01:06:05.099 --> 01:06:06.933
Our people have
to have education!


879
01:06:06.967 --> 01:06:09.203
Education. Do you know what
happens if you keep on exploiting


880
01:06:09.236 --> 01:06:12.772
people's ignorance
instead of educating them?


881
01:06:12.806 --> 01:06:15.276
We'll have a revolution
on this island.


882
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:17.411
A real violent revolution...

883
01:06:17.445 --> 01:06:18.878
Just like in Cuba.

884
01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.450
That sounds very familiar.

885
01:06:24.285 --> 01:06:27.321
No, we don't want
Communism here.


886
01:06:27.355 --> 01:06:28.822
Mm-mm.

887
01:06:28.855 --> 01:06:30.424
You know, in Cuba,

888
01:06:30.458 --> 01:06:32.559
all the whores drive buses!

889
01:06:32.592 --> 01:06:34.328
Or would you rather them
drive taxis?


890
01:06:34.362 --> 01:06:36.397
Manchi, it's true.

891
01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:37.831
There are no whores left!

892
01:06:37.864 --> 01:06:40.500
Castro makes all of them
drive buses.


893
01:06:40.533 --> 01:06:42.003
Good for them.

894
01:06:42.036 --> 01:06:43.937
We've got to start
loving this country more,


895
01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:45.939
and our women, especially.

896
01:06:45.972 --> 01:06:49.642
All the whores are now
bus drivers.


897
01:06:49.676 --> 01:06:51.245
Imagine that.

898
01:06:51.278 --> 01:06:53.114
Imagine this.

899
01:06:53.147 --> 01:06:54.681
Sapatu number two.

900
01:06:57.517 --> 01:07:00.287
I had threes.
You know I had threes.


901
01:07:00.321 --> 01:07:01.521
You win some, you lose some.

902
01:07:02.689 --> 01:07:03.923
Hm?

903
01:07:04.824 --> 01:07:06.659
Mm-mm!

904
01:07:06.693 --> 01:07:09.662
I won one, just one,
but you lose every game.


905
01:07:12.832 --> 01:07:13.967
We haven't given them
one shoe yet.


906
01:07:14.001 --> 01:07:15.602
Mm!

907
01:07:17.038 --> 01:07:19.672
This will wake us up.

908
01:07:19.706 --> 01:07:21.042
Mm.

909
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:25.879
What a woman, hm?

910
01:07:28.349 --> 01:07:30.217
No, they're coming here today.

911
01:07:30.251 --> 01:07:31.318
Who?

912
01:07:31.352 --> 01:07:32.819
The taxi drivers.

913
01:07:32.852 --> 01:07:34.221
All of them?

914
01:07:34.255 --> 01:07:36.390
Ya, ya, ya.

915
01:07:36.424 --> 01:07:39.626
They're going to elect me
by acclamation.


916
01:07:39.659 --> 01:07:41.162
Whatever that means.

917
01:07:41.195 --> 01:07:43.464
"By acclamation" means
there's no need to vote.


918
01:07:43.497 --> 01:07:45.499
They just say "Bubu Fiel"!

919
01:07:45.533 --> 01:07:47.234
"Bubu Fiel"!
"Bubu Fiel"!


920
01:07:48.768 --> 01:07:50.737
- For president?
- Yeah.


921
01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:53.807
And you thought you married
an idiot, hm?


922
01:07:54.542 --> 01:07:56.510
Do you want to know the words
from the sermon this morning?


923
01:07:56.544 --> 01:07:57.677
Mm.

924
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:59.547
"I asked for bread,

925
01:07:59.579 --> 01:08:01.781
"and you have given me
a stone."


926
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:05.052
No...

927
01:08:09.256 --> 01:08:10.790
Pshh.

928
01:08:14.095 --> 01:08:17.164
If I am elected president,

929
01:08:17.198 --> 01:08:19.966
these meetings, they'd be held
here in my house.


930
01:08:21.068 --> 01:08:23.037
Nora and I,
we always say,


931
01:08:23.070 --> 01:08:25.872
no one can visit the house
without a drink.


932
01:08:28.409 --> 01:08:30.511
Where will I get the money
for that?


933
01:08:35.216 --> 01:08:38.751
<i>Sometimes,
it was all too much for her.</i>


934
01:08:40.221 --> 01:08:42.123
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

935
01:08:42.156 --> 01:08:43.957
Oh!

936
01:08:43.991 --> 01:08:45.493
Ah!

937
01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.827
Nora.

938
01:08:52.333 --> 01:08:53.601
Nora.

939
01:08:57.338 --> 01:09:00.241
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh.

940
01:09:00.274 --> 01:09:02.443
What's wrong, huh?

941
01:09:02.476 --> 01:09:03.776
Nothing.

942
01:09:04.612 --> 01:09:09.283
It's just... sometimes,
I don't know how we'll survive.


943
01:09:09.316 --> 01:09:10.551
Survive?

944
01:09:10.584 --> 01:09:12.419
We don't have any money, Bubu.

945
01:09:12.453 --> 01:09:14.321
We never have money.

946
01:09:15.256 --> 01:09:18.925
I don't know how
I can feed the children.


947
01:09:18.958 --> 01:09:21.562
Ostrik can't go to school.

948
01:09:24.298 --> 01:09:26.666
We still don't have
a real toilet.


949
01:09:28.202 --> 01:09:29.637
Sometimes, it just...

950
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:31.804
it feels so hopeless.

951
01:09:31.838 --> 01:09:35.009
Listen, listen, mm... listen.

952
01:09:35.609 --> 01:09:38.445
Listen, everything will be
all right, dushi.


953
01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:40.247
Mm, listen.

954
01:09:40.281 --> 01:09:41.415
Mm.

955
01:09:43.384 --> 01:09:44.918
I will fix it.

956
01:09:44.951 --> 01:09:45.952
I promise.

957
01:09:45.985 --> 01:09:47.121
Hm?

958
01:09:47.154 --> 01:09:48.522
I promise.

959
01:09:49.657 --> 01:09:51.192
What did you eat today?

960
01:09:52.626 --> 01:09:54.761
- Nothing.
- Nothing?


961
01:09:55.129 --> 01:09:56.430
Mm.

962
01:09:58.165 --> 01:10:00.201
That is why you feel bad,
my dushi.


963
01:10:08.908 --> 01:10:11.945
I know how to make you
feel better, mi dushi.


964
01:10:22.722 --> 01:10:25.226
And, after that...

965
01:10:25.259 --> 01:10:27.394
after that,
we'll make you a meal.


966
01:10:58.692 --> 01:11:00.127
<i>Bubu.</i>

967
01:11:10.903 --> 01:11:13.407
Bubu!

968
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.276
- Don't go.
- I have to go.


969
01:11:15.309 --> 01:11:16.577
No, I want more.

970
01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:18.045
More, more, more, more.

971
01:11:20.247 --> 01:11:21.948
Ostrik, do you want
to come with me


972
01:11:21.981 --> 01:11:23.850
- win the jackpot?
- Yeah!


973
01:11:23.883 --> 01:11:25.885
Yeah? Yeah?

974
01:11:25.918 --> 01:11:27.854
Mwah!
Say good-bye to your mama.


975
01:11:27.887 --> 01:11:30.591
- Mi dushi, bye.
- Bye.


976
01:11:30.624 --> 01:11:32.626
Mm-hmm.

977
01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:35.928
Get in, get in, get in, get in.
Mm.


978
01:11:36.829 --> 01:11:37.930
Don't look.

979
01:11:41.001 --> 01:11:43.936
I'll fix this.
I promise, okay?


980
01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:45.439
Trust me.

981
01:11:45.472 --> 01:11:46.674
Trust me.

982
01:11:48.342 --> 01:11:49.543
Jackpot.

983
01:11:51.612 --> 01:11:55.282
<i>My father was very
aware of his shortcomings</i>


984
01:11:55.316 --> 01:11:58.419
<i>and always expected
that moment of redemption</i>


985
01:11:58.452 --> 01:12:00.254
<i>to magically appear.</i>

986
01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:07.294
<i>All he needed was
one of his lucky days.</i>


987
01:12:10.097 --> 01:12:11.398
Mm.

988
01:12:12.433 --> 01:12:15.502
Don't forget,
the ship sails at dusk.


989
01:12:15.536 --> 01:12:17.071
Are you sure you don't want
to come with us


990
01:12:17.104 --> 01:12:18.572
to buy some new shirts?

991
01:12:18.605 --> 01:12:20.741
Yeah, I would love
to spend my days shopping.


992
01:12:20.774 --> 01:12:21.974
No, I'm just kidding.

993
01:12:22.009 --> 01:12:24.645
Um, tell you what,
you have fun.


994
01:12:24.678 --> 01:12:27.514
She gets anything she wants,
anything she points at.


995
01:12:27.548 --> 01:12:29.916
Be good, okay?

996
01:12:29.949 --> 01:12:32.286
I just wanna... I just wanna
to check out the island.


997
01:12:32.319 --> 01:12:33.721
- Okay.
- Okay?


998
01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:37.825
- Hello.
- Hello.


999
01:12:37.857 --> 01:12:39.193
Where to, sir?

1000
01:12:39.226 --> 01:12:41.261
I, uh...

1001
01:12:41.295 --> 01:12:44.331
I heard you have
a very famous, uh,


1002
01:12:44.365 --> 01:12:46.600
entertainment center.

1003
01:12:46.633 --> 01:12:49.670
- Campo Alegre.
- Yes. That's it.


1004
01:12:49.703 --> 01:12:50.771
Okay.

1005
01:12:50.804 --> 01:12:54.007
No, if I may say so,

1006
01:12:54.041 --> 01:12:56.943
you cannot leave the island
without visiting Campo


1007
01:12:56.976 --> 01:12:58.545
at least one time.

1008
01:12:58.579 --> 01:13:00.581
So I've heard.

1009
01:13:01.248 --> 01:13:03.384
Not that I would know,

1010
01:13:03.417 --> 01:13:06.953
but the girls are wonderful.

1011
01:13:06.986 --> 01:13:10.991
Ay, the Dominicans, Venezuelans,

1012
01:13:11.024 --> 01:13:13.293
Colombians.

1013
01:13:13.327 --> 01:13:15.396
Only foreign girls
are allowed.


1014
01:13:15.429 --> 01:13:18.965
They don't just hire anybody
there, no, no.


1015
01:13:18.999 --> 01:13:21.135
Plus, they check them
every week,


1016
01:13:21.168 --> 01:13:24.605
so no...
Funky diseases.


1017
01:13:26.073 --> 01:13:27.574
Yeah?

1018
01:13:29.777 --> 01:13:31.078
Campo?

1019
01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.581
Campo!

1020
01:13:43.257 --> 01:13:45.492
Okay, look it.
I don't have much time.


1021
01:13:45.526 --> 01:13:47.661
Ship's gonna leave in one hour.

1022
01:13:47.694 --> 01:13:49.163
Twenty bucks.

1023
01:13:49.196 --> 01:13:50.597
There's another twenty
in it for you


1024
01:13:50.631 --> 01:13:52.332
if you are waiting for me
when I come out.


1025
01:13:52.366 --> 01:13:54.234
- Okay.
- Okay, don't go anywhere.


1026
01:13:54.268 --> 01:13:56.203
You're the boss.
You're the boss.


1027
01:13:56.236 --> 01:13:57.970
Hey!

1028
01:13:58.971 --> 01:14:00.174
Hello.

1029
01:14:19.827 --> 01:14:21.762
Chairman Bubu!

1030
01:14:23.497 --> 01:14:25.699
Uh-uh-uh-uh, no,
I'm not chairman.


1031
01:14:25.732 --> 01:14:27.234
- I have enough troubles.
- Yeah, you are. - No!


1032
01:14:27.267 --> 01:14:28.968
Chairman, why you saying
you're not chairman?


1033
01:14:29.002 --> 01:14:31.805
You are here with us,
the people.


1034
01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.075
Yeah, our current chairman keeps
to the Southwest side


1035
01:14:35.108 --> 01:14:37.044
of the island at the big
Hilton hotel there.


1036
01:14:37.077 --> 01:14:39.780
Our Bubu is here.
Our Bubu.


1037
01:14:39.813 --> 01:14:42.316
- Abajo los Yanquis!
- Nixon go home!


1038
01:14:51.191 --> 01:14:52.860
- Ah, ah?
- Ah.


1039
01:14:55.796 --> 01:14:57.464
Hey, hey.
Hey, Bubu.


1040
01:14:57.498 --> 01:15:00.067
Think about it.
Think about it.


1041
01:15:01.802 --> 01:15:04.371
Bubu!

1042
01:15:32.232 --> 01:15:33.600
Bubu.

1043
01:15:36.069 --> 01:15:37.538
What are you doing out here?

1044
01:15:37.571 --> 01:15:39.039
Why don't you come in?

1045
01:15:39.072 --> 01:15:41.875
No, no, you know.
I can't.


1046
01:15:41.909 --> 01:15:43.610
Ay, Bubu,
but it's a special day.


1047
01:15:43.644 --> 01:15:45.612
- Mm.
- It's my birthday.


1048
01:15:45.646 --> 01:15:47.481
Is it?

1049
01:15:47.514 --> 01:15:49.516
Hey, Ostrik, it's...

1050
01:15:51.019 --> 01:15:53.787
That's wonderful.

1051
01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:56.189
It's wonderful.
Congratulations, but really, no.


1052
01:15:56.223 --> 01:15:58.559
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I can't. Not today.


1053
01:15:58.592 --> 01:16:00.561
Can't you just come in
for a little while?


1054
01:16:00.594 --> 01:16:03.530
- Mm...
- Come on, it's my birthday,


1055
01:16:03.564 --> 01:16:05.632
and you're my best friend.

1056
01:16:05.666 --> 01:16:07.001
I can't.
I can't.


1057
01:16:07.035 --> 01:16:09.102
Por favor, please.

1058
01:16:11.104 --> 01:16:13.073
I ca... eh...

1059
01:16:15.742 --> 01:16:17.411
Come on.

1060
01:16:17.444 --> 01:16:19.013
It's one drink, Micha.

1061
01:16:19.047 --> 01:16:20.480
Okay, okay.

1062
01:16:22.449 --> 01:16:23.884
All right.

1063
01:16:25.218 --> 01:16:26.753
Ostrik.

1064
01:16:31.025 --> 01:16:33.160
Okay, so you...

1065
01:16:33.193 --> 01:16:36.096
I want you to go,

1066
01:16:36.129 --> 01:16:38.665
go and you get some ice cream.

1067
01:16:38.699 --> 01:16:39.900
Okay?

1068
01:16:41.635 --> 01:16:44.237
Take... and don't tell mama.

1069
01:16:44.271 --> 01:16:47.008
Okay?
Today's my lucky day.


1070
01:16:47.041 --> 01:16:49.176
Jackpot.

1071
01:16:49.209 --> 01:16:50.477
Hm?

1072
01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:03.091
Nines, Jacks, full house...!

1073
01:17:07.095 --> 01:17:10.697
Bubu, full, Queens and tens.

1074
01:17:13.567 --> 01:17:14.968
Sixes, man.

1075
01:17:15.003 --> 01:17:17.437
All mine, all mine.

1076
01:17:34.088 --> 01:17:36.223
I want everybody out.

1077
01:17:36.256 --> 01:17:38.725
- Get out!
- What's wrong, Micha?


1078
01:17:38.759 --> 01:17:40.527
- There's no respect here.
- Come on.


1079
01:17:42.295 --> 01:17:43.864
- Get out.
- Ay!


1080
01:17:46.933 --> 01:17:49.070
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1081
01:17:49.103 --> 01:17:50.404
You stay.

1082
01:17:54.508 --> 01:17:56.176
My American is waiting.

1083
01:17:56.209 --> 01:17:58.412
I don't care.

1084
01:17:58.445 --> 01:18:00.447
This is my party,

1085
01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.549
and I want your company.

1086
01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:10.590
Hey.
Why so sad?


1087
01:18:10.624 --> 01:18:13.393
Hm?
This is your birthday.


1088
01:18:14.628 --> 01:18:17.098
- It's not.
- But you said...


1089
01:18:18.298 --> 01:18:20.767
It's my daughter's birthday.

1090
01:18:24.471 --> 01:18:26.573
She's eight now.

1091
01:18:27.574 --> 01:18:28.675
Mm.

1092
01:18:30.844 --> 01:18:33.580
Come, come, come, come.
Shh, shh, shh.


1093
01:18:34.414 --> 01:18:36.583
I miss her so much.

1094
01:19:04.244 --> 01:19:06.379
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
That's my taxi.


1095
01:19:06.413 --> 01:19:07.547
- No! No!
- It's right there.


1096
01:19:07.581 --> 01:19:10.484
No, no.

1097
01:19:38.612 --> 01:19:39.980
Hey!

1098
01:19:40.014 --> 01:19:41.414
What the...?
What are you doing here?


1099
01:19:44.484 --> 01:19:46.187
Stop!
Please, stop!


1100
01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:48.055
Go back!
Go back!


1101
01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:58.832
- Go, go, go, go!
- Come on, come on.


1102
01:20:00.433 --> 01:20:01.802
Bubu's car!

1103
01:20:08.842 --> 01:20:10.343
<i>Ay, papi!</i>

1104
01:20:13.346 --> 01:20:15.448
It's your damn father's fault
we're in this mess.


1105
01:20:15.482 --> 01:20:16.650
Look at this guy.

1106
01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.290
Please stop, stop!

1107
01:20:22.322 --> 01:20:23.623
Please!

1108
01:20:27.195 --> 01:20:28.162
Hold on.

1109
01:20:28.196 --> 01:20:30.164
Whoa!
Whoa!


1110
01:21:09.703 --> 01:21:12.439
Uh, guys,
please do not call the police.


1111
01:21:12.472 --> 01:21:14.507
I didn't actually mean to do
anything wrong.


1112
01:21:14.541 --> 01:21:16.043
I've got to get to that ship,

1113
01:21:16.077 --> 01:21:18.012
because my wife will kill me.

1114
01:21:23.583 --> 01:21:25.552
Do any of you have wives?

1115
01:21:27.654 --> 01:21:29.456
Your dushi.

1116
01:21:29.489 --> 01:21:31.125
Your dushi's magic.

1117
01:21:31.158 --> 01:21:33.793
My first husband
used to tell me that.


1118
01:21:33.827 --> 01:21:36.463
- Mm.
- He loved my chocha.


1119
01:21:36.496 --> 01:21:37.731
Mm-hmm.

1120
01:21:37.764 --> 01:21:39.432
Your first husband?

1121
01:21:40.268 --> 01:21:42.136
What happened to him?

1122
01:21:43.337 --> 01:21:45.805
He was murdered by Trujillo.

1123
01:21:47.507 --> 01:21:49.243
I'm sorry.

1124
01:21:49.277 --> 01:21:51.345
I'm sorry, Micha.

1125
01:21:51.379 --> 01:21:54.015
That was a long time ago.

1126
01:21:54.048 --> 01:21:55.749
Another life.

1127
01:22:04.457 --> 01:22:06.493
Ay, what is it?

1128
01:22:06.526 --> 01:22:08.728
Urgent phone call
for Bubu Fiel!


1129
01:22:10.031 --> 01:22:11.431
Hey.
Bubu.


1130
01:22:11.464 --> 01:22:13.200
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

1131
01:22:13.234 --> 01:22:14.935
What, what...

1132
01:22:14.968 --> 01:22:17.271
Ah,
Well, what does he look like?


1133
01:22:21.574 --> 01:22:22.742
Koño!

1134
01:22:37.657 --> 01:22:39.459
Come on, Bubu.

1135
01:22:39.492 --> 01:22:41.528
- Talk to him, Bubu.
- You're the man, Bubu.


1136
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:44.631
I'm going to give

1137
01:22:44.664 --> 01:22:47.101
my friend here
a special price.


1138
01:22:47.134 --> 01:22:48.969
- No, no!
- Make him pay!


1139
01:22:49.003 --> 01:22:51.439
- Make him pay!
- Make him pay!


1140
01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:54.308
Car damages...

1141
01:22:55.842 --> 01:22:57.911
100 guilders.

1142
01:23:01.581 --> 01:23:05.453
Hours lost by my colleagues...

1143
01:23:08.422 --> 01:23:13.127
And for the kidnapping
of my beloved son...


1144
01:23:14.861 --> 01:23:17.664
Oh, my baby.

1145
01:23:17.697 --> 01:23:19.733
500 guilders to share.

1146
01:23:22.702 --> 01:23:25.339
And for the union...

1147
01:23:25.373 --> 01:23:27.475
The union!
The union!


1148
01:23:27.507 --> 01:23:30.311
The union... as a donation...

1149
01:23:34.614 --> 01:23:36.150
1,000 guilders!

1150
01:23:38.818 --> 01:23:42.089
Pay, pay, pay, pay, pay!

1151
01:23:46.893 --> 01:23:50.297
Bubu, Bubu, Bubu, Bubu!

1152
01:23:57.537 --> 01:24:00.840
- You have to be 18, kid.
- Bubu, Bubu, Bubu, Bubu!


1153
01:24:30.071 --> 01:24:33.740
<i>They thought they were
getting back at their oppressors,</i>


1154
01:24:33.773 --> 01:24:35.209
<i>but...</i>

1155
01:24:41.015 --> 01:24:44.584
<i>They finally have the money
to start a union,</i>


1156
01:24:44.617 --> 01:24:46.420
<i>and what do they do?</i>

1157
01:26:27.687 --> 01:26:31.691
Mm, hey, you're going to be
a doctor some day.


1158
01:26:31.724 --> 01:26:33.027
I promise you.
Hey!


1159
01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:35.262
I promise you,
you're not...


1160
01:26:35.296 --> 01:26:36.763
you're not going to be a...

1161
01:26:36.796 --> 01:26:39.699
a taxi driver bum like me.

1162
01:26:39.732 --> 01:26:41.502
No, no, no.

1163
01:26:42.835 --> 01:26:45.105
Hm? It's like your mama
always says.


1164
01:26:45.139 --> 01:26:46.574
Come, mm.

1165
01:27:01.622 --> 01:27:04.958
<i>Of course,
I forgave him.</i>


1166
01:27:04.992 --> 01:27:08.229
<i>How can you not love a man
for having fun?</i>


1167
01:27:13.534 --> 01:27:15.169
Where are we going?

1168
01:27:15.202 --> 01:27:16.869
The hotel is the other way.

1169
01:27:16.903 --> 01:27:18.339
If you don't mind, shon,

1170
01:27:18.372 --> 01:27:20.641
I have a place for you to go.

1171
01:27:20.674 --> 01:27:23.077
Coco, I'm not in the mood.

1172
01:27:23.776 --> 01:27:25.412
I insist.

1173
01:27:56.477 --> 01:27:57.844
Here.

1174
01:27:58.911 --> 01:28:00.114
Shon.

1175
01:28:01.749 --> 01:28:03.517
Uh, Ostrik.
Please call me Ostrik.


1176
01:28:03.550 --> 01:28:05.586
Okay.
Shon Ostrik.


1177
01:28:10.224 --> 01:28:13.761
Shon, meet Solaica.

1178
01:28:15.729 --> 01:28:18.132
<i>Mucho gusto.
Solaica.</i>


1179
01:28:19.266 --> 01:28:21.135
- And when I come back...
- Mm-hmm.


1180
01:28:21.168 --> 01:28:23.304
I'm gonna have
a dance with you.


1181
01:28:27.074 --> 01:28:28.908
- Is she, uh...
- Yes, she is.


1182
01:28:28.941 --> 01:28:30.977
That is my bi-side.

1183
01:28:31.011 --> 01:28:33.113
- Bi-side?
- Bi-side.


1184
01:28:33.147 --> 01:28:34.481
Is that mistress?

1185
01:28:36.517 --> 01:28:38.352
Everybody has a bi-side.

1186
01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:40.953
Even the women?

1187
01:28:42.122 --> 01:28:44.391
Why do you need a bi-side?

1188
01:28:44.425 --> 01:28:46.126
What about your wife?

1189
01:28:46.794 --> 01:28:48.996
How do you think we've been
married for so many years?


1190
01:28:49.929 --> 01:28:54.068
Shon, if you eat
chocolate ice cream every day,


1191
01:28:54.101 --> 01:28:55.703
what do you think will happen?

1192
01:28:57.204 --> 01:28:58.971
You become sick
of chocolate ice cream.


1193
01:28:59.006 --> 01:29:00.107
Exactly.

1194
01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:01.408
You have to make a switch.

1195
01:29:01.442 --> 01:29:04.345
Strawberry, vanilla, chocolate.

1196
01:29:08.449 --> 01:29:10.150
I love my wife very much,
and she loves me.


1197
01:29:10.184 --> 01:29:12.753
I provide for her,

1198
01:29:12.786 --> 01:29:14.954
so she asks me
no questions, huh?


1199
01:29:14.987 --> 01:29:17.257
She is number one.

1200
01:29:17.291 --> 01:29:20.927
But never let two women think
that they're number one.


1201
01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:23.497
Huh?
That could prove fatal.


1202
01:29:24.231 --> 01:29:25.532
But...

1203
01:29:27.067 --> 01:29:28.335
Solaica.

1204
01:29:29.303 --> 01:29:31.171
She has a high pussy.

1205
01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:34.041
Coco...

1206
01:29:34.808 --> 01:29:36.777
I am a doctor.

1207
01:29:36.810 --> 01:29:38.878
What, exactly,
does that mean?


1208
01:29:41.482 --> 01:29:43.117
Hey, Fernando.

1209
01:29:43.150 --> 01:29:44.818
Give this man another beer.

1210
01:29:44.852 --> 01:29:46.754
He needs it.

1211
01:29:47.554 --> 01:29:48.888
<i>Venga.</i>

1212
01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:30.884
<i>Hey!</i>

1213
01:32:42.896 --> 01:32:44.264
The chicken.

1214
01:32:48.769 --> 01:32:50.771
Two chicken pastechis.

1215
01:32:58.412 --> 01:32:59.713
There he is,
over there.


1216
01:32:59.746 --> 01:33:01.615
Alexi, ah!

1217
01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:04.851
Thank you.

1218
01:33:56.303 --> 01:33:57.504
Delicious.

1219
01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:01.174
Mm.

1220
01:34:02.476 --> 01:34:04.978
Remember?

1221
01:34:10.417 --> 01:34:13.987
Do you know where
I can find this man?


1222
01:34:18.258 --> 01:34:20.260
Oh, yeah.

1223
01:34:20.293 --> 01:34:21.595
In fact,
we passed him early on,


1224
01:34:21.628 --> 01:34:24.731
at the snek
where we had pastechis.


1225
01:34:27.868 --> 01:34:29.070
What do you want him for?

1226
01:34:30.303 --> 01:34:31.972
Just take me to him.

1227
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.333
Hey, hey!

1228
01:35:00.367 --> 01:35:01.368
What's wrong with you, woman?

1229
01:35:01.401 --> 01:35:03.303
You... you cannot knock Chamon

1230
01:35:03.336 --> 01:35:04.538
off his chair like that.

1231
01:35:04.571 --> 01:35:06.040
What's wrong with you?

1232
01:35:06.074 --> 01:35:08.875
Man, it was nothing.
Scarcely noticed.


1233
01:35:08.909 --> 01:35:11.211
That... that is crazy.
That is...


1234
01:35:11.244 --> 01:35:12.779
that is really crazy.

1235
01:35:12.813 --> 01:35:17.151
<i>My</i> wife almost knocks
you off your chair.


1236
01:35:17.185 --> 01:35:19.053
You say "it's nothing"?

1237
01:35:19.087 --> 01:35:20.454
It happens.

1238
01:35:20.487 --> 01:35:22.622
Nora is always
very careful with us.


1239
01:35:22.656 --> 01:35:24.825
Were you feeling up my wife?

1240
01:35:24.858 --> 01:35:26.793
"Feeling up."

1241
01:35:26.827 --> 01:35:29.229
I haven't heard that
in a long time.


1242
01:35:29.262 --> 01:35:31.132
Man, I used to remember
when you used to sit next


1243
01:35:31.165 --> 01:35:32.899
to the girls on the bus.

1244
01:35:32.933 --> 01:35:36.137
You let your hand
just rest so on her thigh,


1245
01:35:36.170 --> 01:35:38.206
and you'd wait...
nice and innocent.


1246
01:35:38.238 --> 01:35:40.474
And if she moved the leg away,

1247
01:35:40.507 --> 01:35:44.678
you end up just staring up
at the empty air.


1248
01:35:44.711 --> 01:35:46.813
But if she moved it just so,

1249
01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:50.550
your finger get closer
and closer and...


1250
01:35:50.584 --> 01:35:52.719
Hey!

1251
01:35:52.753 --> 01:35:54.755
Are we here to play a game

1252
01:35:54.788 --> 01:35:57.158
or to behave like
horny teenagers?


1253
01:35:57.191 --> 01:35:59.026
So you never feel up the girls,
friend Manchi?


1254
01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:00.360
Of course, I did.

1255
01:36:00.393 --> 01:36:02.029
As a boy.

1256
01:36:02.063 --> 01:36:03.930
But I am a man,
and so are you.


1257
01:36:05.932 --> 01:36:07.901
Chamon.

1258
01:36:07.934 --> 01:36:09.503
I'm talking to you.

1259
01:36:10.771 --> 01:36:12.773
- Were you feeling up my wife?
- Bubu!


1260
01:36:12.806 --> 01:36:14.208
Don't be a damn fool.

1261
01:36:14.242 --> 01:36:15.776
You're imagining things.

1262
01:36:15.809 --> 01:36:18.045
You think I'm a blind man?

1263
01:36:18.079 --> 01:36:20.014
Don't you?
Heh, don't you?


1264
01:36:20.047 --> 01:36:22.349
Oh, come on, let's play.
Play!


1265
01:36:22.382 --> 01:36:23.884
Tell me, Manchi,
what would you do


1266
01:36:23.917 --> 01:36:25.719
if someone...

1267
01:36:25.752 --> 01:36:28.955
felt up Solema?

1268
01:36:28.989 --> 01:36:31.458
Only animals feel up
other men's wives.


1269
01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:35.129
Can we play now?

1270
01:36:37.664 --> 01:36:40.767
And you, Chamon, play, hm?

1271
01:36:54.447 --> 01:36:55.715
Changa!

1272
01:36:57.251 --> 01:36:59.753
<i>"Changa," or "double play,"</i>

1273
01:36:59.786 --> 01:37:03.124
<i>is when one is in a position
to place his last domino</i>


1274
01:37:03.157 --> 01:37:05.725
<i>at either end of the snake.</i>

1275
01:37:05.759 --> 01:37:08.229
<i>It gives that team
double points.</i>


1276
01:37:08.262 --> 01:37:09.763
All right, all right.

1277
01:37:09.796 --> 01:37:11.932
You can help yourselves.

1278
01:37:11.965 --> 01:37:14.168
I'm going out.

1279
01:37:14.202 --> 01:37:15.936
I don't even know how you can
sit here all day


1280
01:37:15.969 --> 01:37:17.470
and never even go
to the toilet.


1281
01:37:17.504 --> 01:37:18.839
Where you going?

1282
01:37:18.872 --> 01:37:20.807
I have to give my condolences.

1283
01:37:20.841 --> 01:37:22.909
Condolences?
Who died?


1284
01:37:22.943 --> 01:37:24.644
A woman from church.

1285
01:37:26.713 --> 01:37:28.782
Pshh.

1286
01:37:28.815 --> 01:37:31.852
That woman is crazy.

1287
01:37:43.730 --> 01:37:45.132
Play now, Manchi.

1288
01:37:45.166 --> 01:37:47.201
Hey, don't badger him.

1289
01:37:47.235 --> 01:37:49.170
Let the man take his time.

1290
01:37:49.203 --> 01:37:51.005
Why?
He has both the doubles.


1291
01:37:51.038 --> 01:37:52.839
He have a double-one
and a double-three.


1292
01:37:52.873 --> 01:37:55.542
I don't know why it's taking him
so long to think.


1293
01:37:58.478 --> 01:38:01.848
So this is
the corpus deliciti?


1294
01:38:01.882 --> 01:38:03.317
Stop joking around, Manchi.
Come on.


1295
01:38:03.351 --> 01:38:06.653
The sentence must always

1296
01:38:06.686 --> 01:38:08.122
be carefully prepared.

1297
01:38:08.155 --> 01:38:09.656
There's nothing to prepare.

1298
01:38:09.689 --> 01:38:12.392
Get rid of one
of your double pieces, this...


1299
01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:20.533
Okay.

1300
01:38:22.103 --> 01:38:23.703
Ten-two.

1301
01:38:23.737 --> 01:38:27.008
Here we go again, eh?

1302
01:38:27.041 --> 01:38:29.243
- Good play.
- No, that was excellent play.


1303
01:38:29.277 --> 01:38:30.977
You're right.
I admit it.


1304
01:38:31.012 --> 01:38:33.080
It is a game worthy of me.

1305
01:38:33.114 --> 01:38:37.084
Oh, so you can hang
the shoes this time.


1306
01:38:37.118 --> 01:38:39.320
You know,
I've done it so much, man,


1307
01:38:39.353 --> 01:38:41.488
my arm is stiff.

1308
01:38:53.433 --> 01:38:54.734
Mm.

1309
01:38:55.936 --> 01:39:00.540
Once, I thought the double-six
looked like a bride.


1310
01:39:00.573 --> 01:39:03.810
And now, it looks
more like a midwife.


1311
01:39:04.577 --> 01:39:06.247
No.

1312
01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:07.914
Octopus.

1313
01:39:08.581 --> 01:39:10.117
All eyes.

1314
01:39:11.551 --> 01:39:15.022
You are saying
the strangest things


1315
01:39:15.056 --> 01:39:17.058
this afternoon, Manchi,
the strangest things.


1316
01:39:17.091 --> 01:39:19.193
The eyes
of the public here


1317
01:39:19.226 --> 01:39:22.462
are simply driving me crazy,
Mr. Prosecutor.


1318
01:39:22.495 --> 01:39:25.799
You know, no one
needs to go crazy here.


1319
01:39:25.832 --> 01:39:27.968
We're just...

1320
01:39:28.601 --> 01:39:30.137
We're just playing
dominoes, no?


1321
01:39:30.171 --> 01:39:32.440
Crazy isn't the right word, mm.

1322
01:39:36.177 --> 01:39:37.978
They're just so pushy.

1323
01:39:39.612 --> 01:39:41.415
Those eyes...

1324
01:39:41.449 --> 01:39:42.582
pushy!

1325
01:39:42.615 --> 01:39:44.884
Man, I think this,
uh, defeat


1326
01:39:44.918 --> 01:39:46.387
is getting to you bit, eh?

1327
01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:49.323
Ah, Bubu, we cannot lose

1328
01:39:49.357 --> 01:39:52.126
because there's nothing to lose.

1329
01:39:53.526 --> 01:39:55.495
And don't forget...

1330
01:39:55.528 --> 01:39:57.831
it's only a game
of dominoes, eh?


1331
01:40:01.168 --> 01:40:04.305
<i>Ernesto realized
that the revenge he wanted</i>


1332
01:40:04.338 --> 01:40:07.408
<i>to take on Manchi
was succeeding.</i>


1333
01:40:52.552 --> 01:40:55.789
<i>He could well
have murdered the guy,</i>


1334
01:40:55.822 --> 01:40:57.924
<i>but this was much better.</i>

1335
01:41:06.267 --> 01:41:08.735
You all heard my wife;
she just said


1336
01:41:08.768 --> 01:41:10.970
that she was going to give
someone her condolences.


1337
01:41:11.005 --> 01:41:12.440
Now look, look... hey.

1338
01:41:18.512 --> 01:41:20.081
Now she's going
into Manchi's house.


1339
01:41:20.114 --> 01:41:21.415
She never does that.

1340
01:41:21.449 --> 01:41:25.286
She has been acting strange
all day.


1341
01:41:28.355 --> 01:41:29.622
All day.

1342
01:41:37.098 --> 01:41:39.766
Nora, tell me what's wrong.

1343
01:41:42.269 --> 01:41:43.903
It's Ostrik.

1344
01:41:44.804 --> 01:41:47.274
He needs shoes for school.

1345
01:41:48.442 --> 01:41:50.177
Well, how much do you need?

1346
01:41:51.412 --> 01:41:52.712
Five guilders.

1347
01:41:52.745 --> 01:41:54.515
Only five guilders?

1348
01:41:57.551 --> 01:41:59.253
One moment.

1349
01:42:01.589 --> 01:42:04.924
I'll get it back to you as soon
as I get some money from Bubu.


1350
01:42:07.061 --> 01:42:10.030
Oh, I... I filled the car
this morning.


1351
01:42:10.064 --> 01:42:11.298
I'm sorry.

1352
01:42:11.332 --> 01:42:13.400
I'll have the money
for you tomorrow.


1353
01:42:13.434 --> 01:42:14.968
Sorry.

1354
01:42:15.002 --> 01:42:17.271
- I should not have come.
- Oh!


1355
01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:22.876
God sent you.

1356
01:42:25.412 --> 01:42:26.547
Wait.

1357
01:42:36.490 --> 01:42:38.292
Here, Nora.

1358
01:42:38.325 --> 01:42:39.560
Here.

1359
01:42:42.496 --> 01:42:43.963
Thank you, Nora.

1360
01:42:43.998 --> 01:42:45.765
Thank you.
Thank you.


1361
01:43:02.483 --> 01:43:04.251
It's a bloodbath.

1362
01:43:04.285 --> 01:43:06.287
The worst beating
in domino history.


1363
01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:08.189
- Are they still losing?
- Yeah!


1364
01:43:08.222 --> 01:43:11.958
All this because Bubu spent
the whole night in Campo.


1365
01:43:11.992 --> 01:43:14.395
That's a lie, you idiot!

1366
01:43:15.462 --> 01:43:18.032
Can't start the union meeting
until the game is over.


1367
01:43:18.065 --> 01:43:21.035
But how can we elect a loser?

1368
01:43:21.068 --> 01:43:22.869
How dare you!

1369
01:43:22.902 --> 01:43:26.106
Bubu Fiel is not a loser.

1370
01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:28.475
I am the wife of Bubu Fiel.

1371
01:43:28.509 --> 01:43:30.977
Welcome to our home.

1372
01:43:31.011 --> 01:43:32.379
Who would like a drink?

1373
01:44:04.545 --> 01:44:05.912
Shon.

1374
01:44:07.381 --> 01:44:09.516
I hope you know
what you're doing.


1375
01:44:09.550 --> 01:44:12.319
Ask yourself,
is it worth it?


1376
01:44:57.231 --> 01:44:58.831
You want something?

1377
01:45:00.967 --> 01:45:02.636
I want to play dominoes.

1378
01:45:02.670 --> 01:45:05.306
Dominoes is a very
dangerous game.


1379
01:45:06.273 --> 01:45:08.242
And I don't play anymore.

1380
01:45:08.275 --> 01:45:10.044
I don't play either.

1381
01:45:12.613 --> 01:45:15.049
But I think you will
want to play me.


1382
01:45:29.029 --> 01:45:31.999
You know, it's ridiculous
to play with two people.


1383
01:45:32.032 --> 01:45:33.833
This is a special game.

1384
01:45:33.866 --> 01:45:35.703
Different rules apply.

1385
01:45:37.204 --> 01:45:38.639
Hm.

1386
01:45:55.955 --> 01:45:57.990
So, what is it you want?

1387
01:45:58.625 --> 01:46:00.361
Mm!

1388
01:46:06.066 --> 01:46:08.635
I believe, um,
you're Bubu Fiel?


1389
01:46:08.669 --> 01:46:11.338
Yeah......
but don't disturb me right now.


1390
01:46:11.372 --> 01:46:12.673
I am... I am busy.

1391
01:46:12.706 --> 01:46:14.608
- Okay, Charles Samuel.
- Mm-hmm.


1392
01:46:14.641 --> 01:46:16.143
I came to cover
the union meeting,


1393
01:46:16.176 --> 01:46:17.678
but this is even better.

1394
01:46:17.711 --> 01:46:19.313
This must be the first nine-love

1395
01:46:19.346 --> 01:46:21.648
in the history of Curaçao.

1396
01:46:21.682 --> 01:46:23.784
- Uh-huh.
- Are you going to forfeit?


1397
01:46:23.817 --> 01:46:25.819
Forfeit?
No, no, no, no, no.


1398
01:46:25.853 --> 01:46:27.887
We always finish the game.

1399
01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:30.224
- We're fighting back, eh, Manchi?
- Uh-huh.


1400
01:46:30.257 --> 01:46:31.825
And what are you going to do
when you become


1401
01:46:31.859 --> 01:46:33.994
president of the union?

1402
01:46:36.497 --> 01:46:37.897
Oh, uh...

1403
01:46:37.930 --> 01:46:39.299
I...

1404
01:46:39.333 --> 01:46:41.001
we need, uh, a revolution.

1405
01:46:41.034 --> 01:46:43.103
- A revolution?
- Yeah.


1406
01:46:44.104 --> 01:46:46.707
This island is, um, is corrupt.

1407
01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:48.842
The politicians
are screwing us.


1408
01:46:48.876 --> 01:46:50.811
They're inviting
the foreigners to be in on it.


1409
01:46:50.844 --> 01:46:53.580
So we, you know,
the people,


1410
01:46:53.614 --> 01:46:56.483
will not take it any longer.

1411
01:46:57.851 --> 01:47:00.120
And what are you going
to do about it?


1412
01:47:00.554 --> 01:47:01.988
I...

1413
01:47:02.022 --> 01:47:03.524
the... the prices.

1414
01:47:03.557 --> 01:47:07.060
Prices... the prices are...
are high.


1415
01:47:07.094 --> 01:47:10.030
They need to come down.

1416
01:47:10.063 --> 01:47:11.598
The price of taxis?

1417
01:47:11.632 --> 01:47:13.200
Taxis?
Don't be a damn fool.


1418
01:47:13.233 --> 01:47:14.401
Eh?

1419
01:47:14.435 --> 01:47:16.170
No, the prices.

1420
01:47:16.203 --> 01:47:19.773
Food, drink, gasoline.

1421
01:47:19.807 --> 01:47:22.543
Building supplies, paint.

1422
01:47:22.576 --> 01:47:25.245
- Eh? You know...
- Louder, louder!


1423
01:47:30.083 --> 01:47:32.453
Go on, Bubu,
tell it to the people!


1424
01:47:35.055 --> 01:47:37.090
For the revolution!

1425
01:47:43.096 --> 01:47:47.534
The government
of this island, eh,


1426
01:47:47.568 --> 01:47:51.405
- does nothing to curb imports!
- Nothing!


1427
01:47:51.438 --> 01:47:55.975
The government does nothing, eh,
to encourage export.


1428
01:47:56.009 --> 01:48:00.380
The government does nothing
to make sure that every child


1429
01:48:00.414 --> 01:48:03.250
on this island has
a decent pair of shoes!


1430
01:48:03.283 --> 01:48:05.819
- Bubu!
- Long live the revolution!


1431
01:48:05.853 --> 01:48:07.955
Yeah!

1432
01:48:07.987 --> 01:48:11.859
Bubu, Bubu, Bubu, Bubu, Bubu!

1433
01:48:14.528 --> 01:48:17.397
Hey, give my comrades here
some drinks, eh?


1434
01:48:19.867 --> 01:48:21.735
From me to you!

1435
01:48:31.211 --> 01:48:33.313
Ostrik.
Come, come.


1436
01:48:35.649 --> 01:48:37.084
I want you to take this,

1437
01:48:37.117 --> 01:48:38.752
go to the shop,

1438
01:48:38.785 --> 01:48:41.088
and buy one gallon of rum.

1439
01:48:41.121 --> 01:48:42.422
What?

1440
01:48:42.456 --> 01:48:44.091
Off you go.

1441
01:48:44.124 --> 01:48:45.192
Rum?

1442
01:48:45.225 --> 01:48:47.794
You want me to buy rum?

1443
01:48:47.828 --> 01:48:50.097
You cannot do that.
Those are for my shoes!


1444
01:48:50.130 --> 01:48:51.431
Ostrik!

1445
01:48:51.465 --> 01:48:53.300
Do you want your father
to lose face


1446
01:48:53.333 --> 01:48:54.801
in front of all these people?

1447
01:48:54.835 --> 01:48:56.370
And on TV?

1448
01:48:56.403 --> 01:48:59.306
He's going to be
the new president.


1449
01:48:59.339 --> 01:49:01.009
Aren't you proud of your father?

1450
01:49:01.041 --> 01:49:02.676
Don't worry.

1451
01:49:02.709 --> 01:49:04.545
We'll get your shoes later.

1452
01:49:05.679 --> 01:49:07.514
Now do as your mother says.

1453
01:49:57.397 --> 01:50:00.267
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay.


1454
01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:02.869
So, I want to thank
you all for coming.


1455
01:50:02.903 --> 01:50:04.738
The meeting will begin
in about ten minutes.


1456
01:50:04.771 --> 01:50:06.206
Right.

1457
01:50:06.239 --> 01:50:07.774
I'll be back
in a moment, so...


1458
01:50:07.808 --> 01:50:11.511
the dam is about to burst,

1459
01:50:11.545 --> 01:50:12.879
flood the valley.

1460
01:50:16.084 --> 01:50:17.818
Mmmwah!

1461
01:50:19.152 --> 01:50:20.420
Thank you all.

1462
01:50:20.454 --> 01:50:22.956
Eh, eh, eh... ah!

1463
01:52:05.859 --> 01:52:08.495
You're a first-class
piece of shit.


1464
01:52:08.528 --> 01:52:09.896
You wouldn't talk
to me all day.


1465
01:52:09.930 --> 01:52:12.133
- You wouldn't even look at me!
- Hey.


1466
01:52:12.166 --> 01:52:13.900
What did you expect?

1467
01:52:13.934 --> 01:52:15.136
Bubu is right there.

1468
01:52:15.169 --> 01:52:16.837
Chamon, I'm desperate.

1469
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:20.041
- I need you to help me.
- No, no, no, no, no.


1470
01:52:20.074 --> 01:52:22.876
I cannot do that anymore.

1471
01:52:22.909 --> 01:52:24.511
What is it, Chamon?

1472
01:52:24.544 --> 01:52:26.713
You don't like me anymore,
is that it?


1473
01:52:28.248 --> 01:52:31.251
You don't like fucking me?

1474
01:52:33.687 --> 01:52:35.989
- You know I like it.
- Mm.


1475
01:52:36.023 --> 01:52:38.759
I wish I didn't like it,
but I love it.


1476
01:52:40.027 --> 01:52:41.895
But you know, with you...

1477
01:52:41.928 --> 01:52:43.830
it is only about the money.

1478
01:52:43.864 --> 01:52:44.831
All the time.

1479
01:52:44.865 --> 01:52:47.334
"Chamon, give me some money."

1480
01:52:47.367 --> 01:52:51.538
And so it goes,
over and over and over.


1481
01:52:51.571 --> 01:52:54.541
You are the insatiable whore.

1482
01:52:54.574 --> 01:52:56.843
And you know, I'm beginning
to think that you like my dick


1483
01:52:56.877 --> 01:52:58.845
more than you like my money!

1484
01:52:58.879 --> 01:53:02.783
Did you think that I came
to you for my pleasure?


1485
01:53:02.816 --> 01:53:05.886
Uh-huh.

1486
01:53:05.919 --> 01:53:10.390
Did you think that if I <i>only</i>
wanted to go to bed with a man,


1487
01:53:10.423 --> 01:53:12.793
I would have chosen an ugly

1488
01:53:12.826 --> 01:53:15.695
Windward Islander like you?

1489
01:53:17.265 --> 01:53:20.300
Did you think that
one dick isn't enough for me,


1490
01:53:20.333 --> 01:53:22.903
and that that was why
I needed your your dick,


1491
01:53:22.936 --> 01:53:25.705
your insignificant,
little dick?


1492
01:53:25.739 --> 01:53:27.141
Oh, no, Chamon.

1493
01:53:27.175 --> 01:53:30.310
I only needed one dick,
and no one else's.


1494
01:53:30.343 --> 01:53:32.879
And that is Bubu Fiel.

1495
01:53:32.913 --> 01:53:35.782
Do you know that in all this
time I've gone to bed with you,


1496
01:53:35.816 --> 01:53:37.617
I've never come, not once?

1497
01:53:37.651 --> 01:53:38.952
Okay.

1498
01:53:38.985 --> 01:53:40.453
I've never had pleasure
with you.


1499
01:53:40.487 --> 01:53:41.755
Okay.

1500
01:53:41.788 --> 01:53:43.790
I never had pleasure
with anyone else,


1501
01:53:43.824 --> 01:53:47.494
but Bubu Fiel in my life.

1502
01:53:47.527 --> 01:53:49.997
You can't hold a candle
to him as a man.


1503
01:53:50.031 --> 01:53:52.399
And I wouldn't swap him
for another man,


1504
01:53:52.432 --> 01:53:54.168
not for a million guilders.

1505
01:53:54.202 --> 01:53:57.305
And certainly not for you.

1506
01:53:57.337 --> 01:54:00.640
I thought we understood
each other.


1507
01:54:00.674 --> 01:54:03.777
But you're a dirty,
filthy slob.


1508
01:54:03.810 --> 01:54:05.079
You're a bastard!

1509
01:54:05.112 --> 01:54:07.014
- You're a fucking liar.
- Hm.


1510
01:54:07.048 --> 01:54:09.649
And you're lying
because I know you loved it.


1511
01:54:09.683 --> 01:54:11.585
Never, never!

1512
01:54:11.618 --> 01:54:13.587
Never.
Not with you.


1513
01:54:16.057 --> 01:54:18.358
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
here, here, take it, take it.


1514
01:54:18.391 --> 01:54:19.359
- No.
- Take it.


1515
01:54:19.392 --> 01:54:20.360
- What?
- Here.


1516
01:54:20.393 --> 01:54:21.795
What do you think I am?

1517
01:54:21.828 --> 01:54:24.298
You filthy Windwarder
piece of shit.


1518
01:54:24.332 --> 01:54:26.200
I will call Bubu,

1519
01:54:26.234 --> 01:54:29.502
and he'll kick that
filthy money up your ass!


1520
01:54:29.536 --> 01:54:31.838
- Okay.
- Fuck you.


1521
01:54:46.519 --> 01:54:47.787
Mm.

1522
01:54:48.655 --> 01:54:50.857
Hey, listen...

1523
01:54:54.895 --> 01:54:56.097
Amigo.

1524
01:55:02.569 --> 01:55:04.305
Hey, come on, now.

1525
01:55:10.443 --> 01:55:13.780
Chamon, you were
insulting my wife, hmm?


1526
01:55:15.515 --> 01:55:18.185
What did you call my wife?

1527
01:55:18.219 --> 01:55:20.021
- What did you call my wife?
- No.


1528
01:55:20.054 --> 01:55:21.855
- What did you call my wife?
- No.


1529
01:55:21.888 --> 01:55:23.357
- What did you call my wife?
- No, no.


1530
01:55:23.391 --> 01:55:24.858
- What did you call my wife?
- Bubu, stop.


1531
01:55:24.891 --> 01:55:26.327
- A whore?
- Bubu, no!


1532
01:55:29.230 --> 01:55:31.765
- No, this won't do you.
- Chamon, Chamon.


1533
01:55:31.798 --> 01:55:33.566
Please!
Please!


1534
01:55:49.250 --> 01:55:51.118
Chamon, Chamon, Chamon.

1535
01:55:56.257 --> 01:55:58.426
Okay.

1536
01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:21.015
Hey, hey.

1537
01:56:22.083 --> 01:56:23.317
I, um...

1538
01:56:23.351 --> 01:56:24.651
It's...

1539
01:56:28.189 --> 01:56:29.290
Look, here.

1540
01:56:31.025 --> 01:56:32.759
Here, you, um...

1541
01:56:32.792 --> 01:56:36.663
You take this... it is...
no, no, you take it.


1542
01:56:36.696 --> 01:56:38.631
It's for your shoes, yeah?

1543
01:56:41.801 --> 01:56:43.204
And I'm sorry.

1544
01:56:44.105 --> 01:56:45.638
I'm so sorry.

1545
01:56:57.018 --> 01:56:59.353
Bubu...

1546
01:57:07.461 --> 01:57:08.828
No!

1547
01:57:10.964 --> 01:57:12.333
You're dead.

1548
01:57:13.067 --> 01:57:14.834
Bubu, you're dead.

1549
01:57:17.138 --> 01:57:22.776
Bubu!

1550
01:58:32.146 --> 01:58:33.581
Give me rum.

1551
01:58:41.155 --> 01:58:42.456
Leave it.

1552
01:58:53.334 --> 01:58:55.102
Won't you call the police?

1553
01:58:56.303 --> 01:58:58.472
Tell them I'm here.

1554
01:58:58.506 --> 01:59:00.640
Tell them I just killed a man.

1555
01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:28.668
I played a game once.

1556
01:59:28.701 --> 01:59:31.005
It was the most terrible game
I ever played.


1557
01:59:31.038 --> 01:59:32.972
It was an appalling game,

1558
01:59:33.007 --> 01:59:36.343
and we were under the most
severe stress imaginable.


1559
01:59:38.646 --> 01:59:40.247
And that game...

1560
01:59:43.284 --> 01:59:45.752
that game ended in tragedy.

1561
01:59:45.785 --> 01:59:47.854
But no one, hear me,

1562
01:59:47.887 --> 01:59:50.357
no one was to blame.

1563
01:59:50.391 --> 01:59:52.593
How can nobody be to blame?

1564
01:59:54.295 --> 01:59:56.497
They all participated willingly.

1565
01:59:57.964 --> 01:59:59.633
Why didn't they stop the game?

1566
01:59:59.667 --> 02:00:02.303
Because that would not
have been possible.


1567
02:00:02.336 --> 02:00:06.006
The game... and the game
demanded an end.


1568
02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:08.942
Whatever the consequences
of that entails...


1569
02:00:12.580 --> 02:00:14.448
You know, if anything...

1570
02:00:16.584 --> 02:00:19.286
it was our poverty
that was to blame.


1571
02:00:22.223 --> 02:00:26.126
Do you think the players
deserved punishment?


1572
02:00:27.595 --> 02:00:29.430
Is that what you are here for?

1573
02:00:30.763 --> 02:00:33.300
You here to
mete out punishment?


1574
02:00:41.575 --> 02:00:44.978
I respected your father

1575
02:00:45.012 --> 02:00:46.647
very much.

1576
02:00:48.015 --> 02:00:52.152
A day has not passed that
I don't regret what happened.


1577
02:01:12.106 --> 02:01:13.507
Match.

1578
02:01:14.308 --> 02:01:16.610
What it was
we were playing for?


1579
02:01:57.984 --> 02:01:59.553
Bubu...

1580
02:02:15.369 --> 02:02:18.905
I am so sorry, Vera.

1581
02:02:21.675 --> 02:02:23.344
For everything.

1582
02:02:23.377 --> 02:02:24.944
For not being there,

1583
02:02:24.977 --> 02:02:26.580
for being so selfish.

1584
02:02:28.716 --> 02:02:30.484
I'm so sorry.

1585
02:02:41.395 --> 02:02:45.399
I always knew
you would become a doctor.


1586
02:02:48.968 --> 02:02:51.105
Doesn't he look well?

1587
02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:54.375
Yes.

1588
02:02:54.408 --> 02:02:56.210
Yes, he does.

1589
02:02:58.011 --> 02:03:00.447
I knew it was you, Ostrik.

1590
02:03:00.481 --> 02:03:02.383
Yes.

1591
02:03:02.416 --> 02:03:05.519
Yes, of course I knew.

1592
02:03:11.859 --> 02:03:15.329
I forgot what
I was going to say.


1593
02:03:15.362 --> 02:03:18.365
I'm getting
so forgetful lately.


1594
02:03:22.202 --> 02:03:23.970
Please forgive me.

1595
02:03:32.513 --> 02:03:34.848
There is nothing to forgive,
Mama.


1596
02:03:34.882 --> 02:03:36.116
Mm.

1597
02:03:42.222 --> 02:03:43.490
Mm.

1598
02:04:12.853 --> 02:04:15.289
<i>They still talk
about my father.</i>


1599
02:04:15.322 --> 02:04:16.690
<i>They tell me:</i>

1600
02:04:16.723 --> 02:04:19.193
<i>"Your father was
the best president</i>


1601
02:04:19.226 --> 02:04:21.628
<i>the union ever had!"</i>

1602
02:04:21.662 --> 02:04:23.963
<i>"And so he was," I said,</i>

1603
02:04:23.997 --> 02:04:26.467
<i>"but only for one day."</i>

1604
02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:30.771
<i>And everyone still has a
relatively hard time of it here.</i>


1605
02:04:30.804 --> 02:04:33.040
<i>Especially women.</i>

1606
02:04:33.073 --> 02:04:34.974
<i>That is why I hope</i>

1607
02:04:35.008 --> 02:04:38.345
<i>Solema's endeavors
are successful.</i>


1608
02:04:38.378 --> 02:04:39.947
<i>More co-operatives,</i>

1609
02:04:39.979 --> 02:04:42.316
<i>united into
a political movement,</i>


1610
02:04:42.349 --> 02:04:44.651
<i>based on the ideals
of the community</i>


1611
02:04:44.685 --> 02:04:46.720
