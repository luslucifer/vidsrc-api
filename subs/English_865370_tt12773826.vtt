<i>Close your eyes.</i>

3
00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:36.543
<i>Clear your mind.</i>

4
00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:43.208
<i>Imagine a place
that comforts you,</i>


5
00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:45.275
<i>brings you joy.</i>

6
00:00:49.876 --> 00:00:53.409
<i>Our meditation begins now.</i>

7
00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.510
<i>Breathe in for
four seconds.</i>


8
00:01:07.011 --> 00:01:10.442
<i>Hold your
breath for seven seconds.</i>


9
00:01:14.376 --> 00:01:18.577
<i>Now breathe out
for eight seconds.</i>


10
00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:28.277
<i>Feel yourself
calming down,</i>


11
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.678
<i>feeling relaxed.</i>

12
00:02:03.612 --> 00:02:05.178
I'm ready.

13
00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:08.712
<i>You wait until I'm ready.</i>

14
00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:11.013
Of course.

15
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.178
<i>Everything to your liking?</i>

16
00:02:14.946 --> 00:02:16.312
No.

17
00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:17.680
Oh.

18
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.014
Oh.

19
00:02:38.648 --> 00:02:40.346
<i>You're a nasty,</i>

20
00:02:40.481 --> 00:02:41.748
dirty,

21
00:02:42.146 --> 00:02:43.614
<i>ugly...</i>

22
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:45.848
Boy.

23
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.047
Pineapple!

24
00:02:50.313 --> 00:02:51.748
Too rough?

25
00:03:13.615 --> 00:03:15.281
Cutting it short.

26
00:03:16.048 --> 00:03:17.882
Like the hatbox?

27
00:03:18.016 --> 00:03:19.148
Black market, baby.

28
00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:20.682
I got a whole
trunk full of 'em.


29
00:03:21.515 --> 00:03:23.349
What?

30
00:03:23.483 --> 00:03:25.215
Well, it's my thing.

31
00:03:26.016 --> 00:03:27.383
You didn't know
it was my thing?


32
00:03:27.516 --> 00:03:29.048
I just thought that my
reputation preceded me.


33
00:03:29.181 --> 00:03:30.683
Some of it.

34
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:33.349
That's what I thought.

35
00:03:33.483 --> 00:03:35.550
<i>116-12, copy 506.</i>

36
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.850
<i>I got the same one.</i>

37
00:03:37.983 --> 00:03:39.282
Then you don't have
to touch it, do you?


38
00:03:39.416 --> 00:03:41.583
Whoa, you need to
chill, old man.


39
00:03:41.716 --> 00:03:44.750
What is the point if
we can't have a laugh?


40
00:03:44.883 --> 00:03:46.550
Point is to do the job.

41
00:03:47.316 --> 00:03:49.283
And a huge paycheque,
am I right?


42
00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.584
Let's get the gear.

43
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.216
Sure. Let's.

44
00:04:11.717 --> 00:04:12.684
Take this.

45
00:04:12.817 --> 00:04:14.518
Ah, good.

46
00:04:14.652 --> 00:04:15.385
Phew.

47
00:04:15.518 --> 00:04:17.418
You think I'm ugly, really?

48
00:04:17.552 --> 00:04:18.884
Shut up.

49
00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:20.217
<i>Better?</i>

50
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:21.919
Yeah, feels better.

51
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.250
<i>Like I care,
you pig.</i>


52
00:04:25.051 --> 00:04:26.084
It's coming back.

53
00:04:26.217 --> 00:04:27.718
Come on.

54
00:04:29.518 --> 00:04:31.752
Could you try some
Russian accent?


55
00:04:32.418 --> 00:04:34.618
<i>Like, you know,</i>

56
00:04:34.752 --> 00:04:36.785
Russian accent, okay?

57
00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.818
Don't
tell me what to do!


58
00:04:39.952 --> 00:04:40.952
That's not-

59
00:04:41.084 --> 00:04:42.619
not 100% but is good,

60
00:04:42.753 --> 00:04:43.619
just come on!

61
00:04:43.753 --> 00:04:46.218
Shut your big fat yap.

62
00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:47.886
Okay, okay.

63
00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.719
What?

64
00:05:00.753 --> 00:05:01.819
What's that?

65
00:05:10.754 --> 00:05:12.520
<i>Oslo, we found you.</i>

66
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.987
<i>Go, hide.</i>

67
00:05:18.254 --> 00:05:19.854
Oslo, you fat fuck!

68
00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:21.354
No!

69
00:05:25.021 --> 00:05:26.588
<i>What the fuck, man?</i>

70
00:05:29.421 --> 00:05:31.987
<i>Finished
before you finished.</i>


71
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.788
You know, he was uh-

72
00:05:34.621 --> 00:05:35.755
The man is dead.

73
00:05:35.888 --> 00:05:37.388
How 'bout a little tact?

74
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.488
Who cares?

75
00:05:39.621 --> 00:05:40.655
Not him.

76
00:06:09.155 --> 00:06:10.055
One, two.

77
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.490
I got this blade
for a steal.


78
00:06:22.456 --> 00:06:24.223
Glides like a dream.

79
00:06:24.657 --> 00:06:26.557
Home Smart Tools
and Fixtures.


80
00:06:48.056 --> 00:06:49.591
Come on.

81
00:06:51.991 --> 00:06:54.257
<i>All right,
help me roll him over.</i>


82
00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:08.191
<i>Oslo, you kinky fucker.</i>

83
00:07:29.393 --> 00:07:30.091
<i>Get her!</i>

84
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.091
Goddammit.

85
00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:41.626
Did ya get her?

86
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.192
<i>No,
I actually didn't shoot her</i>


87
00:07:43.326 --> 00:07:44.826
<i>in a hallway full
of people, okay?</i>


88
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.493
<i>Shit.</i>

89
00:07:51.093 --> 00:07:52.494
<i>What are you doing, man?</i>

90
00:07:52.626 --> 00:07:54.360
- Can you help out?
- <i>Are you crazy?</i>


91
00:07:54.494 --> 00:07:56.059
Come on!

92
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.059
You're supposed to be alone.

93
00:08:02.327 --> 00:08:03.794
There's nothing yet.
We gotta move.


94
00:08:03.928 --> 00:08:05.294
Problem solved.

95
00:08:05.427 --> 00:08:07.128
<i>Peyton Sallow.</i>

96
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.894
7045 Curtis Street.

97
00:08:11.028 --> 00:08:13.128
Unit 403, go get her.

98
00:08:13.261 --> 00:08:14.128
What?

99
00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:15.328
Go get her.

100
00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:17.395
Like chop her
fucking head off.


101
00:08:20.928 --> 00:08:22.662
You can shoot a girl.

102
00:08:23.928 --> 00:08:25.061
That's equality.

103
00:08:25.194 --> 00:08:26.528
I'd do it but I'd
rather do this.


104
00:08:26.662 --> 00:08:28.194
Besides, it's your
fucking fault!


105
00:08:28.328 --> 00:08:29.662
I'll do it.

106
00:08:29.795 --> 00:08:31.395
I don't really hear
your enthusiasm.


107
00:08:31.528 --> 00:08:33.095
I got it!

108
00:08:33.762 --> 00:08:35.461
That's better.

109
00:09:10.297 --> 00:09:11.597
- Hi.
- What's goin' on?


110
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.530
- Let me in.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.


111
00:09:14.063 --> 00:09:15.196
What's goin' on?

112
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.530
I just need a
place to crash.


113
00:09:17.664 --> 00:09:18.697
Look at me.

114
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:19.864
<i>Who's it at this hour?</i>

115
00:09:19.997 --> 00:09:20.830
Bad things are happening.

116
00:09:20.964 --> 00:09:23.064
Aw, dammit, woman.

117
00:09:23.964 --> 00:09:26.197
Uh, um, uh-

118
00:09:26.331 --> 00:09:28.064
Who are you?

119
00:09:28.697 --> 00:09:29.998
Mike's friend.

120
00:09:30.331 --> 00:09:31.498
That-that, um, that thing-

121
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.897
Mike doesn't have
friends like you.


122
00:09:33.032 --> 00:09:34.197
From, uh, from
the other day.


123
00:09:34.331 --> 00:09:35.631
I'm callin' the police.

124
00:09:35.764 --> 00:09:38.197
She-she, uh, she's the
girl from upstairs, Mom.


125
00:09:38.331 --> 00:09:40.097
Please-please don't.

126
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:42.731
Shit, hold on a sec.

127
00:09:44.364 --> 00:09:46.098
Here, you know what?

128
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:47.565
Take this.

129
00:09:47.698 --> 00:09:48.565
What?

130
00:09:48.698 --> 00:09:50.665
Stay warm, okay?

131
00:09:50.798 --> 00:09:54.065
And I will call you,
I promise.


132
00:09:54.198 --> 00:09:55.698
Oh, fuck your scarf!

133
00:09:55.831 --> 00:09:57.999
<i>Don't you
give her your scarf!</i>


134
00:09:58.132 --> 00:09:58.999
Oh, Mom.

135
00:09:59.132 --> 00:10:00.132
It's a beautiful scarf.

136
00:10:00.265 --> 00:10:01.399
It will keep you warm.

137
00:10:01.532 --> 00:10:02.832
Mike, but I really need-
- I'm sorry.


138
00:10:03.632 --> 00:10:05.232
But I really
need to come in!


139
00:10:28.567 --> 00:10:30.500
It's a cold night, huh?

140
00:10:31.733 --> 00:10:33.035
Mmm hmm.

141
00:10:44.367 --> 00:10:45.301
Don't move.

142
00:10:53.936 --> 00:10:55.501
What-what, just-

143
00:10:58.901 --> 00:11:00.467
Oh, crap.

144
00:11:09.768 --> 00:11:11.268
Jesus.

145
00:11:12.902 --> 00:11:14.435
What are you doin' here?

146
00:11:15.101 --> 00:11:18.201
I heard about a hooker in
leather on the cop box, so.


147
00:11:18.569 --> 00:11:20.635
What can I say?
I got paranoid.


148
00:11:22.037 --> 00:11:23.735
Sweet score.

149
00:11:25.468 --> 00:11:26.869
<i>All right, let's get
her ready for Reggie's.</i>


150
00:11:27.003 --> 00:11:28.069
I got room.

151
00:11:28.202 --> 00:11:29.602
No, I'm not done.

152
00:11:29.735 --> 00:11:30.970
Man, I am two for two tonight.
Let me get my saw.


153
00:11:31.102 --> 00:11:32.735
Forgot about her.

154
00:11:33.903 --> 00:11:38.736
There's a guy up there
and he spoke to her and,


155
00:11:38.869 --> 00:11:40.903
I just don't know
what she said to him.


156
00:11:41.037 --> 00:11:42.670
So I gotta deal with that.

157
00:11:42.803 --> 00:11:44.303
I got it, don't worry.

158
00:11:46.436 --> 00:11:48.803
You mean the loser with
the cock-blocking mom?


159
00:11:50.303 --> 00:11:51.603
These cops,
they got some zingers.


160
00:11:51.736 --> 00:11:53.603
Yeah, they're
not comin' here.


161
00:11:53.736 --> 00:11:55.670
<i>That wacko lady
she calls 'em a lot.</i>


162
00:11:55.803 --> 00:11:56.836
Okay.

163
00:11:56.971 --> 00:11:58.103
But you never
can be too sure.


164
00:11:58.237 --> 00:11:59.470
Yeah, I said I'd
take care of it.


165
00:11:59.604 --> 00:12:01.137
I think I'll
fit two heads.


166
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.170
Do you hear what I'm
saying you psycho fuck?


167
00:12:12.005 --> 00:12:14.537
Relax.

168
00:12:14.671 --> 00:12:16.838
It's a joke.

169
00:12:29.972 --> 00:12:30.972
I'll get you back.

170
00:12:31.138 --> 00:12:32.238
Where you going?

171
00:12:32.371 --> 00:12:34.338
Kill those witness
fucks in 308.


172
00:12:38.973 --> 00:12:40.738
See ya at Reggie's.

173
00:13:52.608 --> 00:13:54.675
<i>Whew!</i>

174
00:13:55.541 --> 00:13:56.575
I gotta tell you, man,

175
00:13:56.708 --> 00:13:58.075
I was shocked to
hear from you,


176
00:13:58.208 --> 00:14:00.375
you know, out here.

177
00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:01.542
Yeah.

178
00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:03.909
Well, things didn't
go as planned.


179
00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:05.409
<i>Yeah, clearly.</i>

180
00:14:05.542 --> 00:14:07.609
God, getting dinged
up on your last gig?


181
00:14:07.743 --> 00:14:09.910
<i>That-that-that is
some luck, man.</i>


182
00:14:10.043 --> 00:14:11.910
I don't
believe in luck.


183
00:14:12.043 --> 00:14:13.108
As you shouldn't.

184
00:14:13.242 --> 00:14:15.076
Okay, now look,
I got here,


185
00:14:15.208 --> 00:14:17.044
address is on the key,

186
00:14:17.176 --> 00:14:18.576
<i>burner phone,</i>

187
00:14:18.709 --> 00:14:20.044
<i>you're good.</i>

188
00:14:20.343 --> 00:14:22.109
- Listen.
- <i>Yeah?</i>


189
00:14:22.777 --> 00:14:23.944
I need a few things.

190
00:14:24.076 --> 00:14:25.944
Oh yeah, some favours?

191
00:14:26.076 --> 00:14:27.343
When do you do a favour?

192
00:14:27.476 --> 00:14:29.209
<i>No, you're right,
never, never.</i>


193
00:14:29.343 --> 00:14:30.944
It's an integral part
of my business model.


194
00:14:31.076 --> 00:14:32.076
<i>Yeah, well,</i>

195
00:14:32.209 --> 00:14:33.944
I need a new passport.

196
00:14:34.076 --> 00:14:35.543
Mmm hmm.

197
00:14:35.778 --> 00:14:37.276
Or maybe two.

198
00:14:37.844 --> 00:14:39.711
<i>Two? Why?</i>

199
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:46.945
<i>What the holy hell, man?</i>

200
00:14:47.077 --> 00:14:49.643
What, what is that?

201
00:14:49.778 --> 00:14:50.643
It's a-it's a witness.

202
00:14:50.778 --> 00:14:51.643
A witness?

203
00:14:51.778 --> 00:14:52.444
Yeah.

204
00:14:52.578 --> 00:14:53.644
<i>Well, get rid of it!</i>

205
00:14:53.778 --> 00:14:54.844
<i>Come on, it could-</i>

206
00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:56.311
it could be listening
to my voice right,


207
00:14:56.444 --> 00:14:57.311
<i>it's hearing my
voice right now!</i>


208
00:14:57.444 --> 00:14:58.344
<i>Are you hearing my voice</i>

209
00:14:58.477 --> 00:14:59.444
Witness Under the Tarp?

210
00:14:59.578 --> 00:15:00.544
<i>She can't hear you, okay?</i>

211
00:15:00.679 --> 00:15:02.012
I gave her something, she's...

212
00:15:02.144 --> 00:15:03.712
"Gave her something."

213
00:15:05.111 --> 00:15:06.979
So this is why you're
not gone, right?


214
00:15:07.111 --> 00:15:08.245
<i>So why? Who?</i>

215
00:15:08.377 --> 00:15:10.211
Who the fuck cares?
Who is this?


216
00:15:15.478 --> 00:15:16.979
Do you remember Laura?

217
00:15:17.111 --> 00:15:18.145
Maybe.

218
00:15:18.278 --> 00:15:19.812
Wait, redhead?

219
00:15:20.813 --> 00:15:21.879
Laura.

220
00:15:22.012 --> 00:15:24.345
My Laura from
twenty years ago.


221
00:15:24.478 --> 00:15:26.680
Oh, Laura, yeah,
I remember Laura,


222
00:15:26.813 --> 00:15:28.947
of-of course.

223
00:15:29.079 --> 00:15:32.212
Wow, that really brings
me back, man, why, why?


224
00:15:33.112 --> 00:15:34.846
<i>I need some answers.</i>

225
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.146
Oh, Keele, oh, man, no.

226
00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:39.079
This-this is way
beyond my expertise.


227
00:15:40.279 --> 00:15:41.146
But for you,

228
00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:42.913
I'm gonna make it work.

229
00:15:43.047 --> 00:15:44.013
<i>Absolutely make it work.</i>

230
00:15:44.146 --> 00:15:45.580
<i>Now, that, uh-</i>

231
00:15:45.714 --> 00:15:48.146
You-you-you really were
gonna check out, huh?


232
00:15:48.279 --> 00:15:49.814
Maybe I still am.

233
00:15:50.513 --> 00:15:52.246
<i>But I'm short now, but...</i>

234
00:15:53.781 --> 00:15:56.647
Well, you might be
a little shorter


235
00:15:56.781 --> 00:15:57.781
'cause you're gonna have,

236
00:15:57.914 --> 00:15:59.380
<i>I need one for
the safe house</i>


237
00:15:59.513 --> 00:16:03.247
<i>and one, two,
for the passports.</i>


238
00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:06.447
We'll see, huh?

239
00:16:09.547 --> 00:16:14.280
So this is the, uh, sum total
of all your ill deeds, huh?


240
00:16:14.414 --> 00:16:16.380
Eh, it's not bad.

241
00:16:19.347 --> 00:16:21.547
I just want some peace
and quiet until I die.


242
00:16:23.181 --> 00:16:24.414
Fuck!

243
00:16:24.547 --> 00:16:26.348
Excuse me, sir,
what's going on here?


244
00:16:27.415 --> 00:16:28.748
<i>A conversation.</i>

245
00:16:28.882 --> 00:16:31.515
Mm, okay,
is that all?


246
00:16:32.348 --> 00:16:35.081
- Yeah, that's all.
- <i>Okay.</i>


247
00:16:35.214 --> 00:16:37.749
You plan on paying for
your fuel, mister?


248
00:16:37.883 --> 00:16:39.415
What the hell?

249
00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:40.916
In a minute.

250
00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:42.548
Okay, how 'bout right now?

251
00:16:42.983 --> 00:16:45.749
How 'bout you give some
respect to your customers?


252
00:16:45.883 --> 00:16:47.448
Okay, so here's the thing.

253
00:16:47.583 --> 00:16:50.282
Ah, you've been sittin' here
for about, mmm, thirty minutes


254
00:16:50.416 --> 00:16:51.883
and ya haven't
fuckin' paid.


255
00:16:52.016 --> 00:16:54.215
So, you could be
a customer, yeah,


256
00:16:54.349 --> 00:16:57.416
or you could be a thieving
son of a bitch, so.


257
00:16:57.549 --> 00:16:58.916
We're talkin' a minute.

258
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.482
Right, oh,
yeah, no, yeah.


259
00:17:00.617 --> 00:17:03.951
And you can continue your
extremely important conversation


260
00:17:04.082 --> 00:17:05.951
after you pay for
your fuckin' fuel.


261
00:17:06.083 --> 00:17:07.382
Can you just roll
down the window


262
00:17:07.516 --> 00:17:08.750
and deal with
this guy, please?


263
00:17:08.884 --> 00:17:10.382
I will deal with it,
don't worry about.


264
00:17:10.516 --> 00:17:12.083
It's called
being considerate.


265
00:17:12.216 --> 00:17:13.449
Ya ever heard of that?

266
00:17:13.584 --> 00:17:14.617
- Oh my god.
- I just don't wanna be out here-


267
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.250
He's a Chatty Cathy,
isn't he?


268
00:17:16.383 --> 00:17:17.250
"Please, sir, can you
pay for your fuel?"


269
00:17:17.383 --> 00:17:18.850
Answer, "No, I do not."

270
00:17:18.984 --> 00:17:20.250
<i>'Cause the world fucking
revolves around you, doesn't it?</i>


271
00:17:20.383 --> 00:17:21.551
He can't see your
face as long-


272
00:17:21.685 --> 00:17:22.984
Fuck.
- Shoot him, just shoot him.


273
00:17:23.116 --> 00:17:24.116
All right, here.

274
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.585
Here's your money.

275
00:17:25.718 --> 00:17:27.317
Are you fucking
kidding me, man?


276
00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:29.585
<i>Better not expect me
to have change, asshole.</i>


277
00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:32.718
<i>Fuck!</i>

278
00:17:33.084 --> 00:17:34.251
What the fuck, man?

279
00:17:34.383 --> 00:17:35.952
I'm not an asshole!

280
00:17:36.517 --> 00:17:39.483
<i>Okay, wow,
um, on that note,</i>


281
00:17:39.618 --> 00:17:42.618
<i>I'm gonna go and get
those calls started and, uh,</i>


282
00:17:42.751 --> 00:17:45.151
I don't know, Keele,
just try to relax, man,


283
00:17:45.284 --> 00:17:47.284
it's not good for
your blood pressure.


284
00:17:47.752 --> 00:17:50.217
I need to hear
back soon, okay?


285
00:17:50.351 --> 00:17:52.084
<i>Yeah!</i>

286
00:18:28.987 --> 00:18:30.153
Aw.

287
00:18:55.988 --> 00:18:58.187
Where the fuck are you?

288
00:19:28.022 --> 00:19:29.423
Hey.

289
00:19:58.757 --> 00:20:00.557
<i>We're sorry,</i>

290
00:20:00.691 --> 00:20:02.257
<i>you have reached a number
that has been disconnected</i>


291
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:04.591
<i>or is no longer in service.</i>

292
00:20:04.724 --> 00:20:06.391
<i>Please check the number
or try your call again.</i>


293
00:20:06.524 --> 00:20:07.857
I'm gonna get you,
old man.


294
00:20:07.991 --> 00:20:09.357
<i>This is a recording.</i>

295
00:20:38.258 --> 00:20:39.959
Ow.

296
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.527
Let me out!

297
00:21:19.126 --> 00:21:20.660
Help!

298
00:21:24.061 --> 00:21:25.494
<i>Help!</i>

299
00:21:25.628 --> 00:21:27.193
God.

300
00:21:59.562 --> 00:22:01.662
<i>Let me out!</i>

301
00:22:02.896 --> 00:22:05.495
<i>Let me out!</i>

302
00:22:19.896 --> 00:22:21.563
Stop that shit!

303
00:22:22.463 --> 00:22:24.396
<i>This place is a rental.</i>

304
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.463
You're being very loud.

305
00:22:29.597 --> 00:22:32.364
How 'bout instead of
throwing stuff at the camera,


306
00:22:32.496 --> 00:22:34.229
<i>you lie down and you try
to take a bit of a nap?</i>


307
00:22:34.364 --> 00:22:36.264
<i>What do you think?</i>

308
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:39.163
Okay, well, I'm gonna
go get some food


309
00:22:39.297 --> 00:22:40.997
but if you're throwing
shit around the room,


310
00:22:41.129 --> 00:22:43.331
I'm not gonna trust
you with eggs.


311
00:22:47.064 --> 00:22:48.163
Okay then.

312
00:22:51.998 --> 00:22:54.065
All right, well, good,
there's more food for me.


313
00:22:55.664 --> 00:22:57.598
You having a good
time in there?


314
00:22:58.931 --> 00:23:02.197
<i>What do you want
from me, you asshole?</i>


315
00:23:08.865 --> 00:23:10.799
I'm not an asshole.

316
00:23:10.932 --> 00:23:11.999
Sure.

317
00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:13.265
But I'm the one
with the gun


318
00:23:13.398 --> 00:23:14.932
so you're gonna show
me some respect.


319
00:23:15.066 --> 00:23:16.165
- No!
- <i>Okay, I'm taking-</i>


320
00:23:16.298 --> 00:23:17.365
<i>No!</i>

321
00:23:17.498 --> 00:23:18.865
Hey!

322
00:23:19.732 --> 00:23:21.299
Pervert.

323
00:23:22.532 --> 00:23:25.266
To keep you quiet, okay?

324
00:23:25.399 --> 00:23:28.466
And stop messing
with the room!


325
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.098
Okay.

326
00:23:31.899 --> 00:23:33.466
Thank you.

327
00:23:35.533 --> 00:23:36.833
You can drink
the tap water.


328
00:23:36.967 --> 00:23:39.232
It doesn't taste good but
it's not gonna kill you.


329
00:24:12.468 --> 00:24:13.834
<i>Phone, Eli, it's ringing.</i>

330
00:24:13.968 --> 00:24:15.501
- Yeah, I hear it.
- <i>It's ringing, baby.</i>


331
00:24:15.634 --> 00:24:16.635
I know.

332
00:24:16.767 --> 00:24:17.901
You gonna answer it?

333
00:24:18.034 --> 00:24:19.468
Am I?

334
00:24:19.602 --> 00:24:21.068
Yeah. I'll-I'll
answer it, babes.


335
00:24:21.201 --> 00:24:23.068
- Thank you.
- <i>Yeah, no problem.</i>


336
00:24:31.768 --> 00:24:33.501
Got it, I got it.

337
00:24:33.635 --> 00:24:34.635
Go ahead.

338
00:24:34.768 --> 00:24:36.302
What's the word?

339
00:24:36.935 --> 00:24:38.135
I'm workin' on it.

340
00:24:38.269 --> 00:24:39.768
Why are you calling
the house, man?


341
00:24:39.902 --> 00:24:42.902
'Cause I called your cell
phone like three times already.


342
00:24:43.302 --> 00:24:44.969
Turn off that opera crap.

343
00:24:45.769 --> 00:24:48.336
It's the Thompson
Symphony Orchestra


344
00:24:48.469 --> 00:24:50.169
and it's very soothing.

345
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:54.269
I'm losing my
mind out here.


346
00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:55.769
How much longer?

347
00:24:55.903 --> 00:24:57.369
See, Keele,

348
00:24:57.502 --> 00:25:00.170
you could use a little symphony
in your life, my friend.


349
00:25:00.303 --> 00:25:02.070
What has she told you?

350
00:25:02.203 --> 00:25:04.869
Well, we're not
conversing at the moment.


351
00:25:05.003 --> 00:25:07.836
She's called me an asshole
and also a pervert.


352
00:25:09.103 --> 00:25:10.437
So you get her
to talk, right?


353
00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.303
Maybe she tells you
what you need to know,


354
00:25:12.437 --> 00:25:13.437
end of story.

355
00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:15.170
And how do I do that?

356
00:25:15.303 --> 00:25:16.303
Isn't that what you do?

357
00:25:16.437 --> 00:25:17.804
<i>No, for some reason,</i>

358
00:25:17.937 --> 00:25:18.937
I don't actually get to
know the people I murder,


359
00:25:19.071 --> 00:25:20.570
ya fuckin' moron.

360
00:25:21.204 --> 00:25:23.004
Look, it's special
circumstances.


361
00:25:23.137 --> 00:25:24.503
Now look,

362
00:25:24.637 --> 00:25:26.371
I hate to be the one to
tell you this but, um,


363
00:25:26.503 --> 00:25:28.471
<i>yeah, it's your new
friend who's lookin' for ya,</i>


364
00:25:28.604 --> 00:25:30.471
<i>so just prepare yourself.</i>

365
00:25:32.271 --> 00:25:33.837
That was quick.

366
00:25:36.037 --> 00:25:38.237
<i>Well then you just
better hurry up, okay?</i>


367
00:25:38.371 --> 00:25:40.204
<i>I can't take much
more of this.</i>


368
00:25:40.338 --> 00:25:41.871
This place.

369
00:25:42.005 --> 00:25:43.571
This girl.

370
00:25:43.705 --> 00:25:45.504
I mean, I thought I was done
with other people's bullshit.


371
00:25:45.638 --> 00:25:48.238
Look, there's-there's
one of him and two of you.


372
00:25:48.372 --> 00:25:50.638
So just leave her
there, right?


373
00:25:50.771 --> 00:25:53.738
<i>Let her be Palmer's problem,
just get outta there.</i>


374
00:25:53.871 --> 00:25:55.238
<i>It's just a thought.</i>

375
00:25:55.405 --> 00:25:57.205
My guys are on it,
I'm waiting on them.


376
00:25:57.339 --> 00:25:58.439
Who's on the phone?

377
00:25:58.572 --> 00:26:00.872
Uh, I put a rush
on your provolone.


378
00:26:02.372 --> 00:26:04.238
- Twenty.
- I'm good.


379
00:26:07.372 --> 00:26:08.672
I put a rush
on your order


380
00:26:08.806 --> 00:26:10.772
on account of the
whole Palmer thing.


381
00:26:10.906 --> 00:26:13.239
Nobody knows where you are
so if you can stand it-


382
00:26:13.373 --> 00:26:14.806
I can stand it.

383
00:26:14.939 --> 00:26:17.340
<i>Then just sit tight
and I'll be in touch.</i>


384
00:26:20.872 --> 00:26:22.106
Babes, I could eat.

385
00:26:22.239 --> 00:26:23.773
I could eat.

386
00:29:01.113 --> 00:29:02.646
Hey!

387
00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:09.246
Hello?

388
00:29:09.746 --> 00:29:11.246
Help!

389
00:29:28.881 --> 00:29:30.381
Okay.

390
00:30:16.782 --> 00:30:18.917
And so I'm like,
I take his money,


391
00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:20.482
and he hits me on
the fucking head.


392
00:30:20.616 --> 00:30:23.316
It's like, bam,
on the ground.


393
00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:25.650
<i>What the fuck is
that about, right?</i>


394
00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:07.755
<i>Hey!</i>

395
00:32:10.654 --> 00:32:11.888
Oh my god,
what have you done?


396
00:32:12.022 --> 00:32:13.187
What did you do?

397
00:32:18.688 --> 00:32:20.755
<i>Goddammit.</i>

398
00:32:25.755 --> 00:32:27.755
No, let me go!

399
00:32:32.221 --> 00:32:33.055
Stop it.

400
00:32:33.188 --> 00:32:34.089
No!

401
00:32:34.221 --> 00:32:35.089
Stop it!

402
00:32:37.188 --> 00:32:38.756
Just do it already!

403
00:32:38.889 --> 00:32:40.221
Do what?

404
00:32:40.355 --> 00:32:43.555
You're gonna do it,
so just do it.


405
00:32:53.056 --> 00:32:54.556
I'm not.

406
00:33:51.391 --> 00:33:52.892
Little bitch.

407
00:33:53.626 --> 00:33:55.626
<i>You said two hours.</i>

408
00:33:55.759 --> 00:33:58.158
Well, how long is
the lab saying now?


409
00:33:59.258 --> 00:34:01.826
You have
everything you need.


410
00:34:02.826 --> 00:34:05.158
No, you can't
fucking email me!


411
00:34:05.292 --> 00:34:06.660
Because this never happened!

412
00:34:06.792 --> 00:34:09.392
Look, it's not my DNA.

413
00:34:11.959 --> 00:34:12.860
Doesn't matter!

414
00:34:12.993 --> 00:34:14.359
Babe.

415
00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.827
Yeah, no, just, uh, tell me,
uh, when to pick up the order


416
00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.492
and I'll be there.

417
00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:22.193
Love you, love you.

418
00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.793
And we never spoke, okay?

419
00:34:31.293 --> 00:34:32.860
Oh it's good!

420
00:34:32.994 --> 00:34:34.661
Babe, it's good.

421
00:34:35.293 --> 00:34:36.861
Fucking good.

422
00:35:16.996 --> 00:35:19.695
<i>Let's try this again, okay?</i>

423
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:21.395
<i>Good morning!</i>

424
00:35:22.195 --> 00:35:23.696
Listen,

425
00:35:24.495 --> 00:35:26.963
none of this shit from earlier,
all right?


426
00:35:27.096 --> 00:35:28.663
I forgive you.

427
00:35:32.563 --> 00:35:34.428
Eggs coming through, here.

428
00:35:53.296 --> 00:35:54.831
Okay.

429
00:35:56.229 --> 00:35:57.731
Sorry there's no cutlery.

430
00:35:58.363 --> 00:35:59.931
<i>You know why.</i>

431
00:36:00.731 --> 00:36:03.631
<i>And there's no toaster
here so don't even ask.</i>


432
00:36:03.764 --> 00:36:06.531
<i>I guess that's what they
call roughin' it, huh?</i>


433
00:36:19.932 --> 00:36:22.230
Okay, look, we got
off to a bad start.


434
00:36:22.364 --> 00:36:24.330
<i>But I'm feeding you now,
aren't I?</i>


435
00:36:29.065 --> 00:36:31.832
<i>You're quite the
little fighter though.</i>


436
00:36:31.965 --> 00:36:33.499
Give you that.

437
00:36:45.899 --> 00:36:49.299
So I got some coffee,
you want some coffee?


438
00:36:51.566 --> 00:36:53.866
<i>Look, the sooner
you start talking,</i>


439
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.500
the better things will be.

440
00:37:00.767 --> 00:37:02.332
All right.

441
00:37:02.867 --> 00:37:04.567
Well, this was nice!

442
00:38:09.335 --> 00:38:11.235
Help!

443
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:15.803
You ready to talk?

444
00:38:16.637 --> 00:38:18.403
<i>I want coffee.</i>

445
00:38:20.036 --> 00:38:21.570
Now you want coffee?

446
00:38:22.037 --> 00:38:23.570
<i>Yes.</i>

447
00:38:26.037 --> 00:38:27.570
Now she wants coffee.

448
00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:36.604
Let's go.

449
00:38:38.571 --> 00:38:40.136
Stand up.

450
00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:03.071
This wouldn't be able to
slide under the door anyway,


451
00:39:03.204 --> 00:39:04.739
would it?

452
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:15.605
Mm!

453
00:39:15.739 --> 00:39:17.605
It's nuclear.

454
00:39:17.739 --> 00:39:18.605
What?

455
00:39:18.739 --> 00:39:20.306
Extremely hot?

456
00:39:21.238 --> 00:39:22.339
I didn't know.

457
00:39:22.473 --> 00:39:23.905
Well you coulda
checked first.


458
00:39:24.039 --> 00:39:25.271
Yeah, I coulda done
your nails first too


459
00:39:25.406 --> 00:39:27.306
but life's not fair,
is it?


460
00:39:39.539 --> 00:39:41.706
You got make up
on your scar.


461
00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.374
There.

462
00:39:43.906 --> 00:39:45.474
How'd you get that?

463
00:39:46.107 --> 00:39:46.973
I don't know.

464
00:39:47.107 --> 00:39:48.139
You don't know?

465
00:39:48.273 --> 00:39:49.773
No.

466
00:39:49.906 --> 00:39:52.374
You don't know how you got
that huge scar on your neck?


467
00:40:02.008 --> 00:40:05.440
If I untie ya, you gonna
throw the nuclear coffee at me?


468
00:40:05.574 --> 00:40:07.807
'Cause I'll put you
right back in that room.


469
00:40:37.275 --> 00:40:39.174
Stop looking at my scar.

470
00:40:43.975 --> 00:40:45.542
Why am I here?

471
00:40:47.174 --> 00:40:48.709
We're hiding out.

472
00:40:48.976 --> 00:40:50.509
Where's the other guy?

473
00:40:51.309 --> 00:40:53.376
That's who we're
hiding out from.


474
00:40:56.776 --> 00:40:58.843
I thought you
wanted to kill me.


475
00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:00.676
If I wanted you dead,

476
00:41:00.809 --> 00:41:01.809
I'd get my silencer,
take you in the woods and-


477
00:41:01.943 --> 00:41:03.477
Then why am I here?

478
00:41:04.443 --> 00:41:06.110
I need to ask you
some questions.


479
00:41:06.243 --> 00:41:07.810
About what?

480
00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:11.377
Who are you?

481
00:41:12.011 --> 00:41:13.110
Peyton Sallow.

482
00:41:13.243 --> 00:41:14.944
Yeah, I know that.

483
00:41:15.077 --> 00:41:16.577
Then why'd you ask?

484
00:41:18.044 --> 00:41:19.610
Just tell me somethin'.

485
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:23.810
About yourself, you know,
just somethin'.


486
00:41:25.511 --> 00:41:26.977
My name is Peyton Sallow.

487
00:41:27.111 --> 00:41:28.378
I saw you kill a guy,

488
00:41:28.511 --> 00:41:29.678
what else do
you wanna know?


489
00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:30.844
Christ, no, I mean,

490
00:41:30.977 --> 00:41:32.711
like where you from, just-

491
00:41:33.544 --> 00:41:34.845
Detroit.

492
00:41:35.511 --> 00:41:36.878
Where'd you grow up?

493
00:41:37.012 --> 00:41:38.578
Detroit.

494
00:41:39.344 --> 00:41:42.544
And what about your mom,
or your dad?


495
00:41:44.711 --> 00:41:45.678
What about them?

496
00:41:45.811 --> 00:41:47.212
<i>I don't know,
just somethin'.</i>


497
00:41:47.345 --> 00:41:48.845
What are their names?

498
00:41:48.978 --> 00:41:50.512
Why, so you can kill them?

499
00:41:50.645 --> 00:41:52.745
Can you just please
work with me here?


500
00:41:52.878 --> 00:41:54.379
I really wanna get out
of this shit house


501
00:41:54.512 --> 00:41:55.746
sometime in the
near future.


502
00:41:55.878 --> 00:41:56.846
So leave then!

503
00:41:56.978 --> 00:41:57.846
You're making me stay.

504
00:41:57.978 --> 00:41:59.412
No I'm not!

505
00:41:59.545 --> 00:42:01.879
Yeah, the fact that you exist
is making me stay, okay?


506
00:42:03.046 --> 00:42:04.345
Okay.

507
00:42:04.479 --> 00:42:06.512
Okay, Jesus, what's
with all the attitude?


508
00:42:06.646 --> 00:42:08.113
You're freaking me out, okay?!

509
00:42:08.246 --> 00:42:09.113
I'm freaking you out?

510
00:42:09.246 --> 00:42:10.545
Yeah.

511
00:42:10.679 --> 00:42:11.446
Me just talkin' to you
is freaking you out?


512
00:42:11.579 --> 00:42:12.512
Yeah!

513
00:42:12.646 --> 00:42:13.446
Okay, well then,
I'm gonna freak out too.


514
00:42:13.579 --> 00:42:14.712
Let's all freak out!

515
00:42:14.846 --> 00:42:16.413
I'm gonna freak out, yup.

516
00:42:16.546 --> 00:42:18.146
Freakin' out, ohhhh!

517
00:42:22.046 --> 00:42:23.613
Jesus.

518
00:42:34.546 --> 00:42:36.447
I don't need this shit.

519
00:42:40.381 --> 00:42:41.680
You've got a problem.

520
00:42:41.813 --> 00:42:44.280
Yeah, and you're a hooker
tied to a chair, so.


521
00:42:44.414 --> 00:42:45.947
I'm a call girl,
there's a difference.


522
00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.648
Yeah, not much.

523
00:42:47.781 --> 00:42:49.280
You're judging me?

524
00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:51.614
You cut off people's heads.

525
00:42:51.748 --> 00:42:54.347
I do not cut off people's heads,
that's the other guy.


526
00:42:54.481 --> 00:42:56.048
Yeah, well,
you're still a murderer.


527
00:42:56.181 --> 00:42:58.514
And you rent yourself
out by the hour!


528
00:42:59.082 --> 00:43:00.648
And you don't?

529
00:43:20.415 --> 00:43:22.782
Oh, stop crying.

530
00:43:29.749 --> 00:43:32.815
Will you just,
can you just stop, please?


531
00:43:34.949 --> 00:43:37.083
I can't breathe.

532
00:43:37.216 --> 00:43:38.216
Stop crying.

533
00:44:21.884 --> 00:44:23.585
Put the glass down.

534
00:44:29.785 --> 00:44:31.718
That's it, you're going
back in the room.


535
00:44:31.852 --> 00:44:32.852
No.

536
00:44:32.986 --> 00:44:34.120
<i>Yeah.</i>

537
00:44:34.252 --> 00:44:36.385
You had your chance
and you blew it.


538
00:44:36.518 --> 00:44:37.652
I promise I won't
do it again.


539
00:44:37.785 --> 00:44:40.219
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>
- You can trust me.


540
00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.185
Yeah, I don't think so.

541
00:44:42.319 --> 00:44:44.852
<i>Fine, you wanna
know about me?</i>


542
00:44:46.152 --> 00:44:47.753
About this?

543
00:44:51.719 --> 00:44:53.252
I was nine.

544
00:44:54.319 --> 00:44:56.653
<i>Like usual,
there's a new guy over.</i>


545
00:44:58.153 --> 00:44:59.886
And he's drunk.

546
00:45:03.519 --> 00:45:05.054
I walked into the kitchen

547
00:45:05.186 --> 00:45:07.919
and I guess he didn't like me
drinking his orange juice.


548
00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:13.654
He had a ring on, so.

549
00:45:33.688 --> 00:45:37.454
That other guy who chops
people's heads off,


550
00:45:37.588 --> 00:45:39.122
he wants to kill you.

551
00:45:39.888 --> 00:45:42.922
So if you run from here,
he'll do anything to find you.


552
00:45:44.023 --> 00:45:46.421
I'm the only thing
between you and him.


553
00:45:47.755 --> 00:45:49.288
You got it?

554
00:45:50.922 --> 00:45:52.422
Okay.

555
00:46:08.222 --> 00:46:10.789
You can't walk
around in that.


556
00:46:12.522 --> 00:46:14.455
What's wrong with this?

557
00:46:17.256 --> 00:46:19.957
You might be more
comfortable in these.


558
00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:21.656
<i>Bathroom's upstairs.</i>

559
00:47:34.692 --> 00:47:36.660
You guy with the complaint?

560
00:47:36.792 --> 00:47:37.893
And the grey van?

561
00:47:38.027 --> 00:47:39.192
Another one?

562
00:47:39.326 --> 00:47:40.893
Yeah, I got assigned
to your case.


563
00:47:41.027 --> 00:47:42.894
So, you must be special.

564
00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:47.894
Okay, I'm not just some
guy with a complaint, okay?


565
00:47:48.028 --> 00:47:49.193
I'm Doug.

566
00:47:49.326 --> 00:47:51.028
Assistant Manager.

567
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:52.726
You sound special, Doug.

568
00:47:53.994 --> 00:47:55.827
Talk to the other cops.
I don't got all day.


569
00:47:55.961 --> 00:47:57.726
<i>You bandage that yourself?</i>

570
00:47:58.726 --> 00:48:00.260
This? Yeah.

571
00:48:01.128 --> 00:48:02.761
Well, it's a
little dramatic.


572
00:48:03.327 --> 00:48:05.661
Well, it hurts,
a lot, so.


573
00:48:05.795 --> 00:48:08.028
<i>A customer might find
that off-putting.</i>


574
00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.061
<i>They might think that
a crime happened here</i>


575
00:48:10.193 --> 00:48:12.427
<i>and then they might decide to
take their business elsewhere.</i>


576
00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.862
And I'm sure that my
presence isn't helping.


577
00:48:15.995 --> 00:48:18.427
You got a question about
these guys or what?


578
00:48:19.194 --> 00:48:20.694
Guys?

579
00:48:20.828 --> 00:48:24.062
<i>Like I told yous before,
there's two guys in a car.</i>


580
00:48:24.194 --> 00:48:25.294
One of them didn't
pay his bill


581
00:48:25.428 --> 00:48:27.261
so I approached
the vehicle.


582
00:48:28.495 --> 00:48:30.194
Did you get a licence plate
on the other vehicle?


583
00:48:30.328 --> 00:48:33.561
Again, it's 551UF,

584
00:48:33.695 --> 00:48:34.963
I fucking forget
the last two.


585
00:48:35.095 --> 00:48:38.162
But it was a-is a
black muscle car.


586
00:48:38.963 --> 00:48:40.528
Real nice car.

587
00:48:42.195 --> 00:48:43.929
<i>This one of the guys?</i>

588
00:48:47.362 --> 00:48:48.728
Yeah.

589
00:48:48.863 --> 00:48:51.229
Yeah, that's the fuckin'
asshole right there, yeah.


590
00:48:51.362 --> 00:48:53.562
Ah, the other guy,
can you describe him?


591
00:48:54.929 --> 00:48:56.229
Real Jewy, man.

592
00:48:56.362 --> 00:48:57.997
I don't know what else
to fuckin' tell ya.


593
00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:00.596
Again, you guys have gotta
get your heads together, man.


594
00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:03.329
<i>The crime in this town
is going through the,</i>


595
00:49:03.462 --> 00:49:04.964
through the fuckin'
roof, okay?


596
00:49:05.097 --> 00:49:05.964
Do your job.

597
00:49:07.097 --> 00:49:07.964
<i>Do your job.</i>

598
00:49:08.097 --> 00:49:09.163
Yeah.

599
00:49:09.296 --> 00:49:10.263
Ah, thank you
for your tips.


600
00:49:10.397 --> 00:49:11.730
Um, listen.

601
00:49:11.864 --> 00:49:13.830
Do you mind following
me back to my vehicle?


602
00:49:13.964 --> 00:49:16.530
I've got some headshots
I'd like you to review.


603
00:49:17.731 --> 00:49:19.263
You couldn't-you couldn't
have fuckin', oh god.


604
00:49:19.397 --> 00:49:21.196
Make it quick, okay,
I don't got all day.


605
00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:22.865
It'll only take a second.

606
00:50:41.299 --> 00:50:42.868
Hello?

607
00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:45.768
<i>Hello?</i>

608
00:50:46.868 --> 00:50:47.734
<i>Hello?</i>

609
00:50:53.001 --> 00:50:54.534
Got you.

610
00:50:55.035 --> 00:50:56.534
Hello?

611
00:50:58.669 --> 00:50:59.869
<i>Baby, who is it?</i>

612
00:51:00.001 --> 00:51:01.534
No one, babes.

613
00:51:19.335 --> 00:51:20.902
<i>Feel better?</i>

614
00:51:21.036 --> 00:51:22.002
Huh?

615
00:51:22.136 --> 00:51:23.468
<i>The clothes.</i>

616
00:51:23.603 --> 00:51:25.368
<i>Come sit in here.</i>

617
00:51:47.937 --> 00:51:50.302
What are those pills for?

618
00:51:53.403 --> 00:51:55.170
Bunch of things.

619
00:51:57.536 --> 00:51:59.104
You ever try breathing?

620
00:51:59.237 --> 00:52:02.504
Yeah. Yeah, I try breathing.

621
00:52:02.637 --> 00:52:05.737
No like four, seven, eight?

622
00:52:06.605 --> 00:52:09.203
<i>When you're stressed
out you close your eyes,</i>


623
00:52:09.337 --> 00:52:10.872
count in for four.

624
00:52:12.838 --> 00:52:14.404
<i>Hold for seven.</i>

625
00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:18.705
<i>Then you go out for eight.</i>

626
00:52:19.938 --> 00:52:21.470
Until you feel better.

627
00:52:21.872 --> 00:52:23.105
<i>Try it.</i>

628
00:52:23.238 --> 00:52:25.005
That's some real hippy
crap right there.


629
00:52:25.139 --> 00:52:27.005
<i>No, it's not.</i>

630
00:52:27.805 --> 00:52:30.238
It's an actual
medical thing.


631
00:52:30.371 --> 00:52:32.905
I promise it works,
just try it.


632
00:52:34.606 --> 00:52:35.905
Come on.

633
00:52:37.539 --> 00:52:39.338
It'll make you
feel better.


634
00:52:52.706 --> 00:52:54.773
Nope, don't feel
any better.


635
00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:58.873
<i>Does that make you calm?</i>

636
00:52:59.607 --> 00:53:01.172
Mmm hmm.

637
00:53:03.974 --> 00:53:07.205
So is what you said about
that other guy true?


638
00:53:09.907 --> 00:53:11.372
Yeah, it's true.

639
00:53:11.874 --> 00:53:13.407
<i>His name's Palmer.</i>

640
00:53:14.173 --> 00:53:15.607
<i>So what's the plan?</i>

641
00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.508
Are you gonna
turn him in?


642
00:53:18.974 --> 00:53:23.074
No, with these people,
there's always another guy.


643
00:53:23.206 --> 00:53:24.775
So what are we gonna do?

644
00:53:26.173 --> 00:53:28.074
There's only two ways out.

645
00:53:28.574 --> 00:53:32.373
Listen, gotta tell
you something.


646
00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:38.374
I'm taking you to Argentina.

647
00:53:39.207 --> 00:53:40.541
What?

648
00:53:40.675 --> 00:53:43.475
Yeah, I thought I'd-I'd
take you somewhere


649
00:53:43.609 --> 00:53:45.542
that you're gonna like.

650
00:53:46.776 --> 00:53:48.809
That's my stuff!

651
00:53:50.075 --> 00:53:51.709
Yeah, it's not embarrassing.

652
00:53:53.075 --> 00:53:54.174
See this?

653
00:53:54.307 --> 00:53:56.307
That's personal!

654
00:53:56.842 --> 00:53:58.175
So what?

655
00:53:58.307 --> 00:54:00.043
Do you know how much shit I
usually collect on my marks?


656
00:54:00.175 --> 00:54:01.475
That's fuck all.

657
00:54:02.143 --> 00:54:04.942
And how 'bout little bit of
fucking gratitude here, huh?


658
00:54:05.076 --> 00:54:06.942
I am not going.

659
00:54:07.076 --> 00:54:08.643
You don't have a choice!

660
00:54:10.342 --> 00:54:11.842
Hey!

661
00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:14.443
Give her back.

662
00:54:14.576 --> 00:54:15.943
No.

663
00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:23.010
<i>Oh, I'm sorry,
did you want this?</i>


664
00:54:23.144 --> 00:54:26.209
Oh, what are you gonna
do with that now, huh?


665
00:54:26.343 --> 00:54:27.209
Hey.

666
00:54:27.343 --> 00:54:28.209
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

667
00:54:30.444 --> 00:54:31.743
Don't, don't.

668
00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:34.243
No!

669
00:54:39.511 --> 00:54:41.209
Get back here!

670
00:54:41.811 --> 00:54:43.343
Peyton!

671
00:54:44.376 --> 00:54:46.444
Peyton, stop, hey!

672
00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:50.744
<i>HELP!</i>

673
00:54:59.111 --> 00:55:00.612
<i>I hate you!</i>

674
00:55:19.046 --> 00:55:20.612
<i>Whoa.</i>

675
00:55:22.012 --> 00:55:23.579
Palmer.

676
00:55:25.278 --> 00:55:26.746
Swanky.

677
00:55:27.446 --> 00:55:29.813
Why don't you just knock
like a normal person here?


678
00:55:29.946 --> 00:55:31.311
<i>What-what's-what's
going on?</i>


679
00:55:31.446 --> 00:55:32.713
What's with the badge?

680
00:55:32.846 --> 00:55:33.780
<i>Oh, you like it?</i>

681
00:55:33.913 --> 00:55:37.646
So did the gas station
guy on 24?


682
00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.147
Said he saw you
there with Keele.


683
00:55:40.279 --> 00:55:41.680
Yeah.

684
00:55:41.813 --> 00:55:43.913
Yeah, see, a man approaches
me wanting a service


685
00:55:44.047 --> 00:55:46.614
<i>as long as he's willing
to pay for that service,</i>


686
00:55:46.746 --> 00:55:47.713
then I abide.

687
00:55:47.846 --> 00:55:49.781
Well, now I'm in need
of your service.


688
00:55:50.414 --> 00:55:51.847
Where is he?

689
00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:53.514
I don't know.

690
00:55:54.847 --> 00:55:56.312
Man, he fucked
with my business


691
00:55:56.447 --> 00:55:57.814
and I don't like
the way that feels.


692
00:55:57.947 --> 00:55:59.014
Hey, what are you-

693
00:55:59.148 --> 00:56:00.312
<i>Hey!</i>

694
00:56:00.447 --> 00:56:01.981
Come on, man,
what are you doing?


695
00:56:02.114 --> 00:56:03.614
Do you have any idea
how expensive that is?


696
00:56:03.747 --> 00:56:04.814
<i>What was that?</i>

697
00:56:04.947 --> 00:56:06.114
Oh, shit, honey-

698
00:56:06.247 --> 00:56:06.814
Oh my god.
- It's okay, everything-


699
00:56:06.947 --> 00:56:08.348
Hello.

700
00:56:08.481 --> 00:56:09.348
Please, honey, honey, honey,
it's a misunderstanding.


701
00:56:09.481 --> 00:56:10.348
I got it under control.

702
00:56:10.481 --> 00:56:11.881
No, no, no, no, no, no,

703
00:56:12.014 --> 00:56:13.947
<i>this is an infringement
on our civil liberties.</i>


704
00:56:14.081 --> 00:56:15.448
<i>Can you please go back
in your bedroom, go back-</i>


705
00:56:15.581 --> 00:56:16.815
No, take out your
phone and tape him!


706
00:56:16.947 --> 00:56:18.314
Ma'am, would you kindly
shut the fuck up?


707
00:56:18.448 --> 00:56:19.448
- Okay, okay, all right.
- Fuck!


708
00:56:19.581 --> 00:56:20.748
- Jesus, fuck!
- Easy man, easy!


709
00:56:20.882 --> 00:56:22.314
Look, look, I got
this under control.


710
00:56:22.448 --> 00:56:23.581
<i>Leave her alone, okay?</i>

711
00:56:23.715 --> 00:56:24.982
She doesn't know
anything about anything.


712
00:56:25.115 --> 00:56:25.882
She doesn't
know about you?


713
00:56:26.015 --> 00:56:27.415
No, no, well, no.

714
00:56:27.548 --> 00:56:29.782
Nothing, nothing, nothing
important and not that-


715
00:56:29.915 --> 00:56:31.581
Nothing important?

716
00:56:32.449 --> 00:56:33.449
You know what your
husband does?


717
00:56:33.581 --> 00:56:35.149
Yeah, he imports cheese.

718
00:56:35.281 --> 00:56:36.416
- I import cheese.
- <i>"He imports cheese."</i>


719
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:38.582
No, he's a fixer.
That's a criminal.


720
00:56:38.716 --> 00:56:40.582
He's aiding a
murderer right now.


721
00:56:40.716 --> 00:56:42.349
- What? Why are you saying this?
- What is he saying?


722
00:56:42.482 --> 00:56:45.248
You should be honest with
your bride before you die!


723
00:56:45.382 --> 00:56:47.649
Here, look, look,
I'll start, I'll start.


724
00:56:49.482 --> 00:56:51.083
Well, I'm not a real cop.

725
00:56:51.215 --> 00:56:52.716
Oh!

726
00:56:53.716 --> 00:56:54.849
It looks pretty
good though, right?


727
00:56:54.983 --> 00:56:56.249
<i>Okay, all right.</i>

728
00:56:56.849 --> 00:56:58.316
Okay, Keele-
- Explain, yeah.


729
00:56:58.450 --> 00:56:59.916
- Keele.
- Come on, let's go.


730
00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:01.283
- <i>Keele.</i>
- Come on!


731
00:57:01.417 --> 00:57:02.849
Keele's got two hundred K
on him, okay?


732
00:57:02.983 --> 00:57:04.383
Oh, fuck you, man.

733
00:57:04.517 --> 00:57:06.417
Okay? Well, I'm sure we
can work something out.


734
00:57:07.249 --> 00:57:09.950
- Sorry, baby.
- Fuck! Should've-


735
00:57:10.083 --> 00:57:11.650
Sorry, baby.
- Bastard!


736
00:57:12.817 --> 00:57:13.784
Great.

737
00:57:13.917 --> 00:57:15.051
Stay there.

738
00:57:15.183 --> 00:57:16.917
<i>Hello! Hello, police?</i>

739
00:57:18.084 --> 00:57:19.317
<i>UGH!</i>

740
00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:21.850
<i>You better fix this Eli,
you swore!</i>


741
00:57:21.984 --> 00:57:23.117
You made a promise.

742
00:57:23.251 --> 00:57:23.984
<i>You made a vow!</i>

743
00:57:24.117 --> 00:57:25.151
A little hubbah.

744
00:57:25.284 --> 00:57:26.884
- Yeah, I remember.
- <i>Yeah.</i>


745
00:57:27.017 --> 00:57:28.384
You know I'm gonna need to
do something about that.


746
00:57:28.518 --> 00:57:30.751
Okay, please don't, please.

747
00:57:32.751 --> 00:57:35.484
Okay, what do
you wanna know?


748
00:57:36.851 --> 00:57:38.418
Does he know I'm coming?

749
00:57:39.018 --> 00:57:40.584
Yes.

750
00:57:41.384 --> 00:57:43.318
Why'd he take her?

751
00:58:00.886 --> 00:58:02.185
That's too bad.

752
00:58:02.318 --> 00:58:04.519
<i>Find out right
before she dies.</i>


753
00:58:05.919 --> 00:58:07.485
Wait, wait, you-

754
00:58:07.619 --> 00:58:11.185
You're gonna break the guy's
heart right before you kill him?


755
00:58:11.319 --> 00:58:13.219
That's life.

756
00:58:19.386 --> 00:58:21.253
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.


757
00:58:22.753 --> 00:58:24.253
Where is he?

758
00:58:35.887 --> 00:58:37.454
Come on.

759
00:59:23.889 --> 00:59:25.622
<i>You've
reached Eli's Fine Cheeses.</i>


760
00:59:25.755 --> 00:59:27.523
<i>I can't get to
the phone right-</i>


761
00:59:37.222 --> 00:59:38.790
Is it any better?

762
00:59:39.256 --> 00:59:40.723
No.

763
00:59:43.322 --> 00:59:44.756
<i>The van's toast,</i>

764
00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:46.357
<i>and you'd be too if
you tripped that wire.</i>


765
00:59:46.489 --> 00:59:48.257
Well, sorry.

766
00:59:49.357 --> 00:59:51.190
Look, I wasn't
trying to shoot ya.


767
00:59:51.323 --> 00:59:52.856
<i>Well, I know that now.</i>

768
01:00:10.159 --> 01:00:11.724
Oof.

769
01:00:12.524 --> 01:00:14.358
That's gonna need something.

770
01:00:14.491 --> 01:00:16.224
You got a fever?

771
01:00:33.558 --> 01:00:35.025
You thought I was
gonna kill ya, right?


772
01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.692
Here you are alive.

773
01:00:37.126 --> 01:00:38.858
I let you out,

774
01:00:38.992 --> 01:00:40.093
I showed you the plan.

775
01:00:40.225 --> 01:00:41.559
I mean,
what's it gonna take?


776
01:00:42.093 --> 01:00:43.626
For what?

777
01:00:44.225 --> 01:00:45.925
For you to trust me.

778
01:00:48.526 --> 01:00:50.392
What's your name?

779
01:00:55.726 --> 01:00:57.260
It's James.

780
01:00:58.726 --> 01:01:01.493
And what's your
last name, James?


781
01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:06.726
Uh...

782
01:01:07.427 --> 01:01:09.293
That's what I thought.

783
01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.760
It's for your own good you
don't know my name, okay?


784
01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:19.627
Will you just tell
me why I'm here?


785
01:01:51.328 --> 01:01:53.228
<i>I knew your mother.</i>

786
01:01:55.761 --> 01:01:56.729
How?

787
01:01:56.861 --> 01:02:00.163
Well, we met after
I was discharged.


788
01:02:00.295 --> 01:02:01.961
It was a long time ago.

789
01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:06.696
Did you know
that she died?


790
01:02:08.196 --> 01:02:09.796
No.

791
01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:14.963
I mean, we tried to
make it work, you know?


792
01:02:15.097 --> 01:02:16.829
But it was complicated.

793
01:02:19.663 --> 01:02:22.196
Are you saying you
slept with my mother?


794
01:02:22.329 --> 01:02:23.862
No, it was...

795
01:02:26.196 --> 01:02:28.196
It was more than
that, Peyton.


796
01:02:28.329 --> 01:02:29.863
What do you mean?

797
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:32.930
I mean,
I can't be sure, but...


798
01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:40.397
No.

799
01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:42.797
It's not you.

800
01:02:45.098 --> 01:02:47.464
So then you know
who your dad is?


801
01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.264
Do you?

802
01:02:53.397 --> 01:02:57.497
Well, I got a friend
looking into it, so.


803
01:02:59.564 --> 01:03:02.331
She said he was
a good man.


804
01:03:03.864 --> 01:03:05.365
It's not you.

805
01:03:13.298 --> 01:03:15.732
Well, either way,
we're going to Argentina.


806
01:03:30.133 --> 01:03:31.832
Whoa, whoa, buddy, buddy!

807
01:03:31.966 --> 01:03:33.666
<i>It's me, it's just me!</i>

808
01:03:36.332 --> 01:03:37.900
What are you doing here?

809
01:03:38.566 --> 01:03:40.133
It's been a long day, okay?

810
01:03:40.266 --> 01:03:42.332
Please, please.

811
01:03:45.001 --> 01:03:46.200
- Peyton.
- What?


812
01:03:46.332 --> 01:03:47.700
It's okay.

813
01:03:47.967 --> 01:03:50.233
<i>Hey, sorry about
that, yeah, with the-</i>


814
01:03:50.866 --> 01:03:52.533
Um, I'm Eli.

815
01:03:54.168 --> 01:03:55.700
Nice to-

816
01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:57.733
I got what you wanted.

817
01:03:57.867 --> 01:03:59.534
- Come in.
- Yeah.


818
01:04:00.867 --> 01:04:02.200
You stay here.

819
01:04:02.567 --> 01:04:04.034
<i>You don't move.</i>

820
01:04:04.168 --> 01:04:05.667
I mean it.

821
01:04:14.135 --> 01:04:16.834
<i>Swanson hasn't
made good contact with the ball,</i>


822
01:04:16.968 --> 01:04:17.935
<i>and is just at the-</i>

823
01:04:20.334 --> 01:04:21.435
What the hell happened
to your face?


824
01:04:21.568 --> 01:04:23.735
What, oh, Palmer,
that's what.


825
01:04:23.868 --> 01:04:25.868
Yeah, he, uh, somehow
he found the gas guy.


826
01:04:26.002 --> 01:04:28.568
He came to my house but I gave
him an address in Hillsdale.


827
01:04:28.702 --> 01:04:29.836
Are you sure you're
not followed?


828
01:04:29.969 --> 01:04:31.069
There's no way,
there's no way.


829
01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:32.468
It was too long of a ride,

830
01:04:32.601 --> 01:04:33.836
I would've-I would've
made him for sure.


831
01:04:33.969 --> 01:04:35.435
That's one guy you
don't want on your tail.


832
01:04:35.568 --> 01:04:36.702
You're positive, right?

833
01:04:36.836 --> 01:04:38.170
'Cause we're
sittin' ducks here.


834
01:04:38.302 --> 01:04:39.668
Yes. Yes, let's get
this done, okay?


835
01:04:39.802 --> 01:04:41.936
Let's, you can fly the
coop for good this time


836
01:04:42.070 --> 01:04:43.202
and get outta here.

837
01:04:43.335 --> 01:04:44.235
I wanna get
outta this shithole.


838
01:04:44.369 --> 01:04:45.202
Yeah, no kidding,
this is-


839
01:04:45.335 --> 01:04:46.669
this is a safe house?

840
01:04:46.802 --> 01:04:49.436
<i>Yeah, I-I grossly
overpaid for this.</i>


841
01:04:54.369 --> 01:04:56.970
Trucking? Trucking, huh?

842
01:04:57.103 --> 01:04:58.104
Yeah, no, I-

843
01:04:58.235 --> 01:04:59.837
I can see that.

844
01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:03.270
Well, I had a real nice semi
picked out for me up in Alaska.


845
01:05:03.402 --> 01:05:06.137
But, you know,
change of plans.


846
01:05:06.904 --> 01:05:09.804
Yeah, uh, here,
I got some, uh,


847
01:05:10.804 --> 01:05:13.203
I got some bad
news for ya, man.


848
01:05:13.804 --> 01:05:15.004
What?

849
01:05:15.137 --> 01:05:19.236
Okay, your new name,
it's, uh, Lester Kaplowski.


850
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:23.370
Sorry man,
it's out of my hands.


851
01:05:23.905 --> 01:05:27.105
<i>Here, I didn't-I
didn't pick it.</i>


852
01:05:28.403 --> 01:05:29.503
I appreciate it.

853
01:05:29.637 --> 01:05:30.770
<i>Yeah, no problem.</i>

854
01:05:30.905 --> 01:05:32.570
<i>What-what's,
what's this?</i>


855
01:05:34.005 --> 01:05:35.271
I haven't slept, so.

856
01:05:35.404 --> 01:05:36.471
Well, that's understandable.

857
01:05:36.604 --> 01:05:38.504
And the girl's
a handful, so.


858
01:05:39.404 --> 01:05:41.604
<i>On a tear, zero-</i>

859
01:05:42.005 --> 01:05:43.005
She's a good-looking kid.

860
01:05:43.138 --> 01:05:44.304
- Hey!
- What?


861
01:05:44.438 --> 01:05:46.204
Take it easy.

862
01:05:47.371 --> 01:05:48.906
<i>Here.</i>

863
01:05:49.404 --> 01:05:50.906
<i>What?</i>

864
01:05:51.839 --> 01:05:53.772
It's for the
other passport.


865
01:05:55.372 --> 01:05:57.872
So, uh, so you decided.

866
01:05:58.006 --> 01:05:59.372
Mmm hmm.

867
01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:01.272
So, you-you're not
even gonna ask me?


868
01:06:01.405 --> 01:06:03.305
Doesn't matter now.

869
01:06:04.639 --> 01:06:06.639
You can't be
serious, man, you-


870
01:06:06.773 --> 01:06:08.706
<i>you put all of our
lives on the line,</i>


871
01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:11.139
for-for-for what then?
For what?


872
01:06:11.272 --> 01:06:12.272
For what you just
put in your pocket.


873
01:06:12.405 --> 01:06:14.040
Okay, no,
you should know-


874
01:06:14.174 --> 01:06:15.405
I should know what?

875
01:06:15.539 --> 01:06:16.706
Drop it!
Okay, let's go.


876
01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:18.306
No, okay, well,
fuck it, fuck it.


877
01:06:18.439 --> 01:06:20.873
Congratulations.
You're not a father.


878
01:06:22.074 --> 01:06:23.440
Whoa, hey, buddy, buddy!

879
01:06:23.573 --> 01:06:24.807
I said don't tell me!

880
01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.673
Hey, what is happening
here right now?


881
01:06:26.807 --> 01:06:28.673
I thought that
was a good thing!


882
01:06:29.174 --> 01:06:30.673
<i>Jesus.</i>

883
01:06:34.606 --> 01:06:38.339
Forget about the girl,
get outta here.


884
01:06:38.473 --> 01:06:40.406
Make this a happy ending.

885
01:06:42.808 --> 01:06:44.374
I'm taking her.

886
01:06:46.175 --> 01:06:47.207
Fine.

887
01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:48.908
Fine, whatever.

888
01:06:50.041 --> 01:06:51.574
Just don't understand why,

889
01:06:51.709 --> 01:06:54.407
why you're so attached
to somebody else's kid.


890
01:06:54.941 --> 01:06:56.507
We're not attached.

891
01:06:56.875 --> 01:06:58.407
<i>She hates me.</i>

892
01:07:07.942 --> 01:07:09.176
What's going on?

893
01:07:09.308 --> 01:07:10.742
Who is that guy?

894
01:07:10.875 --> 01:07:12.641
<i>He's an old friend.</i>

895
01:07:13.742 --> 01:07:15.676
<i>We're going with him.</i>

896
01:07:16.842 --> 01:07:17.909
Put this on
your forehead.


897
01:07:18.042 --> 01:07:19.042
Why?

898
01:07:19.176 --> 01:07:20.208
'Cause you're not well.

899
01:07:20.341 --> 01:07:21.208
Just do it.

900
01:07:21.341 --> 01:07:22.743
Stop!

901
01:07:22.876 --> 01:07:25.776
I can see your fever
from here, please.


902
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:37.642
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

903
01:07:37.776 --> 01:07:39.077
<i>After Sanku's
record-breaking night,</i>


904
01:07:39.209 --> 01:07:40.677
<i>Donald Swanson-</i>

905
01:07:41.876 --> 01:07:43.209
<i>So we can't
leave from Detroit</i>


906
01:07:43.342 --> 01:07:44.643
because there's too
much heat on us.


907
01:07:44.777 --> 01:07:46.342
Fine, fine, I'll get
you as far as Clarkson


908
01:07:46.476 --> 01:07:47.711
and then you guys are on
your own from there, okay?


909
01:07:47.844 --> 01:07:48.944
No, first we need to
go by a drugstore.


910
01:07:49.078 --> 01:07:50.242
But-
- I'm fine.


911
01:07:50.376 --> 01:07:51.977
You're not!

912
01:07:52.111 --> 01:07:53.409
We also need a
car in Clarkson.


913
01:07:53.543 --> 01:07:55.044
Right, right, okay.

914
01:07:55.178 --> 01:07:56.576
I'm gonna hook you up with
a car in Clarkson right now


915
01:07:56.711 --> 01:07:58.111
and let's go,
we'll go right now, okay?


916
01:07:58.243 --> 01:07:59.210
<i>How much?</i>

917
01:07:59.343 --> 01:08:00.243
No, preferred client discount.

918
01:08:00.377 --> 01:08:01.410
How much you want?

919
01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:02.811
I don't want anything,
keep it.


920
01:08:02.944 --> 01:08:04.610
You're gonna need it
when you get there.


921
01:08:10.377 --> 01:08:11.343
- Something's not right.
- Whoa.


922
01:08:11.477 --> 01:08:12.410
Oh, whoa, okay, okay.

923
01:08:12.544 --> 01:08:13.510
What are you doing?

924
01:08:13.645 --> 01:08:15.410
What are you doing-

925
01:08:16.079 --> 01:08:17.845
Keele! Keele?

926
01:08:17.978 --> 01:08:19.812
<i>Couple warmup
pitches as Derrick Graham-</i>


927
01:08:21.012 --> 01:08:22.745
Did you set me up?

928
01:08:23.344 --> 01:08:24.945
After all I've
done for you.


929
01:08:25.079 --> 01:08:27.278
After all we've been through
together, you're not-


930
01:08:27.912 --> 01:08:29.812
<i>Are you really asking
me that question?</i>


931
01:08:29.945 --> 01:08:32.278
You've never done a
favour in your life.


932
01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:38.145
Okay.

933
01:08:38.278 --> 01:08:39.846
Don't move.

934
01:08:42.846 --> 01:08:44.378
No, no.

935
01:08:50.679 --> 01:08:51.846
<i>Oh, fuck, Eli.</i>

936
01:08:52.979 --> 01:08:54.345
You could've got out.

937
01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:55.846
You had a chance to get
out and you didn't go


938
01:08:55.979 --> 01:08:57.979
<i>and that's on you,
man, that's on you!</i>


939
01:08:58.914 --> 01:09:01.980
Okay, why did you get
me involved in this


940
01:09:02.113 --> 01:09:04.114
<i>in the first place?
You pulled me into this!</i>


941
01:09:04.245 --> 01:09:06.714
I was getting a good clean
business going on my own.


942
01:09:06.847 --> 01:09:08.947
You were never clean
in your life, Eli.


943
01:09:09.081 --> 01:09:10.680
Cleanish, cleanish!

944
01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:12.313
You weren't there, okay,
you didn't see him.


945
01:09:12.447 --> 01:09:13.647
You didn't see him,
this guy was crazy.


946
01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:14.747
This guy's crazy!

947
01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.313
<i>And not-not-not
regular crazy,</i>


948
01:09:16.447 --> 01:09:17.614
it's like calm crazy.

949
01:09:17.747 --> 01:09:18.780
It's like the worst
kind of crazy.


950
01:09:18.914 --> 01:09:20.380
How much does he know?

951
01:09:21.014 --> 01:09:22.114
He knows everything, man.

952
01:09:22.246 --> 01:09:23.748
He knows everything,
all right?


953
01:09:23.881 --> 01:09:25.480
<i>He knows about the stash,
he knows about the girl</i>


954
01:09:25.614 --> 01:09:27.548
and your passports.

955
01:09:27.681 --> 01:09:28.815
<i>And-and-and he's
waiting out there</i>


956
01:09:28.948 --> 01:09:30.313
<i>and I'm supposed
to walk you out.</i>


957
01:09:30.447 --> 01:09:31.614
I'm supposed to
walk you out


958
01:09:31.748 --> 01:09:32.781
and then he's gonna
finish you off


959
01:09:32.915 --> 01:09:34.182
but there's two of us

960
01:09:34.314 --> 01:09:35.581
and there's one of him.

961
01:09:35.715 --> 01:09:36.715
There's only one of him,
and if we work together,


962
01:09:36.848 --> 01:09:38.448
if we work
together on this,


963
01:09:38.581 --> 01:09:39.848
we can get outta here.

964
01:09:39.981 --> 01:09:41.314
<i>Hey, man,
it wasn't for nothing,</i>


965
01:09:41.448 --> 01:09:42.481
<i>it wasn't for nothing, okay?</i>

966
01:09:42.615 --> 01:09:44.448
He was gonna kill Myra,

967
01:09:44.582 --> 01:09:46.314
gonna kill her, okay?

968
01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:47.981
<i>And then-then-then-then,</i>

969
01:09:48.115 --> 01:09:49.247
what am I supposed to do?

970
01:09:49.381 --> 01:09:51.016
<i>You woulda done
the same thing,</i>


971
01:09:51.148 --> 01:09:52.049
<i>you woulda done the same,
what are you gonna kill me?</i>


972
01:09:52.182 --> 01:09:53.049
Come on, man.

973
01:09:53.182 --> 01:09:54.049
You gonna kill me, Keele?

974
01:09:54.183 --> 01:09:55.049
You gonna kill me?

975
01:09:55.183 --> 01:09:56.215
You're not gonna kill me.

976
01:09:56.347 --> 01:09:57.782
You're not an asshole,
are you?


977
01:09:57.916 --> 01:09:59.448
I'm not an asshole.

978
01:10:00.315 --> 01:10:02.382
I'm sorry, man, okay?

979
01:10:05.482 --> 01:10:07.248
I'm sorry too.

980
01:10:11.949 --> 01:10:13.516
<i>The ball is
launched into the outfield-</i>


981
01:10:49.984 --> 01:10:51.485
Let's just go.

982
01:10:52.451 --> 01:10:54.618
Wherever you wanna go,
I'll go.


983
01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:57.752
We getting outta here
right now, come on.


984
01:11:02.518 --> 01:11:04.217
We're going out back.

985
01:11:05.217 --> 01:11:06.752
Wait here.

986
01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:28.486
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

987
01:11:45.721 --> 01:11:48.120
You said Eli was a friend.

988
01:11:48.252 --> 01:11:49.787
He was.

989
01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.787
But even friends can turn.

990
01:11:54.352 --> 01:11:56.386
Wait, here.

991
01:11:56.887 --> 01:11:58.188
Take this.

992
01:11:58.319 --> 01:12:00.220
I saved it for you.

993
01:12:14.188 --> 01:12:16.688
Okay, we gotta
get outta here.


994
01:12:17.188 --> 01:12:18.855
Gotta get to Eli's car.

995
01:12:19.822 --> 01:12:22.822
Take this and don't
shoot me with it.


996
01:12:22.955 --> 01:12:25.688
But, but I don't
know how to use it!


997
01:12:26.155 --> 01:12:27.588
There's nothing to it.

998
01:12:27.722 --> 01:12:29.022
You just point it where you
want the bullet to go.


999
01:12:29.155 --> 01:12:30.055
All right?

1000
01:12:30.189 --> 01:12:31.155
You ready?

1001
01:12:31.288 --> 01:12:33.888
No!

1002
01:12:34.022 --> 01:12:35.723
<i>You fucked up, old man.</i>

1003
01:12:39.089 --> 01:12:40.189
<i>You had one job!</i>

1004
01:12:41.321 --> 01:12:42.856
AH!

1005
01:12:46.522 --> 01:12:48.255
All right, take this!

1006
01:12:49.190 --> 01:12:50.255
You're gonna
get in the car-


1007
01:12:50.389 --> 01:12:51.156
What? No.
- And you're gonna go.


1008
01:12:51.289 --> 01:12:52.556
- No!
- Yes.


1009
01:12:52.689 --> 01:12:53.756
No, I can't, I don't
know what I'm doing.


1010
01:12:53.889 --> 01:12:55.490
Yes, you're gonna
go right now.


1011
01:12:55.622 --> 01:12:57.090
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- It's not me, okay?


1012
01:12:57.222 --> 01:12:58.322
What?

1013
01:12:58.457 --> 01:12:59.989
Eli told me.

1014
01:13:02.356 --> 01:13:03.657
Fuck you!

1015
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:05.090
Think about getting
out of here right now


1016
01:13:05.222 --> 01:13:06.255
and that's it,
now let's move!


1017
01:13:07.657 --> 01:13:08.356
<i>Nowhere to hide, Keele!</i>

1018
01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:09.222
Look at me!

1019
01:13:09.356 --> 01:13:10.657
<i>It okay.</i>

1020
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:11.857
Go, go!

1021
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:13.157
All right.

1022
01:13:24.824 --> 01:13:27.223
<i>Come get me,
you fuckin' psycho!</i>


1023
01:15:29.196 --> 01:15:30.329
Don't move.

1024
01:15:39.329 --> 01:15:40.996
Yeah, I learned
all your tricks.


1025
01:15:49.363 --> 01:15:50.930
What a waste.

1026
01:15:51.063 --> 01:15:52.896
<i>You didn't learn this one,
you little prick.</i>


1027
01:16:03.997 --> 01:16:06.231
Ah, not bad.

1028
01:16:07.831 --> 01:16:10.564
I can't wait to get
acquainted with your girl.


1029
01:16:11.298 --> 01:16:13.431
I'll be able to use this to
chop her fuckin' head off.


1030
01:16:27.531 --> 01:16:29.265
<i>Rest easy, old man.</i>

1031
01:16:29.798 --> 01:16:31.631
<i>I'll take good
care of her.</i>


1032
01:16:33.832 --> 01:16:36.232
<i>Oh, shit, you bitch!</i>

1033
01:16:54.532 --> 01:16:55.899
So you're his girl?

1034
01:16:56.033 --> 01:16:57.599
Shut up!

1035
01:16:59.666 --> 01:17:01.533
<i>Hey, Peyton.</i>

1036
01:17:03.999 --> 01:17:05.600
You don't wanna do that.

1037
01:17:05.734 --> 01:17:07.266
<i>Peyton.</i>

1038
01:17:08.567 --> 01:17:10.033
<i>Listen to me, okay?</i>

1039
01:17:11.167 --> 01:17:12.800
You can't undo it.

1040
01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:15.000
He gets what he deserves.

1041
01:17:15.135 --> 01:17:17.000
Hey, listen to me for once!

1042
01:17:18.433 --> 01:17:21.934
That will stick
with you forever.


1043
01:17:23.567 --> 01:17:25.800
You should listen
to the old man.


1044
01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:28.267
Peyton?

1045
01:17:30.634 --> 01:17:32.701
You don't wanna
be like me.


1046
01:17:34.935 --> 01:17:36.434
Gimme the gun.

1047
01:17:43.935 --> 01:17:44.935
No!

1048
01:18:09.969 --> 01:18:11.702
I told you to go.

1049
01:18:59.139 --> 01:19:00.704
Okay.

1050
01:19:08.572 --> 01:19:10.371
I'm okay, I got it.

1051
01:19:10.505 --> 01:19:12.238
Are you sure?

1052
01:19:14.371 --> 01:19:15.905
Well, maybe a little help.

1053
01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:38.040
So, James, how do we
get to Argentina?


1054
01:19:38.473 --> 01:19:40.606
Now you wanna go?

1055
01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:41.873
Of course.

1056
01:19:42.108 --> 01:19:44.439
I've always wanted
to go to Argentina.


1057
01:19:44.573 --> 01:19:46.074
You said you didn't.

1058
01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:48.906
Well, I didn't want
to go with you.


1059
01:19:50.174 --> 01:19:51.740
You do now?

1060
01:19:53.041 --> 01:19:54.607
Yeah.

1061
01:19:57.174 --> 01:19:58.906
But I still hate you.

1062
01:20:00.407 --> 01:20:01.942
I know.

1063
01:20:03.074 --> 01:20:04.208
<i>What about Alaska?</i>

1064
01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:05.707
<i>I hear it's peaceful and-</i>

1065
01:20:06.008 --> 01:20:08.307
<i>You just promised Argentina.</i>

1066
01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:09.707
<i>All right, forget it.</i>

1067
01:20:09.841 --> 01:20:11.707
<i>You know how to
drive, right?</i>


1068
01:20:12.175 --> 01:20:13.142
<i>Ahhhh, yeah.</i>

1069
01:20:13.274 --> 01:20:14.774
<i>Holy Jesus.</i>

1070
01:20:18.209 --> 01:20:20.209
<i>Ugh, this music.</i>

1071
01:21:25.119 --> 01:21:30.119
