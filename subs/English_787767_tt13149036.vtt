2
00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:51.581
Cassidy.

3
00:00:51.648 --> 00:00:53.451
Grandma, is that you?

4
00:00:53.518 --> 00:00:56.591
I-I'm sorry to call you
so early, sugarplum.


5
00:00:56.658 --> 00:00:59.966
- It's okay, Grandma.
- How are you feeling?


6
00:01:00.032 --> 00:01:03.271
Well, I'm gonna die
this weekend.


7
00:01:03.338 --> 00:01:06.211
- Oh.
- And I-I need you to teach me.


8
00:01:06.277 --> 00:01:07.848
Uh...

9
00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:10.219
I-I'm not sure how.
I have never died.


10
00:01:10.285 --> 00:01:11.587
No, not that.

11
00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:15.462
Teach me the Zoom thing
that people use


12
00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:18.535
and gather the family.

13
00:01:18.602 --> 00:01:21.374
In normal times that might be
a difficult request,


14
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.814
but during the pandemic
the Worth family


15
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.386
found a way to come together
while dealing with a crisis.


16
00:01:27.452 --> 00:01:29.826
This is their story.

17
00:01:29.892 --> 00:01:32.396
Cassidy, you wanna join me
in the kitchen?


18
00:01:32.462 --> 00:01:33.531
We can Zoom together?

19
00:01:33.598 --> 00:01:36.138
No way, your lighting sucks.

20
00:01:36.205 --> 00:01:38.175
- Guys.
- Hey, Chad.


21
00:01:38.242 --> 00:01:40.279
- Hi, Chad.
- What's up, man?


22
00:01:40.345 --> 00:01:41.480
There you guys are.

23
00:01:41.547 --> 00:01:43.551
Wish it was
different circumstances.


24
00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.392
Cassidy, wow, let me see
what you got going on there.


25
00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:48.662
That's a lot.

26
00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.201
Yeah, she did the makeup
and hair herself.


27
00:01:51.268 --> 00:01:53.538
I love that.

28
00:01:53.606 --> 00:01:55.676
Hi, everybody,
not all at once, please.


29
00:01:55.743 --> 00:01:57.347
That's your Uncle Bobby,
by the way.


30
00:01:57.412 --> 00:01:59.651
Another example of you just
dropping out of our lives


31
00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:01.088
and coming back in
whenever you feel like it.


32
00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:03.960
Yeah, I just sit here
like Buddha.


33
00:02:04.027 --> 00:02:05.696
Oh, hey, Mom.

34
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.644
- Hello, Bobby.
- Hello, Di-Di.


35
00:02:15.884 --> 00:02:17.552
Hello, family.

36
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.554
- Hello
- Hi.


37
00:02:18.622 --> 00:02:20.660
- Hello.
- Yes, Robert.


38
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.102
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.


39
00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:27.073
What time is it in Russia
right now, man?


40
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.110
- Eight hours.
- Like, it's always been later...


41
00:02:29.177 --> 00:02:30.046
You guys didn't know what

42
00:02:30.112 --> 00:02:31.715
a single one of those words
meant.


43
00:02:31.782 --> 00:02:33.584
Are they still Communists?

44
00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:35.289
Hi. Hi, everybody.

45
00:02:35.356 --> 00:02:37.293
- Hey!
- Hi.


46
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.830
- Hi, Judith.
- How are you?


47
00:02:38.897 --> 00:02:40.199
Hi.

48
00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:43.205
- Okay, am I the last person?
- Am I the last?


49
00:02:43.272 --> 00:02:44.708
- No.
- Definitely, no.


50
00:02:44.774 --> 00:02:46.078
Katie is not there yet.

51
00:02:46.144 --> 00:02:47.982
There's nowhere
with any reception.


52
00:02:48.048 --> 00:02:51.021
I've been trying to find
a place to pull over, but...


53
00:02:51.088 --> 00:02:52.925
- You know, Dorsey...
- Oh, wow, Bobby.


54
00:02:52.992 --> 00:02:54.094
You don't look any different.

55
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.964
I know Katie's gonna be
last this time.


56
00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:57.935
- Of course Katie's last.
- Punctual as always...


57
00:02:58.002 --> 00:02:59.037
Whenever we say last,
we mean...


58
00:02:59.104 --> 00:02:59.939
It's Katie...

59
00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:01.708
- Before Katie...
- Has anybody...


60
00:03:01.775 --> 00:03:03.212
Hey, guys, nominating that
we just one at a time.


61
00:03:03.278 --> 00:03:04.214
Raise your hand and talk. So.

62
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.851
- Okay.
- I'm not gonna raise my hand.


63
00:03:05.917 --> 00:03:07.687
George Burns once wrote

64
00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:10.659
that happiness
is having a large, loving,


65
00:03:10.726 --> 00:03:14.634
caring, close-knit family
in another city.


66
00:03:14.701 --> 00:03:18.042
Well, George Burns
didn't know Zoom.


67
00:03:18.108 --> 00:03:19.744
- You know what we're here for?
- Like a family does...


68
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:22.116
Let's think about
what we're here for.


69
00:03:22.183 --> 00:03:25.857
- True.
- Where-where is Mother?


70
00:03:25.924 --> 00:03:28.195
- Yeah, where is...
- Oh, good. You're all here.


71
00:03:28.262 --> 00:03:29.798
Great.

72
00:03:29.865 --> 00:03:34.274
I'm going to set this up
so you can see Mabel.


73
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.413
Just a heads up, she is
in and out of consciousness,


74
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.223
so do not expect her to respond,
but she can hear you.


75
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.294
Studies have shown
that she can...


76
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.266
she can hear, so don't be shy,

77
00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:48.635
but also don't be too loud

78
00:03:48.702 --> 00:03:54.280
because you are a big bunch, and
we want her passing to be calm.


79
00:03:54.347 --> 00:03:57.888
- You hear that, Bret, right?
- That's a lot of instructions.


80
00:03:57.955 --> 00:04:00.426
- Hi, Mom.
- Mom, there you are.


81
00:04:00.493 --> 00:04:02.130
- Hello.
- There you are.


82
00:04:02.196 --> 00:04:04.167
- Grandma, I'm here.
- It's Dorsey. I'm here...


83
00:04:04.234 --> 00:04:05.236
We're actually all here,
not just Dorsey.


84
00:04:05.302 --> 00:04:06.338
Katie's not here,
but I'm here.


85
00:04:06.404 --> 00:04:07.273
Hi, Grandma.

86
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.144
Right here, Grandma,
it's Chad.


87
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.381
Hi y'all.

88
00:04:11.448 --> 00:04:12.783
Good to see you.

89
00:04:14.622 --> 00:04:16.993
Welcome to my death.

90
00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:19.030
We love you so much.

91
00:04:19.097 --> 00:04:20.499
Dorsey, pull it together.

92
00:04:20.566 --> 00:04:21.902
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hi, Mom.


93
00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:23.572
You know, you look serene.

94
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.914
Looks like you can take that
"coming soon" sign off my grave.


95
00:04:27.981 --> 00:04:30.853
- Mom.
- Grandma, don't.


96
00:04:30.921 --> 00:04:33.559
- It's true.
- We're all here with you.


97
00:04:33.626 --> 00:04:37.166
- You're in Connecticut.
- I mean in our hearts, Mother.


98
00:04:37.233 --> 00:04:40.773
I'm sorry we're not there
with you.


99
00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:43.745
Okay, so just remember

100
00:04:43.812 --> 00:04:46.686
that Mabel
is doing the work right now.


101
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:48.222
She's concentrating.

102
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:52.363
So while encouragement is okay,
silence...


103
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.536
is actually perfect.

104
00:04:55.604 --> 00:04:56.905
Okay?

105
00:04:56.973 --> 00:04:59.143
- What is that mean?
- What does what mean?


106
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.813
Encouragement to do what?

107
00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:03.151
- To just go.
- How do you do this?


108
00:05:03.218 --> 00:05:05.389
Are we supposed
to say, like, it's okay?


109
00:05:05.456 --> 00:05:08.161
Like, are we supposed to say,
"It's okay, you can die now"?


110
00:05:08.228 --> 00:05:09.297
- No.
- Probably, I don't know.


111
00:05:09.364 --> 00:05:11.201
No, we're just supposed
to be supportive.


112
00:05:11.268 --> 00:05:14.675
Just letting her know
we all gathered...


113
00:05:14.742 --> 00:05:16.444
Bobby, with all due respect,
I don't wanna hear


114
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:18.415
about being here from you, okay?

115
00:05:18.482 --> 00:05:20.886
That was encouragement?

116
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.558
Huh.

117
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.174
Do you remember the time
we, uh,


118
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:33.979
we used to play music
on Grandma's porch?


119
00:05:34.047 --> 00:05:37.386
She'd-she'd also sing
and dance, as I remember.


120
00:05:37.453 --> 00:05:38.656
I do remember.

121
00:05:38.723 --> 00:05:41.328
Eating those biscuits,
those biscuits with grain.


122
00:05:41.394 --> 00:05:44.133
- And your gas afterwards.
- Yeah, we all remember that too.


123
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.637
Thank you for bringing
that up.


124
00:05:45.704 --> 00:05:47.173
And remember when
we'd go down to that bar,


125
00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:51.348
and she got up on the...
on the bar and danced.


126
00:05:51.414 --> 00:05:52.850
Oh, my God.

127
00:05:52.917 --> 00:05:54.020
She kicked every glass
off that bar.


128
00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:55.022
Oh, my mother.

129
00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:56.991
Hey, Max?

130
00:06:06.645 --> 00:06:08.081
What is that noise?

131
00:06:08.148 --> 00:06:09.651
It's the death rattle.

132
00:06:09.718 --> 00:06:11.019
That's her soul

133
00:06:11.087 --> 00:06:12.256
- trying to say goodbye.
- Is that it?


134
00:06:12.323 --> 00:06:15.028
- It's not her...
- Oh, my God.


135
00:06:17.768 --> 00:06:23.245
Everyone, I know that this
is hard, but this is normal.


136
00:06:23.311 --> 00:06:27.286
I want you to know that Mabel
is not experiencing any pain.


137
00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:30.259
I administered morphine
a little while ago.


138
00:06:30.325 --> 00:06:33.231
But hang in there, guys.
You're doing great.


139
00:06:35.102 --> 00:06:38.208
You know, the Buddhists
believe that their soul


140
00:06:38.275 --> 00:06:40.647
always remains with the family.

141
00:06:49.932 --> 00:06:52.737
- Oh.
- Goodbye, Mom.


142
00:06:52.804 --> 00:06:54.340
Wait? Did she die?

143
00:06:56.745 --> 00:07:00.519
Did she die? Is she dead?

144
00:07:02.156 --> 00:07:03.391
Wait, did she die?

145
00:07:05.996 --> 00:07:07.199
- Fuck!
- Bye, Mom.


146
00:07:07.266 --> 00:07:08.235
Wait, did she die?

147
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:09.570
I can't believe
we're not there.


148
00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:12.309
- This is so fucked up!
- We should be with her.


149
00:07:12.376 --> 00:07:13.578
There are a lot
of instructions, and you're not


150
00:07:13.646 --> 00:07:15.047
listening to any of them,
Dorsey.


151
00:07:15.115 --> 00:07:16.317
God damn it, Bret!

152
00:07:16.384 --> 00:07:18.656
- This is so stupid!
- This is so fucked!


153
00:07:18.723 --> 00:07:21.361
We should be there!

154
00:07:21.427 --> 00:07:23.699
Do we know yet if she died?

155
00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:28.508
Why aren't we there?

156
00:07:28.575 --> 00:07:30.847
Okay, just
a little bit quieter.


157
00:07:30.914 --> 00:07:32.048
A little bit quieter.

158
00:07:32.116 --> 00:07:33.686
We can hear you.
She can hear you.


159
00:07:39.163 --> 00:07:42.570
- Grandma?
- Where are you going, Max?


160
00:07:46.344 --> 00:07:48.950
- Look, we get it. We get it.
- You're both the saddest.


161
00:07:49.016 --> 00:07:51.454
Grandma!

162
00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:55.997
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.


163
00:07:56.064 --> 00:07:57.266
Oh, no Grandma.

164
00:07:57.333 --> 00:07:58.535
- Grandma you can go...
- Go and join Dad.


165
00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:00.238
- It's okay.
- Bye-bye, Grandma.


166
00:08:00.305 --> 00:08:03.144
Have a celestial journey.

167
00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:04.748
- It's okay.
- We're here with you.


168
00:08:04.815 --> 00:08:05.750
Sleep, Mama.

169
00:08:05.817 --> 00:08:08.221
- It's okay, sweetheart.
- You can go.


170
00:08:08.288 --> 00:08:11.227
I know I can go now.

171
00:08:11.294 --> 00:08:14.300
Don't give me advice.

172
00:08:14.367 --> 00:08:16.270
Bunch of know-it-alls.

173
00:08:21.247 --> 00:08:22.416
I missed it?

174
00:08:22.483 --> 00:08:24.655
Did-did I miss it?
Is she fucking dead?


175
00:08:24.721 --> 00:08:26.692
Did I miss it?
How come I didn't get the link?


176
00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:28.963
- Shh.
- I've been texting you, Mama.


177
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.098
Stop, stop you missed...

178
00:08:30.165 --> 00:08:33.438
yeah, I think you did miss it.

179
00:08:33.505 --> 00:08:35.743
- I don't know.
- Where have you been?


180
00:08:37.847 --> 00:08:42.624
- Oh, thank God. Oh, my God.
- I really thought that I...


181
00:08:42.691 --> 00:08:44.695
Here we go.

182
00:09:03.866 --> 00:09:07.674
I am going to leave this
connected for a few minutes.


183
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:10.278
I just wanted to convey
my condolences.


184
00:09:10.345 --> 00:09:11.547
I'm so sorry.

185
00:09:11.615 --> 00:09:15.623
Mabel was such
a sweet, sweet woman.


186
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.430
A great soul
with a twisted sense of humor.


187
00:09:19.497 --> 00:09:22.503
- Yeah.
- Which I like.


188
00:10:14.974 --> 00:10:16.878
Cass, hon.

189
00:10:19.917 --> 00:10:21.354
You just wanna sit with her
for a while?


190
00:10:21.419 --> 00:10:23.023
Yeah. Yeah.

191
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.898
I'll just sit with her
until the free session runs out.


192
00:10:28.835 --> 00:10:32.709
Okay. Okay, you do that.

193
00:10:32.776 --> 00:10:34.613
I'll make
your favorite spaghetti, okay?


194
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.182
You just come down
when it's over.


195
00:10:39.022 --> 00:10:43.063
Cass? Oh, sorry.

196
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.069
I-I thought the screen
had frozen.


197
00:10:46.136 --> 00:10:49.509
You were both just so still,
you and Gigi.


198
00:10:51.479 --> 00:10:53.751
Look just, um...

199
00:10:56.523 --> 00:10:58.493
Forget it. Love you, kid.

200
00:11:15.395 --> 00:11:17.366
I brought you some spaghetti.

201
00:11:17.432 --> 00:11:20.537
I'm still with Gigi.

202
00:11:20.605 --> 00:11:22.241
How has it not expired yet?

203
00:11:22.308 --> 00:11:25.547
I took your credit card
and bought a premium session.


204
00:11:27.084 --> 00:11:29.490
Okay.

205
00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:31.059
Do you want the spaghetti
or not?


206
00:11:31.126 --> 00:11:35.802
Yes, I want the spaghetti,
and I want you not to be there.


207
00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.923
Have you seen the girl

208
00:12:02.989 --> 00:12:07.766
with the mind on fire?

209
00:12:09.335 --> 00:12:15.815
She set out to tell the world
how they suppress our desires


210
00:12:18.955 --> 00:12:23.931
- Maybe yes. Uh, maybe no.
- Definitely no.


211
00:12:23.998 --> 00:12:28.273
My mother died yesterday,
and I'm-I'm a little scattered.


212
00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:32.582
How do you spend the first day
without someone you love?


213
00:12:32.649 --> 00:12:35.387
Especially when you...
you can't be with your family


214
00:12:35.455 --> 00:12:39.796
to share the memories
and the love they created.


215
00:12:39.863 --> 00:12:41.366
Let me know
if there's anything I can do.


216
00:12:41.433 --> 00:12:45.340
- No, just let's...
- let's continue the meeting.


217
00:12:49.617 --> 00:12:54.960
- Hey, Max? Max?
- What?


218
00:12:55.027 --> 00:12:57.899
You don't even seem upset.

219
00:12:57.966 --> 00:12:59.302
I don't know.

220
00:13:04.312 --> 00:13:05.280
Yeah.

221
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.224
Autumn Care of Nash,
this is Kelly.


222
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.495
Hi, Kelly, this is
Judith Joiner.


223
00:13:12.562 --> 00:13:14.499
I
-I'm Mabel Worth's wife.

224
00:13:14.566 --> 00:13:16.302
- Okay.
- We met on Zoom.


225
00:13:16.369 --> 00:13:18.340
I'm interested in getting
Mabel's things


226
00:13:18.406 --> 00:13:20.511
sent to me
here in New York City,


227
00:13:20.578 --> 00:13:23.049
and I'm just checking to see
that you have my address.


228
00:13:23.116 --> 00:13:25.623
Mabel, right, uh.

229
00:13:25.689 --> 00:13:29.195
I believe you were not
listed as next of kin, Judith.


230
00:13:29.262 --> 00:13:30.965
Okay, that,
that doesn't make sense.


231
00:13:31.032 --> 00:13:32.802
Can you just check
the list again, please?


232
00:13:32.869 --> 00:13:35.040
- I'm sorry.
- I-I don't have you listed.


233
00:13:35.107 --> 00:13:37.946
Okay, can you tell me
what's going on with her body?


234
00:13:38.013 --> 00:13:40.384
Where is she
and what are the plans here?


235
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:44.358
I'm so sorry, Judith, but
Mabel made her own arrangements.


236
00:13:44.425 --> 00:13:46.095
Why can't you tell me
what they are?


237
00:13:46.162 --> 00:13:48.366
It's not a lot of...
I'm not asking for a lot here.


238
00:13:48.433 --> 00:13:49.704
Just where is she?

239
00:13:49.771 --> 00:13:52.542
All I can say is that they are
coming to get her body soon,


240
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:54.378
and let me know if I can...

241
00:13:54.445 --> 00:13:56.015
if there's anything else
I can do for you.


242
00:13:56.082 --> 00:14:00.123
- Yep, yep, yep.
- Thank you very much.


243
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.328
- I just put bagel...
- are you there?


244
00:14:02.394 --> 00:14:04.933
- Sorry, I just look...
- I know I look like a mess.


245
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.104
Yeah, I didn't wanna say
anything. What's up?


246
00:14:07.171 --> 00:14:09.041
I'm trying to make
Grandma's biscuits.


247
00:14:09.108 --> 00:14:11.379
I mean, you know
I gotta stay busy when I'm sad.


248
00:14:11.446 --> 00:14:12.448
Where are you?

249
00:14:12.515 --> 00:14:13.350
Uh, I don't know.

250
00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:15.622
I think I'm in Arizona,
actually.


251
00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:17.191
Your kitchen looks really nice.

252
00:14:17.257 --> 00:14:19.563
How much did Grandma spend
on that remodel?


253
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.766
Well, Kevin did most of it.

254
00:14:20.833 --> 00:14:22.434
I mean, you should see
the garage.


255
00:14:22.501 --> 00:14:24.238
He just changed everything
to kind of like a...


256
00:14:24.305 --> 00:14:27.946
a man cave, and he calls it
his Garage Mahal.


257
00:14:28.012 --> 00:14:29.950
He is so funny, you know.

258
00:14:30.016 --> 00:14:33.156
So listen, I've been trying
to kinda get a poll, you know,


259
00:14:33.223 --> 00:14:35.829
as to what grandma Mabel
would want.


260
00:14:35.895 --> 00:14:37.999
Okay, well, I can do that.

261
00:14:38.066 --> 00:14:39.502
I can just... who, like...

262
00:14:39.569 --> 00:14:41.472
just let me know who you haven't
reached yet and I'll just...


263
00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.942
Oh, no, I don't need you
to take over. No, no, no.


264
00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:45.313
I was just saying that's what
I'm doing and I've got my list...


265
00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.050
Well, I just, you know, like

266
00:14:47.117 --> 00:14:48.253
I don't really like
feeling out of the loop


267
00:14:48.319 --> 00:14:50.490
and I mean, you know, how...

268
00:14:50.558 --> 00:14:53.229
I just, like, wanna...
just one of those times


269
00:14:53.296 --> 00:14:56.035
I wish I still lived
in Spring Hope.


270
00:14:56.102 --> 00:14:57.371
Oh, really?

271
00:14:57.438 --> 00:14:58.608
This is when you wish
you lived here?


272
00:14:58.675 --> 00:15:00.343
No, you did it right.

273
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.082
You left.
We don't need your help now.


274
00:15:03.149 --> 00:15:05.086
I mean,
I could have used it before.


275
00:15:05.153 --> 00:15:07.424
I'm just gonna ignore
that dig...


276
00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:08.961
Just trying to kinda
figure out everything


277
00:15:09.028 --> 00:15:10.965
for the digital memorial, and...

278
00:15:11.032 --> 00:15:12.468
I'd really love to still try

279
00:15:12.534 --> 00:15:14.004
to do,
like, an in-person funeral.


280
00:15:14.071 --> 00:15:16.409
I really think we should do
something really traditional.


281
00:15:16.476 --> 00:15:17.780
So you're gonna come home
for this?


282
00:15:17.847 --> 00:15:19.181
You're gonna come home for this?

283
00:15:19.248 --> 00:15:20.517
Yeah, she would want us
all to be together.


284
00:15:20.585 --> 00:15:22.087
She would have wanted us
to be together


285
00:15:22.154 --> 00:15:23.556
a little bit more
before she died.


286
00:15:23.625 --> 00:15:24.727
I mean, Katie, I think
a lot of times


287
00:15:24.794 --> 00:15:26.295
when stuff like this happens,
like,


288
00:15:26.362 --> 00:15:28.333
you start to understand,
like, what's really important...


289
00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:29.804
Let's keep thinking about it.

290
00:15:29.871 --> 00:15:31.774
Let's just... let's just keep
talking and keep thinking.


291
00:15:31.841 --> 00:15:33.812
How's Max doing?

292
00:15:33.879 --> 00:15:35.849
He's doing great, actually.

293
00:15:35.916 --> 00:15:38.855
This time has been
really good for us, I think.


294
00:15:38.922 --> 00:15:40.056
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

295
00:15:40.123 --> 00:15:41.895
Yeah, I mean, it's been hard
for him.


296
00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:43.129
It's hard for all the kids.
I mean, it's hard...


297
00:15:43.196 --> 00:15:44.265
Yeah, that's what I thought,

298
00:15:44.331 --> 00:15:45.467
that's what I thought,
kinda hard.


299
00:15:45.534 --> 00:15:46.704
That's like really
passive aggressive,


300
00:15:46.771 --> 00:15:47.940
what you're saying.
Why don't you just come


301
00:15:48.007 --> 00:15:49.575
right out and say what
you think?


302
00:15:49.644 --> 00:15:52.581
Okay, I don't think that you
should have taken a teenager


303
00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:55.053
who is going through a global
pandemic across the country.


304
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.693
I just think it's insane,
to be honest.


305
00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.094
I-I just want you to focus
on your family


306
00:15:59.161 --> 00:16:00.597
and just focus on you.

307
00:16:00.666 --> 00:16:01.901
You've-you've never had
a problem


308
00:16:01.968 --> 00:16:03.403
doing that in the past?

309
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:05.876
Uh.

310
00:16:05.943 --> 00:16:07.612
All right, Max is coming back
with snacks,


311
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.750
so, uh,
I think I'm gonna go now.


312
00:16:09.817 --> 00:16:12.588
I feel like, yeah.

313
00:16:12.656 --> 00:16:13.692
- Okay, I didn't mean to be...
- So I'll just stop...


314
00:16:13.758 --> 00:16:15.027
I didn't mean
to be rude, okay?...


315
00:16:15.093 --> 00:16:16.295
- No, it's fine...
- You just ran off...


316
00:16:16.362 --> 00:16:17.733
- It's fine. It's fine.
- You know what, it's fine.


317
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.971
I know you have all of your
opinions and since, you know,


318
00:16:20.037 --> 00:16:22.810
you and I haven't really kept
in touch that well lately,


319
00:16:22.876 --> 00:16:24.714
I don't really expect you
to know what I'm going through.


320
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.282
So I'm just gonna...

321
00:16:26.349 --> 00:16:27.953
I'll take off, and, you know,
I'm here if you need me.


322
00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.991
Come on. Dorsey.

323
00:16:30.057 --> 00:16:31.425
Bye.

324
00:16:31.492 --> 00:16:34.667
God damn it.

325
00:16:34.734 --> 00:16:37.806
Yeah, I don't know why my mom
has us on some stupid road trip


326
00:16:37.873 --> 00:16:39.475
in stupid Arizona.

327
00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:41.245
I think she's trying
to get us out of the house,


328
00:16:41.312 --> 00:16:44.987
but now we're
in a smaller house on wheels.


329
00:16:45.054 --> 00:16:46.589
What the hell is wrong
with me?


330
00:16:46.658 --> 00:16:47.893
Except for Katie.

331
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.330
I hope she chokes someone
in those goddamn biscuits.


332
00:16:50.397 --> 00:16:51.968
No one makes them
like Grandma did.


333
00:16:52.035 --> 00:16:53.269
No one. I hate this RV.

334
00:16:53.336 --> 00:16:54.505
Oh my God, Cassidy,
my mom is glitching.


335
00:16:54.571 --> 00:16:56.308
- I hate this year!
- Look at this.


336
00:16:56.375 --> 00:16:57.511
I think my mom is having
a meltdown.


337
00:16:57.577 --> 00:16:58.915
- Max, not now.
- I need some alone time.


338
00:16:58.982 --> 00:17:00.383
You clearly haven't seen
my dad when he has a meltdown.


339
00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.220
Max, knock it off. I mean it.

340
00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:03.189
Dude, she's being normal,
stop.


341
00:17:03.256 --> 00:17:04.927
- Stop.
- Leave her alone.


342
00:17:04.994 --> 00:17:06.964
What are you doing? Go, go.

343
00:17:08.634 --> 00:17:10.336
During these unique times,

344
00:17:10.403 --> 00:17:12.710
more people rely
on the gig economy


345
00:17:12.776 --> 00:17:14.714
to support themselves
and their families.


346
00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.853
- Hey, there, Judy?
- Judith.


347
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.890
- Okay, well, I think...
- I think I found the place.


348
00:17:19.957 --> 00:17:23.030
We're talking about the
Autumn Care of Nash


349
00:17:23.097 --> 00:17:24.331
nursing home, right?

350
00:17:24.398 --> 00:17:26.771
- Yes, yes.
- That's it. That's right.


351
00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:31.848
Jessica, a Tasker,
took that to an extreme.


352
00:17:31.914 --> 00:17:35.187
Okay, so do you... do you want
take a screenshot


353
00:17:35.253 --> 00:17:36.388
or do you want me to do that?

354
00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:38.359
Look, just-just do
what you're doing.


355
00:17:38.426 --> 00:17:41.834
- And so it seems to Judith.
- What?


356
00:17:41.901 --> 00:17:44.538
Okay, the task I hired

357
00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:47.612
a Task Rabbit
to do is to provide me


358
00:17:47.678 --> 00:17:52.956
with an ongoing live stream
of a particular building, yeah?


359
00:17:53.023 --> 00:17:55.094
Okay, but for how long?

360
00:17:55.161 --> 00:17:56.731
Indeterminate.

361
00:17:56.798 --> 00:17:58.700
Wow, okay.

362
00:17:58.768 --> 00:18:01.039
What if I have to pee
or eat or sleep?


363
00:18:01.106 --> 00:18:02.910
I have... I have kids.

364
00:18:02.976 --> 00:18:05.614
Can you just, just...

365
00:18:07.986 --> 00:18:10.124
Yeah, that's it.

366
00:18:11.761 --> 00:18:13.596
My wife died in there.

367
00:18:15.567 --> 00:18:17.337
From COVID?

368
00:18:17.404 --> 00:18:22.447
- No, she was in her 90s.
- Old age, I guess.


369
00:18:22.514 --> 00:18:25.989
Whoa. Sorry for your loss.

370
00:18:26.056 --> 00:18:27.625
Thank you.

371
00:18:27.692 --> 00:18:29.696
I just thought it was
from the virus


372
00:18:29.763 --> 00:18:32.702
'cause, you know,
it's so common these days.


373
00:18:32.769 --> 00:18:35.007
Didn't feel common.

374
00:18:35.074 --> 00:18:36.743
No, I mean,

375
00:18:36.811 --> 00:18:38.647
it's really fucking intense
to watch a person die,


376
00:18:38.714 --> 00:18:39.950
don't get me wrong.

377
00:18:40.017 --> 00:18:41.653
I one time watched, like,

378
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.491
three of my cousins,
like, blow up.


379
00:18:44.558 --> 00:18:46.730
We were on a... on a jet boat,

380
00:18:46.797 --> 00:18:48.532
and the thing just like exploded

381
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.373
into a fireball right
in front of us.


382
00:18:51.438 --> 00:18:53.978
Okay, stop talking,
Task Rabbit.


383
00:19:01.091 --> 00:19:03.461
Perfect.

384
00:19:03.528 --> 00:19:05.432
Just like that.

385
00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:20.229
Hey, guys.

386
00:19:20.296 --> 00:19:22.233
- Hey.
- Oh.


387
00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.039
Hey, Katie, are you doing
some modelling on the side?


388
00:19:25.106 --> 00:19:26.308
I don't think the light's
big enough


389
00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:28.713
to... to get rid of the lines.

390
00:19:28.779 --> 00:19:30.183
- Can't hear you.
- Oh, come on Katie.


391
00:19:30.249 --> 00:19:31.251
We can't hear you...

392
00:19:31.318 --> 00:19:34.291
- Bummer.
- Turn your mic on.


393
00:19:34.358 --> 00:19:35.525
Damn it, my mic wasn't on.

394
00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:36.830
I know none of you care
about your looks,


395
00:19:36.896 --> 00:19:38.565
but I pride myself
on my appearance,


396
00:19:38.632 --> 00:19:40.535
and I'm sorry that you don't.

397
00:19:40.603 --> 00:19:41.906
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you, Mama.


398
00:19:41.973 --> 00:19:43.642
- You know what?
- You know what else is gorgeous?


399
00:19:43.709 --> 00:19:45.512
Inner beauty. Just inner beauty.

400
00:19:45.579 --> 00:19:47.717
Let your... let your soul
shine through.


401
00:19:47.784 --> 00:19:48.987
You have inner beauty, Bret.

402
00:19:49.054 --> 00:19:51.025
- He doesn't have either...
- inner nor outer.


403
00:19:51.091 --> 00:19:54.231
I don't need a ring light
to let my beauty shine through.


404
00:19:54.297 --> 00:19:56.035
- You sure about that?
- Oh, my kids.


405
00:19:56.101 --> 00:19:58.472
- Are we all here?
- No.


406
00:19:58.538 --> 00:20:00.643
- Where's Chad?
- We're waiting on Chad.


407
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:02.113
- Hello?
- Hey.


408
00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.618
- Hey, guys. Wow.
- Look at everybody.


409
00:20:04.684 --> 00:20:06.455
Jesus, Katie,
you look blown out.


410
00:20:06.522 --> 00:20:08.259
- What?
- Uh, sorry, guys.


411
00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:11.131
I had some book stuff going on.
I had oversee it.


412
00:20:11.198 --> 00:20:12.767
Oh, I thought you were
trying out


413
00:20:12.834 --> 00:20:14.471
for the next season
of "The Vikings,"


414
00:20:14.538 --> 00:20:15.773
or whatever that show was on.

415
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.610
- Very good.
- That's a beard burn.


416
00:20:17.677 --> 00:20:18.846
Well, you know,
everybody's made


417
00:20:18.914 --> 00:20:20.483
sacrifices during the pandemic.

418
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:21.752
That's for sure.

419
00:20:21.819 --> 00:20:23.588
- And you sacrificed your looks?
- He sacrificed.


420
00:20:23.656 --> 00:20:25.961
He's completely hell-bent now.

421
00:20:26.028 --> 00:20:27.596
- Is this what we're doing?
- Is this what we're doing?


422
00:20:27.664 --> 00:20:29.501
'Cause I actually...
I have stuff I could do.


423
00:20:29.568 --> 00:20:31.071
Hey, that looks
like Granddad's mug.


424
00:20:31.138 --> 00:20:32.273
Hey, Chad.

425
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.709
Did you bring that to Russia
with you?


426
00:20:33.776 --> 00:20:35.313
Does it? Don't think so.

427
00:20:35.379 --> 00:20:36.882
- A little bit.
- Hold it up to the camera.


428
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.018
I don't think so.

429
00:20:38.085 --> 00:20:40.356
Chad talking about unkind.

430
00:20:40.423 --> 00:20:42.026
That comment you made before

431
00:20:42.093 --> 00:20:44.531
about my showing
or not showing up,


432
00:20:44.599 --> 00:20:48.372
I really took offense to that.

433
00:20:48.439 --> 00:20:49.609
Okay.

434
00:20:49.674 --> 00:20:51.445
Okay?

435
00:20:51.512 --> 00:20:52.847
Yeah.

436
00:20:52.915 --> 00:20:55.353
Can we please get back
to discussing the funeral?


437
00:20:55.419 --> 00:20:57.625
- Thank you, darling. Thank you.
- Thank you, Mama.


438
00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.361
Alex from the funeral home,

439
00:20:59.427 --> 00:21:01.064
he is gonna be
joining us shortly.


440
00:21:01.131 --> 00:21:02.767
- Wonderful.
- He's a very nice man.


441
00:21:02.834 --> 00:21:04.404
I've got a huge itinerary
for us,


442
00:21:04.471 --> 00:21:07.243
so we're gonna have
to move, move, move.


443
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:08.579
Oh, hello, family.

444
00:21:08.647 --> 00:21:09.714
Hi, Alex.

445
00:21:09.781 --> 00:21:11.084
- Hi, Alex.
- Hey, Alex.


446
00:21:11.151 --> 00:21:13.322
Sorry about that.

447
00:21:13.389 --> 00:21:14.591
Ooh, ooh. Al?

448
00:21:14.659 --> 00:21:16.461
- Can you hear him?
- I'm having a little trouble.


449
00:21:16.528 --> 00:21:17.463
While he's figuring that out,

450
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:19.534
I just wanna say I am so happy

451
00:21:19.602 --> 00:21:23.742
that Mom did not die of COVID.

452
00:21:23.809 --> 00:21:25.046
That she went peacefully.

453
00:21:25.112 --> 00:21:26.548
She died either way.

454
00:21:26.616 --> 00:21:27.750
Thanks for...

455
00:21:27.817 --> 00:21:28.819
Should we help him
or something?


456
00:21:28.886 --> 00:21:30.223
- Can't hear you.
- Restart the Zoom.


457
00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:32.327
Go to the settings and turn
on and off the audio.


458
00:21:32.393 --> 00:21:34.497
- It's working...
- Settings on and off!


459
00:21:34.564 --> 00:21:35.634
- Stop yelling.
- Robert?


460
00:21:35.701 --> 00:21:37.337
- Screaming doesn't help.
- Oh, dear Lord.


461
00:21:37.403 --> 00:21:38.673
Okay, how's-how's that?

462
00:21:38.739 --> 00:21:40.343
- Okay, yes, you're there.
- Yes. Good.


463
00:21:40.409 --> 00:21:42.313
- That's better.
- You're welcome, guys.


464
00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.582
Thank you.

465
00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:45.353
Again, my name is Alex,

466
00:21:45.419 --> 00:21:49.194
and I'm the manager here
at Cornerstone Funeral Home.


467
00:21:49.261 --> 00:21:52.033
Shall we get down
to the business of bereavement?


468
00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.603
Great.

469
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:55.873
Let's discuss everything

470
00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.279
that Mabel wanted
from this event.


471
00:21:58.345 --> 00:22:00.116
Okay can I... can I just
stop you right there?


472
00:22:00.182 --> 00:22:02.820
I'm just wondering if...

473
00:22:02.887 --> 00:22:04.524
like, is event the right word?

474
00:22:04.591 --> 00:22:06.395
Only because "event"
makes me think of celebration.


475
00:22:06.461 --> 00:22:08.032
Celebration makes me think
of something...


476
00:22:08.098 --> 00:22:09.401
I'm just saying
it makes me think


477
00:22:09.467 --> 00:22:10.903
of birthday parties
or graduations


478
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:12.974
or, you know, like a prom.

479
00:22:13.042 --> 00:22:15.279
You're looking at it wrong,
right Alex?


480
00:22:15.346 --> 00:22:16.348
- Well, you know, uh.
- Celebration of...


481
00:22:16.415 --> 00:22:17.618
All families
grieve differently.


482
00:22:17.685 --> 00:22:18.819
Yeah.

483
00:22:18.886 --> 00:22:20.056
Please can we just go on
with this?


484
00:22:20.122 --> 00:22:21.291
- Yeah, sure.
- Yes, abs... thank you, Mama.


485
00:22:21.358 --> 00:22:23.095
I think personally that I know
exactly


486
00:22:23.162 --> 00:22:26.301
what Grandma wanted
for the service,


487
00:22:26.368 --> 00:22:28.038
- so I can dive right in.
- I know what she wanted too.


488
00:22:28.105 --> 00:22:29.541
I talked to her, too,
so I'm pretty prepared.


489
00:22:29.608 --> 00:22:31.345
And I knew too because
I had talked to her a bunch.


490
00:22:31.411 --> 00:22:32.547
So I've got some notes
right here.


491
00:22:32.614 --> 00:22:34.117
Yeah, I talked to her
a few days ago.


492
00:22:34.184 --> 00:22:35.319
I talked to her too
about a day ago.


493
00:22:35.386 --> 00:22:37.123
- Please, girls.
- I can't take this today.


494
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:38.258
I was also texting with Kelly.

495
00:22:38.325 --> 00:22:40.463
- Not today.
- I can't hear it today.


496
00:22:40.529 --> 00:22:43.469
So first, well, I think what
we're gonna wanna do is,


497
00:22:43.535 --> 00:22:46.174
we're gonna decide
who is writing the obit.


498
00:22:46.241 --> 00:22:47.711
I should write the obituary.

499
00:22:47.778 --> 00:22:49.881
Alex, I don't... have you had
a chance to read my book?


500
00:22:49.948 --> 00:22:51.118
- I have not.
- Oh, come on.


501
00:22:53.589 --> 00:22:55.593
Second,
we'll get into the flowers.


502
00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.263
I will handle the flowers.

503
00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.401
- Thank you, Judith.
- Thanks, Judith.


504
00:22:59.467 --> 00:23:02.875
And then third, we'll get down
to the digital memorial service.


505
00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.411
Just seems so cold.

506
00:23:04.477 --> 00:23:06.749
- Mom, it's-it's the world.
- It's where we are now.


507
00:23:06.816 --> 00:23:08.185
Oh, you know, actually,
there's a lot we can do now


508
00:23:08.252 --> 00:23:12.025
digitally and remotely
that doesn't take away


509
00:23:12.093 --> 00:23:13.462
from the experience of-of...

510
00:23:13.529 --> 00:23:15.099
and the intimacy of
the experience as well.


511
00:23:15.166 --> 00:23:16.401
I mean,
I have been having therapy


512
00:23:16.468 --> 00:23:18.272
over Zoom since it all started,

513
00:23:18.338 --> 00:23:20.677
and it's-it's working for me.

514
00:23:20.744 --> 00:23:23.949
That is one over-share there.

515
00:23:24.016 --> 00:23:25.419
In your opinion, I guess.

516
00:23:25.486 --> 00:23:28.459
- I could never do therapy.
- It's so much lying.


517
00:23:28.525 --> 00:23:29.862
Lying?

518
00:23:29.929 --> 00:23:31.465
I'm not gonna tell a stranger
any of my real secrets,


519
00:23:31.531 --> 00:23:32.533
so I'd be lying.

520
00:23:32.601 --> 00:23:33.603
Well, you don't need therapy
because


521
00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.506
you-you...
you're never gonna have it.


522
00:23:35.573 --> 00:23:37.376
- Oh, why?
- Because she's perfect.


523
00:23:37.443 --> 00:23:39.247
Katie's so perfect, isn't she?

524
00:23:39.314 --> 00:23:40.282
Come on, no one's perfect.

525
00:23:40.349 --> 00:23:41.919
- Thank you, Mama.
- Thank you, Mama.


526
00:23:41.985 --> 00:23:44.991
Okay, let's talk about
what we'd like Grandma to wear.


527
00:23:45.058 --> 00:23:46.194
I think we need to make sure

528
00:23:46.261 --> 00:23:47.931
that she's buried
in her blue nightgown.


529
00:23:47.997 --> 00:23:49.434
- Yeah.
- She loved blue.


530
00:23:49.501 --> 00:23:50.904
She doesn't care
what she is buried in.


531
00:23:50.971 --> 00:23:51.873
- Yeah.
- Was her favorite color.


532
00:23:51.939 --> 00:23:53.375
She loved that blue nightgown.

533
00:23:53.442 --> 00:23:54.745
I don't really don't have
a strong opinion about that, so.


534
00:23:54.812 --> 00:23:55.914
Yeah, sure, I mean,

535
00:23:55.981 --> 00:23:56.949
she totally loved
her blue nightgown.


536
00:23:57.015 --> 00:23:58.050
Fine. It's fine.

537
00:23:58.118 --> 00:23:59.019
I do think she should not be

538
00:23:59.087 --> 00:24:00.089
bare-shouldered.

539
00:24:00.155 --> 00:24:01.626
I think a wrap or something

540
00:24:01.692 --> 00:24:03.362
over the nightgown
'cause it is cold.


541
00:24:03.428 --> 00:24:05.734
I feel so... I feel so sad

542
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.539
for all the families
that have to go through this.


543
00:24:08.606 --> 00:24:11.378
I don't feel like we should have
a digital funeral.


544
00:24:11.444 --> 00:24:14.049
Honestly, I think it just...
it has to be in person.


545
00:24:14.117 --> 00:24:15.486
H
-How's that gonna happen?

546
00:24:15.553 --> 00:24:18.626
I think we should vote
and see... because I don't feel.


547
00:24:18.693 --> 00:24:20.329
We already decided all this,
Dorsey.


548
00:24:20.396 --> 00:24:22.266
It has to be in real life.

549
00:24:22.333 --> 00:24:23.970
Gigi really wanted all of us
to get together.


550
00:24:24.037 --> 00:24:26.141
Given the circumstances,
I don't wanna be crude,


551
00:24:26.207 --> 00:24:28.245
but of course,
Mama and Bobby are elders.


552
00:24:28.312 --> 00:24:29.547
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


553
00:24:29.615 --> 00:24:31.284
Not that I'm not thinking
about you guys.


554
00:24:31.351 --> 00:24:34.023
Why don't we, like...
we could quarantine for 14 days?


555
00:24:34.089 --> 00:24:36.461
- Dear God.
- We're not gonna do that.


556
00:24:36.528 --> 00:24:37.430
Why not?

557
00:24:37.496 --> 00:24:38.633
How is Robert supposed
to get here?


558
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:39.969
Thank you.

559
00:24:40.035 --> 00:24:41.706
Is that the guy who, like,
sold his soul to the devil


560
00:24:41.772 --> 00:24:43.375
so that he could live in Russia
for the rest of his life?


561
00:24:43.442 --> 00:24:45.512
It's not my fault I had to
expose the government's secrets.


562
00:24:45.579 --> 00:24:46.782
I'm sorry. I had to do that.

563
00:24:46.849 --> 00:24:48.552
- I think you know what?
- I think... thank you.


564
00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.759
I think we should vote,
and I vote for in-person.


565
00:24:51.826 --> 00:24:54.030
I'm in favor
of an in-person funeral.


566
00:24:54.097 --> 00:24:56.401
And at risk of doing something
I'm never gonna do again,


567
00:24:56.468 --> 00:24:57.871
I'm gonna agree with Dorsey.

568
00:24:57.938 --> 00:25:00.542
I think it would be important
for us all to be together.


569
00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.179
I think it would be
really good for Cassidy.


570
00:25:02.246 --> 00:25:03.883
All those people
for not in person?


571
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.321
Everyone for not in person?
There we go.


572
00:25:06.388 --> 00:25:08.392
- Well.
- Look that this.


573
00:25:08.458 --> 00:25:10.529
- Is that your hand up, Alex?
- Alex, are you voting?


574
00:25:10.596 --> 00:25:11.832
- Do I get a vote?
- No.


575
00:25:11.899 --> 00:25:13.068
I don't know,
you started going like this.


576
00:25:13.135 --> 00:25:14.303
Oh, I was just counting
the hands


577
00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:15.974
to see who was up for what.

578
00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:17.009
Did you get a count?

579
00:25:17.076 --> 00:25:18.478
I threw my numbers off
when I...


580
00:25:18.545 --> 00:25:20.617
'cause you guys counted me,
and then I counted myself.


581
00:25:20.684 --> 00:25:23.121
But if I can get another vote.

582
00:25:23.188 --> 00:25:26.461
It looks like we need
a recount in North Carolina.


583
00:25:26.528 --> 00:25:28.633
Y'all, we have to talk
to Grandma's estate attorney,


584
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.302
and you guys have been talking
about nothing,


585
00:25:30.369 --> 00:25:32.206
- and we've gotten nothing done.
- Oh, my God.


586
00:25:32.273 --> 00:25:33.943
Alex, thanks so much
for all your help.


587
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:35.345
- Absolutely.
- Good luck with that meet up.


588
00:25:35.412 --> 00:25:36.615
Everybody just stay on.

589
00:25:36.682 --> 00:25:38.653
The same link for the attorney.
Stay on.


590
00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.122
- Okay, all right.
- I'm staying on.


591
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.591
Bye.

592
00:25:45.432 --> 00:25:47.036
Hello, friends and family,
again.


593
00:25:48.706 --> 00:25:52.379
- I'm confused.
- It's me again, Alex.


594
00:25:52.446 --> 00:25:53.281
And now I know... I know you're
wondering...


595
00:25:53.348 --> 00:25:54.450
you're probably confused.

596
00:25:54.517 --> 00:25:56.521
Like, what is
the funeral director


597
00:25:56.588 --> 00:25:58.358
doing in a meeting with

598
00:25:58.425 --> 00:26:01.665
your grandmother's
estate attorney?


599
00:26:01.732 --> 00:26:05.707
The answer is I'm both.
I'm a... I'm a licensed attorney.


600
00:26:05.774 --> 00:26:08.311
It kinda made sense for me,
business-wise.


601
00:26:08.378 --> 00:26:09.447
You know, I had
the office space,


602
00:26:09.514 --> 00:26:10.917
built-in client base.

603
00:26:10.984 --> 00:26:11.919
Impressive.

604
00:26:11.986 --> 00:26:12.754
Hey, Bret, that sounds

605
00:26:12.821 --> 00:26:14.390
like a new business idea
for you.


606
00:26:14.457 --> 00:26:16.194
- Very funny, Robert.
- Potentially successful.


607
00:26:16.262 --> 00:26:18.198
There's a reason why,
you know,


608
00:26:18.266 --> 00:26:22.339
bail bondsmen set up across
the street from jails, right?


609
00:26:22.406 --> 00:26:24.377
- Oh, my God.
- Who-who found him?


610
00:26:24.443 --> 00:26:25.947
- Katie?
- One price.


611
00:26:26.014 --> 00:26:28.051
- I-I am in the "Pennysaver."
- He is in the "Pennysaver."


612
00:26:28.118 --> 00:26:30.355
Yeah, I mean, if anybody else
in your family passes


613
00:26:30.422 --> 00:26:34.965
or whatever, please use my...
my number, uh, one-stop shop.


614
00:26:35.032 --> 00:26:37.069
Yeah, and let's just get on
with it, please.


615
00:26:37.136 --> 00:26:43.481
Well, Mabel wanted
to address you all directly.


616
00:26:47.156 --> 00:26:50.095
Now?

617
00:26:50.162 --> 00:26:53.201
Hello to my wonderful family.

618
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:57.744
If you're seeing this,
I'm not with you anymore.


619
00:26:57.811 --> 00:27:01.852
First of all, I just wanna say
how great, wonderful, fantastic


620
00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:04.791
it's been to be your mother,
your grandmother,


621
00:27:04.858 --> 00:27:06.594
and your great-grandmother.

622
00:27:06.662 --> 00:27:09.935
To every one of you,
that has been such a joy.


623
00:27:10.002 --> 00:27:13.408
I also wanna say how wonderful
it was


624
00:27:13.475 --> 00:27:15.479
when I fell in love with Judith.

625
00:27:15.545 --> 00:27:18.451
The four years with her
in New York


626
00:27:18.518 --> 00:27:21.725
and the marriage
was absolutely wonderful.


627
00:27:21.792 --> 00:27:24.030
Judith, I am sorry I had
to leave you,


628
00:27:24.096 --> 00:27:26.335
but I felt I had to come home
to die,


629
00:27:26.402 --> 00:27:28.372
and this is home.

630
00:27:28.438 --> 00:27:29.841
I just wanna say

631
00:27:29.908 --> 00:27:32.914
what sort of service
will you have for me?


632
00:27:32.981 --> 00:27:36.087
First of all, I'm not crazy
about the traditional service.


633
00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:37.791
Doesn't have to be that.

634
00:27:37.857 --> 00:27:40.295
I don't know,
maybe I don't believe in God.


635
00:27:40.363 --> 00:27:41.765
I know everybody thinks I want

636
00:27:41.832 --> 00:27:43.803
to be buried
in that blue nightgown.


637
00:27:43.869 --> 00:27:46.408
I don't give a shit
about the nightgown,


638
00:27:46.474 --> 00:27:48.980
so please come together

639
00:27:49.046 --> 00:27:52.387
and figure out where
I want to be buried and how,


640
00:27:52.454 --> 00:27:56.127
or else no one will know
where I'm being laid to rest.


641
00:27:56.194 --> 00:28:02.039
Next, I wanted to say that I am
very disappointed in the family


642
00:28:02.106 --> 00:28:04.845
in terms of what it's been
this last year.


643
00:28:04.911 --> 00:28:07.350
You've all been acting
like jackasses


644
00:28:07.417 --> 00:28:09.053
and keeping so many secrets

645
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.827
from each other, and frankly,
well, I'm sick of it.


646
00:28:12.894 --> 00:28:16.502
Secrets keep people apart,
divided and distant.


647
00:28:16.567 --> 00:28:19.073
So I'm removing that element.

648
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.881
First of all, Diane, I know
you thought that I love Bobby


649
00:28:22.947 --> 00:28:25.486
more than you, and I didn't.

650
00:28:25.552 --> 00:28:27.923
No, I loved you both the same.

651
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:31.296
And Bobby, there is someone
that you must open up to.


652
00:28:31.364 --> 00:28:34.002
You must tell them
what you're feeling.


653
00:28:34.069 --> 00:28:35.439
Do it now.

654
00:28:35.505 --> 00:28:39.814
Bret, I know how hard
it's been since Megan died,


655
00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.519
and you've been raising Cassidy
on your own.


656
00:28:42.585 --> 00:28:44.255
It's very hard.

657
00:28:44.322 --> 00:28:45.459
And I want to say, Bret,

658
00:28:45.525 --> 00:28:49.400
I'm sorry I didn't invest
in your Barcalounger idea.


659
00:28:49.467 --> 00:28:52.806
And also, you never paid back
any of the loans


660
00:28:52.873 --> 00:28:55.545
that so many of us gave you.

661
00:28:55.612 --> 00:28:57.583
And now Katie, you and Kevin

662
00:28:57.649 --> 00:29:00.354
have got to work
your differences out.


663
00:29:00.422 --> 00:29:02.659
And-and most of all, though,
I wanna just thank you


664
00:29:02.726 --> 00:29:08.771
for taking care of me before
I moved here in this joint.


665
00:29:08.838 --> 00:29:11.309
And Dorsey, I wanted to tell you

666
00:29:11.376 --> 00:29:15.418
that I know that the allowance
I sent you helps and mostly


667
00:29:15.485 --> 00:29:19.493
because Max's dad was a poop.

668
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.167
And now I wanted to mention
the arcade business.


669
00:29:23.233 --> 00:29:27.208
Well, it turns out that
there was embezzlement going on,


670
00:29:27.275 --> 00:29:28.811
and it wasn't Diane,

671
00:29:28.878 --> 00:29:31.851
it wasn't Bobby,
and it wasn't me.


672
00:29:31.918 --> 00:29:34.590
Robert, I just wanna say,
I wish you'd ask for money


673
00:29:34.658 --> 00:29:38.666
rather than doing it that way,
but that's what happens.


674
00:29:38.731 --> 00:29:41.771
It's not real. Is that real?

675
00:29:41.837 --> 00:29:43.642
Here's a big one
that I have to tell you.


676
00:29:43.708 --> 00:29:46.648
One of you is not a sibling.

677
00:29:46.714 --> 00:29:48.183
What the fuck?

678
00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:51.658
I think I'll let you all
figure that one out together.


679
00:29:51.724 --> 00:29:54.496
And, you know, I-I think there's
something I should tell you


680
00:29:54.563 --> 00:29:57.001
that I don't... I don't think
any of you ever knew


681
00:29:57.068 --> 00:29:59.138
that I wanted to be a singer.

682
00:29:59.205 --> 00:30:00.475
Duh, duh-duh, duh

683
00:30:02.512 --> 00:30:05.686
That should do it.
I gotta get back to being dead.


684
00:30:05.752 --> 00:30:08.925
So goodbye for now.

685
00:30:14.168 --> 00:30:15.104
Um...

686
00:30:16.373 --> 00:30:17.408
I gotta go.

687
00:30:19.212 --> 00:30:20.214
Whoa.

688
00:30:22.853 --> 00:30:26.393
Wow, Alex, that was not
on our itinerary.


689
00:30:26.459 --> 00:30:29.098
Is that it? Is there more
video? Or is there...


690
00:30:29.165 --> 00:30:31.804
- Mm-hmm.
- Really? How many?


691
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:33.440
There's a few more
I'll send out.


692
00:30:35.077 --> 00:30:36.715
I feel like
we should either start


693
00:30:36.782 --> 00:30:39.085
with Robert embezzling money...

694
00:30:39.152 --> 00:30:40.454
Yeah, let's start there.

695
00:30:40.522 --> 00:30:43.327
Or that one of us is not
related to the other one?


696
00:30:43.393 --> 00:30:44.563
I like that one.

697
00:30:44.631 --> 00:30:46.099
Mama, do you know anything
about this?


698
00:30:46.166 --> 00:30:47.268
What is she talking about?

699
00:30:47.335 --> 00:30:48.538
Do you know anything
about that? Mom?


700
00:30:48.605 --> 00:30:50.374
Are you and uncle Bobby
not brother and sister?


701
00:30:50.441 --> 00:30:51.376
Mama?

702
00:30:51.443 --> 00:30:52.378
Bobby?

703
00:30:52.445 --> 00:30:53.915
Yeah.

704
00:30:53.981 --> 00:30:55.317
Do you have anything to say?

705
00:30:55.384 --> 00:30:57.421
I didn't know
that she could sing.


706
00:30:57.488 --> 00:30:59.627
That's not the important thing
right now.


707
00:30:59.694 --> 00:31:01.698
She was also a stripper
for a short period of time.


708
00:31:01.765 --> 00:31:02.899
- What?
- What?


709
00:31:02.966 --> 00:31:04.001
What the fuck
is going on here?


710
00:31:04.068 --> 00:31:05.572
Alex, do you have
more information?


711
00:31:05.639 --> 00:31:08.276
You can't just play something
like that for us and expect us.


712
00:31:08.343 --> 00:31:09.445
- I gotta say these are...
- these things


713
00:31:09.512 --> 00:31:11.082
are usually, you know,
a little juicy,


714
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:12.451
but this one was a doozy.

715
00:31:12.519 --> 00:31:13.588
Ah, thank you, Alex.

716
00:31:13.655 --> 00:31:15.626
Thank you for your
professional legal advice.


717
00:31:15.693 --> 00:31:18.130
- It's Bret, isn't it?
- Why would it be me?


718
00:31:18.196 --> 00:31:19.232
Because you don't look
like us.


719
00:31:19.298 --> 00:31:21.805
- You don't look like us at all.
- Mom?


720
00:31:21.872 --> 00:31:23.941
- What?
- Is it Bret?


721
00:31:24.008 --> 00:31:25.912
Robert, Dorsey, and I look
like Dad.


722
00:31:25.979 --> 00:31:26.947
Katie looks like mom.

723
00:31:27.014 --> 00:31:28.852
Bret, you look like you walked

724
00:31:28.918 --> 00:31:30.020
out of the woods

725
00:31:30.087 --> 00:31:31.389
with the Wicker Man
or something.


726
00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:33.093
Lots of kids look different
than their parents.


727
00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.997
- Yes, they're called adopted.
- Come on now guys.


728
00:31:35.063 --> 00:31:36.868
This is... this is the opposite

729
00:31:36.934 --> 00:31:38.270
of what...
of what Mabel wants, isn't it?


730
00:31:38.336 --> 00:31:41.577
- Mom, was I adopted?
- Mom, was I adopted?


731
00:31:41.645 --> 00:31:43.046
- This is a shit show...
- Oh, my God.


732
00:31:43.113 --> 00:31:45.083
And no, no one is adopted.

733
00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:46.954
Judith, do you wanna weigh in
on this?


734
00:31:47.021 --> 00:31:49.292
All the pillow talk with our
grandmother for four years?


735
00:31:49.358 --> 00:31:50.394
Don't you have any input?

736
00:31:50.461 --> 00:31:51.564
Yeah, Judith,
what do you know?


737
00:31:51.631 --> 00:31:53.300
It's not for me to say.

738
00:31:53.366 --> 00:31:55.037
Well, somebody's
gotta fucking say it.


739
00:31:55.103 --> 00:31:56.406
Well, I hope I'm not related
to you all.


740
00:31:56.473 --> 00:31:57.610
- I hope I'm not related.
- I understand this is hard


741
00:31:57.677 --> 00:32:00.080
to hear, but if you can
stay calm,


742
00:32:00.147 --> 00:32:02.485
I think it's the
best way forward.


743
00:32:02.551 --> 00:32:03.789
Okay.

744
00:32:03.856 --> 00:32:05.057
Not-not blame each other.

745
00:32:05.123 --> 00:32:06.459
I don't think Mabel wants that.

746
00:32:06.526 --> 00:32:08.163
But I want you all
to know that


747
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:10.803
just because I don't have
any secrets


748
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:13.709
doesn't mean,
I think any less of you, okay?


749
00:32:13.775 --> 00:32:15.344
There's some bombshells here.

750
00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:17.314
There's some digging
that needs to be done.


751
00:32:17.381 --> 00:32:18.685
But if I learned anything

752
00:32:18.752 --> 00:32:21.022
from my time
with the Purakara people,


753
00:32:21.089 --> 00:32:23.293
it's that we're all
in this together.


754
00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.968
And now we've gotta unpack
some stuff, guys.


755
00:32:27.034 --> 00:32:28.537
A-a lot of stuff.

756
00:32:28.605 --> 00:32:31.576
And Bret, you wanna give us
our fucking money?


757
00:32:31.645 --> 00:32:34.717
Yeah, wait, raise your hand
if you've lent money to Bret.


758
00:32:34.784 --> 00:32:37.421
Come...

759
00:32:37.488 --> 00:32:40.460
I just wanna point out that
you guys have all given me shit


760
00:32:40.527 --> 00:32:42.498
for asking for investments

761
00:32:42.565 --> 00:32:44.502
- of money in businesses...
- Loans.


762
00:32:44.569 --> 00:32:45.571
And Dorsey
has been just straight up


763
00:32:45.639 --> 00:32:47.441
getting an allowance
this whole time?


764
00:32:47.508 --> 00:32:49.211
- Did you ask her for money?
- Well, here's what happened.


765
00:32:49.278 --> 00:32:50.447
Did you ask her
for an allowance?


766
00:32:50.514 --> 00:32:51.516
Okay.

767
00:32:51.583 --> 00:32:52.451
Well, Mama, of course
she asked her.


768
00:32:52.518 --> 00:32:54.288
Okay, it was a long time ago.

769
00:32:54.355 --> 00:32:57.494
It was around the time...
and Max, I'm really sorry...


770
00:32:57.561 --> 00:32:58.665
it was around the time
of the divorce,


771
00:32:58.732 --> 00:33:00.400
and I just didn't wanna
have to, like,


772
00:33:00.467 --> 00:33:03.306
owe Max's dad any money.

773
00:33:03.373 --> 00:33:06.312
And so she offered
to give me some money.


774
00:33:06.379 --> 00:33:09.285
I said that would really help.

775
00:33:09.352 --> 00:33:12.291
And then she just kind of
kept sending me


776
00:33:12.358 --> 00:33:13.795
that one amount
that we talked about.


777
00:33:13.862 --> 00:33:16.935
- So you didn't... yeah, you...
- but you didn't ask her to stop.


778
00:33:17.002 --> 00:33:19.438
Do you guys wanna maybe direct
some of your anger toward her?


779
00:33:19.505 --> 00:33:20.574
- Not really...
- If you think about it...


780
00:33:20.642 --> 00:33:21.811
'Cause Dorsey
doesn't owe me money.


781
00:33:21.878 --> 00:33:23.313
You owe me money, Bret.

782
00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.550
Yeah, and by the way,
I gave you money, Bret.


783
00:33:25.618 --> 00:33:28.189
So basically it was just like
Grandma giving you more money.


784
00:33:28.256 --> 00:33:30.327
You made investments,
and I'm sorry


785
00:33:30.394 --> 00:33:32.900
that those investments
didn't pay off.


786
00:33:32.967 --> 00:33:34.568
The ideas were good.

787
00:33:34.636 --> 00:33:36.073
- What's the idea?
- It's a Barcalounger.


788
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:37.274
There's no idea.

789
00:33:37.341 --> 00:33:38.812
If it makes you happy,
I'm bankrupt.


790
00:33:38.879 --> 00:33:40.648
I can't deal
with this right now.


791
00:33:40.716 --> 00:33:41.885
I do wanna address one thing,

792
00:33:41.951 --> 00:33:44.957
and that is Kevin and I,
and we're fine.


793
00:33:45.024 --> 00:33:48.799
And I don't know what
exactly Grandma's talking about.


794
00:33:48.865 --> 00:33:50.500
- What was the thing...
- Where is Kevin?


795
00:33:50.567 --> 00:33:52.072
That she said that you need
to work out your thing?


796
00:33:52.138 --> 00:33:55.343
- Is he living with you?
- He's been... he has the virus.


797
00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:58.150
He has been in the garage
for the whole month.


798
00:33:58.216 --> 00:33:59.485
We have to be cautious.

799
00:33:59.552 --> 00:34:00.587
You don't have to be
that careful.


800
00:34:00.655 --> 00:34:02.058
Hasn't he been tested again?

801
00:34:02.125 --> 00:34:05.330
- He wants to be careful, okay?
- Let's be very clear.


802
00:34:05.397 --> 00:34:07.301
Ah! God damn it! God damn it!

803
00:34:07.367 --> 00:34:09.172
I'm ending this meeting,
I'm sick of this.


804
00:34:09.238 --> 00:34:10.273
Wait, you have to make
a decision.


805
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.442
Katie.

806
00:34:11.509 --> 00:34:12.578
Somebody in the meeting

807
00:34:12.645 --> 00:34:15.118
is not related to the family.

808
00:34:15.184 --> 00:34:16.019
Make it so she can't end
the Zoom.


809
00:34:16.086 --> 00:34:17.021
Stop.

810
00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:18.090
God damn it.

811
00:34:18.157 --> 00:34:19.425
What an absolute shocker.

812
00:34:19.492 --> 00:34:22.098
- She's such a baby.
- You motherfuckers.


813
00:34:30.783 --> 00:34:33.353
All the money in the world...

814
00:34:33.419 --> 00:34:35.290
Thanks, Mom.

815
00:34:35.357 --> 00:34:36.392
She's such a loner,

816
00:34:36.459 --> 00:34:37.863
I can't understand

817
00:34:39.565 --> 00:34:43.274
I go drink with her,
but now I can't control myself


818
00:34:43.339 --> 00:34:47.514
I get excited, and I get upset

819
00:34:47.581 --> 00:34:50.956
And
all the underworld officers...


820
00:34:51.023 --> 00:34:54.764
- Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!
- I'm tired.


821
00:34:54.831 --> 00:34:56.868
Why is your brother
screaming every second?


822
00:34:56.935 --> 00:34:58.772
No one can do one thing
without me.


823
00:34:58.839 --> 00:35:01.076
Stop filming me.

824
00:35:01.143 --> 00:35:02.578
Look how crazy my mom is.

825
00:35:02.645 --> 00:35:03.815
What are you doing?

826
00:35:03.882 --> 00:35:05.618
You're supposed to be doing
Zoom school.


827
00:35:05.685 --> 00:35:09.425
What the hell are you doing?
I said stop filming me!


828
00:35:09.491 --> 00:35:12.599
We all cope or don't cope
in different way.


829
00:35:12.665 --> 00:35:16.740
I swear to God,
if you film me one more time...


830
00:35:16.808 --> 00:35:20.782
And during the lockdown,
it was mostly not coping.


831
00:35:20.849 --> 00:35:22.853
Katie trying to be
the perfect mother


832
00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:27.796
would refer to this as
an amplified reprimand.


833
00:35:27.863 --> 00:35:29.967
Her kids just thought
she had lost it.


834
00:35:34.175 --> 00:35:38.516
- Max, what is that?
- What are you doing?


835
00:35:38.583 --> 00:35:39.719
Nothing.

836
00:35:39.787 --> 00:35:42.424
- I can smell that.
- Give it to me.


837
00:35:42.491 --> 00:35:44.062
It's just a little weed, Mom.

838
00:35:44.129 --> 00:35:45.398
You're smoking weed?

839
00:35:45.463 --> 00:35:47.702
- It helps calm my nerves.
- I don't.


840
00:35:47.769 --> 00:35:49.372
- How do you have nerves?
- You're 17.


841
00:35:49.438 --> 00:35:50.909
And I'm right there.

842
00:35:50.976 --> 00:35:53.113
Are you, like, not scared
of me at all?


843
00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.517
- I'm sorry.
- Where did you get it?


844
00:35:55.583 --> 00:35:56.955
I got it in LA.

845
00:35:57.021 --> 00:35:59.159
You brought it in there
with us?


846
00:35:59.225 --> 00:36:01.697
- Yeah.
- What if I got pulled over?


847
00:36:01.763 --> 00:36:02.866
I would have to lie.

848
00:36:02.933 --> 00:36:05.071
I would have to say
that it is mine


849
00:36:05.137 --> 00:36:07.910
and that I was endangering
the life of my child.


850
00:36:07.977 --> 00:36:11.350
And you would get taken away
from me forever.


851
00:36:11.416 --> 00:36:13.387
Maybe, I mean, that's a little
extreme 'cause you're old,


852
00:36:13.454 --> 00:36:15.859
but, like, how long
have you been smoking weed?


853
00:36:15.926 --> 00:36:19.299
Not too long, just since
the start of the pandemic.


854
00:36:19.366 --> 00:36:20.567
You're endangering us.

855
00:36:20.634 --> 00:36:21.636
I didn't really think of it
like that.


856
00:36:21.703 --> 00:36:24.409
- And your brain cells.
- I'm sorry.


857
00:36:24.476 --> 00:36:26.813
And you're not even sharing.

858
00:36:26.881 --> 00:36:28.250
- I mean.
- Just kidding.


859
00:36:28.317 --> 00:36:30.054
The world's a bunch of shit
right now.


860
00:36:30.121 --> 00:36:31.790
I mean, I... thinking
about my future


861
00:36:31.858 --> 00:36:33.862
and everything going on,

862
00:36:33.928 --> 00:36:36.299
- it's-it's-it's a hell of a lot.
- The world isn't shit.


863
00:36:36.366 --> 00:36:39.472
It's really... maybe, like, right
this exact second,


864
00:36:39.538 --> 00:36:40.909
but everything changes.

865
00:36:40.976 --> 00:36:42.412
Things change so fast,
and, honey,


866
00:36:42.478 --> 00:36:44.749
you don't have to know anything
about your life right now.


867
00:36:44.816 --> 00:36:46.954
And then things are supposed
to suck when you're 17


868
00:36:47.021 --> 00:36:47.990
'cause if they're
really great now,


869
00:36:48.057 --> 00:36:49.793
then where do you go from here?

870
00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.765
Imagine if this is the best year
of your life,


871
00:36:52.832 --> 00:36:54.302
then how much is that
gonna solve?


872
00:36:54.369 --> 00:36:56.506
I mean, my dad is-is a poop.

873
00:36:56.572 --> 00:36:58.510
I mean, and to be... you're
all I got.


874
00:36:58.576 --> 00:37:00.648
And to be fair, you're a poop
too sometimes, but...


875
00:37:00.714 --> 00:37:02.118
No, I get it. I know.

876
00:37:02.185 --> 00:37:04.289
You're less of a shit
than he is.


877
00:37:07.996 --> 00:37:09.732
- I'm gonna go in there.
- Why don't you take a walk?


878
00:37:09.799 --> 00:37:10.835
Actually, why don't we go?

879
00:37:10.902 --> 00:37:12.538
I'm really hungry
all of a sudden.


880
00:37:12.605 --> 00:37:15.744
- Okay.
- Do you wanna just... wait.


881
00:37:15.811 --> 00:37:17.715
It's gonna get better.

882
00:37:17.782 --> 00:37:19.085
I doubt it.

883
00:37:19.152 --> 00:37:21.256
Sammy, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy,
say it with me.


884
00:37:21.323 --> 00:37:22.725
I love paper towels.

885
00:37:22.792 --> 00:37:24.897
Think of everything
you use them for.


886
00:37:24.964 --> 00:37:26.968
Think of everything
that you haven't used them for,


887
00:37:27.034 --> 00:37:30.808
but you will,
and if you can't do that,


888
00:37:30.875 --> 00:37:34.082
I-I-I would move on
right onto paper boxes.


889
00:37:34.149 --> 00:37:37.221
Yeah, yeah.

890
00:37:37.288 --> 00:37:38.390
Hey, listen to me.
You know what?


891
00:37:38.457 --> 00:37:39.759
I'm getting a call.

892
00:37:39.826 --> 00:37:41.096
We will talk soon.

893
00:37:41.163 --> 00:37:45.538
Think about what I said.
Thank you.


894
00:37:45.605 --> 00:37:46.540
Hi.

895
00:37:46.607 --> 00:37:47.643
Hello.

896
00:37:47.708 --> 00:37:49.512
How are you?

897
00:37:49.579 --> 00:37:51.149
I have been better.

898
00:37:54.189 --> 00:37:56.525
You know, you're gonna have
to deal with it.


899
00:37:56.592 --> 00:37:57.929
Excuse me.

900
00:37:57.995 --> 00:38:00.099
I think you're right in there
with me.


901
00:38:00.166 --> 00:38:01.402
I'm aware.

902
00:38:01.468 --> 00:38:05.810
I really just cleaned up
your shit after you abdicated.


903
00:38:05.877 --> 00:38:07.214
Thank you.

904
00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:12.257
I-I just called to see
how you were doing and...


905
00:38:21.008 --> 00:38:22.811
Good talk. Thanks.

906
00:38:27.287 --> 00:38:29.524
They can't keep it
on the shelves.


907
00:38:29.591 --> 00:38:31.963
Thank you, God. Yes.

908
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:36.005
My book is number one
in North Dakota and Nebraska?


909
00:38:37.742 --> 00:38:39.177
Oh, thank you, God.

910
00:38:39.244 --> 00:38:40.913
Thank you, God.
I can't believe this.


911
00:38:40.981 --> 00:38:41.949
- Chad!
- Yes, thank you God.


912
00:38:42.017 --> 00:38:43.819
This is God.

913
00:38:43.886 --> 00:38:46.325
I have no idea
what you're talking about,


914
00:38:46.392 --> 00:38:49.732
but it's not all about you,
is it?


915
00:38:49.798 --> 00:38:51.101
It's about the money
you will give


916
00:38:51.168 --> 00:38:53.306
to your brother, Robert.

917
00:38:58.416 --> 00:38:59.551
Not funny, Robert.

918
00:38:59.619 --> 00:39:00.988
I think it's pretty cute.

919
00:39:01.055 --> 00:39:03.727
How long have you been
inside of my security system?


920
00:39:03.794 --> 00:39:07.233
- I was always here, my son.
- Even with the pornography.


921
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.373
- That is not cool.
- You voyeuristic pervert.


922
00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.911
Do you understand me?
Quit hacking our shit.


923
00:39:12.977 --> 00:39:14.381
Okay, I mean I'm not.

924
00:39:14.448 --> 00:39:16.085
- No one likes it.
- No, but it's a thing.


925
00:39:16.151 --> 00:39:17.954
It's like a... it's like
you don't get it


926
00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:19.659
when normal people get it.

927
00:39:19.726 --> 00:39:20.828
Do you know what I mean by that?

928
00:39:20.893 --> 00:39:23.999
No, but yes, but no.

929
00:39:24.067 --> 00:39:25.604
Anyway, dude, I miss you.

930
00:39:25.671 --> 00:39:27.574
I was calling to say hey to
my big bro.


931
00:39:27.641 --> 00:39:29.945
Yeah, well, it's a weird way
to do it, man.


932
00:39:30.011 --> 00:39:32.083
Hi, how are you?

933
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:37.127
- I'm really lonely.
- Really cold.


934
00:39:37.193 --> 00:39:38.663
Hey, I read your book.

935
00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:40.333
- Really?
- Yeah.


936
00:39:41.502 --> 00:39:43.807
- Well.
- It's really good.


937
00:39:43.874 --> 00:39:47.313
It's very data-driven,
I would say,


938
00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.284
which is not usually my...

939
00:39:49.351 --> 00:39:52.691
It's my personal retelling
of a traumatic event in my life.


940
00:39:52.758 --> 00:39:54.796
It's not data-driven.
I mean, that happened.


941
00:39:54.862 --> 00:39:58.569
A javelin came through and
stabbed me in my torso cavity.


942
00:39:58.637 --> 00:40:00.573
This is really great
and long-winded.


943
00:40:00.641 --> 00:40:02.042
I read it in the book.

944
00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:03.312
Fantastic. I love it.

945
00:40:03.379 --> 00:40:06.418
Millimeters, Robert, okay?

946
00:40:06.485 --> 00:40:10.059
Chad would find out later
that the-the success of his book


947
00:40:10.126 --> 00:40:13.966
was due to a glitch
in an algorithm at Amazon.


948
00:40:14.033 --> 00:40:17.641
And Robert will later take
credit for that said glitch.


949
00:40:17.708 --> 00:40:18.576
Moving in and I knew it.

950
00:40:18.643 --> 00:40:21.181
I have, you know,
and I got myself up.


951
00:40:21.248 --> 00:40:22.685
Not to mention I just felt
an outhouse


952
00:40:22.751 --> 00:40:23.519
for these people, so...

953
00:40:23.586 --> 00:40:25.223
Do you remember
when we watched...


954
00:40:25.289 --> 00:40:27.227
we watched "The Omen,"

955
00:40:27.293 --> 00:40:28.429
and Mom yelled down,

956
00:40:28.496 --> 00:40:29.765
and they're like,
"Is everything okay?"


957
00:40:29.832 --> 00:40:32.270
And Bret was in the corner,
vomiting from it.


958
00:40:32.337 --> 00:40:33.974
I mean, that was "Goonies,"
but yeah.


959
00:40:34.039 --> 00:40:35.309
But any... anyway,
I'm just calling


960
00:40:35.376 --> 00:40:37.313
because Bret and I want
to play "PUBG."


961
00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.253
So if you're
down, meet you in five.


962
00:40:40.319 --> 00:40:41.956
Yeah, right now?

963
00:40:42.022 --> 00:40:45.196
- I said, meet you in five.
- That indicates five minutes.


964
00:40:45.263 --> 00:40:47.333
- Okay.
- Kevin!


965
00:40:49.639 --> 00:40:50.573
I'm exhausted.

966
00:40:50.641 --> 00:40:53.412
I mean, look, we gotta tell
the kids.


967
00:40:53.479 --> 00:40:57.721
How? Like just tear
the Band-Aid off, like, tonight?


968
00:40:57.788 --> 00:40:58.823
Yeah, okay.

969
00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:00.091
All right.

970
00:41:00.159 --> 00:41:03.934
And then you gotta...
you gotta go.


971
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.206
- Leave here?
- No, go.


972
00:41:07.273 --> 00:41:10.146
Oh, nah.

973
00:41:10.212 --> 00:41:11.481
No, go.

974
00:41:11.548 --> 00:41:13.084
Take your fucking stuff
and get it out.


975
00:41:13.152 --> 00:41:15.791
I love it here. Love it.

976
00:41:15.857 --> 00:41:17.560
What are you possibly
talking about?


977
00:41:17.628 --> 00:41:20.066
I'm finally myself, like,
I've found my voice.


978
00:41:20.132 --> 00:41:23.339
- Now you're finding yourself.
- And what is yourself look like?


979
00:41:23.405 --> 00:41:25.409
I've grown more confident.

980
00:41:25.476 --> 00:41:27.815
I think I've found, like,
the truth.


981
00:41:27.881 --> 00:41:29.517
Okay, get-get the fuck out,
Kevin.


982
00:41:29.584 --> 00:41:30.787
I'm gonna go back into my home
when


983
00:41:30.854 --> 00:41:32.323
I feel, like, comfortable
with myself.


984
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:33.960
Okay, my brothers will come
and remove you.


985
00:41:34.027 --> 00:41:35.096
- Okay.
- Bye.


986
00:41:35.196 --> 00:41:36.298
- That's doubtful, but...
- Start packing.


987
00:41:36.365 --> 00:41:37.935
Let 'em try.

988
00:41:38.002 --> 00:41:39.037
- Ugh.
- What?


989
00:41:39.104 --> 00:41:40.841
I said, ugh!

990
00:42:01.581 --> 00:42:06.358
Boo. I'm a ghost. Hi, family.

991
00:42:06.425 --> 00:42:08.228
Something tells me that
you still


992
00:42:08.295 --> 00:42:10.967
haven't figured out
where to bury me.


993
00:42:11.034 --> 00:42:12.738
I'm tired, kids.

994
00:42:12.805 --> 00:42:16.111
Can you hurry it up?
Now, how could I forget?


995
00:42:16.178 --> 00:42:20.252
I-I have not mentioned yet
my great-grandchildren,


996
00:42:20.319 --> 00:42:23.727
but Max and Cassidy,
it's now your turn.


997
00:42:23.793 --> 00:42:27.201
Maxwell,
stop downloading so much porn.


998
00:42:27.266 --> 00:42:28.803
I mean, you can stream it,

999
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:31.007
but downloading,
that means your mom


1000
00:42:31.074 --> 00:42:34.615
has to buy you a new computer
about every 18 months,


1001
00:42:34.682 --> 00:42:37.654
and her allowance
isn't that much.


1002
00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:39.959
And Bret, you really should
pay attention


1003
00:42:40.025 --> 00:42:42.396
to your credit card bills.

1004
00:42:42.463 --> 00:42:46.171
Right, Cassidy? 
My sugar plum.

1005
00:42:46.239 --> 00:42:49.477
And Bobby, hey, how's it going?

1006
00:42:49.544 --> 00:42:51.515
Got anything
you wanna talk about?


1007
00:42:51.581 --> 00:42:54.053
Your own little secret?

1008
00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.893
Also, we are rich.

1009
00:42:56.959 --> 00:43:02.069
I mean really filthy stinking,
fucking rich.


1010
00:43:02.136 --> 00:43:03.807
Goodbye.

1011
00:43:05.442 --> 00:43:07.346
- Okay.
- Max.


1012
00:43:07.413 --> 00:43:10.352
Cassidy? Cassidy?

1013
00:43:10.419 --> 00:43:11.555
Cassidy, open up.

1014
00:43:11.622 --> 00:43:13.693
Have you been using
my credit cards?


1015
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.362
Mom, what does she mean
by rich?


1016
00:43:15.429 --> 00:43:17.066
- It's-it's news.
- It's news to me.


1017
00:43:17.133 --> 00:43:18.603
- Like, how rich?
- And, Bobby, is it news to you?


1018
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:20.406
- What does that mean?
- I have no idea.


1019
00:43:20.472 --> 00:43:22.343
Is it enough money
if someone wanted


1020
00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:24.281
to start a life on their own?

1021
00:43:24.347 --> 00:43:25.617
Just let's say someone,

1022
00:43:25.684 --> 00:43:27.287
maybe didn't
wanna be married to the person


1023
00:43:27.353 --> 00:43:29.123
that they're married to anymore
and they had three kids.


1024
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:31.027
Like, would it be enough money
for that person?


1025
00:43:31.094 --> 00:43:34.000
Or maybe enough money to stop
taking money from your grandma?


1026
00:43:34.067 --> 00:43:36.939
Are we talking about, like,
if somebody on this list


1027
00:43:37.006 --> 00:43:39.745
wanted to do a little nip
and tuck and a little pull up


1028
00:43:39.812 --> 00:43:41.381
and a ring light
that just, like,


1029
00:43:41.448 --> 00:43:42.317
hovers around them
all the time...


1030
00:43:42.383 --> 00:43:43.720
Not cool. Not cool.

1031
00:43:43.786 --> 00:43:47.728
- Is it that kind of rich?
- Uh, not that rich.


1032
00:43:47.794 --> 00:43:49.732
If anyone's gonna get a lot
of money, it's me.


1033
00:43:49.798 --> 00:43:51.101
I'd be worried
if I were some of y'all.


1034
00:43:51.167 --> 00:43:53.740
Judith, yeah, what does
she mean by rich, rich?


1035
00:43:53.806 --> 00:43:55.142
- That's not for me to say.
- I'm-I'm afraid.


1036
00:43:55.209 --> 00:43:58.048
- It's not for you to say?
- Not for you to say?


1037
00:43:58.115 --> 00:44:00.419
Say something. Come on.

1038
00:44:00.486 --> 00:44:01.923
- Oh, my God.
- Judith?


1039
00:44:01.989 --> 00:44:04.060
- Guys, get your shit together.
- Judith? Judith?


1040
00:44:04.127 --> 00:44:06.064
Like, what are we doing
wasting time like this?


1041
00:44:06.131 --> 00:44:07.701
Wait, wait.

1042
00:44:07.768 --> 00:44:11.074
Way to go, Chad. 
Now she's gone.

1043
00:44:11.141 --> 00:44:15.149
Nothing like an inheritance
to get the family greed boiling.


1044
00:44:15.215 --> 00:44:16.886
But I think Mabel's lying.

1045
00:44:16.953 --> 00:44:20.694
There are many definitions
of rich.


1046
00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:22.063
That's her body.

1047
00:44:22.129 --> 00:44:25.337
Task Rabbit, whoo!
Up you go. Let's go.


1048
00:44:25.403 --> 00:44:28.008
Follow that hearse, honey.
Let's go. Come on, now.


1049
00:44:28.075 --> 00:44:29.878
- Up you go. Follow that hearse.
- All right.


1050
00:44:29.945 --> 00:44:32.183
- Go, go, go, go.
- All right.


1051
00:44:32.249 --> 00:44:34.187
Follow the hearse.

1052
00:44:34.253 --> 00:44:35.623
Oh, Jesus.

1053
00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:38.061
It's harder than it looks,
Judith.


1054
00:44:38.128 --> 00:44:39.331
This hearse is a lot faster

1055
00:44:39.398 --> 00:44:41.534
than I am.

1056
00:44:41.602 --> 00:44:43.840
- Hi, Bobby.
- Hi, listen, Judith.


1057
00:44:43.906 --> 00:44:46.879
I am so sorry that it's under
these circumstances,


1058
00:44:46.946 --> 00:44:49.250
but I'm very happy
to be able to talk to you.


1059
00:44:49.317 --> 00:44:51.455
I'm a little busy
at the moment, Bobby.


1060
00:44:51.521 --> 00:44:52.724
So what's-what's up?

1061
00:44:52.791 --> 00:44:54.395
I just wanted to know

1062
00:44:54.461 --> 00:44:59.070
how Mom felt about me,
actually, is the question.


1063
00:44:59.137 --> 00:45:01.509
I think she wanted you
to come home,


1064
00:45:01.574 --> 00:45:03.813
and you never did that.

1065
00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.683
So I think she was hurt.

1066
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:08.021
The last thing I wanted to do
was to hurt her.


1067
00:45:08.088 --> 00:45:11.161
I couldn't come home.
If-if I could, I would've.


1068
00:45:11.227 --> 00:45:13.399
You know what, hey,
it's-it's not about me.


1069
00:45:13.466 --> 00:45:15.069
How are you?

1070
00:45:15.135 --> 00:45:17.741
Well, I'm heartbroken,
actually.


1071
00:45:19.143 --> 00:45:22.651
I loved your mother very much,
and I don't know


1072
00:45:22.717 --> 00:45:26.759
that I will ever get over not
being with her when she died.


1073
00:45:26.826 --> 00:45:28.863
Well, I mean, you were there
with us on the Zoom.


1074
00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:31.134
- No, no, no, no.
- She didn't want me there.


1075
00:45:31.201 --> 00:45:35.777
That act of pushing you away
was a demonstration of love.


1076
00:45:35.844 --> 00:45:38.348
She-she knew
she was going to die.


1077
00:45:38.416 --> 00:45:41.822
She knew that was going
to just break your heart in two.


1078
00:45:41.889 --> 00:45:43.125
I see what you're saying,

1079
00:45:43.191 --> 00:45:45.062
but I have to say
it still hurts.


1080
00:45:45.129 --> 00:45:46.932
- It sounds painful.
- Oh, God.


1081
00:45:46.999 --> 00:45:48.936
- Who is that?
- Never mind. Never mind.


1082
00:45:49.003 --> 00:45:50.608
- Never mind?
- Is somebody else on the line?


1083
00:45:50.673 --> 00:45:52.677
Oh, shit. Oh, wait.

1084
00:45:52.744 --> 00:45:54.347
Then I gotta make... I gotta make
a U-turn.


1085
00:45:54.414 --> 00:45:56.351
- She's doing a task for me.
- An errand.


1086
00:45:56.418 --> 00:45:57.921
God please let me make
the roller derby team.


1087
00:45:57.988 --> 00:45:59.658
Just don't-don't-don't worry
about it.


1088
00:45:59.725 --> 00:46:04.636
Listen, I think that if she knew
what you were contemplating,


1089
00:46:04.701 --> 00:46:07.406
I think she would tell you
to do it


1090
00:46:07.474 --> 00:46:09.511
and that she's proud of you.

1091
00:46:09.578 --> 00:46:10.747
Thank you, thank you.

1092
00:46:10.813 --> 00:46:13.486
She sounds like
a really amazing woman.


1093
00:46:13.553 --> 00:46:15.423
Oh, my... okay.

1094
00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:16.892
My mother was
the complete opposite.


1095
00:46:16.959 --> 00:46:18.796
- You're welcome, Bobby.
- You're welcome.


1096
00:46:18.863 --> 00:46:20.199
She didn't like anything
I did.


1097
00:46:20.265 --> 00:46:21.835
Oh, Task... whoo!

1098
00:46:21.902 --> 00:46:23.674
Task Rabbit, snap out of it now.

1099
00:46:23.739 --> 00:46:24.875
Come on now.

1100
00:46:24.942 --> 00:46:27.279
I think you have to track
that body.


1101
00:46:27.346 --> 00:46:28.684
Okay, I'm sorry.

1102
00:46:28.749 --> 00:46:30.152
Look ahead.

1103
00:46:30.219 --> 00:46:33.726
Look where you're going.
Yes, is that the funeral home?


1104
00:46:33.793 --> 00:46:35.863
Wait, I think I see
the funeral home.


1105
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:39.136
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my God. I did it.


1106
00:46:39.203 --> 00:46:41.174
I did... I may have
to charge extra, Judith.


1107
00:46:41.241 --> 00:46:42.309
I'm exhausted.

1108
00:46:42.376 --> 00:46:43.479
- Judith?
- Yes.


1109
00:46:43.546 --> 00:46:46.150
Are you following the body?

1110
00:46:46.217 --> 00:46:47.887
That's exactly
what she's doing, yes.


1111
00:46:47.954 --> 00:46:49.992
Look, I miss her,
and I wanna...


1112
00:46:50.058 --> 00:46:52.764
I wanna know where her body is

1113
00:46:52.831 --> 00:46:54.868
until we bury her properly.

1114
00:46:54.935 --> 00:46:56.237
That's sweet.

1115
00:46:56.304 --> 00:46:58.876
I'm sorry to say this
to you, Bobby.


1116
00:46:58.943 --> 00:47:00.480
I think your mother believed

1117
00:47:00.546 --> 00:47:03.552
that the family
that she knew and loved was dead


1118
00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:09.230
and that what you need to do
is to begin again as a family


1119
00:47:09.297 --> 00:47:14.440
and to do that with the truth,
is that making sense?


1120
00:47:14.508 --> 00:47:15.475
Yeah, yeah, it does.

1121
00:47:15.543 --> 00:47:16.912
I think maybe this is
a good time


1122
00:47:16.979 --> 00:47:19.083
for me to... for me to go.

1123
00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:21.588
- Whoo-hoo.
- This task is not complete.


1124
00:47:21.656 --> 00:47:22.692
- Geez, fine.
- Okay?


1125
00:47:22.758 --> 00:47:24.259
So I'll just let you know.

1126
00:47:24.326 --> 00:47:26.296
I need you to keep streaming.
Bobby.


1127
00:47:26.363 --> 00:47:29.469
- Yes, yes.
- I have to go. Bye, now.


1128
00:47:41.795 --> 00:47:45.636
Eww. Max, stop it.

1129
00:47:47.338 --> 00:47:49.409
You can't just fart in here.

1130
00:47:52.415 --> 00:47:53.585
Hey, Mama.

1131
00:47:53.652 --> 00:47:55.555
Still the only one
who calls me on that thing.


1132
00:47:55.623 --> 00:47:59.062
- I'm on your fridge again?
- I called your regular email.


1133
00:47:59.129 --> 00:48:01.199
Yeah, yeah, well,
you can't call an email,


1134
00:48:01.266 --> 00:48:03.571
and you email
my college email still,


1135
00:48:03.639 --> 00:48:06.510
which is just like
a burner sign up email.


1136
00:48:06.577 --> 00:48:09.885
Forget it. What's up?

1137
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:11.822
How are the kids?

1138
00:48:11.889 --> 00:48:13.759
They're good.

1139
00:48:13.826 --> 00:48:18.033
Just hoping...
it's just Zoom school is so...


1140
00:48:19.905 --> 00:48:21.139
What?

1141
00:48:22.877 --> 00:48:24.145
I may have made a mistake,

1142
00:48:24.212 --> 00:48:26.016
and I wanted
to talk to you about it.


1143
00:48:26.082 --> 00:48:28.053
Okay.

1144
00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:29.791
I know this pandemic's
got me...


1145
00:48:29.858 --> 00:48:31.426
it's smooshing me.

1146
00:48:31.493 --> 00:48:34.232
It's-it's... I mean,
it's, like, some...


1147
00:48:34.299 --> 00:48:38.440
some kind of inner jelly
is spilling through.


1148
00:48:38.507 --> 00:48:41.112
Wait, what
are you talking about?


1149
00:48:41.179 --> 00:48:44.385
Small mistakes can be fixed.

1150
00:48:44.452 --> 00:48:46.792
Big mistakes, some are so big
that they...


1151
00:48:46.859 --> 00:48:49.195
you can't even see them.

1152
00:48:49.262 --> 00:48:51.566
They're so big
they change everything.


1153
00:48:51.635 --> 00:48:54.339
They change you.

1154
00:48:54.405 --> 00:48:59.182
- Mama, okay, what happened?
- What?


1155
00:48:59.249 --> 00:49:02.255
Do you have, like,
an entire second family


1156
00:49:02.321 --> 00:49:03.926
or something
that we don't even know about?


1157
00:49:03.993 --> 00:49:05.361
No.

1158
00:49:05.427 --> 00:49:10.538
- Okay, then what is it?
- Katie, I...


1159
00:49:13.043 --> 00:49:17.151
I wanted to tell you that I...

1160
00:49:21.192 --> 00:49:23.297
Mama, I gotta call you back.

1161
00:49:26.403 --> 00:49:27.974
Stay away from that rooster!

1162
00:49:28.041 --> 00:49:29.242
To the west,
to the west toilet.


1163
00:49:29.309 --> 00:49:30.746
Three guys.

1164
00:49:30.813 --> 00:49:32.850
Hey, can you guys drop ammo
for me?


1165
00:49:32.917 --> 00:49:34.955
Ammo, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha,
gotcha. Top tower.


1166
00:49:35.021 --> 00:49:38.427
No, not yet. Not yet.

1167
00:49:38.493 --> 00:49:39.764
- Got 'em.
- All right.


1168
00:49:39.831 --> 00:49:41.067
On the count of three.

1169
00:49:41.132 --> 00:49:44.439
- Boom, baby.
- You got...


1170
00:49:44.505 --> 00:49:45.541
Do you think
we should have tried


1171
00:49:45.609 --> 00:49:46.812
to play video games
with Mabel?


1172
00:49:46.878 --> 00:49:49.951
Every shot is a headshot.

1173
00:49:50.018 --> 00:49:51.486
I miss her.

1174
00:49:51.553 --> 00:49:52.588
What if we brought her on
and she just fucking owned?


1175
00:49:52.657 --> 00:49:55.127
- She really was.
- She's kooky as shit.


1176
00:49:55.194 --> 00:49:56.529
She was fun, though.

1177
00:49:56.597 --> 00:49:58.300
Remember that time
that she gave you whiskey


1178
00:49:58.367 --> 00:49:59.535
for your 16th birthday

1179
00:49:59.603 --> 00:50:02.174
and Dad got so mad at her?

1180
00:50:02.241 --> 00:50:04.178
- Yeah.
- Hey, Bret, I gotta ask you,


1181
00:50:04.245 --> 00:50:06.349
what is going on
with Cassidy's make up?


1182
00:50:06.416 --> 00:50:08.253
Oh, my gosh. Yes.

1183
00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.489
- I mean.
- Details.


1184
00:50:09.555 --> 00:50:10.591
Being a teenager is hard

1185
00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:12.129
these days, you know
what I mean?


1186
00:50:12.194 --> 00:50:13.263
Especially right now.

1187
00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:14.565
Can't see your friends,
you know,


1188
00:50:14.633 --> 00:50:16.469
she's worried about the
funeral.


1189
00:50:16.536 --> 00:50:18.407
One thing I remember
when I was growing up,


1190
00:50:18.473 --> 00:50:20.011
Mom used to tell me

1191
00:50:20.078 --> 00:50:24.452
that the kind of guys she liked,
were, like, the gentlemen


1192
00:50:24.519 --> 00:50:25.587
who treated her nice

1193
00:50:25.655 --> 00:50:26.892
and pulled out her chair
and stuff.


1194
00:50:26.958 --> 00:50:28.460
But really what I realized now
in hindsight is


1195
00:50:28.527 --> 00:50:29.630
what she was doing is,

1196
00:50:29.698 --> 00:50:32.334
she was basically telling
me how to be.


1197
00:50:32.401 --> 00:50:34.106
So maybe you could use some

1198
00:50:34.173 --> 00:50:36.878
subversive kind of stuff
on Cassidy


1199
00:50:36.945 --> 00:50:39.616
and say, like, how much
you enjoyed it


1200
00:50:39.683 --> 00:50:42.122
when women don't wear makeup.

1201
00:50:42.189 --> 00:50:44.694
- She's a pretty smart kid.
- I feel like she's gonna see


1202
00:50:44.761 --> 00:50:47.132
right through that
and, like, use some sort of,


1203
00:50:47.199 --> 00:50:49.302
like, judo, reverse psychology

1204
00:50:49.368 --> 00:50:51.073
and turn my own energy
back on me


1205
00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:53.077
and all of a sudden,
I'll be wearing makeup.


1206
00:50:53.144 --> 00:50:56.416
Okay, let's move
to the southwest quadrant.


1207
00:50:56.483 --> 00:50:57.652
There's no one here.

1208
00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:00.058
Robert, are you feeling
safe out there


1209
00:51:00.125 --> 00:51:03.563
or do you feel like the pipe
fitter's union is after you?


1210
00:51:03.631 --> 00:51:05.001
The pipe fitter's union
is after all of us.


1211
00:51:05.068 --> 00:51:08.406
It's the only thing other than...
seriously plumbing?


1212
00:51:08.473 --> 00:51:09.676
Are you kidding me?

1213
00:51:09.744 --> 00:51:10.746
That's the only thing
that connects all of us.


1214
00:51:10.813 --> 00:51:12.682
What other thing connects all?

1215
00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:14.285
- The internet.
- God.


1216
00:51:14.352 --> 00:51:15.956
God and electricity.

1217
00:51:16.023 --> 00:51:17.291
Dude, it pairs.

1218
00:51:17.358 --> 00:51:18.862
It's-it's one
and the same thing.


1219
00:51:18.929 --> 00:51:20.933
I'm completely ignoring
what you're saying, Robert,


1220
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.472
just like the entire world
completely ignored your leak.


1221
00:51:24.539 --> 00:51:26.110
You could go fuck yourself.

1222
00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:30.051
Robert, how often do you go
outside in Moscow?


1223
00:51:30.118 --> 00:51:31.654
Every morning and stuff.

1224
00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:32.990
I do have to say, like,

1225
00:51:33.057 --> 00:51:34.525
the best part of my day
is waking up


1226
00:51:34.592 --> 00:51:37.531
and just, like, smelling
the honeysuckles out there.


1227
00:51:37.599 --> 00:51:39.069
They have honeysuckle
in Russia?


1228
00:51:39.136 --> 00:51:41.073
Yeah, every place
has the honeysuckles, I mean...


1229
00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:42.374
You're talking about the farm
or Moscow?


1230
00:51:42.441 --> 00:51:43.912
Moscow.

1231
00:51:43.979 --> 00:51:46.016
It just reminds me of the farm
back at home,


1232
00:51:46.083 --> 00:51:49.022
and it-it was
just... it brings me, you know,


1233
00:51:49.089 --> 00:51:53.430
great memories of, you know,
visiting it when we were young.


1234
00:51:55.034 --> 00:51:56.905
You guys, I'm gonna
hit the bathroom real quick.


1235
00:51:56.972 --> 00:51:58.909
- What?
- Drop-drop your guns real fast.


1236
00:51:58.976 --> 00:52:01.714
- Oh. There you go.
- So I'll take 'em.


1237
00:52:01.781 --> 00:52:04.086
Okay, Chaddy, it's me and you.

1238
00:52:04.152 --> 00:52:07.960
I actually am going
to the bathroom as well.


1239
00:52:08.027 --> 00:52:09.663
Guys, come on.

1240
00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:11.300
The round's only

1241
00:52:11.367 --> 00:52:12.602
Dookie break.

1242
00:52:12.669 --> 00:52:15.241
My brothers abandon me
in a graveyard


1243
00:52:15.308 --> 00:52:18.648
where I am alone to die,

1244
00:52:18.714 --> 00:52:22.421
and now I'm... I am completely
talking to myself.


1245
00:52:22.488 --> 00:52:23.792
You're not taking a poop?

1246
00:52:23.859 --> 00:52:25.762
I don't think Robert's
in Russia.


1247
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:27.900
- What are you talking about?
- I think he's at the farm.


1248
00:52:27.967 --> 00:52:29.703
You think Robert
is at the farm?


1249
00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:31.140
The other day, he had a mug

1250
00:52:31.206 --> 00:52:32.776
that looked
exactly like Grandpa's,


1251
00:52:32.843 --> 00:52:34.212
and when we asked him
to hold it up,


1252
00:52:34.279 --> 00:52:36.582
he, like, covered it with
his hand, which was super weird.


1253
00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:37.987
Like, why wouldn't he
just show it to us?


1254
00:52:38.054 --> 00:52:41.492
So unless he went to the farm,
got Grandpa's mug


1255
00:52:41.559 --> 00:52:44.498
before going... before fleeing
to Russia.


1256
00:52:44.565 --> 00:52:45.903
That's entirely possible.

1257
00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:48.274
Fleeing to Russia
for a leak about plumbing?


1258
00:52:48.341 --> 00:52:49.475
Like, nobody has to do that.

1259
00:52:49.542 --> 00:52:50.946
Like, Snowden
had to go to Russia.


1260
00:52:51.013 --> 00:52:52.984
Like, he, like, he leaked
some bad shit.


1261
00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:55.188
Nobody cares
about Robert's thing.


1262
00:52:55.254 --> 00:52:57.625
Also, he just said something
about a honeysuckle like,


1263
00:52:57.692 --> 00:52:59.363
do they have honeysuckle
in Russia?


1264
00:52:59.429 --> 00:53:00.631
Okay, I don't know, dude.

1265
00:53:00.698 --> 00:53:02.870
He's a pretty big deal
in this hacking world.


1266
00:53:02.937 --> 00:53:05.008
Like, these guys, these nerds,
they-they really get


1267
00:53:05.074 --> 00:53:08.381
on each other's backs,
and I'm-I'm not sure.


1268
00:53:08.447 --> 00:53:10.785
Could you just drive out there
and see if he's there?


1269
00:53:10.853 --> 00:53:13.124
No, dude, we're in the middle
of a pandemic, dude.


1270
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:14.426
Just get out there,
put a mask on.


1271
00:53:14.493 --> 00:53:15.828
See if he's there. I can't go.

1272
00:53:15.896 --> 00:53:17.564
I have Cassidy.
I gotta look after her.


1273
00:53:17.632 --> 00:53:18.935
Well, I have obligations too.

1274
00:53:19.002 --> 00:53:20.238
Come on,
you gotta do... just do it.


1275
00:53:20.304 --> 00:53:21.106
What does it look like...

1276
00:53:21.173 --> 00:53:22.509
Dudes, dudes,
what's happening?


1277
00:53:22.574 --> 00:53:24.346
Come on. Are we not playing?

1278
00:53:24.413 --> 00:53:25.515
I finished up in the bathroom.

1279
00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:26.850
I just had a quick question
for Chad.


1280
00:53:26.918 --> 00:53:28.654
But why are you FaceTiming
each other


1281
00:53:28.721 --> 00:53:30.224
while going to the bathroom?

1282
00:53:30.291 --> 00:53:33.097
Kinda got sidetracked
in the restroom.


1283
00:53:33.164 --> 00:53:36.103
It doesn't look like you're
pooping, though, Bret.


1284
00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:39.209
I just had a quick question
for Chad about the-the funeral.


1285
00:53:39.276 --> 00:53:42.581
I just wanted to run it by him
before we got back in there.


1286
00:53:42.649 --> 00:53:46.090
- Yeah.
- That makes no sense, Bret.


1287
00:53:46.156 --> 00:53:48.327
Well, what makes sense
these days?


1288
00:53:48.394 --> 00:53:51.133
Everybody's inside
for six months, so.


1289
00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.268
Okay, you guys
are being weird.


1290
00:53:52.335 --> 00:53:53.537
Come on, let's go back
to the game.


1291
00:53:53.604 --> 00:53:54.907
This is stupid.

1292
00:53:54.974 --> 00:53:56.777
- Robert.
- What?


1293
00:53:56.844 --> 00:53:58.314
Real quick, what's
the temperature


1294
00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:00.218
right now in Moscow?

1295
00:54:00.284 --> 00:54:03.424
22 degrees centigrade.

1296
00:54:03.491 --> 00:54:05.862
- Cool.
- Yeah?


1297
00:54:05.929 --> 00:54:07.532
- Yeah.
- Let's play this game.


1298
00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.471
All right, I will see you
on the battlefield.


1299
00:54:10.538 --> 00:54:11.773
You guys are weird.

1300
00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:12.943
I have the weirdest brothers
in the world.


1301
00:54:22.095 --> 00:54:23.464
Hey.

1302
00:54:23.531 --> 00:54:24.900
- Hey.
- Nice night.


1303
00:54:24.967 --> 00:54:26.503
I'm out here just getting
some fresh air,


1304
00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:28.407
having some free time.

1305
00:54:28.474 --> 00:54:29.476
Eat my gummy worms, you know.

1306
00:54:29.543 --> 00:54:31.146
My dad's currently
freaking out right now


1307
00:54:31.213 --> 00:54:33.684
because of Grandma's secret
sharing sessions.


1308
00:54:33.751 --> 00:54:34.954
- How do you know?
- I never really knew her.


1309
00:54:35.021 --> 00:54:36.356
Of course, I did.
Of course, I knew grandma.


1310
00:54:36.423 --> 00:54:37.292
I spent more time with her.

1311
00:54:37.358 --> 00:54:40.431
She's so much fun
and smart too.


1312
00:54:40.498 --> 00:54:44.806
My mom did tell me, though,
that her favorite sandwich


1313
00:54:44.873 --> 00:54:47.111
was banana and mayonnaise.

1314
00:54:47.178 --> 00:54:50.551
- And I've seen her eat them.
- It's disgusting.


1315
00:54:50.619 --> 00:54:52.822
What-what are you doing?

1316
00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:54.759
- Chilling.
- That's cool.


1317
00:54:54.826 --> 00:54:56.664
Statistically speaking,
over the years,


1318
00:54:56.730 --> 00:55:01.073
it's-it's been harder to get
young adults to leave the nest,


1319
00:55:01.139 --> 00:55:05.781
but after months of being safer
at home with their parents,


1320
00:55:05.848 --> 00:55:08.420
those statistics
would probably change.


1321
00:55:10.224 --> 00:55:12.730
Hello, I'm calling
about Mabel Worth?


1322
00:55:12.795 --> 00:55:14.967
Alex, hi, hi.

1323
00:55:15.034 --> 00:55:18.340
- How are we burying her?
- What's-what's the plan?


1324
00:55:18.407 --> 00:55:21.179
- You know what?
- We're still working on it.


1325
00:55:21.246 --> 00:55:22.582
All right, well,
you're outta time.


1326
00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:24.486
All right, look, I'm only
contracted for a few more days,


1327
00:55:24.552 --> 00:55:26.056
and then we're handing her back
to you in a...


1328
00:55:26.123 --> 00:55:27.859
in a brown box, okay?

1329
00:55:27.925 --> 00:55:30.364
That's nice. We... yes.

1330
00:55:30.431 --> 00:55:32.969
I'm gonna call you soon.
Very soon.


1331
00:55:34.973 --> 00:55:36.109
That was too rude.

1332
00:55:36.176 --> 00:55:37.845
I'm so sorry.
I should call her back.


1333
00:55:37.912 --> 00:55:41.086
Mommy! Mommy!

1334
00:55:41.153 --> 00:55:44.492
Alex.

1335
00:55:44.559 --> 00:55:47.298
- Yeah, sorry-sorry.
- That-that was so rude.


1336
00:55:47.365 --> 00:55:49.969
Uh, I just need the family
to decide.


1337
00:55:54.879 --> 00:55:56.850
Come on, everybody

1338
00:55:56.917 --> 00:55:59.322
Ooh, let's have a good time

1339
00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:04.165
Separate the clouds
and celebrate the sunshine


1340
00:56:04.232 --> 00:56:09.242
Livin' day-to-day,
I said I have a good time


1341
00:56:09.309 --> 00:56:14.319
Left, right, left, another step
'cause life's a straight line


1342
00:56:14.386 --> 00:56:20.131
Won't somebody new take me
far away?


1343
00:56:26.677 --> 00:56:29.048
I want to start this off
by saying I know exactly


1344
00:56:29.115 --> 00:56:31.854
where Mother wants to be buried.

1345
00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:33.557
She wants to be buried
at the farm.


1346
00:56:33.625 --> 00:56:36.997
- No.
- Yes, agreed. Yes, she did.


1347
00:56:37.064 --> 00:56:40.404
I think we should bury Mom
at sea


1348
00:56:40.471 --> 00:56:42.542
because the Buddhist point
of view


1349
00:56:42.609 --> 00:56:45.816
is that water is cleansing,
and it is also the element...


1350
00:56:45.882 --> 00:56:47.151
She's not Buddhist.

1351
00:56:47.218 --> 00:56:48.987
Bobby, maybe you can
bury yourself at sea.


1352
00:56:49.055 --> 00:56:50.357
Stop, come on.

1353
00:56:50.424 --> 00:56:51.860
I would like to just say

1354
00:56:51.927 --> 00:56:54.398
that I would like to keep this
to serious suggestions.


1355
00:56:54.465 --> 00:56:56.803
I'm serious about
the grandfather mountain.


1356
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:58.105
She loved it, and it was a place

1357
00:56:58.172 --> 00:57:00.310
that she talked
about constantly.


1358
00:57:00.376 --> 00:57:01.646
The place she loved
more than anything


1359
00:57:01.713 --> 00:57:02.648
was the beautiful farm.

1360
00:57:02.715 --> 00:57:03.983
I mean, there's no question
about it.


1361
00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:05.018
There's no question.

1362
00:57:05.086 --> 00:57:06.555
I just wanna throw this out.

1363
00:57:06.623 --> 00:57:07.892
What if we buried her
at Parker's?


1364
00:57:07.959 --> 00:57:09.896
- The barbecue place?
- Yeah.


1365
00:57:09.963 --> 00:57:11.365
Oh, my goodness.

1366
00:57:11.432 --> 00:57:13.135
I do hate you,
but that's a really good idea.


1367
00:57:13.202 --> 00:57:15.406
- I love that.
- Thank you.


1368
00:57:15.473 --> 00:57:18.246
She did love their coleslaw.

1369
00:57:18.312 --> 00:57:19.616
- Oh, my God!
- Love it.


1370
00:57:19.682 --> 00:57:22.153
Every time we went
to go visit her grave,


1371
00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:23.589
we could go get Parker's.

1372
00:57:23.657 --> 00:57:25.761
We could go get barbecue
every single time.


1373
00:57:25.828 --> 00:57:27.297
Wait, when was the last time...

1374
00:57:27.364 --> 00:57:29.033
I'm trying to remember,
when were we there?


1375
00:57:29.101 --> 00:57:30.604
- I know. It's when...
- When?


1376
00:57:30.671 --> 00:57:33.175
We were all sitting... we were
all sitting around the booth,


1377
00:57:33.242 --> 00:57:35.346
and that little baby
was crying in the corner,


1378
00:57:35.413 --> 00:57:37.117
and she just turned around
and said,


1379
00:57:37.183 --> 00:57:41.358
"Excuse me, could you please put
your tit in that baby's mouth?"


1380
00:57:41.425 --> 00:57:44.131
- That's right.
- Remember that?


1381
00:57:44.197 --> 00:57:46.435
Yeah, it was my baby.

1382
00:57:48.807 --> 00:57:51.613
Remember Grandma always said,
"You've gotta order extra."


1383
00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:54.953
She would say that even though
you had extra at home already.


1384
00:57:55.019 --> 00:57:57.157
You had extra in the freezer
at home,


1385
00:57:57.223 --> 00:57:58.459
and she'd be like,
"You got to order extra."


1386
00:57:58.526 --> 00:58:00.798
- Chad, where are you going?
- Where are you heading?


1387
00:58:00.864 --> 00:58:03.569
I feel like she...

1388
00:58:03.637 --> 00:58:06.743
- No, whoa, whoa.
- Chad.


1389
00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:08.145
Chad.

1390
00:58:08.212 --> 00:58:10.918
Oh, no, no, no,
are you serious?


1391
00:58:10.985 --> 00:58:12.153
Chad?

1392
00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:13.289
I think it's
a really beautiful place.


1393
00:58:13.356 --> 00:58:14.458
Can you shut up for a second,
Robert,


1394
00:58:14.524 --> 00:58:16.127
- and let me finish?
- Where is Chad going?


1395
00:58:16.195 --> 00:58:18.232
Who gives a shit?

1396
00:58:18.299 --> 00:58:21.706
- Bret was right.
- Are you serious, dude?


1397
00:58:21.773 --> 00:58:23.877
Are you in here? Hey!

1398
00:58:23.944 --> 00:58:26.315
- What are you doing?
- Hey, come on, dude.


1399
00:58:26.382 --> 00:58:27.618
I knew it.

1400
00:58:27.685 --> 00:58:30.289
- Hey, back up, dude!
- What's going on?


1401
00:58:30.356 --> 00:58:32.494
- Chad, stop!
- What the hell?


1402
00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:34.599
I'm-I'm the only one who tells
the truth in these meetings.


1403
00:58:34.666 --> 00:58:36.268
- What's going on?
- What is happening?


1404
00:58:36.335 --> 00:58:37.772
- Dude, man, stop!
- Are you guys kidding me?


1405
00:58:37.838 --> 00:58:39.374
Why can't you get
your shit together


1406
00:58:39.441 --> 00:58:41.946
and have one day about Gigi?

1407
00:58:42.013 --> 00:58:43.617
I mean, she just fucking died.

1408
00:58:43.684 --> 00:58:46.388
I am so sick
of all of your problems.


1409
00:58:46.455 --> 00:58:48.627
- Stop! Get off me!
- Boys, calm down.


1410
00:58:48.694 --> 00:58:50.196
Do you believe how messed up
this really is.


1411
00:58:50.263 --> 00:58:51.599
- Fraud!
- They're acting like children.


1412
00:58:51.666 --> 00:58:53.804
- Fraud, fraud, fraud!
- I'm a fraud? You're a fraud!


1413
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:56.375
Your book isn't even a metaphor!
You just got lost!


1414
00:58:56.442 --> 00:58:58.312
That's it. That does it.
That doesn't make you wise.


1415
00:58:58.379 --> 00:58:59.548
What are you doing?

1416
00:58:59.615 --> 00:59:02.454
I'm trying to get away
from this family.


1417
00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:04.192
I'm gonna
move to Libya next time.


1418
00:59:04.257 --> 00:59:05.359
No, you're not going to Libya.

1419
00:59:05.426 --> 00:59:07.464
You are admitting
that you embezzled.


1420
00:59:07.530 --> 00:59:09.067
Oh, I'm the only one who tells
the truth in this family!


1421
00:59:09.134 --> 00:59:10.236
Fess up, right now.

1422
00:59:10.303 --> 00:59:11.305
You're the only person
in this family


1423
00:59:11.371 --> 00:59:13.175
that stole from it.

1424
00:59:13.242 --> 00:59:14.377
You stole from me!

1425
00:59:14.444 --> 00:59:17.383
I sent you my book royalties!
Admit it.


1426
00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:20.289
I'm sorry about that,
actually.


1427
00:59:20.356 --> 00:59:23.395
- Does Katie know about this?
- She knows you're here, huh?


1428
00:59:23.462 --> 00:59:25.433
- Yes.
- What about Mom?


1429
00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:27.504
- Of course Mom knows.
- I'm the favorite.


1430
00:59:28.907 --> 00:59:30.244
Fuck you!

1431
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:32.580
You didn't come to when
they rescued me by helicopter.


1432
00:59:32.648 --> 00:59:33.750
And you didn't come
to the airport


1433
00:59:33.817 --> 00:59:35.486
when they brought me home
from my parade.


1434
00:59:35.553 --> 00:59:36.956
You didn't come
to my book launch.


1435
00:59:37.023 --> 00:59:41.131
- It was self-published.
- So why would I go?


1436
00:59:41.198 --> 00:59:42.968
That is irrelevant, Robert.

1437
00:59:45.139 --> 00:59:47.645
I'm gonna love you

1438
00:59:47.711 --> 00:59:50.449
Hang around my doorstep

1439
00:59:50.516 --> 00:59:52.520
Ain't got no loose change

1440
00:59:52.587 --> 00:59:54.457
Stop, stop, stop.

1441
00:59:56.663 --> 00:59:59.167
- Same old shit, huh?
- Same old tree.


1442
00:59:59.234 --> 01:00:02.106
- Stop it. Why are you so mad?
- Do you ever think about them?


1443
01:00:02.173 --> 01:00:04.444
And yeah I faked...
I faked faking my own death.


1444
01:00:04.511 --> 01:00:06.448
I faked going to Russia.

1445
01:00:06.515 --> 01:00:08.419
I faked being the second coming
of Snowden.


1446
01:00:08.485 --> 01:00:09.822
You leaked information

1447
01:00:09.889 --> 01:00:11.993
regarding the planning
infrastructure of Newark.


1448
01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:13.897
Terrorists
could have used that.


1449
01:00:13.964 --> 01:00:15.399
- How?
- How could they have used it?


1450
01:00:15.466 --> 01:00:17.705
There should've been
a bigger deal, okay?


1451
01:00:17.771 --> 01:00:18.707
Listen, I was brave
for doing that.


1452
01:00:18.773 --> 01:00:20.644
Yes, yes, you survived death.

1453
01:00:20.711 --> 01:00:23.783
Bret had to deal
with his true love dying,


1454
01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:25.654
but I had to survive
through you from...


1455
01:00:25.721 --> 01:00:27.023
you kicked the shit out of me!

1456
01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:31.064
All the time, man.
You hurt your brother, man.


1457
01:00:31.131 --> 01:00:32.635
All I wanted to do was hang out
with you,


1458
01:00:32.701 --> 01:00:34.404
and you fucking kicked my ass.

1459
01:00:34.471 --> 01:00:36.709
- Okay, all right, fine.
- All right.


1460
01:00:36.776 --> 01:00:39.581
But you were pretty annoying,
dude.


1461
01:00:39.649 --> 01:00:41.853
- I was what?
- Annoying.


1462
01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.659
You were an annoying presence.

1463
01:00:49.167 --> 01:00:52.473
- I'm done. Let's go. Right now.
- I'm done.


1464
01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:56.749
Yeah, I was hiding.
Dad, let's go. I'm ready.


1465
01:00:56.816 --> 01:01:00.056
- Let's go where?
- Right here, right now.


1466
01:01:00.122 --> 01:01:02.628
This annoying asshole
is gonna kick your ass


1467
01:01:02.695 --> 01:01:05.334
in front of everyone on Zoom.

1468
01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.105
Let's go!

1469
01:01:08.172 --> 01:01:10.777
Swaying in the breeze now

1470
01:01:10.844 --> 01:01:12.448
Hanging on the burner

1471
01:01:12.513 --> 01:01:15.086
They're gone.

1472
01:01:15.152 --> 01:01:16.689
They're gone, bitch.

1473
01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:23.268
There are some things
you just can't do over Zoom.


1474
01:01:23.336 --> 01:01:27.845
If either of them could fight,
someone might actually get hurt.


1475
01:01:27.911 --> 01:01:31.218
Are you further apart
but closer to you family now?


1476
01:01:31.284 --> 01:01:35.092
I mean, who-who did you get
locked in with?


1477
01:01:35.159 --> 01:01:38.298
- Oh, my back.
- I know. Oh, that truly hurts.


1478
01:01:38.366 --> 01:01:40.069
Oh, my God.

1479
01:01:42.374 --> 01:01:44.712
'Cause you're fucking
everybody's favorite, man.


1480
01:01:44.779 --> 01:01:48.052
- Yeah.
- Mom's, Gigi, Katie.


1481
01:01:51.024 --> 01:01:53.162
I'm also the best-looking.

1482
01:01:53.228 --> 01:01:56.803
- Don't do that. Come here.
- You gotta crack my back.


1483
01:02:02.815 --> 01:02:06.221
One, two. God, you've gotten
so fat.


1484
01:02:06.288 --> 01:02:07.223
Yeah.

1485
01:02:08.927 --> 01:02:13.068
- Okay, Dorsey.
- What?


1486
01:02:13.135 --> 01:02:15.874
I need you to hear
what I'm about to say.


1487
01:02:15.941 --> 01:02:17.009
- Bobby, don't.
- Hear what?


1488
01:02:17.076 --> 01:02:18.947
Yeah, I'm listening. I'm here.

1489
01:02:19.013 --> 01:02:21.184
Diane, it is the problem
with this family.


1490
01:02:21.251 --> 01:02:23.823
It is why the river forks

1491
01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:25.494
and the-the-the waters
never come together.


1492
01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:28.332
- Oh, my God with the water.
- She will not understand.


1493
01:02:28.399 --> 01:02:29.334
She will understand.

1494
01:02:29.401 --> 01:02:30.670
Can someone
please fucking tell me


1495
01:02:30.737 --> 01:02:32.609
what-what is happening,
Uncle Bobby?


1496
01:02:32.674 --> 01:02:33.743
We need to decide
on this together.


1497
01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:35.447
- Mom.
- Dorsey, I'm going to tell you.


1498
01:02:35.514 --> 01:02:36.816
Don't you dare.

1499
01:02:36.883 --> 01:02:38.352
Who is the host
of this meeting?


1500
01:02:38.419 --> 01:02:40.490
- I am. I'm the...
- Katie, do you hear me?


1501
01:02:40.557 --> 01:02:42.193
Do me a favor and
mute your mother.


1502
01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:44.532
I need to put this
in... into context.


1503
01:02:44.599 --> 01:02:46.034
Okay, you got it, Uncle Bobby.

1504
01:02:46.101 --> 01:02:47.403
Katie, do not mute Mom.

1505
01:02:47.471 --> 01:02:49.775
- I need to tell you how.
- Katie, do not mute Mom!


1506
01:02:51.244 --> 01:02:55.720
Dorsey, can you just sit still
for one minute.


1507
01:02:55.787 --> 01:03:01.164
This is not easy for me,
but I am your father.


1508
01:03:04.772 --> 01:03:07.210
- Wait a minute.
- I am your dad.


1509
01:03:07.276 --> 01:03:08.412
Oh, dear God.

1510
01:03:08.479 --> 01:03:10.884
Is that like what
you're telling me right now?


1511
01:03:10.951 --> 01:03:12.320
I'm just gonna... you're telling
me.


1512
01:03:12.386 --> 01:03:13.856
I am.

1513
01:03:13.923 --> 01:03:16.027
How could you be my dad
with her?


1514
01:03:16.094 --> 01:03:18.766
That's disgusting,
and that's like an insane...


1515
01:03:18.833 --> 01:03:21.572
And that's why
that didn't happen, Dorsey.


1516
01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.876
What really happened was,

1517
01:03:23.943 --> 01:03:27.985
when you were born, your mother,
my wife,


1518
01:03:28.051 --> 01:03:31.727
Susanna, was very, very ill.

1519
01:03:31.792 --> 01:03:36.034
She did not live
a very long time.


1520
01:03:36.101 --> 01:03:38.405
I didn't know what to do.
I was upended.


1521
01:03:38.473 --> 01:03:44.653
I-I had this beautiful daughter.
I had no idea how to raise you.


1522
01:03:44.719 --> 01:03:48.158
And so I left you
with my sister,


1523
01:03:48.225 --> 01:03:50.665
who raised you as her own.

1524
01:03:50.731 --> 01:03:52.501
Good for you, Bobby.

1525
01:03:52.567 --> 01:03:56.842
- Wait, Bret, did you know this?
- Did anyone know this?


1526
01:03:56.909 --> 01:03:59.548
Okay, I just don't understand
why this is the first time


1527
01:03:59.616 --> 01:04:01.485
I'm assuming any of us
have heard about this?


1528
01:04:01.552 --> 01:04:02.854
Oh, God.

1529
01:04:02.921 --> 01:04:03.923
Holy shit!

1530
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:05.259
- Max!
- Mom.


1531
01:04:05.326 --> 01:04:06.529
Oh, my God.

1532
01:04:06.596 --> 01:04:08.165
Uh, I just need a minute.
If that's cool with everyone.


1533
01:04:08.231 --> 01:04:10.870
I think it's best if you call
me Father Bobby from now.


1534
01:04:10.937 --> 01:04:11.906
Oh, my God!

1535
01:04:11.972 --> 01:04:13.711
Why didn't either of you
tell me?


1536
01:04:13.777 --> 01:04:17.083
Because we're very good
at keeping... where did she go?


1537
01:04:17.149 --> 01:04:18.721
Dorsey, come back here.

1538
01:04:18.787 --> 01:04:21.124
I am not coming back here!

1539
01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:24.364
I-I think I just... I just need
a minute


1540
01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:26.034
'cause I don't fucking
understand


1541
01:04:26.101 --> 01:04:29.207
what the fuck is happening
right now.


1542
01:04:29.273 --> 01:04:32.648
Katie, can you just fucking
unmute Mom for a minute?


1543
01:04:32.715 --> 01:04:34.719
And now I'm really pissed
that you've been gone


1544
01:04:34.786 --> 01:04:38.225
for so many goddamn years!

1545
01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:40.897
Max.

1546
01:04:40.964 --> 01:04:42.602
Mom?

1547
01:05:35.072 --> 01:05:37.712
Hey, Max?

1548
01:05:37.778 --> 01:05:40.985
Will you put your dirty clothes
in a laundry bag, please?


1549
01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:43.154
I'm gonna pass out.

1550
01:05:45.526 --> 01:05:47.965
I bought a big bottle
of vodka.


1551
01:05:48.031 --> 01:05:50.502
That's weird.

1552
01:05:50.569 --> 01:05:52.007
- What's-what's weird?
- What-what do you mean?


1553
01:05:52.072 --> 01:05:53.508
What? Which one?

1554
01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:56.214
Well, normally you put two
ice cubes


1555
01:05:56.281 --> 01:05:58.418
in a glass
of buttery Chardonnay.


1556
01:05:58.485 --> 01:06:01.860
Well, there's shit about me
you don't know.


1557
01:06:01.927 --> 01:06:03.194
Okay, okay.

1558
01:06:03.261 --> 01:06:05.065
Okay, Dorsey is gonna be on
in one second.


1559
01:06:05.132 --> 01:06:09.842
Oh, no, I'm... I don't know
what to do.


1560
01:06:09.909 --> 01:06:12.346
I don't know what to say.

1561
01:06:12.413 --> 01:06:14.216
I... you're gonna
have to-to help me.


1562
01:06:14.283 --> 01:06:16.990
Hey, I think you should
just be your... don't, no.


1563
01:06:17.057 --> 01:06:18.627
I think,

1564
01:06:18.694 --> 01:06:22.198
don't be your controlling self,
be your loving self.


1565
01:06:23.936 --> 01:06:26.440
- My loving self.
- You did everything right.


1566
01:06:26.506 --> 01:06:28.310
You're just... you weren't
a good liar.


1567
01:06:28.377 --> 01:06:31.719
What? No one knew
until Bobby told everyone.


1568
01:06:31.785 --> 01:06:33.756
- No, I knew you had a secret.
- Blurting it out.


1569
01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:35.257
We all knew
there was something.


1570
01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:36.526
What? No, you didn't.

1571
01:06:36.594 --> 01:06:37.998
There-there has always been

1572
01:06:38.064 --> 01:06:39.432
something just furious in you.

1573
01:06:39.499 --> 01:06:40.937
- There has not.
- There was.


1574
01:06:41.004 --> 01:06:45.211
And we all had our own theories
that messed us up.


1575
01:06:45.277 --> 01:06:47.049
You know,
in a totally bespoke way, but...


1576
01:06:47.116 --> 01:06:48.686
Just bespoke. What?

1577
01:06:48.753 --> 01:06:50.287
I don't even know
what that means.


1578
01:06:50.354 --> 01:06:53.227
Doesn't it mean customized?

1579
01:06:53.293 --> 01:06:54.698
Does it?

1580
01:07:03.683 --> 01:07:04.885
Hi, Mom.

1581
01:07:09.459 --> 01:07:13.500
Oh, stop. Stop.

1582
01:07:13.567 --> 01:07:14.938
Hi, baby.

1583
01:07:15.005 --> 01:07:18.277
The drama of this family.

1584
01:07:18.343 --> 01:07:19.781
I have two daughters,

1585
01:07:19.848 --> 01:07:22.854
and I'll always have
two daughters.


1586
01:07:22.921 --> 01:07:25.391
Yes. Yes.

1587
01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:27.797
Look, I'm okay. I'm okay.

1588
01:07:27.864 --> 01:07:30.434
I, uh, I just did a...

1589
01:07:31.604 --> 01:07:35.145
A two-hour
emergency therapy session.


1590
01:07:35.212 --> 01:07:38.017
Don't worry, I'm gonna ask you
to join next week.


1591
01:07:38.084 --> 01:07:41.792
We can talk about that later.
Both of you, Katie.


1592
01:07:41.859 --> 01:07:43.829
Well, let me just say,
I always had a plan.


1593
01:07:43.896 --> 01:07:47.136
I had a plan.
You weren't gonna stay.


1594
01:07:47.202 --> 01:07:51.979
I was gonna take care of you for
a while, and then time went by,


1595
01:07:52.045 --> 01:07:53.983
and then it was too long,

1596
01:07:54.049 --> 01:07:56.922
so I thought it'd be devastating
to you,


1597
01:07:56.989 --> 01:08:01.563
and I just hope this isn't
too devastating to you instead.


1598
01:08:01.631 --> 01:08:03.168
Oh, I'm, like,
properly fucked up.


1599
01:08:03.234 --> 01:08:04.569
But don't worry.

1600
01:08:04.637 --> 01:08:07.341
I'm gonna be, like... we're gonna
be okay.


1601
01:08:07.408 --> 01:08:08.813
Well, yeah.

1602
01:08:08.879 --> 01:08:10.282
And I'm so
happy you didn't leave me


1603
01:08:10.347 --> 01:08:13.121
with that fucking fuck up.

1604
01:08:13.188 --> 01:08:15.192
I mean, Bobby is a nightmare.

1605
01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:17.997
And trust me, it takes one
to know one, I know.


1606
01:08:18.064 --> 01:08:22.172
And I-I just can't even imagine,
like, what would my life be like


1607
01:08:22.239 --> 01:08:25.544
if it wasn't for you guys?
I'm a part of this family.


1608
01:08:25.612 --> 01:08:27.182
It's not like you picked me up
out of a dumpster


1609
01:08:27.249 --> 01:08:28.550
and forgot to tell me that.

1610
01:08:28.618 --> 01:08:31.859
I mean, I am...
I mean, that's not true, right?


1611
01:08:31.925 --> 01:08:33.896
- No, honey.
- Okay. Okay.


1612
01:08:33.963 --> 01:08:35.564
- We don't know.
- I mean, that's it.


1613
01:08:35.632 --> 01:08:37.770
There's nothing else
I need to know, right?


1614
01:08:37.837 --> 01:08:39.405
No.

1615
01:08:39.472 --> 01:08:42.679
I, um, I also just felt like
I needed to tell you, Katie,


1616
01:08:42.746 --> 01:08:44.750
is that, even though
it's not my fault,


1617
01:08:44.818 --> 01:08:46.453
I just think that you would have
really kicked ass


1618
01:08:46.519 --> 01:08:47.957
at being the only girl

1619
01:08:48.024 --> 01:08:49.693
and all the light
would be shining on you,


1620
01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:51.230
and I feel
like you deserve that, and...


1621
01:08:51.297 --> 01:08:52.867
You're insane.

1622
01:08:52.934 --> 01:08:56.140
You're acting like this ruined
my life or you ruined my life.


1623
01:08:56.207 --> 01:08:59.848
No one ruined my life.
I messed it up.


1624
01:08:59.915 --> 01:09:04.858
Kevin-Kevin and I have split up.
That little bitch.


1625
01:09:04.925 --> 01:09:06.661
But I'm... because
I'm too controlling


1626
01:09:06.727 --> 01:09:08.064
and I've
-I've been controlling.

1627
01:09:08.131 --> 01:09:10.335
I always thought being
controlling was a good thing,


1628
01:09:10.402 --> 01:09:12.372
is that... it was
about being strong


1629
01:09:12.438 --> 01:09:14.276
Well, we come by it naturally.

1630
01:09:14.343 --> 01:09:16.247
Yes, you do.

1631
01:09:16.314 --> 01:09:20.454
And my mother... my mother
was very controlling.


1632
01:09:20.521 --> 01:09:22.558
Look at how
she controlled this.


1633
01:09:22.626 --> 01:09:24.797
She did, the bitch.

1634
01:09:24.864 --> 01:09:27.302
- She did.
- The bitch.


1635
01:09:27.369 --> 01:09:29.073
She's still doing it.

1636
01:09:29.139 --> 01:09:32.478
But Dorsey, seriously, I will
be treating you like a cousin


1637
01:09:32.545 --> 01:09:34.049
from here on out,
and you'll always be.


1638
01:09:34.116 --> 01:09:35.517
I think that might be
a good thing.


1639
01:09:37.957 --> 01:09:40.128
I don't know how the boys are
going to treat me from now on


1640
01:09:40.195 --> 01:09:42.165
'cause you know, they're gonna
just give me an endless amount


1641
01:09:42.232 --> 01:09:43.668
of shit about this, right?

1642
01:09:43.735 --> 01:09:46.741
Like, it's gonna be
never-ending.


1643
01:09:46.807 --> 01:09:48.478
Just like it always has been.

1644
01:09:48.543 --> 01:09:51.183
You should be happy
that they're not your brothers.


1645
01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:53.087
That I...

1646
01:09:53.154 --> 01:09:57.262
I wish... what I would give
to not be their sister.


1647
01:09:57.329 --> 01:09:59.666
And I don't believe that
for a minute.


1648
01:10:06.747 --> 01:10:10.088
Max. Max!

1649
01:10:10.155 --> 01:10:12.325
What?

1650
01:10:12.392 --> 01:10:14.630
Let's go home.

1651
01:10:14.696 --> 01:10:16.200
Where's that?

1652
01:10:20.008 --> 01:10:22.880
Diane, I can't hear
a word you're saying.


1653
01:10:22.947 --> 01:10:25.185
I can't hear anything at all
that you're saying.


1654
01:10:25.251 --> 01:10:27.722
Diane, I can't hear you.

1655
01:10:27.789 --> 01:10:29.259
No, no.
Don't-don't give a speech.


1656
01:10:29.326 --> 01:10:32.766
Diane, Diane,
let's go to the phone.


1657
01:10:32.833 --> 01:10:34.670
Okay, just-just wait.

1658
01:10:34.736 --> 01:10:36.340
Since the day we met.

1659
01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:44.389
Yeah. Yup.

1660
01:10:44.456 --> 01:10:47.429
Um. Uh.

1661
01:10:47.496 --> 01:10:48.599
Thank you.

1662
01:10:48.664 --> 01:10:52.839
And I would say, 
I think the...

1663
01:10:52.907 --> 01:10:55.211
the way I would see it.

1664
01:10:55.278 --> 01:10:59.686
I froze for the whole fucking
speech, didn't I?


1665
01:10:59.753 --> 01:11:01.724
Yeah, you did.

1666
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:04.062
Ugh, ugh.

1667
01:11:04.129 --> 01:11:08.137
It's like watching
the fucking Jetsons.


1668
01:11:08.204 --> 01:11:10.308
All the little boxes,
all the little squares,


1669
01:11:10.375 --> 01:11:13.481
everyone lined up
like we're all the same.


1670
01:11:13.548 --> 01:11:16.820
Honestly, it's fascism
when you boil it down.


1671
01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:20.061
A part of me wants
to never tell you


1672
01:11:20.128 --> 01:11:23.768
what the speech was about,
Judith.


1673
01:11:23.834 --> 01:11:25.673
Yeah, well, a part of me
was gonna say


1674
01:11:25.738 --> 01:11:27.709
I heard the whole thing.

1675
01:11:29.846 --> 01:11:32.118
How are you feeling?
How are you doing?


1676
01:11:32.185 --> 01:11:37.997
Oh, I feel tired, confused.

1677
01:11:38.064 --> 01:11:40.568
I feel a lot of regret, Judith.

1678
01:11:40.636 --> 01:11:43.374
- Ugh.
- I'm not missing her.


1679
01:11:45.078 --> 01:11:48.751
I've been missing her
for 20 years.


1680
01:11:48.818 --> 01:11:51.390
Well, she missed you too.

1681
01:11:51.457 --> 01:11:53.595
She talked about you
all the time.


1682
01:11:53.662 --> 01:11:57.202
A part of me was always scared

1683
01:11:57.269 --> 01:12:00.541
to see you the first few times
that we were together.


1684
01:12:03.014 --> 01:12:06.120
Figured she told you her version
of me.


1685
01:12:06.186 --> 01:12:08.625
Figured she told you
about Dorsey.


1686
01:12:08.692 --> 01:12:10.996
She did, but I'll tell you

1687
01:12:11.063 --> 01:12:12.966
the only thing I ever thought
about you


1688
01:12:13.034 --> 01:12:17.008
was what an incredibly
strong woman you had to be.


1689
01:12:17.075 --> 01:12:19.813
In that position?

1690
01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:22.018
I mean, you raised five kids.

1691
01:12:22.085 --> 01:12:24.189
I found you intimidating.

1692
01:12:24.256 --> 01:12:27.997
And I found you admirable
like Mabel.


1693
01:12:28.064 --> 01:12:30.268
Thank you.

1694
01:12:30.335 --> 01:12:33.207
I regret
not knowing you better, Judith.


1695
01:12:33.274 --> 01:12:37.048
That was the gist
of my speech, truly.


1696
01:12:38.918 --> 01:12:43.094
And I'm sorry that
you couldn't be with her.


1697
01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.697
Well, she didn't want me
there.


1698
01:12:44.764 --> 01:12:46.835
That's crazy.

1699
01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:50.141
No, she really didn't.

1700
01:12:50.208 --> 01:12:53.280
Oh, that's just like
my mother.


1701
01:12:53.347 --> 01:12:58.391
She wants everyone around
and to be left the fuck alone.


1702
01:13:01.230 --> 01:13:04.871
- Yeah.
- She loves you, right?


1703
01:13:04.936 --> 01:13:06.674
I know that.

1704
01:13:07.877 --> 01:13:09.913
Thank you.

1705
01:13:34.996 --> 01:13:37.268
What the hell?

1706
01:13:40.909 --> 01:13:43.012
Hello, come in, over.

1707
01:13:44.182 --> 01:13:45.652
Hey, Dad.

1708
01:13:45.719 --> 01:13:48.257
I wanna try out a new
communication strategy, over.


1709
01:13:48.324 --> 01:13:50.528
Yeah, well, it's analog

1710
01:13:50.596 --> 01:13:53.267
'cause some hacker broke
into my computer


1711
01:13:53.334 --> 01:13:56.975
and has been monitoring
my every move, so.


1712
01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.214
Well, maybe the hacker didn't
know what else to do, you know.


1713
01:14:00.281 --> 01:14:04.222
Maybe he was a hacker who had
a whole hacker family,


1714
01:14:04.289 --> 01:14:06.093
and in that hacker family,

1715
01:14:06.159 --> 01:14:07.796
he was the parent
that didn't exactly know


1716
01:14:07.863 --> 01:14:10.101
what to say at the right time.

1717
01:14:10.167 --> 01:14:12.940
Or how to say the right thing.

1718
01:14:13.007 --> 01:14:14.242
Maybe he didn't understand what

1719
01:14:14.309 --> 01:14:15.779
his little girl was trying
to say to him


1720
01:14:15.846 --> 01:14:20.956
because that was... that was
the mom's job.


1721
01:14:21.023 --> 01:14:23.929
And the mom and the daughter
in this hacker family,


1722
01:14:23.995 --> 01:14:25.498
they had this secret language

1723
01:14:25.565 --> 01:14:28.137
that they just... they just
got each other.


1724
01:14:28.203 --> 01:14:32.110
They just had this instant,
beautiful connection, and...


1725
01:14:35.051 --> 01:14:37.723
And then she died.

1726
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:41.363
And he wasn't ready for that,
even though he should have been


1727
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:44.169
because he had
a whole fucking year.


1728
01:14:44.235 --> 01:14:47.275
And still he wasn't ready.

1729
01:14:47.342 --> 01:14:50.014
And he forgot to learn
the language.


1730
01:14:50.081 --> 01:14:54.857
And now he's losing her slowly.
And he can't lose her too.


1731
01:14:58.297 --> 01:15:00.802
He's not losing her, over.

1732
01:15:05.211 --> 01:15:06.881
I fucked up, Cas.

1733
01:15:08.785 --> 01:15:10.521
I shouldn't have let you
been there when she died.


1734
01:15:10.588 --> 01:15:13.260
It was too much.
That was too hard.


1735
01:15:13.327 --> 01:15:17.135
You know, I still think
about it all the time.


1736
01:15:17.201 --> 01:15:19.907
I know. I'm sorry.

1737
01:15:21.911 --> 01:15:23.948
We saw her leave.

1738
01:15:24.015 --> 01:15:27.321
I think it's proof that there
are other worlds out there.


1739
01:15:27.388 --> 01:15:28.758
That's nice, Cas.

1740
01:15:28.825 --> 01:15:31.530
I mean, as we do some more
deep space exploration,


1741
01:15:31.597 --> 01:15:33.300
we'll get real proof of there
being other worlds,


1742
01:15:33.367 --> 01:15:34.335
but you know.

1743
01:15:34.402 --> 01:15:36.239
Stop talking about space.

1744
01:15:39.512 --> 01:15:43.621
You know, she said I had
to take care of you somehow.


1745
01:15:43.688 --> 01:15:45.759
No, you don't have to do that.

1746
01:15:47.196 --> 01:15:48.897
It's not fair.

1747
01:15:48.964 --> 01:15:50.868
You shouldn't have been
asked that.


1748
01:15:50.935 --> 01:15:51.937
I know.

1749
01:15:52.003 --> 01:15:58.549
But she was on morphine,
so yeah, I get it.


1750
01:15:58.617 --> 01:16:01.656
We should talk more.

1751
01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:05.231
And, hey, keep the old can
charged up.


1752
01:16:14.515 --> 01:16:18.055
Hello, I am shark
from the deep ocean.


1753
01:16:20.227 --> 01:16:21.395
Hi, Bobby.

1754
01:16:21.462 --> 01:16:22.598
Wait a minute,
how did you know?


1755
01:16:22.665 --> 01:16:24.501
Who-who is the Bobby
you talk of?


1756
01:16:24.568 --> 01:16:25.838
Do you wanna talk to my mom?

1757
01:16:25.905 --> 01:16:29.211
- Is she in a good mood?
- I'll see.


1758
01:16:29.279 --> 01:16:31.115
Okay, yeah. Well then, okay.

1759
01:16:31.182 --> 01:16:32.584
And just so you know,

1760
01:16:32.652 --> 01:16:34.021
I'm really glad I have
a grandpa now.


1761
01:16:34.087 --> 01:16:36.893
I've never really had one
before, you know?


1762
01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:39.866
I am so glad
I have you in my life too.


1763
01:16:39.933 --> 01:16:41.135
Me too.

1764
01:16:41.202 --> 01:16:42.571
Perhaps Bobby will be

1765
01:16:42.638 --> 01:16:45.009
a better grandparent
than parent.


1766
01:16:45.076 --> 01:16:46.478
We can only hope so.

1767
01:16:46.545 --> 01:16:48.817
- Mom, it's your dad.
- He's a shark.


1768
01:16:48.884 --> 01:16:51.422
This is a shark
from the very deep ocean.


1769
01:16:51.488 --> 01:16:54.629
I'm from the very...

1770
01:16:54.696 --> 01:16:55.731
All right, that was stupid.

1771
01:16:55.798 --> 01:16:57.802
Okay, let me transform. Hold it.

1772
01:16:57.869 --> 01:17:00.073
I'll put that. Here I am. Hi.

1773
01:17:00.139 --> 01:17:02.912
I-I thought, you know,
that would be a, like,


1774
01:17:02.979 --> 01:17:07.220
a great disguise
to a work around Max.


1775
01:17:07.288 --> 01:17:09.926
- Why do you need a disguise?
- Max doesn't care.


1776
01:17:09.993 --> 01:17:13.700
Yeah, but you know, this is
a very important moment for me,


1777
01:17:13.767 --> 01:17:15.503
and I
-I didn't want to miss it,

1778
01:17:15.570 --> 01:17:18.677
and I-I-I wanted so badly
to talk to you, but...


1779
01:17:18.744 --> 01:17:20.981
- You know, I guessed it once.
- When?


1780
01:17:21.048 --> 01:17:23.152
It was at Grandma's

1781
01:17:23.219 --> 01:17:24.989
- Huh.
- I don't know, I must've been,


1782
01:17:25.056 --> 01:17:27.093
like, 11 or 12, and you were
playing with all the kids,


1783
01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.095
and you were running around

1784
01:17:28.162 --> 01:17:30.668
and I thought,
"He runs like I run."


1785
01:17:30.734 --> 01:17:31.937
- You know what?
- I remember that day.


1786
01:17:32.003 --> 01:17:33.139
Yeah.

1787
01:17:33.205 --> 01:17:34.508
It was a wonderful day,

1788
01:17:34.574 --> 01:17:37.180
and I am so sorry
for the inheritance.


1789
01:17:37.247 --> 01:17:40.286
I like how I run.

1790
01:17:40.354 --> 01:17:44.061
I have so many things
I wanna tell you, Dorsey.


1791
01:17:44.127 --> 01:17:48.637
I just... I don't know... I don't
know how to say I'm sorry.


1792
01:17:48.704 --> 01:17:52.445
I mean, I have, like...

1793
01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:55.417
- I have a million questions.
- I know.


1794
01:17:55.483 --> 01:17:59.826
You can't even understand
how crazy I feel right now.


1795
01:17:59.892 --> 01:18:03.667
But before-before we even do
any of this,


1796
01:18:03.734 --> 01:18:05.604
you have to know
that Bill is my dad.


1797
01:18:05.671 --> 01:18:07.908
- Finally, someone mentions me.
- He's my dad.


1798
01:18:07.975 --> 01:18:11.148
- It took them long enough.
- I'm Bill, Diane's husband.


1799
01:18:11.215 --> 01:18:13.887
Okay, and-and the day he died
was the worst day of my life.


1800
01:18:13.954 --> 01:18:18.262
- Heart attack in '98.
- It was fast, no sympathy needed.


1801
01:18:18.329 --> 01:18:21.803
And there's no way this guy
will ever replace me.


1802
01:18:21.870 --> 01:18:25.043
I-I do not want
to take Bill's place.


1803
01:18:25.109 --> 01:18:29.584
I just want my own little place
in your heart if I could.


1804
01:18:29.652 --> 01:18:33.960
It just... and then maybe
it'll grow, and...


1805
01:18:34.027 --> 01:18:37.233
but I know... I know
Bill is your dad.


1806
01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:38.603
I know that. I know that.

1807
01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:42.711
I gave that up
a long, a long time ago.


1808
01:18:42.778 --> 01:18:45.884
I need a little time,
all right? Okay.


1809
01:18:45.951 --> 01:18:47.755
Can I... can I talk
to you again?


1810
01:18:47.822 --> 01:18:49.692
Yes, of course.

1811
01:18:49.759 --> 01:18:51.161
I just... I'm not ready yet.

1812
01:18:51.228 --> 01:18:53.733
Okay, this is the shark
saying goodbye.


1813
01:18:55.369 --> 01:18:57.608
I don't wanna laugh right now.

1814
01:18:57.675 --> 01:19:00.914
- Can I just say one more thing?
- You should be very proud of Max.


1815
01:19:00.981 --> 01:19:02.551
He is so perceptive.

1816
01:19:02.618 --> 01:19:04.755
He somehow... he knew I was
the shark.


1817
01:19:04.822 --> 01:19:07.060
Okay, that's good for now,
all right?


1818
01:19:08.864 --> 01:19:10.667
- Bye.
- Bye.


1819
01:19:16.813 --> 01:19:20.086
I was standing

1820
01:19:20.153 --> 01:19:22.958
By my window

1821
01:19:23.025 --> 01:19:29.037
On a dark and cloudy day

1822
01:19:29.104 --> 01:19:35.383
Will the circle be unbroken

1823
01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:41.630
By and by, Lord, by and by?

1824
01:19:41.696 --> 01:19:48.577
There's a better home awaiting

1825
01:19:48.644 --> 01:19:52.652
In the sky

1826
01:19:52.718 --> 01:19:54.789
Well, that was beautiful.

1827
01:19:54.855 --> 01:19:55.958
Yeah, I'm really glad
you all decided


1828
01:19:56.024 --> 01:19:57.761
to do a digital service,
you know,


1829
01:19:57.828 --> 01:20:00.333
and you know, maybe when things
are safer and we're cleared up,


1830
01:20:00.399 --> 01:20:01.335
we can do a full service,

1831
01:20:01.401 --> 01:20:03.573
you know,
in person, the whole shebang.


1832
01:20:03.641 --> 01:20:06.278
And now for the final video.

1833
01:20:06.345 --> 01:20:09.785
- I'm back! Just kidding.
- Still dead.


1834
01:20:09.852 --> 01:20:14.394
Welcome to the final installment
of my last will and testament.


1835
01:20:14.462 --> 01:20:18.102
You've hopefully decided
where to bury my ashes,


1836
01:20:18.168 --> 01:20:21.041
and it better be the place
I'm thinking of.


1837
01:20:21.108 --> 01:20:25.449
The only place I ever really
felt like we were a family


1838
01:20:25.517 --> 01:20:26.754
and that you've invited

1839
01:20:26.819 --> 01:20:29.324
my young,
gorgeous, and sexy wife.


1840
01:20:31.061 --> 01:20:33.533
I know I dropped some bombs.

1841
01:20:33.601 --> 01:20:37.776
I'd say I was sorry,
but that would be a lie.


1842
01:20:37.841 --> 01:20:40.046
I hope you're all healing.

1843
01:20:40.112 --> 01:20:43.185
Life is full of secrets,
but it's better without any,


1844
01:20:43.252 --> 01:20:45.456
and I leveled the playing field.

1845
01:20:45.524 --> 01:20:49.130
I want you to love each other
the way I love all of you:


1846
01:20:49.197 --> 01:20:52.136
unconditionally
and unapologetically.


1847
01:20:52.203 --> 01:20:54.743
So if you haven't yet,
forgive yourselves,


1848
01:20:54.810 --> 01:20:56.979
and then you can forgive
each other.


1849
01:20:57.046 --> 01:20:59.217
You're not perfect.
None of us are.


1850
01:20:59.284 --> 01:21:01.154
Give each other
a second chance...


1851
01:21:01.221 --> 01:21:03.425
or in Bret's case,
a third chance.


1852
01:21:03.492 --> 01:21:06.532
Or in Chad's case,
a fourth chance.


1853
01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:07.868
I'm kidding.

1854
01:21:07.935 --> 01:21:10.406
I love you both,
but you get what I mean.


1855
01:21:10.473 --> 01:21:12.978
You're family.
We've gotta stick together.


1856
01:21:13.045 --> 01:21:15.618
Lastly, the rumor's true.

1857
01:21:15.685 --> 01:21:19.424
There's something of value
at the farm.


1858
01:21:19.491 --> 01:21:21.495
Finders keepers.

1859
01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:33.051
I love you all so much.

1860
01:21:33.118 --> 01:21:34.187
- Me, too, Mama.
- I love you, Mama.


1861
01:21:34.254 --> 01:21:35.658
Love you too, son.

1862
01:21:35.725 --> 01:21:38.495
Don't cry, Mom, it makes me cry.

1863
01:21:38.563 --> 01:21:39.833
Love you guys.

1864
01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:42.470
- Bobby?
- Yeah.


1865
01:21:42.537 --> 01:21:44.240
I wanna say I'm sorry.

1866
01:21:44.307 --> 01:21:48.282
I-I thank you so much
for that.


1867
01:21:48.348 --> 01:21:49.317
Yeah.

1868
01:21:51.824 --> 01:21:53.258
Love you, Dorsey.

1869
01:21:53.325 --> 01:21:55.329
I love you, Katie.

1870
01:21:55.396 --> 01:21:58.368
Yeah, love you, cuz.

1871
01:21:58.435 --> 01:22:02.176
Hey, guys, maybe we'll get
along better now.


1872
01:22:02.243 --> 01:22:05.216
Dorsey, are you ready
to let me into your life?


1873
01:22:05.282 --> 01:22:07.755
- I'm never gonna call you dad.
- I'm sorry.


1874
01:22:07.822 --> 01:22:11.428
- How about papa?
- I think... I think Bobby's good.


1875
01:22:11.495 --> 01:22:15.369
I think we're good.
But I'm always calling you mom.


1876
01:22:15.436 --> 01:22:17.573
Well, I will always be
your mother.


1877
01:22:19.210 --> 01:22:22.016
And your mother,
and your mother,


1878
01:22:22.083 --> 01:22:25.858
and your mother,
and your mother.


1879
01:22:25.925 --> 01:22:28.028
And of course, my granddaughter.

1880
01:22:28.095 --> 01:22:32.069
And your sister
and your friend, Judith.


1881
01:22:32.136 --> 01:22:36.278
- I appreciate that.
- I appreciate all of you.


1882
01:22:36.344 --> 01:22:40.020
And boy, did Mabel love you.
Every single one of you.


1883
01:22:40.085 --> 01:22:44.629
Hey, Judith as-as soon
as COVID's over,


1884
01:22:44.696 --> 01:22:46.934
I was gonna grab my brothers
and drive up to New York.


1885
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:47.902
I have a meeting
with the publisher


1886
01:22:47.969 --> 01:22:49.137
about another book.

1887
01:22:49.203 --> 01:22:51.308
- Oh, stop.
- Come on.


1888
01:22:51.374 --> 01:22:52.745
What I wanted to say is,

1889
01:22:52.812 --> 01:22:55.482
it would be wonderful
to take you out to dinner


1890
01:22:55.549 --> 01:22:57.553
and meet you face to face.

1891
01:22:57.622 --> 01:22:59.424
I would love that. Thank you.

1892
01:22:59.490 --> 01:23:01.261
Well, Judith, if you want,
you know,


1893
01:23:01.328 --> 01:23:05.235
Bret's single,
and the way I see it, I mean.


1894
01:23:05.302 --> 01:23:06.807
Mm-mm, hop on that train.

1895
01:23:06.873 --> 01:23:09.110
Well, that's kinda awkward.

1896
01:23:09.177 --> 01:23:11.082
What, Katie? Spread the love.

1897
01:23:11.147 --> 01:23:16.458
- Katie's single too, right?
- I am single-ish, yes.


1898
01:23:16.524 --> 01:23:17.729
Judith?

1899
01:23:17.795 --> 01:23:21.770
- Yes, dearest. Here I am.
- New York City.


1900
01:23:21.837 --> 01:23:23.538
Judith, we're keeping you
in this family somehow.


1901
01:23:23.606 --> 01:23:25.945
Yeah, you can't escape us.

1902
01:23:26.012 --> 01:23:29.450
You are one wild, crazy group.

1903
01:23:29.517 --> 01:23:30.888
You should try it
from the outside.


1904
01:23:33.392 --> 01:23:36.933
Honest to God, I've never seen
anything like it.


1905
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.879
- Oh, I love you all so much.
- Love you guys.


1906
01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:51.963
So yeah, you can record them.

1907
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:56.672
So I've been recording this one,
and that's about it, Gigi.


1908
01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:58.275
So I can take care of the rest.

1909
01:23:58.341 --> 01:24:00.848
I can send out the invitations
and stuff,


1910
01:24:00.915 --> 01:24:02.685
and all you need to do

1911
01:24:02.752 --> 01:24:06.860
is just connect on your computer
or iPad or whatever.


1912
01:24:06.927 --> 01:24:10.265
And they'll all appear
one by one.


1913
01:24:10.332 --> 01:24:14.507
How do they all fit
on the screen?


1914
01:24:14.574 --> 01:24:16.947
The boxes get smaller.

1915
01:24:17.013 --> 01:24:20.519
That's what time does
to your family, actually.


1916
01:24:20.586 --> 01:24:22.456
You start off with a little baby

1917
01:24:22.523 --> 01:24:24.293
and a chair
in the middle of the night,


1918
01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:26.132
just the two of you.

1919
01:24:26.198 --> 01:24:29.138
And then more people come,
and they get further.


1920
01:24:29.204 --> 01:24:32.244
And then when you're my age,
whenever you look at them,


1921
01:24:32.309 --> 01:24:36.887
it's like looking through
an old yearbook or something.


1922
01:24:36.953 --> 01:24:39.057
I hate my yearbook.

1923
01:24:39.124 --> 01:24:40.861
Why, dear?

1924
01:24:40.928 --> 01:24:44.268
- I hate the kids at school.
- They make fun of me.


1925
01:24:44.333 --> 01:24:46.304
They think
I'm crazy or something.


1926
01:24:46.371 --> 01:24:49.443
I don't know, maybe I am crazy.

1927
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:54.721
- Cassidy, look at me.
- You're not crazy.


1928
01:24:54.789 --> 01:24:57.227
You just loved her,
and she loved you.


1929
01:24:57.294 --> 01:24:59.631
And so does your father.

1930
01:24:59.698 --> 01:25:03.172
- I just miss her.
- I know.


1931
01:25:03.239 --> 01:25:08.049
You know, I think death
is kind of beautiful.


1932
01:25:08.115 --> 01:25:09.651
Does that sound weird?

1933
01:25:09.718 --> 01:25:13.425
Yeah, to be honest,
it-it does.


1934
01:25:13.491 --> 01:25:18.034
From where I'm sitting,
it's a little scary.


1935
01:25:18.101 --> 01:25:21.007
Yeah, I don't know, though,
it's just...


1936
01:25:22.408 --> 01:25:24.714
Death is so, you know,

1937
01:25:24.781 --> 01:25:28.688
just happens,
and then it's a fact.


1938
01:25:28.755 --> 01:25:31.862
Death is kinda... it's true.
I don't know.


1939
01:25:31.929 --> 01:25:34.767
I just... I think that's
kind of beautiful.


1940
01:25:38.275 --> 01:25:41.180
Send those invitations out.

1941
01:25:41.247 --> 01:25:42.716
Just did.

1942
01:25:44.452 --> 01:25:47.226
See you there, Grandma.

1943
01:25:47.293 --> 01:25:48.863
See ya.

1944
01:26:07.934 --> 01:26:11.040
Dad? Dad?

1945
01:26:11.107 --> 01:26:13.278
What's up, sugar plum?

1946
01:26:13.345 --> 01:26:14.512
I'm coming down for dinner.

1947
01:26:14.579 --> 01:26:15.984
Okay.

1948
01:26:17.585 --> 01:26:20.659
Some kind of sweet relief

1949
01:26:20.726 --> 01:26:25.102
I hope you never leave

1950
01:26:25.168 --> 01:26:31.080
It's all the same to me

1951
01:26:31.147 --> 01:26:34.120
Just bring yourself

1952
01:26:34.186 --> 01:26:38.228
You know your presence
is present enough


1953
01:26:38.294 --> 01:26:41.667
- I left you in a...
- in an impossible position.


1954
01:26:41.734 --> 01:26:43.973
You were... you were incredible,
Diane.


1955
01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:46.576
You were incredible to
her, Mom, Dad.


1956
01:26:46.644 --> 01:26:48.681
You-you
could have tried harder.


1957
01:26:48.748 --> 01:26:51.922
Don't you think if I knew how,
I would have?


1958
01:26:51.989 --> 01:26:56.230
You could have made it
so I didn't have to lie to her.


1959
01:26:56.297 --> 01:26:59.637
I know. I know.

1960
01:26:59.703 --> 01:27:01.307
Hey, Robert,
are you gonna pretend


1961
01:27:01.374 --> 01:27:03.244
to live in Paris this year?

1962
01:27:03.311 --> 01:27:07.052
I've heard the fake weather
is really lovely in the fall.


1963
01:27:07.119 --> 01:27:10.993
Give me my cappuccino
and a little cigarette.


1964
01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:13.231
Wait, are you Italian now?

1965
01:27:13.298 --> 01:27:14.500
I'm
-I'm a nomad, dude.

1966
01:27:14.567 --> 01:27:16.537
Oh, my God.

1967
01:27:16.637 --> 01:27:18.641
I can't deal with it anymore.

1968
01:27:18.708 --> 01:27:20.846
I'm gonna shoot
this frigging rooster.


1969
01:27:20.913 --> 01:27:22.382
Who's he shooting?

1970
01:27:22.449 --> 01:27:23.953
He said the rooster?

1971
01:27:24.019 --> 01:27:26.190
Do we have a rooster
on the farm?


1972
01:27:26.257 --> 01:27:27.292
Hi, Judith.

1973
01:27:27.359 --> 01:27:29.965
Hi, can I hire
you for another task?


1974
01:27:30.031 --> 01:27:34.540
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- I'm-I'm driving now.


1975
01:27:34.608 --> 01:27:38.715
Um, I-I fell and I-I bruised
my... my tailbone so now


1976
01:27:38.781 --> 01:27:40.987
I'm on this, like, donut thing,
so.


1977
01:27:41.053 --> 01:27:44.126
- You know what I was thinking?
- What?


1978
01:27:44.193 --> 01:27:48.902
Maybe I would take a ride
to Spring Hope.


1979
01:27:48.969 --> 01:27:50.572
Are you kidding me?

1980
01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.543
I'm-I'm honestly
gonna do that.


1981
01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:54.346
Baby, I'll meet you there.

1982
01:27:54.413 --> 01:27:57.352
Just do me one favor.

1983
01:27:57.419 --> 01:27:58.254
What?

1984
01:27:58.321 --> 01:28:00.325
Don't yell at me
when you see me.


1985
01:28:02.095 --> 01:28:03.798
Well, I can't promise you
that, Bobby.


1986
01:28:03.865 --> 01:28:05.970
Could you promise
that you'll try?


1987
01:28:06.037 --> 01:28:09.109
- I'll try.
- I can't ask for more.


1988
01:28:09.176 --> 01:28:11.514
- I'd love to.
- I can't talk anymore.


1989
01:28:11.581 --> 01:28:13.351
Okay, bye.

1990
01:28:13.418 --> 01:28:15.889
Bye.

1991
01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:16.959
- No, it does not.
- That's not how it works.


1992
01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:17.994
- Let me try.
- One at a time.


1993
01:28:18.061 --> 01:28:19.129
It's a one at a time thing!

1994
01:28:19.196 --> 01:28:20.098
You've been doing it
this whole time.


1995
01:28:20.165 --> 01:28:21.934
It's one at a time thing.

1996
01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:32.724
So where's your dad?

1997
01:28:32.789 --> 01:28:35.362
- He's making craft beer?
- No way.


1998
01:28:35.428 --> 01:28:37.332
He's always doing
weird stuff like that.


1999
01:28:37.399 --> 01:28:39.770
That... whatever makes him happy,
I guess.


2000
01:28:39.837 --> 01:28:42.042
- Feel weird.
- Oh, God.


2001
01:28:42.109 --> 01:28:45.915
- Week?
- A month, a year, life.


2002
01:28:47.219 --> 01:28:48.788
I'm also really... I'm sorry
that I didn't know what


2003
01:28:48.855 --> 01:28:51.227
was going on with you and Kevin.
I mean, I guess nobody did.


2004
01:28:51.294 --> 01:28:52.896
- I wish you knew.
- I didn't tell anyone.


2005
01:28:52.963 --> 01:28:54.300
It's just so embarrassing,

2006
01:28:54.366 --> 01:28:56.570
and he's so embarrassing,
honestly.


2007
01:28:56.638 --> 01:28:58.107
He is.

2008
01:28:58.174 --> 01:28:59.877
Were you embarrassed
when I first brought him around?


2009
01:28:59.943 --> 01:29:01.280
No.

2010
01:29:01.347 --> 01:29:03.051
I'm never gonna get him
out of that garage.


2011
01:29:03.117 --> 01:29:04.586
He will not go.

2012
01:29:04.654 --> 01:29:08.027
There's creative ways
to get them out of there too.


2013
01:29:08.094 --> 01:29:09.330
Yeah.

2014
01:29:09.396 --> 01:29:12.936
Like loud sex with someone
in the house.


2015
01:29:13.004 --> 01:29:15.609
- That's a good idea.
- Oh, my God.


2016
01:29:15.676 --> 01:29:19.216
Well, why don't I give you
a tour of the farm?


2017
01:29:19.283 --> 01:29:21.954
- Let's do it.
- Cool.


2018
01:29:22.022 --> 01:29:24.761
- How's Max?
- He does drugs.


2019
01:29:24.828 --> 01:29:28.968
I learned. Just weed, though.

2020
01:29:29.036 --> 01:29:30.972
We did a lot worse than that.

2021
01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.810
Shh, shh-shh-shh-shh.

2022
01:29:32.876 --> 01:29:34.279
We don't talk about that.

2023
01:29:35.949 --> 01:29:37.953
Katie would love
this place, man.


2024
01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:43.531
What are those assholes doing?

2025
01:29:43.599 --> 01:29:45.435
Oh, they thought Gigi
was serious about there


2026
01:29:45.502 --> 01:29:47.506
being something valuable
on the farm.


2027
01:29:49.143 --> 01:29:53.351
What if she was?

2028
01:29:53.418 --> 01:29:55.188
We've done this area,
it's finished.


2029
01:29:55.255 --> 01:29:56.357
I don't know what I've done.

2030
01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:57.959
Because you won't stop talking
to me.


2031
01:29:58.026 --> 01:29:59.963
Just share it, man.

2032
01:30:00.030 --> 01:30:05.074
Share it, share it, share it.
I will shock you with this.


2033
01:30:05.141 --> 01:30:06.042
It's... you can't shock
me with this!


2034
01:30:06.110 --> 01:30:07.212
Yes, you can.

2035
01:30:07.279 --> 01:30:08.649
- It shocks at the bott...
- Hey.


2036
01:30:08.715 --> 01:30:09.884
It shocks at the bottom.

2037
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:13.592
They say you can choose
your friends, not your family,


2038
01:30:13.659 --> 01:30:17.466
but you can choose
to be friends with your family.


2039
01:30:17.532 --> 01:30:19.001
- It's going well.
- Let's go to a different area.


2040
01:30:19.069 --> 01:30:20.505
- We've done a lot.
- I can tell.


2041
01:30:20.572 --> 01:30:21.942
- All right.
- We're gonna start back.


2042
01:30:22.007 --> 01:30:23.478
I want to... stop.

2043
01:30:23.544 --> 01:30:26.150
It's time to look
to the future.


2044
01:30:26.217 --> 01:30:29.223
Well, not for me, but-but you.

2045
01:30:29.289 --> 01:30:30.926
And after a year like this one,

2046
01:30:30.992 --> 01:30:35.903
the future sounds
like a pretty good idea.


2047
01:30:35.970 --> 01:30:38.140
Whoa-ho-ho!

2048
01:30:38.207 --> 01:30:40.980
Oh! Whoa! Whoa.

2049
01:30:41.045 --> 01:30:44.319
- Jump on it.
- Whoa.


2050
01:30:44.386 --> 01:30:46.223
- All the way. All the way.
- Ooh!


2051
01:30:46.290 --> 01:30:48.394
And the cries of the street

2052
01:30:48.461 --> 01:30:50.431
into us

2053
01:30:51.902 --> 01:30:54.273
Our love will still be there

2054
01:30:55.976 --> 01:30:59.048
Our love will still be there

2055
01:30:59.116 --> 01:31:04.192
When the rain from the sky
don't fall and the stars...


2056
01:31:04.259 --> 01:31:06.130
- And here we go.
- We're gonna clap.


2057
01:31:06.196 --> 01:31:07.767
Okay, great.

2058
01:31:07.833 --> 01:31:10.238
What? The rooster?

2059
01:31:10.305 --> 01:31:14.179
All right, and Ann,
give me a clap.


2060
01:31:14.246 --> 01:31:15.548
Clap city.

2061
01:31:15.616 --> 01:31:19.256
- All right, Judy.
- Yup, good. Thank you.


2062
01:31:19.323 --> 01:31:22.663
Mac, give me a good clap
in front of your face.


2063
01:31:22.730 --> 01:31:24.433
And Scott.

2064
01:31:24.499 --> 01:31:28.174
Okay, great.
Thank you. There we go. Okay.


2065
01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:31.313
Margo. All right, great.

2066
01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:33.484
- Okay, I'm still rolling.
- Should I go ahead and cut?


2067
01:31:33.551 --> 01:31:37.124
There we go. Good. Thank you.

2068
01:31:37.192 --> 01:31:38.361
Timothy.

2069
01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:46.176
Casey. Thank you.

2070
01:31:46.243 --> 01:31:49.316
Henry? Henry?

2071
01:31:49.383 --> 01:31:50.719
How often did you change
your clothes


2072
01:31:50.786 --> 01:31:52.355
during the lockdown?

2073
01:31:52.422 --> 01:31:55.495
Welcome to this crazy thing
we're about to do.


2074
01:31:55.561 --> 01:31:57.700
- Hey, Billy.
- Howdy.


2075
01:31:57.767 --> 01:31:59.002
Nice to meet you.

2076
01:31:59.069 --> 01:32:00.304
Back at ya.

2077
01:32:00.371 --> 01:32:02.175
Once I get a set from Luke,

2078
01:32:02.242 --> 01:32:03.477
'cause he'll confirm

2079
01:32:03.544 --> 01:32:05.381
that all the cameras
are actually rolling,


2080
01:32:05.448 --> 01:32:06.918
and then I'll tell Stephanie
we're ready,


2081
01:32:06.985 --> 01:32:08.387
and she'll call action.

2082
01:32:08.454 --> 01:32:10.893
So everyone's got their slate.
They've all put it up.


2083
01:32:10.959 --> 01:32:12.128
Well, I haven't.

2084
01:32:12.195 --> 01:32:13.699
- That's all right.
- That's all right.


2085
01:32:13.765 --> 01:32:15.334
- It's okay.
- Margo, it's fine.


2086
01:32:15.401 --> 01:32:18.507
- Is that a three, Billy?
- Yeah.


2087
01:32:18.574 --> 01:32:20.111
Do I have to push anything

2088
01:32:20.178 --> 01:32:23.250
on the microphone
or just turn it off?


2089
01:32:23.317 --> 01:32:26.390
Well, let me ask you,
are both of my cameras rolling?


2090
01:32:26.457 --> 01:32:28.127
Do I want to record
the Zoom too?


2091
01:32:28.195 --> 01:32:29.931
No.

2092
01:32:29.997 --> 01:32:32.870
And Susie's gonna give, like,
a handheld POV shot.


2093
01:32:32.937 --> 01:32:34.207
Gonna DP you.

2094
01:32:34.272 --> 01:32:35.943
When you're ready and action.

2095
01:32:36.009 --> 01:32:40.251
Should we try to do this one
much closer to book?


2096
01:32:40.318 --> 01:32:41.855
- Yeah, I think you should.
- Yeah.


2097
01:32:41.921 --> 01:32:44.159
Is it really... I just need
to catch that beat for them.


2098
01:32:44.227 --> 01:32:45.729
If you... just catch the beat,

2099
01:32:45.796 --> 01:32:49.637
and then you can use all
of that wonderful stuff.


2100
01:32:49.704 --> 01:32:51.608
So if we... if we miss
the beat...


2101
01:32:51.674 --> 01:32:54.146
I will call a reset, and we'll
go back and get the beat.


2102
01:32:54.212 --> 01:32:55.249
Give me the beat.

2103
01:32:55.314 --> 01:32:56.751
They should turn
the beat around.


2104
01:32:56.818 --> 01:33:00.491
Nope, no point in discussing
anything technical with me.


2105
01:33:00.558 --> 01:33:03.030
Well, you mean I was not
the only technical dummy?


2106
01:33:03.097 --> 01:33:04.466
Can't possibly be my fault.

2107
01:33:04.533 --> 01:33:06.938
- Lot of issues there today.
- Lot of issues.


2108
01:33:07.005 --> 01:33:08.440
- Hey, don't worry.
- We're gonna fix it in post.


2109
01:33:08.507 --> 01:33:10.712
If you go lower, not so good.

2110
01:33:10.779 --> 01:33:13.317
Oh, that's 'cause you're not
wearing pants, Margo.


2111
01:33:13.384 --> 01:33:15.054
I'm kind of blown away
by the fact


2112
01:33:15.121 --> 01:33:16.791
there may be life on Venus.

2113
01:33:16.858 --> 01:33:18.360
Didn't the government,
like, reveal


2114
01:33:18.427 --> 01:33:20.699
that they have,
like, UFO's are confirmed.


2115
01:33:20.766 --> 01:33:21.567
Yeah.

2116
01:33:21.634 --> 01:33:22.535
And then we're just like,

2117
01:33:22.603 --> 01:33:23.939
"Eh, well, it's Tuesday."

2118
01:33:24.005 --> 01:33:27.111
- Even a touch more.
- Just a nudge, Scott.


2119
01:33:27.178 --> 01:33:30.619
- That's it. The light color.
- Yeah. Perfect.


2120
01:33:30.686 --> 01:33:33.123
Yeah, can you do me
a bit favor, y'all?


2121
01:33:33.190 --> 01:33:37.565
Can we shoot my side a bit
so that I can get Rick


2122
01:33:37.633 --> 01:33:40.104
to help me move the barbecue?

2123
01:33:40.171 --> 01:33:41.274
Margo?

2124
01:33:41.341 --> 01:33:43.845
- Yeah.
- I don't see you.


2125
01:33:43.912 --> 01:33:46.651
But you know, the-the camera...
are you trying...


2126
01:33:46.718 --> 01:33:48.053
are you talking
about the camera?


2127
01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:50.491
I'm trying to turn
this-this off.


2128
01:33:50.558 --> 01:33:53.298
- I like the "Do me a favor.
- Don't yell at me."


2129
01:33:53.365 --> 01:33:55.268
It's really good.

2130
01:33:55.335 --> 01:33:56.838
Let's take Judy, Henry,

2131
01:33:56.905 --> 01:33:58.507
and Margo
to a breakout room, please.


2132
01:33:58.574 --> 01:34:00.011
Bye.

2133
01:34:00.077 --> 01:34:01.314
And then just to say, sorry,
you weren't with her.


2134
01:34:01.381 --> 01:34:06.056
And then... and you could just say
she didn't want me there.


2135
01:34:06.123 --> 01:34:07.492
I'm sorry you couldn't be
with her.


2136
01:34:07.558 --> 01:34:09.129
Yeah.

2137
01:34:09.195 --> 01:34:10.299
She didn't want me there.

2138
01:34:10.365 --> 01:34:11.734
It might just be power strips,

2139
01:34:11.801 --> 01:34:14.039
but if I had one,
it would be there, right?


2140
01:34:14.105 --> 01:34:15.508
- Okay, I'll check it out.
- Okay.


2141
01:34:15.574 --> 01:34:17.613
Maybe don't wet your hair,
Casey.


2142
01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:20.686
- You got it.
- Let's reset from the top.


2143
01:34:20.752 --> 01:34:22.389
Just there's, like,
a loud rooster


2144
01:34:22.455 --> 01:34:23.591
that Katie has been dealing with

2145
01:34:23.658 --> 01:34:25.227
the whole fucking time
at the farm.


2146
01:34:25.294 --> 01:34:27.031
You know you're at the farm
if you like... if you're like,


2147
01:34:27.098 --> 01:34:28.702
"I'm gonna kill
that fucking rooster,"


2148
01:34:28.768 --> 01:34:31.206
or "I'm gonna shoot
that rooster," would be better.


2149
01:34:31.273 --> 01:34:32.475
Yeah, give me.

2150
01:34:32.542 --> 01:34:34.145
Yo, that's the name
of the movie.


2151
01:34:34.212 --> 01:34:36.451
Yo, that's the name
of the movie.


2152
01:34:36.516 --> 01:34:38.253
Billy, you gotta say that.

2153
01:34:38.321 --> 01:34:40.257
- Oh, my God.
- I'm gonna shoot that rooster.


2154
01:34:40.325 --> 01:34:41.694
Okay, let's cut.

2155
01:34:41.761 --> 01:34:43.564
Go ahead and stop our cameras

2156
01:34:43.631 --> 01:34:45.602
from recording
and our microphone, please.


2157
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:47.037
Thank you.

2158
01:34:47.104 --> 01:34:48.907
- Bye, bye.
- See you all tomorrow.


2159
01:34:48.974 --> 01:34:50.577
- Thank you, June.
- Bye, June.


2160
01:34:50.644 --> 01:34:52.114
See you tomorrow.

2161
01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:55.253
Our love will still be there

2162
01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:58.637
