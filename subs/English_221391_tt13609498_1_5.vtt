- Yeah?
- You must be Mr. Car-moan.


173
00:14:30.796 --> 00:14:32.536
Karmon.

174
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.840
Hazan is fine.

175
00:14:33.886 --> 00:14:36.576
Hazan it is.
Sawyer Clarkman.


176
00:14:39.239 --> 00:14:40.369
How can I help you?

177

[groans]

178
00:14:43.461 --> 00:14:46.771
These, uh, pre-revolution?

179
00:14:46.812 --> 00:14:49.032
Hm, is that what brought you
out here?


180
00:14:51.512 --> 00:14:53.862
One day, I was a boy running
around in Iran


181
00:14:53.906 --> 00:14:57.606
'amongst my dozen
aunts and uncles..'


182
00:14:57.649 --> 00:14:59.349
...and the next day..

183
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.740
...I'm here in this country..

184
00:15:01.783 --> 00:15:04.053
...alone.

185
00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.350
- Tough time to be Iranian.
- Hm.


186
00:15:06.397 --> 00:15:08.307
Having a little Deja Vuagain
these days.


187
00:15:08.355 --> 00:15:09.615
Hm.

188
00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:14.061
I'm here about your son.

189
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.840
Came to see me yesterday.

190
00:15:16.885 --> 00:15:18.665
His mother used to work for me.

191
00:15:18.713 --> 00:15:21.063
Dalla Uribe?

192
00:15:21.107 --> 00:15:23.407
And he wanted to know
more about her


193
00:15:23.457 --> 00:15:27.897
and his, uh...biological father.

194
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.030
Hm.

195
00:15:30.116 --> 00:15:31.596
I see.

196
00:15:32.945 --> 00:15:34.285
And I do know some things.

197
00:15:34.338 --> 00:15:36.818
- About his father...
- He was a bad man.


198
00:15:36.862 --> 00:15:38.392
That is true.

199
00:15:39.952 --> 00:15:42.432
Paula made sure I knew.

200
00:15:42.476 --> 00:15:45.696
She never wanted the kid
to meet this biological father.


201
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.480
Well, there's little chance of
César showing up now.


202
00:15:48.526 --> 00:15:50.696
She meant you.

203
00:15:50.745 --> 00:15:53.615
[dramatic music]

204
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:57.061
[sighs]
I'm not going to show you shit
without his permission.


205
00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.280
Why is it important to you?
I mean, why now?


206
00:15:59.319 --> 00:16:00.969
My father has
been distracted lately


207
00:16:01.017 --> 00:16:02.977
and I need to make sure
that he's thinking clearly.


208
00:16:04.542 --> 00:16:06.022
This about the Holloway deal?

209
00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:07.845
You tell me, Diana.

210
00:16:07.893 --> 00:16:10.373
The Sawyer Clarkman you've
worked for all these years


211
00:16:10.417 --> 00:16:12.117
'he seem like a kind of man
that would pass up'


212
00:16:12.158 --> 00:16:14.028
'an expansion opportunity
like this'


213
00:16:14.073 --> 00:16:17.123
and let a cocksucker like Miller
railroad his plans?


214
00:16:20.862 --> 00:16:23.302
You're a woman, I'm sure you
know what it feels.


215
00:16:23.343 --> 00:16:25.083
What?

216
00:16:25.128 --> 00:16:28.698
Like you may've gotten passed up
'cause you had a pair of tits.


217
00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.740
That's why I started
my own firm, dear.


218
00:16:32.178 --> 00:16:33.568
I'm not here
to invoke the 25th.


219
00:16:33.614 --> 00:16:35.624
I just need to know
if he trusts me.


220
00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.660
Really trusts me, before I do
what I need to do


221
00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:40.876
in order to protect
what he's built.


222
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.320
I'm sorry, Hunter.

223
00:16:44.364 --> 00:16:48.244
You're wasting your time.
Seriously, go home.

[keyboard keys clacking]

[Hazan]
Are you surprised?


226
00:16:56.159 --> 00:16:57.639
Needed confirmation.

227
00:16:59.075 --> 00:17:00.155
[chuckling]

228
00:17:00.206 --> 00:17:01.816
You promised her the world

229
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.120
'and you get pregnant
and then you ship her off?'


230
00:17:05.167 --> 00:17:06.687
It didn't happen like that.

231
00:17:06.734 --> 00:17:08.654
Oh, yeah. Like, I'm going to
trust what you say.


232
00:17:10.347 --> 00:17:12.827
I didn't even know
she was pregnant.


233
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:14.090
[sighs]

234
00:17:14.133 --> 00:17:16.483
What do you want? Hm?

235
00:17:16.527 --> 00:17:19.137
Noah's never gonna talk to you
again. Go home to your family.


236
00:17:19.182 --> 00:17:21.402
Everybody deserves to know
where they came from.


237
00:17:21.445 --> 00:17:23.875
You're going to tell him that
you just threw his mother away?


238
00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:26.410
Don't rephrase it like that.

239
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:27.580
Hm.

240
00:17:27.625 --> 00:17:29.445
What's that going to do for you?
Hm?

- What did you do?
- Nothing.

Do you want me to go call
an ambulance?


253
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.650
Call Sheila.
Stay with me.

I am.

It's funny, 'cause Hassie had
Algebra with your Lucy

and I clearly remember her
saying what a dumb shit she was.

Diana, you already know
where I'm going with this.


263
00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:35.740
Come on, I did a little digging.

264
00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.740
And this is the only proof.

on this drive'

No need to get emotional.

Diana, I can keep a secret.
You know that.


271
00:18:56.104 --> 00:18:57.764
I just need the password.

I gotta say, Miller,
that was damn good.


277
00:20:08.438 --> 00:20:10.828
- My compliments to the chef.
- You like it?


278
00:20:10.875 --> 00:20:14.175
That kale sweet potato hash was
just to die for.


279
00:20:14.226 --> 00:20:16.706
That Bombay burrito..
What'd you put in there?


280
00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.400
Just fresh, local

281
00:20:18.448 --> 00:20:21.758
none of that crap you get
in restaurants like soy.


282
00:20:22.756 --> 00:20:24.186
Soy's bad?

283
00:20:24.236 --> 00:20:26.976
Makes men grow breast
and women infertile.

You make this kinda stuff
for Clarkman?

He never really want
to try anything new.


287

- Another round?
- Yeah.

00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:36.729
Perfect.

289
00:20:38.337 --> 00:20:39.727
I'll be back.

290
00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:43.781
Where'd you get her?

291
00:20:43.821 --> 00:20:45.301
Kinda fell into my lap.

292
00:20:45.344 --> 00:20:47.564
She's interesting.
Lot of spirit.

with Holloway

me and Holloway.

awards with wine,
I wanna make money, eh?

Why do people want awards?
Thank you.

with awards? No.

too far from them, you know?

327
00:22:42.069 --> 00:22:43.589
So, there is something.

328
00:22:46.204 --> 00:22:49.904
You have lied to me my whole

Doctor-patient and all that.


332

Sh-should we call his wife?

333
00:23:10.054 --> 00:23:12.714
He insisted we not do that.

334
00:23:14.711 --> 00:23:17.541

335

Hey.

339

You're pretty scrappy
for a little guy.


340
00:23:41.172 --> 00:23:44.352
Is that your way of
getting on my good side?

Hm.

350
00:24:14.814 --> 00:24:18.044
She was gearing up to cross back
over the border.

We were talking regularly.

352

'that she was on her way'

He doesn't need
another old man.

all my kids plenty.

with estate law?

Look, I appreciate
the conversation

but we're going to have to
establish some boundaries.

Luke Clarkman has a widow..

...and that she might be happy
to sell off whatever property

So, uh, you're my father?

on the other side of that door.

she's the eldest, she's adopted.

I can't say I did a great job,
she's a piece of work.

than the previous guy.

thing that ever happened to me.

with my kids

the right thing at the time.

about you until now.

take away from this is that..
