00:00:23.994 --> 00:00:26.661
(gentle music)

4
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.593
- Good day, Sir,

5
00:00:56.593 --> 00:00:59.280
I was wondering if you might
have a certain book in stock.


6
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.310
- Sure, what are you looking for?

7
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.470
- One of the "For Dummies" books.

8
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.080
- Yes, I got many of them.

9
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.913
Which one?

10
00:01:05.913 --> 00:01:07.247
- "Acting For Dummies."

11
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.100
- Well, I don't
think I have that one.

12
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.430
- Okay, I'll tell you what,
I'll be back a little bit later.


13
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.080
And if you can get for
me, I'd appreciate it.


14
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.570
- Oh, of course, of course.

15
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.492
- Thank you very much.

16
00:01:17.492 --> 00:01:18.325
- Not a problem.

17
00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:19.580
You have a wonderful.

18
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.413
- You too.

19
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.013
(gentle music)

20
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.227
- Can I help you find something?

21
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.200
- How long have
you guys have been here?

22
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.263
- Quite some time.

23
00:01:36.282 --> 00:01:39.198
- I don't remember this being here.

24
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.280
I could have sworn this was
a closed old shoe store,


25
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.130
about a week ago.

26
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.963
(store clerk laughing)

27
00:01:44.963 --> 00:01:46.520
- Shoe store.

28
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.990
Surely you must be mistaken.

29
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.450
We've been here for years.

30
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.020
Why, look at all the
dust in this old shop.


31
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.910
- So what kind of stuff
do you have in here?


32
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.109
- Books and the antique odd and end.

33
00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:01.480
- You sure do you have
a collection of things.


34
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.313
- Thank you.

35
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.260
- Probably nothing that
would fit my collection.


36
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.440
- Oh, really?

37
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.079
What sort of collection do you have?

38
00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:12.480
- Oh, it isn't a large collection,

39
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.210
but just a few first
editions, some signed copies,


40
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.300
oh, and mint condition of course.

41
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.763
- [Store Clerk] Of course, sir.

42
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.793
- Again, you probably have
nothing that would fit.


43
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.790
- Well, I may
have one or two things.

44
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.580
- [Man] Oh yeah, what you got?

45
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.860
- In fact, I recently
obtained a fine first edition,


46
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.170
Mary Shelley, "The Modern Prometheus."

47
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.703
Signed by the author in 1818.

48
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.003
- Yeah.

49
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.750
Yeah, that's what I thought.

50
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.950
It's in rough condition.

51
00:02:50.013 --> 00:02:51.484
Yeah, that's not for me.

52
00:02:51.484 --> 00:02:53.333
- It's a bit worn, I suppose.

53
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.360
Here I have an, "Athanasius
Kircher Magnetica Opus."


54
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.150
From 1654 in excellent condition, Sir.

55
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.943
This could fetch a great
price in the right market.


56
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.630
- I've seen books like this

57
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.910
fetch good money and shows in Chicago.

58
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.760
- [Store Clerk] You already have one?

59
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.010
- Not any longer.

60
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.160
But, nah, it's not really
a what I'm looking for.


61
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.530
- So the first one, the
condition isn't right.


62
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.873
And the "Kircher" you already have one.

63
00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:30.843
Or you're used to.

64
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.753
I may just have the book
that you can't pass up.


65
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.723
This is one of the rarest
books in the world, Sir.


66
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.420
The only one of it's kind.

67
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.929
- Really, I doubt that.

68
00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:48.440
- Yes.

69
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.840
Be careful with that.

70
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.640
- I know how
to handle books like this.

71
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.640
- Of course, Sir.

72
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.023
It's completely unique.

73
00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.283
- How much?

74
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.760
- Well, like I said, it's extremely rare.

75
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.900
But for a collector like yourself,

76
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.043
I could come down a bit
on the price, $5,000.


77
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.300
- 5,000.

78
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.133
- Yes.

79
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.080
If you can't afford it,

80
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.160
it's completely understandable. Sir.

81
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.080
- Well for 5,000 it better be unique.

82
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.450
- The only one of it's
kind in the world, Sir,


83
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.523
it has a fascinating backstory.

84
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.300
- So if you're asking price is 5,000,

85
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.660
what was your original price?

86
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.653
- 10,000.

87
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.786
- Why is such a discount,
what's wrong with it?


88
00:04:36.786 --> 00:04:39.370
- It keeps coming back to me.

89
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.750
- Returned?

90
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.370
So you're trying to sell me buck.

91
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.340
- No, no, not
returns, not at all, Sir.

92
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.040
I just keep finding it

93
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.730
in old estate sales that I obtain.

94
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.420
Or perhaps the owner is
looking to make some fast cash.


95
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.873
It's very valuable.

96
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.510
- Okay, I'll take it.

97
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.950
- [Store Clerk] Excellent.

98
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.430
- But if I find out it's junk,

99
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.400
I'm bringing it back and
getting my money back.


100
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.893
- Very good, excellent, Sir.

101
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.130
But I do want to in good
conscience to tell you,


102
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.230
this book has a history.

103
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.800
- Oh no, we've already
agreed on a price of 5,000.


104
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.320
You're not gonna raise the price on me.

105
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.380
- Oh no, not that, sir.

106
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.363
It's just, don't read it.

107
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.800
When you take it home,

108
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.780
just put it up on the
shelf and leave it there,


109
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.780
don't open it, Sir.

110
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.613
- [Man] Really?

111
00:05:33.613 --> 00:05:34.446
And why is that?

112
00:05:34.446 --> 00:05:38.680
- Well, it's said that
this book is cursed.


113
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.230
I don't put much stock
in those things myself


114
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.113
but you never know.

115
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.793
- Well,

116
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.523
I can do with it
as a one now, it's mine.

117
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.093
- No, don't read it.

118
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.263
Thank you, come again.

119
00:06:00.155 --> 00:06:03.155
(suspenseful music)

120
00:06:54.668 --> 00:06:57.751
(car engine revving)

121
00:07:52.291 --> 00:07:54.958
(gentle music)

122
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.493
- Cursed.

123
00:08:13.938 --> 00:08:17.188
(gentle upbeat music)

124
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.160
- [Man] That was "Raggedy Man In Blue"

125
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.310
by The Travelers on Atlantic Records,

126
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.009
a new band to keep an eye
on as they climb the charts.


127
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.880
Local news time, 9:40.

128
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.680
Reports of vicious animal attacks

129
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.562
have spread closer to town.

130
00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.960
- We don't need that mess right now.

131
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.580
- What if it was something important?

132
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.300
- It's the same stuff had
been listening to all week.


133
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.183
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

134
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.870
- You couldn't protect
yourself from crazed midget,


135
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.413
let alone some wild animal.

136
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.570
Whatever.

137
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.553
Look, I'm a tough customer.

138
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.000
I can handle anything
that's thrown my way.


139
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.833
- Oh yeah.

140
00:09:06.833 --> 00:09:08.110
- Yeah.

141
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.680
- You can take anyone, huh?

142
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.070
- Anyone.

143
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.320
- Why don't you take me
right now, tough guy.


144
00:09:14.666 --> 00:09:17.416
(both laughing)

145
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:19.760
What was that?

146
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.331
- It's probably just some.

147
00:09:23.331 --> 00:09:24.329
- Just a what?

148
00:09:24.329 --> 00:09:26.682
- It's probably just
someone messing with us.


149
00:09:26.682 --> 00:09:28.140
(animal growling)

150
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.723
Hey, leave us alone.

151
00:09:30.582 --> 00:09:33.350
(animal growling)

152
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.450
You better leave or you're gonna be sorry.

153
00:09:38.595 --> 00:09:40.340
- Oh, come on, don't.

154
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.900
- Look it's probably just
someone messing with us.


155
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.590
I'm gonna put it
into to it right now.

156
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:46.773
- Just stay in the car.

157
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.560
Let's go back to town.

158
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.160
We don't need to mess with this.

159
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.043
Let's just go.

160
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:55.753
- Look, I'll be right back.

161
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.170
- Come on, get back in the car.

162
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.253
All right, come out cowards.

163
00:10:09.155 --> 00:10:12.238
(suspenseful music)

164
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.580
- Stop.

165
00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.000
Let's just go.

166
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
(suspenseful music)

167
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.023
Hello.

168
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.633
Honey.

169
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.783
Come back to the car.

170
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.083
Come on.

171
00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.293
This isn't funny.

172
00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.190
I just wanna go home.

173
00:10:50.112 --> 00:10:53.195
(suspenseful music)

174
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.763
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

175
00:11:21.622 --> 00:11:24.455
(animal growling)

176
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.183
Excuse me, I'll be going
back to the car now.


177
00:11:33.979 --> 00:11:36.812
(birds chirping)

178
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.930
- [Boy] See, I told you
I'd bring you dinner.


179
00:11:45.055 --> 00:11:45.888
(animal growling)

180
00:11:45.888 --> 00:11:48.638
(girl screaming)

181
00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.933
- That dirty lying.

182
00:12:09.652 --> 00:12:12.735
(suspenseful music)

183
00:12:18.125 --> 00:12:19.250
- Quit playing with that.

184
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.526
I'm gonna tell mom.

185
00:12:21.526 --> 00:12:22.988
- Come on.

186
00:12:22.988 --> 00:12:24.438
You wanna see something cool?

187
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.280
- Mom said to go straight home.

188
00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.640
- It'll just take a few minutes.

189
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.473
I know a way in.

190
00:12:32.517 --> 00:12:33.350
- Mom said.

191
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:34.890
- Mom said, mom said.

192
00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:36.040
Don't be a baby.

193
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.376
- I'm not a baby.

194
00:12:37.376 --> 00:12:38.900
- What was that?

195
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:39.733
- What was what?

196
00:12:39.733 --> 00:12:41.093
- I think I heard something.

197
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.620
- The building's completely empty.

198
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.413
I've been in there a million times.

199
00:12:47.736 --> 00:12:50.321
- I don't think
we should go in there.

200
00:12:50.321 --> 00:12:52.280
- I thought you
said you weren't a baby.

201
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.113
Come on.

202
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:54.813
- Fine.

203
00:12:54.813 --> 00:12:56.277
Hey, wait for me.

204
00:13:00.123 --> 00:13:02.706
(man laughing)

205
00:13:13.752 --> 00:13:16.419
(man coughing)

206
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.800
- Just give us a name,

207
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.833
a location, anything.

208
00:13:27.768 --> 00:13:29.100
And this can all be over.

209
00:13:33.553 --> 00:13:36.636
(suspenseful music)

210
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.670
- They say no one knows his identity,

211
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.613
that he works in the shadows.

212
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.940
But we know that you
contracted the hitman,


213
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.663
called The Sorcerer, to kill my family.

214
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.283
Did you not have the
courage to do it yourself?


215
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.613
(man laughing)

216
00:14:07.424 --> 00:14:10.091
(man screaming)

217
00:14:14.373 --> 00:14:16.956
(man laughing)

218
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.770
My wife, my daughters.

219
00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.033
You tell me where to find him.

220
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.803
- We know, you know.

221
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.833
Just give us something and this ends.

222
00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:56.903
- Tell me, is it true what
they say about The Sorcerer,


223
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:59.923
that he has superhuman powers,

224
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.333
that anything he touches dies,

225
00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.891
that the touch of his
own finger is so deadly,


226
00:15:09.891 --> 00:15:11.610
that even if he scratched his own itch,

227
00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:12.723
he would kill himself?

228
00:15:21.654 --> 00:15:24.321
(man screaming)

229
00:15:36.031 --> 00:15:38.614
(man laughing)

230
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.550
You think this is a joke?

231
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.420
He murdered my wife,

232
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.070
my children.

233
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.653
(man laughing)

234
00:15:58.482 --> 00:16:01.755
(man screaming)

235
00:16:01.755 --> 00:16:04.755
(suspenseful music)

236
00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.073
(man laughing)

237
00:16:16.948 --> 00:16:17.781
His hand.

238
00:16:19.322 --> 00:16:21.905
(man laughing)

239
00:16:23.062 --> 00:16:26.145
(suspenseful music)

240
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:36.463
This is your last chance.

241
00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.480
Tell us where to find The Sorcerer

242
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.130
or are we start with your fingers.

243
00:16:43.157 --> 00:16:46.157
(suspenseful music)

244
00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:48.723
No?

245
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.665
Do it.

246
00:16:51.665 --> 00:16:54.748
(saw blade spinning)

247
00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.407
(man screaming)

248
00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:09.823
You were saying?

249
00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:16.850
- I swear, I didn't hire The Sorcerer.

250
00:17:23.679 --> 00:17:25.833
I am The Sorcerer.

251
00:17:26.776 --> 00:17:29.777
(suspenseful music)

252
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:32.913
High five.

253
00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.313
High four.

254
00:17:41.605 --> 00:17:44.017
(gun firing)

255
00:17:44.017 --> 00:17:46.600
(man laughing)

256
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.003
- No, don't, please.

257
00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.480
I'll give you anything you want.

258
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.083
- I can't allow any witnesses.

259
00:18:14.811 --> 00:18:16.076
(girls screaming)

260
00:18:16.076 --> 00:18:16.909
- Run.

261
00:18:18.661 --> 00:18:21.661
(suspenseful music)

262
00:18:40.974 --> 00:18:42.623
- Help me.

263
00:18:42.623 --> 00:18:45.706
(suspenseful music)

264
00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.330
- Give me your hand.

265
00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:59.721
- No.

266
00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:02.471
(girl screaming)

267
00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:08.367
- Get up, you have
to get up, he's coming.

268
00:19:09.664 --> 00:19:10.938
Come on.

269
00:19:10.938 --> 00:19:14.282
You have to get up, we
have to get outta here.


270
00:19:14.282 --> 00:19:16.532
Hurry up, he's almost here.

271
00:19:17.417 --> 00:19:18.917
- Leave 'em alone.

272
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:23.923
- No.

273
00:19:32.407 --> 00:19:35.657
(gentle upbeat music)

274
00:19:41.916 --> 00:19:44.578
- Wait, what if somebody touches him?

275
00:19:44.578 --> 00:19:47.661
(saw blade spinning)

276
00:19:54.572 --> 00:19:57.572
(suspenseful music)

277
00:20:18.925 --> 00:20:21.675
(fire crackling)

278
00:20:24.263 --> 00:20:25.983
- Are you telling mom?

279
00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:36.858
(gentle music)

280
00:21:52.793 --> 00:21:55.960
(clock alarm ringing)

281
00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.090
- Carrie, time to get up.

282
00:22:01.427 --> 00:22:04.594
(clock alarm ringing)

283
00:22:10.275 --> 00:22:11.170
Hey, that's all you're gonna eat?

284
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.873
- Well yeah, go on, 
I gotta get my run in.

285
00:22:13.873 --> 00:22:17.090
- It's our vacation, we
gotta relax and have fun.


286
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:18.635
- I am having fun.

287
00:22:18.635 --> 00:22:20.215
And besides, if I don't workout,

288
00:22:20.215 --> 00:22:22.370
you might leave me for someone else.

289
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:23.483
- Better believe it.

290
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.532
Carrie, breakfast is ready.

291
00:22:28.532 --> 00:22:31.699
(alarm clock ringing)

292
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.306
Carrie, get up, honey.

293
00:22:36.306 --> 00:22:39.473
(alarm clock ringing)

294
00:22:42.571 --> 00:22:44.396
What is she doing?

295
00:22:44.396 --> 00:22:47.563
(alarm clock ringing)

296
00:22:57.471 --> 00:23:00.030
Carrie, get up.

297
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:01.430
Don't make me come in there.

298
00:23:02.857 --> 00:23:06.024
(alarm clock ringing)

299
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.785
Get up, we gotta get into town.

300
00:23:10.785 --> 00:23:12.456
(door knocking)

301
00:23:12.456 --> 00:23:13.321
Come on.

302
00:23:13.321 --> 00:23:16.488
(alarm clock ringing)

303
00:23:20.394 --> 00:23:22.170
Carrie, where are you hiding?

304
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:23.533
We need to go into town.

305
00:23:25.156 --> 00:23:25.989
Where are you?

306
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:28.403
It's not funny.

307
00:23:38.443 --> 00:23:42.064
(suspenseful music)

308
00:23:42.064 --> 00:23:42.897
Carrie.

309
00:23:46.568 --> 00:23:49.235
(gentle music)

310
00:24:54.437 --> 00:24:57.187
(birds chirping)

311
00:25:03.057 --> 00:25:05.724
(gentle music)

312
00:25:24.985 --> 00:25:27.618
(birds chirping)

313
00:25:27.618 --> 00:25:30.249
- Hey, stay near the house.

314
00:25:30.249 --> 00:25:32.999
(birds chirping)

315
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.553
Izzy.

316
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.673
Izzy, where did you go?

317
00:25:51.876 --> 00:25:54.709
(birds chirping)

318
00:26:08.126 --> 00:26:09.830
Where did you get this?

319
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:12.602
- Tulip left it for me,
when we were playing.


320
00:26:12.602 --> 00:26:13.769
- Who's Tulip?

321
00:26:15.375 --> 00:26:16.425
- Just a little girl.

322
00:26:17.842 --> 00:26:18.703
- Where is she?

323
00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:21.083
- In the woods.

324
00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.660
- [Monica] Why's a
little girl in the woods?


325
00:26:25.757 --> 00:26:27.057
- I guess she lives there.

326
00:26:28.007 --> 00:26:28.840
- Okay.

327
00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.813
Let's go inside okay, get unpacked.

328
00:26:36.366 --> 00:26:39.116
(birds chirping)

329
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.780
Hey, Izz, it's time
to get ready for bed.

330
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.140
- [Izzy] Mom, do I have to?

331
00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:52.323
- Yes you do.

332
00:26:53.301 --> 00:26:54.540
You wanna have some fun tomorrow,

333
00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.500
so you need to get some rest.

334
00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.910
- [Izzy] But I don't
wanna go to bed yet.

335
00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.330
- Go take your
shower, get your PJ's on.

336
00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:05.043
- Can I play on my tablet for
a little bit after my shower?


337
00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.010
- Just for an hour.

338
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:08.843
- Thanks, Mom.

339
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:45.450
- Hey, where did you get this?

340
00:28:07.699 --> 00:28:10.366
(girl laughing)

341
00:28:19.777 --> 00:28:22.777
(voices chattering)

342
00:28:54.825 --> 00:28:57.173
Morning sleepy head.

343
00:28:57.173 --> 00:28:58.418
- Morning.

344
00:28:58.418 --> 00:28:59.676
- Did you sleep okay?

345
00:28:59.676 --> 00:29:00.823
- I guess.

346
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:04.380
- Ready to go on some adventures today?

347
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:10.663
- I was wondering if we
could just stay here?


348
00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.910
- [Monica] Yeah.

349
00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:13.763
You feeling okay?

350
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:17.660
- Yeah, I just don't really
feel like going anywhere today.


351
00:29:19.308 --> 00:29:20.141
- Okay.

352
00:29:24.241 --> 00:29:27.074
(birds chirping)

353
00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:29.763
Hey, listen.

354
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:39.430
I know that things have been
really hard on you lately.


355
00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:44.870
You know that your dad leaving

356
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:46.570
has nothing to do with you, right?

357
00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:01.160
- Can I go sit outside

358
00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.043
by myself for a while?

359
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.126
- Can I make you some tea?

360
00:30:12.126 --> 00:30:13.667
- No, I'm okay.

361
00:30:23.067 --> 00:30:25.560
- Are you sure you don't
want to go exploring?


362
00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.660
- Yeah, I'm sure, Mom.

363
00:30:29.544 --> 00:30:31.980
- I thought you wanted to
have some fun this week.


364
00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.480
- I am having fun.

365
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:35.263
- Drawing.

366
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.360
Drawing is fun?

367
00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.643
- Yeah, I like it.

368
00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:48.100
- That's really good.

369
00:30:55.402 --> 00:31:00.402
Is that you and me?

370
00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.260
Who's that?

371
00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.093
- That's Tulip.

372
00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:04.993
- Who's Tulip?

373
00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.220
- She's my friend,

374
00:31:08.118 --> 00:31:10.460
the one that lives in the woods.

375
00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:11.293
- Oh yeah.

376
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.750
Is she nice?

377
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:20.130
- Yeah.

378
00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:22.743
Her friend Robin's kind of
mean to her sometimes though.


379
00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.560
- Is that kind of like that guy

380
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.010
that's mean to you at school?

381
00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:35.093
- I guess so.

382
00:31:40.577 --> 00:31:42.310
- Is that one Robin?

383
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:43.583
- No, that's Carrie.

384
00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:45.697
- Who's Carrie?

385
00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:50.263
- She's a girl that Tulip
brings to play sometimes.


386
00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.750
- Where's she from?

387
00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:59.643
- She said that she stayed here once,

388
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:01.817
like a long time ago.

389
00:32:10.325 --> 00:32:11.158
- Why don't we pick up

390
00:32:11.158 --> 00:32:13.883
and at least go walk some trails together.

391
00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:17.929
Please.

392
00:32:17.929 --> 00:32:18.762
- Okay.

393
00:32:22.019 --> 00:32:23.186
Oh I guess so.

394
00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.163
- Where did these rocks come from?

395
00:32:36.117 --> 00:32:38.590
Hey Izz, stay out near the house okay,

396
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:39.810
it's too late to be near the woods.

397
00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:43.544
- But Tulip wanted me
to show her my drawings.


398
00:32:43.544 --> 00:32:45.490
- [Monica] You heard me, come one.

399
00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:46.637
- Sorry, Tulip.

400
00:32:57.312 --> 00:32:58.380
- Izzy.

401
00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.403
- What, Mom?

402
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.765
I'm not in the woods.

403
00:33:01.765 --> 00:33:04.070
- Okay, just come inside, come on.

404
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.903
- Why, Mom?

405
00:33:04.903 --> 00:33:06.270
I was having fun.

406
00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:08.013
- I know baby, it's getting late.

407
00:33:14.536 --> 00:33:17.453
Izz, who was that man in the woods?

408
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.940
- What man, Mom?

409
00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.970
- That man that I saw the
red cap, who was that?


410
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.253
- I don't know, Mom, 
I didn't see him.

411
00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:30.273
- Okay, just if anyone comes,
you have to let me know, okay.


412
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.053
- Okay, Mom.

413
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.397
- Just go tidy up your
room, I'll make dinner.


414
00:34:02.653 --> 00:34:04.030
(suspenseful music)

415
00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:05.540
Izzy.

416
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:08.075
Izzy, I told you it's too late.

417
00:34:08.075 --> 00:34:09.075
- What, Mom?

418
00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:23.163
I just thought I saw something.

419
00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:29.823
- Do you want me
to help you with dinner?

420
00:34:29.823 --> 00:34:30.823
- Thank you.

421
00:34:41.707 --> 00:34:42.824
- Ow.

422
00:34:42.824 --> 00:34:44.491
- What's the matter?

423
00:34:46.279 --> 00:34:48.859
Where are you getting these?

424
00:34:48.859 --> 00:34:51.473
- It must've been Tulip,
she probably left it for me.


425
00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.000
- We don't put
rocks in our bed, okay.

426
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.113
- [Izzy] I didn't.

427
00:34:56.339 --> 00:34:58.200
- Then where does it come from?

428
00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.000
- I told you, it must've been Tulip.

429
00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.243
- No more rocks.

430
00:35:07.888 --> 00:35:10.888
(crickets chirping)

431
00:35:18.445 --> 00:35:22.056
- [Izzy] Tulip stop, no.

432
00:35:22.056 --> 00:35:22.889
- Izzy.

433
00:35:24.886 --> 00:35:27.863
- No, Tulip stop, 
I told you would flip.

434
00:35:27.863 --> 00:35:28.892
No,

435
00:35:28.892 --> 00:35:29.892
don't do it.

436
00:35:30.787 --> 00:35:31.839
Mom.

437
00:35:31.839 --> 00:35:32.922
- Izzy, Izzy.

438
00:35:34.362 --> 00:35:36.917
(suspenseful music)

439
00:35:36.917 --> 00:35:37.750
Izzy.

440
00:35:38.755 --> 00:35:39.588
Izzy.

441
00:35:40.905 --> 00:35:41.880
Izzy.

442
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.713
Izzy.

443
00:35:43.932 --> 00:35:44.765
Izzy.

444
00:35:46.642 --> 00:35:47.852
Izzy, where are you?

445
00:35:47.852 --> 00:35:48.685
Izzy.

446
00:35:53.261 --> 00:35:54.094
Izzy.

447
00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.443
Hey, have you seen my daughter?

448
00:36:10.445 --> 00:36:13.112
(gentle music)

449
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:46.780
- No.

450
00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:48.903
No, babe no, I'm serious, 
I can't tonight.

451
00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:55.663
I can't, I got to get
moving on this thesis.


452
00:36:58.488 --> 00:37:00.360
Yeah, I don't know, I don't know.

453
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.303
Maybe something like some
urban legends or something.


454
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.000
You know Dr. Gordon loves that shit.

455
00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:13.540
No, no, I was just started tonight.

456
00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:14.590
Yeah, I know, I know.

457
00:37:15.791 --> 00:37:17.000
No, no.

458
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.990
Look, I definitely can't tonight,

459
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.823
all right, I can't.

460
00:37:19.823 --> 00:37:20.990
But you know what?

461
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:22.990
How about you and I do
something this weekend,


462
00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:23.823
something nice?

463
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:26.837
Yeah.

464
00:37:26.837 --> 00:37:27.670
Yeah.

465
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:29.530
We'll go there okay.

466
00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:30.413
Yeah, but just tonight,

467
00:37:30.413 --> 00:37:32.920
I just gotta make sure I have something

468
00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.153
to run by him tomorrow.

469
00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:37.693
Yeah.

470
00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.103
Okay, I miss you too.

471
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:43.550
All right, all right.

472
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:45.790
Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

473
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:47.610
Okay, good night.

474
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:48.830
I love you too.

475
00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:49.663
Okay bye.

476
00:37:54.435 --> 00:37:57.018
(gentle music)

477
00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:22.183
- [Man] Showtime.

478
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:30.320
- I don't wanna be a bother

479
00:38:31.713 --> 00:38:35.713
but I was told there would
be a bottle of water.


480
00:38:39.307 --> 00:38:41.890
(gentle music)

481
00:39:00.377 --> 00:39:01.210
- Come on.

482
00:39:03.044 --> 00:39:05.377
There's no way this is live.

483
00:39:08.588 --> 00:39:11.171
(man coughing)

484
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:18.422
- No.

485
00:39:21.411 --> 00:39:24.411
(suspenseful music)

486
00:39:40.361 --> 00:39:42.392
- What the fuck.

487
00:39:42.392 --> 00:39:45.392
(suspenseful music)

488
00:39:57.151 --> 00:40:00.427
(Wayne gasping)

489
00:40:00.427 --> 00:40:03.427
(suspenseful music)

490
00:40:09.091 --> 00:40:11.924
(woman screaming)

491
00:40:13.938 --> 00:40:16.938
(suspenseful music)

492
00:40:29.066 --> 00:40:32.220
- And although these
stories sound plausible,


493
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:35.213
they crumble to myth at
the slightest of scrutiny.


494
00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:37.693
Urban folklore.

495
00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.920
Often these tall tales are rooted

496
00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.753
albeit it distantly, in truth.

497
00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.963
The Candy Man, for example,

498
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.800
and the old TV days,

499
00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:56.190
he was not a slave that was murdered

500
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:58.790
for falling in love with a white woman.

501
00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:03.763
Meet Dean Corll, the real Candy Man,

502
00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:08.040
who murdered 28 boys from
low-income housing projects,


503
00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.433
in Houston, in the early '70s.

504
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:19.073
Corll's family owned the
candy factory, by the way.


505
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:21.783
Hence the moniker.

506
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:28.494
Then again, in Houston in 1974,

507
00:41:28.494 --> 00:41:33.150
Ronald O'Bryan gained infamy
as yet another Candy Man


508
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:36.820
after lacing Halloween treats with cyanide

509
00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.280
and distributing them to several children,

510
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.383
including his own.

511
00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.140
And ever since then, superstitious parents

512
00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:48.600
insist on x-raying their
children's Halloween candy


513
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.083
for razorblades.

514
00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:57.690
But there's never been a proven case

515
00:41:57.690 --> 00:42:01.930
where a stranger has intentionally
tried to harm children


516
00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:04.103
by tampering with Halloween candy.

517
00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:09.000
You see, O'Bryan's motive, apparently,

518
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.600
was to collect the insurance payouts

519
00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.183
on his children's policies.

520
00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.940
He gave poison candy to their friends

521
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:19.400
as a means of making the poisonings

522
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.013
look less targeted
towards his own children,


523
00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.003
thereby it gained momentum.

524
00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:29.740
And although these real life stories

525
00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:33.330
have candy and urban
environments as elements,


526
00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:37.660
they have nothing to do with
repeating names into mirrors


527
00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.323
or hooks for hands, I'm afraid.

528
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.033
Mr. Vittol.

529
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:45.730
- Dr. Gordon, what about snuff films?

530
00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:47.093
- You read my dissertation.

531
00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:49.643
Same thing.

532
00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.620
Not a single law enforcement
agency in the world


533
00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:57.520
has been able to obtain
any proof whatsoever


534
00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:00.140
that anyone has ever been paid

535
00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:04.193
to murder another human being
on camera for entertainment.


536
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.210
In fact, the million dollar
reward for verifiable proof


537
00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:14.333
that even the existence of one
snuff film actually exists,


538
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.603
remains unclaimed for decades.

539
00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:20.460
Now that's not to say

540
00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:23.170
that there hasn't been
some convincing fakes,


541
00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:27.350
most notably in 1991, actor Charlie Sheen,

542
00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:30.430
watched a Japanese film
so graphic in nature,


543
00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:33.963
he was convinced it
had to be a snuff film.


544
00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:39.223
He was so shaken that
he took the VHS tape,


545
00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:41.560
yes, VHS tape.

546
00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:42.850
(all laughing)

547
00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:44.743
To the FBI in a panic.

548
00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.640
Well agents quickly deduced
that it was clearly staged


549
00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.793
as part of a horror film
series and nothing more.


550
00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:59.183
Now with the agents having
a good laugh at his expense,


551
00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:05.417
Mr. Sheen was not winning
that day, I can assure you.


552
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:09.420
- What about red
rooms on the dark web?

553
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:13.780
You know like not indexed, hidden websites

554
00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:16.080
where you can literally
get anything you want,


555
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:21.560
guns, drugs, contract
hits, shit like that.


556
00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:23.797
- Wayne, if I recall correctly,

557
00:44:23.797 --> 00:44:26.090
"Silk Road" was shut down in 2013.

558
00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:28.790
- But there are other websites
out there just like it.


559
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:31.490
- Do I smell a thesis?

560
00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:35.773
- Yeah.

561
00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:37.830
Yeah, I think so.

562
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:41.300
- And you'd like to explore
this snuff film myth


563
00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:44.274
as it pertains to folklore
in the internet age.


564
00:44:44.274 --> 00:44:46.024
- Yeah, more or less.

565
00:44:47.018 --> 00:44:49.685
(gentle music)

566
00:45:24.185 --> 00:45:25.018
Oh shit.

567
00:45:30.901 --> 00:45:34.048
- [Man] We can see you Wayne.

568
00:45:34.048 --> 00:45:36.215
And the camera behind you.

569
00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:44.161
We want to see you turn that
camera off before we do.


570
00:45:44.161 --> 00:45:46.448
(suspenseful music)

571
00:45:46.448 --> 00:45:47.281
Now Wayne.

572
00:46:05.108 --> 00:46:06.655
Showtime.

573
00:46:06.655 --> 00:46:09.078
(suspenseful music)

574
00:46:09.078 --> 00:46:10.190
- Oh God, no.

575
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:13.724
(suspenseful music)

576
00:46:13.724 --> 00:46:16.671
- [Man] We can hear you Wayne.

577
00:46:16.671 --> 00:46:20.921
You don't have to type all
those big college words.


578
00:46:24.419 --> 00:46:25.336
Now decide.

579
00:46:29.253 --> 00:46:32.170
If you want, we can choose for you.

580
00:46:33.013 --> 00:46:35.930
How about a nice Columbian necktie?

581
00:46:37.643 --> 00:46:38.476
- No, no.

582
00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:40.640
No, just stop,

583
00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.468
stop, please stop.

584
00:46:42.468 --> 00:46:45.051
(gentle music)

585
00:46:45.963 --> 00:46:47.454
How much to spare his life?

586
00:46:47.454 --> 00:46:50.303
- [Man] You're out of Bitcoins Wayne.

587
00:46:50.303 --> 00:46:54.233
But you still got nearly 10,000
in your checking account,


588
00:46:54.233 --> 00:46:55.807
that will do.

589
00:46:55.807 --> 00:46:58.474
(gentle music)

590
00:47:02.325 --> 00:47:03.158
- Okay.

591
00:47:04.411 --> 00:47:06.328
Okay, just tell me how.

592
00:47:07.441 --> 00:47:11.415
- [Man] Tomorrow, you
will receive instructions.


593
00:47:11.415 --> 00:47:14.959
And don't even think about
involving the police.


594
00:47:14.959 --> 00:47:16.209
Or he will die.

595
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:19.003
- No.

596
00:47:19.857 --> 00:47:22.440
(gentle music)

597
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:37.583
(car engine revving)

598
00:47:46.719 --> 00:47:49.469
(birds chirping)

599
00:48:02.423 --> 00:48:05.006
(gentle music)

600
00:48:14.657 --> 00:48:17.813
- [Man] Come inside Wayne,
to make the exchange.


601
00:48:17.813 --> 00:48:19.310
- Can I just leave this here

602
00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:21.660
and you send him up to the door?

603
00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:22.493
You know, that way I never.

604
00:48:22.493 --> 00:48:24.160
- [Man] Come inside.

605
00:48:26.701 --> 00:48:29.451
There are still plans to discuss.

606
00:48:36.133 --> 00:48:39.216
You can leave the money on the table.

607
00:48:40.161 --> 00:48:42.744
(gentle music)

608
00:48:45.832 --> 00:48:48.165
I will trust it's all there.

609
00:48:49.336 --> 00:48:53.169
- [Victim] Here, I'm in
here, don't let me go.


610
00:48:54.815 --> 00:48:57.398
(gentle music)

611
00:49:10.918 --> 00:49:11.918
- It's okay.

612
00:49:14.824 --> 00:49:17.824
(suspenseful music)

613
00:49:27.201 --> 00:49:29.118
- Remain seated please.

614
00:49:34.161 --> 00:49:39.161
- Dr. Gordon, I came to help you.

615
00:49:44.879 --> 00:49:49.462
Dr. Gordon, I came to help
you, why are you doing this?


616
00:49:50.707 --> 00:49:53.707
(suspenseful music)

617
00:50:03.143 --> 00:50:05.726
(Wayne crying)

618
00:50:07.958 --> 00:50:10.958
(suspenseful music)

619
00:50:31.417 --> 00:50:32.334
- Showtime.

620
00:50:36.274 --> 00:50:38.857
(gentle music)

621
00:51:03.096 --> 00:51:06.013
(car horn honking)

622
00:51:07.835 --> 00:51:10.918
(suspenseful music)

623
00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:46.043
(cellphone ringing)

624
00:51:51.529 --> 00:51:53.603
- As authorities are
continuing their investigation,


625
00:51:53.603 --> 00:51:56.740
they're urging everyone to stay indoors.

626
00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:59.260
They believe the infection may be airborne

627
00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:01.256
and it can be passed
through casual contact.


628
00:52:01.256 --> 00:52:02.680
- No, change that.

629
00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.600
- Please continue

630
00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.180
to stay in your homes.
- Dad, I'm scared.


631
00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.440
- Do not let anybody in.

632
00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:10.490
We will stay with you throughout the day.

633
00:52:12.999 --> 00:52:14.550
- Jennifer.

634
00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:17.550
(suspenseful music)

635
00:52:32.347 --> 00:52:33.180
- God.

636
00:52:38.356 --> 00:52:39.733
- Let me in, please, I need you.

637
00:52:39.733 --> 00:52:41.650
- What happened to you?

638
00:52:42.495 --> 00:52:44.495
- Please just let me in.

639
00:52:47.906 --> 00:52:49.739
Just don't let me die.

640
00:52:52.761 --> 00:52:54.178
Don't let me die.

641
00:52:55.388 --> 00:52:58.388
(suspenseful music)

642
00:52:59.856 --> 00:53:02.523
(man screaming)

643
00:53:09.485 --> 00:53:10.318
Let me in.

644
00:53:11.426 --> 00:53:12.259
Let me in.

645
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:16.670
(suspenseful music)

646
00:53:19.371 --> 00:53:20.415
- Everything's busy.

647
00:53:20.415 --> 00:53:22.920
I have tried Jennifer, 911, my mom.

648
00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:26.520
- Probably all jammed up, cable's out too.

649
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:27.850
- What's going on?

650
00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:28.813
- Come here, honey.

651
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.130
- I'll be right back.

652
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:38.370
- Where are you going?

653
00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:40.860
- My dad's old scanner in the attic,

654
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:42.260
I wanna see what's going on.

655
00:53:45.948 --> 00:53:49.031
(suspenseful music)

656
00:53:50.926 --> 00:53:53.429
- What are you doing, Brad?

657
00:53:53.429 --> 00:53:56.429
(suspenseful music)

658
00:54:28.349 --> 00:54:31.182
(woman screaming)

659
00:54:35.871 --> 00:54:39.121
(car tires screeching)

660
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:49.280
- "They're here."

661
00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:53.180
Was the message sent out by The Pentagon.

662
00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:56.342
This footage was sent
to us by a viewer.

663
00:54:56.342 --> 00:54:59.792
(suspenseful music)

664
00:54:59.792 --> 00:55:00.875
- [Girl] Mom.

665
00:55:02.269 --> 00:55:03.102
Dad.

666
00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:09.894
- You'll have nightmares.

667
00:55:09.894 --> 00:55:11.250
- What was that?

668
00:55:12.507 --> 00:55:13.757
- I don't know.

669
00:55:16.232 --> 00:55:19.232
(suspenseful music)

670
00:55:26.953 --> 00:55:30.036
(cellphone ringing)

671
00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.460
- We are waiting on President
Armstrong to make a statement.


672
00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:44.510
We've been told the
president will be speaking


673
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:48.030
from the Presidential
Emergency Operations Center.


674
00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:51.000
The PEOC was built by FDR

675
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.040
under the east wing of The White House

676
00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:57.600
to provide a secure place in
the event of an emergency.


677
00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:00.650
We are going to the president now.

678
00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:03.460
- My fellow Americans and
citizens of the earth,


679
00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:05.330
we are under attack.

680
00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:07.940
The enemy is of an alien nature.

681
00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:11.350
All attempts to communicate
with the aliens have failed.


682
00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:14.250
The CDC, NASA and The Military

683
00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:17.270
are working together to find answers.

684
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:19.570
I urge you to stay in your homes

685
00:56:19.570 --> 00:56:22.250
while solution is investigated.

686
00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:24.120
What we know at this time

687
00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:27.340
is these aliens are symbiotic by nature

688
00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:29.420
and are moving from host to host

689
00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:32.330
in an attempt to find nourishment.

690
00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:34.200
They are small creatures,

691
00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:37.290
similar to ants in collective behavior

692
00:56:37.290 --> 00:56:40.613
and transfer from host
to host through the eyes.


693
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:44.560
Signs of infection include pasty skin,

694
00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:48.680
a look of fatigue
and red or bloody eyes.

695
00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:52.370
Now we do know that if a
symbiote does not find a new host


696
00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:55.270
within minutes of leaving a deceased host,

697
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:57.820
that symbiote will die.

698
00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:01.540
As we look for resistance
for those infected,


699
00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:06.530
I urge you to protect yourselves,
seal your environment,


700
00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:09.550
do not leave your
home or place of work

701
00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:12.510
and do not open windows
or doors for anyone.


702
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:14.523
They may be infected.

703
00:57:14.523 --> 00:57:17.606
(suspenseful music)

704
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:30.703
- Help me.

705
00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:35.860
Need scissors.

706
00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:36.980
- I'll get them.

707
00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:38.340
- What are you doing?

708
00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:39.173
- [Man] Hold this.

709
00:57:39.173 --> 00:57:41.070
- No, why are we doing this?

710
00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:41.903
- Didn't you see the president?

711
00:57:41.903 --> 00:57:44.330
- No, I shut off the TV.

712
00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:45.530
- There's been some kind of invasion,

713
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:49.150
small ant-like creatures,
they get in through your eyes.


714
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:51.466
They control you to their
next source of nourishment.


715
00:57:51.466 --> 00:57:53.510
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

716
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:56.100
So they're saying, we're food?

717
00:57:59.357 --> 00:58:00.190
- Got 'em.

718
00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:06.670
- We seal this
place up, best we can

719
00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.630
and then stay put.

720
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:12.630
(suspenseful music)

721
00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:20.352
- What about sis?

722
00:58:20.352 --> 00:58:23.352
(suspenseful music)

723
00:58:38.352 --> 00:58:41.685
(car brakes screeching)

724
00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:44.819
- I didn't see you.

725
00:58:44.819 --> 00:58:46.575
I'm so sorry.

726
00:58:46.575 --> 00:58:47.992
- Don't let them.

727
00:58:50.654 --> 00:58:51.904
Don't let them.

728
00:58:54.584 --> 00:58:55.856
No, no.

729
00:58:55.856 --> 00:58:58.856
(suspenseful music)

730
00:59:45.726 --> 00:59:47.486
- Darling, we need more tape.

731
00:59:47.486 --> 00:59:48.319
- Okay.

732
00:59:51.070 --> 00:59:54.586
(suspenseful music)

733
00:59:54.586 --> 00:59:55.419
Mom,

734
00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:57.270
Dad.

735
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:58.913
- [Woman] What is it baby?

736
00:59:58.913 --> 01:00:00.443
(suspenseful music)

737
01:00:00.443 --> 01:00:01.276
Jenny.

738
01:00:02.163 --> 01:00:03.627
- What, where?

739
01:00:03.627 --> 01:00:05.450
- She was just there.

740
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:06.560
- There's no one out there.

741
01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.770
- [Girl] I could have
sworn I just saw her.


742
01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:11.083
- Let's go get some more tape.

743
01:00:14.853 --> 01:00:17.853
(suspenseful music)

744
01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.678
Jenny.

745
01:00:21.678 --> 01:00:23.332
Jenny.

746
01:00:23.332 --> 01:00:26.332
(suspenseful music)

747
01:00:32.272 --> 01:00:33.809
Jenny's outside.

748
01:00:33.809 --> 01:00:35.330
- [Girl] Dad.

749
01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:36.163
- Help.

750
01:00:37.409 --> 01:00:38.242
- Jenny.

751
01:00:40.277 --> 01:00:41.110
We can't.

752
01:00:41.110 --> 01:00:43.889
- We can't save our daughter?

753
01:00:43.889 --> 01:00:45.639
- She's dead already.

754
01:00:48.694 --> 01:00:51.361
(gentle music)

755
01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:55.100
- Since mankind first
saw it's own reflection,


756
01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.250
we have been fascinated by her own image

757
01:01:57.250 --> 01:01:59.400
staring back at us.

758
01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.230
Ancient cultures believed that a mirror

759
01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:02.723
was a reflection of the soul.

760
01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.493
Which is why breaking it is bad luck.

761
01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:10.570
And why vampires have no reflection

762
01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:14.820
because they have no soul.

763
01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:15.986
Others like myself.

764
01:02:15.986 --> 01:02:16.819
(girls laughing)

765
01:02:16.819 --> 01:02:19.243
Believe they are a portal
to other dimensions.


766
01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:28.003
Whatever you do do not
think about a white bear.


767
01:02:33.370 --> 01:02:34.810
That's right.

768
01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:37.893
Do not think about a white bear.

769
01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:41.030
There was a study once

770
01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:44.430
where people were told not
to think about a white bear,


771
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:47.200
they spent the next few minutes
trying everything they could


772
01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.500
to not think about a white bear,

773
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.910
but failed.

774
01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:52.410
Why?

775
01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:55.060
When we try to suppress a
thought, two things happen.


776
01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:57.970
We consciously searched for thoughts

777
01:02:57.970 --> 01:02:59.953
that do not involve white bears.

778
01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:03.140
Conversely, we analyze each thought

779
01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:06.140
to make sure they don't
involve white bears.


780
01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:11.140
The problem is both thought
processes involve white bears.


781
01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:17.750
So when you go home tonight
and you look into the mirror,


782
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:21.474
do not say, "Mirror, mirror on the wall."

783
01:03:21.474 --> 01:03:24.141
(all laughing)

784
01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:28.733
But seriously,

785
01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.727
never ever look into the mirror and say,

786
01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:38.607
"No devil, never odd or even, lived on."

787
01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:42.733
See you on Monday.

788
01:03:58.645 --> 01:04:01.728
(suspenseful music)

789
01:04:08.989 --> 01:04:10.897
- No devil never odd or even.

790
01:04:10.897 --> 01:04:13.910
(telephone ringing)

791
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:15.100
Hey Jill, what's up?

792
01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:17.980
- [Jill] Are you coming to the party?

793
01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:19.417
- I'm getting ready now.

794
01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:21.940
Are you guys already there?

795
01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:23.540
- [Jill] Yeah, we just got here.

796
01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:27.550
- Well text me if Zack's there.

797
01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:29.250
- [Jill] Girl, you need to stop

798
01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:31.910
obsessing about your ex-boyfriend.

799
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:33.033
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

800
01:04:39.945 --> 01:04:41.150
Hah.

801
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:42.100
- [Jill] Hah, what?

802
01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:44.723
Shannon?

803
01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:46.680
- Do you remember the phrase

804
01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.750
the professor said in class today?

805
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:49.780
- [Jill] The white bear?

806
01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:52.733
- No devil, never
odd or even, lived on.

807
01:04:53.638 --> 01:04:55.980
- [Jill] Oh yeah, now I remember.

808
01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:59.520
Hey, make sure you don't say
while looking into a mirror.


809
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.673
- Too late, I think I already did.

810
01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.700
- [Jill] Whatever.

811
01:05:04.778 --> 01:05:07.100
Hurry your ass up, we're here

812
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:11.220
and so is Zack, FYI.

813
01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:14.630
- All right, see you later, bye.

814
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:15.463
- [Jill] Later.

815
01:05:16.325 --> 01:05:19.408
(suspenseful music)

816
01:05:30.379 --> 01:05:32.675
(Shannon screaming)

817
01:05:32.675 --> 01:05:34.033
- Hello Shannon.

818
01:05:35.779 --> 01:05:36.779
- Oh my God.

819
01:05:45.147 --> 01:05:47.230
- Thanks for inviting me.

820
01:05:51.905 --> 01:05:53.095
(Shannon choking)

821
01:05:53.095 --> 01:05:54.553
- Hello.

822
01:05:54.553 --> 01:05:55.501
Shannon.

823
01:05:55.501 --> 01:05:56.553
(Shannon screaming)

824
01:05:56.553 --> 01:05:57.386
Shannon.

825
01:05:58.235 --> 01:05:59.867
Oh my God.

826
01:05:59.867 --> 01:06:02.867
(Shannon screaming)

827
01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:16.645
(glass vase breaking)

828
01:06:16.645 --> 01:06:19.728
(suspenseful music)

829
01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.940
- [Operator] 911, what's your emergency?

830
01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:29.222
- I think something's
happened to my friend.


831
01:06:29.222 --> 01:06:32.222
(suspenseful music)

832
01:06:35.606 --> 01:06:38.439
(camera clicking)

833
01:06:43.837 --> 01:06:46.920
(suspenseful music)

834
01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:01.540
She was supposed to meet up
with us, but then I got a call.


835
01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:02.813
She was screaming.

836
01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:07.110
- Did you hear anything
else, another person maybe?


837
01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:10.023
- No, just screaming.

838
01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:16.370
- Green, I think I found something.

839
01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:19.223
No devil, never odd or even, lived on.

840
01:07:20.138 --> 01:07:22.250
Does that mean anything to you?

841
01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:23.740
- Doesn't sound familiar.

842
01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.710
- It's from class.

843
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:26.610
- What does it mean?

844
01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:27.443
- I don't know.

845
01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:28.430
Just our psych professor

846
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:29.530
told us you should never say it

847
01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:31.230
in front of a mirror or something.

848
01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:34.100
- The girls say it's some superstition

849
01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:36.682
about opening portals in the mirror.

850
01:07:36.682 --> 01:07:39.765
(suspenseful music)

851
01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:46.570
- What time was the?

852
01:07:48.590 --> 01:07:49.493
Roberts?

853
01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:53.683
Roberts?

854
01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:55.753
Wait here.

855
01:07:59.850 --> 01:08:00.683
Roberts?

856
01:08:03.649 --> 01:08:05.470
I hope this works.

857
01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:09.377
No devil, never odd or even, lived on.

858
01:08:09.377 --> 01:08:11.329
(gun firing)

859
01:08:11.329 --> 01:08:14.329
(suspenseful music)

860
01:08:32.382 --> 01:08:35.215
(Green screaming)

861
01:08:37.812 --> 01:08:38.646
Help me.

862
01:08:43.673 --> 01:08:44.506
No.

863
01:08:45.779 --> 01:08:46.612
No.

864
01:08:51.086 --> 01:08:53.503
(gun firing)

865
01:09:00.828 --> 01:09:01.859
Easy, easy.

866
01:09:01.859 --> 01:09:02.840
You're safe.

867
01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.230
- The professor.

868
01:09:04.230 --> 01:09:06.771
- He's not gonna hurt
you anymore all right.


869
01:09:06.771 --> 01:09:08.943
Let's get outta here.
- Hello.


870
01:09:08.943 --> 01:09:09.775
Detective.

871
01:09:11.841 --> 01:09:14.050
(mirror knocking)

872
01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:14.882
Are you there?

873
01:09:19.079 --> 01:09:20.403
- Jill, Brandi.

874
01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:23.753
- How do you
suppose we get outta here?

875
01:09:23.753 --> 01:09:24.586
- [Jill] Are you there?

876
01:09:24.586 --> 01:09:27.623
- I think we have to say
the phrase backwards.


877
01:09:27.623 --> 01:09:29.942
- [Jill] Hello, detective.

878
01:09:29.942 --> 01:09:32.510
- Backwards seems forwards.

879
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:33.668
- Yeah, I know.

880
01:09:33.668 --> 01:09:35.712
(both laughing)

881
01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:37.462
- I think we should say the phrase.

882
01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:39.513
- No way.

883
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:44.413
- [Both] No devil, never
odd or even, lived on.


884
01:09:49.885 --> 01:09:52.802
(Brandi screaming)

885
01:09:53.712 --> 01:09:54.655
- Shannon.

886
01:09:54.655 --> 01:09:57.238
(all laughing)

887
01:09:58.247 --> 01:09:59.080
Oh no.

888
01:10:00.482 --> 01:10:03.649
(gentle upbeat music)

889
01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:35.180
- Hey, can you take this
box to the book store,


890
01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:37.080
I think it closes in an hour.
