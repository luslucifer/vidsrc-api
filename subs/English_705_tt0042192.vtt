1
00:01:08.942 --> 00:01:13.613
The Sarah Siddons Award
is perhaps unknown to you.


2
00:01:13.697 --> 00:01:16.616
It has been spared
the sensational publicity


3
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.119
of such questionable honors
as the Pulitzer Prize


4
00:01:20.204 --> 00:01:25.041
and those awards presented annually
by that film society.


5
00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:29.128
The distinguished-looking gentleman
is an extremely old actor.


6
00:01:29.213 --> 00:01:32.632
Being an actor,
he will go on speaking for some time.


7
00:01:32.716 --> 00:01:35.802
It is not important
that you hear what he says.


8
00:01:35.886 --> 00:01:40.139
However, it is important that you know
where you are and why you are here.


9
00:01:40.224 --> 00:01:43.810
This is the dining hall
of the Sarah Siddons Society.


10
00:01:43.894 --> 00:01:49.398
It is the annual banquet and presentation
of the highest honor our theatre has:


11
00:01:49.525 --> 00:01:53.152
the Sarah Siddons Award for
Distinguished Achievement.


12
00:01:53.237 --> 00:01:56.072
These hallowed walls,
indeed many of these faces,


13
00:01:56.198 --> 00:02:00.326
have looked upon Modjeska,
Ada Rehan and Minnie Fiske.


14
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.663
Mansfield's voice filled this room.

15
00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:07.583
It is unlikely that the windows
have been opened since his death.


16
00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:12.505
The minor awards, as you can see,
have already been presented.


17
00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:16.092
Minor awards are for such
as the writer and director,


18
00:02:16.176 --> 00:02:18.845
since they merely construct a tower

19
00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:22.849
so that the world can applaud
a light which flashes on top of it.


20
00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:27.353
And no brighter light has ever
dazzled the eye than Eve Harrington.


21
00:02:27.437 --> 00:02:30.773
Eve... But more of Eve later.

22
00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:33.025
All about Eve, in fact.

23
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.069
To those who do not read,

24
00:02:35.153 --> 00:02:38.865
attend the theatre,
listen to unsponsored radio programs


25
00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:41.701
or know anything of the world
in which you live,


26
00:02:41.785 --> 00:02:45.204
it is perhaps necessary
to introduce myself.


27
00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:47.456
My name is Addison DeWitt.

28
00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:53.212
My native habitat is the theatre.
In it, I toil not. Neither do I spin.


29
00:02:53.297 --> 00:02:55.798
I am a critic and commentator.

30
00:02:55.924 --> 00:02:58.551
I am essential to the theatre.

31
00:02:58.635 --> 00:03:00.720
This is Karen Richards.

32
00:03:00.804 --> 00:03:05.308
She is the wife of a playwright,
therefore of the theatre by marriage.


33
00:03:05.434 --> 00:03:09.520
Nothing in her background should have
brought her closer to the stage


34
00:03:09.605 --> 00:03:11.856
than Row E.

35
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.525
However,
during her senior year at Radcliffe,


36
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.986
Lloyd Richards lectured on the drama.

37
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.157
The following year
Karen became Mrs. Lloyd Richards.


38
00:03:21.283 --> 00:03:24.994
There are, in general,
two types of theatrical producers.


39
00:03:25.078 --> 00:03:29.582
One has a great many wealthy friends
who will risk a tax-deductible loss.


40
00:03:29.666 --> 00:03:32.084
This type is interested in art.

41
00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:36.589
The other is one to whom each production
means potential ruin or fortune.


42
00:03:36.673 --> 00:03:38.758
This type is out to make a buck.

43
00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:41.177
Meet Max Fabian.

44
00:03:41.303 --> 00:03:43.054
He is the producer of the play

45
00:03:43.138 --> 00:03:47.350
which has won for Eve Harrington
the Sarah Siddons Award.


46
00:03:48.185 --> 00:03:51.854
Margo Channing is a star of the theatre.

47
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.274
She made her first stage appearance at
the age of four


48
00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.735
in Midsummer Night's Dream.

49
00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.448
She played a fairy and entered,
quite unexpectedly, stark naked.


50
00:04:02.532 --> 00:04:05.034
She has been a star ever since.

51
00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:09.121
Margo is a great star. A true star.

52
00:04:09.206 --> 00:04:13.209
She never was or will be
anything less or anything else.


53
00:04:14.795 --> 00:04:20.549
Having covered in tedious detail not only
the history of the Sarah Siddons Society,


54
00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:22.468
but also the history of acting

55
00:04:22.552 --> 00:04:26.138
since Thespis
first stepped out of the chorus line,


56
00:04:26.223 --> 00:04:30.559
our distinguished chairman has finally
arrived at our reason for being here.


57
00:04:30.686 --> 00:04:36.983
I have been proud and privileged
to have spent my life in the theatre,


58
00:04:37.067 --> 00:04:42.071
a poor player that struts
and frets his hour upon the stage,


59
00:04:42.739 --> 00:04:45.658
and I've been honored
to be, for 40 years,

60
00:04:45.742 --> 00:04:49.704
chief prompter
of the Sarah Siddons Society.


61
00:04:50.747 --> 00:04:55.584
39 times have I placed in deserving hands

62
00:04:55.711 --> 00:04:59.338
this highest honor the theatre knows.

63
00:04:59.423 --> 00:05:02.341
Surely no actor is older than I.

64
00:05:02.426 --> 00:05:05.052
I've earned my place out of the sun.

65
00:05:06.596 --> 00:05:12.435
And never before has this award gone to
anyone younger than its recipient tonight.


66
00:05:12.561 --> 00:05:16.731
How fitting that it should
pass from my hands to hers.


67
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.568
Such young hands. 
Such a young lady.

68
00:05:20.944 --> 00:05:25.573
Young in years, but whose heart
is as old as the theatre.


69
00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.034
Some of us are privileged to know her.

70
00:05:28.118 --> 00:05:31.454
We have seen
beyond the beauty and artistry


71
00:05:31.538 --> 00:05:34.790
that have made her name
resound through the nation.


72
00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:38.794
We know her humility, her devotion,

73
00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:40.963
her loyalty to her art,

74
00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:45.634
her love, her deep
and abiding love for us,

75
00:05:45.761 --> 00:05:50.473
for what we are
and what we do, the theatre.


76
00:05:50.932 --> 00:05:53.309
She has had one wish,

77
00:05:53.435 --> 00:05:56.145
one prayer, one dream,

78
00:05:57.314 --> 00:05:59.815
to belong to us.

79
00:06:00.108 --> 00:06:02.485
Tonight her dream has come true,

80
00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:06.405
and henceforth
we shall dream the same of her.


81
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.243
Ladies and gentlemen, for distinguished
achievement in the theatre,


82
00:06:11.328 --> 00:06:15.331
the Sarah Siddons Award
to Miss Eve Harrington.


83
00:06:39.523 --> 00:06:40.523
Bravo!

84
00:06:55.622 --> 00:06:59.625
Eve.
Eve, the golden girl. The cover girl.


85
00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:04.130
The girl next door, the girl on the moon.
Time has been good to Eve.


86
00:07:04.214 --> 00:07:09.385
Life goes where she goes. She's been
profiled, covered, revealed, reported,


87
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:12.388
what she eats and what
she wears and whom she knows


88
00:07:12.514 --> 00:07:15.641
and where she was and
when and where she's going.


89
00:07:15.725 --> 00:07:17.560
Eve.

90
00:07:17.686 --> 00:07:20.187
You all know all about Eve.

91
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:23.732
What can there be to know
that you don't know?


92
00:07:24.985 --> 00:07:27.820
When was it? How long?

93
00:07:27.904 --> 00:07:30.573
It seems a lifetime ago.

94
00:07:30.657 --> 00:07:33.325
Lloyd always said that in the theatre
a lifetime was a season


95
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.244
and a season a lifetime.

96
00:07:35.328 --> 00:07:39.039
It's June now. 
That was early October.

97
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.168
Only last October.

98
00:07:44.254 --> 00:07:48.007
It was a drizzly night.
I remember I asked the taxi to wait.


99
00:07:54.556 --> 00:07:56.015
Where was she?

100
00:07:56.099 --> 00:08:00.769
Strange. I'd become so accustomed
to seeing her there night after night,


101
00:08:00.854 --> 00:08:04.023
I found myself looking for a girl
I'd never spoken to.


102
00:08:04.107 --> 00:08:06.609
Wondering where she was.

103
00:08:11.948 --> 00:08:14.241
Mrs. Richards?

104
00:08:15.285 --> 00:08:17.703
There you are.

105
00:08:17.787 --> 00:08:22.041
It seemed odd, suddenly,
your not being here.


106
00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:25.544
-Why should you think I wouldn't be?
-Why should you be?


107
00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:27.379
Six nights a week for weeks

108
00:08:27.464 --> 00:08:30.299
of watching even Margo Channing
enter and leave a theatre.


109
00:08:30.425 --> 00:08:33.135
-You don't mind my speaking to you?
-Not at all.


110
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.972
I've seen you so often.
It took every bit of courage I could raise.


111
00:08:37.057 --> 00:08:39.642
To speak to just a playwright's wife?

112
00:08:39.726 --> 00:08:42.144
I'm the lowest form of celebrity.

113
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:46.565
You're Margo Channing's best friend.
You and your husband are always with her.


114
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:50.486
And Mr. Sampson. 
What's he like?

115
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.989
Bill Sampson? He's a director.

116
00:08:54.074 --> 00:08:56.325
-He's the best.
-He'll agree with you.


117
00:08:56.409 --> 00:09:01.497
Tell me. What do you do in between
the time Margo goes in and comes out?


118
00:09:01.581 --> 00:09:04.083
Just huddle in that doorway and wait?

119
00:09:04.167 --> 00:09:07.169
Oh, no. I see the play.

120
00:09:07.254 --> 00:09:11.924
You see the play? You've seen
every performance of this play?


121
00:09:12.008 --> 00:09:14.093
Yes.

122
00:09:14.177 --> 00:09:15.511
But don't you find it...

123
00:09:15.595 --> 00:09:18.847
Apart from everything else,
don't you find it expensive?


124
00:09:18.974 --> 00:09:22.101
Standing room doesn't cost much.
I manage.


125
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.355
-I'm gonna take you to Margo.
-Oh, no!


126
00:09:26.481 --> 00:09:30.109
-Oh, yes. She's got to meet you.
-No, I'd be imposing on her.


127
00:09:30.193 --> 00:09:32.278
I'd be just another tongue-tied fan.

128
00:09:32.362 --> 00:09:35.614
There isn't another like you.
There couldn't be.


129
00:09:35.699 --> 00:09:38.450
If I'd known... Some other time.
Looking like this.


130
00:09:38.535 --> 00:09:42.121
You look just fine.
By the way, what's your name?


131
00:09:42.205 --> 00:09:44.290
Eve. Eve Harrington.

132
00:09:47.836 --> 00:09:51.046
-Good evening, Gus.
-Good evening, Mrs. Richards.


133
00:09:51.881 --> 00:09:53.966
-Good night.
-Good night, Gus.


134
00:10:13.194 --> 00:10:15.696
You can breathe it, can't you?

135
00:10:16.906 --> 00:10:19.408
Like some magic perfume.

136
00:10:28.001 --> 00:10:30.085
Wait right here. 
Don't run away.

137
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.505
"If the South had won,
you could write plays about the North."


138
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.924
-Hi.
-Hello!


139
00:10:36.051 --> 00:10:38.844
"I don't think
you can rightly say we lost the war."


140
00:10:38.928 --> 00:10:41.513
"We was more starved out,
you might say."


141
00:10:41.598 --> 00:10:45.601
"I don't understand all these plays
about love-starved Southern women."


142
00:10:45.685 --> 00:10:49.271
"Love is one thing we were
never starved for in the South."


143
00:10:49.397 --> 00:10:51.940
Margo's interview with
a reporter from the South.


144
00:10:52.067 --> 00:10:55.361
When it gets printed, they're
gonna fire on Gettysburg again.


145
00:10:55.445 --> 00:10:59.448
-It was Fort Sumter they fired on.
-I never played Fort Sumter.


146
00:11:01.034 --> 00:11:05.120
Honeychild had a point.
Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts.


147
00:11:05.205 --> 00:11:09.541
Write me one about a nice, normal woman
who just shoots her husband.


148
00:11:09.626 --> 00:11:12.127
-You need new girdles.
-Buy some.


149
00:11:12.253 --> 00:11:14.129
-Same size?
-Of course.


150
00:11:14.214 --> 00:11:17.299
I find these wisecracks
increasingly less funny.


151
00:11:17.425 --> 00:11:21.637
-Aged in Wood happens to be a fine play.
-That's my loyal little woman.


152
00:11:21.721 --> 00:11:24.223
The critics thought so.
The audiences think so.


153
00:11:24.307 --> 00:11:27.893
Packed houses, tickets
four months in advance.


154
00:11:27.977 --> 00:11:30.562
I can't see that Lloyd's plays
have hurt you any.


155
00:11:30.647 --> 00:11:34.733
-Easy now.
-Relax, kid, it's just me and my big mouth.


156
00:11:34.818 --> 00:11:37.861
You get me so mad sometimes.

157
00:11:37.946 --> 00:11:40.489
Of all the women
with nothing to complain about...


158
00:11:40.573 --> 00:11:42.741
-Ain't it the truth?
-Yes, it is.


159
00:11:42.826 --> 00:11:45.244
You're talented, famous, wealthy.

160
00:11:45.328 --> 00:11:49.581
People waiting around night after night
just to see you. Even in the rain.


161
00:11:49.666 --> 00:11:52.418
Autograph fiends. 
They're not people.

162
00:11:52.502 --> 00:11:55.087
Little beasts that run around in packs
like coyotes.


163
00:11:55.171 --> 00:11:58.006
-They're your fans.
-They're nobody's fans.


164
00:11:58.133 --> 00:12:01.927
They're juvenile delinquents.
They're nobody's audience.


165
00:12:02.011 --> 00:12:05.848
They never see a play or a movie.
They're never indoors long enough.


166
00:12:05.974 --> 00:12:09.351
Well, there's one indoors right now.

167
00:12:10.353 --> 00:12:12.938
-I've brought her back to see you.
-You've what?


168
00:12:13.356 --> 00:12:15.858
She's just outside the door.

169
00:12:15.984 --> 00:12:17.943
The heave-ho.

170
00:12:18.027 --> 00:12:20.696
But you can't put her out. I promised.

171
00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:22.739
Margo, you've got to see her.

172
00:12:22.824 --> 00:12:25.534
She worships you.
It's like something out of a book.


173
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.203
That book is out of print.
Those days are gone.


174
00:12:28.705 --> 00:12:31.540
But if you'd only see her.
You're her whole life.


175
00:12:31.624 --> 00:12:35.377
You must have spotted her by now.
She's always there.


176
00:12:35.462 --> 00:12:39.548
Oh, the mousy one with
the trench coat and the funny hat.


177
00:12:39.674 --> 00:12:42.718
How could I miss her?
Every night, every matinee.


178
00:12:46.306 --> 00:12:48.390
Come in, Eve.

179
00:12:51.686 --> 00:12:54.313
-I thought you'd forgotten about me.
-Not at all.


180
00:12:54.397 --> 00:12:56.565
Margo, this is Eve Harrington.

181
00:12:56.691 --> 00:12:59.151
-How do you do, my dear?
-Oh, brother.


182
00:12:59.235 --> 00:13:01.236
-Hello, Miss Channing.
-My husband.


183
00:13:01.321 --> 00:13:03.405
-Hello, Miss Harrington.
-How do you do?


184
00:13:03.531 --> 00:13:06.742
And this is my dear friend
and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.


185
00:13:06.826 --> 00:13:09.077
-Oh, brother.
-Miss Coonan.


186
00:13:09.162 --> 00:13:11.830
-Oh, brother, what?
-When she gets like this,


187
00:13:11.915 --> 00:13:14.082
she starts playing Hamlet's mother.

188
00:13:14.209 --> 00:13:18.003
I'm sure you must have things
to do in the bathroom, Birdie, dear.


189
00:13:18.087 --> 00:13:21.590
If I haven't, I'll find
something till you get normal.


190
00:13:25.178 --> 00:13:27.846
Won't you sit down, 
Miss Worthington?

191
00:13:27.931 --> 00:13:29.014
Harrington.

192
00:13:29.098 --> 00:13:32.893
-I'm so sorry. Won't you sit down?
-Thank you.


193
00:13:36.356 --> 00:13:37.439
Would you like a drink?

194
00:13:37.524 --> 00:13:40.275
I was saying how often
you've seen the play.


195
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.860
No, thank you.

196
00:13:41.945 --> 00:13:43.862
Yes, I've seen every performance.

197
00:13:43.947 --> 00:13:48.283
Every performance?
Then am I safe in assuming you like it?


198
00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:53.372
-I'd like anything Miss Channing played in.
-Would you really? How sweet.


199
00:13:53.456 --> 00:13:56.625
I doubt very much that
you'd like her in The Hairy Ape.


200
00:13:56.751 --> 00:13:59.545
Please don't misunderstand me,
Mr. Richards.


201
00:13:59.629 --> 00:14:04.383
I think part of Miss Channing's greatness
lies in her ability to pick the best plays.


202
00:14:04.467 --> 00:14:06.635
Your new play
is for Miss Channing, isn't it?


203
00:14:06.719 --> 00:14:08.637
Of course it is.

204
00:14:08.763 --> 00:14:12.391
-How did you hear about it?
-There was an item in The Times.


205
00:14:12.475 --> 00:14:15.310
I like the title, 
Footsteps on the Ceiling.

206
00:14:15.395 --> 00:14:17.396
Yes, but let's get back to this one.

207
00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.732
-Have you really seen every performance?
-Yes.


208
00:14:20.817 --> 00:14:22.818
Why? I'm curious.

209
00:14:22.944 --> 00:14:28.448
Well, if I didn't come to see the play,
I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.


210
00:14:28.616 --> 00:14:30.409
There are other plays.

211
00:14:30.493 --> 00:14:33.245
Not with you in
them. Not by Mr. Richards.

212
00:14:33.329 --> 00:14:36.790
But you must have friends,
a home, family?


213
00:14:39.085 --> 00:14:41.587
Tell us about it, Eve.

214
00:14:42.672 --> 00:14:45.841
-If I only knew how.
-Try.


215
00:14:47.343 --> 00:14:49.511
Well...

216
00:15:07.864 --> 00:15:11.116
Well, it started
with the play before this one.


217
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.535
-Remembrance.
-Remembrance.


218
00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.622
-Did you see it here in New York?
-San Francisco.


219
00:15:17.165 --> 00:15:20.208
It was the last week. 
I went one night.

220
00:15:20.293 --> 00:15:23.378
The most important night
of my life, until now.


221
00:15:23.463 --> 00:15:27.549
I found myself going the next night
and the next and the next.


222
00:15:27.675 --> 00:15:29.885
Every performance.

223
00:15:30.011 --> 00:15:33.805
Then, when the show went East,
I went East.


224
00:15:34.223 --> 00:15:38.894
-Eve, why don't you start at the beginning?
-Oh, it couldn't possibly interest you.


225
00:15:39.228 --> 00:15:41.313
Please.

226
00:15:42.023 --> 00:15:46.151
I guess it started back home.
Wisconsin, that is.


227
00:15:46.235 --> 00:15:48.570
It was just Mom and Dad and me.

228
00:15:48.696 --> 00:15:50.447
I was an only child.

229
00:15:50.531 --> 00:15:52.991
I used to make believe a lot
when I was a kid.


230
00:15:53.076 --> 00:15:57.079
Acted out all sorts of things.
What they were isn't important.


231
00:15:57.205 --> 00:16:02.250
But, somehow, acting and make-believe
began to fill up my life more and more.


232
00:16:03.044 --> 00:16:06.088
It got so I couldn't tell
the real from the unreal.


233
00:16:06.172 --> 00:16:09.508
Except that the unreal
seemed more real to me...


234
00:16:10.927 --> 00:16:14.596
-I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
-Not at all.


235
00:16:15.598 --> 00:16:20.268
Farmers were poor in those days.
That's what Dad was, a farmer.


236
00:16:20.395 --> 00:16:22.521
I had to help out.

237
00:16:22.605 --> 00:16:30.278
So I quit school, went to Milwaukee,
became a secretary in a brewery.


238
00:16:30.363 --> 00:16:35.617
When you're a secretary in a brewery, it's
hard to make believe you're anything else.


239
00:16:35.743 --> 00:16:37.703
Everything is beer.

240
00:16:38.955 --> 00:16:41.707
It wasn't much fun,
but it helped at home.

241
00:16:42.458 --> 00:16:48.130
And there was a little theatre group there,
like a drop of rain on the desert.


242
00:16:48.214 --> 00:16:50.298
That's where I met Eddie.

243
00:16:50.383 --> 00:16:53.301
He was a radio technician.

244
00:16:53.386 --> 00:16:56.096
We played Liliom for three performances.

245
00:16:57.265 --> 00:16:59.725
I was awful.

246
00:16:59.809 --> 00:17:03.395
Then the war came and we got married.

247
00:17:03.479 --> 00:17:05.564
Eddie was in the air force.

248
00:17:05.648 --> 00:17:08.150
They sent him to the South Pacific.

249
00:17:09.152 --> 00:17:12.821
You were with the OWI,
weren't you, Mr. Richards?


250
00:17:12.947 --> 00:17:14.197
That's what Who's Who says.

251
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:19.327
Well, with Eddie gone,
my life went back to beer.


252
00:17:19.412 --> 00:17:21.663
Except for a letter a week.

253
00:17:21.748 --> 00:17:25.000
One week he wrote me
he had leave coming up.


254
00:17:25.126 --> 00:17:30.422
I'd saved my money and vacation time
and went to San Francisco to meet him.


255
00:17:31.758 --> 00:17:34.342
But Eddie wasn't there.

256
00:17:34.469 --> 00:17:37.345
They forwarded the telegram
from Milwaukee.


257
00:17:37.472 --> 00:17:40.015
The one that came from Washington.

258
00:17:40.099 --> 00:17:43.018
To say that Eddie wasn't coming at all.

259
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.022
That Eddie was dead.

260
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:55.614
I figured I'd stay in San Francisco.

261
00:17:55.698 --> 00:17:59.159
I was alone.
I couldn't go back without Eddie.


262
00:18:00.536 --> 00:18:03.121
I found a job, and his insurance helped.

263
00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.793
And there were theatres in San Francisco.

264
00:18:07.877 --> 00:18:12.547
And then, one night, Margo Channing
came to play in Remembrance,


265
00:18:12.632 --> 00:18:14.716
and I went to see it.

266
00:18:17.053 --> 00:18:18.887
Well...

267
00:18:19.013 --> 00:18:21.139
Here I am.

268
00:18:26.729 --> 00:18:31.316
What a story. Everything but
the bloodhounds snapping at her rear end.


269
00:18:31.651 --> 00:18:36.154
There are some human experiences that
do not take place in a vaudeville house!


270
00:18:36.239 --> 00:18:40.534
And that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian
should understand and respect.


271
00:18:41.536 --> 00:18:46.373
-I want to apologize for Birdie.
-You don't have to apologize for me.


272
00:18:49.418 --> 00:18:54.422
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
It's just my way of talking.


273
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:57.175
You didn't hurt my feelings, Miss Coonan.

274
00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.344
Call me Birdie.

275
00:19:00.054 --> 00:19:02.347
And as for being fifth-rate,

276
00:19:02.431 --> 00:19:06.685
I closed the first half
for eleven years, and you know it.


277
00:19:13.276 --> 00:19:16.194
47 minutes from now my plane takes off
and how do I find you?


278
00:19:16.279 --> 00:19:19.197
-Not ready, looking like a junkyard.
-Thank you so much.


279
00:19:19.282 --> 00:19:22.701
Is it sabotage?
Have you no human consideration?


280
00:19:22.785 --> 00:19:26.621
-Show me a human and I might have.
-Airlines have clocks, even if you don't.


281
00:19:26.706 --> 00:19:29.958
I start shooting a week from Monday.
Zanuck is impatient.


282
00:19:30.084 --> 00:19:32.210
Zanuck, Zanuck!
What are you two? Lovers?


283
00:19:32.295 --> 00:19:35.130
-Only in some ways. You're prettier.
-I'm a junkyard.


284
00:19:35.256 --> 00:19:38.550
-Bill. This is Eve Harrington.
-Hi.


285
00:19:38.634 --> 00:19:43.221
My wonderful junkyard. The mystery
and dreams you find in a junkyard.


286
00:19:43.306 --> 00:19:45.140
Heaven help me.

287
00:19:45.266 --> 00:19:47.309
I love a psychotic.

288
00:19:49.103 --> 00:19:53.064
-Hello. What's your name?
-Eve Harrington.


289
00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:55.734
-You've already met.
-Huh? Where?


290
00:19:55.818 --> 00:19:59.946
-Right here, just a minute ago.
-That's nice.


291
00:20:03.326 --> 00:20:06.161
-You're not going, are you?
-I think I'd better.


292
00:20:06.287 --> 00:20:10.916
It's been... I can hardly find
the words to say how it's been.


293
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.001
No, don't go.

294
00:20:13.085 --> 00:20:18.089
The four of you must have so much to say
to each other with Mr. Sampson leaving.


295
00:20:19.008 --> 00:20:21.426
No, stick around, please.

296
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:26.765
Tell you what. We'll put Stanislavsky
on his plane, then go somewhere and talk.


297
00:20:26.849 --> 00:20:29.601
Well, if I'm not in the way...

298
00:20:29.685 --> 00:20:31.811
I won't be a minute.

299
00:20:35.858 --> 00:20:37.943
Lloyd, we've got to go.

300
00:20:43.199 --> 00:20:44.866
Good night, Margo.

301
00:20:44.992 --> 00:20:47.869
-I'll call you tomorrow.
-Not too early.


302
00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:55.043
-Good luck, genius.
-Geniuses don't need good luck. I do.


303
00:20:56.212 --> 00:20:59.881
-I'm not worried about you.
-Keep the thought.


304
00:21:00.174 --> 00:21:03.218
Good night, Eve.
I hope I see you again soon.


305
00:21:03.302 --> 00:21:08.306
-I'll be at the old stand tomorrow matinee.
-Not just that way. As a friend.


306
00:21:08.391 --> 00:21:10.475
I'd like that.

307
00:21:13.229 --> 00:21:17.315
-It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
-I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night.


308
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.734
Good night.

309
00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.736
Mrs. Richards?

310
00:21:21.904 --> 00:21:24.739
I'll never forget this night
as long as I live.

311
00:21:24.865 --> 00:21:28.243
And I'll never forget you
for making it possible.


312
00:21:33.541 --> 00:21:36.501
And I'll never forget you, Eve.

313
00:21:36.585 --> 00:21:39.838
Where were we going that night,
Lloyd and I?


314
00:21:39.922 --> 00:21:42.507
Funny, the things you remember

315
00:21:42.591 --> 00:21:44.426
and the things you don't.

316
00:21:53.436 --> 00:21:56.062
-So you're going to Hollywood?
-Mm-hm.


317
00:21:58.274 --> 00:22:01.276
-Why?
-I just wondered.


318
00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.362
-Just wondered what?
-Why?


319
00:22:05.114 --> 00:22:08.575
-Why what?
-Why you have to go out there.


320
00:22:09.577 --> 00:22:13.246
-I don't have to. I want to.
-Is it the money?


321
00:22:14.206 --> 00:22:16.416
80% of it'll go for taxes.

322
00:22:16.751 --> 00:22:21.296
Then why? Why, if you're the most
successful young director in the theatre...


323
00:22:21.464 --> 00:22:23.965
The theatre. The theatre.

324
00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:27.719
What rules say the theatre exists
only within some ugly buildings


325
00:22:27.803 --> 00:22:30.555
crowded into one
square mile of New York City?


326
00:22:30.639 --> 00:22:32.766
Or London, Paris or Vienna?

327
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:37.395
Listen, Junior, and learn.

328
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:42.400
Do you wanna know what the theatre is?
A flea circus. Also opera.


329
00:22:43.486 --> 00:22:46.237
Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets,

330
00:22:46.322 --> 00:22:50.575
Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy,
a one-man band, all theatre.


331
00:22:50.659 --> 00:22:55.663
Wherever there's magic and make-believe
and an audience, there's theatre.


332
00:22:56.791 --> 00:22:59.834
Donald Duck, Ibsen and The Lone Ranger.

333
00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.255
Sarah Bernhardt and Poodles Hanneford.
Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable.


334
00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:07.467
Rex the Wild Horse, Eleonora Duse,
all theatre.


335
00:23:08.094 --> 00:23:11.012
You don't understand them all.
You don't like them all.


336
00:23:11.097 --> 00:23:12.097
Why should you?

337
00:23:12.181 --> 00:23:16.226
The theatre's for everybody, you included,
but not exclusively.


338
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.937
So, don't approve or disapprove.

339
00:23:19.021 --> 00:23:22.857
It may not be your theatre,
but it's theatre for somebody, somewhere.


340
00:23:22.983 --> 00:23:25.485
I just asked a simple question.

341
00:23:26.529 --> 00:23:29.280
And I shot my mouth off.

342
00:23:29.365 --> 00:23:32.450
Nothing personal, Junior. No offense.

343
00:23:32.535 --> 00:23:37.872
It's just that there's so much bushwa in
this ivory greenroom they call the theatre,


344
00:23:37.998 --> 00:23:40.375
sometimes it gets up around my chin.

345
00:23:40.835 --> 00:23:43.878
But Hollywood.
You mustn't stay out there.


346
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:47.674
-It's only a one-picture deal.
-So few come back.


347
00:23:50.386 --> 00:23:53.638
I read George Jean Nathan every week.

348
00:23:53.722 --> 00:23:57.142
-Also Addison DeWitt.
-Every day.


349
00:23:58.686 --> 00:24:01.729
You didn't have to tell me.

350
00:24:01.814 --> 00:24:03.898
It's the latest thing, one earring.

351
00:24:03.983 --> 00:24:07.986
If it isn't, it's going to be.
I can't find the other one.


352
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.572
Throw that dreary letter away.
It bores me.


353
00:24:10.698 --> 00:24:13.908
-Where do you suppose it could be?
-It'll show up.


354
00:24:13.993 --> 00:24:17.162
Oh, I give up. Look in the wigs.
Maybe it got caught in one.


355
00:24:17.246 --> 00:24:20.081
Real diamonds in a wig.
The world we live in.


356
00:24:20.207 --> 00:24:23.084
-Where's my coat?
-Right where you left it.


357
00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.423
The seams.

358
00:24:28.924 --> 00:24:31.926
He can't take his eyes off my legs.

359
00:24:32.011 --> 00:24:34.095
Like a nylon lemon peel.

360
00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.348
Byron couldn't have said it
more graciously.


361
00:24:37.433 --> 00:24:39.517
Here we go.

362
00:24:40.269 --> 00:24:42.061
Got any messages?

363
00:24:42.146 --> 00:24:44.189
What do you want me
to tell Tyrone Power?


364
00:24:44.273 --> 00:24:47.609
Just give him my phone number.
I'll tell him myself.


365
00:24:48.277 --> 00:24:50.361
Kill the people.

366
00:24:52.114 --> 00:24:54.616
-You got your key?
-See you at home.


367
00:24:59.747 --> 00:25:03.458
I have a suggestion.
There's really not very much time left.


368
00:25:03.584 --> 00:25:06.294
I mean, you haven't had a minute
alone yet.


369
00:25:06.378 --> 00:25:10.798
And I could take care of everything here
and meet you at the gate with the ticket,


370
00:25:10.883 --> 00:25:12.884
if you'd like.

371
00:25:12.968 --> 00:25:14.886
I think we'd like very much.

372
00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:17.472
-Sure you won't mind?
-Of course not.


373
00:25:27.316 --> 00:25:31.486
-She's quite a girl, this whatshername.
-Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way.


374
00:25:31.612 --> 00:25:35.657
That lack of pretense, that strange
directness and understanding.


375
00:25:35.783 --> 00:25:38.409
Did she tell you about
the theatre and what it meant?


376
00:25:38.494 --> 00:25:40.912
No, I told her. 
I sounded off.

377
00:25:40.996 --> 00:25:43.998
All the religions in the world
rolled into one,


378
00:25:44.083 --> 00:25:46.501
and we're gods and goddesses.

379
00:25:46.627 --> 00:25:51.256
Isn’t it silly? Suddenly I've developed
a big, protective feeling toward her.


380
00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.092
A lamb loose in our big, stone jungle.

381
00:25:59.515 --> 00:26:03.935
-Take care of yourself out there.
-They have the Indians pretty well in hand.


382
00:26:04.019 --> 00:26:05.186
Bill.

383
00:26:05.271 --> 00:26:08.398
-Don't get stuck on some glamour puss.
-I'll try.


384
00:26:08.482 --> 00:26:12.193
You're not much of a bargain. You're
conceited, thoughtless and messy.


385
00:26:12.319 --> 00:26:17.532
-Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
-You're a setup for some young babe.


386
00:26:17.616 --> 00:26:20.118
How childish are you gonna get
before you stop it?


387
00:26:20.202 --> 00:26:22.954
I don't wanna be childish.
I'd settle for a few years.


388
00:26:23.038 --> 00:26:25.206
And cut that out right now.

389
00:26:25.291 --> 00:26:28.376
Am I going to
lose you, Bill? Am I?

390
00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.878
As of this moment, you're six years old.

391
00:26:31.005 --> 00:26:33.715
All ready.

392
00:26:49.565 --> 00:26:51.816
Thanks for your help. Good luck.

393
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.068
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.

394
00:26:54.153 --> 00:26:57.071
-Knit me a muffler?
-Call me when you get in.


395
00:27:12.588 --> 00:27:14.922
Hey, Junior!

396
00:27:15.257 --> 00:27:18.384
Keep your eye on her.
Don't let her get lonely.


397
00:27:18.469 --> 00:27:20.428
She's a loose lamb in a jungle.

398
00:27:20.554 --> 00:27:22.597
Don't worry.

399
00:27:36.278 --> 00:27:41.115
That same night, we sent for Eve's
things, her few pitiful possessions.


400
00:27:41.241 --> 00:27:44.744
She moved into the little guest room
on the top floor.


401
00:27:47.956 --> 00:27:50.500
The next three weeks
were out of a fairy tale,


402
00:27:50.584 --> 00:27:53.044
and I was Cinderella in the last act.

403
00:27:53.128 --> 00:27:58.800
Eve became my sister, lawyer, mother,
friend, psychiatrist and cop.


404
00:28:00.594 --> 00:28:02.637
The honeymoon was on.

405
00:29:08.871 --> 00:29:11.372
One more?

406
00:29:11.457 --> 00:29:13.541
From now on it isn't applause,

407
00:29:13.625 --> 00:29:16.961
just something to do
till the aisles get cleared.


408
00:29:18.797 --> 00:29:20.882
What, again?

409
00:29:23.719 --> 00:29:28.181
I could watch you play that last scene
a thousand times, cry every time.


410
00:29:28.682 --> 00:29:32.059
Performance number 1,000 of this one,
if I play it that long,


411
00:29:32.186 --> 00:29:35.521
will take place
in a well-padded booby hatch.


412
00:29:38.192 --> 00:29:42.570
I must say, you can certainly tell
Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.


413
00:29:42.654 --> 00:29:44.739
You certainly can.

414
00:29:44.865 --> 00:29:48.659
Especially if you're me
between now and tomorrow morning.


415
00:29:48.744 --> 00:29:51.996
You bought the new girdles a size smaller.
I can feel it.


416
00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.582
Something maybe grew a size larger.

417
00:29:54.708 --> 00:29:58.169
You can get into one of those girdles
and act for two and a half hours.


418
00:29:58.253 --> 00:30:01.881
I couldn't get into the girdle
in two and a half hours.


419
00:30:07.721 --> 00:30:11.265
You haven't noticed my latest bit
of interior decorating.


420
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:15.102
But you've done so much.
What's new?


421
00:30:15.187 --> 00:30:17.688
The curtains. I made them myself.

422
00:30:19.775 --> 00:30:22.610
They're lovely. 
Aren't they lovely, Birdie?

423
00:30:22.736 --> 00:30:24.111
Adorable.

424
00:30:24.238 --> 00:30:28.366
We now got everything a dressing room
needs except a basketball hoop.


425
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:30.785
Just because
you can't even work a zipper!


426
00:30:30.911 --> 00:30:34.288
It was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
I appreciate it.


427
00:30:34.414 --> 00:30:37.208
I'll just take this to the wardrobe mistress.

428
00:30:37.292 --> 00:30:39.669
Don't bother.
Mrs. Brown will be along soon.


429
00:30:39.753 --> 00:30:41.629
No trouble at all.

430
00:30:47.427 --> 00:30:50.137
May I be so
bold as to say something?

431
00:30:50.222 --> 00:30:53.975
-Have you ever heard of the word "union"?
-Behind in your dues? How much?


432
00:30:54.059 --> 00:30:57.478
-I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
-Well?


433
00:30:57.604 --> 00:31:00.731
But the wardrobe women have got one
and, next to a tenor,


434
00:31:00.816 --> 00:31:04.402
a wardrobe woman is the
touchiest thing in show business.


435
00:31:04.486 --> 00:31:05.528
Oh, oh.

436
00:31:05.612 --> 00:31:08.990
She's got two things to do:
carry clothes and press 'em wrong.


437
00:31:09.074 --> 00:31:12.326
And don't let anybody try to muscle in.

438
00:31:20.794 --> 00:31:23.254
Eve.

439
00:31:26.008 --> 00:31:29.343
We'd better let Mrs. Brown
pick up the wardrobe.


440
00:31:57.956 --> 00:31:59.040
Hello.

441
00:31:59.124 --> 00:32:01.125
We are ready
with your call to Beverly Hills.


442
00:32:01.209 --> 00:32:06.464
-Call? What call?
-Is this Templeton 89970? Miss Channing?


443
00:32:06.548 --> 00:32:08.799
Yes, it is, but I don't understand.

444
00:32:08.884 --> 00:32:12.094
We are ready with the call you placed
for 12 midnight, California time,


445
00:32:12.179 --> 00:32:13.971
to Mr. Sampson.

446
00:32:14.056 --> 00:32:16.891
-I placed?
-Go ahead, please.


447
00:32:17.017 --> 00:32:20.561
Margo, what a wonderful surprise.

448
00:32:20.687 --> 00:32:23.981
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do.

449
00:32:24.066 --> 00:32:27.652
Bill. Have I gone crazy, Bill?

450
00:32:27.736 --> 00:32:30.404
-You're my girl, aren't you?
-That I am.


451
00:32:30.489 --> 00:32:32.573
Then you're crazy.

452
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:36.911
-When are you coming back?
-I leave in a week.


453
00:32:36.995 --> 00:32:39.747
The picture's wrapped up.
We previewed last night.


454
00:32:39.998 --> 00:32:42.083
Oh, those previews.

455
00:32:42.209 --> 00:32:46.253
Like opening out of town, but terrifying.
There's nothing you can do.


456
00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.506
You're trapped. 
You're in a tin can.

457
00:32:49.007 --> 00:32:54.261
In a tin can, cellophane or wrapped
in a Navajo blanket, I want you home.


458
00:32:54.721 --> 00:32:59.183
-You in a hurry?
-In a big hurry, so be quick about it.


459
00:32:59.893 --> 00:33:02.186
Goodbye, darling. Sleep tight.

460
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.231
Hey, wait a minute.
You haven't even said it yet.


461
00:33:06.108 --> 00:33:10.277
Oh, now, Bill. You know how much I do,
but over a phone...


462
00:33:10.362 --> 00:33:13.447
Now, really. That's kids' stuff.

463
00:33:13.573 --> 00:33:17.284
Kids' stuff or not. It doesn't happen
every day and I wanna hear it.


464
00:33:17.411 --> 00:33:20.454
-And if you won't say it, you can sing it.
-Sing it?


465
00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.457
Sure, like the Western Union boys
used to do.


466
00:33:27.629 --> 00:33:29.755
Bill...

467
00:33:30.298 --> 00:33:32.800
It's your birthday.

468
00:33:32.884 --> 00:33:38.055
And who remembered it?
Who was there on the dot at 12 midnight?


469
00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.057
Happy birthday, darling.

470
00:33:40.142 --> 00:33:43.561
The reading could've been better,
but you said it.


471
00:33:43.645 --> 00:33:45.896
Now, "Many happy returns of the day."

472
00:33:45.981 --> 00:33:48.899
Many happy returns of the day.

473
00:33:49.818 --> 00:33:53.988
-I get a party, don't I?
-Of course. Birthday and coming home.


474
00:33:54.114 --> 00:33:57.992
-Who will I ask?
-I know all about the party. Eve wrote me.


475
00:34:00.162 --> 00:34:02.663
-She did?
-She hasn't missed a week since I left.


476
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:05.499
But you know that.
You probably tell her what to write.


477
00:34:05.584 --> 00:34:08.419
I sent her a list of guests,
so check with her.


478
00:34:08.503 --> 00:34:10.004
Yeah, I will.

479
00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:13.674
-How is Eve? OK?
-OK.


480
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.510
-I love you.
-I'll check with Eve.


481
00:34:16.636 --> 00:34:17.678
Hm?

482
00:34:18.305 --> 00:34:22.099
I love you, too. 
Good night, darling.

483
00:34:22.476 --> 00:34:24.518
See ya.

484
00:35:09.564 --> 00:35:11.649
-Birdie.
-Hm?


485
00:35:12.567 --> 00:35:14.985
You don't like Eve, do you?

486
00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.321
You want an argument or an answer?

487
00:35:17.405 --> 00:35:20.074
-An answer.
-No.


488
00:35:20.158 --> 00:35:22.660
-Why not?
-Now you want an argument.


489
00:35:23.745 --> 00:35:26.914
-She works hard.
-Night and day.


490
00:35:26.998 --> 00:35:31.377
-She's loyal and efficient.
-Like an agent with only one client.


491
00:35:33.213 --> 00:35:35.756
She thinks only of me,

492
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:38.592
doesn't she?

493
00:35:38.718 --> 00:35:42.179
Well, let's say she thinks
only about ya, anyway.


494
00:35:42.264 --> 00:35:45.266
-How do you mean that?
-I'll tell ya how.


495
00:35:46.226 --> 00:35:47.935
Like...

496
00:35:48.019 --> 00:35:50.020
Like she's studying you.

497
00:35:50.105 --> 00:35:53.274
Like you was a play, or a book,
or a set of blueprints.


498
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.609
How you walk, talk, eat, think...

499
00:35:55.694 --> 00:35:58.779
I'm sure that's flattering.
There's nothing wrong with it.


500
00:36:01.283 --> 00:36:05.452
Good morning. Well, what do
you think of my elegant new suit?


501
00:36:05.579 --> 00:36:07.955
It looks much better on you
than it did on me.


502
00:36:08.081 --> 00:36:12.877
I can imagine. All it needed was
a little taking in here and letting out there.


503
00:36:12.961 --> 00:36:14.503
Are you sure you won't want it yourself?

504
00:36:14.588 --> 00:36:18.132
Quite sure.
I find it too seventeenish for me.


505
00:36:18.216 --> 00:36:20.551
Come now,
as though you were an old lady.


506
00:36:20.635 --> 00:36:23.137
I'm on my way. 
Is there anything else?

507
00:36:23.221 --> 00:36:25.639
-That script to take to the Guild.
-I've got it.


508
00:36:25.724 --> 00:36:28.225
And those checks
for the income-tax man.


509
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:30.436
Right here.

510
00:36:30.979 --> 00:36:34.231
It seems I can't think of a thing
you haven't thought of.


511
00:36:34.316 --> 00:36:37.067
That's my job. 
See you at teatime.

512
00:36:39.654 --> 00:36:41.071
Eve?

513
00:36:41.156 --> 00:36:46.785
Did you place a call from me to Bill
for midnight California time?


514
00:36:47.579 --> 00:36:51.081
-Golly, I forgot to tell you!
-Yes, dear, you forgot all about it.


515
00:36:51.166 --> 00:36:54.001
I was sure you'd want to,
being his birthday.


516
00:36:54.085 --> 00:36:58.923
You've been so busy lately. Last night
I meant to tell you before you went out.


517
00:36:59.007 --> 00:37:01.592
I guess I was
asleep when you got home.

518
00:37:01.676 --> 00:37:05.012
Yes, I guess you were.
It was very thoughtful of you, Eve.


519
00:37:05.347 --> 00:37:09.183
Mr. Sampson's birthday,
I couldn't forget that.


520
00:37:09.267 --> 00:37:10.684
You'd never forgive me.

521
00:37:17.025 --> 00:37:20.653
As a matter of fact,
I sent him a telegram myself.


522
00:37:47.555 --> 00:37:52.142
Bill's welcome-home birthday
party, a night to go down in history.


523
00:37:52.227 --> 00:37:56.814
Even before the party started,
I could smell disaster in the air.


524
00:37:56.898 --> 00:38:02.569
I knew it. I sensed it even as I finished
dressing for that blasted party.


525
00:38:03.989 --> 00:38:06.699
-You all put together?
-My back's open.


526
00:38:08.076 --> 00:38:10.744
-Extra help get here?
-There's some characters


527
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:14.748
dressed as maids and butlers.
Did you call the William Morris Agency?


528
00:38:14.833 --> 00:38:18.085
You're not funny. Actors would cost less.
How about the food?


529
00:38:18.211 --> 00:38:20.838
The caterer had to go back
for the hors d'oeuvres.


530
00:38:21.006 --> 00:38:22.172
Voilà!

531
00:38:22.924 --> 00:38:25.759
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot.

532
00:38:25.885 --> 00:38:28.762
There was nothing he didn't know.

533
00:38:33.727 --> 00:38:35.769
There's a message from the bartender.

534
00:38:35.895 --> 00:38:39.523
"Does Miss Channing know that
she ordered domestic gin by mistake?"


535
00:38:39.607 --> 00:38:42.443
The only thing I ordered
by mistake is the guests.


536
00:38:42.527 --> 00:38:45.529
They don't care what they drink
as long as it burns.


537
00:38:45.613 --> 00:38:48.532
-Where's Bill? He's late.
-Late for what?


538
00:38:48.616 --> 00:38:49.908
Don't be dense. The party.

539
00:38:49.993 --> 00:38:52.870
I ain't dense.
He's been here for 20 minutes.


540
00:38:52.954 --> 00:38:56.957
Well, I certainly think it's odd
he hasn't even come up to...


541
00:39:14.559 --> 00:39:17.227
The cameraman said,

542
00:39:17.312 --> 00:39:21.482
"Even DeMille couldn't see anything
looking through the wrong end!" So...


543
00:39:21.608 --> 00:39:24.651
Don't let me kill the point.
Or isn't it a story for grown-ups?


544
00:39:24.778 --> 00:39:27.988
You've heard it. I looked through
the wrong end of the camera.


545
00:39:28.073 --> 00:39:32.159
Remind me to tell you about the time
I looked into the heart of an artichoke.


546
00:39:32.285 --> 00:39:36.747
-I'd like to hear it.
-Some snowy night in front of the fire.


547
00:39:36.831 --> 00:39:39.917
Meanwhile, would you check
about the hors d'oeuvres, Eve?


548
00:39:40.001 --> 00:39:43.337
The caterer forgot them.
The varnish wasn't dry or something.


549
00:39:43.421 --> 00:39:45.506
Of course.

550
00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:58.519
Looks like I'm going
to have a fancy party.

551
00:39:58.645 --> 00:40:02.439
-I thought you were going to be late.
-Well, I'm guest of honor.


552
00:40:02.524 --> 00:40:04.608
I had no idea you were even here.

553
00:40:04.692 --> 00:40:07.861
I ran into Eve
and she told me you were dressing.


554
00:40:07.946 --> 00:40:10.447
That's never stopped you before.

555
00:40:11.866 --> 00:40:15.536
She wanted to know about Hollywood.
She seemed so interested...


556
00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:19.706
-She's a girl of so many interests.
-It's a pretty rare quality these days.


557
00:40:19.791 --> 00:40:23.210
-A girl of so many rare qualities.
-So she seems.


558
00:40:23.336 --> 00:40:25.629
So you've pointed out so often.

559
00:40:25.713 --> 00:40:27.714
So many qualities so often.

560
00:40:27.841 --> 00:40:32.136
Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth
and affection, and so young.


561
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.304
So young and so fair.

562
00:40:36.224 --> 00:40:38.475
I can't believe you're making this up.

563
00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.728
It sounds like something
out of an old Clyde Fitch play.


564
00:40:41.813 --> 00:40:45.649
Clyde Fitch, though you may not think so,
was well before my time.


565
00:40:45.733 --> 00:40:48.735
I always deny that
you were in Our American Cousin


566
00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:50.070
the night Lincoln was shot.

567
00:40:50.155 --> 00:40:53.157
-I don't think that's funny.
-Of course it is.


568
00:40:53.241 --> 00:40:55.826
This is all too laughable
to be anything else.


569
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:58.328
You know what I feel
about your age obsession.


570
00:40:58.413 --> 00:41:01.206
And this getting into a jealous froth

571
00:41:01.291 --> 00:41:03.250
because I spent ten minutes
with a stage-struck kid.


572
00:41:03.334 --> 00:41:05.752
-20!
-30 minutes, 40 minutes. What of it?


573
00:41:05.837 --> 00:41:08.338
Stage-struck.
She's a young lady of qualities.


574
00:41:08.423 --> 00:41:12.426
And I'm fed up with both
the young lady and her qualities.


575
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:15.929
Studying me as if I were a play
or a blueprint.


576
00:41:16.014 --> 00:41:19.016
How I walk, talk, think, act, sleep.

577
00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:22.936
How can you take offense at a kid
trying to be like her ideal?


578
00:41:23.062 --> 00:41:25.564
Stop calling her a kid.

579
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:30.861
As it happens, there are
particular aspects of my life


580
00:41:30.945 --> 00:41:35.199
to which I would like to maintain
sole and exclusive rights and privileges.


581
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:38.535
-For instance, what?
-For instance, you.


582
00:41:40.872 --> 00:41:44.708
This is my cue to take you
in my arms and reassure you.


583
00:41:44.792 --> 00:41:46.627
But I'm not going to. I'm too mad.

584
00:41:46.753 --> 00:41:48.295
-Guilty!
-Mad!


585
00:41:48.379 --> 00:41:51.089
There are certain characteristics
for which you are famous,


586
00:41:51.174 --> 00:41:52.549
on stage and off.

587
00:41:52.634 --> 00:41:57.137
I love you for some and in spite of others.
I haven't let those become too important.


588
00:41:57.222 --> 00:42:01.892
They're part of your equipment for getting
along in what is called "our environment".


589
00:42:01.976 --> 00:42:04.561
You have to keep your teeth sharp,
all right.


590
00:42:04.646 --> 00:42:07.564
But I will not have you
sharpen them on me, or on Eve.


591
00:42:07.649 --> 00:42:12.236
-What about her teeth? Her fangs?
-She hasn't cut them yet and you know it!


592
00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:15.405
So when you start judging
an idealistic, dreamy-eyed kid


593
00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:19.534
by the bar-room, Benzedrine standards
of this megalomaniac society,


594
00:42:19.619 --> 00:42:20.744
I won't have it!

595
00:42:20.828 --> 00:42:24.414
Eve Harrington has never by word,
look, thought or suggestion


596
00:42:24.499 --> 00:42:29.086
indicated anything to me but adoration
for you and happiness at our being in love.


597
00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:30.254
To intimate anything else

598
00:42:30.338 --> 00:42:34.049
spells a paranoiac insecurity
that you should be ashamed of.


599
00:42:34.175 --> 00:42:36.468
Cut. Print it.
What happens in the next reel?


600
00:42:36.552 --> 00:42:39.179
Do I get dragged
off to the snake pits?

601
00:42:39.264 --> 00:42:41.348
Miss Channing?

602
00:42:43.685 --> 00:42:47.688
The hors d'oeuvres are here.
Is there anything else I can do?


603
00:42:51.359 --> 00:42:55.112
Thank you, Eve. 
I'd like a martini, very dry.

604
00:42:55.196 --> 00:42:57.322
I'll get it.

605
00:42:59.659 --> 00:43:01.868
-What'll you have?
-A milk shake?


606
00:43:02.996 --> 00:43:05.497
A martini, very dry, please.

607
00:43:09.836 --> 00:43:12.796
-The party's on the first floor.
-Hi, Bill.


608
00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.215
-Hello, Mrs. Richards.
-How are you, dear?


609
00:43:15.341 --> 00:43:18.135
Good evening, Mr. Richards. Mr. Fabian.

610
00:43:18.219 --> 00:43:20.554
-May I have your coat?
-I'll take it up.


611
00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.723
-Please.
-Thank you.


612
00:43:23.308 --> 00:43:25.392
-Hi.
-Hi, Margo.


613
00:43:25.893 --> 00:43:28.979
-The house looks lovely.
-I like that girl.


614
00:43:29.063 --> 00:43:31.231
That quality of quiet graciousness.

615
00:43:31.316 --> 00:43:34.151
Among so many quiet qualities.

616
00:43:34.235 --> 00:43:36.153
Shall we?

617
00:43:36.529 --> 00:43:41.408
-It's made me so happy your taking Eve in.
-I'm so happy you're happy.


618
00:43:41.534 --> 00:43:44.995
You haven't been running
a settlement house exactly.


619
00:43:45.079 --> 00:43:46.663
The kid has earned her way.

620
00:43:46.748 --> 00:43:49.416
You had a mixed-up inventory
when she took over.


621
00:43:49.542 --> 00:43:51.835
Merchandise laying all over the shop.

622
00:43:51.919 --> 00:43:55.839
-You mixed Margo up with a five-and-ten.
-Make it Bergdorf Goodman.


623
00:43:55.923 --> 00:43:59.760
Everything on its proper shelf, eh, Max?
All done up in little ribbons.


624
00:43:59.886 --> 00:44:02.846
I could die right now
and nobody'd be confused.


625
00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:05.182
-How about you, Max?
-How about me what?


626
00:44:05.266 --> 00:44:08.435
Suppose you dropped dead.
What about your inventory?


627
00:44:08.519 --> 00:44:12.773
I ain't going to drop dead.
Not with the heat.


628
00:44:12.857 --> 00:44:15.609
This is the most ghoulish conversation.

629
00:44:15.735 --> 00:44:17.861
-Thank you.
-Nothing.


630
00:44:17.945 --> 00:44:19.946
Max! Mon vieux!

631
00:44:20.031 --> 00:44:22.449
Fife!

632
00:44:22.533 --> 00:44:26.953
"The kid" will be down in a minute, unless
you'd like to take her drink up to her.


633
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.874
I can get a fresh one...
Karen, you're a Gibson girl.


634
00:44:31.125 --> 00:44:33.794
The general atmosphere
is very Macbethish.


635
00:44:33.878 --> 00:44:36.963
-What has or is about to happen?
-What is he talking about?


636
00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:40.550
-Macbeth.
-We've seen you like this before.


637
00:44:40.635 --> 00:44:43.136
Is it over or is it just beginning?

638
00:44:52.814 --> 00:44:56.942
Fasten your seat belts.
It's going to be a bumpy night.


639
00:44:58.778 --> 00:45:01.154
-Margo, darling!
-How are you?


640
00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:04.032
Mademoiselle, je vous remercie
pour l'invitation.


641
00:45:04.117 --> 00:45:07.327
Enchantée to you too.

642
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:11.832
I remember, Addison, crossing you off
my guest list. What are you doing here?


643
00:45:11.916 --> 00:45:16.253
Dear Margo, you were an unforgettable
Peter Pan. You must play it again soon.


644
00:45:16.337 --> 00:45:18.839
-Remember Miss Casswell?
-I do not. How do you do?


645
00:45:18.965 --> 00:45:22.092
-We've never met. Maybe that's why.
-She is an actress.


646
00:45:22.176 --> 00:45:25.512
A graduate of the Copacabana
School of Dramatic Art.


647
00:45:26.848 --> 00:45:28.932
Ah... Eve.

648
00:45:29.016 --> 00:45:32.436
-Good evening, Mr. DeWitt.
-I had no idea you knew each other.


649
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.272
This must be, at long last,
our formal introduction.


650
00:45:35.356 --> 00:45:40.193
-Until now, we've only met in passing.
-That's how you met me. In passing.


651
00:45:40.319 --> 00:45:42.779
Eve, this is an old friend
of Mr. DeWitt's mother.


652
00:45:42.864 --> 00:45:46.283
-Miss Casswell, Miss Harrington.
-How do you do?


653
00:45:46.367 --> 00:45:49.286
I've been wanting you
to meet Eve for the longest time.


654
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:52.456
Your timidity must have
kept you from mentioning it.


655
00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:55.959
-You know of her interest in the theatre?
-We have that in common.


656
00:45:56.043 --> 00:45:57.961
Then you two must have a long talk.

657
00:45:58.045 --> 00:46:01.047
I'm afraid Mr. DeWitt would find me
boring before too long.


658
00:46:01.174 --> 00:46:04.634
You won't bore him, honey.
You won't even get a chance to talk.


659
00:46:04.719 --> 00:46:06.845
Claudia, come here.

660
00:46:08.806 --> 00:46:11.808
You see that man?
That's Max Fabian, the producer.


661
00:46:11.893 --> 00:46:14.227
Now, go and do yourself some good.

662
00:46:14.312 --> 00:46:17.063
Why do they always look
like unhappy rabbits?


663
00:46:17.148 --> 00:46:20.901
Cos that's what they are.
Now go and make him happier.


664
00:46:23.571 --> 00:46:27.991
Now, don't worry about your little charge.
She'll be in safe hands.


665
00:46:38.753 --> 00:46:40.879
Amen!

666
00:47:23.464 --> 00:47:27.050
-Liebestraum.
-I just played it.


667
00:47:27.134 --> 00:47:30.387
-Play it again.
-But that was the fourth straight time.


668
00:47:30.471 --> 00:47:32.764
Then this will be five.

669
00:47:35.601 --> 00:47:40.146
Many of your guests are wondering when
they may be permitted to view the body.


670
00:47:40.231 --> 00:47:44.484
-Where has it been laid out?
-It hasn't been laid out.


671
00:47:44.569 --> 00:47:47.821
We haven't finished with the embalming.

672
00:47:47.905 --> 00:47:50.907
As a matter of
fact, you're looking at it.

673
00:47:50.992 --> 00:47:53.827
The remains of Margo Channing

674
00:47:54.745 --> 00:47:56.830
sitting up.

675
00:47:56.914 --> 00:48:00.417
It is my last wish
to be buried sitting up.

676
00:48:00.501 --> 00:48:03.003
Wouldn't you feel more natural
taking a bow?


677
00:48:03.087 --> 00:48:07.424
You know nothing about feelings,
natural or unnatural.


678
00:48:07.508 --> 00:48:11.177
Your guests were also wondering
whether the music couldn't be


679
00:48:11.262 --> 00:48:14.598
a shade more on the,
shall we say, happier side?


680
00:48:14.682 --> 00:48:16.933
If my guests do not like it here,

681
00:48:17.018 --> 00:48:20.270
I suggest they accompany you
to the nursery


682
00:48:20.354 --> 00:48:24.190
where I'm sure
you will all feel more at home.


683
00:48:24.317 --> 00:48:29.279
Margo, you by any chance haven't got
any bicarbonate of soda in the house?


684
00:48:29.363 --> 00:48:32.699
Poor Max. Heartburn?

685
00:48:33.868 --> 00:48:36.202
It's that Miss Casswell.

686
00:48:36.287 --> 00:48:39.456
I don't see why she hasn't
given Addison heartburn.


687
00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:40.790
No heart to burn.

688
00:48:40.875 --> 00:48:45.211
Everybody has a heart,
except some people.


689
00:48:46.297 --> 00:48:48.548
Of course I've got bicarb.

690
00:48:48.633 --> 00:48:51.134
I've got a box in the pantry.

691
00:48:51.218 --> 00:48:54.804
We'll put your name on it. "Max Fabian."

692
00:48:54.889 --> 00:48:59.309
It will stay there always, just for you.

693
00:49:00.394 --> 00:49:03.813
Let the rest of the world
beat their brains out for a buck.


694
00:49:03.898 --> 00:49:05.982
It's friends that count.

695
00:49:06.067 --> 00:49:10.904
-And I have friends.
-I love you, Max. I really mean it.


696
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:13.239
I love you.

697
00:49:13.366 --> 00:49:15.659
Come to the pantry.

698
00:49:16.327 --> 00:49:19.412
She loves me like a father.
Also, she's loaded.


699
00:49:35.054 --> 00:49:37.097
There you are, Maxie dear.

700
00:49:37.223 --> 00:49:40.350
One good burp
and you'll be rid of that Miss Casswell.


701
00:49:40.434 --> 00:49:44.020
The situation I'm in ain't the kind
you can belch your way out of.


702
00:49:44.105 --> 00:49:47.524
-I made a promise.
-To Miss Casswell? What?


703
00:49:47.608 --> 00:49:50.276
For an audition
for this part we are replacing.


704
00:49:50.403 --> 00:49:52.445
What's her name? Your sister?

705
00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:54.864
-One?
-No, two, please.


706
00:49:54.949 --> 00:49:57.283
If she can act,
she might not be bad.

707
00:49:57.410 --> 00:50:00.537
She looks like she might
burn down a plantation.


708
00:50:00.621 --> 00:50:03.456
Right now, I feel like
there is one burning in me.


709
00:50:03.541 --> 00:50:06.459
-When's the audition?
-A couple of weeks.


710
00:50:06.585 --> 00:50:10.296
Tell you what. 
Why don't I read with her?

711
00:50:10.381 --> 00:50:14.134
-Would you?
-Anything to help you out, Max.


712
00:50:14.218 --> 00:50:17.220
Now that's cooperation. 
I appreciate it.

713
00:50:17.304 --> 00:50:21.141
Not at all. And now you
can do me a great favor.


714
00:50:21.225 --> 00:50:23.309
Just name it.

715
00:50:23.436 --> 00:50:26.771
Give Eve Harrington a job in your office.

716
00:50:29.525 --> 00:50:32.986
You get quick action, don't you?

717
00:50:33.112 --> 00:50:35.989
I wouldn't think of taking
that girl away from you.


718
00:50:36.115 --> 00:50:38.575
You said yourself
my inventory was in shape,


719
00:50:38.659 --> 00:50:40.827
all my merchandise put away.

720
00:50:40.953 --> 00:50:44.497
To keep her here with nothing to do,
I'd be standing in her way.


721
00:50:44.623 --> 00:50:47.500
-And you need her, Max.
-What will she do?


722
00:50:47.626 --> 00:50:50.420
She'd be a great help. 
She'd read scripts,

723
00:50:50.504 --> 00:50:55.008
interview people you have to see,
get rid of those you don't have to.


724
00:50:55.134 --> 00:50:57.677
You'd be a man of leisure, Maxie.

725
00:50:57.803 --> 00:51:00.180
-Well...
-Think of your health.


726
00:51:00.264 --> 00:51:03.767
More time to relax
in the fresh air at a racetrack.


727
00:51:03.851 --> 00:51:07.437
-I don't think it's such a good idea.
-Promise?


728
00:51:07.521 --> 00:51:09.647
-Promise.
-That's my Max.


729
00:51:11.358 --> 00:51:13.109
Oh, there you both are.

730
00:51:13.194 --> 00:51:15.445
Max, Karen's decided it's time to go.

731
00:51:15.529 --> 00:51:18.114
-Where is she now?
-Up in your room.


732
00:51:18.199 --> 00:51:21.534
If you'll excuse me,
I'll go and tell Miss Casswell.


733
00:51:25.372 --> 00:51:27.874
-Who's left out there?
-Too many.


734
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.461
And, besides, you got a new guest.
A movie star from Hollywood.


735
00:51:31.545 --> 00:51:36.299
Shucks! And I sent
my autograph book to the cleaners.


736
00:51:40.304 --> 00:51:43.139
You disapprove of me
when I'm like this, don't you?


737
00:51:43.224 --> 00:51:47.894
Not exactly. Sometimes, though,
I wish I understood you better.


738
00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.522
-When you do, let me in on it.
-I will.


739
00:51:52.525 --> 00:51:56.861
-How's the new one coming?
-The play? Oh, all right, I guess.


740
00:51:57.863 --> 00:52:01.241
Cora. Still a girl of 20?

741
00:52:01.367 --> 00:52:03.409
20-ish. It's not important.

742
00:52:03.536 --> 00:52:06.329
Don't you think it's about time
it became important?


743
00:52:06.413 --> 00:52:09.582
-How do you mean?
-Don't be evasive.


744
00:52:09.667 --> 00:52:12.085
Margo, you haven't got any age.

745
00:52:12.211 --> 00:52:15.839
Miss Channing is ageless.
Spoken like a press agent.


746
00:52:15.923 --> 00:52:18.758
I know what I'm talking about.
They're my plays.


747
00:52:18.884 --> 00:52:20.927
Spoken like an author.

748
00:52:21.887 --> 00:52:25.181
Lloyd, I'm not 20-ish. 
I'm not 30-ish.

749
00:52:25.266 --> 00:52:28.101
Three months ago I was 40 years old.

750
00:52:28.185 --> 00:52:30.770
40! Four-0.

751
00:52:33.524 --> 00:52:35.316
That slipped out.

752
00:52:35.401 --> 00:52:38.444
I hadn't quite made up my mind
to admit it.


753
00:52:40.197 --> 00:52:44.117
Now I suddenly feel as if
I've taken all my clothes off.


754
00:52:47.121 --> 00:52:50.123
To thousands of people
you're as young as you want.


755
00:52:50.207 --> 00:52:52.959
As young as they want, you mean.

756
00:52:53.043 --> 00:52:56.880
I'm not interested whether thousands
of people think I'm six or 600.


757
00:52:56.964 --> 00:52:59.465
Just one person, isn't that so?

758
00:53:02.428 --> 00:53:04.721
You know what this is all about.

759
00:53:04.805 --> 00:53:07.307
It has little to do with
whether you should play Cora.


760
00:53:07.391 --> 00:53:10.476
It has everything to do with
you having a fight with Bill.


761
00:53:10.603 --> 00:53:13.646
Bill's 32. He looks 32.

762
00:53:13.772 --> 00:53:18.234
He looked it five years ago.
He'll look it 20 years from now.


763
00:53:18.319 --> 00:53:20.445
I hate men.

764
00:53:23.115 --> 00:53:25.909
Don't worry, Lloyd. 
I'll play your play.

765
00:53:25.993 --> 00:53:30.163
I'll wear rompers and come in
rolling a hoop, if you like.


766
00:53:34.168 --> 00:53:37.962
Who'd show up at this hour?
It's time people went home.


767
00:53:40.257 --> 00:53:42.342
Hold that coat up.

768
00:53:45.346 --> 00:53:48.681
-Whose is it?
-Some Hollywood movie star.


769
00:53:48.766 --> 00:53:52.101
-Her plane got in late.
-Discouraging, isn't it?


770
00:53:52.186 --> 00:53:55.605
Women with furs like that
where it never even gets cold.


771
00:53:55.689 --> 00:53:57.774
Hollywood.

772
00:54:00.277 --> 00:54:03.863
Tell me, Eve. How are things
going with you? Happy?


773
00:54:03.948 --> 00:54:06.199
There should be a new word for happiness.

774
00:54:06.283 --> 00:54:10.036
Being here with Miss Channing
has been a... I just can't say.


775
00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:13.539
She's been so wonderful,
done so much for me.


776
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.669
Lloyd says Margo compensates for
underplaying on stage


777
00:54:17.753 --> 00:54:20.713
by overplaying reality.

778
00:54:21.715 --> 00:54:25.718
Next to that sable, my new mink
seems like an old bed jacket.


779
00:54:25.844 --> 00:54:31.224
You've done your share, Eve. You've
worked wonders with Margo. Good night.


780
00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:34.143
-Mrs. Richards?
-Karen.


781
00:54:34.228 --> 00:54:36.229
Karen.

782
00:54:36.313 --> 00:54:39.899
Isn’t it awful? I'm about
to ask you for another favor,


783
00:54:40.025 --> 00:54:41.985
after all you've done already.

784
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:43.987
Nobody's done so much.

785
00:54:44.071 --> 00:54:47.740
Stop thinking of yourself
as one of the hundred neediest cases.


786
00:54:47.866 --> 00:54:51.995
-What is it?
-Miss Channing's affairs are in good shape,


787
00:54:52.079 --> 00:54:55.164
so there isn't enough
to keep me as busy as I should be.


788
00:54:55.249 --> 00:54:58.584
Not that I'd consider anything
that would take me away from her.


789
00:54:58.711 --> 00:55:02.255
But the other day
when Mr. Fabian told Miss Channing


790
00:55:02.381 --> 00:55:06.926
that her understudy was going to have
a baby and they'd have to replace her...


791
00:55:07.011 --> 00:55:11.764
-You wanna be Margo's new understudy?
-I don't let myself think about it even.


792
00:55:11.849 --> 00:55:15.435
But I do know the part so well,
and every bit of the staging,


793
00:55:15.519 --> 00:55:18.438
there'd be no need to
break in a new girl.

794
00:55:19.565 --> 00:55:22.275
Suppose I had to go on one night

795
00:55:22.359 --> 00:55:25.611
to an audience that came
to see Margo Channing.


796
00:55:25.738 --> 00:55:29.282
-Oh, no, I couldn't possibly!
-I wouldn't worry too much about that.


797
00:55:29.366 --> 00:55:34.954
Margo just doesn't miss performances.
If she can walk, crawl or roll, she plays.


798
00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:39.542
-The show must go on.
-No, dear. Margo must go on.


799
00:55:39.626 --> 00:55:42.795
I don't see any reason
why you shouldn't be her understudy.


800
00:55:42.921 --> 00:55:46.466
-You think Miss Channing would approve?
-I think she'd cheer.


801
00:55:46.592 --> 00:55:50.928
-But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson?
-They'll do as they're told.


802
00:55:51.764 --> 00:55:55.058
Then would you speak
to Mr. Fabian about it?


803
00:55:55.142 --> 00:55:57.935
-Of course.
-You won't forget?


804
00:55:58.228 --> 00:56:00.313
I won't forget.

805
00:56:02.649 --> 00:56:06.486
I seem to be forever
thanking you for something, don't I?


806
00:56:14.495 --> 00:56:17.413
The bed looks like a dead animal act.

807
00:56:17.498 --> 00:56:21.000
-Which one is sable?
-But she just got here.


808
00:56:21.085 --> 00:56:24.670
Well, she's on her way
with half the men in the joint.


809
00:56:24.755 --> 00:56:28.341
-It's only a fur coat.
-What do you expect? Live sable?


810
00:56:28.467 --> 00:56:32.470
Diamond collar, gold sleeves.
You know, picture people.


811
00:56:34.098 --> 00:56:37.433
Elder statesmen
of the theatre or cinema


812
00:56:37.518 --> 00:56:42.021
assure the public that actors
and actresses are just plain folks,


813
00:56:42.147 --> 00:56:45.691
ignoring the fact that their greatest
attraction to the public


814
00:56:45.818 --> 00:56:49.445
is their complete lack of resemblance
to normal human beings.


815
00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:52.949
Now there's something
a girl could make sacrifices for.


816
00:56:53.033 --> 00:56:55.535
-And probably has.
-Sable.


817
00:56:55.661 --> 00:56:59.122
-Sable? Did she say sable or Gable?
-Either one.


818
00:56:59.206 --> 00:57:02.375
We all have abnormality in common.

819
00:57:02.501 --> 00:57:06.295
We're a breed apart from the rest
of humanity, we theatre folk.


820
00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:09.632
We are the original
displaced personalities.


821
00:57:09.716 --> 00:57:13.553
You won't have to read his column
tomorrow, Eve. You just heard it.


822
00:57:13.679 --> 00:57:17.974
-I don't agree, Addison.
-That's your particular abnormality.


823
00:57:18.058 --> 00:57:20.810
I admit there's a screwball
element in the theatre.


824
00:57:20.894 --> 00:57:24.981
It sticks out, it's got spotlights
on it and a brass band.


825
00:57:25.065 --> 00:57:30.236
But it isn't basic. It isn't standard.
If it were, the theatre couldn't survive.


826
00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:32.280
Oh, waiter.

827
00:57:32.364 --> 00:57:34.740
That isn't a waiter, my dear.
That's a butler.


828
00:57:34.825 --> 00:57:37.243
Well, I can't yell out "butler", can I?

829
00:57:37.327 --> 00:57:39.912
Maybe somebody's name is Butler.

830
00:57:39.997 --> 00:57:43.583
You have a point.
An idiotic one, but a point.


831
00:57:43.709 --> 00:57:47.670
I don't wanna make trouble.
All I want is a drink.


832
00:57:47.754 --> 00:57:51.549
-Leave it to me. I'll get you one.
-Thank you, Mr. Fabian.


833
00:57:52.342 --> 00:57:57.054
Well done. I can see your career
rising in the east like the sun.


834
00:57:59.266 --> 00:58:03.603
-You were saying?
-The theatre is nine-tenths hard work.


835
00:58:04.062 --> 00:58:08.441
Work done the hard way, by sweat,
application and craftsmanship.


836
00:58:08.775 --> 00:58:12.278
To be a good actor or actress,
or anything in the theatre,


837
00:58:12.362 --> 00:58:15.198
means wanting to be that
more than anything else.


838
00:58:15.282 --> 00:58:17.533
Yes. Yes, it does.

839
00:58:17.618 --> 00:58:21.370
It means a concentration
of desire or ambition and sacrifice


840
00:58:21.455 --> 00:58:23.789
such as no other profession demands.

841
00:58:23.874 --> 00:58:27.710
And the man or woman who accepts
those terms can't be ordinary,


842
00:58:27.794 --> 00:58:29.962
can't be just someone.

843
00:58:30.088 --> 00:58:33.049
To give so much
for almost always so little.


844
00:58:33.133 --> 00:58:35.384
"So little?"

845
00:58:35.469 --> 00:58:37.637
"So little," did you say?

846
00:58:38.805 --> 00:58:42.308
Why, if there's nothing else,
there's applause.


847
00:58:42.392 --> 00:58:45.645
I've listened backstage to people applaud.

848
00:58:45.771 --> 00:58:47.647
It's like...

849
00:58:47.773 --> 00:58:52.652
Like waves of love coming over
the footlights and wrapping you up.


850
00:58:52.736 --> 00:58:58.157
Imagine, to know every night
that different hundreds of people love you.


851
00:58:58.242 --> 00:59:02.411
They smile, their eyes shine,
you've pleased them.


852
00:59:02.496 --> 00:59:05.665
They want you. You belong.

853
00:59:07.167 --> 00:59:10.169
Just that alone is worth anything.

854
00:59:24.017 --> 00:59:28.688
Don't get up. And please stop acting
as if I were the Queen Mother.


855
00:59:28.772 --> 00:59:31.691
-I'm sorry, I didn't...
-Outside of a beehive, Margo,


856
00:59:31.817 --> 00:59:34.944
your behavior
is hardly queenly or motherly.


857
00:59:35.028 --> 00:59:37.113
You're in a beehive, pal.

858
00:59:37.197 --> 00:59:41.867
We're all busy little bees, full of stings,
making honey day and night.


859
00:59:41.952 --> 00:59:44.036
-Aren't we, honey?
-Margo, really.


860
00:59:44.371 --> 00:59:47.039
Please don't play governess, Karen.

861
00:59:47.124 --> 00:59:50.626
I haven't your unyielding good taste.

862
00:59:50.711 --> 00:59:55.381
I wish I could have gone to Radcliffe, too,
but Father wouldn't hear of it.


863
00:59:55.465 --> 00:59:58.217
He needed help behind a notions counter.

864
00:59:58.302 --> 01:00:02.388
I'm being rude now, aren't I?
Or should I say, ain't I?


865
01:00:02.723 --> 01:00:06.475
You're maudlin and full of self-pity.
You're magnificent.


866
01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.978
How about calling it a night?

867
01:00:09.062 --> 01:00:11.647
And you pose as a playwright.

868
01:00:11.732 --> 01:00:16.402
A situation pregnant with possibilities,
and all you can think of is "go to sleep."


869
01:00:16.737 --> 01:00:19.822
-It's a good thought.
-It won't play.


870
01:00:20.574 --> 01:00:24.827
As a nonprofessional,
I think it's an excellent idea. Excuse me.


871
01:00:25.579 --> 01:00:28.664
Undramatic, perhaps, but practical.

872
01:00:28.749 --> 01:00:31.584
-Happy little housewife.
-Cut it out.


873
01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:36.589
This is my house, not a theatre.
In my house you're a guest, not a director.


874
01:00:36.715 --> 01:00:40.509
Then stop being a star and treating
your guests as your supporting cast.


875
01:00:40.594 --> 01:00:43.262
-Let's not get into a big hassle.
-It's time we did.


876
01:00:43.388 --> 01:00:47.516
Margo has to realize what's attractive
on stage need not be attractive off.


877
01:00:47.601 --> 01:00:50.102
All right!

878
01:00:50.228 --> 01:00:52.355
I'm going to bed.

879
01:00:59.529 --> 01:01:04.116
You be host. It's your party.
Happy birthday. Welcome home.


880
01:01:04.201 --> 01:01:06.786
And we who are
about to die salute you.

881
01:01:06.912 --> 01:01:08.954
Need any help?

882
01:01:14.461 --> 01:01:18.422
To put me to bed?
Take my clothes off, hold my head?


883
01:01:19.299 --> 01:01:22.885
Tuck me in, turn out the lights
and tiptoe out?


884
01:01:24.596 --> 01:01:26.972
Eve would, wouldn't you, Eve?

885
01:01:27.099 --> 01:01:29.725
-If you'd like.
-I wouldn't like.


886
01:01:36.942 --> 01:01:39.819
-Oh, I forgot I had it.
-I didn't.


887
01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:50.663
Too bad. We're gonna miss the third act.

888
01:01:50.747 --> 01:01:53.249
They're gonna play it offstage.

889
01:01:56.253 --> 01:01:58.754
-Coming, Max?
-In a minute.


890
01:02:01.842 --> 01:02:06.178
Eve, you mustn't mind Margo
too much, even if I do.


891
01:02:06.304 --> 01:02:09.682
There must be some reason,
something I've done without knowing.


892
01:02:09.766 --> 01:02:13.686
The reason is Margo and don't try
to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.


893
01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:16.272
But if I thought I'd offended her,
of all people...


894
01:02:16.356 --> 01:02:19.859
Eve... I'm fond of Margo, too.

895
01:02:19.943 --> 01:02:22.069
But I know Margo.
And every now and then,


896
01:02:22.154 --> 01:02:27.283
there is nothing I wanna do so much
as kick her right square in the pants.


897
01:02:27.367 --> 01:02:29.952
Well, if she has to pick on someone,

898
01:02:30.036 --> 01:02:32.538
I'd just as soon it was me.

899
01:02:35.542 --> 01:02:37.793
-Max is gonna drop us.
-Good night.


900
01:02:37.878 --> 01:02:40.045
-Good night.
-Good night.


901
01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:44.967
Mrs. Richards? You won't forget, will you?
What we talked about before?


902
01:02:45.051 --> 01:02:47.136
No, Eve. I won't forget.

903
01:03:13.663 --> 01:03:15.581
Why so remote, Addison?

904
01:03:15.707 --> 01:03:19.251
You should be at the side of
your protégée, lending her moral support.


905
01:03:19.377 --> 01:03:23.422
Miss Casswell is where I can
lend no support, moral or otherwise.


906
01:03:23.548 --> 01:03:25.758
In the ladies' shall we say "lounge"?

907
01:03:25.842 --> 01:03:28.177
Being violently ill to her tummy.

908
01:03:28.261 --> 01:03:30.679
It's good luck before an audition.

909
01:03:30.764 --> 01:03:33.933
Miss Casswell got lucky too late.
The audition is over.


910
01:03:34.017 --> 01:03:37.770
It can't be. I came here to read
with Miss Casswell. I promised Max.


911
01:03:37.854 --> 01:03:40.356
The audition was at 2.30.
It's now nearly four.


912
01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:44.193
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch.
I never have, you know.


913
01:03:44.277 --> 01:03:46.612
Who read with Miss Casswell?

914
01:03:46.696 --> 01:03:49.281
-Bill? Lloyd?
-No.


915
01:03:49.407 --> 01:03:53.202
-Well, it can't have been Max. Who?
-Naturally, your understudy.


916
01:03:53.286 --> 01:03:56.872
It's unnatural to allow a girl
in an advanced state of pregnancy...


917
01:03:56.957 --> 01:04:01.877
I refer to your new and unpregnant
understudy, Miss Eve Harrington.


918
01:04:01.962 --> 01:04:04.630
Eve? My understudy?

919
01:04:04.756 --> 01:04:08.467
-Didn't you know?
-Of course I knew.


920
01:04:08.593 --> 01:04:10.636
It just slipped your mind?

921
01:04:14.432 --> 01:04:17.059
How was Miss Casswell?

922
01:04:17.644 --> 01:04:19.895
Frankly, I don't remember.

923
01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:22.565
-Just slipped your mind?
-Completely.


924
01:04:22.649 --> 01:04:25.985
Nor can anyone else present
tell you how Miss Casswell read,


925
01:04:26.111 --> 01:04:29.071
or whether Miss Casswell read
or rode a pogo stick.


926
01:04:29.155 --> 01:04:31.407
Was she that bad?

927
01:04:32.075 --> 01:04:36.078
Margo, I have lived in the theatre
as a Trappist monk lives in his faith.


928
01:04:36.162 --> 01:04:38.914
I have no other world, no other life.

929
01:04:38.999 --> 01:04:42.084
Once in a great while,
I experience that moment of revelation


930
01:04:42.168 --> 01:04:45.254
for which all true believers
wait and pray. You were one.


931
01:04:45.338 --> 01:04:51.176
Jeanne Eagels another, Paula Wessely,
Hayes. There are others, three or four.


932
01:04:51.303 --> 01:04:53.596
Eve Harrington will be among them.

933
01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.764
I take it she read well.

934
01:04:55.849 --> 01:04:58.267
It wasn't a reading, it was a performance.

935
01:04:58.351 --> 01:05:01.937
Brilliant, vivid,
something made of music and fire.


936
01:05:02.022 --> 01:05:04.189
How nice.

937
01:05:04.274 --> 01:05:07.109
In time, she'll be what you are.

938
01:05:07.193 --> 01:05:09.695
A mass of music and fire.

939
01:05:10.447 --> 01:05:13.991
That's me.
An old kazoo with some sparklers.


940
01:05:16.453 --> 01:05:20.039
Tell me, was Bill swept away, too?

941
01:05:20.165 --> 01:05:22.666
Or were you
too full of revelation to notice?


942
01:05:22.751 --> 01:05:24.460
Bill didn't say.

943
01:05:24.544 --> 01:05:27.129
But Lloyd listened to his play

944
01:05:27.213 --> 01:05:29.548
as if it had been written by someone else,
he said.


945
01:05:29.633 --> 01:05:32.885
It sounded so fresh,
so new, so full of meaning.


946
01:05:33.553 --> 01:05:37.890
How nice for Lloyd. How nice for Eve.
How nice for everybody.


947
01:05:38.516 --> 01:05:42.645
Eve was incredibly modest.
She insisted that no credit was due her.


948
01:05:42.729 --> 01:05:46.982
That Lloyd felt as he did because she read
his lines exactly as he'd written them.


949
01:05:47.067 --> 01:05:50.319
The implication being
that I did not read them as written?


950
01:05:50.403 --> 01:05:54.907
Neither your name nor your performance
entered the conversation.


951
01:05:59.871 --> 01:06:03.540
Ah! Feeling better, my dear?

952
01:06:05.585 --> 01:06:10.005
Like I just swam the English Channel.
Now what?


953
01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:14.259
Your next move, it seems to me,
should be towards television.


954
01:06:17.764 --> 01:06:21.600
Tell me this.
Do they have auditions for television?


955
01:06:21.685 --> 01:06:25.688
That's all television is, my dear.
Nothing but auditions.


956
01:06:30.443 --> 01:06:32.569
Oh, Margo, darling.

957
01:06:38.118 --> 01:06:39.159
Mm-hm!

958
01:06:43.915 --> 01:06:47.876
Terribly sorry I was late.
Lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab.


959
01:06:47.961 --> 01:06:51.296
-Where's Miss Casswell? Oh, hello, Eve.
-Hello, Miss Channing.


960
01:06:51.423 --> 01:06:54.049
How are you making out
in Mr. Fabian's office?


961
01:06:54.134 --> 01:06:57.094
Now, Max, I don't want you
working this child too hard


962
01:06:57.178 --> 01:06:58.721
just because you promised.

963
01:06:58.805 --> 01:07:01.890
As you see, I kept my promise, too.

964
01:07:01.975 --> 01:07:04.309
It's all over.

965
01:07:04.394 --> 01:07:07.479
-What's all over?
-The audition.


966
01:07:07.564 --> 01:07:12.234
-Eve read with Miss Casswell.
-Eve? How enchanting.


967
01:07:12.318 --> 01:07:15.738
How did you get the idea of letting
Eve read with Miss Casswell?


968
01:07:15.822 --> 01:07:20.075
-Well, she's your understudy.
-Eve? My understudy? I had no idea.


969
01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.411
I thought you knew.
She started a week ago.


970
01:07:22.495 --> 01:07:24.747
I've never seen her backstage,

971
01:07:24.831 --> 01:07:28.751
but with so many people loitering about...
Well, well.


972
01:07:28.835 --> 01:07:31.503
So Eve is not
working for Max, after all.

973
01:07:32.672 --> 01:07:35.174
Max, you sly puss.

974
01:07:37.343 --> 01:07:42.264
Miss Channing, I can't tell you
how glad I am that you arrived so late.


975
01:07:42.348 --> 01:07:44.057
Really, Eve? Why?

976
01:07:44.142 --> 01:07:46.518
Otherwise,
I never would have dared to read.


977
01:07:46.644 --> 01:07:49.188
-Why not?
-If you'd come in the middle,


978
01:07:49.272 --> 01:07:51.356
I couldn't have gone on.

979
01:07:51.441 --> 01:07:55.444
What a pity.
All that fire and music being turned off.


980
01:07:55.528 --> 01:07:58.030
-What fire and music?
-You wouldn't understand.


981
01:07:58.156 --> 01:08:00.199
How was Miss Casswell?

982
01:08:00.325 --> 01:08:02.451
Back to the Copacabana.

983
01:08:02.535 --> 01:08:05.204
But Eve, Margo. 
Let me tell you about Eve.

984
01:08:05.330 --> 01:08:07.039
I was dreadful, 
Miss Channing.

985
01:08:07.123 --> 01:08:10.876
I have no right to be anyone's understudy,
much less yours.


986
01:08:11.002 --> 01:08:13.712
I'm sure you underestimate yourself.
You always do.


987
01:08:13.797 --> 01:08:15.798
You were about to tell me about Eve.

988
01:08:15.882 --> 01:08:17.966
-You'd have been proud of her.
-I'm sure.


989
01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:20.719
-She was a revelation.
-Oh, to you too?


990
01:08:20.804 --> 01:08:24.139
-What do you mean by that?
-It must have been a revelation


991
01:08:24.224 --> 01:08:28.143
to have a 24-year-old character
played by a 24-year-old actress.


992
01:08:28.228 --> 01:08:30.646
-That's beside the point.
-It is the point.


993
01:08:30.730 --> 01:08:33.065
It must have seemed
so new and fresh to you,


994
01:08:33.191 --> 01:08:36.485
so exciting, to have your lines
read just as you wrote them.


995
01:08:36.569 --> 01:08:39.822
-Addison.
-So full of meaning, fire and music.


996
01:08:41.407 --> 01:08:44.076
You've talked to that
venomous fishwife DeWitt.


997
01:08:44.202 --> 01:08:46.995
In this case, as trustworthy
as the world almanac.


998
01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:50.165
You knew when you came in
that Eve was your understudy.


999
01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:52.751
Playing that childish game
of cat and mouse.


1000
01:08:52.877 --> 01:08:56.088
Not mouse. Never mouse. 
If anything, rat.

1001
01:08:56.172 --> 01:08:58.924
Your genius for making a bar-room brawl

1002
01:08:59.008 --> 01:09:01.009
out of a perfectly innocent
misunderstanding.


1003
01:09:01.094 --> 01:09:03.846
Perfectly innocent?
Men have been hanged for less.


1004
01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:06.348
I'm lied to, attacked behind my back,

1005
01:09:06.432 --> 01:09:09.601
accused of reading your play
as if it were the holy gospel.


1006
01:09:09.727 --> 01:09:11.520
I never said it was.

1007
01:09:11.604 --> 01:09:15.941
You listen as if someone else had written
your play. Whom do you have in mind?


1008
01:09:16.067 --> 01:09:19.278
Arthur Miller? Sherwood?
Beaumont and Fletcher?


1009
01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:21.905
-May I say a word?
-No!


1010
01:09:22.782 --> 01:09:27.035
You think Miller or Sherwood would stand
for the nonsense I take from you?


1011
01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:31.415
Stick to Beaumont and Fletcher.
They've been dead for 300 years!


1012
01:09:32.208 --> 01:09:35.294
All playwrights should be dead
for 300 years!


1013
01:09:36.129 --> 01:09:40.716
That would solve none of their problems
because actresses never die!


1014
01:09:44.888 --> 01:09:48.432
The stars never die and never change.

1015
01:09:48.766 --> 01:09:51.226
You may change this star
any time you want


1016
01:09:51.311 --> 01:09:55.564
for a new and fresh and exciting one,
fully equipped with fire and music.


1017
01:09:55.648 --> 01:09:59.818
Any time you want,
starting with tonight's performance.


1018
01:09:59.903 --> 01:10:01.987
This is for lawyers to talk about.

1019
01:10:02.071 --> 01:10:05.824
This concerns a contract
that you cannot rewrite or ad-lib.


1020
01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:10.329
Are you threatening me
with legal action, Mr. Fabian?


1021
01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:14.917
-Are you breaking the contract?
-Answer my question.


1022
01:10:15.001 --> 01:10:19.087
-Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
-I don't hear you.


1023
01:10:19.172 --> 01:10:23.091
-I said I'm a dying man!
-Not until the last drugstore


1024
01:10:23.176 --> 01:10:25.928
has sold its last pill.

1025
01:10:26.012 --> 01:10:29.765
I shall never understand the process
by which a body with a voice


1026
01:10:29.849 --> 01:10:32.267
suddenly fancies itself as a mind.

1027
01:10:32.352 --> 01:10:34.853
Just when does an actress decide

1028
01:10:34.979 --> 01:10:38.523
they're her words she's saying
and her thoughts she's expressing?


1029
01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:42.277
Usually at the point
when she has to rewrite and rethink them


1030
01:10:42.362 --> 01:10:45.030
to keep the audience
from leaving the theatre.


1031
01:10:45.114 --> 01:10:49.993
It's about time the piano realized
it has not written the concerto!


1032
01:10:55.041 --> 01:11:01.838
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski
who plays his concerto on me, the piano?


1033
01:11:03.633 --> 01:11:06.218
Where is Princess Fire and Music?

1034
01:11:06.302 --> 01:11:08.804
-Who?
-The kid. Junior.


1035
01:11:14.352 --> 01:11:17.396
-Gone.
-I must have frightened her away.


1036
01:11:17.522 --> 01:11:20.399
I wouldn't be surprised.
Sometimes you frighten me.


1037
01:11:20.525 --> 01:11:23.902
Poor little flower.
Dropped her petals and folded her tent.


1038
01:11:24.028 --> 01:11:27.322
-Don't mix your metaphors.
-I'll mix what I like!


1039
01:11:27.407 --> 01:11:30.575
I'm nothing but a body with a voice.
No mind.


1040
01:11:30.702 --> 01:11:33.161
What a body. What a voice.

1041
01:11:33.913 --> 01:11:37.916
That ex ship-news reporter.
No body, no voice, all mind.


1042
01:11:38.084 --> 01:11:40.961
The gong rang, the fight's over,
calm down.


1043
01:11:41.045 --> 01:11:42.587
I will not calm down.

1044
01:11:42.714 --> 01:11:45.215
Don't calm down.

1045
01:11:47.885 --> 01:11:52.264
-You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
-I'm trying terribly hard.


1046
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:56.852
Well, you needn't be. I will not be
tolerated and I will not be plotted against.


1047
01:11:56.936 --> 01:12:00.188
-Here we go.
-Such nonsense. What do you take me for?


1048
01:12:00.273 --> 01:12:02.149
Little Nell from the country?

1049
01:12:02.233 --> 01:12:04.860
Been my understudy for a week
without me knowing it.


1050
01:12:04.944 --> 01:12:08.030
-Carefully hidden, no doubt.
-Don't get carried away.


1051
01:12:08.114 --> 01:12:11.616
Arrives here for an audition
when everyone knows I will be here,


1052
01:12:11.743 --> 01:12:16.538
-and gives a performance out of nowhere.
-You've been all through that with Lloyd.


1053
01:12:16.622 --> 01:12:20.792
The playwright doesn't make the
performance. It doesn't just happen.


1054
01:12:20.877 --> 01:12:23.795
Full of fire and music and whatnot.

1055
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.298
Carefully rehearsed, 
I have no doubt.

1056
01:12:26.382 --> 01:12:29.134
Full of those Bill Sampson touches.

1057
01:12:29.218 --> 01:12:32.721
-I am tired of these paranoiac outbursts.
-Paranoiac?


1058
01:12:32.805 --> 01:12:35.891
I didn't know Eve was
your understudy until this afternoon.


1059
01:12:35.975 --> 01:12:37.893
Tell that to Dr. Freud
along with the rest of it.


1060
01:12:37.977 --> 01:12:41.813
No, I'll tell it to
you for the last time.

1061
01:12:41.898 --> 01:12:46.401
Cos you've got to stop hurting the two
of us by these paranoiac tantrums.


1062
01:12:46.486 --> 01:12:48.612
That word.
I don't even know what it means.


1063
01:12:48.696 --> 01:12:50.155
It's time you found out.

1064
01:12:50.239 --> 01:12:52.824
-I love you. I love you.
-Hah!


1065
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:55.994
-You're beautiful and intelligent.
-A body with a voice.


1066
01:12:56.079 --> 01:12:59.831
A beautiful and an intelligent woman,
and a great actress.


1067
01:13:00.958 --> 01:13:05.087
A great actress at the peak of her career.
You have every reason for happiness.


1068
01:13:05.171 --> 01:13:07.089
-Except happiness.
-Every reason.


1069
01:13:07.173 --> 01:13:11.843
But due to some uncontrollable drive,
you permit the slightest action of a kid...


1070
01:13:11.969 --> 01:13:15.847
-A kid!
-...a kid to turn you into a screaming harpy.


1071
01:13:15.973 --> 01:13:18.308
Now, once and for all, stop it.

1072
01:13:36.202 --> 01:13:38.703
It's obvious you're not a woman.

1073
01:13:39.622 --> 01:13:43.708
-I've been aware of that for some time.
-Well, I am.


1074
01:13:43.835 --> 01:13:45.877
I'll say.

1075
01:13:46.379 --> 01:13:48.463
Don't be condescending.

1076
01:13:48.548 --> 01:13:51.049
Come on, get up. 
I'll buy you a drink.

1077
01:13:51.175 --> 01:13:53.093
I may have seen better days,

1078
01:13:53.177 --> 01:13:56.388
but I'm still not to be had
for the price of a cocktail.


1079
01:13:56.472 --> 01:13:58.557
Like a salted peanut.

1080
01:13:59.684 --> 01:14:04.396
-Margo, let's make peace.
-The terms are too high.


1081
01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:08.900
Just being happy? Just stopping
all this nonsense about Eve?


1082
01:14:09.026 --> 01:14:11.653
-And Eve and me?
-It's not nonsense.


1083
01:14:11.737 --> 01:14:16.032
But if I tell you it is, as I just did,
were you listening to me?


1084
01:14:17.577 --> 01:14:21.413
-Isn’t that enough?
-I wish it were.


1085
01:14:21.539 --> 01:14:24.082
Then what would be enough?

1086
01:14:24.208 --> 01:14:26.501
If we got married?

1087
01:14:26.586 --> 01:14:29.838
I wouldn't want you to marry me
just to prove something.


1088
01:14:29.922 --> 01:14:33.675
You've had so many reasons
for not wanting to marry me.


1089
01:14:34.886 --> 01:14:38.263
Margo, tell me what's behind all this.

1090
01:14:38.347 --> 01:14:40.348
I don't know, Bill.

1091
01:14:40.433 --> 01:14:42.851
It's just a feeling. I don't know.

1092
01:14:42.935 --> 01:14:44.936
I think you do know.

1093
01:14:45.021 --> 01:14:47.731
But you won't or can't tell me.

1094
01:14:49.108 --> 01:14:53.695
I said before it was gonna be
my last try, and I meant it.


1095
01:14:53.779 --> 01:14:57.365
I can't think of anything else to do.
I wish I could.


1096
01:14:58.701 --> 01:15:01.953
We usually wind up screaming
as the curtain comes down.


1097
01:15:02.079 --> 01:15:04.706
Then it comes up again
and everything's fine.


1098
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:06.917
But not this time.

1099
01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:11.713
No playwright in the world
could make me believe


1100
01:15:11.797 --> 01:15:15.133
this would happen
between two adult people.


1101
01:15:16.469 --> 01:15:18.595
Goodbye, Margo.

1102
01:15:24.644 --> 01:15:26.937
Bill?

1103
01:15:28.606 --> 01:15:31.066
Where are you going?

1104
01:15:31.150 --> 01:15:33.443
To find Eve?

1105
01:15:35.112 --> 01:15:38.657
That suddenly makes
the whole thing believable.


1106
01:16:00.972 --> 01:16:03.014
Lloyd.

1107
01:16:04.016 --> 01:16:07.852
-Lloyd, what's happened?
-Up to here, that's where I've got it.


1108
01:16:07.937 --> 01:16:10.689
Of all the star-ridden,
presumptuous, hysterical...


1109
01:16:10.815 --> 01:16:12.691
-Margo again.
-And again and again.


1110
01:16:12.775 --> 01:16:15.944
-Two hours late for the audition.
-That's on time for Margo.


1111
01:16:16.028 --> 01:16:19.948
And then a childish routine about
not knowing Eve was her understudy.


1112
01:16:20.032 --> 01:16:22.367
-It's possible she didn't.
-She knew.


1113
01:16:22.493 --> 01:16:26.538
Addison told her how superbly
Eve had read the part.


1114
01:16:26.622 --> 01:16:30.875
Karen, let me tell you about Eve.
She's got everything. A born actress.


1115
01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.296
Sensitive, understanding,
young, exciting...


1116
01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:35.547
You'll run out of adjectives, dear.

1117
01:16:35.673 --> 01:16:39.050
Everything a playwright first thinks
of wanting to write about,


1118
01:16:39.135 --> 01:16:42.137
until his play becomes
a vehicle for Miss Channing.


1119
01:16:42.221 --> 01:16:44.222
Margo hasn't done badly by it.

1120
01:16:44.307 --> 01:16:47.142
Margo's great.
She knows it, that's the trouble.


1121
01:16:47.226 --> 01:16:50.478
She can play Peck's Bad Boy
all she wants and who's to stop her?


1122
01:16:50.563 --> 01:16:54.733
Who's to give her that boot
in the rear she needs and deserves?


1123
01:16:56.193 --> 01:16:58.987
It's gonna be a cozy weekend.

1124
01:16:59.071 --> 01:17:02.157
-What is?
-We're driving to the country tomorrow.


1125
01:17:02.241 --> 01:17:05.577
Just the four of us. Bill, 
Margo, you and I.

1126
01:17:05.661 --> 01:17:09.497
Well, we've spent weekends
before with nobody talking.


1127
01:17:09.582 --> 01:17:14.210
Just be sure to lock up all blunt
instruments and throwable objects.


1128
01:17:17.340 --> 01:17:18.923
Newton, they say,

1129
01:17:19.008 --> 01:17:22.344
thought of gravity
by getting hit on the head by an apple.


1130
01:17:22.428 --> 01:17:25.013
And the man
who invented the steam-engine,


1131
01:17:25.097 --> 01:17:26.931
he was watching a teakettle.

1132
01:17:27.016 --> 01:17:31.686
But not me. My big idea came
to me just sitting on a couch.


1133
01:17:32.772 --> 01:17:36.691
That boot in the rear to Margo.
Heaven knows, she had one coming.


1134
01:17:36.776 --> 01:17:41.112
From me, from Lloyd, from Eve,
Bill, Max and so on.


1135
01:17:41.197 --> 01:17:44.616
We'd all felt those size fives
of hers often enough.


1136
01:17:44.742 --> 01:17:48.286
But how? The answer was
buzzing around me like a fly.


1137
01:17:49.246 --> 01:17:51.289
I had it.

1138
01:17:51.415 --> 01:17:55.627
But I let it go.
Screaming and calling names is one thing,


1139
01:17:55.711 --> 01:17:57.796
but this could mean...

1140
01:17:59.632 --> 01:18:03.968
Why not? "Why," I said to myself, "not?"

1141
01:18:04.053 --> 01:18:06.388
It would all seem perfectly legitimate.

1142
01:18:06.472 --> 01:18:09.224
And only two people in the world
would know.


1143
01:18:09.308 --> 01:18:13.395
Also, the boot would land where it would
do the most good for all concerned.


1144
01:18:13.479 --> 01:18:16.398
After all,
it was no more than a harmless joke


1145
01:18:16.482 --> 01:18:19.567
which Margo herself
would be the first to enjoy.


1146
01:18:19.652 --> 01:18:23.822
And no reason why she shouldn't
be told about it, in time.


1147
01:18:31.831 --> 01:18:36.334
Hello. Will you please call
Miss Eve Harrington to the phone?


1148
01:18:37.753 --> 01:18:39.838
Not at all. I'll wait.

1149
01:18:41.841 --> 01:18:45.593
It was a cold weekend,
outside and in.


1150
01:18:45.678 --> 01:18:47.512
Bill didn't come at all.

1151
01:18:47.638 --> 01:18:52.434
Margo didn't know where he was
and didn't care, she kept saying.


1152
01:18:52.518 --> 01:18:55.019
Somehow we staggered through Sunday,

1153
01:18:55.146 --> 01:18:58.940
and by the time we drove Margo
to the station late Monday afternoon,


1154
01:18:59.024 --> 01:19:04.112
she and Lloyd had thawed out
to the extent of being civil to each other.


1155
01:19:04.196 --> 01:19:05.655
What time is it?

1156
01:19:05.739 --> 01:19:08.366
When you asked a
minute ago, it was 5.42.

1157
01:19:08.492 --> 01:19:11.619
It is now 5.43.
When you ask again a minute from now...


1158
01:19:11.704 --> 01:19:16.124
I just don't want Margo to miss her train.
As it is, she'll barely make the theatre.


1159
01:19:16.208 --> 01:19:19.961
5.55. We'll be at the station
in plenty of time.


1160
01:19:20.045 --> 01:19:23.798
That little place
"just two hours from New York."


1161
01:19:23.883 --> 01:19:25.800
It's on my list of things
I'll never understand,


1162
01:19:25.885 --> 01:19:29.220
like collecting shrunken Indian heads.

1163
01:19:29.346 --> 01:19:32.724
You should know what it means
to want a little peace and quiet.


1164
01:19:32.850 --> 01:19:35.560
Peace and quiet is for libraries.

1165
01:19:35.686 --> 01:19:37.812
Lloyd. Please.

1166
01:19:37.897 --> 01:19:41.649
Just a little skid, that's all.
This road's like glass.


1167
01:19:41.734 --> 01:19:45.904
-Karen and I just don't want an accident.
-I don't intend to have an accident.


1168
01:19:45.988 --> 01:19:50.241
It isn't important whether you do.
We are wearing long underwear.


1169
01:19:52.411 --> 01:19:54.537
Now what's this?

1170
01:20:10.221 --> 01:20:12.430
But it can't be. 
We can't be out of gas.

1171
01:20:12.515 --> 01:20:17.185
I filled it myself yesterday. Wasn't it full
when you drove to Brewster this morning?


1172
01:20:17.269 --> 01:20:20.772
I didn't look. You know
I don't pay attention to those things.


1173
01:20:20.898 --> 01:20:22.440
Just incredible.

1174
01:20:22.525 --> 01:20:25.610
-How much time have we got?
-Roughly ten minutes.


1175
01:20:25.736 --> 01:20:28.696
-How far is the station?
-About three or four miles.


1176
01:20:28.781 --> 01:20:33.117
-Any houses where we can borrow gas?
-There's not much along this back road.


1177
01:20:33.202 --> 01:20:36.454
Not many cars either.
Not much chance of a lift.


1178
01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:40.750
No sense in sitting here. I'm gonna
walk up about half a mile, just in case.


1179
01:20:58.727 --> 01:21:01.479
-You want it on?
-It doesn't matter.


1180
01:21:02.064 --> 01:21:04.315
I detest cheap sentiment.

1181
01:21:10.656 --> 01:21:13.157
-Karen?
-Mm-hm?


1182
01:21:13.284 --> 01:21:14.409
No, thank you.

1183
01:21:14.493 --> 01:21:19.163
-I haven't been very pleasant this weekend.
-We've all been a little tense lately.


1184
01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:22.208
Come to think of it,
I haven't been very pleasant for weeks.


1185
01:21:22.293 --> 01:21:24.335
For that, I'm truly sorry.

1186
01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:28.339
More than any two people I know, I don't
want you and Lloyd to be angry with me.


1187
01:21:28.465 --> 01:21:32.427
We're never deeply angry.
We just get mad the way you do.


1188
01:21:32.511 --> 01:21:34.596
We know you too well.

1189
01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:37.265
So many people know me.

1190
01:21:37.349 --> 01:21:40.518
I wish I did.
I wish someone would tell me about me.


1191
01:21:40.811 --> 01:21:43.521
You're Margo. Just Margo.

1192
01:21:44.189 --> 01:21:49.027
And what is that? Besides something
spelled out in light bulbs, I mean.


1193
01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:54.907
Besides a temperament, which consists
mostly of swooping about on a broomstick


1194
01:21:54.992 --> 01:21:57.285
and screaming at the top of my voice.

1195
01:21:57.369 --> 01:21:59.871
Infants behave the way I do, you know.

1196
01:21:59.997 --> 01:22:04.375
They carry on and misbehave.
They'd get drunk if they knew how,


1197
01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:07.295
when they can't have what they want.

1198
01:22:07.379 --> 01:22:10.632
When they feel unwanted or insecure or...

1199
01:22:11.508 --> 01:22:13.384
...unloved.

1200
01:22:15.012 --> 01:22:18.389
-What about Bill?
-What about Bill?


1201
01:22:18.515 --> 01:22:20.141
He's in love with you.

1202
01:22:20.225 --> 01:22:25.063
More than anything in this world,
I love Bill. And I want Bill.


1203
01:22:25.147 --> 01:22:27.231
And I want him to want me.

1204
01:22:27.316 --> 01:22:29.400
But me, not Margo Channing.

1205
01:22:30.402 --> 01:22:33.363
And if I can't tell
them apart, how can he?

1206
01:22:34.073 --> 01:22:36.574
Well, why should he and why should you?

1207
01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:38.660
Bill's in love with Margo Channing.

1208
01:22:38.744 --> 01:22:41.579
He's fought with her, worked with her,
loved her.


1209
01:22:41.705 --> 01:22:46.000
But ten years from now
Margo Channing will have ceased to exist.


1210
01:22:46.085 --> 01:22:49.712
And what's left will be... What?

1211
01:22:50.756 --> 01:22:54.092
Margo, Bill is all of
eight years younger than you.


1212
01:22:54.176 --> 01:22:59.180
Those years stretch as the years go on.
I've seen it happen too often.


1213
01:22:59.264 --> 01:23:01.516
Not to you, not to Bill.

1214
01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:04.435
Isn’t that what they always say?

1215
01:23:09.274 --> 01:23:12.110
I don't suppose the heater runs
if the motor doesn't.


1216
01:23:12.236 --> 01:23:13.403
Silly, isn't it?

1217
01:23:13.487 --> 01:23:17.782
You'd think they'd fix it so people
could just sit in a car and keep warm.


1218
01:23:18.575 --> 01:23:20.952
About Eve.

1219
01:23:21.036 --> 01:23:24.414
I've acted pretty disgracefully
toward her too.


1220
01:23:25.416 --> 01:23:28.292
-Well...
-Don't fumble for excuses.


1221
01:23:28.419 --> 01:23:31.129
Not here and now with my hair down.

1222
01:23:32.256 --> 01:23:35.967
At best,
let's say I've been oversensitive to...


1223
01:23:36.051 --> 01:23:40.972
Well, to the fact that she's so young,
so feminine and so helpless.


1224
01:23:41.098 --> 01:23:44.308
To so many things I
want to be for Bill.

1225
01:23:45.477 --> 01:23:47.186
It's funny, a woman's career.

1226
01:23:47.271 --> 01:23:51.899
The things you drop on your way up
so you can move faster.


1227
01:23:51.984 --> 01:23:55.903
You forget you'll need them again
when you get back to being a woman.


1228
01:23:55.988 --> 01:24:00.908
That's one career all females have
in common, whether we like it or not.


1229
01:24:00.993 --> 01:24:03.077
Being a woman.

1230
01:24:03.162 --> 01:24:05.788
Sooner or later, we've
got to work at it.

1231
01:24:06.498 --> 01:24:10.168
No matter how many
other careers we've had or wanted.


1232
01:24:11.587 --> 01:24:15.339
And in the last analysis,
nothing's any good unless you can


1233
01:24:15.424 --> 01:24:18.009
look up just before dinner or

1234
01:24:18.135 --> 01:24:20.762
turn around in bed and there he is.

1235
01:24:20.846 --> 01:24:23.097
Without that, you're not a woman.

1236
01:24:23.182 --> 01:24:28.686
You're something with a French provincial
office or a... A book full of clippings.


1237
01:24:30.022 --> 01:24:32.523
But you're not a woman.

1238
01:24:36.195 --> 01:24:38.529
Slow curtain. The end.

1239
01:24:41.033 --> 01:24:45.870
Margo. Margo, I want you
to know how sorry I am about this.


1240
01:24:46.330 --> 01:24:48.790
-About what?
-This.


1241
01:24:48.874 --> 01:24:51.542
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

1242
01:24:51.668 --> 01:24:54.629
Don't give it a thought.
One of destiny's merry pranks.


1243
01:24:54.713 --> 01:24:59.383
After all, you didn't personally
drain the gasoline tank yourself.


1244
01:25:06.308 --> 01:25:08.559
Eve, of course, was superb.

1245
01:25:08.644 --> 01:25:09.811
Many of the audience

1246
01:25:09.895 --> 01:25:13.731
understandably preferred to return
another time to see Margo.


1247
01:25:13.816 --> 01:25:18.319
But those who remained cheered loudly,
lustily and long for Eve.


1248
01:25:18.403 --> 01:25:22.073
How thoughtful of her to call
and invite me that afternoon.


1249
01:25:22.199 --> 01:25:25.576
And what a happy coincidence
that several representatives


1250
01:25:25.661 --> 01:25:28.162
of other newspapers
happened to be present.


1251
01:25:28.247 --> 01:25:30.498
All of us invited that afternoon

1252
01:25:30.582 --> 01:25:33.334
to attend an understudy's performance,

1253
01:25:33.418 --> 01:25:35.253
about which
the management knew nothing


1254
01:25:35.379 --> 01:25:38.923
until they were forced
to ring up the curtain at nine o'clock.


1255
01:25:39.049 --> 01:25:40.424
Coincidence.

1256
01:25:40.551 --> 01:25:42.844
You were better than all right.

1257
01:25:42.928 --> 01:25:46.514
You rang a bell. Little things
here and there, but it doesn't matter.


1258
01:25:46.598 --> 01:25:49.183
Be proud of yourself.
You've got a right to be.


1259
01:25:49.268 --> 01:25:51.352
Are you proud of me, Bill?

1260
01:25:51.436 --> 01:25:54.438
I admit I was worried
when Max called. I had my doubts.


1261
01:25:54.731 --> 01:25:59.026
-You shouldn't have had any doubts.
-After all, the other day was one scene.


1262
01:25:59.111 --> 01:26:01.696
The woods
are full of one-scene sensations.


1263
01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:05.616
But you did it. With work and patience,
you'll be a good actress


1264
01:26:05.742 --> 01:26:09.036
-if that's what you wanna be.
-Is that what you want me to be?


1265
01:26:09.121 --> 01:26:13.207
-I'm talking about you and what you want.
-So am I.


1266
01:26:15.127 --> 01:26:18.462
-What have I got to do with it?
-Everything.


1267
01:26:21.049 --> 01:26:25.761
The names I've been called,
but never Svengali. Good luck.


1268
01:26:28.557 --> 01:26:31.225
Don't run away, Bill.

1269
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:33.811
From what would I be running?

1270
01:26:35.606 --> 01:26:39.483
You're always after truth
on the stage. What about off?


1271
01:26:40.277 --> 01:26:43.613
-I'm for it.
-Then face it. I have.


1272
01:26:43.947 --> 01:26:47.158
Ever since that first night in here.

1273
01:26:47.242 --> 01:26:49.327
I told you
what every actress should know.


1274
01:26:49.453 --> 01:26:53.414
You told me that whatever I became,
it would be because of you.


1275
01:26:53.498 --> 01:26:56.500
-Make-up's a little heavy.
-And for you.


1276
01:26:57.502 --> 01:27:00.504
-You're quite a girl.
-You think?


1277
01:27:00.589 --> 01:27:05.593
-I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
-You hear all kinds of things.


1278
01:27:05.677 --> 01:27:09.597
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary,
and I'm as curious as the next man.


1279
01:27:09.681 --> 01:27:12.600
-Find out.
-Only thing:


1280
01:27:12.684 --> 01:27:14.936
what I go after
I want to go after.

1281
01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:17.104
I don't want it to come after me.

1282
01:27:24.029 --> 01:27:27.865
Don't cry. Just score it
as an incomplete forward pass.


1283
01:27:49.972 --> 01:27:52.056
Who is it?

1284
01:27:53.725 --> 01:27:55.851
May I come in?

1285
01:27:56.895 --> 01:27:58.980
Certainly, Mr. DeWitt.

1286
01:28:02.025 --> 01:28:06.153
I expected to find this room
with a theatreful of people at your feet.


1287
01:28:06.238 --> 01:28:10.741
-I'm lucky they didn't throw things.
-Your performance was no surprise to me.


1288
01:28:10.826 --> 01:28:14.245
After the other day, I regarded it
as simply a promise fulfilled.


1289
01:28:14.371 --> 01:28:18.416
You're more than kind. But it's
still Miss Channing's performance.


1290
01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:21.752
I'm the carbon copy you read
when you can't find the original.


1291
01:28:21.878 --> 01:28:27.091
-You're more than modest.
-It's not modesty. I don't try to kid myself.


1292
01:28:27.217 --> 01:28:29.593
A revolutionary approach to the theatre.

1293
01:28:29.678 --> 01:28:34.098
-But if I may make a suggestion...
-Please do.


1294
01:28:34.224 --> 01:28:37.268
I think the time has come
to shed some of your humility.


1295
01:28:37.352 --> 01:28:41.564
It is just as false not to blow your horn
at all as it is to blow it too loudly.


1296
01:28:41.857 --> 01:28:44.692
I don't think I've done anything
to sound off about.


1297
01:28:44.776 --> 01:28:48.863
We come into this world with our little
egos equipped with individual horns.


1298
01:28:48.947 --> 01:28:51.032
If we don't blow them, who else will?

1299
01:28:51.116 --> 01:28:57.538
Even so. One pretty good performance by
an understudy, it'll be forgotten tomorrow.


1300
01:28:58.874 --> 01:29:01.709
It needn't be.

1301
01:29:01.793 --> 01:29:07.465
Even if I wanted to, as you say,
be less humble, blow my own horn,


1302
01:29:08.633 --> 01:29:11.635
how would I do it? 
I'm less than nobody.

1303
01:29:12.804 --> 01:29:16.223
-I'm somebody.
-You certainly are.


1304
01:29:17.642 --> 01:29:21.270
Leave the door open a
bit, so we can talk.

1305
01:29:25.942 --> 01:29:30.488
After you change, if you're not busy
elsewhere, we could have supper.


1306
01:29:30.822 --> 01:29:33.949
I'd love to. Or
should I pretend I'm busy?

1307
01:29:34.326 --> 01:29:38.496
Let's have a minimum of pretending.
I shall want to do a column about you.


1308
01:29:38.622 --> 01:29:40.915
I'm not even enough for a paragraph.

1309
01:29:40.999 --> 01:29:42.917
Perhaps more than one.

1310
01:29:43.001 --> 01:29:45.836
There's so much I want to know.
I've heard your story in part.


1311
01:29:45.962 --> 01:29:48.255
Your home in Wisconsin,
your tragic marriage,


1312
01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:50.758
your fanatical attachment to Margo.

1313
01:29:50.842 --> 01:29:53.928
It started in San Francisco, didn't it?

1314
01:29:54.846 --> 01:29:59.266
I say your idolatry of Margo
started in San Francisco, didn't it?


1315
01:29:59.351 --> 01:30:00.518
That's right.

1316
01:30:00.644 --> 01:30:04.522
San Francisco, an oasis of
civilization in the California desert.


1317
01:30:04.648 --> 01:30:08.943
Tell me, do you share
my high opinion of San Francisco?


1318
01:30:09.027 --> 01:30:11.112
Yes, I do.

1319
01:30:11.822 --> 01:30:16.117
And that memorable night when Margo
first dazzled you from the stage,


1320
01:30:16.201 --> 01:30:20.371
what theatre was it in San Francisco?
Was it the Shubert?


1321
01:30:20.455 --> 01:30:22.540
Yes, the Shubert.

1322
01:30:23.125 --> 01:30:26.794
Fine old theatre, the Shubert.
Full of tradition.


1323
01:30:26.878 --> 01:30:30.673
Untouched by the earthquake.
Or should I say fire?


1324
01:30:30.799 --> 01:30:33.551
Tell me, what was your husband's name?

1325
01:30:34.553 --> 01:30:36.637
-Eddie.
-Eddie what?


1326
01:30:40.559 --> 01:30:44.395
I'm about to go into the shower.
I won't be able to hear you.


1327
01:30:44.479 --> 01:30:46.313
Well, it can wait.

1328
01:30:46.398 --> 01:30:49.650
Where would you like to go?
We must make this a special night.


1329
01:30:49.734 --> 01:30:52.987
You take charge.

1330
01:30:53.071 --> 01:30:54.989
I believe I will.

1331
01:31:09.254 --> 01:31:13.090
Some morning papers carried
a squib about Eve's performance.


1332
01:31:13.175 --> 01:31:15.593
Not much, but full of praise.

1333
01:31:15.719 --> 01:31:18.262
I couldn't imagine
how they found out about it.


1334
01:31:18.388 --> 01:31:22.516
But Lloyd said Max's publicity man
probably sent out the story.


1335
01:31:22.601 --> 01:31:25.936
At any rate, I felt terribly guilty
and ashamed of myself


1336
01:31:26.062 --> 01:31:29.440
and wanted nothing so much
as to forget the whole thing.


1337
01:31:29.524 --> 01:31:31.859
Margo and I were having lunch at 21,

1338
01:31:31.943 --> 01:31:34.570
just like girlfriends, with hats on.

1339
01:31:36.615 --> 01:31:38.949
-Has Miss Channing come in?
-Not yet.


1340
01:31:39.075 --> 01:31:41.118
Thank you.

1341
01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:46.540
Oh, Eve! I've heard the most wonderful
things about your performance.


1342
01:31:46.625 --> 01:31:49.001
Relief that I managed
to stagger through it.


1343
01:31:49.085 --> 01:31:50.127
She was magnificent.

1344
01:31:50.212 --> 01:31:52.463
-Then you've heard, too.
-I was there.


1345
01:31:52.547 --> 01:31:55.549
-You were at the play last night?
-A happy coincidence.


1346
01:31:55.634 --> 01:31:59.887
-We're having lunch with a talent scout.
-They certainly don't waste much time.


1347
01:31:59.971 --> 01:32:03.724
-It's nothing definite. Just lunch.
-They'll be wasting their time.


1348
01:32:03.808 --> 01:32:06.894
Eve has no intention
of going to Hollywood.


1349
01:32:06.978 --> 01:32:10.231
By your smart dress,
I take it your companion is a lady?


1350
01:32:10.315 --> 01:32:12.566
-Margo.
-Margo lunching in public?


1351
01:32:12.651 --> 01:32:15.486
It's a new Margo,
but she's just as late as the old one.


1352
01:32:15.612 --> 01:32:18.113
She may be later than you think.

1353
01:32:21.576 --> 01:32:24.328
Why not read my column
to pass the time?


1354
01:32:24.454 --> 01:32:27.248
-The minutes will fly like hours.
-Thank you, Addison.


1355
01:32:27.332 --> 01:32:30.000
Now we must join
our sunburned eager beaver.


1356
01:32:30.085 --> 01:32:32.169
-Goodbye, Karen.
-Goodbye.


1357
01:32:55.026 --> 01:32:57.778
"And so my hat which has,
lo, these many seasons,


1358
01:32:57.862 --> 01:33:01.699
"become firmly rooted about my ears,
is lifted to Miss Harrington.


1359
01:33:01.783 --> 01:33:05.786
"I am available for dancing in the streets
and shouting from the housetops."


1360
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:09.623
I thought that one went out
with Woollcott. Now listen to this.


1361
01:33:09.708 --> 01:33:14.044
"Miss Harrington had much to tell and
these columns shall report her faithfully


1362
01:33:14.170 --> 01:33:18.048
"about the lamentable practice
in our theatre of permitting


1363
01:33:18.174 --> 01:33:21.051
"mature actresses
to continue playing roles


1364
01:33:21.177 --> 01:33:25.556
"requiring a youth and vigor
of which they retain but a dim memory."


1365
01:33:25.682 --> 01:33:28.809
-I just can't believe it.
-It gets better.


1366
01:33:28.893 --> 01:33:33.397
"About the understandable reluctance
of our entrenched first ladies of the stage


1367
01:33:33.523 --> 01:33:36.317
"to encourage, shall we say,
younger actresses,


1368
01:33:36.401 --> 01:33:39.987
"and Miss Harrington's unsupported
struggle for opportunity."


1369
01:33:40.071 --> 01:33:43.157
-I can't believe Eve said those things.
-In this rat race,


1370
01:33:43.241 --> 01:33:45.993
everybody's guilty till proved innocent.

1371
01:33:46.077 --> 01:33:50.748
One of the differences between
the theatre and civilization.


1372
01:33:50.832 --> 01:33:52.041
What gets me

1373
01:33:52.125 --> 01:33:55.836
is how all the papers happened
to catch that particular performance.


1374
01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:58.005
Lloyd says it's a publicity release.

1375
01:33:58.089 --> 01:34:00.841
The witch
must have sent out Indian Runners,


1376
01:34:00.925 --> 01:34:06.180
snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms
and museums or wherever they hole up.


1377
01:34:06.264 --> 01:34:07.556
She won't get away with it.

1378
01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:10.017
Nor will Addison DeWitt
and his poison pen.


1379
01:34:10.101 --> 01:34:13.771
If Equity or my lawyer can't
or won't do anything about it,


1380
01:34:13.855 --> 01:34:18.817
I shall personally stuff that pathetic little
lost lamb down Mr. DeWitt's ugly throat!


1381
01:34:29.788 --> 01:34:34.458
I came as soon as I read that piece of filth.
I ran all the way.


1382
01:34:45.804 --> 01:34:48.222
Bill's here, baby.

1383
01:34:48.306 --> 01:34:50.391
Everything's all right now.

1384
01:34:58.483 --> 01:35:02.152
I guess at this point
I'm what the French call "de trop."


1385
01:35:02.237 --> 01:35:04.947
Maybe just a little around the edges.

1386
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:21.588
It's Addison from start to finish.
It drips with his brand of venom.


1387
01:35:21.673 --> 01:35:24.341
Taking advantage of a kid,
twisting her words,


1388
01:35:24.426 --> 01:35:27.177
making her say what
he wanted her to say.

1389
01:35:27.303 --> 01:35:30.764
-Where did you get all that information?
-Eve.


1390
01:35:30.849 --> 01:35:33.851
-Eve?
-She's been to see me.


1391
01:35:33.977 --> 01:35:37.271
She left just before you came in.
You just missed her.


1392
01:35:37.355 --> 01:35:40.858
-That was a pity.
-Wanted to explain about the interview.


1393
01:35:40.942 --> 01:35:44.695
Wanted to apologize to someone,
and didn't dare face Margo.


1394
01:35:44.821 --> 01:35:48.699
-I wonder why.
-She started talking and couldn't finish.


1395
01:35:48.825 --> 01:35:50.868
She cried so.

1396
01:35:52.454 --> 01:35:56.540
I've been going over our financial position,
if you'll pardon the expression.


1397
01:35:56.666 --> 01:36:01.128
-That's quite a change of subject.
-What with taxes coming up, and,


1398
01:36:01.212 --> 01:36:05.132
since I'm a playwright and not
an oil-well operator, I was thinking...


1399
01:36:05.216 --> 01:36:07.468
I'm trying hard to follow you.

1400
01:36:07.552 --> 01:36:11.305
Instead of waiting until next season
to do Footsteps on the Ceiling,


1401
01:36:11.389 --> 01:36:13.223
which is in pretty good shape,

1402
01:36:13.349 --> 01:36:17.227
and if Margo can be talked into
going on tour with Aged in Wood,


1403
01:36:17.353 --> 01:36:20.481
we could put Footsteps
into production right away.


1404
01:36:20.565 --> 01:36:24.318
-I'm beginning to catch up.
-If we can cast it properly, that is.


1405
01:36:24.402 --> 01:36:27.029
Maybe get some younger actress?

1406
01:36:27.113 --> 01:36:29.239
Someone who'd look the part
as well as play it?


1407
01:36:29.365 --> 01:36:33.994
-You've got to admit, it'd be a novelty.
-Now you're quoting Addison or Eve.


1408
01:36:34.078 --> 01:36:36.497
Eve did mention the play, but in passing.

1409
01:36:36.581 --> 01:36:39.583
She'd never have the nerve
to ask to play a part like Cora.


1410
01:36:39.667 --> 01:36:42.753
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.

1411
01:36:42.879 --> 01:36:46.173
I got the idea myself while
she was talking about the play.


1412
01:36:46.257 --> 01:36:49.092
-With gestures, of course.
-To write something


1413
01:36:49.177 --> 01:36:53.931
and have it realized completely.
For once, not to compromise.


1414
01:36:54.599 --> 01:36:56.475
Lloyd Richards, do not consider

1415
01:36:56.559 --> 01:36:59.186
giving that contemptible little worm
the part of Cora!


1416
01:36:59.270 --> 01:37:04.274
-Now just a minute...
-Margo's not been exactly a compromise.


1417
01:37:04.359 --> 01:37:08.028
Playwrights everywhere would
give their shirts for that compromise.


1418
01:37:08.112 --> 01:37:09.279
Now just a minute...

1419
01:37:09.364 --> 01:37:12.783
Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude
must be contagious.


1420
01:37:12.909 --> 01:37:16.537
All this hysteria because
of an impulsive excited kid


1421
01:37:16.621 --> 01:37:19.540
and a professional
manure-slinger named DeWitt.


1422
01:37:19.624 --> 01:37:23.460
-She apologized, didn't she?
-On her knees, I've no doubt.


1423
01:37:23.586 --> 01:37:26.713
Very touching.
Very Academy of Dramatic Arts.


1424
01:37:26.798 --> 01:37:30.801
That bitter cynicism is something
you've acquired since you left Radcliffe.


1425
01:37:30.927 --> 01:37:35.681
That cynicism I acquired the day I
discovered I was different from little boys.


1426
01:37:37.642 --> 01:37:39.309
Hello.

1427
01:37:39.477 --> 01:37:41.812
Oh, hi, Margo.

1428
01:37:42.230 --> 01:37:44.481
No, not at all.

1429
01:37:45.984 --> 01:37:48.735
Karen and I were just chatting.

1430
01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:49.861
Hm?

1431
01:37:51.906 --> 01:37:55.284
Yes, I'm sure we can
and I'm sure we'd love to.


1432
01:37:55.827 --> 01:37:58.495
Right. 11.45ish.

1433
01:38:00.415 --> 01:38:02.499
See you then.

1434
01:38:03.668 --> 01:38:09.006
Margo and Bill want us to meet them
at the Cub Room tonight after the theatre.


1435
01:38:09.090 --> 01:38:11.675
Margo Channing in the Cub Room.

1436
01:38:11.801 --> 01:38:15.262
I couldn't be more surprised
if she'd said Grant's tomb.


1437
01:38:15.346 --> 01:38:19.516
-I'm glad Bill's back.
-They'd die without each other.


1438
01:38:20.518 --> 01:38:24.021
I didn't promise Eve anything.
I said she'd be fine for the part


1439
01:38:24.147 --> 01:38:26.440
but there were practical difficulties.

1440
01:38:26.524 --> 01:38:28.609
-Such as?
-You, for one.


1441
01:38:28.693 --> 01:38:32.863
I told her you wanted Margo to play
the part and I would want your approval.


1442
01:38:32.947 --> 01:38:35.115
That's fine. Fine and dandy.

1443
01:38:35.199 --> 01:38:39.369
Just refer all of Miss Eve Harrington's
future requests to me.


1444
01:38:43.374 --> 01:38:47.961
The so-called art of acting is not one
for which I have a particularly high regard.


1445
01:38:48.046 --> 01:38:51.506
-Hear, hear.
-But you may quote me as follows.


1446
01:38:51.883 --> 01:38:56.136
"Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave
a performance in your cockamamie play,


1447
01:38:56.220 --> 01:39:02.392
"the like of which I have never seen before
and expect rarely to see again."


1448
01:39:02.477 --> 01:39:06.063
-He does not exaggerate. I was good.
-You were great.


1449
01:39:06.147 --> 01:39:11.401
Quite a night. I hear your understudy,
a Miss Harrington, has given her notice.


1450
01:39:11.527 --> 01:39:13.654
-Too bad.
-I'm broken up about it.


1451
01:39:13.738 --> 01:39:16.573
You just can't pick up
champagne and drink it.


1452
01:39:16.699 --> 01:39:19.159
Somebody's got to be
very witty about a toast.


1453
01:39:19.243 --> 01:39:21.328
I shall propose the toast,

1454
01:39:21.412 --> 01:39:24.581
without wit, with all my heart.

1455
01:39:25.583 --> 01:39:27.334
To Margo.

1456
01:39:27.418 --> 01:39:30.545
-To my bride-to-be.
-Glory hallelujah.


1457
01:39:30.755 --> 01:39:32.839
-Margo.
-Drink.


1458
01:39:35.843 --> 01:39:39.846
-When? When are you going to do it?
-Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten.


1459
01:39:39.931 --> 01:39:42.683
-And you're going to be on time.
-Yes, sir.


1460
01:39:42.767 --> 01:39:45.018
City Hall, that's for prizefighters
and reporters.


1461
01:39:45.103 --> 01:39:48.105
I see a cathedral, banks of flowers...

1462
01:39:48.231 --> 01:39:52.109
It's only for the license.
There's a three-day wait for blood tests.


1463
01:39:52.193 --> 01:39:55.404
I'll marry you if it turns out
you have no blood at all.


1464
01:39:55.697 --> 01:39:58.615
-What are you going to wear?
-Something simple,


1465
01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:00.701
a fur coat over a nightgown.

1466
01:40:00.785 --> 01:40:05.789
The point is this. In a cathedral,
a ballpark or a penny arcade,


1467
01:40:05.915 --> 01:40:09.793
we want you two beside us,
as our nearest and dearest friends.


1468
01:40:09.919 --> 01:40:13.213
Which we are. Which we'll always be.

1469
01:40:13.297 --> 01:40:18.051
There are very few moments in life
as good as this. Let's remember it.


1470
01:40:18.136 --> 01:40:22.055
To each of us and all of us,
never have we been more close.


1471
01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:24.641
May we never be farther apart.

1472
01:40:27.061 --> 01:40:28.979
-Mrs. Richards?
-Yes.


1473
01:40:29.063 --> 01:40:31.148
-For you.
-Thank you.


1474
01:40:32.316 --> 01:40:35.402
Very indiscreet.
A note in the open like that.


1475
01:40:35.486 --> 01:40:38.739
Next time, tell your lover
to blow smoke rings or tap a glass.


1476
01:40:38.823 --> 01:40:41.158
Lloyd, I want you
to be big about this.

1477
01:40:41.242 --> 01:40:44.828
The world is full of love tonight.
No woman is safe.


1478
01:40:44.954 --> 01:40:50.584
Well, this beats all world's records
for running, jumping or standing gall.


1479
01:40:52.253 --> 01:40:55.505
"Forgive my butting in to what
seems such a happy occasion,


1480
01:40:55.590 --> 01:40:57.841
"but it's important that I speak with you.

1481
01:40:57.967 --> 01:41:00.427
"'Please"' and that's underlined,

1482
01:41:00.511 --> 01:41:03.513
"meet me in the ladies' room. Eve."

1483
01:41:04.348 --> 01:41:07.684
I understand she's now
the understudy in there.


1484
01:41:07.810 --> 01:41:10.520
Hand me that empty bottle. 
I may find her.

1485
01:41:12.774 --> 01:41:15.609
Well, look. There's Rasputin.

1486
01:41:21.282 --> 01:41:22.866
Encore du champagne.

1487
01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:26.620
-More champagne, Miss Channing?
-That's what I said, bub.


1488
01:41:26.704 --> 01:41:28.872
Maybe she just wants to apologize.

1489
01:41:28.956 --> 01:41:31.792
I have no interest
in anything she may say.

1490
01:41:31.876 --> 01:41:35.295
But what could she say?
That's what fascinates me.


1491
01:41:35.379 --> 01:41:39.716
-Go on, find out.
-Karen, in all the years of our friendship,


1492
01:41:39.842 --> 01:41:43.386
I have never let you go
to the ladies' room alone.


1493
01:41:43.513 --> 01:41:46.306
Now I must. I
am busting to find out

1494
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:50.894
what's going on in that feverish
little brain waiting in there.


1495
01:41:52.563 --> 01:41:55.690
Well... All right.

1496
01:42:00.738 --> 01:42:02.739
Karen!

1497
01:42:02.865 --> 01:42:04.908
How nice.

1498
01:42:16.420 --> 01:42:19.339
Very effective, but why
take it out on me?

1499
01:42:44.407 --> 01:42:46.616
I was wondering
whether you'd come at all.


1500
01:42:46.701 --> 01:42:49.619
Don't get up. And don't act
as if I were the Queen Mother.


1501
01:42:49.745 --> 01:42:51.788
I don't expect you to be pleasant.

1502
01:42:51.914 --> 01:42:54.040
I don't intend to be.

1503
01:42:54.125 --> 01:42:58.128
Can't we sit down just for a minute?
I've got a lot to say and none of its easy.


1504
01:42:58.254 --> 01:43:00.714
-There can't be very much.
-But there is.


1505
01:43:00.798 --> 01:43:04.718
-Easy or not, I won't believe a word of it.
-Why should you?


1506
01:43:05.636 --> 01:43:07.721
Please sit down.

1507
01:43:13.311 --> 01:43:17.063
You know, I've always considered
myself a very clever girl.


1508
01:43:17.148 --> 01:43:20.400
Smart, good head on my shoulders,
that sort of thing.


1509
01:43:20.484 --> 01:43:23.987
Never the wrong word at the wrong time.

1510
01:43:24.071 --> 01:43:26.573
But then I'd never met Addison DeWitt.

1511
01:43:28.910 --> 01:43:31.077
I remember I had a tooth pulled once.

1512
01:43:31.162 --> 01:43:34.414
They gave me some anaesthetic.
I don't remember the name.


1513
01:43:34.498 --> 01:43:36.333
It affected me strangely.

1514
01:43:36.459 --> 01:43:40.170
I found myself saying things
I wasn't even thinking.


1515
01:43:40.254 --> 01:43:44.341
As if my mind was outside of my body
and couldn't control what I did or said.


1516
01:43:44.425 --> 01:43:47.844
-And you felt like that talking to Addison?
-In a way.


1517
01:43:47.929 --> 01:43:50.555
You find yourself
trying to say what you mean,


1518
01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:52.515
but somehow the words change.

1519
01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:54.684
They become his words.

1520
01:43:54.769 --> 01:43:59.022
And suddenly you're not saying
what you mean, but what he means.


1521
01:43:59.148 --> 01:44:01.816
Do you expect me to believe
that you didn't say any of that?


1522
01:44:01.901 --> 01:44:03.526
That they were all Addison?

1523
01:44:03.653 --> 01:44:06.029
I don't expect you to believe anything,

1524
01:44:06.113 --> 01:44:10.200
except that the responsibility
is mine, and the disgrace.


1525
01:44:11.619 --> 01:44:14.120
Let's not get overdramatic.

1526
01:44:15.706 --> 01:44:18.875
You really have a low opinion
of me, haven't you?


1527
01:44:19.710 --> 01:44:22.045
I'll give you some pleasant news.

1528
01:44:22.171 --> 01:44:26.466
I've been told off
in no uncertain terms, all over town.


1529
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:29.052
Miss Channing should be happy
to hear that.


1530
01:44:29.178 --> 01:44:32.055
To know how loyal her friends are,

1531
01:44:32.181 --> 01:44:36.393
how much more loyal than
she had a right to expect me to be.


1532
01:44:36.477 --> 01:44:39.396
-Eve, don't cry.
-I'm not crying.


1533
01:44:41.232 --> 01:44:45.318
Tell me, how did your luncheon
turn out with the man from Hollywood?


1534
01:44:45.403 --> 01:44:48.154
Some vague promises of a test.

1535
01:44:48.239 --> 01:44:50.657
If a particular part should come along,
one of those things.


1536
01:44:50.741 --> 01:44:55.078
-But the raves about your performance...
-An understudy's performance.


1537
01:44:55.204 --> 01:45:00.000
Well, I think you're painting
the picture a little blacker than it is, really.


1538
01:45:00.084 --> 01:45:04.379
Don't underestimate him.
You have a powerful friend in Addison.


1539
01:45:04.714 --> 01:45:07.257
He's not my friend. 
You were my friends.

1540
01:45:07.341 --> 01:45:10.260
-He can help you.
-I wish I'd never met him.


1541
01:45:10.344 --> 01:45:12.429
I'd like him to be dead.

1542
01:45:12.513 --> 01:45:14.597
I want my friends back.

1543
01:45:15.516 --> 01:45:20.270
Eve. I don't think
you meant to cause unhappiness.


1544
01:45:20.354 --> 01:45:24.607
But you did. More to yourself perhaps,
as it turned out, than to anyone else.


1545
01:45:24.734 --> 01:45:27.861
-I'll never get over it.
-Oh, yes, you will.


1546
01:45:27.945 --> 01:45:32.532
You theatre people always do.
Nothing is forever in the theatre.


1547
01:45:32.616 --> 01:45:36.953
Whatever it is, it's here, it flares up,
burns hot,


1548
01:45:37.038 --> 01:45:39.122
and it's gone.

1549
01:45:39.623 --> 01:45:43.460
-I wish I could believe that.
-Give yourself time.


1550
01:45:43.544 --> 01:45:46.129
Don't worry too much
about what people think.


1551
01:45:46.213 --> 01:45:48.923
You're very young and very talented.

1552
01:45:50.092 --> 01:45:54.471
And, believe it or not,
if there's anything I can do...


1553
01:45:54.555 --> 01:45:56.973
There is something.

1554
01:45:59.393 --> 01:46:03.980
-I think I know.
-Something most important you can do.


1555
01:46:04.315 --> 01:46:08.610
You wanna play Cora. You want me
to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.


1556
01:46:08.819 --> 01:46:11.905
If you told him so, he'd give me
the part. He said he would.


1557
01:46:11.989 --> 01:46:16.826
After all you've said. Don't you know
that part was written for Margo?


1558
01:46:16.911 --> 01:46:19.662
It might've been 15 years ago.
It's my part now.


1559
01:46:19.789 --> 01:46:25.168
-You talk just as Addison said you did.
-Cora is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd.


1560
01:46:25.503 --> 01:46:27.837
Nothing in the world
will make me say that.


1561
01:46:27.922 --> 01:46:29.672
Addison wants me to play it.

1562
01:46:29.799 --> 01:46:32.926
-Over my dead body.
-That won't be necessary.


1563
01:46:33.302 --> 01:46:36.930
Addison knows how Margo
happened to miss that performance,


1564
01:46:37.014 --> 01:46:42.268
how I happened to know she'd miss it
in time to notify every paper in town.


1565
01:46:42.353 --> 01:46:45.772
It's quite a story.
Addison could make quite a thing of it.


1566
01:46:45.856 --> 01:46:47.982
Imagine how snide
and vicious he could get,


1567
01:46:48.067 --> 01:46:50.193
and still tell nothing but the truth.

1568
01:46:50.361 --> 01:46:53.029
I had a time persuading him.

1569
01:46:54.323 --> 01:46:57.450
You better sit down.
You look a bit wobbly.


1570
01:47:01.872 --> 01:47:06.543
If I play Cora, Addison will never
tell what happened, in or out of print.


1571
01:47:06.669 --> 01:47:09.712
A simple exchange of favors.

1572
01:47:09.839 --> 01:47:13.299
I'm so happy I can do something
for you at long last.


1573
01:47:15.469 --> 01:47:17.637
Your friendship with Margo,

1574
01:47:17.721 --> 01:47:20.348
your deep, close friendship.

1575
01:47:20.724 --> 01:47:22.350
What would happen to it

1576
01:47:22.434 --> 01:47:26.312
if she knew the cheap trick
you played on her for my benefit?


1577
01:47:26.397 --> 01:47:30.191
You and Lloyd, how long,
even in the theatre,


1578
01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:35.530
before people forgot what happened
and trusted you again?


1579
01:47:37.533 --> 01:47:39.242
No.

1580
01:47:40.411 --> 01:47:44.747
It would be so much easier for everyone
concerned if I were to play Cora.


1581
01:47:44.874 --> 01:47:47.375
So much better theatre, too.

1582
01:47:48.210 --> 01:47:50.253
A part in a play.

1583
01:47:51.505 --> 01:47:54.841
You'd do all that just
for a part in a play?

1584
01:47:54.925 --> 01:47:57.844
I'd do much more
for a part that good.

1585
01:48:21.118 --> 01:48:23.244
Hungry?

1586
01:48:25.039 --> 01:48:28.708
I'm not surprised, after all that humble pie.

1587
01:48:28.792 --> 01:48:32.629
Nothing of the kind.
Karen and I had a nice talk.


1588
01:48:32.713 --> 01:48:34.797
Heart to heart? 
Woman to woman?

1589
01:48:34.882 --> 01:48:39.552
Including a casual reference to the part
of Cora and your hopes of playing it?


1590
01:48:39.637 --> 01:48:41.804
I discussed it very openly.

1591
01:48:41.889 --> 01:48:44.474
I told her I'd spoken to Lloyd,
and that he was interested.


1592
01:48:44.558 --> 01:48:48.811
And Karen mentioned, of course,
that Margo expects to play the part?


1593
01:48:48.938 --> 01:48:52.732
Oddly enough, she didn't
say a word about Margo.


1594
01:48:52.816 --> 01:48:57.403
Just that she'll be happy to do
what she can to see that I play it.


1595
01:48:58.656 --> 01:49:01.157
Just like that, eh?

1596
01:49:01.283 --> 01:49:03.826
Just like that.

1597
01:49:03.911 --> 01:49:07.789
You know, Eve, sometimes
I think you keep things from me.


1598
01:49:09.124 --> 01:49:12.418
-I don't think that's funny.
-It wasn't meant to be.


1599
01:49:12.503 --> 01:49:16.256
I confide in you and rely on you
more than anyone I've ever known.


1600
01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:19.259
To say a thing like that now,
without any reason,


1601
01:49:19.343 --> 01:49:21.678
when I need you more than ever.

1602
01:49:21.804 --> 01:49:24.347
I hope you mean what you say.

1603
01:49:24.431 --> 01:49:26.933
I intend to hold you to it.

1604
01:49:28.269 --> 01:49:31.354
We have a great deal
in common, it seems to me.


1605
01:49:41.115 --> 01:49:44.867
-Well, what happened?
-Nothing much. She apologized.


1606
01:49:44.994 --> 01:49:46.953
-With tears?
-With tears.


1607
01:49:47.037 --> 01:49:50.957
But not right away. First fight them back,
chin up, stout fellow.


1608
01:49:51.041 --> 01:49:53.543
-Check.
-Very classy. Lots of technique.


1609
01:49:53.627 --> 01:49:58.464
You mean all this time she's done
nothing but apologize? What did you say?


1610
01:49:59.174 --> 01:50:01.217
Not much.

1611
01:50:03.721 --> 01:50:06.639
Groom, may I have a wedding present?

1612
01:50:06.724 --> 01:50:11.144
-What would you like? Texas?
-I want everybody to shut up about Eve.


1613
01:50:11.228 --> 01:50:14.063
Just shut up about Eve. 
That's all I want.

1614
01:50:14.189 --> 01:50:16.316
Give Karen more wine.

1615
01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:18.484
Never have I been so happy.

1616
01:50:18.569 --> 01:50:21.738
Isn't it a lovely room? The Cub Room.

1617
01:50:21.864 --> 01:50:26.159
What a lovely, clever name.
Where the elite meet.


1618
01:50:26.243 --> 01:50:30.580
Never have I seen so much elite,
all with their eyes on me,


1619
01:50:30.706 --> 01:50:35.168
waiting for me to crack that little
gnome on the noggin with a bottle.


1620
01:50:35.252 --> 01:50:39.672
But not tonight. I'm forgiving tonight.
Even Eve. I forgive Eve.


1621
01:50:40.674 --> 01:50:43.009
There they go.

1622
01:50:44.178 --> 01:50:45.845
There goes Eve.

1623
01:50:45.929 --> 01:50:49.057
Eve Evil, little Miss Evil.

1624
01:50:50.351 --> 01:50:53.269
But "the evil that men do..."
How does that go, groom?


1625
01:50:53.395 --> 01:50:55.855
Something about the good
they leave behind.


1626
01:50:55.939 --> 01:50:58.274
I played it once in rep in Wilkes
-Barre.

1627
01:50:58.359 --> 01:51:01.110
You've got it backwards,
even for Wilkes-Barre.


1628
01:51:01.195 --> 01:51:04.864
Do you know why I forgive Eve?
She left good behind.


1629
01:51:05.115 --> 01:51:09.535
The four of us here together,
it's Eve fault. I forgive her.


1630
01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:14.457
And Bill, especially Bill. 
She did that too.

1631
01:51:14.875 --> 01:51:17.210
You know, she probably
means well after all.


1632
01:51:17.294 --> 01:51:20.755
-She is a louse.
-Never try to outguess Margo.


1633
01:51:21.423 --> 01:51:23.633
-Groom?
-Yes, dear.


1634
01:51:23.759 --> 01:51:26.052
-Do you know what I'm going to be?
-A cowboy?


1635
01:51:26.136 --> 01:51:29.222
-A married lady.
-With a paper to prove it.


1636
01:51:29.306 --> 01:51:33.142
I'm going to look up at six o'clock,
and there he'll be.


1637
01:51:33.811 --> 01:51:36.604
-Remember, Karen?
-I remember.


1638
01:51:37.481 --> 01:51:41.484
-You'll be there, won't you?
-Often enough to keep the franchise.


1639
01:51:41.568 --> 01:51:44.237
No more make-believe, offstage or on.

1640
01:51:44.488 --> 01:51:47.073
Remember, Lloyd? 
I mean it now.

1641
01:51:47.157 --> 01:51:50.326
Lloyd, will you promise
not to be angry with me?


1642
01:51:50.994 --> 01:51:53.788
-That depends.
-No, I mean deeply angry.


1643
01:51:53.997 --> 01:51:56.249
I don't think I could be.

1644
01:51:56.333 --> 01:51:59.335
Well, I don't want to play Cora.

1645
01:51:59.670 --> 01:52:02.922
-What?
-You're always so touchy about his plays.


1646
01:52:03.006 --> 01:52:07.427
It isn't the part. It's a great part
and a fine play. But not for me anymore.


1647
01:52:07.511 --> 01:52:11.848
Not for a foursquare, upright,
downright, forthright, married lady.


1648
01:52:12.099 --> 01:52:14.434
What's your being married
got to do with it?


1649
01:52:14.518 --> 01:52:17.854
It means I've finally
got a life to live.

1650
01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:20.857
I don't have to play
parts I'm too old for

1651
01:52:20.983 --> 01:52:24.360
just because I've got
nothing to do with my nights.


1652
01:52:25.279 --> 01:52:27.864
Oh, Lloyd, I'll make it
up to you, believe me.

1653
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:32.869
I'll tour a year with this one, anything.
Only you do understand, don't you?


1654
01:52:39.835 --> 01:52:42.295
-What's so funny?
-Nothing.


1655
01:52:42.713 --> 01:52:46.215
-Nothing?
-Everything. Everything's so funny.


1656
01:52:58.228 --> 01:53:00.897
Lloyd never got around to asking

1657
01:53:00.981 --> 01:53:05.067
whether it was all right with me
for Eve to play Cora.


1658
01:53:05.152 --> 01:53:10.239
Bill, oddly enough, refused to direct
the play at first, with Eve in it.


1659
01:53:10.324 --> 01:53:13.075
Lloyd and Max finally won him over.

1660
01:53:13.202 --> 01:53:15.161
Margo never came to rehearsal.

1661
01:53:15.245 --> 01:53:19.248
"Too much to do around the house,"
she said.


1662
01:53:19.374 --> 01:53:23.336
I'd never known Bill and Lloyd
to fight as bitterly and often,


1663
01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:26.088
and always over some business for Eve,

1664
01:53:26.173 --> 01:53:29.592
or a move, or the
way she read a speech.

1665
01:53:29.843 --> 01:53:33.596
But I'd never known Lloyd
to meddle as much with Bill's directing,


1666
01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:36.933
as far as it affected Eve, that is.

1667
01:53:37.059 --> 01:53:39.685
Somehow Eve kept them going.

1668
01:53:39.770 --> 01:53:43.272
Bill stuck it out. 
Lloyd seemed happy.

1669
01:53:47.194 --> 01:53:51.531
And I thought it might be best
if I skipped rehearsals from then on.


1670
01:53:53.242 --> 01:53:57.537
It seemed to me I had known always
that it would happen. And here it was.


1671
01:53:57.621 --> 01:54:02.542
I felt helpless. That helplessness you
feel when you have no talent to offer,


1672
01:54:02.626 --> 01:54:04.877
outside of loving your husband.

1673
01:54:04.962 --> 01:54:08.965
How could I compete?
Everything Lloyd loved about me,


1674
01:54:09.049 --> 01:54:11.133
he'd gotten used to long ago.

1675
01:54:16.723 --> 01:54:18.224
Hello?

1676
01:54:18.308 --> 01:54:20.643
Who? Who's calling Mr. Richards?

1677
01:54:20.727 --> 01:54:24.814
My name wouldn't mean anything.
I room across the hall from Eve Harrington.


1678
01:54:24.940 --> 01:54:28.484
She isn't well. She's been crying
all night and she's hysterical.


1679
01:54:28.569 --> 01:54:30.736
She doesn't want a doctor and...

1680
01:54:31.154 --> 01:54:33.239
Who is it? What's it all about?

1681
01:54:33.323 --> 01:54:37.827
-Did Miss Harrington tell you to call?
-Oh, no. Eve didn't say to call him.


1682
01:54:37.953 --> 01:54:41.247
I saw Mr. Richards with her
a couple of times.


1683
01:54:41.331 --> 01:54:43.332
I thought, they being such good friends...

1684
01:54:43.458 --> 01:54:46.586
This is Lloyd Richards.
Where is Eve? Let me talk to her.


1685
01:54:46.670 --> 01:54:50.006
Hello, Mr. Richards.
She's upstairs in her room.


1686
01:54:50.090 --> 01:54:53.843
I really hate to bother you this way,
but the way Eve's been feeling,


1687
01:54:53.969 --> 01:54:57.763
I've been worried sick, what with
her leaving tomorrow for New Haven.


1688
01:54:57.848 --> 01:55:00.933
Tell her not to worry.
Tell her I'll be right over.


1689
01:55:19.494 --> 01:55:22.872
To the theatre world,
New Haven, Connecticut,


1690
01:55:22.956 --> 01:55:27.793
is a short stretch of sidewalk between
the Shubert Theatre and the Taft Hotel,


1691
01:55:27.878 --> 01:55:31.380
surrounded by what looks
very much like a small city.


1692
01:55:31.506 --> 01:55:36.469
It is here that managers have
what are called out-of-town openings,


1693
01:55:36.553 --> 01:55:40.848
which are openings for New Yorkers
who want to go out of town.


1694
01:55:41.558 --> 01:55:44.894
What a day. What a heavenly day.

1695
01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:48.064
-D-day.
-Just like it.


1696
01:55:48.190 --> 01:55:50.107
Tomorrow morning,
you will have won your beachhead


1697
01:55:50.192 --> 01:55:52.485
on the shores of immortality.

1698
01:55:52.569 --> 01:55:54.695
Stop rehearsing your column.

1699
01:55:55.656 --> 01:55:57.657
Isn’t it strange, Addison?

1700
01:55:57.741 --> 01:56:01.952
I thought I'd be panic-stricken,
want to run away or something.


1701
01:56:02.037 --> 01:56:06.248
Instead, I can't wait for tonight
to come. To come and go.


1702
01:56:06.416 --> 01:56:08.668
Are you that sure of tomorrow?

1703
01:56:08.752 --> 01:56:11.420
-Aren't you?
-Frankly, yes.


1704
01:56:18.011 --> 01:56:20.096
It'll be a night to remember.

1705
01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:22.932
It'll bring me everything I've ever wanted.

1706
01:56:23.016 --> 01:56:25.685
The end of an old road,
the beginning of a new one.


1707
01:56:25.769 --> 01:56:30.022
-All paved with diamonds and gold?
-You know me better than that.


1708
01:56:30.107 --> 01:56:32.191
Paved with what, then?

1709
01:56:33.110 --> 01:56:35.194
Stars.

1710
01:56:36.279 --> 01:56:38.280
What time?

1711
01:56:38.365 --> 01:56:40.449
Almost four.

1712
01:56:41.034 --> 01:56:43.369
Plenty of time for a nice, long nap.

1713
01:56:43.453 --> 01:56:45.955
We rehearsed most of last night.

1714
01:56:46.081 --> 01:56:48.290
You could sleep now, couldn't you?

1715
01:56:48.375 --> 01:56:51.460
-Why not?
-The mark of a true killer.


1716
01:56:52.421 --> 01:56:55.631
Sleep tight, rest easy
and come out fighting.


1717
01:56:55.716 --> 01:56:58.467
Why did you call me a killer?

1718
01:56:58.552 --> 01:57:02.805
Did I say killer? I meant champion.
I get my boxing terms mixed.


1719
01:57:04.099 --> 01:57:07.476
Addison, come in for a minute, will you?

1720
01:57:07.561 --> 01:57:10.062
I've got something to tell you.

1721
01:57:19.948 --> 01:57:23.242
Suites are for expense accounts.
You're being extravagant.


1722
01:57:23.326 --> 01:57:28.164
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd
had a terrific row, but Lloyd insisted.


1723
01:57:29.124 --> 01:57:33.919
-Can I fix you a drink?
-With the reluctant compliments of Max?


1724
01:57:34.004 --> 01:57:36.505
Lloyd. I never have any.

1725
01:57:36.590 --> 01:57:39.842
He likes a few drinks after we finish,
so he sent it up.


1726
01:57:39.968 --> 01:57:44.013
Some plain soda. Lloyd must be
expecting a record run in New Haven.


1727
01:57:44.139 --> 01:57:47.600
That's for tonight. 
You're invited.

1728
01:57:47.684 --> 01:57:50.936
We're having everyone up
after the performance.


1729
01:57:51.021 --> 01:57:53.022
"We are?"

1730
01:57:53.148 --> 01:57:55.191
Lloyd and I.

1731
01:57:56.443 --> 01:57:59.361
I find it odd that Karen
isn't here for the opening.


1732
01:57:59.446 --> 01:58:02.031
-Addison...
-She was always so devoted to Lloyd.


1733
01:58:02.115 --> 01:58:04.325
One would think only death
could keep her...


1734
01:58:04.409 --> 01:58:05.868
Addison.

1735
01:58:05.994 --> 01:58:12.541
I said this would be a night to remember,
that it would bring me all I ever wanted.


1736
01:58:12.626 --> 01:58:14.418
Oh, yes.
Something about an old road ending


1737
01:58:14.503 --> 01:58:17.213
and a new one starting,
all paved with stars.


1738
01:58:17.339 --> 01:58:19.882
I didn't mean just the theatre.

1739
01:58:19.966 --> 01:58:22.051
What else?

1740
01:58:24.805 --> 01:58:27.348
Lloyd Richards.

1741
01:58:27.724 --> 01:58:31.352
He's going to leave Karen.
We're going to be married.


1742
01:58:32.687 --> 01:58:35.648
So that's it. Lloyd.

1743
01:58:35.732 --> 01:58:38.484
Still just the theatre, after all.

1744
01:58:38.568 --> 01:58:40.569
It's nothing of the kind.

1745
01:58:40.654 --> 01:58:42.863
Lloyd loves me. I love him.

1746
01:58:43.073 --> 01:58:44.782
I know nothing of Lloyd's loves.

1747
01:58:44.866 --> 01:58:47.409
I leave those to Louisa May Alcott.
But I know you.


1748
01:58:47.536 --> 01:58:49.245
I'm in love with Lloyd.

1749
01:58:49.329 --> 01:58:52.414
He is a commercially
successful playwright.


1750
01:58:52.749 --> 01:58:56.335
-You have no right to say that.
-And, artistically, very promising.


1751
01:58:56.419 --> 01:58:58.712
Eve, dear, this is Addison.

1752
01:59:01.007 --> 01:59:03.259
Oh, Addison, won't it be just perfect?

1753
01:59:03.343 --> 01:59:06.846
Lloyd and I.
There's no telling how far we can go.


1754
01:59:06.930 --> 01:59:10.516
He'll write great plays for me.
I'll make them great.


1755
01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:13.519
You're the only one who knows,
except Lloyd and me.


1756
01:59:13.603 --> 01:59:15.688
-And Karen.
-She doesn't know.


1757
01:59:15.772 --> 01:59:18.774
-She knows enough not to be here.
-But not all of it.


1758
01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:22.027
-Not that Lloyd and I are gonna be married.
-I see.


1759
01:59:22.445 --> 01:59:25.781
And when was this unholy alliance joined?

1760
01:59:25.866 --> 01:59:29.368
We decided night before last,
before we came up here.


1761
01:59:29.452 --> 01:59:32.705
I trust the setting was properly romantic.

1762
01:59:32.789 --> 01:59:36.458
Lights on dimmers
and gypsy violins offstage.


1763
01:59:36.585 --> 01:59:38.961
The setting wasn't romantic,

1764
01:59:39.087 --> 01:59:41.130
but Lloyd was.

1765
01:59:41.214 --> 01:59:44.550
He woke me up at three o'clock
in the morning, banging on my door.


1766
01:59:44.634 --> 01:59:48.137
He couldn't sleep, he said. 
He'd left Karen.

1767
01:59:48.263 --> 01:59:52.808
Couldn't go on with the play or anything
else until I promised to marry him.


1768
01:59:52.893 --> 01:59:55.811
We sat and talked until it was light.

1769
01:59:55.896 --> 01:59:58.230
He never went home.

1770
01:59:58.315 --> 02:00:02.735
-You sat and talked until it was light?
-We sat and talked, Addison.


1771
02:00:03.737 --> 02:00:06.280
I want a run-of-the-play contract.

1772
02:00:07.908 --> 02:00:12.077
There never was, and there
never will be, another like you.


1773
02:00:13.330 --> 02:00:15.664
Well, say something. Anything.

1774
02:00:15.749 --> 02:00:18.417
Congratulations. Skål. Good work, Eve.

1775
02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:27.384
What do you take me for?

1776
02:00:27.469 --> 02:00:30.012
I don't know
that I "take you" for anything.


1777
02:00:30.096 --> 02:00:33.265
Is it possible that you've confused me

1778
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:36.518
with those backward children
you've played tricks on?


1779
02:00:36.603 --> 02:00:39.438
That you have the same contempt
for me as for them?


1780
02:00:39.522 --> 02:00:42.191
I'm sure you mean something,
but I don't know what.


1781
02:00:42.317 --> 02:00:44.860
Look closely, Eve. 
It's time you did.

1782
02:00:45.362 --> 02:00:49.990
I am Addison DeWitt.
I'm nobody's fool, least of all yours.


1783
02:00:50.283 --> 02:00:54.453
-I never intended you to be.
-Yes, you did, and you still do.


1784
02:00:54.537 --> 02:00:58.207
I don't know what you mean.
But I want to take my nap. It's important...


1785
02:00:58.291 --> 02:01:02.127
-It's important that we talk, killer to killer.
-Champion to champion.


1786
02:01:02.212 --> 02:01:05.214
Not with me, you're no champion.
You're stepping up.


1787
02:01:05.298 --> 02:01:08.008
Please say what you have to say,
plainly and distinctly,


1788
02:01:08.093 --> 02:01:09.635
and then let me take my nap.

1789
02:01:09.719 --> 02:01:15.557
Very well. Although it's unnecessary,
because you know what I'm going to say.


1790
02:01:15.642 --> 02:01:19.478
Lloyd may leave Karen,
but he will not leave Karen for you.


1791
02:01:19.562 --> 02:01:23.899
-What do you mean by that?
-More plainly and more distinctly?


1792
02:01:23.984 --> 02:01:27.569
I have not come to New Haven
to see the play, discuss your dreams,


1793
02:01:27.696 --> 02:01:30.489
or pull the ivy
from the walls of Yale.

1794
02:01:30.573 --> 02:01:34.326
I came to tell you that you will
not marry Lloyd, or anyone else,


1795
02:01:34.411 --> 02:01:36.495
because I will not permit it.

1796
02:01:36.579 --> 02:01:39.206
-What have you got to do with it?
-Everything.


1797
02:01:39.541 --> 02:01:42.918
Because after tonight
you will belong to me.


1798
02:01:43.003 --> 02:01:46.422
Belong? To you?

1799
02:01:47.382 --> 02:01:49.425
I can't believe my ears.

1800
02:01:49.551 --> 02:01:51.510
A dull cliché.

1801
02:01:51.594 --> 02:01:53.762
"Belong" to you?

1802
02:01:53.847 --> 02:01:57.099
That sounds medieval.
Something out of an old melodrama.


1803
02:01:57.183 --> 02:02:00.352
So does the history of the world
for the past 20 years.


1804
02:02:00.437 --> 02:02:02.521
I don't enjoy putting it this bluntly.

1805
02:02:02.605 --> 02:02:06.108
I'd hoped that you would have
taken it for granted that you and I...


1806
02:02:06.234 --> 02:02:08.277
"Taken it for granted?"

1807
02:02:08.403 --> 02:02:10.446
"That you and I...?"

1808
02:02:15.535 --> 02:02:18.704
Now remember, as long as you live,
never to laugh at me.


1809
02:02:18.788 --> 02:02:21.790
At anything or anyone else,
but never at me.


1810
02:02:25.295 --> 02:02:29.214
-Get out.
-You're too short for that gesture.


1811
02:02:29.299 --> 02:02:31.800
Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.

1812
02:02:32.969 --> 02:02:36.138
Then if you won't get out,
I'll have you thrown out.


1813
02:02:36.222 --> 02:02:39.224
Don't pick up that phone.
Don't even touch it.


1814
02:02:39.309 --> 02:02:41.810
Something told you to do
what I said, didn't it?


1815
02:02:41.895 --> 02:02:45.731
That instinct is worth millions.
You can't buy it, Eve. Cherish it.


1816
02:02:45.815 --> 02:02:49.276
When that alarm goes off,
go to your battle stations.


1817
02:02:50.487 --> 02:02:55.157
To begin with, your name is not Eve
Harrington. It's Gertrude Slescynski.


1818
02:02:55.241 --> 02:02:56.366
What of it?

1819
02:02:56.451 --> 02:02:59.078
True, your parents were poor,
and still are.


1820
02:02:59.162 --> 02:03:01.413
They would like to know how you are.

1821
02:03:01.498 --> 02:03:03.916
They haven't heard from you
for three years.


1822
02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.085
What of it?

1823
02:03:06.753 --> 02:03:08.837
A matter of opinion, granted.

1824
02:03:08.963 --> 02:03:11.423
It's also true you worked in a brewery.

1825
02:03:11.508 --> 02:03:15.177
But life there was not as dull
as you pictured it.


1826
02:03:15.261 --> 02:03:20.099
It got less and less dull, until your boss's
wife had your boss followed by detectives.


1827
02:03:20.183 --> 02:03:24.103
-She never proved a thing!
-But the $500 you got to get out of town


1828
02:03:24.187 --> 02:03:27.439
brought you straight to New York,
didn't it?


1829
02:03:35.698 --> 02:03:38.367
That $500 brought you
straight to New York.


1830
02:03:38.451 --> 02:03:40.369
She was a liar. 
She was a liar!

1831
02:03:40.453 --> 02:03:44.123
Answer my question.
Weren't you paid to get out of town?


1832
02:03:47.377 --> 02:03:50.879
There was no Eddie, no pilot.
You've never been married.


1833
02:03:51.089 --> 02:03:53.966
That was not only a lie,
it was an insult to dead heroes


1834
02:03:54.050 --> 02:03:56.093
and the women who loved them.

1835
02:03:56.177 --> 02:04:00.389
San Francisco has no Shubert Theatre.
You've never been to San Francisco.


1836
02:04:00.515 --> 02:04:04.143
That was a stupid lie, easy to expose,
not worthy of you.


1837
02:04:04.227 --> 02:04:06.186
I had to get in to meet Margo.

1838
02:04:06.271 --> 02:04:09.398
I had to say something, be somebody.
Make her like me!


1839
02:04:09.482 --> 02:04:11.817
She did like you.
She helped and trusted you.


1840
02:04:11.901 --> 02:04:14.820
-You repaid her by trying to win Bill.
-That's not true!


1841
02:04:14.904 --> 02:04:19.074
I was there. I saw you and heard you
through the dressing-room door.


1842
02:04:19.909 --> 02:04:23.579
You used my name to blackmail Karen
into getting you the part of Cora.


1843
02:04:23.663 --> 02:04:26.748
-You lied to me about it.
-No!


1844
02:04:26.916 --> 02:04:29.668
I had lunch with Karen
not three hours ago.


1845
02:04:29.752 --> 02:04:34.756
As always with women who try to find out
things, she told more than she learnt.


1846
02:04:35.550 --> 02:04:37.050
Now do you want to change your story

1847
02:04:37.135 --> 02:04:39.845
about Lloyd beating at your door
that night?


1848
02:04:39.929 --> 02:04:41.763
Please, please.

1849
02:04:46.352 --> 02:04:51.523
That I should want you at all suddenly
strikes me as the height of improbability.


1850
02:04:51.608 --> 02:04:55.277
But that in itself is probably the reason.

1851
02:04:55.361 --> 02:05:00.199
You're an improbable person, Eve,
and so am I. We have that in common.


1852
02:05:00.283 --> 02:05:04.620
Also a contempt for humanity,
an inability to love and be loved.


1853
02:05:04.704 --> 02:05:08.457
Insatiable ambition and talent.

1854
02:05:08.583 --> 02:05:12.044
We deserve each other.
Are you listening to me?


1855
02:05:14.297 --> 02:05:17.257
-Then say so.
-Yes, Addison.


1856
02:05:17.550 --> 02:05:21.595
And you realize and you agree
how completely you belong to me?


1857
02:05:22.055 --> 02:05:23.639
Yes, Addison.

1858
02:05:24.307 --> 02:05:27.643
Then take your nap,
and good luck for tonight.


1859
02:05:32.815 --> 02:05:34.900
I won't play tonight.

1860
02:05:34.984 --> 02:05:39.571
I couldn't. Not possibly. 
I couldn't go on.

1861
02:05:39.656 --> 02:05:43.909
"Couldn't go on"?
You'll give the performance of your life.


1862
02:06:02.595 --> 02:06:05.597
And she gave the performance of her life.

1863
02:06:05.682 --> 02:06:08.433
And it was a
night to remember, that night.

1864
02:06:18.528 --> 02:06:21.697
Honored members of
the Sarah Siddons Society,


1865
02:06:21.781 --> 02:06:25.200
distinguished guests,
ladies and gentlemen.


1866
02:06:26.536 --> 02:06:28.954
What is there for me to say?

1867
02:06:29.038 --> 02:06:32.541
Everything wise and witty
has long since been said


1868
02:06:32.625 --> 02:06:37.045
by minds more mature
and talents far greater than mine.


1869
02:06:37.171 --> 02:06:40.632
For me to thank you as equals
would be presumptuous.


1870
02:06:40.717 --> 02:06:43.218
I am an apprentice in the theatre,

1871
02:06:43.344 --> 02:06:46.471
and have much to
learn from all of you.

1872
02:06:46.556 --> 02:06:50.225
Let me say only that
I am proud and happy,

1873
02:06:51.185 --> 02:06:54.229
and that I regard this great honor

1874
02:06:54.314 --> 02:06:57.482
not so much as an award
for what I have achieved,


1875
02:06:57.567 --> 02:07:00.986
but as a standard to hold against
what I have yet to accomplish.


1876
02:07:03.239 --> 02:07:08.243
And, further, that I regard it
as bestowed upon me only in part.


1877
02:07:09.412 --> 02:07:13.915
The larger share belongs
to my friends in the theatre,


1878
02:07:14.042 --> 02:07:16.585
and to the theatre itself

1879
02:07:16.711 --> 02:07:19.588
which has given me all I have.

1880
02:07:21.049 --> 02:07:25.218
In good conscience,
I must give credit where credit is due.


1881
02:07:26.721 --> 02:07:30.349
To Max Fabian. Dear Max.

1882
02:07:30.850 --> 02:07:35.020
Dear sentimental, generous,
courageous Max Fabian,


1883
02:07:35.104 --> 02:07:38.940
who took a chance on
an unknown, untried amateur.


1884
02:07:43.613 --> 02:07:47.199
To my first friend in the theatre,

1885
02:07:47.283 --> 02:07:51.203
whose kindness and graciousness
I shall never forget,


1886
02:07:51.287 --> 02:07:53.789
Karen. Mrs. Lloyd Richards.

1887
02:07:59.962 --> 02:08:03.965
It was Karen who first brought me
to one whom I'd always idolized,


1888
02:08:04.050 --> 02:08:07.386
one who became
my benefactress and champion.


1889
02:08:08.596 --> 02:08:12.432
A great actress and a great woman,

1890
02:08:12.809 --> 02:08:14.351
Margo Channing.

1891
02:08:19.816 --> 02:08:22.234
To my director,

1892
02:08:22.318 --> 02:08:27.239
who demanded always a little more
than my talent could provide,


1893
02:08:27.323 --> 02:08:30.075
but who taught me patiently and well,

1894
02:08:31.661 --> 02:08:33.120
Bill Sampson.

1895
02:08:36.582 --> 02:08:40.669
And one without whose
great play and faith in me,


1896
02:08:41.337 --> 02:08:44.172
this night could never have been.

1897
02:08:44.257 --> 02:08:46.550
How can I repay Lloyd Richards?

1898
02:08:49.512 --> 02:08:51.847
How can I repay the many others,

1899
02:08:51.973 --> 02:08:55.016
so many,
I couldn't possibly name them all,


1900
02:08:55.143 --> 02:08:58.186
whose help, guidance, and advice

1901
02:08:59.772 --> 02:09:04.860
have made this, the happiest
night of my life, possible.


1902
02:09:09.282 --> 02:09:13.285
Although I am going to Hollywood
next week to make a film,


1903
02:09:13.369 --> 02:09:16.705
do not think for a moment
that I am leaving you.


1904
02:09:16.789 --> 02:09:18.957
How could I?

1905
02:09:19.041 --> 02:09:21.877
My heart is here in the theatre,

1906
02:09:22.003 --> 02:09:26.465
and 3,000 miles are too far
to be away from one's heart.


1907
02:09:26.549 --> 02:09:29.551
I'll be back to claim it, and soon.

1908
02:09:31.304 --> 02:09:35.223
That is, if you want me back.

1909
02:09:41.731 --> 02:09:44.983
Good night to you all,
and to all, a good night.


1910
02:09:52.575 --> 02:09:57.078
For services rendered beyond
whatever it is of duty, darling.


1911
02:10:01.876 --> 02:10:07.172
Come on, I'm the host. I got to get home
before my guests start stealing the liquor.


1912
02:10:09.926 --> 02:10:12.761
-Congratulations, Eve.
-Thank you, Karen.


1913
02:10:16.057 --> 02:10:20.018
-Congratulations, Miss Harrington.
-Oh, thank you so much.


1914
02:10:20.937 --> 02:10:25.690
Nice speech, Eve. But I wouldn't worry
too much about your heart.


1915
02:10:25.775 --> 02:10:29.569
You can always put that award
where your heart ought to be.


1916
02:10:32.073 --> 02:10:34.115
I don't suppose there's a drink left?

1917
02:10:34.242 --> 02:10:37.035
-You can have one at Max's.
-I don't think I'm going.


1918
02:10:37.119 --> 02:10:41.122
-Why not?
-Because I don't want to.


1919
02:10:41.249 --> 02:10:44.793
-I'm so happy for you, Eve.
-Thank you so much.


1920
02:10:46.295 --> 02:10:47.879
Max has gone to a lot of trouble.

1921
02:10:47.964 --> 02:10:51.383
This is going to be an elaborate party
and it's for you.


1922
02:10:51.467 --> 02:10:54.970
No, it isn't. It's for this.

1923
02:10:55.096 --> 02:10:57.806
-It's the same thing, isn't it?
-Exactly.


1924
02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:01.977
Here, take it to
the party instead of me.

1925
02:11:02.061 --> 02:11:04.312
You're being very childish.

1926
02:11:04.397 --> 02:11:08.567
-I'm tired. I want to go home.
-Very well. I'll drop you off.


1927
02:11:08.651 --> 02:11:12.320
I shall go to the party alone.
I have no intention of missing it.


1928
02:12:38.866 --> 02:12:40.992
-Who are you?
-Miss Harrington.


1929
02:12:41.077 --> 02:12:44.871
-What are you doing here?
-I... I guess I fell asleep.


1930
02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.087
Please don't have me arrested.
I didn't steal anything. You can search me.


1931
02:12:52.171 --> 02:12:56.091
-How did you get in here?
-I hid outside till the maid came in.


1932
02:12:56.217 --> 02:12:59.010
She went out to get something
and left the door open.


1933
02:12:59.095 --> 02:13:03.181
I sneaked in and hid till she'd finished.
Then I just looked around.


1934
02:13:03.265 --> 02:13:07.018
I was afraid someone would notice
the lights were on, so I turned them off.


1935
02:13:07.103 --> 02:13:10.689
-Then I guess I fell asleep.
-You were just looking around?


1936
02:13:10.773 --> 02:13:12.691
-That's all.
-What for?


1937
02:13:12.775 --> 02:13:15.443
-You probably won't believe me.
-Probably not.


1938
02:13:15.569 --> 02:13:18.029
-It was for my report.
-What report? To whom?


1939
02:13:18.114 --> 02:13:20.949
About how you live,
what kind of clothes you wear,


1940
02:13:21.075 --> 02:13:25.203
what kind of perfume
and books, things like that.


1941
02:13:25.287 --> 02:13:29.290
You know the Eve Harrington Club that
they have in most girls' high schools?


1942
02:13:29.417 --> 02:13:33.378
-I've heard of them.
-Ours was one of the first, Erasmus Hall.


1943
02:13:33.462 --> 02:13:37.799
-I'm the president.
-Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?


1944
02:13:37.883 --> 02:13:42.303
Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn.
Barbara Stanwyck and Susan Hayward.


1945
02:13:42.388 --> 02:13:44.806
Of course, they're just movie stars.

1946
02:13:44.890 --> 02:13:47.559
You're going to Hollywood, aren't you?

1947
02:13:47.643 --> 02:13:48.810
Mm-hm.

1948
02:13:48.978 --> 02:13:52.647
From the trunks you're packing,
you must be going to stay a long time.


1949
02:13:52.732 --> 02:13:54.816
I might.

1950
02:13:58.821 --> 02:14:01.740
That spilled drink's gonna ruin your carpet.

1951
02:14:01.824 --> 02:14:04.325
Maid'll fix it in the morning.

1952
02:14:05.244 --> 02:14:08.163
-I'll just clean up the mess.
-Don't bother.


1953
02:14:08.998 --> 02:14:12.083
-How'd you get up here from Brooklyn?
-Subway.


1954
02:14:13.169 --> 02:14:15.420
How long does it take?

1955
02:14:15.504 --> 02:14:18.423
With changing and everything,
a little over an hour.


1956
02:14:18.507 --> 02:14:22.177
It's after one now.
You won't get home till all hours.


1957
02:14:24.013 --> 02:14:26.097
I don't care if I never get home.

1958
02:14:28.476 --> 02:14:30.518
That's the door.

1959
02:14:33.647 --> 02:14:35.690
You rest. I'll get it.

1960
02:14:43.866 --> 02:14:46.201
Hello. Who are you?

1961
02:14:47.036 --> 02:14:51.039
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. DeWitt.
She asked me to see who it is.


1962
02:14:51.165 --> 02:14:53.208
Well, we won't disturb her rest.

1963
02:14:53.334 --> 02:14:58.463
It seems Miss Harrington left her award
in the taxi cab. Will you give it to her?


1964
02:14:59.715 --> 02:15:02.717
Tell me, how did you know my name?

1965
02:15:03.511 --> 02:15:06.221
It's a very famous name, Mr. DeWitt.

1966
02:15:06.305 --> 02:15:08.723
-And what's your name?
-Phoebe.


1967
02:15:09.391 --> 02:15:12.393
-Phoebe?
-I call myself Phoebe.


1968
02:15:13.729 --> 02:15:15.647
And why not?

1969
02:15:15.731 --> 02:15:21.069
Tell me, Phoebe, do you want someday
to have an award like that of your own?


1970
02:15:21.153 --> 02:15:26.574
-More than anything else in the world.
-Then ask Miss Harrington how to get one.


1971
02:15:27.743 --> 02:15:30.662
Miss Harrington knows all about it.

1972
02:15:39.213 --> 02:15:41.339
Who was it?

1973
02:15:41.423 --> 02:15:43.591
Just a taxi driver, 
Miss Harrington.

1974
02:15:43.717 --> 02:15:47.595
You left your award in his cab,
and he brought it back.


1975
02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:51.683
Put it on one of the trunks,
will you? I wanna pack it.


1976
02:15:51.767 --> 02:15:53.893
Sure, Miss Harrington.
