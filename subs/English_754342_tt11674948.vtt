2
00:00:29.673 --> 00:00:31.008
We can do better.

3
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.577
Again.

4
00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:46.756
Bye.

5
00:08:43.267 --> 00:08:44.134
Hm.

6
00:10:56.767 --> 00:10:59.236
Yes!

7
00:11:21.425 --> 00:11:22.793
Hey!

8
00:11:22.826 --> 00:11:23.962
What're you doing?

9
00:11:23.995 --> 00:11:24.861
Hey!

10
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.866
Stop!

11
00:11:33.938 --> 00:11:34.771
Hey!

12
00:11:37.341 --> 00:11:38.208
Hey!

13
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.154
You can't just go around

14
00:11:51.188 --> 00:11:53.457
taking people's
things, you little...


15
00:11:57.861 --> 00:11:58.895
You little girl.

16
00:12:07.838 --> 00:12:09.139
I'm not gonna hurt you.

17
00:12:12.643 --> 00:12:16.246
But you need to learn how
to leave strangers alone.


18
00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:17.347
You understand?

19
00:12:19.182 --> 00:12:20.484
I'm not some charity.

20
00:12:22.719 --> 00:12:26.124
You need to go back to wherever
it is that you came from.


21
00:12:26.156 --> 00:12:27.224
Leave me alone.

22
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.264
Good talk.

23
00:12:50.948 --> 00:12:51.882
Now, go on!

24
00:12:53.684 --> 00:12:54.551
Get!

25
00:13:45.169 --> 00:13:46.336
What?

26
00:13:46.369 --> 00:13:47.939
What? What is it?
What do you want?


27
00:13:51.374 --> 00:13:54.277
I told you. I'm
not gonna hurt you.


28
00:13:55.445 --> 00:13:58.248
But saying somethin'.
Tell me your name.


29
00:13:58.281 --> 00:14:00.517
Tell me why you're out
here all by yourself.


30
00:14:02.452 --> 00:14:05.123
Somebody's gotta
be looking for you.


31
00:14:05.156 --> 00:14:07.290
Where's your mommy?
Where's your daddy?


32
00:14:08.926 --> 00:14:09.793
Nobody?

33
00:14:11.361 --> 00:14:12.429
You're just here.

34
00:14:17.034 --> 00:14:18.635
What're you up to?

35
00:14:30.081 --> 00:14:31.648
Well, I can't just
leave you here.


36
00:14:36.686 --> 00:14:37.554
Come with me.

37
00:14:41.225 --> 00:14:42.292
Come on.

38
00:14:49.033 --> 00:14:51.601
This is what I always wanted!

39
00:15:19.563 --> 00:15:20.530
So what in the holy hell

40
00:15:20.564 --> 00:15:22.699
are you doing out
here all alone, huh?


41
00:15:25.136 --> 00:15:26.003
Huh?

42
00:15:26.971 --> 00:15:28.072
Come on, kid. Cut the silence.

43
00:15:28.105 --> 00:15:30.041
Say something, will
you? What's your name?


44
00:15:33.044 --> 00:15:33.978
Hi, I'm Jack.

45
00:15:42.352 --> 00:15:44.788
I bet you're pretty,
pretty thirsty, huh?


46
00:15:46.823 --> 00:15:47.691
Yeah.

47
00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:54.497
Well, I will let you have some
of the water from my canteen


48
00:15:54.531 --> 00:15:56.366
if you ask for it nicely.

49
00:15:58.869 --> 00:16:00.104
Please.

50
00:16:03.007 --> 00:16:04.641
That's "please", right?

51
00:16:04.674 --> 00:16:05.542
Yeah?

52
00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:08.279
Okay.

53
00:16:08.312 --> 00:16:09.914
I took a little sign language.

54
00:16:11.414 --> 00:16:13.951
Back in school, but that
was a little while ago.


55
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.595
Let's see if we can
figure this out, huh?


56
00:16:27.497 --> 00:16:31.701
I was always better
at understanding


57
00:16:36.207 --> 00:16:38.075
So, tell me, why
don't you talk, huh?


58
00:16:40.278 --> 00:16:41.913
What's your name?

59
00:16:41.946 --> 00:16:43.014
No name.

60
00:16:43.047 --> 00:16:44.081
You don't have a name?

61
00:16:45.049 --> 00:16:46.183
Everybody's got a name.

62
00:16:57.028 --> 00:16:57.894
Hey.

63
00:16:59.196 --> 00:17:00.064
I got an idea.

64
00:17:02.799 --> 00:17:04.969
Why don't you come with me?

65
00:17:05.002 --> 00:17:06.203
Yeah.

66
00:17:06.237 --> 00:17:07.637
You can bring the water.

67
00:17:07.671 --> 00:17:10.374
I think I know something
that'll cheer you up.


68
00:17:10.408 --> 00:17:11.474
Hey, come on.

69
00:17:46.978 --> 00:17:47.877
Here, look.

70
00:17:51.382 --> 00:17:52.515
Watch that.

71
00:19:06.424 --> 00:19:08.025
Can't have you dying on me.

72
00:19:24.774 --> 00:19:27.011
All right, enough
of this. Come on.


73
00:19:27.044 --> 00:19:28.512
Let's go.

74
00:19:28.546 --> 00:19:30.181
You can wear that back to camp.

75
00:19:31.148 --> 00:19:33.750
And then I expect it
back. You understand me?


76
00:19:38.222 --> 00:19:39.056
Let's go.

77
00:20:02.346 --> 00:20:03.347
So, here's the deal.

78
00:20:04.848 --> 00:20:07.384
You can spend the night here
but first thing in the morning,


79
00:20:07.418 --> 00:20:09.619
you're gonna go back to
wherever it is you came from.


80
00:20:09.652 --> 00:20:10.720
You hear me?

81
00:20:11.654 --> 00:20:14.925
Thank you for the food.

82
00:20:17.094 --> 00:20:19.196
There's some
blankets over there.


83
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.299
That tent over there is
mine. Do not come in there.


84
00:20:26.337 --> 00:20:27.204
Goodnight.

85
00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:43.813
She needed you!

86
00:21:44.881 --> 00:21:49.286
She needed you and
you weren't there!


87
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.021
You were never there!

88
00:23:48.405 --> 00:23:49.273
Here.

89
00:23:50.774 --> 00:23:52.142
I'll take that back now.

90
00:23:59.616 --> 00:24:01.185
Let's go. We got work to do.

91
00:24:31.515 --> 00:24:32.882
Why would you do that?

92
00:24:32.916 --> 00:24:35.052
You were going to kill it!

93
00:24:35.085 --> 00:24:37.488
Yeah, I was gonna kill
it. That was our dinner.


94
00:24:39.256 --> 00:24:40.424
I'm sorry.

95
00:24:40.457 --> 00:24:40.924
You're sorry?

96
00:24:42.025 --> 00:24:45.963
Yeah, well, we'll both be
sorry with empty stomachs.


97
00:24:45.996 --> 00:24:47.897
Don't ever touch my gun again.

98
00:25:14.158 --> 00:25:15.626
She's beautiful, isn't she?

99
00:25:20.264 --> 00:25:21.098
Yeah.

100
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.968
You should see
her in the winter.


101
00:25:26.203 --> 00:25:27.504
When she freezes over.

102
00:25:28.572 --> 00:25:31.842
And that ice, it's as
thick as your head.


103
00:25:31.875 --> 00:25:33.210
Even thicker.

104
00:25:38.081 --> 00:25:39.316
Good fishin', too.

105
00:26:01.338 --> 00:26:02.206
You like that?

106
00:26:04.141 --> 00:26:05.609
Yeah, why don't you try?

107
00:26:08.412 --> 00:26:09.279
Here.

108
00:26:16.587 --> 00:26:19.056
Okay. We'll figure this out.

109
00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:21.692
Here, another cool one.

110
00:26:24.261 --> 00:26:27.598
And what you wanna do,
you wanna lean way over,


111
00:26:27.631 --> 00:26:29.032
almost like you're fallin' over.

112
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.769
And then you gotta, you
gotta, snap, snap your wrist.


113
00:26:37.875 --> 00:26:39.142
Yeah.

114
00:26:40.878 --> 00:26:41.745
Yeah.

115
00:26:49.786 --> 00:26:50.654
Aria.

116
00:26:54.993 --> 00:26:56.493
You know what that is?

117
00:27:01.832 --> 00:27:03.534
It's a song that stands alone.

118
00:27:07.738 --> 00:27:08.772
But it holds its own.

119
00:27:12.209 --> 00:27:13.477
It's untouchable.

120
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:21.752
You remind me of an Aria.

121
00:27:24.755 --> 00:27:26.256
Do you mind if I call you that?

122
00:27:28.158 --> 00:27:29.893
I mean, I've gotta
call you somethin'.


123
00:27:29.928 --> 00:27:32.496
It's beautiful.

124
00:27:33.932 --> 00:27:35.766
It suits you.

125
00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:42.372
Wait.

126
00:27:42.406 --> 00:27:43.340
Aria, wait!

127
00:27:49.146 --> 00:27:51.983
You can't run from me, maggot!

128
00:27:52.016 --> 00:27:54.018
I'll find you!

129
00:27:57.187 --> 00:27:59.356
I gave you both everything.

130
00:27:59.389 --> 00:28:01.425
I even bought the
little maggot braces


131
00:28:01.458 --> 00:28:03.327
to fix her disgusting teeth.

132
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.628
Do you know how
much that cost me?


133
00:28:04.661 --> 00:28:07.065
Do you have any idea
how much that cost me?


134
00:28:07.097 --> 00:28:08.298
I don't understand.

135
00:28:08.332 --> 00:28:11.835
Oh, stop your deaf
wavin'. Get out of my way.


136
00:28:11.868 --> 00:28:15.572
I'm gonna teach you what
it's like to disrespect me.


137
00:28:21.045 --> 00:28:23.547
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

138
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:26.416
It's me.

139
00:28:27.117 --> 00:28:28.185
Jack.

140
00:28:34.424 --> 00:28:35.292
It's okay.

141
00:28:36.259 --> 00:28:37.929
It's okay.

142
00:28:37.962 --> 00:28:39.496
It was just a tree.

143
00:28:40.564 --> 00:28:42.466
What did you think
it was anyway?


144
00:28:44.701 --> 00:28:46.236
He's coming.

145
00:28:46.269 --> 00:28:47.437
Who's coming?

146
00:28:47.471 --> 00:28:49.941
Big Al.

147
00:28:49.974 --> 00:28:50.874
Who's Big Al?

148
00:29:23.007 --> 00:29:25.842
You really are a vindictive
bastard, you know that?


149
00:29:29.479 --> 00:29:30.714
Yeah.

150
00:29:30.747 --> 00:29:31.615
You.

151
00:29:33.084 --> 00:29:33.951
Wherever you are.

152
00:29:38.355 --> 00:29:40.290
This doesn't change anything.

153
00:29:42.359 --> 00:29:43.627
I hope you know that.

154
00:29:59.342 --> 00:30:01.545
Why do I even waste
my time with you?


155
00:30:07.784 --> 00:30:08.785
You're a joke.

156
00:30:27.738 --> 00:30:28.605
Hey.

157
00:30:29.806 --> 00:30:32.275
Come on.

158
00:30:38.049 --> 00:30:38.916
It's okay.

159
00:30:47.925 --> 00:30:48.759
In there.

160
00:30:50.427 --> 00:30:51.862
Get some sleep.

161
00:31:15.052 --> 00:31:15.920
Hm.

162
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:07.404
You were shaking like a leaf.

163
00:32:08.905 --> 00:32:10.074
Don't get used to it.

164
00:32:11.741 --> 00:32:13.343
Fish?

165
00:32:14.045 --> 00:32:14.578
Yeah.

166
00:32:15.579 --> 00:32:19.083
I couldn't sleep, so I
went and caught these.


167
00:32:19.116 --> 00:32:20.117
Hope you like fish.

168
00:32:21.919 --> 00:32:25.323
Mama and I used to fish.

169
00:32:27.024 --> 00:32:27.891
Yeah.

170
00:32:32.362 --> 00:32:34.131
I bet she misses
you so much, huh?


171
00:32:36.666 --> 00:32:38.069
Mama...

172
00:32:38.102 --> 00:32:40.071
she died.

173
00:32:44.008 --> 00:32:45.375
I'm sorry.

174
00:32:45.408 --> 00:32:48.212
I miss her.

175
00:32:48.246 --> 00:32:49.113
Yeah.

176
00:32:52.984 --> 00:32:54.252
What about your daddy?

177
00:32:54.285 --> 00:32:55.752
I bet he can't wait
to see you. He's...


178
00:32:55.785 --> 00:32:57.922
He killed her!

179
00:32:57.955 --> 00:32:59.823
He killed Mama!

180
00:33:14.437 --> 00:33:15.505
Aria?

181
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:21.245
Is your daddy looking for you?

182
00:33:21.279 --> 00:33:22.646
Is that why you're up here?

183
00:33:24.781 --> 00:33:25.649
What happened?

184
00:33:27.084 --> 00:33:29.419
You don't have to tell
me if you don't wanna.


185
00:33:31.122 --> 00:33:34.557
I had to save Mama.

186
00:33:37.962 --> 00:33:40.497
You are both gonna
learn to respect me!


187
00:33:44.268 --> 00:33:45.568
Are you listening?

188
00:33:45.602 --> 00:33:47.604
Oh, that's right. You can't.

189
00:33:47.637 --> 00:33:51.775
Because you're a stupid,
deaf waste of space.


190
00:33:51.808 --> 00:33:53.476
Stay quiet.

191
00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:54.744
What're you telling her?

192
00:33:54.778 --> 00:33:57.214
Hey, what're you telling her?

193
00:33:57.248 --> 00:33:58.581
What're you telling her?

194
00:33:58.615 --> 00:33:59.616
What are you telling her?

195
00:34:07.158 --> 00:34:08.292
I'm gonna kill you.

196
00:34:39.689 --> 00:34:42.126
You need to run!

197
00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:44.195
Never stop! Never come back!

198
00:34:44.228 --> 00:34:45.262
Never.

199
00:34:47.897 --> 00:34:49.799
Come with me.

200
00:34:51.068 --> 00:34:53.137
He'll catch us both.

201
00:34:57.441 --> 00:34:58.875
I love you.

202
00:34:58.908 --> 00:35:00.277
I love you too.

203
00:35:11.922 --> 00:35:13.723
I should've done
that years ago.


204
00:35:18.396 --> 00:35:21.198
You can't run from me, maggot!

205
00:35:21.232 --> 00:35:22.532
I'll find you!

206
00:35:35.046 --> 00:35:35.913
Shh.

207
00:35:38.049 --> 00:35:39.816
You're safe now.

208
00:35:39.849 --> 00:35:40.717
Okay?

209
00:35:41.584 --> 00:35:43.254
I'm scared!

210
00:35:43.287 --> 00:35:44.888
I know. It's okay.

211
00:35:46.323 --> 00:35:48.125
You can stay with me.

212
00:35:48.825 --> 00:35:50.894
I won't send you away.

213
00:35:51.561 --> 00:35:53.863
Okay?

214
00:35:53.897 --> 00:35:56.233
I won't send you anywhere.

215
00:36:12.816 --> 00:36:15.152
She's been out
there about a week.


216
00:36:15.186 --> 00:36:16.921
Think if we go back
where I killed her mama,


217
00:36:16.954 --> 00:36:18.923
we'll pick up a
trail from there.


218
00:36:19.756 --> 00:36:21.425
She's probably
dead, all right?


219
00:36:21.459 --> 00:36:22.625
And you don't look
like you're in


220
00:36:22.659 --> 00:36:24.528
the best shape of your
life right now, either.


221
00:36:24.562 --> 00:36:25.795
Are you questioning
me, baby brother?


222
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:27.431
- You wanna run things now?
- No, Al.


223
00:36:27.465 --> 00:36:29.066
Roy, she saw what I did,

224
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.135
and that could come
back on all of us.


225
00:36:31.168 --> 00:36:32.836
She can't even speak.

226
00:36:32.869 --> 00:36:35.339
You know, you are an
idiot, Roy. You know that?


227
00:36:35.372 --> 00:36:36.639
She can talk, believe me.

228
00:36:36.673 --> 00:36:38.109
Oh, really? You
ever heard her?


229
00:36:38.142 --> 00:36:39.676
No, but I know she can.

230
00:36:40.844 --> 00:36:42.846
Stop your crying and gear up.

231
00:36:42.879 --> 00:36:46.050
She's out there by
herself. We'll find her.


232
00:36:46.083 --> 00:36:49.752
It's gonna take more than a
little maggot to kill Big Al.


233
00:36:49.786 --> 00:36:51.322
- Go!
- All right.


234
00:36:51.355 --> 00:36:52.189
- Go!
- All right!


235
00:36:52.223 --> 00:36:54.191
You two, get in the back!

236
00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:56.927
Come on!

237
00:37:28.926 --> 00:37:31.095
Yeah! That was
an awesome cast.


238
00:37:31.128 --> 00:37:33.330
Okay, now what you wanna do
is you wanna let that worm


239
00:37:33.364 --> 00:37:35.032
sink all the way to the bottom,

240
00:37:35.065 --> 00:37:36.467
'cause that's
where the fish are,


241
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.570
and that's what we wanna
catch, 'cause we're hungry.


242
00:37:39.603 --> 00:37:42.573
So once the line stops moving,
that means it's on the bottom


243
00:37:42.606 --> 00:37:43.840
and at that point,

244
00:37:43.873 --> 00:37:46.876
that's when you wanna
start to slowly reel it in.


245
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:47.710
Not yet.

246
00:37:48.512 --> 00:37:50.481
So after you start
reeling it in,


247
00:37:50.514 --> 00:37:54.817
you're gonna wait for a
tug, 'cause that's the fish,


248
00:37:54.851 --> 00:37:58.556
and then you wanna yank it
back and catch the fish!


249
00:37:58.589 --> 00:38:00.491
And I want you to reel
that fish in, okay?


250
00:38:00.524 --> 00:38:01.926
Yeah!

251
00:38:01.959 --> 00:38:04.694
So go ahead and start to reel
it and when you feel that tug,


252
00:38:04.727 --> 00:38:07.131
that's the fish and...

253
00:38:19.243 --> 00:38:20.110
It's okay.

254
00:38:21.645 --> 00:38:22.980
There's a learning curve.

255
00:38:23.746 --> 00:38:24.814
All right?

256
00:38:31.088 --> 00:38:32.323
What?

257
00:38:32.356 --> 00:38:33.224
I...

258
00:38:34.891 --> 00:38:36.227
Why are you splashing yourself?

259
00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.963
What're you doing? No, you're
gonna scare the fish away!


260
00:38:38.996 --> 00:38:40.231
Look, you scared the fish away!

261
00:38:40.264 --> 00:38:42.333
That, that's on you.

262
00:38:42.366 --> 00:38:43.000
No!

263
00:38:43.033 --> 00:38:44.834
No, look. Here, hold this.

264
00:38:44.867 --> 00:38:46.103
I'm gonna get a fish.

265
00:38:48.205 --> 00:38:50.507
You're so silly!

266
00:38:51.642 --> 00:38:53.944
Why did you fall for
that? You're out.


267
00:38:53.978 --> 00:38:57.047
Oh, my god.

268
00:39:05.755 --> 00:39:07.824
Tonight, we feast.

269
00:39:09.293 --> 00:39:11.428
I want the fat one.

270
00:39:12.363 --> 00:39:13.230
As you should.

271
00:39:14.064 --> 00:39:17.334
For he who geets it, eats it.

272
00:39:19.203 --> 00:39:20.404
Hm.

273
00:39:20.437 --> 00:39:21.605
Okay.

274
00:39:21.639 --> 00:39:23.107
You did not like that one.

275
00:39:24.774 --> 00:39:25.808
Okay.

276
00:39:25.842 --> 00:39:27.111
No dad jokes.

277
00:40:03.213 --> 00:40:04.081
It's for you.

278
00:40:04.948 --> 00:40:06.050
It's a little big.

279
00:40:07.084 --> 00:40:09.219
You know, but I think
you'll grow into it.


280
00:40:11.355 --> 00:40:12.423
I mean, you can't stay

281
00:40:12.456 --> 00:40:14.158
in those dirty things
forever, you know?


282
00:40:17.795 --> 00:40:18.861
Besides...

283
00:40:20.564 --> 00:40:23.334
You smell really bad.

284
00:40:24.134 --> 00:40:27.137
Thank you, it's beautiful.

285
00:40:31.908 --> 00:40:35.312
I don't know about
all that, but, uh...


286
00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.615
Here you go. Try it on.

287
00:40:46.323 --> 00:40:47.191
Go ahead.

288
00:41:39.877 --> 00:41:40.477
Wow.

289
00:41:41.845 --> 00:41:45.416
How did I miss a little princess
dance right into my camp?


290
00:41:47.584 --> 00:41:48.452
Do you like it?

291
00:41:51.789 --> 00:41:52.623
Good. I'm glad.

292
00:42:09.039 --> 00:42:12.543
What's that?

293
00:42:12.576 --> 00:42:15.479
Oh, it's nothin', it's just...

294
00:42:15.512 --> 00:42:17.481
It's just something
I wear, that's all.


295
00:42:18.782 --> 00:42:20.617
Did someone give it to you?

296
00:42:20.651 --> 00:42:22.886
I don't really wanna
talk about it, all right?


297
00:42:22.921 --> 00:42:24.555
Can I try it on?

298
00:42:24.588 --> 00:42:25.456
No!

299
00:42:38.769 --> 00:42:40.237
Aria, I'm sorry.

300
00:42:41.338 --> 00:42:43.607
I shouldn't yell
at you, I just...


301
00:42:44.708 --> 00:42:47.177
It's just not something
I talk about, all right?


302
00:42:50.314 --> 00:42:53.617
Did it belong to
someone special?


303
00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:54.518
Yeah.

304
00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.287
Very special.

305
00:43:01.525 --> 00:43:05.762
Too special for the likes
of me. That's for sure.


306
00:43:12.937 --> 00:43:15.572
But enough about
this old grump, huh?


307
00:43:18.141 --> 00:43:19.676
Let's grill some fish, yeah?

308
00:44:01.852 --> 00:44:03.153
Al, Al, Al, Al!

309
00:44:03.186 --> 00:44:04.888
Al, Al, stop!

310
00:44:04.923 --> 00:44:06.056
I see it.

311
00:44:15.065 --> 00:44:17.100
- Is it hers?
- Yeah, it is.


312
00:44:17.134 --> 00:44:18.368
Give me that.

313
00:44:20.571 --> 00:44:23.240
Looks like she went
up the mountain.


314
00:44:23.273 --> 00:44:27.477
So, we're gonna have to
hoof it from here. Let's go.


315
00:45:27.738 --> 00:45:29.040
Dad.

316
00:45:29.073 --> 00:45:32.142
I'm sorry, honey.
I didn't mean to spy.


317
00:45:35.479 --> 00:45:37.214
Sorry I took your notebook.

318
00:45:38.348 --> 00:45:40.150
I was going to put it back.

319
00:45:43.553 --> 00:45:46.924
You know, some of my
best work is in that book.


320
00:45:46.958 --> 00:45:49.893
I would appreciate it if you
asked me next time, okay?


321
00:45:52.796 --> 00:45:53.664
Well...

322
00:45:55.133 --> 00:45:57.101
What did you think?

323
00:45:57.135 --> 00:46:01.772
I think that with some more
practice, you can do better.


324
00:46:29.067 --> 00:46:31.802
Sorry, I woke you.

325
00:46:35.305 --> 00:46:36.473
It's okay.

326
00:46:38.142 --> 00:46:39.743
I was just having a bad dream.

327
00:46:47.584 --> 00:46:50.520
What do you say we go on
a little adventure today?


328
00:46:50.554 --> 00:46:51.421
Yeah?

329
00:46:54.458 --> 00:46:55.325
Yeah.

330
00:47:34.232 --> 00:47:35.298
Hey.

331
00:47:36.399 --> 00:47:38.002
You ever fly in a plane before?

332
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:41.571
Would you like to?

333
00:47:43.607 --> 00:47:44.474
Yeah?

334
00:47:45.809 --> 00:47:46.743
Hold that thought.

335
00:47:56.887 --> 00:47:59.589
Well, I don't exactly
have a plane, but uh,


336
00:48:00.891 --> 00:48:01.892
we could still fly.

337
00:48:12.869 --> 00:48:14.238
'Ay.

338
00:48:14.272 --> 00:48:15.505
No peakin'.

339
00:48:47.437 --> 00:48:50.007
Captain, prepare for takeoff.

340
00:48:52.977 --> 00:48:57.982
Oh!

341
00:49:00.051 --> 00:49:01.885
What're you laughing at?

342
00:49:01.919 --> 00:49:04.222
Can I try

343
00:49:04.255 --> 00:49:05.589
You wanna try?

344
00:49:10.794 --> 00:49:11.862
Absolutely. Here.

345
00:49:45.428 --> 00:49:46.964
A lot further than mine did.

346
00:49:59.409 --> 00:50:00.543
Wanna do some more?

347
00:50:01.312 --> 00:50:02.746
Yeah.

348
00:50:02.779 --> 00:50:03.647
Me too.

349
00:52:00.464 --> 00:52:04.502
Thank you for
teaching me how to fly.


350
00:52:08.005 --> 00:52:09.206
You're welcome.

351
00:52:28.625 --> 00:52:30.127
It belonged to my daughter.

352
00:52:33.297 --> 00:52:34.764
The necklace.

353
00:52:44.674 --> 00:52:46.876
It's the only thing
I have left of hers.


354
00:52:58.522 --> 00:53:00.224
I wasn't there for her.

355
00:53:07.331 --> 00:53:08.299
In the end...

356
00:53:11.168 --> 00:53:12.236
I let her die...

357
00:53:15.106 --> 00:53:16.006
All alone.

358
00:53:18.675 --> 00:53:19.843
I wasn't there.

359
00:53:23.047 --> 00:53:26.450
My little
girl died alone.


360
00:53:29.253 --> 00:53:32.755
Without her daddy.

361
00:53:48.239 --> 00:53:49.240
Let's finish strong.

362
00:54:00.417 --> 00:54:02.086
Hey, Dad.

363
00:54:02.119 --> 00:54:02.987
I'm still here.

364
00:54:03.686 --> 00:54:05.389
Where are you?

365
00:54:05.422 --> 00:54:06.689
Call me back.

366
00:54:17.968 --> 00:54:19.802
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi.


367
00:54:19.836 --> 00:54:21.005
Is he coming?

368
00:54:21.038 --> 00:54:22.606
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

369
00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:23.706
Okay.

370
00:54:24.608 --> 00:54:27.378
Okay.

371
00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.588
Hey, Mom.

372
00:55:10.621 --> 00:55:14.225
I can't get through to Dad
and you're not picking up.


373
00:55:14.258 --> 00:55:17.461
I'm walking home.
I'll see you soon.


374
00:55:30.174 --> 00:55:31.041
Hey, Mom.

375
00:55:35.212 --> 00:55:38.848
Yeah, surprise-surprise. His
dress rehearsal went late.


376
00:55:40.484 --> 00:55:41.751
I don't know.

377
00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.989
I'm almost home.

378
00:57:22.852 --> 00:57:23.987
Jack.

379
00:57:24.021 --> 00:57:26.223
Well done. I am very pleased.

380
00:57:26.256 --> 00:57:28.692
Congratulations. It's
gonna be a huge success.


381
00:57:28.726 --> 00:57:31.595
Looking forward to it.

382
00:57:31.628 --> 00:57:32.996
Hi, baby. I'm on my way.

383
00:57:34.598 --> 00:57:35.566
Hello, who is this?

384
00:57:37.368 --> 00:57:38.202
Yeah?

385
00:57:41.305 --> 00:57:42.172
What?

386
00:58:19.977 --> 00:58:22.546
It was my fault Mama died.

387
00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:26.483
Don't say that. That's
not what happened.


388
00:58:26.517 --> 00:58:28.886
Mama tried to save me.

389
00:58:28.919 --> 00:58:30.654
I was too heavy.

390
00:58:30.687 --> 00:58:31.822
She had to set me down.

391
00:58:31.855 --> 00:58:33.924
That's not what happened.

392
00:58:35.659 --> 00:58:38.328
Bad things happen
to good people.


393
00:58:43.167 --> 00:58:46.036
That doesn't mean
that it's their fault.


394
00:58:50.941 --> 00:58:52.009
Okay?

395
00:58:53.610 --> 00:58:54.645
It wasn't your fault.

396
00:58:56.280 --> 00:59:00.217
What was your daughter's name?

397
00:59:04.855 --> 00:59:06.190
Melody.

398
00:59:13.697 --> 00:59:15.032
Her name was Melody.

399
00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:24.608
That is a beautiful name.

400
00:59:32.917 --> 00:59:34.585
That's a beautiful
thing to say.


401
01:00:08.785 --> 01:00:09.653
Look out.

402
01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:11.889
No!

403
01:00:11.923 --> 01:00:13.290
You wanna let her
know we're comin'?


404
01:00:13.323 --> 01:00:14.558
I thought I saw something!

405
01:00:14.591 --> 01:00:17.528
Listen to me. Let
me do the thinking.


406
01:00:17.561 --> 01:00:19.029
You do somethin'
stupid like that again,


407
01:00:19.062 --> 01:00:21.398
I'm gonna put a
bullet in your head.


408
01:00:21.431 --> 01:00:23.734
Al, knock it off, all right?
He was just trying to help.


409
01:00:23.767 --> 01:00:25.769
Shut up, Roy. I don't
care if you're my brother.


410
01:00:25.802 --> 01:00:28.472
Let me get somethin' straight
here with all you. Look at me.


411
01:00:28.505 --> 01:00:30.942
I got enough bullets for
each and every one of you.


412
01:00:30.975 --> 01:00:32.609
Let's go!

413
01:00:32.643 --> 01:00:34.578
Go. Don't give me that look.

414
01:00:34.611 --> 01:00:37.681
- I saw somethin'!
- Put the gun down and go!


415
01:00:37.714 --> 01:00:38.582
Gun down!

416
01:00:57.134 --> 01:00:59.102
What was that?

417
01:00:59.136 --> 01:01:00.939
It's probably nothin'.

418
01:01:05.043 --> 01:01:07.844
That storm's gonna
be on us soon.


419
01:01:07.878 --> 01:01:09.346
We better pick up the pace.

420
01:01:10.814 --> 01:01:11.682
Come on.

421
01:01:25.562 --> 01:01:26.797
Oh!

422
01:01:28.131 --> 01:01:30.200
We were almost stuck
in that one, huh?


423
01:01:32.336 --> 01:01:33.203
Ah!

424
01:01:34.204 --> 01:01:35.672
It's really coming down.

425
01:01:37.641 --> 01:01:38.977
Wow.

426
01:01:44.147 --> 01:01:47.384
Are you scared of
a little rainstorm?


427
01:01:49.853 --> 01:01:50.454
It's okay.

428
01:01:51.588 --> 01:01:56.226
It's not that bad, 'cause
it's still quite a ways off.


429
01:01:59.063 --> 01:02:00.764
Wanna know how I know that?

430
01:02:03.101 --> 01:02:06.104
You see, it's in the time
between the lightning


431
01:02:06.136 --> 01:02:07.337
and the thunder.

432
01:02:08.372 --> 01:02:10.273
I'll show you, okay?

433
01:02:17.681 --> 01:02:19.616
It's three kilometers.

434
01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:20.918
It's pretty far.

435
01:02:22.619 --> 01:02:23.487
You try.

436
01:02:32.195 --> 01:02:35.198
Three kilometers.

437
01:02:35.232 --> 01:02:36.800
Three kilometers.

438
01:02:36.833 --> 01:02:38.702
That's like two miles.

439
01:02:38.735 --> 01:02:39.836
That's far, right?

440
01:02:43.074 --> 01:02:46.443
It's not so scary when you
look at it that way, you know?


441
01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:04.728
Aria?

442
01:03:05.997 --> 01:03:07.698
Can I ask you a question?

443
01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:10.634
It's about Big Al.

444
01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:16.773
Do you think that he has
any big scary friends


445
01:03:16.807 --> 01:03:20.844
that would help him if he
asked them if he needed them?


446
01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.616
My uncle, Roy.

447
01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:29.252
He never hurt us,

448
01:03:29.286 --> 01:03:32.823
but he never stopped Big Al.

449
01:03:32.856 --> 01:03:33.724
Uh-huh?

450
01:03:34.558 --> 01:03:36.393
Is there anybody
else, you think?


451
01:03:37.128 --> 01:03:39.130
There are two.

452
01:03:39.163 --> 01:03:40.131
Two of 'em.

453
01:03:40.164 --> 01:03:42.733
The first one is really tall.

454
01:03:42.766 --> 01:03:45.302
His name is Bo.

455
01:03:46.137 --> 01:03:49.639
The second one is shorter.

456
01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:52.809
I don't remember his name.

457
01:03:52.843 --> 01:03:56.313
But he has black hair.

458
01:03:58.448 --> 01:04:03.221
Mama called them the silent two.

459
01:04:03.253 --> 01:04:05.957
They don't say much,

460
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:08.325
but if people don't pay,

461
01:04:08.358 --> 01:04:10.794
they hurt them.

462
01:04:12.796 --> 01:04:17.201
Do you think they
are coming to get me?


463
01:04:17.235 --> 01:04:18.502
Yeah.

464
01:04:18.535 --> 01:04:21.838
Well, I'm a big believer
in looking at things


465
01:04:21.872 --> 01:04:25.909
the way that they really are
and I'm not gonna lie to you.


466
01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.815
I think they're coming.

467
01:04:32.883 --> 01:04:36.820
But if they are, they
haven't found us yet.


468
01:04:36.853 --> 01:04:39.289
And they're probably
real far away still.


469
01:04:41.458 --> 01:04:44.962
But if they do find us,
and they may never find us,


470
01:04:44.996 --> 01:04:48.266
but if they do, I need
to be ready, you know?


471
01:04:48.298 --> 01:04:50.767
What do you mean, ready?

472
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:55.505
I will never
let them take you.


473
01:04:56.473 --> 01:04:59.876
But they have guns.

474
01:05:01.112 --> 01:05:02.379
You're probably right.

475
01:05:03.713 --> 01:05:06.716
But I have something
that they don't have.


476
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:08.418
What?

477
01:05:09.954 --> 01:05:10.787
You.

478
01:05:13.090 --> 01:05:14.658
And you're worth fighting for.

479
01:05:17.028 --> 01:05:18.562
I'm scared.

480
01:05:18.595 --> 01:05:20.697
I know. I know you're scared.

481
01:05:23.466 --> 01:05:25.937
But courage isn't
about not being afraid.


482
01:05:27.404 --> 01:05:30.507
It's about being afraid and
still doing something about it.


483
01:05:33.945 --> 01:05:36.646
I don't feel brave.

484
01:05:38.615 --> 01:05:41.418
That's the funny
thing about bravery.


485
01:05:41.451 --> 01:05:45.822
Oftentimes, the brave ones
don't know that they are,


486
01:05:45.856 --> 01:05:47.390
until they have to be.

487
01:05:48.391 --> 01:05:50.094
But just know this.

488
01:05:51.095 --> 01:05:52.729
If they're looking for us,

489
01:05:52.762 --> 01:05:55.498
and they find us and
they try and take you,


490
01:05:57.201 --> 01:05:58.936
I will kill them all.

491
01:06:00.871 --> 01:06:02.672
You promise?

492
01:06:04.741 --> 01:06:05.609
I promise.

493
01:06:12.449 --> 01:06:13.951
I mean it with all my heart.

494
01:06:21.225 --> 01:06:23.060
Yeah. Brave.

495
01:06:23.094 --> 01:06:24.694
Brave.

496
01:06:34.105 --> 01:06:35.339
Hm.

497
01:06:50.453 --> 01:06:51.521
Hey, you.

498
01:06:55.026 --> 01:06:56.160
It's me again.

499
01:06:59.829 --> 01:07:02.432
Sorry about calling you
a vindictive bastard.


500
01:07:05.269 --> 01:07:06.436
But I need a favor.

501
01:07:11.441 --> 01:07:12.944
I know I don't deserve one.

502
01:07:16.347 --> 01:07:18.082
But I'm
gonna ask anyway.


503
01:07:31.095 --> 01:07:32.196
I'll wait to use this,

504
01:07:36.466 --> 01:07:38.568
if you help me keep her safe.

505
01:07:51.881 --> 01:07:54.718
But if anything happens to her,

506
01:07:54.751 --> 01:07:57.821
if she dies, I swear...

507
01:07:59.589 --> 01:08:00.790
I swear I'll use it.

508
01:08:02.159 --> 01:08:03.094
You understand me?

509
01:08:08.765 --> 01:08:10.034
I may already be dead,

510
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:17.074
but if I'm not, no
more hesitation.


511
01:08:19.377 --> 01:08:20.810
This little game is over.

512
01:08:31.721 --> 01:08:33.590
I know you don't care about me,

513
01:08:36.027 --> 01:08:37.128
or what happens to me.

514
01:08:39.763 --> 01:08:41.265
Maybe you're not even there.

515
01:08:46.137 --> 01:08:47.871
But if you're there, God,

516
01:08:50.441 --> 01:08:52.076
show me what to do.

517
01:08:55.912 --> 01:08:57.248
Show me, please.

518
01:09:24.975 --> 01:09:26.343
There I go again.

519
01:09:27.811 --> 01:09:28.979
Talking to the sky.

520
01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:36.253
You'd think I'd have learned
my lesson by now, right?


521
01:11:29.133 --> 01:11:31.035
Al, I found her trail!

522
01:11:37.408 --> 01:11:38.808
What's wrong?

523
01:12:01.898 --> 01:12:03.833
Over here! I found her!

524
01:12:03.866 --> 01:12:05.536
Where?

525
01:12:05.569 --> 01:12:07.304
Over here!

526
01:12:09.839 --> 01:12:11.942
Step where I step, okay?

527
01:12:11.976 --> 01:12:14.712
Over here, over here!

528
01:12:14.744 --> 01:12:16.779
You find a friend, maggot?

529
01:12:16.813 --> 01:12:18.082
He's not gonna save you.

530
01:12:18.115 --> 01:12:19.583
Go get her.

531
01:12:19.617 --> 01:12:21.118
Come on.

532
01:12:47.444 --> 01:12:48.679
No, no!

533
01:12:48.712 --> 01:12:49.779
No!

534
01:12:58.255 --> 01:13:01.358
Well, she went and
found herself a protector.


535
01:13:01.392 --> 01:13:04.695
I don't know, Al.
This is dangerous.


536
01:13:04.728 --> 01:13:06.664
This guy knows this
place better than we do,


537
01:13:06.697 --> 01:13:08.365
and he's expecting us.

538
01:13:08.399 --> 01:13:11.868
Four of us, one of
him. Do the math, Roy.


539
01:13:12.902 --> 01:13:14.305
You, get up.

540
01:13:15.639 --> 01:13:17.474
It went
through my leg, Al!


541
01:13:17.508 --> 01:13:20.044
I need to get to a hospital!

542
01:13:20.077 --> 01:13:23.447
Hey, the only way we're
leaving this mountain


543
01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:24.581
is with the maggot.

544
01:13:26.483 --> 01:13:27.484
She's mine.

545
01:13:36.427 --> 01:13:37.860
Come here, come here.

546
01:13:37.894 --> 01:13:41.031
Hurry up there.
Go, go, go, go, go.


547
01:13:45.536 --> 01:13:46.403
Let's go.

548
01:14:09.026 --> 01:14:11.095
It's all clear.

549
01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:31.415
Al. Listen, I'm telling you.

550
01:14:31.448 --> 01:14:35.252
We need to go back, man. This
guy's prepared for this, okay?


551
01:14:35.285 --> 01:14:36.153
No!

552
01:14:37.654 --> 01:14:40.023
He dies tonight.

553
01:14:40.057 --> 01:14:42.693
You're speaking
my language now.


554
01:14:42.726 --> 01:14:44.294
We better get off this trail.

555
01:14:52.069 --> 01:14:53.937
Come here, baby. Come here.

556
01:14:55.406 --> 01:14:58.308
Get down, get down. I need
you to stay here, okay?


557
01:14:58.342 --> 01:15:01.211
If we're gonna stand a chance,
I'm gonna need to use this,


558
01:15:01.245 --> 01:15:04.114
and I cannot risk hitting
you in the crossfire, okay?


559
01:15:04.148 --> 01:15:06.817
I don't want you to die!

560
01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:07.651
I know you're scared,

561
01:15:08.919 --> 01:15:11.388
but I made a promise that
I intend to keep, okay?


562
01:15:13.323 --> 01:15:14.191
Remember.

563
01:15:16.326 --> 01:15:17.194
We are brave.

564
01:15:18.495 --> 01:15:19.363
Brave.

565
01:15:20.264 --> 01:15:21.131
Yeah.

566
01:15:42.553 --> 01:15:43.420
Please.

567
01:15:44.321 --> 01:15:45.189
Let me save her.

568
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:47.257
Please.

569
01:16:06.443 --> 01:16:07.311
Aria!

570
01:16:18.856 --> 01:16:20.090
Come on out!

571
01:16:22.059 --> 01:16:24.461
Come on out and
put the rifle down!


572
01:16:26.263 --> 01:16:28.165
I know you're out there, mister!

573
01:16:28.999 --> 01:16:30.067
Just put it down!

574
01:16:32.603 --> 01:16:35.272
You better stop playing
with me, mister!


575
01:16:36.907 --> 01:16:37.608
I'll kill her!

576
01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:41.044
Put down your
weapons and walk away!


577
01:16:42.246 --> 01:16:43.647
Why would we do that?

578
01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:46.783
'Cause if you don't, I'll
kill every single one of you!


579
01:16:46.817 --> 01:16:48.886
Don't move! Don't move!

580
01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:49.921
Go. Go ahead!

581
01:16:49.954 --> 01:16:51.788
I'll put you down
for good this time.


582
01:16:54.791 --> 01:16:57.761
Don't play with me, mister.
You shoot me, she falls.


583
01:16:59.663 --> 01:17:01.398
Is that what you want?

584
01:17:01.431 --> 01:17:03.433
Is that what you
want? You want this?


585
01:17:03.467 --> 01:17:04.735
No, no!

586
01:17:04.768 --> 01:17:06.570
Okay, okay, okay!

587
01:17:06.603 --> 01:17:08.105
- Now.
- Okay.


588
01:17:08.138 --> 01:17:09.740
Don't hurt her.

589
01:17:09.773 --> 01:17:10.641
Please.

590
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:13.744
Please.

591
01:17:13.777 --> 01:17:15.178
I'm putting the gun down.

592
01:17:16.446 --> 01:17:17.581
It's okay.

593
01:17:17.614 --> 01:17:18.782
I'm putting the gun down.

594
01:17:20.684 --> 01:17:21.552
Okay.

595
01:17:23.887 --> 01:17:26.290
Boy, that was
stupid. Take her, Roy.


596
01:17:31.128 --> 01:17:32.396
Get her, get her.

597
01:17:33.330 --> 01:17:34.197
Aria.

598
01:17:34.865 --> 01:17:36.366
Why?

599
01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.868
All this?

600
01:17:37.901 --> 01:17:40.170
She's less than nothing.

601
01:17:40.203 --> 01:17:42.306
Why would you choose
death for her?


602
01:17:44.908 --> 01:17:46.143
What've you got here?

603
01:17:46.176 --> 01:17:48.211
Oh. Well...

604
01:17:49.112 --> 01:17:50.747
Oh! I like this.

605
01:17:51.848 --> 01:17:53.817
You know, I always
wanted one of these.


606
01:17:54.986 --> 01:17:55.786
You know she stabbed me?

607
01:17:57.254 --> 01:18:00.824
I didn't think she had it in
her but that maggot stabbed me.


608
01:18:00.857 --> 01:18:03.260
She stabbed me right about...

609
01:18:03.293 --> 01:18:05.796
Here!

610
01:18:10.834 --> 01:18:11.602
Now you're gonna know

611
01:18:12.836 --> 01:18:16.873
that maggot will only
bring you pain and death.


612
01:18:16.907 --> 01:18:17.774
Look at me!

613
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:20.277
You're gonna die.

614
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:22.846
You're gonna die knowing
it was all for nothing.


615
01:18:24.281 --> 01:18:26.183
Her name is Aria.

616
01:18:26.216 --> 01:18:28.352
What did you say to me?

617
01:18:31.321 --> 01:18:33.223
Her name is Aria.

618
01:18:35.325 --> 01:18:38.161
Kill him!

619
01:18:43.467 --> 01:18:44.501
That's it.

620
01:18:44.534 --> 01:18:45.402
Jack!

621
01:18:47.571 --> 01:18:48.705
Don't hurt him!

622
01:18:49.806 --> 01:18:51.842
Surprise-surprise.

623
01:18:51.875 --> 01:18:53.543
It finally speaks.

624
01:18:55.046 --> 01:18:55.912
Get her.

625
01:18:57.314 --> 01:18:58.582
Come here, come here.

626
01:18:58.615 --> 01:18:59.616
No!

627
01:19:01.685 --> 01:19:03.420
You stay right there.

628
01:19:03.453 --> 01:19:06.356
They say when you're
on your way out,


629
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:08.692
you go into a big
tunnel of light.


630
01:19:08.725 --> 01:19:11.161
I always wanted to
know if that's true.


631
01:19:11.194 --> 01:19:13.330
So, do me a favor
and tell me. Yeah?


632
01:19:14.865 --> 01:19:16.433
Nice necklace.

633
01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:24.075
That's it.

634
01:19:24.108 --> 01:19:25.308
There ya go.

635
01:19:26.843 --> 01:19:28.578
I got you. I got you.

636
01:19:30.114 --> 01:19:32.683
There you go. There you go.

637
01:19:40.058 --> 01:19:42.325
Jack!

638
01:19:42.359 --> 01:19:45.796
Look at him! You're
the one that did this.


639
01:19:45.829 --> 01:19:48.365
You're the one that did this!

640
01:19:49.133 --> 01:19:50.434
Let's go. Come on.

641
01:19:52.769 --> 01:19:53.637
Go.

642
01:19:57.774 --> 01:19:58.709
Cut it out.

643
01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:44.774
Who are you?

644
01:22:45.909 --> 01:22:46.944
Drop the rifle!

645
01:22:47.844 --> 01:22:49.213
Do it!

646
01:22:49.247 --> 01:22:50.380
I'll kill her!

647
01:22:51.581 --> 01:22:53.783
Do what I tell ya, mister!

648
01:22:53.817 --> 01:22:54.684
Do it!

649
01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:57.587
Come on!

650
01:23:05.528 --> 01:23:07.131
You kill my men, huh?

651
01:23:07.164 --> 01:23:08.832
You kill my brother?

652
01:23:08.865 --> 01:23:10.268
For what? This?

653
01:23:10.301 --> 01:23:11.936
This little maggot?

654
01:23:11.969 --> 01:23:13.371
Why?

655
01:23:13.403 --> 01:23:15.973
She doesn't even have a name!

656
01:23:17.707 --> 01:23:18.608
You

657
01:23:18.642 --> 01:23:19.743
What're you telling her?

658
01:23:19.776 --> 01:23:22.313
are brave.

659
01:24:01.484 --> 01:24:03.321
This isn't over.

660
01:24:03.354 --> 01:24:05.789
She doesn't get to walk away!

661
01:24:07.457 --> 01:24:08.558
What're you doing?

662
01:24:08.591 --> 01:24:10.227
No, no! Wait, wait!

663
01:24:11.561 --> 01:24:14.966
I've got money. 
I'll let her go!

664
01:24:14.999 --> 01:24:16.133
No, wait, wait, wait!

665
01:26:08.312 --> 01:26:10.713
It's beautiful, isn't it?

666
01:26:11.982 --> 01:26:13.984
The view?

667
01:26:16.487 --> 01:26:17.321
No.

668
01:26:17.354 --> 01:26:18.222
Life.

669
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:22.193
I'd almost forgotten.

670
01:26:26.497 --> 01:26:28.099
Me too.

671
01:26:33.337 --> 01:26:35.539
I'll go start packing up camp.

672
01:26:35.573 --> 01:26:36.773
Okay.

673
01:27:09.206 --> 01:27:10.207
Thank you.
