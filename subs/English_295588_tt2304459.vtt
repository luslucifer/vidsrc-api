1
00:00:36.784 --> 00:00:39.651
Black, 22.

2
00:00:41.622 --> 00:00:43.555
Black, 22!

3
00:00:45.392 --> 00:00:47.626
Set!

4
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:09.314
You there.

5
00:01:09.316 --> 00:01:11.183
What's your name?

6
00:01:12.952 --> 00:01:14.920
You Freddie?

7
00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:17.923
Freddie, I'm guessing you
never played football.


8
00:01:21.662 --> 00:01:25.330
I want you to take a look at
your buddies down the bench.


9
00:01:25.332 --> 00:01:29.001
Go on. Now do you see any
difference between you and them?


10
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:39.111
Nothing? Not a thing?

11
00:01:40.613 --> 00:01:43.015
- What's your name, son?
- Ashley.


12
00:01:43.017 --> 00:01:44.349
Ashley?

13
00:01:48.222 --> 00:01:49.788
Ashley.

14
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.659
Ashley, can you tell
Freddie what's wrong?


15
00:01:53.661 --> 00:01:58.197
Your shoulder pads.
They go under your shirt.


16
00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:02.668
It's going
to be a long season.


17
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.036
I loved that

18
00:02:04.038 --> 00:02:06.138
Championship game
was incredible.


19
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.706
I was on the sidelines.

20
00:02:07.708 --> 00:02:09.875
And why can't
we do that again?


21
00:02:09.877 --> 00:02:13.345
- Do what?
- Win a championship.


22
00:02:13.347 --> 00:02:15.914
You've won one,
why not two?


23
00:02:15.916 --> 00:02:17.683
I've won two,
but who's counting...


24
00:02:17.685 --> 00:02:19.885
Coach just take over
for a minute right?


25
00:02:19.887 --> 00:02:21.720
All right,
you heard the coach.


26
00:02:21.722 --> 00:02:23.222
Form two,
two lines over there.


27
00:02:23.224 --> 00:02:27.025
Mr. Marshall agrees,
together, we can do it.


28
00:02:27.027 --> 00:02:29.228
Weren't you going
to get me a beverage
or something?


29
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.431
Oh, yeah,
I'll get your soda.
Did you say diet?


30
00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:37.603
- No.
- No, of course not.
Stupid of me. Diet. Stupid.


31
00:02:37.605 --> 00:02:40.105
I'll be right back!

32
00:02:42.075 --> 00:02:43.342
What was that?

33
00:02:43.344 --> 00:02:46.545
A pain in my neck, mainly.

34
00:02:46.547 --> 00:02:48.914
He teaches math over
at the middle school.


35
00:02:48.916 --> 00:02:52.284
Yeah, well, he's
the new Athletic Director now.


36
00:02:52.286 --> 00:02:55.087
- You kidding?
- I wish I was.


37
00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:57.122
Well, how in heck
did that happen?


38
00:02:57.124 --> 00:02:59.858
Well, some bull about
the board wanting


39
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.794
a football program
succession plan.


40
00:03:02.796 --> 00:03:04.229
Huh.

41
00:03:04.231 --> 00:03:07.232
It doesn't hurt
that his uncle's on the board.


42
00:03:07.234 --> 00:03:08.533
Oh.

43
00:03:08.535 --> 00:03:10.068
Quarterbacks,
I don't need you to fire it.


44
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.438
Freddie, let's
fix those pads.


45
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.774
Hi, I'm Travis.

46
00:03:15.776 --> 00:03:17.476
- I'm Jerry.
- Can you throw?


47
00:03:17.478 --> 00:03:18.810
Can you catch?

48
00:03:18.812 --> 00:03:20.912
They aim
to replace me.


49
00:03:20.914 --> 00:03:23.649
What? Are they firing you?

50
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:25.150
No, Willard, I'm retiring.

51
00:03:25.152 --> 00:03:29.821
They just want to
name my successor.


52
00:03:29.823 --> 00:03:32.391
What they don't realize is,
I already know who


53
00:03:32.393 --> 00:03:35.894
the next football coach
at Corbin is going to be.


54
00:03:35.896 --> 00:03:37.629
- And I'm looking at him.
- Me?


55
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:41.466
Willard, do you want
to coach Pee Wee league
the rest of your life?


56
00:03:41.468 --> 00:03:46.438
I want you to
go at about fifty percent,
just a little jog, okay.


57
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.906
Hut.

58
00:03:47.908 --> 00:03:49.908
Travis, that's too fast.

59
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.745
- Whoa!
- Ooh!


60
00:03:53.747 --> 00:03:55.480
Wow!
- That'll do.


61
00:03:55.482 --> 00:04:00.485
- Who're those boys?
- That's boy's name
is Travis Freeman.


62
00:04:00.487 --> 00:04:05.157
- He's, um, Jerry Baker.
- Here, Coach.


63
00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.328
Now those two boys
were born to play football.


64
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.331
Running backs
and straight ahead, you can run
a straight line can't you?


65
00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:14.966
Yes, sir!
- What's this play called?


66
00:04:14.968 --> 00:04:17.669
23 Blast!
- Why do we call it that?


67
00:04:17.671 --> 00:04:20.639
The 2 back runs
through the 3 hole!


68
00:04:20.641 --> 00:04:23.709
All right, bring it in.

69
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:25.477
One, two, three...

70
00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.946
Red Hounds!
All right,
let's go.


71
00:04:27.948 --> 00:04:31.516
- Travis.
- Yes, coach.


72
00:04:31.518 --> 00:04:35.554
- Does Jerry know the plays?
- Uhh, yeah, pretty much.


73
00:04:35.556 --> 00:04:39.524
Well, you know 'em real good.
So you'll help him out, right?


74
00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:45.297
23 Blast! 23 Blast!

75
00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:46.531
And 23 Blast!

76
00:04:46.533 --> 00:04:48.100
Ready! Break!

77
00:04:51.204 --> 00:04:53.572
Fingertips!

78
00:04:53.574 --> 00:04:55.006
Down!

79
00:04:55.008 --> 00:04:56.708
Cameron, get your butt down!

80
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.811
Set! Hut!

81
00:05:05.586 --> 00:05:08.520
- Whoo!
Travis,
meet at the top.


82
00:05:14.395 --> 00:05:17.996
I don't know why Coach Farris
puts up with you,
but I will not.


83
00:05:17.998 --> 00:05:20.399
I don't want to
lose this, Mr. Duncan.
You know what this is?


84
00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:23.268
If I find contraband, Mr. Baker,
I will have you expelled.


85
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.404
No, sir, this is an article
about my friend, here.


86
00:05:25.406 --> 00:05:28.607
"Travis Freeman,
the Redhound star
everything man,


87
00:05:28.609 --> 00:05:30.509
has his team on the
fast track to the..."


88
00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:34.179
- Empty your pockets.
- "He catches touchdowns,
he runs for touchdowns,


89
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:36.381
he's the heart
and soul of the team.
Blah blah, blah."


90
00:05:36.383 --> 00:05:40.218
Nothing about the handsome
quarterback, Jerry Baker.
Why is that, Mr. Duncan?


91
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.555
Because you're
not worth writing about.


92
00:05:43.557 --> 00:05:45.757
- Mr. Freeman.
- Yes sir?


93
00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:50.996
I suggest you find new friends,
you don't want to end up
in prison.


94
00:05:54.033 --> 00:05:56.768
One day you're
going to go too far!


95
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.637
He's been after
me since 5th grade.


96
00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.105
He used to say I was
cheating in Math.


97
00:06:00.107 --> 00:06:01.873
- You were cheating in Math.
- I didn't cheat!


98
00:06:01.875 --> 00:06:04.476
- You copied off my paper.
- Yeah. Off of you.


99
00:06:04.478 --> 00:06:05.911
That's friends.
Don't count.


100
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.795
- Guess who!
- Hi, Molly.


101
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.235
- Oh, man!
- Aw, you're going
to make me late!


102
00:06:30.237 --> 00:06:32.304
Make sure you score
a touchdown for me now.


103
00:06:32.306 --> 00:06:36.208
- Okay, I'll try.

104
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:48.620
Hey, I don't think your music
is supposed to arrive
before your car.


105
00:06:48.622 --> 00:06:51.122
You know, it gets me
all pumped up for the game.


106
00:06:51.124 --> 00:06:56.495
You know what,
I forgot to ask,
how'd that Math exam go?


107
00:06:56.497 --> 00:06:57.662
Aced it.

108
00:06:57.664 --> 00:07:00.532
Ooh, you're my favorite son.

109
00:07:00.534 --> 00:07:02.033
Mom, I'm your only son.

110
00:07:02.035 --> 00:07:05.003
That must be why
you're my favorite.


111
00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:06.471
- Get out of here.
- Oh!


112
00:07:06.473 --> 00:07:07.806
You gotta be quicker
if you want one of those.


113
00:07:07.808 --> 00:07:08.874
I'm going to
get in your sleep.


114
00:07:08.876 --> 00:07:10.842
Yeah, right.

115
00:07:10.844 --> 00:07:13.178
- Kick butt, Trav!
- Thanks, Ashley.


116
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.846
Hey, don't forget
my touchdown!


117
00:07:14.848 --> 00:07:17.349
Don't forget my touchdown!

118
00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:20.185
Oh, hey, Ashley.
Good, Karen, you're here.


119
00:07:20.187 --> 00:07:23.488
Can you take a look at that?
Something's wrong with that pen,
it keeps falling off my sweater.


120
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.157
- You want to get started
on the chili for me?
You got it.


121
00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:27.792
Thank you, dear.

122
00:07:27.794 --> 00:07:31.196
- Hey, Mr. Freeman.
- Ashley.
You got my camera, missus?


123
00:07:31.198 --> 00:07:36.535
Got it all charged up.
Don't forget to press record.


124
00:07:53.921 --> 00:07:57.322
Hey. Hey, Burley,
you listen to me,


125
00:07:57.324 --> 00:07:59.190
he hasn't missed
a single game,


126
00:07:59.192 --> 00:08:02.027
and he's not going
to miss one now because
he's got a runny nose.


127
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:04.596
If his fever's gone,
he can play.


128
00:08:06.032 --> 00:08:09.501
Feel him.
Go on, feel him.


129
00:08:09.503 --> 00:08:13.438
- Huh? Cool as a cucumber.
- You feeling all right,
Cameron?


130
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.176
He has got to play.
My boy has got to play.


131
00:08:18.178 --> 00:08:23.281
I'm ready, coach,
I'm ready to play.


132
00:08:23.283 --> 00:08:25.016
- Are we ready?
- Ready.


133
00:08:25.018 --> 00:08:26.251
- Are we ready?
- Ready!


134
00:08:26.253 --> 00:08:27.285
- Are we ready?
- Ready!


135
00:08:27.287 --> 00:08:28.687
- Are we ready?
- Ready!


136
00:08:28.689 --> 00:08:30.722
- Redhound! Redhound!
- Pride! Pride!


137
00:08:30.724 --> 00:08:31.856
- Redhound!
- Pride!


138
00:08:31.858 --> 00:08:32.891
- Redhound!
- Pride!


139
00:08:32.893 --> 00:08:34.593
- Redhound!
- Pride!


140
00:08:34.595 --> 00:08:37.462
- Ah!

141
00:08:43.236 --> 00:08:45.136
<i>Tonight it's</i>
<i>the Corbin Redhounds</i>


142
00:08:45.138 --> 00:08:47.572
<i>hosting the Lynn Camp Wildcats.</i>

143
00:08:47.574 --> 00:08:50.241
<i>The Redhound defense doesn't</i>
<i>give up many big plays</i>


144
00:08:50.243 --> 00:08:53.445
<i>and that's the way head coach</i>
<i>Willard Farris likes it.</i>


145
00:08:53.447 --> 00:08:56.548
<i>The Wildcats will have to</i>
<i>pick their spots tonight.</i>


146
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.752
<i>The 4 & 1 Redhounds boast</i>
<i>a high powered offense</i>


147
00:09:00.754 --> 00:09:02.954
<i>led by Junior Travis Freeman.</i>

148
00:09:17.103 --> 00:09:20.972
Corbin Redhounds!

149
00:09:20.974 --> 00:09:24.109
Corbin Redhounds! Let's go!

150
00:09:24.111 --> 00:09:26.945
Lee rip zip, 34 power,
strong wing left. Go on.


151
00:09:28.815 --> 00:09:29.981
- I'm gonna get closer.
- Okay.


152
00:09:29.983 --> 00:09:31.316
I'll be over there
in a second.


153
00:09:31.318 --> 00:09:33.351
Get in there, son!
Come on, Cam!


154
00:09:33.353 --> 00:09:36.421
Hey, Marshal.
How's little Cam feeling?


155
00:09:36.423 --> 00:09:38.990
Back to normal, eating me
out of house and home.


156
00:09:38.992 --> 00:09:44.496
Yeah. Well, you know,
they're growing boys.
How you all feeling tonight?


157
00:09:47.868 --> 00:09:50.001
I want my touchdown!

158
00:09:52.939 --> 00:09:56.441
<i>Touchdown,</i>
<i>Redhounds!</i>


159
00:09:56.443 --> 00:09:59.044
- What happened, who scored?
- Travis!


160
00:09:59.046 --> 00:10:01.179
Travis,
I missed his touchdown?


161
00:10:01.181 --> 00:10:05.483
<i>Touchdown Redhounds!</i>

162
00:10:05.485 --> 00:10:07.385
<i>Travis Freeman.</i>

163
00:10:09.623 --> 00:10:11.456
- How did he score?
- He ran it in.


164
00:10:11.458 --> 00:10:15.694
- Nah, I think it was a pass.
- 23 Blast!


165
00:10:15.696 --> 00:10:17.028
23 what?

166
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.197
Okay, I test
Fred on all the plays,


167
00:10:19.199 --> 00:10:21.366
so that when they put
him in he's ready.


168
00:10:21.368 --> 00:10:24.002
Whatever it was,
Larry's got it on tape.


169
00:10:24.004 --> 00:10:27.105
I'm not so sure he does.

170
00:10:32.212 --> 00:10:36.481
Panther right,

171
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.054
How much time we got?

172
00:10:43.056 --> 00:10:45.390
Uh, we're fine.
Where's the party tonight?


173
00:10:45.392 --> 00:10:49.394
- Quit messing around,
call the play.
- No fun.


174
00:10:49.396 --> 00:10:52.063
Okay.

175
00:10:52.065 --> 00:10:55.200
Dang, I can't remember...

176
00:10:55.202 --> 00:10:57.502
Oh, well.
Trav, go deep.


177
00:10:57.504 --> 00:10:59.671
- Come on Jerry.
- What's the play!?


178
00:10:59.673 --> 00:11:02.574
Hey! You guys want
to win this game or not?!


179
00:11:02.576 --> 00:11:05.777
Let's do combo right.
Z left. You guys do whatever.


180
00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:09.547
You get in the end zone.
And you, give me some time.


181
00:11:09.549 --> 00:11:11.683
- On one. Ready?
- Break!


182
00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:18.289
That's not the play
you called, Willard.


183
00:11:18.291 --> 00:11:21.092
Black 22, black 22.

184
00:11:21.094 --> 00:11:23.328
Set. Hut.

185
00:11:25.431 --> 00:11:26.731
- He's open. He's open.
- Okay.


186
00:11:29.136 --> 00:11:31.936
Pull, pull!

187
00:11:40.713 --> 00:11:43.214
<i>That's</i>
<i>Travis Freeman once again</i>


188
00:11:43.216 --> 00:11:45.750
<i>on a pretty pass from</i>
<i>quarterback Jerry Baker.</i>


189
00:11:45.752 --> 00:11:51.823
<i>Bold call from Coach Willard</i>
<i>Farris, but it worked.</i>


190
00:11:51.825 --> 00:11:57.061
Davey Crockett,
you ever change my plays again,
I will bench you fast.


191
00:11:57.063 --> 00:12:02.167
<i>He's got the</i>
<i>Redhounds and his workhorse</i>
<i>firing on all cylinders.</i>


192
00:12:02.169 --> 00:12:03.635
Good job, man.

193
00:12:03.637 --> 00:12:05.770
- He call you
Davey Crockett again?
- Yeah.


194
00:12:05.772 --> 00:12:08.306
You think I should
tell him it's not my name?


195
00:12:08.308 --> 00:12:10.942
- It's a good name.
- Hey, hey Marlow.


196
00:12:10.944 --> 00:12:14.345
This game's not over.
Now, get your head in the
game, there's another half.


197
00:12:14.347 --> 00:12:16.581
Come on! Come on! Come on!

198
00:12:16.583 --> 00:12:19.884
- That was a heck of a throw.
- Yes, sir.


199
00:12:21.487 --> 00:12:25.857
- Did he forget the play?
- Yes, sir.


200
00:12:29.763 --> 00:12:34.165
- You all right?
- Yes. This headache
is just getting worse!


201
00:12:34.167 --> 00:12:38.937
- Do you want to leave?
- No, no, I'll be fine,
it's just, uh...


202
00:12:38.939 --> 00:12:42.674
Ew! Get off me.

203
00:12:42.676 --> 00:12:46.177
- Loser.
- Do all the
cheerleaders love me,


204
00:12:46.179 --> 00:12:48.746
or is it just Molly?

205
00:12:52.117 --> 00:12:56.621
- Your dad know you're here?
- You kidding?
I'm studying with you!


206
00:12:56.623 --> 00:13:01.025
You can't hang with me.
I'll beat you at keg stand too.


207
00:13:01.027 --> 00:13:04.462
- He better not
mess up this year.
- He'll be fine.


208
00:13:04.464 --> 00:13:06.564
He still doesn't
even know the plays!


209
00:13:06.566 --> 00:13:08.800
- Look, he gets mixed up
once in a while...
- I mean it.


210
00:13:08.802 --> 00:13:11.469
He can't be screwing up
my scholarship.


211
00:13:11.471 --> 00:13:14.339
You're always covering
for him.


212
00:13:14.341 --> 00:13:16.708
I got one shot, one.

213
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.210
And he's ain't going
to mess that up.


214
00:13:19.212 --> 00:13:23.581
Seven, eight, nine, ten!

215
00:13:26.753 --> 00:13:29.888
You better control
your boy or I will.


216
00:13:36.362 --> 00:13:39.530
- Redhounds, baby!
- Hey, Jerry, come on.


217
00:13:39.532 --> 00:13:41.599
You and me man,
Redhounds.
- Hey.


218
00:13:41.601 --> 00:13:46.070
Me and you,
we're going to state. Hey!


219
00:13:46.072 --> 00:13:49.440
Okay, that's
your friend Jerry.


220
00:13:53.612 --> 00:13:55.780
Whoa!

221
00:13:57.082 --> 00:13:58.716
Dad!

222
00:13:58.718 --> 00:14:02.487
Let's see
what's going on here.


223
00:14:05.424 --> 00:14:07.692
When did you notice
the swelling?


224
00:14:07.694 --> 00:14:09.127
This morning.

225
00:14:09.129 --> 00:14:11.963
Close your eyes for me.

226
00:14:11.965 --> 00:14:14.032
Now open.

227
00:14:16.468 --> 00:14:18.269
Is this
from football?


228
00:14:18.271 --> 00:14:22.473
No, Travis has a
great deal of infection
visible in the sinus area.


229
00:14:22.475 --> 00:14:26.277
Infection, where
did that come from?


230
00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:27.745
It's hard to tell.

231
00:14:27.747 --> 00:14:31.382
I want to get Travis started
on medication right away.


232
00:14:33.385 --> 00:14:35.987
Dr. Connelly wants me
to prep a surgical room.


233
00:14:35.989 --> 00:14:40.224
- What's happening?
- Travis's infection
is not responding to medication.


234
00:14:40.226 --> 00:14:43.761
His face is swelling
and his temperature
has risen to 106.


235
00:14:43.763 --> 00:14:46.965
- Oh, dear Lord!
- We need to get him
into surgery quickly.


236
00:14:46.967 --> 00:14:49.567
I'll have more answers
when I get in there
and see what we're up against.


237
00:14:49.569 --> 00:14:52.937
- Here he is. Here he is.
- Oh, Travis! Hi, baby!


238
00:14:52.939 --> 00:14:56.274
You're gonna have
to take that cross off.
Yes, ma'am.


239
00:14:56.276 --> 00:14:58.409
Okay, I got it. I got it.
Hi, honey.


240
00:14:58.411 --> 00:15:02.981
Mama's right here. Okay?

241
00:15:02.983 --> 00:15:04.983
- Hey.
- Hmm.


242
00:15:04.985 --> 00:15:07.518
I'll see you soon.

243
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.654
- I'm going to be fine, Mom.
- Now!


244
00:15:09.656 --> 00:15:12.857
- Okay.
- I'll be fine.


245
00:15:17.162 --> 00:15:20.898
All right,
he'll be fine.


246
00:15:32.344 --> 00:15:37.081
Travis,
I need you to count
backwards for me from 100.


247
00:15:40.185 --> 00:15:45.990
100, 99,

248
00:15:45.992 --> 00:15:52.063
98, 97...

249
00:16:22.861 --> 00:16:24.929
Go deep!

250
00:16:28.834 --> 00:16:30.968
Go deeper!

251
00:16:33.205 --> 00:16:34.806
Deeper!

252
00:17:52.985 --> 00:17:56.854
Hello! Hello!

253
00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.824
- Oh, Travis.
- Mom?


254
00:17:59.826 --> 00:18:02.760
Travis. We're right here.

255
00:18:02.762 --> 00:18:04.962
Mom, no, I can't see.
What...


256
00:18:04.964 --> 00:18:08.766
Honey, listen, the
doctor explained to us


257
00:18:08.768 --> 00:18:11.335
- that you...
- Dad!


258
00:18:11.337 --> 00:18:14.138
- I'm here.
- Why can't I see?


259
00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:17.074
Travis.

260
00:18:22.447 --> 00:18:25.283
Explain what, Dad?

261
00:18:25.285 --> 00:18:28.085
You're blind, son.

262
00:18:30.389 --> 00:18:32.723
What do you
mean I'm blind?


263
00:18:32.725 --> 00:18:35.059
You lost your eyesight.

264
00:18:35.061 --> 00:18:37.128
Okay.

265
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.097
Okay, for how long?

266
00:18:41.633 --> 00:18:43.935
I don't understand.

267
00:18:44.803 --> 00:18:48.873
There was
too much infection.


268
00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.151
I can't be blind!

269
00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.853
No, Mom.

270
00:19:02.855 --> 00:19:05.056
It's okay, baby.
It's gonna be okay.


271
00:19:05.058 --> 00:19:07.124
Dad.

272
00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.238
We'll get through this.

273
00:19:44.529 --> 00:19:47.098
You see that?

274
00:20:10.989 --> 00:20:13.057
You heard?

275
00:20:17.562 --> 00:20:19.497
I'm gonna need you
to stay focused.


276
00:20:19.499 --> 00:20:21.699
I'm focused.

277
00:20:22.668 --> 00:20:26.604
Okay, you're focused.

278
00:20:26.606 --> 00:20:30.207
I'm going to need
to step up.


279
00:20:33.312 --> 00:20:35.479
Team needs a leader.

280
00:20:36.748 --> 00:20:38.983
Are you that guy?

281
00:20:42.521 --> 00:20:45.323
Thank you for coming, really.

282
00:20:45.325 --> 00:20:49.660
I'll make sure Travis knows
that each of every one
of you were here.


283
00:20:49.662 --> 00:20:52.396
Take care, okay?

284
00:20:56.268 --> 00:20:58.803
He's getting better.

285
00:20:58.805 --> 00:21:01.806
He's just not up
for visitors yet.


286
00:21:01.808 --> 00:21:04.442
I'm sorry.

287
00:21:17.956 --> 00:21:19.990
- Sorry.
- Come here.


288
00:21:19.992 --> 00:21:24.862
<i>I know the last</i>
<i>thing you want to do right now</i>
<i>is play football.</i>


289
00:21:26.832 --> 00:21:31.202
Like it or not, we got a game.

290
00:21:31.204 --> 00:21:37.375
I don't know why things like
this happen to good people.


291
00:21:37.377 --> 00:21:39.744
I don't know.

292
00:21:39.746 --> 00:21:45.082
I do know, Travis would
not want any of you


293
00:21:45.084 --> 00:21:48.052
to use his misfortune
as an excuse


294
00:21:48.054 --> 00:21:49.887
for not playing your best,

295
00:21:49.889 --> 00:21:52.890
for not playing just
the way you would,


296
00:21:52.892 --> 00:21:56.727
if he was out there with us.

297
00:21:56.729 --> 00:22:00.264
That's what he
expects from us


298
00:22:00.266 --> 00:22:03.033
and that's all we
can do for him.


299
00:22:03.035 --> 00:22:07.838
So we're going to dedicate
this game to Travis.


300
00:22:09.174 --> 00:22:10.941
Bring it in.

301
00:22:14.913 --> 00:22:17.281
- Travis on three.
- One, two, three.


302
00:22:17.283 --> 00:22:19.250
Travis!

303
00:22:19.252 --> 00:22:22.086
<i>Baker is trying</i>
<i>to signal his receiver,</i>


304
00:22:22.088 --> 00:22:25.623
<i>there is some confusion on the</i>
<i>line with another delay...</i>


305
00:22:25.625 --> 00:22:28.859
- Come on, man!

306
00:22:30.395 --> 00:22:34.331
<i>He bumped</i>
<i>into the guard.</i>


307
00:22:39.439 --> 00:22:41.071
Throw it away!

308
00:22:41.073 --> 00:22:44.208
Hello?

309
00:22:46.446 --> 00:22:50.514
- Bingo!

310
00:22:58.291 --> 00:22:59.957
Ah!

311
00:22:59.959 --> 00:23:01.459
- What are you doing?
- What're you doing, man?


312
00:23:01.461 --> 00:23:03.828
- It's an inside curl.
- He's supposed to cut out.


313
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:07.298
- Shut your mouth.
- It's inside.


314
00:24:53.905 --> 00:24:55.606
<i>I love them</i>
<i>Redhounds.</i>


315
00:24:55.608 --> 00:24:59.109
<i>Love 'em but, boy, my heart</i>
<i>can't take another season</i>


316
00:24:59.111 --> 00:25:02.046
<i>like last one.</i>
<i>Disappointment.</i>


317
00:25:02.048 --> 00:25:05.215
<i>Redhounds are</i>
<i>a big disappointment.</i>


318
00:25:05.217 --> 00:25:07.751
<i>They let us down again.</i>

319
00:25:07.753 --> 00:25:10.254
Open, right there. Oh!

320
00:25:10.256 --> 00:25:13.123
I'm sorry, sweetie,
that bite was too big.


321
00:25:13.125 --> 00:25:15.793
- That's all right.
- Okay, here we go.


322
00:25:15.795 --> 00:25:19.430
- No...
- Oh! Travis!


323
00:25:19.432 --> 00:25:21.732
No, it's disgusting,
those are not eggs.


324
00:25:21.734 --> 00:25:22.800
- Oh, honey!
- Orange juice.


325
00:25:22.802 --> 00:25:24.602
Right here.

326
00:25:24.604 --> 00:25:26.470
- Oh, the straw is right here.
- Mom, I got it.


327
00:25:26.472 --> 00:25:28.606
Mom, I know where
the straw is, thank you.


328
00:25:28.608 --> 00:25:30.341
Okay.

329
00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:33.310
Jerry!

330
00:25:33.312 --> 00:25:35.379
How did you get
past the nurse?


331
00:25:35.381 --> 00:25:39.450
Oh, I can be
sneaky sometimes.


332
00:25:39.452 --> 00:25:42.252
Hey, Trav.

333
00:25:42.254 --> 00:25:45.589
Yeah, I know, I know you
don't want any visitors.


334
00:25:45.591 --> 00:25:50.294
I don't blame you.
Some of them people
are like sandpaper.


335
00:25:51.997 --> 00:25:53.998
Some of them people
are real snoozers.


336
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.266
And what makes you
think you ain't one of them?


337
00:25:56.268 --> 00:25:57.935
Oh!

338
00:25:57.937 --> 00:26:00.371
Good, I thought you
might have been deaf, too!


339
00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.907
It's okay, Mom.
Jerry can stay.


340
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:05.509
Oh, what, like he's
going to kick me out?


341
00:26:05.511 --> 00:26:06.610
I was thinking about it.

342
00:26:06.612 --> 00:26:08.412
Jerry, do you think maybe
you could stay


343
00:26:08.414 --> 00:26:10.681
with Travis for a little while?
I have an errand to run.


344
00:26:10.683 --> 00:26:12.716
Sure.

345
00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.688
I won't be long.

346
00:26:30.669 --> 00:26:33.070
- Ha ha ha...
- Really?


347
00:26:34.506 --> 00:26:40.511
- Just checking.
- Well, how'd you do?


348
00:26:40.513 --> 00:26:43.814
Ah, we did all right.
We didn't make playoffs.


349
00:26:43.816 --> 00:26:45.849
I know all that,
how did you do?


350
00:26:45.851 --> 00:26:49.119
Oh, you know me,
I'm did good.


351
00:26:49.121 --> 00:26:51.522
Well, they moved me
to second string, but...


352
00:26:51.524 --> 00:26:56.126
What? They put Freddie
in over you! How'd that happen?


353
00:26:56.128 --> 00:26:57.995
I don't know.
Farris never liked me.


354
00:26:57.997 --> 00:26:59.363
Farris loves you.

355
00:26:59.365 --> 00:27:01.665
Come on,
let's get out of here.


356
00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:13.444
Oh, hey,
check out the nurses.


357
00:27:14.212 --> 00:27:16.513
Whoa, babe on the left.

358
00:27:16.515 --> 00:27:19.216
- Blonde, brunette?
- Nope, redhead.


359
00:27:19.218 --> 00:27:21.418
She's a cutie too.

360
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.487
Look left and smile sexy.

361
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:32.830
I still got it.

362
00:27:33.898 --> 00:27:35.566
Oh, sweet shades.

363
00:27:35.568 --> 00:27:37.534
- Here, put these on.
- What?


364
00:27:37.536 --> 00:27:38.202
- Here.
- Ow!


365
00:28:28.487 --> 00:28:30.621
- When I say jump, jump.
- Wait, what?


366
00:28:30.623 --> 00:28:31.955
Jump!

367
00:28:45.436 --> 00:28:46.670
Let me ask you something.

368
00:28:46.672 --> 00:28:48.472
Did we just make fools
of ourselves?


369
00:28:48.474 --> 00:28:50.274
- Yes, pretty much.
- Yes!


370
00:28:50.276 --> 00:28:53.577
Hey, meet me at the top.

371
00:28:55.146 --> 00:28:59.383
- What's blind like?
- It is weird.


372
00:29:03.988 --> 00:29:06.723
It's pretty scary, man.

373
00:29:08.359 --> 00:29:10.494
It's like having
your eyes closed


374
00:29:10.496 --> 00:29:13.730
and you can never
open them.


375
00:29:15.767 --> 00:29:17.868
I'm sorry, man.

376
00:29:24.342 --> 00:29:27.177
You're going be fine,
man, all right?


377
00:29:27.179 --> 00:29:29.179
You're Travis Freeman.

378
00:29:43.728 --> 00:29:48.065
<i>Dr. Sanders</i>
<i>report to ICU.</i>


379
00:29:48.067 --> 00:29:51.702
<i>Dr. Sanders report to ICU.</i>

380
00:30:03.548 --> 00:30:06.149
You need to fill
out these forms.


381
00:30:06.151 --> 00:30:08.552
We'll set up
a referral meeting,


382
00:30:08.554 --> 00:30:12.055
and come up with an
intervention plan
for your son.


383
00:30:12.057 --> 00:30:14.691
An intervention plan?

384
00:30:14.693 --> 00:30:18.228
The sooner we start the process,
the sooner we'll find
a place for Travis.


385
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:23.834
Travis has a place,
in our home.


386
00:30:25.737 --> 00:30:29.406
Mrs. Freeman,
you need to realize,


387
00:30:29.408 --> 00:30:33.277
you no longer
have a normal son.


388
00:30:41.085 --> 00:30:42.419
Let me help you.

389
00:30:42.421 --> 00:30:44.187
It's your first time home,
maybe you want to try


390
00:30:44.189 --> 00:30:45.923
using the cane.
It's right here, sweetheart.


391
00:30:45.925 --> 00:30:47.190
I don't want to use it.

392
00:31:09.113 --> 00:31:12.349
Come in.

393
00:31:13.785 --> 00:31:16.253
- Hey.
- Hey, coach, how are you?


394
00:31:16.255 --> 00:31:19.790
Come on in, please.
Close the door.


395
00:31:19.792 --> 00:31:21.725
Have a seat.

396
00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:27.664
Willard, I want you
to know you have my support.


397
00:31:27.666 --> 00:31:29.900
- Thank you, Jasper.
- Let me finish.


398
00:31:29.902 --> 00:31:33.570
You have my support,
if you want to drop
Baker from the team.


399
00:31:33.572 --> 00:31:37.240
Jerry? Drop him?
What gave you that idea?


400
00:31:37.242 --> 00:31:41.511
Baker is just the
worst kind of bad egg,


401
00:31:41.513 --> 00:31:44.147
always trying
to get away with something.


402
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:48.986
- He's trouble.
- Look, I will agree
with you,


403
00:31:48.988 --> 00:31:51.321
Jerry is a challenge,

404
00:31:51.323 --> 00:31:53.457
but football is the
only thing the boy has.


405
00:31:53.459 --> 00:31:56.259
- You benched him.
- Yeah, I know I did.


406
00:31:56.261 --> 00:31:59.129
He lost his way, but who
knows he won't figure it out.


407
00:31:59.131 --> 00:32:03.000
Willard, your contract
is up after next year,
isn't it?


408
00:32:03.002 --> 00:32:06.503
If Baker becomes a distraction,

409
00:32:06.505 --> 00:32:10.173
you have a remedy.
Don't you?


410
00:32:15.714 --> 00:32:18.515
Kentucky Mobility
Center, may I help you?


411
00:32:18.517 --> 00:32:20.350
Yes. One moment, please.

412
00:32:20.352 --> 00:32:22.886
Travis Freeman.

413
00:32:24.989 --> 00:32:27.858
Oh, good, you're back.
How did it go?


414
00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.028
Waste of time.

415
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.363
I'm not going back.

416
00:32:33.365 --> 00:32:36.233
Well, that's fine.

417
00:32:36.235 --> 00:32:38.802
An hour there
and an hour back,


418
00:32:38.804 --> 00:32:41.071
and he walks out on the
woman after 15 minutes.


419
00:32:41.073 --> 00:32:44.541
- And you say it's just fine.
- He didn't like her, Larry.


420
00:32:44.543 --> 00:32:47.911
15 minutes, and the women
is supposed to be


421
00:32:47.913 --> 00:32:51.882
his mobility coach,
assigned to him by the state!


422
00:32:51.884 --> 00:32:54.551
Who else is going to teach
him how to get along?


423
00:32:54.553 --> 00:32:57.554
- We'll figure it out.
- It's been almost three months


424
00:32:57.556 --> 00:32:59.790
and he's barely
left his room.


425
00:33:01.726 --> 00:33:06.563
Mary, we have to talk about
a special school for the boy.


426
00:33:08.366 --> 00:33:10.333
He's not ready for that.

427
00:33:10.335 --> 00:33:13.270
- I'll teach him myself.
- No, you can't.


428
00:33:13.272 --> 00:33:15.572
We have no experience
with this.


429
00:33:15.574 --> 00:33:17.007
No, and that's final.

430
00:33:17.009 --> 00:33:19.743
Just hear me
out for a second.


431
00:33:30.422 --> 00:33:31.688
Yes, can I help you?

432
00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:33.924
Mrs. Freeman,
I'm Patty Wheatley.


433
00:33:33.926 --> 00:33:38.095
- Sorry?
- Travis's mobility coach.


434
00:33:38.097 --> 00:33:42.265
Oh, I'm so sorry.
We just never expected
to see you here.


435
00:33:42.267 --> 00:33:45.535
Travis has
missed two appointments.


436
00:33:45.537 --> 00:33:47.437
Where is he?

437
00:33:47.439 --> 00:33:49.139
Well, he's in his bedroom,

438
00:33:49.141 --> 00:33:51.108
but I'm afraid you've come all
this way for nothing.


439
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:53.944
Where's his room?
Travis? Is it in this way?


440
00:33:53.946 --> 00:33:57.380
You know what? I'm
afraid I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.


441
00:33:57.382 --> 00:34:02.586
In accordance with the
Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act of 1990,


442
00:34:02.588 --> 00:34:07.757
the state Kentucky will allow
no disabled child to be deprived
of a free public education.


443
00:34:07.759 --> 00:34:10.494
I have not deprived
my son of anything.


444
00:34:10.496 --> 00:34:12.562
Mom.
- Travis, its okay.


445
00:34:12.564 --> 00:34:15.966
- Hey, Travis, remember me?
- Oh, not you again.


446
00:34:15.968 --> 00:34:18.502
- I'll be in my room.
- Well, we can start there.


447
00:34:18.504 --> 00:34:21.838
- Miss Wheatley, hey.
- Whoa!


448
00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:26.910
- His, uh, cane looks unused.
- Mom.


449
00:34:26.912 --> 00:34:29.479
Does your husband stack his
dirty dishes in the bedroom?


450
00:34:29.481 --> 00:34:32.082
- Well, of course not,
but Travis...
- Why should you allow your son


451
00:34:32.084 --> 00:34:36.019
- to treat your home
like a pig sty?
- Because... oh!


452
00:34:37.688 --> 00:34:39.456
Wow.

453
00:34:39.458 --> 00:34:41.491
Do you do your own cleaning?

454
00:34:41.493 --> 00:34:43.793
Because I don't really
care what it looks like.


455
00:34:43.795 --> 00:34:46.963
Well, let's open a window.

456
00:34:46.965 --> 00:34:48.665
Wow!

457
00:34:48.667 --> 00:34:51.234
Oh, that's better.

458
00:34:53.337 --> 00:34:55.839
Football player, huh?

459
00:34:55.841 --> 00:34:57.807
You figure that
out all by yourself?


460
00:34:57.809 --> 00:35:00.310
- What's that?
- Nothing.


461
00:35:00.312 --> 00:35:04.681
Yeah. Well, listen up, pal.
You got two options here:


462
00:35:04.683 --> 00:35:09.019
you can stay in your little,
safe, protected environment


463
00:35:09.021 --> 00:35:11.555
or you can get up off
your sorry, little can


464
00:35:11.557 --> 00:35:12.989
and figure out
how to whip this.


465
00:35:12.991 --> 00:35:15.358
It doesn't make any
difference to me.


466
00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.727
Just don't waste my time.

467
00:35:38.549 --> 00:35:40.617
Son of a...

468
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:50.927
<i>Hey, well,</i>
<i>you know what that means,</i>
<i>it's your Redhound report.</i>


469
00:35:50.929 --> 00:35:55.098
<i>Get your teeth off my legs.</i>

470
00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.435
<i>For the next 60 minutes,</i>
<i>I'll answer your calls</i>


471
00:35:58.437 --> 00:36:02.405
<i>and tell you with just</i>
<i>three months till kickoff</i>


472
00:36:02.407 --> 00:36:05.742
<i>whether this year's Redhound</i>
<i>Team has what it takes</i>


473
00:36:05.744 --> 00:36:07.944
<i>to make the playoffs.</i>

474
00:36:17.455 --> 00:36:22.692
- Here you are.
- Oh, Ashley, thank you so...
you are a life-saver.


475
00:36:22.694 --> 00:36:24.594
It's all right.
I also have your change.


476
00:36:24.596 --> 00:36:27.030
- Oh, thank you, sweetie.
- You're welcome.


477
00:36:27.032 --> 00:36:29.466
Oh, you need me to take
that sandwich into Travis?


478
00:36:29.468 --> 00:36:31.101
No, no, I can
take care of it.


479
00:36:31.103 --> 00:36:35.038
His dad is taking him to
Lexington in a little bit and...


480
00:36:36.407 --> 00:36:39.976
No, I would love for you
to take this into Travis.


481
00:36:39.978 --> 00:36:42.379
I bet he'd like
talking to you.


482
00:36:42.381 --> 00:36:45.181
All right.

483
00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:00.397
Travis?

484
00:37:04.568 --> 00:37:06.469
Trav?

485
00:37:14.178 --> 00:37:16.079
Trav.

486
00:37:23.621 --> 00:37:25.955
Trav.

487
00:37:25.957 --> 00:37:28.491
Hey, Trav! Oh, sorry.

488
00:37:28.493 --> 00:37:31.094
Ashley?

489
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:35.632
Hey.

490
00:37:35.634 --> 00:37:41.204
- Why are you here?
- No reason.


491
00:37:41.206 --> 00:37:43.173
Nice hat.

492
00:37:48.679 --> 00:37:52.916
- How are you doing?
- Just great.


493
00:37:54.218 --> 00:37:55.719
Brought you some lunch.

494
00:37:55.721 --> 00:37:59.122
I'm good, thank you.
I'm not hungry.


495
00:37:59.824 --> 00:38:02.058
All right, well...

496
00:38:03.394 --> 00:38:04.861
Thank you.

497
00:38:04.863 --> 00:38:07.030
Oh, Travis,
you smell so bad.


498
00:38:07.032 --> 00:38:09.366
When is the last time
you showered?


499
00:38:09.368 --> 00:38:12.402
Just get up,
change your shirt.
Come on get up, get up.


500
00:38:12.404 --> 00:38:14.237
Get up.

501
00:38:17.708 --> 00:38:21.111
I think that's clean.
Here.


502
00:38:28.319 --> 00:38:31.488
I need you
to give me the shirt...


503
00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:34.457
Oh, um, yeah, I'm...

504
00:38:35.559 --> 00:38:39.929
Um, just give me one second.

505
00:38:46.737 --> 00:38:49.406
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


506
00:38:49.408 --> 00:38:55.412
- How is Molly doing?
- Oh, uh, she's good.


507
00:38:55.414 --> 00:38:59.215
She, um, says hi and she misses
you and sends her love.


508
00:38:59.217 --> 00:39:02.419
- Really?
- No. Of course not,
she's a brat, Travis.


509
00:39:02.421 --> 00:39:07.390
- Uh-oh, someone's jealous.
- I'm jealous?


510
00:39:07.392 --> 00:39:09.726
Yeah, because you
want to be a cheerleader.


511
00:39:09.728 --> 00:39:14.464
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hmm?


512
00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.635
- What's that?
- What?


513
00:39:18.637 --> 00:39:21.771
I feel a breeze,

514
00:39:21.773 --> 00:39:24.240
it's in my knees,

515
00:39:24.242 --> 00:39:26.109
it's in my hips,
it's on my lips.


516
00:39:26.111 --> 00:39:28.111
Bang, bang, ding, ding,
come on Redhounds,
do your thing.


517
00:39:28.113 --> 00:39:30.613
You better
knock it off, or else.


518
00:39:30.615 --> 00:39:34.317
I could smack you.

519
00:39:37.455 --> 00:39:39.756
Ready?

520
00:39:39.758 --> 00:39:43.326
Dad? Ashley's here, sorry.

521
00:39:43.328 --> 00:39:45.995
Ashley.

522
00:39:58.275 --> 00:40:00.643
Guess who?

523
00:40:00.645 --> 00:40:04.180
Opposite foot, opposite foot,
it's like kicking the can.


524
00:40:04.182 --> 00:40:07.851
There you go, there you go.
Now, hold your
arm out straight.


525
00:40:07.853 --> 00:40:10.920
No, your cane arm out
straight, out straight.


526
00:40:10.922 --> 00:40:13.323
Hold your arm out straight,
there you go.


527
00:40:13.325 --> 00:40:16.159
Keep your head up,
keep your head up.


528
00:40:16.161 --> 00:40:18.862
- What's the point?
- Keep your head up.


529
00:40:24.668 --> 00:40:27.337
Opposite foot,
there you go.


530
00:40:27.339 --> 00:40:30.340
- Shirts on the right.
- Okay.


531
00:40:30.342 --> 00:40:31.808
Pants are on the left.

532
00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:36.012
Khakis and jeans,
feel the texture.


533
00:40:36.014 --> 00:40:39.382
- Keep your arm out straight.
- Why?


534
00:40:41.452 --> 00:40:43.720
You okay?

535
00:40:43.722 --> 00:40:46.489
Yes, ma'am,
arm out straight.


536
00:40:48.026 --> 00:40:49.225
Arm out straight.

537
00:40:49.227 --> 00:40:52.929
Let's go and find
the washer and dryer.


538
00:40:59.537 --> 00:41:03.706
- Ow!
- Son of a gun.


539
00:41:14.084 --> 00:41:16.586
- Keep your hand out.
- Sorry.


540
00:41:16.588 --> 00:41:20.023
$16.50 is your change.

541
00:41:20.025 --> 00:41:22.492
Would you mind counting
the bills out for me.


542
00:41:22.494 --> 00:41:24.160
Sure.

543
00:41:24.162 --> 00:41:27.597
That's ten, five and one.

544
00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:28.731
Thank you.

545
00:41:28.733 --> 00:41:31.434
So that's
your school, huh?


546
00:41:31.436 --> 00:41:32.502
Yeah.

547
00:41:32.504 --> 00:41:34.904
Gonna miss it.

548
00:41:34.906 --> 00:41:38.575
What about
your senior year?


549
00:41:38.577 --> 00:41:40.710
I guess I'll be going
to school for the blind.


550
00:41:40.712 --> 00:41:43.580
- Is that what you want?
- Do I have a choice?


551
00:42:15.946 --> 00:42:19.916
212 on your right,

552
00:42:53.517 --> 00:42:56.252
You can get your books
on audio tape.


553
00:42:56.254 --> 00:42:58.921
Your teachers can give you
your the tests orally.


554
00:42:58.923 --> 00:43:02.525
Hey, it's impolite to stand
with your back to the person
who you're talking to.


555
00:43:02.527 --> 00:43:05.294
- Sorry.
- Yeah. There won't
be anybody to guide you.


556
00:43:05.296 --> 00:43:08.665
- You'll be on your own.
- Good, because I don't
want any special treatment.


557
00:43:08.667 --> 00:43:11.701
No one's allowed in
school on a weekend
without special permission.


558
00:43:11.703 --> 00:43:14.804
Goodness, could've
sworn it was a Monday, my bad.


559
00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:43.366
Well, this is your stop.

560
00:43:45.202 --> 00:43:47.537
You're not
gonna walk me in?


561
00:43:48.806 --> 00:43:51.708
I have orders from Patty.

562
00:44:57.742 --> 00:44:58.975
Good morning, Travis.

563
00:44:58.977 --> 00:45:01.944
Welcome back.

564
00:45:01.946 --> 00:45:03.846
Thank you.

565
00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:08.985
- My man.
- Hey, what's up?


566
00:45:08.987 --> 00:45:11.287
- How you're doing?
- I'm good.


567
00:45:20.264 --> 00:45:23.366
Why don't you take a picture,
it'll last longer.


568
00:45:26.136 --> 00:45:28.304
Your first class is in what?

569
00:45:28.306 --> 00:45:29.972
- 213?
- 213.


570
00:45:29.974 --> 00:45:31.874
Should be right
here on the left.


571
00:45:33.977 --> 00:45:36.412
- What class is this?
- Calculus.


572
00:45:36.414 --> 00:45:38.915
- Where you are headed?
- I got sheet metal 101.


573
00:45:38.917 --> 00:45:43.452
- What class is that?
- AP, pre-prison,
taught by Duncan.


574
00:45:43.454 --> 00:45:45.988
See what happens
when you're not around?
Later.


575
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:47.690
Later.

576
00:45:54.298 --> 00:45:57.366
Drixen runs up the gut,
no, it's a fake.


577
00:45:57.368 --> 00:45:59.802
He's wide open.

578
00:45:59.804 --> 00:46:02.104
Jerry overthrew him, bad.

579
00:46:02.106 --> 00:46:03.472
What was that?

580
00:46:03.474 --> 00:46:05.675
Cover somebody, you got
to cover somebody, son.


581
00:46:05.677 --> 00:46:08.177
- Its cover three.
- Yes, sir.


582
00:46:08.179 --> 00:46:11.981
Baker, my niece can throw a ball
better than that and she's
only four years old.


583
00:46:11.983 --> 00:46:14.350
You content to be the
backup now, is that it, huh?


584
00:46:14.352 --> 00:46:16.352
Is Coach Farris
always this happy?


585
00:46:16.354 --> 00:46:18.020
If he didn't yell,
he didn't like you.


586
00:46:18.022 --> 00:46:21.057
All of you,
what the heck is wrong with you
people?


587
00:46:21.059 --> 00:46:24.594
Our first game is in ten days.

588
00:46:26.663 --> 00:46:27.964
That's it!

589
00:46:27.966 --> 00:46:29.298
I've had it with you all.

590
00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.534
Suicide drill, coach,
run it now!


591
00:46:31.536 --> 00:46:35.037
Let's go!
Line up on the goal line.


592
00:46:36.808 --> 00:46:39.508
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, on the hop.


593
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:42.545
Sounds like he really
likes the whole team.


594
00:46:42.547 --> 00:46:47.917
- Travis, how're you doing?
Ashley?
- Hey, Coach. How they looking?


595
00:46:47.919 --> 00:46:51.587
I don't know
that we're gonna win
a single game this year.


596
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:53.222
Coach, you say
that every year.


597
00:46:53.224 --> 00:46:55.524
Well, this year I mean it.

598
00:46:55.526 --> 00:46:58.094
You should let me play.

599
00:46:58.096 --> 00:46:59.662
Stop, I can keep up
with these guys.


600
00:46:59.664 --> 00:47:01.864
Well, can you
play corner,
'cause Mullins,


601
00:47:01.866 --> 00:47:05.067
he couldn't cover
a one-legged receiver.


602
00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:08.671
But he can hit, coach,
he can tackle, he's a mad man.


603
00:47:08.673 --> 00:47:10.873
Oh yeah, it's true.
That boy, he can hit.


604
00:47:10.875 --> 00:47:16.913
Maybe he could play safety.
Maybe Kenny'd play corner.


605
00:47:16.915 --> 00:47:18.648
He's pretty good
at cover too.


606
00:47:20.717 --> 00:47:21.851
Huh.

607
00:47:27.524 --> 00:47:30.126
Huh.

608
00:47:32.297 --> 00:47:36.232
Bring it in,
first team defense.


609
00:47:36.234 --> 00:47:40.269
We're going to try something.
Thanks, son.


610
00:47:40.271 --> 00:47:41.470
You're welcome.

611
00:47:41.472 --> 00:47:44.206
Mullins, you're
gonna move over to safety.


612
00:47:44.208 --> 00:47:46.876
Yes, safety!

613
00:47:49.379 --> 00:47:52.048
Smile any harder,
your face will fall off.


614
00:47:57.654 --> 00:48:00.389
All she did was say,
are there any cars coming,


615
00:48:00.391 --> 00:48:04.727
and I said I don't
see anything my way.


616
00:48:04.729 --> 00:48:07.129
And I started to go!
I did, I started to go!


617
00:48:07.131 --> 00:48:10.566
Oh, you won't be laughing
when the insurance goes up.


618
00:48:10.568 --> 00:48:13.536
It's not my fault.

619
00:48:14.571 --> 00:48:19.141
You miss it? Driving?

620
00:48:19.143 --> 00:48:22.478
Keep it straight, no, no,
little left, little left.


621
00:48:24.749 --> 00:48:27.850
Sorry, student driver.
We'll work on that.


622
00:48:27.852 --> 00:48:31.454
Right, little right.
Okay, go slow, hold it,
hold, it's Duncan.


623
00:48:31.456 --> 00:48:35.057
- Where?
- Twenty feet
up here on the left.


624
00:48:38.161 --> 00:48:42.832
Oh, hey there, Mr. Duncan.
I almost didn't see you.


625
00:48:55.612 --> 00:48:58.714
- Right, right, right.
- Quick, take this wheel.


626
00:48:58.716 --> 00:49:02.485
Oh, that was great.
Are you serious?


627
00:49:02.487 --> 00:49:04.787
Did you see his...
no, you didn't see his face.


628
00:49:04.789 --> 00:49:09.158
Willard, I am a great
believer in beginnings.


629
00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.461
Winners start strong.

630
00:49:14.031 --> 00:49:17.333
Seems to me like you need to
switch things up a little bit.


631
00:49:17.335 --> 00:49:20.002
Try a new variety of plays.

632
00:49:20.004 --> 00:49:22.371
Well, thank you, Jasper,

633
00:49:22.373 --> 00:49:24.206
I'll certainly take that
under consideration.


634
00:49:24.208 --> 00:49:28.577
Now, I've got
some plays that I've been
drawing up in my office.


635
00:49:28.579 --> 00:49:31.380
I'd like you to take
a look at them.


636
00:49:54.871 --> 00:49:58.741
<i>Corbin lost</i>
<i>this game in the trenches.</i>


637
00:49:58.743 --> 00:50:01.343
<i>Their defense has played well,</i>
<i>especially their secondary,</i>


638
00:50:01.345 --> 00:50:04.380
<i>but they've got to find a spot</i>
<i>for their running game.</i>


639
00:50:04.382 --> 00:50:07.750
<i>Their line has</i>
<i>got to dominate.</i>


640
00:50:07.752 --> 00:50:12.054
<i>Tonight they didn't.</i>
<i>Riley was sacked four times.</i>


641
00:50:12.056 --> 00:50:14.957
<i>Hate to lose the first</i>
<i>game of the season.</i>


642
00:50:14.959 --> 00:50:18.594
<i>Boy howdy,</i>
<i>hate to lose the first one.</i>


643
00:50:26.603 --> 00:50:30.306
- Can I get you anything?
- Nah, no, nothing.


644
00:50:30.308 --> 00:50:33.676
Nothing, thanks, coach.

645
00:50:34.978 --> 00:50:38.614
Just one game,
we'll get 'em next week.


646
00:50:38.616 --> 00:50:41.851
Offensive line
isn't together.


647
00:50:45.288 --> 00:50:47.289
Defense played well.

648
00:50:47.291 --> 00:50:49.758
Yeah, yeah, they did.

649
00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:53.662
Switching Harris
and Mullins,


650
00:50:53.664 --> 00:50:56.132
that was a great i..

651
00:51:08.478 --> 00:51:11.714
You got a funny
look in your eye.


652
00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:14.783
Willard.

653
00:51:14.785 --> 00:51:16.619
<i>Not a good coach.</i>

654
00:51:16.621 --> 00:51:19.288
<i>Farris is not good for Corbin.</i>

655
00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:20.623
Come in.

656
00:51:20.625 --> 00:51:23.526
<i>Coach</i>
<i>Willard Farris must go.</i>


657
00:51:23.528 --> 00:51:25.661
Travis? How you doing, son?

658
00:51:25.663 --> 00:51:27.663
Hey, Coach!

659
00:51:30.268 --> 00:51:33.536
Making out all right?
Classes, school all right?


660
00:51:33.538 --> 00:51:36.839
- Yeah, no, they're all right.
- Good.


661
00:51:36.841 --> 00:51:40.276
- I'm a sit down.
- Please.


662
00:51:40.278 --> 00:51:42.077
Yeah.

663
00:51:47.551 --> 00:51:50.186
How is the team doing?

664
00:51:50.188 --> 00:51:51.954
Umm, the guys are okay.

665
00:51:51.956 --> 00:51:54.557
They're glad two-a-days are
done, I'll tell you that much.


666
00:51:54.559 --> 00:51:56.959
Two-a-days.
Oh, that sounds great.


667
00:51:58.728 --> 00:52:02.798
Look, Travis,
I wanted to talk to you
about something.


668
00:52:08.305 --> 00:52:12.508
Travis, I'm thinking you
should come back on the team.


669
00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:15.544
Oh...

670
00:52:15.546 --> 00:52:17.913
You mean like you
want me to help out with
equipment or something?


671
00:52:17.915 --> 00:52:21.550
- That'd be fine.
- No, no, no, that's not exactly
what I was thinking.


672
00:52:21.552 --> 00:52:24.653
What exactly
were you thinking?


673
00:52:24.655 --> 00:52:27.323
I think you should play.

674
00:52:27.325 --> 00:52:31.627
- Play? Play what?
- Football.


675
00:52:35.398 --> 00:52:36.865
I don't, I don't understand.

676
00:52:36.867 --> 00:52:42.871
Look, I've seen you
the past two weeks
watching practice.


677
00:52:42.873 --> 00:52:46.408
Travis, I never coached
a boy loves football
as much as you do.


678
00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:49.845
Its impossible, coach,
I can't catch the ball.
I can't see it.


679
00:52:49.847 --> 00:52:51.447
Well, that's right,
of course you can't.


680
00:52:51.449 --> 00:52:54.250
- So you are going to have
to play center.
- Center?


681
00:52:54.252 --> 00:52:57.453
That's right,
center, think about it.
Think about it.


682
00:52:57.455 --> 00:53:00.923
Listen, all you got to do is,
you're not going to have to


683
00:53:00.925 --> 00:53:02.291
pull block
or anything like that.


684
00:53:02.293 --> 00:53:04.760
You got to snap the ball
and you got to take out


685
00:53:04.762 --> 00:53:06.929
the nose tackle,
who's just foot in front of you.


686
00:53:06.931 --> 00:53:10.199
He'll probably find you.
Travis, all you've got to do...


687
00:53:10.201 --> 00:53:12.268
All right, stand up, come on.
Stand up.


688
00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:13.936
- Okay.
- Here you go.


689
00:53:13.938 --> 00:53:15.871
Square up now,
put your hands up.


690
00:53:15.873 --> 00:53:17.773
Put your hands up,
put them on me.


691
00:53:17.775 --> 00:53:19.742
Okay, and your feet, you want
to spread your feet apart


692
00:53:19.744 --> 00:53:21.143
a little bit so you
got some balance.


693
00:53:21.145 --> 00:53:23.078
When you move, you're
going to move laterally, right?


694
00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:26.148
You're not a gazelle
anymore, you're a pitbull.


695
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:29.551
- Okay.
- You just move with me,
you keep your hands on me.


696
00:53:29.553 --> 00:53:32.454
If I go right, yeah.
You've got to protect
your quarterback.


697
00:53:32.456 --> 00:53:35.391
Yeah, move them feet,
move them feet,
put your hands on me.


698
00:53:35.393 --> 00:53:38.394
Keep them on me, understand?
That's it, just keep coming,
keep coming,


699
00:53:38.396 --> 00:53:41.897
and all the time
I'm coming this way,
that's how I want to...


700
00:53:41.899 --> 00:53:44.800
- How about that?
- Ooh.


701
00:53:44.802 --> 00:53:46.735
You don't need your sight
for that, now do you?


702
00:53:46.737 --> 00:53:49.938
- No, sir.
- Well?


703
00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:54.710
You're serious?

704
00:53:58.982 --> 00:54:01.317
- All right, listen.
- I don't know.


705
00:54:01.319 --> 00:54:02.985
You think about it.

706
00:54:02.987 --> 00:54:05.421
You take the weekend, you talk
about it with your folks,


707
00:54:05.423 --> 00:54:08.957
and if you do decide that
you want to give it try,


708
00:54:08.959 --> 00:54:12.461
I'll expect you on my football
field, Monday afternoon.


709
00:54:12.463 --> 00:54:16.198
- All right?
- Yeah.


710
00:54:18.968 --> 00:54:20.836
Coach?

711
00:54:26.643 --> 00:54:28.777
What if I can't?

712
00:54:30.447 --> 00:54:32.848
I'll see you Monday.

713
00:55:31.241 --> 00:55:35.177
The Lord is
my light and my salvation.


714
00:55:35.179 --> 00:55:37.079
Whom shall I fear.

715
00:55:37.081 --> 00:55:39.681
I want to welcome
you all out this morning.


716
00:55:39.683 --> 00:55:41.517
So glad you all could be here.

717
00:55:41.519 --> 00:55:44.686
As I begin this morning,
I want to ask everyone in here


718
00:55:44.688 --> 00:55:48.056
to close your eyes
for a moment,


719
00:55:48.058 --> 00:55:51.760
everyone except for my friend
here in the front row.


720
00:55:51.762 --> 00:55:55.130
You can keep your eyes open.

721
00:55:58.601 --> 00:56:04.273
Now, how would you respond
if someone came in here


722
00:56:04.275 --> 00:56:07.276
and told you that what
you see right now


723
00:56:07.278 --> 00:56:11.413
is what you're going to see
for the rest of your life.


724
00:56:15.486 --> 00:56:18.120
How would you respond
if someone told you that you'd


725
00:56:18.122 --> 00:56:21.957
never see the light
of day again?


726
00:56:21.959 --> 00:56:24.927
Would you be angry?

727
00:56:24.929 --> 00:56:27.563
Would you be bitter?

728
00:56:27.565 --> 00:56:28.931
Who is that?

729
00:56:28.933 --> 00:56:34.336
Would you blame
God and ask, why me?


730
00:56:35.271 --> 00:56:38.907
Or maybe beneath all
of those questions,


731
00:56:38.909 --> 00:56:43.612
all of that emotion
is simply fear.


732
00:56:43.614 --> 00:56:49.551
Fear of what your
life might be?


733
00:56:50.854 --> 00:56:53.622
Who are you,
ask yourself.


734
00:56:53.624 --> 00:56:55.257
Who are you?

735
00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:06.268
I'm Travis Freeman.

736
00:57:08.004 --> 00:57:11.006
Mom! Dad!
I'm Travis Freeman!


737
00:57:11.008 --> 00:57:15.377
- You're what?
- Oh, honey.


738
00:57:15.379 --> 00:57:17.546
I'm gonna play football!

739
00:57:26.724 --> 00:57:31.260
- Bring it in!
- Let's go. Oh the hop.


740
00:57:32.896 --> 00:57:34.863
A player's
gonna join the team.


741
00:57:34.865 --> 00:57:36.398
Where's he from?

742
00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:40.269
- Right here in Corbin.
- Who is he?


743
00:57:43.039 --> 00:57:46.041
No way! Really?

744
00:57:46.043 --> 00:57:48.577
Yup. It's Travis.

745
00:57:48.579 --> 00:57:52.714
- How's that even possible?
- What position?


746
00:57:52.716 --> 00:57:54.917
- Center.
- No, no, no.


747
00:57:54.919 --> 00:57:56.718
Cameron,
you're moving to guard.


748
00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:00.222
Kyle, you're our new
short yardage fullback,
congratulations.


749
00:58:00.224 --> 00:58:03.725
Cameron, you'll still be
making the line calls,


750
00:58:03.727 --> 00:58:07.462
and you are going signal Travis
where his man lines up.


751
00:58:08.898 --> 00:58:12.501
I think he deserves a chance.

752
00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:20.742
- Big day.
- Yes.


753
00:58:20.744 --> 00:58:24.012
- Is Mary here?
- She's over there.


754
00:58:24.014 --> 00:58:27.449
Well, at least she came.

755
00:58:27.451 --> 00:58:30.185
Excuse me.

756
00:58:32.021 --> 00:58:35.657
It's not a good idea.

757
00:58:37.961 --> 00:58:43.498
- Hello.
- Hello.


758
00:58:44.233 --> 00:58:46.101
So you agreed
to let him play?


759
00:58:46.103 --> 00:58:49.104
Agreed? It doesn't
matter what I say.


760
00:58:49.106 --> 00:58:50.606
I'm just the mother.

761
00:58:50.608 --> 00:58:54.643
They can bash
themselves senseless.
It's not up to me.


762
00:58:57.948 --> 00:59:01.883
- How's this even going to work?
- Don't worry about it.
He ain't gonna play.


763
00:59:01.885 --> 00:59:04.553
- My dad took care of it.
- What? How?


764
00:59:04.555 --> 00:59:07.422
I told him
about it last night,
and he called Mr. Duncan.


765
00:59:07.424 --> 00:59:10.726
All right.
Let's go! Let's go!


766
00:59:10.728 --> 00:59:15.731
I want to see Special teams
out on the field.
On the hop, let's go!


767
00:59:17.834 --> 00:59:20.168
Travis, there's a problem.

768
00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:22.471
Blind? In the middle
of all that mayhem.


769
00:59:22.473 --> 00:59:25.674
If something happened to him,
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself.


770
00:59:25.676 --> 00:59:30.612
Not to mention the
school's liability.
So, no.


771
00:59:30.614 --> 00:59:34.149
- Well, it's not your call!
- You can't stop him
from playing football!


772
00:59:34.151 --> 00:59:40.122
I can and I will.
I'm the Athletic Director,
and my word is gospel.


773
00:59:40.124 --> 00:59:43.158
- Gospel, huh?
You sure about that?
- Yes, I am.


774
00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:45.594
Travis Freeman will
not play football.


775
00:59:45.596 --> 00:59:50.065
Okay, you all heard him.
Oh, by the way,
who's your lawyer?


776
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.536
My... my...
my what, my lawyer?


777
00:59:54.538 --> 00:59:58.206
In accordance with the
Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act of 1990,


778
00:59:58.208 --> 01:00:02.678
the state of Kentucky is bound
to offer an equal opportunity
to participate in any school


779
01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:04.780
sanctioned functions to any
child with a disability.


780
01:00:04.782 --> 01:00:06.948
- Well, hang on a second.
- I will alert your principal


781
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:08.884
that your actions have
put your school in direct
conflict


782
01:00:08.886 --> 01:00:11.019
with the federal government,
and advise him to expect


783
01:00:11.021 --> 01:00:13.655
the National Guard to shut
and padlock the school doors
in the morning.


784
01:00:13.657 --> 01:00:17.359
Now, hold on now.
I'm not breaking any laws.


785
01:00:17.361 --> 01:00:19.861
We have regulations...
I, look, it's, uh...


786
01:00:19.863 --> 01:00:23.532
If I were you,
I'd clear my schedule
for the next few months.


787
01:00:23.534 --> 01:00:26.368
You and your boss might be
spending time in jail.


788
01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:30.338
Jail! You'll lock me...
No, hang on.


789
01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:32.040
Every player needs this form.

790
01:00:32.042 --> 01:00:36.678
I looked it up, this form signed
by his parents
allowing him to play.


791
01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:40.482
- I signed that already!
- Both. Both parents
need to sign it.


792
01:00:40.484 --> 01:00:44.886
Now, I believe that Mrs. Freeman
has the same doubts that I have.


793
01:00:44.888 --> 01:00:46.688
Isn't that true,
Mrs. Freeman?


794
01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:49.891
- Oh, that was a bad move.
- Excuse me?


795
01:00:51.728 --> 01:00:53.328
Larry...

796
01:00:55.898 --> 01:00:58.533
...you got a pen?

797
01:00:58.535 --> 01:01:01.737
Well, you folks
will excuse us.


798
01:01:01.739 --> 01:01:04.706
- Travis, coach, let's go.
- Thank you, Larry.


799
01:01:04.708 --> 01:01:07.743
Come on, son.

800
01:01:07.745 --> 01:01:12.247
Let's go. East west.
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.


801
01:01:16.786 --> 01:01:19.421
National Guard?
Padlocks?


802
01:01:19.423 --> 01:01:22.958
Maybe I exaggerated a bit.

803
01:01:28.532 --> 01:01:30.332
Trav!

804
01:01:31.234 --> 01:01:35.303
Set! Hut!

805
01:01:35.305 --> 01:01:38.373
You see? You see that?

806
01:01:38.375 --> 01:01:41.977
It's a distraction, that was
the last thing these boys need.


807
01:01:41.979 --> 01:01:44.479
You gonna let it happen?

808
01:01:44.481 --> 01:01:48.116
I can't do nothing about it.
She said it's against the law.


809
01:01:48.118 --> 01:01:53.421
She said it's some civil
liberties or civil
something, it's bad.


810
01:01:53.423 --> 01:01:56.324
All right, try it again.

811
01:01:56.326 --> 01:01:58.126
- Where?
- Come back a little.


812
01:01:58.128 --> 01:02:00.228
- Here?
- Yeah.


813
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:03.165
Let's go.

814
01:02:03.167 --> 01:02:04.900
Down!

815
01:02:04.902 --> 01:02:07.102
Set!

816
01:02:07.104 --> 01:02:09.571
Hut!

817
01:02:09.573 --> 01:02:11.807
- Come on Freeman.
- What?


818
01:02:11.809 --> 01:02:14.843
Hut! Hut! Hut!

819
01:02:33.462 --> 01:02:39.134
Get back in line,
you'll get it. You'll get it.


820
01:02:39.136 --> 01:02:42.771
I mean, he can't
really play, right?


821
01:02:52.014 --> 01:02:54.049
Good job, good job, good job.

822
01:02:54.051 --> 01:02:57.018
- There you go.
- Put me in.


823
01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:59.621
- Really?
- Yeah, put me in.


824
01:03:01.691 --> 01:03:03.959
- Right here?
- Shoulder width.
Yeah, yeah, I got you lined up.


825
01:03:03.961 --> 01:03:06.962
You're good. He is right
in front of you, all right?


826
01:03:06.964 --> 01:03:08.563
Stay low.

827
01:03:08.565 --> 01:03:12.601
You want to play center?
Well, get through me.


828
01:03:17.507 --> 01:03:20.475
- Put that in the paper.
- I oughta take your head off.


829
01:03:20.477 --> 01:03:23.211
- Come on!
- It can't happen in the game.


830
01:03:23.213 --> 01:03:26.214
- You coward!
- You shut it too. That
just cost you 20 laps.


831
01:03:26.216 --> 01:03:29.885
You too, Baker. Coach,
you see they run every inch,
or they'll do it again.


832
01:03:29.887 --> 01:03:34.155
- Yes, sir, coach.
- All right let's go.


833
01:03:34.157 --> 01:03:36.391
He side-stepped you, man.

834
01:03:36.393 --> 01:03:41.463
Whoa, whoa, whoa! That's it,
that's enough for today.
You take it in, go on.


835
01:03:44.867 --> 01:03:47.936
Let's get two more in,
let's go, let's go, let's go.


836
01:04:05.121 --> 01:04:06.721
Hey, coach.

837
01:04:06.723 --> 01:04:09.925
You don't think he's serious
about Travis playing, do you?


838
01:04:09.927 --> 01:04:13.128
- That's what he said.
- He's losing it.


839
01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:15.397
I can't wait to
get to college ball.


840
01:04:15.399 --> 01:04:18.400
- No cripple-charity there.
- Are you high?


841
01:04:18.402 --> 01:04:20.535
Ain't nobody giving you
a damn scholarship.


842
01:04:20.537 --> 01:04:22.938
Just watch me, loser!
They love me!


843
01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.773
- I got three schools
fighting over me.
- You're crazy.


844
01:04:24.775 --> 01:04:27.909
- Are you that dense?
- What?


845
01:04:27.911 --> 01:04:29.044
You know coach.

846
01:04:29.046 --> 01:04:31.613
He says he's gonna
do something, he does it.


847
01:04:31.615 --> 01:04:36.084
If Travis plays badly,
the whole offensive
line looks bad.


848
01:04:36.086 --> 01:04:39.321
- And if the line looks bad...
- Wait a minute.


849
01:04:39.323 --> 01:04:42.924
Yeah, Travis better learned
how to play center,


850
01:04:42.926 --> 01:04:45.827
or you can kiss
that scholarship goodbye!


851
01:04:53.836 --> 01:04:55.503
What?

852
01:04:58.408 --> 01:05:00.775
Psst. Hey, mouse knuckle.

853
01:05:00.777 --> 01:05:04.279
What, who is it?
- It's me, fool!


854
01:05:04.281 --> 01:05:07.716
What?

855
01:05:10.186 --> 01:05:11.820
- Jerry?
- Yeah.


856
01:05:11.822 --> 01:05:13.822
What are you doing, man?
What time is it?


857
01:05:13.824 --> 01:05:15.957
Don't worry about it,
get some clothes on.


858
01:05:15.959 --> 01:05:18.660
- Grab your cleats.
We're meeting somebody.
- Who?


859
01:05:18.662 --> 01:05:21.029
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.


860
01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.867
- Geez!
- Easy, easy, easy.


861
01:05:25.869 --> 01:05:27.702
Mind telling me
where you're taking me?


862
01:05:27.704 --> 01:05:31.106
Jerry! Oh my gosh, clean out
your truck, this thing is nasty.


863
01:05:31.108 --> 01:05:33.341
- Ashley.
- Hi.


864
01:05:33.343 --> 01:05:37.278
- You know what's going on?
- No, not me,
this is Jerry's idea.


865
01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:40.015
I ain't gonna have
you looking like crap out there.
You're better than that.


866
01:05:40.017 --> 01:05:42.550
You're going to get this
center thing down, tonight.


867
01:05:42.552 --> 01:05:45.687
- Jerry...
- Let's go!


868
01:05:45.689 --> 01:05:48.390
Is that moving?
Oh my gosh, that's moving!


869
01:05:48.392 --> 01:05:50.025
- What's going on?
- Whoa, whoa!


870
01:06:00.703 --> 01:06:04.639
- You guys are late.
- Cameron?
What are you doing here?


871
01:06:04.641 --> 01:06:07.609
I'm asking myself
the same thing.


872
01:06:11.714 --> 01:06:13.615
Come on.

873
01:06:17.887 --> 01:06:23.091
Hey, no beer tonight.
This is about him.


874
01:06:23.093 --> 01:06:25.794
It's always about him.

875
01:06:28.764 --> 01:06:30.498
Come on.

876
01:06:42.045 --> 01:06:45.013
Farris is putting you in a game,
so I ain't going to let you
make me look bad


877
01:06:45.015 --> 01:06:47.082
by stinking up in the field.
Got it?


878
01:06:47.084 --> 01:06:50.919
Aw, I think he
kind of likes you.
Shut up, Baker!


879
01:06:52.521 --> 01:06:56.191
First, Travis,
get in your stance.


880
01:06:56.193 --> 01:07:00.061
Wider, you got to have room
between your legs for that snap.
Come on!


881
01:07:00.063 --> 01:07:01.429
- Hey!
- Whoa!


882
01:07:01.431 --> 01:07:02.697
What, are you going
to teach him something,


883
01:07:02.699 --> 01:07:09.437
you washed-up 2nd stringer?
All right.


884
01:07:09.439 --> 01:07:11.940
Now look, Travis, you
got to use your feet.


885
01:07:11.942 --> 01:07:14.909
Your feet need to be wider apart
than they normally used to.


886
01:07:14.911 --> 01:07:17.378
Feel your balance
through your cleats.


887
01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:19.747
Get down.

888
01:07:19.749 --> 01:07:23.451
Now on the balls of your feet,
you're moving forward. Good.


889
01:07:23.453 --> 01:07:27.589
Now dig in.
Good, good, good.


890
01:07:27.591 --> 01:07:31.459
Not bad, not bad.

891
01:07:31.461 --> 01:07:33.628
Now try it with the ball.

892
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:37.031
Here, there is the ball.

893
01:07:38.901 --> 01:07:40.802
No, he can't do that.
You can't pick the ball up.


894
01:07:40.804 --> 01:07:44.606
It's all right,
just try it again.


895
01:07:44.608 --> 01:07:46.307
Just roll it to
find the laces.


896
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:49.911
Sweep, good.

897
01:07:49.913 --> 01:07:52.981
Get your other hand
ready to fire out.


898
01:07:52.983 --> 01:07:55.016
Dig in.

899
01:07:56.285 --> 01:07:58.820
- Yeah?
- Let's try a snap.


900
01:07:58.822 --> 01:08:01.422
Here.

901
01:08:01.424 --> 01:08:04.259
You fart and I'll kill you.

902
01:08:04.261 --> 01:08:05.994
Hut.

903
01:08:05.996 --> 01:08:08.263
- Aw, damn!
- You okay? Sorry, sorry.


904
01:08:08.265 --> 01:08:10.965
Aw, he's fine.
Will you shake it off,

905
01:08:10.967 --> 01:08:12.333
You better cut
the 2nd string crap.


906
01:08:12.335 --> 01:08:13.635
What are you
going to do about it?


907
01:08:13.637 --> 01:08:15.103

to throw water on you all?


908

Come on.

909
01:08:18.275 --> 01:08:19.674
Go on and try it again.

910
01:08:19.676 --> 01:08:23.611
Just gonna keep it slow,
get the motion down first.


911
01:08:24.813 --> 01:08:28.283
Hut. Slow, you guys always
have to rush things.


912
01:08:28.285 --> 01:08:30.318
No, stop, stop,
I got it.


913
01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:32.921
All right.

914
01:08:33.689 --> 01:08:35.623
Here it is,
try it again.


915

Hey.

916
01:08:42.198 --> 01:08:44.098
Relax.

917
01:08:50.206 --> 01:08:52.240
Hut.

918

Hut.

920
01:08:56.079 --> 01:08:58.313

Set. Hut!

925
01:09:22.905 --> 01:09:24.706
You know, I could
have gone out, had coffee


926
01:09:24.708 --> 01:09:28.810
and come back in the time it
took you to snap that ball.
Do it again.

Look, look, you see?

944
01:11:40.744 --> 01:11:43.378
I am telling you,
Coach Farris is crazy!


945

What?

963
01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.336
- Where you been, man?
- Here.


964
01:14:22.338 --> 01:14:26.073
You weren't at practice.
Where were you?


965

Don't need it.
Don't play.

- What did you say?
- Nothing.

Come on man, we're going
to grab a bite at the depot.

Nah, you go ahead,
I'm good where I am.

You drinking?
Right out here?


970
01:14:49.432 --> 01:14:52.033
This ain't drinking.
It's my after school job.


971
01:14:52.035 --> 01:14:53.568
I smell beer.

972
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:56.070
I'm double checking
the expiration dates.


973
01:14:56.072 --> 01:14:58.339
Are you trying to
get kicked off the team?


974
01:14:58.341 --> 01:15:01.876
What team?
Since fifth grade,


975
01:15:01.878 --> 01:15:05.079
it's always been about
Travis Freeman.


976
01:15:05.081 --> 01:15:07.915
So go, go, big man.

977
01:15:07.917 --> 01:15:10.585
Mr. Everything.

978
01:15:10.587 --> 01:15:12.553
Ain't that what the
paper used to call you?


979
01:15:12.555 --> 01:15:14.922
Why do you do this?

980
01:15:14.924 --> 01:15:17.258
You really have
no idea, do you?


981
01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:20.294
- It's so easy for you.
- Easy for me? I'm blind!


982
01:15:20.296 --> 01:15:23.931
Yeah, but, did that stop you?
For one second?


983
01:15:23.933 --> 01:15:26.267
No! It didn't.

984
01:15:26.269 --> 01:15:29.370
You play, you get grades,
you go to college.


985
01:15:29.372 --> 01:15:31.872
- Cut it out, Jerry.
- You do it all.


986
01:15:31.874 --> 01:15:35.776
What am I missing? Huh? Why?

987
01:15:35.778 --> 01:15:38.679
I can't talk
to you like this.


988

Hey, you want to
know why I drink?


989

What's the problem, ref?

997
01:16:11.314 --> 01:16:12.947
Coach, we've got blood.
He's got to sit out a play.


998
01:16:12.949 --> 01:16:14.649
- I'm fine!
- You're my dang center.

- Let's go.

1031
01:19:01.150 --> 01:19:04.318
- Can it wait?
- I won't keep you long.


1032

- Hey, Coach.


1033
01:19:10.293 --> 01:19:13.127
- How's Freddie making out?
- His leg's broke.


1034
01:19:13.129 --> 01:19:17.865
He's in traction for
the next couple of weeks.
But he's still making jokes.


1035
01:19:17.867 --> 01:19:20.835
You tell him I'll be by
to see him again next week.


1036
01:19:20.837 --> 01:19:22.837
I was just telling Karen
and Mr. Marshall here


1037
01:19:22.839 --> 01:19:25.539
how I tried to keep
Travis Freeman from playing.


1038
01:19:25.541 --> 01:19:28.342
Well, I think Travis has
as much right to play as...


1039
01:19:28.344 --> 01:19:30.678
He doesn't have any right
to put those kids in danger!


1040
01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:33.147
Freddie would be starting
tonight if it wasn't
for that boy!


1041
01:19:33.149 --> 01:19:36.851
I'm afraid I agree.
Now, I want your word you
will not play that boy again.


1042
01:19:36.853 --> 01:19:39.720
- Are we done here?
- I want your word.


1043
01:19:39.722 --> 01:19:44.291
Look, folks,
I'm sorry about Freddie,


1044
01:19:44.293 --> 01:19:46.527
but I don't blame
Travis for it.


1045
01:19:46.529 --> 01:19:49.897
It was a missed block,
it happens all the time.


1046
01:19:49.899 --> 01:19:55.603
You have a good game, because
it's going to be your last.


1047
01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:09.250
Well, that's
not for you to say,
is it, Mr. Marshall?


1048
01:20:09.252 --> 01:20:10.651
But I'll tell
you something.


1049
01:20:10.653 --> 01:20:13.888
If it is my last game,
win or lose,


1050
01:20:13.890 --> 01:20:17.625
it's mine, not yours.

1051
01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:21.829
And it's not yours
neither, Jasper.


1052
01:20:21.831 --> 01:20:26.967
So from now on just keep
your plays to yourself
and stay off my football field.


1053
01:20:27.702 --> 01:20:28.836
Karen.

1054
01:20:34.109 --> 01:20:36.110
We got through to him.

1055
01:20:50.692 --> 01:20:52.493
What's...

1056
01:20:53.595 --> 01:20:56.096
Whoa, ho, ho!
Oh, yeah!


1057
01:20:56.098 --> 01:20:58.966
Whoo-hoo!

1058
01:20:59.601 --> 01:21:02.269
- Jerry?
- Shut up.


1059
01:21:02.271 --> 01:21:03.370
You see what your doing?

1060
01:21:03.372 --> 01:21:05.306
Go, kick butt, Trav, go.

1061
01:21:05.308 --> 01:21:06.573
I will now.

1062
01:21:18.987 --> 01:21:23.824
- Are we still talking?
- Well, that depends.


1063
01:21:23.826 --> 01:21:25.225
On what?

1064
01:21:31.299 --> 01:21:32.566
Here, I want you
to have this.


1065
01:21:32.568 --> 01:21:35.069
What? What is it?

1066
01:21:35.071 --> 01:21:37.638
It's that picture of us
they took when we were kids
in the end zone,


1067
01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:39.173
- the one they put in the paper?
- Why are you giving this to me?


1068
01:21:39.175 --> 01:21:40.975
We signed it, man,
we were going
to sell it one day and...


1069
01:21:40.977 --> 01:21:44.445
- Why, Jerry?
- I owe you.


1070
01:21:44.447 --> 01:21:48.082
- You owe me for what?
- I'm starting.


1071
01:21:50.685 --> 01:21:52.653
Do you think I let
Freddie get hurt for you?


1072
01:21:52.655 --> 01:21:56.957
- That's not what I...
- You think coach
wants to start you?


1073
01:21:56.959 --> 01:22:00.327
You're the best quarterback
I've ever seen,
and he doesn't want to use you.


1074
01:22:00.329 --> 01:22:03.831
He doesn't have a choice!

1075
01:22:03.833 --> 01:22:06.100
Travis, you're
not hearing me, okay?


1076
01:22:06.102 --> 01:22:10.904
Jerry, coach wants to see you.

1077
01:22:27.155 --> 01:22:31.658
Come on in.

1078
01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:33.761
Close it, park yourself.

1079
01:22:37.365 --> 01:22:40.534
I finally got through
to your ma at the hospital.


1080
01:22:40.536 --> 01:22:42.369
She has to work
a double shift.


1081
01:22:42.371 --> 01:22:44.505
Why should this game
be any different?


1082
01:22:44.507 --> 01:22:47.775
She said to
wish you good luck.


1083
01:22:52.013 --> 01:22:53.714
You know, she works hard.

1084
01:22:53.716 --> 01:22:58.419
She keeps that place running,
with all the doctors, nurses,


1085
01:22:58.421 --> 01:23:00.554
and aides, they do just
what she tells them to do.


1086
01:23:00.556 --> 01:23:05.793
And she never has
to raise her voice.
I admire that.


1087
01:23:13.034 --> 01:23:15.235
Coach...

1088
01:23:15.237 --> 01:23:17.871
...are you...

1089
01:23:17.873 --> 01:23:21.141
Are you starting me
just because you have to?


1090
01:23:23.745 --> 01:23:26.847
Don't you know me by now?

1091
01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:31.518
Hm?

1092
01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:34.021
Go on, get ready to play.

1093
01:23:35.023 --> 01:23:36.223
Yes, sir.

1094
01:23:55.944 --> 01:23:57.945
<i>Deep in</i>
<i>the fourth quarter,</i>


1095
01:23:57.947 --> 01:24:01.248
<i>and Corbin finds itself behind</i>
<i>in this must-win game.</i>


1096
01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:03.217
Full trips right,

1097
01:24:03.219 --> 01:24:05.085
<i>But the Redhounds</i>
<i>are threatening.</i>


1098
01:24:10.959 --> 01:24:12.092
Watch 27.

1099
01:24:12.094 --> 01:24:13.393
We need a win.

1100
01:24:13.395 --> 01:24:15.462
We need to play some
football now, all right.


1101
01:24:15.464 --> 01:24:16.763
Right 27.

1102
01:24:16.765 --> 01:24:19.233
Kentucky, Kentucky.

1103
01:24:19.235 --> 01:24:21.435
Down.

1104

1105
01:24:23.239 --> 01:24:25.405
Ready, team!

1106
01:24:25.407 --> 01:24:27.307
Set. Hut.

1107
01:24:39.587 --> 01:24:43.323
- Right 4 right, 80, all stop.
- Yes, sir.


1108
01:24:45.161 --> 01:24:47.461
<i>Corbin</i>
<i>needs a touchdown.</i>


1109
01:24:47.463 --> 01:24:52.166
<i>Three points and a tie doesn't</i>
<i>get them in the playoffs.</i>


1110
01:24:52.168 --> 01:24:54.234
27.

1111
01:24:56.671 --> 01:24:58.772
Come on, son, run the play.

1112
01:24:58.774 --> 01:25:02.276
Black 18, black 18.

1114
01:25:10.185 --> 01:25:13.187
<i>Drixon</i>
<i>good for 7 yards.</i>


1115
01:25:15.691 --> 01:25:17.858
One timeout left, coach.

1116
01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:20.527
<i>Drixon is hobbling</i>
<i>back to the huddle.</i>


1117
01:25:20.529 --> 01:25:22.196
<i>He's had a big game tonight.</i>

1118
01:25:22.198 --> 01:25:24.531
<i>Farris has been working him</i>

1119
01:25:24.533 --> 01:25:25.566
<i>like his brother-in-law's mule.</i>

1120
01:25:28.804 --> 01:25:31.004
<i>Farris</i>
<i>is letting the clock run.</i>


1121
01:25:31.006 --> 01:25:33.540
<i>He is not going to leave</i>

1122
01:25:33.542 --> 01:25:36.643
<i>in case the Redhounds</i>
<i>can score.</i>


1123
01:25:38.213 --> 01:25:40.547
<i>Baker's got time.</i>

1124
01:25:40.549 --> 01:25:42.149
<i>He's going for it all.</i>

1125
01:25:42.151 --> 01:25:45.018
<i>Oh, sugar!</i>

1126
01:25:47.556 --> 01:25:51.725
Boy, I tell you this
game's just making that
tri-tip just... hmmm.


1127
01:25:51.727 --> 01:25:53.660
<i>The clock stops</i>
<i>with 34 seconds</i>


1128

- You okay, man?
- I'm good.


1129

<i>Corbin has</i>
<i>just one timeout left.</i>

bullets left, zip.

1131

- Yes, sir.
- Go on.

<i>He's down to the 15.</i>

You all right, man?
You okay? Come on.


1152
01:27:10.906 --> 01:27:13.140
Coach, he's done.

1153
01:27:13.142 --> 01:27:15.409
All right,
well, you take a seat, son.


1154
01:27:15.411 --> 01:27:19.112
Offense! Bring it in.

1155
01:27:19.114 --> 01:27:25.085
- Twins left, 48 sweep.
- All right.


1156
01:27:27.855 --> 01:27:29.623
Kyle, I am going to need you
to run the ball.


1157
01:27:29.625 --> 01:27:34.161
- Yes, sir.
- Freeman,
you got one last play in you?


1158
01:27:34.163 --> 01:27:35.329
You kidding?

1159
01:27:35.331 --> 01:27:39.833
We're going to
run twins, left 48 sweep.


1160
01:27:39.835 --> 01:27:41.201
- Kyle.
- Yes, sir.


1161
01:27:41.203 --> 01:27:42.669
Don't you take
all day about it.


1162
01:27:42.671 --> 01:27:44.838
You turn that corner
and bully your way


1163
01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.406
into that end zone.

1164
01:27:48.176 --> 01:27:51.144
Take a look at the
guys around you.


1165
01:27:51.146 --> 01:27:55.782
Make sure when you walk
off this field tonight,
you've given your best.


1166
01:27:55.784 --> 01:27:58.885
That you can hold
your head up high.


1167
01:28:01.823 --> 01:28:05.125
It's been an honor
to coach you boys.


1168
01:28:07.028 --> 01:28:08.995
Travis?

1169
01:28:08.997 --> 01:28:12.132
Redhound pride on three!

1170
01:28:12.134 --> 01:28:15.502
- One, two, three!
- Redhound Pride!


1171
01:28:15.504 --> 01:28:17.204
Go.

1172
01:28:19.208 --> 01:28:21.475
You got this, Trav.

1173
01:28:25.147 --> 01:28:27.714
All right, boys,
here we go.


1174
01:28:27.716 --> 01:28:29.182
Twins left.

1175
01:28:29.184 --> 01:28:32.419
No, check that,
let's run something else.


1176
01:28:32.421 --> 01:28:35.856
- Are you serious?
- Cameron, you're at center.
Kyle, you are at guard.


1177
01:28:35.858 --> 01:28:39.826
Travis, you're in
the backfield.


1178
01:28:39.828 --> 01:28:42.829
Wait, what? Jerry.

1179
01:28:42.831 --> 01:28:44.664
You're not screwing this up!
Run the damn play.


1180
01:28:44.666 --> 01:28:47.401
Hey, there is no damn
way in hell Kyle can score
in a sweep.


1181
01:28:47.403 --> 01:28:50.737
And you know that.
But Travis can run

1182
01:28:50.739 --> 01:28:53.607
- But the handoff, man.
- Don't worry about it,
I'll get you the ball.


1183
01:28:53.609 --> 01:28:58.945
All you gotta do is run
straight ahead. You can run
a straight line, can't you?


1184
01:29:01.115 --> 01:29:04.017
- Why are you doing this, man?
- 'Cause I'm the quarterback.


1185
01:29:04.019 --> 01:29:07.854
And you,
you're Travis Freeman.


1186
01:29:07.856 --> 01:29:09.856
Make a hole!

1187
01:29:09.858 --> 01:29:12.959
Hit that linebacker
like he's your old man.


1188
01:29:15.463 --> 01:29:18.198
- Let's do it, boys.
- Sweet.


1189
01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:20.700
- 23 Blast on 1. Ready?
- Break!


1190
01:29:22.704 --> 01:29:24.070
<i>Fasten your</i>
<i>seatbelts, folks,</i>

1192
01:29:26.975 --> 01:29:28.942
<i>It's a full house back field,</i>

- He's what?


1196
01:29:37.219 --> 01:29:40.821
- What the hell?!
- No, he didn't!


1197
01:29:40.823 --> 01:29:42.456
Yeah, he did.

1198
01:29:57.505 --> 01:29:58.472
Fingertips!

1199
01:30:10.852 --> 01:30:13.386
