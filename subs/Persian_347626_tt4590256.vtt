00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.405
Look, I gave her a compliment
for keeping her songs under two minutes.


153
00:07:00.488 --> 00:07:01.780
Oh my God. Seriously.

154
00:07:01.863 --> 00:07:03.071
[speaking indistinctly]

155
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.071
She acts like she doesn't even know me.

156
00:07:07.155 --> 00:07:09.696
That's just because
she's tremendously ashamed of you.


157
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.696
Huh.

158
00:07:11.988 --> 00:07:13.655
Hi, little sis!

159
00:07:13.738 --> 00:07:15.113
Did you get your Lunchables?

160
00:07:15.196 --> 00:07:17.363
Oh, don't forget
to take your laxatives too!


161
00:07:17.446 --> 00:07:20.488
-The doctor says you need to stay regular!
-[Brin] Shut up!


162
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:21.946
[laughing]

163
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.113
Oh my God.

164
00:07:23.738 --> 00:07:25.488
You're so evil, you know that?

165
00:07:25.571 --> 00:07:27.696
Um, did you talk to your parents
about our trip?


166
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.071
'Cause I was thinking,
what if we start in Portugal


167
00:07:30.155 --> 00:07:31.155
instead of Spain,

168
00:07:31.238 --> 00:07:32.946
and then we make our way up
north from there.


169
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.321
Well, wherever we do end up,

170
00:07:34.405 --> 00:07:36.863
as long as we get back
by August for my orientation.


171
00:07:36.946 --> 00:07:38.196
UC Riverside, really?

172
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.530
What? I think I'd do really well there
without having to work very hard.


173
00:07:41.613 --> 00:07:43.113
Plus, it's near Legoland.

174
00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:44.738
I effing love Legoland.

175
00:07:44.821 --> 00:07:46.863
Isn't UCSD the one near Legoland?

176
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.821
I think I made a huge mistake.

177
00:07:51.905 --> 00:07:55.738
This is so cool. I've never been
on the set of a music video before.


178
00:07:55.821 --> 00:07:58.863
[woman] Try working on one.
We're an hour behind, wardrobe just quit,


179
00:07:58.946 --> 00:08:01.738
and I am 90%
sure I'm getting pink eye.

180
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:04.446
-Ew.
-Jordan's trailer's this big one here.


181
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.446
Make it fast.
We're calling him to set soon.


182
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.155
Okay, we'll do it live.

183
00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:10.655
When I cue you,
press this and follow me inside.


184
00:08:10.738 --> 00:08:12.280
Yep, I know how to work a phone.

185
00:08:12.363 --> 00:08:13.946
-Thanks.
-And action.


186
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.321
Okay, guys. We're live here, and surprise!

187
00:08:16.405 --> 00:08:18.155
We're on the set
of Jordan's brand-new video


188
00:08:18.238 --> 00:08:19.946
in beautiful Hollywood, California.

189
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.863
-[coughs] Canoga Park.
-Same thing.


190
00:08:21.946 --> 00:08:24.488
[giggles] I can't wait to see his face.

191
00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:26.280
-[knocking]
-Hello?


192
00:08:26.363 --> 00:08:28.613
-[music playing]
-Wow. He's really blasting that music.


193
00:08:28.696 --> 00:08:30.655
Is he listening to himself?

194
00:08:30.738 --> 00:08:31.655
Yeah. So?

195
00:08:31.738 --> 00:08:32.571
Come on.

196
00:08:32.655 --> 00:08:33.655
[trailer door opens]

197
00:08:33.738 --> 00:08:36.196
-[Padgett] Jordan?
-[music playing loudly]


198
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.363
-Jordan!
-Padgett?


199
00:08:37.446 --> 00:08:39.155
-[girl] Padgett!
-What are you doing?


200
00:08:39.238 --> 00:08:40.738
What do you think they're doing?

201
00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:44.696
-Okay, let's not freak out here. Okay?
-Oh my God. I'm so, so sorry.


202
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.405
I have no idea how this happened.

203
00:08:47.488 --> 00:08:50.155
Padgett, I'm such a big fan.

204
00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:51.488
I'm Aniston, by the way.

205
00:08:51.571 --> 00:08:52.988
Your name is Aniston?

206
00:08:53.071 --> 00:08:54.363
It's a family name.

207
00:08:54.821 --> 00:08:56.405
Well, you've made them very proud.

208
00:08:56.488 --> 00:08:57.738
-Thank you.
-[Padgett] Ugh!


209
00:08:57.821 --> 00:08:59.071
-You scumbag!
-Padge.


210
00:08:59.155 --> 00:09:00.988
I made you croquembouche!

211
00:09:01.071 --> 00:09:02.030
[Jordan] Okay.

212
00:09:02.113 --> 00:09:03.655
I even made them with almond flour

213
00:09:03.738 --> 00:09:05.655
so you wouldn't fart
during your precious video!


214
00:09:05.738 --> 00:09:07.946
-Check this out.
-[Padgett] I can't believe you!


215
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.030
Is this why you told me
not to visit the set?


216
00:09:10.113 --> 00:09:12.321
So you could hook up
with the backup dancer?


217
00:09:12.405 --> 00:09:13.780
-[Jordan] No!
-[grunting furiously]


218
00:09:13.863 --> 00:09:15.321
Oh my God! [laughing]

219
00:09:15.405 --> 00:09:17.530
I think I just saw
Jordan Van Draanen's thing.


220
00:09:17.613 --> 00:09:20.738
-[Padgett] Aniston is not a first name!
-Not too shabby, JVD.


221
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:22.238
[Padgett grunts] I hate you!

222
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:24.446
-After everything we've been through?
-[Jordan] Padgett!


223
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:25.738
We're over, okay?

224
00:09:25.821 --> 00:09:29.613
Know what? You don't deserve me, my love,
and you don't deserve my croquembouche.


225
00:09:29.696 --> 00:09:31.488
-You croquem-douche!
-[girl 2] Padgett!


226
00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:32.905
What?! [gasps]

227
00:09:34.196 --> 00:09:35.405
You're still live.

228
00:09:35.905 --> 00:09:36.821
[exhales heavily]

229
00:09:36.905 --> 00:09:37.863
[bangs]

230
00:09:37.946 --> 00:09:39.946
[fading low whir]

231
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.238
[phone ringing]

232
00:09:42.238 --> 00:09:44.071
-[Padgett grunts]
-[knocking on door]


233
00:09:44.155 --> 00:09:47.696
Padgett, you feeling okay?
Missing school today?


234
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.196
[Padgett groans] Mom, I'm fine.

235
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.863
I just wanna be alone.

236
00:09:51.946 --> 00:09:55.780
I went through all the trouble
of putting cereal in a bowl with milk.


237
00:09:55.863 --> 00:09:57.113
[Padgett] Lucky Charms? Mom--

238
00:09:57.196 --> 00:09:59.905
I know it's not really
what you eat anymore,


239
00:09:59.988 --> 00:10:02.071
but it cheered you
up when you were eight.

240
00:10:02.155 --> 00:10:04.196
Look, I'm just not hungry, okay?

241
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.238
Suit yourself. [spoon taps]

242
00:10:06.321 --> 00:10:07.321
[crunching]

243
00:10:07.405 --> 00:10:09.488
Hmm! Wow. The marshmallows.

244
00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:11.821
-I forgot about the marshmallows.
-Mom.


245
00:10:11.905 --> 00:10:14.446
Give me a break.
I've been eating Mueslix for ten years.


246
00:10:15.238 --> 00:10:16.071
Look, honey,

247
00:10:16.155 --> 00:10:20.405
I do know that breakups are hard,
especially your first.


248
00:10:20.488 --> 00:10:22.113
It's not just the breakup.

249
00:10:22.196 --> 00:10:23.321
I was humiliated.

250
00:10:23.405 --> 00:10:26.571
I know that it feels
like the absolute end of the world now,


251
00:10:26.655 --> 00:10:29.738
but I can promise you
with absolute certainty


252
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:31.071
that it will get better.

253
00:10:31.155 --> 00:10:31.988
Well, when?

254
00:10:33.238 --> 00:10:34.196
Three months.

255
00:10:34.946 --> 00:10:37.488
Maybe a year. Five tops.

256
00:10:37.571 --> 00:10:40.530
Even if it's just you and me
for the rest of our lives,


257
00:10:40.613 --> 00:10:41.446
what do we do?

258
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.905
We get a couple of twin beds,
fierce matching jumpsuits,


259
00:10:44.988 --> 00:10:46.280
a couple dozen more cats.

260
00:10:46.363 --> 00:10:47.738
It would be great.

261
00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:48.738
[phone ringing]

262
00:10:49.321 --> 00:10:50.988
-Think about it.
-[Padgett sighs]


263
00:10:52.238 --> 00:10:54.488
-Hey.
-There you are. I was so worried.


264
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:57.571
-We missed you at dance practice.
-Sorry, I saw you called.


265
00:10:57.655 --> 00:11:01.155
-I've kinda just been--
-Avoiding life? Can't say I blame you.


266
00:11:01.238 --> 00:11:02.946
Why did I have to go live?

267
00:11:03.446 --> 00:11:05.571
And why did Alden keep recording?

268
00:11:05.655 --> 00:11:08.530
Because you always go live,
and Alden must have been in shock.


269
00:11:08.613 --> 00:11:11.946
Yeah, well, at least everyone got to see
what an asshole Jordan is.


270
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.738
Yeah, I guess.

271
00:11:13.821 --> 00:11:15.196
You guess?

272
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.655
No! I mean, yes. 
You're totally right.

273
00:11:17.738 --> 00:11:19.696
-Yes.
-Q, what's going on?


274
00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.738
Nothing.

275
00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:24.363
It's just,
I guess you haven't looked online today?


276
00:11:27.196 --> 00:11:28.571
[phone pinging]

277
00:11:31.405 --> 00:11:33.655
[breathing heavily]

278
00:11:33.738 --> 00:11:35.905
[Quinn] Padgett? Hello?
Are you still there?


279
00:11:35.988 --> 00:11:38.821
I think I'm gonna be sick.
How could this happen?


280
00:11:38.905 --> 00:11:40.738
[Quinn] A few people are being
kind of mean.


281
00:11:40.821 --> 00:11:41.655
A few?

282
00:11:41.738 --> 00:11:43.655
[phone pinging]

283
00:11:43.738 --> 00:11:44.696
Bubble Girl?

284
00:11:45.613 --> 00:11:46.780
Who's Bubble Girl?

285
00:11:46.863 --> 00:11:48.655
[clears throat] You are?

286
00:11:48.738 --> 00:11:50.071
How am I Bubble--

287
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.196
Oh my God.

288
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.988
Padgett, listen to me, okay?
Everything's going to be just fine.


289
00:11:58.071 --> 00:11:59.821
How could you say that? I'm a joke.

290
00:11:59.905 --> 00:12:03.530
I'm a punchline with a disgusting
mucus-themed nickname. I'm--


291
00:12:03.613 --> 00:12:04.946
[phone vibrates]

292
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.363
-Oh no.
-[Quinn] Who is it?


293
00:12:06.446 --> 00:12:09.071
It's Jessica Miles Torres
from Bunny Venom.


294
00:12:11.155 --> 00:12:12.863
Jessica, hi. What's up?

295
00:12:12.946 --> 00:12:15.530
You're going viral in the wrong way.

296
00:12:15.613 --> 00:12:19.905
Okay, so you saw the video,
and while it is unfortunate…


297
00:12:19.988 --> 00:12:23.280
Unfortunate? My ex-husband's
hiking accident was unfortunate,


298
00:12:23.363 --> 00:12:24.696
and he was mauled by bears.

299
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.488
Oh my God. Is… is he okay?

300
00:12:26.571 --> 00:12:28.030
Better than you.

301
00:12:28.113 --> 00:12:30.446
But, honey, I get it. 
I can sympathize.

302
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.280
You were betrayed, mistreated, humiliated.

303
00:12:33.363 --> 00:12:34.655
So you do understand?

304
00:12:34.738 --> 00:12:38.863
Of course. The difference is
you completely lost it in front of, like…


305
00:12:38.946 --> 00:12:41.113
A lot of people. I know.

306
00:12:41.196 --> 00:12:45.613
[Jessica]

00:19:12.696 --> 00:19:14.405
I'm sorry. Yes, please finish.

459
00:19:14.488 --> 00:19:17.280
-We need someone to take pictures for--
-No.


460
00:19:18.071 --> 00:19:19.780
-But it's a fundraiser.
-For what?


461
00:19:19.863 --> 00:19:22.155
Is it cancer research or homelessness?

462
00:19:22.238 --> 00:19:24.030
-Actually, the prom.
-Okay. [laughs]


463
00:19:24.113 --> 00:19:26.988
[giggles nervously] Is that funny?

464
00:19:27.071 --> 00:19:30.905
No, it's sad, actually,
but, um, good luck with that.


465
00:19:31.905 --> 00:19:32.738
Oh my--

466
00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:36.488
I'm so sorry about him.
He's literally like that with everybody.


467
00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:39.613
-How do you know him?
-He's my brother. Just by blood though.


468
00:19:39.696 --> 00:19:41.863
If you don't mind,
I'd rather not publicize it.


469
00:19:41.946 --> 00:19:43.530
Sorry, I don't think I know--

470
00:19:43.613 --> 00:19:45.613
Oh, um, Brin Kweller, sophomore.

471
00:19:45.696 --> 00:19:48.571
I just have to say,
I think you're amazing.


472
00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:52.113
I mean, it sucks what happened
to you. Jordan is such a dick.


473
00:19:52.196 --> 00:19:53.988
Unless you're getting back
together with him?


474
00:19:54.071 --> 00:19:56.113
-No. It's fine.
-Because in that case…


475
00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:58.196
He is a dick.

476
00:19:58.946 --> 00:20:00.446
Is your brother one too?

477
00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.613
[scoffs] Um, no, not a dick,

478
00:20:03.696 --> 00:20:06.821
but he does tend
to be a bit misanthropic?

479
00:20:07.321 --> 00:20:08.238
I sensed that.

480
00:20:09.071 --> 00:20:12.488
Uh, so if he doesn't like people,
what does he like?


481
00:20:12.571 --> 00:20:14.196
Oh, huh, let's see.

482
00:20:14.905 --> 00:20:16.946
Photography, allegedly.

483
00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:17.863
Allegedly?

484
00:20:18.363 --> 00:20:20.863
No one ever gets to see
any of his pictures, so…


485
00:20:20.946 --> 00:20:22.613
What about music?

486
00:20:23.113 --> 00:20:25.655
Only weird, old stuff,
no one else listens to,


487
00:20:25.738 --> 00:20:28.655
like the Bad Brains, Bad Religion.

488
00:20:28.738 --> 00:20:30.696
Really just anything
with "bad" in the name.


489
00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.738
Wow. Uh, what about movies?

490
00:20:32.821 --> 00:20:33.821
Same thing.

491
00:20:33.905 --> 00:20:37.155
Everything's Kurosawa,
kung fu, or Kubrick.


492
00:20:37.238 --> 00:20:39.405
Oh, my. That is a lot of K's.

493
00:20:39.988 --> 00:20:44.321
So, um, [clicks lips] why are you suddenly
so interested in my brother?


494
00:20:44.905 --> 00:20:48.738
Don't get me wrong, I love him
and all, but that's just 'cause I have to.


495
00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:51.613
Uh, curiosity, I guess?

496
00:20:51.696 --> 00:20:52.696
Horses.

497
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.863
-I'm sorry?
-He loves horses.


498
00:20:54.946 --> 00:20:58.030
He works every day
before school at Will Rogers Park.


499
00:20:58.113 --> 00:20:59.655
So like a cowboy, huh?

500
00:20:59.738 --> 00:21:01.405
No, more like a horse girl.

501
00:21:01.488 --> 00:21:04.488
He kind of cried
when he found out unicorns weren't real.


502
00:21:07.071 --> 00:21:09.946
Cameron. What a weird coincidence.

503
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.280
Uh, well, I'm here every morning, so…

504
00:21:13.363 --> 00:21:15.530
I'm pretty sure
the only weird part is you.


505
00:21:15.613 --> 00:21:16.488
Fair enough.

506
00:21:16.571 --> 00:21:19.113
I was hoping to take
a riding lesson this morning.


507
00:21:19.196 --> 00:21:20.863
And I figured
since you and I are friends--


508
00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:24.113
-Ah, friends?
-In the sense we go to school together.


509
00:21:24.196 --> 00:21:26.696
Kind of a loose definition.
Don't you think?


510
00:21:27.363 --> 00:21:30.196
Uh, look, I have a lot of work
to get done before school--


511
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.071
So let me help!
Then if there's time afterwards,


512
00:21:33.155 --> 00:21:34.821
we can squeeze in a lesson.

513
00:21:34.905 --> 00:21:38.530
-You don't even know what the job is.
-That's okay. I am at your service.


514
00:21:39.321 --> 00:21:42.238
Ugh! There's just so much of it. [gags]

515
00:21:42.321 --> 00:21:44.280
What do horses eat anyway?

516
00:21:44.363 --> 00:21:48.030
[Cameron] Well, that one,
Jimbo over there, he likes Chipotle.


517
00:21:48.113 --> 00:21:49.530
Gilly prefers sushi.

518
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.780
Just horse feed. 
Hay, grass mostly.

519
00:21:53.863 --> 00:21:57.113
Well, this one must have eaten
an entire soccer field.


520
00:21:57.196 --> 00:21:58.696
Well, you offered to help.

521
00:21:59.405 --> 00:22:02.280
I'm starting to think
you've never shoveled crap before.


522
00:22:02.363 --> 00:22:03.863
Only out of a litter box.

523
00:22:04.613 --> 00:22:06.738
And this dump is bigger than my cat.

524
00:22:06.821 --> 00:22:07.863
[chuckles]

525
00:22:07.946 --> 00:22:10.571
So, you really come here
every day before school?


526
00:22:10.655 --> 00:22:12.571
Yep, ever since I was 14.

527
00:22:12.655 --> 00:22:13.780
[shutter clicking]

528
00:22:13.863 --> 00:22:17.530
Wow, you really want to chronicle
your post-poop clean-up look?


529
00:22:17.613 --> 00:22:20.113
I chronicle everything. 
That's my job.

530
00:22:20.696 --> 00:22:23.113
So, how about that lesson now?

531
00:22:24.821 --> 00:22:27.030
I guess a deal's a deal.

532
00:22:27.946 --> 00:22:30.780
So, do you have
any previous riding experience?


533
00:22:30.863 --> 00:22:33.113
Just one time at a birthday party
when I was five,


534
00:22:33.196 --> 00:22:35.696
but I think it was a baby horse,

535
00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.946
or maybe not baby,
but it was small. [chuckles nervously]


536
00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.155
Does that count?

537
00:22:40.238 --> 00:22:44.196
I believe the word
you're looking for is pony and no.


538
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.155
[inhales] Anyway, this is Gilly.
He can be a little temperamental, so I--


539
00:22:48.238 --> 00:22:50.655
-What are you doing?
-I'm letting him smell my hand.


540
00:22:50.738 --> 00:22:54.821
It's like a handshake for horses.
I did my research last night. [chuckles]


541
00:22:54.905 --> 00:22:57.780
-[soft neighing]
-Whoa. Why is he doing that?


542
00:22:57.863 --> 00:22:59.530
Actually means he likes you.

543
00:22:59.613 --> 00:23:02.196
Oh, well, I guess he has good instincts.

544
00:23:02.988 --> 00:23:03.821
Right.

545
00:23:03.905 --> 00:23:06.321
Let's, um, try mounting up.
So come over here.


546
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:10.071
Put your left foot in the stirrup,
grab the reins with your left hand,


547
00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:12.780
and use your other leg
to haul you up and over.


548
00:23:12.863 --> 00:23:14.071
[Padgett grunts]

549
00:23:15.238 --> 00:23:17.571
-I'm a natural, right?
-Not bad.


550
00:23:19.238 --> 00:23:20.155
[shutter clicking]

551
00:23:20.238 --> 00:23:22.196
[Cameron] Um, seriously?

552
00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.863
-More?
-I'm just capturing the moment. [chuckles]


553
00:23:24.946 --> 00:23:27.946
You can't enjoy this without sharing it
with 500 strangers?


554
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:31.238
Five hundred? Try 887,132.

555
00:23:31.321 --> 00:23:33.655
And they're not strangers.
They're followers.


556
00:23:33.738 --> 00:23:35.696
Followers? You mean like a cult?

557
00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.363
No, not like a cult.

558
00:23:37.446 --> 00:23:40.280
Just people devoted to me
and totally guided by my advice


559
00:23:40.363 --> 00:23:42.071
as to how to live their lives.

560
00:23:42.155 --> 00:23:44.655
I'm joking. I was just taking a picture.

561
00:23:44.738 --> 00:23:48.196
-You take pictures. What's the difference?
-Too vast to even explain.


562
00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.988
Now, come on off the horse.

563
00:23:50.071 --> 00:23:51.488
-That's it? We're done?
-No.


564
00:23:51.571 --> 00:23:53.530
I just want you
to practice getting on and off.


565
00:23:53.613 --> 00:23:55.321
Oh, uh, okay.

566
00:23:55.405 --> 00:23:56.238
Uh…

567
00:23:56.905 --> 00:23:58.696
-Whoa!
-Whoa. Hold on. Hold on.


568
00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.530
[Padgett grunts] Oh!

569
00:24:01.238 --> 00:24:02.071
[grunts]

570
00:24:02.155 --> 00:24:03.696
-[Cameron groans]
-Ugh…


571
00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.655
-Disgusting!
-[laughs hysterically] Sorry!


572
00:24:06.738 --> 00:24:07.613
Sorry for laughing.

573
00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:10.238
It's just I've never seen
such an uncoordinated dismount.


574
00:24:10.321 --> 00:24:12.946
I mean,
aren't you captain of the dance team--


575
00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:14.113
[laughing out loud]

576
00:24:15.155 --> 00:24:17.363
What? It's mostly grass, right?

577
00:24:17.446 --> 00:24:19.905
[laughing out loud]

578
00:24:19.988 --> 00:24:22.655
[Bosch] Attention Earthquakes,
a reminder to buy your prom tickets,


579
00:24:22.738 --> 00:24:26.071
where the dance team will be performing
their annual dance presentation.


580
00:24:26.155 --> 00:24:29.405
A tradition I still don't understand,
but it's the committee's decision,


581
00:24:29.488 --> 00:24:30.613
and I support them.

582
00:24:30.696 --> 00:24:33.196
…instead of starting in Portugal,
we start in Amsterdam.


583
00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.946
Uh, Kweller, can we maybe do this later?
I have a French quiz.


584
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.030
These are the best fares
I've seen in months.


585
00:24:38.113 --> 00:24:39.946
Just, um, give me your phone.

586
00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:41.988
-What's wrong with yours?
-Really?


587
00:24:42.905 --> 00:24:45.780
Your aversion to technology
is becoming a character flaw.


588
00:24:45.863 --> 00:24:46.696
Hey, guys.

589
00:24:47.196 --> 00:24:49.738
Uh… hey?

590
00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:51.738
I wanted to say thank you
for this morning.


591
00:24:51.821 --> 00:24:54.446
My butt is so sore. 
I could barely walk.

592
00:24:55.071 --> 00:24:56.071
Things got messy.

593
00:24:56.155 --> 00:24:58.071
Uh, context, please?

594
00:24:58.155 --> 00:25:00.363
-I gave her a riding lesson.
-I bet you did.


595
00:25:00.446 --> 00:25:02.113
Horse riding.

596
00:25:02.196 --> 00:25:03.655
-Mm-hmm.
-Part of one, anyway.


597
00:25:03.738 --> 00:25:07.405
And as a way of saying thanks,
there is a karaoke party this Saturday


598
00:25:07.488 --> 00:25:11.113
at my friend Quinn's house,
and I was hoping you guys could come.


599
00:25:11.196 --> 00:25:13.988
-Uh, yeah. Um, I don't… I don't--
-We'll be there.


600
00:25:14.071 --> 00:25:18.321
Perfect. So Cameron,
should I like, SMS you the address?


601
00:25:18.405 --> 00:25:20.321
Kweller's phone is
an antiquated piece of crap.


602
00:25:20.405 --> 00:25:22.821
-Why don't you send it to me?
-Awesome. Okay.


603
00:25:22.905 --> 00:25:25.488
-Okay, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
-[Nisha] Totally.


604
00:25:26.655 --> 00:25:27.488
What the hell?

605
00:25:27.571 --> 00:25:30.905
You've been talking about wanting
to go on all these exotic adventures.


606
00:25:30.988 --> 00:25:34.696
Why don't you just think of this
as an adventure close to home.


607
00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.363
[exhilarating music playing]

608
00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.280

00:32:00.113 --> 00:32:02.321
Uh, yeah, sure. 
When do you wanna come?

761
00:32:02.405 --> 00:32:03.696
[doorbell rings]

762
00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.363
Oh, like now, now.

763
00:32:05.446 --> 00:32:07.155
Okay. Yeah, hold on.

764
00:32:07.863 --> 00:32:08.988
You might wanna change.

765
00:32:09.821 --> 00:32:11.738
-[phone rings]
-[gasps softly]


766
00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.196
-Jessica. Hi.
-[Jessica] Hey, Padgett.


767
00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.405
Saw the duet. 2.6 million views!

768
00:32:18.488 --> 00:32:21.155
Who's the new guy?
A little scruffy but cute.


769
00:32:21.238 --> 00:32:24.196
Well, just wait until I'm done
with his makeover.


770
00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.446
Ooh, go on.

771
00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:28.280
I'm gonna make him more popular
than Jordan Van Draanen.


772
00:32:28.363 --> 00:32:31.238
[Jessica] Really? Well, if you do that,
then we're back in business.


773
00:32:31.321 --> 00:32:33.363
I'll believe it when I see it. Love ya.

774
00:32:33.446 --> 00:32:34.988
-[line disconnects]
-Love ya!


775
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:40.280
Thanks again. These things
are always slipping out of my bag.


776
00:32:40.363 --> 00:32:41.696
Yeah, it's no problem.

777
00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.946
Since I'm already here,
I was wondering if--


778
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:46.905
-What's all this stuff?
-Uh, it's from Dad. Just got here.


779
00:32:46.988 --> 00:32:48.530
Uh, great.

780
00:32:48.613 --> 00:32:51.488
-Gifts? What's the occasion?
-Nothing. It's stupid.


781
00:32:51.571 --> 00:32:55.530
Our dad lives in Sweden, and once a year,
he sends us these all-in-one presents.


782
00:32:55.613 --> 00:32:59.071
Kind of like Christmas and Hanukkah
and our birthdays all smushed together.


783
00:32:59.155 --> 00:33:00.321
[Cameron] Seriously?

784
00:33:00.405 --> 00:33:01.405
A doorstop?

785
00:33:01.488 --> 00:33:06.863
Hmm, coloring books, Legos,
and Swedish Helga Barbie.


786
00:33:06.946 --> 00:33:08.988
Quite a haul if you're eight.

787
00:33:09.071 --> 00:33:11.071
-At least he's trying.
-I disagree.


788
00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:13.696
Well, it's the thought that counts, right?

789
00:33:14.738 --> 00:33:18.113
-Not that it's my business.
-Um, did you need something else?


790
00:33:18.196 --> 00:33:21.321
Actually, yeah. I was hoping
you could give me another riding lesson.


791
00:33:22.071 --> 00:33:23.280
-When?
-Now?


792
00:33:23.363 --> 00:33:24.446
Now?

793
00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:27.738
Um, yeah. You're in luck.
I was on my way to the--


794
00:33:27.821 --> 00:33:31.238
Hey, I thought you were gonna watch
the Blue Bloods marathon with me.


795
00:33:31.321 --> 00:33:34.655
-Sorry, Grandma. Um, I--
-That's okay. I'll get started without ya.


796
00:33:34.738 --> 00:33:38.155
-[indistinct chatter on TV]
-Tommy Selleck waits for no one.


797
00:33:38.238 --> 00:33:39.238
[Grandma growls]

798
00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:40.530
We better go. [chuckles]

799
00:33:41.321 --> 00:33:42.780
Bye, guys.

800
00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:46.155
-[horse snorts]
-I'm getting the hang of this, huh?


801
00:33:46.238 --> 00:33:47.113
[both chuckle]

802
00:33:47.196 --> 00:33:49.155
[Cameron] Just takes
time and practice, that's all.


803
00:33:49.238 --> 00:33:51.155
Everyone's always in a hurry.

804
00:33:51.863 --> 00:33:54.655
-Oh, and you aren't?
-What's that supposed to mean?


805
00:33:55.196 --> 00:33:58.030
I don't know. It seems like you can't wait
to be done with high school.


806
00:33:58.613 --> 00:34:00.196
Yeah, that's true. [chuckles]

807
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:04.446
I used to be like that too,
but now that I lost my sponsorship,


808
00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:07.655
I, um, don't even know
if I'll be able to pay for college.


809
00:34:07.738 --> 00:34:09.113
Man, that sucks.

810
00:34:09.196 --> 00:34:12.030
I'm sorry, but it won't take much money
for me to bum around.


811
00:34:12.113 --> 00:34:16.030
See as much of the world as I can.
Take as many pictures as I can.


812
00:34:16.113 --> 00:34:18.155
That actually sounds amazing.

813
00:34:18.238 --> 00:34:20.071
I would love to travel someday.

814
00:34:20.155 --> 00:34:21.905
I always wanted to see Paris.

815
00:34:21.988 --> 00:34:24.155
You mean, you wanna
take pictures of yourself in Paris


816
00:34:24.238 --> 00:34:25.988
so your followers know you went there?

817
00:34:26.071 --> 00:34:29.363
Should I just do what you do
and take rolls and rolls of pictures


818
00:34:29.446 --> 00:34:30.446
and never show anyone?

819
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.113
-Wait.
-[horse snorting]


820
00:34:32.196 --> 00:34:33.863
-How do you know--
-Brin told me.


821
00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:37.696
You know, no one would have
ever heard of Diane Arbus or Ansel Adams


822
00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.571
if they hid in
their dark room all day.

823
00:34:39.655 --> 00:34:40.821
-Huh.
-[horse snorts]


824
00:34:40.905 --> 00:34:41.821
[giggles] What?

825
00:34:42.321 --> 00:34:44.571
I can't believe
you actually know those names.


826
00:34:44.655 --> 00:34:46.863
So, how about it?

827
00:34:46.946 --> 00:34:48.780
-How about what?
-Your pictures.


828
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.363
-When do I get to see them?
-Uh, I'm thinking never.


829
00:34:52.446 --> 00:34:56.030
Oh, come on. You show me yours,
and I'll show you mine.


830
00:34:56.113 --> 00:34:57.613
Oh, everyone has seen yours.

831
00:34:57.696 --> 00:34:58.655
[chuckles]

832
00:34:58.738 --> 00:35:01.696
Sorry, that came out way dirtier
than I intended it to.


833
00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:02.988
[laughing]

834
00:35:03.071 --> 00:35:05.113
Uh, I'm just really private, that's all.

835
00:35:05.196 --> 00:35:07.821
But, um…
if you really wanna see what I do…


836
00:35:07.905 --> 00:35:08.738
Yes.

837
00:35:09.405 --> 00:35:10.238
Okay.

838
00:35:11.571 --> 00:35:13.780
So you've really never been
to Union Station?


839
00:35:14.321 --> 00:35:16.571
Honestly, I didn't even know
this was here.


840
00:35:16.655 --> 00:35:17.780
Is that terrible?

841
00:35:17.863 --> 00:35:20.446
Uh, yeah, kind of. [laughs]

842
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:23.571
It's like a classic,
old-timey train station.


843
00:35:23.655 --> 00:35:26.488
Well, it's actually
a working train station


844
00:35:26.571 --> 00:35:28.113
where people take trains.

845
00:35:28.196 --> 00:35:29.571
-[chuckles softly]
-[laughs]


846
00:35:30.988 --> 00:35:32.321
[shutter clicks]

847
00:35:32.738 --> 00:35:35.988
Then again, you don't strike me
as the public-transportation type.


848
00:35:36.071 --> 00:35:37.446
I carpool to school.

849
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:39.030
In your friend's Lexus.

850
00:35:40.238 --> 00:35:41.196
Hey, Mr. Cahill.

851
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.363
-Hey, Cam.
-This place is amazing.


852
00:35:43.946 --> 00:35:46.696
I guess I never come downtown
because it's always so crowded.


853
00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:50.155
With street photography, crowds are
the point. Makes it easier to blend in.


854
00:35:50.238 --> 00:35:52.405
People don't mind you
just taking their picture?


855
00:35:52.488 --> 00:35:53.821
Uh, well, it depends.

856
00:35:53.905 --> 00:35:55.905
Sometimes I ask permission,
sometimes I don't.


857
00:35:55.988 --> 00:35:59.696
But after a while, you kind of develop
a sense of when it's okay to shoot.


858
00:36:00.655 --> 00:36:01.905
[shutter clicking]

859
00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.405
[speaking Japanese]

860
00:36:04.488 --> 00:36:05.946
-And when to run.
-[chuckles]


861
00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.696
-Thanks, Gene. Here you go.
-Mm.


862
00:36:10.196 --> 00:36:12.780
Gene's Nutella lattes are insane.

863
00:36:14.821 --> 00:36:17.196
-Mm-hmm. [chuckles]
-[Padgett] Mm.


864
00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.571
Wait, are you actually smiling?

865
00:36:20.155 --> 00:36:21.238
What?

866
00:36:21.321 --> 00:36:23.738
I don't know.
I've just never seen you like this.


867
00:36:23.821 --> 00:36:24.946
What do you mean?

868
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:31.238
Well, at school,
you're this really reserved person,


869
00:36:31.321 --> 00:36:34.988
but at the stables
or here with your camera…


870
00:36:35.071 --> 00:36:37.113
Oh, maybe it's because

871
00:36:37.196 --> 00:36:39.696
no one in those places
ever keyed the word "loser"


872
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.863
into my truck door
or put a fetal pig in my backpack.


873
00:36:43.363 --> 00:36:44.363
Ouch.

874
00:36:44.446 --> 00:36:45.530
Yeah.

875
00:36:45.613 --> 00:36:46.905
It doesn't matter.

876
00:36:46.988 --> 00:36:50.488
High school's a bunch of scared people
pretending to be something they're not.


877
00:36:50.571 --> 00:36:53.196
[chuckles] But this place?

878
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.655
This place is real.

879
00:36:55.655 --> 00:36:56.738
Just like horses.

880
00:36:56.821 --> 00:36:59.655
Best bullshit detectors
in the entire animal kingdom.


881
00:36:59.738 --> 00:37:01.238
So what about Gilly?

882
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:05.446
-Does he think I'm full of crap?
-You think I'd be here with you if he did?


883
00:37:07.738 --> 00:37:10.238
Sorry things are so
bad for you at school.

884
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:12.946
Guess I'd be in
a hurry to graduate too.

885
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:16.030
Yeah, I'm only doing it
so my grandmother doesn't freak out.


886
00:37:16.113 --> 00:37:18.488
Yeah, why do you
and Brin live with her?

887
00:37:18.571 --> 00:37:20.071
Sorry, if that's…

888
00:37:20.155 --> 00:37:21.613
No, no, no. No, it's okay.

889
00:37:21.696 --> 00:37:24.613
Well, you know our father lives in Sweden.

890
00:37:24.696 --> 00:37:26.238
-His choice.
-[Padgett] Mm-hmm.


891
00:37:26.321 --> 00:37:28.363
And after our mom died and…

892
00:37:28.446 --> 00:37:31.280
Oh, I am so sorry.

893
00:37:31.363 --> 00:37:34.196
[Cameron] Yeah, it's four years ago.
Plane crash.


894
00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:38.446
She was dating this guy named Marcus,
who flew a turboprop.


895
00:37:39.321 --> 00:37:43.238
And one Saturday morning,
they were on their way back from Laramie,


896
00:37:44.738 --> 00:37:46.280
and, um…

897
00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.280
You must miss her a lot.

898
00:37:49.446 --> 00:37:50.905
Yeah, Mom was awesome.

899
00:37:52.738 --> 00:37:55.988
In fact, she is the one
who gave me this camera.


900
00:37:56.071 --> 00:37:58.071
So that's why you love it so much.

901
00:37:58.155 --> 00:38:00.571
Yeah. So what about your family?

902
00:38:00.655 --> 00:38:02.821
Well, my parents are divorced.

903
00:38:02.905 --> 00:38:04.238
-[chuckles]
-Okay.


904
00:38:04.321 --> 00:38:08.446
Um, my dad lives in Florida
with his new family.


905
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:10.530
And I'm here with my mom.

906
00:38:10.613 --> 00:38:14.155
-Okay, what does she do?
-She's a nurse.


907
00:38:14.238 --> 00:38:15.155
Hmm.

908
00:38:15.238 --> 00:38:16.988
[Padgett]
I've never told anyone that before.


909
00:38:17.071 --> 00:38:20.988
She works her ass off
to give me every opportunity in the world.


910
00:38:21.488 --> 00:38:25.238
And sometimes I'm scared
I won't be able to make it up to her.


911
00:38:25.321 --> 00:38:28.363

[Padgett] Don't tell me
you're actually having fun.


1065
00:45:32.905 --> 00:45:34.488
Why would you say that?

1066
00:45:34.571 --> 00:45:36.363
This party is ridiculous.

You're having fun.

[Cameron] Maybe a little.

1069
00:45:42.155 --> 00:45:43.196
[Nisha] Hey.

1070
00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.488
Nice costume.

1071
00:45:45.071 --> 00:45:47.571
[scoffs] Didn't think I'd see
another Jordan Baker.


1072
00:45:47.655 --> 00:45:49.821
Daisy is so overrated. [laughs]

1073
00:45:49.905 --> 00:45:50.905
Totally.

1074
00:45:51.405 --> 00:45:55.405
Wow. I look like
the before picture for you.


1075
00:45:55.488 --> 00:45:56.905
Stop. You look great.

1076
00:45:57.863 --> 00:45:59.905
You were at my karaoke party.

1077
00:45:59.988 --> 00:46:03.071
Right. I was the one
who didn't bring their swimsuit.


1078
00:46:03.155 --> 00:46:06.738
-Yeah. I'm sorry it turned weird.
-It's okay. Weird's totally my thing.

-[laughs]


1082
00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.488
Come on. I know where Alden keeps
her non-Pop-Rock-aholic drinks.


1083
00:46:15.571 --> 00:46:16.946
-Thank you.
-Let's go.


1084
00:46:18.155 --> 00:46:19.363
Hey, you.

1085
00:46:20.738 --> 00:46:22.905
Whoa, whoa.
You're not even gonna say, "Hey"?


1086
00:46:22.988 --> 00:46:23.863
Blow me.

1087
00:46:23.946 --> 00:46:25.530
You're Aniston's problem now.

1088
00:46:25.613 --> 00:46:28.655
You're still mad about that?
That was like, two weeks ago.


1089
00:46:29.613 --> 00:46:31.530
-Hey.
-Dude! What the hell?


1090
00:46:31.613 --> 00:46:33.321
I'm sorry.
I had something else to tell you.


1091
00:46:33.405 --> 00:46:34.780
-What?
-[Jordan] I don't know.


1092
00:46:34.863 --> 00:46:36.488
That… I'm sorry.

1093
00:46:37.071 --> 00:46:39.113
And that she was right.

1094
00:46:39.571 --> 00:46:40.696
-Who?
-[Jordan] Aniston.


1095
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.571
She said that I wasn't over you,

1096
00:46:43.655 --> 00:46:46.905
and… that's the truth.

1097
00:46:47.696 --> 00:46:49.280
We belong together, Padge.

1098
00:46:49.905 --> 00:46:52.863
Now, come on. These nominations
are on Monday, all right?


1099
00:46:52.946 --> 00:46:56.071
If we win prom king and queen,
our followers would go crazy.


1100
00:46:56.155 --> 00:46:57.113
I don't care!

1101
00:46:58.363 --> 00:47:01.821
Oh, and by the way,
there are no mean streets of Pali.


1102
00:47:01.905 --> 00:47:04.280
You live on the same block
as Gwyneth Paltrow.


1103
00:47:05.196 --> 00:47:09.696
Oh man! You spilled my watermelon.
It was the last one.


1104
00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.238
Now, all they have is mango.

1105
00:47:11.321 --> 00:47:14.071
I hate mango. It's a terrible flavor.

1106
00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:15.613
Hey.

1107
00:47:16.405 --> 00:47:17.863
Is everything okay?

1108
00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:22.530
Yeah. Yeah, I just, uh, spilled my drink.

1109
00:47:22.613 --> 00:47:26.071
But I was thinking about going
to get another one, though.


1110
00:47:27.196 --> 00:47:29.738
Any chance you want to come with me?

1111
00:47:30.738 --> 00:47:31.946
[giggles] Sure.

Okay, enough pictures for you.
No one's going to see them anyways.


1116
00:47:41.405 --> 00:47:43.071
I have a better idea. Come on.

1117
00:47:43.155 --> 00:47:45.280
Oh, photo booth? Seriously?

1118

-You're supposed to pose.
-Sorry.


1125
00:47:56.988 --> 00:48:01.155
I guess I'm just mesmerized
by watching you disfigure yourself.


1126
00:48:01.238 --> 00:48:02.738
So you're repulsed?

1127
00:48:02.821 --> 00:48:06.030
Totally, but it must be so hard
to make yourself look terrible


1128
00:48:06.113 --> 00:48:08.196
when you're naturally so, you know…

What?

1130
00:48:10.821 --> 00:48:11.655
Beautiful.

1131

[party DJ] All right, everyone,
let's gather by the big cake


1132
00:48:17.821 --> 00:48:19.863

-Hey, Brin, what's going on?


1138
00:48:30.946 --> 00:48:32.863
Why are you making a
big deal out of this?

1139
00:48:32.946 --> 00:48:34.821
-It was nothing.
-You call that nothing?

-What happened? What did he do?
-She's so overreacting.

-You, shut up.
-He asked me if I wanted a drink.


1142
00:48:39.613 --> 00:48:40.780
So I said, "Okay."

1143
00:48:40.863 --> 00:48:43.613
And then we went into this big room
with a pool table.


1144
00:48:43.696 --> 00:48:46.363
-And we were just kissing.
-See? No big deal.


1145
00:48:46.488 --> 00:48:49.821
But then he started going for more,
so I bonked him with a pool ball.


1146
00:48:49.905 --> 00:48:52.321
-Which hurt, by the way.
-Freaking piece of shit.

-Why'd you just take off your shirt?

00:49:04.905 --> 00:49:07.821

and for you to find out.

00:58:18.321 --> 00:58:20.321
Can you believe all this prom BS?

1369
00:58:20.405 --> 00:58:23.696
I know. Pretty cool, right?
I mean, what do you think?


1370
00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:27.071
Well, that's actually
what I wanted to talk to you about.


1371
00:58:27.155 --> 00:58:28.071
[bell rings]

1372
00:58:28.155 --> 00:58:30.155
Uh, but now I'm late for Art History.

1373
00:58:30.238 --> 00:58:34.113
Um, is there any chance
you could come over after school?


1374
00:58:34.196 --> 00:58:37.363
-There's something I wanted to show you.
-Um, sure.


1375
00:58:37.446 --> 00:58:38.571
-I'll be there.
-Cool.


1376
00:58:39.071 --> 00:58:40.071
Bye.

1377
00:58:43.113 --> 00:58:45.405
-[door closes]
-So this whole prom king thing,


1378
00:58:46.071 --> 00:58:48.071
I can't believe you're actually into it.

1379
00:58:48.155 --> 00:58:51.738
Well, I'm not really,
but I do hate Van Draanen.


1380
00:58:51.821 --> 00:58:55.238
Guys like him crap all over everyone
and somehow still end up on top.


1381
00:58:55.321 --> 00:58:57.780
Not this time.
Not if I have anything to do with it.


1382
00:58:57.863 --> 00:59:00.363
-That sounded confident.
-'Cause I am.


1383
00:59:00.446 --> 00:59:03.280
And after Alden's party,
you have some serious traction.


1384
00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:06.780
But you're gonna have to let
people see the real Cam Kweller.


1385
00:59:06.863 --> 00:59:10.155
Well, speaking of the real me,
right this way.


1386
00:59:16.613 --> 00:59:19.738
Wow. I cannot believe
you have your own darkroom.


1387
00:59:20.238 --> 00:59:21.071
Yeah.

1388
00:59:21.155 --> 00:59:23.363
It was my 14th birthday present.

1389
00:59:23.863 --> 00:59:26.613
So you've been taking pictures
your whole life then?


1390
00:59:26.696 --> 00:59:29.655
[Cameron] Kind of.
Used to be more of a hobby,


1391
00:59:29.738 --> 00:59:31.696
but now I don't know.

1392
00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:35.488
Sometimes I feel like
I could spend my entire life in this room.


1393
00:59:36.113 --> 00:59:38.905
Cameron, these are amazing.

1394
00:59:39.571 --> 00:59:42.446
So why are you
letting me see them now?

1395
00:59:42.946 --> 00:59:44.780
Well, you wouldn't stop asking,

1396
00:59:45.363 --> 00:59:48.280
so I figured this was
the only way to get you to stop.


1397
00:59:48.363 --> 00:59:51.738
Well, you are very talented.

1398
00:59:51.821 --> 00:59:53.238
I mean, look at this one. Oh!

1399
00:59:54.238 --> 00:59:55.613
Oh my God, I am so sorry.

1400
00:59:55.696 --> 00:59:56.530
It's, uh…

1401
00:59:57.488 --> 00:59:58.655
It's okay.

1402
00:59:59.238 --> 01:00:00.071
Really.

1403
01:00:00.738 --> 01:00:03.321
You know, you could
totally make money at this, right?


1404
01:00:03.405 --> 01:00:04.988
You know I don't care about money.

1405
01:00:05.071 --> 01:00:08.488
Or not,
but keeping your talent locked away.


1406
01:00:08.571 --> 01:00:10.071
What are you hiding from?

1407
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:13.196
You know,
I could ask you the same question.


1408
01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.655
What are you talking about?

1409
01:00:14.738 --> 01:00:18.530
Well, I'm talking about this.

1410
01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:23.696
And, uh… this.

1411
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:26.988
And these.

1412

Listen, Cameron,
there's something I need to tell you.


1420
01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:50.238
-And I need to tell you something too.
-Okay?


1421
01:00:51.196 --> 01:00:55.071
Well, you asked me
why I invited you here,

1422
01:00:55.738 --> 01:00:58.238
and I don't even let
my own grandmother in here.

-Really?
-Yeah.


1424

Which is why she probably thinks
I'm running a meth lab.

[both laughing]

1426
01:01:03.696 --> 01:01:05.571
So then why am I here?

1427
01:01:06.155 --> 01:01:07.613
Because I trust you.

1428
01:01:10.196 --> 01:01:11.363
[Padgett] Oh, okay.

1429
01:01:11.446 --> 01:01:13.738
-Well, I--
-[Cameron] Are you okay?


1430
01:01:14.488 --> 01:01:16.696
Totally, I just… I need to go.

1431
01:01:17.196 --> 01:01:20.280
-Besides, I've wasted enough of your time.
-I wouldn't put it that way.


1432
01:01:20.363 --> 01:01:23.613
No, that's not what I meant.
I just… I have somewhere to be.


1433
01:01:23.696 --> 01:01:25.946
-Um… Call you later?
-[Cameron] Yeah.


1434
01:01:26.696 --> 01:01:27.530
Sure.

1435
01:01:35.571 --> 01:01:36.821
Hey, you got a sec?

1436
01:01:37.405 --> 01:01:38.988
Uh, yeah. Why?

1437
01:01:39.071 --> 01:01:42.113
I just kind of wanted
your advice on something.


1438
01:01:42.696 --> 01:01:44.905
If it isn't the fountain of truth

1439

coming to get help
figuring out the world of bullshit.


1440
01:01:48.196 --> 01:01:49.030
Yeah, funny.

1441
01:01:49.905 --> 01:01:51.405
Here's the deal. Uh…

1442
01:01:51.946 --> 01:01:55.780
Things with Padgett may have gotten
a little more complicated than I thought.


1443
01:01:55.863 --> 01:01:59.363
Okay. Complicated good or complicated bad?

1444
01:01:59.905 --> 01:02:04.280
'Cause the other night at that party,
I was definitely sensing chemistry.


1445
01:02:04.363 --> 01:02:05.655
Oh, wait.

1446
01:02:05.738 --> 01:02:06.863
Did you guys hook up?

1447
01:02:06.946 --> 01:02:08.780
Oh my God, you did!

1448
01:02:08.863 --> 01:02:12.030
No, no, no. We didn't hook up, we…

1449
01:02:12.821 --> 01:02:14.030
we kissed.

1450
01:02:14.113 --> 01:02:18.280
[shrieks] I knew it! Oh my God.
This is huge. So did you ask her to prom?


1451
01:02:18.363 --> 01:02:21.238
It makes sense if you go together.
And if you're king and queen?


1452
01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:22.530
How amazing would that be?

1453
01:02:22.613 --> 01:02:24.821
It would be like
Cali's own royal love story.


1454
01:02:24.905 --> 01:02:27.321
-[chuckles] And you're the princess.
-Whoa, whoa.


1455
01:02:27.405 --> 01:02:29.196
Yes. I thought about asking her,

1456
01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.363
but after we kissed,
things just kind of got weird.


1457
01:02:33.446 --> 01:02:34.988
Of course they did. It's fine.

1458
01:02:35.071 --> 01:02:36.571
First kisses can be awkward.

1459
01:02:36.655 --> 01:02:39.030
First time having sex,
that can be even weirder.


1460
01:02:39.113 --> 01:02:40.863
So is the last time

1461
01:02:40.946 --> 01:02:43.821
'cause you never know
if it's gonna be your last.


1462
01:02:44.571 --> 01:02:45.655
Oh…

1463
01:02:45.738 --> 01:02:47.821
Wait, you've never had sex.

1464
01:02:47.905 --> 01:02:50.030
Yeah, but I know things, though.
Like this.


1465
01:02:50.113 --> 01:02:52.530
If you're worried about
whether you should ask Padgett or not,


1466
01:02:52.613 --> 01:02:53.988
just ask yourself one question.

1467
01:02:54.071 --> 01:02:55.238
Okay, what's that?

1468
01:02:55.321 --> 01:02:56.780
Who kissed who first?

1469
01:02:57.613 --> 01:02:59.405
Actually, she kissed me first.

1470
01:03:00.155 --> 01:03:02.405
So I should ask her to prom, then.

1471
01:03:02.488 --> 01:03:05.238
Um, yeah, but you can't just ask, okay?

1472
01:03:05.321 --> 01:03:07.488
It's lame. You have to prompose.

1473
01:03:08.821 --> 01:03:10.196
What the hell is that?

1474

-[Quinn] Hey.
-Hey.


1479
01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:26.113
[Quinn] No word from Cameron?

1480
01:03:26.196 --> 01:03:30.238
No, he must think I'm such a freak.
I practically sprinted out of there.


1481
01:03:30.321 --> 01:03:33.071
He had the nomination.
Why'd screw it up by kissing him?


1482
01:03:33.155 --> 01:03:34.988
-[Quinn] I do have one theory.
-Yeah?


1483
01:03:35.488 --> 01:03:38.571
You really like him, Padge,
and when you like someone


1484
01:03:38.655 --> 01:03:40.821
the other stuff
just doesn't matter as much.


1485
01:03:40.905 --> 01:03:42.071
I do.

1486
01:03:42.155 --> 01:03:43.446
I do like him.

1487
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:44.363
Yeah.

1488
01:03:45.113 --> 01:03:48.571
Something tells me you might not
have screwed up as much as you think.

-What do you mean?
-[boy] Hey, look, look!

01:03:52.196 --> 01:03:54.238
Oh my God, Cameron.

1491
01:03:54.321 --> 01:03:57.321
I know this isn't
usually my style, obviously,


1492
01:03:57.405 --> 01:04:00.571
but, uh… what do you think?

1493
01:04:00.655 --> 01:04:02.488
-I think yes.
-[Alden] Sorry.


1494
01:04:02.571 --> 01:04:06.821
I hate to interrupt this adorable moment,
but don't you think there's something


1495
01:04:06.905 --> 01:04:08.321
you should tell Cameron first?

1496
01:04:08.405 --> 01:04:10.405
-What are you doing?
-[Quinn] Leave her alone, Alden.


1497
01:04:10.488 --> 01:04:12.738
-[Alden] Shut up, Quinn.
-What's going on?


1498
01:04:13.321 --> 01:04:15.405
Padgett, do you want
to tell him, or should I?


1499
01:04:16.113 --> 01:04:19.155
-What's she talking about?
-What I was trying to tell you yesterday.


1500
01:04:19.238 --> 01:04:20.738
It's… It's actually funny.

1501
01:04:20.821 --> 01:04:22.613
After Jordan and I broke up,

1502
01:04:22.696 --> 01:04:25.405
I lost my sponsorships, my college money,

1503
01:04:25.905 --> 01:04:27.155
so I panicked.

1504
01:04:27.238 --> 01:04:30.280
-Yeah, she's not lying. Total meltdown.
-Yeah, thanks to you, Alden.


1505
01:04:30.363 --> 01:04:32.946
So I made a bet with Alden

1506
01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:36.488
that I could take some person
and… and… and make them over.

Some person. What kind of person?

-Can we talk about this in private?
-No, what kind of person, Padgett?

so she could turn him into prom king.

-Wait. So I was a bet?

-No, I was a fucking bet.

Hey, it's Cameron.
Leave a message, or don't.

01:05:13.238 --> 01:05:16.905
Cameron, it's me again.

1518
01:05:17.905 --> 01:05:22.280
I know I covered this
