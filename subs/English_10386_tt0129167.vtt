1
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.073
Mayday! Mayday!

2
00:01:19.232 --> 00:01:23.078
This is the trawler Annabelle. I've lost
my bearings and I'm taking on water.


3
00:01:23.236 --> 00:01:27.742
My last good reading is

4
00:01:31.912 --> 00:01:34.961
Portland Station to Annabelle.
What is your current position?


5
00:01:35.123 --> 00:01:36.249
I don't know exactly, Portland.

6
00:01:36.416 --> 00:01:39.295
Off the coast somewhere
near Rockwell! Wait.


7
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.638
The lighthouse! I see it!

8
00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:03.761
Over here, honey!

9
00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:09.601
Hey, Mom! You won't believe our good luck.

10
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.012
Guess what I found?

11
00:03:11.178 --> 00:03:13.226
Hogarth, we've been through this before.

12
00:03:13.388 --> 00:03:14.685
No pets.

13
00:03:14.848 --> 00:03:17.684
Oh, but he's not a pet, Mom.
He's a friend.


14
00:03:17.851 --> 00:03:20.854
Hogarth, we've got to rent a room this
year if we're gonna make ends meet,


15
00:03:21.021 --> 00:03:23.023
and no one wants to live in a place
with shredded upholstery.


16
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.284
You'll never know he's there.
I'll keep him in a cage.


17
00:03:25.442 --> 00:03:29.072
Until you feel sorry for him
and set him free in the house!


18
00:03:29.237 --> 00:03:31.535
Do you remember the raccoon, Hogarth?

19
00:03:31.698 --> 00:03:34.201
Ugh... I remember the raccoon.

20
00:03:34.367 --> 00:03:37.291
Please, Mom, at least look at him.

21
00:03:37.454 --> 00:03:40.754
Oh, all right, all right.
Where is this guy?


22
00:03:40.916 --> 00:03:43.214
Annie, I can't read this handwriting.

23
00:03:43.376 --> 00:03:46.220
Yeah, that one, that one should
have lettuce, tomato, extra mayo.


24
00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.883
I will go get him, okay?

25
00:03:51.218 --> 00:03:53.767
So he wants us to hold
the mayo and the mustard.


26
00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:56.773
How about just hold the flavor altogether?

27
00:04:03.063 --> 00:04:04.315
Excuse me.

28
00:04:04.648 --> 00:04:07.572
Excuse me. Sir?

29
00:04:08.485 --> 00:04:09.987
Sir?

30
00:04:10.153 --> 00:04:11.279
Sir!

31
00:04:11.446 --> 00:04:13.244
Excuse me...

32
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.420
- Huh? What's that?
- Please don't move, sir.


33
00:04:18.578 --> 00:04:21.252
My pet's under your table. Don't look!

34
00:04:21.832 --> 00:04:24.426
If you make a scene,
my mom won't let me keep him.


35
00:04:24.584 --> 00:04:26.507
- What kind of pet, kid?
- A squirrel.


36
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:27.922
But don't worry. 
He's friendly.

37
00:04:28.088 --> 00:04:31.092
I'm telling the truth, dang it!
It came from outer space.


38
00:04:31.258 --> 00:04:32.510
I saw it.

39
00:04:32.676 --> 00:04:35.600
And it was headed toward land.

40
00:04:35.762 --> 00:04:38.265
I called the government
in Washington about it.


41
00:04:38.431 --> 00:04:41.935
May, maybe it was a Sputnik
or an invader from Mars.


42
00:04:42.102 --> 00:04:45.151
That's what it is.
It's an invader from Mars!


43
00:04:45.313 --> 00:04:48.863
A spaceship of some kind.
An unidentified flying object.


44
00:04:49.025 --> 00:04:52.780
Unidentified? Knowing you, Earl,
I'd say it was either whiskey or beer.


45
00:04:57.951 --> 00:05:00.625
Hey. I saw it, too.

46
00:05:02.956 --> 00:05:04.048
I rest my case.

47
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.134
- Ah...
- I believe you.


48
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.973
What if it is Sputnik?

49
00:05:12.632 --> 00:05:15.306
Or a flying saucer from Mars?

50
00:05:15.468 --> 00:05:17.015
I bet we could find it.

51
00:05:17.637 --> 00:05:20.356
Sorry, kid. I didn't really see anything.

52
00:05:20.515 --> 00:05:22.813
But if we don't stick up
for the kooks, who will?


53
00:05:22.976 --> 00:05:24.978
Is my son bothering you, sir?

54
00:05:26.897 --> 00:05:29.400
Yes. No!

55
00:05:29.566 --> 00:05:31.159
Call me Dean.

56
00:05:32.152 --> 00:05:34.655
Uh, Hogarth, you were going
to get your pet, honey?


57
00:05:34.821 --> 00:05:35.868
I will, Mom.

58
00:05:36.031 --> 00:05:37.908
- Right after I finish talking with...
- Dean.


59
00:05:38.074 --> 00:05:39.827
Dean.

60
00:05:41.828 --> 00:05:43.830
- Found your pet.
- Where?


61
00:05:43.997 --> 00:05:45.044
It's up my leg, man.

62
00:05:45.206 --> 00:05:47.834
Squirrel's up my pants, Hogarth.
I'm trying not to wig out here.


63
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:49.048
Don't wig out.

64
00:05:49.252 --> 00:05:51.721
Okay. He's heading north now.

65
00:05:52.505 --> 00:05:56.351
I'm sorry, kid. I'd like to apologize
to everyone in advance for this.


66
00:05:59.346 --> 00:06:00.689
Ooh!

67
00:06:03.058 --> 00:06:04.605
- Ah!
- Oh!


68
00:06:07.854 --> 00:06:09.356
Check, please.

69
00:06:09.856 --> 00:06:11.199
It's a rat!

70
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.873
Hello, this is Hogarth Hughes speaking.
Who's calling, please?


71
00:06:19.032 --> 00:06:22.206
Hogarth, honey, 
I'm really sorry, but...

72
00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:23.586
Thank you.

73
00:06:23.745 --> 00:06:27.215
I need to work late tonight.
There's some cold chicken in the icebox.


74
00:06:27.374 --> 00:06:31.712
- You can have that and some carrots...
- I'm way ahead of you, Mom.


75
00:06:31.878 --> 00:06:34.131
- Good. I'll make it up to you, okay?
- Okay.


76
00:06:34.297 --> 00:06:35.924
- I love you, honey.
- Me too.


77
00:06:36.091 --> 00:06:40.813
And, Hogarth, no scary movies,
no late snacks, in bed by 8:00. Got it?


78
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:43.474
Come on, Mom. It's me, remember?

79
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.394
Why, the porpoise can communicate
telepathically, Miss Mullen.


80
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.736
If we can transplant at least 15%
of their brain matter into ours,


81
00:06:51.898 --> 00:06:54.701
we may be able to read minds.

82
00:06:56.486 --> 00:06:59.490
Darn. A perfectly good brain wasted.

83
00:06:59.656 --> 00:07:02.751
I think you've seen enough.
How about a nightcap?


84
00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:04.752
Let's say, my place.

85
00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:06.003
Oh, jeez.

86
00:07:06.162 --> 00:07:09.587
I was thinking the same thing.
Mind reader.


87
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:13.173
Darn. I seem to have left my keys
in the lab.


88
00:07:17.632 --> 00:07:19.179
Hmm.

89
00:07:22.262 --> 00:07:24.310
You're gonna get it.

90
00:07:33.106 --> 00:07:34.449
Who's there?

91
00:07:39.487 --> 00:07:43.287
No. No. No!

92
00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:51.791
Oh, come on!

93
00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.460
Stupid antenna.

94
00:08:28.828 --> 00:08:31.331
Invaders from Mars!

95
00:11:27.465 --> 00:11:29.058
Oh, Hogarth.

96
00:11:34.514 --> 00:11:35.811
Oh!

97
00:11:38.393 --> 00:11:40.020
Hogarth?

98
00:11:40.186 --> 00:11:41.312
Honey?

99
00:11:52.532 --> 00:11:54.375
Hogarth?

100
00:11:55.702 --> 00:11:56.749
Hogarth!

101
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.439
Help! Help! Stop! Help!

102
00:13:45.978 --> 00:13:47.150
Hogarth?

103
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.278
- Hogarth!
- Mom!


104
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.532
What do you think you're doing?

105
00:13:50.691 --> 00:13:53.160
Don't you know better
than to wander off at night alone?


106
00:13:53.319 --> 00:13:54.662
What if something happened to you?

107
00:13:54.987 --> 00:13:56.534
I'm sorry, Mom.

108
00:13:56.823 --> 00:13:59.542
Oh, don't you ever do that
to me again, Hogarth.


109
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.874
I was so scared. 
I thought I'd lost you.

110
00:14:03.454 --> 00:14:06.628
Mom, you won't believe this.

111
00:14:06.791 --> 00:14:09.044
Something ate our TV antenna.

112
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:13.890
- Oh, Hogarth...
- No, no! I'm serious!


113
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.138
Oh, but it's not Sputnik,
like Mr. Stutz thought.


114
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.472
Hogarth...

115
00:14:17.635 --> 00:14:20.138
- No, it's a robot! No, really, it is!
- Hogarth... Hogarth...


116
00:14:20.304 --> 00:14:23.023
- And the robot, it's 100 feet high!
- Please...


117
00:14:23.182 --> 00:14:24.980
- Hogarth!
- And it eats metal!


118
00:14:25.143 --> 00:14:27.362
Stop it! Just...

119
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.817
Stop.

120
00:14:29.355 --> 00:14:31.028
I'm not...

121
00:14:32.567 --> 00:14:34.194
I'm not in the mood.

122
00:14:36.028 --> 00:14:38.372
Come on. Let's go home.

123
00:14:55.548 --> 00:15:00.262
A peaceful stay-at-home kind of day,
in a town very much like your own.


124
00:15:00.428 --> 00:15:02.726
But then, suddenly without warning...

125
00:15:04.265 --> 00:15:06.893
Atomic holocaust!

126
00:15:07.059 --> 00:15:09.528
But how does one survive an atomic attack?

127
00:15:09.687 --> 00:15:11.735
Hey. Did you hear about crazy Mr. Stutz?

128
00:15:11.898 --> 00:15:14.117
He says his boat
ran into a sea monster.

129
00:15:14.275 --> 00:15:16.198
I heard it was sunk by a meteor.

130
00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.237
No, no, no. It was a metal meteor.

131
00:15:18.404 --> 00:15:20.281
- It ate his boat. My dad says...
- Ah...


132
00:15:20.448 --> 00:15:21.916
It wasn't any of those things.

133
00:15:22.074 --> 00:15:23.747
What would you know about it, Poindexter?

134
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.207
- Hogarth!
- Shh...


135
00:15:25.369 --> 00:15:27.121
Don't make me come over there.

136
00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:40.101
It's about 50 or 60 feet high
and it only eats metal.


137
00:15:40.259 --> 00:15:41.556
Shut up, you little spaz!

138
00:15:41.719 --> 00:15:44.893
It's probably been sent by foreign enemies
to take over the country.


139
00:15:45.056 --> 00:15:47.809
We should bomb it to smithereens
before it does.


140
00:15:54.565 --> 00:15:58.411
Why's a nice girl like you
serving coffee to a guy like me?


141
00:15:58.569 --> 00:16:02.449
Particularly when I have the right
to refuse service to anyone.


142
00:16:02.907 --> 00:16:05.660
I'm sorry about yesterday. I, uh...

143
00:16:06.327 --> 00:16:08.079
I'm usually, hmm...

144
00:16:08.246 --> 00:16:09.463
Not like that?

145
00:16:09.622 --> 00:16:11.966
Right.

146
00:16:12.792 --> 00:16:13.964
Oh, it wasn't your fault.

147
00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.133
Hogarth just...

148
00:16:17.129 --> 00:16:18.756
I think he's lonely.

149
00:16:19.298 --> 00:16:20.641
Yeah.

150
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.973
Well, he's a good kid.

151
00:16:24.971 --> 00:16:26.973
Hey, come on outside.

152
00:16:27.139 --> 00:16:28.311
I got something to show you.

153
00:16:30.476 --> 00:16:31.352
Thanks for the scrap, Floyd.

154
00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:34.272
Sorry I can't pay you more.
But it, it's got this,


155
00:16:34.438 --> 00:16:37.863
um, this large bite out of it.

156
00:16:38.025 --> 00:16:41.655
That's why I'm selling it.
It's got a large bite out of it.


157
00:16:41.821 --> 00:16:43.494
What could've done this?

158
00:16:43.656 --> 00:16:46.625
- I told you what.
- Oh, yeah.


159
00:16:46.784 --> 00:16:49.788
Strange invaders.

160
00:16:49.954 --> 00:16:53.174
Thanks for believing me.
I really did call the government.


161
00:16:53.332 --> 00:16:57.132
Yeah. They're sending someone
to take care of the whole thing.


162
00:16:57.295 --> 00:16:59.718
Jeez, Earl. You really are crazy.

163
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.053
I mean, who in the hell would
the government send?


164
00:17:05.636 --> 00:17:08.185
Kent Mansley, United States Government,
Unexplained Phenomena Department.


165
00:17:08.347 --> 00:17:10.065
- Marv Loach. I'm the foreman here.
- What happened here?


166
00:17:10.224 --> 00:17:14.320
Not sure. Sometimes the line'll snap
if the weather is bad, sure.


167
00:17:14.478 --> 00:17:18.316
But for a whole tower to get
twisted up like that, whoa!


168
00:17:19.358 --> 00:17:20.655
It's got me beat.

169
00:17:21.027 --> 00:17:25.999
It's almost like it was bitten off
by some enormous beast.


170
00:17:26.157 --> 00:17:28.034
Enormous beast.

171
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.544
Yeah, what do you think? 
Escaped gorilla?

172
00:17:30.703 --> 00:17:32.046
Uh, what department is that again?

173
00:17:32.204 --> 00:17:36.209
Frankly, I'm not at liberty to reveal the
particulars of the agency I work for


174
00:17:36.375 --> 00:17:37.877
and all that, that implies.

175
00:17:38.044 --> 00:17:40.422
You mean, uh, national security?

176
00:17:40.588 --> 00:17:41.931
Let's put it this way.

177
00:17:42.089 --> 00:17:43.341
Every once in a while, things happen

178
00:17:43.507 --> 00:17:47.102
that just can't be rationalized
in a conventional way.


179
00:17:47.261 --> 00:17:49.889
People wanna know that
their government has a response.


180
00:17:50.056 --> 00:17:52.559
I am that response.

181
00:17:52.725 --> 00:17:54.853
So, were there any witnesses?

182
00:17:55.019 --> 00:17:57.397
Well, sir, if you'll just follow me.

183
00:17:58.505 --> 00:18:01.384
We did find this.

184
00:18:02.693 --> 00:18:04.912
United States Government, huh?

185
00:18:05.112 --> 00:18:07.740
Guess that means something big's
happening here, eh?


186
00:18:07.907 --> 00:18:11.787
No, Marv. Big things happen in big places.

187
00:18:11.952 --> 00:18:15.957
And the sooner I fill out my report,
the sooner I can get back to them.


188
00:18:16.582 --> 00:18:18.584
Enormous beast, yeah...

189
00:18:21.087 --> 00:18:23.465
Biggest thing in this town is probably
the homecoming queen.


190
00:18:23.631 --> 00:18:25.599
Oh, my God!

191
00:18:30.596 --> 00:18:31.722
- Come on, Marv. Come on.
- Okay.


192
00:18:31.889 --> 00:18:33.232
I need a witness.
It's around the corner. Come on.


193
00:18:33.391 --> 00:18:34.563
- Pick up the pace here.
- Don't pull so hard.


194
00:18:34.725 --> 00:18:36.602
I've never seen anything like it.
It's like a big, big "chomp"


195
00:18:36.769 --> 00:18:37.941
- out of the side of the car.
- Take it easy...


196
00:18:38.104 --> 00:18:40.323
It's like a bite out of a ham
sandwich, like a, uh...


197
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.989
What uh, what are we looking
at here, Mr. Manley?


198
00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:50.579
Something big, Marv.

199
00:18:52.785 --> 00:18:54.787
Something big.

200
00:19:01.752 --> 00:19:03.629
Hello!

201
00:19:03.796 --> 00:19:06.470
Come out!

202
00:19:06.966 --> 00:19:11.683
Hey, big metal guy!
I got food here for you!


203
00:19:12.304 --> 00:19:13.601
Metal!

204
00:19:13.764 --> 00:19:16.108
Crunchy, delicious metal!

205
00:19:16.267 --> 00:19:18.690
Come and get it!

206
00:20:56.075 --> 00:20:59.454
So, I guess you're
not gonna hurt me, huh?

207
00:21:06.877 --> 00:21:08.595
The shutoff switch.

208
00:21:10.756 --> 00:21:12.724
You saw me save you.

209
00:21:15.094 --> 00:21:18.564
So, where are you from?

210
00:21:21.058 --> 00:21:23.607
You came from the sky, right?

211
00:21:24.103 --> 00:21:25.605
From up there?

212
00:21:26.105 --> 00:21:27.778
Don't you remember anything?

213
00:21:29.608 --> 00:21:34.489
Hmm. Maybe it's that bump on your head.

214
00:21:36.782 --> 00:21:38.830
Do you talk?

215
00:21:40.119 --> 00:21:43.089
You know, words?
"Blah, blah, blah," like that?


216
00:21:43.247 --> 00:21:44.794
Can you do that? "Blah, blah, blah?"

217
00:21:48.794 --> 00:21:51.843
Well, you get the idea anyway.

218
00:21:52.006 --> 00:21:54.475
Let's see.

219
00:21:54.633 --> 00:21:58.103
See this? This is called a rock.

220
00:21:58.262 --> 00:21:59.434
Rock.

221
00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.307
Rock.

222
00:22:01.473 --> 00:22:02.645
Good.

223
00:22:06.353 --> 00:22:07.479
Rock.

224
00:22:07.855 --> 00:22:09.448
Yes!

225
00:22:11.984 --> 00:22:13.827
- Rock.
- No, no.


226
00:22:14.194 --> 00:22:16.322
That is a tree.

227
00:22:16.989 --> 00:22:19.037
Rock. Tree.

228
00:22:19.199 --> 00:22:20.451
Get it?

229
00:22:21.368 --> 00:22:24.212
Rock. Tree.

230
00:22:24.371 --> 00:22:25.839
That's right!

231
00:22:26.206 --> 00:22:28.504
Wow! My own giant robot.

232
00:22:28.667 --> 00:22:32.137
I am now the luckiest kid in America!

233
00:22:32.296 --> 00:22:33.388
This is unbelievable.

234
00:22:33.547 --> 00:22:35.345
This is the greatest discovery since...

235
00:22:35.507 --> 00:22:38.135
I don't know, television or something!

236
00:22:38.302 --> 00:22:40.521
I gotta tell someone.
I should call some...


237
00:22:40.679 --> 00:22:42.181
No, they'll panic.

238
00:22:42.348 --> 00:22:45.192
People always wig out and start shooting
when they see something big like you.


239
00:22:45.351 --> 00:22:49.026
- Hmm?
- Oh, wig out. It means crazy.


240
00:22:49.188 --> 00:22:50.360
You know, like, uh...

241
00:22:53.859 --> 00:22:55.702
No, no, no! Don't do that!

242
00:22:55.986 --> 00:22:58.364
That's the kind of stuff
that makes them shoot at you.


243
00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.909
Two nights ago, at approximately

244
00:23:02.076 --> 00:23:06.047
detected an unidentified object
entering Earth's atmosphere.


245
00:23:06.205 --> 00:23:09.379
Losing contact with it two-and-a-half
miles off the coast of Rockwell.


246
00:23:09.541 --> 00:23:12.420
Some assumed it was a large meteor
or a downed satellite.


247
00:23:12.586 --> 00:23:15.339
But my office in Washington received
a call from someone


248
00:23:15.506 --> 00:23:18.680
who reported an actual encounter
with the object.


249
00:23:18.842 --> 00:23:21.891
This is no meteor, gentlemen.

250
00:23:22.054 --> 00:23:25.524
This is something much more serious. So...

251
00:23:25.683 --> 00:23:29.771
So, we can't call Ripley's Believe It
or Not because they wouldn't believe it.


252
00:23:29.937 --> 00:23:31.564
And...

253
00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:34.609
Oh, it's getting dark.
And if I don't get home soon


254
00:23:34.775 --> 00:23:36.573
Mom's gonna wonder where I am.

255
00:23:36.735 --> 00:23:41.115
If she comes looking for me and sees you
then we got the screaming problem again.


256
00:23:41.281 --> 00:23:44.911
So, for now, would you, you know, just...

257
00:23:45.077 --> 00:23:47.250
Just stay here, okay?

258
00:23:47.579 --> 00:23:48.922
I'll come back tomorrow.

259
00:23:54.253 --> 00:23:55.755
Wow.

260
00:23:56.714 --> 00:23:58.591
Well, goodbye.

261
00:24:02.219 --> 00:24:03.436
No, no.

262
00:24:03.929 --> 00:24:05.146
Me go.

263
00:24:05.305 --> 00:24:06.773
You stay.

264
00:24:06.932 --> 00:24:08.775
No following.

265
00:24:09.643 --> 00:24:11.395
Good.

266
00:24:13.063 --> 00:24:14.610
I told you!

267
00:24:14.773 --> 00:24:18.403
I'll come back tomorrow!

268
00:24:18.569 --> 00:24:20.947
Now, stay!

269
00:24:24.825 --> 00:24:26.793
No, no, no!

270
00:24:26.952 --> 00:24:28.795
Bad robot!

271
00:24:43.302 --> 00:24:46.977
Look, you can't go stomping around
and you can't come with me.


272
00:24:47.139 --> 00:24:49.141
My mom will wig out.

273
00:24:50.508 --> 00:24:51.606
That's right.

274
00:24:51.769 --> 00:24:57.151
So you have got to stay in the forest,
and I'll bring you some food tomorrow.


275
00:24:57.316 --> 00:25:01.116
But I gotta go home now.

276
00:25:01.945 --> 00:25:03.822
So, goodbye.

277
00:25:09.953 --> 00:25:11.170
Hmm...

278
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.502
Hey.

279
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.674
Hey, wait a minute!
What do you think you're doing?


280
00:25:17.836 --> 00:25:20.134
Look at this mess!

281
00:25:25.511 --> 00:25:26.728
Oh, no.

282
00:25:28.013 --> 00:25:29.185
Put it back!

283
00:25:29.348 --> 00:25:30.895
Put it back right now!

284
00:25:32.184 --> 00:25:35.358
Help me! I need your help!

285
00:25:37.689 --> 00:25:39.066
Good, good!

286
00:25:44.863 --> 00:25:46.706
Okay, put them together. 
See, like this.

287
00:25:46.865 --> 00:25:48.367
This one here, that one there.

288
00:25:49.743 --> 00:25:53.835
Okay, over, over. Good, good.
Now the other one.


289
00:25:53.997 --> 00:25:56.045
Okay. Good enough. Let's go!

290
00:25:58.877 --> 00:26:00.925
What the...

291
00:26:01.713 --> 00:26:04.933
That's fine! Leave it alone!
The train is coming!


292
00:26:05.092 --> 00:26:06.890
The train is coming!

293
00:26:07.845 --> 00:26:09.222
Come on, let's go!

294
00:26:26.238 --> 00:26:29.742
Oh, no, no, no, no.

295
00:26:32.744 --> 00:26:34.246
You're alive!

296
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.094
Hello? Anybody out there?

297
00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:49.887
Oh, we're in trouble now.

298
00:26:50.053 --> 00:26:51.100
Are you all right?

299
00:26:51.263 --> 00:26:52.936
Look, I've changed my mind.
You can follow me home.


300
00:26:53.098 --> 00:26:54.395
Okay. Let's go.

301
00:26:55.809 --> 00:26:57.277
Mayor's office.

302
00:26:57.436 --> 00:26:59.655
What? A train accident?

303
00:26:59.813 --> 00:27:01.611
What do you mean,
he hit a giant creature?

304
00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.613
What creature could be big enough to...

305
00:27:05.277 --> 00:27:06.324
I need your car.

306
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:48.327
Hmm...

307
00:27:48.654 --> 00:27:50.998
Wow! You can fix yourself?

308
00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:53.117
Neato.

309
00:27:53.283 --> 00:27:56.495
Uh-oh, Mom's home. Just stay
here, okay? I'll be back. Bye!


310
00:27:57.996 --> 00:28:00.670
Bye. Hmm?

311
00:28:08.674 --> 00:28:10.392
What happened here?

312
00:28:11.176 --> 00:28:14.020
Go on. Tell him what you saw, Frank.

313
00:28:15.847 --> 00:28:22.731
You're not gonna believe this,
but it was a giant metal man.


314
00:28:27.234 --> 00:28:30.704
Does anyone know where I can get
to a telephone nearby?


315
00:28:34.074 --> 00:28:35.667
Would you say grace, please?

316
00:28:41.707 --> 00:28:43.050
Oh, my God!

317
00:28:44.376 --> 00:28:47.550
Um... Oh, my God,

318
00:28:47.921 --> 00:28:50.049
we, uh, thank you.

319
00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:52.722
For the

320
00:28:52.884 --> 00:28:55.103
food that Mom

321
00:28:55.262 --> 00:28:57.390
has put in front of us and... Stop!

322
00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:00.767
The, the devil

323
00:29:01.059 --> 00:29:04.859
from doing bad things and, uh...

324
00:29:05.022 --> 00:29:07.241
Get out of here! Ah...

325
00:29:08.233 --> 00:29:09.405
Satan?

326
00:29:10.277 --> 00:29:13.247
Go! Go, so...

327
00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.249
That we may live in peace. Amen.

328
00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:17.747
Amen.

329
00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:22.131
That was, hmm, really unusual, Hogarth.

330
00:29:22.581 --> 00:29:25.551
- Forgot to wash my hands.
- Well, uh, okay.


331
00:29:29.779 --> 00:29:30.972
Tomorrowland...

332
00:29:31.256 --> 00:29:33.554
Promise of things to come.

333
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.228
Stop, stop, stop!

334
00:29:40.766 --> 00:29:43.064
All right. Come on. Come on. Over here.

335
00:30:00.786 --> 00:30:02.459
Come on. Come on, over here. Come on.

336
00:30:04.956 --> 00:30:08.798
Hey there, scout. Kent Mansley.
I work for the government.


337
00:30:09.377 --> 00:30:11.220
Hogarth?

338
00:30:13.799 --> 00:30:14.971
Hogarth?

339
00:30:15.258 --> 00:30:17.636
Hey there, scout. Kent Mansley.

340
00:30:17.803 --> 00:30:19.430
Work for the government.
Your parents home?


341
00:30:19.596 --> 00:30:21.473
- We're eating.
- Mmm, boy.


342
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.438
Who's there, honey?

343
00:30:23.767 --> 00:30:24.984
Oh, hello there.

344
00:30:25.143 --> 00:30:26.816
- Do you have a telephone I could use?
- Yes.


345
00:30:26.978 --> 00:30:28.855
- There's one in the kitchen.
- Well, thank you.


346
00:30:29.022 --> 00:30:30.820
Thank you very much.

347
00:30:31.274 --> 00:30:33.618
Here. Pretend you're a gangster.

348
00:30:35.654 --> 00:30:37.281
Damn it, Mansley.
You call me at home for this?


349
00:30:37.447 --> 00:30:40.542
You don't understand, sir. 
It ate my car.

350
00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.122
And you saw this happen?

351
00:30:42.285 --> 00:30:46.210
No, I didn't actually see it.
It went off into the woods.


352
00:30:46.373 --> 00:30:48.216
So, you don't have any evidence?

353
00:30:48.375 --> 00:30:50.173
But, but, sir, 
I've got an eyewitness!

354
00:30:50.335 --> 00:30:52.008
An eyewitness with a concussion.

355
00:30:52.546 --> 00:30:54.844
This thing... This thing is a menace.

356
00:30:55.006 --> 00:30:58.518
It tore up the power station.
It... It caused a train wreck!


357
00:30:58.677 --> 00:31:03.516
What did? Tell me again, Mansley,
and this time listen to yourself.


358
00:31:05.183 --> 00:31:06.981
A giant metal monster.

359
00:31:09.646 --> 00:31:12.365
Please, sir. I've got a feeling
about this one.


360
00:31:12.816 --> 00:31:15.990
That's lovely, Kent.
But let me try to explain how this works.


361
00:31:16.194 --> 00:31:19.994
If you told me you'd found, say,
a giant footprint,


362
00:31:20.157 --> 00:31:22.706
I might send over an expert
to make a plaster cast of it.


363
00:31:22.868 --> 00:31:24.370
Hell! You get me
a photograph of this thing


364
00:31:24.536 --> 00:31:26.538
and I could probably
get some troops over there!


365
00:31:26.705 --> 00:31:29.208
But you tell me you've got a "feeling"?

366
00:31:29.374 --> 00:31:31.422
All right then, fine. 
You want evidence?

367
00:31:31.585 --> 00:31:36.386
I'll get you evidence. And when I do,
I'm gonna wanna a memo distributed.


368
00:31:36.548 --> 00:31:37.595
That sounds swell, Kent.

369
00:31:37.757 --> 00:31:40.681
I'm gonna want that memo
carbon copied and redistributed...


370
00:31:55.567 --> 00:31:58.116
Hi. Thanks for the use of your phone.

371
00:31:58.945 --> 00:32:01.573
Well, thank you for the use
of your phone, Mrs...


372
00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.914
Hughes. Annie Hughes.
And this is my son, Hogarth.


373
00:32:05.076 --> 00:32:07.078
Thank you, Annie. Hobart.

374
00:32:07.412 --> 00:32:09.289
That's Hogarth!

375
00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:15.420
Hogarth. What an embarrassing name.
Might as well call him Zeppo or something.


376
00:32:15.587 --> 00:32:18.261
What kind of a sick person
would name a kid Hogar...


377
00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.552
Hog Hug...

378
00:32:21.718 --> 00:32:23.436
Hog Hug. Hogarth Hughes!

379
00:32:27.933 --> 00:32:30.436
Kent Mansley. You work for the government.

380
00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:32.771
I wasn't gonna say that.

381
00:32:33.104 --> 00:32:35.277
I have something for you, Hogarth.

382
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.784
Your BB gun. Where did you find that?

383
00:32:37.943 --> 00:32:39.286
Up at the power station.

384
00:32:39.444 --> 00:32:42.118
- Hogarth was out there the other night.
- Really?


385
00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.578
See anything unusual, Hogarth?

386
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:50.127
No... thing... unusual, really.

387
00:32:55.168 --> 00:32:56.340
Gotta use the bathroom.

388
00:33:04.511 --> 00:33:06.263
Strange, he's so tightlipped now.

389
00:33:06.429 --> 00:33:08.147
And the other night
he couldn't stop talking.


390
00:33:08.306 --> 00:33:10.479
I mean, 100-foot robots and whatnot.

391
00:33:10.642 --> 00:33:12.315
A hundred-foot robot?

392
00:33:13.427 --> 00:33:15.270
That's nutty!

393
00:33:15.614 --> 00:33:18.357
- What else did he say?
- No, wait, stop!


394
00:33:19.484 --> 00:33:20.827
Excuse me.

395
00:33:25.198 --> 00:33:26.324
Hogarth?

396
00:33:26.491 --> 00:33:27.993
What is going on in there?

397
00:33:31.037 --> 00:33:32.664
Are you all right?

398
00:33:32.831 --> 00:33:34.299
I'm fine.

399
00:33:34.457 --> 00:33:39.505
You know, this sort of thing is why
it's so important to really chew your food.


400
00:33:45.159 --> 00:33:47.895
Hogarth? Hogarth?

401
00:33:48.054 --> 00:33:50.728
- Mom! A little privacy?
- Sorry.


402
00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:52.517
- Ow. Ha-ha. Ow.
- Sorry.


403
00:33:52.684 --> 00:33:54.686
Oh, Lord, he's been acting strange lately.

404
00:33:54.853 --> 00:33:55.900
That hurt.

405
00:34:06.865 --> 00:34:08.867
Thank you again, Annie.

406
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:15.882
Good night, Hogarth. I'm sure
we'll see each other again real soon.


407
00:34:22.547 --> 00:34:27.223
If you're gonna stay here
you gotta keep better track of yourself.


408
00:34:27.385 --> 00:34:28.728
Sheesh.

409
00:34:28.928 --> 00:34:33.434
Anyway, I thought you'd like, you know,
a bedtime story or something.


410
00:34:33.683 --> 00:34:36.402
I've got some really cool ones.

411
00:34:37.062 --> 00:34:40.236
MAD Magazine, very funny.

412
00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:43.068
The Spirit, very cool.

413
00:34:43.735 --> 00:34:45.112
Boy's Life... Ehh...

414
00:34:45.278 --> 00:34:46.575
Oh, here.

415
00:34:46.905 --> 00:34:49.408
This guy is Superman.

416
00:34:49.908 --> 00:34:51.626
Sure, he's famous now,

417
00:34:51.785 --> 00:34:53.879
- but he started off just like you.
- Hmm...


418
00:34:54.079 --> 00:34:57.424
Crash-landed on Earth.
Didn't know what he was doing.


419
00:34:57.582 --> 00:35:02.429
But he only uses his powers for good,
never for evil.


420
00:35:03.088 --> 00:35:04.590
Remember that.

421
00:35:10.261 --> 00:35:12.935
Oh, that's Atomo, the metal menace.

422
00:35:13.223 --> 00:35:15.772
He's not the hero. 
He's the villain.

423
00:35:16.059 --> 00:35:17.732
He's not like you.

424
00:35:17.936 --> 00:35:19.563
You're a good guy.

425
00:35:20.063 --> 00:35:21.565
Like Superman.

426
00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.613
Superman.

427
00:35:27.904 --> 00:35:30.623
- Oh, you're hungry, aren't you?
- Mmm-hmm.


428
00:35:30.782 --> 00:35:33.126
But I don't have any metal here.

429
00:35:33.743 --> 00:35:35.290
Just follow me.

430
00:35:37.247 --> 00:35:38.794
Pick me up, okay?

431
00:35:47.799 --> 00:35:49.267
Wow.

432
00:35:50.802 --> 00:35:52.429
Okay, now, march!

433
00:35:57.475 --> 00:35:58.818
Whoo.

434
00:36:12.365 --> 00:36:13.491
Hmm?

435
00:36:13.658 --> 00:36:15.376
Oh, yeah. That's Rockwell.

436
00:36:15.702 --> 00:36:18.330
- Nice place, huh?
- Rockwell?


437
00:36:18.496 --> 00:36:20.999
Yes, I was born right down there.

438
00:36:21.166 --> 00:36:22.543
Rockwell!

439
00:36:24.794 --> 00:36:26.512
No, stop! Look out for the cow!

440
00:36:27.338 --> 00:36:32.184
Come on, no, not there!
Please stop. No, stop!


441
00:36:34.554 --> 00:36:36.522
We can't go there yet.

442
00:36:36.723 --> 00:36:39.351
People just aren't ready for you.

443
00:36:51.863 --> 00:36:53.365
That was close.

444
00:36:53.531 --> 00:36:55.875
We can't go running
around like that, okay?


445
00:36:56.034 --> 00:36:58.412
- Hmm...
- Hey, look!


446
00:36:58.578 --> 00:37:00.000
Hmm?

447
00:37:01.414 --> 00:37:05.044
I guess that would be okay to eat.
It's been there for months.


448
00:37:06.669 --> 00:37:08.592
Oh, no. We gotta hide!

449
00:37:09.047 --> 00:37:10.390
You know, hide?

450
00:37:10.548 --> 00:37:12.516
It's when you... 
You know, when you...

451
00:37:12.675 --> 00:37:14.552
Just get behind something, quick!

452
00:37:18.932 --> 00:37:20.229
Don't move.

453
00:37:48.086 --> 00:37:50.760
Our troubles are over.

454
00:37:55.593 --> 00:37:56.719
This is it.

455
00:37:56.886 --> 00:37:58.479
All you can eat.

456
00:38:11.985 --> 00:38:14.579
Shh. Turn it off!

457
00:38:19.951 --> 00:38:21.794
Come on, just turn it off!

458
00:38:30.336 --> 00:38:31.963
Oh, no.

459
00:38:32.797 --> 00:38:33.798
All right, who's out there?

460
00:38:37.302 --> 00:38:40.806
Hey, hey, I know you. Squirrel boy.

461
00:38:40.972 --> 00:38:42.144
Hogarth.

462
00:38:42.307 --> 00:38:44.935
By night, known as Hogarth. Got it.

463
00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:47.149
Well, come on inside, kid.

464
00:38:47.312 --> 00:38:48.655
Sorry about the crowbar.

465
00:38:49.314 --> 00:38:52.363
You'd be surprised how many
people wanna steal scrap.


466
00:38:52.525 --> 00:38:56.325
But, man, once I turn it into art,
I can't give it away.


467
00:38:56.487 --> 00:38:57.704
I mean, what am I?

468
00:38:57.864 --> 00:39:01.494
A junkman who sells art
or an artist who sells junk?


469
00:39:01.659 --> 00:39:03.036
You tell me.

470
00:39:03.202 --> 00:39:05.330
I like it... I think.

471
00:39:06.164 --> 00:39:10.340
Listen, you're, you're not
gonna call my mom, are you?


472
00:39:10.501 --> 00:39:12.344
She doesn't know I'm out. I...

473
00:39:12.503 --> 00:39:16.133
Don't worry, kid. Look, it's not my style
to report a guy to the authorities.


474
00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:19.848
I'm gonna have some coffee.
What do you want, some, uh,


475
00:39:20.011 --> 00:39:22.560
milk, or what? Milk?

476
00:39:22.722 --> 00:39:24.019
Coffee's fine.

477
00:39:25.975 --> 00:39:28.353
Yeah. I drink it. I'm hip.

478
00:39:28.519 --> 00:39:33.358
I don't know. This is espresso,
you know? It's like coffee-zilla.


479
00:39:33.524 --> 00:39:35.572
I said, I'm hip.

480
00:39:38.696 --> 00:39:40.323
So she moved me up a grade
because I wasn't fitting in.


481
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:41.833
So, now I'm even more not fitting in.

482
00:39:41.991 --> 00:39:43.334
I was getting good grades.
You know, like all A's.


483
00:39:43.493 --> 00:39:44.745
So, my mom says, "You need stimulation."

484
00:39:44.911 --> 00:39:46.538
And I go, "No, I'm
stimulated enough right now."


485
00:39:46.704 --> 00:39:47.751
- That's for sure.
- She goes,


486
00:39:47.997 --> 00:39:49.089
"Uh-uh, you don't have a challenge.

487
00:39:49.248 --> 00:39:51.046
"You need a challenge."
So, now I'm challenged, all right.


488
00:39:51.209 --> 00:39:53.177
I'm challenged to hold on
to my lunch money,


489
00:39:53.336 --> 00:39:54.929
because of all the big mooses
who wanna pound me


490
00:39:55.088 --> 00:39:57.056
because I'm a shrimpy dork
who thinks he's smarter than them.


491
00:39:57.215 --> 00:39:59.434
But I don't think I am smarter,
I just do the stupid homework.


492
00:39:59.592 --> 00:40:01.014
If everyone else just did
the stupid homework


493
00:40:01.177 --> 00:40:03.771
they could move up a grade and get
pounded too. Is there anymore coffee?


494
00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:06.058
Look, it's really
none of my business, kid,


495
00:40:06.224 --> 00:40:09.899
but, um, who cares
what these creeps think, you know?


496
00:40:10.061 --> 00:40:12.905
They don't decide who you are. You do.

497
00:40:13.064 --> 00:40:16.238
You are who you choose to be.

498
00:40:19.404 --> 00:40:20.530
Did you hear that?

499
00:40:20.697 --> 00:40:22.119
No, wait. Stop!

500
00:40:34.585 --> 00:40:36.087
- It's okay!
- My God!


501
00:40:36.254 --> 00:40:38.427
- He isn't gonna...
- Run, kid! Run!


502
00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:44.388
It's okay. He isn't...

503
00:40:44.554 --> 00:40:47.648
- It's okay. He isn't gonna hurt me.
- Oh, hey...


504
00:40:47.807 --> 00:40:49.559
Don't squash him! No! Don't...

505
00:40:49.726 --> 00:40:51.273
Do not...

506
00:40:51.436 --> 00:40:53.609
Squash him.

507
00:40:54.605 --> 00:40:55.777
His name is Dean.

508
00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:57.908
We like Dean.

509
00:40:58.735 --> 00:41:00.078
Dean.

510
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.621
So... Where'd, uh, where'd he come from?

511
00:41:06.117 --> 00:41:07.619
He doesn't remember.

512
00:41:07.785 --> 00:41:10.083
He's like a little kid.

513
00:41:10.246 --> 00:41:12.624
Little. Yeah.

514
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:15.293
Wait a minute. 
You can talk to him?

515
00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.431
Kinda. He can't say a lot of words yet
but he understands things pretty good.


516
00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:21.606
Oh, yeah. I see.

517
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:28.144
He needs food and shelter.

518
00:41:40.985 --> 00:41:44.159
You got plenty of room here.
This place is perfect.


519
00:41:44.322 --> 00:41:45.539
Go away.

520
00:41:45.698 --> 00:41:49.168
I can have him push the door down.
You know I can.


521
00:41:49.327 --> 00:41:51.671
Hogarth. I can't hide it here.

522
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:53.831
- "Him," not "it."
- Whatever.


523
00:41:53.998 --> 00:41:56.217
You don't even know where "he" came from

524
00:41:56.375 --> 00:41:58.628
or, or what the hell "he" is!

525
00:41:58.795 --> 00:42:00.513
He's my friend.

526
00:42:01.464 --> 00:42:04.183
Yeah, what am I? 
Am I your friend?

527
00:42:04.342 --> 00:42:06.515
Bring some Franken-bot with
out-of-state plates over here,


528
00:42:06.677 --> 00:42:08.520
make me change my tune.

529
00:42:08.679 --> 00:42:11.523
I don't like that jazz. God, I'm tired.

530
00:42:11.682 --> 00:42:13.525
So, he can stay?

531
00:42:13.684 --> 00:42:17.655
Tonight. Tomorrow, I don't know.
I don't know about tomorrow.


532
00:42:26.697 --> 00:42:28.370
Sleep tight.

533
00:42:28.533 --> 00:42:30.535
I'll see you tomorrow.

534
00:42:44.715 --> 00:42:46.888
- You're up already?
- Just making the bed.


535
00:42:47.051 --> 00:42:50.772
That's nice. Come downstairs.
I have a surprise for you.


536
00:42:55.393 --> 00:42:57.942
Morning, sport. Sleep well?

537
00:42:58.104 --> 00:42:59.731
Mom?

538
00:43:00.398 --> 00:43:03.743
Isn't it wonderful, Hogarth?
We finally rented our room.


539
00:43:03.901 --> 00:43:06.620
Ugh. I'm not very hungry.

540
00:43:13.911 --> 00:43:16.414
Oh, yeah.

541
00:43:18.416 --> 00:43:20.464
Hello, this is Hogarth Hughes speaking.
Who's calling, please?


542
00:43:20.626 --> 00:43:23.095
I said he could stay the night, kid.

543
00:43:23.254 --> 00:43:24.301
It's morning now.

544
00:43:24.463 --> 00:43:26.465
Look, I'll try to come over, okay?

545
00:43:26.632 --> 00:43:28.930
But there's this weird guy here
who's watching me.


546
00:43:29.093 --> 00:43:30.219
What's that supposed to mean?

547
00:43:30.386 --> 00:43:33.936
I got this big, giant...
Giant thing out here.


548
00:43:34.098 --> 00:43:36.942
- I can't talk right now, okay? Bye.
- Hogarth!


549
00:43:37.101 --> 00:43:38.978
Who was that, sport? 
Friend of yours?

550
00:43:39.145 --> 00:43:41.318
Yeah. He's, uh, a new kid.

551
00:43:41.647 --> 00:43:46.278
What... I...
Hey, hey! Stop! Stop that! Stop it!


552
00:43:47.653 --> 00:43:50.406
Hey, mind if I ask you a few
questions there, buckaroo?


553
00:43:50.573 --> 00:43:53.622
Now, why would you tell your mom
about a giant robot, slugger?


554
00:43:53.784 --> 00:43:55.457
Say, what'd you see at the power station?
Huh, tiger?


555
00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:57.964
You tell anyone else about this, buddy?
How big is this thing, ranger?


556
00:43:58.122 --> 00:43:59.419
Been in the forest lately?
Hey. Where you going?


557
00:43:59.582 --> 00:44:01.255
Champ? Slugger? Hey, cowboy?
Where you goin'?


558
00:44:01.417 --> 00:44:03.795
- Where you goin'?
- I'm going out!


559
00:44:03.961 --> 00:44:06.931
Why don't you take Mr. Mansley with you?
Show him the sights.


560
00:44:07.089 --> 00:44:08.966
Oh, Mom, the sights?

561
00:44:09.133 --> 00:44:12.770
Hey, I'd love that. Give us a chance to get
acquainted, swap some stories, huh, chief?


562
00:44:12.929 --> 00:44:15.023
There are two kinds
of metal in this yard.

563
00:44:15.181 --> 00:44:16.808
Scrap and art.

564
00:44:16.974 --> 00:44:19.318
If you gotta eat one of them,
eat the scrap.


565
00:44:19.477 --> 00:44:23.948
What you currently have
in your mouth is art!


566
00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:28.657
Art?

567
00:44:34.784 --> 00:44:36.661
Oh, forget it. Forget it!

568
00:44:36.827 --> 00:44:39.956
It's gone. It's...

569
00:44:40.122 --> 00:44:42.966
Hmm. That's not bad.

570
00:44:46.295 --> 00:44:49.139
First, you take a chocolate bar.
Any bar'll do.


571
00:44:49.298 --> 00:44:50.845
- Oh.
- Do you mind if I, uh...


572
00:44:51.008 --> 00:44:52.510
No, knock yourself out, skipper.

573
00:44:53.302 --> 00:44:56.306
You crumble up the chocolate
into little pieces.


574
00:44:56.472 --> 00:44:59.851
Then you kind of stir it
into the ice cream. See?


575
00:45:00.017 --> 00:45:02.145
Yes, I see. What
do you call this again?

576
00:45:02.311 --> 00:45:04.905
Landslide. It's new. Very new.

577
00:45:05.064 --> 00:45:10.537
Mmm. Landslide. Topnotch. Mmm.

578
00:45:10.695 --> 00:45:15.371
You know, Hogarth, we live
in a strange and wondrous time.


579
00:45:15.533 --> 00:45:17.206
The Atomic Age.

580
00:45:17.368 --> 00:45:20.338
But there's a dark side
to progress, Hogarth.


581
00:45:20.496 --> 00:45:22.043
Ever hear of Sputnik?

582
00:45:22.206 --> 00:45:24.584
Yeah, it's the first satellite in space.

583
00:45:24.875 --> 00:45:28.550
Foreign satellite, Hogarth,
and all that that implies.


584
00:45:28.713 --> 00:45:31.387
Even now, it orbits overhead.

585
00:45:31.549 --> 00:45:33.176
Boop. Boop.

586
00:45:33.342 --> 00:45:35.219
Watching us.

587
00:45:35.386 --> 00:45:37.388
We can't see it, but it's there.

588
00:45:37.555 --> 00:45:40.058
Much like that giant thing in the woods.

589
00:45:40.391 --> 00:45:42.234
We don't know what it is
or what it can do.


590
00:45:42.393 --> 00:45:44.111
I don't feel safe, Hogarth.

591
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:46.568
- Do you?
- What are you talking about?


592
00:45:46.731 --> 00:45:50.361
What am I talking about?
What am I talking about?


593
00:45:50.735 --> 00:45:53.238
I'm talking about
your goldarned security, Hogarth!


594
00:45:53.404 --> 00:45:55.247
While you're snoozing
in your little jammies,


595
00:45:55.406 --> 00:45:57.875
back in Washington,
we're wide-awake and worried. Why?


596
00:45:58.034 --> 00:46:00.913
Because everyone wants
what we have, Hogarth! Everyone!


597
00:46:01.078 --> 00:46:03.046
You think this metal man is fun.
But who built it?


598
00:46:03.205 --> 00:46:06.755
The Russians? The Chinese? Martians?
Canadians? I don't care!


599
00:46:06.917 --> 00:46:09.261
All I know is, we didn't build it,
and that's reason enough


600
00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:12.094
to assume the worst
and blow it to kingdom come!


601
00:46:12.256 --> 00:46:15.601
Now, you're going to tell me about
this thing. You're gonna lead me to it.


602
00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.229
And we are going to destroy it
before it destroys us!


603
00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:22.312
Just hold that thought
and stay right there.


604
00:46:22.475 --> 00:46:23.977
Oh-oh.

605
00:46:30.066 --> 00:46:31.818
Little lower. Little bit lower...

606
00:46:31.984 --> 00:46:34.612
Hey. I thought you were in trouble.

607
00:46:34.779 --> 00:46:36.156
That sucks. Let me just... Up a little.

608
00:46:36.322 --> 00:46:39.075
I had to ditch this weird guy
who's staying at our house.


609
00:46:39.241 --> 00:46:41.289
It took me hours to shake him!

610
00:46:41.452 --> 00:46:43.420
I kill myself to get out here!

611
00:46:43.579 --> 00:46:47.129
And you have him doing... 
Arts and crafts!

612
00:46:47.291 --> 00:46:50.090
You got a problem with
arts and crafts, little man?


613
00:46:50.252 --> 00:46:54.177
He's a giant robot, Dean.
It's a little undignified.


614
00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:57.810
Yeah? Well, smart guy,
what would you have him do?


615
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:04.810
Main systems on. Main engines.

616
00:47:04.975 --> 00:47:06.648
One, two and three.

617
00:47:06.811 --> 00:47:12.489
All systems go.
Five, four, three two, one!


618
00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:13.947
Blast off!

619
00:47:24.995 --> 00:47:27.373
We're landing. 
We're landing!

620
00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:29.963
We're landing!

621
00:47:35.881 --> 00:47:38.350
Say, can you guys
cool yourselves a little?


622
00:47:38.509 --> 00:47:40.352
I feel like we're pressing our luck here.

623
00:47:40.511 --> 00:47:42.513
Hey, baby, we are cool!

624
00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:45.524
Welcome to downtown Coolsville.

625
00:47:45.683 --> 00:47:47.685
Population? Us.

626
00:47:47.852 --> 00:47:52.858
Well, can you move Coolsville
to someplace less conspicuous?


627
00:47:53.023 --> 00:47:55.993
- How about the lake?
- Okay.


628
00:47:56.152 --> 00:47:58.871
Aw, come with us. It'll be fun.

629
00:48:49.622 --> 00:48:53.593
This can't last forever, Hogarth.
We gotta tell somebody about him.


630
00:48:53.751 --> 00:48:55.594
Ah, you worry too much.

631
00:48:58.464 --> 00:49:01.434
Hey, Dean! Watch this!

632
00:49:01.592 --> 00:49:03.765
All right, we're watching. 
We're watching.

633
00:49:03.928 --> 00:49:07.102
This one's for professionals only!

634
00:49:08.933 --> 00:49:10.435
Banzai!

635
00:49:17.854 --> 00:49:22.075
Come on in! The water's great!

636
00:49:22.838 --> 00:49:24.115
No, thanks.

637
00:49:24.281 --> 00:49:26.283
You weenie!

638
00:49:27.952 --> 00:49:28.999
Come on in.

639
00:49:29.161 --> 00:49:32.256
It's really, really refreshing.

640
00:49:39.463 --> 00:49:42.012
What? You too?

641
00:49:42.174 --> 00:49:45.474
You big baby!

642
00:49:50.849 --> 00:49:52.817
Banzai!

643
00:50:24.883 --> 00:50:26.851
Whoo!

644
00:50:30.806 --> 00:50:32.353
- Hey.
- Yeah?


645
00:50:32.516 --> 00:50:35.395
- You're right in the middle of the road!
- Yeah?


646
00:50:35.561 --> 00:50:36.687
All right.

647
00:50:40.357 --> 00:50:44.032
I think that's enough fun for one day.

648
00:50:58.542 --> 00:51:00.544
Are you okay in there, Mr. Mansley?

649
00:51:00.711 --> 00:51:02.738
I'm back with the toilet paper you needed.

650
00:51:02.904 --> 00:51:06.225
Thanks! I think I'm feeling better now.

651
00:51:06.383 --> 00:51:09.011
Much. Much better.

652
00:51:17.019 --> 00:51:19.067
It's beautiful, huh?

653
00:51:19.229 --> 00:51:20.902
Hey, look!

654
00:51:22.566 --> 00:51:24.409
It's a deer.

655
00:51:24.568 --> 00:51:25.785
- Deer?
- Shh.


656
00:51:25.944 --> 00:51:27.571
Let's get closer.

657
00:52:00.646 --> 00:52:02.819
Hmm. Well, I guess he decided to...

658
00:52:11.782 --> 00:52:13.830
It's the monster!

659
00:52:16.912 --> 00:52:18.289
Oh, no.

660
00:52:25.963 --> 00:52:28.182
It's dead.

661
00:52:30.634 --> 00:52:31.806
Dead?

662
00:52:34.972 --> 00:52:36.440
Don't do that!

663
00:52:38.308 --> 00:52:39.480
Why?

664
00:52:39.643 --> 00:52:42.442
It's dead. Understand?

665
00:52:42.604 --> 00:52:45.983
They shot it with that gun.

666
00:52:55.033 --> 00:52:56.501
Hey, what's wrong?

667
00:52:58.495 --> 00:53:01.715
- Guns.
- Yes. Guns kill.


668
00:53:02.833 --> 00:53:05.507
Guns kill.

669
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:34.831
I know you feel bad about the deer.
But it's not your fault.


670
00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:36.492
Things die.

671
00:53:36.658 --> 00:53:38.501
It's part of life.

672
00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.833
It's bad to kill.

673
00:53:40.996 --> 00:53:43.044
But it's not bad to die.

674
00:53:43.582 --> 00:53:45.755
You die?

675
00:53:45.918 --> 00:53:50.719
Well, yes, someday.

676
00:53:50.881 --> 00:53:53.179
I die?

677
00:53:53.342 --> 00:53:55.060
I don't know.

678
00:53:55.219 --> 00:53:59.690
You're made of metal
but you have feelings.


679
00:53:59.848 --> 00:54:01.896
And you think about things.

680
00:54:02.059 --> 00:54:05.108
And that means you have a soul.

681
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:08.023
And souls don't die.

682
00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:10.067
Soul?

683
00:54:10.234 --> 00:54:14.239
Mom says it's something inside
of all good things,


684
00:54:14.404 --> 00:54:17.032
and that it goes on forever and ever.

685
00:54:31.755 --> 00:54:35.259
Souls don't die.

686
00:54:48.313 --> 00:54:50.281
You're very kind. 
Thank you so much.

687
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:55.120
You ever seen a better picture than that?
Look at those details.


688
00:54:55.279 --> 00:54:58.954
This is the famous 60 second
Polaroid land camera.


689
00:54:59.324 --> 00:55:00.450
Seeing the results on the spot...

690
00:55:08.458 --> 00:55:09.675
In 60 seconds...

691
00:55:11.461 --> 00:55:13.936
You know, if you...

692
00:55:16.091 --> 00:55:17.638
Don't you remember anything?

693
00:55:25.684 --> 00:55:27.937
You saw me save you.

694
00:55:29.187 --> 00:55:31.906
You came from the sky, right?

695
00:55:35.986 --> 00:55:38.330
You don't even know where "he" came from.

696
00:55:38.488 --> 00:55:41.332
Or what the hell "he" is!

697
00:55:48.165 --> 00:55:50.167
Guess you're not gonna hurt me.

698
00:56:13.023 --> 00:56:15.250
You're late for dinner, Hogarth.

699
00:56:17.694 --> 00:56:19.992
Your mom's working late tonight, Hogarth.

700
00:56:20.322 --> 00:56:21.619
So it's just us guys.

701
00:56:21.782 --> 00:56:24.535
And we're gonna have a little chat.
Sit down!


702
00:56:26.036 --> 00:56:29.666
How's that? A little too bright? Good.

703
00:56:31.625 --> 00:56:35.004
Forgive me, Hogarth.
I wanted you to learn something.


704
00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:36.888
What can I learn from you?

705
00:56:37.047 --> 00:56:38.219
You can learn this, Hogarth.

706
00:56:38.382 --> 00:56:40.555
That I can do anything I want,
whenever I want,


707
00:56:40.717 --> 00:56:43.015
if I feel it's in
the people's best interest.


708
00:56:43.178 --> 00:56:45.306
The giant metal man, where is it?

709
00:56:45.472 --> 00:56:48.066
I don't know what you're talking about.

710
00:56:48.225 --> 00:56:50.068
You don't? Well.

711
00:56:51.728 --> 00:56:53.651
Does this ring a bell?

712
00:56:54.481 --> 00:56:55.698
No?

713
00:56:55.857 --> 00:56:57.234
How about this?

714
00:56:58.527 --> 00:57:00.404
You've been careless, Hogarth.

715
00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:01.913
It doesn't prove anything.

716
00:57:02.072 --> 00:57:04.666
It's enough to get the Army here
with one phone call.


717
00:57:04.825 --> 00:57:07.749
- Then what's stopping you?
- Where's the giant?


718
00:57:07.911 --> 00:57:10.209
You can't protect him, Hogarth,

719
00:57:10.372 --> 00:57:13.751
any more than you can protect your mother.

720
00:57:13.917 --> 00:57:15.089
My mom?

721
00:57:15.252 --> 00:57:17.721
Ah, it's difficult
to raise a boy all alone.


722
00:57:17.879 --> 00:57:19.256
We can make it more difficult.

723
00:57:19.423 --> 00:57:21.425
In fact, we can make it so difficult

724
00:57:21.591 --> 00:57:24.765
that it would be irresponsible
for us to leave you in her care


725
00:57:24.928 --> 00:57:26.896
and all that that implies.

726
00:57:27.055 --> 00:57:29.774
- You'll be taken away from her, Hogarth.
- You can't do that!


727
00:57:29.933 --> 00:57:32.561
Oh, we can. And we will.

728
00:57:36.606 --> 00:57:38.700
He's in the junkyard.

729
00:57:38.859 --> 00:57:41.112
McCoppin's Scrap, off Culver Road.

730
00:57:41.278 --> 00:57:45.784
The junkyard. Of course!
Food for the metal-eater.


731
00:57:46.116 --> 00:57:49.962
I wouldn't worry about this, Hogarth.
It isn't really happening.


732
00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:52.418
This is only a bad dream.

733
00:57:56.293 --> 00:57:59.797
Where's the giant?

734
00:57:59.963 --> 00:58:02.807
This is only a bad dream.

735
00:58:02.966 --> 00:58:04.309
Yes, sir.

736
00:58:04.468 --> 00:58:05.890
This thing is real, sir.

737
00:58:06.053 --> 00:58:08.932
I not only have incontrovertible
evidence, General,


738
00:58:09.097 --> 00:58:10.815
I know where it's hidden.

739
00:58:10.974 --> 00:58:12.317
I don't know who
built it, but it's here.

740
00:58:12.476 --> 00:58:15.070
It's massive
and we're running out of time.


741
00:58:15.228 --> 00:58:17.981
There's no doubt we should act.
The only question, sir, is...


742
00:58:18.148 --> 00:58:20.492
Can you afford not to?

743
00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:24.655
Excellent, sir. You won't regret it.
Thank you, sir.


744
00:58:35.332 --> 00:58:39.132
The Army arrives in the morning, Hogarth.
Don't get cute.


745
00:58:44.508 --> 00:58:46.010
I gotta warn Dean.

746
00:58:56.937 --> 00:58:59.360
I'll be watching you.

747
01:00:17.434 --> 01:00:18.686
Morning, Kent.

748
01:00:26.943 --> 01:00:31.449
For some reason, the Army
is in our front yard, Mr. Mansley.


749
01:00:31.615 --> 01:00:33.743
Please, call me Kent.

750
01:00:41.291 --> 01:00:43.589
Okay.

751
01:00:59.768 --> 01:01:01.987
- All right, where is it?
- What?


752
01:01:02.145 --> 01:01:04.113
You know darn well what. The monster.

753
01:01:04.272 --> 01:01:07.446
The giant thing. 
The metal man.

754
01:01:08.735 --> 01:01:13.616
Ah, the metal man. Jeez, you were
scaring me there for a second.


755
01:01:13.782 --> 01:01:16.831
I thought I was under attack or something.

756
01:01:16.993 --> 01:01:18.245
He's in the back.

757
01:01:18.411 --> 01:01:20.334
Come on. I'll show you.

758
01:01:25.835 --> 01:01:28.008
You guys got here just in time.

759
01:01:28.171 --> 01:01:30.970
This rich cat,
you know, some industrialist,


760
01:01:31.132 --> 01:01:33.430
wants him for the lobby of his company.

761
01:01:33.593 --> 01:01:35.516
He whipped out his checkbook on the spot.

762
01:01:35.679 --> 01:01:39.024
I said, "Hey, you got him
for the rest of your life.


763
01:01:39.182 --> 01:01:43.278
"But, what, I gotta let go the moment
I give birth? I mean, come on.


764
01:01:43.436 --> 01:01:45.689
"Give me some time
to cut the umbilical, man."


765
01:01:47.107 --> 01:01:48.609
Here he is.

766
01:01:54.948 --> 01:01:56.291
Anyway, I haven't sold him yet.

767
01:01:56.449 --> 01:02:00.875
So if you really want him and if,
you know, you throw in


768
01:02:01.037 --> 01:02:03.210
a competitive bid...

769
01:02:03.373 --> 01:02:05.125
Sir, I... Listen... 
Sir, listen...

770
01:02:05.292 --> 01:02:07.545
- Step outside, Mansley.
- Yes.


771
01:02:08.044 --> 01:02:10.888
You realize how much hardware
I brought out here?


772
01:02:11.047 --> 01:02:15.143
You just blew millions of Uncle Sam's
dollars out of your butt!


773
01:02:15.302 --> 01:02:18.055
I gotta admit, 
I'm relieved that

774
01:02:18.221 --> 01:02:20.565
this is what Hogarth was talking about.

775
01:02:20.724 --> 01:02:24.524
I mean, I was beginning to, um,
think it was real.


776
01:02:25.785 --> 01:02:27.906
I mean, don't get
me wrong, I like it.

777
01:02:28.064 --> 01:02:30.908
But, uh, do you need all this stuff
on the surface?


778
01:02:31.067 --> 01:02:34.571
Well, um, no, actually.

779
01:02:34.738 --> 01:02:37.742
It just sort of...
It seems kind of slapped on.


780
01:02:37.907 --> 01:02:40.205
You know, not as thought-out
as this other piece.


781
01:02:40.368 --> 01:02:43.087
- You like that one?
- Yeah.


782
01:02:44.706 --> 01:02:46.708
You'll be chief inspector
of subway toilets


783
01:02:46.875 --> 01:02:48.593
by the time I'm finished with you!

784
01:02:48.752 --> 01:02:53.098
Now, pack up. I'll expect you back
in Washington to clear out your office.


785
01:02:53.256 --> 01:02:54.553
Yes, sir.

786
01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:59.729
Hmm. I see why Hogarth sneaks out here.

787
01:02:59.888 --> 01:03:02.107
You mean, you know about that?

788
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:04.233
Aw. Now I do.

789
01:03:18.406 --> 01:03:22.127
Bye, Kent, and all that that implies.

790
01:03:22.285 --> 01:03:23.878
Okay, you can move now.

791
01:03:25.455 --> 01:03:26.798
Nice job!

792
01:03:32.128 --> 01:03:33.801
Thruster to base.

793
01:03:33.963 --> 01:03:35.636
I'm goin' in.

794
01:03:35.799 --> 01:03:38.803
Only one creature could create
so much destruction.


795
01:03:38.968 --> 01:03:40.766
The hideous, people-eating,

796
01:03:40.929 --> 01:03:44.274
killing machine, Atomo!

797
01:03:45.767 --> 01:03:47.644
Atomo?

798
01:03:47.811 --> 01:03:49.813
No Atomo.

799
01:03:58.238 --> 01:04:00.161
I Superman.

800
01:04:00.323 --> 01:04:02.417
Okay, Superman.

801
01:04:02.575 --> 01:04:03.827
Take this!

802
01:04:07.831 --> 01:04:09.174
Stupid gun.

803
01:04:22.137 --> 01:04:23.810
Hey. What's wrong?

804
01:04:26.474 --> 01:04:28.977
As I was saying, take this!

805
01:04:32.647 --> 01:04:34.024
Oh!

806
01:04:35.191 --> 01:04:36.363
What happened? 
What was that...

807
01:04:36.526 --> 01:04:38.949
Shh. Stay down and follow me.

808
01:04:43.158 --> 01:04:44.535
Shh.

809
01:04:45.535 --> 01:04:46.878
Get back!

810
01:04:49.706 --> 01:04:52.050
I said, get back! I mean it!

811
01:04:52.876 --> 01:04:54.878
No, stop. Why?

812
01:04:55.044 --> 01:04:57.217
It was an accident. 
He's our friend.

813
01:04:57.380 --> 01:05:01.180
He's a piece of hardware, Hogarth.
Why do you think the Army was here?


814
01:05:01.342 --> 01:05:04.812
He's a weapon! 
A big gun that walks!

815
01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:08.392
I, I...

816
01:05:08.558 --> 01:05:10.060
I not gun.

817
01:05:10.226 --> 01:05:12.069
Yeah, what's that, huh?

818
01:05:12.562 --> 01:05:15.236
You almost did that to Hogarth!

819
01:05:16.399 --> 01:05:17.742
No.

820
01:05:21.321 --> 01:05:22.743
- Come back!
- Hogarth.


821
01:05:22.906 --> 01:05:24.533
- Hey, stop!
- Giant!


822
01:05:24.699 --> 01:05:26.201
Come back!

823
01:05:30.497 --> 01:05:32.090
It was defensive.

824
01:05:32.248 --> 01:05:34.501
He reacted to the gun.

825
01:05:37.712 --> 01:05:39.931
You're not gonna
get there fast enough on foot.


826
01:05:59.776 --> 01:06:02.279
See, I told you
it was a big hoax.

827
01:06:02.445 --> 01:06:04.072
- Dad said...
- Give me the binoculars.


828
01:06:04.239 --> 01:06:06.708
- What? What?
- Hey, there it is. I see it!


829
01:06:07.784 --> 01:06:09.707
It's big. It's walking away.

830
01:06:09.869 --> 01:06:12.042
- Hey. Gimme those.
- Over there. See it?


831
01:06:12.205 --> 01:06:13.627
The monster! Holy cow!

832
01:06:15.291 --> 01:06:16.463
Watch it!

833
01:06:16.626 --> 01:06:17.969
Help!

834
01:06:18.127 --> 01:06:19.970
Somebody help me!

835
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:22.132
- I don't wanna fall!
- Help!


836
01:06:24.425 --> 01:06:25.551
I'm slipping!

837
01:06:25.718 --> 01:06:27.971
I can't hold on much longer!

838
01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:38.482
- Dad!
- Daddy!


839
01:06:40.984 --> 01:06:43.612
- He saved those boys!
- It's friendly!


840
01:06:59.126 --> 01:07:00.254
What...

841
01:07:03.006 --> 01:07:04.303
Oh!

842
01:07:06.009 --> 01:07:07.181
Stop! Look!

843
01:07:07.343 --> 01:07:09.846
Look behind you!
The giant, it's attacking!


844
01:07:10.013 --> 01:07:11.811
It's stomping the town! I was right!

845
01:07:11.973 --> 01:07:14.977
- Sweet mother of God.
- Look, damn you!


846
01:07:22.692 --> 01:07:25.866
I am not a gun.

847
01:07:33.953 --> 01:07:35.830
Hey, Mom.

848
01:07:49.385 --> 01:07:50.637
Let's get out of here!

849
01:07:50.803 --> 01:07:51.975
Run!

850
01:08:03.316 --> 01:08:05.865
Hey. Stop! There's a kid in his hands!

851
01:08:06.027 --> 01:08:07.404
Stop shooting!

852
01:08:08.404 --> 01:08:10.702
Kent! He only reacts defensively.

853
01:08:10.865 --> 01:08:14.085
If you don't shoot, he's harmless.
You gotta tell the General!


854
01:08:14.243 --> 01:08:16.371
This is all your fault, beatnik.
If you hadn't...


855
01:08:16.537 --> 01:08:17.709
Would you shut up and listen?

856
01:08:17.872 --> 01:08:21.217
You've gotta make them stop.
The giant's got the kid with him.


857
01:08:22.251 --> 01:08:23.423
I'll take care of it.

858
01:08:28.883 --> 01:08:33.354
He says the monster's killed a kid.
Sir, we must stop it at all costs.


859
01:08:33.513 --> 01:08:35.936
Go to code red. 
Repeat, code red!

860
01:08:37.392 --> 01:08:40.066
Mr. President, we have a situation, sir.

861
01:08:46.401 --> 01:08:48.699
Watch it, lady!

862
01:09:01.082 --> 01:09:03.210
Look out for the bus!

863
01:09:17.473 --> 01:09:18.975
You can fly?

864
01:09:20.935 --> 01:09:22.733
You can fly!

865
01:09:28.651 --> 01:09:29.994
Hogarth!

866
01:09:31.446 --> 01:09:34.620
Try pointing your arms straight ahead,
like Superman!


867
01:09:52.967 --> 01:09:54.594
No, no!

868
01:10:01.267 --> 01:10:03.611
I've lost visual. 
Repeat, lost visual!

869
01:10:08.524 --> 01:10:10.697
Man, that was close!

870
01:10:13.946 --> 01:10:15.198
No!

871
01:10:17.283 --> 01:10:19.331
Ha. Gotcha!

872
01:10:36.969 --> 01:10:38.892
Good call, Mansley.

873
01:10:39.055 --> 01:10:43.731
Secure the area. Let's find out
what this thing is and who sent it.


874
01:10:50.525 --> 01:10:51.651
Huh?

875
01:11:06.707 --> 01:11:08.550
Halt! Set your perimeter!

876
01:11:09.836 --> 01:11:12.259
- It's still alive!
- Shoot at it!


877
01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:36.947
Retreat! Retreat!

878
01:11:38.865 --> 01:11:40.583
Let's get out of here!

879
01:11:50.418 --> 01:11:52.045
Hogarth!

880
01:11:53.462 --> 01:11:56.432
He's unconscious, but he's okay.
Let's get him in the car.


881
01:11:56.799 --> 01:11:59.598
Drive, baby, drive! Step on it! Floor it!

882
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:03.310
It's gaining on us. Faster! Faster! Hurry!

883
01:12:13.274 --> 01:12:15.117
All battleships fire at the robot!

884
01:12:15.276 --> 01:12:16.448
Now!

885
01:12:16.611 --> 01:12:18.238
Now, damn it, now!

886
01:12:26.495 --> 01:12:29.465
Nothing can stop this thing!
We've hit it with everything we've got!


887
01:12:29.624 --> 01:12:31.592
Not everything, General. The bomb.

888
01:12:33.294 --> 01:12:35.968
The Nautilus has first strike capability
and is not far offshore.


889
01:12:36.964 --> 01:12:38.261
You scare me, Mansley.

890
01:12:38.424 --> 01:12:41.177
You want us to bomb ourselves
in order to kill it?


891
01:12:41.344 --> 01:12:43.688
General, the giant seems to follow
whatever attacks it.


892
01:12:43.846 --> 01:12:46.599
We can lure it away from the town,
then destroy it.


893
01:12:48.351 --> 01:12:51.981
Radio the Nautilus. Tell them to target
the robot and await my command.


894
01:12:53.773 --> 01:12:56.196
This is Nautilus.
What is the giant's current position?


895
01:12:56.359 --> 01:12:59.033
67. 71972 degrees west,

896
01:12:59.195 --> 01:13:02.199
by 44.50177 degrees north.

897
01:13:02.365 --> 01:13:03.491
Locked and loaded.

898
01:13:03.699 --> 01:13:05.372
Oh, my baby, I'm so sorry.

899
01:13:05.534 --> 01:13:07.832
- Stop the car.
- Hogarth! My God, honey, you're all right.


900
01:13:07.995 --> 01:13:09.542
Go back! We've gotta help him!

901
01:13:09.705 --> 01:13:12.003
Are you crazy, kid?
You're lucky to be alive!


902
01:13:12.166 --> 01:13:13.713
We're taking you to a hospital.

903
01:13:19.715 --> 01:13:21.717
Everyone! Out of the car!
We're evacuating the area.


904
01:13:21.884 --> 01:13:23.978
What are you talking about?
We gotta get this boy to a hospital.


905
01:13:24.136 --> 01:13:25.308
What boy?

906
01:13:25.972 --> 01:13:27.189
Hogarth!

907
01:13:31.018 --> 01:13:32.361
Hogarth, no!

908
01:13:42.571 --> 01:13:45.074
Hey! No! Stop!

909
01:13:56.377 --> 01:13:57.674
This is General Rogard.

910
01:13:57.837 --> 01:14:00.431
Ready the attack and prepare
to retreat to the fallback position.


911
01:14:00.589 --> 01:14:04.093
No! No! Stop! My son is out there!

912
01:14:06.679 --> 01:14:10.104
No, wait. It's me, Hogarth. Remember?

913
01:14:10.766 --> 01:14:14.737
It's bad to kill. Guns kill.

914
01:14:14.895 --> 01:14:17.239
And you don't have to be a gun.

915
01:14:17.690 --> 01:14:20.239
You are what you choose to be.

916
01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:22.828
You choose.

917
01:14:23.738 --> 01:14:25.081
Choose.

918
01:14:26.323 --> 01:14:28.496
Hogarth.

919
01:14:36.292 --> 01:14:37.794
It's okay. It's okay.

920
01:14:38.169 --> 01:14:40.263
We gotta show them you're good.

921
01:14:44.258 --> 01:14:46.260
Nautilus to Rogard,
missile armed and ready.


922
01:14:46.427 --> 01:14:48.054
What are you saying, he's friendly?

923
01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:50.769
Yes. Attacking him is triggering
a defense mechanism.


924
01:14:50.931 --> 01:14:53.684
Don't listen, General! Destroy the monster
while we still have the chance!


925
01:14:56.145 --> 01:14:58.443
General, you shoot and the whole thing
starts all over again.


926
01:14:58.606 --> 01:15:01.200
- Stop it now! Our future's at stake!
- Orders, sir?


927
01:15:01.358 --> 01:15:03.452
Which is why you have
got to stop, General!


928
01:15:03.611 --> 01:15:06.865
- It's getting closer! Orders, sir?
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!


929
01:15:07.031 --> 01:15:09.625
- Hogarth!
- Hold your fire! The boy's alive?


930
01:15:09.784 --> 01:15:11.036
It's a trick! Launch the missile.

931
01:15:11.202 --> 01:15:13.079
Are you mad, Mansley?

932
01:15:13.245 --> 01:15:14.872
All units, stand down!

933
01:15:15.039 --> 01:15:17.087
Rogard to Nautilus. Come in, Nautilus.

934
01:15:17.249 --> 01:15:19.047
This is Nautilus standing by.

935
01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:20.462
Launch the missile now!

936
01:15:28.302 --> 01:15:31.181
That missile is targeted
to the giant's current position!


937
01:15:31.639 --> 01:15:33.391
Where's the giant, Mansley?

938
01:15:33.974 --> 01:15:37.569
What... Oh...

939
01:15:37.728 --> 01:15:40.151
We can duck and cover.
There's a fallout shelter right there.


940
01:15:40.314 --> 01:15:42.988
There's no way to survive this, you idiot!

941
01:15:43.150 --> 01:15:45.027
You mean, we're all going to...

942
01:15:45.194 --> 01:15:48.573
To die, Mansley, for our country.

943
01:15:49.657 --> 01:15:52.752
Screw our country! 
I want to live!

944
01:15:58.207 --> 01:15:59.333
Hold him, men.

945
01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.720
Make sure he stays here,
like a good soldier.


946
01:16:06.674 --> 01:16:07.846
Oh!

947
01:16:12.003 --> 01:16:13.752
Oh, no.

948
01:16:16.225 --> 01:16:18.569
- Hmm?
- It's a missile.


949
01:16:18.727 --> 01:16:23.107
When it comes down everyone will die.

950
01:16:23.274 --> 01:16:24.651
There it is!

951
01:16:40.833 --> 01:16:43.757
- Shouldn't we get to a shelter?
- It wouldn't matter.


952
01:16:44.378 --> 01:16:46.551
I fix.

953
01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:54.517
Giant?

954
01:16:58.684 --> 01:17:00.231
Hogarth.

955
01:17:01.353 --> 01:17:03.981
You stay.

956
01:17:04.899 --> 01:17:07.618
I go.

957
01:17:12.573 --> 01:17:16.123
No following.

958
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:27.012
I love you.

959
01:17:55.491 --> 01:17:57.368
You are who you choose to be.

960
01:18:00.329 --> 01:18:02.707
Superman.

961
01:18:34.655 --> 01:18:36.123
Let's go home.

962
01:19:23.037 --> 01:19:26.166
Your best work yet, honey.
No doubt about it.


963
01:19:26.332 --> 01:19:28.710
You think this is my best? Really?

964
01:19:28.876 --> 01:19:32.676
Well, you know,
next to that bug, uh, thing.


965
01:19:32.838 --> 01:19:36.383
You know, the one with the, uh, shovels...

966
01:19:36.742 --> 01:19:40.313
Um, Hogarth? Come on, honey. Time to go.

967
01:19:40.471 --> 01:19:43.224
- See you later, guys.
- See you later, Hogarth.


968
01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:45.813
Oh, hey, Hogarth, um,
the General sent this to you.


969
01:19:45.976 --> 01:19:47.193
What is it?

970
01:19:47.353 --> 01:19:49.731
He said it was the only part recovered.

971
01:19:50.147 --> 01:19:52.195
He thought you should have it.

972
01:19:54.151 --> 01:19:55.744
I miss him.

973
01:20:44.952 --> 01:20:46.420
See you later!
