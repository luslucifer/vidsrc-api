1
00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.454
Sorry, I'm actually
gonna grab that one. Thanks.


2
00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:14.649
Coming through.

3
00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:15.692
Hey, guys.

4
00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.404
Hey. Has anyone seen Carley?

5
00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:23.449
Hey, Merry Christmas, Debra.

6
00:00:30.164 --> 00:00:32.834
Guess who's your secret Santa.

7
00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:34.377
Again?

8
00:00:34.419 --> 00:00:35.461
Three years in a row.

9
00:00:35.503 --> 00:00:36.504
What are the odds?

10
00:00:39.507 --> 00:00:41.718
Right. Okay.
Open it.


11
00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:48.057
You know me so well.

12
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.227
Can never have too
many vessels for tea.


13
00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:52.520
You do say that.

14
00:00:52.562 --> 00:00:53.688
Yeah.

15
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.815
Just gonna put that up there.

16
00:00:57.775 --> 00:00:59.152
Thank you, Greg.

17
00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:02.238
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Greg.


18
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.990
Ms. Kincaid, can
I have word with you


19
00:01:04.032 --> 00:01:06.200
in the conference room?

20
00:01:06.242 --> 00:01:07.952
Of course. Absolutely.

21
00:01:11.664 --> 00:01:15.084
So I'm sure you're anxious
to start your holiday,


22
00:01:15.126 --> 00:01:16.628
so I'll make this quick.

23
00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:18.338
As you know, Robert
Lawrence is retiring.


24
00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:19.756
Yes, sir.

25
00:01:19.797 --> 00:01:21.215
Which leaves us with an opening

26
00:01:21.257 --> 00:01:22.592
for Director of Quality Control.

27
00:01:22.634 --> 00:01:24.802
I understand you two
work well together.


28
00:01:24.844 --> 00:01:26.054
Yes, sir. We did.

29
00:01:26.095 --> 00:01:27.323
He taught me
everything that I know.


30
00:01:27.347 --> 00:01:28.640
That's what I wanted to hear.

31
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:30.558
We're filling his
position today,


32
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.311
and I will be relying
on your experience


33
00:01:33.353 --> 00:01:34.354
in the months ahead.

34
00:01:34.395 --> 00:01:35.521
I won't let you down.

35
00:01:35.563 --> 00:01:36.723
As you train his replacement.

36
00:01:38.942 --> 00:01:40.652
Sorry. His what?

37
00:01:41.444 --> 00:01:43.613
Ah, here we go.

38
00:01:43.655 --> 00:01:46.491
Carley Kincaid,
meet Wyatt Redmond,


39
00:01:46.532 --> 00:01:49.577
my son and our new Director
of Quality Control.


40
00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.536
Hey.

41
00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:52.163
Kincaid, I look forward

42
00:01:52.205 --> 00:01:54.916
to controlling the
quality with you.


43
00:02:03.424 --> 00:02:04.842
And then that was it.

44
00:02:04.884 --> 00:02:06.644
They wished me happy
holiday, so I just left.


45
00:02:06.678 --> 00:02:08.221
Wow. I'm sorry, Carl.

46
00:02:08.263 --> 00:02:09.764
That's so unfair.

47
00:02:09.806 --> 00:02:11.224
I know.

48
00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:12.701
Jamie, this guy, he
has no experience.


49
00:02:12.725 --> 00:02:14.394
He knows nothing
about the company.


50
00:02:14.435 --> 00:02:16.229
He is my boss.

51
00:02:16.271 --> 00:02:17.438
My boss.

52
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:19.917
It sounds like you
need one of these.


53
00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:21.776
That would be
great. Thank you.


54
00:02:21.818 --> 00:02:23.420
I'm surprised you wanted
the promotion at all.


55
00:02:23.444 --> 00:02:24.630
I mean, that place
is a soulless vacuum


56
00:02:24.654 --> 00:02:26.072
where all fashion goes to die.

57
00:02:26.114 --> 00:02:27.240
Who said that?

58
00:02:27.282 --> 00:02:29.409
You did multiple times.

59
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.910
Well, yeah. Okay.

60
00:02:30.952 --> 00:02:32.221
But people complain
about their jobs, Jamie.


61
00:02:32.245 --> 00:02:33.413
I don't.

62
00:02:33.454 --> 00:02:34.664
Because you are a sommelier.

63
00:02:34.706 --> 00:02:37.500
You drink wine for a living.

64
00:02:37.542 --> 00:02:38.876
Okay, fair. Fair point.

65
00:02:38.918 --> 00:02:41.421
Most people, work is for money.

66
00:02:41.462 --> 00:02:43.047
Hobbies are for fun.

67
00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:44.924
Your sketches are not a hobby.

68
00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:47.635
You should be working on
fashion shows and red carpets,


69
00:02:47.677 --> 00:02:50.096
not pushing out generic T-shirts

70
00:02:50.138 --> 00:02:52.640
for corporate merchandising.

71
00:02:54.017 --> 00:02:55.435
I love you.

72
00:02:55.476 --> 00:02:56.537
I can't believe
you're leaving me.


73
00:02:56.561 --> 00:02:58.438
So realistically speaking,

74
00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:59.873
what does Italy have that
New York doesn't have?


75
00:02:59.897 --> 00:03:02.191
The Colosseum, the
Venice canals and,


76
00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:04.777
oh, the best wineries and
vineyards in the entire world.


77
00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.488
Right. So essentially
what I'm hearing is nothing.


78
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.489
I'm gonna miss you.

79
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:09.741
Me too.

80
00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:13.077
Look, I know that people
have left you before,


81
00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:16.456
but you know that this
is different, right?


82
00:03:16.497 --> 00:03:17.641
Jaim, of course
this is different.


83
00:03:17.665 --> 00:03:19.042
I'm not eight years old anymore.

84
00:03:19.083 --> 00:03:20.793
Look, you gotta go.

85
00:03:20.835 --> 00:03:22.605
You gotta go be the best
sommelier in the whole world.


86
00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:23.981
And I want you to live
your life to the fullest.


87
00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:26.591
And that's exactly
what I want for you.


88
00:03:26.633 --> 00:03:27.901
I'm fine. Don't
worry about me.


89
00:03:29.052 --> 00:03:30.219
I want you to promise me

90
00:03:30.261 --> 00:03:31.596
that you're gonna make a change.

91
00:03:31.638 --> 00:03:32.889
Yeah, I'll make a change.

92
00:03:32.931 --> 00:03:34.140
No, no, no.

93
00:03:34.182 --> 00:03:35.934
Promise me

94
00:03:35.975 --> 00:03:37.328
or else I'm literally not
taking my flight tomorrow.


95
00:03:37.352 --> 00:03:39.312
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

96
00:03:39.354 --> 00:03:40.480
I'll make a change.

97
00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:42.357
I will quit my boring job.

98
00:03:42.398 --> 00:03:44.442
I will make some new friends.

99
00:03:44.484 --> 00:03:45.777
I will follow my dreams, okay?

100
00:03:45.818 --> 00:03:47.904
And you'll say yes to adventure?

101
00:03:47.946 --> 00:03:49.030
Sure.

102
00:03:49.072 --> 00:03:50.740
You should make a list.

103
00:03:50.782 --> 00:03:52.009
We will call it the
resolutions for the new year.


104
00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:53.034
Hmm?

105
00:03:54.702 --> 00:03:55.703
Promise?

106
00:03:58.247 --> 00:03:59.582
I promise.

107
00:05:00.226 --> 00:05:01.269
Sh!

108
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:07.317
You are professional.

109
00:05:07.358 --> 00:05:09.986
You are accomplished, patient.

110
00:05:12.447 --> 00:05:15.241
You will not yell at
this silly man today.


111
00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:25.752
Oh, Millie. This
batch smells so good.


112
00:05:25.793 --> 00:05:27.587
Frankincense and peppermint.

113
00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:28.796
Perfect for Christmas,

114
00:05:28.838 --> 00:05:30.590
and for curing headaches.

115
00:05:30.632 --> 00:05:32.508
If I give one to my
boss, will he disappear?


116
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.469
Sweetheart, there
are some things,


117
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.429
even essential oils can't do.

118
00:05:36.471 --> 00:05:37.764
Sacrilege.

119
00:05:40.475 --> 00:05:41.935
Merry Christmas.

120
00:05:41.976 --> 00:05:42.936
Merry Christmas.

121
00:05:42.977 --> 00:05:43.770
Merry Christmas.

122
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:44.729
Merry Christmas, Hank.

123
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:46.105
- Hey.
- Hey.


124
00:05:47.565 --> 00:05:48.691
Ho, ho ho.

125
00:05:48.733 --> 00:05:50.443
Merry Christmas.

126
00:05:55.281 --> 00:05:57.158
Greg, Greg?

127
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.660
Have you seen Wyatt today?

128
00:06:00.328 --> 00:06:01.663
Where is he?

129
00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:08.670
Mr. Wyatt,
you're going to be late!


130
00:06:09.754 --> 00:06:11.673
Come on, sleepy head.

131
00:06:19.681 --> 00:06:21.724
Nice work, Vincent.

132
00:06:23.935 --> 00:06:25.687
Isn't that a bit much, Gertie?

133
00:06:25.728 --> 00:06:29.274
Perhaps, but I'm
in a festive mood.


134
00:06:29.315 --> 00:06:30.400
I can tell.

135
00:06:31.734 --> 00:06:33.486
Is there any bacon?

136
00:06:38.616 --> 00:06:40.410
Good morning, Charlie.

137
00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:46.874
Buongiorno, amigo.

138
00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:49.019
Somebody's accent's
getting good.


139
00:06:49.043 --> 00:06:50.545
Why thank you.

140
00:06:50.586 --> 00:06:52.022
But I just wanted to
tell you the big news,


141
00:06:52.046 --> 00:06:54.674
I am gonna be flying
back for the holidays.


142
00:06:54.716 --> 00:06:57.385
Oh, I thought you
were staying in Sicily.


143
00:06:57.427 --> 00:06:58.845
Well, plans have changed.

144
00:06:58.886 --> 00:07:00.805
And to quote the
man of my dreams,


145
00:07:00.847 --> 00:07:03.141
"I will be home for Christmas."

146
00:07:03.182 --> 00:07:05.184
The man of your
dreams is Bing Crosby?


147
00:07:05.226 --> 00:07:07.895
Jonathan Taylor
Thomas, obviously.


148
00:07:07.937 --> 00:07:09.105
Huh?

149
00:07:09.147 --> 00:07:10.523
We have so much to catch up on.

150
00:07:10.565 --> 00:07:11.899
How's your list going?

151
00:07:11.941 --> 00:07:13.901
How many resolutions
do you have left?


152
00:07:13.943 --> 00:07:16.143
I cannot wait to hear about
all the changes you've made.


153
00:07:20.617 --> 00:07:22.827
Hello? Earth to Carley.

154
00:07:24.829 --> 00:07:26.539
Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:07:26.581 --> 00:07:30.126
No, I've made some
big giant changes.


156
00:07:30.168 --> 00:07:31.544
Lots of them.

157
00:07:31.586 --> 00:07:34.172
We're gonna have a
lot to talk about when


158
00:07:34.213 --> 00:07:35.548
you're here.

159
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.674
Jamie, I gotta go.

160
00:07:36.716 --> 00:07:37.842
Okay.

161
00:07:39.636 --> 00:07:42.764
And a bonne Nutella to you too.

162
00:07:47.852 --> 00:07:49.079
Good morning. How nice
of you to join us.


163
00:07:49.103 --> 00:07:50.313
Overslept.

164
00:07:50.355 --> 00:07:51.147
So you're well-rested?

165
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:52.732
Hardly.

166
00:07:52.774 --> 00:07:54.293
Friends and I went to
a secret train platform


167
00:07:54.317 --> 00:07:56.211
in Grand Central for a
Clevermore hip-hop concert,


168
00:07:56.235 --> 00:07:58.213
that somehow turned into
an all-night scavenger hunt


169
00:07:58.237 --> 00:07:59.072
across the city.

170
00:07:59.113 --> 00:08:00.531
Good morning.

171
00:08:00.573 --> 00:08:02.009
Your social life
sounds exhausting.


172
00:08:02.033 --> 00:08:03.344
Well, there are
those who live to work


173
00:08:03.368 --> 00:08:04.661
and those who work to live.

174
00:08:04.702 --> 00:08:06.079
And those who
hardly work at all.


175
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.431
Sounds like someone
needs a cookie.


176
00:08:07.455 --> 00:08:08.873
No, what I need is for you

177
00:08:08.915 --> 00:08:10.476
to start helping me with
these annual reports


178
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.518
'cause your dad really hates
when they come in late.


179
00:08:11.542 --> 00:08:13.336
Right. Cool.

180
00:08:13.378 --> 00:08:14.980
Could you do that and then
I'll just sign off on it?


181
00:08:15.004 --> 00:08:16.690
No, 'cause that is not
the thing that I said.


182
00:08:16.714 --> 00:08:17.983
That is doing a group
project in high school


183
00:08:18.007 --> 00:08:19.926
with the prom king
where I do all the work


184
00:08:19.968 --> 00:08:21.445
and then you get praised for
being handsome and charming.


185
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:22.762
You think I'm handsome?

186
00:08:22.804 --> 00:08:23.972
It's not a compliment.

187
00:08:24.013 --> 00:08:25.723
Then you're bad at insults.

188
00:08:27.058 --> 00:08:29.018
Where are you going?

189
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.537
Look, I'd love to dive into
your juicy high school past,


190
00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:32.313
but I am late for
a lunch meeting.


191
00:08:32.355 --> 00:08:33.648
You just got here.

192
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.066
No rest for the weary, right?

193
00:08:35.108 --> 00:08:36.276
Wicked.

194
00:08:36.317 --> 00:08:37.277
Glad we agree.

195
00:08:37.318 --> 00:08:38.987
No, it's wicked.

196
00:08:39.028 --> 00:08:41.531
The phrase is no rest for
the wicked, obviously.


197
00:08:42.782 --> 00:08:43.950
Okay.

198
00:08:45.618 --> 00:08:46.828
Hey, thanks for lunch.

199
00:08:46.869 --> 00:08:48.329
Next one's on me.

200
00:08:48.371 --> 00:08:50.206
Nah, that's what the
company card's for.


201
00:08:50.248 --> 00:08:51.791
So how is working with your dad?

202
00:08:51.833 --> 00:08:53.793
You mean for my dad?

203
00:08:53.835 --> 00:08:55.003
Same old Silas.

204
00:08:55.044 --> 00:08:56.421
Wants to keep a close eye on me

205
00:08:56.462 --> 00:08:58.631
while somehow remaining
completely distant.


206
00:09:00.633 --> 00:09:03.678
I know the holidays
can be tough.


207
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.263
Kendra worries
about you, you know?


208
00:09:05.305 --> 00:09:07.056
We both do.

209
00:09:07.098 --> 00:09:10.226
How did you get such a
kind and thoughtful woman?


210
00:09:10.268 --> 00:09:12.520
Sheer dumb luck.

211
00:09:12.562 --> 00:09:14.272
And how's my girl Olivia?

212
00:09:14.314 --> 00:09:16.333
In kindergarten, but reading
at a first-grade level.


213
00:09:16.357 --> 00:09:17.942
Tell her I miss her.

214
00:09:17.984 --> 00:09:19.819
You could always
tell her yourself.


215
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:22.572
It's been a while since
she's seen her godfather.


216
00:09:22.614 --> 00:09:23.716
Why don't you come by the house?

217
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.158
No, I should.

218
00:09:25.199 --> 00:09:26.993
Sorry.

219
00:09:27.035 --> 00:09:29.037
Listen, if you ever need
a break from the office


220
00:09:29.078 --> 00:09:33.166
and all of this, you
always come stay with us.


221
00:09:33.207 --> 00:09:36.961
Maybe a change is
exactly what you need.


222
00:09:37.003 --> 00:09:38.671
Yeah, yeah.

223
00:09:38.713 --> 00:09:39.672
Happy holidays, my friend.

224
00:09:39.714 --> 00:09:40.840
Good seeing you, man.

225
00:09:47.597 --> 00:09:49.390
"Light candle for headache.

226
00:09:49.432 --> 00:09:50.558
Hot date tonight.

227
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.060
Don't wait up."

228
00:10:25.927 --> 00:10:27.720
Quit your boring job.

229
00:10:27.762 --> 00:10:29.764
Follow your dreams.

230
00:10:29.806 --> 00:10:31.683
Say yes to adventure.

231
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.060
Make a new friend.

232
00:10:36.479 --> 00:10:38.022
Nice try, kiddo.

233
00:10:47.323 --> 00:10:51.536
At least someone's
living life to the fullest.


234
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:55.999
Hello, this is Carley.

235
00:10:56.791 --> 00:10:58.001
What?

236
00:10:58.042 --> 00:10:59.210
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

237
00:10:59.252 --> 00:11:01.713
Mrs. Johnson, slow down please.

238
00:11:03.047 --> 00:11:06.050
I'm sorry, what's
wrong with your order?


239
00:11:07.969 --> 00:11:10.805
No, absolutely. We
definitely take it...


240
00:11:10.847 --> 00:11:12.015
Hello?

241
00:11:18.896 --> 00:11:19.856
Notice anything?

242
00:11:19.897 --> 00:11:21.566
Besides Blitzen?

243
00:11:22.567 --> 00:11:23.943
Wow.

244
00:11:23.985 --> 00:11:25.695
Why are you so strong?

245
00:11:25.737 --> 00:11:27.280
It's not me.

246
00:11:27.322 --> 00:11:28.531
It's the shirts.

247
00:11:28.573 --> 00:11:29.633
The stitching is all wrong.

248
00:11:29.657 --> 00:11:31.034
How'd that happen?

249
00:11:31.075 --> 00:11:32.511
The factory produces
these every year.


250
00:11:32.535 --> 00:11:34.329
No, I placed an order
with a new factory


251
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:35.931
because all of our regular
ones are at capacity.


252
00:11:35.955 --> 00:11:37.165
Oh, that's not good.

253
00:11:37.206 --> 00:11:38.833
It could have been fine.

254
00:11:38.875 --> 00:11:40.102
Did you read the
inspection report?


255
00:11:40.126 --> 00:11:41.711
No. They're incredibly boring.

256
00:11:41.753 --> 00:11:43.796
Your whole job is
reading inspection reports.


257
00:11:43.838 --> 00:11:46.132
You are in charge
of quality control.


258
00:11:46.174 --> 00:11:47.967
You control the quality.

259
00:11:48.009 --> 00:11:50.261
Is this really the time
to be pointing fingers?


260
00:11:50.303 --> 00:11:51.303
Yes.

261
00:11:51.846 --> 00:11:52.846
Yes.

262
00:11:54.015 --> 00:11:56.684
If I don't, somebody else will.

263
00:11:56.726 --> 00:11:59.604
Do you even know how much
money you just cost us?


264
00:11:59.646 --> 00:12:03.399
We needed this shipment to
fulfill our holiday orders.


265
00:12:03.441 --> 00:12:06.986
Please accept our
sincerest apologies, Allison.


266
00:12:07.028 --> 00:12:08.780
We'll give you a full refund.

267
00:12:08.821 --> 00:12:12.158
We've been in business a
long time together, Silas,


268
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.661
and never have I seen
such an amateur mistake.


269
00:12:14.702 --> 00:12:17.330
If Costmart is gonna
continue our partnership,


270
00:12:17.372 --> 00:12:20.750
I need to know who was
responsible for this.


271
00:12:23.586 --> 00:12:26.631
Well, a mistake like
this is usually not


272
00:12:26.673 --> 00:12:28.299
the fault of one person.

273
00:12:28.341 --> 00:12:30.301
Well, I can only assume
that quality control


274
00:12:30.343 --> 00:12:32.679
should take the
bulk of the blame.


275
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.097
That is my department.

276
00:12:34.138 --> 00:12:35.640
Yes, that's me.

277
00:12:36.891 --> 00:12:40.103
Well, then Silas,
what's it gonna be?


278
00:12:40.144 --> 00:12:41.980
Because if you don't
make a change, I will.


279
00:12:45.233 --> 00:12:48.695
I want you to promise me that
you're gonna make a change.


280
00:12:48.736 --> 00:12:50.071
I promise.

281
00:12:52.115 --> 00:12:53.700
It was my fault

282
00:12:53.741 --> 00:12:54.784
What?

283
00:12:54.826 --> 00:12:56.911
It is. It's my fault.

284
00:12:56.953 --> 00:12:58.746
We sent your order
to a new factory.


285
00:12:58.788 --> 00:12:59.872
They were untested.

286
00:12:59.914 --> 00:13:01.708
I didn't vet them properly.

287
00:13:01.749 --> 00:13:03.227
So there's really nothing
quality control could've done.


288
00:13:03.251 --> 00:13:04.919
I'm very sorry.

289
00:13:04.961 --> 00:13:06.045
I see.

290
00:13:06.087 --> 00:13:07.463
- Kincaid-
- Shh.


291
00:13:08.256 --> 00:13:09.173
Silas?

292
00:13:09.215 --> 00:13:10.591
Carley, you don't need to-

293
00:13:10.633 --> 00:13:12.510
- Oh, Mr. Redmond, please.

294
00:13:12.552 --> 00:13:14.679
I'm fine. It's okay.

295
00:13:14.721 --> 00:13:16.389
I'm holding myself accountable.

296
00:13:17.765 --> 00:13:20.602
Good. Let's move on.

297
00:13:27.942 --> 00:13:29.777
Hey, can we talk?

298
00:13:31.988 --> 00:13:34.741
I let go of a
good employee today.


299
00:13:34.782 --> 00:13:35.783
I know.

300
00:13:35.825 --> 00:13:37.577
You shouldn't have.

301
00:13:38.953 --> 00:13:41.372
Carley was your best employee.

302
00:13:41.414 --> 00:13:43.541
We both know this was my fault.

303
00:13:43.583 --> 00:13:45.668
You can actually be
good at this job, son.


304
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.629
If you just, for once,

305
00:13:49.047 --> 00:13:51.090
took something seriously.

306
00:13:51.132 --> 00:13:52.610
I always thought you
were serious enough


307
00:13:52.634 --> 00:13:54.886
for the both of us.

308
00:13:54.928 --> 00:13:57.388
Even now, it's
all a joke for you.


309
00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.350
I've tried to be a role
model for you, Wyatt.


310
00:14:00.391 --> 00:14:04.520
Showing you what hard work
and determination can achieve.


311
00:14:04.562 --> 00:14:06.773
Done my best to
set a good example


312
00:14:06.814 --> 00:14:08.274
without your mother.

313
00:14:08.316 --> 00:14:10.276
Well, maybe you should
have fired me instead.


314
00:14:10.318 --> 00:14:12.570
So you could do what exactly?

315
00:14:12.612 --> 00:14:15.531
Without the family money,
you'd be completely lost.


316
00:14:15.573 --> 00:14:17.134
I was wondering how
long it would take you


317
00:14:17.158 --> 00:14:18.993
to threaten me with
the trust fund.


318
00:14:19.035 --> 00:14:21.204
It's not a threat this time.

319
00:14:21.245 --> 00:14:23.539
As of now, you're cut off.

320
00:14:23.581 --> 00:14:26.042
No more trust fund,
no more credit cards,


321
00:14:26.084 --> 00:14:28.670
no more living life
in the lap of luxury


322
00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:33.007
until you can prove to me you
can take your job seriously.


323
00:14:33.049 --> 00:14:34.884
You have until the
end of the year


324
00:14:34.926 --> 00:14:37.762
or I'll turn the
tap off for good.


325
00:14:37.804 --> 00:14:39.097
Okay.

326
00:14:42.475 --> 00:14:45.895
Didn't think it was
gonna go that way.


327
00:14:50.275 --> 00:14:52.944
Merry Christmas to you too, Dad.

328
00:14:56.572 --> 00:14:58.324
I'm unemployed for the holidays.

329
00:14:58.366 --> 00:15:00.201
Do you think I'm crazy.

330
00:15:00.243 --> 00:15:02.453
Sweetheart, I
think this might be


331
00:15:02.495 --> 00:15:05.748
the sanest thing
you've ever done.


332
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.542
I'm very proud of you.

333
00:15:07.583 --> 00:15:09.335
Thanks.

334
00:15:09.377 --> 00:15:10.854
Now, I hate to leave you
in your moment of need,


335
00:15:10.878 --> 00:15:13.214
but I'm late for an event.

336
00:15:13.256 --> 00:15:14.608
You know it makes
me look really bad


337
00:15:14.632 --> 00:15:16.175
when my 70-year-old
roommate goes


338
00:15:16.217 --> 00:15:17.885
to more parties
than I do, right?


339
00:15:17.927 --> 00:15:19.071
Then perhaps you might
consider a few more life changes


340
00:15:19.095 --> 00:15:20.513
while you're on a roll.

341
00:15:20.555 --> 00:15:24.183
A little adventure might
be just what you need.


342
00:15:24.225 --> 00:15:25.476
I'll think about it.

343
00:15:33.401 --> 00:15:36.738
They didn't read
the quality reports.


344
00:15:41.326 --> 00:15:43.578
Hey, Millie, did
you forget your keys?


345
00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.537
Hey. Whoa.

346
00:15:44.579 --> 00:15:46.039
Hi.

347
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.433
You're not who I thought
you were gonna be.


348
00:15:47.457 --> 00:15:48.958
Yeah.

349
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.894
Kinda weird to see each
other in the real world, huh?


350
00:15:50.918 --> 00:15:52.962
Yes. One might even
say that it's disturbing.


351
00:15:53.004 --> 00:15:54.004
Yeah.

352
00:15:54.839 --> 00:15:56.299
Can I come in?

353
00:15:58.676 --> 00:15:59.719
Thank you.

354
00:16:09.812 --> 00:16:10.855
Hi.

355
00:16:10.897 --> 00:16:12.065
Nice PJs, by the way.

356
00:16:12.106 --> 00:16:13.566
What do you want, Wyatt?

357
00:16:13.608 --> 00:16:15.401
I wanna know why you
took the fall for me.


358
00:16:15.443 --> 00:16:17.195
We haven't exactly been pals.

359
00:16:17.236 --> 00:16:18.255
I did not do it for you.

360
00:16:18.279 --> 00:16:19.739
I did it for myself.

361
00:16:19.781 --> 00:16:21.133
I've been meaning to
quit for a long time.


362
00:16:21.157 --> 00:16:22.325
Hmm.

363
00:16:22.367 --> 00:16:23.618
I made a list of resolutions.

364
00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.079
I was going to
change everything.


365
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.246
My job, my life, everything.

366
00:16:27.288 --> 00:16:29.165
And I started too late.

367
00:16:29.207 --> 00:16:30.392
Well, tomorrow's the
first day of December.


368
00:16:30.416 --> 00:16:32.669
You still have 31 more days.

369
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:34.253
There is no way

370
00:16:34.295 --> 00:16:35.356
that I will make that
in time, but thank you.


371
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.839
I'll see a reindeer fly

372
00:16:36.881 --> 00:16:39.550
before I see Carley
Kincaid miss a deadline.


373
00:16:39.592 --> 00:16:41.427
Actually, come to think of it,

374
00:16:41.469 --> 00:16:42.345
who's gonna hit mine deadlines
now that you're gone?


375
00:16:42.387 --> 00:16:43.721
Why do you work there

376
00:16:43.763 --> 00:16:45.974
if you don't get
along with your dad?


377
00:16:46.015 --> 00:16:48.268
I live off my trust fund.

378
00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:50.311
And who do you
think has the key?


379
00:16:50.353 --> 00:16:52.105
Is that worth it?

380
00:16:52.146 --> 00:16:54.065
Anyway, I came here
to say thank you.


381
00:16:54.107 --> 00:16:55.483
I owe you.

382
00:16:55.525 --> 00:16:57.902
You're gonna get a
great severance package.


383
00:16:57.944 --> 00:16:59.362
I know you could use that.

384
00:16:59.404 --> 00:17:01.406
Okay, thank you so
much for coming by.


385
00:17:01.447 --> 00:17:02.508
You have a wonderful night.

386
00:17:02.532 --> 00:17:03.908
Oh, I wasn't gonna stay.

387
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:05.010
There's a North Pole-themed club

388
00:17:05.034 --> 00:17:06.411
in the Meatpacking District.

389
00:17:06.452 --> 00:17:08.288
New adventure awaits.

390
00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:10.290
Wow. That sounds horrible...

391
00:17:11.499 --> 00:17:14.127
Oh, say yes to adventure.

392
00:17:14.168 --> 00:17:16.796
Wait, take me with you.

393
00:17:16.838 --> 00:17:18.214
Excuse me?

394
00:17:18.256 --> 00:17:20.675
I will go to this
party with you.


395
00:17:20.717 --> 00:17:23.261
Oh my goodness. Twist my arm.

396
00:17:23.303 --> 00:17:24.512
Please take me with you.

397
00:17:24.554 --> 00:17:26.139
I don't think so, Kincaid.

398
00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.098
What? You don't
think I can handle it?


399
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.600
I know you can't.

400
00:17:28.641 --> 00:17:32.270
Listen, pal, I took
a bullet for you today,


401
00:17:32.312 --> 00:17:33.771
and all I am asking you

402
00:17:33.813 --> 00:17:37.150
for is just a little bit
of Christmas adventure.


403
00:17:37.191 --> 00:17:38.401
Hmm?

404
00:17:39.027 --> 00:17:40.403
Fine.

405
00:17:40.445 --> 00:17:41.988
You can come, but
don't embarrass me.


406
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.281
Great. Let's go.

407
00:17:46.117 --> 00:17:48.328
Right after I change my pajamas.

408
00:17:48.369 --> 00:17:50.496
Don't touch anything.

409
00:18:15.271 --> 00:18:17.565
Oh, it was just a dream.

410
00:18:35.208 --> 00:18:38.711
Merry Christmas, and
thank you for your donation.


411
00:18:38.753 --> 00:18:40.380
Isn't this just
adorable, sweetheart?


412
00:18:40.421 --> 00:18:42.340
The kids are going
to be so happy.


413
00:18:42.382 --> 00:18:44.133
It's a great haul
this year, Mom.


414
00:18:44.175 --> 00:18:45.694
Did I tell you we have a
new Santa Claus this year.


415
00:18:45.718 --> 00:18:47.512
A local theater
actor named Walter.


416
00:18:47.553 --> 00:18:48.930
Is he any good?

417
00:18:48.972 --> 00:18:50.265
He's one of those method types.

418
00:18:50.306 --> 00:18:51.724
Very committed to the role.

419
00:18:51.766 --> 00:18:52.952
Wants everyone to
call him Nicholas


420
00:18:52.976 --> 00:18:54.769
and refuses to remove the beard.

421
00:18:54.811 --> 00:18:55.996
I thought the toy drive
wasn't until Christmas Eve.


422
00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.272
Exactly.

423
00:18:57.313 --> 00:18:58.648
I half expect to
get a phone call


424
00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.734
that he's stuck in
a chimney somewhere.


425
00:19:01.776 --> 00:19:04.404
Two eggnogs, please.

426
00:19:04.445 --> 00:19:05.780
But how about you, honey?

427
00:19:05.822 --> 00:19:06.990
How are things at work?

428
00:19:07.031 --> 00:19:08.992
It hasn't been great, actually.

429
00:19:09.033 --> 00:19:11.577
Oh, honey, I know how
hard it's been on you,


430
00:19:11.619 --> 00:19:13.204
losing that promotion last year.

431
00:19:13.246 --> 00:19:14.247
Yeah.

432
00:19:14.289 --> 00:19:15.665
But you stuck with it.

433
00:19:15.707 --> 00:19:18.418
I can't tell you how
proud I am of you.


434
00:19:19.294 --> 00:19:21.087
Thanks.

435
00:19:21.129 --> 00:19:23.381
Somehow you always seem
to make the right decision.


436
00:19:23.423 --> 00:19:25.133
Yeah, that's me.

437
00:19:27.927 --> 00:19:30.239
What did you wanna be when you
grew up when you were a kid?


438
00:19:30.263 --> 00:19:31.598
I don't know.

439
00:19:31.639 --> 00:19:33.766
Probably a doctor
or a ballerina.


440
00:19:33.808 --> 00:19:35.476
The usual things.

441
00:19:35.518 --> 00:19:37.312
But nothing specific?

442
00:19:37.353 --> 00:19:40.690
Those kinds of memories fade
when you grow up, sweetheart.


443
00:19:40.732 --> 00:19:42.817
Besides my dreams came
true when you were born.


444
00:19:42.859 --> 00:19:44.527
Oh, Mom, come on.

445
00:19:44.569 --> 00:19:46.112
It's true.

446
00:19:46.154 --> 00:19:47.754
Gratitude is what
Christmas is all about.


447
00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.198
And I have you.

448
00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:49.949
What more could I want?

449
00:19:49.991 --> 00:19:51.034
Mm-hm.

450
00:19:56.914 --> 00:19:59.125
What more could I want?

451
00:20:16.142 --> 00:20:17.226
Whoa!

452
00:20:31.658 --> 00:20:32.825
Vincent?

453
00:20:37.914 --> 00:20:38.957
Gertie?

454
00:20:42.251 --> 00:20:43.503
What are you doing in here?

455
00:20:43.544 --> 00:20:44.712
Dusting.

456
00:20:45.838 --> 00:20:47.548
Well, can it wait
'til after breakfast?


457
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:50.969
Vincent, I desperately
need caffeine.


458
00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:54.222
I'm afraid that is not possible.

459
00:20:55.265 --> 00:20:57.558
Is the machine broken?

460
00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.979
No. Mr. Redmond
has instructed us...


461
00:21:02.063 --> 00:21:03.314
Told.

462
00:21:03.356 --> 00:21:05.900
Told us that we are
not to provide you


463
00:21:05.942 --> 00:21:07.568
with any of our services.

464
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:08.987
You're joking?

465
00:21:09.028 --> 00:21:12.198
You know how I feel about jokes,

466
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.950
Right.

467
00:21:13.992 --> 00:21:17.870
Well guess Dad just needs
some time to cool off.


468
00:21:17.912 --> 00:21:20.248
I can make my own coffee.

469
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.711
You guys can come out now.

470
00:21:24.752 --> 00:21:28.464
Actually, it could use
a good cleaning in here.


471
00:21:28.506 --> 00:21:29.506
Vincent?

472
00:21:33.136 --> 00:21:34.137
Okay.

473
00:21:37.599 --> 00:21:39.475
One latte coming up.

474
00:21:40.768 --> 00:21:43.146
How hard can it be?

475
00:21:43.938 --> 00:21:45.023
Ah!

476
00:21:55.575 --> 00:21:56.909
Hi.

477
00:21:56.951 --> 00:21:58.095
Are you caroling or soliciting?

478
00:21:58.119 --> 00:21:59.162
What?

479
00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.456
Oh, no, no, no, no.

480
00:22:01.497 --> 00:22:02.624
I'm neither.

481
00:22:02.665 --> 00:22:04.292
I'm a co-worker.

482
00:22:04.334 --> 00:22:07.253
Well, I'm a former
co-worker of Wyatt Redmond.


483
00:22:07.295 --> 00:22:08.463
Does he live here?

484
00:22:08.504 --> 00:22:11.049
I was not informed of a visit.

485
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:12.258
Okay.

486
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.469
Oh, it's okay.
Gertie. I know her.


487
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:16.638
Hi. I need to talk to you.

488
00:22:16.679 --> 00:22:17.889
It's important.

489
00:22:17.931 --> 00:22:20.308
Is this a friend of yours?

490
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:23.102
I wouldn't exactly
call us friends.


491
00:22:23.144 --> 00:22:24.604
Oh, friends.

492
00:22:24.646 --> 00:22:25.939
No, no, no, no, no, no.

493
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:26.856
We're just, we're co-workers.

494
00:22:26.898 --> 00:22:28.066
We work together.

495
00:22:28.107 --> 00:22:29.209
Well, we're not together, but...

496
00:22:29.233 --> 00:22:30.233
I see.

497
00:22:34.322 --> 00:22:35.323
Come in.

498
00:22:37.367 --> 00:22:38.409
Wow.

499
00:22:41.371 --> 00:22:42.789
Who are all these people?

500
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.166
Company my dad
hires to decorate.


501
00:22:45.208 --> 00:22:47.627
You don't do any of it yourself?

502
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:49.087
Why do it yourself

503
00:22:49.128 --> 00:22:51.297
when you can pay someone
to do it for you?


504
00:22:51.339 --> 00:22:52.799
I mean, you ever heard

505
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.425
of something called
Christmas spirit?


506
00:22:54.467 --> 00:22:56.261
Come on.

507
00:22:56.302 --> 00:22:58.113
My mom and I always have a
great time decorating our house.


508
00:22:58.137 --> 00:22:59.806
Somehow I can't picture my dad

509
00:22:59.847 --> 00:23:02.392
and I giggling over
bits of tinsel together.


510
00:23:02.433 --> 00:23:05.019
I mean, you can
just take stuff out


511
00:23:05.061 --> 00:23:06.062
of a box and hang it up.

512
00:23:06.104 --> 00:23:06.896
Look at these ornaments.

513
00:23:06.938 --> 00:23:07.897
They're so cute.

514
00:23:07.939 --> 00:23:08.731
They look homemade.

515
00:23:08.773 --> 00:23:10.316
Not those.

516
00:23:10.358 --> 00:23:11.484
Okay.

517
00:23:11.526 --> 00:23:12.360
Sorry. This shouldn't be here.

518
00:23:12.402 --> 00:23:14.153
That's fine.

519
00:23:14.195 --> 00:23:15.923
Gertie, someone took this
outta storage by mistake.


520
00:23:15.947 --> 00:23:17.299
Oh, actually, Mr. Wyatt,
I thought this year-


521
00:23:17.323 --> 00:23:18.741
- I don't think so.

522
00:23:18.783 --> 00:23:20.263
Please have someone
take it back down.


523
00:23:27.125 --> 00:23:28.126
Bye.

524
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:29.919
So good morning.

525
00:23:29.961 --> 00:23:31.337
I was actually hoping to talk.

526
00:23:31.379 --> 00:23:35.383
I was hoping to talk
to you about something.


527
00:23:35.425 --> 00:23:36.551
Et voila.

528
00:23:36.592 --> 00:23:38.177
What am I looking at?

529
00:23:38.219 --> 00:23:40.263
I turned my resolutions
into a checklist.


530
00:23:40.305 --> 00:23:42.098
I like the satisfaction
of checking them off.


531
00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.516
And you laminated it.

532
00:23:43.558 --> 00:23:45.059
- I did not.
- Cool.


533
00:23:45.101 --> 00:23:46.561
I didn't. I'm not crazy.

534
00:23:46.603 --> 00:23:49.480
This is a semi-gloss cardstock.

535
00:23:49.522 --> 00:23:50.523
Don't-

536
00:23:50.565 --> 00:23:51.524
- Quit your boring job.

537
00:23:51.566 --> 00:23:52.525
Follow your dreams.

538
00:23:52.567 --> 00:23:53.526
Say yes to adventure.

539
00:23:53.568 --> 00:23:54.360
Make a new friend.

540
00:23:54.402 --> 00:23:55.612
Take up running.

541
00:23:55.653 --> 00:23:56.755
Read a book from
start to finish.


542
00:23:56.779 --> 00:23:57.697
Cook Grammy's favorite recipe.

543
00:23:57.739 --> 00:23:59.365
Clean out closet.

544
00:23:59.407 --> 00:24:00.718
Is this a list of resolutions
or a list of chores?


545
00:24:00.742 --> 00:24:02.076
Please don't touch the list.

546
00:24:02.118 --> 00:24:03.512
I did four and then
I did extra credit.


547
00:24:03.536 --> 00:24:05.121
Big surprise. I count eight,

548
00:24:05.163 --> 00:24:07.915
Actually seven, because
I already quit my job.


549
00:24:07.957 --> 00:24:09.143
Technically you were fired.

550
00:24:09.167 --> 00:24:11.628
You wanna talk about that?

551
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:13.212
Fair.

552
00:24:13.254 --> 00:24:14.422
So, seven.

553
00:24:15.214 --> 00:24:16.633
Congrats.

554
00:24:16.674 --> 00:24:17.943
So did you come
here just to brag?


555
00:24:17.967 --> 00:24:19.469
I did not.

556
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.888
I came here because you
may have backed yourself


557
00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:23.973
into the first reasonable
idea you've ever had.


558
00:24:24.015 --> 00:24:26.017
I am going to try

559
00:24:26.059 --> 00:24:27.745
to finish my resolutions
before the end of the year.


560
00:24:27.769 --> 00:24:29.145
I am full of good ideas.

561
00:24:29.187 --> 00:24:31.606
You're not, but you
are gonna help me.


562
00:24:31.648 --> 00:24:33.191
I'm what?

563
00:24:33.232 --> 00:24:34.460
Well, I need someone
to hold me responsible.


564
00:24:34.484 --> 00:24:35.818
I need someone to push me,

565
00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:36.879
make sure I get
things done on time.


566
00:24:36.903 --> 00:24:37.862
Kincaid. Oh, Kincaid.

567
00:24:37.904 --> 00:24:39.781
I am many things.

568
00:24:39.822 --> 00:24:41.908
Stylish, charismatic, handsome.

569
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:43.618
Arrogant, entitled, floppy hair.

570
00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.955
But if there's one thing
I'm not, it's responsible.


571
00:24:46.996 --> 00:24:50.249
Why, of all people,
would you want my help?


572
00:24:50.291 --> 00:24:51.668
You do things.

573
00:24:53.127 --> 00:24:54.927
You put yourself out
there and you take risks.


574
00:24:54.963 --> 00:24:58.091
And you go to very
strange, unpleasant places


575
00:24:58.132 --> 00:24:59.944
that I would normally not,
like that party last night.


576
00:24:59.968 --> 00:25:00.969
Look at that.

577
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:01.761
You did have fun.

578
00:25:01.803 --> 00:25:02.887
I did not.

579
00:25:02.929 --> 00:25:04.764
It was incredibly loud.

580
00:25:04.806 --> 00:25:05.765
There was glitter in places
that are not meant to sparkle.


581
00:25:05.807 --> 00:25:07.433
Anyway, the point is,

582
00:25:07.475 --> 00:25:09.602
I wouldn't have had
the whole experience


583
00:25:09.644 --> 00:25:11.104
if it weren't for you.

584
00:25:11.145 --> 00:25:13.564
So look, I feel like I
wasted an entire year.


585
00:25:13.606 --> 00:25:16.693
And frustratingly you are right.

586
00:25:16.734 --> 00:25:18.111
There are 31 days left.

587
00:25:18.152 --> 00:25:20.613
I have 31 chances
to change my life.


588
00:25:20.655 --> 00:25:23.408
And you are gonna help me
because you owe me one.


589
00:25:23.449 --> 00:25:26.494
Look, I wanna
help you out. I do.


590
00:25:26.536 --> 00:25:27.996
And I would,

591
00:25:28.037 --> 00:25:30.331
but I can't even help
myself right now.


592
00:25:30.373 --> 00:25:32.083
I thought my dad was
bluffing yesterday,


593
00:25:32.125 --> 00:25:33.960
but he completely cut me off.

594
00:25:34.002 --> 00:25:34.919
Emotionally?

595
00:25:34.961 --> 00:25:36.421
Ha. Financially.

596
00:25:36.462 --> 00:25:38.840
So good luck with
this whole thing,


597
00:25:38.881 --> 00:25:42.260
but I am off to humble
myself before my father.


598
00:25:42.302 --> 00:25:43.612
Is that really
what you wanna do?


599
00:25:43.636 --> 00:25:44.512
Ah!

600
00:25:44.554 --> 00:25:46.264
Could you get...

601
00:25:47.265 --> 00:25:49.434
I don't have a choice, Kincaid.

602
00:25:49.475 --> 00:25:51.519
I live in his house.
I spend his money.


603
00:25:51.561 --> 00:25:53.497
I don't even know how to
make my own cup of coffee.


604
00:25:53.521 --> 00:25:55.064
That is very apparent.

605
00:25:55.106 --> 00:25:58.401
Listen, why don't
we do a trade, huh?


606
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.531
I can help you be
more independent.


607
00:26:04.449 --> 00:26:05.742
What? I can.

608
00:26:05.783 --> 00:26:07.243
I'm really responsible
with money.


609
00:26:07.285 --> 00:26:09.287
I saved every babysitting check

610
00:26:09.329 --> 00:26:11.205
and all of my birthday money.

611
00:26:11.247 --> 00:26:14.876
I am renting a spare room
from a 70-year-old retiree,


612
00:26:14.917 --> 00:26:16.294
so that I can put
more in savings.


613
00:26:16.336 --> 00:26:17.879
We both wanna make
a change Wyatt,


614
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.715
so why don't we help each other?

615
00:26:29.265 --> 00:26:30.516
Oh, that's really good.

616
00:26:30.558 --> 00:26:31.559
I know.

617
00:26:32.435 --> 00:26:33.436
Deal.

618
00:26:35.188 --> 00:26:37.607
I'm gonna hang onto this.

619
00:26:57.669 --> 00:26:58.836
I'm ready.

620
00:27:01.589 --> 00:27:02.674
I'm ready.

621
00:27:04.258 --> 00:27:07.220
Okay. So I thought we'd
start with something simple,


622
00:27:07.262 --> 00:27:10.390
but take up running
is too vague.


623
00:27:10.431 --> 00:27:11.849
There's no way for
us to measure it.


624
00:27:11.891 --> 00:27:13.393
Oh, okay.

625
00:27:13.434 --> 00:27:17.647
Well, I've always wanted
to run the Christmas 5K.


626
00:27:17.689 --> 00:27:20.692
Well, then we better start
training like right now.


627
00:27:20.733 --> 00:27:22.068
Copy.

628
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.404
All right, New York City.

629
00:27:24.445 --> 00:27:28.199
Get ready to meet a
whole new version of me.


630
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:30.952
Let's go!

631
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.050
You okay?

632
00:27:46.092 --> 00:27:47.051
How many is that?

633
00:27:47.093 --> 00:27:47.719
Four, maybe five.

634
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.595
Miles?

635
00:27:48.636 --> 00:27:49.512
Blocks.

636
00:27:49.554 --> 00:27:50.930
Great, great.

637
00:27:50.972 --> 00:27:52.140
Okay.

638
00:27:53.141 --> 00:27:54.726
What are you doing?

639
00:27:54.767 --> 00:27:56.370
Oh, I'm thinking my
lungs are about to explode.


640
00:27:56.394 --> 00:27:57.312
And if they are, I would
like my last breaths


641
00:27:57.353 --> 00:27:58.938
to smell like Christmas.

642
00:27:58.980 --> 00:27:59.999
You really love
the holidays, huh?


643
00:28:00.023 --> 00:28:01.065
Yeah, of course I do.

644
00:28:01.107 --> 00:28:02.567
What's there not to love?

645
00:28:02.609 --> 00:28:05.069
There's magic and
music and memories


646
00:28:05.111 --> 00:28:06.821
and other M words.

647
00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.116
A simple yes would do.

648
00:28:10.158 --> 00:28:11.534
What? It smells
like Christmas.


649
00:28:11.576 --> 00:28:12.660
Here, smell.

650
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:16.497
Does it smell like Christmas?

651
00:28:17.749 --> 00:28:19.083
Reminds me of my mom.

652
00:28:19.125 --> 00:28:20.335
Oh, that's nice.

653
00:28:20.376 --> 00:28:22.795
That was her favorite smell.

654
00:28:22.837 --> 00:28:23.897
It was her favorite smell?

655
00:28:23.921 --> 00:28:24.922
Yeah.

656
00:28:26.007 --> 00:28:26.966
When did she pass?

657
00:28:27.008 --> 00:28:28.593
Eight years ago.

658
00:28:28.635 --> 00:28:30.178
Oh, I'm sorry.

659
00:28:31.679 --> 00:28:33.973
You know, if you wanna,

660
00:28:34.015 --> 00:28:35.808
we could just take a
break with the tree.


661
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.560
A break?

662
00:28:37.602 --> 00:28:39.246
Thought you were serious
about this list, Kincaid.


663
00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:40.790
I'm serious. I'm a
very serious person.


664
00:28:41.189 --> 00:28:42.398
I could do this all day.

665
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.399
I don't know why
you're laughing.


666
00:28:43.441 --> 00:28:44.776
Come on. I'm going do...

667
00:28:44.817 --> 00:28:46.110
Okay.

668
00:28:46.152 --> 00:28:47.320
Kincaid.

669
00:28:47.987 --> 00:28:49.322
I'm good.

670
00:28:57.038 --> 00:28:58.140
Ow. Can you close that?
Yeah.


671
00:28:58.164 --> 00:28:59.415
Ow.

672
00:28:59.916 --> 00:29:00.917
Ow.

673
00:29:02.293 --> 00:29:04.337
Sweetheart, what happened?

674
00:29:04.379 --> 00:29:05.630
I just broke my leg.

675
00:29:05.672 --> 00:29:06.839
She didn't break her leg.

676
00:29:06.881 --> 00:29:08.049
It's a muscle cramp.

677
00:29:08.091 --> 00:29:09.717
It shouldn't be on the list.

678
00:29:09.759 --> 00:29:12.887
Maybe we should start
with an easier resolution.


679
00:29:12.929 --> 00:29:14.764
Mm. Keep.
Donate.


680
00:29:14.806 --> 00:29:16.099
- What? I love. Keep.
- Donate.


681
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.100
Are you just gonna...

682
00:29:17.141 --> 00:29:18.476
Keep!
Donate.


683
00:29:18.518 --> 00:29:19.978
- Keep.
- Donate.


684
00:29:20.019 --> 00:29:21.271
- Keep.
- Donate.


685
00:29:21.312 --> 00:29:22.480
Why?

686
00:29:22.522 --> 00:29:23.648
You're not even listening.

687
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:24.857
- Keep!
- Donate.


688
00:29:24.899 --> 00:29:26.276
Keep. Keep.

689
00:29:26.317 --> 00:29:27.235
Kincaid, this
doesn't even fit you.


690
00:29:27.277 --> 00:29:28.236
It could fit a dog.

691
00:29:28.278 --> 00:29:29.654
You don't have a dog.

692
00:29:29.696 --> 00:29:31.447
I will at some point in my life.

693
00:29:31.489 --> 00:29:32.240
- I'm sure. Keep, keep, keep.
- Donate.


694
00:29:32.282 --> 00:29:33.074
I can't.

695
00:29:33.116 --> 00:29:34.534
You can.

696
00:29:34.575 --> 00:29:35.719
No, it's my first sewing project

697
00:29:35.743 --> 00:29:36.369
that I completed with my mom.

698
00:29:36.411 --> 00:29:37.411
Just...

699
00:29:38.371 --> 00:29:39.205
Keep.

700
00:29:39.247 --> 00:29:40.415
Thank you.

701
00:29:40.456 --> 00:29:42.292
Wow. That was not easy.

702
00:29:42.333 --> 00:29:44.419
At least you can check
off one more resolution


703
00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.962
At what cost?

704
00:29:49.257 --> 00:29:50.174
How's the leg?

705
00:29:50.216 --> 00:29:51.134
It's feeling better.

706
00:29:51.175 --> 00:29:52.260
Ah!

707
00:29:52.302 --> 00:29:54.178
Here, lemme see.

708
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.531
Oh, that's actually really good.

709
00:29:55.555 --> 00:29:57.056
You gotta hydrate more.

710
00:29:57.098 --> 00:29:58.701
We should look at your
fruit and veggie intake.


711
00:29:58.725 --> 00:30:00.560
It's easy for you to say.

712
00:30:00.602 --> 00:30:01.996
You probably have a personal
nutritionist on call.


713
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.605
Nope. Don't need one.

714
00:30:03.646 --> 00:30:04.790
I've always been a
perfect physical specimen.


715
00:30:04.814 --> 00:30:05.857
Gross.

716
00:30:06.482 --> 00:30:07.859
How's that?

717
00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:11.112
Little to the left, actually.

718
00:30:11.154 --> 00:30:12.196
Yeah. Yeah.

719
00:30:13.615 --> 00:30:15.199
Why don't you just
wait a few weeks


720
00:30:15.241 --> 00:30:16.993
and start the list
over next year?


721
00:30:17.035 --> 00:30:19.078
I promised my best
friend who moved away


722
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.374
that I would start living
my life to the fullest.


723
00:30:23.416 --> 00:30:24.602
And she's coming
back for the holidays


724
00:30:24.626 --> 00:30:27.253
and I have not changed enough.

725
00:30:28.504 --> 00:30:30.214
Trying to prove
something to her?


726
00:30:30.256 --> 00:30:34.218
I don't wanna disappoint
her, but I don't know.


727
00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.678
I wanna prove
something to myself.


728
00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.323
It was always tomorrow,
and then next week,


729
00:30:37.347 --> 00:30:38.449
and next month and next year.

730
00:30:38.473 --> 00:30:40.475
And that's how I got here.

731
00:30:42.352 --> 00:30:46.105
I'm just tired of
postponing my dreams.


732
00:30:46.147 --> 00:30:48.775
And what do you dream about?

733
00:30:53.613 --> 00:30:54.447
Take a look.

734
00:30:54.489 --> 00:30:55.907
What's this?

735
00:30:55.949 --> 00:30:59.160
I've always wanted to
be in fashion design.


736
00:30:59.202 --> 00:31:02.330
Kincaid! These
are really good.


737
00:31:02.372 --> 00:31:03.790
You think so?

738
00:31:03.831 --> 00:31:05.458
Why don't you follow your dream?

739
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.460
Apply for a job as
a fashion assistant.


740
00:31:07.502 --> 00:31:09.212
Check it off the list.

741
00:31:09.253 --> 00:31:12.674
Because you can't just apply
to be a fashion assistant.


742
00:31:12.715 --> 00:31:14.968
My sewing is just above average.

743
00:31:15.009 --> 00:31:16.386
I'm out of practice.

744
00:31:16.427 --> 00:31:17.762
This is harder than I thought.

745
00:31:17.804 --> 00:31:19.365
Yeah, obviously I
would've done it by now.


746
00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:21.033
No, the knot. I think
it's your hamstring.


747
00:31:22.558 --> 00:31:23.744
I'll think about
the sewing thing,


748
00:31:23.768 --> 00:31:24.686
but as your new life coach...

749
00:31:24.727 --> 00:31:26.145
Never called you that.

750
00:31:26.187 --> 00:31:27.188
- Didn't have to.
- Nope.


751
00:31:28.231 --> 00:31:29.232
Found it.

752
00:31:29.274 --> 00:31:31.150
How does that feel?

753
00:31:31.192 --> 00:31:34.654
Oh, that actually
feels really great.


754
00:31:47.125 --> 00:31:49.419
I got you some bananas.

755
00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.378
Hi. Thanks.

756
00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.838
For your cramp.

757
00:31:51.879 --> 00:31:53.381
Yeah, you know
what? This is fine.


758
00:31:53.423 --> 00:31:54.424
I'm actually fine.

759
00:31:54.465 --> 00:31:55.425
Are you sure?

760
00:31:55.466 --> 00:31:56.509
I barely dug in.
Yes.


761
00:31:56.551 --> 00:31:57.635
No, it's really good.

762
00:31:57.677 --> 00:31:58.761
It's like I have a new leg.

763
00:31:58.803 --> 00:31:59.843
You're amazing. Fantastic.

764
00:32:24.037 --> 00:32:25.747
What's going on?

765
00:32:25.788 --> 00:32:28.207
Lesson number one,
early bird gets the worm.


766
00:32:28.249 --> 00:32:29.667
What are you doing in here?

767
00:32:29.709 --> 00:32:31.377
If you wanna stop
working for your dad,


768
00:32:31.419 --> 00:32:32.938
you're gonna have to get your
own job eventually, right?


769
00:32:32.962 --> 00:32:34.047
So?

770
00:32:34.088 --> 00:32:35.423
So other employers aren't gonna

771
00:32:35.465 --> 00:32:37.300
let you sleep in 'til noon.

772
00:32:37.342 --> 00:32:41.304
So from now on, you'll
be getting up at 7:00 AM.


773
00:32:41.346 --> 00:32:43.598
Yay! Responsibility.

774
00:32:44.849 --> 00:32:47.143
Why did I agree to do this?

775
00:32:47.185 --> 00:32:48.185
Get up.

776
00:32:52.482 --> 00:32:53.942
Your coffee's on the counter.

777
00:32:53.983 --> 00:32:56.444
Oh, what are you working on?

778
00:32:56.486 --> 00:32:57.779
It's my resolution.

779
00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:58.696
I'm reading a book
start to finish.


780
00:32:58.738 --> 00:33:00.490
Please go away.

781
00:33:00.531 --> 00:33:01.800
"War and Peace." Do you ever
do anything easy, Kincaid?


782
00:33:01.824 --> 00:33:04.327
Do you ever do anything hard?

783
00:33:05.203 --> 00:33:06.537
Well, I better call a cab.

784
00:33:06.579 --> 00:33:08.039
Eh, wrong.

785
00:33:08.081 --> 00:33:09.642
You're supposed to be
saving money, remember?


786
00:33:09.666 --> 00:33:10.541
How else am I
supposed to get to work?


787
00:33:10.583 --> 00:33:12.251
Merry Christmas.

788
00:33:12.293 --> 00:33:14.173
You are now the proud
owner of a MetroCard. Wow.


789
00:33:14.212 --> 00:33:15.171
Having fun?

790
00:33:15.213 --> 00:33:16.631
You have no idea.

791
00:33:16.673 --> 00:33:18.967
Oh, I have a lesson for you too.

792
00:33:19.008 --> 00:33:20.051
Mm-hm.

793
00:33:21.636 --> 00:33:23.096
Hey. No writing on the list.

794
00:33:23.137 --> 00:33:27.183
You're not authorized
to write on the list.


795
00:33:27.225 --> 00:33:28.309
Upgrade my sewing skills.

796
00:33:28.351 --> 00:33:29.435
Nice.

797
00:33:29.477 --> 00:33:30.603
It's an easy one.

798
00:33:30.645 --> 00:33:31.396
Who's gonna teach me? You?

799
00:33:31.437 --> 00:33:32.437
Of course not.

800
00:33:34.023 --> 00:33:36.359
You want to do fashion,
then I will teach you.


801
00:33:36.401 --> 00:33:38.945
Gertie knows her way
around a needle and a thread.


802
00:33:38.987 --> 00:33:40.488
- Okay, well that's not-
- No talking!


803
00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:41.614
Follow me.

804
00:33:43.408 --> 00:33:44.659
I hope you miss your train.

805
00:33:44.701 --> 00:33:45.952
Have fun.

806
00:33:50.164 --> 00:33:53.835
Oh, and I want you
to remind everyone


807
00:33:53.876 --> 00:33:57.171
that this year's secret
Santa limit is 20 bucks.


808
00:33:57.213 --> 00:33:58.172
Morning, Pop.

809
00:33:58.214 --> 00:33:59.382
Hey.

810
00:33:59.424 --> 00:34:01.676
Steve, nice Christmas sweater.

811
00:34:01.718 --> 00:34:03.469
Morning, team.

812
00:34:03.511 --> 00:34:05.763
How are those
reports coming along?


813
00:34:12.604 --> 00:34:14.188
Keep the stitching uniform.

814
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:15.940
I'm trying.

815
00:34:16.566 --> 00:34:17.483
Ow.

816
00:34:17.525 --> 00:34:18.943
I'm okay.

817
00:34:18.985 --> 00:34:20.129
You want to be
as designer, yeah?


818
00:34:20.153 --> 00:34:21.738
Mm-hm.

819
00:34:21.779 --> 00:34:22.447
You want to make
beautiful things like this?


820
00:34:22.488 --> 00:34:23.865
Mm-hm.

821
00:34:23.906 --> 00:34:26.534
Then what is one
drop of blood today


822
00:34:26.576 --> 00:34:28.536
if you achieve victory tomorrow?

823
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:30.955
You're very intense.

824
00:34:30.997 --> 00:34:32.832
Has anybody ever told you that?

825
00:34:32.874 --> 00:34:34.542
No. Thank you.

826
00:34:34.584 --> 00:34:36.210
You're welcome.

827
00:34:36.252 --> 00:34:38.713
So you're telling me
that this woman was fired,


828
00:34:38.755 --> 00:34:40.131
but now the two of you are

829
00:34:40.173 --> 00:34:42.342
in some kind of
holiday self-help pact?


830
00:34:42.383 --> 00:34:43.551
Pretty much.

831
00:34:43.593 --> 00:34:45.136
Look, Brad, do me a favor.

832
00:34:45.178 --> 00:34:46.262
Don't tell Kendra.

833
00:34:46.304 --> 00:34:48.765
Hey, Wyatt, we miss you.

834
00:34:50.058 --> 00:34:51.827
Can you please explain
some proper phone etiquette


835
00:34:51.851 --> 00:34:53.728
to your neanderthal husband?

836
00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:55.438
Only if you agree to come out

837
00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.856
to Jackson Heights next week.

838
00:34:56.898 --> 00:34:58.274
It's our family
tradition, Wyatt.


839
00:34:58.316 --> 00:34:59.734
That includes you.

840
00:34:59.776 --> 00:35:01.819
Bring this new
girlfriend of yours.


841
00:35:01.861 --> 00:35:02.737
Girlfriend? No.

842
00:35:02.779 --> 00:35:03.947
No, no, no.

843
00:35:03.988 --> 00:35:05.573
This is strictly business.

844
00:35:05.615 --> 00:35:07.075
- Strictly business.
- Right, yeah.


845
00:35:07.116 --> 00:35:09.243
Okay, Wyatt, we'll
see you two next week.


846
00:35:23.925 --> 00:35:28.388
So remember, folks, three
pieces of tape or less.


847
00:35:32.016 --> 00:35:33.017
Hello. You made it.

848
00:35:33.059 --> 00:35:34.769
I come bearing gifts.

849
00:35:34.811 --> 00:35:37.272
Ooh, you really
dressed up for this, huh?


850
00:35:37.313 --> 00:35:40.358
Yeah. It's not my first
wrap party, Kincaid.


851
00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.527
One of my friends
is on Broadway.


852
00:35:42.568 --> 00:35:43.820
I think I know how to fit in.

853
00:35:43.861 --> 00:35:45.113
Ah, okay.

854
00:35:46.197 --> 00:35:49.575
So I said wrap party
like wrapping presents.


855
00:35:51.744 --> 00:35:53.663
- That's a thing?
- Mm-hm.


856
00:35:53.705 --> 00:35:55.206
Hey everyone, this
is Wyatt Redmond.


857
00:35:55.248 --> 00:35:57.375
Wyatt, this is
Millie's bridge club.


858
00:35:57.417 --> 00:35:59.043
Hello!

859
00:35:59.085 --> 00:36:00.854
They offered to help my
mom with her toy drive.


860
00:36:00.878 --> 00:36:02.630
- Mm.
- Mm-hm.


861
00:36:02.672 --> 00:36:04.173
So you're Carley's boss?

862
00:36:04.215 --> 00:36:05.883
The one who stole my
daughter's promotion?


863
00:36:05.925 --> 00:36:07.927
- Mom!
- Yeah, that would be me.


864
00:36:07.969 --> 00:36:10.013
Mrs. Kincaid. Very
nice to meet you.


865
00:36:10.054 --> 00:36:11.723
But I'm not her boss anymore.

866
00:36:11.764 --> 00:36:12.724
Since when?

867
00:36:12.765 --> 00:36:14.183
Since she got fired.

868
00:36:14.225 --> 00:36:17.478
Since I got fired up
about working as a team.


869
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.440
- A team?
- Yes. As a team.


870
00:36:20.481 --> 00:36:21.983
Yes. Right.

871
00:36:22.025 --> 00:36:25.320
I think what I realized,
the company realized,


872
00:36:25.361 --> 00:36:29.449
is that Carley was being
seriously undervalued.


873
00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:30.658
About time.

874
00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:31.969
And I'll be the first to admit

875
00:36:31.993 --> 00:36:33.828
that we should have
seen it sooner.


876
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:37.790
The company is very lucky to
have such a special employee.


877
00:36:37.832 --> 00:36:39.459
I'm glad to hear it.

878
00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.003
And I must say, it's really
nice of you to join us


879
00:36:42.045 --> 00:36:43.463
for such a good cause.

880
00:36:43.504 --> 00:36:44.547
Happy to be here.

881
00:36:44.589 --> 00:36:45.548
Come meet the group.

882
00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:46.591
Sort of.

883
00:36:47.425 --> 00:36:48.468
Enjoy.

884
00:36:49.427 --> 00:36:51.763
What do you call a selfish elf?

885
00:36:51.804 --> 00:36:52.639
Elfish.

886
00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.349
Oh!

887
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:55.850
Not bad, right?

888
00:36:55.892 --> 00:36:58.227
The toy drive's gonna
be great this year, Mom.


889
00:36:58.269 --> 00:37:00.188
Is Santa Claus
still in character?


890
00:37:00.229 --> 00:37:02.941
Walter is on a strict
diet of milk and cookies.


891
00:37:02.982 --> 00:37:04.108
Sounds nice.

892
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:05.693
So is this really the same man

893
00:37:05.735 --> 00:37:07.046
that you've been
complaining about all year?


894
00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:08.071
What do you got?

895
00:37:08.112 --> 00:37:09.530
What are you hiding?

896
00:37:09.572 --> 00:37:10.674
He's not exactly
what I thought he was.


897
00:37:10.698 --> 00:37:12.241
It's very confusing.

898
00:37:12.283 --> 00:37:13.510
Do you have something
that you wanna tell me?


899
00:37:13.534 --> 00:37:15.662
Oh yeah, actually I do.

900
00:37:15.703 --> 00:37:17.121
I knew it.

901
00:37:17.163 --> 00:37:19.123
Why have you been
hiding it from me?


902
00:37:19.165 --> 00:37:21.334
You've always told me about
your crushes in the past.


903
00:37:21.376 --> 00:37:23.628
Crush? What are
you talking about?


904
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:25.088
Oh, you mean Wyatt?

905
00:37:25.129 --> 00:37:26.965
I like him.

906
00:37:27.006 --> 00:37:28.067
But be careful with office
romances, sweetheart.


907
00:37:28.091 --> 00:37:29.676
They can end badly.

908
00:37:29.717 --> 00:37:31.177
Mom. No, no, no, no.

909
00:37:31.219 --> 00:37:33.304
We're not. We work
together. That's it.


910
00:37:33.346 --> 00:37:36.683
If you say so, but you
can't keep secrets from me.


911
00:37:36.724 --> 00:37:38.059
Sure. So on that note,

912
00:37:38.101 --> 00:37:39.978
Got you a little
something, Mrs. Kincaid.


913
00:37:40.019 --> 00:37:43.606
It's nothing special,
but it's something.


914
00:37:43.648 --> 00:37:44.983
That's lovely, dear.

915
00:37:45.024 --> 00:37:47.819
Thank you. I will
add it to the pile.


916
00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:51.614
- Hi.
- Hey.


917
00:37:52.824 --> 00:37:54.325
Well, I'm actually
having a lotta fun.


918
00:37:54.367 --> 00:37:56.136
Yeah. You know, it's
not a sweaty nightclub,


919
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.496
but Millie throws
a heck of a party.


920
00:37:58.538 --> 00:37:59.789
Hors d'oeuvre?

921
00:38:00.915 --> 00:38:02.458
I know you invited
me to this thing


922
00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.377
as your friendship
wing man tonight,


923
00:38:04.419 --> 00:38:07.630
but I was thinking you'd
aim a few decades younger.


924
00:38:07.672 --> 00:38:08.548
What are you talking about?

925
00:38:08.589 --> 00:38:10.008
These are my people.

926
00:38:10.049 --> 00:38:12.677
Look, I have five
friend requests.


927
00:38:12.719 --> 00:38:14.429
Oh, I wouldn't accept Arlene's.

928
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:16.889
Yeah. She posts some
pretty extreme stuff.


929
00:38:21.686 --> 00:38:23.646
Making friends as an
adult is so complicated.


930
00:38:23.688 --> 00:38:25.207
When I was a kid, you could
just go up to somebody


931
00:38:25.231 --> 00:38:26.858
and say, hi, my name's Carley.

932
00:38:26.899 --> 00:38:27.775
Do you wanna be my friend?

933
00:38:27.817 --> 00:38:29.360
Poof. It's done.

934
00:38:29.402 --> 00:38:31.571
Ooh, are these
pastries for everyone?


935
00:38:31.613 --> 00:38:32.447
Yes, they are.

936
00:38:32.488 --> 00:38:33.114
Help yourself.

937
00:38:33.156 --> 00:38:34.866
Oh, thank you.

938
00:38:34.907 --> 00:38:37.035
Such a nice young lady.

939
00:38:37.076 --> 00:38:38.870
You remind me of my third wife.

940
00:38:38.911 --> 00:38:40.204
How sweet.

941
00:38:40.246 --> 00:38:42.081
Would you care to be my fourth?

942
00:38:42.123 --> 00:38:44.125
Don't even think
about it, Randall.


943
00:38:44.167 --> 00:38:45.918
She's out of your league.

944
00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.587
I'm quite wealthy, you know?

945
00:38:47.629 --> 00:38:48.421
Okay.

946
00:38:48.463 --> 00:38:49.172
Wow.

947
00:38:49.213 --> 00:38:50.673
He seems nice.

948
00:38:50.715 --> 00:38:52.091
You better get her outta here

949
00:38:52.133 --> 00:38:53.968
before Randall tries
to put her in his will.


950
00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:55.386
I'm on it.

951
00:38:55.428 --> 00:38:57.180
I'm just saying, he seems nice.

952
00:38:57.221 --> 00:38:59.849
I am just gonna grab a jacket.

953
00:39:01.225 --> 00:39:03.102
Gertie's lessons are paying off.

954
00:39:03.144 --> 00:39:05.271
Yeah, she's
really good at motivating me.


955
00:39:05.313 --> 00:39:06.898
She's like scary Oprah.

956
00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.566
She says I'm not
allowed to check off


957
00:39:08.608 --> 00:39:10.210
that sewing resolution
until I finish the dress.


958
00:39:10.234 --> 00:39:12.070
Which is unfair,

959
00:39:12.111 --> 00:39:13.071
'cause I feel like she's
teaching me fancy stitches


960
00:39:13.112 --> 00:39:14.656
before normal ones.

961
00:39:14.697 --> 00:39:16.091
Like do you know what
an overlock stitch is?


962
00:39:16.115 --> 00:39:16.908
It's like the
tuxedo of stitches.


963
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:17.700
This you?

964
00:39:17.742 --> 00:39:18.742
Hmm?

965
00:39:19.327 --> 00:39:20.620
Oh, yep.

966
00:39:20.662 --> 00:39:22.121
Yes. That is me.

967
00:39:22.163 --> 00:39:24.415
I used to make dresses
out of wrapping paper


968
00:39:24.457 --> 00:39:27.418
and just whatever
was around the house.


969
00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:31.631
We didn't have a ton of
money growing up, so...


970
00:39:33.466 --> 00:39:34.717
Really cute.

971
00:39:36.135 --> 00:39:37.571
My mom says that childhood
dreams are supposed


972
00:39:37.595 --> 00:39:40.056
to fade after a
little while, but...


973
00:39:40.098 --> 00:39:41.307
Not this one.

974
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:42.934
Mm-mm.

975
00:39:42.976 --> 00:39:45.395
Is that why you haven't told
your mom you quit your job?


976
00:39:45.436 --> 00:39:48.606
My mom raised me
mostly by herself.


977
00:39:48.648 --> 00:39:52.485
She had three jobs
just to make ends meet.


978
00:39:53.861 --> 00:39:55.446
And somehow she always managed

979
00:39:55.488 --> 00:39:58.491
to make things like Christmas
feel really special.


980
00:39:58.533 --> 00:40:00.285
I don't think that I
understood how hard


981
00:40:00.326 --> 00:40:03.371
that must have been on
her until I got older.


982
00:40:03.413 --> 00:40:04.956
She never complained.

983
00:40:06.457 --> 00:40:08.126
She never took any
time for herself.


984
00:40:08.167 --> 00:40:09.877
She saved every
penny that we had


985
00:40:09.919 --> 00:40:11.879
so that I could go to college.

986
00:40:11.921 --> 00:40:13.506
And I wanted to pay her back.

987
00:40:13.548 --> 00:40:16.551
So I got the first steady
job that I could find.


988
00:40:16.592 --> 00:40:18.261
Comfort Mills.

989
00:40:18.303 --> 00:40:20.597
Mm-hm. She really did
sacrifice everything for me.


990
00:40:20.638 --> 00:40:24.767
And it seems selfish to
throw that away for something


991
00:40:24.809 --> 00:40:29.772
that, I don't know, that I
wanted to do when I was six.


992
00:40:31.316 --> 00:40:34.152
Listen, I may not be the
best person to say this,


993
00:40:34.193 --> 00:40:37.905
but I think it's entirely
possible to be grateful


994
00:40:37.947 --> 00:40:42.452
for what you have and
still want more outta life.


995
00:40:46.789 --> 00:40:49.292
Come on, let's go get
you some new friends.


996
00:40:49.334 --> 00:40:50.710
You need them.

997
00:40:54.339 --> 00:40:56.215
So there's this bar

998
00:40:56.257 --> 00:40:57.943
in Chelsea hosting a Christmas
cocktail competition.


999
00:40:57.967 --> 00:41:01.346
And afterward, I hear there's
this mistletoe masquerade


1000
00:41:01.387 --> 00:41:02.680
somewhere in Lower Manhattan.

1001
00:41:02.722 --> 00:41:04.182
Wow.

1002
00:41:04.223 --> 00:41:05.326
Very exclusive. But I
think I can get us in.


1003
00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:06.851
Uh-huh.

1004
00:41:06.893 --> 00:41:07.894
Kincaid?

1005
00:41:09.228 --> 00:41:10.908
Oh, they did a nice
job, don't you think?


1006
00:41:10.939 --> 00:41:12.398
Yeah, they sure did.

1007
00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.691
Yeah.

1008
00:41:13.733 --> 00:41:15.568
Hey, we don't have
to go to this thing.


1009
00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:19.489
Oh no, I'm sorry. I
have this thing where I...


1010
00:41:21.658 --> 00:41:24.744
I just have trouble letting
people get close to me.


1011
00:41:24.786 --> 00:41:26.537
Been burned before?

1012
00:41:26.579 --> 00:41:28.289
My dad left when I was eight.

1013
00:41:28.331 --> 00:41:30.041
Has something to do with it.

1014
00:41:30.083 --> 00:41:31.250
I'm sorry to hear that.

1015
00:41:31.292 --> 00:41:32.961
It's okay.

1016
00:41:33.002 --> 00:41:34.647
Just made a series of
questionable romantic decisions


1017
00:41:34.671 --> 00:41:36.756
in college, but that
none of your business.


1018
00:41:36.798 --> 00:41:38.091
Hold on a sec.

1019
00:41:38.132 --> 00:41:39.425
Are we still talking about you?

1020
00:41:39.467 --> 00:41:40.718
QuickBooks Kincaid?

1021
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.095
Yeah, I'm not a nun.

1022
00:41:42.136 --> 00:41:45.223
I just have trouble
trusting people.


1023
00:41:45.265 --> 00:41:46.766
You probably think that's silly.

1024
00:41:46.808 --> 00:41:48.893
No, no, I don't.

1025
00:41:48.935 --> 00:41:53.106
You know, even though my
mom didn't have a choice,


1026
00:41:53.147 --> 00:41:54.983
I still get angry
that she's gone.


1027
00:41:55.024 --> 00:41:57.652
Yeah, I can understand that.

1028
00:42:02.115 --> 00:42:03.199
Hi, my name's Carley.

1029
00:42:03.241 --> 00:42:04.617
Do you wanna be my friend?

1030
00:42:06.494 --> 00:42:08.121
You really wanna
make this official?


1031
00:42:08.162 --> 00:42:09.390
Well, I mean, I
see you too often


1032
00:42:09.414 --> 00:42:10.599
for you to just be a co-worker

1033
00:42:10.623 --> 00:42:13.334
and you did steal my job so...

1034
00:42:13.376 --> 00:42:14.794
Why does everyone make it out

1035
00:42:14.836 --> 00:42:16.188
that I'm the Grinch
and you're Cindy Lou?


1036
00:42:16.212 --> 00:42:17.171
Because it's true.

1037
00:42:17.213 --> 00:42:18.172
It wasn't my idea.

1038
00:42:18.214 --> 00:42:19.340
I can't help you.

1039
00:42:21.843 --> 00:42:23.428
Okay, friends.

1040
00:42:27.223 --> 00:42:28.933
Friends.

1041
00:42:28.975 --> 00:42:29.975
Let's go.

1042
00:42:39.861 --> 00:42:42.697
It's got central AC,
a washer-dryer unit.


1043
00:42:42.739 --> 00:42:46.659
Nothing fancy, but it's
all in working order.


1044
00:42:51.289 --> 00:42:53.958
Look at how high ceilings are.

1045
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.585
Yeah. Not bad.

1046
00:42:56.169 --> 00:42:58.463
Can we see the upstairs?

1047
00:42:59.005 --> 00:43:01.424
Sorry. This is it.

1048
00:43:01.466 --> 00:43:03.468
- This is it?
- Yep.


1049
00:43:05.011 --> 00:43:06.429
Come on. It's south-facing.

1050
00:43:06.471 --> 00:43:07.722
Look at these gigantic windows.

1051
00:43:07.764 --> 00:43:09.515
I do look good in natural light.

1052
00:43:09.557 --> 00:43:11.059
You exhaust me.

1053
00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.202
Listen, if you want
your own independence,


1054
00:43:12.226 --> 00:43:13.686
you need your own place.

1055
00:43:13.728 --> 00:43:15.271
You two have a good shot.

1056
00:43:15.313 --> 00:43:17.065
They like renting
out to couples.


1057
00:43:18.483 --> 00:43:20.234
- Oh!
- You know what,


1058
00:43:20.276 --> 00:43:24.238
my little candy cane, they
like renting to couples.


1059
00:43:25.823 --> 00:43:26.783
I bet they do.

1060
00:43:26.824 --> 00:43:29.535
Yeah, my little pizza pocket.

1061
00:43:30.954 --> 00:43:33.790
Sir, actually, my
boyfriend and I,


1062
00:43:33.831 --> 00:43:35.434
this is my boyfriend.
She's my girlfriend.


1063
00:43:35.458 --> 00:43:37.502
Yeah. We would love

1064
00:43:38.503 --> 00:43:39.963
to spend our first
Christmas here.


1065
00:43:40.004 --> 00:43:41.965
- Yes. Yes.
- If that's at all possible.


1066
00:43:42.006 --> 00:43:44.133
Is there any way to speed
up the application process?


1067
00:43:44.175 --> 00:43:46.052
I'll see what I can do.

1068
00:43:46.094 --> 00:43:47.136
Thank you so much.

1069
00:43:47.178 --> 00:43:48.888
- Thank you.
- Thanks.


1070
00:43:49.847 --> 00:43:50.515
That was good.

1071
00:43:50.556 --> 00:43:51.683
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


1072
00:43:51.724 --> 00:43:52.725
Right?

1073
00:43:54.852 --> 00:43:56.354
- Yes.
- Cool.


1074
00:44:07.699 --> 00:44:08.825
Ow.

1075
00:44:08.866 --> 00:44:09.867
Okay.

1076
00:44:11.369 --> 00:44:13.121
Ow. Ow. Oh.

1077
00:44:13.162 --> 00:44:14.122
Oh, you.

1078
00:44:14.163 --> 00:44:15.623
Hi. Hi.

1079
00:44:15.665 --> 00:44:16.582
Gertie said that I
could use the kitchen.


1080
00:44:16.624 --> 00:44:17.583
Can I help you out?

1081
00:44:17.625 --> 00:44:19.002
Yeah, you really can.

1082
00:44:19.043 --> 00:44:21.129
And then I'm just
gonna leave. Okay.


1083
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:21.963
I'll come back. 
I'll come back.

1084
00:44:22.005 --> 00:44:23.673
Look at you.

1085
00:44:23.715 --> 00:44:25.693
Surprised little Miss Christmas
has a baking resolution.


1086
00:44:25.717 --> 00:44:28.678
Isn't this like standard
holiday practice for you?


1087
00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:31.764
Yeah, cookies and
gingerbread, absolutely.


1088
00:44:31.806 --> 00:44:33.349
This recipe of my
grandma's takes a lot


1089
00:44:33.391 --> 00:44:34.976
of time and attention.

1090
00:44:35.018 --> 00:44:36.370
And I always say I'm
gonna make it every year,


1091
00:44:36.394 --> 00:44:37.812
and then I get too busy, so...

1092
00:44:37.854 --> 00:44:39.415
Well, good luck. I
can't wait to try it.


1093
00:44:39.439 --> 00:44:40.791
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.


1094
00:44:40.815 --> 00:44:42.817
This recipe takes two people.

1095
00:44:42.859 --> 00:44:44.694
I pay people to bake my cakes.

1096
00:44:44.736 --> 00:44:46.362
Come on. It'll
be a good lesson.


1097
00:44:46.404 --> 00:44:47.196
Got all the ingredients.

1098
00:44:47.238 --> 00:44:48.364
It's super easy.

1099
00:44:48.406 --> 00:44:49.365
I am just missing one thing.

1100
00:44:49.407 --> 00:44:50.366
And what's that?

1101
00:44:50.408 --> 00:44:51.826
A lovely young man

1102
00:44:51.868 --> 00:44:54.203
with a wonderful sense
of Christmas spirit.


1103
00:44:54.245 --> 00:44:55.538
That's you.

1104
00:44:56.456 --> 00:44:57.665
Fine.

1105
00:45:17.936 --> 00:45:19.103
Hot.

1106
00:45:20.605 --> 00:45:22.023
Pretty good.

1107
00:45:33.493 --> 00:45:34.661
Spin that way.

1108
00:45:34.702 --> 00:45:35.703
Really good, really good.

1109
00:45:49.467 --> 00:45:52.011
Another one off the list.

1110
00:45:53.096 --> 00:45:55.932
Mm! Now I know why
the recipe is famous.


1111
00:45:55.974 --> 00:45:56.933
Right?

1112
00:45:56.975 --> 00:45:59.435
It's just like she made it.

1113
00:45:59.477 --> 00:46:02.772
It's funny how like
flavors and smells


1114
00:46:02.814 --> 00:46:04.941
can really remind you
of somebody, isn't it?


1115
00:46:05.984 --> 00:46:07.318
My family was really small,

1116
00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.861
so you'd think Christmas

1117
00:46:08.903 --> 00:46:10.446
should be really
quiet at our house,


1118
00:46:10.488 --> 00:46:13.324
but grandma wouldn't
stand for that.


1119
00:46:13.366 --> 00:46:15.702
Sounds a lot like my mom.

1120
00:46:15.743 --> 00:46:16.953
Was that her?

1121
00:46:16.995 --> 00:46:18.454
Yeah.

1122
00:46:18.496 --> 00:46:20.123
First day of college.

1123
00:46:20.164 --> 00:46:21.249
She was really proud.

1124
00:46:21.291 --> 00:46:22.166
What school'd you go to?

1125
00:46:22.208 --> 00:46:23.334
Harvard.

1126
00:46:23.376 --> 00:46:24.585
They let you into Harvard?

1127
00:46:26.087 --> 00:46:27.523
Wait, Mr. Can't Read a
Nine-Page Quality Report


1128
00:46:27.547 --> 00:46:29.257
went to Harvard?

1129
00:46:29.299 --> 00:46:30.484
Oh, believe it or not, I
used to be a real go-getter.


1130
00:46:30.508 --> 00:46:31.508
What happened?

1131
00:46:33.011 --> 00:46:34.971
Got tired of trying
to impress my old man.


1132
00:46:35.013 --> 00:46:36.014
Hm.

1133
00:46:36.055 --> 00:46:37.974
My dad was my idol growing up.

1134
00:46:38.016 --> 00:46:40.518
Wanted his approval
more than anything.


1135
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.979
So I figured if I won
first-place ribbons,


1136
00:46:43.021 --> 00:46:47.191
got good grades, went
to a great college...


1137
00:46:47.233 --> 00:46:48.233
I dunno.

1138
00:46:48.985 --> 00:46:49.985
What?

1139
00:46:51.446 --> 00:46:54.073
So my mom, she got sick
during summer break that year.


1140
00:46:54.115 --> 00:46:56.159
And after that,
my dad's approval


1141
00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.511
just didn't really
matter anymore.


1142
00:46:57.535 --> 00:46:59.203
So never went back.

1143
00:47:01.331 --> 00:47:03.541
Life's too short, you know?

1144
00:47:07.962 --> 00:47:08.963
What?

1145
00:47:10.089 --> 00:47:13.509
I don't know. This
could be nothing.


1146
00:47:13.551 --> 00:47:16.220
My dad just quit on us.

1147
00:47:16.262 --> 00:47:17.722
I don't know why.

1148
00:47:17.764 --> 00:47:18.991
Most of the time when
I think about it,


1149
00:47:19.015 --> 00:47:21.601
it makes me really,
really angry.


1150
00:47:21.643 --> 00:47:23.269
And then every year
around the holidays,


1151
00:47:23.311 --> 00:47:24.979
do you know what I do?

1152
00:47:25.021 --> 00:47:26.773
I think about what
it would be like


1153
00:47:26.814 --> 00:47:29.567
if we had one more
Christmas together.


1154
00:47:29.609 --> 00:47:33.112
Like that would
make any difference.


1155
00:47:33.154 --> 00:47:34.197
It's stupid.

1156
00:47:37.075 --> 00:47:39.535
Anyway, I know my
dad's not coming back,


1157
00:47:39.577 --> 00:47:41.287
but yours is here.

1158
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:45.041
And it just makes me
wonder if there's anything,


1159
00:47:45.083 --> 00:47:47.251
just if there's anything to
save in that relationship.


1160
00:47:47.293 --> 00:47:49.796
I'm not sure that's
possible at this point.


1161
00:47:49.837 --> 00:47:52.799
Ah, but nothing is impossible.

1162
00:47:54.926 --> 00:47:58.596
It's the magic of
Christmas, yeah?


1163
00:47:58.638 --> 00:48:00.556
Gertie's working
for you now, I see.


1164
00:48:00.598 --> 00:48:02.308
You better believe it.

1165
00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:04.227
What's the story with these?

1166
00:48:04.269 --> 00:48:06.980
Well, we used to make our
own ornaments for Christmas.


1167
00:48:07.021 --> 00:48:08.564
It was my mom's
favorite tradition.


1168
00:48:08.606 --> 00:48:10.275
Dad's too, actually.

1169
00:48:10.316 --> 00:48:12.068
They're very, very cute.

1170
00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:14.404
Those are pine cones we
gathered in Central Park.


1171
00:48:14.445 --> 00:48:16.285
Another year we went to
a glass-blowing studio,


1172
00:48:16.322 --> 00:48:18.700
learned how to make
snowflakes like that one.


1173
00:48:20.326 --> 00:48:23.579
Each decoration's tied
to a memory of my mom.


1174
00:48:23.621 --> 00:48:25.748
Do you still make
them with your dad?


1175
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:28.918
After she died, I guess
the tradition did too.


1176
00:48:31.296 --> 00:48:34.257
I appreciate what
you're trying to do,


1177
00:48:34.299 --> 00:48:38.177
but I'm not sure I
wanna go down that path.


1178
00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:42.974
Okay. I'm so sorry.

1179
00:48:44.767 --> 00:48:46.936
I understand, obviously.

1180
00:48:46.978 --> 00:48:49.105
Can I tell you what I
really want though, Kincaid?


1181
00:48:51.232 --> 00:48:52.232
Yeah.

1182
00:48:53.943 --> 00:48:56.738
More of this delicious wine.

1183
00:48:58.698 --> 00:48:59.782
Yeah, sure.

1184
00:48:59.824 --> 00:49:01.409
Okay.
Top up?


1185
00:49:01.451 --> 00:49:02.952
One, only one,

1186
00:49:02.994 --> 00:49:04.430
because I'm an athlete
in training, remember?


1187
00:49:04.454 --> 00:49:06.205
Athlete in training, right.

1188
00:49:06.247 --> 00:49:07.665
Mm-hm.

1189
00:49:07.707 --> 00:49:09.417
Everything in moderation, right?

1190
00:49:09.459 --> 00:49:11.419
Tonight we drink wine.

1191
00:49:12.253 --> 00:49:13.838
Tomorrow we run.

1192
00:49:14.922 --> 00:49:17.425
I was really onboard
until the last part.


1193
00:49:28.353 --> 00:49:29.646
Okay.

1194
00:49:32.398 --> 00:49:33.691
Not even close.

1195
00:49:33.733 --> 00:49:35.568
This race is in a week.

1196
00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:36.653
I'm gonna finish last.

1197
00:49:36.694 --> 00:49:38.237
You got advice there, coach?

1198
00:49:38.279 --> 00:49:39.840
Try it again, but
this time run faster.


1199
00:49:39.864 --> 00:49:41.616
That is not helpful.

1200
00:49:41.658 --> 00:49:43.719
Maybe what you need is a
proper kind of motivation.


1201
00:49:43.743 --> 00:49:44.845
That's great. I don't
know what that means.


1202
00:49:44.869 --> 00:49:46.788
Hold on a sec.

1203
00:49:46.829 --> 00:49:47.956
Hey, gang.

1204
00:49:47.997 --> 00:49:49.123
Oh my God.

1205
00:49:49.165 --> 00:49:50.708
Wanna make a few bucks, huh?

1206
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:51.584
Yeah!

1207
00:49:51.626 --> 00:49:52.669
Yeah?

1208
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:53.795
Every time she runs by,

1209
00:49:53.836 --> 00:49:55.171
I want you to hit her with

1210
00:49:55.213 --> 00:49:56.482
as many snowballs
as you possibly can.


1211
00:49:56.506 --> 00:49:57.340
Deal?

1212
00:49:57.382 --> 00:49:58.383
Yeah!

1213
00:50:00.885 --> 00:50:02.679
What was that about?

1214
00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:04.281
I told those kids every time
they hit you with a snowball,


1215
00:50:04.305 --> 00:50:05.390
they make a buck.

1216
00:50:05.431 --> 00:50:06.516
That's ridiculous.

1217
00:50:06.557 --> 00:50:08.017
They're not gonna do that.

1218
00:50:08.059 --> 00:50:09.620
You're not supposed
to be spending bucks.


1219
00:50:09.644 --> 00:50:11.145
You're supposed to
be saving money.


1220
00:50:11.187 --> 00:50:12.498
True. So you better
not let them catch you.


1221
00:50:12.522 --> 00:50:13.773
What?

1222
00:50:15.233 --> 00:50:16.401
Okay. Okay.

1223
00:50:20.071 --> 00:50:21.739
Pick your heels up.

1224
00:50:24.367 --> 00:50:26.244
Not bad, Kincaid.

1225
00:50:29.163 --> 00:50:30.432
I think they ran
outta snowballs.


1226
00:50:30.456 --> 00:50:31.457
I think I'm good.

1227
00:50:31.499 --> 00:50:32.750
Best pace so far.

1228
00:50:32.792 --> 00:50:34.210
See? I told you.

1229
00:50:34.252 --> 00:50:35.086
You just needed the
right kinda motivation.


1230
00:50:35.128 --> 00:50:35.545
Yes.

1231
00:50:35.586 --> 00:50:36.587
Ow.

1232
00:50:40.216 --> 00:50:41.443
Run, run, run, run, run, run.

1233
00:50:41.467 --> 00:50:42.927
Okay, running, running.

1234
00:50:42.969 --> 00:50:46.556
Well, at least you don't
owe the more money.


1235
00:50:51.978 --> 00:50:53.187
Jamie!
Hi!


1236
00:50:54.522 --> 00:50:55.315
Jamie!

1237
00:50:55.356 --> 00:50:56.899
Oh, hi!

1238
00:50:56.941 --> 00:50:58.419
Hi, I thought you were
coming home next week.


1239
00:50:58.443 --> 00:51:01.571
Oh, I know, but I
wanted to surprise you.


1240
00:51:01.613 --> 00:51:03.823
You look so chic.

1241
00:51:03.865 --> 00:51:04.741
Do you like it?

1242
00:51:04.782 --> 00:51:05.742
Tres European.

1243
00:51:05.783 --> 00:51:07.493
Thank you.

1244
00:51:07.535 --> 00:51:09.287
Oh, can you please
tell me that this means


1245
00:51:09.329 --> 00:51:11.247
that you hate it in Italy
and you're coming back


1246
00:51:11.289 --> 00:51:12.600
and you're never
gonna leave me again?


1247
00:51:12.624 --> 00:51:14.000
Ooh, not quite.

1248
00:51:14.042 --> 00:51:16.961
Okay, two words.
Francesco Ricofoliolo.


1249
00:51:17.003 --> 00:51:19.130
Okay. I'm assuming you're
not talking about wine.


1250
00:51:19.172 --> 00:51:20.465
No.

1251
00:51:20.506 --> 00:51:21.859
Okay. We have like so
much to catch up on.


1252
00:51:21.883 --> 00:51:24.594
- Yeah.
- Please, first. You go.


1253
00:51:24.636 --> 00:51:27.263
Oh, I found the perfect
fabric for that dress.


1254
00:51:27.305 --> 00:51:28.306
Did you?

1255
00:51:29.015 --> 00:51:29.891
Can't wait to see it.

1256
00:51:29.933 --> 00:51:30.808
I can show you.

1257
00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:31.684
Oh, please.

1258
00:51:31.726 --> 00:51:32.894
Allora, andiamo!

1259
00:51:32.936 --> 00:51:34.479
Buona Nutella.

1260
00:51:35.563 --> 00:51:36.874
It was like the most
irresponsible thing


1261
00:51:36.898 --> 00:51:38.316
that I've ever done,

1262
00:51:38.358 --> 00:51:40.068
but felt like the
most responsible thing


1263
00:51:40.109 --> 00:51:41.986
that I've ever done.

1264
00:51:42.028 --> 00:51:43.380
Who are you and what have
you done with my friend?


1265
00:51:43.404 --> 00:51:44.798
It was like, I had
this sudden rush.


1266
00:51:44.822 --> 00:51:45.925
I mean, technically I was fired.

1267
00:51:45.949 --> 00:51:47.283
And everybody knows.

1268
00:51:47.325 --> 00:51:49.494
Yeah, everybody knows.
Except for my mom.


1269
00:51:49.535 --> 00:51:51.371
You were fired?

1270
00:51:53.414 --> 00:51:54.832
Yeah.

1271
00:51:54.874 --> 00:51:55.833
I was gonna talk to
you about it, Mom.


1272
00:51:55.875 --> 00:51:57.460
I was just leaving.

1273
00:51:57.502 --> 00:51:59.545
Thank you again for
the candle, Millie.


1274
00:51:59.587 --> 00:52:00.964
It's nice to see you, Jamie.

1275
00:52:01.005 --> 00:52:02.298
I'll leave you both to catch up.

1276
00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:03.716
Mom, can you stay please?

1277
00:52:03.758 --> 00:52:05.218
Oh, it's fine.

1278
00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:07.220
I have lots to do
before the toy drive.


1279
00:52:17.605 --> 00:52:20.024
At the Ho
-Ho Hotel.

1280
00:52:20.066 --> 00:52:21.901
Kind of funny? 
Sort of funny?

1281
00:52:21.943 --> 00:52:23.778
Not funny.

1282
00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:25.381
All right, well I just wanted
to say have a great Christmas


1283
00:52:25.405 --> 00:52:27.740
and we'll see you all
after the holidays.


1284
00:52:27.782 --> 00:52:28.782
Great work.

1285
00:52:31.452 --> 00:52:32.745
Happy holidays.

1286
00:52:32.787 --> 00:52:33.913
Merry Christmas.

1287
00:52:33.955 --> 00:52:35.290
Happy holidays.

1288
00:52:35.331 --> 00:52:37.583
Merry Christmas to you.

1289
00:52:37.625 --> 00:52:39.294
Say hi to Nancy.

1290
00:52:39.335 --> 00:52:40.295
Where's everybody going?

1291
00:52:40.336 --> 00:52:41.963
It's only one o'clock.

1292
00:52:42.005 --> 00:52:43.065
I need those year-end
reports on my desk.


1293
00:52:43.089 --> 00:52:45.300
How about in your hand?

1294
00:52:46.634 --> 00:52:50.305
Turns out a little bit of
effort goes a long way.


1295
00:52:50.346 --> 00:52:54.767
Plus my team worked really
hard, so let 'em off early.


1296
00:52:54.809 --> 00:52:56.853
I hope that's okay.

1297
00:52:56.894 --> 00:52:59.230
I think everyone
deserves more time


1298
00:52:59.272 --> 00:53:01.774
with their family and friends.

1299
00:53:01.816 --> 00:53:02.817
I agree.

1300
00:53:04.277 --> 00:53:07.280
Well, Merry Christmas, Dad.

1301
00:53:07.322 --> 00:53:09.240
Merry Christmas.

1302
00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:16.331
Sandalwood and orange zest

1303
00:53:16.372 --> 00:53:18.207
for anxiety and stress.

1304
00:53:18.249 --> 00:53:20.168
Thanks, Millie.

1305
00:53:20.209 --> 00:53:24.088
Your mama just needs
some time, sweetheart.


1306
00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:25.465
Don't worry.

1307
00:53:25.506 --> 00:53:26.507
Okay.

1308
00:53:32.013 --> 00:53:33.264
Hi.

1309
00:53:33.306 --> 00:53:35.642
Meet me in Queens two hours.

1310
00:53:35.683 --> 00:53:36.684
No, I can't.

1311
00:53:36.726 --> 00:53:37.560
My friend Jamie's here.

1312
00:53:37.602 --> 00:53:39.270
Bring her.

1313
00:53:39.312 --> 00:53:41.152
Just put on something
red and green and meet me


1314
00:53:41.189 --> 00:53:42.708
at the Blessed Sacrament
Church in Jackson Heights.


1315
00:53:42.732 --> 00:53:45.276
Wyatt, I've had a
really long day, okay?


1316
00:53:45.318 --> 00:53:46.611
Say yes to adventure, right?

1317
00:53:46.653 --> 00:53:48.988
Well, this is an
adventure, Kincaid.


1318
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:50.698
Come on. Trust me.

1319
00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:52.033
It'll be worth it.

1320
00:54:02.043 --> 00:54:04.128
You guys made it just in time.

1321
00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:05.338
For what?

1322
00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:07.590
Uncle Wyatt, it's gonna start

1323
00:54:07.632 --> 00:54:09.384
Uncle Wyatt?

1324
00:54:09.425 --> 00:54:12.845
This is Kendra, Brad, and
this little love bug is Olivia.


1325
00:54:12.887 --> 00:54:14.305
- Hi.
- Hello.


1326
00:54:14.347 --> 00:54:15.491
So glad you guys could make it.

1327
00:54:15.515 --> 00:54:16.683
Hey, we better get walking.

1328
00:54:16.724 --> 00:54:17.934
Walking?

1329
00:54:17.976 --> 00:54:19.477
Walking where?

1330
00:54:19.519 --> 00:54:21.896
This is the Jackson
Heights Sing and Stroll.


1331
00:54:21.938 --> 00:54:23.690
We walk around the neighborhood

1332
00:54:23.731 --> 00:54:25.960
and sing holiday songs from
different languages and faiths.


1333
00:54:25.984 --> 00:54:27.068
We're going caroling?

1334
00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:28.569
Yeah.

1335
00:54:28.611 --> 00:54:30.238
This is not your
usual debauchery.


1336
00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.948
I know. I used to
do it all the time.


1337
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:33.491
I thought this

1338
00:54:33.533 --> 00:54:34.843
would be an adventure
you wouldn't wanna miss.


1339
00:54:34.867 --> 00:54:36.411
It's exactly what I needed.

1340
00:54:36.452 --> 00:54:37.870
Hi, I will explain this later.

1341
00:54:37.912 --> 00:54:39.539
Wyatt, Jamie. Jamie, Wyatt.

1342
00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.350
Oh, you're the one that
stole my best friend's job.


1343
00:54:41.374 --> 00:54:43.418
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1344
00:54:44.043 --> 00:54:45.086
Okay, Mr. Grinch.

1345
00:54:45.128 --> 00:54:46.963
Show us how this works.

1346
00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:43.227
I did not realize that Wyatt
has friends who are normal.


1347
00:55:43.269 --> 00:55:44.395
What do you mean?

1348
00:55:44.437 --> 00:55:46.189
I think she means guys

1349
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:47.910
that aren't up-and-coming
DJs or tech bros.


1350
00:55:47.941 --> 00:55:51.611
Yes. Also, you haven't
mentioned owning a yacht yet.


1351
00:55:51.653 --> 00:55:53.446
I see you've met the new crowd.

1352
00:55:53.488 --> 00:55:55.365
Hmm? New crowd?

1353
00:55:55.406 --> 00:55:56.508
That's who we call the people
Wyatt started hanging out


1354
00:55:56.532 --> 00:55:58.159
with after his mom passed.

1355
00:55:58.201 --> 00:55:59.911
Oh.

1356
00:55:59.953 --> 00:56:01.513
Look, Brad and I have
known him since we were kids,


1357
00:56:01.537 --> 00:56:04.290
and parties, the whole
like rich boy attitude,


1358
00:56:04.332 --> 00:56:05.500
that's not the real Wyatt.

1359
00:56:05.541 --> 00:56:06.584
Huh.

1360
00:56:08.002 --> 00:56:09.188
Liv, go ask your mom what
she wants to eat, okay?


1361
00:56:09.212 --> 00:56:10.212
Okay.

1362
00:56:12.799 --> 00:56:15.093
Can't believe how
big she's gotten.


1363
00:56:15.134 --> 00:56:17.178
You have no idea how
excited she was to see you.


1364
00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.888
Yeah?

1365
00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:20.306
Look, I'm sorry man.

1366
00:56:20.348 --> 00:56:22.684
I really should
come by more often.


1367
00:56:22.725 --> 00:56:25.228
I just get caught up, you know?

1368
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:28.189
I'm really having
a good time though.


1369
00:56:28.231 --> 00:56:29.941
Wow.

1370
00:56:29.983 --> 00:56:32.819
So this holiday self-help
pact is really working out?


1371
00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:34.529
I don't know.

1372
00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:36.507
I mean, it's supposed to
be to get free of my dad,


1373
00:56:36.531 --> 00:56:38.908
but Carley seems to think I
should patch things up with him.


1374
00:56:40.243 --> 00:56:41.452
Smart woman that Carley.

1375
00:56:41.494 --> 00:56:42.954
I think she's a keeper.

1376
00:56:42.996 --> 00:56:45.039
How many times have
I told you, Kendra?


1377
00:56:45.081 --> 00:56:46.833
We're just friends.

1378
00:56:46.874 --> 00:56:49.919
Didn't we agree to
be just friends once?


1379
00:56:49.961 --> 00:56:51.504
Still are, baby cakes.

1380
00:56:54.507 --> 00:56:57.260
I forgot how gross you two are.

1381
00:56:57.302 --> 00:56:58.803
Ew.

1382
00:56:59.721 --> 00:57:00.763
What?

1383
00:57:02.223 --> 00:57:03.891
You've changed.

1384
00:57:05.476 --> 00:57:06.870
I mean, I'm wearing my hair
a little bit differently.


1385
00:57:06.894 --> 00:57:09.314
No, no, no, no.
That's not what I mean.


1386
00:57:09.355 --> 00:57:10.982
I don't know.

1387
00:57:11.024 --> 00:57:12.501
I think there's just
something different about you.


1388
00:57:12.525 --> 00:57:15.612
You're more confident
and vibrant.


1389
00:57:16.904 --> 00:57:18.448
Thanks.

1390
00:57:18.489 --> 00:57:22.118
I have been focusing
on reinventing myself.


1391
00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:23.536
I have.

1392
00:57:23.578 --> 00:57:25.246
And actually, it's
all thanks to you


1393
00:57:25.288 --> 00:57:28.207
because my resolution
list has been achieved.


1394
00:57:28.249 --> 00:57:29.375
I'm so happy to hear that.

1395
00:57:29.417 --> 00:57:30.251
Go resolutions.

1396
00:57:30.293 --> 00:57:31.461
Yeah.

1397
00:57:31.502 --> 00:57:32.962
Sorry to interrupt you, Jamie.

1398
00:57:33.004 --> 00:57:34.648
Can I borrow Miss Kincaid
for like a minute?


1399
00:57:34.672 --> 00:57:36.132
- Take her.
- Yeah?


1400
00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:40.261
You know, I gotta
hand it to you.


1401
00:57:40.303 --> 00:57:41.405
When you invited us down here,

1402
00:57:41.429 --> 00:57:43.222
I did not know what to expect.

1403
00:57:43.264 --> 00:57:44.283
Told you I'm full of surprises.

1404
00:57:44.307 --> 00:57:45.350
Noted.

1405
00:57:46.392 --> 00:57:47.352
Your friends are great.

1406
00:57:47.393 --> 00:57:48.561
Yeah, they are.

1407
00:57:48.603 --> 00:57:50.146
They're a pretty great family.

1408
00:57:50.188 --> 00:57:52.523
But let's get down to business.

1409
00:57:52.565 --> 00:57:54.943
I told the kids you'd read
'em a Christmas story.


1410
00:57:54.984 --> 00:57:56.736
No. No. Why?

1411
00:57:56.778 --> 00:57:57.695
You're never gonna finish
"War and Peace," Kincaid.


1412
00:57:57.737 --> 00:57:58.947
I might.

1413
00:57:58.988 --> 00:58:00.865
Not every resolution
has to be hard.


1414
00:58:00.907 --> 00:58:02.116
Oh, well...

1415
00:58:03.368 --> 00:58:05.745
Everything okay?

1416
00:58:05.787 --> 00:58:06.746
It's nothing.

1417
00:58:06.788 --> 00:58:07.914
My dad used to read me this.

1418
00:58:07.956 --> 00:58:08.998
Oh, I'm sorry.

1419
00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:09.958
We can pick something else.

1420
00:58:09.999 --> 00:58:11.584
No, that's okay.

1421
00:58:12.293 --> 00:58:13.169
That's okay. I wanna do it.

1422
00:58:13.211 --> 00:58:14.170
Yeah?

1423
00:58:14.212 --> 00:58:15.213
Yeah.

1424
00:58:16.756 --> 00:58:17.756
Yeah.

1425
00:58:19.509 --> 00:58:21.636
"So much so that she could
sit quietly and not play,


1426
00:58:21.678 --> 00:58:24.430
and they at last
called her a dreamer.


1427
00:58:24.472 --> 00:58:27.183
Yes, in the merry Christmastime,

1428
00:58:27.225 --> 00:58:29.686
children dream wonderful things.

1429
00:58:29.727 --> 00:58:32.814
And beautiful dreams
are also fairytales.


1430
00:58:32.855 --> 00:58:35.817
As is this one of the Nutcracker

1431
00:58:36.901 --> 00:58:38.736
and the Mouse King."

1432
00:58:43.241 --> 00:58:44.951
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1433
00:58:44.993 --> 00:58:46.619
I will pass that along.

1434
00:58:46.661 --> 00:58:49.122
Oh my girlfriend is
gonna be so excited.


1435
00:58:49.163 --> 00:58:50.123
I will let her know.

1436
00:58:50.164 --> 00:58:51.124
She will be so happy.

1437
00:58:51.165 --> 00:58:53.126
Thank you so much!

1438
00:58:53.167 --> 00:58:54.127
You just got a girlfriend?

1439
00:58:54.168 --> 00:58:55.962
Who's your girlfriend?

1440
00:58:56.004 --> 00:58:57.398
That was the landlord. I was
talking about the apartment.


1441
00:58:57.422 --> 00:58:58.923
I just got my
application approved.


1442
00:58:58.965 --> 00:59:00.633
Wait, you got it?

1443
00:59:00.675 --> 00:59:02.152
That's right, my little
snow angel. I got it!


1444
00:59:02.176 --> 00:59:03.136
It's a good gig!

1445
00:59:03.177 --> 00:59:04.304
We got it.

1446
00:59:04.345 --> 00:59:05.805
Congratulations!

1447
00:59:07.098 --> 00:59:08.391
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

1448
00:59:08.433 --> 00:59:09.726
I'm proud of us.

1449
00:59:09.767 --> 00:59:11.644
That means that I'm now an adult

1450
00:59:11.686 --> 00:59:13.396
and you can check off
one more resolution.


1451
00:59:13.438 --> 00:59:14.772
Yes I can.

1452
00:59:15.690 --> 00:59:16.733
Nice.

1453
00:59:18.067 --> 00:59:19.902
One more. One more.

1454
00:59:26.701 --> 00:59:28.578
I'm quite busy right now.

1455
00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:31.998
I'll be quick. Just
wanted to give you these.


1456
00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:32.915
Your house keys?

1457
00:59:32.957 --> 00:59:34.125
Yeah.

1458
00:59:34.167 --> 00:59:35.126
Are you going somewhere?

1459
00:59:35.168 --> 00:59:36.753
Got my own place.

1460
00:59:38.796 --> 00:59:41.924
I know you don't think I can
take care of myself, but...


1461
00:59:41.966 --> 00:59:43.009
Where?

1462
00:59:43.051 --> 00:59:44.093
Queens.

1463
00:59:45.553 --> 00:59:49.015
Your mom and I shared our
first apartment in Queens.


1464
00:59:49.057 --> 00:59:49.933
Really?

1465
00:59:49.974 --> 00:59:50.600
Yeah.

1466
00:59:50.642 --> 00:59:52.226
It was a dump.

1467
00:59:52.268 --> 00:59:55.271
Spent a whole week
cleaning mold off the tile.


1468
00:59:55.313 --> 00:59:58.942
But there is something special
about having your own space.


1469
00:59:58.983 --> 01:00:01.361
Hard to picture
you scrubbing floors.


1470
01:00:01.402 --> 01:00:03.404
It was a different time.

1471
01:00:08.576 --> 01:00:10.328
Well, I better...

1472
01:00:11.663 --> 01:00:14.040
Oh, Wyatt, your report.

1473
01:00:15.917 --> 01:00:17.001
Nice work.

1474
01:00:18.461 --> 01:00:19.712
Thanks.

1475
01:00:30.014 --> 01:00:30.932
Buongiorno.

1476
01:00:30.974 --> 01:00:31.992
Hello, my little snowflake.

1477
01:00:32.016 --> 01:00:33.142
Come on in.

1478
01:00:33.935 --> 01:00:35.311
How do you like our new place?

1479
01:00:35.353 --> 01:00:37.814
Oh, you did such a great job.

1480
01:00:37.855 --> 01:00:39.941
Ooh, did someone
get me a present?


1481
01:00:39.983 --> 01:00:41.567
Oh yeah.

1482
01:00:41.609 --> 01:00:44.696
This is just a little
housewarming for you.


1483
01:00:46.197 --> 01:00:47.198
A coffee maker?

1484
01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.408
Mm-hm.

1485
01:00:48.449 --> 01:00:49.826
It's not as fancy as your dad's,

1486
01:00:49.867 --> 01:00:50.660
but maybe you can
actually use it.


1487
01:00:50.702 --> 01:00:51.411
It's perfect.

1488
01:00:51.452 --> 01:00:52.452
Good.

1489
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:54.247
You know, I gotta say,

1490
01:00:54.289 --> 01:00:56.749
I do feel like it's
missing something.


1491
01:00:56.791 --> 01:00:57.792
Like what?

1492
01:00:57.834 --> 01:00:58.960
I don't know.

1493
01:00:59.002 --> 01:01:01.671
Some kinda little festive touch.

1494
01:01:01.713 --> 01:01:03.881
Maybe something German.

1495
01:01:06.175 --> 01:01:07.302
Special delivery!

1496
01:01:07.343 --> 01:01:08.344
Gertie?

1497
01:01:09.846 --> 01:01:11.490
There are a lot more of
these downstairs, yeah.


1498
01:01:11.514 --> 01:01:12.849
More what?

1499
01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:15.143
Well, my little candy cane,

1500
01:01:15.184 --> 01:01:19.439
we are going to decorate your
house today all by ourselves.


1501
01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.690
I dunno.

1502
01:01:20.732 --> 01:01:21.917
Are we sure about that?
Mmhm.


1503
01:01:21.941 --> 01:01:23.610
There's more downstairs.

1504
01:01:23.651 --> 01:01:24.986
- And you want me to...
- I do.


1505
01:01:25.028 --> 01:01:26.571
- Okay.
- Yeah. Thanks.


1506
01:01:44.589 --> 01:01:45.629
Stand it up. There you go.

1507
01:02:17.038 --> 01:02:19.499
I can't believe you
found the exact same one.


1508
01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:21.000
Yeah. It's not
like it was hard.


1509
01:02:21.042 --> 01:02:23.461
I left my dignity
right beside it.


1510
01:02:25.046 --> 01:02:27.924
Wyatt, I was wondering if maybe

1511
01:02:31.094 --> 01:02:35.640
these have been in storage
for a little bit too long.


1512
01:02:35.682 --> 01:02:36.724
Kincaid, I don't know.

1513
01:02:36.766 --> 01:02:37.725
I know, I know, I know.

1514
01:02:37.767 --> 01:02:39.602
I get it.

1515
01:02:39.644 --> 01:02:42.772
You could think of it as part
of your training if you want.


1516
01:02:42.814 --> 01:02:46.359
Because right now
this is a house,


1517
01:02:46.401 --> 01:02:48.861
and you need a home, right?

1518
01:02:49.946 --> 01:02:51.781
Homes are filled with memories

1519
01:02:51.823 --> 01:02:53.366
and they're filled
with traditions.


1520
01:02:53.408 --> 01:02:55.201
And we do have a box

1521
01:02:57.495 --> 01:02:59.330
of those right here.

1522
01:03:06.671 --> 01:03:08.089
There we go.

1523
01:03:09.424 --> 01:03:10.842
Pretty good.

1524
01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:15.138
Forgot how warm Christmas
can make you feel,


1525
01:03:15.179 --> 01:03:18.558
so connected to the
people you love.


1526
01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.310
Yeah.

1527
01:03:20.351 --> 01:03:23.104
Speaking of which, how's
things with your mom?


1528
01:03:23.146 --> 01:03:26.482
She's still not talking to me.

1529
01:03:26.524 --> 01:03:27.942
I feel so stupid.

1530
01:03:27.984 --> 01:03:29.652
I was so focused
on self-improvement


1531
01:03:29.694 --> 01:03:31.362
and I disappointed somebody

1532
01:03:31.404 --> 01:03:33.823
who has always loved me
exactly the way that I am.


1533
01:03:33.865 --> 01:03:34.824
Well, she's not gone.

1534
01:03:34.866 --> 01:03:35.783
You know that, right?

1535
01:03:35.825 --> 01:03:37.368
She's just angry.

1536
01:03:39.537 --> 01:03:40.997
Maybe. Yeah.

1537
01:03:41.539 --> 01:03:43.333
Ooh, guess what?

1538
01:03:44.459 --> 01:03:46.377
Only four more to go.

1539
01:03:46.419 --> 01:03:48.546
Oh, okay. Lay it on me.

1540
01:03:49.339 --> 01:03:51.132
Take up running

1541
01:03:51.174 --> 01:03:52.508
That race is tomorrow, isn't it?

1542
01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:53.301
Yeah. You're gonna do great.

1543
01:03:53.343 --> 01:03:54.344
Oh, okay.

1544
01:03:54.385 --> 01:03:55.845
Upgrade sewing skills?

1545
01:03:55.887 --> 01:03:56.596
I think I can finish
that dress tonight.


1546
01:03:56.638 --> 01:03:57.639
Absolutely.

1547
01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:59.349
Follow your dreams.

1548
01:03:59.390 --> 01:04:00.350
Finish dress.

1549
01:04:00.391 --> 01:04:01.517
Take pictures of dress.

1550
01:04:01.559 --> 01:04:02.703
Add dress pictures to sketches.

1551
01:04:02.727 --> 01:04:04.854
Send portfolio to designers.

1552
01:04:04.896 --> 01:04:06.814
- Like a boss.
- Yes.


1553
01:04:06.856 --> 01:04:08.399
Say yes to adventure.

1554
01:04:08.441 --> 01:04:10.210
How come you haven't ticked
that one off the list?


1555
01:04:10.234 --> 01:04:11.986
I don't know.

1556
01:04:12.028 --> 01:04:13.464
Maybe I haven't had one
that feels big enough yet.


1557
01:04:13.488 --> 01:04:15.073
Nothing easy, huh?

1558
01:04:15.114 --> 01:04:15.907
No.

1559
01:04:15.949 --> 01:04:17.867
Know what I think?

1560
01:04:17.909 --> 01:04:19.994
You're actually
gonna get this done.


1561
01:04:20.036 --> 01:04:21.496
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


1562
01:04:21.537 --> 01:04:22.580
Okay.

1563
01:04:25.583 --> 01:04:28.336
You know that I wouldn't
have made it this far at all


1564
01:04:28.378 --> 01:04:29.879
without you, right?

1565
01:04:38.137 --> 01:04:39.639
You wanna get that?

1566
01:04:39.681 --> 01:04:40.681
Yeah.

1567
01:04:45.937 --> 01:04:49.065
Dad, what are you doing here?

1568
01:04:49.107 --> 01:04:51.067
Carley sent me your new address

1569
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:53.736
and suggested I
might wanna stop by.


1570
01:04:53.778 --> 01:04:55.071
Come on in.

1571
01:04:58.157 --> 01:05:01.661
Ms. Kincaid, it's a
pleasure to see you again.


1572
01:05:01.703 --> 01:05:03.454
It's nice to see you too, sir.

1573
01:05:03.496 --> 01:05:05.331
Well, this is nice.

1574
01:05:07.875 --> 01:05:09.085
It's cozy.

1575
01:05:10.336 --> 01:05:11.629
Feels very you.

1576
01:05:12.922 --> 01:05:15.258
Yeah. Do you want a tour?

1577
01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.760
I mean, it'll be short, but
I can try to spice it up.


1578
01:05:17.802 --> 01:05:19.262
I would love one.

1579
01:05:19.304 --> 01:05:22.557
Okay. Well, tree
is kind of stop one.


1580
01:05:26.477 --> 01:05:29.022
Is that the ornament
we made during...


1581
01:05:29.063 --> 01:05:30.940
Blizzard? Yeah.

1582
01:05:30.982 --> 01:05:33.818
Remember this one from
that Christmas in Florida?


1583
01:05:34.986 --> 01:05:37.655
I haven't seen these in ages.

1584
01:05:39.157 --> 01:05:41.034
Your mother loved this one.

1585
01:05:43.077 --> 01:05:46.623
Why'd you suddenly
decide to hang them?


1586
01:05:47.874 --> 01:05:50.209
Tradition shouldn't
be kept in a box,


1587
01:05:50.251 --> 01:05:52.086
but I can't take any credit.

1588
01:05:52.128 --> 01:05:54.714
It was literally all Carley.

1589
01:06:11.981 --> 01:06:13.149
Hi.

1590
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:16.170
Is what you've been working on

1591
01:06:16.194 --> 01:06:18.488
since you quit your job?

1592
01:06:20.031 --> 01:06:22.075
Among other things.

1593
01:06:24.827 --> 01:06:26.746
It's beautiful, honey.

1594
01:06:31.584 --> 01:06:33.044
I'm sorry.

1595
01:06:33.086 --> 01:06:35.838
I'm really sorry that
I didn't tell you.


1596
01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.674
Why didn't you?

1597
01:06:37.715 --> 01:06:38.841
I don't know, Mom.

1598
01:06:38.883 --> 01:06:40.468
I felt bad.

1599
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:42.887
I feel like you've
sacrificed so much for me


1600
01:06:42.929 --> 01:06:44.031
so that I didn't
have to struggle


1601
01:06:44.055 --> 01:06:45.181
the way that you struggled.

1602
01:06:45.223 --> 01:06:46.599
And now I'm messing it up

1603
01:06:46.641 --> 01:06:48.518
and I'm throwing it
away on something


1604
01:06:48.559 --> 01:06:52.021
that I should have grown out
of probably like ages ago.


1605
01:06:52.063 --> 01:06:53.332
I didn't make all
those sacrifices


1606
01:06:53.356 --> 01:06:55.024
so that my daughter
could grow up


1607
01:06:55.066 --> 01:06:58.069
to be unfulfilled
and uninspired.


1608
01:06:59.404 --> 01:07:02.490
I made them so that you
could grow up to be free.


1609
01:07:02.532 --> 01:07:05.660
Free to follow your dreams
wherever they might lead.


1610
01:07:23.886 --> 01:07:25.155
Checking in for Carley Kincaid.

1611
01:07:25.179 --> 01:07:26.306
Oh, just in time.

1612
01:07:26.347 --> 01:07:28.975
The race starts in five minutes.

1613
01:07:29.017 --> 01:07:30.643
I don't think I can do this.

1614
01:07:30.685 --> 01:07:32.145
She's right.

1615
01:07:32.186 --> 01:07:33.247
Every racer needs
to have a costume.


1616
01:07:33.271 --> 01:07:34.439
- Got one.
- What?


1617
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.898
No, no, no. I'm not ready.

1618
01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:37.025
No, you are.

1619
01:07:37.066 --> 01:07:38.109
You just think you aren't.

1620
01:07:38.151 --> 01:07:39.360
Trust me.

1621
01:07:39.402 --> 01:07:41.154
Whether it's a tight deadline

1622
01:07:41.195 --> 01:07:42.739
or a snowball fight with kids,

1623
01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:45.325
makes no difference
for Carley Kincaid.


1624
01:07:45.366 --> 01:07:48.328
When the pressure's on,
you always come through.


1625
01:07:48.369 --> 01:07:50.246
So I want you to get out there

1626
01:07:50.288 --> 01:07:52.832
and show those North Pole
nobodies who you really are!


1627
01:07:57.879 --> 01:07:59.172
Gimme that costume.

1628
01:08:19.817 --> 01:08:21.319
On your mark,

1629
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:23.237
get set,

1630
01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:26.741
go!

1631
01:08:28.201 --> 01:08:29.577
Come on, Kincaid!

1632
01:08:29.619 --> 01:08:32.246
Give us a little
Christmas spirit!


1633
01:08:32.914 --> 01:08:33.998
Go!

1634
01:08:34.916 --> 01:08:35.875
Go, go, go, go, go!

1635
01:08:35.917 --> 01:08:37.460
Good! Yes!

1636
01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.219
Happy holidays.

1637
01:08:47.262 --> 01:08:48.721
Feliz Navidad.

1638
01:08:52.141 --> 01:08:54.811
- Timber!
- Oh my God.


1639
01:08:54.852 --> 01:08:55.979
Are you okay?

1640
01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:56.896
What are you doing, Kincaid?

1641
01:08:56.938 --> 01:08:57.981
Run the other way.

1642
01:08:58.022 --> 01:08:59.357
Did you hurt yourself?

1643
01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:00.984
I'm okay. I'll
catch up. Go ahead.


1644
01:09:01.025 --> 01:09:01.734
Leave the tree.
Leave the tree.


1645
01:09:01.776 --> 01:09:02.568
Go. Go.

1646
01:09:02.610 --> 01:09:03.319
Okay. Okay.

1647
01:09:03.361 --> 01:09:04.821
That's my girl!

1648
01:09:04.862 --> 01:09:07.282
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1649
01:09:07.323 --> 01:09:09.492
Didn't get limber, went timber.

1650
01:09:13.371 --> 01:09:15.665
Merry Christmas, Santa.

1651
01:09:16.624 --> 01:09:18.084
Happy holidays.

1652
01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.641
No!

1653
01:09:41.482 --> 01:09:42.900
Yes!

1654
01:09:42.942 --> 01:09:43.985
Yes!

1655
01:09:51.367 --> 01:09:53.137
- I won! I won!
- I knew you were gonna do it.


1656
01:09:53.161 --> 01:09:54.454
Yes, yes.

1657
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:56.831
Yes!

1658
01:09:57.582 --> 01:09:59.042
Woo!

1659
01:09:59.083 --> 01:10:00.168
I need to sit.

1660
01:10:00.209 --> 01:10:01.294
That was good. You sit.

1661
01:10:01.336 --> 01:10:02.253
- I'm gonna sit.
- Let's sit.


1662
01:10:02.295 --> 01:10:03.630
Whoo.

1663
01:10:09.636 --> 01:10:11.846
Maybe a little bit
to the left, Jamie.


1664
01:10:11.888 --> 01:10:13.449
So when you say you
and Wyatt are friends,


1665
01:10:13.473 --> 01:10:14.575
you guys like friends-friends?

1666
01:10:14.599 --> 01:10:15.975
Or are you guys like friends?

1667
01:10:16.017 --> 01:10:16.935
Exactly.

1668
01:10:16.976 --> 01:10:17.936
I'm confused.

1669
01:10:17.977 --> 01:10:20.396
No, back where it was.

1670
01:10:20.438 --> 01:10:21.856
The light's better.

1671
01:10:21.898 --> 01:10:23.208
Do you want us to
spell it out for you?


1672
01:10:23.232 --> 01:10:24.984
What?

1673
01:10:25.026 --> 01:10:28.154
Carley, I love you, but if
you don't scoop him up, I will.


1674
01:10:28.196 --> 01:10:29.715
It does have to be
back over there, Jamie.


1675
01:10:29.739 --> 01:10:30.740
I'm sorry.

1676
01:10:30.782 --> 01:10:32.158
I love you too.

1677
01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.660
But if you don't
take this picture,


1678
01:10:33.701 --> 01:10:34.845
I'm gonna be on the
next plane to Italy.


1679
01:10:34.869 --> 01:10:36.537
I know, I know.

1680
01:10:36.579 --> 01:10:38.182
I'm trying to get the
light right on the fabric.


1681
01:10:38.206 --> 01:10:39.516
It's supposed to
kinda drape and twirl.


1682
01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:41.209
Can you just fluff
it out a bit more?


1683
01:10:41.250 --> 01:10:42.890
Oh, this is totally
not about the dress.


1684
01:10:42.919 --> 01:10:44.879
This is about you
being in your head


1685
01:10:44.921 --> 01:10:46.965
because Wyatt has
feelings for you.


1686
01:10:47.006 --> 01:10:48.174
It wasn't part of the deal.

1687
01:10:48.216 --> 01:10:49.592
Can you keep fluffing it out?

1688
01:10:49.634 --> 01:10:52.512
Sounds like a bonus to me.

1689
01:10:52.553 --> 01:10:54.347
Do you have
feelings for him too?


1690
01:10:54.389 --> 01:10:56.557
No. I don't know. No.

1691
01:10:56.599 --> 01:10:58.351
Yes. Some. There are some.

1692
01:10:58.393 --> 01:11:00.395
He makes me laugh
and that's nice.


1693
01:11:00.436 --> 01:11:02.188
And he makes me feel
confident in ways


1694
01:11:02.230 --> 01:11:03.707
that I'm not used
to feeling confident


1695
01:11:03.731 --> 01:11:05.042
and, you know, like it
doesn't hurt that he's-


1696
01:11:05.066 --> 01:11:06.192
- Smoking.

1697
01:11:06.234 --> 01:11:07.443
I was gonna say handsome.

1698
01:11:07.485 --> 01:11:08.444
I dunno if I'd call him smoking.

1699
01:11:08.486 --> 01:11:09.612
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1700
01:11:09.654 --> 01:11:10.863
Oh my gosh, Jamie, Jamie.

1701
01:11:10.905 --> 01:11:11.990
Put it out. Put it out.

1702
01:11:12.031 --> 01:11:13.366
It's on the candle. Put it out!

1703
01:11:21.249 --> 01:11:23.376
Oh, Carley. I'm so sorry.

1704
01:11:23.418 --> 01:11:25.545
It's not your fault.

1705
01:11:26.629 --> 01:11:29.799
I was so close to
checking this one off.


1706
01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:37.056
Hi.

1707
01:11:37.098 --> 01:11:38.516
- Hey.
- Hey. Sorry.


1708
01:11:38.558 --> 01:11:39.350
I could've come up.

1709
01:11:39.392 --> 01:11:40.935
No, it's okay.

1710
01:11:40.977 --> 01:11:42.687
It's okay.

1711
01:11:42.729 --> 01:11:44.649
So, turns out gold medals
aren't really a thing


1712
01:11:44.689 --> 01:11:48.026
at the Christmas 5K, but thought
you should have one anyway.


1713
01:11:48.067 --> 01:11:49.067
Oh!

1714
01:11:50.111 --> 01:11:51.362
What did you do?

1715
01:11:55.158 --> 01:11:56.826
Wyatt, this is really sweet.

1716
01:11:56.868 --> 01:11:58.453
It's nothing.

1717
01:11:58.494 --> 01:12:00.872
Thank you. Thanks.

1718
01:12:00.913 --> 01:12:02.749
So I know it's
Christmas Eve and all,


1719
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:06.127
but I was wondering if you
would wanna go to an event


1720
01:12:06.169 --> 01:12:08.713
with me tonight as my date.

1721
01:12:10.965 --> 01:12:11.966
I can't.

1722
01:12:13.134 --> 01:12:14.010
Right.

1723
01:12:14.052 --> 01:12:15.595
Totally get it.

1724
01:12:15.637 --> 01:12:16.989
No, no, no, no, no.
Like I can't, I can't.


1725
01:12:17.013 --> 01:12:18.324
I have to help my mom
with the toy drive.


1726
01:12:18.348 --> 01:12:20.016
Her Santa Claus fell through.

1727
01:12:20.058 --> 01:12:21.184
Her Santa backed out?

1728
01:12:21.225 --> 01:12:22.143
No, he literally fell through.

1729
01:12:22.185 --> 01:12:23.603
He fell through a roof.

1730
01:12:23.645 --> 01:12:25.563
I think he was trying
to stay in character.


1731
01:12:25.605 --> 01:12:28.274
Anyway, I have to help her
hand out toys to the kids.


1732
01:12:28.316 --> 01:12:29.275
Are you okay?

1733
01:12:29.317 --> 01:12:30.526
I'm not sure.

1734
01:12:30.568 --> 01:12:31.653
Not sure about what?

1735
01:12:31.694 --> 01:12:33.071
The whole resolution list

1736
01:12:33.112 --> 01:12:34.214
and the submitting to designers.

1737
01:12:34.238 --> 01:12:35.448
What are you talking about?

1738
01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:36.741
My dress had a little run-in

1739
01:12:36.783 --> 01:12:38.451
with a candle and
the candle won.


1740
01:12:38.493 --> 01:12:40.578
Carley, I'm really sorry.

1741
01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:42.306
To think that I dreamed
about this dress for so long,


1742
01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:43.349
you know, and then
I thought that


1743
01:12:43.373 --> 01:12:44.832
if I brought it to life,

1744
01:12:44.874 --> 01:12:46.310
that it would change
something in me.


1745
01:12:46.334 --> 01:12:48.711
And I don't think it did.

1746
01:12:49.337 --> 01:12:50.797
I think I'm the same.

1747
01:12:50.838 --> 01:12:52.191
Well, you could
always start over.


1748
01:12:52.215 --> 01:12:53.508
Go back to the drawing board.

1749
01:12:53.549 --> 01:12:54.944
Right now, I actually
think I'd prefer


1750
01:12:54.968 --> 01:12:57.136
to just take things
back to where they were.


1751
01:12:58.721 --> 01:13:00.321
I mean, I know I had
a really boring job,


1752
01:13:00.348 --> 01:13:03.393
but I had a job and
I was good at it.


1753
01:13:03.434 --> 01:13:04.644
And now...

1754
01:13:07.355 --> 01:13:08.898
I'm just gonna go.

1755
01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:11.317
Have such a nice
time at your thing.


1756
01:13:11.359 --> 01:13:12.318
Merry Christmas.

1757
01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.987
Yeah. Merry Christmas.

1758
01:13:27.625 --> 01:13:29.210
There you are.

1759
01:13:30.086 --> 01:13:31.504
Just on my way to a thing.

1760
01:13:31.546 --> 01:13:32.731
Gertie said you
wanted to see me?


1761
01:13:32.755 --> 01:13:34.340
Yes. This won't take long.

1762
01:13:34.382 --> 01:13:35.675
Have a seat.

1763
01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:45.226
I've been thinking, and,
well, I've made up my mind.


1764
01:13:47.395 --> 01:13:50.356
The tap is back on, so to speak.

1765
01:13:50.398 --> 01:13:51.774
What?

1766
01:13:51.816 --> 01:13:53.085
I've informed the
staff, the banks


1767
01:13:53.109 --> 01:13:54.902
and everyone else.

1768
01:13:54.944 --> 01:13:56.422
But I thought you were giving
me 'til the end of the year.


1769
01:13:56.446 --> 01:13:58.239
I was.

1770
01:13:58.281 --> 01:14:02.035
But you've made it clear you
can take your job seriously.


1771
01:14:02.076 --> 01:14:05.204
I want you to work
beside me, Wyatt.


1772
01:14:05.246 --> 01:14:06.432
Show you how the
business is run.


1773
01:14:06.456 --> 01:14:08.291
And then maybe one day,

1774
01:14:08.333 --> 01:14:10.918
you could even be where I am.

1775
01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:15.381
Dad, I'm not really
sure what to say.


1776
01:14:15.423 --> 01:14:17.925
Yes would be a good start.

1777
01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:20.762
I think I have to quit.

1778
01:14:20.803 --> 01:14:21.804
What?

1779
01:14:23.014 --> 01:14:24.614
I think I need to
quit working for you.


1780
01:14:24.641 --> 01:14:27.268
And I'm not saying that
outta spite, I promise.


1781
01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:31.731
But we haven't been close
for a long time, Dad.


1782
01:14:33.107 --> 01:14:35.318
I spent my whole childhood
trying to make you proud,


1783
01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:36.694
put all my energy into trying

1784
01:14:36.736 --> 01:14:38.196
to be the son I
thought you wanted.


1785
01:14:38.237 --> 01:14:42.116
And after mom died, I
did the exact opposite.


1786
01:14:43.242 --> 01:14:44.661
And it wasn't until recently

1787
01:14:44.702 --> 01:14:47.705
that I realized I don't
wanna be either one


1788
01:14:47.747 --> 01:14:50.249
of those versions
of myself anymore.


1789
01:14:50.291 --> 01:14:51.960
I just wanna be me.

1790
01:14:52.001 --> 01:14:54.837
And I can't figure
out who that person is


1791
01:14:54.879 --> 01:14:57.298
if I don't do it on my own.

1792
01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:59.759
So thank you for the offer,

1793
01:15:01.135 --> 01:15:02.887
but my answer's no.

1794
01:15:05.348 --> 01:15:06.474
I hope you understand.

1795
01:15:06.516 --> 01:15:07.976
Wyatt, wait.

1796
01:15:13.856 --> 01:15:18.152
Dad, you can't bribe me
into staying this time.


1797
01:15:18.194 --> 01:15:19.445
What are these?

1798
01:15:19.487 --> 01:15:20.905
Stocks? Bonds?

1799
01:15:27.370 --> 01:15:31.624
That is the first
Christmas card you ever made


1800
01:15:31.666 --> 01:15:33.918
after learning to write.

1801
01:15:34.919 --> 01:15:37.714
Did all your Rs
and Ys backwards.


1802
01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:43.404
That's from when you
broke the school record


1803
01:15:43.428 --> 01:15:45.346
for the 4,000 meters.

1804
01:15:47.849 --> 01:15:51.352
This is your Harvard
acceptance letter.


1805
01:15:55.773 --> 01:15:56.774
I can keep going.

1806
01:15:56.816 --> 01:15:58.693
There's a lot more.

1807
01:15:59.736 --> 01:16:01.988
You saved all these.

1808
01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:06.159
I know I haven't been the
best father in the world.


1809
01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:09.746
I've never been good
at sharing my feelings.


1810
01:16:10.955 --> 01:16:13.333
Drove your mother nuts.

1811
01:16:13.374 --> 01:16:15.084
But I need to make

1812
01:16:18.546 --> 01:16:20.506
one thing abundantly clear.

1813
01:16:22.383 --> 01:16:24.218
Having you as my son

1814
01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:29.390
has been the single greatest
achievement of my life.


1815
01:16:31.142 --> 01:16:35.229
And I'm sorry if I ever
made you question that.


1816
01:16:46.074 --> 01:16:47.700
Thanks, Dad.

1817
01:16:50.912 --> 01:16:53.289
Well, since you're
leaving the company,


1818
01:16:53.331 --> 01:16:55.875
Ms. Kincaid's timing
couldn't be better.


1819
01:16:55.917 --> 01:16:57.543
You mean Carley?

1820
01:16:57.585 --> 01:16:58.646
She called me about
an hour ago asking


1821
01:16:58.670 --> 01:17:00.338
for her job back.

1822
01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:05.009
Looks like she'll be getting
that promotion after all.


1823
01:17:05.885 --> 01:17:07.804
I can't let her do that.

1824
01:17:07.845 --> 01:17:08.845
Where are you going?

1825
01:17:09.639 --> 01:17:11.766
I gotta catch the bus.

1826
01:17:22.485 --> 01:17:24.529
Merry Christmas, Sarah.

1827
01:17:24.570 --> 01:17:26.698
Really isn't the same
without the big guy, huh?


1828
01:17:26.739 --> 01:17:28.408
Merry Christmas.

1829
01:17:28.449 --> 01:17:29.635
Guess we could all use
a little Christmas cheer.


1830
01:17:29.659 --> 01:17:31.160
There you go sweetie.

1831
01:17:31.202 --> 01:17:32.638
Honey, don't give up
on your dreams just yet.


1832
01:17:32.662 --> 01:17:33.973
There's always next year, right?

1833
01:17:33.997 --> 01:17:35.164
- Sure.
- Merry Christmas.


1834
01:17:35.206 --> 01:17:36.833
Hey, Devin. Merry Christmas.

1835
01:17:36.874 --> 01:17:38.710
Thank you.

1836
01:17:38.751 --> 01:17:40.712
Do you know when Santa's coming?

1837
01:17:40.753 --> 01:17:42.463
I'm sorry, kiddo.

1838
01:17:42.505 --> 01:17:45.008
I don't think he's gonna be
able to make it this year.


1839
01:17:45.049 --> 01:17:46.551
Santa!

1840
01:17:55.643 --> 01:17:58.062
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas!

1841
01:17:58.104 --> 01:17:58.938
Thought Walter broke his leg.

1842
01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:00.148
He did.

1843
01:18:01.816 --> 01:18:03.234
Wyatt?

1844
01:18:03.276 --> 01:18:06.654
No, little one, it
is I, Santa Claus.


1845
01:18:06.696 --> 01:18:08.448
What are you doing?

1846
01:18:08.489 --> 01:18:11.409
Well, I've come to bring
comfort and joy to the children.


1847
01:18:11.451 --> 01:18:14.370
You took two buses and
a train for the children?


1848
01:18:14.412 --> 01:18:16.914
I thought they could
use some cheering up.


1849
01:18:16.956 --> 01:18:18.333
Merry Christmas.

1850
01:18:18.374 --> 01:18:20.251
Let's go open with
some gifts, huh?


1851
01:18:20.293 --> 01:18:21.294
Yeah!

1852
01:18:23.046 --> 01:18:24.714
Merry Christmas.

1853
01:18:24.756 --> 01:18:25.548
Who wants a present?

1854
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:26.758
Come here.

1855
01:18:30.136 --> 01:18:32.096
Credit to the real Santa.

1856
01:18:32.138 --> 01:18:34.974
This job really
takes it outta you.


1857
01:18:35.016 --> 01:18:36.768
Are you in a tux?

1858
01:18:36.809 --> 01:18:41.022
Is this not the dress code
for a children's toy drive?


1859
01:18:41.064 --> 01:18:42.231
Okay, lemme guess.

1860
01:18:42.273 --> 01:18:44.692
Illegal sleigh racing in Soho?

1861
01:18:45.777 --> 01:18:47.445
Not quite.

1862
01:18:47.487 --> 01:18:49.530
It's actually the Snow
and Ice Gala in Greenwich.


1863
01:18:49.572 --> 01:18:51.074
You'd actually,
you'd really like it.


1864
01:18:51.115 --> 01:18:52.492
It's champagne, red carpet,

1865
01:18:52.533 --> 01:18:55.954
everyone wearing
the latest fashions.


1866
01:18:55.995 --> 01:18:59.999
But I realized I needed
to be here with you.


1867
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:02.627
Don't go back to Comfort Mills.

1868
01:19:02.669 --> 01:19:04.462
Why not?

1869
01:19:04.504 --> 01:19:05.648
Because your dreams are
too big for that place.


1870
01:19:05.672 --> 01:19:07.674
You're too good for it.

1871
01:19:11.511 --> 01:19:13.513
Look, I just have
two resolutions left.


1872
01:19:13.554 --> 01:19:16.891
Follow your dreams and
say yes to adventure.


1873
01:19:16.933 --> 01:19:20.353
I can just make
another list next year.


1874
01:19:21.062 --> 01:19:23.815
Or give it another shot.

1875
01:19:23.856 --> 01:19:25.316
Why? Why should I do that?

1876
01:19:25.358 --> 01:19:27.277
Look, I'm here in
a half Santa suit


1877
01:19:27.318 --> 01:19:29.153
at a toy drive on Christmas Eve

1878
01:19:29.195 --> 01:19:32.115
and there is nowhere,
literally nowhere else,


1879
01:19:32.156 --> 01:19:34.951
I would rather be other
than here with you.


1880
01:19:34.993 --> 01:19:36.828
I believe in you.

1881
01:19:36.869 --> 01:19:37.954
We all do.

1882
01:19:45.586 --> 01:19:46.838
I needed that.

1883
01:19:50.675 --> 01:19:53.761
You know these Santa pants
are weirdly working for you.


1884
01:19:53.803 --> 01:19:56.556
- What? This old thing?
- Yeah.


1885
01:19:58.558 --> 01:20:00.476
I owe you an apology.

1886
01:20:00.518 --> 01:20:01.936
For what?

1887
01:20:01.978 --> 01:20:03.163
I spent this whole
year thinking you


1888
01:20:03.187 --> 01:20:05.648
were a spoiled rich man child.

1889
01:20:07.066 --> 01:20:08.401
I am rich.

1890
01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.613
But you're not. You're not.

1891
01:20:11.654 --> 01:20:12.780
You are kind

1892
01:20:14.907 --> 01:20:16.659
and you are generous

1893
01:20:16.701 --> 01:20:18.036
and you are thoughtful.

1894
01:20:19.704 --> 01:20:21.914
I didn't really know you at all.

1895
01:20:21.956 --> 01:20:23.207
Wow.

1896
01:20:25.877 --> 01:20:27.587
Well, it's not your fault.

1897
01:20:29.255 --> 01:20:32.467
I mean, I'm not even
really sure I knew myself,


1898
01:20:32.508 --> 01:20:36.346
but thanks to you, I
think I'm starting to.


1899
01:20:53.112 --> 01:20:54.489
Looking good, Gertie.

1900
01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:57.367
Carley's grandmother
really knows her stuff.


1901
01:21:01.621 --> 01:21:03.331
Pop?

1902
01:21:03.373 --> 01:21:05.309
The countdown's about to
start. They got enough bubbly?


1903
01:21:05.333 --> 01:21:06.376
On it.

1904
01:21:09.963 --> 01:21:12.382
First time for everything.

1905
01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.426
Where's the little rascal?

1906
01:21:15.468 --> 01:21:17.053
I think she said something

1907
01:21:17.095 --> 01:21:18.513
about claiming your old bedroom.

1908
01:21:18.554 --> 01:21:19.806
It's all hers.

1909
01:21:19.847 --> 01:21:21.349
See you guys in a bit.

1910
01:21:22.934 --> 01:21:24.286
Millie, Millie,
Millie, you made it.


1911
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:25.478
Of course, dear.

1912
01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:27.981
Now the party can get started.

1913
01:21:28.022 --> 01:21:29.691
You remember.

1914
01:21:29.732 --> 01:21:31.526
Randall, what a surprise!

1915
01:21:31.567 --> 01:21:32.944
For you, maybe.

1916
01:21:32.986 --> 01:21:34.612
He's been asking
me out for years.


1917
01:21:34.654 --> 01:21:37.490
Don't ever give up
on romance, my boy.


1918
01:21:37.532 --> 01:21:38.449
I won't.

1919
01:21:38.491 --> 01:21:39.742
Oh, Millie.

1920
01:21:41.411 --> 01:21:43.746
Ladies, looking great as usual.

1921
01:21:43.788 --> 01:21:46.165
Nice job on the party, Wyatt.

1922
01:21:46.207 --> 01:21:48.251
Top notch,
vintage, Mr. Grinch.


1923
01:21:48.293 --> 01:21:50.962
High praise coming
from the sommelier.


1924
01:21:51.004 --> 01:21:52.380
Is Carley here?

1925
01:21:52.422 --> 01:21:53.756
She told us to come ahead.

1926
01:21:53.798 --> 01:21:55.341
Wanted to do some final touches.

1927
01:21:55.383 --> 01:21:57.010
Cutting it kinda close.

1928
01:21:57.051 --> 01:21:59.762
Or she's just fashionably late.

1929
01:22:04.684 --> 01:22:05.810
Excuse me.

1930
01:22:19.032 --> 01:22:20.241
Kincaid.

1931
01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:21.784
Redmond.

1932
01:22:22.577 --> 01:22:23.703
You look...

1933
01:22:24.495 --> 01:22:25.663
The dress...

1934
01:22:28.166 --> 01:22:29.709
You look incredible.

1935
01:22:29.751 --> 01:22:30.918
Thank you.

1936
01:22:32.670 --> 01:22:36.466
Yeah, I thought I would
try something new.


1937
01:22:37.675 --> 01:22:38.944
You know the countdown's
about to start.


1938
01:22:38.968 --> 01:22:40.345
- Inside?
- Yeah.


1939
01:22:43.306 --> 01:22:46.935
I don't know if I
want this year to end.


1940
01:22:48.686 --> 01:22:51.731
I sent my portfolio to
every designer in town.


1941
01:22:55.234 --> 01:22:57.320
Kind of nervous
about it, actually.


1942
01:22:57.362 --> 01:22:58.905
It'll be fine.

1943
01:23:00.406 --> 01:23:02.992
I still have this one
that I haven't crossed off.


1944
01:23:03.034 --> 01:23:05.411
- Say yes to adventure.
- Mm-hm.


1945

How many more adventures could
you possibly need, Kincaid?


1946
01:23:09.248 --> 01:23:12.126
I actually do have one in mind.

1947
01:23:12.168 --> 01:23:13.836
Can you hold this
for me for a minute?


1948
01:23:13.878 --> 01:23:15.505
- Yeah.
- Thanks.


1949
01:23:23.554 --> 01:23:26.557
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.
