00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:40.599
* Long ago

2
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:44.336
* We were young

3
00:00:44.403 --> 00:00:48.173
* We played games

4
00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.545
* It was fun

5
00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:04.956
* Wise men say
all things go too fast *


6
00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:09.160
* And babies don't last

7
00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:12.330
* They grow up as soon
as they get the chance *


8
00:01:12.398 --> 00:01:16.502
* Let's face it

9
00:01:16.568 --> 00:01:20.171
* A whole new way
of behavin' *


10
00:01:20.238 --> 00:01:22.874
* With brand-new rules
to break *


11
00:01:22.941 --> 00:01:24.009
* Wah-hoo!

12
00:01:24.075 --> 00:01:26.111
* How time flies

13
00:01:26.177 --> 00:01:33.051
* We were once
ahead of the game *


14
00:01:33.118 --> 00:01:39.858
* Can you remember
when gettin' up was easy? *


15
00:01:39.925 --> 00:01:41.427
* No sweat

16
00:01:41.493 --> 00:01:48.767
* And we could exist
on wax and gum completely *


17
00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:52.538
* The things we used to think
were crazy *


18
00:01:52.604 --> 00:01:54.806
* Now they seem
so very sane *


19
00:01:54.873 --> 00:01:55.874
* Wah-hoo!

20
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:58.243
* How time flies

21
00:01:58.309 --> 00:02:02.614
* We were once
ahead of the game *


22
00:02:02.681 --> 00:02:03.715
* Wah-hoo!

23
00:02:03.782 --> 00:02:05.817
* How time flies

24
00:02:05.884 --> 00:02:10.388
* We were once
ahead of the game *


25
00:02:10.456 --> 00:02:14.092
* Love hit us
right between the eyes *


26
00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.494
* It wasn't fair

27
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:17.896
* We never had a chance

28
00:02:17.963 --> 00:02:21.600
* Sometimes
you have to sit right back *


29
00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:23.068
* And laugh

30
00:02:23.134 --> 00:02:29.508
* It goes so fast

31
00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:48.927
* As sure as there's
a Sunday morning, baby *


32
00:02:48.994 --> 00:02:51.897
* We're going to get
our piece of the cake *


33
00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:52.964
* Wah-hoo!

34
00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:55.233
* How time flies

35
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.605
* We were once
ahead of the game *


36
00:02:59.671 --> 00:03:00.739
* Wah-hoo!

37
00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:03.374
* How time flies

38
00:03:03.441 --> 00:03:07.245
* We were once
ahead of the game *


39
00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:08.313
* Wah-hoo!

40
00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.315
* How time flies

41
00:03:10.381 --> 00:03:14.853
* We were once
ahead of the game *


42
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:31.537
Morning, Mr. Harper.

43
00:03:31.603 --> 00:03:32.671
Morning, Jeff.

44
00:03:32.738 --> 00:03:34.172
Hi, Ralph.
Morning, sir.


45
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.546
Hello?

46
00:03:40.612 --> 00:03:42.380
Security.

47
00:03:42.447 --> 00:03:43.481
Dick...

48
00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.183
Charlie.

49
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.752
I've been waiting
for you.


50
00:03:47.385 --> 00:03:48.587
How have you been?

51
00:03:48.654 --> 00:03:50.656
Sit down.
Pour yourself a drink.


52
00:03:50.722 --> 00:03:52.257
Thanks, Charlie.

53
00:03:56.394 --> 00:03:58.797
This business stinks,
you know that?


54
00:03:58.864 --> 00:03:59.865
Well...

55
00:03:59.931 --> 00:04:00.966
It stinks.

56
00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.233
It used to be

57
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.603
the most exciting business
in the world,


58
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.606
and now it stinks
on ice.


59
00:04:07.673 --> 00:04:08.707
It's been
a rough year.


60
00:04:08.774 --> 00:04:11.009
It stinks.

61
00:04:11.076 --> 00:04:12.510
I guess it does stink.

62
00:04:12.578 --> 00:04:15.814
It stinks on ice.

63
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:17.649
All right, on ice.

64
00:04:20.018 --> 00:04:21.419
You know,

65
00:04:21.486 --> 00:04:23.622
it was a great feeling
to be part of the team


66
00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:25.523
that tied the lace on the shoe

67
00:04:25.591 --> 00:04:28.860
that took that giant step
for mankind.


68
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:34.766
You don't get that feeling from
building a goddamn missile.


69
00:04:36.935 --> 00:04:38.737
Now, what's
all this crap?


70
00:04:38.804 --> 00:04:40.572
It's my plan
to re-organize my department.


71
00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.374
One small step...

72
00:04:43.441 --> 00:04:45.877
one giant step
for mankind.


73
00:04:45.944 --> 00:04:48.446
I wouldn't say that,
but it's not a bad plan.


74
00:04:48.513 --> 00:04:50.281
You know who made
that step possible?


75
00:04:50.348 --> 00:04:53.318
We did, you and me...

76
00:04:53.384 --> 00:04:57.522
and Bob Kane, Frank Chapman.

77
00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:04.295
We put Neil and what's-his-name
on the bloody moon,


78
00:05:04.362 --> 00:05:06.632
and then they gave
us the shaft.


79
00:05:06.698 --> 00:05:08.099
It stinks...

80
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.803
on ice.

81
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.373
What do you say
we talk turkey?


82
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.008
Right, Charlie.

83
00:05:17.075 --> 00:05:18.409
I was thinking
more in terms


84
00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:20.178
of cutting costs
than personnel.


85
00:05:20.245 --> 00:05:22.914
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

86
00:05:24.382 --> 00:05:25.951
I was just talking turkey.

87
00:05:32.157 --> 00:05:33.191
Dick...

88
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.062
I always thought

89
00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.130
you were the kind of guy
I didn't have to bullshit.


90
00:05:39.197 --> 00:05:40.298
I'm glad to hear that.

91
00:05:40.365 --> 00:05:42.668
Can I level with you?

92
00:05:42.734 --> 00:05:44.502
Sure.

93
00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:46.838
I mean, really level?

94
00:05:46.905 --> 00:05:48.940
Charlie,
you can tell me anything.


95
00:05:49.007 --> 00:05:50.676
You're fired.

96
00:05:58.583 --> 00:06:00.919
I must have fired

97
00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:02.754
but that's the first time
I did it like that.


98
00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:04.155
The first time
I ever said,


99
00:06:04.222 --> 00:06:06.792
just, like,
"You're fired".


100
00:06:06.858 --> 00:06:09.327
Practice
makes perfect.


101
00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:16.167
No, I shouldn't
have done that.


102
00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:19.805
It's just that I'm sick
of all the bullshit.


103
00:06:19.871 --> 00:06:21.406
Wait a minute.

104
00:06:22.373 --> 00:06:23.742
You're serious?

105
00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:25.543
Would I kid a pal?

106
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.747
No jokes, Charlie.
You're really firing me?


107
00:06:31.116 --> 00:06:33.518
I don't have to tell you
what a lousy year we've had.


108
00:06:33.584 --> 00:06:35.586
I haven't done a bad job.

109
00:06:35.653 --> 00:06:37.155
Oh, you've done
a hell of a job,


110
00:06:37.222 --> 00:06:39.224
and don't you let anybody
tell you different.


111
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.993
Then why me?

112
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.429
My divisions
out-performed everybody's.


113
00:06:44.495 --> 00:06:49.868
Seniority.
I think that's what it was.


114
00:06:49.935 --> 00:06:52.270
I'm sure that's what it was.

115
00:06:52.337 --> 00:06:54.105
Seniority. Yeah.

116
00:06:54.172 --> 00:06:55.473
Do you mean

117
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.875
that when you compare
the productivity


118
00:06:56.942 --> 00:06:57.843
in my division...

119
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:59.310
Dick...

120
00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:03.014
Do you mind if we don't go
into all that crap right now?


121
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:06.451
Frankly, I'm...
I'm a little bit looped,


122
00:07:06.517 --> 00:07:10.555
and I've got blood
on my hands...


123
00:07:10.621 --> 00:07:12.791
a lot of blood.

124
00:07:37.048 --> 00:07:38.449
Oh, Mr. Harper.

125
00:07:38.516 --> 00:07:40.919
I'll have
to get back to you.


126
00:07:41.787 --> 00:07:43.789
I just want to say

127
00:07:43.855 --> 00:07:45.924
I'm very sorry
you're leaving us.


128
00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:48.593
Well, thank you.

129
00:07:48.659 --> 00:07:51.930
Did Mr. Blanchard
tell you about the car?


130
00:07:51.997 --> 00:07:53.231
What car?

131
00:07:53.298 --> 00:07:55.166
The company car
you've been using.


132
00:07:55.233 --> 00:07:57.235
You may retain the use of it
for two weeks.


133
00:07:57.302 --> 00:07:59.137
Isn't that thoughtful?

134
00:07:59.204 --> 00:08:02.473
But we must have
your company credit cards now,


135
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.109
please.

136
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.982
Goodbye, Mr. Harper.

137
00:08:29.434 --> 00:08:31.169
Jane?

138
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:37.575
Hey, what is this?

139
00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:40.178
This is distressing.

140
00:08:49.787 --> 00:08:51.456
Jane.

141
00:08:51.522 --> 00:08:53.691
Jane...

142
00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:57.863
Hey, sweetie.
you're home early.


143
00:08:57.929 --> 00:08:59.197
I've got to
talk to you.


144
00:08:59.264 --> 00:09:01.066
I've got to talk to you,
Mr. Harper.


145
00:09:01.132 --> 00:09:02.400
Listen,

146
00:09:02.467 --> 00:09:03.734
the second payment's due
on the pool.


147
00:09:05.203 --> 00:09:06.804
I've been fired.

148
00:09:08.706 --> 00:09:10.041
Billy, will you
get your friend


149
00:09:10.108 --> 00:09:11.242
out of the cement?

150
00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:14.946
I've been fired.

151
00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:15.947
Huh?

152
00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:18.316
I've been fired!

153
00:09:34.132 --> 00:09:35.600
Oh, baby.

154
00:09:35.666 --> 00:09:38.436
What did you say?

155
00:09:38.503 --> 00:09:41.106
He said he's tired.

156
00:09:42.273 --> 00:09:45.343
Hey, Mr. Harper,
you were canned today.


157
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.678
Yeah.

158
00:09:47.745 --> 00:09:50.148
What sign are you? Huh?

159
00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:51.482
Uh...

160
00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:53.418
He's an Aquarius.

161
00:09:53.484 --> 00:09:54.819
Oh, you poor bastard.

162
00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:56.021
I knew it.

163
00:09:56.087 --> 00:09:57.722
What a bummer.

164
00:09:57.788 --> 00:10:01.792
Mars is in
direct conjunction


165
00:10:01.859 --> 00:10:03.294
with Saturn.

166
00:10:03.361 --> 00:10:07.698
Ah, it's a tough time
for us Aquarians.


167
00:10:07.765 --> 00:10:10.101
You know that bill
I gave you, for the pool,


168
00:10:10.168 --> 00:10:12.037
the second payment?

169
00:10:12.103 --> 00:10:14.539
I'll give you
till next Wednesday.


170
00:10:14.605 --> 00:10:16.141
Hmm.

171
00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:34.259
Ah, Esperanza.

172
00:10:34.325 --> 00:10:35.493
La cena is ready.

173
00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.494
Thank you.

174
00:10:36.561 --> 00:10:38.263
Gracias.

175
00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:39.864
Mm.

176
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.933
I can't believe
that Charlie fired you.


177
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.935
Charlie fired me.

178
00:10:44.002 --> 00:10:45.336
Dirty rat.

179
00:10:45.403 --> 00:10:47.205
After all the years
of bottom-pinching


180
00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:48.839
I took from him?

181
00:10:48.906 --> 00:10:50.275
Does that mean
we're going to be poor


182
00:10:50.341 --> 00:10:51.876
like the Waltons?

183
00:10:53.344 --> 00:10:55.846
No, Billy, it doesn't.

184
00:10:55.913 --> 00:10:58.849
What are we going to do
about the pool?


185
00:11:00.685 --> 00:11:03.121
We'll get it finished first.

186
00:11:04.422 --> 00:11:05.556
We won't heat it...

187
00:11:06.857 --> 00:11:08.759
not until you get
another job.


188
00:11:08.826 --> 00:11:10.828
How are we going to swim
if it's cold?


189
00:11:10.895 --> 00:11:12.663
Billy is absolutely right.

190
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:13.931
What will the neighbors say

191
00:11:13.999 --> 00:11:15.866
if they don't see any steam
coming off our pool


192
00:11:15.933 --> 00:11:17.202
on a chilly night?

193
00:11:17.268 --> 00:11:18.936
I'm going to make some
economies around here.


194
00:11:19.004 --> 00:11:20.972
Billy, we're going to give up
our ski lessons.


195
00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:22.140
God!

196
00:11:22.207 --> 00:11:23.574
No more French wines at home,
sir.


197
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:26.477
Oh, God!

198
00:11:26.544 --> 00:11:28.646
And I will drop
the Book of the Month Club.


199
00:11:28.713 --> 00:11:30.948
But what about my drum set?

200
00:11:31.016 --> 00:11:32.250
Family,

201
00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:33.618
everything's going to be
all right.


202
00:11:33.684 --> 00:11:36.821
There's absolutely nothing
to worry about.


203
00:11:39.724 --> 00:11:41.892
Take that stuff up there.

204
00:11:41.959 --> 00:11:43.995
Hey you, in the truck.
Watch those plants.


205
00:11:44.062 --> 00:11:45.396
Watch those...

206
00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:54.405
Stop it.

207
00:11:54.472 --> 00:11:56.341
Hello, Mrs. Harper.

208
00:11:56.407 --> 00:11:57.342
That goes next.

209
00:11:57.408 --> 00:11:58.376
What in God's name

210
00:11:58.443 --> 00:12:00.078
do you think
you're doing?


211
00:12:00.145 --> 00:12:01.979
You got our notice,
Mrs. Harper?


212
00:12:02.047 --> 00:12:03.814
Yes. I sent you a check.

213
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:05.016
Bouncy, bouncy.

214
00:12:05.083 --> 00:12:07.318
That's naughty,
Mrs. Harper.


215
00:12:07.385 --> 00:12:08.253
Hey, hey,
watch those plants.


216
00:12:08.319 --> 00:12:09.320
Watch that stuff.

217
00:12:09.387 --> 00:12:10.621
Get it up
over there.


218
00:12:10.688 --> 00:12:11.956
Look,
I'll give you another check.


219
00:12:12.023 --> 00:12:14.792
Two checks bounced
already, Mrs. Harper.


220
00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:16.327
Your mother
may have carried you


221
00:12:16.394 --> 00:12:17.595
for nine months,

222
00:12:17.662 --> 00:12:18.896
but we'll only carry you
for two.


223
00:12:18.963 --> 00:12:20.465
Clear that bank off.

224
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:22.300
Look, just because the bank
made a mistake,


225
00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:24.001
there's no reason
to come and dig up...


226
00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:25.503
My tree!

227
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:26.837
Not yours. Ours.

228
00:12:26.904 --> 00:12:27.972
We put this stuff in,

229
00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.474
and now we're going
to tear it out.


230
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.475
Watch it.

231
00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:32.143
If you don't want
to lose your shirt,


232
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.744
don't put it
on the cuff.


233
00:12:33.811 --> 00:12:35.480
You're using
Gestapo tactics.


234
00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:38.549
That's impossible.
I'm Jewish.


235
00:12:38.616 --> 00:12:41.086
Hey, hey, watch those
plants over there.


236
00:12:41.152 --> 00:12:42.053
Ah...

237
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.221
Now watch them roots.

238
00:12:43.288 --> 00:12:44.689
That's right,

239
00:12:44.755 --> 00:12:46.324
I'd like you to take
all of these bushes out,


240
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:48.326
all of these trees,
everything up there,


241
00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:49.860
every rotten weed
in this whole garden,


242
00:12:49.927 --> 00:12:51.696
and this...
come here for a second.


243
00:12:51.762 --> 00:12:53.998
Would you please remove
this tracheotomy


244
00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:55.400
or whatever it's called?

245
00:12:55.466 --> 00:12:56.634
This is not
what we ordered,


246
00:12:56.701 --> 00:12:58.369
and I told you so
a month ago.


247
00:12:58.436 --> 00:12:59.670
Oh. Can you
believe this?


248
00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:01.272
I told them,
you plant what we want


249
00:13:01.339 --> 00:13:03.274
or I'm going to make
you take it all back.


250
00:13:03.341 --> 00:13:04.775
What a ripoff.

251
00:13:04.842 --> 00:13:06.111
That's right,
roll up the lawn.


252
00:13:06.177 --> 00:13:08.012
I don't like the lawn
either.


253
00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:10.248
Astroturf has more life
than this stuff.


254
00:13:10.315 --> 00:13:12.783
You will never work
in this neighborhood again.


255
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.185
I'll tell you that.

256
00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:16.854
Yeah.

257
00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:22.393
Hey, Mom,
you were terrific.


258
00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.661
You think so, kid?

259
00:13:23.728 --> 00:13:24.562
Mm-hm.

260
00:13:25.863 --> 00:13:27.432
What do you want?

261
00:13:27.498 --> 00:13:28.899
I want the plants inside.

262
00:13:28.966 --> 00:13:30.535
Listen, you step one foot
in this house,


263
00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:32.237
I'm going to call
the police.


264
00:13:32.303 --> 00:13:33.504
I still want the plants.

265
00:13:38.809 --> 00:13:40.311
Pretty grim, huh?

266
00:13:40.378 --> 00:13:43.648
What are we going to tell Dad
when he comes home?


267
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.206
Oh.

268
00:14:08.273 --> 00:14:10.341
Are you going to tell me
how bad things are,


269
00:14:10.408 --> 00:14:11.476
or are you just
going to wait


270
00:14:11.542 --> 00:14:13.043
for the roof
to fall in on my head?


271
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.446
Well, it really isn't
as bad as it looks.


272
00:14:15.513 --> 00:14:18.149
Nothing is as bad
as this looks.


273
00:14:18.216 --> 00:14:20.618
Dick, we don't have any income
and we don't have any assets.


274
00:14:20.685 --> 00:14:21.652
What do you mean

275
00:14:21.719 --> 00:14:23.087
we don't have
any assets?


276
00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:24.021
Well, other than
the sun in the morning


277
00:14:24.088 --> 00:14:25.223
and the moon at night.

278
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:26.957
We've got this house.

279
00:14:27.024 --> 00:14:29.227
We owe $77,000
on this house,


280
00:14:29.294 --> 00:14:30.628
and if you were
to die right now,


281
00:14:30.695 --> 00:14:31.996
how would I
pay it off?


282
00:14:32.062 --> 00:14:32.963
It'd come out
of the insurance.


283
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.432
We don't have
any insurance.


284
00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:35.633
You borrowed against it.

285
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.268
Oh, right, right.
I forgot.


286
00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:39.537
Look, this is ridiculous.
I won't die tonight.


287
00:14:39.604 --> 00:14:41.306
I don't know.
The night is young.


288
00:14:41.372 --> 00:14:42.607
It's comforting to know

289
00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:44.442
that when things
really get tough,


290
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:45.776
I'll have you
standing behind me


291
00:14:45.843 --> 00:14:47.178
with an ice pick
in your hand.


292
00:14:47.245 --> 00:14:48.413
You've been leading
a secret life


293
00:14:48.479 --> 00:14:49.614
for these last years.

294
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.948
I mean, what, for example,

295
00:14:51.015 --> 00:14:54.385
what are Unsecured
Municipal Debentures?


296
00:14:54.452 --> 00:14:55.786
I don't know, I...

297
00:14:55.853 --> 00:14:57.688
Look, I gambled
a few things and lost.


298
00:14:57.755 --> 00:14:59.156
You gambled. You lost.

299
00:14:59.224 --> 00:15:00.358
What about me?

300
00:15:00.425 --> 00:15:01.626
I gambled and lost,

301
00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:03.328
and I didn't even get
a chance to play.


302
00:15:03.394 --> 00:15:04.495
I didn't even watch.

303
00:15:04.562 --> 00:15:05.730
Excuse me,
but I thought


304
00:15:05.796 --> 00:15:07.097
that your interest
in economics


305
00:15:07.164 --> 00:15:08.299
was limited
to the spending part.


306
00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:09.800
I always thought of you

307
00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:11.502
as a responsible
aerospace executive.


308
00:15:11.569 --> 00:15:12.803
Who would have known

309
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.472
you were the Typhoid Mary
of High Finance?


310
00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:15.806
If I'd consulted you,

311
00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:16.841
there wouldn't have been
a recession,


312
00:15:16.907 --> 00:15:18.209
I wouldn't have lost my job.

313
00:15:18.276 --> 00:15:20.245
If you think you can
do better, take over.


314
00:15:20.311 --> 00:15:21.812
It would be hard
to do it any worse.


315
00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:24.148
Go ahead, be my guest.
It's all yours.


316
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:26.717
My very thought,

317
00:15:26.784 --> 00:15:30.187
and my first act as Director
of Family Economics


318
00:15:30.255 --> 00:15:32.056
is to put you on an allowance.

319
00:15:32.122 --> 00:15:33.224
On a what?

320
00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:35.293
What kind of lunatic
spends $1,000 on lunch


321
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.194
when he's out of a job
and deeply in debt?


322
00:15:37.262 --> 00:15:38.963
The kind that knows
that you can't get a job


323
00:15:39.029 --> 00:15:40.365
if you look
like a loser.


324
00:15:40.431 --> 00:15:41.932
If I was Diners Club,

325
00:15:41.999 --> 00:15:45.169
I'd have your stomach bronzed
and put in the Hall of Fame.


326
00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:46.637
Your job for the moment...

327
00:15:46.704 --> 00:15:49.006
get on the food stamp program,
look for work in your field.


328
00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:50.608
Excuse me.

329
00:15:50.675 --> 00:15:53.944
Why don't I get a job-job,
like a busboy or a waiter?


330
00:15:54.011 --> 00:15:56.180
I mean, if we're not too proud
to go on welfare...


331
00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:57.181
We can't afford it.

332
00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:58.649
Can't afford it?

333
00:15:58.716 --> 00:16:00.685
You can earn more money
on unemployment


334
00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:02.587
than you could
on any of those jobs.


335
00:16:02.653 --> 00:16:04.922
My job is to get a job-job.

336
00:16:04.989 --> 00:16:06.757
You're going to get a job?

337
00:16:06.824 --> 00:16:10.227
Mm-hmm, yes.
Incredible as it may seem.


338
00:16:10.295 --> 00:16:12.597
May I ask...
no offense, mind you...


339
00:16:12.663 --> 00:16:14.399
What do you think
you're qualified to do?


340
00:16:14.465 --> 00:16:16.434
Secretary of the Treasury
seems to be filled


341
00:16:16.501 --> 00:16:17.635
at the moment.

342
00:16:17.702 --> 00:16:18.503
There must be lots
I can do.


343
00:16:18.569 --> 00:16:19.570
Oh, come on, Jane.

344
00:16:19.637 --> 00:16:21.038
You never worked
a day in your life,


345
00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:23.107
and you can't type
and can't take shorthand.


346
00:16:23.173 --> 00:16:25.109
I'm a college graduate,

347
00:16:25.175 --> 00:16:28.078
reasonably intelligent,
not altogether unattractive.


348
00:16:28.145 --> 00:16:31.248
Yes, but will you be happy
being a hooker?


349
00:16:31.316 --> 00:16:33.318
Interesting that
the only two jobs


350
00:16:33.384 --> 00:16:35.019
you consider me qualified for

351
00:16:35.085 --> 00:16:36.521
are secretary and hooker.

352
00:16:36.587 --> 00:16:39.223
You're not qualified
to be a secretary.


353
00:16:45.029 --> 00:16:47.365
What an interview.

354
00:16:47.432 --> 00:16:49.534
Oh, don't take it
too hard, honey.


355
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.868
It's only
the first time.


356
00:16:50.935 --> 00:16:54.472
Take it too hard?
I start on Monday.


357
00:16:54.539 --> 00:16:56.774
Oh, that's wonderful.

358
00:17:29.273 --> 00:17:31.342
The line ends
after me, mister.


359
00:17:31.409 --> 00:17:33.243
Oh, sorry.

360
00:17:37.848 --> 00:17:39.517
That's a pretty nice suit,
mister.


361
00:17:39.584 --> 00:17:40.718
Thank you.

362
00:17:40.785 --> 00:17:41.986
You've got some nerve
coming in here


363
00:17:42.052 --> 00:17:43.053
dressed like that.

364
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.221
People in here
need this money.


365
00:17:44.288 --> 00:17:47.825
This ain't no damn joyride.

366
00:17:48.993 --> 00:17:50.795
Hey, you're Mr. Harper,
aren't you?


367
00:17:50.861 --> 00:17:51.996
Taft Aerospace?

368
00:17:52.062 --> 00:17:52.930
Yeah.

369
00:17:52.997 --> 00:17:54.699
I'm Raoul Esteban. Remember?

370
00:17:54.765 --> 00:17:56.501
I was in the Taft
Maintenance Division.


371
00:17:56.567 --> 00:17:57.735
I used to do your office.

372
00:17:57.802 --> 00:17:59.370
Oh, sure, Raoul.

373
00:17:59.437 --> 00:18:00.471
How are you doing, man?

374
00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:02.973
Hey, they canned you too, huh?

375
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.842
It's a little more
complicated than that.


376
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:06.176
Is this your first
time in here?


377
00:18:06.243 --> 00:18:07.144
Damn right.

378
00:18:07.211 --> 00:18:08.278
Man, are you in luck.

379
00:18:08.345 --> 00:18:10.381
I'm going to take care of you.

380
00:18:10.448 --> 00:18:12.282
Mi casa, su casa,
you know what I mean?


381
00:18:12.349 --> 00:18:13.751
Oh, sure.

382
00:18:13.818 --> 00:18:15.319
First thing though.
Look, you're in the wrong line.


383
00:18:15.386 --> 00:18:17.388
I'm going to lose
my place here, Raoul.


384
00:18:17.455 --> 00:18:18.556
Information...

385
00:18:18.623 --> 00:18:20.190
they make you wait in line
two hours,


386
00:18:20.257 --> 00:18:22.860
and all they do is tell you
to fill out one of these.


387
00:18:22.927 --> 00:18:24.862
I'm going to take care of you.

388
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.236
I'm going to have an operation
in a month.


389
00:18:32.302 --> 00:18:34.472
You know, the operation,

390
00:18:34.539 --> 00:18:35.906
and my analyst said

391
00:18:35.973 --> 00:18:38.208
I should start
making the adjustment,


392
00:18:38.275 --> 00:18:41.111
and, uh, well,
that's why they fired me,


393
00:18:41.178 --> 00:18:43.748
just for wearing
a most demure gray maxi


394
00:18:43.814 --> 00:18:45.716
with a matching cashmere
twin set.


395
00:18:45.783 --> 00:18:47.852
It's all here
in the letter from my analyst.


396
00:18:47.918 --> 00:18:49.153
Let me check this out.

397
00:18:49.219 --> 00:18:50.621
Maybe we should pick
another line.


398
00:18:50.688 --> 00:18:51.889
What do you say?

399
00:18:51.956 --> 00:18:53.424
Listen, man,
it's no sweat.


400
00:18:53.491 --> 00:18:54.625
They ain't going to
hassle you.


401
00:18:54.692 --> 00:18:55.960
Look what
your card says,


402
00:18:56.026 --> 00:18:57.662
"aerospace executive."

403
00:18:57.728 --> 00:18:59.697
Yeah, but I'm not that
anymore.


404
00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:01.866
In here, man,
you are what you were.


405
00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:04.301
You're going to get

406
00:19:04.368 --> 00:19:05.369
All I get is 50.

407
00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:07.638
You're top guy
around here.


408
00:19:07.705 --> 00:19:10.374
They ain't going to mess
with a guy like you.


409
00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:13.143
Well, why do I have to see
the supervisor?


410
00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.679
It's all so simple.

411
00:19:14.745 --> 00:19:16.113
I'm sorry.

412
00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.549
Oh, all right.

413
00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:19.650
Shoot.

414
00:19:24.722 --> 00:19:26.056
I've seen some
fruits in my day,


415
00:19:26.123 --> 00:19:28.659
but he really takes the cake,
huh?


416
00:19:28.726 --> 00:19:29.960
Not really.

417
00:19:30.027 --> 00:19:31.428
Oh, come on.

418
00:19:31.496 --> 00:19:33.163
That's the flamingest faggot
I've ever seen.


419
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:37.401
In the first place,
he's a transsexual,


420
00:19:37.468 --> 00:19:39.770
not a fruit, not a fag,
not even a homosexual.


421
00:19:39.837 --> 00:19:42.339
He has the mind, soul,
and desires


422
00:19:42.406 --> 00:19:44.675
of a woman imprisoned
in a man's body,


423
00:19:44.742 --> 00:19:50.114
and now,
what can I do for you, sir?


424
00:19:51.582 --> 00:19:54.585
Uh...

425
00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:56.887
Oh, God.

426
00:19:58.322 --> 00:20:00.390
Good night.

427
00:20:00.457 --> 00:20:02.392
Dick, do you resent it
that I got a job?


428
00:20:02.459 --> 00:20:04.028
Don't be silly.

429
00:20:06.897 --> 00:20:08.499
Well, you shouldn't
feel threatened, because...


430
00:20:08.566 --> 00:20:09.500
Now look, Jane,

431
00:20:09.567 --> 00:20:11.135
I don't resent
you getting a job.


432
00:20:11.201 --> 00:20:13.170
I'm thrilled
you got a job.


433
00:20:13.237 --> 00:20:14.872
I can tell
by the way you're shouting.


434
00:20:14.939 --> 00:20:16.340
I'm shouting

435
00:20:16.406 --> 00:20:18.442
because I've got an interview
at 9:00 in the morning


436
00:20:18.509 --> 00:20:20.878
about food stamps and I'd like
to get some sleep,


437
00:20:20.945 --> 00:20:22.246
or maybe,

438
00:20:22.312 --> 00:20:24.181
now that you've conquered
the business world,


439
00:20:24.248 --> 00:20:25.516
we don't need them.

440
00:20:25.583 --> 00:20:27.051
Dick, I thought
you were going today


441
00:20:27.117 --> 00:20:28.385
to get food stamps.

442
00:20:28.452 --> 00:20:30.821
Jane, you just don't
get food stamps.


443
00:20:30.888 --> 00:20:32.422
You just don't come in
off the street


444
00:20:32.489 --> 00:20:34.091
and say, "I'd like
some food stamps,"


445
00:20:34.158 --> 00:20:35.993
and then they give you
some food stamps.


446
00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.394
It happens to be

447
00:20:37.461 --> 00:20:39.697
a very difficult
and complicated process.


448
00:20:39.764 --> 00:20:41.732
I'm sure you can handle it,
sweetie.


449
00:20:41.799 --> 00:20:43.067
I don't know.

450
00:20:43.133 --> 00:20:44.301
You getting this job

451
00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:46.236
might have screwed up
our eligibility.


452
00:20:50.307 --> 00:20:52.710
Oh, Spot,
will you shut up?


453
00:20:54.712 --> 00:20:57.715
It's all politics, man,
all politics.


454
00:20:57.782 --> 00:20:59.750
You don't have to
worry about it.


455
00:20:59.817 --> 00:21:00.751
Come on.

456
00:21:11.161 --> 00:21:12.429
Ah...

457
00:21:12.496 --> 00:21:13.631
Ah-ha!

458
00:21:13.698 --> 00:21:14.865
Yeah, yeah, so?

459
00:21:14.932 --> 00:21:16.433
So a guy comes
to your house...


460
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.135
Wait a second.
Wait a second.


461
00:21:18.202 --> 00:21:19.236
A guy comes to my house?

462
00:21:19.303 --> 00:21:21.138
He wants to see
where you got to cook.


463
00:21:21.205 --> 00:21:23.273
He wants to see
if you're telling the truth


464
00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.809
about how many people
you've got living there.


465
00:21:24.875 --> 00:21:26.711
All right, all right.
A guy comes to my house...


466
00:21:26.777 --> 00:21:28.412
First, you have to
fill out the forms.


467
00:21:28.478 --> 00:21:29.346
Tell him
about the forms.


468
00:21:29.413 --> 00:21:30.447
What about the forms?

469
00:21:30.514 --> 00:21:32.082
Then you get
the buy vouchers,


470
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:34.251
which you take to a place
that sells, uh...


471
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.922
Are these guys
putting me on?


472
00:21:37.988 --> 00:21:39.456
You want to know how
to get food stamps, right?


473
00:21:39.523 --> 00:21:40.658
Yeah.

474
00:21:40.725 --> 00:21:41.959
So we're trying
to explain.


475
00:21:42.026 --> 00:21:43.293
What do you think,

476
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.596
it's dinner for two
at Trader Vics?


477
00:21:45.663 --> 00:21:46.997
All right, all right,

478
00:21:47.064 --> 00:21:48.332
so after the visits
and after the forms,


479
00:21:48.398 --> 00:21:49.600
how much do I get?

480
00:21:49.667 --> 00:21:51.535
Excuse me.
I'm going to explain.


481
00:21:53.671 --> 00:21:55.239
Por favor.

482
00:21:58.876 --> 00:22:00.244
Now you're going to put down

483
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.812
you got just one wife
and one kid, right?


484
00:22:01.879 --> 00:22:04.281
Yeah. Any of you guys
have more than one wife?


485
00:22:04.348 --> 00:22:06.316
Give him the one
wife and kid.


486
00:22:06.383 --> 00:22:08.185
One wife...

487
00:22:08.252 --> 00:22:09.754
and one kid,

488
00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.122
and you're getting your
unemployment now, right?


489
00:22:12.189 --> 00:22:13.891
How much do I get?

490
00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:15.325
You get 108 bucks worth
a month.


491
00:22:15.392 --> 00:22:17.061
Imigracion!

492
00:22:22.232 --> 00:22:23.500
Something I said?

493
00:22:23.567 --> 00:22:24.902
Just a couple
Immigration Police


494
00:22:24.969 --> 00:22:26.470
coming in
to check things out.


495
00:22:26.536 --> 00:22:28.105
Oh.

496
00:22:29.874 --> 00:22:32.977
Hey, Francisco,
dos cervezas, por favor.


497
00:22:35.545 --> 00:22:36.747
Okay, Pancho,

498
00:22:36.814 --> 00:22:38.115
let's see your
immigration card.


499
00:22:38.182 --> 00:22:39.183
Huh?

500
00:22:39.249 --> 00:22:40.550
Don't play games.
Your card.


501
00:22:40.617 --> 00:22:42.653
Hey, man,
he's an aerospace executive.


502
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.954
He sends people to the moon.

503
00:22:44.021 --> 00:22:46.123
Yeah, and I'm
Flash Gordon.


504
00:22:49.593 --> 00:22:51.028
What, are you crazy?

505
00:22:51.095 --> 00:22:52.296
You got those beers?

506
00:22:52.362 --> 00:22:53.998
All right, buddy, come on.
You're going downtown.


507
00:22:54.064 --> 00:22:56.000
Listen, I'm not your buddy,
and I don't speak Spanish.


508
00:22:56.066 --> 00:22:57.534
Really?
That's what they all say.


509
00:22:57.601 --> 00:22:59.103
Yeah, because I said cerveza
and po r favor?


510
00:22:59.169 --> 00:23:00.604
Everybody says por favor.

511
00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:02.707
How about vaya con dios?

512
00:23:05.442 --> 00:23:06.677
Oh, Paula,

513
00:23:06.744 --> 00:23:08.112
I don't have
the same shoes.


514
00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:09.146
Oh, honey,

515
00:23:09.213 --> 00:23:10.614
they're always sending
mismatches.


516
00:23:10.681 --> 00:23:12.182
Uh, where are the falsies?

517
00:23:12.249 --> 00:23:15.119
They're in the box
over there on the chair.


518
00:23:15.185 --> 00:23:16.854
Here, just stick this
in your heel.


519
00:23:16.921 --> 00:23:18.055
That ought to do it,

520
00:23:18.122 --> 00:23:19.356
and don't worry,

521
00:23:19.423 --> 00:23:21.191
after all,
modeling is nothing more


522
00:23:21.258 --> 00:23:22.993
but organized walking.

523
00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.129
Hey, you're on.

524
00:23:25.195 --> 00:23:27.431
Come on.

525
00:23:51.621 --> 00:23:53.090
Oh...

526
00:23:53.157 --> 00:23:55.692
I'm...I'm terribly sorry.

527
00:23:56.894 --> 00:23:59.263
How much is this, please?

528
00:23:59.329 --> 00:24:00.731
$185.

529
00:24:00.798 --> 00:24:02.933
185?

530
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.903
Miss! Miss!

531
00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:07.537
How much
is this dress?


532
00:24:07.604 --> 00:24:09.239
It's a nightgown.

533
00:24:09.306 --> 00:24:11.241
I don't know anyway, though.
I'm sorry.


534
00:24:11.308 --> 00:24:13.643
You don't know?
What a klutz.


535
00:24:26.991 --> 00:24:28.793
Who is she?

536
00:24:28.859 --> 00:24:31.728
Some friend of the
fashion coordinator's.


537
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.638
Hello, Jane.

538
00:25:14.704 --> 00:25:16.473
Oh, my God, Dick,
what have you done?


539
00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.175
A guy by the name
of Jim Weeks


540
00:25:18.242 --> 00:25:19.476
is coming to lunch.

541
00:25:19.543 --> 00:25:21.711
He wants to talk to me
about a job.


542
00:25:21.778 --> 00:25:23.680
Where did you get
the money?


543
00:25:23.747 --> 00:25:25.149
I've got friends.

544
00:25:25.215 --> 00:25:27.384
We'll tell him
you're on a diet.


545
00:25:27.451 --> 00:25:29.586
Well, why don't we tell him
you're on a diet?


546
00:25:29.653 --> 00:25:31.021
This is not fun, Jane.

547
00:25:31.088 --> 00:25:33.357
This is serious.

548
00:25:33.423 --> 00:25:35.659
Do you really think
he's going to offer you a job?


549
00:25:35.725 --> 00:25:37.527
As long as he thinks
I don't need one.


550
00:25:37.594 --> 00:25:39.129
I know those bastards.

551
00:25:40.297 --> 00:25:41.198
Yech.

552
00:25:41.265 --> 00:25:43.333
Yeah, that's funny.

553
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.302
That's funny.

554
00:25:45.369 --> 00:25:47.037
What are you
going to do?


555
00:25:47.104 --> 00:25:48.772
Okay, what is it?

556
00:25:48.839 --> 00:25:50.540
An Eskimo peeing.

557
00:25:50.607 --> 00:25:52.309
An Eskimo peeing!

558
00:25:54.478 --> 00:25:56.246
Oh, Jane, it's
absolutely lovely.


559
00:25:56.313 --> 00:25:58.582
I just wished you
could have joined us,


560
00:25:58.648 --> 00:26:00.517
that's all.

561
00:26:00.584 --> 00:26:03.020
Oh, is that funny.

562
00:26:03.087 --> 00:26:04.554
Honey, could we have
some coffee


563
00:26:04.621 --> 00:26:05.956
in the living room?

564
00:26:06.023 --> 00:26:07.724
Certainly.

565
00:26:07.791 --> 00:26:09.093
Shall we repair, Jim?

566
00:26:09.159 --> 00:26:12.429
Oh, I think that's
a hell of an idea.


567
00:26:12.496 --> 00:26:14.098
That's very funny.

568
00:26:14.164 --> 00:26:15.265
Make yourself comfortable.

569
00:26:15.332 --> 00:26:16.333
Thank you, Dick.
Thank you.


570
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.035
You know,
I love your house.


571
00:26:18.102 --> 00:26:19.970
It's solid.
It's a real home.


572
00:26:20.037 --> 00:26:21.171
Not much.

573
00:26:21.238 --> 00:26:23.273
Thank you, Jim.
We like it.


574
00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.674
Thank you.

575
00:26:24.741 --> 00:26:26.776
It does tend to grow
a little confining,


576
00:26:26.843 --> 00:26:27.844
you know?

577
00:26:27.912 --> 00:26:29.079
Oh, I do, I do.

578
00:26:30.747 --> 00:26:32.216
Look, Dick,

579
00:26:32.282 --> 00:26:34.218
I'm not going to beat
around the bush with you.


580
00:26:34.284 --> 00:26:35.619
We like you.

581
00:26:35.685 --> 00:26:37.121
We like your style.

582
00:26:37.187 --> 00:26:38.255
Thank you, Jim.

583
00:26:38.322 --> 00:26:40.324
We like your mind.

584
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:41.791
Thank you.

585
00:26:41.858 --> 00:26:44.929
But we can't pay you the money
you've been getting at Taft...


586
00:26:46.296 --> 00:26:48.432
I mean, not in
straight salary, that is.


587
00:26:50.167 --> 00:26:51.768
30 thou.

588
00:26:53.037 --> 00:26:55.439
That's our top.

589
00:26:55.505 --> 00:26:57.107
30, eh?

590
00:27:00.377 --> 00:27:02.046
Gee, I don't know, Jim, uh...

591
00:27:02.112 --> 00:27:04.048
Well, if you
play ball with us,


592
00:27:04.114 --> 00:27:05.049
why, I tell you,

593
00:27:05.115 --> 00:27:06.650
the sky is the limit.

594
00:27:06.716 --> 00:27:08.785
It's attractive, Jim,
it's damn attractive,


595
00:27:08.852 --> 00:27:11.021
but I've got several irons
in the fire now,


596
00:27:11.088 --> 00:27:13.023
and I'd like to
think about it.


597
00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:14.091
Oh, sure, sure,
think about it.


598
00:27:14.158 --> 00:27:15.759
Thank you, Jane.

599
00:27:15.825 --> 00:27:17.194
I'm not trying to rush you.
I wouldn't even dream of it.


600
00:27:17.261 --> 00:27:19.129
I like to consider
the complete picture.


601
00:27:19.196 --> 00:27:20.797
Sure, sure,

602
00:27:20.864 --> 00:27:23.467
consider
the complete picture,


603
00:27:23.533 --> 00:27:25.002
but printed circuits,
not rocket ships, Dick.


604
00:27:25.069 --> 00:27:27.938
Collecting and storing
information


605
00:27:28.005 --> 00:27:29.639
right here
on Mother Earth,


606
00:27:29.706 --> 00:27:30.874
that's the future,

607
00:27:30.941 --> 00:27:33.143
and any man

608
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.312
with a thought
about industry


609
00:27:35.379 --> 00:27:36.580
in 10 years' time,

610
00:27:36.646 --> 00:27:37.881
any man thinking
about tomorrow,


611
00:27:37.948 --> 00:27:39.916
will say goodbye
to aerospace today.


612
00:27:42.419 --> 00:27:44.054
What are you doing, Jane?

613
00:27:44.121 --> 00:27:45.322
I'm just closing
the shutters, Dick.


614
00:27:45.389 --> 00:27:46.390
Why don't you take
Mr. Weeks out


615
00:27:46.456 --> 00:27:47.524
to see the backyard?

616
00:27:47.591 --> 00:27:49.226
Backyard?

617
00:27:49.293 --> 00:27:50.727
Open up the door,
Mrs. Harper,


618
00:27:50.794 --> 00:27:52.329
or we're going to huff
and we're going to puff


619
00:27:52.396 --> 00:27:54.999
and we're going to blow
your house down.


620
00:27:56.433 --> 00:27:58.702
We want the indoor plants,
deadbeat.


621
00:27:58.768 --> 00:27:59.970
Plants ain't free

622
00:28:00.037 --> 00:28:01.171
just because
they grow on trees,


623
00:28:01.238 --> 00:28:02.472
deadbeat.

624
00:28:02.539 --> 00:28:04.074
I know you're in there,
deadbeat.


625
00:28:04.141 --> 00:28:05.976
Excuse me, Jim.

626
00:28:07.577 --> 00:28:08.845
You can't buy
a rubber plant


627
00:28:08.912 --> 00:28:10.480
with a rubber check,
Harper.


628
00:28:10.547 --> 00:28:13.150
I know you're in there,
deadbeat.


629
00:28:13.217 --> 00:28:14.551
Hey, what the hell's
going on here?


630
00:28:14.618 --> 00:28:16.353
We've come for our plants,
deadbeat.


631
00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.654
I'm having a meeting.

632
00:28:17.721 --> 00:28:19.156
You can't
come in here now.


633
00:28:19.223 --> 00:28:20.190
I can't?

634
00:28:20.257 --> 00:28:22.092
Okay, Tippy.

635
00:28:22.159 --> 00:28:23.793
Excuse me.

636
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:27.464
"Jane," she asked,

637
00:28:27.531 --> 00:28:29.166
"Would you care
for a cognac"?


638
00:28:29.233 --> 00:28:30.700
"Yes, thank you
very much.


639
00:28:30.767 --> 00:28:32.302
I'd like one desperately."

640
00:28:33.637 --> 00:28:35.205
Watch it, lady.

641
00:28:40.777 --> 00:28:42.579
Hey, Igo,

642
00:28:42.646 --> 00:28:44.614
could you do something
about that tree?


643
00:28:44.681 --> 00:28:47.184
Yes, sir.

644
00:28:54.991 --> 00:28:57.227
Afternoon, Harper.

645
00:28:57.294 --> 00:28:59.796
Hello, Nesbit.

646
00:28:59.863 --> 00:29:01.265
You know, uh...

647
00:29:01.331 --> 00:29:02.932
the wind's been
kicking up your yard


648
00:29:02.999 --> 00:29:05.469
and blowing it
into our windows.


649
00:29:05.535 --> 00:29:07.237
I'm going to seed it.

650
00:29:11.208 --> 00:29:13.577
You're having
a garage sale?


651
00:29:13.643 --> 00:29:15.979
Uh, yeah,
odds and ends.


652
00:29:16.046 --> 00:29:19.049
Declassé, Harper,
très declassé.


653
00:29:19.116 --> 00:29:20.317
I mean, it brings
all the riffraff


654
00:29:20.384 --> 00:29:21.318
in the neighborhood.

655
00:29:21.385 --> 00:29:22.686
You know what I mean.

656
00:29:28.192 --> 00:29:29.526
Hey, man,

657
00:29:29.593 --> 00:29:31.961
the opera's coming
to town next Tuesday.


658
00:29:32.028 --> 00:29:33.230
So what?

659
00:29:33.297 --> 00:29:35.432
So 40 bucks
a night, man, cash.


660
00:29:35.499 --> 00:29:36.933
Can you sing?

661
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.268
Hell, no.

662
00:29:38.335 --> 00:29:39.403
All you've got to do
is stand around


663
00:29:39.469 --> 00:29:40.604
while the rest of them sing.

664
00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:41.905
Sometimes you carry a spear,

665
00:29:41.971 --> 00:29:43.240
other times,
you hold the elephant.


666
00:29:43.307 --> 00:29:44.641
It's real easy, man.

667
00:29:45.709 --> 00:29:46.876
Excuse me, Nesbit.

668
00:29:46.943 --> 00:29:48.878
Private matter
to discuss.


669
00:29:51.281 --> 00:29:53.650
What about unemployment?

670
00:29:53.717 --> 00:29:55.152
We don't tell them, man.

671
00:29:55.219 --> 00:29:56.386
Suppose they find out?

672
00:29:56.453 --> 00:29:58.155
Hey, how are they
going to find out?


673
00:29:58.222 --> 00:29:59.423
They pay us in cash, Jim.

674
00:29:59.489 --> 00:30:00.957
There's no papers,
nothing.


675
00:30:01.024 --> 00:30:02.426
No way
they'll find out.


676
00:30:02.492 --> 00:30:03.960
You mean I'm going to be
a welfare chiseler?


677
00:30:04.027 --> 00:30:05.662
Hey, hey, hey,
look, man,


678
00:30:05.729 --> 00:30:07.097
a welfare chiseler

679
00:30:07.164 --> 00:30:08.565
is just some bum
who doesn't want to work.


680
00:30:08.632 --> 00:30:09.733
We want to work, don't we?

681
00:30:09.799 --> 00:30:11.135
Yeah, but the rules say

682
00:30:11.201 --> 00:30:13.069
you can't work
and collect unemployment.


683
00:30:13.137 --> 00:30:14.938
You can't always go
by the rules, man.


684
00:30:15.004 --> 00:30:17.073
There are times when you have
to run some heavy numbers.


685
00:30:17.141 --> 00:30:18.975
"When in the course
of human events,"


686
00:30:19.042 --> 00:30:20.043
you know what I mean?

687
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.311
And how about those guys

688
00:30:21.378 --> 00:30:22.712
like Rockefeller
and Dupont?


689
00:30:22.779 --> 00:30:24.047
Do you think
they let a few crummy rules


690
00:30:24.114 --> 00:30:25.349
stand in their way?

691
00:30:25.415 --> 00:30:26.816
That's
the whole enchilada


692
00:30:26.883 --> 00:30:29.085
that made
this country great, man.


693
00:30:29.153 --> 00:30:30.787
I never thought of it
like that.


694
00:30:30.854 --> 00:30:32.088
Well, you'd better
start thinking


695
00:30:32.156 --> 00:30:33.457
about these things, man.

696
00:30:33.523 --> 00:30:34.324
I ain't no deadbeat
welfare chiseler,


697
00:30:34.391 --> 00:30:35.725
and neither are you.

698
00:30:36.226 --> 00:30:37.427
I'm sorry.

699
00:30:37.494 --> 00:30:40.130
That's okay, man.

700
00:31:06.756 --> 00:31:07.624
Cool it.

701
00:31:07.691 --> 00:31:09.226
Cool it, cool it.

702
00:31:35.619 --> 00:31:37.787
Cool it.
That's enough.


703
00:32:08.685 --> 00:32:11.120
So you didn't work last week,
Mr. Harper?


704
00:32:11.187 --> 00:32:12.656
That's right.

705
00:32:12.722 --> 00:32:14.057
That's funny.

706
00:32:14.123 --> 00:32:15.925
I caught your gypsy act
the other night.


707
00:32:15.992 --> 00:32:17.394
Divine.

708
00:32:17.461 --> 00:32:19.696
Too bad I won't see you
for three years.


709
00:32:20.964 --> 00:32:22.732
No unemployment
for three years.


710
00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:23.867
I can't believe it.

711
00:32:23.933 --> 00:32:25.502
Hey, you've got to look
on the positive side.


712
00:32:25.569 --> 00:32:27.003
They could have
sent you to jail.


713
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.005
Unemployment's
the only thing we had.


714
00:32:29.072 --> 00:32:30.707
What am I
going to tell Jane?


715
00:32:30.774 --> 00:32:32.309
I wouldn't tell her.

716
00:32:38.548 --> 00:32:39.883
Hello, dear.

717
00:32:39.949 --> 00:32:41.385
Hi, Mom.

718
00:32:41.451 --> 00:32:42.686
Oh, we're just fine.

719
00:32:42.752 --> 00:32:45.255
It is so nice
to see you.


720
00:32:45.322 --> 00:32:47.291
Oh, how thoughtful.

721
00:32:47.357 --> 00:32:49.426
Well, your father's
waiting to see you.


722
00:32:51.127 --> 00:32:52.529
Hi, Dad.

723
00:32:52.596 --> 00:32:54.230
Jane brought us
some flowers, dear.


724
00:32:54.298 --> 00:32:55.832
Hello, Jane.

725
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:02.572
Would you like
a cup of tea, dear?


726
00:33:02.639 --> 00:33:04.808
Oh, no thanks, Mom.

727
00:33:04.874 --> 00:33:06.510
Over here.

728
00:33:11.948 --> 00:33:14.751
I discussed your phone call
with your mother yesterday


729
00:33:14.818 --> 00:33:17.153
after I hung up.

730
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.222
"What does she want
to see us about?"


731
00:33:19.289 --> 00:33:20.890
Didn't I say that,
Mother?


732
00:33:20.957 --> 00:33:22.125
Yes.

733
00:33:22.191 --> 00:33:23.159
Something
you couldn't discuss


734
00:33:23.226 --> 00:33:24.928
over the phone,
you said.


735
00:33:24.994 --> 00:33:26.596
Yes, that's right, Dad.

736
00:33:26.663 --> 00:33:31.568
Well, I narrowed it down
to three possibilities...


737
00:33:31.635 --> 00:33:34.871
health, emotion, or money.

738
00:33:35.905 --> 00:33:37.140
Let's take health.

739
00:33:37.206 --> 00:33:39.309
Is there someone ill?

740
00:33:39.376 --> 00:33:40.310
Oh...

741
00:33:40.377 --> 00:33:42.479
No. I ruled that out myself,

742
00:33:42.546 --> 00:33:45.849
because I distinctly remember
asking about everyone's health,


743
00:33:45.915 --> 00:33:48.618
and your answer was positive
without hesitation...


744
00:33:50.086 --> 00:33:53.122
which brings us to emotion...

745
00:33:54.791 --> 00:33:57.361
at your age,
a euphemism for "divorce."


746
00:33:58.662 --> 00:34:00.597
Well, you never came
to see us


747
00:34:00.664 --> 00:34:02.466
to talk about
marrying him,


748
00:34:02.532 --> 00:34:03.733
so why should you come

749
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.669
to talk about
divorcing him?


750
00:34:05.735 --> 00:34:07.871
No, a divorce
can be handled


751
00:34:07.937 --> 00:34:10.740
in a phone call,
so...


752
00:34:12.175 --> 00:34:13.309
it's money.

753
00:34:13.377 --> 00:34:14.778
You're broke.

754
00:34:14.844 --> 00:34:16.279
That's it, isn't it?

755
00:34:16.346 --> 00:34:18.047
Whoever said
Sherlock Holmes was dead,


756
00:34:18.114 --> 00:34:19.215
eh, Mom?

757
00:34:19.282 --> 00:34:21.050
I was right, Mother.

758
00:34:21.117 --> 00:34:22.919
They're broke.

759
00:34:22.986 --> 00:34:26.022
Dick hasn't had a job
in over three months, Dad.


760
00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:28.692
Why didn't you tell us
before, dear?


761
00:34:28.758 --> 00:34:30.827
Well, we were sure
he could get another job, Mom,


762
00:34:30.894 --> 00:34:33.029
and we didn't want
to worry you.


763
00:34:33.096 --> 00:34:35.198
I unloaded all
of my aerospace stock


764
00:34:35.264 --> 00:34:36.733
the day they first
landed on the moon.


765
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.169
I knew that was the peak,
and I was right.


766
00:34:40.236 --> 00:34:42.238
It's a depressed
industry.


767
00:34:42.305 --> 00:34:44.441
Depressed and depressing.

768
00:34:44.508 --> 00:34:45.775
I was right

769
00:34:45.842 --> 00:34:47.276
about the aerospace
stocks, Mother.


770
00:34:47.343 --> 00:34:49.345
You certainly were.

771
00:34:49.413 --> 00:34:51.715
Jane...

772
00:34:51.781 --> 00:34:53.650
I'll make it easier for you.

773
00:34:53.717 --> 00:34:56.119
You've come here
to borrow money, haven't you?


774
00:34:57.454 --> 00:34:58.655
Yes, Dad.

775
00:34:58.722 --> 00:34:59.889
Oh.

776
00:34:59.956 --> 00:35:01.625
Well, I'd love
to help you,


777
00:35:01.691 --> 00:35:03.460
I really would,

778
00:35:03.527 --> 00:35:05.028
but I can't.

779
00:35:05.094 --> 00:35:07.664
I'm just opposed
to borrowing or lending


780
00:35:07.731 --> 00:35:09.433
on principle.

781
00:35:09.499 --> 00:35:11.200
Self-reliance,

782
00:35:11.267 --> 00:35:13.336
it's like a...

783
00:35:13.403 --> 00:35:15.338
religious thing to me.

784
00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.742
Ralph Waldo Emerson,

785
00:35:18.808 --> 00:35:21.678
he is like my God.

786
00:35:21.745 --> 00:35:24.981
"Need breaks iron."
That's what he said.


787
00:35:25.048 --> 00:35:27.551
Well, it certainly
broke us, Dad.


788
00:35:27.617 --> 00:35:28.985
I told Mother
for years


789
00:35:29.052 --> 00:35:30.086
that both of you
have been living


790
00:35:30.153 --> 00:35:31.187
far beyond your means.

791
00:35:31.254 --> 00:35:32.789
Nothing,
just nothing at all


792
00:35:32.856 --> 00:35:35.191
set aside
for a rainy day.


793
00:35:35.258 --> 00:35:36.960
All right...

794
00:35:37.026 --> 00:35:39.529
it's the monsoon season,

795
00:35:39.596 --> 00:35:43.332
you're standing outside
in torn raincoats.


796
00:35:44.634 --> 00:35:47.170
Come through this
by yourselves,


797
00:35:47.236 --> 00:35:49.539
and you'll be dry
for the rest of your lives.


798
00:35:49.606 --> 00:35:53.109
Take money from me,
and you'll be wet, soaking wet,


799
00:35:53.176 --> 00:35:54.744
from now on.

800
00:35:54.811 --> 00:35:57.614
Jane, this is the best thing
that could have happened,


801
00:35:57.681 --> 00:36:00.183
especially for Dick.

802
00:36:00.249 --> 00:36:04.588
I'm so happy for both of you,
especially for Dick.


803
00:36:04.654 --> 00:36:06.255
What about Billy?

804
00:36:06.322 --> 00:36:07.691
Well, when I was his age,

805
00:36:07.757 --> 00:36:09.358
I remember Mr. Nostic
gave me...


806
00:36:09.425 --> 00:36:10.960
Dad?

807
00:36:11.027 --> 00:36:12.395
My first paper route.

808
00:36:12.462 --> 00:36:15.565
Dad! I've heard
that story already.


809
00:36:15.632 --> 00:36:17.767
Dad, Billy is doing his
homework by candlelight.


810
00:36:17.834 --> 00:36:20.737
Splendid.
So did Abraham Lincoln.


811
00:36:28.077 --> 00:36:29.713
How are you both doing?

812
00:36:29.779 --> 00:36:31.447
Mmm...

813
00:36:31.515 --> 00:36:32.816
never better.

814
00:36:32.882 --> 00:36:36.352
Jane, we have sowed
all of our lives,


815
00:36:36.419 --> 00:36:40.189
and we're now
reaping the harvest.


816
00:36:40.256 --> 00:36:44.193
Reap, reap, reap.

817
00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:48.397
I seem to feel
a monsoon dripping in.


818
00:36:48.464 --> 00:36:53.169
It was nice
to see you again, Dad.


819
00:36:53.236 --> 00:36:54.370
Bye, Mom.

820
00:36:54.437 --> 00:36:56.172
Goodbye, dear.

821
00:36:56.239 --> 00:37:00.544
You tell Dick
that he's a lucky man.


822
00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:04.480
Not everybody gets
a real chance to be tested.


823
00:37:04.548 --> 00:37:07.517
You tell him
that I'm jealous.


824
00:37:07.584 --> 00:37:09.586
I'm sure he'll be really
thrilled, Dad.


825
00:37:09.653 --> 00:37:13.590
Don't forget to tell him
that I'm jealous too.


826
00:37:16.593 --> 00:37:18.995
So long.

827
00:37:21.565 --> 00:37:22.932
Bye-bye.

828
00:37:30.339 --> 00:37:31.407
Mm-mm.

829
00:37:31.474 --> 00:37:33.910
Mmm.

830
00:37:36.746 --> 00:37:39.015
Oh.

831
00:37:39.082 --> 00:37:42.085
Oh-oh.

832
00:37:42.151 --> 00:37:44.053
Ha ha ha ha.

833
00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.089
Mm-mm.

834
00:37:46.155 --> 00:37:47.056
Ah.

835
00:37:47.123 --> 00:37:49.993
Mister, you've got problems.

836
00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:51.427
Why do you think
we're here?


837
00:37:51.494 --> 00:37:53.196
I know why you're here.

838
00:37:53.262 --> 00:37:55.832
You got guts.
I'll give you that.


839
00:37:55.899 --> 00:37:57.066
Your ad says that

840
00:37:57.133 --> 00:37:58.501
if you've been turned
down elsewhere...


841
00:37:58.568 --> 00:38:00.436
It didn't say if you were
turned down everywhere.


842
00:38:00.503 --> 00:38:01.938
This is the first place
we've been.


843
00:38:02.005 --> 00:38:03.039
Lucky us.

844
00:38:03.106 --> 00:38:04.340
Hey, listen, you know,

845
00:38:04.407 --> 00:38:05.875
I mean, there's lots of places
we can go for abuse.


846
00:38:05.942 --> 00:38:07.343
Come on, Dick.

847
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:08.845
Did I say I wasn't going to
give you money?


848
00:38:08.912 --> 00:38:10.647
Did I say that?
Sit down.


849
00:38:13.382 --> 00:38:14.718
Let's look at the pluses
and minuses.


850
00:38:14.784 --> 00:38:15.719
There are a couple.

851
00:38:15.785 --> 00:38:17.954
We'll start with the minuses.

852
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:24.160
You two are in hock
up to your eyes,


853
00:38:24.227 --> 00:38:26.963
you have nothing serious
for collateral,


854
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:28.798
you're behind
on both your mortgages,


855
00:38:28.865 --> 00:38:30.066
so we're going to be
third in line


856
00:38:30.133 --> 00:38:32.335
behind the bank.

857
00:38:32.401 --> 00:38:34.604
And your car is paid for,

858
00:38:34.671 --> 00:38:37.073
but that car and a dime
would get you a cup of coffee.


859
00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.542
That's a perfectly good
late-model car


860
00:38:39.609 --> 00:38:41.210
worth at least
a thousand dollars.


861
00:38:41.277 --> 00:38:44.881
You also have some jewelry,
might be worth a few bucks.


862
00:38:44.948 --> 00:38:47.116
That car's worth
at least nine hundred.


863
00:38:47.183 --> 00:38:48.551
I haven't come to the pluses.

864
00:38:48.618 --> 00:38:50.319
Will you wait for me
to come to the pluses?


865
00:38:50.386 --> 00:38:52.355
Okay.

866
00:38:52.421 --> 00:38:56.059
On the plus side,

867
00:38:56.125 --> 00:38:59.428
you, Mrs. Harper,
are actually working.


868
00:38:59.495 --> 00:39:01.765
Yes. Getting paid bupkis,
but you're working,


869
00:39:01.831 --> 00:39:02.832
it's regular,

870
00:39:02.899 --> 00:39:04.100
and you...

871
00:39:05.635 --> 00:39:07.136
you could get another job.

872
00:39:07.203 --> 00:39:08.571
Who knows?

873
00:39:08.638 --> 00:39:10.640
They might find
a cure for cancer, right?


874
00:39:10.707 --> 00:39:12.642
Will you get to
the bottom line?


875
00:39:12.709 --> 00:39:15.378
The bottom line
is that I love people,


876
00:39:15.444 --> 00:39:17.747
so I'm going to
let you have...


877
00:39:21.017 --> 00:39:23.753
$1,000 for one year
at 18 and a half compounded.


878
00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.655
A thousand dollars?

879
00:39:25.722 --> 00:39:27.757
18 and a half?
That's against the law.


880
00:39:27.824 --> 00:39:28.992
Take it or leave it.

881
00:39:29.058 --> 00:39:30.660
We'll take it!
We'll leave it!


882
00:39:30.727 --> 00:39:33.596
We'll leave it.
We'll take it!


883
00:39:33.663 --> 00:39:35.932
Seven...eight...nine...1,000.

884
00:39:35.999 --> 00:39:38.702
Thank you.

885
00:39:42.005 --> 00:39:43.272
All right,
this is a holdup.


886
00:39:43.339 --> 00:39:44.741
If nobody moves,
nobody gets hurt.


887
00:39:44.808 --> 00:39:46.242
Everybody lie down.
Hands over your heads.


888
00:39:46.309 --> 00:39:47.376
You said
nobody should move.


889
00:39:47.443 --> 00:39:48.444
Shut up.

890
00:39:48.511 --> 00:39:49.813
I wouldn't do anything
to offend you.


891
00:39:49.879 --> 00:39:52.115
I told you to lie down
and shut up.


892
00:39:59.689 --> 00:40:02.291
Come on, man.

893
00:40:06.429 --> 00:40:07.563
I just borrowed this.

894
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:08.765
Well, now you're
loaning it.


895
00:40:08.832 --> 00:40:09.833
Borrow it from him.

896
00:40:09.899 --> 00:40:11.000
This is legally yours.

897
00:40:11.067 --> 00:40:12.335
I'm paying it back.

898
00:40:12.401 --> 00:40:13.636
What's the interest
on two minutes?


899
00:40:13.703 --> 00:40:14.537
You already
signed the papers.


900
00:40:14.603 --> 00:40:15.739
Shut up.

901
00:40:15.805 --> 00:40:17.073
Can't we just
clear this up?


902
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.341
Who are you
stealing this from?


903
00:40:18.407 --> 00:40:21.477
Shut up.

904
00:40:21.544 --> 00:40:22.445
What was that?

905
00:40:22.511 --> 00:40:24.313
Uh, it...it was me.
My gun went off.


906
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:26.182
Christ, that'll bring
all the heat in the world.


907
00:40:26.249 --> 00:40:27.283
Did you get the money?

908
00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:28.417
Yeah.

909
00:40:28.484 --> 00:40:29.719
Get the broad.

910
00:40:29.786 --> 00:40:31.387
Let...let...
let's get out of here.


911
00:40:31.454 --> 00:40:32.789
Come on, lady,
up on your feet.


912
00:40:32.856 --> 00:40:34.623
You're coming with us.
Hey, hold it.


913
00:40:44.934 --> 00:40:46.035
Where the hell are they?

914
00:40:46.102 --> 00:40:47.436
They went out the back,

915
00:40:47.503 --> 00:40:49.372
and they've got a woman
with them.


916
00:40:49.438 --> 00:40:52.041
Come on! Get up!

917
00:40:52.108 --> 00:40:53.409
Hold it. Police.

918
00:40:53.476 --> 00:40:54.377
Get up!

919
00:40:54.443 --> 00:40:55.745
Wait, man.

920
00:41:04.553 --> 00:41:05.822
Are you sure
you're all right?


921
00:41:05.889 --> 00:41:07.123
You don't want to go
to the hospital?


922
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:08.958
I'm all right.
Jane, are you?


923
00:41:09.025 --> 00:41:10.593
I'd just like
to go home.


924
00:41:10.659 --> 00:41:12.028
Well, you're free to go.

925
00:41:12.095 --> 00:41:13.930
You sure were cool
under fire, ma'am.


926
00:41:13.997 --> 00:41:17.533
Oh, I'll faint at home,
thanks.


927
00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.435
Oh, sorry.

928
00:41:19.502 --> 00:41:21.070
Uh, Mr. Harper...

929
00:41:21.137 --> 00:41:23.706
uh, how much did you
tell them that you lost?


930
00:41:23.773 --> 00:41:25.374
A thousand dollars.
What do you mean?


931
00:41:25.441 --> 00:41:26.843
You couldn't tell them

932
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:28.477
The insurance company
would have paid,


933
00:41:28.544 --> 00:41:30.146
and I would have split
the extra grand with you.


934
00:41:30.213 --> 00:41:31.948
Schmuck.

935
00:41:37.253 --> 00:41:38.788
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

936
00:41:38.855 --> 00:41:40.389
Billy, are you going
to play outside for a while?


937
00:41:40.456 --> 00:41:41.424
Yeah.

938
00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:42.358
Hi, Bill.

939
00:41:42.425 --> 00:41:44.427
Hi.

940
00:41:48.231 --> 00:41:50.499
Are you feeling
all right?


941
00:41:50.566 --> 00:41:53.002
Come in
and close the door.


942
00:41:55.204 --> 00:41:56.906
Lock it.

943
00:42:00.176 --> 00:42:02.045
They dropped it
and I fell on it,


944
00:42:02.111 --> 00:42:03.512
and while the police
were chasing them,


945
00:42:03.579 --> 00:42:05.148
I put it in my bag.

946
00:42:05.214 --> 00:42:07.183
Oh, my God!

947
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:08.651
I don't know
what happened to me.


948
00:42:08.717 --> 00:42:10.353
I just did it.

949
00:42:10.419 --> 00:42:11.955
There's $2,000 here.

950
00:42:12.021 --> 00:42:13.289
I can't believe I did it.

951
00:42:13.356 --> 00:42:15.458
Ha ha ha.
Neither can I.


952
00:42:15.524 --> 00:42:17.126
Dick, it's not funny.
I've committed a crime.


953
00:42:17.193 --> 00:42:18.794
And done
a hell of a job at it.


954
00:42:18.862 --> 00:42:20.930
Oh...

955
00:42:20.997 --> 00:42:22.531
I don't know why
I didn't give it back.


956
00:42:22.598 --> 00:42:24.667
Do you know it
never even occurred to me


957
00:42:24.733 --> 00:42:25.835
to give it back?

958
00:42:25.902 --> 00:42:26.836
You are sensational.

959
00:42:26.903 --> 00:42:28.671
Oh, stop it, Dick.

960
00:42:28.737 --> 00:42:31.440
Would you turn on
the faucet?


961
00:42:31.507 --> 00:42:33.209
I'm going to
give it back.


962
00:42:33.276 --> 00:42:35.244
To who, the robbers?

963
00:42:35.311 --> 00:42:38.347
The money belongs
to the loan...


964
00:42:38.414 --> 00:42:40.183
They have insurance,
don't they?


965
00:42:40.249 --> 00:42:41.584
Exactly.

966
00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:42.952
Yeah, but suppose
they catch those guys.


967
00:42:43.019 --> 00:42:44.253
I mean, they saw me take it.

968
00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.621
They're never
going to catch them,


969
00:42:45.688 --> 00:42:47.256
and besides,
even if they finger you,


970
00:42:47.323 --> 00:42:48.624
who's going to believe them?

971
00:42:48.691 --> 00:42:50.526
That's right. The cops are
never going to believe them.


972
00:42:50.593 --> 00:42:52.261
They're going to just think
that they spent it all.


973
00:42:52.328 --> 00:42:53.930
I can't believe we're
talking like this.


974
00:42:53.997 --> 00:42:56.332
Dick...

975
00:42:56.399 --> 00:42:57.666
we've always done things
the straight way.


976
00:42:57.733 --> 00:42:59.102
Yeah, well,

977
00:42:59.168 --> 00:43:01.004
I'm tired of belonging
to a minority group.


978
00:43:03.672 --> 00:43:04.573
Okay.

979
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:08.244
Okay, I'm going
to keep it.


980
00:43:08.311 --> 00:43:09.212
Good.

981
00:43:09.278 --> 00:43:10.846
I'm going to keep it.

982
00:43:10.914 --> 00:43:12.515
That's still good.

983
00:43:14.383 --> 00:43:15.919
Hey, do you think
it would be awful


984
00:43:15.985 --> 00:43:17.386
if we had a
little celebration?


985
00:43:17.453 --> 00:43:20.123
You mean eat something
besides Hamburger Helper?


986
00:43:20.189 --> 00:43:22.158
Mm-hm. A little red wine.

987
00:43:22.225 --> 00:43:25.094
How about
a little champagne?


988
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:29.498
Love you.

989
00:43:29.565 --> 00:43:31.400
I love you.

990
00:43:35.004 --> 00:43:36.906
Oh, my God, the lights.

991
00:43:36.973 --> 00:43:38.707
We got our lights back.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!


992
00:43:38.774 --> 00:43:40.977
I propose a toast.

993
00:43:41.044 --> 00:43:41.978
Down with candles.

994
00:43:42.045 --> 00:43:43.312
Down with
imitation mayonnaise.


995
00:43:43.379 --> 00:43:44.914
Down with
Hamburger Helper.


996
00:43:44.981 --> 00:43:46.582
Up the Harpers. Mmm.

997
00:43:46.649 --> 00:43:48.884
Here's looking
at you, Spot.


998
00:43:48.952 --> 00:43:50.119
Wow.

999
00:43:51.454 --> 00:43:53.022
Will you get that, honey?

1000
00:43:53.089 --> 00:43:54.290
Sure.

1001
00:43:55.691 --> 00:43:57.093
Yes?

1002
00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.528
Is this the residence
of Mr. Richard Harper?


1003
00:44:04.533 --> 00:44:06.869
Yes, I'm Mrs. Harper.

1004
00:44:06.936 --> 00:44:10.706
You've applied for
the food stamp program?


1005
00:44:10.773 --> 00:44:11.975
That's right.

1006
00:44:12.041 --> 00:44:13.342
My name is Johnson.

1007
00:44:13.409 --> 00:44:15.979
I'm the Income
Maintenance Technician.


1008
00:44:16.045 --> 00:44:17.380
The what?

1009
00:44:17.446 --> 00:44:20.616
I've come for
the inspection.


1010
00:44:22.185 --> 00:44:23.519
Uh...tonight?

1011
00:44:23.586 --> 00:44:25.288
Do you want to see
my credentials, lady?


1012
00:44:25.354 --> 00:44:28.257
No. No.

1013
00:44:29.792 --> 00:44:31.694
Please come in.

1014
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:41.404
* Bump dah dah dee
Dum dah dah *


1015
00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:42.638
Tah-dah!

1016
00:44:42.705 --> 00:44:43.973
Darling,
this is Mr. Johnson...


1017
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.474
the Income Maintenance
Mechanic.


1018
00:44:45.541 --> 00:44:47.343
Technician.

1019
00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:49.445
The food stamps
fellow.


1020
00:44:49.512 --> 00:44:54.417
Oh. Ooh. Ah.

1021
00:45:00.823 --> 00:45:02.225
Have you eaten,
Mr. Johnson?


1022
00:45:02.291 --> 00:45:04.760
Yes, I had a Big Mac
and a small fries.


1023
00:45:06.729 --> 00:45:08.731
You don't understand...

1024
00:45:08.797 --> 00:45:11.067
Don't I?

1025
00:45:11.134 --> 00:45:12.601
Would you like
some champagne?


1026
00:45:12.668 --> 00:45:14.837
And I also had a Coke.

1027
00:45:17.406 --> 00:45:18.641
The truth is that

1028
00:45:18.707 --> 00:45:20.043
we just ripped off
a loan company,


1029
00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:21.644
and this is the last
of our proceeds.


1030
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:24.747
I see, yes.

1031
00:45:24.813 --> 00:45:26.782
You want to see if we have
any cooking facilities,


1032
00:45:26.849 --> 00:45:28.051
right?

1033
00:45:28.117 --> 00:45:30.886
Yes, yes, that's
the first thing.


1034
00:45:30.953 --> 00:45:33.422
This way.

1035
00:45:39.728 --> 00:45:42.098
You don't have any assets
other than what's here?


1036
00:45:42.165 --> 00:45:43.299
That's it.

1037
00:45:43.366 --> 00:45:48.671
You sure messed up
real good.


1038
00:45:48.737 --> 00:45:49.972
We sure did.

1039
00:45:50.039 --> 00:45:54.543
Never mind the editorials.
Are we eligible or not?


1040
00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:56.979
According to the rules,
you're eligible.


1041
00:45:57.046 --> 00:45:58.381
Thank you.

1042
00:45:58.447 --> 00:45:59.882
Now, don't thank me.
It's people like you


1043
00:45:59.948 --> 00:46:01.917
who give this program
a bad name,


1044
00:46:01.984 --> 00:46:04.787
screw it up for others
who really need it.


1045
00:46:04.853 --> 00:46:06.422
I don't think that's fair.

1046
00:46:06.489 --> 00:46:08.091
Oh, Jane, the old rich

1047
00:46:08.157 --> 00:46:10.259
are always sticking it
to the new rich.


1048
00:46:10.326 --> 00:46:12.495
I guess the old poor have to
stick it to the nouveau poor.


1049
00:46:12.561 --> 00:46:14.563
We, in this case,
are the nouveau poor.


1050
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:16.031
Besides,
we really need it.


1051
00:46:16.099 --> 00:46:17.733
No one living in this house
or in this neighborhood


1052
00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:18.867
really needs it.

1053
00:46:18.934 --> 00:46:20.035
Oh, really?

1054
00:46:20.103 --> 00:46:21.304
You think we should
sell this house


1055
00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:22.671
and move to a slum
where we belong?


1056
00:46:22.738 --> 00:46:23.939
We should
sell the house


1057
00:46:24.006 --> 00:46:25.241
before the bank
sells it for us,


1058
00:46:25.308 --> 00:46:26.209
which is going to be
next week.


1059
00:46:26.275 --> 00:46:27.243
You can
just forget it,


1060
00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:28.677
because we're
keeping this house.


1061
00:46:28.744 --> 00:46:29.778
And how are we going
to make the payments?


1062
00:46:29.845 --> 00:46:31.247
We'll make the payments.

1063
00:46:31.314 --> 00:46:32.715
With what are we going
to make the payments?


1064
00:46:32.781 --> 00:46:34.283
You have accepted
our current problems


1065
00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:35.851
as permanent.
They are not.


1066
00:46:35.918 --> 00:46:37.120
This is only
a temporary condition.


1067
00:46:37.186 --> 00:46:38.487
You still haven't told me

1068
00:46:38.554 --> 00:46:39.555
how we're going to make
the payments.


1069
00:46:39.622 --> 00:46:41.324
The middle class

1070
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:42.891
is the backbone
of this country.


1071
00:46:42.958 --> 00:46:44.160
We've got to survive.

1072
00:46:44.227 --> 00:46:45.294
If we go under,

1073
00:46:45.361 --> 00:46:46.629
the whole country
can go under,


1074
00:46:46.695 --> 00:46:48.597
and in these, our
bicentennial years,


1075
00:46:48.664 --> 00:46:50.799
my contribution
is not going to be


1076
00:46:50.866 --> 00:46:53.536
the destruction
of the American middle class.


1077
00:46:53.602 --> 00:46:55.371
I don't know
what you're...


1078
00:46:55.438 --> 00:46:57.173
Billy, would you entertain
our guest, please?


1079
00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.507
Are you telling me

1080
00:46:58.574 --> 00:46:59.842
that we have nothing
to worry about?


1081
00:46:59.908 --> 00:47:01.043
You have nothing
to worry about.


1082
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:02.545
I'll speak to the bank
manager tomorrow.


1083
00:47:02.611 --> 00:47:04.347
I spoke to them today,
and he said, "Madam,


1084
00:47:04.413 --> 00:47:06.382
"you are no longer
banking with us,


1085
00:47:06.449 --> 00:47:07.383
we're banking with you."

1086
00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:08.917
Oh-ho. Very funny.

1087
00:47:08.984 --> 00:47:10.719
Will you leave it to me?
We'll make the payment.


1088
00:47:10.786 --> 00:47:11.787
With what?

1089
00:47:11.854 --> 00:47:13.322
We'll make the payment.

1090
00:47:26.001 --> 00:47:29.772
This is a stickup.
Stick 'em up.


1091
00:47:29.838 --> 00:47:30.973
Stick 'em up.

1092
00:47:31.039 --> 00:47:35.178
Stick 'em up.
Stick 'em up.


1093
00:47:40.449 --> 00:47:41.717
This is a stickup.

1094
00:47:41.784 --> 00:47:47.823
Stick 'em up.

1095
00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:50.025
Ow!

1096
00:47:50.092 --> 00:47:51.660
Are you kidding?

1097
00:47:53.196 --> 00:47:54.830
God, are you crazy?

1098
00:47:54.897 --> 00:47:57.733
Don't come in this room
when I have a gun in my hand.


1099
00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.268
You'll get
your goddamn head blown off.


1100
00:47:59.335 --> 00:48:01.069
Will you take that ridiculous
thing off your face?


1101
00:48:01.136 --> 00:48:03.539
I can't hear
a word you're saying.


1102
00:48:03.606 --> 00:48:05.341
Never sneak up on
a man holding a gun.


1103
00:48:05.408 --> 00:48:06.575
You can get killed.

1104
00:48:06.642 --> 00:48:07.776
What are you doing
with a gun?


1105
00:48:07.843 --> 00:48:09.245
Never mind.

1106
00:48:09.312 --> 00:48:10.646
I know what you're going
to do with the gun.


1107
00:48:10.713 --> 00:48:12.981
Yeah, well, you're
right about that,


1108
00:48:13.048 --> 00:48:14.383
and now, as long
as you're here,


1109
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:16.185
you can give me
the keys to the car.


1110
00:48:16.252 --> 00:48:17.786
Don't you think this
has gone far enough?


1111
00:48:17.853 --> 00:48:19.255
You're not going
to stop me.


1112
00:48:19.322 --> 00:48:21.690
I'm going to get
that money.


1113
00:48:21.757 --> 00:48:23.326
Do you think getting
arrested


1114
00:48:23.392 --> 00:48:25.494
is going to help us
get the money?


1115
00:48:25.561 --> 00:48:27.563
You don't think
I can do it, do you?


1116
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:30.065
I'm a washout.
I'm a loser.


1117
00:48:30.132 --> 00:48:33.936
Not even capable of holding up
a goddamn grocery store.


1118
00:48:34.002 --> 00:48:37.072
Any idiot can hold up
a grocery store.


1119
00:48:37.139 --> 00:48:38.907
Thank you.

1120
00:48:45.814 --> 00:48:47.383
You're really determined
to do this, aren't you?


1121
00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:48.951
That's right.

1122
00:48:49.017 --> 00:48:50.419
Is that what you're
going to wear?


1123
00:48:50.486 --> 00:48:51.954
Yeah.
What do you think?


1124
00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:53.756
I think you look like
the Easter Bunny Bandit.


1125
00:48:53.822 --> 00:48:55.057
I had to ask.

1126
00:48:55.123 --> 00:48:56.859
I mean, you might as well
wear a sign


1127
00:48:56.925 --> 00:48:58.327
that says "arrest me."

1128
00:48:58.394 --> 00:49:00.329
Okay, smart-ass,
what do you think I should wear?


1129
00:49:00.396 --> 00:49:01.697
Well, why don't you
wear something


1130
00:49:01.764 --> 00:49:03.031
a little more inconspicuous,

1131
00:49:03.098 --> 00:49:05.668
like, say, uh...
the Batman costume.


1132
00:49:19.014 --> 00:49:20.148
How's this?

1133
00:49:20.215 --> 00:49:21.350
It's fine.

1134
00:49:21.417 --> 00:49:23.185
Okay, baby, I'm off.

1135
00:49:23.252 --> 00:49:25.220
Uh, Dick?
Yeah?


1136
00:49:25.288 --> 00:49:28.357
Don't you think we've
forgotten something?


1137
00:49:28.424 --> 00:49:30.726
Oh, the iron, right.

1138
00:49:41.404 --> 00:49:42.471
Dick, don't you think

1139
00:49:42.538 --> 00:49:43.406
that gun is going
to attract


1140
00:49:43.472 --> 00:49:44.740
a little attention

1141
00:49:44.807 --> 00:49:46.041
sticking out of your
belt like that?


1142
00:49:46.108 --> 00:49:47.009
I was going
to wear a jacket.


1143
00:49:47.075 --> 00:49:48.344
Don't worry.

1144
00:49:48.411 --> 00:49:50.212
I have to worry.
I was a psych major.


1145
00:49:50.279 --> 00:49:51.380
You know what Freud said.

1146
00:49:51.447 --> 00:49:52.415
Criminals, they leave clues.

1147
00:49:52.481 --> 00:49:55.017
They have a compulsion
to confess.


1148
00:49:55.083 --> 00:49:56.952
I have a compulsion
to pay the mortgage.


1149
00:49:57.019 --> 00:49:58.587
Did Freud
ever write about that?


1150
00:49:58.654 --> 00:50:02.925
No, so there,
that takes care of Freud.


1151
00:50:05.694 --> 00:50:06.795
Hello, Mr. Harper.

1152
00:50:06.862 --> 00:50:08.230
Hello, Carol.

1153
00:50:08.297 --> 00:50:10.098
Jane, what is Carol
doing here?


1154
00:50:10.165 --> 00:50:11.867
Carol's here
because I'm going with you


1155
00:50:11.934 --> 00:50:13.336
to your business meeting
tonight.


1156
00:50:13.402 --> 00:50:14.637
You are not.
You're staying here.


1157
00:50:14.703 --> 00:50:15.671
I'm going alone.

1158
00:50:15.738 --> 00:50:17.606
Oh, on the contrary,
darling...


1159
00:50:17.673 --> 00:50:19.575
I wouldn't want to miss
one of your business meetings


1160
00:50:19.642 --> 00:50:20.843
for anything in the world.

1161
00:50:20.909 --> 00:50:22.478
You never know
what might happen.


1162
00:50:22.545 --> 00:50:23.912
Sweetie, don't forget
to go to bed at 9:30, okay?


1163
00:50:23.979 --> 00:50:25.314
Don't worry, Mrs. Harper.

1164
00:50:25.381 --> 00:50:26.715
On your feet, Carol,
I'm taking you home.


1165
00:50:26.782 --> 00:50:28.351
Sit down, Carol.
On your feet, Carol.


1166
00:50:28.417 --> 00:50:29.918
Sit down.
Carol...


1167
00:50:29.985 --> 00:50:31.887
Stay.
Okay, stay.


1168
00:50:31.954 --> 00:50:32.988
Both of you.
All of you.


1169
00:50:33.055 --> 00:50:34.590
Good night.
Have a good time.


1170
00:50:36.525 --> 00:50:37.893
Billy!

1171
00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.695
Billy, you know
what the vet said


1172
00:50:39.762 --> 00:50:42.631
about Spot sitting so close
to the television set.


1173
00:50:59.247 --> 00:51:03.386
All right, Jane,
you can come...


1174
00:51:03.452 --> 00:51:06.655
as long as you promise to do
exactly what I tell you.


1175
00:51:06.722 --> 00:51:07.990
I promise.

1176
00:51:08.056 --> 00:51:10.325
You drive.

1177
00:51:23.606 --> 00:51:24.707
What happened?

1178
00:51:24.773 --> 00:51:26.542
I think
I ruptured myself.


1179
00:51:27.943 --> 00:51:29.211
You realize if
that thing goes off,


1180
00:51:29.277 --> 00:51:30.813
you're going to be
going on this robbery


1181
00:51:30.879 --> 00:51:32.014
half-cocked, don't you?

1182
00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:32.915
Ho, ho, ho, ho,
very funny.


1183
00:51:32.981 --> 00:51:34.983
Just drive, damnit!

1184
00:51:42.024 --> 00:51:43.559
How did you happen
to pick Monrovia?


1185
00:51:43.626 --> 00:51:45.828
I wanted an area far
enough away from us.


1186
00:51:45.894 --> 00:51:46.829
Any objections?

1187
00:51:46.895 --> 00:51:48.130
Oh, no.

1188
00:51:48.196 --> 00:51:49.765
I can't believe it.

1189
00:51:49.832 --> 00:51:51.767
I am curious about
one thing though.


1190
00:51:51.834 --> 00:51:53.436
I knew it.

1191
00:51:53.502 --> 00:51:55.671
How were you planning to get
to the scene of the crime


1192
00:51:55.738 --> 00:51:56.772
if I hadn't come home?

1193
00:51:56.839 --> 00:51:57.973
Cab?

1194
00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:01.777
I was going
to steal a car.


1195
00:52:03.111 --> 00:52:06.181
Oh, Dick, that I would
like to see.


1196
00:52:06.248 --> 00:52:08.016
Yeah, well,
we'll be using


1197
00:52:08.083 --> 00:52:09.418
what is known
as the two-car method.


1198
00:52:09.485 --> 00:52:10.453
Really?

1199
00:52:10.519 --> 00:52:12.154
You park your regular car,

1200
00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.756
steal a car
for the actual robbery,


1201
00:52:13.822 --> 00:52:15.624
returning later to pick
up your regular car.


1202
00:52:15.691 --> 00:52:20.295
Dick...Richard...
you can't steal a car.


1203
00:52:20.362 --> 00:52:22.931
Put a man on the moon,
I think I can steal a car.


1204
00:52:30.405 --> 00:52:31.807
Will you stop
that whistling?


1205
00:52:41.817 --> 00:52:43.351
There's something wrong
with this car.


1206
00:52:43.418 --> 00:52:44.487
It just won't start.

1207
00:52:44.553 --> 00:52:46.221
Why don't you kick it?

1208
00:52:46.288 --> 00:52:49.424
That's right, Jane...
just keep riding me.


1209
00:52:49.492 --> 00:52:50.726
That's a big help.

1210
00:52:50.793 --> 00:52:54.062
If I could just find
an old Hudson,


1211
00:52:54.129 --> 00:52:55.263
there wouldn't be
any problem.


1212
00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:56.331
Why don't you try
this car?


1213
00:52:56.398 --> 00:52:57.633
What?

1214
00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:59.134
Why don't you give
this one a shot?


1215
00:52:59.201 --> 00:53:00.636
I don't know anything
about foreign cars.


1216
00:53:00.703 --> 00:53:03.071
Oh, I think you can
handle this one, Dick.


1217
00:53:03.138 --> 00:53:04.640
The keys are in it.

1218
00:53:08.877 --> 00:53:09.912
You...

1219
00:53:22.525 --> 00:53:24.593
"D" is for "drive," dear.

1220
00:53:36.572 --> 00:53:38.607
What do you think?

1221
00:53:38.674 --> 00:53:40.308
It's too big,
it's too bright,


1222
00:53:40.375 --> 00:53:41.510
it's crowded.

1223
00:53:41.577 --> 00:53:42.778
It's ridiculous.

1224
00:53:42.845 --> 00:53:44.246
What are
all these people doing,


1225
00:53:44.312 --> 00:53:45.514
out shopping
in the middle of the night?


1226
00:53:45.581 --> 00:53:48.584
They ought
to be home in bed.


1227
00:54:11.006 --> 00:54:12.875
Okay, this is it, as they say.

1228
00:54:12.941 --> 00:54:14.843
No, Dick. Let's go home
before it's too late.


1229
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:16.044
Goddamn it, Jane...

1230
00:54:16.111 --> 00:54:17.245
We're not cut out
for this.


1231
00:54:17.312 --> 00:54:19.247
I told you I was going
to, and I mean it.


1232
00:54:19.314 --> 00:54:20.916
Oh, sweetie,
we'll get the money.


1233
00:54:20.983 --> 00:54:22.184
It's not the money.

1234
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:23.786
It's the principle
of the thing.


1235
00:54:23.852 --> 00:54:25.153
Principle?

1236
00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:26.454
What principle
in robbing a drugstore?


1237
00:54:26.521 --> 00:54:29.057
It's the money.
That's the principle.


1238
00:54:29.124 --> 00:54:30.693
That's the principle
of the thing.


1239
00:54:30.759 --> 00:54:32.160
Uh-uh-uh...

1240
00:54:32.227 --> 00:54:33.862
You wouldn't understand.
Now don't interfere.


1241
00:54:34.997 --> 00:54:36.932
You stay right here.

1242
00:54:36.999 --> 00:54:38.233
I'm going in alone,

1243
00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:42.037
and I don't want
any crap about it.


1244
00:54:55.450 --> 00:54:57.319
Kind of a light door.

1245
00:55:14.002 --> 00:55:15.537
Yes?

1246
00:55:17.139 --> 00:55:19.541
Yes, uh...

1247
00:55:22.210 --> 00:55:23.545
Uh...

1248
00:55:23.612 --> 00:55:24.747
May I help you, sir?

1249
00:55:24.813 --> 00:55:25.948
May you help me?

1250
00:55:26.014 --> 00:55:27.082
Uh, yeah.

1251
00:55:27.149 --> 00:55:29.885
Uh...

1252
00:55:35.157 --> 00:55:36.491
Don't you worry, son.

1253
00:55:36.558 --> 00:55:38.193
I think I've got
what you're looking for.


1254
00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:39.461
Yeah.

1255
00:55:39.527 --> 00:55:41.797
Now, here they are,
right here.


1256
00:55:41.864 --> 00:55:44.833
Some of these
are lubricated.


1257
00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:48.837
Now, this isn't lubricated,
but it's a good one.


1258
00:55:48.904 --> 00:55:53.642
And some of these
are contoured for better fit.


1259
00:55:53.709 --> 00:55:55.377
We've got them
in different colors.


1260
00:55:55.443 --> 00:55:59.748
We've got cherry red,
and we've got midnight blue...


1261
00:55:59.815 --> 00:56:01.984
And we've got the rainbow.

1262
00:56:02.050 --> 00:56:03.719
I'll take them all.

1263
00:56:03.786 --> 00:56:05.087
All?

1264
00:56:05.153 --> 00:56:05.954
Yeah. Yeah.

1265
00:56:06.021 --> 00:56:07.455
And wrap them up.

1266
00:56:07.522 --> 00:56:08.757
Uh...

1267
00:56:08.824 --> 00:56:10.158
that'll be...

1268
00:56:10.225 --> 00:56:12.060
uh, $8.50.

1269
00:56:12.127 --> 00:56:14.062
I wish I was
as young as you are.


1270
00:56:14.129 --> 00:56:15.397
You don't understand.

1271
00:56:15.463 --> 00:56:17.165
What do you mean
I don't understand?


1272
00:56:17.232 --> 00:56:18.834
I'm not that old.

1273
00:56:18.901 --> 00:56:20.435
There you are.

1274
00:56:38.253 --> 00:56:40.522
Now can we go home?

1275
00:56:40.588 --> 00:56:44.392
I came out here to do something
and I'm going to do it.


1276
00:56:49.865 --> 00:56:51.133
Well, this evening

1277
00:56:51.199 --> 00:56:52.367
could turn out to be
quite expensive,


1278
00:56:52.434 --> 00:56:53.802
what with gas and...

1279
00:56:53.869 --> 00:56:56.538
sundry items.

1280
00:57:29.805 --> 00:57:31.473
Did you ever hear
of a delicatessen


1281
00:57:31.539 --> 00:57:33.742
that wouldn't take
cash after 10:00?


1282
00:57:33.809 --> 00:57:35.643
Not a nickel
in the register.


1283
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:37.412
You got somebody
to open the register?


1284
00:57:37.479 --> 00:57:39.081
That's right, Jane.

1285
00:57:39.147 --> 00:57:41.416
Was she very old
or just crippled and blind?


1286
00:57:41.483 --> 00:57:42.417
For your information,

1287
00:57:42.484 --> 00:57:44.586
she was quite able...

1288
00:57:44.652 --> 00:57:46.554
Ah.

1289
00:58:06.308 --> 00:58:08.977
Nobody move.
This is a stickup.


1290
00:58:16.551 --> 00:58:18.821
Just hold it right there.
Nobody move.


1291
00:58:40.976 --> 00:58:42.210
When did they start

1292
00:58:42.277 --> 00:58:44.646
bussing white robbers into
the black neighborhoods?


1293
00:58:48.917 --> 00:58:50.018
What happened?

1294
00:58:50.085 --> 00:58:51.753
No bullets.
Thanks a lot.


1295
00:58:52.888 --> 00:58:54.857
You had to talk me into
carrying an empty gun,


1296
00:58:54.923 --> 00:58:55.924
my own wife.

1297
00:58:55.991 --> 00:58:57.225
I could have gotten
killed in there.


1298
00:58:57.292 --> 00:58:58.093
Oh, please, tell me
what happened.


1299
00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:59.394
Nothing happened.

1300
00:58:59.461 --> 00:59:01.997
Except I almost got
killed thanks to you.


1301
00:59:02.064 --> 00:59:04.432
I knew I shouldn't
have brought you.


1302
00:59:04.499 --> 00:59:06.501
You would have been busted
in the parking lot


1303
00:59:06.568 --> 00:59:07.635
if you hadn't
brought me along.


1304
00:59:07.702 --> 00:59:09.171
How can anybody do anything

1305
00:59:09.237 --> 00:59:10.805
with this kind
of defeatist talk?


1306
00:59:10.873 --> 00:59:13.141
Okay.

1307
00:59:13.208 --> 00:59:14.809
Maybe there's an orphanage
around here.


1308
00:59:14.877 --> 00:59:15.777
They usually deal in cash...

1309
00:59:15.844 --> 00:59:18.113
Just shut up, Jane.

1310
00:59:41.436 --> 00:59:43.071
What do you think
you're doing?


1311
00:59:43.138 --> 00:59:45.473
Sitting in a stolen car
makes me nervous.


1312
00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:46.841
I'm going with you
where it's safe.


1313
00:59:46.909 --> 00:59:48.076
Get back in the car.
No.


1314
00:59:48.143 --> 00:59:50.178
I said, get back
in the car.


1315
00:59:50.245 --> 00:59:51.846
Right, you said
get back in the car,


1316
00:59:51.914 --> 00:59:53.448
and then I said "no."

1317
00:59:53.515 --> 00:59:54.816
I'm going in there,

1318
00:59:54.883 --> 00:59:58.053
and you'd better
stay right here.


1319
01:00:03.091 --> 01:00:05.093
Do you have to louse
everything up?


1320
01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.261
You messed up
this whole evening.


1321
01:00:06.328 --> 01:00:07.462
First, it was
the pantyhose,


1322
01:00:07.529 --> 01:00:08.630
then you insisted...

1323
01:00:08.696 --> 01:00:09.497
You still
want pantyhose?


1324
01:00:09.564 --> 01:00:10.598
You want pantyhose?

1325
01:00:10.665 --> 01:00:12.000
Will you put your
pants on,


1326
01:00:12.067 --> 01:00:13.335
for God's sake?

1327
01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:15.670
This is a respectable
X-rated motel.


1328
01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:16.972
I'm warning you.

1329
01:00:17.039 --> 01:00:18.907
That bitch,
I could kill her.


1330
01:00:18.974 --> 01:00:20.108
Whatever turns
you on, man,


1331
01:00:20.175 --> 01:00:21.476
but you pay for
anything you break.


1332
01:00:21.543 --> 01:00:22.644
I don't want any shit,

1333
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:23.678
or I'll blow
your head off.


1334
01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:25.213
Take whatever you want.

1335
01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.848
Turn around and put your
hands against the wall.


1336
01:00:26.915 --> 01:00:30.785
Just cool it with that gun,
okay?


1337
01:00:30.852 --> 01:00:31.886
Oh, Jesus!

1338
01:00:31.954 --> 01:00:33.155
Oh, my God!

1339
01:00:33.221 --> 01:00:34.822
I forgot
to go to the bank today.


1340
01:00:34.889 --> 01:00:36.191
Harley's going to kill me.
He's going to skin my ass.


1341
01:00:36.258 --> 01:00:37.359
You got something
to put this in?


1342
01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:38.460
There's a box
on the top shelf.


1343
01:00:38.526 --> 01:00:39.827
Who's Harley?

1344
01:00:39.894 --> 01:00:41.463
The owner.
A mean mother.


1345
01:00:41.529 --> 01:00:42.897
Is he really going
to hurt you?


1346
01:00:44.132 --> 01:00:45.700
Oh, Dick,
he's really going to hurt him.


1347
01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:46.768
Maybe we shouldn't take it.

1348
01:00:46.834 --> 01:00:48.636
What, are you crazy?

1349
01:00:48.703 --> 01:00:50.038
You stay right there...

1350
01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:51.206
don't move,
don't take a leak, nothing.


1351
01:00:51.273 --> 01:00:52.307
I'm sorry.

1352
01:00:52.374 --> 01:00:53.408
Come on, will you?

1353
01:01:00.615 --> 01:01:02.550
Goodbye.

1354
01:01:21.469 --> 01:01:24.106
They're going to call us
the "Bickering Bandits."


1355
01:01:24.172 --> 01:01:25.073
That'll be our M.O.

1356
01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:26.208
Right.
Sure.


1357
01:01:26.274 --> 01:01:27.875
Right. What?

1358
01:01:27.942 --> 01:01:29.944
M.O.
That's Modus Operandi.


1359
01:01:30.012 --> 01:01:31.313
That's the method
of operation, you know?


1360
01:01:31.379 --> 01:01:33.015
Now, wait a minute, Dick.

1361
01:01:33.081 --> 01:01:34.082
We're not having
any modus operandi.


1362
01:01:34.149 --> 01:01:35.083
No modus operandi?

1363
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:36.351
Tonight was it, right?

1364
01:01:36.418 --> 01:01:37.619
Halloween comes
but once a year.


1365
01:01:37.685 --> 01:01:38.753
Oh, sure.

1366
01:01:42.457 --> 01:01:43.758
Take that one.

1367
01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:46.261
What...what is it?

1368
01:01:46.328 --> 01:01:47.362
No. That was too casual.

1369
01:01:47.429 --> 01:01:48.296
What was too casual?

1370
01:01:48.363 --> 01:01:49.497
You've got
to promise me.


1371
01:01:49.564 --> 01:01:50.632
Mm.

1372
01:01:50.698 --> 01:01:51.733
You promise me?

1373
01:01:51.799 --> 01:01:53.201
Mm, what?
Promise you?


1374
01:01:53.268 --> 01:01:54.102
Boy, do I promise you.

1375
01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:55.003
You promise?

1376
01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:56.404
Completely.
Okay.


1377
01:03:11.313 --> 01:03:12.614
Hi.
Hi.


1378
01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.116
Can I help you, sir?

1379
01:03:14.182 --> 01:03:15.117
There's something the
matter with this record.


1380
01:03:15.183 --> 01:03:16.484
Oh, what's that?

1381
01:03:16.551 --> 01:03:17.785
There's a gun in it.
This is a holdup.


1382
01:03:17.852 --> 01:03:19.087
Now, do exactly
as I tell you,


1383
01:03:19.154 --> 01:03:20.088
and no one
will get hurt.


1384
01:03:20.155 --> 01:03:21.156
Sounds fair to me.

1385
01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:24.726
Just keep looking at me
and smiling and nodding.


1386
01:03:24.792 --> 01:03:25.760
Do you have any
Bessie Smith records?


1387
01:03:25.827 --> 01:03:27.162
Uh...uh...
Bessie Smith?


1388
01:03:27.229 --> 01:03:28.396
Yeah, she's
an old blues singer.


1389
01:03:28.463 --> 01:03:31.333
Oh, uh...yes, sir, yes, sir.
I believe we do, sir.


1390
01:03:31.399 --> 01:03:32.467
Do you like
that old jazz?


1391
01:03:32.534 --> 01:03:33.401
Well I...I...I...

1392
01:03:33.468 --> 01:03:34.402
I like the more modern...

1393
01:03:34.469 --> 01:03:35.337
uh...kind of stuff.

1394
01:03:35.403 --> 01:03:36.538
You know,
progressive...


1395
01:03:36.604 --> 01:03:37.572
uh...
Mm...mm...iles, and...


1396
01:03:37.639 --> 01:03:39.040
you know, a few
people like this...


1397
01:03:39.107 --> 01:03:40.475
Sedaka, he's good.

1398
01:03:40.542 --> 01:03:43.077
The lady will be leaving
in just a moment,


1399
01:03:43.145 --> 01:03:44.246
and you'll say to her

1400
01:03:44.312 --> 01:03:45.413
"Thank you very much,
Mrs. Jones."


1401
01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.715
Thank you very much,
Mrs. Jones. Okay.


1402
01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:48.750
A nice smile.

1403
01:03:48.816 --> 01:03:50.017
Go. Go.

1404
01:03:50.084 --> 01:03:51.986
Thank you very much,
Mrs. Jones.


1405
01:03:52.053 --> 01:03:52.987
Think nothing of it.

1406
01:03:53.054 --> 01:03:53.988
That was very nice.

1407
01:03:54.055 --> 01:03:55.657
I liked the smile.

1408
01:03:55.723 --> 01:03:57.259
Uh, I'll be leaving now.

1409
01:03:57.325 --> 01:04:00.027
And you say, "I'll try and get
the Bessie Smith record for you


1410
01:04:00.094 --> 01:04:02.096
next week, Mr. Jones."

1411
01:04:02.164 --> 01:04:04.031
Now!

1412
01:04:04.098 --> 01:04:06.134
Well, I'll I'll try and get
the Bessie Jones record


1413
01:04:06.201 --> 01:04:07.502
for you next week,
Mr. Smith.


1414
01:04:07.569 --> 01:04:09.271
Thank you.

1415
01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:13.908
Oh, yeah. $4.98...
uh, tax and license.


1416
01:04:21.749 --> 01:04:24.719
How was the food?

1417
01:04:24.786 --> 01:04:26.421
That bad, huh?

1418
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:29.457
Oh, baby!

1419
01:04:29.524 --> 01:04:31.259
Oh, baby.

1420
01:04:42.637 --> 01:04:45.373
Oh. God.

1421
01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:47.942
Dick, I'm ruined
for life.


1422
01:04:48.843 --> 01:04:50.111
I want to know the name

1423
01:04:50.178 --> 01:04:51.379
of the pervert
who shot off my phone.


1424
01:04:51.446 --> 01:04:53.080
In spite of
what you think,


1425
01:04:53.147 --> 01:04:55.550
we do not get our kicks
cutting off telephones.


1426
01:04:55.617 --> 01:04:57.652
I tell you,
I never got a bill.


1427
01:04:57.719 --> 01:04:58.986
Excuse me,
I'm sorry.


1428
01:04:59.053 --> 01:05:00.322
Who do you think you are?

1429
01:05:00.388 --> 01:05:02.457
You'll have to wait in line
like everyone else.


1430
01:05:02.524 --> 01:05:03.991
I'm sorry, excuse me,

1431
01:05:04.058 --> 01:05:05.327
but I'm afraid this is
what they call a stickup.


1432
01:05:05.393 --> 01:05:06.228
Hey,
they're holding up


1433
01:05:06.294 --> 01:05:07.762
the telephone company!

1434
01:05:07.829 --> 01:05:09.664
Shoot out the computers
while you're at it.


1435
01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:14.602
God bless you.
Give them a hand.


1436
01:05:15.970 --> 01:05:18.072
Beautiful. Beautiful.

1437
01:05:31.052 --> 01:05:32.220
He's had
several offers,


1438
01:05:32.287 --> 01:05:33.755
but because of
his investments,


1439
01:05:33.821 --> 01:05:35.690
he doesn't have to
rush into anything.


1440
01:05:35.757 --> 01:05:37.325
He's looking for

1441
01:05:37.392 --> 01:05:39.994
a very dynamic situation in
a company like yours, Jason.


1442
01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:42.697
Are you familiar with
the film business?


1443
01:05:42.764 --> 01:05:44.165
Hey, how about
a drink, huh?


1444
01:05:44.232 --> 01:05:46.067
Come on.

1445
01:05:46.133 --> 01:05:47.969
Gracias...

1446
01:05:48.035 --> 01:05:48.903
amigo.

1447
01:05:48.970 --> 01:05:51.739
Oh, you're welcome.

1448
01:05:57.078 --> 01:05:58.246
Adios!

1449
01:05:58.313 --> 01:05:59.347
You've got to
go down there.


1450
01:05:59.414 --> 01:06:01.015
You really owe it
to yourself.


1451
01:06:01.082 --> 01:06:02.650
May I borrow my husband
for a moment?


1452
01:06:02.717 --> 01:06:04.151
Be my guest, Jane.

1453
01:06:04.218 --> 01:06:05.587
Dick...

1454
01:06:05.653 --> 01:06:07.289
Really, Jane,
I was making some progress.


1455
01:06:07.355 --> 01:06:09.491
That's
the condominium king.


1456
01:06:09.557 --> 01:06:12.093
You're an aerospace executive,
not a real estate salesman.


1457
01:06:12.159 --> 01:06:13.895
Right now I'm feeling
pretty flexible.


1458
01:06:24.272 --> 01:06:25.473
Oh, Raoul...

1459
01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:27.208
Oh, no, no,
that's okay.


1460
01:06:27.275 --> 01:06:29.243
Enjoy yourself.
Let me do it.


1461
01:06:29.311 --> 01:06:30.345
Mum's the word, eh, Raoul?

1462
01:06:37.184 --> 01:06:39.153
This is something else.

1463
01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:40.322
Did you find
buried treasure?


1464
01:06:40.388 --> 01:06:43.558
Living off my investments,
Nesbit.


1465
01:06:48.996 --> 01:06:51.933
Ah, Dick.
Put her there, pal.


1466
01:06:51.999 --> 01:06:53.301
Glad you could make it.

1467
01:06:53.368 --> 01:06:54.268
Hello, Mildred.

1468
01:06:54.336 --> 01:06:55.570
Ole, Ricardo.

1469
01:06:55.637 --> 01:06:57.739
Oh, we wouldn't have
missed this for the world.


1470
01:06:57.805 --> 01:06:59.140
I love your
small pool, Jane.


1471
01:06:59.206 --> 01:07:01.075
It's so cozy.

1472
01:07:01.142 --> 01:07:02.310
Oh, thank you, Mildred.

1473
01:07:02.377 --> 01:07:04.145
I see you landed
on your feet.


1474
01:07:04.211 --> 01:07:06.280
Actually, Charlie,
I landed on my ass,


1475
01:07:06.348 --> 01:07:08.082
and then when I fell
off of my ass,


1476
01:07:08.149 --> 01:07:09.884
I had no place to go
but my feet.


1477
01:07:09.951 --> 01:07:10.952
What line
are you in?


1478
01:07:11.018 --> 01:07:12.520
Robber.

1479
01:07:12.587 --> 01:07:13.821
As in tires and erasers.

1480
01:07:13.888 --> 01:07:17.091
Oh, that's
a good field.


1481
01:07:17.158 --> 01:07:18.793
Do you make it
or sell it?


1482
01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:20.695
Steal it.

1483
01:07:20.762 --> 01:07:23.097
Like stealing candy
from a baby.


1484
01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:24.466
He is so modest.

1485
01:07:24.532 --> 01:07:27.268
Steel...hey,
there's a solid industry.


1486
01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:28.803
I thought
he said rubber?


1487
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:30.772
Actually, Jane's
working now too.


1488
01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:31.939
What are
you doing?


1489
01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:33.875
Adios!

1490
01:07:33.941 --> 01:07:35.109
Investments.
Investments.


1491
01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:36.744
She's in charge
of salting it away.


1492
01:07:36.811 --> 01:07:38.880
Got the guts of a bandit.

1493
01:07:38.946 --> 01:07:39.981
Maybe
you could help me.


1494
01:07:40.047 --> 01:07:41.683
I have to go to Washington
next week,


1495
01:07:41.749 --> 01:07:43.651
but I'll give you, uh...

1496
01:07:43.718 --> 01:07:44.786
a little call when I get back.

1497
01:07:44.852 --> 01:07:47.689
That could be

1498
01:07:47.755 --> 01:07:51.125
I'm just going to talk
to a Congressional committee.


1499
01:07:51.192 --> 01:07:52.427
They think Charlie's

1500
01:07:52.494 --> 01:07:54.161
been paying off
some people besides them.


1501
01:07:54.228 --> 01:07:56.097
Larry Maguire!

1502
01:07:56.864 --> 01:07:58.265
That's not Larry.

1503
01:07:58.332 --> 01:07:59.166
Oh!
Taquito?


1504
01:07:59.233 --> 01:08:01.102
Thank you.

1505
01:08:01.168 --> 01:08:03.705
Bueno.

1506
01:08:06.608 --> 01:08:09.276
Oh, is it burning
you, Mildred?


1507
01:08:09.343 --> 01:08:10.745
Oh, that's too bad.

1508
01:08:10.812 --> 01:08:11.946
Would you like
some wine?


1509
01:08:12.013 --> 01:08:13.080
I'll get some water.

1510
01:08:13.147 --> 01:08:14.181
Tequila, please.

1511
01:08:14.248 --> 01:08:17.719
And now, once again,

1512
01:08:17.785 --> 01:08:20.622
bringing you
salvation and success,


1513
01:08:20.688 --> 01:08:22.857
righteousness and riches,

1514
01:08:22.924 --> 01:08:26.260
the Reverend Dr. Thomas Will.

1515
01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.836
You know, we've all
heard the expression,


1516
01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:36.704
"The meek
shall inherit the earth."


1517
01:08:36.771 --> 01:08:39.607
Well, that's exactly
what they're going to get.


1518
01:08:39.674 --> 01:08:41.576
Dirt.

1519
01:08:41.643 --> 01:08:43.778
We all have to learn
how to be positive.


1520
01:08:43.845 --> 01:08:46.681
You see, I...I don't want
you to say "amen."


1521
01:08:46.748 --> 01:08:48.950
I want you to say "I am."

1522
01:08:49.016 --> 01:08:50.452
I am!

1523
01:08:50.518 --> 01:08:54.188
You have to remember
that God is in you


1524
01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:56.924
and in you and in you
and in you and in me.


1525
01:08:56.991 --> 01:09:00.795
Now, if you open up your heart
and you let God inside,


1526
01:09:00.862 --> 01:09:02.196
he will make you rich.

1527
01:09:02.263 --> 01:09:03.931
I am!

1528
01:09:03.998 --> 01:09:09.737
Let me remind you
that the cross is a plus sign.


1529
01:09:09.804 --> 01:09:12.406
Now, I want you all
to repeat after me.


1530
01:09:12.474 --> 01:09:15.142
Money loves me.

1531
01:09:15.209 --> 01:09:19.947
Money loves to be
in my pocket.


1532
01:09:20.014 --> 01:09:23.350
I see a whole mountain
of money coming towards me.


1533
01:09:23.417 --> 01:09:24.486
I see a mountain
of money


1534
01:09:24.552 --> 01:09:25.920
coming towards me.

1535
01:09:25.987 --> 01:09:27.354
Now, I want you all

1536
01:09:27.421 --> 01:09:29.223
to donate generously
to the ministry today,


1537
01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:31.358
and remember
that every dollar you give,


1538
01:09:31.425 --> 01:09:33.427
God will pay you back tenfold

1539
01:09:33.495 --> 01:09:36.498
in some wondrous and
mysterious and exciting way...


1540
01:09:36.564 --> 01:09:38.766
a car, a boat,
a plane, a home.


1541
01:09:38.833 --> 01:09:41.503
Just one other
couple, Dr. Will.


1542
01:09:41.569 --> 01:09:43.738
Yea, I say unto you,
bring them in.


1543
01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:44.706
They're here to win.

1544
01:09:44.772 --> 01:09:45.673
Have a seat, young lady.

1545
01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:46.641
Inspirational sermon, doctor.

1546
01:09:46.708 --> 01:09:47.675
Thank you, thank you.

1547
01:09:47.742 --> 01:09:49.176
Yes, particularly
the part


1548
01:09:49.243 --> 01:09:51.045
about not feeling guilty
about prospering.


1549
01:09:51.112 --> 01:09:52.446
Ah-ha.

1550
01:09:52.514 --> 01:09:54.849
Well, you see, that is
called "say I am."


1551
01:09:54.916 --> 01:09:56.150
If you want more money,

1552
01:09:56.217 --> 01:09:59.453
you must get an expanded idea
of yourself.


1553
01:09:59.521 --> 01:10:02.156
You must think of yourself
as one who has more money.


1554
01:10:02.223 --> 01:10:05.693
We're trying, doctor.

1555
01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.328
Well, go ahead,
touch it, son.


1556
01:10:07.394 --> 01:10:09.497
Don't be afraid. Go on.

1557
01:10:09.564 --> 01:10:12.700
Go ahead, dear,
touch it.


1558
01:10:12.767 --> 01:10:16.871
Go on.

1559
01:10:16.938 --> 01:10:20.441
That's it,
touch it some more.


1560
01:10:20.508 --> 01:10:21.976
You see, you must
take the limit


1561
01:10:22.043 --> 01:10:23.444
off your
financial thinking,


1562
01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:25.613
and you will get more money.

1563
01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:26.614
Don't worry about how.

1564
01:10:26.681 --> 01:10:27.782
Inspirational.

1565
01:10:27.849 --> 01:10:29.316
Say "I am."

1566
01:10:29.383 --> 01:10:30.518
Stick 'em up.

1567
01:10:32.319 --> 01:10:33.888
Did I hear you right, sinner?

1568
01:10:33.955 --> 01:10:34.856
You holding me up?

1569
01:10:34.922 --> 01:10:36.490
I am.

1570
01:10:36.558 --> 01:10:39.193
Hands on your head,
both of you.


1571
01:10:41.395 --> 01:10:42.296
Move!

1572
01:10:42.363 --> 01:10:43.665
Will you get out of the way?

1573
01:10:43.731 --> 01:10:46.668
God wants you
out of the way.


1574
01:10:46.734 --> 01:10:48.936
Guards!

1575
01:11:02.584 --> 01:11:05.820
Stop them, for they
have sinned.


1576
01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:09.624
Would you mind getting
the hell off the car?


1577
01:11:09.691 --> 01:11:12.459
Testing. Testing.

1578
01:11:16.764 --> 01:11:18.465
Oh, Jesus!

1579
01:11:21.035 --> 01:11:21.903
Are you all right?

1580
01:11:21.969 --> 01:11:23.971
Yeah, I think so.

1581
01:11:30.311 --> 01:11:32.146
Pull over, you sinners.

1582
01:11:32.213 --> 01:11:33.915
They are thieves. Stop them.

1583
01:11:33.981 --> 01:11:37.418
They have stolen all my...
the Lord's money.


1584
01:11:37.484 --> 01:11:38.352
Oh, no!

1585
01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:39.921
Oh, God!

1586
01:11:39.987 --> 01:11:41.756
If you'll pull over
at the next traffic light,


1587
01:11:41.823 --> 01:11:43.057
God will forgive you.

1588
01:11:43.124 --> 01:11:43.991
He is no stool pigeon.

1589
01:11:44.058 --> 01:11:45.693
Oh, my God!

1590
01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.529
God does not hold a grudge.
Remember, thou shalt not steal.


1591
01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:50.765
They're coming closer to us,
Dick.


1592
01:11:50.832 --> 01:11:52.233
That is the fourth...

1593
01:11:52.299 --> 01:11:56.503
it's...that's one
of them Commandments.


1594
01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:59.240
Now, give me back
my goddamn money, will you?


1595
01:11:59.306 --> 01:12:01.108
Come on, step on it.

1596
01:12:01.175 --> 01:12:03.310
Can't you get some more juice
out of this goddamn thing?


1597
01:12:03.377 --> 01:12:05.813
Watch out! Jesus Christ!

1598
01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.849
You almost broke my ass,
you fool.


1599
01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:11.085
Oh, a cop!

1600
01:12:57.965 --> 01:13:00.534
That is my money!

1601
01:13:24.792 --> 01:13:26.260
How much did we get?

1602
01:13:26.327 --> 01:13:29.663
Not very much.
It's mostly ones.


1603
01:13:29.731 --> 01:13:32.767
Mostly ones?

1604
01:13:32.834 --> 01:13:34.668
Hey, where's
the other money?


1605
01:13:34.736 --> 01:13:36.804
What other money?

1606
01:13:36.871 --> 01:13:39.874
All the other money,
that's what other money.


1607
01:13:39.941 --> 01:13:41.776
In the shrubbery.

1608
01:13:41.843 --> 01:13:43.177
In the shrubbery?

1609
01:13:43.244 --> 01:13:46.147
In the pool.

1610
01:13:46.213 --> 01:13:47.715
In the swimming pool?

1611
01:13:47.782 --> 01:13:50.084
It's in the utilities,
it's in the car,


1612
01:13:50.151 --> 01:13:51.986
in the furniture,
it's in the mortgage,


1613
01:13:52.053 --> 01:13:53.620
it's in the insurance.

1614
01:13:53.687 --> 01:13:57.191
It's at
the Diner's Club...


1615
01:14:06.768 --> 01:14:09.070
Well, it's not worth it.

1616
01:14:09.136 --> 01:14:11.372
I'm not cut out
for blue-collar crime.


1617
01:14:11.438 --> 01:14:14.641
I have a white-collar mentality.
I panic in the face of death.


1618
01:14:21.248 --> 01:14:22.950
Maybe we should retire.

1619
01:14:29.523 --> 01:14:30.591
Are all our debts paid?

1620
01:14:30.657 --> 01:14:33.027
Yes.

1621
01:14:33.094 --> 01:14:35.396
Well, at least
we won't starve.


1622
01:14:35.462 --> 01:14:38.465
We've just been accepted
by the food stamp program.


1623
01:14:38.532 --> 01:14:40.034
Hurray.

1624
01:14:41.769 --> 01:14:43.337
Charlie?

1625
01:14:43.404 --> 01:14:44.906
Where?

1626
01:14:44.972 --> 01:14:46.373
Mr. Blanchard,

1627
01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.975
I would like you to
tell this committee


1628
01:14:48.042 --> 01:14:49.376
if you have ever

1629
01:14:49.443 --> 01:14:51.245
in your position
as President of Taft,


1630
01:14:51.312 --> 01:14:52.679
bribed anyone,
either here or abroad,


1631
01:14:52.746 --> 01:14:54.481
for the purpose

1632
01:14:54.548 --> 01:14:57.451
of consummating
a business deal.


1633
01:14:57.518 --> 01:15:01.856
Senator, no one
at Taft Aerospace,


1634
01:15:01.923 --> 01:15:06.760
to the best of my knowledge,
ever bribed anybody.


1635
01:15:06.828 --> 01:15:08.562
Ooh.

1636
01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:12.766
Maybe that's why
business is so bad.


1637
01:15:12.834 --> 01:15:15.102
Look at him.
Listen to him shovel it.


1638
01:15:15.169 --> 01:15:17.404
There's never been
a deal made at Taft


1639
01:15:17.471 --> 01:15:20.007
what with somebody didn't
get paid off somewhere.


1640
01:15:20.074 --> 01:15:21.843
We have already
elicited testimony


1641
01:15:21.909 --> 01:15:23.210
from other companies

1642
01:15:23.277 --> 01:15:25.746
involved in the same business
as yours,


1643
01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:28.015
and they claim that pay-offs
are an integral part


1644
01:15:28.082 --> 01:15:30.451
of their carrying on
their business.


1645
01:15:30.517 --> 01:15:33.787
Do you mean to tell me
that you are the exception?


1646
01:15:33.855 --> 01:15:35.689
You know, guys walk
into his office


1647
01:15:35.756 --> 01:15:37.424
and walk out again

1648
01:15:37.491 --> 01:15:40.494
with $200,000 cash
in a briefcase.


1649
01:15:40.561 --> 01:15:42.063
$200,000?

1650
01:15:42.129 --> 01:15:44.098
Watch him.
Watch him bob and weave.


1651
01:15:46.067 --> 01:15:47.568
Senator,

1652
01:15:47.634 --> 01:15:50.938
now, we at Taft Aerospace
have always prided ourselves


1653
01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:53.274
in truth, on what we produce.

1654
01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:55.843
Charlie does his laundry.

1655
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:57.811
Any idea
where he keeps it?


1656
01:15:57.879 --> 01:16:01.082
Yeah, in the safe
in his office.


1657
01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.289
Fortunately, there are
guards everywhere,


1658
01:16:08.355 --> 01:16:09.991
and I don't even
have a key


1659
01:16:10.057 --> 01:16:12.226
to the executive washroom
anymore.


1660
01:16:12.293 --> 01:16:14.228
Unfortunately,
we've been invited


1661
01:16:14.295 --> 01:16:17.331
to a party at Taft
next week.


1662
01:16:18.665 --> 01:16:21.568
Fortunately,
we don't know


1663
01:16:21.635 --> 01:16:24.105
the first thing
about safe cracking.


1664
01:16:24.171 --> 01:16:28.375
Unfortunately,
we are fast learners.


1665
01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:31.245
Short retirement.

1666
01:16:31.312 --> 01:16:32.880
Very.

1667
01:16:40.554 --> 01:16:41.588
I felt it.

1668
01:16:41.655 --> 01:16:42.789
Oh, positive?

1669
01:16:42.856 --> 01:16:44.025
Of course
I'm positive.


1670
01:16:44.091 --> 01:16:46.227
Honey, it's got
to be perfect.


1671
01:16:46.293 --> 01:16:48.562
I've been practicing
for days.


1672
01:16:48.629 --> 01:16:49.563
You've almost got it.
Come on.


1673
01:16:49.630 --> 01:16:51.298
You ready?

1674
01:16:51.365 --> 01:16:56.403
Deft. Deft. And deft.

1675
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:57.571
Okay, you should tell me

1676
01:16:57.638 --> 01:16:58.872
when you want me
to do it.


1677
01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:00.507
Whenever
you're ready.


1678
01:17:33.074 --> 01:17:34.375
Well, it's just like
old times.


1679
01:17:34.441 --> 01:17:35.676
Mmmm.

1680
01:17:35.742 --> 01:17:37.478
I hope you brought
the old equalizer.


1681
01:17:37.544 --> 01:17:39.880
Will you cut it out?

1682
01:17:39.947 --> 01:17:41.115
Hi, Pete, how are you?

1683
01:17:41.182 --> 01:17:42.716
Who is it?

1684
01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:45.419
Pete Winston. Wife Betty.
Superbowl. Back operation.


1685
01:17:45.486 --> 01:17:47.054
Really good to see you.
How are you?


1686
01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:48.589
Great. Just great.

1687
01:17:48.655 --> 01:17:50.191
You know my wife, Jane,
don't you?


1688
01:17:50.257 --> 01:17:52.526
I don't know if she'll
remember me at all.


1689
01:17:52.593 --> 01:17:53.860
Winston, how can you
say that?


1690
01:17:53.927 --> 01:17:55.062
We met you and Betty

1691
01:17:55.129 --> 01:17:56.530
at the Superbowl
last winter.


1692
01:17:56.597 --> 01:17:57.731
How's your back?

1693
01:17:57.798 --> 01:17:58.799
How nice of you
to remember.


1694
01:17:58.865 --> 01:18:00.034
Is Betty here?

1695
01:18:00.101 --> 01:18:01.135
Yes, she's in the back.

1696
01:18:01.202 --> 01:18:03.337
Oh, I'll be glad to
see her again.


1697
01:18:03.404 --> 01:18:04.571
There you are.

1698
01:18:04.638 --> 01:18:05.572
Charlie.

1699
01:18:05.639 --> 01:18:07.141
What I want to know is

1700
01:18:07.208 --> 01:18:09.776
do I get to kiss your wife,
or do I have to make a scene?


1701
01:18:09.843 --> 01:18:11.145
Do we know this man?

1702
01:18:11.212 --> 01:18:12.646
Some guy who still
works at the plant.


1703
01:18:12.713 --> 01:18:15.716
You betcha. Ohh...

1704
01:18:17.284 --> 01:18:18.585
Hi, Charlie.

1705
01:18:18.652 --> 01:18:19.886
You know, I don't know

1706
01:18:19.953 --> 01:18:20.787
what a good-looking guy
like Dick


1707
01:18:20.854 --> 01:18:21.755
sees in you.

1708
01:18:21.822 --> 01:18:23.024
I do yard work.

1709
01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:23.957
You can work
in my yard anytime.


1710
01:18:24.025 --> 01:18:25.159
Oh, oh, Charlie.

1711
01:18:25.226 --> 01:18:26.593
You want to dance,
Charlie?


1712
01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:28.262
I'd love to.

1713
01:18:31.165 --> 01:18:32.233
Very nice.

1714
01:18:32.299 --> 01:18:34.868
What?
I said, very nice.


1715
01:18:34.935 --> 01:18:37.438
Perfect.

1716
01:20:03.657 --> 01:20:04.925
Charlie, no!

1717
01:20:04.991 --> 01:20:06.893
No? I won't take no
for an answer.


1718
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.495
I'll be waiting.

1719
01:20:28.014 --> 01:20:30.117
Show-off.

1720
01:20:35.989 --> 01:20:37.824
Come on.

1721
01:20:40.994 --> 01:20:42.263
Come on.

1722
01:20:42.329 --> 01:20:43.830
Dick, Charlie's going
to come to his office


1723
01:20:43.897 --> 01:20:45.499
at 11:00.

1724
01:20:45.566 --> 01:20:48.369
We've got to hurry.
All right.


1725
01:20:48.435 --> 01:20:50.171
Will you
get out of the way?


1726
01:20:53.073 --> 01:20:55.309
Hey, you, don't move.

1727
01:20:55.376 --> 01:20:58.212
Ta-ta-ta.

1728
01:20:58.279 --> 01:21:00.547
Take that, you honky putz.

1729
01:21:06.987 --> 01:21:09.723
Oh, my God!
What?


1730
01:21:21.067 --> 01:21:23.204
Come on, will you?

1731
01:21:26.473 --> 01:21:28.742
Come on.

1732
01:21:44.991 --> 01:21:46.560
These are all
make-believe.


1733
01:21:46.627 --> 01:21:47.761
Dick?
What?


1734
01:21:47.828 --> 01:21:48.929
Does he have a closet,

1735
01:21:48.995 --> 01:21:51.064
because I read
in the book


1736
01:21:51.131 --> 01:21:52.866
that the most popular place
for safes


1737
01:21:52.933 --> 01:21:54.067
are in the closet.

1738
01:21:54.134 --> 01:21:56.036
He does indeed
have a closet.


1739
01:22:04.144 --> 01:22:05.312
I love you, Jane.

1740
01:22:05.379 --> 01:22:06.513
Huh?

1741
01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:08.482
Tah-dah!
Thanks.


1742
01:22:08.549 --> 01:22:11.252
Mosler model
number 1874.


1743
01:22:14.921 --> 01:22:20.126
Mosler...okay.

1744
01:22:20.193 --> 01:22:21.495
There.

1745
01:22:21.562 --> 01:22:24.265
Right there is where
you have to drill.


1746
01:22:38.479 --> 01:22:41.014
Dick, it's okay.

1747
01:22:41.081 --> 01:22:43.984
You can hardly hear
the drilling out here.


1748
01:22:53.927 --> 01:22:56.330
Dick, somebody's coming.

1749
01:23:04.505 --> 01:23:06.640
In the closet.

1750
01:23:15.549 --> 01:23:16.817
Is it the guard?

1751
01:23:16.883 --> 01:23:20.654
I don't know.
I couldn't see.


1752
01:23:28.529 --> 01:23:32.165
It can't be Charlie.
It's only 10:15.


1753
01:23:32.232 --> 01:23:34.601
Let me look.

1754
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:38.004
Shh.

1755
01:23:39.573 --> 01:23:41.475
I can't see anything.

1756
01:23:41.542 --> 01:23:43.143
Maybe he won't
look in here.


1757
01:23:43.209 --> 01:23:44.511
Well, suppose he does?

1758
01:23:44.578 --> 01:23:45.779
Screw him.

1759
01:23:45.846 --> 01:23:48.415
I most certainly
will not.


1760
01:24:01.962 --> 01:24:03.797
That wasn't Charlie.

1761
01:24:03.864 --> 01:24:05.332
Really?

1762
01:24:24.585 --> 01:24:27.788
Come on in.

1763
01:24:37.964 --> 01:24:41.735
Hey, everybody,
come on in.


1764
01:24:44.337 --> 01:24:47.273
Hey, my man,
what's happening?


1765
01:25:04.925 --> 01:25:06.527
Jane!

1766
01:25:06.593 --> 01:25:08.194
They're never going to
hear the drill over this.


1767
01:25:08.261 --> 01:25:09.295
I'm going back to work.

1768
01:25:09.362 --> 01:25:10.397
If somebody looks like
he's coming in,


1769
01:25:10.464 --> 01:25:11.665
just let me know.

1770
01:25:45.966 --> 01:25:48.535
Ah, Jane.
It's your turn.


1771
01:26:35.916 --> 01:26:37.584
It's all the money
in the world.


1772
01:26:37.651 --> 01:26:39.452
Oh, it gives me
goose flesh.


1773
01:26:40.921 --> 01:26:42.689
Oh, my God!

1774
01:27:03.443 --> 01:27:07.247
Floor show.
Floor show.


1775
01:27:07.313 --> 01:27:08.682
Aw, come on.

1776
01:27:08.749 --> 01:27:11.284
Knock it off, man.
We're talking business.


1777
01:27:13.319 --> 01:27:14.420
I need more.

1778
01:27:14.487 --> 01:27:17.123
Just a second.

1779
01:27:17.190 --> 01:27:18.892
It feels so good.

1780
01:27:18.959 --> 01:27:21.461
Oh, that's what I've
been looking for.


1781
01:27:21.528 --> 01:27:22.929
Thank you very much.

1782
01:27:22.996 --> 01:27:24.665
Hey, guys, listen,
have a good time tonight.


1783
01:27:24.731 --> 01:27:26.667
Enjoy yourselves, okay?
This is a party.


1784
01:27:35.241 --> 01:27:38.378
Okay. To the elevator.
Around through the boardroom


1785
01:27:38.444 --> 01:27:40.614
and to the left, honey.

1786
01:27:52.092 --> 01:27:53.493
Dick followed me
up here.


1787
01:27:55.328 --> 01:27:56.763
Hey, Charlie.

1788
01:27:56.830 --> 01:27:59.232
Dick, boy. Hi.

1789
01:28:02.168 --> 01:28:03.436
Going down?

1790
01:28:03.503 --> 01:28:05.305
Uh, down, yes.

1791
01:28:05.371 --> 01:28:07.207
Lobby, please.

1792
01:28:07.273 --> 01:28:09.409
Funny, we're going
to the lobby too.


1793
01:28:10.076 --> 01:28:11.945
Oh.

1794
01:28:15.081 --> 01:28:16.282
Well, I...

1795
01:28:16.349 --> 01:28:20.787
I guess we can all
ride together.


1796
01:28:25.125 --> 01:28:27.193
Dick, I don't feel very well.
I think we should go home.


1797
01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:28.161
Oh, wait a minute.

1798
01:28:28.228 --> 01:28:29.295
Not until you have
one drink


1799
01:28:29.362 --> 01:28:30.430
with little old Charlie.

1800
01:28:30.496 --> 01:28:31.865
No, Charlie. I really think
I'm going to faint.


1801
01:28:31.932 --> 01:28:35.101
Oh, here, let me
take your purse.


1802
01:28:35.168 --> 01:28:37.570
One little nightcap.

1803
01:28:54.888 --> 01:28:56.723
Nobility.

1804
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:57.991
Pride.

1805
01:28:58.058 --> 01:28:59.559
A sense of feeling

1806
01:28:59.626 --> 01:29:01.527
that your life
amounts to something.


1807
01:29:01.594 --> 01:29:04.564
That's what we lost when
we lost the space program.


1808
01:29:04.631 --> 01:29:05.565
Sir?

1809
01:29:05.632 --> 01:29:07.801
Nobil... Nobil...
What?


1810
01:29:07.868 --> 01:29:09.202
May I have a word with you
in private, please?


1811
01:29:09.269 --> 01:29:10.771
Right now?
Yes, sir.


1812
01:29:10.837 --> 01:29:12.706
Hey, listen, listen,
don't go away.


1813
01:29:12.773 --> 01:29:15.241
I'll be right back.

1814
01:29:15.308 --> 01:29:16.810
Let's go.

1815
01:29:16.877 --> 01:29:19.079
Where?
Where are we going?


1816
01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:29.055
We were just going to
walk right out of here?


1817
01:29:29.122 --> 01:29:31.324
We were. We were.

1818
01:29:32.893 --> 01:29:34.828
There's nothing
to worry about.


1819
01:29:34.895 --> 01:29:36.462
Charlie wouldn't dare
call the cops.


1820
01:29:36.529 --> 01:29:39.332
This money doesn't exist.
Don't you understand?


1821
01:29:39.399 --> 01:29:40.300
What about all these
security guards?


1822
01:29:40.366 --> 01:29:42.936
Do they exist
or don't they?


1823
01:29:48.141 --> 01:29:49.710
Wait a minute.

1824
01:29:49.776 --> 01:29:51.912
Dick, we've got
to call the cops.


1825
01:29:51.978 --> 01:29:53.313
Are you crazy?

1826
01:29:53.379 --> 01:29:54.881
No, no, I'm not kidding,
I'm not kidding.


1827
01:29:54.948 --> 01:29:55.982
Charlie is never going
to admit


1828
01:29:56.049 --> 01:29:57.350
that there's an
actual slush fund.


1829
01:29:57.417 --> 01:29:58.985
If he sees cops
all around here,


1830
01:29:59.052 --> 01:30:00.620
he's going to make sure

1831
01:30:00.687 --> 01:30:01.822
that we got out of here
safely...


1832
01:30:01.888 --> 01:30:04.991
with the money.

1833
01:30:05.058 --> 01:30:10.296
You're very smart, Jane.

1834
01:30:10.363 --> 01:30:11.898
Have you got a dime?

1835
01:30:11.965 --> 01:30:13.867
A dime?
Yeah.


1836
01:30:13.934 --> 01:30:16.069
No. You?

1837
01:30:19.539 --> 01:30:22.375
Find someone with change
of a thousand dollars,


1838
01:30:22.442 --> 01:30:24.410
for Christ's sake.

1839
01:30:35.121 --> 01:30:37.090
Jane, uh,
feeling better?


1840
01:30:37.157 --> 01:30:38.558
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

1841
01:30:38.624 --> 01:30:39.926
Dick, there's something

1842
01:30:39.993 --> 01:30:41.561
I've been meaning to
ask you all night.


1843
01:30:41.627 --> 01:30:43.496
Shoot.

1844
01:30:43.563 --> 01:30:45.031
What's in the bag?

1845
01:30:45.098 --> 01:30:47.000
Your, uh,
your makeup?


1846
01:30:48.334 --> 01:30:50.737
Charlie, Charlie.

1847
01:30:54.674 --> 01:30:56.076
Charlie, can I
level with you?


1848
01:30:56.142 --> 01:30:57.310
Sure.

1849
01:30:57.377 --> 01:30:58.544
I mean really
level with you.


1850
01:30:58.611 --> 01:31:00.713
You can tell me
anything.


1851
01:31:00.781 --> 01:31:02.749
We just cleaned out
your safe.


1852
01:31:02.816 --> 01:31:06.119
Every last buck.

1853
01:31:08.188 --> 01:31:09.689
Oh, did you, now?

1854
01:31:09.756 --> 01:31:10.690
Yeah.

1855
01:31:10.757 --> 01:31:12.225
I'm sorry.

1856
01:31:12.292 --> 01:31:15.261
I shouldn't have said it
straight out like that,


1857
01:31:15.328 --> 01:31:17.497
but I'm just sick
of all the bullshit,


1858
01:31:17.563 --> 01:31:19.399
you know what I mean?

1859
01:31:19.465 --> 01:31:21.401
How do you two propose
to get out of here?


1860
01:31:21.467 --> 01:31:22.502
Oh, with your help,
Charlie.


1861
01:31:22.568 --> 01:31:24.370
My help?

1862
01:31:24.437 --> 01:31:27.407
Do you see that
big dude over there?


1863
01:31:27.473 --> 01:31:31.111
He can shoot the eye out of
a hummingbird at 50 paces.


1864
01:31:31.177 --> 01:31:33.579
Whooph!

1865
01:31:33.646 --> 01:31:36.783
Charlie, we just
called the cops.


1866
01:31:36.850 --> 01:31:40.253
Huh?

1867
01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:42.555
Ahem.

1868
01:31:49.195 --> 01:31:50.997
We're going to give
ourselves up.


1869
01:31:51.064 --> 01:31:52.298
This is no joke, friends.

1870
01:31:52.365 --> 01:31:54.400
We're going to make
a clean breast of it.


1871
01:31:54.467 --> 01:31:56.937
Don't be stupid.

1872
01:31:57.003 --> 01:31:58.304
You keep your mouth shut,

1873
01:31:58.371 --> 01:31:59.906
and I'll see
that you get out of here.


1874
01:31:59.973 --> 01:32:02.308
With the money?

1875
01:32:06.446 --> 01:32:09.382
You son of a bitch.

1876
01:32:13.019 --> 01:32:14.420
Officers. Ha.

1877
01:32:14.487 --> 01:32:16.556
I'm Charles Blanchard.

1878
01:32:16.622 --> 01:32:19.125
I'm the President
of Taft Aerospace.


1879
01:32:19.192 --> 01:32:21.361
Maybe I can be of help.

1880
01:32:21.427 --> 01:32:23.997
My dear, you have just seen
a demonstration


1881
01:32:24.064 --> 01:32:25.798
of what we in
the corporate world


1882
01:32:25.866 --> 01:32:29.435
refer to as "hardballing it
with the big guys."


1883
01:32:29.502 --> 01:32:31.938
I enjoyed it
thoroughly.


1884
01:32:32.005 --> 01:32:33.273
Would you be embarrassed

1885
01:32:33.339 --> 01:32:35.341
if I kissed you
in a public place?


1886
01:32:35.408 --> 01:32:36.376
I'd be embarrassed

1887
01:32:36.442 --> 01:32:37.510
if you kissed me
in a private place


1888
01:32:37.577 --> 01:32:40.713
with all these
people around.


1889
01:32:41.547 --> 01:32:43.083
I'm afraid, officer,

1890
01:32:43.149 --> 01:32:45.518
that you've been the victim
of a drunken prankster,


1891
01:32:45.585 --> 01:32:47.487
but if you'd excuse me
for just a minute,


1892
01:32:47.553 --> 01:32:50.823
this young lady
isn't feeling very well.


1893
01:32:50.891 --> 01:32:51.925
Oh, I'm sorry.

1894
01:32:51.992 --> 01:32:53.193
Yeah, if I could just

1895
01:32:53.259 --> 01:32:54.094
get these two folks
out of here,


1896
01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:55.862
I'd feel a lot better.

1897
01:32:55.929 --> 01:32:57.998
Then we can talk about
that ridiculous story


1898
01:32:58.064 --> 01:33:00.766
about my safe.

1899
01:33:00.833 --> 01:33:01.935
Jane?

1900
01:33:02.002 --> 01:33:02.869
Come...
come along, Jane.


1901
01:33:02.936 --> 01:33:03.836
Come along.

1902
01:33:03.904 --> 01:33:05.906
Jane?

1903
01:33:34.534 --> 01:33:37.670
* Wise men say
all things go too fast *


1904
01:33:37.737 --> 01:33:41.975
* And babies don't last

1905
01:33:42.042 --> 01:33:45.078
* They grow up as soon
as they get the chance *


1906
01:33:45.145 --> 01:33:49.249
* Let's face it

1907
01:33:49.315 --> 01:33:52.953
* A whole new way
of behavin' *


1908
01:33:53.019 --> 01:33:55.455
* With brand-new rules
to break *


1909
01:33:55.521 --> 01:33:56.656
* Wah-hoo!

1910
01:33:56.722 --> 01:33:59.059
* How time flies

1911
01:33:59.125 --> 01:34:06.166
* We were once
ahead of the game *


1912
01:34:06.232 --> 01:34:12.772
* Can you remember
when gettin' up was easy? *


1913
01:34:12.838 --> 01:34:14.340
* No sweat

1914
01:34:14.407 --> 01:34:21.481
* And we could exist
on wax and gum completely *


1915
01:34:21.547 --> 01:34:25.318
* The things we used to think
were crazy *


1916
01:34:25.385 --> 01:34:27.620
* Now they seem
so very sane *


1917
01:34:27.687 --> 01:34:28.989
* Wah-hoo!

1918
01:34:29.055 --> 01:34:31.357
* How time flies

1919
01:34:31.424 --> 01:34:35.428
* We were once
ahead of the game *


1920
01:34:35.495 --> 01:34:36.396
* Wah-hoo!

1921
01:34:36.462 --> 01:34:38.731
* How time flies

1922
01:34:38.798 --> 01:34:43.136
* We were once
ahead of the game *


1923
01:34:43.203 --> 01:34:46.939
* Love hit us
right between the eyes *


1924
01:34:47.007 --> 01:34:48.308
* It wasn't fair

1925
01:34:48.374 --> 01:34:50.176
* We never had a chance

1926
01:34:50.243 --> 01:34:54.480
* Sometimes
you have to sit right back *


1927
01:34:54.547 --> 01:34:55.815
* And laugh

1928
01:34:55.881 --> 01:34:59.986
* It goes so fast

1929
01:35:18.804 --> 01:35:22.442
* As sure as there's
a Sunday morning, baby *


1930
01:35:22.508 --> 01:35:24.777
* We're going to get
our piece of the cake *


1931
01:35:24.844 --> 01:35:26.012
* Wah-hoo!

1932
01:35:26.079 --> 01:35:28.148
* How time flies

1933
01:35:28.214 --> 01:35:32.452
* We were once
ahead of the game *


1934
01:35:32.518 --> 01:35:34.120
* Wah-hoo!
