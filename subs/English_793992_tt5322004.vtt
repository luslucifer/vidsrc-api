2
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.346
Come on! That boat's, like,
a light year away!


3
00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:38.953
At some point, I'm gonna start
taking this personally!


4
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.991
You can't just ignore me,
Raymond! I'm not your wife!


5
00:00:44.058 --> 00:00:45.293
Asshole.

6
00:00:57.371 --> 00:00:58.806
Aren't you supposed
to get somebody


7
00:00:58.873 --> 00:01:00.475
to ride that with you?

8
00:01:05.947 --> 00:01:07.782
Take it off!

9
00:03:41.702 --> 00:03:44.272
Just these.

10
00:03:44.338 --> 00:03:46.307
Oh!

11
00:03:46.374 --> 00:03:47.508
These too.

12
00:03:47.575 --> 00:03:50.578
Those don't always
work, you know.


13
00:03:50.645 --> 00:03:52.513
Okay.

14
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.816
Oh, babe, but
I like bubble gum.


15
00:03:55.883 --> 00:03:58.419
"But I like bubble gum."

16
00:03:58.486 --> 00:04:01.188
The condoms.
Talking about the condoms.


17
00:04:01.255 --> 00:04:03.624
First, you two get handsy in
the back of his mom's Jetta.


18
00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:05.593
You say some cheesy line
about how hot she is.


19
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.228
She massages her nipples.

20
00:04:07.295 --> 00:04:09.931
And then after warming
up his stick shift with


21
00:04:09.997 --> 00:04:12.833
the Cabbage Patch lip gloss,

22
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.735
you would gently
slip on a Trojan,


23
00:04:14.802 --> 00:04:16.304
the mightiest of
soldiers, and you think,


24
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.273
"Great, now I'm not
gonna get pregnant."


25
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.409
But you're wrong,
Hannah Montana.


26
00:04:21.475 --> 00:04:24.011
Maybe there's no baby, but
sure enough, the condom rips,


27
00:04:24.078 --> 00:04:26.981
and you get chlamydia...

28
00:04:27.048 --> 00:04:29.183
God's punishment for
the sexually-active.


29
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.419
You gotta get a shot from
your judgmental pediatrician


30
00:04:31.485 --> 00:04:33.220
who still wears
Mickey Mouse ties.


31
00:04:33.287 --> 00:04:34.689
You better hope
that's all you get,


32
00:04:34.755 --> 00:04:38.526
because, worse-case scenario,
you're pregnant and dead,


33
00:04:38.592 --> 00:04:41.529
all because he stuck his
dick in some SAT tutor


34
00:04:41.595 --> 00:04:42.897
before he shoved it in you.

35
00:04:45.766 --> 00:04:47.234
That's gonna be $7.50.

36
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.435
You look like shit.

37
00:05:21.502 --> 00:05:23.571
Say that about
my grandson again,


38
00:05:23.637 --> 00:05:25.106
and you'll pay for it later.

39
00:05:25.172 --> 00:05:28.409
Oh, yeah? Well, you look
like shit. Come here.


40
00:05:28.476 --> 00:05:30.978
I am begging
you guys to stop.


41
00:05:31.045 --> 00:05:32.013
Oh!

42
00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:34.582
Also, Janine is relentless.

43
00:05:34.648 --> 00:05:36.384
Put that damn
duck in the drawer


44
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.719
with the rest of 'em, will you?

45
00:05:38.786 --> 00:05:39.720
Okay?

46
00:05:39.787 --> 00:05:40.921
Yeah.

47
00:05:40.988 --> 00:05:42.089
Your graduation is tomorrow.

48
00:05:42.156 --> 00:05:43.724
- Oh my god, it is?
- Yeah,


49
00:05:43.791 --> 00:05:45.659
and I think that it'd be
very nice if you went.


50
00:05:45.726 --> 00:05:47.428
Yeah, but then I'd miss
the "Golden Girls" marathon.


51
00:05:47.495 --> 00:05:49.930
Has it ever occurred to you
that we might want to go


52
00:05:49.997 --> 00:05:50.931
and celebrate your
accomplishments,


53
00:05:50.998 --> 00:05:52.233
however mediocre they might be?

54
00:05:52.299 --> 00:05:54.702
No one's stopping you, Benny.
Enjoy it.


55
00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:56.270
And try
and get some sleep!


56
00:05:56.337 --> 00:05:58.539
You really do look like shit.

57
00:05:58.606 --> 00:06:00.274
Thank you.

58
00:06:24.298 --> 00:06:26.734
- Caleb Cohn?
- Yeah.


59
00:06:37.745 --> 00:06:38.979
Good morning.

60
00:06:39.046 --> 00:06:42.049
Nice to meet you, Mr. Cohn.

61
00:06:42.116 --> 00:06:44.518
I'm Dr. Diaz.
So, what are we doing today?


62
00:06:44.585 --> 00:06:46.454
Uh, an STD check?

63
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.822
Yeah, that's
kind of why I'm here.


64
00:06:47.888 --> 00:06:49.824
I just wanna, like,
test the shit out of me


65
00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.525
so all this can be over.

66
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.795
The condom broke.

67
00:06:54.862 --> 00:06:58.566
Yeah, apparently it was expired
like a fucking avocado.


68
00:06:58.632 --> 00:07:00.401
- When did that happen?
- Last Thursday night.


69
00:07:00.468 --> 00:07:02.570
I went to this new biker
bar called The Ram Rod.


70
00:07:02.636 --> 00:07:04.038
Met this Slavic guy

71
00:07:04.105 --> 00:07:08.342
who knew every single Best
Actress winner since 1962,


72
00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:09.710
so I had sex with him.

73
00:07:09.777 --> 00:07:10.978
Okay.

74
00:07:11.045 --> 00:07:14.115
He sent me a
message last night.


75
00:07:14.181 --> 00:07:16.750
"Ahoj, Caleb.

76
00:07:16.817 --> 00:07:18.953
"I tested HIV-positive Monday.

77
00:07:19.019 --> 00:07:20.521
"Swear I not know.

78
00:07:20.588 --> 00:07:23.624
"I'm sure you make joke on
this I no understand, bye.


79
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:25.292
Zander."

80
00:07:26.794 --> 00:07:28.696
Well, you've come
to the right place.


81
00:07:28.762 --> 00:07:32.266
We'll test you for all STDs and
have your HIV baseline today.


82
00:07:32.333 --> 00:07:34.068
Then you can make
appointments to the front desk


83
00:07:34.135 --> 00:07:36.237
to come back for
your HIV re-checks.


84
00:07:36.303 --> 00:07:38.038
No, no need to re-check.

85
00:07:38.105 --> 00:07:40.441
I am officially
celibate until death.


86
00:07:40.508 --> 00:07:41.742
Right.

87
00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:43.611
Look, today's test
won't determine whether


88
00:07:43.677 --> 00:07:46.614
you contracted the virus
from this exposure.


89
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.315
The test looks for
HIV antibodies,


90
00:07:48.382 --> 00:07:50.484
and they take time to develop.

91
00:07:50.551 --> 00:07:51.685
In the meantime,

92
00:07:51.752 --> 00:07:54.321
I run a support
group twice a week.


93
00:07:54.388 --> 00:07:55.823
We'd be happy to have you.

94
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.926
Yeah, but, like, I
don't even know if I have it.


95
00:07:58.993 --> 00:08:02.229
Well, it's not only
for people who are positive.


96
00:08:02.296 --> 00:08:05.065
This is sort of a any queer
person who wants to talk


97
00:08:05.132 --> 00:08:06.800
and eat free cookies
kind of group,


98
00:08:06.867 --> 00:08:10.104
so it's for people in
your position, too.


99
00:08:10.171 --> 00:08:15.109
Okay, and, um,
typically how long


100
00:08:15.176 --> 00:08:16.977
does somebody in my
position have to wait


101
00:08:17.044 --> 00:08:20.147
to know if they
have it for sure?


102
00:09:20.908 --> 00:09:22.142
'Bout time, bitch.

103
00:09:22.209 --> 00:09:24.812
I'm sorry.
What'd I miss?


104
00:09:24.878 --> 00:09:26.146
Fuck if I know.

105
00:09:26.213 --> 00:09:27.982
Fell asleep when Chloe
dedicated her diploma


106
00:09:28.048 --> 00:09:30.017
to Jesus and Jeb Bush.

107
00:09:30.084 --> 00:09:31.418
Gross.

108
00:09:31.485 --> 00:09:33.454
Kristy Quinlon.

109
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.888
Did they
make it to the Vs?


110
00:09:34.955 --> 00:09:37.458
Who cares if Dom
has walked yet? It's over.


111
00:09:37.524 --> 00:09:39.493
All I ever wanted was
a boy to dry hump me


112
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.862
in the back of his dad's Prius,
and now that dream is dead.


113
00:09:41.929 --> 00:09:43.864
- You're so dramatic.
- I'm in mourning.


114
00:09:43.931 --> 00:09:45.766
You're always
mourning something.


115
00:09:45.833 --> 00:09:47.434
First of all, rude.

116
00:09:47.501 --> 00:09:48.936
Second of all, it's different.

117
00:09:49.003 --> 00:09:50.704
It's Dom.

118
00:09:50.771 --> 00:09:51.872
Sarah Stein.

119
00:09:51.939 --> 00:09:53.941
Made these for you.

120
00:09:54.008 --> 00:09:55.609
Oh, so Suzanne
didn't want them?


121
00:09:55.676 --> 00:09:57.678
I don't know why she
keeps rejecting my quiche.


122
00:09:57.745 --> 00:10:00.381
You know, it could be
because she's our boss?


123
00:10:00.447 --> 00:10:02.783
Didn't stop her from
eating it last summer.


124
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.619
Look, I know this is hard,

125
00:10:05.686 --> 00:10:06.987
but you gotta look
at the upside.


126
00:10:07.054 --> 00:10:10.491
Now you get to sit on a
new face, a better face.


127
00:10:10.557 --> 00:10:12.660
Andy Terasaki.

128
00:10:12.726 --> 00:10:17.898
- Maybe I already did.
- Of course you already did!


129
00:10:17.965 --> 00:10:18.999
Who's the guy?

130
00:10:19.066 --> 00:10:20.968
His name was Zander.

131
00:10:21.035 --> 00:10:22.236
He didn't speak a
word of English,


132
00:10:22.303 --> 00:10:25.205
he was part Slav,
part, like, horse.


133
00:10:25.272 --> 00:10:26.674
Was?

134
00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.543
Yeah, he to fly back to
Belgrade a couple days ago.


135
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.979
He sent me a message.

136
00:10:32.046 --> 00:10:34.782
Dom Valdez.

137
00:10:43.457 --> 00:10:45.159
Sarah Valdez.

138
00:10:45.225 --> 00:10:47.928
Caleb.

139
00:10:47.995 --> 00:10:50.764
You're gonna be okay.

140
00:10:50.831 --> 00:10:52.032
Am I?

141
00:10:52.099 --> 00:10:56.570
People live with
this shit forever now.


142
00:10:56.637 --> 00:11:00.341
Kinda feel like I live
with enough shit already.


143
00:11:00.407 --> 00:11:03.510
Did you tell your grandma?

144
00:11:03.577 --> 00:11:05.946
Why scare a woman who's
already lost her only son


145
00:11:06.013 --> 00:11:10.984
when I can just, like, quietly
die alone on the inside?


146
00:11:11.051 --> 00:11:16.190
And now once again, class
valedictorian Chloe Smith.


147
00:11:17.725 --> 00:11:19.626
Congrats,
class of 2011.


148
00:11:19.693 --> 00:11:22.396
We did it!

149
00:11:41.014 --> 00:11:42.649
Hey.

150
00:11:42.716 --> 00:11:46.920
So I spent the last couple of
days looking at... AIDS stuff.


151
00:11:46.987 --> 00:11:48.756
Jesus, fuck, Dara!

152
00:11:48.822 --> 00:11:50.924
Did your doctor
tell you about PEP?


153
00:11:50.991 --> 00:11:52.292
He did not.

154
00:11:52.359 --> 00:11:54.194
Well, it's this thing
that you take right after


155
00:11:54.261 --> 00:11:57.965
you've been exposed, and it
can help get rid of AIDS.


156
00:11:58.031 --> 00:11:59.633
Okay, but this says
you can only take it


157
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.068
up to three days
after having sex.


158
00:12:01.135 --> 00:12:04.738
- It's been, like, a week.
- Isn't it work asking about?


159
00:12:12.546 --> 00:12:13.714
Pride Center.

160
00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:14.982
Yeah, hi, I'm
looking for Dr. Diaz.


161
00:12:15.048 --> 00:12:16.550
Oh, he's not
available right now.


162
00:12:16.617 --> 00:12:18.919
Please, it's a super-quick
life-or-death question.


163
00:12:18.986 --> 00:12:20.287
If this is a medical
emergency,


164
00:12:20.354 --> 00:12:21.955
please hang up and dial 911.

165
00:12:22.022 --> 00:12:24.057
I can't, they
hate me over there.


166
00:12:24.124 --> 00:12:25.492
He's upstairs
at his group meeting


167
00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:28.362
if you want to come by.

168
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.064
- I gotta leave early.
- Okay.


169
00:12:31.131 --> 00:12:34.234
Uhhh, ah.

170
00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:35.569
Sorry I'm late.

171
00:12:35.636 --> 00:12:37.805
I got stuck
with the principal!


172
00:12:37.871 --> 00:12:41.208
Riley won't stop drawing
boobs on his homework.


173
00:12:41.275 --> 00:12:42.443
He's obsessed.

174
00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:43.844
I don't know where
he gets this from.


175
00:12:45.779 --> 00:12:48.115
Caleb, can you help me
replace the slushee machine?


176
00:12:48.182 --> 00:12:50.384
It's so heavy.

177
00:12:50.451 --> 00:12:51.518
I can do it.

178
00:12:51.585 --> 00:12:54.054
I've been lifting.

179
00:12:55.522 --> 00:12:58.058
Okay.

180
00:12:59.059 --> 00:13:01.628
Go! Go, you have to!

181
00:13:31.792 --> 00:13:33.393
- Hi.
- You came.


182
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.695
What is PEP?

183
00:13:34.761 --> 00:13:37.764
And how can I get on
it, like, right now?


184
00:13:37.831 --> 00:13:40.167
Why don't we grab a coffee?

185
00:13:40.234 --> 00:13:43.737
It's only effective within
three days of exposure.


186
00:13:43.804 --> 00:13:46.073
And why did you not
tell me about that before?


187
00:13:46.139 --> 00:13:47.908
Because I didn't want to
tell you about something


188
00:13:47.975 --> 00:13:49.009
you couldn't use.

189
00:13:49.076 --> 00:13:50.744
- It's been, like, a week.
- Caleb.


190
00:13:50.811 --> 00:13:53.580
Maybe it'll still work.
Can we just, like...


191
00:13:53.647 --> 00:13:56.917
Can we just, like, try, please?

192
00:14:01.054 --> 00:14:03.524
Listen, I want you to
stay for group tonight.


193
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:05.025
You haven't lived
until you've tried


194
00:14:05.092 --> 00:14:08.462
one of Lisha's donuts,
so do yourself a favor.


195
00:14:08.529 --> 00:14:12.566
Oh, and we go to karaoke after.

196
00:14:12.633 --> 00:14:15.469
All right, guys,
let's bring it in.


197
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.406
Welcome to "The Young
and The Sexless."


198
00:14:19.473 --> 00:14:21.008
Jim, you're up.

199
00:14:22.309 --> 00:14:24.811
Hi, I'm Jim, and I'm
married to Dr. Oz.


200
00:14:24.878 --> 00:14:27.481
Well, I've been positive...

201
00:14:35.289 --> 00:14:37.724
I saw that.

202
00:14:39.393 --> 00:14:41.461
Would you like a prize?

203
00:14:41.528 --> 00:14:44.665
Not if it's one
of those donuts.


204
00:14:46.667 --> 00:14:49.136
...their lives and their
sex lives


205
00:14:49.202 --> 00:14:51.271
aren't over after diagnosis.

206
00:14:51.338 --> 00:14:53.707
Anywho,
once we found out,


207
00:14:53.774 --> 00:14:55.943
we did all the right things

208
00:14:56.009 --> 00:14:58.779
to ensure that
Adrian was protected.


209
00:14:58.845 --> 00:15:02.149
Undetectable means
untransmittable.


210
00:15:02.215 --> 00:15:03.584
Both, uh, true fact

211
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.586
and the title of
my upcoming memoir.


212
00:15:07.354 --> 00:15:09.022
How about you?

213
00:15:09.089 --> 00:15:11.558
You care to share?

214
00:15:11.625 --> 00:15:14.761
Okay, um, well, I'm Caleb.

215
00:15:14.828 --> 00:15:18.832
I, um... I'm here
because a condom broke.


216
00:15:18.899 --> 00:15:20.867
The guy had HIV, and now
I'm waiting to find out


217
00:15:20.934 --> 00:15:23.737
if I do, too. Oldest story in...

218
00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.710
...book or something.

219
00:15:29.776 --> 00:15:31.612
Uh, I'm supposed to
go to Parsons,


220
00:15:31.678 --> 00:15:33.647
but their tuition
costs as much as


221
00:15:33.714 --> 00:15:37.184
a small chain of
islands, so, we'll see.


222
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.587
Oh, and I work at the
mini-mart on 72nd,


223
00:15:40.654 --> 00:15:43.724
so, slushee
discounts all around.


224
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.158
That's great.

225
00:15:45.225 --> 00:15:47.928
Thank you, Caleb.

226
00:15:47.995 --> 00:15:50.597
And Estha?

227
00:15:53.734 --> 00:15:58.338
Hi. Um, my name's Estha,

228
00:15:58.405 --> 00:16:02.009
and, uh, I'm also waiting.

I brought you a karaoke book.

238
00:16:40.981 --> 00:16:42.416
I don't know if you
already have one,


239
00:16:42.482 --> 00:16:44.918
but I thought you might need
one if you wanted to sing?


240
00:16:44.985 --> 00:16:47.120
I don't do
karaoke, I'm tone-deaf.


241
00:16:47.187 --> 00:16:49.089

Oh, no, no.

246
00:16:59.733 --> 00:17:01.334
No, the last time I did karaoke,

247
00:17:01.401 --> 00:17:03.570
I totally butchered my
favorite Bowie song,


248
00:17:03.637 --> 00:17:06.173
and I still feel the shame.

249
00:17:06.239 --> 00:17:07.307
Who's that?

250
00:17:07.374 --> 00:17:09.009
Bowie.

251
00:17:09.076 --> 00:17:12.212
Like, David Bowie.
Like, Ziggy Stardust.


252
00:17:12.279 --> 00:17:13.814
Kinda looks like a man,
kinda looks like an alien,


253
00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.082
kinda looks like something

254
00:17:15.148 --> 00:17:17.684
you'd want to avoid
in a dark basement.


255
00:17:17.751 --> 00:17:19.720
Nope.

256
00:17:21.354 --> 00:17:25.325
Do you live under
a rock or something?


257
00:17:25.392 --> 00:17:26.727
No, I'm from India.

258
00:17:26.793 --> 00:17:28.462
Plenty of rocks in India.

259
00:17:28.528 --> 00:17:29.930
Sorry?

260
00:17:29.996 --> 00:17:31.698
Okay, well, what
would you sing


261
00:17:31.765 --> 00:17:32.933
if you had to sing something?

262
00:17:32.999 --> 00:17:34.401
Out of American music?

263
00:17:34.468 --> 00:17:36.269
Sure.

264
00:17:36.336 --> 00:17:37.738
Probably Taylor Swift.

265
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.541
Oh my god, you're serious.

266
00:17:41.608 --> 00:17:43.610
What? Sometimes I feel like
she steals my journal


267
00:17:43.677 --> 00:17:45.779
and writes about my life.

268
00:17:45.846 --> 00:17:47.347
Is her next crossover
hit gonna be called,


269
00:17:47.414 --> 00:17:50.650
"This Is What I Get
For Riding Bareback?"


270
00:17:55.589 --> 00:17:57.591

It was
cool to meet you.


274
00:18:11.705 --> 00:18:13.940
It's good
to meet you too.


275
00:18:14.007 --> 00:18:17.744
Did you, um... did
you drive here?


276
00:18:17.811 --> 00:18:19.746
No, I, uh, took the bus.

277
00:18:19.813 --> 00:18:22.249
I have to, uh, ask my
parents' permission


278
00:18:22.315 --> 00:18:25.452
to use their car
specifically for my friends.


279
00:18:25.519 --> 00:18:28.421
Yeah, yeah, I haven't
told my grandma either.


280
00:18:28.488 --> 00:18:30.357
It's just easier since
they don't know about


281
00:18:30.423 --> 00:18:35.395
the whole gay thing.

282
00:18:35.462 --> 00:18:37.664
Do you want a ride?

283
00:18:37.731 --> 00:18:39.933
I have a tandem bike.

284
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.067
That means two people can...

285
00:18:41.134 --> 00:18:43.570
I know what a tandem bike is.

286
00:18:43.637 --> 00:18:46.873
You didn't know Bowie, so,
like, I didn't want to assume.


287
00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:51.178
I, uh... I live a
couple miles away.


288
00:18:51.244 --> 00:18:54.815
That's okay.
Uh, you can help me pedal.


289
00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:58.819
Okay.

290
00:18:58.885 --> 00:19:02.389
Cool. Um, I parked
in this creepy side alley.


291
00:19:02.455 --> 00:19:05.725
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna murder you.


292
00:19:05.792 --> 00:19:08.361
You say very strange things.

293
00:19:08.428 --> 00:19:10.063
I get that a lot.

294
00:19:17.771 --> 00:19:19.105
How's it going back there?

295
00:19:19.172 --> 00:19:20.707
I'm afraid you're gonna crash.

296
00:19:20.774 --> 00:19:23.176
It's my dad's bike.
I can ride with my eyes closed.


297
00:19:23.243 --> 00:19:25.478
Yeah, I really
rather you didn't.


298
00:19:25.545 --> 00:19:28.348
Noted.

299
00:19:28.415 --> 00:19:31.551
So when did you start
going to those meetings?


300
00:19:31.618 --> 00:19:33.153
About three weeks ago.

301
00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.089
It's nice to talk
to people, so...


302
00:19:36.156 --> 00:19:37.624
Watch out for the pothole.

303
00:19:37.691 --> 00:19:41.228
Sure.

304
00:19:41.294 --> 00:19:44.164
Well, how'd you get into this
mess in the first place?


305
00:19:44.231 --> 00:19:47.234
Last year my parents
started introducing me


306
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.904
to their friends' daughters,
and every time I say no,


307
00:19:50.971 --> 00:19:52.472
there'd be another one waiting.

308
00:19:52.539 --> 00:19:53.707
Assembly line dating?

309
00:19:53.773 --> 00:19:56.009
Yeah, my mom did the
exact same thing.


310
00:19:56.076 --> 00:19:57.310
Is she conservative?

311
00:19:57.377 --> 00:19:58.378
Oh, she's Jewish.

312
00:19:58.445 --> 00:19:59.980
Orthodox Jewish.

313
00:20:00.046 --> 00:20:04.985
Yeah, mentally and emotionally,
she's stuck in a shtetl in 1805.


314
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.756
You can stop here.

315
00:20:12.659 --> 00:20:14.361
So this is you, huh?

316
00:20:14.427 --> 00:20:17.464
It's cool. You got a great lawn.
Says a lot about a person.


317
00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:21.067
Hmm, look at those
really nice bushes.


318
00:20:21.134 --> 00:20:23.904
Perfectly trimmed, A-plus.

319
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:26.907
Actually, I live
down the street,


320
00:20:26.973 --> 00:20:29.976
but I'll just walk.

321
00:20:30.043 --> 00:20:31.444
Do I give off, like,

322
00:20:31.511 --> 00:20:33.880
a serial killer
vibe or something?


323
00:20:33.947 --> 00:20:36.683
No, but my dad stays up late,
and I didn't want him seeing


324
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.053
a white boy drop me off
on a gay two-man bike.


325
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.821
Might raise some questions.

326
00:20:41.888 --> 00:20:44.057
Got it.

327
00:20:44.124 --> 00:20:46.760
You seem nervous.

328
00:20:46.826 --> 00:20:48.929
No, I get, uh,

329
00:20:48.995 --> 00:20:50.830
a little too talkative
around guys sometimes.


330
00:20:50.897 --> 00:20:53.166
It's, like, I ask
a lot of questions.


331
00:20:53.233 --> 00:20:56.369
It's the thing that I do
that I might be working on.


332
00:20:56.436 --> 00:21:00.707
I meant about
what's happening.


333
00:21:00.774 --> 00:21:02.642
The waiting.

334
00:21:02.709 --> 00:21:04.444
Um, yeah.

335
00:21:04.511 --> 00:21:07.747
Yeah, sleeping's hard.

336
00:21:07.814 --> 00:21:11.318
That was very embarrassing,
by the way, when I implied that


337
00:21:11.384 --> 00:21:13.486
I get nervous around
you for being a guy.


338
00:21:13.553 --> 00:21:15.956
If you can't sleep,
you can call me.


339
00:21:16.022 --> 00:21:18.024
Sometimes I can't sleep either,

340
00:21:18.091 --> 00:21:22.462
and, uh, don't really have
anybody to talk to.


341
00:21:35.642 --> 00:21:39.179
Are you writing your
number on a Subway coupon?


342
00:21:43.183 --> 00:21:45.885
You can type it in my phone.

343
00:22:00.233 --> 00:22:01.835
Are you going to
the next meeting?


344
00:22:01.901 --> 00:22:04.437
Shh.

345
00:22:05.271 --> 00:22:07.407
Should I take that as a yes?

346
00:22:15.548 --> 00:22:16.950
This is
the true story...


347
00:22:17.017 --> 00:22:18.118
True story...

348
00:22:18.184 --> 00:22:19.486
Of seven strangers...

349
00:22:20.587 --> 00:22:21.888
Picked to
live in a house...


350
00:22:21.955 --> 00:22:23.123
And have
their lives taped...


351
00:22:23.189 --> 00:22:25.158
Oh, Lucy, I'm home.

352
00:22:25.225 --> 00:22:26.459
To find
out what happens...


353
00:22:26.526 --> 00:22:29.329
When people
stop being polite...


354
00:22:29.396 --> 00:22:30.597
And start getting real.

355
00:22:30.663 --> 00:22:34.067
"The Real World:
San Francisco."


356
00:22:34.134 --> 00:22:35.769
I used to
go around to schools


357
00:22:35.835 --> 00:22:38.805
and I speak about HIV and AIDS.

358
00:22:38.872 --> 00:22:41.508
I'm HIV-positive.

359
00:22:41.574 --> 00:22:43.376
When Pedro told
me he was HIV-positive,


360
00:22:43.443 --> 00:22:46.746
it was just, like,
"No, not him."


361
00:22:46.813 --> 00:22:48.114
I like this guy,

362
00:22:48.181 --> 00:22:49.749
and I don't want him
to have to suffer.


363
00:22:51.518 --> 00:22:54.220
I had an incredible time
talking to him on the train.


364
00:22:54.287 --> 00:22:56.923
Have you, uh,
been in a relationship?


365
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.292
The longest relationship
I ever had is a year and a half.


366
00:23:00.827 --> 00:23:02.762
And, I don't know.
I don't think I've ever...


367
00:23:02.829 --> 00:23:07.667
I don't really think
I've ever been in love.


368
00:23:07.734 --> 00:23:11.004
I get very
twisted, and, uh...


369
00:23:14.107 --> 00:23:15.241
What did you do
down there?


370
00:23:15.308 --> 00:23:17.444
What did you do for a living?

371
00:23:35.929 --> 00:23:38.298
...I'm still pretty
uncertain about, you know,


372
00:23:38.364 --> 00:23:40.100
meeting five people,

373
00:23:40.166 --> 00:23:41.968
and I don't know how they
going to feel about me


374
00:23:42.035 --> 00:23:44.604
being HIV-positive.

375
00:23:47.474 --> 00:23:49.609
Look at
your phone, bitch!


376
00:23:52.312 --> 00:23:54.214
Look at
your phone, bitch!


377
00:23:57.117 --> 00:24:00.687
Look at
your phone, bitch!


378
00:24:15.635 --> 00:24:20.607
Hey, it's the Pride
Center calling for Caleb Cohn.


379
00:24:20.673 --> 00:24:23.176
Dr. Diaz would like you to
stop by the clinic today.


380
00:24:23.243 --> 00:24:25.311
Okay, thanks.

381
00:24:25.378 --> 00:24:29.415
Caleb,
Dara's waiting for you!


382
00:24:29.482 --> 00:24:32.485
Oh, the Orion Condominium.

383
00:24:32.552 --> 00:24:34.654
Hmm, it's got a kosher
deli in the lobby.


384
00:24:34.721 --> 00:24:36.122
Mm-hmm.

385
00:24:36.189 --> 00:24:37.790
But 25% off on
Thursdays for the residents.


386
00:24:37.857 --> 00:24:40.860
And you want me to turn
in my home for a coupon?


387
00:24:40.927 --> 00:24:44.197
I would. Their noodle kugel
is next level.


388
00:24:44.264 --> 00:24:46.232
The food here is good, too.

389
00:24:46.299 --> 00:24:49.269
See? There he is!
Hey, tell me something.


390
00:24:49.335 --> 00:24:50.537
Which one would you choose

391
00:24:50.603 --> 00:24:52.438
for your grandmother
to live in with me?


392
00:24:52.505 --> 00:24:53.973
- Um...
- Don't distract him.


393
00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.910
He's got enough on his mind
without worrying about


394
00:24:56.976 --> 00:24:59.112
what nursing home
we should die in.


395
00:24:59.179 --> 00:25:00.880
Well, technically,
it's not a nursing home.


396
00:25:00.947 --> 00:25:03.783
It's a luxury condominium.

397
00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.451
I promise I'll stop talking now.

398
00:25:05.518 --> 00:25:07.954
Okay, as
lovely as this has been,


399
00:25:08.021 --> 00:25:09.756
um, we should go.

400
00:25:09.822 --> 00:25:12.325
You should have some
coffee before you leave


401
00:25:12.392 --> 00:25:14.527
because you look exhausted.

402
00:25:14.594 --> 00:25:17.163
These compliments so early.
Thank you.


403
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.499
Thanks for the fish!

404
00:25:19.566 --> 00:25:22.268
Does he seem different to you?

405
00:25:22.335 --> 00:25:24.437
When does he not
seem different?


406
00:25:26.105 --> 00:25:28.841
- We're gonna be late for work.
- Oh, I'm not going to work.


407
00:25:28.908 --> 00:25:30.343
- What?
- Yeah.


408
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:32.111
I am truly devastated to report

409
00:25:32.178 --> 00:25:33.913
that I have to go
back to the clinic.


410
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.615
Again? Why?

411
00:25:35.682 --> 00:25:39.652
I don't know, so, naturally,
I'm assuming the worst.


412
00:25:39.719 --> 00:25:40.887
All right, well,

413
00:25:40.954 --> 00:25:43.022
I guess I'll do
inventory by myself then.


414
00:25:43.089 --> 00:25:46.025
You're the messiah!
Owe you forever, love you, bye!


415
00:26:09.682 --> 00:26:10.850
Am I gonna die?

416
00:26:10.917 --> 00:26:12.352
Do you have any
plans to kill yourself?


417
00:26:12.418 --> 00:26:13.519
Not at the moment.

418
00:26:13.586 --> 00:26:14.854
Then
you're not gonna die.


419
00:26:14.921 --> 00:26:17.957
I will not let the anal
gonorrhea take you down.


420
00:26:18.024 --> 00:26:21.294
The fuck? Is that worse
than normal gonorrhea?


421
00:26:21.361 --> 00:26:22.729
No, it's
just on the anus.


422
00:26:22.795 --> 00:26:25.198
- You mean my butt?
- I'm a doctor, I mean anus.


423
00:26:25.265 --> 00:26:26.366
Okay, but I don't
have any symptoms.


424
00:26:26.432 --> 00:26:27.700
Any soreness?

425
00:26:27.767 --> 00:26:29.168
I guess, but
I just thought was from,


426
00:26:29.235 --> 00:26:31.304
like, getting railed.

427
00:26:31.371 --> 00:26:33.706
We'll take care of
the infection today.


428
00:26:33.773 --> 00:26:36.009
But you should know that
the presence of gonorrhea


429
00:26:36.075 --> 00:26:39.479
can help the contraction of HIV.

430
00:26:39.545 --> 00:26:42.749
Are you allergic to any
medications, like penicillin?


431
00:26:42.815 --> 00:26:44.083
I don't think so.

432
00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:45.218
All right.

433
00:26:45.285 --> 00:26:47.887
Now, hop off the
table and bend over.


434
00:26:47.954 --> 00:26:49.756
Story of my life.

435
00:26:52.091 --> 00:26:54.594
So this should take care of it?

436
00:26:54.661 --> 00:26:56.729
Yep, penicillin is great.

437
00:26:56.796 --> 00:26:59.232
Alexander Fleming
discovered it in the '20s.


438
00:26:59.299 --> 00:27:00.633
Good for her.

439
00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.635
He left his lab
a mess over the weekend.


440
00:27:02.702 --> 00:27:05.371
When he got back, a weird fungus
had grown in a petri dish.


441
00:27:05.438 --> 00:27:08.041
From that fungus,
we have penicillin.


442
00:27:08.107 --> 00:27:09.175
Sounds disgusting.

443
00:27:09.242 --> 00:27:11.411
Yeah,
but it's amazing


444
00:27:11.477 --> 00:27:13.846
what you can discover
after life gets fucked up.


445
00:27:48.314 --> 00:27:50.883
Dara?

446
00:27:59.258 --> 00:28:01.594
Are you out back?

447
00:28:05.431 --> 00:28:07.233
You will not believe
the size of the...


448
00:28:10.069 --> 00:28:12.004
- Pull up your pants!
- I'm trying!


449
00:28:12.071 --> 00:28:14.374
- Try harder!
- I'm trying harder!


450
00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.309
Stop yelling at me!

451
00:28:25.084 --> 00:28:28.321
Hi. Do you wanna know the
craziest thing about doors?


452
00:28:28.388 --> 00:28:29.422
You can lock them.

453
00:28:29.489 --> 00:28:30.990
Fuck, man, she's so mad.

454
00:28:31.057 --> 00:28:32.625
If anyone asks, you
didn't see anything.


455
00:28:32.692 --> 00:28:36.329
I am literally trying to unsee
that as we speak.


456
00:28:36.396 --> 00:28:37.897
I thought she didn't
want to eat your quiche.


457
00:28:37.964 --> 00:28:39.999
Oh, remember when
I covered for you?


458
00:28:40.066 --> 00:28:41.968
We got to talking,
and things started to happen,


459
00:28:42.034 --> 00:28:43.503
and it was like...

460
00:28:43.569 --> 00:28:45.438
It is bad enough that I'm
responsible for my own mistakes.


461
00:28:45.505 --> 00:28:48.641
Do not make me responsible
for yours, too.


462
00:28:48.708 --> 00:28:50.176
Caleb?

463
00:28:50.243 --> 00:28:51.577
Uh...

464
00:28:55.248 --> 00:28:57.083
You're not gonna say anything.

465
00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:59.085
You saw nothing.

466
00:28:59.152 --> 00:29:00.820
No, promise me.

467
00:29:00.887 --> 00:29:02.822
Caleb, say it!

468
00:29:02.889 --> 00:29:04.157
Say it!

469
00:29:04.223 --> 00:29:06.092
Promise me!

470
00:29:09.295 --> 00:29:11.264
You rang?

471
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.533
Sit.

472
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:22.642
Um, look, I'm having
such a shitty week, okay?


473
00:29:22.708 --> 00:29:24.510
Henry still hasn't found a job,

474
00:29:24.577 --> 00:29:27.513
I'm doing double duty with
the fucking kids at home.


475
00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.450
My dog got scabies
again at the dog park.


476
00:29:30.516 --> 00:29:32.952
My mother-in-law is visiting.

477
00:29:33.019 --> 00:29:35.354
I...

478
00:29:35.421 --> 00:29:38.057
I'm really not happy.

479
00:29:39.559 --> 00:29:42.628
You looked pretty happy
a couple minutes ago.


480
00:29:42.695 --> 00:29:43.863
- You know what?
- What?


481
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:45.765
- I don't like your tone.
- Mm-hmm.


482
00:29:45.832 --> 00:29:48.367
And I really don't like seeing
security camera footage of you


483
00:29:48.434 --> 00:29:49.836
fucking around
and leaving early.


484
00:29:49.902 --> 00:29:51.337
I'm trying to run a business...

485
00:29:51.404 --> 00:29:53.739
a profitable,
respectable business!


486
00:29:53.806 --> 00:29:55.708
You're right,
this is a mini-mart.


487
00:29:55.775 --> 00:29:58.444
It's very serious. We sell,
what, 10 types of Funyuns


488
00:29:58.511 --> 00:29:59.912
and, like, a pickle in a sack?

489
00:29:59.979 --> 00:30:01.481
You know what,
don't fucking test me!


490
00:30:01.547 --> 00:30:03.883
I could fire you!

491
00:30:05.885 --> 00:30:07.954
Okay, Suzanne,
I can't lose this job.


492
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:09.555
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.


493
00:30:09.622 --> 00:30:10.990
I need the minimum
wage that you pay me.


494
00:30:11.057 --> 00:30:12.291
Really?

495
00:30:12.358 --> 00:30:15.061
Yeah, so, it won't
happen again, I swear.


496
00:30:15.127 --> 00:30:16.295
I'm sorry?

497
00:30:16.362 --> 00:30:19.465
It won't
happen again, I swear.


498
00:30:19.532 --> 00:30:20.766
Fine.

499
00:30:20.833 --> 00:30:22.668
Cool.

500
00:30:22.735 --> 00:30:26.472
Can we also just agree that

501
00:30:26.539 --> 00:30:29.408
what happens in
here stays in here?


502
00:30:29.475 --> 00:30:31.244
Do you mean what happened here
and, like, here,


503
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:32.712
and, like, here?

504
00:30:32.778 --> 00:30:35.081
Yeah, all of
it, and over there, right.


505
00:30:35.147 --> 00:30:36.716
Mm-hmm, yeah, no.

506
00:30:36.782 --> 00:30:38.150
Secret's safe with me.

507
00:30:38.217 --> 00:30:40.820
- You promise?
- Sure.


508
00:30:40.887 --> 00:30:42.755
- Can I leave now?
- Please.


509
00:30:42.822 --> 00:30:44.190
Thanks.

510
00:30:46.158 --> 00:30:47.627
Oh.

511
00:30:47.693 --> 00:30:52.465
You could be a little
nicer to her, you know?


512
00:30:52.532 --> 00:30:55.101
So could you.

513
00:31:00.606 --> 00:31:04.544
You're
off by two cents.


514
00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:06.078
Go.

515
00:31:06.145 --> 00:31:07.947
Just go.

516
00:31:09.682 --> 00:31:11.918
- Well?
- I can't believe you like her.


517
00:31:11.984 --> 00:31:14.287
She's, like, at least
five kinds of evil?


518
00:31:14.353 --> 00:31:15.588
Does she hate me?

519
00:31:15.655 --> 00:31:16.789
Hating you is
statistically possible,


520
00:31:16.856 --> 00:31:18.224
and I have the math to prove it.

521
00:31:18.291 --> 00:31:20.059
Yeah, you failed math. Twice.

522
00:31:20.126 --> 00:31:21.494
This is a different
type of math.


523
00:31:21.561 --> 00:31:23.863
This is gay math.

524
00:31:25.831 --> 00:31:28.301
Oh, some kid came
in looking for you?


525
00:31:28.367 --> 00:31:32.805
He bought kettle corn.
I think he's still outside.


526
00:31:32.872 --> 00:31:35.207
Are you hooking up with him?

527
00:31:35.274 --> 00:31:37.209
Gonna be right back.

528
00:31:48.854 --> 00:31:54.260
You do know that popcorn isn't
the only food group, right?


529
00:32:00.032 --> 00:32:02.401
Jim's having a
cabaret show tomorrow.


530
00:32:02.468 --> 00:32:03.970
Do you wanna go?

531
00:32:04.036 --> 00:32:06.072
It depends.

532
00:32:06.138 --> 00:32:07.707
Are you asking me out?

533
00:32:07.773 --> 00:32:09.842
Depends what you'd say.

534
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:12.912
- Maybe?
- Then maybe.


535
00:32:14.447 --> 00:32:17.717
I don't get off until eight.

536
00:32:17.783 --> 00:32:19.986
Show starts at nine.

537
00:32:20.052 --> 00:32:24.023
- So just pick you up from here?
- I'll meet you there.


538
00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:26.058
Okay, cool.

539
00:32:28.527 --> 00:32:30.630
Is she your friend?

540
00:32:33.733 --> 00:32:36.535
Yeah, she's kind
of my only one.


541
00:32:36.602 --> 00:32:37.937
I figured.

542
00:32:38.004 --> 00:32:39.138
How?

543
00:32:39.205 --> 00:32:41.941
You both say very
strange things.


544
00:33:06.065 --> 00:33:08.034
Do you feel like
closing early tonight?


545
00:33:11.704 --> 00:33:13.172
Dara!

546
00:33:15.174 --> 00:33:16.409
Dara!

547
00:33:24.417 --> 00:33:25.651
Whoa!

548
00:33:25.718 --> 00:33:28.988
Wow, a vicious read.

549
00:33:29.055 --> 00:33:31.424
Make it up to me
with a close party.


550
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:33.759
I'm not feeling
so hot right now.


551
00:33:33.826 --> 00:33:35.561
That sounds like
a perfect excuse


552
00:33:35.628 --> 00:33:38.464
to shut this place down
and get absolutely blasted.


553
00:33:38.531 --> 00:33:41.333
There's only 15 minutes left.
We should at least wait.


554
00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.736

00:35:38.417 --> 00:35:40.352
What's wrong?

583
00:35:40.419 --> 00:35:42.021
Are you gonna vomit too?

584
00:35:42.087 --> 00:35:42.822
Mm-mm.

585
00:35:42.888 --> 00:35:45.724
- Okay.
- Maybe.


586
00:35:49.361 --> 00:35:53.532
You think we'll ever find
other people to do this with?


587
00:35:53.599 --> 00:35:55.601
Why do we need other people?

588
00:35:55.668 --> 00:35:57.336
No, like...

589
00:35:57.403 --> 00:36:02.908
like a boyfriend or a girlfriend
or maybe somebody in-between.


590
00:36:04.376 --> 00:36:07.446
Like, somebody who
wants to do dumb shit


591
00:36:07.513 --> 00:36:10.816
who also wants to make out.

592
00:36:11.717 --> 00:36:14.653
- Oh.
- Mm.


593
00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.355
Yeah.

594
00:36:16.422 --> 00:36:18.290
For sure.

595
00:36:22.361 --> 00:36:24.964
What if that's
harder for me now?


596
00:36:26.866 --> 00:36:30.502
It won't be.

597
00:36:30.569 --> 00:36:34.673
Yeah, but what if it is?

598
00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.675
No.

599
00:36:36.742 --> 00:36:39.144
It won't be.

600
00:36:39.211 --> 00:36:43.315
And until then,
you got me, bitch.


601
00:36:50.623 --> 00:36:53.058
Everything about
my life is uncertain.


602
00:36:53.125 --> 00:36:55.828
I'm totally stressed out
because of my health,


603
00:36:55.895 --> 00:36:58.931
and I'm totally stressed
out because of work,


604
00:36:58.998 --> 00:37:02.801
and I don't know
what I want to do.


605
00:37:02.868 --> 00:37:05.471
Just call me and tell me.

606
00:37:05.537 --> 00:37:08.140
That's the only thing
I've ever asked for.


607
00:37:14.513 --> 00:37:15.514
Hey, Caleb?

608
00:37:15.581 --> 00:37:17.616
Can I run something by you?

609
00:37:17.683 --> 00:37:18.951
Totally.

610
00:37:19.018 --> 00:37:21.553
Okay,
how's this sound?


611
00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:26.525
"When I first started teaching
here back in the late 1800s"...


612
00:37:26.592 --> 00:37:28.427
Pause for laughs.

613
00:37:28.494 --> 00:37:32.464
"The only gender studies
course was worth half a credit


614
00:37:32.531 --> 00:37:36.035
and met in what is now
the woman's bathroom."


615
00:37:36.101 --> 00:37:38.037
Okay, Joan Rivers,

616
00:37:38.103 --> 00:37:41.440
is this a guest lecture
or an HBO special?


617
00:37:42.775 --> 00:37:44.576
Grandma?

618
00:37:44.643 --> 00:37:45.911
You good?

619
00:37:45.978 --> 00:37:49.682
Yeah, yeah, less
Joan Rivers, got it.


620
00:37:49.748 --> 00:37:52.318
Thanks a lot, honey.

621
00:37:59.158 --> 00:38:01.961
Look at
your phone, bitch!


622
00:38:19.244 --> 00:38:20.946
And when a hot redhead
walks down the street,


623
00:38:21.013 --> 00:38:22.648
do you also imagine
God knocking over


624
00:38:22.715 --> 00:38:24.149
a bottle of Sriracha?

625
00:38:26.418 --> 00:38:28.354
Well, I think
it's time for a song.


626
00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.756
This is a special request
from an audience member


627
00:38:30.823 --> 00:38:32.691
in the third row.

628
00:38:32.758 --> 00:38:35.995

632

Can you earn a living
from taking photographs?


633
00:39:10.729 --> 00:39:12.031
Isn't very practical.

634
00:39:12.097 --> 00:39:14.533
Practicality is very 2010.

635
00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.602
I was gonna go to
college in New York,


636
00:39:16.668 --> 00:39:19.605
take a bunch of photos,
overdose on ramen.


637
00:39:19.671 --> 00:39:21.440
How about you?
Where you going next year?


638
00:39:21.507 --> 00:39:22.674
Georgia Tech.

639
00:39:22.741 --> 00:39:23.809
Atlanta.

640
00:39:23.876 --> 00:39:24.843
Fancy.

641
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:26.311
You're excited?

642
00:39:26.378 --> 00:39:30.015
It's hard to think of
anything past this summer.


643
00:39:30.082 --> 00:39:33.819
Do you ever, like,
wonder what you would do


644
00:39:33.886 --> 00:39:36.055
- if the test came back...
- No.


645
00:39:36.121 --> 00:39:38.257
I try not to.

646
00:39:38.323 --> 00:39:41.527
Yeah, uh, me either.

647
00:39:41.593 --> 00:39:43.395
I mean, I know you're
supposed to be fine


648
00:39:43.462 --> 00:39:46.565
if you take all the
shit you're supposed to.


649
00:39:46.632 --> 00:39:50.569
At this point, you'd have worse
luck with cancer, but, like...


650
00:39:50.636 --> 00:39:52.938
Still kinda wish it
was something else.


651
00:39:53.005 --> 00:39:55.174
Like, anything else.

652
00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.042
You'd rather have cancer?

653
00:39:57.109 --> 00:40:00.913
I don't know
about that, but, um...


654
00:40:00.979 --> 00:40:03.949
Yeah, I just... at least then
I wouldn't feel like it was...


655
00:40:04.016 --> 00:40:06.218
Your fault.

656
00:40:10.522 --> 00:40:13.158
Anyways, are you, um...
are you gonna go to sleep


657
00:40:13.225 --> 00:40:17.229
- when you get home, or...
- Am I going home?


658
00:40:19.064 --> 00:40:21.400
Are we gonna get in trouble?

659
00:40:21.467 --> 00:40:25.204
It's always a possibility.

660
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.739
Is this your temple?

661
00:40:27.806 --> 00:40:30.843
Yeah, it used to be.

662
00:40:30.909 --> 00:40:32.544
What happened?

663
00:40:32.611 --> 00:40:36.415
Um, the artist formerly known
as my mother married the rabbi,


664
00:40:36.482 --> 00:40:40.419
and they're assholes,
so I stopped going.


665
00:40:40.486 --> 00:40:42.721
You really shouldn't
talk about her like that.


666
00:40:42.788 --> 00:40:44.223
She's still your mom.

667
00:40:44.289 --> 00:40:45.591
Yeah, but, like,

668
00:40:45.657 --> 00:40:47.459
moms aren't supposed to forget
to pick you up


669
00:40:47.526 --> 00:40:49.495
from band practice right after
your dad died


670
00:40:49.561 --> 00:40:52.331
'cause she's too busy
trying to find a new husband.


671
00:40:52.397 --> 00:40:54.766
Moms aren't supposed
to make you move in


672
00:40:54.833 --> 00:40:57.302
with your grandma because
your big old gay lifestyle


673
00:40:57.369 --> 00:41:00.272
doesn't sit too well
with the rabbi's mezuzah.


674
00:41:00.339 --> 00:41:01.573
Moms aren't supposed
to treat you


675
00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:06.478
like a total and
complete stranger.


676
00:41:12.684 --> 00:41:15.220
What's a mezuzah?

677
00:41:16.388 --> 00:41:17.990
It's like this thing
you nail to your house.


678
00:41:18.056 --> 00:41:19.725
It's got the Bible in it.

679
00:41:19.791 --> 00:41:23.395
Come on, this jungle gym
is gonna blow your mind.


680
00:41:29.501 --> 00:41:33.605
I lost two teeth falling
off of this jungle gym.


681
00:41:33.672 --> 00:41:35.407
Tooth fairy was supposed
to give me 20 bucks.


682
00:41:35.474 --> 00:41:39.945
Instead, I got two carrots
and a pack of Chiclets.


683
00:41:40.012 --> 00:41:43.282
- That's upsetting?
- No, it was pretty funny.


684
00:41:43.348 --> 00:41:47.619
My dad did dumb shit
like that all the time.


685
00:41:47.686 --> 00:41:51.123
Um, I had my first
kiss under this bridge


686
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:53.225
with Jordan Stein.

687
00:41:53.292 --> 00:41:57.829
Jordan smelled like applesauce.
Needless to say, I was smitten.


688
00:41:57.896 --> 00:42:00.866
- What happened to him?
- Jordan was a girl.


689
00:42:00.933 --> 00:42:02.834
I meant your dad.

690
00:42:02.901 --> 00:42:04.303
Oh.

691
00:42:04.369 --> 00:42:07.606
Um, he had a heart attack.

692
00:42:10.409 --> 00:42:13.111
I once peed down this slide.

693
00:42:15.781 --> 00:42:18.350
Okay, I'm lying.
I peed down this slide a lot.


694
00:42:18.417 --> 00:42:20.252
That must've been hard.

695
00:42:20.319 --> 00:42:23.121
No, I've got awesome pee aim.

696
00:42:23.188 --> 00:42:26.625
I was talking about your dad.

697
00:42:26.692 --> 00:42:29.127
I know.

698
00:42:29.194 --> 00:42:34.333
When did he, uh...

699
00:42:34.399 --> 00:42:38.203
We should take cover.
I think it's gonna rain.


700
00:42:48.814 --> 00:42:50.582
I think I'm sitting
on a spider.


701
00:42:50.649 --> 00:42:52.084
It's a playground
rite of passage.


702
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.721
I think you're gonna be fine.

703
00:42:55.787 --> 00:42:57.322
I can't believe
this is outside the place


704
00:42:57.389 --> 00:42:58.690
where you pray.

705
00:42:58.757 --> 00:43:01.727
Yep, there's a
sanctuary in there.


706
00:43:01.793 --> 00:43:04.496
It's also a catering
hall and a preschool.


707
00:43:04.563 --> 00:43:09.401
We're nothing if not
an economical people.


708
00:43:09.468 --> 00:43:12.471
Do you like being Jewish?

709
00:43:12.537 --> 00:43:13.805
It's a loaded question.

710
00:43:13.872 --> 00:43:16.875
Um, leaning toward yes.

711
00:43:16.942 --> 00:43:18.710
There's, like, six
types of Jewish people,


712
00:43:18.777 --> 00:43:23.982
and I wanna say two
are pretty fierce.


713
00:43:24.049 --> 00:43:25.350
Do you like being Hindu?

714
00:43:25.417 --> 00:43:28.920
Who said I was Hindu?

715
00:43:28.987 --> 00:43:30.289
Oh my god, I'm so sorry...

716
00:43:30.355 --> 00:43:32.124
I'm just kidding.

717
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:33.992
I'm Hindu.

718
00:43:54.913 --> 00:43:57.149
I, uh...

719
00:43:57.215 --> 00:43:59.584
It's getting late.

720
00:44:28.313 --> 00:44:30.582
- Where you going?
- Work.


721
00:44:30.649 --> 00:44:32.084
Where you really going?

722
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:34.453
I'm gonna go do some
drugs, graffiti buildings,


723
00:44:34.519 --> 00:44:37.289
- TP the principal's house.
- Caleb.


724
00:44:37.356 --> 00:44:40.058
Benny, could we
not do this now, please?


725
00:44:40.125 --> 00:44:42.928
"The Young and The Sexless?"

726
00:44:42.994 --> 00:44:45.931
- Where did you find that?
- On the floor.


727
00:44:45.997 --> 00:44:48.233
I'm doing a photo project.

728
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:52.604
Gay men in crisis, the pos
community, homeless youth,


729
00:44:52.671 --> 00:44:54.573
those who can't dress
for their body type.


730
00:44:54.639 --> 00:44:58.710
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying.


731
00:44:58.777 --> 00:45:01.913
Are you gonna tell her?
Or am I?


732
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.015
You know, this is actually
none of your business.


733
00:45:04.082 --> 00:45:05.350
Excuse me?

734
00:45:05.417 --> 00:45:06.852
We both know
that you only pretend


735
00:45:06.918 --> 00:45:11.990
to give a shit about me
because you have to... for her.


736
00:45:17.162 --> 00:45:18.730
Do you know me?

737
00:45:21.032 --> 00:45:22.868
Have we met?

738
00:45:22.934 --> 00:45:25.704
Now I've spent the last

739
00:45:25.771 --> 00:45:28.573
taking you out for
sleepovers and band practice


740
00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:32.177
and off the floor
because your daddy died.


741
00:45:32.244 --> 00:45:36.548
I could be buying pina coladas
and the daiquiris,


742
00:45:36.615 --> 00:45:40.719
some loose poker, but I
decided to spend it on you,


743
00:45:40.786 --> 00:45:46.291
because we do belong together.

744
00:45:46.358 --> 00:45:50.429
If you don't tell her, I will,
because you're just a kid.


745
00:45:50.495 --> 00:45:52.964
You shouldn't do this alone.

746
00:46:58.497 --> 00:47:00.365
Caleb?

747
00:47:00.432 --> 00:47:02.400
What's new with you?

748
00:47:05.036 --> 00:47:07.973
Oh, I've been amazing.

749
00:47:08.039 --> 00:47:10.542
Things have been
looking up for me.


750
00:47:10.609 --> 00:47:12.978
Um, my job is awesome.

751
00:47:13.044 --> 00:47:14.746
I had a conversation
with my boss.


752
00:47:14.813 --> 00:47:17.816
We're gonna take things to the
next level professionally.


753
00:47:17.883 --> 00:47:19.784
I'm very excited about that.

754
00:47:19.851 --> 00:47:21.553
Kinda Zen about the whole thing.

755
00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.222
I think it's this new
sleep regiment I'm on.


756
00:47:24.289 --> 00:47:26.658
Also, I've been riding
my bike everywhere,


757
00:47:26.725 --> 00:47:29.761
so I'm like... like
saving the planet


758
00:47:29.828 --> 00:47:33.265
and engaging my core
at the same time.


759
00:47:33.331 --> 00:47:35.534
That's great, Caleb.

760
00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.756
- Did you just get here?
- Unfortunately.


761
00:47:57.822 --> 00:48:00.992
Dude, I called you,
like, twice this morning.


762
00:48:01.059 --> 00:48:03.828
Yeah, I woke up late.
Suzanne here?


763
00:48:03.895 --> 00:48:07.165
No, she's with that penis.

764
00:48:07.232 --> 00:48:08.700
Thank God.

765
00:48:10.101 --> 00:48:11.336
How are you?

766
00:48:11.403 --> 00:48:13.305
Alive.

767
00:48:13.371 --> 00:48:15.607
I get test results tomorrow.

768
00:48:15.674 --> 00:48:19.044
Alright?

769
00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:21.780
Wanna hang?
Help take your mind off of it?


770
00:48:21.846 --> 00:48:22.981
I'm supposed to work,

771
00:48:23.048 --> 00:48:25.050
but it's not like
anyone needs me here.


772
00:48:25.116 --> 00:48:27.152
I'm good, don't worry.

773
00:48:27.218 --> 00:48:28.386
I'm not worried,

774
00:48:28.453 --> 00:48:31.523
I just thought you
might want some company.


775
00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:33.391
I have plans.

776
00:48:33.458 --> 00:48:36.227
With who?

777
00:48:36.294 --> 00:48:37.896
A friend.

778
00:48:40.398 --> 00:48:41.533
What friend?

779
00:48:48.607 --> 00:48:53.712
Wow, this place is
definitely a... choice.


780
00:48:55.547 --> 00:48:57.949
Where is everybody?

781
00:48:58.016 --> 00:49:00.051
We close down
Monday for cleaning.


782
00:49:00.118 --> 00:49:01.419
We?

783
00:49:01.486 --> 00:49:04.289
You're not the
only one with a job.


784
00:49:06.925 --> 00:49:12.263
Everything you see can be
yours for the next 42 minutes.


785
00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:13.999
You're full of surprises.

786
00:49:14.065 --> 00:49:17.135
I thought a little escape
might help you calm down.


787
00:49:17.202 --> 00:49:18.737
Unless the rides
are made of Xanax,


788
00:49:18.803 --> 00:49:21.473
- I don't think that's possible.
- Can you just relax?


789
00:49:21.539 --> 00:49:23.241
For me?

790
00:49:30.415 --> 00:49:31.683
Welcome to the popcorn stand.

791
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:34.853
Would you like it
sweet or salty?


792
00:49:34.919 --> 00:49:36.655
Every single question
I've ever had about you


793
00:49:36.721 --> 00:49:37.922
has just been answered.

794
00:49:37.989 --> 00:49:39.658
They say if
you do what you love,


795
00:49:39.724 --> 00:49:40.992
you never work a
day in your life.


796
00:49:41.059 --> 00:49:42.560
Okay, but
I'm almost positive


797
00:49:42.627 --> 00:49:43.862
they didn't mean popping corn.

798
00:49:43.928 --> 00:49:46.297
That's where you're wrong.
It's the best.


799
00:49:46.364 --> 00:49:47.565
Back home, we used to go to

800
00:49:47.632 --> 00:49:48.967
the American movie
theater on Sundays.


801
00:49:49.034 --> 00:49:50.402
I'd be excited to go all week.

802
00:49:50.468 --> 00:49:52.370
They played the classics like
"Breakfast at Tiffany's"


803
00:49:52.437 --> 00:49:53.972
or "A Star is Born" or...

804
00:49:54.039 --> 00:49:56.141
- Oh, which version?
- There's more than one?


805
00:49:56.207 --> 00:49:57.909
Okay, I'm gonna
pretend you're joking.


806
00:49:57.976 --> 00:49:59.778
It didn't matter what
the movie was anyway.


807
00:49:59.844 --> 00:50:03.314
It just would take
me out of my head.


808
00:50:03.381 --> 00:50:06.918
Anytime I felt depressed,
I'd, uh, go back into my pockets


809
00:50:06.985 --> 00:50:08.820
and take the leftover
popcorn and eat it,


810
00:50:08.887 --> 00:50:12.957
and I was back watching
Holly Golightly and her cat.


811
00:50:13.024 --> 00:50:14.793
Now you can get out of
your head whenever you want,


812
00:50:14.859 --> 00:50:16.861
so maybe try eating a vegetable.

813
00:50:16.928 --> 00:50:22.400
I still like eating it.
It helps me not be...


814
00:50:22.467 --> 00:50:25.003
Sad?

815
00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:26.938
Present.

816
00:50:31.409 --> 00:50:33.144
What next?

817
00:50:37.749 --> 00:50:39.384
Go!

818
00:50:48.493 --> 00:50:50.762
Tom?

819
00:50:50.829 --> 00:50:54.099
Can you operate the
drop for me and my...


820
00:50:54.165 --> 00:50:56.067
me and my cousin?

821
00:51:29.534 --> 00:51:31.402
Where are you going?

822
00:51:31.469 --> 00:51:36.207
It's stuck!
Gotta call maintenance.


823
00:51:39.511 --> 00:51:42.580
Are you all right?

824
00:51:42.647 --> 00:51:43.815
Yeah.

825
00:51:59.164 --> 00:52:00.265
Dara?

826
00:52:00.331 --> 00:52:01.933
Caleb tells me
you're a great cook.


827
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.735
What do you like to make?

828
00:52:03.802 --> 00:52:05.770
Food.

829
00:52:07.672 --> 00:52:11.676
I make food.

830
00:52:11.743 --> 00:52:14.412
Thank God.

831
00:52:14.479 --> 00:52:18.483
- Happy to see me?
- What's the verdict?


832
00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:23.321
Your 30-day antibody
test came back negative.


833
00:52:25.723 --> 00:52:27.826
So far, so good, right?

834
00:52:27.892 --> 00:52:29.127
So far.

835
00:52:29.194 --> 00:52:32.997
I will see you back here
on day 60 and day 90.


836
00:52:33.064 --> 00:52:34.499
Thanks for coming
with me today.


837
00:52:34.566 --> 00:52:36.634
- Duh.
- Sure.


838
00:52:36.701 --> 00:52:40.638
Oh, shit, I never thought
I'd need a third seat.


839
00:52:40.705 --> 00:52:42.040
Let's take the bus.
The bus is cool.


840
00:52:42.106 --> 00:52:44.442
No, it's chill. Um, I told
Suzanne I'd help her out


841
00:52:44.509 --> 00:52:45.710
at the store in an hour.

842
00:52:45.777 --> 00:52:47.579
Ew. You don't work today.

843
00:52:47.645 --> 00:52:51.416
I don't know. She asked
if I wanted overtime, so...


844
00:52:51.482 --> 00:52:54.886
Okay, don't do
anything I wouldn't do,


845
00:52:54.953 --> 00:52:57.522
so don't do anything.

846
00:53:08.466 --> 00:53:10.802
Hey.

847
00:53:12.136 --> 00:53:13.905
Look, Benny, I know
I've been a dick lately,


848
00:53:13.972 --> 00:53:18.176
and I just wanted to
say I'm really sorry.


849
00:53:18.243 --> 00:53:20.411
It's, like, a lot for
me, and I don't know how


850
00:53:20.478 --> 00:53:22.747
I'm gonna tell her, but...

851
00:53:22.814 --> 00:53:26.217
Tell her what?

852
00:53:30.388 --> 00:53:33.725
Well, somebody
better say something.


853
00:53:33.791 --> 00:53:36.060
Somebody, anybody,

854
00:53:36.127 --> 00:53:38.463
before I burn this
house to the ground.


855
00:53:38.529 --> 00:53:40.398
What?

856
00:53:40.465 --> 00:53:41.733
What's going on?

857
00:53:41.799 --> 00:53:44.969
Okay, okay, um...

858
00:53:45.036 --> 00:53:46.537
Lately, I've been going
through this thing.


859
00:53:46.604 --> 00:53:51.209
I met a guy after Don
dumped me and we, you know,


860
00:53:51.276 --> 00:53:55.747
and the condom ripped and
it turns out he has HIV.


861
00:53:55.813 --> 00:53:57.515
But I don't know if I have it.

862
00:53:57.582 --> 00:53:58.983
I don't think I have it.

863
00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:02.453
I might not have it, you know,
and I have to wait until


864
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.957
the end of summer
to find out if I do.


865
00:54:06.024 --> 00:54:09.360
And that's why I've been
kind of a bitch lately.


866
00:54:15.033 --> 00:54:17.535
Can you please say something?

867
00:54:17.602 --> 00:54:20.038
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

868
00:54:20.104 --> 00:54:24.342
I didn't want to freak
you out after everything.


869
00:54:24.409 --> 00:54:26.945
Benny tried to get me
to tell you, but, like,


870
00:54:27.011 --> 00:54:28.913
I couldn't.

871
00:54:34.018 --> 00:54:37.021
You could never
freak me out, Caleb,


872
00:54:37.088 --> 00:54:39.724
although you sure
keep trying to.


873
00:54:39.791 --> 00:54:41.359
Well, it's
just, like, I mean,


874
00:54:41.426 --> 00:54:44.095
telling you just makes
the whole thing feel real,


875
00:54:44.162 --> 00:54:47.398
and I was just totally
hoping it would be imaginary.


876
00:54:47.465 --> 00:54:51.569
The only thing that's
real is this right here,


877
00:54:51.636 --> 00:54:56.441
you and me, no?

878
00:54:56.507 --> 00:54:58.943
Now give me a hug.

879
00:55:07.151 --> 00:55:09.721
Okay, I can't breathe.
Grandma?


880
00:55:09.787 --> 00:55:11.022
If you ever hide

881
00:55:11.089 --> 00:55:13.291
anything like this
from me again,


882
00:55:13.358 --> 00:55:16.127
you won't have to worry
about getting sick


883
00:55:16.194 --> 00:55:18.896
because I will throttle
you with my bare hands,


884
00:55:18.963 --> 00:55:21.899
you understand what
I'm saying to you?


885
00:55:21.966 --> 00:55:24.702
Yes.

886
00:55:24.769 --> 00:55:26.437
Good.

887
00:55:50.661 --> 00:55:53.197
Hey. Everything okay?

888
00:55:53.264 --> 00:55:55.867
Yes. Why are we whispering?

889
00:55:55.933 --> 00:55:57.368
I'm at home.

890
00:55:57.435 --> 00:55:59.704
Oh, okay, cool.

891
00:55:59.771 --> 00:56:01.005
What's up?

892
00:56:01.072 --> 00:56:03.908
Um...

893
00:56:03.975 --> 00:56:05.910
I told her.

894
00:56:05.977 --> 00:56:07.245
Told her what?

895
00:56:07.311 --> 00:56:10.848
My grandma. About everything.

896
00:56:10.915 --> 00:56:12.216
How did it go?

897
00:56:12.283 --> 00:56:14.085
Yeah, I mean,
considering I felt that


898
00:56:14.152 --> 00:56:19.490
the news might kill
her, it was pretty okay.


899
00:56:19.557 --> 00:56:22.060
- You're lucky.
- Am I on speaker?


900
00:56:22.126 --> 00:56:23.795
I can't hear you
over the Kidz Bop.


901
00:56:23.861 --> 00:56:25.530
I said,
okay, that's great.


902
00:56:25.596 --> 00:56:29.367
I, uh... I can't talk now.
I'll see you tonight.


903
00:56:42.513 --> 00:56:44.515
Did you not
want to tell me because


904
00:56:44.582 --> 00:56:47.618
you knew it'd be even harder
for me to sell this place?


905
00:56:47.685 --> 00:56:49.420
I know you're
upset about Caleb.


906
00:56:49.487 --> 00:56:51.656
No, no, I'm not
upset about Caleb!


907
00:56:51.722 --> 00:56:56.060
I'm furious with you,
asshole, for lying to me!


908
00:56:56.127 --> 00:56:58.196
Caleb is fine. He's just...

909
00:56:58.262 --> 00:57:01.165
He's going to be fine.

910
00:57:01.232 --> 00:57:02.633
He's gonna be fine.

911
00:57:04.335 --> 00:57:07.205
He's gonna be fine. He's...

912
00:57:07.271 --> 00:57:09.373
He's gonna be fine.

913
00:57:13.878 --> 00:57:16.614
Caleb? You with us?

914
00:57:21.953 --> 00:57:27.091
Feels like all
I do is worry her.


915
00:57:27.158 --> 00:57:28.593
After my dad died,

916
00:57:28.659 --> 00:57:30.461
she convinced herself that
she's responsible for me,


917
00:57:30.528 --> 00:57:32.597
and she feels guilty
that I ended up here,


918
00:57:32.663 --> 00:57:36.534
which makes me feel even
guiltier than I already did.


919
00:57:38.569 --> 00:57:42.373
Being Jewish is really
hard, basically.


920
00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.308
You did the right thing.

921
00:57:44.375 --> 00:57:47.778
It's good to have someone
to talk to at home.


922
00:57:47.845 --> 00:57:51.749
And, Estha?
How are things going with you?


923
00:57:53.451 --> 00:57:56.053
Um, they've been better.

924
00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:58.789
I, um...

925
00:57:58.856 --> 00:58:01.159
I, um, find out soon,

926
00:58:01.225 --> 00:58:06.864
and every hour feels like a day.
I...


927
00:58:07.965 --> 00:58:12.270
I still don't know what
my dad will do if, uh...


928
00:58:12.336 --> 00:58:15.373
I'm everything to them, the...

929
00:58:15.439 --> 00:58:17.775
perfect son, the one they to
talk to their friends about,


930
00:58:17.842 --> 00:58:19.343
the salutatorian,

931
00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:22.246
the one that they scram out
to lunch every single Sunday.


932
00:58:22.313 --> 00:58:25.383
They love the son
I let them see.


933
00:58:28.019 --> 00:58:32.323
But then there's this
other part of me, right...


934
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:37.161
the part I keep hidden...

935
00:58:37.228 --> 00:58:40.231
and I keep trying so hard
to be perfect because


936
00:58:40.298 --> 00:58:41.899
I think they'd hate
that other part of me.


937
00:58:41.966 --> 00:58:47.605
But if I do end up having this,
I know I'll have to tell them.


938
00:58:52.677 --> 00:58:55.746
I just don't wanna
be here anymore.


939
00:58:55.813 --> 00:58:59.350
I, uh... I'll go back.

940
00:58:59.417 --> 00:59:02.453
I'd even go forward. It's here.

941
00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:05.089
Here is where I'm having an
issue, where I can't even


942
00:59:05.156 --> 00:59:07.625
watch the TV with my parents
without them thinking that


943
00:59:07.692 --> 00:59:12.830
they know it's there, that
they can smell it on me.


944
00:59:12.897 --> 00:59:14.799
Smell what on you?

945
00:59:20.938 --> 00:59:23.641
Shame.

946
00:59:59.377 --> 01:00:01.679
Look at
your phone, bitch!


947
01:00:05.149 --> 01:00:06.217
Hi.

948
01:00:06.284 --> 01:00:07.785
Happy Fourth, fool.

949
01:00:07.852 --> 01:00:09.553
Are we gonna stoned
and watch "Spiders From Mars"


950
01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.188
like last year? 
I can score some

951
01:00:11.255 --> 01:00:12.690
environmentally-friendly
fireworks.


952
01:00:12.757 --> 01:00:15.693
No, I can't, I'm sorry.
There's something I have to do.


953
01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:18.963
- You with that kid again?
- His name is Estha.


954
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:20.998
All right, whatever.

955
01:00:21.065 --> 01:00:23.334
I gotta tell you something
about Suzanne later, though.


956
01:00:23.401 --> 01:00:25.503
Why? What happened?

957
01:00:25.569 --> 01:00:28.005
She said she loved me.

958
01:00:28.072 --> 01:00:29.640
That she fucking loved me.

959
01:00:29.707 --> 01:00:31.342
Sorry, somebody's
gotta make a living


960
01:00:31.409 --> 01:00:34.779
in this family right now!

961
01:00:34.845 --> 01:00:38.049
Yeah, that's why she
asked me to work overtime.


962
01:00:38.115 --> 01:00:39.617
After we hooked up,

963
01:00:39.684 --> 01:00:42.019
she couldn't stop thinking
about me. How sick is that?


964
01:00:42.086 --> 01:00:43.654
Dara, I really
gotta go, I'm sorry.


965
01:00:43.721 --> 01:00:46.390
- I'll call you back later.
- Well...


966
01:00:48.025 --> 01:00:49.727
Are you ready to go?

967
01:00:49.794 --> 01:00:50.961
Where?

968
01:00:56.133 --> 01:00:58.436
So these are the fireworks?

969
01:00:58.502 --> 01:01:01.572
Hey, it's the best I could do.

970
01:01:03.774 --> 01:01:05.076
Ooh!

971
01:01:05.142 --> 01:01:07.912
Big, scary, ooh!

972
01:02:17.415 --> 01:02:20.684
Thanks
for kidnapping me.


973
01:02:20.751 --> 01:02:23.754
I'm a surprisingly
good kidnapper.


974
01:02:23.821 --> 01:02:27.091
Feel like I should be
more alarmed by that.


975
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:36.534
I live so close to
the beach, but I never come.


976
01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.169
Hm, congrats.

977
01:02:38.235 --> 01:02:41.705
You're officially
a true Floridian.


978
01:02:43.641 --> 01:02:47.711
Come on, being from
Florida isn't that bad.


979
01:02:52.383 --> 01:02:55.052
It's gonna be okay, you know.

980
01:02:55.119 --> 01:02:58.422
You know it's not.

981
01:02:58.489 --> 01:03:01.959
You know everything could
change after tomorrow.


982
01:03:04.495 --> 01:03:06.997
Do you know who
Pedro Zamora is?


983
01:03:07.064 --> 01:03:10.100
I don't know any of the
people you talk about.


984
01:03:10.167 --> 01:03:11.702
Right.

985
01:03:11.769 --> 01:03:14.405
Well, basically, there was,
um, this TV show in the '90s


986
01:03:14.472 --> 01:03:16.474
called "The Real
World: San Francisco."


987
01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:17.942
Seven complete strangers

988
01:03:18.008 --> 01:03:20.578
move into a
poorly-decorated brownstone


989
01:03:20.644 --> 01:03:23.214
and annoy the shit
out of each other.


990
01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:26.383
Pedro is one of those people.

991
01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:28.986
He was from here, actually.

992
01:03:29.053 --> 01:03:34.558
He also was openly pos,

993
01:03:34.625 --> 01:03:37.294
which was, like,
brutal at the time.


994
01:03:37.361 --> 01:03:41.198
And no matter how much his
dumb roommate talked shit,


995
01:03:41.265 --> 01:03:46.237
he still managed to be
the smartest, funniest,


996
01:03:46.303 --> 01:03:50.474
finest motherfucker in the room.

997
01:03:50.541 --> 01:03:52.910
Did he make it?

998
01:03:55.946 --> 01:03:58.382
No.

999
01:03:58.449 --> 01:04:01.585
But we will.

1000
01:04:01.652 --> 01:04:03.420
I don't want to live
with something that makes


1001
01:04:03.487 --> 01:04:07.024
everyone in my life leave me.

1002
01:04:08.459 --> 01:04:10.861
I won't leave you.

1003
01:04:51.936 --> 01:04:53.704
Isn't your grandma
gonna hear us?


1004
01:04:53.771 --> 01:04:55.739
What, no, she
can't hear anything.


1005
01:04:55.806 --> 01:05:00.210
Um, we can be quiet,
though, just in case.


1006
01:05:19.263 --> 01:05:20.831
Should I?

1007
01:05:22.066 --> 01:05:25.102
If you feel like
if you want to.


1008
01:05:53.864 --> 01:05:56.567
- Caleb, this is bad.
- What?


1009
01:05:56.634 --> 01:05:57.835
This is fucking awesome.

1010
01:05:57.901 --> 01:06:01.872
Yeah, I know, but,
we can't have sex.


1011
01:06:15.185 --> 01:06:16.820
Define sex.

1012
01:06:30.334 --> 01:06:33.037
- What are you doing?
- Relax.


1013
01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:42.946
Oh, salty.

1014
01:07:00.731 --> 01:07:04.368
Those are gonna be a
bitch to clean tomorrow.


1015
01:07:04.435 --> 01:07:06.570
Caleb.

1016
01:07:06.637 --> 01:07:09.106
What are gonna do about this?

1017
01:07:09.173 --> 01:07:10.674
What?

1018
01:07:12.042 --> 01:07:14.111
This.

1019
01:07:20.451 --> 01:07:22.052
Um...

1020
01:07:33.097 --> 01:07:36.066
I feel like
he's watching us.


1021
01:07:36.133 --> 01:07:37.367
He is.

1022
01:07:37.434 --> 01:07:42.706
But it's nothing he
hasn't seen before.


1023
01:07:42.773 --> 01:07:46.877
Your parents gonna
wonder where you are?


1024
01:07:46.944 --> 01:07:49.980
I don't care anymore.

1025
01:07:50.047 --> 01:07:52.349
I'll come with you
tomorrow if you want.


1026
01:07:52.416 --> 01:07:54.651
I'm pretty good company.

1027
01:07:54.718 --> 01:07:58.322
By that I mean I
will bring drugs.


1028
01:08:00.891 --> 01:08:03.293
I'd rather go alone.

1029
01:08:05.629 --> 01:08:08.999
Just don't know
what I'll do if...


1030
01:08:09.066 --> 01:08:12.970
You'll take the medication,
and you'll be fine.


1031
01:08:15.472 --> 01:08:17.841
I don't think I'll make it.

1032
01:08:19.843 --> 01:08:24.548
I think I'd just
rather not be here.


1033
01:08:24.615 --> 01:08:25.949
Don't say shit like that.

1034
01:08:26.016 --> 01:08:27.684
It's not something
you joke about.


1035
01:08:27.751 --> 01:08:30.988
Oh, you're one to talk.

1036
01:08:32.756 --> 01:08:37.161
Have you ever lost anyone?

1037
01:08:37.227 --> 01:08:39.229
No.

1038
01:08:39.296 --> 01:08:41.965
Okay, well, with
all due respect,


1039
01:08:42.032 --> 01:08:46.837
you have no idea what it's like.

1040
01:08:46.904 --> 01:08:50.607
Death is not, like, some
freedom from sadness


1041
01:08:50.674 --> 01:08:55.879
or your parents or AIDS.

1042
01:08:58.449 --> 01:09:01.251
It's no more bike rides,
it's no more movie nights,


1043
01:09:01.318 --> 01:09:04.087
it's no more board games.
It's...


1044
01:09:06.857 --> 01:09:09.326
It's just nothing.

1045
01:09:13.096 --> 01:09:16.733
Don't leave the people
who love you with nothing.


1046
01:09:20.137 --> 01:09:23.774
If you love me, you
won't love me anymore.


1047
01:09:26.476 --> 01:09:30.113
I'll ask you not
to speak for me. Thanks.


1048
01:10:44.454 --> 01:10:46.957
Where's Suzanne?

1049
01:10:48.892 --> 01:10:50.160
She left.

1050
01:10:50.227 --> 01:10:52.462
Yeah, something about
a dog having worms,


1051
01:10:52.529 --> 01:10:55.732
or worms having a dog, I don't
know. It sounded really gross.


1052
01:10:55.799 --> 01:10:57.401
Where is she?

1053
01:10:57.467 --> 01:11:02.306
Hm, I just told you, sir, she
left. I mean, She's no longer...


1054
01:11:02.372 --> 01:11:04.041
...here.

1055
01:11:04.107 --> 01:11:06.843
Oh, oops, my bad!

1056
01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:08.712
Um, that's for
employees only back there.


1057
01:11:12.115 --> 01:11:14.251
- Move.
- No.


1058
01:11:14.318 --> 01:11:17.321
- Move.
- No!


1059
01:11:17.387 --> 01:11:19.656
- Harry!
- What the fuck, Suzanne?


1060
01:11:19.723 --> 01:11:21.158
Look, Harry, it's
not... just please calm down.


1061
01:11:21.224 --> 01:11:23.427
It's not what you think.
She was helping me...


1062
01:11:23.493 --> 01:11:25.629
Helping you what?
Find your tits?


1063
01:11:25.696 --> 01:11:28.532
Yeah, I was helping her find
my tits! No, I, we were...


1064
01:11:28.598 --> 01:11:30.133
- She's a kid!
- She's not a kid!


1065
01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:32.402
- Actually, I'm 18.
- She's 18!


1066
01:11:32.469 --> 01:11:33.537
She's not a kid!

1067
01:11:33.603 --> 01:11:35.072
What am I
gonna tell Riley?


1068
01:11:35.138 --> 01:11:37.441
Riley? Why do you
have to tell Riley anything?


1069
01:11:37.507 --> 01:11:40.444
This is between you and me!
This is nothing!


1070
01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:42.045
Okay, it's nothing.

1071
01:11:42.112 --> 01:11:47.684
It's really just a stupid, big
fat nothing! There's nothing.


1072
01:11:47.751 --> 01:11:50.754
Ah, uh, we're...

1073
01:11:50.821 --> 01:11:52.656
We're done.

1074
01:11:54.591 --> 01:11:56.259
Henry.

1075
01:11:58.595 --> 01:12:00.364
I'm sorry, I...

1076
01:12:01.832 --> 01:12:04.501
Henry!

1077
01:12:06.703 --> 01:12:09.006
Come back!

1078
01:12:10.507 --> 01:12:12.576
Hoo!

1079
01:12:12.642 --> 01:12:15.278
That was fucking crazy.

1080
01:12:15.345 --> 01:12:16.913
Yeah.

1081
01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:18.915
She left.

1082
01:12:18.982 --> 01:12:20.183
Can't believe she left.

1083
01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:21.651
Dude, her
fucking husband


1084
01:12:21.718 --> 01:12:24.287
just almost Scott Petersoned me.
Are you okay?


1085
01:12:24.354 --> 01:12:27.391
Oh, so now you give
a shit about my life?


1086
01:12:27.457 --> 01:12:30.894
Because it's suddenly
dramatic enough for you?


1087
01:12:30.961 --> 01:12:32.295
What the fuck is your problem?

1088
01:12:32.362 --> 01:12:33.997
- My problem?
- Yeah.


1089
01:12:34.064 --> 01:12:36.566
Caleb, what the
hell is your problem?


1090
01:12:36.633 --> 01:12:39.936
Banging weird dudes and
ditching me for that loser?


1091
01:12:40.003 --> 01:12:42.239
Okay, Dara?
Take a second,


1092
01:12:42.305 --> 01:12:44.674
and can you stop, like,
pretending to understand


1093
01:12:44.741 --> 01:12:50.147
the shitstorm that's become
my life, because you don't.


1094
01:12:50.213 --> 01:12:53.617
But I wanted to, Caleb.

1095
01:12:53.683 --> 01:12:55.886
But you don't give a shit.

1096
01:12:55.952 --> 01:13:00.357
So, I'm done.

1097
01:13:01.858 --> 01:13:06.096
Yeah, if you want to be sick
with someone else, fine.


1098
01:13:06.163 --> 01:13:08.698
Go be sick with someone else.

1099
01:14:12.662 --> 01:14:15.599
Negative again.

1100
01:14:15.665 --> 01:14:17.467
Oh, fuck.

1101
01:14:19.269 --> 01:14:22.539
Can that just be it?

1102
01:14:22.606 --> 01:14:24.441
Like, do I really have
to wait another month?


1103
01:14:24.508 --> 01:14:26.877
I'm telling you,
you're going to be okay.


1104
01:14:49.266 --> 01:14:50.500
Hey, this is Taylor,

1105
01:14:50.567 --> 01:14:52.402
calling you for the
five millionth time


1106
01:14:52.469 --> 01:14:54.371
to let you know that I've
written a song about you.


1107
01:14:54.437 --> 01:14:58.375
It's called "Pick up
the phone, bitch."


1108
01:14:58.441 --> 01:15:01.411
Hey. I just wanna know...

1109
01:15:01.478 --> 01:15:02.913
This mailbox is full

1110
01:15:02.979 --> 01:15:08.285
and cannot accept any messages
at this time. Good-bye.


1111
01:15:39.349 --> 01:15:41.451
Um, I'm gonna
head out for a bit.


1112
01:15:41.518 --> 01:15:44.287
Oh, you know, Benny's
gonna be out late tonight.


1113
01:15:44.354 --> 01:15:45.655
He's playing poker.

1114
01:15:45.722 --> 01:15:47.357
I thought it would
be a good time for us


1115
01:15:47.424 --> 01:15:49.326
to put your portfolio together.

1116
01:15:49.392 --> 01:15:50.927
Yeah, I'm not doing
the portfolio any more.


1117
01:15:50.994 --> 01:15:52.229
Why not?

1118
01:15:52.295 --> 01:15:55.198
Because I don't
want to, because I suck.


1119
01:15:55.265 --> 01:15:56.766
Also, I don't think
I wanna go anymore.


1120
01:15:56.833 --> 01:16:00.503
Oh, wait just a minute here.
Stay right there.


1121
01:16:00.570 --> 01:16:02.806
Now this is your dream school.
You're going.


1122
01:16:02.872 --> 01:16:04.674
I'm not going.

1123
01:16:04.741 --> 01:16:07.077
Oh, I'm not
gonna let you do this.


1124
01:16:07.143 --> 01:16:11.715
I'm not gonna let you throw
away everything you worked for!


1125
01:16:11.781 --> 01:16:14.217
Okay, just because
you couldn't save Dad


1126
01:16:14.284 --> 01:16:16.319
doesn't mean you have
to try and save me.


1127
01:16:16.386 --> 01:16:17.921
That's not fair.

1128
01:16:17.988 --> 01:16:21.124
I know we're not allowed to
talk about him, but that's true.


1129
01:16:21.191 --> 01:16:22.993
Have you
thought at all about


1130
01:16:23.059 --> 01:16:26.630
what this is like for me,
who's responsible for you?


1131
01:16:26.696 --> 01:16:30.967
I can't talk about your
father because it'd kill me.


1132
01:16:31.034 --> 01:16:35.772
And then who would be
here to take care of you?


1133
01:16:35.839 --> 01:16:39.442
I'm sorry you
got stuck with me.


1134
01:16:39.509 --> 01:16:41.011
Consider yourself free, okay?

1135
01:16:41.077 --> 01:16:42.412
Caleb!

1136
01:17:25.955 --> 01:17:27.157
You need to leave.

1137
01:17:27.223 --> 01:17:29.626
Oh, it's good to
see you too, you fuck!


1138
01:17:29.693 --> 01:17:31.628
- Open the window.
- I can't talk right now.


1139
01:17:31.695 --> 01:17:36.266
Open the window, or I'll
scream my fucking face off.


1140
01:17:48.044 --> 01:17:49.679
You're alive. That's cool.

1141
01:17:49.746 --> 01:17:53.583
Um, where the hell
have you been?


1142
01:17:53.650 --> 01:17:56.653
Didn't return any
of my calls, and...


1143
01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:59.489
I told you I was gonna
be there no matter what.


1144
01:17:59.556 --> 01:18:03.827
Negative, positive,
I don't care.


1145
01:18:03.893 --> 01:18:06.296
You should leave.

1146
01:18:06.363 --> 01:18:08.565
What? I'll be quiet.

1147
01:18:08.631 --> 01:18:12.102
Your parents, they won't
even know I'm here.


1148
01:18:12.168 --> 01:18:14.704
Caleb?

1149
01:18:14.771 --> 01:18:18.842
Okay, I don't care
if you're positive.


1150
01:18:18.908 --> 01:18:20.844
I'm not positive.

1151
01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:24.080
You're not positive?

1152
01:18:24.147 --> 01:18:26.349
That's fucking amazing news!

1153
01:18:26.416 --> 01:18:27.984
You're not positive?

1154
01:18:28.051 --> 01:18:33.423
We gotta go party!
We gotta get fucking wasted!


1155
01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:35.759
Caleb, you should go.

1156
01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.562
What's going on?

1157
01:18:42.165 --> 01:18:44.300
Listen.

1158
01:18:44.367 --> 01:18:47.170
You've been a good
friend to me this summer.


1159
01:18:47.237 --> 01:18:48.638
Good friend?

1160
01:18:48.705 --> 01:18:53.042
But, uh, now I have to
focus on the fall and school,


1161
01:18:53.109 --> 01:18:58.314
and, uh, this thing will
have to be behind me.


1162
01:18:58.381 --> 01:19:00.316
This thing?

1163
01:19:01.785 --> 01:19:04.354
This thing?

1164
01:19:08.191 --> 01:19:11.761
So, wait, you didn't
try to kill yourself?


1165
01:19:11.828 --> 01:19:15.498
You're just, like... you're
just, like, ignoring me.


1166
01:19:16.733 --> 01:19:19.636
Why is that so much worse?

1167
01:19:22.605 --> 01:19:25.175
Is it 'cause you're fine?

1168
01:19:25.241 --> 01:19:27.777
And maybe I'm not fine?

1169
01:19:29.045 --> 01:19:30.747
Caleb.

1170
01:19:33.583 --> 01:19:35.485
I'm just a
distraction for you.


1171
01:19:35.552 --> 01:19:39.255
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.


1172
01:19:39.322 --> 01:19:42.425
Just like a nice
way to pass the time


1173
01:19:42.492 --> 01:19:44.394
until you go to
your perfect college


1174
01:19:44.461 --> 01:19:47.664
with your perfect friends and
your perfect fucking future...


1175
01:19:47.730 --> 01:19:50.500
Caleb. Can't stay
in the summer forever.


1176
01:19:50.567 --> 01:19:52.302
I can't, okay? I'm sorry.

1177
01:19:52.368 --> 01:19:53.870
Estha! What is going on
in there?


1178
01:19:53.937 --> 01:19:58.107
Just watching a movie!
Go.


1179
01:19:58.174 --> 01:20:02.779
Oh, and fuck you for
making me like Taylor Swift.


1180
01:20:47.557 --> 01:20:49.759
Hi.

1181
01:20:53.062 --> 01:20:56.199
So, how are you?

1182
01:20:56.266 --> 01:20:59.302
Good.

1183
01:20:59.369 --> 01:21:01.004
How's your grandmother?

1184
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:03.106
She's still alive.

1185
01:21:03.172 --> 01:21:04.574
Yeah, you could call her.

1186
01:21:04.641 --> 01:21:07.243
Yeah, I've been busy.

1187
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:09.012
With, um...

1188
01:21:09.078 --> 01:21:11.014
Beth El's Sisterhood.

1189
01:21:14.884 --> 01:21:16.452
You want something to drink?

1190
01:21:16.519 --> 01:21:18.655
Yes, please.

1191
01:21:39.542 --> 01:21:42.145
You used to like those.

1192
01:21:46.883 --> 01:21:50.520
- Hey, where's Aaron?
- He's working late.


1193
01:21:50.587 --> 01:21:52.655
You look terrible.

1194
01:21:52.722 --> 01:21:53.890
Thank you.

1195
01:21:53.957 --> 01:21:55.758
Want me to give
you a ride back home?


1196
01:21:55.825 --> 01:21:56.793
I mean, sorry, to
your grandmother's?


1197
01:21:56.859 --> 01:21:59.228
The house is different.

1198
01:21:59.295 --> 01:22:01.531
I did some redecorating.

1199
01:22:03.499 --> 01:22:05.602
It's very cool.

1200
01:22:14.644 --> 01:22:17.146
Where'd you put his stuff?

1201
01:22:38.167 --> 01:22:40.603
Can I have this?

1202
01:22:42.105 --> 01:22:45.041
Yeah, sure.

1203
01:23:01.124 --> 01:23:04.027
I ride his bike.

1204
01:23:04.093 --> 01:23:06.129
I know.

1205
01:23:10.333 --> 01:23:13.503
Come on, it's time to go.

1206
01:23:20.276 --> 01:23:23.346
Hey, it's okay.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.


1207
01:23:23.413 --> 01:23:25.014
It's okay.

1208
01:23:25.081 --> 01:23:29.686
It's okay, Seth. It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.


1209
01:23:32.388 --> 01:23:34.957
Can I hold him?

1210
01:23:35.024 --> 01:23:37.226
I'll be careful, I promise.

1211
01:23:37.293 --> 01:23:38.761
Please?

1212
01:23:40.296 --> 01:23:41.798
Please?

1213
01:23:41.864 --> 01:23:44.901
All right, sit down.
Sit down first.


1214
01:23:48.471 --> 01:23:50.406
Be careful.

1215
01:23:50.473 --> 01:23:52.909
You have to hold his head.

1216
01:23:55.478 --> 01:23:57.780
- You got him?
- Mm-hmm.


1217
01:24:05.021 --> 01:24:07.056
Think he likes you.

1218
01:24:08.257 --> 01:24:10.126
Hey, little guy.

1219
01:24:10.193 --> 01:24:14.664
Your fingers look
like baby shrimp.


1220
01:24:14.731 --> 01:24:17.033
Definitely not kosher.

1221
01:24:27.176 --> 01:24:28.878
Hey, Mom?

1222
01:24:32.014 --> 01:24:33.282
I'm not doing good.

1223
01:24:33.349 --> 01:24:37.653
No, you're doing fine.
He's not fussing.


1224
01:24:39.622 --> 01:24:44.694
No, like, I'm... not
doing very good.


1225
01:24:45.561 --> 01:24:47.430
What do you mean?

1226
01:24:47.497 --> 01:24:49.632
What's wrong?

1227
01:24:49.699 --> 01:24:54.937
Okay, so... I got dumped,

1228
01:24:55.004 --> 01:24:59.642
and I've been working
really hard at school...


1229
01:24:59.709 --> 01:25:01.811
- I know.
- And...


1230
01:25:01.878 --> 01:25:07.650
I did something stupid because
I've been sad.


1231
01:25:07.717 --> 01:25:11.487
He was a complete stranger,
and I kinda liked that.


1232
01:25:11.554 --> 01:25:13.189
Like, I kinda...

1233
01:25:13.256 --> 01:25:18.961
I liked that he didn't know me,
and I was really, really drunk.


1234
01:25:20.596 --> 01:25:23.733
And I guess the condom
was old or something.


1235
01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:29.372
Give him to me.

1236
01:25:29.438 --> 01:25:31.174
No, Mom.

1237
01:25:33.543 --> 01:25:35.878
Please.

1238
01:25:35.945 --> 01:25:39.649
You need to go.
You need to go now.


1239
01:25:54.864 --> 01:25:57.834
Mom, please,
don't make me leave.


1240
01:26:50.753 --> 01:26:52.121
Fuck!

1241
01:26:52.188 --> 01:26:56.292
Fucking, fucking,
fucking, fucking, fuck!


1242
01:27:06.102 --> 01:27:08.337
Are you okay?

1243
01:27:56.319 --> 01:27:58.354
Caleb?

1244
01:27:58.421 --> 01:28:00.756
Oh, god.

1245
01:28:00.823 --> 01:28:03.526
What happened?

1246
01:28:03.592 --> 01:28:06.429
Everyone leaves me.

1247
01:28:06.495 --> 01:28:08.698
- That's not true.
- It is.


1248
01:28:08.764 --> 01:28:14.403
Dom, Estha, Dad, her.

1249
01:28:16.272 --> 01:28:17.707
Everyone.

1250
01:28:17.773 --> 01:28:19.575
I don't know what an Estha is,

1251
01:28:19.642 --> 01:28:22.945
but your dad did not
want to leave you, Caleb.


1252
01:28:23.012 --> 01:28:24.580
That's only
'cause he didn't know


1253
01:28:24.647 --> 01:28:27.616
this version of me, the one
with the fucked-up blood.


1254
01:28:27.683 --> 01:28:31.087
Oh, your father
would've gone to war for you.


1255
01:28:31.153 --> 01:28:33.122
He always knew
exactly what you were,


1256
01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:34.991
and he loved you for it.

1257
01:28:35.057 --> 01:28:38.527
Oh, I hate myself for not
reminding you of that


1258
01:28:38.594 --> 01:28:41.097
every single day,

1259
01:28:41.163 --> 01:28:43.933
and it's just so hard
for me to talk about him.


1260
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.569
Yeah, and I don't want
to make things harder for you.


1261
01:28:46.635 --> 01:28:48.070
I'm not gonna hold you back.

1262
01:28:48.137 --> 01:28:50.806
- You're not holding me back.
- I am.


1263
01:28:50.873 --> 01:28:54.477
From selling the
house, from moving.


1264
01:28:54.543 --> 01:28:59.382
Oh, listen, I don't wanna
sell this house because...


1265
01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:05.721
your father had his first
haircut in that bathroom.


1266
01:29:05.788 --> 01:29:10.659
He learned to play the
guitar in that chair.


1267
01:29:10.726 --> 01:29:15.131
And I just don't know
how to let him go.


1268
01:29:15.197 --> 01:29:18.234
It's got nothing to do with you.

1269
01:29:23.105 --> 01:29:26.008
You're gonna have
a wonderful life,


1270
01:29:26.075 --> 01:29:28.811
no matter what that test says,

1271
01:29:28.878 --> 01:29:31.914
and I can't wait to see it.

1272
01:29:31.981 --> 01:29:34.383
Yeah, how do you know?

1273
01:29:34.450 --> 01:29:40.289
I have lived through
two husbands, seven wars...


1274
01:29:41.157 --> 01:29:45.061
and five revivals of "Oklahoma!"

1275
01:29:45.127 --> 01:29:47.496
I've seen it all.

1276
01:29:47.563 --> 01:29:50.766
And, baby, you are
one in a billion.


1277
01:29:50.833 --> 01:29:53.869
You're my grandson.

1278
01:29:53.936 --> 01:29:58.240
You got my blood in you too,
and don't you ever forget it.


1279
01:29:58.307 --> 01:30:04.146
For that reason alone,
you will do great things.


1280
01:30:04.213 --> 01:30:06.916
You will find great love.

1281
01:30:06.982 --> 01:30:10.352
And if you're anything like me,
you'll find it more than once.


1282
01:30:10.419 --> 01:30:13.022
When?

1283
01:30:13.089 --> 01:30:15.324
I'm so tired of waiting.

1284
01:30:15.391 --> 01:30:19.962
I know, honey, but...

1285
01:30:20.029 --> 01:30:22.364
waiting doesn't
mean you shut down.


1286
01:30:22.431 --> 01:30:25.301
It doesn't mean you turn
yourself into the kind of person


1287
01:30:25.367 --> 01:30:28.070
that lets the world
decide who you are


1288
01:30:28.137 --> 01:30:30.873
and what you can do.

1289
01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:33.776
You fight for what you want.

1290
01:30:33.843 --> 01:30:36.212
You fight for what you deserve.

1291
01:30:36.278 --> 01:30:38.747
I mean, you wait,

1292
01:30:38.814 --> 01:30:44.019
but you wait with you
fucking fist in the air.


1293
01:30:53.062 --> 01:30:55.431
That's my boy.

1294
01:32:07.369 --> 01:32:10.940
I'm not really
sure how I'm feeling,


1295
01:32:11.006 --> 01:32:12.875
and I think that's okay.

1296
01:32:12.942 --> 01:32:16.779
Um, at this point, I'm
just, like, ready to know


1297
01:32:16.845 --> 01:32:20.449
and move on with my life.

1298
01:32:20.516 --> 01:32:24.587
And I knew that I
was gonna be in love in him,


1299
01:32:24.653 --> 01:32:26.355
that I was gonna fall
in love with him.


1300
01:32:26.422 --> 01:32:28.591
It is a lot easier for
me to face my own fears


1301
01:32:28.657 --> 01:32:32.361
and face the uncertainty
of my own life


1302
01:32:32.428 --> 01:32:35.264
knowing that he's there.

1303
01:32:35.331 --> 01:32:38.033
So I love you.

1304
01:32:59.922 --> 01:33:03.492
Hey, sorry, um...

1305
01:33:03.559 --> 01:33:06.462
I know things are
kind of weird, but...


1306
01:33:07.963 --> 01:33:09.164
Can I see you?

1307
01:33:19.708 --> 01:33:25.047
Estha! You're going
to miss your flight. Let's go!


1308
01:33:33.756 --> 01:33:35.057
All we ever
talked about


1309
01:33:35.124 --> 01:33:37.393
was getting out
of this shithole!


1310
01:33:37.459 --> 01:33:40.763
Kinda surprised you
asked to meet me here.


1311
01:33:40.829 --> 01:33:44.833
Well, it's so much more
tolerable when nobody's around.


1312
01:33:46.235 --> 01:33:48.437
I got you something.

1313
01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:08.390
Is this quiche?

1314
01:34:08.457 --> 01:34:10.225
I hope so.

1315
01:34:12.361 --> 01:34:14.129
Is it good?

1316
01:34:14.196 --> 01:34:16.398
No!

1317
01:34:27.109 --> 01:34:29.578
Dara.

1318
01:34:29.645 --> 01:34:32.448
I'm really fucking sorry.

1319
01:34:32.514 --> 01:34:36.018
You're my best friend
and I fucked up.


1320
01:34:36.085 --> 01:34:38.287
I'm really sorry, too.

1321
01:34:38.354 --> 01:34:40.289
I quit right after it happened.

1322
01:34:40.356 --> 01:34:42.491
Good for you.

1323
01:34:42.558 --> 01:34:44.560
She had a loose pussy, anyway.

1324
01:34:44.626 --> 01:34:46.595
Thank you for that.

1325
01:34:48.497 --> 01:34:50.766
- I finally got a line cook job!
- That's amazing!


1326
01:34:50.833 --> 01:34:53.335
- At Applebee's.
- Less amazing.


1327
01:34:53.402 --> 01:34:57.573
- But you gotta start somewhere.
- I guess.


1328
01:34:57.639 --> 01:35:01.944
I leave for New York
in, like, like a week.


1329
01:35:02.010 --> 01:35:03.345
Have you packed already?

1330
01:35:03.412 --> 01:35:06.448
Do I really need
to answer that question?


1331
01:35:09.318 --> 01:35:13.355
So I get my final
results tomorrow,


1332
01:35:13.422 --> 01:35:17.793
and I wanted to see if
you wanna come with?


1333
01:35:19.361 --> 01:35:21.797
Yeah, sure, um.

1334
01:35:21.864 --> 01:35:24.032
I'll roll some Js for the road.

1335
01:35:24.099 --> 01:35:28.036
I don't know how you always
know what to say. It's crazy.


1336
01:35:30.906 --> 01:35:33.842
You're not gonna
make me eat one.


1337
01:35:35.310 --> 01:35:37.146
Gross!

1338
01:35:37.212 --> 01:35:38.514
How did I create that?

1339
01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:56.265
So, I scheduled a
walk-through at that condo


1340
01:35:56.331 --> 01:35:59.935
on Hollywood Beach, the Orion.

1341
01:36:01.703 --> 01:36:04.139
Now, before you
get all cute on me,


1342
01:36:04.206 --> 01:36:05.908
I have certain conditions.

1343
01:36:05.974 --> 01:36:08.811
- Naturally.
- I live above the 10th floor.


1344
01:36:08.877 --> 01:36:09.978
Mm-hmm.

1345
01:36:10.045 --> 01:36:11.580
I will have
an oceanfront view.


1346
01:36:11.647 --> 01:36:13.115
- Mm!
- Oh!


1347
01:36:13.182 --> 01:36:15.717
And I will not eat in that
deli more than once a week.


1348
01:36:15.784 --> 01:36:17.019
- Done.
- Do you think


1349
01:36:17.085 --> 01:36:20.189
the resident discount
is transferable?


1350
01:36:20.255 --> 01:36:22.024
Not transferable.

1351
01:36:22.090 --> 01:36:25.627
Orion! Wow.

1352
01:36:28.330 --> 01:36:32.301
How you feeling
about tomorrow?


1353
01:36:32.367 --> 01:36:33.836
Try not to think about it.

1354
01:36:33.902 --> 01:36:35.804
You're doing well
'cause you do a lot of things,


1355
01:36:35.871 --> 01:36:39.808
but you don't think about it.

1356
01:36:39.875 --> 01:36:42.110
- What? He's funny!
- Not that funny.


1357
01:36:42.177 --> 01:36:45.047
He's jealous,
'cause you're not funny.


1358
01:38:24.379 --> 01:38:25.581
Cohn, Caleb?

1359
01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:54.343
Oh, um, I saw
a flier at the center


1360
01:38:54.409 --> 01:38:57.546
for a lesbian craft
night tonight. You wanna...


1361
01:38:57.613 --> 01:38:59.114
You wanna go?

1362
01:38:59.181 --> 01:39:01.783
Okay, but there
won't be boys there.


1363
01:39:01.850 --> 01:39:05.487
Yeah, from this
moment, truly a blessing.


1364
01:39:05.554 --> 01:39:07.022
Um, sure, yeah.

1365
01:39:07.089 --> 01:39:10.759
But only if you really feel up
to it. No pressure.


1366
01:39:10.826 --> 01:39:13.261
No, I know, we can finally
bag you a single lady.


1367
01:39:13.328 --> 01:39:17.332
I heard the craft night is
packed with eligible bottoms.


1368
01:39:17.399 --> 01:39:19.568
Aren't I a bottom?

1369
01:39:19.635 --> 01:39:21.870
You're a top.

1370
01:39:21.937 --> 01:39:23.472
Yeah.

1371
01:43:58.518 --> 01:44:03.518
