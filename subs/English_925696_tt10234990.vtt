1
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.998
- Well?
- It's astounding.


2
00:00:26.032 --> 00:00:27.432
A near perfect match.

3
00:00:27.934 --> 00:00:29.534
Are you sure?

4
00:00:29.568 --> 00:00:31.470
According
to this thermal ion proton


5
00:00:31.503 --> 00:00:34.874
DNA RNA sequencer,
this semen sample definitely


6
00:00:34.907 --> 00:00:36.675
is a descendant of Secretariat,

7
00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:39.411
the greatest
racehorse of all time.


8
00:00:39.444 --> 00:00:40.512
Excellent.

9
00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.252
- Excellent.
- Congratulations, your honour.


10
00:00:47.887 --> 00:00:49.421
Why do you keep
calling me that?


11
00:00:50.957 --> 00:00:53.059
He said that you are a judge.

12
00:00:53.092 --> 00:00:56.661
Not a judge, you nitwit.
The Judge.


13
00:00:56.695 --> 00:00:58.064
The say what now?

14
00:00:58.097 --> 00:01:00.066
I'm Ozzy Judginsky,
the judge.


15
00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:01.700
You know, the singer?

16
00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:03.535
The one that pissed
on the Alamo in Texas?


17
00:01:03.568 --> 00:01:06.638
What? No, that's Ozzy Osbourne.
That's the other Ozzy.


18
00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:08.941
I'm from the 90's band,
Alien Heart Attack?


19
00:01:08.975 --> 00:01:14.579
Oh, right, of course.
That's amazing. Big fan.


20
00:01:14.613 --> 00:01:17.049
- Huge fan.
- Name one Alien Heart Attack


21
00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:19.484
song, and you can't say
Fudge Cloud because that's


22
00:01:19.518 --> 00:01:21.353
the one everybody knows.

23
00:01:21.386 --> 00:01:24.090
Hey, sorry, top 40 kinda gal.
Gotta go with Fudge Clown.


24
00:01:24.123 --> 00:01:26.625
Fudge Cloud, not clown. Jesus.

25
00:01:26.658 --> 00:01:28.627
It's not about
a gay circus performer.


26
00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:33.833
Anyway, congratulations
on the amazing horse semen.


27
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:36.535
Thank you. You do know
what this means, don't you?


28
00:01:37.036 --> 00:01:38.805
Yes, indeed, it means Bens

29
00:01:38.838 --> 00:01:41.073
and I didn't waste our
evening jerking off a donkey.


30
00:01:41.107 --> 00:01:42.975
I told you not to hire them.

31
00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.545
Those two idiots are the worst
muscle men in the business.


32
00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:48.114
Seriously,
who hires a bodyguard


33
00:01:48.147 --> 00:01:49.581
with
a crippling lisp?


34
00:01:49.614 --> 00:01:50.983
Hey, hey, hey.

35
00:01:51.316 --> 00:01:54.352
Now, a speech impediment
can make a man grow tough.


36
00:01:54.386 --> 00:01:57.389
I've known Bobby Q since
before the Earth was flat,


37
00:01:57.422 --> 00:01:59.658
and he makes up for
that lisp in other departments.


38
00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:00.993
Punch a hole
through that wall, Bobby.


39
00:02:01.027 --> 00:02:03.863
Aw, shit.

40
00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.399
Okay, there's no hole, but he
punched without question.


41
00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:09.534
Your Bens is loyal to you?

42
00:02:09.568 --> 00:02:12.404
Well, they yanked off that
pony without any complaints.


43
00:02:12.637 --> 00:02:15.107
That little fatherly support
wouldn't be too much to ask.


44
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:16.843
Are you going
to tell us what's going on,


45
00:02:17.043 --> 00:02:18.610
because I'm still confused.

46
00:02:18.643 --> 00:02:20.545
Okay,
that lisp is a little annoying.


47
00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.015
What it means
is that I was 100% correct.


48
00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.719
That horse is a fucking gold
mine and nobody has a clue.


49
00:02:26.752 --> 00:02:29.487
Hold it,
you just happened to find


50
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:32.091
the stallion whose
grand sire was Secretariat?


51
00:02:32.124 --> 00:02:34.760
I can always smell
out quality horse flesh.


52
00:02:35.228 --> 00:02:37.997
That, and write catchy
pop tunes that involve dessert


53
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.732
- toppings and the weather.
- Yes, indeed.


54
00:02:39.765 --> 00:02:42.434
And now my plan
comes to fruition.


55
00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:45.637
We're going to illegally
harvest this magical horse


56
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.107
semen and sell
it to the highest echelons


57
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.641
of the equine universe.

58
00:02:49.842 --> 00:02:53.880
Oh, so it's just
a get-rich-quick scheme. Sad.


59
00:02:53.913 --> 00:02:56.615
Did you blow all your rock
star money back in the day?


60
00:02:56.648 --> 00:02:58.751
Hell no,
I'm a millionaire, lady.


61
00:02:58.784 --> 00:03:01.187
But I sunk all of my
money into this scheme,


62
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.023
and when I sell
that sweet white gold,


63
00:03:04.056 --> 00:03:07.159
I'm going to be
a goddamn billionaire.


64
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.742
What the fuck
are you guys laughing at?


65
00:03:22.775 --> 00:03:24.043
I'm going to be
the goddamn billionaire.


66
00:03:24.076 --> 00:03:25.477
You'll still
be working for scale.


67
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.578
Huh.

68
00:04:03.215 --> 00:04:06.152
Stink bombs, really?

69
00:04:06.651 --> 00:04:08.788
Mom, I can't
talk about this again.


70
00:04:08.821 --> 00:04:11.824
One year left, and you had
to go and throw it all away?


71
00:04:11.857 --> 00:04:15.061
Don't be dramatic. I'm still
finishing senior year, just...


72
00:04:15.094 --> 00:04:19.564
- Gonna be at an online school.
- Oh, an online school. Perfect.


73
00:04:19.597 --> 00:04:21.633
Your future employers
are going to love that.


74
00:04:23.568 --> 00:04:26.272
I just hope working at your
dad's is going to instill some


75
00:04:26.305 --> 00:04:28.540
- responsibility in you.
- That's not fair.


76
00:04:28.573 --> 00:04:31.978
Yeah, well, life's not fair.
Welcome to adulthood.


77
00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:33.578
- Fuck this.
- Look.


78
00:04:34.347 --> 00:04:36.882
I know your dad's not your
favorite person right now.


79
00:04:36.916 --> 00:04:38.150
He left us for a farm.

80
00:04:38.616 --> 00:04:40.186
Pretty sure 'not
my favorite person'


81
00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:41.686
would be
the understatement of the year.


82
00:04:44.123 --> 00:04:46.058
Local authorities
are still investigating


83
00:04:46.092 --> 00:04:47.994
a spade of horse farm
disturbances believed


84
00:04:48.027 --> 00:04:50.662
to be linked to an illegal
horse semen smuggling ring.


85
00:04:50.695 --> 00:04:52.697
- If anyone has inf...
- What kind of freak town


86
00:04:52.732 --> 00:04:54.166
are you leaving me in?

87
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.935
Hey, you seem to love hijinks.

88
00:04:55.968 --> 00:04:57.770
Why don't you help
the police find the culprit?


89
00:04:58.104 --> 00:05:00.740
Ugh, this is going to be
the worst week of my life.


90
00:05:42.782 --> 00:05:44.884
Hey, I love you.

91
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.722
Oh, gross.

92
00:05:50.622 --> 00:05:51.824
Hi, guys.

93
00:05:52.258 --> 00:05:57.595
Yes, hi, and bye. A little
too much nature round here.


94
00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:59.031
Nice to see you again,
Cassandra.


95
00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:03.135
Nate, behave yourself.

96
00:06:07.672 --> 00:06:11.777
- Glad you decided to come up.
- Trust me, wasn't my choice.


97
00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:15.247
There's literally
shit right there.


98
00:06:15.281 --> 00:06:17.316
Ah, that's horse poop.

99
00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:19.285
And I'd get used to it, kiddo.

100
00:06:19.584 --> 00:06:20.853
I sure did.

101
00:06:21.487 --> 00:06:23.923
Thought this farm would
be more of a shack.


102
00:06:25.324 --> 00:06:26.591
It's...

103
00:06:27.393 --> 00:06:28.828
beautiful, isn't it?

104
00:06:28.861 --> 00:06:30.262
Not really my scene,

105
00:06:30.296 --> 00:06:33.365
but I guess some
people would say it's... nice.


106
00:06:35.034 --> 00:06:39.271
- That's a nice camera.
- Thanks.


107
00:06:39.805 --> 00:06:42.007
Won it in a school
photo competish.


108
00:06:44.276 --> 00:06:47.146
- Who's that?
- Chaz Mollar.


109
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:52.885
Devon, my guy.

110
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.189
Chaz.
This is my son, Nathan.


111
00:06:57.223 --> 00:07:01.160
Great.
So, where's my dad's cheque?


112
00:07:01.927 --> 00:07:05.097
- Who's your dad?
- The farm's landlord.


113
00:07:05.564 --> 00:07:08.367
I didn't think you'd be by
today, you were supposed to,


114
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.035
what,
stop over a few hours ago?


115
00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:11.804
Yeah, well,
it was leg day the gym.


116
00:07:12.571 --> 00:07:14.940
Sculpted calves
don't come for free. Right?


117
00:07:18.777 --> 00:07:21.280
- Cheque.
- I'll get your dad's cheque.


118
00:07:22.848 --> 00:07:24.717
Wanna... the bag?

119
00:07:31.924 --> 00:07:33.993
Yeah, I didn't
know Kev had a kid.


120
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.262
Didn't know the farm
had a landlord.


121
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:41.300
Oh, your grandfather,
gambled it away before he died.


122
00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:43.369
Yeah,
it's pretty sad if you ask me.


123
00:07:45.404 --> 00:07:46.671
Whatever.

124
00:07:47.506 --> 00:07:50.342
- I hate farms.
- Me too.


125
00:07:51.944 --> 00:07:53.678
You from the city?

126
00:07:55.181 --> 00:07:56.916
- Yeah.
- Yo, no bullshit...


127
00:07:57.917 --> 00:07:59.218
I got those same shoes.

128
00:08:01.487 --> 00:08:03.455
- Hmm.
- Here.


129
00:08:04.757 --> 00:08:06.225
Nice meetin' ya.

130
00:08:07.993 --> 00:08:11.197
Hi dad. I told you never
to call me Cornelius.


131
00:08:11.564 --> 00:08:13.966
- I'm Chaz now.
- His name's... Cornelius?


132
00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:15.301
Yeah, no,
Gucci wants a persona.


133
00:08:25.911 --> 00:08:27.112
You know,
you guys look like


134
00:08:27.146 --> 00:08:28.380
you're in
a Brawny paper towel ad.


135
00:08:31.917 --> 00:08:34.420
- Bye.
- God, I hate that kid.


136
00:08:36.488 --> 00:08:38.757
Let's get you settled in.

137
00:08:40.025 --> 00:08:41.093
Great.

138
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:20.165
Um, Dad?
Was grandpa a gambler?


139
00:09:20.199 --> 00:09:22.935
What? No.

140
00:09:23.602 --> 00:09:26.171
- Why would you even ask that?
- That's what Chaz said.


141
00:09:27.606 --> 00:09:29.174
Don't listen to anything
that he has to say.


142
00:09:29.842 --> 00:09:31.777
Then why are you
giving them cheques?


143
00:09:32.044 --> 00:09:33.579
Um, tax reasons.

144
00:09:33.612 --> 00:09:36.282
It's really too
complicated to explain.


145
00:09:39.285 --> 00:09:42.087
- Don't you just love that air?
- It's air.


146
00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:43.522
No, that's air air.

147
00:09:43.889 --> 00:09:47.026
- Not that polluted city crap.
- Huh.


148
00:09:48.427 --> 00:09:50.796
And this is Sarah.

149
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.966
She has been a life saver,
helping me with the horses.


150
00:09:55.367 --> 00:09:58.070
- You're Nathan, yeah?
- Mhm.


151
00:09:58.103 --> 00:09:59.972
Your dad can't shut up about
you, dude fucking loves you.


152
00:10:00.005 --> 00:10:01.874
Hey, what'd I say?

153
00:10:01.907 --> 00:10:04.543
Excuse me, your dad seems to
think that my swearing around


154
00:10:04.576 --> 00:10:06.211
the horses will give
them some sort of complex.


155
00:10:06.245 --> 00:10:07.346
Yeah, 'cause it does.

156
00:10:07.747 --> 00:10:10.449
All right, well, I better
finish this guy's ride.


157
00:10:10.683 --> 00:10:12.318
- Let's fuckin' go.
- Sarah!


158
00:10:22.294 --> 00:10:23.362
That's the bed.

159
00:10:39.378 --> 00:10:40.446
Fuck you.

160
00:10:45.484 --> 00:10:49.321
- Fucking horses? What do you...
- Hey, kiddo.


161
00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:51.890
Hey, Kevin.

162
00:10:52.491 --> 00:10:55.260
You, uh, talking to yourself?

163
00:10:55.294 --> 00:10:57.229
I mean, I used
to talk to myself too.


164
00:10:57.529 --> 00:10:58.897
I wasn't talking to myself.

165
00:10:59.631 --> 00:11:01.200
Okay.

166
00:11:02.067 --> 00:11:04.169
Hey you know, you can,
you can do all that later.


167
00:11:04.203 --> 00:11:05.904
Come with me.
I've got some, uh,


168
00:11:05.938 --> 00:11:07.639
very important people
for you to meet. Come on.


169
00:11:17.649 --> 00:11:19.485
Now, come here, come here,
come here, come here.


170
00:11:23.155 --> 00:11:27.359
- These are horses, not people.
- Hah, these are my babies.


171
00:11:33.999 --> 00:11:36.201
Nate, come here. I want
you to meet someone special.


172
00:11:41.106 --> 00:11:44.042
Again, a horse, not a someone.

173
00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:47.913
Wait, is there a photo
of him in my room?


174
00:11:48.347 --> 00:11:49.948
Good spotting.

175
00:11:49.982 --> 00:11:52.618
This is Fritz.
He's one of our finest.


176
00:11:52.985 --> 00:11:55.554
But, he's been
a little off lately.


177
00:11:56.355 --> 00:11:57.489
How can a horse be off?

178
00:11:57.824 --> 00:11:59.091
You can just feel it.

179
00:12:01.393 --> 00:12:03.295
I, I brought you up here 'cause

180
00:12:03.328 --> 00:12:05.497
I was hoping, uh, maybe
you could help him out.


181
00:12:05.531 --> 00:12:07.266
Bring a fresh
energy to the place.


182
00:12:07.299 --> 00:12:09.201
Horses aren't really my thing.

183
00:12:09.836 --> 00:12:11.503
Come on, kiddo.
Don't be scared now.


184
00:12:12.538 --> 00:12:14.139
I'm not... scared.

185
00:12:20.512 --> 00:12:24.082
- There you go.
- Okay. Exhilarating.


186
00:12:26.485 --> 00:12:27.686
Okay.

187
00:12:37.329 --> 00:12:39.665
Nate, come on,
I want you to meet the others.


188
00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:42.501
- Bitch.
- Did you...?


189
00:12:51.143 --> 00:12:54.513
Nathan, have you ever used
one of these before?


190
00:12:55.447 --> 00:12:58.417
Um, no, I don't like horses.

191
00:12:59.318 --> 00:13:02.054
Or people that like horses.
No offence.


192
00:13:02.087 --> 00:13:04.389
I...

193
00:13:06.425 --> 00:13:07.493
Hi.

194
00:13:09.228 --> 00:13:11.129
Wow, that's...

195
00:13:11.497 --> 00:13:13.599
a lot, but I'm sure that we

196
00:13:13.632 --> 00:13:15.133
can come to some
kind of agreement.


197
00:13:26.245 --> 00:13:27.546
My barn, my rules.

198
00:13:29.548 --> 00:13:32.417
Oh my...

199
00:13:32.451 --> 00:13:34.152
Oh, this is my
fucking favorite pair.


200
00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.755
You okay?

201
00:13:35.788 --> 00:13:37.356
Shit.

202
00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:38.690
Hey, Sarah.

203
00:13:39.191 --> 00:13:41.093
- Hey.
- There you are.


204
00:13:41.126 --> 00:13:44.563
Would you be sure you,
uh, do his legs up tonight?


205
00:13:44.596 --> 00:13:46.498
- He worked hard today.
- Sure.


206
00:13:46.532 --> 00:13:47.599
Thanks.

207
00:13:50.702 --> 00:13:53.205
Looks like you're going
to need some new boots.


208
00:13:54.206 --> 00:13:55.775
- Not really my style.
- Huh.


209
00:13:57.744 --> 00:13:59.444
Are you, uh, Kevin's kid?

210
00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.347
That's me.

211
00:14:02.749 --> 00:14:06.184
Have you, uh, been
out to see the farm?


212
00:14:06.218 --> 00:14:08.654
- It's a farm.
- Ha, really?


213
00:14:09.488 --> 00:14:13.726
Well, maybe you should, ah,
get Sarah to take you out


214
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.395
for a drive in the golf
cart and show you around.


215
00:14:16.695 --> 00:14:18.530
But, uh, careful.

216
00:14:18.564 --> 00:14:20.666
She drives pretty fast.

217
00:14:23.201 --> 00:14:25.270
Woo!

218
00:14:34.379 --> 00:14:35.480
Oh, God.

219
00:14:40.319 --> 00:14:41.520
Jesus.

220
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.255
Whoa.

221
00:14:49.428 --> 00:14:51.697
- What?
- N-Nothing.


222
00:14:52.031 --> 00:14:53.632
Never seen a girl
with a gun before?


223
00:14:54.132 --> 00:14:59.471
- Never seen a gun before?
- Aw, city boy.


224
00:15:06.846 --> 00:15:07.880
Here.

225
00:15:09.247 --> 00:15:12.417
Earplugs? Seriously?
What am I, 80?


226
00:15:13.285 --> 00:15:14.353
Suit yourself.

227
00:15:18.223 --> 00:15:19.658
Gonna need
those glasses, though.


228
00:15:26.264 --> 00:15:27.532
Wait.

229
00:15:44.917 --> 00:15:46.618
Uh.
Just gonna...


230
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.288
Yeah, what was that you
were saying about earplugs?


231
00:16:09.374 --> 00:16:10.409
What?

232
00:16:10.442 --> 00:16:11.878
Uh...

233
00:16:11.911 --> 00:16:13.913
There's
a, flock of, flock of geese.


234
00:16:14.379 --> 00:16:17.315
There's a pigeon. Somewhere.

235
00:16:19.584 --> 00:16:20.686
What's the matter with you?

236
00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:30.462
So, where did
you two sneak off to?


237
00:16:30.495 --> 00:16:31.898
Took him to the range.

238
00:16:31.931 --> 00:16:33.398
- Did you hit it?
- Yep.


239
00:16:34.366 --> 00:16:36.769
- Huh?

240
00:16:36.803 --> 00:16:39.939
Did you hit it?
Did you hit one of the targets?


241
00:16:39.972 --> 00:16:41.540
Oh.

242
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.609
Right. No, no, I didn't.

243
00:16:44.643 --> 00:16:46.511
Ready to start work tomorrow?

244
00:16:46.545 --> 00:16:48.213
Not really.

245
00:16:48.413 --> 00:16:50.582
Let me guess, city boy's
never had a real job.


246
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.752
Yes.
Does selling Adderall count?


247
00:16:53.886 --> 00:16:55.320
It was a joke.

248
00:16:55.955 --> 00:16:57.656
I wasn't joking.

249
00:16:57.689 --> 00:16:59.357
It's, uh, good to work
with your hands, you know?


250
00:16:59.391 --> 00:17:01.961
Insert yourself. Get dirty.

251
00:17:04.396 --> 00:17:08.266
- Yeah.
- Something funny?


252
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.769
No.

253
00:17:09.802 --> 00:17:12.637
Can't wait to insert myself.

254
00:17:12.671 --> 00:17:14.339
Put in a good hard day's work.

255
00:17:14.372 --> 00:17:15.640
- Real hard.
- Yeah.


256
00:17:41.067 --> 00:17:44.636
Bi-ii-tch.

257
00:17:56.082 --> 00:17:58.583
Oh, Sarah.

258
00:18:03.522 --> 00:18:05.057
Oh my god.

259
00:18:05.792 --> 00:18:07.059
Yeah, fuck yeah.

260
00:18:11.563 --> 00:18:13.598
- What?
- Time to get up.


261
00:18:13.632 --> 00:18:15.567
The farm waits for no one.

262
00:18:16.736 --> 00:18:18.470
Not much of a morning person.

263
00:18:20.807 --> 00:18:21.941
Oh.

264
00:18:22.809 --> 00:18:24.977
Looks like you've
already gotten up.


265
00:18:25.011 --> 00:18:26.344
Um...

266
00:18:26.813 --> 00:18:29.816
That's just a design
flaw in the sheets.


267
00:18:29.849 --> 00:18:31.984
Wow, you're a terrible liar.

268
00:18:32.018 --> 00:18:33.685
Time to get cracking, city boy.

269
00:18:35.121 --> 00:18:37.589
Seriously?

270
00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.976
It'd probably help if you pour
the coffee, then drink it.


271
00:18:57.844 --> 00:18:58.945
Thanks for the tip.

272
00:19:01.513 --> 00:19:04.150
Oh, I see Sarah
got you up this morning.


273
00:19:04.183 --> 00:19:06.551
Oh, he had no
problem getting up.


274
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.355
That's my boy, fitting
right into the farm life.


275
00:19:35.614 --> 00:19:38.683
- Really pull it.
- I'm using all my body weight.


276
00:19:38.718 --> 00:19:41.153
All right, well that's sad.
Just, try again.


277
00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.962
You know what, just give
it to me. Give it to me.


278
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:55.835
I think there might, might
be something broken on there.


279
00:20:01.874 --> 00:20:04.043
Uh, my arms
are tired from last night.


280
00:20:04.076 --> 00:20:06.712
I was-I wasn't jerking off,
I was-I was doing push-ups.


281
00:20:10.783 --> 00:20:11.951
There's so much shit.

282
00:20:27.233 --> 00:20:28.566
Shit!

283
00:20:29.969 --> 00:20:32.570
Fucking...
shit all in it.


284
00:20:34.173 --> 00:20:36.042
- Shit!
- It's all about


285
00:20:36.075 --> 00:20:39.078
the rhythm, and make sure you
use your knees when you lift


286
00:20:39.111 --> 00:20:42.014
or else you'll have one hell
of a backache tomorrow.


287
00:20:42.048 --> 00:20:44.050
- I got this.
- Woah, woah woah.


288
00:20:44.083 --> 00:20:47.585
Yo, Scary!
Busted bail, busted bail.


289
00:20:48.955 --> 00:20:50.488
What's going on?

290
00:20:50.823 --> 00:20:51.924
Grab the pitchfork.

291
00:20:52.291 --> 00:20:54.592
- Take it down, first.
- Okay, alright.


292
00:21:10.309 --> 00:21:12.178
I got it, I got it.

293
00:21:14.213 --> 00:21:15.881
Are you sure?

294
00:21:16.248 --> 00:21:18.918
Yeah, it's easy.
I could do this all day.


295
00:21:19.385 --> 00:21:22.188
Shit!

296
00:21:24.589 --> 00:21:25.925
What the hell?

297
00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:28.060
Uh, does that like,
happen sometimes?


298
00:21:28.094 --> 00:21:30.695
- Uh, nope.
- This is not good.


299
00:21:41.307 --> 00:21:43.042
Keep up,
you're burning daylight.


300
00:21:43.242 --> 00:21:44.910
Okay, okay, God.

301
00:21:44.944 --> 00:21:46.912
Sorry about the hay
stuff or whatever.


302
00:21:46.946 --> 00:21:48.646
"Or whatever?"

303
00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.249
- Are you serious right now?
- It was an accident.


304
00:21:50.282 --> 00:21:52.952
An expensive accident
that I can't afford to cover.


305
00:21:52.985 --> 00:21:54.820
You know, you've got
to grow up sometime, Nathan.


306
00:21:54.854 --> 00:21:56.588
- You can't be a kid forever.
- Grow up?


307
00:21:56.621 --> 00:21:58.324
I'm not the one running
around playing Peter Pan.


308
00:21:58.357 --> 00:22:00.826
You left mom
and I for a stupid farm.


309
00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.294
Uh, there's far more
to it than you know.


310
00:22:02.328 --> 00:22:03.561
Screw you.

311
00:22:03.996 --> 00:22:05.898
Hey, don't talk to your
dad like that.


312
00:22:05.931 --> 00:22:07.767
You mean the dad I haven't
seen in over a year?


313
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.635
I have invited you
up here so many times.


314
00:22:10.668 --> 00:22:12.805
Excuse me if I didn't want
to visit my deadbeat dad


315
00:22:12.838 --> 00:22:14.740
- ...and a bunch of horseshit.
- Nat-Nathan.


316
00:22:15.908 --> 00:22:17.109
You're way off the mark.

317
00:22:18.077 --> 00:22:19.278
Fuck. You.

318
00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:22.782
- You know what?
- What?


319
00:22:23.615 --> 00:22:26.252
I would have thought
you'd have at least matured


320
00:22:26.285 --> 00:22:27.652
a little bit by now.

321
00:22:28.454 --> 00:22:30.555
But I can see you're,
you're still the same.


322
00:22:31.656 --> 00:22:33.225
It's high time
you took accountability.


323
00:22:33.259 --> 00:22:34.860
You're going have
to pay for that baler incident.


324
00:22:34.894 --> 00:22:36.829
That's at least
a month's worth of work.


325
00:22:36.862 --> 00:22:38.630
I was only supposed
to be for a week.


326
00:22:38.663 --> 00:22:40.166
- I can't be here for a month.
- Why not?


327
00:22:40.199 --> 00:22:41.901
You are expelled.

328
00:22:42.168 --> 00:22:43.936
It's not like you
have a classroom to be in.


329
00:22:44.236 --> 00:22:45.805
I have online school.

330
00:22:45.838 --> 00:22:47.672
And that's the beauty
of online school.


331
00:22:47.705 --> 00:22:50.142
You can take it anywhere,
even your deadbeat dad's farm.


332
00:22:53.012 --> 00:22:55.014
Uh, I'll be so bored.

333
00:22:55.047 --> 00:22:56.916
You uh, can't be bored...

334
00:22:58.217 --> 00:23:00.319
if you're busy.

335
00:23:02.354 --> 00:23:04.156
Don't worry.

336
00:23:04.824 --> 00:23:07.827
There's plenty of poop
with your name on it.


337
00:23:19.238 --> 00:23:21.273
Oh, what do they eat?

338
00:23:30.916 --> 00:23:34.753
This is shit. I hate this shit.
So much shit in here.


339
00:23:35.121 --> 00:23:37.689
Kevin's a piece of shit.
So much horseshit.


340
00:23:37.723 --> 00:23:40.893
Oh, this is too much.

341
00:23:50.803 --> 00:23:52.771
Fuck!

342
00:24:19.865 --> 00:24:22.401
- Woah, shit.
- Literally.


343
00:24:24.937 --> 00:24:27.206
Hey, I'm more of a tulips guy,
but, I'll take 'em.


344
00:24:27.239 --> 00:24:29.141
You wish. Seen Sarah?

345
00:24:29.508 --> 00:24:32.244
Nah, man. Been shoveling
shit for the past few hours.


346
00:24:32.811 --> 00:24:35.314
- Why?
- I'm trying to win her back.


347
00:24:35.347 --> 00:24:37.016
Win her back?

348
00:24:37.049 --> 00:24:39.051
Yeah, we dated,
but she couldn't handle


349
00:24:39.084 --> 00:24:40.753
the Chaz lifestyle, so.

350
00:24:40.786 --> 00:24:42.755
What's the Chaz lifestyle?

351
00:24:42.788 --> 00:24:44.723
Pfft, oh man.

352
00:24:46.292 --> 00:24:49.228
<i>♪ More
intense than Alcatraz ♪</i>


353
00:24:49.261 --> 00:24:54.500
<i>♪ That's what
it's like to be around Chaz ♪</i>


354
00:24:56.268 --> 00:24:58.804
Damn, that was good.
Oh, I gotta write that down.


355
00:24:58.837 --> 00:25:02.141
- Sounded... great. Yeah.
- Right, that was good, huh?


356
00:25:02.174 --> 00:25:03.375
- Yeah.
- Wow.


357
00:25:03.409 --> 00:25:05.311
So, um...

358
00:25:05.844 --> 00:25:08.047
How long did
you and Sarah date?


359
00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.915
Like, two years,
something dumb.


360
00:25:09.949 --> 00:25:11.016
Yeah, what
are you doing tonight?


361
00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:12.518
Uh...

362
00:25:12.551 --> 00:25:15.054
My friend's on a fucking
cleanse so he can't drink.


363
00:25:15.087 --> 00:25:18.057
- I need someone fun.
- Maaa...


364
00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:19.892
Hey, you
still shoveling out there?


365
00:25:20.526 --> 00:25:23.262
Unless if you wanna hang
around with your loser ass dad.


366
00:25:24.463 --> 00:25:26.432
- I guess so.
- Talk to me.


367
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.369
Yeah, Dad, just get her like
a doll house and a Mercedes.


368
00:25:30.402 --> 00:25:33.239
She should be fine, she's
eight. That's a perfect gift.


369
00:25:33.272 --> 00:25:35.808
And can you do something about
these horses, I think they're


370
00:25:35.841 --> 00:25:38.277
making me allergic...

371
00:25:38.611 --> 00:25:41.480
- What?
- Loser.


372
00:25:41.513 --> 00:25:43.549
Shut up.

373
00:25:43.582 --> 00:25:47.152
- Hilarious.
- Loser.


374
00:25:47.886 --> 00:25:49.855
Thanks for
the vote of confidence.


375
00:25:49.888 --> 00:25:51.223
Anytime.

376
00:25:55.961 --> 00:25:58.897
- Nice roses.
- Oh, yeah.


377
00:25:59.932 --> 00:26:02.835
Let me guess. Chaz?

378
00:26:03.202 --> 00:26:05.304
Who else would get
such a ridiculous bouquet?


379
00:26:05.337 --> 00:26:08.540
You know, we're surrounded
by such beautiful wildflowers.


380
00:26:08.574 --> 00:26:10.509
I don't want
a store bought bouquet.


381
00:26:10.542 --> 00:26:13.012
All I want
is for someone to treat me well


382
00:26:13.045 --> 00:26:15.481
and pick wildflowers
they think I might like.


383
00:26:16.015 --> 00:26:18.484
Why do I think
that this has to do


384
00:26:18.517 --> 00:26:20.286
with more than just flowers?

385
00:26:20.319 --> 00:26:22.955
- Yeah, well, after what he did?
- Oh, yeah, I get it.


386
00:26:22.988 --> 00:26:25.024
So, any news on the baler?

387
00:26:25.057 --> 00:26:29.094
$12,000 to fix the damn thing.

388
00:26:29.128 --> 00:26:31.363
I told Nathan that he's going
to have to help pay for it,


389
00:26:31.397 --> 00:26:33.032
but even a month
of his working here


390
00:26:33.065 --> 00:26:34.500
is not gonna put
a dent in that cost.


391
00:26:34.533 --> 00:26:36.302
Nathan's going
to be here longer?


392
00:26:37.202 --> 00:26:39.004
Yeah.

393
00:26:39.038 --> 00:26:42.441
I just, I can't wrap my head
around why he would do it.


394
00:26:42.474 --> 00:26:45.844
- What was he trying to prove?
- I don't know.


395
00:26:45.878 --> 00:26:48.347
I wish that kid had
an ounce of your diligence.


396
00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.883
Sarah, you are
a credit to your parents.


397
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:53.218
Nathan, on the other hand...

398
00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.488
What a dick.

399
00:26:57.956 --> 00:26:59.258
What the fuck?

400
00:27:00.959 --> 00:27:05.931
He's got a good heart.
He's just... a troublemaker.


401
00:27:05.964 --> 00:27:07.466
Well, I better
steer clear of him.


402
00:27:07.966 --> 00:27:11.937
Apparently, I'm
a sucker for trouble makers.


403
00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.038
You're my kind
scientist, lady.


404
00:27:46.071 --> 00:27:47.239
Go for Judge.

405
00:27:48.207 --> 00:27:49.608
I can't hear you.

406
00:27:49.641 --> 00:27:51.310
You sound like you're
either at a redneck bar,


407
00:27:51.343 --> 00:27:52.578
or a Bob Seger concert.

408
00:27:52.611 --> 00:27:54.413
- Yes, I see.
- Yeah, you'd better see.


409
00:27:54.446 --> 00:27:56.548
You better fucking see,
you better fucking see Nathan,


410
00:27:56.582 --> 00:27:59.151
and you better keep fucking
seeing him until we can figure


411
00:27:59.184 --> 00:28:00.953
out whether or not
he's a problem


412
00:28:00.986 --> 00:28:02.588
or else I'm going to shove
one harmonica up your ass


413
00:28:02.621 --> 00:28:04.356
and the other
down your throat,


414
00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:06.024
and you're going to
harmonize in the middle, son.


415
00:28:06.058 --> 00:28:07.626
Oh heavens, no, we
certainly don't want that.


416
00:28:08.293 --> 00:28:11.263
Rest assured
you have our full support.


417
00:28:11.296 --> 00:28:14.299
- Don't you worry one gummy bear.
- Gummy bears?


418
00:28:14.333 --> 00:28:15.601
This might not be
politically correct,


419
00:28:15.634 --> 00:28:17.403
but are you fucking
retarded, boy?


420
00:28:17.436 --> 00:28:19.638
I'm talking about billions
of dollars of jail time,


421
00:28:19.671 --> 00:28:22.408
and you're talking about
motherfucking gummy bears?


422
00:28:22.441 --> 00:28:24.476
I agree.
I shouldn't have said that.


423
00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:26.245
Let me try and explain
something to you.


424
00:28:26.278 --> 00:28:28.981
This is about trickling down,

425
00:28:29.014 --> 00:28:31.383
and some of this might
trickle down to you.


426
00:28:31.417 --> 00:28:33.352
But if I get busted,

427
00:28:33.385 --> 00:28:35.954
the only trickling down is
going to be when your cellmate


428
00:28:35.988 --> 00:28:39.258
pisses in your face,
is that clear enough for you?


429
00:28:39.291 --> 00:28:42.729
Oh, speak of the devil.
The dove has entered the coop.


430
00:28:42.762 --> 00:28:44.396
Just forget about
the fucking codes


431
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.698
and see if that kid's
going to be a problem.


432
00:28:46.733 --> 00:28:48.634
Hey, can I get...

433
00:28:48.667 --> 00:28:51.503
Hello, I'm standing,
I'm literally right here.


434
00:28:51.537 --> 00:28:53.305
You know, it's so easy
to make a child,


435
00:28:53.338 --> 00:28:55.307
- but so difficult to raise one.
- Mmm.


436
00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.009
Especially when you deny
their existence.


437
00:28:58.076 --> 00:29:02.047
So, is that dress button
or snap because you've got


438
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.449
a couple of hematomas,

439
00:29:03.482 --> 00:29:05.050
they're just begging
for a mouth biopsy.


440
00:29:14.092 --> 00:29:15.561
I guess this is going
to happen in a bar...


441
00:29:16.295 --> 00:29:18.130
What would you like?

442
00:29:19.732 --> 00:29:21.333
Uh, I'm sorry, what?

443
00:29:22.134 --> 00:29:23.268
To sip.

444
00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:26.004
Um...

445
00:29:27.072 --> 00:29:28.240
A beer?

446
00:29:29.041 --> 00:29:32.411
- Birch Admiral.
- One Birch's brew.


447
00:29:33.579 --> 00:29:35.514
Quick service.

448
00:29:35.547 --> 00:29:37.382
Oh, don't be silly.
Put that away.


449
00:29:38.083 --> 00:29:42.120
The name's Orwell,
Orwell Spunk. And you are?


450
00:29:43.222 --> 00:29:44.289
Uh...

451
00:29:45.624 --> 00:29:48.460
- Nathan.
- Nathaniel...


452
00:29:48.494 --> 00:29:51.163
have you heard
any funny business


453
00:29:51.196 --> 00:29:53.365
- regarding horses?
- What?


454
00:29:53.398 --> 00:29:56.502
- Any stallion shenanigans?
- Huh?


455
00:29:57.002 --> 00:29:59.438
Then you haven't.
you know nothing.


456
00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:01.173
Just as I expected.

457
00:30:01.206 --> 00:30:03.108
Hey, what's
happening right now?


458
00:30:03.141 --> 00:30:05.010
Forget this face.

459
00:30:07.546 --> 00:30:10.115
Okay, thanks
for the drink, man.


460
00:30:10.148 --> 00:30:11.784
Nathan. Shots?

461
00:30:14.453 --> 00:30:17.523
Hey, Chaz.
Did you see that guy?


462
00:30:18.357 --> 00:30:19.625
Oh, the Ring Pop guy?

463
00:30:19.959 --> 00:30:22.060
Yeah, no, we call him
the Velveteen Rabbit.


464
00:30:22.094 --> 00:30:23.262
Here, come over to Zach.

465
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:32.037
Shots, shots, shots.

466
00:30:32.704 --> 00:30:34.306
You go, lightweight.

467
00:30:36.308 --> 00:30:37.376
Cheers.

468
00:30:40.312 --> 00:30:44.784
You're an embarrassment.
Put that away. Ha ha, cheers.


469
00:30:50.155 --> 00:30:53.726
Ugh. I miss Sarah.

470
00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.795
We had our first kiss here.

471
00:30:56.328 --> 00:30:58.263
What happened between you two?

472
00:30:58.297 --> 00:31:01.333
It was a
miscommunication, that's all.


473
00:31:01.366 --> 00:31:04.336
He got banned
from Crown Liquors for life.


474
00:31:04.369 --> 00:31:05.571
What?

475
00:31:05.838 --> 00:31:09.541
Hey, I got to take
this call. Hello?


476
00:31:09.842 --> 00:31:11.878
- This is Chaz.
- That's not your phone.


477
00:31:11.911 --> 00:31:14.479
Who do you think this is?
I know what my phone is.


478
00:31:15.347 --> 00:31:16.415
Good day.

479
00:31:16.716 --> 00:31:18.483
Oh shit, this isn't my phone.

480
00:31:19.719 --> 00:31:21.186
Dude, we gotta go
to the liquor s-store.


481
00:31:21.219 --> 00:31:22.654
We gotta get booze, man.

482
00:31:22.688 --> 00:31:24.489
Chaz,
we're at the liquor store.


483
00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:28.728
Aw, shit. That's, that's
Sarah's stepmom dude.


484
00:31:28.761 --> 00:31:30.462
That's-yeah.

485
00:31:30.495 --> 00:31:32.564
Dude, I know they're
not related,


486
00:31:32.598 --> 00:31:35.334
but they have like,
the same butt, right?


487
00:31:35.367 --> 00:31:39.137
Yeah, they totally do.
Check this out.


488
00:31:39.371 --> 00:31:41.841
Cha... No, Chaz, no.

489
00:31:41.874 --> 00:31:43.675
Hey, baby. How you doin'?

490
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:45.243
Oof.

491
00:31:48.748 --> 00:31:51.483
- Chaz?
- Hi, Mrs. Proctor, how are you?


492
00:31:51.951 --> 00:31:54.152
Turn that thing off.

493
00:31:54.419 --> 00:31:57.556
- That's pretty fucked up.
- Whatever. All right.


494
00:31:57.589 --> 00:32:00.225
I'm, I'm a very talented
singer songwriter.


495
00:32:00.258 --> 00:32:03.362
Everybody wants me,
so I'll be fine.


496
00:32:04.529 --> 00:32:06.632
Bury me in Fireball!

497
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.135
Oh, shit.

498
00:32:12.571 --> 00:32:15.340
Good morning,
Western Massachusetts.


499
00:32:15.374 --> 00:32:18.377
It's another beautiful fall
day here in the Berkshires,


500
00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.613
clear and breezy
with a high of 61.


501
00:32:21.647 --> 00:32:24.616
Oh, that foliage
is sure beautiful.


502
00:32:29.789 --> 00:32:31.223
Hey, Nathan.

503
00:32:33.793 --> 00:32:38.497
I, uh, I wanted
to apologize for yesterday.


504
00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:41.466
I know that things
have been bad, but...


505
00:32:41.868 --> 00:32:43.903
I shouldn't have said some
of the things that I said.


506
00:32:43.936 --> 00:32:45.404
Nathan.

507
00:32:45.437 --> 00:32:46.739
Nathan.

508
00:32:47.974 --> 00:32:49.374
Nathan.

509
00:32:50.542 --> 00:32:52.912
Nathan, come on. Nat...

510
00:32:55.681 --> 00:32:57.449
Teenagers.

511
00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:01.486
- He'll come around.
- Hey, buddy,


512
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.956
we're gonna need your
special fecal matter skills.


513
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:06.959
Are you trying to get
him to love you or hate you?


514
00:33:06.993 --> 00:33:08.828
What? Well, no,
I just think he needs


515
00:33:08.861 --> 00:33:10.997
- to learn a lesson in humility.
- Well, not that way.


516
00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:12.932
You know, I'm gonna have to
write down your little pearls


517
00:33:12.965 --> 00:33:14.834
- of wisdom someday, Mary.
- Oh, okay.


518
00:33:14.867 --> 00:33:17.402
Okay, well, I would
try something nicer.


519
00:33:17.436 --> 00:33:19.538
Like, let's go for a ride.
and you can help us.


520
00:33:19.571 --> 00:33:23.475
Picking up shit is not
the first lesson for him.


521
00:33:23.508 --> 00:33:26.344
Then get down off his
high horse. Forgive the pun.


522
00:33:26.378 --> 00:33:27.646
You're the dad.

523
00:34:22.902 --> 00:34:24.737
How you
doin' back there, kiddo?


524
00:34:39.752 --> 00:34:41.620
I don't know how
I can afford it all.


525
00:34:41.988 --> 00:34:46.793
The rent, the conveyor
incident. It's too much.


526
00:34:46.826 --> 00:34:49.628
You'll figure it out.
You always do.


527
00:34:49.896 --> 00:34:52.999
I don't know about this time,
Mary. I'm losing the farm.


528
00:34:53.032 --> 00:34:56.434
I'm at odds with my son. He
hates it here and he hates me.


529
00:34:56.468 --> 00:35:00.006
You can't treat him like
a child and expect him


530
00:35:00.039 --> 00:35:02.942
- to act like an adult.
- What am I supposed to do?


531
00:35:02.975 --> 00:35:05.410
Give him a little freedom.

532
00:35:06.444 --> 00:35:07.747
- Does he ride?
- No,


533
00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:11.383
I, uh, wanted to teach
him to ride Fritz,


534
00:35:11.416 --> 00:35:13.518
but he's made it pretty clear
he wants nothing to do with me.


535
00:35:13.552 --> 00:35:15.420
Don't be such a sad sack.

536
00:35:15.453 --> 00:35:19.624
How about having Sarah teach
him how to ride? He likes her.


537
00:35:19.658 --> 00:35:23.595
It would be fun.
He might feel accomplished.


538
00:35:23.996 --> 00:35:25.064
Be good for him.

539
00:35:37.944 --> 00:35:40.046
What are you looking for?

540
00:35:40.079 --> 00:35:42.148
His bridle.
I could have sworn


541
00:35:42.181 --> 00:35:43.582
I put it over here earlier.

542
00:35:43.615 --> 00:35:45.117
Floor. Floor.

543
00:35:47.686 --> 00:35:49.121
Is this it?

544
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:52.357
That's weird.

545
00:35:53.358 --> 00:35:55.795
I would have never put a
bridle on the floor like that.


546
00:35:59.866 --> 00:36:02.534
Hey, wimp. Wimp.

547
00:36:07.807 --> 00:36:10.508
Hey, buddy.
Scared of the big bad horse?


548
00:36:11.878 --> 00:36:13.913
No.

549
00:36:14.646 --> 00:36:15.915
Come on.

550
00:36:16.215 --> 00:36:17.616
It's easy.

551
00:36:23.022 --> 00:36:27.659
Tell you what.
You ride me, I'll ride you.


552
00:36:29.929 --> 00:36:31.596
Not so scary, huh?

553
00:36:37.904 --> 00:36:39.038
How are you feeling?

554
00:36:39.372 --> 00:36:43.608
Who, me? Easy breezy.

555
00:36:43.843 --> 00:36:45.878
Nathan, don't lie to me.

556
00:36:45.912 --> 00:36:50.548
- What a pussy.
- I may be a tinge stressed out


557
00:36:50.582 --> 00:36:52.484
the 2000 pound
animal in front of me.


558
00:36:52.919 --> 00:36:54.619
Pfft.
You're gonna be fine.


559
00:36:54.653 --> 00:36:55.721
- Pussy.
- Shh.


560
00:36:56.155 --> 00:36:57.489
Did you just shush me?

561
00:36:58.224 --> 00:37:02.094
No, I, talk to myself
sometimes.


562
00:37:02.128 --> 00:37:04.163
Honestly, I talk
to myself too, sometimes.


563
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:08.134
Horses are just like people.

564
00:37:08.167 --> 00:37:10.069
They can be a little
tricky to read.


565
00:37:10.102 --> 00:37:12.138
See, he looks totally calm,

566
00:37:12.171 --> 00:37:14.106
but internally
he's freaking out.


567
00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:15.741
Hey!

568
00:37:15.775 --> 00:37:17.143
He's just
not used to you yet.


569
00:37:17.176 --> 00:37:18.978
Just like
you're not used to him.


570
00:37:19.946 --> 00:37:23.615
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
It's okay. It's okay, Fritz.


571
00:37:24.383 --> 00:37:26.218
He's been
a little off recently.


572
00:37:26.252 --> 00:37:27.753
Try to ride him another day.

573
00:37:35.694 --> 00:37:37.029
Bye, pussy.

574
00:37:39.231 --> 00:37:41.499
- Oh hey, buddy.
- Hi.


575
00:37:42.068 --> 00:37:43.535
Where are you headed?

576
00:37:43.568 --> 00:37:44.870
Um, uh,

577
00:37:44.904 --> 00:37:46.571
Mary, set me
up on a blind date.


578
00:37:46.604 --> 00:37:47.740
Oh.

579
00:37:48.374 --> 00:37:50.542
- Have a really nice time.
- If you want to talk about it...


580
00:37:50.575 --> 00:37:52.011
- Nope! Not at all.
- Look, Nath...


581
00:38:02.755 --> 00:38:05.024
Hey, city, boy. Want
to go to the shooting range?


582
00:38:05.391 --> 00:38:07.226
Nah, I'm good.

583
00:38:07.592 --> 00:38:11.230
You can blow off some steam.
Come on.


584
00:38:12.932 --> 00:38:14.734
Alright, fine. I'm coming.

585
00:38:14.767 --> 00:38:17.602
- You're what?
- I'm coming.


586
00:38:17.635 --> 00:38:19.005
- What?
- I'm com...


587
00:38:20.873 --> 00:38:22.574
I'll be there
in a few minutes.


588
00:38:26.912 --> 00:38:28.781
Shake a leg. Sun's going down.

589
00:38:29.348 --> 00:38:31.917
- Shake a leg?
- Means chop chop, city boy.


590
00:38:33.285 --> 00:38:36.621
Uh oh, I get
to drive the cart. It's cool.


591
00:38:36.654 --> 00:38:40.226
Oh, don't, don't, don't move.
Wait right there.


592
00:38:40.259 --> 00:38:42.328
- What, no. The sun's setting.
- You look...


593
00:38:42.361 --> 00:38:43.661
I need a photo.

594
00:38:47.599 --> 00:38:48.666
Thank you.

595
00:38:50.668 --> 00:38:52.004
Could you...

596
00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:53.305
um...

597
00:38:53.339 --> 00:38:55.207
send that to me so
I can share it?


598
00:38:55.941 --> 00:38:57.943
No one ever
really takes my photo.


599
00:38:59.611 --> 00:39:01.847
That's absolutely their loss.

600
00:39:23.836 --> 00:39:24.904
What's that?

601
00:39:26.138 --> 00:39:28.706
Cicadas. Beautiful, huh?

602
00:39:36.115 --> 00:39:37.216
Can I ask you something?

603
00:39:40.152 --> 00:39:42.021
Does my dad
go on a lot of dates?


604
00:39:42.054 --> 00:39:43.889
Never.

605
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:47.827
- Why?
- He's going on one tonight.


606
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.261
Really?

607
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.065
I mean, he's an adult,
he can do what he wants, but...


608
00:39:54.733 --> 00:39:58.636
he skipped out on my mom
and I, like hardcore.


609
00:40:01.407 --> 00:40:04.276
It's dumb.
It doesn't even matter.


610
00:40:05.244 --> 00:40:06.745
I didn't know that.

611
00:40:07.246 --> 00:40:08.981
He told me a different story.

612
00:40:10.749 --> 00:40:12.785
Well, I guess we tell the
stories we want to believe,


613
00:40:13.352 --> 00:40:15.387
and if we tell
them enough times,


614
00:40:15.421 --> 00:40:17.790
then maybe
they start to be true.


615
00:40:20.326 --> 00:40:22.928
- You need a party.
- Huh?


616
00:40:22.962 --> 00:40:25.197
A massive distraction.

617
00:40:25.231 --> 00:40:27.933
You can't run from the truth,
but you certainly can drown it.


618
00:40:27.967 --> 00:40:30.102
- Drown it?
- In whisky.


619
00:40:30.136 --> 00:40:32.138
Or tequila.
Your prerogative.


620
00:40:33.873 --> 00:40:36.709
Where are we
gonna find a party?


621
00:40:36.742 --> 00:40:38.911
Say your dad
was going out tonight...


622
00:40:40.179 --> 00:40:42.081
Oh!

623
00:40:42.915 --> 00:40:44.450
I'll make some calls.

624
00:41:19.218 --> 00:41:22.321
Would you like to hear
about our little scheme?


625
00:41:22.354 --> 00:41:24.390
I've been waiting
for about an hour.


626
00:41:24.423 --> 00:41:26.058
It takes those two
longer to get dressed,


627
00:41:26.091 --> 00:41:28.260
than it took Ms. Tran
to bleach my asshole.


628
00:41:28.294 --> 00:41:31.197
'Course, my asshole hair
is so fine that it really


629
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:33.933
doesn't take that long,
but it sure stings a lot.


630
00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:38.237
Well, the Bens are going to
infiltrate the party


631
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:41.473
dressed as douchebags,
so they will transform


632
00:41:41.507 --> 00:41:44.877
from bodyguard Bens
to frat boy Kens.


633
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.146
Watch the rhyming, son.
That's my gig.


634
00:41:47.179 --> 00:41:50.816
Don't be mad, Dad,
even a tad.


635
00:41:50.849 --> 00:41:52.985
I'm the poet in this family.

636
00:41:53.018 --> 00:41:57.122
<i>♪ Chocolate raisins in the sky
if everybody starts to cry ♪</i>


637
00:41:57.156 --> 00:42:00.226
I wrote that and it won
a fucking Grammy, so suck it.


638
00:42:00.259 --> 00:42:03.162
Oh,
you're out of massage oils.


639
00:42:03.195 --> 00:42:05.130
Weren't you the scientist lady?

640
00:42:05.164 --> 00:42:07.066
Yes, so Natalia's
my girlfriend now.


641
00:42:07.099 --> 00:42:12.171
Mm-hmm! Muah.
Wah, ooh wah, wah, coo.


642
00:42:14.206 --> 00:42:16.875
That's nice, just a tad
surprised how she went


643
00:42:16.909 --> 00:42:19.211
from MIT meek
to strip club chic.


644
00:42:19.245 --> 00:42:20.379
Rhyming!

645
00:42:22.281 --> 00:42:24.250
There is literally
zero massage oil.


646
00:42:25.918 --> 00:42:28.420
Kostya.
It's Natalia's brother.


647
00:42:37.129 --> 00:42:40.466
Apparently,
Russia is a very sexy place.


648
00:42:40.499 --> 00:42:43.469
I like the way you talk.
Would you like orgy?


649
00:42:43.502 --> 00:42:45.404
No, no,
Bobby Q doesn't orgy.


650
00:42:45.437 --> 00:42:48.007
He watches
my back while I orgy.


651
00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.242
Mmm...

652
00:42:50.276 --> 00:42:52.945
Now let's
get this wildly erotic,


653
00:42:52.978 --> 00:42:57.449
deeply taboo, and possibly
illegal game play underway.


654
00:42:58.851 --> 00:43:01.920
Oh, oh, oh oh.

655
00:43:02.154 --> 00:43:04.089
Hey... oh!

656
00:43:04.123 --> 00:43:06.992
This sort of thing can
emotionally scar a poor boy.


657
00:43:07.026 --> 00:43:10.296
- Oh, man.
- I've got oil in my bedroom.


658
00:43:13.632 --> 00:43:15.467
Kids, why don't you
wait in daddy's room?


659
00:43:15.501 --> 00:43:17.202
He has a little
business to attend to.


660
00:43:17.236 --> 00:43:19.171
Okay, daddy.

661
00:43:19.204 --> 00:43:22.308
Ah, so the incestuous Russian
sex toys get to call you daddy.


662
00:43:22.341 --> 00:43:25.444
Grow the fuck up.
That's rock and roll.


663
00:43:25.477 --> 00:43:27.513
You need to worry
about those Ben idiots


664
00:43:27.546 --> 00:43:30.316
- covering that Nathan kid.
- Fret not.


665
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:32.384
They'll keep a close eye
on him at the party.


666
00:43:32.418 --> 00:43:36.221
It might be advantageous
to bring him into the fold.


667
00:43:36.723 --> 00:43:40.592
I see your point.
Okay. Shoot your shot.


668
00:43:40.626 --> 00:43:42.261
But if he doesn't go
along with it,


669
00:43:42.294 --> 00:43:44.897
shoot your shot for real.

670
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:46.598
You get what I'm saying?

671
00:43:46.632 --> 00:43:48.233
Yes.

672
00:43:48.267 --> 00:43:50.969
Do you really
know what I'm saying?


673
00:43:51.003 --> 00:43:53.405
If I ask
and he says no,


674
00:43:53.439 --> 00:43:58.243
I should ask again with
a very intimidating manner.


675
00:43:58.277 --> 00:44:02.181
If you ask and he says no,
you should kill him.


676
00:44:02.214 --> 00:44:04.083
- Really?
- Dead.


677
00:44:04.583 --> 00:44:07.353
Wow, quite the extreme
measures to be taken,


678
00:44:08.053 --> 00:44:09.421
but I'm on it.

679
00:44:09.455 --> 00:44:12.424
In fact,
I'm quite prepared.


680
00:44:12.458 --> 00:44:14.893
I'll be the man for the job.

681
00:44:16.028 --> 00:44:17.563
That's not a gun.

682
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:20.165
That's a gun, son.

683
00:44:21.133 --> 00:44:22.501
We're trying to kill him,

684
00:44:22.534 --> 00:44:24.436
not tickle his balls.

685
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:26.372
Yes, good god.

686
00:44:26.405 --> 00:44:28.173
Well...
Very well, then.


687
00:44:28.207 --> 00:44:31.009
Okay, I'll just put
that back there for now.


688
00:44:33.713 --> 00:44:35.681
What do you think
about this, Bobby?


689
00:44:35.715 --> 00:44:37.983
Orwell's right.
We're looking good.


690
00:44:38.016 --> 00:44:40.486
We've harvested more
of the horse product.


691
00:44:40.519 --> 00:44:42.254
Setting up
bidders online.


692
00:44:42.287 --> 00:44:45.991
By this time next week,
you'll be richer than sin.


693
00:44:46.592 --> 00:44:48.994
Ah, yeah.
Wanna do a bump?


694
00:44:49.027 --> 00:44:51.930
No, thanks.
I don't do the cocaine.


695
00:44:51.964 --> 00:44:54.266
This ain't cocaine.
This is vitamin B12.


696
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:06.512
Ah, fuck Viagra.

697
00:45:06.545 --> 00:45:10.015
That shit gets you harder
than Portuguese trigonometry.


698
00:45:10.048 --> 00:45:13.018
Grease up, kids.
Daddy's coming.


699
00:45:13.051 --> 00:45:14.420
Later, Bobby.

700
00:45:14.453 --> 00:45:16.488
Oh, man...

701
00:45:16.522 --> 00:45:21.193
that is one seriously psycho,
freaky-deaky rock star.


702
00:45:42.214 --> 00:45:43.582
Bottoms up.

703
00:45:47.119 --> 00:45:49.021
Oh, my god.

704
00:45:49.288 --> 00:45:50.723
Is that nail polish remover?

705
00:45:50.757 --> 00:45:52.257
No,
just shitty moonshine.


706
00:45:52.291 --> 00:45:54.026
Shitty being
the operative word.


707
00:45:54.526 --> 00:45:57.095
Party's arrived.

708
00:45:57.129 --> 00:46:00.332
Absolutely not.
Who the fuck invited you?


709
00:46:00.365 --> 00:46:02.735
Well, it's a party. Of course
Chaz is going to be here.


710
00:46:02.769 --> 00:46:06.338
Baby...
Hey, I want you back.


711
00:46:07.673 --> 00:46:10.509
Chaz... this may come
as a surprise to you,


712
00:46:10.542 --> 00:46:12.177
but I don't want you back.

713
00:46:12.211 --> 00:46:16.215
But as my dad always says,
I'm the best.


714
00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:19.518
Yeah, look at that girl over
there: she's pining after me.


715
00:46:19.551 --> 00:46:22.020
Nah, man, I'm good.
I'm actually gay.


716
00:46:22.054 --> 00:46:23.589
Yes, she is,
twinkle toes.


717
00:46:23.622 --> 00:46:26.793
A bad example because she
doesn't even like guys.


718
00:46:26.826 --> 00:46:28.660
I like guys
and I would never do you.


719
00:46:28.694 --> 00:46:30.596
And I would never
even date you either,


720
00:46:30.629 --> 00:46:33.265
because I have a strict
no redheads policy.


721
00:46:34.099 --> 00:46:36.034
- Dude, she's blonde.
- Wait, she's what?


722
00:46:38.403 --> 00:46:40.105
Whatever.

723
00:46:40.138 --> 00:46:41.774
Look, Chaz, the reason no
one wants to date you


724
00:46:41.808 --> 00:46:43.776
is because
you're a massive twat.


725
00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:45.712
But I have a maid.

726
00:46:46.345 --> 00:46:47.714
Precisely.

727
00:46:50.682 --> 00:46:53.552
Okay, this party's pathetic.
Let's bounce.


728
00:46:55.788 --> 00:46:58.524
I don't, I don't even know why
I dated you in the first place.


729
00:46:58.557 --> 00:47:01.260
You're not exactly
Soho House material.


730
00:47:01.293 --> 00:47:03.095
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?


731
00:47:03.128 --> 00:47:05.163
That I momentarily
let my standards drop


732
00:47:05.197 --> 00:47:07.499
- when I dated you.
- You can fuck off, Chaz.


733
00:47:14.373 --> 00:47:16.108
Always such a dick.

734
00:47:16.141 --> 00:47:17.777
I don't know why
I let him get under my skin.


735
00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:19.645
- Cha-Chaz.
- What?


736
00:47:19.678 --> 00:47:21.346
I, I'd date you.

737
00:47:22.414 --> 00:47:25.183
- Really?
- Yeah.


738
00:47:25.217 --> 00:47:26.552
Thanks, Zac.
That means a lot.


739
00:47:26.585 --> 00:47:28.353
They were totally
wrong about you.


740
00:47:28.387 --> 00:47:29.856
- They were.
- Yeah.


741
00:47:29.889 --> 00:47:31.724
- I'm hot, huh?
- Totally.


742
00:47:33.158 --> 00:47:35.327
Remember,
blue is the warmest colour.


743
00:47:35.929 --> 00:47:37.663
You know what
you remind me of?


744
00:47:37.696 --> 00:47:39.164
- What?
- Myself.


745
00:47:52.377 --> 00:47:55.581
Hey, miss.
Would you like some free drugs?


746
00:47:55.614 --> 00:47:57.649
- I'll take care of 'em.
- What?


747
00:47:57.683 --> 00:47:59.451
You have to be more casual.

748
00:48:04.891 --> 00:48:07.326
Looks like you need a refill.

749
00:48:07.659 --> 00:48:09.628
Aw, thanks.

750
00:48:13.498 --> 00:48:14.901
Your presence
has been summoned.


751
00:48:14.934 --> 00:48:16.535
What?

752
00:48:16.568 --> 00:48:18.738
He said your presence
has been summoned.


753
00:48:20.672 --> 00:48:23.542
- Do you have the wrong guy?
- You are the Nathan.


754
00:48:23.575 --> 00:48:25.177
Yeah?

755
00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:26.678
Guess you
do have the right guy.


756
00:48:26.713 --> 00:48:29.281
Then we shall see you tomorrow.

757
00:48:34.453 --> 00:48:35.654
No, thanks.

758
00:48:35.687 --> 00:48:37.656
Nathan, Nathan, Nathan.

759
00:48:37.689 --> 00:48:40.492
You'll want to come by.
We just want to talk.


760
00:48:41.159 --> 00:48:44.463
Remember, Nathan,
we know where you live.


761
00:48:44.496 --> 00:48:45.898
- Okay?
- Jesus.


762
00:49:05.384 --> 00:49:06.786
Watch where you're going.

763
00:49:27.506 --> 00:49:31.209
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.


764
00:49:31.243 --> 00:49:32.945
- I'm not mad.
- You're not?


765
00:49:32.979 --> 00:49:35.414
No,
I want you to have fun.


766
00:49:35.815 --> 00:49:38.450
Your being responsible doesn't
mean not having any fun.


767
00:49:39.251 --> 00:49:41.754
I want you to not
hate the fun, really.


768
00:49:42.755 --> 00:49:45.190
Kevin!
We missed you.


769
00:49:47.259 --> 00:49:48.694
Woah...

770
00:49:48.728 --> 00:49:51.329
- No, thank you.
- Probably for the best.


771
00:49:51.363 --> 00:49:53.498
Tastes like garbage.

772
00:49:53.532 --> 00:49:56.635
Well, uh,
you two enjoy yourselves.


773
00:49:58.637 --> 00:50:01.741
But... be ready
for work in the morning.


774
00:50:01.774 --> 00:50:03.442
Ay, ay, captain.

775
00:50:04.676 --> 00:50:05.912
Sweet.

776
00:50:19.792 --> 00:50:21.393
Good boy.

777
00:50:29.334 --> 00:50:31.938
What the fuck?
The lock is cut.


778
00:50:47.385 --> 00:50:48.888
Oh, you're up, uh, early.

779
00:50:49.354 --> 00:50:51.791
Yeah, I know there's work
to be done, and all that.


780
00:50:54.761 --> 00:50:55.862
So...

781
00:50:57.562 --> 00:50:59.331
...how was your date?

782
00:51:00.632 --> 00:51:03.602
No one, uh, no one
really compares to your mother.


783
00:51:06.438 --> 00:51:09.341
- What's with the papers?
- Oh, uh...


784
00:51:09.374 --> 00:51:11.576
I'm just looking over some
financial stuff.


785
00:51:12.377 --> 00:51:13.612
Oh.

786
00:51:15.047 --> 00:51:16.548
How's it looking?

787
00:51:17.884 --> 00:51:19.284
Not good.

788
00:51:20.119 --> 00:51:22.054
- I'm sorry about the baler...
- Hey, hey, hey.


789
00:51:22.088 --> 00:51:23.688
I know you are.

790
00:51:29.996 --> 00:51:31.731
Thanks, kiddo.

791
00:51:32.832 --> 00:51:35.034
Uh,
anything I can do to help?


792
00:51:35.634 --> 00:51:38.938
Not at the moment, unless you
have some that Adderall


793
00:51:38.971 --> 00:51:42.842
laying around that'd be...
hey, hey. That's a joke.


794
00:51:44.977 --> 00:51:47.445
But in the meantime,
the composter


795
00:51:47.479 --> 00:51:49.548
- could use turning over.
- No shit?


796
00:51:52.584 --> 00:51:53.920
No shit.

797
00:52:01.894 --> 00:52:05.731
- Hmm, hey, Loser.
- Oh, what are you guys doing?


798
00:52:06.265 --> 00:52:08.433
Just trying
to give Fritz a little lovin'.


799
00:52:08.466 --> 00:52:09.836
I don't know
what's going on with him.


800
00:52:09.869 --> 00:52:11.904
Poor little guy.

801
00:52:12.571 --> 00:52:13.973
Alright, Fritz.

802
00:52:14.439 --> 00:52:16.876
God, I'm so hungover.

803
00:52:16.909 --> 00:52:18.443
All I want
is Betty's pizza


804
00:52:18.476 --> 00:52:21.147
with that...
cheesy, yummy goodness.


805
00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:25.383
Uh, wanna like, go later?

806
00:52:25.617 --> 00:52:27.652
To Betty's?

807
00:52:27.686 --> 00:52:31.924
Yeah, I mean,
you said you wanted to go, so...


808
00:52:31.958 --> 00:52:35.393
Nathaniel, are you asking
me out on a date?


809
00:52:36.095 --> 00:52:39.932
If I were,
would you say yes?


810
00:52:40.665 --> 00:52:41.767
Mm-hmm.

811
00:52:42.201 --> 00:52:44.804
- Betty's then?
- It's a date, city boy.


812
00:52:44.837 --> 00:52:47.106
Two losers.

813
00:52:52.044 --> 00:52:53.678
Yes.

814
00:53:40.026 --> 00:53:42.161
It's beautiful.

815
00:53:45.898 --> 00:53:47.199
Excellent.

816
00:53:47.233 --> 00:53:49.835
100 percent Grade A.

817
00:54:00.112 --> 00:54:01.579
Hello?

818
00:54:03.581 --> 00:54:05.718
Someone is waiting,
you imbecile.


819
00:54:07.787 --> 00:54:09.755
And change your shirt,
as we discussed.


820
00:54:12.758 --> 00:54:15.761
Welcome to the smoke shop.
That's all we sell here.


821
00:54:16.228 --> 00:54:18.530
We're chill people.
Come on in.


822
00:54:20.166 --> 00:54:22.168
- Come on, bro. Come on.
- Okay.


823
00:54:29.709 --> 00:54:31.077
Sick shop.

824
00:54:32.178 --> 00:54:34.646
Oh, you haven't
seen anything yet.


825
00:54:36.949 --> 00:54:38.516
I'm not going
to kiss your hand.


826
00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:39.919
Come with me.

827
00:54:39.952 --> 00:54:42.520
Scared to take my hand?

828
00:54:43.555 --> 00:54:44.991
I'm allergic to latex.

829
00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:48.728
Hm. Must be convenient...
for a virgin.


830
00:54:48.761 --> 00:54:50.830
I'm not a vir...

831
00:54:51.964 --> 00:54:55.034
Shit. Lotta cash.

832
00:54:56.634 --> 00:54:58.204
Oh, this doesn't exist.

833
00:54:59.872 --> 00:55:01.107
I...

834
00:55:01.874 --> 00:55:05.610
- It's right there.
- None of this is real.


835
00:55:05.643 --> 00:55:08.247
Ben, you are an utter
embarrassment.


836
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.783
Nathaniel,
pay him no mind.


837
00:55:10.816 --> 00:55:12.818
I believe he was dropped
on his head as a child.


838
00:55:14.787 --> 00:55:17.689
Perhaps on multiple occasions.

839
00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:21.927
Come with me,
my boy, please.


840
00:55:21.961 --> 00:55:24.864
- Oh, my god.
- Ooh, you have soft shoulders.


841
00:55:25.297 --> 00:55:28.000
I, I don't, yeah.

842
00:55:35.141 --> 00:55:36.776
What are those?

843
00:55:36.809 --> 00:55:40.780
Liquid gold, my boy.
Liquid gold.


844
00:55:40.813 --> 00:55:45.117
Mined from the shaft
with my bare hands.


845
00:55:45.151 --> 00:55:47.019
What's liquid gold?

846
00:55:47.053 --> 00:55:48.754
Horse semen
is no laughing matter.


847
00:55:48.788 --> 00:55:50.688
You're seriously the worst.

848
00:55:54.193 --> 00:55:56.862
- What's in there?
- 69, 69.


849
00:55:56.896 --> 00:55:58.297
That's the code
that he assigned.


850
00:55:58.898 --> 00:56:02.201
69, 69. That's the code
that he assigned.


851
00:56:02.234 --> 00:56:05.271
Enough of your
childish rhymes, Ben.


852
00:56:05.304 --> 00:56:06.839
Okay...

853
00:56:08.274 --> 00:56:11.077
Just uh, joking with our
house comic Ben, here.


854
00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:12.644
Where do you think
you're going?


855
00:56:12.677 --> 00:56:13.979
I have plans.

856
00:56:14.447 --> 00:56:16.949
We all know it's a date.
You can say it.


857
00:56:18.884 --> 00:56:20.920
Look, I don't know what kind
of weird ass operation


858
00:56:20.953 --> 00:56:23.688
- you have going on here...
- Weird ass?


859
00:56:24.023 --> 00:56:26.025
It's actually an incredible,
wonderful operation


860
00:56:26.058 --> 00:56:28.127
we're running here.
We were going to invite you


861
00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:30.296
to join,
but never mind.


862
00:56:30.529 --> 00:56:32.264
Well, I definitely
don't want any part of it.


863
00:56:32.298 --> 00:56:33.933
We definitely don't
want any part of you.


864
00:56:33.966 --> 00:56:35.835
- Well, then we're in agreement.
- Fine.


865
00:56:35.868 --> 00:56:37.236
Oh!

866
00:56:37.269 --> 00:56:38.871
Say hello
to your horsey friend for us.


867
00:56:38.904 --> 00:56:41.240
I'm gonna...

868
00:56:41.606 --> 00:56:44.076
- Okay.
- Yeah, I'm sorry, bro.


869
00:56:49.748 --> 00:56:52.318
Have a wonderful date,
Nate.


870
00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:02.394
Spare key. Hmm.

871
00:57:03.295 --> 00:57:05.164
Hmm...

872
00:57:09.368 --> 00:57:11.804
See, it doesn't work with Coke.
It has to be a milkshake.


873
00:57:11.837 --> 00:57:14.406
- Well, I'm lactose intolerant.
- God, that's hot.


874
00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:16.709
What,
that I'm lactose intolerant?


875
00:57:16.742 --> 00:57:18.344
Say it again.

876
00:57:19.912 --> 00:57:21.147
I'm lactose intolerant.

877
00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:23.648
Fuck.

878
00:57:25.084 --> 00:57:26.318
I, um...

879
00:57:26.986 --> 00:57:30.089
Hey do you know a guy named...
what's his name,


880
00:57:30.823 --> 00:57:32.091
Orwell?

881
00:57:33.025 --> 00:57:34.793
Doesn't ring a bell.

882
00:57:34.827 --> 00:57:38.230
He has these um,
Ring Pops on his hand.


883
00:57:39.365 --> 00:57:41.000
He tried to make me suck it.

884
00:57:41.033 --> 00:57:43.102
What?

885
00:57:43.135 --> 00:57:46.005
- His Ring Pop.
- Oh, oh, okay.


886
00:57:47.806 --> 00:57:50.309
Not, not his penis.

887
00:57:50.342 --> 00:57:53.445
- I just wanna make that clear.
- Noted.


888
00:57:55.281 --> 00:57:57.682
Hey,
are you cool with my dad?


889
00:57:58.384 --> 00:57:59.785
Yeah, why?

890
00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.888
I don't know,
he just gets on me a lot.


891
00:58:03.455 --> 00:58:05.958
Well, yeah, you don't know
what the fuck you're doing.


892
00:58:06.892 --> 00:58:10.796
Yeah, my life's kind of,
kind of messed up.


893
00:58:10.829 --> 00:58:14.200
Well, I just meant at the farm.
I didn't mean...


894
00:58:14.233 --> 00:58:16.235
Oh.

895
00:58:17.536 --> 00:58:19.138
Yeah, still.

896
00:58:19.572 --> 00:58:22.041
You should try to hang out with
him. He's pretty chill.


897
00:58:23.842 --> 00:58:25.477
I kind of feel
bad for that baler.


898
00:58:26.979 --> 00:58:28.314
Yeah, that was pretty bad.

899
00:58:30.983 --> 00:58:32.484
You saw
my muscles though, right?


900
00:58:33.219 --> 00:58:35.087
Your... muscles?

901
00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.489
Yeah, those.

902
00:58:37.823 --> 00:58:39.959
Those I saw.

903
00:58:39.992 --> 00:58:42.161
- Are you cold?
- A little bit.


904
00:58:45.965 --> 00:58:49.001
Well, well, well,
what the frick do we have here?


905
00:58:49.034 --> 00:58:50.469
Yo, Chaz.

906
00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:52.905
Don't you "Yo, Chaz" me,

907
00:58:52.938 --> 00:58:54.206
and get your hands
away from my girl.


908
00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:56.342
- Your girl?
- Yeah, get him, Chaz.


909
00:58:56.375 --> 00:58:59.111
- Oh, I will.
- So you're spying on me now?


910
00:58:59.144 --> 00:59:00.546
I came to serenade you.

911
00:59:00.579 --> 00:59:02.881
No one wants to hear that.
Let's go.


912
00:59:03.382 --> 00:59:05.517
Okay, so you're ditching me
for the Virgin Mary now?


913
00:59:05.551 --> 00:59:08.187
- Chaz, you're pathetic.
- Look, baby girl, baby girl.


914
00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:10.289
Look, you could be
making sweet, sweet love


915
00:59:10.322 --> 00:59:12.191
- to a Gucci model right now.
- Yeah, right.


916
00:59:12.224 --> 00:59:14.893
Yeah, that's right. I got paid
for a Gucci shoot next week.


917
00:59:15.361 --> 00:59:18.063
I'm going to be making bank.
Gucci bank.


918
00:59:18.097 --> 00:59:19.231
Good for you, Chaz.

919
00:59:19.832 --> 00:59:22.001
What...
Sarah, we make sense together.


920
00:59:22.434 --> 00:59:24.937
No, we really, really don't.

921
00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:26.305
Baby, please.

922
00:59:26.338 --> 00:59:28.941
- I wrote you this song.
- Oh, my God...


923
00:59:28.974 --> 00:59:33.912
<i>♪ Sarah,
I know it's hard. ♪</i>


924
00:59:33.946 --> 00:59:38.517
<i>♪ When I'm looking
at you so very hard. ♪</i>


925
00:59:38.884 --> 00:59:41.887
<i>♪ When you cook me
breakfast, I've ♪</i>


926
00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:43.822
What, I was
about to hit the chorus, dude.


927
00:59:43.856 --> 00:59:46.091
- You'll sing it for me later.
- Uh, thanks for the song,


928
00:59:46.125 --> 00:59:48.260
but we're going to
get out of here, so...


929
00:59:48.294 --> 00:59:50.462
Sarah and I have a destiny.
She's mine.


930
00:59:50.496 --> 00:59:52.264
I don't belong to anyone.

931
00:59:52.298 --> 00:59:54.033
Yeah, what are you,
Ted Bundy or something?


932
00:59:54.667 --> 00:59:57.569
Okay, you want a fight?
Fine. You got one.


933
00:59:57.603 --> 00:59:59.471
- Take the first swing.
- I don't want to fight.


934
00:59:59.505 --> 01:00:01.273
You're just
a little bitch just like


935
01:00:01.307 --> 01:00:02.841
- your dad and your grandpa.
- Hey!


936
01:00:02.875 --> 01:00:04.243
- What did you say?
- Yeah, that's right.


937
01:00:04.276 --> 01:00:06.278
Your gamblin' ass
grandpa couldn't hold on


938
01:00:06.312 --> 01:00:08.447
to the farm,
and neither will your daddy.


939
01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.815
What are you talking about?

940
01:00:10.282 --> 01:00:12.017
Oh, you don't know,
do you?


941
01:00:12.351 --> 01:00:14.920
My dad just got a call
from developers today.


942
01:00:14.953 --> 01:00:17.056
They want to buy
the farm and tear it down.


943
01:00:17.089 --> 01:00:19.091
- Wait, what?
- Yeah, that's right.


944
01:00:19.558 --> 01:00:21.560
My dad's
meeting with them tomorrow.


945
01:00:24.196 --> 01:00:27.399
So listen, if your dad can come
up with the cash before then...


946
01:00:29.368 --> 01:00:33.138
Oh, oh did I make you upset?
He's just a little bi...


947
01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.374
- Chaz! No!
- I'm okay.


948
01:00:35.407 --> 01:00:37.443
Oh, my god, I think
I got a rock in my eye.


949
01:00:37.476 --> 01:00:39.545
Can you look in my eye?
It's really,


950
01:00:39.578 --> 01:00:42.081
- I don't think it's... ah!
- The fuck!?


951
01:00:42.114 --> 01:00:44.083
What am I gonna
do with my Insta story?


952
01:00:47.553 --> 01:00:49.555
God, he's such an asshole.

953
01:00:51.657 --> 01:00:52.925
Yeah.

954
01:00:54.159 --> 01:00:55.594
He never deserved you.

955
01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.636
- I really like you, Sarah.
- Oh, yeah?


956
01:01:06.372 --> 01:01:08.073
I like you, too.

957
01:01:11.543 --> 01:01:13.645
When are we going
to do about the farm?


958
01:01:13.679 --> 01:01:15.147
I don't know.

959
01:01:16.148 --> 01:01:17.449
I can speak to my dad.

960
01:01:20.452 --> 01:01:23.188
Woah, kiddo. You okay?

961
01:01:23.222 --> 01:01:25.557
Speak of the devil.

962
01:01:25.591 --> 01:01:27.359
Yeah, I'm okay.

963
01:01:27.393 --> 01:01:30.562
What, uh, what happened
to your nose?


964
01:01:30.963 --> 01:01:32.965
Got hit by
a wannabe Gucci model.


965
01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.568
Are you
uh, care to elaborate?


966
01:01:37.169 --> 01:01:39.238
Not really.

967
01:01:39.806 --> 01:01:41.673
I'm going to
go grab some air.


968
01:01:49.548 --> 01:01:52.151
What really
happened to your nose?


969
01:01:52.484 --> 01:01:53.585
You're stupid.

970
01:01:57.022 --> 01:02:00.659
Dad, I got to know the truth
about the farm, about grandpa.


971
01:02:03.328 --> 01:02:05.197
Your grandfather
was a, was a complicated guy.


972
01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:07.232
Then it's true,
he was a gambler.


973
01:02:12.204 --> 01:02:13.639
It was a secret.

974
01:02:13.939 --> 01:02:17.676
It was a big secret, really.

975
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:21.079
He, uh,
He had an addiction.


976
01:02:21.113 --> 01:02:25.384
And one night
he lost a huge bet.


977
01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:28.053
And he didn't have
the cash to cover it.


978
01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:32.725
- So he had to give up the farm.
- You can't be serious.


979
01:02:33.225 --> 01:02:37.162
Before he died, he made
me promise him that...


980
01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:39.531
I'd buy the farm back.

981
01:02:40.232 --> 01:02:43.736
So, uh...
that's what I have been doing.


982
01:02:44.236 --> 01:02:47.139
Slowly paying it off
over the past few years.


983
01:02:47.606 --> 01:02:51.009
- That's why you left mom and I.
- Yeah.


984
01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:53.612
Why didn't you say so?

985
01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:55.514
I didn't want to hurt
your grandfather's pride.


986
01:02:55.547 --> 01:02:57.149
So why tell me now?

987
01:02:59.251 --> 01:03:01.220
Because...

988
01:03:01.788 --> 01:03:04.623
I thought it was more important
to tell the truth.


989
01:03:06.191 --> 01:03:08.093
Dad, you're gonna
lose the farm.


990
01:03:08.126 --> 01:03:10.062
Oh, hey, I mean, it's going
to be a little difficult to get


991
01:03:10.095 --> 01:03:12.197
- over the baler incident...
- No, developers are buying it.


992
01:03:12.631 --> 01:03:13.766
What?

993
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.267
Chaz told me.

994
01:03:15.935 --> 01:03:18.036
His dad's
meeting them tomorrow.


995
01:03:19.538 --> 01:03:21.340
And they're going to
tear it down.


996
01:03:23.375 --> 01:03:25.210
You know, if you would have
told me you're going to


997
01:03:25.244 --> 01:03:27.079
lose the farm a month ago
I wouldn't have cared.


998
01:03:27.112 --> 01:03:28.781
Shit, I'd probably be happy.

999
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:34.186
But now, I can't help to think
that this is entirely my fault.


1000
01:03:34.653 --> 01:03:36.421
I mean, if I wasn't so stupid
with the baler...


1001
01:03:36.455 --> 01:03:40.125
Kiddo, kiddo, kiddo,
slow, slow down.


1002
01:03:52.604 --> 01:03:53.840
What are you doing here?

1003
01:03:53.873 --> 01:03:55.541
Look at my
beautiful boy's face.


1004
01:03:55.742 --> 01:03:57.676
You need to get control
of that little shit of yours.


1005
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:59.578
- Alright John...
- How's he supposed to do his


1006
01:03:59.611 --> 01:04:02.681
- Gucci commercial next week?
- There he is, Dad.


1007
01:04:02.715 --> 01:04:04.550
You need to keep your
grubby little hands


1008
01:04:04.583 --> 01:04:06.385
off of my angel,
you hear me?


1009
01:04:06.418 --> 01:04:08.687
Alright, I think the name
calling is a bit excessive.


1010
01:04:08.721 --> 01:04:11.223
You know, your son is going
to end up just like you.


1011
01:04:11.256 --> 01:04:15.160
Broke, alone, and at the bottom
of the food chain.


1012
01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:18.831
No, I think it's time that you
get the fuck off my property.


1013
01:04:18.865 --> 01:04:20.566
- Your property?
- Yeah.


1014
01:04:20.599 --> 01:04:21.667
Ha...

1015
01:04:22.367 --> 01:04:24.069
You're not going
to get away with this.


1016
01:04:25.805 --> 01:04:28.307
Oh, I will.
I will.


1017
01:04:28.775 --> 01:04:30.442
He will.

1018
01:04:32.912 --> 01:04:34.781
Dad,
can you unlock the door?


1019
01:04:44.489 --> 01:04:47.659
God. There must be something
we're not thinking of.


1020
01:04:48.527 --> 01:04:50.797
Well, I'm all out of ideas.

1021
01:04:57.804 --> 01:04:59.638
Well, you clean up nice.

1022
01:04:59.671 --> 01:05:02.240
What? Oh, thanks.

1023
01:05:02.274 --> 01:05:04.209
Felt like a new shirt
would make me feel better.


1024
01:05:04.242 --> 01:05:06.478
I was really talking about
the bloodless face, but...


1025
01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:07.847
Ah, yeah.
That, too.


1026
01:05:09.281 --> 01:05:11.617
Woah, this is chill.

1027
01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:13.452
It's my favorite spot,
but I hardly ever


1028
01:05:13.485 --> 01:05:15.487
get down here because
I'm always so busy at the farm.


1029
01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.222
Well,
I definitely need the break.


1030
01:05:17.255 --> 01:05:18.590
I don't know
what's gonna happen...


1031
01:05:18.624 --> 01:05:20.292
No, no, no, no, no.
Tomorrow.


1032
01:05:20.325 --> 01:05:21.828
Tonight, we chill.

1033
01:05:22.361 --> 01:05:24.296
I know, right?
Check this out.


1034
01:05:24.329 --> 01:05:26.164
I was attacked by a bear.

1035
01:05:26.198 --> 01:05:28.835
Where was Zac
when I needed him? Huh, Zac?


1036
01:05:29.635 --> 01:05:32.604
Ugh, he's everywhere.
Let's just go down to the dock.


1037
01:05:35.775 --> 01:05:38.176
Put that away, it's gross.

1038
01:05:38.543 --> 01:05:40.780
What? It's just my dick.

1039
01:05:42.247 --> 01:05:45.250
- You okay?
- Yeah, sorry, he's just so...


1040
01:05:45.283 --> 01:05:48.153
goddamn annoying.
Thanks.


1041
01:05:49.655 --> 01:05:51.556
I'm really
sorry about the fight.


1042
01:05:51.590 --> 01:05:52.925
Yeah.

1043
01:05:57.329 --> 01:05:59.866
Hey, you like my dick, right?

1044
01:06:02.401 --> 01:06:05.872
It, uh...
was actually my birthday,


1045
01:06:06.605 --> 01:06:09.241
and we're supposed to have
a date that night,


1046
01:06:09.274 --> 01:06:12.344
but I guess he just...
forgot.


1047
01:06:12.377 --> 01:06:14.613
- Hey, birthday girl.
- Hey.


1048
01:06:15.347 --> 01:06:18.550
- Where's Chaz?
- Uh, he had to take care


1049
01:06:18.583 --> 01:06:21.219
of some business
for his dad.


1050
01:06:21.253 --> 01:06:22.722
He'll be here.

1051
01:06:22.755 --> 01:06:24.322
Uh huh.

1052
01:06:27.026 --> 01:06:30.395
Chaz. Hold on.
One second, Dad.


1053
01:06:30.763 --> 01:06:32.664
Chaz.

1054
01:06:33.432 --> 01:06:35.267
Are you drunk?

1055
01:06:35.735 --> 01:06:37.302
You're, you're not drunk?

1056
01:06:38.236 --> 01:06:39.972
Wait, wait, wait,
so let me get this straight.


1057
01:06:40.006 --> 01:06:43.776
You're calling me, on my
birthday, to tell me that


1058
01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:46.779
you just banged Missy
in the back of your car?


1059
01:06:47.947 --> 01:06:50.415
You know what?
Fuck you.


1060
01:06:55.487 --> 01:06:58.725
- You okay?
- Yeah, I just...


1061
01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:03.328
Hey, for the record,

1062
01:07:03.361 --> 01:07:04.764
no guy should ever treat
you like that.


1063
01:07:09.701 --> 01:07:12.637
Come on,
baby, you know I love you.


1064
01:07:12.671 --> 01:07:14.874
Oh, yeah right. Asshole.

1065
01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.777
I need a drink.

1066
01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:21.346
Hey just, ignore him.

1067
01:07:22.314 --> 01:07:23.615
Enjoy the high.

1068
01:07:26.384 --> 01:07:27.820
Thanks, Cowboy.

1069
01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:30.723
Cowboy? Really?

1070
01:07:33.558 --> 01:07:35.460
Can't help it, I'm sorry.

1071
01:07:40.365 --> 01:07:43.836
I guess this could really
be the end of my dad's farm.


1072
01:07:46.638 --> 01:07:47.974
Yeah.

1073
01:07:50.076 --> 01:07:51.643
Could be.

1074
01:08:00.753 --> 01:08:03.622
<i>Liquid gold, my boy.</i>

1075
01:08:03.655 --> 01:08:07.425
<i>Minded from the shaft...</i>

1076
01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.562
<i>Horse semen is not
a laughing matter.</i>


1077
01:08:10.595 --> 01:08:13.398
<i>The answer's in the semen.</i>

1078
01:08:17.770 --> 01:08:20.405
Oh, my God. Of course.

1079
01:08:20.438 --> 01:08:22.340
The answer's
always in the semen.


1080
01:08:26.478 --> 01:08:29.314
- The semen, that's it!
- Nate, are you alright?


1081
01:08:30.116 --> 01:08:32.384
For the first time in my life,
I've concocted a scheme


1082
01:08:32.417 --> 01:08:34.120
that's
not entirely self-serving.


1083
01:08:34.153 --> 01:08:36.923
When my dad left, I thought he
was a bad guy, but he wasn't.


1084
01:08:36.956 --> 01:08:39.424
He was trying to do
what he thought was right.


1085
01:08:40.026 --> 01:08:42.527
And I've come to realize that
it's not about being perfect,


1086
01:08:42.561 --> 01:08:44.997
it's about getting up every day
and at least fucking trying.


1087
01:08:46.565 --> 01:08:48.400
I'm not gonna lie to you,
I have no clue


1088
01:08:48.433 --> 01:08:49.769
if this plan is going to work.

1089
01:08:50.102 --> 01:08:52.470
It may very
well end up in flames.


1090
01:08:53.172 --> 01:08:54.472
But at least
we did something.


1091
01:08:55.274 --> 01:08:57.609
Well, I guess they can't blame
us for fucking trying.


1092
01:08:59.045 --> 01:09:00.512
Yep, here we go.

1093
01:09:09.021 --> 01:09:11.690
Shit,
it's right there.


1094
01:09:11.724 --> 01:09:13.893
I think I saw a side door.

1095
01:09:14.193 --> 01:09:15.928
I think you're right.

1096
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:20.099
Oh, you're right.

1097
01:09:26.806 --> 01:09:28.506
Well, that was too easy.

1098
01:09:36.648 --> 01:09:38.617
I think the coast is clear.

1099
01:09:38.650 --> 01:09:41.620
Holy shit,
this place is too weird.


1100
01:09:41.653 --> 01:09:43.488
The cash is in the front.

1101
01:09:43.723 --> 01:09:45.091
Wait, wait, wait.

1102
01:09:45.925 --> 01:09:47.559
What the hell is that?

1103
01:09:47.592 --> 01:09:48.627
I don't know.

1104
01:09:49.762 --> 01:09:51.764
Looks like
it could be important.


1105
01:09:51.797 --> 01:09:53.900
Looks like it needs a code.

1106
01:09:53.933 --> 01:09:56.102
You're just full
of great tips, aren't you?


1107
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:59.604
Actually,
I think I know it.


1108
01:09:59.638 --> 01:10:01.406
How on earth would you know it?

1109
01:10:02.041 --> 01:10:05.111
Some people can be so smart,
yet so, so dumb.


1110
01:10:06.544 --> 01:10:08.848
69 69.

1111
01:10:11.717 --> 01:10:13.719
What the fuck?

1112
01:10:14.619 --> 01:10:16.655
I think I know what this.

1113
01:10:19.091 --> 01:10:20.826
Oh, Shit.

1114
01:10:22.594 --> 01:10:24.230
You got this, Judge.

1115
01:10:24.263 --> 01:10:26.631
It's good
thing we used extra oil.


1116
01:10:26.665 --> 01:10:29.902
Okay. This isn't
going to be easy.


1117
01:10:31.237 --> 01:10:33.505
Right foot blueberry.

1118
01:10:39.979 --> 01:10:42.181
Aw, shit.

1119
01:10:42.214 --> 01:10:43.749
Ah.

1120
01:10:45.718 --> 01:10:48.054
Fuck. Code red!

1121
01:10:48.087 --> 01:10:50.923
Code red!
Alert! Alert!


1122
01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:55.527
What is it?
Shit, is it my boyfriend?


1123
01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:57.229
Wait, you have boyfriend?

1124
01:10:57.430 --> 01:11:02.234
My top secret horse semen
lair has been compromised,


1125
01:11:02.701 --> 01:11:06.705
which means law enforcement
is probably on their way.


1126
01:11:07.106 --> 01:11:09.742
So let's get the fuck
out of here.


1127
01:11:12.610 --> 01:11:14.113
I got warrants.

1128
01:11:14.146 --> 01:11:15.915
So what do we do now, sis?

1129
01:11:15.948 --> 01:11:17.817
Drop the sister act.
It's gross.


1130
01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:19.651
- So...
- Okay, well, what he said.


1131
01:11:19.684 --> 01:11:21.887
- Let's get the fuck outta here.
- Okay.


1132
01:11:23.856 --> 01:11:25.791
Okay, you guys take off.

1133
01:11:25.825 --> 01:11:28.127
I'll meet you at the
Great Barrington Holiday Inn.


1134
01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.262
I got the mat.
You take the spiny thing.


1135
01:11:30.296 --> 01:11:31.897
Go. Go, go, go, go.

1136
01:11:34.566 --> 01:11:36.135
Are you going to be okay?

1137
01:11:36.168 --> 01:11:38.838
Well, I'm wanted by
the law and I'm dead broke.


1138
01:11:38.871 --> 01:11:41.273
But I've got a song in my heart
and the music in my soul.


1139
01:11:46.345 --> 01:11:51.183
So long suckers.
I also got... this.


1140
01:11:54.253 --> 01:11:59.091
Five million dollars
of illegal horse semen.


1141
01:12:00.326 --> 01:12:02.128
- I forgot my keys.
- Ooh.


1142
01:12:17.043 --> 01:12:18.643
Prius, right?

1143
01:12:19.378 --> 01:12:21.847
Yes.

1144
01:12:24.884 --> 01:12:26.584
Yes.

1145
01:12:28.788 --> 01:12:30.923
<i>Who dares steals</i>

1146
01:12:30.956 --> 01:12:33.658
<i>from my secret semen lair?</i>

1147
01:12:34.226 --> 01:12:36.195
- Shit, the cops, too?
- Okay, actually?


1148
01:12:36.228 --> 01:12:38.596
I don't know if we're going
to get murdered or end up


1149
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:40.132
in jail but I just wanted
to let you know,


1150
01:12:40.166 --> 01:12:42.101
I've had the best time
getting to know you.


1151
01:12:49.775 --> 01:12:51.944
Hope that's not the last time
I get to do that.


1152
01:12:51.977 --> 01:12:53.345
I have a feeling it won't be.

1153
01:12:53.379 --> 01:12:55.147
<i>We know you're in there.</i>

1154
01:12:55.181 --> 01:12:57.649
<i>Come out with your hands
above your heads.</i>


1155
01:12:57.682 --> 01:13:00.753
Fuck...
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.


1156
01:13:00.786 --> 01:13:03.621
- Nate, chill.
- Chill?


1157
01:13:03.655 --> 01:13:05.357
The police are outside and
there's a semen psycho in here


1158
01:13:05.391 --> 01:13:07.860
probably trying to kill us.
How am I supposed to chill?


1159
01:13:07.893 --> 01:13:09.995
So, don't hate me, but...

1160
01:13:10.029 --> 01:13:12.731
- I didn't trust your plan.
- Huh?


1161
01:13:12.765 --> 01:13:14.699
The police are sort
of our back up.


1162
01:13:17.069 --> 01:13:19.905
- You, you know them?
- Mm-hmm.


1163
01:13:20.339 --> 01:13:22.908
- We just go outside then, or...?
- Sure.


1164
01:13:25.711 --> 01:13:29.014
Alright, step out slowly with
your hands above your heads.


1165
01:13:29.048 --> 01:13:32.084
- Woah, what the fuck?
- Woah, woah. Stand down.


1166
01:13:32.451 --> 01:13:34.854
- Your stepmom's a cop?
- Oh, yeah.


1167
01:13:36.288 --> 01:13:38.791
- Can I put my hands down?
- Yes, you can.


1168
01:13:39.959 --> 01:13:41.994
- There they are.
- Freeze.


1169
01:13:42.027 --> 01:13:44.797
Those are the demons who tried
to steal my horse semen money.


1170
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:46.398
Come here.

1171
01:13:50.402 --> 01:13:53.839
So, you're the sick
guy with the semen lair.


1172
01:13:53.873 --> 01:13:55.774
Even if I were,
you couldn't prove it.


1173
01:13:55.808 --> 01:13:57.710
There's literally
so much semen...


1174
01:13:57.743 --> 01:14:01.080
But you can't tie us directly
to it. We are innocent.


1175
01:14:01.113 --> 01:14:04.250
Ow, ow! Ow, ow!

1176
01:14:04.283 --> 01:14:06.252
Bennett, Barnes,
raid the place.


1177
01:14:06.285 --> 01:14:08.154
Yeah, you can go.
You can go.


1178
01:14:08.187 --> 01:14:11.390
Please, please. You guys don't
know how hard this work is.


1179
01:14:11.423 --> 01:14:13.159
I mean, a horse
like Fritz is literally...


1180
01:14:13.192 --> 01:14:15.027
Wait, what did
you just say?


1181
01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:16.795
- I said a horse like Fritz is...
- That's my dad's horse.


1182
01:14:16.829 --> 01:14:18.364
That's why he's
been acting off.


1183
01:14:18.397 --> 01:14:20.900
Wait a minute.
You're telling me


1184
01:14:20.933 --> 01:14:23.102
that all your semen money...

1185
01:14:23.135 --> 01:14:24.870
comes from your horse?

1186
01:14:24.904 --> 01:14:27.139
Fritz's semen is liquid gold.
You would've done


1187
01:14:27.173 --> 01:14:29.175
the same thing.
We just thought of it first.


1188
01:14:30.342 --> 01:14:32.677
- You are despicable.
- Hmm!


1189
01:14:33.078 --> 01:14:35.714
And you three
are a creepy looking trio.


1190
01:14:37.016 --> 01:14:39.151
There is so much cash in there.

1191
01:14:39.652 --> 01:14:41.453
And
there's a lot of test tubes


1192
01:14:41.487 --> 01:14:43.422
full of
what's most likely semen.


1193
01:14:43.789 --> 01:14:46.158
- Cuff 'em.
- Hey, hey, hey.


1194
01:14:46.192 --> 01:14:48.761
What the fuck is this?
Hey!


1195
01:14:48.794 --> 01:14:53.232
Fuck you!
Oh, God!


1196
01:14:53.265 --> 01:14:55.134
- Oh, man!
- Nathaniel.


1197
01:14:55.167 --> 01:14:58.003
I bought you
a delicious Berkshire brew


1198
01:14:58.037 --> 01:15:01.207
from Berkshire Brewing Company,
established in 1994.


1199
01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:05.010
25 years family owned,
and this is how you repay me?


1200
01:15:05.044 --> 01:15:07.413
Listen, I am so sorry
this happened to your family.


1201
01:15:07.446 --> 01:15:09.515
But you know,
if it's any consolation,


1202
01:15:09.548 --> 01:15:12.985
theoretically, all that cash
belongs to your father.


1203
01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:16.121
Looks like your dad's
not losing the farm.


1204
01:15:16.722 --> 01:15:19.725
Well, it is his
liquid gold, after all.


1205
01:15:20.593 --> 01:15:22.895
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.


1206
01:15:22.928 --> 01:15:25.231
Don't worry.
Where you boys are going,


1207
01:15:25.264 --> 01:15:27.266
there's going
to be a lot of semen.


1208
01:15:27.967 --> 01:15:29.368
Yo, fuck you!

1209
01:15:39.311 --> 01:15:42.114
Oh, I'm sorry
about everything, Fritzy.


1210
01:15:42.147 --> 01:15:44.083
You're going to get so many
apples and carrots,


1211
01:15:44.116 --> 01:15:46.085
you won't even know
what to do about it.


1212
01:15:46.385 --> 01:15:48.887
- My lady.
- Oh, brother.


1213
01:15:48.921 --> 01:15:50.522
Thank you,
they're beautiful.


1214
01:15:51.090 --> 01:15:52.858
Don't ever
call me m'lady again.


1215
01:15:52.891 --> 01:15:54.126
Yeah, it felt wrong.
I definitely won't.


1216
01:15:54.159 --> 01:15:55.995
Ready for some country livin'?

1217
01:15:56.028 --> 01:15:58.264
I mean,
I have the boots.


1218
01:16:00.132 --> 01:16:01.800
Nice.

1219
01:16:04.069 --> 01:16:06.238
I still can't believe
you called for backup.


1220
01:16:06.272 --> 01:16:08.207
I admired your passion,
but this case


1221
01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.876
was a little too important
to leave it up to chance.


1222
01:16:10.909 --> 01:16:13.045
Chance?
I had a solid plan.


1223
01:16:13.078 --> 01:16:15.080
Oh, yeah, okay.
Solid.


1224
01:16:16.015 --> 01:16:18.050
I kissed you, didn't I?

1225
01:16:18.083 --> 01:16:19.818
You don't remember
kissing me?


1226
01:16:19.852 --> 01:16:22.554
I may have blacked
out for a moment.


1227
01:16:26.425 --> 01:16:28.093
Remember now?

1228
01:16:28.127 --> 01:16:31.330
I may need
one more to reminder.


1229
01:16:37.403 --> 01:16:40.105
I'm gonna be sick
