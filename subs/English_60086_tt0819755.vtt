1
00:02:34.238 --> 00:02:37.322
God watch over my daughter

2
00:02:41.488 --> 00:02:44.405
Keep her from the path of Sin

3
00:02:45.905 --> 00:02:49.488
Deliver her from the evil of Satan...

4
00:02:50.572 --> 00:02:53.029
and all his demons.

5
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.487
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen.


6
00:02:56.488 --> 00:02:58.947
Amen.

7
00:03:03.988 --> 00:03:07.197
I wish you didn't
have to go so far.


8
00:03:07.572 --> 00:03:09.529
Don't worry I'm gonna be fine.

9
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.405
It's just college.

10
00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:16.072
- I love you.
- Oh, I love you.


11
00:03:50.405 --> 00:03:53.363
All right, already, I'm comin'.

12
00:03:56.322 --> 00:03:58.654
- What?
- Erica?


13
00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:01.447
- Yeah.
- I'm Angie.


14
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.696
Your new roommate?

15
00:04:05.697 --> 00:04:10.322
Oh, hey. Oh, yeah.
OK, come on in.


16
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.279
I thought you were supposed
to be here tomorrow night.


17
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.987
Well, I'm pretty sure
I said the twenty-fourth.


18
00:04:17.988 --> 00:04:21.404
Doesn't matter. You're here now,
right? Here's the quick tour.


19
00:04:21.405 --> 00:04:24.572
Living room. Kitchen.

20
00:04:28.322 --> 00:04:30.737
Bedroom.

21
00:04:30.738 --> 00:04:33.905
My side. Your side.

22
00:04:34.072 --> 00:04:37.447
And we'll talk about
the closet later.


23
00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:42.612
Didn't you say in the email
that there was a bed?


24
00:04:42.613 --> 00:04:45.904
There was. However, the bitch
that lived here before you,


25
00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:49.404
decided last minute that she was gonna
take it, even though it wasn't hers.


26
00:04:49.405 --> 00:04:52.071
You'll have to crash on
the couch until you find one.


27
00:04:52.072 --> 00:04:53.987
I don't really have
money to buy one.


28
00:04:53.988 --> 00:04:57.530
We'll talk about it tomorrow, OK?

29
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.696
OK.

30
00:05:04.697 --> 00:05:07.613
The apartment is great. Mm-hm.

31
00:05:07.655 --> 00:05:09.404
My roommate?

32
00:05:09.405 --> 00:05:12.322
She's, she's really nice.

33
00:05:12.947 --> 00:05:16.072
No, I haven't had a
chance to look yet.


34
00:05:16.363 --> 00:05:20.655
I'm sure there's a church
close by here somewhere, yes.


35
00:05:20.697 --> 00:05:23.988
I promise.

36
00:05:25.572 --> 00:05:27.862
We have to go now

37
00:05:27.863 --> 00:05:31.072
Yeah, I love you too. Bye.

38
00:05:43.613 --> 00:05:45.321
Sorry.

39
00:05:45.322 --> 00:05:48.572
Should watch where I'm goin'.

40
00:05:48.697 --> 00:05:52.113
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. Excuse me.


41
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.405
Hail Mary full of grace.

42
00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:30.322
Be careful.

43
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.696
That's so sad.

44
00:07:35.697 --> 00:07:37.196
Yup.

45
00:07:37.197 --> 00:07:39.779
Table... Desk...

46
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.029
Motorcycle.

47
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.196
Sell your eggs.
Where are all the friggin' beds?


48
00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:45.904
What do you think happened to her?

49
00:07:45.905 --> 00:07:49.112
Who knows?
Last year, this girl went missing.


50
00:07:49.113 --> 00:07:51.654
Her mom was on the news,
the police did a full manhunt.


51
00:07:51.655 --> 00:07:55.404
Turns out she moved to Colorado with her
boyfriend and just didn't tell anyone.


52
00:07:55.405 --> 00:07:57.947
It happens all the time.

53
00:07:58.072 --> 00:08:02.654
Course, they did find some girl down
in Redding all hacked up last month.


54
00:08:02.655 --> 00:08:04.654
Did they ever catch the guy?

55
00:08:04.655 --> 00:08:07.446
I never heard anything
about it if they did.


56
00:08:07.447 --> 00:08:09.904
Not one fucking bed...
are you kidding me?


57
00:08:09.905 --> 00:08:13.363
Every time I come up here,
there's like a million of 'em.


58
00:08:14.613 --> 00:08:17.529
- You find one?
- No, it's for a job babysitting.


59
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.529
- That's a Montague area code.
- What does that mean?


60
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.737
It's out in farm country.
It's the boonies.


61
00:08:22.738 --> 00:08:25.654
Oh. Well, I'm gonna
check it out anyway.


62
00:08:25.655 --> 00:08:29.821
Suit yourself. There another one of these
boards on the other side of campus.


63
00:08:29.822 --> 00:08:32.655
Let's go see if
there's any beds on it.

64
00:08:40.655 --> 00:08:44.487
Now, here we have a painting
by Hans Aachen,


65
00:08:44.488 --> 00:08:48.029
entitled
"Saint George Slaying the Dragon".


66
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.737
Now, Saint George is the
patron saint of England,


67
00:08:51.738 --> 00:08:57.821
and is venerated throughout
Christendom for his example of bravery,


68
00:08:57.822 --> 00:09:00.362
in the defence of the poor
and the downtrodden.


69
00:09:00.363 --> 00:09:04.571
Keep in mind that during
this era of religious artistry,


70
00:09:04.572 --> 00:09:09.946
that dragons were not just
the mere machinations of evil


71
00:09:09.947 --> 00:09:12.487
derived from the minds
of simple village folk,


72
00:09:12.488 --> 00:09:18.237
but were in fact, symbolic
representations of the devil himself.


73
00:09:18.238 --> 00:09:23.321
In this particular picture,
Saint George slays the dragon.


74
00:09:23.322 --> 00:09:27.862
Once again, displaying
the classic archetype


75
00:09:27.863 --> 00:09:33.612
that good will defeat evil
and God will defeat... Satan.


76
00:09:33.613 --> 00:09:38.029
Good. Now, on to the works
of Evelyn Munyan.


77
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.362
Hi, I was calling about
the babysitting job.


78
00:09:40.363 --> 00:09:46.780
Seven-twenty-four Lancaster Road.

79
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.697
Got it.
OK. I'll see you in a few.


80
00:11:33.155 --> 00:11:36.780
Hey, there.
You must be Angie.


81
00:11:36.822 --> 00:11:39.321
- Angie, I'm Jim Stanton.
- Hi.


82
00:11:39.322 --> 00:11:42.487
We appreciate you coming out here.
Know what a long drive it is.


83
00:11:42.488 --> 00:11:45.738
Oh, it wasn't that bad.

84
00:11:47.197 --> 00:11:50.238
You made it.

85
00:11:51.363 --> 00:11:53.987
Hi. Violet Stanton.

86
00:11:53.988 --> 00:11:56.612
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.


87
00:11:56.613 --> 00:11:59.487
And this... must be Sam.

88
00:11:59.488 --> 00:12:02.737
He's a little shy at first, but
that's just till you get to know him.


89
00:12:02.738 --> 00:12:03.904
Isn't that right, Sam?

90
00:12:03.905 --> 00:12:06.029
That's quite a cowboy
outfit you have there.


91
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:10.112
Yeah, he never takes the thing off.
He even sleeps in it most nights.


92
00:12:10.113 --> 00:12:11.987
- Mm-hm.
- Really?


93
00:12:11.988 --> 00:12:15.155
Well, if I had a cool
cowboy hat like that,


94
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.237
I did the same thing
when I was his age.


95
00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:20.362
I had this ballerina outfit
I wore all the time.


96
00:12:20.363 --> 00:12:23.029
Oh, I love ballet.
Do you still dance?


97
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.404
Actually, I never danced.
I just liked to wear the outfit.


98
00:12:26.405 --> 00:12:27.946
Oh.

99
00:12:27.947 --> 00:12:31.946
So, um, on the phone, you said something
about needing a sitter for a gathering?


100
00:12:31.947 --> 00:12:35.279
Oh, yeah. Well, the gathering is when
all the local ranchers get together,


101
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.321
and help each other sort out
the new calves and brand 'em.


102
00:12:38.322 --> 00:12:41.154
- Then they get vaccinated and wormed.
- Oh, wow.


103
00:12:41.155 --> 00:12:44.654
We mostly work weekends, so that's when
we'd need you to watch Sam the most.


104
00:12:44.655 --> 00:12:46.237
That's perfect.

105
00:12:46.238 --> 00:12:48.404
You'll have to forgive
the disaster zone.


106
00:12:48.405 --> 00:12:51.821
We are under construction, as you
can see, so we're a little upside down.


107
00:12:51.822 --> 00:12:54.737
- Would you like some homemade lemonade?
- That'd be great.


108
00:12:54.738 --> 00:12:57.655
OK. Be right back.

109
00:13:01.863 --> 00:13:04.822
So, are you restoring
the entire house?


110
00:13:04.863 --> 00:13:07.404
Uh, one room at a time.

111
00:13:07.405 --> 00:13:10.529
I really didn't think
it was gonna be this much work.


112
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.821
Hm. How long have you been doing it?

113
00:13:12.822 --> 00:13:16.071
I thought we were gonna be finished
with the whole house in two months,


114
00:13:16.072 --> 00:13:22.237
but with plumbing and foundation, let's just
say we're going on just over a year now.


115
00:13:22.238 --> 00:13:23.904
- Wow.
- I know.


116
00:13:23.905 --> 00:13:24.987
Thank you.

117
00:13:24.988 --> 00:13:28.071
So, tell me a little bit
about yourself.


118
00:13:28.072 --> 00:13:32.612
I'm eighteen. I'm in my first year
at Adams Community College.


119
00:13:32.613 --> 00:13:34.446
Oh, great. What are you studying?

120
00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:37.487
- Art history.
- Nice. Where are you from?


121
00:13:37.488 --> 00:13:39.737
I just left Bakersfield
for the first time.


122
00:13:39.738 --> 00:13:42.821
Bakersfield. Don't they have a
community college in Bakersfield?


123
00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:47.987
Oh, yeah, they do. Um, but the art
history programme is better here.


124
00:13:47.988 --> 00:13:51.987
Really?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?


125
00:13:51.988 --> 00:13:53.487
No, just me and my mom.

126
00:13:53.488 --> 00:13:55.237
Mm.

127
00:13:55.238 --> 00:13:58.405
Hm.

128
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.737
- May I use your restroom?
- Oh, sure. Of course.


129
00:14:03.738 --> 00:14:08.072
The sink is broken in the one downstairs,
so use the one at the top of the stairs.


130
00:14:13.197 --> 00:14:14.821
I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

131
00:14:14.822 --> 00:14:18.738
No, not at all.
I just wasn't expecting...


132
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.362
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it's no problem.


133
00:14:21.363 --> 00:14:25.155
Hey, honey, you know where
those small bungees are?


134
00:14:35.613 --> 00:14:39.822
Get a grip, Ange.

135
00:14:48.988 --> 00:14:51.613
Hi, Sam.

136
00:14:56.363 --> 00:14:59.196
I think she's great.

137
00:14:59.197 --> 00:15:02.654
Oh, hi.
So, we have talked it over,


138
00:15:02.655 --> 00:15:06.737
and decided that we would love
for you to watch Sam on Friday night,


139
00:15:06.738 --> 00:15:09.279
- if that's OK with you.
- Yeah, Friday will be fine.


140
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.529
Terrific. I'd like to take my
beautiful wife out on the town


141
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:16.113
before things get a
little bit busy around here.


142
00:15:36.322 --> 00:15:37.821
Are you stalking me?

143
00:15:37.822 --> 00:15:40.571
- Excuse me?
- I'm the guy you ran into the other night.


144
00:15:40.572 --> 00:15:42.154
Oh. Hi.

145
00:15:42.155 --> 00:15:44.112
Looks like we're neighbours.

146
00:15:44.113 --> 00:15:47.696
I live in the building next door.
I'm Rick.


147
00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:48.779
Angie.

148
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.071
Nice to meet you, Angie.

149
00:15:50.072 --> 00:15:52.362
You, too.

150
00:15:52.363 --> 00:15:55.946
Hey, uh, maybe we could get
a bite to eat later or something.


151
00:15:55.947 --> 00:15:57.654
- I have to study.
- Ah.


152
00:15:57.655 --> 00:16:02.238
That's cool. I probably should, too.
Maybe some other time.


153
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.237
Hi.

154
00:16:18.238 --> 00:16:20.154
Hey!

155
00:16:20.155 --> 00:16:22.404
Angie, this is Hal.

156
00:16:22.405 --> 00:16:24.071
Yeah.

157
00:16:24.072 --> 00:16:25.321
It's nice to meet you.

158
00:16:25.322 --> 00:16:28.363
Have a seat.

159
00:16:32.488 --> 00:16:34.697
Hey, you want some?

160
00:16:34.738 --> 00:16:37.446
No. I'm OK, thank you.

161
00:16:37.447 --> 00:16:42.571
So, uh, you need a bed, huh?

162
00:16:42.572 --> 00:16:46.154
- Yeah.
- You can totally have mine.


163
00:16:46.155 --> 00:16:50.321
Absolutely.
It's like the coolest bed ever.


164
00:16:50.322 --> 00:16:53.197
- Really?
- Yeah.


165
00:16:53.238 --> 00:16:58.279
That bed has seen more action
than you could believe.


166
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.654
It's like good luck
or something like that.


167
00:17:01.655 --> 00:17:04.196
That's... That's great.

168
00:17:04.197 --> 00:17:10.696
You can come over to my place on
Saturday, and I'll help you move it.


169
00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:13.571
- Thank you.
- Yeah.


170
00:17:13.572 --> 00:17:18.821
- Oh. Who the...
- You dropped some on your shirt.


171
00:17:18.822 --> 00:17:23.154
Are you sure you don't want some?

172
00:17:23.155 --> 00:17:27.737
Really, thank you. But um, I have
to get going. I'll see you later,


173
00:17:27.738 --> 00:17:30.488
and thanks again for the bed.

174
00:18:12.072 --> 00:18:14.862
- Hey.
- Hey.


175
00:18:14.863 --> 00:18:18.571
Twelve years of Catholic school,
church every Sunday.


176
00:18:18.572 --> 00:18:23.363
Altar boy - the whole shebang.
Couldn't get out of it if I tried.


177
00:18:26.363 --> 00:18:29.529
D'you mind if I ask
you a personal question?


178
00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.197
Depends on the question.

179
00:18:32.822 --> 00:18:35.405
Why are you always so jumpy?

180
00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:38.612
I don't know.
I'm not usually like this.


181
00:18:38.613 --> 00:18:43.947
It's just... Do you ever feel
like someone's watching you?


182
00:18:43.988 --> 00:18:45.821
What, do you mean
like a guardian angel?


183
00:18:45.822 --> 00:18:51.738
No, like...
like someone's stalking you.


184
00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:56.905
But...
Someone's stalking you?


185
00:18:56.947 --> 00:18:59.747
You've been here for what, like a week,
and you already have a stalker?


186
00:19:00.697 --> 00:19:02.237
I'm so jealous.

187
00:19:02.238 --> 00:19:07.113
I don't know.
It just feels like someone is.


188
00:19:07.197 --> 00:19:11.404
Maybe it's just being away from
home and all, that's got me nuts.


189
00:19:11.405 --> 00:19:14.237
It sounds like you've
got a lot on your mind.


190
00:19:14.238 --> 00:19:16.862
Yeah. I guess I do.

191
00:19:16.863 --> 00:19:19.404
- How's your vanilla?
- It's good.


192
00:19:19.405 --> 00:19:22.322
Yeah?

193
00:19:23.197 --> 00:19:25.947
Nah, chocolate's still better.

194
00:19:28.155 --> 00:19:30.737
Well, my stalking duties end here.

195
00:19:30.738 --> 00:19:33.821
Wait. I thought I was stalking you.

196
00:19:33.822 --> 00:19:37.947
Right. Sorry, I keep
getting that part mixed up.


197
00:19:38.572 --> 00:19:40.154
What are you doin' tomorrow night?

198
00:19:40.155 --> 00:19:43.155
Oh, I have to work.

199
00:19:44.155 --> 00:19:49.572
Maybe, um, maybe we could do
something on Saturday, though?


200
00:19:49.613 --> 00:19:52.113
I'd like that.

201
00:19:52.822 --> 00:19:55.612
Well, good night.

202
00:19:55.613 --> 00:19:58.113
Good night.

203
00:20:33.238 --> 00:20:36.862
- Angie, you are the... twenty-seventh?
- That's right.


204
00:20:36.863 --> 00:20:40.612
...female student that we've spoken to
since Rebecca Miller went missing,


205
00:20:40.613 --> 00:20:42.946
and you all have every
reason to be concerned.


206
00:20:42.947 --> 00:20:45.404
Now, we've put extra squad cars
on the streets,


207
00:20:45.405 --> 00:20:48.946
and I know that campus security
is very aware of the situation.


208
00:20:48.947 --> 00:20:50.654
Why would someone
put this on my door?


209
00:20:50.655 --> 00:20:53.487
People have been putting
these things up everywhere.


210
00:20:53.488 --> 00:20:57.113
My door was the only one
in the entire building.


211
00:20:58.363 --> 00:21:01.238
Let me give you my card.

212
00:21:01.405 --> 00:21:05.321
If this guy tries anything, you
call me up and we'll come straightaway.


213
00:21:05.322 --> 00:21:08.697
- Thank you.
- OK.


214
00:21:42.905 --> 00:21:47.155
No!

215
00:21:48.488 --> 00:21:51.780
Come on!

216
00:21:56.572 --> 00:21:59.697
- Car trouble?
- Yeah, kind of.


217
00:21:59.738 --> 00:22:01.737
Pop the hood. I'll
take a look at it.

218
00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:04.779
Geez, I am gonna be so late!

219
00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.321
I'll tell you what.

220
00:22:06.322 --> 00:22:09.571
I'll give you a ride, and then I'll
come back and take a look at your car.


221
00:22:09.572 --> 00:22:14.405
- Are you sure? It's kinda far.
- It'll be my pleasure.


222
00:22:21.655 --> 00:22:24.987
You weren't kidding when
you said this place was out here.


223
00:22:24.988 --> 00:22:27.737
I'm sorry.
I really appreciate you doing this.


224
00:22:27.738 --> 00:22:30.737
Don't be sorry. 
I'm happy to do it.

225
00:22:30.738 --> 00:22:32.571
Thanks.

226
00:22:32.572 --> 00:22:35.072
You're welcome.

227
00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:50.154
So, call me in a few, and I'll let you
know if you need to take it to a mechanic.


228
00:22:50.155 --> 00:22:52.822
You're sweet.

229
00:22:59.197 --> 00:23:03.822
Remind me to offer to
fix your car more often.


230
00:23:05.405 --> 00:23:08.530
- Hi, Mr Stanton.
- Hi, Angie.


231
00:23:10.197 --> 00:23:12.946
- Is that your boyfriend?
- No, just a friend.


232
00:23:12.947 --> 00:23:15.696
I had a little car trouble,
so he gave me a ride.


233
00:23:15.697 --> 00:23:16.987
Huh. Nice friend.

234
00:23:16.988 --> 00:23:18.904
Yeah. He is a nice friend.

235
00:23:18.905 --> 00:23:22.238
Hm.

236
00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:29.487
Is there any chance
you could give me a ride home?


237
00:23:29.488 --> 00:23:31.947
I don't see why not.

238
00:23:31.988 --> 00:23:34.529
Psst.

239
00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:38.238
- Ah, here. I'll take that.
- Thanks.


240
00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.237
You weren't kidding
about the cowboy outfit.


241
00:23:51.238 --> 00:23:53.571
Like I said,
he never takes the thing off.


242
00:23:53.572 --> 00:23:57.322
You wouldn't believe what a pain
it is to get him to take a bath.


243
00:23:57.988 --> 00:24:01.154
Sam couldn't stop talking about
you after you left the other day.


244
00:24:01.155 --> 00:24:03.737
Really?
I wasn't sure he even liked me.


245
00:24:03.738 --> 00:24:05.862
- Oh, no, no, no, no, he loves you.
- Oh.


246
00:24:05.863 --> 00:24:08.946
It's just, you know, he gets very
quiet when he first meets people.


247
00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:10.279
Oh.

248
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.654
OK, so let me just
show you a few things.


249
00:24:13.655 --> 00:24:15.779
Here is the TV remote.
Sam is a heavy sleeper,


250
00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.154
but you might want to
keep it low, just in case.


251
00:24:18.155 --> 00:24:21.987
And here is the phone with all the contact
numbers that you could possibly need.


252
00:24:21.988 --> 00:24:24.487
- Keys to the Jeep, in case you need it.
- Got it.


253
00:24:24.488 --> 00:24:27.112
Help yourself to anything
in the refrigerator,


254
00:24:27.113 --> 00:24:29.654
but the bottom row is Sam's.
He's on a special diet,


255
00:24:29.655 --> 00:24:32.404
so don't feed him anything
that's not in those containers,


256
00:24:32.405 --> 00:24:34.029
just in case he wakes up hungry.

257
00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:35.696
So, we all set?

258
00:24:35.697 --> 00:24:38.529
I think so. Are you sure
you don't have any questions?


259
00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:40.029
Oh, come on. She's fine.

260
00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.321
- We're running late anyway.
- OK, OK.


261
00:24:42.322 --> 00:24:45.362
- Do you have any idea when you'll be back?
- We shouldn't be gone


262
00:24:45.363 --> 00:24:48.279
more than three or four hours.
Just make yourself at home.


263
00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.154
- We'll see you later.
- Have a good night.


264
00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:53.363
- OK, thanks.
- Don't forget to call.


265
00:26:07.197 --> 00:26:12.947
Don't start playing games with
yourself. It's just an old house.


266
00:26:51.405 --> 00:26:55.863
There's a heart attack
waiting to happen.


267
00:27:15.905 --> 00:27:17.946
- Hello?
- Hi. It's me


268
00:27:17.947 --> 00:27:22.029
Hey there, me. How's the babysitting
going? The kid driving you crazy yet?


269
00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:25.196
- No, it's like he's not even here.
- I guess that's good right?


270
00:27:25.197 --> 00:27:28.446
I just wanted to let you know
you don't have to come get me.


271
00:27:28.447 --> 00:27:30.112
Mr Stanton's gonna give me a ride.

272
00:27:30.113 --> 00:27:33.988
Oh. I was actually
looking forward to it.


273
00:27:34.072 --> 00:27:39.655
In fact, you called right
at the moment of truth.


274
00:27:40.197 --> 00:27:42.362
Oh, I'm good.

275
00:27:42.363 --> 00:27:43.654
Your starter connection was bad.

276
00:27:43.655 --> 00:27:46.821
I took it apart, put it back
together and reconnected it.


277
00:27:46.822 --> 00:27:48.487
Thank you so much

278
00:27:48.488 --> 00:27:50.404
So, uh, I'll see you later?

279
00:27:50.405 --> 00:27:52.905
OK. I'll see you later.

280
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:09.321
Stanton residence.

281
00:28:09.322 --> 00:28:11.821
Hello?

282
00:28:11.822 --> 00:28:15.154
Rick, is that you?

283
00:28:15.155 --> 00:28:20.030
I'm sorry. Whoever this is, I can't
hear you. I'm gonna hang up now.


284
00:28:40.613 --> 00:28:43.780
Hello?

285
00:28:55.988 --> 00:28:58.237
That was fast.

286
00:28:58.238 --> 00:28:59.737
Did you just try calling me?

287
00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:01.362
No.

288
00:29:01.363 --> 00:29:03.779
- Oh. OK.
- Are you OK?


289
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:07.029
I'm fine. Someone just tried calling,
and I thought it might be you.


290
00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.612
No, wasn't me.

291
00:29:08.613 --> 00:29:10.904
OK, well, I will call you later.

292
00:29:10.905 --> 00:29:13.363
OK

293
00:29:29.947 --> 00:29:32.822
Maybe a little TV will help.

294
00:29:36.322 --> 00:29:40.612
Woo-woo-woo-woo ha-ha! Ladies
and gentlemen, thank you very much.


295
00:29:40.613 --> 00:29:42.571
Thank you.

296
00:29:42.572 --> 00:29:45.196
It would be a good idea not
to leave it on at full volume,


297
00:29:45.197 --> 00:29:47.987
if you don't want it played too loud.

298
00:29:47.988 --> 00:29:51.322
I hope that didn't wake him.

299
00:30:21.072 --> 00:30:23.780
He does sleep like a rock.

300
00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:20.029
Oh, God, you scared me.

301
00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.071
I'm sorry, did I wake you up?

302
00:31:22.072 --> 00:31:23.904
Hungry.

303
00:31:23.905 --> 00:31:28.780
Oh. OK, let's go get
you something to eat.


304
00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:44.738
Your mom said you can only
eat the food on the bottom...


305
00:31:45.738 --> 00:31:48.613
You want me to
heat some of this up?

306
00:31:57.613 --> 00:32:03.488
Diced red meat.
Very rare diced red meat.


307
00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:06.530
Let's get a different one.

308
00:32:11.738 --> 00:32:15.447
I guess it's diced rare meat.

309
00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.655
Are you sure you're
supposed to have this?


310
00:32:43.322 --> 00:32:45.697
OK.

311
00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:52.446
Do you want some ketchup
or something?


312
00:32:52.447 --> 00:32:55.530
Careful, you're gonna burn your...

313
00:33:30.155 --> 00:33:32.613
Hello?

314
00:33:34.447 --> 00:33:37.197
Please stop calling here.

315
00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:54.822
Did you hear that?

316
00:35:14.447 --> 00:35:17.530
Good evening, Montague Dispatch.

317
00:35:17.988 --> 00:35:20.154
One moment, please.

318
00:35:20.155 --> 00:35:23.822
Chief... Line one.

319
00:35:24.113 --> 00:35:25.362
Dinneli here.

320
00:35:25.363 --> 00:35:27.654
Hi, this is Angie.
I came by your office today


321
00:35:27.655 --> 00:35:29.779
Oh, yeah.
Hi, Angie, how you doin'?


322
00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:33.487
I'm not sure. I'm babysitting
at seven-twenty-four Lancaster Road


323
00:35:33.488 --> 00:35:35.654
That's the Stanton place.
I know it.


324
00:35:35.655 --> 00:35:37.279
I think there's someone
outside the house.


325
00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.612
Did you see someone?

326
00:35:38.613 --> 00:35:41.237
Not exactly. I just keep
hearing strange noises,


327
00:35:41.238 --> 00:35:44.112
and I keep getting these
phone calls where no one talks.


328
00:35:44.113 --> 00:35:47.612
- How would you describe the noises?
- I don't know. Like locks rattling,


329
00:35:47.613 --> 00:35:50.612
- like there's someone outside the door.
- Angie, I need you to calm down.


330
00:35:50.613 --> 00:35:53.071
Now, did you see someone outside?

331
00:35:53.072 --> 00:35:55.154
No, it just feels like there is.

332
00:35:55.155 --> 00:36:00.154
OK, well, I'm just about to make my rounds,
so I will swing by and check it out, OK?


333
00:36:00.155 --> 00:36:02.613
Thank you.

334
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:12.780
Sam?

335
00:36:15.572 --> 00:36:18.280
Sam?

336
00:36:21.322 --> 00:36:24.822
Sam?

337
00:36:45.905 --> 00:36:47.779
Sam, are you getting back in bed?

338
00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:53.363
I think you should
brush your teeth... first.


339
00:37:07.613 --> 00:37:10.238
Sam?

340
00:37:14.072 --> 00:37:16.655
Where are you?

341
00:37:31.488 --> 00:37:34.238
Are you playing a game with me?

342
00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:48.947
Come on, Sam! I need you to get back
in bed before your parents get home.


343
00:37:49.905 --> 00:37:54.405
Hey, buddy, where are you goin'?

344
00:38:05.697 --> 00:38:08.238
Sam?

345
00:38:57.738 --> 00:39:00.405
Sam!

346
00:39:01.697 --> 00:39:06.697
Sam, I'm done playing now, OK?
You have to get in bed.


347
00:39:09.947 --> 00:39:14.238
I'm serious. This isn't funny.
You need to go to sleep.


348
00:39:26.822 --> 00:39:29.280
Sam?

349
00:39:41.363 --> 00:39:44.155
Sam, are you in here?

350
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:51.988
It's past your bedtime.

351
00:39:52.697 --> 00:39:56.905
Your mommy is gonna be
very, very upset with you.


352
00:40:02.488 --> 00:40:05.238
Do you hear me, young man?

353
00:40:22.988 --> 00:40:25.447
Hello?

354
00:40:25.572 --> 00:40:28.030
Who is this?

355
00:40:35.738 --> 00:40:38.362
Hey, you ruined my surprise.
I'm about 20 minutes away.


356
00:40:38.363 --> 00:40:40.779
Oh, thank God!
I'm freaking out right now.


357
00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.279
- Hey, why, what's wrong?
- This guy keep calling...


358
00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.612
the kid is playing hide-and-seek
and the house is making strange noises.


359
00:40:46.613 --> 00:40:49.405
Whoa. Angie, slow down.

360
00:40:49.863 --> 00:40:52.530
What's your problem, buddy?

361
00:40:52.572 --> 00:40:56.363
Hey, Angie, I gotta pull over
for a second. Hold on.


362
00:40:59.155 --> 00:41:01.862
Rick? Hello?

363
00:41:01.863 --> 00:41:05.447
Oh great.

364
00:43:35.738 --> 00:43:38.238
Find a weapon.

365
00:45:39.655 --> 00:45:42.488
Ahh!

366
00:45:44.613 --> 00:45:46.862
Sam?

367
00:45:46.863 --> 00:45:49.572
Sam, wait!

368
00:45:54.238 --> 00:45:59.030
Help, somebody!
Let go of me!


369
00:46:29.947 --> 00:46:35.030
Sam? Sam, where are you?!

370
00:46:35.697 --> 00:46:39.988
Sam, come on, we have to go!

371
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:42.947
Sam!

372
00:46:50.155 --> 00:46:54.363
Sam, please, I know you're scared.

373
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:02.738
Look, I'm scared too Sam,
but we have to go.


374
00:47:05.363 --> 00:47:08.030
Sam, please!

375
00:47:12.155 --> 00:47:15.238
Why?

376
00:47:18.447 --> 00:47:19.737
Oh.

377
00:47:19.738 --> 00:47:22.488
Oh, Sam, thank God!

378
00:47:22.905 --> 00:47:26.822
I need you to come with me, OK?
Come on.


379
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:33.488
Come on.

380
00:47:34.447 --> 00:47:37.071
- We're just gonna go for a
little drive, OK? - Hungry.


381
00:47:37.072 --> 00:47:41.405
I know. We'll get you something
to eat later, OK, sweetie?


382
00:47:42.697 --> 00:47:46.405
Oh no, I left
the keys in the house.

383
00:47:46.447 --> 00:47:49.571
OK, we're just gonna run inside,
we're gonna grab the keys,


384
00:47:49.572 --> 00:47:52.530
and we're gonna get out of here, OK?

385
00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:19.071
Sam, I need you to wait here
until I get back, OK? OK?


386
00:48:19.072 --> 00:48:21.697
Wait here.

387
00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:00.529
- Evil! Evil!
- Sam, run!


388
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:03.862
Evil! Ah! Evil!

389
00:49:03.863 --> 00:49:07.280
Run!

390
00:49:11.988 --> 00:49:14.572
Stay away from him!

391
00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:22.197
Evil! Evil! Evil!

392
00:49:25.488 --> 00:49:28.737
Evil!

393
00:49:28.738 --> 00:49:31.572
Let go!

394
00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:55.030
Sam, are you all right?

395
00:50:17.572 --> 00:50:20.238
Hungry.

396
00:50:23.697 --> 00:50:26.238
God help me.

397
00:50:36.197 --> 00:50:37.571
Oh, my God, Sam, no.

398
00:50:37.572 --> 00:50:39.779
Oh, God, baby, are you OK?

399
00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:42.738
Another goddamn priest.

400
00:50:44.613 --> 00:50:47.029
Son of a bitch,
this is Father Nicoletta!


401
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:50.112
- Thought I killed that fucker in Romania.
- Well, I guess you didn't.


402
00:50:50.113 --> 00:50:51.696
You are one tough old bastard.

403
00:50:51.697 --> 00:50:55.321
Last time I saw you, you had an axe
stickin' out of the top of your head.


404
00:50:55.322 --> 00:50:58.780
- Jim, how did he find us?
- I don't know. Goddamn!


405
00:50:59.947 --> 00:51:03.321
Oh, oh, that's just great.
He's still alive. Just great!


406
00:51:03.322 --> 00:51:07.780
Come on, baby, let's get out of here.

407
00:51:10.863 --> 00:51:14.363
Well, he's dead now.
They're like fuckin' rats.


408
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:18.697
Ohh!

409
00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:21.362
Hold on there, Missy.

410
00:51:21.363 --> 00:51:24.363
You're not going anywhere.

411
00:51:25.988 --> 00:51:28.447
Sorry.

412
00:51:35.322 --> 00:51:38.572
Vi... Stop.

413
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:42.322
We covered our tracks so well.

414
00:51:46.197 --> 00:51:47.696
How did he find us, Jim?

415
00:51:47.697 --> 00:51:52.279
I don't know. I don't know. But where
there's one, there's gonna be more.


416
00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:56.488
I thought we finally
had a home for once.


417
00:52:06.197 --> 00:52:10.654
There's only one thing we can do.
We have to leave tonight.


418
00:52:10.655 --> 00:52:12.946
And go where?

419
00:52:12.947 --> 00:52:16.696
We have people in Colorado. We can stay
with them till we get our place set up.


420
00:52:16.697 --> 00:52:21.029
Hon... Listen, it's gonna be OK.

421
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:25.279
OK.

422
00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:28.737
I'll pack our things and you go
prepare Sam's food for the trip.


423
00:52:28.738 --> 00:52:33.237
OK. Wait, there's only one thing -
the girl we bagged tonight,


424
00:52:33.238 --> 00:52:35.071
she's still got the
drugs in her system.


425
00:52:35.072 --> 00:52:40.030
Do your best to bleed her out.
We need both of them.


426
00:52:40.738 --> 00:52:45.488
We can't leave a trail of dead
bodies all the way to Colorado.


427
00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:50.238
OK.

428
00:52:55.905 --> 00:52:58.363
Come here, honey.

429
00:53:54.905 --> 00:53:57.196
Ah!

430
00:53:57.197 --> 00:53:59.697
Yeah.

431
00:54:11.947 --> 00:54:15.030
One hell of a night, huh?

432
00:54:16.197 --> 00:54:17.862
Let me guess.

433
00:54:17.863 --> 00:54:21.280
You're probably wondering
right about now...


434
00:54:21.905 --> 00:54:25.237
what the hell's goin' on.

435
00:54:25.238 --> 00:54:28.363
Bottom line, Angie...

436
00:54:29.363 --> 00:54:32.238
we gotta feed Sam.

437
00:54:32.988 --> 00:54:35.447
Only problem is...

438
00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:42.155
he only likes female flesh.

439
00:54:45.322 --> 00:54:47.571
And it can't be any female flesh...

440
00:54:47.572 --> 00:54:51.362
it has to be good, clean
wholesome female flesh...


441
00:54:51.363 --> 00:54:57.113
which, as you can imagine,
is not that easy to come by.


442
00:55:03.238 --> 00:55:05.738
Ah.

443
00:55:07.238 --> 00:55:10.404
And you can't just go around
grabbing up a whole flock of girls,


444
00:55:10.405 --> 00:55:15.655
cos then the local people start gettin'
suspicious. Then you gotta move again.


445
00:55:24.405 --> 00:55:32.280
Last time we went out...
we took Sam with us... big mistake.


446
00:55:35.155 --> 00:55:38.613
Had to grab a local
girl named Rebecca.


447
00:55:39.072 --> 00:55:43.113
You know, I really hate to do that.

448
00:55:54.738 --> 00:55:58.196
That is why we had
to get you to baby-sit.


449
00:55:58.197 --> 00:56:03.363
Then eventually, of course,
you'd have to find out about Sam.


450
00:56:04.947 --> 00:56:09.613
But then again, you're a nice
clean girl, aren't you, Angie?


451
00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:17.654
You know... It is so nice to
have somebody out here to talk to.


452
00:56:17.655 --> 00:56:22.322
I'm always out here alone
doing this. Always.


453
00:56:23.572 --> 00:56:28.363
My father... used to
have a meat packing plant.


454
00:56:28.613 --> 00:56:34.487
Every summer I worked there
till I turned eighteen.


455
00:56:34.488 --> 00:56:37.738
Yeah.

456
00:56:38.905 --> 00:56:43.404
You know, I haven't really gotten used
to slaughtering human beings, though.


457
00:56:43.405 --> 00:56:46.988
Hence the cut marks.

458
00:57:37.646 --> 00:57:40.188
Oh, come on.

459
00:57:42.854 --> 00:57:44.687
Oh, hey. No, no, no.

460
00:57:44.688 --> 00:57:47.687
You don't have to worry.
No, listen.


461
00:57:47.688 --> 00:57:50.853
I'm gonna hit you right here
in the forehead, right here.


462
00:57:50.854 --> 00:57:53.728
It's only gonna hurt
for a split second.


463
00:57:53.729 --> 00:57:56.062
See, it kills the brain,
leaves the heart pumpin'.


464
00:57:56.063 --> 00:57:59.188
That way, I can drain
all the blood outta you.


465
00:58:20.521 --> 00:58:22.312
Aw, no, no, no, no.

466
00:58:22.313 --> 00:58:25.187
No dying on me yet.
Go ahead, breathe.


467
00:58:25.188 --> 00:58:28.645
You son of a bitch!
I hope you rot in hell!


468
00:58:28.646 --> 00:58:31.062
What the hell was that?
You know what?


469
00:58:31.063 --> 00:58:34.978
I said it was nice to have you out here.
Guess what? It's not that nice.


470
00:58:34.979 --> 00:58:36.187
Jesus Christ!

471
00:58:36.188 --> 00:58:40.313
Try to be a nice guy,
and that's the thanks I get.


472
00:58:41.521 --> 00:58:46.271
Are you happy? She's probably
already started to coagulate!


473
00:59:54.604 --> 00:59:59.979
You know, this part used to
bother me too, when I first started.


474
01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:02.687
What are doing talking to her?

475
01:00:02.688 --> 01:00:04.770
- I thought you liked her.
- Are you serious?


476
01:00:04.771 --> 01:00:08.187
Well, it's not like I'm out here
having sex with her or somethin'.


477
01:00:08.188 --> 01:00:11.312
I didn't say that you were. It's
just you have to kill her in a minute.


478
01:00:11.313 --> 01:00:13.478
Why talk to her...
what is the point?


479
01:00:13.479 --> 01:00:16.520
Hey, I have asked you many times
to come out here and help me.


480
01:00:16.521 --> 01:00:21.228
- Each time your response has been "No."
- You know that is not my thing.


481
01:00:21.229 --> 01:00:24.562
Oh, and... and cutting girls into
bite-sized pieces is my thing?


482
01:00:24.563 --> 01:00:27.478
Look, I just came out here to
tell you that I'm done packing...


483
01:00:27.479 --> 01:00:29.853
and whenever you're
finished here, we can leave.


484
01:00:29.854 --> 01:00:33.271
Hey. Come here, Vi.

485
01:00:33.438 --> 01:00:36.104
What?

486
01:00:36.146 --> 01:00:40.895
I'm sorry, OK? This night has
just got me all worked up.


487
01:00:40.896 --> 01:00:44.604
- Kiss?
- Hm.


488
01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:53.729
OK, back to work.

489
01:03:03.438 --> 01:03:05.979
One down, one to go.

490
01:03:06.729 --> 01:03:10.396
You know, we really did like
you as a babysitter, Angie.


491
01:03:13.563 --> 01:03:17.187
Hell, you saved Sam from that priest
while we were out gettin' him more food.


492
01:03:17.188 --> 01:03:19.353
Not a lot of people
would've done that.


493
01:03:19.354 --> 01:03:24.229
Course, you didn't know Sam was the son
of the devil at the time, I'm assuming.


494
01:03:25.688 --> 01:03:28.146
You didn't know, right?

495
01:03:29.354 --> 01:03:31.979
I didn't think so.

496
01:04:02.063 --> 01:04:07.021
Well, Angie...
It's about that time.


497
01:04:08.063 --> 01:04:11.604
Once again,
I'm really sorry about this.


498
01:04:13.646 --> 01:04:15.603
Don't move.

499
01:04:15.604 --> 01:04:19.270
Cos if I don't hit you right
in the centre of the forehead,


500
01:04:19.271 --> 01:04:20.562
I'm gonna injure you,

501
01:04:20.563 --> 01:04:24.438
and I really don't want
you to be in any pain.


502
01:04:42.104 --> 01:04:46.396
What the hell?
Did you call the cops?


503
01:04:49.896 --> 01:04:54.228
Don't make a sound, you understand me?
Cos I don't want to kill him,


504
01:04:54.229 --> 01:04:58.104
and I really don't want
to do you without the hammer.


505
01:05:11.271 --> 01:05:12.770
Good evening, Officer.

506
01:05:12.771 --> 01:05:15.020
- How you doin'?
- OK.


507
01:05:15.021 --> 01:05:16.562
How can we help you?

508
01:05:16.563 --> 01:05:18.145
Sorry to bother you guys so late,

509
01:05:18.146 --> 01:05:24.146
but, um, I got a call from uh, the girl
who was babysitting for you, named Angie.


510
01:05:29.479 --> 01:05:31.728
- She left about a half an hour ago.
- Mm-hm.


511
01:05:31.729 --> 01:05:33.270
She in some sort of trouble?

512
01:05:33.271 --> 01:05:37.562
Well, she had called earlier and said
there was someone outside the house.


513
01:05:37.563 --> 01:05:40.770
Really? That's funny. She didn't
mention anything to us about it.


514
01:05:40.771 --> 01:05:44.063
- She mention it to you, honey?
- No, not at all.


515
01:06:03.938 --> 01:06:06.771
Guess it was a false alarm.

516
01:06:06.896 --> 01:06:08.187
You folks have a good night.

517
01:06:08.188 --> 01:06:11.229
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Thank you.


518
01:07:07.313 --> 01:07:08.812
He knows.

519
01:07:08.813 --> 01:07:11.979
All right, calm down.
He doesn't know anything.


520
01:07:17.563 --> 01:07:20.229
Dispatch, can you
run a plate for me?


521
01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:32.021
What is he doing?

522
01:07:32.063 --> 01:07:37.021
Probably trying to find out
what doughnut shop to go to.


523
01:07:39.521 --> 01:07:41.062
See?

524
01:07:41.063 --> 01:07:42.395
OK, OK.

525
01:07:42.396 --> 01:07:45.228
I'm gonna finish the second girl.
Now, have Sam ready to go, OK?


526
01:07:45.229 --> 01:07:48.188
- All right. OK.
- All right?


527
01:08:13.479 --> 01:08:15.645
You bitch! You cut me!

528
01:08:15.646 --> 01:08:18.938
How does it feel, asshole!

529
01:08:19.563 --> 01:08:22.146
Ow!

530
01:08:42.063 --> 01:08:46.021
Come on, Angie...
there's nowhere to run!


531
01:09:58.063 --> 01:10:00.938
It's all over now, Angie.

532
01:10:02.604 --> 01:10:05.104
Angie!

533
01:10:05.146 --> 01:10:08.688
You're really making this
harder than it needs to be.


534
01:10:46.604 --> 01:10:49.313
Come on, Angie!

535
01:10:49.438 --> 01:10:52.646
I didn't ask for this life, Angie.

536
01:10:54.854 --> 01:10:57.854
It was set upon me.

537
01:10:58.896 --> 01:11:03.979
You've seen the boy.
You know the truth.


538
01:11:08.021 --> 01:11:12.438
How can you be in his presence
and not believe?


539
01:11:16.188 --> 01:11:19.521
Did you find your boyfriend, Angie?

540
01:11:21.438 --> 01:11:24.938
It's too bad he had
to die for no reason.


541
01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:28.688
Sam just won't eat male flesh.

542
01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:33.688
I'm gonna bleed you slow... real slow!

543
01:12:49.979 --> 01:12:52.438
Damn, that hurts!

544
01:12:58.646 --> 01:13:01.062
Oh... Fuck.

545
01:13:01.063 --> 01:13:04.438
I think you cut through a tendon.

546
01:13:08.896 --> 01:13:11.813
Wake up!

547
01:13:11.938 --> 01:13:14.062
I want you to feel this!

548
01:13:14.063 --> 01:13:17.229
Good, you're awake.

549
01:13:21.946 --> 01:13:25.363
Drop it, asshole!

550
01:13:28.279 --> 01:13:30.445
You got any more weapons on you,
son of a bitch?


551
01:13:30.446 --> 01:13:32.612
Get on your knees, now!

552
01:13:32.613 --> 01:13:34.320
Get on your knees.

553
01:13:34.321 --> 01:13:37.321
How you doin', Chief?
All the way down.


554
01:13:41.196 --> 01:13:45.196
Don't worry, Angie.
I'll get you outta here.


555
01:13:47.154 --> 01:13:49.362
Behind you!

556
01:13:49.363 --> 01:13:51.946
Aargh!

557
01:14:30.946 --> 01:14:33.404
Violet?

558
01:15:07.446 --> 01:15:09.862
Stop, stop, it's over.

559
01:15:09.863 --> 01:15:11.445
- No, no!
- It's over, it's over.


560
01:15:11.446 --> 01:15:16.154
It's OK, it's OK.
They're dead. They're dead.


561
01:15:18.446 --> 01:15:20.904
Come on.

562
01:15:30.988 --> 01:15:33.070
My car's parked up on the main road.

563
01:15:33.071 --> 01:15:36.613
There's, there's keys in the truck.

564
01:15:37.029 --> 01:15:40.154
- Are you sure?
- Yes.


565
01:16:08.863 --> 01:16:10.362
Hold on, I'll be right back.

566
01:16:10.363 --> 01:16:12.403
Where are you going?

567
01:16:12.404 --> 01:16:14.612
- The kid's inside. I gotta go get him.
- No!


568
01:16:14.613 --> 01:16:18.403
Aargh! Don't worry, I'll be back.
It'll just take a second.


569
01:16:18.404 --> 01:16:21.363
No, he's the devil!

570
01:16:21.446 --> 01:16:23.445
Angie, it's gonna be OK.

571
01:16:23.446 --> 01:16:24.945
No, it's not!

572
01:16:24.946 --> 01:16:29.071
No. We have to go! 
We have to go!

573
01:16:33.654 --> 01:16:36.196
No. please!

574
01:16:45.654 --> 01:16:48.863
Oh, please!

575
01:16:49.321 --> 01:16:51.779
Let me out of here!

576
01:16:51.904 --> 01:16:54.070
Hungry.

577
01:16:54.071 --> 01:16:56.779
Please, let me out of here!

578
01:16:57.321 --> 01:17:00.737
Hungry.

579
01:17:00.738 --> 01:17:05.946
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me, please!


580
01:17:07.738 --> 01:17:11.238
Hungry.

581
01:17:24.029 --> 01:17:26.946
Go away!

582
01:17:51.821 --> 01:17:54.363
Sam?

583
01:18:00.571 --> 01:18:02.112
Sam, look.

584
01:18:02.113 --> 01:18:04.820
There plenty of food
in here for you.


585
01:18:04.821 --> 01:18:06.487
See?

586
01:18:06.488 --> 01:18:09.654
Sam, you don't have to eat me.

587
01:18:11.821 --> 01:18:14.488
Sam?

588
01:18:19.613 --> 01:18:22.278
- No, Sam, please.
- Hungry.


589
01:18:22.279 --> 01:18:24.403
Please, Sam. Stop.

590
01:18:24.404 --> 01:18:27.154
Hungry!

591
01:19:06.029 --> 01:19:07.903
Still hungry?

592
01:19:07.904 --> 01:19:10.488
Well, choke on this.

593
01:20:56.779 --> 01:20:58.862
How's she doin'?

594
01:20:58.863 --> 01:21:01.654
She's lost a lot of blood.

595
01:21:01.738 --> 01:21:03.528
- And she's in a coma.
- Uh-huh.


596
01:21:03.529 --> 01:21:08.153
You know, I, uh, I don't know
when she'll come out of it.


597
01:21:08.154 --> 01:21:09.653
OK.

598
01:21:09.654 --> 01:21:12.654
But when she does, you let me know.

599
01:21:14.196 --> 01:21:18.195
Goddamn slaughterhouse out there.
We need some answers.


600
01:21:18.196 --> 01:21:21.946
Doctor, look, she's awake.

601
01:21:25.654 --> 01:21:29.738
Angie... Can you blink for me?

602
01:21:30.321 --> 01:21:31.612
Good.

603
01:21:31.613 --> 01:21:34.946
Can you see better now?

604
01:21:35.529 --> 01:21:36.653
Angie?

605
01:21:36.654 --> 01:21:39.403
No! No! No!

606
01:21:39.404 --> 01:21:43.945
Angie, it's OK. It's OK.
You're safe. Nurse! Nurse!


607
01:21:43.946 --> 01:21:46.487
You're safe. You're safe.

608
01:21:46.488 --> 01:21:47.653
Rick?

609
01:21:47.654 --> 01:21:48.903
Yeah.

610
01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:52.528
Oh, God, Rick.
Oh, please don't leave me.


611
01:21:52.529 --> 01:21:55.904
No, I'm not going anywhere.

612
01:21:56.696 --> 01:22:00.403
Angie, I'm gonna have to
ask you a couple questions.


613
01:22:00.404 --> 01:22:02.195
Can't you give her a little time?

614
01:22:02.196 --> 01:22:04.070
No, son, I'm sorry, I can't.

615
01:22:04.071 --> 01:22:07.570
Now, Angie, your friend here said
you were babysitting. Is that correct?


616
01:22:07.571 --> 01:22:09.820
Yes.

617
01:22:09.821 --> 01:22:12.195
Can you remember what
happened to the child?


618
01:22:12.196 --> 01:22:13.862
What do you mean?

619
01:22:13.863 --> 01:22:15.445
We couldn't find him.

620
01:22:15.446 --> 01:22:16.570
What?

621
01:22:16.571 --> 01:22:18.987
We found Chief Dinneli,

622
01:22:18.988 --> 01:22:20.487
the parents,

623
01:22:20.488 --> 01:22:23.445
and 20 female bodies
buried in the backyard.


624
01:22:23.446 --> 01:22:25.195
None of them were children.

625
01:22:25.196 --> 01:22:29.613
But he was in the barn.
He was in the barn!


626
01:22:29.821 --> 01:22:31.820
Angie, try and remember exactly...

627
01:22:31.821 --> 01:22:33.903
- Let her be.
- ... where you last saw him.


628
01:22:33.904 --> 01:22:36.403
- Miss, can I help you?
- I'm her mother.


629
01:22:36.404 --> 01:22:40.988
- Mom!
- It's OK, baby. I'm here now.


630
01:22:43.446 --> 01:22:45.778
I'll be outside if you
need anything, OK, Angie?


631
01:22:45.779 --> 01:22:49.071
No, Rick, stay. Please, stay.

632
01:22:51.488 --> 01:22:54.488
We need to pray.
