00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.482
Hey, Seth Rogen. What up, man?

2
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.288
Oh, hey, John! Over here!

3
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.250
Welcome to Los Angeles International Airport.

4
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.129
Attention, all passengers.

5
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.123
Do not leave your baggage unattended.

6
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.771
All unattended baggage is subject to search...

7
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.969
I'm so happy!

8
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.246
Look at this!

9
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.606
What's happening, man?

10
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.966
Good to see you, buddy.

11
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.485
- How you doing?  
- I'm good, man.

12
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.601
Yes, you are.

13
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.361
How long has it been, man?

14
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.606
Sometime in the last...

15
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.648
- Inside of a year or something.  
- Yeah.

16
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.360
I have the best weekend ever planned, man.

17
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.842
- Lay it on me.  
- Ooh! I don't want to ruin it.

18
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.645
- Seth Rogen!  
- Shit, here we go. Hey.

19
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.085
- How's it going, man?  
- Yeah, good.

20
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.931
So, you, like, always play, like,
the same guy in every movie.

21
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.729
When are you gonna do
some, like, real acting, man?

22
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.801
Okay, thank you.

23
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.882
Give me something. 
Give me, like, the laugh, man.

24
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.291
Give me the Seth Rogen laugh.

25
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.761
Seth Rogen, everybody.

26
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.128
All right, I've landed. I'm here. 
We've said our hellos.

27
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.204
Can we please go to fucking Carl's Jr.?

28
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.963
I would... I would
love to. I'm on a...

29
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.601
I can't really eat that stuff right now.

30
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.920
- I'm on a, uh...  
- What?

31
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.001
I'm on this cleanse.

32
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.809
You're... You're on a what?

33
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.120
I'm on a cleanse.

34
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.168
- What?  
- It's good for you.

35
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.890
I didn't know... 
You're supposed to take six shits a day.

36
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.405
- That's not true.  
- It is true!

37
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.001
- You're supposed to shit twice a day.  
- No.

38
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.690
That's not true. 
That's what they used to think.

39
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.047
Now they know you're supposed
to shit six times a day.

40
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.691
So you're not drinking. 
You're not smoking weed. You're not...

41
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.565
- No, no, I'm drinking and smoking weed.  
- But...

42
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.324
I'm on a cleanse. 
I'm not psychotic.

43
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.164
Look, man, if you stopped eating gluten,

44
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.322
you'd feel way fucking better all day.

45
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.360
Whenever you feel shitty, that's 'cause of gluten.

46
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.526
- That's not true.  
- It is.

47
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.642
- Who the fuck told you not to eat gluten?  
- It's just true.

48
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.324
You don't even know what gluten is.

49
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.640
I know what fucking gluten is.

50
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.966
No, you have no idea what gluten is.

51
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.041
I do know what gluten is.

52
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.645
Gluten's a vague term.

53
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.803
It's something that's used to categorize
things that are bad, you know?

54
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.531
Calories, that's a gluten. 
Fat, that's a gluten.

55
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.649
Somebody just told you
you probably shouldn't eat gluten,

56
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.404
you're like, "Oh, 
I guess I shouldn't eat gluten."

57
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.642
Gluten means bad shit, man,
and I'm not eating it.

58
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.681
God!

59
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.440
Each bite is better than the previous bite.

60
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.124
- It is.  
- Gluten!

61
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.841
Hey, this looks beautiful.

62
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.365
Yeah. Do you like it? 
I totally redid it.

63
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.441
It's fucking awesome.

64
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.726
It's all new. Those are new.

65
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.444
- God damn, son!  
- It's pretty nice, huh?

66
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.721
So this is how the other half lives.

67
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.524
- Come on.  
- Amazing.

68
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.523
- Air hockey tables.  
- Jesus Murphy!

69
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.170
Right? Okay, get ready, Jay.

70
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.207
What?

71
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.327
I have a little surprise for you.

72
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.367
Okay.

73
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.727
Here's the best weekend you
ever had in your life.

74
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.366
Look at it, man.

75
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.044
Oh, my... Are you serious?

76
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.246
It's all of your favorite things.

77
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.727
Starburst and Airheads on a...

78
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.767
And it says "Jay."

79
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.569
- In joints.  
- In joints.

80
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.529
It says "Jay" in jays.

81
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.841
Seth Rogen, you are just the best people.

82
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.321
Come on, I know you don't love it
in LA, so I figure I'll make it...

83
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.801
You know, I'll lube up
your entry a little bit.

84
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.882
- It eases the transition.  
- Yeah, right?

85
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.570
This is the much-needed foreplay.

86
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.641
You know what else I got?

87
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.926
Yo, this...

88
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.445
- A 3
-D television.  
- No, you didn't...

89
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.409
- I got a 3
-D TV.  
- Are you serious?

90
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.887
- Oh, my God.  
- I did it, man.

91
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.200
What?

92
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.770
Let's get into it.

93
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.524
Oh, my God, bud.

94
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.085
It's Gandalf the Grey's pipe.

95
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.400
Damn, no shit.

96
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.648
Hello, little hobbit.

97
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.087
- Spark my ganja.  
- Yeah.

98
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.847
I'm a well-known homosexual advocate.

99
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.082
# Backstreet's back, all right #

100
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.610
# Everybody Rook your body #

101
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.166
# Everybody Everybody #

102
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.686
# Rock your body
right Rock your body #

103
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.603
# Everybody! #

104
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.125
# Backstreet's back... #

105
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.441
Oh, my eyes feel like they're melting.

106
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.131
I need a break.

107
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.206
Oh. You know what, actually?

108
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.123
We should go to Franco's house soon.

109
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.480
He's having a housewarming party.

110
00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.971
He just finished building his house.

111
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.080
I haven't even seen it yet,

112
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.963
but it's supposed to be bonkers.

113
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.246
I haven't been in
LA in, like, a year,

114
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.608
and I came here to chill with you.

115
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.808
We can chill together, and
we'll chill with those other guys.

116
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.803
We'll all chill as one big unit.

117
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.291
Will I even know anybody there?

118
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.407
You know James Franco.

119
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.801
James Franco doesn't even know my name.

120
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.086
Jonah Hill will be there.

121
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.650
Can't stand him. 
He can't stand me.

122
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.451
He's, like, the nicest guy in the world! 
He likes you so much.

123
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.329
He specifically talks about how he likes you.

124
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.561
Out of nowhere, he
just said, "You know what?"

125
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.687
"Jay's an inspiration."

126
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.411
There's no way he said that. 
Also, just can't stand him.

127
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.084
Okay, fine. Craig Robinson.

128
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.161
Never met him.

129
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.651
He's hilarious.

130
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.808
Sweats a lot, but he's a great guy.

131
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.405
So it's gonna be fun, man.

132
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.890
For you, I will go.

133
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.531
I promise, I'll stay
with you all night, okay?

134
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.843
I won't ditch you. 
No, 'cause I want to be with you all night.

135
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.082
And you know why else?

136
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.527
'Cause nobody puts Jay in the corner.

137
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.046
Awesome.

138
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.804
- Thank you. Thank you.  
- There you go. Cool.

139
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.410
Thanks a lot, eh? Thanks a lot.

140
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.527
Okay, man.

141
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.650
Holy shit.

142
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.325
This is crazy!

143
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.687
- Yeah?  
- Yeah, man, right?

144
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.888
- Look at it.  
- A bit much.

145
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.405
I don't think it is a bit much.

146
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.720
I think it's right on the money.

147
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.325
What is he, Pablo Escobar?

148
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.686
Come on, man, this is an awesome street.

149
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.444
Channing Tatum lives up there.

150
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.284
- Oh, for the love of...  
- Will you stop talking about...

151
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.481
This is the sexiest street in America.

152
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.686
You and Channing Tatum.

153
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.046
I think he's attractive.

154
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.323
- I think it's a cool house.  
- I know you do.

155
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.925
I can't wait to see inside it.

156
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.604
That's why I'm excited.

157
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.401
Ha-ha! Yes! What's up, man? Seth!

158
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.403
- So happy you're here.  
- I'm so happy to be here.

159
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.720
Hey, Johnny, what's up?

160
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.245
- It's Jay.  
- It's Jay.

161
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.687
I'll never forget it again, man. 
Good to see you.

162
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.489
Nice to see you. Come
on in. Yeah! Yeah, great.

163
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.801
Check it out. My new place!

164
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.609
Awesome, man!

165
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.846
Designed it myself.

166
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.685
Really cool. This place is beautiful, man.

167
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.762
This place is like a piece of me.

168
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.922
You two just stepped inside me.

169
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.086
You let us both come inside you. Yeah.

170
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.891
Icing on the cake. Check it out.

171
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.687
Painted them myself.

172
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.081
Huh.

173
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.083
Side by side. A team.

174
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.207
Holy shit.

175
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.409
So, is it weird?

176
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.448
- No.  
- You sure?

177
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.204
I really like it.

178
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.406
What do you think, Jay?

179
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.608
I'm not a big art guy.

180
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.966
You don't like art?

181
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.929
Well, come on...

182
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.923
- You play video games?  
- Yes.

183
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.048
Well, guess what, buddy? You like art.

184
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.121
Yep.

185
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.326
You ever been to Subway?

186
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.447
Yes.

187
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.931
You order a sandwich?

188
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.128
Somebody put that together
for you, dude. That's art.

189
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.281
Sandwich artist.

190
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.600
So, let me lay this on you, Jay.

191
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.681
Oh, fuck.

192
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.966
Your mama's pussy was the canvas.

193
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.804
Your dad's dick was the paintbrush.

194
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.882
Boom. You're the art. Huh?

195
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.404
- Thanks, James Franco.  
- You got it.

196
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.970
- Seth!  
- Mindy, hello.

197
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.644
- Oh, my God, great to see you.  
- Oh, you, too.

198
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.960
Long time. How's it going?

199
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.327
- You know Jay?  
- I don't think I've ever actually met you.

200
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.050
You were so good in Million Dollar Baby.

201
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.162
That's amazing. 
Thank you so much for saying that.

202
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.163
Oh, my God, if I
don't fuck Michael Cera tonight,

203
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.248
- I'm gonna blow my brains out.  
- What?

204
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.527
Fucking pale, 110 pounds,

205
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.082
hairless, probably has a huge
cock, coked out of his mind...

206
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.401
You can do a lot better. 
That's just trouble.

207
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.041
So, Ri
-Ri, how about you, you ever see a psychiatrist?

208
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.326
Um...

209
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.480
- That's not cool.  
- Don't touch my butt, bitch.

210
00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.608
- Michael, that's not cool.  
- Would you shut the fuck up, Jason!

211
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.569
We're playing a game, man.

212
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.809
Say cheese, baby.

213
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.605
- What's up, buddy?  
- How's it going, dude?

214
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.886
Good to see you, man.

215
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.530
- Is that Jay Baruchel?  
- Hi, there. Hey.

216
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.681
Oh, my God, get in here, dude.

217
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.400
- How's it going, Jonah?  
- What are you doing?

218
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.681
- Good. How you doing, buddy?  
- Oh, my gosh.

219
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.808
- Welcome back.  
- Thank you very much.

220
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.769
- When'd you get in?  
- Uh, this morning,

221
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.683
and boy, are my arms tired.

222
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.486
Dude, that's great.

223
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.561
- Thank you.  
- Sick.

224
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.165
What have you guys been doing?

225
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.083
Oh, we just hung out all day.

226
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.085
Ate a bunch of dirty burgers, and
smoked about a fucking pound of weed

227
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.571
and played a bunch of video games.

228
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.881
Weed is tight. Weed is tight. 
That's awesome.

229
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.200
That's awesome. 
Weed is awesome.

230
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.607
It was like the
golfing sequence in Navy SEALs.

231
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.728
- Sick reference, though, bro.  
- Oh, thanks, bud.

232
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.962
Dude, your references are out of control. 
Everyone knows that.

233
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.644
- Hey, thanks, man.  
- I'm jealous.

234
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.007
I would have been there in a heartbeat,

235
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.402
but, uh, I actually
just adopted this incontinent spaniel.

236
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.561
She's a really beautiful soul.

237
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.290
- Her name's Ahjhai.  
- Ahjhai?

238
00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.407
- Yeah.  
- How do you spell it?

239
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.287
You want to see a picture of her?

240
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.408
- Oh, she's so sweet.  
- Hey!

241
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.720
- Look at her. 
- Aw!

242
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.484
She can't bark. 
She doesn't know how, so...

243
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.641
She doesn't know how to bark, even?

244
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.721
She doesn't know how to bark,

245
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.404
so I've tried to teach her

246
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.642
and she just kind of
screams, and so she was up,

247
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.405
had her face smushed against
the cage, and was, like...

248
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.720
Ah!

249
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.011
Yeah, cool. Um...

250
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.967
Tell you what, boys, 
I'm kind of jonesing,

251
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.408
so I'm gonna find someone I can
bum a smoke off of outside, all right?

252
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.249
That's tight, dude. Honestly, I like you.

253
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.321
Hey, likewise.

254
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.851
Okay, dude, come back.

255
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.764
I'll be right back. 
You're holding court. 
All right, boys.

256
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.044
Dude. I know. I
think we're making some progress.

257
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.087
That was really good.

258
00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.521
And honestly, he's your old friend.

259
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.925
We're your new friends. 
He feels threatened.

260
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.001
Yeah, man.

261
00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.770
You know, and I get it.

262
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.807
It's gonna be fine.

263
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.280
I honestly think tonight's the night

264
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.520
we bust this whole thing open.

265
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.723
And I'm lucky. 
It's the same thing a lot, though.

266
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.450
It's, like, my TV wife opens the fridge,

267
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.364
and is, like, "What
happened to the birthday cake?"

268
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.125
And I come out with,
like, a little frosting, like,

269
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.561
"What birthday cake?"

270
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.204
'Cause you ate the cake! Yeah.

271
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.486
'Cause you ate the cake!

272
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.800
"It's my birthday."

273
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.211
That's why y'all number one. '
Cause of that.

274
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.607
- You're Jay, right?  
- Yeah.

275
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.681
- Seth's boy?  
- Yeah.

276
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.046
How you doing, man? 
Good to see you.

277
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.201
Good. Likewise, likewise.

278
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.242
- I'm Craig, man. 
This is Emma.  
- Hi. Hi, there.

279
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.971
You just in town visiting him, or what?

280
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.203
Yeah. Just for a little visit, you know.

281
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.282
I try to not
come down here very much.

282
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.646
I don't really love it here.

283
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.687
You don't like LA?

284
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.560
I'm just not really into the LA lifestyle.

285
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.366
What lifestyle are you into?

286
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.966
Look at him. He's, like, a hipster, right?

287
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.611
No, I'm not a hipster, at all.

288
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.286
Yeah, yeah, you do seem
to hate a lot of things,

289
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.044
and the bottom of
your pants are awful tight.

290
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.966
No, I just... I don't like Los Angeles. 
It doesn't make me a hipster.

291
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.281
I'll bet you hate
movies that are universally loved.

292
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.361
I don't even...

293
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.521
You like Forrest Gump?

294
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.171
No, no, it's a horrendous piece of shit.

295
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.322
"Life is like a box of chocolates," no?

296
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.930
Yeah, no, I'm familiar with it.

297
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.207
"You never know what you're gonna get."

298
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.125
Why don't we do
a sequel to Pineapple Express?

299
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.605
I would love to
do a sequel to Pineapple.

300
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.681
Do you have any ideas, or...

301
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.364
- I do have an idea.  
- What?

302
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.649
It's that Red, 
Danny, has become, like, the drug lord,

303
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.688
you know, since we killed the other one,

304
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.842
and he wants to assassinate Woody Harrelson,

305
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.930
'cause he's gonna give a speech
that makes all of weed legal,

306
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.367
effectively rendering drug lords out of business.

307
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.289
- Awesome.  
- Yeah, it's fucking awesome,

308
00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.966
but we don't have... 
We don't know how it should end yet.

309
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.326
I... I know.

310
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.046
- Danny's trying to kill us.  
- Yeah.

311
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.726
And I sacrifice myself for you.

312
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.246
And he kills me,

313
00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.651
and I die for you.

314
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.369
And Danny fucking eats me.

315
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.323
- Why does he eat you?  
- I don't know.

316
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.926
I'm just trying to think of,
like, the nastiest way to go.

317
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.401
Yeah, he could eat you. Okay. 
That's a good idea, man.

318
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.767
He's just out of his mind. 
He just, like, eats me.

319
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.446
Hey, Chris. How's it going?

320
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.488
- Hey, does this coke smell funny?  
- Ooh!

321
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.483
Fuck! Michael, what the fuck, man?

322
00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.130
That's expensive shit, motherfucker!

323
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.281
What are you doing?

324
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.760
I've never fucking done cocaine, dude. 
Why does it fucking...

325
00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.729
Well, you did the best
shit possible for your first time,

326
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.841
'cause that's good fucking...

327
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.126
Fuck, fuck, fuck, 
I'm nervous, dude.

328
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.525
- I don't know what...  
- What is wrong with you, man?

329
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.681
- Look, he's freaking out.  
- Oh, shit.

330
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.205
I've never done this fucking drug before, man.

331
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.281
Mike, please.

332
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.010
I'll walk you through it. 
I will walk you through it.

333
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.809
- Mike, no one...  
- I'll be your guide.

334
00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.524
You're fine, Chris. You're fine. Is it on...

335
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.681
You got some in your mustache, baby.

336
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.807
- What are you...  
- Michael!

337
00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.083
Now, fellas, I want you
to real sexy right now.

338
00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.242
We're gonna sing to all the ladies.

339
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.762
All the fellas go like
this, in your Barry White voice.

340
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.524
# Take your panties off #

341
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.204
# Take your panties off #

342
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.850
# Take your panties off #

343
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.765
# Take your panties off #

344
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.128
# Come on, Rihanna Take
your panties off for me #

345
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.170
# Come on, Craig, can
you fuck off for me? #

346
00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.849
I'll do one of them things.

347
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.680
Like an angel.

348
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.450
What about the host of the party?

349
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.204
# I ain't got no panties on #

350
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.968
# He ain't got no panties, everybody! #

351
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.769
# We ain't got no panties on #

352
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.564
# We ain't got no panties on #

353
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.290
# We ain't got no panties on #

354
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.601
# We ain't got no panties on #

355
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.684
# Ain't nobody got no panties on #

356
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.205
# We ain't got no panties on #

357
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.685
# Ain't no party
like a no-panty party #

358
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.160
# 'Cause a no-panty party don't stop #

359
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.364
# Fuck those panties #

360
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.930
# Fuck those... #

361
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.923
# Fuck those panties #

362
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.525
# Fuck those panties #

363
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.125
# Fuck those panties #

364
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.440
What's not kid-friendly?

365
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.005
There's a lot of sharp edges. 
Concrete, sharp edges.

366
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.809
He's gonna bust his head
open on one of those things.

367
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.000
A kid could fall off
this fucking railing right here.

368
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.769
That's why you have the
railing, so they don't fall.

369
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.843
- Hey. Sorry.  
- I want to have kids one day.

370
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.526
- Hey, Jay.  
- Oh, hey, hi, Jonah.

371
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.602
Is there any place around here
I can buy a pack of cigarettes?

372
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.767
Yeah.

373
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.081
There's a place like, it's
like, four blocks away, maybe.

374
00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.485
You want to come with me?

375
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.568
Give me this much time. 
That much joint time.

376
00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.046
Oh!

377
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.929
- Jesus!  
- Hey, Jay.

378
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.448
Hey, you need to use
the toilet, honey? Go ahead.

379
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.923
Nope, I'm... I sorry.

380
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.521
Who wants a sip? Sip time.

381
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.761
You okay, man?

382
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.524
It's nothing. It's just, you know,

383
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.729
as soon as we got there, you
did what you said you wouldn't do.

384
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.127
- What did I do?  
- You just fucking ditched my ass.

385
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.010
I didn't ditch you. 
Are you kidding me, man?

386
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.286
I did not ditch you.

387
00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.728
I was talking to Jonah, and then
you left to go have a cigarette.

388
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.883
Well, you know, my cigarette was an excuse.

389
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.042
I really went outside 'cause
Jonah was being a prick.

390
00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.804
Jonah was not being a prick.

391
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.405
If anything, you were
kind of being a prick.

392
00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.050
Jonah's the nicest guy ever, man.

393
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.851
Oh, my God, that's
a thin veneer of kindness.

394
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.921
Nobody's that nice.

395
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.081
Jonah is that nice.

396
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.725
Serial killers are that nice.

397
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.723
Just answer me one question.

398
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.087
Is Michael Cera's butthole
as adorable as I pictured?

399
00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.400
Oh, for fuck's sake.

400
00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.528
I picture it looking like a little donut,

401
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.204
like a little pink sprinkled donut.

402
00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.244
Oh, it's so bright in here.

403
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.924
It is fucking bright.

404
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.764
Oh, I'm so high.

405
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.287
There's so many delicious
choices. What do I do?

406
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.249
- I'm gonna get something to drink.  
- Okay.

407
00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.084
Excuse me, would it be possible

408
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.605
for my daughter to use your restroom?

409
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.125
She's really got to go.

410
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.601
Read the sign. 
Customers only.

411
00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.681
Seriously?

412
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.411
Why the fuck you think
I put up the sign?

413
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.244
It's okay, Dad. 
I can hold it.

414
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.840
Let's just buy something for your mother.

415
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.491
Yeah, well, I guess you better, huh?

416
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.324
This cash register lady is mean.

417
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.129
I have anxiety. 
Will you buy this for me?

418
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.645
When I'm stoned, 
I can't do this.

419
00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.927
I think I'm just gonna
head back to your place.

420
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.884
I'm not really liking it
very much over there at Franco's.

421
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.401
Dude, I want you to get to know these guys. 
That's never gonna happen

422
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.404
if you don't put
in any effort whatsoever, okay?

423
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.050
I hate it in there.

424
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.726
I just want to drink
some pop and smoke some weed.

425
00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.880
What about...

426
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.324
What about me?

427
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.090
Are you okay? Are you okay?

428
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.571
Did you just see that?

429
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.971
What the hell?

430
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.130
Oh, my God, Jesus, Jesus! 
Run, run, run!

431
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.164
- This way!  
- Okay, okay, okay!

432
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.009
Oh, my God! Oh, oh...

433
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.360
Oh, Jesus.

434
00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.046
Run!

435
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.451
Jesus Christ!

436
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.724
Why the fuck did
you bring me down here?

437
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.042
The fuck, Seth? 
I don't know what's happening!

438
00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.209
- We're going back to Franco's.  
- Why?

439
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.207
Just run! Keep running!

440
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.520
Oh, my fuck!

441
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.362
We are going back to Franco's!

442
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.521
Oh, God damn it.

443
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.645
Jesus! Oh, shit!

444
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.683
This way. We're almost there! 
We're so close!

445
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.961
Hey, you guys okay?

446
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.166
Are you guys okay?

447
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.084
There was a crazy earthquake. 
Did you guys feel that?

448
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.571
- That was insane.  
- Fuck, no.

449
00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.641
We can't feel anything in here.

450
00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.404
This place is a fucking fortress.

451
00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.244
That wasn't an earthquake, man.

452
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.964
That was something way fucking crazier. No...

453
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.041
What's crazier than an earthquake?

454
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.567
There were beams of blue
light coming out of the sky

455
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.166
and people getting sucked up into the sky.

456
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.447
He's on hallucinogens.

457
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.241
Come on, guys. 
Don't bully Jay. 
He's a sweetheart.

458
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.040
Keep going, man. 
What are you talking about?

459
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.241
There were people, and they were there,

460
00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.926
and they got sucked up into the sky.

461
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.809
Jay. Sucked up into the sky?

462
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.450
Nobody got sucked up in here.

463
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.522
I got sucked off here.

464
00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.965
No, okay, ask Seth. He was...

465
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.166
You were there. Tell them.

466
00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.641
Seth, what the fuck's he talking about?

467
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.324
I have no idea
what he's talking about honestly.

468
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.165
Did anybody get sucked up into the sky?

469
00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.321
I didn't see anything.

470
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.805
I don't know what he's talking about.

471
00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.450
You were there with me. 
What are you saying?

472
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.520
All those people that were in the
store with us, they just fucking vanished.

473
00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.324
I didn't see blue light
sucking people up in the sky.

474
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.801
You sound crazy, man. 
We should just be lucky we're...

475
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.927
It's not over!

476
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.161
It's okay. Just relax.

477
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.810
Everyone, it's all right. 
Just a little tremor. 
Party's still going.

478
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.962
In
-N
-Out truck's coming in 10 minutes.

479
00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.009
- Yes.  
- Animal style!

480
00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.770
Oh, my fuck!

481
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.689
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!  
- Move! Move!

482
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.967
- Move, move, move, move!  
- This place is safe!

483
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.804
This place is not safe!

484
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.166
Craig, where you going, man?

485
00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.049
- It's a fucking earthquake!  
- Fuck!

486
00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.969
Move, move, move, come on! 
Get out of my way. Move, girl!

487
00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.242
- Oh, my God, Seth!  
- Oh, shit!

488
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.731
Seth. What the fuck?

489
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.162
Don't go on the grass,
not everybody on the grass!

490
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.205
What the fuck?

491
00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.770
Oh, God!

492
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.404
What the fuck is happening? Paul!

493
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.891
What's happening?

494
00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.691
All right, everybody, listen up. Listen up.

495
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.445
Who took my fucking cell phone, man?

496
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.091
- Martin, empty your pockets!  
- What?

497
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.601
I saw you in the bathroom, man! 
Somebody dial my phone!

498
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.523
Shut the fuck up! 
It's unbelievable!

499
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.888
It's unacceptable after all the
coke I've wasted on you people.

500
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.047
I've thrown it away.

501
00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.406
I didn't take your fucking cell phone.

502
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.603
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Mike,
Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike...

503
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.606
My face!

504
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.921
What's happening to me? 
What's happening?

505
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.365
Oh, my God!

506
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.089
Oh, shit, that's embarrassing.

507
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.481
Rihanna!

508
00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.287
Please give me your foot!

509
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.771
Oh, my God!

510
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.364
Craig, Craig, help me. 
I'm losing my grip!

511
00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.805
It's too late for you! 
You're already in the hole!

512
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.927
What the fuck are you talking about?

513
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.081
Get the fuck out of my way!

514
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.006
Oh!

515
00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.081
Sorry.

516
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.771
Karen!

517
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.525
Seth, come on! 
Get in the house! Come on, Seth!

518
00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.842
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die!

519
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.325
Martin!

520
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.607
Oh, shit! Kevin! Kevin!

521
00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.727
What the fuck?

522
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.490
Geez, get the fuck off me, Aziz!

523
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.848
Ow, ow, ow!

524
00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.171
Fuck you, Kevin!

525
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.447
Oh, God, no, get
your fucking hands off me!

526
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.806
Get your fucking...

527
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.482
No!

528
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.642
Jay, I can't hold on much longer.

529
00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.644
You have to reach out
and grab me. You hear?

530
00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.441
Okay, uh, you take my hand,
and I will swing you up.

531
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.170
Are you sure? I'm gonna
give you my whole weight.

532
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.645
- I'm gonna reach for you, all right?  
- Yeah, yeah.

533
00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.484
Are you sure you can do that?

534
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.800
I can grab you on three.

535
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.490
One, two, three.

536
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.761
All right, buddy.

537
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.842
Now I'm gonna, 
I'm gonna swing across.

538
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.967
I got you, buddy.

539
00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.560
You're gonna hold my weight, all of it.

540
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.601
Okay, come on.

541
00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.682
- You can hold on to my full weight?  
- I can do it.

542
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.760
- I don't want to die.  
- Okay.

543
00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.484
One, two... Two, three.

544
00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.200
No!

545
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.243
No! No!

546
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.324
Oh, man.

547
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.286
Fuck.

548
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.766
Holy shit! What happened?

549
00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.410
Jay, you're alive. Jay.

550
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.845
- Oh, thank God, Jay.  
- I'm not dead yet.

551
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.445
I told you guys not to go outside.

552
00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.567
What just happened?

553
00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.005
Jesus Christ, they are all fucking dead.

554
00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.650
I told you guys not to run outside.

555
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.721
You all right?

556
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.723
I tried to save Aziz. I tried.

557
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.609
You did your best, man. I love you.

558
00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.967
Why the fuck did
you guys run out there?

559
00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.605
You know what, 
James, can you lower your voice?

560
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.886
You're freaking out Jay!

561
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.809
Maybe I'm a little freaked out, too!

562
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.445
- He's not as strong as you.  
- They all fell in.

563
00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.688
- Look at my house!  
- I tried to save them. 
They all fell in.

564
00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.411
Get your fucking hands off me. 
Jonah, stop touching me.

565
00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.050
Can we get Jay some water, please?

566
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.326
Can we get him some hydration?

567
00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.850
- He needs to be hydrated.  
- The water's not working!

568
00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.410
Everyone just runs out the door!

569
00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.766
My phone is dead.

570
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.524
Guys, the fucking internet's not working!

571
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.489
Let's watch the TV. 
Let's check the news.

572
00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.324
Where is the TV?

573
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.442
- It's in the floor.  
- In the floor?

574
00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.249
- Oh, that's dope.  
- Yeah, cool, huh?

575
00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.361
That's really neat.

576
00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.851
That is impressive, James.

577
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.042
The biggest earthquake to ever hit Les...

578
00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.930
Officers urging people to stay
in their homes right now.

579
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.002
And also reports of looting and rioting

580
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.121
are spreading across the city.

581
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.361
Riots.

582
00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.805
Police are pretty much outnumbered

583
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.962
as people are turning to one another.

584
00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.769
Martial law has now been declared.

585
00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.330
Air Force One has gone down...

586
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.370
Shit. It's gone, guys.

587
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.602
So I think we should...

588
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.803
I think we should probably
go back to your place, eh?

589
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.291
What are you talking about, man?

590
00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.569
No, no way. I'm not leaving here.

591
00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.008
I don't want to
die at James Franco's house.

592
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.965
You heard the TV.

593
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.726
The TV said stay here. 
It said stay in your homes.

594
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.883
We need to stay here
until they start rescuing people, okay?

595
00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.486
A huge earthquake happens. 
Who do they rescue first?

596
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.971
- Actors.  
- Famous people.

597
00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.520
They'll get Clooney, 
Sandra Bullock, me.

598
00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.364
If there's room, you guys'll come.

599
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.800
The point is, is that we're
all gonna get out of this first.

600
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.721
What the hell was that?

601
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.165
It's already going crazy out there, guys.

602
00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.483
We can't leave. 
I'm not leaving, okay? I'm a victim.

603
00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.404
I've had a victim's mentality my whole life. 
People can smell it on me.

604
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.323
When I was a kid, 
I had man-titties.

605
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.084
The bullies held me down, they tittie-fucked me.

606
00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.491
That's what's happening out there right now.

607
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.840
That's right, we are all soft.

608
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.046
Yeah. We are all soft!

609
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.088
We are actors! 
We pretend to be hard, man.

610
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.003
Yeah. We soft as baby shit.

611
00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.686
As baby shit, soft as... Wait, 
Craig, what are you doing, man?

612
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.240
Hey, hey, what are you doing? 
What are you doing to the painting, man?

613
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.964
- We got to board this shit up, man.  
- Board it up?

614
00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.485
We got to protect ourselves. 
We don't know...

615
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.284
- how long we gonna be in here.  
- Okay, chill.

616
00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.566
There's raccoons, and bandits, and shit out there.

617
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.130
- This is Obey, man!  
- If you get out the way!

618
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.521
This is my favorite fucking painting! 
What are you doing, Craig?

619
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.601
Guys, help.

620
00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.523
Help. Help. Get off.

621
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.206
Chill. Look.

622
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.089
Helicopter! Helicopter!

623
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.206
The good guys are here. We're fine! 
It's gonna be fine.

624
00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.930
God damn!

625
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.923
Oh! God damn!

626
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.765
Ow! Shit!

627
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.841
You Okay?

628
00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.251
No, I'm not okay!

629
00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.448
Fuck your house, Franco!

630
00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.801
- My house didn't do that!  
- Aah!

631
00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.080
Ow.

632
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.290
You don't got a tool kit or nothing? 
Just a toolbox?

633
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.725
I don't know. Look in there.

634
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.289
Where's the edge of this shit?

635
00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.488
Your thumb's in my butthole, man.

636
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.006
Whoa.

637
00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.730
Y'all need this dick?

638
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.841
No, we're not using it.

639
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.440
All right, I'm gonna take it over here.

640
00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.847
Careful with that dick. Damn.

641
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.525
It's heavy.

642
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.323
There it is, got that dick now.

643
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.846
That dick is coming now.

644
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.681
Yeah, got this big dick.

645
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.325
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey.

646
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.970
- What now?  
- Listen.

647
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.089
Not the Rogen, all right? 
Don't take him.

648
00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.247
Take me.

649
00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.767
We got 12 bottles of
water, 56 beers, two vodkas,

650
00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.969
four whiskeys, six bottles of wine, tequila, Nutella,

651
00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.726
cheese, pizza, eggs, bananas, apples, bacon, steaks,

652
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.725
pancake mix, CT Crunch,
milk, ketchup, a Milky Way,

653
00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.889
half ounce Sour Diesel, three and
a half grams Grand Master Kush,

654
00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.122
one ounce of shrooms, 15 pills of ecstasy,

655
00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.202
a porno mag, a baseball bat,

656
00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.647
and the video camera
from the movie 27 Hours.

657
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.210
127 Hours.

658
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.965
Uh...

659
00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.849
127 Hours.

660
00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.129
And a functioning revolver from the movie Flyboys.

661
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.611
Old faithful.

662
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.011
- Jesus.  
- Thing's real.

663
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.889
- No, I kept this from the movie.  
- Yeah.

664
00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.530
- This is an actual revolver.  
- I see.

665
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.647
Franco, that's very uncomfortable.

666
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.767
Could you put that down, please?

667
00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:30.807
Loaded.

668
00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.291
- Love it.  
- Awesome.

669
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.084
- Can you just put the gun away?  
- I always keep my props.

670
00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.208
- That's really cool.  
- Always keep my props.

671
00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.361
I know how to handle it.

672
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.965
He knows what he's doing. 
I like this bit.

673
00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.451
I like it. I
get it. Let me see.

674
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.488
- It's real. It's heavy.  
- Let me see it like that.

675
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.164
- God damn!  
- Come on, guys!

676
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.321
- You could kill...  
- Careful.

677
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.481
- Bang, bang!  
- Jesus!

678
00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.891
Please, put it down! Oh, fuck!

679
00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.008
Bang, bang, bang. You're dead.

680
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.168
- I hope you're fucking happy.  
- Pow, pow, pow.

681
00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.924
Stop... Guys, stop fucking with the gun.

682
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.525
Jesus! Jesus! Pow, pow.

683
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.601
- It's a real gun!  
- Bang.

684
00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.681
It's so funny. 
It's so funny.

685
00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.240
- Guys, it's funny.  
- It's not funny!

686
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.691
We're getting sidetracked.

687
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.046
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

688
00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.531
- I'll just kill myself.  
- No!

689
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.761
- Don't do that, Jonah!  
- Jesus.

690
00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:05.841
Oh, no. Jonah, give it back.

691
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.560
- I don't know! 
I don't know.  
- Don't do that.

692
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.364
Jonah. I'm so...

693
00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.204
- Oh, my God. Hey.  
- Oh, dude.

694
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.770
Come on, no, no. Don't. Jesus!

695
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.370
Would you put the thing down? The whole...

696
00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.726
I'm trying to have some fun, man.

697
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.484
Okay, okay, Jesus.

698
00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.722
Look, just because a bunch of
people fell into a hole outside

699
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.200
doesn't mean we can't have some fun.

700
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.891
We're a bunch of best friends hanging out. 
It's like a sleepover.

701
00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.327
Okay, food. How are
we gonna deal with this?

702
00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.207
Um...

703
00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.486
Can I have that Milky Way?

704
00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.005
No, you can't have the Milky Way.

705
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.246
That's my Milky Way. 
There's a bunch... What?

706
00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.731
I went out this morning,

707
00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.883
specifically bought this Milky Way
to eat after my party.

708
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.961
That's weird.

709
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.485
It's not weird. 
It's my special food.

710
00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.210
I like it. Back
me up on that, Seth.

711
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.566
I don't think you should
get the whole Milky Way.

712
00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.687
I want some of the Milky Way.

713
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.491
I'd be pretty bummed if I don't at
least get a bite of the Milky Way.

714
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.607
Oh! Now Craig wants a
bite of the Milky Way.

715
00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.160
Yeah, I want a bite of the Milky Way. 
It's a fucking Milky Way.

716
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.885
A fifth of everything
is what's fair and reasonable.

717
00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.769
Everyone gets a fifth of everything.

718
00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.410
I want one-fifth of your T-shirt!

719
00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.244
I want the bottom part, the belly.

720
00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.765
I'm not sporting a
crop top in your house.

721
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.410
I'll cut that shit
off and make a headband.

722
00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.209
You couldn't handle my midriff.

723
00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.124
Guys, the only issue is, 
I kind of need the Milky Way.

724
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.361
For fuck's sake.

725
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.771
No, for real, I have low blood sugar,

726
00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.841
and if my endorphins drop too low,

727
00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.921
I'm gonna be a nightmare to be around.

728
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.923
- What?  
- Your LBS starts acting up,

729
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.968
you can have a
finger scoop of Nutella, okay?

730
00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.441
- One finger scoop of Nutella.  
- Fair.

731
00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.164
I'm going to bed.

732
00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.685
Jesus fucking...

733
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.330
Don't touch that Milky Way, Jonah.

734
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.726
Night, James.

735
00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.091
Oh, God, no!

736
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.251
Fuck.

737
00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.486
- Hey.  
- Hey.

738
00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.405
I'm gonna sleep with you.

739
00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.805
What? I'm gonna sleep with you.

740
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.927
It's too scary to sleep alone.

741
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.040
But this is my little area.

742
00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.730
Well, I'm invading your little area.

743
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.724
I'm sorry, but I'm too scared, okay?

744
00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.801
Are you mad at me, man?

745
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.644
If I was pissed at you,

746
00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.961
I'm sure it would have something to do

747
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.650
with the fact that I had no interest

748
00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.724
in coming to this house socially,

749
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.644
and now, I am barricaded in here

750
00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.690
with a bunch of
people that I really hate.

751
00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.844
Maybe this was meant to be.

752
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.163
Maybe this horrible, horrible, deadly earthquake happened

753
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.527
so we could become closer
as a group of friends.

754
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.201
I don't need a group. 
I'm like DMX, man. 
I'm a lone wolf.

755
00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.770
DMX isn't a lone wolf.

756
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.929
DMX has the Ruff Ryder crew.

757
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.287
You can't stop, drop,
and open up shop alone.

758
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.530
You need people to help
you in an earthquake disastery situation.

759
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.525
It was something else. 
It was Judgment Day.

760
00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.965
Like Terminator 2?

761
00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.327
No, not like Terminator 2. 
For God's sakes.

762
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.209
Like Skynet? You think this is Skynet?

763
00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.520
- No.  
- Like, Skynet went live?

764
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.364
Will you please stop saying "Skynet"?

765
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.568
Well, you're the one that said Judgment Day.

766
00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.244
The biblical Judgment Day.

767
00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.369
- What?  
- That's crazy. It's just...

768
00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.646
You fucking heathen.

769
00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.761
Okay, here's the thing.

770
00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.081
Let's say for a
second there was blue light

771
00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.730
sucking people up into the sky.

772
00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.282
That means that we were not
awesome enough to go to heaven.

773
00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.722
Shit! Shit.

774
00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.244
What y'all doing?

775
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.086
Fuck you, Craig.

776
00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.003
I'm scared. It's scary by myself.

777
00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.730
It's way better with more people.

778
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.167
I'm gonna come down here.

779
00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.686
Oh, yeah, good, yeah. 
Get in here, man.

780
00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:41.727
Get right in there.

781
00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.404
So, you're gonna...

782
00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.891
- Right here.  
- Right here.

783
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.606
I feel better, actually. I like that.

784
00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.004
It's better with more people.

785
00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.081
Hey, guys...

786
00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.242
- Jesus Christ.  
- Jesus!

787
00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.800
Sorry. Franco has this crazy open floor plan.

788
00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.803
I can hear every
word you guys are saying.

789
00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.201
I might as well hang
with you guys if that's cool.

790
00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.930
Nice. Coming in hot.

791
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.604
I gonna grab a blanket from you.

792
00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.011
Give me that blanket.

793
00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.844
- Get in the middle of it.  
- That's good.

794
00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.161
- That's it.  
- It feels so much more safe now, guys.

795
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.401
It's nice here.

796
00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.845
Should we spoon it? 
Yeah, you want to?

797
00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.046
- No!  
- Want to go...

798
00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.121
- Dick to butt?  
- No.

799
00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.321
My butt to you and then Jay.

800
00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.203
I don't want to
butt to dick to anything.

801
00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.520
Are you docking into me? 
You're doing tip to me?

802
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.601
Or what are you doing?

803
00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.761
Should we go butt
to butt or dick to...

804
00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:22.841
Seth and I are
gonna go ass to ass.

805
00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.126
Do you want to go front to front?

806
00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.282
No, I'm fine just going dicks up.

807
00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.441
Dicks up?

808
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.010
- I think I'm going dick to ass.  
- You know what?

809
00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.128
I'm going Scarface-style.

810
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.440
- Both of you guys.  
- Wait, yeah.

811
00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.681
- There we go.  
- Yeah.

812
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.807
This is the best way.

813
00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.961
Good night, boys.

814
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.407
- Good night.  
- Good night.

815
00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.720
Good night, guys.

816
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.529
- Night, my sweet guys.  
- Good night.

817
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.761
Sweet dreams, fellas.

818
00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.281
# Livin' on fat pockets
on flat wit tha gat #

819
00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.806
# Rollin' around a nine deuce Cadillac #

820
00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:16.207
# Still got my homies
to watch my back #

821
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.647
# And they'll smoke ya ass
if you wanna come and chat #

822
00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.570
# Why wallow when you come to roll on? 
I put the clip #

823
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.728
# And before I
bring ya ass on #

824
00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.962
# Kickin' dust on your
head like I bust #

825
00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.963
# My grip surrounded, 
I'm about... #

826
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.371
Fuck, yeah.

827
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.250
# When tha shit goes
down ya better be ready #

828
00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.651
# When tha shit goes down #

829
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.247
# When tha shit goes

830
00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.407
# When tha shit goes down #

831
00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:41.768
# When tha shit goes
down ya better be ready #

832
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.649
# Ya better be ready #

833
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.801
Franco! Good morning, sunshine.

834
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.120
Guys! Guys! Wake up!

835
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.010
Danny's alive! 
He's eating all the fucking food!

836
00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.048
No! Danny, man, don't.

837
00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:12.966
Danny!

838
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.087
No, it's cool, man. 
I fucking made this for you guys.

839
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.161
Stop eating!

840
00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.366
Don't eat another piece of bacon.

841
00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.566
Guys, just chill the fuck out, okay?

842
00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:22.610
I'm sure the Green Goblin
can fucking afford some more bacon.

843
00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.967
Dude, that shit's supposed to
last us till we get rescued!

844
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.489
Wait a second. 
I know what happened.

845
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.166
You guys dropped acid, didn't you? Mmm-hmm.

846
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.480
Craig doesn't have any pants on. 
He got fucking wild.

847
00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.966
Probably danced, sweated all over the place.

848
00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.326
You got white shit
all over your mouth, Franco.

849
00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.686
You probably sucked somebody's dick.

850
00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.570
Jonah over here probably watched and jerked off.

851
00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.802
Jay, I didn't even know you were in town. 
Good to see you.

852
00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.247
Danny, we're not on acid. 
We didn't suck each other's dicks!

853
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.051
James Franco didn't suck any dick last night?

854
00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.690
Now I know y'all are tripping.

855
00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.603
You actually not know what happened last night?

856
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.251
Daniel, you may want to
stay seated for a second.

857
00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.209
Some really messed-up stuff happened,

858
00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.521
and there were a lot of fatalities.

859
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.285
Oh, really? You're putting
your serious voice on, Jonah?

860
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.761
Okay, tell me about these "fatalities".

861
00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.923
Dude, Segel's dead, 
Krumholtz is dead, 
Michael Cera's dead.

862
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.686
Guess if Michael Cera's gone,
it's not a total loss, huh?

863
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.285
- Jesus, Danny.  
- Michael Cera's dead.

864
00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.089
- What?  
- It's not like that.

865
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.844
It's not funny, man. 
It's really not funny.

866
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.961
Seth, that's a better performance

867
00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.610
than you've given in your last six movies.

868
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.440
Where the fuck was
that in Green Hornet, huh?

869
00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.323
Jonah, you're fucking sucking balls.

870
00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.004
You're an Academy Award nominated person.

871
00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.447
You need to be
fucking selling that shit, dude.

872
00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.721
"Fatalities. There were some fatalities."

873
00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.327
Fatalities.

874
00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.884
Okay, now that was good. 
That was good.

875
00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.962
Does it seem like we're fucking joking?

876
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.611
Hey, hey, hey! 
What the fuck you eating, man?

877
00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.530
Spit it out your mouth. 
Give me the bacon!

878
00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.200
Shit.

879
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.371
Shit, what do we do?

880
00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.283
Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em!

881
00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.287
Should I shoot?

882
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.448
- Shut up, Franco!  
- Shoot the door, Franco!

883
00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.167
Oh, God!

884
00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.846
Did you not hear me knocking out here? 
I've been knocking forever.

885
00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.809
Please! Please! 
You've got to let me in!

886
00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.002
- Hang on a second.  
- What?

887
00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.560
Guys, I know it sounds really weird,

888
00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.086
but I don't think
we should let him in.

889
00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.327
Why not?

890
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.129
Yeah, why not? 
I can hear you, by the way.

891
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.850
I'm sorry. We just don't know you, man.

892
00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:24.367
You could be like, a looter,
or a rapist, or a tittie-fucker.

893
00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.771
Like, I'm sorry.

894
00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.684
Look, guys, we just boarded up
this whole house to keep everyone out,

895
00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.331
and the first guy comes to
the door, we're gonna let him in?

896
00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.925
I mean, how do we
know we can trust this guy?

897
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.765
I want to live! 
Things have gone crazy out here!

898
00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.083
"Fucking crazy out here!" This guy fucking sucks.

899
00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.207
What if he's the rapist?

900
00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.406
Man, even if he is a rapist,

901
00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.289
- he can't rape all of us.  
- Yeah! No! So I'm not...

902
00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.964
- I'm not a rapist!  
- You want to tittie-fuck us?

903
00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.805
If you want me to tittie-fuck you, I will! So good! 
You'll love it.

904
00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.166
Seth, back me up, please.

905
00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.561
We can't just leave him out there to die. 
Are you crazy?

906
00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.648
What do you want to do? 
I'll do whatever you want to do.

907
00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.801
Let's vote on it.

908
00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.689
Yeah, I fucking vote you let me in.

909
00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.205
Here's my vote. 
Fuck all of you.

910
00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.770
I'm letting him in. 
This is boring.

911
00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.721
There's something out here!

912
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.882
This is real! This is fucking real!

913
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.721
God damn it!

914
00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.005
You guys!

915
00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.520
This man was alive a few seconds ago.

916
00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.085
We can't play soccer with his head!

917
00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.525
Pick it up, Jonah!

918
00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.571
What the fuck is going on?

919
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.250
He blinked at me.

920
00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.448
He blinked at my face. 
Seth, put it over there.

921
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.046
Oh, my God!

922
00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.360
I got it. I got it, guys.

923
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.847
There's blood all over my floor!

924
00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.251
Time to relax for a second.

925
00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.125
Okay, someone should look out the hole.

926
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.281
I ain't looking out that hole!

927
00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.408
Last person looked through that
hole got his head chopped off!

928
00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:56.690
Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
Whatever is out there might still be out there.

929
00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.080
Okay, I know, I know.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

930
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.209
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

931
00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.524
There's a lookout!

932
00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.488
Jesus Christ! Look, there's a
huge fucking hole down there!

933
00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.369
What the fuck is this?

934
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.520
Where's the thing that killed the guy?

935
00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.641
I don't know.

936
00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.881
How'd his head fall off?

937
00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.200
And where's the rest of him?

938
00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.046
Hi.

939
00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.804
This is James Franco,

940
00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.000
in my house, in my library.

941
00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:41.522
We've been stuck here for about 24 hours.

942
00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.001
Danny McBride is here.

943
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.520
I didn't even invite him to my party,

944
00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.166
but he came and
passed out in the bathtub,

945
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.323
and I got to say
it's, like, typical fucking McBride.

946
00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:55.530
Like, I've been feeling
really weird about him lately.

947
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.604
Like, I don't really know if
I want to be friends with him,

948
00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:02.526
and then he fucking
showed up at my party,

949
00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:07.208
and now, we're stuck here
with him in disaster lockdown, so...

950
00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.726
What up? What's going on?

951
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.211
Hey, Danny. What's up, man?

952
00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.800
Not much. What are
you doing'? What is this?

953
00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.360
Oh, it's just a video confessional.

954
00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.445
Fuck that dude.

955
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.964
- Earthquakes cause tsunamis.  
- Yes.

956
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:31.441
Tsunamis cause other tsunamis, disaster.

957
00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.522
I mean, for all we know,
the fucking Lakers could have just won,

958
00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.011
and that's the reason
why all this is happening.

959
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.048
Hole in Franco's front yard? Sinkhole.

960
00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.488
Every single time I turn on
the news, sinkhole in South America.

961
00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.204
Bunch of South Americans
getting sucked into the ground.

962
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.725
- Sinkhole de Mayo.  
- Sinkhole de Mayo.

963
00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.881
That's why it's named that,

964
00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.524
because sinkholes happen in the summertime.

965
00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.605
It's not wildfires. 
It's not earthquakes. 
It's not sinkholes.

966
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:51.806
I think I know what it is.

967
00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.881
Let's hear it.

968
00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.087
I think it's the Apocalypse.

969
00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.640
What?

970
00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:03.529
I'm serious, boys. 
It's all in here, in the Book of Revelations.

971
00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.567
You took my Bible?

972
00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.641
Well, just hear me out,

973
00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.960
and you tell me that what I'm describing

974
00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.805
isn't what's going on right now.

975
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.568
"And the skies shall open up, and
the light of the Lord shall shine down,"

976
00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.405
"and those of good heart shall
be brought into my kingdom of heaven."

977
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:20.883
That's the Rapture, those are
the gigantic beams of blue light.

978
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.281
"And there will be a
great mountain burning in fire."

979
00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:26.807
I mean, the Hollywood Hills
are literally engulfed in flames

980
00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.291
as we sit here right now.

981
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.931
The Hollywood Hills ain't
no mountain. It's a hill.

982
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.206
Takes about 10 minutes to get across

983
00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.441
that motherfucker with no traffic.

984
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.760
- Coldwater.  
- I take Laurel Canyon.

985
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.767
- Cahuenga.  
- Cahuenga.

986
00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.729
- I usually zip down Barham.  
- Boys, can I just fucking finish?

987
00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.086
I love Laurel Canyon.

988
00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.000
"And out of the pit rose
a great red dragon having seven heads,"

989
00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.851
"that old serpent called the devil and Satan,"

990
00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.810
"which deceiveth the whole world,"

991
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.451
"was released onto the earth."

992
00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.721
I love that dude. 
He's from Where the Wild Things Are.

993
00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:55.841
It's a load of bullshit.

994
00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.967
It's not bullshit.

995
00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.326
Want to know something else, Jay?

996
00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.481
If this is the end of the world,

997
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.164
and all the good people died,

998
00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:05.450
what you're saying is Seth, me, Jonah, 
Craig and Danny

999
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.561
are a bunch of assholes.

1000
00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.802
I'm straight-up lovable, son.

1001
00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.646
And if this really is the Apocalypse,

1002
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.767
you're here, too.

1003
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.722
So, that means you're just as
shitty as the rest of us.

1004
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.931
Doesn't feel too good, does it?

1005
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.006
Hey, guys. I'm going to sleep now.

1006
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.445
Nobody come in here and bother me.

1007
00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.081
Go fish.

1008
00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.844
Put it back inside of here.

1009
00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.843
- Do you know what it is?  
- Yeah.

1010
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.127
Now you ask me
for something that you need.

1011
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.611
First bit.

1012
00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.006
You're not cutting it all?

1013
00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.811
That's smart. You're divvying it up first.

1014
00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.923
This is like, Fruyere
or some shit. That's me.

1015
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.047
Come on, Danny!

1016
00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.520
You licked your finger. Come on, man.

1017
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.691
If they're all equal, what does it matter?

1018
00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.125
Keep your hands and fingers off.

1019
00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.167
- Seth?  
- Yeah.

1020
00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.969
- Can I talk to you for a second?  
- Yeah, yeah.

1021
00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.451
Yeah, no shit.

1022
00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.327
Here. Off the menu, my man.

1023
00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.682
Holy shit, man. 
Where did you get these?

1024
00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.287
Hey, what's cheese without a few crackers? 
Know what I'm saying?

1025
00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.249
- Hide it.  
- Okay.

1026
00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.885
'Cause we're a team.

1027
00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.041
Okay.

1028
00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.009
Freaks forever, brother.

1029
00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.288
Let's do all the drugs.

1030
00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.203
I don't really want to.

1031
00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.921
Should have thought of that before
you drank a can full of ecstasy.

1032
00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:30.801
What?

1033
00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.571
# I fly like paper,
get high like planes #

1034
00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.126
# If you catch me at the
border I got visas in my name #

1035
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.329
# If you come around here, 
I make 'em all day #

1036
00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.641
# I get one down in
a second if you wait... #

1037
00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.447
Should we call Red? 
Get more weed?

1038
00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.285
Oh, I don't know, man. 
That guy's gone crazy.

1039
00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:27.604
Good thing I have a lot
of fucking weed for you guys.

1040
00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.921
I hooked you guys up.

1041
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.891
Now I need you
guys to assassinate Woody Harrelson.

1042
00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.606
If pot's legalized, my business will suffer.

1043
00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.001
And if my business suffers, I suffer.

1044
00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.161
So much suffering.

1045
00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:43.084
All 'cause of that inbred hemp seed, 
Woody Harrelson.

1046
00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.003
I have to do what's right.

1047
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.526
Weed is for the people. 
It's the people's weed.

1048
00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.840
- If you don't assassinate him...  
- We already quit.

1049
00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.406
I'm gonna assassinate both of you.

1050
00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.805
Run! Go!

1051
00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.645
# And take your money #

1052
00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:01.087
# All I wanna do is... #

1053
00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.050
B.F. F. F. F. F.
F. F. F. F. F. Forever.

1054
00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.406
B.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.

1055
00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.685
Look out! Shit!

1056
00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.768
You're letting them get away!

1057
00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.961
I smoked weed with Steve Jobs,

1058
00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.281
and that's when he
came up with the iPad.

1059
00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.564
It's pretty great.

1060
00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.400
We should make sequels
to more of our movies.

1061
00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:30.487
Yeah!

1062
00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.164
How 'bout we not do Your Highness 2?

1063
00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.765
Yeah. Do 128 Hours.

1064
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.161
- The beginning of the rest of your comedies.  
- Looks good.

1065
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.445
Oh, my God!

1066
00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.206
Emma! It's Emma.

1067
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.806
Oh, my God, you guys are alive.

1068
00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.167
You're actually alive. Thank God!

1069
00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:58.005
I hid in a drainpipe for days.

1070
00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.970
Like, three or four. 
I don't even know how many.

1071
00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.530
And then I stopped hearing people,

1072
00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.284
and I started hearing growling noises.

1073
00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.762
Out there, in your travels, uh,

1074
00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.126
did you see anything that you would describe

1075
00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.725
as Apocalyptish?

1076
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.529
I mean, no,

1077
00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:17.407
but, uh, I would say it's
completely obvious what's going on here.

1078
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.046
I mean, it's a zombie invasion.

1079
00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.770
- Fuck!  
- I'm the one who said it's been zombies.

1080
00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.609
- You said zombies?  
- I said zombies the whole time.

1081
00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.001
- You said zombies?  
- I don't think... 
You never said zombies.

1082
00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.088
Wait a second. 
You guys haven't been proven right.

1083
00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.400
These are still just theories.

1084
00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:32.051
Honestly, I'm just so relieved
that you guys are here,

1085
00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.169
and I'm very happy about
the idea of sleeping and just...

1086
00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.241
- You tired?  
- Yeah.

1087
00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:39.085
If you want to take a little rest,

1088
00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.162
you're welcome to do that upstairs.

1089
00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.526
- Thank you.  
- Cool.

1090
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.170
- I'll show you the way.  
- Thank you.

1091
00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.163
Thanks, guys. Seriously, you're awesome, really.

1092
00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.810
You're awesome.

1093
00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.646
So fucking tight.

1094
00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.001
We'll be right out here, okay?

1095
00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:54.561
Fuck are you guys doing out here?

1096
00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.887
Here's what I think we should do. 
She's British, right?

1097
00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.689
She's used to eating shitty food anyway.

1098
00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.649
Let's just give her all the
shitty food that we don't want.

1099
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.245
That's fucked up. 
Look how tiny she is.

1100
00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.243
She's not even a full seven. 
She's, like, half a seven.

1101
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.641
This is a fucking cool thing, man.

1102
00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.011
I, for one, am very excited.

1103
00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.923
I'm a massive Harry Potter fan.

1104
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.082
- What?  
- Yes. I love fucking Harry Potter.

1105
00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.605
I cannot wait till she wakes up

1106
00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.364
and I can ask her
all these amazing questions about

1107
00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.646
how they made those motion pictures.

1108
00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:16.767
Take it easy, Dumbledore.

1109
00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:19.730
Guys, listen, listen. 
I think we need to

1110
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.529
address the elephant in the room.

1111
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.364
Whoa. Jay, don't talk about Craig like that.

1112
00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.010
That's fucked up. 
I'm right here, man. Yeah.

1113
00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.208
I'm not calling Craig an elephant.

1114
00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.320
Wow, that's fucking weird.  
- What does that even mean?

1115
00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:30.600
- Yeah, no.  
- That's racist.

1116
00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.806
I wasn't referring to him.

1117
00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:35.282
I was referring to the issue
that's on all of our minds.

1118
00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.646
What?

1119
00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:40.042
This is one girl in
a house with six males.

1120
00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.281
Yeah. Really safe.

1121
00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.486
Ideal scenario.

1122
00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.641
She's like a little sister.

1123
00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.165
I think that she needs...

1124
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.969
It's important that she feels safe.

1125
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.530
- Yeah.  
- And comfortable.

1126
00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:49.965
And we should be mindful.

1127
00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.371
Who's making her not feel safe?

1128
00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.885
Well, I'm just saying, we should...

1129
00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.327
We don't want to
give off a bad vibe.

1130
00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:56.925
Vibe? Vibes? I ain't giving no vibes.

1131
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.650
Yeah, wait, what kind of
vibes are you talking about, man?

1132
00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.609
He's talking about us
giving off a rapey vibe.

1133
00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.284
- Hey! Shh!  
- Whoa! What?

1134
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.209
Jesus. Jay, what the fuck, man?

1135
00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:05.441
Chill out, dude.

1136
00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.409
- Why you putting that shit in the mix?  
- Yeah.

1137
00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:09.244
- He fucking said it.  
- You're the one saying it.

1138
00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.731
No one here is thinking about raping anyone.

1139
00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.450
Shh! Well, you talking about vibes

1140
00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.364
is the only thing that's
rapey going on right now.

1141
00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.363
Dude, nothing was rapey till
you brought up the rapey vibes.

1142
00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.442
- Fucking one who smelt it dealt it, dawg.  
- True that, dude.

1143
00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.931
One who denies it supplies it.

1144
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.002
I know, it's farts, I get it.

1145
00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.241
Guys, guys, guys.

1146
00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.924
Jay's not rapey.

1147
00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.441
Jay couldn't rape a fly.

1148
00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.249
He probably could.

1149
00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.203
Maybe we should just stop
this entire conversation right now.

1150
00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:33.004
If anyone's gonna rape anyone here,

1151
00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.411
it's probably gonna be Danny.

1152
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.891
- What the fuck, Franco?  
- What?

1153
00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:37.371
Why do you think I'm gonna rape somebody?

1154
00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.329
I'm just trying to lay it out there.

1155
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:40.765
I'm not gonna rape anyone, all right?

1156
00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.126
If anyone's gonna rape somebody, it's Jay.

1157
00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.764
- What?  
- He came up with the rape idea.

1158
00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.046
And his face looks like the police sketch

1159
00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:46.280
- of a fucking rapist.  
- True.

1160
00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.526
What the fuck does that mean?

1161
00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.204
If anybody's raping Emma Watson,

1162
00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.406
it's fucking Sir Rapes-a
-Lot over here.

1163
00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.601
- Chill out.  
- Hey!

1164
00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:52.966
Whoa!

1165
00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.041
Easy. Easy.

1166
00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.201
Back the fuck up!

1167
00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.566
Emma. What's wrong?

1168
00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:57.721
- Wait, what's wrong?  
- What's wrong?

1169
00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:58.926
I just heard you guys talking about

1170
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.490
which one of you is
gonna get to rape me.

1171
00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:01.971
No, no, no, no!

1172
00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:03.485
Guys, I got it. I got it.

1173
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.841
No. It's funny. It's funny.

1174
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.880
We were specifically talking about not raping you.

1175
00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.246
Jesus! Holy shit!

1176
00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.084
Back up!

1177
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.130
It's me, Jonah!

1178
00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.690
It's me, Jonah Hill.

1179
00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.331
America's sweetheart. J-bug, J-bone.

1180
00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:20.241
- Your friend. 
I would never hurt you.  
- Get back!

1181
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.882
Give me everything you have to drink! 
Put it in the bag!

1182
00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:25.769
There's six of us. 
You cannot rob us!

1183
00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:27.080
I'm not fucking around!

1184
00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.850
Give her drinks! 
Give her drinks!

1185
00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:31.325
Put the drinks in a bag!

1186
00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.442
Oh, God. Get all
the drinks in a bag!

1187
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.851
Hurry the fuck up!

1188
00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.126
Okay, they're getting the drinks.

1189
00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.248
- Put the ax down.  
- Don't give the Milky Way away.

1190
00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.243
All right, you can
put the ax down now.

1191
00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:41.401
Now, Franco! Shoot her face!

1192
00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:42.606
Shoot her!

1193
00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:44.250
I'm not gonna shoot Emma Watson!

1194
00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.970
Look, Emma, just stay here with us.

1195
00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.690
It's a lot safer than out there.

1196
00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.280
Hermione just stole all of our shit.

1197
00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:00.046
Little bitty-ass 20-year-old jacked us.

1198
00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:03.442
And then Jay suggested that we
all rape her, and now she's gone.

1199
00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.841
I didn't... I was just... I...

1200
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:09.049
I think the only reason why
he did that is because Jay knows

1201
00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.531
he's about fucking two minutes away

1202
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.204
from becoming the house bitch himself.

1203
00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:16.205
So now, motherfuckers is thirsty.

1204
00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.289
All right, guys.

1205
00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.124
The door to the basement's out there,

1206
00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.611
around the side of the house.

1207
00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.008
I know for sure there's
at least two jugs of water.

1208
00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.570
Okay.

1209
00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:27.641
Uh...

1210
00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.806
Any volunteers?

1211
00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.681
Does anyone want to
volunteer and go with Jay?

1212
00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:32.807
What?

1213
00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.803
I thought you said, "Someone volunteer
to go with me out there."

1214
00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:35.881
I must have misheard you.

1215
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.923
- I'm sorry.  
- You did not, you motherfucker.

1216
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.411
Hey, okay, ease up.

1217
00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.051
Just chill out, dude. 
Just relax, man. God.

1218
00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.963
So how we gonna decide this, fellas?

1219
00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.441
All right, guys, it's simple.

1220
00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:49.922
Whoever pulls the burnt match
has to go get the water.

1221
00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.084
Who wants to go first?

1222
00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.360
I'll do it.

1223
00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.566
Craig.

1224
00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:06.250
All right.

1225
00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.685
Go ahead, brother.

1226
00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.931
No whammies, no whammies.

1227
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.765
- Hey, hey.  
- Yes! Yeah!

1228
00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.683
Yes!

1229
00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.928
- Whoo!  
- Fuck, yes. Fuck, yes.

1230
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.048
- So sorry, Craig.  
- A lot of guys in here

1231
00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.481
that I wish it was instead of you.

1232
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.644
You want to go
best two out of three?

1233
00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:34.247
If I tug, if I pull in
anyway, or if you hear me screaming,

1234
00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.721
anything, you pull me
right back in, all right?

1235
00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.643
Yeah. We'll try, man, but you're pretty heavy.

1236
00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.441
What?

1237
00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.285
No, I mean, I'm saying, 
I just don't think it's smart

1238
00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:44.805
- to make any guarantees.  
- Fuck, no.

1239
00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.564
- You promise to pull me back in.  
- No, no, we're...

1240
00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:47.801
- You got me?  
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1241
00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.205
- We're gonna do our best.  
- All right.

1242
00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:50.884
- You want to do a test run?  
- Yeah.

1243
00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.561
You gotta scream. 
Let us hear the scream.

1244
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.250
Pull.

1245
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.765
Nice. Very nice.

1246
00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:56.966
Everyone thank Craig for doing this.

1247
00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.804
- Thanks, Craig.  
- Thank you, Craig.

1248
00:50:58.880 --> 00:50:59.881
Go for it, Craig.

1249
00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.962
Getting smoky in here. 
Go, go, go, go.

1250
00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.329
This is fucked up.

1251
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.843
Goddamn.

1252
00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:21.922
Smoky as fuck out here.

1253
00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:41.887
Rope burn! Ah! Ooh!

1254
00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.644
Grab it, grab it, grab it!

1255
00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:44.960
Oh, no, no, no, no!

1256
00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.087
Shit. Oh, no.

1257
00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.202
Shit. Shit.

1258
00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.166
Come on, motherfucker. Shit!

1259
00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:02.730
Fuck this shit.

1260
00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:11.490
Fellas, fellas! Pull me in! 
Pull the rope!

1261
00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.170
- Pull me in!  
- We don't have the rope anymore!

1262
00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.601
We fucking dropped it! We're sorry!

1263
00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.801
You've got the rope, man!

1264
00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:17.211
What?

1265
00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.444
- Craig!  
- What the fuck do we do?

1266
00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.284
Craig! Craig!

1267
00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.041
Are you okay?

1268
00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.167
What happened, man?

1269
00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.880
I don't know! There's something out there.

1270
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:36.761
Oh, shit!

1271
00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.968
A knife! Somebody throw me a knife!

1272
00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.326
I'll get it.

1273
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.241
Why?

1274
00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.845
Jay, I'm so sorry, bro.

1275
00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:51.921
The fuck?

1276
00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.280
Cut it! Cut it! Cut
it! Cut it! Cut it!

1277
00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:59.126
God! What the fuck was that?

1278
00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.326
I don't know what the fuck that was,

1279
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:01.566
but I ain't going back out there.

1280
00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:02.721
Craig, you didn't even
get any of the water.

1281
00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:03.801
The door was fucked up.

1282
00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:06.042
Damn it, this is so frustrating!

1283
00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.407
It's so close, but so far.

1284
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.563
The water, it's, like, right underneath us.

1285
00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:13.290
Like, right there.

1286
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:16.125
What do you mean "right underneath us"?

1287
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.488
Like, literally, like, right there.

1288
00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.210
If you went right through the floor.

1289
00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:34.845
Yo.

1290
00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:39.323
Danny and Jonah's shift ends in ten
minutes, so our break is almost over.

1291
00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.331
Okay.

1292
00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:42.800
Let me ask you something.

1293
00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:46.800
You really think this is

1294
00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.370
the Apocalypse?

1295
00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.920
You saw something out there, didn't you?

1296
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:56.450
All right, let's just say for
sake of argument, what if I did?

1297
00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.648
What if this is the
real shit, right now, happening?

1298
00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:02.120
What if it is, man? 
We're not prepared for this.

1299
00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.163
- What do we do? What's next?  
- It says in the Bible,

1300
00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.163
"The worthy will ascend to Heaven."

1301
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:11.451
Even if it is the Apocalypse,
it's not the end of us.

1302
00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.090
There's still hope.

1303
00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:16.403
We just have to somehow
try to prove our worthiness.

1304
00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:18.767
Okay, so, you mean, like,

1305
00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:22.287
like the Ten Commandments,
like, do shit unto people

1306
00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:23.600
that'll do the same shit to you.

1307
00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:25.409
That's a great place to start.

1308
00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:26.891
You know, to just overall love.

1309
00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:30.043
Just be nicer and follow those commandments.

1310
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:32.441
Listen. We're gonna get through this.

1311
00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:33.841
We're gonna get through this, man.

1312
00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:36.565
You know why? Cause
we're gonna do it together.

1313
00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.846
You promise?

1314
00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.206
We're gonna do this.

1315
00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:42.962
I hear everything.

1316
00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:55.003
Who did this?

1317
00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:56.445
Who did this?

1318
00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.761
Did what? What are you talking about?

1319
00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:01.446
Jizzed all over the
pages of this nice magazine.

1320
00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:03.483
I was nice enough to tell you about.

1321
00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.210
Was it you, Seth?

1322
00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.441
No.

1323
00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:07.931
- No?  
- It was me, Franco.

1324
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.128
I fucking made jizz in your magazine.

1325
00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:12.009
- Why?  
- When I fucking jack off

1326
00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.809
long enough, I end up jizzing, dude.

1327
00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:16.451
I'm assuming the same shit works for you?

1328
00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.171
Real fucking smart answer! 
Why don't you fucking aim, huh?

1329
00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:22.449
I have a particularly explosive ejaculate. 
It just goes everywhere.

1330
00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.409
It's like a fucking wild fireman's hose.

1331
00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.050
You just got to grab
on and pray to God

1332
00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:27.451
it doesn't get in
your eyes or your mouth.

1333
00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.170
The fuck kind of jerking off is that?

1334
00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.241
What, you never had any brothers?

1335
00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.926
You didn't learn to jizz in a
fucking sock or on a fucking tissue?

1336
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.764
No, I don't have any brothers.

1337
00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.285
I was raised in a house of women!

1338
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:38.124
I highly doubt they fucking taught you

1339
00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:40.851
to fucking close your eyes
and fucking cum wherever you want!

1340
00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:41.967
I mean, you're getting all worked up

1341
00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.610
over a fucking porno mag!

1342
00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:45.921
Who has goddamn porno mags anymore?

1343
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.321
Welcome to the 21st century, Buck Rogers!

1344
00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:51.250
You designed a house with
fucking iPads in the walls,

1345
00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.761
yet you're jerking your
dick like a goddamn pilgrim!

1346
00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.366
That's right, man. 
I like to fucking read!

1347
00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.520
You think that's the only
thing I jerked off in here?

1348
00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:00.520
I've been dropping loads around this fucking house

1349
00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:01.766
like a goddamn dump truck.

1350
00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:03.330
You don't cum on my stuff!

1351
00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.004
I'll cum wherever the fuck I want, James.

1352
00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.366
I'll fucking cum in your kitchen.

1353
00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:07.646
I'll cum on your fucking art.

1354
00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:09.290
I'll cum anywhere I want!

1355
00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.044
I will fucking cum right on you!

1356
00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.487
I will cum like a
fucking madman all over you, McBride!

1357
00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:16.325
Ooh. I fucking wish you'd
cum on me right now.

1358
00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.765
I fucking dare you to cum on me!

1359
00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:20.241
God!

1360
00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.527
I'm gonna jack my dick
so fucking hard in here!

1361
00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:25.166
This, no more, man. 
All over your fucking face.

1362
00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.288
This fucking all more. 
All over the fucking place!

1363
00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.010
I'll fucking cum anywhere I want!

1364
00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.411
I'll fucking cum on these walls!

1365
00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.970
I'll cum on the fucking cabinets!

1366
00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:33.610
On the fucking furniture! 
I'll cum everywhere!

1367
00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:35.444
If I see your dick one more time,

1368
00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:36.885
I'm gonna fucking shoot it off!

1369
00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.769
You don't have enough bullets, bitch.

1370
00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:41.366
No fucking jerking off in my house, McBride!

1371
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.129
- Come on, man.  
- Fuck this.

1372
00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:47.850
I'm just... I'm too thirsty to do this.

1373
00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.200
And the fucking bitter irony is

1374
00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:51.447
I'm not gonna have my
thirst quenched until I finish this.

1375
00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.045
- God damn it, I hate it.  
- Danny, no.

1376
00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:54.531
Don't walk away. 
Danny, don't walk away from me!

1377
00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:57.649
It's too late, Seth. 
I've already walked away too much.

1378
00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.489
No, you haven't. 
You could still come back

1379
00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:02.131
and just fucking turn around
and come back and help me.

1380
00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.326
Danny?

1381
00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:07.246
Daniel?

1382
00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:17.851
Need a hand?

1383
00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:19.726
Yeah, dude.

1384
00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:20.767
Your shift just ended, man.

1385
00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:22.251
You don't have to help
me if you don't want to.

1386
00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.481
It's fine. I get it.

1387
00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:25.324
The fuck else am I doing?

1388
00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.528
I appreciate it, man. Thank you.

1389
00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.045
- Done and done.  
- That's cool.

1390
00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:37.931
I don't know why I'm thinking
of this, but remember that time

1391
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.800
that I got you a
fucking Taco Bell gift certificate

1392
00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:43.564
for, like, 20 bucks, and I bet you

1393
00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.648
that you couldn't eat all
of that in one sitting.

1394
00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:47.484
I do remember that. 
I remember thinking,

1395
00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.840
"How much food could 20 dollars

1396
00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:50.245
possibly buy you at Taco Bell?"

1397
00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:51.765
And the answer is infinite.

1398
00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:53.842
And we went to see fucking "Gladiator".

1399
00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:54.967
Yeah.

1400
00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:57.486
And you sharted midway through the movie.

1401
00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.210
- I did.  
- Due to the tigers' appearance.

1402
00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:00.845
- I got scared of the tigers.  
- Yeah.

1403
00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:02.410
Literally, when the second
tiger came out, I went...

1404
00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.845
and then I shat.

1405
00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:05.251
I shat in the theater.

1406
00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:14.242
Jesus. Oh, fuck.

1407
00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:15.731
You guys okay?

1408
00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.450
- I broke my ass in half.  
- Here.

1409
00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.045
Shit, they got through!

1410
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.327
- You guys fucking did it.  
- Oh, my God.

1411
00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:22.401
Fuck. Did that hurt?

1412
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:23.766
Oh, yes, it fucking hurt.

1413
00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.842
I loosened this up for you, 
I'll have you know.

1414
00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:27.729
Okay, just shut up. 
It's fucking dark down here.

1415
00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:30.246
Hold on, hold on.

1416
00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.201
Nice.

1417
00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:34.243
Okay, good. Thank you. What is that?

1418
00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:37.005
That's Terrence Peterson. 
My monkey flashlight keychain.

1419
00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.804
- Monkey flashlight keychain?  
- Mmm-hmm.

1420
00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.450
- What's his name?  
- Terrence Peterson.

1421
00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:41.931
- You see it, Seth?  
- No. Where...

1422
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.331
Are you sure it's even down here?

1423
00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:44.447
Terry Pete.

1424
00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:45.851
Uh, not sure.

1425
00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:47.251
Is there, is there
any weird shit down here?

1426
00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:50.210
Nah, it's where I keep all
my stuff from my old movies.

1427
00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:51.520
Costumes, props.

1428
00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.450
What? Is someone down there?

1429
00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:07.729
It's your fucking stupid cutout from Spider
-Man 3.

1430
00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:09.325
Jesus Christ.

1431
00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.447
No shit!

1432
00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:11.641
- There it is!  
- Yes! Yeah!

1433
00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:13.643
- What, did you find it?  
- Yeah!

1434
00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:17.210
# La-da-da-da-dah #

1435
00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:19.282
# It's the motherfucking D
-O-double
-G #

1436
00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:20.731
# Snoop Dogg #

1437
00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:22.211
# La-da-da-da-dahh #

1438
00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:24.527
# You know I'm
mobbin' with the D.R.E. #

1439
00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:25.886
Water.

1440
00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:29.050
Mmm!

1441
00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.242
That is so fucking good.

1442
00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:32.765
The two heroes over
here, breaking through the floor.

1443
00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:34.365
We did break through the floor.

1444
00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.363
Any of you guys would
have done the same thing.

1445
00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:38.761
Oh, man. That fucking hurt.

1446
00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:41.008
Yeah, I'm surprised you didn't shart again.

1447
00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:42.241
I think I did.

1448
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.163
Hey, what year is this? 19...

1449
00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:45.880
That's a good... 
That's a good year.

1450
00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:47.206
Hey, hey. Yo, yo, yo!

1451
00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:48.964
Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
What are you doing?

1452
00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:50.121
What am I doing?

1453
00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:52.925
Fuck, man.

1454
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.923
I'm just pouring myself another glass of water

1455
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.968
to wash down that dry-ass Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

1456
00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:58.280
That's very nice, but you can't just

1457
00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.040
pour yourself another glass of water, man!

1458
01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.161
Will you cut it out?

1459
01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.527
Yeah. We agreed to one glass at dinner,

1460
01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.761
we voted on it, man.

1461
01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.080
Well, man, I'm just getting sick and tired

1462
01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.525
of all these fucking rules, man.

1463
01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.011
You don't see me
putting rules on you guys.

1464
01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.447
You cannot have another glass of water.

1465
01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.568
Jay weighs 150 pounds less than me.

1466
01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.529
Why the fuck is it fair

1467
01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.489
that him and I should
drink the same amount of water?

1468
01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.289
We should be dividing our rations

1469
01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.249
based on our proportionate size.

1470
01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.800
I don't want to come off
as a diva here or anything.

1471
01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.120
It's just that I think everyone

1472
01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.486
should split everything equally.

1473
01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.767
"I just think that everybody
should have the fucking same."

1474
01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.922
"I have a goddamn earring."
Shut the fuck up, Jonah!

1475
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.729
You know what, Danny? 
If you weren't jizzing

1476
01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.643
all the time, maybe you'd be more hydrated.

1477
01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.324
You're making me into
a joke right now, Franco,

1478
01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.209
and you are not gonna
like the fucking punch line.

1479
01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:41.204
No more jerking off! No more water! 
Just sit the fuck down!

1480
01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.611
Okay, I'm done.

1481
01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.886
We're not gonna have any more water.

1482
01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:44.961
- Good.  
- All right.

1483
01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.564
Hey!

1484
01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.564
Someone help me! 
Fucking grab it!

1485
01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.560
What are you doing?

1486
01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.680
You guys made this happen!

1487
01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.200
You guys forced my fucking
hand by ganging up on me.

1488
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.250
God damn it, I'm
gonna fucking kill this motherfucker!

1489
01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.766
That's what I thought. Nerd.

1490
01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.040
All right, guys,

1491
01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.206
let's get rid of him.

1492
01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.611
What? What do you mean?

1493
01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.205
Like, kick him out of the house?

1494
01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.045
His fucking reckless behavior
is dragging us all down.

1495
01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.122
I mean, he wasted our water twice.

1496
01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.083
Two times. Two times.

1497
01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.680
Dan is under a lot of pressure. Okay?

1498
01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.524
And he's not handling it as
good as the rest of us are.

1499
01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.331
Look at him. He's wearing my fucking tuxedo.

1500
01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.004
He's been eating nonstop.

1501
01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.447
The fucker's gained weight since he got here.

1502
01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.522
The fucker's got to go.

1503
01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.601
Go.

1504
01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.284
The fucker's got to go.

1505
01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.370
This is how you all feel?

1506
01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.726
We talked about it.

1507
01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.690
You guys are gonna
vote me off the island?

1508
01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:59.684
I mean, I made you guys breakfast.

1509
01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.047
Shit, man, you wasted half of
our food when you did that.

1510
01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.851
Just thought I was doing
something nice for you guys.

1511
01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:08.208
Just to apologize for
my behavior at the party.

1512
01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.651
Party I wasn't even invited to.

1513
01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.928
I'm not an idiot.

1514
01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.006
I know why you guys don't fucking
call me or hang out with me anymore.

1515
01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.169
It's because I party so fucking hard.

1516
01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.649
Always have. Ever since I was a baby.

1517
01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.449
I wouldn't just suck on my mama's titties.

1518
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.649
I would fucking bang 'em and motorboat 'em.

1519
01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.367
Everything I've been doing has
just been a cry for help.

1520
01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.250
When I came on your magazine, James,

1521
01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.288
it was a cum for help.

1522
01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:40.160
I've just been crying and
comin' and crying and comin',

1523
01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.081
tears from the tip of my penis, dudes.

1524
01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.124
I'm sorry, all right? 
You can cum wherever you want.

1525
01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.646
I don't even care about cumming anymore.

1526
01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.606
Right now, I'm just kind of into going.

1527
01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.444
Danny. Danny.

1528
01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:56.601
Hey. Come on, man.

1529
01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.205
I fucked up.

1530
01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:59.520
I'm sorry, man. 
Come on, look,

1531
01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.324
- I was wrong.  
- I feel like shit, man.

1532
01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.890
I didn't want it to happen like this.

1533
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.081
Let's just discuss it some more, okay?

1534
01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.446
Yeah. Let's just talk, dude.

1535
01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.205
We're giving you an option. 
It's a choice, man.

1536
01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.123
There's nothing to figure out, all right?

1537
01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.885
You guys have said enough,
and there's no going back anymore.

1538
01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:17.044
I don't know if there maybe is,
like, something you guys could give me

1539
01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.726
so I could at least have some
sort of protection while I'm out there.

1540
01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.121
Danny, you don't have to do this.

1541
01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.611
- Yeah, man.  
- All right,

1542
01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:24.886
if you're really leaving

1543
01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.282
then you should take this.

1544
01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.050
Really?

1545
01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.441
You don't know what's out there.

1546
01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.444
Thank you, James.

1547
01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:41.722
It means a lot to you, and
I appreciate that you'd give this to me,

1548
01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.643
you stupid, stupid motherfucker!

1549
01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.725
Fucking psychopath. 
It's a prop gun!

1550
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.370
What, do you think I'd
put real bullets in here?

1551
01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.761
You were gonna send me
out there with a fucking gun

1552
01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:54.887
- filled with blanks?  
- Oh, fuck you!

1553
01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.200
Don't turn this around on us.

1554
01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.282
You just tried to
shoot us, you fucking dickhead!

1555
01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.407
Fucking murdering motherfucker!

1556
01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:01.847
Whatever. Fucking civilization is broken down.

1557
01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.321
There's no more reason for this false bullshit.

1558
01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.323
You guys act like you're
so fucking high and mighty,

1559
01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.687
like you've never made a goddamn mistake before.

1560
01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.728
Franco, you're just a pretentious fucking nerd.

1561
01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:11.847
Fuck you.

1562
01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.001
And, Jonah,

1563
01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.445
you fucking cunt.

1564
01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.209
Craig, you didn't have my back, back there.

1565
01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.448
- You fuckin' disappoint me.  
- Bro.

1566
01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.285
And, Seth, you duplicitous taint.

1567
01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.284
- What?  
- Then of course, there's Jay,

1568
01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.921
the self-righteous, cock-sucking, two-faced backstabber.

1569
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.729
What the fuck are you talking about?

1570
01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:34.569
I overheard your little
conversation with Craig, all right?

1571
01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.961
The only reason why you
care about any of us is

1572
01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.690
because you think that's what
God wants you to do.

1573
01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.125
You don't give a shit about us.

1574
01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.328
No, no, no, no,
that's fucking twisting that shit...

1575
01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.401
You're fucking lying.

1576
01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:44.845
Am I twisting this?

1577
01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:47.764
I believe you were in Los Angeles

1578
01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.683
two months ago, at the Four Seasons.

1579
01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:53.242
I saw you there, and you
specifically asked me not to tell Seth,

1580
01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.886
so that you could maintain the illusion

1581
01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.405
that you always stay with Seth

1582
01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.561
when you're in Los Angeles.

1583
01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.290
Ooh!

1584
01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.526
Jay.

1585
01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.329
- Fuck, man.  
- It's not...

1586
01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.721
Textbook twattage.

1587
01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.802
And just for the record, you guys,

1588
01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.167
I'm choosing to leave,
you're not kicking me out.

1589
01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.368
You guys had already said
that I could come back in

1590
01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.647
and I'm the one who said
that I'm not coming back in.

1591
01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.006
Don't be cocky.

1592
01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.805
Get the fuck out of here.

1593
01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.130
Is that true?

1594
01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.247
Yes.

1595
01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.685
Jay...

1596
01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.410
I know this is probably my fault

1597
01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.891
because I put you on a pedestal,

1598
01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.645
but you should not
be dishonest with your friends.

1599
01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.802
But you really let me down.

1600
01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.450
Hey! Whoa! Jay, damn, man.

1601
01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.887
- Fucker.  
- What the hell?

1602
01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.849
It's all fucked, isn't it?

1603
01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:49.925
- Jonah, you okay?  
- Yeah.

1604
01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.731
Bleeding?

1605
01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:56.521
Yeah.

1606
01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:03.085
His insides hurt worse than my outsides.

1607
01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.211
Dear God,

1608
01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.207
I'd like to pray
to You for a second.

1609
01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.964
It's me, Jonah Hill.

1610
01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.644
From Moneyball.

1611
01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:28.363
I hate Jay so fucking much.

1612
01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:31.410
I think he might be
the worst person You ever created.

1613
01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:35.007
I don't want to judge You, but...

1614
01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:38.323
What's up? What were You thinking that day?

1615
01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:42.962
I love Seth, I love being
his friend, he's an awesome guy,

1616
01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.327
but it's like Jay is the last connection

1617
01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:48.927
to his shitty, weird Canadian life.

1618
01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:51.844
Just do me one favor, God.

1619
01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:55.804
Just kill Jay.

1620
01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.804
That'd be so tight.

1621
01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.929
Stop, man.

1622
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.162
Seriously, Craig, stop.

1623
01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.563
Your nails are sharp.

1624
01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.841
This is no dream!

1625
01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.087
This is really happening!

1626
01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:23.206
No!

1627
01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:39.925
Something, um, not that chill happened last night.

1628
01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:45.204
Yo, so, I just drank my
own pee for the first time.

1629
01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:50.283
And it ain't bad. 
I never thought to do it.

1630
01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.489
I always thought, you
know, pee stink, whatever, but...

1631
01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:54.965
Shh.

1632
01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:13.403
I think we all remember how this works.

1633
01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:15.642
Whoever gets the burnt match has
to go to one of Franco's

1634
01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.643
neighbors' houses, get us
some food and some water.

1635
01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.563
No... ho... ho. No, 
I'm not going first.

1636
01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.130
- I'll go first.  
- Thank you.

1637
01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.964
Very mature of you. Thank you.

1638
01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.765
Yes!

1639
01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:30.569
Sorry.

1640
01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:32.681
Good job.

1641
01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:37.606
You okay, Jonah?

1642
01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:38.727
What's that?

1643
01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:39.881
You okay?

1644
01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:43.404
Yeah. Just bad sleep. Crazy dream.

1645
01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.766
Here, Jonah.

1646
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.365
Jonah.

1647
01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.522
- Okay.  
- Shit.

1648
01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.090
Craigers, you feeling lucky?

1649
01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.890
Will history repeat itself?

1650
01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.687
Thank you.

1651
01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.006
You got this, dawg.

1652
01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:13.247
Seth! No! Not you!

1653
01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.401
I'm not going.

1654
01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.887
- What?  
- I'm not going.

1655
01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.246
I'm bowing out. 
I'm declining to go.

1656
01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.367
What?

1657
01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:27.600
Let me break it down for you.

1658
01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.444
I'm not fucking going.

1659
01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.568
You are definitely going. 
Tell him he's fucking going.

1660
01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.927
Tell you what, why don't you fucking go, Mr. Self
-Righteous?

1661
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.446
You're constantly saying what assholes
we are, how good you are.

1662
01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:38.090
You go get us some fuckin' water.

1663
01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.326
I will go.

1664
01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:46.130
Because I have

1665
01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.089
- something called honor.  
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1666
01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:49.969
That's good. Yeah, you're very honorable.

1667
01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:51.765
I'll go with you, Jay.

1668
01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.001
Really?

1669
01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.481
Is it because of our pact upstairs?

1670
01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:58.006
Nah, 'cause you got them skinny-ass arms.

1671
01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.128
You couldn't carry enough to feed a hamster.

1672
01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.647
It's working.

1673
01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.525
Let's get that money.

1674
01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.170
Let's do it.

1675
01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.001
Yo. Out and to the left. Shh-shh.

1676
01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.527
Bye.

1677
01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:26.851
Oh, my God.

1678
01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:28.200
What?

1679
01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.370
That's so sad.

1680
01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.688
Innocence lost.

1681
01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.085
What is that?

1682
01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:42.327
Fire.

1683
01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.890
There's, like, fire everywhere.

1684
01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.246
Damn it!

1685
01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.565
Hey, hey!

1686
01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.647
Fuck, yeah. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1687
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.529
- Hello?  
- Shut the fuck up!

1688
01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:10.290
- What?  
- You yelling that shit for?

1689
01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.089
- We got to find out...  
- Don't yell no more, man.

1690
01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.162
Crack you in the
head with this frying pan.

1691
01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:18.245
Okay. So we should probably
split up, cover more ground.

1692
01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.607
What you think this is, Scooby
-Doo?

1693
01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.370
We're gonna go in there,
we're gonna find the kitchen,

1694
01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.169
and get as much
shit as we can, together!

1695
01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.401
Then we're getting the fuck out of here.

1696
01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.249
- All right, all right.  
- All right?

1697
01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:31.961
Hey.

1698
01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.686
Hey.

1699
01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.364
What are you doing?

1700
01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:37.647
That should be me out there.

1701
01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.449
I totally fucked those guys.

1702
01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.445
Mmm.

1703
01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:43.921
Fuck was that?

1704
01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.443
- Oh, fuck!  
- Is he okay?

1705
01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.681
- Dude!  
- Jonah!

1706
01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.205
- What the fuck?  
- What do we do?

1707
01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:51.930
- Do you know first aid or anything?  
- No.

1708
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.081
- Jonah!  
- I suck at first aid.

1709
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.446
Are you okay? Shit! Jonah?

1710
01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:56.363
Oh, no. Low blood sugar. LBS.

1711
01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.283
LBS! He's having an LBS episode!

1712
01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:00.408
- I'll get the Milky Way!  
- You get the Milky Way!

1713
01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.687
Ugh!

1714
01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:10.810
Jay.

1715
01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.562
Jonah, stay with me! Stay with me.

1716
01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.563
I got it, I got it, 
I got it, got it, open his mouth.

1717
01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:18.926
- It's your friend, Seth.  
- Open his mouth.

1718
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.480
Open his mouth. Open his mouth. 
I'll get this in there.

1719
01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:22.891
Okay, okay. Shove it right in there.

1720
01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.485
Jonah. Milky Way, Jonah.

1721
01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.085
You love the Milky Way. Yummy, yum.

1722
01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:27.491
It's not fucking working, man!

1723
01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:28.561
What the fuck!

1724
01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:29.766
How do we get it in there?

1725
01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:33.003
Chew it up, chew it up and
spit in his mouth like a baby bird.

1726
01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.721
Mmm!

1727
01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:35.880
You just swallowed it, man.

1728
01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:36.921
It's so good.

1729
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.604
Give me a bite.

1730
01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:39.761
Mmm!

1731
01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.525
The second it hits
your mouth is, like, amazing.

1732
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.162
- Okay.  
- Open it.

1733
01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.164
What the fuck was that?

1734
01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.288
- That's Hebrew.  
- That's not Hebrew.

1735
01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.725
It's fuckin' Latin or something like that.

1736
01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.041
I went to Hebrew school for six years. 
That's not Hebrew.

1737
01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:04.121
You will drown in a river of blood.

1738
01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:06.123
The End of Days is here.

1739
01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:09.124
You will quiver in
the shadow of Kingdom Come.

1740
01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.124
Judgment Day is upon you.

1741
01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:16.489
The Apocalypse is nigh!

1742
01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.008
Hey, I think that's all it could fit.

1743
01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:25.770
Man, let's take this back to
Franco's, get the fuck out of here.

1744
01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.046
Uh, uh...

1745
01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.966
What are we going back for?

1746
01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.121
What are you talking about?

1747
01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:34.171
In theory, we could just fuckin' stay here.

1748
01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:37.164
And here, you don't have to sleep

1749
01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:40.130
in a friggin' tent under a dick.

1750
01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:41.565
I like my dick tent.

1751
01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:42.687
I'm just saying,

1752
01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:46.560
we could build a life here together, Craig. 
I'd be really good to you.

1753
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.923
All I know is I'm scared as hell,

1754
01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:51.805
and I just want to
get back to our friends.

1755
01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.160
Yeah, but they're not my friends.

1756
01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.527
Seth is your friend.

1757
01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.807
We've been growing apart for years.

1758
01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.491
That's why I didn't stay with
him last time I was here.

1759
01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:02.006
And I stayed with him this
time to try and salvage it,

1760
01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.844
but clearly that didn't work out.

1761
01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:06.571
Jay, like it or not,

1762
01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.929
those assholes are all we got.

1763
01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:13.961
Did you hear that?

1764
01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.565
Yeah, that was a creak.

1765
01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:22.682
What is that?

1766
01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.088
What is that? Is that bile? Ew!

1767
01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.248
I don't know. It's cold.

1768
01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:29.560
Sniff it.

1769
01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:32.120
No. You sniff it.

1770
01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.207
Ew!

1771
01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.964
- What?  
- It smells like puke.

1772
01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.041
Ew! Ew!

1773
01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.770
Don't get it on me! Ew!

1774
01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:50.771
- It's in my eyes!  
- Dude!

1775
01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:53.161
- It's in my mouth!  
- He's gone!

1776
01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:55.402
- Where is he?  
- He's fucking gone!

1777
01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:57.727
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

1778
01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.806
Please, God! Jesus, Jesus!

1779
01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:18.441
Fuck.

1780
01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.929
- Jonah!  
- Jonah!

1781
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.082
Jonah, stop this!

1782
01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.770
Please! Jonah, where the fuck are you?

1783
01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.490
Why did you vomit on us!

1784
01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.843
Bad Jonah! Stop!

1785
01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.763
Stop eating him!

1786
01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.842
Watch out! He's super strong!

1787
01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:36.961
Aah!

1788
01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.441
Shit!

1789
01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:41.682
What is happen...

1790
01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:42.921
Oh, no!

1791
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.764
I'm gonna tittie-fuck you, Seth.

1792
01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.285
Don't tittie-fuck me!

1793
01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:47.805
What are they, big B's or small C's?

1794
01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.451
I'm gonna push your titties together.

1795
01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:52.170
Push 'em together!

1796
01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.810
I'll get you something to help!

1797
01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:54.881
I'll pass you something!

1798
01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.041
Okay, pass it to me.

1799
01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:58.648
Ow! Fuck! Shit!

1800
01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:02.681
Aah! Oh!

1801
01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:05.806
Seth!

1802
01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:09.362
We're getting crazy!

1803
01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:16.566
Come on! Come on!

1804
01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:20.486
Jesus, open, God damn you, open!

1805
01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.643
No, no, no, no.

1806
01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.885
Jesus...

1807
01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.767
Oh, fuck.

1808
01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.924
- We gotta hide. 
We gotta hide.  
- I know!

1809
01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.411
He's coming! He's coming!  
- I know he's coming!

1810
01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:41.010
I don't know what the fuck to do!

1811
01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.809
I don't know...

1812
01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:44.565
Where are you going?

1813
01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:46.564
Shit.

1814
01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:57.088
- Please go away.  
- He's sniffing.

1815
01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:58.880
I'm so scared, James.

1816
01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.046
Be quiet.

1817
01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.329
- You're breathing really loud.  
- Am I?

1818
01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:05.240
- Don't breathe through your mouth.  
- Okay.

1819
01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:10.084
- Now you're doing loud nose breathing.  
- Am I?

1820
01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.969
I don't know where else to breathe from.

1821
01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.726
- Is that...  
- Seth.

1822
01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:21.364
Oh, shit. Don't move.

1823
01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.090
Oh, shit, he's coming
right this way. Oh, shit.

1824
01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.446
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1825
01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.963
Get out of my way! Move! Move!

1826
01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:36.008
Fuck!

1827
01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.121
You Okay?

1828
01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:41.361
Come on!

1829
01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:45.485
- Let's go. Let's go.  
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

1830
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.809
What the fuck! 
What are you doing?

1831
01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:51.325
What are you doing? 
What are you doing?

1832
01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:52.890
There's a fuckin' demon chasing us!

1833
01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.564
- A demon?  
- Demon?

1834
01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:57.484
- What the fuck happened to you guys?  
- That!

1835
01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.971
It's Jonah! He's possessed!

1836
01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.320
He's crazy!

1837
01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.647
Oh, fuck! You brained him.

1838
01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.449
Is that... I was
supposed to do that, right?

1839
01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:06.601
Yeah.

1840
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.843
Motherfucker.

1841
01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:14.090
- Fasten!  
- Hurry!

1842
01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:15.525
Fasten, God damn you, bastard!

1843
01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:16.681
He's gonna be fuckin'

1844
01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:18.085
bad news when he wakes up!

1845
01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:20.003
He's fuckin' strong.

1846
01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.764
My side's good. Oh, shit!

1847
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.410
All right, I'll fuckin' hit him.

1848
01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:25.090
- Fuck!  
- Come on, come on!  
- Okay!

1849
01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:32.966
This shit's cray cray, guys.

1850
01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:36.250
I mean, it's, like, the real, like Apocalypse.

1851
01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.641
It's, like, the Book of Revelations,

1852
01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:40.882
like that means there's a God.

1853
01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:42.291
Right?

1854
01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.045
I haven't led my life as
though there's a God this whole time.

1855
01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.600
Who fuckin' saw that coming? 
That there's actually a God?

1856
01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:51.002
I'd say 95% of the planet.

1857
01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:54.648
Jesus fucking Christ, man.

1858
01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:56.808
You might want to
stay away from saying that.

1859
01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:59.326
"Jesus fucking Christ"? Why?

1860
01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:01.124
- Why can't I say that?  
- One of the Ten Commandments.

1861
01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:04.044
"Thou shall not take the name
of the Lord thy God in vain."

1862
01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.565
Jesus isn't the name of the Lord.

1863
01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:06.846
God is name of the Lord.

1864
01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.968
Jesus, God, it's all the same.

1865
01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.361
It's the Trinity. Father, Son, Holy Ghost.

1866
01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.329
It's like Neapolitan ice cream.

1867
01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.004
I don't even know
what the fucking Commandments are.

1868
01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:19.244
Guys, I think this is sort
of bullshit, because we're all good people.

1869
01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:22.484
I can look at each one of you in the eye, 
I know you're good.

1870
01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:24.210
- I'm good.  
- We're four actors.

1871
01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:26.248
We bring joy to people's lives.

1872
01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.049
Yeah, but we don't do it for free.

1873
01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:32.330
We get paid handsomely, much
higher than the average profession.

1874
01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.201
It's not like it was
just handed to any of us.

1875
01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:35.890
We've worked really hard to be here.

1876
01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:38.088
Yeah, pretend like it's hot when it's cold.

1877
01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.762
You sitting on the beach, it's freezing,

1878
01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:44.925
you in your drawers,
talking about something, everybody's surfing.

1879
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.207
I think God might have just fucked up,

1880
01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:50.329
made a mistake, and
left us behind by accident.

1881
01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:52.408
I mean, He's got a
lot of shit on His plate.

1882
01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.563
It's not an oversight,
it's not a mistake, okay?

1883
01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:59.804
We got to face facts. 
We're here, and there's a reason we're all here.

1884
01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:02.201
Why are you so sure?

1885
01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.362
I've done things, man. I...

1886
01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:09.244
I gouged a man's eyeballs out.

1887
01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:11.084
- What the...  
- Fuck off.

1888
01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:12.924
- Craig.  
- Well, I was a kid, man.

1889
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.207
It was a fuckin' bar fight.

1890
01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.611
It was a bad foosball game.

1891
01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:19.365
He said I didn't call
spinneys, and I fuckin' called spinneys.

1892
01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:22.284
He got all in my face, and
I smashed a bottle across his face...

1893
01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.884
and the first eyeball was an accident,

1894
01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:27.611
but then I was, like, fuck it,
and I went for the second one.

1895
01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:29.728
It was fucked up. 
But you know what?

1896
01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:34.249
That shit happens. 
I'm saying, that's... 
I think that's why I'm here.

1897
01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.408
I got to admit something.

1898
01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.766
I, uh...

1899
01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:41.051
I fucked Lindsay Lohan.

1900
01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:44.004
She was fucked up. She was high.

1901
01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:45.360
It was at the Chateau Marmont,

1902
01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:46.680
and she kept banging on my door.

1903
01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.969
She kept calling me Jake Gyllenhaal.

1904
01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:51.326
That's fucked up.

1905
01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:54.927
Yeah, I said, "Call
me the Prince of Persia."

1906
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.206
See, that's what I'm saying, man.

1907
01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.248
We've all done bad shit, you know?

1908
01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:01.927
We've done more bad shit
than good in our lives, and

1909
01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:06.164
it's time to pay the piper.

1910
01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.281
Whoa, shit!

1911
01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:10.362
Something's wrong.

1912
01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.651
God did this.

1913
01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:16.321
He gave us light, and
then he took it away.

1914
01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.765
You hear that?

1915
01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.922
It's the soundtrack of us going insane.

1916
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.844
Damn, I wish there was something
we could do to help him.

1917
01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:25.530
I know what we can do.

1918
01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.249
The fuckin' stench.

1919
01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:51.041
Jonah Hill?

1920
01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.091
Jonah?

1921
01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:58.691
Jonah Hill.

1922
01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.888
Jonah Hill is no more.

1923
01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:03.246
Demon?

1924
01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.163
Yes?

1925
01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:07.163
Fuck. That's not good.

1926
01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:08.526
That's not good.

1927
01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.810
Jay, you fool.

1928
01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:13.360
I say unto thee,

1929
01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:16.326
the power of Christ compels you!

1930
01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.244
Oh, does it? Does it compel me?

1931
01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:21.368
The power of Christ compels you!

1932
01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:22.441
Does it, Jay?

1933
01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:24.443
The power of Christ compels you!

1934
01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:26.522
Is the power of Christ compelling me? 
Is that what's happening?

1935
01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:29.160
The power of Christ compels you!

1936
01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:31.686
Guess what? It's not that compelling.

1937
01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.922
Jay, you serious right now?

1938
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.287
That's your fuckin' plan? 
You're gonna repeat lines from The Exorcist?

1939
01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.562
I would assume they did their fuckin' research.

1940
01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:40.483
- It's a movie!  
- It's a manual.

1941
01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:42.640
It's a fuckin' training manual.

1942
01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:45.845
I say unto thee,

1943
01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:48.600
the power of Christ compels you!

1944
01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:50.887
The power of Christ compels you!

1945
01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:53.882
The power of Christ compels you!

1946
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.525
Geez, it hurts a little bit.

1947
01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:56.840
It's, like, this little sting.

1948
01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:59.361
The power of Christ compels you!

1949
01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.521
Seriously, fuck off.

1950
01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.126
The power of Christ compels you!

1951
01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:06.811
Jay?

1952
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.684
The power of Christ compels you!

1953
01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:09.807
Holy shit!

1954
01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:11.410
You're pissing him off, man. Just stop it!

1955
01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.289
- Jay!  
- The power of Christ compels you!

1956
01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.609
- The power of...  
- Get the fuck down!

1957
01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.768
- Don't fucking push me, asshole!  
- Geez, man!

1958
01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:20.841
- Fuck you!  
- Easy!

1959
01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:22.001
You're a fucking asshole, you liar!

1960
01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:23.081
Still?

1961
01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:24.161
- Yes.  
- Still?  
- Yes.

1962
01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:25.725
Guys, guys, we got a possessed guy here!

1963
01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.404
Do we have to
argue about this right now?

1964
01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:28.447
Let 'em fight.

1965
01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:30.045
We got an exorcism to finish. Hello?

1966
01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.400
Do you want to know
why I didn't stay with you?

1967
01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:33.050
- Yeah.  
- You fuckin' changed.

1968
01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:36.010
You're a fuckin' sell-out.

1969
01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:38.321
You did fuckin' sell out. 
Everyone says.

1970
01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:42.246
- At least I did change!  
- You act like you're fucking 18 years old still, Jay!

1971
01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:44.641
- Grow up, Jay.  
- That's why he's yelling at you.

1972
01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:46.808
You've been holding me back this whole time!

1973
01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.450
That means fuck you.

1974
01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:50.568
Come on, guys! Come on!

1975
01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:53.922
Fuck you, you piece of shit!

1976
01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:58.486
Everybody, out!

1977
01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.800
Craig, stop 'em!

1978
01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:01.689
- Get apart!  
- Oh, now it's on.

1979
01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:04.161
Yo! What the fuck is all this, Franco?

1980
01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:07.120
Uh, looks like food. 
How'd that get there?

1981
01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.561
What? You have more food?

1982
01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:10.846
You knew he had extra food?

1983
01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:12.649
Yeah, he gave me one cracker.

1984
01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.290
I would have sucked a
dick for half a cracker.

1985
01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.601
All right, well, maybe I didn't want
you to suck my dick, all right?

1986
01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:17.846
- Look...  
- I didn't want to suck it!

1987
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.604
- That's the point of what I said!  
- It was my fucking food!

1988
01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:20.681
Guys, guys, guys, fire!

1989
01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:21.807
Boys, boys, boys...

1990
01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:23.922
Shit! Jonah's on fire!

1991
01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:31.051
Put it out!

1992
01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:32.531
Use your mouth! Put it out!

1993
01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:42.885
Go, go, go, go, go!

1994
01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.370
Where is he? Where
is he? Where is he?

1995
01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.601
Go, go, go!

1996
01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:58.804
Go, go, go, go, go!

1997
01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.644
Go, get outside!

1998
01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:02.643
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

1999
01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:03.721
Go, go on!

2000
01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:05.882
Come on, hurry up, he's coming!

2001
01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.644
He's coming!

2002
01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:22.450
Watch out, watch out!

2003
01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:25.121
Oh, my fortress!

2004
01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:28.884
Uh, boys, I just
want to point out, um,

2005
01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:30.450
we're out in the open now.

2006
01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:32.286
Oh, fuck. Shit, shit, shit.

2007
01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:34.522
- Oh, shit.  
- Hey, hey, hey.

2008
01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:35.726
My Prius. Yeah!

2009
01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:37.609
Yeah! Yes!

2010
01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:41.841
What is that?

2011
01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.602
No fucking way.

2012
01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:46.688
We're screwed!

2013
01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.240
We're totally screwed, guys.

2014
01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.081
I got this.

2015
01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:54.730
- What?  
- I'll distract the thing.

2016
01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:56.768
I'll run over there screaming and shit,

2017
01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:00.447
and that should give you enough
time to get to the garage.

2018
01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.164
Well, yeah, but that thing can kill you.

2019
01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:05.642
Maybe I deserve it. 
I've been shitty my whole life.

2020
01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.961
Being selfish, only doing shit for me.

2021
01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:10.361
Maybe it's only right that
the last thing I do

2022
01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:13.523
on this planet isn't for me.

2023
01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.000
It's for you guys.

2024
01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.809
Craig, you don't have to do that.

2025
01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.211
Thank you very much, Craig.

2026
01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:20.044
I appreciate that. 
You spineless...

2027
01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:22.683
I love you guys.

2028
01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:24.530
You're my best friends.

2029
01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:26.602
You're a real mensch, Craig.

2030
01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:28.887
See you on the other side.

2031
01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.489
Hey, hey, asshole! Hey, come on!

2032
01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.642
Pickle dick, demonic-looking motherfucker.

2033
01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.848
Nobody's scared of you. 
You ain't a raccoon!

2034
01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:42.729
Yeah, bring your ass, bitch!

2035
01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.690
Nobody's scared of you! 
I'm Craig fucking Robinson!

2036
01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.006
Yeah.

2037
01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:48.241
- What's he gonna do?  
- Craig.

2038
01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:51.409
I hope you like big dick, motherfucker,

2039
01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:53.323
'cause I'm about to fuck you raw!

2040
01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:55.687
For the last goddamn time!

2041
01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:57.804
Take your panties off!

2042
01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:10.290
Fuck, yeah!

2043
01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:13.607
It worked.

2044
01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:15.205
What's happening?

2045
01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:17.282
Craig! Craig!

2046
01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:33.369
Holy shit, do you
guys realize what this means?

2047
01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.001
That Craig was an angel this whole time?

2048
01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:37.930
- No, no, it means we can still be saved.  
- No, no.

2049
01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:42.770
I don't fucking get it, why
does Craig get saved? I mean...

2050
01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:45.207
Craig sacrificed himself for us,

2051
01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:47.089
which means that there's still hope.

2052
01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.009
- That means we can be redeemed.  
- Yeah.

2053
01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:50.809
It means that if we're
actually nice to each other,

2054
01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:53.685
we can get sucked up into Heaven, too. 
That's the deal.

2055
01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:55.484
All right, I got
it, let's just head out

2056
01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.847
- to my place in Malibu.  
- Yeah.

2057
01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:01.083
Just survive long enough until
we do enough good things

2058
01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:03.208
and they accumulate or do enough sacrifices,

2059
01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:04.406
and we'll all go to Heaven together.

2060
01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:06.448
That's a great idea, James.

2061
01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:08.210
Seriously, really, really good idea.

2062
01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:10.123
Really, you're such a smart guy.

2063
01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.248
Thanks, Seth, you're such a nice guy.

2064
01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:13.561
You got a great smile.

2065
01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:15.324
- Thanks, man.  
- And an awesome laugh.

2066
01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.408
- I've heard it's annoying.  
- How about that Jay back there, man?

2067
01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:19.090
- Dude, Jay, you kidding me?  
- Come on. Oh, come on.

2068
01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.486
- One of a kind.  
- Get out of here.

2069
01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:21.766
You got a cool body.

2070
01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.330
You can walk around
with your shirt off anytime.

2071
01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:25.050
It's not working, this isn't working.

2072
01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:26.961
What, you thought we would be Raptured already?

2073
01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:28.087
I thought it would happen already.

2074
01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.286
No, we've just been talking nice.

2075
01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.249
Talking nice doesn't get you into Heaven.

2076
01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:33.448
Doesn't hurt to smile...

2077
01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.081
What the fuck?

2078
01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:38.491
You guys okay?

2079
01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.289
- Oh, shit.  
- Christ.

2080
01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:51.965
- Franco!  
- Come on!

2081
01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:56.530
Yo, cut his fucking head off!

2082
01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:57.726
What's going on?

2083
01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:01.048
No!

2084
01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:02.360
- No!  
- Stop!

2085
01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:21.041
Danny?

2086
01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:22.326
What the fuck?

2087
01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:23.526
You guys are still alive?

2088
01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:24.721
Yeah.

2089
01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.882
Holy shit, I didn't expect that.

2090
01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.883
Fuck out here.

2091
01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:30.847
Get...

2092
01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:32.724
- Shit, I can't believe you guys are here.  
- Oh, Jesus.

2093
01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:36.566
That's fucking crazy, and your
timing couldn't be more perfect.

2094
01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:39.526
It's been a long time
since any of us have eaten,

2095
01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:42.410
and you three gentlemen look delicious.

2096
01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:43.606
What does that have to do with us?

2097
01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:45.523
The fuck are you talking about?

2098
01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:47.284
I'm a cannibal, hombre.

2099
01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.169
We're gonna fucking eat your ass.

2100
01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.810
Fuck you, you can't eat us. 
Fuck that, man.

2101
01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.724
I do whatever the fuck
I want, when I want.

2102
01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:55.404
I butt-fucked this dude.

2103
01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:57.561
See that?

2104
01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:59.244
I fucking slide right in that shit.

2105
01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.085
I do whatever I want. 
This is my gimp.

2106
01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:03.730
Channing, introduce yourself.

2107
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.081
Hey, what's up, guys?

2108
01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:06.571
Y'all cool?

2109
01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:08.091
That's Channing Tatum.

2110
01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:09.924
That's Channing Tatum, dude. 
What the fuck?

2111
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.128
Channing fucking Tatum. 
I found him wandering on the freeway.

2112
01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:14.885
I collected him, made him my bitch. 
Get off my dick.

2113
01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:17.804
I call him Channing Tate-yum.

2114
01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:18.961
Hard-core, man.

2115
01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:20.121
I got him trained good.

2116
01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.850
Watch, he does tricks. 
Wait, shake hands.

2117
01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:23.126
All right, Seth.

2118
01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:24.446
Fucking roll over.

2119
01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:26.010
- I'm gonna create a diversion.  
- Yeah.

2120
01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.969
- You and Jay make a run for it.  
- What?

2121
01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:29.610
Danny's gonna eat you.

2122
01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:32.650
Listen, full-on sacrifice for you, dawg,

2123
01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:34.800
- like the ending to Pineapple 2.  
- Yeah, lick that.

2124
01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:36.444
That's Channing fucking Tatum, dawg.

2125
01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:38.046
I love him.

2126
01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:41.090
That's fucking G.I. Joe, dude. 
Fucking loves me.

2127
01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.926
Danny! We're friends! 
You can't eat us!

2128
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.528
I'd love to catch up, but
we're fucking starving, so let's eat!

2129
01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:49.687
Fuck you!

2130
01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:52.885
Run!

2131
01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:56.167
Eat this!

2132
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.685
Ow! Shit, fuck! Get him!

2133
01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:02.160
Who wants it, you piece of shit?

2134
01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.566
Man, we should go back.

2135
01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.560
We should go back and help him. 
We should go back.

2136
01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:09.847
Fucking Rapture.

2137
01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:11.922
Holy shit! It worked!

2138
01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:17.925
What the fuck?

2139
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.321
Go to hell, McBride!

2140
01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:22.004
Fuck you!

2141
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.923
Suck my dick!

2142
01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:27.607
Ah...

2143
01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:29.566
Oh!

2144
01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:32.010
- Oh, shit.  
- What happened?

2145
01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:34.242
What did I do? Take me back!

2146
01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:35.321
What did I do?

2147
01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:36.401
I'll tell you what happened, Franco.

2148
01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.522
You don't get to
get sucked up into Heaven

2149
01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:41.968
'cause you were being petty. Tom Petty.

2150
01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:43.963
You may not have
invited me to your party,

2151
01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:46.364
but you're the guest of honor at mine.

2152
01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:47.487
What?

2153
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.331
How fucking crazy is this?

2154
01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:58.169
Seth, Jay!

2155
01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:59.844
Oh, shit, they're running after us.

2156
01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:02.645
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Run.

2157
01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:04.210
Bring them to me!

2158
01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:06.647
- Fuck.  
- Get 'em!

2159
01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:09.003
Got to get Rogen.

2160
01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:11.287
Over here.

2161
01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.164
- What?  
- Over here, over here. Here.  
- What?

2162
01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:16.005
Shit, shit.

2163
01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:18.569
They're around here somewhere.

2164
01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:20.600
They kept running, you fucking idiots.

2165
01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:22.564
Shit, are they still there?

2166
01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:24.165
- I think they're gone.  
- Are they gone?

2167
01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:26.123
- Oh, my God.  
- Why did Franco flip off Danny?

2168
01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:27.804
Why did he have to do that, man?

2169
01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:28.927
He was in the clear.

2170
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.525
That is textbook.

2171
01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:32.125
Vanity or...

2172
01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:33.440
- Is it vanity?  
- Vanity or envy.

2173
01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:34.885
Is it envy or wrath?

2174
01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:37.008
- It's any of them, man.  
- You can't do that.

2175
01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:38.650
It's being a sore
winner, is what it is,

2176
01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:40.051
more than anything. 
That's exactly what it is.

2177
01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:41.360
- You can't be a sore winner.  
- No.

2178
01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:45.686
Well, this is another fine
mess we found ourselves in.

2179
01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:50.241
Fuck.

2180
01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:51.886
Listen, Jay...

2181
01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.849
Oh, shit.

2182
01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:58.082
Get out of here,
let's get out of here.

2183
01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:05.563
Oh, you've got to be fucking shitting me!

2184
01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:09.361
- Oh, my God.  
- Oh, no.

2185
01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:10.646
That thing's big.

2186
01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:11.846
Holy shit.

2187
01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:13.206
Oh, it's so big.

2188
01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:17.171
- Oh, man.  
- Oh, Jesus.

2189
01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:26.486
- We're gonna die, man.  
- Okay.

2190
01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:27.641
- Okay, we're gonna die.  
- Uh...

2191
01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:35.083
- Jesus!  
- Oh, no!

2192
01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:41.921
- Shit.  
- Listen to me, man.

2193
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.731
I'm a fucking idiot. 
I put myself up.

2194
01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.131
I'm self-righteous.

2195
01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:47.730
- I think I'm better than you.  
- No, no.

2196
01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:48.961
I was resistant to change.

2197
01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:51.048
- No.  
- I should have grown with you.

2198
01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:53.088
I should have changed with you.

2199
01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:54.486
We should have changed together.

2200
01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:57.928
I didn't like what I became
so I hated what you became.

2201
01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.764
It's fine, man. It's fine.

2202
01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:01.689
- I love you, Seth, fucking love you, buddy.  
- I love you, man.

2203
01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:03.245
- I always loved you.  
- Let's die together, man.

2204
01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:05.163
- Let's die together.  
- I love you, Jay.

2205
01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:17.365
Holy shit, Jay, all right!

2206
01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:18.487
Yeah, we did it!

2207
01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:19.965
I'm not getting sucked up into Heaven!

2208
01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:21.246
What do you mean? Why not?

2209
01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:22.924
I don't know why not!

2210
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.081
Take my hand!

2211
01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:25.400
Okay, take me with you, Jay!

2212
01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:27.050
I'll take you with me.

2213
01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:28.650
Ah! Yay!

2214
01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:30.324
Yeah!

2215
01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:31.527
Ah!

2216
01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:32.647
Whoo!

2217
01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:35.845
Yeah! It's working!

2218
01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.160
Yeah!

2219
01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:47.091
Oh, no! He sees us!

2220
01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:51.407
He can't touch us!

2221
01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:53.084
We're in a force field!

2222
01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:59.846
Oh, shit! Shit!

2223
01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:05.244
It's not gonna take me with you!

2224
01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:06.446
We're going down!

2225
01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:09.444
Keep holding on and
you'll get pulled up, too!

2226
01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:11.443
It's not! No, I won't, man!

2227
01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:13.204
I don't deserve to.

2228
01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:15.046
Fuck.

2229
01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:19.966
I'm gonna let go, Jay.

2230
01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:21.201
You'll die!

2231
01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:23.726
I know, but you won't.

2232
01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:25.040
No!

2233
01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:28.044
I don't deserve to go
to Heaven, but you do.

2234
01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:29.531
You do, okay?

2235
01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.489
We're both gonna die
if I don't let go.

2236
01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:35.401
I'm not gonna hold you back anymore.

2237
01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:39.170
No!

2238
01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:48.722
# And I... #

2239
01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:55.009
# will always love you. #

2240
01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:57.051
Yay!

2241
01:36:57.240 --> 01:36:59.288
# I will always #

2242
01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:02.882
# love you. #

2243
01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:07.887
# I will always love you. #

2244
01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:14.562
Whoo! Yeah!

2245
01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:17.526
Come, hold my hand, buddy!

2246
01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.602
Hold my hand!

2247
01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:21.563
- Yeah!  
- You did it!

2248
01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.250
- You did it!  
- Yeah!

2249
01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:24.560
You did it!

2250
01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:26.961
Yeah!

2251
01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:32.608
We're flying!

2252
01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:35.605
# Love you. #

2253
01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:50.808
# When I die and
they lay me to rest. #

2254
01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:54.602
# Gonna go to the
place that's the best. #

2255
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.924
# When I lay
me down to die. #

2256
01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.047
- Look!  
- What?

2257
01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:00.807
Wow.

2258
01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:07.689
Welcome to Heaven, motherfuckers.

2259
01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:10.170
Craig!

2260
01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:13.643
- Yay!  
- Yeah!

2261
01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:15.610
- Craig.  
- Oh, my...

2262
01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:16.681
What?

2263
01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:17.841
This is awesome.

2264
01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:19.604
- Are you an angel?  
- Yes, sir.

2265
01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:21.205
- That's so cool, man.  
- That is so cool.

2266
01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:22.850
Congratulations, dude.

2267
01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:24.201
Ah, fellas.

2268
01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:26.009
- Yeah.  
- Yes.

2269
01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.845
- Oh!  
- Dude, you got one.

2270
01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:29.001
- What?  
- That's so cool.

2271
01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:30.201
- Do I have one?  
- Do I have one?

2272
01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:31.401
- I can't see it.  
- Do I have...

2273
01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:33.005
Wait. Let's touch 'em.

2274
01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:35.485
- Dude, this is so...  
- Wow.

2275
01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:37.164
- What do we do now?  
- Yeah.

2276
01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:38.481
Come this way.

2277
01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:39.800
Ooh...

2278
01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:42.726
# So you know
that when you die. #

2279
01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:45.009
# He's gonna recommend you. #

2280
01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:46.923
# To the spirit in the sky. #

2281
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.411
# Spirit in the sky. #

2282
01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:51.723
Right? Do you love it? 
Do you love it?

2283
01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:54.727
Whoa, they got weed in Heaven?

2284
01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:56.609
- What?  
- You tell me.

2285
01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:58.207
Oh! What?

2286
01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:01.290
Holy shit! That's awesome!

2287
01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:03.801
Oh.

2288
01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:05.041
Wow.

2289
01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:06.650
That's insane, man.

2290
01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:08.085
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2291
01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:10.766
That's Heaven. 
Anything you could think of is yours.

2292
01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.166
Whoa!

2293
01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:16.971
Holy shit, this is awesome.

2294
01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:18.087
Segway!

2295
01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.844
I've always wanted to
ride one of these things.

2296
01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:22.127
Go ahead, Jay, make a wish.

2297
01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:23.321
Anything you could think of.

2298
01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:25.211
Anything?

2299
01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:29.926
# Everybody, yeah. #

2300
01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:33.491
# Rock your body, yeah. #

2301
01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:34.561
What?

2302
01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:37.802
No fucking way.

2303
01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:39.405
# Everybody. #

2304
01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:41.642
