00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:05.061
(eerie music)

2
00:00:18.341 --> 00:00:21.008
(ominous music)

3
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.450
- [Narrator] Let's talk about black

4
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.270
unemployment rate okay.

5
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.910
It is the lowest it's ever been.

6
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.360
Obama couldn't even do that.

7
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.115
Nobody could come close.

8
00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:46.832
(ominous music)

9
00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:54.090
You know what I think we should do?

10
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.050
We should have a new show
called Mexican Ninja.


11
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.610
I mean 'cause they're strong.

12
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.900
That's why I'm gonna make the wall

13
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.223
very very tall, okay?

14
00:01:04.273 --> 00:01:06.053
Because it could climb that easily.

15
00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:18.370
- [Narrator] When the
crowd heard that Reagan


16
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.542
was the projected winner,
here's what happened.


17
00:01:21.592 --> 00:01:22.506
- [Narrator] Ronald Reagan is the winner

18
00:01:22.556 --> 00:01:25.094
for the 1980 election
and our next president!


19
00:01:25.144 --> 00:01:29.894
(cheering)
(owl hooting)


20
00:01:30.835 --> 00:01:31.618
- [Narrator] Well the night is young

21
00:01:31.668 --> 00:01:33.447
as far as the celebration is going here.

22
00:01:33.497 --> 00:01:36.370
In an hour or so they're planning
a fireworks demonstration.


23
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.513
- Paging Scorchy McDaniels!

24
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.053
He gone?

25
00:01:41.103 --> 00:01:44.096
- Yes my husband is gone, Jermajesty.

26
00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:45.290
Now get that big 10-inch over here.

27
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.240
- 10?

28
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.890
Girl you must need glasses.

29
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.247
You seein' double.

30
00:01:49.297 --> 00:01:50.080
(screaming)

31
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.160
- [Scorchy] He won't be back for hours.

32
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.340
We have all night.

33
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.290
- Music to my ears!

34
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.010
I love these girls.

35
00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.843
- Wait.

36
00:01:58.893 --> 00:02:00.530
Have you seen little David?

37
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.323
I wouldn't want to traumatize him.

38
00:02:03.395 --> 00:02:05.021
- He's right there.

39
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:06.626
(screaming)

40
00:02:06.676 --> 00:02:09.700
He's been watching us through
the window this whole time.


41
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.420
Look at this little shit head.

42
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.590
Trying to hide like we can't see his

43
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.670
pig-face motherfucking ass.

44
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.400
- He gets that from his father's side.

45
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.380
- Why'd you have him anyway?

46
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.400
- Having that little
turd was my one way

47
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.243
ticket to the Barron Empire.

48
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.023
Look what Freddy got me today.

49
00:02:29.718 --> 00:02:31.135
It cost $130,000!

50
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.870
- Scorchy, I stand
corrected, nicely played.


51
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.103
- Now, I want to feel
a supernova in my womb.


52
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.360
- We are gonna go intergalactic
black hole type of shit!


53
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.210
- Yes!

54
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.130
- They are gonna have
to peel your ass off

55
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.480
the ceiling in the morning!

56
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.963
Big bang times 10 type of shit!

57
00:02:56.681 --> 00:02:58.903
- [Narrator] The way it is going tonight.

58
00:02:58.953 --> 00:03:01.414
In all my years I
think it's not too early

59
00:03:01.464 --> 00:03:06.281
to talk about one of Reagan's
presidencies might be like.


60
00:03:06.331 --> 00:03:08.210
- [Narrator] Well Will,
I was reared to beware


61
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.210
of the man who caused (speaks too low).

62
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.140
- [Narrator] What can you expect from

63
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.771
a Reagan administration other
than Jimmy Carter's scalp?


64
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:20.290
- [Narrator] Well I
think we'll see a lot

65
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.782
of businesses coming to Washington--

66
00:03:22.832 --> 00:03:25.499
(ominous music)

67
00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:28.028
- Woo hoo!

68
00:03:28.078 --> 00:03:29.820
I will see you in the morning!

69
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.600
- [Scorchy] I'll be waiting.

70
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.037
You were amazing!

71
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.763
- God damn right I was.

72
00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:39.286
Jermasty you are a devil dog.

73
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.597
I can see you.

74
00:03:45.303 --> 00:03:47.060
You are one dumb kid.

75
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.840
And take that Ronald Reagan mask off.

76
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.890
Everybody knows this country ain't stupid

77
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.020
enough to elect another Republican.

78
00:03:55.063 --> 00:03:59.806
After that Gerald Ford bullshit.

79
00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:02.523
(ominous music)

80
00:04:04.371 --> 00:04:07.204
(heavy breathing)

81
00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:26.237
♪ You got no more money honey ♪

82
00:04:26.287 --> 00:04:28.830
♪ Then I got no more time ♪

83
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.924
- You shouldn't be here
my little orangutan.


84
00:04:30.974 --> 00:04:31.757
People might say you're too old

85
00:04:31.807 --> 00:04:33.751
to see your mommy like this.

86
00:04:33.801 --> 00:04:35.134
Well, maybe not.

87
00:04:35.997 --> 00:04:37.247
Are you hungry?

88
00:04:38.807 --> 00:04:40.603
What are you doing?

89
00:04:40.653 --> 00:04:44.330
(screaming)
(suspenseful music)


90
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.963
(loud popping)

91
00:04:52.147 --> 00:04:55.064
(melancholy music)

92
00:05:19.226 --> 00:05:22.893
(speaking foreign language)

93
00:05:34.372 --> 00:05:37.039
(ominous music)

94
00:05:56.741 --> 00:05:59.324
(loud buzzing)

95
00:06:02.516 --> 00:06:06.758
- Christ, why does it have
to happen on my watch?


96
00:06:06.808 --> 00:06:07.680
- You got to save us.

97
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:08.640
- On my salary?

98
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:09.917
You on your own man!

99
00:06:11.676 --> 00:06:13.820
- Why would God let him escape?

100
00:06:16.533 --> 00:06:17.366
Why!

101
00:06:18.693 --> 00:06:23.693
Why God, why!
(suspenseful music)


102
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.163
- Dr. Clinton.

103
00:06:36.364 --> 00:06:39.031
(loud growling)

104
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.720
Gosh that's a really bad cough.

105
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.780
This is Yen, I'm at
the southeast stairwell


106
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.612
and Dr. Clinton was stabbed in the back

107
00:06:47.662 --> 00:06:49.792
and she fell down the stairs.

108
00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:51.331
- [Narrator] Fell down the stairs?

109
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:52.164
What, again?

110
00:06:52.214 --> 00:06:54.700
- Just get a medic here asap!

111
00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.130
- David has escaped and
you have to stop him.


112
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.460
The world is not ready for
this creature's hatred,


113
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.190
hypocrisy, insolence, lies,

114
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.753
prejudice, and vanity.

115
00:07:08.755 --> 00:07:11.504
Not to mention that hair.

116
00:07:11.554 --> 00:07:14.008
You have to stop him.

117
00:07:14.058 --> 00:07:15.475
- Clinton let go.

118
00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:23.058
(loud growling)

119
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.343
- Oh shit!

120
00:07:26.224 --> 00:07:30.575
Dr. Combes!

121
00:07:30.625 --> 00:07:31.920
And Dr. McCabe!

122
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.863
All units.

123
00:07:37.913 --> 00:07:39.750
I think I spotted him.

124
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.680
He's heading over to the west gate.

125
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.883
Someone, anyone, stop him.

126
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.693
Just not me.

127
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.903
Don't let him

128
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:49.603
get out.

129
00:07:52.892 --> 00:07:55.809
(melancholy music)

130
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.190
(ominous music)

131
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.890
- Four of our best
doctors murdered by that


132
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.140
deranged lunatic, Dr. Lutin, four.

133
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.420
And you know where David is
going but won't disclose it?


134
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.730
- Where he might be going.

135
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.240
- You have no right to
withhold that information.


136
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.310
- As a medic I have every
right to withhold information.


137
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.320
And you have allowed your personal

138
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:18.760
feelings to skew your judgment Dr. Schiff.

139
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.840
- What exactly is it
between you and David huh?


140
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.360
He hated everyone on the staff except you.

141
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.620
What kind of hold
do you have over him?

142
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.070
- You're insinuating that
there was some form of


143
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.530
collusion between David and me?

144
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.660
Then produce the evidence.

145
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:35.920
- Oh we are.

146
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.130
An internal investigation
has already begun.


147
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.310
- Based on hysteria.

148
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.540
You all need to take your pills.

149
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.660
- We're also looking into your sudden

150
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:42.870
rise of power here at the hospital.

151
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.070
- I don't know what you mean.

152
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.140
- Meaning that there's
something very sinister


153
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.350
in the nature of your stranglehold here.

154
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.950
- Like envy, or resentment, or both?

155
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.820
- We have a witness Dr. Lutin.

156
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.740
- Would that be Dr. Sergei?

157
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.330
- Why yes it would.

158
00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:00.860
- Sergei met with an unfortunate
accident late last night.


159
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.870
He will not be your witness.

160
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.610
- What are you saying?

161
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.260
- He expired.

162
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:07.840
- You had something to do
with his death didn't you?


163
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.460
- Another accusation based
on no tangible evidence.


164
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.593
I'll be in touch.

165
00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:43.556
(slow paced music)

166
00:09:45.775 --> 00:09:49.098
(speaking foreign language)

167
00:09:49.148 --> 00:09:52.815
(speaking foreign language)

168
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.773
- What a beautiful day.

169
00:09:59.225 --> 00:10:01.558
(whistling)

170
00:10:17.497 --> 00:10:18.967
- [Little Boy] Lana!

171
00:10:19.017 --> 00:10:20.515
- Good morning Pepe.

172
00:10:20.565 --> 00:10:22.390
- Good morning.

173
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.810
- I'm so sorry
to hear about your parents.

174
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.020
Any word yet?

175
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.830
- Not since the
ICE agents took them away.

176
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.810
Blanca has been calling
every day to find them.


177
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.450
- I hope they're okay.

178
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.990
- Me too.

179
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:35.823
Lana.

180
00:10:35.873 --> 00:10:36.750
- Yes.

181
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.563
- Why is this happening?

182
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.300
- The people who run our country

183
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.330
are filled with hatred,
prejudice, and fear.


184
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.370
They think we're different
so they persecute us.


185
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.670
- Even if we haven't done anything wrong?

186
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.750
Like mi mama and papa?

187
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.650
- That's right.

188
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.750
We live in a dangerous world Pepe.

189
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.530
We have to learn how to cope.

190
00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.930
The Republican party...

191
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.520
- Don't say that word.

192
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.050
It scares me.

193
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:04.883
- Republican?

194
00:11:04.933 --> 00:11:05.716
- Yes.

195
00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:08.120
They're the ones who took my parents away.

196
00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.130
And now Blanca said they
could take her away too


197
00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.190
because she's a DACA recipient.

198
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.633
I'll be all alone.

199
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.350
- Your sister won't leave you.

200
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.880
We're gonna fight this all the way.

201
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.290
I promise you.

202
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.123
- Okay.

203
00:11:20.173 --> 00:11:21.690
- You know, a great American president

204
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.237
once said, "With malice toward none and

205
00:11:24.287 --> 00:11:25.400
"with charity for all."

206
00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:26.430
- Abraham Lincoln.

207
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.850
- Yes, that's right.

208
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.380
But in today's world, those amazing words

209
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.780
only apply to the wealthy, the privileged,

210
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.623
the intolerant, and the ignorant.

211
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.360
Muslim, Mexican, Haitian,

212
00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.863
gay, black, transgender,

213
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.730
they don't want us to be a
part of their elitist society.


214
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:45.940
If it was up to them,

215
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.940
they would throw us all away.

216
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:49.522
You know what that makes them?

217
00:11:49.572 --> 00:11:50.355
- What?

218
00:11:50.405 --> 00:11:51.820
- Fucking assholes.

219
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.660
- You said a bad word!

220
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.410
- Do you know what's even scarier?

221
00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.270
The people in this country who believe

222
00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.920
the same things.

223
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.320
Who follow and support
the hatred and bigotry.


224
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.730
They're even worse.

225
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.780
- Like those mean
men I see on TV?

226
00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:07.613
- Yes.

227
00:12:07.663 --> 00:12:09.683
Like Sean Carlson and Tucker Hannity.

228
00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.890
All these horrible people
I would categorize as--


229
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.030
- Stupid fucking assholes?

230
00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.280
- Now you're getting it.

231
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.620
Also, just remember this when
you're feeling very scared.


232
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.960
You have a powerful shield against them.

233
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.580
It protects you.

234
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:27.820
Do you know what it is?

235
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.067
- What?

236
00:12:29.117 --> 00:12:30.997
- You're an American citizen.

237
00:12:31.047 --> 00:12:32.250
- I am?

238
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.723
- You were born here weren't you?

239
00:12:33.773 --> 00:12:35.080
- Yeah.

240
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.510
- That gives you
a whole lot of ammunition

241
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.150
to fight against them.

242
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.040
Don't ever let anybody tell you you can't

243
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:41.690
change the world Pepe.

244
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.960
Heck, one day you might even be the

245
00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.190
President of the United States.

246
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.690
I'll vote for you.

247
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.263
Now, let's go before you're
late for school, okay?


248
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:53.090
Oh, I have to drop off the keys

249
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.020
at the McDaniels first real quick.

250
00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.250
- The McDaniels house.

251
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.710
You can't go there, it's possessed!

252
00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.630
They say it's the gateway to hell.

253
00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.480
The son of the devil was born there.

254
00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.130
- Just an urban legend.

255
00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.789
Stay right here, I'll be back.

256
00:13:06.839 --> 00:13:08.006
- [Pepe] Okay.

257
00:13:22.803 --> 00:13:25.470
(ominous music)

258
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:27.413
- Hello?

259
00:13:36.225 --> 00:13:39.892
(speaking foreign language)

260
00:14:01.444 --> 00:14:03.861
(ominous music)

261
00:14:03.911 --> 00:14:05.250
(clanking)

262
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.470
Who's there?

263
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.433
Hello?

264
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.273
Hello?

265
00:14:13.099 --> 00:14:16.130
(upbeat ringtone)

266
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.780
Blanca, don't do that.

267
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:18.613
- [Blanca] Do what?

268
00:14:18.663 --> 00:14:19.805
It's a phone, you get calls.

269
00:14:19.855 --> 00:14:21.270
Where are you?

270
00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.624
- At the McDaniels house.

271
00:14:22.674 --> 00:14:23.790
- [Blanca] Aye, get out of there girl,

272
00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.623
that place is possessed.

273
00:14:24.673 --> 00:14:27.390
- Soy here, the padlock
on the door was broken


274
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.870
and the door was open.

275
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.270
My dad's seen homeless
people sleeping in here.


276
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:33.324
I hear a noise.

277
00:14:33.374 --> 00:14:34.697
- [Blanca] (speaking foreign
language) you're still there.


278
00:14:34.747 --> 00:14:36.850
Jesus, you're like one of those
(speaking foreign language)


279
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:37.820
in the movies who don't run away

280
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:38.990
when they see the killer coming.

281
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.814
- I gotta go,
see you in a few.

282
00:14:40.864 --> 00:14:43.531
(ominous music)

283
00:14:59.582 --> 00:15:02.582
(suspenseful music)

284
00:15:18.642 --> 00:15:19.425
(clanking)

285
00:15:19.475 --> 00:15:20.308
Shit.

286
00:15:25.847 --> 00:15:28.847
(suspenseful music)

287
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.580
See, nothing to be scared of.

288
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:49.790
Hey, why don't you come
tonight with your sister?


289
00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.480
We're making the banners and watching

290
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:52.869
the State of the Union Address.

291
00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:53.702
We could use your help.

292
00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:54.535
- Really?

293
00:15:54.585 --> 00:15:55.368
- Sure, come with your sister.

294
00:15:55.418 --> 00:15:57.710
- Isn't the State of the
Union speech in January?


295
00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.850
- [Lana] Not anymore, the
mob boss of the United States


296
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.240
moved it up so
he can vacation in Crimea.

297
00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:03.230
- [Pepe] Well, 
I'll see you tonight.

298
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.113
- [Lana] Bye.

299
00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:09.198
(sings in foreign language)

300
00:16:14.636 --> 00:16:15.419
(ominous music)

301
00:16:15.469 --> 00:16:16.500
- There was a big Republican rally today

302
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:17.937
in the town of (speaks
in foreign language).


303
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:23.060
A man matching the description
knocked out a driver,


304
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.970
took his clothes, and stole his vehicle.

305
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.280
So it's only a matter of time now.

306
00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:28.750
- Time for what Dr. Schiff?

307
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.840
- Murder Dr. Lutin.

308
00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.140
The man is evil.

309
00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.430
- Alright.

310
00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.670
David's heading for Sinclair.

311
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.140
He spent some times there
at Big Brothers Summer Camp.


312
00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:38.290
Often spoke of returning there one day.

313
00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.820
They have a hilarious puppet show.

314
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:40.940
- You're not bullshitting me?

315
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:42.930
- [Lutin] I've always been
a man of my word Dr. Schiff.


316
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.210
- Yeah okay sure.

317
00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.553
The only one stupid enough
to believe that is David.


318
00:16:45.603 --> 00:16:47.300
- [Lutin] Think what you may,

319
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.813
but David is not my bride
and I'm not his groom.


320
00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.250
- Alright, I'll let the authorities know

321
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.750
to meet David in Sinclair.

322
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.900
You stay by the phone.

323
00:17:07.637 --> 00:17:10.387
(birds chirping)

324
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.973
- Hello, is there anyone here?

325
00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.350
I am locking the door from the outside

326
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.473
so you will not
be able to get out!

327
00:17:42.658 --> 00:17:44.310
(clanking)

328
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.930
Whoever you are, come on out.

329
00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.503
You do not need
to be afraid my friend.

330
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:55.490
If you are in trouble,

331
00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.020
I will help you.

332
00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.560
If you are hungry,

333
00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.030
I will feed you.

334
00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:07.290
This is the credo of my people

335
00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.110
and well-being of our fellow--

336
00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.883
(dramatic music)

337
00:18:11.933 --> 00:18:14.100
(moaning)

338
00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.710
- Hitler used the
idea of the Big Lie

339
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.050
to mind control the people.

340
00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:37.140
Just tell them and they'll believe it.

341
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:38.190
That's it.

342
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.073
They just do.

343
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.540
He used the use of trigger words

344
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.040
to manipulate the people.

345
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:47.270
Such as loser, winning,

346
00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.163
believe me, low-life, and covfefe.

347
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.190
Hitler was just one man,
yet he rose to power.


348
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.820
How Ms. Shaheed?

349
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.020
- It was made possible by
his millions of supporters


350
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.350
who wanted to believe his lies

351
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.490
and did his dirty work for him.

352
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.460
- [Teacher] Yes!

353
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.780
- Mr. Doocy.

354
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.340
(loud screeching)

355
00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:08.653
- It's Doocy!

356
00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.340
- Doocy.

357
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:14.780
Isn't it true that your great grandfather,

358
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.960
Victor Von Doocy, hosted a radio show

359
00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:19.960
called the Fuhrer and Friends

360
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.720
that subversively turned over
half of American Citizens


361
00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.100
into Nazi sympathizers?

362
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.520
- Yes that is an unfortunate

363
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.600
part of my scandalous heritage

364
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:34.010
which I do not wish to discuss!

365
00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.850
Is that clear Mr. Scarborough?

366
00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:38.880
- Well isn't it true--

367
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:40.000
- Remember boys and girls,

368
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:42.060
after class we are
meeting in the courtyard


369
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.280
to witness today's solar eclipse.

370
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.363
Each of you will receive
a pair of these glasses.


371
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:52.470
But do not stare directly
into the eclipse!


372
00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.230
As it will cause irreparable
harm to your retinas.


373
00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.340
But you all know this because you're not

374
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.261
brainless idiots!

375
00:19:59.311 --> 00:20:01.561
(laughing)

376
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.990
Our esteemed math teacher and rugby coach,

377
00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.000
Mrs. L. Ying Conway will escort you

378
00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:13.223
after we are adjourned.

379
00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.470
Now back to Hitler.

380
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.460
Hitler's lies and rhetoric destroyed and

381
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.720
deceived millions of lives.
(engine revving)


382
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.230
And any radio programs, or newspapers

383
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.070
who called out his lies

384
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.370
were deemed fake news.

385
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.300
And any officials who opposed him

386
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.753
were arrested and taken
before a firing squad.


387

I am not.

405
00:21:03.676 --> 00:21:05.918
I'm gonna be President

413
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.518
A voluptuous porn star with
giant triple D titties.


414
00:22:14.568 --> 00:22:17.000
And might I say an underrated actress.

415
00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.650
I owned all of her VHS tapes.

416
00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.740
I did not have sex
relations with that woman.


417
00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:23.623
I wanted to.

418
00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:25.940
She helped get me through the Bush years.

419
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:28.110
- It pains me to hear you speak.

420
00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.353
- I have great fondness for
three of her cinematic opuses.

- You know the man who did this?

445
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.190
- I do.

446
00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.293
He's my patient.

447
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.553
- He spelled digging wrong.

448
00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:53.127
He opened money digging
whore with quotation marks


449
00:23:53.177 --> 00:23:55.383
and then finished it with an apostrophe.

450
00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:57.453
- Yes.

451
00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:00.083
- Whore is misspelled.

452
00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.500
It should be, she
lies here not she lays.

453
00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:06.880
- Yes.

454
00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:10.263
- This is grammatical and
syntactic cluster fuck.


455
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.110
What is he, some kind of retard?

456
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:18.980
- I think we're done here.

457
00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:19.813
- Can you believe it?

458
00:24:19.863 --> 00:24:21.860
He commits a felony and is still

459
00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:23.670
elected teacher of the year.

460
00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.970
- Incredible.

461
00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:25.803
What do you think is worse?

462
00:24:25.853 --> 00:24:26.636
School or hell?

463
00:24:26.686 --> 00:24:27.610
- School in hell.

464
00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.017
- Boo.

466

- You girls think this is hell?

467
00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:36.650
You have no idea what hell is like.

468
00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.600
- I bet you do Father Guiliani.

469
00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.753
- Indeed I do, indeed I do.

470
00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.460
Have you girls found Jesus?

471
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:45.320
- I wasn't really looking.
(angelic singing)


472
00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:46.720
- Maybe he's down my shirt.

473
00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:50.523
- He is right here girls.

474
00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.893
But, you have to want his love.

475
00:24:57.434 --> 00:24:58.484
You have to reach out

476
00:24:59.659 --> 00:25:01.903
and grab his love.

477
00:25:05.117 --> 00:25:07.403
Are you feeling his
love grow in your hands?


478
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.730
You wanna get down on your knees

479
00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.630
and feel his love all over your face?

480
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:14.980
- I don't think
Jesus would be into me.

481
00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:15.863
I'm Muslim.

482
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.977
- Move along girls, baby
Jesus hates dwellers.


483
00:25:20.027 --> 00:25:21.500
- Fucking freak.

484
00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:22.820
- [Blanca] He's such a perv.

485
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:23.680
Can you believe he got away with molesting

486
00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:24.660
those underage boys?

487
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:25.493
- [Lana] Yeah, all underage.

488
00:25:25.543 --> 00:25:26.586
- All of them.

489
00:25:26.636 --> 00:25:27.419
- They were of age.

490
00:25:27.469 --> 00:25:28.252
- Who?

491
00:25:28.302 --> 00:25:29.660
- No one.

492
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:31.920
Girls, life begins--

493
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.590
- I know, I know, conception.

494
00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.473
- No.

495
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:36.483
Erection.

496
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:38.923
Girls, I'm a man of the cloth.

497
00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.810
I can get away with rape, murder,

498
00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:45.420
incest, pedophilia, and even
bestiality if I felt like it.


499
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.220
Without any consequences.

500
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:48.053
I answer to God.

501
00:25:48.103 --> 00:25:53.103
He is my judge, jury, and
executioner in the end.


502
00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.726
- Let's go.

503
00:25:54.776 --> 00:25:56.580
- Why not have a little
fun in the meantime?


504
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:58.330
- Shall we schedule your meeting with God

505
00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.950
say, right now!

506
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.800
- You think you're gonna get away

507
00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:02.270
with all this shit you piece of fuck!

508
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.353
We're here to make sure you don't!

509
00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.732
(loud thud)
(screaming)


510
00:26:07.782 --> 00:26:12.782
Fucking asshole.
(angelic singing)


511
00:26:20.351 --> 00:26:22.747
(ominous music)

512
00:26:22.797 --> 00:26:24.611
I have 42 people confirmed.

513
00:26:24.661 --> 00:26:25.456
You?

514
00:26:25.506 --> 00:26:27.533
82 so far.

515
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.380
- Great!

516
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:30.880
Glad you're getting so
many families involved.


517
00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:34.122
- That's just the Rodriguez
and Martinez families.


518
00:26:34.172 --> 00:26:36.040
- What, 82 people?

519
00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:39.030
- What, I can't help it
if passions in our blood.


520
00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.963
Oh and the daily tequila shots.

521
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:43.632
- Anyway, strength in numbers right?

522
00:26:43.682 --> 00:26:44.920
- Hey.

523
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.070
I heard the news coverage is
gonna be through the roof.


524
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.410
I want the whole country,
the world to know


525
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.590
that my parents were taken away.

526
00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.080
- Oh by the
way Medjine, we're coming over

527
00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:55.180
to your place tonight to watch

528
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:56.955
the State of the Union Address.

529
00:26:57.005 --> 00:26:59.120
- Oh great, my nights to be ruined.

530
00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:00.320
Why my place?

531
00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:01.730
- Because your parents are out of town

532
00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.535
and your place is stuffed with booze.

533
00:27:03.585 --> 00:27:05.826
(laughing)

534
00:27:05.876 --> 00:27:07.151
- [Lana] And Gabriel is gonna be there.

535
00:27:07.201 --> 00:27:07.984
(eerie music)

536
00:27:08.034 --> 00:27:09.348
- I feel so bad for him.

537
00:27:09.398 --> 00:27:13.660
First purple heart, bronze
star, silver star, and now this.


538
00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:22.840
Is that one of those ISIS agents?

539
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:23.770
- [Blanca] ICE agents.

540
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.130
- [Medjine] Same difference.

541
00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.610
- I don't think so.

542
00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.810
That weirdo was looking at me through

543
00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:28.913
the window at school.

544
00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.460
- Republican creep, why don't you take

545
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:32.486
that stick shift out your--

546
00:27:32.536 --> 00:27:33.319
- Hey, cut it out Blanca,

547
00:27:33.369 --> 00:27:34.983
you're gonna get us all deported!

548
00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.520
- [Blanca] I hate a Republican
without a sense of humor.


549
00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.143
- [Lana] Is there any other kind?

550
00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:47.120
- Okay, so I'm gonna
make Pepe some dinner,


551
00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:48.120
then I'm gonna get my stuff together

552
00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.490
and I'll pick you up in 45?

553
00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:50.772
- Yeah, sounds good.

554
00:27:50.822 --> 00:27:54.322
(speaks foreign language)

555
00:27:56.028 --> 00:27:59.028
(suspenseful music)

556
00:28:00.881 --> 00:28:01.714
- Hey you!

557
00:28:29.192 --> 00:28:30.530
(dramatic music)

558
00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:32.060
- I didn't mean to scare you Lana.

559
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:32.900
- It's okay.

560
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:34.680
This scary guy's been following me.

561
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:37.450
He's wearing a suit and
creepy presidents mask.


562
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.633
He was right there.

563
00:28:42.353 --> 00:28:43.863
- I don't see anybody.

564
00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.380
It's just your mind playing tricks on you.

565
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:48.510
Hey, we've all got the jitters

566
00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.630
with those mid-terms
right around the corner.


567
00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.270
- Yeah, that must be it.

568
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.100
- You still participating
in that rally tomorrow?


569
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:55.820
- Yes of course, yeah.

570
00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:58.100
- I believe in your cause Lana.

571
00:28:58.150 --> 00:28:59.800
- I appreciate that Sheriff Mueller.

572
00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:00.633
Thank you.

573
00:29:00.683 --> 00:29:02.336
- You enjoy the
rest of your day okay?

574
00:29:02.386 --> 00:29:03.219
- You too.

575
00:29:10.972 --> 00:29:13.639
(ominous music)

576
00:29:19.683 --> 00:29:23.516
(singing in foreign language)

577
00:29:27.443 --> 00:29:30.110
(door creaking)

578
00:29:39.994 --> 00:29:41.450
- David.

579
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.243
David it's Dr. Lutin.

580
00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:45.903
You can come out.

581
00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.770
Have no fear little one.

582
00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.636
I am here to protect thee.

583
00:30:01.686 --> 00:30:04.353
(ominous music)

584
00:30:14.358 --> 00:30:17.691
(slow triumphant music)

585
00:30:50.427 --> 00:30:54.094
(music in foreign language)

586
00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:00.650
- So, I have to make
one stop along the way.


587
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.270
- Oh, where?

588
00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.520
- My church.

589
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:05.250
I have to get my fiesta box.

590
00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.320
- What's that?

591
00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:08.330
- Oh, you didn't hear?

592
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.660
Food stamps have been discontinued

593
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.880
so now the impoverished get
a fiesta box once a week.


594
00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:13.990
- You're kidding me.

595
00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:14.860
- Nope.

596
00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:16.920
You can thank the Christian Conservatives

597
00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:18.720
for that brilliant idea.

598
00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:19.733
- That's crazy.

599
00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.210
Can we change the station?

600
00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.670
- Yeah, go ahead if you want to.

601
00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.059
I like that song, but whatever.

602
00:31:27.109 --> 00:31:28.146
- Thank you.

603
00:31:28.196 --> 00:31:30.680
- [Narrator] Native American, young, old,

604
00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:34.070
gay, straight, men, women,

605
00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.240
folks with disabilities,
all pledging allegiance


606
00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:39.300
under the same proud flag to this

607
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:42.080
big bold country that we love.

608
00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:43.200
That's what I see.

609
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:45.720
- (speaks foreign language)
I miss you so much.


610
00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:46.553
Come back.

611
00:31:46.603 --> 00:31:49.260
- [Narrator] Kids who have a
different sexual orientation


612
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:53.070
or are transgender are
subject to a lot of bullying.


613
00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.460
Children should be allowed to use

614
00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:56.043
the bathroom of their choice.

615
00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.990
- We miss you Obama.

616
00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.130
- [Narrator] In response, the
president had this to say.


617
00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.520
- [Narrator] You know what
happened to the Greeks?


618
00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:06.980
Homosexuality destroyed them.

619
00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.690
Aristotle was a fag.

620
00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:09.573
So was Socrates.

621
00:32:10.482 --> 00:32:11.435
(Blanca growling)

622
00:32:11.485 --> 00:32:12.590
(speaking in foreign language)

623
00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.332
- I can't stand the sound of
(speaks in foreign language)


624
00:32:14.382 --> 00:32:15.566
voice, he's such a pig fucker!

625
00:32:15.616 --> 00:32:16.399
He's not even a man!

626
00:32:16.449 --> 00:32:18.450
He should just crawl
up his own ass and die!


627
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.283
Jesus!

628
00:32:19.333 --> 00:32:22.310
- [Narrator] But once priests
started stuffing each others'


629
00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.680
tacos, that was the end.

630
00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:26.442
Homosexuality has always
(eerie music)


631
00:32:26.492 --> 00:32:30.270
signaled the downfall
of a once great society.


632
00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.821
Which won't happen under
my watch, believe me.


633
00:32:32.871 --> 00:32:34.620
Believe me, trust me okay.

634
00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:37.800
But anyway, Kanye thank you

635
00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:42.850
for speaking the truth
about me and black people.


636
00:32:42.904 --> 00:32:45.540
- [Blanca] Ooh, if I could
just punch his face just once!


637
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:46.650
Just once!

638
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.419
Punch him, I'd knock his ass out,

639
00:32:48.469 --> 00:32:50.872
I swear to God!

640
00:32:50.922 --> 00:32:53.589
(bells ringing)

641
00:33:10.436 --> 00:33:13.269

(dramatic music)
(screaming)


643
00:33:22.887 --> 00:33:26.590
- Oh Blanca, you scared
the shit out of me!


644
00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.780
- It's just a stupid presidents mask.

645
00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:30.380
They're handing them out like candy.

646
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:31.330
You want it?

647
00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.103
- No, not on my dead body.

648
00:33:39.621 --> 00:33:40.454
- Okay.

649
00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.780
- Is that the fiesta box?

650
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:48.583
- Mm hmm, check this out.

651
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:53.153
We have about six of these.

652
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:56.560
Oh and that's just the main course.

653
00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:58.400
We also have some nutritious veggies.

654
00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:01.090
- Oh my God, this doesn't
even qualify as prison food.


655
00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:04.940
- And a bottle of milk
that expired last month.


656
00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:06.120
- Wow.

657
00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:07.990
- Oh, and let's not forget.

658
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.540
Desert!

659
00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:13.090
- Okay, we're going to the
grocery store right now


660
00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.720
and I'm gonna stock you
and Pepe up with food.


661
00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:16.700
'Cause this is just fucking stupid.

662
00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:17.690
- For real?

663
00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:19.890
- Of course, I'll put
it on my credit card.


664
00:34:21.074 --> 00:34:22.574
- You're the best.

665
00:34:24.298 --> 00:34:26.210
Okay, I take back all the bad things

666
00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:27.704
I ever said about Muslims.

667
00:34:27.754 --> 00:34:30.004
(laughing)

668
00:34:31.114 --> 00:34:33.590
(ominous music)

669
00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:36.890
- I command the forces of darkness

670
00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:41.390
to bestow their infernal powers upon us.

671
00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.240
God of the earth, 
Lord of the world,

672
00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.460
open thy the gates of hell

673
00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:51.833
so that your son, the devil incarnate,

674
00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.110
Prince of Darkness,

675
00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.020
may deliver unto your temple

676
00:34:57.877 --> 00:35:01.730
the unholy, the unclean,

677
00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.060
the deviant, the repellent spirits

678
00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:07.220
that are God's mistakes that violate

679
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.043
this righteous world.

680
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:13.010
Bestow this elixir,

681
00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:16.520
plus the essence of your supreme power,

682
00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:19.290
so that your exultant spawns reign

683
00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.933
shall burn eternal.

684
00:35:22.424 --> 00:35:26.628
(singing in foreign language)

685
00:35:26.678 --> 00:35:27.511
David,

686
00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.593
you've been doing great work.

687
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:38.050
But you have to yet reach
your full potential.


688
00:35:40.381 --> 00:35:42.639
(eerie music)

689
00:35:42.689 --> 00:35:43.953
Where there was light,

690
00:35:44.003 --> 00:35:47.894
there will now be darkness.
(loud sipping)


691
00:35:47.944 --> 00:35:48.994
Where there was calm,

692
00:35:50.198 --> 00:35:52.198
there will now be chaos.

693
00:35:53.673 --> 00:35:55.673
And when there was love,

694
00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:58.893
there will now be hatred.

695
00:35:59.886 --> 00:36:03.719
(singing in foreign language)

696
00:36:11.547 --> 00:36:14.676
David, you have been unleashed.

697
00:36:14.726 --> 00:36:19.726
Let the purge begin.

698
00:36:20.522 --> 00:36:25.522
(dramatic music)
(laughing)


699
00:36:38.798 --> 00:36:40.215
- [Medjine] Guys!

700
00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:44.338
- I love it!
(laughing)


701
00:36:44.388 --> 00:36:45.570
- [Lana] Awesome.

702
00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.170
- What do you think about mine?

703
00:36:53.167 --> 00:36:55.850
- It's so good, I hope
he tweets about that.


704
00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.150
(laughing)

705
00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:05.930
- You have got to be the
happiest person I know.


706
00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:08.660
- Well, my mama always said that

707
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:10.160
ever since I came out of the womb

708
00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:11.080
I was smiling.

709
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:14.040
Not even after the doctor
slapped me, I didn't cry.


710
00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:15.420
I did not.

711
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:17.970
And I haven't stopped smiling ever since.

712
00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:21.120
You know, I just feel like
amid all the bad times


713
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:25.770
I had to find something
to, you know, celebrate


714
00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:26.603
and laugh about.

715
00:37:26.653 --> 00:37:28.360
Even if it's that piece of shit

716
00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:29.960
President of the United States.

717
00:37:31.733 --> 00:37:33.650
You know, I came into
this world with a smile,


718
00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.403
and I plan to
go out the same way.

719
00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:45.460
- Well would you lookie lookie here.

720
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:50.180
A Haitian, a Muslim,
and a God damn Mexican!


721
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:53.440
Making America less God damn American.

722
00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:55.220
- Oh Porter and Sorenson,

723
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:58.323
two dumb ass rednecks
making America, puke.


724
00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:01.380
- What are you guys doing here?

725
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:03.263
- We're just here to watch the tryouts.

726
00:38:04.788 --> 00:38:06.220
- Sorry Porter.

727
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.053
- You guys aren't trying out are you?

728
00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.400
That's a God damn relief.

729
00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:16.900
You see, seeing dark meat
in little skimpy outfit,


730
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:18.177
is just (imitates vomiting).

731
00:38:25.393 --> 00:38:27.810
I see you're prepping another

732
00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.000
hate-filled joke of a libetard rally aye?

733
00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:32.771
- Yes, and you Republicunts
are the punchline.


734
00:38:32.821 --> 00:38:34.767
(laughing)

735
00:38:34.817 --> 00:38:35.890
- We're fighting for democracy.

736
00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:38.210
- Oh, don't you spooks realize?

737
00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.540
Every time you pull one of these stunts,

738
00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:43.680
makes us real Americans want you

739
00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:45.478
out of our country even more?

740
00:38:45.528 --> 00:38:46.311
Hmm?

741
00:38:46.361 --> 00:38:47.144
You ever think about that?

742
00:38:47.194 --> 00:38:48.640
- Ever heard of the constitution?

743
00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:50.050
- Constitution?

744
00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:50.933
Constitution?

745
00:38:51.767 --> 00:38:52.946
I don't know.

746
00:38:52.996 --> 00:38:53.980
- Do you even know what's in it?

747
00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:55.820
- I know my people wrote it.

748
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:56.960
We the people.

749
00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:00.225
- Okay then, what does
the 15th amendment say?


750
00:39:00.275 --> 00:39:01.108
- Uh, 15?

751
00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:04.791
- Medjine.

752
00:39:04.841 --> 00:39:07.070
- The right to vote for all citizens.

753
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.670
- How about the 14th amendment?

754
00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:11.770
- Blanca?

755
00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.300
- All persons born in the
United States are citizens.


756
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:15.690
With equal protection under the law

757
00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.898
you stupid motherfuckers!

758
00:39:17.948 --> 00:39:20.200
(speaks foreign language)

759
00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:22.320
- Look Pocahontas, I hate
to spoil your pinata here,


760
00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:24.380
but just 'cause you can
quote the constitution


761
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.160
doesn't make you a true American.

762
00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:27.340
- How about my brother?

763
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:29.170
He's a Lance Corporal
in Afghanistan fighting


764
00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.490
for your rights to be an assholes.

765
00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.910
- Mm hmm, and the only thing
you and him are good for,


766
00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.860
is going out on the front lines
and taking bullets for us.


767
00:39:38.114 --> 00:39:40.958
And mowing our state
lawns, trimming our hedges,


768
00:39:41.008 --> 00:39:44.670
cleaning our pools, and washing my BMW.

769
00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.010
- Wax on, wax off.

770
00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.640
- You know you're a real
piece of shit right?


771
00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:48.473
- Whoa!

772
00:39:48.523 --> 00:39:50.980
Where is all the
tolerance on the left huh?


773
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.113
Look, don't hate us 'cause we're white.

774
00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.880
Just 'cause you got the
shit end of the stick.


775
00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:57.400
And you wanna know why?

776
00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:58.390
- Oh please.

777
00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.063
- God loves white people!

778
00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:03.320
He gave us power, wealth,

779
00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:04.450
superior intelligence,

780
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.430
and might I say God damn good looks.

781
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.780
- You do look good Porter.

782
00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.280
Sorry.

783
00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:11.930
- And that obviously trumps you.

784
00:40:14.302 --> 00:40:16.470
Pissed 'em off now.

785
00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.620
- The only thing that's gonna get trumped

786
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:19.990
is your dumb asses if you
don't leave right now.


787
00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.780
- Ooh, a threat of violence?

788
00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:23.050
Not that I'm surprised.

789
00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.970
Minorities are 10 times more likely

790
00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.270
to commit violent crimes.

791
00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.163
- That's a fact.

792
00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:29.550
- Go ahead spook.

793
00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:31.580
Take the first shot.

794
00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.913
(screaming)

795
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:39.592
- Breathe, breathe, are you okay?

796
00:40:39.642 --> 00:40:42.177
- What the fuck man!

797
00:40:42.227 --> 00:40:46.600
Holy teeth, they knocked
out my front tooth!


798
00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:49.007
(screaming)

799
00:40:49.057 --> 00:40:54.057
(loud punching)
(fast paced music)


800
00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.300
- Alright ladies, our job's done here.

801
00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:11.900
Let's go to your place Medjine.

802
00:41:13.755 --> 00:41:14.588
- Hey.

803
00:41:16.452 --> 00:41:18.702
(groaning)

804
00:41:21.002 --> 00:41:23.919
(slow paced music)

805
00:41:52.541 --> 00:41:57.541
(ominous music)
(heavy breathing)


806
00:42:14.674 --> 00:42:16.841
(beeping)

807
00:42:51.469 --> 00:42:52.302
- Hey!

808
00:42:56.277 --> 00:42:57.694
- [Pepe] Oh yeah!

809
00:43:02.797 --> 00:43:03.983
- [Narrator] I love you too.

810
00:43:04.033 --> 00:43:05.660
I know you love me, I do.

811
00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:06.599
Thank you.

812
00:43:06.649 --> 00:43:08.570
Oh these resistors huh?

813
00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:09.780
They love to resist.

814
00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:11.800
- Do we have to watch this?

815
00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:12.933
He scares me.

816
00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.923
- That is precisely why we must watch.

817
00:43:19.759 --> 00:43:22.610
(laughing)

818
00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:24.820
- Sorry to bother you Sheriff Mueller but

819
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:28.010
my dad never came home today
and my mom's really worried.


820
00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:29.500
It's not like him.

821
00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:31.270
- Lana, where was he last seen?

822
00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.560
- He went to the McDaniel's
house to fix the lock.


823
00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.450
That's the last we heard from him.

824
00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:38.434
- Okay, I'll check it out
and I'll get back to you.


825
00:43:38.484 --> 00:43:40.151
- Thank you so much.

826
00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:42.143
Bye.

827
00:43:44.244 --> 00:43:45.027
- [Narrator] I was like you go boy.

828
00:43:45.077 --> 00:43:46.190
You be yourself okay?

829
00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.670
I called for a total and complete

830
00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.530
shutdown of Muslims,
Mexicans, and Haitians


831
00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:57.810
entering out great nation.

832
00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:59.650
No more illiterate, immoral,

833
00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.940
and unprincipled coming here

834
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:05.090
to contaminate our Christian values.

835
00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:07.310
- Who's illiterate,
immoral, and unprincipled?


836
00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.020
- [Narrator] I say only
bring in quality individuals


837
00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:11.850
from you know, places like Sweden,

838
00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.800
Denmark, Finland.

839
00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:17.047
Respectable blonde-haired, blue-eyed--

840
00:44:17.909 --> 00:44:20.080
(speaks in foreign language)

841
00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:23.780
Let's remove those brown
stains on Americas teeth


842
00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:26.124
and make them pearly white again.

843
00:44:26.174 --> 00:44:28.330
- By those standards, Jesus Christ

844
00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:29.839
wouldn't even get a Visa to come here.

845
00:44:29.889 --> 00:44:32.854
- Yeah.
(cheering)


846
00:44:32.904 --> 00:44:33.973
(doorbell rings)

847
00:44:34.023 --> 00:44:35.773
- Oh, Gabriel's here!

848
00:44:39.155 --> 00:44:41.905
(dramatic music)

849
00:44:43.286 --> 00:44:44.794
- Hey, don't mind her,

850
00:44:44.844 --> 00:44:48.068
she's been seeing ghost
presidents all day.


851
00:44:48.118 --> 00:44:50.415
- So good to see you.

852
00:44:50.465 --> 00:44:52.632
- Hey buddy, how ya doing?

853
00:44:53.648 --> 00:44:55.286
- Gabriel, why the hell are you wearing

854
00:44:55.336 --> 00:44:57.410
this frickin' President suit?

855
00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.200
- My sadistic way of protesting.

856
00:45:01.393 --> 00:45:03.260
- Is this gun real?

857
00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:04.660
- Sure is.

858
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:06.000
Locked and loaded.

859
00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:09.290
In case we get raided for
being just who we are.


860
00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:10.440
- Did you bring
them, did you bring them?

861
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:11.834
- Sure did.

862
00:45:11.884 --> 00:45:13.217
- [Medjine] Yes.

863
00:45:15.198 --> 00:45:16.460
- Here they are.
(everyone gasping)


864
00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:19.293
- My God Gabriel,
we're so proud of you.

865
00:45:20.412 --> 00:45:21.613
- How did you get those?

866
00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.060
- Well, for the purple heart,

867
00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:27.110
I pulled my team leader to safety

868
00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:29.910
when he came under sniper fire.

869
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:33.250
Taking bullets to my shoulder.

870
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:34.173
- Can I see?

871
00:45:35.836 --> 00:45:36.669
- Okay.

872
00:45:41.754 --> 00:45:43.072
- [Blanca] Whoa!

873
00:45:43.122 --> 00:45:45.240
- That really must've hurt.

874
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:47.330
- As for the silver star,

875
00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:49.500
my team came under heavy fire.

876
00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:50.990
Most of my comrades were hit

877
00:45:51.876 --> 00:45:53.220
and wounded.

878
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:55.000
- What did you do?

879
00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:57.070
- I commandeered one
of the enemies vehicles


880
00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.360
and I scooped up
as many of the wounded

881
00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:00.833
soldiers as I could.

882
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:03.120
Got them to safety.

883
00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:04.830
- How many did you save?

884
00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:05.770
- 15.

885
00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:07.160
- Holy shit, that's ballsy.

886
00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:10.590
- It really isn't Blanca.

887
00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.860
It's expected.

888
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:13.400
It's our duty.

889
00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:15.690
It's what every man and woman in uniform

890
00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:17.280
would do for each other

891
00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:19.253
in a similar situation.

892
00:46:19.303 --> 00:46:21.770
- You don't have
to go back do you?

893
00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:22.653
- If asked.

894
00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:26.440
But after receiving my silver star,

895
00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:28.070
I was relieved of duty

896
00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.110
and booted out of the military.

897
00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.780
- But you're a war hero.

898
00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:33.660
- See, our Republican party

899
00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:37.080
decided that transgenders are an intrusion

900
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:38.613
and unfit to serve.

901
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.263
So a ban was put into place.

902
00:46:45.035 --> 00:46:47.800
- What's a transgender?

903
00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:51.060
- Someone who's feelings
about their gender


904
00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:53.863
don't match their bodies.

905
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.580
- Well, it sounds
to me like a transgender

906
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:58.570
is someone who saves many lives.

907
00:46:58.620 --> 00:46:59.503
A hero!

908
00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.880
- Unfortunately Pepe,

909
00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:04.890
there are many people in this world

910
00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:08.860
who act on the fears of
what they don't understand.


911
00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:09.743
Or agree with.

912
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.780
I generally refer to them as--

913
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:14.782
- Fucking assholes!

914
00:47:14.832 --> 00:47:17.854
(laughing)

915
00:47:17.904 --> 00:47:19.760
- Yeah, how'd you know?

916
00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:21.505
- Well, Lana has been teaching me

917
00:47:21.555 --> 00:47:23.950
all about them today.

918
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000
- Yeah Pepe.

919
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:42.697
(ominous music)

920
00:47:59.898 --> 00:48:02.148
(creaking)

921
00:48:18.086 --> 00:48:20.753
(flies buzzing)

922
00:48:27.909 --> 00:48:32.909
(clanking)
(suspenseful music)


923
00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.077
- Freeze, police!

924
00:49:01.624 --> 00:49:03.523
(ominous music)

925
00:49:03.573 --> 00:49:04.813
Who the hell are you?

926
00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:07.570
What's going on here?

927
00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:08.700
- I assure you officer,

928
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:09.693
I am no threat.

929
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:11.583
I'm a doctor.

930
00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.523
- Easy!

931
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:16.150
- My badge.

932
00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.033
- Nice and slow.

933
00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:24.903
- Dr. Lutin of the Lar
-A
-Margo Sanitarium.

934
00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.730
I've been looking for my patient.

935
00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:29.090
- And why the
hell would he come here?

936
00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.875
- He was born here.

937
00:49:30.925 --> 00:49:31.758
In this room.

938
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:34.670
David Barron.

939
00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:35.680
- David Barron?

940
00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:36.860
- You know of him.

941
00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:37.743
- I sure do.

942
00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.400
His mother was a porn star

943
00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:43.070
who birthed a billionaire son

944
00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.453
and then blackmailed the
guy into marrying her.


945
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:52.593
Is that him?

946
00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:55.703
- Yes.

947
00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:00.810
- A man has gone missing.

948
00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:03.803
He was last reported
walking into this house.


949
00:50:05.603 --> 00:50:06.386
Now you wouldn't happen to know

950
00:50:06.436 --> 00:50:07.760
anything about that would you?

951
00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:08.817
- I've been here most of the day

952
00:50:08.867 --> 00:50:10.167
and I haven't seen anyone.

953
00:50:33.576 --> 00:50:36.493
(faint whispering)

954
00:50:38.238 --> 00:50:40.405
- Elixir from Tana Leaves.

955
00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:43.780
Nine to be exact.

956
00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:45.960
- I don't know what that means.

957
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:49.050
- The extract was used in ancient times

958
00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:51.420
during Satanic rituals.

959
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:54.080
A high priest would use the potion

960
00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:56.590
to induce any living mummy or demon--

961
00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.923
- Know something about demons Mr. Mueller?

962
00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:02.920
- In my younger years I
did some work for the RNC.


963
00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:05.870
- All of this is beyond my understanding.

964
00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:10.713
You see, David was
heavily into the occult.


965
00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:14.010
- And you think he's coming back here?

966
00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:15.070
- I think he will.

967
00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:15.953
- Maybe not.

968
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:20.079
Maybe this is exactly what he's expecting.

969
00:51:20.129 --> 00:51:23.129
(suspenseful music)

970
00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:30.290
- This is one fucked up
cabinet that I've ever seen.


971
00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:31.300
- You're right, it is.

972
00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:34.600
- Correction, the second
most fucked up cabinet.


973
00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:36.074
Where are the spices?

974
00:51:36.124 --> 00:51:37.741
- I'm sorry, I'm all out.

975
00:51:37.791 --> 00:51:39.529
- Ah, I have some at my place.

976
00:51:39.579 --> 00:51:41.266
- No, I'll get it, I'll get it.

977
00:51:41.316 --> 00:51:42.407
- No, that's okay.

978
00:51:42.457 --> 00:51:44.143
- Relax war hero.

979
00:51:44.193 --> 00:51:45.026
Keys?

980
00:51:46.976 --> 00:51:49.476
(light music)

981
00:52:02.651 --> 00:52:04.987
- [Gabriel] Okay, pull it tight here.

982
00:52:05.037 --> 00:52:06.100
- Alright.

983
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:07.993
- Now, lean into it.

984
00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:11.413
Check the back blaster here.

985
00:52:13.599 --> 00:52:15.160
- Got it.

986
00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:18.460
- Then pull the trigger arming handle

987
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:19.573
to the on position.

988
00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:22.533
- What's this?

989
00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:25.770
- That's the infrared laser sight.

990
00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:27.370
You don't wanna mess with that.

991
00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:30.060
- You started this.

992
00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:32.593
Show me everything, 
I can handle myself.

993
00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:35.070
- Yeah, I noticed.

994
00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:35.903
- Oh, Aliens!

995
00:52:35.953 --> 00:52:37.333
Fucking aliens!

996
00:52:37.383 --> 00:52:38.166
- You got it.

997
00:52:38.216 --> 00:52:39.460
- It's our turn!

998
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:41.840
- [Narrator] Go after them, it feels good.

999
00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:43.550
And people see you doing it.

1000
00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.450
I always get even.

1001
00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:47.230
- Getting even by having your attorneys

1002
00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:51.092
and deluded supporters do
your dirty work for you?


1003
00:52:51.142 --> 00:52:51.950
Ha, yeah!

1004
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.946
You know what Medjine, you
just have to laugh it off.


1005
00:52:54.996 --> 00:52:55.943
(laughing)

1006
00:52:55.993 --> 00:52:59.080
- [Narrator] My wall, the
one paid for by Mexico,


1007
00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:01.313
will be beautiful.

1008
00:53:01.363 --> 00:53:02.146
- How?

1009
00:53:02.196 --> 00:53:03.861
Oh right, by having it covered with nude

1010
00:53:03.911 --> 00:53:06.734
photos of Eastern European women.

1011
00:53:06.784 --> 00:53:07.750
- [Narrator] And it must be tall.

1012
00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.380
Because Mexican immigrants
are professional


1013
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:11.746
mountain climbers.

1014
00:53:11.796 --> 00:53:12.579
Oh they're good.

1015
00:53:12.629 --> 00:53:16.789
- Gabriel!

1016
00:53:16.839 --> 00:53:20.006
Thanks Gabriel, 
I could use your help.

1017
00:53:24.255 --> 00:53:26.922
(ominous music)

1018
00:53:36.344 --> 00:53:37.177
Oh.

1019
00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:41.753
- [Narrator] I will absolutely apologize

1020
00:53:41.803 --> 00:53:44.040
sometime in the distant future

1021
00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:45.470
if I'm ever wrong.

1022
00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.173
- Oh my God, what an idiot.

1023
00:53:48.313 --> 00:53:50.969
(ominous music)

1024
00:53:51.019 --> 00:53:52.203
- Put down the gun.

1025
00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:55.743
- What's in the box?

1026
00:53:57.875 --> 00:53:59.400
- Just give me the gun David.

1027
00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:01.031
- What's in the box?

1028
00:54:01.081 --> 00:54:02.599
- Give me the gun.

1029
00:54:02.649 --> 00:54:05.074
- What's in the box!

1030
00:54:05.124 --> 00:54:07.992
- [Lana And Gabriel] Seven!

1031
00:54:08.042 --> 00:54:09.865
- [Lana] Got it!

1032
00:54:09.915 --> 00:54:11.461
- [Narrator] Sorry losers.

1033
00:54:11.511 --> 00:54:12.959
- Oh my God, I can't stand him!

1034
00:54:13.009 --> 00:54:15.870
- [Narrator] But my IQ
is one of the highest.


1035
00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.473
And you all know it.

1036
00:54:18.614 --> 00:54:20.950
Please don't feel stupid or insecure.

1037
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.580
- Oh my God, he's such an idiot.

1038
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:24.512
- [Narrator] It's not your fault.

1039
00:54:24.562 --> 00:54:26.757
- I cannot believe he got elected.

1040
00:54:26.807 --> 00:54:28.750
- [Narrator] Are we tired of winning yet?

1041
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.810
- You're hysterical.

1042
00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:32.090
You should do stand up.

1043
00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:33.698
(ominous music)

1044
00:54:33.748 --> 00:54:35.915
(gasping)

1045
00:54:40.209 --> 00:54:45.209
You're killing me.

1046
00:54:48.184 --> 00:54:50.216
- I've been trying to call them.

1047
00:54:50.266 --> 00:54:52.242
I don't know where they are.

1048
00:54:52.292 --> 00:54:54.875
I don't know how they're doing.

1049
00:54:56.013 --> 00:54:58.229
They won't give me any information.

1050
00:54:58.279 --> 00:55:00.279
- Hey, shouldn't Medjine be back by now?

1051
00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:03.480
- Yeah, what's keeping her?

1052
00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:05.303
- I tried calling but no answer.

1053
00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:10.240
I'll go check on her, be right back.

1054
00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:11.767
- [Narrator] Black people love me.

1055
00:55:11.817 --> 00:55:13.894
Yellow people love me.

1056
00:55:13.944 --> 00:55:16.070
Orange people love me.
(ominous music)


1057
00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.886
Blue people love me.

1058
00:55:18.936 --> 00:55:19.769
- Medjine!

1059
00:55:20.891 --> 00:55:24.457
- [Narrator] I'm not
racist because I'm not.


1060
00:55:24.507 --> 00:55:27.650
Let's talk about black
unemployment rates okay.


1061
00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:29.666
- [Gabriel] Medjine?

1062
00:55:29.716 --> 00:55:31.973
- [Narrator] Lowest it's ever been.

1063
00:55:32.023 --> 00:55:32.856
- Medjine.

1064
00:55:34.098 --> 00:55:36.765
(ominous music)

1065
00:55:47.157 --> 00:55:47.990
Medjine?

1066
00:55:55.164 --> 00:55:57.060
(loud thumping)

1067
00:55:57.110 --> 00:55:59.777
(ominous music)

1068
00:56:19.213 --> 00:56:22.130
(triumphant music)

1069
00:56:48.593 --> 00:56:51.260
(ominous music)

1070
00:57:03.689 --> 00:57:05.939
(cracking)

1071
00:57:07.092 --> 00:57:09.759
(loud punching)

1072
00:57:23.345 --> 00:57:25.212
- [Narrator] Remember a
time when boys were boys


1073
00:57:25.262 --> 00:57:27.048
and girls were girls?

1074
00:57:27.098 --> 00:57:28.799
That time has gone.

1075
00:57:28.849 --> 00:57:31.250
Now we've got boy girl combos.

1076
00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:32.290
What do we call them?

1077
00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:34.507
Tranny, he-she, it,

1078
00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:37.400
she-male, transvestite,

1079
00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:40.000
man in a dress, hermaphrodite,

1080
00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:41.850
chick with a dick.

1081
00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:42.733
They're freaks.

1082
00:57:44.171 --> 00:57:46.840
And people who like them
are even sicker okay.


1083
00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:52.190
Transgenders are pure unadulterated evil.

1084
00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:53.073
Okay.

1085
00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:57.763
- Anything?

1086
00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:00.053
- No answer.

1087
00:58:01.195 --> 00:58:02.020
- You think it's a prank?

1088
00:58:02.070 --> 00:58:04.550
- If it is, that bitch is
gonna get a piece of my mind.


1089
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.400
I'm going over there, 
I'll call you.

1090
00:58:24.896 --> 00:58:25.729
Medjine.

1091
00:58:26.657 --> 00:58:28.159
Gabriel.

1092
00:58:28.209 --> 00:58:29.730
- [Narrator] An alarming rate okay.

1093
00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:31.603
It's skyrocketed through the roof.

1094
00:58:31.653 --> 00:58:33.475
- Come on guys, quit playing!

1095
00:58:33.525 --> 00:58:35.340
- [Narrator] No pun intended okay.

1096
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:37.160
What else do you want
from me black people?


1097
00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:39.835
What else do you want from me?

1098
00:58:39.885 --> 00:58:41.072
- Medjine!

1099
00:58:41.122 --> 00:58:45.039
(speaking in foreign language)

1100
00:58:50.706 --> 00:58:51.873
What the fuck?

1101
00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:56.153
Medjine?

1102
00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:01.239
Medjine!

1103
00:59:01.289 --> 00:59:04.024
Gabriel answer me now
or I'm calling the cops!


1104
00:59:04.074 --> 00:59:05.922
- [Narrator] Hilary's day off.

1105
00:59:05.972 --> 00:59:07.008
Oh believe me.

1106
00:59:07.058 --> 00:59:09.407
(dramatic music)

1107
00:59:09.457 --> 00:59:11.220
- Oh, thank God Gabriel.

1108
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:12.403
You scared the shit out of me.

1109
00:59:12.453 --> 00:59:13.786
Where's Medjine?

1110
00:59:17.007 --> 00:59:18.757
Gabriel, is that you?

1111
00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:23.559
(dramatic music)

1112
00:59:38.133 --> 00:59:40.383
(clanking)

1113
00:59:46.815 --> 00:59:49.315
(eerie music)

1114
00:59:54.053 --> 00:59:54.886
Shit.

1115
01:00:18.662 --> 01:00:19.568
Damn it!

1116
01:00:19.618 --> 01:00:21.618
A wall, are you serious!

1117
01:00:51.153 --> 01:00:52.570
Yes Gabriel, yes!

1118
01:00:55.493 --> 01:00:59.160
(speaking foreign language)

1119
01:01:06.099 --> 01:01:08.766
(mexican music)

1120
01:01:15.745 --> 01:01:16.578
Fuck you!

1121
01:01:21.274 --> 01:01:25.107
(singing in foreign language)

1122
01:01:42.169 --> 01:01:43.258
Woo!

1123
01:01:43.308 --> 01:01:44.141
Yes!

1124
01:01:45.376 --> 01:01:48.376
(suspenseful music)

1125
01:01:50.847 --> 01:01:54.273
Some day soon, my people
will remember your people!


1126
01:01:54.323 --> 01:01:56.156
Your time's almost up!

1127
01:01:57.556 --> 01:01:59.806
(groaning)

1128
01:02:10.614 --> 01:02:12.812
- Sheriff Mueller, any
word from my father yet?


1129
01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:14.390
- No Lana, not yet.

1130
01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.760
- I think there's something strange going

1131
01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:17.660
on at the house across the street.

1132
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:18.640
My friends are all there and none

1133
01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:20.739
of them are answering their phones.

1134
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:22.120
- Okay.

1135
01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:23.117
I'll check it out.

1136
01:02:26.330 --> 01:02:28.886
Okay doctor, you're coming with me.

1137
01:02:28.936 --> 01:02:30.273
- Of course.

1138
01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:35.083
- [Narrator] We have great
relationships with China.


1139
01:02:36.181 --> 01:02:39.098
(melancholy music)

1140
01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:10.030
I mean they love me, I love them.

1141
01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.747
Long long time okay?

1142
01:03:13.334 --> 01:03:15.834
Me and the president of China.

1143
01:03:16.727 --> 01:03:19.310
One more time, we're tight now.

1144
01:03:21.412 --> 01:03:23.079
Around a mouse okay.

1145
01:03:24.594 --> 01:03:27.869
We had a long long discussion.

1146
01:03:27.919 --> 01:03:29.213
- Lana.

1147
01:03:29.263 --> 01:03:30.453
I see Gabriel.

1148
01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:38.413
- Where?

1149
01:03:38.463 --> 01:03:40.100
I don't see anything.

1150
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:43.090
- He was right there,
he was carrying Blanca.


1151
01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:44.520
- Carrying Blanca?

1152
01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:45.790
Okay I'm going over there.

1153
01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.196
Lock the door, I'll be back.

1154
01:03:47.246 --> 01:03:48.254
- You can't leave me here by myself!

1155
01:03:48.304 --> 01:03:49.941
- You'll be fine.

1156
01:03:49.991 --> 01:03:50.774
- Please.

1157
01:03:50.824 --> 01:03:53.574
- You'll be fine, you'll be fine.

1158
01:04:00.653 --> 01:04:03.153
(eerie music)

1159
01:04:33.155 --> 01:04:33.988
Medjine?

1160
01:04:35.133 --> 01:04:37.450
- [Narrator] And now
we're gonna get respect.


1161
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.323
- Guys, stop playing.

1162
01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:41.733
Blanca?

1163
01:04:43.877 --> 01:04:44.710
Gabriel?

1164
01:04:49.628 --> 01:04:50.461
Medjine?

1165
01:05:02.308 --> 01:05:04.975
(ominous music)

1166
01:05:06.161 --> 01:05:06.994
Medjine?

1167
01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:12.553
Blanca?

1168
01:05:16.772 --> 01:05:19.439
(door creaking)

1169
01:05:25.928 --> 01:05:28.095
(sobbing)

1170
01:05:58.170 --> 01:06:00.837
(ominous music)

1171
01:06:23.051 --> 01:06:27.412
Yes operator, this is
Lana Shaheed, I need--


1172
01:06:27.462 --> 01:06:28.569
(screaming)

1173
01:06:28.619 --> 01:06:31.536
(fast paced music)

1174
01:06:39.942 --> 01:06:42.859
(triumphant music)

1175
01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:47.501
(growling)

1176
01:06:55.244 --> 01:06:56.077
No!

1177
01:07:02.712 --> 01:07:03.545
No, no!

1178
01:07:10.798 --> 01:07:11.965
- David, stop!

1179
01:07:14.262 --> 01:07:15.845
- David, it's okay.

1180
01:07:17.335 --> 01:07:18.252
Let her go.

1181
01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:24.038
- Sheriff Mueller.

1182
01:07:25.119 --> 01:07:26.293
Sheriff Mueller, he killed my friends.

1183
01:07:26.343 --> 01:07:27.973
They're in the bedroom.

1184
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:32.270
- Doctor, step aside.

1185
01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.720
I'm placing this lunatic
under arrest right now.


1186
01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:39.360
- I suggest you lower your
weapon Sheriff Mueller.


1187
01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:40.283
Or I shoot her.

1188
01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:44.190
- Doctor, put the gun down.

1189
01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.340
- You have no
idea who or what you're

1190
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:47.663
dealing with here do you?

1191
01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:51.150
This is no ordinary man.

1192
01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.603
He is the embodiment of evil.

1193
01:07:54.490 --> 01:07:56.180
The Prince of Darkness

1194
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:58.690
whose reign will soon sweep the globe.

1195
01:07:58.740 --> 01:07:59.980
- It'll be difficult to sweep anything

1196
01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:01.840
from solitary confinement.

1197
01:08:01.890 --> 01:08:03.643
Doctor, put the gun down.

1198
01:08:04.545 --> 01:08:05.712
- As you wish.

1199
01:08:06.952 --> 01:08:09.869
(loud guns firing)

1200
01:08:13.891 --> 01:08:14.808
- You okay?

1201
01:08:15.718 --> 01:08:17.025
It's okay.

1202
01:08:17.075 --> 01:08:20.158
The bullet just grazed your hip okay?

1203
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:26.371
- I failed you David.
(solemn music)


1204
01:08:26.421 --> 01:08:27.254
I'm sorry.

1205
01:08:30.303 --> 01:08:33.723
I will miss our Sunday walks.

1206
01:08:34.977 --> 01:08:36.477
Your warm embrace.

1207
01:09:26.723 --> 01:09:28.223
Goodbye my friend.

1208
01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.650
(ominous music)

1209
01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:44.563
- David.

1210
01:09:46.170 --> 01:09:49.363
You stand your ground
or I will shoot you.

1211
01:09:49.413 --> 01:09:50.324
David.

1212
01:09:50.374 --> 01:09:53.207
(loud gun firing)

1213
01:09:58.641 --> 01:09:59.710
Okay, hang tight.

1214
01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.790
I'm gonna go radio for an ambulance okay?

1215
01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.990
- Please check on Pepe,
he's at Medjine's house


1216
01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:05.499
across the street.

1217
01:10:05.549 --> 01:10:06.382
- Okay.

1218
01:10:18.486 --> 01:10:20.736
(grunting)

1219
01:10:23.579 --> 01:10:24.362
(loud knocking)

1220
01:10:24.412 --> 01:10:25.245
Sheriff, open up!

1221
01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.103
Whoa there Rambo.

1222
01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:32.530
Let's go ahead and hand
that over to me okay?


1223
01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:35.269
- [Narrator] Thank you so much.

1224
01:10:35.319 --> 01:10:37.460
I love you, and again.

1225
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:39.653
- Don't tell me you
know how to use this?

1226
01:10:39.703 --> 01:10:41.000
- It's Gabriel's.

1227
01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:42.900
He taught Lana how to use it tonight.

1228
01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:46.060
Where's my sister?

1229
01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:47.223
Where's Lana?

1230
01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.500
- Let's talk little man, come on.

1231
01:10:56.173 --> 01:10:58.423
(grunting)

1232
01:10:59.508 --> 01:11:02.824
(ominous music)

1233
01:11:02.874 --> 01:11:05.124
(grunting)

1234
01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:20.139
(suspenseful music)

1235
01:12:02.334 --> 01:12:05.001
- Sheriff Mueller where are you?

1236
01:12:06.965 --> 01:12:10.140
(loud banging)

1237
01:12:10.190 --> 01:12:12.586
Hello, is anyone there!

1238
01:12:12.636 --> 01:12:13.469
Help me!

1239
01:12:14.461 --> 01:12:15.471
Anyone?

1240
01:12:15.521 --> 01:12:16.304
Hello?

1241
01:12:16.354 --> 01:12:17.198
Help me, please let me in!

1242
01:12:17.248 --> 01:12:18.317
- [Narrator] Oh my God it's the Muslim!

1243
01:12:18.367 --> 01:12:20.545
- No, what are you doing!

1244
01:12:20.595 --> 01:12:21.428
Hello!

1245
01:12:22.621 --> 01:12:23.648
Help me!

1246
01:12:23.698 --> 01:12:24.531
Hello!

1247
01:12:25.465 --> 01:12:26.492
What are you doing!

1248
01:12:26.542 --> 01:12:27.602
What the hell are you doing!

1249
01:12:27.652 --> 01:12:29.235
He's gonna kill me!

1250
01:12:32.143 --> 01:12:32.976
- Lana!

1251
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:35.383
Lana!

1252
01:12:41.370 --> 01:12:42.203
Lana!

1253
01:12:48.486 --> 01:12:49.319
Oh shit!

1254
01:13:10.703 --> 01:13:12.269
- Somebody help me!

1255
01:13:12.319 --> 01:13:13.356
Help me please!

1256
01:13:13.406 --> 01:13:14.506
Someone!

1257
01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:16.570
Help me, open the door, open the door.

1258
01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:17.983
Please help me!

1259
01:13:19.118 --> 01:13:21.080
- I'm sorry ma'am I can't do that.

1260
01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:22.270
I don't have keys to the door.

1261
01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.380
You're gonna have to go around!

1262
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:24.760
- You don't understand,
he's gonna kill me!


1263
01:13:24.810 --> 01:13:26.220
He's right there, break the glass!

1264
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:27.084
Do something.

1265
01:13:27.134 --> 01:13:28.882
- I can't do that.

1266
01:13:28.932 --> 01:13:30.089
- Why not?

1267
01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:31.307
- Look, I wanna
help you I really do

1268
01:13:31.357 --> 01:13:32.774
but I just can't!

1269
01:13:34.222 --> 01:13:38.677
I'm already this close
to being fired as it is.


1270
01:13:38.727 --> 01:13:39.950
But I'll show them,

1271
01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:43.223
I'm destined to do great things.

1272
01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:45.900
Who knows,

1273
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:48.550
one day I might even bring
peace to the Middle East.


1274
01:13:49.813 --> 01:13:52.780
- Will you shut the fuck up
and call Sheriff Mueller.


1275
01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:54.250
Tell him it's Lana Shaheed.

1276
01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.905
Lana Shaheed.

1277
01:13:55.955 --> 01:13:57.210
- Shaheed?

1278
01:13:57.260 --> 01:13:58.220
Isn't that Muslim?

1279
01:13:58.270 --> 01:13:59.523
- Call him right now.

1280
01:14:02.216 --> 01:14:05.153
(dramatic music)

1281
01:14:05.203 --> 01:14:06.040
- You too!

1282
01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:08.426
Screw you you jerk!

1283
01:14:08.476 --> 01:14:11.251
(sobbing)

1284
01:14:11.301 --> 01:14:13.968
(ominous music)

1285
01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:05.323
- Get away from me!

1286
01:15:27.672 --> 01:15:28.720
- [Dispatcher] Sheriff
Mueller, we just received


1287
01:15:28.770 --> 01:15:31.170
a distress call from a young
woman asking for your help.


1288
01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:32.920
Her name is Lana Shaheed.

1289
01:15:32.970 --> 01:15:35.180
- It's Mueller, what's her location?

1290
01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:36.013
- [Dispatcher] The call came from the

1291
01:15:36.063 --> 01:15:37.713
Elizabeth Dane Package Plant.

1292
01:15:45.267 --> 01:15:47.381

1293
01:15:47.431 --> 01:15:49.681
(grunting)

1294
01:15:52.046 --> 01:15:53.463
- Leave me alone.

1295
01:16:04.295 --> 01:16:05.233
- Lana!

1296
01:16:05.283 --> 01:16:06.783
- Sheriff Mueller!

1297
01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:09.386

1298
01:16:09.436 --> 01:16:10.936
- Sheriff Mueller!

1299
01:16:17.682 --> 01:16:18.515
I'm here.

1300
01:16:22.274 --> 01:16:24.941
Sheriff Mueller, where'd you go?

1301
01:16:26.269 --> 01:16:27.519
Where'd you go!

1302
01:16:28.354 --> 01:16:29.687
Sheriff Mueller!

1303
01:16:33.934 --> 01:16:35.101
- Lana, catch!

1304
01:16:40.453 --> 01:16:41.600
(clanking)

1305
01:16:41.650 --> 01:16:43.759

1319
01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:51.293
- Are you okay?

1320
01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:57.650
I had to tell Pepe about his sister.

1321

- I'll take care of him.

1322

Blanca would of wanted me to.

1323
01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.700
- I'm really sorry about your friends.

1324
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.430
- They were good people Sheriff Mueller.

1325
01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:14.730
They didn't deserve this.

1326
01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:19.300
- Just hang tight, the

1327
01:18:22.710 --> 01:18:24.843
- Can they stop
by somewhere before we go?

1328
01:18:27.196 --> 01:18:28.440

1329
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:30.440
that's more important than your health?

(singing in foreign language)

1334
01:20:26.257 --> 01:20:29.674
(light triumphant music)

1335
01:20:44.008 --> 01:20:46.591
(upbeat music)

1336
01:21:24.543 --> 01:21:26.510
