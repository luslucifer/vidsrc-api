1
00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:58.260
As you all gather
under the sound of my voice today,


2
00:01:00.485 --> 00:01:06.029
I'm here to tell you that one day,
tomorrow will start without me.


3
00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:12.509
I'm also here to tell you that
as long as the good Lord blesses me


4
00:01:12.918 --> 00:01:14.867
with the air in my lungs,

5
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:19.831
I will continuously spread
his mighty word.


6
00:01:22.518 --> 00:01:24.565
I don't fear no man.

7
00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:29.092
I don't fear no organization

8
00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:31.464
or anyone who carries the words

9
00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:35.445
or ill will about someone
or something coming for me.


10
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.796
We, as a collective, have work to do,

11
00:01:42.617 --> 00:01:46.975
and that work cannot be done
while looking over our shoulders,


12
00:01:49.417 --> 00:01:55.624
sitting around, and hoping that
the same people who seek to do us harm


13
00:01:55.925 --> 00:01:58.815
will wake up
and just decide to do right by us.


14
00:02:01.168 --> 00:02:03.111
I don't know about you,

15
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.135
but I cannot effectively do
anything right


16
00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:08.744
while living in fear.

17
00:02:11.587 --> 00:02:14.575
I'm placing my trust in the Lord.

18
00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:20.862
I want all of us to pray
for our brothers and sisters--


19
00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:49.187
My boy from Troy,

20
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.102
you're sure you want
to still walk this walk with us?


21
00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:05.737
You mean to tell me
that a man of your intelligence,


22
00:03:05.883 --> 00:03:07.638
a man that ,

23
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.316
cannot find a better word
right now than walk?


24
00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:19.634
What did I write and say to you
six years ago in '57?


25
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.069
I said that-

26
00:03:22.198 --> 00:03:26.923
You don't mind getting in trouble
as long as it's good trouble.


27
00:03:29.088 --> 00:03:30.674
And that it is.

28
00:03:33.135 --> 00:03:34.970
Let me say this, my little brother,

29
00:03:36.067 --> 00:03:39.737
I for one, thought
we were going to die on that bridge.


30
00:03:41.107 --> 00:03:43.648
That nasty old Connor
setting up dogs on us


31
00:03:43.718 --> 00:03:45.163
like we weren't even human.

32
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.638
Screaming on that blowhorn
that we were disobeying a parade order.


33
00:03:50.067 --> 00:03:52.241
I actually thought
we were going to get arrested.


34
00:03:57.511 --> 00:04:00.081
You know I packed myself
two books to read,


35
00:04:01.055 --> 00:04:02.692
but once we got in that cell,

36
00:04:03.525 --> 00:04:06.589
you could
an apple and an orange


37
00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:09.521
just so I can
have me something to eat.

38
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.551
You and my brother A.D.
with these oranges.


39
00:04:12.838 --> 00:04:14.914
That's cause we don't

40
00:04:15.478 --> 00:04:17.450
I can't argue with you on that.

41
00:04:18.876 --> 00:04:24.274
Lo and behold, I find myself
side of a paddywagon,


42
00:04:25.234 --> 00:04:26.980
bagging my skull fracture.

43
00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:30.885
Brother Lewis, in my heart
I know that everything we're doing


44
00:04:31.074 --> 00:04:33.422
is so precious and so necessary,

45
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.909
and I must stand up for it
with everything in me.


46
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.532
I must speak up and speak out.

47
00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:50.175
And I will be standing, locked arms
and with you every time out.


48
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.848
When that governor yelled out,

49
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.923
"Troopers advance,"

50
00:05:06.495 --> 00:05:12.005
I thought right where I was standing
surely was where I was going to die.


51
00:05:14.744 --> 00:05:16.547
I kept telling the police,

52
00:05:18.227 --> 00:05:20.984
"Just arrest us.
You don't have to beat us."


53
00:05:21.163 --> 00:05:22.772
We came in peace.

54
00:05:23.427 --> 00:05:26.161
I declare,
I must have said several times--


55
00:05:26.307 --> 00:05:28.612
I know I repeated it several times,

56
00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:33.596
"Officers, if we're doing something wrong
outside of our permit,


57
00:05:33.761 --> 00:05:35.323
just arrest us."

58
00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:40.090
I'm tired, Dr. King.

59
00:05:41.045 --> 00:05:43.638
I ain't even 30 yet, and I'm tired.

60
00:05:44.368 --> 00:05:46.862
I'm tired of my freedom.

61
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.405
America has failed us on its promise.

62
00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:56.852
We must be free now.

63
00:05:57.116 --> 00:05:59.398
They want to give us
a taste of freedom here,


64
00:06:00.396 --> 00:06:02.142
and a sprinkle a bit over there.

65
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.907
Got folks taking literacy tests
and telling them they have to pass it


66
00:06:06.024 --> 00:06:08.542
before one can even attempt
to register to vote.


67
00:06:11.191 --> 00:06:14.391
They don't even want to acknowledge
our right to lawfully assemble,


68
00:06:15.544 --> 00:06:17.375
let alone protect us when we do.

69
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.681
Brother Lewis, where we are right now,

70
00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:24.311
I wouldn't want you
to waste any more energy


71
00:06:24.448 --> 00:06:27.036
trying to separate something
that can't be separated.


72
00:06:31.328 --> 00:06:32.584
Why am I here?

73
00:06:34.735 --> 00:06:36.307
Why are you here?

74
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.332
Do you really have to ask me that?

75
00:06:40.236 --> 00:06:42.024
Why are we here?

76
00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:47.205
Y'all are here to help me
in some way shape or form.


77
00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:49.577
For the third and final time,

78
00:06:49.652 --> 00:06:51.954
I am not interested
in backstabbing Dr. King.


79
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:56.180
You are very loyal
to somebody that's not loyal to you.


80
00:06:57.445 --> 00:07:00.561
Please tell me
what the fuck is wrong with you.


81
00:07:00.975 --> 00:07:04.551
I mean, are you going to stand
strong by a man


82
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:07.888
who backed away from you
on account of your lifestyle?


83
00:07:08.354 --> 00:07:13.304
The same man
who caved in to the suggestion


84
00:07:13.417 --> 00:07:16.015
that if he continues to work with you,

85
00:07:16.109 --> 00:07:20.500
the press will spread lies about
you two actually being homosexual lovers,


86
00:07:21.083 --> 00:07:24.998
even we all know that there's
only one closet in the whole room,


87
00:07:25.097 --> 00:07:26.990
and you're the only gay man in it.

88
00:07:27.158 --> 00:07:28.631
Well, you know my story.

89
00:07:30.151 --> 00:07:33.060
I'm an African-American man
fighting segregation,


90
00:07:33.337 --> 00:07:35.761
I'm an openly gay man
fighting homophobia,


91
00:07:36.551 --> 00:07:38.420
and I'm a pacifist fighting war.

92
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.918
Open, closeted,
no matter how you dress it up,


93
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.671
we all know that Dr. King
is going to be nowhere near you


94
00:07:45.742 --> 00:07:46.923
in any photographs.

95
00:07:47.088 --> 00:07:50.890
As a matter of fact, he's been told
to keep you out of sight, or else.


96
00:07:51.031 --> 00:07:53.111
And you're a key advisor at that.

97
00:07:53.747 --> 00:07:57.403
It makes one wonder,
how valuable are you?


98
00:07:57.624 --> 00:08:00.514
Russ is a great man.

99
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.968
Yes, he's a minority within a minority,

100
00:08:04.758 --> 00:08:07.808
but you'll always catch him out
on the front-line


101
00:08:08.391 --> 00:08:13.455
willing to die for everything
that he speaks on.


102
00:08:15.196 --> 00:08:19.441
If he is so smart,
why doesn't he realize he's being used?


103
00:08:20.368 --> 00:08:21.874
Why are you doing this?

104
00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:27.003
This man decides
to live his life as so he pleases.


105
00:08:27.177 --> 00:08:32.245
However, you, Roy, Clayton,
Hoover, have decided to--


106
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.892
No, no, no, it's all right. 
It's all right.

107
00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:36.528
That Hoover got some nerve,
but you know what?


108
00:08:36.932 --> 00:08:38.876
I can't put all this at his feet.

109
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.622
Now, you say that you got
all these so-called negro leaders


110
00:08:42.702 --> 00:08:44.620
eating out the palm of your hand,

111
00:08:45.012 --> 00:08:46.801
but that's because they're scared.

112
00:08:47.356 --> 00:08:49.704
Scared to live any kind of free.

113
00:08:49.841 --> 00:08:51.845
Now, you can't threaten me

114
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.697
or hold anything against me
or over my head.


115
00:08:55.431 --> 00:08:57.158
Are you confused, son?

116
00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:01.182
Are you clueless as to
what you want to put up first?


117
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.309
You don't know
whether you want to be out there


118
00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:08.104
just championing gay rights

119
00:09:08.217 --> 00:09:11.450
or whether you want
to keep masquerading it around


120
00:09:11.582 --> 00:09:13.972
as though you're fighting
for civil rights.


121
00:09:14.241 --> 00:09:16.702
My resume speaks for itself, sir,

122
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.382
that I will always fight for the rights
of my fellow civil rights leaders.


123
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:22.965
I will oppose
the Southern segregationists


124
00:09:23.055 --> 00:09:25.182
who don't like
the whole civil rights thing,


125
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.180
my white agent friend,

126
00:09:27.737 --> 00:09:31.892
and as long as I live, I will oppose
the Northern liberals who are--


127
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.657
What did you say? They were looking
for a more cautious approach?


128
00:09:36.688 --> 00:09:41.281
We all know exactly what you do.

129
00:09:41.954 --> 00:09:45.911
We also know that you will always be
relegated to the background.


130
00:09:47.563 --> 00:09:52.236
I want to thank you, though,
for toning down that Lewis speech


131
00:09:52.589 --> 00:09:56.471
away from the militant direction
that he was planning on going.


132
00:09:56.641 --> 00:10:01.017
You know, these wiretaps,
they keep us up at night,


133
00:10:01.121 --> 00:10:04.787
but they keep us on our toes
and up to speed big time.


134
00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:09.563
This man played a major part

135
00:10:09.648 --> 00:10:11.605
in orchestrating
the I Have A Dream speech.


136
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:19.897
This man played a major role
in organizing the buses to D.C.,


137
00:10:20.005 --> 00:10:23.780
while making sure marchers had
adequate bathroom facilities


138
00:10:23.874 --> 00:10:25.662
and medical care if needed.

139
00:10:26.278 --> 00:10:31.370
Now, as you say,
you hear him on your wiretaps,


140
00:10:31.375 --> 00:10:37.088
I'm sure you do, then you know that
he's not out here trying to hurt anybody.


141
00:10:41.295 --> 00:10:44.937
This man did this,
and this man did that,

142
00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:47.860
and this man helped start the SCLC,

143
00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:50.824
and this man did
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.


144
00:10:51.074 --> 00:10:55.507
All we know that is this man ain't
in the long-term plans of the team.


145
00:10:56.975 --> 00:10:58.655
You know what?
You're just wasting our time


146
00:10:58.749 --> 00:11:01.252
with these divisive tactics and thoughts.

147
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.864
I know my role
and I know my worth.

148
00:11:04.551 --> 00:11:07.078
What has any of that gotten you?

149
00:11:07.149 --> 00:11:09.502
It's about to get
the shit smacked out of you.


150
00:11:09.577 --> 00:11:11.045
Look here, look here.

151
00:11:11.168 --> 00:11:14.020
The man's own assistant
doesn't even practice non-violence.


152
00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:17.610
Ever hear anything like that
on your wiretaps?


153
00:11:17.728 --> 00:11:20.932
Clyde, do not try me
because I'm not that far removed.


154
00:11:21.135 --> 00:11:22.509
Bottom-line, I can't help you.

155
00:11:22.594 --> 00:11:23.996
And he never will.

156
00:11:25.888 --> 00:11:27.403
Stay your course, Russ.

157
00:11:29.003 --> 00:11:31.116
You are fighting a good fight,
my brother,


158
00:11:31.812 --> 00:11:36.114
and what they're doing, it ain't it.

159
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:42.490
Miss Lorraine, do you realize
what kind of shit we got on tape


160
00:11:42.584 --> 00:11:44.325
on this negro gentleman?

161
00:11:44.429 --> 00:11:46.928
Pardon my French, but fuck your tapes.

162
00:11:47.549 --> 00:11:50.900
Just because you say you have something
doesn't mean you really have it.


163
00:11:51.271 --> 00:11:54.956
All this pressure you're applying,
believe you me,


164
00:11:55.252 --> 00:11:57.125
it is nothing we haven't seen before.

165
00:11:57.935 --> 00:11:59.238
Oh, really?

166
00:11:59.337 --> 00:12:00.702
Yes, really.

167
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.116
You say you listen in on everybody,

168
00:12:05.412 --> 00:12:08.165
but yet you had the nerve
to hire a black sister


169
00:12:08.283 --> 00:12:10.721
to file a bogus report

170
00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.090
about being raped in a room
while Martin just sat there watching.


171
00:12:16.584 --> 00:12:22.043
Just another sign of how stupid
and desperate you all are.


172
00:12:22.405 --> 00:12:25.732
How is a bunch of FBI agents
going to sit in a room next door


173
00:12:25.831 --> 00:12:28.951
and listen to a rape in progress?

174
00:12:29.069 --> 00:12:30.462
You know what?

175
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.123
That would be a crime onto itself.

176
00:12:32.203 --> 00:12:33.483
It certainly would.

177
00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.681
Now, if you two ain't going to come right,
then don't come at all.


178
00:12:38.349 --> 00:12:39.808
What y'all say?

179
00:12:40.085 --> 00:12:41.582
You know what I say about that?

180
00:12:41.709 --> 00:12:43.892
I'll tell you what I
got to say about that.

181
00:12:44.067 --> 00:12:48.297
I'll say I got something on the both of y'all
that'll make you change your minds.


182
00:12:48.895 --> 00:12:50.965
Now we're getting somewhere.

183
00:12:54.725 --> 00:12:58.829
Make sure you verbally tell him
to pull back on.


184
00:12:59.238 --> 00:13:03.676
So you all can focus
on some alleged extramarital affairs?


185
00:13:04.551 --> 00:13:06.222
Little caved in, huh?

186
00:13:06.316 --> 00:13:07.864
Just do as you're told.

187
00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.410
So you're my handler, huh?

188
00:15:29.351 --> 00:15:32.184
White motherfuckers sure know
how to distance themselves.


189
00:15:32.787 --> 00:15:35.991
Your lady, she's doing too much
at her church.


190
00:15:36.147 --> 00:15:37.591
We need you to tone her down.

191
00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:40.429
She's not really the type
to be quiet like that.


192
00:15:40.537 --> 00:15:45.182
Well, the way that people,
she needs to be given a shot.


193
00:15:45.775 --> 00:15:46.984
Excuse me?

194
00:15:47.215 --> 00:15:51.450
Look, I know what you're capable of,
and that's why I'm here.


195
00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.857
Don't ever expect to see my face again.

196
00:15:56.302 --> 00:15:58.485
The people you need
are all in that folder


197
00:15:58.598 --> 00:16:00.467
and they will be in contact,

198
00:16:03.803 --> 00:16:05.864
and fall back off the.

199
00:16:12.467 --> 00:16:16.834
I done told you,
I don't want no blood on my hands.


200
00:16:17.078 --> 00:16:21.521
Now we done told you that it's too late
not to have blood on your hands.


201
00:16:22.137 --> 00:16:27.008
Now, your friend,
or should I say your leader,


202
00:16:27.657 --> 00:16:31.940
he's going to be expiring
very, very soon as I see it.


203
00:16:33.445 --> 00:16:34.984
And we thank you.

204
00:16:35.902 --> 00:16:37.845
You know,
you've put yourself in a position


205
00:16:38.001 --> 00:16:41.337
where you might have yourself
a front-row seat,


206
00:16:41.723 --> 00:16:44.956
and might be standing right next to him
when it all happens.


207
00:16:46.678 --> 00:16:48.330
I don't want this blood money.

208
00:16:49.892 --> 00:16:53.003
You want to know what's the best thing
we can do for you right now?


209
00:16:53.168 --> 00:16:54.448
I'm listening.

210
00:16:54.608 --> 00:16:58.904
The best thing we can do for your ass
is have our guys not shoot you too.


211
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.420
I might go to
the local cops with this.

212
00:17:02.824 --> 00:17:03.930
Yes, you just do that.

213
00:17:04.005 --> 00:17:05.968
Would you like me to tell you
who to ask for?


214
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.283
No, this shit has got to prove something.

215
00:17:08.443 --> 00:17:12.862
Nigga, there are more people out
to quiet King than you think.


216
00:17:13.695 --> 00:17:17.516
The people at the police precinct,
they're tired of all this shit,


217
00:17:18.194 --> 00:17:21.422
and those brothers at the--

218
00:17:21.587 --> 00:17:24.448
Among the common folk at the SCLC,

219
00:17:24.702 --> 00:17:28.537
they're just dying to get on line
and take his spot.


220
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:31.577
We have people such as yourself

221
00:17:31.681 --> 00:17:36.085
that we could just wave a few dollars
in their face and then, boom.


222
00:17:37.568 --> 00:17:42.015
Oh, looks like we got ourselves
a co-conspirator.


223
00:18:01.596 --> 00:18:02.932
Thank you.

224
00:18:03.017 --> 00:18:04.132
You're welcome.

225
00:18:12.292 --> 00:18:13.864
They're coming for you, Martin.

226
00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:20.038
I am so sorry
that God put this mission on you.


227
00:18:22.937 --> 00:18:24.547
A few of us--

228
00:18:24.829 --> 00:18:28.114
A group of us have been approached
by the FBI, and I--


229
00:18:28.212 --> 00:18:32.532
Lady Lorraine,
I refuse to live my life in fear.


230
00:18:33.591 --> 00:18:35.765
My fight for justice and equality--

231
00:18:35.855 --> 00:18:39.878
Martin, the people that you're fighting
aren't fighting you clean.


232
00:18:42.523 --> 00:18:45.690
Tell me what part
of that you don't get?

233
00:18:45.803 --> 00:18:48.740
I'm not concerned about
the power of those I'm fighting.


234
00:18:49.158 --> 00:18:52.081
I'm more concerned
with my people and the liberties--


235
00:18:52.142 --> 00:18:53.328
Their liberties?

236
00:18:54.052 --> 00:18:55.610
Their liberties, Martin?

237
00:18:57.798 --> 00:19:01.916
Will you be alive
to see those liberties utilized?


238
00:19:03.445 --> 00:19:06.514
They are trying to infiltrate
to your friends.


239
00:19:06.834 --> 00:19:10.255
It was one of your friends
that sent that package to Coretta,


240
00:19:11.257 --> 00:19:14.725
common folk sitting amongst us in church

241
00:19:16.278 --> 00:19:17.417
pretending to worship.

242
00:19:17.502 --> 00:19:20.260
I refuse to fight
and go to the depths of shame


243
00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:21.864
that Director Hoover has chosen.

244
00:19:21.944 --> 00:19:23.756
While Hoover spares
no course to break you?


245
00:19:23.982 --> 00:19:27.888
Telling all the press that you're
some lying negro ass preacher?


246
00:19:30.688 --> 00:19:35.812
Lady Lorraine,
when we do as our enemies do to us


247
00:19:36.391 --> 00:19:39.285
and we decide to fight for an eye--

248
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.095
I wish you would stop
making everything a goddamn speech


249
00:19:42.175 --> 00:19:45.591
and deal with these people on the level
that they need to be dealt with.


250
00:19:48.161 --> 00:19:50.740
Can I talk to my friend right now?

251
00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.711
I am your friend.

252
00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:01.723
Don't go near that window, Martin.

253
00:20:04.932 --> 00:20:11.968
Someone close to you
is playing both sides of the fence.


254
00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:20.071
Now, I can't say anything now,

255
00:20:21.427 --> 00:20:25.351
but I feel uneasy about
that photographer that you have on staff.


256
00:20:25.638 --> 00:20:29.794
Yes, he's new to the town,
but his background checked out.


257
00:20:30.824 --> 00:20:32.923
He's also a cousin of Sister Martha.

258
00:20:36.824 --> 00:20:41.163
Well, from what I'm hearing, whoever it is,

259
00:20:42.212 --> 00:20:47.502
they're being instructed to not wear
a necktie to certain speaking engagements.


260
00:20:53.012 --> 00:20:55.958
I'm praying you'll be careful
around these sources you have.


261
00:20:56.443 --> 00:20:58.787
They keep approaching you for a reason,

262
00:20:59.045 --> 00:21:00.763
which could only mean

263
00:21:01.723 --> 00:21:04.377
they have something in sight for you
that won't end well.


264
00:21:13.031 --> 00:21:14.420
I can't take this.

265
00:21:14.744 --> 00:21:18.467
That damn Agent Fisher,
he followed me here this morning.


266
00:21:18.664 --> 00:21:19.940
What?

267
00:21:20.038 --> 00:21:23.940
Girl, he wants to know how we doing
with poisoning the Reverend.


268
00:21:24.476 --> 00:21:26.711
He even had the
nerve to grab my arm.

269
00:21:26.782 --> 00:21:27.751
What?

270
00:21:27.836 --> 00:21:31.864
You know him and that other one,
they sit outside our place every night.


271
00:21:31.982 --> 00:21:34.937
They do that same thing to me.

272
00:21:35.436 --> 00:21:38.838
My husband had to call the cops
on them a few times.


273
00:21:38.998 --> 00:21:41.822
Sitting in their car
shining their light through the house.


274
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:45.107
What? , did the cops come by you?

275
00:21:45.314 --> 00:21:48.260
Yes, ain't do nothing.

276
00:21:48.396 --> 00:21:51.756
Said them men ain't breaking no laws
in that car,


277
00:21:52.038 --> 00:21:54.923
and have all rights
to sit there at that.

278
00:21:55.017 --> 00:21:56.415
That's cause they're white folks.

279
00:21:56.476 --> 00:21:58.203
They can't come in here and blend in,

280
00:21:58.307 --> 00:22:00.636
so they got to send us in there
to do their dirty work.


281
00:22:00.721 --> 00:22:03.780
You know what?
I'm scared for Reverend King.


282
00:22:03.888 --> 00:22:05.535
I'm really scared for him.

283
00:22:05.638 --> 00:22:09.403
These white folks, they have the power

284
00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.631
to come in here
and find somebody to harm us.


285
00:22:12.796 --> 00:22:16.029
They're really unpredictable,
these white folk.


286
00:22:16.358 --> 00:22:20.368
You know, Mother Alberta,
that's her biggest fear.


287
00:22:20.749 --> 00:22:23.620
That one day,
someone's going to walk in here


288
00:22:24.085 --> 00:22:27.464
and just start shooting worshipers.

289
00:22:27.761 --> 00:22:29.577
It's a scary time I'll tell you.

290
00:22:29.662 --> 00:22:33.671
A scary time that you can't even feel safe
in the house of the Lord.


291
00:22:33.794 --> 00:22:38.358
I've been trying to get to the Reverend
through Deacon Clyde


292
00:22:38.965 --> 00:22:41.911
that I need to meet with him
as soon as possible.


293
00:22:42.476 --> 00:22:45.408
Well, we can't stop praying for him.

294
00:22:46.297 --> 00:22:51.201
Sister Florence, I'm here,
and I'm tired of praying.


295
00:22:51.328 --> 00:22:52.857
I want to do some fighting.

296
00:22:52.984 --> 00:22:54.283
You understand?

297
00:22:54.382 --> 00:22:58.048
I want to hurt
some of them whites so bad.


298
00:22:58.264 --> 00:22:59.568
Let me tell you something,

299
00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:05.591
God ain't intend for us
to be and bitten by dogs.


300
00:23:05.676 --> 00:23:06.852
You understand?

301
00:23:06.937 --> 00:23:08.580
That's not the way, Virginia.

302
00:23:09.761 --> 00:23:13.342
We have to be mindful
that we have children to raise.


303
00:23:13.445 --> 00:23:14.895
And this not what God wants.

304
00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:18.467
Now hold on now,
they to kill our children,


305
00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:21.158
so what are we waiting for to respond?

306
00:23:21.497 --> 00:23:24.358
The Reverend does not preach violence.

307
00:23:24.622 --> 00:23:26.961
Well, what we going to do?

308
00:23:27.182 --> 00:23:30.744
We're going to keep marching,
we're going to keep protesting,


309
00:23:30.871 --> 00:23:33.201
and we're just going to wait our turn
so we can die?


310
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.735
Huh, Martha? Tell me.

311
00:23:34.834 --> 00:23:37.507
Did you see what happened to Malcolm?

312
00:23:38.165 --> 00:23:41.290
Where's the help
for Betty and them children?


313
00:23:41.422 --> 00:23:42.457
Now, hold on.

314
00:23:42.603 --> 00:23:43.700
Yes, I see what happened,

315
00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.914
and also see what happened
to my two cousins


316
00:23:47.008 --> 00:23:48.420
and those three little girls

317
00:23:48.523 --> 00:23:51.535
down at 16th Street Baptist Church
five years ago.


318
00:23:51.629 --> 00:23:52.932
I seen it.

319
00:23:53.036 --> 00:23:58.010
Look, we're going to protest peacefully
until things are better.


320
00:23:58.504 --> 00:24:00.034
Peacefully?

321
00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.871
We can't even come
to the church in peace.

322
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:04.970
You just said this morning

323
00:24:05.375 --> 00:24:06.975
that they followed you--

324
00:24:07.088 --> 00:24:08.250
No, hold on.

325
00:24:08.349 --> 00:24:10.090
You just said that they followed you.

326
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:13.507
You let me know,
is that bruise on your arm there


327
00:24:13.831 --> 00:24:15.417
intended to be put there?

328
00:24:15.492 --> 00:24:17.031
Don't you question my God.

329
00:24:17.135 --> 00:24:18.716
Now, hold on, sister--

330
00:24:18.815 --> 00:24:19.850
Ladies, ladies--

331
00:24:19.935 --> 00:24:23.102
Oh, no, no,
I'm questioning everybody but God.


332
00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:27.511
Ladies, this is exactly what they want.

333
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.076
They want us divided.

334
00:24:30.278 --> 00:24:32.377
They want us fighting each other.

335
00:24:32.645 --> 00:24:36.147
We need to pull it together
cause we can't win like this.


336
00:24:36.396 --> 00:24:37.831
We got to pull it together

337
00:24:38.071 --> 00:24:42.255
so we'll know who's with us
and who is not.


338
00:24:42.777 --> 00:24:45.831
Well, people can't be with you
if their needs are different.


339
00:24:45.972 --> 00:24:47.968
Let's get back to this later.

340
00:24:48.438 --> 00:24:51.681
Right now, let's focus on the man--

341
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:54.692
Protecting the man of God.

342
00:24:54.895 --> 00:24:58.692
Regardless of how
you two want to move forward,


343
00:24:59.765 --> 00:25:02.565
they are coming for the King.

344
00:25:23.808 --> 00:25:25.540
My lady showed me her arm.

345
00:25:26.363 --> 00:25:28.843
Well, you weren't moving
fast enough for me,


346
00:25:29.154 --> 00:25:31.808
so I had to take some action
to get your attention.


347
00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:36.307
We both know I'm not a big fan
of this Martin guy, right?


348
00:25:37.916 --> 00:25:40.391
I think that's the highlight
of your recruitment


349
00:25:40.485 --> 00:25:42.390
and your jacket, Beaumont.

350
00:25:42.707 --> 00:25:46.824
The same jacket will tell you
that I don't mind spending


351
00:25:47.111 --> 00:25:52.005
a day, or weeks,
or even years in jail.

352
00:25:54.081 --> 00:25:55.968
Is that right, 
Agent Coleman?

353
00:25:58.782 --> 00:26:02.302
Is what I'm asking you correct,
Agent Coleman?


354
00:26:02.471 --> 00:26:04.132
Sounds about right to me.

355
00:26:04.561 --> 00:26:06.692
Okay, great.

356
00:26:08.928 --> 00:26:10.655
With that being said,

357
00:26:10.932 --> 00:26:14.198
don't you ever put
your pale fucking hands


358
00:26:14.415 --> 00:26:15.930
on my lady again.

359
00:26:16.363 --> 00:26:18.292
You know what I'm good at.

360
00:26:18.852 --> 00:26:22.198
I can make your death
look just like a suicide.


361
00:26:22.387 --> 00:26:23.864
All right.

362
00:26:24.245 --> 00:26:25.925
Family's off-limits.

363
00:26:26.114 --> 00:26:28.998
From this moment on,
family is off-limits.


364
00:26:29.092 --> 00:26:32.165
Don't try satisfying
my fucking ears right now.


365
00:26:32.307 --> 00:26:34.674
You motherfuckers have no conscience.

366
00:26:35.158 --> 00:26:37.436
Family should have always been off-limits,

367
00:26:38.001 --> 00:26:39.972
and why the fuck
are y'all calling that man's house


368
00:26:40.076 --> 00:26:41.587
threatening his wife and kids?

369
00:26:42.052 --> 00:26:43.516
Why the fuck do you care?

370
00:26:43.629 --> 00:26:45.958
Since when a man
that we hired to work hand-in-hand


371
00:26:46.052 --> 00:26:47.996
with selected mafia associates,

372
00:26:48.194 --> 00:26:52.961
only to target wanted KKK members,
develop a soft spot?


373
00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:58.462
They made it very clear down in Jackson,
they weren't coming back with us alive.


374
00:26:58.674 --> 00:27:01.304
And y'all decided
not to leave any witnesses


375
00:27:01.417 --> 00:27:02.664
with these incidents, right?

376
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.542
Not me. I have a code.

377
00:27:05.356 --> 00:27:06.721
And we have an assignment.

378
00:27:06.834 --> 00:27:07.987
You and I, we have a duty.

379
00:27:08.057 --> 00:27:09.238
We owe America.

380
00:27:09.417 --> 00:27:10.702
Fuck America.

381
00:27:11.629 --> 00:27:13.620
I don't owe your America shit.

382
00:27:14.062 --> 00:27:17.761
America's been spitting up blood
since the day it was established.


383
00:27:17.972 --> 00:27:21.234
Look at the palm of your hands
and look at the bottom of your boots,


384
00:27:21.643 --> 00:27:24.660
because some of that blood
has been spilled by men like you


385
00:27:24.725 --> 00:27:26.029
and men like me.

386
00:27:26.881 --> 00:27:29.267
Motherfucker, we are not the same.

387
00:27:29.417 --> 00:27:31.318
Oh, yes, the fuck we are.

388
00:27:31.525 --> 00:27:33.050
The only difference between you and me

389
00:27:33.158 --> 00:27:36.052
is people see a killer
the moment they set eyes your way.


390
00:27:36.194 --> 00:27:40.890
You're a perp, nothing but a crime
looking for somewhere to happen.


391
00:27:41.836 --> 00:27:44.208
Fuck you and your thoughts.

392
00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.478
Look, that's the way it is.
I don't make this shit up.


393
00:27:48.321 --> 00:27:51.314
But you're knee-deep in an assignment
to kill a man


394
00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.161
who only wants an even playing ground

395
00:27:54.292 --> 00:27:57.634
for his kids, for his family, and for--

396
00:27:57.723 --> 00:27:59.450
I just see myself

397
00:27:59.775 --> 00:28:03.125
working against any agenda
that allows for coloreds uniting.


398
00:28:04.085 --> 00:28:06.208
You'll never understand
the threat it poses.


399
00:28:06.316 --> 00:28:08.834
Ain't no black messiahs
coming up on my watch.


400
00:28:09.384 --> 00:28:12.740
Now, you just stay in your place
and work on surviving all this.


401
00:28:13.507 --> 00:28:17.591
You know, you should work
on surviving this, too,


402
00:28:18.961 --> 00:28:21.201
cause I know my way
through the suburbs.


403
00:28:21.742 --> 00:28:26.735
I can definitely knock
on your front door in Pine Valley.


404
00:28:29.252 --> 00:28:30.340
You know what?

405
00:28:30.636 --> 00:28:31.864
Scratch that.

406
00:28:32.203 --> 00:28:34.005
I don't really do front doors.

407
00:28:34.725 --> 00:28:39.017
My skin type is not allowed in the front
of any white-owned properties.


408
00:28:40.029 --> 00:28:43.888
Yes, motherfucker,
I know your jacket too.


409
00:28:44.034 --> 00:28:44.923
Beaumont--

410
00:28:45.008 --> 00:28:46.415
Yes, motherfucker.

411
00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:51.431
I know where you lay your head just like
you occasionally know where I lay mine.


412
00:28:51.563 --> 00:28:54.137
I'll kill you if
you come near my family.

413
00:28:54.984 --> 00:28:57.704
You're going to have to
if you come near my lady


414
00:28:57.808 --> 00:28:59.977
or go to her church again without me.

415
00:29:00.692 --> 00:29:02.212
Fuck around if you want,

416
00:29:02.598 --> 00:29:07.747
I'll show you that my lady is
the only black life that matters to me.


417
00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.572
Daddy, daddy, daddy, 
I picked this one.

418
00:29:33.667 --> 00:29:35.060
Can you?

419
00:29:36.194 --> 00:29:38.514
Whoa, does your mother know
you've been in our closet?


420
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:39.888
No, sir. She does not.

421
00:29:41.177 --> 00:29:44.532
You'll get us both in trouble
bringing this shirt down here like this.


422
00:29:44.631 --> 00:29:47.045
How? The other ones are wrinkled, too.

423
00:29:47.187 --> 00:29:51.544
Come here, son.

424
00:29:51.657 --> 00:29:54.528
You tell your mother
I'll be down there shortly.


425
00:29:54.914 --> 00:29:57.949
And that you're not wearing
the one she had ironed?


426
00:29:58.128 --> 00:30:00.923
Just tell your mother
I'll be down there shortly, son.


427
00:30:03.789 --> 00:30:06.702
I know, I'll understand when I'm older.

428
00:30:15.469 --> 00:30:21.347
Your family,
Coretta is raising them children so well.


429
00:30:21.747 --> 00:30:23.855
I don't know what I'd do without her.

430
00:30:27.507 --> 00:30:31.187
Dr. King, I feel like I'm dead already.

431
00:30:32.081 --> 00:30:34.462
I can imagine that feeling hurts,

432
00:30:35.332 --> 00:30:37.860
just as much as my feeling of loneliness.

433
00:30:40.504 --> 00:30:43.375
I tell you, I look around sometimes,

434
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:46.340
it seems like everything
is backing away from me.


435
00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:52.871
Everyone and everything seems so distant,

436
00:30:53.172 --> 00:30:55.182
so out of my reach.

437
00:31:00.001 --> 00:31:02.782
It's like I'm trying so desperately

438
00:31:02.956 --> 00:31:05.417
to reach back and pull my people up,

439
00:31:06.457 --> 00:31:12.589
and at the same time trying to reach up
with my free hand and touch the heavens.


440
00:31:15.709 --> 00:31:21.554
You can't look forward and backward
at the same time.


441
00:31:22.674 --> 00:31:28.132
I say, trust your heart
and trust what you are seeing,


442
00:31:30.598 --> 00:31:32.961
because the God that we serve,

443
00:31:33.535 --> 00:31:40.838
death is small in comparison to.

444
00:31:43.478 --> 00:31:45.172
I just pray it's glory.

445
00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:51.987
I just pray it's glory.

446
00:31:58.777 --> 00:32:02.170
You will do what
we need you to do.

447
00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:04.942
You gave up all your rights
when you decided--


448
00:32:05.041 --> 00:32:08.085
Fisher, Fisher, we need him,
we can't lose him this way.


449
00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:11.968
Trust me, he doesn't talk to me
that much after services.


450
00:32:12.975 --> 00:32:14.467
Trust you?

451
00:32:14.589 --> 00:32:16.692
Trust you?

452
00:32:16.918 --> 00:32:19.878
Yes, that's what I need
you to do, trust me.

453
00:32:20.024 --> 00:32:22.669
He made you a deacon at his church,

454
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.791
how come you are not as willing
to die for him as he is willing to die for you?


455
00:32:27.177 --> 00:32:28.688
Here's how you make it up to us.

456
00:32:28.763 --> 00:32:32.165
Look, I don't want to kill anybody,
and I don't want to see anybody hurt.


457
00:32:32.307 --> 00:32:34.372
You don't have to hurt nobody.

458
00:32:34.542 --> 00:32:39.172
All you have to do is tell him
to do us a big favor and just kill himself.


459
00:32:39.314 --> 00:32:41.624
Then that will be
the only embarrassing thing


460
00:32:41.704 --> 00:32:43.055
the world will ever know.

461
00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:46.801
Who am I supposed to tell them
that this request is coming from?


462
00:32:47.191 --> 00:32:48.476
We don't care.

463
00:32:48.551 --> 00:32:50.984
, you can sort
that out on your own.

464
00:32:51.267 --> 00:32:52.523
Just get it done.

465
00:32:52.683 --> 00:32:54.514
Then upon his death,

466
00:32:54.904 --> 00:33:00.189
we will toss an extra $200
in your direction for all your troubles.


467
00:33:01.445 --> 00:33:03.196
I'll see what I can do.

468
00:33:03.558 --> 00:33:07.460
I know, or we know that you see.

469
00:33:07.808 --> 00:33:10.358
As of now, we need you to do.

470
00:33:11.177 --> 00:33:13.747
The doors of the church are now open.

471
00:33:14.476 --> 00:33:16.340
You guys are going to get yours.

472
00:33:16.829 --> 00:33:19.422
The same vengeance
that God has in store for me,


473
00:33:19.605 --> 00:33:21.507
he has it in store for you also.

474
00:33:21.888 --> 00:33:23.069
You know what?

475
00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.984
You get on home now, you hear?

476
00:33:26.344 --> 00:33:28.057
You got church tomorrow,

477
00:33:28.947 --> 00:33:34.801
and we don't want you to be late
for the Lord on our account, you hear?


478
00:33:40.457 --> 00:33:41.935
Sister Virginia?

479
00:33:42.429 --> 00:33:44.481
Hello Reverend, how are you?

480
00:33:44.636 --> 00:33:46.363
I'm doing just fine.

481
00:33:48.608 --> 00:33:49.963
How did you like the service?

482
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.111
Well, I loved it.

483
00:33:51.201 --> 00:33:52.763
If you didn't, would you tell me?

484
00:33:52.881 --> 00:33:54.095
No, Reverend.

485
00:33:54.344 --> 00:33:58.335
I know, I know, if anybody
was going to tell me, it would be you.


486
00:33:58.876 --> 00:34:02.650
Yes, you got to trust and believe
what God tells you.


487
00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.784
Yes.

488
00:34:03.869 --> 00:34:05.784
I've been meaning to ask you something--

489
00:34:06.528 --> 00:34:08.260
Come on now,
that's what I've been waiting for.


490
00:34:08.358 --> 00:34:09.384
Come on now.

491
00:34:09.497 --> 00:34:11.300
No now, Sister Virginia,

492
00:34:11.751 --> 00:34:13.916
you know we practice
that non-violence over here.


493
00:34:15.384 --> 00:34:17.060
My apologies, Reverend.

494
00:34:17.535 --> 00:34:19.794
You know God is still working on me,

495
00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:23.262
I must say, beginning
where we're at sometimes--


496
00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:26.716
No worries, but I have to ask you,

497
00:34:27.318 --> 00:34:31.097
why do you keep your fist balled up
for the entire service?


498
00:34:33.064 --> 00:34:35.045
Oh, you caught that, huh?

499
00:34:35.968 --> 00:34:37.328
Every Sunday.

500
00:34:37.436 --> 00:34:41.125
Whether my father's preaching,
or if I finally get the chance to preach,


501
00:34:41.907 --> 00:34:46.561
I can see from the pulpit to the back door
you rubbing your knuckles together.


502
00:34:47.017 --> 00:34:50.801
Well, Reverend do you want
the 'we're still in the sanctuary answer'


503
00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:52.556
or do you want me
to give you my answer?


504
00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:54.255
Because I can tell you--

505
00:34:54.490 --> 00:34:56.989
Never mind, never mind.

506
00:34:57.902 --> 00:35:00.796
I just thought it was funny.

507
00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:04.951
I love you, Sister Virginia.

508
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:09.375
I love you too, Reverend,
but before you go,


509
00:35:10.349 --> 00:35:13.403
I have something on my spirit
and I need to get it off.


510
00:35:13.864 --> 00:35:20.020
I'm just not doing too good
with this non-violent stuff, Reverend.


511
00:35:20.147 --> 00:35:25.558
The church and I just feel like

512
00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:30.735
all I know how to do
is use these to fight.


513
00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:33.822
I've been fighting off men my whole life,

514
00:35:34.744 --> 00:35:37.521
I really don't think
I'd want to be out there


515
00:35:37.761 --> 00:35:39.615
with this non-violent protest.

516
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:41.723
I'm no good.
I shouldn't be out there.


517
00:35:45.337 --> 00:35:46.490
I see.

518
00:35:47.497 --> 00:35:49.224
Well, do you have a license?

519
00:35:49.944 --> 00:35:51.563
No sir, I don't.

520
00:35:52.222 --> 00:35:53.963
Well, I'm going to have to scratch that.

521
00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:56.857
I just figured
if was going to get into a tussle,


522
00:35:57.681 --> 00:36:02.151
maybe you could drive the getaway car,
but you ain't got no license.


523
00:36:04.481 --> 00:36:07.003
Now, look here, Reverend,
I ain't got no license,


524
00:36:07.252 --> 00:36:10.170
but ain't said nothing
about I don't know how to drive.


525
00:36:10.269 --> 00:36:12.471
Now, I can do that.

526
00:36:14.448 --> 00:36:16.292
Pastor, can I bend your ear
for a second?


527
00:36:16.481 --> 00:36:18.321
Yes, talk to me.

528
00:36:18.744 --> 00:36:20.551
Is there somewhere
we can talk in private?


529
00:36:20.645 --> 00:36:24.180
If this can wait about two hours,
we can use my study office.


530
00:36:24.325 --> 00:36:27.055
Because right now, I have a meeting
with some of the core leaders


531
00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.450
and leaders of the NAACP.

532
00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:33.521
I got to leave in about 20 minutes,
so I guess we can do our talk here.


533
00:36:36.881 --> 00:36:40.330
I think you want to seriously consider
getting rid of Russ.


534
00:36:41.252 --> 00:36:44.194
Deacon Clyde, not this again.

535
00:36:45.478 --> 00:36:47.111
Look, let me go and get--

536
00:36:47.304 --> 00:36:50.660
Pastor, you're talking
about losing everything, life or death.


537
00:36:50.763 --> 00:36:52.754
Losing everything we've built so far.

538
00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:59.027
Look, me and you
have been to the sandbox,


539
00:36:59.441 --> 00:37:03.130
so I'm going to say it again,
Russ is a good man.


540
00:37:03.375 --> 00:37:05.384
Russ is a gay man.

541
00:37:06.052 --> 00:37:09.309
What he's all about
is going to destroy the movement,


542
00:37:09.408 --> 00:37:10.702
and you know that.

543
00:37:10.852 --> 00:37:14.363
His sissy lifestyle is not conducive
to what we are trying to accomplish.


544
00:37:14.448 --> 00:37:16.500
I'm not going to debate this
with you, my brother.


545
00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:20.048
All the things that you were involved in
and that you left behind,


546
00:37:20.231 --> 00:37:22.900
no man or woman can walk
into this church leadership building


547
00:37:22.989 --> 00:37:25.102
and tell me to cut you off
because of it.


548
00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:27.257
What do you think
they're here to tell you?


549
00:37:27.408 --> 00:37:30.123
What do you think
they're going to say in that meeting?


550
00:37:30.462 --> 00:37:32.123
Like I said--

551
00:37:33.676 --> 00:37:38.090
That the man got caught
with his pants down, literally.


552
00:37:38.669 --> 00:37:41.869
He got caught having sex in a car
with another man,


553
00:37:41.958 --> 00:37:43.841
and a white man at that,

554
00:37:44.278 --> 00:37:47.671
that you have got to get rid of him,
cut him loose.


555
00:37:47.996 --> 00:37:51.417
That arrest warrant he's got,
it's not going to go anywhere.


556
00:37:51.634 --> 00:37:56.655
He committed a lewd act,
got sentenced to 60 days in jail,


557
00:37:57.309 --> 00:38:01.111
and now is a registered sex offender
in the State of California.


558
00:38:02.612 --> 00:38:08.744
Russ was our chief organizer
for the March on Washington.


559
00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:12.476
Montgomery was practically all him.

560
00:38:14.895 --> 00:38:19.700
He introduced me
to the non-violent teachings of Gandhi,


561
00:38:20.194 --> 00:38:23.262
and now they want me
to end my friendship with him


562
00:38:23.412 --> 00:38:24.857
just because he chooses to--

563
00:38:24.951 --> 00:38:28.749
Look, either you could exile him
of your friendship,


564
00:38:29.116 --> 00:38:32.170
or do nothing
and get exiled along with him.


565
00:38:32.452 --> 00:38:36.151
Because believe me, this movement
will go on without him,


566
00:38:36.452 --> 00:38:38.330
and if necessary, without you.

567
00:38:43.676 --> 00:38:45.450
Is this what they're whispering?

568
00:38:45.817 --> 00:38:47.375
It's no whispering.

569
00:38:47.742 --> 00:38:51.271
Please keep your personal dislikes
for him out of this.


570
00:38:51.422 --> 00:38:56.452
He has done all he can,
you just got to get rid of him now.


571
00:38:56.932 --> 00:38:59.742
If not, you can't blame anybody
but yourself


572
00:38:59.827 --> 00:39:01.365
when it all goes downhill.

573
00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.377
I can clearly see
where you stand on this,


574
00:39:04.598 --> 00:39:06.735
and whose side of this that you're on.

575
00:39:07.337 --> 00:39:12.203
I stand on the outside,
outside of a burning house.


576
00:39:14.523 --> 00:39:17.841
You have a good meeting,
peace be with you.


577
00:39:26.269 --> 00:39:29.742
You got one shot,
and one shot only to get this right.


578
00:39:29.845 --> 00:39:32.871
Excuse me,
but I do believe you called me,


579
00:39:33.055 --> 00:39:36.467
and from what you were told,
this is not


580
00:39:36.561 --> 00:39:38.998
This ain't like no entrapment
that you've ever done before.


581
00:39:39.078 --> 00:39:40.490
You got my money?

582
00:39:40.617 --> 00:39:42.020
Slow your ass down.

583
00:39:42.363 --> 00:39:45.530
This money comes with instructions
and consequences.


584
00:39:46.264 --> 00:39:49.417
I usually don't work
with people I don't know, so--


585
00:39:49.591 --> 00:39:53.229
You reached out to a mutual associate,
and they reached out to me,


586
00:39:53.347 --> 00:39:58.165
so apparently, they trust you,
and without a question trust me.


587
00:39:58.876 --> 00:40:01.568
The less I need to know about you,
the better.


588
00:40:02.678 --> 00:40:05.097
I trust that they told you that,
if you do this,


589
00:40:05.347 --> 00:40:08.824
your life as you know it
will never be the same again.


590
00:40:08.951 --> 00:40:12.368
Look, I was told that you needed
a woman like me


591
00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:14.702
to get close to Doctor King

592
00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:18.612
and see if he was even interested
in taking payments.


593
00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:22.260
First off, I'm going to need you
to hold up on that Doctor King shit.


594
00:40:22.768 --> 00:40:25.370
I need someone that can sleep with,
or frame,


595
00:40:25.558 --> 00:40:28.603
or even go public
about Martin Luther King Jr.


596
00:40:29.455 --> 00:40:30.782
Wait, you want me to--?

597
00:40:30.895 --> 00:40:32.490
Sleep with Martin Luther.

598
00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:34.683
I don't know if I--

599
00:40:34.763 --> 00:40:35.850
Need this money?

600
00:40:36.123 --> 00:40:39.394
No, to even be
a part of this mess.

601
00:40:40.316 --> 00:40:42.250
This shit you got going ain't right.

602
00:40:42.956 --> 00:40:44.500
Well, it may be too late now

603
00:40:44.961 --> 00:40:47.332
because you know way more
than you need to.


604
00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:51.892
You're the trouble
that I've been looking for.


605
00:40:52.137 --> 00:40:54.076
Number two, Mr. Nat.

606
00:40:56.311 --> 00:40:58.175
Excuse me, miss.
Can you give us a second?


607
00:40:58.283 --> 00:41:00.062
I need just a minute of his life.

608
00:41:01.149 --> 00:41:02.998
This will only take a few minutes.

609
00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.645
Don't tiptoe too far now, Miss Sophia.

610
00:41:08.071 --> 00:41:10.415
Now I don't know
what kind of colored man are you


611
00:41:10.537 --> 00:41:11.248
but you got a lot-

612
00:41:11.314 --> 00:41:12.749
Let me stop you right there, Pastor.

613
00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:16.481
No, you can't stop me nowhere
or the God I serve.


614
00:41:17.304 --> 00:41:20.641
You're the devil reincarnated.

615
00:41:20.796 --> 00:41:22.528
Nothing but pure evil.

616
00:41:22.843 --> 00:41:24.547
I heard about you.

617
00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:30.551
Yes, white man got you on a payroll
to destroy the MIA and the SCLC.


618
00:41:30.787 --> 00:41:33.041
Well, you better pray a little harder.

619
00:41:33.577 --> 00:41:38.118
My assignment is
way, way, way more than that.


620
00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:40.104
God don't like this.

621
00:41:40.231 --> 00:41:42.961
Motherfucking God don't like me.

622
00:41:48.707 --> 00:41:50.302
Stay away from us.

623
00:41:50.735 --> 00:41:52.575
We out here preaching the good word,

624
00:41:52.697 --> 00:41:55.248
trying to put in a good fight
for good honest black folk.


625
00:41:55.337 --> 00:41:56.669
News flash.

626
00:41:57.295 --> 00:41:59.431
I'm not the only one that's coming.

627
00:41:59.822 --> 00:42:00.918
You know what?

628
00:42:01.121 --> 00:42:05.281
Everybody has a dash
between their birth and their death


629
00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:10.645
and, if it does your heart any good,
I'll preach your funeral for free.


630
00:42:12.796 --> 00:42:14.820
You do that, motherfucker.

631
00:42:15.074 --> 00:42:16.650
Get out of here.

632
00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.860
Sophia, you want this money or what?

633
00:42:26.457 --> 00:42:28.598
Excuse me, Miss Lorraine?

634
00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:30.227
Lorraine, it is, right?

635
00:42:30.358 --> 00:42:35.342
Yes, it is Lady Lorraine but I do believe
you know my name already.


636
00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:38.740
Hot to trot.

637
00:42:39.196 --> 00:42:41.055
I was just making sure.

638
00:42:41.605 --> 00:42:43.135
How can I help you this evening?

639
00:42:43.516 --> 00:42:50.170
You can help all of us by staying out
of Dr. King's face so much.


640
00:42:51.422 --> 00:42:53.412
that would help.

641
00:42:53.657 --> 00:42:55.728
So you know my name

642
00:42:55.808 --> 00:42:59.267
but you don't know
that I'm actually his assistant.


643
00:42:59.365 --> 00:43:01.220
Well, we think that--

644
00:43:01.342 --> 00:43:02.344
We?

645
00:43:04.052 --> 00:43:05.841
Where's the rest of we at?

646
00:43:06.274 --> 00:43:09.332
Didn't the Bible say
all my accusers should be present?


647
00:43:09.488 --> 00:43:12.283
The Bible also speaks about the wicked

648
00:43:12.612 --> 00:43:14.994
and the manner in which
they carry themselves.


649
00:43:15.285 --> 00:43:16.669
Let me reel you back in.

650
00:43:16.758 --> 00:43:19.521
It says that the wicked are amongst us.

651
00:43:20.984 --> 00:43:25.248
How many times have you denied?

652
00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:33.930
You see that's where we go wrong
when we look at a man of God as God.


653
00:43:35.027 --> 00:43:39.803
Now I love my reverends
but I'm not in love with neither of them.


654
00:43:40.834 --> 00:43:43.130
You can kindly take that information

655
00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:47.252
and update whoever it is
that you need to inform.


656
00:43:47.775 --> 00:43:49.502
You see I don't take notes.

657
00:43:50.005 --> 00:43:52.885
That's one of the things that you do

658
00:43:53.069 --> 00:43:56.147
and I know it's going to be hard
for you to keep your legs closed


659
00:43:56.236 --> 00:44:00.532
when you're straddling both sides
of the fence but you go on.


660
00:44:01.121 --> 00:44:03.097
You go on now and play your part.

661
00:44:03.238 --> 00:44:05.789
If I didn't have
something more pressing to do--


662
00:44:05.911 --> 00:44:08.674
Like finishing your itinerary?

663
00:44:08.834 --> 00:44:10.424
I'll get you straight.

664
00:44:10.824 --> 00:44:12.052
Go on now.

665
00:44:12.147 --> 00:44:13.144
Scoot.

666
00:44:13.248 --> 00:44:17.624
I know you've got
to make sure that the people believe


667
00:44:17.728 --> 00:44:20.622
that the poor peoples' march
is still going on.


668
00:44:23.337 --> 00:44:26.222
I'm sure that folks are going to have

669
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:29.982
a lot of good things
to say about you, Sister Florence,


670
00:44:30.302 --> 00:44:33.055
but the sad part is,
and it really is sad,

671
00:44:33.747 --> 00:44:39.027
that you're going to have to die first
before anyone could hear about it.


672
00:44:39.478 --> 00:44:41.144
Well, look at that.

673
00:44:42.895 --> 00:44:45.601
You know you sound just like him now?

674
00:44:46.377 --> 00:44:49.309
I'm not talking about Reverend King.

675
00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:55.309
I'm talking about your half
-Asian

676
00:45:06.688 --> 00:45:09.116
It's 3:06 PM, cousin Virginia.

677
00:45:09.732 --> 00:45:11.662
I'm fixing to get ready for work.

678
00:45:12.147 --> 00:45:16.415
Mr. Walters and Mrs. Laurie
don't play about people being late.


679
00:45:16.612 --> 00:45:21.055
Child, I ran to get you on the phone, Ellen,
and now you want to go running.


680
00:45:21.737 --> 00:45:28.137
I'm running because Mr. King, your pastor,
and his guys are here.


681
00:45:28.387 --> 00:45:30.589
Child, I see the pastor all the time.

682
00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:33.022
Now what you need
to do is call me

683
00:45:33.107 --> 00:45:37.549
when that there Isaac Hayes comes
a night or two at the motel job.


684
00:45:37.996 --> 00:45:40.768
I fed Mr. King and them last night.

685
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:44.509
All they ever order is hamburgers.

686
00:45:45.723 --> 00:45:47.248
What I don't understand

687
00:45:47.384 --> 00:45:50.161
is why they don't have
better security where they are.


688
00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.857
I don't understand that either.

689
00:45:53.111 --> 00:45:57.097
That FBI, they'll watch him,
they'll follow him,


690
00:45:57.238 --> 00:46:00.255
but they don't put no effort
into trying to protect him.


691
00:46:00.598 --> 00:46:04.730
I'm pretty sure the whole town knows
where he's laying his head at.


692
00:46:05.031 --> 00:46:08.871
People come to that hotel all the time
to get a glimpse of him.


693
00:46:09.996 --> 00:46:13.135
I just don't understand
why he came back here


694
00:46:13.215 --> 00:46:15.130
for the sanitation stuff again.

695
00:46:15.252 --> 00:46:19.916
I'm telling you there's this group
that came to town called the Invaders.


696
00:46:20.354 --> 00:46:24.942
They intentionally made
that march violent last month.


697
00:46:26.062 --> 00:46:30.476
Pastor is bent on making
things peaceful this time around.


698
00:46:31.074 --> 00:46:33.568
Cousin, that man is stressed.

699
00:46:35.347 --> 00:46:37.587
Goes out on the balcony smoking.

700
00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:41.892
Parking lot floor
full of cigarette butts.


701
00:46:43.191 --> 00:46:44.650
Then go back into the room

702
00:46:44.754 --> 00:46:48.457
and all you hear
is grown men pillow fighting.


703
00:46:48.787 --> 00:46:49.991
Child, you know what?

704
00:46:50.076 --> 00:46:53.130
I just pray that they make it home.

705
00:46:53.252 --> 00:46:55.182
They all make it home safe.

706
00:46:55.511 --> 00:46:56.782
I really, really do.

707
00:46:56.881 --> 00:47:00.015
I feel something in my spirit, though,
I got to tell you.


708
00:47:00.203 --> 00:47:03.944
I really, really think
that the last time he was there,


709
00:47:04.052 --> 00:47:07.540
there was nothing but a dry run
as to how they was going to set him up.


710
00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:10.707
I'm telling you.
I just feel it in my spirit, girl.


711
00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:14.768
Virginia, I don't want to be
no eye witness to history


712
00:47:16.147 --> 00:47:19.243
so I just work
and keep my mouth shut.


713
00:47:20.358 --> 00:47:23.483
Every time I mention to our boss,

714
00:47:23.605 --> 00:47:25.525
the black couple that owns the hotel,

715
00:47:25.803 --> 00:47:30.250
that Mr. King should probably be
on a less visible side of the hotel,


716
00:47:31.375 --> 00:47:37.064
all they would tell me is
that the room that they gave him


717
00:47:37.168 --> 00:47:39.078
was the one they were told
to place him in.


718
00:47:39.177 --> 00:47:41.285
Now how are they going to let
somebody else


719
00:47:41.436 --> 00:47:43.375
tell them where to place somebody?

720
00:47:43.676 --> 00:47:45.403
How they do that?

721
00:47:45.558 --> 00:47:48.730
Ellen, I'm going to let you go, okay?

722
00:47:48.848 --> 00:47:50.904
Now, whatever you do,
be careful out there now.


723
00:47:50.998 --> 00:47:52.307
I love you.

724
00:47:52.711 --> 00:47:54.970
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

725
00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.895
Does your pastor know what a friendly is?

726
00:48:01.817 --> 00:48:06.010
Does your reverend know that
he is only a citizen of this here country


727
00:48:06.231 --> 00:48:10.951
and he is not a citizen
or a spokesperson for the entire world?


728
00:48:11.342 --> 00:48:16.885
Does Dr. King understand that
the speech he made a year to this day


729
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:20.175
about his opposition
to the war in Vietnam


730
00:48:20.292 --> 00:48:23.168
is what started crafting his own eulogy?

731
00:48:23.422 --> 00:48:24.867
Hold on.

732
00:48:25.012 --> 00:48:26.909
Are you going to let me answer?

733
00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:31.078
There is no longer an opportunity
for any answers, Sister Virginia.


734
00:48:31.285 --> 00:48:33.544
Well, let me tell you this here, sister.

735
00:48:33.822 --> 00:48:37.215
It's just about time we stop
scratching where there's no itch


736
00:48:37.351 --> 00:48:40.180
and we stop laughing
where there's no tickle.


737
00:48:40.523 --> 00:48:45.520
I agree but forces like J. Edgar and

738
00:48:46.015 --> 00:48:47.784
are doing everything in their power

739
00:48:47.883 --> 00:48:51.572
to make sure that Martin doesn't make it
to his poor people campaign


740
00:48:51.869 --> 00:48:53.041
in Washington.

741
00:48:56.095 --> 00:48:59.577
Can you please explain to us
the reason for this last-minute meeting?


742
00:48:59.987 --> 00:49:02.777
Make it quick because I got
somewhere that I need to be.


743
00:49:02.937 --> 00:49:06.245
Inside each envelope
is what is needed of you next.


744
00:49:06.768 --> 00:49:10.100
The location where you will be
at the time of each event,


745
00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:13.784
the allegations
that you will put forth through


746
00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:16.838
the press outlets that we will be providing,

747
00:49:17.337 --> 00:49:21.648
and, last but not least,
the best gift of all, your final payments.


748
00:49:22.608 --> 00:49:23.944
Where's my plane ticket?

749
00:49:24.052 --> 00:49:25.172
Plane ticket?

750
00:49:25.375 --> 00:49:26.391
Child, where you going?

751
00:49:26.476 --> 00:49:30.057
Martha, I believe you have
enough money in your envelope


752
00:49:30.137 --> 00:49:32.001
to cover your ticket to Memphis.

753
00:49:32.871 --> 00:49:35.540
I didn't know
that you was going down to Memphis.


754
00:49:36.636 --> 00:49:40.697
Who are you and why am I paying
for my own ticket?


755
00:49:40.928 --> 00:49:44.274
You don't expect me
to start a paper trail, do you?


756
00:49:44.391 --> 00:49:46.485
Do you think that
would be wise of me?

757
00:49:46.641 --> 00:49:49.102
How are we going to explain her
not being in church?


758
00:49:49.789 --> 00:49:51.525
Something ain't right.

759
00:49:53.238 --> 00:49:54.485
You're leaving us out to dry.

760
00:49:54.561 --> 00:49:55.634
You know that, don't you?

761
00:49:55.723 --> 00:49:56.881
Miss Walker-

762
00:49:57.088 --> 00:49:59.144
My name is Marie St. Jean.

763
00:49:59.577 --> 00:50:03.083
Sister Martha, you can spend
the money as you wish.


764
00:50:03.398 --> 00:50:06.998
Yes, do as you wish,
but if I were you,

765
00:50:07.205 --> 00:50:10.217
I would make it my business
to make it to Memphis.


766
00:50:10.462 --> 00:50:13.285
Fisher, who is this

767
00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:17.987
and why am I paying out
of my own pocket for my own flight?


768
00:50:18.241 --> 00:50:19.869
You know, y'all are still not telling us

769
00:50:19.991 --> 00:50:21.751
how we are supposed
to cover for ourselves.


770
00:50:21.968 --> 00:50:23.916
Do y'all got a
plan in place for this?

771
00:50:24.208 --> 00:50:26.387
There is a plan in place.

772
00:50:27.417 --> 00:50:31.158
This here,
this ain’t sitting right with me.


773
00:50:31.681 --> 00:50:35.177
I don't think I'm going to be making
this here trip.


774
00:50:35.888 --> 00:50:38.867
Yes, what she really wants to know is,

775
00:50:39.187 --> 00:50:42.001
are y’all going to kill her
when she gets to Memphis?


776
00:50:42.796 --> 00:50:46.109
The killing of Sister Martha
would not be helping our agenda.


777
00:50:46.401 --> 00:50:50.292
Besides, nobody cares
if she’s alive or dead.


778
00:50:50.429 --> 00:50:51.587
On the other hand,

779
00:50:52.038 --> 00:50:55.549
if you or some of the information
that Miss Martha has


780
00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:59.987
goes out and about
and makes itself known.


781
00:51:00.217 --> 00:51:02.260
You don't have to worry about that.

782
00:51:02.744 --> 00:51:08.071
Well, since I don't have to fly out,
what's your plans for me?


783
00:51:08.401 --> 00:51:10.852
You will meet me at the airport,

784
00:51:11.088 --> 00:51:15.041
carrying one of the five weapons
needed in Tennessee.


785
00:51:25.445 --> 00:51:29.083
Why is every page in here blank?

786
00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:38.377
Great, great job Miss Carol.

787
00:51:39.036 --> 00:51:40.947
There go your loose ends.

788
00:51:44.754 --> 00:51:47.991
Every now and again,
you see a man down


789
00:51:48.862 --> 00:51:50.810
and we refuse to help that man

790
00:51:51.187 --> 00:51:53.742
because we’re too busy
worried about where we're going


791
00:51:53.878 --> 00:51:57.154
and what might happen to us
if we do stop and help him.


792
00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:00.542
How come we never become
this good Samaritan


793
00:52:01.191 --> 00:52:02.589
and ask ourselves

794
00:52:04.307 --> 00:52:07.478
what would happen
if we don’t help that man,


795
00:52:09.497 --> 00:52:15.300
that woman, that child,
those sanitation workers,


796
00:52:18.358 --> 00:52:21.408
what would happen to them
if we don't help?


797
00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:30.151
We’re going to end up
on the wrong side of history for this.


798
00:52:30.763 --> 00:52:33.427
It depends on who's history
you’re talking about.


799
00:52:35.709 --> 00:52:38.377
What happened the last time
King came to Memphis?


800
00:52:39.064 --> 00:52:43.140
The last time he was in Memphis
the protest unknowingly became violent.


801
00:52:43.285 --> 00:52:47.544
Let's not forget two of your co-workers
were crushed inside their own trunks.


802
00:52:48.222 --> 00:52:49.765
What did we promise him?

803
00:52:50.227 --> 00:52:52.603
We promised them
a none violent protest.


804
00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:54.612
Look, that shit broke out.

805
00:52:54.815 --> 00:52:58.114
Things got out of hand
but we did not cause it.


806
00:52:58.711 --> 00:53:02.683
In Charlotte, I seen some familiar faces.

807
00:53:03.605 --> 00:53:05.483
You saw them
because she has some of the people


808
00:53:05.563 --> 00:53:07.480
that work right alongside of us.

809
00:53:07.685 --> 00:53:11.083
Malik, people are frustrated.

810
00:53:11.704 --> 00:53:15.309
Blacks and whites are frustrated.

811
00:53:15.747 --> 00:53:19.196
You have a white man standing
next to a black man, that he can't--


812
00:53:19.281 --> 00:53:21.220
They both hate Dr. King.

813
00:53:22.961 --> 00:53:24.848
How the hell did we get here?

814
00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:28.307
You paid some of the same blacks
that were out there


815
00:53:28.401 --> 00:53:31.441
to hold up the sign that said,
"stay away."


816
00:53:31.916 --> 00:53:33.700
I'm being paid to do a job.

817
00:53:33.822 --> 00:53:37.027
You’re selling your soul
every which way you turn.


818
00:53:38.923 --> 00:53:45.375
So it's my fault that we as blacks
are not on the same page?


819
00:53:45.888 --> 00:53:48.485
Shit, you’re not even
in the same fucking book.


820
00:53:49.281 --> 00:53:52.542
Planting people to incite riots
isn’t anything new.


821
00:53:55.389 --> 00:53:57.248
This is a different type of seed.

822
00:53:57.954 --> 00:54:04.777
Dr. King has burned bridge after bridge,
after fucking bridge.


823
00:54:05.314 --> 00:54:06.852
That doesn’t mean we have to warm

824
00:54:06.951 --> 00:54:09.681
our fucking hands off
of the fucking burning bridge.


825
00:54:10.871 --> 00:54:12.514
When do we push back?

826
00:54:13.304 --> 00:54:15.083
When do we fight back?

827
00:54:15.417 --> 00:54:21.102
When do we say, no, I cannot help you
take down another black man.


828
00:54:21.921 --> 00:54:24.151
You tell their asses no.

829
00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:27.751
Fuck that. Let their asses
do their own damn devil work.


830
00:54:28.575 --> 00:54:31.215
You sound like
you’re afraid to move forward.


831
00:54:31.474 --> 00:54:32.655
You sound like--

832
00:54:32.749 --> 00:54:33.855
You sold them out.

833
00:54:37.732 --> 00:54:41.427
They’re expecting 1,300
to come out here and protest


834
00:54:42.264 --> 00:54:45.572
and they’re going to be.

835
00:54:48.344 --> 00:54:50.175
You’re talking just to be talking.

836
00:54:51.831 --> 00:54:54.551
Where the fuck you and your family
going to run to?


837
00:54:54.716 --> 00:54:58.010
Your fucking mother is stretched out
in the living room on her oxygen.


838
00:54:58.217 --> 00:54:59.780
What the fuck y’all want?

839
00:55:00.024 --> 00:55:01.911
You don’t even have
to go out there for them.


840
00:55:02.038 --> 00:55:03.911
Let’s get this shit straight.

841
00:55:04.636 --> 00:55:08.730
You both are just expendable assets
on a payroll.


842
00:55:09.205 --> 00:55:13.916
It just so happened, it worked out perfect,
that you both are sanitation workers.


843
00:55:14.071 --> 00:55:18.401
I’m just sick to know
that y’all pulled it to be


844
00:55:18.551 --> 00:55:21.940
for you, your co-workers, and Dr. King.

845
00:55:22.109 --> 00:55:24.123
You’re not going to
leave us out to dry.

846
00:55:24.255 --> 00:55:25.850
We’re all being used.

847
00:55:26.551 --> 00:55:29.568
The people who have chosen
their position on Dr. King's views


848
00:55:29.728 --> 00:55:32.132
and they dug themselves in

849
00:55:32.358 --> 00:55:36.914
therefore trust that
Dr. King him is no longer.


850
00:55:38.801 --> 00:55:42.655
So in a small, small way,
we are all contributing


851
00:55:42.754 --> 00:55:43.996
to this misdeed

852
00:55:44.123 --> 00:55:47.328
and this misdeed is going to affect man
for years to come.


853
00:55:48.518 --> 00:55:53.521
That man is at that motel,
surrounded by who he's surrounded by.


854
00:55:56.688 --> 00:56:00.071
I just hope he’s praying to a known God
about his unknown future.


855
00:56:01.492 --> 00:56:08.631
We just got to get past this dream,
this fantasy of a united front.


856
00:56:10.678 --> 00:56:13.845
Too many of us has
the other side.


857
00:56:13.982 --> 00:56:19.591
A side that never wants to see
unity amongst us as a race.


858
00:56:21.083 --> 00:56:23.601
I wonder how
reverend Willy sleeps at night


859
00:56:24.702 --> 00:56:26.589
because I know I won’t be able to.

860
00:56:26.848 --> 00:56:30.048
There's a certain level of hypocrisy
in America


861
00:56:30.377 --> 00:56:32.231
that soon will be exposed.

862
00:56:32.942 --> 00:56:35.572
If the two of you
remember anything,


863
00:56:35.855 --> 00:56:41.521
remember that one day your usefulness
will no longer be needed.


864
00:56:58.269 --> 00:57:01.370
Is that the junior G man?

865
00:57:01.643 --> 00:57:03.050
Do you personally know of anyone

866
00:57:03.154 --> 00:57:05.991
who wanted to hurt or contributed
to the killing of Dr. King?


867
00:57:06.137 --> 00:57:07.747
Personally, no.

868
00:57:07.963 --> 00:57:10.123
Did you have a dislike for Dr. King?

869
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:12.500
No. Dr. King and I are friends.

870
00:57:13.116 --> 00:57:15.845
Do you have a personal vendetta
or agenda


871
00:57:15.958 --> 00:57:17.412
against Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.?

872
00:57:17.497 --> 00:57:18.989
Nothing?

873
00:57:19.267 --> 00:57:21.417
Dr. King and I are friends.

874
00:57:21.958 --> 00:57:25.074
We go back to childhood days
playing in the sandbox together.


875
00:57:25.248 --> 00:57:27.069
We used to walk to school together.

876
00:57:27.252 --> 00:57:29.069
That man took me to church.

877
00:57:29.431 --> 00:57:33.309
As a matter of fact, he gave me
a personal relationship with God.


878
00:57:33.615 --> 00:57:36.340
There is no amount of money in the world
that you can offer me


879
00:57:36.547 --> 00:57:37.916
to get me to betray him.

880
00:57:39.069 --> 00:57:41.238
Who mentioned anything about betrayal?

881
00:57:41.747 --> 00:57:43.634
Look, I don’t have an
ounce of hate in me.

882
00:57:44.321 --> 00:57:46.471
Reverend King did what he had to do.

883
00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:49.177
Why I feel you have
no problem with him being dead.


884
00:57:49.276 --> 00:57:51.177
Don’t project your feelings out on me.

885
00:57:51.775 --> 00:57:54.612
How we start with someone
is not usually how we end up with them.


886
00:57:54.772 --> 00:57:57.332
We did some great things
with the movement


887
00:57:57.450 --> 00:57:58.763
and we lost a great man.

888
00:57:58.843 --> 00:58:00.241
A great, great man.

889
00:58:00.377 --> 00:58:03.229
A man who helped pushed you
into something that you helped create.


890
00:58:03.332 --> 00:58:05.742
All because of your sexual preferences
at that.


891
00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:08.820
Martin was under a lot of pressure
from a lot of black leaders--


892
00:58:08.923 --> 00:58:11.488
Who felt that a gay man shouldn’t--

893
00:58:12.697 --> 00:58:14.768
Doesn’t that make you angry?

894
00:58:15.554 --> 00:58:20.015
Yes, it makes me very angry
but this is not about me.


895
00:58:20.325 --> 00:58:23.911
What you need to do is go out there
and find who killed Martin.


896
00:58:24.114 --> 00:58:27.314
Why are you not using your resources
to find out


897
00:58:27.431 --> 00:58:29.789
who financed the man
who killed my friend?


898
00:58:31.215 --> 00:58:32.561
Your friend.

899
00:58:33.441 --> 00:58:35.874
Yes, he was my friend.

900
00:58:36.038 --> 00:58:37.445
Are you sure about that?

901
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:40.518
Because I surely heard different
with my own two ears.


902
00:58:40.641 --> 00:58:44.683
I’ve heard some audio about you,
this Russ guy and a client


903
00:58:44.829 --> 00:58:47.140
meeting up with the now missing
Agent Fisher.


904
00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:51.558
Am I here so that I can give you
valuable information


905
00:58:51.662 --> 00:58:57.624
on the last days of Dr. King
or is it because of your missing colleague?


906
00:58:58.081 --> 00:59:00.165
Now if it’s the latter,

907
00:59:00.523 --> 00:59:04.123
then I don’t know
what it is that you are talking about.


908
00:59:04.325 --> 00:59:07.610
Yes, the fuck you do know
what the fuck it is I’m talking about.


909
00:59:07.817 --> 00:59:10.434
Because I’ve heard audio
of Dr. King himself


910
00:59:10.735 --> 00:59:14.561
talking about how you yourself
have set up meetings for him


911
00:59:14.796 --> 00:59:16.300
and it does not
look good for you, lady.

912
00:59:16.396 --> 00:59:18.405
Did you bring me here to be interviewed

913
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:23.718
or to be discredited for some bullshit
that you are going to be resenting later?


914
00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:27.652
Now, I’m curious as to why

915
00:59:27.714 --> 00:59:30.975
these accusations
with audios that you’ve heard


916
00:59:31.210 --> 00:59:33.064
have anything to do

917
00:59:33.281 --> 00:59:37.017
with finding the real killers
that murdered Marting Luther King Jr?


918
00:59:40.547 --> 00:59:43.041
I don’t think you know
what you think you know.


919
00:59:44.608 --> 00:59:46.857
You cannot make me change my story.

920
00:59:46.961 --> 00:59:48.909
I am telling you the truth.

921
00:59:49.168 --> 00:59:52.598
I heard that gunshot
right above my head and I looked up.


922
00:59:54.387 --> 00:59:59.074
I saw the gun powder or something
come right out of that rifle.


923
01:00:00.481 --> 01:00:05.634
I saw that white hand pull that rifle
right back into the window.


924
01:00:05.944 --> 01:00:08.081
No, that gunshot came
from somewhere else.


925
01:00:08.194 --> 01:00:10.772
What you heard was the sound
bouncing off the buildings.


926
01:00:11.332 --> 01:00:12.594
No, it didn't.

927
01:00:13.751 --> 01:00:16.085
That shot came from the firehouse.

928
01:00:16.857 --> 01:00:19.220
Them men that was standing there
looked right at me


929
01:00:19.304 --> 01:00:23.427
and I got a good look at them too,
before I put my head down and walked off.


930
01:00:23.869 --> 01:00:28.504
I pass by that firehouse every day
on my way to work


931
01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:30.561
where Dr. King was killed.

932
01:00:31.408 --> 01:00:35.234
I strongly suggest you
rethink what you're saying right now


933
01:00:35.874 --> 01:00:38.575
and rethink it
as though your life depends on it.


934
01:00:38.947 --> 01:00:41.704
Sir, there is nothing to rethink.

935
01:00:42.904 --> 01:00:46.382
I heard those gunshots and we owe--

936
01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:48.885
I don't owe shit

937
01:00:49.276 --> 01:00:52.274
but you still owe the county 90 days
for what Mr. Bailey said


938
01:00:52.372 --> 01:00:54.052
that you stole from the motel.

939
01:00:55.450 --> 01:00:58.645
Now, sadly,
Mrs. Bailey passed of a heart attack


940
01:00:58.772 --> 01:01:00.810
a few hours after King got shot

941
01:01:02.796 --> 01:01:06.452
so the only Bailey that didn't want
to see you locked up is gone.


942
01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:11.017
I'm sorry about Mrs. Bailey.

943
01:01:11.742 --> 01:01:13.554
God bless her soul.

944
01:01:15.201 --> 01:01:18.937
I could never bring myself
to steal from them.


945
01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:24.556
They gave me
next to nothing.


946
01:01:24.989 --> 01:01:28.255
We know that he found you
on the streets in the gutter,


947
01:01:28.838 --> 01:01:32.340
brought you in and you mean to tell me
you couldn't have done better by him?


948
01:01:33.497 --> 01:01:37.163
And I know you devils killed him
in that there hospital.


949
01:01:37.732 --> 01:01:40.660
Y'all took your shot, y'all got him down

950
01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.015
and there was no way

951
01:01:42.114 --> 01:01:44.443
y'all was going to let him
leave that hospital alive.


952
01:01:44.688 --> 01:01:46.274
You don't know shit.

953
01:01:46.462 --> 01:01:50.754
What I do know is
you bastards set him up

954
01:01:50.932 --> 01:01:52.975
and then you motherfuckers killed him.

955
01:01:53.121 --> 01:01:54.914
Ain't no other story to tell.

956
01:01:55.563 --> 01:01:56.937
Now, what's your name?

957
01:01:58.542 --> 01:01:59.742
Patterson?

958
01:01:59.944 --> 01:02:04.001
I personally know that, if I was you,
I would watch what it is that I was saying.


959
01:02:04.085 --> 01:02:06.909
But you're not me
and what you going to do?


960
01:02:07.064 --> 01:02:08.307
Kill me too?

961
01:02:09.756 --> 01:02:12.692
Nigga, you ain't worth the request.

962
01:02:13.243 --> 01:02:16.038
You're going to watch
how you speak to me.


963
01:02:16.175 --> 01:02:19.300
No, I fucking won't
because Fisher's still fucking missing


964
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:21.601
and two of his assets are missing.

965
01:02:21.812 --> 01:02:23.238
He knew the risk.

966
01:02:23.361 --> 01:02:25.784
He took the assignment.

967
01:02:26.274 --> 01:02:30.791
You better tie up all them loose ends
because, when this shit rolls back--


968
01:02:31.629 --> 01:02:34.551
The four men got Earl is in custody

969
01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:37.949
and you're still worried
about what's under your fingernails.


970
01:02:38.288 --> 01:02:41.163
I've washed my hands with this, Coleman.

971
01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:44.001
By the time thet
put all of this together,

972
01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:46.810
you might be dead, 
I might be dead,

973
01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.718
or I might just be an old lady
sitting on the porch


974
01:02:49.827 --> 01:02:53.069
listening to my great-grandchildren
talk about school


975
01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:56.782
or what the real enemy
is teaching them on American history.


976
01:02:58.217 --> 01:03:02.589
We only know
what we're taught and told, right?


977
01:03:19.869 --> 01:03:21.770
Freedom, spread out across my chest

978
01:03:21.850 --> 01:03:24.057
and, if I die,
then I pray it's my cause of death.


979
01:03:24.142 --> 01:03:26.387
Baby, my freedom worth
more than you'll ever know,


980
01:03:26.471 --> 01:03:28.631
And if they're trying to take it
from me, I'm ready to go.


981
01:03:28.711 --> 01:03:31.036
Baby, my freedom worth
hundreds of shots.


982
01:03:31.121 --> 01:03:33.394
Before I give in,
know it's coming with you in a box.


983
01:03:33.478 --> 01:03:35.591
Know my freedom ain't one you could buy.

984
01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.005
Just know my freedom got me here
'til the day that I die.


985
01:03:38.090 --> 01:03:39.121
It's freedom or us.

986
01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:40.288
We ready to die.

987
01:03:40.372 --> 01:03:42.565
We lived in the shit,
you fed us the lie,


988
01:03:42.655 --> 01:03:44.942
You put us in dirt,
we reached for the sky.


989
01:03:45.027 --> 01:03:47.248
You needed a way,
we gave you the guy.

990
01:03:47.332 --> 01:03:49.530
Packed a million on a bus,
this freedom gonna ride.


991
01:03:49.605 --> 01:03:51.850
You can try to keep us down
but this freedom gonna ride.


992
01:03:51.925 --> 01:03:54.161
Black hand in the air,
that's how our freedom


993
01:03:57.394 --> 01:03:58.763
Know that our freedom is high.

994
01:03:58.848 --> 01:03:59.907
Baby girl, hand me the joint.

995
01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:01.125
Time to get high.

996
01:04:03.427 --> 01:04:05.643
'Cause everybody on this planet
know freedom is ours,


997
01:04:05.723 --> 01:04:07.958
And every moment we deny
that's fuel for the fire,


998
01:04:08.029 --> 01:04:10.269
So, when you look me in my eyes,
you see it inside.


999
01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:12.636
Asking me what are my thoughts?
I only got freedom in mind.


1000
01:04:12.711 --> 01:04:15.177
Hand me the keys to cage,
I'm going to put freedom inside.


1001
01:04:15.328 --> 01:04:17.314
Freedom spread out across my chest,

1002
01:04:17.398 --> 01:04:19.525
And, if I die,
then I pray it's my cause of death.


1003
01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:21.601
Baby, my freedom worth
more than you'll ever know,


1004
01:04:21.671 --> 01:04:23.902
And, if they try to take it from me,
I'm ready to go.


1005
01:04:23.972 --> 01:04:26.420
Baby, my freedom
worth hundreds of shots.


1006
01:04:26.518 --> 01:04:28.627
Before I give in, know it's coming
with you in a box.


1007
01:04:28.678 --> 01:04:30.867
Know my freedom ain't one you can buy.

1008
01:04:31.041 --> 01:04:33.295
Just know my freedom got me here
'til the day that I die.


1009
01:04:33.398 --> 01:04:35.450
Go ahead and spray us
with the hose if you want.


1010
01:04:35.535 --> 01:04:37.676
You going to turn our freedom
to a fight from a stunt.


1011
01:04:37.855 --> 01:04:40.095
You going to make a panther
turn his pride into a pump.


1012
01:04:40.198 --> 01:04:42.368
You can make five little minutes
to a month.


1013
01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:44.575
We going to get a president
to do it how we want.


1014
01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:46.980
They saying, "How high?"
before we even say, "Jump."


1015
01:04:47.055 --> 01:04:49.257
Put us in a cage
and we'll put you in a trunk.


1016
01:04:49.347 --> 01:04:51.572
You can kill us by the two's
but I promise we the one.


1017
01:04:51.643 --> 01:04:53.841
'Cause you funds.

1018
01:04:53.925 --> 01:04:56.184
We going to get it out the hood,
by the tons.


1019
01:04:56.283 --> 01:04:58.551
Pull your shirt down
'cause you're and got to run.


1020
01:04:58.636 --> 01:05:00.862
America the

1021
01:05:00.947 --> 01:05:03.031
Through the social ladder,
we the bottom of the run,


1022
01:05:03.116 --> 01:05:05.469
But I promise when it's done,
it's African and drums.


1023
01:05:05.544 --> 01:05:07.803
Keep us
we'll control it with our thumbs.


1024
01:05:07.874 --> 01:05:10.250
Show up in our passages
how it comes.


1025
01:05:10.391 --> 01:05:14.692
No, when it's justice denied,
then it's no justice at all.


1026
01:05:14.834 --> 01:05:15.690
Justice.

1027
01:05:15.784 --> 01:05:17.874
Being denied today
is being denied too long.


1028
01:05:17.949 --> 01:05:21.389
You can't tuck us away in the breeze
and pray for our


1029
01:05:21.483 --> 01:05:22.551
The moon is our light.

1030
01:05:22.627 --> 01:05:25.088
The night is ours
and yours is to come.

1031
01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.130
Freedom fight.
Fight for freedom.


1032
01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:29.681
Freedom fighting
cause fighting is our freedom.


1033
01:05:29.798 --> 01:05:31.478
Freedom fight, fight for freedom.

1034
01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.234
They can't stop us.
You know why?


1035
01:05:33.323 --> 01:05:35.356
Freedom can't be denied

1036
01:05:35.427 --> 01:05:37.803
and, as long as we have lungs,
we have a duty.


1037
01:05:37.883 --> 01:05:40.321
A duty to get free and stay free.

1038
01:05:40.415 --> 01:05:42.716
A duty to get free and stay free.

1039
01:05:42.796 --> 01:05:45.558
A duty to get free and stay free.

1040
01:05:45.634 --> 01:05:47.620
A duty.

1041
01:05:47.728 --> 01:05:49.394
Freedom spread out across my chest,

1042
01:05:49.488 --> 01:05:51.925
And if I die,
then I pray it's my cause of death.


1043
01:05:52.029 --> 01:05:54.245
Freedom worth more
than you'll ever know,


1044
01:05:54.335 --> 01:05:55.474
And if they try to take
