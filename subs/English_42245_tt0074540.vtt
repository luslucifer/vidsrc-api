1
00:01:32.872 --> 00:01:33.988
Hit it, hit it!

2
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.993
Way to go.

3
00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:44.078
I'm trying here.

4
00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:46.568
Way to go, Jay Parks!

5
00:01:55.842 --> 00:01:57.301
Okay, let's go.

6
00:01:57.302 --> 00:02:01.809
Forward eye.

7
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.612
Right.
On one, on one. Ready?


8
00:02:07.735 --> 00:02:08.722
Six.

9
00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:11.213
Six.

10
00:02:11.728 --> 00:02:12.974
Two.

11
00:02:14.262 --> 00:02:16.751
Six. Three. Four.

12
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:40.966
My name is Morgan.
I play football.


13
00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:44.444
We worked our butts off trying to get
it together for the big Sunday game.


14
00:02:44.445 --> 00:02:47.793
So the coach told us to knock it off,
and relax for a few days.


15
00:02:47.794 --> 00:02:49.810
One of my teammates, Davis,

16
00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:51.699
came up with the idea that
we head out to the island.


17
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.190
He went ahead to
make the arrangements.


18
00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:56.123
I talked our PR man, Brian,
into coming along.


19
00:02:56.124 --> 00:02:59.557
I felt the day off
would do him some good, too.


20
00:02:59.558 --> 00:03:01.060
It'll be great to be
in the country again,


21
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:02.391
and enjoy some
of the open spaces


22
00:03:02.392 --> 00:03:05.396
that man hasn't screwed up
with his technology.


23
00:03:05.397 --> 00:03:07.586
My father used to say, "Morgan,

24
00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:09.088
"one of these days
the earth will get even


25
00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:11.709
"with man for messing her up
with his garbage.


26
00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:13.726
"Just let man
continue to pollute the earth


27
00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:16.216
"the way he is,
and nature will rebel.


28
00:03:16.217 --> 00:03:19.307
"And it's going to be
one hell of a rebellion."


29
00:03:19.308 --> 00:03:21.283
Of course,
I never took him seriously,


30
00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.816
but I still remember the way
he looked at me when he said,


31
00:03:23.817 --> 00:03:26.006
"You'll never know when and
where it's going to happen.


32
00:03:26.521 --> 00:03:30.041
"And once it starts, you'll never
know how and when it'll stop."


33
00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:32.059
It's funny how my father's
prediction comes to mind


34
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.550
when I go to the country,
like today.


35
00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:15.663
Venison tonight, right?

36
00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:17.165
.We haven't got him yet

37
00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:18.154
We will.

38
00:05:18.668 --> 00:05:20.171
They've got it!

39
00:05:33.739 --> 00:05:34.727
Go on, beat it.

40
00:05:36.573 --> 00:05:37.990
Hey, what'd you do that for?

41
00:05:38.462 --> 00:05:41.767
Come on, Davis. We won. The poor
bastard lost. What more do you want?


42
00:05:41.768 --> 00:05:42.627
Get out of here.

43
00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:44.645
Hey, come on, let him go.

44
00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:20.562
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!


45
00:07:59.376 --> 00:08:00.449
Jesus.

46
00:08:15.948 --> 00:08:17.237
Oh, my God.

47
00:08:24.192 --> 00:08:27.198
You stay with him, Brian,
I'll be right back, okay?


48
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.293
Hello.

49
00:09:13.654 --> 00:09:15.157
Hello?

50
00:09:17.646 --> 00:09:19.150
Hello.

51
00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:36.796
Hello?

52
00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:11.211
Where the hell did you get
those goddamn chickens?


53
00:11:11.683 --> 00:11:14.688
Hey, do you know those
bastards almost killed me, huh?


54
00:11:19.583 --> 00:11:21.558
You had no business in there.

55
00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:23.532
Look, my name is Morgan.
I need a telephone.


56
00:11:23.533 --> 00:11:25.036
There's been a bad accident
in the woods out there.


57
00:11:25.037 --> 00:11:25.980
My friend is dead.

58
00:11:25.981 --> 00:11:27.612
We don't have no phone.

59
00:11:27.613 --> 00:11:28.985
Well, where can I find one?

60
00:11:28.986 --> 00:11:30.316
None nearby, you can't.

61
00:11:30.317 --> 00:11:32.292
We're the only farm
on this end of the island.


62
00:11:32.678 --> 00:11:34.180
What? No one else?

63
00:11:34.181 --> 00:11:37.658
That horse, did you get it from
the stable near the ferry landing?


64
00:11:37.659 --> 00:11:39.061
Yes, I did.

65
00:11:39.062 --> 00:11:42.166
Well, when you take it back,
they got a phone.


66
00:11:42.167 --> 00:11:44.287
Thanks a lot. By the time I get
there I won't need one.


67
00:11:44.572 --> 00:11:46.846
Please, mister...

68
00:11:46.847 --> 00:11:48.068
Could you take a
look at something that


69
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.567
scared the wits out of me?

70
00:11:50.568 --> 00:11:52.643
Hey, look, lady, I've already
seen your chickens.


71
00:11:52.644 --> 00:11:55.090
No.
No, this is something else.


72
00:11:55.091 --> 00:11:57.580
I wouldn't ask
if Mr. Skinner was here.


73
00:11:57.581 --> 00:12:00.070
The Lord knows I wouldn't.

74
00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:02.947
But I'm frightened
they've got to it.


75
00:12:02.948 --> 00:12:04.278
What do you mean, "they"?

76
00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:06.768
Please, mister,
will you take a quick look,


77
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:09.773
and tell me if you think,
it's what I think it is?


78
00:12:09.774 --> 00:12:10.805
Please.

79
00:12:23.299 --> 00:12:24.802
Look.

80
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.022
Do those look
like ratholes to you?


81
00:12:28.452 --> 00:12:29.953
Yeah, they sure do.

82
00:12:29.954 --> 00:12:31.457
I knew it.
They got at the food.


83
00:12:31.929 --> 00:12:33.432
They must've.

84
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.553
Is this what you've been
feeding those chickens?


85
00:12:37.554 --> 00:12:41.761
No. This is the way
it comes to us from the Lord.


86
00:12:41.762 --> 00:12:43.265
The chickens
won't touch none of it,


87
00:12:43.736 --> 00:12:46.655
unless we mix it with
the meal and the bran.


88
00:12:46.656 --> 00:12:49.146
Yeah, well, that wasp seems to
like it well enough.


89
00:12:49.147 --> 00:12:50.563
I mean, what is it?

90
00:12:50.564 --> 00:12:53.568
The good Lord give it to us
'cause we're deserving people.


91
00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:56.230
And we pray regularly, we do.

92
00:12:56.746 --> 00:12:58.067
And the Lord is
going to see to it


93
00:12:58.206 --> 00:13:00.223
that we don't need
money no more. Never.


94
00:13:00.224 --> 00:13:01.941
Look, lady,
I don't think you realize


95
00:13:01.942 --> 00:13:03.788
how dangerous this
stuff could really be.


96
00:13:04.259 --> 00:13:06.276
Mr. Skinner's in
the city this minute,


97
00:13:06.277 --> 00:13:09.582
making a big, important
money deal for this food.


98
00:13:09.583 --> 00:13:11.085
That's what he's doing,
right now,


99
00:13:11.086 --> 00:13:14.091
at the same time
we're standing here talking.


100
00:13:14.092 --> 00:13:15.394
Yeah, but that's not
gonna help very much


101
00:13:15.395 --> 00:13:17.612
if something besides those
chickens have gotten into this food.


102
00:13:17.613 --> 00:13:20.617
Well, nothing on our farm
killed your friend,


103
00:13:20.618 --> 00:13:22.077
if that's what you're thinking.

104
00:13:22.078 --> 00:13:24.095
Lady, how large do you think
those rats will grow


105
00:13:24.096 --> 00:13:25.469
if they've gotten into
this food of yours, huh?


106
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:26.973
Mr. Skinner'll know
what to do,


107
00:13:27.445 --> 00:13:29.462
no matter what ate it up.

108
00:13:29.463 --> 00:13:31.867
He'll know exactly what to do.

109
00:13:31.868 --> 00:13:34.873
Yeah, well, I hope so,
because I'll be coming back.


110
00:14:26.481 --> 00:14:28.971
I didn't think
we'd be going back like this.


111
00:14:30.001 --> 00:14:30.989
Yeah.

112
00:14:36.485 --> 00:14:38.503
What do we do now?

113
00:14:39.747 --> 00:14:42.453
I guess we let
the coroner figure it out.


114
00:14:43.955 --> 00:14:46.188
We gotta tell him
what we think, don't we?


115
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:47.218
No, I don't think so.

116
00:14:47.691 --> 00:14:48.920
I mean, we'd sound like
a couple of prize idiots


117
00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:49.952
telling the District Attorney

118
00:14:49.953 --> 00:14:52.843
a giant something or other
killed our buddy, wouldn't we?


119
00:14:54.346 --> 00:14:56.578
How many times you been
busted up playing pro ball?


120
00:14:57.094 --> 00:14:58.080
I don't know.

121
00:14:58.081 --> 00:14:59.584
I don't think
there's a guy in the league


122
00:14:59.585 --> 00:15:02.116
who hasn't been
laid out once or twice.


123
00:15:02.117 --> 00:15:03.405
Except Davis.

124
00:15:05.208 --> 00:15:08.556
Been playing with the team
for seven years.


125
00:15:08.557 --> 00:15:10.962
Never even been
carried off the field.


126
00:15:11.992 --> 00:15:13.409
Yeah, so what's the point?

127
00:15:13.881 --> 00:15:15.898
So, what I want to know is,
how does a guy with all that luck


128
00:15:15.899 --> 00:15:17.917
have this happen to him?

129
00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:22.812
Well, I guess his luck ran out.

130
00:17:10.065 --> 00:17:12.083
Oh, excuse me, sir.

131
00:17:13.156 --> 00:17:14.658
Yes?

132
00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:16.676
Anything happen today, sir?

133
00:17:16.677 --> 00:17:18.650
Happen?

134
00:17:18.651 --> 00:17:20.282
Like, unusual.

135
00:17:20.283 --> 00:17:24.275
Well, a man was killed stag
hunting on one of the islands.


136
00:17:24.276 --> 00:17:26.293
Fell off his horse.

137
00:17:26.294 --> 00:17:27.625
You mean, unusual like that?

138
00:17:28.098 --> 00:17:29.085
Not exactly.

139
00:17:30.587 --> 00:17:32.604
I saw the body.

140
00:17:32.605 --> 00:17:34.580
His two friends
brought him across.


141
00:17:34.581 --> 00:17:37.586
He was all swollen and ugly.

142
00:17:37.587 --> 00:17:39.089
You know what I mean?

143
00:17:41.107 --> 00:17:44.111
I don't suppose
his friends said anything


144
00:17:44.112 --> 00:17:47.203
about seeing some
big things, did they?


145
00:17:47.204 --> 00:17:49.179
Anything of that sort, sir?

146
00:19:26.084 --> 00:19:27.071
God!

147
00:19:35.659 --> 00:19:37.117
Oh, God!

148
00:21:44.593 --> 00:21:46.354
Who's there?

149
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.759
Lord, save me, save me.

150
00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:23.945
I just came from
the coroner's office.


151
00:23:23.946 --> 00:23:25.448
Yeah, what'd he say?

152
00:23:25.449 --> 00:23:27.466
From the amount of
poison in his body,


153
00:23:27.467 --> 00:23:32.447
he estimates that Davis was stung
by no less than 250 wasps.


154
00:23:32.962 --> 00:23:33.950
Jesus.

155
00:23:36.483 --> 00:23:37.984
Come on, let's go.
Where to?


156
00:23:37.985 --> 00:23:39.187
The farm.

157
00:23:39.188 --> 00:23:40.475
Come on, what do you want
to go out there for?


158
00:23:40.476 --> 00:23:41.978
The ride.

159
00:23:41.979 --> 00:23:43.480
Well, I'd like to
go along with you,


160
00:23:43.481 --> 00:23:45.498
but I'm splitting for
Chicago tonight, remember?


161
00:23:45.499 --> 00:23:46.499
Come on, Brian, will you?

162
00:23:47.002 --> 00:23:49.491
Hey, baby, if I don't set up
that promotion in Chicago,


163
00:23:49.492 --> 00:23:51.982
you jocks ain't gonna have too many
fans watching you play football.


164
00:23:51.983 --> 00:23:53.185
Come on, you know darn well

165
00:23:53.186 --> 00:23:56.447
you don't have to be there
for at least two days.


166
00:23:56.448 --> 00:23:58.937
Well, all right.

167
00:23:58.938 --> 00:24:02.044
If the truth were known,
I'm really not all that ecstatic


168
00:24:02.059 --> 00:24:04.949
about going out there
with you, Morgan, you know.


169
00:24:33.845 --> 00:24:37.365
Oh, Tom, come on.
Please hurry.


170
00:24:38.868 --> 00:24:40.886
Tom, get it going.

171
00:24:41.359 --> 00:24:42.389
Oh!

172
00:24:42.861 --> 00:24:44.707
Oh, please stop.
Please.


173
00:24:49.731 --> 00:24:52.737
Please, please stop!

174
00:24:54.583 --> 00:24:56.084
Why didn't you stop?

175
00:24:56.085 --> 00:24:57.071
What for?

176
00:24:57.072 --> 00:24:59.089
The girl was pregnant.

177
00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.078
So?

178
00:25:00.079 --> 00:25:01.580
So she wanted something, Jack.

179
00:25:01.581 --> 00:25:03.083
Maybe they were in trouble.

180
00:25:03.084 --> 00:25:05.744
lt can wait.
We'll pick them up on the way back


181
00:25:05.745 --> 00:25:08.407
You don't care about anybody
but yourself, do you?


182
00:25:08.408 --> 00:25:10.510
Is that what you think of me?

183
00:25:10.511 --> 00:25:13.172
I think you're
the most selfish man I know.


184
00:25:13.173 --> 00:25:14.675
So why do you work for me?

185
00:25:14.676 --> 00:25:16.608
Because jobs for
female bacteriologists


186
00:25:16.609 --> 00:25:18.539
are just not that
easy to find, Jack.


187
00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.085
So who told you to be one?

188
00:25:20.086 --> 00:25:22.575
You're a bastard,
did you know that?


189
00:25:22.576 --> 00:25:24.594
As a matter of fact, I do.

190
00:25:36.573 --> 00:25:39.105
Oh, Tom,
I don't know what we're gonna do.


191
00:25:39.106 --> 00:25:40.093
.Just stay calm

192
00:25:40.094 --> 00:25:42.584
Don't worry about
a thing, sweetheart.


193
00:25:44.602 --> 00:25:47.093
Who put this goddamn gate here?

194
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:39.688
Hey, what's that?

195
00:26:48.876 --> 00:26:50.937
Oh, my God!

196
00:26:50.938 --> 00:26:52.784
What do you suppose killed them?

197
00:26:53.298 --> 00:26:57.935
Well, whatever it was, it did
a good job on the barn doors.


198
00:26:57.936 --> 00:26:59.909
I'm really impressed, Jack
. How about you?


199
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.443
Well, I don't know. You can't
tell much when they're dead.


200
00:27:02.444 --> 00:27:04.118
How do we know some clown
didn't make this thing


201
00:27:04.119 --> 00:27:06.952
out of plaster of Paris and
a handful of ostrich feathers?


202
00:27:08.455 --> 00:27:10.730
Let's see if we can
find Ma and Pa Kettle.


203
00:27:30.695 --> 00:27:32.026
I don't see anybody.

204
00:27:36.535 --> 00:27:37.565
Mr. Skinner!

205
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:40.313
Hello!

206
00:27:40.785 --> 00:27:42.245
Anybody around?

207
00:27:45.379 --> 00:27:46.881
He said he'd be here.

208
00:27:46.882 --> 00:27:48.384
Well, maybe he's out back, huh?

209
00:27:48.385 --> 00:27:49.888
Yeah.

210
00:28:17.709 --> 00:28:19.727
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

211
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.701
I thought you was...

212
00:28:21.702 --> 00:28:24.235
Well, I don't know what...

213
00:28:24.236 --> 00:28:26.210
My heads all mixed up.

214
00:28:26.211 --> 00:28:29.216
It was them coming in.
Mr. Skinner said they would.


215
00:28:30.203 --> 00:28:32.737
What happened to your arm?

216
00:28:33.209 --> 00:28:37.845
It was the big worms, miss,
crawling horrible things.


217
00:28:37.846 --> 00:28:39.348
And then the rats came.

218
00:28:39.349 --> 00:28:40.379
Rats?

219
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:44.801
In the barn, awful giant rats.

220
00:28:44.802 --> 00:28:46.391
Well, we're looking for
Mr. Skinner.


221
00:28:46.905 --> 00:28:48.408
What do you want him for?

222
00:28:48.409 --> 00:28:50.897
Well, we were supposed
to meet him out here today.


223
00:28:50.898 --> 00:28:53.860
Mr. Skinner didn't
come home last night.


224
00:28:53.861 --> 00:28:55.534
Maybe he stayed
over in the city.


225
00:28:55.535 --> 00:28:59.370
Well, that doesn't matter. You can
show us whatever you have out here.


226
00:28:59.371 --> 00:29:02.992
But Mr. Skinner never stays
away overnight. Never.


227
00:29:02.993 --> 00:29:06.312
Are you trying to tell me I've
wasted my time coming out here?


228
00:29:06.313 --> 00:29:08.029
Did you make a money deal with him?

229
00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:10.863
No, not exactly.

230
00:29:10.864 --> 00:29:13.353
Then, I'm afraid I can't
show you our secret.


231
00:29:13.354 --> 00:29:14.685
It wouldn't be right.

232
00:29:14.686 --> 00:29:18.090
Look, I didn't travel all the way
out here to this goddamn hole


233
00:29:18.091 --> 00:29:20.181
to see some dead
chicken carcasses.


234
00:29:20.496 --> 00:29:23.486
Now, do you have something
you want to sell or haven't you?


235
00:29:23.487 --> 00:29:27.136
Hold it, Jack. Why don't you just try
being a little human for a change?


236
00:29:27.608 --> 00:29:29.626
Mrs. Skinner, we have
to get back to the city.


237
00:29:30.099 --> 00:29:32.300
Couldn't you show us what
your husband fed the chickens?


238
00:29:32.432 --> 00:29:36.495
I won't let Mr. Bensington take
advantage of you, I promise.


239
00:29:36.496 --> 00:29:38.470
All right, miss, 
I'll show you.

240
00:29:38.471 --> 00:29:40.574
I don't care what happens.

241
00:29:40.575 --> 00:29:43.108
I just want my husband
to be with me again.


242
00:30:10.028 --> 00:30:11.059
See?

243
00:30:13.378 --> 00:30:16.768
That's what your husband
brought us out here for?


244
00:30:16.769 --> 00:30:19.259
Just like Mr. Skinner
found it.


245
00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.233
Just like that one day.

246
00:30:21.234 --> 00:30:22.738
At first he thought it was oil,

247
00:30:23.252 --> 00:30:25.269
and it was gonna make us rich.

248
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:26.773
Come on, Lorna.

249
00:30:26.774 --> 00:30:29.262
But wait a minute, Jack,
wait a minute. Look at this.


250
00:30:29.263 --> 00:30:31.753
I've never seen
anything like it.


251
00:30:31.754 --> 00:30:33.075
Mrs. Skinner,
how did your husband


252
00:30:33.257 --> 00:30:34.586
happen to feed it
to the chickens?


253
00:30:34.587 --> 00:30:36.605
Well, when we found
out it weren't no oil,


254
00:30:36.921 --> 00:30:39.481
There was nothing to do about it,
so we fed it to the chicks.


255
00:30:39.783 --> 00:30:41.113
Right out of
the ground like that?


256
00:30:41.114 --> 00:30:42.615
No, miss.

257
00:30:42.616 --> 00:30:46.179
Nothing'll eat it unless
we mix it with chicken feed.


258
00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.669
And did all the chickens grow?

259
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:50.517
Only the baby chicks.

260
00:30:51.547 --> 00:30:53.521
Nothing seemed to
effect the grown ones.


261
00:30:53.522 --> 00:30:54.709
Nothing at all.

262
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:57.428
Nothing happens to the full-grown
chickens, is that right?


263
00:30:57.429 --> 00:31:00.648
Well, they didn't grow none,
if that's what you mean.


264
00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:02.624
But I didn't say
nothing happened to them.


265
00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.114
Well, what did happen?

266
00:31:05.115 --> 00:31:07.433
They got ate by
the real big ones.


267
00:31:09.451 --> 00:31:11.040
Come on, Lorna.

268
00:32:15.357 --> 00:32:17.230
Mrs. Skinner...
I don't like you.


269
00:32:17.265 --> 00:32:18.362
Well, if that stuff
is worth anything,


270
00:32:18.363 --> 00:32:21.793
I'd like an option until Miss Scott,
here gets the stuff analyzed.


271
00:32:21.883 --> 00:32:23.385
I don't want nothing
more to do with you.


272
00:32:23.386 --> 00:32:25.875
You didn't take me seriously
back there, did you?


273
00:32:25.876 --> 00:32:27.379
I was only
having a little joke.


274
00:32:27.894 --> 00:32:29.181
Jack, look!

275
00:32:56.575 --> 00:32:58.593
Oh, thank you.

276
00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.070
Did you see them?
It was last night.


277
00:33:02.071 --> 00:33:04.088
They were right there
in the middle of the road.


278
00:33:04.089 --> 00:33:05.076
Right in front of us.

279
00:33:05.591 --> 00:33:07.093
We almost hit one.
What were they?


280
00:33:07.094 --> 00:33:08.595
They couldn't have been
what they looked like.


281
00:33:08.596 --> 00:33:11.344
Yes, they were.
They were these huge rats.


282
00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.350
I've never seen
anything so ugly in my life.


283
00:33:14.666 --> 00:33:15.852
All right, we'll pull you out
and you follow us.


284
00:33:15.853 --> 00:33:17.870
It won't help.
I busted my rear axle.


285
00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:19.372
Are you going
back into the city?


286
00:33:19.373 --> 00:33:20.875
Well, we have to make
a stop at a farm, first,


287
00:33:20.876 --> 00:33:22.116
then we'll be going right back.

288
00:33:22.422 --> 00:33:23.408
Okay, but if we're still here,

289
00:33:23.409 --> 00:33:24.912
can we get a ride
back with you then?


290
00:33:25.427 --> 00:33:26.413
I think you'd
better come with us now.


291
00:33:26.414 --> 00:33:27.917
Oh, that's all right,
we'll be okay.


292
00:33:27.918 --> 00:33:29.849
We'll just stay inside the bus.

293
00:34:27.511 --> 00:34:28.500
Morgan.

294
00:34:55.591 --> 00:34:57.095
You okay?

295
00:34:59.885 --> 00:35:02.889
Damn fortunate
you happened along.


296
00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:06.582
Yeah. Well, actually,
we didn't just happen along.


297
00:35:06.583 --> 00:35:08.300
We came out here
to see Mr. Skinner.


298
00:35:08.301 --> 00:35:09.288
What about?

299
00:35:09.803 --> 00:35:12.035
Are you Mr. Skinner?
No, I'm not Mr. Skinner.


300
00:35:12.036 --> 00:35:14.526
Do you know about the food
the Skinners have up here?


301
00:35:14.527 --> 00:35:15.513
Yeah, a little.

302
00:35:15.514 --> 00:35:16.930
Well, I can tell you right now,

303
00:35:16.931 --> 00:35:18.432
if you're entertaining
any intentions


304
00:35:18.433 --> 00:35:20.879
of becoming involved,
you're too late.


305
00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.027
My company controls all rights.

306
00:35:24.015 --> 00:35:25.495
Well, then, maybe
it's not Mr. Skinner


307
00:35:25.517 --> 00:35:26.547
I want to see after all, is it?

308
00:35:26.548 --> 00:35:29.038
I'm not interested
in any partners.


309
00:35:29.039 --> 00:35:30.712
Until Mr. Skinner
comes home and says


310
00:35:30.713 --> 00:35:32.730
he wants you to have our food,

311
00:35:32.731 --> 00:35:36.336
Mr. Bensington,
nobody owns nothing but us.


312
00:35:36.337 --> 00:35:38.570
The good Lord give it to us
to do as we please.


313
00:35:41.232 --> 00:35:43.249
Well, it would appear
you were just moved back


314
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.268
three spaces and lose a turn.

315
00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.273
Well, anyway,
my company has first refusal.


316
00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:51.146
Miss Scott here was present when
Mr. Skinner made us an offer.


317
00:35:51.493 --> 00:35:52.738
That was yesterday morning.

318
00:35:52.739 --> 00:35:54.669
Well, then, I suppose legally,
you just might be right.


319
00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:56.172
No question about it.

320
00:35:56.173 --> 00:35:57.176
Good.

321
00:35:57.191 --> 00:36:00.166
When I throw our charges with the
district attorney, I'll know who to name.


322
00:36:00.239 --> 00:36:02.271
What the hell
are you talking about?


323
00:36:02.485 --> 00:36:05.026
Second degree murder, I guess
that's what they'll call it.


324
00:36:05.205 --> 00:36:07.937
My friend was killed by your wasps
yesterday afternoon.


325
00:36:07.938 --> 00:36:09.440
They're not my wasps.

326
00:36:09.441 --> 00:36:10.942
Well, if you own the stuff
that made them grow,


327
00:36:10.943 --> 00:36:12.960
I guess you're liable
for whatever they do.


328
00:36:12.961 --> 00:36:14.147
Now, wait a minute.

329
00:36:14.148 --> 00:36:15.251
Oh, we'll wait
more than a minute.


330
00:36:15.252 --> 00:36:16.195
My buddy here
and I are going to


331
00:36:16.196 --> 00:36:17.636
give you a hand
in cleaning them out.


332
00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.474
Well, you'd better get the hell
off this land. You're trespassing.


333
00:36:20.475 --> 00:36:21.461
Sorry, can't do that.

334
00:36:21.462 --> 00:36:22.964
We'll have to get
the wasps in their nests,


335
00:36:22.965 --> 00:36:25.026
and they don't go
home till after dark.


336
00:36:25.756 --> 00:36:27.559
Dirty bastards!

337
00:36:39.581 --> 00:36:40.868
I'm Lorna Scott.

338
00:36:40.869 --> 00:36:42.829
Oh, you're with
Mr. Wonderful over there?


339
00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:46.107
I'm in charge of the bacteriostasis
in his plant, yes.


340
00:36:46.108 --> 00:36:47.609
It must be fascinating work.

341
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:50.429
Since you're dying to know
what it is, I shall tell you.


342
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:53.577
I keep the bacteria growth
within an acceptable tolerance.


343
00:36:53.578 --> 00:36:55.596
How interesting.

344
00:36:55.697 --> 00:36:57.555
Brian, we're gonna need something
that'll work for a wick.


345
00:36:57.556 --> 00:37:00.704
Maybe some rope rubbed down with
powder from our shotgun shells,


346
00:37:00.705 --> 00:37:04.568
and some plaster or cement.
See if the Skinners have any, okay?


347
00:37:04.569 --> 00:37:07.188
You don't like women around when
you're doing your thing, do you?


348
00:37:07.461 --> 00:37:09.678
What's my thing?
Facing danger.


349
00:37:09.679 --> 00:37:10.666
I don't mind.

350
00:37:11.181 --> 00:37:12.169
Are you sure?

351
00:37:12.684 --> 00:37:14.186
What's there to mind?

352
00:37:14.187 --> 00:37:15.689
Oh, can I come along?

353
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:16.763
Why not?

354
00:37:18.266 --> 00:37:21.271
It won't be easy, but I think
I can learn to like you.


355
00:37:21.787 --> 00:37:23.288
You're the first man I've met
who has balls enough


356
00:37:23.289 --> 00:37:25.263
to beat Bensington
at one-upmanship.


357
00:37:25.264 --> 00:37:27.282
Really?
You're nice yourself.


358
00:37:29.601 --> 00:37:32.134
Thomas, she kicked.

359
00:37:34.624 --> 00:37:36.127
Right here.

360
00:37:38.703 --> 00:37:40.249
Like what you see?

361
00:37:43.469 --> 00:37:44.970
I realize I'm not very attractive

362
00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:46.251
being so pregnant
and all, but...


363
00:37:46.474 --> 00:37:49.078
No, it's not that.

364
00:37:49.079 --> 00:37:52.184
I just guess the whole thing
wasn't such a good idea, after all.


365
00:37:52.185 --> 00:37:54.631
I just thought we could
see things more clearly.


366
00:37:54.632 --> 00:37:57.637
Thomas, I'm seeing
things very clearly,


367
00:37:57.852 --> 00:37:59.182
and I'm not going
to change my mind.


368
00:37:59.183 --> 00:38:02.446
But it's my baby.
I want it to have my name.


369
00:38:02.447 --> 00:38:05.623
She'll have her own name.

370
00:38:05.624 --> 00:38:08.112
Did anybody ever tell you,
you're crazy?


371
00:38:08.113 --> 00:38:10.130
Why? Because I'm happy
we're having a baby?


372
00:38:10.131 --> 00:38:12.365
It'll be the same kid
even though we're married.


373
00:38:12.707 --> 00:38:14.725
But our relationship won't be,
yours and mine.


374
00:38:15.198 --> 00:38:16.442
But what's the difference,
damn it?


375
00:38:16.443 --> 00:38:18.202
We're still
the same two people.


376
00:38:18.203 --> 00:38:19.406
Just tell me
what the difference


377
00:38:19.407 --> 00:38:22.195
a lousy marriage certificate has
to do with our relationship?


378
00:38:22.196 --> 00:38:25.073
Hey, that is exactly what
I'm talking about. Nothing!


379
00:38:25.389 --> 00:38:27.607
And that's why
I don't want one.


380
00:38:28.809 --> 00:38:30.483
Thomas, look at me.

381
00:38:32.974 --> 00:38:34.476
You love me, don't you?

382
00:38:35.936 --> 00:38:37.652
And I love you.

383
00:38:37.653 --> 00:38:40.101
We live together.
We grow together.


384
00:39:02.598 --> 00:39:04.101
Do you believe that?

385
00:39:06.034 --> 00:39:07.536
It's huge.

386
00:39:10.027 --> 00:39:12.517
Come on, let's get
back to the farmhouse.


387
00:39:42.486 --> 00:39:45.017
Oh, God, forgive me
for doing bad things.


388
00:39:45.018 --> 00:39:49.828
I swear, I won't sin again if you
just return my husband to me.


389
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.305
A doctor ought to be taking
care of this, Mrs. Skinner.


390
00:39:53.306 --> 00:39:55.324
The Lord healeth the sick,
Lorna.


391
00:39:55.796 --> 00:39:57.298
That's from the Bible.

392
00:39:57.814 --> 00:40:00.818
Yeah, well, I think maybe you
should drive back with us tonight


393
00:40:00.819 --> 00:40:02.321
Oh, no, I can't do that.

394
00:40:02.322 --> 00:40:05.842
When Mr. Skinner returns,
he'll want me to be here.


395
00:40:05.843 --> 00:40:06.959
He will.

396
00:42:41.054 --> 00:42:41.870
Mr. Morgan.

397
00:42:44.145 --> 00:42:47.151
Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan.
They got Lorna


398
00:42:47.666 --> 00:42:48.906
God have mercy
on the poor girl.


399
00:42:49.169 --> 00:42:50.155
Well, what happened?
I'll show you.


400
00:42:50.156 --> 00:42:52.174
I'll get my gun.
Yeah.


401
00:43:02.766 --> 00:43:05.655
That slope in back of the house.
That's where we saw them.


402
00:43:05.656 --> 00:43:07.158
Then, all at once,
they came at us!


403
00:43:07.159 --> 00:43:11.294
And Lorna ran up on the slope,
but the earth gave way.


404
00:43:11.695 --> 00:43:14.672
She fell in there.

405
00:43:14.673 --> 00:43:18.236
That's where the big rats went.
But Lorna's down in there.


406
00:43:19.825 --> 00:43:21.113
Lorna!

407
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.601
Lorna, can you hear me?

408
00:43:23.602 --> 00:43:25.363
Morgan!

409
00:43:25.664 --> 00:43:27.637
Morgan, get me out of here!

410
00:43:27.638 --> 00:43:29.384
Okay, I'm coming down.

411
00:43:29.385 --> 00:43:30.566
You're sure they were rats?

412
00:43:30.688 --> 00:43:32.743
- I know a rat when I see one, mister.
- Give me a hand.


413
00:43:33.378 --> 00:43:34.937
They're nearly
as big as horses.


414
00:43:34.938 --> 00:43:37.929
Is there anything you didn't
feed the food to, Mrs. Skinner?


415
00:43:37.973 --> 00:43:39.746
Brian, get the rope and
flashlight from the jeep, okay?


416
00:43:39.862 --> 00:43:41.034
Right.

417
00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.481
Oh, Lord.

418
00:43:43.482 --> 00:43:47.889
It's happened, just as
Mr. Skinner said it would.


419
00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:51.168
Being punished 'cause
we sinned against nature.


420
00:43:51.682 --> 00:43:54.859
The only sin, Mrs. Skinner,
is your goddamn stupidity.


421
00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:57.435
You're not a good man,
Mr. Bensington.


422
00:43:57.436 --> 00:43:59.582
The things you say and do.

423
00:44:14.052 --> 00:44:15.081
You okay?

424
00:44:15.082 --> 00:44:17.100
Yeah.
Hand me the shotgun.


425
00:44:19.547 --> 00:44:20.835
Coming in.

426
00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:23.541
Got it?
Yeah.


427
00:44:42.776 --> 00:44:44.278
Take her up.

428
00:45:08.967 --> 00:45:11.027
Morgan! Morgan!

429
00:45:12.487 --> 00:45:13.990
Are you okay?
Yes.


430
00:45:16.008 --> 00:45:17.296
Morgan!

431
00:45:18.197 --> 00:45:19.227
Morgan!

432
00:45:20.215 --> 00:45:21.289
Morgan!

433
00:45:23.479 --> 00:45:25.196
Careful there.

434
00:45:27.471 --> 00:45:28.758
Where are those ratholes?

435
00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:30.263
There.

436
00:45:30.777 --> 00:45:31.765
There.

437
00:45:42.842 --> 00:45:44.859
Bensington,
will you go in with me?


438
00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:46.363
Don't be a fool.

439
00:47:16.484 --> 00:47:17.986
Thanks, Brian.

440
00:47:34.474 --> 00:47:35.977
You okay?

441
00:47:37.007 --> 00:47:38.981
Here.

442
00:47:38.982 --> 00:47:40.999
Thanks to you, kid,
we missed the last ferry.


443
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.503
You bastard.

444
00:47:53.409 --> 00:47:54.996
Thomas.

445
00:47:54.997 --> 00:47:57.014
Honey.
Yes?


446
00:47:57.015 --> 00:47:59.505
Please, could you just
lift me up, please.


447
00:47:59.506 --> 00:48:01.007
Yeah, sure.

448
00:48:02.511 --> 00:48:03.498
You all right?

449
00:48:06.504 --> 00:48:07.534
Oh, yeah.

450
00:48:09.037 --> 00:48:11.012
It stopped. It stopped

451
00:48:14.018 --> 00:48:16.036
What the hell was that?

452
00:48:17.023 --> 00:48:17.839
Thomas.

453
00:48:23.893 --> 00:48:26.684
Rita. Rita,
come to the door.


454
00:48:27.456 --> 00:48:29.088
Come on out.

455
00:48:30.591 --> 00:48:32.093
Tom, what is it?

456
00:48:35.099 --> 00:48:36.387
Oh, my God!

457
00:48:38.319 --> 00:48:39.521
Tom!

458
00:49:01.418 --> 00:49:02.921
Oh, Tom!

459
00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:07.343
Look at them.

460
00:49:07.816 --> 00:49:09.317
Tom.

461
00:49:09.318 --> 00:49:10.348
Come on, let's get out of here.

462
00:49:10.349 --> 00:49:11.852
Come on. Come on.

463
00:49:42.936 --> 00:49:45.469
Oh, Tom, I can't..

464
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:47.444
They're out there,
all over the place.


465
00:49:47.445 --> 00:49:49.977
- They're everywhere. They're everywhere.
- Big rats.


466
00:49:50.278 --> 00:49:51.952
Where? Out there on the road
where your camper was?


467
00:49:51.953 --> 00:49:53.970
By the camper, yeah.
Wait, how many were there?


468
00:49:53.971 --> 00:49:55.532
I don't know.
They're all over the road.


469
00:49:55.674 --> 00:49:57.748
Come on, Lorna, we'll drive right
through them.


470
00:49:57.749 --> 00:49:59.252
Hold it right there.

471
00:50:01.785 --> 00:50:03.202
What the hell
do you think you're doing?


472
00:50:03.203 --> 00:50:05.177
This car might be the only way
out of here for all of us.


473
00:50:05.178 --> 00:50:06.636
That's why I'm taking it.

474
00:50:06.637 --> 00:50:08.139
If anybody wants to come along,

475
00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:09.856
they can come.
Now give me the keys.


476
00:50:09.857 --> 00:50:11.102
Not until I know it's safe.

477
00:50:11.103 --> 00:50:12.004
Safe, hell!

478
00:50:12.276 --> 00:50:14.156
It's my car, god damn it!
Give me the keys.


479
00:50:14.538 --> 00:50:16.039
Okay, Bensington,
I'll give you your keys back,


480
00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.542
but if you try and
take any of these people


481
00:50:17.543 --> 00:50:19.104
out of here before
I tell you it's okay,


482
00:50:19.561 --> 00:50:22.909
you're gonna have more than
rats to fight. You got that?


483
00:50:23.898 --> 00:50:25.743
Hold it a second, Morgan.

484
00:50:25.744 --> 00:50:27.661
How could they get
at us inside the car?


485
00:50:27.662 --> 00:50:29.736
Well, after they force us off the
road, they'll give us a choice,


486
00:50:30.051 --> 00:50:31.351
of either dying inside the car

487
00:50:31.354 --> 00:50:32.785
or coming outside
and being eaten.


488
00:50:32.786 --> 00:50:35.703
Well, I don't hear you coming up
with a better suggestion.


489
00:50:35.704 --> 00:50:36.733
Well, how about this one?

490
00:50:36.734 --> 00:50:38.237
You and I go
for a ride in my jeep


491
00:50:38.238 --> 00:50:39.653
and take a little look
for ourselves, huh?


492
00:50:39.654 --> 00:50:40.942
What the hell for?

493
00:50:41.243 --> 00:50:43.433
I don't know. Maybe those kids
exaggerated a little.


494
00:50:43.434 --> 00:50:45.751
- I'm not interested.
- Maybe they exaggerated a lot.


495
00:50:45.752 --> 00:50:47.254
I'm still not interested.

496
00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.400
Well, just you and me,
Brian, let's go.


497
00:50:51.891 --> 00:50:53.908
Maybe he's right, Morgan.

498
00:50:53.909 --> 00:50:55.927
His car is closed.

499
00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.716
We could plow right
through the bastards.


500
00:50:58.717 --> 00:50:59.705
Okay, Brian, you go out there

501
00:50:59.706 --> 00:51:01.164
and plow right through
the rats with the man.


502
00:51:01.165 --> 00:51:03.353
If you don't make it,
no one can say you didn't try.


503
00:51:03.354 --> 00:51:05.328
All right, just tell me
one thing, okay?


504
00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:07.863
What the hell are we
going out there for?


505
00:51:09.108 --> 00:51:11.642
In this open jeep,
we don't stand a chance.


506
00:51:22.504 --> 00:51:24.007
Dumb bastards.

507
00:52:02.605 --> 00:52:04.409
They're even worse
than I thought.


508
00:52:40.518 --> 00:52:43.006
Jack?
Jack, the girl is sick.


509
00:52:43.007 --> 00:52:43.994
I don't know what to do.

510
00:52:43.995 --> 00:52:45.024
It's stopped.

511
00:52:45.025 --> 00:52:46.399
She could be
having a miscarriage.


512
00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.201
Help me! This is
the end of it. I want it all!


513
00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:49.962
Didn't you hear what I said?

514
00:52:49.963 --> 00:52:52.495
I said the girl is sick.
She could be dying.


515
00:52:52.496 --> 00:52:53.656
Find every container you can.

516
00:52:53.999 --> 00:52:56.317
Pails, bottles, jugs,
anything that'll hold it.


517
00:52:56.318 --> 00:52:58.149
We'll load the car
and then get out of here.


518
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:59.752
You don't give a damn
about the girl, do you?


519
00:52:59.753 --> 00:53:02.371
You don't give a damn about anybody,
but yourself and money.


520
00:53:02.372 --> 00:53:04.346
Do you know what
this food is worth?


521
00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:07.695
Enough millions, you can use
$100 bills for toilet paper.


522
00:53:07.696 --> 00:53:10.185
You can flush it down the toilet
without even counting it.


523
00:53:10.186 --> 00:53:13.190
Well, I didn't know that's what
you wanted money for, Jack.


524
00:53:13.191 --> 00:53:15.294
I'll give you one thing,
though, you're creative.


525
00:53:15.295 --> 00:53:18.601
You're a no good son of a bitch,
but you're creative.


526
00:53:27.703 --> 00:53:31.224
What are you stopping for?
What are you doing?


527
00:53:33.242 --> 00:53:36.248
You don't think that's going
to keep them out, do you?


528
00:53:43.246 --> 00:53:45.735
I'm going to follow that road,
right down there.


529
00:53:45.736 --> 00:53:49.255
That road?
That's the way the rats are coming.


530
00:53:49.256 --> 00:53:50.759
The rats are coming...

531
00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.734
Oh, relax, will you, Brian
? Relax.


532
00:54:10.467 --> 00:54:12.999
Well, we're in luck.
The fence runs right into the water.


533
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.004
Oh, Jesus Christ, Morgan!
You saw how big they are.


534
00:54:16.005 --> 00:54:19.011
This goddamn fence isn't going to stop
them, nothing's going to stop them.


535
00:54:19.012 --> 00:54:20.341
Well, maybe not.

536
00:54:20.342 --> 00:54:23.819
Even if it did, they can swim.
You know that? Rats can swim.


537
00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:25.222
They'll swim right
around the end of it.


538
00:54:25.223 --> 00:54:26.852
No, I don't think so.
I think if they go in the water,


539
00:54:26.853 --> 00:54:28.413
they'll sink
straight to the bottom.


540
00:54:28.414 --> 00:54:29.916
Come on, are you kidding me?

541
00:54:29.917 --> 00:54:32.793
You ever seen movies of
a hippopotamus in the water?


542
00:54:32.794 --> 00:54:34.053
I should swim so well.

543
00:54:34.054 --> 00:54:36.271
Yeah, well, they've been doing it
for a hell of a long time.


544
00:54:36.272 --> 00:54:37.058
So have rats.

545
00:54:37.059 --> 00:54:38.760
Yeah, at a weight
of about 10 ounces.


546
00:54:38.761 --> 00:54:39.748
So?

547
00:54:39.749 --> 00:54:41.051
At 150 pounds,

548
00:54:41.052 --> 00:54:43.269
the gravity pull is gonna make it
a whole new thing.


549
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:45.760
I think they're gonna have to learn
how to swim all over again.


550
00:54:46.275 --> 00:54:47.778
You could be wrong.

551
00:54:54.175 --> 00:54:56.192
.And the fence goes to
the water on this end, too


552
00:54:56.193 --> 00:54:59.199
If they attack us out here
in the open, we're dead.


553
00:55:06.756 --> 00:55:08.497
We've got an unbroken
wire fence running across


554
00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:10.747
the north side of the island, with
water on both sides.


555
00:55:10.748 --> 00:55:11.735
It won't even slow them down.

556
00:55:11.736 --> 00:55:13.195
Charged with electricity,
it will.


557
00:55:13.196 --> 00:55:15.684
You should see how
funny you look, Jack.


558
00:55:15.685 --> 00:55:17.660
You're scared shitless
the rats will come,


559
00:55:17.661 --> 00:55:19.291
but you want money
badly enough to chance it.


560
00:55:19.292 --> 00:55:22.340
Well, fill this, god damn it!
The stuff is drying up.


561
00:55:22.341 --> 00:55:24.830
I'm beginning to think maybe that
stuff should stay right where it is.


562
00:55:24.831 --> 00:55:27.020
What the hell
are you talking about?


563
00:55:27.021 --> 00:55:28.008
Well, it doesn't look so good,

564
00:55:28.009 --> 00:55:30.412
as a super-contribution
to the world, I mean.


565
00:55:30.413 --> 00:55:31.615
Starving people?

566
00:55:31.616 --> 00:55:33.417
And you're going to feed them
all with big chickens, right?


567
00:55:33.418 --> 00:55:35.908
Yeah, and giant cows and sheep,

568
00:55:35.909 --> 00:55:38.569
and ducks and fish,
and you name it!


569
00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:41.060
Yeah, well, it sounds good,
but wouldn't bigger creatures


570
00:55:41.061 --> 00:55:42.992
have larger appetites?

571
00:55:42.993 --> 00:55:44.494
I'm way ahead of you, kid.

572
00:55:44.495 --> 00:55:47.171
I'm going to take this stuff and
have it converted to plant food.


573
00:55:47.172 --> 00:55:49.862
Oh, and you're gonna feed all
the big animals with big plants.


574
00:55:49.863 --> 00:55:51.622
Right on.
And within five years,


575
00:55:51.623 --> 00:55:53.510
hunger will be
a thing of the past.


576
00:55:53.511 --> 00:55:55.486
And that's what you're
doing it for, is it, Jack?


577
00:55:55.487 --> 00:55:58.793
For the benefit of all the hungry
people throughout the world.


578
00:55:58.794 --> 00:55:59.880
Especially the children.

579
00:55:59.881 --> 00:56:01.582
Oh, God, you're going
to make me cry.


580
00:56:01.583 --> 00:56:03.600
Hey, Lorna, you surprise me.

581
00:56:03.601 --> 00:56:05.618
I always thought
you were like me.


582
00:56:05.619 --> 00:56:07.122
Anything for a buck.

583
00:56:07.123 --> 00:56:10.556
Oh, no, you underestimate
yourself, baby.


584
00:56:10.557 --> 00:56:12.875
Nobody could be
a whore like you.


585
00:56:12.876 --> 00:56:14.636
You're number one.

586
00:56:22.021 --> 00:56:24.038
I heard that argument
you had with Bensington.


587
00:56:24.039 --> 00:56:25.542
Are you that much concerned?

588
00:56:26.057 --> 00:56:27.043
No?

589
00:56:27.044 --> 00:56:28.131
Well, why'd you
throw away your job?


590
00:56:28.132 --> 00:56:29.834
I couldn't take the chance
the rats would get me


591
00:56:29.835 --> 00:56:32.754
before I told Bensington exactly
what I thought of him.


592
00:56:38.036 --> 00:56:39.538
You okay?

593
00:56:46.708 --> 00:56:48.725
I think I'm going
to be sick again.


594
00:56:48.726 --> 00:56:50.013
Get up. Come on.

595
00:57:04.999 --> 00:57:06.715
It's all my fault.

596
00:57:06.716 --> 00:57:08.977
Her pregnancy or
her being out here?


597
00:57:08.978 --> 00:57:09.866
Both.

598
00:57:09.981 --> 00:57:13.371
Well, it's too late to do
anything about either, isn't it?


599
00:57:13.372 --> 00:57:14.832
Oh, God, help us.

600
00:57:16.334 --> 00:57:18.093
I won't never sin again, never.

601
00:57:18.094 --> 00:57:22.431
Only don't let no rats eat us.
Please, God.


602
00:57:26.295 --> 00:57:27.798
- Is that enough?
- Yeah.


603
00:57:30.288 --> 00:57:31.791
Okay.
Good.


604
00:57:35.311 --> 00:57:36.814
Come on, baby.

605
00:57:40.336 --> 00:57:41.323
Choke this thing, here.

606
00:57:42.825 --> 00:57:44.500
There you go.

607
00:58:09.016 --> 00:58:11.034
Take the shotgun, Brian.

608
00:58:12.021 --> 00:58:13.523
You know something,

609
00:58:13.524 --> 00:58:16.529
I'm supposed to be in Chicago,
day after tomorrow.


610
00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:17.474
Yeah, I know.

611
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.976
Think I'll make it?

612
00:58:18.977 --> 00:58:20.479
I sure hope so.

613
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:23.614
Oh, Jesus, here they come.

614
00:58:27.178 --> 00:58:28.508
Don't shoot.

615
00:58:28.509 --> 00:58:29.926
What if it doesn't stop them?

616
00:58:50.277 --> 00:58:51.780
We won!

617
00:58:53.282 --> 00:58:54.742
Morgan, we won!

618
00:59:03.243 --> 00:59:04.883
All right, let's get
out of here. Come on.


619
00:59:11.873 --> 00:59:12.861
Okay.

620
00:59:32.997 --> 00:59:35.445
You were right!
They can't swim!


621
00:59:46.866 --> 00:59:48.368
Let's go.

622
00:59:53.435 --> 00:59:55.452
If I was a fish, I'd have thought
it was too easy.


623
00:59:55.453 --> 00:59:56.654
What's the matter?

624
00:59:56.655 --> 00:59:58.843
Did you count how many rats there
were back there at the water?


625
00:59:58.844 --> 01:00:00.561
- Just now?
- Yeah.


626
01:00:00.562 --> 01:00:01.849
No, I didn't count them.

627
01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:03.152
Yeah, well, if you had,
you'd find out


628
01:00:03.153 --> 01:00:04.339
that there's only
half the bastards


629
01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:05.327
we left back there
at that generator.


630
01:00:05.328 --> 01:00:06.830
So what?

631
01:00:06.831 --> 01:00:08.332
So, I think the rest
are up to something else.


632
01:00:08.333 --> 01:00:09.364
Like what?

633
01:00:09.836 --> 01:00:11.854
Like, we better
find out damn quick.


634
01:00:18.767 --> 01:00:20.570
Where the hell are you going?

635
01:00:21.901 --> 01:00:24.132
Come on, Morgan,
let's break this down.


636
01:00:24.133 --> 01:00:26.667
Come on, let's get
the hell out of here.


637
01:00:48.092 --> 01:00:49.079
Oh, God.

638
01:00:49.894 --> 01:00:51.354
Brian!

639
01:01:03.935 --> 01:01:04.750
Brian!

640
01:01:09.602 --> 01:01:10.848
Morgan!

641
01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:21.795
Morgan!

642
01:02:04.044 --> 01:02:06.576
If you care for that girl
in there with your baby,


643
01:02:06.577 --> 01:02:07.821
you better change your mind.

644
01:02:07.822 --> 01:02:10.527
Once I leave here, none of
you are going to get out alive.


645
01:02:10.528 --> 01:02:12.568
I couldn't take Rita back
out there with those rats.


646
01:02:13.017 --> 01:02:14.004
There's no way.

647
01:02:14.005 --> 01:02:15.508
You just didn't
see them like we did.


648
01:02:15.723 --> 01:02:17.997
Now, you listen to me, you get
that pregnant girl of yours


649
01:02:17.998 --> 01:02:19.501
out of here and into that car.

650
01:02:20.016 --> 01:02:21.474
And don't give me any bullshit.

651
01:02:21.475 --> 01:02:22.934
And the old lady goes, too.

652
01:02:22.935 --> 01:02:24.439
Well, get them, god damn it!

653
01:02:26.928 --> 01:02:28.002
Yeah, that's right, Jack.

654
01:02:28.517 --> 01:02:30.834
You be sure and take
Mrs. Skinner with you.


655
01:02:30.835 --> 01:02:33.326
You'll need her signature
for the rights, won't you?


656
01:02:43.889 --> 01:02:46.378
What happened to your friend?
He run out on you?


657
01:02:55.825 --> 01:02:58.571
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

658
01:02:58.572 --> 01:03:01.878
Hey, come on.
Hey, let go of me, you son of a bitch


659
01:03:04.411 --> 01:03:08.832
Hey, hey! No, stop it!
Please, stop it!


660
01:03:08.833 --> 01:03:10.337
Stop, no!

661
01:03:17.635 --> 01:03:18.623
No!

662
01:03:21.886 --> 01:03:24.891
Oh, Lord!
Look! Look, look!


663
01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:29.056
Get the shotgun!

664
01:04:03.704 --> 01:04:05.208
Mr. Thomas.

665
01:04:27.534 --> 01:04:28.607
Thomas!

666
01:04:48.486 --> 01:04:50.548
Listen, everything's
going to be okay.


667
01:04:52.952 --> 01:04:56.473
Better go in the bedroom with Rita.
She's not feeling too well.


668
01:04:56.988 --> 01:04:58.468
Looks like
the white one's the leader.


669
01:05:04.415 --> 01:05:06.390
Save your energy, Thomas.
They're out of shotgun range.


670
01:05:06.391 --> 01:05:08.723
Hey, we scared them off.
Yeah, for a while anyway.


671
01:05:08.724 --> 01:05:10.225
For a while? We can hold them
off forever, man.


672
01:05:10.226 --> 01:05:11.314
Just cool it, will you?

673
01:05:11.329 --> 01:05:13.102
Mr. Morgan!

674
01:05:13.403 --> 01:05:16.051
Mr. Morgan, the well's run dry.

675
01:05:16.523 --> 01:05:20.515
I been pumping and pumping
since the Lord knows when.


676
01:05:20.516 --> 01:05:21.561
Yeah, well,
you can stop pumping.


677
01:05:21.562 --> 01:05:24.166
Those rats have cut through
the pipe right to the well.


678
01:05:24.381 --> 01:05:26.083
What do we do about water?

679
01:05:26.084 --> 01:05:27.901
That's the least of our problems.
Those rats will be in here


680
01:05:27.902 --> 01:05:29.703
long before
we ever get too thirsty.


681
01:05:29.704 --> 01:05:31.164
Oh, my God.

682
01:05:38.763 --> 01:05:39.793
Hey, Morgan, how do we know

683
01:05:39.794 --> 01:05:42.285
we can't reach them
with our shotguns out there?


684
01:05:44.775 --> 01:05:47.393
Boy, just another 20 feet closer,
we'd get them all.


685
01:05:56.067 --> 01:05:57.884
Hey, you're
ruining those shells!


686
01:05:57.885 --> 01:06:00.574
Yeah, I know. But that's all we
got left to save us.


687
01:06:00.575 --> 01:06:02.076
Hey, look, Thomas, count
the shells we've got.


688
01:06:02.077 --> 01:06:03.580
If we're lucky enough
to knock out one rat


689
01:06:03.581 --> 01:06:04.682
with each shell,
there'd still be


690
01:06:04.683 --> 01:06:07.014
enough of those bastards left to
hold a hell of a people barbecue.


691
01:06:07.015 --> 01:06:08.989
Oh, you've got an answer
for everything, don't you?


692
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:10.292
Well, maybe we shouldn't
have listened to you,


693
01:06:10.293 --> 01:06:11.994
maybe Bensington was right.

694
01:06:11.995 --> 01:06:13.116
Yeah, you got a point there.

695
01:06:13.542 --> 01:06:15.062
Well, nothing gets
to you, god damn it!


696
01:06:15.173 --> 01:06:16.675
We could've been
the hell away from here


697
01:06:16.676 --> 01:06:19.380
if it wasn't for you.

698
01:06:19.381 --> 01:06:21.713
I'll tell you what. Bensington's
car is still out there.


699
01:06:21.714 --> 01:06:23.771
You can take it if you want to.
I'm sure he won't mind.


700
01:06:33.850 --> 01:06:36.511
I know all about
delivering babies.


701
01:06:36.512 --> 01:06:39.216
Living on a farm,
you get to know those things.


702
01:06:39.217 --> 01:06:41.707
Everything's
going to be all right.


703
01:07:01.114 --> 01:07:03.132
- Lorna.
- Yeah.


704
01:07:05.107 --> 01:07:06.610
Can you handle one of these.
Sure.


705
01:07:07.125 --> 01:07:07.939
You ever shot one?
No.


706
01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:09.957
Oh, terrific.
Well, it's ready to go.


707
01:07:09.958 --> 01:07:11.998
Hold it tight against
your shoulder. It kicks, okay?


708
01:07:12.105 --> 01:07:13.136
Yeah.

709
01:08:29.432 --> 01:08:35.171
God, I know my husband isn't coming
back to me. I know it, I know it.


710
01:08:37.061 --> 01:08:39.951
Was the finest man
in the whole world.


711
01:08:48.151 --> 01:08:50.126
Is it possible that
Bensington was right?


712
01:08:50.127 --> 01:08:51.448
We could have
driven through them?


713
01:08:51.629 --> 01:08:53.646
Yeah, it's possible.

714
01:08:53.647 --> 01:08:57.253
How can you be so cool?
Aren't you afraid?


715
01:08:57.254 --> 01:08:59.271
Sure, but I'm more bothered
that those rats are out there


716
01:08:59.272 --> 01:09:00.775
trying to outsmart me.

717
01:09:04.768 --> 01:09:07.644
If I told you how I felt right now,
you'd think I was crazy.


718
01:09:07.645 --> 01:09:09.876
Tell me.

719
01:09:09.877 --> 01:09:12.282
I want you to make love to me.

720
01:09:13.784 --> 01:09:16.403
It is crazy, isn't it?
At a time like this.


721
01:09:21.941 --> 01:09:22.929
Listen,
the first thing we'll do


722
01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:23.816
when we get back
to the mainland


723
01:09:23.817 --> 01:09:25.534
is continue this
conversation, okay?


724
01:09:25.535 --> 01:09:28.425
But that's just it, I don't think
we'll ever get back.


725
01:09:32.890 --> 01:09:34.866
They're attacking again.
I need more shells.


726
01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:08.956
How's it going?

727
01:10:10.459 --> 01:10:11.962
I've been lying here,
thinking about what


728
01:10:11.977 --> 01:10:14.408
it's going to be like
when those rats get inside.


729
01:10:14.409 --> 01:10:16.383
Morgan says
we're gonna be fine.


730
01:10:16.384 --> 01:10:17.886
Do you believe that?

731
01:10:21.579 --> 01:10:25.085
You know, I used to think
about dying a lot.


732
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:30.596
I'd sort of lie there in bed,
at night, in the dark.


733
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:35.532
I guess I've always
had a terrible fear of it.


734
01:10:35.533 --> 01:10:37.250
Rita, don't.

735
01:10:37.251 --> 01:10:40.686
I used to fantasize
the most horrible death.


736
01:10:42.188 --> 01:10:44.421
You know, the most frightening.

737
01:10:47.298 --> 01:10:50.946
None of them come close
to being eaten by rats.


738
01:10:54.082 --> 01:10:57.087
The funny thing is,
now that it's happening,


739
01:11:00.607 --> 01:11:03.956
it really doesn't seem
to matter, except for my baby.


740
01:11:06.103 --> 01:11:07.606
What do you think
our chances are?


741
01:11:08.121 --> 01:11:09.107
Pretty good.

742
01:11:09.108 --> 01:11:10.095
Like hell.

743
01:11:10.096 --> 01:11:12.113
Have it your way.

744
01:11:12.114 --> 01:11:14.131
Any minute now those rats
are going to bust in here,


745
01:11:14.132 --> 01:11:16.493
and you're still fussing around
with some lousy jars.


746
01:11:16.494 --> 01:11:17.480
Well, it's something to do.

747
01:11:17.481 --> 01:11:18.725
Something to do?

748
01:11:18.726 --> 01:11:21.645
That, my dear boy,
is what life is all about.


749
01:11:21.646 --> 01:11:23.563
From the time you're born,
it's finding something to do


750
01:11:23.564 --> 01:11:26.798
while you're waiting to die,
and you try like hell to prevent it.


751
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:29.760
I'm not afraid to die,

752
01:11:29.761 --> 01:11:32.293
'cause it means
I'll be with my husband again.


753
01:11:32.294 --> 01:11:33.796
I'm not afraid.

754
01:11:34.827 --> 01:11:35.814
Not afraid.

755
01:11:36.330 --> 01:11:37.360
Now, you get your ass
in gear and get over there,


756
01:11:37.832 --> 01:11:40.065
and put that strip in that
gasoline jar and move it!


757
01:11:56.251 --> 01:11:58.268
I think we ought to at least
talk about it. All of us.


758
01:11:58.269 --> 01:11:59.771
Yeah, about what?
Bensington's car.


759
01:11:59.772 --> 01:12:01.746
It's still out there, and
the rats haven't hurt it.


760
01:12:01.747 --> 01:12:03.121
I'll tell you what,
we'll take a vote on it.


761
01:12:03.122 --> 01:12:05.138
- Good. If we...
- After we come back.


762
01:12:05.139 --> 01:12:06.169
From where?

763
01:12:06.685 --> 01:12:07.671
Say, I'm not
going to leave Rita,


764
01:12:07.672 --> 01:12:08.744
if that's what you're thinking.

765
01:12:08.745 --> 01:12:11.365
Pick up those jars
of gasoline, Thomas!


766
01:12:12.868 --> 01:12:14.284
You're going to kill us.

767
01:12:14.285 --> 01:12:15.787
Now open the front door!

768
01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:50.717
Oh, God.

769
01:13:54.624 --> 01:13:55.955
God!

770
01:14:16.221 --> 01:14:17.208
No!

771
01:14:41.252 --> 01:14:42.240
Oh, no!

772
01:15:17.876 --> 01:15:20.709
I think the baby
means it this time.


773
01:15:46.643 --> 01:15:47.923
How did you know
there was a dam?


774
01:15:48.146 --> 01:15:49.175
Mrs. Skinner told me.

775
01:17:02.853 --> 01:17:05.086
Don't let the baby die
, please.


776
01:17:12.084 --> 01:17:15.046
Can you see?
Can you see the head?


777
01:17:15.319 --> 01:17:16.449
Push.

778
01:17:25.552 --> 01:17:27.026
Is the head coming?

779
01:17:36.214 --> 01:17:37.201
It's showing its head.

780
01:17:37.717 --> 01:17:38.703
Yeah?

781
01:17:38.704 --> 01:17:39.735
Yeah. Now, push.

782
01:17:40.422 --> 01:17:41.452
Push.

783
01:17:55.191 --> 01:17:56.050
Okay.

784
01:18:00.086 --> 01:18:01.845
Is it a boy? What is it?

785
01:18:01.846 --> 01:18:03.347
It's a boy.

786
01:18:03.348 --> 01:18:05.323
It's a boy? It's a boy.

787
01:18:13.654 --> 01:18:16.142
Jesus. We'll never get...
We won't by sitting here.


788
01:18:16.143 --> 01:18:18.420
Come on.
Light this thing.


789
01:18:43.022 --> 01:18:44.868
Everybody upstairs, now!

790
01:19:58.587 --> 01:19:59.489
Morgan!

791
01:21:12.265 --> 01:21:14.068
Oh, God, no!

792
01:23:24.248 --> 01:23:26.652
Well, I guess
that's the end of them.


793
01:23:26.853 --> 01:23:30.431
The end of Bensington's one
last big shot at immortality.


794
01:24:26.289 --> 01:24:28.907
We were able to get Thomas's
camper fixed long enough


795
01:24:28.908 --> 01:24:32.900
to get us back to the ferry and
away from that nightmare for good.


796
01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:34.318
I'm back with the team,

797
01:24:34.319 --> 01:24:37.896
and things won't be the same
without Brian and Davis.


798
01:24:38.297 --> 01:24:39.799
My father was right.

799
01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:43.892
The land rebelled much worse than
he ever could have imagined.


800
01:24:43.893 --> 01:24:47.413
Nature was attacked,
and hit back with a vengeance.


801
01:24:48.402 --> 01:24:50.119
I hope we got it all,

802
01:24:50.262 --> 01:24:53.982
and the Food of the Gods has gone
back to wherever it came from.


803
01:24:53.983 --> 01:24:55.656
I hate to think
what would happen


804
01:24:55.657 --> 01:24:58.190
if even a trace of
that stuff is left.


805
01:24:58.191 --> 01:24:59.692
If it got into
the watering ponds


806
01:24:59.693 --> 01:25:03.170
or into the irrigation ditches.

807
01:25:03.171 --> 01:25:07.164
Did we get it all?
Because if we didn't...
