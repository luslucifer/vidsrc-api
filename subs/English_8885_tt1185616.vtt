1
00:03:07.174 --> 00:03:10.344
<i>They stand there, barking.
Twenty-six dogs.</i>


2
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:14.348
<i>I see their mean faces.
They've come to kill.</i>


3
00:03:14.765 --> 00:03:17.351
And they tell my boss Bertold:

4
00:03:18.727 --> 00:03:23.357
"Give us Boaz Rein or we'll eat
your customers. In one minute."


5
00:03:23.524 --> 00:03:25.693
- Twenty-six dogs?
- Exactly.


6
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.239
How do you know
there are 26 and not 30?


7
00:03:30.531 --> 00:03:32.450
I'm coming to that.

8
00:03:37.413 --> 00:03:39.081
- Well?
- Well what?


9
00:03:39.248 --> 00:03:44.295
- Do you check it out?
- What do you think happens?


10
00:03:45.212 --> 00:03:49.008
- I wake up.
- At that point every time?


11
00:03:49.175 --> 00:03:51.427
Exactly. It always stops there.

12
00:03:51.594 --> 00:03:54.346
- Since when?
- Two and a half years.


13
00:03:54.513 --> 00:03:57.475
- And you call me now? At this hour?
- Asshole.


14
00:03:57.641 --> 00:04:00.352
Don't call me an asshole.

15
00:04:02.146 --> 00:04:04.857
This dream is coming
from somewhere.


16
00:04:05.024 --> 00:04:09.320
- I haven't told you everything.
- Like what?


17
00:04:09.487 --> 00:04:11.322
You know, in Lebanon....

18
00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.073
What about Lebanon?

19
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.161
At the start of the war,
we went into Lebanese villages...


20
00:04:17.328 --> 00:04:21.081
...to search for wanted Palestinians.

21
00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:23.000
Yeah, and...?

22
00:04:38.557 --> 00:04:44.522
<i>When someone enters a village,
the dogs smell and bark to alert.</i>


23
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:51.445
<i>Everyone wakes up
and the fugitives take off.</i>


24
00:04:51.612 --> 00:04:55.991
Someone had to liquidate them.
Otherwise our men would have died.


25
00:04:56.158 --> 00:04:58.410
But why you?

26
00:04:58.577 --> 00:05:02.748
They knew I couldn't shoot a person.
They told me:


27
00:05:02.915 --> 00:05:06.460
"Go ahead and shoot the dogs."

28
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.481
Twenty-six dogs,
I remember every single one.


29
00:05:27.648 --> 00:05:33.487
Every face, every wound, the look
in their eyes. Twenty-six dogs.


30
00:05:33.654 --> 00:05:36.490
How long before they started
appearing in your dreams?


31
00:05:36.657 --> 00:05:38.033
Twenty years.

32
00:05:38.826 --> 00:05:41.829
- Have you tried anything?
- Like what?


33
00:05:41.996 --> 00:05:46.250
Therapy, a psychiatrist,
shiatsu, anything.


34
00:05:46.417 --> 00:05:49.169
No, nothing. I called you.

35
00:05:49.336 --> 00:05:51.088
I'm just a filmmaker.

36
00:05:51.255 --> 00:05:53.173
Can't films be therapeutic?

37
00:05:53.507 --> 00:05:56.927
You've dealt with all the issues
in your films, right?


38
00:05:57.344 --> 00:06:00.180
But nothing like this.

39
00:06:00.347 --> 00:06:02.016
No flashbacks from Lebanon?

40
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.812
No. Not really.

41
00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.814
Are you sure?

42
00:06:10.357 --> 00:06:11.609
No.

43
00:06:11.775 --> 00:06:14.028
- Beirut, Sabra and Shatila?
- What about that?


44
00:06:14.194 --> 00:06:17.364
You were only 100 yards away
from the massacre.


45
00:06:17.531 --> 00:06:21.201
More like 200 or 300 yards.

46
00:06:21.368 --> 00:06:25.331
The truth is
that's not stored in my system.


47
00:06:25.497 --> 00:06:29.043
No flashbacks or dreams?
You never think about it?


48
00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:31.503
No, no.

49
00:06:31.795 --> 00:06:33.297
No.

50
00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:40.471
You'll be okay, huh?

51
00:06:41.388 --> 00:06:43.682
- You think so?
- Sure.


52
00:06:43.974 --> 00:06:47.353
- You're sure?
- Yes. I'll think of something.


53
00:06:47.728 --> 00:06:50.731
- Sure?
- Sure.


54
00:07:27.768 --> 00:07:31.313
<i>The meeting with Boaz
took place in winter, 2006.</i>


55
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.693
<i>That night,
for the first time in 20 years...</i>


56
00:07:35.859 --> 00:07:38.946
<i>...I had a flashback
of the war in Lebanon.</i>


57
00:07:39.113 --> 00:07:43.784
<i>Not just Lebanon, West Beirut.
Not just Beirut...</i>


58
00:07:43.951 --> 00:07:48.914
<i>...but the massacre at the
Sabra and Shatila refugee camps.</i>


59
00:09:15.459 --> 00:09:18.921
What's wrong?
It's 6:30 in the morning.


60
00:09:19.421 --> 00:09:24.718
We all have friends
who are lawyers, doctors, therapists.


61
00:09:24.885 --> 00:09:28.639
Sometimes that friendship
costs them.


62
00:09:28.806 --> 00:09:32.392
But you wouldn't
wake your lawyer friend at 6:30.


63
00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:36.021
My lawyer is

64
00:09:36.605 --> 00:09:38.690
I just don't understand.

65
00:09:38.857 --> 00:09:46.240
Why Boaz's dream with the dogs?

66
00:09:47.032 --> 00:09:51.411
Why that to jog my memory?
It has nothing to do with me.


67
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.497
Memory is fascinating.

68
00:09:54.873 --> 00:09:57.251
Take this psychological experiment.

69
00:10:00.462 --> 00:10:06.635
<i>A group of people were shown

70
00:10:07.135 --> 00:10:10.764
<i>Nine were really from their childhood
and one was fake:</i>


71
00:10:10.931 --> 00:10:18.564
<i>Their portrait was pasted
into a fairground they never visited.</i>


72
00:10:22.442 --> 00:10:25.696
Eighty percent
recognized themselves.


73
00:10:25.863 --> 00:10:29.283
They recognized the fake photo
as real!


74
00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:32.452
Twenty percent couldn't remember.

75
00:10:32.619 --> 00:10:34.955
The researchers asked them again.

76
00:10:35.455 --> 00:10:39.418
<i>The second time, the others said
that they remembered the image.</i>


77
00:10:40.669 --> 00:10:44.381
<i>"Such a wonderful day at the park
with my parents."</i>


78
00:10:44.548 --> 00:10:48.135
<i>They remembered
a completely fabricated experience.</i>


79
00:10:49.136 --> 00:10:52.264
<i>Memory is dynamic. 
It's alive.</i>

80
00:10:52.431 --> 00:10:55.684
<i>If some details are missing...</i>

81
00:10:55.851 --> 00:11:00.981
<i>...memory fills the holes
with things that never happened.</i>


82
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:09.740
So my vision of the massacre
is like the fake photo?


83
00:11:09.907 --> 00:11:14.494
It never happened?
I invented it? It's not real?


84
00:11:14.661 --> 00:11:17.831
I don't know.
Who was there with you?


85
00:11:17.998 --> 00:11:22.085
Carmi was there.
You know him from school.


86
00:11:23.128 --> 00:11:25.923
And someone else I don't recognize.

87
00:11:27.466 --> 00:11:31.678
- So go ask Carmi what he remembers.
- He's in Holland.


88
00:11:31.845 --> 00:11:34.181
He's lived there for 20 years.

89
00:11:34.348 --> 00:11:38.602
Go to Holland and ask him,
if it bothers you.


90
00:11:38.769 --> 00:11:40.062
Isn't that dangerous?

91
00:11:40.228 --> 00:11:44.358
Maybe I'll discover things
I don't want to know about myself.


92
00:11:44.524 --> 00:11:46.193
Not at all.

93
00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.656
You'll discover important things
that you want to know.


94
00:11:50.822 --> 00:11:55.035
We don't go places
where we really don't want to.


95
00:11:55.202 --> 00:11:59.623
A human mechanism prevents us
from entering dark places.


96
00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:03.877
Memory takes us
where we need to go.


97
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.416
See all that?

98
00:12:44.042 --> 00:12:45.419
Yes.

99
00:12:45.752 --> 00:12:47.879
It's all mine.

100
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.467
All of it?

101
00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:55.595
From those trees to the river.

102
00:12:55.762 --> 00:12:58.098
- It all belongs to you?
- Yes, and the house.


103
00:12:59.182 --> 00:13:01.476
It's about 10 acres.

104
00:13:03.145 --> 00:13:07.065
- All that just from selling falafel?
- Just from falafel.


105
00:13:07.232 --> 00:13:10.485
- Wow.
- Come and see.


106
00:13:14.489 --> 00:13:18.452
- How much falafel did you sell?
- Three years was enough.


107
00:13:18.994 --> 00:13:22.748
In the early '90s,
I had a small stand in Utrecht.


108
00:13:22.914 --> 00:13:27.544
Health food was in fashion,
the Middle East too.


109
00:13:27.711 --> 00:13:31.381
Falafel is both healthy
and Middle Eastern.


110
00:13:31.798 --> 00:13:35.761
Everyone thought you'd become
a nuclear physicist.


111
00:13:36.595 --> 00:13:37.804
Who did?

112
00:13:38.263 --> 00:13:41.975
I don't know. Your family,
my family, our school friends.


113
00:13:42.601 --> 00:13:47.814
They thought that by the age of 40,
you'd be nominated for a Nobel Prize.


114
00:13:47.981 --> 00:13:49.983
By 20, that future was over.

115
00:13:51.943 --> 00:13:52.986
Cold?

116
00:13:53.153 --> 00:13:57.240
- Cold? I'm freezing.
- Let's go inside.


117
00:13:57.991 --> 00:14:01.828
We have to walk all that way?

118
00:14:01.995 --> 00:14:04.956
It's funny you've showed up now.

119
00:14:05.123 --> 00:14:07.334
- Why?
- When you called...


120
00:14:08.001 --> 00:14:12.672
...I had just gone out with
my son Thomas. He's 7.


121
00:14:12.839 --> 00:14:16.843
He was playing with a toy gun
and started asking questions:


122
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.055
"What did you do in the army?
Ever shoot anyone?"


123
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.974
- Did you?
- I don't know.


124
00:14:23.391 --> 00:14:27.104
Let's go inside and warm up.

125
00:14:27.521 --> 00:14:32.150
Would you mind if I sketch
you and your son playing in the snow?


126
00:14:32.317 --> 00:14:33.318
No.

127
00:14:34.152 --> 00:14:37.697
Not at all. Draw
as much as you like.

128
00:14:37.864 --> 00:14:39.574
I'll fetch him.

129
00:14:39.741 --> 00:14:42.869
It's fine as long as you draw,
but don't film.


130
00:15:52.772 --> 00:15:57.944
<i>As strange as it sounds,
we were transported to war...</i>


131
00:15:58.111 --> 00:16:03.658
<i>...on a little Love Boat leased
by the army or God knows what.</i>


132
00:16:04.326 --> 00:16:08.997
They wanted to mislead the enemy
and launch a surprise attack.


133
00:16:09.331 --> 00:16:15.170
What do you mean, a "Love Boat"?
With Jacuzzis and bars?


134
00:16:15.378 --> 00:16:20.675
- All of that?
- That's how I imagined it.


135
00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:27.641
I later found out it was
just an old commando boat.


136
00:16:27.807 --> 00:16:32.687
For 18, you seemed pretty bright
to me. I never took you for a fighter.


137
00:16:32.896 --> 00:16:36.942
Frankly, it was important to me
for a pretty practical reason.


138
00:16:37.108 --> 00:16:41.321
I felt like everyone else
was screwing like rabbits...


139
00:16:41.488 --> 00:16:44.366
...and that I was the only....
How can I put it?


140
00:16:44.532 --> 00:16:48.328
The only nerd
good at chess and math...


141
00:16:48.995 --> 00:16:53.833
...but with masculinity problems.
So I had to prove to everyone...


142
00:16:54.125 --> 00:16:57.170
...that I was the best fighter
and some big hero.


143
00:16:57.337 --> 00:16:59.256
Did you succeed?

144
00:17:00.215 --> 00:17:02.467
Yes, surprisingly enough.

145
00:17:03.093 --> 00:17:05.595
I felt that I was strong and capable.

146
00:17:06.888 --> 00:17:13.812
Then the war started and they
put us on that damned Love Boat.


147
00:17:14.104 --> 00:17:17.440
- Then I....
- You what?


148
00:17:17.607 --> 00:17:23.280
<i>I puked like a pig. I wondered
what the enemy would think.</i>


149
00:17:23.822 --> 00:17:26.866
<i>I finally collapsed on deck
and fell asleep.</i>


150
00:17:27.826 --> 00:17:30.578
<i>I sleep when I'm scared.</i>

151
00:17:31.705 --> 00:17:34.833
To this day,
I escape into sleep and hallucinate.


152
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.585
<i>Unconscious on the deck...</i>

153
00:18:21.755 --> 00:18:28.094
<i>...dreaming a woman would come...</i>

154
00:18:31.931 --> 00:18:35.101
<i>...and take me for the first time...</i>

155
00:18:38.063 --> 00:18:42.859
<i>...I saw my best friends
go up in flames before my eyes.</i>


156
00:18:43.276 --> 00:18:46.363
- Where?
- On the boat.


157
00:19:19.187 --> 00:19:23.817
I woke up just before we docked.
It's dawn, and we're in a city.


158
00:19:23.983 --> 00:19:26.486
- Which city?
- How should I know?


159
00:19:26.945 --> 00:19:28.988
Sidon, I think.

160
00:19:29.614 --> 00:19:34.911
<i>Out of pure fear and anxiety,
we start shooting like lunatics.</i>


161
00:19:37.288 --> 00:19:39.457
<i>- At whom?
- How do I know?</i>


162
00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:44.587
<i>Then an old Mercedes drives up.</i>

163
00:19:44.754 --> 00:19:47.924
<i>Everyone fires at it like crazy.</i>

164
00:19:51.511 --> 00:19:54.180
<i>Two years of training,
and the fear...</i>


165
00:19:54.347 --> 00:19:57.350
<i>...the uncontrollable fear....</i>

166
00:20:00.145 --> 00:20:05.525
<i>Then the silence.
The terrible silence of death.</i>


167
00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.027
<i>At daybreak...</i>

168
00:20:09.529 --> 00:20:14.367
<i>...we could see our destruction...</i>

169
00:20:17.245 --> 00:20:19.873
<i>...without knowing where we were.</i>

170
00:20:20.039 --> 00:20:22.250
<i>Lying in the car....</i>

171
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.795
<i>What was in the car?</i>

172
00:20:25.962 --> 00:20:27.714
<i>The bodies of a whole family.</i>

173
00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:31.050
Why did you come here?

174
00:20:31.509 --> 00:20:34.554
Me? I....

175
00:20:34.721 --> 00:20:36.222
I lost my memory.

176
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.476
- In an accident?
- What?


177
00:20:39.684 --> 00:20:43.062
- Did you have an accident?
- What do you mean?


178
00:20:43.229 --> 00:20:46.149
In a car or at work?

179
00:20:46.357 --> 00:20:49.068
No, I didn't have an accident.

180
00:20:49.235 --> 00:20:54.574
I just can't remember anything
about the Lebanon War.


181
00:20:54.741 --> 00:20:59.245
Just one image in my mind.

182
00:20:59.412 --> 00:21:02.248
Somehow you're in it.

183
00:21:03.333 --> 00:21:04.375
What image?

184
00:21:41.955 --> 00:21:44.958
Were you there too?

185
00:21:46.584 --> 00:21:47.961
It's hard to say.

186
00:21:48.127 --> 00:21:50.129
What do you mean?
Were you there?


187
00:21:50.296 --> 00:21:52.715
It's hard to say.

188
00:21:53.007 --> 00:21:55.468
I don't remember anything
about the massacre.


189
00:21:56.135 --> 00:22:00.306
But you were in Beirut
when the massacre took place.


190
00:22:00.473 --> 00:22:02.058
Yes, I remember being there.

191
00:22:02.225 --> 00:22:05.311
I'll never forget
us marching into Beirut.


192
00:22:05.478 --> 00:22:08.481
But the massacre....
How did you say it?


193
00:22:08.648 --> 00:22:11.401
That's not stored in my system.

194
00:22:11.901 --> 00:22:14.529
- Right.
- Massacre....


195
00:22:51.107 --> 00:22:55.403
<i>Then it happened in a taxi
to Amsterdam Airport.</i>


196
00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.865
<i>Suddenly, all the memories
came back.</i>


197
00:22:59.198 --> 00:23:01.868
<i>Not a hallucination,
nor my subconscious.</i>


198
00:23:02.035 --> 00:23:06.873
<i>The first day of the war. Barely 19,
I haven't even started shaving.</i>


199
00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.126
<i>We're driving down a road.
Orchards on one side...</i>


200
00:23:10.293 --> 00:23:15.298
<i>...the sea on the other.
We're shooting everywhere...</i>


201
00:23:15.465 --> 00:23:17.717
<i>...at everything, until nightfall.</i>

202
00:23:22.472 --> 00:23:26.392
<i>That evening, when we stopped,
an officer tells me:</i>


203
00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:30.146
<i>"Load up the dead and wounded.</i>

204
00:23:30.313 --> 00:23:33.024
<i>Go and dump them."</i>

205
00:23:33.232 --> 00:23:34.734
<i>"Dump?"</i>

206
00:23:34.901 --> 00:23:36.444
<i>"Yes, dump."</i>

207
00:23:36.611 --> 00:23:38.404
<i>"Where?"</i>

208
00:23:38.571 --> 00:23:44.744
<i>"How should I know?
Out there, near that bright light.</i>


209
00:23:44.911 --> 00:23:47.580
<i>That's where they're dumped."</i>

210
00:23:53.836 --> 00:23:58.007
<i>So I drive all the way back.</i>

211
00:23:58.174 --> 00:24:02.970
<i>I had never seen an open wound
or any kind of bleeding before.</i>


212
00:24:03.137 --> 00:24:05.431
<i>Now I was in command of a tank...</i>

213
00:24:05.598 --> 00:24:10.687
<i>...full of the dead and wounded,
looking for a bright light, salvation.</i>


214
00:24:18.277 --> 00:24:21.406
What should we do?
Why don't you tell us what to do?


215
00:24:21.906 --> 00:24:23.950
- Shoot.
- At who?


216
00:24:24.117 --> 00:24:26.035
How do I know? Just shoot.

217
00:24:26.202 --> 00:24:29.872
- Isn't it better to pray?
- Then pray and shoot.


218
00:24:41.634 --> 00:24:45.847
<i>Finally we see the helicopter lights.
Like halos.</i>


219
00:24:46.013 --> 00:24:50.977
<i>As we get closer to the light, we see
dead and wounded everywhere.</i>


220
00:25:26.012 --> 00:25:31.267
<i>We unload mechanically,
as if we're not even present.</i>


221
00:25:31.434 --> 00:25:34.228
<i>Then we turn around and drive off.</i>

222
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.800
On the first day of the war...

223
00:26:03.966 --> 00:26:06.803
...I transported
the dead and wounded...


224
00:26:06.969 --> 00:26:09.889
...from tanks on the coast road.

225
00:26:11.224 --> 00:26:13.476
I'm looking for people
who were with me.


226
00:26:13.643 --> 00:26:17.063
Could your men
have been among them?


227
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:22.235
It sounds logical.
We were in the coastal area.


228
00:26:22.401 --> 00:26:25.905
In the western sector. 
It's possible.

229
00:26:26.072 --> 00:26:29.951
Do you recognize me here?

230
00:26:32.662 --> 00:26:34.080
No.

231
00:26:35.414 --> 00:26:38.793
I don't recognize myself either.

232
00:26:52.932 --> 00:26:57.353
Crossing the border at Rosh Hanikra
felt like an excursion.


233
00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.105
We took photos...

234
00:26:59.272 --> 00:27:01.566
...we told jokes.

235
00:27:01.732 --> 00:27:06.779
<i>We had time to fool around
before going into action.</i>


236
00:27:07.572 --> 00:27:14.078
<i>Good morning, Lebanon</i>

237
00:27:14.745 --> 00:27:21.127
<i>Good morning, Lebanon</i>

238
00:27:22.044 --> 00:27:28.301
<i>Too much pain to carry on</i>

239
00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:35.516
<i>Good morning, Lebanon</i>

240
00:27:35.683 --> 00:27:41.147
<i>The landscape was beautiful,
trees all around.</i>


241
00:27:41.314 --> 00:27:46.986
<i>A few scattered houses.
A really idyllic pastoral scene.</i>


242
00:27:47.153 --> 00:27:50.615
<i>The slow drive allowed us
to enjoy the scenery.</i>


243
00:27:50.781 --> 00:27:57.622
<i>May your dreams come true</i>

244
00:27:58.372 --> 00:28:05.463
<i>May your nightmares pass</i>

245
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:11.052
<i>Your existence
Is a blessing, Lebanon</i>


246
00:28:11.218 --> 00:28:14.847
<i>In a tank, you always feel really safe.</i>

247
00:28:15.014 --> 00:28:19.977
<i>A tank is a very massive
enclosed vehicle.</i>


248
00:28:20.144 --> 00:28:22.271
<i>Inside the tank...</i>

249
00:28:22.438 --> 00:28:24.482
<i>...we were protected.</i>

250
00:28:27.401 --> 00:28:34.075
<i>You are torn to pieces</i>

251
00:28:34.492 --> 00:28:41.332
<i>You bleed to death in my arms</i>

252
00:28:41.874 --> 00:28:45.044
<i>You bleed to death in my arms</i>

253
00:28:45.336 --> 00:28:48.881
<i>You are the love of my life</i>

254
00:28:49.298 --> 00:28:55.888
<i>Oh, my short, short life</i>

255
00:28:56.305 --> 00:29:01.560
<i>Tear me to pieces</i>

256
00:29:03.646 --> 00:29:06.232
<i>I'm bleeding</i>

257
00:29:10.194 --> 00:29:15.533
Suddenly our commander
stopped responding. We lost contact.


258
00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.493
- Was he beside you?
- Yes.


259
00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:22.498
<i>I saw his head slumped forward.</i>

260
00:29:23.541 --> 00:29:28.295
<i>I went down inside and saw blood,
blood in the tank.</i>


261
00:29:28.462 --> 00:29:34.176
<i>The blood was coming from his neck.</i>

262
00:29:36.846 --> 00:29:38.264
<i>You were next in command?</i>

263
00:29:38.431 --> 00:29:41.183
Yes, I was.

264
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:44.145
But I didn't react immediately.

265
00:29:44.645 --> 00:29:49.942
<i>We just stayed in the tank
without even thinking of firing back.</i>


266
00:29:53.654 --> 00:29:55.614
Two minutes later,
there was an explosion.


267
00:29:55.781 --> 00:29:58.701
Everyone tried to escape
from the tank hysterically...


268
00:30:02.997 --> 00:30:06.459
<i>...without weapons or anything.</i>

269
00:30:06.625 --> 00:30:09.795
<i>Those who stayed inside
were killed in the tank.</i>


270
00:30:16.052 --> 00:30:18.554
<i>I ran as fast as I could...</i>

271
00:30:18.971 --> 00:30:21.640
<i>...in zigzags towards the sea.</i>

272
00:30:41.494 --> 00:30:43.079
<i>My only thought:</i>

273
00:30:43.245 --> 00:30:47.750
"It's over. I'm done for.

274
00:30:47.917 --> 00:30:52.505
They'll be here any minute.
All I can do is wait for the end."


275
00:30:59.053 --> 00:31:03.265
<i>I saw the building from which they
were shooting, and the commander.</i>


276
00:31:03.432 --> 00:31:08.854
<i>I hoped he'd get closer.</i>

277
00:31:35.881 --> 00:31:39.927
<i>I don't know why,
but he started to retreat.</i>


278
00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:56.777
<i>I felt abandoned by our forces.</i>

279
00:32:01.073 --> 00:32:05.744
<i>I imagined how my mother
would react.</i>


280
00:32:05.911 --> 00:32:10.624
<i>We're very close.
I was always like her right hand.</i>


281
00:32:10.791 --> 00:32:15.546
<i>I'm the only one
who helps out at home.</i>


282
00:32:16.547 --> 00:32:18.591
<i>Like the first-born son.</i>

283
00:32:21.427 --> 00:32:26.098
<i>I took a peek.
I saw them chatting, smoking.</i>


284
00:32:26.265 --> 00:32:28.434
<i>I wondered why...</i>

285
00:32:28.767 --> 00:32:31.145
<i>...they didn't notice me.</i>

286
00:32:32.521 --> 00:32:36.775
<i>I peeked a few more times.
I realized that they probably thought...</i>


287
00:32:36.942 --> 00:32:41.906
<i>...that everyone was killed
in the attack.</i>


288
00:32:42.072 --> 00:32:45.451
<i>I decided to wait until dark.</i>

289
00:32:45.618 --> 00:32:48.662
<i>I had a good place to hide.</i>

290
00:32:57.171 --> 00:32:59.632
<i>I don't know why, but I decided...</i>

291
00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.801
<i>...to crawl out to the sea.</i>

292
00:33:07.681 --> 00:33:14.396
<i>I didn't want to stay close to shore,
so I swam quite far out.</i>


293
00:33:15.147 --> 00:33:19.944
<i>When I felt I was far out enough,
I started swimming south.</i>


294
00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:21.153
<i>How was the sea?</i>

295
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:26.408
Really calm, no waves.

296
00:33:26.575 --> 00:33:29.495
I felt calm and at peace.
Just me and the sea.


297
00:33:45.219 --> 00:33:48.931
<i>I felt safe because the sea
was calm and peaceful.</i>


298
00:33:49.098 --> 00:33:52.184
<i>But I was still really afraid...</i>

299
00:33:53.227 --> 00:33:56.563
<i>...that my strength would fail
and I'd drown.</i>


300
00:33:56.730 --> 00:34:02.528
<i>Or maybe someone might spot me
and shoot at me, kill me.</i>


301
00:34:12.621 --> 00:34:17.543
<i>While swimming through
this peaceful water...</i>


302
00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:21.171
<i>...I suddenly heard a loud noise.</i>

303
00:34:21.338 --> 00:34:23.549
<i>I felt the water pulsating.</i>

304
00:34:23.716 --> 00:34:28.595
<i>I felt the turbulent water
enveloping me.</i>


305
00:34:28.762 --> 00:34:30.764
<i>My body shook with fear.</i>

306
00:35:02.296 --> 00:35:07.009
<i>I saw lights in the distance
and I headed in that direction.</i>


307
00:35:07.176 --> 00:35:10.095
<i>They might be Israeli forces.</i>

308
00:35:10.262 --> 00:35:14.516
<i>I kept swimming,
but felt my strength was dwindling.</i>


309
00:35:14.683 --> 00:35:17.353
<i>I could barely move my limbs.</i>

310
00:35:28.697 --> 00:35:33.452
<i>Sometimes I simply
let the water carry me along.</i>


311
00:35:41.919 --> 00:35:44.755
<i>I eventually reached shore
and started walking.</i>


312
00:35:44.922 --> 00:35:50.302
<i>I heard voices speaking Hebrew
on the two-way radio.</i>


313
00:35:50.469 --> 00:35:53.639
<i>I knew...</i>

314
00:35:53.806 --> 00:35:57.976
<i>...that I had to get to them
despite my exhaustion.</i>


315
00:36:05.651 --> 00:36:10.114
<i>To my amazement, it was
the regiment that had abandoned me.</i>


316
00:36:13.826 --> 00:36:17.830
After I got back to my regiment...

317
00:36:17.996 --> 00:36:20.207
...I felt like....

318
00:36:22.126 --> 00:36:25.504
Like it was me who had
abandoned my comrades.


319
00:36:25.671 --> 00:36:29.883
I always felt
that they regarded me like....


320
00:36:32.928 --> 00:36:37.307
<i>Like someone who didn't help
rescue his friends.</i>


321
00:36:37.474 --> 00:36:44.189
<i>As if I had fled the battlefield
just to save my own skin.</i>


322
00:36:44.356 --> 00:36:46.859
<i>I sometimes felt very uneasy.</i>

323
00:36:47.025 --> 00:36:49.278
<i>I broke off contact
with the families of the dead.</i>


324
00:36:49.445 --> 00:36:56.618
At first I visited their graves,
but then I just stopped.


325
00:36:56.785 --> 00:37:01.206
I wanted to forget.
I didn't want to relive those moments.


326
00:37:02.249 --> 00:37:06.670
<i>- Visiting the graves, you felt....
- Guilty.</i>


327
00:37:06.837 --> 00:37:10.549
<i>I felt guilty standing at their graves.</i>

328
00:37:10.716 --> 00:37:13.260
As if I didn't do enough.

329
00:37:13.719 --> 00:37:15.304
<i>I didn't do enough.</i>

330
00:37:15.471 --> 00:37:21.727
<i>I wasn't the hero type who carries
weapons and saves everyone's life.</i>


331
00:37:21.894 --> 00:37:25.481
<i>That's not me. 
I'm not the type.</i>

332
00:38:02.851 --> 00:38:06.188
<i>I bombed Sidon today</i>

333
00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:12.694
<i>Amid the clouds of smoke at dawn</i>

334
00:38:13.278 --> 00:38:17.741
<i>I almost went home in a coffin</i>

335
00:38:18.659 --> 00:38:21.954
<i>I bombed Sidon today</i>

336
00:38:26.708 --> 00:38:30.128
<i>One month after Ronny Dayag
swam back home safely...</i>


337
00:38:30.295 --> 00:38:34.216
<i>...the army took the beach
from which he had fled.</i>


338
00:38:34.383 --> 00:38:38.220
<i>They told us we'd soon attack Beirut
and that we'd all die.</i>


339
00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:43.475
<i>But on the beach,
we didn't think much about death.</i>


340
00:38:43.642 --> 00:38:46.144
<i>I had a hut of banana leaves.</i>

341
00:38:46.311 --> 00:38:48.397
<i>Thinking back...</i>

342
00:38:48.564 --> 00:38:54.653
<i>...the smell of patchouli oil
still makes me nauseous.</i>


343
00:38:55.195 --> 00:39:00.158
<i>It was really popular in the '80s.
For my roommate Frenkel...</i>


344
00:39:00.325 --> 00:39:06.206
<i>...patchouli was not just a fragrance,
it was a way of life.</i>


345
00:39:35.027 --> 00:39:37.029
Patchouli. How do you use it?

346
00:39:38.405 --> 00:39:39.865
Show me.

347
00:39:41.283 --> 00:39:45.787
You sprinkle a drop on your hand,
like this.


348
00:39:54.046 --> 00:39:55.422
This way...

349
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:58.925
...your comrades
always know you're there.


350
00:39:59.092 --> 00:40:03.013
I remember my men telling me:

351
00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:08.226
"Frenkel, you walk too fast.
Like a rabbit."


352
00:40:10.896 --> 00:40:14.524
<i>So what do you do? 
Patchouli.</i>

353
00:40:14.691 --> 00:40:18.487
<i>In the dark, at night....
They couldn't miss me.</i>


354
00:40:18.654 --> 00:40:22.824
<i>The scent is really strong,
even out in the field.</i>


355
00:40:23.617 --> 00:40:25.077
I still use it.

356
00:40:27.204 --> 00:40:30.749
<i>I bombed Beirut today</i>

357
00:40:32.542 --> 00:40:36.546
<i>I bombed Beirut every day</i>

358
00:40:37.673 --> 00:40:42.511
<i>If I came close to death
I couldn't say</i>


359
00:40:43.261 --> 00:40:46.264
<i>I bombed Beirut every day</i>

360
00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:51.937
<i>At the pull of a trigger</i>

361
00:40:53.605 --> 00:40:56.983
<i>We can send strangers
Straight to hell</i>


362
00:40:59.027 --> 00:41:03.407
<i>Sure, we kill some innocent
Along the way</i>


363
00:41:04.366 --> 00:41:08.787
<i>If I came close to death
I couldn't say</i>


364
00:41:09.705 --> 00:41:12.374
<i>I bombed Beirut every day</i>

365
00:41:13.792 --> 00:41:17.295
<i>Our daily routine was this:</i>

366
00:41:17.462 --> 00:41:19.131
<i>Get up in the morning...</i>

367
00:41:20.298 --> 00:41:25.011
<i>...prepare breakfast
on those frying pans...</i>


368
00:41:25.178 --> 00:41:27.472
<i>...potted beef and eggs.</i>

369
00:41:27.806 --> 00:41:30.475
<i>- On the beach.
- On the beach.</i>


370
00:41:30.642 --> 00:41:31.727
<i>Take a quick swim...</i>

371
00:41:32.102 --> 00:41:35.981
<i>...back into uniform,
then go after some terrorists.</i>


372
00:43:03.527 --> 00:43:05.570
<i>Someone yelled, "Frenkel!"</i>

373
00:43:07.572 --> 00:43:09.908
I noticed a boy holding an RPG.

374
00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.202
<i>A kid.</i>

375
00:43:25.423 --> 00:43:27.592
Frenkel, was I there too?

376
00:43:28.009 --> 00:43:32.973
Sure. From training camp,
you were with me wherever I went.


377
00:43:33.306 --> 00:43:36.017
- Even there?
- Yes, there too.


378
00:43:36.351 --> 00:43:39.980
Good to know.
Of course I was there.


379
00:43:41.106 --> 00:43:45.277
Is it possible that I can't remember
such a dramatic event?


380
00:43:45.694 --> 00:43:47.404
We call them dissociative events.

381
00:43:48.947 --> 00:43:52.576
It's when a person is in a situation
but feels outside it.


382
00:43:52.742 --> 00:43:56.872
I was once visited by a young man,
an amateur photographer.


383
00:43:57.038 --> 00:44:01.167
I asked him in 1983, "How did you
survive through that grueling war?"


384
00:44:01.334 --> 00:44:05.755
He replied, "It was quite easy.
I regarded it as a long day trip."


385
00:44:05.922 --> 00:44:09.676
He told himself,
"Wow, what great scenes:


386
00:44:09.843 --> 00:44:13.096
Shooting, artillery,
wounded people, screaming...."


387
00:44:13.263 --> 00:44:18.310
He looked at everything
as if through an imaginary camera.


388
00:44:31.865 --> 00:44:34.993
<i>Then something happened:</i>

389
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.621
<i>His camera broke.</i>

390
00:44:50.133 --> 00:44:53.094
<i>He said that the situation
turned traumatic for him...</i>


391
00:44:53.261 --> 00:44:58.141
<i>...when they arrived in the vicinity
of the stables in Beirut.</i>


392
00:44:58.308 --> 00:44:59.643
<i>The Hippodrome.</i>

393
00:44:59.809 --> 00:45:03.855
<i>He saw a huge number
of carcasses...</i>


394
00:45:04.022 --> 00:45:08.109
<i>...of slaughtered Arabian horses.</i>

395
00:45:08.276 --> 00:45:13.865
<i>"It broke my heart," he said.
"What had those horses done...</i>


396
00:45:14.032 --> 00:45:16.368
<i>...to deserve such suffering?"</i>

397
00:45:16.534 --> 00:45:20.330
<i>He couldn't handle seeing
those dead and wounded horses.</i>


398
00:45:20.497 --> 00:45:23.375
<i>He had used a mechanism
to remain outside events...</i>


399
00:45:23.541 --> 00:45:27.295
<i>...as if watching the war on film
instead of participating.</i>


400
00:45:27.462 --> 00:45:29.798
<i>This protected him.</i>

401
00:45:29.965 --> 00:45:35.053
<i>Once pulled into the events,
he could no longer deny reality.</i>


402
00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:39.015
<i>Horror surrounded him
and he freaked out.</i>


403
00:45:46.481 --> 00:45:50.568
You told me earlier that you can't
remember being in the orchard...


404
00:45:50.735 --> 00:45:53.905
...where the boy with the RPG was.

405
00:45:54.072 --> 00:45:57.492
Can you remember other things?
Like going home...


406
00:45:57.659 --> 00:46:00.578
...chatting with friends,
events from that time...


407
00:46:00.745 --> 00:46:05.041
...something that maybe
reminds you of that time?


408
00:46:05.208 --> 00:46:08.420
- Yes, in detail.
- For example?


409
00:46:08.586 --> 00:46:11.423
I can remember perfectly
every furlough.


410
00:47:01.598 --> 00:47:06.061
<i>I remember when I was about 10,
there was a war going on.</i>


411
00:47:06.227 --> 00:47:09.439
<i>And everything came to a halt.
All the fathers were at the front.</i>


412
00:47:09.606 --> 00:47:14.027
<i>All children sat with their mothers,
closed up indoors...</i>


413
00:47:14.194 --> 00:47:17.113
<i>...behind closed blinds in the dark.</i>

414
00:47:17.489 --> 00:47:21.993
<i>Just waiting for a plane
to drop a bomb and kill them all.</i>


415
00:47:22.744 --> 00:47:26.164
<i>No one even dreamed
of going outside.</i>


416
00:47:27.123 --> 00:47:32.003
<i>When I went home from Lebanon
for the first time in six weeks...</i>


417
00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:35.632
<i>...I saw that life
was carrying on normally.</i>


418
00:47:47.685 --> 00:47:52.899
<i>My goal on leave
was to get back my girlfriend, Yaeli.</i>


419
00:47:53.066 --> 00:47:56.361
<i>She had dumped me the night before
all of this started.</i>


420
00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:21.344
Remember how?
Add some Sprite.


421
00:48:21.511 --> 00:48:23.263
Ready?

422
00:48:28.268 --> 00:48:29.894
Bottoms up!

423
00:48:33.314 --> 00:48:35.441
The memories are coming back.

424
00:48:35.608 --> 00:48:40.655
I met people who served with me.
I almost have the full picture.


425
00:48:41.072 --> 00:48:44.117
- At which point?
- The first day of the war...


426
00:48:44.534 --> 00:48:46.911
...the siege on Beirut.

427
00:48:47.078 --> 00:48:49.414
You remember that
Yaeli dumped you a week before?


428
00:48:50.331 --> 00:48:52.750
How do you know?

429
00:48:55.336 --> 00:48:58.715
Didn't you know that
I was in love with her for years?


430
00:49:00.758 --> 00:49:03.845
No, I didn't know that.

431
00:49:04.012 --> 00:49:05.680
It's true.

432
00:49:07.599 --> 00:49:10.101
What's wrong?
That was 20 years ago.


433
00:49:10.268 --> 00:49:13.605
It's okay. I'm not angry.

434
00:49:15.857 --> 00:49:18.776
At least you had your home,
your family.


435
00:49:18.943 --> 00:49:22.780
What home? What family?

436
00:49:22.947 --> 00:49:24.449
You have no idea.

437
00:49:24.616 --> 00:49:25.658
My father....

438
00:49:26.451 --> 00:49:32.207
To comfort me,
he told me that in his war...


439
00:49:32.373 --> 00:49:34.459
...World War Il...

440
00:49:34.626 --> 00:49:36.461
...Russian soldiers in Stalingrad...

441
00:49:36.628 --> 00:49:39.881
...were given 48 hours' leave
only after one year on the front.


442
00:49:49.307 --> 00:49:54.729
<i>They got on a train,
arrived home at the station...</i>


443
00:49:55.063 --> 00:49:57.440
<i>...kissed their girlfriends
on the platform...</i>


444
00:49:57.607 --> 00:50:02.153
<i>...then had to get back on board
to head back to the front.</i>


445
00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:04.280
<i>Understand?</i>

446
00:50:07.325 --> 00:50:12.247
He thought it would comfort me.
In fact, he was right.


447
00:50:12.413 --> 00:50:16.000
After only 24 hours,
I was called back to duty.


448
00:50:16.167 --> 00:50:19.379
Back then, a new trend started:
car bombs.


449
00:50:19.796 --> 00:50:21.673
Still popular today.

450
00:50:21.839 --> 00:50:24.342
They're a blast.

451
00:50:24.717 --> 00:50:26.886
A real blast.

452
00:50:27.345 --> 00:50:33.685
So I arrive at this villa
on the outskirts of Beirut.


453
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:41.859
<i>Everything is made of gold.</i>

454
00:50:42.026 --> 00:50:46.781
<i>Fancy sinks, marble,
gold fixtures and all that stuff.</i>


455
00:50:48.366 --> 00:50:53.204
<i>An officer sits in front of the TV.
He doesn't look at me.</i>


456
00:50:53.371 --> 00:50:54.580
<i>He keeps repeating:</i>

457
00:50:54.747 --> 00:50:57.292
Fast forward.

458
00:50:57.667 --> 00:50:59.294
Fast forward.

459
00:50:59.961 --> 00:51:01.379
THE PLUMBER COMES 2

460
00:51:01.546 --> 00:51:06.884
<i>- I'm here to check your plumbing.
- Down here.</i>


461
00:51:11.472 --> 00:51:14.559
<i>- Have you seen my tool?
- Which tool?</i>


462
00:51:14.726 --> 00:51:16.394
<i>The big, long one.</i>

463
00:51:20.189 --> 00:51:21.983
<i>Your pipes are so deep.</i>

464
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:23.318
Fast forward.

465
00:51:34.912 --> 00:51:36.622
Stop.

466
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:41.085
<i>Hello.
Is that your red Mercedes outside?</i>


467
00:51:41.252 --> 00:51:45.089
<i>I'm busy servicing a customer.</i>

468
00:51:48.426 --> 00:51:51.387
<i>He changes the tape and says:</i>

469
00:51:51.554 --> 00:51:55.433
We received a tip-off
about a red Mercedes.


470
00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.061
- It's coming to blow up your men.
- So?


471
00:51:58.227 --> 00:52:00.229
Blow it up first.

472
00:52:00.396 --> 00:52:03.983
- Every red Mercedes?
- Are you an idiot?


473
00:52:04.609 --> 00:52:07.111
Did the Mercedes come?

474
00:52:07.278 --> 00:52:12.950
We waited all night
for the exploding Mercedes...


475
00:52:13.117 --> 00:52:15.953
...for this impending disaster.

476
00:52:53.074 --> 00:52:58.454
<i>Then, in the middle of the night,
the phone rang.</i>


477
00:52:59.247 --> 00:53:00.873
Bashir is dead.

478
00:53:02.083 --> 00:53:03.584
- Which Bashir?
<i>- Bashir Gemayel...</i>


479
00:53:04.001 --> 00:53:06.838
...the elected president of Lebanon.

480
00:53:07.004 --> 00:53:11.426
A brother, an ally, a Christian.
Murdered.


481
00:53:11.968 --> 00:53:16.180
<i>Wake everyone up.
You'll be in Beirut in two hours.</i>


482
00:53:16.681 --> 00:53:20.309
<i>I don't remember much
about the flight to Beirut...</i>


483
00:53:20.476 --> 00:53:24.730
<i>...except that I was having
obsessive thoughts about death...</i>


484
00:53:24.897 --> 00:53:28.901
<i>...because my girlfriend Yaeli
had dumped me the week before.</i>


485
00:53:29.068 --> 00:53:32.447
<i>Death would be my revenge.</i>

486
00:53:32.655 --> 00:53:35.366
<i>She would be ridden with guilt...</i>

487
00:53:35.783 --> 00:53:37.702
<i>...for the rest of her life.</i>

488
00:53:41.622 --> 00:53:44.959
<i>While fantasizing about my death...</i>

489
00:53:45.126 --> 00:53:46.878
<i>...we approach Beirut.</i>

490
00:53:47.336 --> 00:53:50.089
<i>A city with hotels, beaches...</i>

491
00:53:50.256 --> 00:53:52.300
<i>...and people scurrying about.</i>

492
00:53:52.467 --> 00:53:55.553
<i>We land at the international airport.</i>

493
00:53:55.720 --> 00:54:01.309
<i>Our Hercules army helicopter lands
next to jets from Air France, TWA...</i>


494
00:54:01.476 --> 00:54:03.644
<i>...and British Airways.</i>

495
00:54:03.811 --> 00:54:07.648
<i>I was excited
like I was going on a trip abroad...</i>


496
00:54:07.815 --> 00:54:10.985
<i>...excited all over.</i>

497
00:54:18.201 --> 00:54:20.411
<i>At some point I simply take off...</i>

498
00:54:20.578 --> 00:54:23.581
<i>...and walk into the terminal.</i>

499
00:54:23.998 --> 00:54:27.668
<i>It felt as if I
was on a leisure trip...</i>

500
00:54:28.085 --> 00:54:31.339
<i>...a sort of hallucination.</i>

501
00:54:31.506 --> 00:54:33.758
<i>Like standing in a terminal...</i>

502
00:54:33.925 --> 00:54:36.844
<i>...waiting to choose my destination.</i>

503
00:54:37.011 --> 00:54:40.097
<i>Before that '80s departures board...</i>

504
00:54:40.264 --> 00:54:44.268
<i>...the choice is all mine.</i>

505
00:54:44.435 --> 00:54:47.563
<i>I see the 14:10 to London...</i>

506
00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:49.941
<i>...the 15:20 to Paris...</i>

507
00:54:50.107 --> 00:54:52.944
<i>...the 16:00 to New York.</i>

508
00:54:53.736 --> 00:54:58.115
<i>I wander through the terminal
and see the duty-free shops:</i>


509
00:54:58.282 --> 00:55:01.494
<i>Jewelry, tobacco...</i>

510
00:55:01.661 --> 00:55:02.870
<i>...alcohol.</i>

511
00:55:03.037 --> 00:55:07.542
<i>While I'm still on this trip,
I suddenly realize what's going on.</i>


512
00:55:07.708 --> 00:55:11.420
<i>Through the window I see...</i>

513
00:55:11.587 --> 00:55:17.218
<i>...that all the TWA and Air France
planes are just bombed-out shells.</i>


514
00:55:17.635 --> 00:55:19.720
<i>And the shops are empty.</i>

515
00:55:19.971 --> 00:55:21.681
<i>They've long since been looted.</i>

516
00:55:21.847 --> 00:55:26.978
<i>And the schedule board
hasn't changed for months.</i>


517
00:55:28.062 --> 00:55:31.274
<i>Then I start to hear sounds, voices.</i>

518
00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:36.279
<i>I hear shelling in the city
and the bombing by the air force.</i>


519
00:55:36.445 --> 00:55:38.281
<i>Slowly I begin to realize
where I am...</i>


520
00:55:38.447 --> 00:55:41.659
<i>...and I am afraid
of what will happen next.</i>


521
00:55:46.163 --> 00:55:50.459
<i>We start walking
from the airport to the city.</i>


522
00:55:50.626 --> 00:55:53.963
<i>Tall high-rise hotels
hover above us.</i>


523
00:55:54.922 --> 00:55:57.675
<i>The sea is at our side.</i>

524
00:56:04.974 --> 00:56:10.521
<i>We walk along a promenade
towards a large junction.</i>


525
00:56:11.647 --> 00:56:17.528
<i>Then we come under sniper fire
from the upper floors of a hotel.</i>


526
00:56:17.695 --> 00:56:23.200
<i>We can't see where it's coming from
or who is shooting.</i>


527
00:56:23.367 --> 00:56:28.539
<i>A wounded soldier was lying at the
junction, but we couldn't get to him.</i>


528
00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:31.208
<i>We were scared to death.</i>

529
00:56:43.721 --> 00:56:46.015
<i>Then, in the middle of this hell...</i>

530
00:56:46.182 --> 00:56:50.770
<i>...that TV correspondent
Ron Ben-Yishai suddenly shows up.</i>


531
00:56:51.395 --> 00:56:56.734
<i>He's walking upright,
dodging bullets like Superman.</i>


532
00:56:56.901 --> 00:57:01.530
<i>Strolling along as if nothing's wrong,
while bullets whiz past him.</i>


533
00:57:01.697 --> 00:57:05.993
<i>In front of him, a terrified cameraman
crawls forward.</i>


534
00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:11.248
<i>Trembling with fear,
he can't see beyond his helmet.</i>


535
00:57:11.624 --> 00:57:13.918
It was a large junction.

536
00:57:15.252 --> 00:57:20.966
One lane led directly
into Hamra Street...


537
00:57:21.133 --> 00:57:24.762
...to the West Beirut district of Hamra.

538
00:57:24.929 --> 00:57:29.100
I remember the sizzling sound,
a sort of hissing noise....


539
00:57:29.266 --> 00:57:33.938
They were firing masses of RPGs,
and it sounded...


540
00:57:34.146 --> 00:57:36.273
<i>...like a Native American
arrow-shooting range.</i>


541
00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:40.277
<i>Before an RPG explodes,
it makes this hissing noise.</i>


542
00:57:42.196 --> 00:57:45.491
<i>You don't hear an explosion...</i>

543
00:57:45.658 --> 00:57:50.121
...but just this hissing,
then the walls shattering.


544
00:57:50.287 --> 00:57:56.877
During all this,
civilians are seen on balconies:


545
00:57:57.044 --> 00:57:59.213
Women, children...

546
00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:04.802
<i>...and old people are watching
as if it were a film.</i>


547
00:58:16.939 --> 00:58:22.862
<i>They are shooting at us
from all directions.</i>


548
00:58:28.159 --> 00:58:31.078
<i>And we can't get across.</i>

549
00:58:31.245 --> 00:58:35.332
Throughout my military service,
I was a MAG shooter.


550
00:58:35.499 --> 00:58:38.252
During my officer's training, I thought:

551
00:58:38.419 --> 00:58:42.423
"You've used a MAG for so long,
why not try something else?"


552
00:58:42.590 --> 00:58:43.716
So they gave me a Galil.

553
00:58:44.508 --> 00:58:51.056
<i>And while they're shooting at us
from all directions...</i>


554
00:58:51.223 --> 00:58:56.854
<i>...I realize that I can't shoot
with the Galil like I could before.</i>


555
00:58:57.021 --> 00:59:01.567
<i>I missed the good old MAG
that I was familiar with.</i>


556
00:59:02.485 --> 00:59:06.655
So I say to Erez,
"Erez, do me a favor.


557
00:59:08.616 --> 00:59:13.162
Give me your MAG.
I won't make it across with the Galil.


558
00:59:13.329 --> 00:59:16.707
Give me your MAG
and we'll cross the street.


559
00:59:16.874 --> 00:59:17.958
I'll shoot better."

560
00:59:19.126 --> 00:59:22.630
<i>He says, "Frenkel, are you nuts?</i>

561
00:59:22.797 --> 00:59:28.344
<i>They're attacking us!
Stop babbling and shoot!"</i>


562
00:59:30.387 --> 00:59:32.807
<i>I finally realize that I must...</i>

563
00:59:32.973 --> 00:59:36.393
...take drastic steps.
I grab him and say:


564
00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:43.901
"Listen, Erez, give me the MAG,
or I'll take it by force."


565
01:00:07.883 --> 01:00:10.094
<i>Whether an eternity
or just a minute...</i>


566
01:00:10.594 --> 01:00:12.972
<i>...there was Frenkel at the junction...</i>

567
01:00:13.138 --> 01:00:16.475
<i>...with bullets flying past him
in every direction.</i>


568
01:00:16.767 --> 01:00:19.645
<i>Instead of crossing the junction...</i>

569
01:00:19.812 --> 01:00:23.107
<i>...I saw him dancing,
as if in a trance.</i>

570
01:00:24.275 --> 01:00:28.279
<i>He cursed the shooters.
Like he wanted to stay there forever.</i>


571
01:00:28.445 --> 01:00:33.033
<i>As if he wanted to show off
his waltz amid the gunfire...</i>


572
01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.662
<i>...with the posters of Bashir
above his head.</i>


573
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:40.165
<i>And Bashir's followers...</i>

574
01:00:40.332 --> 01:00:42.710
<i>...preparing their big revenge
just 200 yards away:</i>


575
01:00:42.877 --> 01:00:47.464
<i>The Sabra and Shatila massacre.</i>

576
01:00:56.807 --> 01:01:00.561
I'm starting to remember.

577
01:01:00.728 --> 01:01:03.856
I've met people, 
I've heard stories.

578
01:01:04.023 --> 01:01:06.400
Stories about myself.

579
01:01:06.567 --> 01:01:08.736
I didn't want to believe them.

580
01:01:10.404 --> 01:01:13.866
So what can't you remember?

581
01:01:14.033 --> 01:01:19.163
The day of the massacre.
I can remember everything else.


582
01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:24.668
I don't understand
why people were so surprised...


583
01:01:24.835 --> 01:01:27.296
...that the Phalangists
carried out the massacre.


584
01:01:27.463 --> 01:01:31.383
I knew all along
how ruthless they were.


585
01:01:35.846 --> 01:01:39.808
During the storming of Beirut,
we were in the slaughterhouse.


586
01:01:39.975 --> 01:01:44.063
- Where?
- The slaughterhouse, that junkyard...


587
01:01:44.229 --> 01:01:49.568
...where they took the Palestinians,
interrogated them, and executed them.


588
01:01:49.735 --> 01:01:52.529
It was like being on an LSD trip.

589
01:02:00.412 --> 01:02:03.624
<i>They carried body parts
of murdered Palestinians...</i>


590
01:02:03.791 --> 01:02:06.377
<i>...preserved in jars of formaldehyde.</i>

591
01:02:08.462 --> 01:02:13.676
<i>They had fingers, eyeballs,
anything you wanted.</i>


592
01:02:18.931 --> 01:02:21.725
<i>And always pictures of Bashir.</i>

593
01:02:22.434 --> 01:02:26.063
<i>Bashir pendants, Bashir watches,
Bashir this, Bashir that.</i>


594
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:32.361
<i>Bashir was to them
what David Bowie was to me.</i>


595
01:02:32.528 --> 01:02:37.741
<i>A star, an idol, a prince, admirable.</i>

596
01:02:38.033 --> 01:02:41.578
<i>I think they even felt
an eroticism for him.</i>


597
01:02:41.745 --> 01:02:43.414
Totally erotic.

598
01:02:44.873 --> 01:02:50.254
Their idol was about to become king.
We were the ones to crown him.


599
01:02:50.421 --> 01:02:52.840
The next day he was murdered.

600
01:02:53.007 --> 01:02:57.386
It was obvious they'd avenge his death
in some perverse way.


601
01:02:57.803 --> 01:03:00.931
It was as if their wife
had been murdered.


602
01:03:01.098 --> 01:03:04.560
This was about family honor,
which runs deep.


603
01:03:07.688 --> 01:03:08.981
Why did you come back?

604
01:03:09.565 --> 01:03:15.779
I'm still having these hallucinations
about the massacre on the beach.


605
01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:18.449
And you're there with me.

606
01:03:58.405 --> 01:04:00.407
You're crazy.

607
01:04:00.574 --> 01:04:02.701
You're obsessed.

608
01:04:02.868 --> 01:04:07.247
Beach? What are you talking about?
Who was on the beach that night?


609
01:04:07.414 --> 01:04:09.917
What beach?

610
01:04:21.011 --> 01:04:24.098
I've reached a dead end.

611
01:04:24.264 --> 01:04:28.852
I can't find anyone
who was with me at the massacre.


612
01:04:29.144 --> 01:04:32.314
No one who was with me...

613
01:04:32.481 --> 01:04:37.486
...has any solid memories
of the days of the massacre.


614
01:04:37.653 --> 01:04:41.031
I only have this one vision.

615
01:04:41.198 --> 01:04:47.037
And Carmi, the only person in my
vision, denies being there with me.


616
01:04:47.204 --> 01:04:49.790
- It's still real.
- It's a vision.


617
01:04:49.957 --> 01:04:53.210
- But it's yours. Shall I explain?
- Yes.


618
01:04:53.377 --> 01:04:58.924
What does the sea symbolize
in dreams? Fear. Feelings.


619
01:04:59.091 --> 01:05:03.929
The massacre frightens you, makes
you uneasy. You were close to it.


620
01:05:04.096 --> 01:05:05.973
That doesn't help me much.

621
01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:11.728
Your interest in the massacre
developed long before it happened.


622
01:05:11.895 --> 01:05:15.065
Your interest in the massacre
stems from another massacre.


623
01:05:15.232 --> 01:05:19.903
Your interest in those camps
is actually about the other camps.


624
01:05:20.070 --> 01:05:21.947
- Were your parents in camps?
- Yes.


625
01:05:22.114 --> 01:05:23.782
- Auschwitz?
- Yes.


626
01:05:24.366 --> 01:05:29.371
So the massacre has been with you
since you were 6.


627
01:05:29.538 --> 01:05:32.416
You lived through the massacre
and those camps.


628
01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:38.130
Your only solution
is to find out what really happened...


629
01:05:38.297 --> 01:05:41.800
...in Sabra and Shatila.
Seek out people.


630
01:05:41.967 --> 01:05:45.137
Find out what really happened,
ask who was there.


631
01:05:45.304 --> 01:05:48.515
Get details and more details.
That way....


632
01:05:50.475 --> 01:05:54.771
Then maybe you can find out
where you were exactly...


633
01:05:54.938 --> 01:05:57.232
...and what role you played.

634
01:06:05.949 --> 01:06:11.455
<i>On that day, we were sent
to a certain post.</i>


635
01:06:11.622 --> 01:06:14.708
It was actually on a hill.
This hill...


636
01:06:16.084 --> 01:06:19.630
...was opposite the western sector
of the refugee camp.


637
01:06:20.005 --> 01:06:25.969
<i>From where I was,
I could see the settlement houses.</i>


638
01:06:26.136 --> 01:06:28.847
<i>There was occasional shooting.
We tried to locate them...</i>


639
01:06:29.014 --> 01:06:30.891
<i>...and retaliate.</i>

640
01:06:35.771 --> 01:06:38.649
<i>The Christian Phalangist forces
began to arrive.</i>


641
01:06:38.815 --> 01:06:42.319
<i>In full kit,
soldiers in Israeli uniforms...</i>


642
01:06:42.486 --> 01:06:44.988
<i>...took position behind tanks.</i>

643
01:06:46.281 --> 01:06:51.245
<i>I was called for a briefing.
It was in English.</i>


644
01:06:51.411 --> 01:06:53.247
<i>What was it about?</i>

645
01:06:53.413 --> 01:06:55.916
They told us that the Christians...

646
01:06:56.083 --> 01:06:59.586
...would enter the camp
and we would give them cover.


647
01:07:00.212 --> 01:07:03.715
<i>Once they had purged the camps...</i>

648
01:07:03.882 --> 01:07:06.343
...we would seize control.

649
01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:09.388
- Purged of what?
- Palestinian terrorists.


650
01:08:00.439 --> 01:08:04.526
<i>The next morning,
they began to bring out civilians.</i>


651
01:08:10.907 --> 01:08:16.330
<i>The civilians were led
out of the camps...</i>


652
01:08:16.496 --> 01:08:20.625
<i>...in a long line.</i>

653
01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:24.546
<i>The Phalangists watched on,
constantly shouting at them...</i>


654
01:08:24.713 --> 01:08:27.299
<i>...and occasionally firing into the air.</i>

655
01:08:28.383 --> 01:08:30.427
<i>There were women, old people...</i>

656
01:08:30.594 --> 01:08:35.932
<i>...and children walking in a line
towards the stadium.</i>


657
01:08:37.351 --> 01:08:43.774
From inside the tank, did you
wonder where they were taking them?


658
01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:46.109
Did you think about it?

659
01:08:47.194 --> 01:08:49.696
Not really,
because wherever we went...


660
01:08:49.863 --> 01:08:52.991
...an announcement was made
upon entering a camp.


661
01:08:53.158 --> 01:08:59.122
Civilians were ordered out. Those
remaining were considered rebels.


662
01:08:59.289 --> 01:09:05.003
It seemed quite natural
to say to the residents:


663
01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:08.423
"If you don't want to get hurt,
then come out."


664
01:09:31.446 --> 01:09:36.868
On that day I drove to Docha,
a city on the coast.


665
01:09:37.035 --> 01:09:41.498
It had an Israel Defense Forces
landing field.


666
01:09:42.541 --> 01:09:43.583
<i>On the way...</i>

667
01:09:43.959 --> 01:09:47.504
<i>...many Phalangist
half-track vehicles appeared.</i>


668
01:09:47.671 --> 01:09:53.718
<i>They shouted with joy
as they headed towards the airfield.</i>


669
01:09:53.885 --> 01:09:58.682
At the airfield, 
I met a colonel friend.

670
01:09:58.849 --> 01:10:01.852
<i>He told me:</i>

671
01:10:02.018 --> 01:10:05.355
<i>"Have you heard what's happening
in the refugee camps?"</i>


672
01:10:05.522 --> 01:10:08.358
<i>He had pointed to Sabra and Shatila.</i>

673
01:10:08.525 --> 01:10:11.695
<i>"What's happening?" I asked.</i>

674
01:10:11.862 --> 01:10:17.534
<i>"I didn't witness it myself, but they
say there was a terrible massacre."</i>


675
01:10:17.701 --> 01:10:24.749
Palestinians were slaughtered.
I heard they put them on trucks.


676
01:10:24.916 --> 01:10:29.880
<i>I was told that crucifixes
were carved on their chests.</i>


677
01:10:30.046 --> 01:10:35.093
<i>There were wounded,
some in critical condition.</i>


678
01:10:35.469 --> 01:10:38.680
They were put on trucks
and taken to an unknown destination.


679
01:10:48.106 --> 01:10:51.776
We saw a Phalangist soldier...

680
01:10:51.943 --> 01:10:54.905
<i>...taking an old man away.</i>

681
01:10:57.407 --> 01:11:01.453
<i>At some point, we heard shots.</i>

682
01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:03.997
<i>We heard shots.</i>

683
01:11:04.498 --> 01:11:07.918
<i>Then the soldier came out alone.</i>

684
01:11:08.084 --> 01:11:12.214
<i>We asked him what happened.</i>

685
01:11:12.422 --> 01:11:19.179
<i>We couldn't hear him,
but his gestures meant "boom!"</i>


686
01:11:19.346 --> 01:11:24.100
<i>We understood that he'd told the man
to kneel down before him.</i>


687
01:11:24.267 --> 01:11:27.604
<i>When he refused, he shot his knees.
When he refused again...</i>


688
01:11:27.771 --> 01:11:29.564
<i>...he shot him
in the stomach and head.</i>


689
01:11:33.318 --> 01:11:37.364
Didn't you ever realize...

690
01:11:37.531 --> 01:11:42.035
...that trucks were going in empty
and coming out full?


691
01:11:42.202 --> 01:11:47.290
Women and children were brought out
and bulldozers went in?


692
01:11:47.457 --> 01:11:49.209
That maybe
a massacre is taking place?


693
01:11:49.376 --> 01:11:53.922
Did you wonder
why you didn't realize earlier?


694
01:11:55.048 --> 01:11:57.801
Yes, of course.

695
01:11:58.051 --> 01:12:04.349
I realized something was happening
only when my men told me.


696
01:12:04.558 --> 01:12:06.810
<i>From the top of their tanks...</i>

697
01:12:06.977 --> 01:12:11.982
<i>...they started shouting,
"They are shooting people!"</i>


698
01:12:24.369 --> 01:12:29.291
<i>They claim that people were lined up
against the wall and shot.</i>


699
01:12:29.499 --> 01:12:34.045
So I called my commanding officer.

700
01:12:34.212 --> 01:12:39.301
I told him what I heard
was going on in the camps.


701
01:12:39.843 --> 01:12:44.598
He said, "We know about it.
It's under control. We reported it."


702
01:12:44.764 --> 01:12:49.352
As far as I was concerned,
the army was handling it.


703
01:12:49.519 --> 01:12:54.190
Where was the operations room,
the headquarters?


704
01:12:54.357 --> 01:12:58.528
About 100 yards away.
On top of a very tall building.


705
01:12:58.987 --> 01:13:03.116
<i>- How tall?
- Tall enough to see everything.</i>


706
01:13:03.283 --> 01:13:07.078
<i>They surely had a better view
than I did.</i>


707
01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:37.233
<i>I didn't want to walk around at night,
so I drove...</i>


708
01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:41.029
<i>...to my place in Baabda.
I had an apartment in Beirut.</i>


709
01:13:41.196 --> 01:13:46.409
<i>Micha Friedman was with me.
We decided to make dinner.</i>


710
01:13:46.576 --> 01:13:53.750
<i>Micha invited the guys from
the regiment of the 21 1th Brigade.</i>


711
01:13:53.917 --> 01:13:58.630
<i>During the meal, the regiment
commander took me aside.</i>


712
01:13:59.089 --> 01:14:02.092
<i>He said, "Ron...</i>

713
01:14:02.258 --> 01:14:08.181
<i>...my men say there's a massacre
going on in the camps."</i>


714
01:14:08.348 --> 01:14:12.102
He mentioned one or two incidents...

715
01:14:12.268 --> 01:14:14.813
...saying a family was seen shot.

716
01:14:14.979 --> 01:14:18.692
I asked him again,
"Did you see it yourself?"


717
01:14:18.858 --> 01:14:22.696
"I didn't," he said,
"but my soldiers told me about it.


718
01:14:22.862 --> 01:14:28.868
The officers sitting here did too."
We talked about it over dinner later.


719
01:14:29.369 --> 01:14:34.499
<i>As soon as they left at 11:30 p.m...</i>

720
01:14:34.708 --> 01:14:39.796
<i>...I knocked back a whiskey and
phoned Defense Minister Arik Sharon.</i>


721
01:14:40.714 --> 01:14:42.841
<i>At his ranch.</i>

722
01:14:43.007 --> 01:14:47.137
Arik was half asleep.

723
01:14:47.303 --> 01:14:53.560
I said, "I've heard
there's a massacre going on, Arik.


724
01:14:53.727 --> 01:14:59.315
They are slaughtering Palestinians.
We have to put a stop to it."


725
01:14:59.482 --> 01:15:03.653
He asked me,
"Did you see it yourself?"


726
01:15:04.612 --> 01:15:11.119
"No", I said, "but there are
several witnesses who saw it."


727
01:15:11.286 --> 01:15:13.329
"Okay," he said.

728
01:15:13.496 --> 01:15:17.167
"Thanks for bringing it
to my attention." That was all.


729
01:15:17.333 --> 01:15:21.504
<i>You'd normally say, "I'll check it out,
I'll look into it." But no!</i>


730
01:15:21.671 --> 01:15:27.594
<i>He said, "Thanks for bringing it
to my attention. Happy New Year."</i>


731
01:15:27.761 --> 01:15:31.347
<i>Well, something along those lines.
Then back to sleep.</i>


732
01:15:31.514 --> 01:15:34.601
It's amazing.
A massacre took place...


733
01:15:34.768 --> 01:15:39.564
...it was carried out by
Christian Phalangists.


734
01:15:40.565 --> 01:15:45.695
All around were several circles
of our soldiers.


735
01:15:46.446 --> 01:15:49.365
Every circle had some information.

736
01:15:49.532 --> 01:15:52.452
The first one had the most.
However...


737
01:15:52.702 --> 01:15:55.622
...the penny didn't drop.

738
01:15:55.789 --> 01:15:58.541
They didn't realize
they were witnessing a genocide.


739
01:15:58.708 --> 01:16:00.460
What circle were you in?

740
01:16:00.627 --> 01:16:03.421
In the second or third.

741
01:16:03.588 --> 01:16:06.716
What did you do?

742
01:16:08.384 --> 01:16:12.263
<i>We stood on a roof
and saw the sky was lit up.</i>


743
01:16:12.847 --> 01:16:16.643
<i>- With what?
- Flares.</i>


744
01:16:16.810 --> 01:16:20.730
<i>Flares that must have helped them
do what they were doing.</i>


745
01:16:27.237 --> 01:16:29.405
<i>Did you fire the flares?</i>

746
01:16:29.572 --> 01:16:31.115
<i>Is that important?</i>

747
01:16:31.282 --> 01:16:34.911
Does it make any difference
if I fired them...


748
01:16:35.078 --> 01:16:39.249
...or if I just saw the flares
that helped people shoot others?


749
01:16:41.251 --> 01:16:45.255
In your state of mind at that time,
it didn't really make a difference.


750
01:16:45.421 --> 01:16:49.509
You can't remember the massacre
because in your opinion...


751
01:16:49.676 --> 01:16:54.389
...the murderers and those
around them are the same circle.


752
01:16:54.556 --> 01:16:57.684
You felt guilty at the age of 19.

753
01:16:57.851 --> 01:17:00.186
Unwillingly,
you took on the role of the Nazi.


754
01:17:00.395 --> 01:17:05.066
You were there firing flares,
but you didn't carry out the massacre.


755
01:17:20.456 --> 01:17:26.004
<i>I woke up at 5 or 5:30,
and I woke everyone up...</i>


756
01:17:26.170 --> 01:17:28.631
<i>...the whole team.</i>

757
01:17:28.798 --> 01:17:32.635
<i>Then I drove to Sabra and Shatila.</i>

758
01:17:33.386 --> 01:17:35.847
When I arrived there....

759
01:17:36.014 --> 01:17:38.391
What a mess.

760
01:17:39.475 --> 01:17:44.981
You know that picture
from the Warsaw ghetto?


761
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:49.485
The one with the kid
holding his hands in the air?


762
01:17:51.487 --> 01:17:54.157
<i>That's just how
the long line of women...</i>


763
01:17:54.324 --> 01:17:57.827
<i>...old people and children looked.</i>

764
01:17:57.994 --> 01:18:01.956
<i>I thought about going to
Brigadier Amos' headquarters...</i>


765
01:18:02.123 --> 01:18:06.502
<i>...but as I was leaving,
Amos suddenly turned up.</i>


766
01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:08.755
<i>He drove to the head of the convoy.</i>

767
01:18:08.922 --> 01:18:13.509
<i>His angry gestures
forced them to stop.</i>


768
01:18:13.676 --> 01:18:16.930
And that was the end of it.

769
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:19.474
Stop the shooting.

770
01:18:19.641 --> 01:18:21.893
Stop the shooting immediately.

771
01:18:22.769 --> 01:18:25.772
It's an order. 
Stop the shooting...

772
01:18:26.105 --> 01:18:29.943
...immediately. 
Everybody, go home.

773
01:18:30.109 --> 01:18:32.111
Go home, now.

774
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:49.837
<i>The Phalangists
withdrew back up the street.</i>


775
01:18:50.004 --> 01:18:54.884
<i>The women and children
returned to the camp.</i>


776
01:18:55.051 --> 01:18:58.054
<i>- The Palestinians?
- Yes.</i>


777
01:19:05.269 --> 01:19:09.941
I said to my men,
"We're going in with them.


778
01:19:10.108 --> 01:19:11.901
With those women and children.

779
01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:17.573
<i>We'll see what happened in there."</i>

780
01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:21.202
<i>Inside the camp, we saw
a huge amount of rubble.</i>


781
01:19:21.369 --> 01:19:23.162
<i>My eye caught...</i>

782
01:19:23.538 --> 01:19:25.873
<i>...a hand, a small hand.</i>

783
01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:32.338
<i>A child's hand
stuck out from the rubble.</i>


784
01:19:32.588 --> 01:19:37.802
<i>I looked a bit closer and saw curls.</i>

785
01:19:38.594 --> 01:19:44.434
<i>A head of curls covered in dust.
It was hard to make out.</i>


786
01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:51.774
But it was a head,
exposed up to the nose.


787
01:19:52.275 --> 01:19:54.277
A hand and a head.

788
01:19:54.444 --> 01:19:58.698
<i>My own daughter was the same age
as that little girl...</i>


789
01:19:58.865 --> 01:20:03.202
<i>...and she had curly hair too.</i>

790
01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:11.794
<i>The Palestinians in refugee camps
have houses with courtyards.</i>


791
01:20:11.961 --> 01:20:15.131
<i>These courtyards were full
of bodies of women and children.</i>


792
01:20:15.298 --> 01:20:18.426
<i>The young men had been shot first.</i>

793
01:20:18.926 --> 01:20:22.889
<i>Then the rest of the family
was dealt with.</i>


794
01:20:23.639 --> 01:20:27.518
<i>We entered one alley,
a very narrow alley...</i>


795
01:20:27.685 --> 01:20:30.688
<i>...the width of a man and a half.</i>

796
01:20:31.314 --> 01:20:34.525
That alley was full....

797
01:20:34.692 --> 01:20:40.073
Piled up to the height
of a man's chest...


798
01:20:40.239 --> 01:20:42.825
<i>...with the bodies of young men.</i>

799
01:20:42.992 --> 01:20:48.289
<i>That's when I became aware
of the results of the massacre.</i>
