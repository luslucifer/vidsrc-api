00:01:33.788 --> 00:01:37.732
Sometimes, I think about what
we must sound like to God.


2
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.703
How does He know who's
in trouble and needs help?


3
00:01:53.381 --> 00:01:56.316
How did He know to come to us?

4
00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:01.082
What you are about to see is true.

5
00:02:01.618 --> 00:02:04.148
The names have not been changed...

6
00:02:04.226 --> 00:02:07.024
because nobody believes me anyway.

Her father used to be
the reverend here.


37

But he's not anymore.

38
00:03:31.516 --> 00:03:33.152
My daddy is.

39
00:03:34.115 --> 00:03:37.740
That's him... the one holding his head.

He's not looking too happy...

Let the church say, 'Amen.'

56
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.087
Look at this, Osbert.
Ninety-six dollars and a button.


57
00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.477
Button! Who would put a button
in the collection...?

00:04:39.515 --> 00:04:40.501
Oh.

59
00:04:42.258 --> 00:04:43.685
Times are hard, Saul.

60
00:04:44.236 --> 00:04:46.040
The church can't pay its bills on that.

00:04:46.118 --> 00:04:47.710
Amen.

62
00:04:48.915 --> 00:04:52.054
Beloved, in our exploration
of the text today...


63
00:04:53.107 --> 00:04:54.881
I would like to talk to you
about temptation.


64
00:04:55.977 --> 00:04:57.195
Mm-hmm. Amen.

65
00:04:57.371 --> 00:05:00.680
And not just the kind you find in
the liquor store or someone else's bed.


66
00:05:02.243 --> 00:05:04.258
I'm talking about
temptation of the soul.


67
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.533
Mm-hmm.

68
00:05:06.527 --> 00:05:08.762
The kind that just kinda, kinda...

69
00:05:10.032 --> 00:05:11.927
kinda creeps up on you
without you even knowing it.

-But God knows.

75
00:05:31.496 --> 00:05:32.776
He knows you're tired.

76
00:05:34.032 --> 00:05:37.195

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

84
00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:12.149
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you...


85
00:06:12.615 --> 00:06:14.115
thought I needed some help in there.

86
00:06:15.005 --> 00:06:18.372
Well, when I realized you were
doing one of Daddy's old sermons...


87
00:06:19.261 --> 00:06:20.583
I thought maybe you did.

88
00:06:21.609 --> 00:06:22.429
I was...

89
00:06:23.868 --> 00:06:26.442
hoping that he could make
a difference, even if I can't.


90
00:06:30.881 --> 00:06:33.208
If you ask me,
you did even better than he did.


91
00:06:35.292 --> 00:06:36.131
Really.

92
00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.477
I appreciate your support, honey.

93
00:06:42.133 --> 00:06:43.663
Father, forgive me.

94
00:06:46.557 --> 00:06:49.583
I'd like to talk to you
about temptation.


95
00:06:50.027 --> 00:06:52.134
The kind that creeps up on you.

96
00:06:52.873 --> 00:06:55.074
And that's me, Jeremiah.

97
00:06:56.178 --> 00:06:57.740
Are you after Daddy's job already?

98
00:06:57.898 --> 00:07:02.018
Well, this is the story.
My didn't-make-it-up story.


99
00:07:02.286 --> 00:07:04.637
-It was one week before Christmas.
-Come on.


100
00:07:04.989 --> 00:07:08.924
The Christmas
I learned all about miracles.


101
00:07:09.608 --> 00:07:13.725
I asked Santa Claus to bring me
a brother for Christmas.


102
00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:16.999
Well, Santa doesn't make
those kinds of deliveries, baby.


103
00:07:17.367 --> 00:07:18.738
Oh.

104
00:07:19.549 --> 00:07:21.501
Can Hakim have lunch with us?

105
00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:25.716
Well, I think Hakim's grandma
might want him around today, you know?


106
00:07:26.586 --> 00:07:28.994
But he's my best friend.

107
00:07:29.145 --> 00:07:31.742
Well, maybe she won't
miss him for a while.


108
00:07:32.148 --> 00:07:34.601
But then you and I are
going down town, okay?


109
00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:35.821
Okay.

110
00:07:36.132 --> 00:07:38.462
-Be careful crossing the street.
-I will.


111
00:07:38.688 --> 00:07:39.581

00:08:25.634 --> 00:08:28.660
I told you about smoking in the house.
You shouldn't be smoking at all.


133
00:08:28.737 --> 00:08:31.192
Well, there's a lot of things
I shouldn't be doing at all.

-Child Welfare's gonna take him now.
-What?


140
00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:56.614
Julia, they're closing
the youth centre today.


141
00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.210
I have to say good-bye to the kids.

142
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.660
What is his problem?

143
00:09:04.382 --> 00:09:05.914
There is no problem, Ma.

144
00:09:06.522 --> 00:09:08.707
Yeah, and I'm the Queen of the Nile!

145
00:09:09.874 --> 00:09:13.340
Julia, something's been going on
in this house for months now.


146
00:09:13.608 --> 00:09:15.781
I can hear it in your voice
over the phone.


147
00:09:15.851 --> 00:09:17.548
Mom, maybe you've been
dialling the wrong number.


148
00:09:17.648 --> 00:09:18.383
Oh, yeah?

149
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:21.627
Well, somebody just better get
their house in order. That's all I know.


150
00:09:21.957 --> 00:09:24.619

-I'm lookin' at you!


151
00:09:24.693 --> 00:09:27.668
All right. Well, Mama,
you can look at me from behind.


152
00:09:28.564 --> 00:09:33.214
Girl, don't be talkin' to me about
your behind. I gave you that behind!


153
00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:36.861
I don't even know
why I bother wearing this.


154
00:09:36.938 --> 00:09:38.552
It's not doing anyone any good.

155
00:09:41.092 --> 00:09:42.498
And neither am I.

156
00:09:50.484 --> 00:09:51.287
Lord...

157
00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:56.038
I know You're especially busy
this time of year, but...


158
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.470
I'm just a little tired.

159
00:09:59.794 --> 00:10:02.643
If You get a moment,
I sure could use some help.


160
00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:06.566
-Mine's bigger!
-Mine's bigger!


161
00:10:06.627 --> 00:10:09.636
-Mine's much bigger!
-Mine's bigger!


162
00:10:14.047 --> 00:10:17.786
Why did you throw snow at me?
It's all down my neck!


163
00:10:23.222 --> 00:10:24.017
Wow.

164
00:10:24.085 --> 00:10:26.209
-Huh?
-Where'd you come from?


165
00:10:30.415 --> 00:10:31.199
You okay?

166
00:10:32.403 --> 00:10:33.150
No.

167
00:10:34.895 --> 00:10:35.728
You okay?

168
00:10:36.335 --> 00:10:38.941
No. Aaaaaaah!

169
00:10:39.002 --> 00:10:40.913
Hide, run, Hakim, run!

170
00:10:41.106 --> 00:10:43.585
-Wait a... Wait a minute!
-Quick, hurry!


171
00:10:44.438 --> 00:10:47.877
-Here. Hide here.
-I'm here! I'm here!


172
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.439
I'm here!

173
00:10:52.732 --> 00:10:55.034
Thank You, Dear God. Thank You.

174
00:10:57.375 --> 00:10:58.455
I'm here!

175
00:11:00.385 --> 00:11:02.155
-What's he doing?
-Huh?


176
00:11:05.821 --> 00:11:06.839
I'm here!

177
00:11:10.878 --> 00:11:12.518
I'm here!

178
00:11:13.267 --> 00:11:16.980
Ma, it's a snowman. A real one!

179
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.966
Joe Hamilton's tearin' down
everything. Why's he doin' it?


180
00:11:21.141 --> 00:11:22.892
Yeah, man, where're we
supposed to chill at now?


181
00:11:22.953 --> 00:11:25.523
They're tryin' to see us
get locked up or shot or something.


182
00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:29.706
Listen to me, listen. It just means
you've got to work that much harder...


183
00:11:29.767 --> 00:11:31.810
try that much harder
to stay out of trouble.


184
00:11:31.871 --> 00:11:34.567
-I'm gonna do my thing.
-Peace, man.


185
00:11:34.642 --> 00:11:37.431
-I'm sorry.
-Where are we supposed to go now?


186
00:11:38.258 --> 00:11:41.455
-I don't know, man.
-You did your best, pastor.


187
00:11:41.528 --> 00:11:43.054
Yeah, you tried.

188
00:11:43.651 --> 00:11:44.828
Thank you, son.

189
00:11:45.011 --> 00:11:45.757
Bye.

190
00:11:46.032 --> 00:11:48.217
-Y'all take care of yourselves.
-What do you want to do?


191
00:11:48.385 --> 00:11:51.203
-I don't know.
-Well, it's too cold to stay out.


192
00:11:53.887 --> 00:11:54.893
Tough break, huh?

193
00:11:55.935 --> 00:11:57.702
Kinda seems like
they're all tough these days.


194
00:11:59.152 --> 00:12:00.112
You Henry Biggs?

195
00:12:00.465 --> 00:12:03.995
-Yes, I'm the pastor over at St. Matt's.
-Bingo!


196
00:12:04.603 --> 00:12:06.072
Every Friday, 8:00.

197
00:12:07.199 --> 00:12:08.263
My name's Dudley.

198
00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:10.422
Nice to meet you, Dudley. Pleasure.

199
00:12:10.815 --> 00:12:11.656
You a reporter?

200
00:12:11.724 --> 00:12:13.282
-No. No, no.
-Social worker?


201
00:12:14.005 --> 00:12:16.794
-No, I'm here in answer to your request.
-My request?


202
00:12:16.982 --> 00:12:17.698
For help?

203
00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:22.996
Is this some kind of joke?

204
00:12:23.266 --> 00:12:25.662
Uh, no, no. He doesn't make jokes.

205
00:12:26.498 --> 00:12:27.162
He?

206
00:12:35.058 --> 00:12:36.371
Capital 'H', capital 'E'.

207
00:12:36.882 --> 00:12:39.214
I want you to know that
together the three of us...


208
00:12:39.284 --> 00:12:41.379
can help get you through
this little crisis you're having.


209
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.704
-Look, I don't know who you are.
-Dudley, I'm Dudley.


210
00:12:43.765 --> 00:12:45.281
-Or who put you up to this.
-He did.


211
00:12:45.342 --> 00:12:48.512
But I'm afraid you picked
the wrong day for me to be a good sport.


212
00:12:48.586 --> 00:12:50.819
-Now, will you excuse me?
-Sure.


213
00:12:51.962 --> 00:12:52.655
Thank you.

214
00:12:54.075 --> 00:12:54.562
Wow.

215
00:12:56.033 --> 00:12:56.953
I'm sorry.

216
00:12:58.113 --> 00:12:59.094
I'll, uh...

217
00:13:01.712 --> 00:13:02.779
try another approach.

218
00:13:05.252 --> 00:13:09.504
-Ho, ho, ho.
-Thank you, sister. Merry Christmas.


219
00:13:11.033 --> 00:13:12.560
I've been waitin' a long time for this.

220
00:13:12.646 --> 00:13:14.798
-Yeah?
-Yes, sir.


221
00:13:17.522 --> 00:13:19.594
Mmm. Oh, yeah.

222
00:13:20.469 --> 00:13:22.354
Hey, don't that cheese
burn the roof of your mouth?


223
00:13:22.774 --> 00:13:23.615
Hmm?

224
00:13:26.531 --> 00:13:27.120
Um...

225
00:13:32.116 --> 00:13:33.068
Uh, you...

226
00:13:33.814 --> 00:13:34.974
you know Reverend Biggs?

227
00:13:35.685 --> 00:13:36.963
Sure, from St. Matt's.

228
00:13:37.683 --> 00:13:38.575
Yeah, that's the one.

229
00:13:38.636 --> 00:13:39.583
Stubborn, isn't he?

230
00:13:40.563 --> 00:13:42.409
Kinda short with people too.
Didn't you notice?


231
00:13:42.894 --> 00:13:44.128
This man right here?

232
00:13:47.419 --> 00:13:49.042
Not that I know him that well.
I'm just...


233
00:13:49.801 --> 00:13:52.686
He came to the hospital every
day after my wife's surgery.


234
00:13:53.006 --> 00:13:53.648
-Every day?

235
00:13:53.724 --> 00:13:55.677
He baptised all five of my kids.

236
00:13:55.738 --> 00:13:57.347
-All five of them?
-Yeah. Give me this.


237
00:13:57.701 --> 00:14:00.604
-Wait. I didn't mean anything.
-Go on, get on out of here!


238
00:14:02.164 --> 00:14:03.411
You better go. 
Get on outta here.

239
00:14:04.221 --> 00:14:05.110
And don't come back.

240
00:14:06.084 --> 00:14:08.583
I'm telling you, 
Mama, he was there.

241
00:14:08.644 --> 00:14:10.578
Like he fell from the sky.

242
00:14:10.654 --> 00:14:13.316
Then he did a dance and jumped around.

243
00:14:13.557 --> 00:14:15.993
Mommy's gonna stop giving you
sugar cereal in the morning, baby.


244
00:14:16.054 --> 00:14:18.113
-Come on. Who's that?
-Ho, ho, ho.


245
00:14:18.288 --> 00:14:20.322
-Santa Claus!
-Merry Christmas!


246
00:14:20.383 --> 00:14:23.757
Ho, ho, ho, ho. 
Merry Christmas, Santa.

247
00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:25.971
-Thank you, little bro.
-Here, put some money in.


248
00:14:26.974 --> 00:14:30.589
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

249
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.020
-Mmm-mmm-mmm.
-Thank you, sir.


250
00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:34.797
-Merry Christmas.
-Same to you, buddy.


251
00:14:37.307 --> 00:14:39.375
-Osbert! Merry Christmas!
-How've you been, sister?


252
00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:43.420
Shh. Mm-mm.

253
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.777
-Come on, Jeremiah.
-Ho, ho, ho!


254
00:14:46.296 --> 00:14:47.091
Merry Christmas.

255
00:14:47.671 --> 00:14:48.545
Thank you, brother.

256
00:14:48.712 --> 00:14:53.683
God bless Mommy and Daddy
and Grandma and Hakim.


257
00:14:53.744 --> 00:14:54.802
-Amen.
-Amen.


258
00:14:55.518 --> 00:14:57.035
Okay, fella, let's get into bed.

259
00:14:59.715 --> 00:15:01.437
Legs under. Thank you.

260
00:15:02.459 --> 00:15:03.439
All right.

261
00:15:06.463 --> 00:15:09.005
I'm going to be sad when he goes.

262
00:15:09.699 --> 00:15:10.748
We all will.

263
00:15:12.074 --> 00:15:13.467
We'll all miss Hakim.

264
00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:17.556
Will I have to go
live with another family too?


265
00:15:19.209 --> 00:15:20.616
Of course not, Jeremiah.

266
00:15:21.545 --> 00:15:22.463
Of course not.

267
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:27.758
Get some sleep.

268
00:15:28.112 --> 00:15:30.566
I will if you sing to me.

269
00:15:31.488 --> 00:15:32.204
All right.

00:16:25.685 --> 00:16:27.375
Okay, but go to sleep.

280
00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:29.729
-Okay.
-Sweet dreams.


281
00:16:33.728 --> 00:16:35.315
Get down! Get down!

282
00:16:37.659 --> 00:16:38.799
All right, come on!

283
00:16:41.713 --> 00:16:44.345
Come on, let's get in the car.

284
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.604
Pull up the car! Come on!
Let's go! Get in! Go, go, go!


285
00:16:54.202 --> 00:16:56.209
Over here! Over here!

286
00:16:57.697 --> 00:16:59.072
Help me, help me, look!

287
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.907
-Hey, hey, calm down.
-They robbed me! They broke my window!


288
00:17:01.998 --> 00:17:04.657
-That's him over there!
-That's him? Freeze!


289
00:17:04.718 --> 00:17:06.914
-That's him over there.
-Don't shoot.


290
00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:10.577
-Turn around!
-That ain't mine, man. He dropped it.


291
00:17:10.638 --> 00:17:11.672
Get against the wall.

292
00:17:11.866 --> 00:17:14.677
-I was returning a tape, man.
I live right down the street.


293
00:17:14.738 --> 00:17:17.079
That was you.
I saw you break my window!


294
00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.679
-I was at the ATM.
-You have the right to remain silent.


295
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.228
I have the receipt in my pocket!

296
00:17:25.266 --> 00:17:29.794
Billy looked so sad. Why did they have
him in handcuffs? He's not a criminal.


297
00:17:29.871 --> 00:17:33.357
Do you think they'll give him dinner?
He hasn't had anything since lunch.


298
00:17:33.418 --> 00:17:36.012
-I know he's hungry.
-He'll just be there overnight.


299
00:17:36.642 --> 00:17:38.814
His bail hearing will be set
for sometime tomorrow.


300
00:17:39.523 --> 00:17:41.283
Has he ever been in trouble before?

301
00:17:43.009 --> 00:17:44.782
-Two years ago.
-Oh, great!


302
00:17:44.923 --> 00:17:48.809
I was able to get the judge to give him
probation, as long as I found him a job.


303
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.741
-And you did.
-I promised I would straighten him out.


304
00:17:53.082 --> 00:17:54.737
Looks like I didn't
do such a good job.

305
00:17:54.798 --> 00:17:56.732
Oh, no. He's a different kid now.

306
00:17:56.793 --> 00:17:58.529
Watches the little ones
while I'm at work.


307
00:17:58.906 --> 00:18:01.082
I don't know what I'm going to do
if they take him away from me.


308
00:18:01.344 --> 00:18:04.104
-Don't worry. We'll talk tomorrow.
-Thank you.


309
00:18:04.165 --> 00:18:07.390
-Bye.
-Saul, Saul, Saul! Over here!


310
00:18:07.451 --> 00:18:09.453
Look, kids! We don't have to walk.

311
00:18:09.577 --> 00:18:11.635
Come on, kids. 
Come on, kids.

312
00:18:11.711 --> 00:18:14.254
-Henry.
-Let's go. Watch your brother.


313
00:18:15.934 --> 00:18:17.815
No fingerprints on the wind shield,
if you please.


314
00:18:18.509 --> 00:18:20.148
Try to keep the feet
off the seats, too, huh?


315
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.238
All right. Get on, sweetheart.

316
00:18:22.561 --> 00:18:24.802
-Feet on the floor, please.
-They are!


317
00:18:25.058 --> 00:18:27.360
-Me too.
-King Saul's Charter Service.


318
00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.774
We make jail calls.

319
00:18:30.381 --> 00:18:31.173
I appreciate it, Saul.

320
00:18:32.381 --> 00:18:33.010
We all do.

321
00:18:33.667 --> 00:18:35.578
You're a minister, you know.
You're not a social worker.


322
00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:37.383
I'll file a complaint.

323
00:18:38.393 --> 00:18:39.153
See you.

324
00:18:40.464 --> 00:18:43.002
-All right, y'all.
-Everybody sit down, now.


325
00:18:43.156 --> 00:18:45.761
Sit down, put your seat belts on.
Nobody gets carsick, do they?


326
00:18:45.828 --> 00:18:48.289
-I do!
-Just stick your head out that window!


327
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.624
-Go on. It's not that cold out!
-Saul!


328
00:18:51.882 --> 00:18:54.178
What did they give you?
They give you eggs? Oh, no!


329
00:19:11.145 --> 00:19:11.958
Okay.

330
00:19:16.344 --> 00:19:17.629
Come on.

331
00:19:19.722 --> 00:19:20.462
Great.

332
00:19:22.748 --> 00:19:23.480
Lord,

333
00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.739
if You are really up there...

334
00:19:26.945 --> 00:19:27.863
I need some help.

335
00:19:34.727 --> 00:19:35.459
Henry?

336
00:19:36.465 --> 00:19:37.375
You again.

337
00:19:37.436 --> 00:19:37.984
Yep.

338
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.277
What do you want from me now?

339
00:19:41.159 --> 00:19:43.059
Uh, wait. I'm supposed
to ask you that question.


340
00:19:43.272 --> 00:19:46.400
Right now, all I want is
to put my key in the ignition...


341
00:19:46.472 --> 00:19:47.708
turn it and have it...

342
00:19:52.251 --> 00:19:52.842
What else?

343
00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:54.830
Oh, I suppose you think that you...

344
00:19:56.467 --> 00:19:57.368
Who are you?

345
00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:58.749
Really?

346
00:19:59.241 --> 00:20:01.702
All right, but it might be best
if you don't tell anybody else.


347
00:20:02.268 --> 00:20:02.935
No.

348
00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:04.262
No.

349
00:20:04.323 --> 00:20:05.300
My name's Dudley,

350
00:20:05.533 --> 00:20:06.591
as you remember...

351
00:20:06.884 --> 00:20:09.076
when I saw you
at the Youth Centre, and...


352
00:20:10.276 --> 00:20:11.016
I'm an angel.

353
00:20:14.061 --> 00:20:15.032
I beg your pardon?

354
00:20:15.286 --> 00:20:16.805
An angel. You know, like in the Bible?

355
00:20:19.038 --> 00:20:20.324
Of course you are!

356
00:20:20.964 --> 00:20:22.132
The angel Dudley?

357
00:20:22.208 --> 00:20:25.541
♪ Ding ♪ -That must have been
that part of the Bible that got lost.


358
00:20:25.685 --> 00:20:26.973
I knew you wouldn't understand.

359
00:20:27.034 --> 00:20:29.133
I know you don't believe me.
It's hard, even for you.


360
00:20:29.194 --> 00:20:30.621
But angels cannot lie, Henry.

361
00:20:30.682 --> 00:20:31.735
We're not allowed to.

362
00:20:32.241 --> 00:20:33.190
It's in the angel handbook.

363
00:20:33.251 --> 00:20:34.916
-Of course it is.
-I'll show it to you.


364
00:20:34.977 --> 00:20:36.194
No, that's okay. -No,
I'm gonna show you.


365
00:20:36.336 --> 00:20:37.955
-That's okay. -I'm gonna show you.
-Okay, fine.


366
00:20:39.723 --> 00:20:43.228
Thanks for everything. Say hello to
the Big Guy and the Easter Bunny too.


367
00:20:44.045 --> 00:20:45.937
-Wait, wait, wait. Can I exp...
-It's freezing.


368
00:20:46.648 --> 00:20:48.723
-Let's get a cab.
-Can't afford one.


369
00:20:49.333 --> 00:20:50.109
Can I get in?

370
00:20:51.576 --> 00:20:53.150
Yes, it's cold out and...

371
00:20:53.691 --> 00:20:54.463
Get in.

372
00:20:54.892 --> 00:20:56.783
-You've got a good heart, Henry.
-Come on.


373
00:20:57.254 --> 00:20:59.076
-You've got a good heart.
-Yeah, a good heart.


374
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.780
-Are you ready?
-Yes.


375
00:21:07.526 --> 00:21:08.852
Don't draw on the window.

376
00:21:09.937 --> 00:21:12.510
Oh, God. I miss this place, Henry.

377
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:15.594
I had some wonderful times
down here, I tell you.


378
00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:19.454
Oh, I'm not supposed
to go into how I...


379
00:21:19.971 --> 00:21:22.599
Ohh. The seat belt, please.

380
00:21:23.593 --> 00:21:26.240
But, as you can see,
I was cut down in my prime.


381
00:21:26.664 --> 00:21:27.639
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

382
00:21:28.907 --> 00:21:30.812
Ever since then, Henry,
I've been up there...


383
00:21:30.873 --> 00:21:33.119
waitin' in line for a chance
to get sent back down here.


384
00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.567
-It's a long line, too, let me tell you.
-You don't say.


385
00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:36.592
Oh, I do say.

386
00:21:37.288 --> 00:21:40.339
You've got no idea what the competition
is like just to get sent down here.


387
00:21:40.752 --> 00:21:42.297
Everybody wants this job.

388
00:21:42.647 --> 00:21:44.911
I don't know why
He sent me, Henry, but I'm glad He did.


389
00:21:45.001 --> 00:21:45.476
Yeah.

390
00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:47.147
-And I'm going to do
everything I can to help you.


391
00:21:47.271 --> 00:21:48.314
Thank you very much.

392
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.562
-Oh, I need to go over the
rules, if that's okay with you?


393
00:21:51.623 --> 00:21:54.399
-Oh, no, no, no. That's not necessary.
-It'll only take a second, Henry.


394
00:21:55.313 --> 00:21:59.630
Oh, all right. -'Rule Number One: We
can't do anything you should be doing.'


395
00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.623
That makes sense. If I'm doing it,
that'd be two of us, wouldn't it?


396
00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:04.946
Exactly.

397
00:22:05.353 --> 00:22:08.411
'Number Two: Everything you do must
be done of your own free will.'


398
00:22:08.472 --> 00:22:11.806
-Now, that's a biggie.
-Tough, but fair. Are there many more?


399
00:22:12.357 --> 00:22:14.347
Finally, when I leave, when the
mission is accomplished...


400
00:22:14.408 --> 00:22:15.003
-Yes?

401
00:22:15.064 --> 00:22:17.607
-...you won't have any memory of me.
-That's my favourite.


402
00:22:18.151 --> 00:22:21.100
Okay, so I got my rules.
Where can I drop you?


403
00:22:21.585 --> 00:22:23.500
-Uh, how about right here?
-Good.


404
00:22:27.376 --> 00:22:28.317
-See you later, Henry.
-Um...


405
00:22:28.378 --> 00:22:29.991
Uh, ooh, ooh...

406
00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.578
Hold... Wait a minute. Look. If you...

407
00:22:34.631 --> 00:22:36.064
If you really want to talk to me,

408
00:22:36.311 --> 00:22:38.262
my office is always open.

409
00:22:39.084 --> 00:22:40.591
-Just make an appointment.
-Thank you.


410
00:22:41.845 --> 00:22:42.424
Okay.

411
00:22:46.109 --> 00:22:46.766
Feel it?

412
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.922
Kinda like springtime and Mom's
home cooking all rolled into one?


413
00:22:55.452 --> 00:22:56.579
I don't feel a thing.

414
00:22:57.361 --> 00:22:57.916
You will.

415
00:22:59.170 --> 00:22:59.783

469
00:25:44.885 --> 00:25:45.560
Now, Henry,

470
00:25:46.157 --> 00:25:47.583
I know it's none of my business...

471
00:25:47.694 --> 00:25:50.335
I'm glad you realize that, Marguerite.

472
00:25:51.564 --> 00:25:52.610
I'll be in my office.

482
00:26:37.578 --> 00:26:38.850
Need to be now.

483
00:26:39.883 --> 00:26:40.786
This is all I need.

484
00:26:42.914 --> 00:26:45.206
Come on. Careful. Be careful.

485
00:26:45.267 --> 00:26:47.968
Julia, get everyone
out of the building.


486
00:26:48.029 --> 00:26:50.695
Come on, hurry, hurry.
Henry! The boiler!


487
00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.335
-Yeah, I know it.
-Button up, button up.


488
00:26:55.296 --> 00:26:56.997
What do you need? 
Do you need anything?

489
00:27:00.132 --> 00:27:01.396
Careful, Mrs. Havergal.

490
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.510
You've got the devil in
that basement there.


491
00:27:05.571 --> 00:27:08.110
I know, I know.
Don't slip. I got it.

492
00:27:08.171 --> 00:27:09.584
Careful, children, careful.

493
00:27:10.642 --> 00:27:12.741
Oh, no, no!

494
00:27:13.606 --> 00:27:14.608
Look at this.

495
00:27:18.104 --> 00:27:18.822
Aww.

496
00:27:20.314 --> 00:27:21.654
Oh, no.

497
00:27:22.967 --> 00:27:25.062
You could have given us
one more winter.


498
00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:32.205
-Is it open?
-Yes, Jeremiah. I left it open.


499
00:27:32.564 --> 00:27:34.017
-Okay?
-Okay.


500
00:27:34.078 --> 00:27:36.516
-All right. Sleep well.
-Good night, Mommy.


501
00:27:38.322 --> 00:27:39.203
What a night.

502
00:27:40.033 --> 00:27:41.374
I don't even want
to think about tomorrow...


503
00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:44.113
between the boiler and Hakim leaving.

504
00:27:46.247 --> 00:27:47.067
Now, why...

505
00:27:47.727 --> 00:27:49.256
why are they gonna send that boy...

506
00:27:49.317 --> 00:27:51.291
to a foster home so far away?

507
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.230
I knew I should have called...

508
00:27:53.291 --> 00:27:55.691
Honey, you called half
the agencies in the state.


509
00:27:56.246 --> 00:27:57.400
I know, I know.

510
00:27:59.324 --> 00:28:00.995
But maybe the answer
was in the other half.


511
00:28:06.475 --> 00:28:07.750
I'm losing them, Julia.

512
00:28:08.333 --> 00:28:11.527
One by one. Hakim, Saul, Billy...

513
00:28:14.018 --> 00:28:14.751
the youth centre.

514
00:28:16.933 --> 00:28:19.674
I know it's my fault,
but I just can't seem...


515
00:28:19.741 --> 00:28:21.159
You know, honey, I had
some thoughts on...


516
00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.357
Can we do this in the morning?

517
00:28:23.128 --> 00:28:24.082
'Cause I'm beat.

518
00:28:29.581 --> 00:28:30.750
Yeah, the morning's fine.

519
00:28:33.905 --> 00:28:34.820
Good night, Julia.

520
00:28:46.604 --> 00:28:49.548
Yoo-hoo! Mornin'!

521
00:28:49.941 --> 00:28:52.105
Whoo! I brought the mail in.

522
00:28:54.999 --> 00:28:56.228
Anybody wanna open it?

523
00:28:57.807 --> 00:29:00.585
Oh. Well, I'll just take my coat off...

524
00:29:00.646 --> 00:29:02.423
and bring it on into the office, then.

525
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.481
Look, I know things have been tough
around here lately, and that's my fault.


526
00:29:08.047 --> 00:29:09.656
But everything is gonna be all right.

527
00:29:10.689 --> 00:29:12.578
I'm comin'! Ooh! I got it!

528
00:29:13.871 --> 00:29:15.855
Hello? Who?

529
00:29:16.233 --> 00:29:18.055
-Mm-hmm.
-If only saying it made it all right.


530
00:29:19.059 --> 00:29:19.644
Yeah.

531
00:29:19.759 --> 00:29:21.458
You see? If you'd listened,
you'd have heard an apology.


532
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.111
Not a big one, but a start.

533
00:29:23.373 --> 00:29:25.013
-Uh-huh.
-No, what I heard is a man saying...


534
00:29:25.101 --> 00:29:28.400
'How can I deal with this fast enough,
then get on with the rest of my day?'


535
00:29:28.805 --> 00:29:30.710
-You see, that's not fair.
-Oh, it's not fair?


536
00:29:31.136 --> 00:29:32.473
Girl, I'm trying to listen!

537
00:29:35.373 --> 00:29:37.463
Yeah, I'll give him the message.
Uh-huh.


538
00:29:37.626 --> 00:29:40.752
We've got to stop talking around Mama.
She knows too much of our business.


539
00:29:40.924 --> 00:29:41.872
That was Anna Eldridge.

540
00:29:42.525 --> 00:29:44.996
Billy's bail hearing's
been scheduled for 9:30.


541
00:29:45.057 --> 00:29:45.941
9:30!

542
00:29:47.456 --> 00:29:48.773
We'll finish this later, honey.
I promise.


543
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.895
-Are you coming home after?
-Not right after.


544
00:29:51.408 --> 00:29:53.314
-I have to be somewhere at 11:00.
-Joe Hamilton.


545
00:29:53.604 --> 00:29:54.548
Do you mind?

546
00:29:55.707 --> 00:29:56.721
Oh, Henry.

547
00:29:57.361 --> 00:29:59.201
Do I look like I mind?

548
00:30:06.617 --> 00:30:08.578
You ready to talk about this,
little girl?


549
00:30:09.453 --> 00:30:12.751
I don't know what you mean, Mama.
I think things are looking up for us.


550
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:16.465
Mmm-hmm. There goes that behind again.

00:30:43.619 --> 00:30:46.078
I didn't hear you come in!
You waitin' for the pastor?


562
00:30:46.445 --> 00:30:48.149
Yes, yes. My name's Dudley.

563
00:30:49.103 --> 00:30:50.283
-Beverly.
-How are you?


564
00:30:50.344 --> 00:30:52.706
-I'm the pastor's secretary.
-Pleasure to meet you.


565
00:30:52.896 --> 00:30:54.375
You just missed him. 
He went to court.

566
00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.718
-These your children?
-Yeah, that's them.


567

Oh, they're beautiful.

568
00:31:02.416 --> 00:31:05.258
Where was your husband? Taking the picture?
Mmhmm.


569
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:09.506
Then he took the car and the waitress
at the diner and moved to Cleveland.


570
00:31:10.179 --> 00:31:12.695
-Sorry to hear that.
-You have any children?


571
00:31:12.982 --> 00:31:16.484
No, no. Never had a chance
to settle down. I wanted to.


572
00:31:19.858 --> 00:31:21.267
You smell wonderful.

573
00:31:21.847 --> 00:31:22.799
What do you call that?

574
00:31:23.214 --> 00:31:23.968
Soap.

575
00:31:25.159 --> 00:31:27.290
I haven't smelled a woman
in such a long time.


576
00:31:27.476 --> 00:31:29.091
I'll get you a bar for Christmas.

577
00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:30.884
Do you have an appointment?

578
00:31:31.033 --> 00:31:33.891
Uh, no, not exactly. I was...

579
00:31:35.486 --> 00:31:36.591
sent to help the reverend,

580
00:31:37.415 --> 00:31:38.293
like an assistant.

581
00:31:38.568 --> 00:31:39.418
Assistant?

582
00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:41.145
I haven't heard anything about no...

583
00:31:41.982 --> 00:31:42.876
Oh, my Lord!

584
00:31:42.963 --> 00:31:44.118
Am I gettin' fired?

585
00:31:44.179 --> 00:31:45.831
No, no, no. It's just temporary.

586
00:31:45.892 --> 00:31:48.326
Temporary! I ain't heard
nothing about no temporary!


587
00:31:48.387 --> 00:31:50.480
-Well, there's nothing... Uh, look.
-Oh, God.


588
00:31:51.052 --> 00:31:54.385
-Let me get you some coffee.
-Coffee! You made coffee on that machine?


589
00:31:54.637 --> 00:31:57.755
I've been trying for six weeks
to figure out that machine!


590
00:31:57.979 --> 00:32:00.186
My babies need new glasses,
and I'm out of a job!


591
00:32:00.906 --> 00:32:02.998
Look, mister, I have kids.
They're growin' like weeds.


592
00:32:03.059 --> 00:32:05.991
And if you think I get a penny from that
man, you got another thought comin'!


593
00:32:06.052 --> 00:32:07.989
I can't take this! Bein' fired!

594
00:32:08.397 --> 00:32:10.352
Take it easy.
There's nothing to worry about. Here.


595
00:32:10.413 --> 00:32:12.066
Oooh! Oooh!

596
00:32:12.367 --> 00:32:13.571
Look at you. You're crying.

597
00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:16.077
Here, blow, blow.

598
00:32:17.989 --> 00:32:19.542
Oh. I knew that.

599
00:32:21.763 --> 00:32:24.181
Your Honour, my client,
Billy Eldridge...


600
00:32:24.252 --> 00:32:26.311
was sent by his mother
to return a video rental...


601
00:32:26.388 --> 00:32:27.809
It's all here, Miss Chattan.

602
00:32:29.315 --> 00:32:31.718
Well, the Reverend Biggs
is present in the courtroom...


603
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.051
and he is willing to post bail.

604
00:32:34.449 --> 00:32:37.355
This is a serious felony.
Bail is set at $ 25,000.


605
00:32:37.438 --> 00:32:41.033
-Your Honour, I have evidence...
-May I address the court?


606
00:32:41.102 --> 00:32:43.509
I'm turning it over
for grand jury action. Next case.


607
00:32:43.905 --> 00:32:45.479
We love you, Billy. 
He didn't do it.

608
00:32:46.077 --> 00:32:47.040
Clear the court.

609
00:32:47.676 --> 00:32:49.766
$25,000! What am I gonna do?

610
00:32:49.932 --> 00:32:51.183
Would you clear the court?

611
00:32:52.178 --> 00:32:52.942
I'll take care of it.

612
00:32:53.194 --> 00:32:54.009
Next case.

613
00:32:54.623 --> 00:32:56.279
I said, next case!

614
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:59.243
Pending 802, Harley Williamson.

615
00:33:21.369 --> 00:33:22.888
-You could hide.
-Mm-mm.


616
00:33:23.652 --> 00:33:25.769
-Take this. I'll bring him right out.
-Sure. No problem.


617
00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.649
Here. They might starve you.

618
00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.347
Thanks.

619
00:33:45.733 --> 00:33:48.497
Okay, they've got everything.
All ready to go.


620
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.730
Hey, guys!

621
00:33:51.848 --> 00:33:53.500
Hakim, you remember Robbie, don't you?

622
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:55.508
Hakim gets to ride in the train today.

623
00:33:55.576 --> 00:33:56.574
Wow.

624
00:33:57.701 --> 00:33:58.674
A train ride.

625
00:33:59.646 --> 00:34:00.729
We're running a little late.

626
00:34:02.156 --> 00:34:02.996
Okay.

627
00:34:03.423 --> 00:34:08.148
Take care of yourself, okay?
See you soon. Say good-bye, Jer.


628
00:34:08.402 --> 00:34:09.242
Bye.

629
00:34:11.736 --> 00:34:12.489
Take care.

630
00:34:14.113 --> 00:34:15.485
Bye, Hakim. We'll miss you.

631
00:34:17.663 --> 00:34:19.745
Hold on, baby. 
It's cold out here.

632
00:34:28.955 --> 00:34:31.546
Who will I tell my secrets to?

633
00:34:31.646 --> 00:34:33.863
Well, you can phone Hakim
sometimes, okay?


634
00:34:34.013 --> 00:34:36.437
And Mommy'll teach you how to write,
so you can send him letters.


635
00:34:49.649 --> 00:34:50.323
Bye.

636
00:35:11.751 --> 00:35:13.571
I know You have a master plan, but...

637
00:35:15.121 --> 00:35:17.082
sometimes You're just
a little tough to figure.


638
00:35:19.592 --> 00:35:20.614
Jeremiah.

639
00:35:22.095 --> 00:35:24.656
-Jeremiah.
-It's not fair!


640
00:35:26.275 --> 00:35:27.272
Hakim left.

641
00:35:35.451 --> 00:35:36.278
Julia.

642
00:35:40.742 --> 00:35:43.113
This is Dudley,
the reverend's new assistant.


643
00:35:43.271 --> 00:35:47.033
Assistant? He wrote to the church
council months ago for extra help.


644
00:35:47.593 --> 00:35:49.476
Well, the extra help is here.

645
00:35:49.961 --> 00:35:51.008
Oooooh.

646
00:35:52.524 --> 00:35:55.933
But he didn't say anything about getting
a response. Who sent you, exactly?


647
00:35:55.994 --> 00:35:57.511
Uh, the, uh...

648
00:35:59.004 --> 00:36:00.848
The Top Man himself, Mrs. Biggs.

649
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.904
-Julia.
-Julia.


650
00:36:05.263 --> 00:36:08.388
And this is Julia's mother,
Mrs. Coleman.


651
00:36:09.107 --> 00:36:10.957
Of course it is.

652
00:36:11.588 --> 00:36:15.739
Well, it's obvious where
Julia's beauty comes from.


653
00:36:15.953 --> 00:36:16.710
Oh.

654
00:36:17.583 --> 00:36:19.715
And me with my hair lookin' like this.

655
00:36:19.825 --> 00:36:23.178
-Oh, no. It looks magnificent.
-Why, thank you.


656
00:36:23.239 --> 00:36:25.043
-Well, Mr, um...
-You can call me Dudley.


657
00:36:26.158 --> 00:36:27.712
-Dudley. You're very welcome here.
-Thank you.


658
00:36:29.441 --> 00:36:30.334
Excuse us.

659
00:36:33.592 --> 00:36:34.689
What are you doing?

660
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:36.877
Now, that's what I call good-lookin'!

661
00:36:37.941 --> 00:36:40.549
Your daddy used to look
like that back in 19...


662
00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:44.061
-Ma, ma, ma. I've heard it 100 times.
-Yeah, well...


663
00:36:44.467 --> 00:36:47.817
...maybe now, with him around, you'll have
time to deal with some of your own problems.


664
00:36:48.138 --> 00:36:50.072
The Good Lord's the only
one who can do that.


665
00:36:50.307 --> 00:36:52.564
-Honey, you don't mean that.
-Yeah, I do.


666
00:36:53.434 --> 00:36:54.520
Ma!

667
00:36:56.137 --> 00:36:58.288
I was gonna go over
by the window, Julia.


668
00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:59.829
There's too many rules in this house.

669
00:37:12.351 --> 00:37:13.899
You're the man in the street...

670
00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:15.713
and in the snow and...

671
00:37:17.219 --> 00:37:18.071
My name's Dudley.

672
00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:20.998
I'm here to help your father.

673
00:37:21.945 --> 00:37:23.328
I'm Jeremiah.

674
00:37:23.862 --> 00:37:25.382
It's nice to meet you, Jeremiah.

675
00:37:26.438 --> 00:37:27.690
You've got a real nice room here.

676
00:37:28.192 --> 00:37:29.538
Thank you.

677
00:37:29.845 --> 00:37:31.968
Wow, you've got a lot
of neat stuff in here.


678
00:37:33.871 --> 00:37:34.831
And what is this?

679
00:37:36.065 --> 00:37:38.522
My toy ambulance is broken.

680
00:37:38.623 --> 00:37:41.858
The battery got stole,
and the lights don't work anymore.


681
00:37:41.919 --> 00:37:42.949
Is that right?

682
00:37:44.753 --> 00:37:46.473
I'll see what I can do here.

683
00:37:48.733 --> 00:37:50.669
It never had a siren!

684
00:37:55.482 --> 00:37:56.375
Never had a siren?

685
00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.457
No.

686
00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:06.573
You look sad there, Jeremiah.

687
00:38:08.828 --> 00:38:09.848
Have you been crying?

688
00:38:10.022 --> 00:38:11.035
Yes.

689
00:38:13.029 --> 00:38:14.781
I'm sorry about your friend, Hakim.

690
00:38:18.694 --> 00:38:20.224
What if I told you...

691
00:38:20.811 --> 00:38:22.424
that he's not really gone?

692
00:38:23.165 --> 00:38:24.149
Hakim?

693
00:38:24.755 --> 00:38:27.008
Did he run away and come back?

694
00:38:27.281 --> 00:38:28.424
No, he never left.

695
00:38:28.813 --> 00:38:31.116
Yes, he did. I saw him go.

696
00:38:34.397 --> 00:38:35.336
Well, you know,

697
00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:37.953
my mother...

698
00:38:38.821 --> 00:38:41.312
once lost someone
who was very dear to her.


699
00:38:41.502 --> 00:38:43.726
He wasn't as young as Hakim,
but he was...


700
00:38:44.166 --> 00:38:45.472
too young, just the same.

701
00:38:46.362 --> 00:38:50.458
And she would always do something
that seemed to make her feel better.


702
00:38:51.169 --> 00:38:52.806
-You want to try it?
-Yeah.


703
00:38:52.867 --> 00:38:53.948
All right, close your eyes.

704
00:38:56.198 --> 00:38:57.301
Do you remember

705
00:38:58.036 --> 00:38:59.789
playing in the snow with Hakim?

706
00:39:02.211 --> 00:39:03.504
Do you remember

707
00:39:03.917 --> 00:39:05.190
what his laugh sounded like?

708
00:39:05.815 --> 00:39:06.893
Yes.

709
00:39:08.379 --> 00:39:10.069
Do you remember

710
00:39:10.422 --> 00:39:12.052
what he looked like catching a ball?

711
00:39:12.807 --> 00:39:15.325
He never caught the ball in his life.

712
00:39:16.133 --> 00:39:17.632
But I remember.

713
00:39:17.753 --> 00:39:21.389
That's because when God
takes someone away from us...


714
00:39:21.906 --> 00:39:25.556
He leaves what's most important
about that person with us.


715
00:39:27.018 --> 00:39:28.437
Right here in our hearts.

716
00:39:29.237 --> 00:39:31.986
Yeah, but I still miss him.

717
00:39:32.208 --> 00:39:34.220
Well, she still misses him too.

718
00:39:36.859 --> 00:39:38.395
Are you all right?

719
00:39:39.562 --> 00:39:41.763
Maybe you should close your eyes.

720
00:39:47.635 --> 00:39:50.121
Mommy says I can write to him.

721
00:39:50.797 --> 00:39:52.609
-Do you know how to spell his name?
-No.


722
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:54.074
-You want to learn?
-Yeah.


723
00:39:54.135 --> 00:39:55.589
-All right.
-Hakim.


724
00:39:55.931 --> 00:39:59.196
-Starts with an 'H.'
-And ends with 'akim.'


725
00:39:59.257 --> 00:40:01.500
There you go. Perfect.

726
00:40:04.677 --> 00:40:06.212
Wow!

727
00:40:10.351 --> 00:40:11.800
Fishies in a TV.

728
00:40:29.652 --> 00:40:30.407
Windows.

729
00:40:49.743 --> 00:40:50.404
Henry?

730
00:40:53.216 --> 00:40:55.652
I know I said make an appointment...

731
00:40:55.713 --> 00:40:58.191
but I didn't say anything
about filling out any form.


732
00:41:01.161 --> 00:41:02.281
Beverly!

733
00:41:03.701 --> 00:41:05.276
Beverly, I need you.

734
00:41:06.382 --> 00:41:08.813
I gave her the day off to do
some Christmas shopping, Henry.


735
00:41:11.982 --> 00:41:14.003
You gave my secretary the day...

736
00:41:14.074 --> 00:41:16.634
Yes, she needed some time off
to be with her children...


737
00:41:16.744 --> 00:41:19.087
and I needed time to
do my job with you.

738
00:41:20.346 --> 00:41:23.220
-What job? What are you doing here?
-Henry, Henry, Henry!


739
00:41:23.613 --> 00:41:24.859
How many times I got to tell you?

740
00:41:25.085 --> 00:41:27.739
I'm here in answer to your request
for help. And Julia's.


741
00:41:28.832 --> 00:41:32.007
You can forget about the boiler.
You got more important problem...


742
00:41:33.189 --> 00:41:34.359
Ah, here she is now.

743
00:41:34.734 --> 00:41:35.846
-Henry?
-Wha...


744
00:41:36.071 --> 00:41:36.722
Whoo!

745
00:41:37.652 --> 00:41:38.732
Lord have mercy!

746
00:41:39.365 --> 00:41:44.749
Honey, remind me the next time I pay
a visit, I wanna get paid! Okay?


747
00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:46.702
Hi, Dudley.

748
00:41:47.071 --> 00:41:48.310
-Julia.
-Dudley.


749
00:41:48.689 --> 00:41:51.082
D
-U
-D
-L
-E
-Y.

750
00:41:51.839 --> 00:41:53.670
-Perfect.
-Very good.


751
00:41:53.997 --> 00:41:55.179
Poi-fect. Poi-fect.

752
00:41:55.578 --> 00:41:57.014
What happened with Billy Eldridge?

753
00:41:57.130 --> 00:42:00.497
Uh, uh, the judge
set the bail at $25,000.


754
00:42:00.558 --> 00:42:03.624
-Henry, that child's still in jail?
-Julia, I did what I could!


755
00:42:07.351 --> 00:42:09.516
Come on, sweetie.
We have a nativity play to rehearse.


756
00:42:09.577 --> 00:42:11.155
You can't rehearse.
It's freezing in there.


757
00:42:11.297 --> 00:42:13.840
Henry, I'll be chasing 15 kids all day.
I don't think I'll get cold.


758
00:42:14.076 --> 00:42:16.562
And after we're through, you're
taking your son shopping, remember?


759
00:42:16.977 --> 00:42:17.930
-Henry.
-Huh?


760
00:42:18.262 --> 00:42:19.349
Your wife's talking to you.

761
00:42:20.606 --> 00:42:23.650
Oh, yes, uh, uh...
Hanley's, 1:00. 1:00?


762
00:42:25.689 --> 00:42:26.749
Spell Hakim for me, baby.

763
00:42:27.541 --> 00:42:32.174
M -I -K -A -H.
Dudley's teaching me to spell backwards.


764
00:42:32.728 --> 00:42:35.384
Maybe he can teach Daddy
how to be on time.


765
00:42:35.828 --> 00:42:36.923
These are perfect.

766
00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:40.297
Beverly never typed a
perfect letter in her life.


767
00:42:40.358 --> 00:42:43.435
Yes, I did those myself,
once I figured out that fish typewriter.


768
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:45.004
Let's get this straight, Dud.

769
00:42:45.298 --> 00:42:48.899
I do not appreciate some stranger
coming into my office...


770
00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:52.148
Angels are hardly strangers, Henry.
And don't call me 'Dud.'


771
00:42:52.982 --> 00:42:54.881
Julia, hold on! Wait for me!

772
00:42:54.942 --> 00:42:58.869
Excuse me, Mother, not now. I'm having
a little meeting. You understand.


773
00:42:59.278 --> 00:43:01.143
-Bye, Marguerite!
-Bye, Dudley!


774
00:43:01.213 --> 00:43:03.569
-Mama, come on!
-Start that rehearsal!


775
00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:07.105
You are not going around telling
my family this ridiculous story...


776
00:43:07.446 --> 00:43:10.415
No, of course not.
They think the church council sent me.


777
00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:11.640
The church council!

778
00:43:11.701 --> 00:43:16.100
Why don't we continue this on our way
to the meeting with Joe Hamilton?


779
00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:17.987
The meeting.

780
00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:21.488
-So, which floor is he on?
-I'm not telling.


781
00:43:21.549 --> 00:43:23.202
-Henry, what's the floor?
-Go away.


782
00:43:23.372 --> 00:43:24.911
-You asked for help.
-Not from you.


783
00:43:24.972 --> 00:43:27.527
I don't need you in here, out there
or anywhere. Do you understand?


784
00:43:29.766 --> 00:43:32.860
You didn't have to let the doors close
on me downstairs, Henry. That was cold.


785
00:43:32.921 --> 00:43:34.801
Well, I figured you'd just fly up.

786
00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:38.946
You know, if you're really
a you-know-what, where are your wings?


787
00:43:39.806 --> 00:43:42.131
You're caught up in stereotypes, Henry.
That's your problem.


788
00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:43.312
Hello, Reverend.

789
00:43:44.159 --> 00:43:46.482
That's a beautiful dress you have on.
Just magnificent.


790
00:43:47.006 --> 00:43:48.383
Why, thank you.

791
00:43:48.647 --> 00:43:49.471
You're very welcome.

792
00:43:51.822 --> 00:43:53.444
Is Mr. Hamilton inside?

793
00:43:54.221 --> 00:43:57.428
Oh, he's taping another TV commercial,
but you can wait in his office.


794
00:43:58.123 --> 00:43:59.884
-Thank you.
-You're very welcome.


795
00:44:03.019 --> 00:44:05.406
Hamilton Realty. Hi, Amy.

796
00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:07.794
You know that old dress
from Mom's closet?


797
00:44:08.591 --> 00:44:09.893
It's back in style.

798
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:13.447
'That's a lovely dress!'

799
00:44:13.508 --> 00:44:16.224
It was a lovely dress. I mean,
you gotta admit, it was a lovely dress.


800
00:44:16.285 --> 00:44:17.633
What kind of angel talks like that?

801
00:44:17.694 --> 00:44:19.424
The kind of angel that has good taste.

802
00:44:20.925 --> 00:44:22.355
Well, you're still not going in here.

803
00:44:23.316 --> 00:44:26.368
Henry, I'm like this with the creator
of the entire universe.


804
00:44:26.429 --> 00:44:28.257
Now, you don't think a little
door's gonna stop me, do you?


805
00:44:28.359 --> 00:44:28.926
-Yes.

806
00:44:29.253 --> 00:44:29.814
How?

807
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:31.740
How?

808
00:44:33.113 --> 00:44:34.059
Rule Number Two.

809
00:44:38.583 --> 00:44:41.302
All right, fine, Henry. Can't make you
do anything you don't wanna do.


810
00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:45.037
That's right! That's right!
I always liked that rule!


811
00:44:46.609 --> 00:44:47.812
Did you like that smile?

812
00:44:48.275 --> 00:44:49.601
I tilted my head to the side.

813
00:44:49.663 --> 00:44:50.565
I loved it.

814
00:44:51.975 --> 00:44:52.805
Henry Biggs.

815
00:44:53.427 --> 00:44:55.409
-How are you doing?
-Julia's good?


816
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:56.343
She's very good.

817
00:44:56.686 --> 00:44:58.334
Uh, Henry, this is Debbie Page.

818
00:44:58.629 --> 00:45:01.033
-Hi.
-She's the station manager over at WRKO.


819
00:45:01.232 --> 00:45:03.474
They're televising your Christmas
sermon this year.


820
00:45:03.535 --> 00:45:05.955
We need to get your text
for the TelePrompTer, Reverend.


821
00:45:06.016 --> 00:45:09.417
-I'm working on it.
-Later, Debbie. Come on. Let's see the guys.


822
00:45:09.513 --> 00:45:10.862
Wait 'til you see where
you're gonna move to, Henry.


823
00:45:10.994 --> 00:45:11.382
-What?

824
00:45:11.443 --> 00:45:13.953
A planned community.
Your son could ride his bike to school.


825
00:45:19.582 --> 00:45:21.383
-Mary?
-Henry!


826
00:45:21.451 --> 00:45:23.354
Osbert? What are you doing here?

827
00:45:23.747 --> 00:45:27.867
Well, I, we, um... We came to check out,
the same as you, Henry!


828
00:45:28.301 --> 00:45:28.905
Saul.

829
00:45:29.153 --> 00:45:32.808
Uh, listen to the man, Henry.
We think it makes sense.


830
00:45:33.209 --> 00:45:34.721
Well, of course it makes sense.

831
00:45:35.665 --> 00:45:37.826
That's what it's gonna look like
when it's finished.


832
00:45:37.887 --> 00:45:40.172
-What do you think, Henry?
-Isn't that nice?


833
00:45:40.233 --> 00:45:41.357
It's a new city landmark.

834
00:45:41.957 --> 00:45:43.057
It's a whole new neighbourhood.

835
00:45:43.239 --> 00:45:44.840
A different clientele, so to speak.

836
00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:47.933
I'm hoping, with everyone here,
we can once and for all...


837
00:45:47.994 --> 00:45:50.453
persuade you to move
into the new world, Henry.


838
00:45:51.089 --> 00:45:54.376
Well, all we need is
a boiler that works...


839
00:45:54.502 --> 00:45:56.830
and we'll be fine in the
world that we're in.


840
00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:01.197
New boiler. Henry, look at this.

841
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:03.356
Day care facilities.

842
00:46:03.463 --> 00:46:04.547
We need that.

843
00:46:04.608 --> 00:46:05.402
We could sure use that.

844
00:46:07.823 --> 00:46:09.288
Senior citizens' club.

845
00:46:09.778 --> 00:46:11.700
-That's much better than ours.
-Mm-hmm.


846
00:46:12.142 --> 00:46:14.307
-What I'm offering you here, Henry...
-Well, it is.


847
00:46:15.178 --> 00:46:17.810
TV cameras and lighting built right in.

848
00:46:18.374 --> 00:46:20.775
-Look at that!
-It's a pulpit to preach to the world!


849
00:46:21.444 --> 00:46:22.307
It's beautiful!

850
00:46:22.799 --> 00:46:25.406
All you have to
say is, 'I'll do it.'

851
00:46:30.587 --> 00:46:32.445
Say yeah. Say yeah.

852
00:46:32.727 --> 00:46:33.738
All right.

853
00:46:35.991 --> 00:46:36.896
Look, say yes,

854
00:46:37.271 --> 00:46:38.925
and I'll throw in that new boiler.

855
00:46:39.294 --> 00:46:41.570
I'll stop St. Matt's
from freezing over Christmas...


856
00:46:41.631 --> 00:46:43.978
if that's the price
I have to pay to get you.


857
00:46:45.482 --> 00:46:46.373
And if I accept,

858
00:46:47.569 --> 00:46:48.687
what price am I paying?

859
00:46:50.237 --> 00:46:53.640
Henry, what you see there is
the answer to all your problems.


860
00:46:54.375 --> 00:46:55.109
Amen.

861
00:46:55.838 --> 00:46:56.600
Isn't it?

862
00:46:58.592 --> 00:47:01.834
I need my Magi. 
The Magi's entrance.

863
00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:04.728
What does the sheep say in this play?

864
00:47:05.405 --> 00:47:06.212
Baaaa!

865
00:47:06.454 --> 00:47:07.410
Ah. Mmm.

866
00:47:07.471 --> 00:47:09.976
Does everybody know their parts?
You know your parts?


867
00:47:10.052 --> 00:47:13.683
-What's my part?
-What's your part? You're a camel.


868
00:47:14.096 --> 00:47:15.862
-I need my shepherds.
-I'm a shepherd.


869
00:47:16.271 --> 00:47:19.035
-Come here. You two, over here.
-I'm the angel.


870
00:47:19.096 --> 00:47:20.275
In there. Come on.

871
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.013
Kick it, Mrs. Havergal. 
Let's do this.

872
00:47:25.667 --> 00:47:27.560

Yeah.

-Again.
-All right.


903
00:49:24.435 --> 00:49:25.923
You take this one solo, okay?

904
00:49:26.426 --> 00:49:27.790
-Okay?
-Comet's swingin'!


905
00:49:28.235 --> 00:49:30.394
-Ooh, look at that.
-Beautiful, isn't it?


906
00:49:30.937 --> 00:49:32.870
Uh-huh. Sure is.

907
00:49:36.142 --> 00:49:37.439
Go in and try it on.

908
00:49:39.495 --> 00:49:41.658
We're supposed to be shopping
for Henry, remember?


909
00:49:42.409 --> 00:49:46.402
You with that nightgown on is
all the gift Henry would want.


910
00:49:47.314 --> 00:49:49.404
-Trust me.
-A gift from Jeremiah.


911
00:49:49.635 --> 00:49:52.457
-Oh. Ho, ho.
-Mmm.


912
00:49:54.731 --> 00:49:56.661
So how long do you think
he's gonna be with that snake?


913
00:49:56.722 --> 00:49:57.798
He'll be along soon.

914
00:49:59.529 --> 00:50:00.659
How'd you two meet, anyway?

915
00:50:01.887 --> 00:50:02.502
Hmm.

916
00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:05.938
We were in adjoining
strollers, and, uh...


917
00:50:06.466 --> 00:50:07.936
and one day I took his pacifier,

918
00:50:08.414 --> 00:50:10.097
and he made a really
big noise about it.


919
00:50:10.471 --> 00:50:11.341
Who wouldn't?

920
00:50:12.104 --> 00:50:14.713
You know, when he was about ten,
he started wearing suits to school.


921
00:50:14.773 --> 00:50:15.339
What?

922
00:50:15.587 --> 00:50:16.863
Trying to impress me.

923
00:50:17.474 --> 00:50:18.758
Obviously, it worked.

924
00:50:19.684 --> 00:50:21.109
He'd walk me home...

925
00:50:22.448 --> 00:50:24.827
and I always thought he was cuter
without his glasses, so...


926
00:50:25.284 --> 00:50:26.702
one day he took them off for me.

927
00:50:27.841 --> 00:50:30.541
And he slipped on the ice,
and fell right on his fanny.


928
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:32.779
Sounds like love to me.

929
00:50:34.437 --> 00:50:36.076
Daddy said we were born friends.

930
00:50:39.876 --> 00:50:41.505
He did a lot for Henry, your father.

931
00:50:42.415 --> 00:50:43.419
He was the best.

932
00:50:44.483 --> 00:50:47.245
Mommy. Enough!

933
00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:52.772
-Is it good, Dudley?
-Mm-hmm. Great.


934
00:50:52.845 --> 00:50:55.548
How is your food, Jeremiah? Mmmmm.

935
00:50:55.609 --> 00:50:56.304
Julia.

936
00:50:57.343 --> 00:50:57.884
Henry.

937
00:50:57.945 --> 00:50:59.353
Ah, Jeremiah.

938
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:01.553
Dudley!

939
00:51:01.614 --> 00:51:02.359
Henry.

940
00:51:03.899 --> 00:51:05.317
Okay, Jer. Let's go shopping.

941
00:51:05.591 --> 00:51:07.607
-Wait, honey. What happened?
-I'll tell you later.


942
00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:09.993
-Come on. Come on.
-Henry, it is later.


943
00:51:10.237 --> 00:51:12.540
It's about an hour later
than when you were supposed to be here.


944
00:51:12.731 --> 00:51:13.537
Now, what happened?

945
00:51:14.364 --> 00:51:14.917
It's a long story.

946
00:51:14.986 --> 00:51:17.175
You know, you and Julia need to talk.

947
00:51:17.236 --> 00:51:20.647
I can take Jeremiah shopping.
I'm an excellent gift consultant.


948
00:51:20.852 --> 00:51:23.380
Yes, Dudley. I want Dudley.

949
00:51:23.441 --> 00:51:25.147
Wait a minute.
I wanted to take him shopping.


950
00:51:25.776 --> 00:51:27.646
You two have more important
things to talk about.


951
00:51:27.707 --> 00:51:30.454
-Dud-ley! Dud-ley! Dud-ley!
-Jeremiah.


952
00:51:30.515 --> 00:51:33.780
We'll be right across the street
at the toy store. Okay?


953
00:51:33.841 --> 00:51:35.328
-Julia! Julia!
-Dud-ley!


954
00:51:35.389 --> 00:51:38.391
-Jere-miah! Put your hat on.
-Dud-ley! Dud-ley!


955
00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.967
-So, who are we shopping for?
-Grandma.


956
00:51:42.046 --> 00:51:44.205
-Any idea what she wants?
-A new ashtray.


957
00:51:44.266 --> 00:51:47.633
-Mom took all her old ones.
-Let's get something for Hakim.


958
00:51:48.198 --> 00:51:49.102
So, what happened?

959
00:51:54.205 --> 00:51:54.906
Julia.

960
00:52:00.211 --> 00:52:00.816
I...

961
00:52:03.199 --> 00:52:05.241
I've decided to accept
Joe Hamilton's offer.


962
00:52:08.572 --> 00:52:10.345
Julia, did you hear me?

963
00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:14.783
I heard you. I just can't
believe what I've heard.


964
00:52:14.844 --> 00:52:15.810
-Then let me explain.

965
00:52:16.097 --> 00:52:17.751
Excuse me. Can I get you anything?

966
00:52:17.851 --> 00:52:20.049
Oh, no, no, no. 
No, thank you.

967
00:52:20.133 --> 00:52:20.998
Okay.

968
00:52:23.007 --> 00:52:27.393
Listen, Saul was there,
Mary Halford, Andy and Osbert.


969
00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:28.930
But what were they doing there?

970
00:52:28.991 --> 00:52:32.932
Every one of them was begging me,
arguing with me, blackmailing me.


971
00:52:32.993 --> 00:52:35.712
Blackmail!
They're gonna put in a new boiler tomorrow.


972
00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.150
-Henry, he bought you for a boiler?
-Shh. Julia.


973
00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:43.874
Sorry. Sorry. Excuse us. 
Of course not!

974
00:52:44.254 --> 00:52:46.405
-Oooooh...
-Julia, let me show you something.


975
00:52:46.957 --> 00:52:48.336
Julia, Julia...

976
00:52:49.821 --> 00:52:52.536
he is building the most beautiful church
you've ever seen.


977
00:52:52.597 --> 00:52:54.892
Look at that.
Day care centre, youth centre.


978
00:52:54.953 --> 00:52:56.852
Henry, he is building
a shrine to himself!


979
00:52:57.114 --> 00:52:58.303
Eight years, Julia.

980
00:53:00.183 --> 00:53:01.316
And what do I
have to show for it?

981
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:05.609
So you give up our lives
without even talking to me, Henry?


982
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:09.499
This solves all of our problems, Julia.
Why can't you see that?


983
00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:12.713
My father trusted you with St. Matt's.
How dare you walk out on it like this!


984
00:53:12.782 --> 00:53:15.307
All right, all right.
Your father was a saint, and I'm not!


985
00:53:15.385 --> 00:53:16.937
But I'm here, Julia, and he isn't.

986
00:53:21.605 --> 00:53:22.975
I'm sorry, Julia.

987
00:53:24.327 --> 00:53:25.728
Give me the car keys, Henry!

988
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:27.721
Julia!

989
00:53:29.598 --> 00:53:31.990
-Julia, please sit down.
-Give me the keys, Henry.


990
00:53:32.114 --> 00:53:35.320
Excuse me. Would you kindly give her the
keys? I have customers sitting here.


991
00:53:36.399 --> 00:53:37.499
Sorry. Sorry.

992
00:53:38.158 --> 00:53:40.098
Julia, please listen to me.

993
00:53:40.343 --> 00:53:42.974
Henry, I can't.
I don't even know who you are anymore.


994
00:53:43.873 --> 00:53:44.552
Julia.

995
00:53:48.684 --> 00:53:50.286
Come on, Jeremiah. 
We're leaving.

996
00:53:51.187 --> 00:53:53.178
I got Daddy's present.

997
00:53:53.255 --> 00:53:56.418
And I bought a fire engine for Hakim.

998
00:53:56.759 --> 00:53:58.426
It was on sale.

999
00:53:58.494 --> 00:54:00.606
Yes, that's wonderful, honey.
That's wonderful.


1000
00:54:06.402 --> 00:54:07.187
All right.

1001
00:54:08.367 --> 00:54:10.255
You're going to have to
support him now, Julia.


1002
00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:11.280
You hear me?

1003
00:54:11.582 --> 00:54:13.475
Now is when he needs you most.

1004
00:54:13.888 --> 00:54:15.595
Mama, I can't support what's wrong.

1005
00:54:15.938 --> 00:54:19.169
Preachin' God's word is never wrong,
no matter where you do it from.


1006
00:54:22.032 --> 00:54:23.888
He didn't even discuss it with me.

1007
00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.667
Daddy would have never made a decision
like that without discussing it with you.


1008
00:54:27.728 --> 00:54:28.760
Sure he would.

1009
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:32.384
Your Daddy kept things from me all the time.
Especially church business.


1010
00:54:32.676 --> 00:54:34.674
Well, it was different in those days.

1011
00:54:35.044 --> 00:54:36.002
Those days!

1012
00:54:36.575 --> 00:54:38.557
Child, men ain't changed since Adam!

1013
00:54:39.428 --> 00:54:41.192
And he gave up
one of his own ribs,

1014
00:54:41.451 --> 00:54:43.571
just so he could have
somebody to keep things from!


1015
00:54:49.224 --> 00:54:52.209
You know, gettin' angry
at a dead tree is not gonna help.


1016
00:54:52.598 --> 00:54:55.359
Yeah, but it wouldn't look good
to punch out a pastor, either.


1017
00:54:57.428 --> 00:55:00.424
No, you don't... you don't...
you don't mean that...


1018
00:55:00.485 --> 00:55:01.979
'Cause you know you love him.

1019
00:55:02.259 --> 00:55:04.151
Yeah, he knows it, too.
That's the problem.


1020
00:55:04.659 --> 00:55:06.313
He knows I'll always be there,

1021
00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:07.759
just like a pet.

1022
00:55:08.095 --> 00:55:10.777
-Ouch!
-See? God doesn't like ugly.


1023
00:55:10.931 --> 00:55:11.893
Let me see.

1024
00:55:15.889 --> 00:55:16.982
You ever had your palm read?

1025
00:55:21.327 --> 00:55:22.113
Okay.

1026
00:55:28.896 --> 00:55:31.883
I see a beautiful woman
with a good heart.


1027
00:55:33.421 --> 00:55:37.252
Only has to open her eyes to realize
that everything she ever wanted...


1028
00:55:38.206 --> 00:55:39.311
she already has.

1029
00:55:41.465 --> 00:55:42.829
You didn't even look at my hand.

1030
00:55:44.136 --> 00:55:44.930
But I held it.

1031
00:55:47.765 --> 00:55:49.156
Do you see Henry and me?

1032
00:55:50.597 --> 00:55:51.444
Hmmm...

1033
00:55:52.558 --> 00:55:53.705
let's see.

1034
00:55:54.955 --> 00:55:56.932
-Ow! Ow! Ow!
-Ohhh.


1035
00:55:57.116 --> 00:55:59.394
Oh, it's so hot, 
I had to let it go.

1036
00:55:59.455 --> 00:56:01.889
You must be talking about my past.

1037
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:03.982
-Mrs. Biggs, you forgot this.
-Thanks.


1038
00:56:04.399 --> 00:56:06.348
Every fire dies sometime, Dudley.

1039
00:56:07.621 --> 00:56:10.646
What do you do when you have to decide
if the memory of it is enough?


1040
00:56:11.024 --> 00:56:12.554
-What do you do?
-Yeah.


1041
00:56:13.311 --> 00:56:14.658
What you do is you...

1042
00:56:16.277 --> 00:56:17.723
you go dancing... ...that's what you do.
You go out.


1043
00:56:17.784 --> 00:56:20.314
Dancing? -Yes.
You go out. You're gonna go dancing,


1044
00:56:20.388 --> 00:56:22.861
and put on a beautiful dress, make your
husband break out the cologne.


1045
00:56:22.922 --> 00:56:23.772
Have you met my husband?

1046
00:56:23.833 --> 00:56:25.187
-That's right, I met him.
-He hasn't taken me out in...


1047
00:56:25.248 --> 00:56:27.341
Far too long. That's my point.

1048
00:56:28.665 --> 00:56:29.632
But tonight's gonna be different.

1049
00:56:30.483 --> 00:56:31.877
Tonight you're gonna strike a match.

1050
00:56:32.678 --> 00:56:35.772
No, not a match, a, a firecracker!
You'll see.


1051
00:56:38.712 --> 00:56:43.098
You take your coat off, you go upstairs
and you take your wife out dancing.


1052
00:56:43.159 --> 00:56:44.691
Can't do it. Not tonight.

1053
00:56:45.045 --> 00:56:47.317
Henry, you and Julia need this.

1054
00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:51.601
Mr. Kingman needs his minister
with him at the hospital,


1055
00:56:51.662 --> 00:56:53.382
and the seniors need blankets.

1056
00:56:53.443 --> 00:56:54.654
You're only one man, Henry.

1057
00:56:54.834 --> 00:56:57.701
Things don't get fixed
waiting for the next guy to do it.


1058
00:56:57.762 --> 00:56:59.923
-Including marriages.
-Dudley!


1059
00:56:59.984 --> 00:57:00.638
Henry!

1060
00:57:03.068 --> 00:57:04.246
You already told her, didn't you?

1061
00:57:05.678 --> 00:57:07.926
She's upstairs dressing right now...

1062
00:57:08.007 --> 00:57:10.129
and once again I'm gonna
look like the bad guy.


1063
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:11.022
-Not if you go.

1064
00:57:11.083 --> 00:57:13.467
-Dudley!
-What? I'm just trying to help you.


1065
00:57:13.856 --> 00:57:14.975
You're just trying to help.

1066
00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:18.281
All right, you can help...
by taking her.


1067
00:57:18.757 --> 00:57:20.280
-Me?
-Yes, you.


1068
00:57:20.341 --> 00:57:22.673
-You're missing the point, Henry.
-No, no.


1069
00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:24.144
The point is...

1070
00:57:25.115 --> 00:57:27.042
Mr. Kingman won't wait.

1071
00:57:27.853 --> 00:57:29.632
Now, you go, tell
me all about it later.

1072
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:33.610
And you make sure
you tell her I'm sorry.


1073
00:57:34.667 --> 00:57:36.450
-Ohh, Henry.
-Good night.


1074
00:57:37.406 --> 00:57:38.581
-Henry.
-Not too late.


1075
00:57:38.642 --> 00:57:40.102
-Henry.
-And no drinking.


1076
00:57:42.381 --> 00:57:44.174
It was not supposed to go like this.

1077
00:57:46.026 --> 00:57:47.378
Good night, Mommy.

1078
00:57:47.655 --> 00:57:48.726
Okay, good night.

1079
00:57:48.787 --> 00:57:51.366
Don't worry about us.
I'm gonna give 'em a hot bath...


1080
00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:54.307
and then we're gonna play Monopoly...
for real money!


1081
00:57:54.552 --> 00:57:55.859
Yea!

1082
00:57:58.888 --> 00:57:59.888
How do I look?

1083
00:58:01.368 --> 00:58:02.707
Oh! Oh, my!

1084
00:58:04.836 --> 00:58:05.570
Henry?

1085
00:58:07.316 --> 00:58:08.002
Henry?

1086
00:58:09.316 --> 00:58:10.277
Henry?

1087
00:58:13.878 --> 00:58:14.636
Where's Henry?

1088
00:58:15.116 --> 00:58:16.387
He said... He said he's sorry.

1089
00:58:17.752 --> 00:58:18.898
He's sorry?

1090
00:58:19.498 --> 00:58:21.183
Yeah, he had to go.

1091
00:58:21.244 --> 00:58:24.042
One of the congregation
is in the hospital. Mr. Kingman.


1092
00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:27.441
Oh, yeah. He's been sick a long time.

1093
00:58:29.226 --> 00:58:30.445
I'll call his wife tomorrow.

1094
00:58:33.885 --> 00:58:34.970
Look, Julia,

1095
00:58:36.003 --> 00:58:37.529
he suggested that I, uh...

1096
00:58:37.905 --> 00:58:40.045
pinch-hit for him, if that's...

1097
00:58:40.699 --> 00:58:41.601
okay with you.

1098
00:58:44.715 --> 00:58:45.401
Hmm?

1099
00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.957
Welcome to Jazzie's, folks. Come on in.

1100
00:58:50.068 --> 00:58:51.654
-Thanks.
-Thank you.


1101
00:58:52.989 --> 00:58:53.724
My brother.

1102
00:59:10.794 --> 00:59:11.648
Ahhh!

1103
00:59:14.255 --> 00:59:15.998
Nice, huh? Dancing.

1104
00:59:16.483 --> 00:59:18.550
Do you dance? I bet
you're a good dancer.


1105
00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:20.427
It's been a long time.

1106
00:59:22.851 --> 00:59:23.751
You want to dance?

1107
00:59:24.548 --> 00:59:25.802
Why not?

1108
00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:28.273
-All right.
-Give it a shot.


1109
00:59:29.419 --> 00:59:31.381
-Bust a move. Right.
-Bust a move.


1110
00:59:40.898 --> 00:59:42.993
It doesn't seem like we're dancing
right for this music, huh?


1111
00:59:47.928 --> 00:59:48.921
Get down.

1112
00:59:49.926 --> 00:59:50.904
Oh, yeah.

1113
00:59:52.371 --> 00:59:53.440
Yeah, I see what you mean.

1114
00:59:53.501 --> 00:59:54.249
Yeah.

1115
01:00:03.452 --> 01:00:04.551
Oh, my.

1116
01:00:05.454 --> 01:00:07.969
-Go, brother!
-Ooh, hit it!


1117
01:00:10.362 --> 01:00:11.422
What's he doing?

1118
01:00:15.131 --> 01:00:15.874
Mmm!

1119
01:00:22.157 --> 01:00:23.051
Ooh.

1120
01:00:25.134 --> 01:00:27.048
-What's that one?
-The Popeye.


1121
01:00:27.536 --> 01:00:29.100
-The Popeye.
-Okay.


1122
01:00:30.253 --> 01:00:31.893
It's comin' back now.

1123
01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:33.252
I guess.

1124
01:00:35.005 --> 01:00:35.953
Whoo!

1125
01:00:37.389 --> 01:00:38.541
You get out about
as much as I do.

1126
01:00:38.698 --> 01:00:39.729
Less! Even less!

1127
01:00:43.239 --> 01:00:44.623
Oh, there we go!

1128
01:00:45.388 --> 01:00:47.490
-Oh, you're swimming.
-Yeah, backstroking.


1129
01:00:52.488 --> 01:00:53.286
Jules!

1130
01:00:54.465 --> 01:00:55.291
Bristloe!

1131
01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:57.605
-How you doin', sweet thing?
-Oh, my Lord!


1132
01:00:58.913 --> 01:01:01.845
-I thought you were in Paris.
-I was, but I've been back a while.


1133
01:01:01.918 --> 01:01:04.352
You and Henry don't
come by here much anymore.


1134
01:01:04.686 --> 01:01:06.853
Henry's been real busy.
But it's great to see you!


1135
01:01:06.914 --> 01:01:09.890
-You too! How you doin', sweet thing?
-Oh, I'm okay.


1136
01:01:11.988 --> 01:01:13.731
Dudley, Bristloe. Bristloe, Dudley.

1137
01:01:13.792 --> 01:01:16.825
-Oh, hey. How ya doin'?
-A pleasure, a pleasure.


1138
01:01:17.322 --> 01:01:21.019
If Henry hadn't helped me with that plane
ticket, I never would've gotten to Paris.


1139
01:01:22.086 --> 01:01:23.397
I tell you, I owe that man everything.

1140
01:01:23.458 --> 01:01:25.812
-You should call him and tell him.
-I will.


1141
01:01:25.873 --> 01:01:27.594
Do that. He'd love to hear from you.

1142
01:01:27.655 --> 01:01:31.397
Why don't we all just
sit down and visit?


1143
01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:33.177
Yeah.

1144
01:01:38.806 --> 01:01:40.644
-Okay.
-Thank you. Thank you.


1145
01:01:43.029 --> 01:01:44.910
So, Bristloe, are you and
Maxine still together?


1146
01:01:45.106 --> 01:01:46.626
-Oh, you better believe it.
-Oh, good.


1147
01:01:46.716 --> 01:01:49.526
She still calls six times a day
to make sure I'm being a good boy.


1148
01:01:50.879 --> 01:01:53.631
Fine woman, that Maxine.
You married, Dudley?


1149
01:01:54.136 --> 01:01:55.525
No, no.

1150
01:01:56.529 --> 01:02:00.332
No, I've never been lucky enough
to meet someone like Maxine... or Julia.


1151
01:02:00.613 --> 01:02:02.164
Ain't that the truth?

1152
01:02:03.004 --> 01:02:05.281
Used to be a time this little girl
could come by here every night.


1153
01:02:05.342 --> 01:02:07.524
-Yeah? You used to come in here?
-Sure.


1154
01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:11.267
Henry proposed to me
right over there, in that booth.


1155
01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:13.752
-Get outta here! Right over there?
-That's right.


1156
01:02:14.401 --> 01:02:16.715
-Those were the good old days, huh?
-Sure were.


1157
01:02:16.958 --> 01:02:19.033
-Couldn't squeeze a dime between 'em.
-Whew.


1158
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:21.506
She used to go on stage
and torch the place down.


1159
01:02:21.877 --> 01:02:22.903
Get outta here.

1160
01:02:24.792 --> 01:02:26.031
Now she just sings for the Lord.

1161
01:02:26.453 --> 01:02:27.425
Not that that's bad.

1162
01:02:28.809 --> 01:02:30.381
No, no, no. That's good.

1163
01:02:30.864 --> 01:02:32.047
Let me tell you somethin'.

1164
01:02:32.199 --> 01:02:34.331
Ever want to know what
lovin' really sounds like...


1165
01:02:34.929 --> 01:02:37.796
-she's got that secret in her voice.
-Oh, Bristloe, please.


1166
01:02:37.939 --> 01:02:39.846
Why don't you share
that secret with us, Julia?


1167
01:02:40.034 --> 01:02:44.835
-Come on, remind us.
-No. It's been years, a long time.


1168
01:02:44.896 --> 01:02:47.318
-You still do it in B?
-No, no, Bristloe. I don't do it at all.


1169
01:02:47.379 --> 01:02:49.601
Well, I'd like to know
what love really sounds like.


1170
01:02:50.745 --> 01:02:53.264
-Well, that solves that problem.
-Bristloe.


1171
01:02:53.594 --> 01:02:56.074
-I don't know the song.
-Don't want to hear another word.


1172
01:02:56.766 --> 01:02:57.789
I don't...

1173
01:02:57.850 --> 01:03:00.300
-We want to hear you sing.
You sang it for Henry.


1174
01:03:02.271 --> 01:03:03.604
I should be going home.

1175
01:03:04.051 --> 01:03:06.292
We're going to play this in B.
Just follow me, okay?


1176
01:03:06.353 --> 01:03:06.999
-Okay.

1177
01:03:07.848 --> 01:03:10.628
-Follow him, guys.
-You go out there. Go on. Yeah.


1178
01:03:12.788 --> 01:03:14.510
Go on, sing it for Henry.

1179
01:03:21.187 --> 01:03:21.874
No.

1180
01:03:22.778 --> 01:03:23.388
No.

1181
01:03:28.456 --> 01:03:29.319

Thank you.

1224
01:06:32.468 --> 01:06:34.949
I got your Christmas present yesterday.

1225
01:06:35.052 --> 01:06:36.801
You did? What'd you get?

1226
01:06:37.215 --> 01:06:39.397
I can't tell you. 
It's a secret.

1227
01:06:40.316 --> 01:06:42.507
What are you getting Mom for Christmas?

1228
01:06:42.593 --> 01:06:44.935
I don't know.
What do you think I should get her?


1229
01:06:45.509 --> 01:06:48.100
I think she'd like to go to bed.

1230
01:06:49.707 --> 01:06:51.512
Excuse me, young man?

1231
01:06:52.249 --> 01:06:56.015
She was looking at a nightie
in the store window with Dudley.


1232
01:06:56.076 --> 01:06:57.131
Was she now?

1233
01:06:57.523 --> 01:06:59.718
All right, come on, young man.
Sleep time.


1234
01:07:00.757 --> 01:07:03.388
Wait for your mama to get home,
you'll be too big for the bed.


1235
01:07:03.474 --> 01:07:07.329
Go get some more Vicks on your chest.
See if we can rid of that stuffy nose.


1236
01:07:07.731 --> 01:07:10.343
I think you were born
with a stuffy nose. Come on, here.


1237
01:07:10.404 --> 01:07:13.372
-Good night, Daddy.
-Good night, son.


1238
01:07:20.321 --> 01:07:21.651
Oh, thank you.

1239
01:07:21.712 --> 01:07:22.855
-Have a good evening.
-Thank you.


1240
01:07:25.352 --> 01:07:28.283
-Did you have a good time?
-Are you kidding? I had a great time. You?


1241
01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:31.032
I had a ball.
You're not such a bad dancer.


1242
01:07:31.093 --> 01:07:33.301
-I haven't had so much fun in a long time.
-I did too.


1243
01:07:33.669 --> 01:07:36.010
-I heard you singing.
-Yeah, I was about to get up there with you.


1244
01:07:36.071 --> 01:07:39.383
-I'm so glad you didn't.

-Dudley.


1247
01:07:46.102 --> 01:07:49.461
I guess I don't have to ask
if you had a... good time.


1248
01:07:49.925 --> 01:07:51.794
We did. We went to Jazzie's.

1249
01:07:53.066 --> 01:07:54.526
Some of the old band was there, and...

1250
01:07:56.488 --> 01:07:58.143
You've been at Jazzie's?

1251
01:07:59.372 --> 01:08:01.656
Yeah. Yeah. Bristloe was there too.

1252
01:08:01.798 --> 01:08:04.790
-Henry, your wife got on stage.
-Oh, wait, wait.


1253
01:08:04.851 --> 01:08:07.165
You went singing at Jazzie's all night?

1254
01:08:07.226 --> 01:08:10.426
-You told me to take her out.
-Not to the place where I proposed!


1255
01:08:11.507 --> 01:08:13.547
Henry, we had fun.

1256
01:08:14.154 --> 01:08:15.679
Remember what that used to be?

1257
01:08:16.059 --> 01:08:18.258
But honey. Jazzie's?

1258
01:08:20.243 --> 01:08:22.111
Well, maybe I sang at
Jazzie's because I won't


1259
01:08:22.172 --> 01:08:25.722
be singing in any Joe Hamilton church
Henry... wherever that may be.


1260
01:08:27.681 --> 01:08:29.676
-Thanks, Dudley.
-Good night, Julia.


1261
01:08:34.757 --> 01:08:36.824
-She had a good time, Henry.
-Oh, really?


1262
01:08:36.885 --> 01:08:40.998
Yeah. Yeah.
She told me about how you proposed.


1263
01:08:41.059 --> 01:08:43.130
-She showed me the booth.
-The booth?


1264
01:08:44.105 --> 01:08:46.135
I don't believe this entire situation!

1265
01:08:47.442 --> 01:08:48.265
No, you don't.

1266
01:08:48.651 --> 01:08:50.192
That's your trouble right there.

1267
01:08:51.466 --> 01:08:53.991
You don't believe in much of anything
anymore, do you, Henry?


1268
01:08:56.023 --> 01:08:58.069
You don't believe in me.
You don't believe in yourself.


1269
01:08:58.594 --> 01:09:00.357
You don't believe you can
make a difference anymore.


1270
01:09:00.842 --> 01:09:02.895
You don't even believe
that Billy Eldridge is innocent.


1271
01:09:03.879 --> 01:09:06.606
Billy... Of course I do.

1272
01:09:07.068 --> 01:09:08.776
You don't sound very convincing, Henry.

1273
01:09:09.391 --> 01:09:11.216
I tried to help him before.

1274
01:09:11.277 --> 01:09:12.231
-Did you?
-Yes.


1275
01:09:12.975 --> 01:09:15.117
And besides,
he doesn't even go to church.


1276
01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:17.164
Have you tried looking him in the eye

1277
01:09:17.225 --> 01:09:18.749
and asking him to tell the truth?

1278
01:09:20.243 --> 01:09:22.268
No. You know why?

1279
01:09:22.664 --> 01:09:25.510
I guess I was
just too busy having fun.

1280
01:09:26.481 --> 01:09:28.776
I guess that's your problem, Henry.
You're just too busy.


1281
01:09:30.144 --> 01:09:32.977
Your wife feels like
she's in a marriage by herself.


1282
01:09:33.962 --> 01:09:36.363
Your son lost his best friend.
What are you doing about that, Henry?


1283
01:09:36.645 --> 01:09:38.277
You don't have to listen to me.
You're right.


1284
01:09:40.763 --> 01:09:42.214
But you ought to listen to them.

1285
01:09:44.452 --> 01:09:47.523
Come on, everybody.
Time to make the Christmas baskets.


1286
01:09:52.819 --> 01:09:53.907
Aren't you gonna help?

1287
01:09:54.387 --> 01:09:56.240
I miss Hakim.

1288
01:09:59.707 --> 01:10:00.629
I know.

1289
01:10:02.710 --> 01:10:05.370
But a lot of people
are depending on us for those baskets.


1290
01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:08.268
-What do you think?
-Okay, then.


1291
01:10:08.329 --> 01:10:09.165
All right?

1292
01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:13.887
Gym socks.

1293
01:10:14.184 --> 01:10:17.873
Now, nothing says 'Merry
Christmas' like gym socks.


1294
01:10:24.077 --> 01:10:24.780
Ahh.

1295
01:10:28.296 --> 01:10:29.235
Uh, Billy.

1296
01:10:30.104 --> 01:10:31.701
Uh... here.

1297
01:10:32.874 --> 01:10:33.513
Thank you.

1298
01:10:35.876 --> 01:10:38.610
Billy, I need to talk to you.

1299
01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:40.972
You're wasting your time,
you know that?


1300
01:10:41.673 --> 01:10:43.720
The grand jury's
about to indict me in there.


1301
01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.259
You ever pray, son?

1302
01:10:49.603 --> 01:10:51.710
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah, right.


1303
01:10:51.771 --> 01:10:54.916
-You're too hip for that.
-All right. Okay.


1304
01:10:55.796 --> 01:10:57.896
-You play ball?
-Yeah.


1305
01:10:59.727 --> 01:11:03.008
When you play basketball, don't you
hope that when you shoot the ball...


1306
01:11:03.704 --> 01:11:05.222
that the ball goes into the net?

1307
01:11:05.299 --> 01:11:06.015
Yeah.

1308
01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:09.710
Well, that's all prayer is: Hope.

1309
01:11:10.897 --> 01:11:12.850
And helping to give people hope

1310
01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:14.796
is what I do.

1311
01:11:14.988 --> 01:11:15.843
What's the point?

1312
01:11:16.437 --> 01:11:18.069
No one believes me anyway.

1313
01:11:19.286 --> 01:11:19.873
Billy...

1314
01:11:25.631 --> 01:11:26.598
Look at me, son.

1315
01:11:28.948 --> 01:11:30.158
Were you a part of this or not?

1316
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:31.592
I swear, Rev,

1317
01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:34.137
it happened just like I said.

1318
01:11:34.988 --> 01:11:37.254
I've messed up before,
but I'm telling you the truth.


1319
01:11:57.618 --> 01:12:00.520
When was the last time
you said a prayer, Billy?


1320
01:12:01.962 --> 01:12:02.929
I don't know.

1321
01:12:03.242 --> 01:12:05.915
Well, I think it's about
time you gave it a try.


1322
01:12:08.575 --> 01:12:10.869
-What's the status of this case?
-Good morning, Judge!


1323
01:12:11.398 --> 01:12:12.342
Beautiful day, isn't it?

1324
01:12:12.403 --> 01:12:15.108
Reverend Biggs, this
is not a playground!


1325
01:12:15.306 --> 01:12:17.296
It's a court of law!
I don't have time...


1326
01:12:17.357 --> 01:12:21.350
I work for an even higher court,
Your Honour, and I'm finding the time.


1327
01:12:22.508 --> 01:12:24.382
I came to tell you Billy
Eldridge is innocent.


1328
01:12:24.443 --> 01:12:25.518
-I have your word on that?

1329
01:12:25.683 --> 01:12:27.993
-What does it take for me to show you?
-Let him in.


1330
01:12:28.181 --> 01:12:31.136
On his way to return a video,
he got $20 from an auto-teller.


1331
01:12:31.518 --> 01:12:33.363
There's a time on the receipt.

1332
01:12:33.531 --> 01:12:35.884
The victim identified him, Reverend.

1333
01:12:36.337 --> 01:12:36.877
The victim...

1334
01:12:36.938 --> 01:12:40.272
-Saw him standing there, Your Honour,
and that's all Billy was doing.


1335
01:12:41.487 --> 01:12:44.451
There's a grand jury hearing
going on right down the hall...


1336
01:12:44.519 --> 01:12:47.851
but the D.A. won't even present it
if you don't buy the evidence.


1337
01:12:47.912 --> 01:12:51.279
-And you know there isn't any.
-Reverend, come here. Come here.


1338
01:12:52.744 --> 01:12:54.949
I appreciate you
wanting to help the boy.


1339
01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:57.342
The young man, Your Honour,
helped himself.


1340
01:12:58.083 --> 01:13:02.183
He shows up every day to his $4.25
an hour job at Sampson's Stationery...


1341
01:13:02.347 --> 01:13:04.329
a job he's held steady for two years...

1342
01:13:04.445 --> 01:13:06.360
and he goes to school at night.

1343
01:13:07.158 --> 01:13:10.250
He came to a crossroads
a long time ago, Your Honour.


1344
01:13:10.448 --> 01:13:12.653
And he chose the right path.
Now it's up to you...


1345
01:13:13.345 --> 01:13:14.472
to judge not his past,

1346
01:13:15.307 --> 01:13:18.095
but his future; not his
failures, but his dreams;


1347
01:13:19.185 --> 01:13:20.498
not his imperfections,

1348
01:13:21.438 --> 01:13:23.069
but his possibilities.

01:13:23.555 --> 01:13:24.778

01:13:56.103 --> 01:13:57.422
Hey, bro, what's up?

1364
01:13:57.790 --> 01:13:58.914
God bless you, Pastor.

1365
01:13:58.975 --> 01:13:59.802
You guys get in the house.

1366
01:13:59.863 --> 01:14:02.202
-Billy's home! Billy's home!
-Come on, Mom.


1367
01:14:03.479 --> 01:14:06.170
It's so good to see you. Did they hurt you?
No, they didn't hurt me.


1368
01:14:06.395 --> 01:14:08.529
Are you all right? 
Are you hungry?

1369

You're hungry. You're hungry.
Kids, get the good dishes out.

01:21:33.502 --> 01:21:34.605
You take her to lunch.

1507
01:21:34.936 --> 01:21:36.159

1508

-You take her to Jazzie's.
-You asked me to.

01:21:58.562 --> 01:21:59.784
-Now?
-Yes, now.


1518
01:22:00.696 --> 01:22:03.601
I don't think I can do that.
Check the angel handbook.


1519
01:22:03.662 --> 01:22:04.548
It says I...

1520
01:22:05.262 --> 01:22:07.264
can't leave until I'm through, I think.

1521
01:22:07.325 --> 01:22:09.492
You see, it says right here...

1522
01:22:09.587 --> 01:22:11.202
Wait a minute. Hey! Henry!

1523
01:22:14.716 --> 01:22:15.448
What was that?

1524
01:22:17.158 --> 01:22:18.403
-Oooh!
-My goodness!


1525
01:22:21.611 --> 01:22:22.213

01:22:22.572 --> 01:22:24.468
-You're in trouble.
-What was that?


1527
01:22:26.054 --> 01:22:26.628
What is that?

1528
01:22:26.689 --> 01:22:28.818
It wasn't a sign that there's a new pope.
I'll tell you that.


1529
01:22:28.879 --> 01:22:30.012
What do you mean?

1530
01:22:30.073 --> 01:22:31.933
-You're in trouble. You
want me out of the house.


1531
01:22:31.994 --> 01:22:35.157
-Yes, I want you out.
-I'm not the problem. It wasn't me.


1532
01:22:35.319 --> 01:22:37.981
It wasn't me!
-Who are you talking to? Get out of my house!


1533
01:22:38.134 --> 01:22:39.631
What is going on in here?

1534
01:22:40.077 --> 01:22:42.382
I am terminating Dudley's services.
I want him out of here.


1535
01:22:42.443 --> 01:22:43.424
Is that what you want, Julia?

1536
01:22:43.485 --> 01:22:45.079
It isn't a question of what she wants.

1537
01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:50.349
All right, Julia, you're a part of this.
You say.

1541

You and Julia would have these problems
even if I never showed up.

01:23:07.809 --> 01:23:08.913
for you and for her.

1544
01:23:10.594 --> 01:23:12.453
And you're going to remind me, I'm sure.

1545
01:23:12.556 --> 01:23:14.659
St. Matt's is more
than just a church, Henry.


1546
01:23:15.125 --> 01:23:17.378
It's the glue that holds everything
together in this neighbourhood.

And you mark my word,

01:23:19.074 --> 01:23:22.566
without it, this neighbourhood
will fall, I guarantee it.


1549
01:23:23.078 --> 01:23:25.090
And Julia will never
look at you the same.


1550
01:23:36.685 --> 01:23:37.534
Hey, handsome.

1551
01:23:38.777 --> 01:23:40.149
Come and walk me across the street.

1552
01:23:40.210 --> 01:23:41.994
I gotta take this plate
over to Bessie Adams.


1553
01:23:42.685 --> 01:23:45.054
-Well, actually, I was...
-Walk me!


1554
01:23:46.502 --> 01:23:47.291
Delighted.

1555
01:23:53.142 --> 01:23:56.207
-I heard what you two were talking about.
-Really?


1556
01:23:56.966 --> 01:24:00.580
Now, you know I don't usually
pry into other folks' business.


1557
01:24:00.823 --> 01:24:01.339
Uh-huh.

1558
01:24:02.255 --> 01:24:03.088
Hold on a second.

1559
01:24:05.942 --> 01:24:07.369
Mmm-mm!

1560
01:24:09.813 --> 01:24:10.607
Now,

1561
01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:14.439
what are you doing to my daughter?

1562
01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:17.432
Mrs. Coleman, it's all right,
I promise you.


1563
01:24:17.846 --> 01:24:19.433
Nothin' is all right, Dudley,

1564
01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:23.280
when I see a married woman
look at a man that way.


1565
01:24:24.128 --> 01:24:26.436
I'm just tryin' to help them,
that's all.


1566
01:24:29.137 --> 01:24:32.072
You really shouldn't smoke.
Our time here on Earth is precious.


1567
01:24:32.527 --> 01:24:33.454
That's right.

1568
01:24:33.996 --> 01:24:37.821
And you know the most precious time
of all is time spent with your family.


1569
01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:41.794
Now, you know I'm supposed
to only be here through Christmas.


1570
01:24:43.171 --> 01:24:45.884
But I will conveniently
have a hip injury...


1571
01:24:46.528 --> 01:24:48.889
and stay to the year
2000 if I have to.

1572
01:24:49.357 --> 01:24:50.766
Do you understand
what I'm sayin' to you?


1573
01:24:50.827 --> 01:24:52.290
-I do now.
-Mm-hmm.


1574
01:24:52.833 --> 01:24:56.796
Look, I'm havin' a little trouble
tryin' to get through to Henry.


1575
01:24:56.857 --> 01:24:59.842
Now, Julia, on the other hand,
she's wonderful. She deserves...


1576
01:24:59.903 --> 01:25:02.997
What are you talkin' about what Julia
deserves and what she don't?


1577
01:25:03.657 --> 01:25:05.270
She's Henry's wife.

1578
01:25:06.801 --> 01:25:07.839
Don't worry. I...

1579
01:25:09.506 --> 01:25:11.587
I'm sure she'll forget me
as soon as I leave.


1580
01:25:12.594 --> 01:25:14.893
She'll forget herself
if you go on like this.


1581
01:25:15.916 --> 01:25:17.822
Marguerite, is that you?

1582
01:25:17.933 --> 01:25:19.239
I'm comin', Bessie!

1583
01:25:20.061 --> 01:25:21.119
Now, Dudley,

1584
01:25:21.886 --> 01:25:23.715
you are a charming person.

1585
01:25:25.521 --> 01:25:27.181
You go charm somebody else.

1586
01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:28.469
Okay?

1587
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:42.827
Bessie, I'm comin' in.

1588
01:25:44.759 --> 01:25:46.903
Did I tell you I quit smokin'?

1589
01:25:47.282 --> 01:25:49.681
I'm so proud of you, sugar.

1590
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:57.311
Watch it. Don't slip now.

1591
01:25:57.372 --> 01:25:58.773
Come on, babies, let's go.

1592
01:25:59.344 --> 01:26:01.722
Thank you so much. Now you
have a lot more room.


1593
01:26:02.608 --> 01:26:04.824
-Bye.
-Hi, Dudley!


1594
01:26:05.037 --> 01:26:07.179
I'm just baby-sitting Jeremiah.

1595
01:26:07.278 --> 01:26:11.210
-Mommy, Mommy! Here, puppy.
-Get away from that dog!


1596
01:26:11.271 --> 01:26:13.432
-Go ahead!
-Jeremiah! Jeremiah!


1597
01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:14.503
Saul!

1598
01:26:16.845 --> 01:26:17.772
Where's he goin'now?

1599
01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:21.147
Thank you so much for the ride.

1600
01:26:21.281 --> 01:26:22.898
I know you had to
go out of your way.

1601
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:25.034
The first five minutes
of The Nutcracker


1602
01:26:25.095 --> 01:26:26.443
hasn't changed any since last year.

1603
01:26:27.681 --> 01:26:29.898
I'll make 'em leave before the
bows so we can come and get you.


1604
01:26:29.959 --> 01:26:31.144
-Oh, thank you.

1605
01:26:33.323 --> 01:26:34.157
-Um...
-Um...


1606
01:26:36.927 --> 01:26:37.651
Thanks.

1607
01:26:37.737 --> 01:26:38.582
Okay.

1608
01:26:41.288 --> 01:26:43.551
-Bye-bye.
-Bye!


1609
01:26:43.724 --> 01:26:46.128
No time for that, Saul.
Come on, we're gonna be late.


1610
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:49.220
Oh, Santa, just leave
that man under my tree...


1611
01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:50.914

01:28:00.819 --> 01:28:02.228
The Keeleys live on Sixth.

1626
01:28:02.928 --> 01:28:06.114
Henry, the Keeleys live on Woodlawn.

1627
01:28:08.734 --> 01:28:09.465
You're jealous.

1628
01:28:10.095 --> 01:28:11.223
I am not jealous.

1629
01:28:11.284 --> 01:28:12.069
Yes, you are.

1630
01:28:12.204 --> 01:28:14.619
I may be a lot of things, but
jealous is not one of them.


1631
01:28:14.694 --> 01:28:15.510
Sure, you are.

1632
01:28:15.809 --> 01:28:17.530
You're so jealous, you
can't even think straight.


1633
01:28:17.591 --> 01:28:19.957
I am thinking just fine, thank you.

1634
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:22.158
You can't even remember
where the Keeleys live.


1635
01:28:22.219 --> 01:28:23.919
The Keeleys' house is on Sixth.

1636
01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:25.892
-Then what's it doing over there?
-What?


1637
01:28:27.746 --> 01:28:28.333
Hmm.

1638
01:28:32.785 --> 01:28:33.765
Keeleys moved.

1639
01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:37.048
Woodlawn. Sixth.

1640
01:28:38.143 --> 01:28:39.153
Is this it?

1641
01:28:39.463 --> 01:28:41.715
Mm-hmm. There's the house.

1642
01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:43.773
-Be careful, Henry.
-I will be.


1643
01:28:44.803 --> 01:28:47.526
Drive all this way,
they're probably not even home.


1644
01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:53.072
At least they could
shovel their walkway.


1645
01:28:54.813 --> 01:28:55.757
Whoooaaah!

1646
01:29:04.208 --> 01:29:05.083
Henry!

1647
01:29:08.246 --> 01:29:09.692
What are you laughin' at?

1648
01:29:12.003 --> 01:29:14.643
You look like a kid. 
Are you all right?

1649
01:29:14.717 --> 01:29:17.303
-I'm fine.
-Let me help you up.


1650
01:29:17.548 --> 01:29:18.437
Thanks, babe.

1651
01:29:20.615 --> 01:29:23.205
Oh, baby. What are you doing?

1652
01:29:23.266 --> 01:29:26.001
-I thought you was helpin' me up.
-You did this on purpose.


1653
01:29:28.333 --> 01:29:30.140
Eddie, come here quick.
It's the preacher.


1654
01:29:30.415 --> 01:29:33.722
-What's goin' on?
-I hope you didn't hurt yourself.


1655
01:29:34.364 --> 01:29:36.689
-You all right?
-We're fine.


1656
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:38.127
I told these kids to shovel that walk.

1657
01:29:38.188 --> 01:29:40.952
They ain't got nothin' on their mind
but Santa Claus. Sorry.


1658
01:29:42.285 --> 01:29:43.860
-This is yours. Merry Christmas.
-Us?


1659
01:29:44.094 --> 01:29:46.924
-Merry Christmas.
-God bless you.


1660
01:29:48.375 --> 01:29:50.463
-You'll catch cold. Be careful.
-We will.


1661
01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:51.695
I'll see you on Sunday.

1662
01:29:51.756 --> 01:29:53.624
We'll be there. All of us.

1663
01:29:57.754 --> 01:30:00.044
Seems like we've been
doin' this forever.


1664
01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:02.863
Forever is right.
Do you remember the first time?


1665
01:30:04.361 --> 01:30:05.890
-My mother was visiting, yeah.
-Yes.


1666
01:30:07.451 --> 01:30:10.615
-You know, Henry, she never liked me.
-No, no, that's not true.


1667
01:30:10.676 --> 01:30:13.735
She used to say, 'Girl, you better
get some meat on them there bones.'


1668
01:30:15.698 --> 01:30:17.366
Well, she just wanted
you to eat, that's all.


1669
01:30:17.427 --> 01:30:21.065
-No, she wanted me to be as fat as her.
-She wasn't that fat.


1670
01:30:21.126 --> 01:30:24.225
Henry, a policeman walk down the street,
see your mama and go, 'Break it up!'


1671
01:30:26.586 --> 01:30:27.272
Stop!

1672
01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:30.418
Stop it!

1673
01:30:31.361 --> 01:30:32.311
Rest her soul.

1674
01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.624
It's good to see you laugh again.

1675
01:30:39.529 --> 01:30:40.962
It's nice to have a reason to.

1676
01:30:43.547 --> 01:30:46.088
You know, I miss this Henry.

1677
01:30:48.327 --> 01:30:50.137
I wish he'd show up more often.

1678
01:31:04.092 --> 01:31:05.967
There. We did it.

1679
01:31:08.804 --> 01:31:11.776
I'm gonna go to the church for a minute.
You go on inside.


1680
01:31:20.049 --> 01:31:21.880
-There we go.
-Thank you.


1681
01:31:22.985 --> 01:31:24.075
Don't slip.

-We could sell ads.
-I think it could work.


1703
01:32:58.405 --> 01:33:00.184
-Sounds okay to me.
-Mr. Hamilton?


1704
01:33:02.169 --> 01:33:04.722
-Is that gonna slow us down?
-Excuse me, Mr. Hamilton.


1705
01:33:05.433 --> 01:33:07.929
-Yes, Bernita?
-Reverend Biggs is here to see you.


1706
01:33:10.459 --> 01:33:12.263
-Henry!
-Joe.


1707
01:33:16.362 --> 01:33:18.058
Uh... Joe... I need to speak with you.

1708
01:33:20.106 --> 01:33:20.822
Can we...

1709
01:33:20.954 --> 01:33:24.311
Go ahead. I have no secrets from
my own people here. In fact, sit down...


1710
01:33:24.372 --> 01:33:25.165
I've reconsidered.

1711
01:33:26.419 --> 01:33:27.339
I don't want the job.

1712
01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:31.268
-Let's go, guys.
-I can't leave my own people, Joe.


1713
01:33:31.584 --> 01:33:34.087
And they can't afford
to travel clear up here.


1714
01:33:34.148 --> 01:33:39.208
-And as far as moving, Julia and I...
-Henry, a deal is a deal.


1715
01:33:40.055 --> 01:33:41.904
My decision is final.

1716
01:33:42.261 --> 01:33:43.149
I'm sorry.

1717
01:33:44.516 --> 01:33:47.304
You're sorry.
Sorry is not good enough, Henry!


1718
01:33:49.489 --> 01:33:52.218
You don't get it, Henry.
I don't care about St. Matt's.


1719
01:33:52.785 --> 01:33:55.042
St. Matt's is where we've been,
not where we're going!


1720
01:33:55.103 --> 01:33:57.478
Only if people like you abandon it, Joe.

1721
01:34:03.922 --> 01:34:05.576
You know, it used to be
you couldn't just pick up...


1722
01:34:05.637 --> 01:34:08.791
and move away from your own people
as soon as you made a couple of bucks.


1723
01:34:09.815 --> 01:34:11.570
There was nowhere else for us to go.

1724
01:34:12.712 --> 01:34:14.784
But at least our kids
got to grow up with their heroes.


1725
01:34:14.845 --> 01:34:18.563
Look, Henry, I'm trying to be nice to you
because you and I go back a ways...


1726
01:34:19.612 --> 01:34:21.345
and the old reverend
was always real good to me.


1727
01:34:21.533 --> 01:34:24.043
But this is gonna happen
whether you want it to or not.


1728
01:34:24.116 --> 01:34:27.912
With all due respect, Joe,
how do you think you can make me...


1729
01:34:27.973 --> 01:34:31.016
Not you. The church. 
It's coming down.

1730
01:34:32.078 --> 01:34:33.375
What's coming down?

1731
01:34:33.436 --> 01:34:34.397
The church is...

1732
01:34:36.194 --> 01:34:39.992
Henry, do you know why I am
a trustee of a church I don't go to?


1733
01:34:40.967 --> 01:34:45.128
Because your deacons all came begging to me,
telling me how broke the church was.


1734
01:34:45.994 --> 01:34:47.003
I bought the mortgage.

1735
01:34:47.871 --> 01:34:48.599
That's right!

1736
01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:50.419
I own it, and it's coming down.

1737
01:34:50.543 --> 01:34:53.120
That land's worth a lot more
to me with nothing on it.


1738
01:34:53.196 --> 01:34:55.964
-You're gonna tear down my church?
-That's right.


1739
01:34:56.304 --> 01:34:59.182
That's right. A-And build
a mall and tennis courts.


1740
01:34:59.243 --> 01:35:00.129
Tennis courts?

1741
01:35:00.190 --> 01:35:02.296
Henry, we're gonna turn
that neighbourhood around,


1742
01:35:02.751 --> 01:35:05.530
attract some real money to that place.
-Oh, I see.


1743
01:35:05.591 --> 01:35:06.443
You see what I'm saying?

1744
01:35:07.072 --> 01:35:10.042
You think without me there to lead them,
the people will just cave in.


1745
01:35:10.876 --> 01:35:14.551
-That's why you got me here!
-No, Henry, I want you to lead them.


1746
01:35:14.792 --> 01:35:16.279
But into the future.

1747
01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:18.809
-Whose future, Joe? They
don't play much tennis.


1748
01:35:23.891 --> 01:35:26.075
Joe, come back to the church.

1749
01:35:26.382 --> 01:35:27.708
See exactly who you'll be hurting.

1750
01:35:27.769 --> 01:35:31.428
See their faces, their families, their...
their children, Joe.


1751
01:35:34.586 --> 01:35:36.926
People are a lot tougher
than you think, Henry.


1752
01:35:43.227 --> 01:35:44.206
Henry, look.

1753
01:35:45.101 --> 01:35:46.420
Come on, they'll survive.

1754
01:35:46.481 --> 01:35:50.200
And you still think you care
about the things we care about?


1755
01:35:55.045 --> 01:35:55.654
'Hark!

1756
01:35:56.198 --> 01:35:58.780
I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger.'

1757
01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:01.565
-That's what I say.
-Only louder.


1758
01:36:01.871 --> 01:36:02.446
'Hark!

1759
01:36:02.788 --> 01:36:05.720
I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger.'

1760
01:36:06.589 --> 01:36:09.043
Then Michael and Jessica come on...

1761
01:36:09.104 --> 01:36:12.098
and sing a really slow song.

1762
01:36:12.389 --> 01:36:15.339
It's not that slow,
and it's very pretty.


1763
01:36:16.139 --> 01:36:17.403
Meanin' to ask you,

1764
01:36:17.629 --> 01:36:19.726
you two have a fight last night?

1765
01:36:20.024 --> 01:36:22.033
No, Ma, we delivered Christmas baskets.

1766
01:36:22.132 --> 01:36:25.536
-The gym socks were a big hit.
-Huh! I knew they would be.


1767
01:36:26.269 --> 01:36:28.841
-That you were right about.
-Hi there.


1768
01:36:28.902 --> 01:36:30.184
-Henry.
-Hello.


1769
01:36:30.245 --> 01:36:31.998
Dad, Jason got sick,

1770
01:36:32.059 --> 01:36:35.743
and I'm gonna be a shepherd
in the nativity play.


1771
01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:40.741
-I won't have to say 'baaa.'
-Ohh.


1772
01:36:41.836 --> 01:36:42.793
That's great.

1773
01:36:43.029 --> 01:36:45.427
'Cause someone very special
is gonna be in the audience


1774
01:36:45.508 --> 01:36:48.187
-listening to every word you say.
-Huh?


1775
01:36:48.906 --> 01:36:51.290
Your mother and I figured out
what you'd like for Christmas.


1776
01:36:51.351 --> 01:36:52.138
-Yeah.

1777
01:36:53.381 --> 01:36:54.800
Did you wrap it up?

1778
01:36:55.555 --> 01:36:56.702
Not quite.

1779
01:36:58.899 --> 01:37:01.578
Hakim!

1780
01:37:02.845 --> 01:37:03.752
I missed you.

1781
01:37:07.256 --> 01:37:08.003
Ohhh.

1782
01:37:09.906 --> 01:37:12.431
Is he going to stay forever and ever?

1783
01:37:12.741 --> 01:37:16.064
Well, just 'til the new year.
Then after that, we'll see.


1784
01:37:20.250 --> 01:37:24.092
I have a secret to tell you.
My ambulance has a siren now.


1785
01:37:24.153 --> 01:37:24.956
Really?

1786
01:37:25.986 --> 01:37:27.764
God bless Mommy...

1787
01:37:28.512 --> 01:37:29.824
and Daddy...

1788
01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:32.821
And Grandma... 
And my grandma.

1789
01:37:33.455 --> 01:37:34.117
Amen.

1790
01:37:34.303 --> 01:37:35.315
Okay, guys, you ready?

1791
01:37:35.773 --> 01:37:39.254
We did our prayers. 'Cause we
were already on our knees.


1792
01:37:39.589 --> 01:37:40.594
Okay.

1793
01:37:41.372 --> 01:37:42.647
It's time to get into bed now.

1794
01:37:43.061 --> 01:37:43.767
Come on.

1795
01:37:46.021 --> 01:37:46.866
Boing!

1796
01:37:47.817 --> 01:37:48.686
All right.

1797
01:37:49.413 --> 01:37:50.277
Good night.

1798
01:37:50.393 --> 01:37:51.506
-Good night.
-Good night.


1799
01:37:52.608 --> 01:37:54.042
No talking late now.

1800
01:37:56.207 --> 01:37:58.332
Close the door, please.

1801
01:38:01.157 --> 01:38:01.978
Okay.

1802
01:38:05.628 --> 01:38:08.392
-Wait 'til you meet Dudley.
-Who's that?


1803
01:38:08.453 --> 01:38:11.024
-The man in the grey coat.
-Huh?


1804
01:38:11.113 --> 01:38:13.800
-You remember.
-Oh!


1805
01:38:19.834 --> 01:38:22.860
Christmas is supposed to be...

1806
01:38:23.225 --> 01:38:26.942
the most joyous day of the year.

1807
01:38:50.538 --> 01:38:52.632
-Henry?
-Hmm?


1808
01:38:53.354 --> 01:38:54.741
Would you like some hot chocolate?

1809
01:38:55.863 --> 01:38:56.931
No, thank you.

1810
01:38:57.318 --> 01:38:58.691
I've got to check the fuse box.

1811
01:38:59.414 --> 01:39:02.521
If we put any more lights on that tree,
we're gonna blow up the house.


1812
01:39:33.246 --> 01:39:36.267
Christmas is supposed to be the
most joyous day of the year.


1813
01:39:36.971 --> 01:39:39.473
But for St. Matt's,
it's a day to surrender.


1814
01:39:40.388 --> 01:39:44.317
Not because I'm going to preach
at another church, as some may believe...


1815
01:39:44.926 --> 01:39:48.249
but because the people who own
the building are going to tear it down.


1816
01:39:49.408 --> 01:39:52.161
Now, it's no one's fault.
There is no one to blame.


1817
01:39:52.605 --> 01:39:53.319
Henry.

1818
01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:56.932
It just seems as though despite
our best efforts, our dream...


1819
01:39:57.544 --> 01:40:00.380
my dream for St. Matthew's...
will not come to pass.


1820
01:40:00.441 --> 01:40:01.154
-Ohhh.

1821
01:40:01.487 --> 01:40:04.849
But let's remember the good things
we've shared over the years.


1822
01:40:05.305 --> 01:40:08.240
The laughter, the exploding boiler...

1823
01:40:08.514 --> 01:40:10.900
the sounds of voices raised to heaven.

1824
01:40:11.551 --> 01:40:12.390
I'll miss it all.

1825
01:40:12.764 --> 01:40:14.124
I thank you for your efforts.

1826
01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:16.203
I thank you for your friendship.

1827
01:40:17.838 --> 01:40:18.643
God bless you.

1828
01:40:19.936 --> 01:40:20.976
I love you all.

May I help you?
Good evening. I'm Rev. Biggs' assistant.


1839
01:41:08.692 --> 01:41:11.106
-Wait in the living room, please.
-Thank you.


1840
01:41:12.344 --> 01:41:13.820
Okay, Bernita, 
I'll take care of it.

1841
01:41:16.355 --> 01:41:17.459
I ain't buying!

1842
01:41:17.819 --> 01:41:19.835
For God's sake, it's Christmas Eve!

1843
01:41:20.299 --> 01:41:21.758
For the sake of God indeed.

1844
01:41:21.942 --> 01:41:23.065
Henry Biggs sent you here.

1845
01:41:23.706 --> 01:41:25.798
I told him he's through.
To hell with him.


1846
01:41:26.352 --> 01:41:28.049
No, to heaven with him, Joe.

1847
01:41:29.036 --> 01:41:31.008
That's a plan not even
you could mess up.


1848
01:41:31.570 --> 01:41:34.064
-Look, I don't know who you are, but...
-I'm an angel.


1849
01:41:35.828 --> 01:41:36.944
No, not yours.

1850
01:41:38.531 --> 01:41:42.490
No, I'm afraid yours
is a long way off.

1851
01:41:43.082 --> 01:41:45.680
I'm a very busy man,
and you're wasting my time.


1852
01:41:45.747 --> 01:41:48.070
Now, I'm giving 'em another church.
St. Matt's is...


1853
01:42:06.524 --> 01:42:07.720
What is this?

1854
01:42:08.821 --> 01:42:10.180
It's like your past, Joe.

1855
01:42:11.315 --> 01:42:13.662
You can walk away from it,
but it's still there.


1856
01:42:17.985 --> 01:42:19.873
What do you see when you
look at a place like this?


1857
01:42:20.138 --> 01:42:22.606
I'll tell you what I see.
Sterling Acres.


1858
01:42:22.667 --> 01:42:25.042
The latest development miracle
from Hamilton Realty.


1859
01:42:25.543 --> 01:42:27.551
I see 200 luxury apartments.

1860
01:42:27.906 --> 01:42:30.871
Over here, a 24-hour health club
right on the grounds.


1861
01:42:31.682 --> 01:42:34.104
-State of the art designer interiors.
-This thing is broken.


1862
01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:37.890
-The kind of home that you deserve.
-It's not even plugged in.


1863
01:42:38.867 --> 01:42:40.839
That's very smooth,
however you did all this.


1864
01:42:44.716 --> 01:42:45.805
But you gotta do better than that.

1865
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:48.773
Yeah...

1866
01:42:49.708 --> 01:42:50.941
you gotta do a lot better than that...

1867
01:42:52.283 --> 01:42:53.143
to get to me.

1868
01:42:57.174 --> 01:42:59.049
Have to do a whole lot better than that
to get to me.


1869
01:43:01.693 --> 01:43:02.859
Whoever you are.

1870
01:43:04.034 --> 01:43:05.374
Don't worry about who I am, Joe.

1871
01:43:06.837 --> 01:43:08.407
You won't even remember me tomorrow.

1872
01:43:09.026 --> 01:43:10.129
But remember this:

1873
01:43:12.326 --> 01:43:14.504
Look at the real price
before you close the deal.


1874
01:43:15.839 --> 01:43:18.473
-What's that supposed to mean?
-You know what it means.


1875
01:43:19.843 --> 01:43:21.861
Listen to your heart.
Do what it tells you.


1876
01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:24.203
You'll find your way.

1877
01:43:35.324 --> 01:43:36.228
Hark!

1878
01:43:36.778 --> 01:43:39.893
I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger.

1879
01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:44.589
Hark!

1880
01:43:44.650 --> 01:43:47.788
I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger.

1881
01:43:51.422 --> 01:43:54.983
Hark! I hear Joseph and
Mary in the manger.


1882
01:43:55.098 --> 01:43:56.613
Where's Joseph and Mary?

1883
01:43:59.636 --> 01:44:00.434
Ohhh.

1884
01:44:13.110 --> 01:44:16.343
See the infant, meek and mild.

1885
01:44:16.404 --> 01:44:20.305
He is God's anointed child.

1886
01:44:20.576 --> 01:44:23.082
So celebrate this Christmas morn.

1887
01:44:23.144 --> 01:44:27.547
For on this day, 
His son is born!

1888
01:44:30.532 --> 01:44:31.262
Julia.

1889
01:44:36.412 --> 01:44:38.586
I wanted to see you to say good-bye.

1890
01:44:39.229 --> 01:44:42.707
No, no. I'll call the council
and tell them that we still need you.


1891
01:44:42.819 --> 01:44:45.700
Well, this is over the council's head.

1892
01:44:47.778 --> 01:44:49.014
Way over their head.

1893
01:44:49.588 --> 01:44:50.634
Besides, it's time.

1894
01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:52.215
How can it be time?

1895
01:44:52.881 --> 01:44:53.966
It just is.

1896
01:44:55.650 --> 01:44:57.591
It's funny, you know,
I spent the last 30 years...


1897
01:44:57.652 --> 01:45:00.415
thinking I'd be happy
if I could just get back to this place.


1898
01:45:00.896 --> 01:45:01.517
Here?

1899
01:45:02.098 --> 01:45:04.839
The council must send you
to some dead neighbourhoods.


1900
01:45:05.121 --> 01:45:07.490
Well, dead is relative.

1901
01:45:09.112 --> 01:45:10.467
But now I know where I belong.

1902
01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:12.432
Is this because of me?

1903
01:45:12.722 --> 01:45:13.359
No.

1904
01:45:15.612 --> 01:45:16.377
Mmm.

1905
01:45:18.954 --> 01:45:20.602
Well, maybe just a little bit.

1906
01:45:21.156 --> 01:45:23.289
You remember when you
asked me what you do...


1907
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:25.730
when the flame between
two people goes out?


1908
01:45:27.677 --> 01:45:28.525
Yes.

1909
01:45:31.599 --> 01:45:32.549
The answer is:

1910
01:45:33.388 --> 01:45:34.274
You don't let it.

1911
01:45:39.013 --> 01:45:40.284
Will we ever see you again?

1912
01:45:43.559 --> 01:45:44.572
I don't know.

1913
01:45:46.210 --> 01:45:47.310
Well, let's see.

1914
01:45:47.696 --> 01:45:49.291
No. Not again.

-Mommy, was I good?
-Oh! The best donkey.


1947
01:48:28.754 --> 01:48:29.868
I'll do it.

1948
01:48:33.883 --> 01:48:34.797
Not bad, man.

1949
01:48:35.127 --> 01:48:36.757
Oh, yes!

1950
01:48:48.107 --> 01:48:50.803
'Christmas is supposed to be...

1951
01:48:51.214 --> 01:48:53.896
'the most joyous day of the year.'

1952
01:48:54.407 --> 01:48:55.917
Amen!

1953
01:48:56.449 --> 01:48:58.560
'But for St. Matthew's, today is...'

1954

'For St. Matt's...

today is supposed...'

1956
01:49:26.978 --> 01:49:27.684
Beloved...

1957
01:49:29.815 --> 01:49:31.875
God never promised us a perfect life.

1958
01:49:31.971 --> 01:49:33.675
Amen!

1959
01:49:35.163 --> 01:49:36.587
He's saving that for the hereafter.

1960
01:49:36.648 --> 01:49:38.480
-Oh, no!
-Amen!


1961
01:49:39.317 --> 01:49:40.775
While we're here on...

1962
01:49:41.722 --> 01:49:42.597
on this Earth...

1963
01:49:43.889 --> 01:49:45.734
there's some things
we just got to work for.


1964
01:49:47.225 --> 01:49:49.416
-Am I right about this?
-Yeah!


1965
01:49:49.635 --> 01:49:52.147
-I don't know. He's not following the script.
-He's doing fine.


1966
01:49:52.215 --> 01:49:54.084
-It could be a job.
-Uh-huh.


1967
01:49:54.226 --> 01:49:57.028
-It could be a church.
-Amen!


1968
01:49:58.043 --> 01:50:01.535
-It could be a community.
-Amen!


1969
01:50:01.647 --> 01:50:03.947
-Could be a marriage.
-Amen!


1970
01:50:04.449 --> 01:50:05.763
But the good news is...

1971
01:50:06.906 --> 01:50:09.483
is that He gave us... two secret
weapons to help us to succeed.


1972
01:50:11.397 --> 01:50:13.015
-Hope...
-Hope!


1973
01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:15.493
-And love.
-And love!


1974
01:50:16.968 --> 01:50:18.379
-Hope.
-Hope.


1975
01:50:19.850 --> 01:50:21.455
That's all a prayer is.

1976
01:50:23.153 --> 01:50:25.184
-And love.
-Love!


1977
01:50:27.017 --> 01:50:29.244
-Loving is giving...
-Yeah!


1978
01:50:29.699 --> 01:50:31.826
-Pure and simple.
-Amen!


1979
01:50:32.543 --> 01:50:35.578
But in love, there is also forgiveness.

1980
01:50:37.327 --> 01:50:38.498
And forgiveness...

1981
01:50:38.849 --> 01:50:40.196
belongs to everyone.

1982
01:50:40.678 --> 01:50:42.266
-It's a right.
-Yeah!


1983
01:50:42.327 --> 01:50:43.857
-Like a right to breathe..
-Yeah!


1984
01:50:43.931 --> 01:50:44.497
Or eat.

1985
01:50:46.934 --> 01:50:48.360
Or even to fall in love.

1986
01:50:48.966 --> 01:50:50.076
Amen!

1987
01:50:55.625 --> 01:50:56.667
Sometimes we...

1988
01:50:58.131 --> 01:50:59.508
we take love for granted.

1989
01:51:01.338 --> 01:51:02.709
Am I right about it?

1990
01:51:05.382 --> 01:51:07.228
Those who are nearest to us...

1991
01:51:09.298 --> 01:51:10.324
dearest to us...

1992
01:51:12.530 --> 01:51:14.130
those are the ones
we forget to cherish.


1993
01:51:16.301 --> 01:51:17.390
But the miracle is...

1994
01:51:19.383 --> 01:51:21.026
when we love someone...

1995
01:51:22.486 --> 01:51:24.163
we are really loving God.

1996
01:51:26.043 --> 01:51:26.851
Look...

1997
01:51:27.622 --> 01:51:30.148
in wonder at those you love for they...

1998
01:51:31.837 --> 01:51:32.850
are the face of God.

1999
01:51:33.378 --> 01:51:34.850
-Hallelujah.
-Hallelujah.


2000
01:51:36.713 --> 01:51:38.353
And when the path is dark...

2001
01:51:38.414 --> 01:51:40.667
-Amen.
-And the road bends...


2002
01:51:41.384 --> 01:51:43.765
we will let the
Lord show us the way.

2003
01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:48.266
-He will give us heart and make us whole.
-Amen!


2004
01:51:48.327 --> 01:51:49.422
You see, I know...

2005
01:51:50.155 --> 01:51:51.515
because He did me!

2006
01:51:51.668 --> 01:51:53.859
-Yeah!
-You may ask me,


2007
01:51:54.845 --> 01:51:56.592
-'How?'
-How?


2008
01:52:01.984 --> 01:52:02.766
You see, He's...

2009
01:52:06.462 --> 01:52:08.538
You see, He's got these angels...

2010
01:52:08.905 --> 01:52:13.318
-Yeah.
-Waitin' on this long line...


2011
01:52:13.729 --> 01:52:17.203
for the chance to come down
and help each and every one of us!


2012
01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:18.768
-And they do!
-Yes!


2013
01:52:18.829 --> 01:52:21.847
So you see, beloved,

2102
01:57:49.139 --> 01:57:51.148
I'm planning on getting
married in this church.

-To who?
-Who do you think?


2104
01:57:53.977 --> 01:57:55.965
You're my little lamb dumpling.

-Did he say 'lamb dumpling'?


2106
01:58:01.647 --> 01:58:03.364
I can't believe you
said that to the pastor.


2107
01:58:03.425 --> 01:58:07.071
Oh, well, the pastor's gonna have to
get himself a new secretary.


2108
01:58:07.191 --> 01:58:11.218
-I'm gonna have to pray on that.
-Joe, Merry Christmas.


2109
01:58:11.823 --> 01:58:12.812
You belong here, Henry.

2110
01:58:13.818 --> 01:58:15.876
Call me Monday. We'll work
that mortgage thing out.


2111
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:18.670
That's wonderful.

2112
01:58:19.503 --> 01:58:20.158

2113
01:58:21.163 --> 01:58:21.921
I will.

2114
01:58:21.982 --> 01:58:22.860
Henry, you did it!

2115
01:58:23.355 --> 01:58:24.668
No, honey, we did.

2116
01:58:26.157 --> 01:58:28.156
-Good sermon, Reverend.
-Merry Christmas.


2117
01:58:30.216 --> 01:58:31.329
Merry Christmas.

2118
01:58:32.263 --> 01:58:32.741
Who's that?

2119
01:58:32.802 --> 01:58:34.425
I don't know. Maybe he's
new in the neighbourhood.


2120
01:58:35.433 --> 01:58:37.479
Come on, boys! Let's go!

2121
01:58:38.282 --> 01:58:41.319
Hey, Merry Christmas, Dudley.

2122
01:58:41.385 --> 01:58:43.240
Merry Christmas to you, too, Jeremiah.

2123
01:58:43.768 --> 01:58:45.540
Lunch and presents. 
Come on, boys!

2124
01:58:45.601 --> 01:58:47.129
Jeremiah, give me your hand, honey.

2125
01:58:47.190 --> 01:58:49.633
Mom, did you get Dudley a present?

2126
01:58:50.414 --> 01:58:51.979
Jeremiah, who is Dudley, baby?

2127
01:58:52.142 --> 01:58:54.402
-Ma...
-Come on, boys, let's go get some soup.


2128
01:58:54.463 --> 01:58:56.575
you know Dudley.

2129
01:58:57.301 --> 01:59:01.103
That was a long time ago.
At least a year.


2130
01:59:01.306 --> 01:59:04.090
Before Hakim came
to live with us for good.


2131
01:59:04.151 --> 01:59:05.948
Wow!

2132
01:59:06.109 --> 01:59:08.737
And became my real brother.

2133
01:59:08.798 --> 01:59:09.527
It's beautiful!

2134
01:59:09.588 --> 01:59:11.681
You must've sat up with
that all night, baby.


2135
01:59:12.369 --> 01:59:14.978
-Mama, you didn't.
-With my back? Are you kidding?


2136
01:59:15.039 --> 01:59:17.865
My parents still think
I made Dudley up.


2137
01:59:18.595 --> 01:59:21.962
They say,
'If he's so real, then where is he?'


2138
01:59:23.111 --> 01:59:25.312
But just like I told Daddy...

2139
01:59:25.601 --> 01:59:27.830
just because you can't see the air...

2140
01:59:28.018 --> 01:59:30.418
doesn't stop you from breathing.

2141
01:59:30.834 --> 01:59:32.948
And just 'cause you can't see God...

2142
01:59:33.163 --> 01:59:35.305
it don't stop you from believing.

2143
01:59:35.366 --> 01:59:37.926
Then Daddy smiled and said...

2144
01:59:38.222 --> 01:59:41.558
