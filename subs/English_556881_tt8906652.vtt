1
00:00:24.068 --> 00:00:26.037
It's like,
barely even there.


2
00:00:27.404 --> 00:00:30.240
Yeah, not a
good night for moon tanning.


3
00:00:31.743 --> 00:00:32.908
What?

4
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.011
Moon tan.

5
00:00:36.814 --> 00:00:38.246
- Is that a thing?
- Yeah.


6
00:00:38.248 --> 00:00:40.752
It's like a suntan,
but with the moon.


7
00:00:43.687 --> 00:00:47.555
But, I mean, that's just
sunlight reflecting off the moon,


8
00:00:47.557 --> 00:00:52.029
so it's still just
like, just the sun.


9
00:00:53.697 --> 00:00:55.532
Then why do they
call it moonlight?


10
00:00:59.436 --> 00:01:00.204
I'll be damned.

11
00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:07.344
I don't wanna stay
out here much longer.


12
00:01:08.678 --> 00:01:10.780
I don't wanna get a moon burn.

13
00:01:12.616 --> 00:01:13.450
Oh shit.

14
00:01:26.596 --> 00:01:28.964
Mm, you make the best stew.

15
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:32.034
- You like it?
- Mmhmm.


16
00:01:32.036 --> 00:01:33.537
Okay, wow.

17
00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:36.540
Why wow?

18
00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:39.141
I'm just surprised,
that's all.


19
00:01:39.143 --> 00:01:40.144
Surprised by what?

20
00:01:42.914 --> 00:01:45.216
I uh, I didn't know
that you liked turtle.


21
00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:49.717
- That's not even funny.
- I'm not being funny.


22
00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.619
- Barry, stop.
- I can't stop.


23
00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:53.255
There is a turtle, in your bowl.

24
00:01:53.257 --> 00:01:54.990
- Take it back.
- I can't take it back.


25
00:01:54.992 --> 00:01:56.524
- Take it back.
- I can't take it back.


26
00:01:56.526 --> 00:01:58.129
- Take it back.
- I can't.


27
00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:00.231
Joke's on you.

28
00:02:01.331 --> 00:02:04.066
I love the taste of turtle.

29
00:02:04.068 --> 00:02:04.936
Mm, mm, mm!

30
00:02:53.783 --> 00:02:55.284
Hey, Steve.

31
00:02:55.286 --> 00:02:56.287
Oh, hey Bar.

32
00:02:58.521 --> 00:02:59.489
- Thanks.
- Thanks.


33
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.158
Lovely weather
we're having, today.


34
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.126
What?

35
00:03:04.128 --> 00:03:05.895
The weather, it's nice.

36
00:03:05.897 --> 00:03:09.530
Oh, uh, sure.

37
00:03:09.532 --> 00:03:10.567
Gonna be hot.

38
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.369
What?

39
00:03:13.371 --> 00:03:14.738
It's gonna be hot.

40
00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:19.008
- It's uh, hot every day.
- Yeah.


41
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.843
Humid heat.

42
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.511
Uh huh.

43
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.185
Well, I'm gonna go
inside, cause of the heat.


44
00:03:30.321 --> 00:03:32.754
Right, see you around, huh?

45
00:03:32.756 --> 00:03:33.590
Sure.

46
00:03:57.447 --> 00:03:59.014
Motherfu

47
00:03:59.016 --> 00:04:00.882
Barry Klein does little
more than spit out a line,


48
00:04:00.884 --> 00:04:02.850
as if he's reading a textbook.

49
00:04:02.852 --> 00:04:06.923
His character portrayal
is mind-numbingly dull.


50
00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:11.360
But where Barry Klein is
lacking in his performance,


51
00:04:11.362 --> 00:04:14.063
it's made up for
by the true stars


52
00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:15.930
of the Austin Theater community,

53
00:04:15.932 --> 00:04:19.201
especially in Kimberly Lee's
heartwrenching portrayal


54
00:04:19.203 --> 00:04:21.372
of the grieving mother.

55
00:04:23.274 --> 00:04:24.406
Where does this guy get off?

56
00:04:24.408 --> 00:04:25.873
It's just one man's opinion.

57
00:04:25.875 --> 00:04:26.776
But he's wrong.

58
00:04:27.944 --> 00:04:29.044
Heartwrenching?

59
00:04:29.046 --> 00:04:31.246
Babe, I'm proud of you, okay?

60
00:04:31.248 --> 00:04:33.382
Go out there tonight,
do your thing,


61
00:04:33.384 --> 00:04:35.250
and don't give a shit
about what anybody says,


62
00:04:35.252 --> 00:04:37.721
especially, Steven Dordoff?

63
00:04:38.888 --> 00:04:40.222
Is that even a real name?

64
00:04:40.224 --> 00:04:42.057
Yeah, it's a real name.

65
00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:44.059
A real shitty one.

66
00:04:44.061 --> 00:04:45.096
A real shitty review.

67
00:04:46.596 --> 00:04:47.829
Anyway, I need you to help me

68
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:49.333
take some pieces into
the gallery today.


69
00:04:50.967 --> 00:04:52.567
- Do I have to?
- Yes, you do.


70
00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:53.835
Why?

71
00:04:53.837 --> 00:04:55.337
'Cause if you don't,
I'll have to kill you.


72
00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:56.938
- Ooh.
- And then,


73
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.905
I'll have to commit suicide.

74
00:04:57.907 --> 00:04:59.276
- Murder suicide.
- Oh, damn.


75
00:05:00.211 --> 00:05:01.445
- Do you want that?
- No.


76
00:05:02.512 --> 00:05:03.978
Do you really
want me to be dead?


77
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.614
No.

78
00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.149
Is Jamie gonna be there?

79
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:08.217
Probably.

80
00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:09.318
Oh, but I don't like her.

81
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.585
Well, you don't like anybody.

82
00:05:10.587 --> 00:05:11.953
Well I especially
don't like her.


83
00:05:11.955 --> 00:05:15.126
Me neither.

84
00:05:22.033 --> 00:05:22.997
- Whoa.
- Whoa, watch it!


85
00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.700
Jesus.

86
00:05:24.801 --> 00:05:26.634
Fuckin' Californians.

87
00:05:56.633 --> 00:05:57.468
Hey Susie.

88
00:05:58.502 --> 00:06:01.838
Hi Phyl, sorry I
didn't see you there.


89
00:06:04.974 --> 00:06:05.907
Is Jamie here?

90
00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:08.544
Yup, she's in the back.

91
00:06:08.546 --> 00:06:09.911
Fuckin' hell, here.

92
00:06:09.913 --> 00:06:11.045
Take these.

93
00:06:11.047 --> 00:06:12.713
- No, just...
- I'm stayin' here.


94
00:06:12.715 --> 00:06:13.549
With her?

95
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:15.685
Yeah, with me?

96
00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:19.223
Make it quick.

97
00:06:26.663 --> 00:06:27.730
Oh my God.

98
00:06:28.865 --> 00:06:30.167
It's gorgeous.

99
00:06:31.202 --> 00:06:32.667
The last stuff you
brought in was garbage,


100
00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:34.836
but this is really nice.

101
00:06:34.838 --> 00:06:35.837
Thanks.

102
00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:38.207
I've been inspired recently.

103
00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:39.042
It shows.

104
00:06:40.777 --> 00:06:42.177
Whatcha readin'?

105
00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:43.012
A story.

106
00:06:44.548 --> 00:06:46.517
No shit, a story?

107
00:06:47.851 --> 00:06:48.685
Uh huh.

108
00:06:50.854 --> 00:06:52.389
What's it about?

109
00:06:53.623 --> 00:06:57.058
Okay, so this
couple's been together


110
00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.230
since high school, and she got
an incurable blood disease,


111
00:07:01.232 --> 00:07:02.697
and she died.

112
00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:04.932
You know, sell a few of these
and you'll be a real artist.


113
00:07:04.934 --> 00:07:07.202
I am a real artist.

114
00:07:07.204 --> 00:07:09.737
What?

115
00:07:09.739 --> 00:07:14.744
Before that, her husband,
or boyfriend, or whatever,


116
00:07:17.214 --> 00:07:20.382
he's like a photographer, and
so he went to the hospital,


117
00:07:20.384 --> 00:07:23.718
and took pictures of her, in
the last days of her life.


118
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.455
You know, with like,
the black and white,


119
00:07:26.457 --> 00:07:28.559
and the light, and shit?

120
00:07:30.594 --> 00:07:32.793
I have a house full
of art that I made


121
00:07:32.795 --> 00:07:33.995
with my own two hands.

122
00:07:33.997 --> 00:07:35.830
This is an actual piece
of art that I made,


123
00:07:35.832 --> 00:07:37.031
I am a real artist.

124
00:07:37.033 --> 00:07:38.400
Why are you
trying to fight me?


125
00:07:38.402 --> 00:07:39.501
I'm not.

126
00:07:39.503 --> 00:07:42.273
I mean, that is
so fucking romantic.


127
00:07:43.574 --> 00:07:47.775
I wish that my boyfriend put
half that effort into anything.


128
00:07:47.777 --> 00:07:49.244
I don't have time for this.

129
00:07:49.246 --> 00:07:50.811
I have a huge fucking
gallery opening tomorrow,


130
00:07:50.813 --> 00:07:52.079
which maybe you know
something about,


131
00:07:52.081 --> 00:07:54.349
because your art
is hanging in it.


132
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:57.685
I have a shit ton of work
to do to get ready for it.


133
00:07:57.687 --> 00:08:00.855
All right, can I help you?

134
00:08:00.857 --> 00:08:03.092
Yeah, that would
actually be really great.


135
00:08:04.295 --> 00:08:05.762
Some girls just
have all the luck.


136
00:08:07.797 --> 00:08:08.798
But she's dead.

137
00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:10.833
Your point?

138
00:08:13.504 --> 00:08:15.537
Barry, what are
you doing here?


139
00:08:15.539 --> 00:08:17.508
Jamie, nice to see you.

140
00:08:19.543 --> 00:08:20.975
All right, don't be mad.

141
00:08:20.977 --> 00:08:22.176
What?

142
00:08:22.178 --> 00:08:24.047
I think I'm gonna stay here
and help with the opening.


143
00:08:25.815 --> 00:08:26.617
You sure?

144
00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:29.953
She seems particularly
vicious today.


145
00:08:30.787 --> 00:08:32.554
Yes, and yes.

146
00:08:32.556 --> 00:08:36.458
Okay, well, I would
offer to stay and help,


147
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.894
but I hate her, and I
don't wanna do that.


148
00:08:39.896 --> 00:08:41.829
All right, break a leg.

149
00:08:41.831 --> 00:08:42.666
I'll try.

150
00:08:54.143 --> 00:08:55.142
Hey.

151
00:08:55.144 --> 00:08:55.977
Oh, hey Barry.

152
00:08:55.979 --> 00:08:57.144
Did you see the review?

153
00:08:57.146 --> 00:08:57.981
Yep.

154
00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:02.253
- I'm gonna go get dressed.
- You're so talented.


155
00:09:06.423 --> 00:09:07.522
Hey man.

156
00:09:07.524 --> 00:09:08.823
Hey, Barry.

157
00:09:08.825 --> 00:09:10.191
Did you see the review, man?

158
00:09:10.193 --> 00:09:11.993
Yeah, I saw the review.

159
00:09:11.995 --> 00:09:13.062
Damn, well,

160
00:09:14.665 --> 00:09:15.599
We'll talk later.

161
00:09:26.242 --> 00:09:27.409
Oh, come on, guys.

162
00:09:27.411 --> 00:09:30.345
Oh, sorry Bar.

163
00:09:30.347 --> 00:09:31.582
Hey, Barry.

164
00:09:32.616 --> 00:09:34.451
Kim, David.

165
00:09:35.686 --> 00:09:36.919
Did you see the review?

166
00:09:39.255 --> 00:09:40.089
Yep.

167
00:09:42.058 --> 00:09:43.059
Can't win 'em all.

168
00:09:45.128 --> 00:09:45.962
Nope.

169
00:09:47.731 --> 00:09:50.565
We're uh, we're gonna, we're
just gonna get outta your hair,


170
00:09:50.567 --> 00:09:52.933
let you have the
space to prepare.


171
00:09:52.935 --> 00:09:54.268
Thanks.

172
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.972
Oh, look, fuck that
guy, am I right?


173
00:09:57.974 --> 00:09:59.308
- Yeah.
- Right.


174
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.311
No, no no.

175
00:10:02.912 --> 00:10:04.080
Fuck that guy.

176
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.417
Yeah.

177
00:10:08.419 --> 00:10:09.917
Break a leg.

178
00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:12.055
Where'd she, uh, where'd she go?

179
00:10:19.896 --> 00:10:20.828
Hi, are you Tom?

180
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:21.998
- Yep, Phyllis?
- Yes.


181
00:10:25.001 --> 00:10:26.300
Thank you.

182
00:10:26.302 --> 00:10:27.738
- No problem, headin' south?
- Yessir.


183
00:10:46.956 --> 00:10:50.091
I've been very
into manifesting, lately.


184
00:10:50.093 --> 00:10:51.760
What's that?

185
00:10:51.762 --> 00:10:54.463
Manifesting,
like vision boards?


186
00:10:54.465 --> 00:10:57.264
It's all about the
laws of attraction.


187
00:10:57.266 --> 00:10:59.801
There's this higher
plane of existence,


188
00:10:59.803 --> 00:11:02.169
where your desires
are not just a wish,


189
00:11:02.171 --> 00:11:05.507
but they're actually reality.

190
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:08.810
Identifying your visions,
and giving them clarity,


191
00:11:08.812 --> 00:11:12.313
and then focusing
on that clarity,


192
00:11:12.315 --> 00:11:14.850
will manifest what you
truly want in life.


193
00:11:14.852 --> 00:11:17.486
If you refuse the outside
world, and prevent it


194
00:11:17.488 --> 00:11:19.987
from distracting you
from your intentions,


195
00:11:19.989 --> 00:11:22.493
you can achieve
anything you want.


196
00:11:23.694 --> 00:11:25.294
That's how I got this part.

197
00:11:26.397 --> 00:11:28.998
That sounds like bullshit.

198
00:11:30.233 --> 00:11:31.234
It's not.

199
00:11:32.403 --> 00:11:35.704
I read it in a
book, and it works.


200
00:11:35.706 --> 00:11:37.171
That's how I got this part.

201
00:11:37.173 --> 00:11:39.006
You got this part
because you were sl...


202
00:11:39.008 --> 00:11:44.044
Right, well, I wanna
congratulate everybody,


203
00:11:44.046 --> 00:11:46.515
on a very successful run.

204
00:11:46.517 --> 00:11:49.183
Speech!

205
00:11:49.185 --> 00:11:54.157
Um, I know some of you have
probably read the reviews,


206
00:11:55.324 --> 00:12:00.229
but I wanna say that
I'm proud of you.


207
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:09.038
In a time when space is limited,
it's, you know, hey, hey,


208
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.943
♪ All the world
is but a stage ♪

209
00:12:23.454 --> 00:12:26.890
Life, life is a performance.

210
00:12:29.425 --> 00:12:30.594
Life is love.

211
00:12:32.596 --> 00:12:35.364
Art, art is love.

212
00:12:38.469 --> 00:12:39.903
Love art, and you love life.

213
00:12:41.437 --> 00:12:44.475
More importantly,
love art in yourself.


214
00:13:07.664 --> 00:13:09.965
Mm, you're home.

215
00:13:09.967 --> 00:13:11.298
You fell asleep.

216
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.570
- Yep.
- Come on, let's go to bed.


217
00:13:15.171 --> 00:13:16.005
Carry me.

218
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.005
Okay, but piggy-back style.

219
00:13:18.007 --> 00:13:19.643
- Really?
- Yeah, let's do it.


220
00:13:21.645 --> 00:13:25.514
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

221
00:14:10.226 --> 00:14:11.060
How's this?

222
00:14:12.863 --> 00:14:14.228
Great.

223
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.196
Do I look like a
relaxed and friendly guy?


224
00:14:16.198 --> 00:14:17.164
Yes.

225
00:14:17.166 --> 00:14:18.969
Do I look like a hipster dad?

226
00:14:20.136 --> 00:14:21.368
Yes.

227
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:22.204
Good.

228
00:14:34.183 --> 00:14:34.985
Barry?

229
00:14:38.989 --> 00:14:40.891
- Stand on the X.
- Yeah.


230
00:14:46.162 --> 00:14:49.030
Okay, look straight into the
camera, and slate your name.


231
00:14:49.032 --> 00:14:50.331
Barry Klein.

232
00:14:50.333 --> 00:14:52.499
Hands and two
profiles, please.


233
00:14:52.501 --> 00:14:53.870
Um, no, hands first.

234
00:15:05.348 --> 00:15:06.848
Okay, great.

235
00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:08.950
And the agency wants to
see a little personality,


236
00:15:08.952 --> 00:15:10.351
get to know you a bit.

237
00:15:10.353 --> 00:15:12.754
So I'm gonna ask you a question,
and I want you to answer


238
00:15:12.756 --> 00:15:14.555
straight to the lens.

239
00:15:14.557 --> 00:15:17.961
And try to be helpful, but not
pushy and standoffish, okay?


240
00:15:18.962 --> 00:15:21.029
What's in your
refrigerator right now?


241
00:15:21.031 --> 00:15:25.767
Oh God, um, eggs, cheese
slices, almond milk,


242
00:15:25.769 --> 00:15:29.138
um, oh, half a box of wine.

243
00:15:31.108 --> 00:15:33.942
I don't drink wine,
personally, but my wife does,


244
00:15:33.944 --> 00:15:35.977
and she likes to take
the bag out of the box,


245
00:15:35.979 --> 00:15:38.278
and just drink it
straight from the spout.


246
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.216
She calls it her
adult juice box.


247
00:15:41.051 --> 00:15:41.818
Okay, great.

248
00:15:43.586 --> 00:15:44.819
Do you think
this guy looks sad?


249
00:15:44.821 --> 00:15:48.422
I don't like his
hair very much.


250
00:15:48.424 --> 00:15:50.157
Um, ask him a
different question,


251
00:15:50.159 --> 00:15:52.894
and this time can he not be
so sad-looking in the eyes?


252
00:15:52.896 --> 00:15:55.797
And ask him if he'd
be willing to shave.


253
00:15:55.799 --> 00:15:56.667
I love shaving.

254
00:15:59.635 --> 00:16:00.669
Are you willing to shave?

255
00:16:00.671 --> 00:16:03.272
I yal, I, yes, I'll shave.

256
00:16:05.108 --> 00:16:07.441
Okay, let's try that
again, and this time,


257
00:16:07.443 --> 00:16:10.511
try not to be so pouty
and sad in the eyes, okay?


258
00:16:10.513 --> 00:16:12.413
They don't want
you to be pathetic.


259
00:16:12.415 --> 00:16:13.249
You're happy!

260
00:16:14.851 --> 00:16:17.651
So, you'll shave, if you
were offered this part?


261
00:16:17.653 --> 00:16:19.756
I would shave if I
was offered the part.


262
00:16:20.924 --> 00:16:22.157
That's as good
as it's gonna get.


263
00:16:22.159 --> 00:16:23.657
Let's move on.

264
00:16:23.659 --> 00:16:25.093
Good.

265
00:16:25.095 --> 00:16:26.997
And Barry, what's your
favorite thing in the world?


266
00:16:27.998 --> 00:16:32.366
Hm.

267
00:16:47.117 --> 00:16:48.682
Hey Barry.

268
00:16:48.684 --> 00:16:50.486
God, you scared
the shit outta me.


269
00:16:52.889 --> 00:16:54.323
Do you like this painting?

270
00:16:57.127 --> 00:16:58.525
It's different.

271
00:16:58.527 --> 00:16:59.361
It's mine.

272
00:17:02.665 --> 00:17:03.699
I should've known.

273
00:17:09.906 --> 00:17:10.807
You're Phyllis.

274
00:17:11.875 --> 00:17:13.474
Yep.

275
00:17:13.476 --> 00:17:15.478
Hm, thought it was that lady.

276
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:21.216
No.

277
00:17:21.218 --> 00:17:22.185
You're an artist?

278
00:17:23.252 --> 00:17:24.087
I am.

279
00:17:27.891 --> 00:17:28.724
What is it?

280
00:17:29.993 --> 00:17:32.559
They're um, they're collages.

281
00:17:32.561 --> 00:17:33.729
Oh, like a scrapbook.

282
00:17:35.431 --> 00:17:37.498
More like an assemblage
of different forms,


283
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.201
and different techniques,
that when utilized together,


284
00:17:40.203 --> 00:17:42.873
make a wholly new,
unique work of art.


285
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.441
What do they mean?

286
00:17:46.609 --> 00:17:48.677
They can mean whatever
you want them to mean.


287
00:17:49.712 --> 00:17:50.546
That's art.

288
00:17:52.916 --> 00:17:55.884
What does art mean to you?

289
00:17:55.886 --> 00:18:00.791
Well, good art is an expression,
where you share the world


290
00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:08.263
to someone in a way that,
maybe they've known, but um,


291
00:18:08.265 --> 00:18:09.698
never really experienced.

292
00:18:13.435 --> 00:18:16.039
Have you experienced the
world in a way I haven't?


293
00:18:20.143 --> 00:18:22.643
I don't, I don't know.

294
00:18:22.645 --> 00:18:24.145
Okay.

295
00:18:24.147 --> 00:18:25.816
Well, bye.

296
00:18:43.732 --> 00:18:45.399
Stop eating so much cheese.

297
00:18:45.401 --> 00:18:47.570
I can eat as much
cheese as I wanna eat.


298
00:18:48.604 --> 00:18:50.071
I can see
what they're goin' for,


299
00:18:50.073 --> 00:18:52.506
but it's just not there.

300
00:18:52.508 --> 00:18:55.243
Yeah, she's really
struggling to be someone,


301
00:18:55.245 --> 00:18:59.280
instead of just embracing
the chaos of uncertainty.


302
00:18:59.282 --> 00:19:02.416
Right, you can tell that
the artist is conflicted,


303
00:19:02.418 --> 00:19:04.520
has no idea what she's doing.

304
00:19:05.754 --> 00:19:07.588
Plus, it's
just boring, mediocre,


305
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.758
and lacks any kind of identity.

306
00:19:11.027 --> 00:19:13.094
- Eh, it's garbage.
- Total garbage.


307
00:19:13.096 --> 00:19:16.867
No, no, but it's
actually garbage, though.


308
00:19:18.001 --> 00:19:20.301
It's got, like,
pieces of trash in it.


309
00:19:20.303 --> 00:19:22.803
Huh, would you look at that.

310
00:19:22.805 --> 00:19:23.804
Oh, God.

311
00:19:46.997 --> 00:19:48.198
Barry, we're leaving.

312
00:19:51.001 --> 00:19:52.666
- Where are you going?
- Home.


313
00:19:52.668 --> 00:19:53.736
You can't take that.

314
00:19:58.241 --> 00:19:59.075
Fuck you.

315
00:20:11.687 --> 00:20:13.754
Oh, hey, whoa whoa whoa
whoa, what's up, what's up?


316
00:20:13.756 --> 00:20:15.089
I can't get my shoe off!

317
00:20:15.091 --> 00:20:17.928
- Okay, okay, this shoe?
- Yes this shoe,


318
00:20:18.727 --> 00:20:21.229
Barry, yes, this shoe.

319
00:20:21.231 --> 00:20:24.698
Hey, you don't have
to cry about a shoe.


320
00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.100
I can cry if I want.

321
00:20:26.102 --> 00:20:29.736
No, yes, yes yes
yes, you can, you can.


322
00:20:29.738 --> 00:20:31.874
But don't cry here.

323
00:20:33.109 --> 00:20:35.442
This is a terrible place to cry.

324
00:20:35.444 --> 00:20:37.444
There's good places to cry
and there's bad places to cry,


325
00:20:37.446 --> 00:20:39.715
and this is a terrible,
bad place to cry.


326
00:21:12.315 --> 00:21:14.550
I shoulda
gotten a job in finance.


327
00:21:15.918 --> 00:21:17.617
Like taxes, and shit?

328
00:21:17.619 --> 00:21:18.455
Uh huh.

329
00:21:22.158 --> 00:21:23.324
You don't think I could do it.

330
00:21:23.326 --> 00:21:24.425
Mm mm.

331
00:21:24.427 --> 00:21:26.129
No, you're not cut out for that.

332
00:21:27.163 --> 00:21:28.597
I'm not cut out for acting.

333
00:21:30.266 --> 00:21:33.134
We're just a couple
of talentless hacks.


334
00:21:33.136 --> 00:21:35.236
No, we're not talentless.

335
00:21:35.238 --> 00:21:36.905
They're tasteless and tactless.

336
00:21:41.577 --> 00:21:44.678
Y'know, I was feelin'
pretty bad, there.


337
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.515
Cause I was getting
all the criticism.


338
00:21:47.783 --> 00:21:49.450
But now that you're
the worst artist,


339
00:21:50.986 --> 00:21:54.957
and I'm the worst actor, we're
like, at the top of our game.


340
00:22:00.163 --> 00:22:01.431
It's different with art.

341
00:22:03.099 --> 00:22:05.768
You could get a bad review
cause of a shitty director.


342
00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:10.005
With art, it's just me.

343
00:22:14.044 --> 00:22:16.676
So you think people
are the problem?


344
00:22:16.678 --> 00:22:18.979
Yes, people are
absolutely the problem.


345
00:22:18.981 --> 00:22:21.717
Like, I wanna get away
from all the people.


346
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.554
I could take a vacation.

347
00:22:26.688 --> 00:22:27.524
Go to the beach.

348
00:22:29.392 --> 00:22:30.726
Sand in the toes.

349
00:22:32.062 --> 00:22:33.829
Sun rising above the Gulf.

350
00:22:35.198 --> 00:22:37.631
Is there such a thing
as a vacation from people?


351
00:22:37.633 --> 00:22:40.368
Like, get me away
from all the people


352
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.405
for a little bit, I'm good.

353
00:22:48.244 --> 00:22:49.743
Is that what you truly want?

354
00:22:49.745 --> 00:22:51.514
I truly want that, yes.

355
00:22:52.415 --> 00:22:53.216
Manifest it.

356
00:22:55.918 --> 00:22:57.418
Manifest it.

357
00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.190
You put it out in the universe,
and it becomes reality.


358
00:23:01.491 --> 00:23:03.357
- Yeah?
- Mmhmm.


359
00:23:03.359 --> 00:23:04.194
Okay.

360
00:23:08.764 --> 00:23:13.367
Oh, cosmic universe, unburden me

361
00:23:13.369 --> 00:23:18.038
from the plague of
societal obligation.


362
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.676
Rid the planet of
all the people.


363
00:23:23.213 --> 00:23:26.014
I eschew the naysayers,
and the critics,


364
00:23:27.716 --> 00:23:31.521
and let me live out my
final days in solitude.


365
00:23:32.455 --> 00:23:33.289
With Barry.

366
00:23:36.758 --> 00:23:40.130
Did it work?

367
00:23:42.798 --> 00:23:44.298
I don't, I really don't know,

368
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.134
cause I don't speak the
language of the universe.


369
00:23:46.136 --> 00:23:47.868
Oh my.

370
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.872
Well, it's worth a shot.

371
00:23:55.077 --> 00:23:56.776
Did you have
any dreams last night?


372
00:23:56.778 --> 00:23:58.645
Yes, one.

373
00:23:58.647 --> 00:24:00.548
- You were a turtle.
- I've always wanted


374
00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:03.386
- to be a turtle.
- And I was a dove.


375
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.256
But I was in a house, in a
cage, and you were outside,


376
00:24:08.258 --> 00:24:10.090
and you weren't in a cage.

377
00:24:10.092 --> 00:24:14.262
But you were walking by,
slowly, because you're a turtle.


378
00:24:14.264 --> 00:24:15.998
And I was singing like an angel.

379
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.899
And you heard me
through an open window,


380
00:24:18.901 --> 00:24:20.066
and you fell in love with me,

381
00:24:20.068 --> 00:24:22.470
even though you couldn't see me.

382
00:24:22.472 --> 00:24:23.803
And you were outside and free,

383
00:24:23.805 --> 00:24:25.506
and could do
whatever you wanted.


384
00:24:25.508 --> 00:24:29.610
Go to Greece, or Antarctica.

385
00:24:29.612 --> 00:24:32.812
- Do turtles like the cold?
- Doesn't matter,


386
00:24:32.814 --> 00:24:34.948
cause you didn't go.

387
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:36.783
You started climbing the
front stairs of the house,


388
00:24:36.785 --> 00:24:37.753
straight to me.

389
00:24:39.788 --> 00:24:41.322
But your little turtle
legs were too short


390
00:24:41.324 --> 00:24:43.324
to make it up the stairs.

391
00:24:43.326 --> 00:24:44.826
But you tried, anyway.

392
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.863
Forever.

393
00:24:50.866 --> 00:24:52.100
Until you died.

394
00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:56.104
I don't think I
like your dream.


395
00:24:58.341 --> 00:25:01.009
Well it's my dream, not yours.

396
00:25:03.346 --> 00:25:04.179
True.

397
00:25:19.295 --> 00:25:21.229
Hey, babe, I think they forgot

398
00:25:21.231 --> 00:25:23.297
to deliver the
paper this morning.


399
00:25:23.299 --> 00:25:25.198
I'm gonna run to the store.

400
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.034
Okay.

401
00:27:30.859 --> 00:27:32.495
- Hey babe?
- Mmhmm?


402
00:27:33.763 --> 00:27:34.996
Is it a holiday?

403
00:27:36.331 --> 00:27:37.433
Nope.

404
00:27:46.341 --> 00:27:48.542
Weird.

405
00:27:48.544 --> 00:27:49.379
Why?

406
00:27:50.813 --> 00:27:54.214
Well, the store was closed,
and there's nobody outside.


407
00:27:54.216 --> 00:27:55.551
What do you mean, nobody?

408
00:28:41.263 --> 00:28:42.097
Steve?

409
00:29:50.933 --> 00:29:53.501
Hi, this is Jamie,
with Artists' Space gallery.


410
00:29:53.503 --> 00:29:55.638
Leave me a message and
I'll call you back.


411
00:29:57.305 --> 00:29:58.508
Straight to voicemail.

412
00:30:35.611 --> 00:30:36.679
It's impossible.

413
00:30:37.947 --> 00:30:38.714
Apparently not.

414
00:30:42.117 --> 00:30:44.452
But, we were joking.

415
00:30:45.621 --> 00:30:46.989
It was a joke!

416
00:30:48.056 --> 00:30:48.858
Evidently not.

417
00:30:56.699 --> 00:30:59.067
Was, was there an evacuation?

418
00:31:02.203 --> 00:31:04.406
We would've heard
about it, wouldn't we?


419
00:31:17.887 --> 00:31:19.354
Maybe, we're hallucinating.

420
00:31:23.191 --> 00:31:25.260
We're both hallucinating
the same thing?


421
00:31:37.205 --> 00:31:38.373
Maybe it's a dream.

422
00:31:40.241 --> 00:31:45.246
And my mind is telling me
you're here, and I can feel you,


423
00:31:49.619 --> 00:31:51.954
but I can't actually feel you.

424
00:31:56.025 --> 00:31:56.792
Maybe?

425
00:32:00.462 --> 00:32:02.732
No, but when you
dream, you don't,


426
00:32:03.799 --> 00:32:05.099
you don't know
you're having a dream


427
00:32:05.101 --> 00:32:06.399
when you're in the dream.

428
00:32:06.401 --> 00:32:08.570
You don't know you had a
dream until you wake up.


429
00:32:11.239 --> 00:32:12.908
And you've already
had it, right?


430
00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:16.910
Then what the fuck is it?

431
00:33:57.847 --> 00:33:58.646
Fuck.

432
00:35:29.737 --> 00:35:30.572
Hey Bar?

433
00:35:31.773 --> 00:35:32.607
Barry.

434
00:35:34.844 --> 00:35:35.677
Bar.

435
00:35:54.495 --> 00:35:55.331
Barry?

436
00:36:36.638 --> 00:36:37.472
Phyl?

437
00:36:38.473 --> 00:36:39.308
Phyl?

438
00:36:40.541 --> 00:36:42.378
Oh my God!

439
00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.182
What's goin' on?

440
00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.686
Why is your hair wet?

441
00:36:53.688 --> 00:36:55.355
Did you know there's a
creek behind the house?


442
00:36:55.357 --> 00:36:57.326
- What?
- It's wild.


443
00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:10.538
If this is what
the world is like,


444
00:37:12.207 --> 00:37:14.043
then we're all that we have.

445
00:37:16.412 --> 00:37:18.513
I know, I know.

446
00:37:49.577 --> 00:37:50.810
Now what do we do?

447
00:37:57.585 --> 00:37:59.752
Whatever the fuck we want.

448
00:39:13.128 --> 00:39:14.693
Tell me a story.

449
00:39:14.695 --> 00:39:16.465
About what?

450
00:39:17.299 --> 00:39:19.698
Anything.

451
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:20.536
Okay.

452
00:39:23.305 --> 00:39:25.207
Mm, got it.

453
00:39:26.841 --> 00:39:28.707
This is an old one, so
stop me if you've heard it.


454
00:39:28.709 --> 00:39:29.545
'Kay.

455
00:39:33.315 --> 00:39:35.415
It was a particularly
uneventful night,


456
00:39:35.417 --> 00:39:36.982
in the dead of winter.

457
00:39:36.984 --> 00:39:39.219
A man was traveling
along a mountain path,


458
00:39:39.221 --> 00:39:41.388
when the breeze
boasted to the hot sun,


459
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:44.224
that it was truly the
stronger of the two.


460
00:39:44.226 --> 00:39:47.227
I can topple
trees, bury ships in the sea,


461
00:39:47.229 --> 00:39:50.363
and raise tidal waves larger
than the tallest mountains,


462
00:39:50.365 --> 00:39:53.999
that can devastate even
the mightiest of cities.


463
00:39:54.001 --> 00:39:55.835
The sun laughed.

464
00:39:55.837 --> 00:39:57.270
And of course, we
all know that the sun


465
00:39:57.272 --> 00:39:59.573
is the most powerful
thing in the solar system.


466
00:39:59.575 --> 00:40:00.409
Right.

467
00:40:01.376 --> 00:40:03.412
You dare tempt me, Wind?

468
00:40:04.346 --> 00:40:07.380
See that weary man, far below?

469
00:40:07.382 --> 00:40:10.883
Let us see who can take
the coat off that man.


470
00:40:10.885 --> 00:40:14.521
If you can, you are
truly the greatest.


471
00:40:14.523 --> 00:40:16.456
That is simple.

472
00:40:16.458 --> 00:40:19.126
The breeze
swelled, and blew hard.


473
00:40:19.128 --> 00:40:22.061
The man clung hard to his
coat, and no matter how strong


474
00:40:22.063 --> 00:40:24.264
the wind blew, he
never relented.


475
00:40:24.266 --> 00:40:26.932
He only shivered,
pulled his coat tighter.


476
00:40:26.934 --> 00:40:29.869
The sun stepped out from
behind a cloud, and grew.


477
00:40:29.871 --> 00:40:32.938
Its heat warmed the air,
and the frosty ground.


478
00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:34.407
The snow melted.

479
00:40:34.409 --> 00:40:37.544
The leaves of the trees
shriveled, and turned to dust.


480
00:40:37.546 --> 00:40:41.615
The man grew hot, and sought
refuge in the shade of a hill.


481
00:40:41.617 --> 00:40:44.584
He took off his
coat, and rested.


482
00:40:44.586 --> 00:40:46.488
The breeze was dumbfounded.

483
00:40:47.489 --> 00:40:50.590
How did you do that?

484
00:40:50.592 --> 00:40:53.895
Not with force,
but with gentleness.


485
00:40:58.933 --> 00:41:00.433
Then what?

486
00:41:00.435 --> 00:41:04.306
Well, that's kinda the
end of the story, I guess.


487
00:41:05.773 --> 00:41:07.008
But what about the man?

488
00:41:08.809 --> 00:41:10.678
He dies, eventually.

489
00:41:11.779 --> 00:41:12.780
Shit.

490
00:41:21.856 --> 00:41:23.423
I'd be doing a show,

491
00:41:23.425 --> 00:41:26.295
and I would remember everything
about the performance,


492
00:41:27.262 --> 00:41:28.961
leading up to it.

493
00:41:28.963 --> 00:41:30.930
And then I would
sort of, come to,


494
00:41:30.932 --> 00:41:33.032
as the audience was clapping.

495
00:41:33.034 --> 00:41:37.102
Like there was a void in my
memory of the entire show.


496
00:41:37.104 --> 00:41:38.704
Kinda like when
you're driving,


497
00:41:38.706 --> 00:41:40.273
and you get to your destination,

498
00:41:40.275 --> 00:41:41.641
but you don't
remember the drive?


499
00:41:41.643 --> 00:41:43.010
Yeah, like that.

500
00:41:44.646 --> 00:41:46.648
There's a sorta high, I guess.

501
00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:50.818
That's what I liked.

502
00:41:52.354 --> 00:41:54.321
You could perform for me.

503
00:41:54.323 --> 00:41:55.156
A private show?

504
00:41:56.625 --> 00:41:58.558
The whole
world's our private show.


505
00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.361
Huh.

506
00:42:03.332 --> 00:42:05.632
I should've picked a
more manly profession.


507
00:42:05.634 --> 00:42:07.800
Like a hunter.

508
00:42:07.802 --> 00:42:09.238
Or a lumberjack.

509
00:42:27.922 --> 00:42:31.090
Have you ever climbed a tree?

510
00:42:31.092 --> 00:42:33.058
You don't think I can?

511
00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.430
- Mm.
- Watch this.


512
00:42:38.065 --> 00:42:41.536
Yeah,
what's your first step?


513
00:42:46.173 --> 00:42:49.276
It's a gesture.

514
00:42:49.278 --> 00:42:52.947
You invite the viewer
to move about the piece.


515
00:42:55.617 --> 00:42:57.218
They become an explorer.

516
00:42:58.587 --> 00:43:01.688
Dipping in and out of
thought, through the nooks


517
00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:06.695
and the crannies, shifting in
and out of light, and color.


518
00:43:11.733 --> 00:43:13.866
It's not meant to be one thing,

519
00:43:13.868 --> 00:43:17.706
but a complex collection
of a variety of thoughts.


520
00:43:18.939 --> 00:43:23.412
Like a troubled, noisy
mind, frozen in a moment.


521
00:43:25.714 --> 00:43:28.317
The individual pieces
alone, are unique.


522
00:43:29.718 --> 00:43:34.088
And taken in as a whole can
seem messy, but take a step back


523
00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:38.560
and the whole of the thing
comes together as one.


524
00:43:51.473 --> 00:43:54.808
Wait, I think
I know where we are.


525
00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:56.443
Oh yeah?

526
00:43:56.445 --> 00:43:58.310
I know
this smell anywhere.


527
00:43:58.312 --> 00:44:00.482
Okay, open 'em.

528
00:44:02.316 --> 00:44:04.950
Oh yeah, it definitely
smells like mildew


529
00:44:04.952 --> 00:44:05.986
and urine in here.

530
00:44:06.954 --> 00:44:07.823
Wait for it.

531
00:44:13.961 --> 00:44:16.431
Your co-star.

532
00:44:17.833 --> 00:44:22.838
Okay, what
do you wanna see?


533
00:44:23.372 --> 00:44:24.637
Anything.

534
00:44:24.639 --> 00:44:26.974
Maybe something you
remember from before.


535
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:32.947
All right, um, oh, I got it.

536
00:44:34.882 --> 00:44:36.884
The scene takes place
outside of a cafe.


537
00:44:37.819 --> 00:44:39.452
I was waiting.

538
00:44:39.454 --> 00:44:41.688
I was waiting on you, actually.

539
00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:44.123
And this stranger came up to me.

540
00:44:44.125 --> 00:44:47.962
She said, uh, well she said

541
00:44:49.498 --> 00:44:50.730
"Excuse me,

542
00:44:50.732 --> 00:44:53.298
"do you know what
time brunch ends?"


543
00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:56.335
And I was like, I don't know.

544
00:44:56.337 --> 00:44:59.006
And she said "You don't know?"

545
00:45:00.975 --> 00:45:02.074
No.

546
00:45:02.076 --> 00:45:03.710
"How can you work at a
place that serves brunch


547
00:45:03.712 --> 00:45:05.077
"and not even know
what time it ends?


548
00:45:05.079 --> 00:45:07.146
"Isn't that like your
one fucking job?"


549
00:45:07.148 --> 00:45:08.080
I don't work here.

550
00:45:08.082 --> 00:45:10.082
"You look like you work here."

551
00:45:10.084 --> 00:45:11.350
What?

552
00:45:11.352 --> 00:45:12.585
"You're wearing
that black shirt,


553
00:45:12.587 --> 00:45:14.221
"and you're standing
by the door, so..."


554
00:45:16.357 --> 00:45:19.594
If I worked here, wouldn't
I be inside, working?


555
00:45:20.829 --> 00:45:22.261
"Look man, I don't know you,

556
00:45:22.263 --> 00:45:24.329
"you could be on your
break or something."


557
00:45:24.331 --> 00:45:25.532
I'm just waiting for someone.

558
00:45:25.534 --> 00:45:28.435
"Oh my God, would you calm down?

559
00:45:28.437 --> 00:45:30.503
"It's just a simple
fucking question."


560
00:45:30.505 --> 00:45:32.070
To somebody that
doesn't know the answer.


561
00:45:32.072 --> 00:45:35.042
"Jesus, Yelp was right,
this place is horrible.


562
00:45:36.778 --> 00:45:38.277
"And you know what, just go back

563
00:45:38.279 --> 00:45:41.213
"to whatever shithole you came
from, you fuckin' tourist."


564
00:45:41.215 --> 00:45:42.549
But I was born here.

565
00:45:42.551 --> 00:45:44.584
I'm from here.

566
00:45:44.586 --> 00:45:46.719
Maybe the hipster
girl's right.


567
00:45:46.721 --> 00:45:50.055
Maybe we should
go somewhere else.


568
00:45:50.057 --> 00:45:50.892
Get away.

569
00:45:53.528 --> 00:45:54.361
Maybe.

570
00:46:25.459 --> 00:46:27.261
Hey, have you
seen my blue velvet?


571
00:46:28.597 --> 00:46:29.430
Bar?

572
00:46:30.565 --> 00:46:32.097
What?

573
00:46:32.099 --> 00:46:34.101
My blue
velvet, have you seen it?


574
00:46:35.135 --> 00:46:36.270
No, uh, I don't know.

575
00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:02.962
All right, let's
get out of here.


576
00:47:02.964 --> 00:47:03.963
You wanna take this?

577
00:47:03.965 --> 00:47:06.465
No, nah, go ahead and grab it.

578
00:47:06.467 --> 00:47:07.434
I'll paint over it.

579
00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.184
What if there's
somebody out there,


580
00:47:26.186 --> 00:47:28.355
and we don't even know it?

581
00:47:30.725 --> 00:47:32.159
Where would they be?

582
00:47:34.228 --> 00:47:35.296
I don't know.

583
00:47:36.363 --> 00:47:37.699
Where would
we even start looking?


584
00:47:41.335 --> 00:47:42.571
I don't know.

585
00:47:48.242 --> 00:47:49.176
Racist people.

586
00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:52.814
Children.

587
00:47:54.849 --> 00:47:55.850
Stockbrokers.

588
00:47:57.418 --> 00:47:59.351
Bill Gates.

589
00:47:59.353 --> 00:48:00.521
And Mel Gibson.

590
00:48:05.359 --> 00:48:07.161
All of North Korea.

591
00:48:11.198 --> 00:48:13.935
Every artist
you've ever known.


592
00:48:20.374 --> 00:48:24.946
And every actor,
and every director,


593
00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:27.379
and every scientist,

594
00:48:27.381 --> 00:48:29.718
and politician,
and schoolteacher.


595
00:48:35.189 --> 00:48:37.391
All the shitty ones,
and all the good ones.


596
00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.818
Man, being an astronomer's kind
of a bullshit job, isn't it?


597
00:50:12.653 --> 00:50:15.522
Like, all they do
is look at stuff,


598
00:50:16.991 --> 00:50:18.893
and then write
down what they saw.


599
00:50:20.795 --> 00:50:25.632
Like, oh look, that star
just exploded, write it down.


600
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:33.507
I mean, sometimes,
that's all you have to do.


601
00:50:35.676 --> 00:50:39.748
You observe, and then interpret.

602
00:51:20.188 --> 00:51:22.223
Well, I guess that
was inevitable.


603
00:52:15.442 --> 00:52:16.277
Phyl?

604
00:52:18.012 --> 00:52:18.913
Come inside.

605
00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:24.785
Okay.

606
00:52:25.619 --> 00:52:26.818
What are we doin' in a tent?

607
00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:29.588
Actually, it's an
ancient Inuit structure,


608
00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:32.657
designed to keep us warm and
safe from the outside elements


609
00:52:32.659 --> 00:52:34.359
of the arctic tundra.

610
00:52:34.361 --> 00:52:38.097
I know, it's made of ice, so
you'd think it'd be freezing,


611
00:52:38.099 --> 00:52:40.134
but actually it
keeps the warmth in.


612
00:52:41.035 --> 00:52:42.134
I feel it.

613
00:52:42.136 --> 00:52:43.004
Oh, wait for it.

614
00:52:44.939 --> 00:52:46.707
I found this little guy outside.

615
00:52:48.842 --> 00:52:50.508
How d'you think he got here?

616
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:54.813
Oh, probably just went
for a walk, got lost,


617
00:52:54.815 --> 00:52:57.049
wandered around for a bit,
and next thing he knew,


618
00:52:57.051 --> 00:52:57.986
he was in the cold.

619
00:52:58.987 --> 00:52:59.820
Poor little guy.

620
00:53:36.357 --> 00:53:37.522
What
are we doing here?


621
00:53:37.524 --> 00:53:39.758
Escaping
the elements.


622
00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:41.760
We can't
stay in here forever.


623
00:53:41.762 --> 00:53:43.062
Why not?

624
00:53:43.064 --> 00:53:43.897
We just can't.

625
00:53:45.866 --> 00:53:46.700
We'll die.

626
00:53:48.002 --> 00:53:49.170
I gotta get outta here.

627
00:54:02.716 --> 00:54:04.118
Please don't die before me.

628
00:54:06.054 --> 00:54:07.121
We could die together.

629
00:54:10.857 --> 00:54:12.260
Wanna make a suicide pact?

630
00:54:16.563 --> 00:54:20.401
If you died, I would
die of a broken heart.


631
00:54:22.103 --> 00:54:25.104
We'd be like, wrapped
in each others' arms,


632
00:54:25.106 --> 00:54:26.473
like the statues at Pompeii.

633
00:54:27.741 --> 00:54:29.108
I don't think there
were any like that.


634
00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:30.278
Of course there were.

635
00:54:32.913 --> 00:54:35.114
They did find a
guy masturbating.


636
00:54:37.918 --> 00:54:39.218
It happened.

637
00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:41.320
Okay, but you don't
have to talk about it


638
00:54:41.322 --> 00:54:42.723
when we're having a moment.

639
00:54:43.657 --> 00:54:46.459
Well what do you want from me?

640
00:54:46.461 --> 00:54:48.294
What's your problem?

641
00:54:48.296 --> 00:54:49.627
Nothing.

642
00:54:49.629 --> 00:54:50.795
I'm just not
excited about death.


643
00:54:50.797 --> 00:54:52.433
I didn't say that you were.

644
00:54:54.835 --> 00:54:56.004
Just fantasizing.

645
00:54:57.138 --> 00:54:59.071
Well death isn't
somethin' to joke about.


646
00:54:59.073 --> 00:55:00.074
I'm not joking.

647
00:55:01.175 --> 00:55:02.642
When did you get so morbid?

648
00:55:04.112 --> 00:55:05.512
I'm not morbid.

649
00:55:12.487 --> 00:55:15.189
It's like you don't even
wonder what this is all about.


650
00:55:16.523 --> 00:55:21.429
You sit around and turn
this over and over and over,


651
00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:25.297
trying to figure it out.

652
00:55:25.299 --> 00:55:29.834
But the truth is, that
we're never gonna know.


653
00:55:29.836 --> 00:55:33.707
So just snap out of it.

654
00:55:37.611 --> 00:55:39.080
I'm not like you, Phyl.

655
00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:43.817
I can't just turn on a dime.

656
00:55:47.488 --> 00:55:51.658
I can't help but feel the
burden that I was left behind.


657
00:55:55.695 --> 00:55:57.231
Those thoughts are insidious.

658
00:56:14.681 --> 00:56:16.917
I'm surrounded by so much stuff.

659
00:56:18.519 --> 00:56:20.752
But for some reason, it feels
like I'm standing in a room


660
00:56:20.754 --> 00:56:24.158
full of nothing, all the time.

661
00:56:28.061 --> 00:56:29.197
I'm there, too.

662
00:56:34.335 --> 00:56:38.206
Hey, hey!

663
00:56:40.441 --> 00:56:42.176
All I ever wanted
was to be happy.


664
00:56:44.611 --> 00:56:47.413
I thought that's
what you wanted, too.


665
00:56:47.415 --> 00:56:49.415
- I do, but...
- No buts.


666
00:56:49.417 --> 00:56:50.882
- Yeah, but...
- Barry!


667
00:56:50.884 --> 00:56:53.552
It's like you don't remember
what a shithole it was.


668
00:56:53.554 --> 00:56:54.453
I remember.

669
00:56:54.455 --> 00:56:56.087
Well, do you wanna go back

670
00:56:56.089 --> 00:56:57.757
to all that shit
that we endured?


671
00:56:58.925 --> 00:57:02.028
Back to that place
that didn't want us?


672
00:57:05.866 --> 00:57:07.399
Fuck it all.

673
00:57:07.401 --> 00:57:08.469
That's why we're here.

674
00:57:11.539 --> 00:57:16.544
Fuck the electricity, and
the cars, and buildings.


675
00:57:18.712 --> 00:57:19.913
We don't need any of it.

676
00:57:22.216 --> 00:57:23.382
We don't need the critics,

677
00:57:23.384 --> 00:57:25.253
and we don't need
the shitty directors.


678
00:57:27.754 --> 00:57:28.589
Fuck it all.

679
00:57:31.592 --> 00:57:32.759
Fuck it all.

680
00:57:34.562 --> 00:57:35.396
Come on.

681
00:57:57.585 --> 00:57:59.119
Did we go the wrong way?

682
00:58:02.822 --> 00:58:03.790
I don't think so.

683
00:58:06.661 --> 00:58:09.696
But, shouldn't we be
closer to the house by now?


684
00:58:20.807 --> 00:58:23.975
I guess, I guess
let's just keep goin'.


685
00:58:54.074 --> 00:58:55.976
Maybe we
took a wrong turn.


686
00:59:00.381 --> 00:59:01.382
Should we go back?

687
00:59:03.216 --> 00:59:05.319
I don't honestly
know which way is back.


688
00:59:10.924 --> 00:59:15.929
The highway runs north to
south, so if we go east or west,


689
00:59:17.163 --> 00:59:18.499
we'll run into it
eventually, right?


690
00:59:20.033 --> 00:59:21.669
Yeah,
that makes sense.


691
00:59:23.504 --> 00:59:26.237
Fuck, I shoulda
been in the scouts.


692
00:59:34.114 --> 00:59:35.681
All right, which
way is east or west?


693
00:59:35.683 --> 00:59:37.215
This way.

694
00:59:37.217 --> 00:59:38.018
Or this way.

695
00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:40.519
Let's go this way.

696
00:59:40.521 --> 00:59:42.623
Scouts, my ass.

697
01:00:00.308 --> 01:00:01.609
Holy shit.

698
01:00:04.412 --> 01:00:05.413
What should we do?

699
01:00:15.623 --> 01:00:16.457
Look.

700
01:00:21.995 --> 01:00:23.995
Lets get some rest.

701
01:00:23.997 --> 01:00:27.298
In the morning, I'll go up
to that ridge, right there.


702
01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:30.671
When the sun's out, I'll
see if I can see, something.


703
01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:34.775
Okay.

704
01:00:37.745 --> 01:00:38.612
Oh, oh God.

705
01:00:50.924 --> 01:00:52.760
I'd say something
reassuring, like,


706
01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.830
I'm sure somebody's
looking for us.


707
01:00:59.199 --> 01:01:00.200
I know it's not true.

708
01:01:14.615 --> 01:01:17.350
We've got the
moon on our side.


709
01:01:23.457 --> 01:01:25.559
We got that goin' for us.

710
01:01:37.971 --> 01:01:39.973
Startin' to feel
like a punishment.


711
01:02:46.206 --> 01:02:47.040
Fuck.

712
01:03:09.996 --> 01:03:11.599
Startin' to think it's all gone.

713
01:03:21.007 --> 01:03:25.144
I don't, I don't
wanna be here anymore.


714
01:03:37.691 --> 01:03:39.092
And I want ice cream.

715
01:03:47.601 --> 01:03:48.499
I'm sorry.

716
01:03:48.501 --> 01:03:50.336
Don't apologize.

717
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:02.616
Just let me think.

718
01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.295
Okay.

719
01:04:18.364 --> 01:04:20.866
Do you
remember when we first met?


720
01:04:20.868 --> 01:04:22.233
At the bookstore?

721
01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:36.080
That, wasn't me.

722
01:04:36.082 --> 01:04:37.183
Oh.

723
01:04:46.225 --> 01:04:47.558
Ah, 'scuse me?

724
01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.394
What?

725
01:04:49.763 --> 01:04:51.364
Um, I'm looking for David.

726
01:04:57.370 --> 01:04:59.071
I'm the new set designer.

727
01:04:59.073 --> 01:05:01.740
Oh, okay.

728
01:05:01.742 --> 01:05:02.741
God, right.

729
01:05:08.581 --> 01:05:09.415
I'm an idiot.

730
01:05:19.927 --> 01:05:20.961
My idiot.

731
01:05:36.043 --> 01:05:39.612
- I miss that.
- Me too.


732
01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.755
I liked when you'd
watch me work.


733
01:05:57.563 --> 01:05:59.298
I don't like what we've become.

734
01:06:37.838 --> 01:06:39.472
Phyl, Phyl, Phyl!

735
01:06:43.877 --> 01:06:45.478
We never asked for it back.

736
01:06:52.452 --> 01:06:54.620
We never just asked for it back.

737
01:06:55.823 --> 01:06:56.656
No.

738
01:06:57.690 --> 01:06:59.659
We just need it reversed.

739
01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:06.330
What?

740
01:07:06.332 --> 01:07:08.668
We need to ask the
universe to reverse it.


741
01:07:09.669 --> 01:07:11.004
Back the way it was.

742
01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.056
I don't even
remember what I said.


743
01:07:33.026 --> 01:07:36.362
We asked the cosmic
universe for privacy.


744
01:07:38.731 --> 01:07:40.067
So un-ask for it.

745
01:07:45.005 --> 01:07:50.010
Oh, cosmic universe, um,

746
01:07:52.278 --> 01:07:54.848
undo what has been done,

747
01:07:57.517 --> 01:08:02.421
and return the people
of Earth to Earth.


748
01:08:08.061 --> 01:08:11.629
I'm sorry for what I asked for,

749
01:08:11.631 --> 01:08:15.035
and, and, um, and
I didn't mean it.


750
01:08:25.145 --> 01:08:26.779
I think we just
wait til morning.


751
01:09:09.089 --> 01:09:10.588
What are you doing?

752
01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:12.458
I'm building a house.

753
01:09:15.361 --> 01:09:16.995
Why?

754
01:09:16.997 --> 01:09:18.631
I liked our house.

755
01:09:19.665 --> 01:09:21.166
We need to rebuild again.

756
01:09:21.168 --> 01:09:25.005
I'm sick and tired of
wandering around the woods.


757
01:09:26.874 --> 01:09:28.041
We should keep going.

758
01:09:28.942 --> 01:09:30.208
And go where?

759
01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:32.643
East, like you said.

760
01:09:32.645 --> 01:09:33.777
And do what?

761
01:09:33.779 --> 01:09:37.282
We might, find something.

762
01:09:37.284 --> 01:09:39.050
I know exactly what
we're gonna find.


763
01:09:39.052 --> 01:09:41.119
Over there, is more trees.

764
01:09:41.121 --> 01:09:43.420
And guess what, over
there, more trees.


765
01:09:43.422 --> 01:09:44.555
Will you stop
acting like that?


766
01:09:44.557 --> 01:09:46.358
How am I supposed to act

767
01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:49.829
when I'm lost in
the fucking woods?


768
01:09:51.231 --> 01:09:55.133
I'm annoyed, and I'm tired
of being surrounded by trees.


769
01:09:55.135 --> 01:09:57.135
You're yelling at a tree.

770
01:09:57.137 --> 01:09:58.871
I don't like trees.

771
01:09:59.739 --> 01:10:01.206
You want the trees to be gone?

772
01:10:01.208 --> 01:10:02.706
Yes.

773
01:10:02.708 --> 01:10:05.476
Okay, well kicking them
isn't gonna get rid of them.


774
01:10:05.478 --> 01:10:07.247
You're kicking a tree.

775
01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.254
We should just keep moving.

776
01:10:16.856 --> 01:10:18.325
We can go anywhere we want.

777
01:10:20.693 --> 01:10:25.698
You wanna go to the ocean, watch
the sun rise over the Gulf?


778
01:10:26.366 --> 01:10:27.165
Let's go!

779
01:10:27.167 --> 01:10:28.601
We can go anywhere.

780
01:10:31.570 --> 01:10:35.574
But we're not gonna get there
with you acting like a baby.


781
01:10:37.576 --> 01:10:39.110
I don't like being lost.

782
01:10:39.112 --> 01:10:42.015
Well then, let's
get out of the woods!


783
01:10:56.063 --> 01:11:00.566
If I leave, I'm not sure
I'll find my way back to you.


784
01:11:04.537 --> 01:11:06.371
There's a better chance
of us finding something


785
01:11:06.373 --> 01:11:07.873
if we're looking together.

786
01:11:08.976 --> 01:11:09.809
No.

787
01:11:11.278 --> 01:11:14.047
Every time we go anywhere, the
world as we know it changes.


788
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:18.385
We should just be happy
with what we've got.


789
01:11:21.288 --> 01:11:22.289
I'm staying right here.

790
01:11:26.994 --> 01:11:28.228
Is that what you want?

791
01:11:30.763 --> 01:11:31.964
I wanna build a house.

792
01:11:34.434 --> 01:11:35.935
A place for us to be us again.

793
01:11:48.415 --> 01:11:50.017
We don't need
a house for that.


794
01:13:19.905 --> 01:13:23.276
You've got to be
fucking kidding me!


795
01:13:30.450 --> 01:13:31.284
What the?

796
01:13:34.521 --> 01:13:36.389
Nice, isn't it?

797
01:13:39.126 --> 01:13:43.196
You said you hated the trees,
wanted to be in the sand.


798
01:13:44.096 --> 01:13:44.930
Yeah.

799
01:13:46.065 --> 01:13:50.769
In the, Hawaii, or
Greece, or something.


800
01:13:54.039 --> 01:13:56.942
Not in the middle of
the fucking desert!


801
01:14:10.890 --> 01:14:12.559
You coulda done anything to us.

802
01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.061
You coulda turned me
into a little cockroach.


803
01:14:18.063 --> 01:14:21.667
Or one of those little rats
that just shits everywhere.


804
01:14:24.069 --> 01:14:26.306
You coulda done anything!

805
01:14:28.741 --> 01:14:29.643
And you do this?

806
01:14:32.245 --> 01:14:36.614
You put us in a place that's
incapable of sustaining life?


807
01:14:36.616 --> 01:14:39.116
Barry, who are you talking to?

808
01:14:39.118 --> 01:14:42.121
Whatever god is up there.

809
01:14:43.756 --> 01:14:44.757
Toying with us.

810
01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:48.295
You know?

811
01:14:49.596 --> 01:14:53.464
Just playin' with us, like
we're in a little ant farm.


812
01:14:53.466 --> 01:14:54.865
He's got a magnifying glass,

813
01:14:54.867 --> 01:14:57.036
he's burnin' away
everything we love.


814
01:15:02.642 --> 01:15:03.610
But guess what.

815
01:15:05.645 --> 01:15:06.479
Guess.

816
01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.845
I don't even, honestly
know what it is...


817
01:15:08.847 --> 01:15:12.650
I can kick whatever
I want to kick!


818
01:15:22.728 --> 01:15:23.628
What?

819
01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:24.464
You're laughing.

820
01:15:27.567 --> 01:15:28.401
Yeah.

821
01:15:32.239 --> 01:15:35.808
I can't remember the
last time that you laughed.


822
01:15:37.677 --> 01:15:42.249
Huh, well, I
think I finally get it.


823
01:15:47.387 --> 01:15:48.555
What do you get?

824
01:15:50.690 --> 01:15:51.591
All this.

825
01:16:01.033 --> 01:16:03.403
No matter how far we
get from the world,


826
01:16:08.441 --> 01:16:10.943
it's always gonna be a
pretty shitty place for us.


827
01:16:15.615 --> 01:16:18.050
There's always gonna
be some greater power,


828
01:16:20.252 --> 01:16:22.121
that's pushin' down
on our happiness.


829
01:16:24.557 --> 01:16:29.562
Some Zeus, bringin' in a
flood, takin' everything away.


830
01:16:34.734 --> 01:16:35.735
'Til we got nothin'.

831
01:16:43.942 --> 01:16:48.947
Nothin' except someone
who understands all of that.


832
01:16:57.324 --> 01:16:58.157
Yeah.

833
01:17:06.965 --> 01:17:08.335
Wanna build a sand castle?

834
01:17:17.009 --> 01:17:17.910
This is nice.

835
01:17:18.977 --> 01:17:19.978
Isn't it, though?

836
01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:23.248
The waves, the breeze.

837
01:17:25.284 --> 01:17:27.319
The sun, sand.

838
01:17:29.321 --> 01:17:31.154
You know what, screw the sun.

839
01:17:31.156 --> 01:17:32.457
We don't need it.

840
01:17:32.459 --> 01:17:33.957
Screw the stars, screw the moon,

841
01:17:33.959 --> 01:17:35.760
screw everything
in the universe.


842
01:17:35.762 --> 01:17:37.762
You really wanna try
your luck with that one?


843
01:17:37.764 --> 01:17:39.466
Oh, I made you something.

844
01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:42.000
- For me?
- Yeah!


845
01:18:09.895 --> 01:18:11.498
And you got your vacation.

846
01:18:19.171 --> 01:18:20.407
And I got us here.

847
01:18:23.075 --> 01:18:24.009
What did you say?

848
01:18:26.311 --> 01:18:30.249
You got your
vacation, and I got you.


849
01:18:31.651 --> 01:18:34.351
What?

850
01:18:34.353 --> 01:18:36.989
You said you wanted to be
away from all the people,


851
01:18:38.023 --> 01:18:39.759
now we're away from
all the people.


852
01:18:47.399 --> 01:18:48.233
Right.

853
01:18:51.738 --> 01:18:53.038
I wanted a vacation.

854
01:18:59.512 --> 01:19:01.848
Rid the planet
of all the people.


855
01:19:09.889 --> 01:19:12.055
Let's get out of the woods.

856
01:19:12.057 --> 01:19:13.860
We don't need
a house for that.


857
01:19:20.065 --> 01:19:21.097
You wanna go back to all that?

858
01:19:21.099 --> 01:19:22.934
To that shit that we endured?

859
01:19:22.936 --> 01:19:26.203
We don't need any of it,
that's why we're here.


860
01:19:26.205 --> 01:19:29.642
Fuck the electricity, fuck
the buildings, fuck it all.


861
01:19:47.961 --> 01:19:48.795
It's you.

862
01:19:51.965 --> 01:19:53.498
What?

863
01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:55.100
It's been you this whole time.

864
01:19:59.304 --> 01:20:01.106
What are you talking about?

865
01:20:02.307 --> 01:20:04.243
Whatever you've
wanted, you've gotten.


866
01:20:06.746 --> 01:20:08.746
That's ridiculous.

867
01:20:08.748 --> 01:20:12.984
No, no, there's no
greater force at work here.


868
01:20:12.986 --> 01:20:14.453
It's just you!

869
01:20:17.122 --> 01:20:19.491
I don't understand
what's happening right now.


870
01:20:21.861 --> 01:20:23.997
You did this.

871
01:20:25.999 --> 01:20:26.833
Did what?

872
01:20:28.535 --> 01:20:30.133
All of this!

873
01:20:30.135 --> 01:20:33.004
Everything you want, you get.

874
01:20:33.006 --> 01:20:34.104
No, that's not true.

875
01:20:34.106 --> 01:20:35.338
- Yes it is.
- Barry.


876
01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:36.774
Yes it is!

877
01:20:36.776 --> 01:20:40.445
There's no greater force pushing
down on me, it's just you!


878
01:20:42.047 --> 01:20:44.882
All I've ever
done is support you!


879
01:20:44.884 --> 01:20:45.950
- No!
- Yeah.


880
01:20:45.952 --> 01:20:47.150
- No.
- Yes I have!


881
01:20:47.152 --> 01:20:48.053
You're selfish!

882
01:20:49.822 --> 01:20:50.890
You're selfish.

883
01:20:57.162 --> 01:20:58.665
What's gotten into you?

884
01:21:01.066 --> 01:21:04.169
You say that you just
want to be with me.


885
01:21:05.972 --> 01:21:07.972
You just wanna
make yourself happy.


886
01:21:07.974 --> 01:21:10.007
You don't care
about anything else.


887
01:21:10.009 --> 01:21:10.875
No, that's not

888
01:21:10.877 --> 01:21:12.009
- true at all.
- Yes it is.


889
01:21:12.011 --> 01:21:13.578
- Why would you think that?
- Yes it is.


890
01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:14.544
You wanted this.

891
01:21:14.546 --> 01:21:15.880
You wanted this.

892
01:21:15.882 --> 01:21:18.248
All I ever wanted
was to be with you.


893
01:21:18.250 --> 01:21:19.884
- That's not true!
- Yes it is, Barry stop.


894
01:21:19.886 --> 01:21:21.986
- Don't come near me!
- Barry, stop, please.


895
01:21:21.988 --> 01:21:23.353
I don't wanna see you again!

896
01:21:23.355 --> 01:21:25.858
Please, could you just stop?

897
01:21:37.269 --> 01:21:39.235
No, no no no no.

898
01:21:39.237 --> 01:21:40.907
Barry, no no, Barry?

899
01:21:42.775 --> 01:21:45.377
Barry, Barry Barry Barry Barry.

900
01:21:46.946 --> 01:21:48.613
Oh my God, oh my God!

901
01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:52.517
I don't want this.

902
01:21:53.753 --> 01:21:55.953
I don't want this, I
don't want anything


903
01:21:55.955 --> 01:21:57.090
if I don't have you.

904
01:22:00.559 --> 01:22:01.892
No.

905
01:22:16.809 --> 01:22:17.644
Barry?

906
01:22:21.047 --> 01:22:21.981
Where are you?

907
01:22:23.415 --> 01:22:24.982
I can't see you.

908
01:22:24.984 --> 01:22:25.885
Barry!

909
01:22:29.554 --> 01:22:30.657
Please come back to me!

910
01:22:35.293 --> 01:22:36.129
Please!
