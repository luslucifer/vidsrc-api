00:01:16.213 --> 00:01:19.671
WELCOME TO LAS TUCAS

2
00:01:19.755 --> 00:01:22.671
A MAGICAL PLACE

3
00:01:31.796 --> 00:01:32.921
Rosita!

4
00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:36.088
- Hi, Norma.
- Hi. How's it going?


5
00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:45.421
Rosa!

6
00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:47.505
Rosita!

7
00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:53.755
Rosa?

8
00:01:57.505 --> 00:01:59.171
Didn't you hear me honking?

9
00:01:59.755 --> 00:02:01.338
I need to talk to you, ma'am.

10
00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:05.213
Sure, but help me unload first.
I left the car open.


11
00:02:05.296 --> 00:02:07.046
No. Let's talk now.

12
00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:11.921
Has something happened?

13
00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:14.005
I won't be working here anymore.

14
00:02:14.088 --> 00:02:16.046
- What?
- I quit.


15
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.463
I've been offered a live-in job.
It pays well.


16
00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:22.713
I can rent out my house
and earn a bit extra.


17
00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:24.755
I thought you felt
like one of the family.

18
00:02:25.338 --> 00:02:27.671
Yes. Who never got to eat with you
in the holidays.


19
00:02:27.755 --> 00:02:30.171
I'd always watch from the kitchen door.

20
00:02:30.255 --> 00:02:31.880
Well... Fine.

21
00:02:32.546 --> 00:02:34.713
If it's what's best for you,

22
00:02:35.463 --> 00:02:37.255
I'll pay you at
the end of the month.

23
00:02:37.338 --> 00:02:38.630
No, I'm leaving today.

24
00:02:39.296 --> 00:02:41.588
Giving notice would make it harder.

25
00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:44.546
Then I'll see you out.

26
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.130
Rosa.

27
00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:00.713
Your uniform.

28
00:03:06.463 --> 00:03:08.630
No, please don't. Just go.

29
00:03:30.421 --> 00:03:31.963
- Hello.
- Norma!


30
00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:34.380
- I'm here to see InÃ©s.
- She's in sonography.


31
00:03:35.046 --> 00:03:36.463
Sonography. Through there.

32
00:03:37.088 --> 00:03:38.963
No... Okay. Thanks, Ale.

33
00:03:39.046 --> 00:03:40.046
You're welcome.

34
00:03:48.546 --> 00:03:52.213
Breathe. Very good.

35
00:03:54.171 --> 00:03:56.546
You can raise your daughter on your own.

36
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.046
Don't worry if your family don't help out.

37
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.796
What are you doing, Mom? I'm working.

38
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.046
Yes, I'm sorry.
I need to speak to you urgently.


39
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.046
Wait outside. I'll be right out.

40
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.380
Close the door, Mom.
Thank you. Wait outside.


41
00:04:10.671 --> 00:04:11.671
Now...

42
00:04:11.755 --> 00:04:16.213
She said I could have let her eat with us,
but who would that benefit?


43
00:04:16.296 --> 00:04:19.796
I don't get it.
I don't understand why she left.


44
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.130
That's so ugly, honey.

45
00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:27.671
I mean it, stop smoking.
You're a doctor. Especially here.


46
00:04:27.755 --> 00:04:29.171
Everyone can see you.

47
00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:33.505
Is something wrong?

48
00:04:36.213 --> 00:04:38.171
I'll never smoke again.

49
00:04:38.255 --> 00:04:42.130
<i>They robbed a clothing store
in downtown Las Tucas</i>


50
00:04:42.213 --> 00:04:43.838
<i>with a welding gun.</i>

51
00:04:43.921 --> 00:04:48.588
<i>A welding gun, a worker's tool,
used for a robbery...</i>


52
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:49.880
What are you doing?

53
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.671
You made me jump.

54
00:04:52.255 --> 00:04:53.505
To cheer you up.

55
00:04:53.588 --> 00:04:55.338
<i>...around midday.</i>

56
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:56.630
Thanks. They're beautiful.

57
00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:58.505
<i>...two men and two women.</i>

58
00:04:58.588 --> 00:05:00.380
<i>What role did the women play?</i>

59
00:05:00.463 --> 00:05:03.046
<i>The women acted as a lookout.</i>

60
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.755
<i>What would feminists make of that?</i>

61
00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:08.088
<i>Tools should be for work!</i>

62
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:17.630
Norma! Do you have cash for the taxi?

63
00:05:17.713 --> 00:05:21.005
You made me jump, Mom.
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?


64
00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:23.671
I came to get the spare key
for my apartment.


65
00:05:23.755 --> 00:05:26.171
I gave one to
your sister. She lost it.

66
00:05:26.255 --> 00:05:28.880
Why give her a
spare if she never goes?

67
00:05:28.963 --> 00:05:31.046
Where's your cash?

68
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.005
In my purse, in the kitchen.

69
00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:38.171
Rosita! Rosita, honey,
would you fetch Norma's purse?


70
00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:41.921
Where's Rosa? I can't take this.

71
00:05:42.005 --> 00:05:43.671
Diagonally.

72
00:05:43.755 --> 00:05:47.171
Always diagonally. 
Otherwise they die.

73
00:05:47.255 --> 00:05:48.338
You don't know...

74
00:05:49.296 --> 00:05:52.546
- What an ungrateful piece of trash.
- Don't say that, Mom.


75
00:05:53.421 --> 00:05:55.130
They're all the same, Normita.

76
00:05:55.213 --> 00:05:57.505
They're all trash. 
Fucking whores.

77
00:05:58.171 --> 00:05:59.796
Just like the overnight nurse.

78
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.546
You don't want to believe it,
but she brought a man home.


79
00:06:04.046 --> 00:06:07.588
They were screwing in the kitchen
while I was asleep.


80
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:09.296
- Honestly!
- Mom...


81
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.963
You built up her confidence too much.

82
00:06:16.046 --> 00:06:17.296
Who? Roberto?

83
00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:20.671
No, Rosita.

84
00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:25.255
That boy looks just like the actor
from the telenovela I'm watching.


85
00:06:25.338 --> 00:06:26.213
Here.

86
00:06:26.296 --> 00:06:30.296
Tell Beba that next time she loses it,
she can get it copied herself.


87
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.713
What's wrong?

88
00:06:32.255 --> 00:06:34.171
I don't know.

89
00:06:35.463 --> 00:06:36.463
Thank you.

90
00:06:37.255 --> 00:06:38.755
I spoke to your sister.

91
00:06:39.463 --> 00:06:41.963
- She said to call her.
- Me call her?


92
00:06:42.463 --> 00:06:44.963
- She can call me.
- Norma, she's weaker.


93
00:06:45.046 --> 00:06:48.046
And I'm not weak? 
I'm very weak!

94
00:07:31.046 --> 00:07:32.046
Rosa?

95
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.630
Rosita, is that you?

96
00:08:04.463 --> 00:08:06.296
- Mom!
- Oh, honey.


97
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.796
You scared me.

98
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.088
- You scared <i>me.</i>
- No, you scared me.


99
00:08:10.171 --> 00:08:13.088
- What are you doing?
- I thought it was robbers.


100
00:08:13.171 --> 00:08:14.380
Robbers? Why?

101
00:08:14.921 --> 00:08:17.630
What do you mean, why? 
Don't you watch TV?

102
00:08:18.505 --> 00:08:19.796
Hi, sweetheart.

103
00:08:20.546 --> 00:08:22.755
Are you okay? I
came to check on you.

104
00:08:23.255 --> 00:08:25.463
And to drop off some laundry.

105
00:08:25.546 --> 00:08:26.755
- Sure.
- Are you okay?


106
00:08:26.838 --> 00:08:27.963
Yes.

107
00:08:28.463 --> 00:08:30.005
Give me a kiss.

108
00:08:30.963 --> 00:08:33.671
- Okay. I'll get on with...
- Okay.


109
00:08:33.755 --> 00:08:34.755
...the laundry.

110
00:08:35.296 --> 00:08:38.380
I've been so busy
all day since she left.

111
00:08:38.463 --> 00:08:41.421
Like I said, get
someone in to help you.

112
00:08:41.505 --> 00:08:42.880
Like I said.

113
00:08:42.963 --> 00:08:44.796
I'm not ready yet.

114
00:08:45.671 --> 00:08:47.671
- I need to be ready.
- Fine.


115
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:51.213
- Do you want coffee?
- No, I have to go.


116
00:08:51.296 --> 00:08:53.921
- What?
- I have to get to work.


117
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.921
The doctor's in demand, huh?

118
00:08:59.505 --> 00:09:00.838
Shall I call you later?

119
00:09:01.463 --> 00:09:02.630
- Yeah.
- Okay?


120
00:09:02.713 --> 00:09:04.046
Yes. Ciao.

Hi, honey.

133
00:10:34.046 --> 00:10:35.505
No, I haven't seen anything.

134
00:10:36.755 --> 00:10:38.005
Blue box?

135
00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:42.963
No. If I find it, 
I'll let you know.

136
00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:03.713
Try it without lifting the paintbrush.

137
00:11:05.713 --> 00:11:06.838
Let's see, Alina.

138
00:11:08.588 --> 00:11:09.588
Good.

139
00:11:18.088 --> 00:11:20.796
You clearly have a gift, Norma.

140
00:11:22.588 --> 00:11:25.588
Now, stay within the lines.

141
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.213
First learn the rules, then...

142
00:11:29.963 --> 00:11:31.338
to express yourself.

143
00:11:33.671 --> 00:11:37.880
Let me give you this month's money,
for me and for Alina.


144
00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:41.255
- Ah, yes. You're a sweetheart.
- Thank you, Norma.


145
00:11:44.755 --> 00:11:45.755
Mom?

146
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:50.713
<i>...he's obsessed with her,
and he won't let me fire her.</i>


147
00:11:50.796 --> 00:11:51.963
Mom?

148
00:11:52.046 --> 00:11:54.880
<i>Little by little,
I'll hatch a plan to find out...</i>


149
00:11:54.963 --> 00:11:55.963
No!

150
00:11:56.671 --> 00:11:58.546
Mom!

151
00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:00.671
Mom!

152
00:12:00.755 --> 00:12:01.755
Norma!

153
00:12:01.838 --> 00:12:02.671
What happened?

154
00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:04.213
- Nothing.
- What are you doing?


155
00:12:04.296 --> 00:12:07.755
I was styling my wig,
and I dropped my hearing aid.


156
00:12:07.838 --> 00:12:09.296
- Oh my God.
- Where is it?


157
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.880
- I thought you'd had a stroke.
- Such a pessimist. Like your father.


158
00:12:12.963 --> 00:12:14.505
- What's this?
- Give me a hand.


159
00:12:14.588 --> 00:12:17.046
- Are you looking for this?
- That's it.


160
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.171
It's so lucky we found it.

161
00:12:19.255 --> 00:12:21.380
- Grandma, it's me!
- I'm lost without it.


162
00:12:21.463 --> 00:12:23.713
- Come and help us!
- Coming.


163
00:12:23.796 --> 00:12:26.921
Help me! I'm stuck, Norma.
What do you think I'm doing?


164
00:12:27.005 --> 00:12:30.671
You can't have this plant
on top of the heater, Grandma.


165
00:12:30.755 --> 00:12:32.380
- It's dangerous.
- Oh, leave it.


166
00:12:32.463 --> 00:12:34.338
The heater's off.

167
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:37.380
Norma, you're a darling.
You got my groceries.


168
00:12:37.463 --> 00:12:39.463
- Did you get the spinach?
- Yes, Mom.


169
00:12:39.546 --> 00:12:40.588
- What's this?
- Look--


170
00:12:40.671 --> 00:12:43.671
- Ah, the lollipops.
- Go and sit down. Carefully.


171
00:12:43.755 --> 00:12:45.880
Careful. Look ahead when you're walking.

172
00:12:45.963 --> 00:12:47.088
- I am looking.
- Yes.


173
00:12:47.713 --> 00:12:50.213
- The plants are beautiful.
- You noticed them?


174
00:12:50.296 --> 00:12:52.338
- I've always had a green thumb.
- Amazing.


175
00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:56.005
It's a shame neither of my daughters
have that gift.


176
00:12:57.546 --> 00:13:01.296
Normita, make some tea
if you're not doing anything.


177
00:13:01.838 --> 00:13:02.963
- Go on.
- Yes, Mom.


178
00:13:03.046 --> 00:13:05.046
There's toast and jam...

179
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:06.546
- Look.
- We can have...


180
00:13:07.088 --> 00:13:10.671
Tell the overnight nurse
I don't want her smoking in here.


181
00:13:11.546 --> 00:13:13.755
It's the overnight nurse's man.

182
00:13:14.505 --> 00:13:16.546
Does this man wear lipstick?

183
00:13:40.838 --> 00:13:41.963
Insomnia?

184
00:13:54.296 --> 00:13:55.963
<i>Free cannabis.</i>

185
00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.963
- What are you watching?
- Hello.


186
00:14:00.921 --> 00:14:02.713
I was watching a documentary.

187
00:14:03.755 --> 00:14:04.921
About what?

188
00:14:05.671 --> 00:14:08.005
About... growing orchids.

189
00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.421
I'm thinking of building a greenhouse.

190
00:14:14.296 --> 00:14:16.546
- Here?
- No, at the cottage.


191
00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:19.755
The cottage is for sale.
Is something wrong?


192
00:14:21.046 --> 00:14:22.046
No.

193
00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:24.713
Nothing. You?

194
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.796
Nothing.

195
00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.880
Can I ask you a question?

196
00:14:57.963 --> 00:14:58.963
Of course.

197
00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:03.713
Do you think we're happy?

198
00:15:04.255 --> 00:15:05.338
Yes.

199
00:15:05.421 --> 00:15:06.421
Yes?

200
00:15:08.796 --> 00:15:10.171
But happy couples

201
00:15:11.213 --> 00:15:13.213
spend time together,

202
00:15:13.713 --> 00:15:16.838
like the same things, like to talk...

203
00:15:17.755 --> 00:15:19.255
We're together every day.

204
00:15:20.755 --> 00:15:23.505
We live in the same house.
We have the same friends.


205
00:15:27.088 --> 00:15:30.838
When I was young,
I thought I'd have grandchildren by now.


206
00:15:32.171 --> 00:15:35.796
Or I'd be living a bohemian lifestyle,
like an artist.


207
00:15:36.546 --> 00:15:38.130
Just like yours.

208
00:15:40.671 --> 00:15:44.296
I go to bed at ten every night,
and I can't sleep.


209
00:15:46.421 --> 00:15:47.671
Do you worry about InÃ©s?

210
00:15:50.296 --> 00:15:52.588
She's so career-focused. 
What can you do?

211
00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:55.671
She doesn't want kids.
She has no maternal instinct.


212
00:15:56.505 --> 00:15:59.088
She can't manage a relationship,
let alone a child.


213
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:03.921
She knows what she's doing.
She's successful. That's what matters.


214
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.546
Subject closed.

215
00:16:13.213 --> 00:16:15.713
Ours is a strange version of happiness.

216
00:17:49.171 --> 00:17:50.296
Hello?

217
00:17:51.463 --> 00:17:53.463
Yes. No. Hello.

218
00:17:54.088 --> 00:17:56.755
I'm at the cottage. 
I fell asleep.

219
00:17:58.588 --> 00:18:01.088
No. Yes... No.

220
00:18:01.171 --> 00:18:04.546
I only take them at night, to sleep.

221
00:18:05.046 --> 00:18:06.838
I just fell...

222
00:18:07.505 --> 00:18:08.796
Because I'm tired.

223
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.380
I'm doing everything in the house myself.

224
00:18:12.463 --> 00:18:17.088
Well, it's dirty,
but there's no sign of vandalism.


225
00:18:20.005 --> 00:18:21.255
I didn't forget.

226
00:18:21.338 --> 00:18:24.338
I'll drop by the house,
and then come there.


227
00:18:25.255 --> 00:18:27.505
Okay, fine. Okay.

228
00:18:29.171 --> 00:18:32.005
I'll come straight there in that case.

229
00:18:46.755 --> 00:18:47.755
Norma!

230
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.921
- Here.
- We're here, Mom. Over here.


231
00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.130
- Here.
- Come on.


232
00:18:56.213 --> 00:18:57.796
- Hello.
- How are you?


233
00:18:58.421 --> 00:19:00.088
So you went to the cottage?

234
00:19:00.171 --> 00:19:02.588
You should sell it before it falls apart.

235
00:19:02.671 --> 00:19:04.296
There's no internet or anything.

236
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.630
- It doesn't even have a TV.
- I like it.


237
00:19:07.213 --> 00:19:08.505
Did you see who's here?

238
00:19:08.588 --> 00:19:11.171
The psychologist I told you about,
from Buenos Aires.


239
00:19:11.255 --> 00:19:13.171
- Another G&T, please.
- She's fantastic.


240
00:19:13.255 --> 00:19:15.088
- Thanks.
- The redhead?


241
00:19:15.171 --> 00:19:17.838
I've referred patients
with anxiety to her.


242
00:19:17.921 --> 00:19:20.046
- She looks crazy.
- Don't say that.


243
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.338
When you pray,
ask for help loving your neighbor.


244
00:19:22.421 --> 00:19:23.963
She looks like a lunatic.

245
00:19:25.963 --> 00:19:29.213
- Where's Dad?
- He had a meeting, I think.


246
00:19:30.671 --> 00:19:32.588
- What's up, Mom?
- Nothing.


247
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:34.630
She's anxious. I know her.

248
00:19:34.713 --> 00:19:36.713
She was always more anxious
than her sister.


249
00:19:36.796 --> 00:19:38.671
- It's true.
- Speaking of Beba.


250
00:19:38.755 --> 00:19:43.046
She's thinking of hosting
Grandma's 80th birthday party.


251
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:44.963
She says she forgives you--

252
00:19:45.046 --> 00:19:46.338
She forgives me?

253
00:19:46.421 --> 00:19:47.380
Why not?

254
00:19:47.463 --> 00:19:48.713
<i>She's</i> forgiving <i>me</i>?

255
00:19:50.755 --> 00:19:53.005
Bury the hatchet. 
She's your only sister.

256
00:19:53.755 --> 00:19:56.171
Have you forgotten
what your aunt said to me?


257
00:19:56.255 --> 00:19:57.880
- About Dad?
- Yes, about Dad.


258
00:19:57.963 --> 00:20:00.088
She said, "If my marriage
was as dead as yours..."


259
00:20:00.171 --> 00:20:01.421
"I'd rather get divorced."

260
00:20:01.505 --> 00:20:02.755
- Don't mock me.
- I'm not.


261
00:20:02.838 --> 00:20:05.338
You wouldn't like it
if your sister said that to you.


262
00:20:05.421 --> 00:20:06.880
I don't have a sister, Mom.

263
00:20:07.713 --> 00:20:10.046
Inesita, have you put on weight?

264
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:11.421
I gave up smoking.

265
00:20:11.505 --> 00:20:13.505
I decided on a birthday present for you.

266
00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:15.713
- Don't tell me.
- A new wig.


267
00:20:15.796 --> 00:20:17.296
Just what I wanted.

268
00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.046
I need some air.
Something smells bad. I need...


269
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:22.921
There's no smell, Mom. 
I'll come with you.

270
00:20:23.005 --> 00:20:24.671
Norma, please don't make a scene.

271
00:20:24.755 --> 00:20:27.588
That's a window. It doesn't open.
Let's go that way.


272
00:20:27.671 --> 00:20:29.005
Look.

273
00:20:29.088 --> 00:20:31.005
- That doesn't open either.
- Waiter!


274
00:20:31.088 --> 00:20:33.380
- That way. Come on.
- This chicken is raw.


275
00:20:33.463 --> 00:20:36.796
It needs salt, it's raw,
and these vegetables are unchewable.


276
00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.546
And... a flower?

277
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.588
- What did you take?
- The pills make me sick.


278
00:20:40.671 --> 00:20:43.171
I'll end up in an asylum
or becoming a Breatharian...


279
00:20:43.255 --> 00:20:44.296
No.

280
00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.213
...and dying under a tree
trying to feed on air.


281
00:20:47.296 --> 00:20:50.255
This is just anxiety. Calm down.
Shall I come with you?


282
00:20:50.338 --> 00:20:52.671
No. I can't breathe in Las Tucas.

283
00:20:52.755 --> 00:20:55.338
Go back to Grandma
before she makes a scene.


284
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:58.588
- Let me know... Slow down!
- For a photo, yes, but to eat?


285
00:21:27.338 --> 00:21:28.338
Are you okay?

286
00:21:28.838 --> 00:21:29.880
I needed some air.

287
00:21:30.671 --> 00:21:32.171
<i>Okay, breathe normally.</i>

288
00:21:34.796 --> 00:21:36.046
Breathe from lower down.

289
00:21:36.546 --> 00:21:38.046
From here, from your core.

290
00:21:39.046 --> 00:21:41.963
That's it. In through your nose,
out through your mouth.


291
00:21:43.463 --> 00:21:44.796
Unclench.

292
00:21:48.588 --> 00:21:49.838
Relax.

293
00:21:59.671 --> 00:22:01.921
Watch the wind. What a gift.

294
00:22:04.088 --> 00:22:05.255
Beautiful.

295
00:22:06.671 --> 00:22:08.546
Let go of any negative thoughts.

296
00:22:09.255 --> 00:22:10.546
Feel it in your face.

297
00:22:13.171 --> 00:22:14.380
Close your eyes.

298
00:22:24.755 --> 00:22:25.755
Better?

299
00:22:26.755 --> 00:22:27.755
Thank you.

300
00:22:28.796 --> 00:22:30.171
- Hello.
- Hello.


301
00:22:30.796 --> 00:22:32.088
I'm Judith.

302
00:22:33.421 --> 00:22:37.130
Two guys came out from behind a tree,
each holding a knife,


303
00:22:37.213 --> 00:22:38.963
both high on drugs.

304
00:22:39.046 --> 00:22:42.005
The corner store on the square
is where drug addicts hang out.


305
00:22:42.088 --> 00:22:44.380
- I think they sell drugs there.
- Awful!


306
00:22:44.463 --> 00:22:47.463
When I was young,
there weren't so many drugs around.


307
00:22:47.546 --> 00:22:51.296
- Now they're everywhere.
- Yes, you're absolutely right.


308
00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.880
A friend of mine went to see
that psychologist from Buenos Aires.


309
00:22:54.963 --> 00:22:56.963
The one who does alternative therapies.

310
00:22:58.005 --> 00:23:01.505
She recommended
that she smoked I don't know what


311
00:23:02.005 --> 00:23:03.671
and that she hugged a tree!

312
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.963
- What did your friend do?
- She didn't go back.


313
00:23:07.588 --> 00:23:10.671
<i>Apparently, they broke into
the house of an engineer.</i>


314
00:23:10.755 --> 00:23:11.963
<i>It was planned.</i>

315
00:23:12.046 --> 00:23:15.213
<i>They waited by the gate
in a stolen vehicle.</i>


316
00:23:15.296 --> 00:23:17.505
<i>When the owners went out...</i>

317
00:23:19.796 --> 00:23:24.005
<i>...they went straight to the safe,
because they were clearly tipped off.</i>


318
00:23:24.088 --> 00:23:28.213
<i>They forced the safe open
and stole three vintage Rolex watches,</i>


319
00:23:28.296 --> 00:23:31.963
<i>one million pesos in cash,
and 20,000 dollars.</i>


320
00:23:32.046 --> 00:23:34.296
<i>This is the country we live in, listeners.</i>

321
00:23:35.171 --> 00:23:37.630
<i>This is how Argentinians have to live.</i>

322
00:23:54.546 --> 00:23:56.046
Where are my pills?

323
00:26:26.088 --> 00:26:28.671
Norma!

324
00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.088
- Are you all right?
- Yes.


325
00:26:39.005 --> 00:26:40.963
- What happened?
- Nothing.


326
00:26:41.046 --> 00:26:42.421
What do you mean, nothing?

327
00:26:42.505 --> 00:26:44.005
I was floating.

328
00:26:45.505 --> 00:26:47.546
You got in the pool dressed like that?

329
00:26:50.505 --> 00:26:53.505
- Go get changed. You'll catch cold.
- It's not cold.


330
00:26:58.255 --> 00:26:59.880
Did you think I was dead?

331
00:27:01.296 --> 00:27:03.671
- You're crazy.
- I scared you, huh?


332
00:27:04.296 --> 00:27:05.671
It's not funny.

333
00:27:05.755 --> 00:27:10.088
If I die, it solves
all your problems, right?


334
00:27:46.963 --> 00:27:48.463
Such a lovely fire.

335
00:27:49.005 --> 00:27:50.005
Yeah.

336
00:27:52.088 --> 00:27:54.380
I find it calming to watch it.

337
00:27:56.463 --> 00:27:57.671
Like the sea.

338
00:28:20.546 --> 00:28:21.713
Coming!

339
00:28:21.796 --> 00:28:23.213
Hurry up. We're late!

340
00:28:25.088 --> 00:28:27.296
- I'm coming!
- What's that smell?


341
00:28:28.671 --> 00:28:30.005
Is something burning?

342
00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.671
- I burned some incense.
- It smells awful.


343
00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:37.713
Hurry up, please. Let's go.

344
00:28:57.463 --> 00:28:59.296
- Hello?
- You changed the code?


345
00:28:59.963 --> 00:29:01.171
- Hey.
- Yes.


346
00:29:02.005 --> 00:29:03.338
Come on. We're late.

347
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.380
I'll call to get it deactivated.

348
00:29:09.838 --> 00:29:14.921
Hello. Gustavo Blanco.
Can you come and turn this racket off?


349
00:29:15.713 --> 00:29:19.421
Two, one, zero, nine. My birthday.
We never change it.


350
00:29:29.796 --> 00:29:31.421
A ladybug.

351
00:29:31.505 --> 00:29:33.213
Norma! Come on, please.

352
00:29:35.671 --> 00:29:38.296
Gus, Norma, you're here at last!

353
00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.380
Good evening.

354
00:29:39.463 --> 00:29:41.005
- Come in!
- Hi.


355
00:29:42.088 --> 00:29:43.838
- Look at that lipstick!
- What?


356
00:29:43.921 --> 00:29:46.880
- Are you going out dancing later?
- No.


357
00:29:46.963 --> 00:29:49.255
- Is it too much?
- No, you look fantastic.


358
00:29:49.338 --> 00:29:51.505
I'm trying new things.

359
00:29:51.588 --> 00:29:53.505
Welcome, new Norma!

360
00:29:53.588 --> 00:29:56.005
Turca! Where's Turca?

361
00:29:56.713 --> 00:29:58.505
I'm here!

362
00:30:10.171 --> 00:30:11.880
For you, only champagne.

363
00:30:11.963 --> 00:30:14.213
- Thank you.
- Go easy on the alcohol, Norma.


364
00:30:14.296 --> 00:30:15.963
You'll have a headache tomorrow.

365
00:30:16.046 --> 00:30:17.255
Just a small glass.

366
00:30:18.088 --> 00:30:19.588
So you're fixing up the cottage?

367
00:30:21.005 --> 00:30:22.213
I'm building a greenhouse.

368
00:30:22.296 --> 00:30:24.171
- It's not safe there.
- That's what I said.


369
00:30:25.255 --> 00:30:26.338
I'll be fine.

370
00:30:26.421 --> 00:30:28.171
I was just walking along, 3:00 p.m.

371
00:30:28.255 --> 00:30:30.838
Held at gunpoint for half an hour.
Can you imagine?


372
00:30:30.921 --> 00:30:34.088
But you had 200,000 dollars on you.

373
00:30:34.171 --> 00:30:35.296
Somebody knew.

374
00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:42.005
You invited my sister?

375
00:30:43.088 --> 00:30:44.755
Why didn't you tell me?

376
00:30:45.671 --> 00:30:47.671
She called to congratulate Turco.

377
00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.838
I'm sorry, Norma.

378
00:30:49.921 --> 00:30:53.546
I didn't know you'd react like this.
Can you forgive me?


379
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:55.380
Let me know next time.

380
00:30:56.755 --> 00:30:59.296
- I'll go say hello. Are you coming?
- No.


381
00:31:03.588 --> 00:31:06.088
Everyone okay over here? Yes? Great.

382
00:31:06.963 --> 00:31:08.713
Welcome!

383
00:31:09.505 --> 00:31:10.755
I hardly recognize you.

384
00:31:11.671 --> 00:31:13.171
You just sat there.

385
00:31:14.671 --> 00:31:16.171
And this anger at your sister?

386
00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.130
Put it behind you.

387
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:21.796
It's a problem if I make a scene.
It's a problem if I don't.


388
00:31:22.296 --> 00:31:23.630
The AC is on.

389
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:26.546
I need air. I
can't breathe in Las Tucas.

390
00:31:40.796 --> 00:31:43.338
- Actually, four.
- I'm here with Grandma.


391
00:31:43.421 --> 00:31:45.505
- Hi, Dad. How are you?
- My darling.


392
00:31:45.588 --> 00:31:47.755
- Good. You?
- Good. Excuse me.


393
00:31:47.838 --> 00:31:49.005
Hi, Mom.

394
00:31:49.088 --> 00:31:51.213
- How are you?
- Good. You look lovely.


395
00:31:51.296 --> 00:31:53.588
- Happy birthday, Mom.
- Hi, Alina.


396
00:31:53.671 --> 00:31:55.171
What strong perfume!

397
00:31:55.255 --> 00:31:58.171
- You look awful. Did you sleep badly?
- You look lovely too.


398
00:31:58.255 --> 00:31:59.296
Who's she?

399
00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:01.546
- Alina, my friend.
- She's put on weight.


400
00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:03.963
- I quit smoking.
- Don't say these things, Mom.


401
00:32:04.046 --> 00:32:05.671
Well, someone has to say it.

402
00:32:05.755 --> 00:32:07.005
Turn that off!

403
00:32:07.088 --> 00:32:10.671
I'm not missing my telenovela today.

404
00:32:10.755 --> 00:32:13.255
Today we find out
if she's a man or a woman.


405
00:32:13.963 --> 00:32:16.130
Well, turn the volume down!

406
00:32:16.213 --> 00:32:18.880
<i>I was resting, Mr. 
Carlos Alberto.</i>

407
00:32:21.171 --> 00:32:23.505
<i>I wanted to ask
how your work is going...</i>

408
00:32:24.671 --> 00:32:26.046
Five, six...

409
00:32:33.421 --> 00:32:35.546
- What are you doing in here, Mom?
- Come in.


410
00:32:40.588 --> 00:32:41.588
What's wrong?

411
00:32:41.671 --> 00:32:43.630
I can't stand it anymore.

412
00:32:44.338 --> 00:32:47.380
- I can't stand it.
- You know what Grandma's like.


413
00:32:48.171 --> 00:32:50.046
It's making me feel sick.

414
00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.588
Listen, we need to have one of those
serious mother-daughter conversations.


415
00:32:55.671 --> 00:32:56.505
Yes.

416
00:32:57.005 --> 00:32:59.255
- You need to find a moment.
- Yes, but not now.


417
00:32:59.338 --> 00:33:02.463
- No, not now.
- Right now I'm feeling claustrophobic.


418
00:33:02.546 --> 00:33:03.796
Sure.

419
00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.588
Don't argue. He's deceiving you.

420
00:33:06.671 --> 00:33:08.838
He's deceiving you. Wake up!

421
00:33:11.338 --> 00:33:12.963
Come out of there, Mom.

422
00:34:08.005 --> 00:34:11.005
Answer your phone, Mom.
That's yours ringing.


423
00:34:14.755 --> 00:34:18.421
Gustavo, can you get Mom's phone?
She hasn't got her hearing aids in.


424
00:34:18.505 --> 00:34:20.755
It will be someone wanting to say hello.

425
00:34:22.046 --> 00:34:25.088
- Dad, phone!
- Okay.


426
00:34:25.963 --> 00:34:27.463
Phone call for you.

427
00:34:29.546 --> 00:34:32.296
- Answer it, Grandma.
- Hello?


428
00:34:33.046 --> 00:34:35.296
Oh, Bebita. Yes, honey.

429
00:34:35.838 --> 00:34:37.671
- Damn it.
- What happened?


430
00:34:38.713 --> 00:34:40.588
- What's broken?
- Did you cut yourself?


431
00:34:40.671 --> 00:34:42.505
- I'm fine.
- Is something broken?


432
00:34:42.588 --> 00:34:44.380
Can you get me a Band
-Aid, please?

433
00:34:44.463 --> 00:34:47.296
Didn't I tell you? 
She was a woman.

434
00:34:48.088 --> 00:34:49.588
Thank you.

435
00:34:49.671 --> 00:34:50.796
Who was it?

436
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.713
It was Beba. She's waiting outside.

437
00:34:52.796 --> 00:34:54.130
- What?
- I'm going.


438
00:34:54.213 --> 00:34:55.880
Gustavo was going to take you, Mom.

439
00:34:55.963 --> 00:34:57.838
No, I don't want to bother him.

440
00:35:13.338 --> 00:35:15.130
Are you going through my bag?

441
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:18.421
I was looking for a tranquilizer.

442
00:35:20.338 --> 00:35:21.630
Why are you laughing?

443
00:35:22.296 --> 00:35:25.296
- What's in the box?
- Just ask, Mom. Nothing.


444
00:35:26.505 --> 00:35:27.505
It's empty.

445
00:35:29.338 --> 00:35:30.755
Well, do you have one?

446
00:35:30.838 --> 00:35:31.921
Yes, I do.

447
00:35:34.088 --> 00:35:37.171
Look, it's my present for your grandma.
She left it here.


448
00:35:37.255 --> 00:35:38.255
Well...

449
00:35:41.296 --> 00:35:43.171
Why don't you call Judith Breitman?

450
00:35:44.338 --> 00:35:45.505
Who's Judith Brenman?

451
00:35:46.005 --> 00:35:47.213
- Breitman.
- Who is that?


452
00:35:47.296 --> 00:35:49.546
The psychologist I mentioned,
from Buenos Aires.


453
00:35:50.088 --> 00:35:52.421
My patients are very happy with her.

454
00:35:53.505 --> 00:35:55.505
- I could do.
- Yes, Mom, you could.


455
00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.796
- Give it to me.
- One a day maximum.


456
00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:06.505
- Yes? Okay.
- Yes.


457
00:36:06.588 --> 00:36:07.588
Come on.

458
00:36:58.921 --> 00:37:02.755
I'VE GONE TO PLAY GOLF

459
00:37:17.755 --> 00:37:18.755
Okay.

460
00:37:33.088 --> 00:37:34.130
Thank you.

461
00:37:34.213 --> 00:37:35.588
The herbal tea at night.

462
00:37:35.671 --> 00:37:36.880
- Yes.
- Don't forget.


463
00:37:36.963 --> 00:37:38.796
- No, just like you said.
- Okay.


464
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.755
See you next time.

465
00:37:41.296 --> 00:37:42.296
Norma?

466
00:37:50.005 --> 00:37:51.921
- Cinnamon.
- What?


467
00:37:52.588 --> 00:37:53.671
The candles.

468
00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:56.505
- Yes.
- Very nice.


469
00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.963
How can I help, Norma?

470
00:38:02.213 --> 00:38:03.463
Help me?

471
00:38:04.505 --> 00:38:06.963
Yes. You said it was urgent
when you called.


472
00:38:07.588 --> 00:38:08.755
Me? Urgent?

473
00:38:08.838 --> 00:38:10.880
Yes, you said "urgent."

474
00:38:14.338 --> 00:38:15.338
Well, yes.

475
00:38:16.046 --> 00:38:17.921
You haven't been in therapy before.

476
00:38:18.005 --> 00:38:19.213
No.

477
00:38:19.296 --> 00:38:21.046
- No.
- Never, no.


478
00:38:22.171 --> 00:38:24.171
Can I ask you a question to start?

479
00:38:24.838 --> 00:38:27.713
Do people just open up
and tell you about their lives?


480
00:38:28.671 --> 00:38:31.255
Well, that takes time, doesn't it?

481
00:38:31.338 --> 00:38:34.171
It takes time to
open up, to build trust.

482
00:38:34.755 --> 00:38:37.588
But younger women
seem more inclined to open up


483
00:38:37.671 --> 00:38:39.671
and talk about themselves.

484
00:38:43.796 --> 00:38:46.296
- Can I tell you something?
- Yes.


485
00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:49.755
I'd never have chosen
to live in Las Tucas.


486
00:38:49.838 --> 00:38:50.838
Why not?

487
00:38:51.546 --> 00:38:53.213
The people, it's like...

488
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:55.963
I don't know. They think...

489
00:38:56.046 --> 00:38:59.838
that there's a way to do things
that's normal and...


490
00:39:00.463 --> 00:39:02.463
if you don't do that, you're not normal.

491
00:39:03.171 --> 00:39:07.130
And I live as if I'm normal,
but I'm not normal. I'm abnormal.


492
00:39:09.255 --> 00:39:10.755
Normal, abnormal.

493
00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:13.921
Can you do this time on Tuesdays?

494
00:39:14.005 --> 00:39:15.255
Tuesdays?

495
00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:20.463
Yes, Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I think twice a week to begin with.


496
00:39:20.546 --> 00:39:22.671
No.

497
00:39:22.755 --> 00:39:23.630
No.

498
00:39:23.713 --> 00:39:27.171
No, I'm not interested
in coming to therapy.


499
00:39:28.088 --> 00:39:28.921
No?

500
00:39:29.005 --> 00:39:30.755
Look, I...

501
00:39:30.838 --> 00:39:32.630
With my friends, I'm not...

502
00:39:33.588 --> 00:39:36.088
I'm not very sincere. I'm...

503
00:39:36.171 --> 00:39:37.963
Except with one. 
I am with Alina.

504
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:44.588
And the truth is
I'm not a young woman who can open up.


505
00:39:45.546 --> 00:39:49.838
So what I need, and
this is why I came,

506
00:39:49.921 --> 00:39:51.755
is a friend.

507
00:39:56.005 --> 00:39:57.838
Would you like to be my friend?

508
00:39:59.838 --> 00:40:01.171
Yes.

509
00:40:09.088 --> 00:40:10.213
What are you doing?

510
00:40:11.755 --> 00:40:12.963
I couldn't sleep.

511
00:40:14.671 --> 00:40:17.088
Drink this. I'll do you good.

512
00:40:17.171 --> 00:40:20.296
<i>We have a phone call.</i>

513
00:40:21.171 --> 00:40:22.255
<i>Let's see.</i>

514
00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.588
<i>- Who's calling?
- AdriÃ¡n, from ItuzaingÃ³.</i>


515
00:40:25.671 --> 00:40:26.796
<i>AdriÃ¡n!</i>

516
00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.963
<i>- Hi.
- So, AdriÃ¡n, listen...</i>


517
00:40:29.046 --> 00:40:30.130
Come to bed.

518
00:40:31.005 --> 00:40:33.713
Don't worry. You'll soon fall asleep.

519
00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.296
Count sheep.

520
00:40:39.005 --> 00:40:40.505
I should count sheep?

521
00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:45.713
Should I go live in the countryside
with Heidi and her grandfather too?


522
00:40:47.463 --> 00:40:48.671
What do you need, Norma?

523
00:40:48.755 --> 00:40:49.838
Sleep.

524
00:40:50.963 --> 00:40:52.838
Why don't you like the cruise idea?

525
00:40:55.755 --> 00:40:58.463
I want to you relax,
to get out of Las Tucas.


526
00:40:59.296 --> 00:41:02.088
Go out with Turca. Go shopping.

527
00:41:02.171 --> 00:41:04.713
Max out the credit card,
go to a spa, whatever.


528
00:41:07.421 --> 00:41:09.130
We're very worried about you.

529
00:41:10.255 --> 00:41:12.505
Who? You and Turca?

530
00:41:13.505 --> 00:41:14.588
InÃ©s and me.

531
00:42:38.505 --> 00:42:40.338
- Hello, good evening.
- Hello.


532
00:42:40.421 --> 00:42:43.713
I'm looking to buy...

533
00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.880
What?

534
00:42:47.088 --> 00:42:48.171
You know what.

535
00:42:48.255 --> 00:42:51.463
Everyone knows that this store sells...

536
00:42:51.546 --> 00:42:52.838
What? Condoms?

537
00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:56.713
No, cookies. This isn't funny to me.

538
00:42:56.796 --> 00:42:59.505
Please understand, 
I'm not here because...

539
00:42:59.588 --> 00:43:00.713
I'm very sick.

540
00:43:00.796 --> 00:43:04.546
I have a spinal injury.
I've heard this can help.


541
00:43:05.088 --> 00:43:07.505
I've also got arthritis, insomnia...

542
00:43:07.588 --> 00:43:10.796
I'm here talking to you
in the middle of the night. I need...


543
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.713
I brought cash.

544
00:43:13.296 --> 00:43:14.588
Okay, come in.

545
00:43:14.671 --> 00:43:17.421
- Where?
- The second door. Blue light.


546
00:43:33.338 --> 00:43:34.380
This way.

547
00:43:37.255 --> 00:43:38.421
You just want flower?

548
00:43:38.505 --> 00:43:39.588
Yes.

549
00:43:40.296 --> 00:43:41.338
What else is there?

550
00:43:41.421 --> 00:43:43.171
I have coke, acid...

551
00:43:43.255 --> 00:43:44.796
- No.
- MDMA.


552
00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.171
- All good stuff.
- No, thanks. Just flower.


553
00:43:47.255 --> 00:43:49.255
Top quality, extra premium.

554
00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:53.463
Come on.

555
00:43:58.921 --> 00:43:59.921
In here.

556
00:44:02.963 --> 00:44:04.171
Watch your step.

557
00:44:09.588 --> 00:44:10.588
This way.

558
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:17.630
Here. Look.

559
00:44:18.171 --> 00:44:19.421
Pack of nine

560
00:44:20.171 --> 00:44:21.421
or four.

561
00:44:22.255 --> 00:44:24.755
Okay, I'll... I'll take four.

562
00:44:24.838 --> 00:44:26.630
No, you'll take nine.

563
00:44:27.921 --> 00:44:31.296
- Okay. It would be rude not to.
- That's 50 dollars...


564
00:44:32.338 --> 00:44:33.880
at today's exchange rate.

565
00:44:38.963 --> 00:44:41.088
I'll go get yours. Try some.

566
00:44:41.171 --> 00:44:43.546
- No...
- Try it. I'll go get yours.


567
00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:47.421
And I'll check the exchange rate.
I'll be right back.


568
00:45:50.838 --> 00:45:51.838
Hi.

569
00:45:54.838 --> 00:45:58.588
Bad. It's my head. I have...

570
00:45:59.588 --> 00:46:01.088
a splitting headache.

571
00:46:02.005 --> 00:46:04.713
I was waiting for it to pass,
then I'll come.


572
00:46:06.255 --> 00:46:07.338
I don't know.

573
00:46:08.671 --> 00:46:10.088
You're going out?

574
00:46:12.463 --> 00:46:13.671
Where to?

575
00:46:15.671 --> 00:46:17.171
Will you be back late?

576
00:46:19.588 --> 00:46:21.588
It's so painful.

577
00:46:22.921 --> 00:46:25.963
Okay, in that case, 
I'll see you tomorrow.

578
00:46:26.463 --> 00:46:28.630
Okay. Ciao.

579
00:46:33.463 --> 00:46:35.463
<i>To understand</i>

580
00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:38.213
<i>What loneliness is like</i>

581
00:46:38.296 --> 00:46:40.213
<i>You have to see</i>

582
00:46:40.796 --> 00:46:42.963
<i>That he's no longer by your side</i>

583
00:46:43.046 --> 00:46:46.921
<i>The one who never let you think</i>

584
00:46:47.005 --> 00:46:49.171
<i>About where there was good</i>

585
00:46:49.255 --> 00:46:50.880
<i>And where there was evil</i>

586
00:46:50.963 --> 00:46:54.713
<i>Loneliness is a friend who's not around</i>

587
00:46:55.963 --> 00:46:59.963
<i>It's a voice you'll never hear</i>

588
00:47:01.255 --> 00:47:02.255
Coming!

589
00:47:02.338 --> 00:47:05.255
<i>...are lights that surround you</i>

590
00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:09.713
<i>You realize that now
he never has to die</i>

591
00:47:10.255 --> 00:47:11.880
<i>Never has to die</i>

592
00:47:11.963 --> 00:47:13.796
<i>As you watch...</i>

593
00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:14.921
Norma!

594
00:47:15.546 --> 00:47:16.546
Coming!

595
00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:19.171
- Norma!
- Yes.


596
00:47:19.255 --> 00:47:20.796
- Hi!
- I made it.


597
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:21.963
How are you?

598
00:47:22.463 --> 00:47:23.505
Hi.

599
00:47:23.588 --> 00:47:25.463
- Hi.
- I brought along two friends.


600
00:47:27.421 --> 00:47:28.463
Where are they?

601
00:47:28.546 --> 00:47:31.963
<i>-</i> Demi-sec and extra brut.
- I believed you.


602
00:47:32.046 --> 00:47:34.713
You said you only drink sparkling wine.

603
00:47:34.796 --> 00:47:35.713
- Right?
- Yes.


604
00:47:35.796 --> 00:47:38.296
- I don't want to drink alone today.
- Okay. Well...


605
00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:40.005
- Hello.
- Hello.


606
00:47:43.963 --> 00:47:44.963
Well...

607
00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:48.505
Hey, you live in such a lovely place.

608
00:47:48.588 --> 00:47:50.463
- Yes. Oh, I don't live here.
- No?


609
00:47:50.546 --> 00:47:52.046
No.

610
00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:53.713
- But come in.
- Yes.


611
00:47:53.796 --> 00:47:55.213
You can borrow it anytime.

612
00:47:55.296 --> 00:47:56.338
- Seriously?
- Yes.


613
00:47:56.421 --> 00:47:58.838
- I love it. I'll take you up on that.
- Good.


614
00:47:58.921 --> 00:48:03.255
"This is why the transformation of the old
becomes easy."


615
00:48:03.838 --> 00:48:05.588
"The old is left behind."

616
00:48:05.671 --> 00:48:07.463
"The new is introduced."

617
00:48:07.546 --> 00:48:09.505
"Both occur at the same time."

618
00:48:09.588 --> 00:48:11.213
"No harm is caused."

619
00:48:11.796 --> 00:48:14.005
"Groups of similar beings form."

620
00:48:14.088 --> 00:48:17.213
"The return is rooted in nature."

621
00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:21.963
Is that the end?

622
00:48:22.046 --> 00:48:23.005
For you.

623
00:48:26.505 --> 00:48:27.505
It's beautiful.

624
00:48:29.838 --> 00:48:31.630
I haven't felt like this in ages.

625
00:48:33.005 --> 00:48:34.130
Calm.

626
00:48:35.796 --> 00:48:38.380
Ever since I got married, 
I've always...

627
00:48:39.796 --> 00:48:43.421
focused on my husband,
my daughter, the family.


628
00:48:45.671 --> 00:48:46.880
Everything but me.

629
00:48:47.505 --> 00:48:49.088
But that's what I was taught.

630
00:48:49.588 --> 00:48:51.755
And do you agree
with what you were taught?


631
00:48:53.046 --> 00:48:54.796
Not with everything, of course.

632
00:48:56.088 --> 00:48:58.171
Do you think you're the same as before?

633
00:49:01.463 --> 00:49:03.213
Remember what the I Ching told you.

634
00:49:03.296 --> 00:49:04.505
What did it tell me?

635
00:49:06.005 --> 00:49:07.505
A time of change.

636
00:49:09.796 --> 00:49:11.713
And for the new to enter...

637
00:49:12.588 --> 00:49:13.880
For the new to enter.

638
00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:15.380
What?

639
00:49:16.671 --> 00:49:17.880
You have to...

640
00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.255
The old has to leave.

641
00:49:22.755 --> 00:49:25.005
- Law of karma.
- Law of karma.


642
00:49:27.505 --> 00:49:30.380
That must be Damiana.
I asked her to bring me something.


643
00:49:35.255 --> 00:49:36.505
Dami!

644
00:49:36.588 --> 00:49:37.546
Here!

645
00:49:38.046 --> 00:49:39.421
- What's up?
- How's it going?


646
00:49:39.921 --> 00:49:41.463
Hey, thanks for coming.

647
00:49:42.088 --> 00:49:43.380
- No problem.
- Thank you.


648
00:49:43.463 --> 00:49:45.255
Oh, I left my money in my bag.

649
00:49:45.338 --> 00:49:46.421
Back in a sec.

650
00:49:46.505 --> 00:49:48.171
Norma, Damiana.

651
00:49:48.255 --> 00:49:49.588
- Hi.
- Hi.


652
00:49:49.671 --> 00:49:51.046
How are you?

653
00:49:52.088 --> 00:49:53.838
You left empty-handed last time.

654
00:49:56.171 --> 00:49:57.046
Yes.

655
00:49:57.130 --> 00:49:59.005
- Do you want anything now?
- No.


656
00:49:59.088 --> 00:50:00.130
No, thank you.

657
00:50:00.213 --> 00:50:01.380
Are you sure?

658
00:50:01.463 --> 00:50:02.463
Yes.

659
00:50:08.088 --> 00:50:10.213
Well, go on. If you have any spare.

660
00:50:12.755 --> 00:50:14.046
Ten. Five.

661
00:50:17.005 --> 00:50:17.838
- Okay.
- Yes.


662
00:50:17.921 --> 00:50:19.713
- Five?
- No, that's plenty.


663
00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:23.588
I don't have any cash.
Can I pay you tomorrow?


664
00:50:24.421 --> 00:50:27.463
Sure. You won't run away
like last time though?


665
00:50:27.546 --> 00:50:30.838
- How much do I owe you?
- Eighty dollars at today's exchange rate.


666
00:50:30.921 --> 00:50:32.171
It went up.

667
00:50:32.255 --> 00:50:33.588
Inflation.

668
00:50:34.838 --> 00:50:36.546
Ready. Here it is.

669
00:50:37.463 --> 00:50:39.713
- Here. That's for you.
- Great.


670
00:50:39.796 --> 00:50:41.671
- And that's for me.
- There. Thanks.


671
00:50:41.755 --> 00:50:43.463
You're the best. Thank you.

672
00:50:43.546 --> 00:50:44.963
- Good luck.
- Safe journey.


673
00:50:46.463 --> 00:50:47.838
She's awesome.

674
00:50:48.421 --> 00:50:49.421
We've got it.

675
00:50:50.005 --> 00:50:52.588
These flowers Damiana sells are so good.

676
00:50:53.088 --> 00:50:54.338
Here, feel this.

677
00:50:55.963 --> 00:50:57.880
The seeds came from Holland.

678
00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:00.671
Smell it. It smells amazing.

679
00:51:03.171 --> 00:51:05.505
I went there once, a long time ago.

680
00:51:05.588 --> 00:51:07.213
Gustavo and I went together.

681
00:51:07.296 --> 00:51:08.380
It's legal there.

682
00:51:08.463 --> 00:51:10.046
- Did you smoke together?
- No.


683
00:51:10.796 --> 00:51:12.588
- Why not?
- No. Are you kidding?


684
00:51:13.255 --> 00:51:14.296
No.

685
00:51:22.255 --> 00:51:23.255
Want some?

686
00:51:24.838 --> 00:51:27.088
No, thanks. I don't like to take drugs.

687
00:51:27.171 --> 00:51:28.713
It's not a drug, it's a plant.

688
00:51:33.046 --> 00:51:34.213
It's better shared.

689
00:51:34.796 --> 00:51:36.880
Well, it would be rude not to.

690
00:51:54.963 --> 00:51:56.296
Is it coming back?

691
00:52:00.588 --> 00:52:02.296
It doesn't do anything for me.

692
00:52:04.088 --> 00:52:06.671
You know you have the same name
as Marylin Monroe?


693
00:52:09.171 --> 00:52:10.796
- What?
- Yes.


694
00:52:11.421 --> 00:52:12.838
Norma Jean.

695
00:52:13.755 --> 00:52:16.213
Who has the same name as Marylin Monroe?

696
00:52:16.296 --> 00:52:18.171
- She does.
- Me?


697
00:52:18.255 --> 00:52:19.755
You, of course.

698
00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:27.380
- Are you pulling my leg?
- No, I swear.


699
00:52:28.088 --> 00:52:29.588
Norma Jean.

700
00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:34.838
Norma Jean.

701
00:52:46.505 --> 00:52:47.963
You made me jump.

702
00:52:48.588 --> 00:52:50.921
- Hi.
- You took your time.


703
00:52:51.838 --> 00:52:53.505
Yes, sorry. I overslept.

704
00:52:53.588 --> 00:52:55.505
You said you weren't staying over.

705
00:52:56.171 --> 00:52:59.213
Also, someone made an offer
to buy the cottage.


706
00:53:02.213 --> 00:53:04.421
- An offer for what?
- To buy the cottage.


707
00:53:04.505 --> 00:53:05.505
No.

708
00:53:07.588 --> 00:53:09.171
The cottage isn't for sale.

709
00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:11.338
Then we should get an alarm.

710
00:53:12.296 --> 00:53:13.880
There's nothing valuable there.

711
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.046
What about you?

712
00:53:17.796 --> 00:53:20.046
Me? Am I valuable?

713
00:53:21.255 --> 00:53:22.546
You should see yourself.

714
00:53:24.171 --> 00:53:25.588
Why? What do I look like?

715
00:53:26.921 --> 00:53:28.546
I'm going to take a shower.

716
00:53:31.005 --> 00:53:32.505
Oh, Normita.

717
00:53:33.046 --> 00:53:36.088
What you're making is beautiful.
How interesting.


718
00:53:36.171 --> 00:53:38.005
- You like it?
- Yes, a lot.


719
00:53:38.755 --> 00:53:40.505
You're a genius.

720
00:53:44.921 --> 00:53:48.213
See? Look how you give it
a sense of movement.


721
00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.088
Let's see, Alina.

722
00:53:54.546 --> 00:53:55.963
- Do you like it?
- Yes.


723
00:53:56.046 --> 00:53:58.713
No, not so much.

724
00:53:59.255 --> 00:54:01.588
And why don't we like it?

725
00:54:02.755 --> 00:54:04.713
Because it doesn't utilize

726
00:54:04.796 --> 00:54:08.088
any of the techniques we're learning.

727
00:54:08.671 --> 00:54:09.671
Of course.

728
00:54:10.546 --> 00:54:12.796
What's that blob in the background?

729
00:54:15.213 --> 00:54:16.380
- This?
- Yes.


730
00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:17.755
That's me.

731
00:54:21.838 --> 00:54:24.046
Norma! Wait!

732
00:54:24.796 --> 00:54:25.796
Wait up.

733
00:54:27.046 --> 00:54:29.005
It's so lucky you're still here.

734
00:54:29.755 --> 00:54:31.338
I need to ask a favor.

735
00:54:32.005 --> 00:54:34.088
Sorry if you have things to do, but--

736
00:54:34.171 --> 00:54:36.005
- I don't.
- No? Well...


737
00:54:36.088 --> 00:54:39.796
- Can you give me a ride to the bank?
- Of course, Alina. Get in.


738
00:54:40.338 --> 00:54:42.505
Thank you for the loan.

739
00:54:42.588 --> 00:54:45.463
- There's no need.
- Yes, please.


740
00:54:45.546 --> 00:54:48.338
I'm very grateful,
but I want to pay you back.


741
00:54:48.421 --> 00:54:50.921
- I don't need it.
- I know. It doesn't matter.


742
00:54:51.463 --> 00:54:53.130
- Leave it there.
- Thank you.


743
00:54:53.213 --> 00:54:55.588
- Ask me anytime.
- I promise I will.


744
00:55:00.463 --> 00:55:02.588
There's a funny smell in here.

745
00:55:04.671 --> 00:55:05.963
Oh, it could be...

746
00:55:07.005 --> 00:55:10.380
I took some plants and herbs
to the cottage, so maybe...


747
00:55:10.463 --> 00:55:11.588
I took some rue.

748
00:55:12.171 --> 00:55:13.921
No, it's not rue.

749
00:55:14.796 --> 00:55:17.171
It smells like what my neighbor smokes.

750
00:55:17.838 --> 00:55:20.630
That neighbor I told you about that...

751
00:55:22.088 --> 00:55:24.463
waters his garden naked.

752
00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:29.213
He sings songs in Italian.

753
00:55:30.255 --> 00:55:34.213
He's a real character.
Yes, it's like what he smokes.


754
00:55:34.921 --> 00:55:36.005
I don't know.

755
00:55:40.671 --> 00:55:44.421
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome. Okay.


756
00:55:45.755 --> 00:55:48.171
I'd like to ask a favor. Another one.

757
00:55:49.296 --> 00:55:52.713
Would you keep a set
of keys to my house?

758
00:55:52.796 --> 00:55:54.963
Just in case. In
case I lose them, or...

759
00:55:55.755 --> 00:55:57.963
- Stop. Give them here.
- I'd feel much better.


760
00:55:58.046 --> 00:56:00.671
- It's no trouble at all.
- Thank you so much.


761
00:56:03.463 --> 00:56:06.005
Rosa? What's she doing here?

762
00:56:06.796 --> 00:56:09.713
She's working in an apartment
on the second floor.


763
00:56:12.963 --> 00:56:15.130
She should work wherever she's happiest.

764
00:56:18.255 --> 00:56:20.505
<i>...I had a twin brother.</i>

765
00:56:20.588 --> 00:56:21.463
Mom!

766
00:56:21.546 --> 00:56:23.463
<i>He was killed in my hometown because...</i>

767
00:56:23.546 --> 00:56:24.380
Mom?

768
00:56:24.463 --> 00:56:26.088
<i>...he would go out into the street</i>

769
00:56:26.171 --> 00:56:27.880
<i>dressed as a woman.</i>

770
00:56:32.088 --> 00:56:33.213
So dangerous.

771
00:56:34.005 --> 00:56:35.588
<i>He was very handsome.</i>

772
00:56:37.088 --> 00:56:39.213
<i>When I decided to run away from home,</i>

773
00:56:39.296 --> 00:56:42.755
<i>after my violent stepfather beat me,</i>

774
00:56:42.838 --> 00:56:46.005
<i>I took his ID
and passed myself off as him.</i>


775
00:56:46.671 --> 00:56:48.088
<i>Until now.</i>

776
00:56:48.838 --> 00:56:49.713
Mom?

777
00:56:49.796 --> 00:56:51.755
<i>It's not easy for
a woman on her own</i>

778
00:56:51.838 --> 00:56:54.213
<i>to make her way in the world.</i>

779
00:56:54.296 --> 00:56:57.380
<i>Such injustice!
You've suffered so much, Virginia.</i>


780
00:56:58.088 --> 00:56:59.380
<i>I will avenge you.</i>

781
00:56:59.463 --> 00:57:02.046
<i>- Every woman suffers...
- I swear I'll avenge you.</i>


782
00:57:02.546 --> 00:57:04.838
<i>...from the violence of men.</i>

783
00:57:06.838 --> 00:57:08.088
Oh, you're out here.

784
00:57:08.588 --> 00:57:10.921
<i>The fragrance of orange and lemon...</i>

785
00:57:11.005 --> 00:57:12.005
Mom?

786
00:57:13.463 --> 00:57:15.755
Mom? Mom!

787
00:57:15.838 --> 00:57:19.296
- <i>...your home will feel like a citrus grove.</i>
- No!


788
00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:22.046
<i>Sniff. Lemon scent in your home.</i>

789
00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:26.796
Why, Mom?

790
00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:29.171
Listen to Beba crying. Please.

791
00:57:29.963 --> 00:57:33.630
If she'd been the one who found Mom,
who knows what would have happened.


792
00:57:33.713 --> 00:57:36.046
- It hurts so much, Mom.
- Mom.


793
00:57:36.546 --> 00:57:39.088
Grandma died.
Let's have a peaceful wake, okay?


794
00:57:50.546 --> 00:57:51.796
It's just us now.

795
00:57:53.755 --> 00:57:54.755
Yes.

796
00:57:58.671 --> 00:58:01.505
If I ever said anything
that hurt you, I'm sorry.


797
00:58:04.796 --> 00:58:07.005
It's fine. It's in the past.

798
00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:14.671
Now Mom can't come between us,

799
00:58:14.755 --> 00:58:18.546
we could have a real relationship
without all her noise.


800
00:58:20.671 --> 00:58:22.005
She did what she could.

801
00:58:23.796 --> 00:58:26.505
Yes, but she didn't do it well.

802
00:58:29.421 --> 00:58:32.005
Don't be so harsh. 
It's in the past.

803
00:58:34.088 --> 00:58:35.880
Yes, maybe I'm being harsh.

804
00:58:41.755 --> 00:58:44.338
She never got to finish the telenovela.

805
01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.588
My deepest condolences.

806
01:00:40.505 --> 01:00:43.421
- I was very fond of your mother.
- I know.


807
01:00:44.296 --> 01:00:45.880
Poor Mom.

808
01:00:45.963 --> 01:00:49.755
- I took care of her for so many years.
- We'll miss her so much.


809
01:00:49.838 --> 01:00:51.838
Such a sweet lady.

810
01:00:52.505 --> 01:00:54.463
She left me all her wigs.

811
01:01:02.213 --> 01:01:04.505
Did you see that Rosa was there?

812
01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:09.421
She dyed her hair. It looks odd.

813
01:01:14.005 --> 01:01:15.880
Was the jacket she was wearing yours?

814
01:01:16.463 --> 01:01:17.796
It was Mom's.

815
01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.338
Mom gave it to me,
and I gave it to her.

816
01:01:21.671 --> 01:01:25.130
The law of karma.
You get what you give, as Judith says.


817
01:01:25.213 --> 01:01:27.546
Stop seeing that mess of a woman, please.

818
01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:29.963
- Don't call her a mess.
- Okay.


819
01:01:30.046 --> 01:01:31.213
She helps me.

820
01:01:32.296 --> 01:01:33.921
- Perfect.
- Everything okay, Mom?


821
01:01:34.463 --> 01:01:36.838
- Yes.
- Yes, I remember.


822
01:01:36.921 --> 01:01:39.005
She loved going out with you both.

823
01:01:39.963 --> 01:01:41.296
Poor Mom.

824
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:43.630
Sorry.

825
01:01:45.171 --> 01:01:46.796
She's letting her smoke inside.

826
01:01:48.255 --> 01:01:50.755
- What?
- She's letting her smoke inside.


827
01:01:50.838 --> 01:01:54.671
Dad, it's a day of grieving.
Let's not argue, please.


828
01:01:54.755 --> 01:01:56.380
Yes.

829
01:01:57.755 --> 01:01:58.755
Of course.

830
01:02:02.921 --> 01:02:03.921
Okay.

831
01:02:04.755 --> 01:02:08.546
Yes, call me whenever you want,
so we can talk about her.


832
01:02:09.796 --> 01:02:11.546
She'll be missed, yes.

833
01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:14.380
Poor thing.

834
01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:17.005
No, Norma is...

835
01:02:17.088 --> 01:02:18.921
- Norma's strong.
- Enough of that.


836
01:02:19.421 --> 01:02:21.588
Yes, sad, of course, but...

837
01:02:22.463 --> 01:02:24.546
I don't know if I can.

838
01:02:25.338 --> 01:02:26.338
I don't know.

839
01:02:28.213 --> 01:02:29.505
What's this?

840
01:02:30.713 --> 01:02:31.713
Yes.

841
01:02:34.671 --> 01:02:35.880
Okay.

842
01:02:36.755 --> 01:02:38.963
I'm sure it will do us good.

843
01:02:40.171 --> 01:02:41.630
- What?
- What's this, Mom?


844
01:02:41.713 --> 01:02:43.421
Did you search my bag?

845
01:02:44.421 --> 01:02:45.713
Why didn't you tell me?

846
01:02:46.255 --> 01:02:48.338
I don't talk about
what I don't get told.

847
01:02:48.838 --> 01:02:50.630
You hid it from me too.

848
01:02:51.796 --> 01:02:54.005
We both hid things. 
It's not good to lie.

849
01:02:54.088 --> 01:02:55.088
- No.
- No more lies.


850
01:02:55.713 --> 01:02:57.213
From now on,

851
01:02:58.588 --> 01:03:01.505
things have to change between us.

852
01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:03.130
Yes.

853
01:03:09.338 --> 01:03:10.838
It won't be easy,

854
01:03:11.505 --> 01:03:13.088
raising a daughter alone.

855
01:03:13.171 --> 01:03:14.755
She won't have a father.

856
01:03:16.338 --> 01:03:17.838
But she'll have a grandma

857
01:03:18.755 --> 01:03:20.005
who's beautiful.

858
01:03:22.171 --> 01:03:23.338
A daughter?

859
01:03:24.130 --> 01:03:27.380
- It's a girl? You know already?
- Yes, it's a girl.


860
01:03:30.963 --> 01:03:33.130
Are you going to tell the father?

861
01:03:36.463 --> 01:03:39.671
As I said, it was artificial insemination.
A sperm bank.


862
01:03:41.171 --> 01:03:42.213
- Yes.
- Yes?


863
01:03:43.255 --> 01:03:44.463
Yes.

864
01:03:46.671 --> 01:03:48.713
- Does that change anything for you?
- No.


865
01:03:48.796 --> 01:03:50.588
- Be honest.
- It changes nothing.


866
01:03:50.671 --> 01:03:53.963
If you were to kill someone,
I'd hide the body.


867
01:03:54.046 --> 01:03:55.546
Oh, Mom. No.

868
01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:56.630
Yes.

869
01:04:01.546 --> 01:04:03.463
I'll tell Dad some other time, yeah?

870
01:04:03.546 --> 01:04:06.088
Don't say anything. When I'm ready, I'll...

871
01:04:06.171 --> 01:04:07.546
- Yes, that's best.
- Yes.


872
01:04:08.963 --> 01:04:10.005
That's best.

873
01:04:16.796 --> 01:04:18.255
What would Grandma say?

874
01:04:24.255 --> 01:04:26.005
I'm the grandma now.

875
01:04:26.088 --> 01:04:27.088
Yes.

876
01:04:49.005 --> 01:04:52.005
FOR SALE

877
01:05:22.796 --> 01:05:23.963
Why are you out here?

878
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:25.880
I'm getting some air.

879
01:05:27.005 --> 01:05:27.880
Are you ready?

880
01:05:30.546 --> 01:05:31.546
I'm not going.

881
01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:34.130
Tell the Turcos I have a headache.

882
01:05:35.046 --> 01:05:35.921
Go on your own.

883
01:05:36.005 --> 01:05:38.796
- Are you going to stay here?
- Yes. Or I might go out.


884
01:05:39.338 --> 01:05:41.963
- Where are you going?
- To meet a friend.


885
01:05:42.046 --> 01:05:43.171
Who?

886
01:05:43.255 --> 01:05:44.255
Judith.

887
01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.088
Did you talk to InÃ©s?

888
01:05:47.588 --> 01:05:48.755
No, why?

889
01:05:48.838 --> 01:05:49.796
No reason.

890
01:05:50.796 --> 01:05:52.213
Okay, have fun.

891
01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.296
- Hi.
- Hi.


892
01:05:57.963 --> 01:05:59.088
I'm a bit early.

893
01:05:59.171 --> 01:06:01.213
Give me five minutes, okay?

894
01:06:27.421 --> 01:06:30.171
- Do you like it?
- Oh, sorry! You startled me!


895
01:06:30.255 --> 01:06:32.546
- You were mesmerized.
- Yes.


896
01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:35.546
Yes. Intimidating.

897
01:06:36.505 --> 01:06:41.005
The thing is, we all have one,
but very few people take a closer look.


898
01:06:43.796 --> 01:06:44.963
Yes.

899
01:06:45.046 --> 01:06:46.130
Are you all right?

900
01:06:46.671 --> 01:06:48.921
Yes. I'm going to be a grandma.

901
01:06:50.546 --> 01:06:53.463
- That's wonderful.
- Yes. InÃ©s is pregnant.


902
01:06:53.546 --> 01:06:56.963
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.


903
01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:57.963
Thank you.

904
01:06:58.046 --> 01:06:59.171
We should celebrate.

905
01:06:59.755 --> 01:07:00.630
What's this?

906
01:07:01.296 --> 01:07:02.171
Tequila.

907
01:07:02.755 --> 01:07:03.796
Never tried it.

908
01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:07.213
This is the perfect time, then.

909
01:07:07.838 --> 01:07:10.296
Look. Wait. Do what I do.

910
01:07:12.963 --> 01:07:13.963
Salt.

911
01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:18.171
Down in one.

912
01:07:18.671 --> 01:07:20.130
To becoming a grandmother.

913
01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:26.963
The lemon!

914
01:07:31.796 --> 01:07:32.713
That's intense!

915
01:07:33.296 --> 01:07:35.755
It's meant to be. 
Let's have another.

916
01:07:35.838 --> 01:07:37.171
- Really?
- Yes.


917
01:07:38.588 --> 01:07:39.463
Salt.

918
01:07:42.296 --> 01:07:43.380
To life.

919
01:07:43.963 --> 01:07:44.963
To life.

920
01:07:45.463 --> 01:07:46.546
Lehayim.

921
01:07:47.171 --> 01:07:48.088
Okay.

922
01:07:59.171 --> 01:08:00.421
Do you have kids?

923
01:08:04.255 --> 01:08:06.380
I adopted a five-year-old girl,

924
01:08:06.963 --> 01:08:08.755
who's a teenager now,

925
01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.755
but we stopped talking a while ago.

926
01:08:12.546 --> 01:08:14.171
She never accepted my ex.

927
01:08:14.255 --> 01:08:17.088
No. Don't give up.

928
01:08:17.171 --> 01:08:18.713
No, don't give up.

929
01:08:19.463 --> 01:08:22.963
You should call her.
Tell her how you feel.


930
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:24.963
You chose her, right?

931
01:08:27.546 --> 01:08:28.880
You're her mom.

932
01:08:33.046 --> 01:08:35.713
The photo, that's my ex.

933
01:08:41.505 --> 01:08:43.713
The photographer or the model?

934
01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:46.755
Both.

935
01:08:50.046 --> 01:08:51.546
I do like it, you know?

936
01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:54.255
The photo or the model?

937
01:08:55.046 --> 01:08:56.296
Both.

938
01:09:13.838 --> 01:09:16.338
The key is biting the lemon quickly.

939
01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:21.588
Come on. In here.

940
01:09:21.671 --> 01:09:23.505
Here? You're crazy.

941
01:09:24.171 --> 01:09:26.671
Do you know how many times
I've been past this place?


942
01:09:26.755 --> 01:09:28.588
I never dreamed of coming in.

943
01:09:28.671 --> 01:09:31.796
Jewish father, indigenous mother.

944
01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:36.046
This meeting of cultures,
but always this tension as well.


945
01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:39.838
And we traveled around a lot,
always moving to different cities.


946
01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.338
Are you listening?

947
01:09:43.588 --> 01:09:45.171
Yes!

948
01:09:45.796 --> 01:09:47.838
No, I was just people-watching.

949
01:09:47.921 --> 01:09:50.380
Where did they come from?
I've never seen them.


950
01:09:50.463 --> 01:09:54.171
Move a few centimeters,
and you discover another world.


951
01:09:55.796 --> 01:09:58.255
I love this. Such a good song.

952
01:09:58.338 --> 01:10:01.296
No. That's it. Listen.

953
01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:02.838
Yeah!

954
01:10:09.046 --> 01:10:11.880
That's it. We have to dance. Come on.

955
01:10:11.963 --> 01:10:13.796
- No.
- Why not?


956
01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.630
- Let's dance.
- I can't dance.


957
01:10:15.713 --> 01:10:17.463
What? That's why we're here.

958
01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:18.963
I'll dance from here.

959
01:10:19.046 --> 01:10:21.171
No, this is why we're here. Come on.

960
01:10:21.255 --> 01:10:23.921
- Okay. I'll follow you.
- Yes!


961
01:10:38.255 --> 01:10:39.671
Oh God!

962
01:10:40.463 --> 01:10:42.005
- No.
- I'm getting dizzy.


963
01:10:43.088 --> 01:10:45.921
- I'm already dizzy.
- That's how you should feel!


964
01:11:34.296 --> 01:11:35.713
- Norma!
- Hi!


965
01:11:36.421 --> 01:11:37.505
How are you?

966
01:11:38.046 --> 01:11:39.880
I'm surprised to see you here.

967
01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.838
- I said, I'm surprised to see you here.
- Yes.


968
01:11:42.921 --> 01:11:45.213
- My friend brought me here.
- Great.


969
01:11:45.296 --> 01:11:46.296
- Hi.
- Hi.


970
01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:48.338
- This is Judith. Roberto.
- Nice to meet you.


971
01:11:48.421 --> 01:11:51.880
- I don't know him.
- His name's GermÃ¡n. He just told me.


972
01:11:51.963 --> 01:11:53.588
- You're a good dancer.
- No.


973
01:11:53.671 --> 01:11:55.463
Yes, you are.

974
01:11:59.088 --> 01:12:00.296
Okay.

975
01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:02.588
- You're a good dancer too.
- No.


976
01:12:10.421 --> 01:12:12.380
It's this music, it's...

977
01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:24.421
I'm exhausted.

978
01:12:25.046 --> 01:12:27.171
I haven't been dancing in ages.

979
01:12:27.255 --> 01:12:30.463
<i>We were in a world of our own</i>

980
01:12:32.671 --> 01:12:36.505
<i>Taking a chance with our feelings</i>

981
01:12:37.963 --> 01:12:40.880
<i>Eyes closed, facing the wind</i>

982
01:12:43.296 --> 01:12:46.588
<i>Let's play again at being reborn</i>

983
01:12:48.671 --> 01:12:51.880
<i>Two parallel lines stretching off forever</i>

984
01:12:53.838 --> 01:12:57.088
<i>But let's remember just one moment</i>

985
01:12:59.130 --> 01:13:01.463
<i>- That knowing look
-</i> Sorry.


986
01:13:02.671 --> 01:13:05.296
I'll be back. I'm going to the bathroom.

987
01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.296
- Are you okay?
- Yes.


988
01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:14.088
<i>I can't let myself begin to forget...</i>

989
01:13:38.296 --> 01:13:39.296
Norma.

990
01:13:46.546 --> 01:13:50.046
<i>There's nothing virtuous about love</i>

991
01:13:50.130 --> 01:13:54.671
<i>Just people who share an evening</i>

992
01:13:54.755 --> 01:13:56.755
How long did you live in Greece?

993
01:13:56.838 --> 01:14:00.796
How many years of your life
did you spend in that place?


994
01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.213
Excuse me.

995
01:14:02.296 --> 01:14:03.796
- Excuse me.
- What?


996
01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:05.130
- Can I have a word?
- What?


997
01:14:05.213 --> 01:14:06.713
- I'm leaving.
- Really?


998
01:14:06.796 --> 01:14:07.796
- Yes.
- Already?


999
01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:11.671
- Yes because... I have to go.
- Are you okay to drive?


1000
01:14:11.755 --> 01:14:13.671
You stay. Yes, I'm fine.

1001
01:14:13.755 --> 01:14:16.088
- Okay, bye.
- Wait. Take this.


1002
01:14:16.171 --> 01:14:19.213
Put this on. It's a bit windy.

1003
01:14:19.296 --> 01:14:20.796
Okay. Ciao.

1004
01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.380
Ciao! Speak soon.

1005
01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:27.671
<i>I'm left with just your smell</i>

1006
01:14:27.755 --> 01:14:31.088
<i>And memories of the good times</i>

1007
01:15:39.255 --> 01:15:40.546
Here you are.

1008
01:16:19.505 --> 01:16:21.088
- Good evening.
- Good evening.


1009
01:16:21.171 --> 01:16:22.671
- Good evening.
- Good evening.


1010
01:16:23.963 --> 01:16:25.130
Good evening.

1011
01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:29.046
Can you tell me why you're parked here
at this time of night?


1012
01:16:29.130 --> 01:16:31.130
- Yes.
- We found the suspicious vehicle.


1013
01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:33.713
Suspicious? Excuse me?

1014
01:16:33.796 --> 01:16:37.171
I needed some air.
That's why I came out and parked here.


1015
01:16:39.963 --> 01:16:41.796
- Are you intoxicated?
- Of course not.


1016
01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:42.713
Are you sure?

1017
01:16:45.005 --> 01:16:45.880
No.

1018
01:16:45.963 --> 01:16:48.671
- License and registration, please.
- Okay.


1019
01:16:50.255 --> 01:16:51.588
Thank you.

1020
01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:55.046
It's been so long
since I had to show them.


1021
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:58.130
Driver's license
and vehicle registration, please.


1022
01:16:58.213 --> 01:17:00.338
Maybe look in the glove compartment?

1023
01:17:00.421 --> 01:17:03.838
No, I have them here,
but it's ages since I had to show them.


1024
01:17:03.921 --> 01:17:07.338
Everyone knows me here. 
Are you a local?

1025
01:17:07.421 --> 01:17:09.130
Yes, ma'am. I'm from Las Tucas.

1026
01:17:09.213 --> 01:17:11.755
I was born and raised here,
and I've never seen you.


1027
01:17:11.838 --> 01:17:16.421
My husband is the president...
of the Rural Society.


1028
01:17:16.505 --> 01:17:18.963
- Step away from the car.
- Are you arresting me?


1029
01:17:19.046 --> 01:17:20.588
Step away from the car!

1030
01:17:24.713 --> 01:17:29.005
This is unit 246, Officer MÃ©ndez.
Requesting backup and fire department.


1031
01:17:29.088 --> 01:17:32.005
I repeat, backup and fire department.

1032
01:17:42.838 --> 01:17:44.505
Kid, get your feet down.

1033
01:17:44.588 --> 01:17:47.088
<i>He's been arrested.
He was involved in an accident.</i>


1034
01:17:47.171 --> 01:17:49.213
You gave me such a scare, son.

1035
01:17:49.296 --> 01:17:51.671
What were you thinking,
stealing Dad's car?


1036
01:17:52.171 --> 01:17:53.880
Why didn't you answer your phone?

1037
01:17:53.963 --> 01:17:55.130
Where were you?

1038
01:17:55.755 --> 01:17:57.046
Look at me. Are you okay?

1039
01:18:04.005 --> 01:18:05.880
Norma Lera.

1040
01:18:08.796 --> 01:18:09.963
You don't remember me?

1041
01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:11.630
At all?

1042
01:18:15.505 --> 01:18:16.671
Help me out.

1043
01:18:16.755 --> 01:18:19.213
Aguirre. Gabriela Olga.

1044
01:18:19.296 --> 01:18:21.005
From school.

1045
01:18:22.463 --> 01:18:24.296
You were horrible to me, Lera.

1046
01:18:26.088 --> 01:18:27.963
Remember the things you did to me?

1047
01:18:28.046 --> 01:18:31.588
I'm sorry. You've changed so much.

1048
01:18:31.671 --> 01:18:32.880
In a bad way?

1049
01:18:32.963 --> 01:18:34.963
No, in a good way.

1050
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:37.296
What are you doing, Lera?

1051
01:18:38.338 --> 01:18:39.505
Are you a stoner?

1052
01:18:40.171 --> 01:18:41.671
At our age?

1053
01:18:42.255 --> 01:18:43.630
Aging pothead.

1054
01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:46.630
Your blood alcohol is through the roof.

1055
01:18:51.838 --> 01:18:52.963
What should we do?

1056
01:18:54.671 --> 01:18:56.921
Call the narcotics division?

1057
01:18:57.588 --> 01:18:58.463
No.

1058
01:18:58.546 --> 01:19:00.213
Or leave it here?

1059
01:19:01.005 --> 01:19:04.088
Yes, if we can, that would be best.

1060
01:19:10.713 --> 01:19:12.213
Yes. Right.

1061
01:19:19.463 --> 01:19:20.963
What? Did you lose something?

1062
01:19:21.046 --> 01:19:23.130
No.

1063
01:19:24.171 --> 01:19:28.380
My... lipstick,
but I didn't like it anyway, so...


1064
01:19:28.463 --> 01:19:30.921
Lera, someone came to pick you up.

1065
01:19:36.088 --> 01:19:37.088
Well...

1066
01:19:38.171 --> 01:19:39.296
Thank you, Aguirre.

1067
01:19:40.255 --> 01:19:41.588
- Go on.
- Ciao.


1068
01:19:42.921 --> 01:19:44.421
Be good, Normita.

1069
01:19:55.588 --> 01:19:58.296
- I ruined your date.
- No, forget about it.


1070
01:19:58.796 --> 01:20:02.588
He was a right-wing flat-earther
wearing a white jacket.


1071
01:20:03.505 --> 01:20:05.671
I should be thanking you.

1072
01:20:52.630 --> 01:20:55.296
I'VE GONE TO PLAY GOLF

1073
01:21:19.546 --> 01:21:22.088
Watch the gearshift.
It's not automatic like yours.


1074
01:21:22.171 --> 01:21:24.130
No, I know. Thanks.

1075
01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:25.796
- Don't set it on fire.
- No.


1076
01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:27.463
- Please.
- Don't worry.


1077
01:21:27.546 --> 01:21:30.505
- I'm more clearheaded than ever.
- I called my daughter.


1078
01:21:30.588 --> 01:21:32.421
- And?
- I asked her to come visit.


1079
01:21:32.505 --> 01:21:34.380
- Let's see if she accepts.
- She will.


1080
01:21:34.463 --> 01:21:37.505
- Thank you. You were great with that.
- I'm happy for you.


1081
01:21:37.588 --> 01:21:39.463
- Okay. Wish me luck.
- Good luck.


1082
01:21:39.546 --> 01:21:41.088
- Keep me posted?
- Yes.


1083
01:22:49.338 --> 01:22:50.463
Hi, Fernandito.

1084
01:23:06.713 --> 01:23:08.463
I'm at the gate. 
I just arrived.

1085
01:23:09.171 --> 01:23:10.255
I'm here.

1086
01:23:10.963 --> 01:23:12.005
I'm here now.

1087
01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:38.255
- Hello, my love.
- Hello.


1088
01:23:39.671 --> 01:23:41.713
I've been waiting for you.

1089
01:23:41.796 --> 01:23:44.671
- I'm here.
- I missed you so much.


1090
01:23:44.755 --> 01:23:46.255
I missed you too.

1091
01:23:47.005 --> 01:23:48.046
I missed you too.

1092
01:23:48.671 --> 01:23:49.671
Norma.

1093
01:23:56.463 --> 01:23:57.505
Norma!

1094
01:23:58.505 --> 01:23:59.505
Norma!

1095
01:24:06.713 --> 01:24:07.838
I fell in love.

1096
01:24:10.796 --> 01:24:12.921
Then I hope you're happy together.

1097
01:24:24.671 --> 01:24:27.671
YOU ARE LEAVING LAS TUCAS

1098
01:24:31.171 --> 01:24:33.130
FOR SALE

1099
01:24:37.046 --> 01:24:40.005
When you're done,
come in and I'll pay you.


1100
01:24:40.088 --> 01:24:41.380
Perfect.

1101
01:24:41.463 --> 01:24:43.130
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Yes.


1102
01:24:43.213 --> 01:24:45.630
Can you take down that "For Sale" sign?

1103
01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:48.255
- Sure.
- Thank you.


1104
01:25:07.171 --> 01:25:08.255
Hi, Claudio.

1105
01:25:29.171 --> 01:25:32.296
I fell asleep in your bed.

1106
01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:36.088
- Sorry.
- I didn't want to wake you.


1107
01:25:36.171 --> 01:25:38.338
- You were worn out.
- Were you uncomfortable?


1108
01:25:38.421 --> 01:25:40.296
Not at all, no.

1109
01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.171
It's such a nice day.

1110
01:25:47.296 --> 01:25:49.421
How did the movie end last night?

1111
01:25:50.671 --> 01:25:52.505
It had a happy ending.

1112
01:25:53.671 --> 01:25:55.046
Like all movies.

1113
01:25:56.171 --> 01:25:58.921
Romantic movies
are so bad for us, aren't they?


1114
01:25:59.005 --> 01:26:00.005
Yes.

1115
01:26:02.546 --> 01:26:04.213
What?

1116
01:26:04.296 --> 01:26:07.963
- Happy birthday!
- I thought you'd forgotten.


1117
01:26:08.046 --> 01:26:10.213
How could I forget?

1118
01:26:10.296 --> 01:26:12.713
I don't know. I can't reveal anything.

1119
01:26:12.796 --> 01:26:13.963
Do you know?

1120
01:26:16.796 --> 01:26:18.130
Let's see.

1121
01:26:20.713 --> 01:26:21.796
No!

1122
01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.421
- So many plants!
- So beautiful.


1123
01:26:23.505 --> 01:26:25.005

A little, yes.

1133
