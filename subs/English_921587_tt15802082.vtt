5
00:00:26.787 --> 00:00:27.787
Ah!

6
00:00:33.653 --> 00:00:37.320
Bella, your pronunciation
is getting molto bene.


7
00:00:37.453 --> 00:00:39.653
Okay, so, spaghetti.

8
00:00:39.787 --> 00:00:40.653
Chicken parm.

9
00:00:40.787 --> 00:00:42.186
Extra spaghetti.

10
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.186
Extra-

11
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.186
Mama Tucci, this is too much.

12
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.787
Nah, there's no such thing.

13
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.787
Well, I'll have plenty of
leftovers for my coworkers.


14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.820
Good.

15
00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:50.954
Are you sure you don't
mind watching Amy again?


16
00:00:51.087 --> 00:00:52.286
No, it's my pleasure.

17
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.820
I promise I won't be too late.

18
00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:55.787
Bye, pumpkin.
- Bye, Dad.


19
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.353
Oh, my Amy.

20
00:00:58.487 --> 00:01:00.520
You're such a strong girl.

21
00:01:00.653 --> 00:01:01.587
Just like you, Mama.

22
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.353
Ah!

23
00:01:03.487 --> 00:01:04.553
Uh!

24
00:01:04.687 --> 00:01:05.753
So we're gonna
make the primavera?


25
00:01:05.887 --> 00:01:07.020
- Yeah.
- Okay.


26
00:01:07.153 --> 00:01:08.520
Let's get cooking!

27
00:01:09.653 --> 00:01:10.520
Grazie!

28
00:01:12.887 --> 00:01:15.920
Woo!

29
00:01:16.054 --> 00:01:17.186
Cool, Mama.

30
00:01:33.687 --> 00:01:35.054
Welcome, everyone.

31
00:01:35.186 --> 00:01:36.653
Hello. Good evening.

32
00:01:38.054 --> 00:01:41.753
So, for those of you who
are new here tonight,


33
00:01:41.887 --> 00:01:46.020
Family Dinner Fridays is
a tradition that my nonna


34
00:01:46.153 --> 00:01:49.753
started back in
Napali way back when.


35
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.386
She would invite the
entire neighborhood


36
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.220
to come and share a meal.

37
00:01:55.353 --> 00:01:59.253
So to continue her
legacy and honor Nonna,


38
00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:04.420
we welcome you to our
Friday Night Supper Club.


39
00:02:05.386 --> 00:02:06.920
We care about our customers.

40
00:02:07.054 --> 00:02:08.820
We treat you like family.

41
00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:11.453
So you're a part of
the Tucci family now.


42
00:02:11.587 --> 00:02:13.253
Whether you like it or not.

43
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.820
So.

44
00:02:16.954 --> 00:02:18.087
A Nonna.

45
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.186
- A Nonna.
- A Nonna.


46
00:02:23.453 --> 00:02:24.753
Amy?

47
00:02:24.887 --> 00:02:25.887
Amy?

48
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.253
Earth to Amy, do you copy?

49
00:02:29.386 --> 00:02:30.487
Oh.

50
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.653
I gotta take that
pasta to table nine,


51
00:02:31.787 --> 00:02:32.653
unless you want to
stare at it longer?


52
00:02:32.787 --> 00:02:34.386
No, no, it's all yours.

53
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.653
I used to be like
that primavera.


54
00:02:40.787 --> 00:02:42.087
Bold.

55
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.087
Full of life.

56
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.220
Flavor.

57
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.653
What happened to me, Christine?

58
00:02:46.787 --> 00:02:48.153
You're still all those things.

59
00:02:48.286 --> 00:02:50.253
You're just stuck in a
rut right now, that's all.


60
00:02:50.386 --> 00:02:53.253
How long do I have to toil
away as a mid-level manager


61
00:02:53.386 --> 00:02:55.653
before I finally get
the next opportunity?


62
00:02:55.787 --> 00:02:57.120
What if this is it for me?

63
00:02:57.253 --> 00:02:59.320
I'm still singing our
cheesy Happy Birthday songs


64
00:02:59.453 --> 00:03:01.054
to customers when I'm 90.

65
00:03:01.186 --> 00:03:02.520
Okay, well, you're
being dramatic.


66
00:03:02.653 --> 00:03:05.020
Things don't change
for me around here soon,


67
00:03:05.153 --> 00:03:06.553
I'm movin' on.

68
00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:09.520
You decided all that just
by staring at some pasta?


69
00:03:09.653 --> 00:03:12.054
Usually that just
gets me into trouble.


70
00:03:12.186 --> 00:03:14.087
Okay, it wasn't
just the primavera.


71
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.487
Oh.

72
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.553
Mama?

73
00:03:18.687 --> 00:03:19.820
Yeah.

74
00:03:19.954 --> 00:03:22.020
We've been playing
phone tag lately.


75
00:03:22.153 --> 00:03:23.487
Could really use her
advice right about now.


76
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.987
Well, maybe today's
the day things change.


77
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.453
Everyone gather round.

78
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.054
As you know, we've been
interviewing applicants


79
00:03:34.186 --> 00:03:36.186
for the permanent
manager position.


80
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.186
I know you've all been anxious
to hear who we've selected.


81
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.153
It's my pleasure to announce

82
00:03:41.286 --> 00:03:42.787
that the honor goes to

83
00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:47.153
Benjamin Stewart from our
Upper East Side location.


84
00:03:47.286 --> 00:03:48.320
Let's make sure he feels welcome

85
00:03:48.453 --> 00:03:49.620
when he arrives this afternoon.

86
00:03:49.753 --> 00:03:50.653
Okay, back to work.

87
00:03:50.787 --> 00:03:52.553
Thank you.

88
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.720
Hey, Nunzio, table four.

89
00:04:03.854 --> 00:04:05.420
Clean it, please.

90
00:04:05.553 --> 00:04:06.954
De facto.

91
00:04:07.087 --> 00:04:09.220
All right, I dare you to find
me a more perfect tiramisu.


92
00:04:09.353 --> 00:04:10.954
Outside of Italy, that is.

93
00:04:11.087 --> 00:04:12.720
Frank, uh, listen,
I know there's a lot


94
00:04:12.854 --> 00:04:13.920
been going on lately,

95
00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:16.054
but you really should
slow down a little.


96
00:04:16.186 --> 00:04:17.286
You really shouldn't
rush your craft,


97
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.887
especially on a day
like today, right?


98
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.920
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

99
00:04:20.054 --> 00:04:20.954
What are you doin'?

100
00:04:21.087 --> 00:04:22.054
What are you?

101
00:04:22.186 --> 00:04:23.253
I'm a server, so
I'm gonna serve.


102
00:04:23.386 --> 00:04:24.753
No, uh, the chef will
deliver the dessert.


103
00:04:24.887 --> 00:04:25.954
Frank, come on.

104
00:04:26.087 --> 00:04:27.420
We really can't afford
a bad review today.


105
00:04:27.553 --> 00:04:29.386
Okay, Kimberly may
be a tough critic,


106
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.220
grant you that, but
there's no way she doesn't


107
00:04:31.353 --> 00:04:32.753
fall head over heels
in love with this.


108
00:04:32.887 --> 00:04:34.720
I know, it's nice,
but you know your menu


109
00:04:34.854 --> 00:04:36.687
has its detractors, right?

110
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.720
Ah.

111
00:04:37.854 --> 00:04:39.120
They'll warm up.

112
00:04:39.253 --> 00:04:40.553
Just like that caramel
drizzle if you don't let go.


113
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.120
Thank you.

114
00:04:45.253 --> 00:04:47.386
All right, I'm here.

115
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.453
For dessert, tiramisu di Franco.

116
00:04:51.587 --> 00:04:53.987
Caramel drizzle topping,
dusted with cocoa.


117
00:05:00.087 --> 00:05:02.286
I, uh, I just wanted
to thank you again


118
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.320
for making the time to
review our new menu.


119
00:05:04.453 --> 00:05:06.520
I've always had a lot of
respect and admiration


120
00:05:06.653 --> 00:05:08.320
for your column in The Times.

121
00:05:08.453 --> 00:05:09.854
Hmm.

122
00:05:09.987 --> 00:05:12.020
I'm sorry, was that a hmm?

123
00:05:12.153 --> 00:05:13.120
Or a mmm?

124
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.120
It's nothing.

125
00:05:16.253 --> 00:05:18.954
No, but if it was
somethin', you could tell me.


126
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.153
Mr. Rossi, I'm not
really supposed to give


127
00:05:22.286 --> 00:05:24.120
feedback before my
review goes live,


128
00:05:24.253 --> 00:05:26.720
but it's a little dry.

129
00:05:29.587 --> 00:05:31.854
I'm sorry.

130
00:05:31.987 --> 00:05:34.453
Did you just cause my
famously moist tiramisu


131
00:05:34.587 --> 00:05:36.954
a little, uh, dry?

132
00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:38.186
Just a touch.

133
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.286
But that's impossible.

134
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.787
Well, it's certainly possible.

135
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.520
I'm sorry, it's just
never has there been a more


136
00:05:42.653 --> 00:05:45.020
perfect customer fit for
a more perfect dessert.


137
00:05:45.153 --> 00:05:47.120
I'm just, have another bite.

138
00:05:47.253 --> 00:05:48.787
I think I've sampled enough.

139
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.453
You'll find my review
online later this evening.


140
00:05:51.587 --> 00:05:53.386
And it'll be a
good one, right?


141
00:05:57.753 --> 00:06:00.420
Uh, did I mention
how much I appreciate


142
00:06:00.553 --> 00:06:02.353
and admire you and your column?

143
00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:03.687
And she's gone.

144
00:06:06.553 --> 00:06:08.854
Ah, don't worry about it.

145
00:06:08.987 --> 00:06:10.054
Really?

146
00:06:10.186 --> 00:06:12.854
I mean worry
about it a little.


147
00:06:12.987 --> 00:06:15.687
Amy, I'd like you to take
Benjamin under your wing,


148
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.020
help him get acclimated.

149
00:06:17.153 --> 00:06:18.553
As the most senior manager here,

150
00:06:18.687 --> 00:06:20.887
I want him in the
most capable hands.


151
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.520
Well, that's what I
wanted to talk to you about.


152
00:06:23.653 --> 00:06:25.887
I thought my seniority
would've given me


153
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.753
a leg up on that opportunity.

154
00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:29.653
We'll see what
opens up next year.


155
00:06:32.054 --> 00:06:35.753
I made myself a
promise that if I didn't


156
00:06:35.887 --> 00:06:38.587
move up this year,
I would move on,


157
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.153
and I need to keep that promise.

158
00:06:41.286 --> 00:06:42.286
I understand.

159
00:06:43.753 --> 00:06:49.453
You're always welcome back
if you change your mind.


160
00:06:49.587 --> 00:06:50.687
Yup.

161
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:51.753
Mmm-hmm, I feel liberated.

162
00:06:51.887 --> 00:06:52.753
Yes!

163
00:06:52.887 --> 00:06:53.920
I feel free!

164
00:06:54.054 --> 00:06:57.186
- 'Atta girl!
- I feel so scared.


165
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.753
Oh, you were on such a roll.

166
00:06:58.887 --> 00:07:00.987
I don't have
anything lined up.


167
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.753
But this is what
you've been saving for.


168
00:07:02.887 --> 00:07:06.453
Now you can devote all your
time to unlocking your destiny.


169
00:07:06.587 --> 00:07:07.920
Destiny.

170
00:07:08.054 --> 00:07:08.920
All right.

171
00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:10.420
Yeah, there's some confidence.

172
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.253
Is that destiny calling already?

173
00:07:15.054 --> 00:07:15.920
Hello?

174
00:07:16.054 --> 00:07:17.653
Amy Lamay?

175
00:07:17.787 --> 00:07:19.087
David Lewis, attorney.

176
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.653
I know you've been trying
to reach Ms. Tucci.


177
00:07:22.787 --> 00:07:25.954
I'm sorry to inform you that
she recently passed away


178
00:07:26.087 --> 00:07:27.954
and we need you to
come into our offices


179
00:07:28.087 --> 00:07:30.120
for the reading of her will.

180
00:07:30.253 --> 00:07:31.120
How's Friday?

181
00:07:31.253 --> 00:07:33.120
Yeah. Okay.

182
00:07:33.253 --> 00:07:34.653
Friday, I'll be there.

183
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.987
Is everything all right?

184
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.520
Hey, so.

185
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.587
Stop refreshing.

186
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.587
Huh?

187
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.587
I'm not refreshing.

188
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.587
I'm playing solitaire.

189
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.820
Why am I lying to you?

190
00:07:56.954 --> 00:07:57.987
It should be up by now!

191
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.320
So you know, her
rating has nothing to do


192
00:08:00.453 --> 00:08:01.487
with all your hard work.

193
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.487
You're right.

194
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.720
I'm, ah, eh, I'm letting go.

195
00:08:03.854 --> 00:08:04.787
- Let it go!
- I'm keeping cool.


196
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.887
It doesn't even.

197
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:06.887
Whoa, it's up, it's up!

198
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:07.920
- It's up.
- It's up.


199
00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:09.220
Hey, what does it say?

200
00:08:09.353 --> 00:08:11.386
Chef Frank Rossi largely
abandons the restaurant's


201
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.487
original menu in favor of
some new age Italian fusion.


202
00:08:17.353 --> 00:08:18.487
Nice.

203
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.720
That just isn't
quite there yet.


204
00:08:21.854 --> 00:08:22.720
Mmm-mmm.

205
00:08:22.854 --> 00:08:24.386
What's the missing ingredient?

206
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.353
Could be as simple
as a bit more love.


207
00:08:27.487 --> 00:08:28.353
Five forks.

208
00:08:28.487 --> 00:08:30.054
Oh, that's good.

209
00:08:30.186 --> 00:08:31.153
Out of 10 forks.

210
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.386
How do you erase
something from the internet?


211
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.653
What?

212
00:08:34.787 --> 00:08:36.487
No, that'll be in
print later this week.


213
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.220
What effect is it
gonna have on business?


214
00:08:38.353 --> 00:08:39.653
Well, uh, you
know, our client base


215
00:08:39.787 --> 00:08:41.553
is kind of doing
this a little bit,


216
00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:44.653
and Kimberly's articles tend
to make things go like this


217
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.020
or like that.

218
00:08:49.153 --> 00:08:50.153
- Okay.
- Yeah.


219
00:08:50.286 --> 00:08:51.553
Okay, no, it's okay.

220
00:08:51.687 --> 00:08:54.386
I can edit the recipes
for a little more flavor.


221
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.653
Or less.

222
00:08:55.787 --> 00:08:56.720
Or a little more love.

223
00:08:56.854 --> 00:08:58.553
What does that even mean, Sal?

224
00:08:58.687 --> 00:09:00.054
I
-I
-I, you know.

225
00:09:00.253 --> 00:09:02.286
Maybe she's referring
to your demeanor,


226
00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.553
'cause sometimes you can
come across a little brash.


227
00:09:04.687 --> 00:09:05.553
Brash?

228
00:09:05.687 --> 00:09:07.720
Bra, uh, it's passion, Sal.

229
00:09:07.854 --> 00:09:08.720
Okay, I'm Italian.

230
00:09:08.854 --> 00:09:09.753
I can't help it. 
You know this.

231
00:09:09.887 --> 00:09:10.787
Yeah, I do.

232
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.054
Oh, well, maybe this is her

233
00:09:12.186 --> 00:09:13.054
calling to change her mind.

234
00:09:13.186 --> 00:09:14.054
Hello?

235
00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:15.120
Is this Frank Rossi?

236
00:09:15.253 --> 00:09:16.420
Yeah, this is Frank Rossi.

237
00:09:16.553 --> 00:09:17.954
Maria Tucci
passed away recently.


238
00:09:18.087 --> 00:09:18.954
What?

239
00:09:19.087 --> 00:09:19.954
I'm sorry
for your loss.


240
00:09:20.087 --> 00:09:21.120
Wait. What?

241
00:09:21.253 --> 00:09:22.587
I'm her
attorney David Lewis.


242
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.453
We need you to come in
for a reading of her will.


243
00:09:24.587 --> 00:09:25.453
Yeah.

244
00:09:25.587 --> 00:09:26.520
Can you
come in this Friday?


245
00:09:26.653 --> 00:09:27.520
Okay, Friday.

246
00:09:27.653 --> 00:09:28.520
We'll send
you the details.


247
00:09:28.653 --> 00:09:30.620
Thank you.

248
00:09:30.753 --> 00:09:32.620
What is it?

249
00:09:32.753 --> 00:09:33.954
You all right?

250
00:09:34.087 --> 00:09:35.587
I need some air.

251
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.887
Okay.

252
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:37.987
You okay?

253
00:09:40.153 --> 00:09:41.054
Good morning.

254
00:09:41.186 --> 00:09:42.587
Good morning.

255
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.620
Ah, cappuccino with an extra
splash of espresso, please.


256
00:09:44.753 --> 00:09:46.453
Yeah, you got it.

257
00:09:46.587 --> 00:09:48.220
Uh, and a cannoli.

258
00:09:48.353 --> 00:09:50.020
Oh, lucky you.
It's our last one.


259
00:09:50.854 --> 00:09:51.720
I'll take a paper, too.

260
00:09:51.854 --> 00:09:52.820
Sure, thanks.

261
00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.286
- Hey.
- Hey.


262
00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.887
Can I get a cappuccino
with an extra splash


263
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:00.954
of espresso, please?

264
00:10:01.087 --> 00:10:02.286
Oh, and a cannoli.

265
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.054
Unfortunately, we just
gave out our last one.


266
00:10:05.186 --> 00:10:06.220
Ah, okay.

267
00:10:06.353 --> 00:10:07.920
Just the cappuccino
then, please.


268
00:10:08.054 --> 00:10:09.054
Yeah.

269
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.253
Couldn't help but
overhear we ordered


270
00:10:16.386 --> 00:10:17.787
the exact same drink.

271
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.887
Ah, yeah.

272
00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:21.220
Good friend of mine
introduced it to me.


273
00:10:21.353 --> 00:10:23.120
This place, too, actually.

274
00:10:23.253 --> 00:10:24.220
Same here.

275
00:10:35.186 --> 00:10:37.054
Chef Frank.

276
00:10:37.186 --> 00:10:38.054
Or Frank.

277
00:10:38.186 --> 00:10:39.553
I don't know why I said that.

278
00:10:39.687 --> 00:10:41.987
I guess I'm just used to
introducing myself that way.


279
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.253
Amy.

280
00:10:44.386 --> 00:10:45.620
What kind of chef are you?

281
00:10:45.753 --> 00:10:47.720
Oh, uh, Italian.

282
00:10:47.854 --> 00:10:49.220
Kind of renowned, actually.

283
00:10:49.353 --> 00:10:50.720
Renowned, wow.

284
00:10:50.854 --> 00:10:51.920
Ah, just a little.

285
00:10:52.054 --> 00:10:54.286
You know, gotta
stay humble, right?


286
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.887
What line of work
are you in, Amy?


287
00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:57.887
Management.

288
00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:58.887
Oh.

289
00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.487
Lack thereof at the moment.

290
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.320
I'm still trying to figure
out my destino right now.


291
00:11:03.453 --> 00:11:04.520
Ah, I see.

292
00:11:04.653 --> 00:11:05.520
Yeah.

293
00:11:05.653 --> 00:11:07.954
Destino.

294
00:11:13.453 --> 00:11:14.620
Cannoli.

295
00:11:14.753 --> 00:11:16.153
Uh, you're the, you're
the lucky one who got


296
00:11:16.286 --> 00:11:17.487
the last cannoli.

297
00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:18.720
Yeah.

298
00:11:18.854 --> 00:11:20.687
But lucky isn't how I
describe myself lately.


299
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.787
Wanna split it?

300
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.320
I, uh, I already had half.

301
00:11:24.453 --> 00:11:25.320
Right, yeah, of course.

302
00:11:25.453 --> 00:11:26.453
Why would...

303
00:11:28.453 --> 00:11:30.286
Uh, mind if I just take
a look at the paper?


304
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.353
Gotta check the scores.

305
00:11:32.487 --> 00:11:33.353
Which team?

306
00:11:33.487 --> 00:11:34.353
Yankees.

307
00:11:34.487 --> 00:11:35.353
Who else?

308
00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:36.487
It's not baseball season.

309
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.386
That was a joke, Amy.

310
00:11:39.487 --> 00:11:41.153
Not one of my best.

311
00:11:41.286 --> 00:11:42.153
You know what?

312
00:11:42.286 --> 00:11:43.353
I've gotta get going, actually,

313
00:11:43.487 --> 00:11:47.286
so the paper and
cannoli are all yours,


314
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.987
renowned chef Frank.

315
00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.420
You have a nice day.

316
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.687
Well, nice to meet you.

317
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.653
And she's gone.

318
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.887
So who are we waiting for?

319
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.587
Just one more person.

320
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.520
Sorry I'm late.

321
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.587
Uh, weird chef guy?

322
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.820
Last cannoli girl?

323
00:12:14.987 --> 00:12:17.054
What, you think I'm weird?

324
00:12:17.186 --> 00:12:18.353
How did you know Mama?

325
00:12:18.487 --> 00:12:19.854
I'm head chef
at her restaurant.


326
00:12:19.987 --> 00:12:21.753
I've been practically runnin'
the place the last year.


327
00:12:21.887 --> 00:12:23.353
Wait, how do you know her?

328
00:12:23.487 --> 00:12:24.920
We were close.

329
00:12:25.054 --> 00:12:27.353
We hadn't spoken for awhile.

330
00:12:27.487 --> 00:12:29.487
So you two know each other?

331
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.353
- No.
- Yes!


332
00:12:31.487 --> 00:12:32.587
Yeah!

333
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.587
We just met.

334
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.087
Yeah.

335
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.687
Mama wanted you both present
to hear the instructions


336
00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.520
laid out in her will.

337
00:12:39.653 --> 00:12:42.520
Amy, I have the utmost
confidence that you will


338
00:12:42.653 --> 00:12:46.553
dutifully and faithfully
preside over my life's work.


339
00:12:46.687 --> 00:12:48.520
You were like a
granddaughter to me.


340
00:12:48.653 --> 00:12:52.753
So, that's why I'm
leaving you my restaurant.


341
00:12:52.887 --> 00:12:55.353
Mama's is now yours.

342
00:12:55.487 --> 00:12:56.887
What?

343
00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.920
Mama's wish is for Frank
to remain at the restaurant


344
00:12:59.054 --> 00:13:02.320
in his current
capacity as head chef.


345
00:13:02.453 --> 00:13:05.320
There is also a
substantial inheritance,


346
00:13:05.453 --> 00:13:08.453
predicated on Amy
taking ownership.


347
00:13:08.587 --> 00:13:09.453
Oh.

348
00:13:09.587 --> 00:13:11.286
And

349
00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.520
she also left this.

350
00:13:17.887 --> 00:13:18.954
That book.

351
00:13:19.087 --> 00:13:19.954
She never let anyone
else touch this.


352
00:13:20.087 --> 00:13:21.320
Wait, wait, that's it?

353
00:13:21.453 --> 00:13:22.420
No other details?

354
00:13:22.553 --> 00:13:24.620
She's left nothing else.

355
00:13:24.753 --> 00:13:27.753
I'm afraid her intentions are
up to your interpretation.


356
00:13:38.954 --> 00:13:40.420
Good morning.

357
00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:41.987
Good morning.

358
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.020
Boss.

359
00:13:44.186 --> 00:13:45.120
Boss.

360
00:13:45.253 --> 00:13:46.353
Wow.

361
00:13:46.487 --> 00:13:48.153
You know, I had my own
plans for Mama's where


362
00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:49.587
I'd one day take over,

363
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.087
but I suppose that
just wasn't my destino.


364
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.987
Speaking of which,
is that for me?


365
00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.620
Extra splash of
espresso and a cannoli.


366
00:13:58.753 --> 00:13:59.753
Tryin' to butter me up?

367
00:13:59.887 --> 00:14:01.087
It's a peace offering.

368
00:14:01.987 --> 00:14:03.987
Mama was special to both of us,

369
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.553
and she had no other family.

370
00:14:05.687 --> 00:14:07.153
We can make this work.

371
00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:18.487
Enjoy, ladies.

372
00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.487
Hey.

373
00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.753
Ugh, no more fresh gnocci.

374
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.320
No more gnocci.

375
00:14:27.453 --> 00:14:28.987
Amy, I'm slammed in the kitchen.

376
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.487
I can't believe how busy we are.

377
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.820
I need you to help me.

378
00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:32.820
What? No.

379
00:14:32.954 --> 00:14:34.487
Oh, no, I, I'm just the busser.

380
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.353
No, no, there's no just
anything here at Mama's.


381
00:14:37.487 --> 00:14:41.020
Every role is vital to this
restaurant, you know that.


382
00:14:41.153 --> 00:14:42.753
What's the number one rule?

383
00:14:43.987 --> 00:14:45.220
Work at everything you
do with all your heart,


384
00:14:45.353 --> 00:14:46.487
soul, mind and strength.

385
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:47.720
Perfect.

386
00:14:47.854 --> 00:14:49.687
You'll learn the rest
of the rules by my side.


387
00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.820
Right now you're promoted.

388
00:14:51.954 --> 00:14:53.353
Congratulations.

389
00:14:53.487 --> 00:14:54.386
Okay.

390
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.453
There's your first customer.

391
00:14:56.587 --> 00:14:58.186
Smile.

392
00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.353
Benvenuti.

393
00:14:59.487 --> 00:15:00.887
Welcome to Mama's.

394
00:15:08.854 --> 00:15:10.954
What did you do to Mama's?

395
00:15:13.753 --> 00:15:14.887
Sales have dipped.

396
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.386
Tiny dip.

397
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.920
Itty bitty, in technical terms.

398
00:15:18.054 --> 00:15:20.620
No plans, repairs or updates.

399
00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:21.620
I got those plans.

400
00:15:21.753 --> 00:15:23.887
Just right up here.

401
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:24.954
The menu's completely changed.

402
00:15:25.087 --> 00:15:26.087
Where are Mama's dishes?

403
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.720
We're still working
out the kinks.


404
00:15:27.854 --> 00:15:29.286
We just need new, uh-

405
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.720
Everything?

406
00:15:30.854 --> 00:15:33.386
Okay, we're in the
middle of an upgrade, okay?


407
00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.253
Look, things have
been kind of crazy


408
00:15:35.386 --> 00:15:37.753
ever since Mama slowed
down and stepped back


409
00:15:37.887 --> 00:15:39.386
from her duties last year.

410
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.920
Obviously I'm not much
of an interior decorator,


411
00:15:42.054 --> 00:15:44.220
but I do make a mean tiramisu.

412
00:15:44.353 --> 00:15:47.054
All right, I come from
a big corporate franchise,


413
00:15:47.186 --> 00:15:48.620
and I've developed a
system that will help


414
00:15:48.753 --> 00:15:49.887
fix all of these issues.

415
00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.286
And then once Mama's is
back in decent shape,


416
00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:54.620
we can both move on.

417
00:15:54.753 --> 00:15:55.787
Oh, wait.

418
00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.487
So you're not
planning on staying?


419
00:16:00.954 --> 00:16:04.954
Financials, attendance,
scheduling, trust.


420
00:16:05.087 --> 00:16:06.620
The FAST system.

421
00:16:06.753 --> 00:16:07.620
Yeah, I got my own system.

422
00:16:07.753 --> 00:16:08.954
It's called DIY.

423
00:16:09.087 --> 00:16:09.954
Mmm.

424
00:16:10.087 --> 00:16:12.854
DIY hasn't been W
-O
-R
-K-ing.

425
00:16:12.987 --> 00:16:14.353
Yes, acronym
thing's real cute.


426
00:16:14.487 --> 00:16:15.787
Definitely won't
get on my nerves.


427
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.687
What is that?

428
00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.854
Oh, that is Galaxy Blast.

429
00:16:19.987 --> 00:16:22.787
Just the greatest
arcade game of all time.


430
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.020
Wanna play?

431
00:16:24.153 --> 00:16:25.687
Mama's classic
Italian restaurant


432
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.153
now features Galaxy Blast?

433
00:16:28.286 --> 00:16:29.520
Yeah.

434
00:16:29.653 --> 00:16:31.253
Okay, I'm shutting this down.

435
00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:33.954
What?

436
00:16:34.087 --> 00:16:36.186
Mama's needs a total refresh.

437
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.854
But you know, with the
inheritance she left,


438
00:16:38.987 --> 00:16:41.553
I think we can really bring
this place back to life.


439
00:16:43.087 --> 00:16:45.487
You're the boss.

440
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.854
What should we do with this?

441
00:16:46.987 --> 00:16:49.286
I'm not sure if she left
it for you or for me.


442
00:16:51.753 --> 00:16:52.620
You know what?

443
00:16:52.753 --> 00:16:53.753
Uh.

444
00:16:54.987 --> 00:16:57.186
It's all yours.

445
00:17:06.453 --> 00:17:07.653
Ooh, biscotti.

446
00:17:07.787 --> 00:17:09.054
Mmm-hmm.

447
00:17:09.186 --> 00:17:10.553
I figured some Italian
desserts would be a good way


448
00:17:10.687 --> 00:17:11.987
to break the ice
with the employees


449
00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.653
of your Italian restaurant.

450
00:17:15.286 --> 00:17:16.887
My restaurant.

451
00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.687
Nothing daunting
about those words.


452
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.186
It's kind of funny,
though, isn't it?


453
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.720
You just quit your job at Chow,

454
00:17:21.854 --> 00:17:24.320
and then this opportunity
falls right into your lap.


455
00:17:24.453 --> 00:17:25.520
Destino.

456
00:17:25.653 --> 00:17:27.386
Oh, I don't know
about destino.


457
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.320
Why, what do you mean?

458
00:17:29.453 --> 00:17:31.153
I know I should
do what Mama wants.


459
00:17:31.286 --> 00:17:33.353
It's just that I don't know
that I can do her legacy


460
00:17:33.487 --> 00:17:35.487
justice if I stay
long-term, you know?


461
00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.720
She-she put her heart
and soul into that place,


462
00:17:38.854 --> 00:17:43.820
and if I fail at this, then
I, you know, I fail her.


463
00:17:44.787 --> 00:17:46.320
Hey, you won't fail her.

464
00:17:46.453 --> 00:17:48.320
You've never failed
her before, right?


465
00:17:50.854 --> 00:17:52.887
Right.

466
00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.186
So, Frankie,
how you feelin'?


467
00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.987
I think I'm still in
the anger stage of grief.


468
00:17:59.120 --> 00:17:59.987
Miss her.

469
00:18:00.186 --> 00:18:01.286
Yeah, me too.

470
00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.120
It's a lot to take
in all at once.


471
00:18:03.253 --> 00:18:04.553
But you know, we're
gonna get through this.


472
00:18:04.687 --> 00:18:05.553
I know.

473
00:18:05.687 --> 00:18:07.887
You know what's funny?
- What?


474
00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.920
I ran into Amy at
Destino's before we went


475
00:18:10.054 --> 00:18:10.954
to the lawyer.

476
00:18:11.087 --> 00:18:12.220
Uh-huh.

477
00:18:12.353 --> 00:18:13.253
Think she was
flirting with me.


478
00:18:13.386 --> 00:18:14.720
Really?

479
00:18:14.854 --> 00:18:16.120
That's a good thing you
didn't flirt back with her.


480
00:18:16.253 --> 00:18:19.120
That would make things a
little interesting around here.


481
00:18:19.253 --> 00:18:20.787
Yeah, it's...

482
00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:21.787
Oh no.

483
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:22.887
You flirted with her, didn't ya?

484
00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.087
I don't think she noticed.

485
00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.453
I'm about as smooth
as a pine cone.


486
00:18:25.587 --> 00:18:27.054
Plus, we got the stresses
of this situation


487
00:18:27.186 --> 00:18:28.054
distracting us.

488
00:18:28.186 --> 00:18:29.054
Yeah, about that.

489
00:18:29.186 --> 00:18:30.286
What's your plan?

490
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.587
Well, Mama made
one thing clear.


491
00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.386
She wants me to stay.

492
00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.553
Truth is, I don't know if I can.

493
00:18:40.887 --> 00:18:42.887
Hi, everybody. I'm Amy.

494
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.386
I'm the new owner and manager,

495
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.054
and I've brought you biscotti.

496
00:18:47.186 --> 00:18:48.720
My best friend
Christine made them.


497
00:18:48.854 --> 00:18:50.054
Dig in.

498
00:18:50.186 --> 00:18:52.286
I'm sure they'll go
well with the coffee.


499
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.386
Uh, yeah, let's do it after.

500
00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.487
That's fine.

501
00:18:59.687 --> 00:19:01.653
So.

502
00:19:01.787 --> 00:19:04.186
Why don't you tell
me about yourselves?


503
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.753
Okay, I'll kick things off.

504
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.286
Well, I'm Frank.
- Mmm-hmm.


505
00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.320
Head chef.

506
00:19:09.453 --> 00:19:11.653
And the menu is my duty.

507
00:19:11.787 --> 00:19:13.420
And my duty only.

508
00:19:14.587 --> 00:19:15.987
Hey, I'm Sal.

509
00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.787
I've been here for a couple
years helpin' out, you know.


510
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.620
Hostin', servin',
cookin', all that stuff.


511
00:19:20.753 --> 00:19:21.620
Welcome, Amy.

512
00:19:21.753 --> 00:19:22.620
Thank you.

513
00:19:22.753 --> 00:19:23.820
Uh, yeah. Name's Lorenzo.

514
00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:26.987
I'm an old, old
friend of Frank's.


515
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.353
He actually brought
me in here once things


516
00:19:28.487 --> 00:19:29.954
started falling apart and-

517
00:19:30.087 --> 00:19:31.487
Eh.

518
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.653
Just to handle odds and ends.

519
00:19:34.787 --> 00:19:35.653
I'm very handy.

520
00:19:35.787 --> 00:19:37.020
Great.

521
00:19:37.153 --> 00:19:38.487
Listen, everyone.

522
00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:42.320
I know this is a tough
transition for all of us.


523
00:19:42.453 --> 00:19:45.854
We all loved Mama, so, so
let's just try to do this


524
00:19:45.987 --> 00:19:47.687
to honor her memory.

525
00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:51.353
On that note, I
took the liberty.


526
00:19:51.487 --> 00:19:52.620
Can you pass these out?

527
00:19:52.753 --> 00:19:55.353
I've assigned various
tasks to each of you


528
00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:59.020
based on your names.

529
00:19:59.153 --> 00:20:00.286
Fun, right?

530
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.820
Yeah, that's
one way to put it.


531
00:20:01.954 --> 00:20:05.020
Mama's inheritance will
cover a one-month refresh,


532
00:20:05.153 --> 00:20:07.020
and during that time
we'll experiment


533
00:20:07.153 --> 00:20:08.553
with a soft open,

534
00:20:08.687 --> 00:20:12.987
and we will culminate in a
grand reopening celebration.


535
00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.120
It's gonna be big.

536
00:20:15.253 --> 00:20:16.954
Go team!

537
00:20:17.087 --> 00:20:18.687
- All right.
- Okay.


538
00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.286
And don't forget the biscotti.

539
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.987
It's really good.

540
00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.186
Nice to meet you.

541
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.186
Biscotti?

542
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.286
I'm good.

543
00:20:32.487 --> 00:20:33.620
Don't worry about them.

544
00:20:33.753 --> 00:20:35.353
They'll come around.

545
00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.820
Your ragu was Papa's favorite.

546
00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:59.954
He always said the
key to the perfect sauce


547
00:21:00.087 --> 00:21:04.653
is to go easy on the seasoning
and heavy on the confidence.


548
00:21:06.487 --> 00:21:09.520
Roberto, come try my ragu.

549
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.920
Perfecto.

550
00:21:17.054 --> 00:21:21.520
And now try

551
00:21:24.653 --> 00:21:26.687
And now try this.

552
00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.386
I'm still full from taste
testing your carbonara


553
00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.386
an hour ago.

554
00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.587
What's the worry?

555
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.920
This is a lot of pressure.

556
00:21:33.054 --> 00:21:35.020
The First Generation
Food Festival is known


557
00:21:35.153 --> 00:21:36.253
to launch careers.

558
00:21:36.386 --> 00:21:38.353
Emilio entered last
year and now look.


559
00:21:38.487 --> 00:21:40.087
Emilio's on Broadway.

560
00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.420
You have faith in
your cooking, yeah?


561
00:21:42.553 --> 00:21:43.687
Of course.

562
00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.920
Then it will all
work out as it should.


563
00:21:46.054 --> 00:21:47.520
Destino.

564
00:21:47.653 --> 00:21:50.253
Whether it's today
or years from now,


565
00:21:50.386 --> 00:21:52.186
you will open your
dream restaurant.


566
00:21:53.353 --> 00:21:54.753
Now why are you rushing around?

567
00:21:54.887 --> 00:21:56.186
We've got plenty of time.

568
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.186
Come with me.

569
00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.320
I have a surprise for you.

570
00:22:06.054 --> 00:22:07.753
This festival is important,

571
00:22:07.887 --> 00:22:10.553
but not more important than
making time for family.


572
00:22:12.553 --> 00:22:14.253
Masseto.

573
00:22:14.386 --> 00:22:15.753
But we can't afford-

574
00:22:15.887 --> 00:22:18.253
I sold a few lasagnas
in Brooklyn last weekend.


575
00:22:18.386 --> 00:22:20.153
I really like it there.

576
00:22:23.587 --> 00:22:25.553
Tell me, what are you seeing?

577
00:22:27.054 --> 00:22:29.087
The Manhattan skyline.

578
00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.653
Mmm.

579
00:22:30.787 --> 00:22:33.353
The view from a
quaint, brick building.


580
00:22:36.453 --> 00:22:37.987
My restaurant.

581
00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.320
Mama's.

582
00:22:43.887 --> 00:22:49.820
One day I will
give you that view.


583
00:22:49.954 --> 00:22:50.987
To Mama's.

584
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.286
To Mama's.

585
00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.753
Frank.

586
00:22:55.887 --> 00:22:57.753
Look, look at this.

587
00:22:57.887 --> 00:23:00.487
Papa's sacrifices are
ultimately what led


588
00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.987
to the success of my
famous ragu sauce.


589
00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.820
Each recipe has a memory,

590
00:23:05.954 --> 00:23:08.553
and there's photos and stories.

591
00:23:08.687 --> 00:23:11.186
And nothing super helpful
for our immediate situation?


592
00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.386
Well, not necessarily.

593
00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.820
What if the key to
refreshing this place


594
00:23:14.954 --> 00:23:17.820
is to go back to the
beginning and replicate


595
00:23:17.954 --> 00:23:20.054
the original look
and feel of Mama's?


596
00:23:20.186 --> 00:23:21.153
Okay.

597
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.153
Listen, I know it must feel
like I'm just coming in here


598
00:23:25.286 --> 00:23:26.553
to change everything.

599
00:23:26.687 --> 00:23:28.386
Remember, this is for Mama.

600
00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.386
Think of it as a reboot.

601
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.553
Everybody loves a reboot.

602
00:23:30.687 --> 00:23:31.820
Do they?

603
00:23:31.954 --> 00:23:32.820
Mmm.

604
00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:34.153
I'm gonna need
you to trust me.


605
00:23:34.286 --> 00:23:36.320
Does
that go both ways?


606
00:23:36.453 --> 00:23:37.320
Of course.

607
00:23:37.453 --> 00:23:39.020
So you trust me with the menu?

608
00:23:39.153 --> 00:23:40.220
Uh.

609
00:23:40.353 --> 00:23:41.487
You have nothing
to worry about.


610
00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:42.687
Why does
that worry me more?


611
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.553
Okay, let me catch
you up with the evolved


612
00:23:44.687 --> 00:23:45.820
flavor of Mama's, huh?

613
00:23:45.954 --> 00:23:47.186
Can I get rid of
the pinball machine?


614
00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.653
Absolutely not, no.

615
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.220
I will think about it.

616
00:23:51.353 --> 00:23:55.320
Well, then, I will
give you a chance.


617
00:23:55.453 --> 00:23:57.353
Catch me up on the
evolved flavor of Mama's.


618
00:23:57.487 --> 00:23:58.653
All right, okay.

619
00:24:05.087 --> 00:24:06.453
Hey, sorry I'm late.

620
00:24:06.587 --> 00:24:08.220
We still have time
to catch that movie.


621
00:24:08.353 --> 00:24:09.620
How was day one?

622
00:24:09.753 --> 00:24:12.920
When I quit my job for
more of the challenge,


623
00:24:13.054 --> 00:24:15.386
I think I wanted something
a little less challenging.


624
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.553
Is this about Frank?

625
00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.954
Yeah.

626
00:24:20.087 --> 00:24:21.887
But also about Mama.

627
00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.120
Mmm.

628
00:24:23.253 --> 00:24:24.620
You know how I said
I never failed her?


629
00:24:24.753 --> 00:24:25.720
Yeah.

630
00:24:25.854 --> 00:24:28.887
Well, we had a big falling out

631
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.220
after I left all
those years ago,


632
00:24:30.353 --> 00:24:33.054
and we hadn't spoken since.

633
00:24:36.186 --> 00:24:39.054
So why would she leave
me her restaurant?


634
00:24:50.386 --> 00:24:51.587
Looking good, Emily.

635
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.820
This place is sparkling clean.

636
00:24:53.954 --> 00:24:55.120
Maybe a bit too sparkling.

637
00:24:55.253 --> 00:24:56.620
Go easy on yourself.

638
00:24:56.753 --> 00:24:57.653
How's it goin' up here, Lorenzo?

639
00:24:57.787 --> 00:24:58.920
Doin' fine.

640
00:24:59.054 --> 00:25:01.687
Amy, these chandeliers
are a little dim.


641
00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.353
Are you sure that's what
Mama's used to look like?


642
00:25:03.487 --> 00:25:04.487
Yeah.

643
00:25:05.587 --> 00:25:06.487
No.

644
00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:07.487
Maybe a touch dimmer.

645
00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:08.520
Dimmer?

646
00:25:08.653 --> 00:25:10.520
Oh, perfect.

647
00:25:10.653 --> 00:25:11.820
Almost.

648
00:25:11.954 --> 00:25:13.054
Huh.

649
00:25:13.186 --> 00:25:14.087
You want me to add
a touch of white?


650
00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.020
Break it up a bit?

651
00:25:16.153 --> 00:25:17.054
Yes!

652
00:25:17.186 --> 00:25:18.220
Okay.

653
00:25:18.353 --> 00:25:19.320
Great idea.

654
00:25:21.687 --> 00:25:23.553
Hate to interrupt Space Blast.

655
00:25:23.687 --> 00:25:25.153
Galaxy Blast.

656
00:25:25.286 --> 00:25:26.720
Oh! Oh! Oh!

657
00:25:26.854 --> 00:25:27.987
Why?

658
00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.720
I was just about to
beat Sal's high score.


659
00:25:29.854 --> 00:25:32.220
Well, I'm gonna
be frank with you.


660
00:25:32.353 --> 00:25:33.320
I haven't heard
that one before.


661
00:25:33.453 --> 00:25:34.420
I need your help.

662
00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.186
Help me recreate
Mama's classics.


663
00:25:38.353 --> 00:25:39.386
Come on.

664
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.386
I'm still gonna give
you a chance to show me


665
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.920
your version of the menu.

666
00:25:42.054 --> 00:25:45.153
Why is recreating the original
Mama's so important to you?


667
00:25:45.286 --> 00:25:48.854
Why are you so opposed to
bringing back the classics?


668
00:25:48.987 --> 00:25:51.054
Okay, I will think about it.

669
00:25:51.186 --> 00:25:52.653
Okay, great.

670
00:25:52.787 --> 00:25:54.020
Thank you.

671
00:25:54.153 --> 00:25:55.153
When are we sampling?

672
00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.487
Oh, uh, yeah.

673
00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.653
Meet me in the dining room
in two hours for dinner.


674
00:25:59.787 --> 00:26:00.920
Okay.

675
00:26:01.054 --> 00:26:02.220
And bring an appetite.

676
00:26:08.854 --> 00:26:11.120
You don't hurry up, dinner's
gonna become breakfast.


677
00:26:11.253 --> 00:26:13.353
Okay, you really
shouldn't rush the chef.


678
00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:19.653
Here is your complete
sampling of Mama's new menu.


679
00:26:23.353 --> 00:26:24.787
Where do you wanna start?

680
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.987
What's that one?

681
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.920
Ah, these are roast
branzino with tomatoes,


682
00:26:28.054 --> 00:26:29.820
potatoes, and olives.

683
00:26:31.186 --> 00:26:32.186
You know what it's not?

684
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.186
What?

685
00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.320
Mama's penne.

686
00:26:35.353 --> 00:26:36.253
I know.

687
00:26:36.386 --> 00:26:37.286
That's Mama's right here.

688
00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:38.753
Oh.

689
00:26:38.887 --> 00:26:40.420
Great!

690
00:26:40.553 --> 00:26:42.720
Here we go.

691
00:26:46.253 --> 00:26:48.720
It's hot.

692
00:26:48.854 --> 00:26:50.720
Not very adventurous, are ya?

693
00:26:50.854 --> 00:26:51.954
Adventurous?

694
00:26:52.087 --> 00:26:53.286
Not when it comes
to habanero penne.


695
00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.720
It's habiata.

696
00:26:54.854 --> 00:26:56.753
Look, the menu's sort
of become a fusion.


697
00:26:56.887 --> 00:26:59.054
It's Mama's classics
with a little more edge.


698
00:26:59.186 --> 00:27:01.186
Old and the new,
come together as one.


699
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.054
And how did you
end up at Mama's?


700
00:27:04.987 --> 00:27:06.787
Ah, eh, Lorenzo!

701
00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.020
Tiramisu?

702
00:27:08.153 --> 00:27:09.286
Comin'
right up, Frankie!


703
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.320
You're deflecting.

704
00:27:10.453 --> 00:27:11.520
I'm not deflecting.

705
00:27:11.653 --> 00:27:12.520
You are. There's
a story there.


706
00:27:12.653 --> 00:27:13.520
I'd like to hear it.
- No story.


707
00:27:13.653 --> 00:27:14.520
I applied, she hired me.

708
00:27:14.653 --> 00:27:15.620
That's the end of it.

709
00:27:15.753 --> 00:27:16.954
Ah. Here, perfect.

710
00:27:18.253 --> 00:27:19.120
Try some, go ahead.

711
00:27:19.253 --> 00:27:20.120
Thanks.

712
00:27:20.253 --> 00:27:21.286
You got it, boss.

713
00:27:23.587 --> 00:27:28.854
You know, I'm more
of a cannoli girl.


714
00:27:28.987 --> 00:27:30.987
Are you a picky eater?

715
00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.453
No.

716
00:27:32.587 --> 00:27:34.453
Oh my gosh, no wonder
you're so opposed to my menu.


717
00:27:34.587 --> 00:27:36.353
Your tastes are less
branzino habiata,


718
00:27:36.487 --> 00:27:38.820
more chicken nuggets,
mac and cheese.


719
00:27:38.954 --> 00:27:40.453
Who doesn't love chicken
nuggets and mac and cheese?


720
00:27:40.587 --> 00:27:42.120
Oh, we could sample
the kid's menu instead.


721
00:27:42.253 --> 00:27:43.653
Okay, now you're
being obnoxious.


722
00:27:43.787 --> 00:27:46.787
I will try your famous
tiramisu one day.


723
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.954
Well, I'm gonna
hold you to that.


724
00:27:48.087 --> 00:27:49.087
Great.

725
00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:51.987
Now that I've sampled
some of Frank's fusion,


726
00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.887
how about you try
something for me?


727
00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.520
Can I get Mama's Flight?

728
00:28:02.653 --> 00:28:03.854
- You got it.
- Thank you.


729
00:28:03.987 --> 00:28:05.186
Mama's Flight?

730
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.186
Yeah.

731
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.420
All Mama's favorite wines.

732
00:28:07.553 --> 00:28:09.186
I'm surprised you didn't
know about this place.


733
00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.420
Nice place.

734
00:28:11.553 --> 00:28:13.854
Thanks.

735
00:28:13.987 --> 00:28:15.753
Chianti.

736
00:28:15.887 --> 00:28:20.553
Light, fruity.

737
00:28:20.687 --> 00:28:22.253
It's comforting.

738
00:28:22.386 --> 00:28:23.753
Well, this was
our drink of choice


739
00:28:23.887 --> 00:28:26.854
whenever we'd have long
talks about life and love.


740
00:28:26.987 --> 00:28:29.186
And this

741
00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:35.353
is a Meroni.

742
00:28:37.054 --> 00:28:38.420
Mmm.

743
00:28:38.553 --> 00:28:39.720
Bold.

744
00:28:39.854 --> 00:28:41.054
Yeah, well that's why
Mama associated that one


745
00:28:41.186 --> 00:28:44.020
with the rush of
taking risks in life.


746
00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.520
Is that one familiar at all?

747
00:28:52.987 --> 00:28:54.420
It's Masseto.

748
00:28:54.553 --> 00:28:55.553
Mama and Papa's favorite.

749
00:28:55.687 --> 00:28:57.420
Exactly.

750
00:28:57.553 --> 00:29:00.286
I checked the stock room.

751
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.120
Why aren't we carrying any
of Mama's favorite wines?


752
00:29:02.253 --> 00:29:03.653
Oh, we had to scale back.

753
00:29:03.787 --> 00:29:05.653
I mean, as our customer base
slowed, so did our demand.


754
00:29:05.787 --> 00:29:07.420
Sure, but as you
lose the staples,


755
00:29:07.553 --> 00:29:08.987
you lose Mama's memory.

756
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.920
I mean, you don't want people
to forget about her, do you?


757
00:29:12.054 --> 00:29:13.653
No.

758
00:29:13.787 --> 00:29:15.186
No, no, of course not.

759
00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.320
Hey, well, that's why we
need to go back to the basics.


760
00:29:18.453 --> 00:29:20.054
We need more Mama, not less.

761
00:29:22.954 --> 00:29:26.153
So does this, uh, this
new reboot idea of yours


762
00:29:26.286 --> 00:29:28.153
mean you're stickin' around?

763
00:29:28.286 --> 00:29:29.753
I, uh.

764
00:29:29.887 --> 00:29:31.120
Maybe.

765
00:29:31.253 --> 00:29:34.420
Could be a way for me to
make things right again.


766
00:29:34.553 --> 00:29:35.520
Make things right?

767
00:29:36.386 --> 00:29:37.920
Yeah.

768
00:29:38.054 --> 00:29:39.587
Aesthetically, you know?

769
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.753
Yeah.

770
00:29:40.887 --> 00:29:41.987
You ready for one more stop?

771
00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.087
Do I have a choice?

772
00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:44.320
Drink up.

773
00:29:44.453 --> 00:29:45.687
The Masseto's expensive.

774
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.753
You're awfully quiet
all the way here.


775
00:29:50.887 --> 00:29:52.420
Didn't wanna make
any sudden moves.


776
00:29:52.553 --> 00:29:54.753
Your tastes may be
safe, but your driving?


777
00:29:54.887 --> 00:29:56.487
Ha! Another story.

778
00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.753
I was so far from that
man when I parallel parked.


779
00:30:00.887 --> 00:30:02.987
Yeah, keep telling
yourself that.


780
00:30:04.386 --> 00:30:05.653
There it is.

781
00:30:05.787 --> 00:30:07.987
Mama and Papa's first
apartment here in the States.


782
00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.753
That's where she dreamed
of making her mark


783
00:30:09.887 --> 00:30:13.120
on the culinary world and
then accomplished so much.


784
00:30:13.253 --> 00:30:14.854
There's so much history there.

785
00:30:16.253 --> 00:30:20.587
Seasons change,
history remains, huh?


786
00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.487
Poetic.

787
00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:30.753
I wanted to show
you something, look.


788
00:30:30.887 --> 00:30:32.487
1972.

789
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.820
Ah.

790
00:30:33.954 --> 00:30:37.487
Mama's opened exactly

791
00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.787
What better way to honor
her memory than to reopen


792
00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.820
on the 50th anniversary?

793
00:30:41.954 --> 00:30:42.820
The 15th?

794
00:30:42.954 --> 00:30:43.920
Yeah.

795
00:30:44.054 --> 00:30:45.220
That's two weeks away.

796
00:30:46.453 --> 00:30:48.286
What happened to our
one month timeline?


797
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.787
We'll, we'll just
expedite the schedule


798
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.753
so the reopening coincides
with the anniversary.


799
00:30:52.887 --> 00:30:54.820
It will be a lot of
work, but we can do it.


800
00:30:54.954 --> 00:30:56.253
Mama will be our guide.

801
00:30:56.386 --> 00:30:58.120
Seems overly ambitious,
don't ya think?


802
00:31:00.054 --> 00:31:01.320
Oh, gotta take this.

803
00:31:01.453 --> 00:31:02.487
Excuse me.

804
00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:03.487
This is Frank.

805
00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.153
Hey, Frank, how you doin'?

806
00:31:05.286 --> 00:31:07.987
It's Wallace here over
at Reggio's on 52nd.


807
00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.553
You may have heard that
we're getting ready


808
00:31:09.687 --> 00:31:11.487
to open in a couple of weeks.

809
00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.587
Listen, I heard that you are
on the hunt for a new gig.


810
00:31:15.787 --> 00:31:18.386
I have an opening for you.

811
00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.020
Yeah, talk to me.

812
00:31:28.787 --> 00:31:30.220
Ah, we're reopening
in two weeks.


813
00:31:30.353 --> 00:31:31.520
Two weeks?

814
00:31:31.653 --> 00:31:33.153
That's fast.

815
00:31:33.286 --> 00:31:34.153
You worried?

816
00:31:34.286 --> 00:31:35.420
Was. Not anymore.

817
00:31:37.186 --> 00:31:38.386
Got an interview.

818
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.520
Interview what?

819
00:31:39.653 --> 00:31:40.553
At Reggio's.

820
00:31:40.687 --> 00:31:42.054
Looking for a new head chef.

821
00:31:42.186 --> 00:31:43.820
If all goes according
to plan, uh,


822
00:31:44.787 --> 00:31:45.854
think I'm leavin' Mama's.

823
00:31:45.987 --> 00:31:47.153
What do you mean
you're leaving Mama's?


824
00:31:47.286 --> 00:31:48.386
Shh, shh, shh.

825
00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.553
Look, you know I wanna
do my own thing, right?


826
00:31:49.687 --> 00:31:50.620
Doesn't look like I can
do that here anymore.


827
00:31:50.753 --> 00:31:51.854
- You can't.
- Just-


828
00:31:51.987 --> 00:31:53.320
Gather around, everyone!

829
00:31:53.453 --> 00:31:54.820
Talk later.

830
00:31:57.954 --> 00:31:59.987
All right.

831
00:32:00.186 --> 00:32:03.553
Our timeline just got
a little bit tighter.


832
00:32:03.687 --> 00:32:05.720
The 50th anniversary of
Mama's is in two weeks,


833
00:32:05.854 --> 00:32:08.253
and we're aiming
to be open by then.


834
00:32:08.386 --> 00:32:11.054
I even took out an ad in
The Times to celebrate.


835
00:32:11.186 --> 00:32:14.386
And, to lighten your load,
I'm gonna bring in more crew.


836
00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.620
Sound good?

837
00:32:15.753 --> 00:32:19.386
Uh, good is not the
word for it.


838
00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.920
Oops, didn't think
you could hear me.


839
00:32:21.054 --> 00:32:24.420
Was hoping you'd be more
of a team player, Frank?


840
00:32:24.553 --> 00:32:25.887
Loyal associate.

841
00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.220
Amy, we're a family
here at Mama's, okay?


842
00:32:28.353 --> 00:32:29.987
Not corporate employees.

843
00:32:31.987 --> 00:32:32.887
Hmm.

844
00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:33.987
No, you're right.

845
00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.920
Well.

846
00:32:37.054 --> 00:32:37.954
On what?

847
00:32:38.087 --> 00:32:39.286
You're right.

848
00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:40.620
We're a family.

849
00:32:40.753 --> 00:32:41.920
Absolutely.

850
00:32:42.054 --> 00:32:43.120
Yeah.

851
00:32:43.253 --> 00:32:45.120
I'd also like
us to be friends.


852
00:32:45.253 --> 00:32:46.787
Well, you wanna be my friend?

853
00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.720
I propose a compromise.

854
00:32:48.854 --> 00:32:50.920
We'll carry the
old with the new.


855
00:32:51.054 --> 00:32:53.220
Some of Mama's recipes
and some of yours.


856
00:32:53.353 --> 00:32:54.720
Mama did love a compromise.

857
00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.954
Okay, yeah, we can be friends.

858
00:33:00.087 --> 00:33:02.353
All right, so then
how about you brush up


859
00:33:02.487 --> 00:33:05.054
on Mama's recipes and
I'll go handle the hiring?


860
00:33:07.653 --> 00:33:10.186
Menu is your territory, right?

861
00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.487
Yeah, right.

862
00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:12.487
Right.

863
00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:13.687
Okay, all right.

864
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.120
Let's all go home
and get some sleep.


865
00:33:15.253 --> 00:33:17.787
We'll come back tomorrow
rested and ready to go.


866
00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.453
We can do this!

867
00:33:19.587 --> 00:33:25.854
Yeah!

868
00:33:25.987 --> 00:33:27.720
all around the restaurant.

869
00:33:27.854 --> 00:33:29.720
These are rich with
history, so let's put them


870
00:33:29.854 --> 00:33:31.054
back up where they belong.

871
00:33:31.186 --> 00:33:34.887
There's some of Mama,
Italy, Papa, of course.


872
00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.553
Recapture the spirit of Mama's.

873
00:33:43.453 --> 00:33:45.153
Here at Mama's we are
lookin' for somebody


874
00:33:45.286 --> 00:33:48.020
who is enthusiastic
and hardworking.


875
00:33:48.153 --> 00:33:49.020
Responsible.

876
00:33:49.153 --> 00:33:50.020
Punctual.

877
00:33:50.153 --> 00:33:51.386
Tenacious.

878
00:33:56.353 --> 00:33:59.054
Someone who is excited
to come to work everyday.


879
00:33:59.186 --> 00:34:01.720
Someone who wants to
be part of our family,


880
00:34:01.854 --> 00:34:03.453
because here at Mama's
it's not just the food,


881
00:34:03.587 --> 00:34:05.954
it's the people who make
this place so special.


882
00:34:06.087 --> 00:34:07.920
Now I know you already
have another job,


883
00:34:08.054 --> 00:34:10.220
but the qualifications
are impeccable,


884
00:34:10.353 --> 00:34:12.054
your years of
experience impressive,


885
00:34:12.186 --> 00:34:14.120
and your baked goods
are out of this world,


886
00:34:14.253 --> 00:34:15.854
so if you're looking
for some extra hours,


887
00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:16.887
I'd love to bring you on.

888
00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.220
What do you say?

889
00:34:18.353 --> 00:34:19.553
I say sign me up.

890
00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:22.386
I'm so glad we're gonna
be working together again.


891
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.253
Oh, I'm so happy you
offer such a generous


892
00:34:24.386 --> 00:34:25.487
employee discount!

893
00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.386
Okay!

894
00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.286
Okay, no, I'm happy to
work together with you.


895
00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:29.320
Okay.

896
00:34:31.887 --> 00:34:35.054
Didn't realize there was
a tornado in the forecast.


897
00:34:37.186 --> 00:34:38.720
I'm a little rusty
on Mama's old recipes.


898
00:34:38.854 --> 00:34:40.220
Feeling any less rusty?

899
00:34:40.353 --> 00:34:41.220
Eh.

900
00:34:41.353 --> 00:34:42.787
When's the last time you ate?

901
00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.353
Why do you ask?

902
00:34:46.587 --> 00:34:47.954
Come in!

903
00:34:48.087 --> 00:34:49.920
Hope this pairs well
with whatever takeout


904
00:34:50.054 --> 00:34:51.386
you're ordering for us tonight.

905
00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.587
What are you doing?

906
00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:53.887
I'm not ordering takeout.

907
00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.920
I'm gonna make you a
spaghetti di Maria.


908
00:34:56.054 --> 00:34:57.286
Oh, really?

909
00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:58.553
Okay.

910
00:34:58.687 --> 00:35:00.787
Having said that, I'm
not really a good chef,


911
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.453
hence my landing on the
management side.


912
00:35:03.587 --> 00:35:04.854
You're like Papa.

913
00:35:04.987 --> 00:35:06.553
I guess that
makes you like Mama.


914
00:35:11.153 --> 00:35:14.020
So I may need some of your
chef skills to


915
00:35:14.153 --> 00:35:16.120
fill in any knowledge
gaps I might have.


916
00:35:16.253 --> 00:35:17.787
I doubt you'll need
any help from me.


917
00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.787
Well, you know.

918
00:35:20.787 --> 00:35:22.854
On second thought,

919
00:35:22.987 --> 00:35:24.453
what could it hurt?

920
00:35:24.587 --> 00:35:25.854
Hmm.

921
00:35:25.987 --> 00:35:28.520
Use Parmesan instead of...

922
00:35:28.653 --> 00:35:29.520
You're doing great.

923
00:35:29.653 --> 00:35:31.020
- Am I?
- Doing great.


924
00:35:31.153 --> 00:35:32.186
This is hard work.

925
00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.453
Not, not too much.

926
00:35:33.587 --> 00:35:34.787
It's fun, though, right?

927
00:35:38.087 --> 00:35:39.854
There you go.

928
00:35:41.987 --> 00:35:42.954
See? Simple.

929
00:35:46.653 --> 00:35:47.687
Mmm.

930
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.120
I forgot how delicious that was.

931
00:35:50.253 --> 00:35:51.787
Isn't kind of hard
not to think about her


932
00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.587
when making her specialties?

933
00:35:56.487 --> 00:36:01.353
It's been the toughest
part for me, yeah.


934
00:36:01.487 --> 00:36:03.253
When was the last
time you two spoke?


935
00:36:03.386 --> 00:36:05.353
Oh, we checked in here and
there over the past few months,


936
00:36:05.487 --> 00:36:09.020
but the last thing I said
to her in person was,


937
00:36:11.054 --> 00:36:12.587
"Don't eat too much gnocci."

938
00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.954
What about you?

939
00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.720
It's, uh.

940
00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:24.753
Hey, Emily. What's up?

941
00:36:24.887 --> 00:36:25.753
Oh, hey.

942
00:36:25.887 --> 00:36:27.587
Um, not much.

943
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.920
Just a little problem.

944
00:36:30.054 --> 00:36:31.920
Big problem!

945
00:36:32.054 --> 00:36:35.186
Sorry, did Lorenzo
just say big problem?


946
00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.253
What's goin' on?

947
00:36:36.386 --> 00:36:37.253
I don't know.

948
00:36:37.386 --> 00:36:38.553
Ah, nothing, Frank.

949
00:36:38.687 --> 00:36:39.753
It's this stove, we're
trying to fire it up.


950
00:36:39.887 --> 00:36:41.420
Frank, the thing is kaput.

951
00:36:41.553 --> 00:36:42.687
It's not, eh.

952
00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.887
You could be a little
more tactful, you know?


953
00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.087
What, there's no
use dancin' around it.


954
00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:46.520
Well, you could dance
a little around it.


955
00:36:46.653 --> 00:36:47.520
It's fine, Frank.

956
00:36:47.653 --> 00:36:48.954
We're almost there.

957
00:36:49.087 --> 00:36:50.520
That stove has been in
desperate need of a tuneup.


958
00:36:50.653 --> 00:36:51.587
We just hadn't
gotten around to it.


959
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.587
It's this thing right
here, I'm telling you, yeah.


960
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.520
The soft open is in two days.

961
00:36:56.653 --> 00:36:57.954
Can we fix it before then?

962
00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.920
Uh...

963
00:37:02.054 --> 00:37:03.153
All right.

964
00:37:03.286 --> 00:37:04.320
Lift this up.
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.


965
00:37:04.453 --> 00:37:05.320
Just gonna lean
over a little bit.


966
00:37:05.453 --> 00:37:06.653
Okay, go ahead.

967
00:37:06.787 --> 00:37:07.987
- Oh, I got it.
- Nice.


968
00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.420
I think I got it.

969
00:37:09.553 --> 00:37:10.987
I don't got it.

970
00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.753
Hmm.

971
00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.087
Hmm.

972
00:37:21.753 --> 00:37:24.620
I paired my
gnocci with my ragu sauce


973
00:37:24.753 --> 00:37:26.620
for the food festival.

974
00:37:26.753 --> 00:37:29.620
It fit together
like me and Papa.


975
00:37:29.753 --> 00:37:31.553
The perfect match.

976
00:37:33.753 --> 00:37:37.954
Hey, Frank,
you gotta try the pizza!


977
00:37:38.087 --> 00:37:39.087
Gnocci ragu.

978
00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.253
Extra for you.

979
00:37:40.386 --> 00:37:41.353
Thank you.

980
00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:46.820
Mmm.

981
00:37:46.954 --> 00:37:48.386
You two make quite the team.

982
00:37:49.553 --> 00:37:50.520
Jacob.

983
00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.253
I'm an accountant
and also an investor.


984
00:37:54.386 --> 00:37:55.753
Come by for a
business consultation.


985
00:37:55.887 --> 00:37:59.286
I think I may be able to
help you expand Mama's.


986
00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.087
Here's my fee, 
I marked it down.

987
00:38:03.453 --> 00:38:06.353
That's very kind of you,
but I'm afraid we still


988
00:38:06.487 --> 00:38:07.653
can't afford this.

989
00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.887
I'm also looking for a
little help around the office.


990
00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.054
Errands, paperwork.

991
00:38:16.186 --> 00:38:18.054
Gopher-type tasks.

992
00:38:18.186 --> 00:38:19.653
Maybe we could work out a deal.

993
00:38:22.153 --> 00:38:23.220
I'll do it.

994
00:38:23.353 --> 00:38:25.054
Roberto, but you
already have a job.


995
00:38:25.186 --> 00:38:26.353
I can work nights.

996
00:38:26.487 --> 00:38:28.587
And maybe I'll pick up
some budgeting tips.


997
00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:32.887
I believe in you.

998
00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:34.520
When can I start?

999
00:38:34.653 --> 00:38:36.887
I think you just did.

1000
00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.553
Ah, what Papa
proved is hard work


1001
00:38:39.687 --> 00:38:41.887
and opportunity
can come together


1002
00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:46.820
and create a beautiful recipe
that we called good fortune.


1003
00:38:46.954 --> 00:38:48.820
Well, I did what I could.

1004
00:38:50.353 --> 00:38:51.820
Needs a new spark module.

1005
00:38:51.954 --> 00:38:54.720
Without that, the oven is
just a giant paperweight.


1006
00:38:54.854 --> 00:38:56.820
So we'll order a new part.

1007
00:38:56.954 --> 00:38:57.820
It's just a small hiccup.

1008
00:38:57.954 --> 00:38:59.353
Well, good luck finding one.

1009
00:38:59.487 --> 00:39:00.887
This thing's from the '60s.

1010
00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.920
I don't even know if they
make replacement parts


1011
00:39:03.054 --> 00:39:04.153
for it anymore.

1012
00:39:04.286 --> 00:39:06.286
Okay, so it's a bad
case of the hiccups,


1013
00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.153
but we'll just dig
in and work harder.


1014
00:39:10.353 --> 00:39:12.753
We could just get
a brand-new stove.


1015
00:39:12.887 --> 00:39:14.286
It's just a part, Frank.

1016
00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.887
There's no need to replace
Mama's original stove


1017
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.620
for one part.

1018
00:39:18.753 --> 00:39:20.720
If we find it, can you fix it?

1019
00:39:20.854 --> 00:39:22.220
Yes, ma'am.

1020
00:39:23.887 --> 00:39:24.954
Yeah, all right.

1021
00:39:25.087 --> 00:39:27.054
I'll, I'll, I'll
help you find it.


1022
00:39:27.186 --> 00:39:28.054
Great.

1023
00:39:28.186 --> 00:39:29.453
Thank you.

1024
00:39:29.587 --> 00:39:31.520
We'll scour the city
first thing tomorrow.


1025
00:39:35.587 --> 00:39:37.120
Didn't put up much of a fight.

1026
00:39:37.253 --> 00:39:38.386
Huh?

1027
00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.220
Who is this softy
and what has he done


1028
00:39:40.353 --> 00:39:42.453
with the bold as brass
Frank Rossi, huh?


1029
00:39:42.587 --> 00:39:43.887
I was being a team player.

1030
00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:44.920
Oh, is that what it was?

1031
00:39:45.054 --> 00:39:46.153
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.


1032
00:39:46.286 --> 00:39:49.120
Plus, you know, this
soft open is a great way


1033
00:39:49.253 --> 00:39:51.286
to get my menu out before
I take it elsewhere.


1034
00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.553
Mmm, mmm, yeah, no.

1035
00:39:53.687 --> 00:39:54.887
No, that's not what it is.

1036
00:39:58.553 --> 00:39:59.987
Could it be?

1037
00:40:02.253 --> 00:40:03.120
Nah.

1038
00:40:03.253 --> 00:40:04.386
Nah is right.

1039
00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.553
Mmm-hmm.

1040
00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.120
No.

1041
00:40:09.253 --> 00:40:10.620
Okay.
- Uh-huh.


1042
00:40:10.753 --> 00:40:11.620
Frank.
- Yeah?


1043
00:40:11.753 --> 00:40:12.653
Kitchen's that way.

1044
00:40:12.787 --> 00:40:13.653
- I know.
- Uh-huh.


1045
00:40:13.787 --> 00:40:15.054
Kitchen's in there.

1046
00:40:32.687 --> 00:40:36.253
My famous wedding
soup is best served


1047
00:40:36.386 --> 00:40:38.787
with a little spontaneity.

1048
00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.553
Surprise, amore mio.

1049
00:40:40.687 --> 00:40:43.620
Surprise doesn't even
begin to describe it.


1050
00:40:43.753 --> 00:40:46.087
How did you do all of
this without my knowing?


1051
00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:48.286
The rooftop was
completely empty before.


1052
00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:50.887
I snuck away during
your busiest hours.


1053
00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.887
Slowly brought things
up one at a time.


1054
00:40:54.087 --> 00:40:56.253
I tried to make an
amazing wedding soup.


1055
00:40:56.386 --> 00:40:57.820
Seemed appropriate for today.

1056
00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.054
I just hope it's edible.

1057
00:41:00.253 --> 00:41:01.720
I'm sure it's perfect.

1058
00:41:02.987 --> 00:41:04.787
♪ By the look in your eyes ♪

1059
00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.954
I thought this can
be our secret spot,


1060
00:41:09.087 --> 00:41:13.653
a sacred place just for us.

1061
00:41:13.787 --> 00:41:16.120
What did I say?

1062
00:41:16.253 --> 00:41:20.854
It's not you, it's just I
really am the luckiest girl


1063
00:41:20.987 --> 00:41:22.087
in the whole world.

1064
00:41:25.453 --> 00:41:27.854
And that must make
me the luckiest guy.


1065
00:41:27.987 --> 00:41:30.020
I don't know what I
would do without you.


1066
00:41:30.153 --> 00:41:32.520
You have sacrificed
so much for me.


1067
00:41:32.653 --> 00:41:35.453
I'd do it over
again in a heartbeat.


1068
00:41:35.587 --> 00:41:37.020
I love you, Roberto.

1069
00:41:40.954 --> 00:41:42.787

Yeah, I've been, uh,
flippin' through it.


1081
00:42:30.887 --> 00:42:31.854
Come up here to read sometimes.

1082
00:42:31.987 --> 00:42:33.020
It's peaceful.

1083
00:42:36.887 --> 00:42:38.220
Oh, new project of mine.

1084
00:42:38.353 --> 00:42:40.587
Basil, bay leaves, rosemary.

1085
00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.054
There's something
beautiful about cultivating


1086
00:42:42.186 --> 00:42:43.153
your life up here.

1087
00:42:47.153 --> 00:42:48.620
Sorry, were you looking for me?

1088
00:42:51.653 --> 00:42:54.553
Are you okay?

1089
00:42:54.687 --> 00:42:57.687
Yeah, it's just been awhile
since I've been up here.


1090
00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:00.820
My memories of Mama
hit especially hard
sometimes, I think.


1091
00:43:00.954 --> 00:43:01.920
Yeah.

1092
00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:08.153
Well, today was Mama and
Papa's wedding anniversary.


1093
00:43:08.286 --> 00:43:11.253
Do you know they celebrated
up here every year?


1094
00:43:11.386 --> 00:43:12.420
Had an inkling.

1095
00:43:15.787 --> 00:43:17.286
Let's go get
that spark module.


1096
00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:18.386
Yes.

1097
00:43:20.954 --> 00:43:23.286
After a quick detour first.

1098
00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.987
Come on.

1099
00:43:31.087 --> 00:43:32.320
Little Italy?

1100
00:43:32.453 --> 00:43:34.286
Mama's home away from home.

1101
00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.186
I figure we could
celebrate Mama's and Papa's


1102
00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.787
wedding anniversary
in her absence


1103
00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.854
by visiting a few of
their favorite spots.


1104
00:43:41.987 --> 00:43:43.553
And according to this,

1105
00:43:44.753 --> 00:43:48.286
favorite gelato place should be

1106
00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.687
right there.

1107
00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.787
So is this little
excursion really just


1108
00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.186
to celebrate Mama and Papa?

1109
00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.087
It may also be a chance
for me to get to know


1110
00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:57.153
my new friend.

1111
00:43:57.286 --> 00:43:59.120
What do you wanna know?

1112
00:43:59.253 --> 00:44:01.253
Well, you wanted to
keep Mama's memory alive,


1113
00:44:01.386 --> 00:44:03.054
let's keep it alive.

1114
00:44:03.186 --> 00:44:05.054
Tell me about what it was
like growing up with her.


1115
00:44:05.186 --> 00:44:07.420
Well, she kind of
helped my dad raise me


1116
00:44:07.553 --> 00:44:08.854
after we lost my mom.

1117
00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.253
She became my surrogate mama.

1118
00:44:13.386 --> 00:44:16.420
And she was just
always there for me,


1119
00:44:16.553 --> 00:44:18.220
especially after my dad
retired and moved to Florida,


1120
00:44:18.353 --> 00:44:19.587
left me the apartment.

1121
00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:20.854
How traditionally
New York, eh?


1122
00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.520
And she and Papa
both taught me better


1123
00:44:25.653 --> 00:44:27.087
than to settle for second-best.

1124
00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:28.587
Gosh, told me
everything about Papa.


1125
00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:29.854
Yeah.

1126
00:44:29.987 --> 00:44:31.687
You're really lucky
to have known him.


1127
00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:33.353
Yeah.

1128
00:44:33.487 --> 00:44:36.587
You know, you, uh,
you never told me about


1129
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.353
the last time you
and Mama spoke.


1130
00:44:40.386 --> 00:44:42.687
You know, we should really
go find that spark thing.


1131
00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:43.687
Aw, come on.

1132
00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.253
Now you're deflecting.

1133
00:44:45.386 --> 00:44:46.520
Come on.

1134
00:44:46.653 --> 00:44:48.020
There's not much to tell.

1135
00:44:48.153 --> 00:44:52.186
I mean, it was about a year
after I left Mama's and...


1136
00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:54.386
Amy?

1137
00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:55.386
Surprise!

1138
00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.253
I haven't seen you in months!

1139
00:44:57.386 --> 00:44:58.753
I know.

1140
00:44:58.887 --> 00:45:00.253
I've been so busy
at the new job.


1141
00:45:00.386 --> 00:45:01.854
It's unforgivable, I'm sorry.

1142
00:45:05.887 --> 00:45:08.120
Well, Chow's more
about professionalism


1143
00:45:08.253 --> 00:45:09.587
than getting your hands dirty.

1144
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.320
Oh, sounds like a lot of fun.

1145
00:45:11.453 --> 00:45:13.153
I know.

1146
00:45:13.286 --> 00:45:14.653
So, listen.

1147
00:45:14.787 --> 00:45:16.320
I heard you guys were
going through a bit


1148
00:45:16.453 --> 00:45:17.653
of a slump lately.

1149
00:45:17.787 --> 00:45:18.920
No.

1150
00:45:19.054 --> 00:45:20.120
The crew let me
in over the weekend,


1151
00:45:20.253 --> 00:45:21.253
and I put together a
little surprise for you.


1152
00:45:21.386 --> 00:45:22.253
What?

1153
00:45:22.386 --> 00:45:23.353
Yeah, come see.

1154
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:25.820
What are we doing?

1155
00:45:25.954 --> 00:45:30.587
I present to you,
Mama's on the Rooftop.


1156
00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:32.487
It could be a whole
new experience,


1157
00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:33.620
attract a younger crowd,

1158
00:45:33.753 --> 00:45:35.420
make Mama's an even
hotter hot spot.


1159
00:45:35.553 --> 00:45:36.520
What do you think?

1160
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:41.587
I think this is not Mama's.

1161
00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.153
What do you mean?

1162
00:45:44.286 --> 00:45:47.820
The rooftop was never
meant for business.


1163
00:45:47.954 --> 00:45:53.153
It was always just
a special place for


1164
00:45:53.286 --> 00:45:54.587
me and Papa.

1165
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.487
Yeah, I thought, I thought
you'd wanna share that


1166
00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:57.487
with the world.

1167
00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:58.854
I don't wanna share it.

1168
00:46:00.186 --> 00:46:05.220
It's a sacred place for, for us.

1169
00:46:05.353 --> 00:46:08.320
I just,

1170
00:46:08.453 --> 00:46:10.353
I just wanted to
help boost business


1171
00:46:10.487 --> 00:46:11.820
and modernize a bit.

1172
00:46:11.954 --> 00:46:15.720
You know, I would just
hate to see Mama's close.


1173
00:46:15.854 --> 00:46:17.453
We're not closing.

1174
00:46:18.353 --> 00:46:20.487
We're doing just fine.

1175
00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:22.320
We don't need any change.

1176
00:46:22.453 --> 00:46:25.987
Please, take this
down before you go.


1177
00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:36.520
And then life just got busy,

1178
00:46:36.653 --> 00:46:38.720
and we exchanged messages,

1179
00:46:38.854 --> 00:46:40.954
but we never got the
chance to reconcile.


1180
00:46:41.087 --> 00:46:42.087
Or say goodbye.

1181
00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:44.820
But I'll always be
her little tesoro.


1182
00:46:44.954 --> 00:46:45.820
Wait a minute.

1183
00:46:45.954 --> 00:46:46.820
What'd you say?

1184
00:46:46.954 --> 00:46:48.520
- Tesoro?
- Mmm-hmm.


1185
00:46:48.653 --> 00:46:50.487
She talked about you.

1186
00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:51.487
What?

1187
00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:52.987
Yes, all the time.

1188
00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.987
She talked about her
tesoro, her treasure,


1189
00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:56.987
how she missed you
dearly, how she loved you.


1190
00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.653
I just realized she
was talkin' about you.


1191
00:46:59.787 --> 00:47:01.286
You don't have to try
to make me feel better.


1192
00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:02.420
No, trust me.

1193
00:47:02.553 --> 00:47:03.453
I'm not known for
going out of my way


1194
00:47:03.587 --> 00:47:04.687
to be sweet and comforting.

1195
00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.453
I'm telling the truth, Amy.

1196
00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:14.920
So, you ready for
detour number two?


1197
00:47:15.054 --> 00:47:16.553
How many?

1198
00:47:16.687 --> 00:47:18.720
Well, it's up to Mama
and Papa, isn't it?


1199
00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:24.553
All right.

1200
00:47:29.687 --> 00:47:32.120
This is supposed to be
where their favorite


1201
00:47:32.253 --> 00:47:36.553
hotdog spot was, but
times change, I guess.


1202
00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:38.153
But history remains, right?

1203
00:47:39.587 --> 00:47:41.720
Right.

1204
00:47:41.854 --> 00:47:43.453
Let me ask you the same
question you asked me.


1205
00:47:43.587 --> 00:47:45.987
What kind of impact
did Mama have on you?


1206
00:47:47.253 --> 00:47:49.787
Saved me from myself in a way.

1207
00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.186
Used to be a little hard headed.

1208
00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.320
No!

1209
00:47:54.186 --> 00:47:56.720
There are remnants of
the old Frank there, maybe.


1210
00:47:56.854 --> 00:47:57.954
I'm human, after all.

1211
00:47:58.087 --> 00:48:00.653
It's just a defense
mechanism, you know.


1212
00:48:00.787 --> 00:48:02.820
Is that right, Dr. Drew?

1213
00:48:04.653 --> 00:48:06.954
I've seen glimpses
of the real Frank,


1214
00:48:07.087 --> 00:48:08.487
the one who saw I was
having a tough time


1215
00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:11.186
on the roof and orchestrated
an anniversary getaway


1216
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.186
to cheer me up.

1217
00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.186
Yeah, don't mention it.

1218
00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.453
I mean that.

1219
00:48:15.587 --> 00:48:16.920
It's getting a little
too sentimental in here.


1220
00:48:17.987 --> 00:48:19.620
Oh-ho!

1221
00:48:19.753 --> 00:48:20.854
Look at this!

1222
00:48:20.987 --> 00:48:23.687
Mama loved
knickknacks like this.


1223
00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:24.920
It's us!

1224
00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:27.453
It's cute.

1225
00:48:27.587 --> 00:48:28.553
I'll take it.

1226
00:48:30.087 --> 00:48:31.353
What are you
gonna do with that?


1227
00:48:31.487 --> 00:48:32.353
What am I gonna do?

1228
00:48:32.487 --> 00:48:33.520
We'll find a spot for it.

1229
00:48:33.653 --> 00:48:35.186
And I love what it represents.

1230
00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:39.286
Friendship is all
about understanding
and trust, honesty.


1231
00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:40.720
All the things we have now.

1232
00:48:42.253 --> 00:48:43.620
Right.

1233
00:48:43.753 --> 00:48:45.186
So where to next?

1234
00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.487
Last stop.

1235
00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:47.954
This one's a special one.

1236
00:48:49.153 --> 00:48:51.453
Thank you.

1237
00:48:51.587 --> 00:48:55.020
Mama's recipe
for a successful marriage.


1238
00:49:00.487 --> 00:49:01.920
I didn't think we'd
get a moment of peace


1239
00:49:02.054 --> 00:49:05.253
and quiet today.

1240
00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:09.920
Hmm.

1241
00:49:10.054 --> 00:49:12.320
You're nervous about the future.

1242
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:18.186
It's a good nervous.

1243
00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:22.087
Here.

1244
00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:24.687
This is a worry.

1245
00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:25.687
No.

1246
00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.720
This is a rock.

1247
00:49:27.854 --> 00:49:30.920
Yes, but imagine it's a worry,

1248
00:49:31.054 --> 00:49:33.020
a fear, a problem.

1249
00:49:34.487 --> 00:49:38.054
Hold onto it for a second,
but only for a second.


1250
00:49:38.186 --> 00:49:41.087
And then...

1251
00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:42.353
Oh!

1252
00:49:43.487 --> 00:49:46.220
Let go!

1253
00:49:46.353 --> 00:49:48.253
My father put a lot
of pressure on me


1254
00:49:48.386 --> 00:49:50.753
to make something of
myself like my brothers did


1255
00:49:50.887 --> 00:49:52.253
back in Tuscany.

1256
00:49:52.386 --> 00:49:53.753
They all had made their
mark in the wine industry,


1257
00:49:53.887 --> 00:49:55.887
but I had other plans.

1258
00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:59.286
It was my mother who encouraged
me to follow my heart.


1259
00:50:01.687 --> 00:50:04.887
And look what happened.

1260
00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:06.054
It led me to you.

1261
00:50:12.687 --> 00:50:16.087
Hmm?

1262
00:50:18.553 --> 00:50:19.920
Don't you feel lighter?

1263
00:50:20.054 --> 00:50:21.353
Much lighter.

1264
00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.020
We should get back
before the reception.


1265
00:50:26.153 --> 00:50:27.687
Okay, but first,

1266
00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:31.420
one for each of my new in-laws.

1267
00:50:31.553 --> 00:50:32.920
Hey!

1268
00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.753
Recipe for a
successful marriage.


1269
00:50:36.887 --> 00:50:40.520
One part trust, one
part communication,


1270
00:50:40.653 --> 00:50:43.253
and many parts wine and pasta.

1271
00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:46.286
That tracks.

1272
00:50:47.653 --> 00:50:49.020
You know, Mama had
a new lesson for me


1273
00:50:49.153 --> 00:50:50.353
every time I came to work.

1274
00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:52.887
Guess I could look at
these as all the ones


1275
00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:54.020
we never got to.

1276
00:50:56.487 --> 00:50:59.687
You know, deep down
she forgives you,


1277
00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:02.253
no matter what happened.

1278
00:51:02.386 --> 00:51:05.320
You can let go.

1279
00:51:05.453 --> 00:51:12.087
Hmm.

1280
00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:17.253
Come here.

1281
00:51:17.386 --> 00:51:18.987
Come here.

1282
00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.653
All right, give me that.

1283
00:51:46.653 --> 00:51:48.320
hat?

1284
00:51:48.453 --> 00:51:49.787
I cannot believe
you found a place


1285
00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.787
that sells vintage
appliance parts.


1286
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.020
I knew a guy.

1287
00:51:53.153 --> 00:51:54.153
I mean, key to finding
anything in this city,


1288
00:51:54.286 --> 00:51:55.153
you gotta know a guy.

1289
00:51:55.286 --> 00:51:56.453
I was very impressed.

1290
00:51:56.587 --> 00:51:57.620
You're so much more
than just the weirdo


1291
00:51:57.753 --> 00:51:58.787
I met that the coffee shop.

1292
00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:00.520
You love calling me weird.

1293
00:52:00.653 --> 00:52:01.587
It was cute.

1294
00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.520
Listen, thank you for today.

1295
00:52:03.653 --> 00:52:05.920
It's been tough doing
this without her.


1296
00:52:06.054 --> 00:52:07.520
I think it's made
me a little messy


1297
00:52:07.653 --> 00:52:09.520
in terms of how I've been
handling things around here.


1298
00:52:09.653 --> 00:52:10.820
Messy's okay sometimes.

1299
00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:17.753
Uh, eh, it's your stop.

1300
00:52:17.887 --> 00:52:19.753
I'm gonna go pick
up a few more things


1301
00:52:19.887 --> 00:52:21.186
for the soft open tomorrow.

1302
00:52:23.653 --> 00:52:24.887
Mmm-hmm.

1303
00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:26.153
All right.

1304
00:52:26.286 --> 00:52:27.286
Uh, Frank?

1305
00:52:28.887 --> 00:52:31.253
Were you gonna ask me
out when we first met


1306
00:52:31.386 --> 00:52:32.520
at the coffee shop?

1307
00:52:32.653 --> 00:52:33.987
Is that why you were
acting so weird?


1308
00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:35.020
What?

1309
00:52:35.153 --> 00:52:36.054
At?

1310
00:52:36.186 --> 00:52:37.153
The?

1311
00:52:39.386 --> 00:52:40.920
Okay, it's just
too bad, because I,


1312
00:52:41.054 --> 00:52:43.153
I think there's a chance
I might've said yes.


1313
00:52:45.054 --> 00:52:49.253
Uh.

1314
00:53:04.553 --> 00:53:05.620
She's as good as new.

1315
00:53:05.753 --> 00:53:07.320
Just in time.

1316
00:53:16.386 --> 00:53:18.087
Papa made the
perfect cappuccino.


1317
00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:22.220
His secret, that extra
splash of espresso.


1318
00:54:25.153 --> 00:54:26.054
Hey, boss lady.

1319
00:54:26.186 --> 00:54:27.320
What you doin'?

1320
00:54:27.453 --> 00:54:28.887
Ah, I was just reading
about how Mama and Papa


1321
00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:31.020
got together at
this little cafe.


1322
00:54:31.153 --> 00:54:32.987
Oh, kind of like how
you and Frank met, hmm?


1323
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.553
I know what you're implying.

1324
00:54:34.687 --> 00:54:36.353
But no, it's a little
different, actually.


1325
00:54:36.487 --> 00:54:38.153
Hmm, interesting.

1326
00:54:38.286 --> 00:54:40.987
Tell me, where did
you two go yesterday


1327
00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:43.487
that was so important
you had to cancel


1328
00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:45.054
drinks with me?

1329
00:54:45.186 --> 00:54:46.653
It was pretty important.

1330
00:54:46.787 --> 00:54:47.854
Mmm-hmm.

1331
00:54:47.987 --> 00:54:49.720
We had to find a spare
part for the stove.


1332
00:54:49.854 --> 00:54:51.320
Mmm.

1333
00:54:51.453 --> 00:54:52.753
Oh, but first we went for a
little walk in Little Italy,


1334
00:54:52.887 --> 00:54:54.153
and then we went to this
cute, little flea market,


1335
00:54:54.286 --> 00:54:56.220
and then to the East River.

1336
00:54:58.954 --> 00:55:00.220
He pulled a Mama.

1337
00:55:01.054 --> 00:55:01.954
A what?

1338
00:55:02.087 --> 00:55:03.720
A reverse date.

1339
00:55:03.854 --> 00:55:05.920
It's how she and
Papa got together.


1340
00:55:06.054 --> 00:55:07.520
He didn't know he was
on a date until he was


1341
00:55:07.653 --> 00:55:08.553
already on it.

1342
00:55:08.687 --> 00:55:10.087
Oh, wow, that's genius.

1343
00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.054
She was a genius!

1344
00:55:12.186 --> 00:55:14.286
Listen, I need to go
put this stuff away,


1345
00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:17.087
but this conversation
is not over.


1346
00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:18.087
Okay.

1347
00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:19.087
Not over, missy.

1348
00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:20.186
Okay.

1349
00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:23.587
Benvenuto.

1350
00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.620
Mama's will be open
in just a few minutes.


1351
00:55:25.753 --> 00:55:27.386
I had to be first
to make a reservation.


1352
00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.620
The tiramisu looks delicious.

1353
00:55:29.753 --> 00:55:31.054
I don't care what
that review said.


1354
00:55:31.186 --> 00:55:33.087
If Mama loved it, I'm
sure I'll love it, too.


1355
00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:35.253
Review? What review?

1356
00:55:35.386 --> 00:55:37.220
The review from The Times.

1357
00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:40.553
Oh, boy.

1358
00:55:41.687 --> 00:55:42.587
He didn't tell you about this?

1359
00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:43.887
No, no.

1360
00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:45.420
He didn't tell his
boss that the menu


1361
00:55:45.553 --> 00:55:47.687
he's been fighting so hard for
has been panned by critics.


1362
00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:48.720
One critic.

1363
00:55:48.854 --> 00:55:50.087
Kimberly Ramirez,

1364
00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:51.720
the top critic in
all of New York.


1365
00:55:51.854 --> 00:55:55.220
That's the equivalent of
like 10 really good critics.


1366
00:55:55.353 --> 00:55:56.220
Fair.

1367
00:55:56.353 --> 00:55:57.453
What are you gonna do?

1368
00:55:57.587 --> 00:56:00.887
I wanted to give him a
chance, but after this?


1369
00:56:03.653 --> 00:56:05.286
We can't serve his
menu at Mama's.


1370
00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:09.820
All right, everyone.

1371
00:56:09.954 --> 00:56:11.453
Gather round, please!

1372
00:56:13.253 --> 00:56:15.520
So this is our first official
run through as a team,


1373
00:56:15.653 --> 00:56:17.020
and I know that we
are going to make


1374
00:56:17.153 --> 00:56:19.120
Mama and Papa very proud.

1375
00:56:19.253 --> 00:56:21.320
So, Frank, of course, will cook.

1376
00:56:21.453 --> 00:56:23.020
Sal and Christine
will host and serve.


1377
00:56:23.153 --> 00:56:26.020
Lorenzo is going to take
care of everything else


1378
00:56:26.153 --> 00:56:27.787
with the help of our new hires,

1379
00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.520
and Emily and I will take
orders and run the cash.


1380
00:56:30.653 --> 00:56:31.620
Sound good?

1381
00:56:31.753 --> 00:56:32.653
Really?

1382
00:56:32.787 --> 00:56:33.954
Your hard work has paid off.

1383
00:56:34.087 --> 00:56:35.520
You've just been promoted.

1384
00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:39.487
Okay, okay, okay, we're
officially on a time crunch,


1385
00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:40.520
so let's prep.

1386
00:56:40.653 --> 00:56:42.587
All right, all right, okay.

1387
00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:43.653
Frank.

1388
00:56:43.787 --> 00:56:44.787
Yeah?

1389
00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:46.286
About the menu, take this.

1390
00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:47.453
We're gonna make some changes,

1391
00:56:47.587 --> 00:56:49.553
so if you have any
questions, let me know.


1392
00:56:52.153 --> 00:56:55.687
Got it.

1393
00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:57.620
So why'd the menu change?

1394
00:56:57.753 --> 00:56:58.987
We're just gonna
keep things simple


1395
00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:01.253
so we can serve more
customers more efficiently.


1396
00:57:01.386 --> 00:57:02.253
Okay.

1397
00:57:02.386 --> 00:57:03.553
Benvenuti, welcome to Mama's.

1398
00:57:03.687 --> 00:57:05.253
All right, keep it tight.

1399
00:57:05.386 --> 00:57:07.054
Knees lookin' weak,
Tom, let's go.


1400
00:57:07.186 --> 00:57:08.087
Yup.

1401
00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:09.087
Hey, how's it goin' here?

1402
00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:10.253
- Oh, beautifully, Sal.
- Nice.


1403
00:57:10.386 --> 00:57:11.687
Took me all morning,
but I pre-prepped


1404
00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:13.920
quite a bit of my wild
mushroom crostini,


1405
00:57:14.054 --> 00:57:16.054
branzino and pork chop frisee.

1406
00:57:16.186 --> 00:57:17.253
Uh-oh.

1407
00:57:17.386 --> 00:57:18.553
Uh-oh? What?

1408
00:57:18.687 --> 00:57:21.153
Well, you didn't look
over the new prep sheet?


1409
00:57:21.286 --> 00:57:22.186
Amy updated it.

1410
00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.954
Only includes Mama's staples.

1411
00:57:24.854 --> 00:57:26.087
Not now. What?

1412
00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:27.854
Yeah, it's only the staples.

1413
00:57:27.987 --> 00:57:29.253
You did prep that stuff, no?

1414
00:57:29.386 --> 00:57:30.420
Yeah, no, of course.

1415
00:57:30.553 --> 00:57:31.854
I just, I'm, I assumed
we'd be selling


1416
00:57:31.987 --> 00:57:33.753
equal amount of my items, too.

1417
00:57:33.887 --> 00:57:34.920
Oof.

1418
00:57:35.054 --> 00:57:36.854
Why would she
change the menu, Sal?


1419
00:57:36.987 --> 00:57:38.920
Hey, first order's
up for spaghetti,


1420
00:57:39.054 --> 00:57:40.720
three chicken parm,
two fettucine.


1421
00:57:40.854 --> 00:57:41.753
Three chicken parm?

1422
00:57:41.887 --> 00:57:43.054
Okay, okay, okay.

1423
00:57:43.186 --> 00:57:44.220
It's gonna take a
whole half an hour.


1424
00:57:44.353 --> 00:57:45.253
It's okay, it's
okay, we got this.


1425
00:57:45.386 --> 00:57:46.253
Let's go. Gonna help out.

1426
00:57:46.386 --> 00:57:47.253
Let's jump in.

1427
00:57:47.386 --> 00:57:48.320
The three chicken parms
all day, let's go.


1428
00:57:48.453 --> 00:57:50.087
- Enjoy.
- Thank goodness.


1429
00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:51.353
What is going on back there?

1430
00:57:51.487 --> 00:57:52.553
Well, Frank didn't
prep enough of Mama's


1431
00:57:52.687 --> 00:57:53.753
signature dishes.

1432
00:57:53.887 --> 00:57:54.753
What, didn't he
get the changes?


1433
00:57:54.887 --> 00:57:56.687
- I don't know.
- Well, what happened?


1434
00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:57.687
Why didn't you tell me
you made these changes?


1435
00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:59.054
- You tryin' to set me up?
- Set you up?


1436
00:57:59.186 --> 00:58:00.054
I gave you the folder.

1437
00:58:00.253 --> 00:58:01.420
All you had to do was open it.

1438
00:58:01.553 --> 00:58:03.087
We agreed to use
my menu, remember?


1439
00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:04.587
Yeah, that was before
I knew about the review


1440
00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:05.620
in The Times.

1441
00:58:05.753 --> 00:58:07.420
Oh, this is not good.

1442
00:58:07.553 --> 00:58:09.487
I was gonna, I was
gonna tell you about that.


1443
00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:10.920
When?

1444
00:58:11.054 --> 00:58:12.253
A few weeks from now
after we already reopened?


1445
00:58:12.386 --> 00:58:13.753
I was waiting
for the right time.


1446
00:58:13.887 --> 00:58:15.587
You know what, it's really
hard to work with someone


1447
00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:18.920
who doesn't reciprocate
trust and honesty


1448
00:58:19.054 --> 00:58:20.320
and communication.

1449
00:58:20.453 --> 00:58:21.320
Amy.

1450
00:58:21.453 --> 00:58:22.320
I thought we had that.

1451
00:58:22.453 --> 00:58:23.587
I thought we were friends.

1452
00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:28.620
Okay, guess I was wrong.

1453
00:58:28.753 --> 00:58:29.787
All right.

1454
00:58:43.253 --> 00:58:46.520
No, look, I mean, this
is almost an exact replica.


1455
00:58:46.653 --> 00:58:48.286
You know, I mean, almost.

1456
00:58:49.987 --> 00:58:52.520
I haven't been able to say
goodbye to Galaxy Blast yet.


1457
00:58:52.653 --> 00:58:55.353
Are you still thinking
about leaving for another job?


1458
00:58:55.487 --> 00:58:57.020
My interview's this afternoon.

1459
00:58:57.153 --> 00:58:58.520
It's a new era here, Sal.

1460
00:58:58.653 --> 00:59:00.186
I'm just in the way.

1461
00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:02.186
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a second.


1462
00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.186
You've never given up
on anything this easily.


1463
00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:05.753
What aren't you telling me?

1464
00:59:05.887 --> 00:59:06.753
Huh?

1465
00:59:06.887 --> 00:59:07.753
It's Amy, isn't it?

1466
00:59:07.887 --> 00:59:09.220
See, I knew it.

1467
00:59:09.353 --> 00:59:10.753
Listen, you go in there,
you just be honest with her.


1468
00:59:10.887 --> 00:59:12.520
You lay it all out, you earn
some of that trust back.


1469
00:59:12.653 --> 00:59:14.253
It's not that
simple, Sal, okay?


1470
00:59:14.386 --> 00:59:16.386
Being here is just
not my destino,


1471
00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:17.620
and I've accepted that.

1472
00:59:20.153 --> 00:59:22.353
Had a lot of good times
together, old pal.


1473
00:59:22.487 --> 00:59:23.520
Yeah.

1474
00:59:23.653 --> 00:59:25.087
Yeah, we have.

1475
00:59:30.687 --> 00:59:31.920
You can help
me haul this in the back.


1476
00:59:32.054 --> 00:59:33.720
Yeah.

1477
00:59:38.653 --> 00:59:42.854
Pasta primavera
was Amy's favorite.


1478
00:59:49.687 --> 00:59:50.720
Mama?

1479
00:59:50.854 --> 00:59:51.920
Amy!

1480
00:59:52.054 --> 00:59:53.186
Just in time.

1481
00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:54.920
I'm making your
favorite, primavera.


1482
00:59:55.054 --> 00:59:56.353
Can we talk?

1483
00:59:56.487 --> 00:59:57.553
Sure.

1484
00:59:57.687 --> 01:00:00.087
You talk, I listen,
and I make primavera.


1485
01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:02.854
It's what we do.

1486
01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:08.087
I got a job offer.

1487
01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:09.854
Chow.

1488
01:00:09.987 --> 01:00:11.087
In Midtown.

1489
01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:13.054
They're looking for
an assistant manager.


1490
01:00:13.186 --> 01:00:14.153
Oh.

1491
01:00:16.487 --> 01:00:20.054
Um.

1492
01:00:20.186 --> 01:00:22.520
You should take it.

1493
01:00:22.653 --> 01:00:23.687
Really?

1494
01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:24.887
Well, yeah.

1495
01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:27.687
You know the restaurant
business in and out.


1496
01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:30.353
Papa and I have
taught you everything.


1497
01:00:30.487 --> 01:00:33.253
It's about time you got
to, uh, spread your wings


1498
01:00:33.386 --> 01:00:36.920
and show the world
what you have to offer.


1499
01:00:37.054 --> 01:00:40.220
I know, but this is the
only place I've ever worked,


1500
01:00:40.353 --> 01:00:41.920
and it's so scary.

1501
01:00:42.054 --> 01:00:44.186
You have to take
risks in order to have


1502
01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.653
a rich, fulfilling,
successful life.


1503
01:00:49.386 --> 01:00:53.854
Imagine if I stayed in the
same place my whole life.


1504
01:00:53.987 --> 01:00:57.920
Well, all this would've
never have come to be, right?


1505
01:00:58.054 --> 01:00:59.020
Yeah.

1506
01:01:02.253 --> 01:01:05.787
How am I suppose to leave you?

1507
01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:10.153
You know, when I lost
Papa all those years ago,


1508
01:01:10.286 --> 01:01:11.587
I had two choices.

1509
01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.487
I could continue to grieve,

1510
01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:16.420
or I could live life,

1511
01:01:16.553 --> 01:01:19.753
loving the people who
are right in front of me.


1512
01:01:19.887 --> 01:01:21.553
People like you.

1513
01:01:23.453 --> 01:01:25.320
And it was hard losing Papa,

1514
01:01:25.453 --> 01:01:27.587
and it'll be hard
when you leave.


1515
01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.820
But, Amy, you'll never
get the chance to spread


1516
01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:35.587
the love that you found here

1517
01:01:37.553 --> 01:01:41.653
if I don't let you go.

1518
01:01:43.887 --> 01:01:46.787
I'll come visit you
all the time, I promise.


1519
01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.887
My tesoro.

1520
01:01:49.286 --> 01:01:51.753
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.


1521
01:01:51.887 --> 01:01:53.920
You've done so
much more for me.


1522
01:01:56.453 --> 01:01:57.553
We need a picture together.

1523
01:01:57.687 --> 01:01:58.587
We need a photo.

1524
01:01:58.720 --> 01:01:59.587
Okay.

1525
01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:00.653
- Okay.
- Okay.


1526
01:02:00.787 --> 01:02:01.687
Will you take a picture of us?

1527
01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:03.320
Thank you.

1528
01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:17.487
Tiramisu di
Franco is a sweet reminder


1529
01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:20.653
of the importance
of moving forward.


1530
01:02:20.787 --> 01:02:24.987
Why'd you leave your
last job, Frank?


1531
01:02:27.687 --> 01:02:28.887
Eh, what the heck.

1532
01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:30.153
It's like my 10th interview
and no one's given


1533
01:02:30.286 --> 01:02:31.320
me a shot yet and
why should they?


1534
01:02:32.453 --> 01:02:33.320
I was too proud.

1535
01:02:33.453 --> 01:02:35.487
I wanted to cook a certain way,

1536
01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.220
my manager disagreed,

1537
01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:38.820
and I was let go.

1538
01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:43.553
I deserved it.

1539
01:02:43.687 --> 01:02:46.720
I had passion, but
I wasn't the boss.


1540
01:02:46.854 --> 01:02:50.753
Lesson learned, right?

1541
01:02:50.887 --> 01:02:51.854
Thank you for your time.

1542
01:02:51.987 --> 01:02:53.386
I'll see myself out.

1543
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.386
Appreciate it.

1544
01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.620
No, no, come on, sit.

1545
01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.987
You want an espresso?

1546
01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.087
Uh, sure?

1547
01:03:00.253 --> 01:03:01.120
Okay.

1548
01:03:01.253 --> 01:03:03.320
Duo, espresso, per favore.

1549
01:03:05.587 --> 01:03:07.720
Eh, relax.

1550
01:03:07.854 --> 01:03:09.620
I appreciate your honesty.

1551
01:03:09.753 --> 01:03:11.087
Yeah, blessing and a curse.

1552
01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:13.186
I know that well.

1553
01:03:15.386 --> 01:03:18.286
So what is it that
motivates you?


1554
01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.720
I mean, why do you wanna cook?

1555
01:03:21.887 --> 01:03:25.620
Cookin' to me,
it's, it's, it's food.


1556
01:03:25.753 --> 01:03:27.453
Food is my safe place.

1557
01:03:27.587 --> 01:03:30.887
It's my nonna and my
mom in the kitchen,


1558
01:03:32.054 --> 01:03:33.553
whippin' up some maccugan dish.

1559
01:03:33.687 --> 01:03:38.120
It's garlic and the olive
oil simmering in the pan.


1560
01:03:38.253 --> 01:03:39.487
Best smell in the world.

1561
01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:42.887
And it's just feeling
instantly better


1562
01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:46.054
when you walk in your
house, and you know,


1563
01:03:46.186 --> 01:03:48.487
the sounds and the smells
of the kitchen, you know?


1564
01:03:51.353 --> 01:03:54.386
It's love, it's family.

1565
01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:55.386
That's what I wanna do.

1566
01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.320
I wanna, I wanna make a place

1567
01:03:58.687 --> 01:04:00.286
for love, laughter and family.

1568
01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.687
That simple, really.

1569
01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:04.453
It's all I wanna do.

1570
01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.320
Okay.

1571
01:04:13.653 --> 01:04:15.520
I can offer you a
couple of things.


1572
01:04:15.653 --> 01:04:18.320
I can offer you a lot
of garlic and olive oil


1573
01:04:18.453 --> 01:04:20.453
and a lot of fun in the kitchen.

1574
01:04:20.587 --> 01:04:22.353
Does that interest you?

1575
01:04:22.487 --> 01:04:24.353
You won't regret
this, Mrs. Tucci.


1576
01:04:24.487 --> 01:04:25.620
I'm your guy, for sure.

1577
01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:28.353
Call me Mama.

1578
01:04:28.487 --> 01:04:29.520
Of course, Mama.

1579
01:04:32.087 --> 01:04:33.020
Salute.

1580
01:04:33.153 --> 01:04:34.820
Salute.

1581
01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.020
Menu's prepped for tonight.

1582
01:04:40.153 --> 01:04:41.520
Just experimenting
with a new dish.


1583
01:04:41.653 --> 01:04:43.286
Mmm, duck?

1584
01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:44.687
Duck sugo.

1585
01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:46.220
Hmm.

1586
01:04:46.353 --> 01:04:48.487
You know, Frank, you've been
doing a fantastic job here.


1587
01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:51.186
You proved me right
by hiring you.


1588
01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.186
What can I say?

1589
01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.453
I'm a changed man.

1590
01:04:53.587 --> 01:04:56.020
Well, I'm gonna take a
little advice from Papa,


1591
01:04:56.153 --> 01:04:59.854
and you know that I'm not
really that good at change.


1592
01:04:59.987 --> 01:05:01.087
No.

1593
01:05:03.054 --> 01:05:04.286
But, um.

1594
01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:08.920
What's this?

1595
01:05:09.054 --> 01:05:12.320
Every artist starts
with a blank canvas.


1596
01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:16.920
You should make it your own.

1597
01:05:17.054 --> 01:05:17.920
Me?

1598
01:05:18.054 --> 01:05:19.020
You're ah...

1599
01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:22.587
You trust me to
create my own menu?


1600
01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:25.054
You think you would
like to do that?


1601
01:05:25.186 --> 01:05:26.553
Absolutely, yes!

1602
01:05:26.687 --> 01:05:28.087
Yeah, I've been workin'
on a recipe for tiramisu.


1603
01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:29.087
I think it'll be fantastic.

1604
01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:30.353
Oh, great.

1605
01:05:30.487 --> 01:05:31.620
Let's serve it tonight.

1606
01:05:33.887 --> 01:05:35.186
Yes!

1607
01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:44.420
Mmm.

1608
01:05:44.553 --> 01:05:45.854
There you are.

1609
01:05:45.987 --> 01:05:47.753
We put the finishing
touches in the dining room,


1610
01:05:47.887 --> 01:05:50.020
and I put out a
basket of my biscotti.


1611
01:05:51.653 --> 01:05:52.553
Are you okay?

1612
01:05:52.687 --> 01:05:54.687
I've been doing it all wrong.

1613
01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:55.887
Doing what wrong?

1614
01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:57.854
Taking Mama's
back to square one.


1615
01:05:59.487 --> 01:06:01.820
It's not what she wanted.

1616
01:06:07.753 --> 01:06:10.120
d we he

1617
01:06:10.253 --> 01:06:12.787
some final prep work to do.

1618
01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.487
Where's Frank?

1619
01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:15.687
- Frank?
- Yeah.


1620
01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:17.120
Frank stepped
out to the market.


1621
01:06:17.253 --> 01:06:19.153
Uh, eh, grab some
tomatoes and peppers


1622
01:06:19.286 --> 01:06:20.153
and things like that.

1623
01:06:20.286 --> 01:06:22.054
Oh.

1624
01:06:22.186 --> 01:06:23.153
Bummer.

1625
01:06:23.286 --> 01:06:24.987
He's gonna miss the good news.

1626
01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:26.487
Change of plans.

1627
01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:29.453
We're gonna reincorporate
his items into the menu.


1628
01:06:29.587 --> 01:06:30.820
- Nice.
- Yeah, okay?


1629
01:06:30.954 --> 01:06:31.820
Okay.

1630
01:06:31.954 --> 01:06:32.920
Cool.

1631
01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.954
Okay, look.

1632
01:06:36.087 --> 01:06:36.954
Don't panic, but
Frank's actually at


1633
01:06:37.087 --> 01:06:38.520
a job interview right now.

1634
01:06:38.653 --> 01:06:39.787
- What?
- Yeah.


1635
01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:40.987
That seems like a
great reason to panic.


1636
01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:41.987
He can't leave.

1637
01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.620
I know.

1638
01:06:43.753 --> 01:06:45.620
Well, we gotta get
'em to make up.


1639
01:06:45.753 --> 01:06:46.820
Yeah, but how?

1640
01:06:46.954 --> 01:06:47.920
How what?

1641
01:06:49.487 --> 01:06:51.620
How beautiful is that coat?

1642
01:06:51.753 --> 01:06:52.653
Is it new?

1643
01:06:52.787 --> 01:06:53.687
Yeah, it's beautiful.

1644
01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:55.353
Where you headin'?

1645
01:06:55.487 --> 01:06:56.353
To talk to Frank.

1646
01:06:56.487 --> 01:06:57.653
Did he go to Prospect Park?

1647
01:06:57.787 --> 01:06:58.753
46th Street.

1648
01:06:58.887 --> 01:06:59.787
Manhattan?

1649
01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.087
What's he doing in Manhattan?

1650
01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:02.353
Well, have you seen
the stock of tomatoes?


1651
01:07:02.487 --> 01:07:03.386
The best in New York.

1652
01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.587
You know Frank.

1653
01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.887
Always going above
and beyond, so.


1654
01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:09.087
Yeah, and I mean, I'm
sure he'll be back soon.


1655
01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:10.386
You may as well just
wait for him here.


1656
01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.386
No, I, I need some fresh air.

1657
01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.386
I'll see you in a bit.

1658
01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.487
Yeah, see ya.

1659
01:07:16.153 --> 01:07:17.054
So you're calling him, right?

1660
01:07:17.186 --> 01:07:18.420
Yeah.

1661
01:07:20.687 --> 01:07:22.020
Oh.

1662
01:07:22.153 --> 01:07:23.020
Hey.

1663
01:07:23.153 --> 01:07:25.520
Hey, so how'd it go?

1664
01:07:25.653 --> 01:07:27.020
Couldn't of gone better.

1665
01:07:28.386 --> 01:07:29.520
That's great.

1666
01:07:29.653 --> 01:07:30.920
More importantly,
I realized something.


1667
01:07:31.054 --> 01:07:33.253
I think I know what my
recipes have been missing.


1668
01:07:33.386 --> 01:07:34.753
Yeah, you can tell
me about that later.


1669
01:07:34.887 --> 01:07:36.854
Look, Amy's been
lookin' for you.


1670
01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.087
You didn't-

1671
01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:40.253
I didn't tell her
about the interview, no.


1672
01:07:40.386 --> 01:07:41.553
Head over to the

1673
01:07:41.687 --> 01:07:42.753
I told her you were
picking up tomatoes.


1674
01:07:42.887 --> 01:07:43.753
Okay, on it.

1675
01:07:43.887 --> 01:07:44.854
Hey, thanks for covering.

1676
01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:06.820
Frank.

1677
01:08:06.954 --> 01:08:08.253
Hey.
- Amy, uh?


1678
01:08:09.386 --> 01:08:11.420
What are you doing here?

1679
01:08:11.553 --> 01:08:14.320
Uh, I actually came

1680
01:08:14.453 --> 01:08:16.087
to apologize.

1681
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.120
You did?

1682
01:08:17.253 --> 01:08:18.620
Yeah.

1683
01:08:18.753 --> 01:08:19.987
I went a little overboard
trying to replicate Mama's,


1684
01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.220
and I shouldn't of dismissed
your contributions.


1685
01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:27.820
I was just so set on
making Mama proud that I,


1686
01:08:27.954 --> 01:08:32.253
I kind of lost sight
of that very thing.


1687
01:08:32.386 --> 01:08:33.587
What do you mean?

1688
01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:36.120
I was reading
through her cookbook,


1689
01:08:36.253 --> 01:08:37.887
and she included your recipes.

1690
01:08:39.386 --> 01:08:40.820
I didn't realize she
had so much fait in you,


1691
01:08:40.954 --> 01:08:44.386
and I didn't realize that she
was ready to embrace change.


1692
01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.987
Yeah, well, it
wasn't exactly working.


1693
01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.653
Well, maybe that's
because you were only


1694
01:08:51.787 --> 01:08:52.920
one half of a team.

1695
01:08:57.286 --> 01:08:59.054
I wanna move forward
with your menu.


1696
01:09:00.253 --> 01:09:01.153
You do?

1697
01:09:01.286 --> 01:09:02.153
Yeah.

1698
01:09:02.286 --> 01:09:04.320
Mama's wishes should come first.

1699
01:09:04.453 --> 01:09:07.353
And who cares what some
critic thinks, right?


1700
01:09:07.487 --> 01:09:09.653
You know, I was really
embarrassed the other night


1701
01:09:09.787 --> 01:09:11.054
at the soft open.

1702
01:09:11.186 --> 01:09:12.553
Now I know I had
some fault, too.


1703
01:09:12.687 --> 01:09:14.220
I should've talked to
you earlier one-on-one.


1704
01:09:14.353 --> 01:09:16.820
I shouldn't have done that
in front of all those people.


1705
01:09:17.854 --> 01:09:21.353
Hey, can we still be friends?

1706
01:09:23.286 --> 01:09:24.286
Friends again.

1707
01:09:25.954 --> 01:09:29.520
I'll see ya back at Mama's.

1708
01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.153
Dear Amy.

1709
01:09:53.286 --> 01:09:56.420
A new friend inspired
me to write this letter.


1710
01:09:57.286 --> 01:10:01.054
Hey, Mama, I was, uh...

1711
01:10:01.186 --> 01:10:02.887
Is everything okay?

1712
01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:05.653
Yeah, it's okay.

1713
01:10:05.787 --> 01:10:06.820
I, uh.

1714
01:10:08.687 --> 01:10:12.186
I'm just thinkin'
about some of my life


1715
01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:16.054
and one big regret.

1716
01:10:16.186 --> 01:10:17.787
Yeah, I've got
plenty of those.


1717
01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:25.054
You wanna tell me about it?

1718
01:10:25.186 --> 01:10:28.220
I had a special friend.

1719
01:10:28.353 --> 01:10:31.386
Mio tesoro.

1720
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:35.720
And we had this falling
out and it was really


1721
01:10:35.854 --> 01:10:38.487
all my fault because
I had such a big,


1722
01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:42.386
emotional reaction
and I pushed her away,


1723
01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:46.820
and you know, life
goes by, time flies,


1724
01:10:46.954 --> 01:10:49.153
and we all get busy.

1725
01:10:50.186 --> 01:10:53.720
And we lost touch.

1726
01:10:53.854 --> 01:10:56.386
Well, I believe
someone taught me


1727
01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.220
that true friendship
can withstand anything.


1728
01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.854
What would you do if
you were in my shoes?


1729
01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:06.787
I'd write a letter.

1730
01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.753
I think there's something
special and comforting


1731
01:11:08.887 --> 01:11:10.253
about receiving a tangible
memory that can be


1732
01:11:10.386 --> 01:11:11.553
held onto forever.

1733
01:11:13.353 --> 01:11:14.720
I was a shy kid.

1734
01:11:14.854 --> 01:11:17.386
I wrote girls little notes
and poems all the time.


1735
01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.553
I don't know.

1736
01:11:18.687 --> 01:11:19.753
What a romantic.

1737
01:11:19.887 --> 01:11:21.353
Oh, yeah, right.

1738
01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.553
You know, you're both
about the same age,


1739
01:11:25.687 --> 01:11:29.220
and I, I do hope
one day you meet.


1740
01:11:29.353 --> 01:11:32.286
Yeah, I'm not so
great at relationships.


1741
01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:34.720
She'd really be having
to compromise with me.


1742
01:11:34.854 --> 01:11:35.887
Mmm.

1743
01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:36.887
Hey, when do you
leave for Napoli?


1744
01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:37.987
Tomorrow night.

1745
01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:43.453
All right, have fun.

1746
01:11:44.753 --> 01:11:46.220
Don't eat too much gnocci.

1747
01:11:47.353 --> 01:11:48.587
Water my plants.

1748
01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.153
I got it, I got it.

1749
01:11:58.753 --> 01:12:01.286
I'm sorry that
we've fallen out of touch.


1750
01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:05.120
I take responsibility
for how I reacted,


1751
01:12:05.253 --> 01:12:08.620
but the wonderful thing
about relationships is,


1752
01:12:08.753 --> 01:12:11.787
they can withstand
just about anything.


1753
01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.620
Life might change
and time may pass,


1754
01:12:14.753 --> 01:12:16.854
but family is forever.

1755
01:12:16.987 --> 01:12:18.787
Papa taught me that.

1756
01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:21.620
And just like Papa, no
matter where you are,


1757
01:12:21.753 --> 01:12:23.954
I'll always be there with you.

1758
01:12:24.087 --> 01:12:26.520
Love always, Mama.

1759
01:12:39.453 --> 01:12:43.620
Frank, wait.

1760
01:12:43.753 --> 01:12:44.620
What's this?

1761
01:12:44.753 --> 01:12:45.820
I found it in Mama's cookbook.

1762
01:12:45.954 --> 01:12:47.453
She hadn't sent it to me.

1763
01:12:47.587 --> 01:12:50.087
Did you tell her to
write this letter?


1764
01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.353
This is the closure
I never had with her


1765
01:12:57.487 --> 01:12:59.220
and you helped me find that.

1766
01:13:01.987 --> 01:13:05.854
You have no idea what
this means to me.


1767
01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.353
Frank.

1768
01:13:09.487 --> 01:13:10.520
Hey.

1769
01:13:10.653 --> 01:13:11.520
Sorry to interrupt.

1770
01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:13.386
This'll just take a moment.

1771
01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:14.687
I don't know if you're aware,

1772
01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:16.087
but this guy is one
tough nut to crack.


1773
01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:17.887
He just won't give
me a straight answer.


1774
01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:20.220
Look, Frank, I came by
tonight to see if there's


1775
01:13:20.353 --> 01:13:22.587
anything else I can do
to sweeten the deal.


1776
01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:25.487
Now we would love to have
you as head chef at Reggio's.


1777
01:13:27.186 --> 01:13:29.353
Come on. How about it?

1778
01:13:35.987 --> 01:13:39.054
Amy, wait.

1779
01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:46.553
Benvenuti.

1780
01:13:46.687 --> 01:13:48.553
Welcome to Mama's.

1781
01:13:48.687 --> 01:13:51.253
I hope you enjoy your
experience here tonight.


1782
01:13:51.386 --> 01:13:52.720
Take a trip down
memory lane with us,


1783
01:13:52.854 --> 01:13:55.087
but keep an open mind, because
we have some new treats


1784
01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:56.220
for you, as well.

1785
01:13:56.353 --> 01:13:57.954
Okay, come on in.

1786
01:14:02.153 --> 01:14:03.286
Hey, welcome. Welcome back.

1787
01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:04.386
Come on in.

1788
01:14:06.153 --> 01:14:07.787
One for you.

1789
01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:10.453
And the wine list
is on the back.


1790
01:14:10.587 --> 01:14:11.854
I gotta tell ya,

1791
01:14:11.987 --> 01:14:13.020
there's something
different about you lately.


1792
01:14:13.153 --> 01:14:14.787
I feel revitalized, Sal.

1793
01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:16.020
I do.
- Yeah.


1794
01:14:16.153 --> 01:14:17.653
Finally took the
time to slow down


1795
01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:20.120
and reconnect with what
I'm doing, you know?


1796
01:14:20.253 --> 01:14:21.320
Try this, try this.
- Nice.


1797
01:14:21.453 --> 01:14:22.620
Okay.
- What do you think?


1798
01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:25.954
That's delicious.

1799
01:14:26.087 --> 01:14:27.120
You are back, baby.

1800
01:14:27.253 --> 01:14:28.220
I'm back, baby.

1801
01:14:29.753 --> 01:14:31.253
It's too bad being back
actually means you're leaving,


1802
01:14:31.386 --> 01:14:32.286
but, eh.

1803
01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:33.286
Aw, come on.

1804
01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:34.286
Don't, don't do that.

1805
01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:35.787
Oh, how I'll
miss you constantly


1806
01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.020
shovin' down your emotions, huh?

1807
01:14:37.153 --> 01:14:38.553
It's not like we won't
be friends anymore, Sal.


1808
01:14:38.687 --> 01:14:39.620
I know.

1809
01:14:39.753 --> 01:14:41.653
I'm being dramatic.

1810
01:14:41.787 --> 01:14:43.286
Have you had a chance
to talk to Amy yet?


1811
01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:44.286
What do you think?

1812
01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:45.286
I think you should
tell her how you feel.


1813
01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:46.286
I meant the-

1814
01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:47.620
I know you meant the branzino.

1815
01:14:47.753 --> 01:14:48.620
But you're leaving.

1816
01:14:48.753 --> 01:14:49.820
What have you got to lose?

1817
01:14:49.954 --> 01:14:51.087
Wasn't Mama all
about taking risks?


1818
01:14:53.753 --> 01:14:56.020
Ppmm, this looks good.

Yeah.

Frank really turned things
around since the soft open.


1825
01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:13.286
Guess your communication's
finally improved.

Better late than never.

1827

1828
01:15:19.353 --> 01:15:20.854
For letting him go.

1829
01:15:20.987 --> 01:15:22.054
Well.

Listen to us apologizing.

You'd never guess two
weeks ago we were the most

You're very welcome.

1863
01:16:27.453 --> 01:16:28.487
It's good to see you.
- You, too.


1864
01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:29.487
I'm afraid I didn't
make a reservation.

Well, thanks, Mig.

1867
01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:33.087
Ah, might be tough tonight.

1868
01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:34.320
No, no, I'm joking.

1874
01:16:42.753 --> 01:16:44.587
I couldn't miss
the grand re-opening.


1875
01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:45.787
Ah.

1876
01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:48.153

missing ingredient.

a Masseto.

1882
01:17:05.286 --> 01:17:06.553
It was Mama's favorite wine.

1883
01:17:06.687 --> 01:17:09.653
It wasn't because of the flavor

1884
01:17:09.787 --> 01:17:12.653
or the steep price tag,
even though she did


1885
01:17:12.787 --> 01:17:14.720
have champagne tastes, oh yes.

1886
01:17:16.453 --> 01:17:17.487
It was her favorite

1887
01:17:19.153 --> 01:17:21.386
because she shared it with Papa.

1888
01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:22.653
Aww.

1889
01:17:22.787 --> 01:17:24.987
Their dedication
and commitment and,


1890
01:17:27.687 --> 01:17:30.820
and everlasting
love for one another


1891
01:17:30.954 --> 01:17:35.020

1921
01:18:55.553 --> 01:18:57.386
Frank, he's in the back
cleaning up, I think.


1922
01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.120
Can you help me
with something?


1923
01:18:59.253 --> 01:19:00.286
- Yeah.
- Okay.


1924
01:19:01.453 --> 01:19:02.854
But it's your move.

She's in her office.

01:19:17.087 --> 01:19:18.120
Thanks.

1932
01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:37.687
Hey, would you do me a favor?

1933
01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:38.787
Sure.

1934
01:19:41.487 --> 01:19:43.520
I can't, I can't find it.

1935
01:19:43.653 --> 01:19:45.520
I lost Mama's cookbook.

1936
01:19:45.653 --> 01:19:47.020
I have a feeling
it will turn up.


1937
01:19:47.153 --> 01:19:49.520
No, but how could I lose it?

1938
01:19:49.653 --> 01:19:51.020
Hey.

1939
01:19:51.153 --> 01:19:53.420
I think there's someone
who wants to see you.


1940

Amy, getting to know you

1941
01:20:08.253 --> 01:20:09.720
has made me realize somethin'.

1942
01:20:11.286 --> 01:20:14.186
Mama made the right choice in
leaving you the restaurant.


1943
01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:16.054
I also realized somethin' else.

1944
01:20:17.253 --> 01:20:18.820
Please meet me where
the room has no walls,


1945
01:20:18.954 --> 01:20:20.286
where the ceiling breaks,

1946
01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:22.386
and only the sky is above us.

1947
01:20:41.087 --> 01:20:42.453
I thought you might wanna
celebrate a great evening


1948
01:20:42.587 --> 01:20:44.153
with a little dessert.

1949
01:20:44.286 --> 01:20:45.320

1950
01:20:45.453 --> 01:20:46.954
I snuck away in my down time.

1951
01:20:47.987 --> 01:20:52.620
Picked up a few tips from Papa.

1952
01:20:52.753 --> 01:20:54.987
Your famous tiramisu.

1953
01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.286
The one and only.

1954
01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:59.020
Of course I could order
you some chocolate pudding


1955
01:20:59.153 --> 01:21:00.787
off the kid's menu
instead, if you like.


1956
01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:05.087
It's perfect.

1957
01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:06.386
Dining room looks
a little messy


1958
01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:08.353
with my pinball
machine in there.


1959
01:21:08.487 --> 01:21:11.520
Messy can be a good thing sometimes.

I was thinkin' about asking
you out at the coffee shop.


1973
01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:52.087
I knew it.

And I did also sorta
take you on a reverse date.


1975
01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:57.687
I know.

1976
01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:00.753
What I didn't expect was,

1977
01:22:00.887 --> 01:22:04.587
was how much you helped me.

1978
01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.253
You kept Mama's memory
alive when I was


1979
01:22:06.386 --> 01:22:07.453
trying to run from it,

1980
01:22:07.587 --> 01:22:09.153
and that's exactly
when I needed to find


1981
01:22:09.286 --> 01:22:10.587
my passion again.

1982
01:22:12.553 --> 01:22:15.487
How can I thank you?

1983
01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:17.420

I can be bold sometimes, too.

1990
01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.820
I changed my mind.

1991
01:22:37.954 --> 01:22:40.653
I decided to turn down the job.

1992
01:22:40.787 --> 01:22:42.087
You did?

1993
01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:43.587
It was risky.

1994
01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:47.920
Could've been the best thing
that ever happened to me.


1995
01:22:48.054 --> 01:22:51.253
But then I realized
I already had that.

rest of her cookbook blank,


2000
01:23:12.453 --> 01:23:16.320
so what do you say we pick
up where she left off?

Carry on her legacy?
