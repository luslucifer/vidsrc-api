- Mhmm.


635
00:27:32.966 --> 00:27:34.201
Cool.

636
00:27:34.969 --> 00:27:35.968
Here's the real question.

637
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.368
I know Gavin is a total dick,

638
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.373
but otherwise how are
you liking Goosed?


639
00:27:41.075 --> 00:27:42.540
I like it.

640
00:27:42.542 --> 00:27:45.076
- Um, today was awesome.
- <i>It was right?</i>


641
00:27:45.078 --> 00:27:46.848
Today was awesome!

642
00:27:48.081 --> 00:27:50.048
<i>I'd like to have my
own show someday.</i>


643
00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:51.018
You?

644
00:27:52.049 --> 00:27:52.252
You will.

645
00:27:53.854 --> 00:27:55.390
- You think?
- <i>Mhmm.</i>


646
00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:58.792
- No I know it.
- <i>Thank you.</i>


647
00:28:01.828 --> 00:28:04.065
I guess I just hate waiting.

648
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.065
You know what you are?

649
00:28:07.067 --> 00:28:08.866
You're adorable.

650
00:28:08.868 --> 00:28:11.836
Ugh, that's condescending.

651
00:28:11.838 --> 00:28:14.173
Just because I'm
younger and I'm a woman


652
00:28:14.175 --> 00:28:17.175
you assume I don't have a
problem being infantilized.


653
00:28:17.177 --> 00:28:20.011
Stop it, stop it please
you have to let me finish.


654
00:28:20.013 --> 00:28:22.146
You're also a super
duper cutie pie.


655
00:28:22.148 --> 00:28:23.949
Ugh, asshole!

656
00:28:23.951 --> 00:28:26.884
You have to let a
man finish, come on.


657
00:28:26.886 --> 00:28:28.953
(Slow Music)

658
00:28:28.955 --> 00:28:31.760
God, who put this on?!

659
00:28:33.194 --> 00:28:35.997
<i>This isn't fair,
this isn't right!</i>


660
00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:38.899
<i>I mean, what the fuck?</i>

661
00:28:40.099 --> 00:28:47.506
(Cheering)

662
00:28:47.508 --> 00:28:48.910

663
00:29:01.222 --> 00:29:02.456
Dan:
<i>No.</i>

00:29:04.224 --> 00:29:05.459
(Sighs)

665

<i>Oh fuck.</i>

680
00:30:17.964 --> 00:30:20.100
<i>Oh shit, this is
Hailey's fucking, ugh.</i>


681
00:30:22.202 --> 00:30:23.402
<i>I got it inside the pages?</i>

682
00:30:23.404 --> 00:30:25.240
<i>How did I get it
in the pages?</i>


683
00:30:40.287 --> 00:30:41.489
<i>That's awful.</i>

685
00:30:55.001 --> 00:30:57.269

- <i>Mmmm.</i>


686
00:30:57.271 --> 00:30:59.337
Franny:
<i>You're avoiding the question!</i>


687
00:30:59.339 --> 00:31:01.472
Fine I was once a playwright.

688
00:31:01.474 --> 00:31:04.476
What, no!

689
00:31:04.478 --> 00:31:05.680
Noah:
<i>I know.</i>


690
00:31:06.312 --> 00:31:08.046
It's actually
better than I hoped.


691
00:31:08.048 --> 00:31:10.248
Noah:
<i>It's hilarious right?</i>


692
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:11.452
Yeah.

693
00:31:13.354 --> 00:31:14.353
Playwright from New York.

694
00:31:14.355 --> 00:31:15.354
Noah:
<i>I know,</i>


695
00:31:15.356 --> 00:31:16.621
<i>who woulda thought?</i>

696
00:31:16.623 --> 00:31:18.323
So what happened?

697
00:31:18.325 --> 00:31:20.157
Nobody liked your plays
because plays suck?


698
00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:21.192
Noah:
<i>Plays do not suck,</i>


699
00:31:21.194 --> 00:31:23.028
<i>plays are the highest
form of dramatic art</i>


700
00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:25.196
<i>and I was actually
pretty good at it, too.</i>


701
00:31:25.198 --> 00:31:27.164
- Oh yeah?
- <i>Yeah.</i>


702
00:31:27.166 --> 00:31:28.266
How good were you?

703
00:31:28.268 --> 00:31:30.001
I had two plays published,

704
00:31:30.003 --> 00:31:32.037
I had a decent
review from Isherwood


705
00:31:32.039 --> 00:31:33.637
who said I was a
wordsmith to watch.


706
00:31:33.639 --> 00:31:36.208
- Franny: <i>Oh Isherwood, nice.</i>
- Yeah.


707
00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:37.275
I know my own reviews.

708
00:31:37.277 --> 00:31:39.280
I can quote 'em
all back to you.


709
00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:44.051
We need more booze.

710
00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:45.549
Noah:
<i>You know what,</i>


711
00:31:45.551 --> 00:31:46.987
<i>we need to eat.</i>

712
00:31:47.654 --> 00:31:49.490
<i>Wait, this-this-this way.</i>

713
00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:52.391
Noah:
<i>This way, here.</i>


714
00:31:52.393 --> 00:31:53.392
Franny:
<i>Oh thank you!</i>


715
00:31:53.394 --> 00:31:54.628
Noah:
<i>No I got it.</i>


716
00:32:03.569 --> 00:32:06.038
Hey Bowser, you read this?

717
00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.405
You read this?

718
00:32:07.407 --> 00:32:09.173
"Someone somewhere can you
understand me a little?


719
00:32:09.175 --> 00:32:11.643
"Love me a little
or am I sentenced


720
00:32:11.645 --> 00:32:13.345
"to a lifetime of solitude

721
00:32:13.347 --> 00:32:16.381
"floating alone down
life's river of pain?"


722
00:32:16.383 --> 00:32:17.816
Dude!

723
00:32:17.818 --> 00:32:19.384
You gotta look after your mom,

724
00:32:19.386 --> 00:32:21.388
she's floating down
rivers of pain in here.


725
00:32:26.492 --> 00:32:27.694
Jesus.

726
00:32:32.198 --> 00:32:33.200
(Sighs)

727
00:32:34.534 --> 00:32:37.504
(Sighs)

728
00:32:45.378 --> 00:32:47.014
Let's take a look.

729
00:32:59.092 --> 00:33:01.094
(Sighs)

730
00:33:02.529 --> 00:33:04.732
It is so hot in Romania.

731
00:33:24.651 --> 00:33:26.654
It is so hot in Romania.

732
00:33:27.553 --> 00:33:29.320
It is so hot in Romania.

733
00:33:29.322 --> 00:33:31.556
(Moans)

734
00:33:31.558 --> 00:33:32.559
Thank you.

735
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:40.265
(Whispering) This
steak costs $62.


736
00:33:40.267 --> 00:33:41.165
Noah (Whispering):
<i>I know.</i>


737
00:33:41.167 --> 00:33:43.300
You have a good job,
you can afford it.


738
00:33:43.302 --> 00:33:46.570
I never even spend
$62 on shoes or


739
00:33:46.572 --> 00:33:47.404
a doctor.

740
00:33:47.406 --> 00:33:49.409
Oh, well maybe
that's the problem.


741
00:33:50.344 --> 00:33:52.176
Problem?

742
00:33:52.178 --> 00:33:53.278
You don't have a problem.

743
00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.747
Franny: <i>You just said
that I have a problem.</i>


744
00:33:55.749 --> 00:33:56.780
- Noah: <i>No.</i>
- You did!


745
00:33:56.782 --> 00:33:58.583
You clearly just said that.

746
00:33:58.585 --> 00:34:00.285
Come on, tell me,

747
00:34:00.287 --> 00:34:01.220
I can take it.

748
00:34:01.222 --> 00:34:03.622
You remind me of me
when I was your age.


749
00:34:03.624 --> 00:34:06.691
I always wanted so much,

750
00:34:06.693 --> 00:34:10.162
<i>but then when I
got what I wanted,</i>


751
00:34:10.164 --> 00:34:12.165
I was always too
afraid to take it.


752
00:34:14.334 --> 00:34:15.332
(Buzzing)

753
00:34:15.334 --> 00:34:17.169
Noah:
<i>Oh my god, one second,</i>


754
00:34:17.171 --> 00:34:18.372
sorry.

755
00:34:20.606 --> 00:34:22.307
Oop, that's my wife,

756
00:34:22.309 --> 00:34:23.511
one second.

757
00:34:30.216 --> 00:34:31.216
- <i>Sorry.</i>
- No it's okay.


758
00:34:31.218 --> 00:34:33.185
Noah:
<i>That was rude.</i>


759
00:34:33.187 --> 00:34:35.620
I didn't know
you were married.


760
00:34:35.622 --> 00:34:38.790
Noah: <i>Yeah, I've been married
for three years now.</i>


761
00:34:38.792 --> 00:34:40.325
Oh wow.

762
00:34:40.327 --> 00:34:43.528
- It's frigging awesome.
- Yeah no, so good.


763
00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:48.368
So intense, but it's also it's
like I think the pinnacle


764
00:34:49.202 --> 00:34:50.637
Franny:
<i>Everything feels deeper.</i>


765
00:34:51.805 --> 00:34:53.337
And there's a sense
of calm knowing


766
00:34:53.339 --> 00:34:55.372
<i>that you find your
person, you know?</i>


767
00:34:55.374 --> 00:34:59.276
Noah: <i>Yeah absolutely.
Sally, my wife, she</i>


768
00:34:59.278 --> 00:35:00.312
Sally, right.

769
00:35:00.314 --> 00:35:01.745
Sally she's so beautiful,

770
00:35:01.747 --> 00:35:04.381
but she's got like
a beautiful spirit.


771
00:35:04.383 --> 00:35:05.385
Franny:
<i>Yeah.</i>


772
00:35:06.519 --> 00:35:08.355
<i>No Dan, Dan is so</i>

773
00:35:09.356 --> 00:35:11.223
good, you know?

774
00:35:11.225 --> 00:35:13.861
<i>He's just incredibly good.</i>

775
00:35:17.263 --> 00:35:19.267
I'm lucky that he's
the person that I love.


776
00:35:32.845 --> 00:35:34.247
Thank you.

777
00:35:39.553 --> 00:35:40.618
Look at this.

778
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.756
(Laughs)

779
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:46.390
- Franny: <i>Oh my god!</i>
- <i>I know, right?</i>


780
00:35:46.392 --> 00:35:49.463
That's so much meat
in one man's mouth!


781
00:35:53.767 --> 00:35:54.969
- I can do it too.
- <i>Oh, yeah?</i>


782
00:35:57.403 --> 00:36:00.037
(Garbled) You're living
the dream, baby!


783
00:36:00.039 --> 00:36:02.242
You're living the dream.

784
00:36:05.444 --> 00:36:07.412
There's this awesome
El Salvadorian bar


785
00:36:07.414 --> 00:36:08.412
right around the corner

786
00:36:08.414 --> 00:36:09.416
Franny:
<i>Uh, II should</i>


787
00:36:10.651 --> 00:36:12.616
I should probably go home.

788
00:36:12.618 --> 00:36:13.821
Noah:
<i>Probably.</i>


789
00:36:16.789 --> 00:36:19.290
Sally's probably
waiting for ya.


790
00:36:19.292 --> 00:36:20.493
Nah, she's out of town.

791
00:36:21.495 --> 00:36:22.563
<i>Goodnight.</i>

792
00:36:25.765 --> 00:36:27.765
Yep, see you tomorrow.

793
00:36:27.767 --> 00:36:29.369
Noah:

- And we can talk about this?

be pregnant right now.</i>

957

Slow down.

It's okay.

959

Huh, it's okay.

of baby names</i>


974

That list was a joke.

Dan:
<i>Jesus, it was not a joke.</i>


976
00:47:36.234 --> 00:47:39.337
That's how you tell me
you wanna have a baby?


977

If you were
pregnant right now,


978
00:47:41.473 --> 00:47:42.473
would you keep the baby?

979
00:47:42.475 --> 00:47:44.011
- No.
- Why not?


980

We're married.

981
00:47:47.314 --> 00:47:49.680
I can want to be married to
you and also not want a child.


982
00:47:49.682 --> 00:47:51.615
Are you saying to me
that you never want to


983
00:47:51.617 --> 00:47:52.716
have a child with me?

984
00:47:52.718 --> 00:47:54.584
No, that's not what I said.
That's not what I said.


985
00:47:54.586 --> 00:47:57.120
Why are we even talking
about this right now?


986
00:47:57.122 --> 00:47:59.126
I'm not gonna have a baby.

987
00:48:00.993 --> 00:48:02.261
What do you want?

988
00:48:10.002 --> 00:48:11.604
I don't wanna fight.

989
00:48:24.684 --> 00:48:26.616

Okay, okay.

993
00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:36.060
That was easy.

994
00:48:36.062 --> 00:48:38.462
Now you have X-ray vision.

Okay.

Wanna know what I did?

00:50:50.296 --> 00:50:51.761
Sure.

1043
00:50:51.763 --> 00:50:54.767
Oh, I had the craziest day.

1044
00:50:56.502 --> 00:50:58.701
So we're on our second
taping of the night, right?


1045
00:50:58.703 --> 00:51:01.939
And Gavin makes Noah
and I completely rewrite


1046
00:51:01.941 --> 00:51:03.874
everything we had
done the night before.


1047
00:51:03.876 --> 00:51:07.178
Like, everything,
which is totally crazy


1048
00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:09.680
because Noah had this great
idea that Gavin either


1049
00:51:09.682 --> 00:51:13.484
<i>never fully understood
or understood too well</i>


1050

<i>and was threatened by
and therefore scrapped it</i>

<i>before it had the
chance to work.</i>

<i>I got so mad but Noah just
takes it in his very calm,</i>

<i>zen-like way, you know?</i>

He has this great
attitude of like, this job


1055
00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.234
doesn't define me.

1056
00:51:30.236 --> 00:51:32.236
Isn't that a great attitude?

1057

Okay, what's wrong?

1060
00:51:57.363 --> 00:52:01.232
Why don't I ever meet the
people that you work with?


1061
00:52:01.234 --> 00:52:02.732
You come home and you're
talking about all these people


1062
00:52:02.734 --> 00:52:04.767
that I've never met

1063
00:52:04.769 --> 00:52:06.370
and you talk about
them all the time.


1064
00:52:06.372 --> 00:52:07.770
So I'd like to meet
them at least so I


1065
00:52:07.772 --> 00:52:09.305
Trust me, you do not
wanna meet Gavin.

mock him to his face.</i>

We should have him and
Sally over here for dinner.

- No.
- <i>Oh, yes.</i>


1110
00:54:13.865 --> 00:54:16.399
So then I lost my mind.

1111
00:54:16.401 --> 00:54:17.700
I just became a total spaz.

1112
00:54:17.702 --> 00:54:18.801
I mean, like, bridezilla.

1113
00:54:18.803 --> 00:54:19.803
I was crying,

1114
00:54:19.805 --> 00:54:20.803
<i>I was screaming,</i>

1115
00:54:20.805 --> 00:54:22.138
<i>I may or may not have
thrown something.</i>


1116
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.073
Noah: <i>No, you only threw my
phone against a wall twice.</i>

(Laughing)

1118
00:54:25.077 --> 00:54:26.377
I know, I'm sorry, honey.

1119
00:54:26.379 --> 00:54:27.477
But I have a good excuse.

1120
00:54:27.479 --> 00:54:29.412
See, I was completely insane.

1121
00:54:29.414 --> 00:54:30.413
Franny:
<i>So what happened?</i>


1122
00:54:30.415 --> 00:54:33.549
It's giving me sweats
just thinking about it.


1123
00:54:33.551 --> 00:54:34.817
Sally:
<i>Thank you.</i>


1124
00:54:34.819 --> 00:54:36.486
Noah, god bless him,

1125
00:54:36.488 --> 00:54:37.553
he sat me down,

1126
00:54:37.555 --> 00:54:38.589
he dried my cheeks,

1127
00:54:38.591 --> 00:54:40.524
and he said that he
didn't care where or when


1128
00:54:40.526 --> 00:54:41.524
we got married.

1129
00:54:41.526 --> 00:54:43.160
Could be in the fucking
dark for all he cared


1130
00:54:43.162 --> 00:54:44.560
I did not curse on
our wedding day.


1131
00:54:44.562 --> 00:54:47.029
You did, you totally did.

1132
00:54:47.031 --> 00:54:50.767
<i>And you said that nothing
could ruin this day</i>


1133
00:54:50.769 --> 00:54:53.672
because it would
always be our day.


1134
00:54:55.441 --> 00:54:56.443
Wow, that's

1135
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:59.446
- that's beautiful.
- Yeah, that's really beautiful.


1136
00:55:00.713 --> 00:55:02.912
We should remember
that for our wedding.


1137
00:55:02.914 --> 00:55:04.180
I thought you were married.

1138
00:55:04.182 --> 00:55:05.482
Franny:
<i>No we are, we just</i>


1139
00:55:05.484 --> 00:55:06.549
we never had a real wedding.

1140
00:55:06.551 --> 00:55:07.953
Probably never will.

1141
00:55:08.787 --> 00:55:09.986
No, we're going to.

1142
00:55:09.988 --> 00:55:11.754
We're going to, now that I can
afford it, we're going to.

Sure.

1145
00:55:14.526 --> 00:55:17.593
March is great, springtime.

Noah: <i>So Dan, what is
it that you do again?</i>


1147
00:55:19.464 --> 00:55:21.432
I know you don't get to
see Franny very often


1148
00:55:21.434 --> 00:55:24.033
'cause she's locked up in
duck, duck, goose jail with me.

Noah: <i>Why did I think
that you're an actor?</i>


1151
00:55:28.774 --> 00:55:30.573
Franny, you told me
he was an actor, right?


1152
00:55:30.575 --> 00:55:32.209
- He is an actor.
- Oh I do that as well.


1153
00:55:32.211 --> 00:55:34.977
- He's an excellent actor.
- No, no.


1154
00:55:34.979 --> 00:55:38.881
Uh, two years ago was the last
time I was paid to act, so.


1155
00:55:38.883 --> 00:55:41.420
Yeah, I'm an excellent actor.

Sally: <i>Oh, no.</i>


1161
00:56:02.475 --> 00:56:05.008
I just feel so bad.

1162
00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:06.609
It was supposed to be like a

1163
00:56:06.611 --> 00:56:09.613
like a poached
halibut um something,


1164
00:56:09.615 --> 00:56:11.747
- <i>brown sauce.</i>
- No, fish is hard.


1165
00:56:11.749 --> 00:56:14.183
- Lemon really helps.
- Mhm.


1166
00:56:14.185 --> 00:56:15.953
Yeah it is, it is hard,

1167
00:56:15.955 --> 00:56:18.522
that's why I told you
you shouldn't try it.


1168
00:56:18.524 --> 00:56:19.790
Which wasn't very helpful.

1169
00:56:19.792 --> 00:56:21.491
Well, I set the table.

1170
00:56:21.493 --> 00:56:22.625
You did.

1171
00:56:22.627 --> 00:56:24.627
He did set the table.

1172
