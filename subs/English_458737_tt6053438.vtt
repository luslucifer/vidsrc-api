TOLLER: <i>I have decided
to keep a journal.</i>


4
00:03:15.853 --> 00:03:18.153
<i>Not in a word program
or digital file,</i>

<i>but in longhand,</i>

6
00:03:20.993 --> 00:03:22.625
<i>writing every word out</i>

7
00:03:22.627 --> 00:03:24.628
<i>so that every inflection
of penmanship,</i>


8
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.028
<i>every word chosen,</i>

9
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.733
<i>scratched out, revised,
is recorded.</i>


10
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.066
<i>To set down all my thoughts</i>

11
00:03:31.068 --> 00:03:33.135
<i>and the simple events
of my day factually</i>


12

<i>and without hiding anything.</i>

one should show no mercy.</i>

<i>I will keep this diary
for one year, 12 months.</i>


15
00:03:45.216 --> 00:03:48.584
<i>And at the end of that time,
it will be destroyed.</i>


16
00:03:48.586 --> 00:03:52.124
<i>Shredded, then burnt.
The experiment will be over.</i>

TOLLER: <i>These thoughts

27

34

<i>of communication
from one to the other.</i>


35

ELDER: There, uh, is a leak
in the men's restroom.


40
00:05:36.394 --> 00:05:38.027
TOLLER: No, I fixed it.

41
00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:39.895
No. I was just there.
It's still leaking.


42
00:05:39.897 --> 00:05:41.998
Same place.
Under the hot faucet.


43
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.700
TOLLER: What about
the women's room?


44
00:05:43.702 --> 00:05:45.402
The women's is fine.
Uh, do you want me to call


45
00:05:45.404 --> 00:05:46.902
the plumber
from Abundant Life?


46
00:05:46.904 --> 00:05:48.404
No, I'll have
another crack at it.


47
00:05:48.406 --> 00:05:50.673
I hate always bugging them
for extra little costs.


48
00:05:50.675 --> 00:05:52.241
They don't mind.
That's what they're there for.


49
00:05:52.243 --> 00:05:53.709
And you're totally
within your budget.


50
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:54.947
Still, I don't want to.

51
00:05:56.682 --> 00:05:57.717
Have you posted the sermon?

52
00:05:58.916 --> 00:06:00.151
- Yes. I did it this morning.
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)


53
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.851
- TOLLER: Oh, hi...
- Reverend?


54
00:06:02.853 --> 00:06:04.688
Yes, uh... Mary, right?

55
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.892
- Mary Mansana.
- Yeah. Nice to see you again.


56
00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:09.228
I wanted to talk,
if that's okay.


57
00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:10.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on in, Mary.


58
00:06:10.762 --> 00:06:12.128
I'll be right back.

59
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.462
Mary, how can I help you?

60
00:06:13.464 --> 00:06:14.931
Um, I was wondering if
you would talk


61
00:06:14.933 --> 00:06:16.466
- to my husband, Michael.
- Oh, sure. I...


62
00:06:16.468 --> 00:06:17.767
Actually, not now.
He has to...


63
00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:18.967
He has to go to work.

64
00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:20.171
He has to fill in
at Home Depot.


65
00:06:22.774 --> 00:06:25.945
Mary? What is it?

66
00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:28.010
I'm worried about him.

67
00:06:28.012 --> 00:06:29.945
He's involved
in the Green Planet movement.


68
00:06:29.947 --> 00:06:31.714
- It's an activist group.
- Mmm-hmm.


69
00:06:31.716 --> 00:06:34.049
And he was in jail in Canada.

70
00:06:34.051 --> 00:06:35.919
And he just got out
two weeks ago.


71
00:06:35.921 --> 00:06:37.353
He just sits around at home.

72
00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:38.955
He doesn't...
He doesn't go out.


73
00:06:38.957 --> 00:06:40.757
I got him
to fill out a temp form


74
00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:42.325
for Home... For Home Depot.

75
00:06:42.327 --> 00:06:44.260
- Okay.
- Um, so that's good.


76
00:06:44.262 --> 00:06:46.128
Are you sure you don't want
to go to Abundant Life?


77
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.863
They have a whole team
of counselors over there,


78
00:06:47.865 --> 00:06:48.998
who are trained and...

79
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.433
I know,
but he doesn't want to.


80
00:06:50.435 --> 00:06:52.267
He thinks it's more of
a company than a church.


81
00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:54.205
And so, he said
he would talk to you.


82
00:06:56.341 --> 00:06:59.045
Uh, all right. Tomorrow?

83
00:07:00.245 --> 00:07:01.945
- After lunch?
- Great. Great.


84
00:07:01.947 --> 00:07:04.380
I'll just need the, uh...
I just need an address.


85
00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:05.751
And, uh, can you tell me
a little more?


86
00:07:06.952 --> 00:07:08.952
Oh, he applied for
Compassionate Release


87
00:07:08.954 --> 00:07:10.452
when he found out.

88
00:07:10.454 --> 00:07:12.188
He was at Fort Providence.
They let him out early.


89
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.957
Wait, now. Um, found out what?

90
00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:15.060
That I... I was pregnant.

91
00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:18.263
Oh. Hmm. Congratulations.

92
00:07:18.863 --> 00:07:20.399
Thanks.

93
00:07:21.365 --> 00:07:25.036
He... He thinks it's wrong to
bring a child into this world.


94
00:07:28.206 --> 00:07:30.743
He wants to kill our baby.

There's no need to apologize.

127
00:10:18.943 --> 00:10:21.579
No, uh... She told me
that you've been up in Canada.

Uh, yeah. Uh, Fort Providence.

- You know, that's...

That's two years older
than I am right now.

Uh, the world
is changing so fast.

of the natural world


158
00:12:04.448 --> 00:12:06.385
has been destroyed
in your lifetime.


159
00:12:07.485 --> 00:12:09.084
You know,
the earth's temperature


160
00:12:09.086 --> 00:12:11.155
will be three degrees
centigrade higher.


161
00:12:12.189 --> 00:12:13.992
Four is the threshold.

162
00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:19.061
You know? "Severe, widespread,
and irreversible impacts."


163
00:12:19.063 --> 00:12:22.665
And when scientists say
stuff like that, you know?

00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:25.604
And National Center for
Atmospheric Research,

Uh, Reverend...

for some time.</i>

<i>By 2050, sea levels two feet
higher on the East Coast.</i>

<i>Low lying areas underwater
across the world.</i>


170
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.652
<i>Bangladesh, 20% loss
of landmass.</i>


171
00:12:42.654 --> 00:12:46.089
<i>Central Africa, 50% reduction
in crops due to drought.</i>


172
00:12:46.091 --> 00:12:47.824
<i>The Western reservoirs
dried up.</i>


173
00:12:47.826 --> 00:12:51.426
<i>Climate change refugees.
Epidemics. Extreme weather.</i>


174
00:12:51.428 --> 00:12:53.097
MICHAEL: You know, the...

175
00:12:54.264 --> 00:12:56.232
The bad times,
they will begin.


176
00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:58.370
And from that point,
everything moves very quickly.


177
00:13:00.205 --> 00:13:01.704
You know,
this social structure


178
00:13:01.706 --> 00:13:04.510
can't bear the stress
of multiple crises.


179
00:13:05.843 --> 00:13:07.542
Opportunistic diseases,

180
00:13:07.544 --> 00:13:09.644
anarchy, martial law,
the tipping point.


181
00:13:09.646 --> 00:13:11.747
And this isn't in some,
like, distant future.


182
00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:13.719
You will live to see this.

183
00:13:14.218 --> 00:13:18.286
You know, my children will
experience this unliveability.


184
00:13:18.288 --> 00:13:19.658
This, uh...

185
00:13:20.225 --> 00:13:22.892
Damn. I'm sorry. I just...
You know, I...


186
00:13:22.894 --> 00:13:25.161
I thought things could change,
you know?


187
00:13:25.163 --> 00:13:27.365
I thought... I thought
people would listen.


188
00:13:27.564 --> 00:13:30.068
Do you have thoughts
of harming yourself?


189
00:13:31.468 --> 00:13:33.104
No.

190
00:13:33.638 --> 00:13:35.805
Why? Did... Did Mary say
something like that?


191
00:13:35.807 --> 00:13:37.440
No. No.

192
00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:40.176
No, I'm not worried
for myself. I just...


193
00:13:40.178 --> 00:13:43.713
This world is gonna be
what it is.


194
00:13:43.715 --> 00:13:46.248
Um... But can I ask you
a question, Reverend?


195
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.385
TOLLER: Mmm-hmm.

196
00:13:48.753 --> 00:13:52.287
How do you sanction
bringing in a little girl,


197
00:13:52.289 --> 00:13:56.325
uh, for argument's sake,
let's just say that, uh,


198
00:13:56.327 --> 00:13:59.398
Mary and I's, uh, child,
it's a little girl.


199
00:14:04.668 --> 00:14:07.106
You know,
a child that's so full of hope


200
00:14:08.673 --> 00:14:10.772
and naive beliefs,

201
00:14:10.774 --> 00:14:13.812
into a world
where that little girl, uh...


202
00:14:15.446 --> 00:14:17.613
She grows up
to be a young woman


203
00:14:17.615 --> 00:14:19.514
and she looks you in the eyes

204
00:14:19.516 --> 00:14:22.386
and she says that you knew
this all along, didn't you?


205
00:14:26.957 --> 00:14:28.860
You see, that...

206
00:14:30.294 --> 00:14:32.865
I mean, what? What are you
supposed to say then?


207
00:14:36.266 --> 00:14:38.667
There's something
growing inside Mary.


208
00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:43.509
Something as alive
as a tree, surely.


209
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.178
As an endangered species.

210
00:14:46.811 --> 00:14:51.350
Something full of the beauty
and mystery of nature.


211
00:14:53.585 --> 00:14:55.654
You said sanction?

212
00:14:57.889 --> 00:15:00.455
You think Mary should have
an abortion?


213
00:15:00.457 --> 00:15:01.857
This birth,
is that your right?


214
00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:03.459
Is that your decision?

215
00:15:03.461 --> 00:15:05.596
Have you asked Mary
what she thinks?


216
00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:13.636
Look, this... This isn't...

217
00:15:13.638 --> 00:15:15.407
It's not about your baby.

218
00:15:16.341 --> 00:15:17.709
It's not about Mary.

219
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.811
It's about you
and your despair.


220
00:15:22.813 --> 00:15:24.382
Your lack of hope.

221
00:15:25.683 --> 00:15:28.517
Look, people have,
throughout history,


222
00:15:28.519 --> 00:15:30.652
have woken up
in the dead of the night,


223
00:15:30.654 --> 00:15:32.854
confronted by blackness.

224
00:15:32.856 --> 00:15:35.427
The sense that our lives
are without meaning.


225

<i>The Sickness Unto Death.</i>

226
00:15:37.928 --> 00:15:39.795
Yeah, but this is
something different.


227
00:15:39.797 --> 00:15:41.796
Yeah, no.
Man's great achievements


228
00:15:41.798 --> 00:15:45.533
have brought him to the place
where life as we know it


229
00:15:45.535 --> 00:15:47.369
may cease
in the foreseeable future.


230
00:15:47.371 --> 00:15:48.774
Yes, that's new.

231
00:15:49.673 --> 00:15:50.875
But the blackness

232
00:15:52.943 --> 00:15:54.643
that's not.

233
00:15:54.645 --> 00:15:56.711
We are scientific people.
We want to solve things.


234
00:15:56.713 --> 00:15:58.613
We want rational answers.

235
00:15:58.615 --> 00:16:00.349
Right? And if...

236
00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:04.619
If humankind can't overcome
its immediate interests


237
00:16:04.621 --> 00:16:06.589
enough to ensure its own
survival, then you're right.


238
00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:09.494
The only rational response
is despair.


239
00:16:10.461 --> 00:16:11.993
But do you think that, that...

240
00:16:11.995 --> 00:16:15.297
That there's any existence
apart from this?


241

This here, right now?

242

- Yeah, right.

the early Christians who
wouldn't renounce their faith?

who were attacked

that they died for a purpose?

276

In 2010, the IPCC predicted

wasn't taken by 2015,

Wisdom is holding
two contradictory truths


319
00:20:17.974 --> 00:20:21.142
in our mind, simultaneously.

320
00:20:21.144 --> 00:20:23.178
Hope and despair.

321
00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.613
A life without despair
is a life without hope.


322
00:20:25.615 --> 00:20:29.221
Holding these two ideas
in our head is life itself.

00:50:37.993 --> 00:50:42.062
Each kid isolated,
communicating on media.


784
00:50:42.064 --> 00:50:43.930
It's a world without hope!

785
00:50:43.932 --> 00:50:45.631
You don't know what it's like
to raise a kid in this...


786
00:50:45.633 --> 00:50:47.002
No, I did raise a kid.

787
00:50:48.803 --> 00:50:50.504
I didn't mean it like that.

788
00:50:50.506 --> 00:50:51.607
I know you didn't.

789
00:50:52.874 --> 00:50:54.808
They're just frightened.
These kids,


790
00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:56.743
- they want certainty.
- Mmm-hmm.


791
00:50:56.745 --> 00:50:58.714
You know, don't think, follow.

792
00:50:59.482 --> 00:51:00.517
Uh...

793
00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:02.952
But they fall prey
to extremism.


794
00:51:03.419 --> 00:51:07.488
Jihadism is everywhere.
Even here.


795
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:10.390
It's just... That's not
the church that called me.


796
00:51:10.392 --> 00:51:11.825
Nor me.

797
00:51:11.827 --> 00:51:14.962
It's up to us. We have
to listen and guide


798
00:51:14.964 --> 00:51:17.497
and encourage
our young members


799
00:51:17.499 --> 00:51:19.433
to express themselves

800
00:51:19.435 --> 00:51:20.901
without judging them.

801
00:51:20.903 --> 00:51:22.471
We have to lead by example.

802
00:51:23.104 --> 00:51:24.773
We have to be patient.

00:51:35.417 --> 00:51:36.716
Oh, this sounds great.

805
00:51:36.718 --> 00:51:38.051
I'm gonna have to sharpen
my chops


806
00:51:38.053 --> 00:51:39.553
for the Reconsecration.

807
00:51:39.555 --> 00:51:41.488
Do you know
what they want to play?


808
00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:42.790
No, I have no idea.

809
00:51:42.792 --> 00:51:44.424
Abundant Life
is handling everything.


810
00:51:44.426 --> 00:51:45.692
Invites, the seating.

811
00:51:45.694 --> 00:51:47.560
Basically,
I just introduce Joel.


812
00:51:47.562 --> 00:51:50.531
And then he does his spiel,
introduces the Governor,


813
00:51:50.533 --> 00:51:51.631
maybe Ed Balq.

814
00:51:51.633 --> 00:51:52.769
Oh, why him?

815
00:51:53.067 --> 00:51:54.868
It's sort of his whole deal.

816
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:56.669
I mean, he's underwritten
the whole thing,


817
00:51:56.671 --> 00:51:58.638
paid to have the organ fixed.

818
00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.573
I do have another
musical question for you...


819
00:52:00.575 --> 00:52:01.674
Oh. Take it from the top.

820
00:52:01.676 --> 00:52:03.379
(PLAYING)

821
00:52:14.924 --> 00:52:19.158
(CHUCKLES) It's actually
a kind of sad bit of business.


822
00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.562
- Hm?
- The Michael Mansana memorial.


823
00:52:21.564 --> 00:52:25.135
The scattering of his ashes.
He's asked me to arrange it.


824
00:52:26.502 --> 00:52:27.704
He's asked you?

825
00:52:28.736 --> 00:52:32.075
Well, he wrote a letter.
He had some requests.


826
00:52:37.046 --> 00:52:41.582
Then the Lord spoke to Job,
stepped from the storm.


827
00:52:41.584 --> 00:52:42.850
He said, "Where were you

828
00:52:42.852 --> 00:52:44.618
"when I laid
the Earth's foundations,


829
00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:47.991
"marked out its dimensions,
laid its cornerstone,

"when the morning stars sang,

831
00:52:54.229 --> 00:52:58.534
"and the angels shouted
with joy? Where were you?"


832
00:53:01.703 --> 00:53:03.736
These surroundings
were chosen by Michael


833
00:53:03.738 --> 00:53:06.540
as the repository
for his physical remains.


834
00:53:06.542 --> 00:53:08.274
I say physical
because his memories


835
00:53:08.276 --> 00:53:10.743
and spirit live on with us,

836
00:53:10.745 --> 00:53:12.913
as does his mission.

837
00:53:12.915 --> 00:53:15.915
Michael cared
about this world.


838
00:53:15.917 --> 00:53:18.651
Perhaps too much.

839
00:53:18.653 --> 00:53:22.589
The Abundant Life Youth Choir
will now sing for us, uh,


840
00:53:22.591 --> 00:53:24.828
a song chosen by Michael.

- Okay. Thank you.

Uh, the apple pie.

but they make it right here.
It's organic. It's local.

I'll introduce the Governor.

There won't be anything
political though, will there?

00:57:15.957 --> 00:57:18.126
No. No, why would there be?

898
00:57:18.526 --> 00:57:20.127
Well... Oh. Sorry.
Do you mind?

00:57:23.198 --> 00:57:25.265
Well, I... I ask, uh,

902
00:57:25.267 --> 00:57:29.502
only cause, um, this came
to my attention.


903
00:57:29.504 --> 00:57:32.305
It's a printout
from a website.


904
00:57:32.307 --> 00:57:34.140
Well, both First Reformed
and Abundant Life


905
00:57:34.142 --> 00:57:36.009
are mentioned by name.

906
00:57:36.011 --> 00:57:39.949
It was a political event.
And a Neil Young protest song?


907
00:57:40.448 --> 00:57:42.082
I was just respecting
the wishes


908
00:57:42.084 --> 00:57:43.917
of the deceased and... And...
And his widow.


909
00:57:43.919 --> 00:57:46.852
It was their instructions
for the memorial service.


910
00:57:46.854 --> 00:57:50.122
At a toxic waste site
with the press in attendance?


911
00:57:50.124 --> 00:57:51.524
There was no press invited.

912
00:57:51.526 --> 00:57:53.359
No. This is just
Mensana's friends.


913
00:57:53.361 --> 00:57:55.227
It was a political act.

914
00:57:55.229 --> 00:57:58.031
You and the choir represented
the Abundant Life Church.


915
00:57:58.033 --> 00:57:59.299
And the Hanstown site,

916
00:57:59.301 --> 00:58:00.901
by the way,
isn't even polluted.


917
00:58:00.903 --> 00:58:02.435
It was cleaned up
with EPA superfunds.


918
00:58:02.437 --> 00:58:04.136
- Well, Hanstown...
- No, no, of course not,


919
00:58:04.138 --> 00:58:06.105
but just give me some credit,
all right?


920
00:58:06.107 --> 00:58:07.339
I'm in the energy business.

921
00:58:07.341 --> 00:58:09.176
It's my business
to stay informed.


922
00:58:09.178 --> 00:58:11.111
(SIGHS) Look, sorry.

923
00:58:11.113 --> 00:58:13.078
Reverend Toller
didn't understand


924
00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:14.349
the implications here.

925
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:17.984
- May I ask a question?
- BALQ: Yeah. Go ahead.


926
00:58:17.986 --> 00:58:19.888
Will God forgive us?

927
00:58:22.424 --> 00:58:25.524
Will God forgive us for what
we're doing to his creation?


928
00:58:25.526 --> 00:58:29.161
That's what Mensana asked me
when I visited him.


929
00:58:29.163 --> 00:58:31.364
This... There's been
a lot of loose talk


930
00:58:31.366 --> 00:58:33.366
about environmental change.

931
00:58:33.368 --> 00:58:36.435
There is scientific consensus.
Ninety-seven percent...


932
00:58:36.437 --> 00:58:40.239
<i>The man who says nothing
always seems more intelligent.</i>


933
00:58:40.241 --> 00:58:42.077
<i>Why couldn't I just
keep silent?</i>


934
00:58:43.412 --> 00:58:45.377
It's a complicated subject.

935
00:58:45.379 --> 00:58:49.017
Not really.
I mean, who benefits?


936
00:58:49.317 --> 00:58:50.584
Cui bono? Who profits?

937
00:58:50.586 --> 00:58:52.151
That's what I keep
asking myself.


938
00:58:52.153 --> 00:58:54.087
Besides the Biblical call
to stewardship,


939
00:58:54.089 --> 00:58:55.422
who profits when we soil

940
00:58:55.424 --> 00:58:56.857
our own nest?
What's to be gained...


941
00:58:56.859 --> 00:58:58.091
Can we just agree
to keep politics


942
00:58:58.093 --> 00:58:59.426
out of
the reconsecration service?


943
00:58:59.428 --> 00:59:02.027
- Yes.
- Yes, but this isn't politics.


944
00:59:02.029 --> 00:59:03.629
I mean, what God wants
is for...


945
00:59:03.631 --> 00:59:06.198
Oh, you, you, you, you...
You know the mind of God?


946
00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.167
You spoke to him, personally?

947
00:59:08.169 --> 00:59:10.572
He told you His plans
for Earth?


948
00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:16.312
Look, I understand,
you're upset.


949
00:59:19.113 --> 00:59:21.449
I mean, you found the body,
correct?


950
00:59:22.484 --> 00:59:23.519
Yes.

951
00:59:25.053 --> 00:59:26.055
How?

952
00:59:32.261 --> 00:59:35.527
I was supposed to meet him.

953
00:59:35.529 --> 00:59:40.970
And he texted me, and...
A change of location.


954
00:59:41.336 --> 00:59:42.337
BALQ: And?

955
00:59:44.673 --> 00:59:46.308
And I went there
and he was dead.


956
00:59:50.312 --> 00:59:52.080
So you counseled him,
Reverend?


957
00:59:53.415 --> 00:59:54.417
Yes.

958
00:59:55.350 --> 00:59:58.220
You counseled him,
then he shot himself?


959
00:59:58.953 --> 00:59:59.955
JEFFERS: Ed?

960
01:00:01.924 --> 01:00:02.925
Yes.

961
01:00:06.328 --> 01:00:09.328
Well, I think you need
to step back, Reverend,


962
01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:10.964
and take a look
at your own life


963
01:00:10.966 --> 01:00:14.036
before you criticize others.
Hmm?


964
01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:37.058
TOLLER: <i>Mary and I
rode the park trail.</i>


965
01:00:38.627 --> 01:00:42.498
<i>I had not ridden a bicycle,
I think, in 20 years.</i>


966
01:00:47.669 --> 01:00:50.038
<i>I was afraid I would fall.</i>

967
01:00:55.644 --> 01:00:59.548
<i>It's amazing the simple
curative power of exercise.</i>


968
01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.422
<i>It's God given.</i>

969
01:01:14.428 --> 01:01:16.629
Thank you again.

970
01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:18.732
Michael and I used to cycle
twice a week,


971
01:01:18.734 --> 01:01:20.332
and I've missed it so much.

972
01:01:20.334 --> 01:01:23.569
No. I enjoyed it.
It's been a long time.


973
01:01:23.571 --> 01:01:25.674
(CHUCKLES)
But it was under protest.


974
01:01:26.707 --> 01:01:29.345
- I... I asked my doctor.
- Really? Still.


975
01:01:31.078 --> 01:01:32.745
Um, can I ask you
another favor?


976
01:01:32.747 --> 01:01:34.180
Sure.

977
01:01:34.182 --> 01:01:36.149
Could you box up
Michael's things?


978
01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:37.620
Or find somebody to do it?

979
01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:42.254
You sure you want to give them
away so quickly?


980
01:01:42.256 --> 01:01:44.056
Not, like... Not give it away,

981
01:01:44.058 --> 01:01:46.026
just, you know.
Just box them up.


982
01:01:46.028 --> 01:01:48.727
It just... You know, I feel...

983
01:01:48.729 --> 01:01:50.363
It's just difficult
to be around


984
01:01:50.365 --> 01:01:53.165
so many smells and memories.

985
01:01:53.167 --> 01:01:54.466
You know?

986
01:01:54.468 --> 01:01:56.069
TOLLER: Yeah, I can...
I can do it.


987
01:01:56.071 --> 01:01:57.337
MARY: (SIGHS) Okay.

988
01:01:57.339 --> 01:01:58.738
TOLLER: Have you decided
what's next?


989
01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:01.241
Um, the rent's paid for
for two months,


990
01:02:01.243 --> 01:02:02.509
so there's no hurry.

991
01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:04.044
But, um, I'm gonna stay

992
01:02:04.046 --> 01:02:05.377
with my sister
and my brother-in-law.


993
01:02:05.379 --> 01:02:07.413
- Hmm. Are you?
- Until the baby is born.


994
01:02:07.415 --> 01:02:09.149
So you'll relocate there?

995
01:02:09.151 --> 01:02:12.989
Yeah. I think so.
She contacted an obstetrician.


996
01:02:14.756 --> 01:02:16.392
Are we talking pink or blue?

997
01:02:17.325 --> 01:02:18.491
- Blue!
- Blue.


998
01:02:18.493 --> 01:02:19.725
Blue!

999
01:02:19.727 --> 01:02:21.060
- Ah! Congratulations.
- Thanks.


1000
01:02:21.062 --> 01:02:22.030
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.


1001
01:02:23.631 --> 01:02:26.165
Oh, hey, uh... I have
a question for you,


1002
01:02:26.167 --> 01:02:29.004
if, uh... If it's not
too painful.


1003
01:02:31.772 --> 01:02:34.140
Do you think he, uh...

1004
01:02:34.142 --> 01:02:36.145
He really would have
harmed someone?


1005
01:02:40.147 --> 01:02:46.555
Um, he'd been a part of some
non-violent protests.


1006
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:51.524
We both had.
He'd been put in jail.


1007
01:02:51.526 --> 01:02:54.761
He had a temper. I mean,
he'd start yelling at police,


1008
01:02:54.763 --> 01:02:57.529
but no, I don't
think he was...


1009
01:02:57.531 --> 01:02:59.602
No. I don't think
he was violent.


1010
01:03:02.504 --> 01:03:04.272
I just, um...

1011
01:03:05.207 --> 01:03:07.774
I can't help
but keep wondering


1012
01:03:07.776 --> 01:03:10.212
what I should have
done differently.


1013
01:03:13.281 --> 01:03:15.418
He didn't want to live.

1014
01:03:19.321 --> 01:03:22.091
He was not a religious man,
you know.


1015
01:03:23.792 --> 01:03:26.493
He didn't care for the church.
That was me.


1016
01:03:26.495 --> 01:03:28.495
I was the one
who asked him to come.


1017
01:03:28.497 --> 01:03:29.828
I was raised in the church

1018
01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:33.265
and I never
could quite let it go.


1019
01:03:33.267 --> 01:03:34.868
I'd be in a strange city,

1020
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:36.401
and I would just go

1021
01:03:36.403 --> 01:03:37.469
to a church and sit down,
you know?


1022
01:03:37.471 --> 01:03:40.109
I was the spiritual one.

1023
01:03:44.912 --> 01:03:46.613
Thanks.

1024
01:03:46.615 --> 01:03:49.616
Yeah. I'll, uh... I'm gonna
go get some boxes.


1025
01:03:49.618 --> 01:03:51.384
I'll come back
for the clothes.


1026
01:03:51.386 --> 01:03:52.721
Okay.

1027
01:03:55.457 --> 01:03:57.692
Uh, Reverend? Um,

1028
01:04:00.395 --> 01:04:03.566
would you pray with me?

1029
01:04:05.466 --> 01:04:07.834
I just... I find it difficult
to do it alone.


1030
01:04:07.836 --> 01:04:11.506
Just, the words,
just don't come.


1031
01:04:12.374 --> 01:04:14.339
Are you uncomfortable
with me asking you that?


1032
01:04:14.341 --> 01:04:15.841
No. No, no, no.
Of course not. Yeah.


1033
01:04:15.843 --> 01:04:16.878
Okay.

1034
01:04:21.448 --> 01:04:23.318

Well, he was out
most of Friday.


1060
01:08:53.855 --> 01:08:55.720
So he went to Albany
for his checkup?


1061

give me any details.

We'd like to do
a gastroscopic exam.

down the throat and esophagus,

That doesn't sound too good.

Well, we'd like to check
for evidence of malignancy.

Cancer.

What's the...
The treatment for that?


1079
01:09:54.615 --> 01:09:57.653
It depends on how far advanced
the tumor is.

1081

1088
01:10:24.145 --> 01:10:26.112
Okay. I'd like to schedule

1089
01:10:26.114 --> 01:10:27.880
the gastroscopy
as soon as possible.

01:10:32.253 --> 01:10:33.222
Okay.

1092
01:10:33.788 --> 01:10:34.790
What's your diet?

1093
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:38.791
My diet?
Um, I'm hungry, I eat.


1094
01:10:38.793 --> 01:10:40.192
- You smoke?
- No.


1095
01:10:40.194 --> 01:10:41.230
Drink?

1096
01:10:42.664 --> 01:10:44.596
Mmm, in moderation.

1097
01:10:44.598 --> 01:10:46.131
That needs to end.

1098
01:10:46.133 --> 01:10:47.567
I'm gonna call in
a prescription to help


1099
01:10:47.569 --> 01:10:49.001
- with the stomach pain.
- Huh.


1100
01:10:49.003 --> 01:10:51.106
And I want you to take
nutritional supplements.


1101
01:10:51.739 --> 01:10:52.841
Okay.

1102
01:10:53.874 --> 01:10:55.109
Are you in pain now?

1103
01:10:56.343 --> 01:10:57.846
No. No. I feel good.

that anxiety and worry</i>

I... I didn't know
you were coming.


1117
01:11:39.287 --> 01:11:41.187
Well, Joel's office called.

1118
01:11:41.189 --> 01:11:42.854
They want to talk to me about
the Reconsecration program.


1119
01:11:42.856 --> 01:11:44.623
Did... Did they talk to you?

1120
01:11:44.625 --> 01:11:46.892
Uh, I'll be at First Reformed.
And Stanley will be


1121
01:11:46.894 --> 01:11:48.794
with the full choir here
for the simulcast.


1122
01:11:48.796 --> 01:11:50.162
Mmm-hmm. Nice.

1123
01:11:50.164 --> 01:11:51.296
The acoustics will
be wonderful. I mean...


1124

Really wonderful.
Did you hear from Albany?


1126
01:11:55.736 --> 01:11:56.801
Yeah. I did.

1127
01:11:56.803 --> 01:11:57.903
Well, what did they say?

1128
01:11:57.905 --> 01:11:59.237
Nothing. Just some more tests.

1129
01:11:59.239 --> 01:12:00.741
A gastroscopy.

1130

And you know this how?

1131
01:12:04.979 --> 01:12:06.312
I called.

1132
01:12:06.314 --> 01:12:08.950
- I'm worried about you.
- Leave me alone.


1133
01:12:10.651 --> 01:12:13.118
- I just want to try...
- I know what you want!

All right? And I cannot bear
your concern,

was and never will be.

about

Yeah. Slaves, uh,
fleeing north to Canada

were often helped, fed, hidden

was the dominee, the minister
here at First Reformed.


1247
01:26:10.857 --> 01:26:13.157
And he was very active
in the Abolitionist Movement.


1248
01:26:13.159 --> 01:26:15.160
He assisted in...

1249
01:26:15.162 --> 01:26:16.963
No. Miss Suriya,
let me try this.


1250
01:26:17.230 --> 01:26:19.029
Uh, why don't you all stand up
for a second?


1251
01:26:19.031 --> 01:26:20.098
Take a look right here.

1252
01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:21.899
Do you see one part of wood
that seems different


1253
01:26:21.901 --> 01:26:23.104
than the other part
of the wood?


1254
01:26:23.704 --> 01:26:24.138
KIDS: Yeah!

1255
01:26:25.004 --> 01:26:25.672
You all see that, don't you?

1256
01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:27.074
But does this seem
a little bit


1257
01:26:27.973 --> 01:26:29.674
- like a secret door? Hmm?
- KIDS: Yes.


1258
01:26:29.676 --> 01:26:31.041
- Yeah. What's your name?
- Benny.


1259
01:26:31.043 --> 01:26:32.676
Benny, will you give me
a hand?


1260
01:26:32.678 --> 01:26:34.112
- Come on over here.
- Mmm-hmm.


1261
01:26:34.114 --> 01:26:36.147
You see, there used to be
a pew over this.


1262
01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:38.517
And they would move it, and
then they would lift this up.


1263
01:26:38.519 --> 01:26:40.120
Can you do it? Help me.

1264
01:26:41.154 --> 01:26:43.287
Yes! Oh!

1265

Sometimes whole families.

Can you imagine that?

1269
01:26:52.266 --> 01:26:55.703
In the dark. The air hot,

1270
01:26:56.602 --> 01:26:57.637
shaking with fear.

1271
01:26:58.872 --> 01:27:00.106
The sound of the slave
hunter's horses outside.


1272

On their knees,
holding each other's hands,

your sister sometime.

- If I'm invited. I'd love to.


1279
01:27:26.165 --> 01:27:28.265
- You gonna visit me?
- I would, yeah.


1280
01:27:28.267 --> 01:27:30.238
I'd love to meet Michael Jr.

1281
01:27:31.137 --> 01:27:33.039
You've been such a help to me.

1282
01:27:33.906 --> 01:27:35.639
My great-grandfather

1283
01:27:35.641 --> 01:27:37.642
was a pastor
in Muskegon, Michigan.


1284
01:27:37.644 --> 01:27:39.243
The Saint of God.

1285
01:27:39.245 --> 01:27:41.912
And, uh, the bank in town
was a two-story building,


1286
01:27:41.914 --> 01:27:43.283
the first building
to have an elevator.


1287
01:27:44.016 --> 01:27:45.285
And one Monday,

1288
01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:48.953
Granddad, uh,
got the boys all together


1289
01:27:48.955 --> 01:27:51.288
and they went into town
to deposit church funds,


1290
01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:53.190
as they did every Monday.

1291
01:27:53.192 --> 01:27:55.126
And they needed to go talk
to the managers.


1292
01:27:55.128 --> 01:27:56.661
They got on the elevator.

1293
01:27:56.663 --> 01:27:58.065
And he had a heart attack.

1294
01:27:59.365 --> 01:28:01.933
And he... He took off his hat.

1295
01:28:01.935 --> 01:28:03.201
Apparently he always
wore a hat.


1296
01:28:03.203 --> 01:28:05.103
And he took off his hat
and he said,


1297
01:28:05.105 --> 01:28:07.875
"Boys, take off my shoes.

1298
01:28:08.141 --> 01:28:10.111
"I'm standing on Holy Ground."

1299
01:28:11.144 --> 01:28:12.111
And then he died.

1300
01:28:13.879 --> 01:28:16.182
Somewhere between
the first and second floor.


1301
01:28:18.718 --> 01:28:22.155
Um, I think about that story
when I think about Michael.

he was standing

I think we're supposed to look

1400
01:36:29.141 --> 01:36:31.742
with the eyes of Jesus
into every living...


1401
01:36:31.744 --> 01:36:33.810
You don't live
in the real world.


1402
01:36:33.812 --> 01:36:36.680
You don't.
You, you are a minister


1403
01:36:36.682 --> 01:36:38.549
at a tourist church
that no one attends.


1404
01:36:38.551 --> 01:36:41.853
Do you have any idea what
it takes to do God's work?


1405
01:36:41.855 --> 01:36:43.057
I'm trying to...

1406
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:46.256
To, to maintain a mission
of this size?


1407
01:36:46.258 --> 01:36:48.826
The staffing, the outreach,

1408
01:36:48.828 --> 01:36:51.265
the amount of people
that we touch each day.


1409
01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:54.467
Who's that priest
that you like so much?


1410
01:36:55.467 --> 01:36:57.434
- Thomas Merton?
- Thomas Merton. He didn't live


1411
01:36:57.436 --> 01:36:59.170
- in the real world either!
- Yes, he did! He would...


1412
01:36:59.172 --> 01:37:01.171
No. He was a monk who lived

1413
01:37:01.173 --> 01:37:03.508
in a monastery in Kentucky
and wrote books!


1414
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:05.742
Well, somebody has
to do something!


1415
01:37:05.744 --> 01:37:07.812
It's the Earth that hangs
in the balance.


1416
01:37:07.814 --> 01:37:11.248
Well what if this is His plan?
What if we just can't see it?


1417
01:37:11.250 --> 01:37:13.617
You think God wants
to destroy his creation?


1418
01:37:13.619 --> 01:37:15.421
He did once.

1419
01:37:15.788 --> 01:37:18.292
For 40 days and 40 nights.

1420
01:37:25.765 --> 01:37:29.733
Look, Abundant Life,
we're with you.


1421
01:37:29.735 --> 01:37:31.935
Okay? We care.

1422
01:37:31.937 --> 01:37:35.609
We do. And I know,
this is a hard time for you.


1423
01:37:36.342 --> 01:37:38.479
But we're gonna help you
with that.


1424
01:37:39.345 --> 01:37:41.912
Once we get through
the reconsecration service,


1425
01:37:41.914 --> 01:37:44.118
you, you need to go to rehab.

1426
01:37:44.516 --> 01:37:47.487
You need to go check yourself
into a medical institution.


1427
01:37:48.354 --> 01:37:50.787
All right?
Maybe go to Nicaragua


1428
01:37:50.789 --> 01:37:53.424
and preach the gospel
or build houses.


1429
01:37:53.426 --> 01:37:56.163
But do something
in the real world.


1430
01:37:56.361 --> 01:37:58.295
And if you can't
do the ceremony,


1431
01:37:58.297 --> 01:37:59.663
I'll understand that.

1432
01:37:59.665 --> 01:38:01.431
You're expected to be there,
but look.


1433
01:38:01.433 --> 01:38:03.201
We can just say that
you were sick, which is true.


1434
01:38:03.203 --> 01:38:04.338
No. No. It's not...

1435
01:38:05.571 --> 01:38:07.371
It's not about the ceremony.
All right? I can... I will...


1436
01:38:07.373 --> 01:38:09.239
I... I want to be there.
I have to be there.


1437
01:38:09.241 --> 01:38:11.576
It's my church.
It's 250 years.


1438
01:38:11.578 --> 01:38:14.515
I want to be there. I want
to introduce you. Please?


1439
01:38:16.716 --> 01:38:19.450
Well, Ed Balq has decided

1440
01:38:19.452 --> 01:38:21.251
that he would like
to make comments,


1441
01:38:21.253 --> 01:38:22.987
so the Governor
will introduce him.


1442
01:38:22.989 --> 01:38:24.455
Will that be a problem?

1443
01:38:24.457 --> 01:38:27.227
Not at all. Not at all.

1444
01:38:27.827 --> 01:38:29.796
Well good. Good.

1445
01:38:31.364 --> 01:38:33.930
Listen. We'll get through
this reconsecration.


1446
01:38:33.932 --> 01:38:35.636
It'll be special.

1447
01:38:36.002 --> 01:38:38.672
And then we'll deal
with these other issues.


1448
01:38:44.444 --> 01:38:45.579
