00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.310
HIT THE ROAD

2
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.270
Written and directed
by Panah Panahi


3
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.590
Where are we?

4
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.870
We're dead!

5
00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.710
Give it to me.

6
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.310
Right now!

7
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.430
Give you what, dear mother?

8
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.870
- Give it to her, punk.
- What?


9
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.830
- The cell.
- I don't get it.


10
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.150
- That's enough.
- The cell phone.


11
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.670
Give you what?
I don't get you.


12
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.430
- The cell. Is he deaf?
- Shush!


13
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.870
- I didn't bring the cell.
- Shush!


14
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.550
Little piece of shit.

15
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.950
Didn't I command you not to bring it?

16
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.350
- You commanded?
- Sure, I did.


17
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.310
Search him.

18
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.670
Where did you hide it?

19
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.790
Don't move.

20
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.710
Who commanded what?

21
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.270
Why are you searching me?

22
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.150
I must know!
Who commanded what?


23
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.510
I need to know!

24
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.110
Open the door, kick him out.
He's lying, I can't stand it.


25
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.030
Get out!

26
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.070
Let's take off your pants.

27
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.710
- No, not my pants!
- Search his pants.


28
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.790
Ok, I'll give it to you.

29
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.630
Hurry up.

30
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.790
You can have it.
Was it really worth it?


31
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.150
Abandoning your child!

32
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.270
Little piece of shit.
You hid it there?


33
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.070
Warm and dry!

34
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.310
What are you up to?

35
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.550
- Why are you taking it out?
- Keep him still!


36
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:20.710
Sit down.

37
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.830
Why?

38
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.270
Why?

39
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.910
Scissors?

40
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.590
She cut it!

41
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.230
Calm down!

42
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.070
It's the SIM card, not your willy.

43
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.190
Why shout and wriggle?
Can't stand him.


44
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.710
What to do with it?

45
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.630
Should I swallow it?

46
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.470
Maybe he should...

47
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.790
These two...

48
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.830
Where are you taking it?

49
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.990
We'll pick it up on our way back.

50
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.710
If anything happens to my phone...

51
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.310
Shut up.
Just remember where she hid it.


52
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.830
Mom has disappeared.

53
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.310
Stay or I'll gobble you up.

54
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.710
It's really expensive!

55
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.430
Let me be!

56
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.790
Let me be!

57
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.030
Let me be.

58
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.150
Don't destroy the borrowed car.

59
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.150
Mind your own business.

60
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.590
Asshole!

61
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.230
If I don't answer my calls,
many people will worry.


62
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.270
I have serious matters to take care of.

63
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.430
Who worries about you, little fart?

64
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.070
Everybody, hundreds of people.

65
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.350
People you don't know.

66
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.190
It's really annoying.

67
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.590
Who are these friends
who worry about you?


68
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.310
Who worries about you more
than your father


69
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.830
more than your mother,

70
00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.550
your sister,

71
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.270
your uncle

72
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.430
or even your cousin's sister-in-law?

73
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.270
The brother-in-law of the wife
of your paternal uncle...


74
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.910
Who worries about you?

75
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.830
You don't know everything.

76
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.510
Enlighten me.

77
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.310
Madam Fakhrayi, she's the worrying type.

78
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.390
She's 40. Not a bit old for you?

79
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.670
Not the mother, the daughter.

80
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.590
The chubby bear,
what was her name again?


81
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.430
She's no bear, she's a gazelle.

82
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.830
If she's a gazelle it's damn serious.

83
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.150
It's very serious. We worked out
all the details. We're getting married.


84
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.950
Don't you deserve better than

85
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.550
Little Miss Four
-Eyes?

86
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.190
Plus, her father's gonna
kick your ass.


87
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.310
He wouldn't dare! 
You wouldn't let him!

88
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.830
You have a broken-legged dad,
and a fuck-up brother...


89
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.310
Right. I'll kick him myself.

90
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.430
And all of you
if my phone is damaged.

91
00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.030
Wait!

92
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.750
You can't go there. Let's go.

93
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.470
- Let go of me.
- Let's go.


94
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.390
Get in the car.

95
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.350
I don't want to, 
I'm too anxious.

96
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.190
- Let me go.
- Don't move!


97
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:14.870
OK, breathe.

98
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.910
You'll remember the place?

99
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.070
Sure, I covered it with a stone.

100
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.350
How will we find the cell if,
God forbid,


101
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.750
something happens to you?

102
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.270
Thank you, God, for this scenery.

103
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.310
Idiot!

104
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.590
Stop kissing the ground!

105
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.590
Sorry...

106
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.710
You have dust all over you.

107
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.510
- Looks like pistachios!
- Dear boy!


108
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.030
- Beautiful!
- And there, a cake.


109
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.350
And there, like frogs.

110
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.150
A pair of frogs.

111
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.590
And there, a lion's head.

112
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.430
Or the Sphinx with riddles.

113
00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.990
Stunning!

114
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.350
- Which one?
- Over there.


115
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:04.750
- Where?
- There.


116
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:35.430
Careful!

117
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:40.910
Belt!

118
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.790
Rear mirror!

119
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.390
Side mirror!

120
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.350
Handbrake!

121
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.270
Clutch!

122
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.190
Gear!

123
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.590
Blinker!

124
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.110
Onwards!

125
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.470
I feel sad

126
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.710
and depressed.

127
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:39.030
If Miss Fakhrayi calls
and I don't answer,


128
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:40.550
she'll break up with me.

129
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.390
Who's gonna be accountable?

130
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.110
Are you blind?

131
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.270
You should have changed your glasses
"in extremis"?


132
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.470
No one answers me?

133
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.510
What is "in extremis"?

134
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.910
Mister, would you be accountable?

135
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.030
Would you, dear lady?

136
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.870
Or you, Mister Shithead?

137
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.310
Calm down sweetheart!

138
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.230
These two grown-ups listened
without protesting.


139
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.550
No cell phones!

140
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.310
Dad, Jessy seems tired.

141
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.030
This is the Urmia lake.
Well, it was. Once.


142
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:32.870
Years ago, we would swim in it.

143
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.470
Nowadays, you can only have a dust bath.

144
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.590
Even better! We don't get wet.

145
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.950
Here you are. Done.

146
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.710
Good, good!

147
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.470
Well done!

148
00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.350
Thank you.

149
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:02.710
Let me see...

150
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:04.750
What the hell!

151
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.750
Can't be cleaned.

152
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.310
Do you know how much it costs?

153
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:10.590
Not much, I know the prices.

154
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.270
First your brother and now you.

155
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.550
You're ruining me.

156
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:16.710
Let go of me.

157
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.030
He destroyed the car.

158
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.030
We can clean it later.
We're being followed.


159
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:23.550
What did you say?

160
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.670
We're being followed.

161
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.190
Got it!

162
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.030
Why are you staring at me then?

163
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:32.710
I thought you were not done talking.

164
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.270
We're being followed.

165
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:35.870
Cool, we're being followed.

166
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.790
Act normal.

167
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:38.990
Is he alone?

168
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.670
Turn around and see for yourself.

169
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.110
I'm telling you to act normal,
and you tell me to turn and look?


170
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.390
Jessy!

171
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:49.270
Go hide.
The bad guys are here.


172
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:50.630
Park next to that car.

173
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.830
Over there, with the others.

174
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.510
Act casually.

175
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.230
- Give me a tissue.
- It's the engine coolant!


176
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:14.790
Ignore him.

177
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:20.470
It's gas!

178
00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.670
There must be a leak.

179
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.030
It's the coolant!

180
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.830
I was signaling you.
Your tank is leaking gas.


181
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.750
Get up! Pass the antenna.

182
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.630
Ok, ok. Thanks!

183
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.710
Thanks, go ahead.

184
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.310
Take Jessy for a pee.

185
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.590
Get out!

186
00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.470
Where is he going?

187
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.390
Wait, come here!

188
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.910
Take Jessy for a pee.

189
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.110
Take him yourself.

190
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.670
No, you have to do it.

191
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.070
I'm busy.

192
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.030
Wait a second.

193
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.030
It's the coolant!

194
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.190
Take him to pee.

195
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.310
Behind the tree.

196
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.030
This way.

197
00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.910
Come Jessy.

198
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:33.230
He's right.
There is a leak under the car.


199
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:52.190
Dad, take him.

200
00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.750
Take him dad!

201
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.390
Give him to me.

202
00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:01.110
It's the coolant!

203
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.510
Don't look there! It's gas.

204
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.030
Thanks a lot.

205
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.270
Let me talk...

206
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.510
What do you want, kid?

207
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.630
Mister, could you come closer?

208
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:24.030
You come closer! 
Don't break anything.

209
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.990
Sorry, Rahman.

210
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:31.070
Do you have a first-class
second-hand cell?


211
00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.030
What! Bullshit!
Get out, kid.


212
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:37.030
Rahman, give me all your surplus in gas.

213
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.430
I've got the clients.

214
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.351
- I'll take care of it. Fast and easy!
- How much for these?


215
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:46.190
No worries.
Not a gas leak but the coolant.


216
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.030
Get away from the road!

217
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.910
I told you it's the coolant.

218
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.310
- When?
- You weren't listening.


219
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:02.110
Belt!

220
00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:04.670
Little fart.

221
00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.310
Rear mirror!

222
00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:09.990
Blinker!

223
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.430
Told you

224
00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.830
Told you that being angry is a sin

225
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:32.510
My eyes are on the road you took

226
00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.310
I'm begging you

227
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:38.110
I can die for you
but please don't play hard to get


228
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:42.990
With your black eyes
don't play hard to get


229
00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.590
Life is short

230
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.070
Like a dream

231
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.630
This too shall pass

232
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.190
Make peace

233
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.710
Spring will blossom again

234
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.470
And will drown us in flowers

235
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:16.190
Told you, told you,
Being angry is a sin...


236
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.870
Damn it!

237
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.870
I'm not a kid anymore.

238
00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.350
Changing things "in extremis"?

239
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.350
Shut up! Not in front of the kid!

240
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.350
I'm feeling fine.

241
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:32.351
- But you undermine me with these stupidities.
- What's he talking about?


242
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.110
Whenever people say "in extremis"
something bad happens.


243
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.830
Nonsense. "In extremis"
is not a bad word. Don't you worry.


244
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.070
Is bro going somewhere?

245
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.470
He's gonna get married.

246
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:44.910
Who would marry him?

247
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:46.630
Lots of morons around.

248
00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:49.350
We wanna elope.

249
00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.550
Don't! You'll get caught.

250
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.110
No bad omens, please!

251
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.310
I have a bad feeling...

252
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.190
He'll be back soon.

253
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.550
Oh my God! Look, the cyclists.

254
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:02.310
Oh yes.

255
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.670
Great!

256
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:04.990
Hello there.

257
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:06.830
Athletes, heroes, celebrities.

258
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:10.950
Oh, he fell.

259
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:13.670
What happened?

260
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:18.790
Don't stop.

261
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:20.190
Go.

262
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.030
Mister, are you ok?

263
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:23.510
I'm sure he's fine.

264
00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:25.190
Mister, did you die?

265
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:27.950
Are you dead?

266
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.550
Get going.

267
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:31.710
He's crying!

268
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.990
If he's crying, he's fine.

269
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.630
Where are you going?

270
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.190
Monkey face!

271
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.390
Stay in the car!

272
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.070
See if the car is scratched.

273
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:50.510
Take this and stop crying.

274
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.190
I'm not crying, my leg hurts.

275
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:55.310
I was in the middle of a race.

276
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.990
Can you drop me at the infirmary?

277
00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.750
Wipe your tears, first.

278
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.470
I'm not crying.

279
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.590
Don't tease him.
Leave him alone.


280
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.990
Is it a national competition?

281
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:12.550
Where are the caretakers,
that follow you on bikes?


282
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:16.590
It's not an official competition.
We're practicing for the Grand National.


283
00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:21.270
But we've set up
a prize for the winner.

284
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.270
Could you move a little?

285
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:27.350
- How much is the prize?
- We put in 60,000 each.


286
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:29.670
- How many are you?
- 30.


287
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:32.310
This makes for a prize of 180 million?

288
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:33.790
18 million.

289
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.350
1 million and 800, you geniuses!

290
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.550
You might say goodbye to cycling now.

291
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:40.790
Nonsense!

292
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:44.150
Armstrong stayed the world champion
with cancer.


293
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:47.230
He's my role model
in life and in sport.

294
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:48.790
His name says it all:

295
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.510
Arm. Strong.

296
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:55.550
If only I could see him up close
and kiss his hands, his legs...


297
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.470
He was into doping, though.

298
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.390
It's a known fact.

299
00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:03.550
They took back all his medals
and threw him out like trash.


300
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:04.990
From where?

301
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:08.830
The Cycling Federation I guess.

302
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.830
He was dismissed as a dishonest prick

303
00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:15.510
and it was aired on TV.

304
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.030
Fake news!

305
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.710
No, listen to me...

306
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:24.470
He confessed in front of the cameras.

307
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:27.590
That he cheated.

308
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:31.590
With his tail between his legs.

309
00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:33.910
And gave back his medals.

310
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.750
Fine, he cheated.

311
00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:39.470
He was a champion for ten years but

312
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.990
didn't he become rich?
Didn't he get a wife?


313
00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:44.870
So one can't get a wife without medals?

314
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.790
I guess I was a Tour de France champion
and I didn't know...


315
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.430
Listen man,

316
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:55.190
don't play devil's advocate,

317
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:58.350
and live an honest life.

318
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:00.390
Bravo, that's my man!

319
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.950
Now a prayer for the father.

320
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:06.390
Peace be upon Mohammad

321
00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:11.270
and his Holy Family.

322
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.590
Please, have this cucumber.

323
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.390
Don't! He gets sick.

324
00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:17.270
Have some pistachios.

325
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.390
- What are you doing?
- I want to give him something.


326
00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.030
What a zoo! Give him all we have!

327
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:25.870
I should have won the competition.

328
00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:30.030
An athlete has to concentrate on sport,

329
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.510
not on cheating or on doping.

330
00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.230
Sorry,
the pistachios fell on the ground.


331
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:38.870
- It's ok, leave it.
- Move your foot!


332
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.470
Look! Your friends!

333
00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.070
It's dirty. Leave it.

334
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:51.830
One should not cheat!

335
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.470
She's right, it's dirty, leave it.

336
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:58.550
Haven't you ever cheated in your life?
Done anything illegal?


337
00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:00.750
Then found an excuse?

338
00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.590
Well, lately I decided
for my elder son...


339
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:04.870
Shush.

340
00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:08.070
We all have a block

341
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.230
for our transgressions.

342
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:12.390
Our mind just stops

343
00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:14.630
all self-reflection.

344
00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:18.030
Why? Because we're sure
we're good people.


345
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:19.670
And it's true.

346
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.030
We are good people,

347
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:24.270
but we protect ourselves,

348
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:28.190
and a filter helps us to forget.
Pushing it all into the unconscious.


349
00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:32.390
The unconscious doesn't always talk...

350
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.310
I can't express myself well enough
in Farsi.


351
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:38.030
I'd be more comfortable in Azari.

352
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:40.190
Leave it, it's dirty.

353
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:42.950
It's the birds share.

354
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:44.110
What do you want?

355
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.350
- Can I drink from your thermos?
- You're killing me.


356
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.830
An athlete who talks about
serious matters is a rare specimen.


357
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:52.190
Thank you, well, I myself...

358
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:53.590
You memorized it, right?

359
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:56.510
I was saying, I
have a BA in sociology.

360
00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:58.990
Shit!

361
00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:00.670
Why did you give him this?

362
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.270
He might have an infection or something.

363
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:05.510
Swear to God, I don't have any sickness.

364
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:06.910
Here you are.

365
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:09.870
I'll fill it up with Red Bull.

366
00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:13.670
I'll get off here. Thanks.

367
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:15.270
Thanks, Mr. Driver.

368
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:17.870
Why are you giving him that?

369
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.270
There is no infirmary here!

370
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.510
There we are.

371
00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:25.790
My house is nearby.

372
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.110
- I don't see any house around here.
- Thank you.


373
00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:31.270
- Take your bike.
- Thanks for everything.


374
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:32.430
Be strong.

375
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:35.830
- Thanks.
- See you.


376
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.630
Why don't you close that?

377
00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.590
You could have done it.

378
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.430
Take Jessy for a pee.

379
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:43.790
Why don't you take him?

380
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.550
Your dog is really cute.

381
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:49.230
- You want him?
- No thanks.


382
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.350
He has a serious infection
and he's dying.


383
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:56.670
And this stupid dad picked him up
in the street.


384
00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:58.790
Our son is quite sensitive,

385
00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.990
and now he might see him die.

386
00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:05.790
Well, you should have put him down
by the vet, poor thing.


387
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:09.550
He was supposed to do that,

388
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:12.030
but the dog was at our door again.

389
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:15.910
We'll keep the kid busy, you take Jessy
and leave him somewhere.


390
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.590
Even if I was willing,
and I'm not,


391
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.950
what would you tell your son
if I did that?


392
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:22.190
That you stole him!

393
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:25.550
- Seriously? No!
- I'm going.


394
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:29.590
Thank you all. 
Thank you, too.

395
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.110
Thanks, bye.

396
00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:34.870
We hit him and he thanks us.

397
00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:36.990
He's a good man.

398
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.750
Couldn't you shut up
in front of the kid?


399
00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.590
I lost it for a moment.

400
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.190
Sorry.

401
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:45.350
No pee-pee yet?

402
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:49.470
I can't look at Jessy.
I feel bad for him.


403
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:53.150
Weren't you supposed
to take him to the vet?


404
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.710
And put him down?

405
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:58.150
With this broken leg?

406
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:59.830
I sent Ahmadian.

407
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:02.030
You told me a detailed story:

408
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:05.910
while putting him down, the whole place
got covered with shit and urine.


409
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:09.270
The nurse cried her heart out.

410
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:13.270
Ahmadian's story! 
Not my vocabulary!

411
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:16.670
You said that you saw Jessy die
with your own eyes.


412
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:19.070
What is he doing over there?

413
00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:20.510
I'll take care of it.

414
00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.470
Step on it! No daydreaming!

415
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:42.710
Let them spend some time together.

416
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:44.390
Pee together...

417
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.230
We won't stop again.

418
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:52.030
Any wild beasts around?

419
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:53.950
Go get them.

420
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:57.470
The only two wild beasts here,
are these two.


421
00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.230
No worries.

422
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:02.230
Plus, what can I do with this leg?

423
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:05.310
You piss me off with this leg.

424
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.350
What can I do?

425
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:11.670
Khosro.

426
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:15.670
I'm losing it.

427
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.590
What next?

428
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.670
Is the guy reliable?

429
00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:26.790
I told you a hundred times.
Houshang is a stand-up guy.


430
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:29.870
We lost our house and my car too.

431
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:33.550
For him to be able to leave.

432
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.190
All I have is
you and the little mouse.

433
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:39.870
Do you ever think about the future?

434
00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:42.590
The future?
I'm already drowning in it!


435
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:43.750
What do you mean?

436
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.510
Once out of the country,

437
00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:49.310
he'll work hard.

438
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.550
He'll buy a house

439
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.870
and we'll be reunited.

440
00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:55.190
Him, seriously?

441
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.590
Stop it! That's enough!

442
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.990
Ok, but him?

443
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.750
Every morning,

444
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.430
with my camera, 
I immortalized

445
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:36.230
your artistic pee.

446
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:43.310
I found it last night

447
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:47.270
and brought it as a souvenir.

448
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:51.670
It's quite a collection.

449
00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.590
Abroad, this would be a huge success

450
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:56.750
in an art gallery.

451
00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:58.430
I have no doubt.

452
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:02.390
And they would call it,

453
00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:06.710
"My Son's Creations: The Pees of Farid".

454
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.750
Or: "Which country's map is this?"

455
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:12.990
We are two brothers

456
00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.430
Smarter than the others

457
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:17.990
We pee every night

458
00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.510
And we spray it just right

459
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.150
We pee in a bottle

460
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.950
We pee on Asia

461
00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:28.390
We pee on Africa

462
00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:31.390
We pee on Europe, if we get there

463
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:36.310
To the health of my bro and me!

464
00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:09.270
Father!

465
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.950
Dad, come here.

466
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.790
Let me tie him up.

467
00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:18.430
I can't hold it anymore.

468
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:19.870
Coming.

469
00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:22.830
What's that on your head?

470
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:26.350
Is that Mom's scarf?
She'll get upset...


471
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.310
Explain it to me please?

472
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:31.830
Leave me alone, 
I have a toothache.

473
00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:41.950
Once there, try to smoke less.

474
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.070
You smoke too much.

475
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:47.110
Not much.

476
00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:50.870
You smoke too much while watching movies.
Don't watch movies.


477
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:53.430
Fine, I won't.

478
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.390
What's the world's best movie, for you?

479
00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:05.270
The world's best movie?

480
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:06.950
Whatever...

481
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:09.110
What kind of question is that?

482
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:12.470
For once, give me a straight answer.

483
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:14.470
And don't jerk me around.

484
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:17.390
A Space Odyssey.

485
00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:18.870
Is it beautiful?

486
00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:20.830
Mesmerizing!

487
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:22.350
You know...

488
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:25.750
it's very zen.

489
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.230
Calms you down.

490
00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:30.910
Takes you deep into the galaxies.

491
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:34.670
Always wars in the galaxies!
How can it calm you down?


492
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:37.110
- Not always!
- I don't get you men.


493
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:38.630
There is no war in it.

494
00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.390
Thank God.

495
00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:43.550
We pray to God the Almighty

496
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:51.710
The Milky Way Galaxy!

497
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:54.190
The Milky Way Galaxy?

498
00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:57.590
What happens at the end?

499
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:58.790
At the end,

500
00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:02.310
the hero is alone, in a spaceship.

501
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:04.990
And he goes deep into a black hole.

502
00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:08.070
He goes deeper and deeper.

503
00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:12.310
That's all you see for half an hour.

504
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:16.270
Crossing the limits of time and space.

505
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:17.750
Don't go!

506
00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:21.190
Don't go!

507
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.310
Son, don't go!

508
00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:30.590
Dad! Father! Papa!

509
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.310
Damn it! What?

510
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:33.950
Which song?

511
00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:36.110
Any damn song.

512
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:40.270
Thank you for encouraging me.

513
00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.430
Most welcome.

514
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.630
Do what you have to do.
It will be highly appreciated.


515
00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:47.390
Sir, are you in the queue?

516
00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:52.630
Hello, Houshang!

517
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:54.670
It's me, Khosro.

518
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:59.230
What's up? No, still on the road.

519
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:17.870
The deed for the house?

520
00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:20.350
Hold on! It's out of my hands.

521
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:24.590
My problem, not yours.

522
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.190
I'll take care of the deed later.

523
00:33:44.614 --> 00:33:47.075
I'm the fucking boss of the Middle East.

524
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.270
The fucking boss.

525
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:08.830
Not done yet?

526
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:11.430
Haven't even begun!
I was just singing.


527
00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:13.710
You heard him, hasn't begun, yet.

528
00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:16.270
I wasn't queuing for a concert!

529
00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:19.070
Talk to you later,
on this number.


530
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.390
Bye, Houshang.

531
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.510
Don't talk!

532
00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:32.390
Just sing.

533
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:35.030
And take your time.

534
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:39.390
Good boy.

535
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:06.910
You are my everything

536
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:10.910
Without you I can't breathe

537
00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:15.430
I can't live without you

538
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:28.110
Mister!

539
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:29.550
Light?

540
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:20.150
You're my everything

541
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:24.270
Without you I can't breathe

542
00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:28.670
With you I have everything,

543
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:32.590
Everything

544
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:37.590
And no other needs

545
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:39.030
Is he dead?

546
00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:19.510
What the hell?

547
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:23.230
- Just cutting a lock of hair.
- Why don't you leave me alone?


548
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:26.830
You lunatics. Go back home.

549
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:28.430
Home?

550
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:31.670
You're the lunatic. Unbelievable!

551
00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:32.830
Shit-face!

552
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:34.470
Let's go.

553
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:36.550
- Where to?
- To the shit-hole!


554
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.710
Jessy, what are you up to?

555
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:54.470
Are you ok?

556
00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:01.350
Why run like that?
It's not good for you.


557
00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:04.310
Are you listening?

558
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:07.070
Makes you die sooner.

559
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:09.470
Then what to say to the boy?

560
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:15.310
God, that idiot husband of mine...

561
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:19.510
He was supposed to put you down.

562
00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:23.590
I'm not even sure about his leg.

563
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:28.710
Four months in a cast?

564
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:30.710
There he is.

565
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:33.390
I want to hold Jessy.

566
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:36.190
Stay inside or I'll kick your butt.

567
00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:38.150
I'm not in the mood.

568
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.910
- She's not in the mood.
- Give him to me.


569
00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:43.750
You leashed him to a disposable chair?

570
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:45.990
A plastic chair.

571
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.270
There was a pile of those.

572
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:50.950
- Disposable...
- Plastic!


573
00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:54.270
You're busting my chops! Take him.

574
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:56.350
Jessy salutes you!

575
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:59.270
Hello Jessy, how are you dear?

576
00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.190
Why did you ruin my hair?

577
00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:03.390
Was just a lock of hair,
not your willy.


578
00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:06.190
- Jessy is asking about your health.
- I'm fine.


579
00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:08.510
- Seat belt!
- I didn't even remove it.


580
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.550
- Rear mirror.
- Didn't touch it.


581
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:12.750
Don't talk back to your stupid dad!

582
00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:48.550
Wait!

583
00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:58.310
Hello.

584
00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:00.710
How are you?

585
00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:02.710
Where the hell are you?

586
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:05.190
Come and choose one for God sake!

587
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:09.870
Unbelievable!

588
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:14.950
Hello sir, what happened to you?

589
00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:16.590
Are you ill?

590
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.470
I fell.

591
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:19.830
From where?

592
00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:21.710
From grace.

593
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:24.110
Your leg is hurt too?

594
00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:26.990
Are you a doctor? I fell...

595
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:30.790
They told us to buy a sheepskin.

596
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:34.110
Would be nice to know

597
00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:35.630
where the hell to go.

598
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:37.390
Do you have a traveller?

599
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:38.910
Yes!

600
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:40.990
Did you choose the sheepskin?

601
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:44.110
They aren't dry yet?

602
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:47.470
The last person chose for you

603
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:50.230
and you will choose for the next.

604
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:52.350
It's a tradition.

605
00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:54.990
It's a good cover!

606
00:41:58.070 --> 00:41:59.750
I choose that one.

607
00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:01.310
Which one?

608
00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:03.150
That white one.

609
00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:05.870
White is no good for hiding.

610
00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:08.630
The next person will get into trouble.

611
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.590
I want that one.

612
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:14.190
Are you sure?

613
00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:16.230
Yes. I'm not choosing a wife.

614
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:17.870
I said what had to be said.

615
00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:22.390
Where the hell are you?

616
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.710
We've been waiting for ages...

617
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:27.670
Give him the signal.

618
00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:30.590
Step on it. Wasting our time...

619
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:32.550
Why is he taking so long?

620
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:35.310
Make the signal with your damn cap.

621
00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:37.750
How should I know?

622
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:40.230
Whirl it around, let him see you.

623
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:42.830
Yes, that's the way!

624
00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:45.590
Faster.

625
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:48.950
You're making them sweat.

626
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:53.470
You're asking me?
Do it with your red panties!


627
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:55.310
Let's see if this works.

628
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:57.310
I'm not seeing him.

629
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:58.590
Mister!

630
00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:01.270
Fine, he's coming.

631
00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:28.990
He's here! He's here!

632
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:33.390
Good God!

633
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:34.990
Who's this?

634
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:36.550
Who's the traveller?

635
00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:39.670
Sheepskin?

636
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:42.110
Why are you so late?

637
00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:45.750
Don't bust my chops. 
I almost fell.

638
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:47.910
You old fart, go sell your sheepskin.

639
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:52.190
What's it to you?

640
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:55.110
- No cellphone, right?
- No, swear to God.


641
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:58.990
Take this road and come straight
to the Hassan Ali Kandi junction.


642
00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:00.910
I'll be waiting for you in the village.

643
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:03.470
Why don't you show some respect?

644
00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:04.710
Go to hell.

645
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:06.310
Mister! Junction...

646
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:12.470
Get lost!

647
00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:30.390
Daddy!

648
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:38.510
Dad!

649
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:40.470
What was all that about?

650
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:46.030
Wasn't he Batman's enemy, the Scarecrow?

651
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:50.030
Remember in the movie,

652
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:53.830
he arrives in a cloud of fear gas

653
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:58.230
and people see spiders everywhere.

654
00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:00.030
Shut up.

655
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:13.230
I don't get it.

656
00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:17.390
Charging the full price
for just the skin?


657
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:20.790
Hasn't he already milked us enough?

658
00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:24.030
Plus paying for a whole sheep!

659
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:26.950
They're pushing it!

660
00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:31.830
I know his kind!

661
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:48.390
- Is it here?
- To the right.


662
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:54.190
Couldn't you ask right or left,

663
00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:57.590
when he was giving

664
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:59.030
direction?

665
00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:00.510
Why didn't you?

666
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:04.070
It didn't need a leg!
Just an open mouth.


667
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:06.590
I wasn't close, he couldn't hear me.

668
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:08.630
Yes, right there.

669
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:10.430
Just admit you didn't think of it.

670
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:13.150
What is my bro up to? I'm bored.

671
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:16.550
Bizarre!

672
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:21.630
He must have suspected that
we planned to eat him.


673
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:24.710
You really wanna eat him?

674
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:27.470
Yes. Last night's decision.

675
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:29.670
Was I sleeping?

676
00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:31.230
Probably.

677
00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:35.710
But I think his meat is bitter.

678
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:38.430
His ears are great for a kebab grill.

679
00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:41.390
Especially a grill on a hill.

680
00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:44.590
His meat is sweet and yummy.

681
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:49.590
Even the baby cockroach is the apple
of his mum's eye.


682
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:51.430
Don't let him fool you.

683
00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:53.510
He's just teasing you.

684
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:56.070
Mum I wasn't fooled.

685
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:57.790
Right!

686
00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:01.070
I was fooled!

687
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:03.070
Dad, are we cockroaches?

688
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:05.950
We are now!

689
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:09.510
- Here, right?
- Yes, yes.


690
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:13.150
Give me a hug.
We're going to eat you tonight!


691
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:16.070
I'm not a child anymore!

692
00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:19.230
Cool!

693
00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:25.510
Call your monkey brother.

694
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:31.510
Bro!

695
00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:35.270
Come back!

696
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:45.590
Where were you Monkey The First?

697
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:48.150
Where were you?

698
00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:50.430
I went to the right side

699
00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:52.950
but it's a U-turn.

700
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:55.670
- Are you sure?
- Yes.


701
00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:01.470
- What is this?
- It's Hassan Ali Kandi's sign.


702
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:03.190
Why did you take it?

703
00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:05.750
It was already on the ground.

704
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:08.870
I was looking for directions.

705
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:11.990
- Did you find the way?
- No.


706
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:14.510
Why are you happy, then?

707
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:15.630
Wait, Mister.

708
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:17.230
Do I look happy?

709
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:19.030
Mister! Stop!

710
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:22.230
Wait.

711
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:24.670
Thanks.

712
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:27.070
Hello, how are you?

713
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:30.510
Do you know
where the "Kandi" village is?


714
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:33.710
You won't find it on your own,
follow me.


715
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:35.870
We don't want to bother you.

716
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:39.150
He says we can follow him.

717
00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:41.310
Get off.

718
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:43.310
I'm staying.

719
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:44.470
Sorry.

720
00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:47.750
No problem, let him be.

721
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:49.390
Follow me, it's on my way.

722
00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:50.870
Thanks a lot.

723
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:52.030
Sure, good riddance.

724
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:53.910
Sorry, he is trouble.

725
00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:56.310
Sorry ma'am.

726
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:59.350
Just warn them that he's an idiot!

727
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:44.150
What a relief, what calm!

728
00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:46.910
Now I can sleep.

729
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:49.110
Wow!

730
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:52.870
Good God!

731
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:55.310
What are we doing?

732
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:59.270
I was suffocating, because of the kid.

733
00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:01.990
We should have told him.

734
00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:07.470
What an education we're giving him.
All lies!


735
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:09.510
Nothing but lies.

736
00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:14.390
He would have exposed us

737
00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:16.470
a hundred times...

738
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:18.470
I pity the people on the bus,

739
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:21.390
he is probably driving them crazy.

740
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:24.350
Well, what are you going to tell him?

741
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:27.590
Nothing.

742
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:31.950
That you're married
and have to run away


743
00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:33.990
and join your bride.

744
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:36.070
And you'll be back soon.

745
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:37.710
Anyhow, he's a lively kid.

746
00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:40.990
He won't be sad for long.

747
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:46.670
What about you guys?
Are you gonna stay sad for long?


748
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:49.270
Of course not.
It's going to be fine.


749
00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:53.590
It's going to be fine.

750
00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:56.830
We'll laugh at this one day.

751
00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:00.550
Seriously?

752
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:08.390
What is there to laugh about?

753
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:11.630
I begged you

754
00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:13.950
not to talk about separation

755
00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:15.630
and not to cry, during this trip.

756
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:19.390
It breaks my heart
to see you like this.

757
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:23.630
Let me go reassured,
knowing that you'll be fine.


758
00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:27.470
I cried because of a sad memory.

759
00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:30.230
Nothing to do with you leaving.

760
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:33.510
Why would I mess up your mood?

761
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:35.510
Nonsense.

762
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:38.510
Don't tailgate the minibus.
It's suffocating us.


763
00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:45.070
Your husband told me to stay close
not to lose him.


764
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:48.670
Now, her husband tells you
not to tailgate the damned minibus.


765
00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:49.950
You're such an ass.

766
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:19.750
That little devil is so cute.

767
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:31.270
Hello, villagers!

768
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:34.110
Can't you shut up?

769
00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:36.510
Why are you hitting me?

770
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:38.830
- I didn't.
- What did I do?


771
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:40.270
It was a joke.

772
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:42.510
I don't appreciate your jokes.

773
00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:44.830
- Hello, you have a traveller?
- Yes...


774
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:46.470
- Please...
- What?


775
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:49.830
Please go behind the coffee shop.

776
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:54.470
Remember who you're looking for,
Hassan-Ali The Third.


777
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:56.630
Hassan
-Ali The Third.

778
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:59.590
Well!

779
00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:01.630
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead!


780
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:03.390
Get going.

781
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:08.750
Where is bro going?
I go with him.


782
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:11.550
Look at this cute calf.
He looks exactly like you.


783
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:13.390
He's really cute.

784
00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:16.190
- Do you want to make friends?
- Yes.


785
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:24.070
Do we look suspicious?

786
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:27.830
No, you worry too much.

787
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:30.150
I am worried...

788
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:32.070
What could happen to him?

789
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:33.350
Left, left.

790
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:39.350
We did our research.
Houshang is a stand-up guy.


791
00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:43.990
Why did you let him go alone?
Go with him.


792
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:48.150
At his age I started a family.

793
00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:52.030
Now you worry that he's by himself?

794
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:54.030
Ok, I'll go, I'll go.

795
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:05.470
Don't try to be funny.

796
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:07.910
No fingers in his eyes!

797
00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:15.830
Halt!

798
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:19.830
- God damn it! I'll kick your ass!
- Why are you here?


799
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:21.710
They all saw you.

800
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:23.710
So what?

801
00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:27.190
Your lovely mother ordered me
to join you.


802
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:29.950
He asked us to wait here.

803
00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:32.110
- The hell with him.
- What?


804
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:34.750
I don't like the guy.

805
00:56:36.550 --> 00:56:39.070
You know where to go?

806
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:40.230
What?

807
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:43.270
Were you always like this?

808
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:45.230
Like what exactly?

809
00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:47.830
Where to go?

810
00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:49.550
Okay, okay!

811
00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:51.030
God damn it!

812
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:54.550
Another 2 km

813
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:56.710
and then wait
at the end of the road.


814
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:58.710
After an hour
they'll come to pick us up.


815
00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:05.670
- Where are you going?
- Come.


816
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:08.190
Didn't they say
when you'll hit the road?


817
00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:10.390
They said...

818
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:13.550
First we're put in "quarantine".

819
00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:15.670
Then, when the time comes

820
00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:19.150
we'll meet again

821
00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:21.110
to say goodbye.

822
00:57:22.310 --> 00:57:25.430
It might take another 2 to 3 days.
You should go back home.


823
00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:26.950
Shut up.

824
00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:29.950
Don't you know your mother?
Leave you here?


825
00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:32.750
She won't let go
until you get to the border.


826
00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:35.870
If they don't see me
they leave without me.


827
00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:37.710
They wouldn't dare.

828
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:40.790
Didn't they say in an hour?

829
00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:43.470
Come, sit here.

830
00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:46.710
Relax!

831
00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:54.070
I'm stressed.

832
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:57.470
Stressed! Stressed!

833
00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:01.430
Stressed.

834
00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:34.990
Bring me that apple.

835
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:48.670
The other one too.

836
00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:02.950
Wash them.

837
00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:18.070
Whenever you kill a cockroach,

838
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:20.710
don't throw him in the toilet.

839
00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:23.990
His parents sent him abroad,

840
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:27.830
with lots of hope.

841
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:30.470
I see...

842
00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:34.110
And don't whine in front of your mom.
She'll be heartbroken.


843
00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:36.350
I know! That's why I was careful.

844
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:38.510
You were careful?

845
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:40.190
How many times did I catch you?

846
00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:42.830
I'll be more careful.

847
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:48.950
One doesn't cry
in front of one's mother.


848
00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:52.990
But in front of one's father...

849
00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:02.830
You expect me to
cry in front of you?

850
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:04.670
No.

851
01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:09.710
But I give you permission
if you'd like to.


852
01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:14.990
Kind of you. Thanks.

853
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:22.350
If you wanna know your friend,

854
01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:24.510
ask him to share an apple with you!

855
01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:27.710
And see if he
gives you the bigger half.

856
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:38.790
Monkey face, let me finish my sentence.

857
01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:43.950
There...

858
01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:46.550
Don't you see?

859
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:48.590
You took the bigger half.

860
01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:50.790
Are you blind?

861
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:52.950
Give it to me.

862
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:57.070
Ok, ok.

863
01:00:57.230 --> 01:01:00.430
Which half should I take
for our friendship to last?


864
01:01:01.070 --> 01:01:02.550
Too late.

865
01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:04.910
Forget it.

866
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:22.190
It tastes like eggs.

867
01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:25.550
We have to go dad.

868
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:28.110
Eat it.

869
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:30.470
You'll be less stressed.

870
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:48.150
Don't be afraid of anything.

871
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:54.070
Those who leave on a boat
should be afraid.


872
01:01:55.870 --> 01:02:00.070
Not you. Houshang is waiting for you
on the other side.


873
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:01.630
No fear!

874
01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:03.190
Don't be scared. Ever.

875
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:17.150
I'm worried about your house
that you put up for my bail.


876
01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:34.550
What about me?

877
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:37.710
Your crazy brother? Or your poor mom?
Don't we matter?


878
01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:39.350
Sure you do, I...

879
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:41.590
Don't talk with your mouth full.

880
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:43.910
I have been saying this for 2 decades.

881
01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:45.790
Ok, ok.

882
01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:02.590
What was I saying?

883
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:06.110
- That you worry about the house.
- Right.


884
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:08.390
I'm worried about it.

885
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:14.070
So?

886
01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:17.030
Why do you always repeat yourself?

887
01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:19.670
I asked you what about us?

888
01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:22.430
Me, your crazy brother, your mom?

889
01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:25.710
And what was my answer?

890
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:30.470
Are you serious
or are you pulling my leg?


891
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:32.470
Me, making fun of you?

892
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:35.030
Why would you think that?

893
01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:39.150
Ok, I'm reassured.

894
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:50.990
Mom is not here, drop the act!

895
01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:55.430
You don't believe that my tooth hurts?

896
01:03:55.590 --> 01:03:56.990
Let me see it.

897
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:03.870
Which one?

898
01:04:07.030 --> 01:04:09.990
- It's really in bad shape.
- I told you.


899
01:04:10.550 --> 01:04:13.350
Please go to the dentist

900
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:15.470
once you're in Tehran.

901
01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:18.430
And stop venting to mom.

902
01:04:43.310 --> 01:04:47.590
It's been a long time
since we last talked like this.


903
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:58.550
Thanks for your support.

904
01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:01.030
Shut up.

905
01:05:10.070 --> 01:05:11.070
Done deal.

906
01:05:11.110 --> 01:05:13.710
Great, tied to a tree,

907
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:16.630
time for a yummy barbecue

908
01:05:16.790 --> 01:05:20.030
out of Monkey the 2nd.

909
01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:22.830
What did he say?

910
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:24.230
Who's the traveller?

911
01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:28.070
Nothing, he's asking for direction.

912
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:29.710
He's lost.

913
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:32.150
Cool, kebab time!

914
01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:38.630
Good day, sir!

915
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:40.430
We don't have a cell phone

916
01:05:40.590 --> 01:05:43.510
and we've been discrete on the road.

917
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:46.030
I asked you to be discrete.

918
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:48.070
I insisted that he come alone.

919
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:50.590
His dad was worried.

920
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:51.990
He kept his distance.

921
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:53.270
No bad intentions.

922
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:55.790
Your address sucked.

923
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:58.670
You didn't say which side to take
at the crossroad.


924
01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:00.950
And we had to buy

925
01:06:01.110 --> 01:06:03.230
the whole sheep.

926
01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:04.430
Ok, let's go.

927
01:06:04.590 --> 01:06:05.790
Right now?

928
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:07.070
Khosro!

929
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:14.030
I'll take him to quarantine.

930
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:16.830
You can say goodbye in two days.

931
01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:18.790
You should have told us before.

932
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:20.190
Wait.

933
01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:22.350
Dad, untie me.

934
01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:23.710
I'm coming.

935
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:26.550
Let me see if I
can hunt you from afar.

936
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:29.030
Here you are: the sheepskin

937
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:31.230
and his bag.

938
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:34.630
This bag is too big,
it's going to expose us.


939
01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:37.110
- I'll change it.
- Don't make a fuss.


940
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:39.870
Ok, I'll change it.

941
01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:47.470
They take him to quarantine,

942
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:49.430
and bring him back in a few days,

943
01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:51.990
to say goodbye.

944
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:53.630
Mom!

945
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:54.710
Shut up!

946
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:56.630
Come and free me.

947
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:59.870
Mom, come and untie me.

948
01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:10.670
Untie me.

949
01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:12.990
Mom, untie me.

950
01:07:16.310 --> 01:07:17.710
Help!

951
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:19.310
Why can't he shut up?

952
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:21.470
He's annoying.

953
01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:24.670
I'm thirsty, I'm hungry.

954
01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:34.470
Take this money

955
01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:36.990
and provide a correct address.

956
01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:38.950
Don't confuse us this time.

957
01:07:39.110 --> 01:07:42.310
I'll tell you where to camp.

958
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:44.470
I'm thirsty.

959
01:07:45.070 --> 01:07:48.030
Gosh, I forgot something.

960
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:50.830
What is it?

961
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:53.870
A hat and a shawl.

962
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:58.030
Listen,

963
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:59.790
don't worry.

964
01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:03.350
Go now

965
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:05.750
and come back to say goodbye.

966
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:07.190
Ok?

967
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:10.430
Hurry up, we're late.

968
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:15.790
Stop shouting!

969
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:16.950
Untie me.

970
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:18.790
Don't worry,

971
01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:21.630
Houshang is a stand-up guy.

972
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:23.870
A real one!

973
01:08:24.150 --> 01:08:25.830
When are you coming back?

974
01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:30.110
Nothing, nothing.

975
01:08:35.230 --> 01:08:36.390
Bro!

976
01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:38.510
I'll keep him busy.

977
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:40.950
Where is bro going?

978
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:43.990
Wait, wait.

979
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:46.190
Two minutes!

980
01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:49.310
My kid is going to catch cold.

981
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:51.310
Take care.

982
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:52.950
Ok, my boy?

983
01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:56.030
Wait, wait.

984
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:57.630
Wrap it around you.

985
01:08:58.350 --> 01:09:01.030
Where are you taking my boy?

986
01:09:04.230 --> 01:09:05.630
Wait...

987
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:20.870
Take the dog, I can't hold him anymore.

988
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:22.670
Son, hold the tailgate.

989
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:25.990
Come on, good dog.
Bravo!


990
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:36.110
Are you holding it?

991
01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:37.830
Hello.

992
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:41.470
Hi, how are you?

993
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:45.390
What a beautiful girl. 
What's your name?

994
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:48.310
- Mobina.
- Nice.


995
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:50.390
Beautiful hair.

996
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:52.350
Yes, very.

997
01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:55.710
You'll get tired like this.

998
01:10:56.190 --> 01:10:59.190
Press this and it gets blocked.

999
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:02.110
Interesting.

1000
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:03.470
You have the same car?

1001
01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:06.270
No, but I think they all have this.

1002
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:08.230
- Thank you so much.
- Most welcome.


1003
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:11.070
- Can I help you?
- No thanks.


1004
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:17.190
Mobina dear,
can you show the kid around?


1005
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:19.190
- Yes, sure.
- That's nice.


1006
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:23.070
- Can we take the dog too?
- No, he's sick.


1007
01:11:23.230 --> 01:11:25.590
Go ahead dear boy.

1008
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:28.230
My husband has one broken leg
and two broken hands.


1009
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:32.910
- What's wrong with him?
- He's weak. Don't you see?


1010
01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:36.310
He was always like that.

1011
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:39.270
- So beautiful.
- Yes.


1012
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:41.510
Is this the great bear?

1013
01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:44.790
God what did you create?
You're the Almighty.


1014
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:47.750
A starry night!

1015
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:50.590
How do you feed him?

1016
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:51.870
The little one gives him...

1017
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:53.510
Don't kiss the ground.

1018
01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:55.070
Chips.

1019
01:11:55.230 --> 01:11:57.430
I'll smash your head
if you kiss the ground.


1020
01:11:57.590 --> 01:12:00.470
Feed chips to a dog?

1021
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:04.350
- I'm sorry. I regret it.
- Don't.


1022
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:07.470
It's sleeping time.

1023
01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:11.790
He was like family.

1024
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:16.390
How many are you?

1025
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:19.150
5 including the one that left.

1026
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:23.350
Don't lie on the ground.

1027
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:25.670
It's cold.

1028
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:27.790
- Dad?
- Yes?


1029
01:12:28.190 --> 01:12:30.190
Where is Farid?

1030
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:32.390
Farid!

1031
01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:38.070
Farid leaped!

1032
01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:43.430
He went off-roading.

1033
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:46.430
He comes back tomorrow, right?

1034
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:49.510
- God willing.
- Turn it off.


1035
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:53.950
What is this?

1036
01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:55.870
Ask him.

1037
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:58.990
- Mister, what is this?
- Headlamp, dear.


1038
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:03.870
When is he coming? Be precise.

1039
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:09.470
Not tonight.

1040
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:13.830
Maybe tomorrow.

1041
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:18.470
And maybe
the day after tomorrow.


1042
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:21.630
Mister, is it original?

1043
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:23.870
Nothing is original anymore.

1044
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:25.430
How much is it?

1045
01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:26.750
Expensive.

1046
01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:31.830
Maybe the day after tomorrow...

1047
01:13:32.710 --> 01:13:34.310
What time?

1048
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:37.870
Mister, I can't move easily.

1049
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:40.750
When you leave, give
the dog to my wife

1050
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:42.150
Sure.

1051
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:44.830
What time?

1052
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:47.950
Goodbye then.

1053
01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:50.470
Nine thirty!

1054
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:52.990
Goodnight.

1055
01:13:53.150 --> 01:13:55.350
Ten thirty...

1056
01:13:57.110 --> 01:14:01.550
Eleven thirty, maybe...

1057
01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:03.790
Where would he go after off-roading?

1058
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:05.470
Twelve thirty.

1059
01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:07.430
After off-roading?

1060
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:10.590
After leaping? Oh dear!

1061
01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:12.870
Look over there!

1062
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:16.830
Look at the sky! Look!

1063
01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:20.070
Where is my bro?

1064
01:14:20.710 --> 01:14:23.390
I have to tell you something.

1065
01:14:24.190 --> 01:14:27.070
He went to get a beautiful wife.

1066
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:30.870
I asked him to bring a Batman mask,
when he returns.


1067
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:32.950
An original one.

1068
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:35.470
Couldn't find it here.

1069
01:14:35.630 --> 01:14:37.390
Will he meet Batman?

1070
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:38.830
Sure.

1071
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:41.070
If he's smart enough,

1072
01:14:41.230 --> 01:14:44.190
he'll get an appointment.

1073
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:47.910
And if he's even smarter,
he'll make it on a Sunday.


1074
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:50.310
Because Sunday is a holiday.

1075
01:14:50.710 --> 01:14:53.870
But Superman doesn't help people!

1076
01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:57.110
Not on Sundays, Mondays or Tuesdays...
He's very lazy.


1077
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:59.310
He's a bum.

1078
01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:01.470
He's not even a superhero!

1079
01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:03.870
He's an ass.

1080
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:09.070
I have a question though.

1081
01:15:09.230 --> 01:15:10.270
Would Batman

1082
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:13.470
give him his car for a ride?

1083
01:15:13.630 --> 01:15:15.590
He's not crazy, you know.

1084
01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:18.510
Give that expensive car

1085
01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:21.910
to your blind brother?
To crash it?


1086
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:23.310
Not in this life.

1087
01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:24.950
He's not crazy.

1088
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:30.590
That car doesn't get destroyed,
not even with a rocket.


1089
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:32.590
Cool wheels.

1090
01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:35.750
It's a fabulous car with a fridge,
a PlayStation


1091
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:38.390
and a fantastic sound system.

1092
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:40.030
And a sixth gear

1093
01:15:40.190 --> 01:15:42.070
to fly.

1094
01:15:42.230 --> 01:15:43.710
- Really?
- Sure.


1095
01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:47.470
So, that damn car
must be quite expensive.


1096
01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:51.430
You can't find it on the market

1097
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:54.270
but I did some math,

1098
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:56.990
and I found out the car's price.

1099
01:15:57.150 --> 01:15:59.750
Bravo. How much was it in our currency?

1100
01:16:01.710 --> 01:16:04.030
I don't know it in our money

1101
01:16:04.190 --> 01:16:07.550
and I don't have my notebook.
But I know the price in dollars.


1102
01:16:07.710 --> 01:16:08.870
How much?

1103
01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:11.350
600 million dollars.

1104
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:15.990
600 million dollars?

1105
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:17.910
Too much.

1106
01:16:19.150 --> 01:16:22.550
If his expensive car gets scratched,

1107
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:24.430
the motherless Batman,

1108
01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:27.870
will snap.

1109
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:31.150
He will sit in
the middle of the road

1110
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:33.110
and shout:

1111
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:34.390
Oh God!

1112
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:35.990
You mean he'll be devastated?

1113
01:16:36.150 --> 01:16:39.470
Yes and cry, cry and cry.

1114
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:42.390
People will ask him what has happened.

1115
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:44.470
He'll show them the scratch.

1116
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:46.350
And then,

1117
01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:50.990
they'll start crying, too.

1118
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:54.110
He'll cry his heart out.

1119
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:58.030
And a blind man
will pass by and ask:

1120
01:16:58.550 --> 01:17:01.950
I hear lamenting, weeping and moaning.
What is it all about?


1121
01:17:03.190 --> 01:17:05.710
He'll ask him to come closer

1122
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:09.110
and touch the car.

1123
01:17:10.150 --> 01:17:12.910
He touches the scratch...

1124
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:14.510
What did you say earlier?

1125
01:17:14.670 --> 01:17:16.190
- Voo?
- Wow!


1126
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:17.350
Wowwwww.

1127
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:25.150
And he'll start crying too,
weeping and moaning.


1128
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:28.750
And Batman,

1129
01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:31.030
in the middle of all that

1130
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:33.030
will shout "Oh, my car is",

1131
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:35.030
"scratched."

1132
01:17:37.670 --> 01:17:40.790
"Oh my car is scratched, scratched."

1133
01:17:49.390 --> 01:17:51.870
"Oh, my car is scratched."

1134
01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:55.910
Now it's only worth 500 million dollars.

1135
01:17:59.670 --> 01:18:02.350
500 million dollars, only.

1136
01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:23.830
They are here.

1137
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:07.870
We were supposed to see them before...

1138
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:09.870
We couldn't say goodbye!

1139
01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:13.430
Khosro!

1140
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:22.430
Khosro!

1141
01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:56.590
My son is gone.

1142
01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:21.590
It's so beautiful.

1143
01:20:22.030 --> 01:20:23.590
Here we go again.

1144
01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:43.870
You, naughty ones,
you're early risers now?


1145
01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:46.270
Well, yes.

1146
01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:51.710
How are you?

1147
01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:55.670
See that cute lady?

1148
01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:56.870
Yep.

1149
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:59.190
What was it that you used to say?
"Jolie"...


1150
01:20:59.350 --> 01:21:01.350
"Jolie" girl?

1151
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:04.030
Yes. Go tell her.

1152
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:07.150
Take the bread.

1153
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:08.750
It's a beautiful spot too.

1154
01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:10.590
Sure, go.

1155
01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:14.390
Both the lady and the spot
are beautiful.


1156
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:25.310
- "Jolie" girl.
- You are my love.


1157
01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:27.150
- My love...
- Yes?


1158
01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:30.430
This new girlfriend of yours
is much prettier than Miss Fakhrayi.


1159
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:33.030
- Yep.
- Go, play with her.


1160
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:35.870
Go, she's over there.

1161
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.990
Wow!

1162
01:23:23.230 --> 01:23:27.350
I saw my love leaving me.

1163
01:23:28.830 --> 01:23:32.630
And the color on my cheeks fading

1164
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:38.750
I'm caught in the stormy
sea of love


1165
01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:44.310
My love is leaving me
on Noah's Ark


1166
01:23:45.630 --> 01:23:47.750
What a mood I am in!

1167
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:49.870
I'm homesick

1168
01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:51.990
in this foreign land

1169
01:23:52.150 --> 01:23:53.990
God is all I have

1170
01:23:54.150 --> 01:23:56.190
What a mood I am in

1171
01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:58.430
I'm homesick

1172
01:23:58.590 --> 01:24:00.430
In this foreign land

1173
01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:02.790
God is all I have

1174
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:07.190
Who can hear the pain
of my broken heart


1175
01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:12.590
What can I sing
with my tired voice


1176
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:18.470
I miss my homeland

1177
01:24:20.230 --> 01:24:24.030
What can I do, my love is there

1178
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:27.710
What a mood I'm in!

1179
01:24:27.870 --> 01:24:29.830
I'm homesick

1180
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:32.270
In this foreign land

1181
01:24:32.430 --> 01:24:34.510
My dear!

1182
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:37.430
You are my love.

1183
01:24:39.390 --> 01:24:40.790
I love you!

1184
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:46.710
Jessy, come here.

1185
01:24:47.150 --> 01:24:48.470
Jessy!

1186
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:50.270
Dad! Check Jessy out!

1187
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:53.110
Jessy's not feeling well!

1188
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:56.070
Mom! Dad... Jessy's not feeling well!

1189
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:58.030
Jessy!

1190
01:25:34.230 --> 01:25:37.030
My dear tribesman

1191
01:25:37.190 --> 01:25:39.470
You are riding happily

1192
01:25:39.630 --> 01:25:41.590
The horse of foreign lands

1193
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:45.070
Proudly

1194
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:50.510
In this country

1195
01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:53.230
You the noble man

1196
01:25:53.710 --> 01:25:59.550
You were the last one standing
But you broke, too


1197
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:06.430
Thirsty and believing in thirst

1198
01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:10.950
Pride was the name of our love

1199
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:13.750
What you gave away to the wind

1200
01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:20.510
Was all we had

1201
01:26:28.150 --> 01:26:32.950
Which autumn called you

1202
01:26:33.310 --> 01:26:37.750
You the lost soul

1203
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:41.710
With its magic voice

1204
01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:46.390
For you to leave us so bravely

1205
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:50.670
Stay with me as I'm waiting

1206
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:55.230
Sadly for spring

1207
01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:59.470
Stay with me

1208
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:04.230
Together, we can
bring back the sun again


1209
01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:15.710
Thousands of birds

1210
01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:17.990
In love like you

1211
01:27:18.510 --> 01:27:24.470
Crossed the night in hope of daylight

1212
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:29.230
They were gone not to return

1213
01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:31.830
Until dawn

1214
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:38.550
Not to return till this day

1215
01:27:40.190 --> 01:27:42.350
God be with you

1216
01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:44.910
Tired of darkness

1217
01:27:45.070 --> 01:27:47.230
But leaving isn't

1218
01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:49.550
The answer to the pain

1219
01:27:49.710 --> 01:27:51.790
You took the road

1220
01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:54.310
toward sunset

1221
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:56.750
And not toward sunrise

1222
01:27:56.910 --> 01:28:00.390
It's getting dark, come back
