cassette you think you have?

- Yeah,

928
01:00:44.373 --> 01:00:47.042
that's from one
of the very first.

We started in the
wrong direction,


934
01:01:20.576 --> 01:01:23.745
then you play an old
recording on a new player,

Antique cassette!
One track runs backwards.

01:01:33.297 --> 01:01:35.857
The other track has probably later
been recorded on another deck.

- [Rollins] Let's see if I can
find that cassette for you,


940
01:01:38.969 --> 01:01:43.473
'cause I know I have it
around here somewhere.


941
01:01:43.682 --> 01:01:49.771
I lost the box and the j-card
of this particular cassette,


942
01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:51.732
but, so I had
to make a new one,

943
01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.901
and it says, it's titled,
"extremely old tape.“


944
01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:59.990
this is my first ever cassette,

945
01:02:00.198 --> 01:02:02.576
and I would make
album tapes with this


946
01:02:02.784 --> 01:02:05.787
by putting the tape recorder
up to my mother's speaker,


947
01:02:05.996 --> 01:02:07.581
"I guess this will sound okay,"

948
01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:09.958
and you hear cars
going by, dogs barking,


949
01:02:10.167 --> 01:02:12.487
you know, I try and play it on
the school bus the next day,

01:02:12.586 --> 01:02:14.338
everyone, "god, this sucks."

951
01:02:14.546 --> 01:02:19.801
So this is from, like, 1970
something, so this is tape one.

About two years ago
I was on a train,


957
01:03:02.344 --> 01:03:04.971
I was on at the r-train
with my headphones,


958
01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:07.724
listening, and nobody
paid me no mind,


959
01:03:07.933 --> 01:03:10.894
so I open up my cassette
player, I flip the cassette


960
01:03:11.103 --> 01:03:15.607
and it falls on the
ground on an r-train,


961
01:03:15.816 --> 01:03:19.069
it was like, it was
like I defecated

in the middle of the
car, everybody was like.

know what that is used for?

- Walkie-talkie?
- [Buzzer buzzes]

- I have no idea what it is.

967

- Wait, wait, wait, it's
a cassette player, right?


968
01:03:42.342 --> 01:03:45.345
- Ah, this is a rip off,
because you want to listen,


969
01:03:45.554 --> 01:03:47.764
but you can't, because you
don't have any headphones.

"whoa, something
that can play music


973

"and I can carry it around,
if I have a large pocket."

demonstrate your model.

the volume, hmm,

loud, as loud as possible,

981

984
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:57.793
people would record that and
then, if your man wanted it,


985
01:04:58.001 --> 01:05:00.212
you were gonna get a
double cassette recorder


986
01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:03.131
and go from one cassette
to another cassette,


987
01:05:03.381 --> 01:05:05.300
and then now he has
that, and he's like,


988
01:05:05.509 --> 01:05:09.805
"yo," his man wants it,
so now he's gonna take

that second generation cassette

990

sounds even worse,

it, now I got like,

cassette tape music,


1010
01:06:29.509 --> 01:06:34.639
it seems more relative in a
way to the human condition,


1011
01:06:34.848 --> 01:06:36.641
because our bodies
are not digital,


1012

we're not robots, and your
body feels different every day

sloppy, it's dirty,

it's marked the way a

it passes through,

it wears those scars
and those scuffs,
