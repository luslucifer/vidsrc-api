[woman] It's been said that,
according to Greek mythology,


12
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.861
humans were originally created
with four arms, four legs,

and a head with two faces.

14
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.570
But fearing their power,
Zeus split them into two separate parts,

00:00:49.653 --> 00:00:52.778
condemning humans
to spend the rest of their lives

their soul's equal.

never really been easy,

but modern dating online is even harder.

that maybe I should give up altogether,

00:01:39.028 --> 00:01:41.986
along comes Ted, a Libra who likes puppies

33
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.028
and offers to take
me on a sunset sail

But on a positive note,

36
00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:56.403
I've turned my horrible love life
into a successful online writing career.


37
00:01:56.903 --> 00:01:59.611
For years,
I've been chronicling my disaster dates


38
00:01:59.695 --> 00:02:02.278
under the pseudonym "Always a Bridesmaid."

39
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:05.278
And people seem to love
that I can't find love.


40
00:02:06.153 --> 00:02:09.611
But honestly, I'm not sure
how much longer I can do this.


41
00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:13.111
How is it that everyone
has found the one, and I haven't?


42
00:02:13.195 --> 00:02:15.528
Either I'm the unluckiest woman
in the world,


43
00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:18.320
or my picker is broken.

44
00:02:19.153 --> 00:02:20.070
It's both.

45
00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:23.986
What's the one common denominator
in all of these dates?


46
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.903
It's you.

47
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.903
I beg your pardon?

48
00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:30.028
The common denominator
is that it's a bunch of LA assholes.


49
00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:32.486
That's your other problem.
You're only looking local.


50

I had to import Mark from Ohio,
for God's sakes.

You gotta think bigger.

Jesus, Nat! You only have
your dating radius set to five miles.

00:02:40.236 --> 00:02:41.861
You gotta look outside West Hollywood.

54
00:02:41.945 --> 00:02:43.861
Gas is so expensive.

55
00:02:43.945 --> 00:02:47.945
I mean, it'd be 40 bucks to get
to Glendale, and that's only one way.


56
00:02:48.486 --> 00:02:51.153
It's cheaper to do cocaine
and then run everywhere.

-Okay. Fixed it.

Want something?

59
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.903
Ooh yeah, uh, grab me a Green Latifah
with an extra shot of wheatgrass.


60
00:02:57.986 --> 00:03:00.778
-Oh, but no kiwi because I'm--
-I… I know, you're allergic. No kiwi.


61
00:03:00.861 --> 00:03:02.570
Sorry. Habit.

62
00:03:02.653 --> 00:03:05.736
The last time an intern forgot,
I almost died.


63
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.945
Natalie, where's my next story?
I'm assuming your next date is lined up.


64
00:03:11.028 --> 00:03:13.903
I was thinking for the next one,
maybe we'll try something different. Like…


65
00:03:13.986 --> 00:03:16.736
Something a little bit more upbeat?

66
00:03:17.236 --> 00:03:18.570
Why the hell would you do that?

67
00:03:18.653 --> 00:03:20.278
So I don't spend another evening

68
00:03:20.361 --> 00:03:22.861
with a guy who was featured
on an episode of Hoarders.

from their own lives,

00:03:32.986 --> 00:03:35.903
or to show them that things could be,
you know, so, so much worse.

So how do you really feel about
my favorite Christmas movie?

[Natalie] It's a movie about people
falling in love based on how they look.

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:01.820
I had my profile up for a year,
and guess how many matches I got.


605
00:30:02.695 --> 00:30:03.528
Three.

606
00:30:03.611 --> 00:30:06.403
And one of them
was my old English teacher.


607
00:30:06.486 --> 00:30:08.903
She's 70 now, and she has a pacemaker.

608
00:30:08.986 --> 00:30:11.611
Having sex with her
would literally kill her.


609
00:30:12.778 --> 00:30:14.153
So just as an experiment,

610
00:30:14.236 --> 00:30:17.695
I thought I could use a picture
of a standard hot guy


611
00:30:17.778 --> 00:30:21.070
and see what would happen.
I got 85 matches in five minutes.


612
00:30:21.153 --> 00:30:23.153
So, apparently, there's plenty
of girls out there.


613
00:30:23.236 --> 00:30:24.528
They just didn't want to date me.

614
00:30:24.611 --> 00:30:27.611
Are you seriously
looking for sympathy right now?


615
00:30:27.695 --> 00:30:30.278
There are no words for what you did.

616
00:30:30.361 --> 00:30:31.945
-Well, I would--
-No words!


617
00:30:32.861 --> 00:30:35.278
But a deal's a deal.
So let's just move on.


618
00:30:46.445 --> 00:30:47.320
Okay.

619
00:30:51.695 --> 00:30:53.653
[Barb] And you had
to write the words on your hand.

-[Josh laughing]
-He keeps taking his glove off.


621
00:30:55.736 --> 00:30:56.903
His hands are freezing.

622
00:30:56.986 --> 00:30:59.861
I… I… I thought your finger
was gonna fall off, Dad, for sure!

-Natalie!
-Oh.

Come on in, come on.
Join us for breakfast. We just sat down.


625
00:31:05.278 --> 00:31:08.695
Um, I actually should probably go shower.

626
00:31:08.778 --> 00:31:11.320
Oh, I'm sure you look
absolutely beautiful.


627
00:31:11.403 --> 00:31:13.736
But full disclosure, 
I can't see shit.

628
00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:14.778

Please, sit.

Wow, this all looks so delicious.

Oh, please, help yourself to anything.

rush off to last night?

-Oh, we went to McGregor's for karaoke.
-Mm-hmm.

People used to fall in and out of love
based solely upon the written word.

00:31:56.361 --> 00:31:59.195

651

So, Natalie, what was it about Josh
that first caught your eye?

Gee, I mean, um…

There was just so many
unbelievable things in his profile.


655
00:32:14.695 --> 00:32:19.153
His photos. I took one look at that hair,
that unique physique.

Uh, I mean, that jawline. [scoffs]

657
00:32:21.986 --> 00:32:24.445
I thought to myself,
"It's too good to be true."


658
00:32:24.528 --> 00:32:25.486
Oh no, it's true.

659
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:27.611
He's gotten more chiseled
in the last couple of years.


660
00:32:27.695 --> 00:32:31.236
Oh, but it wasn't just the photos
that ensnared me.


661
00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.945
His bio. He's passionate about life,

662
00:32:34.028 --> 00:32:35.778
loves all things outdoors.

663
00:32:35.861 --> 00:32:38.570
-Oh hey. He mentioned the store.

-Oh, but it's so fascinating.

And all the travel that it must involve.

Well, if you count

00:36:43.528 --> 00:36:44.570
You climb?

756
00:36:45.236 --> 00:36:49.320
Me? [scoffs] Do I climb?
I'll climb anything that moves.


757
00:36:51.861 --> 00:36:53.236
I'm an aggro.

758
00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.861
-Aggro?
-Yeah, like aggressive. Aggro. [growls]


759
00:36:56.945 --> 00:37:00.820
An aggressive climber.
I climb all kinds of things like


760
00:37:01.445 --> 00:37:05.861
ladders, um, houses, um, trees,

761
00:37:05.945 --> 00:37:07.028
ladders…

762
00:37:08.736 --> 00:37:10.070
Mostly ladders. [chuckles]

763
00:37:10.153 --> 00:37:10.986
That's cool.

764
00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:13.945
Um, a few of us are climbing
at Rock Ventures tomorrow.


765
00:37:14.028 --> 00:37:14.861
Wanna join?

766
00:37:14.945 --> 00:37:17.028
Hell yeah! Let's do it.

767
00:37:17.111 --> 00:37:17.945
-Great.
-Mm-hmm.


768
00:37:18.028 --> 00:37:19.695
-10:00 a.m.?
-Perfect.


769
00:37:19.778 --> 00:37:22.403
Um. Well, hey, it was nice
to meet you, Natalie.


770
00:37:22.486 --> 00:37:24.653
-I'll see you guys at 10:00 a.m.
-See you, bro.


771
00:37:25.236 --> 00:37:27.028
Climb you later! [chuckles]

772
00:37:29.403 --> 00:37:30.320
Savage?

773
00:37:30.403 --> 00:37:31.778
Gnarly?

774
00:37:31.861 --> 00:37:33.195
Aggro?

775
00:37:33.278 --> 00:37:35.236
You're the one who told me
to look up the lingo!


776
00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.611
Yeah. Real words like
"rappel" and "harness."


777
00:37:37.695 --> 00:37:39.403
You sound like
you got Millennial Tourette's!


778
00:37:39.486 --> 00:37:42.236
Well, you know what?
We've got bigger problems.


779
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:46.486
I once broke my toe climbing out of bed.
How am I gonna climb a wall?


780
00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:50.195
I can teach you right here.
I mean, how bad could you possibly be?


781
00:37:50.695 --> 00:37:51.820
[screaming]

782
00:37:51.903 --> 00:37:54.195
-[Josh] All right. Come down!
-[panting] I can't hold on!


783
00:37:54.278 --> 00:37:57.153
-[laughing] Here. Here. Come on.
-[Natalie whimpering]


784
00:37:57.236 --> 00:37:59.778
[exhales deeply] Sweet baby Jesus.

785
00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:07.028
The key is to not focus on the wall,
but to focus on your first move.


786
00:38:07.111 --> 00:38:08.070
Here, look at this.

787
00:38:08.153 --> 00:38:11.236
And then, your second. Okay?

788
00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.278
Onto your third.

789
00:38:13.861 --> 00:38:18.153
See, great things are done by a series
of small things brought together.


790
00:38:19.778 --> 00:38:20.903
-[Natalie] Hmm?
-Whew.


791
00:38:20.986 --> 00:38:22.736
That's actually very insightful.

792
00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.945
Van Gogh.
Feel free to use it on Tag sometime.


793
00:38:26.028 --> 00:38:27.111
Any questions?

794
00:38:27.195 --> 00:38:28.861
What was he like in high school?

795
00:38:28.945 --> 00:38:30.278
Exactly what you'd expect.

796
00:38:30.361 --> 00:38:34.153
Class president, prom king,
star of the football team.


797
00:38:34.736 --> 00:38:36.528
Why did you stop being friends?

798
00:38:36.611 --> 00:38:38.736
[sighs] Because he got popular.

799
00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:40.653
And you?

800
00:38:41.278 --> 00:38:42.153
Didn't.

801
00:38:43.736 --> 00:38:44.820
[door chimes]

802
00:38:46.278 --> 00:38:48.028
-Go ahead, come on.
-[clears throat]


803
00:38:49.861 --> 00:38:51.778
[exhales] Full disclosure,

804
00:38:52.778 --> 00:38:54.986
I was kind of
a late bloomer too. [grunts]

805
00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:56.861
I find that very hard to believe.

806
00:38:57.528 --> 00:39:00.611
Yeah, well,
If it wasn't for Invisalign and Accutane,


807
00:39:00.695 --> 00:39:02.861
you would not have swiped on me. [grunts]

808
00:39:02.945 --> 00:39:06.528
Well, if it wasn't for Tag's photos,
you wouldn't have swiped on me.


809
00:39:06.611 --> 00:39:08.903
[grunts] How am I doing so far?

810
00:39:08.986 --> 00:39:10.736
-You're actually doing great.
-Yeah?


811
00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:11.986
-Yeah.
-[gasps, screams]


812
00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:13.361
[up-beat pop playing]

813
00:39:13.445 --> 00:39:15.986
-[Natalie] Do you have a hamper?
-[Josh] It's over by the closet.


814
00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:17.028
[clears throat]

815
00:39:25.486 --> 00:39:27.945
Is this how you boil your victims?

816
00:39:28.028 --> 00:39:31.236
Careful! Careful! Careful!
That's a wax warmer for candle-making.


817
00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.820
It's very expensive.

818
00:39:32.903 --> 00:39:33.820
Okay.

819
00:39:34.486 --> 00:39:36.695
Grandma June makes candles?

820
00:39:36.778 --> 00:39:38.528
Yes, it's one of her hobbies.

821
00:39:40.153 --> 00:39:41.695
Josh Lin?

822
00:39:41.778 --> 00:39:43.403
All right, fine, they're mine.

823
00:39:43.486 --> 00:39:47.195
Guys can do things
besides hunt and pay for everything, okay?


824
00:39:47.278 --> 00:39:50.528
Plus, I see this more
as a business than a hobby.


825
00:39:51.111 --> 00:39:52.695
-All right.
-Wait, hey, hey, whoa, whoa!


826
00:39:52.778 --> 00:39:54.945
-Let's see what you got. [grunts]
-Come on!


827
00:39:55.028 --> 00:39:55.986
[straining] Okay.

828
00:39:58.570 --> 00:39:59.403
Oh.

829
00:39:59.486 --> 00:40:02.528
You see, candles
are solely marketed to women.


830
00:40:02.611 --> 00:40:05.070
They all smell like flowers and candy

831
00:40:05.153 --> 00:40:08.903
with names like "Sweet Caresses"
or "Shooting Star."


832
00:40:08.986 --> 00:40:11.403
No self-respecting man's gonna buy those,

833
00:40:11.486 --> 00:40:14.028
even if his apartment
smells like bong water.


834
00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:18.986
So, I created my own line
of masculine candles


835
00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.320
that captures the essence of a dude.

836
00:40:21.403 --> 00:40:24.486
Yeah, I don't see "Compulsive Liar,"

837
00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:27.278
"Left The Toilet Seat Up,"
or "Won't Ask For Directions" in here.


838
00:40:27.361 --> 00:40:29.070
Make all the jokes you want,

839
00:40:29.153 --> 00:40:32.445
but 50 percent of the US candle market
is underserved.


840
00:40:32.528 --> 00:40:34.320
So, then why don't you serve them?

841
00:40:34.403 --> 00:40:36.111
Because a business costs money.

842
00:40:36.195 --> 00:40:39.320
Then ask your dad for a loan.
I feel like he's the target customer.


843
00:40:39.403 --> 00:40:40.695
-Have you met him?
-Yeah.


844
00:40:40.778 --> 00:40:42.903
-The old Asian man upstairs?
-Oh yeah.


845
00:40:42.986 --> 00:40:46.153
[Josh] He's only interested in sporty,
manly things.


846
00:40:46.236 --> 00:40:50.195
Plus, he and my brother
would just tease me about it.


847
00:40:50.945 --> 00:40:53.861
-[Natalie] You have a brother?
-[man] Prodigal son has returned!

I bought you. Huh? Yeah!

Oh, is she Grandma's new nurse?

-No.
-Ah! She must be in Mom's new book club.

-No, she is--
-[Owen] Oh shit. Shit. Uh…


870
00:41:51.736 --> 00:41:53.195
Is this another intervention?

No, honey.
Natalie is your brother's girlfriend.

windowless van by a playground.

Correct.

1254
00:59:39.861 --> 00:59:43.236
He used to climb up on the roof
every Christmas Eve and stomp around


1255
00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.361
so the boys knew Santa had arrived.

Okay. You just have to relax.

Relax? I can't relax. The tension
is the only thing holding me together.

[Eric] J
-Dog! Congrats, my man!

1656
01:20:32.903 --> 01:20:37.070
E-Rock! My mom really did invite
everybody in town. Huh?


1657
01:20:37.153 --> 01:20:41.195
Well, actually, I was just dropping off
your, uh, your lady's suitcase.


1658
01:20:41.278 --> 01:20:44.320
There's so much nice underwear in there.
You're a lucky guy.


1659
01:20:46.611 --> 01:20:48.736
I gotta say I'm surprised. 
[clears throat]

1660
01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:49.861
Lee?

1661
01:20:49.945 --> 01:20:53.695
-I didn't think it was gonna work out.
-How… how… are you here?


1662
01:20:53.778 --> 01:20:56.278
Duh, first class, honey.
I'm not a peasant.


1663
01:20:56.361 --> 01:20:57.570
No, I… I mean, um--

1664
01:20:57.653 --> 01:21:00.486
Listen, you're not the only one
that can stalk people on the internet.


1665
01:21:00.570 --> 01:21:05.070
I found out about this little soirée
courtesy of Barb's Facebook page. Hello!


1666
01:21:05.153 --> 01:21:07.570
[breathing heavily]

1667
01:21:09.028 --> 01:21:10.653
Hey, how's it going?

1668
01:21:11.403 --> 01:21:13.278
So, Tag and Lee are here.

1669
01:21:13.361 --> 01:21:16.528
-Lee? Are you dating two guys now?
-No, he's my boss.


1670
01:21:16.611 --> 01:21:18.320
What? Why is he here?

1671
01:21:18.403 --> 01:21:19.653
Because God hates me.

1672
01:21:21.653 --> 01:21:23.153
Glenlivet 12, neat.

1673
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:25.736
That's a man who knows how to drink.

1674
01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:29.861
Just act natural. We'll figure a way out.
We just got to stick together. Okay?


1675
01:21:29.945 --> 01:21:32.820
Hey, babe.
I want to introduce you to my parents.


1676
01:21:32.903 --> 01:21:33.903
I'm out.

1677
01:21:33.986 --> 01:21:35.528
What brings you here?

1678
01:21:35.611 --> 01:21:36.945
I'm Natalie's boss.

1679
01:21:38.445 --> 01:21:39.736
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.


1680
01:21:40.361 --> 01:21:41.236
Tell me more.

1681
01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:43.486
Mom, Dad, this is Natalie.

1682
01:21:43.570 --> 01:21:44.486
-Hello.
-Hi.


1683
01:21:44.570 --> 01:21:46.278
-Hi.
-Tag's told us so much about you.


1684
01:21:46.361 --> 01:21:48.736
He never says anything
about his girlfriends, so…


1685
01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:49.903
Dad, come on.

1686
01:21:49.986 --> 01:21:53.028
Girlfriend. Wow.
It's… it's so, so nice to meet you.


1687
01:21:53.111 --> 01:21:56.236
[breathlessly] I think I'm just gonna
go use the ladies' room.


1688
01:21:57.528 --> 01:21:59.361
Hey, not so fast. 
We need to talk.

1689
01:21:59.445 --> 01:22:02.403
-I'm kind of busy, Owen.
-Oh, talking to your lover, Tag?


1690
01:22:02.486 --> 01:22:06.486
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw you two
here last night looking pretty damn cozy.


1691
01:22:06.570 --> 01:22:08.945
Okay, it's not… it's not what you think.

1692
01:22:09.028 --> 01:22:11.778
Ah, that's funny,
because I didn't know what to think


1693
01:22:11.861 --> 01:22:14.153
until I spoke to your boss
a few seconds ago,


1694
01:22:14.236 --> 01:22:15.986
and now it all makes sense.

1695
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:17.528
Okay, look, I… I can explain.

1696
01:22:17.611 --> 01:22:19.111
-So the thing is--
-La-la-la-la…


1697
01:22:19.195 --> 01:22:23.236
I don't want to hear it. I just want you
to stop this charade with my brother.


1698
01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:27.403
Two glasses of Veuve, please.

1699
01:22:27.486 --> 01:22:29.986
-Tag, [burps] what's going on, bro?
-What's up, E?


1700
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:32.361
Can you believe
that J-Dog is getting married?


1701
01:22:32.445 --> 01:22:34.736
-Chick's pretty cool too.
-I haven't met her yet.


1702
01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:36.028
Well, she's right there.

1703
01:22:36.528 --> 01:22:37.903
Dude, that's his cousin.

1704
01:22:37.986 --> 01:22:41.611
I don't judge. 
You love who you love.

1705
01:22:41.695 --> 01:22:42.570
No. You know wh--

1706
01:22:42.653 --> 01:22:44.611
Why should I believe
what comes out of your mouth?


1707
01:22:44.695 --> 01:22:46.986
-Are you serious--
-Hey! Everything okay here?


1708
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:48.111
-No!
-Yes.


1709
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:53.153
Natalie, she didn't come to New York
for love. She came here for a story.


1710
01:22:53.236 --> 01:22:55.153
She's been playing you since day one, bro.

1711
01:22:55.236 --> 01:22:58.736
She's a writer for a Disaster Date column,
and you're not her fiancé.


1712
01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:00.236
You are her subject.

1713
01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:02.445
-Don't--
-Wait. What? Nat.


1714
01:23:02.528 --> 01:23:03.695
What is he talking about?

1715
01:23:05.903 --> 01:23:07.736
[Bob] Could I have everyone's attention?

1716
01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:09.070
[sighs]

1717
01:23:09.861 --> 01:23:12.528
I'm not one for speeches,
so I'll keep this quick.


1718
01:23:13.153 --> 01:23:13.986
Uh…

1719
01:23:14.486 --> 01:23:15.528
Josh.

1720
01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:19.736
I know we haven't always seen
eye-to-eye on things,


1721
01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:22.403
but you're a good
kid with a big heart,

1722
01:23:22.486 --> 01:23:27.778
and after spending, uh, the last week
with your beautiful bride-to-be,


1723
01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:32.028
I think the whole family agrees
that you've picked a winner!


1724
01:23:32.111 --> 01:23:34.153
I couldn't be happier for you, son.

1725
01:23:34.236 --> 01:23:38.028
So let's all raise a glass
to future Mr. and Mrs. Lin,


1726
01:23:38.111 --> 01:23:39.903
-Josh and--
-No!


1727
01:23:43.611 --> 01:23:45.070
Not yet. Um…

1728
01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:46.278
Uh…

1729
01:23:46.903 --> 01:23:50.320
[Natalie] We can't cheers
before all the speeches are done.


1730
01:23:50.403 --> 01:23:56.028
I mean, I'd like to add
to your beautiful, beautiful speech


1731
01:23:56.111 --> 01:23:59.236
with my own speech.

1732
01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:01.320
A speech sequel, per se,

1733
01:24:02.903 --> 01:24:06.236
about, um, love, and, uh, Josh,

1734
01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:07.236
and…

1735

-[crowd murmuring]


1737
01:24:15.195 --> 01:24:16.445
…dishonesty.

1738
01:24:18.028 --> 01:24:19.528
Because that's what I've been,

1739
01:24:20.486 --> 01:24:21.403
dishonest

1740
01:24:22.528 --> 01:24:25.111
with Josh, and the Lins,

1741
01:24:25.778 --> 01:24:26.945

[Natalie sighs]

1744
01:24:31.736 --> 01:24:32.945
[whispers] Here it goes.

1745
01:24:33.445 --> 01:24:35.986
[inhales] Four weeks ago,
I met a guy online.


1746
01:24:36.903 --> 01:24:40.986
He was smart, funny, sweet,
and he looked like him.


1747
01:24:42.486 --> 01:24:45.528
So, I decided to come here
and surprise him for Christmas.


1748
01:24:46.945 --> 01:24:49.028
But when I got here,
I realized that the guy


1749
01:24:49.111 --> 01:24:51.778
I was really talking to was him.

1750
01:24:53.486 --> 01:24:54.611
I got catfished,

1751
01:24:55.361 --> 01:24:56.528
and I was furious.

1752
01:24:57.945 --> 01:25:01.278
But Josh told me
that he would help get me Tag


1753
01:25:01.361 --> 01:25:04.236
if I pretended to be his girlfriend
for the holidays.


1754
01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.528
And I honestly just--

1755
01:25:05.611 --> 01:25:08.695
I… I thought
that my perfect match was here,


1756
01:25:08.778 --> 01:25:11.986
so I agreed, and I pretended
to be someone that I'm not, but…


1757
01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:15.153
[exhales] I just wanted my happy ending.

1758
01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:17.820
[scoffs]

1759
01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:21.153
[Natalie] But I can't do it anymore.
I… I… I can't lie.


1760
01:25:21.236 --> 01:25:22.986
I just can't, I'm sorry. I…

1761
01:25:25.236 --> 01:25:26.653
I'm so sorry.

01:25:36.778 --> 01:25:37.820
I hate him.

1766
01:25:40.111 --> 01:25:42.486
I literally had to get stoned
to get through it.


1767
01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:45.403
[chuckles] Yeah. 
Now, that's my girl.

1768
01:25:46.403 --> 01:25:51.153
[Tag] Okay, so… so you got mad at Josh
for catfishing you,


1769
01:25:51.236 --> 01:25:53.695
and then you go
and do the exact same thing to me.
