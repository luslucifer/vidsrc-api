1
00:00:11.472 --> 00:00:15.276
- And so Bathor created
man in his own image.


2
00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:17.845
In the image of
Bathor he created him.


3
00:00:17.845 --> 00:00:20.681
Male and female he created them.

4
00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:22.850
And to the female,
Bathor declared,


5
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.254
I will surely multiply
your pain in childbearing.


6
00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:28.756
In pain shall you
bring forth children.


7
00:00:28.756 --> 00:00:31.259
Your desire shall
be for your husband


8
00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.861
and he shall rule over you.

9
00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:36.197
Now, Bathor declared it so.

10
00:00:36.197 --> 00:00:39.100
But he women of our village
believe they know their place


11
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.669
even better than the Lord does

12
00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:43.804
for they bear us no children.

13
00:00:43.804 --> 00:00:45.739
They bear us no deference.

14
00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.576
And they do not drink
the blood of Bathor.


15
00:00:50.078 --> 00:00:53.581
They, these children of the
night feast on the blood of man.


16
00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:58.452
But charm is deceitful
and beauty is vain,


17
00:00:58.452 --> 00:01:02.556
but a woman who fears the
lord is to be praised.


18
00:01:02.556 --> 00:01:04.892
We witness no fear, and yet,

19
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.130
these daughters of
Bathor not only reject


20
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.500
the lord's teachings, but
use their flesh to turn us


21
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.168
to the side of evil.

22
00:01:15.303 --> 00:01:17.871
But the Lord preserves
all who love him,


23
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:20.508
but all the wicked
will be destroyed.


24
00:01:20.508 --> 00:01:23.544
Bathor gave us the
key to eternal life


25
00:01:23.544 --> 00:01:26.447
and eternal peace in paradise.

26
00:01:26.447 --> 00:01:31.319
And now we have betrayed Bathor,
and we are to be punished.


27
00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.522
They are the ones who
flaunt their barren flesh,


28
00:01:34.522 --> 00:01:37.958
and yet, we are to be punished.

29
00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.793
We are to be punished.

30
00:01:40.995 --> 00:01:44.532
God will forgive all
who confess their sin.


31
00:01:44.532 --> 00:01:48.202
We must cleanse Bathor's
home of this evil.


32
00:01:48.202 --> 00:01:50.904
We must purge this darkness.

33
00:01:50.904 --> 00:01:53.741
We must slay these demons.

34
00:01:53.741 --> 00:01:57.045
In the name of Bathor, our lord,

35
00:01:57.045 --> 00:02:00.014
we must spill the
blood of the triblades.


36
00:05:10.371 --> 00:05:13.173
- You must not get involved.

37
00:05:13.173 --> 00:05:14.842
This is not our war.

38
00:05:16.176 --> 00:05:18.746
We've waited over
a thousand years


39
00:05:18.746 --> 00:05:21.148
and we must remain patient.

40
00:05:21.148 --> 00:05:23.217
- A war is upon us, Naga.

41
00:05:24.585 --> 00:05:27.721
- Your day of vindication
will come, Giltine.


42
00:05:27.721 --> 00:05:29.723
But this is not our war.

43
00:07:11.158 --> 00:07:13.894
- Although
they've shown us none,


44
00:07:13.894 --> 00:07:16.830
I want to bring
justice for us all.


45
00:07:34.815 --> 00:07:37.418
- The triblades have
left us no choice.


46
00:07:37.418 --> 00:07:39.887
They have cursed
us with disease.


47
00:07:39.887 --> 00:07:42.790
But all of your suffering
will not last much longer.


48
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.392
We have accomplished
many great deeds


49
00:07:44.392 --> 00:07:47.227
in the name of Lord
Bathor to repay our sins,


50
00:07:47.227 --> 00:07:50.964
for when Alnwick was tempted
by the barren Bathsheba,


51
00:07:50.964 --> 00:07:54.034
and forced to give
in to his desires,


52
00:07:55.403 --> 00:07:57.671
some of us of faith might
say that Lord Bathor


53
00:07:57.671 --> 00:08:00.173
had turned his back on us.

54
00:08:00.173 --> 00:08:02.342
But we forgive you, Alnwick.

55
00:08:02.342 --> 00:08:04.478
- Thank you, Grando.

56
00:08:04.478 --> 00:08:08.649
- For Bathor has shown great
mercy, and so shall we.


57
00:08:10.784 --> 00:08:14.922
We shall bring an end
to your suffering.


58
00:08:17.691 --> 00:08:20.694
You shall no longer wear
the cloth of Bathor.


59
00:08:20.694 --> 00:08:23.296
You have given yourself to sin.

60
00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:38.579
For your eyes have
been used for evil,


61
00:08:39.847 --> 00:08:42.616
we shall return
them to goodness.


62
00:08:56.764 --> 00:09:00.868
Blood to blood, we return to
blood of Bathor to the Lord.


63
00:09:04.271 --> 00:09:07.140
Remove this empty
vessel from my sight.


64
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.044
Sanctify yourselves with
the blood of our lord.


65
00:09:12.379 --> 00:09:14.381
- The blood is the life.

66
00:09:15.583 --> 00:09:17.718
- I shall not be honored
with the blood of Bathor


67
00:09:17.718 --> 00:09:20.120
until I have rid his
land of the poison.


68
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.491
The land that 2,000 years
ago, he presented to us,


69
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:27.027
in exchange for caring for its
treasures until his return.


70
00:09:27.027 --> 00:09:30.263
Now we have failed
Bathor and must suffer


71
00:09:30.263 --> 00:09:34.001
until every hope, every
path, and every creature


72
00:09:34.001 --> 00:09:37.437
is free of the evil
that has overtaken us.


73
00:09:37.437 --> 00:09:40.608
The lustful sinners
must be destroyed.


74
00:09:41.775 --> 00:09:43.977
- Blood is life.

75
00:14:14.882 --> 00:14:17.517
- Why are we here, I'm bored.

76
00:14:17.517 --> 00:14:21.554
They invoke the Red,
it must be serious.


77
00:14:21.554 --> 00:14:25.025
- Let's go play, it's a
beautiful day for a swim.


78
00:14:25.025 --> 00:14:26.526
- It'll have to wait.

79
00:14:44.945 --> 00:14:47.948
- Yes, it's not very becoming.

80
00:14:47.948 --> 00:14:50.050
Not very becoming at all.

81
00:14:50.918 --> 00:14:52.986
And on my feeding nights.

82
00:14:54.788 --> 00:14:56.523
I hope to get this
over with quickly.


83
00:14:56.523 --> 00:14:58.491
- Me too, I don't wanna be here.

84
00:14:58.491 --> 00:15:00.627
- I'm simply starving.

85
00:15:00.627 --> 00:15:01.995
- We should just go.

86
00:15:01.995 --> 00:15:03.463
The exit is right around here.

87
00:15:03.463 --> 00:15:04.397
- Let's go.

88
00:15:04.397 --> 00:15:06.333
- I haven't done anything.

89
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.601
It's probably something

90
00:15:08.601 --> 00:15:10.203
completely mundane.

91
00:15:15.909 --> 00:15:20.080
- They must feel so dreadful
with their hair so bright.


92
00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.619
- Daughters of Bathor, it
is with great reluctance


93
00:15:26.619 --> 00:15:28.055
that we invoke the
Rite of the Red


94
00:15:28.055 --> 00:15:30.057
and call you here today.

95
00:15:31.158 --> 00:15:33.060
Until now, there
have been only rumors


96
00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.462
of an uprising upon us.

97
00:15:35.462 --> 00:15:39.066
But the murder of several
of our sisters has shown us


98
00:15:39.066 --> 00:15:41.668
that the judgement day is here.

99
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.772
- We nephites have convened

100
00:15:45.772 --> 00:15:49.076
and consulted our memories
of the word of Bathor.


101
00:15:49.076 --> 00:15:51.144
And determined that
the mercy of Bathor


102
00:15:51.144 --> 00:15:55.849
shall be granted only to
those of us who hold our faith


103
00:15:55.849 --> 00:15:58.518
and do not flee our duties here.

104
00:15:59.752 --> 00:16:03.556
The deaths of our
sisters purifies us all,


105
00:16:03.556 --> 00:16:06.894
for Bathor is just and merciful.

106
00:16:06.894 --> 00:16:10.530
- And the light of the
candle shine no more on me.


107
00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:14.935
And in her was found the blood
of prophets and of saints,


108
00:16:14.935 --> 00:16:19.339
and of all that were found
slain upon the Earth.


109
00:16:19.339 --> 00:16:21.108
- And after these things,

110
00:16:21.108 --> 00:16:24.311
I heard a great voice
of much people in heaven


111
00:16:24.311 --> 00:16:28.315
saying, hallelujah,
salvation, glory, and honor,


112
00:16:30.117 --> 00:16:32.485
for he has judged
the great whore


113
00:16:32.485 --> 00:16:35.688
which did corrupt the
earth with her fornication.


114
00:16:35.688 --> 00:16:39.893
- My sister was a kind
and honorable person.


115
00:16:39.893 --> 00:16:42.429
Her only sin was to
deny those beasts


116
00:16:42.429 --> 00:16:43.931
the pleasures of the flesh.

117
00:16:43.931 --> 00:16:48.101
- Speak not what you do
not understand, my child.


118
00:16:48.101 --> 00:16:51.004
Bathor has protected
us for 2,000 years


119
00:16:51.004 --> 00:16:54.541
and shall return to protect
us for an eternity more.


120
00:16:54.541 --> 00:16:57.310
We shall not fail
in this final trial,


121
00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:01.281
we shall not be cast
out at the final moment.


122
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:04.985
- This is a test to
see who is worthy


123
00:17:04.985 --> 00:17:08.655
of living in Bathor's
kingdom of peace and joy.


124
00:17:12.725 --> 00:17:17.097
- We shall not tolerate
rumors of unrest and flight.


125
00:17:17.097 --> 00:17:19.599
We shall all remain.

126
00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.201
The blood is the life.

127
00:17:21.201 --> 00:17:23.103
- The blood is the life.

128
00:17:23.103 --> 00:17:25.738
- This is the path of fools!

129
00:17:25.738 --> 00:17:28.908
We should flee, or
we should fight.


130
00:17:28.908 --> 00:17:32.845
But we should not sit
idly by and be destroyed.


131
00:17:32.845 --> 00:17:35.682
- Our
word is decided.


132
00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.352
The blood is the life.

133
00:17:39.352 --> 00:17:40.988
Now go.

134
00:17:52.365 --> 00:17:53.700
- What do we do?

135
00:18:24.264 --> 00:18:26.333
- Bless us, oh, Bathor,

136
00:18:26.333 --> 00:18:29.902
for these, thy gifts which
we are about to receive


137
00:18:29.902 --> 00:18:31.238
from thy bounty.

138
00:18:32.172 --> 00:18:34.007
The blood is the life.

139
00:18:51.091 --> 00:18:52.359
- Do you
remember a time


140
00:18:52.359 --> 00:18:55.262
when these people
walked the lands?


141
00:18:57.697 --> 00:19:00.733
- I can no longer
say what I remember.


142
00:19:00.733 --> 00:19:03.636
Just that the memory
was once mine.


143
00:19:05.738 --> 00:19:09.909
I see my mother laughing as
she sings a lost song to me.


144
00:19:13.546 --> 00:19:17.450
- And what of these
others, these other graves.


145
00:19:18.618 --> 00:19:21.654
- They are the homes
of the forgotten.


146
00:19:22.922 --> 00:19:25.425
Their names were written once.

147
00:19:26.826 --> 00:19:30.630
I see words dancing on
paper surrounded by flame.


148
00:19:35.202 --> 00:19:38.638
They were glorious
and wonderful,


149
00:19:38.638 --> 00:19:41.408
but their age of
dancing is gone.


150
00:19:42.575 --> 00:19:45.612
The ink has returned
to the night sky.


151
00:19:46.779 --> 00:19:49.316
And so, we must
pass the words on


152
00:19:51.218 --> 00:19:54.454
so that no more are forgotten.

153
00:19:54.454 --> 00:19:57.224
I know images of
pain, suffering,


154
00:19:58.658 --> 00:20:02.595
but I do not know what is
real and what is imaginary.


155
00:20:13.106 --> 00:20:14.941
We've lost everything.

156
00:20:16.609 --> 00:20:20.780
Eras far off as the stars,
flickering and echoing.


157
00:20:22.982 --> 00:20:25.752
They are no longer ours.

158
00:20:25.752 --> 00:20:28.020
Our words are gone forever.

159
00:20:31.057 --> 00:20:35.462
The fog of forgetfulness
creeps from the east


160
00:20:35.462 --> 00:20:39.566
every time we do not honor
the words of the past.


161
00:22:54.634 --> 00:22:57.870
- Aluka, I know you're
hungry, my love.


162
00:23:02.008 --> 00:23:06.379
I have held you for as
long as I can remember


163
00:23:06.379 --> 00:23:08.948
and I'll hold you forever more.

164
00:23:11.784 --> 00:23:13.753
- How can she continue
to expose herself


165
00:23:13.753 --> 00:23:15.922
to that innocent child?

166
00:23:15.922 --> 00:23:18.157
- She's vile and
dishonors Bathor.


167
00:23:18.157 --> 00:23:19.826
Only of Bathor's
blood shall we drink.


168
00:23:37.577 --> 00:23:40.246
- As I suspected, another woman.

169
00:26:04.891 --> 00:26:07.193
- You are in great danger.

170
00:26:07.193 --> 00:26:09.028
You must leave at once.

171
00:26:09.028 --> 00:26:11.263
You must all leave at once.

172
00:26:22.174 --> 00:26:24.343
- I have failed my people.

173
00:26:25.778 --> 00:26:29.949
We have spent these millennia
learning complacency.


174
00:26:31.718 --> 00:26:33.052
We cannot fight.

175
00:26:34.453 --> 00:26:37.890
We cannot survive
without the structures


176
00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:39.892
and routines of Bathory.

177
00:26:41.761 --> 00:26:45.832
We are caged and now we
are turning on ourselves.


178
00:26:49.101 --> 00:26:53.172
Just today, I ordered my
people to stay in place.


179
00:26:54.373 --> 00:26:57.176
I told them it was
the will of Bathor


180
00:26:57.176 --> 00:27:00.780
because I was afraid
of stealing their hope.


181
00:27:02.048 --> 00:27:03.883
We have nowhere to go.

182
00:27:05.852 --> 00:27:09.789
- I guess we should thank
you for driving us out


183
00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:12.925
so long ago, but
we cannot thank you


184
00:27:12.925 --> 00:27:16.763
for the many years of
suffering and isolation.


185
00:27:18.364 --> 00:27:22.334
But those memories
are finally fading.


186
00:27:22.334 --> 00:27:25.171
And we are the
keepers of history.


187
00:27:28.274 --> 00:27:30.076
- Drove you out?

188
00:27:30.076 --> 00:27:33.946
- You don't
even remember, do you.


189
00:27:33.946 --> 00:27:35.915
- I'm afraid not.

190
00:27:35.915 --> 00:27:40.720
- The fog curses you and
strips you of your clarity.


191
00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.388
But no matter.

192
00:27:42.388 --> 00:27:44.056
Meet us tomorrow
night in the clearing


193
00:27:44.056 --> 00:27:45.524
to the west of the village.

194
00:27:45.524 --> 00:27:49.729
We will guide you to safety,
teach you the ways of survival,


195
00:27:49.729 --> 00:27:53.900
and record whatever's left of
your culture, accomplishments.


196
00:27:59.772 --> 00:28:02.374
- Thank you for showing us mercy

197
00:28:04.143 --> 00:28:06.545
where we have shown you none.

198
00:28:10.249 --> 00:28:14.053
I must find the
other red nephites.


199
00:28:14.053 --> 00:28:18.224
We will call for a gathering
to prepare for the exodus.


200
00:29:24.423 --> 00:29:28.060
- When will
they come for us?


201
00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.162
- I do not know,

202
00:29:30.162 --> 00:29:33.766
and perhaps I do not
wish to know, Fantine.


203
00:29:35.567 --> 00:29:39.739
We cannot hide, for whatever
time we may have left,


204
00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.175
we cannot spend it in fear.

205
00:29:45.477 --> 00:29:48.080
- But I am
afraid, Elisabeth.


206
00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.081
I am afraid.

207
00:29:51.217 --> 00:29:54.386
- Do
not fear, Fantine.


208
00:29:54.386 --> 00:29:58.657
We are nothing but what we
believe ourselves to be,


209
00:29:58.657 --> 00:30:01.694
for we've all died many deaths.

210
00:30:01.694 --> 00:30:03.495
Once for each of the times

211
00:30:03.495 --> 00:30:06.699
we've allowed our
spirit to be crushed.


212
00:30:06.699 --> 00:30:10.469
And once for each of
the times we have acted


213
00:30:10.469 --> 00:30:14.640
against that which we
believe to be right and just.


214
00:30:17.209 --> 00:30:20.546
- What will happen
to us when we are slain?


215
00:30:20.546 --> 00:30:23.783
- Some say
we shall be reborn.


216
00:30:23.783 --> 00:30:28.020
Imbued with our true
purpose by Lord Bathor.


217
00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.623
Others doubt whether
we are reborn


218
00:30:31.623 --> 00:30:34.660
or our eternal fate
is to be forgotten.


219
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:38.264
There's a truth that
hides among the stars.


220
00:30:41.633 --> 00:30:45.637
- Will you stay
with me until the end?


221
00:30:47.006 --> 00:30:50.576
- I will,
Fantine, until the final star


222
00:30:50.576 --> 00:30:52.578
returns to the darkness.

223
00:31:32.451 --> 00:31:35.054
- I cannot stand by any longer.

224
00:31:36.255 --> 00:31:38.457
Although they nothing
to preserve our ways,


225
00:31:38.457 --> 00:31:40.960
and though they
act like children,


226
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:45.164
we cannot simply allow
them to be slaughtered.


227
00:31:47.599 --> 00:31:52.004
- There were thousands once,
according to the teachings.


228
00:31:52.004 --> 00:31:54.941
Now only a couple
dozen of us left.


229
00:32:24.803 --> 00:32:26.906
We must not get involved.

230
00:33:22.394 --> 00:33:24.063
- Vengeance is ours.

231
00:33:37.076 --> 00:33:41.247
- I have betrayed you all,
and I have betrayed Bathor.


232
00:33:46.318 --> 00:33:49.488
We must abandon our
homes and leave at once.


233
00:33:49.488 --> 00:33:52.291
- You have been taken by evil!

234
00:33:52.291 --> 00:33:53.859
- We knew there was
a traitor among us,


235
00:33:53.859 --> 00:33:56.695
but we never would
have suspected.


236
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:06.472
- For Bathor, the
blood is the life!


237
00:35:27.853 --> 00:35:30.089
I want those
outsiders destroyed!


238
00:35:30.089 --> 00:35:32.224
They mocked Bathor
for the last time.


239
00:35:32.224 --> 00:35:33.925
Bathor showed them
mercy by banishing them


240
00:35:33.925 --> 00:35:35.161
instead of executing them,

241
00:35:35.161 --> 00:35:37.829
and this is how
they repay Bathor?


242
00:36:47.099 --> 00:36:49.401
- We have won a great victory.

243
00:36:49.401 --> 00:36:52.371
Bathor has rewarded us
with this great honor.


244
00:36:53.605 --> 00:36:54.540
And at the same, has
given us another test


245
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.375
of our faith and our will.

246
00:36:56.375 --> 00:36:58.777
These wild demons were banished.

247
00:36:58.777 --> 00:37:00.846
We believe they had
been banished forever


248
00:37:00.846 --> 00:37:04.283
but now they have returned,
and now they too shall die,


249
00:37:04.283 --> 00:37:07.052
and Bathor shall grant us
this victory once more.


250
00:37:07.052 --> 00:37:08.354
A victory not only
of the present,


251
00:37:08.354 --> 00:37:10.222
but a victory of the future.

252
00:37:10.222 --> 00:37:11.790
We will cleanse
the land of Bathor


253
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:14.426
and prepare for his
impending return.


254
00:37:14.426 --> 00:37:17.763
The second era of
Bathor is almost here.


255
00:37:21.767 --> 00:37:23.669
Do you doubt the power,
the birthright of Bathor?


256
00:37:23.669 --> 00:37:26.205
- Bathor is almighty.

257
00:37:26.205 --> 00:37:27.038
- Good.

258
00:37:28.574 --> 00:37:30.342
Do any of your doubt the power,

259
00:37:30.342 --> 00:37:32.978
the honor, the
birthright of Bathor?


260
00:37:32.978 --> 00:37:34.513
- The
blood is the life.


261
00:37:34.513 --> 00:37:36.215
- Blood is the life.

262
00:37:36.215 --> 00:37:38.016
- I see there is
one whose conviction


263
00:37:38.016 --> 00:37:40.986
to the right of Bathor
is not strong enough.


264
00:37:40.986 --> 00:37:43.689
We cannot allow your
lack of enthusiasm


265
00:37:43.689 --> 00:37:46.525
and commitment to the
word of Bathor to fester.


266
00:37:46.525 --> 00:37:47.926
You are like a disease.

267
00:37:47.926 --> 00:37:49.595
Better see if we can find a cure

268
00:37:49.595 --> 00:37:51.863
before it is too
late for all of us.


269
00:37:51.863 --> 00:37:53.365
Remove your shoes.

270
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.834
- I'm sorry.

271
00:37:55.834 --> 00:37:57.102
I will fight to uphold
the word of Ba--


272
00:37:57.102 --> 00:37:59.037
- How dare you speak
the name of Bathor!


273
00:37:59.037 --> 00:38:01.773
You must make a blood sacrifice
to show you are worthy.


274
00:38:01.773 --> 00:38:03.275
Remove your shoes!

275
00:38:09.981 --> 00:38:11.917
Now you must complete
a test of will


276
00:38:11.917 --> 00:38:14.720
to show that Bathor
has given you honor.


277
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.989
You must walk the path of glass.

278
00:39:45.544 --> 00:39:46.978
Bathor has spoken.

279
00:39:46.978 --> 00:39:49.848
You transgression
has almost been paid.


280
00:39:49.848 --> 00:39:51.883
And you've drawn no blood.

281
00:39:51.883 --> 00:39:53.585
Now, with your last step,

282
00:39:53.585 --> 00:39:56.288
you must make an
offering to Bathor.


283
00:39:56.288 --> 00:39:58.089
The blood is the life.

284
00:39:58.089 --> 00:39:59.891
- Blood is the life.

285
00:40:01.893 --> 00:40:03.495
- Bathor
has called on us


286
00:40:03.495 --> 00:40:06.097
to take up our most
difficult quest.


287
00:40:06.097 --> 00:40:08.600
We must leave the village
and travel to the west,


288
00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.869
the land that
Bathor once forbade,


289
00:40:10.869 --> 00:40:13.271
to stop the spread
of this pestilence.


290
00:40:13.271 --> 00:40:16.141
Today, we each drink
twice the blood of Bathor


291
00:40:16.141 --> 00:40:18.410
to give us the power in
this ultimate battle.


292
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:21.480
Jacob, Stoker, you
two shall go forth


293
00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.815
as scouts to locate our enemy.

294
00:40:23.815 --> 00:40:25.917
- The
blood is the life.


295
00:40:25.917 --> 00:40:30.389
- Sava, Berwick, dispose
of this howling animal.


296
00:40:30.389 --> 00:40:31.490
- The blood is the life.

297
00:40:46.638 --> 00:40:48.073
- I shall take the
path to the east.


298
00:40:48.073 --> 00:40:50.476
- And I the path to the west.

299
00:40:51.777 --> 00:40:53.412
- The blood is the life.

300
00:40:53.412 --> 00:40:55.414
- The blood is the life.

301
00:40:56.715 --> 00:40:58.484
The blood is the life

302
00:41:27.579 --> 00:41:29.415
- You've had your day.

303
00:41:30.749 --> 00:41:34.019
The second coming of
Bathor is upon us.


304
00:41:34.019 --> 00:41:38.323
I hope you're prepared for
what you've set in motion.


305
00:41:38.323 --> 00:41:42.494
You're covered in the blood of
corruption, go wash yourself.


306
00:41:55.941 --> 00:41:58.176
- What is this place?

307
00:41:58.176 --> 00:42:01.513
- What do all you wild women
need with all these things?


308
00:42:01.513 --> 00:42:04.082
Have you stolen them?

309
00:42:04.082 --> 00:42:06.818
- There is nothing
wild about us.


310
00:42:08.186 --> 00:42:11.289
We have advanced while
you've remained stationary.


311
00:42:11.289 --> 00:42:14.460
We are the last
preservers of culture.


312
00:42:15.627 --> 00:42:18.597
After you banished us,
we knew that our destiny


313
00:42:18.597 --> 00:42:21.032
was to keep our legacy.

314
00:42:21.032 --> 00:42:25.771
And, you, on the other hand,
lived in complacent waste.


315
00:42:25.771 --> 00:42:27.305
You've accomplished
nothing at all


316
00:42:27.305 --> 00:42:30.909
as we grasp at sands
to keep your memories.


317
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:34.513
- Elisabeth, are you all right?

318
00:42:36.414 --> 00:42:38.316
- That book is
in her mother tongue,


319
00:42:38.316 --> 00:42:40.552
lost for a thousand years.

320
00:44:24.723 --> 00:44:26.057
- Giltine, you need to do.

321
00:45:46.337 --> 00:45:49.240
Where there is one,
there are many.


322
00:46:39.457 --> 00:46:41.960
We must take him to the twins.

323
00:48:32.938 --> 00:48:33.872
- Do not.

324
00:48:33.872 --> 00:48:34.806
- Be alarmed.

325
00:48:34.806 --> 00:48:35.740
- You are with.

326
00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:36.407
- Friends.

327
00:48:36.407 --> 00:48:37.675
- Your blood.

328
00:48:37.675 --> 00:48:39.177
- Was full of poison.

329
00:48:39.177 --> 00:48:40.511
- The blood of Bathor.

330
00:48:40.511 --> 00:48:41.880
- Must be running out.

331
00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:42.713
- Your blood.

332
00:48:42.713 --> 00:48:43.548
- Is thin.

333
00:48:43.548 --> 00:48:44.482
- And impure.

334
00:48:44.482 --> 00:48:45.683
- We have cleaned your blood.

335
00:48:45.683 --> 00:48:47.118
- As we do our own.

336
00:48:47.118 --> 00:48:48.353
What is?

337
00:48:48.353 --> 00:48:50.555
What is your name?

338
00:48:50.555 --> 00:48:52.891
- I am Jacob, son of Bathor.

339
00:48:52.891 --> 00:48:53.859
- Jacob, you.

340
00:48:53.859 --> 00:48:54.926
- Are healed.

341
00:48:54.926 --> 00:48:55.760
- You must.

342
00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:56.594
- Drink.

343
00:48:56.594 --> 00:48:57.428
- More fresh.

344
00:48:57.428 --> 00:48:58.897
- Blood.

345
00:48:58.897 --> 00:49:02.834
- Jacob, we apologize for
this, but you must sleep now.


346
00:49:02.834 --> 00:49:05.370
- Count down with us from 10.

347
00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:06.804
- 10.

348
00:49:06.804 --> 00:49:08.206
Nine.

349
00:49:08.206 --> 00:49:09.440
Eight.

350
00:49:16.181 --> 00:49:18.416
- We shall spill their blood.

351
00:49:18.416 --> 00:49:20.818
We will return their
flesh to Bathor.


352
00:49:20.818 --> 00:49:22.353
Then, and only then--

353
00:49:22.353 --> 00:49:23.521
- I've found them.

354
00:49:23.521 --> 00:49:24.755
I've found them!

355
00:49:24.755 --> 00:49:26.024
- You have interrupted
the word of Bathor,


356
00:49:26.024 --> 00:49:27.658
I hope you bring great news.

357
00:49:27.658 --> 00:49:29.060
- Indeed I do.

358
00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:30.761
- Excellent, prepare
your weapons.


359
00:49:30.761 --> 00:49:32.163
Jacob, lead us to victory.

360
00:49:32.163 --> 00:49:37.035
- No, Grando, you do not
understand, they have healed me.


361
00:49:37.035 --> 00:49:38.436
I have no wounds.

362
00:49:39.437 --> 00:49:40.872
- It is true.

363
00:49:40.872 --> 00:49:42.740
- What trickery is this.

364
00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:45.576
- We must stop drinking
the blood of Bathor!


365
00:49:45.576 --> 00:49:46.677
- Blasphemer!

366
00:49:46.677 --> 00:49:47.712
Liar!

367
00:49:47.712 --> 00:49:48.914
See what they have done?

368
00:49:48.914 --> 00:49:51.249
They mean to destroy
us from within!


369
00:49:51.249 --> 00:49:54.185
They have taken the
name of Bathor in vain,


370
00:49:54.185 --> 00:49:56.521
and for this, they will pay.

371
00:49:57.688 --> 00:50:00.325
We must rid this
man of his demons.


372
00:50:20.545 --> 00:50:23.248
Behold, Bathor has
given us the power


373
00:50:23.248 --> 00:50:25.984
to tread upon serpents,
and over scorpions,


374
00:50:25.984 --> 00:50:29.820
and overall, the
power of the enemy.


375
00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:32.924
You must confess
your sins to Bathor.


376
00:51:28.246 --> 00:51:31.216
Fetch Jacob's brother,
the unloyal Esau.


377
00:51:31.216 --> 00:51:33.284
Bathor's light shines upon him.

378
00:51:33.284 --> 00:51:36.554
He's been given an
opportunity to redeem himself.


379
00:51:36.554 --> 00:51:37.388
- The blood is the life.

380
00:51:37.388 --> 00:51:39.390
- The blood is the life.

381
00:52:18.663 --> 00:52:21.799
Grando has found
some use for you.


382
00:52:21.799 --> 00:52:26.137
- You have one last chance
in the eyes of Bathor.


383
00:52:26.137 --> 00:52:27.972
- You'll do perfectly.

384
00:52:29.074 --> 00:52:30.975
Just right for Grando
and for Bathor.


385
00:53:37.942 --> 00:53:39.110
- He is alive.

386
00:53:43.581 --> 00:53:45.483
- Get him to the twins.

387
00:54:21.319 --> 00:54:22.787
- Will he be all right?

388
00:54:22.787 --> 00:54:26.257
- The twins say
he should be fine.


389
00:54:26.257 --> 00:54:30.428
- Until he returns to his
cult and they kill him anyway.


390
00:54:30.428 --> 00:54:33.097
I don't know why we even bother.

391
00:54:35.065 --> 00:54:38.903
- I see them off in
the distance to the east.


392
00:54:38.903 --> 00:54:42.072
- Giltine and I will cut
them off before the clearing.


393
00:54:42.072 --> 00:54:43.874
- I won't leave without her.

394
00:54:43.874 --> 00:54:45.843
She knows the true
language of Bathor.


395
00:54:45.843 --> 00:54:46.677
- Fine.

396
00:55:16.807 --> 00:55:17.742
- Do not.

397
00:55:17.742 --> 00:55:18.676
- Be alarmed.

398
00:55:18.676 --> 00:55:19.610
- You are with.

399
00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:20.545
- Friends.

400
00:55:20.545 --> 00:55:21.746
- Your blood.

401
00:55:21.746 --> 00:55:22.980
Was full of poison.

402
00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:24.249
The blood of Bathor.

403
00:55:24.249 --> 00:55:25.316
Must be running out.

404
00:55:42.667 --> 00:55:45.035
- So you are the traitor!

405
00:55:45.035 --> 00:55:46.203
How could you.

406
00:55:48.773 --> 00:55:50.174
- Time for a nap.

407
00:56:03.988 --> 00:56:06.324
- Good morning, Fantine.

408
00:56:06.324 --> 00:56:09.093
I don't mind if it takes
you all day to confess.


409
00:56:09.093 --> 00:56:10.428
I'm in no hurry.

410
00:56:21.171 --> 00:56:23.408
We have demonized
the men for too long.


411
00:56:23.408 --> 00:56:25.410
We have made them suffer,

412
00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:29.246
though it is us who tempt
them with our shame.


413
00:56:34.652 --> 00:56:37.522
We must no longer
deny our bodies.


414
00:56:37.522 --> 00:56:39.390
We must be vessels for Bathor,

415
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:42.293
granting new children
for the Lord.


416
00:56:48.333 --> 00:56:50.401
Now, Fantine, you must tell me.

417
00:56:50.401 --> 00:56:54.138
How can you lift this
curse we placed on the men?


418
00:56:54.138 --> 00:56:55.506
You must call upon the others

419
00:56:55.506 --> 00:56:58.175
to return to the word of Bathor.

420
00:57:01.011 --> 00:57:02.980
- We do not remember,

421
00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:06.116
or even recall the
true word of Bathor.


422
00:57:06.116 --> 00:57:08.719
We cannot read the edicts.

423
00:57:08.719 --> 00:57:10.721
We only remember
what we choose to.


424
00:57:10.721 --> 00:57:11.556
- Lie!

425
00:57:12.923 --> 00:57:16.694
You were just as foul
as Grando said you were.


426
00:57:16.694 --> 00:57:18.829
Well, I shall break your will!

427
00:57:23.401 --> 00:57:25.603
- We must divert our eyes.

428
00:57:25.603 --> 00:57:28.939
The seductress will try to
sway us from the word of Bathor


429
00:57:28.939 --> 00:57:30.908
with her supple body.

430
00:57:30.908 --> 00:57:34.278
Look away and close
your eyes tightly.


431
00:59:19.283 --> 00:59:20.685
- Run, Elisabeth!

432
00:59:52.717 --> 00:59:55.385
- I am hungry, and I am
frightened, Elisabeth.


433
01:10:07.331 --> 01:10:09.065
- Look at
this abomination.


434
01:10:09.065 --> 01:10:10.934
Such evil from
the bowels of hell


435
01:10:10.934 --> 01:10:13.770
should not set
foot here on Earth.


436
01:11:27.744 --> 01:11:31.080
- And in the same way
also, the women abandoned


437
01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.283
the natural function of the man.

438
01:11:33.283 --> 01:11:35.952
And burned in their
desire toward one another.


439
01:11:35.952 --> 01:11:39.456
Women with women committing
indecent acts, and receiving


440
01:11:39.456 --> 01:11:43.560
in their own persons, due
penalty of their error.


441
01:12:23.633 --> 01:12:24.968
- Bathor,
we have served you


442
01:12:24.968 --> 01:12:26.303
with all of our hearts.

443
01:12:26.303 --> 01:12:28.372
We have done all you have asked.

444
01:12:28.372 --> 01:12:31.308
We have vanquished all
who might destroy you.


445
01:12:31.308 --> 01:12:33.610
We protect you in
our hearts and minds,


446
01:12:33.610 --> 01:12:36.012
and we pray for the
day when you may return


447
01:12:36.012 --> 01:12:40.183
from your holy conquests to
bring peace upon the land.


448
01:12:47.991 --> 01:12:51.328
You, you've blessed
us with your return.


449
01:12:54.531 --> 01:12:57.767
You are not Lord
Bathor, you cannot be.


450
01:12:58.668 --> 01:13:00.670
But, it can't be, the triblades,

451
01:13:00.670 --> 01:13:01.738
they have all been destroyed.

452
01:13:01.738 --> 01:13:03.973
- I left you with paradise.

453
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:10.113
I gave you the gift
of eternal life.


454
01:13:11.415 --> 01:13:15.018
I gave you the
gift of perfection,


455
01:13:15.018 --> 01:13:17.854
and this is how
you honor my name.


456
01:13:20.089 --> 01:13:22.158
What have you done
to my children?


457
01:13:22.158 --> 01:13:23.760
- But all of
your children remain.


458
01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.496
Those who have betrayed you
have been returned to the blood.


459
01:13:26.496 --> 01:13:28.332
- Returned in my name?

460
01:13:29.766 --> 01:13:34.170
What gives you the right to
destroy that which I created?


461
01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:36.272
- Obeying your
words of 2,000 years--


462
01:13:36.272 --> 01:13:38.308
- I left no words!

463
01:13:38.308 --> 01:13:41.578
I left no place for
your destruction.


464
01:13:41.578 --> 01:13:44.348
I left peace and harmony

465
01:13:44.348 --> 01:13:47.417
and journeyed off
to build our empire.


466
01:13:47.417 --> 01:13:48.952
And I have.

467
01:13:48.952 --> 01:13:50.487
- You are
great, Lord Bathor--


468
01:13:50.487 --> 01:13:51.921
- Enough, enough.

469
01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:56.726
You have committed
sins in my name.


470
01:13:59.028 --> 01:14:02.065
I sought for a world
where we could be free,


471
01:14:02.065 --> 01:14:04.901
and you turned to
hate in my name.
