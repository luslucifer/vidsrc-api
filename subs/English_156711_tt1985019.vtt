00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.116
What separates the casual Jane
Austen fan from the aficionado?


3
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.996
Is it her admiration for the style
and manners of the Regency era?


4
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.038
The number of times
she has read Austen's novels?


5
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.877
Or her consuming love
for Mr. Darcy?

Hey, Horseface.

25
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.676
Jimmy, what are you doing here?

26
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.479
Well, I heard you
broke up with Greg.


27
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.072
So that means you're free
to go bowling tonight.

Oops!
Jimmy! You know what?

I don't wanna see you again.

31
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.355
I picked you on purpose, Jane Hayes.
Thirty plus, clock ticking.


32
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.598
I'm as good as it gets, baby.

of Austen does so much more</i>

admire her world from afar.</i>

Excuse me.

36
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.597
She finds her way here

37
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.875
to the world's only immersive
Austen experience.


38

MOLLY:
Is that a Chihuahua?


39
00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.874
It's a lamb. Shut up.
Just trying to hear it.


40
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.116
This looks really cheap.

41
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.192
AGENT: I've toured the grounds
and it's not cheap.


42
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.678
This is high class.
This is big time.


43
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.396
Jane, are you really
gonna blow your entire


44
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.036
life savings on
an "Austen experience"?


45
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.960
Now, hold on just a second,

46
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.196
here at Sensuous Travel,

47
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.438
we are not just another
run-of-the-mill vacation place.


48
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.077
This is what we call
an "LC." A Life-Changer.


49
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.434
You get to play the heroine of
your very own Jane Austen story.


50
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.315
Would you like to
see some of the staff?


51
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.154
Yeah.
No.


52
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.196
Now this is Barnaby.
He's a vegan.


53
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.272
He enjoys nightly
dips in the pond,


54
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.392
and he has a pony
named Sparkles Pancake.


55
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.960
That is horrendous.

56
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.636
I also heard that people in those
days didn't wear underwear.


57
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.757
That's a lie.

58
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.831
It's not a lie.

59
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.440
Look, every stay at Austenland
ends with a real live ball,


60
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.918
as in ballroom,
as in happily ever after.


61
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.357
Do you understand
what I'm saying?


62
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.511
Totally.

63
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.192
Jane. So you go on some fancy vacation,
then what do you come home to?


64
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.438
Nothing except for
an empty bank account.


65
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.271
Why don't you save up
for a real life-changer?


66
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.233
Like what?
Well, like...


67
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.916
That's fine. Maybe come back
another time without your friend.


68
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.111
We'll get you squared away.

69
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.352
I think I can figure out some
kind of layaway program for you.


70
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.715
Thank you so much.

71
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.113
You guys take care. Thanks for being you.
Appreciate you.


72
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.872
Listen, this is my one chance to
really live in Austen's world. Okay?


73
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.475
I'm her biggest fan.

74
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.717
Come on.

75
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:34.917
No. No.

76
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.794
You used to be a fan.

77
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.680
You are an addict.

78
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.277
You don't have to go in there because
I'm packing. It's a mess in there.


79
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.721
You don't wanna go in there.

80
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.397
Oh, Janey.
It's gotten so much worse.


81
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.911
(SQUEAKING)
I love you.


82
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.714
It's a collector's item
and that's why I have it.


83
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.916
<i>I have 10,000 a year.</i>

84
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.241
I've changed my mind.

85
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.155
I totally support you
going to this place,


86
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.591
because I'm sure
that the fantasy


87
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.957
will not be as
fulfilling as you imagine.


88
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.521
I don't think you
know where I'm going.


89
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.560
We could make a wager on it.
Fine.


90
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.880
If I win,
you de-Austen your room.


91
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.272
Okay.
Fine.


92
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.595
And if you really must go, I
made you a little farewell gift.


93
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.280
You did?

94
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.601
Aw.

95
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.031
Wow.

96
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.521
Which historical era
is this supposed to be from?


97
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.877
Hey, I spent three
days working on it.


98
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.799
Come here, let's hug it out.

99
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.475
Thank you.
Okay.


100
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.118
When you get back, just clear
this crap out because it's weird.

to take us up to the manor.

Ma'am.

Good luck.
Thanks.


160

Complete immersion
in the Regency era


161
00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:27.159
is the only way to truly
appreciate Austen's England.


162
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.510
Wouldn't you say so,
Miss Charming?

(IN BRITISH ACCENT)
Righto!


164
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.119
Just to avoid any confusion,

165
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:37.354
I'd like you to know that we do
offer several distinct experiences.


166
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.874
You have paid for
the Basic Copper package,


167
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.910
while the other
ladies in the party


168
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.510
are part of
the Platinum Elite package.


169
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.280
Oh. Okay.

170
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.671
I'm sure you'll understand there will
be some exclusions to your trip.


171
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.237
I mean, I'm just so
excited to be here,


172
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.472
and I've dreamed
about this for so long.


173
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.518
All of my guests
will experience


174
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.718
romance with one of our actors.

175
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.873
But I must emphasize
there is to be no touching


176
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:08.077
other than the necessary social graces.
Not a chance.


177

I also expect
all my guests to maintain


178
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.193
appropriate manners
and conversation


179
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.677
and to eschew
all things modern.


180

Any flagrant
disobedience will result


181

in the early
termination of your stay.

You don't have
to worry about me.

I know Austen's
books intimately.

is a match-making custom.

in love, shall we say?

AMELIA: We most definitely
should say.


315

At your age,

316
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:53.751
I'm sorry.

How unfortunate.

Excuse me.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:15.192
You know, I know how it feels to
be treated badly by stupid men.


323
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.755
I really do.

324
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.759
Jane, come on.
Give me a hug.


325
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.921
Come on. At least it's not
gonna happen at this place.


326
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.511
Besides, you'll feel
totally different tomorrow.


327
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.035
Think about all the people in
the world that hang themselves.


328
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.756
And then the next day,
they feel different,


329
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.441
but there's nothing
they can do about it.


330
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:37.917
Don't hang yourself, Jane.
Mmm-hmm.


331
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:42.361
Anyway, if you need anything,
just call me. I'm right down the hall.


332
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.952
Well, actually,
I'm not right down the hall


333
00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:50.516
because you're in the servants' wing.
You're in the creepy tower.


334
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.157
God, sometimes I think
about you here at night.


335
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.159
Must be really scary.

336
00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.714
It's okay.
Anyway.


337
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.156
And, Jane,
the maid told me that...


338
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.797
FYI, she said don't
use the chamber pots.


339
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:11.878
Apparently the toilets
really do flush here,


340
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.310
and they don't know what to do
if it's just piled high.


341
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.236
Right.

342
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.112
Of course,
he made all his money


343
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.232
selling quicklime
on the continent.


344
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:33.110
You can never have enough whitewash,
as my grandfather used to say.


345
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:36.641
Then he contracted
dysentery and died.

dangerous down here. Okay?


632

Anything could happen.

633
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:05.076

up in that house all afternoon.

Everyone. I have great news.

679
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:34.360
Captain George East has just
arrived from the West Indies.


680
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:42.996
Good morning, ladies.

681
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:45.680
You're beautiful.

I hear you were
just made captain.

Do tell us the story.

Yes, we like stories. Please do.
Can't wait.


685
00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:58.597
I were raised on the sea. Ferrying
goods between the islands.


686
00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:03.196
But when Napoleon struck, I joined
arms with me British brothers.


687
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:06.233
Bravi, bravi.

688
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:10.357
Within months
I were first mate,


689
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:12.876
and then came my
moment of destiny.


690
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:16.400
Imagine one lone
British frigate,


691
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:18.632
surrounded by four
French war crafts,


692
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:19.836
cap'n dead on the deck.

693
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.639
"Surrender," came the cry.
Anyone buying this?


694
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:23.959
"Never," said I.

695
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:25.841
Did you die?

696
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:31.994
Now I were tempted to surrender,
but I had to hearten me men.


697
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:34.760
"Death first."

698
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:41.680
But surely there could be
no dishonor in surrender


699
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:45.192
with your captain dead
and your men so outnumbered?


700
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:48.353
When my seaman's heart
tell me what to do,


701
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:51.036
I do not fear to
follow through.


702

That rhymes. That rhymes.

703
00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:54.790
But right now,

704
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:59.521
my seaman's heart
bid me do thusly.


705
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:05.238

sensual creature.

00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:27.798
I asked for it.

938
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:29.634
I am single
because, apparently,


939
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:31.792
the only good
men are fictional.


940
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:32.917
Touché.

941
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:36.312
And you think that there's
any good women out there?


942
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:37.960
No, no, no.

943
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:40.476
They profess
honesty and fidelity,


944
00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:42.871
and while you're away
lecturing in Switzerland,


945
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:45.271
they run off to
Brazil with your mate!


946
00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:48.194
MISS CHARMING: Get on with
the game, you old windbag!


947
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:51.194
Someone departing?

948
00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:01.280
That's my trunk.

949
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:05.878
I have discovered an unmentionable
amongst your things.


950
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:07.839
Now I believe I
made it perfectly clear


951
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:09.674
about the rules,
Miss Erstwhile.


952
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:11.639
We thank you for your stay,
but I regret that


953
00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:13.758
your actions have
forced me to cut it short.


954
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:15.237
What?

955
00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:16.914
First, that horrid
little song and now this.


956
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:18.355
You're really
gonna kick me out?


957
00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:21.161
I'm afraid it is
time for you to leave.


958
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:27.801
Go get 'em, Charming.

959
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:29.761
I'm so sorry, Jane.

960
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:35.311
If you would be so kind
as to step on to the cart.


961
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:40.081
Mrs. Wattlesbrook.

962
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:41.640
Please, wait.

963
00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:46.994
This is all my fault.

964
00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:50.119
The modern contraption is mine.

965
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:53.234
I did not realize I had
it until I first arrived.


966
00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:55.751
And I was so distressed,

967
00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:59.437
Miss Erstwhile kindly offered
to keep it for me


968
00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:03.433
where I would not have to
look upon the eyesore...


969
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:05.239
MRS. WATTLESBROOK:
Oh. Well,


970
00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:06.550
I see.

971
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:09.634
So, apparently this appears
to be an accident,


972
00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:14.719
and I think the best thing is we
should pretend like it never happened.


973
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:21.950
Lady Heartwright,
I do so hope that you will


974
00:56:22.030 --> 00:56:24.431
continue to honor us
with your presence.


975
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:26.679
Yes. Of course.

976
00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:28.396
Thank you.

977
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:36.960
I forbid you to leave,
ever, Miss Erstwhile.


978
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:41.515
We were just getting
to know each other.


979
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:49.440
Miss Erstwhile.

980
00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:52.272
Yeah. Hi.

981
00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:55.354
Thank you for back there
with Mrs. Wattlesbrook.


982
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:57.034
It was a pleasure to save you.

983
00:56:57.110 --> 00:57:00.034
And, please,
you must call me Amelia.


984
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:02.476
Really?

985
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:04.521
Make haste.

986
00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:06.830
Quickly.

987
00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:15.195
Amelia?

988
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:21.111
Dear Jane, now that
we are bosom sisters,


989
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:23.676
I can at last
confide in someone.


990
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:27.676
Oh, Janey,

991
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:31.391
last year, at the ball,

992
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:33.230
Georgie...

993
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:37.161
George East and I

994
00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:40.153
became engaged.

995
00:57:42.030 --> 00:57:43.111
It is true.

996
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:47.680
But alas, he was a poor sailor,

997
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:52.237
and my father broke off the
engagement without my assent.


998
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:57.073
If I try to
explain this to him now,


999
00:57:58.110 --> 00:57:59.839
George will think
I only want him back


1000
00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:02.675
because he has
become a wealthy captain.


1001
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:06.517
What am I to do?

1002
00:58:06.590 --> 00:58:10.481
I sort of thought you were
into Nobley, or is that not...


1003
00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:12.320
No, no, no!

1004
00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:16.557
Dear Jane, I know
you will help me


1005
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:19.201
find a way to be
alone with Captain East.


1006
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:22.592
I don't really
know what I could do.


1007
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:26.197
It pained me to be so dishonest

1008
00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:28.272
with Mrs. Wattlesbrook
back there.


1009
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:31.558
But so long as you

1010
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:35.318
are my dearest friend,

1011
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:38.478
I'll keep your secret.

1012
00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:40.756
Oh.

1013
00:58:41.790 --> 00:58:44.839
Or should I say secrets?

1014
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:50.991
Farewell, bosom sister.

1015
00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:04.798
You know, I think being creative
is a waste of time and money.


1016
00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:08.474
AMELIA: Well, I love ribbons
and feathers and colors.


1017
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:11.921
Another blue tit,
please, Miss Charming.


1018
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:15.073
All right, but don't
copy everything I do.


1019
00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:16.390
I'll try.

1020
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:18.000
ANDREWS: We're not worthy,
Mrs. Wattlesbrook.


1021
00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:20.994
Their hearts will positively
burst from the rapture.


1022
00:59:22.350 --> 00:59:25.513
I have something of the
utmost urgency to report.


1023
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:28.035
Who's game for
a bit of amusement?


1024
00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:30.636
Me! Me! I'm so bored.

1025
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:33.395
Well, well, my cupcake,

1026
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:36.792
Mrs. Wattlesbrook has only
gone and surpassed herself


1027
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:40.511
and has completed
a brilliant theatrical.


1028
00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:42.913
You don't look like
you could read or write.


1029
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:44.151
It's just a trifle.

1030
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:46.916
Now, there are six parts.

1031
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:48.800
Three sets of lovers.

1032
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:52.636
And I thought, give us something
to pass the time until the ball,


1033
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:54.838
we could rehearse
it and perform it


1034
00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:58.631
for our illustrious
and distinguished authoress.


1035
00:59:58.710 --> 01:00:00.280
Now are there any questions?

1036
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:02.479
No.
No what?


1037
01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:04.678
You can't make me do a play.
It's humiliating.


1038
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:07.799
That's not a question. It's out
of the question, I'm afraid.


1039
01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:09.793
I've got a question.

1040
01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:11.759
Who gets to pick the lovers?

1041
01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:15.320
Well, I'm thinking
maybe ladies' choice.


1042
01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:16.915
You know, maybe alphabetically.

1043
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.634
Goody, goody.

1044
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:21.236
Eeny, meeny, miny... You!

1045
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:23.716
<i>Ma chérie.</i>

1046
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:25.954
And you, Miss Erstwhile?

1047
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:27.680
MISS CHARMING:
Pick wisely, Jane.


1048
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:39.912
I guess Mr. Nobley.

1049
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:49.394
Sorry. Sorry.
That's okay.


1050
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:50.631
Sorry.

1051
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:55.320
Okay, since we have to spend so
much time rehearsing this thing,


1052
01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:58.519
let's just... Let's try
not to annoy each other.


1053
01:00:58.590 --> 01:01:00.319
You don't annoy me.

1054
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:05.153
You make me nervous.

1055
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:19.191
So, are you enjoying your stay?

1056
01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:24.273
Really?
We're making small talk now?


1057
01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:28.951
Okay.

1058
01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:36.794
Well, the house is amazing, but
it's kind of like a corset.


1059
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:38.838
I like the way it looks,
but it's just...


1060
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:40.918
Hard to relax in it.

1061
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:42.475
Yes, exactly.

1062
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:46.037
But there is so
much to love here.


1063
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:48.676
I mean, the civility.

1064
01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:49.911
The manners.

1065
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:51.958
The grandeur, you know.

1066
01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:53.555
Simplicity.

1067
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:57.675
The men.

1068
01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:00.835
The women.

1069
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:04.881
The paintings.
They're really...


1070
01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:06.597
Yes, you are an artist.

1071
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:07.757
No, no, no.

1072
01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:11.039
The thing is, those aren't real.
They're just stupid sketches.


1073
01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:12.999
Who's that?
Exactly.


1074
01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:14.913
I'm sorry.
They're not all like that.


1075
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:16.196
No, no. It's a...

1076
01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:18.990
It's a fair likeness.
No apologies needed.


1077
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:25.474
It is curious, however,

1078
01:02:25.550 --> 01:02:28.679
that there are more
of me than anyone else.


1079
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:34.034
I guess I've been trying to
figure you out without much luck.


1080
01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:36.799
Surely you've come
to some conclusions.


1081
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:39.638
You're the resident
Mr. Darcy.


1082
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:42.316
Come on,
you're every girl's fantasy.


1083
01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:46.034
So I'm your fantasy?

1084
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:50.390
You play your
character very well.


1085
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:55.031
Right.

1086
01:02:57.550 --> 01:02:58.631
Shall we rehearse, then?

1087
01:02:58.750 --> 01:02:59.797
Yes.

1088
01:02:59.870 --> 01:03:01.076
Roger.

1089
01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:11.640
Are they acting?

1090
01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:18.320
I don't know what's real
or what's not anymore.


1091
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:19.915
I mean, what if
she actually is...


1092
01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:21.475
In love with him?

1093
01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:24.912
Well, don't you think it's possible
to confuse truth with fantasy?


1094

1253
01:13:48.230 --> 01:13:49.800
Miss Erstwhile?

1254
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:51.995
Shall we?

1255
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:55.511
(MOUTHING)

1256
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:14.354
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

1257
01:14:20.230 --> 01:14:22.278
Shall we?
Yes.


1258
01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:29.831
You're stunning.

1259
01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:30.951
Really?

1260
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:51.440
You all right?

1261
01:14:51.710 --> 01:14:54.600
I'm fine. And you?
Are you having fun?


1262
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:57.921
I'm taking an inordinate amount
of pleasure from this evening.


1263
01:14:58.550 --> 01:15:01.554
MISS CHARMING: You're so light on your
feet, you look like a nutcracker.


1264
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:05.512
But none of it from the ball.

1265
01:15:06.190 --> 01:15:08.397
I think you just
complimented me.


1266
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:10.472
Jane, I need to
tell you something.


1267
01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:12.479
I'm not meant to say
or do these things,


1268
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:14.957
my aunt would kill me, but...

1269
01:15:15.190 --> 01:15:16.715
You are my sun and my moon.

1270
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:19.316
My earth and my stars.

1271
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:20.716
Marry me.

1272
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:24.317
Marry you? Oh, my God,
of course I will.


1273
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:27.671
Oh, God, I love you.
I love you.


1274
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:30.720
You make me the happiest
man alive, dear Amelia,


1275
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:33.316
if you'd be my wife.

1276
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:35.159
Oh, George.

1277
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:42.081
Jane.
Remember our first night?


1278
01:15:43.230 --> 01:15:46.200
Something about bad first
impressions comes to mind.


1279
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:48.757
I know your opinion
of me was horrible.


1280
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:51.197
I was horrible.

1281
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:52.635
I was nervous.

1282
01:15:52.710 --> 01:15:54.121
I felt out of place
and I certainly


1283
01:15:54.190 --> 01:15:56.397
didn't intend on
falling in love, but...


1284
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:57.871
I have.

1285
01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:00.916
I can't imagine leaving
this place without you.


1286
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:05.001
Please,
tell me if I have any hope.


1287
01:16:07.670 --> 01:16:09.911
I didn't realize...

1288
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:12.561
This is how I'd
feel at this part.


1289
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:15.352
Feel what?

1290
01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:23.190
You were right, this is a
dangerous kind of game.


1291
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:27.751
I don't wanna play anymore.

1292
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:30.994
What do you want?

1293
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:33.714
I want something real.

1294
01:16:37.710 --> 01:16:38.836
Excuse me.

1295
01:16:39.710 --> 01:16:41.360
Excuse me.

1296
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:43.915
Hey.

1297
01:16:44.190 --> 01:16:45.316
Do you still
wanna get out of here?


1298
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:46.471
Yeah.

1299
01:16:47.150 --> 01:16:48.390
Sorry.

1300
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:49.596
Good night, Your Majesty.

1301
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:54.273
I didn't think I was touching
you inappropriately.


1302
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:55.840
Well, you did.
And if we're to be together,


1303
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:58.356
you must never ever do
anything like that ever again,


1304
01:16:58.430 --> 01:17:00.159
if we're to be together.

1305
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:03.715
Even Prudence is getting some.

1306
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:07.320
(LAUGHING)

1307
01:17:11.230 --> 01:17:13.153
Are you ready?
Yes.


1308
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:23.516
So Wattlesbrook got Nobley
to propose to me tonight.


1309
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:24.751
Yeah. Classic.

1310
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:25.956
Yup.

1311
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:28.192
Is that when you
walked out? Just...


1312
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:30.677
Man, what a tart.

1313
01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:31.990
Ah.

1314
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:36.835
I have to admit his character
was pretty dreamy.


1315
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:38.921
Yeah.

1316
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:41.275
I wouldn't marry him.

1317
01:17:43.230 --> 01:17:45.631
Mainly because
he's got bad knees.


1318
01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:48.077
Bad knees?
Did he mention his knees?


1319
01:17:48.670 --> 01:17:50.559
I'm an even bigger nerd
than I thought, though.


1320
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:53.474
I mean, there were
actual moments


1321
01:17:53.550 --> 01:17:55.871
when I really did
believe it was real.


1322
01:17:55.950 --> 01:17:59.591
Don't feel bad. I mean, Wattlesbrook
hires the best actors around.


1323
01:17:59.710 --> 01:18:01.200
Yeah.

1324
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:03.271
And...

1325
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:08.352
Some of her clients, you know,
aren't half bad either.


1326
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:13.321
(SIGHS)

1327
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:16.196
I'm so glad you're
outside of the fantasy.


1328
01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:18.796
Makes it easier to
walk away from it all.


1329
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:22.714
You know my
flight leaves tomorrow,


1330
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:25.270
but I could see if
I could change it.


1331
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:27.478
Stay a few extra
days in London.


1332
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:34.160
That's an offer I...
I'm not gonna refuse.


1333
01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:38.477
I fancy seeing you in...

1334
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:41.556
I don't know,
some trousers or...


1335
01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:45.597
Do you wear anything
less 1800s, ever?


1336
01:18:45.670 --> 01:18:46.910
Do you?

1337
01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:49.675
Yeah, I do the short shorts.
(LAUGHS)


1338

<i>MRS. WATTLESBROOK: Please bring
soiled petticoats and undergarments...</i>


1339

Lizzie.


1340
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:56.559
Are you off?

1341
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:58.678
I'm off.
I'm packing up.


1342
01:18:59.510 --> 01:19:01.911
Hey, you know,
I wanted to say just...


1343
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:03.630
Thanks for everything.

1344
01:19:03.710 --> 01:19:05.838
And I made this for you.

1345
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:08.554
All the sewing we did.

1346
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:10.632
That's beautiful.

1347
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:14.433
I think she's way prettier
than me, don't you think?


1348
01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:16.161
(LAUGHS)

1349
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:19.271
That's really
great needlepoint.


1350
01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:22.110
So what are you gonna do now?

1351
01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:24.670
I thought I would stay on

1352
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:26.115
and check out all
the new recruits.


1353
01:19:26.190 --> 01:19:27.601
You know, make sure that

1354
01:19:27.670 --> 01:19:31.152
all of them know that
Colonel Andrews is taken.


1355
01:19:31.230 --> 01:19:35.633
And then I thought I would
ask Miss Wattlesbrook


1356
01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:38.190
if I can buy the place.

1357
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:39.476
You should.

1358
01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:41.473
I know. I think I should.

1359
01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:44.281
Lizzie, you know, I think...

1360
01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:46.557
I think that Colonel Andrews...

1361
01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:50.954
I think he...
That he might be...


1362
01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:57.839
Perfect for you.

1363
01:19:58.470 --> 01:20:00.154
Jane, thank you.

1364
01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:03.393
I was so afraid you were gonna
say you thought he was gay.


1365
01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:06.161
AMELIA: Adieu.

1366
01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:08.675
Farewell.

1367
01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:10.994
(LAUGHING)

1368
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:15.155
God, that was
the best time so far.


1369
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:17.159
Except for the eye gouging.

1370
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:18.681
You're not British?

1371
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:20.081
Yeah, I know, right?

1372
01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:23.797
Well, that's what two years of
private drama tutoring will get you.


1373
01:20:24.590 --> 01:20:26.274
You ended up
with Nobley, right?


1374
01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:28.637
He was such a bore,
but, you know...


1375
01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:30.832
He did a good job
of being into you.


1376
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:33.351
He asked me to pretend
your cell phone was mine.


1377
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:37.795
It's so sad when
the trip is over, but,


1378
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:40.601
frankly, lam dying
for a massage.


1379
01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:45.041
My husband's old.

1380
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:47.716
Very old.

1381
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:53.952
And I trust you
discovered rewarding


1382
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:56.192
romance with one
of the gentlemen?


1383
01:20:58.150 --> 01:21:01.393
Actually, there was someone,

1384
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:04.633
but not Mr. Nobley,
as you may have intended.


1385
01:21:05.790 --> 01:21:07.918
My dear, Henry was
never meant for you.


1386
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:11.079
No, his job was to take care
of Lady Heartwright


1387
01:21:11.150 --> 01:21:13.630
until George East
finished his little show.


1388
01:21:14.190 --> 01:21:17.273
No, Martin was scripted for you
right from the very beginning.


1389
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:21.560
No, but he's...

1390
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:23.551
Martin's a servant.

1391
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:27.994
Well, you've seen my servants.

1392
01:21:28.670 --> 01:21:32.470
I had to take him out just for a
little while because things were


1393
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:34.800
steaming up.

1394
01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:38.478
But I had every confidence
that he could woo you back.


1395
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:40.598
And your timing
was very fortunate.


1396
01:21:40.670 --> 01:21:43.116
Most of the ladies just
get a litter of kittens.


1397
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:46.200
The foal is the showstopper.

1398
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:48.400
The foal?

1399
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:51.360
I trust you would like
to be on your way, Jane?


1400
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:53.310
More than ever.

1401
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:54.670
Are you upset?

1402
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:56.835
No, not at all.

1403
01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:59.959
And please don't take it
personally when I shut you down.


1404
01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:01.111
Shut me down?

1405
01:22:01.190 --> 01:22:04.160
I wasn't the first guest
Mr. Wattlesbrook assaulted, was I?


1406
01:22:04.230 --> 01:22:07.074
I should be able to find
other complaints in no time.


1407
01:22:07.150 --> 01:22:08.197

Wow, Nobley, eh?

1411
01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:28.319
Tied your cravat just a wee
bit too tight, didn't you?


1412
01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:31.712
To be honest, I can't believe
you didn't get Jane.


1413
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:34.236
I mean, she was...
She was anyone's.

Yes.

Yes, no. I'll tell

Yes. Yes, you have a good day.
Of course. Bye-bye.

Martin, that was the old girl
back at the house.

Hi, I think they...

1428
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:49.636
Jane. Hey.

1429
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:52.919
I'm really sorry
you didn't know, okay?


1430
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:56.161
I'd still like to spend
the night together. Yeah?


1431
01:23:58.150 --> 01:24:00.152
You are an actor!

1432
01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:02.400
Hey. Hey, but...

1433
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:05.155
But you're desperately
in love with me anyway?


1434
01:24:05.230 --> 01:24:08.279
And these sudden passionate feelings
that sent you running after me


1435
01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:11.194
have nothing to do with
Mrs. Wattlesbrook's fear


1436
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:12.760
that I'm gonna report
her delinquent husband?


1437
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:14.798
Of course not. Okay?
Right.


1438
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:16.395
I know it all seems shady,
but romances

have bloomed on stonier ground.

1440
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:23.392
Did Wattlesbrook write that line?
Because we know you didn't.


1441
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:25.674
Okay, she wrote the line. Okay?
Right.

But I'm the one
standing here saying it.

Jane!

Jolly good, the prefect's
here to save the day.


1445

You can't believe
anything he's said.


1446
01:24:34.190 --> 01:24:36.591
I've only just realized now that
Martin was assigned to you.


1447
01:24:36.670 --> 01:24:38.479
I know. I... Yeah.

1448
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:39.881
She knows, so...

1449
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:41.754
So, what are you doing here?

1450
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:44.198
It's just that
I don't think you understand


1451
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:46.318
that I'm not
what you think I am.


1452
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:48.358
I have fallen for you.
Right.


1453
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:50.314
My aunt was an actor, sure.

1454
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:53.872
She's an odd woman, I know,
but she was desperate.


1455
01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:55.475
What I'm saying is
that your first week


1456
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:57.080
at the manor was
my first week, too.


1457
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:58.840
I'm not an actor.

1458
01:24:58.910 --> 01:25:00.639
Don't listen to him, Janey.

1459
01:25:00.710 --> 01:25:03.793
Don't call me Janey!
You were paid to kiss me.


1460
01:25:03.870 --> 01:25:06.794
As far as you are concerned,
lam Miss Erstwhile.


1461
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:08.918
I mean, it's so embarrassing.

1462
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:10.833
What, do you keep
a supply of pregnant horses


1463
01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:12.719
just laying
around or something?


1464
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:14.838
What?
You're not a vet!


1465
01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:16.480
I did a biology
class at school.


1466
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:17.790
Come on, you were acting, too.

1467
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:19.440
Look, before you go
and make your report,


1468
01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:21.954
you should know, gorgeous,

1469
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:25.318
that what we had was real.

1470
01:25:25.710 --> 01:25:28.554
No, you didn't. What we
had was real. Didn't we?


1471
01:25:29.190 --> 01:25:34.321
Surely you felt it seeping through
all these costumes and pretense?


1472
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:36.119
He's still acting.
It's all part of his act.


1473
01:25:36.230 --> 01:25:37.994
See the costume?
He's an actor.


1474
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:39.720
You're just jealous,
aren't you?


1475
01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:41.315
Because my aunt
would rather bring in


1476
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:43.631
a complete novice
than move some

You know, I'm not
gonna report your aunt.

to send you all the way here.

Oh.

That's really nice.

1540
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:07.435
I used to think my aunt's
profession was somewhat grotesque,


1541
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:09.911
but the truth is that I enjoyed
stepping into history.

The idea of
a simpler world where

love is straightforward

I believe we have
that in common.

But all of this is
secondary to the fact


1546

that I am completely
mad about you.


1547
01:30:25.710 --> 01:30:27.155
All right.
Well you


1548

may have been mad
about Miss Erstwhile, but...


1549
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:32.318
You don't even know me. I...

1550
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:34.753
You are Miss Erstwhile.

1551

I saw you in the theatrical.
You were horrifying.


1552

Wait a minute. You were
horrifying. I was...


1553

Neither one of us are
capable of pretending.

don't think this is a...

you wanted something real.

believe that I am real.
