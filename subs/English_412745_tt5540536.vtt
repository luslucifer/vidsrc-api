00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.275
VOICEOVER:
And what is the dream?


2
00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:40.800
First, it is the burning idea
of liberty,


3
00:00:40.844 --> 00:00:43.629
of free men
governing themselves.


4
00:00:43.673 --> 00:00:45.457
And second,
it is the promise


5
00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:47.764
that in such a climate
of freedom,


6
00:00:47.807 --> 00:00:50.549
men can build
a more productive society,


7
00:00:50.593 --> 00:00:52.421
one which will bring
the greatest benefit


8
00:00:52.464 --> 00:00:54.074
to the greatest number.

9
00:00:55.685 --> 00:00:59.645
Such is the boldness of which
the American dream is made.


10
00:01:01.647 --> 00:01:03.214
- All of that's
out of the window now.


11
00:01:03.258 --> 00:01:06.478
- The deal that said,
"Work hard, get a lot of stuff"


12
00:01:06.522 --> 00:01:09.133
is now,
"Work hard, get into debt."


13
00:01:09.177 --> 00:01:12.571
- Young people today are facing
a completely different reality.


14
00:01:12.615 --> 00:01:14.094
- Change is inevitable now,

15
00:01:14.138 --> 00:01:15.487
and it's going to happen
at a much faster rate


16
00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:17.185
than we've ever
been used to before.


17
00:01:17.228 --> 00:01:20.144
- What values will replace
the American dream?


18
00:01:25.628 --> 00:01:26.933
MALE NARRATOR:
For generations,


19
00:01:26.977 --> 00:01:29.153
those living in
and coming to North America


20
00:01:29.197 --> 00:01:31.721
have been inspired by an ideal.

21
00:01:31.764 --> 00:01:33.723
In many ways,
this ideal is framed


22
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:36.726
in the famous line of
the United States Constitution,


23
00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:40.686
"Life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness."


24
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.298
In 1931, James Adams
in his book,


25
00:01:43.341 --> 00:01:44.864
The Epic of America,

26
00:01:44.908 --> 00:01:47.345
coined the term,
"the American dream,"


27
00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:49.913
to describe this promise
of a better, richer


28
00:01:49.956 --> 00:01:53.569
and happier life
for all citizens of every rank.


29
00:01:53.612 --> 00:01:56.528
Of course, in fact, there were
cruel societal barriers


30
00:01:56.572 --> 00:01:59.444
to education and advancement
for minorities,


31
00:01:59.488 --> 00:02:02.317
but in spite of these,
even though severely restricted,


32
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.057
many could still
rise with the tide


33
00:02:04.101 --> 00:02:06.408
of new possibilities
of security and stability


34
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:08.540
for their families.

35
00:02:08.584 --> 00:02:09.715
SETH GODIN:
Well, the American dream


36
00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.546
is based on possibility
and dignity.


37
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.070
The possibility part
is that you could come


38
00:02:17.114 --> 00:02:21.553
from someplace else
and if you just showed up,


39
00:02:21.597 --> 00:02:24.295
did what you were told,
did it with earnestness,


40
00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.732
did it with consistency,
you would get ahead


41
00:02:26.776 --> 00:02:29.126
and your kids would get
even further ahead.


42
00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:30.780
And what that promised

43
00:02:30.823 --> 00:02:33.217
in addition to being able to
take care of your family


44
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:35.872
was the dignity
that came from


45
00:02:35.915 --> 00:02:37.395
being respected
in your community


46
00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.136
because we decided
not to measure


47
00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:40.529
who your parents were,

48
00:02:40.572 --> 00:02:42.966
not to measure so much
what you looked like,


49
00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:45.142
but to measure
how much you got paid.


50
00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:48.798
And so there was this path
to get from where you were


51
00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:50.321
to where you wanted to be.

52
00:02:50.365 --> 00:02:52.497
That was the promise.

53
00:02:53.803 --> 00:02:58.286
But it's essential to understand
what the fuel was:


54
00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.506
75 years
of the Industrial Revolution


55
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.073
paying dividends.

56
00:03:06.511 --> 00:03:09.340
Organized production
in the United States


57
00:03:09.384 --> 00:03:11.124
was so profitable

58
00:03:11.168 --> 00:03:14.911
that we had a shortage of
workers who could do the work.


59
00:03:14.954 --> 00:03:17.653
So if you just got on the train,
you were going to make it


60
00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:20.308
because that engine
kept pushing you forward.


61
00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:28.838
NARRATOR: But after
the Second World War,


62
00:03:28.881 --> 00:03:32.145
the goal of the American dream
began to shift.


63
00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.279
In the U.S., returning veterans
received low interest mortgages


64
00:03:35.323 --> 00:03:37.455
with no down payment required.

65
00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:39.631
This made home ownership
the new norm.


66
00:03:39.675 --> 00:03:41.503
The car became
widely affordable,


67
00:03:41.546 --> 00:03:43.896
allowing a new living
arrangement called the suburb


68
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.464
to sprawl outward
away from city centers.


69
00:03:46.508 --> 00:03:48.597
The G.I. Bill
also provided tuition money


70
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.990
for veterans to attend college.

71
00:03:51.034 --> 00:03:52.949
This profoundly changed
expectations


72
00:03:52.992 --> 00:03:55.038
regarding university attendance.

73
00:03:55.081 --> 00:03:58.694
From 1940 to 1965,
the number of U.S. adults


74
00:03:58.737 --> 00:04:00.435
completing four years
of university


75
00:04:00.478 --> 00:04:02.306
had more than doubled.

76
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.831
Prosperity seemed guaranteed.

77
00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:08.443
- No one issued
a written statement that said,


78
00:04:08.486 --> 00:04:10.140
"This is a promise."

79
00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:12.447
It was just built
into the culture.


80
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.842
And one of the toxic elements
of it was the money part.


81
00:04:20.846 --> 00:04:23.458
People perceived
that this was a race


82
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:26.199
to amass the most stuff,

83
00:04:26.243 --> 00:04:28.985
until the engine
that fueled the whole thing


84
00:04:29.028 --> 00:04:31.553
started to run out of steam,

85
00:04:31.596 --> 00:04:33.381
because then the only way
to amass more stuff


86
00:04:33.424 --> 00:04:35.426
was to cheat,
was to cut corners,


87
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.951
was to moonlight and then
have your spouse moonlight,


88
00:04:38.995 --> 00:04:42.912
and then just pay attention
to nothing but the stuff.


89
00:04:42.955 --> 00:04:44.348
NARRATOR: By the time
the pursuit of wealth


90
00:04:44.392 --> 00:04:46.742
had replaced the simple hope
of a better life,


91
00:04:46.785 --> 00:04:50.006
the economic foundation
on which it had all been based


92
00:04:50.049 --> 00:04:52.791
had developed serious cracks.

93
00:04:52.835 --> 00:04:54.880
SETH GODIN: I think we can trace
it back to the container ship


94
00:04:54.924 --> 00:04:56.099
because the container ship

95
00:04:56.142 --> 00:04:58.928
completely revolutionizes
geography.


96
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.238
And that means that all of
the dynamics that were in place


97
00:05:05.282 --> 00:05:08.198
that made being local important
disappeared,


98
00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:10.766
and suddenly the whole world
is your competition.


99
00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:13.159
Add to that the internet
that shows up,


100
00:05:13.203 --> 00:05:16.598
it now makes it so that
all prices are transparent,


101
00:05:16.641 --> 00:05:19.078
that if you make average stuff
for average people,


102
00:05:19.122 --> 00:05:21.646
and you say to everyone,
"I'm the cheapest,"


103
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.996
you're in a race
to the bottom.


104
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.391
NARRATOR: In 2008, the greatest
recession since the 1930s


105
00:05:27.435 --> 00:05:29.001
touched the heart
of North America


106
00:05:29.045 --> 00:05:30.612
at a profound level,

107
00:05:30.655 --> 00:05:33.702
as millions lost their
family homes to foreclosure.


108
00:05:33.745 --> 00:05:35.399
Unemployment soared.

109
00:05:35.443 --> 00:05:38.707
For the millennial generation
just entering the workforce,


110
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.145
the American dream
was like a bad check.


111
00:05:42.188 --> 00:05:46.976
Currently, 20% of all children
in the U.S. live in poverty.


112
00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:49.892
America is one of the least
upwardly mobile nations


113
00:05:49.935 --> 00:05:51.502
in the developed world.

114
00:05:51.546 --> 00:05:53.939
Sixty percent
of college graduates


115
00:05:53.983 --> 00:05:57.595
work in jobs
that do not require a degree.


116
00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.772
The average household debt,
carried by American families,


117
00:06:00.816 --> 00:06:06.604
is estimated to be $204,992.

118
00:06:06.648 --> 00:06:09.477
Fifty-four percent
of respondents in a recent poll


119
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.958
said the American dream
is unattainable.


120
00:06:13.002 --> 00:06:14.699
- And over and over again,
the promise was,


121
00:06:14.743 --> 00:06:16.135
"It's okay,
you'll get a job,


122
00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:18.007
you can pay off your debt
in three years."


123
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.443
It was a lie.

124
00:06:19.487 --> 00:06:22.402
That is why
people are disillusioned,


125
00:06:22.446 --> 00:06:26.102
because they got sold,
literally sold something,


126
00:06:26.145 --> 00:06:28.321
that's fundamentally
no longer true.


127
00:06:36.155 --> 00:06:38.027
NARRATOR: While disillusionment
with the American dream


128
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.725
cuts across generations,
the millennials


129
00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:43.902
[those born from the early '80s
to the early 2000s]


130
00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:47.036
will have the most impact
on framing the new ideal.


131
00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:48.994
Will the choice of careers
be based around something


132
00:06:49.038 --> 00:06:51.693
other than maximum salary?

133
00:06:51.736 --> 00:06:54.783
What kind of companies
will draw motivated employees?


134
00:06:54.826 --> 00:06:57.220
What will education look like?

135
00:06:57.263 --> 00:06:59.701
What will guide
people's choice of home?


136
00:06:59.744 --> 00:07:02.181
What will form
the millennial dream?

138
00:07:13.541 --> 00:07:15.064
SETH GODIN:
We're seeing a shift


139
00:07:15.107 --> 00:07:16.892
in what people entering the
workforce


140
00:07:16.935 --> 00:07:19.721
are looking for
from their careers.


141
00:07:19.764 --> 00:07:21.810
It's a shift from,

142
00:07:21.853 --> 00:07:25.291
"Tell me what to do and promise
I can work here forever,"


143
00:07:25.335 --> 00:07:28.730
to "Listen to me,
I think I know what to do,


144
00:07:28.773 --> 00:07:32.037
and this is a project,
it's not my life."


145
00:07:32.081 --> 00:07:33.386
NARRATOR:
Why do I go to work?


146
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.910
Under the American dream,

147
00:07:34.953 --> 00:07:37.652
careers were seen as the path
to a better future.


148
00:07:37.695 --> 00:07:38.870
How is work changing

149
00:07:38.914 --> 00:07:41.438
and what is it we want
from our jobs?


150
00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:43.353
Deloitte conducted
a global survey


151
00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:46.138
of the emerging workforce
to get an accurate read.


152
00:07:47.618 --> 00:07:49.098
PAUL MACMILLAN: I think
what we find more recently


153
00:07:49.141 --> 00:07:51.361
with respect to
the millennial generation


154
00:07:51.404 --> 00:07:53.929
is there's definitely
a solid work ethic,


155
00:07:53.972 --> 00:07:56.148
a very strong work ethic,

156
00:07:56.192 --> 00:07:59.935
and a much more networked
kind of generation.


157
00:07:59.978 --> 00:08:01.632
There's, I think,
less of a feeling


158
00:08:01.676 --> 00:08:04.766
that you're into
a career employment type model.


159
00:08:04.809 --> 00:08:08.857
You would tend to look for
some sense of accomplishment,


160
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.688
more interested in job variety,
opportunity to advance a skill,


161
00:08:13.731 --> 00:08:15.646
potential to have
an impact in an area


162
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.649
that is important to you with
respect to your social view.


163
00:08:18.693 --> 00:08:19.955
I wouldn't want to suggest
that that doesn't mean


164
00:08:19.998 --> 00:08:23.132
people aren't interested
in getting ahead


165
00:08:23.175 --> 00:08:26.701
or progressing or improving
their living standard,


166
00:08:26.744 --> 00:08:29.965
but for sure,
this feeling of an ability


167
00:08:30.008 --> 00:08:33.098
or a desire to contribute
more broadly to society


168
00:08:33.142 --> 00:08:36.624
beyond the paycheck
is absolutely real.


169
00:08:36.667 --> 00:08:38.756
NARRATOR: For some,
like Jennifer Starr,


170
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.150
this desire for a job
with more fulfillment


171
00:08:41.193 --> 00:08:44.588
is so strong that they actually
leave high paying positions


172
00:08:44.632 --> 00:08:47.417
for the world of nonprofit.

173
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.158
Jen moved from corporate life
to become


174
00:08:49.201 --> 00:08:52.988
Director of Partnerships
for Free the Children.


175
00:08:53.031 --> 00:08:54.163
JENNIFER STARR:
I spent the last 11 years


176
00:08:54.206 --> 00:08:57.035
in the HR outsourcing services
industry,


177
00:08:57.079 --> 00:09:00.125
so doing everything from
account management in sales


178
00:09:00.169 --> 00:09:02.519
to project management,
operations.


179
00:09:02.562 --> 00:09:04.652
So decided that it was
time for me to take


180
00:09:04.695 --> 00:09:07.742
all of the years of experience
and the great opportunities


181
00:09:07.785 --> 00:09:09.352
that I've had
to develop my skills


182
00:09:09.395 --> 00:09:11.441
and take them into
the not-for-profit sector.


183
00:09:13.008 --> 00:09:15.924
I spend 50 or 60 hours a week
at least working,


184
00:09:15.967 --> 00:09:17.926
and I was doing that
previously as well,


185
00:09:17.969 --> 00:09:20.493
and so for me,
at this point in my life,


186
00:09:20.537 --> 00:09:23.714
I wanted to make sure
that that was fulfilling me.


187
00:09:23.758 --> 00:09:25.803
I knew that compensation
would be different


188
00:09:25.847 --> 00:09:27.152
coming from
a corporate environment,


189
00:09:27.196 --> 00:09:28.371
but there's so many
other benefits


190
00:09:28.414 --> 00:09:29.981
to working for
this organization.


191
00:09:30.025 --> 00:09:31.504
I get to travel
around the country


192
00:09:31.548 --> 00:09:32.723
when we have our We Day events

193
00:09:32.767 --> 00:09:34.899
and get to go to dinners
with talent


194
00:09:34.943 --> 00:09:37.249
and see incredible youth
and their speeches,


195
00:09:37.293 --> 00:09:40.513
and just be so connected
to what we're actually doing


196
00:09:40.557 --> 00:09:42.994
that those experiences
more than make up


197
00:09:43.038 --> 00:09:46.171
for any kind of monetary change
that I experienced.


198
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.873
The leap and the jump
is easier than people expect.


199
00:09:51.916 --> 00:09:54.179
It's worth taking the risk.

200
00:09:56.268 --> 00:09:58.531
NARRATOR: The growing desire
for more than just a paycheck,


201
00:09:58.575 --> 00:10:01.230
however, is not a choice
open to all.


202
00:10:01.273 --> 00:10:03.711
Many students who have
trained for a career path


203
00:10:03.754 --> 00:10:05.451
they thought
would bring fulfillment


204
00:10:05.495 --> 00:10:09.194
find upon graduation
that the game has changed.


205
00:10:09.238 --> 00:10:11.240
Ryan Porter
thinks about this a lot.


206
00:10:11.283 --> 00:10:13.155
He runs Raise Your Flag,

207
00:10:13.198 --> 00:10:15.505
a startup
that helps youth find work.


208
00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:17.376
He cautions
that there is a dark side


209
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.118
to the concept
of meaningful jobs.


210
00:10:21.337 --> 00:10:22.991
- The very first thing
that I find,


211
00:10:23.034 --> 00:10:24.906
and from our experience
with young people


212
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:26.211
that they're feeling

213
00:10:26.255 --> 00:10:28.344
is they feel like
they failed the system.


214
00:10:28.387 --> 00:10:29.562
And then
we also have these people


215
00:10:29.606 --> 00:10:30.955
that go through
university or college,


216
00:10:30.999 --> 00:10:32.696
come out the other end
without guaranteed work


217
00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.350
or without the prospect of work,

218
00:10:34.393 --> 00:10:35.830
and so what they start to do
is say,


219
00:10:35.873 --> 00:10:38.180
"Well, if I can be broke
doing this job,


220
00:10:38.223 --> 00:10:39.572
I might as well be broke

221
00:10:39.616 --> 00:10:41.749
doing a job that I love
or that has purpose."


222
00:10:41.792 --> 00:10:43.489
And the way that everybody else
interprets that is like,


223
00:10:43.533 --> 00:10:46.362
"Millennials care about jobs
with purpose."


224
00:10:46.405 --> 00:10:48.364
Maybe some of them do,

225
00:10:48.407 --> 00:10:51.193
but some of them need to pay
their cell phone bill lastmonth


226
00:10:51.236 --> 00:10:53.064
and they're just looking
for work to do that.


227
00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.938
NARRATOR: Helping young people
find that first job


228
00:10:56.981 --> 00:10:58.461
and start a career path

229
00:10:58.504 --> 00:10:59.941
has given Ryan
a clear picture


230
00:10:59.984 --> 00:11:02.944
of just how tough
the job market has become.


231
00:11:02.987 --> 00:11:05.729
Even a low wage
fast food job


232
00:11:05.773 --> 00:11:08.384
will attract
hundreds of applicants.


233
00:11:08.427 --> 00:11:11.300
- In the past,
the American dream was defined


234
00:11:11.343 --> 00:11:12.867
and it was defined as
you go to work,


235
00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.738
anyone can make it,
work really hard,


236
00:11:14.782 --> 00:11:16.131
save for a house,
save for a car,


237
00:11:16.174 --> 00:11:18.698
save for your family
and you'll be okay.


238
00:11:18.742 --> 00:11:21.571
And I think that all of that's
out of the window now.


239
00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:25.793
Everything's been thrown out
and there's no definition.


240
00:11:25.836 --> 00:11:27.403
I think that young people today

241
00:11:27.446 --> 00:11:31.450
are facing a completely
different reality.


242
00:11:31.494 --> 00:11:32.974
NARRATOR:
One big change


243
00:11:33.017 --> 00:11:35.063
is that responsibility
for standing out in a crowd


244
00:11:35.106 --> 00:11:37.848
falls entirely
to the job seeker.


245
00:11:37.892 --> 00:11:39.850
Initiative
and entrepreneurial spirit


246
00:11:39.894 --> 00:11:41.983
are the winning qualities.

247
00:11:43.158 --> 00:11:44.333
- And so, if you have an idea

248
00:11:44.376 --> 00:11:46.378
that you want to get into
this industry


249
00:11:46.422 --> 00:11:48.424
or that you want to work
with this employer,


250
00:11:48.467 --> 00:11:51.035
find out what kind of things
you can be doing right now,


251
00:11:51.079 --> 00:11:53.037
to make yourself stand out

252
00:11:53.081 --> 00:11:54.647
when your resume
lands on the pile


253
00:11:54.691 --> 00:11:56.258
or your application
comes through,


254
00:11:56.301 --> 00:11:58.347
you put in some work,
you volunteered,


255
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.349
you've taken this course,
you've read this book,


256
00:12:00.392 --> 00:12:02.525
you've done this thing
that now makes you


257
00:12:02.568 --> 00:12:04.353
a little bit more compelling

258
00:12:04.396 --> 00:12:05.441
than the person
that just sent out


259
00:12:05.484 --> 00:12:08.139
40 identical resumes
on Indeed.com.


260
00:12:09.619 --> 00:12:11.490
NARRATOR: The American dream
was primarily focused on


261
00:12:11.534 --> 00:12:13.449
providing a better
and more secure life


262
00:12:13.492 --> 00:12:15.668
for one's immediate family.

263
00:12:15.712 --> 00:12:18.236
Perhaps the scope
in this new century


264
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.110
has broadened out to society
and the planet as a whole.


265
00:12:22.153 --> 00:12:25.548
Profit is still required,
but in a totally new way.


266
00:12:25.591 --> 00:12:27.550
Making a better society

267
00:12:27.593 --> 00:12:29.987
has become the purpose
of our careers.


268
00:12:35.601 --> 00:12:37.734
If there is one place
where the American dream


269
00:12:37.777 --> 00:12:40.215
seems to have failed
on its promise,


270
00:12:40.258 --> 00:12:42.608
it is the expectation
that a university degree


271
00:12:42.652 --> 00:12:44.567
leads to prosperity.

272
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:46.874
The frustration is palpable
for millennials,


273
00:12:46.917 --> 00:12:48.179
many of whom find themselves

274
00:12:48.223 --> 00:12:50.399
saddled with
crushing student loans


275
00:12:50.442 --> 00:12:52.923
and degrees that have
little market value.


276
00:12:52.967 --> 00:12:58.537
In the U.S., student loan debt
is a staggering $1.2 trillion.


277
00:12:58.581 --> 00:13:02.628
That's an average
of $27,000 per student.


278
00:13:02.672 --> 00:13:03.803
That has many students

279
00:13:03.847 --> 00:13:06.676
questioning
the university degree.


280
00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:08.808
And yet,
in the new world economy,


281
00:13:08.852 --> 00:13:10.723
education is vital.

282
00:13:10.767 --> 00:13:12.682
Is it the degree
that is in question


283
00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:14.640
or the kind of degree?

284
00:13:14.684 --> 00:13:16.033
What kind of learning
will be essential


285
00:13:16.077 --> 00:13:18.514
in the coming generation?

286
00:13:18.557 --> 00:13:20.995
- We're calling the bluff
of the people who said famous,


287
00:13:21.038 --> 00:13:23.345
"College, debt,
do what you're told,


288
00:13:23.388 --> 00:13:25.913
number two pencil,
standardized tests."


289
00:13:25.956 --> 00:13:27.218
That instead,

290
00:13:27.262 --> 00:13:29.742
education's more important now
than ever before


291
00:13:29.786 --> 00:13:32.354
but education needs to take
two forms.


292
00:13:32.397 --> 00:13:35.139
One, how to solve
interesting problems


293
00:13:35.183 --> 00:13:37.141
and two, how to lead.

294
00:13:39.404 --> 00:13:40.884
NARRATOR:
The American dream provided


295
00:13:40.928 --> 00:13:43.408
basic universal education,

296
00:13:43.452 --> 00:13:45.976
but the future will require
personal skills


297
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.891
as well as subject content.

298
00:13:49.414 --> 00:13:52.243
IAN FOGARTY: Education has been
trying to disseminate


299
00:13:52.287 --> 00:13:54.767
a body of knowledge
into a person


300
00:13:54.811 --> 00:13:57.814
that was useful
for their future


301
00:13:57.857 --> 00:14:00.512
and now, students
have a variety of futures


302
00:14:00.556 --> 00:14:02.079
that I can't predict,

303
00:14:02.123 --> 00:14:04.864
and there's no way
that I can give them


304
00:14:04.908 --> 00:14:06.692
all the information
that they need


305
00:14:06.736 --> 00:14:09.434
for the variety of paths
that they're going to follow.


306
00:14:11.697 --> 00:14:13.308
It becomes a question of,

307
00:14:13.351 --> 00:14:16.528
"How can I use my content
that I'm required to teach


308
00:14:16.572 --> 00:14:18.661
to also teach other skills?"

309
00:14:28.976 --> 00:14:31.152
NARRATOR: Fogarty agrees
with Seth Godin's assessment,


310
00:14:31.195 --> 00:14:33.328
that traditional teaching
has failed to promote


311
00:14:33.371 --> 00:14:36.896
one of the most important skills
needed for the new generation:


312
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.030
entrepreneurial spirit.

313
00:14:40.074 --> 00:14:41.945
IAN: We have students
often coming in


314
00:14:41.989 --> 00:14:44.817
from the earlier years
where they are told to do this


315
00:14:44.861 --> 00:14:47.211
and what to do and when to do
and how to do it,


316
00:14:47.255 --> 00:14:51.346
and eventually we kind of
give them these broad questions


317
00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:54.697
and not necessarily tell them
how to do things and say,


318
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.568
"Well I'm not really going to
help you out a whole lot


319
00:14:56.612 --> 00:14:57.830
other than to guide you,

320
00:14:57.874 --> 00:14:59.267
maybe I'll give you
a phone number


321
00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.312
of somebody I know
who can help."


322
00:15:01.356 --> 00:15:04.446
"We can call somebody
outside the classroom?"


323
00:15:08.189 --> 00:15:09.581
Eventually they start cluing in

324
00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:12.802
that they can call
the minister of this


325
00:15:12.845 --> 00:15:14.847
and they can start
using handles


326
00:15:14.891 --> 00:15:17.111
in talking to
government officials


327
00:15:17.154 --> 00:15:19.722
and business people,
and we can go and get stuff


328
00:15:19.765 --> 00:15:21.854
and there's resources
out there to work with


329
00:15:21.898 --> 00:15:25.075
and go outside the school.

330
00:15:25.119 --> 00:15:29.601
And it doesn't take very long
if you're deliberate about it.


331
00:15:29.645 --> 00:15:31.125
So I think it's teachable

332
00:15:31.168 --> 00:15:33.562
and there's lots of examples
of students who have said,


333
00:15:33.605 --> 00:15:35.999
"I have confidence now,
I learned physics,


334
00:15:36.043 --> 00:15:37.479
but I learned confidence."

335
00:15:37.522 --> 00:15:38.567
"I learned how to network."

336
00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:39.916
"I learned physics,

337
00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:41.700
but I learned
how to collaborate


338
00:15:41.744 --> 00:15:45.530
and that I can make
a change in the world."


339
00:15:45.574 --> 00:15:47.793
One example
that I can think of,


340
00:15:47.837 --> 00:15:52.842
a student, her mom is an amputee
and she has a prosthetic leg,


341
00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:54.452
the student recognizes

342
00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:56.237
that there's lots of people
out there who don't have,


343
00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.719
and so can she create
a 3D printed prosthetic?


344
00:16:05.202 --> 00:16:09.554
Can she take it a step further
and create a bioelectric arm


345
00:16:09.598 --> 00:16:11.817
and instead of it costing
thousands of dollars,


346
00:16:11.861 --> 00:16:15.038
can they have it cost
a couple hundred dollars?


347
00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:20.304
So she worked really hard
to learn not my content,


348
00:16:20.348 --> 00:16:22.045
because my content
had nothing to do with coding,


349
00:16:22.089 --> 00:16:23.829
it had nothing to do
with Arduinos.


350
00:16:23.873 --> 00:16:25.744
So she learned how to code.

351
00:16:25.788 --> 00:16:27.877
She took an EKG sensor
and cut off the ends


352
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.792
and stuck it to some muscles,

353
00:16:29.835 --> 00:16:32.142
and found guitar strings
and tied them together


354
00:16:32.186 --> 00:16:35.885
and created this arm
that would move based on muscle,


355
00:16:35.928 --> 00:16:38.366
all for
a couple hundred dollars.


356
00:16:38.409 --> 00:16:40.107
It brought meaning
to her learning


357
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.934
because she was doing it
for some unknown person


358
00:16:41.978 --> 00:16:45.416
that was similar to her mom.

359
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.244
NARRATOR: Problem solving,
leadership,


360
00:16:47.288 --> 00:16:49.594
thoughtfulness,
and entrepreneurial spirit


361
00:16:49.638 --> 00:16:52.945
will be the skills
of the new workplace.


362
00:16:52.989 --> 00:16:55.034
Successful education
will be where


363
00:16:55.078 --> 00:16:57.298
these are taught
and encouraged.


364
00:17:03.347 --> 00:17:06.307
- Universities need to respond
to this new economy


365
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:09.048
and a lot of them
are struggling,


366
00:17:09.092 --> 00:17:11.660
but there are a few that are
taking leadership roles


367
00:17:11.703 --> 00:17:12.835
and figuring out

368
00:17:12.878 --> 00:17:14.358
"How do we tackle
some of these issues?


369
00:17:14.402 --> 00:17:17.883
How do we make change
in a large institution


370
00:17:17.927 --> 00:17:20.669
where change is a challenge?"

371
00:17:20.712 --> 00:17:23.802
NARRATOR: There has been
an explosion of online courses,


372
00:17:23.846 --> 00:17:26.109
but Karina LeBlanc
still believes strongly


373
00:17:26.153 --> 00:17:30.200
in the irreplaceable value of
the brick and mortar campus.


374
00:17:30.244 --> 00:17:32.028
- Technology can allow us
to connect in a way


375
00:17:32.071 --> 00:17:33.551
that we never have before,

376
00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:36.902
but there simply is nothing
that can replace the magic


377
00:17:36.946 --> 00:17:40.689
of face to face communications
and working in teams and groups


378
00:17:40.732 --> 00:17:43.213
to solve complex problems.

379
00:17:43.257 --> 00:17:45.041
Here at the University
of New Brunswick,


380
00:17:45.084 --> 00:17:46.347
we have a great example

381
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.045
of an organization
called Resson Aerospace,


382
00:17:49.088 --> 00:17:51.700
which is a startup
around big data


383
00:17:51.743 --> 00:17:54.355
where an engineering graduate
and a business graduate


384
00:17:54.398 --> 00:17:56.966
cofounded and created
this venture.


385
00:17:57.009 --> 00:17:58.663
They never would have
met each other


386
00:17:58.707 --> 00:18:01.362
if they didn't sit
in the same classroom together


387
00:18:01.405 --> 00:18:02.798
in these interdisciplinary

388
00:18:02.841 --> 00:18:05.888
experiential learning
opportunities.


389
00:18:05.931 --> 00:18:08.760
Universities are the epicenter
of innovation.


390
00:18:08.804 --> 00:18:12.199
They are where we are going to
start the conversation


391
00:18:12.242 --> 00:18:16.246
about solving
our most complex problems.


392
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.031
They have access to
world class research


393
00:18:19.075 --> 00:18:21.599
and are surrounded by
staff and faculty


394
00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:25.603
that want to see these students
succeed in their futures.


395
00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:27.126
What's different now

396
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.477
is that the student
is in the driver's seat.


397
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.261
It's no longer a prescribed,

398
00:18:31.305 --> 00:18:34.264
"Take this, do that,
and you will get this job."


399
00:18:34.308 --> 00:18:36.266
It's a "You must seek out
the opportunities


400
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.269
that allow you to figure out
what it is that you want,


401
00:18:39.313 --> 00:18:41.967
what is your passion,
and how are you going to get


402
00:18:42.011 --> 00:18:44.361
the skills you need
to pursue your passion?"


403
00:18:46.015 --> 00:18:48.452
NARRATOR: All seem to agree
it is vital that students


404
00:18:48.496 --> 00:18:51.238
take responsibility
for their own education.


405
00:19:07.602 --> 00:19:10.213
The engine that once powered
the American dream


406
00:19:10.257 --> 00:19:13.085
is now largely
being built offshore.


407
00:19:13.129 --> 00:19:16.219
One indicator
is the manufacturing sector.


408
00:19:16.263 --> 00:19:18.787
In 1965, manufacturing
accounted for


409
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:22.791
53% of the U.S. economy.
By 2004,


410
00:19:22.834 --> 00:19:25.489
it accounted for just 9%.

411
00:19:25.533 --> 00:19:27.143
But success
in the new economy


412
00:19:27.186 --> 00:19:29.972
is less about the type of
product or service being offered


413
00:19:30.015 --> 00:19:32.061
and more about why
companies are in business


414
00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:34.368
in the first place.

415
00:19:34.411 --> 00:19:37.806
And even the giants of the past
are reexamining the social


416
00:19:37.849 --> 00:19:41.157
and environmental impact
of their operations.


417
00:19:43.028 --> 00:19:45.944
SETH: We are now in
this postindustrial era


418
00:19:45.988 --> 00:19:48.991
where one of the jobs is
clean up some of what


419
00:19:49.034 --> 00:19:52.516
the industrial era left behind
in its rush to be cheap,


420
00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.126
and number two is figure out

421
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.520
how to create meaning
in what people do


422
00:19:56.564 --> 00:19:58.566
because we're not able to
buy as much stuff,


423
00:19:58.609 --> 00:20:00.219
either because
we've bought it already,


424
00:20:00.263 --> 00:20:02.309
we don't have a place to put it,
or we're out of money.


425
00:20:03.614 --> 00:20:04.702
NARRATOR:
In recent years,


426
00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:05.747
there has been
significant growth


427
00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.488
in a new kind of company:

428
00:20:07.531 --> 00:20:10.534
Companies that have more than
one bottom line.


429
00:20:10.578 --> 00:20:13.755
Profit is vital, but so are
the planet and people.


430
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.415
In a small Ontario
farming town of 2,000,


431
00:20:21.458 --> 00:20:23.068
Beau's Brewery
is a prime example


432
00:20:23.112 --> 00:20:25.114
of a new economy company.

433
00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:26.985
Since opening nine years ago,

434
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:28.683
Beau's has experienced
rocketing sales


435
00:20:28.726 --> 00:20:30.989
in the crowded
craft beer market.


436
00:20:32.687 --> 00:20:35.820
- Most of our customers
start their relationship with us


437
00:20:35.864 --> 00:20:38.519
because they like the beer,
but there's that moment


438
00:20:38.562 --> 00:20:41.130
where they turn from
being customers into fans


439
00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:43.219
and that's usually
when they find out


440
00:20:43.262 --> 00:20:45.787
something really wonderful
about us.


441
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.355
"Oh, it's organic.
Oh, that's really cool.


442
00:20:48.398 --> 00:20:50.400
"Oh, and you guys
supported this charity


443
00:20:50.444 --> 00:20:51.836
"that I really believe in.

444
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.577
Well, that's really cool."

445
00:20:53.621 --> 00:20:56.232
And, "Oh, you're doing that
initiative for the environment."


446
00:20:56.275 --> 00:21:00.802
It explains why we can grow
by over 40% a year


447
00:21:00.845 --> 00:21:04.632
while having pretty much a
zero-dollar advertising budget.


448
00:21:04.675 --> 00:21:06.895
Word of mouth really only works

449
00:21:06.938 --> 00:21:09.027
if you give people something
really cool to say.


450
00:21:10.725 --> 00:21:12.509
NARRATOR: The bottom line
for emerging companies


451
00:21:12.553 --> 00:21:15.773
is that making money
is not the only goal.


452
00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:19.081
STEVE: The idea of maximizing
shareholder value


453
00:21:19.124 --> 00:21:21.997
being the only purpose
for business


454
00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.434
just never really
rang true to me.


455
00:21:24.478 --> 00:21:27.437
Don't get me wrong,
if we can't keep the lights on,


456
00:21:27.481 --> 00:21:28.612
everything goes away.

457
00:21:28.656 --> 00:21:31.049
So it's important to focus

458
00:21:31.093 --> 00:21:33.095
on the first
of the three bottom lines,


459
00:21:33.138 --> 00:21:35.445
but if that's all
that you're doing,


460
00:21:35.489 --> 00:21:39.188
there's really, to my mind,
no reason for you to exist.


461
00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:42.583
NARRATOR: Positive social impact
is the second bottom line.


462
00:21:42.626 --> 00:21:44.454
New economy companies
view employees


463
00:21:44.498 --> 00:21:47.457
as team members who take on
big responsibility,


464
00:21:47.501 --> 00:21:51.940
but are rewarded with
high job satisfaction.


465
00:21:51.983 --> 00:21:57.728
- We give people realistic
but difficult objectives


466
00:21:57.772 --> 00:22:00.252
and encourage them
and give them the resources


467
00:22:00.296 --> 00:22:02.603
and the support they need
to achieve them,


468
00:22:02.646 --> 00:22:06.128
and then it's up to them
to make it happen.


469
00:22:07.608 --> 00:22:10.741
While it's very empowering,
it's also,


470
00:22:10.785 --> 00:22:12.787
for a lot of people,
very scary


471
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:16.181
if they've not been in that
kind of work environment before.


472
00:22:16.225 --> 00:22:17.835
SARAH:
Our best type of worker


473
00:22:17.879 --> 00:22:21.622
is somebody that almost has
an entrepreneurial type spirit,


474
00:22:21.665 --> 00:22:24.755
somebody that can
take their initiative,


475
00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:26.148
you need to get your job done

476
00:22:26.191 --> 00:22:29.630
and you are responsible
for your deliverables,


477
00:22:29.673 --> 00:22:32.807
but at the same time,
you don't feel


478
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.896
crushing pressure on yourself
by any means


479
00:22:34.939 --> 00:22:36.593
while you're working here.

480
00:22:36.637 --> 00:22:38.160
You work hard because
you want to work hard,


481
00:22:38.203 --> 00:22:40.902
because you want the company
to succeed.


482
00:22:40.945 --> 00:22:42.381
NARRATOR:
It's motivated workers


483
00:22:42.425 --> 00:22:46.168
colliding with a demanding
but inspiring workplace.


484
00:22:46.211 --> 00:22:47.996
Beau's was the first
brewery in Canada


485
00:22:48.039 --> 00:22:50.825
to achieve B Corp status.

486
00:22:50.868 --> 00:22:54.263
B Corp is an association
of triple bottom line companies


487
00:22:54.306 --> 00:22:55.786
that share this understanding

488
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.528
that business must care
for the environment,


489
00:22:58.572 --> 00:23:00.356
be a benefit
to its employees,


490
00:23:00.399 --> 00:23:03.664
and be a positive social agent
as it earns profit.


491
00:23:05.535 --> 00:23:08.364
- People quite often ask,
"How can you afford to do that?"


492
00:23:08.407 --> 00:23:10.279
And you really reverse
that question around,


493
00:23:10.322 --> 00:23:12.934
it's if we weren't doing that,

494
00:23:12.977 --> 00:23:14.849
almost all of this
wouldn't exist.


495
00:23:19.593 --> 00:23:21.812
And in a crowded marketplace

496
00:23:21.856 --> 00:23:23.945
where there's lots of
great beer out there,


497
00:23:23.988 --> 00:23:26.556
having all of the extra things
that we do


498
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.559
is maybe that one extra reason
someone buys our beer


499
00:23:29.603 --> 00:23:31.996
or one extra reason for them
to talk about our beer


500
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.607
to someone else,

501
00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:38.046
and all those one extra reasons
really start adding up.


502
00:23:38.089 --> 00:23:39.395
Companies that do
the right thing


503
00:23:39.438 --> 00:23:40.527
for the right reason

504
00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.354
tend to outperform
everyone else.


505
00:23:44.008 --> 00:23:46.533
NARRATOR: Rather than joining
the race to the bottom,


506
00:23:46.576 --> 00:23:48.926
or exalting profit
above all else,


507
00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:52.147
B Corps and their like
point the way toward a dream


508
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:55.237
of a just society,
a healthier planet,


509
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.544
and maybe a better life.

510
00:24:06.553 --> 00:24:08.424
Where do I want to live?

511
00:24:08.467 --> 00:24:11.862
For decades, the global trend
has been towards cities,


512
00:24:11.906 --> 00:24:14.909
but in recent years,
city planners, demographers,


513
00:24:14.952 --> 00:24:17.781
and real estate agents
have seen signs of a change.


514
00:24:17.825 --> 00:24:19.870
Not for movement to the city,

515
00:24:19.914 --> 00:24:23.265
but away from that unique
post war invention,


516
00:24:23.308 --> 00:24:25.572
the modern suburb.

517
00:24:25.615 --> 00:24:28.487
The single family suburban home
with its white picket fence


518
00:24:28.531 --> 00:24:31.839
has been the archetype
of the American dream.


519
00:24:31.882 --> 00:24:34.755
What is replacing it, and why?

520
00:24:34.798 --> 00:24:35.756
- There was a tipping point.

521
00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:37.018
There was a point in time

522
00:24:37.061 --> 00:24:39.803
where those promises
that suburbia offered


523
00:24:39.847 --> 00:24:41.239
didn't deliver.

524
00:24:41.544 --> 00:24:43.981
We had been building cities
a certain way


525
00:24:44.025 --> 00:24:46.505
and have refined
and perfected it


526
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:47.898
over hundreds of years,

527
00:24:47.942 --> 00:24:49.987
and we completely
turned our backs on it


528
00:24:50.031 --> 00:24:52.599
over the course of 20/30 years.

529
00:24:52.642 --> 00:24:55.950
And not surprisingly,
it doesn't work.


530
00:25:01.042 --> 00:25:03.784
NARRATOR: Cities have been
messy and chaotic,


531
00:25:03.827 --> 00:25:06.613
but there was an underlying
wisdom to them


532
00:25:06.656 --> 00:25:08.571
and that wisdom
gave them their character.


533
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:15.056
HAROLD: It's a city that was
really about proximity,


534
00:25:15.099 --> 00:25:18.494
compact, walkable,
fine grained


535
00:25:18.537 --> 00:25:20.409
in terms of its block
and street pattern,


536
00:25:20.452 --> 00:25:22.629
and so everything was
human scaled, as they call it.


537
00:25:24.021 --> 00:25:26.981
Most amenities
and services and shops


538
00:25:27.024 --> 00:25:29.679
and places of residents,
places of work,


539
00:25:29.723 --> 00:25:32.029
were often within
walking distances.


540
00:25:32.073 --> 00:25:33.727
The entire city was really one

541
00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.686
that was designed and measured
to that of the human being.


542
00:25:38.122 --> 00:25:40.647
We have places like Paris,
which some would consider


543
00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.388
the most civilized dense city
in the first world.


544
00:25:43.432 --> 00:25:46.914
I mean, roughly 29,000 people
per square kilometer,


545
00:25:46.957 --> 00:25:48.480
far more dense
than even Manhattan.


546
00:25:54.051 --> 00:25:57.228
People living in
multiple unit buildings,


547
00:25:57.272 --> 00:25:59.970
roughly six to eight stories
in height.


548
00:26:00.014 --> 00:26:01.537
Not a lot of private space.

549
00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.539
Not even a lot of outdoor
private space.


550
00:26:03.582 --> 00:26:04.975
Almost none to speak of.

551
00:26:05.019 --> 00:26:08.805
But extended commonly shared
public spaces.


552
00:26:10.589 --> 00:26:11.982
NARRATOR: While there has
always been housing


553
00:26:12.026 --> 00:26:14.071
on the edges
of the world's great cities,


554
00:26:14.115 --> 00:26:16.900
the North American suburb
was not a natural extension,


555
00:26:16.944 --> 00:26:18.641
but a soulless aberration.

556
00:26:20.208 --> 00:26:21.339
HAROLD:
In the postwar era,


557
00:26:21.383 --> 00:26:22.297
what we saw
in North American cities


558
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.255
was complete transformation:

559
00:26:25.779 --> 00:26:27.737
the suburban dream.

560
00:26:27.781 --> 00:26:30.871
Your own single detached house
in the countryside,


561
00:26:30.914 --> 00:26:33.830
near the greenery,
access by car,


562
00:26:33.874 --> 00:26:36.877
and amongst neighbors
like yourselves.


563
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.967
Virtually and in reality,
you couldn't tell them apart.


564
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.709
You could be dropped
in one part of North America,


565
00:26:42.752 --> 00:26:44.319
and thousands of miles away

566
00:26:44.362 --> 00:26:45.537
in another part
of North America,


567
00:26:45.581 --> 00:26:47.670
and you wouldn't
know the difference.


568
00:26:47.714 --> 00:26:50.455
They were placeless places.

569
00:26:50.499 --> 00:26:52.719
NARRATOR: The unanticipated
result of the suburb


570
00:26:52.762 --> 00:26:56.418
was social deterioration
at the heart of cities.


571
00:26:56.461 --> 00:26:58.246
HAROLD: Some people talk about
the donut effect,


572
00:26:58.289 --> 00:27:01.249
the kind of leaving behind
of the underclass


573
00:27:01.292 --> 00:27:05.166
or the lower class at the time
in the inner cities,


574
00:27:05.209 --> 00:27:07.255
resulted in a stigmatization

575
00:27:07.298 --> 00:27:10.214
across a whole range
of social dimensions.


576
00:27:12.434 --> 00:27:13.696
NARRATOR:
The American style suburb


577
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.003
is not likely to disappear
quickly,


578
00:27:16.046 --> 00:27:17.744
but realtors have been
noticing a swing


579
00:27:17.787 --> 00:27:20.137
back to living downtown again.

580
00:27:20.181 --> 00:27:21.312
HAROLD:
When you look at where


581
00:27:21.356 --> 00:27:23.401
millennials
are choosing to live,


582
00:27:23.445 --> 00:27:26.840
they are drawn to
what are best examples


583
00:27:26.883 --> 00:27:29.799
of refined urban developments,

584
00:27:29.843 --> 00:27:32.628
which are the old
traditional neighborhoods


585
00:27:32.671 --> 00:27:34.456
within walking distance
of schools


586
00:27:34.499 --> 00:27:36.545
and a vibrant Main Street

587
00:27:36.588 --> 00:27:39.200
that has all the services
and amenities that you'd want,


588
00:27:39.243 --> 00:27:41.550
many of them
in Ma and Pa type stores.


589
00:27:41.593 --> 00:27:44.248
It's about not wasting time
commuting,


590
00:27:44.292 --> 00:27:46.337
it's about affordability,

591
00:27:46.381 --> 00:27:48.687
being close to your peers
and your community.


592
00:27:50.907 --> 00:27:54.650
That's why we see the downtowns
across North America


593
00:27:54.693 --> 00:27:57.305
in a renaissance right now.

594
00:27:57.348 --> 00:28:00.308
Toronto, very much
symptomatic of that.


595
00:28:00.351 --> 00:28:01.962
The downtown is growing
at four times the rate


596
00:28:02.005 --> 00:28:03.485
of the rest of the city,

597
00:28:03.528 --> 00:28:05.226
thousands of new units
are being added,


598
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:06.705
and there's no end in sight.

599
00:28:09.752 --> 00:28:11.014
We've come 360.

600
00:28:11.058 --> 00:28:13.060
In many ways,
there is a rejection


601
00:28:13.103 --> 00:28:16.106
of our parents'
sense of success


602
00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:17.891
and a kind of return back

603
00:28:17.934 --> 00:28:22.025
to kind of more traditional
ways of living in the city.


604
00:28:22.069 --> 00:28:24.898
NARRATOR: What are the housing
options for urban living?


605
00:28:24.941 --> 00:28:27.335
What is happening as a result
of the increased interest


606
00:28:27.378 --> 00:28:29.337
in urban neighborhoods?

607
00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.078
What choices
face recent graduates


608
00:28:31.121 --> 00:28:33.080
who are often burdened by debt?

609
00:28:39.129 --> 00:28:40.783
BRANDON: The average price
of a detached home in Toronto


610
00:28:40.827 --> 00:28:42.959
now I think
is around $1.2 million.


611
00:28:43.003 --> 00:28:44.874
That's increasingly
becoming unaffordable


612
00:28:44.918 --> 00:28:46.571
for a lot of people.

613
00:28:46.615 --> 00:28:48.965
You can get a three-bedroom
condo for far less than that.


614
00:28:49.009 --> 00:28:51.446
So I think you'll start to see
people make those tradeoffs.


615
00:28:51.489 --> 00:28:53.535
It's a smaller place
in the city,


616
00:28:53.578 --> 00:28:55.102
it's more affordable now,

617
00:28:55.145 --> 00:28:57.278
and I'm going to make
that decision.


618
00:28:57.321 --> 00:28:58.888
NARRATOR:
For cities like Toronto,


619
00:28:58.932 --> 00:29:02.065
condos are the entry point
to homeownership for many,


620
00:29:02.109 --> 00:29:05.460
but increasingly, they are
a lifestyle choice as well.


621
00:29:05.503 --> 00:29:09.116
- I think there's this fixation
that you need to be a homeowner.


622
00:29:09.159 --> 00:29:10.595
It's this rite of passage,

623
00:29:10.639 --> 00:29:13.294
it's the way that you climb
the socioeconomic ladder,


624
00:29:13.337 --> 00:29:15.687
but that's not necessarily
the case.


625
00:29:15.731 --> 00:29:17.037
There's a lot of other countries

626
00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.908
that don't have
the same homeownership rates


627
00:29:18.952 --> 00:29:20.388
and these are
really wealthy countries,


628
00:29:20.431 --> 00:29:23.304
Germany, Switzerland,
these are rich countries.


629
00:29:23.347 --> 00:29:25.262
You can have a country,
you can have a place


630
00:29:25.306 --> 00:29:27.395
where most people,
for the majority, rent,


631
00:29:27.438 --> 00:29:31.181
and you can still
do economically well.


632
00:29:31.225 --> 00:29:33.270
NARRATOR: Where homeownership
was once viewed as security,


633
00:29:33.314 --> 00:29:37.187
it is coming to be viewed
by some as a burden.


634
00:29:37.231 --> 00:29:39.973
BRANDON: I've spoken to people
who are wealthy professionals


635
00:29:40.016 --> 00:29:42.671
that could very easily
buy homes,


636
00:29:42.714 --> 00:29:44.020
doctors, lawyers, et cetera,

637
00:29:44.064 --> 00:29:46.283
and they're renting,
and they're fine with that.


638
00:29:48.242 --> 00:29:52.159
People value experiences
over material things.


639
00:29:52.202 --> 00:29:54.857
There's a mindset that I'd like
to be able to shut my door


640
00:29:54.901 --> 00:29:57.338
and go travel for a month
if I want to,


641
00:29:57.381 --> 00:30:00.471
and not worry about maintenance
and looking after my property


642
00:30:00.515 --> 00:30:02.343
and all those types of things,
so there's a freedom element.


643
00:30:05.041 --> 00:30:08.262
Previous generations were so set
on owning all of these things


644
00:30:08.305 --> 00:30:10.438
and it almost kind of
ties you down and restricts you,


645
00:30:10.481 --> 00:30:12.962
and it doesn't liberate you
in the same way.


646
00:30:13.006 --> 00:30:16.096
NARRATOR: It was the car
that gave birth to the suburb,


647
00:30:16.139 --> 00:30:17.967
but with a return
to the downtown,


648
00:30:18.011 --> 00:30:19.795
many are abandoning
car ownership


649
00:30:19.838 --> 00:30:22.754
for economic,
convenience, fitness,


650
00:30:22.798 --> 00:30:24.887
and environmental reasons.

651
00:30:24.931 --> 00:30:27.324
BRANDON: I know for me,
I hate driving.


652
00:30:27.368 --> 00:30:31.807
If I can avoid it, I do,
and versus 15 years ago,


653
00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:34.201
growing up in the kind of
suburbs of Toronto,


654
00:30:34.244 --> 00:30:36.246
a car was the biggest thing
in the world.


655
00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:38.814
Getting your license
and getting your own car


656
00:30:38.857 --> 00:30:40.990
was your ticket to freedom.

657
00:30:41.034 --> 00:30:43.514
Now, it almost feels like
a liability.


658
00:30:43.558 --> 00:30:44.820
NARRATOR:
Whether it's through renting,


659
00:30:44.863 --> 00:30:47.127
owning a condo
or buying a house,


660
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:49.433
many are trading in
the long commute by car


661
00:30:49.477 --> 00:30:51.261
and choosing
the energy, culture,


662
00:30:51.305 --> 00:30:53.220
and proximity
of downtown living.


663
00:30:55.439 --> 00:30:57.006
BRANDON: There will be
a stronger kind of affinity


664
00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:58.790
towards center city
neighborhoods


665
00:30:58.834 --> 00:31:01.532
for certainly the kind of
younger generation


666
00:31:01.576 --> 00:31:03.447
that's kind of growing up
and spending their kind of


667
00:31:03.491 --> 00:31:06.842
young professional years
in the city.


668
00:31:06.885 --> 00:31:09.018
NARRATOR: City planners
agree that it is not size


669
00:31:09.062 --> 00:31:11.412
that increasingly attracts
people to city centers,


670
00:31:11.455 --> 00:31:14.502
but the vibrancy, proximity
and arts and culture


671
00:31:14.545 --> 00:31:15.982
that are part of
the urban experience.


672
00:31:27.906 --> 00:31:30.953
NARRATOR: The marketplace is now
completely globalized.


673
00:31:30.997 --> 00:31:33.390
It is no more difficult to
purchase a product or service


674
00:31:33.434 --> 00:31:36.698
from another country
than it is from across town.


675
00:31:36.741 --> 00:31:38.961
Originally,
the American dream emphasized


676
00:31:39.005 --> 00:31:42.399
building quality products
and providing reliable service,


677
00:31:42.443 --> 00:31:43.705
but over decades,

678
00:31:43.748 --> 00:31:47.448
it became a pursuit
of the lowest price.


679
00:31:47.491 --> 00:31:50.755
Now, North American consumers
are increasingly concerned about


680
00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:54.716
quality and the social impact
of their shopping choices.


681
00:31:54.759 --> 00:31:56.544
More people want to know
the background


682
00:31:56.587 --> 00:31:58.459
to products on the shelf.

683
00:31:58.502 --> 00:32:00.678
There is a growing desire
for a personal connection


684
00:32:00.722 --> 00:32:03.681
to the products and services
we use.


685
00:32:03.725 --> 00:32:05.770
Nowhere is this seen
more clearly


686
00:32:05.814 --> 00:32:07.207
than around our food supply.

687
00:32:10.427 --> 00:32:12.255
[cow mooing]

688
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:15.737
LEVI:
Less than two generations ago,


689
00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:18.087
97% of the food we ate
in our community


690
00:32:18.131 --> 00:32:20.611
was grown also by the community
within an hour's distance.


691
00:32:29.272 --> 00:32:31.100
Then we moved into
a supermarket system


692
00:32:31.144 --> 00:32:32.536
where we get disconnected

693
00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.582
from the story of
where our food was made and how.


694
00:32:34.625 --> 00:32:36.758
People are just now realizing
that there should be a story.


695
00:32:38.542 --> 00:32:40.805
NARRATOR: In 2010,
Chef Levi Lawrence


696
00:32:40.849 --> 00:32:43.156
moved back to his home
in New Brunswick, Canada,


697
00:32:43.199 --> 00:32:44.940
to start
Real Food Connections.


698
00:32:49.249 --> 00:32:50.728
The idea was to make fresh,

699
00:32:50.772 --> 00:32:53.209
locally grown
farm market style food


700
00:32:53.253 --> 00:32:55.037
more available
to local restaurants,


701
00:32:55.081 --> 00:32:57.126
hotels and shoppers.

702
00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:00.651
He operates a grocery store,
an industrial kitchen,


703
00:33:00.695 --> 00:33:02.914
a wholesale delivery service,

704
00:33:02.958 --> 00:33:07.180
and has developed a network of
over 120 local food producers,


705
00:33:07.223 --> 00:33:09.269
mostly small scale farms.

706
00:33:09.312 --> 00:33:11.227
Every day, Levi sees
people's hunger


707
00:33:11.271 --> 00:33:13.229
to be more informed
about what they eat.


708
00:33:14.752 --> 00:33:16.058
LEVI: With the access
to the information


709
00:33:16.102 --> 00:33:17.755
you have on your phones
and on the internet,


710
00:33:17.799 --> 00:33:19.801
you can find out more
about how your TV's made


711
00:33:19.844 --> 00:33:22.412
than the food you buy
at the grocery store.


712
00:33:22.456 --> 00:33:24.501
You see that revolt
go back to youth now,


713
00:33:24.545 --> 00:33:26.242
that feel
they should be able to know


714
00:33:26.286 --> 00:33:27.722
how their food is being grown

715
00:33:27.765 --> 00:33:30.159
because it's something they know
grows in a local farm,


716
00:33:30.203 --> 00:33:31.639
but yet they're buying
their carrots from Jerusalem


717
00:33:31.682 --> 00:33:32.727
and they don't know
who picked it


718
00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:34.032
and what the life conditions
were.


719
00:33:35.817 --> 00:33:37.775
Generally, what we've promised
our customer


720
00:33:37.819 --> 00:33:40.996
is that we're going to find
an authentic business


721
00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:42.737
with a story
from New Brunswick


722
00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.131
that we can tell you who made it
and where it was made and how.


723
00:33:45.174 --> 00:33:47.394
We guarantee the authenticity
and the transparency.


724
00:33:50.353 --> 00:33:52.050
NARRATOR: Because of
the personal connection,


725
00:33:52.094 --> 00:33:55.576
Levi can vouch for environmental
and humane practices


726
00:33:55.619 --> 00:33:57.578
on the part of the farmers.

727
00:33:57.621 --> 00:33:59.188
LEVI:
You get into animals and meat


728
00:33:59.232 --> 00:34:00.842
and it becomes
a very serious conversation,


729
00:34:00.885 --> 00:34:02.235
a very complex one.

730
00:34:02.278 --> 00:34:03.410
We have a saying in our store

731
00:34:03.453 --> 00:34:05.412
that all of the local meat
we buy


732
00:34:05.455 --> 00:34:07.631
all had one great life
and one bad day.


733
00:34:10.068 --> 00:34:11.461
People are just
looking to replace


734
00:34:11.505 --> 00:34:14.247
complexity and risk
and danger and unknown


735
00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:16.336
with a story
they can relate to


736
00:34:16.379 --> 00:34:19.034
with communities and geography
that they can relate to.


737
00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:32.961
Why would you not buy local?

738
00:34:33.004 --> 00:34:35.006
It's often less expensive,

739
00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:37.792
you can connect and have
that assurance of quality


740
00:34:37.835 --> 00:34:39.185
because
you can meet the farmer.


741
00:34:40.882 --> 00:34:43.058
Giving control
of your financial decision


742
00:34:43.101 --> 00:34:44.233
over where your money goes

743
00:34:44.277 --> 00:34:45.843
and how much
the farmer gets paid


744
00:34:45.887 --> 00:34:49.064
to a large international
corporation,


745
00:34:49.107 --> 00:34:50.718
I don't think it's good
for anybody's economy.


746
00:34:50.761 --> 00:34:52.328
I don't think there's any small
community around the world


747
00:34:52.372 --> 00:34:54.330
that benefits from giving
those decisions away.


748
00:34:56.637 --> 00:34:58.900
Ninety-eight percent of
everything I sell in my store,


749
00:34:58.943 --> 00:34:59.770
I've paid a farmer.

750
00:35:21.314 --> 00:35:23.316
NARRATOR: Jason LeJeune
ownsIsaac's Way Restaurant


751
00:35:23.359 --> 00:35:25.709
in the city of Fredericton.

752
00:35:25.753 --> 00:35:27.842
Besides offering
fresh, local fare,


753
00:35:27.885 --> 00:35:29.496
the restaurant
quietly goes about


754
00:35:29.539 --> 00:35:32.063
supporting local charities
and promoting local producers.


755
00:35:34.152 --> 00:35:35.850
JASON: I think
people want to feel good


756
00:35:35.893 --> 00:35:37.547
about their
buying decisions now.


757
00:35:37.591 --> 00:35:40.550
So the independent restaurants
who are the independent grocer


758
00:35:40.594 --> 00:35:42.987
really can bring
to the market a specialty,


759
00:35:43.031 --> 00:35:44.815
local boutique product

760
00:35:44.859 --> 00:35:47.775
that the customer may not
have experienced before.


761
00:35:47.818 --> 00:35:52.083
So we support the local
cidery craft beer producers,


762
00:35:52.127 --> 00:35:53.911
so when you buy a beer here,

763
00:35:53.955 --> 00:35:56.697
you can't buy a Bud Light,
you can't buy a Corona,


764
00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.438
you can't buy a Guinness.

765
00:35:58.481 --> 00:36:01.397
We'll offer you good locally
produced substitutes of that,


766
00:36:01.441 --> 00:36:03.094
but that's where the head
of the market is that.


767
00:36:03.138 --> 00:36:04.531
It's been--
we do those things


768
00:36:04.574 --> 00:36:08.012
out of a wish to
support those producers,


769
00:36:08.056 --> 00:36:09.971
but also that's where
our customers are telling us


770
00:36:10.014 --> 00:36:11.581
that they want us to go.

771
00:36:11.625 --> 00:36:13.453
So we're trying to
lead the market,


772
00:36:13.496 --> 00:36:16.325
but we're also
following the market.


773
00:36:16.369 --> 00:36:17.979
NARRATOR:
Wherever makers do not have


774
00:36:18.022 --> 00:36:20.677
the economies of scale to
compete for the lowest prices,


775
00:36:20.721 --> 00:36:23.245
their greatest advantage
may be their unique story


776
00:36:23.289 --> 00:36:25.334
and the story of their product.

777
00:36:25.378 --> 00:36:27.031
It is this
that will win customers


778
00:36:27.075 --> 00:36:28.946
who are looking for
personal connection.


779
00:36:36.084 --> 00:36:39.261
Predicting the future has always
had a very low success rate,


780
00:36:39.305 --> 00:36:41.045
but these rising new values

781
00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:44.353
will almost certainly
direct the coming decades.


782
00:36:44.397 --> 00:36:46.224
- That is absolutely
I think the future.


783
00:36:46.268 --> 00:36:47.617
I think that we are
more and more


784
00:36:47.661 --> 00:36:50.228
looking to work with
and to be employed by


785
00:36:50.272 --> 00:36:52.927
organizations that are making
a difference in the world.


786
00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:55.451
- And it's going to be driven
by the students,


787
00:36:55.495 --> 00:36:58.193
by the citizens
who are demanding a difference


788
00:36:58.236 --> 00:37:00.456
in the way that they experience
their education


789
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.024
and in the way that they tap
into a future job market


790
00:37:03.067 --> 00:37:04.591
that's completely unknown.

791
00:37:04.634 --> 00:37:06.767
- As we do more things
for the right reason,


792
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:10.205
we seem to be rewarded
with more sales.


793
00:37:10.248 --> 00:37:12.816
- Young professionals,
retirees, empty nesters,


794
00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.297
they're just really flooding
back into the city


795
00:37:15.341 --> 00:37:16.559
and I think that's really
the big shift


796
00:37:16.603 --> 00:37:18.735
that's taking place right now.

797
00:37:18.779 --> 00:37:21.390
NARRATOR: Cities
that look to build vitality,


798
00:37:21.434 --> 00:37:24.437
regions that wish to attract
a vibrant workforce,


799
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.091
communities that want to
produce wellbeing,


800
00:37:27.135 --> 00:37:29.877
all need to pay attention
to these shifts.


801
00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.967
There are many traditional
regions across North America


802
00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:34.360
that have witnessed
an outmigration


803
00:37:34.403 --> 00:37:36.449
of the millennial generation.

804
00:37:36.492 --> 00:37:38.886
Reversing
that gravitational force


805
00:37:38.929 --> 00:37:43.064
is fantastically difficult,
but the concept is simple.


806
00:37:43.107 --> 00:37:46.154
Create a place people want to
work and live.


807
00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:47.634
That's not limited
to mega cities


808
00:37:47.677 --> 00:37:50.288
like New York
or San Francisco.


809
00:37:50.332 --> 00:37:52.247
The growth of buoyant culture

810
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:54.423
and the social capital
that goes with it


811
00:37:54.467 --> 00:37:57.948
can happen even in
smaller second tier cities,


812
00:37:57.992 --> 00:37:59.167
for it comes from something

813
00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:02.388
not dependent upon
population alone.


814
00:38:02.431 --> 00:38:06.653
- If somebody is curious,
is editing Wikipedia,


815
00:38:06.696 --> 00:38:08.698
is blogging on a regular basis,

816
00:38:08.742 --> 00:38:11.048
is organizing meet-ups
in their town,


817
00:38:11.092 --> 00:38:13.747
is figuring out
how to weave together


818
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:17.011
a fabric of community
where money isn't the point,


819
00:38:17.054 --> 00:38:19.535
the more we see that,

820
00:38:19.579 --> 00:38:21.494
the more we're moving
in the right direction.


821
00:38:23.757 --> 00:38:25.933
NARRATOR: The hope will lie
in making substantive changes


822
00:38:25.976 --> 00:38:28.196
in these critical areas,

823
00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:29.937
and what may help most

824
00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:33.027
is that these values
are at the core


825
00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:34.724
of what makes us human.

826
00:38:34.768 --> 00:38:37.640
[♪♪♪]

827
00:40:38.979 --> 00:40:42.025
- The American dream
is a hidden path to unhappiness.


828
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:45.899
- Always learning about
money, money, money, money.


829
00:40:45.942 --> 00:40:48.075
- Part of the Millennial dream
is to make an impact,


830
00:40:48.118 --> 00:40:49.816
to make positive change.

831
00:40:49.859 --> 00:40:52.166
- Having to do something
that you enjoy


832
00:40:52.209 --> 00:40:54.211
is much more satisfying.

833
00:40:54.255 --> 00:40:55.604
- We want to do what we love

834
00:40:55.648 --> 00:40:58.999
and we want to invest
in our community.


835
00:40:59.042 --> 00:41:00.783
- We all do find
true fulfillness


836
00:41:00.827 --> 00:41:02.045
through helping others.

837
