2
00:02:22.293 --> 00:02:23.668
Dharmendra!

3
00:02:23.752 --> 00:02:25.252
- Pick up these plates!

4
00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:27.627
Bring the potatoes
out when they're done.


5
00:02:27.793 --> 00:02:30.793
- Have you cleaned the bathroom?
- It was filthy yesterday!


6
00:02:35.918 --> 00:02:37.210
- Dharmendra!

7
00:02:37.377 --> 00:02:40.377
- Hang the clothes
to dry... the sun's out!


8
00:02:43.877 --> 00:02:45.418
Do you need anything, Dad?

9
00:02:48.127 --> 00:02:51.085
Forget your papers for a
minute and concentrate on him...


10
00:02:51.252 --> 00:02:54.377
He's been rehearsing
his death for a week now.


11
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.918
You think he listens to me?

12
00:02:56.043 --> 00:02:58.252
As if me saying anything
will make a difference...


13
00:02:58.627 --> 00:02:59.543
What the hell?

14
00:02:59.627 --> 00:03:02.210
Don't pour the damn tea
so close to the accounts papers!


15
00:03:02.293 --> 00:03:03.752
Ridiculous...

16
00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:06.752
All we have are accounts papers.

17
00:03:06.835 --> 00:03:08.377
God alone knows when
we'll see some money.


18
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.793
It'll come when these
snide comments stop.


19
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.793
Did you see this?

20
00:03:14.877 --> 00:03:16.793
Last month's electricity bill.

21
00:03:16.877 --> 00:03:18.252
6,478 rupees...

22
00:03:18.335 --> 00:03:20.002
Just one month,
not the whole year!


23
00:03:20.085 --> 00:03:22.710
Can't switch the damn
TV off for a second!


24
00:03:22.918 --> 00:03:23.960
"No money, no money!"

25
00:03:24.127 --> 00:03:25.252
I have an idea...

26
00:03:25.335 --> 00:03:26.752
Let's get rid of
the lights and fans...


27
00:03:26.877 --> 00:03:27.877
No electricity, no bill!

28
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.793
I said TV-Why can't
you give a straight answer?!


29
00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:33.127
By the way,
have you called the plumber?


30
00:03:34.085 --> 00:03:35.043
Oh, don't worry...

31
00:03:35.127 --> 00:03:36.918
The tap's only been
leaking for 3 days now...


32
00:03:37.002 --> 00:03:38.960
We'll call him when
the house is a pool.


33
00:03:39.043 --> 00:03:40.252
His number's right here.

34
00:03:40.335 --> 00:03:42.418
You too could have called him.

35
00:03:43.085 --> 00:03:44.710
This is the limit...

36
00:03:45.418 --> 00:03:46.793
Dharmendra!

37
00:03:47.085 --> 00:03:49.043
Go see what's happened now!

38
00:03:50.793 --> 00:03:54.168
Day before he was lying in
the lawn with ketchup on his chest.


39
00:03:54.377 --> 00:03:55.835
- When the neighbors came to check...

40
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.168
- he said let's go for dinner...
- I mean, really!


41
00:04:02.627 --> 00:04:04.085
I don't know what to say, Rahul!

42
00:04:04.168 --> 00:04:05.627
I don't know what
to tell the publishers!


43
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.460
Your deadline is in two months!

44
00:04:07.585 --> 00:04:09.252
Listen, I'm just
re-working the ending...


45
00:04:09.335 --> 00:04:10.918
I'm fixing the plot points...

46
00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:12.293
I wasn't quite happy with it.

47
00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:15.752
I've been a bit pre-occupied
with that Artist Retreat thing.


48
00:04:15.918 --> 00:04:18.793
I'm happy for you that the
Artist Retreat is coming together.


49
00:04:18.877 --> 00:04:21.918
I really am happy and I
know that you can multi-task...


50
00:04:22.085 --> 00:04:25.002
But right now I need a moment
as your agent and not as your friend.


51
00:04:25.085 --> 00:04:25.835
Okay?

52
00:04:25.918 --> 00:04:27.668
Listen, I'm not your friend;
I'm your agent...


53
00:04:27.752 --> 00:04:30.418
And as your agent I'm telling you,
that you're hot property right now.


54
00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:32.127
Your last book is
still on the shelves.


55
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.168
I've got you a sweet
deal for this new book...


56
00:04:34.252 --> 00:04:37.085
If you miss that deadline,
you have to return the advance.


57
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.210
Okay, I get it, I get.

58
00:04:38.293 --> 00:04:40.960
I promise in the next

59
00:04:41.127 --> 00:04:42.210
20 days!

60
00:04:42.377 --> 00:04:44.460
- 20 days.
- Oh, that reminds me...


61
00:04:44.543 --> 00:04:48.293
I need you to sign these
for my friends who love your work...


62
00:04:48.377 --> 00:04:51.460
I don't know why,
but I just need you to sign them.


63
00:04:52.043 --> 00:04:53.585
Oh... Just give me a second...

64
00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:54.752
It's my Dad.

65
00:04:54.835 --> 00:04:56.002
on! Say hi!

66
00:04:57.127 --> 00:04:58.377
Hi, Dad.

67
00:05:00.543 --> 00:05:01.668
What?!

68
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.793
Hey, Mike!
Two vodka's coming up!


69
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.710
Tonight's Ladies' Night!
You guys like the music?


70
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.293
I'll tell the DJ!

71
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.627
Cheers, guys!

72
00:05:16.752 --> 00:05:19.460
- Don't drink and drive, alright?!
- Yeah, we'll be safe. Hey, Mike!


73
00:05:24.668 --> 00:05:25.543
- Hey, Mike!

74
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.377
Working late tonight?

75
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.502
Hey... Yeah,
just sending a few e-mails...


76
00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:38.377
- Okay. See you tomorrow!
- Bye, see you tomorrow Natalie...


77
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.835
- Goodnight!
- Goodnight!


78
00:05:48.002 --> 00:05:49.210
Hello?

79
00:05:49.752 --> 00:05:51.085
Arjun, where are you, man?

80
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.002
Why aren't you
answering your phone?


81
00:05:53.085 --> 00:05:54.460
Why? What happened?

82
00:05:54.543 --> 00:05:56.793
Dad called...
Dadu's had a heart attack...


83
00:05:56.877 --> 00:05:57.793
Shit...

84
00:05:58.293 --> 00:05:59.252
ls he okay?

85
00:05:59.335 --> 00:06:02.293
Yeah, he's stable now...
But he's still in the ICU...


86
00:06:02.835 --> 00:06:04.085
Why didn't they call me?

87
00:06:04.502 --> 00:06:05.460
Arjun...

88
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.627
I don't have time
for your childishness.


89
00:06:07.877 --> 00:06:10.543
I'm taking an Air India
flight day after...


90
00:06:10.627 --> 00:06:11.418
It'll arrive at 2 pm.

91
00:06:11.502 --> 00:06:12.418
- And I checked...

92
00:06:12.502 --> 00:06:14.293
- If you take the 7.40 flight
from New Jersey...


93
00:06:14.377 --> 00:06:16.377
- we can leave
the airport together.


94
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.585
Hold on.

95
00:06:17.835 --> 00:06:21.668
7.40... New Jersey...

96
00:06:24.002 --> 00:06:25.168
Arjun...

97
00:06:25.377 --> 00:06:27.085
It's alright, man,
I can buy you the ticket...


98
00:06:27.418 --> 00:06:30.252
No need... I'll manage.
Bye.


99
00:06:31.502 --> 00:06:33.085
Okay fine... Bye.

100
00:06:56.668 --> 00:06:57.960
" Arjun!"

101
00:07:07.377 --> 00:07:08.668
How are you?

102
00:07:14.252 --> 00:07:15.502
Where's your bag?

103
00:07:29.543 --> 00:07:30.752
Hello?

104
00:07:31.627 --> 00:07:32.877
Where are you'll?

105
00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:34.543
- We're already here...

106
00:07:35.543 --> 00:07:38.668
- Can't find the keys...
- They aren't under the mat.


107
00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:42.627
Ahh... Found it.

108
00:07:43.002 --> 00:07:44.627
- Okay see you'll soon.

109
00:07:48.043 --> 00:07:49.377
Hey, Geishu!

110
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.418
Shake hands!
Yes! Good boy!


111
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.168
What's up?!

112
00:07:57.293 --> 00:07:58.918
- Missed you...

113
00:08:41.752 --> 00:08:43.085
What?

114
00:08:50.085 --> 00:08:51.002
Rahul!

115
00:08:51.085 --> 00:08:51.668
Rahul!

116
00:08:51.752 --> 00:08:53.960
Arj-Oho!
Rahul!


117
00:08:54.502 --> 00:08:57.085
- How are you?
- How are you?


118
00:08:57.168 --> 00:08:59.085
So good to see you!

119
00:08:59.293 --> 00:09:01.710
What's this new look!

120
00:09:03.085 --> 00:09:04.585
- How was the flight?
- It was alright!


121
00:09:05.252 --> 00:09:07.002
- His bag got left behind.
- Where's your bag?


122
00:09:07.085 --> 00:09:09.252
Actually, the airline lost my bags...

123
00:09:09.418 --> 00:09:11.627
Are you sure it was
the airline and not you?


124
00:09:12.543 --> 00:09:13.585
- How's Dadu?

125
00:09:13.752 --> 00:09:16.668
- Uhh... He's okay...
- He's old now, no...


126
00:09:16.752 --> 00:09:18.293
He'll be under observation
for a couple of days...


127
00:09:18.377 --> 00:09:19.460
Can we meet him now?

128
00:09:19.543 --> 00:09:20.460
- Now?
- Yeah...


129
00:09:20.543 --> 00:09:23.335
Visiting hours are over now...
Go see him in the morning.


130
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.668
I'll stay there tonight.

131
00:09:25.752 --> 00:09:27.668
Oh God, Who did this?!

132
00:09:27.877 --> 00:09:29.293
Who's dirty shoe prints are these?

133
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.418
- Mom... it's...

134
00:09:31.668 --> 00:09:33.002
Geishu! Bad dog!

135
00:09:33.085 --> 00:09:36.293
- Morn, he'll clean it up.
- The house rules are the same!


136
00:09:36.377 --> 00:09:38.418
- Nothing's changed!
- Where's Uncle?


137
00:09:38.627 --> 00:09:40.043
- He's on a cruise...

138
00:09:40.168 --> 00:09:42.877
<i>
- No network 'til they dock.</i>

139
00:09:44.252 --> 00:09:45.293
How's work?

140
00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.585
- I'll make it in two minutes!
- I'm going to shower.


141
00:09:48.752 --> 00:09:50.085
What's wrong?

142
00:09:50.835 --> 00:09:51.918
I made okra...

143
00:09:52.002 --> 00:09:54.418
Such a fussy boy...
I love okra!


144
00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:57.752
- What else did you make?
- Come, see...


145
00:09:58.043 --> 00:10:00.168
Who's going to clean this mess? Arjun!

146
00:10:01.377 --> 00:10:02.543
- Very nice.

147
00:10:03.918 --> 00:10:07.752
So this is a place for
creative people to work in peace?


148
00:10:07.918 --> 00:10:08.918
Yup.

149
00:10:09.002 --> 00:10:11.377
- Nice.
- Artist Retreat...


150
00:10:11.668 --> 00:10:13.460
The investors are almost ready.

151
00:10:13.668 --> 00:10:15.543
How's the novel coming along?

152
00:10:16.043 --> 00:10:17.585
There's some work left...

153
00:10:17.835 --> 00:10:20.335
Actually, I'm lying...
There's a lot of work left.


154
00:10:20.543 --> 00:10:22.793
- God knows how you
manage so much work...


155
00:10:23.127 --> 00:10:25.085
- I owe it all to your okra.
- Drink?


156
00:10:25.168 --> 00:10:26.418
- Yeah...
- Arjun?


157
00:10:26.502 --> 00:10:27.543
- Nah, thanks, Dad...

158
00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.252
Okay, Arjun... Apple pie?

159
00:10:30.252 --> 00:10:31.293
Did you make this?

160
00:10:31.377 --> 00:10:34.502
I did... but it's
Timmy Aunty's recipe...


161
00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:37.585
How's her catering business doing?

162
00:10:37.668 --> 00:10:38.877
- Oh, wonderful...

163
00:10:39.293 --> 00:10:43.502
In fact she thinks I
should open a branch here...


164
00:10:43.627 --> 00:10:44.960
- You should!
- Why not, Ma!


165
00:10:45.043 --> 00:10:46.335
- You should!
- Really?


166
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.543
In fact, all her recipes are superb...

167
00:10:49.002 --> 00:10:50.543
They're not that great...

168
00:10:51.335 --> 00:10:53.335
- Cheers...
- Cheers, Dad...


169
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.918
She earns your annual
income in 3 months...


170
00:10:57.002 --> 00:10:57.877
Here we go...

171
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.085
So it makes no difference
if you think it's great or not...


172
00:11:01.835 --> 00:11:02.710
Morn...

173
00:11:02.877 --> 00:11:04.835
No no, but she's right!

174
00:11:05.252 --> 00:11:06.960
What difference does it make?

175
00:11:07.502 --> 00:11:09.793
- It's really nice...

176
00:11:10.293 --> 00:11:11.418
There's lots more!

177
00:11:13.085 --> 00:11:14.543
" Arjun?"

178
00:11:14.835 --> 00:11:16.877
You've only been on your
phone since you got here.


179
00:11:17.502 --> 00:11:19.252
- Why don't you
talk to us a little...

180
00:11:19.377 --> 00:11:20.835
Or do you have nothing to say?

181
00:11:20.918 --> 00:11:22.543
No, no... Tell me...

182
00:11:23.002 --> 00:11:25.127
How's the website job going?

183
00:11:26.418 --> 00:11:30.502
Ummm... I actually
quit that last month...


184
00:11:31.627 --> 00:11:32.710
- You quit?
- Why?


185
00:11:33.377 --> 00:11:34.752
I mean...

186
00:11:35.085 --> 00:11:36.127
- So now?

187
00:11:36.543 --> 00:11:38.668
Now, I'm concentrating
on my writing...


188
00:11:38.918 --> 00:11:40.710
Finishing my novel...

189
00:11:41.293 --> 00:11:43.543
- Finishing?
- Yeah, almost...


190
00:11:44.627 --> 00:11:45.627
Great...

191
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:46.710
- Good show!

192
00:11:46.918 --> 00:11:49.085
Everyone in this
family's a novelist now.


193
00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:53.543
Shouldn't you have asked before
taking such a big decision?


194
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.335
- We could have discussed it?

195
00:11:55.418 --> 00:11:58.210
Dad... What do you know about my work?
What would I ask?


196
00:11:58.377 --> 00:12:00.960
You're right...
What do I know about anything?


197
00:12:01.127 --> 00:12:02.293
- You could have asked Rahul!

198
00:12:02.377 --> 00:12:03.543
- Dad...
- Dad!


199
00:12:03.627 --> 00:12:04.835
Dad, please don't
interfere with my work...


200
00:12:04.918 --> 00:12:06.210
I'm interfering?

201
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.418
- Harsh...
- Talk properly...


202
00:12:07.502 --> 00:12:09.210
- Harsh!
- What "Harsh, Harsh"?!


203
00:12:09.293 --> 00:12:12.168
- The poor child just got here...
- He quits something every month...


204
00:12:12.252 --> 00:12:13.835
Stop, man, please!

205
00:12:13.918 --> 00:12:14.460
-Arjun...

206
00:12:14.543 --> 00:12:16.543
I'll eat in my room from now,
if all you'll do is pick on me.


207
00:12:16.627 --> 00:12:18.168
Oh, sorry...
I don't have a room anymore, right?


208
00:12:18.418 --> 00:12:20.335
- Arjun!
- Arjun, it's just a few days, man...


209
00:12:20.418 --> 00:12:21.252
Sleep in my room!

210
00:12:21.335 --> 00:12:23.668
You seem to care more about
your room than your career.


211
00:12:23.752 --> 00:12:24.835
Dad!

212
00:12:25.127 --> 00:12:26.502
- Why do you guys do this Ma?
- What could I do?


213
00:12:26.585 --> 00:12:29.127
The doctor's told me
to sleep on a hard mattress...


214
00:12:29.252 --> 00:12:30.835
It's okay, Ma.

215
00:12:39.127 --> 00:12:41.377
I'm going back to the hospital...

216
00:12:41.627 --> 00:12:44.002
- Straight there?
- Yes, straight there.


217
00:12:44.752 --> 00:12:45.835
Ma...

218
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.210
- ls there any green tea?
- Green tea?


219
00:12:49.793 --> 00:12:51.168
Since when do you drink green tea?

220
00:12:51.252 --> 00:12:52.877
I got you this...

221
00:12:54.377 --> 00:12:55.960
That's beautiful!

222
00:12:56.127 --> 00:12:58.460
- You like it?
- Of course!


223
00:12:59.002 --> 00:13:01.627
That's lovely...

224
00:13:02.918 --> 00:13:05.668
- My perfect child.
- That I am...


225
00:13:08.877 --> 00:13:11.377
Can't believe the state of this car.
It looks like a junkyard..


226
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.918
<i>
- By the way.</i>

227
00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.543
Morn said she shifted to your
room to sleep on a different mattress.


228
00:13:16.752 --> 00:13:18.168
But both the rooms
have the same mattress.


229
00:13:18.252 --> 00:13:19.460
What?!

230
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:21.377
The same mattress in both rooms?!

231
00:13:21.585 --> 00:13:22.918
- What now, Sherlock?

232
00:13:23.085 --> 00:13:25.335
Dude... Morn and Dad
are sleeping separately.


233
00:13:25.418 --> 00:13:28.335
You would too if you lived in
the same room as Dad for 35 years.


234
00:13:28.418 --> 00:13:29.668
That's my pen, man!

235
00:13:29.793 --> 00:13:31.793
Leave this damn music
system and watch the road!


236
00:13:31.877 --> 00:13:33.418
If it bothers you so much
maybe you should learn how to drive.


237
00:13:33.502 --> 00:13:35.168
- I know how to drive...
- Yeah, right...


238
00:13:35.335 --> 00:13:37.127
I'm just not comfortable driving.

239
00:13:43.627 --> 00:13:44.377
What is this?!

240
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.752
Toll is 30 rupees,
this is your change.


241
00:13:54.418 --> 00:13:56.043
Oho!!! Stop moving!

242
00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:57.168
It tickles!

243
00:13:57.252 --> 00:13:59.502
How will she tie your gown?!

244
00:13:59.793 --> 00:14:01.127
Get lost, fatty!

245
00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.043
- Dad, what are you doing-
- She just wants to see me naked!


246
00:14:04.627 --> 00:14:05.418
Sorry, sorry...

247
00:14:05.502 --> 00:14:06.752
- Why am I wearing an apron?!

248
00:14:07.085 --> 00:14:10.877
I was an army man for 21 years!

249
00:14:11.002 --> 00:14:13.460
You'll get your pants
back when you're discharged!


250
00:14:13.543 --> 00:14:15.377
Yeah, right... Hey, fatty!

251
00:14:15.502 --> 00:14:16.377
Stop it, Dad...

252
00:14:16.585 --> 00:14:17.668
Dadu!

253
00:14:17.752 --> 00:14:18.502
There they are.

254
00:14:18.585 --> 00:14:20.418
Welcome, kids!

255
00:14:20.752 --> 00:14:23.460
Hey, hey! Don't you dare... Hands up!

256
00:14:23.793 --> 00:14:24.793
- I said, hands up!

257
00:14:24.877 --> 00:14:26.543
- This is a hospital, Dad...
- We're not kids anymore...


258
00:14:26.668 --> 00:14:27.668
Ahhhh!

259
00:14:27.877 --> 00:14:28.710
You also!

260
00:14:30.127 --> 00:14:31.335
Hey, fatty!

261
00:14:32.627 --> 00:14:34.252
- Die fatty die!

262
00:14:34.502 --> 00:14:35.877
Stupid fatty...

263
00:14:40.418 --> 00:14:41.877
Get up, kids...
Your mother's here...


264
00:14:42.002 --> 00:14:44.752
What are you two doing?!
Behaving like 5 year olds...


265
00:14:44.835 --> 00:14:46.168
Hello, Dadu...

266
00:14:46.502 --> 00:14:48.335
Welcome, welcome!

267
00:14:49.918 --> 00:14:51.377
Wow...

268
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:52.668
- Excuse me!

269
00:14:52.752 --> 00:14:55.252
This hospital has a great
psychiatric department...


270
00:14:55.418 --> 00:14:56.627
- Please take him there!

271
00:14:58.293 --> 00:14:59.502
It's not funny, okay!

272
00:14:59.585 --> 00:15:01.168
- Oh, come on...
- Apologize to her!


273
00:15:01.293 --> 00:15:02.460
Sorry, you big fat cow!

274
00:15:02.627 --> 00:15:04.752
Who are you calling a cow?!

275
00:15:05.752 --> 00:15:08.668
- How was the flight?
- It was good, Dadu...


276
00:15:08.752 --> 00:15:11.835
Just latch this here, and prick...

277
00:15:11.918 --> 00:15:14.668
Ow, you idiot!
Are you trying to kill me?!


278
00:15:14.752 --> 00:15:16.668
You can check your
sugar without blood tests!


279
00:15:16.752 --> 00:15:19.085
- What kind of gift is this!
- Well, what do you want?!


280
00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:21.127
Dadu...

281
00:15:22.418 --> 00:15:25.168
What are you laughing at, rascal?
What did you get me?


282
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:28.418
Urn... chocolate?

283
00:15:28.543 --> 00:15:29.877
- Chocolate!
- Arjun!


284
00:15:30.002 --> 00:15:32.043
His sugar has to go up
to use your lovely machine!


285
00:15:32.127 --> 00:15:33.043
Exactly!

286
00:15:33.127 --> 00:15:35.418
Arjun! What's going on?

287
00:15:37.168 --> 00:15:40.085
Make yourself useful...
Go make this payment...


288
00:15:40.168 --> 00:15:41.627
Yes, sir.

289
00:15:43.252 --> 00:15:44.543
Please wait.

290
00:15:49.168 --> 00:15:50.627
Hey, Wasim!

291
00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.877
Arjun!

292
00:15:55.502 --> 00:15:56.585
How are you, man?!

293
00:15:56.668 --> 00:15:57.918
When did you get here?
Should have called!


294
00:15:58.002 --> 00:16:00.043
I landed yesterday, man...

295
00:16:00.127 --> 00:16:01.043
What are you doing here?

296
00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:02.377
Dadu had a heart attack...

297
00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.877
Dadu... He's alive?!

298
00:16:04.043 --> 00:16:06.502
- Ass! I'll hit you!
- How's he doing?


299
00:16:06.752 --> 00:16:08.918
He's okay now... What are
you doing here? All okay?


300
00:16:09.043 --> 00:16:11.502
Ummm... hemorrhoids...

301
00:16:12.502 --> 00:16:13.377
What?!

302
00:16:13.835 --> 00:16:15.543
Hemorrhoids, man!

303
00:16:17.377 --> 00:16:18.335
Don't laugh, jerk!

304
00:16:18.418 --> 00:16:20.585
You ran away to the US and I'm
stuck here doing photography!


305
00:16:20.668 --> 00:16:23.418
Rotting all day in dad's studio...
Smile and click, smile and click!


306
00:16:23.502 --> 00:16:24.752
You're chilling in life, man!

307
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.585
Really?! Come to the studio
and see the stunners of Coonoor!


308
00:16:27.668 --> 00:16:28.918
Of course! Let's catch up soon!

309
00:16:29.002 --> 00:16:30.335
Come tonight!

310
00:16:30.418 --> 00:16:32.085
- Tonight...
- Remember Malik's bungalow?


311
00:16:32.168 --> 00:16:33.210
Malik...

312
00:16:34.502 --> 00:16:36.293
That's where the party is! Come!

313
00:16:36.418 --> 00:16:37.918
I can't, man... 
Family scene...

314
00:16:38.002 --> 00:16:40.085
How can you ditch a party, bro...

315
00:16:40.543 --> 00:16:43.168
Bro, isn't that your brother? Boobly?

316
00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:44.252
- What's he doing?!

317
00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.668
- Don't ask, man... He's training for some
Mr. Ooty bodybuilding competition...


318
00:16:47.752 --> 00:16:49.668
- Whose child is this?
- Hi, Boobly!


319
00:16:50.752 --> 00:16:53.752
Why don't you check out some
properties for your retreat here?


320
00:16:53.918 --> 00:16:56.460
- Why not?
- I'll talk to the broker.


321
00:16:56.585 --> 00:16:58.502
I said, switch off your phone!

322
00:16:59.543 --> 00:17:00.752
Yes... and put some adhesive there...

323
00:17:00.835 --> 00:17:02.835
- What's happening?
- And what about this leak here?


324
00:17:03.043 --> 00:17:06.168
He'll take care of it!
He's a professional, we're paying him!


325
00:17:06.377 --> 00:17:07.252
He'll handle it.

326
00:17:07.335 --> 00:17:09.627
- The bucket's full...
- I am aware.


327
00:17:10.335 --> 00:17:11.460
Take lessons... 
She knows everything.

328
00:17:11.543 --> 00:17:13.210
- Geishu! Put him down!

329
00:17:13.293 --> 00:17:14.918
Not on the sofa.. Put him down!

330
00:17:15.002 --> 00:17:17.752
Arjun! the doctor's calling...
Empty this bucket...


331
00:17:17.877 --> 00:17:19.918
Dad! I have to
take Geishu for a walk...

332
00:17:20.002 --> 00:17:22.752
One second...
Arjun, don't be a useless fellow!


333
00:17:22.918 --> 00:17:24.085
Morn told me to!

334
00:17:24.418 --> 00:17:25.835
Dad, I'm coming... Let it be.

335
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.460
Come, Geishu!

336
00:17:29.543 --> 00:17:30.918
Tomorrow? Okay...

337
00:17:37.043 --> 00:17:38.168
Dad, I don't get it...

338
00:17:38.252 --> 00:17:40.502
If the doctors recommend
treating Dadu in Bangalore...


339
00:17:40.585 --> 00:17:41.377
What's the problem?

340
00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.252
It's not so simple...

341
00:17:43.335 --> 00:17:46.627
It cost <i>7</i> lakh rupees
to put the stents in... 7!


342
00:17:46.752 --> 00:17:48.543
What happened to the advance
you were supposed to get?


343
00:17:48.668 --> 00:17:51.502
It's still bloody stuck!
It'll come... Just taking time...


344
00:17:51.627 --> 00:17:53.418
But don't worry... 
I'll talk to Shashi...

345
00:17:53.502 --> 00:17:55.293
How can you keep asking
your younger brother for money?!


346
00:17:55.377 --> 00:17:56.502
Have some shame!

347
00:17:56.585 --> 00:17:59.043
What's shameful about it!
We're both his sons!


348
00:17:59.127 --> 00:18:00.627
Yes, except he takes
care of all the expenses!


349
00:18:00.752 --> 00:18:02.668
And where does Dad stay?
He doesn't take care of that!


350
00:18:02.752 --> 00:18:04.335
- You'll are unbelievable,
you'll fight over anything!


351
00:18:04.418 --> 00:18:08.210
All Shashi's college expenses
were handled by me! Harsh Kapoor!


352
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.127
- Morn, dad, please!

353
00:18:10.293 --> 00:18:13.085
No need!
We won't take money from Shashi.


354
00:18:13.252 --> 00:18:15.335
- Where will the money come from?
- Break my fixed deposit.


355
00:18:15.418 --> 00:18:18.085
Sir! Can you please help?

356
00:18:19.252 --> 00:18:20.752
- I'm coming...
- Ma please don't break your FD.


357
00:18:20.835 --> 00:18:21.752
- Just hold this, please.

358
00:18:21.835 --> 00:18:23.668
What a mess you've made!
What the hell are you doing?


359
00:18:23.752 --> 00:18:25.543
- I can help with the money...
- No no no!


360
00:18:25.627 --> 00:18:27.335
You've been talking about
your investment forever...


361
00:18:27.418 --> 00:18:29.168
- It's alright...
- Rahul! Get a cloth!


362
00:18:29.252 --> 00:18:30.835
Yes! Getting it...

363
00:18:35.502 --> 00:18:36.668
Why can't we break my deposit?

364
00:18:36.752 --> 00:18:38.752
I had to pay the loan installment!
Where would I get that?


365
00:18:38.835 --> 00:18:40.210
From your imaginary
catering business?!


366
00:18:40.293 --> 00:18:41.835
- That was my money!
- Yeah, right...


367
00:18:41.918 --> 00:18:43.710
I've been saving for
my business for 3 years!


368
00:18:43.793 --> 00:18:44.793
What were you saving?!

369
00:18:44.877 --> 00:18:46.960
The money I give you
to run the house, right?


370
00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:47.502
So?

371
00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:48.668
- How is that your money?
- Dad, stop it!


372
00:18:48.752 --> 00:18:49.460
Leave me!

373
00:18:49.543 --> 00:18:50.960
- Where did you spend it?
- Morn...


374
00:18:51.043 --> 00:18:53.043
- Your business is in the dumps.
- Stop behaving like children...


375
00:18:53.127 --> 00:18:55.418
- Did you give it to Anu?
- Stop your nonsense!


376
00:18:55.502 --> 00:18:57.752
Hold this. I said, hold this!

377
00:18:58.168 --> 00:18:59.293
Are you insane?

378
00:18:59.377 --> 00:19:01.585
You sit here and concoct
these wild fantasies in your head!


379
00:19:01.668 --> 00:19:02.585
Dad!

380
00:19:02.752 --> 00:19:04.127
Sir...

381
00:19:04.293 --> 00:19:05.335
Should I come later?

382
00:19:05.418 --> 00:19:07.752
- Oh, so Anu just happened
to get a new car?


383
00:19:07.877 --> 00:19:10.460
Smriti told me!
Where did Anu get that much money?


384
00:19:10.543 --> 00:19:12.627
- How would I know?!
- lt just fell into her lap?!


385
00:19:12.752 --> 00:19:15.043
Maybe it did!
Do I look like her accountant?


386
00:19:15.168 --> 00:19:17.960
- Get up now! Enough! Get out!
- Dad...


387
00:19:18.127 --> 00:19:20.002
Not a chance!
Sit down and finish your work!


388
00:19:20.085 --> 00:19:21.752
- I said get up!
- ' Stop it!


389
00:19:21.835 --> 00:19:23.960
Fix this leak!
And switch off your damn phone!


390
00:19:24.043 --> 00:19:25.752
What's happening?
Everyone's at it without me today?


391
00:19:25.835 --> 00:19:27.210
This isn't the time for jokes.

392
00:19:27.543 --> 00:19:30.960
Dad, Morn... I've told you
I have some money... I can invest later!


393
00:19:31.043 --> 00:19:32.960
- Who needs money?
- Just stay out of it...


394
00:19:33.127 --> 00:19:34.293
I'm talking to Morn!

395
00:19:34.377 --> 00:19:36.668
Your father has blown up all my money!

396
00:19:36.835 --> 00:19:38.085
Now we have to beg your uncle.

397
00:19:38.168 --> 00:19:39.585
Enough, Sunita! 
That's enough!

398
00:19:39.668 --> 00:19:41.335
- How much money do you need?
- You keep quiet.


399
00:19:41.418 --> 00:19:43.377
Arjun... I've told you already!

400
00:19:43.502 --> 00:19:46.585
We're discussing actual money and
not a packet of M&M'S... Stay out of it!


401
00:19:46.668 --> 00:19:47.835
It's not like I live off you!

402
00:19:47.918 --> 00:19:50.418
Just shut up! All of you!
I'm tired of you'll!


403
00:19:50.502 --> 00:19:51.710
I was better off at Timmy's!

404
00:19:51.793 --> 00:19:53.002
That's a lovely idea, Sunita...

405
00:19:53.085 --> 00:19:56.168
Last time you went for <i>2</i> months...
Go for 6 months now!


406
00:19:56.252 --> 00:19:58.085
Dad, stop shouting...
Tell me what the problem is!


407
00:19:58.168 --> 00:20:00.793
Arjun, do me a favor.
Handle your own problems!


408
00:20:00.877 --> 00:20:03.460
- Why are you always taunting me?!
- I'm not taunting you!


409
00:20:03.543 --> 00:20:04.752
- I'm done, sir!

410
00:20:05.335 --> 00:20:07.168
- Done? How much?

411
00:20:07.293 --> 00:20:09.752
Anything you can spare
in these tough times...


412
00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:12.877
- I'll slap this idiot...
- Dad, enough now!


413
00:20:13.043 --> 00:20:15.210
- Switch off your phone!
- It's your phone, Dad!


414
00:20:15.293 --> 00:20:17.252
I know it's my phone, I'm not deaf!

415
00:20:17.335 --> 00:20:18.502
Everyone thinks I'm
an idiot around here...


416
00:20:18.585 --> 00:20:20.127
You're not an idiot, 
I'm the idiot...

417
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:21.710
No one's told me what's
happening since I got here!


418
00:20:21.793 --> 00:20:23.543
I'm always treated like an outsider!
Rahul, stop touching me!


419
00:20:23.627 --> 00:20:24.502
- Stay away!
- Arjun...


420
00:20:24.585 --> 00:20:26.252
I'm always the last to
find out what's happening here...


421
00:20:26.335 --> 00:20:28.293
You called Rahul to tell him
about Dadu... Not me! Why?!


422
00:20:28.377 --> 00:20:29.752
Because you always react like a child!

423
00:20:29.835 --> 00:20:31.793
- Shut up, Rahul!
- You shut up!


424
00:20:32.085 --> 00:20:32.918
Talk softly!

425
00:20:33.002 --> 00:20:35.793
Use your millions from
your "blog" to help out!


426
00:20:36.835 --> 00:20:38.752
You think you're a big shot
because you wrote some book?!


427
00:20:38.877 --> 00:20:40.418
Arjun! Stop!
Stop it!


428
00:20:40.502 --> 00:20:42.585
Only you and I know
the truth about you!


429
00:20:42.668 --> 00:20:44.877
- I'll break his goddamn face!
- You've gone mad!


430
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.460
Enough, mom! It's always me...

431
00:20:49.293 --> 00:20:51.210
- What are you doing?!
- What do you mean what am I doing?!


432
00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:54.418
All you'll want to
do is create a scene!


433
00:20:54.543 --> 00:20:56.335
Arjun... Arjun, listen, please...

434
00:20:56.418 --> 00:20:57.627
Arjun, listen to me!

435
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:59.002
Morn, even you know he's a thief!

436
00:20:59.085 --> 00:21:01.377
You'll are both here
together after 5 years...


437
00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.377
Must you behave like bloody animals?!

438
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.252
Everything's always my fault, Ma!
Rahul is totally innocent!


439
00:21:06.418 --> 00:21:08.877
And everything was
just a co-incidence?


440
00:21:10.627 --> 00:21:11.793
Arjun, listen...

441
00:21:25.668 --> 00:21:30.085
- Hi this is Wasim! Sorry,
can't talk now... Leave a message!


442
00:21:50.835 --> 00:21:52.252
- Guys! Guys! Come on!

443
00:21:52.418 --> 00:21:54.460
- Someone bet on Sahil!

444
00:21:54.543 --> 00:21:55.835
- You Will?

445
00:21:55.918 --> 00:21:58.627
- What kind of friends
do you have, man?!


446
00:21:58.752 --> 00:22:00.668
Someone put money on me, guys...
I've known you'll for years!


447
00:22:00.752 --> 00:22:03.460
- Come on, guys!
- Come on, guys...


448
00:22:05.335 --> 00:22:09.418
One second, one second! Guys!
I believe in Sahil! Put money on him!


449
00:22:09.585 --> 00:22:12.168
He has core strength!

450
00:22:14.043 --> 00:22:18.335
Aww man! Kishore!
Kishore the fuse is out again!


451
00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.877
Fix it!!!

452
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.627
- We love you, Kishore!
- Ya, we love you very much!


453
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.918
Now, listen. I'm betting on Sahil.
Twenty bucks!


454
00:22:26.085 --> 00:22:28.502
Twenty bucks!!! Good job, T!

455
00:22:28.585 --> 00:22:31.127
I'm putting 20 bucks...
Excuse me, it's a lot of money!


456
00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.502
And he'll put money!
Come on!


457
00:22:33.627 --> 00:22:35.168
Come on, man!

458
00:22:35.377 --> 00:22:36.877
What the hell? Okay, you?

459
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.043
Okay, excuse me.
You! He'll put money!


460
00:22:39.127 --> 00:22:41.085
He looks skinny,
but he has core strength!


461
00:22:41.168 --> 00:22:42.668
These guns have a lot of power!

462
00:22:42.793 --> 00:22:45.043
- Come on, come on!
- Alright... ya!


463
00:22:45.252 --> 00:22:46.377
Sahil! Ya? Ya!

464
00:22:49.627 --> 00:22:51.752
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil!

465
00:23:04.252 --> 00:23:06.127
Bunkoo, dude..
Your whole drink is on me!


466
00:23:06.335 --> 00:23:08.085
Shit...

467
00:23:09.377 --> 00:23:10.752
Bunkooo...

468
00:23:16.335 --> 00:23:18.418
Umm... sorry. I was just going out...

469
00:23:18.585 --> 00:23:22.127
I should be the one apologizing...
I lost your money!


470
00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:23.793
No, that's okay...

471
00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.293
Actually, I knew
Sahil has no core strength...


472
00:23:28.127 --> 00:23:29.793
Are you Sahil's friend?

473
00:23:30.835 --> 00:23:33.252
Umm... No... I'm Wasim's friend...

474
00:23:33.627 --> 00:23:34.793
Wasim?

475
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.043
He knows the owners of this place.

476
00:23:39.127 --> 00:23:41.877
I'm the owner... 
I don't know Wasim.

477
00:23:42.168 --> 00:23:43.377
Oh! Umm...

478
00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.168
I was just trying to call Wasim,
but I couldn't get through...


479
00:23:46.252 --> 00:23:47.168
One second.

480
00:23:47.293 --> 00:23:51.543
You're sitting here rolling this...
Gatecrashing my party...


481
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:54.085
Wasim must be here...
I couldn't find him...


482
00:23:54.168 --> 00:23:56.043
- Seriously?

483
00:23:56.127 --> 00:23:57.335
Couldn't get through to him?

484
00:23:57.418 --> 00:24:00.085
Kishore! Kishore!
Kishore throw this guy out!


485
00:24:00.252 --> 00:24:01.877
Okay, I'll leave! I'm sorry!

486
00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.043
- Can I take that?
- No no no, this is going to stay here...


487
00:24:04.127 --> 00:24:07.502
I'm sorry, I was just having
a really bad day, so I thought...


488
00:24:07.585 --> 00:24:10.418
I'm sorry, what? Seriously? Leave!

489
00:24:10.502 --> 00:24:12.002
- I'm sorry, I know you're upset...
- Leave!


490
00:24:12.085 --> 00:24:14.252
Ya, okay I'm leaving...

491
00:24:20.752 --> 00:24:22.210
What's so funny?

492
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:26.085
I'm so sorry!

493
00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:29.668
Shit... I was just kidding!
I'm sorry!


494
00:24:30.252 --> 00:24:32.335
It's supposed to be funny! I'm sorry!

495
00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.043
<i>'</i> Okay...
<i>'</i> Ya!


496
00:24:34.668 --> 00:24:36.710
- Listen, you're cool, right?
- Good one...


497
00:24:36.835 --> 00:24:37.543
Ya!

498
00:24:38.835 --> 00:24:41.085
- Do you have a lighter?
- Yeah, of course...


499
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:44.668
- I'm Arjun.

500
00:24:44.835 --> 00:24:46.127
Tia... Tia!

501
00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:47.627
- Hi...
- Hi!


502
00:24:54.835 --> 00:24:56.835
Why are you so troubled, Arjun?

503
00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:01.127
Don't ask...
I'm having such a rubbish day...


504
00:25:01.502 --> 00:25:03.085
Fought with your girlfriend?

505
00:25:04.293 --> 00:25:05.210
Then?

506
00:25:06.793 --> 00:25:08.252
With my brother.

507
00:25:08.543 --> 00:25:09.752
Your butler?

508
00:25:09.918 --> 00:25:11.043
Not butler, brother!

509
00:25:12.043 --> 00:25:13.960
Why would I fight with a butler?

510
00:25:14.293 --> 00:25:15.502
Actually... yeah!

511
00:25:15.668 --> 00:25:17.918
And even if I did,
why would I sit here like this?!


512
00:25:18.085 --> 00:25:19.960
Point taken...

513
00:25:20.752 --> 00:25:23.710
This bungalow's been empty
for years... never seen you around...


514
00:25:23.793 --> 00:25:26.377
The tea state and this bungalow
belong to my grandfather...


515
00:25:26.502 --> 00:25:29.127
I've lived in Bombay since I was 5...
because of Dad's work.


516
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:30.543
So, planning to shift here?

517
00:25:30.627 --> 00:25:32.127
No! Planning to rent it out!

518
00:25:32.502 --> 00:25:34.877
But my best friend Bunkoo's
boyfriend is from Ooty...


519
00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.543
So I had to have one last party!

520
00:25:38.752 --> 00:25:40.127
O... kay?!

521
00:25:40.252 --> 00:25:41.752
- Wasim!
- One second...


522
00:25:42.127 --> 00:25:43.627
Bro? Are you okay?

523
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:44.502
Wasim!

524
00:25:44.585 --> 00:25:46.252
Ya... Him! See? 
I was calling him?

525
00:25:46.418 --> 00:25:47.918
- Are you okay?
- Ya...


526
00:25:48.002 --> 00:25:49.085
- You okay, bro?
- Ya...


527
00:25:49.168 --> 00:25:50.502
False alarm.

528
00:25:50.668 --> 00:25:53.210
- Wasim! Tia. Tia! Wasim.
- Hi Wasim!


529
00:25:53.335 --> 00:25:54.918
She's the owner of this place.

530
00:25:55.043 --> 00:25:56.460
What are you'll doing in the bathroom?

531
00:25:56.543 --> 00:25:58.168
- We were about to take a shower.
- What?!


532
00:25:59.252 --> 00:26:00.668
- Come on...
- Ya, one minute...


533
00:26:00.752 --> 00:26:01.877
- You okay, Wasim?
- I'm fine now.


534
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.543
Tia! Come on,
let's get this party started!


535
00:26:04.627 --> 00:26:07.752
Okay! You're good?
Arjun, Wasim... let's go! Time to party!


536
00:28:49.918 --> 00:28:52.293
Guys! ls there an Arjun here?

537
00:28:52.502 --> 00:28:53.710
Ummm... me!

538
00:28:54.293 --> 00:28:55.793
Don't puke in the car, man!
Get out!


539
00:28:55.877 --> 00:28:57.168
I'll leave you here on the road!

540
00:28:57.377 --> 00:28:59.168
- What are you doing to me!

541
00:28:59.377 --> 00:29:02.543
- Man, couldn't you have
waited two minutes to throw up...


542
00:29:03.085 --> 00:29:04.793
- My day was finally
picking up at that party...


543
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:13.543
The property agent's coming at 11.30.

544
00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:15.835
He'll show you some places...

545
00:29:16.377 --> 00:29:20.335
Then go see Dadu and tell
him we're taking him to Bangalore.


546
00:29:20.793 --> 00:29:22.835
I'll figure out the money with Shashi.

547
00:29:23.918 --> 00:29:26.252
- You want tea?
- No, thanks... I'm fine.


548
00:29:28.168 --> 00:29:29.377
- Dad...
- Ya?


549
00:29:31.127 --> 00:29:33.752
Why did Morn stay with
Timmy Aunty for <i>2</i> months?


550
00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.960
- She came back, right?
- That's not what I asked, Dad...


551
00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.043
To belittle me, what else...

552
00:29:39.127 --> 00:29:42.043
Timmy started her catering
business after her divorce...


553
00:29:42.127 --> 00:29:44.168
Morn thinks she can do it too.

554
00:29:44.752 --> 00:29:48.085
How can she compare me
to that bloody wife-beater?!


555
00:29:49.585 --> 00:29:52.043
Do I drink like Timmy's ex?

556
00:29:52.627 --> 00:29:54.710
Have I ever hit her?
Abused her?


557
00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:57.043
Dad... Why do you always do this?

558
00:29:57.127 --> 00:29:58.585
You never listen to anyone.

559
00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:00.793
Morn only needs your
support... Nothing else.


560
00:30:00.877 --> 00:30:03.043
Really?
And what about me?


561
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:06.168
Where was everyone
when I needed support?


562
00:30:07.168 --> 00:30:09.377
Everything was fine
'til I worked at the bank.


563
00:30:09.543 --> 00:30:12.460
I started this business
for you'll... For you. For her!


564
00:30:12.668 --> 00:30:13.752
What's wrong with that?

565
00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:17.752
There is a financial crisis.
What can I possibly do?


566
00:30:18.002 --> 00:30:19.377
Kill myself?

567
00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.293
Dad, please...

568
00:30:23.585 --> 00:30:24.918
I'm tired...

569
00:30:25.918 --> 00:30:29.168
I know... and you're a good man.

570
00:30:29.418 --> 00:30:31.335
Everything will be okay, I promise.

571
00:30:31.668 --> 00:30:33.085
Just one day at a time, okay?

572
00:30:35.168 --> 00:30:36.293
One day at a time...

573
00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:37.877
Thanks, buddy.

574
00:30:43.918 --> 00:30:46.210
Sir, all of Coonoor's
best properties are with us.


575
00:30:46.293 --> 00:30:47.293
- Really?
- So don't worry...


576
00:30:47.377 --> 00:30:50.710
Yes, Mr. Makhija, somehow the
properties today didn't reflect that.


577
00:30:50.835 --> 00:30:52.085
You didn't like anything today, right?

578
00:30:52.168 --> 00:30:54.043
I'll have a fresh batch
ready for you tomorrow...


579
00:30:54.127 --> 00:30:57.002
Yes, please...
A quiet place for creative people...


580
00:30:57.168 --> 00:30:59.710
- Not abandoned, haunted houses.
- Thank you.


581
00:31:01.668 --> 00:31:02.418
Yeah, Nik!

582
00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:11.460
Woah!

583
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:13.585
- Rahul...
- Arjun?!


584
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.835
Dadu was getting bored, man...

585
00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.168
Ohh, just take him
to a disco then, bro.


586
00:31:18.585 --> 00:31:19.877
Disco?

587
00:31:20.168 --> 00:31:22.293
The nurse is asking for
the reports... Go get them.


588
00:31:22.377 --> 00:31:23.918
Fine.

589
00:31:24.293 --> 00:31:26.168
- Dadu, I'm coming...
- This is a hospital!


590
00:31:26.252 --> 00:31:27.918
I want to go to a disco!

591
00:31:28.127 --> 00:31:29.335
- Tell me something...

592
00:31:30.543 --> 00:31:32.418
Why are you like this?

593
00:31:32.502 --> 00:31:33.543
Like what?

594
00:31:33.627 --> 00:31:35.252
Grumpy...

595
00:31:35.335 --> 00:31:40.043
Don't do this, don't do that,
not like this, not like that...


596
00:31:40.293 --> 00:31:43.335
Relax, son... Relax...

597
00:31:44.418 --> 00:31:45.877
Okay, I'm sorry...

598
00:31:46.793 --> 00:31:48.668
But trust me, whatever we do,
we do for you...


599
00:31:48.752 --> 00:31:50.377
That's true...

600
00:31:50.877 --> 00:31:54.168
And that's why, we're
taking you to Bangalore for treatment...


601
00:31:54.377 --> 00:31:57.710
I don't want to go anywhere!
I'm not going!


602
00:31:58.002 --> 00:32:00.960
Next week is my birthday!

603
00:32:01.377 --> 00:32:05.168
I want to celebrate
my birthday with my family.


604
00:32:05.252 --> 00:32:07.335
Happy Birthday, Dadu,
but your treatment is very important.


605
00:32:07.418 --> 00:32:10.418
- I don't want any treatment!

606
00:32:10.502 --> 00:32:13.627
I don't aspire to live much longer.

607
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:16.127
When I go, I'll go like this -

608
00:32:22.668 --> 00:32:24.210
- I'm right, son...

609
00:32:25.002 --> 00:32:27.252
- But if you do want
to do something for me...


610
00:32:27.418 --> 00:32:29.252
Then I have two wishes.

611
00:32:29.418 --> 00:32:30.543
Which are?

612
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:35.668
The first is that,
when I die, don't light my pyre.


613
00:32:37.127 --> 00:32:38.335
So, what, you'll just lie there?

614
00:32:38.418 --> 00:32:39.585
No, duffer!

615
00:32:39.918 --> 00:32:41.085
Bury me!

616
00:32:41.543 --> 00:32:44.252
- With my friends from
my army regiment...


617
00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.252
In the army burial ground!

618
00:32:46.418 --> 00:32:48.168
Wow. And what's the other wish?

619
00:32:48.252 --> 00:32:56.252
The other one is, before I go,
I want a happy family photograph...


620
00:32:57.002 --> 00:32:59.752
- Which I can put on my wall...

621
00:33:00.127 --> 00:33:07.043
It should read -
'Kapoor and Sons, since 1921'.


622
00:33:07.543 --> 00:33:11.293
Very nice... The creative juices
are really flowing today, huh?


623
00:33:11.377 --> 00:33:14.335
Well, when Uncle gets here,
we can fulfill this wish.


624
00:33:14.418 --> 00:33:15.502
Okay!

625
00:33:19.835 --> 00:33:20.877
Listen, man...

626
00:33:21.793 --> 00:33:24.877
We're here only for a few days...
Let's not fight...


627
00:33:27.293 --> 00:33:29.418
I'm sorry for last night.

628
00:33:39.335 --> 00:33:40.877
- Here you go... Your toll...

629
00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.252
- What?

630
00:33:44.252 --> 00:33:46.127
And this is for the hospital... Sorry.

631
00:34:03.293 --> 00:34:04.377
So you're showing me
some places tomorrow, right?


632
00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:05.668
- Rahul!
- I hope it's a nice place...


633
00:34:06.585 --> 00:34:07.377
Bye!

634
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:10.127
- Yeah?
- Mom's calling you in.


635
00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:11.377
Okay... Thanks.

636
00:34:13.543 --> 00:34:14.752
- Listen!
- Yeah?


637
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.002
She wants a couple of cigarettes...

638
00:34:17.543 --> 00:34:19.168
Ha ha, very funny...

639
00:34:19.335 --> 00:34:20.460
Want to share?

640
00:34:22.627 --> 00:34:23.793
Thanks.

641
00:34:26.918 --> 00:34:28.627
What did the doctors say?

642
00:34:29.793 --> 00:34:32.418
- What difference does it make?
- Ask me what Dadu said.


643
00:34:32.502 --> 00:34:33.418
What?

644
00:34:33.627 --> 00:34:35.460
He wants to get discharged
and celebrate his birthday at home...


645
00:34:35.543 --> 00:34:36.710
Really?!

646
00:34:37.002 --> 00:34:38.752
It's his 90th birthday, man...

647
00:34:39.502 --> 00:34:40.627
Let's do something!

648
00:34:41.293 --> 00:34:43.502
Actually, I was thinking
of the same thing...


649
00:34:43.835 --> 00:34:48.668
Like a surprise 90th birthday party?
It'll be nice...


650
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.418
With the beautiful
grannies of Coonoor?


651
00:34:52.252 --> 00:34:54.460
No, with Russian strippers
and caviar.


652
00:34:54.543 --> 00:34:55.585
Stupid...

653
00:34:55.752 --> 00:34:58.918
Dunno about caviar, but Russian
strippers will make Dadu's day.


654
00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:02.418
Remember when Morn found
Dadu's porn stash?


655
00:35:02.918 --> 00:35:05.252
Yeah, behind the pot!

656
00:35:05.585 --> 00:35:07.460
Tied up in a plastic bag...

657
00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.252
He's a crazy dude...

658
00:35:09.377 --> 00:35:11.210
One of those magazines were mine, man...

659
00:35:11.377 --> 00:35:12.002
No.

660
00:35:12.085 --> 00:35:12.960
Barely Legal.

661
00:35:13.043 --> 00:35:14.502
- Barely Legal?!
- Ya.


662
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:15.918
Oh God...

663
00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.085
It was depressing!
My only magazine!


664
00:35:18.168 --> 00:35:19.877
But I managed...

665
00:35:20.835 --> 00:35:21.835
Ah...

666
00:35:22.002 --> 00:35:23.377
Still managing, huh?

667
00:35:23.502 --> 00:35:26.543
Doing really well,
actually... Practice makes perfect...


668
00:35:27.627 --> 00:35:29.668
Wait 'til I tell
Morn about your antics...


669
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.127
Look here!

670
00:35:32.127 --> 00:35:33.210
Thanks...

671
00:35:33.668 --> 00:35:34.627
'Barely Perfect'...

672
00:35:34.752 --> 00:35:36.627
- Wait 'til I tell Morn.
- What are you doing, man?


673
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:38.502
- Nothing, just Photoshop.
- Delete it!


674
00:35:38.585 --> 00:35:40.377
- I'm only putting it on Instagram!
- Arjun, I was just joking!


675
00:35:40.418 --> 00:35:41.752
Watch it, I'll tweet it...

676
00:35:42.252 --> 00:35:43.210
Arjun, just leave it!

677
00:35:45.043 --> 00:35:46.127
Ninety years...

678
00:35:46.293 --> 00:35:49.335
Ninety... and is this
all Burma Teak wood?


679
00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.585
Yeah.

680
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:52.918
- Hi.
- Hi!


681
00:35:55.377 --> 00:35:57.585
Listen... can I click some pictures?

682
00:35:57.752 --> 00:35:59.668
- Of course.
- Thank you.


683
00:36:00.043 --> 00:36:03.168
Wow, who's that!
I think I'm rushing into this marriage!


684
00:36:03.627 --> 00:36:05.168
So cute, dude!

685
00:36:05.543 --> 00:36:07.002
Hit on him!

686
00:36:09.418 --> 00:36:12.085
- May I have a look inside?
- Sure!


687
00:36:13.085 --> 00:36:14.377
Have you lost it?

688
00:36:14.418 --> 00:36:16.043
- He's so cute, man, I can't help it!
- Tia!


689
00:36:16.127 --> 00:36:17.168
Come with us, Tia...

690
00:36:17.252 --> 00:36:20.252
No, no... You guys go!
It's your pre-Honeymoon period...


691
00:36:20.377 --> 00:36:22.043
What'll I do there?

692
00:36:22.377 --> 00:36:25.502
Okay, but we've decided we're
coming back for your birthday.


693
00:36:25.585 --> 00:36:27.252
Not this birthday thing again.

694
00:36:27.377 --> 00:36:29.293
I honestly want to
spend alone time here.


695
00:36:29.418 --> 00:36:31.835
Plus, I have work - a presentation
to finish and... now I have to go in.


696
00:36:32.002 --> 00:36:33.668
- Yes, sir! Corning.
- Okay, go...


697
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.085
- You have a really nice house, Tia!
- Thank you.


698
00:36:36.377 --> 00:36:38.752
So I'll share the pictures
with my partners and...


699
00:36:38.918 --> 00:36:42.710
Meanwhile, if there's a family elder
I can talk to about business and such...


700
00:36:42.877 --> 00:36:44.127
Please give me the number?

701
00:36:44.877 --> 00:36:46.252
Umm... me.

702
00:36:47.877 --> 00:36:49.877
- Oh, sorry.
- No, that's fine.


703
00:36:50.252 --> 00:36:53.043
When I think of owners,
they're usually old men.


704
00:36:53.127 --> 00:36:55.377
Stomach out, no hair, etc...

705
00:36:55.793 --> 00:37:00.127
Of course! But I look pretty much
the same without my wig and dentures.


706
00:37:02.418 --> 00:37:04.210
How did you find the place, son?

707
00:37:06.627 --> 00:37:08.502
- You're funny.
- You're hot.


708
00:37:12.418 --> 00:37:15.668
I'm really funny!
Sometimes. Funny girl...


709
00:37:15.793 --> 00:37:17.085
Yeah, it was a pleasure.

710
00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:18.752
- Keep in touch.
- You too.


711
00:37:18.918 --> 00:37:20.418
- Okay, bye...
- Bye!


712
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:27.085
And this was taken in Hawaii.

713
00:37:28.252 --> 00:37:29.543
You know, son...

714
00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:35.293
I used to dream of going to Hawaii...
And roaming naked on the beach...


715
00:37:35.627 --> 00:37:38.543
One chica here and one...

716
00:37:39.377 --> 00:37:42.835
That dream should have
been fulfilled in your youth.


717
00:37:43.002 --> 00:37:48.085
Ignore her. Maybe we should
take you to France for your birthday.


718
00:37:48.168 --> 00:37:49.335
France has the nude beaches.

719
00:37:49.418 --> 00:37:53.210
Take me anywhere...
All I have to do is shave my chest.


720
00:37:53.585 --> 00:37:57.210
I mean, if you want to get
six pack abs, that'll be good too...


721
00:37:57.377 --> 00:37:58.752
Leave this.

722
00:37:59.043 --> 00:38:02.377
Tell me... Can you watch
anything you want on this... iPanda?


723
00:38:02.543 --> 00:38:03.543
Yeah...

724
00:38:03.877 --> 00:38:05.627
- Films, too?
- Yes...


725
00:38:06.793 --> 00:38:08.377
Like... exciting films?

726
00:38:09.585 --> 00:38:11.002
Exciting?

727
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:14.918
What do they call it... blue films?!

728
00:38:16.793 --> 00:38:17.627
You can...

729
00:38:18.543 --> 00:38:20.752
- How exciting!
- There are cartoon versions now!


730
00:38:20.835 --> 00:38:22.293
- Ohhh!
- Yeah!


731
00:38:22.418 --> 00:38:24.585
It's so easy for your generation.

732
00:38:24.752 --> 00:38:25.752
How so?

733
00:38:25.918 --> 00:38:31.585
I lied to your Grandma and watched
Ram Teri Ganga Maili 14 times!


734
00:38:31.752 --> 00:38:32.543
14!

735
00:38:32.627 --> 00:38:34.002
Just for one scene...

736
00:38:34.127 --> 00:38:37.085
When Mandakini comes in that wet sari...

737
00:38:37.918 --> 00:38:40.710
After that waterfall...

738
00:38:41.168 --> 00:38:43.710
I would dream of standing behind her...

739
00:38:43.793 --> 00:38:46.085
She would embrace me-

740
00:38:46.627 --> 00:38:50.668
I think the bananas are rotten, buddy...

741
00:38:53.252 --> 00:38:55.418
That's what they
call a change of topic!


742
00:38:55.835 --> 00:38:57.293
My arms call out to you...

743
00:38:57.418 --> 00:38:59.418
- I have a lot to learn from you.
- Check this out!


744
00:38:59.627 --> 00:39:00.793
Oi!!!

745
00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:03.418
It's her!

746
00:39:06.043 --> 00:39:09.460
Stop me before I
climb into this iPanda!


747
00:39:13.127 --> 00:39:16.460
Arjun... I have an idea.

748
00:39:18.252 --> 00:39:22.002
Are you sure Dadu won't like a
foxy 10x10 photo of your Grandma more?


749
00:39:22.168 --> 00:39:23.835
You know Dadu...

750
00:39:24.335 --> 00:39:26.418
No, dude... your Grandma was quite sexy.

751
00:39:27.043 --> 00:39:29.460
- Not my Grandmom!
- This could break!


752
00:39:29.877 --> 00:39:31.252
Come here for a second!

753
00:39:31.335 --> 00:39:32.418
Bring this inside!

754
00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:34.085
What man...

755
00:39:34.168 --> 00:39:35.377
Look it's ready... Karim!

756
00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:39.335
- Stop staring at Aunty
and bring her in!


757
00:39:48.585 --> 00:39:50.543
- Uncle! White and red small-
- Boo!


758
00:39:50.627 --> 00:39:52.960
Oh my God! Arjun! Hi!

759
00:39:53.418 --> 00:39:54.627
- How are you?
- Good!


760
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:55.543
Not available.

761
00:39:55.627 --> 00:39:57.835
- Where can I get it?
- No idea, ma'am.


762
00:39:57.918 --> 00:39:58.793
What are you looking for?

763
00:39:58.877 --> 00:40:01.710
You know... We used to eat
those sweet cigarettes as kids?


764
00:40:01.877 --> 00:40:02.502
Oh ya ya...

765
00:40:02.585 --> 00:40:04.627
I can't find them
anywhere and I love them!


766
00:40:04.835 --> 00:40:05.877
- Ah!
- Yeah...


767
00:40:06.752 --> 00:40:07.752
What are you doing here?

768
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.127
I was actually in Wasim's studio...

769
00:40:11.293 --> 00:40:12.418
Want to see?

770
00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:13.835
Okay... what?

771
00:40:13.918 --> 00:40:14.960
- Come I'll show... come!
- Okay!


772
00:40:15.043 --> 00:40:16.960
- Aye! Okay, please pack this!
- Come!


773
00:40:27.085 --> 00:40:28.877
Don't judge,
it's for Dadu's birthday!


774
00:40:29.043 --> 00:40:31.627
Boobly! I know this bodybuilding
competition is important...


775
00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:32.627
I'll get people!

776
00:40:34.418 --> 00:40:35.335
<i>~</i> Hi!
<i>~</i> Hi!


777
00:40:35.418 --> 00:40:36.210
What's up?

778
00:40:36.293 --> 00:40:37.918
Tia... I'm good! How are you?

779
00:40:38.085 --> 00:40:39.752
Stop enjoying this
and take madam inside.


780
00:40:39.877 --> 00:40:41.043
Don't touch her there...

781
00:40:41.127 --> 00:40:43.043
Boobly's called you
for the bodybuilding thing.


782
00:40:43.168 --> 00:40:44.252
Come man, please... it'll be fun.

783
00:40:44.335 --> 00:40:45.460
I have no interest in naked men.

784
00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:49.418
Try and understand, man... Boobly
doesn't have my brains or looks!


785
00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:50.918
- He only knows bodybuilding!
- Let it go, man...


786
00:40:51.002 --> 00:40:52.627
He needs the encouragement...
It'll be fun!


787
00:40:52.835 --> 00:40:53.793
I'll come!

788
00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:55.168
You? Really?

789
00:40:55.252 --> 00:40:56.002
Ya!

790
00:40:56.085 --> 00:40:57.543
- That's nice.
- I'm nice.


791
00:40:57.627 --> 00:40:59.043
Ya... she's nice.

792
00:40:59.293 --> 00:41:02.418
Okay, I guess I'll come too...
Day after, right?


793
00:41:02.627 --> 00:41:04.210
Look at this turncoat.

794
00:41:04.418 --> 00:41:06.210
Team player, bro!
Boobly's like my brother!


795
00:41:06.293 --> 00:41:07.668
Oh, is that right?!

796
00:41:09.043 --> 00:41:10.960
- Day after?
- Day after.


797
00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:28.418
Listen, this is the catering area.
We need 10 tables set up there.


798
00:41:28.502 --> 00:41:29.293
(OKAY.)

799
00:41:29.377 --> 00:41:31.252
- Mehfooz! Up there!
- DJ?


800
00:41:31.335 --> 00:41:32.835
The DJ's ready.
Ready, ready...


801
00:41:32.918 --> 00:41:34.252
- I'm going now.
- Confetti!


802
00:41:34.335 --> 00:41:35.293
Morn!

803
00:41:35.377 --> 00:41:37.752
- Where's the phone diary kept?
- It's right there! Here!


804
00:41:37.835 --> 00:41:38.668
Oh, okay.

805
00:41:39.918 --> 00:41:42.793
I finally spoke to Shashi Uncle... He
said he'll be here as soon as he can.


806
00:41:42.877 --> 00:41:43.668
Okay, thank goodness.

807
00:41:43.752 --> 00:41:46.710
And also why don't you
call some of your hot friends.


808
00:41:48.168 --> 00:41:50.627
Oh and listen...
Don't tell Shashi Uncle anything.


809
00:41:50.793 --> 00:41:51.627
About what?

810
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:53.752
All that drama with your Dad...

811
00:41:53.835 --> 00:41:57.293
Hello? This is Rahul calling on behalf
of Mr. Ramesh Chand...


812
00:41:57.377 --> 00:41:58.668
May I speak to Mr. Chaudhry?

813
00:41:59.627 --> 00:42:00.835
What?!

814
00:42:02.877 --> 00:42:04.085
I'm sorry to hear that.

815
00:42:04.585 --> 00:42:05.502
- Bro...

816
00:42:05.918 --> 00:42:08.252
Looks like at this rate only you,
me and Wasim will be at this party.


817
00:42:08.918 --> 00:42:10.710
Ask Dad to call his friends!

818
00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.543
Ask your Dad to call his friends!

819
00:42:14.002 --> 00:42:15.168
What's cooking?

820
00:42:15.377 --> 00:42:17.502
Smells really nice!

821
00:42:21.835 --> 00:42:24.960
Morn, I never talk to Shashi
Uncle about such things.


822
00:42:25.627 --> 00:42:29.043
I'm not choosing sides
or saying who's right...


823
00:42:29.377 --> 00:42:31.752
But lately, you're always
picking fights with Dad.


824
00:42:32.418 --> 00:42:33.502
I'm picking fights?!

825
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:36.460
I'm just telling it as I see it.

826
00:42:36.877 --> 00:42:39.877
You know what my 35th
anniversary gift was?


827
00:42:41.168 --> 00:42:42.252
A Mixer
-Grinder...

828
00:42:42.752 --> 00:42:43.918
- From Harsh.

829
00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.585
There's no difference between
Dharmendra and me, these days.


830
00:42:47.752 --> 00:42:49.877
- What?!
- It's not like I can be Anu!


831
00:42:50.252 --> 00:42:53.710
Ever since she opened her boutique,
all I hear is -


832
00:42:54.043 --> 00:42:56.752
"Anu's taste", "Anu's business sense"...

833
00:42:56.835 --> 00:42:59.752
Morn, not this Anu spiel again...
Who cares about Anu's taste?!


834
00:42:59.835 --> 00:43:01.835
Can't we all talk about
this like mature adults?!


835
00:43:04.043 --> 00:43:05.502
Maybe not all of us...

836
00:43:06.835 --> 00:43:09.752
Morn, come to London
with me for a few days?


837
00:43:09.877 --> 00:43:10.752
With you?

838
00:43:11.168 --> 00:43:12.335
What would I do there?

839
00:43:12.418 --> 00:43:13.585
We'll party, obviously!

840
00:43:14.918 --> 00:43:17.835
No, no... You're always so busy...

841
00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.460
Morn I've lived there for 8 years...

842
00:43:19.543 --> 00:43:22.543
If you don't come,
how will you see how I live...


843
00:43:22.752 --> 00:43:25.752
. where I live... and more importantly
with whom I live?


844
00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.418
Ah! Point!

845
00:43:27.627 --> 00:43:33.668
But you forget... as your mother,
I know you better than anyone else.


846
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:37.960
Okay, if you want
to do something for me...


847
00:43:38.293 --> 00:43:43.627
Forget this Nicky person
and get me a nice Indian bride.


848
00:43:44.002 --> 00:43:46.960
- Grandchildren playing on my lap...
- End of conversation!


849
00:43:47.127 --> 00:43:49.793
Look who it is!

850
00:43:50.252 --> 00:43:52.460
I'm ready to have
Rahul's perfect children!


851
00:43:53.043 --> 00:43:54.752
Idiots.

852
00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.293
Oh, Rahul... She's perfect!

853
00:43:57.502 --> 00:44:00.127
Look what you've done, Rahul!

854
00:44:01.418 --> 00:44:02.335
Bye!

855
00:44:04.418 --> 00:44:06.002
- I'm here 'til the 12th!

856
00:44:07.418 --> 00:44:10.752
I've called for the documents... They
should be here in a couple of days.


857
00:44:11.918 --> 00:44:14.210
Here we are at the main porch.

858
00:44:15.168 --> 00:44:17.418
Say hello to our helpful broker,
Mr. Makhija.


859
00:44:18.043 --> 00:44:21.418
It's not African, it's an Indian name!

860
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:26.252
And this, Nick, is the beautiful
owner of this house... Tia.


861
00:44:26.335 --> 00:44:27.377
Say hi.

862
00:44:27.418 --> 00:44:29.668
Hi! Who am I talking to?

863
00:44:29.752 --> 00:44:30.668
Be nice.

864
00:44:31.335 --> 00:44:35.252
I'm heading to the garden
to show you the wonderful sunset.


865
00:44:35.502 --> 00:44:37.585
I really can't believe
this place was shut for <i>2</i> years.


866
00:44:38.293 --> 00:44:40.293
If I was you,
I'd come once every <i>2</i> months.


867
00:44:40.377 --> 00:44:42.043
It's only a 2 hour flight from Mumbai!

868
00:44:42.252 --> 00:44:45.335
Yeah... but I'm scared of flying.

869
00:44:45.793 --> 00:44:49.377
So? Everyone's afraid of something...

870
00:44:49.668 --> 00:44:51.085
What are you afraid of?

871
00:44:51.293 --> 00:44:52.418
I'm not telling you.

872
00:44:52.668 --> 00:44:54.960
Why?! Come on...

873
00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:57.293
- It's embarrassing.
- Come on, Rahul...


874
00:44:57.418 --> 00:44:58.585
- Rats...
- What?!


875
00:44:58.668 --> 00:44:59.460
Rats!

876
00:44:59.543 --> 00:45:00.543
Are you serious?!

877
00:45:00.627 --> 00:45:01.460
I'm serious!

878
00:45:02.377 --> 00:45:03.627
Very manly!

879
00:45:04.043 --> 00:45:06.710
There's a Nepalese
film playing at Liberty...


880
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.668
Sorry, Kishore,
I don't know Nepalese...


881
00:45:09.752 --> 00:45:11.543
Tia he isn't asking you out...
I think he's asking for himself.


882
00:45:11.627 --> 00:45:15.835
I know! My sense of humor...
Please go!


883
00:45:16.002 --> 00:45:18.335
- Your dinner?
- I'll eat out.


884
00:45:18.668 --> 00:45:20.252
Bye, Kishore...

885
00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:21.543
I love you, Kishore!

886
00:45:21.627 --> 00:45:24.377
- Does he always look so scared?
- Always!


887
00:45:25.002 --> 00:45:27.668
Are there any good
restaurants around here?


888
00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:32.002
Maybe Shinchow's?!

889
00:45:41.502 --> 00:45:42.793
Kishore always looks depressed!

890
00:45:42.877 --> 00:45:44.835
He's actually really happy!

891
00:45:45.127 --> 00:45:46.210
By <i>the way..</i>

892
00:45:46.418 --> 00:45:48.418
You're right!
This place is shady as hell!


893
00:45:48.502 --> 00:45:49.793
Warned you...

894
00:45:51.043 --> 00:45:52.168
So spicy!

895
00:45:53.918 --> 00:45:55.585
Something's stuck in your teeth...

896
00:45:57.168 --> 00:45:58.210
Sorry...

897
00:45:58.418 --> 00:45:59.793
More beer?

898
00:46:00.168 --> 00:46:01.793
2 more beers, please!

899
00:46:02.585 --> 00:46:03.627
Oh!

900
00:46:04.418 --> 00:46:06.752
There's something
coming out of your nose...


901
00:46:07.127 --> 00:46:08.043
Sorry...

902
00:46:10.835 --> 00:46:12.002
Now?

903
00:46:16.002 --> 00:46:17.377
<i>l</i> got you!

904
00:46:17.835 --> 00:46:20.460
Okay... what's more embarrassing...

905
00:46:20.752 --> 00:46:24.127
Chicken stuck in your teeth
or a booger coming out of your nose?


906
00:46:24.418 --> 00:46:25.960
A booger stuck in my teeth!

907
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:27.043
What?!

908
00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:28.377
Can that even happen?!

909
00:46:28.418 --> 00:46:29.877
Didn't you do this as a kid?

910
00:46:30.835 --> 00:46:32.335
Yuck! Rahul!

911
00:46:32.418 --> 00:46:34.543
- I used to love it, man!

912
00:46:34.793 --> 00:46:35.877
That's sick!

913
00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:36.835
Thank you!

914
00:46:42.418 --> 00:46:43.960
No way Tia...
There's a limit to being crazy...


915
00:46:44.043 --> 00:46:44.877
There is no such limit!

916
00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:46.543
There is! You can't do it, anyway...

917
00:46:46.627 --> 00:46:49.543
If I do this,
we are going to the dance floor.


918
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:51.377
- Done.
- Okay.


919
00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:07.502
Shit! Sorry!

920
00:47:08.793 --> 00:47:09.835
Sir!

921
00:47:10.252 --> 00:47:13.377
It was a mosquito! 
You'll get dengue!

922
00:47:13.502 --> 00:47:14.918
What mosquito?

923
00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:17.418
I also got bitten...

924
00:47:17.835 --> 00:47:19.043
Sir!

925
00:47:30.043 --> 00:47:31.002
Show me your moves!

926
00:47:31.252 --> 00:47:32.293
What moves?

927
00:47:33.002 --> 00:47:34.377
Everyone's got moves!

928
00:47:34.543 --> 00:47:35.418
Such as?

929
00:47:35.793 --> 00:47:37.002
Such as...

930
00:47:37.168 --> 00:47:39.168
The Shampoo Ad move!

931
00:47:39.252 --> 00:47:40.168
(OKAY.)

932
00:47:42.918 --> 00:47:44.210
Come on!

933
00:47:49.002 --> 00:47:49.918
Your turn.

934
00:47:50.002 --> 00:47:52.293
Okay... The Milkshake!

935
00:47:53.793 --> 00:47:54.585
Okay...

936
00:47:57.918 --> 00:48:00.293
Oh God! Superb!

937
00:48:00.668 --> 00:48:01.918
This is my favorite!

938
00:48:02.293 --> 00:48:03.960
Grinding spices move!

939
00:48:04.043 --> 00:48:05.335
Alright! Okay.

940
00:48:06.502 --> 00:48:08.752
Grinding spices!

941
00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.210
The Iron move!

942
00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:18.085
Pigeon!

943
00:48:23.168 --> 00:48:24.502
Electrocution!

944
00:48:33.877 --> 00:48:35.168
Okay... bye...

945
00:48:35.377 --> 00:48:36.293
Bye...

946
00:48:36.585 --> 00:48:37.877
See you.

947
00:48:38.418 --> 00:48:39.835
- Let's go.
- Oh shit...


948
00:48:39.918 --> 00:48:40.752
What's wrong?

949
00:48:40.835 --> 00:48:43.793
- Kishore!
- The fuse is out again!


950
00:48:44.168 --> 00:48:47.293
Tell me if there are any more issues
with this house... I'll call Makhija.


951
00:48:47.377 --> 00:48:49.293
- Rat!!!
- What the f-


952
00:48:54.918 --> 00:48:57.085
Are you nuts?!

953
00:48:59.252 --> 00:49:00.710
This might work...

954
00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:07.377
Or not.

955
00:49:08.835 --> 00:49:10.377
It's a little small, isn't it?

956
00:49:14.627 --> 00:49:15.752
What?

957
00:49:17.668 --> 00:49:19.043
What is it?

958
00:49:20.293 --> 00:49:22.168
- Dude...
- Tia, you're sick.


959
00:49:24.377 --> 00:49:25.335
What are you saying?

960
00:49:25.418 --> 00:49:28.418
You're leaving?! 
My fuse... oh.

961
00:49:29.293 --> 00:49:32.377
Sorry!
It was a joke!


962
00:49:32.877 --> 00:49:35.002
Kishore, man!!!

963
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.168
Bang it right in the center...

964
00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:43.543
You hold this.

965
00:49:44.127 --> 00:49:45.835
I'll lift you up.

966
00:49:46.085 --> 00:49:47.460
Are you sure?

967
00:49:48.418 --> 00:49:50.418
Okay, one second... One second!

968
00:49:50.627 --> 00:49:51.793
Okay, ready.

969
00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:54.252
Okay, ready.

970
00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.835
You're really heavy, man!

971
00:49:57.918 --> 00:49:59.918
- Shut up! I have heavy bones!

972
00:50:00.002 --> 00:50:01.168
- Oh God!

973
00:50:01.585 --> 00:50:02.668
- Oh God!

974
00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:06.002
Sorry...

975
00:50:06.502 --> 00:50:08.877
Let me see?

976
00:50:09.418 --> 00:50:11.210
I think it's a scratch or-

977
00:50:12.877 --> 00:50:14.793
A little bit here...

978
00:50:16.043 --> 00:50:17.293
Right there...

979
00:50:17.543 --> 00:50:18.668
ls it hurting?

980
00:50:22.835 --> 00:50:24.127
- Ma'am?!

981
00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:25.752
Kishore!

982
00:50:26.418 --> 00:50:27.293
Where are you?

983
00:50:27.377 --> 00:50:29.002
Kishore, where were you?!

984
00:50:29.085 --> 00:50:31.377
I was watching the movie!

985
00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:33.085
Why didn't you fix this?

986
00:50:33.252 --> 00:50:36.418
That's for the pump room!
The fuse is here.


987
00:50:37.377 --> 00:50:40.127
Why is it there? 
You didn't fix it...

988
00:50:41.335 --> 00:50:42.710
Thank God...

989
00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:48.710
I'll leave... It's late.

990
00:50:48.835 --> 00:50:49.627
-Yeah...

991
00:50:50.127 --> 00:50:52.168
<i>'</i> Okay...
<i>'</i> Okay!


992
00:50:52.752 --> 00:50:54.002
- Bye...
- Bye.


993
00:51:00.043 --> 00:51:01.168
Bunkoo...

994
00:51:02.668 --> 00:51:04.002
I’m so-

995
00:51:04.418 --> 00:51:06.418
Please go, Kishore. Thank you.

996
00:51:07.793 --> 00:51:10.543
Shit, Bunkoo... 
Shit shit shit...

997
00:51:10.752 --> 00:51:12.293
I'm so stupid!

998
00:51:12.418 --> 00:51:14.543
Shit, I'm so stupid!

999
00:51:16.585 --> 00:51:18.418
This is all your fault!

1000
00:51:19.585 --> 00:51:20.752
Hey...

1001
00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:23.377
you think he won't
want my house now?


1002
00:51:23.627 --> 00:51:26.460
- Listen, let's discuss
this over Skype on Thursday...


1003
00:51:26.918 --> 00:51:29.460
I can't right now!
I've got too much on my plate!


1004
00:51:29.585 --> 00:51:31.585
I'm at the hospital,
I'll call you later.


1005
00:51:32.293 --> 00:51:33.127
Bye.

1006
00:51:33.502 --> 00:51:35.002
What's wrong? Problem?

1007
00:51:36.335 --> 00:51:38.335
I'm never gonna finish this damn book!

1008
00:51:40.752 --> 00:51:42.085
Harsh isn't here?

1009
00:51:42.793 --> 00:51:43.668
No, Why?

1010
00:51:44.668 --> 00:51:46.835
He said he'd come with you...

1011
00:51:48.668 --> 00:51:49.960
Now he's using you as an excuse.

1012
00:51:50.043 --> 00:51:50.918
Morn!

1013
00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:53.835
Don't be so suspicious all the time...

1014
00:51:54.543 --> 00:51:56.127
I'm going to Dadu.

1015
00:51:57.418 --> 00:51:58.668
Woah...

1016
00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.793
How can they be so huge?!

1017
00:52:03.043 --> 00:52:05.210
You have no idea how
big they can be, Dadu!


1018
00:52:05.418 --> 00:52:08.043
I love this so much...

1019
00:52:08.335 --> 00:52:09.918
It stopped!

1020
00:52:10.168 --> 00:52:12.418
You need a credit card to watch more...

1021
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:13.793
Give me yours!

1022
00:52:13.877 --> 00:52:15.418
Mine... actually...

1023
00:52:16.085 --> 00:52:19.377
Rahul! You have a credit card, right?

1024
00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:20.627
Ya, Why?

1025
00:52:20.918 --> 00:52:25.377
I... I... want to download
some hymns!


1026
00:52:25.918 --> 00:52:27.752
- Yeah, Wasim!
- Turning to religion, Dadu?


1027
00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:30.668
Ever since my heart attack
it's the only thing that keeps happy.


1028
00:52:30.752 --> 00:52:32.210
<i>'</i> Really?
<i>'</i> Yes!


1029
00:52:32.585 --> 00:52:34.252
Dadu, I'm off.

1030
00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:35.335
What's your hurry?

1031
00:52:35.418 --> 00:52:39.002
I'm going to see Boobly's big ones...
It's free... Wanna come?


1032
00:52:39.085 --> 00:52:40.585
No, no, I have my hymns.

1033
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:42.502
- Okay, bye...
- Bye!


1034
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:44.793
Oi! spiritual card.

1035
00:52:49.585 --> 00:52:51.460
He's so sexy.

1036
00:52:52.668 --> 00:52:55.418
Boobly! This girl thinks you're sexy!

1037
00:52:55.752 --> 00:52:57.085
Thanks for coming.

1038
00:53:00.168 --> 00:53:01.127
Very welcome.

1039
00:53:07.168 --> 00:53:08.585
This is mad!

1040
00:53:09.752 --> 00:53:12.418
How can I be enjoying this?!
What's wrong with me!


1041
00:53:14.543 --> 00:53:18.252
Look at Mr. Red Briefs...
Such a long nose!


1042
00:53:18.335 --> 00:53:20.585
I can't believe THAT'S
what you noticed!


1043
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:21.627
I mean...

1044
00:53:22.418 --> 00:53:23.752
You know what they say...

1045
00:53:23.835 --> 00:53:25.585
A long nose means a long...

1046
00:53:25.668 --> 00:53:26.668
Ah...

1047
00:53:29.418 --> 00:53:31.502
Your nose is pretty tiny.

1048
00:53:34.502 --> 00:53:36.793
It's Boobly!

1049
00:53:42.293 --> 00:53:43.668
Oh my God!

1050
00:53:55.085 --> 00:53:57.085
This was my favorite pose!

1051
00:53:57.335 --> 00:54:02.085
Oh, wow... butt in, chest out!
Wow! Too hot!


1052
00:54:02.918 --> 00:54:06.543
One second... God, why is
my brother always calling me!


1053
00:54:07.668 --> 00:54:08.585
Hello?

1054
00:54:08.668 --> 00:54:09.710
Yeah...

1055
00:54:10.543 --> 00:54:13.127
Yes, I'll take morn tomorrow morning...

1056
00:54:13.585 --> 00:54:15.793
Ya, don't worry... 
I'll be there.

1057
00:54:16.502 --> 00:54:19.293
See you in a bit. 
I'll call you... bye.

1058
00:54:21.585 --> 00:54:23.543
So Beavis and Butthead patched up!

1059
00:54:24.043 --> 00:54:26.960
Yeah... Beavis and Butthead
patched up for now.


1060
00:54:27.668 --> 00:54:30.502
- Have you got siblings?
- Nope. One and only!


1061
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:33.168
Wow! You're so lucky...

1062
00:54:33.502 --> 00:54:35.293
You must've been such a pampered kid.

1063
00:54:35.418 --> 00:54:38.043
I mean, my sweetiepie, my princess...

1064
00:54:38.252 --> 00:54:39.585
That never happened to me.

1065
00:54:41.168 --> 00:54:44.043
You want to be called
'princess' and 'sweetiepie'?


1066
00:54:44.127 --> 00:54:47.543
No, man... I didn't get
much attention growing up...


1067
00:54:48.502 --> 00:54:51.918
My parents died when I was 13.
So I know what you mean.


1068
00:54:52.002 --> 00:54:54.293
Oh... I'm sorry... 
I didn't mean-

1069
00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:56.460
No, it's okay!
It's not like you knew...


1070
00:54:57.293 --> 00:54:58.502
It's okay.

1071
00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:02.585
I have an offer for you.

1072
00:55:02.877 --> 00:55:04.752
Take my family and
give me your bungalow?


1073
00:55:04.877 --> 00:55:07.627
Oh, really! I'll think about it...

1074
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:10.252
- Princess!
- Oh ya, of course!


1075
00:55:15.168 --> 00:55:16.627
- Here you go.

1076
00:55:16.835 --> 00:55:19.127
- Some music?
- Ya! Nice pictures...


1077
00:55:19.293 --> 00:55:20.418
Thank you...

1078
00:55:23.752 --> 00:55:25.502
- Listen I don't mean
to be inappropriate...


1079
00:55:25.585 --> 00:55:27.043
- but isn't this too big for you?

1080
00:55:27.127 --> 00:55:29.335
- Arjun!
- What is this, 48 G?!


1081
00:55:29.418 --> 00:55:31.710
Pervert! It's Bunkoo's!

1082
00:55:31.793 --> 00:55:34.502
- Let's meet Bunkoo again, man.
- You're sick! You know that, right?


1083
00:55:34.752 --> 00:55:36.168
- Sick!
- Jealous?


1084
00:55:36.668 --> 00:55:40.168
Of course... that's why
I sent her far, far away.


1085
00:55:40.752 --> 00:55:43.627
Man... someone sedate my brother.

1086
00:55:44.252 --> 00:55:47.627
- Why do you fight with him so much?
- Why do you ask so many questions?


1087
00:55:47.668 --> 00:55:49.460
That's how you make friends!

1088
00:55:51.168 --> 00:55:53.043
- And you don't give up, huh?
- No!


1089
00:55:53.377 --> 00:55:54.710
I don't give up.

1090
00:55:55.835 --> 00:55:57.710
Come on, you can tell me.

1091
00:56:03.793 --> 00:56:08.293
So... 5 years ago,
I was writing my first novel.


1092
00:56:08.752 --> 00:56:13.252
My brother's first book had failed...
and he was struggling with his second.


1093
00:56:15.252 --> 00:56:18.502
When his second book was published,
a year later...


1094
00:56:18.877 --> 00:56:22.210
lt was a bestseller... did really well...

1095
00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:31.418
The only problem was that...
his idea was exactly like mine...


1096
00:56:34.002 --> 00:56:34.960
No...

1097
00:56:35.043 --> 00:56:37.668
Of course the writing style
was different... different ending...


1098
00:56:37.752 --> 00:56:42.252
But... subplots,
characters... very similar.


1099
00:56:45.377 --> 00:56:47.043
Didn't you ever confront him about it?

1100
00:56:48.252 --> 00:56:51.918
No... everyone would have said
I'm jealous of his success, as always.


1101
00:56:52.168 --> 00:56:57.002
Besides... Morn said this
could destroy our family... so...


1102
00:56:58.668 --> 00:56:59.793
Maybe...

1103
00:57:02.877 --> 00:57:06.502
Just think... if my name
had been on that book...


1104
00:57:07.793 --> 00:57:10.168
today publishers
would be chasing me...


1105
00:57:10.252 --> 00:57:13.710
And my parents wouldn't
think I'm such a big loser.


1106
00:57:18.668 --> 00:57:23.627
I have something to cheer you up.

1107
00:57:24.585 --> 00:57:26.793
First close your eyes... come on.

1108
00:57:28.127 --> 00:57:31.585
- What are your intentions?
- Just wait.


1109
00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.252
Hold on...

1110
00:57:36.835 --> 00:57:38.377
Okay...

1111
00:57:40.377 --> 00:57:42.752
Actually you're right...
I do feel better!


1112
00:57:43.127 --> 00:57:45.293
- See!
- Thanks! I'll take it home.


1113
00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:46.835
Give it back!

1114
00:57:47.168 --> 00:57:48.918
It's not your size.

1115
00:57:49.793 --> 00:57:51.752
Free tomorrow evening?

1116
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:53.918
Why?

1117
00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.918
Arjun Kapoor's suitcase.

1118
00:58:00.002 --> 00:58:01.418
The lock's broken!

1119
00:58:01.668 --> 00:58:03.710
Morn! Where's Arjun?

1120
00:58:03.877 --> 00:58:05.877
- He went to pick up Wasim!

1121
00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:12.168
You can talk to the airline
if there's a problem...


1122
00:58:12.877 --> 00:58:14.460
- Hello...

1123
00:58:14.585 --> 00:58:16.210
Nice to see you...

1124
00:58:16.418 --> 00:58:18.460
- Welcome!
- We are the first ones!


1125
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:21.085
- Smile!
- Cheese!


1126
00:58:23.293 --> 00:58:26.585
- Thank you!
- Thank you, uncle... take care!


1127
00:58:26.835 --> 00:58:28.627
- Who's an uncle?!
- Thank you...


1128
00:58:28.793 --> 00:58:30.918
Who taught you all this?!
The wardboy?


1129
00:58:31.002 --> 00:58:34.668
No one! I invented the selfie myself!

1130
00:58:34.877 --> 00:58:35.918
You and your stories...

1131
00:58:36.002 --> 00:58:37.543
What stories?!

1132
00:58:43.877 --> 00:58:45.460
Wow, she's hot!

1133
00:58:45.585 --> 00:58:47.752
She was my flatmate last year.

1134
00:58:48.377 --> 00:58:50.168
- You live with a chick?
- Ya!


1135
00:58:50.377 --> 00:58:52.252
I live with Boobly.

1136
00:58:52.543 --> 00:58:54.918
Can I borrow Rahul for a minute?

1137
00:58:55.043 --> 00:58:56.877
- Come with me...
- Excuse me.


1138
00:58:57.335 --> 00:58:59.168
- There's someone I want you to meet...
- Who?


1139
00:58:59.252 --> 00:59:00.293
Just come!

1140
00:59:00.377 --> 00:59:01.460
- Morn.

1141
00:59:02.293 --> 00:59:03.710
- I'll hang myself if...
- Preet!


1142
00:59:03.793 --> 00:59:06.918
Hi! I want you
to meet my son, Rahul.

1143
00:59:07.002 --> 00:59:07.793
Hi...

1144
00:59:07.877 --> 00:59:10.793
Preet's family owns
the King's Craig estate now.


1145
00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.252
<i>'</i> Really!
<i>'</i> Yes!


1146
00:59:12.335 --> 00:59:13.460
Hi, Preet... I'm Rahul.

1147
00:59:13.543 --> 00:59:15.210
Look at those kids!
Excuse me.


1148
00:59:15.752 --> 00:59:17.210
What the hell are you doing?!

1149
00:59:18.377 --> 00:59:19.960
I like your shoes!

1150
00:59:20.418 --> 00:59:22.210
Orange is my favorite colour!

1151
00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:23.585
ls it?!

1152
00:59:24.085 --> 00:59:26.085
- They're actually tangerine.
- Oh.


1153
00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.043
Nice...

1154
00:59:29.002 --> 00:59:31.168
So... what do you do?

1155
00:59:31.252 --> 00:59:33.585
I work for a tea company.

1156
00:59:33.835 --> 00:59:34.585
Boobly!

1157
00:59:34.668 --> 00:59:36.335
- Hi, what's up?
- How are you?


1158
00:59:36.502 --> 00:59:37.793
Thanks for coming.

1159
00:59:40.335 --> 00:59:41.168
You're welcome!

1160
00:59:41.252 --> 00:59:42.335
- Hey!

1161
00:59:42.835 --> 00:59:44.002
Hi, Arjun!

1162
00:59:45.002 --> 00:59:46.043
Hey, hi!

1163
00:59:46.127 --> 00:59:48.168
" What's up?"

1164
00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:50.710
We have organic green teas...

1165
00:59:50.793 --> 00:59:55.210
black teas, white teas,
silver tips... and Oolong!


1166
00:59:55.293 --> 00:59:56.710
Have you tried it?

1167
00:59:57.002 --> 00:59:59.210
No, I'm an alcoholic...
so just alcohol for me.


1168
00:59:59.335 --> 01:00:00.252
I'm just kidding.

1169
01:00:00.335 --> 01:00:02.460
I'll go get myself a beer. Want one?

1170
01:00:02.543 --> 01:00:03.252
No...

1171
01:00:03.335 --> 01:00:04.335
- Be right back.
- Okay!


1172
01:00:04.418 --> 01:00:05.918
Wow! Thank you!

1173
01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:07.752
- Did you do all of this?
- Yes!


1174
01:00:08.002 --> 01:00:10.960
If not a writer,
then at least a balloon man.


1175
01:00:11.085 --> 01:00:12.502
- Shut up!
- Save me, man.


1176
01:00:12.585 --> 01:00:14.418
Mom's stuck me with some tea lady!

1177
01:00:14.502 --> 01:00:15.960
Woah, let me see!

1178
01:00:16.668 --> 01:00:17.460
Hi!

1179
01:00:17.543 --> 01:00:18.627
Hi...

1180
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:19.793
What are you doing here?

1181
01:00:19.877 --> 01:00:21.460
I'm here for his Dadu's birthday!

1182
01:00:21.543 --> 01:00:22.668
How do you know her?

1183
01:00:22.793 --> 01:00:24.543
We're friends... Wait.

1184
01:00:24.793 --> 01:00:26.335
How do you know each other?

1185
01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:30.085
I'm thinking of leasing her house
for the Artist Retreat.


1186
01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:31.210
My house!

1187
01:00:31.502 --> 01:00:32.252
Oh!

1188
01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:34.293
(OKAY.)

1189
01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:36.127
I didn't know you'll were friends!

1190
01:00:36.335 --> 01:00:37.960
He's my older brother.

1191
01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:39.252
Butthead?!

1192
01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:40.918
- Rahul!

1193
01:00:41.543 --> 01:00:44.418
- Same thing.
- Yeah... no... never mind.


1194
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:47.085
- Small world!
- Yeah, small world, after all...


1195
01:00:47.627 --> 01:00:48.627
Really...

1196
01:00:50.668 --> 01:00:52.627
- Will you have something?
- Of course!


1197
01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.168
I don't mind a drink...

1198
01:00:54.252 --> 01:00:55.585
- Beer?
- Ya... sure.


1199
01:00:55.668 --> 01:00:58.085
- What about you?
- No... thanks.


1200
01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:05.835
Listen, I'm really
sorry about the other day...


1201
01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:08.002
- It's okay...
- I'm really embarrassed.


1202
01:01:08.168 --> 01:01:09.335
Apology balloons?

1203
01:01:09.418 --> 01:01:11.627
Yes! For you! Please!

1204
01:01:11.752 --> 01:01:14.002
Thanks... It's okay,
I was pretty drunk, too.


1205
01:01:14.168 --> 01:01:17.585
Yeah! I think they put
something in those memos.


1206
01:01:17.668 --> 01:01:18.543
Food?

1207
01:01:18.627 --> 01:01:20.293
Nah, my stomach's off...

1208
01:01:22.543 --> 01:01:24.085
Something's burning...

1209
01:01:24.377 --> 01:01:25.877
Careful, Dharmendra!

1210
01:01:26.835 --> 01:01:28.210
It's your butt, buddy!

1211
01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:30.002
Hemorrhoids!

1212
01:01:30.377 --> 01:01:31.585
Dadu's here...

1213
01:01:32.585 --> 01:01:33.835
Uncle, Dadu's here.

1214
01:01:34.043 --> 01:01:35.252
Guys, Dadu's here.

1215
01:01:35.335 --> 01:01:38.043
- ls the gift ready?
- Yeah, I'll get it.


1216
01:01:38.835 --> 01:01:40.585
Guys! Dadu's here... come!

1217
01:01:40.668 --> 01:01:41.960
Wasim!

1218
01:04:05.002 --> 01:04:07.127
Hurry up, old man...

1219
01:04:08.668 --> 01:04:11.377
Dadu, this is my friend... Tia.

1220
01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:13.502
- Happy birthday, Dadu!
- Thank you...


1221
01:04:13.585 --> 01:04:16.627
I have a confession.. You're so cute,
I can't take my eyes off you.


1222
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:18.335
Really...

1223
01:04:18.668 --> 01:04:20.377
She's hitting on me...

1224
01:04:21.293 --> 01:04:22.960
Girls today, I tell you...

1225
01:04:23.043 --> 01:04:25.418
Will you go on a
date to Hawaii with me?


1226
01:04:25.502 --> 01:04:26.710
Hawaii?! Of course!

1227
01:04:26.877 --> 01:04:28.918
Come on, play your turn!

1228
01:04:29.002 --> 01:04:31.627
Alright, fine...

1229
01:04:32.377 --> 01:04:33.543
Look!

1230
01:04:34.752 --> 01:04:37.460
Wow, Dadu! Great hand!

1231
01:04:38.377 --> 01:04:39.752
Sorry, we pack.

1232
01:04:40.335 --> 01:04:41.377
Pack!

1233
01:04:42.835 --> 01:04:43.918
Damn it!

1234
01:04:44.002 --> 01:04:45.293
I'm so sorry!

1235
01:04:45.418 --> 01:04:46.877
So then, I win...

1236
01:04:47.043 --> 01:04:50.002
You come here! 
You're my lucky charm!

1237
01:04:50.085 --> 01:04:51.960
Dharmu! Get her a chair!

1238
01:04:52.043 --> 01:04:53.793
- Come sit!
- Okay...


1239
01:04:53.877 --> 01:04:56.043
Arjun, you come here.
You're my lucky charm!


1240
01:04:56.127 --> 01:04:58.960
Yes, Mr. Choksi... I'll
just go to the loo and come.


1241
01:04:59.043 --> 01:05:00.252
Okay!

1242
01:05:00.752 --> 01:05:01.835
Come on!

1243
01:05:02.002 --> 01:05:04.168
Arjun... Did you invite her?

1244
01:05:04.252 --> 01:05:05.127
Who her?

1245
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:06.960
Anu Aunty, man!

1246
01:05:07.377 --> 01:05:08.960
He's always drunk!

1247
01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:11.460
I didn't invite her...

1248
01:05:11.543 --> 01:05:13.502
Lowest card wins!

1249
01:05:21.043 --> 01:05:22.877
Dad the party's screwed now!

1250
01:05:23.335 --> 01:05:26.418
I called all my old bank colleagues!

1251
01:05:26.502 --> 01:05:28.335
It would be strange to not call her!

1252
01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:30.460
And you know when Dadu was sick...

1253
01:05:30.585 --> 01:05:32.585
- Can you'll please taste this soup?

1254
01:05:32.918 --> 01:05:34.252
ls the salt okay?

1255
01:05:35.168 --> 01:05:37.960
- Something wrong?
- No, no... nothing.


1256
01:05:39.127 --> 01:05:40.377
Needs more salt...

1257
01:05:40.543 --> 01:05:42.043
Okay, why are you making such a face?!

1258
01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:44.168
I just have to use the loo...

1259
01:05:44.293 --> 01:05:45.293
SO go!

1260
01:05:45.377 --> 01:05:46.877
Taste it, please?

1261
01:05:48.543 --> 01:05:50.627
- Hello! How are you?
- Hi, Anu Aunty!


1262
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:52.668
- Just needs a little salt, Morn...

1263
01:05:52.752 --> 01:05:53.668
Ummm... Hi!

1264
01:05:54.502 --> 01:05:56.168
Dadu's outside, let's go meet him?

1265
01:05:56.252 --> 01:05:58.210
I thought I'll meet you first.

1266
01:05:58.293 --> 01:05:59.418
Really...

1267
01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:01.710
- Hello!
- Hi, Anu Aunty...


1268
01:06:01.835 --> 01:06:04.585
- Hi, Harsh!
- Hi... Hi, Anu...


1269
01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:07.252
Here! Your favorite caramel cookies!

1270
01:06:07.335 --> 01:06:08.543
Oh ya! Thank you!

1271
01:06:08.627 --> 01:06:11.043
When you were a kid you
used to always come to me...


1272
01:06:11.127 --> 01:06:13.335
and ask me for "just one more"!

1273
01:06:13.543 --> 01:06:14.835
Really!

1274
01:06:15.835 --> 01:06:18.002
- I'm so happy to
see you after so long.


1275
01:06:18.168 --> 01:06:19.918
Look at you now! Handsome!

1276
01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:22.127
- Who invited her?

1277
01:06:22.377 --> 01:06:23.918
Dadu's right there...

1278
01:06:24.043 --> 01:06:25.335
- Hi, Sunita!

1279
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:26.793
You look nice!

1280
01:06:26.877 --> 01:06:27.627
I need some ice...

1281
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:29.835
- I'll get it!
- Get her out of my house.


1282
01:06:30.293 --> 01:06:32.293
- Please, Harsh!
- She's a guest...


1283
01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:34.127
- Guest, my bloody foot!
- Morn, please...


1284
01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:36.210
- Sunita...
- Anu, one sec.


1285
01:06:36.377 --> 01:06:39.793
I raise you 10!

1286
01:06:41.502 --> 01:06:42.710
Aye!

1287
01:06:42.793 --> 01:06:44.002
- This is cheating!

1288
01:06:44.502 --> 01:06:46.627
Like I would cheat on my birthday!

1289
01:06:46.877 --> 01:06:50.835
Please! You're so old now,
you're relying on a child for help!


1290
01:06:50.918 --> 01:06:52.627
One second!
Choksi uncle!


1291
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:54.543
I'm taking my 30 bucks back.

1292
01:06:54.752 --> 01:06:57.210
Calm down, everybody!

1293
01:06:57.418 --> 01:06:58.960
One second, everybody!

1294
01:06:59.168 --> 01:07:01.960
- I'm really sorry...
- I don't want to upset anybody...


1295
01:07:02.168 --> 01:07:04.168
I'm sorry... I shouldn't have come.

1296
01:07:04.502 --> 01:07:06.085
I'm so sorry... Come with me.

1297
01:07:06.252 --> 01:07:07.335
Anu...

1298
01:07:08.793 --> 01:07:10.085
What's he saying sorry for?!

1299
01:07:10.252 --> 01:07:12.585
Are you done? Happy now?

1300
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:13.918
ls this how we treat friends?!

1301
01:07:14.127 --> 01:07:15.835
Stuffing your face with
cake has made you so fat!


1302
01:07:16.002 --> 01:07:17.752
- How dare you call me fat!

1303
01:07:17.918 --> 01:07:20.168
I hope you fall in a ditch!

1304
01:07:20.377 --> 01:07:21.710
Come here, Boobly!

1305
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:24.877
Do something!

1306
01:07:25.085 --> 01:07:28.252
You come to my house
and call me a cheat!


1307
01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:29.960
How many such friends do you have?

1308
01:07:30.127 --> 01:07:31.627
Just tell me all at once.

1309
01:07:31.752 --> 01:07:33.668
You're a lunatic.
You belong in an asylum.


1310
01:07:33.752 --> 01:07:35.127
- Dad...
- Good plan!


1311
01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:36.627
Just get me out of the way!

1312
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:38.210
I'm going to break this goddamn thing!

1313
01:07:38.293 --> 01:07:39.793
<i>'</i> Dad!

1314
01:07:40.085 --> 01:07:41.793
I'll give you a slap!

1315
01:07:42.335 --> 01:07:44.668
Boobly, are you mad?!
Put Uncle down!


1316
01:07:45.043 --> 01:07:47.668
- Don't put him down!

1317
01:07:48.585 --> 01:07:50.210
- Dad!
- Ma, please!


1318
01:07:50.793 --> 01:07:53.127
- I'd like to see what you can do!
- Dad, calm down!


1319
01:07:54.752 --> 01:07:58.293
- Put him down!
- ls he nuts?!


1320
01:07:59.252 --> 01:08:00.918
Put him down, you bloody lunatic!

1321
01:08:01.127 --> 01:08:03.168
<i>'</i> Dad!

1322
01:08:03.335 --> 01:08:06.043
I'll break your limbs
if you do that again!


1323
01:08:06.127 --> 01:08:07.918
How dare he bring her here!

1324
01:08:08.168 --> 01:08:09.960
How dare Harsh do that!

1325
01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:11.460
Yeah, Ma...

1326
01:08:11.543 --> 01:08:14.668
- He humiliated in front of the world!
- Morn, you're absolutely right...


1327
01:08:14.835 --> 01:08:17.168
I still have to go to the loo.
Just wait here <i>2</i> seconds...


1328
01:08:17.252 --> 01:08:19.293
Please don't move!

1329
01:08:24.752 --> 01:08:27.293
- Choksi Uncle, 
I apologise...

1330
01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:29.002
Uncle, wait...

1331
01:08:29.168 --> 01:08:31.335
Look here, donkey!

1332
01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:34.085
Cookies, it seems...

1333
01:08:34.335 --> 01:08:36.377
- Dadu...
- Fogie, look here!


1334
01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.085
- Dadu, stop!

1335
01:08:39.168 --> 01:08:41.377
She forgot her goddamn cookies!

1336
01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.627
What a great party, huh?

1337
01:08:54.543 --> 01:08:56.085
Having fun?

1338
01:08:57.293 --> 01:09:00.210
It's over! Go home!

1339
01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.752
I'm serious! Go home!

1340
01:09:22.043 --> 01:09:23.752
Where were you?

1341
01:09:25.293 --> 01:09:26.835
Do you have any sense at all?

1342
01:09:26.918 --> 01:09:29.002
Couldn't you sit
with mum for 5 minutes?


1343
01:10:03.293 --> 01:10:04.835
I don't know about Dadu...

1344
01:10:05.793 --> 01:10:07.543
but everyone
else sure was surprised.


1345
01:10:07.627 --> 01:10:08.418
Yeah!

1346
01:10:08.627 --> 01:10:10.752
Do you think Dad and Anu Aunty...?

1347
01:10:11.002 --> 01:10:12.293
No, man...

1348
01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.877
Dad's a lot of things but he's
not a cheater.


1349
01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.752
Morn just overreacts...

1350
01:10:17.335 --> 01:10:18.460
Morn and overreaction?!

1351
01:10:18.585 --> 01:10:22.668
Shut up... How's your
novel coming along?


1352
01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:24.335
Have you got a publisher?

1353
01:10:24.418 --> 01:10:26.752
No, man... Same old crap...

1354
01:10:27.377 --> 01:10:28.252
What crap?

1355
01:10:28.377 --> 01:10:32.127
Everyone wants a happy ending...

1356
01:10:33.335 --> 01:10:34.377
And your story?

1357
01:10:34.877 --> 01:10:35.752
It's real.

1358
01:10:37.335 --> 01:10:40.127
And real life never
guarantees a happy ending...


1359
01:10:42.627 --> 01:10:44.668
Isn't that why we
look for it in stories?


1360
01:10:54.585 --> 01:10:58.002
Sometimes I wish
I had finished college...


1361
01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:00.585
Or completed the photography course...

1362
01:11:00.835 --> 01:11:05.043
Maybe I wouldn't be as successful as
you, but at least I'd have a backup.


1363
01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:08.085
Don't be so stressed...

1364
01:11:08.585 --> 01:11:10.710
Easy for you to say...

1365
01:11:11.002 --> 01:11:14.293
You're a successful novelist...
an entrepreneur...


1366
01:11:16.127 --> 01:11:20.585
and what am I? I'm just a part-time
bartender struggling to be a writer.


1367
01:11:20.918 --> 01:11:22.627
What's wrong with that?

1368
01:11:23.168 --> 01:11:25.793
Every struggler works
part-time... I've done it!


1369
01:11:26.252 --> 01:11:28.002
Yeah, but for how long?!

1370
01:11:30.752 --> 01:11:34.252
As a kid, I used to wonder
what you had that I didn't...


1371
01:11:35.418 --> 01:11:39.002
lt took me all these years to
realize that this is who I am...


1372
01:11:39.668 --> 01:11:41.585
I'm second best...

1373
01:11:42.918 --> 01:11:44.585
I'm just a runner up.

1374
01:11:52.002 --> 01:11:53.377
Listen...

1375
01:11:54.627 --> 01:11:56.210
if you're comfortable with it...

1376
01:11:56.418 --> 01:11:58.377
I can talk to an agent for you.

1377
01:11:58.835 --> 01:12:00.835
I could even read your
novel... give you feedback.


1378
01:12:01.168 --> 01:12:02.377
If you're okay with it.

1379
01:12:05.585 --> 01:12:07.460
I haven't carried a copy with me...

1380
01:12:08.793 --> 01:12:12.502
Well, okay... But if you
ever need help... just ask.


1381
01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:14.168
Ya!

1382
01:12:14.293 --> 01:12:16.168
Or else you could give it to Morn...

1383
01:12:16.543 --> 01:12:19.002
Her feedback is surprisingly great.

1384
01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:21.127
Really...

1385
01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:24.710
Tell me something...

1386
01:12:25.752 --> 01:12:27.502
What do you think of Tia?

1387
01:12:28.127 --> 01:12:29.168
Tia...

1388
01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:33.418
Dude, she is so hot!
I'm going for it.


1389
01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.835
Really?

1390
01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:39.460
Look at your face!

1391
01:12:39.543 --> 01:12:42.502
I have no interest in her.
Relax. You make your move...


1392
01:12:42.918 --> 01:12:44.460
I'm very happy in my relationship.

1393
01:12:44.877 --> 01:12:46.502
Ah... video chat!

1394
01:12:47.210 --> 01:12:48.668
She's hot or what?

1395
01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:50.585
She's good.

1396
01:12:51.543 --> 01:12:53.335
Dude, but you can't even drive...

1397
01:12:53.418 --> 01:12:54.793
I can please her in other ways!

1398
01:12:54.877 --> 01:12:56.085
- Really!
- Want me to teach you?


1399
01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:57.418
Yeah, right.

1400
01:12:58.293 --> 01:12:59.793
Actually, today let me teach you.

1401
01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:01.502
Catch!

1402
01:13:02.752 --> 01:13:04.460
- Accelerate, man...

1403
01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:06.418
- The bloody music is distracting me!

1404
01:13:06.543 --> 01:13:08.210
- Careful, careful, careful!

1405
01:13:08.502 --> 01:13:09.543
- Sorry, bro!

1406
01:13:09.710 --> 01:13:11.168
You almost killed him!

1407
01:13:11.377 --> 01:13:12.543
You drive then, Schumacher!

1408
01:13:12.668 --> 01:13:15.377
Shut this guy up, man!
Why is he honking at me!


1409
01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:16.627
Chill, man!

1410
01:13:17.168 --> 01:13:18.377
Geishu! Attack!

1411
01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:21.502
Are you in labor or what?!

1412
01:13:21.585 --> 01:13:23.585
Okay, I have an idea...

1413
01:13:23.835 --> 01:13:25.168
- Something I saw on the internet...

1414
01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:26.668
Drive on the side...

1415
01:13:26.918 --> 01:13:28.668
- What are you planning?
- Just wait...


1416
01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:32.627
- What are you doing, man?
- You drive like an old lady!


1417
01:13:32.877 --> 01:13:33.835
Hi!

1418
01:13:36.335 --> 01:13:37.252
Take that!

1419
01:13:40.293 --> 01:13:42.835
- Arjun! Arjun! What do I do?!
- Brake!! Brake!! Brake!!


1420
01:13:47.543 --> 01:13:48.377
Geishu!

1421
01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:51.877
Uh oh...

1422
01:13:52.002 --> 01:13:53.335
Oh, man...

1423
01:13:59.752 --> 01:14:00.918
What do we do?

1424
01:14:06.668 --> 01:14:08.252
There's a hammer in the garage...

1425
01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:10.460
Break everything in the house...

1426
01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:12.918
TV, fridge, AC... why not?

1427
01:14:13.002 --> 01:14:16.502
Dad, it's not his fault,
it's mine... I was driving.


1428
01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:26.210
What an embarrassing scolding!

1429
01:14:26.543 --> 01:14:28.002
He didn't even call
you an idiot or a jackass!


1430
01:14:28.085 --> 01:14:29.293
Come on!

1431
01:14:30.585 --> 01:14:32.210
- Rahul! Arjun!

1432
01:14:32.585 --> 01:14:34.502
Dadu's called everyone inside.

1433
01:14:35.085 --> 01:14:36.835
Let's go, step child.

1434
01:14:43.085 --> 01:14:45.293
This cake tastes like poop!

1435
01:14:46.418 --> 01:14:47.752
You've tasted poop, Dadu?

1436
01:14:47.918 --> 01:14:49.460
Shut up, you fool!

1437
01:14:49.543 --> 01:14:52.002
It's sugar free because
of your diabetes.


1438
01:14:53.418 --> 01:14:58.460
I would rather die eating
sugar than relive that party.


1439
01:15:00.252 --> 01:15:05.293
So... ls anyone going
to apologize for yesterday?


1440
01:15:10.293 --> 01:15:11.918
Okay, I'll start...

1441
01:15:13.168 --> 01:15:18.252
I'm sorry for calling
that idiot Choksi a shithead.


1442
01:15:19.377 --> 01:15:23.793
By the way... who invited Choksi?

1443
01:15:28.752 --> 01:15:29.668
I'm sorry, Dadu...

1444
01:15:31.752 --> 01:15:34.252
And... who invited Anu?

1445
01:15:39.627 --> 01:15:41.293
That was me, again...

1446
01:15:41.835 --> 01:15:44.918
l just thought I'd invite
some of Dad's colleagues...


1447
01:15:46.293 --> 01:15:47.418
Sorry...

1448
01:15:50.168 --> 01:15:51.877
Alright then, that's settled.

1449
01:15:52.127 --> 01:15:53.418
Can I have that?

1450
01:15:53.668 --> 01:15:56.335
- What are you doing?
- My toy... My wish.


1451
01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:57.585
Go stand there.

1452
01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.960
- I want to take a picture...
- Come on, Dad...


1453
01:16:00.127 --> 01:16:01.877
- Okay guys, gather around.

1454
01:16:03.418 --> 01:16:05.377
Smile, smile, smile...

1455
01:16:05.543 --> 01:16:06.543
Smile...

1456
01:16:09.002 --> 01:16:11.377
I wish Shashi and family were here...

1457
01:16:11.543 --> 01:16:14.877
- I would have my happy family photo.
- He's coming tonight.


1458
01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.502
And you can have your family photo!

1459
01:16:16.585 --> 01:16:19.543
We must click the photograph soon...

1460
01:16:19.793 --> 01:16:22.585
or else I might be
the one cut out of it!


1461
01:16:22.835 --> 01:16:25.460
Dad, why must you
always talk about dying?


1462
01:16:25.752 --> 01:16:32.210
Speaking of death... Rahul,
have you booked my burial spot?


1463
01:16:32.335 --> 01:16:33.127
- What?!
- Dadu... I...


1464
01:16:33.335 --> 01:16:34.335
What's this new nonsense?

1465
01:16:34.418 --> 01:16:37.877
Dadu said he wants to be
buried... I thought it was a joke...


1466
01:16:38.002 --> 01:16:39.543
Dad, they won't allow it!

1467
01:16:39.627 --> 01:16:41.502
People can't just
change their religion!


1468
01:16:41.627 --> 01:16:45.460
Whether you're a man or tomato...
once you're dead, you're dead.


1469
01:16:47.127 --> 01:16:49.210
" Arjun!
<i>'</i> Yes?"


1470
01:16:49.502 --> 01:16:52.335
Go book my burial spot...

1471
01:16:52.710 --> 01:16:53.960
Umm... Dad?

1472
01:16:54.418 --> 01:16:55.210
Dad!

1473
01:16:55.293 --> 01:16:59.502
What, Dad-Dad?!
I'm dying, not him!


1474
01:16:59.835 --> 01:17:02.043
I never know what's
going on in this house...


1475
01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:07.835
- Where are we going?

1476
01:17:08.085 --> 01:17:10.377
- On a date.
- Ohh... Hawaii!


1477
01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:13.085
Nah... even better!

1478
01:17:13.377 --> 01:17:14.168
Really!

1479
01:17:14.252 --> 01:17:15.752
Really. You'll see!

1480
01:17:29.710 --> 01:17:32.210
What would your tombstone read?

1481
01:17:34.627 --> 01:17:35.793
Tia Mallik...

1482
01:17:36.793 --> 01:17:38.793
Struck down by Boobly's love...

1483
01:17:39.293 --> 01:17:40.585
For eternity.

1484
01:17:40.752 --> 01:17:42.085
So romantic...

1485
01:17:42.335 --> 01:17:44.252
I can make my pecs dance like Boobly.

1486
01:17:44.877 --> 01:17:46.085
Let's see!

1487
01:17:46.543 --> 01:17:47.710
Hang on...

1488
01:17:50.293 --> 01:17:52.335
- Nothing's happening!
- It's inside the t-shirt!


1489
01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:53.752
Show me, then!

1490
01:17:55.918 --> 01:17:57.710
There's no one like Boobly!

1491
01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:11.335
- I don't know Rahul that well...

1492
01:18:12.293 --> 01:18:13.543
but...

1493
01:18:14.168 --> 01:18:18.418
Maybe the similarities between
your novels really was co-incidence?


1494
01:18:22.543 --> 01:18:23.752
Maybe.

1495
01:18:26.543 --> 01:18:29.252
You're really defending
him... What's up?


1496
01:18:31.085 --> 01:18:32.377
Nothing at all...

1497
01:18:33.002 --> 01:18:34.877
Really... you can tell me!

1498
01:18:43.543 --> 01:18:45.127
I got you something!

1499
01:18:46.085 --> 01:18:47.168
Really?

1500
01:18:47.252 --> 01:18:48.168
What?

1501
01:18:50.127 --> 01:18:51.418
What are you doing?!

1502
01:18:51.502 --> 01:18:52.418
Tia...

1503
01:18:52.502 --> 01:18:53.210
Arjun?

1504
01:18:53.293 --> 01:18:54.752
Will you...

1505
01:18:56.877 --> 01:18:58.168
have some sweet cigarettes?

1506
01:18:58.252 --> 01:19:00.793
Oh my God! Are you serious?!

1507
01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:02.835
How can I say no?

1508
01:19:03.502 --> 01:19:04.210
Light?

1509
01:19:04.293 --> 01:19:05.627
Oh! Yes, ma'am!

1510
01:19:07.543 --> 01:19:08.752
Thank you.

1511
01:19:51.835 --> 01:19:53.877
Listen, I'm sorry about yesterday...

1512
01:19:54.418 --> 01:19:55.710
About Choksi Uncle and Dadu...

1513
01:19:55.835 --> 01:19:57.293
Are you crazy?! I'm sorry!

1514
01:19:57.585 --> 01:19:59.585
My family doesn't
usually behave like that...


1515
01:20:00.752 --> 01:20:01.710
Correction...

1516
01:20:02.252 --> 01:20:04.335
they don't behave
like that in public.


1517
01:20:05.710 --> 01:20:07.793
You should be happy you have a family...

1518
01:20:12.168 --> 01:20:14.585
You really miss your family, don't you?

1519
01:20:22.335 --> 01:20:23.252
$0!

1520
01:20:24.127 --> 01:20:25.960
What would your tombstone say?

1521
01:20:26.668 --> 01:20:28.835
Let's see... Arjun Kapoor...

1522
01:20:29.668 --> 01:20:31.877
from 1985 to...?

1523
01:20:32.210 --> 01:20:33.835
2050, at least!

1524
01:20:33.918 --> 01:20:35.918
Okay, 2050 at least.

1525
01:20:36.835 --> 01:20:38.418
Right... Okay...

1526
01:20:41.502 --> 01:20:43.002
'These are my last few words...'

1527
01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:45.627
'Remember my story... If you can.'

1528
01:20:52.793 --> 01:20:54.252
That's damn impressive!

1529
01:20:54.877 --> 01:20:55.918
You like it?

1530
01:20:57.168 --> 01:20:59.835
I mean... Oh, look at me, 
I'm a writer...

1531
01:21:00.335 --> 01:21:01.377
Yeah...

1532
01:21:01.835 --> 01:21:03.252
Just a little... Thank you.

1533
01:21:11.293 --> 01:21:13.210
- Thanks for these.
- You're welcome...


1534
01:21:13.668 --> 01:21:15.168
How much longer are you here?

1535
01:21:15.793 --> 01:21:17.543
<i>2</i> days... and you?

1536
01:21:18.543 --> 01:21:19.543
4 days...

1537
01:21:19.710 --> 01:21:20.543
Oh.

1538
01:21:26.668 --> 01:21:31.210
Okay, listen... this may sound
a bit crazy... but...


1539
01:21:33.335 --> 01:21:35.210
When we're together...

1540
01:21:36.085 --> 01:21:38.252
I don't know... 
It feels like...

1541
01:21:39.210 --> 01:21:40.668
It just... Something just...

1542
01:21:42.210 --> 01:21:43.335
- Fits?
- Yeah...


1543
01:21:43.793 --> 01:21:45.168
Does it feel like that to you?

1544
01:21:45.710 --> 01:21:46.585
Yeah.

1545
01:21:48.252 --> 01:21:49.585
Stay back a few days?

1546
01:21:52.793 --> 01:21:55.210
If not for me, then for Bunkoo?

1547
01:21:56.085 --> 01:21:56.793
Bunkoo...

1548
01:21:57.127 --> 01:22:01.085
For Bunkoo... I'm convinced. Yes!

1549
01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:03.252
Why few days... at least 10!

1550
01:22:06.252 --> 01:22:07.918
I had a great day...

1551
01:22:08.127 --> 01:22:09.377
Me too.

1552
01:22:10.502 --> 01:22:11.668
Okay, bye!

1553
01:22:15.835 --> 01:22:17.293
- Bye...
- Bye...


1554
01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:19.960
Bye...

1555
01:22:24.877 --> 01:22:26.210
I was in a graveyard.

1556
01:22:28.252 --> 01:22:29.502
On a date...

1557
01:22:34.002 --> 01:22:35.460
With Arjun...

1558
01:22:36.002 --> 01:22:36.877
Yeah...

1559
01:22:40.002 --> 01:22:41.460
I really like him.

1560
01:22:42.752 --> 01:22:47.210
I wish I hadn't made such
a mess by kissing his brother!


1561
01:22:52.877 --> 01:22:55.460
- Arjun, where are the car keys?

1562
01:22:56.543 --> 01:22:58.627
- Arjun! Where is he?!

1563
01:23:05.127 --> 01:23:06.002
" Arjun?"

1564
01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:23.585
What's up?

1565
01:23:24.293 --> 01:23:27.210
Nothing! Mom's phone is here...

1566
01:23:27.377 --> 01:23:29.043
She asked for it...

1567
01:23:29.627 --> 01:23:31.127
- Thanks.
- Yeah.


1568
01:23:32.835 --> 01:23:36.210
- Arjun! Rahul!
- Look who's here! It's Shashi Uncle!


1569
01:23:36.543 --> 01:23:38.627
Sorry Dadu, we missed your birthday...

1570
01:23:40.252 --> 01:23:42.877
And finally!! Uncle! Aunty!

1571
01:23:43.043 --> 01:23:45.002
Hi! How are you?

1572
01:23:45.210 --> 01:23:47.335
- Hi Aunty, looking nice!
- How was the cruise?


1573
01:23:50.252 --> 01:23:51.460
Hey Rahul!

1574
01:23:52.210 --> 01:23:54.918
Look how excited Dadu
is with his wheelchair!


1575
01:23:55.085 --> 01:23:57.293
- Don't worry about it,
we've booked a room at Elgon Hotel.


1576
01:23:57.543 --> 01:23:59.002
He says he's going to a hotel!

1577
01:23:59.168 --> 01:24:03.210
You're home now, idiot...
You're staying here!


1578
01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:07.752
Listen now! I want to take a
picture of the whole family tomorrow.


1579
01:24:07.918 --> 01:24:09.210
- I want to put it up.

1580
01:24:09.293 --> 01:24:12.210
You know that duffer friend of yours...

1581
01:24:12.293 --> 01:24:14.377
The photographer? 
I'll call him!

1582
01:24:14.627 --> 01:24:16.085
- Dharmendra, take the bags in now!

1583
01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:18.210
Take these bags into the room.

1584
01:24:19.585 --> 01:24:21.752
Come on, let's all have dinner.

1585
01:24:23.627 --> 01:24:26.335
- Sunita, look what I found!
- What?


1586
01:24:26.418 --> 01:24:28.293
Gorgeous pictures!

1587
01:24:28.585 --> 01:24:30.418
That's from our honeymoon...

1588
01:24:30.627 --> 01:24:33.293
Some wine for the hardworking ladies!

1589
01:24:33.377 --> 01:24:34.793
Thank you!

1590
01:24:35.085 --> 01:24:37.960
Wow! Please teach her something...

1591
01:24:38.043 --> 01:24:40.210
Shut up! Just go!

1592
01:24:40.252 --> 01:24:43.335
Sunita, ask Timmy to
e-mail me some recipes.


1593
01:24:43.543 --> 01:24:45.293
Sharic just loves this stuff!

1594
01:24:45.418 --> 01:24:47.252
Of course,
she'll e-mail you tomorrow itself!


1595
01:24:47.377 --> 01:24:50.293
Sunita! This custard is delicious!

1596
01:24:51.252 --> 01:24:53.168
- Rahul, you ass!

1597
01:24:53.335 --> 01:24:54.585
Let me have a little!

1598
01:24:54.710 --> 01:24:55.502
- Dad...

1599
01:24:55.585 --> 01:24:57.127
Dad! You're not allowed!
Doctors' instructions!


1600
01:24:57.210 --> 01:24:58.252
Just one!

1601
01:24:58.335 --> 01:25:00.835
Sunita, you look like
a Bollywood actress!


1602
01:25:00.918 --> 01:25:02.002
Let me see!

1603
01:25:03.502 --> 01:25:04.793
Wow! Seriously!

1604
01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:07.127
- She really does!

1605
01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:09.543
Wow...

1606
01:25:09.877 --> 01:25:12.210
Please, Sharic... I was way
better looking than you!


1607
01:25:12.293 --> 01:25:14.752
Girls used to line
up here for Shashi and me!


1608
01:25:14.835 --> 01:25:15.752
Of course!

1609
01:25:15.918 --> 01:25:17.835
- Rubbish, Dad...
- Hang on!


1610
01:25:18.377 --> 01:25:20.377
They used to line up for me.

1611
01:25:21.002 --> 01:25:23.085
- Absolutely right!
- Correct, Dadu!


1612
01:25:23.168 --> 01:25:25.043
- And what was Grandma doing?
- She was long gone!


1613
01:25:25.210 --> 01:25:27.627
Whatever it is! 
I miss those days...

1614
01:25:27.835 --> 01:25:30.127
I wouldn't give those memories
up for a million dollars...


1615
01:25:30.252 --> 01:25:31.460
Oh, Uncle...

1616
01:25:31.543 --> 01:25:33.377
Please! You'd eat poop
for a million dollars!


1617
01:25:33.543 --> 01:25:34.585
- Yuck!
- Dad!


1618
01:25:36.002 --> 01:25:38.043
You'll would all eat
poop for 10 million dollars!


1619
01:25:38.210 --> 01:25:40.168
Sharic would eat poop for 50 bucks!

1620
01:25:41.543 --> 01:25:42.460
So Sharia...

1621
01:25:43.168 --> 01:25:45.002
ls the guitar just for girls or...

1622
01:25:45.085 --> 01:25:47.293
- No, no! I play!
- Play some Mehmood!


1623
01:25:47.377 --> 01:25:49.710
- Justin Bieber, bro!
- No Justin Bieber!


1624
01:25:49.877 --> 01:25:51.210
Play something vintage!

1625
01:25:51.918 --> 01:25:54.210
Rahul also sings!
Rahul, come on, sing!


1626
01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:57.127
Please, please! Come on, Rahul!

1627
01:25:57.210 --> 01:25:59.043
- Sing what...
- Your Dad's favorite!


1628
01:25:59.127 --> 01:26:00.835
The one he sang at his wedding!
Remember?


1629
01:26:00.918 --> 01:26:02.210
Me?! No way...

1630
01:26:02.502 --> 01:26:04.293
"The way you look tonight!"

1631
01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:07.377
In the voice of Lata
Mangeshkar... Rahul!


1632
01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:08.585
Let's

1633
01:26:09.085 --> 01:26:11.210
1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...

1634
01:27:07.752 --> 01:27:08.585
- WOW, Dad!

1635
01:27:38.543 --> 01:27:40.002
- Well done, Rahul-
- Kapoor!


1636
01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:41.293
- Wonderfully done!

1637
01:27:41.502 --> 01:27:44.043
Goodnight, my little princess!

1638
01:27:44.168 --> 01:27:46.627
You smell like Geishu!

1639
01:27:53.585 --> 01:27:54.960
Goodnight.

1640
01:27:56.210 --> 01:27:57.335
Goodnight.

1641
01:28:00.835 --> 01:28:03.210
I haven't seen you this happy
in a long time... It suits you.


1642
01:28:07.252 --> 01:28:08.335
Goodnight!

1643
01:28:13.210 --> 01:28:15.543
Dadu... Aunty got this for Morn!

1644
01:28:15.627 --> 01:28:18.918
Shut up and tell me how
long I have to keep this on!


1645
01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:23.460
15 minutes...

1646
01:28:24.335 --> 01:28:25.252
15 minutes?

1647
01:28:26.335 --> 01:28:28.252
Okay, switch off the lights.

1648
01:28:29.043 --> 01:28:29.877
Why?!

1649
01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:32.252
Because I said so!

1650
01:28:34.752 --> 01:28:37.418
Open the drawer... the first one!

1651
01:28:38.418 --> 01:28:39.835
See my underwear there?

1652
01:28:40.002 --> 01:28:41.002
What are you making me do?!

1653
01:28:41.085 --> 01:28:43.377
There's a box underneath. Open it...

1654
01:28:47.043 --> 01:28:48.627
Take the joint out.

1655
01:28:51.210 --> 01:28:53.043
Dadu... You'll have me killed!

1656
01:28:53.418 --> 01:28:55.502
Remember this? Gulmarg...

1657
01:28:57.710 --> 01:28:59.710
- Sonmarg.
- Yeah, Sonmarg...


1658
01:29:00.293 --> 01:29:05.877
And that ski instructor
who kept trying to grab your hand.


1659
01:29:06.210 --> 01:29:09.543
- Remember this?
- When you threw all my clothes out?


1660
01:29:09.918 --> 01:29:14.877
So? You promised me a day
out and worked all day instead.


1661
01:29:15.377 --> 01:29:19.585
Didn't I make it up
to you with my towel dance?


1662
01:29:21.918 --> 01:29:23.710
Yes, I saw the pictures...

1663
01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:28.585
You look nice.
A tad bit overweight... but cute.


1664
01:29:30.043 --> 01:29:32.210
But do you have
to sit next to Chris?

1665
01:29:33.418 --> 01:29:35.752
No, I'm not the jealous type.

1666
01:29:36.835 --> 01:29:39.168
Listen... I'll talk to you later, yeah?

1667
01:29:39.627 --> 01:29:40.418
I love you too.

1668
01:29:42.418 --> 01:29:44.085
2 drags and you're
already breaking glasses?


1669
01:29:44.210 --> 01:29:46.002
You're going to get me killed...

1670
01:29:46.085 --> 01:29:48.793
Just relax, son...

1671
01:29:52.835 --> 01:29:54.752
- Hold this, hold this!
- Why me?!


1672
01:29:56.252 --> 01:29:58.377
- It's Rahul! Come on in.
- Hey...


1673
01:29:59.585 --> 01:30:00.377
What's going on?

1674
01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:03.585
I've applied a mud cap...
The doctor recommended it...


1675
01:30:03.877 --> 01:30:05.335
Yeah, the doctors...

1676
01:30:08.502 --> 01:30:11.460
If you're done praying,
take the incense out...


1677
01:30:11.710 --> 01:30:12.877
Ummmm.

1678
01:30:19.710 --> 01:30:21.793
Let's see the... incense.

1679
01:30:23.127 --> 01:30:24.752
Oh, damn it!

1680
01:30:25.585 --> 01:30:26.585
Show me!

1681
01:30:27.252 --> 01:30:29.418
Busted!

1682
01:30:31.085 --> 01:30:32.877
Outlaws...

1683
01:30:33.210 --> 01:30:35.127
Wicked!

1684
01:30:44.502 --> 01:30:47.002
We used to be so happy...

1685
01:30:51.293 --> 01:30:53.627
Sunita, I was thinking...

1686
01:30:55.002 --> 01:30:56.335
If you want to...

1687
01:30:57.252 --> 01:31:02.460
start your catering
business... you should.


1688
01:31:09.585 --> 01:31:13.460
I'll try and help
in whatever way I can...


1689
01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:16.835
ls this the alcohol talking?

1690
01:31:20.085 --> 01:31:22.418
What would Grandma think
if she were here today...


1691
01:31:22.585 --> 01:31:28.585
You have no idea... She would be
taking a hit or two of the joint herself!


1692
01:31:29.002 --> 01:31:31.002
- Dadu!
- What nonsense, Dadu!


1693
01:31:31.168 --> 01:31:33.502
I'm telling you guys!

1694
01:31:34.002 --> 01:31:39.168
We used be quite the
'wild couple' in our times!


1695
01:31:40.127 --> 01:31:43.085
Then I've definitely fallen
on you guys!


1696
01:31:44.085 --> 01:31:46.627
This poor fellow turned
out like Morn and Dad...


1697
01:31:46.710 --> 01:31:48.252
What rubbish! I'm Wild.

1698
01:31:48.877 --> 01:31:49.877
- You?!
- Yeah!


1699
01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:51.585
- I'm wild!
- You're wild?


1700
01:31:51.752 --> 01:31:53.668
- I'm wild, dude!
- Wild people can drive!


1701
01:31:53.752 --> 01:31:56.335
- Shut up, I'm wild!
- Ya, right...


1702
01:31:56.502 --> 01:31:59.377
Okay, fine.
Tell us one of your wild tales.


1703
01:32:00.377 --> 01:32:04.293
In Hawaii last year...
I got drunk and got a tattoo.


1704
01:32:04.585 --> 01:32:06.418
What?! Tattoo?!

1705
01:32:06.710 --> 01:32:08.668
ls that a tattoo of pigeons?!

1706
01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:12.085
He got a tattoo!!!

1707
01:32:14.627 --> 01:32:18.418
Sunita, I just got tangled
up in so many things...


1708
01:32:21.335 --> 01:32:23.627
Before I knew it,
time had slipped away...


1709
01:32:26.043 --> 01:32:27.168
I'm sorry.

1710
01:32:28.752 --> 01:32:31.627
I may be drunk, but it's the truth...

1711
01:32:37.543 --> 01:32:39.752
Can't we be happy again?

1712
01:32:43.293 --> 01:32:44.710
We can try...

1713
01:32:52.377 --> 01:32:53.543
You're lost in thought?

1714
01:32:54.710 --> 01:32:56.127
I was just thinking...

1715
01:32:56.418 --> 01:32:58.710
For 10 million dollars...
I could eat some poop.


1716
01:32:58.793 --> 01:33:00.752
You'll eat it for 5!

1717
01:33:00.835 --> 01:33:02.335
Yeah... but with cheese.

1718
01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:04.002
Yuck!

1719
01:33:06.585 --> 01:33:08.335
Dude, where did
Dadu score that shit from?


1720
01:33:09.418 --> 01:33:10.835
Who knows...

1721
01:33:12.752 --> 01:33:15.627
You're not as perfect as you act...

1722
01:33:16.085 --> 01:33:19.252
How did you become the favorite son?

1723
01:33:22.002 --> 01:33:23.418
That's not true.

1724
01:33:24.085 --> 01:33:25.877
Morn and Dad love us equally.

1725
01:33:30.085 --> 01:33:32.377
You asshole... you can't even
say that with a straight face!


1726
01:33:32.502 --> 01:33:33.835
I am serious.

1727
01:33:36.043 --> 01:33:38.543
I would take your
place in a heartbeat.


1728
01:33:38.752 --> 01:33:40.002
Shut up...

1729
01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:43.002
Arjun, can I tell you something?

1730
01:33:45.085 --> 01:33:46.418
Something no one knows...

1731
01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:52.793
Arjun!

1732
01:34:14.918 --> 01:34:16.460
I thought you could wear this...

1733
01:34:16.627 --> 01:34:18.377
- ls it okay?
- Thank you.


1734
01:34:21.502 --> 01:34:22.793
Coffee...

1735
01:34:25.752 --> 01:34:27.960
I'll just go give
the car to the mechanic.


1736
01:34:28.335 --> 01:34:29.335
Now?!

1737
01:34:29.418 --> 01:34:30.835
Yeah, just get it out of the way...

1738
01:34:31.043 --> 01:34:33.627
Everyone’s waiting outside!

1739
01:34:36.543 --> 01:34:38.418
I'll be back quickly. 
Where's Shashi?

1740
01:34:38.502 --> 01:34:40.502
- Pleasure meeting you.
- You too, sir.


1741
01:34:40.627 --> 01:34:43.127
- Okay, we'll talk later.
- Yeah. Sorry, I'm just...


1742
01:34:43.293 --> 01:34:44.377
Bye.

1743
01:34:46.335 --> 01:34:47.168
What's up, man?

1744
01:34:47.252 --> 01:34:48.835
You'll carry on...
I'll come in a bit.


1745
01:34:51.085 --> 01:34:51.793
Very bad...

1746
01:34:51.877 --> 01:34:53.835
I can't let you do this. No, Arjun...

1747
01:34:54.085 --> 01:34:58.377
- The car needs to go back.
- I'll come on my own!


1748
01:34:58.835 --> 01:35:01.418
That's where my family
portrait will be.


1749
01:35:01.877 --> 01:35:06.335
Timmy, you haven't sent the recipes!
Okay wait, I'll check.


1750
01:35:06.793 --> 01:35:08.668
Wow, Sunita, you look lovely!

1751
01:35:09.002 --> 01:35:10.168
Just speaking to Timmy for you!

1752
01:35:10.543 --> 01:35:12.710
I'll check on Rahul's laptop...

1753
01:35:13.585 --> 01:35:15.877
Uff, Dad... Too handsome!

1754
01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:18.460
No, no... Aunty wished me already.

1755
01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:21.585
Thank you for calling... and wishing...

1756
01:35:22.002 --> 01:35:23.043
Bye.

1757
01:35:24.710 --> 01:35:26.210
ls today your birthday?

1758
01:35:27.835 --> 01:35:29.002
Seriously?

1759
01:35:30.127 --> 01:35:32.627
T! Happy birthday!

1760
01:35:32.793 --> 01:35:33.710
Thank you...

1761
01:35:33.918 --> 01:35:36.668
I'd have brought a
cutout of Boobly if I knew!


1762
01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:42.752
Why aren't you more excited
about your birthday?!


1763
01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:49.502
- It's loading, hang on!

1764
01:35:49.835 --> 01:35:50.668
- Sunita!

1765
01:35:50.835 --> 01:35:52.960
Sorry, one sec... 
I'll call back.

1766
01:35:53.085 --> 01:35:54.335
Which one?

1767
01:35:54.502 --> 01:35:55.502
This one!

1768
01:35:55.627 --> 01:35:56.627
<i>'</i> Okay!

1769
01:35:58.085 --> 01:36:00.918
You should think of investing
in my Artist Retreat!


1770
01:36:03.335 --> 01:36:05.210
Raj, stop the car... Stop the car.

1771
01:36:06.002 --> 01:36:07.085
What's wrong?

1772
01:36:07.585 --> 01:36:10.002
No, l just remembered
I have to see a friend...


1773
01:36:10.210 --> 01:36:11.377
Should I wait?

1774
01:36:13.668 --> 01:36:15.377
No, you guys carry on.

1775
01:36:15.835 --> 01:36:18.002
- Do you know the way?
- Yes, sir!


1776
01:36:46.252 --> 01:36:47.418
Hello? Dad?

1777
01:36:47.627 --> 01:36:48.835
- I'll be home in a bit...

1778
01:36:49.002 --> 01:36:52.668
Just finishing work at the garage...
will be home in half an hour.


1779
01:36:56.168 --> 01:36:57.835
Time to go, right?

1780
01:37:02.252 --> 01:37:05.460
Seems like your mind
is made up... and that's fine.


1781
01:37:05.710 --> 01:37:09.335
Nothing's fine... but
I'm trying to change that.


1782
01:37:32.335 --> 01:37:35.293
It was my 13th birthday...

1783
01:37:36.335 --> 01:37:41.668
Morn and Dad were returning
from Canada after my Uncle's surgery...


1784
01:37:44.002 --> 01:37:45.627
I was really pissed off...

1785
01:37:46.543 --> 01:37:49.752
They were missing my birthday...

1786
01:37:52.668 --> 01:37:55.877
They called me before
boarding the flight...


1787
01:37:57.543 --> 01:37:59.127
I was angry...

1788
01:38:00.627 --> 01:38:03.168
So told them not
to bother coming back...


1789
01:38:03.752 --> 01:38:07.377
I don't need a Morn and Dad!
I'm fine alone! Don't come back.


1790
01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.293
The plane crashed.

1791
01:38:19.377 --> 01:38:22.335
My Uncle waited 2 days to tell me...

1792
01:38:22.502 --> 01:38:24.502
Til they found the bodies.

1793
01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:37.252
It was the last time...
I ever spoke to them...


1794
01:38:37.335 --> 01:38:40.043
and I was horrible...

1795
01:38:41.835 --> 01:38:45.002
That phone call haunts
me on every birthday!


1796
01:38:46.085 --> 01:38:48.043
I could have said so many things...

1797
01:38:50.335 --> 01:38:51.960
Like I love you!

1798
01:38:52.543 --> 01:38:56.002
I love you... Just come back...
I miss you!


1799
01:38:56.335 --> 01:38:58.085
I've missed you!

1800
01:39:05.543 --> 01:39:07.585
Just please come back...

1801
01:39:08.377 --> 01:39:10.168
It's all I wanted to say.

1802
01:39:33.793 --> 01:39:35.043
Hello...

1803
01:39:36.877 --> 01:39:37.918
ls Dad there?

1804
01:39:39.918 --> 01:39:41.002
Rahul...

1805
01:39:42.002 --> 01:39:43.418
Stop!

1806
01:40:05.252 --> 01:40:06.252
Rahul!

1807
01:40:53.002 --> 01:40:53.960
Sorry.

1808
01:40:55.543 --> 01:40:56.918
Excuse me for a second...

1809
01:41:05.210 --> 01:41:07.168
You have to tell him.

1810
01:41:13.335 --> 01:41:14.210
-Arjun...

1811
01:41:15.418 --> 01:41:17.585
I have to tell you something.

1812
01:41:19.127 --> 01:41:23.793
Please don't judge me...
I was drunk.


1813
01:41:24.377 --> 01:41:27.085
- Catch that thief! Catch her!

1814
01:41:27.293 --> 01:41:30.168
Rahul! Look what I taught the kids!

1815
01:41:35.168 --> 01:41:38.835
- Tell everyone to hurry up!
- It's going to rain...


1816
01:41:39.002 --> 01:41:40.877
Bite your black tongue you jackass!

1817
01:41:41.085 --> 01:41:41.918
Rahul!

1818
01:41:42.127 --> 01:41:44.168
Do you have a belt for Sharia?

1819
01:41:44.377 --> 01:41:45.710
|1|check“.

1820
01:41:48.210 --> 01:41:49.210
Hi!

1821
01:41:52.627 --> 01:41:54.252
You were calling earlier...

1822
01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:59.460
No! Why would you say that?

1823
01:42:03.418 --> 01:42:06.043
Nothing, just
having a bit of a rough day...


1824
01:42:12.627 --> 01:42:13.627
Thanks...

1825
01:42:16.793 --> 01:42:17.752
What's wrong, Ma?

1826
01:42:19.002 --> 01:42:20.668
You're hiding something from me.

1827
01:42:24.085 --> 01:42:25.835
Listen, I'll just call you back.

1828
01:42:29.168 --> 01:42:30.293
What are you hiding?

1829
01:42:33.043 --> 01:42:34.793
Do you know where Dad is?

1830
01:42:35.002 --> 01:42:36.377
Don't change the topic!

1831
01:42:36.752 --> 01:42:38.085
Answer me!

1832
01:42:39.418 --> 01:42:43.252
Whose photographs are on your laptop?

1833
01:42:44.710 --> 01:42:46.918
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.


1834
01:42:47.377 --> 01:42:49.293
They're definitely
not your girlfriend's.


1835
01:42:53.210 --> 01:42:54.918
Why were you looking at my laptop?

1836
01:42:55.293 --> 01:42:56.960
Move, Geishu.

1837
01:42:58.418 --> 01:42:59.585
Do you even have a girlfriend?

1838
01:42:59.668 --> 01:43:00.668
- Move, Geishu!

1839
01:43:01.085 --> 01:43:02.418
I want a name.

1840
01:43:02.543 --> 01:43:05.127
- Tell me the name!
- None of your business!


1841
01:43:05.627 --> 01:43:07.877
Rahul, don't lie to me.

1842
01:43:09.418 --> 01:43:13.127
Those photographs...
This is a misunderstanding, right?


1843
01:43:14.293 --> 01:43:15.752
- I don't have time for this.
- Rahul!


1844
01:43:18.418 --> 01:43:19.543
Ma, don't!

1845
01:43:22.377 --> 01:43:23.752
This is your girlfriend?!

1846
01:43:25.168 --> 01:43:26.127
This!

1847
01:43:26.627 --> 01:43:27.627
Disgusting!

1848
01:43:28.752 --> 01:43:30.252
Do you feel no shame?!

1849
01:43:30.710 --> 01:43:32.627
When did these lies start?

1850
01:43:34.002 --> 01:43:36.627
Did you think about us even once?!

1851
01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:38.377
About Dadu, about Dad...

1852
01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:40.127
Think about Dad?!

1853
01:43:41.918 --> 01:43:44.002
Dad told you he's
at the garage, right?


1854
01:43:44.377 --> 01:43:47.168
No one's a saint in
this house... Everybody lies!


1855
01:43:47.377 --> 01:43:49.043
So instead of finding faults with me...

1856
01:43:49.127 --> 01:43:50.293
save your own bloody marriage!

1857
01:43:50.377 --> 01:43:51.418
Shut up!

1858
01:43:54.877 --> 01:43:56.502
Rahul, the belt...

1859
01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:59.627
- All okay?
- Yeah, it's fine...


1860
01:43:59.793 --> 01:44:02.377
I'll just get it.
You go, I'll bring it...


1861
01:44:03.418 --> 01:44:05.710
- Okay... Ready... and smile!

1862
01:44:06.585 --> 01:44:07.210
- Got it!

1863
01:44:07.627 --> 01:44:09.335
- Now... take a picture of me
as I pretend to be dead.


1864
01:44:09.418 --> 01:44:10.543
Like this.

1865
01:44:11.627 --> 01:44:12.668
Wait!

1866
01:44:14.377 --> 01:44:15.835
- Ready.
- I'll click?


1867
01:44:16.043 --> 01:44:17.418
Got it. You look
very cute, Dadu.


1868
01:44:17.502 --> 01:44:19.627
If my Grandma was alive,
I'd totally set you two up.


1869
01:44:19.752 --> 01:44:21.752
- Really?
- What about your mum?


1870
01:44:23.127 --> 01:44:24.502
- Harsh!
- Yes?


1871
01:44:25.210 --> 01:44:27.418
- Tell everyone to hurry up!
- Okay...


1872
01:44:27.502 --> 01:44:30.043
- It'll get too overcast
to take the picture!


1873
01:44:40.085 --> 01:44:41.918
You said you were at the garage.

1874
01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:45.168
Rahul, I...

1875
01:44:46.668 --> 01:44:48.418
You're a disgusting person, Dad.

1876
01:44:51.002 --> 01:44:53.627
I was the one who
took a stand for you.


1877
01:44:55.835 --> 01:44:57.043
I'm sorry...

1878
01:44:58.210 --> 01:44:59.418
You're sorry?!

1879
01:45:01.835 --> 01:45:03.918
It's not what you think, Rahul...

1880
01:45:07.293 --> 01:45:09.085
Let me explain...

1881
01:45:10.835 --> 01:45:12.127
Forget it...

1882
01:45:14.502 --> 01:45:17.752
- It's going to rain.
- What's taking so long?!


1883
01:45:17.918 --> 01:45:20.418
- Go and call everyone!
- Come on, come on!


1884
01:45:20.502 --> 01:45:22.252
Where's Arjun? Call him!

1885
01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:23.752
Where were you?

1886
01:45:27.835 --> 01:45:29.168
There you'll are!

1887
01:45:29.252 --> 01:45:31.168
- Everyone's calling you'll!
- Corning...


1888
01:45:31.377 --> 01:45:33.960
- Aunty! Come!

1889
01:45:34.335 --> 01:45:35.835
- Arjun's not answering
his bloody phone.


1890
01:45:35.918 --> 01:45:38.377
- It's started drizzling!
- Aunty, sit here!


1891
01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:39.418
Okay...

1892
01:45:40.252 --> 01:45:42.502
- Quickly now! Fast!

1893
01:45:48.127 --> 01:45:51.043
- Sit there, baby.

1894
01:45:51.210 --> 01:45:54.210
- Sit there or she won't be seen.
- No no no! Not you!


1895
01:45:54.377 --> 01:45:56.002
Sit now. Come on...

1896
01:45:57.127 --> 01:45:58.918
Rahul, closer to your Mum.

1897
01:45:59.793 --> 01:46:01.335
- Show some love, guys!

1898
01:46:01.502 --> 01:46:02.960
- Okay, everyone ready?

1899
01:46:03.085 --> 01:46:04.377
Wait, where's Arjun?

1900
01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:06.335
- Where's Arjun?
- Arjun?


1901
01:46:06.502 --> 01:46:09.168
There you are!
Did you forget about the picture?


1902
01:46:09.252 --> 01:46:11.085
- Come on, Arjun!

1903
01:46:11.252 --> 01:46:12.877
- We were worried you had
gone back to America.


1904
01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:14.293
There! Next to Rahul!

1905
01:46:15.043 --> 01:46:16.918
- Next to Rahul!
- Come on!


1906
01:46:17.210 --> 01:46:20.252
- Hurry up now, it'll rain...

1907
01:46:22.043 --> 01:46:23.793
- Where were you, Arjun?

1908
01:46:24.127 --> 01:46:27.043
What are you planning
with all that space?


1909
01:46:27.210 --> 01:46:29.543
- Come closer!

1910
01:46:30.293 --> 01:46:31.252
Okay!

1911
01:46:31.418 --> 01:46:32.668
Why is only Dadu smiling?

1912
01:46:32.793 --> 01:46:34.627
Happy family photo!

1913
01:46:36.377 --> 01:46:39.043
Uncle! Put your arm around aunty!

1914
01:46:39.127 --> 01:46:41.627
- Like she's your wife!
- They're acting like neighbors...


1915
01:46:41.710 --> 01:46:44.502
The neighbor's wife is way hotter.

1916
01:46:45.377 --> 01:46:46.960
Okay, focus!

1917
01:46:48.127 --> 01:46:49.252
What's wrong?

1918
01:46:49.418 --> 01:46:51.668
- Change the battery, you idiot!
- Oh, man...


1919
01:46:52.210 --> 01:46:54.127
- He's your friend, right?
- I want to go to the loo!


1920
01:46:54.252 --> 01:46:56.668
- No no!
- 2 minutes!


1921
01:46:56.835 --> 01:46:58.793
He should check the
battery beforehand...


1922
01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:01.627
- What are we waiting for?

1923
01:47:02.168 --> 01:47:03.793
Were you at Anu's?

1924
01:47:05.085 --> 01:47:06.960
We'll talk about this later...

1925
01:47:07.502 --> 01:47:08.585
- Camera ready!

1926
01:47:08.793 --> 01:47:11.377
- Where's Zoey?

1927
01:47:11.543 --> 01:47:12.543
What's wrong with you?

1928
01:47:12.668 --> 01:47:14.252
- Zoey, come back!
- Nothing.


1929
01:47:15.210 --> 01:47:16.418
Then why do you look so irritable?

1930
01:47:16.502 --> 01:47:18.335
Because you're the
scum of this earth.


1931
01:47:18.418 --> 01:47:20.418
- Okay, camera ready!

1932
01:47:23.210 --> 01:47:25.460
- Okay, ready! Smile!

1933
01:47:25.627 --> 01:47:26.960
Uncle, put your arm around Aunty!

1934
01:47:27.043 --> 01:47:29.960
- Come, come...
- Smile everyone!


1935
01:47:30.168 --> 01:47:31.127
-And...

1936
01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:33.460
Ready!

1937
01:47:34.043 --> 01:47:35.752
I've had enough.

1938
01:47:36.002 --> 01:47:37.418
- Sunita...
- Where's Aunty going?


1939
01:47:37.502 --> 01:47:39.710
- Sunita, I was joking!

1940
01:47:39.918 --> 01:47:42.043
I don't want any part
in this 'happy family' sham.


1941
01:47:42.127 --> 01:47:44.877
Everyone’s waiting!
I'll tell you everything! Please!


1942
01:47:46.752 --> 01:47:48.168
- Tell me one thing...

1943
01:47:48.418 --> 01:47:50.543
Were you or were you not at Anu's?

1944
01:47:52.293 --> 01:47:53.252
I was.

1945
01:47:54.543 --> 01:47:55.460
Sunita...

1946
01:47:56.543 --> 01:47:59.418
Sunita... listen.
I went to end it.


1947
01:47:59.835 --> 01:48:02.210
I'll never go back again.

1948
01:48:02.627 --> 01:48:04.877
When did all this start?

1949
01:48:05.793 --> 01:48:06.752
One year...

1950
01:48:06.918 --> 01:48:09.085
- One year?!
- How does it matter now?


1951
01:48:12.668 --> 01:48:13.835
Liars...

1952
01:48:14.127 --> 01:48:16.418
Both of you! Liars!

1953
01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:18.918
Happy now?

1954
01:48:19.085 --> 01:48:21.293
Satisfied? Isn't this what you wanted?

1955
01:48:21.418 --> 01:48:25.460
Why is he packing?! Stop packing!
Harsh! Harsh!


1956
01:48:25.710 --> 01:48:27.502
- They're all going...
- We can do it later!


1957
01:48:27.710 --> 01:48:29.085
- Let's do this tomorrow...
- Okay, tomorrow.


1958
01:48:29.168 --> 01:48:29.918
<i>
- Damn!</i>

1959
01:48:30.002 --> 01:48:32.168
Arjun... take the kids to a hotel.

1960
01:48:32.252 --> 01:48:33.752
What are you hiding this time?

1961
01:48:34.418 --> 01:48:36.668
- What are you talking about?
- Really?


1962
01:48:36.752 --> 01:48:38.418
I have no idea what
you're talking about!


1963
01:48:38.543 --> 01:48:40.335
So you didn't kiss Tia?

1964
01:48:42.877 --> 01:48:44.252
Why didn't you tell me?

1965
01:48:44.418 --> 01:48:45.293
Look, Arjun...

1966
01:48:45.418 --> 01:48:48.418
Frankly speaking,
I have no time for your love life.


1967
01:48:48.543 --> 01:48:50.710
If you think this is the
best time to talk about this...


1968
01:48:50.877 --> 01:48:53.460
- You can go sulk in some corner!
- Screw this photo!


1969
01:48:53.627 --> 01:48:56.085
- What happened?
- What's going on?


1970
01:48:56.335 --> 01:48:59.377
- Neetu, take the kids and go.
- Nothing's wrong, Dadu.


1971
01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:04.502
- Dad, you'll get wet!

1972
01:49:04.585 --> 01:49:06.793
Go. Please go to Anu's house.

1973
01:49:07.168 --> 01:49:08.210
That's what's best.

1974
01:49:09.085 --> 01:49:10.585
I'm apologizing to you.

1975
01:49:11.127 --> 01:49:13.168
I made a mistake.
I'm only human!


1976
01:49:13.502 --> 01:49:14.543
Sunita...

1977
01:49:26.460 --> 01:49:27.418
Dad!

1978
01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:29.043
Dad!

1979
01:49:50.210 --> 01:49:52.168
What's happening, Rahul?
ls everything okay?


1980
01:49:52.252 --> 01:49:53.793
Everything's fine, Uncle.
Please just handle everyone.


1981
01:49:53.877 --> 01:49:55.293
- Are you sure-
- Yes, I'm sure!


1982
01:49:55.377 --> 01:49:56.793
Please! I'll handle it.

1983
01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:58.418
- Ma...
- Neetu!


1984
01:49:59.377 --> 01:50:00.460
- Shashi!

1985
01:50:01.252 --> 01:50:02.918
- I'm coming, Dad!

1986
01:50:09.877 --> 01:50:11.335
I'll talk to him!

1987
01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:13.335
Dad... Everything's okay.

1988
01:50:13.418 --> 01:50:15.918
What nonsense!
They're all fighting outside!


1989
01:50:16.085 --> 01:50:17.627
I'm here to take care of it!

1990
01:50:24.335 --> 01:50:25.377
Ma...

1991
01:50:25.710 --> 01:50:28.168
I'm sorry for what I said before.

1992
01:50:29.377 --> 01:50:31.252
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

1993
01:50:31.335 --> 01:50:32.543
Go away, Rahul...

1994
01:50:34.835 --> 01:50:38.627
You lied to me... I don't
want to hear any more...


1995
01:50:39.293 --> 01:50:42.460
Ma... ls it the lies that hurt you...
or the truth?


1996
01:50:42.627 --> 01:50:45.543
You and I have no connection now.

1997
01:50:46.668 --> 01:50:48.752
You're no one to me.

1998
01:50:50.085 --> 01:50:52.085
Ma... Please... 
Just listen to me.

1999
01:50:52.293 --> 01:50:53.752
Please... <i>2</i> minutes...

2000
01:50:53.918 --> 01:50:55.793
I know I lied.

2001
01:50:56.335 --> 01:50:57.710
I kept a lot of secrets...

2002
01:50:57.793 --> 01:51:01.793
I hurt you and I can
apologize for it all...


2003
01:51:02.252 --> 01:51:05.293
But how do I apologize
for who I really am?


2004
01:51:06.168 --> 01:51:09.335
Rahul... my perfect son...

2005
01:51:09.543 --> 01:51:12.877
Morn, I'm tired of being perfect.

2006
01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:14.668
Please...

2007
01:51:16.043 --> 01:51:17.585
I don't want any of this...

2008
01:51:17.918 --> 01:51:21.252
I'm tired of running...
from myself... from you.


2009
01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:23.502
I'm tired of being afraid
of what people will say.


2010
01:51:24.418 --> 01:51:26.293
I am what I am, Ma...

2011
01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:29.377
and l just want you
to love me for who I am.


2012
01:51:32.210 --> 01:51:34.335
Where did I go so wrong...

2013
01:51:36.710 --> 01:51:40.377
- that everyone...
- you, Arjun, your father...


2014
01:51:40.585 --> 01:51:42.668
- everyone's pushed me away.

2015
01:51:43.127 --> 01:51:46.710
- God will never forgive me...
- Please, Ma...


2016
01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:49.960
Go away, Rahul!
You've really hurt me!


2017
01:52:15.210 --> 01:52:16.918
Whatever I am today,
is because of you.


2018
01:52:17.002 --> 01:52:19.502
My book, my career... it's all you.

2019
01:52:21.502 --> 01:52:23.377
I've done something terrible, Rahul...

2020
01:52:25.418 --> 01:52:26.502
Rahul...

2021
01:52:28.252 --> 01:52:30.377
- Your book...
- Rahul!


2022
01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:33.918
The story that-

2023
01:52:34.752 --> 01:52:35.793
- Bloody thief!

2024
01:52:37.543 --> 01:52:39.835
Stealing once wasn't enough for you?!

2025
01:52:40.043 --> 01:52:41.168
- Shashi!

2026
01:52:41.377 --> 01:52:42.210
- Shashi!

2027
01:52:42.835 --> 01:52:44.460
- Shashi come quick!

2028
01:52:46.418 --> 01:52:48.752
I was trying to help you...

2029
01:52:50.502 --> 01:52:51.335
- Liar!

2030
01:52:51.377 --> 01:52:53.043
Why do you think your agent's
been trying to get in touch?!


2031
01:52:53.127 --> 01:52:54.543
Ma, he was stealing again!
You know it!


2032
01:52:54.627 --> 01:52:56.752
No! No!
It's not his fault!


2033
01:52:56.835 --> 01:52:59.335
I was the one
who gave him your story!

2034
01:53:27.210 --> 01:53:31.460
Rahul had been trying
to write for ages...


2035
01:53:32.835 --> 01:53:35.168
- He was stuck...
- What about me, Ma?!


2036
01:53:35.335 --> 01:53:39.710
Arjun... I thought you weren't
serious about anything...


2037
01:53:40.710 --> 01:53:42.460
You quit college in 6 months...

2038
01:53:43.127 --> 01:53:46.460
Then adventure sports, photography...

2039
01:53:47.293 --> 01:53:48.710
You had abandoned that book too?
Hadn't you?


2040
01:53:48.793 --> 01:53:50.960
So you gave my story to Rahul!

2041
01:53:51.043 --> 01:53:52.210
I just thought...

2042
01:53:52.293 --> 01:53:55.752
Thought what, Ma?!
Like you ever think about me!


2043
01:53:56.793 --> 01:53:59.627
Do you know why I'm always
taking up new things?!


2044
01:54:00.335 --> 01:54:02.293
I wanted to prove myself!

2045
01:54:02.377 --> 01:54:05.502
I wanted to do something
to make you feel proud!


2046
01:54:06.127 --> 01:54:08.585
And today,
you've snatched that from me!


2047
01:54:09.085 --> 01:54:10.210
I'm sorry...

2048
01:54:11.543 --> 01:54:13.668
I should never have
given him your story...


2049
01:54:13.835 --> 01:54:17.293
Morn, this isn't about
the goddamn story!


2050
01:54:17.627 --> 01:54:20.377
It's about you and me!! It's about what
you made me feel all these years...


2051
01:54:20.418 --> 01:54:22.085
that I'm just not good enough.

2052
01:54:22.252 --> 01:54:23.377
No, my darling...

2053
01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:25.127
Rahul was always better than me!

2054
01:54:25.377 --> 01:54:27.960
- I'm sorry...
- Sorry?!


2055
01:54:29.293 --> 01:54:32.293
Sorry won't fix this, Ma...
Sorry won't fix anything.


2056
01:54:32.377 --> 01:54:33.627
Arjun, no!

2057
01:54:33.710 --> 01:54:35.793
Arjun! Listen, please!

2058
01:58:36.377 --> 01:58:39.002
Arjun sir... Your bags are packed.

2059
01:58:39.168 --> 01:58:41.502
The taxi will be here at 5 am.

2060
01:58:46.543 --> 01:58:48.377
I'm not hungry...

2061
01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:51.502
You'll eat...

2062
01:58:56.918 --> 01:58:58.293
Arjun, please...

2063
01:59:00.168 --> 01:59:02.002
Stay back a few days...

2064
01:59:03.752 --> 01:59:05.710
Morn needs us.

2065
01:59:07.793 --> 01:59:10.710
She doesn't need us... she needs you.

2066
01:59:17.793 --> 01:59:20.002
She's not even speaking to me.

2067
01:59:24.210 --> 01:59:25.918
Who knows if she ever will.

2068
01:59:26.168 --> 01:59:30.585
Please, Rahul... There's nothing
you can do to make Morn that angry.


2069
01:59:34.835 --> 01:59:36.127
If only.

2070
01:59:40.293 --> 01:59:44.752
Arjun... There's something
I've been lying about my entire life.


2071
01:59:46.627 --> 01:59:48.877
I don't have a girlfriend in London.

2072
01:59:54.710 --> 01:59:59.377
As for Tia... or Geet...
or any girl for that matter...


2073
01:59:59.585 --> 02:00:02.793
I've never been interested...

2074
02:00:03.960 --> 02:00:05.502
and never will be.

2075
02:00:09.752 --> 02:00:13.418
My whole life has been a lie... and...

2076
02:00:15.835 --> 02:00:19.293
No one in this house
will ever accept the truth.


2077
02:00:27.877 --> 02:00:29.918
I... I don't know what to say.

2078
02:00:31.918 --> 02:00:33.293
It's alright.

2079
02:00:33.627 --> 02:00:35.668
You don't have to say anything.

2080
02:00:38.710 --> 02:00:42.752
All I'm asking is that
you stay back for a while.


2081
02:00:48.835 --> 02:00:50.460
That's something I can't do!

2082
02:00:56.252 --> 02:00:58.168
I... I need some time.

2083
02:01:28.627 --> 02:01:29.960
- So has he read the new draft?

2084
02:01:30.127 --> 02:01:32.002
He's been expecting you!

2085
02:01:35.502 --> 02:01:36.585
Thank you.

2086
02:01:36.918 --> 02:01:38.543
- Hey, Arjun... Edward.
- Hi.


2087
02:01:38.668 --> 02:01:39.752
Have a seat.

2088
02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:42.418
So. Loved the new draft.

2089
02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:45.877
Congratulations.
We're going ahead with it.


2090
02:01:48.293 --> 02:01:49.252
Thank you.

2091
02:01:50.418 --> 02:01:52.127
The new ending's great!

2092
02:01:52.293 --> 02:01:54.210
What made you decide to change it?

2093
02:01:56.835 --> 02:01:58.960
Just a good suggestion from someone.

2094
02:03:02.168 --> 02:03:03.460
Hello, kids...

2095
02:03:03.543 --> 02:03:04.752
How are you?

2096
02:03:05.043 --> 02:03:06.293
- I'm fine.

2097
02:03:07.002 --> 02:03:08.835
It's just that...

2098
02:03:09.627 --> 02:03:13.418
I got tired of watching
Mandakini's videos.


2099
02:03:13.543 --> 02:03:15.877
So I thought I'd talk to you guys...

2100
02:03:18.377 --> 02:03:20.710
I really miss you both.

2101
02:03:22.293 --> 02:03:24.043
After Harsh...

2102
02:03:25.085 --> 02:03:27.210
- It's difficult to
find the will to live.


2103
02:03:28.627 --> 02:03:31.877
Otherwise I was all
set for my century...


2104
02:03:32.877 --> 02:03:34.877
Now it's too hard...

2105
02:03:35.627 --> 02:03:37.627
I feel very alone...

2106
02:03:39.293 --> 02:03:42.085
Sometimes I look at
your father's pictures and...


2107
02:03:54.585 --> 02:03:58.335
You'll should call
your mother sometimes...


2108
02:03:58.877 --> 02:04:03.793
She acts like she's very strong...

2109
02:04:05.127 --> 02:04:08.835
But I hear her crying every night.

2110
02:04:10.085 --> 02:04:11.502
- Every night.

2111
02:04:12.627 --> 02:04:18.418
I'm asking you'll for
the one thing I don't have...


2112
02:04:19.418 --> 02:04:21.918
Just a little... Time.

2113
02:04:23.210 --> 02:04:25.627
Everyone makes mistakes, kids...

2114
02:04:26.418 --> 02:04:29.252
- But we don't abandon our families.

2115
02:04:30.793 --> 02:04:32.668
Consider this an old man's request...

2116
02:04:32.752 --> 02:04:36.543
Once... just once... Come back.

2117
02:04:37.085 --> 02:04:40.960
After that... who knows
if you'll need to.


2118
02:04:44.502 --> 02:04:45.335
<i>Bye-bye...</i>

2119
02:05:10.835 --> 02:05:12.043
- Hi Shashi Uncle...

2120
02:05:12.293 --> 02:05:13.460
Hi Zoey!

2121
02:05:13.668 --> 02:05:14.668
- Flight was okay?
- Hi...


2122
02:05:14.752 --> 02:05:16.752
- How are you?
- Good, good...


2123
02:05:27.918 --> 02:05:29.293
Come with me!

2124
02:05:29.502 --> 02:05:31.543
- See my new book!
- Hi, Ma.


2125
02:05:38.793 --> 02:05:40.085
Thank you...

2126
02:05:40.668 --> 02:05:42.085
Thank you for coming...

2127
02:05:42.460 --> 02:05:44.960
- Hi, Dadu...
- I'm so happy to see you'll...


2128
02:05:46.127 --> 02:05:49.168
- You rest, Dadu...
- We'll see you in the morning.


2129
02:05:49.377 --> 02:05:51.335
Do me a favor...

2130
02:05:52.627 --> 02:05:54.960
Another small request...

2131
02:05:55.502 --> 02:05:59.918
Bring the whole family to me tomorrow...

2132
02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:06.752
God bless you both...

2133
02:06:16.002 --> 02:06:17.127
Rahul?

2134
02:06:17.377 --> 02:06:18.627
Come in, Ma...

2135
02:06:19.502 --> 02:06:21.252
Just dropping these off...

2136
02:06:22.668 --> 02:06:24.960
Dharmendra forgot to keep them...

2137
02:06:35.377 --> 02:06:36.418
I'll get you a glass...

2138
02:06:36.502 --> 02:06:37.960
- Ma?
- Yes?


2139
02:06:40.668 --> 02:06:41.752
Sit with me...

2140
02:06:59.835 --> 02:07:01.168
How are you?

2141
02:07:02.377 --> 02:07:03.668
I'm fine...

2142
02:07:05.168 --> 02:07:06.252
Busy“.

2143
02:07:07.918 --> 02:07:09.002
I'm fine.

2144
02:07:13.918 --> 02:07:15.002
Are you okay?

2145
02:07:15.085 --> 02:07:17.418
Yes... I'm fine.

2146
02:07:19.668 --> 02:07:21.752
And... How's...

2147
02:07:26.668 --> 02:07:29.460
Your... friend?

2148
02:07:42.418 --> 02:07:43.585
It's okay.

2149
02:07:45.335 --> 02:07:47.043
I missed you.

2150
02:07:47.752 --> 02:07:49.043
I'm sorry.

2151
02:07:56.585 --> 02:07:58.210
I didn't think you'd come.

2152
02:07:59.418 --> 02:08:01.168
I didn't think you'd call.

2153
02:08:05.293 --> 02:08:09.293
You know, Tia... When you
told me about your family...


2154
02:08:12.252 --> 02:08:14.293
I could understand your pain...

2155
02:08:17.335 --> 02:08:18.877
But now... I can feel it.

2156
02:08:20.293 --> 02:08:21.752
I know how you feel, Arjun.

2157
02:08:31.752 --> 02:08:34.252
I'm tired of running away...
that's all I've ever done.


2158
02:08:34.585 --> 02:08:35.835
Then come back...

2159
02:08:38.210 --> 02:08:39.877
Everyone’s here...

2160
02:08:40.585 --> 02:08:42.043
They always were.

2161
02:08:47.835 --> 02:08:49.168
I missed you.
