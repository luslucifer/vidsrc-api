00:02:50.668 --> 00:02:51.960
Any resemblance to reality

3
00:04:10.206 --> 00:04:12.248
Leontine, what is it?

4
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.418
Look, it's Jesus!

5
00:04:15.544 --> 00:04:17.253
Where are they going?

6
00:04:18.631 --> 00:04:20.799
They're coming down!

7
00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:49.703
Where are you taking
that statue?


8
00:04:53.708 --> 00:04:55.208
What?

9
00:04:56.502 --> 00:04:58.336
Where are you taking it?

10
00:05:04.343 --> 00:05:06.344
They're taking it to the pope.

11
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:12.934
- He wants our phone number.
- No!


12
00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:11.993
Hey, kid.
Come here a minute.


13
00:06:13.412 --> 00:06:16.247
What did table 16 have to eat?

14
00:06:16.457 --> 00:06:18.625
The prince had snails.

15
00:06:19.043 --> 00:06:21.294
- And to drink?
- Soave.


16
00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:23.838
No, I saw them myself.

17
00:06:23.964 --> 00:06:26.174
The prince had
a bottle of Valpolicella.


18
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.343
Hi, Marcello.
- Hi, Pierone.


19
00:06:28.636 --> 00:06:32.013
Snails and Valpolicella.
Giulio, let me take a picture.


20
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:34.098
No chance, my friend.

21
00:06:34.225 --> 00:06:38.228
Why pay him when I'll tell you
anything you want to know?


22
00:06:57.706 --> 00:07:01.668
Manager,
bring that photographer here!


23
00:07:04.255 --> 00:07:07.090
Give me the film.
- There's no film in it!


24
00:07:07.258 --> 00:07:10.301
Everyone has a right
to their image.


25
00:07:11.595 --> 00:07:13.596
May I have a light?

26
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.902
- Come here a minute, sweetheart.
- Me?


27
00:07:28.028 --> 00:07:31.447
Yes, you.
I want to have a word.


28
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.703
Good evening. How are you?

29
00:07:37.746 --> 00:07:39.664
Well?
- Have a seat.


30
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.541
There's no chair.

31
00:07:41.667 --> 00:07:43.293
Squat down.

32
00:07:43.794 --> 00:07:45.169
Pardon me.

33
00:07:45.296 --> 00:07:46.921
Naughty boy.

34
00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:50.258
- Why?
- Because you're a naughty boy.


35
00:07:50.634 --> 00:07:53.636
And I'm going
to smash your face in.


36
00:07:55.014 --> 00:07:59.767
My job is to inform the public.
Besides, a little publicity...


37
00:07:59.894 --> 00:08:03.563
Your publicity got her
in trouble with her husband.


38
00:08:03.731 --> 00:08:06.900
Do I get involved
in your women and affairs?


39
00:08:07.026 --> 00:08:08.443
You're not a journalist.

40
00:08:08.777 --> 00:08:11.779
- Some journalism!
- Be quiet.


41
00:08:12.364 --> 00:08:15.783
Watch your step, Marcello.
- So kill me.


42
00:08:27.755 --> 00:08:30.256
- Has he arrived?
- Not yet.


43
00:08:30.424 --> 00:08:33.051
When he does,
tell him he's an idiot.


44
00:08:33.302 --> 00:08:35.094
Give me a whiskey.

45
00:08:36.931 --> 00:08:40.516
This dump should be shut down.
It's unbearable.


46
00:09:26.814 --> 00:09:29.399
Good evening, Maddalena.
You all alone?


47
00:09:29.984 --> 00:09:32.110
Care to dance?
- No.


48
00:09:34.113 --> 00:09:35.905
How about a vodka?

49
00:09:36.198 --> 00:09:39.617
No, everything's going wrong tonight.
I'm leaving.


50
00:09:39.785 --> 00:09:42.578
- May I accompany you?
- Why not?


51
00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:12.316
- Your friends are ready to attack.
- Where are you two going?


52
00:10:12.985 --> 00:10:15.737
- Miss Maddalena.
- Leave me alone tonight.


53
00:10:15.904 --> 00:10:19.657
Welcome back.
Lovelier than a movie star.


54
00:10:19.825 --> 00:10:23.244
It's the same every night.
Don't they ever give up?


55
00:10:23.412 --> 00:10:25.246
Paparazzo, that's enough.

56
00:10:25.414 --> 00:10:28.708
You should be used to it.
You're a public figure.


57
00:10:28.917 --> 00:10:32.170
Marcello,
where are you taking her?


58
00:10:45.809 --> 00:10:48.978
I'd like to live in a new city,
never run into anyone.


59
00:10:49.104 --> 00:10:50.897
I really like Rome.

60
00:10:51.023 --> 00:10:54.275
It's like a peaceful jungle.

61
00:10:54.401 --> 00:10:56.319
It's easy to hide in.

62
00:10:59.073 --> 00:11:02.408
I wish I could hide too,
but I can't.


63
00:11:06.747 --> 00:11:10.166
What do we do now?
- Go for a ride? Stay here?


64
00:11:16.757 --> 00:11:20.134
I'm fed up with Rome.
I'd like an island.


65
00:11:20.302 --> 00:11:23.387
- So buy one.
- I've thought about it.


66
00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:27.517
But would I even go?

67
00:11:28.769 --> 00:11:31.479
Your problem is
you have too much money.


68
00:11:32.272 --> 00:11:35.024
And yours is
you don't have enough.


69
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:39.278
Meanwhile, here we are.

70
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:44.909
It's not so bad.
So few of us unhappy people remain.


71
00:11:45.327 --> 00:11:47.954
What happened to your cheek?
- Nothing.


72
00:11:48.372 --> 00:11:50.039
Don't worry.

73
00:11:50.207 --> 00:11:53.042
You're so rich,
you'll always land on your feet.


74
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.211
- Think so?
- Sure.


75
00:11:55.712 --> 00:11:58.506
I can't even stand
on my own two feet.


76
00:11:59.007 --> 00:12:02.677
I'd need some sort of vitality
that I just don't have.


77
00:12:03.428 --> 00:12:07.348
But when I make love,
then I come alive.


78
00:12:07.474 --> 00:12:09.725
Only love gives me strength.

79
00:12:09.893 --> 00:12:11.102
Long live love!

80
00:12:12.563 --> 00:12:14.897
Annamaria, come look!

81
00:12:15.357 --> 00:12:17.733
That car's
the size of an apartment!


82
00:12:17.943 --> 00:12:21.571
- Is that Liliana?
- I'm not Liliana.


83
00:12:21.989 --> 00:12:24.866
And who are you?
- Good evening.


84
00:12:25.242 --> 00:12:28.119
- Good evening.
- Who are you talking to?


85
00:12:29.121 --> 00:12:30.705
Who's there?

86
00:12:30.998 --> 00:12:34.250
Liliana moved to Milan.

87
00:12:34.668 --> 00:12:36.711
Want to come for a drive?

88
00:12:36.837 --> 00:12:38.838
- Me?
- Yes.


89
00:12:40.132 --> 00:12:41.591
Come on.

90
00:12:42.634 --> 00:12:47.013
This lady wants me to go for a drive.
Should I?


91
00:12:48.682 --> 00:12:50.892
Let's go for a drive
with this woman.


92
00:12:51.435 --> 00:12:53.603
What do you want to do?

93
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:57.398
Nothing. Go for a drive
and then take her home.


94
00:12:57.733 --> 00:12:59.692
You know her?
- No.


95
00:13:01.278 --> 00:13:03.279
At least I don't think so.

96
00:13:04.323 --> 00:13:06.949
I'm gonna go eat.
I'll wait for you there.


97
00:13:07.117 --> 00:13:10.912
Here they come.
- Turn those lights off!


98
00:13:13.957 --> 00:13:17.293
Soak 'em for it.
They're richer than Onassis.


99
00:13:20.005 --> 00:13:21.505
Are you coming?

100
00:13:21.632 --> 00:13:25.301
If I'm not imposing,
I'd love a ride home.


101
00:13:25.636 --> 00:13:27.470
You coming?

102
00:13:28.055 --> 00:13:29.472
Nope.

103
00:13:29.765 --> 00:13:32.141
But I live kinda far away.

104
00:13:33.852 --> 00:13:37.271
- Climb in back. Can you make it?
- Yes, thanks.


105
00:13:38.565 --> 00:13:40.274
- You all right?
- Yes.


106
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.568
- Bye, Ninnì.
- Bye, Annamaria.


107
00:13:42.694 --> 00:13:45.696
- Where do you live?
- In Cessati Spiriti.


108
00:13:56.708 --> 00:13:59.669
- Is this your car?
- Yes.


109
00:14:00.796 --> 00:14:04.090
- Did you buy it for her?
- Her father did.


110
00:14:04.258 --> 00:14:07.593
All my father gave me
were beatings!


111
00:14:08.011 --> 00:14:11.472
- Do you know my father?
- You introduced us once.


112
00:14:12.182 --> 00:14:16.102
- Where do your parents live again?
- In Cesena.


113
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.229
- Is that by the sea?
- No.


114
00:14:20.065 --> 00:14:22.066
So how are things going?

115
00:14:22.651 --> 00:14:24.694
What can I say?

116
00:14:26.738 --> 00:14:28.739
Didn't things go well tonight?

117
00:14:28.907 --> 00:14:32.660
One heel gave me

118
00:14:33.996 --> 00:14:35.913
Was he young or old?

119
00:14:36.039 --> 00:14:38.457
I didn't look at his face!

120
00:14:43.547 --> 00:14:45.756
Would you go
with a woman like her?


121
00:14:46.133 --> 00:14:48.259
- No.
- Why not?


122
00:14:49.177 --> 00:14:51.470
She's no worse than lots of others.

123
00:14:51.722 --> 00:14:55.391
Or don't you go with women like her?
- Sure, sometimes.


124
00:14:57.519 --> 00:15:01.731
Listen, Gregory Peck,
you mind clueing me in?


125
00:15:01.857 --> 00:15:03.607
What are we doing?

126
00:15:03.734 --> 00:15:06.736
- Didn't you want a ride home?
- Yes.


127
00:15:07.029 --> 00:15:09.113
So we're taking you home.

128
00:15:10.073 --> 00:15:12.241
Why? What did you think?

129
00:15:12.367 --> 00:15:15.036
Nothing.
What should I think?


130
00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:28.215
We'll wake everyone up.
Turn off the radio.


131
00:15:28.383 --> 00:15:32.136
- We're leaving right away, right?
- Is anybody at home?


132
00:15:32.262 --> 00:15:35.222
- What's she saying?
- Is anybody home?


133
00:15:35.557 --> 00:15:38.851
Like who?
My cousin's in Velletri...


134
00:15:39.019 --> 00:15:41.729
So will you invite us in for coffee?

135
00:15:42.773 --> 00:15:45.274
Be glad to.
I make good coffee.


136
00:15:52.324 --> 00:15:55.201
Don't expect a palace.

137
00:15:56.161 --> 00:15:57.870
I'll lead the way.

138
00:16:27.609 --> 00:16:29.068
The coffee.

139
00:16:33.156 --> 00:16:36.992
Watch out for the stairs.
The other evening a man...


140
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.287
What a mess!
It's flooded again.


141
00:16:40.414 --> 00:16:43.707
This is no way to live,
goddamn it!


142
00:16:44.042 --> 00:16:45.751
Wait a moment.

143
00:16:46.002 --> 00:16:50.172
Some engineer!
He should've been a grave digger!


144
00:16:50.424 --> 00:16:56.053
I could pay off all the sins
of the devil before this gets fixed.


145
00:16:57.055 --> 00:16:58.722
Ah, crap!

146
00:17:02.185 --> 00:17:04.687
I'll show you into the bedroom.

147
00:17:05.147 --> 00:17:06.856
Dear God.

148
00:17:07.524 --> 00:17:11.652
It's flooded too. Make yourselves
at home while I make coffee.


149
00:17:11.778 --> 00:17:14.905
You need friends
in high places these days.


150
00:17:15.073 --> 00:17:19.201
I'm sorry. I put in a request
two years ago, but...


151
00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:20.953
Don't worry about it.

152
00:17:22.456 --> 00:17:25.458
I'll put the coffee on, all right?

153
00:17:35.051 --> 00:17:36.844
Would you close the door?

154
00:17:54.613 --> 00:17:56.614
You want to make love here?

155
00:17:58.241 --> 00:17:59.533
No?

156
00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.063
I'll leave your coffee out here.

157
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.156
You didn't talk business first?
You crazy?


158
00:18:39.282 --> 00:18:41.742
They didn't even need me!

159
00:18:41.868 --> 00:18:44.954
Should I have kicked 'em out?
Maybe I'll get 2,000 lira.


160
00:18:45.413 --> 00:18:48.249
Listen, I set the prices here!

161
00:18:48.542 --> 00:18:50.125
Are they married?

162
00:18:50.293 --> 00:18:51.919
Yeah, right!

163
00:19:26.329 --> 00:19:28.163
Here. Many thanks.

164
00:19:28.331 --> 00:19:30.749
Do I need to back up?

165
00:19:30.875 --> 00:19:35.337
No, you can turn right at the end.
Can I give you a kiss?


166
00:19:35.505 --> 00:19:39.174
Thanks, and come back
whenever you want.


167
00:19:39.301 --> 00:19:42.344
- Bye.
- Don't drive too fast!


168
00:20:07.162 --> 00:20:09.705
Oh, God!

169
00:20:41.738 --> 00:20:43.113
Emma!

170
00:20:47.369 --> 00:20:49.870
Emma, what is it?
Answer me.


171
00:20:49.996 --> 00:20:51.664
What's happened?

172
00:20:59.089 --> 00:21:00.881
What did you do?

173
00:21:01.007 --> 00:21:03.050
You crazy fool!

174
00:21:20.485 --> 00:21:23.654
It's nothing. Keep calm.

175
00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.823
I'll drive you myself.

176
00:21:25.949 --> 00:21:28.617
Why are you so crazy?

177
00:21:29.953 --> 00:21:32.329
You want to ruin me?

178
00:21:32.539 --> 00:21:34.957
One day I'll just let you die.

179
00:21:35.125 --> 00:21:37.000
I'll let you die.

180
00:21:39.462 --> 00:21:43.090
Emma, answer me.
That's enough now.


181
00:21:52.726 --> 00:21:55.144
Emma, darling.

182
00:21:56.271 --> 00:21:57.980
My love.

183
00:22:04.446 --> 00:22:05.904
Hurry!

184
00:22:17.125 --> 00:22:20.419
Rubini, did you bring
that woman in?


185
00:22:20.545 --> 00:22:23.547
Giannelli,
please don't write about this.


186
00:22:23.673 --> 00:22:25.883
I don't need trouble
with the police.


187
00:22:26.009 --> 00:22:28.886
What happened?
What's her name?


188
00:22:29.053 --> 00:22:32.306
I can't tell you.
Please, leave me alone.


189
00:22:32.557 --> 00:22:34.141
You can come in.

190
00:22:48.239 --> 00:22:50.574
Don't tire her out.
She needs to rest.


191
00:22:53.411 --> 00:22:55.370
She can go home in a few hours.

192
00:22:55.497 --> 00:22:58.791
You'll have to make a police report.
It's obligatory.


193
00:23:08.968 --> 00:23:11.804
Emma, why did you do it?

194
00:23:12.764 --> 00:23:14.681
Tell me why.

195
00:23:26.402 --> 00:23:28.570
The officer is waiting for you.

196
00:23:33.159 --> 00:23:34.952
I'll be right back.

197
00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.382
Wait there, please.
He'll be right with you.


198
00:24:01.312 --> 00:24:04.731
- Sister, may I use the phone?
- Certainly.


199
00:24:58.369 --> 00:25:02.080
- Get down.
- I just want one picture!


200
00:25:46.876 --> 00:25:48.543
Take off your glasses.

201
00:26:27.625 --> 00:26:30.293
Producer Totò Scalise
has just arrived.


202
00:26:30.461 --> 00:26:34.381
He's signed the star
for a major film role.


203
00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:36.883
Is that the Swedish woman?

204
00:26:37.051 --> 00:26:40.512
Don't let me see her
or I might kill my wife!


205
00:26:40.638 --> 00:26:42.097
Long live Sweden!

206
00:26:42.598 --> 00:26:48.020
The beautiful Swedish actress
is now tasting some food.


207
00:26:48.312 --> 00:26:50.605
A typical Italian dish,

208
00:26:50.773 --> 00:26:55.402
as colorful and fragrant
as our wonderful country.


209
00:26:55.737 --> 00:26:58.697
Hi, Marcello.
Nice piece of meat, huh?


210
00:26:58.865 --> 00:27:02.117
Totò Scalise is now leading
the star toward customs...


211
00:27:31.105 --> 00:27:34.399
- Was it a good flight?
- Yes, thank you.


212
00:27:34.567 --> 00:27:36.443
What a commotion!

213
00:27:53.544 --> 00:27:56.880
- Marcello, pass him!
- Hold your horses!


214
00:27:57.048 --> 00:28:00.509
I want to get a picture.
Run him over!


215
00:28:09.143 --> 00:28:12.312
Is it true you take an ice bath
every morning?


216
00:28:27.411 --> 00:28:30.497
What historical Italian figure
would you like to play?


217
00:28:31.457 --> 00:28:33.542
Do you like men with beards?

218
00:28:38.965 --> 00:28:41.925
What do you think
of Italian actresses?


219
00:29:10.163 --> 00:29:14.207
Do you think Italian neorealism
is dead or alive?


220
00:29:15.084 --> 00:29:17.419
Do you believe
in friendship among peoples?


221
00:29:40.109 --> 00:29:43.778
No, I didn't have
a chance to call earlier.


222
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.493
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm working!


223
00:29:50.661 --> 00:29:52.454
Did you take your medicine?

224
00:29:52.788 --> 00:29:54.414
Are you alone with her?

225
00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.334
There are
at least 50 people here!


226
00:29:58.544 --> 00:30:01.463
Swear on your mother's life!
Swear it!


227
00:30:01.631 --> 00:30:03.757
I swear on my mother.

228
00:30:06.135 --> 00:30:09.888
Beautiful?
Sure, if you like American beauty.


229
00:30:10.014 --> 00:30:12.974
She's like a big doll.

230
00:30:41.462 --> 00:30:44.130
I'll come over there
and rip your eyes out!


231
00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.301
Marcello, why don't you
come here now?


232
00:30:48.511 --> 00:30:50.136
I can't.

233
00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.055
I want to make love.

234
00:30:52.181 --> 00:30:54.307
- What?
- I want to make love!


235
00:30:57.395 --> 00:31:02.065
- Where should we take her?
- To St. Peter's and the Quirinale.


236
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.817
Not a bad idea.

237
00:31:07.613 --> 00:31:09.447
Here's our Robert.

238
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:23.712
- Marcello?
- What do you want?


239
00:31:23.879 --> 00:31:26.715
Are you going out?
- No, I'll wait for you here.


240
00:31:26.882 --> 00:31:28.883
I'll stay home all day.

241
00:31:29.552 --> 00:31:32.679
What do you want to eat?
Something light?


242
00:31:32.888 --> 00:31:35.223
I'll make you some ravioli.

243
00:31:35.891 --> 00:31:39.561
I've got everything.
I'll just go down for vegetables.


244
00:31:39.895 --> 00:31:42.981
Then we'll go to the movies.
Whatever you want.


245
00:31:43.399 --> 00:31:45.692
Marcello, do you love me?

246
00:32:07.715 --> 00:32:09.549
Don't leave her alone!

247
00:32:42.583 --> 00:32:44.834
Stop, I'll take one more.

248
00:32:48.672 --> 00:32:50.507
She doesn't stop for a second.

249
00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:09.275
I've finished these rolls.
I'll get more from the car.


250
00:33:16.992 --> 00:33:20.370
- Where did she go?
- She's like an elevator!


251
00:35:10.606 --> 00:35:14.943
You're everything, Sylvia.
You know that?


252
00:35:18.822 --> 00:35:22.534
The first woman
on the first day of creation.


253
00:35:23.285 --> 00:35:26.454
You're mother, sister,
lover, friend,


254
00:35:26.747 --> 00:35:29.624
angel, devil, earth, home.

255
00:35:29.792 --> 00:35:32.794
That's what you are: home.

256
00:35:38.842 --> 00:35:41.427
Why did you come here?

257
00:35:42.096 --> 00:35:44.472
Go back to America, please.

258
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.141
What will I do now?

259
00:36:03.492 --> 00:36:06.619
Our Robert is a painter too.
Bravo!


260
00:36:07.538 --> 00:36:10.206
I absolutely must see you
and talk to you.


261
00:36:30.853 --> 00:36:34.856
- Who is that idiot?
- Frankie Stout, a divine actor.


262
00:37:06.513 --> 00:37:08.056
Please.

263
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:31.704
- Will you excuse me a moment?
- Go on, sweetheart.


264
00:37:33.415 --> 00:37:35.750
He's dancing with the lady.

265
00:39:10.012 --> 00:39:11.679
Hi, darling.

266
00:39:21.732 --> 00:39:23.608
He's a good dancer.

267
00:39:24.026 --> 00:39:25.943
Really great.

268
00:39:27.362 --> 00:39:29.655
Are you making a banana flambé?

269
00:39:29.907 --> 00:39:32.867
- The lady's shoes.
- Give them here.


270
00:39:33.035 --> 00:39:36.037
- I found them on...
- That's fine, thank you.


271
00:39:36.205 --> 00:39:39.207
Excuse me. One moment.

272
00:40:04.066 --> 00:40:05.650
What do you want?

273
00:42:27.542 --> 00:42:31.170
Bravo, Frankie!
You were wonderful!


274
00:42:34.132 --> 00:42:35.883
You were wonderful!

275
00:42:38.971 --> 00:42:41.931
What class, madame!
What style!


276
00:42:42.224 --> 00:42:44.934
That was dangerous but beautiful!

277
00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.811
Thank you, sir.

278
00:42:50.399 --> 00:42:52.775
Marcello,
give me the champagne.


279
00:43:44.828 --> 00:43:48.664
I'll bring her back immediately.

280
00:43:48.832 --> 00:43:51.417
Give me the shoes.
I'll be right back.


281
00:43:51.626 --> 00:43:54.670
- Why's she so upset?
- Stay here. I'll handle it.


282
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:57.173
Here she is!

283
00:43:58.258 --> 00:44:00.092
Sylvia, your shoes.

284
00:44:00.343 --> 00:44:02.845
- Marcello, what happened?
- Nothing. Go away.


285
00:44:07.934 --> 00:44:09.852
Great idea, Marcello.

286
00:44:17.652 --> 00:44:20.446
Paparazzo, get out!

287
00:44:20.572 --> 00:44:23.824
It'll be a worldwide scoop.
I'll give you 50 percent.


288
00:44:23.992 --> 00:44:27.161
Screw your 50 percent!
Beat it!


289
00:44:31.583 --> 00:44:34.877
Get lost!
- Where are you going?


290
00:44:36.546 --> 00:44:39.006
Hurry, follow them!

291
00:44:59.027 --> 00:45:01.028
We've lost them.

292
00:45:08.578 --> 00:45:10.621
Yes... of course.

293
00:46:19.774 --> 00:46:21.400
What is it?

294
00:46:48.845 --> 00:46:50.971
It's full of holes there.

295
00:47:09.324 --> 00:47:11.325
We'd better go now.

296
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:24.338
Sergio will be back on the 12th.
This is his mother.


297
00:47:24.506 --> 00:47:28.634
- Do you have the key to his place?
- No, he takes it with him.


298
00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.303
I'm his mother.
Is this about work?


299
00:47:31.805 --> 00:47:34.682
Yes, it's about work.

300
00:47:36.559 --> 00:47:39.478
I'll call on the 12th.
It doesn't matter.


301
00:47:39.646 --> 00:47:41.897
Sorry, ma'am. Good night.

302
00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:48.362
Excuse me, isn't that
the American actress?


303
00:47:48.571 --> 00:47:49.655
Yes.

304
00:47:49.823 --> 00:47:51.824
- She's so beautiful!
- Good night.


305
00:48:02.377 --> 00:48:06.547
I can't take you to my place.
That crazy woman's there.


306
00:48:06.715 --> 00:48:09.883
She wouldn't understand.
- Un-der-stand?


307
00:48:11.177 --> 00:48:13.595
Wait, I have an idea.

308
00:48:16.599 --> 00:48:19.393
Miss, a phone call for you.

309
00:48:22.564 --> 00:48:26.567
Marcello! Sure you don't have
the wrong number?


310
00:48:27.068 --> 00:48:29.820
Maddalena, may I bring
someone there?


311
00:48:30.071 --> 00:48:33.365
- "Someone"?
- Who calls at this hour?


312
00:48:33.992 --> 00:48:38.620
Just someone.
You're not alone?


313
00:48:39.414 --> 00:48:42.041
I'm playing cards with my father.

314
00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:45.878
Ah, your father's there.

315
00:48:46.254 --> 00:48:47.796
Tell me...

316
00:48:49.257 --> 00:48:50.924
what is it you want?

317
00:48:51.634 --> 00:48:54.928
Nothing. I'll call you soon.
Good night.


318
00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:12.404
Sylvia, what are you doing?

319
00:49:21.748 --> 00:49:24.750
Where would I find milk
at this hour?


320
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:30.130
Sylvia, come on.

321
00:49:30.298 --> 00:49:34.134
Where are you taking that cat?
Rome is full of cats. If we start...


322
00:49:34.302 --> 00:49:35.677
Stop.

323
00:49:36.304 --> 00:49:37.805
Come on.

324
00:49:38.473 --> 00:49:42.309
You'll never find milk.
Wait in the car. I'll go.


325
00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.479
I'll go.

326
00:49:46.481 --> 00:49:47.815
Go on.

327
00:49:56.825 --> 00:49:59.660
Excuse me,
where can I buy some milk?


328
00:50:00.703 --> 00:50:02.454
Okay, never mind.

329
00:51:38.635 --> 00:51:41.303
Yes, Sylvia, I'm coming too.

330
00:51:42.388 --> 00:51:43.889
I'm coming too.

331
00:51:48.728 --> 00:51:51.730
She's right.
I've had it all wrong.


332
00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.316
We've all had it wrong.

333
00:52:08.039 --> 00:52:10.207
Sylvia, who are you?

334
00:52:47.495 --> 00:52:49.162
Turn his head.

335
00:52:54.002 --> 00:52:56.461
To think this guy played Tarzan.

336
00:52:56.588 --> 00:52:58.463
Turn his head back.

337
00:53:04.304 --> 00:53:06.888
I'll get an over-the-mirror shot.

338
00:53:07.515 --> 00:53:10.392
And I'll get one of you
taking his picture.


339
00:53:12.645 --> 00:53:14.354
Here's Marcello!

340
00:53:17.859 --> 00:53:19.818
Boys, don't start now.

341
00:53:20.028 --> 00:53:21.320
Wake up!

342
00:53:30.121 --> 00:53:32.998
Marcello, give us all the details.

343
00:53:33.625 --> 00:53:37.294
- Do me a favor and go away.
- I have to work!


344
00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:39.046
Enough!

345
00:53:40.048 --> 00:53:43.216
Marcello,
why are your clothes all wet?


346
00:53:43.384 --> 00:53:44.885
I don't know!

347
00:53:50.808 --> 00:53:53.226
There's gonna be a fight.

348
00:54:19.837 --> 00:54:21.505
Follow her, Mr. Robert!

349
00:54:23.591 --> 00:54:25.592
This isn't over yet.

350
00:54:29.597 --> 00:54:32.933
- Here he is, Marcello.
- Hit him first.


351
00:54:47.281 --> 00:54:49.783
Marcello, raise your head a bit.

352
00:54:49.951 --> 00:54:52.035
He's walking away!
Mr. Robert!


353
00:55:00.128 --> 00:55:02.462
Marcello, that's done.
What now?


354
00:55:03.506 --> 00:55:06.633
Put the horse on the table
and her on the ground.


355
00:55:13.725 --> 00:55:15.142
I'll be right back.

356
00:55:15.268 --> 00:55:18.437
So can I pick you up
at 8:00 tonight?


357
00:55:18.563 --> 00:55:20.480
You're so vain!

358
00:55:20.648 --> 00:55:23.358
I'm not vain. I'm working.

359
00:55:36.289 --> 00:55:37.789
Steiner!

360
00:55:39.083 --> 00:55:42.043
I thought I saw you come in here.
How are you?


361
00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:46.006
What are you doing here?
- It's so good to see you again.


362
00:55:48.509 --> 00:55:51.011
This is like my second home.

363
00:55:51.846 --> 00:55:56.892
Father Franz finally found this book
I've been looking for forever.


364
00:55:57.059 --> 00:55:59.644
An old Sanskrit grammar.

365
00:56:01.522 --> 00:56:05.358
It's been so long!
How's your book going?


366
00:56:05.902 --> 00:56:09.654
Oh... it's coming along.
I've finished gathering material.


367
00:56:09.822 --> 00:56:12.407
I thought I'd ask you to read it.

368
00:56:12.533 --> 00:56:15.160
And you?
- I read your last article.


369
00:56:15.328 --> 00:56:17.537
I liked it very much.

370
00:56:19.207 --> 00:56:22.000
Why? It was very good.

371
00:56:23.169 --> 00:56:28.548
It was clear and passionate...
your best qualities.


372
00:56:28.716 --> 00:56:31.885
The ones you insist
on trying to hide.


373
00:56:32.094 --> 00:56:34.846
I don't think
I even know how to write.


374
00:56:34.972 --> 00:56:38.725
I live nearby. Why don't you
come by some evening?


375
00:56:40.144 --> 00:56:43.522
Can you stay five more minutes?
- Of course.


376
00:56:45.858 --> 00:56:48.777
- Father, may I bring a friend up?
- Certainly.


377
00:56:49.028 --> 00:56:52.113
- We're not disturbing you?
- Not at all.


378
00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:56.827
As you see,
these priests don't fear the devil.


379
00:56:57.995 --> 00:57:00.455
They even let me play the organ.

380
00:57:01.916 --> 00:57:04.417
Just don't make a racket, okay?

381
00:57:04.544 --> 00:57:07.587
Don't worry.
Maybe some jazz, that's all.


382
00:57:07.755 --> 00:57:11.591
Couldn't we close the church?
- Jazz is fine by me.


383
00:57:13.928 --> 00:57:16.847
Sorry, I won't do that again.

384
00:57:17.765 --> 00:57:20.225
You want to try?

385
00:57:27.191 --> 00:57:29.734
Sounds we're no longer
used to hearing.


386
00:57:30.653 --> 00:57:34.573
Like a mysterious voice
from deep within the earth.


387
00:57:35.032 --> 00:57:38.034
What do you want to hear?
- You choose.


388
00:58:55.237 --> 00:58:58.406
Where did they say it was?

389
00:58:58.532 --> 00:59:03.328
Hey, Paparazzo!
- They said at the 47th kilometer.


390
00:59:06.582 --> 00:59:09.417
I don't want an egg right now!

391
00:59:09.585 --> 00:59:11.252
I don't want it!
- Eat.


392
00:59:13.756 --> 00:59:15.590
And chew slowly.

393
00:59:15.967 --> 00:59:20.762
We should have come yesterday.
It'll be full of photographers.


394
00:59:21.389 --> 00:59:23.932
Is there any coffee left?

395
00:59:24.058 --> 00:59:26.559
The little that's left
is for Marcello.


396
00:59:27.395 --> 00:59:29.396
I don't want a banana!

397
00:59:30.022 --> 00:59:32.941
I don't want it!
- Eat it.


398
00:59:36.153 --> 00:59:38.029
And chew slowly.

399
00:59:47.081 --> 00:59:50.083
- The Madonna's children?
- Yes.


400
00:59:50.418 --> 00:59:55.130
- Where's the field of miracles?
- That way.


401
01:00:14.608 --> 01:00:17.444
You'd better wait here.
There's too much commotion.


402
01:00:21.449 --> 01:00:23.700
Norman.

403
01:00:24.326 --> 01:00:25.994
Don't go anywhere.

404
01:00:30.958 --> 01:00:33.585
Norman, where are the kids?

405
01:00:33.753 --> 01:00:36.254
Locked up in the police station.

406
01:00:36.756 --> 01:00:40.133
Take me with you.
I'll tell you what the communists did.


407
01:00:40.301 --> 01:00:43.178
- Is that the miracle tree?
- Down at the end.


408
01:00:46.348 --> 01:00:49.309
Damn the police!
Damn the police!


409
01:01:01.155 --> 01:01:05.909
You have no right
to detain those children!


410
01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.162
- Everyone's upstairs.
- Let's go in.


411
01:01:14.001 --> 01:01:15.502
Come on!

412
01:01:18.923 --> 01:01:20.799
Which way?
- In there.


413
01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:24.177
- Ma'am, where are the children?
- I don't know.


414
01:01:24.345 --> 01:01:26.638
- And the sergeant?
- Who knows?


415
01:01:32.394 --> 01:01:35.688
What about the 500 lira
the reporter gave you?


416
01:01:35.815 --> 01:01:40.360
- The father and mother!
- Can I go home, inspector?


417
01:01:43.656 --> 01:01:46.950
My back hurts, and I'm cold.

418
01:01:47.076 --> 01:01:49.536
Yes, it's like winter here.

419
01:01:52.915 --> 01:01:55.458
Look over there.

420
01:01:55.584 --> 01:01:57.627
That's good.

421
01:02:01.382 --> 01:02:05.385
- Now stand here.
- The grandfather's here too!


422
01:02:05.553 --> 01:02:08.847
You must be a very happy mother.
What are their names?


423
01:02:09.014 --> 01:02:11.057
Dario and Maria.

424
01:02:11.183 --> 01:02:13.977
Great names.
That's right, cry!


425
01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:18.398
It's a miracle.
The Madonna remembers everyone.


426
01:02:18.774 --> 01:02:21.484
Is this good?
- Perfect!


427
01:02:23.028 --> 01:02:25.405
- A cigar.
- Sing first.


428
01:02:30.077 --> 01:02:33.037
- So it's not a miracle?
- I don't believe so.


429
01:02:33.205 --> 01:02:35.665
The Lord can perform
miracles anywhere,


430
01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:37.917
often among the most destitute,

431
01:02:38.085 --> 01:02:40.712
but they're very rare events.
- Couldn't this be one?


432
01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.089
No, those children are lying.

433
01:02:43.257 --> 01:02:48.344
Seeing the Madonna changes a person.
They don't try to profit from it.


434
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:52.765
Miracles occur
in prayer and silence,


435
01:02:52.933 --> 01:02:54.684
not in all this hubbub!

436
01:02:55.144 --> 01:02:59.272
On your way to school,
whom did you see beside the tree?


437
01:02:59.398 --> 01:03:02.233
- The Madonna.
- Who saw her first?


438
01:03:02.359 --> 01:03:03.484
- Me!
- Me!


439
01:03:03.652 --> 01:03:05.445
At the same time?

440
01:03:05.571 --> 01:03:07.530
No, he saw her first.

441
01:03:07.656 --> 01:03:09.991
- Then what happened?
- I'm their uncle.


442
01:03:10.117 --> 01:03:13.494
We knelt down,
and the Madonna smiled at us.


443
01:03:13.621 --> 01:03:16.122
Her feet didn't even touch
the ground.


444
01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:18.917
How did you know
it was the Madonna?


445
01:03:19.418 --> 01:03:22.086
They don't want to believe it.

446
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:25.131
You mean you think
it really was her?


447
01:03:25.299 --> 01:03:27.342
It doesn't matter if it was or not.

448
01:03:28.302 --> 01:03:31.763
What do you mean?
Why do you say that?


449
01:03:31.889 --> 01:03:33.806
It doesn't matter.

450
01:03:33.974 --> 01:03:37.060
Your country
is a land of ancient beliefs,


451
01:03:37.186 --> 01:03:39.437
filled with supernatural forces,

452
01:03:39.563 --> 01:03:41.981
so everyone feels their influence.

453
01:03:42.107 --> 01:03:45.568
Besides, he who looks for God
finds him wherever he wants.


454
01:03:45.694 --> 01:03:47.695
Did you come for a miracle too?

455
01:03:48.113 --> 01:03:50.490
No, I'm here with my fiancé.

456
01:03:50.658 --> 01:03:53.326
He's a journalist on assignment.

457
01:03:54.453 --> 01:03:59.082
All these people and all this shouting
frighten me a little.


458
01:03:59.458 --> 01:04:04.003
Stand there. Don't look
at the camera, and don't laugh.


459
01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:07.131
Higher. Keep going.

460
01:04:07.508 --> 01:04:11.135
No, I was wrong.
Come down.


461
01:04:11.595 --> 01:04:14.013
Let's work out
how to frame the children.


462
01:04:14.139 --> 01:04:16.683
Remember: Children are short.

463
01:04:16.850 --> 01:04:19.519
Am I in the shot?

464
01:04:19.687 --> 01:04:22.522
Come on, everyone.
Quickly!


465
01:04:22.982 --> 01:04:24.524
Hurry, please!

466
01:04:25.359 --> 01:04:28.569
- There's my fiancé.
- Yes, go join him.


467
01:04:28.696 --> 01:04:30.613
Excuse me a moment.

468
01:04:31.532 --> 01:04:33.491
Ready? Action!

469
01:04:34.118 --> 01:04:39.038
Louder!
All of you have to pray!


470
01:04:43.210 --> 01:04:46.879
It's 7:00 now.
We'll start again in two hours.


471
01:04:47.089 --> 01:04:50.341
Get something to eat.
See you tonight.


472
01:04:50.509 --> 01:04:52.093
Enjoy your dinner!

473
01:05:03.355 --> 01:05:07.775
Holy Madonna,
please heal my little girl.


474
01:05:08.068 --> 01:05:11.612
Grant me this miracle.
I ask you with all my soul.


475
01:05:25.085 --> 01:05:27.045
Don't worry, my darling.

476
01:05:27.171 --> 01:05:30.465
The Madonna hears us.
She is good.


477
01:06:04.124 --> 01:06:08.920
A huge crowd has gathered
in this remote and deserted region.


478
01:06:09.296 --> 01:06:12.173
Many are believers.
Others are just curious.


479
01:06:12.341 --> 01:06:15.510
Among the latter
are reporters and photographers


480
01:06:15.761 --> 01:06:18.763
from newspapers
from all over the world.


481
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:22.266
An endless line of cars
has been arriving.


482
01:06:22.559 --> 01:06:27.397
It's humid, but the sky is clear
after all the rain.


483
01:06:27.523 --> 01:06:30.650
The two children
are still in police custody,


484
01:06:30.859 --> 01:06:33.820
with no further word
from Rome regarding them.


485
01:06:33.987 --> 01:06:37.490
Let's speak
to the children's uncle now.


486
01:06:37.783 --> 01:06:41.744
When did they first see the...

487
01:06:42.663 --> 01:06:44.455
the miracle?

488
01:06:44.706 --> 01:06:48.918
My niece and nephew first saw
the holy image of the Madonna


489
01:06:49.044 --> 01:06:50.837
on March 15 of...

490
01:06:52.214 --> 01:06:53.673
next year.

491
01:06:53.841 --> 01:06:56.175
- You mean this year.
- This year.


492
01:06:56.844 --> 01:07:01.180
They're releasing the children.
Permission came from Rome.


493
01:07:01.348 --> 01:07:03.558
They're coming!
They've released them!


494
01:07:05.561 --> 01:07:09.230
You stay here. Good evening.
I'll be right back.


495
01:07:09.398 --> 01:07:11.566
- Where are you going?
- Up there.


496
01:07:11.692 --> 01:07:15.695
- I'll come with you.
- No, stay here with the lady.


497
01:07:20.617 --> 01:07:22.118
Wait here.

498
01:07:37.050 --> 01:07:38.968
Marcello, come down!

499
01:07:39.386 --> 01:07:41.846
I just got up here! Relax!

500
01:07:46.143 --> 01:07:48.561
Shall I come up too?

501
01:08:07.247 --> 01:08:10.791
Marcello,
why have you changed so much?


502
01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:14.420
Why don't you love me anymore?

503
01:08:18.926 --> 01:08:21.928
Dear Madonna,
if he'd only marry me,


504
01:08:22.095 --> 01:08:25.806
I'd come here on foot
every day to thank you.


505
01:08:26.266 --> 01:08:28.601
But I don't even ask for that much.

506
01:08:28.769 --> 01:08:32.355
Just that he be mine again,
like he was once.


507
01:08:32.481 --> 01:08:35.024
Here they come!

508
01:08:35.943 --> 01:08:37.360
Here they come.

509
01:08:37.486 --> 01:08:41.113
When they get to the tree,
start filming.


510
01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:19.652
Wait till I signal you
with my handkerchief.


511
01:09:20.112 --> 01:09:24.115
How are you, sweetie?
Focus on them with the crowd behind.


512
01:09:24.241 --> 01:09:26.325
It's dark back here!

513
01:09:36.044 --> 01:09:38.379
My wife's down there too.

514
01:09:40.048 --> 01:09:43.426
Sometimes she makes me so mad,
and then other times...


515
01:09:47.889 --> 01:09:50.391
Heal me!

516
01:09:59.192 --> 01:10:01.444
Stay calm.

517
01:10:02.863 --> 01:10:04.989
One at a time.

518
01:10:11.121 --> 01:10:13.706
- It's gonna rain.
- That's dangerous.


519
01:10:22.090 --> 01:10:26.135
The lights will short-circuit!
Shut everything off!


520
01:10:27.054 --> 01:10:30.139
Turn off all generators!

521
01:10:45.614 --> 01:10:50.368
We've taken shelter in the bus
because the rain's started up again.


522
01:11:06.718 --> 01:11:08.761
The Madonna's over there!

523
01:11:24.695 --> 01:11:27.613
The children are getting up again

524
01:11:27.906 --> 01:11:30.449
and running the other way.

525
01:11:30.617 --> 01:11:32.952
They're shouting
that they see the Madonna.


526
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.454
The crowd's going wild
and following them.


527
01:11:50.429 --> 01:11:54.849
Once again
they're running to a different spot.


528
01:12:12.325 --> 01:12:14.201
There she is!

529
01:12:27.549 --> 01:12:32.344
Let me through!
They'll catch pneumonia in this rain!


530
01:12:39.811 --> 01:12:43.022
Quiet! The Madonna said
to build a church here


531
01:12:43.148 --> 01:12:45.191
or she won't appear anymore.

532
01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:47.276
Good night! Go home!

533
01:14:00.392 --> 01:14:02.142
Let me go!

534
01:14:03.311 --> 01:14:06.605
- Paparazzo, stop it!
- It's a great shot.


535
01:14:06.773 --> 01:14:11.193
Let me go!
How dare you act like that!


536
01:14:11.444 --> 01:14:14.780
You're worse than hyenas!

537
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:17.616
You have no respect for anyone!

538
01:14:29.963 --> 01:14:33.632
What are you crying for?
Where'd you leave it?


539
01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:36.302
I don't remember!

540
01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:46.270
He's dead!

541
01:14:50.150 --> 01:14:51.817
He's dead!

542
01:15:35.487 --> 01:15:38.030
Good evening.
I'm Steiner's wife.


543
01:15:38.198 --> 01:15:40.324
We've been expecting you.

544
01:15:55.382 --> 01:15:57.591
Good evening, Marcello.
How are you?


545
01:15:57.759 --> 01:15:59.885
Fine. What a lovely home!

546
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:04.348
This must be Emma.
I've been wanting to meet you.


547
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:07.726
Thank you for coming.
- Excuse me.


548
01:16:08.019 --> 01:16:09.436
Come here.

549
01:16:10.021 --> 01:16:12.940
- Anna, how are you?
- Did you finish your book?


550
01:16:13.066 --> 01:16:15.901
You must know Margherita's work?
- Of course.


551
01:16:16.069 --> 01:16:19.071
And you didn't even come
to my exhibition!


552
01:16:19.572 --> 01:16:24.952
She loves your writing,
but she doesn't speak any Italian.


553
01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:28.580
She did say you're very handsome.
- She's right.


554
01:16:31.084 --> 01:16:33.877
Odd as it sounds,
I feel I know you well.


555
01:16:34.713 --> 01:16:38.757
The day you realize you love Marcello
more than he loves himself...


556
01:16:40.635 --> 01:16:42.720
you'll be happy.

557
01:16:47.392 --> 01:16:51.270
I've always said:
The only real women are from the Orient.


558
01:16:51.688 --> 01:16:55.441
After all, where was Eve?
In the Garden of Eden.


559
01:16:55.775 --> 01:16:58.777
Where was the Garden of Eden?
In the Orient.


560
01:16:58.945 --> 01:17:02.781
There love is...
- So why did you marry me?


561
01:17:02.949 --> 01:17:05.034
I made a big mistake!

562
01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:07.578
Mysterious, maternal...

563
01:17:07.704 --> 01:17:09.663
lover and daughter in one.

564
01:17:09.789 --> 01:17:12.750
She huddles at your feet

565
01:17:12.876 --> 01:17:14.877
like a love-struck little tiger.

566
01:17:15.003 --> 01:17:19.381
Why doesn't he just go
and live there?


567
01:17:19.507 --> 01:17:21.925
Will you introduce me to Emma?
- Of course.


568
01:17:22.302 --> 01:17:27.097
What a lovely face!
Listen, hold on tight to this guy.


569
01:17:27.265 --> 01:17:30.934
For his sake, I mean.

570
01:17:31.061 --> 01:17:34.772
The Oriental woman submits
both in spirit


571
01:17:34.898 --> 01:17:36.398
and flesh.

572
01:17:36.524 --> 01:17:40.986
May I introduce Marcello
and his fiancée, Emma?


573
01:17:41.154 --> 01:17:44.323
Pleased to meet you.
I agree with your concept of women.


574
01:17:44.949 --> 01:17:48.660
The Oriental woman
has much to teach us,


575
01:17:48.787 --> 01:17:50.788
because she has remained
close to nature,


576
01:17:50.955 --> 01:17:54.083
a nature conquered
after centuries of civilization.


577
01:17:54.501 --> 01:17:58.337
What use is civilization to you?
- What's it to you?


578
01:17:58.505 --> 01:18:01.548
You don't know
how to make love anymore.


579
01:18:01.716 --> 01:18:03.884
Speak for yourself.

580
01:18:04.219 --> 01:18:05.844
- Something to drink?
- Yes, please.


581
01:18:06.012 --> 01:18:08.013
I'm jealous of you.

582
01:18:08.139 --> 01:18:11.183
I've read all your stories
from around the world.


583
01:18:11.351 --> 01:18:14.353
I'd like to travel too

584
01:18:14.479 --> 01:18:17.356
and meet women of all races.

585
01:18:17.524 --> 01:18:21.068
I'd like to have children
of every color: red, yellow.


586
01:18:21.236 --> 01:18:25.197
Like a bouquet of flowers.
- Is that all you can say?


587
01:18:25.365 --> 01:18:28.158
You must have incredible memories.

588
01:18:28.284 --> 01:18:31.161
At my age,
memories aren't enough.


589
01:18:31.287 --> 01:18:33.372
I have plans!

590
01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:36.583
What a splendid creature!
Are you his fiancée?


591
01:18:36.751 --> 01:18:39.044
- Yes.
- You must be from the south.


592
01:18:39.379 --> 01:18:41.380
What an extraordinary character.

593
01:18:41.548 --> 01:18:44.341
He's written dozens
of important books,


594
01:18:44.634 --> 01:18:47.261
yet he's maintained
a childlike candor.


595
01:18:47.387 --> 01:18:50.681
I wonder how he can be
so optimistic.


596
01:18:51.599 --> 01:18:54.768
I always watch him
with amazement.


597
01:18:55.061 --> 01:18:57.980
Sometimes I wonder if I envy him.

598
01:18:58.106 --> 01:19:01.567
I see you have
a beautiful Morandi.


599
01:19:01.901 --> 01:19:04.778
Yes, he's my favorite painter.

600
01:19:05.029 --> 01:19:07.739
His subjects are immersed
in a dreamlike light,


601
01:19:07.907 --> 01:19:12.035
yet painted with such detachment,
precision, and rigor


602
01:19:12.745 --> 01:19:14.997
that you could almost touch them.

603
01:19:15.123 --> 01:19:18.625
It's an art
where nothing is coincidental.


604
01:19:18.751 --> 01:19:21.587
Steiner says you have two loves,

605
01:19:21.754 --> 01:19:24.089
and you don't know which to choose:

606
01:19:24.424 --> 01:19:26.717
journalism or literature.

607
01:19:26.843 --> 01:19:29.011
Beware of prisons!

608
01:19:29.137 --> 01:19:32.097
Remain free, available.
Like me.


609
01:19:33.099 --> 01:19:36.643
Never marry anything.
Never choose.


610
01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:39.605
Even in love,
it's better to be chosen.


611
01:19:44.027 --> 01:19:47.154
I read your poems
when I thought of writing poetry.


612
01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.406
I like them.
They're powerful, precise.


613
01:19:49.657 --> 01:19:51.450
It's not like a woman's writing.

614
01:19:51.618 --> 01:19:54.119
What would you know
about women?


615
01:19:54.704 --> 01:19:58.457
I prefer that type of art.
We'll need it in the future.


616
01:19:58.666 --> 01:20:01.668
Art that's clear
and free of rhetoric,


617
01:20:01.794 --> 01:20:04.796
that doesn't lie or flatter.

618
01:20:05.381 --> 01:20:09.968
I don't like the work I do now,
but I often think about tomorrow.


619
01:20:10.178 --> 01:20:14.890
We must all think of tomorrow
but without forgetting to live today.


620
01:20:15.058 --> 01:20:20.687
I believe if we live
with an intense fullness of spirit,


621
01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:23.065
every moment counts
as a whole year,


622
01:20:23.191 --> 01:20:26.026
and every year
we get five years younger!


623
01:20:30.114 --> 01:20:32.866
Iris, you're a prophet tonight.

624
01:20:32.992 --> 01:20:35.661
An alcoholic prophet!

625
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:40.832
My friends, you think
too much about the future.


626
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.044
But you seem so different.

627
01:20:44.170 --> 01:20:45.671
What do you do?

628
01:20:45.797 --> 01:20:49.007
I mean,
what do you like to do most?


629
01:20:50.301 --> 01:20:52.552
I don't know. You?

630
01:20:53.221 --> 01:20:56.556
I like the three great escapes:

631
01:20:56.683 --> 01:20:59.726
smoking, drinking, and bed.

632
01:20:59.978 --> 01:21:01.979
So this is your wisdom?

633
01:21:02.105 --> 01:21:04.690
You read my work
but understand nothing.


634
01:21:05.275 --> 01:21:07.526
You're the true primitive,

635
01:21:07.694 --> 01:21:10.362
primitive like a gothic spire.

636
01:21:10.530 --> 01:21:15.659
You're so tall that no voices
can reach you up there.


637
01:21:15.785 --> 01:21:18.203
Really? If you could see
my real height,


638
01:21:18.371 --> 01:21:20.747
you'd see I'm no taller than this.

639
01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:32.884
...primitive like a gothic spire.

640
01:21:33.052 --> 01:21:37.848
You're so tall that no voices
can reach you up there.


641
01:21:38.016 --> 01:21:40.851
Really? If you could see
my real height,


642
01:21:40.977 --> 01:21:43.520
you'd see I'm no taller than this.

643
01:21:48.234 --> 01:21:51.987
This is an old recording.
I'll turn it off.


644
01:21:52.238 --> 01:21:55.073
What is it?
Why can't we hear it?


645
01:21:55.450 --> 01:21:58.618
I don't want to bore you.
They're just meaningless sounds.


646
01:21:58.745 --> 01:22:01.496
They're nature sounds he recorded.

647
01:22:01.622 --> 01:22:05.042
Please tell him to play it.
Please.


648
01:22:05.543 --> 01:22:08.587
Why record them
if they're of no interest?


649
01:22:08.755 --> 01:22:10.797
I thought they were beautiful.

650
01:22:10.923 --> 01:22:12.841
You really want to hear them?
- Yes!


651
01:22:12.967 --> 01:22:15.302
I've heard them.
They're very stimulating.


652
01:22:15.595 --> 01:22:17.095
As you wish.

653
01:22:42.955 --> 01:22:44.623
Birds.

654
01:22:47.377 --> 01:22:49.586
That's exactly how they sound.

655
01:22:56.469 --> 01:22:57.761
A forest.

656
01:23:09.107 --> 01:23:11.775
What are you two doing here?

657
01:23:12.276 --> 01:23:15.278
Why are you out of bed?
- Excuse me.


658
01:23:15.696 --> 01:23:18.865
You'll catch cold
in those bare feet!


659
01:23:19.158 --> 01:23:21.451
Your storm woke him up.

660
01:23:25.123 --> 01:23:29.167
- Did you want one more kiss?
- Daddy bighead!


661
01:23:29.335 --> 01:23:31.670
Daddy bighead!
How dare you!


662
01:23:31.838 --> 01:23:34.923
Now everyone knows.
Daddy has a big head.


663
01:23:35.258 --> 01:23:37.342
What lovely children!

664
01:23:38.344 --> 01:23:41.721
He has such intelligent eyes!
- It's true.


665
01:23:42.181 --> 01:23:45.684
If he hears something interesting,
first he thinks about it


666
01:23:45.852 --> 01:23:50.188
with a serious little face,
and then he laughs cheerfully.


667
01:23:51.357 --> 01:23:54.985
If you give him a flower,
first he examines it,


668
01:23:55.194 --> 01:23:58.321
and then he laughs
because he understands it's beautiful.


669
01:23:58.489 --> 01:24:01.741
The same way you smile
when you listen to nice music.


670
01:24:02.618 --> 01:24:05.454
Now back to sleep.

671
01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:08.206
I'll come say good night again.

672
01:24:08.499 --> 01:24:10.584
Say good night to everyone.

673
01:24:12.003 --> 01:24:14.921
The girl is completely different.

674
01:24:15.047 --> 01:24:17.883
She loves combinations of words.

675
01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:20.343
A new phrase enchants her.

676
01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:24.514
Sometimes she invents them herself.
I've written down a few.


677
01:24:24.682 --> 01:24:26.183
For example...

678
01:24:26.893 --> 01:24:29.102
"Who is the mother of the sun?"

679
01:24:30.605 --> 01:24:32.439
It's really beautiful.

680
01:24:32.565 --> 01:24:34.649
The words of a poet.

681
01:24:35.651 --> 01:24:40.197
- Do they sleep with you?
- They'd like to, but they're not allowed.


682
01:24:40.948 --> 01:24:44.326
But sometimes
the little one sneaks into our room


683
01:24:44.452 --> 01:24:48.288
and slips into our bed
between the two of us.


684
01:24:48.414 --> 01:24:51.875
He takes one of my fingers
and squeezes it tightly.


685
01:24:52.293 --> 01:24:55.545
You can't imagine
how sweet it is to fall asleep


686
01:24:55.922 --> 01:24:58.298
with a little child next to you.

687
01:25:10.061 --> 01:25:12.771
Have you known Steiner long?

688
01:25:13.105 --> 01:25:16.608
Yes, but we've only seen
each other a few times.


689
01:25:16.776 --> 01:25:18.276
But...

690
01:25:39.298 --> 01:25:43.802
Marcello, you'll have a home
like this one day too.


691
01:25:52.687 --> 01:25:55.105
We make a good pair.

692
01:25:55.273 --> 01:25:57.357
We're made for each other.

693
01:26:23.551 --> 01:26:28.054
- You have to invite me more often.
- Anytime you like.


694
01:26:28.806 --> 01:26:30.682
What is it, Marcello?

695
01:26:31.684 --> 01:26:35.770
I need a change of scene.
I need to change a lot of things.


696
01:26:38.024 --> 01:26:40.025
Your home is a refuge.

697
01:26:40.192 --> 01:26:43.862
Your children, your wife, your books,
your extraordinary friends.


698
01:26:44.447 --> 01:26:47.699
I'm wasting my life.
I'm not going anywhere.


699
01:26:47.867 --> 01:26:50.243
I had ambitions once.

700
01:26:50.369 --> 01:26:54.289
Maybe I'm losing everything,
forgetting all that.


701
01:26:54.749 --> 01:26:58.835
The answer isn't being locked up
at home. Don't do what I've done.


702
01:27:00.296 --> 01:27:02.964
I'm too serious to be an amateur,

703
01:27:03.090 --> 01:27:05.967
but not serious enough
to be a professional.


704
01:27:07.303 --> 01:27:10.680
The most miserable life is better,
believe me,


705
01:27:11.015 --> 01:27:14.392
than an existence
protected by a society


706
01:27:14.810 --> 01:27:19.356
where everything's organized
and planned for and perfect.


707
01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:25.987
I can only be a friend,
so I can't give you any advice.


708
01:27:26.656 --> 01:27:28.573
But if you like,

709
01:27:28.741 --> 01:27:32.994
I could introduce you to a publisher
who'd give you a decent job


710
01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:36.039
and a chance to focus
on your real interests.


711
01:27:36.457 --> 01:27:40.251
Better than writing
for those semifascist rags, right?


712
01:27:40.586 --> 01:27:43.630
Want to think about it
and discuss it later?


713
01:27:44.131 --> 01:27:45.382
Yes.

714
01:27:51.972 --> 01:27:53.556
Come with me.

715
01:29:04.170 --> 01:29:06.171
Sometimes at night...

716
01:29:07.131 --> 01:29:10.008
the darkness and silence
weigh on me.


717
01:29:11.552 --> 01:29:13.928
It's peace that frightens me.

718
01:29:14.221 --> 01:29:16.681
I fear peace
more than anything else.


719
01:29:16.849 --> 01:29:19.517
It seems to me it's just a facade

720
01:29:19.643 --> 01:29:22.187
with hell hiding behind it.

721
01:29:22.855 --> 01:29:26.149
I think of what my children
will see in the future.


722
01:29:26.567 --> 01:29:29.277
"It will be a wonderful world,"
they say.


723
01:29:29.403 --> 01:29:34.324
But how, when a phone call
can end it all?


724
01:29:35.576 --> 01:29:39.287
One should live
beyond passion and emotion,


725
01:29:39.413 --> 01:29:42.665
in the harmony found
in perfect works of art,


726
01:29:43.167 --> 01:29:45.543
in that enchanted order.

727
01:29:47.213 --> 01:29:50.048
We should learn
to love one another,


728
01:29:50.674 --> 01:29:54.135
to live outside of time,
detached.


729
01:29:57.431 --> 01:29:59.224
Detached.

730
01:30:08.025 --> 01:30:11.194
I can't spend my life calling you!

731
01:30:12.404 --> 01:30:15.907
I want to work in peace!
I don't know!


732
01:30:16.033 --> 01:30:18.827
Could you please
turn off that jukebox?


733
01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:25.083
No, I won't tell you where I am!
Go to hell!


734
01:30:25.292 --> 01:30:27.335
Crazy idiot!

735
01:30:47.731 --> 01:30:50.191
You think I could have some quiet?

736
01:30:51.777 --> 01:30:55.154
- This one's broken, Paola.
- Get another one.


737
01:30:55.489 --> 01:30:59.701
Are you eating here?
- No... yes... I don't know.


738
01:31:00.286 --> 01:31:02.495
The food's good, you know.

739
01:31:08.043 --> 01:31:10.503
Is it hard to learn to type?

740
01:31:11.463 --> 01:31:14.632
- You want to be a typist?
- I'd love to.


741
01:31:15.175 --> 01:31:18.928
- You're very pretty, you know?
- Oh, don't exaggerate.


742
01:31:19.847 --> 01:31:22.473
You know very well you're pretty.

743
01:31:22.641 --> 01:31:25.643
- Yeah, sure.
- This is broken.


744
01:31:25.811 --> 01:31:28.813
You're not from Rome.
Where are you from?


745
01:31:29.273 --> 01:31:33.151
- Umbria, near Perugia.
- How'd you end up here?


746
01:31:33.485 --> 01:31:35.987
My father's working in Anzio,
so I came here.


747
01:31:36.155 --> 01:31:40.116
But after Christmas
I'm moving to Ostia or Rome.


748
01:31:41.035 --> 01:31:43.953
- Who's he, your brother?
- He's my helper.


749
01:31:44.079 --> 01:31:46.497
They treat you well here!

750
01:31:46.665 --> 01:31:50.209
Yes... but I don't like it much.

751
01:31:50.544 --> 01:31:52.462
I can't wait to go home.

752
01:31:52.796 --> 01:31:56.174
Sunday I saw a car
with a Perugia license plate,


753
01:31:56.342 --> 01:31:59.052
and I felt so homesick I nearly cried.

754
01:32:01.889 --> 01:32:05.892
- Show me your profile.
- Why?


755
01:32:06.018 --> 01:32:07.936
Just for a second.

756
01:32:08.479 --> 01:32:12.565
You look like a little angel
from an Umbrian church.


757
01:32:13.025 --> 01:32:16.945
You've heard that before, huh?
Why are you laughing?


758
01:32:17.279 --> 01:32:18.655
No reason.

759
01:32:20.282 --> 01:32:24.535
- You have a boyfriend?
- Yeah, right.


760
01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:32.877
You're not writing anymore?

761
01:32:35.506 --> 01:32:38.549
Can I turn the music back on?
- Sure.


762
01:32:40.135 --> 01:32:43.012
You throwing away
this piece of paper too?


763
01:33:23.721 --> 01:33:25.013
What do you want?

764
01:33:30.936 --> 01:33:34.147
- Marcello, your father's here.
- My father?


765
01:33:34.314 --> 01:33:36.774
A guy over there
says he's your father.


766
01:33:36.942 --> 01:33:38.609
Stop joking around.

767
01:33:38.777 --> 01:33:43.573
He's eating over there.
He's been waiting for two hours.


768
01:33:43.699 --> 01:33:46.075
Didn't he say he was his father?

769
01:33:48.787 --> 01:33:52.623
He's sitting over there.
- Where?


770
01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:54.584
Next to the black guy.

771
01:34:07.431 --> 01:34:08.598
Dad.

772
01:34:14.146 --> 01:34:15.605
Finally!

773
01:34:16.148 --> 01:34:18.691
I arrived in Rome this morning.

774
01:34:18.817 --> 01:34:21.694
I looked for you at your place
and at the newspaper.


775
01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:25.615
I was about to leave
when your friend said to wait here.


776
01:34:25.741 --> 01:34:27.533
That's Paparazzo.

777
01:34:27.659 --> 01:34:32.080
I'm out and about all day for work.
I only go home to sleep.


778
01:34:32.206 --> 01:34:33.790
Why are you in Rome?

779
01:34:33.957 --> 01:34:37.668
To grease a few palms
at the ministry.


780
01:34:37.836 --> 01:34:41.005
They can cover up anything.
You look well.


781
01:34:41.131 --> 01:34:44.342
So do you. How's Mother?

782
01:34:44.718 --> 01:34:46.803
She gave me a letter for you.

783
01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:50.556
She's well.
Always worrying, as usual.


784
01:34:50.808 --> 01:34:54.227
And with age these things get worse.
Here it is.


785
01:34:55.521 --> 01:34:58.356
- Poor Mother.
- And you, dear boy...


786
01:34:58.649 --> 01:35:02.610
you could write more often,
and even come see us.


787
01:35:03.028 --> 01:35:06.239
When were you home last?
- I know, but things here...


788
01:35:08.367 --> 01:35:12.161
- She said hello. Is she an actress?
- An actress?


789
01:35:12.579 --> 01:35:16.290
She wishes!
She's a two-bit extra.


790
01:35:17.751 --> 01:35:22.421
- Dad, you want a gin fizz?
- "Gin fritz"?


791
01:35:22.548 --> 01:35:24.257
My beer is fine.

792
01:35:26.051 --> 01:35:30.596
This place is hopping at night!
Is it always like this?


793
01:35:30.722 --> 01:35:31.764
Yes.

794
01:35:31.932 --> 01:35:35.476
Back home
it's dead at this hour.


795
01:35:36.228 --> 01:35:39.689
But you're doing well here?
Have you adjusted?


796
01:35:39.857 --> 01:35:41.440
Sure, by now.

797
01:35:41.567 --> 01:35:43.734
Does your work pay well?

798
01:35:43.902 --> 01:35:47.029
Journalism pays quite well
if you're good at it.


799
01:35:47.156 --> 01:35:49.782
I'm lucky.
I've met the right people.


800
01:35:49.950 --> 01:35:52.660
I can even get into parliament
and the Vatican.


801
01:35:52.786 --> 01:35:56.372
I have a car, an apartment...
- Speaking of which...


802
01:35:56.540 --> 01:36:00.042
who's that woman
who always answers your phone?


803
01:36:00.252 --> 01:36:04.547
You're a grown man now.
Just don't do anything foolish.


804
01:36:04.673 --> 01:36:08.259
Have fun if you want,
but marriage is a serious matter.


805
01:36:08.385 --> 01:36:11.137
A woman just living with you...

806
01:36:11.305 --> 01:36:14.807
Now I understand.
You spoke with the cleaning lady.


807
01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:19.270
- So you finally found him?
- Yes, thanks.


808
01:36:19.771 --> 01:36:22.565
So you two have met?
- Sure.


809
01:36:22.733 --> 01:36:25.276
He told me to wait for you here.

810
01:36:25.652 --> 01:36:28.321
Are you a photographer?
- Yes.


811
01:36:28.488 --> 01:36:32.450
Interesting work.
Artistic, in a certain sense.


812
01:36:32.618 --> 01:36:36.621
You work with my son?
- Yeah, I got stuck with him.


813
01:36:37.331 --> 01:36:42.210
Any idea where the prince went?
I almost had him, but he got away.


814
01:36:42.336 --> 01:36:44.128
I'm gonna look for him.

815
01:36:44.254 --> 01:36:47.006
- Maybe you boys are busy?
- Not at all.


816
01:36:47.132 --> 01:36:49.926
Maybe you have an appointment...

817
01:36:50.385 --> 01:36:53.137
- My work is here too.
- Really?


818
01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:57.767
It's where you find interesting people,
or a bit of news, or a good picture.


819
01:36:57.935 --> 01:36:59.936
My paper's up there.
- I see.


820
01:37:00.479 --> 01:37:03.356
So you just sit here?

821
01:37:04.858 --> 01:37:07.568
- Shall we go to the movies?
- No.


822
01:37:07.694 --> 01:37:11.155
That's all I do at home.

823
01:37:11.531 --> 01:37:15.701
But I'll leave you alone now.

824
01:37:15.827 --> 01:37:19.121
You're young...
- No, Dad, we have nothing to do.


825
01:37:19.706 --> 01:37:25.503
What could we do this late
for a few hours before bed?


826
01:37:25.671 --> 01:37:29.298
- At this hour it's just nightclubs.
- That reminds me:


827
01:37:29.424 --> 01:37:33.177
A friend who came here
told me about a place.


828
01:37:33.303 --> 01:37:37.974
A kind of cabaret.
The Chi-Cha or Ki-Ka...


829
01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:40.184
The Cha-Cha?
That's an old one.


830
01:37:40.352 --> 01:37:42.979
- That's it! The Cha-Cha.
- You want to go there?


831
01:37:43.105 --> 01:37:46.482
Well, I suppose
we could have a look,


832
01:37:46.608 --> 01:37:49.026
since I'm here so rarely.

833
01:37:49.861 --> 01:37:53.197
Good idea!
Invite your friend. It's on me.


834
01:37:53.323 --> 01:37:57.201
No, I'll get this.
Let me handle it.


835
01:37:58.078 --> 01:38:00.621
- Antonio, come here.
- Waiter!


836
01:38:04.418 --> 01:38:07.211
- We're going with my father.
- Where?


837
01:38:07.421 --> 01:38:09.505
What about the prince?

838
01:38:09.798 --> 01:38:14.135
What? Oh, I see.
It's all lumped together here.


839
01:38:14.261 --> 01:38:16.554
Paparazzo, hurry up.

840
01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:18.222
Dad, over here.

841
01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:21.809
To the Cha
-Cha
-Cha.

842
01:38:21.935 --> 01:38:26.272
I have my Vespa here!
Take it for me, okay?


843
01:38:26.690 --> 01:38:29.525
Tell the boss
I'll call him at home.


844
01:38:29.735 --> 01:38:32.570
Get moving, boys!

845
01:38:55.761 --> 01:38:57.553
Will this table do?

846
01:38:57.679 --> 01:39:01.223
Nothing's changed!
Just like I remember it.


847
01:39:02.267 --> 01:39:07.104
Were you here in 1922?
- No, I was in Turin.


848
01:39:07.230 --> 01:39:10.191
I've only been in Rome
a few years.


849
01:39:19.618 --> 01:39:22.995
- Dad, you want a drink?
- Of course!


850
01:39:23.121 --> 01:39:26.040
- Whiskey?
- Yes, whiskey.


851
01:39:26.166 --> 01:39:27.792
Three whiskeys.

852
01:39:28.043 --> 01:39:31.128
- Very well. What label?
- Black & White.


853
01:39:31.338 --> 01:39:35.049
Why not do an article on this place?
It's like a cemetery.


854
01:39:35.175 --> 01:39:38.552
A beautiful woman!
Nice long gams.


855
01:39:38.845 --> 01:39:41.430
- What?
- He said she has long legs.


856
01:39:41.598 --> 01:39:43.641
Have you been to Paris?

857
01:39:43.809 --> 01:39:48.771
I was there a few times.
Once, in a cabaret like this,


858
01:39:48.897 --> 01:39:52.400
there was this beautiful girl,
with nice gams like that one.


859
01:39:52.526 --> 01:39:55.611
She began to strip,
and when she was naked,


860
01:39:55.987 --> 01:39:58.948
it turned out she was a he.

861
01:39:59.658 --> 01:40:02.368
Is your father still living?
- Yes.


862
01:40:02.661 --> 01:40:05.871
He must still be young.
What's he do?


863
01:40:06.164 --> 01:40:08.958
Nothing. He's a bum.
He just lazes around...


864
01:40:09.167 --> 01:40:12.128
bothering my poor mother and sister.

865
01:40:12.254 --> 01:40:15.881
He sings, whistles,
begs for money for the movies.


866
01:40:16.007 --> 01:40:18.259
It's not true.

867
01:40:51.585 --> 01:40:54.545
Paparazzo, look over there.

868
01:41:05.182 --> 01:41:08.642
- Lilly, look who's here!
- He's a looker!


869
01:41:16.735 --> 01:41:20.362
I'm still waiting to see
my picture in your paper, creep!


870
01:41:20.489 --> 01:41:22.239
You're beautiful!

871
01:41:22.407 --> 01:41:24.617
- What's her name?
- Fanny.


872
01:41:24.743 --> 01:41:27.411
- You know her well?
- You bet he does!


873
01:41:27.537 --> 01:41:30.080
- She's French.
- Very nice.


874
01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:32.208
She's French?

875
01:41:42.427 --> 01:41:44.094
Liar!

876
01:41:44.262 --> 01:41:47.097
Joker! Fibber!

877
01:41:47.432 --> 01:41:49.725
How can you stand him?

878
01:41:49.851 --> 01:41:52.603
- This is my father.
- Sure!


879
01:41:52.729 --> 01:41:54.480
- She doesn't believe me.
- Why not?


880
01:41:55.273 --> 01:41:57.650
- Really?
- Yes.


881
01:42:02.822 --> 01:42:04.907
My compliments!
You're beautiful!


882
01:42:05.075 --> 01:42:09.286
It's because I promised her a picture.
She's really very nice.


883
01:42:09.412 --> 01:42:11.372
I don't doubt it.

884
01:42:11.498 --> 01:42:13.707
- Shall we invite her over?
- Why not?


885
01:42:13.833 --> 01:42:15.709
Invite her over!

886
01:42:16.127 --> 01:42:19.505
And let's order some champagne.

887
01:42:19.631 --> 01:42:21.924
Orange soda is fine for her.

888
01:42:22.050 --> 01:42:25.928
- No, champagne is fine.
- We'll order Veuve Clicquot.


889
01:42:26.346 --> 01:42:29.598
Let me handle it.
I know about these things.


890
01:42:29.766 --> 01:42:32.101
I sold champagne to half of Italy!

891
01:42:32.644 --> 01:42:34.853
Meanwhile, here's your whiskey.

892
01:42:57.627 --> 01:42:59.837
To your health, my boy.

893
01:43:02.173 --> 01:43:04.425
- And to yours, Dad.
- Thanks.


894
01:43:09.848 --> 01:43:12.182
- It's good.
- Yes, it is.


895
01:43:19.649 --> 01:43:22.693
Did you order champagne?
Here it is.


896
01:43:22.861 --> 01:43:25.654
And it comes with a waitress!
What more could you want?


897
01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:28.032
Fanny. Don't get up.

898
01:43:28.366 --> 01:43:30.993
I'm not saying hello to you...
or you.


899
01:43:31.536 --> 01:43:35.414
Have you seen your son at work?
Some job!


900
01:43:35.707 --> 01:43:38.250
Send him back to his hometown.

901
01:43:39.085 --> 01:43:41.670
You can't really be his father.

902
01:43:41.796 --> 01:43:43.547
- I am!
- You're too young.


903
01:43:44.007 --> 01:43:47.676
Please, young lady,
let's forget about age.


904
01:43:47.802 --> 01:43:52.598
"Awaken not desperate sorrow
that presses upon my heart."


905
01:43:53.058 --> 01:43:55.934
The thing that ages us most
is boredom.


906
01:43:56.227 --> 01:43:58.937
I traveled a lot on business
as a young man,


907
01:43:59.064 --> 01:44:01.649
and I felt like a lion.

908
01:44:01.775 --> 01:44:06.737
Even now when I travel,
I can keep up with these guys.


909
01:44:06.905 --> 01:44:11.158
But when I'm at home,
I feel like I'm 80.


910
01:44:11.284 --> 01:44:15.204
What are you doing?
You take care of the Coca-Cola.


911
01:44:15.413 --> 01:44:18.082
I'll handle the champagne.

912
01:44:21.252 --> 01:44:22.628
Watch this.

913
01:44:28.802 --> 01:44:33.555
It's so beautiful.
It always makes me cry.


914
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:36.684
That's right! it makes me cry.

915
01:45:06.798 --> 01:45:09.216
For you, young lady.

916
01:45:11.678 --> 01:45:14.221
To your beautiful legs,

917
01:45:14.347 --> 01:45:17.433
which I've had
the good fortune to admire.


918
01:46:13.698 --> 01:46:15.199
Very good.

919
01:46:15.366 --> 01:46:20.204
But now we need
another little drop.


920
01:46:22.081 --> 01:46:25.542
First I toasted
your beautiful legs.


921
01:46:26.211 --> 01:46:28.170
Now I must toast...

922
01:46:33.384 --> 01:46:36.512
I wasn't going to say
anything scandalous.


923
01:46:36.888 --> 01:46:39.264
Your father is much nicer than you.

924
01:46:39.390 --> 01:46:41.934
Much nicer!

925
01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:45.103
Don't be silly, miss.

926
01:46:45.647 --> 01:46:48.482
Listen, I'll teach you
a challenging trick.


927
01:46:48.608 --> 01:46:50.776
Let's see if you can do it.

928
01:46:50.902 --> 01:46:55.239
Watch closely.
You put a coin on your forehead,


929
01:46:55.365 --> 01:46:57.866
then make it fall
without it touching your nose.


930
01:46:57.992 --> 01:47:01.787
- That's child's play!
- Want to try?


931
01:47:01.996 --> 01:47:07.584
I'll take a coin
and put it on your forehead.


932
01:47:07.752 --> 01:47:09.920
Let's see you do it.

933
01:47:10.964 --> 01:47:13.257
- Wait.
- I'm waiting.


934
01:47:15.385 --> 01:47:16.927
Wait...

935
01:47:20.932 --> 01:47:22.933
You got me!

936
01:47:23.101 --> 01:47:26.019
Now it's my turn to tell a joke.

937
01:47:26.604 --> 01:47:30.774
A nice little story.

938
01:47:31.025 --> 01:47:35.946
A woman sends her husband
to the market


939
01:47:36.114 --> 01:47:42.619
to buy three blouses,
six handkerchiefs, and...


940
01:47:43.121 --> 01:47:45.289
What's this thing
for women called?


941
01:47:45.665 --> 01:47:47.291
A bra.

942
01:47:48.793 --> 01:47:50.836
So he sets out,

943
01:47:50.962 --> 01:47:55.090
but along the way he has some wine
and forgets everything.


944
01:47:55.216 --> 01:47:58.302
When he gets home,
the teacher asks...


945
01:47:58.428 --> 01:48:01.221
- Teacher?
- His wife.


946
01:48:01.514 --> 01:48:04.308
"Did you forget my things?"

947
01:48:04.475 --> 01:48:07.769
"No! They're right here,"
and he takes out his handkerchief.


948
01:48:07.937 --> 01:48:10.981
- "Where are my handkerchiefs?"
- "Right here.


949
01:48:11.149 --> 01:48:14.985
One, two, three, four, five, six."

950
01:48:15.111 --> 01:48:16.987
"And my blouses?"

951
01:48:17.113 --> 01:48:20.532
"Right here. One, two."

952
01:48:20.658 --> 01:48:22.993
"And where's my bra?"

953
01:48:23.202 --> 01:48:27.039
"Wait, I bought it. 
I really did...

954
01:48:27.916 --> 01:48:30.125
Here it is!"

955
01:48:31.628 --> 01:48:35.380
- But you don't need one. I like yours.
- Dad!


956
01:48:35.506 --> 01:48:37.382
She's so beautiful!

957
01:48:38.676 --> 01:48:42.387
The champagne's all gone.
We need to order more.


958
01:48:42.513 --> 01:48:44.181
Waiter!

959
01:48:49.479 --> 01:48:52.856
Hey, this is a waltz!

960
01:48:53.316 --> 01:48:55.317
I have half a mind to...

961
01:48:55.443 --> 01:48:58.487
Miss, may I have this dance?
- Here I am.


962
01:48:58.613 --> 01:49:00.280
I'm ready too.

963
01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:05.077
What's wrong? I can manage!

964
01:49:15.838 --> 01:49:20.342
You know, when I was a boy...
Paparazzo, have one.


965
01:49:20.718 --> 01:49:23.470
When I was a boy,
he was never at home.


966
01:49:23.596 --> 01:49:27.557
He'd be away weeks at a time.
He was never there.


967
01:49:28.601 --> 01:49:31.061
How my mother cried!

968
01:49:31.896 --> 01:49:36.191
I almost never saw him.
I hardly even know him.


969
01:49:38.569 --> 01:49:41.238
But I've enjoyed
seeing him again tonight.


970
01:49:42.407 --> 01:49:45.033
He's a nice guy, huh?
- Very.


971
01:49:45.159 --> 01:49:49.705
Make sure he enjoys himself tonight.
- Yes, but...


972
01:49:52.125 --> 01:49:55.502
Maybe this isn't how
you dance to this music.


973
01:49:55.628 --> 01:49:58.005
Don't worry. I like this better.

974
01:49:58.131 --> 01:50:01.091
Really? Then let's dance!

975
01:50:01.884 --> 01:50:04.594
What extraordinary eyes!
- Really?


976
01:50:04.762 --> 01:50:09.266
I'm not sure how to take that.
- As a sign of my infinite admiration.


977
01:50:09.434 --> 01:50:11.935
I fear you're just like your son.

978
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:14.521
What? Like my son?

979
01:50:14.647 --> 01:50:17.357
We must be of the same breed!

980
01:50:22.071 --> 01:50:25.907
No! Daddy, come with me!

981
01:50:26.284 --> 01:50:29.703
Marcello, follow me.
You know where I live.


982
01:50:29.829 --> 01:50:33.665
Careful, 'cause I drive really fast,
though my car's not English!


983
01:50:34.625 --> 01:50:37.961
Dad, you're really going
to her place for spaghetti?


984
01:50:38.129 --> 01:50:41.506
Yes! He wants to have
spaghetti bolognese with me!


985
01:50:41.799 --> 01:50:43.216
Now go on!

986
01:50:43.342 --> 01:50:46.970
Are you comfortable
in my carriage?


987
01:50:47.138 --> 01:50:49.848
Dad, is everything all right?

988
01:50:50.016 --> 01:50:53.560
I'm in excellent company.
Now leave me alone.


989
01:50:53.811 --> 01:50:57.355
If you made love like I drive,
you'd be a happy man.


990
01:50:59.025 --> 01:51:02.027
- Be quiet!
- You'll wake everyone up.


991
01:51:03.946 --> 01:51:05.989
Don't drive too fast!

992
01:51:31.849 --> 01:51:34.851
My father's still
a good-looking man, huh?


993
01:51:43.194 --> 01:51:45.362
Gloria, wake up.

994
01:51:46.364 --> 01:51:50.408
You took the longest route.
Oh, my foot!


995
01:51:51.035 --> 01:51:53.578
Why did you take that route?

996
01:51:54.372 --> 01:51:57.415
Aren't you coming?
- No.


997
01:51:57.542 --> 01:51:59.084
Why not?

998
01:51:59.210 --> 01:52:02.879
I'm tired.
In fact, you know what?


999
01:52:03.047 --> 01:52:05.841
I'll leave you the car.
You take my dad home.


1000
01:52:05.967 --> 01:52:07.300
Come on!

1001
01:52:07.426 --> 01:52:09.845
Tell him

1002
01:52:09.971 --> 01:52:12.931
I had to rush to the printer.

1003
01:52:13.057 --> 01:52:16.226
And to call me before he leaves.

1004
01:52:16.352 --> 01:52:17.936
Come on!

1005
01:52:18.062 --> 01:52:19.771
I don't feel like it.

1006
01:52:19.897 --> 01:52:23.400
I don't know this neighborhood.
I'm going to walk around.


1007
01:52:30.116 --> 01:52:33.243
Where have you been?
It's been half an hour!


1008
01:52:37.248 --> 01:52:40.292
Marcello, your father's not well.
- What?


1009
01:52:41.085 --> 01:52:45.046
Maybe he drank too much.
I'm going to the pharmacy.


1010
01:52:45.173 --> 01:52:48.675
- You left him alone?
- He wants these drops.


1011
01:52:49.260 --> 01:52:52.262
Paparazzo, run to the pharmacy
and get these.


1012
01:52:52.388 --> 01:52:54.431
- What?
- Hurry!


1013
01:53:01.063 --> 01:53:03.565
- What floor?
- Third.


1014
01:53:15.494 --> 01:53:17.579
What number?

1015
01:53:17.872 --> 01:53:20.332
Don't shout!
It's a respectable building!


1016
01:53:33.512 --> 01:53:35.805
Turn off the light.

1017
01:53:36.599 --> 01:53:38.767
- Where's the light switch?
- There.


1018
01:53:43.272 --> 01:53:44.773
Wait there.

1019
01:53:45.191 --> 01:53:47.651
Paparazzo went to the pharmacy.
He'll be here soon.


1020
01:53:49.695 --> 01:53:53.156
It's nothing.
Maybe I drank a bit too much.


1021
01:53:53.950 --> 01:53:56.076
Of course it's nothing.

1022
01:53:59.622 --> 01:54:02.999
You want a glass of water?

1023
01:54:03.334 --> 01:54:05.710
No, it'll pass.

1024
01:54:17.223 --> 01:54:20.392
- What happened?
- I don't know. He felt ill.


1025
01:54:20.518 --> 01:54:23.770
I got so scared.
Marcello's in there now.


1026
01:54:28.025 --> 01:54:32.946
- Can I go in to make coffee?
- No, he said to wait here.


1027
01:54:44.959 --> 01:54:48.545
What's this neighborhood called?

1028
01:54:48.921 --> 01:54:50.880
Italia.

1029
01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:54.384
Never heard of it. Is it far?

1030
01:54:56.220 --> 01:54:58.221
When I'd come to Rome,

1031
01:54:58.389 --> 01:55:03.184
I always stayed in a hotel
near Piazza Fiume.


1032
01:55:09.233 --> 01:55:11.067
What time is it?

1033
01:55:11.777 --> 01:55:13.737
Almost 4:00.

1034
01:55:13.988 --> 01:55:16.239
There's a train at 5:30.

1035
01:55:16.657 --> 01:55:19.909
I have to catch it.
I can make it.


1036
01:55:20.286 --> 01:55:22.162
I'm sure I can make it.

1037
01:55:22.288 --> 01:55:26.416
Dad, why not come rest
at my place a while?


1038
01:55:26.584 --> 01:55:30.879
No, I'd rather leave now.
I can be home by 10:00.


1039
01:55:31.505 --> 01:55:33.882
Ah, my watch.
- You can leave later.


1040
01:55:34.091 --> 01:55:35.717
No.

1041
01:55:36.594 --> 01:55:39.637
I feel much better now.

1042
01:55:39.764 --> 01:55:44.267
Dad, please stay until tomorrow,

1043
01:55:44.435 --> 01:55:48.396
if not at my place,
then at your hotel.


1044
01:55:48.522 --> 01:55:50.398
What hotel are you at?

1045
01:55:51.233 --> 01:55:55.236
I'll skip work.
We can spend the day together.


1046
01:55:55.363 --> 01:55:57.822
We can talk and...

1047
01:55:59.658 --> 01:56:01.659
We never see each other.

1048
01:56:05.331 --> 01:56:08.208
I have to go.

1049
01:56:11.295 --> 01:56:12.962
The taxi's here.

1050
01:56:17.968 --> 01:56:20.678
Marcello, the taxi's here.
- What taxi?


1051
01:56:21.138 --> 01:56:22.931
I called for it.

1052
01:56:23.307 --> 01:56:25.225
Where's my hat?

1053
01:56:26.394 --> 01:56:29.104
We can send it away.

1054
01:56:29.230 --> 01:56:31.231
Go downstairs, will you?

1055
01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:36.778
Dad, don't leave.
- I want to go home.


1056
01:56:42.368 --> 01:56:46.704
Good-bye, young lady.
- Good-bye, and all the best.


1057
01:56:46.997 --> 01:56:48.498
Bye, Marcello.

1058
01:56:48.666 --> 01:56:52.335
It was nice seeing you, son.
Write to us.


1059
01:56:53.629 --> 01:56:55.672
No, don't come with me.

1060
01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:58.299
I prefer to go alone, please.

1061
01:57:35.379 --> 01:57:39.215
Think I'll keep quiet like her husband?
She cheats, and he says nothing!


1062
01:57:39.341 --> 01:57:41.718
He's just showing off for the ladies.

1063
01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:46.222
- What happened?
- I don't know, but it was exciting!


1064
01:57:46.348 --> 01:57:48.224
I'll find out.

1065
01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:50.727
Every word he wrote is true!

1066
01:57:50.895 --> 01:57:53.062
Come back here, you bastard!

1067
01:57:55.065 --> 01:57:57.734
- Nico!
- Marcellino, you evil man!


1068
01:57:57.902 --> 01:58:00.570
- How are you?
- Fine.


1069
01:58:00.738 --> 01:58:05.116
- Where are you going?
- To my fiancé's castle in Bassano.


1070
01:58:05.242 --> 01:58:07.785
- Can I come too?
- Sure.


1071
01:58:08.037 --> 01:58:11.247
Paparazzo was looking for you
for a fashion shoot.


1072
01:58:11.415 --> 01:58:14.959
I haven't modeled
for a year now.


1073
01:58:15.085 --> 01:58:18.087
- Nicolina!
- There they are.


1074
01:58:19.965 --> 01:58:21.966
Nicolina, we're here.

1075
01:58:22.134 --> 01:58:24.260
Is there room for my friend too?

1076
01:58:24.428 --> 01:58:26.638
- Try the other car.
- What a shame.


1077
01:58:26.805 --> 01:58:29.891
See you at the castle.
- Okay, bye.


1078
01:58:32.102 --> 01:58:34.979
Is there room
for two forlorn souls?


1079
01:58:36.607 --> 01:58:39.901
- Ride in the next car.
- Oh, God!


1080
01:58:42.154 --> 01:58:45.573
Oliviero, can my friend come too?

1081
01:58:45.699 --> 01:58:47.784
One of those pimps you fall for?

1082
01:58:47.952 --> 01:58:49.827
Come on.

1083
01:58:51.539 --> 01:58:56.292
- There's a shortcut after Capranica.
- Follow us.


1084
01:59:07.304 --> 01:59:09.973
Let's hope not,
so we can go to bed early.


1085
01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:12.559
Only the old fogies
will be there now.


1086
01:59:12.685 --> 01:59:18.439
Our parties are famous
for being first-class funerals.


1087
01:59:19.149 --> 01:59:23.820
- Your brother's off hunting, I believe.
- Irene, take this mutt.


1088
01:59:24.154 --> 01:59:25.822
Pass him here.

1089
01:59:30.494 --> 01:59:32.537
Where are we going?

1090
01:59:34.498 --> 01:59:38.376
Excuse me, where are we going?
- Bassano di Sutri.


1091
01:59:42.715 --> 01:59:45.842
What are you whining about?
What language is that?


1092
01:59:46.010 --> 01:59:47.885
Eskimo.

1093
02:00:09.908 --> 02:00:13.077
Good evening to you all!

1094
02:00:19.627 --> 02:00:23.087
Where are you taking that?

1095
02:00:23.505 --> 02:00:26.090
Watch out
or you'll spill everything!


1096
02:00:28.427 --> 02:00:30.511
Massamilla!
- Hello, Clemente.


1097
02:00:30.638 --> 02:00:32.889
Giulio, look who I brought.

1098
02:00:36.060 --> 02:00:38.227
You big slut.

1099
02:00:42.232 --> 02:00:44.275
Who told you to come here?

1100
02:00:57.623 --> 02:01:01.042
They came from all over Italy.
We were all there.


1101
02:01:01.210 --> 02:01:04.045
It was a touching ceremony,

1102
02:01:04.213 --> 02:01:06.839
the people laying flowers
at the tomb


1103
02:01:06.965 --> 02:01:08.925
of their beloved leader.

1104
02:01:09.093 --> 02:01:12.720
Excuse me, but we haven't met.
I'm the youngest son.


1105
02:01:12.846 --> 02:01:15.556
The least important, naturally.

1106
02:01:16.308 --> 02:01:20.687
Would you like to meet
other members of the family?


1107
02:01:20.813 --> 02:01:22.522
Grandmother.

1108
02:01:23.232 --> 02:01:25.316
No, don't bother her.

1109
02:01:27.444 --> 02:01:30.947
- I'd like you to meet Mr...
- Rubini. Pleased to meet you.


1110
02:01:32.157 --> 02:01:34.867
She pretends she's asleep
to avoid talking to anybody.


1111
02:01:35.285 --> 02:01:37.995
Let's continue climbing
the family tree.


1112
02:01:38.122 --> 02:01:41.290
Father, meet Mr. Rubini.

1113
02:01:41.458 --> 02:01:43.584
He looks like he actually works.

1114
02:01:43.711 --> 02:01:45.962
Really? How do you do?

1115
02:01:52.302 --> 02:01:55.596
- What a handsome young man!
- Are you a journalist?


1116
02:01:55.764 --> 02:02:00.768
I need a nanny to put me to bed.
Will you do it, Jane?


1117
02:02:01.478 --> 02:02:03.479
Be my nanny tonight.

1118
02:02:04.773 --> 02:02:08.359
Lady Rodd, don't you ever wash
these dogs? They stink.


1119
02:02:08.527 --> 02:02:11.070
They smell wonderful!

1120
02:02:11.905 --> 02:02:15.241
This is our Irene,
the most beautiful debutante this year,


1121
02:02:15.367 --> 02:02:18.828
whom I'd love to marry, but...
- I know who he is.


1122
02:02:18.954 --> 02:02:20.496
Excuse me.

1123
02:02:22.458 --> 02:02:23.958
Come on.

1124
02:02:24.626 --> 02:02:26.335
Let's dance.

1125
02:02:27.212 --> 02:02:29.630
Was he the one
making advances, or you?


1126
02:02:29.798 --> 02:02:31.758
Me, of course.

1127
02:02:35.888 --> 02:02:39.557
You're dying to see
your name in the paper, huh?


1128
02:02:39.892 --> 02:02:44.812
Why don't we go somewhere quiet?
- Like where?


1129
02:02:49.234 --> 02:02:53.696
So was my first husband,
but he always exaggerated his news.


1130
02:02:53.864 --> 02:02:58.242
Poor me. I only realized it
when the honeymoon had ended.


1131
02:03:01.163 --> 02:03:04.707
Better exaggerated news
than no news at all.


1132
02:03:04.875 --> 02:03:07.251
My husband thinks so too.

1133
02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:11.839
It's often the public
who demands these exaggerations.


1134
02:03:12.049 --> 02:03:16.093
Personally, I could give you news

1135
02:03:16.261 --> 02:03:18.346
that isn't exaggerated at all.

1136
02:03:22.768 --> 02:03:24.435
I know this perfume.

1137
02:03:24.603 --> 02:03:26.187
Maddalena!

1138
02:03:26.355 --> 02:03:28.606
Where did they find you?

1139
02:03:29.608 --> 02:03:33.194
I'm fine. I'm drunk.
Do you know Jane?


1140
02:03:34.363 --> 02:03:38.991
She's an American painter
who thinks Rome is a colony.


1141
02:03:39.785 --> 02:03:42.954
Everyone invites her over
for the filthy things she says.


1142
02:03:43.121 --> 02:03:45.289
She's lots of fun.

1143
02:03:46.542 --> 02:03:48.000
The Montalbani.

1144
02:03:49.628 --> 02:03:53.422
"Federica the Wolf."
She likes to suckle youngsters.


1145
02:03:53.549 --> 02:03:57.468
The Confalonieri own half of Calabria
and Rome's finest love nests.


1146
02:03:58.262 --> 02:04:02.974
Little Eleonora: 200,000 acres
and two suicide attempts.


1147
02:04:03.141 --> 02:04:05.977
The Sanseverinos:
a splendid Tuscan castle.


1148
02:04:06.144 --> 02:04:08.271
That's Don Giulio and Nico,

1149
02:04:08.647 --> 02:04:11.941
his Swedish friend,
soon to be a princess.


1150
02:04:12.067 --> 02:04:14.151
Don't make that face.

1151
02:04:14.278 --> 02:04:16.654
You think we're any better?

1152
02:04:17.322 --> 02:04:21.576
At least they do these things
with a certain elegance.


1153
02:04:26.331 --> 02:04:28.749
Who lives in that villa
on the grounds?


1154
02:04:28.876 --> 02:04:31.085
No one. It's empty.

1155
02:04:31.753 --> 02:04:34.338
It has the nicest style
of all the buildings.


1156
02:04:36.425 --> 02:04:39.468
I'm empty too, you know?

1157
02:04:43.557 --> 02:04:45.933
Who are these women?

1158
02:04:47.102 --> 02:04:49.937
Great-grandmothers,
great-great-grandmothers...


1159
02:04:52.190 --> 02:04:56.110
Beautiful women. Did you notice
they all have the same eyes?


1160
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:02.617
You know,
I've thought about you often.


1161
02:05:03.035 --> 02:05:06.203
I don't understand you at all.
- Really?


1162
02:05:10.334 --> 02:05:12.043
Neither do I.

1163
02:05:14.379 --> 02:05:16.297
It doesn't matter.

1164
02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:22.303
If you're looking
for a serious conversation, forget it.


1165
02:05:24.056 --> 02:05:25.640
How's your lady friend?

1166
02:05:26.725 --> 02:05:29.477
So you're afraid
of serious conversations?


1167
02:05:31.188 --> 02:05:33.230
But you can't talk seriously.

1168
02:05:33.357 --> 02:05:35.566
Or can you?
- Where are you taking me?


1169
02:05:38.070 --> 02:05:41.405
This is the room
for serious conversations.


1170
02:05:42.741 --> 02:05:44.033
Sit down.

1171
02:05:44.159 --> 02:05:46.035
What are we doing?

1172
02:05:46.995 --> 02:05:48.746
Where are you going?

1173
02:06:12.437 --> 02:06:14.605
Marcello, can you hear me?

1174
02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:18.359
Have you ever felt me so close?

1175
02:06:19.319 --> 02:06:22.822
Where are you?
Can you hear me?


1176
02:06:22.948 --> 02:06:25.449
- Yes.
- Where are you talking from?


1177
02:06:25.575 --> 02:06:28.619
Far, far away...

1178
02:06:29.287 --> 02:06:33.124
If I kept quiet,
it'd be like I no longer existed.


1179
02:06:48.306 --> 02:06:50.766
I'm still here. Don't leave.

1180
02:06:55.063 --> 02:06:57.064
Would you marry me?

1181
02:06:59.317 --> 02:07:00.985
And you?

1182
02:07:01.153 --> 02:07:04.363
Yes, I'm in love with you.

1183
02:07:05.157 --> 02:07:06.323
Since when?

1184
02:07:08.243 --> 02:07:11.996
Listen.
Know what this sound is?


1185
02:07:12.414 --> 02:07:14.081
No, I don't.

1186
02:07:14.583 --> 02:07:16.542
Guess what this is.

1187
02:07:19.129 --> 02:07:22.006
- A kiss?
- For you.


1188
02:07:22.591 --> 02:07:24.800
So will you marry me?

1189
02:07:24.926 --> 02:07:27.178
Or are you afraid to answer?

1190
02:07:28.346 --> 02:07:31.098
Why this question?
You're drunk, you know.


1191
02:07:31.850 --> 02:07:33.809
Yes, a little.

1192
02:07:34.686 --> 02:07:36.771
I love you, Marcello.

1193
02:07:41.651 --> 02:07:45.196
I'd like to be your wife
and be faithful to you.


1194
02:07:45.322 --> 02:07:48.199
I'd like it all: to be your wife...

1195
02:07:48.366 --> 02:07:50.701
and to whore around
and have fun.


1196
02:07:51.036 --> 02:07:55.039
I feel that I love you tonight,
that I need you.


1197
02:07:55.957 --> 02:07:58.667
- Is that true?
- Yes, it's true.


1198
02:07:58.877 --> 02:08:02.379
I don't know if you're joking,
but it doesn't matter.


1199
02:08:02.547 --> 02:08:07.468
I love you. I want to be with you always.
- You'd hate me in a few months.


1200
02:08:08.970 --> 02:08:11.138
Why should I hate you?

1201
02:08:11.723 --> 02:08:14.558
Because you can have
one thing or the other,


1202
02:08:14.726 --> 02:08:16.894
and it's too late
for me to choose.


1203
02:08:17.062 --> 02:08:19.480
I've never wanted to choose.

1204
02:08:19.606 --> 02:08:24.068
I'm just a whore,
and I'll always be a whore.


1205
02:08:24.611 --> 02:08:26.737
I don't want to be anything else!

1206
02:08:26.905 --> 02:08:31.158
That's not true.
You're an extraordinary woman.


1207
02:08:32.619 --> 02:08:35.079
Your courage, your honesty...

1208
02:08:35.914 --> 02:08:37.790
I really do need you.

1209
02:08:39.251 --> 02:08:42.044
Your desperation
gives me strength.


1210
02:08:42.754 --> 02:08:45.840
You'd be a marvelous companion.

1211
02:08:45.966 --> 02:08:48.425
I could tell you everything.

1212
02:08:49.928 --> 02:08:51.846
You hear me?

1213
02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:54.098
Answer me.

1214
02:08:54.766 --> 02:08:58.936
Enough of this game. Come back.
I want to talk to you.


1215
02:09:19.875 --> 02:09:22.960
- We're off to catch ghosts.
- Is Maddalena with you?


1216
02:09:51.031 --> 02:09:56.160
In 1922 I spent a night
in a castle like this near Genzano.


1217
02:09:56.328 --> 02:10:00.998
We saw a little girl with a candle
appear in my sister-in-law's castle.


1218
02:10:01.166 --> 02:10:05.669
- It turned out it wasn't a little girl.
- Or a candle!


1219
02:10:05.921 --> 02:10:08.172
Don't be silly.

1220
02:10:29.361 --> 02:10:31.862
I bet you that when I die...

1221
02:10:32.030 --> 02:10:34.198
Listen to the silence!

1222
02:10:34.532 --> 02:10:38.077
- Look, a light!
- That's a candle reflected in the window.


1223
02:10:38.203 --> 02:10:40.204
You have no imagination!

1224
02:10:40.372 --> 02:10:44.375
Don't you remember the farmers
talking about a hunchback?


1225
02:10:44.668 --> 02:10:48.003
Giulio,
is there no electricity out here?


1226
02:10:48.129 --> 02:10:50.381
Watch out for bats!

1227
02:10:50.507 --> 02:10:53.676
Bats? They're my favorite.

1228
02:10:53.802 --> 02:10:56.887
Watch out, Nicolina.
The politician is after you.


1229
02:10:57.055 --> 02:11:00.391
Dear, the key isn't in the door.

1230
02:11:00.558 --> 02:11:03.560
It must be on the ground.
Give me some light.


1231
02:11:04.479 --> 02:11:06.647
I don't see it.

1232
02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:11.902
It's not here.
We have to go back.


1233
02:11:12.070 --> 02:11:14.905
- Here's the key.
- Give it here.


1234
02:11:15.073 --> 02:11:17.992
- Well done!
- Who found it? Nicolina?


1235
02:11:18.743 --> 02:11:22.913
- When were you last inside here?
- About two years ago.


1236
02:11:23.665 --> 02:11:27.751
I'd turn it into a great bachelor pad,
but Father says no.


1237
02:11:27.919 --> 02:11:30.254
Will you be writing an article

1238
02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:32.673
about the stupid
and corrupt aristocracy?


1239
02:11:32.841 --> 02:11:36.593
First, I write about other things.
Second, you're not that interesting.


1240
02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:39.930
Who came here with Maddalena?
- Who's Maddalena?


1241
02:11:42.058 --> 02:11:45.686
Careful. It's full of mice,
cockroaches, vipers, and vampires...


1242
02:11:45.854 --> 02:11:48.939
and now sluts.
- Thank you.


1243
02:11:51.776 --> 02:11:54.445
I'll go ahead and light the way.

1244
02:11:55.363 --> 02:11:59.575
- Giulio, when was this built?
- Five centuries ago.


1245
02:11:59.951 --> 02:12:01.910
Five centuries of love.

1246
02:12:02.078 --> 02:12:04.621
- Any popes in the family?
- Two.


1247
02:12:04.789 --> 02:12:08.375
- Countess Cristina.
- If you're scared, I'll hold you.


1248
02:12:08.501 --> 02:12:10.544
Two popes, darling!

1249
02:12:11.296 --> 02:12:13.297
I'll be your guide.

1250
02:12:13.423 --> 02:12:15.424
This way.

1251
02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:18.594
We're sweeping the floor
with our gowns.


1252
02:12:18.762 --> 02:12:22.556
- Irene, I could love you up here.
- You clown!


1253
02:12:25.643 --> 02:12:28.937
Allow me to say
you're like a beautiful apparition


1254
02:12:29.064 --> 02:12:31.315
right out of a painting.

1255
02:12:43.161 --> 02:12:45.537
What a disaster!

1256
02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:50.292
This whole room
would have to be shored up.


1257
02:12:55.507 --> 02:13:00.511
Giulio, it pains me
to see this place crumble.


1258
02:13:00.678 --> 02:13:06.100
But you're always in Rome.
You don't look after it.


1259
02:13:06.226 --> 02:13:08.227
What can I do, Dad?

1260
02:13:08.353 --> 02:13:11.271
What?
This will all be yours one day.


1261
02:13:11.398 --> 02:13:14.149
Giulio, I'm your forefather.

1262
02:13:14.275 --> 02:13:16.527
Go away, you idiot.

1263
02:13:21.366 --> 02:13:24.952
If you see a ghost,
leap into my arms.


1264
02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:26.495
All right.

1265
02:13:32.877 --> 02:13:34.378
Eugenio, stop it!

1266
02:13:35.338 --> 02:13:37.214
Otherwise go away.

1267
02:13:37.549 --> 02:13:39.466
Is your aunt a medium?

1268
02:13:39.592 --> 02:13:41.218
Didn't you know?

1269
02:13:41.386 --> 02:13:44.888
Her husband left her because
there was always a ghost in her bed.


1270
02:13:45.056 --> 02:13:46.473
I remember.

1271
02:13:47.225 --> 02:13:51.019
We've met somewhere.
I don't forget a face like that.


1272
02:13:51.146 --> 02:13:54.231
Well, I work,
so perhaps it was in some office.


1273
02:13:54.357 --> 02:13:56.400
- You work?
- Yes.


1274
02:13:57.652 --> 02:13:59.736
Who are you trying to summon?

1275
02:14:02.115 --> 02:14:04.783
- Stop fooling around.
- Cristina's making me laugh.


1276
02:14:04.909 --> 02:14:07.035
It's not true.

1277
02:14:07.871 --> 02:14:09.663
Who are you?

1278
02:14:11.291 --> 02:14:13.709
Who do you wish
to communicate with?


1279
02:14:13.835 --> 02:14:15.586
I feel an energy.

1280
02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:17.671
Keep the contact, Countess.

1281
02:14:17.797 --> 02:14:19.923
And don't laugh.
- I'm not.


1282
02:14:20.091 --> 02:14:23.093
Do you have a message
for one of us?


1283
02:14:23.470 --> 02:14:25.012
Answer, please.

1284
02:14:25.638 --> 02:14:30.767
What's that light down there
blinking on and off?


1285
02:14:30.935 --> 02:14:33.020
Don't be scared.
It's a tractor.


1286
02:14:33.146 --> 02:14:35.606
In summer they work at night too.

1287
02:14:38.067 --> 02:14:40.694
- Call Sister Edvige.
- Who's she?


1288
02:14:40.862 --> 02:14:44.948
A nun who walks around
with her head on a plate.


1289
02:14:45.116 --> 02:14:46.575
Don't be stupid.

1290
02:14:47.577 --> 02:14:51.747
Is it you again?
Who won't you leave me alone?


1291
02:14:52.081 --> 02:14:54.249
Please go away!

1292
02:14:55.585 --> 02:14:57.836
Ask if it's the same woman
as last time.


1293
02:14:57.962 --> 02:15:00.839
The scent
of your breath in my lungs


1294
02:15:00.965 --> 02:15:03.425
and your blood in my veins!

1295
02:15:06.471 --> 02:15:08.555
She's just drunk.

1296
02:15:14.687 --> 02:15:16.647
Why's she doing that?

1297
02:15:17.815 --> 02:15:19.942
Blow out the candles!

1298
02:15:21.277 --> 02:15:23.320
Blow them out!

1299
02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:32.079
Who are you?
Tell me who you are.


1300
02:15:35.833 --> 02:15:38.335
Who do you wish
to communicate with?


1301
02:15:39.337 --> 02:15:41.046
Giulio?

1302
02:15:41.172 --> 02:15:44.007
Giulio, there's a message for you.

1303
02:15:44.801 --> 02:15:47.678
That slut is in love with you.

1304
02:15:48.513 --> 02:15:51.723
Giulio, you can't run from my love.

1305
02:15:53.518 --> 02:15:57.854
- Enough! Let's have some light!
- We're just joking around.


1306
02:15:58.356 --> 02:16:00.524
Irene, come here.

1307
02:16:04.904 --> 02:16:06.989
Who are you, poor soul?

1308
02:16:07.865 --> 02:16:09.741
Why are you crying?

1309
02:16:13.454 --> 02:16:15.289
Why are you crying?

1310
02:16:24.799 --> 02:16:26.717
Wait, I'll light a match.

1311
02:16:47.447 --> 02:16:49.239
No, not here.

1312
02:16:49.407 --> 02:16:51.617
What are you doing?

1313
02:16:51.993 --> 02:16:54.995
You're crazy, darling!

1314
02:17:11.095 --> 02:17:14.222
This is the first time
I've seen the dawn.


1315
02:17:30.865 --> 02:17:33.325
Marcello, have you met my son?

1316
02:17:34.369 --> 02:17:36.161
Pleased to meet you.

1317
02:17:40.750 --> 02:17:44.461
Shall we go have some spaghetti?

1318
02:17:50.134 --> 02:17:53.762
One egg for 45 lira?
Forget it.


1319
02:17:53.888 --> 02:17:56.473
We'll buy them in Capranica.

1320
02:17:59.852 --> 02:18:01.812
Still out and about at this hour?

1321
02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:04.564
Good morning.

1322
02:18:08.653 --> 02:18:12.656
- Did you sleep well, Mother?
- Think you're still a young thing?


1323
02:18:13.324 --> 02:18:15.826
We went up to the old villa.

1324
02:18:15.952 --> 02:18:18.662
Is crazy Francesca with you?

1325
02:18:19.330 --> 02:18:22.666
- Who's she?
- The princess mother.


1326
02:18:35.513 --> 02:18:39.141
What have I done
to be treated this way?


1327
02:18:39.559 --> 02:18:42.185
Even dogs aren't treated like this!

1328
02:18:42.353 --> 02:18:44.312
Who do you think you are?

1329
02:18:46.649 --> 02:18:51.319
If you loved me half as much
as I love you, you'd understand.


1330
02:18:51.487 --> 02:18:52.696
Sure.

1331
02:18:52.864 --> 02:18:56.366
- But you don't love anyone!
- Stop shouting.


1332
02:18:56.534 --> 02:19:01.288
- You don't know what love is!
- And I suppose you do.


1333
02:19:01.414 --> 02:19:05.333
Your heart is closed and empty.

1334
02:19:05.460 --> 02:19:09.296
All you think about is women...
and you think that's love!


1335
02:19:09.422 --> 02:19:12.215
You've been saying that
for four hours.


1336
02:19:12.383 --> 02:19:15.844
I've heard enough!
I want to go home!


1337
02:19:16.387 --> 02:19:19.723
Some men are happy to find
someone who loves them.


1338
02:19:19.891 --> 02:19:22.559
They don't go running
after other women.


1339
02:19:22.685 --> 02:19:25.145
You're the only one like this!

1340
02:19:25.271 --> 02:19:27.981
It's a disgrace!

1341
02:19:28.149 --> 02:19:32.402
My disgrace is having met you!

1342
02:19:32.737 --> 02:19:34.237
Understand?

1343
02:19:34.363 --> 02:19:36.490
I can't stand being around you!

1344
02:19:36.866 --> 02:19:38.408
Go away!

1345
02:19:38.618 --> 02:19:41.411
Go away and never come back!

1346
02:19:47.084 --> 02:19:49.836
Where are you going, stupid?
Come back.


1347
02:19:50.046 --> 02:19:53.215
Leave me alone!
Let me live my life!


1348
02:20:01.015 --> 02:20:03.600
Get in the car, you idiot!

1349
02:20:05.561 --> 02:20:07.562
Look, Emma, I'll...

1350
02:20:13.861 --> 02:20:15.111
Get in.

1351
02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:19.241
What do you want from me?

1352
02:20:20.576 --> 02:20:23.119
You're a miserable worm!

1353
02:20:23.496 --> 02:20:26.289
You'll end up all alone like a dog!

1354
02:20:28.167 --> 02:20:29.876
You'll see.

1355
02:20:30.294 --> 02:20:33.630
Who'll stay with you
if I leave you?


1356
02:20:36.300 --> 02:20:39.219
What will you do with your life?

1357
02:20:39.345 --> 02:20:41.471
No one will love you like I do.

1358
02:20:41.764 --> 02:20:45.058
I can't spend my life loving you.

1359
02:20:45.434 --> 02:20:47.853
You say I'm the crazy one,

1360
02:20:47.979 --> 02:20:51.356
living in a dream,
out of touch with reality.


1361
02:20:52.149 --> 02:20:55.318
But it's you
who's got it all wrong.


1362
02:20:55.945 --> 02:20:59.990
Can't you see you already have
the most important thing in life?


1363
02:21:00.199 --> 02:21:05.745
A woman who really loves you,
who'd give her life for you.


1364
02:21:06.956 --> 02:21:08.957
But you spoil everything.

1365
02:21:09.375 --> 02:21:13.169
You're always restless, unhappy.

1366
02:21:20.011 --> 02:21:24.306
When two people love each other,
nothing else matters.


1367
02:21:24.807 --> 02:21:27.017
What are you afraid of?

1368
02:21:27.977 --> 02:21:30.687
Of you... your selfishness...

1369
02:21:30.855 --> 02:21:33.023
your miserable ideals.

1370
02:21:33.274 --> 02:21:36.067
You offer me a life
fit for a worm.


1371
02:21:36.193 --> 02:21:38.695
You only talk of cooking and bed.

1372
02:21:38.863 --> 02:21:42.198
A man who lives like that
is done for!


1373
02:21:42.325 --> 02:21:44.367
He's nothing but a worm!

1374
02:21:44.952 --> 02:21:49.331
I don't believe in your aggressive,
clinging, maternal love!


1375
02:21:49.498 --> 02:21:51.875
I don't want it!
I don't need it!


1376
02:21:52.335 --> 02:21:55.086
That's not love, it's degradation!

1377
02:21:55.504 --> 02:21:57.714
I can't live like this!

1378
02:21:57.882 --> 02:22:01.051
I don't want to be
with you anymore!


1379
02:22:01.218 --> 02:22:03.553
Get out!
- No!


1380
02:22:03.721 --> 02:22:06.681
You're a swine, a coward!
I feel sorry for you!


1381
02:22:07.099 --> 02:22:09.976
And you make me sick!
Get out!


1382
02:22:10.394 --> 02:22:13.188
No! I'm staying here with you.

1383
02:22:13.397 --> 02:22:16.566
No, you're not. Get out.

1384
02:22:25.743 --> 02:22:27.410
Get out of the car.

1385
02:22:27.745 --> 02:22:30.538
Get out of the car! It's over!

1386
02:22:32.500 --> 02:22:35.293
It's over! Get lost!

1387
02:22:35.920 --> 02:22:37.545
Bastard!

1388
02:22:37.755 --> 02:22:40.548
You're a bastard!
A louse!


1389
02:22:41.926 --> 02:22:44.928
Damn you!
- I never want to see you again!


1390
02:22:46.180 --> 02:22:49.057
Hitch a ride with a trucker,
you slut!


1391
02:22:49.225 --> 02:22:51.184
Run off to your whores!

1392
02:23:59.003 --> 02:24:00.420
Hello.

1393
02:24:04.341 --> 02:24:05.842
Where?

1394
02:24:14.518 --> 02:24:16.603
You can't go past here.

1395
02:24:17.021 --> 02:24:18.521
Go ahead.

1396
02:24:19.523 --> 02:24:22.192
Let him through!

1397
02:24:26.197 --> 02:24:29.866
- It's just awful, Marcello.
- What happened?


1398
02:24:31.660 --> 02:24:32.786
Tiziano!

1399
02:24:33.329 --> 02:24:36.706
He shot his two children
and then killed himself.


1400
02:24:44.215 --> 02:24:46.716
Marcello, get me inside.

1401
02:24:47.218 --> 02:24:49.886
I'll give your paper the pictures.

1402
02:24:50.137 --> 02:24:52.972
Get me inside.

1403
02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:56.059
- I'm a friend. I have to come in.
- One moment.


1404
02:24:57.728 --> 02:25:01.022
Inspector, a man here says
he's a friend of Steiner's.


1405
02:25:01.190 --> 02:25:02.398
Let him in.

1406
02:25:04.860 --> 02:25:07.195
Just him, just him.

1407
02:25:10.991 --> 02:25:12.826
Come in.

1408
02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:19.165
From floor to bullet hole:
five feet.


1409
02:25:21.919 --> 02:25:25.380
Left wall to bullet hole:

1410
02:25:28.884 --> 02:25:32.762
No, the wife doesn't know yet.
She'll be back at 1:00.


1411
02:25:34.431 --> 02:25:37.183
It seems he first called a friend

1412
02:25:37.309 --> 02:25:42.438
and begged her
to meet his wife at the bus stop.


1413
02:25:42.565 --> 02:25:46.609
Rear wall to bullet hole:

1414
02:25:48.946 --> 02:25:51.447
Let's hear that again.
Rewind it.


1415
02:25:57.288 --> 02:25:59.831
You're the true primitive,

1416
02:25:59.999 --> 02:26:02.333
primitive like a gothic spire.

1417
02:26:02.459 --> 02:26:04.669
You're so tall

1418
02:26:04.795 --> 02:26:07.380
that no voices
can reach you up there.


1419
02:26:07.548 --> 02:26:10.466
Really? If you could see
my real height,


1420
02:26:10.634 --> 02:26:12.969
you'd see I'm no taller than this.

1421
02:26:15.764 --> 02:26:18.683
Were you a friend of the family?

1422
02:26:18.809 --> 02:26:20.810
I was a friend of Steiner's.

1423
02:26:21.312 --> 02:26:25.231
- For how long? Were you close?
- Had you seen him recently?


1424
02:26:25.399 --> 02:26:27.442
Could you tell us about him?

1425
02:26:28.068 --> 02:26:32.697
No. I was his friend,
but we didn't see each other often.


1426
02:26:32.823 --> 02:26:34.657
I know nothing.

1427
02:26:36.869 --> 02:26:38.328
Nothing at all.

1428
02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:42.373
Ten feet.

1429
02:26:42.750 --> 02:26:44.584
Foggia.

1430
02:26:50.174 --> 02:26:54.636
Was anything unusual
going on in his life?


1431
02:26:54.845 --> 02:26:57.639
Financial problems,
anything like that?


1432
02:26:57.765 --> 02:26:59.682
I don't think so.

1433
02:27:00.100 --> 02:27:02.727
Had he ever shown
suicidal tendencies?


1434
02:27:04.521 --> 02:27:05.855
I don't know.

1435
02:27:06.023 --> 02:27:09.108
All right.
Please remain at our disposal.


1436
02:27:09.443 --> 02:27:11.569
Mondini, get the gun.

1437
02:27:11.695 --> 02:27:16.532
He was a cheerful man
who adored his family.


1438
02:27:17.284 --> 02:27:20.870
His was
an almost morbid adoration.


1439
02:27:25.417 --> 02:27:29.879
The weapon used
was a new Browning .675.


1440
02:27:30.005 --> 02:27:32.966
It was found beside his body,

1441
02:27:33.092 --> 02:27:36.219
which was seated
in an armchair near the fireplace


1442
02:27:36.387 --> 02:27:38.554
in an unusual position.

1443
02:27:47.064 --> 02:27:49.399
I'm finished here.
I'll continue at the morgue.


1444
02:27:49.733 --> 02:27:51.484
Fine, thanks.

1445
02:27:52.236 --> 02:27:55.196
- Can we cover the body, sir?
- Yes.


1446
02:27:55.656 --> 02:27:56.781
De Angelis?

1447
02:28:04.081 --> 02:28:06.541
Did you get pictures
of everything here?


1448
02:28:06.667 --> 02:28:09.335
Then let's go to the children's room.

1449
02:28:09.461 --> 02:28:11.087
This way.

1450
02:28:12.756 --> 02:28:17.385
It's time I went down
and met his wife at the bus stop.


1451
02:28:17.928 --> 02:28:21.347
I'll take someone from the building,
because I don't know her.


1452
02:28:21.849 --> 02:28:23.975
- I'll come.
- Thank you.


1453
02:28:25.269 --> 02:28:26.769
Let's go.

1454
02:28:26.895 --> 02:28:29.314
Come down to the bus stop
when you're finished.


1455
02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:32.942
If anyone from the station comes,
call me at the office.


1456
02:29:01.638 --> 02:29:05.391
Boys, a little compassion, please,
just this once.


1457
02:29:05.851 --> 02:29:09.979
Tell your colleagues.
This is going too far.


1458
02:29:20.449 --> 02:29:22.909
Maybe he was just afraid.

1459
02:29:24.161 --> 02:29:25.995
You mean Steiner?

1460
02:29:26.163 --> 02:29:28.247
Had someone threatened him?

1461
02:29:28.374 --> 02:29:31.167
No, not in the way you mean.

1462
02:29:32.002 --> 02:29:34.587
Maybe he was afraid of himself...

1463
02:29:35.506 --> 02:29:37.215
of us all.

1464
02:29:38.884 --> 02:29:40.760
When's the bus due?

1465
02:30:06.703 --> 02:30:08.329
That's her.

1466
02:30:09.623 --> 02:30:11.499
Please come with me.

1467
02:30:20.300 --> 02:30:23.719
What's going on?
Do you think I'm an actress?


1468
02:30:24.304 --> 02:30:26.222
What are you doing?

1469
02:30:26.557 --> 02:30:29.308
What do you want?
- Stop it! Get lost!


1470
02:30:29.435 --> 02:30:31.060
Marcello, what's going on?

1471
02:30:31.228 --> 02:30:34.981
I'm Mr. Lucenti.
I must speak with you a moment.


1472
02:30:35.149 --> 02:30:39.402
- Has something happened?
- Please come to my car.


1473
02:30:39.570 --> 02:30:41.904
There's been
an unfortunate incident.


1474
02:30:42.030 --> 02:30:44.532
Don't be frightened.

1475
02:30:44.700 --> 02:30:48.369
- The children!
- Please come with us. Get lost!


1476
02:30:48.495 --> 02:30:50.329
Marcello, what happened?

1477
02:30:50.497 --> 02:30:53.249
You'll see them later.
They're just hurt.


1478
02:30:53.417 --> 02:30:55.751
I promise you...
Will you stop that?


1479
02:30:55.919 --> 02:30:58.629
- Hurt? How?
- Go away!


1480
02:32:07.324 --> 02:32:11.118
Just drive through!
Break down the gate!


1481
02:32:11.328 --> 02:32:13.329
Out of the way!

1482
02:32:18.001 --> 02:32:21.754
It's all closed up.
All this way for nothing.


1483
02:32:24.424 --> 02:32:25.508
Wait.

1484
02:32:26.093 --> 02:32:27.885
Go on in, it's open.

1485
02:32:28.011 --> 02:32:31.806
What colors! It's beautiful!
Let's go inside.


1486
02:32:32.849 --> 02:32:34.600
Carlo!

1487
02:32:35.018 --> 02:32:36.811
Marcello's breaking in!

1488
02:32:36.937 --> 02:32:39.522
Watch out!
One, two, three!


1489
02:32:41.525 --> 02:32:44.986
To Nadia,
who's reclaimed her freedom...


1490
02:32:45.153 --> 02:32:47.530
to the annulment of her marriage...

1491
02:32:47.698 --> 02:32:50.783
to the annulment of her husband...
and of everything.


1492
02:32:50.909 --> 02:32:52.994
Thank you all.

1493
02:32:53.453 --> 02:32:56.831
This experience has
brought me back to my old friends


1494
02:32:56.957 --> 02:32:59.000
filled with every desire!

1495
02:32:59.126 --> 02:33:01.877
Like becoming a virgin again?

1496
02:33:02.045 --> 02:33:04.880
Yes. Annulment
is a marvelous sensation!


1497
02:33:05.048 --> 02:33:08.843
You have to be married first
to appreciate it. Right, darling?


1498
02:33:09.052 --> 02:33:11.721
- Lucia's confessing her sins.
- I want to hear.


1499
02:33:13.181 --> 02:33:14.432
Put on "Jingle Bells."

1500
02:33:14.683 --> 02:33:17.059
Are you two done confessing?

1501
02:33:17.185 --> 02:33:20.021
Making love in private
offends me today.


1502
02:33:20.731 --> 02:33:22.481
Here they are!

1503
02:33:24.234 --> 02:33:27.236
Don't make fun.
One is a senator's lover.


1504
02:33:29.156 --> 02:33:31.073
Wonderful!

1505
02:33:35.078 --> 02:33:37.038
Who invited them?

1506
02:33:38.290 --> 02:33:41.375
Someone's gonna murder those two
before Christmas.


1507
02:33:45.172 --> 02:33:49.717
Excuse me, but weren't you
once a serious writer?


1508
02:33:49.843 --> 02:33:53.262
I hereby announce
I've left journalism and literature.


1509
02:33:53.388 --> 02:33:56.766
I'm now a publicity agent,
I'm very happy to say.


1510
02:33:57.893 --> 02:34:01.854
A writer has to live,
but you write pure rubbish.


1511
02:34:02.064 --> 02:34:03.689
Listen to this:

1512
02:34:03.815 --> 02:34:05.900
"He has a Greek profile,

1513
02:34:06.026 --> 02:34:08.444
yet his contemporary look
reminds one


1514
02:34:08.612 --> 02:34:11.989
of today's most modern actor:
Paul Newman."


1515
02:34:12.532 --> 02:34:14.492
Marcello, you're a worm.
- Listen.


1516
02:34:15.118 --> 02:34:19.538
Why not admit you'd do anything
for an article about you?


1517
02:34:19.706 --> 02:34:21.707
You'd love me to write one.

1518
02:34:22.125 --> 02:34:24.710
Dear God!
You'd ruin my career!


1519
02:34:24.920 --> 02:34:29.465
If I paid you 50,000 more a month,
what would you write about me?


1520
02:34:30.050 --> 02:34:33.969
- That you're Marlon Brando.
- And for an extra 100,000?


1521
02:34:34.346 --> 02:34:36.847
- John Barrymore.
- And a million?


1522
02:34:37.683 --> 02:34:39.392
First give me the money.

1523
02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:46.482
You're terrible!
Take some lessons!


1524
02:34:48.318 --> 02:34:51.487
Hey, that's not funny!
He's hurt!


1525
02:34:51.822 --> 02:34:53.864
I saw you trip him!

1526
02:35:00.997 --> 02:35:03.999
You're a real asshole!
You invited us here.


1527
02:35:04.167 --> 02:35:07.753
Well, we're leaving.
Some party you'll have now!


1528
02:35:19.933 --> 02:35:23.269
I've never seen such boring people!

1529
02:35:23.437 --> 02:35:26.522
Our guest of honor is bored.
Let's entertain her.


1530
02:35:26.857 --> 02:35:29.316
You're right. Do a striptease.

1531
02:35:29.609 --> 02:35:31.944
Or isn't your intellectual's
chest sexy enough?


1532
02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:36.282
If you put on Persian music.
I can do a great striptease.


1533
02:35:36.408 --> 02:35:39.034
No, we've all seen you naked.

1534
02:35:39.161 --> 02:35:41.162
Oh, please!

1535
02:35:41.329 --> 02:35:45.916
I haven't seen you naked,
but I think the leopardess should do one.


1536
02:35:46.042 --> 02:35:49.003
Caterina will strip for us.

1537
02:35:49.129 --> 02:35:51.881
No, she's too professional!

1538
02:35:52.048 --> 02:35:53.841
Then I'll go eat my chicken.

1539
02:35:54.885 --> 02:35:56.635
If the party girl's bored,

1540
02:35:56.762 --> 02:35:59.513
why doesn't she do it?
- With pleasure.


1541
02:35:59.639 --> 02:36:02.057
Now we're talking!

1542
02:36:02.184 --> 02:36:05.895
Nadia, if you really do,
I'll quit smoking.


1543
02:36:06.021 --> 02:36:08.898
Put on "Patricia."
I'll turn off the lights.


1544
02:36:09.024 --> 02:36:10.983
Put on "Patricia."

1545
02:36:12.068 --> 02:36:16.071
Nadia will now perform
a striptease


1546
02:36:16.239 --> 02:36:18.407
to christen her new life.

1547
02:36:18.533 --> 02:36:21.452
- You have to set an example in life.
- It's idiotic!


1548
02:36:21.578 --> 02:36:24.538
- That's why I'm doing it.
- Here's your mink.


1549
02:36:45.101 --> 02:36:49.355
The guy'll be at your place
with the money in an hour.


1550
02:37:04.162 --> 02:37:06.455
At least not that I remember.

1551
02:37:08.333 --> 02:37:11.085
What did she say?
I don't understand.


1552
02:37:11.294 --> 02:37:14.463
She asked if you like me.

1553
02:37:27.102 --> 02:37:31.063
That's mine! Throw it here!

1554
02:37:32.482 --> 02:37:36.360
You got a great deal, Marcello.

1555
02:37:36.486 --> 02:37:39.613
It's a beautiful car. You'll see.

1556
02:37:39.739 --> 02:37:41.407
Help me.

1557
02:38:01.595 --> 02:38:05.097
Enough! Can't you see
you're not entertaining anyone?


1558
02:38:05.223 --> 02:38:08.350
Stop pestering me!
I'm enjoying myself.


1559
02:38:08.602 --> 02:38:12.521
You'll never go all the way.
You're shaking with fear.


1560
02:38:12.689 --> 02:38:16.525
Just stop now.
- No. You'll see.


1561
02:38:33.168 --> 02:38:36.211
You shouldn't
have taken your bra off first.


1562
02:38:36.338 --> 02:38:38.422
That should be second to last.

1563
02:38:38.548 --> 02:38:40.049
Right?

1564
02:38:42.385 --> 02:38:44.386
Wonderful!

1565
02:38:47.933 --> 02:38:50.267
No, don't take off your slip.

1566
02:38:50.393 --> 02:38:53.312
Cover up with the mink,
then peel off your slip.


1567
02:38:57.317 --> 02:38:59.401
Sorry, but I don't understand.

1568
02:39:08.578 --> 02:39:10.579
She's really going to do it.

1569
02:39:10.830 --> 02:39:12.331
Good for her.

1570
02:39:25.595 --> 02:39:28.097
Ruggero, are you serious?

1571
02:39:28.390 --> 02:39:31.517
Go on, party pooper.
You don't deserve her.


1572
02:39:35.105 --> 02:39:37.106
Nadia, take the fur off.

1573
02:39:38.108 --> 02:39:40.275
This is it, Nadia.

1574
02:39:40.568 --> 02:39:42.361
We want to see.

1575
02:39:44.572 --> 02:39:48.075
How did her husband
ever grant her a divorce?


1576
02:39:48.368 --> 02:39:50.285
Beautiful, isn't she?

1577
02:39:50.453 --> 02:39:53.205
Marvelous! A real dish!

1578
02:39:56.376 --> 02:39:58.168
Riccardo's coming!

1579
02:39:59.295 --> 02:40:01.839
The owner's here!

1580
02:40:03.967 --> 02:40:06.510
- You sons of bitches!
- Hi, Riccardo.


1581
02:40:06.636 --> 02:40:09.888
She just got divorced.
It's the least we can do.


1582
02:40:10.056 --> 02:40:13.976
I don't give a shit
about her divorce.


1583
02:40:14.602 --> 02:40:17.312
And I don't want
any gossip or publicity.


1584
02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:20.816
On the phone
you said we could come. Kiss.


1585
02:40:22.485 --> 02:40:25.320
What idiot broke the glass?

1586
02:40:26.656 --> 02:40:31.660
I'm leaving for Nice at 6:00 a.m.
I want you all out in half an hour


1587
02:40:31.828 --> 02:40:33.871
or I'm kicking you out.

1588
02:40:35.999 --> 02:40:38.751
I met her in Spoleto.
- Did you call that person?


1589
02:40:38.918 --> 02:40:42.004
No.
Guys, out in half an hour.


1590
02:40:42.130 --> 02:40:46.216
Who cares if you're leaving?
We're staying right here.


1591
02:40:46.342 --> 02:40:49.094
We're all friends.
Go if you want.


1592
02:40:49.220 --> 02:40:52.014
Mr. intellectual, entertain us.

1593
02:40:52.182 --> 02:40:54.349
I'll raise your salary.

1594
02:40:54.517 --> 02:40:56.727
Nadia was a good sport,

1595
02:40:56.853 --> 02:40:59.354
but her striptease
didn't get things going.


1596
02:40:59.522 --> 02:41:01.523
Come on, think up something!

1597
02:41:02.692 --> 02:41:06.361
I have a thousand ideas.
Two thousand!


1598
02:41:06.529 --> 02:41:11.450
I could keep you entertained for a week,
but you must do as I say.


1599
02:41:11.576 --> 02:41:12.785
Whatever you say.

1600
02:41:13.119 --> 02:41:16.997
First of all,
let's close the drapes.


1601
02:41:17.123 --> 02:41:20.209
Let's keep this nice intimacy going.

1602
02:41:20.376 --> 02:41:24.463
First, I propose our American dancer
make love with somebody.


1603
02:41:24.631 --> 02:41:26.298
Wonderful!

1604
02:41:26.716 --> 02:41:31.053
I bet you've never made love,
never had a man all to yourself.


1605
02:41:39.229 --> 02:41:42.189
- What's he doing?
- He's just drunk.


1606
02:41:42.732 --> 02:41:45.734
Pleased with your little number?
- What time is it?


1607
02:41:45.985 --> 02:41:50.697
Besides, it's a duty we have
toward our foreign visitor.


1608
02:41:51.199 --> 02:41:53.242
So I'll choose for you.

1609
02:41:53.409 --> 02:41:57.830
Tito will introduce you
to the delights of intercourse!


1610
02:41:57.956 --> 02:42:00.165
Come on, show some courage.

1611
02:42:00.291 --> 02:42:02.501
You take care of music.

1612
02:42:02.669 --> 02:42:06.088
Tito, take off your shirt.
- He's no man!


1613
02:42:06.256 --> 02:42:10.092
I've made a great choice for you.
Go on, make her a woman.


1614
02:42:10.260 --> 02:42:14.096
Meanwhile, our Tunisian beauty
will approach the lawyer,


1615
02:42:14.264 --> 02:42:16.598
who lives on his memories.

1616
02:42:16.891 --> 02:42:18.684
Anything goes!

1617
02:42:18.852 --> 02:42:20.435
We're leaving.

1618
02:42:20.603 --> 02:42:22.354
Thanks for the beautiful evening.

1619
02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:26.608
No, no one's leaving.
It's a long way till dawn.


1620
02:42:26.901 --> 02:42:30.779
You, half impotent
as an artist and as a man,


1621
02:42:30.947 --> 02:42:34.366
when the lights go out,
be brave and fulfill your desires!


1622
02:42:34.492 --> 02:42:35.701
All right.

1623
02:42:37.912 --> 02:42:40.664
You'll make love to Mariuccio.

1624
02:42:40.790 --> 02:42:43.041
Then Lisa...

1625
02:42:43.585 --> 02:42:48.005
who paints only to take
her models to bed...


1626
02:42:50.800 --> 02:42:52.968
Now you've done it.

1627
02:42:53.219 --> 02:42:57.306
Who do you think you're entertaining?
I'll kick you out on your ass.


1628
02:42:57.765 --> 02:43:01.143
Who invited you here?
What the hell are you doing?


1629
02:43:01.311 --> 02:43:03.562
I'm going to show you a good time.

1630
02:43:03.730 --> 02:43:05.564
This party mustn't end.

1631
02:43:05.690 --> 02:43:08.317
We'll all stay inside.
Someone might arrive.


1632
02:43:08.484 --> 02:43:11.486
Great joke!
That's a new one!


1633
02:43:13.573 --> 02:43:15.449
And you...

1634
02:43:17.118 --> 02:43:20.245
you're dying to make love with me

1635
02:43:20.371 --> 02:43:23.498
because you can't lure
anyone else into bed.


1636
02:43:23.625 --> 02:43:27.836
So you vent your frustration
with your pitiful songs...


1637
02:43:28.046 --> 02:43:30.923
I feel so sorry for you, Marcello.

1638
02:43:36.346 --> 02:43:38.513
That doesn't even happen

1639
02:43:38.681 --> 02:43:41.350
in Neapolitan melodramas!

1640
02:43:41.517 --> 02:43:44.686
You pig!
I won't put up with that!


1641
02:43:44.854 --> 02:43:46.855
Ask the lady for forgiveness.

1642
02:43:49.192 --> 02:43:52.861
I'd like to thank all my friends

1643
02:43:53.529 --> 02:43:56.990
for the beautiful career
they've given me.


1644
02:43:58.868 --> 02:44:01.370
I'd like to thank...

1645
02:44:01.829 --> 02:44:04.206
Who do you want to thank?

1646
02:44:04.832 --> 02:44:10.212
Ah, a nice chubby farm girl
from the mountains.


1647
02:44:10.338 --> 02:44:13.215
I bet you're from my region.
- Where are you from?


1648
02:44:13.383 --> 02:44:15.676
Come here. Get down.

1649
02:44:15.802 --> 02:44:18.345
Let's show this bunch
of impotent jerks


1650
02:44:18.471 --> 02:44:20.681
how strong you are!

1651
02:44:21.140 --> 02:44:23.976
You came to Rome
to try your luck, didn't you?


1652
02:44:24.143 --> 02:44:28.397
If you only knew
what rotten luck I've had...


1653
02:44:30.316 --> 02:44:33.193
What's the matter?

1654
02:44:33.319 --> 02:44:35.779
Are you sick? Wake up!

1655
02:44:35.905 --> 02:44:37.781
Open your eyes!

1656
02:44:41.703 --> 02:44:44.413
Andrea, start turning off the lights.

1657
02:44:45.999 --> 02:44:48.917
- What about those guarantees?
- I'm not signing anything.


1658
02:44:49.043 --> 02:44:53.547
- But I'm working on a movie.
- You already spent it all.


1659
02:44:53.840 --> 02:44:57.259
I'm not signing.
- The case has been postponed.


1660
02:45:02.140 --> 02:45:04.057
What's this music?

1661
02:45:07.395 --> 02:45:11.064
What are you laughing about?
Who turned off the lights?


1662
02:45:11.190 --> 02:45:14.109
- Can I get a ride?
- No, I'm not going to Rome.


1663
02:45:14.235 --> 02:45:16.111
Everybody out!

1664
02:45:22.702 --> 02:45:24.953
Darling, don't worry.

1665
02:45:25.079 --> 02:45:28.540
This medicine will help you.

1666
02:45:33.129 --> 02:45:37.632
...so I had to put the pool
at the foot of the stairs.


1667
02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:41.762
This girl's sick.
Take her out for some air.


1668
02:45:44.140 --> 02:45:47.267
- Get up!
- I'm sick.


1669
02:45:50.229 --> 02:45:52.856
Let's pretend you're a nice hen.

1670
02:45:52.982 --> 02:45:55.067
I don't wanna be a hen...

1671
02:45:55.485 --> 02:45:57.944
I bet you're from Fano.

1672
02:45:58.071 --> 02:46:00.364
What are you doing to her?

1673
02:46:08.748 --> 02:46:11.500
I really don't care

1674
02:46:11.626 --> 02:46:15.212
if you don't write that article.

1675
02:46:15.338 --> 02:46:19.007
God, the lies
you people tell here in Rome!


1676
02:46:19.467 --> 02:46:22.010
I'm not done with you yet.
Come here.


1677
02:46:22.178 --> 02:46:23.929
Raise your head.

1678
02:46:25.056 --> 02:46:27.140
Raise your head!

1679
02:46:34.399 --> 02:46:36.024
Idiot!

1680
02:46:45.368 --> 02:46:47.202
- Want to dance?
- Yes.


1681
02:46:48.663 --> 02:46:50.789
That's really a man's joke.

1682
02:46:50.998 --> 02:46:55.293
- Let's go find that painter.
- He moved to Riccione with his wife.


1683
02:46:55.461 --> 02:46:58.463
- Then let's hitchhike!
- No, I want to be alone.


1684
02:46:58.965 --> 02:47:02.092
I feel really down tonight.
- Me too.


1685
02:47:03.219 --> 02:47:05.387
- How do I look?
- Like a slut.


1686
02:47:12.895 --> 02:47:15.188
You were very cruel to Odette.

1687
02:47:15.314 --> 02:47:18.442
You know her?
I left her the apartment.


1688
02:47:18.818 --> 02:47:20.569
Who's that idiot?

1689
02:47:20.736 --> 02:47:22.779
My tummy hurts.

1690
02:47:24.407 --> 02:47:25.740
It's daybreak.

1691
02:47:26.909 --> 02:47:29.286
I thought it was 2:00 a.m.

1692
02:47:29.412 --> 02:47:32.622
My watch stopped.
What time is it?


1693
02:47:32.748 --> 02:47:34.332
5:15.

1694
02:47:34.584 --> 02:47:36.835
I have to be in court at 9:00.

1695
02:47:37.462 --> 02:47:41.256
- Can you drive me to Rome?
- I'm not going to Rome.


1696
02:47:41.424 --> 02:47:45.760
It was a nice party,
but that's enough now, you hear?


1697
02:47:47.221 --> 02:47:49.514
Enough... enough...

1698
02:47:52.977 --> 02:47:55.437
Where are my shoes?

1699
02:47:57.440 --> 02:47:58.899
Caterina!

1700
02:48:05.156 --> 02:48:07.532
Sondra and Daniela!

1701
02:48:15.791 --> 02:48:17.751
Paul Newman!

1702
02:48:21.464 --> 02:48:25.967
- Have a nice trip, Riccardo.
- Sorry I couldn't help you.


1703
02:48:36.312 --> 02:48:40.065
- And now, the beautiful Nadia.
- Shall we?


1704
02:48:43.486 --> 02:48:46.655
- Bye. I'll call you tomorrow.
- No, I'll call you.


1705
02:48:46.989 --> 02:48:50.242
Bye, Nadia, and congratulations!
- Thanks. Bye.


1706
02:48:50.368 --> 02:48:52.702
- Good luck to both of you.
- Thank you.


1707
02:48:54.664 --> 02:48:57.082
And now it's the lawyer's turn.

1708
02:48:57.667 --> 02:49:00.001
Grand finale with the lawyer.

1709
02:49:00.169 --> 02:49:02.921
Why don't you do a striptease?

1710
02:49:43.129 --> 02:49:45.005
What's down there?

1711
02:49:45.798 --> 02:49:47.090
Where?

1712
02:50:07.320 --> 02:50:08.987
Ah, nature!

1713
02:50:09.530 --> 02:50:12.866
Dawn always makes me so emotional.

1714
02:50:13.868 --> 02:50:18.246
I looked so good all made up,
but now I feel sticky.


1715
02:50:18.497 --> 02:50:22.751
But what do I care?
I'm quitting anyway.


1716
02:50:47.443 --> 02:50:51.112
But the more people retire,
the more others appear.


1717
02:50:53.282 --> 02:50:56.076
If two quit,
ten fill their places.


1718
02:50:56.619 --> 02:51:00.497
By 1965 there'll be total depravity.

1719
02:51:00.831 --> 02:51:04.042
How squalid everything will be!

1720
02:51:05.461 --> 02:51:07.879
Get back!

1721
02:51:14.011 --> 02:51:16.971
You'll make a fortune.
It's worth millions!


1722
02:51:17.723 --> 02:51:19.974
Guys, it's a monster!

1723
02:51:32.113 --> 02:51:34.072
My God!

1724
02:51:36.784 --> 02:51:38.493
It's alive!

1725
02:51:38.661 --> 02:51:40.787
It's been dead for two days.

1726
02:51:44.625 --> 02:51:47.752
- Is it male or female?
- What's it looking at?


1727
02:51:56.011 --> 02:51:57.971
Why don't we buy it?

1728
02:52:03.436 --> 02:52:07.772
Where did it come from?
Maybe Australia.


1729
02:52:07.940 --> 02:52:09.274
Why Australia?

1730
02:52:09.442 --> 02:52:11.776
You can't even tell
the front from the back.


1731
02:52:11.944 --> 02:52:13.903
Poor thing.

1732
02:52:17.533 --> 02:52:19.451
It just keeps staring.

1733
02:53:05.289 --> 02:53:07.749
I don't understand.
I can't hear you.


1734
02:53:28.896 --> 02:53:31.314
I can't hear you.

1735
02:53:39.824 --> 02:53:43.243
- Marcello, come on.
- I'm coming.
