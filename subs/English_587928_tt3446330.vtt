Now, some of us are able

Let me ask you a question.

29
00:02:57.377 --> 00:03:00.044
What was the last
great meal you had?


30
00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:01.978
Where did you have it?

31
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.948
Who did you have it with?

32
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.484
Well, depending on how
long ago you had this meal,


33
00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:09.220
you may not remember
all the details.


34
00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:11.322
But do you remember
the meal you had the next day


35
00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:13.257
or the day after that?

36
00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:14.928
Vaguely, perhaps, or not at all.

37
00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.361
The last time I stood
in front of this committee,


38
00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:20.997
I told you we were very
close to creating a nanobot


39
00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:22.567
that would enhance
the capabilities


40
00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.005
of the brain's
recall procedures.


41
00:03:26.605 --> 00:03:28.305
Ladies and gentlemen,

42
00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:32.409
I give you the advanced
memory enhancement nanobot.


43
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:35.346
Designed to apply itself
to the cells of the hippocampus,


44
00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:36.881
it acts like a light switch,

45
00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.448
turning on and off memories
as needed


46
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.419
by regulating a gene
known as TAT-1.


47
00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:46.424
Now, by programming sensory
detail into the nanobots,


48
00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:49.393
we can trace, pinpoint,
and actually recreate

based on data provided.

Let's let the doctors tell us.

There's been
tremendous progress.


330
00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:51.895
Thanks to Dr. Anderson,

331
00:18:51.897 --> 00:18:53.530
we now have the first
clear indication


332
00:18:53.532 --> 00:18:56.836
that my serum does indeed
prevent violent action.


333
00:18:58.402 --> 00:19:01.140
Do we have evidence
that can be demonstrated?


334
00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:06.543
With Dr. Anderson's
technology, yes.


335
00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:07.880
Hold on, now.

336
00:19:09.113 --> 00:19:11.214
This isn't conclusive.
And let's just be clear.


337
00:19:11.216 --> 00:19:14.216
We're talking about releasing
a convicted criminal, right?


338
00:19:14.218 --> 00:19:15.020
Eventually, yes.

339
00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.488
Which makes us that much more
responsible for our actions.


340
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:24.226
I mean, Simon is still
technically a violent case.


341
00:19:24.228 --> 00:19:26.062
Yes, but...

342
00:19:26.064 --> 00:19:27.797
Right. Well, you can trim a
hedge to keep it neat and tidy,


343
00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:30.167
but eventually it will
grow out of shape again.


344
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:32.034
Its roots are very
deep underground.


345
00:19:32.036 --> 00:19:35.004
Fortunately, hedges
can be retrimmed,


346
00:19:35.006 --> 00:19:38.510
but money, unfortunately,
does not grow on trees.


347
00:19:43.047 --> 00:19:44.380
Wouldn't you say that
the potential benefits


348
00:19:44.382 --> 00:19:45.815
far outweigh the negatives?

349
00:19:45.817 --> 00:19:47.283
This could essentially prove

350
00:19:47.285 --> 00:19:49.252
to be the end of violence
as we know it.


351
00:19:49.254 --> 00:19:50.523

divert our attention
to something like this.


522

of disassociation

These symptoms are not
simply born, but bred.

00:32:50.133 --> 00:32:52.834
And where do the
symptoms start?


526
00:32:52.836 --> 00:32:56.104
Usually the result
of a psychological trauma,

Edward's the trigger.

We can't assume
that Senator Frost

is intending to say


831
00:55:31.694 --> 00:55:35.362
is that they have acquired
some excellent data


832

matter of having it reconfirmed.

So, that looking through
past memories for answers


837
00:55:50.145 --> 00:55:53.214
was a complete waste of my time.

838
00:55:53.216 --> 00:55:55.482
I'm sure you'd
like to think so.

877

But my wife, she was
obsessed with ambition.


878
00:58:23.799 --> 00:58:25.068
Not hers, mine.

879

She was always telling me,
"You're better than that job."


880
00:58:28.638 --> 00:58:34.141
And what I called stable,
she called stagnant.

I really loved her.

But it...

885
00:58:49.558 --> 00:58:52.161
wasn't enough
to make her feel special.


886
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:57.732
So anyway, one day I came home

887
00:58:57.734 --> 00:58:59.933
and she was nagging at me
to meet the mayor.


888
00:58:59.935 --> 00:59:02.335
She was sitting
on some committee with him.


889
00:59:02.337 --> 00:59:05.639
And I thought, okay, why not?

890
00:59:05.641 --> 00:59:07.607
What have I got to lose?

891

Maybe it's time for a change.

892
00:59:10.446 --> 00:59:13.181
So the next morning
I got into my finest suit,


893
00:59:13.183 --> 00:59:14.748
didn't say a word to Susan,

894
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:17.884
and I headed down
to the mayor's office.

So I'm at the mayor's office
and he's not available.

So I figure I'll wait, you know,
catch him between appointments.

about an hour or so.

And...

900
00:59:35.605 --> 00:59:40.878
And then I think about how
proud it would make my wife.


901
00:59:43.779 --> 00:59:45.712
And then...

902
00:59:45.714 --> 00:59:47.250

dumbstruck to see the other one.

But I took advantage
of our situation.


907
01:00:07.904 --> 01:00:12.940
And that's where I learned
how power really works.


908
