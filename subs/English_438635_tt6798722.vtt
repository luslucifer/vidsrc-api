00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.480
Long before I launched Ashley
Madison there were affairs,


2
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.120
and long after I'm gone
there'll be affairs


3
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.640
and so what I'm just
trying to do is help people


4
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.600
have the most perfect affair.

9
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.880
They made it sound like it was this
play land of people hooking up...


10
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.320
...it had glamour, sex and crime,

11

hacking and danger.
It had everything.


12
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.600

26
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.400
I'm not necessarily
encouraging infidelity


27
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.040
I don't think it needs
that much encouragement.


28

How are you not
encouraging infidelity?


29
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.760

33
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.520
I see it as a platform that
helps people stay married,


34
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.440
they help millions of
people find contentment,

passion and happiness.

Noel said that society
was changing,


37
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.160
the model of relationships
that we have from the past


38
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.600
and at the moment
isn't working.


39
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.600
A lot of people are
having affairs and


40
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.360
it's all done behind
people's backs.


41
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.080
It's destructive for families.

42
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.720
And they said that they were leading
the way in helping with this.

47
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.760
The big attraction to it
was that it's a hookup,


48
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.080
it's not a date. There
isn't any of the risk,

you know, everybody
knows where they stand.

geared towards sort of the,


51
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.680
as I like to say, the afternoon
delight, kind of situation.


52

Kind of a quick hook
up kind of site.

[voice-over] <i>Like any dating site, users</i>

62
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.160
Initially, you know, men are very hesitant
to make the first move.


63
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.920
When we start talking
that's the first thing.


64
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.480
They want to find out, are you real?

65
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.560
Do you really live in the United States?

66
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.400
[Christopher] And that's when I would
start getting emails saying


67
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.200
that this woman checked
out your profile,


68
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.480
she wants to talk to you, this
person's interested in you.


69
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.400
And because if you
didn't have a paid account,


70
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.800
you hadn't bought the credits,

71
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.520
you couldn't see the actual
pictures of the profiles


72
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.840
they were all blurred.

73
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.320
[voice-over] <i>Men had to buy credits</i>

74

<i>in order to reply to messages</i>
<i>sent to them.</i>


75
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.960
And then once you start talking,
inevitably for some strange reason,


76
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.000
men have this insatiable desire
to send you dick pictures.


77
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.680
Pictures of their penises. Sometimes
it's even the first picture.


78
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.360
I don't even know what
their face looks like.


79
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.880
Okay.

80
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.640
People have affairs and cheat
for a lot of different reasons,


81
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.360
it's not always just physical.

82
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.160
We all like to think it's
that but in reality even men


83
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.680
the vast majority are seeking out an
affair for emotional reasons as well.


84
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.440
I did meet and talk
to quite a few men,

93

It's always happened,
it's on an increase.

<i>It wasn't in the workplace.</i>

98

<i>It wasn't with close</i>
<i>friends of the family.</i>


99

I got that concept.

100

It's less damaging,
people's needs get met.

to be to be able to take anything,

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:33.920
I had contact with probably
around 200 profiles

<i>But the idea that bots</i>


298
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:48.640
<i>and fake profiles were on the pages</i>

<i>consumer attorney Fillippo Marchino</i>


299
00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.760

<i>on behalf of disgruntled users.</i>

301
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.480
One of the first things we
did is we pulled the terms


302
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.960
and conditions off of the
website of Ashley Madison


303
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.600
and buried in the middle
was a couple of sentences


304
00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.880
that read something
to the extent of


305
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.280
"this is only an
entertainment website,


306

you may be responding
or contacted by robots"


307
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.080
and that just did
not sound right


308
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.560
because people were not
engaging AshleyMadison.com

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.720
you're almost immediately
converting into a member.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.440
[voice-over] <i>It was another major</i>
<i>marketing success for Noel Biderman.</i>


581
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.160
[female voice] <i>Why do you think Noel</i>
<i>was so clever at this?</i>


582
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.760
Speaking as an entrepreneur
myself most entrepreneurs


583
00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.880
when they come up with an idea

584
00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.640
it's because they saw a market need
for something that they needed.


585
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.400
Most entrepreneurs
won't just like:


586
00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.360
"Oh, people need this but
I don't really want it."


587
00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.680
Most entrepreneurs when
they start something


588
00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.920
they want the product that's
why they are making it.


589
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.920
So I can only imagine that he might have
wanted to have some sort of affair,


590
00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.440
or make it easier
to have affairs.


591
00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.680
And that's quite brilliant that he went
to the market


592
00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:47.960
being like ''I don't have affair,

593
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:52.080
I'm happily married blah blah, I just
like start this for other guys.''


594
00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.560
If your husband was
cheating on you,


595
00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.640
would you be OK with him going
to a site such as yours?


596
00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.160
Absolutely not, that's not
what I signed up for.


597
00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.640
[voice-over] <i>Noel was the master</i>
<i>of press interviews.</i>


598
00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.880
<i>He often included his</i>
<i>wife in the discussion.</i>


599
00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.640
And I live in a traditional
situation with Noel and...


600
00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.960
<i>And he was always clear: he had</i>
<i>never had an extra-marital affair.</i>


601
00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.280
And I would be devastated
if he did this to me.


602
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.920
<i>But information released</i>
<i>in the Ashley Madison hack</i>


603
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.560
<i>revealed that Noel</i>
<i>did have affairs,</i>


604
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.960
<i>in fact, it appeared</i>
<i>that over three years</i>


605
00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.320
<i>he had had relationships</i>
<i>with a number of women,</i>


606
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.200
<i>many of whom he had met through</i>
<i>his own site, Established Men.</i>


607
00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.600
<i>Noel frequently discussed</i>
<i>money with these women</i>


608
00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.240
<i>and even offered one</i>
<i>work at Avid Life.</i>


609
00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.520
<i>He appears to have been</i>
<i>a serial sugar daddy himself.</i>


610
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:45.960
<i>It seems that very little of the Ashley</i>
<i>Madison story was as it appeared.</i>


611
00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.280
<i>It's hard to know if the mainstream</i>
<i>media would have given Noel</i>


612
00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.520
<i>and his company quite</i>
<i>so much airtime</i>


613
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.080
<i>if they'd known all that was</i>
<i>happening behind the scenes.</i>


614
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.800
[Gina] <i>I don't think Ashley Madison</i>
<i>is inventing prostitution.</i>


615
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:05.160
I think what the emails suggest they're
doing is helping to automate it.


616
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.320
And making it very easy.

617
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.520
Just like Google didn't
invent looking stuff up.


618
00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.320
<i>To my knowledge, Ashley Madison,</i>
<i>they're not running a prostitution ring</i>


619
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.840
<i>or their own escort service that's</i>
<i>against the law or anything like that.</i>


620
00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.000
What I find more immoral
is about the way


621
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.360
they deal with reporters
and journalists,


622
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.960
misleading them into thinking that the
company is something that it isn't.


623
00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.320
But that's not illegal either.

624
00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.560
Because they're
a private company


625
00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.560
and they can tell people anything
they want to about their business.


626
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.040
I think Ashley Madison were
brilliant at marketing


627
00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.120
they seemed to know
what the papers wanted.


628
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.640
And they would take this
little seed of truth,


629
00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:49.840
blow it up and that was probably what
made them so successful in the media.


630
00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.880
You need to get a little bit more
with times, and to be honest...

When I first agreed to
be their spokesperson,


639

it was very much me coming from
an authentic point of view,

about my beliefs about my experience of
working with couples who had affairs.

A lot of that kind of got ditched

<i>and escort listings with the</i>
<i>blanket of Ashley Madison.</i>


677
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:28.240
Because Noel was so good at
making it look mainstream and OK,


678
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.040
and commonplace and
OK to talk about,


679
00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.480
I think people were more likely
to be able to talk openly


680

than they are about PornHub.com.

I mean with nobody
really questioning,


686
