<i>-Okay.</i>


510

<i>But marriage forced us</i>
<i>to really think about it</i>

00:22:39.111 --> 00:22:40.987
<i>and now, with time,</i>

513
00:22:41.071 --> 00:22:45.826

00:37:04.642 --> 00:37:05.476
<i>Yeah?</i>

845
00:37:06.477 --> 00:37:09.689
<i>My whole thing is that I don't want</i>
<i>my religion to stop me from experiences.</i>


846
00:37:09.772 --> 00:37:10.606
<i>No, that makes sense.</i>

847
00:37:11.357 --> 00:37:13.401
<i>[Dani]</i>I try to do what I can,

848
00:37:13.484 --> 00:37:15.653
<i>but I also think</i>
<i>that everyone's level of Judaism</i>


849
00:37:15.736 --> 00:37:17.571
<i>is, like, what they're comfortable with,</i>

850
00:37:17.655 --> 00:37:20.032
<i>and, like, it's all okay, you know.</i>

851
00:37:20.116 --> 00:37:22.159
<i>God is going to
accept us at all levels.</i>

852
00:37:22.243 --> 00:37:25.246
<i>What would you say is the difference</i>
<i>between Sephardic culture</i>


853
00:37:25.329 --> 00:37:26.455
<i>and Ashkenazi culture?</i>

854
00:37:26.539 --> 00:37:28.874
<i>Um… You know, 
Sephardic's, like, really…</i>

855
00:37:28.958 --> 00:37:31.794
<i>you know, we're all very influenced</i>
<i>by the Middle Eastern countries.</i>


856
00:37:31.877 --> 00:37:34.755
<i>The food is super different.</i>
<i>It's Middle Eastern.</i>


857
00:37:34.839 --> 00:37:37.425
<i>Even personality types,</i>
<i>it's a little different.</i>


858
00:37:37.508 --> 00:37:40.761
<i>You're gonna get</i>
<i>a bit more spice with Sephardi guys.</i>


859
00:37:40.845 --> 00:37:43.723
<i>Dating is a little different.</i>
<i>The girls are a bit more traditional.</i>


860
00:37:43.806 --> 00:37:48.769
<i>Do you know why</i>
<i>you can eat rice on Passover, but I can't?</i>


861
00:37:48.853 --> 00:37:50.938
<i>-I can't tell you the specific rules.</i>
<i>-You don't know.</i>


862
00:37:51.022 --> 00:37:54.025
<i>-Couldn't tell you why. I'll ask my rabbi.</i>
<i>-So what happens when…</i>


863
00:37:54.108 --> 00:37:56.027
<i>-If we were to get married…</i>
<i>-You'll eat rice.</i>


864
00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:57.320
<i>Am I allowed to eat rice?</i>

865
00:37:57.403 --> 00:38:00.906
<i>It goes by the guy, so if I'm Sephardi,</i>
<i>the whole family becomes Sephardi.</i>


866
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:02.158
<i>Interesting.</i>

867
00:38:02.241 --> 00:38:06.579
<i>So, if we actually become a thing,</i>
<i>then you'll lead a Sephardic lifestyle.</i>


868
00:38:07.204 --> 00:38:09.248
<i>-Are you okay with that or no?</i>
<i>-Yeah. Fine.</i>


869
00:38:09.957 --> 00:38:11.417
<i>But what if you get sick of me?</i>

870
00:38:12.376 --> 00:38:14.545
<i>Then we'll be friends.</i>
<i>I'll settle for friends.</i>


871
00:38:14.628 --> 00:38:17.298
<i>-We can do that.</i>
<i>-You don't have to be dating every girl.</i>


872
00:38:17.381 --> 00:38:19.467
<i>If it's not meant to be,</i>
<i>it's not meant to be.</i>


873
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:20.885
<i>But you wanna be my friend?</i>

874
00:38:23.554 --> 00:38:25.765
<i>No. I want more than that.</i>
