1
00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:39.304
The mind holds onto painful
memories for a reason...


2
00:01:39.383 --> 00:01:43.104
trying to keep us from making the
same mistakes over and over.


3
00:01:43.178 --> 00:01:45.806
Some say if you go back to where
a painful memory started...


4
00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:51.146
look at the place, walk through it,
you can get free of the hurt and forget.


5
00:01:52.854 --> 00:01:55.357
Maybe I thought that would happen.

6
00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.742
I'll tell you though, it would
have been all right with me...


7
00:01:57.818 --> 00:02:00.287
if I never saw this town again.

8
00:02:00.362 --> 00:02:05.539
But it was the only teaching job I could
get, and I needed it, and I took it.


9
00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:09.455
Oh, Jim, it's lovely.

10
00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.007
Pretty good, huh?

11
00:02:13.542 --> 00:02:15.215
- Looks boring.
- No.


12
00:02:15.294 --> 00:02:19.674
Oh, come on, you're gonna love it.
It's much better than Chicago.


13
00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.722
Of course, things had changed...

14
00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:25.725
but not much, considering
the years that had passed.


15
00:02:25.804 --> 00:02:28.899
No, not nearly enough to keep
my heart from tightening...


16
00:02:28.974 --> 00:02:33.104
to keep me from forgetting that this was
the town where my brother had died.


17
00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:37.316
The same town my parents fled in
fear and grief when I was nine.


18
00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:41.199
The same. Only the
faces had changed.


19
00:02:46.992 --> 00:02:51.122
Sixteen forty-seven, that's
what it said? Are you sure?


20
00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:54.879
- Sixteen forty-seven Harland.
- Okay.


21
00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.225
- Hey, where are all the sidewalks?
- That's the least of our problems.


22
00:03:22.611 --> 00:03:24.784
Well, we don't have to stay.
I'll go back to house painting.


23
00:03:24.863 --> 00:03:26.383
I can start with this
shack right here.


24
00:03:26.448 --> 00:03:29.247
No way. You are not a
house painter anymore.


25
00:03:29.326 --> 00:03:31.249
Well, I might not be much of
a teacher either, you know.


26
00:03:31.328 --> 00:03:33.837
Might be a little rusty
after this layoff.


27
00:03:33.863 --> 00:03:36.780
You'll be fine. It's
just like riding a bike.


28
00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:40.588
- You never give up on me, do you?
- Nope. Never.


29
00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:47.929
Okay, two guys with a truck, come on.
Let's unload this van.


30
00:03:49.221 --> 00:03:51.565
Scott could tell that
Sally and I were afraid.


31
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.689
How many years had I worked and
what did we have to show for it?


32
00:03:54.768 --> 00:03:57.612
I wanted to provide for
him, not put him in danger.


33
00:03:57.688 --> 00:03:59.736
- Good night, pumpkin.
- Good night, Mom.


34
00:03:59.815 --> 00:04:01.909
- Sleep well.
- Okay.


35
00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.617
- Good night, kiddo.
- Good night, Dad.


36
00:04:05.696 --> 00:04:07.414
Good night.

37
00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:12.912
- What do you think, on or off?
- Off.


38
00:04:12.994 --> 00:04:15.088
- Sure?
- Yeah.


39
00:04:17.124 --> 00:04:19.297
- Good night.
- Good night.


40
00:04:26.508 --> 00:04:30.138
I have a certain way of
breaking in a new house.


41
00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:38.195
I have to establish my territory.

42
00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:46.745
If I had known the
horror we were facing...


43
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.745
I would have taken Sally and Scott in
my arms like my parents took me...


44
00:04:50.824 --> 00:04:53.703
and run from this town forever.

45
00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:04.763
I hear this new teacher threw
some kid out a window in Chicago.


46
00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:08.888
- No, man, he ran him over with his car.
- No, no, that's not what happened.


47
00:05:08.967 --> 00:05:11.345
The guy got fired because
he went berserk in class.


48
00:05:11.428 --> 00:05:13.556
He picked up a chair and threw...

49
00:05:23.565 --> 00:05:26.114
My fifth class today.

50
00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:30.414
I'm a little out of shape.
Thank God you're seniors.


51
00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:32.366
You'll have mercy on me, I hope.

52
00:05:37.454 --> 00:05:41.254
- So I'll do my best to keep you awake.
- We'd rather sleep.


53
00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:48.386
Well, I can tell this is
not love at first sight...


54
00:05:48.465 --> 00:05:51.890
but you got to live with me and
I got to live with you, so...


55
00:05:51.968 --> 00:05:54.517
let's try to enjoy it, okay?

56
00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:59.564
May I?

57
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.109
There's something you should
know about this class.


58
00:06:03.188 --> 00:06:05.782
- Do you have a name?
- Yeah.


59
00:06:06.691 --> 00:06:09.160
- Do you wanna tell it to me?
- Chip Conway.


60
00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:13.161
Or the Chipster depending
on how close you get.


61
00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:17.624
Now, you see, Mr. Jim, sir,
there's a little...


62
00:06:17.702 --> 00:06:20.626
Hold it. It's Mr. Norman
or just Jim.


63
00:06:20.705 --> 00:06:24.926
Yeah, that's what I said.
This isn't a real class.


64
00:06:25.001 --> 00:06:27.299
You see, most of us in here
are on the football team.


65
00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:32.636
It's a special class for jocks
like me and airhead chicks.


66
00:06:33.844 --> 00:06:35.562
Like Kate.

67
00:06:37.472 --> 00:06:40.692
- I'm not an airhead.
- Yeah, right!


68
00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:44.863
Now, let us cruise and we'll
win you a championship.


69
00:06:44.938 --> 00:06:49.159
Pass us and you'll have one
happy squad of killer stompers.


70
00:06:49.234 --> 00:06:51.362
Yeah! Yeah!

71
00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:54.869
You'll pass, if you do the work.

72
00:06:54.948 --> 00:06:57.246
Pass us anyway.

73
00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:09.300
All right, let's just keep it down.
Hold it down. Hey!


74
00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:11.799
Hey!

75
00:07:12.757 --> 00:07:14.384
Shut up!

76
00:07:18.179 --> 00:07:22.184
- Sorry.
- No, really, don't be sorry.


77
00:07:23.143 --> 00:07:26.693
I want to apologize for
the jerks in this class.


78
00:07:26.771 --> 00:07:31.402
- Some of us really wanna learn stuff.
- Thank you... Kate? Thank you.


79
00:07:36.114 --> 00:07:38.788
But I do wanna apologize.

80
00:07:39.534 --> 00:07:43.129
I'm just... I'm a little rusty
at this teaching, and...


81
00:07:43.914 --> 00:07:48.294
- I won't be breaking any more sticks.
- I kind of liked it.


82
00:07:50.921 --> 00:07:54.095
I don't know, Mr. Simmons. This guy's
coming down really hard on us.


83
00:07:54.174 --> 00:07:56.848
- We've got a big responsibility...
- Just a moment.


84
00:07:56.927 --> 00:07:59.646
- Mr. Norman.
- Hello, sir.


85
00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:03.942
- So, how was your first day?
- Well, it was fine, sir. Just fine.


86
00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:08.363
Good. If you have a minute,
I'd like to have a quick chat.


87
00:08:08.438 --> 00:08:11.066
- Sure.
- In my office.


88
00:08:14.653 --> 00:08:16.405
Excuse me.

89
00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:28.964
In 27 years, no one had moved
in after my parents and I left.


90
00:08:29.042 --> 00:08:32.842
What was it about this house
that kept them away?


91
00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:47.478
I'm gonna get you, Jimmy.

92
00:08:55.986 --> 00:08:57.909
Got you now.

93
00:08:58.405 --> 00:09:03.787
No, Wayne. Wayne...
Stop, Wayne! Wayne!


94
00:09:06.621 --> 00:09:09.841
Wayne, no. No, Wayne. Wayne, no.

95
00:09:11.793 --> 00:09:13.545
Wayne!

96
00:09:14.504 --> 00:09:16.723
Run, Jimmy, run!

97
00:09:25.974 --> 00:09:28.397
Sally? Scott?

98
00:09:30.687 --> 00:09:32.781
Surprise!

99
00:09:33.231 --> 00:09:35.905
- Hey, it's enough.
- Look!


100
00:09:36.526 --> 00:09:40.622
- Where did you get this?
- You are married to a very clever woman.


101
00:09:40.697 --> 00:09:44.918
You know, this place really has
potential in a bohemian sort of way.


102
00:09:44.993 --> 00:09:48.839
- We went to the thrift store.
- Don't tell him that, Scott.


103
00:09:48.913 --> 00:09:51.792
I spent a tiny bit of Christmas
money, but it's nice, isn't it?


104
00:09:51.875 --> 00:09:55.425
- It's great.
- And, look, I got this. It's an antique.


105
00:09:55.503 --> 00:09:57.972
Wait a minute,
I'll show you the rest.


106
00:09:58.048 --> 00:10:00.096
I saw the perfect place
downtown today.


107
00:10:00.175 --> 00:10:02.598
Honey, this isn't Chicago.
There is no downtown here.


108
00:10:02.677 --> 00:10:05.396
Well, you know what I mean,
over there in the center of town.


109
00:10:05.472 --> 00:10:07.895
It's a vacant store front.
It's perfect for the shop.


110
00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:09.066
Sounds great.

111
00:10:09.142 --> 00:10:11.645
And I've decided, I'm not
gonna do just flowers.


112
00:10:11.728 --> 00:10:16.074
You know, I think in a place like
this, you can't be so specific.


113
00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:19.699
- Are you okay?
- Yes. I'm all right.


114
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.415
I'm really excited about this place.
I think it's a perfect location.


115
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:24.992
Can I have my train back?

116
00:10:25.075 --> 00:10:26.952
Yep. Why don't you go get the
mitts and we'll play some ball?


117
00:10:27.035 --> 00:10:29.333
- So how was work?
- It was all right.


118
00:10:29.412 --> 00:10:33.087
The principal called me
into his office today.


119
00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:36.045
Said he didn't want a
Chicago incident here...


120
00:10:36.127 --> 00:10:37.845
that I should watch my anger.

121
00:10:37.921 --> 00:10:40.515
I thought you cleared that
up at the first interview.


122
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.969
Well, I think he just wants
me to know he's watching.


123
00:10:44.052 --> 00:10:49.650
And the students seem to know, too.
I hope the stories don't get out of hand.


124
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.227
Come on, Dad!

125
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.108
Coming! We won't be long.

126
00:10:54.187 --> 00:10:58.317
Yeah, well, don't be long.
Dinner's almost ready.


127
00:11:48.533 --> 00:11:50.080
Sally?

128
00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:52.624
Sally?

129
00:13:04.108 --> 00:13:08.079
You gonna be here for a minute?
You go... Wait a minute.


130
00:13:11.115 --> 00:13:12.833
We're ready.

131
00:13:13.368 --> 00:13:15.621
Yes. Yes.

132
00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:19.340
Does he sing? No.

133
00:13:21.417 --> 00:13:23.715
Does he dance? No.

134
00:13:29.634 --> 00:13:32.638
Oh, honey, stop.

135
00:13:38.726 --> 00:13:40.524
You're awful.

136
00:13:41.938 --> 00:13:43.815
I don't know.

137
00:13:44.857 --> 00:13:46.575
No way.

138
00:14:15.471 --> 00:14:16.347
Jimmy?

139
00:14:19.017 --> 00:14:20.564
Hey.

140
00:14:21.686 --> 00:14:24.940
- Hey, what's eating you?
- Why can't I go to the library with you?


141
00:14:25.023 --> 00:14:26.900
- Who said you can't?
- Mom.


142
00:14:26.983 --> 00:14:30.829
Yeah? Well, I just talked to mom
and I worked everything out.


143
00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:33.247
If you wanna go, you can go,
but you got to carry my books.


144
00:14:33.323 --> 00:14:35.121
Okay-

145
00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:43.712
You and me, Jimmy, we're
always gonna stick together.


146
00:14:45.168 --> 00:14:48.638
I got to pay my library fine,
so I'm gonna need your help.


147
00:14:48.713 --> 00:14:52.388
How much is three
times two, times two?


148
00:14:52.467 --> 00:14:54.561
It's 12.

149
00:14:55.386 --> 00:14:58.060
You're the one who's got
the brains in this family.


150
00:14:58.139 --> 00:15:00.141
Here you go.

151
00:15:15.948 --> 00:15:17.575
Yay!

152
00:15:23.164 --> 00:15:29.217
- We're gonna go through the tunnel?
- Sure. It's faster. Come on.


153
00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:36.681
No!

154
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.597
Wayne!

155
00:15:40.973 --> 00:15:44.853
Don't!

156
00:16:00.493 --> 00:16:03.872
Hey, buttface,
you're blocking the road.


157
00:16:06.707 --> 00:16:11.053
Sissies with books.
Read me a story, sissy.


158
00:16:43.536 --> 00:16:46.255
Do you wanna get through
this tunnel, kid?


159
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.458
You're gonna have to pay.

160
00:16:48.541 --> 00:16:51.340
- We'll go back.
- "We'll go back."


161
00:16:53.421 --> 00:16:56.766
Nope. No other way except our way.

162
00:16:57.467 --> 00:16:59.310
Right, Vinnie?

163
00:17:00.887 --> 00:17:03.231
- So give us some money.
- Leave us alone.


164
00:17:03.306 --> 00:17:07.356
Hey, look, new sneakers.
Let's see if they can fly.


165
00:17:25.077 --> 00:17:27.000
Can they ﬂy?

166
00:17:33.753 --> 00:17:37.849
Now, I'm gonna ask
you one more time.


167
00:17:39.133 --> 00:17:41.511
- How much money you got?
- Twelve cents.


168
00:17:41.594 --> 00:17:43.221
Leave my brother alone!

169
00:17:45.306 --> 00:17:49.277
Vinnie, get this little baby
away from me before I smack him.


170
00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:53.739
Whoa!

171
00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:03.416
Nobody hits me and lives, man.

172
00:18:05.243 --> 00:18:08.417
- Hey, come on, guys.
- Wayne!


173
00:18:09.163 --> 00:18:11.165
Run, Jimmy, run!

174
00:18:11.832 --> 00:18:13.834
Heads up, Vinnie.

175
00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:23.811
Run, Jimmy, run!

176
00:18:31.143 --> 00:18:34.738
He deserved it, man.
You had that coming.


177
00:18:34.814 --> 00:18:38.239
- He had it coming!
- What about him?


178
00:18:38.317 --> 00:18:41.662
- What if he tells somebody?
- Come here, kid.


179
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.782
Let's go! Let's go!

180
00:18:45.825 --> 00:18:48.954
- Let's go! Let's go! Hand me the keys!
- No! No!


181
00:18:49.912 --> 00:18:54.383
- Wayne!
- Get help. Get help. Run!


182
00:18:54.458 --> 00:18:56.631
- Where's the key?
- Find the key!


183
00:18:56.711 --> 00:18:59.806
- Okay, let's go!
- Hey, kid!


184
00:19:00.548 --> 00:19:01.891
Mueller!

185
00:19:01.966 --> 00:19:04.344
- You coward!
- Mueller!


186
00:19:26.782 --> 00:19:29.535
Jimmy, what's wrong?

187
00:19:38.002 --> 00:19:40.505
No! Wayne...

188
00:19:43.591 --> 00:19:45.264
Jim?

189
00:19:54.393 --> 00:19:55.940
Jim.

190
00:19:59.607 --> 00:20:01.530
Are you all right?

191
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.703
Yeah.

192
00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:08.616
I thought I heard a child crying.

193
00:20:11.786 --> 00:20:15.040
It was... It was me.

194
00:20:17.124 --> 00:20:21.129
Why don't you come on inside?
I'll fix you a cup of coffee.


195
00:20:22.463 --> 00:20:24.056
Yeah.

196
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.888
In a minute.

197
00:20:41.107 --> 00:20:43.109
Run, Jimmy, run!

198
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.529
You told Coach I had an F coming?
He suspended me!


199
00:21:20.604 --> 00:21:22.572
Well, maybe the message will
get through to you, Chip!


200
00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:25.117
You get an F on your midterm,
the Coach is gonna cut you from the team.


201
00:21:25.192 --> 00:21:26.944
If you give me one more F,
I swear to God, I'm gonna...


202
00:21:27.027 --> 00:21:28.904
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

203
00:21:29.697 --> 00:21:33.668
Look, Chip, I played football, too,
and I did my school work.


204
00:21:33.743 --> 00:21:38.214
Now, you're a smart guy.
You wanna play, just do the work.


205
00:21:40.708 --> 00:21:43.302
You gonna take that, dude?

206
00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.892
You're dead, man!

207
00:21:57.975 --> 00:21:59.568
You.

208
00:22:02.021 --> 00:22:04.274
Come on. Come on.

209
00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.504
What were you and Chip talking about?
He looked pretty mad.


210
00:22:22.583 --> 00:22:26.087
Oh, no, no, we...
We were just talking.


211
00:22:30.591 --> 00:22:32.559
What is it?

212
00:22:37.973 --> 00:22:42.570
I don't know. Mr. Norman, Jim...

213
00:22:43.604 --> 00:22:47.325
You know how you're saying
that history repeats itself?


214
00:22:47.399 --> 00:22:52.200
I've been thinking a lot about that,
and that really bothers me.


215
00:22:52.279 --> 00:22:55.078
- Why is that?
- I don't know.


216
00:22:55.157 --> 00:22:58.536
Does it have to be the same
story repeated over again?


217
00:22:58.619 --> 00:23:02.874
- I mean, can't we change anything?
- Well, people can change things.


218
00:23:02.957 --> 00:23:05.130
I think that's what makes
a person great is...


219
00:23:05.209 --> 00:23:09.134
guts and the ability to
change the patterns.


220
00:23:10.256 --> 00:23:14.762
I was listening to that "Dust
in the Wind" song last night.


221
00:23:14.844 --> 00:23:16.346
I don't know.

222
00:23:17.137 --> 00:23:21.392
I just don't wanna end up a piece
of dust in someone's eye, you know?


223
00:23:22.226 --> 00:23:24.570
Well, I don't think that's
all you'll be, Billy.


224
00:23:24.645 --> 00:23:27.819
'Cause, you're learning how to think.
That's a good sign.


225
00:23:37.449 --> 00:23:41.124
Hey, do I get extra
credit for thinking?


226
00:23:55.885 --> 00:23:59.355
Billy? Your wallet! Billy?

227
00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:54.652
What are you doing, man?

228
00:24:55.235 --> 00:24:56.031
Come on!

229
00:25:00.491 --> 00:25:01.538
Hey.

230
00:25:04.119 --> 00:25:04.790
Hey!

231
00:25:10.668 --> 00:25:12.261
Come on!

232
00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:14.258
Stop!

233
00:25:16.048 --> 00:25:18.346
What are you guys doing?

234
00:25:18.425 --> 00:25:20.974
Help me! Help me!

235
00:25:22.137 --> 00:25:23.935
Help me!

236
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:31.280
Billy! Billy!

237
00:25:47.705 --> 00:25:49.298
Billy!

238
00:25:53.335 --> 00:25:55.429
Oh no... oh no...

239
00:26:06.598 --> 00:26:10.819
You have a new student, period seven,
name's Lawson, Richard Lawson.


240
00:26:10.894 --> 00:26:15.946
He's a transfer from Milford.
You have the room unfortunately.


241
00:26:16.025 --> 00:26:18.119
He can take Billy Stearns' seat.

242
00:26:18.193 --> 00:26:23.575
Mr. Simmons, Billy Stearns was murdered.
I saw it. That car ran him off the road.


243
00:26:26.285 --> 00:26:30.665
No one there saw any
other car but yours.


244
00:26:30.748 --> 00:26:32.591
Just yours.

245
00:26:33.917 --> 00:26:36.591
I don't know what to tell you.

246
00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.733
Okay, guys, let's sit down.

247
00:26:54.313 --> 00:26:56.407
Chip, take a seat.

248
00:26:56.482 --> 00:26:59.406
- What's that, an order?
- No, it's a suggestion.


249
00:26:59.485 --> 00:27:03.115
You could take a seat or you
can go talk to Coach about it.


250
00:27:03.197 --> 00:27:04.790
Okay-

251
00:27:04.865 --> 00:27:06.492
Let's sit down.

252
00:27:07.284 --> 00:27:09.787
Heather, I haven't forgotten
that report you owe me.


253
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.747
Okay, all right.

254
00:27:13.248 --> 00:27:15.546
Are you Richard Lawson?

255
00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.383
Live and in person, Mr. Norman.

256
00:27:19.463 --> 00:27:23.434
Just came up from Milford.
Real glad to be here, sir.


257
00:27:31.475 --> 00:27:34.979
One thing you have to know,
in my class, no cigarettes.


258
00:27:36.355 --> 00:27:38.983
No problem, Mr. Norman.

259
00:27:39.858 --> 00:27:42.782
I wouldn't want to do
anything to upset you, sir.


260
00:27:48.158 --> 00:27:49.831
Take a seat.

261
00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:53.335
I can't wait for you to start
teaching me, Mr. Norman.


262
00:27:53.413 --> 00:27:55.632
I hunger for knowledge.

263
00:28:06.468 --> 00:28:11.144
I know we're all pretty upset
about Billy Stearns' death.


264
00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:15.069
So if...

265
00:28:16.395 --> 00:28:19.615
If any of you have anything you
wanna talk about or say...


266
00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:21.909
now's the time to do it.

267
00:28:29.992 --> 00:28:31.790
Mr. Lawson.

268
00:28:33.078 --> 00:28:36.252
Why do you keep staring
at me, Mr. Norman?


269
00:28:40.377 --> 00:28:41.845
I wasn't staring at
you, Mr. Lawson.


270
00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.139
Oh, yes, you were, Mr. Norman.
You were looking right at me.


271
00:28:44.214 --> 00:28:46.808
I was not staring at you!

272
00:28:46.884 --> 00:28:48.932
Well, maybe you are unaware of it, sir,
but my old man used to be...


273
00:28:49.011 --> 00:28:51.605
All right, look, that's enough!

274
00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.308
You wanna talk about this more,
we'll go down to the principal's office.


275
00:28:54.391 --> 00:28:56.735
- Okay?
- Hey, I'm cool.


276
00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:59.859
Don't let them upset you,
Mr. Norman.


277
00:28:59.938 --> 00:29:01.940
They're idiots.

278
00:29:07.321 --> 00:29:08.789
Thanks, Kate...

279
00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:15.914
Does anybody else have anything
they wanna say about Billy?


280
00:29:16.705 --> 00:29:19.504
If not, we'll go on with history.

281
00:29:20.459 --> 00:29:23.133
Last time, we were talking
about the Middle East.


282
00:29:23.212 --> 00:29:25.510
We were talking about Iraq.

283
00:29:35.224 --> 00:29:37.818
Now, whoever threw this...

284
00:29:39.144 --> 00:29:42.489
I want everybody here to know
I think you're nothing but a coward!


285
00:29:42.564 --> 00:29:43.656
You're a chicken!

286
00:29:43.732 --> 00:29:46.201
Why don't you throw something
at me while I'm looking, huh?


287
00:29:46.276 --> 00:29:50.907
Throw it to my face! Come on,
somebody throw it! Now!


288
00:29:54.409 --> 00:29:57.538
I'll take the class over for a while.
You take a break here.


289
00:29:57.621 --> 00:30:01.125
- It's okay.
- I said take a break, Mr. Norman.


290
00:30:53.427 --> 00:30:56.522
God is there to pay him his clues.

291
00:30:56.596 --> 00:31:00.601
- Wayne, why is he always looking at me?
- Who?


292
00:31:00.684 --> 00:31:02.436
Jesus.

293
00:31:02.519 --> 00:31:06.023
No matter where we sit,
he looks right at me.


294
00:31:06.106 --> 00:31:07.824
This place scares me.

295
00:31:07.899 --> 00:31:12.700
There's nothing to be afraid of, Jimmy.
This is the safest place I know.


296
00:31:18.994 --> 00:31:24.376
Yeah, what a lovely day for the

297
00:31:31.465 --> 00:31:36.972
You know, all this stuff about Billy's death
brought up a lot of feelings about Wayne.


298
00:31:37.971 --> 00:31:41.475
I'm just trying not
to let it get to me.


299
00:31:42.476 --> 00:31:46.606
I think you're doing great.
I'm proud of you.


300
00:31:47.356 --> 00:31:49.108
Thanks.

301
00:31:52.152 --> 00:31:55.201
Now where's Scotty? Wasn't
he supposed to meet us here?


302
00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.749
Hey, balloon for you.

303
00:32:18.637 --> 00:32:20.560
- There you are.
- Dad, look.


304
00:32:20.639 --> 00:32:23.859
- Where did you get those?
- They fell off that pole.


305
00:32:23.934 --> 00:32:26.107
I used to have shoes like
this when I was a kid.


306
00:32:26.186 --> 00:32:27.608
Can I keep them?

307
00:32:27.687 --> 00:32:30.031
I don't know. They probably
belong to someone.


308
00:32:30.107 --> 00:32:34.328
- What do you think?
- Yeah, they probably belong to somebody.


309
00:32:34.403 --> 00:32:36.701
But I found them.

310
00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:47.967
Dad, look, a video store! Can we
get a movie to watch tonight?


311
00:32:55.465 --> 00:32:59.060
I'm gonna go upstairs.
I'm falling asleep, all right?


312
00:32:59.803 --> 00:33:04.650
- Do you want me to carry him up to bed?
- I want you to carry me up to bed.


313
00:33:05.809 --> 00:33:08.062
Come on, Scotty.

314
00:33:15.944 --> 00:33:17.696
- Are you coming?
- Yeah, I'll be up in just a minute.


315
00:33:17.779 --> 00:33:20.407
I wanna see if he gets the girl.

316
00:33:46.683 --> 00:33:50.654
Run, Jimmy, run! Hurry. Go, go!
Run, run, all right!


317
00:33:50.729 --> 00:33:53.858
Go, go, go! Run! Run!

318
00:34:10.832 --> 00:34:12.584
Wayne...

319
00:34:34.773 --> 00:34:37.572
- Run, Jimmy, run!
- Wayne!


320
00:34:37.651 --> 00:34:39.870
Run, Jimmy, run!

321
00:35:26.074 --> 00:35:28.247
You and me, Jimmy, we're
always gonna stick together.


322
00:35:28.326 --> 00:35:29.452
How much is three...

323
00:35:29.536 --> 00:35:33.757
- We're always gonna stick together.
- Nobody hits me and lives, man!


324
00:35:35.375 --> 00:35:38.254
- Hey, kid!
- Run, Jimmy, run!


325
00:36:11.578 --> 00:36:14.832
Oh, Mr. Norman. What are
you doing down here?


326
00:36:14.914 --> 00:36:18.168
Well, I was just taking a little walk.
Maybe I ought to ask you the same thing.


327
00:36:18.251 --> 00:36:20.595
Oh, well, I was just
taking a walk, too.


328
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:23.549
My mom has a friend over and
we don't really get along.


329
00:36:23.632 --> 00:36:25.680
- I was just on my way back.
- Well, I'll walk with you.


330
00:36:25.759 --> 00:36:28.763
Oh, no. No, that's really fine. I just
live above the cleaners over there.


331
00:36:28.845 --> 00:36:31.769
So... So, see you.

332
00:36:31.848 --> 00:36:35.022
Oh, Kate, you know that old train.

333
00:36:35.101 --> 00:36:38.275
- Does it still run through here?
- Train?


334
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.984
Well, I've never seen a
train and I grew up here.


335
00:36:42.067 --> 00:36:44.570
I guess there used to be one.

336
00:36:46.446 --> 00:36:48.574
Well, be careful.

337
00:36:48.657 --> 00:36:52.002
It's not like I'm lost
in the woods or nothing.


338
00:36:52.077 --> 00:36:55.081
- I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Norman.
- Yeah.


339
00:37:13.515 --> 00:37:16.189
- Run, Jimmy, run!
- Jimmy!


340
00:37:18.061 --> 00:37:19.654
Don't run!

341
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:22.153
Help me, Jimmy!

342
00:37:40.333 --> 00:37:41.926
No!

343
00:37:44.963 --> 00:37:48.763
- Are you all right?
- It's just a dream. Just a dream.


344
00:37:48.842 --> 00:37:51.311
Oh, God, it's just a dream.

345
00:38:00.186 --> 00:38:04.737
Promise me you'll come back to bed.
You haven't slept hardly at all lately.


346
00:38:04.816 --> 00:38:08.195
When I sleep, I dream!
I don't wanna dream!


347
00:38:09.028 --> 00:38:10.905
I'm sorry.

348
00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:16.165
It's starting again, isn't it?

349
00:38:16.244 --> 00:38:18.588
Dad, are you okay?

350
00:38:19.414 --> 00:38:21.382
Your father just had a nightmare.

351
00:38:24.085 --> 00:38:26.554
Come on, let's go back to bed.

352
00:38:48.485 --> 00:38:49.611
Stop it.

353
00:38:51.613 --> 00:38:53.206
Stop it.

354
00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:08.840
Come on, Scotty. They can't all be jerks.
You must like at least one of them.


355
00:39:08.922 --> 00:39:12.017
No, they're all mean.
I don't like them.


356
00:39:12.091 --> 00:39:14.810
- Me and all the other kids...
- Hey, that's enough sugar.


357
00:39:14.886 --> 00:39:16.888
- Daddy does it!
- Hey, hey, come on.


358
00:39:16.971 --> 00:39:19.099
Don't tell on your old man.

359
00:39:19.599 --> 00:39:23.649
- Where'd you go last night?
- Nowhere. Just walking around.


360
00:39:23.728 --> 00:39:27.232
- So you never went back to sleep?
- No.


361
00:39:37.617 --> 00:39:40.837
Maybe we should consider
not staying here.


362
00:39:40.912 --> 00:39:45.588
- What are you talking about?
- Jim, I'm not blind. I can't help it.


363
00:39:45.667 --> 00:39:48.341
I'm concerned about you.
I don't want...


364
00:39:50.672 --> 00:39:55.553
Things to start happening again. Maybe
we should just pack up and leave.


365
00:39:55.635 --> 00:39:57.262
We're going back home?

366
00:39:57.345 --> 00:40:00.895
We're not going anywhere.
Now eat your breakfast.


367
00:40:02.976 --> 00:40:05.900
- Do I have anything to say about anything?
- Oh, yeah.


368
00:40:05.979 --> 00:40:08.198
I just want us to be happy.

369
00:40:08.273 --> 00:40:11.994
Coming here was gonna be a new
beginning, not another...


370
00:40:13.069 --> 00:40:15.117
Not another what?

371
00:40:17.866 --> 00:40:20.995
Great! Great!
I got to get to school.


372
00:40:55.278 --> 00:40:57.497
Help me, please, somebody!

373
00:41:03.286 --> 00:41:05.914
Help me, please, somebody!

374
00:41:11.628 --> 00:41:14.757
Remain in your seats after
you finish your tests.


375
00:41:25.558 --> 00:41:27.902
Okay, I'm giving this
Norman guy another 15...


376
00:41:27.977 --> 00:41:31.823
but I think he's got us
on a wild goose chase.


377
00:41:31.898 --> 00:41:33.650
Anything?

378
00:41:34.734 --> 00:41:36.907
Okay, I'm calling it.

379
00:41:37.904 --> 00:41:42.501
Okay, boys, let's bring it back in.
Everybody check in now. Come on!


380
00:41:43.242 --> 00:41:45.665
Come on, Mr. Norman,
we're gonna break for dinner.


381
00:41:45.745 --> 00:41:49.249
- We'll get back at it later.
- Wait a minute.


382
00:41:49.332 --> 00:41:53.553
- Is there a barn around here someplace?
- Well, yeah.


383
00:41:53.628 --> 00:41:57.098
The old Phelps place is over
there across that creek.


384
00:43:03.823 --> 00:43:06.497
These incidents tend to cluster.

385
00:43:06.576 --> 00:43:11.047
One suicide triggers destructive
behavior in other troubled young people.


386
00:43:11.122 --> 00:43:14.968
I can tell you, it will be the
simple things you do that count.


387
00:43:15.043 --> 00:43:17.091
Trust your instincts.

388
00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:21.641
If someone seems like they're
in trouble, they probably are.


389
00:43:21.716 --> 00:43:24.469
Reach out. Connect with them.

390
00:43:25.762 --> 00:43:29.266
Refer all problems to Dr. Bernardi.

391
00:43:29.348 --> 00:43:32.693
Otherwise, keep everything
smooth and normal.


392
00:43:32.769 --> 00:43:35.443
Come on, we have two
dead children here.


393
00:43:35.521 --> 00:43:37.523
Things aren't smooth
or normal, are they?


394
00:43:37.607 --> 00:43:41.237
And Kate's death wasn't suicide.
She was murdered.


395
00:43:41.319 --> 00:43:42.866
Oh, God...

396
00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.172
Mr. Norman? Mr. Norman?

397
00:44:02.757 --> 00:44:05.727
What makes you think Kate's
death wasn't a suicide?


398
00:44:05.802 --> 00:44:07.145
I just know.

399
00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:10.190
I know both these kids were in
our class. Were you close?


400
00:44:10.264 --> 00:44:14.019
Yes, I liked them both, and
neither one of them was suicidal.


401
00:44:14.102 --> 00:44:17.026
It's a matter of record you've had
some emotional problems in the past.


402
00:44:17.105 --> 00:44:20.405
I was just wondering,
how you're handling this.


403
00:44:21.192 --> 00:44:23.411
What are you getting at?

404
00:44:23.486 --> 00:44:26.615
I counsel faculty as
well as students.


405
00:44:26.697 --> 00:44:29.792
If you'd like to meet in
a confidential setting...


406
00:44:30.535 --> 00:44:32.913
What if it's bizarre?

407
00:44:32.995 --> 00:44:34.713
Bizarre in what way?

408
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:40.003
I have a class to get to.
Excuse me.


409
00:44:50.596 --> 00:44:53.190
Who are you? You don't
belong in this class.


410
00:44:53.266 --> 00:44:55.109
I do now.

411
00:44:56.352 --> 00:44:58.980
I'm a transfer from Milford.

412
00:45:02.483 --> 00:45:07.080
You don't mind if I sit in
this empty desk, do you?


413
00:45:07.155 --> 00:45:09.749
Hey, wait a minute.
That's Kate's old seat.


414
00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.828
He doesn't know that.

415
00:45:14.453 --> 00:45:16.626
Or maybe he does.

416
00:45:17.373 --> 00:45:21.844
You got a problem with that, Jimmy?
I mean, Mr. Norman.


417
00:45:25.715 --> 00:45:29.640
- Do you wanna give that to me?
- I'd love to give it to you.


418
00:46:54.637 --> 00:46:57.356
- Jim?
- Yeah, almost through.


419
00:46:57.431 --> 00:47:01.777
There's a boy at the door.
He says he's one of your students.


420
00:47:07.358 --> 00:47:09.656
Did you keep the door locked?

421
00:47:09.735 --> 00:47:13.740
- Yes.
- Okay. I'll handle this.


422
00:47:18.786 --> 00:47:19.708
Who's here?

423
00:47:19.787 --> 00:47:22.540
You get back to your room.
Go on, now!


424
00:47:40.766 --> 00:47:42.643
What's going on, Chip?
What are you doing here?


425
00:47:42.727 --> 00:47:45.480
Listen, I'm not here to
give you a bad time, okay?


426
00:47:45.563 --> 00:47:48.407
There's something
I have to tell you.


427
00:47:49.483 --> 00:47:51.076
Okay-

428
00:48:00.328 --> 00:48:03.457
- What is it?
- If they do anything...


429
00:48:04.707 --> 00:48:07.586
you got to know that
I wasn't in on it.


430
00:48:08.169 --> 00:48:12.675
I mean, those guys... Mr. Norman,
those guys are seriously crazy.


431
00:48:12.757 --> 00:48:14.759
Lawson and Vincent?

432
00:48:16.677 --> 00:48:20.272
I went out with them
tonight, had a few beers.


433
00:48:20.348 --> 00:48:22.476
You know, and I started talking
about how you were ﬂunking me...


434
00:48:22.558 --> 00:48:24.560
and how I was gonna get
you and everything?


435
00:48:24.643 --> 00:48:26.611
What happened?

436
00:48:28.189 --> 00:48:30.408
They took me right up on it.

437
00:48:30.483 --> 00:48:34.704
They said they knew you a long time
ago and they were gonna get even.


438
00:48:37.698 --> 00:48:39.826
They hate you, Mr. Norman.

439
00:48:39.909 --> 00:48:44.710
Chip, do you think they
killed Billy and Kate?


440
00:48:50.586 --> 00:48:52.259
DO you?

441
00:48:54.048 --> 00:48:56.176
Then you have to say so.
You have to tell the police.


442
00:48:56.258 --> 00:48:58.010
No, if they find out I've been
talking to you, they'll...


443
00:48:58.094 --> 00:49:00.062
- They won't know anything.
- Don't you see?


444
00:49:00.137 --> 00:49:03.097
I'm not going back to school tomorrow.
I've got a brother in Kansas City...


445
00:49:03.099 --> 00:49:07.104
- We got to go stop these guys!
- I've got to go, it's not my fight!


446
00:49:09.146 --> 00:49:11.365
I'm just a jock.

447
00:49:13.401 --> 00:49:15.199
- I'm sorry.
- Chip!


448
00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.947
Wait!

449
00:49:19.865 --> 00:49:22.789
We can't keep running from them!

450
00:49:41.178 --> 00:49:42.725
Chip!

451
00:49:44.807 --> 00:49:46.354
Chip!

452
00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:54.325
- Jim, what's going on?
- Get back in the house!


453
00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:08.418
- Lock all the doors and get upstairs.
- What the hell is going on?


454
00:50:08.497 --> 00:50:11.626
- I don't want you two to get hurt!
- You're scaring Scotty!


455
00:50:14.753 --> 00:50:17.506
- Oh, for God's sake!
- No!


456
00:50:19.258 --> 00:50:21.977
Hello, Mrs. Norman.
I'm Chief Pappas.


457
00:50:22.052 --> 00:50:24.180
I was wondering if I could have
a few words with your husband.


458
00:50:24.263 --> 00:50:26.732
Thank God! They grabbed one of
my students. You got to stop them.


459
00:50:26.807 --> 00:50:30.778
You wouldn't mind coming down to
the station with me, would you?


460
00:51:01.926 --> 00:51:02.927
Hey, pal!

461
00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:05.308
- Okay, please.
- Come on!


462
00:51:05.387 --> 00:51:09.233
- Hit the road, Chip.
- You're making your Sunday drive, Chip.


463
00:51:18.234 --> 00:51:20.657
You haven't met North yet, Chip.

464
00:51:20.736 --> 00:51:24.366
He just came up from down South.

465
00:51:24.448 --> 00:51:28.169
After you're gone, he's gonna
take your seat in class.


466
00:51:33.624 --> 00:51:36.753
Did you have a nice talk
with Jimmy, Chip?


467
00:51:37.294 --> 00:51:41.049
What did you talk about?
Did you talk about us?


468
00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:44.469
You're gonna have a fun ride, Chip.

469
00:51:46.595 --> 00:51:48.188
Now would you listen to me?

470
00:51:48.264 --> 00:51:52.269
There's this kid, Chip Conway, and if
we don't help him he is going to die.


471
00:51:52.351 --> 00:51:54.194
Those punks have him in their car.

472
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:57.270
And they're gonna kill him like they
killed Billy and like they killed Kate.


473
00:51:57.314 --> 00:52:00.659
I know. Okay, sir, I know.
You said that.


474
00:52:01.402 --> 00:52:05.703
You see, well, you seem
to know an awful lot.


475
00:52:05.781 --> 00:52:08.330
A lot of stuff that nobody could
possibly know anything about.


476
00:52:08.409 --> 00:52:11.879
Like finding the girl in the barn.

477
00:52:11.954 --> 00:52:15.800
Like just happening to be on hand
when Billy Stearns was killed.


478
00:52:15.874 --> 00:52:18.718
So you tell me, what
I'm supposed to think?


479
00:52:18.794 --> 00:52:21.013
Look, I don't know what
you're supposed to think.


480
00:52:21.088 --> 00:52:23.307
All I know is my
family is in danger.


481
00:52:23.382 --> 00:52:26.352
- From who? Your students?
- Yes!


482
00:52:26.927 --> 00:52:29.726
God damn it, you charge me
with murder or you let me go!


483
00:52:29.805 --> 00:52:31.682
You sit down!

484
00:52:35.936 --> 00:52:38.655
Does my driving scare you, Chip?

485
00:52:38.731 --> 00:52:42.577
Oh, he's a tough man.
He ain't scared of anything!


486
00:52:50.326 --> 00:52:51.873
Still not scared, huh?

487
00:52:51.952 --> 00:52:54.421
No, no, you're cool as a
corpse, right, Chippie?


488
00:53:01.879 --> 00:53:05.133
Well, boys, what's it gonna
take to scare this guy?


489
00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:09.265
- The face.
- Oh, man, the face?


490
00:53:09.887 --> 00:53:11.514
You do it, North.

491
00:53:12.348 --> 00:53:14.396
That's for kids, man.

492
00:53:15.017 --> 00:53:16.690
I'll do it.

493
00:53:16.769 --> 00:53:19.943
Man, we must be bored
doing this crap.


494
00:53:32.159 --> 00:53:37.211
It ain't working, Vinnie. He ain't scared.
Are you, Chippie, you Knucklehead?


495
00:53:44.838 --> 00:53:46.556
Time to rock, jock.

496
00:54:22.918 --> 00:54:24.670
It's Dad!

497
00:54:29.299 --> 00:54:31.472
Dad, how was jail?

498
00:54:32.553 --> 00:54:36.228
Hey, I wasn't in jail, okay? He just
wanted to ask me some questions.


499
00:54:36.306 --> 00:54:40.152
Scottie, go in and finish your
breakfast. You've got school.


500
00:54:40.811 --> 00:54:42.404
Okay...

501
00:54:47.901 --> 00:54:49.653
They think you killed
Billy and Kate.


502
00:54:49.737 --> 00:54:53.332
- Yeah, but they have no evidence.
- What are you gonna do?


503
00:54:53.407 --> 00:54:55.956
I'm going in to teach. Now,
come on, I want a cup of coffee.


504
00:54:56.034 --> 00:55:00.915
Talk to me, Jim. Why would
they think such a thing?


505
00:55:00.998 --> 00:55:04.673
- Because they're being made to think it.
- By whom?


506
00:55:04.752 --> 00:55:07.255
Please don't shut me out.

507
00:55:07.337 --> 00:55:10.261
We got through your last
breakdown by talking things out.


508
00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:13.560
I don't wanna talk it out,
okay? I'm tired.


509
00:55:13.635 --> 00:55:17.560
I know. You haven't slept for more than
three hours in the last four days.


510
00:55:17.639 --> 00:55:21.109
Look what you're doing to yourself.
I feel as if I'm losing you.


511
00:55:21.185 --> 00:55:24.815
You're not losing me. I just...
I need a little more time, that's all.


512
00:55:24.897 --> 00:55:28.697
I just need some time
to figure this thing out.


513
00:55:47.419 --> 00:55:52.266
It seems another one of your
students did disappear last night.


514
00:55:53.634 --> 00:55:55.352
Chip?

515
00:55:55.427 --> 00:55:59.273
- I told you.
- Yeah. Amazing.


516
00:56:01.058 --> 00:56:04.153
We'll let you know when
we find something.


517
00:56:04.228 --> 00:56:08.699
Or you let us know when
you remember something.


518
00:56:50.858 --> 00:56:55.113
Say, Jimmy, you remember
North here, don't you?


519
00:56:55.195 --> 00:56:57.618
He decided to come up and
visit when Chip cashed in.


520
00:56:57.698 --> 00:57:00.167
Transferred up from Milford.

521
00:57:00.242 --> 00:57:02.665
Now we can finish
unfinished business, Jimmy.


522
00:57:02.744 --> 00:57:06.339
You always wanted to be like
your brother, didn't you, Jimmy?


523
00:57:06.415 --> 00:57:08.884
- Yeah, dead.
- Very dead.


524
00:57:09.835 --> 00:57:12.714
- You can't run away this time.
- Tonight's the big night, Jimmy.


525
00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:14.798
Don't tell us you don't remember
today's the anniversary?


526
00:57:14.882 --> 00:57:17.931
He probably forgets his wife's.

527
00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:23.062
And speaking of family, how's
that kid of yours, Jimmy?


528
00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:24.983
Bet he's a chicken.

529
00:57:27.352 --> 00:57:30.652
- Just like his old man.
- We'll find out.


530
00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:34.113
See you tonight, Jimmy boy.

531
00:57:34.735 --> 00:57:37.409
Be there or be square, man.

532
00:57:42.993 --> 00:57:45.121
Leave my family out of this!

533
00:57:45.203 --> 00:57:48.503
- Hey, man, what are you doing?
- Come on, don't hurt us.


534
00:57:48.582 --> 00:57:50.676
Hey, be cool, man.

535
00:58:04.514 --> 00:58:08.360
And after that level, you turn
into a rocket. It's really cool.


536
00:58:08.435 --> 00:58:11.234
Well, anyways, see you guys later.

537
00:58:50.644 --> 00:58:54.774
Mommy, help me! Please, help me!
Somebody help!


538
00:58:54.856 --> 00:58:57.985
Help! Please! Help me!

539
00:59:11.790 --> 00:59:13.383
What happened?

540
00:59:13.458 --> 00:59:15.552
Thank God, he's okay.

541
00:59:15.627 --> 00:59:18.881
Some guys in a black
car tried to hit him.


542
00:59:18.964 --> 00:59:20.762
The cops are out looking for them.

543
00:59:20.841 --> 00:59:24.471
- Did anybody else see the car?
- No, just Scotty.


544
00:59:26.388 --> 00:59:30.894
Well, we'll get you inside.
Let's get you cleaned up.


545
00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:41.787
Now you don't have to sleep.
I just want you to rest. Okay?


546
00:59:45.657 --> 00:59:47.455
Dad?

547
00:59:48.577 --> 00:59:50.796
Can we leave here?

548
00:59:55.333 --> 00:59:59.179
It won't happen again,
Scotty. I promise you.


549
00:59:59.254 --> 01:00:02.633
We're all gonna be fine. Okay?

550
01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:09.227
You know, I have been saving something
for you and I wanted you to have it.


551
01:00:09.306 --> 01:00:12.185
I've just been waiting
for the perfect time.


552
01:00:12.267 --> 01:00:15.737
This was given to me
when I was your age.


553
01:00:16.855 --> 01:00:20.576
And it means a lot to me.
I want you to have it.


554
01:00:23.111 --> 01:00:25.034
Thanks, Dad.

555
01:00:27.449 --> 01:00:29.326
It's cool.

556
01:00:34.081 --> 01:00:35.754
Looking good.

557
01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:48.807
Sally?

558
01:00:52.682 --> 01:00:54.355
Honey?

559
01:00:59.231 --> 01:01:00.904
Sally?

560
01:01:03.235 --> 01:01:04.782
Sally?

561
01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:08.915
- Didn't you hear me?
- The dryer was on.


562
01:01:14.704 --> 01:01:16.251
You got to listen to me.

563
01:01:16.331 --> 01:01:19.505
There are some punks in my
class and they're after me.


564
01:01:19.584 --> 01:01:22.053
They are the ones that
tried to scare Scotty.


565
01:01:22.129 --> 01:01:24.973
That's what this is about.
They're killers.


566
01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:29.519
They killed Billy, they killed
Kate and now they want me.


567
01:01:30.846 --> 01:01:34.567
Why would kids in your
class wanna kill you?


568
01:01:36.434 --> 01:01:39.734
They're the same guys
that killed my brother.


569
01:01:42.107 --> 01:01:45.031
Jim, how do you expect
me to respond to that?


570
01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:47.704
The boys who killed
your brother are dead.


571
01:01:47.779 --> 01:01:52.660
They were killed by a train. You know
that. How could they be alive?


572
01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:54.119
They're not.

573
01:01:54.202 --> 01:01:59.299
Twenty-seven years ago, today, they killed
Wayne and now they came back for me.


574
01:01:59.374 --> 01:02:03.095
They told me, they're gonna play
this whole thing out again.


575
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:05.593
Look, I am not crazy.

576
01:02:05.672 --> 01:02:07.891
You got to believe me.

577
01:02:08.675 --> 01:02:13.306
I want you to lock all the doors and
windows and don't let anybody in.


578
01:02:29.279 --> 01:02:30.656
Jimmy?

579
01:02:30.739 --> 01:02:32.537
What's wrong?

580
01:02:41.708 --> 01:02:45.554
Excuse me. I need to find a policeman
from about 20, 25 years ago.


581
01:02:45.629 --> 01:02:48.758
- His name was Nell. Officer Nell.
- That'd be Bob Nell.


582
01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.093
Right. I got to see him.
It's very, very important.


583
01:02:51.176 --> 01:02:53.645
No, he hasn't been on
the force in years.


584
01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.973
He got shot during a burglary
call some years ago.


585
01:02:56.056 --> 01:02:57.683
Almost died, poor bastard.

586
01:02:57.766 --> 01:02:59.985
He's over in Smithfield now,
the retirement home.


587
01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:03.064
I got to warn you, he's
gone around the bend a bit.


588
01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:07.026
Ever since his accident,
he thinks he sees dead people.


589
01:03:12.656 --> 01:03:13.999
Jimmy?

590
01:03:14.699 --> 01:03:18.670
- Jimmy Norman!
- My God, you remember me.


591
01:03:18.745 --> 01:03:23.876
You look into a person's eyes,
you always know who he is or was.


592
01:03:24.751 --> 01:03:27.095
I've been waiting for you, son.

593
01:03:32.092 --> 01:03:36.563
Hey, slow it down.
This is a residential area.


594
01:03:38.556 --> 01:03:40.979
Jimmy and Wayne Norman.

595
01:03:41.059 --> 01:03:44.609
- You two were something else.
- Yes, sir, we were.


596
01:03:46.815 --> 01:03:49.694
I know this is gonna
sound crazy, but...


597
01:03:50.485 --> 01:03:54.661
those boys, the ones
who killed Wayne...


598
01:03:57.284 --> 01:03:59.912
I think they're back again.

599
01:03:59.995 --> 01:04:02.043
I know. I saw him.

600
01:04:02.122 --> 01:04:05.877
- You saw who?
- Your brother Wayne.


601
01:04:06.751 --> 01:04:09.470
He needs you to settle it.

602
01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:10.593
Wayne?

603
01:04:13.008 --> 01:04:16.103
There was this routine burglary.

604
01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.690
Routine except that
I got shot in the head.


605
01:04:19.764 --> 01:04:23.689
The doctors said I was clinically
dead for over three minutes.


606
01:04:23.768 --> 01:04:28.114
And that's when I saw him,
Wayne, from the other side.


607
01:04:28.189 --> 01:04:32.160
He was waiting,
stuck in that midrealm.


608
01:04:33.028 --> 01:04:37.499
That dimension between here
and one's final destination.


609
01:04:38.742 --> 01:04:42.121
Sometimes, son,
they're in our hearts.


610
01:04:42.203 --> 01:04:45.332
Sometimes they're in our thoughts.

611
01:04:45.415 --> 01:04:50.012
But if they're unhappy enough,
if something's left unsettled...


612
01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.888
sometimes they come back.

613
01:04:55.884 --> 01:04:57.557
They...

614
01:04:57.635 --> 01:05:03.859
Those punks told me they had
transferred in from Milford.


615
01:05:04.809 --> 01:05:07.858
I checked. I can't
find any Milford High.


616
01:05:10.023 --> 01:05:12.902
That's because it isn't a school.

617
01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:43.681
Lawson.

618
01:05:50.605 --> 01:05:52.278
North.

619
01:05:54.776 --> 01:05:56.494
Vincent.

620
01:05:58.238 --> 01:06:02.869
- Hey, Mueller! Mueller!
- You coward.


621
01:06:03.493 --> 01:06:05.587
Mueller...

622
01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:08.752
Yes...

623
01:06:14.087 --> 01:06:18.137
- Welcome to Milford, Jimmy.
- Looking for Mueller, kid?


624
01:06:18.216 --> 01:06:22.062
You're gonna need him
to put this all together.


625
01:06:22.137 --> 01:06:26.483
- Unless we find him first.
- So you better get going, Daddy-O.


626
01:06:26.558 --> 01:06:29.152
You don't have much time.

627
01:06:30.603 --> 01:06:34.608
You're going down tonight, Jimmy!
Tonight, Jimmy!


628
01:07:14.105 --> 01:07:16.483
I'm looking for Karl Mueller.

629
01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:18.239
Who are you?

630
01:07:19.277 --> 01:07:23.157
Jimmy Norman. Wayne
Norman's little brother.


631
01:07:27.702 --> 01:07:29.830
What do you want?

632
01:07:31.581 --> 01:07:33.800
Boy, look at you.

633
01:07:33.875 --> 01:07:36.219
You're the man who punched
my big brother...


634
01:07:36.294 --> 01:07:40.094
knocked him down on the ground and
kicked him when he was defenseless, huh?


635
01:07:40.173 --> 01:07:43.393
Is this what happens to
tough guys like you, huh?


636
01:07:47.388 --> 01:07:50.107
That thing with your
brother was an accident!


637
01:07:50.183 --> 01:07:54.108
Hell, I almost got killed myself.
I just got out right before the train hit.


638
01:07:54.187 --> 01:07:58.533
- Come on, you're coming with me.
- Hey, where are you taking me, man?


639
01:08:00.401 --> 01:08:01.994
Let's go!

640
01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:05.114
Come on, get out!

641
01:08:06.407 --> 01:08:10.503
- What is this? What are we doing here?
- Reliving your past.


642
01:08:10.578 --> 01:08:11.579
Come on!

643
01:08:11.663 --> 01:08:13.791
Mueller, don't you know?
Your buddies are back.


644
01:08:13.873 --> 01:08:16.342
Lawson, Vinnie, North!

645
01:08:16.417 --> 01:08:19.341
For every life they took,
one of them came back.


646
01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:22.469
Seems they're here to finish up some old
business and we're part of the plan.


647
01:08:22.549 --> 01:08:25.098
- You're crazy!
- Yeah?


648
01:08:25.176 --> 01:08:28.976
All right, I'm here with Mueller!

649
01:08:29.055 --> 01:08:31.399
I'm waiting for you!

650
01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:34.603
This is freaking crazy. You're nuts!
I'm getting out of here.


651
01:08:34.686 --> 01:08:39.066
Mueller, come back here!
You coward!


652
01:12:00.558 --> 01:12:04.062
Hello, Mrs. Norman. Can
Jimmy come out and play?


653
01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:30.296
Welcome to the
neighborhood, Mrs. Norman.


654
01:12:35.718 --> 01:12:37.846
Hello, baby!

655
01:13:05.414 --> 01:13:07.792
Nice shooting, Jimbo.

656
01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:12.430
But you can't kill
what's already dead.


657
01:13:15.424 --> 01:13:18.598
All right, come on. Come on,
I'm not running this time.


658
01:13:18.678 --> 01:13:20.055
Good, then we'll see you there.

659
01:13:20.137 --> 01:13:22.231
We wanted to make sure
you were coming, Jimmy.


660
01:13:22.306 --> 01:13:26.186
Bring the wife and kid.
It's fun for the whole family.


661
01:13:32.108 --> 01:13:33.405
Come on, let's go.

662
01:13:33.484 --> 01:13:36.363
- Where are we gonna go?
- Someplace safe.


663
01:13:42.493 --> 01:13:44.336
Come on, come on!

664
01:13:45.288 --> 01:13:47.382
Get inside, come on!

665
01:13:59.427 --> 01:14:03.057
Come on now. You and Scotty
will be safe in here.


666
01:14:03.139 --> 01:14:05.312
My brother promised me.

667
01:14:07.059 --> 01:14:08.777
They were the ones who
killed him, weren't they?


668
01:14:08.853 --> 01:14:13.279
Yeah. And my students.

669
01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:16.369
Why are they after you?

670
01:14:26.203 --> 01:14:27.705
Hey, kid!

671
01:14:28.706 --> 01:14:32.336
- They want revenge.
- For what?


672
01:14:33.127 --> 01:14:36.131
- Something that happened on that day.
- Oh, let's just go.


673
01:14:36.213 --> 01:14:38.341
We could just get in the
car and never come back.


674
01:14:38.424 --> 01:14:41.644
No, they'll find me. They'll
follow me no matter where I go.


675
01:14:41.719 --> 01:14:43.721
I can't keep running.

676
01:14:44.597 --> 01:14:49.774
I have to change what happened,
and then after tonight it'll all be over.


677
01:14:51.187 --> 01:14:52.780
Jim?

678
01:14:54.273 --> 01:14:56.947
I'm so sorry that I doubted you.

679
01:14:57.610 --> 01:14:59.408
I love you.

680
01:15:07.495 --> 01:15:09.497
I will come back.

681
01:17:10.493 --> 01:17:13.417
So you were the one who took them.

682
01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:23.889
What are you doing here, Mueller?

683
01:17:26.342 --> 01:17:29.061
I've been coming by
this place for years.


684
01:17:29.136 --> 01:17:33.812
I used to park my car across the street
at night and just look at the place.


685
01:17:35.518 --> 01:17:38.863
I watched it fall apart,
just like me.


686
01:17:38.938 --> 01:17:41.532
I never meant anything to
happen to your brother.


687
01:17:41.607 --> 01:17:46.454
You got to believe me. My life's
been hell since that clay.


688
01:17:48.864 --> 01:17:52.164
I know it's crazy,
but I believe what you say.


689
01:17:53.661 --> 01:17:55.914
I believe they're back.

690
01:17:56.580 --> 01:18:00.676
I guess somehow I always
knew they would be.


691
01:18:06.006 --> 01:18:10.352
- So what do you wanna do?
- I'm tired of being afraid.


692
01:18:12.972 --> 01:18:15.725
I'm not gonna be afraid anymore.

693
01:18:18.894 --> 01:18:20.896
Let's do it.

694
01:18:57.308 --> 01:19:00.027
You know, I bet Vinnie
here a whole nickel...


695
01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:03.322
that your old clunker
wouldn't burn rubber, Jimmy.


696
01:19:03.397 --> 01:19:05.491
But I was wrong.

697
01:19:05.566 --> 01:19:07.739
Everything burns.

698
01:19:07.818 --> 01:19:11.448
What do you know?
It's Mueller time.


699
01:19:11.530 --> 01:19:13.157
Is that you, Mueller?

700
01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.834
What are you doing, man?
You belong with us, remember?


701
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:19.540
Look at you. You used
to be cool, man.


702
01:19:19.622 --> 01:19:21.875
- Until your little belly turned yellow.
- My God!


703
01:19:21.957 --> 01:19:23.504
- You got old.
- And ugly.


704
01:19:23.584 --> 01:19:25.552
You stink, but we
missed you, Mueller.


705
01:19:25.628 --> 01:19:29.553
You're gonna stand with us,
just like old times, man.


706
01:19:32.509 --> 01:19:36.855
The gang's all here.
Everybody except for Wayne.


707
01:19:38.265 --> 01:19:40.563
He's a definite no-show.

708
01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:54.365
No! No!

709
01:20:01.872 --> 01:20:04.250
- So, where we going?
- You don't know?


710
01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:06.006
He sure as hell does.

711
01:20:06.085 --> 01:20:08.838
We're going to the tunnel
for old times' sake, Mueller.


712
01:20:08.921 --> 01:20:12.266
But first, I thought we'd stop off at
the old church to see some friends.


713
01:20:21.934 --> 01:20:23.436
Mom?

714
01:20:24.645 --> 01:20:29.242
- I'm hungry.
- Soon, when your father gets back.


715
01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.283
It's Dad!

716
01:20:33.362 --> 01:20:34.488
Scotty!

717
01:20:35.406 --> 01:20:38.956
- Scotty, no.
- Did you light a candle for me?


718
01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:41.628
- What are you waiting for?
- Go ahead.


719
01:20:41.704 --> 01:20:44.002
Yeah, you first, Einstein.

720
01:20:53.882 --> 01:20:59.264
Light a candle for me, Sally!
Come on out here, pretty baby!


721
01:21:22.619 --> 01:21:26.214
Oh, please, Wayne. 
Please, help me.

722
01:21:27.374 --> 01:21:31.595
I need you. I can't
do this by myself.


723
01:21:33.714 --> 01:21:36.763
No matter what the pain
or the cost, I'll pay it.


724
01:21:36.842 --> 01:21:39.436
Please, please, help me!

725
01:22:28.602 --> 01:22:31.822
Wayne! Please!

726
01:22:34.858 --> 01:22:37.156
Please, help me!

727
01:22:37.778 --> 01:22:40.156
Did you feel that?

728
01:22:40.239 --> 01:22:41.912
Yup.

729
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:45.085
I thought I felt someone
trying to come through.


730
01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:49.506
Hey, Mueller,
maybe it was your mama.


731
01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:53.176
Maybe it was your mama, North!

732
01:22:54.586 --> 01:22:55.508
Sally?

733
01:22:57.005 --> 01:23:01.602
We're gonna come back when we're
welcome, baby, around midnight.


734
01:23:03.303 --> 01:23:05.055
Come on, Mueller.

735
01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:25.834
- Scott?
- Dad's here!


736
01:23:28.454 --> 01:23:30.172
Scott!

737
01:23:31.999 --> 01:23:34.502
You love your daddy, Scott?

738
01:23:36.336 --> 01:23:39.316
It's a nice kid you
got here, Mrs. Norman.


739
01:23:39.342 --> 01:23:42.459
If you hurt him,
I swear to God, I'll...


740
01:23:42.509 --> 01:23:45.513
Hey, come on, don't hurt the kid!

741
01:23:45.596 --> 01:23:47.940
Shut up, Mueller.

742
01:24:00.277 --> 01:24:04.953
Don't you know, Sally, that
nobody hits me and lives?


743
01:24:05.574 --> 01:24:07.952
You're lucky I have a
date tonight to keep.


744
01:24:08.035 --> 01:24:11.960
Otherwise you and I might have
a little fun of our own! Huh?


745
01:24:13.707 --> 01:24:16.301
It's time to wail, boys.

746
01:24:25.969 --> 01:24:29.519
"How much is three
times two, times two?"


747
01:24:30.224 --> 01:24:33.774
"Oh, that's easy, 12."

748
01:24:35.562 --> 01:24:41.160
"Like I always said, Jimmy, you got
all the brains in the family."


749
01:24:44.863 --> 01:24:47.958
"You're not gonna go through
the tunnel, are you?"


750
01:24:48.033 --> 01:24:50.912
"Sure. It's faster."

751
01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:15.902
Hey, buttface,
you're blocking the road.


752
01:25:15.978 --> 01:25:18.572
Oh, sissy with books.

753
01:25:18.647 --> 01:25:20.820
Read me a story, sissy?

754
01:25:20.899 --> 01:25:22.401
Dad! Dad, help!

755
01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:24.486
- Scotty?
- Dad, help!


756
01:25:24.570 --> 01:25:26.664
Call it insurance, Jimmy.

757
01:25:26.738 --> 01:25:30.663
We wanted to make sure you weren't
gonna chicken out on us this time.


758
01:25:39.126 --> 01:25:40.503
Jim!

759
01:25:40.586 --> 01:25:42.179
Dad!

760
01:25:42.254 --> 01:25:43.676
Jim!

761
01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:59.856
Well, well, well, it's
good to see you, Jimmy.


762
01:25:59.938 --> 01:26:02.282
You know the routine.

763
01:26:02.357 --> 01:26:04.359
- How much money have you got?
- Twelve cents.


764
01:26:04.443 --> 01:26:07.447
Liar. You gonna run and tell on us?

765
01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:13.953
- I'm not running anywhere.
- Good.


766
01:26:14.036 --> 01:26:18.416
'Cause we're gonna finish it this time.
And you're gonna come with us.


767
01:26:20.876 --> 01:26:24.346
Wayne, I know you're
with me. I can feel you.


768
01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.683
What's going on?

769
01:26:31.762 --> 01:26:36.438
This. You wanna get through this
tunnel, you gotta pay, get it?


770
01:26:37.309 --> 01:26:39.607
- So how much money have you got?
- Jim!


771
01:26:39.686 --> 01:26:42.280
I told you, 12 cents.

772
01:26:43.398 --> 01:26:46.652
- Mueller, what the hell are you doing?
- Leave him alone.


773
01:26:46.735 --> 01:26:50.239
Vinnie, get this bum out
before I smack him!


774
01:26:57.746 --> 01:27:00.795
What are you doing? You're
not supposed to kill him!


775
01:27:00.874 --> 01:27:04.219
- You're gonna mess the whole thing up!
- Shut up!


776
01:27:04.294 --> 01:27:06.547
He deserved it!

777
01:27:07.589 --> 01:27:12.766
For every life they take,
another can come back, right?


778
01:27:26.566 --> 01:27:28.534
We're gonna have company, boys.

779
01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:54.803
My God!

780
01:27:58.348 --> 01:28:00.350
Wayne?

781
01:28:00.434 --> 01:28:02.186
Now the gang's all here, Vinnie.

782
01:28:02.269 --> 01:28:04.897
- Leave us alone.
- Shut up!


783
01:28:06.148 --> 01:28:07.741
Shut up.

784
01:28:07.816 --> 01:28:10.057
You wanna get through this
tunnel, you gotta pay, get it?


785
01:28:10.110 --> 01:28:13.239
- We're not going back!
- No!


786
01:28:13.321 --> 01:28:15.540
There ain't no other way
back except our way!


787
01:28:15.615 --> 01:28:18.368
I said, leave us alone.

788
01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:36.432
You ain't coming
back this time, kid!


789
01:28:38.263 --> 01:28:40.357
Vinnie, heads up!

790
01:28:45.187 --> 01:28:48.817
Man, nobody hits me.

791
01:28:54.029 --> 01:28:55.781
Oh, my God.

792
01:28:55.864 --> 01:28:57.707
There's no train running
through here anymore.


793
01:28:57.783 --> 01:29:02.004
- Run, Jimmy, run!
- Lawson? Remember this?


794
01:29:04.247 --> 01:29:06.500
This is why you died.

795
01:29:21.932 --> 01:29:22.899
No way.

796
01:29:28.897 --> 01:29:31.696
It's all over, Lawson.
Now you can go to hell!


797
01:29:31.775 --> 01:29:35.951
- Next time, man, there's always next time.
- No, this is it.


798
01:29:36.029 --> 01:29:38.407
Come on. Let's go!

799
01:29:41.326 --> 01:29:42.373
Come on.

800
01:29:47.290 --> 01:29:48.883
Come on. Come on. Run for it.

801
01:29:48.959 --> 01:29:50.552
Go!

802
01:29:50.627 --> 01:29:53.380
- Come on, come on.
- No!


803
01:29:57.467 --> 01:30:01.472
- Come on! Come on!
- Hey, kid!


804
01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.312
Get down!

805
01:30:39.175 --> 01:30:40.768
Dad!

806
01:30:43.138 --> 01:30:46.483
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.


807
01:30:47.684 --> 01:30:49.186
Okay-

808
01:30:51.146 --> 01:30:52.819
Jimmy?

809
01:30:54.566 --> 01:30:59.072
- No, Jim's my dad.
- But that's my cap. I gave it to Jimmy.


810
01:30:59.154 --> 01:31:00.906
I know you did.

811
01:31:01.781 --> 01:31:04.785
And I gave it to my son.

812
01:31:04.868 --> 01:31:08.213
His name is Scott.
He's named after our dad.


813
01:31:09.998 --> 01:31:13.252
I'm your brother, Wayne. I'm Jimmy.

814
01:31:15.003 --> 01:31:19.008
No, that can't be.
Jimmy's my little brother.


815
01:31:23.553 --> 01:31:26.033
- I'm still your little brother.
- My brother's nine years old.


816
01:31:26.056 --> 01:31:27.808
I grew up.

817
01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:31.061
It's been 27 years since...

818
01:31:34.606 --> 01:31:36.825
Since you died.

819
01:31:46.826 --> 01:31:50.922
I don't wanna go back.
Please, I wanna stay.


820
01:31:50.997 --> 01:31:55.548
- I was all alone there.
- I'd do anything to have you back again...


821
01:31:55.627 --> 01:31:58.722
to make up for all
those lost years.


822
01:32:01.007 --> 01:32:03.135
You can't stay.

823
01:32:04.427 --> 01:32:06.771
Then come with me, Jimmy.

824
01:32:12.227 --> 01:32:15.231
Please, Jimmy, 
I need you with me.

825
01:32:15.981 --> 01:32:19.360
We were always gonna stick
together, remember?


826
01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:24.865
Wayne, please try to understand.

827
01:32:25.907 --> 01:32:28.160
I can't go with you.

828
01:32:29.744 --> 01:32:36.252
I have a wife and a son and
I love them very much.


829
01:32:36.334 --> 01:32:38.086
Wayne?

830
01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.469
Jim loves you so much.

831
01:32:42.215 --> 01:32:44.809
But we need him here.

832
01:32:44.884 --> 01:32:47.182
Scotty needs him.

833
01:32:47.679 --> 01:32:50.683
The same way that Jimmy needed you.

834
01:32:51.725 --> 01:32:56.151
I can't go with you, Wayne.
But you won't be alone anymore.


835
01:32:57.063 --> 01:33:01.443
Now that this is over, you're
gonna go to a better place...


836
01:33:01.526 --> 01:33:04.325
where Mom and Dad
are waiting for you.


837
01:33:05.155 --> 01:33:07.123
I love you, Wayne.

838
01:33:08.533 --> 01:33:13.755
And you'll always be in my
heart and in my thoughts.


839
01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:21.013
And one day, we'll be
together again, I promise.


840
01:33:39.856 --> 01:33:41.574
Wayne?

841
01:33:43.443 --> 01:33:47.573
You and me, we'll
always stick together.


842
01:34:23.358 --> 01:34:29.536
Scotty, I want you to hold on
to these and don't lose them.


843
01:34:30.490 --> 01:34:32.618
What are they?

844
01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:34.873
Good luck coins.

845
01:34:34.953 --> 01:34:37.547
My big brother gave them to me.
