00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:30.448
<i>Bella Brown.</i>

2
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.214
<i>Well, what can I say?</i>

3
00:00:32.712 --> 00:00:34.849
<i>There was nothing
normal about the girl.</i>


4
00:00:36.013 --> 00:00:40.185
<i>It's a miracle she survived at all
after her arrival in this world.</i>


5
00:00:41.246 --> 00:00:44.780
<i>They say she would have perished
if it hadn't been for the ducks.</i>


6
00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:47.991
<i>Sat on her like an egg,
they did.</i>


7
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.153
<i>Treated her as one of their own.</i>

8
00:00:59.313 --> 00:01:02.655
<i>She was finally discovered by
one of those ancient lunatics</i>


9
00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.389
<i>who frequent
the parks of our city</i>


10
00:01:05.647 --> 00:01:07.920
<i>and seem to
enjoy hypothermia.</i>


11
00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:13.780
<i>She grew into the
oddest of oddballs.</i>


12
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.719
<i>Terrified by the unpredictability
of nature and flora in particular.</i>


13
00:01:25.113 --> 00:01:28.455
<i>Where on Earth that came from,
I dread to think.</i>


14
00:01:30.346 --> 00:01:32.914
<i>She's always had
a preoccupation with order.</i>


15
00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:36.257
<i>Would have tried the
patience of a saint,</i>


16
00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.786
<i>never mind the nuns
at Saint Fedelma's.</i>


17
00:01:39.246 --> 00:01:40.848
Bella Brown.

18
00:01:41.946 --> 00:01:45.447
<i>It's an insular and solitary world
for Miss Brown.</i>


19
00:01:46.413 --> 00:01:48.584
<i>Just her and her books.</i>

20
00:01:49.912 --> 00:01:53.118
<i>Hers was a story just
waiting to be told.</i>


21
00:01:54.646 --> 00:01:57.386
<i>But the obsessive little
world she created</i>


22
00:01:57.812 --> 00:02:01.881
<i>meant that this was one book
that remained firmly shut.</i>


23
00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:07.881
<i>I'm not a religious man,</i>

24
00:02:08.313 --> 00:02:10.813
<i>but I believe someone sent her here</i>

25
00:02:11.513 --> 00:02:12.888
<i>to test us.</i>

26
00:03:39.146 --> 00:03:42.420
Today, I'm going to
make a difference.


27
00:03:56.712 --> 00:04:00.384
<i>Why am I wasting your time with
all this worthless tittle-tattle?</i>


28
00:04:01.446 --> 00:04:05.651
<i>Because through some misguided care
in the community scheme,</i>


29
00:04:06.013 --> 00:04:10.082
<i>this strange creature
has become my next-door neighbor.</i>


30
00:04:22.812 --> 00:04:24.415
<i>May I remind you,</i>

31
00:04:24.712 --> 00:04:26.213
on your allocated days

32
00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:28.617
you are to arrive
here by 9:00 and


33
00:04:28.619 --> 00:04:31.224
work until 4:30 with
an hour for lunch


34
00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:33.120
and two 15-minute breaks for tea.

35
00:04:35.179 --> 00:04:38.713
This morning you are to attend to
"Oceanography, A through to J,"


36
00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:40.382
which is quite frankly,
all at "C".


37
00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:42.251
Hmm.

38
00:04:47.313 --> 00:04:49.586
Ah, hello. Erm...

39
00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:54.489
Sorry. Er, I'm looking for Leonardo
di ser Piero, er, da Vinci, please,


40
00:04:54.545 --> 00:04:58.183
erm, technical drawings and the
like, if you'd be so kind.


41
00:04:58.545 --> 00:05:01.217
"Leonardo da Vinci,
civil engineering,"


42
00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:05.280
in brackets, "European history."
Our back wall, bottom left.


43
00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:07.687
- Ah, marvelous.
- Oh, and are you a member?


44
00:05:07.746 --> 00:05:09.451
Oh, no, not going to
take them anywhere.


45
00:05:09.512 --> 00:05:11.512
I'd only lose them,
and where would that get us?


46
00:05:11.846 --> 00:05:15.347
Yes, may I remind you, no eating
or drinking in the library


47
00:05:15.413 --> 00:05:19.754
and we expect absolute silence
at all times.


48
00:05:20.313 --> 00:05:21.553
- Of course you can.
- Absolute.


49
00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.584
Absolutely.

50
00:05:23.712 --> 00:05:25.349
Oh. Hello, sorry.

51
00:05:26.545 --> 00:05:28.023
Oh, thank you once again.

52
00:05:28.512 --> 00:05:30.854
Yes, sorry. No, my mistake.
Sorry, yes.


53
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.652
Mmm.

54
00:06:07.213 --> 00:06:09.350
Oh. Yes, yes, sorry. Absolutely.

55
00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:22.488
<i>The library will be closing
in three minutes exactly.</i>


56
00:06:22.545 --> 00:06:24.921
<i>Please return your books
from whence they came,</i>


57
00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:27.718
<i>and make your way
to the exit immediately.</i>


58
00:06:28.545 --> 00:06:29.716
<i>Thank you.</i>

59
00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:47.948
Huh.

60
00:07:34.545 --> 00:07:35.750
No!

61
00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:44.747
Look what I've found.

62
00:08:58.512 --> 00:09:01.718
Ah, yes. Our very own
horticultural terrorist.


63
00:09:02.245 --> 00:09:05.223
That place has gone to rack and
ruin since she's moved in.


64
00:09:05.412 --> 00:09:08.152
Will you please calm down
and leave the poor girl alone?


65
00:09:08.245 --> 00:09:10.245
"Leave her alone"?
Have you seen what's she's done?


66
00:09:10.278 --> 00:09:13.279
It's nothing less
than wanton criminal neglect.


67
00:09:13.512 --> 00:09:17.650
I'm Milly Wilton, Mr. Stevenson's
long-suffering doctor.


68
00:09:18.479 --> 00:09:19.718
You took a tumble.

69
00:09:19.779 --> 00:09:21.654
Your garden fought back,
that's what.


70
00:09:21.712 --> 00:09:24.588
- You'll survive, no harm done.
- "No harm done"?


71
00:09:24.846 --> 00:09:27.949
I think harm's had
an absolute bloody field day.


72
00:09:28.579 --> 00:09:30.181
Blood pressure.

73
00:09:35.445 --> 00:09:37.389
- Ah.
- Don't worry.


74
00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:38.918
Tea is on its way.

75
00:09:40.612 --> 00:09:43.090
Vernon! Where's that damn tea?

76
00:09:44.545 --> 00:09:48.318
So, young lady, what is it you do
when you're not murdering plants?


77
00:09:48.746 --> 00:09:51.553
I work in the library,
filing mostly.


78
00:09:52.746 --> 00:09:55.417
- But really, I'm a writer.
- Ah, a writer, I see.


79
00:09:55.545 --> 00:09:57.746
Yes, well, that keeps you
out of the garden, doesn't it?


80
00:09:57.979 --> 00:09:59.581
Sorry for the inconvenience.

81
00:09:59.912 --> 00:10:01.218
"Inconvenience"?

82
00:10:01.278 --> 00:10:03.313
What about sorry for
the unmitigated


83
00:10:03.315 --> 00:10:05.019
eco-apocalypse
you've created?


84
00:10:05.245 --> 00:10:07.450
Vernon! The tea!

85
00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:13.586
- Textbook.
- Great.


86
00:10:14.278 --> 00:10:16.381
I hope you enjoy making me ill.

87
00:10:17.278 --> 00:10:20.052
There's only person
responsible for your health.


88
00:10:20.379 --> 00:10:21.448
Yes, you.

89
00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:24.057
Vernon, tea please!

90
00:10:24.112 --> 00:10:26.454
Yeah, okay, all right, all right.
Keep your hair on. Sorry.


91
00:10:26.512 --> 00:10:29.095
Hi, Milly. All
right, stop shouting.


92
00:10:29.097 --> 00:10:30.097
Hi.

93
00:10:31.145 --> 00:10:32.384
There you go, okay.

94
00:10:33.212 --> 00:10:34.554
Cup of tea.

95
00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:37.679
Here, then.

96
00:10:40.112 --> 00:10:41.488
Go on. They're homemade.

97
00:10:43.479 --> 00:10:44.684
All right.

98
00:10:45.046 --> 00:10:46.955
- I've got to go.
- Delicious.


99
00:10:47.345 --> 00:10:50.084
Oh, thank you. Eighty-five
percent cocoa, that's the trick.


100
00:10:50.646 --> 00:10:52.286
And I make them with
oat bran so they're


101
00:10:52.288 --> 00:10:53.648
not so bad here
for his lordship.


102
00:10:54.145 --> 00:10:55.822
You look repellent
in that apron and


103
00:10:55.824 --> 00:10:57.317
you've been wearing
it too long.


104
00:10:57.445 --> 00:10:59.616
See the abuse that I
have to put up with?


105
00:10:59.812 --> 00:11:02.093
If he wasn't so sick, I wouldn't
let him get away with it.


106
00:11:02.145 --> 00:11:04.645
Don't speak to me like that. If you
continue speaking to me like that,


107
00:11:04.646 --> 00:11:06.124
I'm going to quit,
do you understand?


108
00:11:06.145 --> 00:11:08.645
Quite the Celtic Braveheart, aren't
we, when we've got an audience?


109
00:11:08.646 --> 00:11:10.783
He doesn't realize
how important this job is to him.


110
00:11:10.912 --> 00:11:12.803
Anyway, you can
start cleaning the


111
00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:14.857
carpet, thanks to
our unwanted guest.


112
00:11:15.278 --> 00:11:17.018
Yes, any time in the
next 30 seconds.


113
00:11:17.679 --> 00:11:20.247
No, no, no, I've got to go,
I've got to let the babysitter go.


114
00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:22.682
Well, you better start
straightaway, hadn't you?


115
00:11:47.746 --> 00:11:49.087
Bella Brown.

116
00:11:51.612 --> 00:11:53.920
For God's sake, stop
that Gaelic gibberish.


117
00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:02.046
- I'll do it.
- Oh.


118
00:12:02.112 --> 00:12:03.502
No, it's okay.
It's part of my job.


119
00:12:03.504 --> 00:12:04.544
Go on, you'll be late.

120
00:12:04.545 --> 00:12:07.580
Don't be ungracious,
Vernon, thank the girl.


121
00:12:08.512 --> 00:12:10.304
Oh, sorry, thank you.
Erm, it's just


122
00:12:10.306 --> 00:12:11.855
my kids will be
really worried.


123
00:12:12.612 --> 00:12:13.646
Okay.

124
00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:20.723
Slavery was abolished in 1834,
just so you know.


125
00:12:21.345 --> 00:12:24.084
And this country's been
going down the drain ever since.


126
00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:52.384
Hi, Bella, this is Sinead.

127
00:12:52.679 --> 00:12:54.452
This is Niamah. 
Say hi, girls.

128
00:12:54.545 --> 00:12:55.545
- Hi.
- Hi.


129
00:12:55.779 --> 00:12:57.028
So we've come to
cook you breakfast.


130
00:12:57.029 --> 00:12:57.444
What?

131
00:12:57.445 --> 00:12:59.144
Well, it's the least we could do
after last night.


132
00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:00.714
Come on, girls. Come on. In we go.

133
00:13:01.779 --> 00:13:03.279
- Huh.
- There we go.


134
00:13:04.112 --> 00:13:06.386
Okay, girls, will you help me
take out the ingredients?


135
00:13:07.012 --> 00:13:08.811
Oh, it's dark in here,
do you mind if I open these?


136
00:13:08.812 --> 00:13:09.948
Uh...

137
00:13:10.012 --> 00:13:11.637
Well, that's very
thoughtful of you,


138
00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:13.219
Vernon, but there's
really no need.


139
00:13:13.612 --> 00:13:15.715
- Why, have you eaten?
- No.


140
00:13:15.978 --> 00:13:17.354
Well, it's really not a problem,

141
00:13:17.412 --> 00:13:19.711
I'm gonna get the girls picked
up here after breakfast anyway.


142
00:13:19.712 --> 00:13:21.747
So, er, okay,
let's see what we're working with.


143
00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:26.985
Food prison.

144
00:13:28.212 --> 00:13:29.884
I really need to get
ready for work.


145
00:13:30.045 --> 00:13:31.546
Oh, don't let us stop you.

146
00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:33.813
We've got it covered. Off you go.

147
00:13:34.312 --> 00:13:35.483
Okay.

148
00:13:36.278 --> 00:13:38.347
Okay, girls. You pick that up.
Good girl.


149
00:13:38.612 --> 00:13:40.487
You take that one.

150
00:13:56.712 --> 00:13:59.519
Okay, need you
to whack it in there, that's it.


151
00:14:00.545 --> 00:14:01.545
Okay. Well done.

152
00:14:02.812 --> 00:14:05.756
Oh, there's Bella. Hello.

153
00:14:07.846 --> 00:14:08.846
Right.

154
00:14:09.412 --> 00:14:11.083
So, what have we got here?

155
00:14:11.612 --> 00:14:12.783
Mmm-hmm.

156
00:14:13.312 --> 00:14:14.312
Enjoy.

157
00:14:18.078 --> 00:14:19.239
You don't have to eat it all.

158
00:14:19.746 --> 00:14:23.019
Erm, I do make big portions
for the big man next door.


159
00:14:25.078 --> 00:14:28.522
Okay, there's your lift, girls. Oh,
my gosh, look at the time. Okay.


160
00:14:30.812 --> 00:14:32.530
Okay, go on now. Quickly,
quickly, quickly.


161
00:14:34.545 --> 00:14:37.148
Okay, don't fall, slow down please.
Thanks, Jean.


162
00:14:37.945 --> 00:14:39.355
Bye!

163
00:14:44.512 --> 00:14:45.683
All right.

164
00:14:45.978 --> 00:14:47.456
Does their mum take them to school?

165
00:14:49.212 --> 00:14:51.985
No, erm, my wife, er,
passed away, so...


166
00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:57.790
The breakfast is
delicious, thank you.


167
00:14:58.045 --> 00:14:59.045
Oh.

168
00:14:59.779 --> 00:15:01.983
It's a long time
since I heard that.


169
00:15:02.145 --> 00:15:03.555
You're welcome.

170
00:15:03.712 --> 00:15:07.178
Your employer's a bully. I don't
know why you put up with it.


171
00:15:07.245 --> 00:15:10.848
Well, you know, you get used to it
and it pays the rent.


172
00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:15.116
Is that him in the garden?

173
00:15:23.545 --> 00:15:25.988
- No, I can't do it.
- What do you mean you can't do it?


174
00:15:31.445 --> 00:15:33.753
- Ah-ha.
- Do you mind?


175
00:15:34.679 --> 00:15:37.680
You may have won the hearts
of my slow-witted staff,


176
00:15:37.746 --> 00:15:39.087
but not me.

177
00:15:39.679 --> 00:15:41.748
I can't forgive this.

178
00:15:42.345 --> 00:15:45.653
You have squandered
everything nature has given you.


179
00:15:46.212 --> 00:15:47.747
Why are you doing this to me?

180
00:15:47.878 --> 00:15:50.220
It's something
everyone must learn, Miss Brown,


181
00:15:50.278 --> 00:15:51.812
it's called responsibility.

182
00:15:51.878 --> 00:15:53.686
Anathema to you, perhaps,

183
00:15:53.746 --> 00:15:56.121
but it's an important part
of the human condition.


184
00:15:56.178 --> 00:15:58.304
And you, spuds for
brains, are late.


185
00:15:58.306 --> 00:15:59.306
No, I'm not.

186
00:16:07.445 --> 00:16:10.052
You are now. I cannot
tolerate tardiness,


187
00:16:10.054 --> 00:16:12.288
so I won't be paying
you for today.


188
00:16:12.579 --> 00:16:14.579
- I've had enough of this.
- What?


189
00:16:14.712 --> 00:16:16.313
I'm warning you,
Alfie, one more word


190
00:16:16.315 --> 00:16:17.748
and you can shove
your job, yeah?


191
00:16:17.911 --> 00:16:19.184
You're fired.

192
00:16:21.212 --> 00:16:23.883
Okay, will that be
my first verbal warning, then?


193
00:16:23.945 --> 00:16:25.980
You're sacked, Vernon,
end of story.


194
00:16:26.412 --> 00:16:28.578
You've heard of the three-stage
dismissal process, have you?


195
00:16:28.579 --> 00:16:29.613
What?

196
00:16:29.679 --> 00:16:31.678
Let me see, I've been working
with you for five years,


197
00:16:31.679 --> 00:16:34.623
that's a minimum of
five months' paid notice.


198
00:16:34.679 --> 00:16:36.777
I can get you a copy of
the Employment Act, if you want.


199
00:16:36.778 --> 00:16:38.688
You'd be better off rehearsing,

200
00:16:38.745 --> 00:16:41.622
"Would sir like chips with that?"
Save you time.


201
00:16:42.078 --> 00:16:43.420
He could work for me.

202
00:16:44.178 --> 00:16:45.315
- What?
- What?


203
00:16:46.412 --> 00:16:48.912
You could work for
me if you wanted to.


204
00:16:49.512 --> 00:16:51.251
I do, I do want to.

205
00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:54.520
Yeah, I do.

206
00:16:55.345 --> 00:16:57.084
Uh, so, looks like I'm
working here now.


207
00:16:57.145 --> 00:16:58.747
So, you're trespassing.

208
00:16:59.312 --> 00:17:00.983
Well, make the most of it.

209
00:17:02.811 --> 00:17:04.187
You deserve each other.

210
00:17:06.512 --> 00:17:09.955
We'll keep my usual payday,
first of the month, thank you.


211
00:17:14.679 --> 00:17:15.849
Good.

212
00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:27.715
I may have been a little hasty.

213
00:17:29.078 --> 00:17:30.851
No, no, no, it's good, it's good.

214
00:17:31.512 --> 00:17:33.387
It would be a fresh start.

215
00:17:34.778 --> 00:17:36.222
I don't know how I'll pay you.

216
00:17:36.278 --> 00:17:38.620
It's okay.
He'll pay me, so you don't have to.


217
00:17:39.445 --> 00:17:42.082
I'll show that mean old man
what he's missing.


218
00:17:43.012 --> 00:17:44.285
Have you already got a cleaner?

219
00:17:45.445 --> 00:17:46.751
Just me.

220
00:17:47.778 --> 00:17:48.778
Right.

221
00:17:49.445 --> 00:17:51.368
There's "cleaning",
and there's cleaning...


222
00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.117
No, um... Uh,
please don't do that.


223
00:17:53.479 --> 00:17:55.717
There's only some things that

224
00:17:57.811 --> 00:17:59.948
a professional can spot.

225
00:18:03.412 --> 00:18:04.821
Oh, God.

226
00:18:05.811 --> 00:18:07.346
I can't be late for work again.

227
00:18:27.745 --> 00:18:30.087
Please don't touch anything.

228
00:18:30.145 --> 00:18:31.781
Right, let's go.

229
00:18:54.911 --> 00:18:56.946
Sorry, hello. Hello again.

230
00:18:58.611 --> 00:19:01.112
Right, erm, Gian Lorenzo Bernini.

231
00:19:01.545 --> 00:19:03.545
- Sculptural architecture.
- Oh.


232
00:19:03.611 --> 00:19:05.782
Sculpture, of course, every time.

233
00:19:05.845 --> 00:19:08.187
It's the fourth aisle on
your right, top left shelf.


234
00:19:08.245 --> 00:19:09.779
Top left, thank you.

235
00:19:19.611 --> 00:19:21.250
<i>Do you know The Ecstasy
of Saint Theresa?</i>


236
00:19:22.978 --> 00:19:24.683
Uh, yes, I've seen the pictures.

237
00:19:24.745 --> 00:19:26.950
Oh, no, no, no, you must
see it in the flesh.


238
00:19:28.078 --> 00:19:29.249
It's incredible.

239
00:19:29.945 --> 00:19:32.946
He makes tons of
marble simply float.


240
00:19:34.911 --> 00:19:36.855
Defies gravity with beauty.

241
00:19:38.245 --> 00:19:40.245
Destroys logic with emotion.

242
00:19:40.578 --> 00:19:41.578
Psst.

243
00:19:42.978 --> 00:19:44.149
Horticulture.

244
00:19:46.512 --> 00:19:48.251
Sorry.

245
00:20:05.212 --> 00:20:06.451
How is it?

246
00:20:07.212 --> 00:20:08.349
It's wonderful.

247
00:20:08.611 --> 00:20:11.180
Well, the vegetables haven't
been tinned for two decades,


248
00:20:11.445 --> 00:20:13.111
so you might actually be able
to taste them.


249
00:20:13.112 --> 00:20:15.021
Where did you learn
to cook like this?


250
00:20:15.479 --> 00:20:17.150
My mum, God rest her.

251
00:20:17.544 --> 00:20:18.681
Was she a cook?

252
00:20:18.878 --> 00:20:20.356
No, she couldn't cook for toffee.

253
00:20:20.412 --> 00:20:22.287
So, I had to
take matters into my own hands


254
00:20:22.345 --> 00:20:23.981
as soon as I could reach the stove.

255
00:20:26.112 --> 00:20:28.072
Bella, look, there's something
I have to tell you.


256
00:20:32.745 --> 00:20:34.615
I did your laundry
today and I threw


257
00:20:34.617 --> 00:20:36.588
in some of the girls'
stuff and, er...


258
00:20:44.112 --> 00:20:45.112
Oh.

259
00:20:45.645 --> 00:20:47.919
Yeah, I think it was this
little fella to blame.


260
00:20:49.112 --> 00:20:51.521
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.


261
00:20:53.978 --> 00:20:55.217
I'll put them over here.

262
00:20:58.412 --> 00:20:59.889
You all right? Sorry.

263
00:21:12.245 --> 00:21:14.052
<i>Give me back my cook.</i>

264
00:21:15.578 --> 00:21:17.817
- Who is this?
- Your nemesis.


265
00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:22.448
Alfred Stevenson,
your next-door neighbor.


266
00:21:22.778 --> 00:21:24.085
Oh. Hello.

267
00:21:24.379 --> 00:21:25.739
I'm sorry for the inconvenience...

268
00:21:27.045 --> 00:21:29.023
Give me back my cook!

269
00:21:33.278 --> 00:21:34.584
Hello?

270
00:21:50.645 --> 00:21:51.645
Miss Brown?

271
00:21:55.212 --> 00:21:56.848
I haven't got all day, Miss Brown.

272
00:21:57.112 --> 00:22:00.113
I wasn't expecting you until the
start of the month, Mr. O'Brien.


273
00:22:00.411 --> 00:22:01.821
I'm here on urgent
business, Miss


274
00:22:01.823 --> 00:22:03.357
Brown, a matter of
grave importance.


275
00:22:19.845 --> 00:22:23.016
Now, then, let me see,
Flat 2, 6 Primrose Gardens.


276
00:22:23.245 --> 00:22:25.605
I have the appropriate paperwork
pertaining to the property,


277
00:22:25.745 --> 00:22:27.984
and the relevant
photographic documentation to...


278
00:22:30.145 --> 00:22:31.520
Ah!

279
00:22:31.578 --> 00:22:34.749
This is all shipshape, Miss Brown,
very soothing on the eye.


280
00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:35.811
Of course.

281
00:22:35.878 --> 00:22:37.617
But I've received a complaint.

282
00:22:39.312 --> 00:22:41.051
What, from who?

283
00:22:46.778 --> 00:22:48.756
Oh, my word.

284
00:22:50.478 --> 00:22:52.683
This is worse than I expected.

285
00:22:53.478 --> 00:22:56.320
You agreed to keep the property
in sound repair, Miss Brown.


286
00:22:57.745 --> 00:23:00.087
The property, Miss Brown,
includes the garden.


287
00:23:02.845 --> 00:23:04.481
I know.

288
00:23:04.878 --> 00:23:07.981
Uh, I'm not much for the great
outdoors. I'm more of a sort of...


289
00:23:08.045 --> 00:23:09.974
I'm a fair man, but
I am bound by the


290
00:23:09.976 --> 00:23:11.649
law, as detailed
in the contract


291
00:23:11.711 --> 00:23:13.347
signed by your good self.

292
00:23:13.511 --> 00:23:16.785
I have a dislike... More
of a distaste of...


293
00:23:17.312 --> 00:23:19.073
You see, plants and
I don't really get


294
00:23:19.075 --> 00:23:20.654
along, so it's not
really neglect,


295
00:23:20.845 --> 00:23:23.050
it's more of a fear and
loathing, but I...


296
00:23:23.544 --> 00:23:25.181
I promise you I can fix that.

297
00:23:25.745 --> 00:23:27.223
Everything will go back to normal.

298
00:23:27.278 --> 00:23:29.721
Laws are there to
provide boundaries, Miss Brown.


299
00:23:29.778 --> 00:23:32.813
This wanton level of neglect falls
well within your legal obligations


300
00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:35.152
and you are, therefore, in breach.

301
00:23:35.245 --> 00:23:36.551
Good morning.

302
00:23:37.711 --> 00:23:39.950
I'm Vernon, I'm Miss Brown's...

303
00:23:41.112 --> 00:23:42.112
Er, partner.

304
00:23:42.578 --> 00:23:44.215
Gideon O'Brien, landlord.

305
00:23:44.278 --> 00:23:46.653
We were just discussing the
spectacular level of neglect


306
00:23:46.711 --> 00:23:48.921
relating to the 29-foot
north-facing garden


307
00:23:48.923 --> 00:23:50.781
with lawns and
well-stocked borders.


308
00:23:50.845 --> 00:23:52.744
Right, yeah, we're just about to
get into the garden.


309
00:23:52.745 --> 00:23:54.882
Yeah, that's a major priority,
that's top of the list.


310
00:23:54.978 --> 00:23:56.478
I'm afraid it's too late for that.

311
00:23:56.645 --> 00:23:58.926
I shall have to ask you to vacate
by the end of the month.


312
00:24:00.745 --> 00:24:03.087
Were you expecting
Mr. O'Brien this morning?


313
00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:04.650
I wasn't.

314
00:24:04.945 --> 00:24:06.354
Right, and you made an appointment?

315
00:24:06.678 --> 00:24:07.747
I beg your pardon.

316
00:24:07.878 --> 00:24:09.583
Section 34 of the Property Act.

317
00:24:09.645 --> 00:24:11.137
A landlord must
give clear warning


318
00:24:11.139 --> 00:24:12.715
if he wants to inspect
the property.


319
00:24:12.811 --> 00:24:14.276
Very well, we'll come
back later then.


320
00:24:14.277 --> 00:24:15.844
I can't do later,
that's not convenient.


321
00:24:15.845 --> 00:24:19.187
A convenient date must be mutually
agreed, that's Section 17c.


322
00:24:19.245 --> 00:24:20.916
- Tomorrow then?
- Tomorrow's no good.


323
00:24:21.411 --> 00:24:23.719
- Friday?
- Friday...


324
00:24:24.212 --> 00:24:25.314
No, can't do Friday.

325
00:24:25.378 --> 00:24:26.899
- Next Monday.
- Next Monday's no good.


326
00:24:27.212 --> 00:24:28.484
All right then, when?

327
00:24:28.544 --> 00:24:30.954
One calendar month's notice.

328
00:24:31.245 --> 00:24:33.415
Section 17c.

329
00:24:34.112 --> 00:24:35.953
You know that.

330
00:24:38.411 --> 00:24:40.252
There will be
repercussions, Miss Brown.


331
00:24:40.778 --> 00:24:43.881
If this garden is not fixed,
you're out on the street.


332
00:24:45.112 --> 00:24:47.487
You have exactly one
month from today.


333
00:24:55.878 --> 00:24:57.151
What's the matter?

334
00:24:58.078 --> 00:25:01.317
I'm kidding myself, I'm no writer
and I'm certainly no gardener.


335
00:25:01.578 --> 00:25:03.610
What are you talking about,
of course you're a writer.


336
00:25:03.611 --> 00:25:05.180
No, I'm not.

337
00:25:07.711 --> 00:25:10.552
And I'm going to be evicted
and then I'll be homeless


338
00:25:10.611 --> 00:25:12.987
and you'll be unemployed
and it's all my fault.


339
00:25:13.145 --> 00:25:14.679
Oh, I see.

340
00:25:15.012 --> 00:25:17.143
You're feeling
sorry for yourself.


341
00:25:17.145 --> 00:25:18.145
No.

342
00:25:19.544 --> 00:25:22.215
I mean, you have to look at the
facts, you have to weigh it up.


343
00:25:23.344 --> 00:25:25.253
- What?
- Stand up.


344
00:25:28.611 --> 00:25:30.089
Go on.

345
00:25:34.311 --> 00:25:36.119
Okay, stay still, I
don't want to hurt you.


346
00:25:50.945 --> 00:25:52.980
When was the last
time you were hugged?


347
00:25:55.711 --> 00:25:58.019
- It's been a while.
- Yeah.


348
00:26:00.344 --> 00:26:01.845
Right, get on with it.

349
00:27:40.911 --> 00:27:43.821
<i>Lonicera Aureoreticulata .</i>

350
00:27:44.478 --> 00:27:46.285
"Honeysuckle" to you.

351
00:27:46.444 --> 00:27:48.202
Although personally I
think they look better


352
00:27:48.204 --> 00:27:49.922
when they are attached
to the plant itself.


353
00:27:50.311 --> 00:27:53.619
And, look, right
next it, Delphinium.


354
00:27:53.945 --> 00:27:56.359
Great big iridescent
blue flowers before


355
00:27:56.361 --> 00:27:58.481
you cut them up
into little pieces.


356
00:27:59.811 --> 00:28:02.092
I think they were
the last living


357
00:28:02.094 --> 00:28:04.779
things in your
horticultural graveyard.


358
00:28:04.845 --> 00:28:06.754
I was just trying
to tidy up a bit.

359
00:28:07.211 --> 00:28:09.780
I think that's what Hitler said
about Europe.


360
00:28:10.277 --> 00:28:12.255
Anyway, enough of this small talk,

361
00:28:12.611 --> 00:28:14.145
give me back my cook.

362
00:28:14.678 --> 00:28:16.212
What? No.

363
00:28:17.044 --> 00:28:19.318
Give him back! I need him.

364
00:28:19.378 --> 00:28:21.140
Well, you should
have thought about


365
00:28:21.142 --> 00:28:23.050
that before you treated
him like dirt.


366
00:28:23.478 --> 00:28:24.478
Stop it...

367
00:28:24.778 --> 00:28:27.153
Don't act like a little girl,
give me my cook back.


368
00:28:28.077 --> 00:28:29.885
- Give him back!
- Can't hear you.


369
00:28:29.945 --> 00:28:31.445
What the hell is wrong with you?

370
00:28:35.645 --> 00:28:37.554
You could come and help, you know.

371
00:28:37.611 --> 00:28:40.612
Oh, I'm sorry, I
would, but hay fever.


372
00:28:41.511 --> 00:28:45.011
Chronic allergies,
my head swells up like a pumpkin.


373
00:28:45.077 --> 00:28:47.146
I'm no use to man or
beast, I'm sorry.


374
00:28:47.578 --> 00:28:48.749
There you go.

375
00:28:50.244 --> 00:28:51.986
It may look like a
simple quiche and


376
00:28:51.988 --> 00:28:53.587
salad, but the
balsamic reduction


377
00:28:53.645 --> 00:28:55.760
and the onion glaze
elevates it to


378
00:28:55.762 --> 00:28:58.056
something altogether
more satisfying.


379
00:28:58.911 --> 00:29:00.013
Enjoy.

380
00:29:28.044 --> 00:29:31.113
<i>I didn't want to have
to spell it out to you,</i>


381
00:29:32.277 --> 00:29:33.914
<i>but I'm a dying man.</i>

382
00:29:34.645 --> 00:29:39.055
<i>Unlike you, I don't have long left.
Time is my enemy.</i>


383
00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:40.888
<i>I mourn every minute.</i>

384
00:29:41.778 --> 00:29:45.745
<i>Every precious second
marks my life draining away.</i>


385
00:29:46.411 --> 00:29:48.286
That's dreadful, 
I had no idea...

386
00:29:48.344 --> 00:29:50.015
<i>I don't have much
to give me comfort,</i>


387
00:29:50.077 --> 00:29:52.612
<i>no friends, no family,
no one to love.</i>


388
00:29:52.944 --> 00:29:54.684
<i>I only have the beauty of nature</i>

389
00:29:55.244 --> 00:29:57.983
<i>and the promise of a
hearty last meal.</i>


390
00:29:58.578 --> 00:30:02.283
<i>{beg you, send Vernon home to me</i>

391
00:30:02.911 --> 00:30:05.354
<i>and we can put all this
silly mess behind us.</i>


392
00:30:05.678 --> 00:30:07.417
I had no idea you were so ill.

393
00:30:07.478 --> 00:30:09.752
- I'm so sorry, I can talk...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.


394
00:30:09.911 --> 00:30:12.218
- What are you doing?
- Don't listen to that.


395
00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:15.649
He's dying, why didn't you tell me?

396
00:30:15.711 --> 00:30:18.018
That old coot's been dying
for the last 10 years.


397
00:30:18.144 --> 00:30:19.144
Vernon!

398
00:30:19.411 --> 00:30:21.753
Okay, let me guess, was it, erm...

399
00:30:22.645 --> 00:30:24.850
"Time is my enemy.

400
00:30:25.378 --> 00:30:28.845
"I mourn every minute,
I mourn every second."


401
00:30:28.944 --> 00:30:30.149
Or was it,

402
00:30:30.578 --> 00:30:35.215
"I have no friends, I have no
family, I have nothing, nothing."


403
00:30:36.177 --> 00:30:37.587
He used both.

404
00:30:37.645 --> 00:30:39.816
Oh, hey. So, he's
getting desperate.


405
00:31:03.177 --> 00:31:04.246
Perfect.

406
00:31:22.144 --> 00:31:24.985
It's shut, it's bloody shut.

407
00:31:52.711 --> 00:31:55.689
Sorry, Miss Bramble, problem
with the buses this morning.


408
00:31:55.745 --> 00:31:59.188
Mmm, I think our problem is with
you, not with public transport.


409
00:31:59.244 --> 00:32:00.722
And I wouldn't be making this point

410
00:32:00.778 --> 00:32:03.255
if your tardiness was
not pathological.


411
00:32:04.478 --> 00:32:07.944
So sorry, hate to interrupt,
looking for Herculaneum Parma.


412
00:32:08.645 --> 00:32:10.680
"Lamperna..." Er...

413
00:32:10.745 --> 00:32:13.881
"Architecture", back wall on
your right, third shelf down.


414
00:32:14.378 --> 00:32:15.583
Thank you.

415
00:32:15.944 --> 00:32:17.944
We also have a book
on his early illustrations.


416
00:32:18.177 --> 00:32:20.814
That's exactly what I'm looking
for, thank you so much.


417
00:32:21.544 --> 00:32:23.044
You're welcome.

418
00:32:26.277 --> 00:32:27.380
Hmm.

419
00:32:30.745 --> 00:32:34.086
Oh. Goodbye, Miss.
Thank you again for earlier.


420
00:32:34.645 --> 00:32:36.918
Oh, it's nothing, really.

421
00:32:37.244 --> 00:32:39.881
What's your name, by the way?
Don't know what to call you.


422
00:32:40.044 --> 00:32:41.215
Shh!

423
00:32:42.378 --> 00:32:43.821
It's Bella.

424
00:32:44.177 --> 00:32:45.416
Bella Brown.

425
00:32:45.745 --> 00:32:49.416
Well, I'm William. William Tranter,
but everyone calls me Billy.


426
00:32:51.745 --> 00:32:53.222
See you soon, Bella.

427
00:32:57.311 --> 00:32:58.550
Billy.

428
00:32:59.777 --> 00:33:01.278
Billy Tranter.

429
00:33:17.144 --> 00:33:18.815
Excuse me, young lady.

430
00:33:22.044 --> 00:33:24.113
Would you be so kind
as to point me to the section


431
00:33:24.177 --> 00:33:26.246
that deals with home cookery?

432
00:33:26.711 --> 00:33:29.984
Certainly, sir,
it's the third aisle on your left,


433
00:33:30.044 --> 00:33:31.545
lower two shelves on your right.

434
00:33:31.611 --> 00:33:32.917
Thank you, very helpful.

435
00:33:32.977 --> 00:33:35.955
We have recently received
Walker Owens' latest.


436
00:33:36.578 --> 00:33:37.816
<i>Dinner for One,</i>

437
00:33:38.444 --> 00:33:41.422
<i>Simple Joy and the
Classic Simple Recipes</i>


438
00:33:41.478 --> 00:33:45.149
for <i>Solo</i> Dining, which
is always popular.


439
00:33:45.678 --> 00:33:46.678
Thank you, very helpful.

440
00:33:47.011 --> 00:33:48.216
We do try to be of assistance.

441
00:33:48.378 --> 00:33:50.185
Well, the best assistance would be

442
00:33:50.244 --> 00:33:51.244
to give me back

443
00:33:51.311 --> 00:33:53.093
my bloody Irishman,
you heartless...


444
00:33:53.095 --> 00:33:54.095
Shh!

445
00:33:54.645 --> 00:33:56.762
This library is a
refuge for learning


446
00:33:56.764 --> 00:33:58.714
and requires silence
at all times.


447
00:33:58.877 --> 00:34:00.219
Oh, "Learning"?

448
00:34:00.344 --> 00:34:03.787
Well, then how is it your employees
have learned nothing of compassion


449
00:34:03.977 --> 00:34:05.580
for their starving fellow man,

450
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.552
for the hungry, aged and decrepit,

451
00:34:07.611 --> 00:34:10.214
the forgotten generation
that made this country great...


452
00:34:10.277 --> 00:34:11.653
Get out.

453
00:34:12.011 --> 00:34:14.421
Get out immediately
or I'm calling the police.


454
00:34:14.478 --> 00:34:16.080
Excellent, have her arrested.

455
00:34:16.211 --> 00:34:19.087
She murders flora
that keep this planet alive.


456
00:34:19.244 --> 00:34:20.983
Be silent and leave!

457
00:34:43.944 --> 00:34:45.785
I'd stick to writing if I were you.

458
00:34:46.011 --> 00:34:49.716
Oh, just tell me what I should be
doing, you horrid wretched old man.


459
00:34:50.644 --> 00:34:52.418
Why should I furnish
you with that advice?


460
00:34:52.578 --> 00:34:53.919
I've got three weeks

461
00:34:53.977 --> 00:34:55.018
to turn this garden around

462
00:34:55.044 --> 00:34:57.113
or I'll wind up
sleeping in the park.


463
00:34:57.511 --> 00:34:58.681
Is everything okay?

464
00:34:58.744 --> 00:35:02.188
I am trying my best here,

465
00:35:02.244 --> 00:35:05.154
I want to make a difference, and
if you had an ounce of humanity,


466
00:35:05.211 --> 00:35:07.779
you wouldn't just stand there
gloating at me, you would help me.


467
00:35:10.411 --> 00:35:11.888
All right, I'll help.

468
00:35:12.244 --> 00:35:13.586
- You will?
- Yes.


469
00:35:14.011 --> 00:35:15.580
Now you give me back my cook.

470
00:35:15.844 --> 00:35:17.151
- No.
- Yes.


471
00:35:17.211 --> 00:35:19.450
He's not a slave, he's
not mine to give.


472
00:35:19.511 --> 00:35:21.647
If you had treated
him like a person...


473
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:23.345
Okay, okay, okay,
I'll cook your


474
00:35:23.347 --> 00:35:25.178
meals, you vituperative
old bastard.


475
00:35:26.077 --> 00:35:27.350
Excellent.

476
00:35:27.411 --> 00:35:30.287
And five syllables, Vernon,
I didn't know you had it in you.


477
00:35:30.344 --> 00:35:32.617
But I won't set foot
inside that house.


478
00:35:32.677 --> 00:35:34.696
Well, I'm not going to
eat scraps out of a


479
00:35:34.698 --> 00:35:36.622
plastic container like
some trainspotter


480
00:35:36.844 --> 00:35:38.516
on a windy platform in Runcorn.

481
00:35:38.644 --> 00:35:40.447
I'll cook your meals,
you help her fix


482
00:35:40.449 --> 00:35:42.112
up the garden, that
way we all win.


483
00:35:43.478 --> 00:35:45.183
Take it or leave it, Alfie.

484
00:35:47.511 --> 00:35:49.147
I'll take it.

485
00:36:11.044 --> 00:36:12.734
Okay, house rules,
breakfast at 8:00,


486
00:36:12.736 --> 00:36:14.114
lunch at 1:00,
dinner at 6:00.


487
00:36:14.177 --> 00:36:15.976
Meals will be left here
at exactly those times


488
00:36:15.977 --> 00:36:17.852
and then I'm going to
ring this bell twice,


489
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:19.581
so you know you can retrieve them.

490
00:36:19.744 --> 00:36:21.665
I'll leave serving
instructions if necessary so I


491
00:36:21.667 --> 00:36:23.509
don't have to hear your
voice or see your face.


492
00:36:23.511 --> 00:36:24.782
Yes, but what if...

493
00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:40.288
<i>Creating a garden
starts as an interest</i>


494
00:36:40.344 --> 00:36:43.117
<i>and soon becomes a
lifetime's obsession.</i>


495
00:36:44.277 --> 00:36:47.016
<i>One that can be engaged
at a moment's notice.</i>


496
00:36:49.478 --> 00:36:51.751
"By simply stepping outside."

497
00:37:22.378 --> 00:37:24.763
"A true gardener
can create more


498
00:37:24.765 --> 00:37:27.584
happiness propagating
life in one seed


499
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:30.252
"and seeing that
single flower unfold


500
00:37:30.677 --> 00:37:35.088
"than the rich man could ever get
from his perfect rolling lawns."


501
00:37:36.677 --> 00:37:39.587
I've never known him to let that
book out of his sight before.


502
00:37:48.444 --> 00:37:50.046
Thank you so much for the book.

503
00:37:50.877 --> 00:37:53.014
- I love the illustrations.
- You read it?


504
00:37:53.244 --> 00:37:54.449
Every word.

505
00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.704
<i>So, what are you
talking to me for?</i>


506
00:37:56.706 --> 00:37:58.915
<i>Get to work or O'Brien
will have you out.</i>


507
00:38:17.244 --> 00:38:19.051
What now?

508
00:38:19.111 --> 00:38:21.748
Now, you dig.

509
00:38:41.044 --> 00:38:43.612
Vernon, can you hear me?

510
00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:47.547
What?

511
00:38:48.977 --> 00:38:52.546
No black pudding with my breakfast
this morning, my Irish friend.


512
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:55.754
Yeah, fine.

513
00:39:06.577 --> 00:39:09.021
- Did you read the book?
- I did.


514
00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:12.786
What's this?

515
00:39:14.277 --> 00:39:15.583
Soil.

516
00:39:16.144 --> 00:39:19.553
If you leave the roots of the weeds
in the soil,


517
00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:22.179
they'll grow back
before you even finish digging.


518
00:39:22.543 --> 00:39:25.817
They'll strangle the life
out of your new creation.


519
00:39:25.877 --> 00:39:28.787
It's just like a time
bomb waiting to go off.


520
00:39:29.144 --> 00:39:32.644
Dig it all again,
sieve out the roots.


521
00:39:51.744 --> 00:39:53.313
I need my bed.

522
00:40:26.443 --> 00:40:28.352
It's about bloody time.

523
00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:30.252
A man could die of
starvation in this place.


524
00:40:48.144 --> 00:40:49.985
- Billy.
- Bella.


525
00:40:50.944 --> 00:40:52.047
Silence.

526
00:40:52.577 --> 00:40:54.646
Sorry.

527
00:41:04.644 --> 00:41:06.986
You know, I believed
those things you said.


528
00:41:14.443 --> 00:41:16.387
Why would you say that?

529
00:41:16.477 --> 00:41:19.944
Vernon told me how many times
he's heard the exact same stories.


530
00:41:20.744 --> 00:41:22.245
Shame on you.

531
00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:25.345
You should doubt only a man
who changes his story.


532
00:41:27.211 --> 00:41:30.780
I only repeat myself
in the vague hope that one day


533
00:41:31.577 --> 00:41:34.021
somebody will actually hear me.

534
00:41:39.644 --> 00:41:42.315
Breathtaking, isn't it?

535
00:41:42.377 --> 00:41:44.049
Come, come, come.

536
00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:49.611
<i>Like sparks falling
from a giant furnace.</i>


537
00:41:50.844 --> 00:41:54.652
In some countries they hold
parties when it starts to rain.


538
00:41:54.844 --> 00:41:58.845
But here, we just scurry around
and run for cover.


539
00:42:01.977 --> 00:42:04.511
It's the most important currency
in the world,


540
00:42:04.577 --> 00:42:06.803
and yet, in our
green and pleasant


541
00:42:06.805 --> 00:42:09.283
land where we take
so much for granted


542
00:42:09.377 --> 00:42:14.515
we see it only as a means
of ruining expensive hairdos


543
00:42:14.577 --> 00:42:17.146
and making taxi drivers rich.

544
00:42:17.877 --> 00:42:19.320
You're odd.

545
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:21.216
Says she.

546
00:42:26.011 --> 00:42:27.511
Here.

547
00:42:31.177 --> 00:42:34.245
Ailanthus, giant sunflower.

548
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:38.811
Start off with them,
incredibly beautiful.


549
00:42:39.276 --> 00:42:42.084
They need a lot of light and heat.

550
00:42:43.477 --> 00:42:45.955
They follow the arc of the sun

551
00:42:46.111 --> 00:42:50.612
from dawn until dusk, extracting
maximum energy from every day.


552
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:53.988
It's a very, very clever flower.

553
00:42:56.677 --> 00:42:58.655
Think about that.

554
00:43:37.844 --> 00:43:39.913
I think there might be
a garden here, after all.


555
00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:46.055
Arthur's book, it's gripping,
where did you get it?


556
00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:49.847
He was a friend of mine.

557
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:52.615
Dear old Arthur showed me the
path to true enlightenment


558
00:43:52.677 --> 00:43:55.484
and then took me on an
incredible journey.


559
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:58.478
Well, look after it, it's
the only one I've got.


560
00:43:58.577 --> 00:44:00.111
I'm amazed you trusted me with it.

561
00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:01.988
So am I.

562
00:44:03.844 --> 00:44:06.287
I bet even Arthur would have
been daunted by this garden.


563
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:08.354
No, he would have relished it.

564
00:44:10.011 --> 00:44:13.853
Totally blank canvas, chance to
create your own masterpiece.


565
00:44:15.377 --> 00:44:17.821
Come. Come on, follow me.

566
00:44:22.744 --> 00:44:24.881
How do we make a garden?

567
00:44:30.076 --> 00:44:32.452
How do we build a color palette?

568
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:34.988
How do we create depth and texture?

569
00:44:35.076 --> 00:44:37.918
How do we keep interest
from April to October?


570
00:44:37.977 --> 00:44:41.147
Well, we start
with these stunning foxgloves,


571
00:44:42.011 --> 00:44:44.181
and these alliums.

572
00:44:45.276 --> 00:44:47.254
Come on. Come, come, come.

573
00:44:51.343 --> 00:44:54.287
<i>And then we go on to these mamas</i>

574
00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:57.547
and these dahlias so colorful
they hurt your eyes.


575
00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:01.281
And these gloriously purple salvias

576
00:45:01.343 --> 00:45:04.685
that go on flowering
until the frost claims them.


577
00:45:04.977 --> 00:45:10.216
Then the Verbascum,
and we've got the evening primrose


578
00:45:10.276 --> 00:45:13.948
and those deliciously green
shuttlecock ferns.


579
00:45:14.644 --> 00:45:18.918
And, look, clambering
climbing clematis,


580
00:45:19.844 --> 00:45:22.720
the sweet rocket, and, look,

581
00:45:24.543 --> 00:45:28.715
these monkswood so beautiful
and poisonous they'll kill a man.


582
00:45:29.343 --> 00:45:32.082
That's an interesting
contradiction, isn't it?


583
00:45:33.276 --> 00:45:36.777
That lily, golden splendor,

584
00:45:36.877 --> 00:45:40.013
persicaria, nicotiana,

585
00:45:40.777 --> 00:45:42.618
and hollyhocks. Come.

586
00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:49.151
Begonias.

587
00:45:50.143 --> 00:45:52.280
Magnificent agapanthus.

588
00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:57.150
And, well, the list is endless.

589
00:45:58.744 --> 00:46:03.017
It's a world of beautifully
ordered chaos.


590
00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.488
That's chaos, not calamity,
Miss Brown,


591
00:46:06.543 --> 00:46:09.111
because if you don't
understand the difference,


592
00:46:09.176 --> 00:46:10.711
then we won't progress very far.

593
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:12.510
We?

594
00:46:13.577 --> 00:46:14.577
What?

595
00:46:14.944 --> 00:46:16.421
<i>You said, "We."</i>

596
00:46:16.477 --> 00:46:18.284
No, that's ridiculous.

597
00:47:21.877 --> 00:47:24.480
Two weeks to turn this
into a garden.


598
00:47:49.477 --> 00:47:50.648
Bella?

599
00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:53.253
Everything all right?

600
00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:55.913
Yes, of course,
I'm just letting off some steam.


601
00:47:56.477 --> 00:47:57.648
Ah. I see.

602
00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:02.883
So, what brings you here?

603
00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:05.412
I come here every Sunday.

604
00:48:05.477 --> 00:48:08.318
I see. To scream and shout
and exhale the week?


605
00:48:08.377 --> 00:48:09.514
Yes.

606
00:48:11.976 --> 00:48:15.079
- And feed Sid.
- Which one's Sid?


607
00:48:15.976 --> 00:48:17.352
The scruffy one.

608
00:48:19.909 --> 00:48:22.319
Well, I bet he was a
looker in his day.


609
00:48:22.443 --> 00:48:23.943
Mmm. He was.

610
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:29.081
Are you here to work?

611
00:48:29.143 --> 00:48:31.950
Oh. No, goodness, no,
I've just come to sketch,


612
00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:34.784
doodle, think, work things out.

613
00:48:35.143 --> 00:48:37.712
Erm, I invent things,
I'm a designer.


614
00:48:38.243 --> 00:48:40.811
Numbers and working parts,
that's my specialty.


615
00:48:40.943 --> 00:48:43.649
These ideas, they sort of come out
faster than I can cope sometimes.


616
00:48:43.809 --> 00:48:45.481
Pure left-brainer.

617
00:48:45.744 --> 00:48:47.153
I'm more of a no-brainer.

618
00:48:47.276 --> 00:48:49.584
I don't believe that for a second.

619
00:48:50.377 --> 00:48:54.048
You seem to know so much, every
book, every author, every shelf.


620
00:48:54.677 --> 00:48:57.018
I'm only working there
until my book gets published.


621
00:48:57.543 --> 00:49:00.146
Oh, how exciting. 
What's it about?

622
00:49:02.677 --> 00:49:05.712
It's a children's book,
but it doesn't really...


623
00:49:05.777 --> 00:49:07.482
Well, what I mean is...

624
00:49:08.909 --> 00:49:10.853
Doesn't really have a
story at the moment.


625
00:49:11.343 --> 00:49:12.685
Oh, how novel.

626
00:49:15.443 --> 00:49:17.045
Um, sorry, er, tea?

627
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:21.552
Thank you.

628
00:49:27.976 --> 00:49:29.010
Ah.

629
00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:32.284
I like your mechanical bird thing.

630
00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:36.286
How on Earth do you
know about that?


631
00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:40.113
The other day, in the library,
you left a piece of paper.


632
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:41.510
Oh.

633
00:49:42.176 --> 00:49:45.620
Right, yes, I see,
erm, my mechanical bird thing, yes.


634
00:49:48.276 --> 00:49:50.879
- Well, I really ought to...
- Would you like to see it?


635
00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:52.780
My bird thing.

636
00:49:52.843 --> 00:49:55.651
Well, I only, er, live
a few minutes away.


637
00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:57.110
- It's not far.
- I really should...


638
00:49:57.176 --> 00:49:58.518
No one else has seen it yet.

639
00:49:58.577 --> 00:49:59.883
No one else has been invited.

640
00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:03.418
- No, I really should...
- It would be rude to say no.


641
00:50:07.276 --> 00:50:08.810
- I suppose I...
- Excellent.


642
00:50:08.876 --> 00:50:11.717
Come on, I'm, erm, just round here.

643
00:50:27.043 --> 00:50:28.612
- Here we are.
- Wow!


644
00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:35.917
When my parents died,
they left George the town house,


645
00:50:35.976 --> 00:50:37.976
Edward got the cottage
and I got this.


646
00:50:38.143 --> 00:50:39.553
It's incredible.

647
00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:43.110
Part of the joys of being the
eldest, I got first pick.


648
00:50:44.843 --> 00:50:46.412
Here we go.

649
00:50:48.543 --> 00:50:49.577
Ah!

650
00:50:49.644 --> 00:50:51.246
Right. Now...

651
00:50:52.443 --> 00:50:53.443
Uh...

652
00:50:54.776 --> 00:50:57.118
This is Sergis, he's
particularly interesting.


653
00:50:57.176 --> 00:51:01.348
I've made the body of a tortoise
with the engine of a hare.


654
00:51:04.709 --> 00:51:06.687
He still needs a bit
of work though.


655
00:51:06.743 --> 00:51:10.085
Um... And then over here...

656
00:51:10.143 --> 00:51:11.348
Um...

657
00:51:12.676 --> 00:51:13.676
Ah-ha!

658
00:51:13.743 --> 00:51:15.721
Now for the main event.

659
00:51:17.377 --> 00:51:18.786
This.

660
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:21.653
This is Luna.

661
00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:38.281
She's powered by light.

662
00:51:39.043 --> 00:51:41.521
- Solar powered?
- Even moonlight.


663
00:51:44.909 --> 00:51:46.319
Hence, Luna.

664
00:51:47.043 --> 00:51:48.544
Hence, Luna.

665
00:51:57.210 --> 00:51:58.653
I love her.

666
00:51:58.776 --> 00:52:00.220
I'm so glad.

667
00:52:01.809 --> 00:52:03.787
Well, you're the writer, Bella,

668
00:52:03.876 --> 00:52:05.377
tell me a story about Luna.

669
00:52:11.909 --> 00:52:13.648
Luna couldn't always fly, you know.

670
00:52:14.243 --> 00:52:16.221
No? Why not?

671
00:52:20.909 --> 00:52:23.978
Well, long ago, before
the world was round,


672
00:52:24.043 --> 00:52:28.044
Luna and the rest of her species
inhabited a remote forest.


673
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:32.484
They had tiny little wings,

674
00:52:33.876 --> 00:52:35.581
but were flightless.

675
00:52:36.776 --> 00:52:39.720
They foraged around
on the forest floor


676
00:52:41.543 --> 00:52:44.521
and kept themselves
very much to themselves.


677
00:52:48.843 --> 00:52:52.344
Luna lost her parents
at a very early age.


678
00:52:56.310 --> 00:52:58.345
They were taken from Luna

679
00:52:59.809 --> 00:53:01.378
just like that,

680
00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:03.781
no explanation.

681
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:10.411
Barely out of the nest,
she was too young to know anything.


682
00:53:12.943 --> 00:53:15.251
She was such a warrior.

683
00:53:16.443 --> 00:53:18.079
Only coming out for food briefly

684
00:53:18.143 --> 00:53:21.212
when all the other animals
had gone to sleep, and the...


685
00:53:22.809 --> 00:53:25.810
The forest floor was
bathed in moonlight.


686
00:53:29.343 --> 00:53:31.378
She was such a scrawny
little thing.


687
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:34.851
A loner.

688
00:53:38.276 --> 00:53:44.118
Well, life was passing by until one
day Luna saw a kindly traveler


689
00:53:45.076 --> 00:53:50.384
holding a thing of great wonder
and beauty and...


690
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:52.546
And...

691
00:53:55.809 --> 00:53:57.219
And what?

692
00:53:59.909 --> 00:54:02.750
And that's it. For now.

693
00:54:05.443 --> 00:54:07.511
But I'd like to know
what happens next.


694
00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:10.912
So do I.

695
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:24.249
Are you kicking me, Mr. Stevenson?

696
00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:25.787
No.

697
00:54:25.843 --> 00:54:28.719
I'm encouraging you to get up.

698
00:54:28.776 --> 00:54:31.811
If you ignore my encouragement,
then I'll start kicking you.


699
00:54:33.542 --> 00:54:35.452
This garden is taking forever.

700
00:54:35.676 --> 00:54:39.348
Well, everything that
matters takes time.


701
00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:42.886
You can speed-read,
but you can't speed-garden.


702
00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:45.088
Try telling that to O'Brien.

703
00:54:46.976 --> 00:54:48.510
Look at that. Look.

704
00:54:52.843 --> 00:54:54.185
What's that?

705
00:54:54.243 --> 00:54:58.880
It's called <i>Fragaria Virginians.</i>
It's a wild strawberry.


706
00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:05.552
Life and nature, it's just waiting
to burst out anywhere it can,


707
00:55:05.609 --> 00:55:08.587
seeking the light,
getting on with it.


708
00:55:09.043 --> 00:55:10.418
It's very simple.

709
00:55:11.743 --> 00:55:13.914
Must have been buried under
a ton of rubbish.


710
00:55:14.576 --> 00:55:17.747
Hmm. Isn't it always like that?

711
00:55:20.743 --> 00:55:22.880
- Now you can see...
- Wait, wait. What?


712
00:55:23.143 --> 00:55:25.552
You can even see the
pictures of it,


713
00:55:25.609 --> 00:55:27.780
sometimes, while you can manage...

714
00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:32.145
- Now you see?
- Really far away and then...


715
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:34.085
Really far away...

716
00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:08.812
Ah, yes, I should have warned you.

717
00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:11.051
Laundry was never
Vernon's strong point.


718
00:56:12.709 --> 00:56:13.880
I've got something for you.

719
00:56:14.143 --> 00:56:16.416
Queen Victoria wore
more color than you.


720
00:56:16.476 --> 00:56:19.114
I always feel I'm at a
funeral when you're around.


721
00:56:19.176 --> 00:56:20.245
Charming.

722
00:56:22.176 --> 00:56:23.676
So, have you given this
much thought?


723
00:56:23.809 --> 00:56:26.009
Well, it should get around
five hours of sunlight a day,


724
00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:28.613
I've given it the minimum depth of
two feet for the lilies,


725
00:56:28.676 --> 00:56:30.567
and other aquatic
plants, with a


726
00:56:30.569 --> 00:56:32.746
one-foot overhang
all the way around.


727
00:56:33.076 --> 00:56:35.209
And Vernon's going to help
with the filter and the pump.


728
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:37.188
What's he going to do,
cover them in puff pastry?


729
00:56:38.376 --> 00:56:40.336
How quickly do you think
we could put the fish in?


730
00:56:40.576 --> 00:56:43.145
Well, personally, I'd wait
until there was water in there.


731
00:56:43.743 --> 00:56:45.016
But approximately how soon?

732
00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:46.687
- Miss Brown.
- Yes?


733
00:56:46.776 --> 00:56:47.776
Just dig.

734
00:56:57.043 --> 00:56:59.384
Well... You're much better.

735
00:56:59.709 --> 00:57:02.585
Yes, well, that's because I take
all that unnecessary medication


736
00:57:02.643 --> 00:57:04.144
that you force-feed me.

737
00:57:04.476 --> 00:57:06.818
A-ha!

738
00:57:06.876 --> 00:57:08.785
- What on Earth is that?
- Room service.


739
00:57:08.876 --> 00:57:10.979
Breakfast is in the
shed, come on, hurry.


740
00:57:17.909 --> 00:57:18.909
Oh, hello, Milly.

741
00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:21.815
This is the most bizarre thing
I've ever seen.


742
00:57:22.342 --> 00:57:24.377
Well, it's the only way
he's going to eat my food.


743
00:57:25.176 --> 00:57:28.813
His lordship would like to know
if there's any black pudding.


744
00:57:28.976 --> 00:57:30.147
No.

745
00:57:30.776 --> 00:57:34.948
Tell him they ran out, and it's
bad for his cholesterol anyway.


746
00:57:35.342 --> 00:57:37.411
You of all people should know that.

747
00:57:39.643 --> 00:57:41.450
But don't you dare tell him
I said that.


748
00:57:48.342 --> 00:57:49.376
Hmm.

749
00:57:49.442 --> 00:57:51.477
Are you going to explain
what's going on?


750
00:57:51.542 --> 00:57:52.542
No.

751
00:58:08.709 --> 00:58:10.846
- Mr. Stevenson.
- Yes?


752
00:58:11.110 --> 00:58:13.190
Can I ask you a
personal question?


753
00:58:13.192 --> 00:58:13.942
No.

754
00:58:13.943 --> 00:58:15.784
- Please.
- No.


755
00:58:16.143 --> 00:58:17.381
Ask me one then.

756
00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:19.380
Definitely not.

757
00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:21.044
Why not?

758
00:58:21.110 --> 00:58:22.246
I don't want to prod around

759
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:25.549
in your obsessive little world
any more than I have to.


760
00:58:25.643 --> 00:58:26.985
I'm speechless.

761
00:58:27.043 --> 00:58:29.611
If only that were true.
Now, shut up and dig.


762
00:58:30.643 --> 00:58:31.848
I can't.

763
00:58:32.242 --> 00:58:33.345
Why not?

764
00:58:35.242 --> 00:58:36.345
It's done.

765
00:58:39.643 --> 00:58:40.848
Well?

766
00:58:41.176 --> 00:58:42.244
"Well" what?

767
00:58:43.442 --> 00:58:45.943
Aren't you going to thank me
for all my hard work?


768
00:58:46.909 --> 00:58:49.183
Uh, you'll come for tea at 4:00.

769
00:59:09.943 --> 00:59:11.352
This is beautiful.

770
00:59:12.043 --> 00:59:13.543
Fantastic.

771
00:59:16.143 --> 00:59:18.711
When I was younger,
I did a lot of traveling.


772
00:59:19.076 --> 00:59:22.713
I collected seeds
from the most spectacular plants.


773
00:59:23.209 --> 00:59:25.517
Each one is from a
different country.


774
00:59:26.076 --> 00:59:28.849
Different color, different smell,

775
00:59:29.909 --> 00:59:36.081
and most importantly,
different memory.


776
00:59:36.609 --> 00:59:42.417
I spend my days breathing life
into these wonderful things.


777
00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:50.348
- Where are these from?
- Iran.


778
00:59:51.376 --> 00:59:53.537
Uh, I found them on a mountainside
overlooking the sea.


779
00:59:54.843 --> 00:59:56.218
Will you tell me about it?

780
00:59:58.576 --> 00:59:59.781
Uh, here. Here.

781
01:00:00.643 --> 01:00:01.916
Take these.

782
01:00:02.175 --> 01:00:05.551
They're rather old, but fine
quality. Do them justice.


783
01:00:06.076 --> 01:00:08.094
But I... I don't
really know how to...


784
01:00:08.096 --> 01:00:09.646
No, don't think, just do.

785
01:00:12.509 --> 01:00:14.180
So, where was I?

786
01:00:15.909 --> 01:00:16.978
Iran.

787
01:00:17.342 --> 01:00:20.649
Oh, yes. In the province
of Mazandaran on


788
01:00:20.651 --> 01:00:23.720
the southern shore
of the Caspian Sea.


789
01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:25.988
Which is in fact the
world's biggest lake.


790
01:00:26.043 --> 01:00:29.248
Uh, which is in fact
your last interruption, young lady.


791
01:00:30.242 --> 01:00:34.016
I was walking through a field
that seemed endless,


792
01:00:34.076 --> 01:00:39.452
and all around was this
blanket of deep red peonies.


793
01:00:41.242 --> 01:00:43.481
Though, anyway, let me go back.
I...


794
01:00:44.109 --> 01:00:47.849
It was July when I arrived in
Tehran, and it was bloody hot.


795
01:00:48.776 --> 01:00:51.686
And it was very grand
in those days, Tehran.


796
01:01:11.175 --> 01:01:12.278
This is disgraceful.

797
01:01:12.943 --> 01:01:15.147
I'm so sorry. Very rude of me.

798
01:01:15.275 --> 01:01:18.310
Um, ham and piccalilli?
It's delicious.


799
01:01:18.376 --> 01:01:20.786
- I don't want your sandwich.
- No?


800
01:01:21.043 --> 01:01:23.543
Oh, then, really,
you must have a pickled egg.


801
01:01:23.609 --> 01:01:25.951
You can gather your things together
and get out.


802
01:01:26.809 --> 01:01:28.014
Right.

803
01:01:34.442 --> 01:01:35.681
Leave the book!

804
01:01:37.643 --> 01:01:40.849
Don't think I can't see what's
going on between you two.


805
01:01:40.909 --> 01:01:42.181
It's disgusting.

806
01:01:42.342 --> 01:01:44.908
Oh, by the way, thank you so much
for those Imparna recommendations.


807
01:01:44.909 --> 01:01:47.246
Really, inspiring stuff.
Especially the bird...


808
01:01:47.248 --> 01:01:48.319
Get out! Get out!

809
01:01:56.776 --> 01:01:58.879
Psst. Bella. Hello.

810
01:01:58.943 --> 01:02:00.922
Just wanted to say
I'm sorry if I've


811
01:02:00.924 --> 01:02:03.115
caused you trouble
with the old windbag.


812
01:02:03.175 --> 01:02:05.380
It's a pity you got chucked out
when you did.


813
01:02:06.209 --> 01:02:08.830
I'd found some fantastic
Viking drawings


814
01:02:08.832 --> 01:02:11.450
which I thought would
be great for Luna.


815
01:02:11.509 --> 01:02:13.111
Well, you could always show me now.

816
01:02:14.476 --> 01:02:17.044
No, I...

817
01:02:18.476 --> 01:02:22.284
I... No, I couldn't...
I couldn't possibly...


818
01:02:22.342 --> 01:02:25.616
Fraternizing with the enemy is
bad enough, but I... No, I...


819
01:02:31.643 --> 01:02:34.484
Mmm-hmm. Pink wafers?

820
01:02:35.975 --> 01:02:38.317
They're Miss Bramble's biscuits.

821
01:02:38.509 --> 01:02:41.180
Mmm. Delicious.

822
01:02:43.209 --> 01:02:45.744
So, what happens to Luna?

823
01:02:55.676 --> 01:03:00.416
Mesmerized, Luna couldn't help
but think about the peony.


824
01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:03.352
Luna asked the traveler where
he'd got the beautiful flower.


825
01:03:03.975 --> 01:03:06.317
"There are many,"
the traveler said.


826
01:03:07.509 --> 01:03:11.920
"From the top of the mountain,
you can see thousands.


827
01:03:13.809 --> 01:03:15.684
"A sea of petals.

828
01:03:16.809 --> 01:03:21.913
"It will make your heart sing,
for it's a beautiful sight."


829
01:03:24.275 --> 01:03:26.310
"But how will I get to the top
of the mountain?


830
01:03:27.042 --> 01:03:30.418
"I can't fly, and I only
come out at night."


831
01:03:31.476 --> 01:03:33.750
But the traveler had
heard this before.


832
01:03:34.042 --> 01:03:36.656
"You seek the rarest
flower from the top


833
01:03:36.658 --> 01:03:39.078
of the tallest
mountain in the world.


834
01:03:40.142 --> 01:03:45.984
"If you want to see
them enough, you will."


835
01:03:46.609 --> 01:03:51.576
Luna was scared and excited
in equal measure.


836
01:03:53.942 --> 01:03:56.853
"I think I will find
my mother and father there."


837
01:03:58.776 --> 01:04:02.345
The traveler smiled.
"You have much to learn, child.


838
01:04:02.776 --> 01:04:06.652
"Are you sure you want to continue
on this perilous quest?"


839
01:04:11.942 --> 01:04:13.284
Keep going.

840
01:04:15.875 --> 01:04:17.581
I don't know what happens next.

841
01:04:18.342 --> 01:04:20.320
But I want to know the ending.

842
01:04:29.676 --> 01:04:31.415
Will you have tea with me tomorrow?

843
01:04:32.542 --> 01:04:33.542
After work.

844
01:04:34.409 --> 01:04:36.409
Yes, please.

845
01:04:37.609 --> 01:04:39.314
That would be lovely.

846
01:04:50.609 --> 01:04:52.553
Well, until tomorrow, Bella Brown.

847
01:04:53.643 --> 01:04:57.086
<i>Under the old cedar
tree in the park. 6:00.</i>


848
01:05:10.942 --> 01:05:12.215
Bella.

849
01:05:13.009 --> 01:05:14.715
Bella, wake up.

850
01:05:16.842 --> 01:05:18.013
Billy.

851
01:05:19.075 --> 01:05:22.451
It's not Billy, it's...
It's Vernon.


852
01:05:26.743 --> 01:05:28.687
Come on.

853
01:05:28.975 --> 01:05:30.180
Oh.

854
01:05:31.908 --> 01:05:34.386
I have work at 9:00.

855
01:05:38.808 --> 01:05:41.377
Billy's his name, yeah?

856
01:05:42.009 --> 01:05:43.884
He's wonderful, Vernon.

857
01:05:43.975 --> 01:05:45.317
I'm seeing him again tonight.

858
01:05:47.743 --> 01:05:49.345
What does Mr. Wonderful do?

859
01:05:49.409 --> 01:05:54.752
He invents mechanical animals, and
he makes me feel like I can fly.


860
01:05:55.376 --> 01:05:57.149
So, he's got prospects then?

861
01:05:57.609 --> 01:05:59.245
See you later!

862
01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:28.643
What?

863
01:06:31.376 --> 01:06:32.718
You're fired.

864
01:06:36.775 --> 01:06:39.014
<i>But Luna knew
that whatever obstacles</i>


865
01:06:39.075 --> 01:06:42.780
<i>stood in her way, her
quest could not fail.</i>


866
01:06:44.142 --> 01:06:46.401
<i>She had been greatly
inspired by the</i>


867
01:06:46.403 --> 01:06:48.417
<i>words of the
wonderful traveler.</i>


868
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:51.109
<i>He would stand by her.</i>

869
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:44.877
Come on, Bella, what's wrong?

870
01:07:45.542 --> 01:07:47.247
I'm not feeling well.

871
01:08:01.242 --> 01:08:02.242
Ah, my son.

872
01:08:02.808 --> 01:08:04.808
How long since your
last confession?


873
01:08:05.808 --> 01:08:07.252
Bella's ill.

874
01:08:07.476 --> 01:08:08.782
What's wrong with her?

875
01:08:08.975 --> 01:08:10.112
I don't know.

876
01:08:10.975 --> 01:08:12.419
She should snap out of it.

877
01:08:13.942 --> 01:08:15.498
Right. Well, I'll
be sure to pass on


878
01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.012
your words of
sympathy and support.


879
01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:22.877
Come on, Bella, what's wrong?

880
01:08:25.042 --> 01:08:26.486
Bella.

881
01:08:28.342 --> 01:08:31.218
Come on, whatever's happened
with Mr. Mechanical Genius,


882
01:08:31.275 --> 01:08:33.980
you've got to get
this garden finished.


883
01:08:34.576 --> 01:08:36.746
O'Brien's going to
be here on Monday.


884
01:08:37.942 --> 01:08:38.942
Bella.

885
01:08:39.542 --> 01:08:41.963
Okay, Bella, I've got a
pain au chocolat here


886
01:08:41.965 --> 01:08:44.385
and I'm going to eat it
here without a plate.


887
01:08:45.442 --> 01:08:47.942
Yeah, there is no plate here.

888
01:08:49.275 --> 01:08:51.514
Okay, well, don't say
I didn't warn you.


889
01:08:52.442 --> 01:08:55.215
There's flakes going
all over the carpet here.


890
01:08:55.875 --> 01:08:57.682
Leave me alone please.

891
01:09:04.142 --> 01:09:05.313
How's the patient?

892
01:09:06.476 --> 01:09:07.851
Oh...

893
01:09:07.908 --> 01:09:10.011
Well, it's more than
medicine can fix.


894
01:09:10.642 --> 01:09:12.586
Unless you've got something
for a broken heart.


895
01:09:13.242 --> 01:09:16.685
I could have a word with her
if you think it might help.


896
01:09:18.042 --> 01:09:20.747
But gently does it, yeah?

897
01:09:20.808 --> 01:09:21.911
Yes, of course.

898
01:09:23.409 --> 01:09:25.318
Bella, open the bloody door.

899
01:09:26.842 --> 01:09:29.480
Don't make me ask you again.

900
01:09:41.309 --> 01:09:42.581
You look a mess.

901
01:09:42.642 --> 01:09:43.984
Alfie!

902
01:09:45.642 --> 01:09:47.586
Vernon, give us a
couple of minutes.


903
01:09:48.109 --> 01:09:49.882
Why don't you go and rustle up

904
01:09:49.942 --> 01:09:52.253
some of that nonexistent
black pudding


905
01:09:52.255 --> 01:09:54.388
that I saw in the
kitchen just now?


906
01:09:55.509 --> 01:09:56.850
Okay, then.

907
01:10:02.309 --> 01:10:04.378
I brought you a present.

908
01:10:15.942 --> 01:10:17.851
Ask me that personal question.

909
01:10:20.508 --> 01:10:21.850
Anything you like.

910
01:10:27.575 --> 01:10:29.575
Have you ever been in love?

911
01:10:34.608 --> 01:10:36.416
She was called Rose.

912
01:10:38.142 --> 01:10:40.017
She was a free spirit.

913
01:10:40.875 --> 01:10:43.285
She said I was a stuffed shirt.

914
01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:47.144
You fell in love?

915
01:10:47.275 --> 01:10:48.275
Yes.

916
01:10:49.642 --> 01:10:51.382
It took about 20 minutes.

917
01:10:52.541 --> 01:10:54.281
It took her a bit longer.

918
01:10:55.875 --> 01:10:57.217
You were happy together?

919
01:11:00.109 --> 01:11:03.780
As happy as two people
can be, I think.


920
01:11:06.242 --> 01:11:08.845
She well and truly
unstuffed the shirt.


921
01:11:10.808 --> 01:11:15.684
Then we traveled everywhere,
we shared everything.


922
01:11:16.842 --> 01:11:20.309
She was a horticulturalist,
the best.


923
01:11:23.842 --> 01:11:25.411
She wrote the book.

924
01:11:25.475 --> 01:11:26.919
Yeah, she did.

925
01:11:27.642 --> 01:11:30.130
She thought that "Arthur
Mildmay" sounded


926
01:11:30.132 --> 01:11:32.145
more credible than
"Rose Milton".


927
01:11:32.842 --> 01:11:37.547
In those days, it was impossible to
publish a female horticulturalist.


928
01:11:38.908 --> 01:11:43.852
But she was a... She
was a bright spark.


929
01:11:43.908 --> 01:11:48.011
And if she believed in something,
she gave it all she had.


930
01:11:50.275 --> 01:11:53.514
She taught me how to live.

931
01:11:56.808 --> 01:12:02.378
And then, she died all of a sudden
in childbirth.


932
01:12:05.009 --> 01:12:06.884
Well, it was many years ago.

933
01:12:08.775 --> 01:12:11.276
No warning, just...

934
01:12:12.009 --> 01:12:14.452
Just gone, both of them.

935
01:12:17.309 --> 01:12:20.411
But the garden, it's,
uh, helped me to cope.


936
01:12:23.842 --> 01:12:29.843
Rose had a passion for life,
and I see the seeds of that in you.


937
01:12:31.408 --> 01:12:36.876
And it upsets me greatly to see you
lying here, withering on the vine.


938
01:12:37.708 --> 01:12:39.617
So, I say...

939
01:12:40.541 --> 01:12:43.484
I say, grasp the nettle,
you stupid girl,


940
01:12:43.486 --> 01:12:46.078
and stop feeling
sorry for yourself.


941
01:12:46.142 --> 01:12:48.086
You're right.

942
01:12:48.541 --> 01:12:49.917
I am stupid.

943
01:12:51.342 --> 01:12:54.683
Stupid enough to fall
for a liar and a cheat.


944
01:12:57.742 --> 01:13:00.243
And I thought he actually cared.

945
01:13:04.808 --> 01:13:06.115
Well...

946
01:13:15.242 --> 01:13:19.186
Did you know I represented my
country at clay pigeon shooting?


947
01:13:19.508 --> 01:13:21.884
No.

948
01:13:23.242 --> 01:13:27.845
Well, this boy you're talking
about, this robot-builder...


949
01:13:28.875 --> 01:13:31.751
I think I may have to shoot him.

950
01:13:42.975 --> 01:13:46.441
<i>Then one night, alone
in the forest,</i>


951
01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:51.712
<i>Luna resolved to find
the magic flowers herself,</i>


952
01:13:52.341 --> 01:13:55.615
<i>even if it meant
confronting terrifying demons.</i>


953
01:13:56.475 --> 01:13:59.385
<i>She had nothing left to lose.</i>

954
01:14:21.408 --> 01:14:22.818
Oh, God.

955
01:14:23.408 --> 01:14:25.613
What the hell is she doing?

956
01:14:50.508 --> 01:14:52.452
Everything else is wrecked.

957
01:14:55.042 --> 01:14:56.986
We'll never fix it in time.

958
01:15:04.241 --> 01:15:08.310
I don't care about your hay fever,
we've got work to do.


959
01:15:08.842 --> 01:15:11.911
Here she comes.

960
01:15:12.142 --> 01:15:14.074
You know, I told you that
in some parts of the world,


961
01:15:14.075 --> 01:15:16.279
they celebrate when it rains.

962
01:15:16.341 --> 01:15:18.729
Well, we think it
would be healthy if


963
01:15:18.731 --> 01:15:21.117
we celebrated this
little storm, too.


964
01:15:22.508 --> 01:15:23.713
"Celebrate"?

965
01:15:24.308 --> 01:15:26.343
The garden's ruined, I'm ruined.

966
01:15:26.541 --> 01:15:28.746
No, it's been the
making of you, Bella.


967
01:15:28.808 --> 01:15:30.649
Trees blew down, 
Hedges blew down,

968
01:15:30.708 --> 01:15:33.709
but you saved the one thing
that needed to be saved.


969
01:15:34.241 --> 01:15:37.276
Anyway, enough of this.
We think you should have a day off.


970
01:15:37.675 --> 01:15:39.311
Yeah, our treat.

971
01:15:41.142 --> 01:15:42.380
I'm not exactly in the mood.

972
01:15:42.441 --> 01:15:44.715
Oh, come on, have the day to
yourself, cheer yourself up.


973
01:15:45.341 --> 01:15:46.614
So, off you go.

974
01:15:47.708 --> 01:15:48.947
You're both mad.

975
01:15:49.009 --> 01:15:50.714
People in glass houses, Bella.

976
01:15:50.875 --> 01:15:54.284
Well, that's settled then. So, off
you go. Milly will go with you.


977
01:15:54.675 --> 01:15:56.778

Hello, Bella.

- Hi, Bella.


988
01:16:43.408 --> 01:16:46.477
We've been working all day
to get the pond ready for the fish.


989
01:16:46.541 --> 01:16:47.814
It looks wonderful.

and some for you if you want.

993
01:16:55.742 --> 01:16:56.192
Oh. Yay.

994
01:16:56.193 --> 01:16:57.540
All right, now,
just feed the fish.

01:16:57.541 --> 01:17:00.144
And make sure
they don't bite your hands off.


996

Lovely!

998
01:17:11.009 --> 01:17:12.418
- Has she been drinking?
- Yes.


999
01:17:13.009 --> 01:17:14.816
- Be nice to her.
- Of course.


1000
01:17:15.108 --> 01:17:16.108
Okay.

1001
01:17:16.174 --> 01:17:18.152
All right, come on,

1002

1003
01:17:19.975 --> 01:17:20.975
Oh, please.

1004
01:17:21.042 --> 01:17:23.610
- Oh! There we go.
- Okay. White.

Brown, is all mine.

01:17:54.842 --> 01:17:56.513
No, I only lent it to you.

1011
01:17:56.908 --> 01:17:59.181
When I'm pushing up the daisies,
then you can have it.

We're about to find
out, Miss Brown.


1024
01:18:51.508 --> 01:18:53.110
Excuse me.

1025
01:18:57.174 --> 01:18:59.379
Gideon O'Brien, the landlord.

1026
01:19:00.274 --> 01:19:03.445
Miss Brown is popular
with the male of the species.


1027
01:19:04.808 --> 01:19:05.842
Bella!

1028
01:19:11.842 --> 01:19:14.978
Ah, Mr. O'Brien, welcome.
Come on through.


1029
01:19:16.108 --> 01:19:18.484
Vernon Kelly, the
tenant's boyfriend.


1030
01:19:19.174 --> 01:19:20.174
What?

1031
01:19:20.441 --> 01:19:21.612
Bella?

1032
01:19:21.742 --> 01:19:24.652
I'm impressed,
and I'm not ashamed to admit it.


1033
01:19:24.708 --> 01:19:26.407
Obviously, I received
no written request


1034
01:19:26.409 --> 01:19:27.982
for the insertion
of a water feature,


1035
01:19:28.041 --> 01:19:29.314
and the keeping of livestock.

1036
01:19:29.708 --> 01:19:30.807
But I'm prepared to overlook it

1037
01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:33.149
given the professional nature
of the work undertaken.


1038
01:19:33.208 --> 01:19:34.649
Okay, great.
Well, that does it then.


1039
01:19:34.708 --> 01:19:37.709
So, that only leaves one matter
outstanding, the rent increase.


1040
01:19:37.775 --> 01:19:39.340
What are you talking about,
what rent increase?


1041
01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:41.702
If she wants to stay, she'll
have to pay an increased figure


1042
01:19:41.708 --> 01:19:43.501
in line with the
new market value,


1043
01:19:43.503 --> 01:19:45.551
Section 23 of the
contract, watertight.


1044
01:19:46.308 --> 01:19:49.309
That's why our legal system
is revered the world over.


1045
01:19:49.375 --> 01:19:51.173
I can forward you the necessary
paperwork if you'd like.


1046
01:19:51.174 --> 01:19:52.841
This is her home now.
She's done all of this work,


1047
01:19:52.842 --> 01:19:54.046
you can't just do that.

1048
01:19:54.108 --> 01:19:55.745
Allow me to talk to Mr. O'Brien.

1049
01:19:55.808 --> 01:19:57.944
- What are you doing here?
- Come on.


1050
01:20:03.408 --> 01:20:04.750
All right?

1051
01:20:06.708 --> 01:20:08.344
He won't be bothering Bella again.

1052
01:20:09.341 --> 01:20:11.285
Why, what did you say to him?

1053
01:20:12.074 --> 01:20:13.347
Who are you?

1054
01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:16.413
I'm Billy, I'm looking for Bella.

1055
01:20:16.475 --> 01:20:18.544
She's not expecting me,
I'm a few days late.


1056
01:20:19.341 --> 01:20:20.478
Hmm.

1057
01:20:21.974 --> 01:20:23.681
Married? Well, of
course I'm not


1058
01:20:23.683 --> 01:20:25.647
married. But why
does she think that?


1059
01:20:25.941 --> 01:20:28.283
She saw you all over some woman.

1060
01:20:28.341 --> 01:20:30.376
Yes, you stood her up, you weasel.

1061
01:20:30.608 --> 01:20:34.949
No, I told you I had an accident,
that's why I couldn't be there.


1062
01:20:35.008 --> 01:20:37.612
I've been in hospital and I...

1063
01:20:37.974 --> 01:20:40.452
- I couldn't get her number.
- You got her address.


1064
01:20:40.508 --> 01:20:43.577
I got it this morning from the...

1065
01:20:44.941 --> 01:20:46.976
From the Adopt A Duck Society.

1066
01:20:51.108 --> 01:20:52.949
"The Adopt A Duck Society."

1067
01:20:53.341 --> 01:20:55.580
Look, I didn't know
she had a boyfriend, all right?


1068
01:20:57.108 --> 01:20:58.552
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

1069
01:20:58.941 --> 01:21:00.180
Why didn't you call her?

1070
01:21:00.974 --> 01:21:04.111
- He's already answered that.
- Yeah, I know that.


1071
01:21:04.174 --> 01:21:07.913
I'm trying to test him out,
see if he changes his answer.


1072
01:21:10.842 --> 01:21:12.820
What are your intentions
towards Bella?


1073
01:21:13.141 --> 01:21:14.642
I like her very much.

1074
01:21:15.008 --> 01:21:17.273
All right, now, I appreciate
that you two are close family,


1075
01:21:17.274 --> 01:21:19.395
but, really, I think I'd rather
tell Bella to her face


1076
01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:21.680
before you two interrogate
me any further.


1077
01:21:22.675 --> 01:21:23.879
William Tranter.

1078
01:21:24.841 --> 01:21:27.115
You have embarrassed
and humiliated me.


1079
01:21:27.808 --> 01:21:29.376
Now leave

1080
01:21:29.508 --> 01:21:31.452
before I let Vernon loose on you.

1081
01:21:35.108 --> 01:21:36.245
Bella...

1082
01:21:37.808 --> 01:21:40.251
Bella, we've had a
word with young Billy.


1083
01:21:40.675 --> 01:21:44.948
He says he isn't married, and for
what it's worth, I believe him.


1084
01:21:45.008 --> 01:21:48.350
I saw him with someone else
the day we were supposed to meet.


1085
01:21:48.907 --> 01:21:52.750
But, Bella, I was hit
by a bus that day.


1086
01:21:52.808 --> 01:21:54.012
That's why I wasn't there.

1087
01:21:54.074 --> 01:21:55.813
I know what I saw.

1088
01:21:57.375 --> 01:21:59.909
Oh, that must have been George.

1089
01:21:59.974 --> 01:22:02.714
I know your face, Billy.
It wasn't your brother, it was you.


1090
01:22:02.775 --> 01:22:06.480
No, he's only seven minutes
younger, Bella, we're identical.


1091
01:22:06.541 --> 01:22:09.747
- You're a twin?
- Triplet, actually.


1092
01:22:09.807 --> 01:22:13.342
Yes, and each of us all separated
by a whole seven minutes.


1093
01:22:13.408 --> 01:22:16.147
Actually, quite the ladies' man,
young George.


1094
01:22:16.208 --> 01:22:17.277
Oh.

1095
01:22:20.642 --> 01:22:23.279
You know, I would never
lie to you, Bella.


1096
01:22:23.708 --> 01:22:24.708
I...

1097
01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:28.210
Well, actually, I've
just been telling your


1098
01:22:28.212 --> 01:22:30.014
father and your
grandfather here that...


1099
01:22:30.074 --> 01:22:31.983
- I'm not her father!
- "Grandfather"?


1100
01:22:33.341 --> 01:22:34.841
You must believe me, Bella.

1101
01:22:36.642 --> 01:22:39.051
I've got a couple of friends
playing in the park tonight.


1102
01:22:39.108 --> 01:22:43.075
I was rather hoping
that you might be my guest.


1103
01:22:44.608 --> 01:22:45.846
Bella?

1104
01:22:47.074 --> 01:22:48.211
Bella?

1105
01:22:48.907 --> 01:22:50.249
Bella, are you there?

1106
01:22:52.475 --> 01:22:53.612
I'm here.

1107
01:22:55.675 --> 01:22:57.414
You're a bit accident prone.

1108
01:22:58.074 --> 01:23:00.382
I do seem to be around you.

1109
01:23:03.208 --> 01:23:04.709
So, the concert?

1110
01:23:08.907 --> 01:23:10.816
I'll come and get you
at half past 6:00.


1111
01:23:11.108 --> 01:23:13.586
And I'll be sure not to hit
any buses on the way.


1112
01:23:17.642 --> 01:23:18.846
Promise.

1113
01:23:52.208 --> 01:23:53.208
Perfect.

1114
01:23:53.475 --> 01:23:55.884
I love it, it's brilliant.

1115
01:23:56.841 --> 01:23:58.819
But why didn't you show me before?

1116
01:24:04.841 --> 01:24:05.875
Hello?

1117
01:24:08.675 --> 01:24:11.312
Right, yes, of course.

1118
01:24:15.874 --> 01:24:17.011
Hello?

1119
01:25:00.575 --> 01:25:02.052
Come on, girls.

1120
01:25:11.108 --> 01:25:12.710
<i>My dear Bella,</i>

1121
01:25:12.807 --> 01:25:15.944
<i>as per my somewhat
pedantic instructions,</i>


1122
01:25:16.008 --> 01:25:18.952
<i>I assume that you are
all in your garden,</i>


1123
01:25:19.008 --> 01:25:21.679
<i>which I hope is looking
as good as I expect.</i>


1124
01:25:22.575 --> 01:25:27.019
<i>Vernon should be planting
a rather splendid Japanese maple.</i>


1125
01:25:27.074 --> 01:25:29.808
<i>Make sure that he
packs the earth down</i>


1126
01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:32.543
<i>and gives it a proper
drink regularly.</i>


1127
01:25:33.241 --> 01:25:37.014
<i>The reason for planting the tree
is, I admit, a selfish one.</i>


1128
01:25:40.041 --> 01:25:43.019
<i>I quite like the idea of you
telling your progeny</i>


1129
01:25:43.074 --> 01:25:47.519
<i>of this objectionable old fool who
used to potter around the garden.</i>


1130
01:25:49.408 --> 01:25:51.578
<i>So, it is planted for you,</i>

1131
01:25:51.641 --> 01:25:53.838
<i>and future generations of</i>

1132
01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:57.178
<i>spectacularly
dysfunctional artists.</i>


1133
01:26:00.475 --> 01:26:04.248
<i>The boring details are, as ever,
in the hands of solicitors,</i>


1134
01:26:05.308 --> 01:26:09.514
<i>but the bare fact is that
my home is now Vernon's.</i>


1135
01:26:10.375 --> 01:26:14.342
<i>He and the girls need the space
far more than I ever did.</i>


1136
01:26:15.108 --> 01:26:17.143
<i>You 'll be able to keep an eye
an the daft bugger</i>


1137
01:26:17.208 --> 01:26:19.742
<i>because I'm giving you your flat.</i>

1138
01:26:19.807 --> 01:26:21.149
<i>I owned it.</i>

1139
01:26:21.807 --> 01:26:25.876
<i>The unfortunate Mr. O'Brien
was merely acting on my behalf.</i>


1140
01:26:28.907 --> 01:26:33.147
<i>Or should I say, on
behalf of the old Alfie.</i>


1141
01:26:35.241 --> 01:26:37.048
<i>You were a wonderful pupil,</i>

1142
01:26:38.074 --> 01:26:40.348
<i>and a dearly treasured friend.</i>

1143
01:26:41.807 --> 01:26:44.183
<i>You helped me remember
the good things.</i>


1144
01:26:45.141 --> 01:26:48.347
<i>Yours sincerely, 
Alfred Stevenson.</i>

1145
01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:11.540
<i>"And as Luna drank in the view,</i>

1146
01:27:12.041 --> 01:27:15.383
"she was filled with
something quite magical.


1147
01:27:15.441 --> 01:27:19.748
"In the distance, she could see the
southern shore of the Caspian Sea,


1148
01:27:19.807 --> 01:27:22.861
"which isn't a sea at
all, but, actually,


1149
01:27:22.863 --> 01:27:25.116
the biggest lake
in the world.


1150
01:27:25.174 --> 01:27:27.049
"Luna thanked the traveler.

1151
01:27:27.108 --> 01:27:31.211
<i>"'Oh, it's nothing. You haven't
done the hard part yet.'</i>


1152
01:27:31.874 --> 01:27:33.818
<i>'"Really?"' said Luna.</i>

1153
01:27:33.874 --> 01:27:37.511
<i>"Now, you must believe,"
said the traveler,</i>


1154
01:27:37.574 --> 01:27:39.950
<i>"and he pushed Luna
off the mountain.</i>


1155
01:27:40.008 --> 01:27:44.474
<i>"Luna screamed to the traveler,
'Why did you do that? I can't fly.'</i>


1156
01:27:45.108 --> 01:27:47.347
<i>"Says who?' he replied.</i>

1157
01:27:48.308 --> 01:27:53.048
<i>"And the wind lifted Luna off
the mountain and she soared.</i>


1158
01:27:53.707 --> 01:27:56.311
<i>“Can you see them now?'
yelled the traveler.</i>


1159
01:27:56.907 --> 01:27:59.078
<i>"Yes," said Luna,</i>

1160
01:27:59.141 --> 01:28:02.983
<i>"gliding through the air with the
wind whistling between her wings.</i>


1161
01:28:03.474 --> 01:28:06.043
<i>"'I can see thousands of them.'</i>

1162
01:28:07.507 --> 01:28:10.576
<i>"And for the first time
in a hundred years,</i>


1163
01:28:11.141 --> 01:28:14.607
<i>"the traveler allowed
him self a smile."</i>
