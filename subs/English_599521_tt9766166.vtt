1
00:00:02.099 --> 00:00:03.319
Zed: Welcome back
to Seabrook,


2
00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:05.281
where belonging is everything.

3
00:00:07.234 --> 00:00:09.114
Addison:
We're a strong, united


4
00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:10.889
and tight-knit community.

5
00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:15.593
And that's a good thing 'cause
it wasn't always this way.


6
00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:19.156
There was a time when
we had to protect ourselves.


7
00:00:21.553 --> 00:00:24.603
Legend has it that when the
first settlers came to Seabrook,


8
00:00:24.643 --> 00:00:27.043
they found wild beasts
with sharp claws


9
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.340
lurking in the forest.

10
00:00:28.386 --> 00:00:29.686
(snarling)

11
00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:31.775
Zed: Which sparked
an epic battle.


12
00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:35.184
Seabrook settlers bravely
fought off the monstrous attack.


13
00:00:37.047 --> 00:00:39.397
And discovered a powerful
energy source.


14
00:00:40.876 --> 00:00:43.526
Realizing they discovered
a precious resource,


15
00:00:43.575 --> 00:00:45.265
they safeguarded it
from the beasts.


16
00:00:47.318 --> 00:00:48.878
Addison: They weren't going to
let anyone steal their treasure.


17
00:00:48.928 --> 00:00:50.228
So they hid it.

18
00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:53.055
And the town prospered
and grew rich


19
00:00:53.106 --> 00:00:55.796
by harnessing the precious
energy source.


20
00:00:55.848 --> 00:00:58.548
Seabrook benefited greatly
as it grew strong,


21
00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.980
happy, and unified.

22
00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.806
Zed: The beasts were
a distant memory.


23
00:01:01.854 --> 00:01:03.994
Addison: Seabrook forgot
monsters could be real.


24
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.900
Zed: Until clearly,
they were.


25
00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:07.895
A little lime soda mixed
with a dash


26
00:01:07.947 --> 00:01:09.987
of industrial strength
Seabrook energy...


27
00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:12.946
- And boom!
- (explosion)


28
00:01:12.995 --> 00:01:14.205
Zombies were created.

29
00:01:14.258 --> 00:01:16.558
(growling and snarling)

30
00:01:20.873 --> 00:01:23.533
In a lot of ways,
Seabrook's moved on since then.


31
00:01:24.703 --> 00:01:26.753
But it's hard to bury
your past.


32
00:01:30.012 --> 00:01:31.882
(growling)

33
00:01:31.927 --> 00:01:33.537
(terrified screaming)

34
00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:35.111
(growling)

35
00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:39.892
Kids:
Let's go, let's go, let's go!


36
00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:41.145
(playful growling)

37
00:01:41.198 --> 00:01:43.108
Hey, I'm Zed.

38
00:01:43.156 --> 00:01:45.156
And yup, still a zombie.

39
00:01:45.202 --> 00:01:46.382
(grunts)

40
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.290
For zombies in Seabrook,
things are changing.


41
00:01:48.335 --> 00:01:50.285
Every day is better
than the last.


42
00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:54.862
Seabrook is getting rid of all
of its old anti-monster laws,


43
00:01:54.907 --> 00:01:57.167
so now Zombietown is open
to everyone.


44
00:01:57.214 --> 00:01:58.434
Come on!

45
00:01:58.476 --> 00:02:00.826
Wait, wait, wait!
No, Zoey, wait for me!


46
00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.039
Wait. Watch out!

47
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.140
And business is booming.

48
00:02:05.874 --> 00:02:06.924
Hey, hey!

49
00:02:06.962 --> 00:02:08.272
What's up, coach?

50
00:02:08.312 --> 00:02:11.362
Oh, football off-season
has been good to me, Zed.


51
00:02:11.402 --> 00:02:13.102
Invested in a Fro
-Yo cart.

52
00:02:13.143 --> 00:02:15.883
Little side hustle,
gonna go global,


53
00:02:15.928 --> 00:02:18.058
gonna buy a car,
get some dress shirts,


54
00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:20.194
go on vacation
without my great aunt Edna.


55
00:02:20.237 --> 00:02:21.887
Though she loves
swimwear weather.


56
00:02:21.934 --> 00:02:23.374
You know I might just
bring her along.


57
00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:25.854
Cauliflower brains
mocha crunch, please.


58
00:02:25.894 --> 00:02:27.034
You got it!

59
00:02:28.506 --> 00:02:29.936
Seabrook has way more flavors
than just vanilla now.


60
00:02:29.985 --> 00:02:31.465
I'll take a vanilla, coach.

61
00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:33.119
What? I like vanilla.

62
00:02:33.163 --> 00:02:34.383
In a couple days,

63
00:02:34.425 --> 00:02:36.035
we're even tearing down
old Seabrook power


64
00:02:36.078 --> 00:02:37.728
to build a new cheer pavilion.

65
00:02:37.776 --> 00:02:40.166
And not to take too much credit
for all the positive changes,


66
00:02:40.213 --> 00:02:41.523
but yeah, I did good.

67
00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:43.092
It's hard to believe
there was a time


68
00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:44.739
when people were afraid
of zombies.


69
00:02:49.527 --> 00:02:51.177
Okay, let's triple check that.

70
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.530
Hey, Dad.

71
00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:54.624
Hey, son.

72
00:02:54.662 --> 00:02:56.752
First day as foreman
of the demo crew.


73
00:02:56.795 --> 00:02:59.005
- Big day for zombie-kind.
- Yeah, you'll do great.


74
00:02:59.058 --> 00:03:01.018
Just don't make any lame
zombie dad jokes.


75
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.980
But the workin' stiffs love 'em.

76
00:03:03.018 --> 00:03:04.018
(laughs)

77
00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:09.761
(cheering)

78
00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:14.861
Boy: Go, Shrimpy! Go Shrimpy!

79
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.380
Cheer Camp!

80
00:03:16.423 --> 00:03:18.343
Even more sparkly
than I dreamed.


81
00:03:18.382 --> 00:03:19.472
(laughs)

82
00:03:19.513 --> 00:03:22.123
Hi, I'm Addison, and this
is cheer camp,


83
00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:23.948
a place where everyone belongs.

84
00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:25.076
We're a unified squad and...

85
00:03:25.127 --> 00:03:26.687
Bucky: Split up.

86
00:03:26.738 --> 00:03:28.958
Usually unified.
(chuckles)


87
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:31.441
(whistle blows)

88
00:03:31.482 --> 00:03:33.752
♪♪

89
00:03:33.788 --> 00:03:35.918
- Woo!
- All: Yay, Bucky!


90
00:03:35.964 --> 00:03:38.884
That's cheer captain Bucky,
my cousin.


91
00:03:38.924 --> 00:03:40.454
(applause)

92
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.190
You've all heard the stories
of bloodthirsty monsters


93
00:03:44.234 --> 00:03:45.804
- who roam these woods,
- (Shrimpy whimpering)


94
00:03:45.844 --> 00:03:48.064
feasting on innocent
cheerleaders.


95
00:03:48.107 --> 00:03:49.367
- Boo!
- (screams)


96
00:03:50.065 --> 00:03:52.545
(Bucky laughs)

97
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.900
Well, those stories are just
silly make believe.


98
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.030
But you'd better believe
we're gonna break you down


99
00:03:57.072 --> 00:04:01.082
and build you back up into peppy
little cheer machines like...


100
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.820
- Lacey!
- (applause)


101
00:04:04.863 --> 00:04:07.003
- Stacey!
- (applause)


102
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.000
And our most recent Acey,
JC.


103
00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.129
(applause)

104
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.350
I'm Kevin.

105
00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.009
...Right.

106
00:04:20.357 --> 00:04:23.137
We changed my name to JC,
which I love by the way.


107
00:04:25.666 --> 00:04:27.536
Long live the Aceys!

108
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:28.801
(applause)

109
00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:31.929
You three lead the veterans,
you're the A-team.


110
00:04:31.977 --> 00:04:34.847
Addison, Bree, you take
the newbies.


111
00:04:34.893 --> 00:04:37.203
You're the, uh, you're
the Z-team.


112
00:04:39.027 --> 00:04:41.247
(yelling)
Hey, hey! Ho, ho!


113
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:43.341
This demolition
has got to go!


114
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.860
They can't tear it down, Zed.

115
00:04:44.903 --> 00:04:46.563
Seabrook power hasn't worked
for years.


116
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.340
It's an important part of
zombie heritage.


117
00:04:48.385 --> 00:04:50.075
This is progress, Eliza.

118
00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:51.995
And now we can even
go to Prawn.


119
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.310
Prawn is like super-sized prom,
but Mighty Shrimp themed.


120
00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.439
And, this is the first year
zombies can attend.


121
00:04:58.482 --> 00:05:00.962
And it's gonna be epic.

122
00:05:01.006 --> 00:05:03.566
I'm loud and proud to be
a zombie.


123
00:05:03.617 --> 00:05:04.967
Sometimes too loud.

124
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.710
Soon, Z-band tech will get
so good


125
00:05:07.752 --> 00:05:09.362
that zombies will blend
right in.


126
00:05:09.406 --> 00:05:11.016
I dream of a day we ditch
our Z-bands


127
00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:12.539
and let our
inner monsters roar.


128
00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:14.243
(roars)

129
00:05:15.412 --> 00:05:18.202
Zombies, this is obviously
your first cheer camp.


130
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.630
Now, I'm not anti-change,

131
00:05:19.677 --> 00:05:21.937
I'm just pro keeping things
the way they are,


132
00:05:21.983 --> 00:05:24.813
because you don't mess
with success.


133
00:05:24.856 --> 00:05:26.286
(laughs)

134
00:05:26.336 --> 00:05:28.206
This week, the veterans
and the newbies will compete


135
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.900
for the Cheer Camp Cup

136
00:05:29.948 --> 00:05:31.988
to see who is more
cheertastic!


137
00:05:32.037 --> 00:05:34.387
The veterans have always
won the Cheer Camp Cup,


138
00:05:34.431 --> 00:05:35.431
right Aceys?

139
00:05:35.475 --> 00:05:36.685
All: Right!

140
00:05:36.737 --> 00:05:37.957
We'll see about that.

141
00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:39.909
To the cheer course!

142
00:05:40.524 --> 00:05:42.184
Watch and learn, snowball.

143
00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:43.791
Ah yes, my hair.

144
00:05:43.831 --> 00:05:45.751
Still white,
still well-conditioned,


145
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.140
and still drawing fire
from the Aceys.


146
00:05:48.183 --> 00:05:50.363
Bucky: Addison,
get those pom-poms pumping.


147
00:05:50.403 --> 00:05:52.363
Let's show 'em that we got this.

148
00:05:52.405 --> 00:05:53.835
All: Yeah!

149
00:05:53.885 --> 00:05:55.925
- Let's go!
- Come on, Z-team!

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.840
Hi!

321
00:13:08.885 --> 00:13:10.965
- (groans)
- (screaming continues)


322
00:13:12.323 --> 00:13:14.593
(screaming continues)

323
00:13:15.892 --> 00:13:17.812
- (groans)
- Now!


324
00:13:22.986 --> 00:13:25.896
(screaming)

325
00:13:30.907 --> 00:13:32.777
(screaming)

326
00:13:36.347 --> 00:13:37.777
Bucky:
Is everybody okay?


327
00:13:39.437 --> 00:13:41.087
(screaming)

328
00:13:41.134 --> 00:13:43.184
Nothing can happen to me,
I'm way too important!


329
00:13:45.008 --> 00:13:46.968
Everyone, stay calm.

330
00:13:47.532 --> 00:13:48.972
Great leadership, Addie.

331
00:13:49.012 --> 00:13:50.842
Very future cheer captain
of you.


332
00:13:52.102 --> 00:13:53.232
Zed!

333
00:13:56.323 --> 00:13:57.933
(groans)

334
00:13:57.977 --> 00:13:58.887
(thud)

335
00:14:02.939 --> 00:14:04.679
(birds squawking)

336
00:14:08.031 --> 00:14:09.381
Ah!

337
00:14:11.861 --> 00:14:14.561
(distant whispering
and hissing sounds)


338
00:14:15.299 --> 00:14:16.429
Who's there?

339
00:14:17.257 --> 00:14:18.517
Zed?

340
00:14:20.086 --> 00:14:21.166
Who's there?

341
00:14:22.088 --> 00:14:23.308
Hello?

342
00:14:23.873 --> 00:14:25.483
Can anybody hear me?

343
00:14:25.962 --> 00:14:27.182
Zed?

344
00:14:27.877 --> 00:14:28.877
(gasps)

345
00:14:29.966 --> 00:14:31.446
(growling)

346
00:14:37.974 --> 00:14:41.284
(howling)

347
00:14:42.413 --> 00:14:44.243
(wolves howling)

348
00:14:47.897 --> 00:14:49.677
- (screams)
- (groans)


349
00:14:49.724 --> 00:14:50.944
Zed! (laughs)

350
00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:53.900
I missed you too.

351
00:14:54.251 --> 00:14:54.951
Boy:
There they are!


352
00:14:54.991 --> 00:14:56.121
Zoey.

353
00:14:56.166 --> 00:14:57.516
We're not alone.

354
00:14:57.558 --> 00:14:59.298
We're surrounded by...
werewolves.


355
00:14:59.343 --> 00:15:00.133
Cool!

356
00:15:00.953 --> 00:15:02.093
- What?
- Wolves?


357
00:15:02.128 --> 00:15:03.778
- What wolves?
- Here wolves?


358
00:15:03.825 --> 00:15:05.175
Aceys:
Were-wolves?


359
00:15:07.568 --> 00:15:08.868
Nobody's gonna believe this.

360
00:15:10.484 --> 00:15:11.834
Bucky:
Werewolves are real!


361
00:15:13.096 --> 00:15:16.836
I always, always said
the stories of monsters


362
00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:18.492
in the forest were real.

363
00:15:18.536 --> 00:15:19.886
And no one believed me.

364
00:15:21.495 --> 00:15:22.975
I thought werewolves
were just myths.


365
00:15:23.019 --> 00:15:24.239
Yeah, like cavities.

366
00:15:26.892 --> 00:15:27.942
Those are real too?

367
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.330
Werewolves, ew.

368
00:15:29.373 --> 00:15:31.903
I really hope my allergies
don't act up.


369
00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:33.771
Please can I have one?

370
00:15:33.812 --> 00:15:35.512
I'm the only zombie
in my class.


371
00:15:35.553 --> 00:15:37.253
A werewolf friend
would be great.


372
00:15:37.294 --> 00:15:39.514
I'll feed him and walk him.

373
00:15:39.557 --> 00:15:41.907
Yeah, werewolves
ain't class pets, Zoey.


374
00:15:41.951 --> 00:15:44.081
And they certainly
ain't friendly.


375
00:15:45.563 --> 00:15:47.303
I'm okay.

376
00:15:47.347 --> 00:15:49.477
Aunt Missy, Uncle Dale.

377
00:15:49.523 --> 00:15:53.483
The crash was horrible,
but I protected Addison.


378
00:15:53.527 --> 00:15:55.827
Anyone as courageous as me
would've done the same.


379
00:15:56.704 --> 00:15:58.884
Though not really,
I am super brave.


380
00:15:58.924 --> 00:16:01.014
Mom, Dad,
everything is fine.


381
00:16:01.057 --> 00:16:03.097
It's not fine. There are
werewolves circling us right now,


382
00:16:03.146 --> 00:16:04.316
waiting to attack.

383
00:16:04.364 --> 00:16:06.154
Yeah, and I'm way too tasty.

384
00:16:06.192 --> 00:16:08.372
I'm always looking like
a snack.


385
00:16:09.195 --> 00:16:10.455
Somebody has to do something.

386
00:16:10.501 --> 00:16:12.161
And someone will.

387
00:16:12.198 --> 00:16:13.808
Hold my purse.

388
00:16:15.462 --> 00:16:16.992
(gavel slams)

389
00:16:18.117 --> 00:16:20.157
By order of city council,
effective immediately,


390
00:16:20.206 --> 00:16:23.036
all anti-monster laws
are reinstated.


391
00:16:23.079 --> 00:16:23.949
(gavel slams)

392
00:16:23.993 --> 00:16:26.693
(cheering and applause)

393
00:16:27.692 --> 00:16:29.002
Mom, that is unfair!

394
00:16:33.045 --> 00:16:34.435
- Zed, we need to talk.
- We do.


395
00:16:36.048 --> 00:16:37.088
Even though you didn't write,
or answer any of my letters.


396
00:16:37.136 --> 00:16:38.086
No, I wrote.

397
00:16:38.137 --> 00:16:39.657
A lot.

398
00:16:40.835 --> 00:16:44.005
(sighs) The Aceys shredded
all of our letters.


399
00:16:45.884 --> 00:16:47.234
(chuckles)

400
00:16:52.412 --> 00:16:53.632
Addison.

401
00:16:53.674 --> 00:16:55.854
Will you make me
the luckiest zombie


402
00:16:56.373 --> 00:16:58.033
and be my date to Prawn?

403
00:16:58.679 --> 00:17:00.289
- No.
- Great! No?


404
00:17:00.333 --> 00:17:01.943
Everyone's freaking out
about werewolves,


405
00:17:01.987 --> 00:17:04.377
so the anti-monster laws are
in affect again, which means...


406
00:17:04.424 --> 00:17:05.864
Zombies can't go to Prawn.

407
00:17:05.904 --> 00:17:07.044
Ouch.

408
00:17:07.906 --> 00:17:09.466
But we're going to fight this,
Zed.


409
00:17:09.516 --> 00:17:10.946
Okay, so that's why
you said no?


410
00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:11.776
Yeah.

411
00:17:13.564 --> 00:17:14.874
Why are you smiling?

412
00:17:14.913 --> 00:17:16.393
Because when you said no,

413
00:17:16.436 --> 00:17:17.916
I thought you didn't
like me anymore.


414
00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:19.139
But the only problem here

415
00:17:19.178 --> 00:17:21.048
is a bunch of blood-thirsty
werewolves.


416
00:17:21.093 --> 00:17:22.663
We can so fix that.

417
00:17:24.096 --> 00:17:25.266
(laughs)

418
00:17:25.315 --> 00:17:26.925
Announcer:
Attention all citizens.


419
00:17:27.665 --> 00:17:29.795
Monster laws have
been reinstated.


420
00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:32.671
All curfews will be
strictly enforced.


421
00:17:32.713 --> 00:17:34.243
Attention all citizens.

422
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.850
Werewolves have been
sighted in the area.


423
00:17:36.891 --> 00:17:38.941
Take cover immediately.

424
00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:40.850
Keep children and pets inside.

425
00:17:40.895 --> 00:17:42.935
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
We're closed.


426
00:17:42.984 --> 00:17:44.074
For good.

427
00:17:44.899 --> 00:17:47.769
Dreams of Fro-Yo success
melted away.


428
00:17:48.468 --> 00:17:49.638
With monsters everywhere.

429
00:17:49.687 --> 00:17:52.857
Look, I like zombies.
They like Fro-Yo.


430
00:17:52.907 --> 00:17:55.817
But werewolves like human flesh.
Maybe with sprinkles.


431
00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:57.777
Everybody likes sprinkles.

432
00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:59.180
Just run.

433
00:17:59.218 --> 00:18:00.868
High knees, run!

434
00:18:00.915 --> 00:18:02.085

Announcer:
Attention all citizens.

00:18:08.619 --> 00:18:10.579
Keep children and pets inside.

439
00:18:10.621 --> 00:18:12.931
They see one werewolf,
and we can't go to Prawn?


440
00:18:12.971 --> 00:18:14.451
Okay, we have to fight this.

441
00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:15.504
Protest.

442
00:18:15.539 --> 00:18:17.109
Boycott.
Hunger strike!


443
00:18:18.542 --> 00:18:21.152
Fine. Finish your sandwich,
but this is so unfair.


444
00:18:22.285 --> 00:18:25.585
Announcer: Warning,
werewolves have been sighted in the area.


445
00:18:25.636 --> 00:18:28.546
- Take cover immediately.
- Zoey, come on home.


446
00:18:28.595 --> 00:18:31.725
It's not safe out here with
these werewolves on the loose.


447

Just one sec.

448
00:18:35.036 --> 00:18:37.776
Have you seen a werewolf?
I'm looking for a were-friend.


449
00:18:37.822 --> 00:18:39.822
Silly kid, there's no
such thing as werewolves.


450
00:18:39.867 --> 00:18:41.087
But we heard it howl.

451
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.180
Maybe it was a hiker saying,
"howl's it going?"


452
00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.610
It was a werewolf.

453
00:18:45.656 --> 00:18:47.826
My, what big eyes you have.

454
00:18:47.875 --> 00:18:49.005

What did you find out?

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:49.849
They saw you howling,

464
00:19:49.894 --> 00:19:50.764
So?

465
00:19:50.808 --> 00:19:51.938
We're exposed.

Stop being such a worry-wolf,

I only said "awoo"!

471
00:20:02.036 --> 00:20:04.256
It's like saying "ciao"
or "aloha."


472
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.040
Or "I'll rip your throat out."

It's a terrible town.

475

We have to find
the Great Alpha.


476
00:20:10.436 --> 00:20:12.046
If there even is
a Great Alpha.


477
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.010
Willa, we saw her
in the forest.


478
00:20:14.048 --> 00:20:16.268
- She had the white hair.
- It was probably just the light.


479
00:20:16.312 --> 00:20:17.702
She's real,

480
00:20:17.748 --> 00:20:20.048
and she's going to lead us
to the moonstone.


481
00:20:20.098 --> 00:20:21.968
And you know we don't have
much time.


482
00:20:22.013 --> 00:20:24.063
More and more of our pack
are getting sick.


483
00:20:24.102 --> 00:20:26.712
Our necklaces are almost
out of power.


484
00:20:26.757 --> 00:20:28.667
We need to find the moonstone.

485
00:20:28.715 --> 00:20:31.405
And when we do, we can
recharge our necklaces


486
00:20:31.457 --> 00:20:35.457
and stay wolf strong
for another 100 years.


487
00:20:35.505 --> 00:20:38.935
Okay. Even if the girl
is the Great Alpha,


488
00:20:38.986 --> 00:20:39.856
how do we find her?

489
00:20:40.988 --> 00:20:43.298
I found this in the woods.
It's hers.


490
00:20:43.339 --> 00:20:45.949
(gasps) We'll track her down
with our keen sense of smell.


491
00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.390
Says Seabrook High on it,

492
00:20:48.431 --> 00:20:49.951
so I thought we might
just look there.


493
00:20:49.997 --> 00:20:51.347
Ugh!

494
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:52.650
Okay, fine.

495
00:20:52.696 --> 00:20:54.826
We find the girl,
and if she's the Great Alpha,


496
00:20:54.872 --> 00:20:56.962
she'll tell us where
the moonstone is hidden.


497
00:20:57.004 --> 00:20:58.014
We go in the morning.

498
00:20:58.049 --> 00:20:59.439
We go tonight!

499
00:20:59.485 --> 00:21:00.785
Or tonight works.

find the girl,


563
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.730
get our moonstone and leave
this awful place.


564
00:23:36.773 --> 00:23:38.253
I wouldn't call it awful.

565
00:23:38.296 --> 00:23:40.296
They got something
called Fro-Yo.


566
00:23:41.908 --> 00:23:44.218
Yeah, you're right.
This town's the worst.


567
00:23:50.874 --> 00:23:52.274
Boy: Hey, I guess I
will see you after tryouts.


568
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.830
Girl:
Yeah, sure, awesome.


569
00:23:54.268 --> 00:23:55.618
Boy:
Hey, man, how are you...


570
00:23:58.098 --> 00:24:00.618
I really thought we'd all be
at the Prawn together.


571
00:24:00.666 --> 00:24:02.666
- I thought Seabrook could change.
- It did.


572
00:24:02.712 --> 00:24:04.762
Believe me, I will find a way
to get us to the Prawn.


573
00:24:04.801 --> 00:24:05.981
Or we could miss it together.

574
00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.500
I'm not letting you miss
the Prawn.


575
00:24:07.543 --> 00:24:09.333
If you can't go,
I'm not going.


576
00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:11.240
Well, I like you too much
not to let you go.


577
00:24:11.285 --> 00:24:13.065
Well, I like you too much
to leave you behind.


578
00:24:13.113 --> 00:24:14.333
I am so not going.

579
00:24:14.375 --> 00:24:16.675
Ugh, you guys even fight
like a perfect couple.


580
00:24:16.726 --> 00:24:18.076
How's it going, Eliza?

581
00:24:18.118 --> 00:24:19.898
You know, fighting injustice
is keeping me busy.


582
00:24:19.946 --> 00:24:21.816
And looking good doing it,
Zom-bae.


583
00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:22.861
(laughs)

584
00:24:22.906 --> 00:24:24.816
I'm thinking the student
president


585
00:24:24.864 --> 00:24:26.134
should get his own
corner office.


586
00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:27.520
Let's see if we can move out
the math department.


587
00:24:27.563 --> 00:24:28.873
- Write that down.
- Done.


588
00:24:28.912 --> 00:24:30.172
Addison!

589
00:24:30.217 --> 00:24:32.257
Time to officially nominate me
as president.


590
00:24:32.306 --> 00:24:36.006
Let's keep it understated,
yet extravagant and flashy.


591
00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:36.959
Ooh, yeah.

592
00:24:37.007 --> 00:24:38.007
Bucky:
Make sure...


593
00:24:38.051 --> 00:24:38.881
Cheer could be so much
more than


594
00:24:38.922 --> 00:24:40.752
just pom-pomming for Bucky.

595
00:24:40.793 --> 00:24:42.623
Lacey:
Uh, Addison?


596
00:24:43.274 --> 00:24:46.414
Once we're cheer captain,
you are so off the team.


597
00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:49.411
And when I'm cheer captain,
you'll be welcome to stay,


598
00:24:49.454 --> 00:24:51.984
because I'll be making cheer
about bringing people together.


599
00:24:52.022 --> 00:24:53.812
(laughs)
That was awful trash talk.


600
00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:55.160
I know, right?

601
00:24:55.199 --> 00:24:57.549
You will never be
cheer captain, freak.


602
00:24:57.593 --> 00:24:58.593
Stacey:
See ya.


603
00:25:00.596 --> 00:25:02.726
I gotta find a way to get us
to the Prawn.


604
00:25:02.772 --> 00:25:04.162
We can crash it.

605
00:25:04.208 --> 00:25:05.818
I mean, we can't make the rules,
but we can break 'em.


606
00:25:05.862 --> 00:25:06.822
(snaps fingers)

607
00:25:06.863 --> 00:25:08.263
Well, we can make the rules!

608
00:25:08.299 --> 00:25:10.079
We just need the right leader.

609
00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:15.000
- (cheering)
- Okay, are there any more nominees for president?


610
00:25:15.045 --> 00:25:17.605
Just a reminder that being part
of student council


611
00:25:17.656 --> 00:25:19.436
means that we get to hang.

612
00:25:19.876 --> 00:25:22.046
Anybody, anybody want
to hang?


613
00:25:22.095 --> 00:25:25.185
Just... anyone want
to hang out?


614
00:25:25.708 --> 00:25:27.358
Anyone?

615
00:25:27.405 --> 00:25:30.795
Oh, we could come up with our
very own complicated high five.


616
00:25:30.843 --> 00:25:31.893
That'd be fun, huh?

617
00:25:31.931 --> 00:25:33.241
Like...

618
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:34.930
Oooh...

619
00:25:34.978 --> 00:25:37.018
(band plays fanfare)

620
00:25:37.067 --> 00:25:41.377
Students: (chanting)
Go! Go! Go!


621
00:25:41.419 --> 00:25:43.029
(cheering)

622
00:25:43.421 --> 00:25:45.211
Hi!

623
00:25:45.249 --> 00:25:46.599
(cheering)

624
00:25:49.906 --> 00:25:52.386
(cheering and applause)

625
00:25:52.952 --> 00:25:54.212
Good job!

626
00:25:54.258 --> 00:25:55.688
Okay.

627
00:25:55.738 --> 00:25:57.438
(cheering)

628
00:25:58.567 --> 00:26:02.567
Great news, we have a brilliant
and cheer tested candidate


629
00:26:02.614 --> 00:26:04.144
running for president
this year.


630
00:26:04.181 --> 00:26:05.141
Me!

631
00:26:05.486 --> 00:26:06.966
(cheering)

632
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.710
(chanting)
Bucky! Bucky! Bucky!


633
00:26:08.751 --> 00:26:12.321
Students: Bucky!
Bucky! Bucky! Bucky!


634
00:26:12.363 --> 00:26:14.713
I'm running against Bucky
for president,


635
00:26:14.757 --> 00:26:16.717
but I need to one-up
his entrance.


636
00:26:16.759 --> 00:26:18.889
The question is, how?

637
00:26:18.935 --> 00:26:21.455
(chanting continues)

638
00:26:27.204 --> 00:26:28.554
(grunts)

639
00:26:28.771 --> 00:26:31.601
(grunting)

640
00:26:31.643 --> 00:26:34.043

Excuse me.

Zed:
Hello, everyone.


647
00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:44.830
My name is Zed, and I am running
for president.


648
00:26:45.178 --> 00:26:46.658
(cheering and laughing)

649
00:26:47.398 --> 00:26:48.878
Zed can't steal my spotlight.

650
00:26:48.921 --> 00:26:50.841
What about the whole
anti-monster thingy?


651
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.970
Shh...

652
00:26:52.011 --> 00:26:54.061
Anyone can run
for president, Bucky.


653
00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.020
She actually has a point,
Mr. Bucky.


654
00:26:56.059 --> 00:26:57.929
- (furiously) What?!
- Yes.


655
00:26:57.974 --> 00:26:59.324
A zombie president?

656
00:26:59.366 --> 00:27:00.926
Aceys: Ew!

00:27:00.977 --> 00:27:02.667
(cheering)

658
00:27:02.718 --> 00:27:04.328
As the first ever
zombie president,


659
00:27:04.371 --> 00:27:06.461
I will allow zombies to go
to the Prawn,


660
00:27:06.504 --> 00:27:08.074
I will take Addison
as my date,


661
00:27:08.114 --> 00:27:11.864
and we will get our photo
on the Prawn wall of fame.


662
00:27:11.901 --> 00:27:14.431
Maybe they'll rename the school
after me one day.


663
00:27:14.468 --> 00:27:16.118
Zed Necrodopolous High.

664
00:27:16.993 --> 00:27:18.913
Preferably before I graduate.

665
00:27:18.951 --> 00:27:20.041
Okay.

666

Yeah, silver.

676

677
00:27:45.761 --> 00:27:47.111
And rabies.

678
00:27:47.153 --> 00:27:48.723
Come on, if we're quiet,
we can be in and out of here


679

Ah, silver! Oh, pain!

No, I can't!

Nice grab.

As your president,


688
00:28:08.958 --> 00:28:12.438
I will make Seabrook a place
that embraces zombies and...


689
00:28:12.483 --> 00:28:13.403
(fearfully)
Werewolves?


690
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.440
Uh, no. Why would we want...

691
00:28:15.486 --> 00:28:16.746
(screams)
Werewolves!


692

Football team!
Defense, Z 24.


695

- Boy 1: Right!
- Boy 2: Let's go Mighty Shrimp!


696
00:28:28.717 --> 00:28:30.147
Where's the moonstone,
white hair?


697
00:28:30.196 --> 00:28:31.886
I think you've got
the wrong person.


698
00:28:31.937 --> 00:28:33.937
Uh, Eliza?
What are you doing?


699
00:28:33.983 --> 00:28:35.463
Let's smash our Z-bands
and zombie out.


700
00:28:35.506 --> 00:28:36.636
We can use our strength
to fend them off.


701
00:28:36.681 --> 00:28:38.341
We can't lose control.
We are not monsters.


702
00:28:38.683 --> 00:28:42.253
Our razor sharp claws will gut
'em and splatter their blood.

We can't go to war
with the whole town.


709
00:28:55.656 --> 00:28:58.136
We'll never find the moonstone
if they're on high alert.


710
00:28:59.095 --> 00:29:00.745
I hate it when you're right.

711
00:29:00.792 --> 00:29:02.842
Wolves, stand down.

712
00:29:06.102 --> 00:29:06.892
Okay.

713
00:29:08.887 --> 00:29:09.847
Sorry.

714
00:29:09.888 --> 00:29:12.538
We werewolves so admire
your town,


715
00:29:12.586 --> 00:29:16.026
and we just came here
to join your school.


716
00:29:16.503 --> 00:29:17.553
(murmurs of confusion)

717
00:29:17.591 --> 00:29:19.641
What? They can't join
our school.


718
00:29:19.942 --> 00:29:21.332
Technically the
Forbidden Forest


719
00:29:21.378 --> 00:29:23.378
is within the school district.

720

So, welcome to Seabrook!

Zed:
Zed for prez!


723
00:29:34.391 --> 00:29:37.521
Vote Zed for prez,
because I'm a zombie,


724
00:29:37.568 --> 00:29:39.738
not a zom-can't-be.

725
00:29:39.788 --> 00:29:41.218
Okay, here's our platform.

726
00:29:41.267 --> 00:29:43.527
We fight for zombie toppings
on pizza in the cafeteria.


727
00:29:43.574 --> 00:29:45.794
- Right.
- Get Zombie tongue taught
as a second language.


728
00:29:45.837 --> 00:29:48.707
- Good.
- And how to overthrow your oppressors after school club.


729
00:29:48.753 --> 00:29:50.933
- Eliza.
- Sorry, right. Don't over promise.


730
00:29:50.973 --> 00:29:53.583
But more importantly,
we allow zombies at Prawn.


731
00:29:53.627 --> 00:29:56.067
Good luck, Mr. 
Future President.

732
00:29:56.108 --> 00:29:57.978
Hey Zed, did you hear?

733
00:29:58.023 --> 00:29:59.333
Addie's being tested
for captain,


734
00:29:59.372 --> 00:30:00.982
and she gets to run
cheer practice tomorrow.


735
00:30:01.026 --> 00:30:02.376
It's not a big deal.

736
00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:04.769
Okay, it's huge.

737
00:30:04.813 --> 00:30:07.033
A huge chance to fail!

738
00:30:09.426 --> 00:30:12.076
If Addie aces this practice,
oh my gosh,


739
00:30:12.124 --> 00:30:14.474
she's so going to be cheer
captain once Bucky wins.


740
00:30:14.518 --> 00:30:16.428
He's so gonna win,
because you know, elections,


741
00:30:16.476 --> 00:30:18.696
they're just like these
big old popularity contests.


742
00:30:18.739 --> 00:30:20.569
And Bucky is super popular.

743
00:30:20.611 --> 00:30:22.701
- (clears throat)
- So... what?


744

Thanks, Bree.

745
00:30:26.356 --> 00:30:28.226
I know it's weird
I'll only be cheer captain

if Bucky's president, but...

747
00:30:29.707 --> 00:30:31.357
No, that just means
neither of us can lose,


748
00:30:31.404 --> 00:30:32.844
because one of us is going
to get what we want.

801
00:33:07.038 --> 00:33:08.688
we were outsiders, too.

802
00:33:08.735 --> 00:33:11.345
Which is why you need a great
president like Zed


803
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:13.040
to represent you.

804
00:33:13.566 --> 00:33:15.866
We'd be honored if you guys
joined us.


805
00:33:15.916 --> 00:33:18.436
Our pack is our pack.

806
00:33:18.484 --> 00:33:20.574
We don't need anyone else,
so...


807
00:33:20.617 --> 00:33:22.137
Zoey:
Who doesn't want more friends?


808
00:33:22.184 --> 00:33:25.144
Underneath all that fluffy hair,
I bet you're a real softie.


809
00:33:26.579 --> 00:33:29.669
I am a mean, mean werewolf,
kid.


810
00:33:29.713 --> 00:33:32.113
I am tough and rough.

811
00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:33.980
Aww, you said "ruff."

812
00:33:34.022 --> 00:33:35.372
Like a sweet little puppy dog.

813
00:33:35.414 --> 00:33:36.764
Ruff, ruff!

814
00:33:36.807 --> 00:33:40.807
We are beasts of the forest,
we will never be tamed.


815
00:33:40.854 --> 00:33:42.034
Oh boy.

816
00:33:42.073 --> 00:33:43.423
Oh wow, that's great.

817
00:33:43.466 --> 00:33:45.076
Oh wow.

818
00:33:46.077 --> 00:33:47.037
(whispers)
Sorry.


819
00:33:49.646 --> 00:33:51.206
We're nothing like you zombies.

820
00:33:51.256 --> 00:33:52.336
You sort of are.

821
00:33:52.388 --> 00:33:54.428
Your necklace is powered, right?

822
00:33:54.477 --> 00:33:56.697
Kind of like an organic Z-band.

823
00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.390
You're smarter than he looks.

824
00:34:00.004 --> 00:34:01.144
Thanks.

825
00:34:02.485 --> 00:34:03.745
That necklace keeps you
from fully wolfing out?


826
00:34:04.748 --> 00:34:05.618
The opposite.

827
00:34:06.924 --> 00:34:09.144
Our moonstones make us
our true werewolf selves.


828
00:34:10.145 --> 00:34:12.225
So without it you'd be human?

829
00:34:12.277 --> 00:34:13.927
No, we'd die.

830
00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.630
We'd be nothing.

831
00:34:17.761 --> 00:34:18.941
Imagine how alive you'd feel

832
00:34:18.979 --> 00:34:20.889
if you didn't have to tamp
things down.


833
00:34:20.938 --> 00:34:22.158
Hold back your true selves.

834
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:25.330
Actually, I've got this theory
that zombies might've evolved


835
00:34:25.377 --> 00:34:26.937
- beyond their need for Z-bands.
- (laughs uncomfortably)


836
00:34:26.987 --> 00:34:29.467
Z-bands are great.
They help you fit in.


837
00:34:30.339 --> 00:34:32.299
And I think you guys would have
a much better time at Seabrook


838
00:34:32.341 --> 00:34:33.781
if you just followed
in our footsteps.


839
00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.950
Join a club,
play football.


840
00:34:35.996 --> 00:34:37.346
I'll even teach you
how to tackle.


841
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:38.869
Just lighten up.

842
00:34:39.174 --> 00:34:40.134
Be more like us.

you deliver

a killer speech tomorrow, okay?
So the first step is...

but that's only because
people are lumping

What's wrong?

962
00:39:54.097 --> 00:39:56.057
Werewolves. They're not
interested in fitting in.


963
00:39:56.099 --> 00:39:57.409
They're into cheer.

964
00:39:57.448 --> 00:39:59.798
No, they're into you,
and you're into him... them.


965
00:39:59.842 --> 00:40:01.022
What?

966
00:40:02.453 --> 00:40:04.113
Why are you acting like this?

967
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:05.760
Do you know how hard it was
for zombies?


968
00:40:05.804 --> 00:40:07.854
Now everything is just being
handed to the werewolves


969
00:40:07.893 --> 00:40:09.683
- on a silver platter.
- Actually, they hate silver.


970
00:40:09.721 --> 00:40:12.461
I'm trying to win an election
for my people, for you.


971
00:40:12.507 --> 00:40:15.377
So we can go to Prawn,
so we can be accepted.


972
00:40:15.423 --> 00:40:17.253
That's not being accepted.

973
00:40:18.077 --> 00:40:20.117
That's being afraid to show
who you really are.


974
00:40:20.166 --> 00:40:21.906
Says the girl who wore a wig
her whole life.


975
00:40:25.955 --> 00:40:28.035
Yeah. I did.

976
00:40:29.045 --> 00:40:30.735
Because I always felt
like an outsider.


977
00:40:31.917 --> 00:40:35.007
And even though I might be
cheer captain, I still do.


978
00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:37.969
You know I don't have
a place here!


979
00:40:38.576 --> 00:40:40.316
Don't have a zombie crew.

980
00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.280
I don't know what I am!

981
00:40:42.319 --> 00:40:44.929
So excuse me for respecting
a pack of werewolves


982
00:40:44.974 --> 00:40:46.244
who are proud of
who they are.

Come with us.

1048
00:43:58.907 --> 00:44:00.387
What's so important?

1049
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:01.820
You are.

1050
00:44:15.097 --> 00:44:16.137
Where are we going?

1051
00:44:17.012 --> 00:44:18.232
It's a wolf secret.

1052
00:44:18.274 --> 00:44:20.494
If we told you,
we'd have to kill you.


1053
00:44:22.321 --> 00:44:23.981
Too much, too much,
I knew it.


1054
00:44:24.019 --> 00:44:25.109
Sorry.

1055
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.890
Welcome!

1056
00:44:28.458 --> 00:44:30.028
But not too welcome!

1057
00:44:30.939 --> 00:44:31.979
(hisses)

1058
00:44:32.027 --> 00:44:33.987
(coughs)

1059
00:44:34.029 --> 00:44:35.159
Are you okay?

1060
00:44:36.509 --> 00:44:38.689
My necklace is losing
its charge.


1061
00:44:39.774 --> 00:44:41.954
Every day, more and more
of our pack becomes sick


1062
00:44:41.993 --> 00:44:44.563
because their moonstones
lose their power.


1063
00:44:44.604 --> 00:44:47.044
All of our elders are too sick
to travel, which leaves...


1064
00:44:47.085 --> 00:44:49.475
...which leaves taking care of
the pack to us.


1065
00:44:49.522 --> 00:44:51.002
To me.

1066
00:44:53.526 --> 00:44:56.306
You'll be fine, Wynter.
I promise.


1067
00:44:57.792 --> 00:44:59.662
You'd better be right
about this.


1068
00:45:00.664 --> 00:45:02.934
We need to find
the moonstone soon.


1069
00:45:05.016 --> 00:45:05.886
Follow us, Addison.

1070
00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:07.630
Please.

1071
00:45:18.987 --> 00:45:20.287
You guys!

1072
00:45:20.336 --> 00:45:22.986
I have to go apologize
to Addison right now.


1073
00:45:23.034 --> 00:45:25.124
- Gruzah!
- Yeah I know, I want to see it too.


1074
00:45:25.167 --> 00:45:26.387
You know, ever since
football ended,


1075
00:45:26.429 --> 00:45:27.949
I've so missed watching you
get pummeled.


1076
00:45:27.996 --> 00:45:29.816
Announcer:
Attention citizens.


1077
00:45:29.867 --> 00:45:32.867
All curfews will be
strictly enforced.


1078
00:45:32.914 --> 00:45:33.924
(speaks Zombie)

1079
00:45:33.958 --> 00:45:35.528
Yeah, with the curfew
in effect,


1080
00:45:35.568 --> 00:45:38.308
it's gonna be nearly impossible
to get past the Z-patrol.


1081
00:45:38.354 --> 00:45:39.884
Hey guys!

1082
00:45:39.921 --> 00:45:41.051
And yet somehow
Bree just did.


1083
00:45:41.096 --> 00:45:43.186
Have you, have you guys
seen Addison?


1084
00:45:43.228 --> 00:45:45.618
She texted me for help,
but she's not home,


1085
00:45:45.665 --> 00:45:47.185
and she's not answering
her phone.


1086
00:45:48.059 --> 00:45:49.279
...Oh.

1087
00:45:49.321 --> 00:45:50.851
Hey, Bonzo.

1088
00:45:50.888 --> 00:45:52.188
(speaks Zombie)

1089
00:45:52.237 --> 00:45:53.107
(laughs)

1090
00:45:53.151 --> 00:45:54.721
You guys, focus!

1091
00:45:54.762 --> 00:45:55.552
Oh.

1092
00:45:56.285 --> 00:45:57.545
Addison needs help.

1093
00:45:57.590 --> 00:45:59.900
Okay, if her phone is on,
I can track her.


1094
00:45:59.941 --> 00:46:00.991
(beeping)

1095
00:46:07.035 --> 00:46:09.075
She's in the Forbidden Forest.

1096
00:46:09.124 --> 00:46:11.004
The wolves.
They kidnapped her.


1097
00:46:11.039 --> 00:46:12.209
You guys, we have
to help Addison.


1098
00:46:18.046 --> 00:46:20.046
The wolf den!

1099
00:46:20.788 --> 00:46:22.008
Addison: Wow.

1100
00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:25.310
It's okay to be impressed.

1101
00:46:25.357 --> 00:46:26.577
Wyatt:
Our language.


1102
00:46:26.619 --> 00:46:28.359
(howls)
Addison!


1103
00:46:28.404 --> 00:46:30.494
- That means welcome.
- (howls)


1104
00:46:30.536 --> 00:46:32.186
(laughing)

1105
00:46:32.234 --> 00:46:33.584
Ostrich boots?

1106
00:46:33.626 --> 00:46:34.756
No, I think Addison meant

1107
00:46:34.802 --> 00:46:36.152
(howls)

1108
00:46:36.194 --> 00:46:37.504
(howls)

1109
00:46:37.543 --> 00:46:39.423
- (laughing)
- Polka dot unicorn?


1110
00:46:39.458 --> 00:46:40.368
Cool, where?

1111
00:46:40.416 --> 00:46:42.846
Oh, no. Sorry, um.
Uh...


1112
00:46:42.897 --> 00:46:43.987
(howls briefly)

1113
00:46:44.028 --> 00:46:46.338
Whoa, whoa, language.

1114
00:46:46.378 --> 00:46:47.638
There are were-pups around.

1115
00:46:47.684 --> 00:46:50.824
She needs to put a pebble
in the swear-wolf jar.


1116
00:46:50.861 --> 00:46:54.041
(wolves howling)

1117
00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.780
I am so sorry.

1118
00:46:57.825 --> 00:46:59.215
Enough.

1119

her here.

a werewolf.

Zed!

Don't make me
take this off!


1192

No, stop!


1203
00:50:39.133 --> 00:50:41.613
Zed! I want to be here!

1204
00:50:41.657 --> 00:50:43.087
What?

1205
00:50:43.137 --> 00:50:44.617
But... but you texted
"Help!"


1206
00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.620
I needed help on
the chemistry homework.


1207
00:50:46.662 --> 00:50:48.492
Didn't you see
the beaker emoji?


1208
00:50:51.188 --> 00:50:53.018
Oh... I do now.

1209
00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:54.060
(laughs awkwardly)

1210
00:50:54.104 --> 00:50:56.374
By the way, I love
this new look.


1211
00:50:56.411 --> 00:50:57.671
New hairstylist?

1212
00:50:57.716 --> 00:50:59.586
Werewolves, they know hair.

1213
00:50:59.631 --> 00:51:01.071
And manicures.

1214
00:51:01.111 --> 00:51:02.681
All: Mmm-hmm.

1215
00:51:02.721 --> 00:51:04.331
They think I may be
a werewolf too.


1216
00:51:04.375 --> 00:51:06.065
What? How?

1217
00:51:06.116 --> 00:51:07.336
Maybe a grandparent.

1218
00:51:07.378 --> 00:51:10.208
My hair means something.
This could be my pack.


1219
00:51:10.251 --> 00:51:14.561
For centuries, this has been
set aside for the Great Alpha.


1220
00:51:15.908 --> 00:51:18.688
A fully charged moonstone
is priceless to us, Addison.


1221
00:51:18.737 --> 00:51:21.607
If you're truly one of us,
when you put it on,


1222
00:51:21.653 --> 00:51:23.263
you'll be transformed
into a werewolf.


1223
00:51:24.091 --> 00:51:26.621
Part of our pack, forever.

1224
00:51:27.137 --> 00:51:28.787
What? No!

1225
00:51:28.834 --> 00:51:29.714
Wait.

1226
00:51:30.836 --> 00:51:32.186
Can I think about it?

1227
00:51:36.146 --> 00:51:37.666
For a day.

1228
00:51:39.018 --> 00:51:41.628
Once you've joined us, you can
lead us to the hidden moonstone.


1229
00:51:41.673 --> 00:51:43.113
But she doesn't know
where it is.


1230
00:51:44.067 --> 00:51:45.017
Zed:
What?


1231
00:51:45.068 --> 00:51:47.898
(rumbling)

1232
00:51:55.905 --> 00:51:57.855
(speaks Zombie)

1233
00:51:58.342 --> 00:52:00.342
Yeah. The explosion came
from Seabrook Power.


1234
00:52:00.388 --> 00:52:02.958
They must be testing charges
for the demolition tomorrow.


1235
00:52:02.999 --> 00:52:04.999
Seabrook Power is the birthplace
of zombies.


1236
00:52:05.044 --> 00:52:06.354
Zed:
A little lime soda mixed


1237
00:52:06.394 --> 00:52:09.014
with some mysterious energy,
and bang!


1238
00:52:09.048 --> 00:52:09.828
Zombies.

1239
00:52:09.875 --> 00:52:11.305
(snarls)

1240
00:52:11.877 --> 00:52:14.747
Nice story, but it doesn't
concern us.


1241
00:52:14.793 --> 00:52:16.803
But it does concern you,
Willa.


1242
00:52:16.839 --> 00:52:20.319
Seabrook Power was fueled
by a mysterious energy source.


1243
00:52:21.626 --> 00:52:23.586
That could be your moonstone,
right?


1244
00:52:23.628 --> 00:52:25.848
She found the moonstone.

1245
00:52:25.891 --> 00:52:26.891
She's amazing.

1246
00:52:30.592 --> 00:52:31.682
Wyatt:
If she's right...


1247
00:52:32.071 --> 00:52:33.291
Wow.

1248
00:52:37.555 --> 00:52:39.205
We'll see you at school
tomorrow, Addison.


1249
00:52:39.253 --> 00:52:40.953
Okay. Tomorrow.

1250
00:52:40.993 --> 00:52:42.523
Big day.

1251
00:52:48.827 --> 00:52:50.047
If they destroy that building,

1252
00:52:50.089 --> 00:52:51.789
it'll crush the moonstone
underneath.


1253
00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:53.140
We can't let that happen.

1254
00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:55.490
- Addison can help.
- Maybe once she's one of us.


1255
00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:57.450
But until then,
I lead this pack.


1256
00:52:59.577 --> 00:53:02.007
We need to stop them from
destroying the moonstone.


1257
00:53:02.058 --> 00:53:03.228

Well, maybe I don't.

1278
00:54:05.121 --> 00:54:06.991
Maybe cheer team
isn't for me after all.


1279
00:54:07.036 --> 00:54:07.906
(Aceys gasps)

1280
00:54:10.866 --> 00:54:12.346
Addison!

1281
00:54:12.389 --> 00:54:13.999
I was up all night thinking.

1282
00:54:14.043 --> 00:54:15.613
You're not a werewolf,
you can't be.


1283
00:54:15.653 --> 00:54:17.313
But I love moonlight strolls.

1284
00:54:17.351 --> 00:54:18.531
Yeah, you like sunsets too.

1285
00:54:18.569 --> 00:54:19.569
That doesn't mean you're
a vampire.


1286
00:54:19.614 --> 00:54:21.144
- Zed...
- Look.


1287
00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:23.920
It's really hard being
considered a monster.


1288
00:54:23.966 --> 00:54:25.046
Trust me.

1289
00:54:25.097 --> 00:54:27.837
All I've ever wanted
is to find my pack.


1290
00:54:29.014 --> 00:54:30.894
And now I finally have.

1291
00:54:36.195 --> 00:54:38.675
When I see the wolves,
I'm going to put this on.


1292
00:54:39.634 --> 00:54:42.074
And I'm really sorry I can't
make the debate,


1293
00:54:42.114 --> 00:54:44.034
but I need to find the wolves.

1294
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:48.900
Good luck.

1295
00:54:54.213 --> 00:54:56.913
Whoops, almost forgot.
You'll do great, Zed.


1296
00:55:00.045 --> 00:55:01.395
Are you ready for the debate?

1297
00:55:01.438 --> 00:55:02.868
Come on, we're going
to be late.


1298
00:55:06.965 --> 00:55:08.315
You're going to prove
to everyone


1299
00:55:08.358 --> 00:55:09.098
that we're more than just...

1300
00:55:09.141 --> 00:55:10.011
...Monsters.

1301
00:55:13.015 --> 00:55:15.405
- Bucky made me look...
- ...Scary.


1302
00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:27.460
Announcer:
Attention, attention.


1303
00:55:27.508 --> 00:55:30.468
This is an active
demolition site.


1304
00:55:30.511 --> 00:55:34.381
All personnel please
evacuate immediately.


1305
00:55:34.428 --> 00:55:37.908
Demolition is scheduled
for 5:00 PM this evening.


1306
00:55:39.041 --> 00:55:41.041
All right, we don't have
much time.


1307
00:55:41.086 --> 00:55:43.176
This is how we sabotage
the demolition and stop them.


1308
00:55:43.219 --> 00:55:46.309
It's my responsibility to make
sure we're all safe.


1309
00:55:46.353 --> 00:55:47.963
We follow my lead.

1310
00:55:48.006 --> 00:55:49.656
It's a good plan, Willa.

1311
00:55:49.704 --> 00:55:51.144
Addison:
What plan?


1312
00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:53.100
We're going after
the moonstone.


1313
00:55:53.142 --> 00:55:54.062
Top secret.

1314
00:55:54.099 --> 00:55:55.799
You can't tell anyone.

1315
00:55:57.102 --> 00:55:59.102
Bad wolf, bad wolf!

1316
00:55:59.409 --> 00:56:00.499
You're going after
the moonstone now?


1317
00:56:00.715 --> 00:56:01.885
It won't survive
the detonation.


1318
00:56:02.194 --> 00:56:03.284
Then let me join you.

1319
00:56:03.326 --> 00:56:04.936
I'm ready to become
a wolf.


1320
00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:06.550
If you really are one.

1321
00:56:08.984 --> 00:56:10.074
(gasps)

1322
00:56:10.115 --> 00:56:10.935
It's gone.

1323
00:56:10.986 --> 00:56:12.116
You lost it?

1324
00:56:13.423 --> 00:56:15.773
Do you know how precious
a moonstone necklace is?


1325
00:56:15.817 --> 00:56:17.647
If she was serious
about being a wolf,


1326
00:56:17.688 --> 00:56:19.648
if she was the Great Alpha,

1327
00:56:19.690 --> 00:56:21.130
she wouldn't have been
so careless.


1328
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:22.690
No, I... I don't know how!
I...


1329
00:56:22.737 --> 00:56:24.567
Stay out of our amazing hair.

1330
00:56:33.617 --> 00:56:34.917
You got your speech?

1331
00:56:39.406 --> 00:56:40.926
Addison's necklace?

1332
00:56:42.583 --> 00:56:43.543
I took it.

1333
00:56:43.584 --> 00:56:45.194
I can't let her become
a werewolf.


1334
00:56:45.237 --> 00:56:46.757
I have to protect her.

1335
00:56:46.804 --> 00:56:48.554
All of this,
running for president,


1336
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:49.549
it's all for her.

1337
00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:50.590
No, Zed.

1338
00:56:50.634 --> 00:56:52.244
This is bigger than that,
okay?


1339
00:56:52.288 --> 00:56:55.028
This is for you, for me,
for all zombies everywhere.


1340
00:56:55.073 --> 00:56:57.083
This is more important
than anything else.


1341
00:56:57.815 --> 00:56:59.765
Look, we'll deal
with this later, okay?


1342
00:56:59.817 --> 00:57:01.037
Just become president.

1343
00:57:01.079 --> 00:57:02.859
That's what zombies need.

1344
00:57:06.476 --> 00:57:08.036
(exhales)

1345
00:57:09.044 --> 00:57:11.444
(cheering)

1346
00:57:11.916 --> 00:57:14.436
Your first nominee for...

1347
00:57:16.094 --> 00:57:17.274
Running for president,

1348
00:57:17.313 --> 00:57:20.013
wearing the sequined
Mighty Shrimp uniform...


1349
00:57:20.055 --> 00:57:21.575
Three time MVP,

1350
00:57:21.622 --> 00:57:24.762
lean, mean, cheering machine...

1351
00:57:24.799 --> 00:57:27.449
And captain of our hearts...

1352
00:57:27.497 --> 00:57:29.057
All: Bucky!

1353
00:57:29.456 --> 00:57:30.756
(loud cheering)

1354
00:57:30.805 --> 00:57:33.625
(dance music fanfare)

1355
00:57:38.465 --> 00:57:39.935
Your other candidate of...

1356
00:57:39.988 --> 00:57:41.468
Why not?

1357
00:57:41.511 --> 00:57:44.601
Introducing our soon-to-be
first green-haired president


1358
00:57:44.645 --> 00:57:47.465
and repping a proud people,
Zed!


1359
00:57:47.517 --> 00:57:50.167
(loud cheering)

1360
00:57:53.131 --> 00:57:54.131
Hear him roar!

1361
00:57:54.176 --> 00:57:55.256
(growls)

1362
00:57:55.307 --> 00:57:57.177
Um no, actually, we're not
going to roar.


1363
00:57:57.222 --> 00:57:58.222
No roaring.

1364
00:57:58.267 --> 00:57:59.397
Zed'll fight for you!

1365
00:57:59.442 --> 00:58:01.142
You know what, um,
I'm not going to fight.


1366
00:58:01.183 --> 00:58:02.923
'Cause, no, this isn't
a fight.


1367
00:58:02.967 --> 00:58:06.967
This is just a nice lil' cordial
debate we're having here today.


1368
00:58:07.015 --> 00:58:08.835
Good to hear, Zed.
(laughs)


1369
00:58:08.886 --> 00:58:10.056
Oh, did you see that?

1370
00:58:10.105 --> 00:58:11.495
That was a high-five.

1371
00:58:11.541 --> 00:58:12.541
No.

1372
00:58:12.586 --> 00:58:14.976
Are you ready to battle?

01:07:49.727 --> 01:07:51.817
I know how hard you worked
to get this job.


1623
01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:52.950
But if it's gonna hurt
the werewolves,


1624
01:07:52.991 --> 01:07:54.381
you have to stop it.

1625
01:07:59.389 --> 01:08:00.959
You're right.

01:08:00.999 --> 01:08:02.699
And Addison's right.

Shut it down.

Stop the detonation.

1629
01:08:05.308 --> 01:08:07.138
Tomorrow, when it's safe,

1630
01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:08.700
we'll find what
you're looking for.

you can all go home.

Addison.

1639
01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:41.132
I'm gonna lose the election,

1640
01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:43.040
which means I can't take
you to Prawn.


1641
01:08:43.085 --> 01:08:44.475
That's okay, Zed.

1642
01:08:44.521 --> 01:08:46.441
We cannot go to
the Prawn together.


1643
01:08:56.272 --> 01:08:57.712
He found it!

1644

(laughs)

1645
01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:01.229
Thank you.

1646
01:09:04.933 --> 01:09:07.283
- What?
- I took it.


1647
01:09:09.546 --> 01:09:11.286
I stole it when
you weren't looking.


1648
01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.200
I thought I lost it.

1649
01:09:16.466 --> 01:09:18.336
- I questioned myself.
- Addison, I'm sorry.


1650
01:09:18.381 --> 01:09:20.561
I was afraid that if you turned
into a wolf, I'd lose you.


1651
01:09:20.601 --> 01:09:21.991
You don't get to make
that choice for me!


1652
01:09:22.037 --> 01:09:22.947
But a werewolf?

1653
01:09:22.994 --> 01:09:24.434
I finally find where
I belong,


1654
01:09:24.474 --> 01:09:26.224
and you try to steal that
from me?


1655
01:09:26.259 --> 01:09:29.129
Why would I ever go to the Prawn
with you after what you did?


1656
01:09:47.932 --> 01:09:49.332
Am I?

1657
01:09:53.764 --> 01:09:55.244
You're beautiful, Addie,

1658
01:09:56.419 --> 01:09:59.769
but the same beautiful
that you've always been.


1659
01:10:03.078 --> 01:10:04.508
She's not a werewolf.

1660
01:10:09.127 --> 01:10:12.827
Oh my gosh, boss, boss!
We got a problem!


1661
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:14.350
- What?
- The remote shorted out,


1662
01:10:14.394 --> 01:10:15.924
and now the detonation
timer's running.


1663
01:10:17.048 --> 01:10:18.008
Zevon:
Well, shut it off!


1664
01:10:18.049 --> 01:10:19.749
I can't.

(screaming)

1753
01:15:58.085 --> 01:15:59.695
You're supposed to protect
your president!


1754
01:15:59.739 --> 01:16:00.699
(yelps)

1755

(screaming)

1757
01:16:21.195 --> 01:16:23.845
Zed: The energy from the moonstone
must've created the fault line.


1758
01:16:23.893 --> 01:16:25.633
Willa:
What?


1759
01:16:25.678 --> 01:16:26.898
Zed: If we follow this crack,
it may lead us to the moonstone.


1760
01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:28.990
So it's only buried
and not destroyed.


1761
01:16:29.029 --> 01:16:32.029
(rumbling)

1762
01:16:33.729 --> 01:16:35.039
We have to get to it.

1763
01:16:35.078 --> 01:16:36.598
Quickly, while we still can.

1764
01:16:46.176 --> 01:16:47.436
It's this way.

1765
01:16:47.482 --> 01:16:48.612
I see the light.

1766
01:16:48.657 --> 01:16:50.617
It's coming
from Seabrook Power.


1767
01:17:06.066 --> 01:17:07.066
Here it is!

1768
01:17:16.032 --> 01:17:17.602
(growling)

1769
01:17:20.733 --> 01:17:21.913
(screams)

1770
01:17:21.951 --> 01:17:23.341
We have to move it out of here.

1771
01:17:23.387 --> 01:17:25.997
Legend says that together,
our pack can move the stone.


1772
01:17:26.042 --> 01:17:27.702
All of us, lift!

1773
01:17:28.479 --> 01:17:30.259
(grunting)

1774
01:17:31.439 --> 01:17:32.529
It's too heavy.

1775
01:17:33.093 --> 01:17:34.143
There's not enough of us.

1776
01:17:34.964 --> 01:17:36.754
Then maybe you need to expand
your pack.


1777
01:17:37.488 --> 01:17:38.448
Addison?

1778
01:17:38.489 --> 01:17:40.269
(rumbling)

1779
01:17:40.317 --> 01:17:41.407
We came here to help.

1780
01:17:41.449 --> 01:17:42.669
Come on, everyone.
We got this!


1781
01:17:42.711 --> 01:17:44.021
Right.

1782
01:17:45.453 --> 01:17:48.633
Hurry, before it's too late!
Together lift!


1783
01:17:48.674 --> 01:17:52.684
(rumbling)

1784
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:55.160
Chamber's collapsed.

1785
01:17:55.202 --> 01:17:56.382
We can't carry the moonstone
through.


1786
01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:57.510
Eliza: Your Z-band,
it's still broken.


1787
01:17:57.552 --> 01:17:59.692
Zed, take it off.
Lift the slab.


1788
01:17:59.728 --> 01:18:00.858
Okay, Zed, you can
do this.


1789
01:18:00.903 --> 01:18:02.513
I'm not ready. What if
I can't control it?


1790
01:18:02.557 --> 01:18:03.557
All: Oh!

1791
01:18:05.081 --> 01:18:07.001
Zed, you have to.

1792
01:18:18.965 --> 01:18:20.005
(roar)

1793
01:18:20.053 --> 01:18:21.103
Yes!

1794
01:18:21.924 --> 01:18:23.494
Addison:
Come on, you can do this.


1795
01:18:30.454 --> 01:18:33.944
(loud grunts)

1796
01:18:42.945 --> 01:18:44.945
(roar)

1797
01:18:51.824 --> 01:18:53.134
Oh, no!

1798
01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:57.830
Zed!

1799
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:08.009
(rapid beeping)

1800
01:19:09.363 --> 01:19:10.453
(cheering)

1801
01:19:11.974 --> 01:19:14.194
Zed! Are you okay?

1802
01:19:14.237 --> 01:19:15.277
Yeah.

1803
01:19:15.325 --> 01:19:16.365
I'm me.

1804
01:19:17.675 --> 01:19:19.285
We crushed it!
We nailed it!


1805
01:19:19.329 --> 01:19:22.119
We so rock! Yes!

1806
01:19:23.333 --> 01:19:24.473
Too much?

1807
01:19:25.074 --> 01:19:26.164
Perfect.

1808
01:19:26.206 --> 01:19:27.946
(laughs)
We did it.


1809
01:19:29.035 --> 01:19:29.815
Say "brains."

1810
01:19:29.862 --> 01:19:31.212
Both: Brains!

1811
01:19:31.254 --> 01:19:32.434
(camera shutter snaps)

1812
01:19:33.996 --> 01:19:35.736
We're getting our first zombie
on the Prawn wall of fame.

(all howling)

1814
01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:45.310
Hey, you said that perfectly.

1815
01:19:46.052 --> 01:19:48.012
Bonzo's got an ear
