00:00:57.306 --> 00:01:00.616
Whoa! It's raining cats
and dogs out there!


2
00:01:00.652 --> 00:01:02.412
I hope they make it
back all right.


3
00:01:02.448 --> 00:01:04.548
Heads up! Andy's coming!

4
00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:08.168
Andy, time for dinner.

5
00:01:08.204 --> 00:01:09.492
Yes! I'm starving!

6
00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:10.743
Don't forget
to wash your hands!


7
00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:12.134
Okay, Mom!

8
00:01:16.077 --> 00:01:17.597
- Do you see him?
- No.


9
00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:18.822
Well, he's done for.

10
00:01:18.858 --> 00:01:20.363
He'll be lost! Forever!

11
00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.306
Jessie. Buzz. Slink.
Molly's room.


12
00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:24.018
The rest of you,
stay put.


13
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.782
Bo!

14
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.641
Situation?

15
00:01:47.884 --> 00:01:49.171
Lost toy.
Side yard.


16
00:01:49.207 --> 00:01:51.624
Billy. Goat. Gruff.
Raise the blinds.


17
00:01:52.572 --> 00:01:54.771
They have names?
You never told me that.


18
00:01:54.807 --> 00:01:56.128
You never asked.

19
00:01:56.878 --> 00:01:58.010
Where is he?

20
00:01:59.375 --> 00:01:59.938
There!

21
00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:01.375
How do we reach him?

22
00:02:01.422 --> 00:02:03.011
Operation Pull
-Toy!

23
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:04.623
- Slink!
- You got it, Woody!


24
00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:05.788
Barbies!

25
00:02:13.807 --> 00:02:14.808
Go!

26
00:02:21.155 --> 00:02:22.322
Flashlight.

27
00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:39.474
Hang on, R.C.!

28
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.407
I ain't got any more slink!

29
00:03:29.047 --> 00:03:29.945
Oh, it's beautiful.

30
00:03:30.015 --> 00:03:30.913
I'm so glad to see

31
00:03:30.975 --> 00:03:32.696
this old lamp
go to a good home.


32
00:03:32.756 --> 00:03:34.522
We've had it since
Molly was a baby.


33
00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:37.080
Molly, are you sure
it's all right?


34
00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.602
Yeah,
I don't want it anymore.


35
00:03:38.683 --> 00:03:40.250
Thank you.

36
00:03:47.047 --> 00:03:48.448
Where's Woody?

37
00:03:56.795 --> 00:03:58.374
Yeah, hi. I think
I left my keys here.


38
00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:01.207
- Woody.
- Quick!


39
00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:03.054
We'll sneak in the hedges
before he's back.


40
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.022
Woody, it's okay.

41
00:04:05.085 --> 00:04:07.467
What? No! No, no, no.
You can't go!


42
00:04:07.545 --> 00:04:08.452
What's best for Andy
is that...


43
00:04:08.522 --> 00:04:09.773
Woody.

44
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.587
I'm not Andy's toy.

45
00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:13.640
What?

46
00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:15.723
It's time for
the next kid.


47
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.456
Oh, and thank you again
for everything.


48
00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:18.700
I really appreciate it.

49
00:04:18.776 --> 00:04:21.038
Oh, my pleasure.
I'm glad it all worked out.


50
00:04:23.025 --> 00:04:26.759
You know, kids lose
their toys every day.


51
00:04:28.078 --> 00:04:30.645
Sometimes they get
left in the yard...


52
00:04:31.049 --> 00:04:33.250
or put in the wrong box.

53
00:04:38.157 --> 00:04:41.599
And that box
gets taken away.


54
00:04:49.514 --> 00:04:50.648
Mom, where's Woody?

55
00:04:50.748 --> 00:04:52.415
Andy! Come inside!

56
00:04:52.515 --> 00:04:53.888
I can't find Woody!

57
00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:15.882
Well, good night.

58
00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:17.916
Goodbye.
Drive safe.


59
00:05:37.682 --> 00:05:39.749
Oh, there you are.

60
00:05:39.848 --> 00:05:41.716
Mom, I found him!
I found him!


61
00:05:41.815 --> 00:05:44.781
Oh, good.
Come on and get inside.

when Mom quickly cleans
the bedroom like that...


99

Sheriff,
do I need to be worried?


106
00:07:55.019 --> 00:07:57.111
No, no. My guys are veterans.
They'll hang in there.


107
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:59.257
Good. Just keep them calm
until we get word.


108
00:07:59.356 --> 00:08:00.456
Yes, ma'am.

109
00:08:03.455 --> 00:08:05.424
How are you, uh,
feeling about today?


110
00:08:05.523 --> 00:08:07.891
Uh, good, good.
Yeah, good.


111
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.256
I'm good.

112
00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:10.756
Uh... Good.

with breakfast!


114

- Any minute now.
- You hear that?


115
00:08:16.583 --> 00:08:17.946
Any minute now.

116
00:08:17.985 --> 00:08:18.993
Wind 'em if you got 'em.

117
00:08:19.063 --> 00:08:20.903
Keep your batteries clean,
your joints unlocked...


118
00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.060
Uh, thanks, Woody.
I got it.


119
00:08:22.123 --> 00:08:24.357
Yes, I'm sorry.
You're right, you're right.


120
00:08:25.646 --> 00:08:28.164

121
00:08:28.242 --> 00:08:29.223
Hi, Mayor!

122
00:08:29.324 --> 00:08:30.116
Banker!

123
00:08:30.179 --> 00:08:32.521
Hi, Ice-Cream Man!
Hi, Hat Shop Owner!


124
00:08:32.584 --> 00:08:33.389
Mailman!

125
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:34.958
And the sheriff!

126
00:08:35.795 --> 00:08:37.656
Okay. Bye, toys!

127
00:08:37.937 --> 00:08:39.976
Yee-haw! Sheriff Jessie!

128
00:08:40.046 --> 00:08:41.457
Giddy-up, Bullseye!

129
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:48.791
They went that way!

130
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:49.923
Chase them!

131
00:08:53.752 --> 00:08:55.656
What a beautiful hat shop!
You have so many hats...


132
00:08:55.757 --> 00:08:57.828
Wow.
They're doing "hat shop."


133
00:08:57.864 --> 00:08:58.624
When's the last time

134
00:08:58.724 --> 00:08:59.964
we ever got to play that?

135
00:09:00.024 --> 00:09:01.490
Remember when
she played "house"?


136
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:02.657
I liked "house."

137
00:09:02.757 --> 00:09:03.791
Those were the days.

138
00:09:03.891 --> 00:09:05.457
It was basic.
You made a house,


139
00:09:05.557 --> 00:09:06.624
you lived in it, done.

140
00:09:06.724 --> 00:09:08.270
Hmm. That's
the third time


141
00:09:08.306 --> 00:09:09.678
you haven't been
picked this week.


142
00:09:09.714 --> 00:09:11.058
I don't know.
I don't keep count.


143
00:09:11.158 --> 00:09:12.757
Oh, you don't have to.

144
00:09:12.856 --> 00:09:14.890
- I'll do it for you.
- Okay, okay, okay, I get it.


145
00:09:14.991 --> 00:09:16.024
It's been a while.

146
00:09:16.124 --> 00:09:16.823
Oh, looky there.

147
00:09:16.922 --> 00:09:18.891
You got your
first dust bunny.


148
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:20.724
Aw, how adorable.

149
00:09:20.823 --> 00:09:22.023
What you gonna name it?

150
00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:23.123
Uh, what about Dusty?

151
00:09:23.224 --> 00:09:24.308
- Francis!
- Harry!


152
00:09:24.344 --> 00:09:25.390
- Karen!
- Fuzzball!


153
00:09:25.426 --> 00:09:26.469
- LeBron?
- No, Fluffy.


154
00:09:26.505 --> 00:09:28.101
- How about Thumper?
- Tumbleweed!


155
00:09:28.137 --> 00:09:29.916
"Tumbleweed." Oh,
that's good. That's good.


156
00:09:29.952 --> 00:09:31.007
He's a cowboy,

157
00:09:31.043 --> 00:09:32.541
so that makes a lot of sense.

158
00:09:32.577 --> 00:09:33.976
So many choices.

159
00:09:34.012 --> 00:09:35.489
I just can't decide!

160
00:09:35.567 --> 00:09:36.376
Bonnie?

161
00:09:36.412 --> 00:09:37.997
What are you doing?
We gotta go.


162
00:09:38.033 --> 00:09:38.534
You don't wanna be late

163
00:09:38.597 --> 00:09:40.271
for kindergarten
orientation, do you?


164
00:09:40.333 --> 00:09:42.990
But I don't wanna go.

165
00:09:43.061 --> 00:09:44.114
We talked about this.

166
00:09:44.168 --> 00:09:45.193
We're gonna meet
your teachers,


167
00:09:45.255 --> 00:09:47.360
- see your classroom...
- Can I bring a toy?


168
00:09:47.423 --> 00:09:50.024
Toys don't go to school,
that's the rule.


169
00:09:54.156 --> 00:09:55.523
Freeze! Nobody move!

170
00:09:55.624 --> 00:09:56.857
Bonnie always
forgets something.


171
00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.390
She'll be back any second.

172
00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:59.828
That goes for you, too, Hamm.

173
00:09:59.864 --> 00:10:00.997
But it's money!

174
00:10:01.623 --> 00:10:02.656
You all right, Woody?

175
00:10:02.756 --> 00:10:03.890
I'm sure she'll pick you
next time.


176
00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:06.286
Oh, come on, I'm fine.
No problem.


177
00:10:06.349 --> 00:10:07.248
Hey, Woody. Here.

178
00:10:07.302 --> 00:10:08.457
Oh, thanks, Jessie.

179
00:10:08.557 --> 00:10:10.690
We're here for you,
buddy.


180
00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:11.891
I don't want to play
the baker.


181
00:10:11.991 --> 00:10:12.632
Pricklepants.

182
00:10:12.702 --> 00:10:15.269
The hat shop owner is
the role I was born to play!


183
00:10:15.324 --> 00:10:16.751
All right, Pricklepants,
back to your bakery.


184
00:10:16.813 --> 00:10:17.576
Excuse me, Dolly?

185
00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:19.375
Woody, can't you see
I'm threatening everyone?


186
00:10:19.436 --> 00:10:19.942
Go back to the closet.

187
00:10:19.996 --> 00:10:21.551
Yeah, I know, I know.
It's just...


188
00:10:21.606 --> 00:10:22.856
I'm worried
about Bonnie.


189
00:10:22.892 --> 00:10:24.776
A toy should go with her
to orientation.


190
00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:26.935
Didn't you hear Dad?
You'll get Bonnie in trouble.


191
00:10:26.971 --> 00:10:28.732
Yeah, but kindergarten
is so different.


192
00:10:28.768 --> 00:10:30.436
It can be too much
for a kid.


193
00:10:30.491 --> 00:10:31.555
Having a buddy with them
to get through it


194
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:32.710
can really help things.

195
00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:34.262
I remember with Andy,
I would go to school with him...


196
00:10:34.298 --> 00:10:35.572
Uh-huh. I'm sorry, Woody,

197
00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:36.910
I hate to sound
like a broken record...


198
00:10:36.946 --> 00:10:38.278
but Bonnie's not Andy.

199
00:10:38.314 --> 00:10:39.855
No, no, no, of course,
I get that.


200
00:10:39.891 --> 00:10:41.230
But if you would just...

201
00:10:41.308 --> 00:10:42.890
Places, everyone!

202
00:10:56.417 --> 00:10:57.890
Bonnie?

203
00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.152
What are you doing
back there?


204
00:11:00.238 --> 00:11:01.794
Come on, we have to go.

205
00:11:04.413 --> 00:11:06.176
That's my big girl.

206
00:11:06.262 --> 00:11:09.241
Come on.
We gotta hurry, okay?


207
00:11:09.479 --> 00:11:11.355
Don't forget your backpack.

208
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.416
You're gonna
have so much fun.


209
00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.006
All right. Now what was it
you were saying, Woody?


210
00:11:19.677 --> 00:11:21.146
Woody?

211
00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:30.122
Here we are.

212
00:11:46.645 --> 00:11:48.966
Bonnie, honey,
it'll be okay.


213
00:11:49.055 --> 00:11:51.174
Hi! Are you Bonnie?

214
00:11:51.275 --> 00:11:52.424
My name is Miss Wendy.

215
00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:54.461
I'm going to be
your kindergarten teacher.


216
00:11:56.423 --> 00:11:59.600
We have a special place where
you can put your backpack.


217
00:11:59.657 --> 00:12:01.191
You want to see?

218
00:12:20.988 --> 00:12:23.161
Here we are, Bonnie.
Just for you.


219
00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.073
Okay, class,
let's all find a seat at a table...


220
00:12:26.136 --> 00:12:28.106
so we can
start craft time.


221
00:12:28.326 --> 00:12:29.340
On the first day of school,

222
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.674
you'll need a place
to put your pencils.


223
00:12:31.774 --> 00:12:35.174
So, today, we're going
to make pencil holders.


224
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:37.375
Now, everyone take a cup...

225
00:12:37.526 --> 00:12:41.060
and we'll use the art
supplies to decorate them.


226
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.408
Hi.

227
00:14:10.244 --> 00:14:12.858
Bonnie.
That is so clever.


228
00:14:12.898 --> 00:14:16.008
"Hello, I'm Forky.
Nice to meet you!"


229
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:17.984
Well, hello, Forky,
it's nice to meet you.


230
00:14:18.059 --> 00:14:19.392
I'm Miss Wendy.

231
00:14:22.122 --> 00:14:24.307
Mom! Dad!
Look what I made!


232
00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:25.439
His name is Forky!

233
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.201
- Wow!
- That is so cool!


234
00:14:27.294 --> 00:14:29.106
I finished kindergarten!

235
00:14:29.551 --> 00:14:30.672
Uh...

236
00:14:30.719 --> 00:14:33.086
No.
That was just orientation.


237
00:14:33.156 --> 00:14:34.607
But for being
such a brave girl,


238
00:14:34.662 --> 00:14:36.066
we have a surprise
for you.


239
00:14:36.102 --> 00:14:36.892
What is it?

240
00:14:36.928 --> 00:14:37.777
Since school doesn't start

241
00:14:37.813 --> 00:14:40.850
for another week,
we are going on a road trip!


242
00:14:40.886 --> 00:14:42.773
- Can I bring Forky?
- 'Course you can!


243
00:14:42.874 --> 00:14:44.206
Yay!

244
00:14:49.231 --> 00:14:52.373
And they said I shouldn't
go to school with Bonnie.


245
00:14:52.757 --> 00:14:55.422
We got this kindergarten thing
under control, eh?


246
00:14:55.492 --> 00:14:57.797
I can't believe
I'm talking to a spork.


247
00:15:07.411 --> 00:15:08.978
Hi, toys!
Bye, toys!


248
00:15:09.795 --> 00:15:11.329
Ow.

249
00:15:15.082 --> 00:15:16.439
He did go
to kindergarten!


250
00:15:16.539 --> 00:15:17.431
- I knew it.
- No, no, no, guys, listen...


251
00:15:17.467 --> 00:15:18.687
You tryin' to get
Bonnie in trouble?


252
00:15:18.723 --> 00:15:19.818
No, of course not!

253
00:15:19.854 --> 00:15:21.206
You could have been
confiscated.


254
00:15:21.306 --> 00:15:22.940
- What does that mean?
- Taken away.


255
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.348
- No!
- Or worse.


256
00:15:24.384 --> 00:15:25.518
You could've been lost!

257
00:15:25.554 --> 00:15:26.683
No, no, no, guys, listen.

258
00:15:26.719 --> 00:15:28.428
Bonnie had a great day
in class...


259
00:15:28.464 --> 00:15:29.904
and we're going
on a road trip.


260
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.314
- Road trip?
- Vacation!


261
00:15:31.368 --> 00:15:32.157
Yee-haw!

262
00:15:32.212 --> 00:15:34.336
But then something
really weird happened.


263
00:15:34.383 --> 00:15:36.064
Bonnie made
a friend in class.


264
00:15:36.126 --> 00:15:36.790
What a kid.

265
00:15:36.837 --> 00:15:38.215
Oh, she's already
making friends.


266
00:15:38.285 --> 00:15:41.407
No, no. She literally made
a new friend.


267
00:15:41.686 --> 00:15:43.603
Hey, it's okay.

268
00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:45.270
Come on out.
That's it.


269
00:15:45.306 --> 00:15:47.736
Come on, there you go.

270
00:15:49.929 --> 00:15:51.939
Come on, let's get
you out of there.


271
00:15:51.986 --> 00:15:53.382
You got this.

272
00:15:53.437 --> 00:15:55.338
Good. Good.

273
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.553
Everyone, I want you
to meet Forky.


274
00:15:58.615 --> 00:16:00.224
- Golly bob howdy!
- Look at that!


275
00:16:00.323 --> 00:16:02.489
Look how long
his arms are!


276
00:16:02.589 --> 00:16:04.489
- Trash?
- No.


277
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.357
No, toys.

278
00:16:06.456 --> 00:16:08.210
They're all toys.

279
00:16:10.324 --> 00:16:11.924
- Trash?
- No, no, no.


280
00:16:12.024 --> 00:16:13.432
That's the trash.

281
00:16:13.502 --> 00:16:15.224
These are your friends.

282
00:16:15.324 --> 00:16:16.737
Hi!

283
00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:18.423
Trash!

284
00:16:18.523 --> 00:16:19.623
- No, no, it's okay.
- Trash!


285
00:16:19.723 --> 00:16:21.391
Woody,
I have a question.


286
00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:22.768
Um, well, actually,
not just one,


287
00:16:22.804 --> 00:16:24.124
I have all of them.

288
00:16:24.224 --> 00:16:25.523
I have all the questions.

289
00:16:25.622 --> 00:16:27.346
Uh, why does he want
to go to the trash?


290
00:16:27.393 --> 00:16:28.991
Because he was made
from trash.


291
00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:29.623
Trash!

292
00:16:29.659 --> 00:16:31.458
Look, I know
this is a little strange,


293
00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:32.599
but you gotta trust me
on this.


294
00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:33.166
Trash?

295
00:16:33.228 --> 00:16:37.461
Forky is the most important
toy to Bonnie right now.


296
00:16:37.505 --> 00:16:38.388
Important?

297
00:16:38.441 --> 00:16:39.335
He's a spork.

298
00:16:39.405 --> 00:16:41.478
Yes. Yeah, I know,
but this spork...


299
00:16:41.564 --> 00:16:43.555
this toy is crucial to Bonnie

300
00:16:43.656 --> 00:16:46.057
getting adjusted
to kindergarten. Oh.


301
00:16:46.156 --> 00:16:46.881
Woody, aren't you being

302
00:16:46.943 --> 00:16:48.290
a little dramatic
about all this?


303
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:49.808
I know this is new
to everybody...


304
00:16:49.855 --> 00:16:50.923
but you should see how much

305
00:16:50.985 --> 00:16:52.879
this little guy
means to Bonnie.


306
00:16:52.933 --> 00:16:55.391
When she started
playing with him...


307
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.698
she had the biggest smile
on her face.


308
00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.027
I wish you could have seen it.

309
00:16:59.098 --> 00:17:00.181
Bonnie was really upset...

310
00:17:00.259 --> 00:17:02.024
and I swear,
once she made Forky...


311
00:17:02.124 --> 00:17:03.940
it was
a complete transformation.


312
00:17:03.987 --> 00:17:05.689
- Uh, Woody?
- Just a second, Jessie.


313
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:09.979
So, we all have to make sure
nothing happens to him.


314
00:17:10.033 --> 00:17:11.556
Something happened to him.

315
00:17:12.873 --> 00:17:14.590
Oh, Chutes and Ladders!

316
00:17:14.689 --> 00:17:15.719
Ah, trash.

317
00:17:15.782 --> 00:17:16.800
- No, no, no!
- No! No!


318
00:17:16.878 --> 00:17:18.189
You're a toy now, Forky!
Come on!


319
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:19.423
Stop! Stop it!

320
00:17:19.509 --> 00:17:21.055
- Hey! No, no, no! Come on!
- Trash!


321
00:17:21.133 --> 00:17:22.244
Trash! Trash!

322
00:17:22.298 --> 00:17:24.542
Well, I guess
I'll just babysit him


323
00:17:24.578 --> 00:17:25.989
till he's used
to the room.


324
00:17:29.191 --> 00:17:30.726
Hmm.

325
00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.386
Forky?

326
00:17:34.531 --> 00:17:36.432
Where are you, Forky?

327
00:17:37.005 --> 00:17:38.086
There you are!

328
00:17:38.164 --> 00:17:40.223
I thought I'd lost you, silly.

329
00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:56.291
No, no, no.
Big girl scary!


330
00:17:56.389 --> 00:17:59.089
Like I said before,
Bonnie's not scary.


331
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.786
She loves you
and you need to...


332
00:18:00.877 --> 00:18:02.445
Ooh.

333
00:18:18.769 --> 00:18:20.436
Forky?

334
00:18:22.921 --> 00:18:24.522
Bonnie!

335
00:18:24.622 --> 00:18:25.656
Let's go!

336
00:18:25.756 --> 00:18:27.622
Rise and shine!

337
00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:29.679
Who wants to go
on a road trip?


338
00:18:29.757 --> 00:18:32.279
Me! I'm gonna bring
Dolly, and Buttercup...


339
00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.281
and Forky, and...

340
00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:36.624
Forky? Where are you?

341
00:18:36.694 --> 00:18:38.140
He's gotta be
here somewhere.


342
00:18:38.176 --> 00:18:39.143
Forky?

343
00:18:39.846 --> 00:18:41.076
Forky!

344
00:18:41.154 --> 00:18:43.580
Come on. Let's eat some
breakfast and hit the road!


345
00:18:43.681 --> 00:18:45.348
Let's go, Forky!

346
00:18:49.657 --> 00:18:51.913
Whoa. He's quite
a handful, Woody.


347
00:18:51.949 --> 00:18:53.382
You need help with him
on the road trip?


348
00:18:53.418 --> 00:18:56.181
No. No, no. I got it,
I got it.


349
00:18:56.282 --> 00:18:58.149
We'll just be stuck
in an RV.


350
00:18:58.248 --> 00:19:00.114
He can't get far.
I got this.


351
00:19:00.214 --> 00:19:01.182
I got it.

Hey, buddy.

Hey, Buzz.

389
00:21:03.209 --> 00:21:04.264
You doing okay?

390
00:21:04.668 --> 00:21:06.099
I don't know, Buzz.

391
00:21:06.619 --> 00:21:08.630
I know you weren't around
when Andy was little...


392
00:21:09.288 --> 00:21:11.355
but I don't remember it
being this hard.


393
00:21:13.264 --> 00:21:14.846
Want me to take
the next watch?


394
00:21:14.893 --> 00:21:16.099
I'll keep an eye
on Forky.


395
00:21:16.198 --> 00:21:18.064
No, no.
I need to do this.


396
00:21:18.165 --> 00:21:18.994
That little voice
inside me


397
00:21:19.065 --> 00:21:21.732
would never leave me
alone if I gave up.


398
00:21:21.832 --> 00:21:22.998
Huh.

399
00:21:24.098 --> 00:21:25.598
Who do you think it is?

400
00:21:25.853 --> 00:21:26.486
Who?

401
00:21:26.548 --> 00:21:29.498
The voice inside of you.
Who do you think it is?


402
00:21:30.229 --> 00:21:31.564
Uh...

403
00:21:31.664 --> 00:21:32.698
Me.

404
00:21:33.101 --> 00:21:34.601
You know,
my conscience?


405
00:21:36.798 --> 00:21:39.576
That part of you
that tells you things?


406
00:21:39.643 --> 00:21:41.042
What you're
really thinking?


407
00:21:42.034 --> 00:21:43.264
Fascinating.

408
00:21:43.531 --> 00:21:46.321
So, your inner voice
advises you.


409
00:21:46.399 --> 00:21:47.499
What?

410
00:21:49.376 --> 00:21:51.386
<i>It's a secret
mission in uncharted space.</i>


411
00:21:51.448 --> 00:21:52.482
<i>Let's go.</i>

412
00:21:56.277 --> 00:21:57.410
Where's Forky?

413
00:21:58.649 --> 00:22:00.180
Oh, no!
Forky!


414
00:22:01.091 --> 00:22:02.230
Forky!

415
00:22:02.499 --> 00:22:03.849
I am not a toy!

416
00:22:03.934 --> 00:22:04.869
I'm a spork.

417
00:22:04.923 --> 00:22:05.600
Be quiet!

418
00:22:05.639 --> 00:22:07.364
I was made
for soup, salad...


419
00:22:07.464 --> 00:22:09.873
maybe chili,
and then the trash.


420
00:22:09.975 --> 00:22:11.376
I'm litter!

421
00:22:11.439 --> 00:22:12.458
Freedom!

422
00:22:15.228 --> 00:22:16.819
Hamm, how far
to our next stop?


423
00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:18.805
5.32 miles, give or take.

424
00:22:18.841 --> 00:22:19.776
I can make that.

425
00:22:19.812 --> 00:22:21.184
I'll meet you
at the RV park.


426
00:22:21.261 --> 00:22:23.261
Woody, hold on a minute.
Woody!


427
00:22:41.698 --> 00:22:42.934
Forky!

428
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.531
Forky, where are you?

429
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.099
Forky!

430
00:22:48.512 --> 00:22:49.598
Forky, where are you?

431
00:23:07.884 --> 00:23:10.099
- Carry me?
- No.


432
00:23:10.365 --> 00:23:11.866
Why do I have
to be a toy?


433
00:23:11.952 --> 00:23:12.943
Because you have
Bonnie's name


434
00:23:12.979 --> 00:23:14.780
written on the bottom
of your sticks.


435
00:23:14.858 --> 00:23:15.869
Why do I have
Bonnie's name


436
00:23:15.924 --> 00:23:17.617
written on the bottom
of my sticks?


437
00:23:17.671 --> 00:23:19.139
Because she...

438
00:23:20.775 --> 00:23:24.198
Look, she plays with you
all the time, right?


439
00:23:24.297 --> 00:23:25.658
Ugh. Yes.

440
00:23:25.694 --> 00:23:27.712
And who does she sleep
with every night?


441
00:23:27.748 --> 00:23:29.155
The big white
fluffy thing?


442
00:23:29.224 --> 00:23:30.591
No, not her pillow.

443
00:23:30.847 --> 00:23:31.845
You.

444
00:23:31.881 --> 00:23:34.066
All right, Forky.

445
00:23:34.113 --> 00:23:37.615
You have to understand
how lucky you are right now.


446
00:23:37.923 --> 00:23:39.278
You're Bonnie's toy.

447
00:23:39.364 --> 00:23:41.619
You are going to help
create happy memories...


448
00:23:41.685 --> 00:23:44.305
that will last
for the rest of her life.


449
00:23:44.988 --> 00:23:45.946
Huh? What?

450
00:23:47.593 --> 00:23:50.148
Okay.
Doing it for Bonnie.


451
00:23:50.248 --> 00:23:52.563
Doing this for Bonnie,
you're doing it for Bonnie.


452
00:23:52.657 --> 00:23:55.766
Okay, like it or not,
you are a toy.


453
00:23:55.828 --> 00:23:57.347
Maybe you don't like
being one,


454
00:23:57.447 --> 00:23:58.737
but you are one
nonetheless.


455
00:23:58.815 --> 00:23:59.938
Which means
you are going


456
00:24:00.024 --> 00:24:01.220
to be there for Andy
when he...


457
00:24:01.276 --> 00:24:02.576
Who's Andy?

458
00:24:03.479 --> 00:24:04.547
I mean, Bonnie.

459
00:24:04.648 --> 00:24:06.348
You have to be there
for Bonnie.


460
00:24:06.447 --> 00:24:08.213
That is your job.

461
00:24:08.313 --> 00:24:09.535
Well, what's your job?

462
00:24:09.605 --> 00:24:12.211
Well, right now,
it's to make sure you do yours.


463
00:24:12.282 --> 00:24:13.680
- Carry me?
- No!


464
00:24:19.919 --> 00:24:21.020
Who's Andy?

465
00:24:23.001 --> 00:24:25.148
Andy was my other kid.

466
00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:27.149
You had another kid?

467
00:24:27.248 --> 00:24:28.248
Yeah, yeah.

468
00:24:28.347 --> 00:24:29.815
For a long time.

469
00:24:31.541 --> 00:24:33.634
And it was pretty great.

470
00:24:34.234 --> 00:24:36.180
I was a favorite toy,
actually.


471
00:24:37.536 --> 00:24:39.816
Running the room
was my job.


472
00:24:39.941 --> 00:24:41.109
Keeping all the toys
in place...


473
00:24:41.187 --> 00:24:43.957
So, he thought
Andy's room was a planet?


474
00:24:44.027 --> 00:24:45.893
Wow,
that is messed up.


475
00:24:45.971 --> 00:24:46.505
Right!

476
00:24:46.541 --> 00:24:48.596
That's exactly what I thought
when he first showed up.


477
00:24:48.667 --> 00:24:51.190
Yeah. I mean,
how is that not annoying?


478
00:24:51.272 --> 00:24:53.291
- Thank you!
- Seriously, that is the...


479
00:24:53.458 --> 00:24:55.000
Well, then you
watch 'em grow up


480
00:24:55.075 --> 00:24:57.064
and become a full person.

481
00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:00.480
And then they leave.

482
00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.106
They go off and do things
you'll never see.


483
00:25:05.442 --> 00:25:08.034
Don't get me wrong,
you still feel good about it.


484
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.723
But then somehow
you find yourself,


485
00:25:09.817 --> 00:25:11.208
after all those years...

486
00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:14.606
sitting in a closet
just feeling...


487
00:25:14.683 --> 00:25:15.882
Useless?

488
00:25:17.394 --> 00:25:18.380
Yeah.

489
00:25:18.677 --> 00:25:20.736
Your purpose fulfilled?

490
00:25:20.914 --> 00:25:22.427
Exactly.

491
00:25:22.498 --> 00:25:24.523
Woody, I know
what your problem is.


492
00:25:24.585 --> 00:25:25.295
You do?

493
00:25:25.389 --> 00:25:26.948
You're just like me.

494
00:25:27.133 --> 00:25:28.144
Trash!

495
00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.077
What is it with
you and trash?


496
00:25:30.197 --> 00:25:31.480
- It's warm.
- Ew.


497
00:25:31.581 --> 00:25:32.915
- It's cozy.
- I guess.


498
00:25:33.015 --> 00:25:33.878
And safe!

499
00:25:33.914 --> 00:25:35.760
Like somebody's
whispering in your ear,


500
00:25:35.815 --> 00:25:37.847
"Everything's gonna
be okay."


501
00:25:37.947 --> 00:25:40.023
Forky, that's it.

502
00:25:40.093 --> 00:25:42.899
That's how Bonnie feels
when she's with you.


503
00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:44.547
- She does?
- Yes!


504
00:25:46.871 --> 00:25:48.072
Wait a sec.

505
00:25:49.365 --> 00:25:51.097
- You mean she thinks I'm warm?
- Yep.


506
00:25:51.133 --> 00:25:52.348
- And cozy?
- Uh-huh.


507
00:25:52.448 --> 00:25:54.062
And sometimes
kinda squishy?


508
00:25:54.148 --> 00:25:55.403
Well, that, too. Yes.

509
00:25:55.504 --> 00:25:57.180
I get it now.

510
00:25:57.265 --> 00:25:58.411
I'm Bonnie's trash.

511
00:25:58.447 --> 00:25:59.347
Yes! Wait, what?

512
00:25:59.448 --> 00:26:00.869
I am Bonnie's trash!

513
00:26:00.905 --> 00:26:01.814
No, no, no, not exactly.

514
00:26:01.915 --> 00:26:03.243
She must be feeling
awful without me.


515
00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:04.848
Woody, we got to get
going, she needs me!


516
00:26:04.947 --> 00:26:06.569
- Yeah... Whoa, whoa.
- Hey, Bonnie, I'm coming!


517
00:26:06.631 --> 00:26:07.953
Forky, slow down! Forky!

518
00:26:08.008 --> 00:26:09.518
Bonnie, I'm coming!

519
00:26:09.589 --> 00:26:10.547
Forky!

520
00:26:33.834 --> 00:26:36.156
Forky, look.
Bonnie's right over there.


521
00:26:36.192 --> 00:26:37.581
Hurry!

522
00:26:42.597 --> 00:26:43.798
Whoo!

523
00:26:58.658 --> 00:27:00.160
Huh? Woody?

524
00:27:05.986 --> 00:27:07.187
Bo?

525
00:27:15.641 --> 00:27:16.909
Woody?

526
00:27:21.266 --> 00:27:23.628
Aren't we going to Bonnie?

527
00:27:23.664 --> 00:27:26.286
I know, I know.
But my friend might be in there.


528
00:27:26.419 --> 00:27:27.247
Friend?

529
00:27:27.347 --> 00:27:29.033
Oh, a friend, uh...

530
00:27:29.151 --> 00:27:30.447
Well, a friend is...

531
00:27:30.548 --> 00:27:32.351
Well, a friend is
like you and me.


532
00:27:32.387 --> 00:27:34.159
- Trash?
- Trash, like... Yes.


533
00:27:34.195 --> 00:27:36.171
And I'm very worried
that she might be lost.


534
00:27:36.207 --> 00:27:38.267
But, Woody,
Bonnie's right there.


535
00:27:38.303 --> 00:27:40.664
Yeah, we'll have you back
before she wakes up. Come on.


536
00:27:50.484 --> 00:27:51.718
Bo?

537
00:27:51.982 --> 00:27:53.083
Bo?

538
00:27:54.946 --> 00:27:55.751
Bo?

539
00:27:55.818 --> 00:27:56.919
Bo?

540
00:27:58.446 --> 00:28:01.172
- Bo?
- Bo?


541
00:28:01.211 --> 00:28:02.331
Bo?

542
00:28:02.401 --> 00:28:03.595
Bo.

543
00:28:03.657 --> 00:28:05.534
Bo, Bo, Bo...

544
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:08.909
- Bo?
- Bo?


545
00:28:12.931 --> 00:28:14.231
Can we go back
to Bonnie now?


546
00:28:14.331 --> 00:28:15.564
I don't see your friend.

547
00:28:15.663 --> 00:28:17.130
Yeah, okay.

548
00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:18.557
She's not in here.

549
00:28:18.659 --> 00:28:19.830
Come on, let's go.

550
00:28:31.379 --> 00:28:32.614
Is that Bo?

551
00:28:36.964 --> 00:28:39.564
Uh...
Hey, howdy.


552
00:28:39.664 --> 00:28:40.928
Hey there.

553
00:28:40.964 --> 00:28:41.933
Uh, sorry to
bother you, but...


554
00:28:41.969 --> 00:28:44.931
Why,
you're not a bother at all.


555
00:28:45.305 --> 00:28:47.496
We were just out for
my early morning stroll.


556
00:28:47.532 --> 00:28:48.975
And look...

557
00:28:49.011 --> 00:28:50.461
we met you!

558
00:28:50.497 --> 00:28:51.971
My name is Gabby Gabby.

559
00:28:52.007 --> 00:28:54.536
And this is my
very good friend Benson.


560
00:28:54.572 --> 00:28:56.531
Oh, uh, Woody.
Pleasure to meet you.


561
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:59.881
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Woody. And you are...?


562
00:28:59.917 --> 00:29:00.914
This is Forky.

563
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:01.931
I'm trash.

564
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:03.930
Our kid made him.

565
00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.500
Kid? Toys around here
don't have kids.


566
00:29:06.536 --> 00:29:07.866
Are you two lost?

567
00:29:07.902 --> 00:29:09.612
Lost?
No, no.


568
00:29:09.648 --> 00:29:12.307
But we are looking
for a lost toy.


569
00:29:12.385 --> 00:29:15.265
She's a figurine. Used to be
on that lamp in the window?


570
00:29:15.322 --> 00:29:16.322
Name's Bo Peep?

571
00:29:16.422 --> 00:29:17.318
Bo Peep?

572
00:29:17.354 --> 00:29:19.757
- Oh, yes, I know Bo.
- You do?


573
00:29:19.835 --> 00:29:21.354
Hop on in.
We'll take you to her.


574
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:23.271
Oh, you don't have
to do that.


575
00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:24.596
Well, okay.

576
00:29:26.243 --> 00:29:28.845
Benson, be careful
with our new friends.


577
00:29:30.788 --> 00:29:32.055
Wow, what service.

578
00:29:38.021 --> 00:29:40.171
Uh...
Thank you for your help.


579
00:29:40.207 --> 00:29:41.533
I haven't seen Bo
in years.


580
00:29:41.569 --> 00:29:43.672
May I ask,
when were you made?


581
00:29:43.708 --> 00:29:44.976
Me? Uh...

582
00:29:45.012 --> 00:29:46.691
I'm not sure.
Late '50s?


583
00:29:46.761 --> 00:29:47.759
Me, too!

584
00:29:47.795 --> 00:29:49.992
Gee, I wonder if we were made
in the same factory.


585
00:29:50.086 --> 00:29:51.757
Wouldn't that be something?

586
00:29:51.827 --> 00:29:54.125
I gotta say,
you are in great condition.


587
00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:57.322
Well, I try
to stay active.


588
00:29:57.507 --> 00:29:58.481
And look at that,

589
00:29:58.517 --> 00:30:00.188
you have
a voice box like me.


590
00:30:00.224 --> 00:30:01.889
Benson, show him.

591
00:30:01.988 --> 00:30:04.622
Oh, that's really
not necessary.


592
00:30:08.563 --> 00:30:09.788
<i>I'm Gabby Gabby</i>

593
00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:12.122
<i>and I love you.</i>

594
00:30:12.195 --> 00:30:14.195
Wow, you need
to fix that.


595
00:30:15.061 --> 00:30:16.888
My record works just fine.

596
00:30:16.989 --> 00:30:19.097
It's the voice box
that's broken.


597
00:30:19.183 --> 00:30:20.444
Does yours still work?

598
00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.021
Hey!

599
00:30:21.122 --> 00:30:22.952
<i>There's a snake in my boot!</i>

600
00:30:23.023 --> 00:30:25.206
Listen to that!
Let's see it.


601
00:30:25.242 --> 00:30:26.207
I bet it's the same type.

602
00:30:26.243 --> 00:30:28.682
No, thanks,
mine's sewn inside.


603
00:30:28.752 --> 00:30:30.355
Is Bo around here?
Because we need...


604
00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:33.502
Oh.

605
00:30:33.538 --> 00:30:35.223
The store is about to open.

606
00:30:35.423 --> 00:30:37.442
Don't worry, we'll take you
where no one will see us.


607
00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.171
Oh, no. We can't stay.

608
00:30:39.273 --> 00:30:40.992
Yes, you can.

609
00:30:52.317 --> 00:30:53.305
We gotta go.

610
00:30:53.411 --> 00:30:56.538
You can't leave yet.
You have what I need.


611
00:30:56.677 --> 00:31:00.310
Right inside there.

612
00:31:00.488 --> 00:31:02.133
Returned that lamp
the next day.


613
00:31:02.195 --> 00:31:03.189
You're kidding me!

614
00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:05.135
Mom, can we go
to the park now?


615
00:31:05.205 --> 00:31:06.339
Harmony!

616
00:31:08.806 --> 00:31:10.322
Stop him, please.

617
00:31:20.856 --> 00:31:22.044
What's going on?

618
00:31:23.883 --> 00:31:25.201
Come on! Let's go!

619
00:31:25.237 --> 00:31:27.451
He's coming, he's coming!
I see him!


620
00:31:27.491 --> 00:31:29.289
Forky? We got
to get out of...


621
00:31:29.608 --> 00:31:30.575
Woody!

622
00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.600
<i>I'd like
to join your posse, boys.</i>


623
00:31:39.636 --> 00:31:41.867
<i>But first, I'm gonna sing
a little song.</i>


624
00:31:48.548 --> 00:31:50.409
Grandma, look what I found.

625
00:31:50.445 --> 00:31:52.292
- Can I take it to the park?
- Sure.


626
00:31:52.331 --> 00:31:55.087
Mom, she has enough toys
from the store.


627
00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:58.315
Oh, it's fine.
Nobody buys the toys anyway.


628
00:31:58.393 --> 00:32:00.090
Thanks, Grandma!

629
00:32:02.177 --> 00:32:04.178
<i>Yee-haw!</i>

630
00:32:05.014 --> 00:32:06.534
Mom, can we go
to the carnival?


631
00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.180
We're going
to the park.


632
00:32:08.281 --> 00:32:09.594
Maybe later, sweetie.

633
00:32:16.546 --> 00:32:17.880
Any sign of Woody?

634
00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.214
- I don't see him!
- Shh!


635
00:32:21.379 --> 00:32:23.340
Maybe we should
have gone with the fork.


636
00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:24.446
The spoon is safer.

637
00:32:24.546 --> 00:32:25.780
Mmm.

638
00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.848
Forky?

639
00:32:31.064 --> 00:32:32.231
Where's Forky?

640
00:32:33.129 --> 00:32:34.591
Mom! Dad!

641
00:32:34.653 --> 00:32:35.722
- What's wrong, honey?
- Are you okay?


642
00:32:35.758 --> 00:32:37.658
I can't find Forky!
He's missing!


643
00:32:37.736 --> 00:32:39.585
Oh, Bonnie,
it'll be all right.


644
00:32:39.647 --> 00:32:41.255
I'm sure
he's here somewhere.


645
00:32:41.317 --> 00:32:42.447
You know,
if you don't find him,


646
00:32:42.547 --> 00:32:43.506
you can make a new one.

647
00:32:43.592 --> 00:32:46.215
No! There's only
one Forky!


648
00:32:46.251 --> 00:32:47.047
Uh...

649
00:32:47.148 --> 00:32:48.313
Let's go look outside.

650
00:32:48.414 --> 00:32:50.511
Maybe he fell on
the ground somewhere.


651
00:32:50.547 --> 00:32:52.028
Oh, poor Bonnie.

652
00:32:52.095 --> 00:32:53.061
We're gonna
find him, okay?


653
00:32:53.097 --> 00:32:55.743
We have to find him,
Mom. He needs me.


654
00:32:55.779 --> 00:32:56.812
Woody was right.

655
00:32:56.848 --> 00:32:58.914
We all should have been
safeguarding the utensil.


656
00:32:59.013 --> 00:33:00.080
Why isn't Woody back yet?

657
00:33:00.181 --> 00:33:01.480
Do you think
he's lost?


658
00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.147
- Buzz, what do we do?
- What do we do, Buzz?


659
00:33:03.248 --> 00:33:04.881
Buzz, what do we do?
What do we do, Buzz?


660
00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.595
- What do we do, Buzz? Buzz!
- I, uh...


661
00:33:06.634 --> 00:33:08.048
- Buzz.
- What would Woody do?


662
00:33:08.147 --> 00:33:09.847
Eh, jump out
of a moving vehicle.


663
00:33:09.947 --> 00:33:11.446
What would Woody do?

664
00:33:12.479 --> 00:33:13.847
<i>It's a secret mission</i>

665
00:33:13.948 --> 00:33:15.781
<i>in uncharted space. Let's go!</i>

666
00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.423
I think I have to go.

667
00:33:18.501 --> 00:33:19.813
- Where?
- Where you goin'? Why?


668
00:33:19.849 --> 00:33:20.780
Should we all go?

669
00:33:20.881 --> 00:33:21.479
- Are we going?
- And then what?


670
00:33:21.515 --> 00:33:22.975
<i>No time to explain!
Attack!</i>


671
00:33:23.069 --> 00:33:24.914
No time to explain!

672
00:33:25.014 --> 00:33:25.835
- Oh, no!
- Buzz!


673
00:33:25.871 --> 00:33:28.115
Okay, what is with everyone
jumping out the window?


674
00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.847
Woody and Forky were
last seen on the highway.


675
00:33:38.947 --> 00:33:40.513
But where is the highway?

676
00:33:40.614 --> 00:33:42.717
<i>The slingshot
maneuver is all we've got!</i>


677
00:33:42.795 --> 00:33:45.014
<i>Full speed ahead!</i>

678
00:33:47.282 --> 00:33:48.648
Thanks, inner voice!

679
00:33:55.147 --> 00:33:56.347
Hi-ya!

680
00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:00.538
The highway.

681
00:34:01.238 --> 00:34:02.639
On my way, Woody!

682
00:34:21.104 --> 00:34:22.405
Rad.

683
00:34:23.705 --> 00:34:25.173
Hey! Step right up!

684
00:34:25.272 --> 00:34:25.960
Put your money down!

685
00:34:25.996 --> 00:34:27.097
Get yourself
a real Buzz Lightyear!


686
00:34:27.133 --> 00:34:29.173
Hey! Hey!

687
00:34:34.337 --> 00:34:36.638
Harmony, honey.
Sunscreen.


688
00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:37.939
Okay.

689
00:34:38.038 --> 00:34:40.205
Be right back, Mr. Cowboy.

690
00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:51.344
Okay. Antique store,
antique store...


691
00:34:51.419 --> 00:34:52.554
Oh, that way!

692
00:35:10.529 --> 00:35:12.629
Did you see 'em?
How many are there?


693
00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:15.030
- Whoa, whoa.
- We got a busload of campers!


694
00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:17.264
Here they come!

695
00:35:17.364 --> 00:35:18.630
- Huh?
- Playtime, baby!


696
00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:34.131
Oh, baby!
It's a good day to play, huh?


697
00:35:34.231 --> 00:35:35.596
Am I right?

698
00:35:38.662 --> 00:35:39.663
Huh?

699
00:35:48.462 --> 00:35:51.298
"Hello, Mr. Cowboy.
How are you today?


700
00:35:51.368 --> 00:35:53.664
"Do you like riding horses?"

701
00:36:03.463 --> 00:36:05.363
Wanna play
on the swings?


702
00:36:05.463 --> 00:36:06.564
Wait for me!

703
00:36:07.662 --> 00:36:09.197
Bo?

704
00:36:09.297 --> 00:36:10.429
Come on.

705
00:36:19.663 --> 00:36:20.597
Bo!

706
00:36:20.633 --> 00:36:22.335
Oh, I can't
believe it's you!


707
00:36:22.428 --> 00:36:23.179
Bo Peep!

708
00:36:23.215 --> 00:36:25.298
I never thought
I'd see you again!


709
00:36:30.061 --> 00:36:31.777
- So, which kid is yours?
- Which one is yours?


710
00:36:31.813 --> 00:36:32.920
- None.
- No one.


711
00:36:32.956 --> 00:36:34.927
- Wait, you're a lost toy?
- You're a lost toy?


712
00:36:34.988 --> 00:36:36.655
- That's awful.
- That's great.


713
00:36:36.755 --> 00:36:39.155
- Huh?
- I mean, awfully great...


714
00:36:39.256 --> 00:36:42.123
that you are lost out here.

715
00:36:42.222 --> 00:36:45.388
- Skunk, skunk, skunk!
- Watch out!


716
00:36:45.488 --> 00:36:47.555
Huh?

717
00:36:49.389 --> 00:36:51.155
I told you
not to drive so fast.


718
00:36:51.255 --> 00:36:52.521
You almost ran him over.

719
00:36:54.421 --> 00:36:55.522
Oh, hey, guys!

720
00:36:55.621 --> 00:36:57.122
Whoa! Hold on there!

721
00:36:57.222 --> 00:36:59.122
Okay! I missed you, too.

722
00:36:59.222 --> 00:37:02.122
If it isn't Bobby? Gus?

723
00:37:02.222 --> 00:37:02.895
Uh...

724
00:37:02.973 --> 00:37:04.216
Lefty?

725
00:37:04.279 --> 00:37:05.521
Billy, Goat, and Gruff.

726
00:37:05.622 --> 00:37:07.422
Right! Right! Right!
Sorry, guys.


727
00:37:07.521 --> 00:37:09.388
- Girls.
- Girls! Of course!


728
00:37:10.655 --> 00:37:11.808
All right, all right.

729
00:37:11.878 --> 00:37:14.777
Okay, let's get a look at you.
You need any repairs?


730
00:37:14.862 --> 00:37:16.856
Repairs? No, I'm fine.

731
00:37:16.956 --> 00:37:19.156
Hey! Nice find, girls.

732
00:37:19.256 --> 00:37:20.879
Where did you get
all this stuff?


733
00:37:20.926 --> 00:37:21.721
Here and there.

734
00:37:21.822 --> 00:37:24.547
You know, some kids
play rougher than others...


735
00:37:24.641 --> 00:37:25.978
so I try
to be prepared.


736
00:37:26.014 --> 00:37:27.745
How long have you been
out on your own?


737
00:37:27.781 --> 00:37:29.858
Seven fantastic years!

738
00:37:29.936 --> 00:37:30.563
Seven?

739
00:37:30.599 --> 00:37:33.222
You would not believe
the things I've seen.


740
00:37:33.322 --> 00:37:34.488
Uh, no.

741
00:37:34.588 --> 00:37:35.781
- Gigs.
- Yo!


742
00:37:35.867 --> 00:37:38.156
Come on out.
There's someone I want you to meet.


743
00:37:38.255 --> 00:37:39.489
Be right down.

744
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.093
What's the situation?
We heading out of town or...


745
00:37:46.129 --> 00:37:47.691
Whoa! Who's this?

746
00:37:47.777 --> 00:37:49.580
You remember the rag doll
I told you about?


747
00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.752
- The cowboy?
- Yep!


748
00:37:50.845 --> 00:37:54.780
No way!

749
00:37:54.879 --> 00:37:57.381
- Don't stare.
- I'm totally staring.


750
00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.780
Woody, this is
Giggle McDimples.


751
00:38:00.604 --> 00:38:01.975
Oh, hi, Giggle.

752
00:38:02.053 --> 00:38:04.247
Whoa, you didn't tell me
he was a cop.


753
00:38:04.347 --> 00:38:05.290
Howdy, Sheriff.

754
00:38:05.326 --> 00:38:06.813
Officer Giggle McDimples.

755
00:38:06.913 --> 00:38:08.837
I run Pet Patrol
for Mini-Opolis.


756
00:38:08.916 --> 00:38:10.017
Yeah, search and rescue.

757
00:38:10.072 --> 00:38:11.250
Ants, caterpillars,

758
00:38:11.286 --> 00:38:13.014
- miniature poodles, spiders.
- Hut! Hut! Hut!


759
00:38:13.113 --> 00:38:14.477
Carl! Where you headed?

760
00:38:14.539 --> 00:38:16.513
Combat Carl just heard
there's a birthday party...


761
00:38:16.613 --> 00:38:17.914
at the playground
on Main Street.


762
00:38:18.014 --> 00:38:19.780
Rumor has it
they got two pinatas.


763
00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.268
- That could be 20 to 30 kids.
- Nice!


764
00:38:22.354 --> 00:38:25.446
Oh, yeah! Combat Carl's
gettin' played with!


765
00:38:25.879 --> 00:38:26.748
You guys in?

766
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:29.680
You bet!
Woody, you are gonna love this!


767
00:38:29.779 --> 00:38:31.513
Uh, no,
I can't, sir.


768
00:38:31.612 --> 00:38:33.380
Bo, I need to get
back to my kid.


769
00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.178
- What?
- You got a kid?


770
00:38:35.241 --> 00:38:35.975
Yeah.

771
00:38:36.045 --> 00:38:38.479
Way to beat
the odds, soldier.


772
00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.030
Meet you at the
playground, Peep.


773
00:38:40.109 --> 00:38:42.614
Combat Carl's got
a pinata party to crash.


774
00:38:42.714 --> 00:38:46.036
All right, move out.
Hut! Hut! Hut!


775
00:38:46.072 --> 00:38:48.579
So, you're, uh,
with a kid?


776
00:38:48.679 --> 00:38:49.814
It's not Andy, is it?

777
00:38:49.913 --> 00:38:51.746
No, no, no.
He went off to college.


778
00:38:51.846 --> 00:38:53.714
But he gave us to Bonnie.

779
00:38:53.813 --> 00:38:55.713
- You have a little girl?
- No way!


780
00:38:55.813 --> 00:38:57.447
Yeah, yeah.
It's why I'm out here.


781
00:38:57.547 --> 00:38:58.680
Her other toy is trapped

782
00:38:58.779 --> 00:39:00.014
in this antique store,
and I have to...


783
00:39:00.113 --> 00:39:01.947
Second Chance Antiques?

784
00:39:02.046 --> 00:39:03.412
We know that store.

785
00:39:03.513 --> 00:39:04.871
That's great.
That is great!


786
00:39:04.942 --> 00:39:06.547
If you know the store,
you could really


787
00:39:06.646 --> 00:39:07.770
- help me find him...
- No way.


788
00:39:07.856 --> 00:39:08.788
We wasted years there,

789
00:39:08.824 --> 00:39:10.843
just sitting on the shelf,
collecting dust.


790
00:39:10.879 --> 00:39:12.380
Oh, Bo, that's awful.

791
00:39:12.479 --> 00:39:13.788
But I don't have a choice.

792
00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:15.413
I have to get that toy
from Gabby.


793
00:39:15.512 --> 00:39:17.187
Whoa. Steer clear
of that weirdo.


794
00:39:17.223 --> 00:39:19.464
If I were you, I'd cut
my losses and go home.


795
00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.647
But Bonnie needs him
to get through kindergarten.


796
00:39:21.747 --> 00:39:24.052
Kids lose toys every day.
Bonnie will get over it.


797
00:39:24.122 --> 00:39:25.208
No, no...

798
00:39:25.263 --> 00:39:29.205
You see, Bonnie needs him
just like Molly needed you.


799
00:39:30.482 --> 00:39:32.379
Aw, no. Sorry, girls.

800
00:39:32.479 --> 00:39:33.679
Molly's not here.

801
00:39:33.779 --> 00:39:35.932
Molly? Bo,
I didn't know you had a kid.


802
00:39:35.968 --> 00:39:37.527
That was a long time ago.

803
00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:40.281
Oh, Bo's kid was
something special.


804
00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:41.947
She was the cutest thing...

805
00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:43.981
but so afraid
of the dark.


806
00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.513
It was just a phase.

807
00:39:45.613 --> 00:39:47.108
Oh, you weren't there
in the beginning.


808
00:39:47.144 --> 00:39:48.847
Hearing Molly cry
each night...


809
00:39:48.947 --> 00:39:51.560
it broke every
toy's heart.


810
00:39:51.813 --> 00:39:54.680
And then,
Bo came into the room.


811
00:39:54.904 --> 00:39:58.772
Her lamp was the only thing
that made Molly feel safe.


812
00:39:58.871 --> 00:40:00.734
Mom would let her
keep Bo on all night.


813
00:40:00.788 --> 00:40:02.871
Ha! Who knew you were
such a softy?


814
00:40:02.971 --> 00:40:04.106
And Molly would
fall asleep


815
00:40:04.205 --> 00:40:06.455
with her hand
resting on Bo's feet.


816
00:40:06.534 --> 00:40:08.905
Okay! Okay. I get it.

817
00:40:10.038 --> 00:40:13.538
Bo, my kid really
needs this toy.


818
00:40:13.637 --> 00:40:16.604
Will you help me?
For old times' sake.


819
00:40:18.471 --> 00:40:19.771
All right, all right.

820
00:40:19.872 --> 00:40:21.605
Thank you! Oh!

821
00:40:21.705 --> 00:40:22.839
- Oh, thank you!
- All right.


822
00:40:22.938 --> 00:40:24.871
Guess we're doing this.
Let's ride!


823
00:40:27.238 --> 00:40:30.406
Second Chance Antiques,
and step on it.


824
00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.966
Ow!

825
00:40:51.503 --> 00:40:52.705
Hey, hey!

826
00:40:52.805 --> 00:40:55.038
- Benson, are we finished?
- Ow!


827
00:40:55.138 --> 00:40:56.896
Oh, that feels great!

828
00:40:56.966 --> 00:40:58.572
Look at that!
Good as new.


829
00:40:58.672 --> 00:41:01.477
Yeah. Thank you,
uh, Benson.


830
00:41:02.804 --> 00:41:05.432
Uh, so, um, when's Woody
coming back?


831
00:41:05.521 --> 00:41:07.348
Like I said, soon.

832
00:41:07.384 --> 00:41:08.755
He won't forget
about you.


833
00:41:08.791 --> 00:41:09.655
How do you know?

834
00:41:09.754 --> 00:41:12.073
You have your child's name
written on your feet.


835
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:13.622
Sticks.

836
00:41:13.721 --> 00:41:15.936
That makes you
a very important toy.


837
00:41:16.014 --> 00:41:17.922
That's exactly
what Woody says.


838
00:41:18.022 --> 00:41:19.588
Hmm. Interesting.

839
00:41:19.688 --> 00:41:21.021
Hi, Grandma!
We're back!


840
00:41:21.057 --> 00:41:22.102
She's back.

841
00:41:23.534 --> 00:41:24.902
Who is she?

842
00:41:25.521 --> 00:41:26.588
Harmony.

843
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.833
Wait a second...

844
00:41:27.926 --> 00:41:29.025
she took Woody.

845
00:41:29.111 --> 00:41:30.588
Did she lose him?

846
00:41:30.688 --> 00:41:33.755
No. My Harmony is perfect.

847
00:41:37.385 --> 00:41:39.582
Forky, it's tea time.
It's tea time.


848
00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:41.615
Whoo-hoo!
What is tea time?


849
00:41:41.661 --> 00:41:42.828
Oh, I'll show you.

850
00:41:44.184 --> 00:41:48.077
A little bit of milk,
two lumps of sugar.


851
00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.920
I've been practicing.
How do I look?


852
00:41:57.424 --> 00:41:59.358
Uh... A little higher.

853
00:41:59.529 --> 00:42:01.162
Stick out
your pinky.


854
00:42:01.511 --> 00:42:03.012
Nice!

855
00:42:03.112 --> 00:42:04.712
Mmm! Delicious!

856
00:42:04.922 --> 00:42:06.634
Harmony,
sweetie, I'm leaving.


857
00:42:06.716 --> 00:42:08.015
Come give me a hug.

858
00:42:08.072 --> 00:42:10.443
Bye, Mom.
I love you.


859
00:42:23.244 --> 00:42:25.410
When my voice box is fixed...

860
00:42:26.654 --> 00:42:29.088
I'll finally get my chance.

861
00:42:41.588 --> 00:42:43.921
Now, about our friend Woody.

862
00:42:44.021 --> 00:42:46.799
I wanna know
everything about him.


863
00:42:46.893 --> 00:42:47.801
Oh, yeah, Woody.

864
00:42:47.879 --> 00:42:50.019
I've known that guy
my whole life. Two days!


865
00:42:50.097 --> 00:42:52.397
Hey, did you know that
Bonnie was not his first kid?


866
00:42:52.491 --> 00:42:54.522
He had this other kid, Andy.

867
00:42:54.622 --> 00:42:55.238
And you know what?

868
00:42:55.274 --> 00:42:56.755
I don't think
he's ever gotten over him.


869
00:43:08.722 --> 00:43:10.688
Psst. Hey, Lightyear.

870
00:43:10.787 --> 00:43:12.224
Hey, up here,
Astro-boy.


871
00:43:12.318 --> 00:43:13.788
If you think you can
just show up


872
00:43:13.888 --> 00:43:15.866
and take our
top prize spot...


873
00:43:15.951 --> 00:43:16.922
- you're wrong!
- Dead wrong!


874
00:43:17.022 --> 00:43:18.788
You don't understand.
I'm trying to...


875
00:43:18.888 --> 00:43:20.955
Cheat the system and get
with a kid? Yeah, we know.


876
00:43:21.055 --> 00:43:22.318
No, I need...

877
00:43:22.396 --> 00:43:24.662
A child to shower you
with unconditional love?


878
00:43:24.725 --> 00:43:26.002
Join the club, pal.

879
00:43:26.088 --> 00:43:26.789
Yeah, join the club!

880
00:43:26.889 --> 00:43:28.333
Come on, help me
get outta here.


881
00:43:28.369 --> 00:43:30.395
I'll help you.
With my foot!


882
00:43:30.431 --> 00:43:31.655
Get him.

883
00:43:31.754 --> 00:43:33.519
Get him.

884
00:43:33.555 --> 00:43:34.922
- Bunny, what are you doing?
- Hmm?


885
00:43:35.021 --> 00:43:37.054
I can't reach him.
Help me out here, come on.


886
00:43:37.155 --> 00:43:39.382
Oh, sorry, Ducky. I'm not
a mind reader, you know.


887
00:43:39.452 --> 00:43:41.287
What's not
to understand, hmm?


888
00:43:41.323 --> 00:43:42.334
You gonna make me say it?

889
00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:43.789
What?

890
00:43:43.888 --> 00:43:44.989
With these tiny legs,

891
00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:46.521
I cannot reach
without your help.


892
00:43:46.621 --> 00:43:47.654
Uh-huh. Okay?
This is what


893
00:43:47.754 --> 00:43:48.797
I've been talking about,
Bunny.


894
00:43:48.833 --> 00:43:49.971
You need to work
on paying attention


895
00:43:50.007 --> 00:43:51.442
and your listening skills.

896
00:43:51.478 --> 00:43:52.588
Ha!

897
00:43:52.687 --> 00:43:54.188
How you like that,
cheater? Huh?


898
00:43:54.288 --> 00:43:56.721
Yeah!

899
00:43:56.821 --> 00:44:00.248
Oh, to infinity
and my foot! Boom!


900
00:44:00.706 --> 00:44:02.821
In a galaxy far, far away,
you got kicked in the head!


901
00:44:02.922 --> 00:44:03.567
Boom!

902
00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:05.421
How do I get out of here?

903
00:44:05.522 --> 00:44:06.855
<i>This planet is toxic.</i>

904
00:44:06.954 --> 00:44:08.721
<i>Closing helmet
to conserve oxygen.</i>


905
00:44:08.822 --> 00:44:10.824
In the vacuum of space,
they cannot hear you scream!


906
00:44:10.887 --> 00:44:12.089
Ow!

907
00:44:12.188 --> 00:44:13.189
Let go of me!

908
00:44:13.288 --> 00:44:15.566
Get off of me!

909
00:44:15.905 --> 00:44:17.360
Ooh! So, that's what
gravity feel like.


910
00:44:17.396 --> 00:44:18.298
Yeah, that's it.

911
00:44:18.334 --> 00:44:19.468
Hey, where you going?

912
00:44:20.606 --> 00:44:22.081
You better get
over here, spaceman!


913
00:44:22.143 --> 00:44:23.621
Yeah, put us
back up there!


914
00:44:23.722 --> 00:44:25.687
Bunny, what are you doing?
He's getting away, let's go!


915
00:44:25.787 --> 00:44:26.922
- I'm trying!
- Come on!


916
00:44:29.213 --> 00:44:31.280
Antique store,
here we come!


917
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.146
Bo, why do you ride
around in a skunk?


918
00:44:33.246 --> 00:44:35.346
Whoa! Skunk!

919
00:44:35.447 --> 00:44:36.747
A skunk!

920
00:44:36.847 --> 00:44:38.246
Oh, I get it. Smart.

921
00:44:38.346 --> 00:44:40.146
Corndogs,
corndogs, corndogs!


922
00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.847
Why are you
so bad at driving?


923
00:44:47.946 --> 00:44:49.879
You got six eyes.

924
00:44:49.979 --> 00:44:51.380
Thanks for the landing.

925
00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.747
- Uh...
- Come on, follow me.


926
00:45:00.047 --> 00:45:01.279
- I'm fine.
- His face!


927
00:45:01.379 --> 00:45:02.646
- That's hilarious.
- I'm fine. Don't worry.


928
00:45:02.746 --> 00:45:04.213
Happens all the time.

929
00:45:04.314 --> 00:45:05.414
Tape!

930
00:45:05.513 --> 00:45:06.813
Not a bad hiding spot.

931
00:45:06.913 --> 00:45:08.147
Yeah.
Leave the skunk.


932
00:45:08.247 --> 00:45:09.712
- We'll fix it later.
- 10-4.


933
00:45:09.812 --> 00:45:11.279
This will be more fun.

934
00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:14.147
Let's get you
to that store!


935
00:45:14.287 --> 00:45:16.508
Okay, spill it.
The cowboy, what's the deal?


936
00:45:16.579 --> 00:45:18.013
- There's no deal.
- Uh-huh.


937
00:45:18.114 --> 00:45:20.417
Don't do this to yourself.
Cowboy's got a kid.


938
00:45:20.487 --> 00:45:22.410
- Giggle...
- Trust me. I've been there.


939
00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.779
You know about me and He-Man.
I'm not proud.


940
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.080
Shh! Here he comes!

941
00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:27.880
- Oh, man...
- What?


942
00:45:27.979 --> 00:45:29.179
No, not you.

943
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.514
Second Chance Antiques,
straight ahead.


944
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:32.894
Heavy foot traffic
at the entrance.


945
00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:34.805
Easiest way in is

946
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:36.156
- the roof.
- The roof!


947
00:45:36.346 --> 00:45:38.347
Let's go antiquing.

948
00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.280
Hold on!

949
00:45:43.845 --> 00:45:45.047
Huh?

950
00:45:45.408 --> 00:45:46.476
Whoa!

951
00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:48.051
How did you end up here?

952
00:45:48.214 --> 00:45:49.813
I thought you were given
to a new family.


953
00:45:49.913 --> 00:45:51.014
Oh, you know
how it goes.


954
00:45:51.113 --> 00:45:52.380
Their little girl grew up

955
00:45:52.479 --> 00:45:55.013
and didn't need me anymore,
so...


956
00:45:55.113 --> 00:45:56.491
Oh, I'm sorry, Bo.

957
00:45:56.569 --> 00:45:58.507
Eh, who needs
a kid's room...


958
00:45:58.585 --> 00:46:02.913
when you can have
all of this?


959
00:46:15.247 --> 00:46:16.754
Whatcha looking at,
Sheriff?


960
00:46:16.846 --> 00:46:18.520
What? Oh, uh...

961
00:46:18.571 --> 00:46:20.762
That wasn't...
No, uh, nothing.


962
00:46:20.833 --> 00:46:23.024
I was looking at the store.
Right there.


963
00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:24.926
I was looking
at the antique store.


964
00:46:24.962 --> 00:46:26.879
- Giggle, count us down.
- Five.


965
00:46:26.996 --> 00:46:28.147
- Countdown for what?
- Four.


966
00:46:28.247 --> 00:46:29.536
You want to get to the
store, don't you?


967
00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:30.280
Three. Two. One!

968
00:46:41.845 --> 00:46:43.879
The highway exit
has to be somewhere.


969
00:46:43.979 --> 00:46:45.213
Where is it?

970
00:46:45.313 --> 00:46:47.879
<i>Meteor shower! Look out!</i>

971
00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:49.413
Woody?

972
00:46:49.513 --> 00:46:51.280
Good work, inner voice.

973
00:46:51.378 --> 00:46:53.886
So, how about you?
How's your new kid?


974
00:46:53.956 --> 00:46:56.247
Bonnie?
Oh, she's great.


975
00:46:56.346 --> 00:46:57.462
Jessie is loving it.

976
00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:58.779
Jessie's still with you?

977
00:46:58.879 --> 00:47:00.812
Oh, yeah, the whole gang's
still together.


978
00:47:00.913 --> 00:47:02.821
Well, I mean,
most of us.


979
00:47:04.813 --> 00:47:05.853
What about Rex?

980
00:47:05.955 --> 00:47:08.132
Yeah, yeah, Rex,
Bullseye, Slinky...


981
00:47:08.205 --> 00:47:09.836
- the Potato Heads...
- Buzz?


982
00:47:09.925 --> 00:47:11.259
Yeah, Buzz, too.

983
00:47:11.353 --> 00:47:14.048
I cannot wait to see his face
when he hears that I found...


984
00:47:14.129 --> 00:47:15.962
- Bo Peep?
- Buzz!


985
00:47:16.084 --> 00:47:17.785
- My old moving buddy!
- Buzz?


986
00:47:17.972 --> 00:47:19.038
It's so good to see you!

987
00:47:19.138 --> 00:47:20.372
Woody, it's Bo Peep!

988
00:47:20.471 --> 00:47:22.004
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?


989
00:47:23.338 --> 00:47:24.339
<i>Buzz... Buzz... Buzz...</i>

990
00:47:24.438 --> 00:47:25.904
<i>Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!</i>

991
00:47:26.004 --> 00:47:27.238
- Three years!
- Three years!


992
00:47:27.338 --> 00:47:28.172
That's how long
we've been


993
00:47:28.208 --> 00:47:29.767
hanging up there
waiting for a kid!


994
00:47:29.803 --> 00:47:30.826
Look, I'm sorry
about that.


995
00:47:30.904 --> 00:47:32.805
You ruined our lives.
Shame on you!


996
00:47:32.904 --> 00:47:34.504
Who are these guys?

997
00:47:34.605 --> 00:47:36.372
- Lightyear promised us a kid.
- You did what?


998
00:47:36.471 --> 00:47:38.071
I did not.

999
00:47:38.171 --> 00:47:39.437
- Hey! Wait a minute!
- Eat my plush!


1000
00:47:39.537 --> 00:47:40.904
All right now,
come on, stop it!


1001
00:47:41.005 --> 00:47:42.005
Cut it out now!

1002
00:47:42.104 --> 00:47:43.105
Come on, guys,
break it up.


1003
00:47:43.204 --> 00:47:44.238
Guys, I have a kid!

1004
00:47:44.339 --> 00:47:46.303
You got a kid?

1005
00:47:46.339 --> 00:47:47.608
Like a kid-kid?

1006
00:47:47.644 --> 00:47:50.071
Like a human kid,
not a baby goat?


1007
00:47:50.172 --> 00:47:52.267
Yeah. Now let go of Buzz
and come with me.


1008
00:47:52.361 --> 00:47:53.491
I'll take you to Bonnie.

1009
00:47:53.527 --> 00:47:54.971
- We're gettin' a kid?
- Yes!


1010
00:47:55.071 --> 00:47:56.338
We're gettin' a kid?

1011
00:47:56.438 --> 00:47:58.105
- <i>♪ We're gonna get a kid</i>
- <i>♪ Kid</i>


1012
00:47:58.204 --> 00:47:59.804
- <i>♪ We're getting a kid</i>
- All right, let's go.


1013
00:47:59.905 --> 00:48:00.833
- <i>♪ We gonna get something, oh</i>
- <i>♪ We gonna uh, uh, uh</i>


1014
00:48:00.887 --> 00:48:03.304
- Where's Forky?
- Long story.


1015
00:48:03.404 --> 00:48:06.105
- <i>♪ Kid, we get a kid</i>
- <i>♪ Kid, kid, kid</i>


1016
00:48:06.205 --> 00:48:08.772
- <i>♪ We gonna kid ♪</i>
- <i>♪ We gonna kid, kid ♪</i>


1017
00:48:10.604 --> 00:48:12.504
He's not anywhere.

1018
00:48:12.605 --> 00:48:14.805
Forky's gone.

1019
00:48:14.904 --> 00:48:16.589
Oh, honey,
I'm sorry.


1020
00:48:16.675 --> 00:48:18.971
Okay. Let's look outside
one more time.


1021
00:48:19.072 --> 00:48:21.772
But then we have to
keep driving, okay?


1022
00:48:24.938 --> 00:48:26.239
They're about to leave!

1023
00:48:26.339 --> 00:48:27.538
- Leaving?
- They can't do that!


1024
00:48:27.637 --> 00:48:29.938
The panic is attacking me!

1025
00:48:30.038 --> 00:48:32.037
- Hey! Watch it, buddy!
- What do we do?


1026
00:48:32.137 --> 00:48:33.771
- We have to stop them!
- How?


1027
00:48:33.872 --> 00:48:35.972
We could frame Dad for a
crime so he goes to jail.


1028
00:48:36.071 --> 00:48:38.471
Or go back in time and warn
Woody about the future.


1029
00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:40.366
That's crazy.
Time is a flat circle.


1030
00:48:40.436 --> 00:48:41.138
Jessie!

1031
00:48:45.141 --> 00:48:46.541
I'm sorry, Bonnie.

1032
00:48:46.611 --> 00:48:47.479
We looked everywhere.

1033
00:48:47.515 --> 00:48:48.872
But we need
to get going now, okay?


1034
00:48:48.908 --> 00:48:50.355
Can we please leave
a note for Forky...


1035
00:48:50.391 --> 00:48:52.008
so he knows
where we're going?


1036
00:48:52.044 --> 00:48:54.105
He has to go to kindergarten.

1037
00:48:54.204 --> 00:48:55.838
Huh?

1038
00:48:57.105 --> 00:48:59.437
Are you kidding me?
I can't...


1039
00:48:59.844 --> 00:49:02.805
Everything is going perfect...
I just bought it.


1040
00:49:02.905 --> 00:49:04.964
Okay! Daddy's
going to use some words.


1041
00:49:05.066 --> 00:49:06.619
How about we go
to the carnival?


1042
00:49:06.705 --> 00:49:09.238
Or maybe check out
some of those shops in town?


1043
00:49:10.281 --> 00:49:11.724
What did you do?

1044
00:49:11.788 --> 00:49:15.121
We're not going anywhere.
If you get my point.


1045
00:49:15.222 --> 00:49:16.155
- Brilliant!
- That was genius!


1046
00:49:16.254 --> 00:49:17.220
Nice work, Jessie!

1047
00:49:17.256 --> 00:49:20.388
I'm sure Buzz and Woody are
on their way back right now.


1048
00:49:22.553 --> 00:49:23.621
Whoa!

1049
00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.987
Forky is in there?

1050
00:49:26.088 --> 00:49:26.763
Yeah.

1051
00:49:26.817 --> 00:49:28.293
Now, hold on.
I have a question.


1052
00:49:28.379 --> 00:49:31.099
Who will Bonnie love more?
Ducky or me? Say me.


1053
00:49:31.177 --> 00:49:32.214
- No, say Ducky. Ducky.
- Bunny. Bunny.


1054
00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:33.879
Okay, guys.
Playtime is over.


1055
00:49:33.915 --> 00:49:35.255
You have to
follow my lead.


1056
00:49:35.354 --> 00:49:38.254
We stay together, we stay quiet.
Are we clear?


1057
00:49:38.355 --> 00:49:40.188
Absolutely.
Lead the way.


1058
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.997
- Are you kidding me?
- Move over.


1059
00:50:03.082 --> 00:50:04.498
- You move over.
- Quit pushing me.


1060
00:50:04.569 --> 00:50:05.621
- Stop.
- Shh!


1061
00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:08.099
Oh, my maker!
That sheep has three heads!


1062
00:50:08.135 --> 00:50:08.853
No, no, no!

1063
00:50:08.953 --> 00:50:11.525
What? All six eyes
just looked into my soul.


1064
00:50:11.561 --> 00:50:12.828
Gonna have nightmares.

1065
00:50:17.487 --> 00:50:21.022
That's most likely where
your Forky is being kept.


1066
00:50:21.122 --> 00:50:22.289
All right,
this isn't so bad.


1067
00:50:22.389 --> 00:50:24.354
We just can't be seen
by the dummies.


1068
00:50:24.453 --> 00:50:25.803
Not just the dummies.

1069
00:50:25.881 --> 00:50:29.389
Her cabinet is surrounded
by a moat of exposed aisle.


1070
00:50:29.488 --> 00:50:31.955
Where Dragon roams.

1071
00:50:32.715 --> 00:50:34.138
- We can handle a cat.
- No.


1072
00:50:34.199 --> 00:50:35.499
Not this one.

1073
00:50:39.369 --> 00:50:42.088
Is that how we look
on the inside?


1074
00:50:42.188 --> 00:50:44.158
- There's so much...
- fluff.


1075
00:50:44.244 --> 00:50:45.717
So, how do you propose
we get up there?


1076
00:50:45.787 --> 00:50:47.845
We could go straight across.

1077
00:50:47.931 --> 00:50:49.713
How?
That's quite a jump.


1078
00:50:49.749 --> 00:50:51.751
We know the perfect toy
to help.


1079
00:50:51.787 --> 00:50:52.954
Oh, Bonnie, check it out.

1080
00:50:53.054 --> 00:50:55.121
- Look at all this cool stuff.
- Bonnie?


1081
00:50:55.222 --> 00:50:56.691
We gotta get
Forky now!


1082
00:50:56.727 --> 00:50:58.085
Woody, don't...

1083
00:50:58.121 --> 00:50:59.423
- Stick to the plan.
- 10-4.


1084
00:50:59.459 --> 00:51:01.393
- Follow me.
- Roger that.


1085
00:51:06.721 --> 00:51:09.088
Woody just sits in the closet?
With no playtime?


1086
00:51:09.188 --> 00:51:11.363
Yeah, he told me himself,
he's useless.


1087
00:51:11.441 --> 00:51:12.525
That's awful.

1088
00:51:12.603 --> 00:51:14.588
Such pretty hair...

1089
00:51:14.687 --> 00:51:15.987
What are you doing?

1090
00:51:16.087 --> 00:51:17.121
You need to stick
to the plan.


1091
00:51:17.222 --> 00:51:18.660
But it's Bonnie.
She's right...


1092
00:51:18.738 --> 00:51:20.488
Can we go
to the carnival, too?


1093
00:51:20.587 --> 00:51:21.521
...there.

1094
00:51:21.621 --> 00:51:23.488
Come on. Stay quiet.

1095
00:51:23.588 --> 00:51:25.255
You better hope
the dummies didn't...


1096
00:51:29.054 --> 00:51:30.321
Whoa!

1097
00:52:03.494 --> 00:52:05.129
My sheep!

1098
00:52:12.587 --> 00:52:14.780
What did I say?
I lead. You follow.


1099
00:52:14.928 --> 00:52:16.528
Bo, I'm so sorry. Really.

1100
00:52:16.591 --> 00:52:17.666
Just tell me how to help.

1101
00:52:17.702 --> 00:52:18.718
You really wanna help?

1102
00:52:18.804 --> 00:52:21.397
Then stay out of my way.
I'm getting my sheep back.


1103
00:52:21.495 --> 00:52:22.496
What about the others?

1104
00:52:22.595 --> 00:52:24.362
Giggle knows what to do.

1105
00:52:26.928 --> 00:52:29.296
- Here you go.
- That's our objective.


1106
00:52:29.397 --> 00:52:31.330
We have to get that key.

1107
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:32.795
It's the only way
inside the cabinet.


1108
00:52:32.895 --> 00:52:34.262
You can't be serious.

1109
00:52:34.363 --> 00:52:35.663
How are we supposed
to do that?


1110
00:52:35.763 --> 00:52:36.753
Okay.

1111
00:52:36.823 --> 00:52:38.297
You know what,
leave that to us.


1112
00:52:38.397 --> 00:52:39.563
We know exactly
what to do.


1113
00:52:39.663 --> 00:52:40.430
Mmm-hmm.

1114
00:52:42.662 --> 00:52:43.329
Aw.

1115
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:45.463
Where did you
two come from?


1116
00:52:45.563 --> 00:52:47.696
The keys! Give 'em up now!
Where are they?


1117
00:52:47.795 --> 00:52:50.096
Give us the keys!
Give us the keys!


1118
00:52:50.197 --> 00:52:51.263
Well, we're not doing that.

1119
00:52:51.362 --> 00:52:52.563
Yeah, yeah, I agree,
too visible.


1120
00:52:52.663 --> 00:52:53.830
It's a good point.
Something more subtle.


1121
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:55.605
Ooh, what about "Winner,
winner, chicken dinner"?


1122
00:52:55.676 --> 00:52:56.529
Yes.

1123
00:53:02.561 --> 00:53:05.030
The keys! Give 'em up now!
Where are they?


1124
00:53:05.066 --> 00:53:07.263
- Uh... you're kidding.
- Really?


1125
00:53:07.363 --> 00:53:08.863
Okay, okay.
You just...


1126
00:53:08.962 --> 00:53:10.113
All right. Well...

1127
00:53:10.149 --> 00:53:12.329
Oh, what about the old
"Plush Rush"?


1128
00:53:12.429 --> 00:53:13.463
There you go!

1129
00:53:26.353 --> 00:53:28.826
- Argh. Where is this going?
- Shh! Don't interrupt.


1130
00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:45.262
- Okay, right?
- Uh-huh?


1131
00:53:45.363 --> 00:53:47.396
Not gonna happen.
N-O.


1132
00:53:47.496 --> 00:53:49.263
Okay, do you want
the key or not?


1133
00:53:49.362 --> 00:53:50.429
What is
wrong with you?


1134
00:53:50.529 --> 00:53:51.285
What is wrong with...?

1135
00:53:51.321 --> 00:53:53.563
We just gave you
three brilliant ideas.


1136
00:53:53.662 --> 00:53:54.883
It's one thing
to say no.


1137
00:53:54.969 --> 00:53:56.829
It's another to offer
a reason...


1138
00:53:56.929 --> 00:53:58.662
How do we get that key?

1139
00:54:04.629 --> 00:54:06.263
You're kidding!

1140
00:54:06.361 --> 00:54:07.628
Really?

1141
00:54:07.729 --> 00:54:08.796
Woody's back?

1142
00:54:08.895 --> 00:54:10.062
Woody's back?

1143
00:54:10.098 --> 00:54:12.013
And you're sure it's
Bo Peep who's with him?


1144
00:54:13.495 --> 00:54:14.528
Thank you, Benson.

1145
00:54:14.628 --> 00:54:16.362
Make sure the others
are ready.


1146
00:54:17.828 --> 00:54:19.130
Woody's back!

1147
00:54:19.229 --> 00:54:21.362
I'm coming, Bonnie!

1148
00:54:22.163 --> 00:54:23.263
Bonnie.

1149
00:54:23.362 --> 00:54:25.297
First, we must prepare
for his arrival.


1150
00:54:25.396 --> 00:54:26.070
Prepare?

1151
00:54:26.148 --> 00:54:28.023
Have you ever played
hide-and-seek?


1152
00:54:28.117 --> 00:54:30.224
No. But it sounds complicated.

1153
00:54:30.326 --> 00:54:31.262
Oh, it's easy.

1154
00:54:31.361 --> 00:54:32.628
- I'll teach you, okay?
- Okay.


1155
00:54:32.728 --> 00:54:34.759
The first thing
you do is...


1156
00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:36.688
one of us finds
a place to hide...


1157
00:54:36.759 --> 00:54:37.278
Scary.

1158
00:54:37.314 --> 00:54:39.249
...while
the other one counts to ten...


1159
00:54:39.325 --> 00:54:41.053
then tries to find them.

1160
00:54:59.013 --> 00:55:00.396
- What are we doing?
- Shh!


1161
00:55:00.588 --> 00:55:03.488
Just stand there
and be quiet!


1162
00:55:08.262 --> 00:55:10.129
I'll do the talking.

1163
00:55:11.361 --> 00:55:13.129
Hi, Tinny!

1164
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:14.796
Aw, nice to
see you, too.


1165
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:18.130
Yeah, he's with me.

1166
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:19.695
My friend?
No, no, no.


1167
00:55:19.795 --> 00:55:21.529
He's my accessory.

1168
00:55:21.628 --> 00:55:23.462
- Hey, guys.
- Bo!


1169
00:55:23.563 --> 00:55:25.629
Long time no see.

1170
00:55:25.729 --> 00:55:27.400
Couldn't take it
out there, huh?


1171
00:55:27.447 --> 00:55:29.032
Hey, Doug.
Saw your better half


1172
00:55:29.068 --> 00:55:30.230
at the front
of the store.


1173
00:55:30.329 --> 00:55:32.296
Yeah, you mess with the cat,
you get the claws.


1174
00:55:32.396 --> 00:55:33.362
Bo came back!

1175
00:55:33.462 --> 00:55:34.663
Magic 8
-Ball was right!

1176
00:55:34.762 --> 00:55:36.897
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- What are you doing here?


1177
00:55:36.959 --> 00:55:39.131
I thought the store
had no return policy!


1178
00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:40.283
Bo, help me out.

1179
00:55:40.384 --> 00:55:41.871
I need a battery.

1180
00:55:41.965 --> 00:55:44.499
<i>We got to get
this wagon train a-movin'!</i>


1181
00:55:44.585 --> 00:55:46.110
- Agreed.
- Help, help, help.


1182
00:55:46.146 --> 00:55:47.085
Cheater.

1183
00:55:47.156 --> 00:55:48.326
Have you seen Duke?

1184
00:55:48.362 --> 00:55:49.663
He's in the back.

1185
00:55:57.995 --> 00:55:59.863
Look who jumped

1186
00:55:59.963 --> 00:56:01.491
and landed back
into my life.


1187
00:56:01.577 --> 00:56:03.595
- Hi, Duke!
- Who's the cowboy?


1188
00:56:03.696 --> 00:56:05.544
Duke, meet Woody.
Woody, meet...


1189
00:56:05.622 --> 00:56:08.309
Duke Caboom.
Canada's greatest stuntman.


1190
00:56:08.345 --> 00:56:10.595
Oh, yeah!

1191
00:56:11.561 --> 00:56:12.629
- Yes!
- Huh?


1192
00:56:12.729 --> 00:56:14.162
He's posing.

1193
00:56:14.895 --> 00:56:15.919
Duke?

1194
00:56:16.005 --> 00:56:17.963
- Duke, we need to...
- Hold on. One more.


1195
00:56:18.062 --> 00:56:20.529
Oh, yeah!
What brings you back, Peep?


1196
00:56:20.628 --> 00:56:21.796
We need your help.

1197
00:56:21.895 --> 00:56:24.862
Gabby Gabby has his toy
and my sheep.


1198
00:56:24.963 --> 00:56:28.696
No. Billy, Goat, and Gruff?
Those are my girls.


1199
00:56:28.796 --> 00:56:30.110
What were you doing
getting tangled up


1200
00:56:30.146 --> 00:56:31.795
with Gabby Gabby?
You know better.


1201
00:56:31.896 --> 00:56:34.307
Yeah, some toy thought
it would be a good idea...


1202
00:56:34.369 --> 00:56:35.662
to wander into the aisle.

1203
00:56:35.762 --> 00:56:37.096
That doesn't make any sense.

1204
00:56:37.196 --> 00:56:38.260
It doesn't, does it?

1205
00:56:38.338 --> 00:56:40.795
Everybody knows the best route
is behind the shelves.


1206
00:56:40.896 --> 00:56:43.029
That would have been
a better route, wouldn't it?


1207
00:56:43.128 --> 00:56:45.130
Wow, this toy sounds like
a complete idiot.


1208
00:56:45.229 --> 00:56:46.796
He does!

1209
00:56:46.896 --> 00:56:49.162
Wait, are you that toy?

1210
00:56:49.263 --> 00:56:50.896
So, here's the plan.

1211
00:56:50.995 --> 00:56:53.528
We need to jump over the
aisle to Gabby's cabinet.


1212
00:56:53.628 --> 00:56:56.396
- And you are the toy to do it.
- No.


1213
00:56:56.496 --> 00:56:57.356
- Duke.
- Nope.


1214
00:56:57.392 --> 00:56:58.829
- Duke? Duke?
- Nuh-uh. No way!


1215
00:56:58.929 --> 00:57:00.562
- Duke. Duke!
- Pass. Negative.


1216
00:57:00.661 --> 00:57:01.589
- Duke.
- Rejected.


1217
00:57:01.625 --> 00:57:03.826
Oh, please, Mr. Caboom,
this is really important.


1218
00:57:03.862 --> 00:57:04.963
My kid...

1219
00:57:05.062 --> 00:57:05.962
You have a kid?

1220
00:57:06.063 --> 00:57:07.629
Uh...

1221
00:57:07.728 --> 00:57:10.429
Hey, Duke, show us some more
poses, what do you say?


1222
00:57:10.529 --> 00:57:12.562
- I had a kid.
- Oh, no.


1223
00:57:12.661 --> 00:57:13.963
Rejean.

1224
00:57:14.063 --> 00:57:17.863
Rejean was so excited when
he got me after Christmas.


1225
00:57:17.963 --> 00:57:21.728
<i>It was the happiest Boxing Day
of my life.</i>


1226
00:57:21.828 --> 00:57:23.095
<i>That's Duke Caboom,</i>

1227
00:57:23.195 --> 00:57:25.862
<i>riding the amazing
Caboom stunt cycle!</i>


1228
00:57:25.962 --> 00:57:27.628
<i>Caboom!</i>

1229
00:57:27.728 --> 00:57:31.062
<i>I was ready to finally
do what I was made to do.</i>


1230
00:57:31.163 --> 00:57:32.496
<i>Caboom!</i>

1231
00:57:32.596 --> 00:57:34.430
<i>But when Rejean realized
I couldn't jump</i>


1232
00:57:34.529 --> 00:57:36.397
<i>as far as the toy
in the commercial...</i>


1233
00:57:37.399 --> 00:57:40.561
It's a commercial!
It's not real!


1234
00:57:40.662 --> 00:57:42.096
Rejean threw me away!

1235
00:57:42.196 --> 00:57:43.398
It's not fair!

1236
00:57:43.492 --> 00:57:45.561
Why, Rejean? Why?

1237
00:57:46.928 --> 00:57:50.429
Okay, okay.
Calm down, Duke.


1238
00:57:50.529 --> 00:57:52.496
That was a long time ago.

1239
00:57:52.596 --> 00:57:54.062
Right now,
we need the only toy


1240
00:57:54.162 --> 00:57:57.117
who can crash us
onto Gabby's cabinet.


1241
00:57:57.211 --> 00:57:57.962
Crash?

1242
00:57:58.062 --> 00:57:58.877
Crash?

1243
00:57:58.939 --> 00:58:01.190
Any Duke Caboom toy
can land...


1244
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:05.096
but you are the only one
that can crash the way you do.


1245
00:58:05.196 --> 00:58:06.696
- I am?
- Yes!


1246
00:58:06.796 --> 00:58:08.996
Forget Rejean.
Forget your commercial.


1247
00:58:09.096 --> 00:58:11.596
Be the Duke
you are right now...


1248
00:58:11.695 --> 00:58:14.828
the one who jumps
and crashes!


1249
00:58:17.195 --> 00:58:22.628
Be who I am right now.

1250
00:58:22.729 --> 00:58:24.929
Who's the Canuck
with all the luck?


1251
00:58:25.661 --> 00:58:26.593
Caboom?

1252
00:58:26.679 --> 00:58:28.795
Who's the greatest
of the Great White North?


1253
00:58:28.895 --> 00:58:29.515
Caboom!

1254
00:58:29.586 --> 00:58:31.510
Who's the most
spectacular daredevil


1255
00:58:31.546 --> 00:58:32.995
Canada has ever seen?

1256
00:58:33.096 --> 00:58:34.762
Duke Caboom!

1257
00:58:34.862 --> 00:58:36.095
Can you do the jump?

1258
00:58:36.196 --> 00:58:38.163
Yes, I Canada!

1259
00:58:40.129 --> 00:58:41.829
Uh-huh.

1260
00:58:41.929 --> 00:58:44.429
- We've got our ride.
- Yes!


1261
00:58:44.528 --> 00:58:45.962
<i>Yee-haw!</i>

1262
00:58:46.595 --> 00:58:47.662
Yo, Bo!

1263
00:58:47.762 --> 00:58:49.963
Gigs! You made it!

1264
00:58:50.113 --> 00:58:51.180
Good work!

1265
00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:52.745
How'd you get it?

1266
00:58:52.845 --> 00:58:54.812
How do we get that key?

1267
00:59:00.144 --> 00:59:02.094
- It was hard.
- Very difficult.


1268
00:59:02.164 --> 00:59:03.750
- Barely made it out alive.
- Yeah.


1269
00:59:03.828 --> 00:59:04.712
So, you're welcome.

1270
00:59:04.811 --> 00:59:07.611
Okay. Let's do this.

1271
00:59:07.712 --> 00:59:09.478
Let me wrap that up for you.

1272
00:59:09.578 --> 00:59:12.234
Don't want anything to happen
to it on the way home.


1273
00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:14.745
Good. That sale
buys us some time.


1274
00:59:15.555 --> 00:59:17.682
Wait for it.

1275
00:59:19.145 --> 00:59:20.946
All right, let's go!

1276
01:00:02.144 --> 01:00:04.611
So, how long
were you in here?


1277
01:00:04.711 --> 01:00:06.445
I don't know.
Couple years.


1278
01:00:06.546 --> 01:00:09.546
I didn't wanna sit on a shelf
waiting for my life to happen.


1279
01:00:09.645 --> 01:00:11.007
So, I left.

1280
01:00:11.063 --> 01:00:12.105
Wow.

1281
01:00:12.183 --> 01:00:14.645
You've handled this lost toy
life better than I could.


1282
01:00:14.745 --> 01:00:16.526
Aw, Sheriff.

1283
01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:18.310
You're selling
yourself short.


1284
01:00:20.205 --> 01:00:22.905
I think you'd make
a great lost toy.


1285
01:00:23.845 --> 01:00:25.012
You really don't think

1286
01:00:25.112 --> 01:00:27.351
you'll ever be in
a kid's room again, huh?


1287
01:00:27.425 --> 01:00:28.337
Nope.

1288
01:00:28.408 --> 01:00:29.642
And now with the carnival
traveling through,


1289
01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:31.041
it's our chance
to hop a ride...


1290
01:00:31.077 --> 01:00:33.372
- and leave town.
- You're leaving?


1291
01:00:33.408 --> 01:00:34.244
Sure am.

1292
01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:36.702
You ever think about getting
out there, seeing the world?


1293
01:00:36.791 --> 01:00:38.395
Without a kid?

1294
01:00:38.431 --> 01:00:41.186
No. You can't teach
this old toy new tricks.


1295
01:00:41.249 --> 01:00:44.043
You'd be surprised.

1296
01:00:44.145 --> 01:00:48.024
So, how'd you end up in this
store in the first place?


1297
01:00:48.094 --> 01:00:50.441
Well, I saw your lamp
in the window...


1298
01:00:50.495 --> 01:00:54.314
and I thought maybe
you were inside...


1299
01:00:54.361 --> 01:00:56.178
and so I, uh...

1300
01:00:59.955 --> 01:01:01.055
Wow.

1301
01:01:02.211 --> 01:01:03.878
Yeah.

1302
01:01:03.979 --> 01:01:05.413
Will you look at that?

1303
01:01:06.935 --> 01:01:10.069
This is the only part
of the store I ever liked.


1304
01:01:17.811 --> 01:01:21.178
That's gonna be quite a
jump for you and Duke.


1305
01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:23.912
For me?

1306
01:01:28.078 --> 01:01:29.901
Didn't I tell you?
You're going with him.


1307
01:01:29.995 --> 01:01:30.946
I am?

1308
01:01:31.812 --> 01:01:32.912
Let's caboom.

1309
01:01:33.012 --> 01:01:34.678
It'll be fine,
Duke's the best.


1310
01:01:34.778 --> 01:01:36.212
Yeah, at crashing.

1311
01:01:40.311 --> 01:01:41.645
And now!

1312
01:01:43.878 --> 01:01:44.878
Go!

1313
01:01:44.978 --> 01:01:45.912
Whoa!

1314
01:01:53.412 --> 01:01:55.213
Huh? Rejean.

1315
01:01:55.312 --> 01:01:58.045
<i>It's a commercial.
It's not real!</i>


1316
01:01:58.146 --> 01:02:00.646
I can't do this!
I'm sorry, Rejean!


1317
01:02:00.745 --> 01:02:02.179
No, no, no!

1318
01:02:10.912 --> 01:02:12.946
What's new, pussycat?

1319
01:02:23.477 --> 01:02:25.045
- Forky?
- Girls?


1320
01:02:25.145 --> 01:02:26.968
Forky, where are you?

1321
01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.786
You're never
gonna find me.


1322
01:02:28.886 --> 01:02:30.853
Forky?

1323
01:02:30.953 --> 01:02:33.278
Woody!
How'd you find me?


1324
01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:35.021
- Bo, I found him!
- Hi.


1325
01:02:35.121 --> 01:02:38.036
Wait, it's an actual fork?

1326
01:02:38.114 --> 01:02:39.407
Bo! Bo! Bo!

1327
01:02:39.471 --> 01:02:41.171
Buzz!
The dummies are gone!


1328
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:43.303
What?
Where'd they go?


1329
01:02:45.537 --> 01:02:46.324
Okay, we can go now!

1330
01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.170
- No. I need to find my girls.
- Hello, Woody.


1331
01:02:49.271 --> 01:02:50.204
Hi, Bo.

1332
01:02:50.303 --> 01:02:51.427
- Where are my sheep?
- Yeah!


1333
01:02:51.497 --> 01:02:53.103
Look! Woody found me!

1334
01:02:53.204 --> 01:02:55.270
- Take the bunny!
- I'm too cute to die!


1335
01:02:57.337 --> 01:02:59.004
- Hi-ya!
- Oh, no, no!


1336
01:02:59.103 --> 01:03:00.438
Woody!

1337
01:03:00.536 --> 01:03:03.471
- I just wanna talk.
- Yeah, with my voice box!


1338
01:03:04.902 --> 01:03:06.237
Pull!

1339
01:03:06.337 --> 01:03:07.770
Whoa!

1340
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:10.370
<i>You're my favorite deputy.</i>

1341
01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:13.527
<i>Somebody's poisoned
the water hole.</i>


1342
01:03:13.605 --> 01:03:15.138
<i>I'd like to join your posse.</i>

1343
01:03:15.238 --> 01:03:17.438
<i>Reach for the sky!</i>

1344
01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:30.404
Girls!

1345
01:03:30.503 --> 01:03:32.003
Drop it.

1346
01:03:35.537 --> 01:03:37.138
No! No! Forky!

1347
01:03:37.237 --> 01:03:39.170
- We've gotta go!
- Wait!


1348
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:40.971
Forky!

1349
01:03:43.404 --> 01:03:44.404
Woody!

1350
01:03:57.903 --> 01:03:58.971
Bonnie's backpack?

1351
01:04:02.269 --> 01:04:03.337
Ahh!

1352
01:04:06.136 --> 01:04:07.469
Giggle!

1353
01:04:09.271 --> 01:04:11.071
Don't let Woody leave!

1354
01:04:13.869 --> 01:04:15.036
Grab on!

1355
01:04:19.502 --> 01:04:21.223
Duke, get us out of here!

1356
01:04:21.301 --> 01:04:22.238
<i>Oui!</i>

1357
01:04:23.103 --> 01:04:24.936
Here, kitty, kitty!

1358
01:04:25.037 --> 01:04:26.837
Wait! We don't have Forky!

1359
01:04:26.936 --> 01:04:28.436
Woody!

1360
01:04:32.036 --> 01:04:33.203
Forky!

1361
01:04:52.536 --> 01:04:54.037
Is everyone okay?

1362
01:04:57.371 --> 01:04:59.770
Shh. It's okay.

1363
01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:01.803
Shh. It's okay.

1364
01:05:01.904 --> 01:05:04.037
Bunny? Bunny?

1365
01:05:04.136 --> 01:05:07.436
Bunny!
No, no, no, no.


1366
01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:11.303
No, no, no, no.

1367
01:05:11.403 --> 01:05:13.537
- Oh, Bunny!
- It's gonna be okay.


1368
01:05:13.637 --> 01:05:14.455
Forky's still in there.

1369
01:05:14.491 --> 01:05:16.204
If we hurry, we can get him
before they lock him up.


1370
01:05:16.303 --> 01:05:17.689
You want us
to go back in there?


1371
01:05:17.725 --> 01:05:19.036
We barely
got out alive.


1372
01:05:19.137 --> 01:05:20.112
Woody, it's better
if we wait.


1373
01:05:20.148 --> 01:05:22.303
No, no, no. There's no time.
We can easily get back inside.


1374
01:05:22.374 --> 01:05:23.059
But I saw Bonnie's...

1375
01:05:23.137 --> 01:05:24.361
By my count, there were
only four dummies.


1376
01:05:24.397 --> 01:05:25.137
But the backpack...

1377
01:05:25.236 --> 01:05:26.403
We outnumber them.
So we have the advantage.


1378
01:05:26.502 --> 01:05:28.190
Woody, look at us!

1379
01:05:31.136 --> 01:05:33.836
Nobody is with you.
It's over, okay?


1380
01:05:33.936 --> 01:05:36.450
No. No, no, no. We are wasting time.
We can do this.


1381
01:05:36.486 --> 01:05:38.362
- Come on, Pull-string.
- It's not worth it.


1382
01:05:38.398 --> 01:05:39.791
Yeah, yes,
listen to her!


1383
01:05:39.845 --> 01:05:41.398
- Nobody wants this!
- I do!


1384
01:05:41.434 --> 01:05:42.770
- Why?
- Because!


1385
01:05:42.806 --> 01:05:44.437
- Why?
- Just because!


1386
01:05:44.537 --> 01:05:45.271
Why?

1387
01:05:45.369 --> 01:05:47.591
Because it's all
I have left to do!


1388
01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:51.403
I don't have anything else.

1389
01:05:52.909 --> 01:05:54.441
So, the rest of us
don't count?


1390
01:05:55.610 --> 01:05:57.578
That's not what I meant.

1391
01:05:57.679 --> 01:05:59.112
Bonnie needs Forky.

1392
01:05:59.212 --> 01:06:01.719
No. You need Bonnie!

1393
01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:03.078
Open your eyes, Woody.

1394
01:06:03.179 --> 01:06:05.184
There's plenty of kids
out there.


1395
01:06:05.254 --> 01:06:09.246
It can't be just about the
one you're still clinging to.


1396
01:06:09.345 --> 01:06:11.245
It's called loyalty.

1397
01:06:11.345 --> 01:06:13.663
Something a lost toy
wouldn't understand.


1398
01:06:21.212 --> 01:06:23.377
I'm not the one who's lost.

1399
01:06:24.945 --> 01:06:26.313
Let's get out of here.

1400
01:06:26.411 --> 01:06:28.911
We've got a carnival
that leaves in the morning.


1401
01:06:29.012 --> 01:06:30.412
Come on.

1402
01:06:30.512 --> 01:06:31.612
Mmm-hmm.

1403
01:06:31.712 --> 01:06:33.079
We'll find our own kid.

1404
01:06:33.178 --> 01:06:34.511
You're crazy.

1405
01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:38.601
Bo!

1406
01:06:38.664 --> 01:06:41.611
Bye, Woody.
Good luck with Bonnie.


1407
01:06:47.494 --> 01:06:51.096
Woody, you did
all you could.


1408
01:06:51.196 --> 01:06:52.906
Time to go home.

1409
01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:54.009
No.

1410
01:06:54.164 --> 01:06:54.860
Woody.

1411
01:06:54.939 --> 01:06:56.783
I don't leave
toys behind, Buzz.


1412
01:06:56.819 --> 01:06:58.096
Yeah, but, Woody,
you're actually leaving...


1413
01:06:58.196 --> 01:07:00.196
Not now. Not ever.

1414
01:07:01.694 --> 01:07:04.362
And he left me behind.

1415
01:07:04.462 --> 01:07:06.316
What now, inner voice?

1416
01:07:06.352 --> 01:07:08.261
<i>Mission
accomplished. Return to base.</i>


1417
01:07:08.355 --> 01:07:10.633
Go back to the RV?
What about Woody?


1418
01:07:10.695 --> 01:07:12.329
<i>We're going home,
space ranger.</i>


1419
01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:13.729
<i>Fall back, this planet...</i>

1420
01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:14.809
<i>Retreat! There's too...</i>

1421
01:07:14.845 --> 01:07:16.929
<i>Go! Time to fly! Exit the...
Back... Run...</i>


1422
01:07:17.039 --> 01:07:18.762
<i>Get out!
Returning to Star Command.</i>


1423
01:07:18.862 --> 01:07:21.195
Okay. Okay.

1424
01:07:22.762 --> 01:07:25.527
Thanks a lot, inner voice.

1425
01:07:25.627 --> 01:07:29.328
Harmony, honey, help Grandma
close up for the night.


1426
01:07:29.428 --> 01:07:32.372
Okay. Then can we
go to the carnival?


1427
01:07:32.463 --> 01:07:33.596
Sure.

1428
01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:40.430
- Ahhh!
- Hello, Woody.


1429
01:07:41.795 --> 01:07:43.186
I knew you'd be back.

1430
01:07:44.378 --> 01:07:45.879
You don't know me.

1431
01:07:45.978 --> 01:07:47.711
But I do.

1432
01:07:47.811 --> 01:07:51.478
You were left in the
closet, feeling useless...


1433
01:07:51.578 --> 01:07:53.578
wondering if you'll
ever get played with.


1434
01:07:53.678 --> 01:07:55.578
I'm not leaving
without Forky.


1435
01:07:55.678 --> 01:07:57.777
Can we agree
on just one thing?


1436
01:07:58.488 --> 01:07:59.267
What?

1437
01:07:59.338 --> 01:08:01.445
That being there for a child

1438
01:08:01.546 --> 01:08:04.844
is the most noble thing
a toy can do.


1439
01:08:06.378 --> 01:08:07.578
Okay.

1440
01:08:09.644 --> 01:08:13.246
I was defective
right out of the box.


1441
01:08:13.346 --> 01:08:16.686
I can only imagine what it
must have been like for you.


1442
01:08:17.743 --> 01:08:21.311
All that time you
spent with Andy...


1443
01:08:21.412 --> 01:08:25.445
riding a bike with him
for the first time...


1444
01:08:25.546 --> 01:08:29.146
comforting him
when he skinned his knee...


1445
01:08:29.245 --> 01:08:32.245
proudly watching him
grow up.


1446
01:08:32.345 --> 01:08:35.479
And then you got a second
chance with Bonnie...


1447
01:08:35.577 --> 01:08:38.378
giving her comfort when
she's scared at school...


1448
01:08:38.478 --> 01:08:41.812
helping her when
she needs it most.


1449
01:08:41.911 --> 01:08:45.777
You've been there through
all their ups and downs.


1450
01:08:47.653 --> 01:08:49.221
Please.

1451
01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:50.553
Be honest with me.

1452
01:08:52.543 --> 01:08:55.478
Was it as wonderful
as it sounds?


1453
01:08:59.277 --> 01:09:00.444
It was.

1454
01:09:03.811 --> 01:09:08.379
All I want is a chance for
just one of those moments.


1455
01:09:10.378 --> 01:09:14.512
I'd give anything to be
loved the way you have.


1456
01:09:20.525 --> 01:09:22.057
Just leave me Forky.

1457
01:09:23.477 --> 01:09:25.411
Bonnie needs him.

1458
01:09:26.811 --> 01:09:28.578
Of course.

1459
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:42.378
The flat tire is fixed!

1460
01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:44.379
Come on, Woody, hurry up.

1461
01:09:44.477 --> 01:09:46.644
Where is he?

1462
01:09:46.744 --> 01:09:48.577
- Buzz!
- Buzz!


1463
01:09:48.678 --> 01:09:50.246
- Where's Woody?
- And Forky?


1464
01:09:50.346 --> 01:09:51.246
We have a situation.

1465
01:09:51.324 --> 01:09:53.142
They need to be extracted
from the antique store.


1466
01:09:53.228 --> 01:09:54.329
How do we do that?

1467
01:09:54.431 --> 01:09:56.370
Okay, let's
make sure we have everything.


1468
01:09:56.445 --> 01:09:58.245
Finally.

1469
01:09:58.346 --> 01:09:59.578
It's okay.
Any minute now...


1470
01:09:59.677 --> 01:10:01.911
Bonnie will notice
her backpack is missing.


1471
01:10:02.012 --> 01:10:04.138
She'll realize she left it
at the antique store...


1472
01:10:04.209 --> 01:10:06.069
and we'll head back
in there.


1473
01:10:06.132 --> 01:10:07.760
Okay.
Looks like we have everything.


1474
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:09.340
- You good, Bonnie?
- Yup.


1475
01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:10.778
Great. Let's get out of here.

1476
01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.812
Okay, genius,
what do we do now?


1477
01:10:13.912 --> 01:10:14.950
Hmm.

1478
01:10:15.051 --> 01:10:16.212
<i>Scanning perimeter.</i>

1479
01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:17.145
<i>Laser at full power!</i>

1480
01:10:17.223 --> 01:10:19.380
- Buzz, what are you doing?
- I'm thinking.


1481
01:10:19.435 --> 01:10:21.146
Honey, will you
please shut that toy off?


1482
01:10:21.245 --> 01:10:22.151
Yeah, I got it.

1483
01:10:22.187 --> 01:10:24.246
<i>Attack!
Meteor shower! Look out!</i>


1484
01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:26.922
<i>It's a secret mission in
uncharted space! Let's go!</i>


1485
01:10:27.031 --> 01:10:29.435
<i>Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!</i>

1486
01:10:29.552 --> 01:10:30.586
Bonnie, how do you
turn this off?


1487
01:10:30.687 --> 01:10:31.987
<i>Full speed ahead!</i>

1488
01:10:32.086 --> 01:10:33.653
- <i>Open the pod bay doors!</i>
- I don't know.


1489
01:10:33.753 --> 01:10:35.321
<i>It's just you and me now,
cadet.</i>


1490
01:10:35.421 --> 01:10:36.720
<i>A distress signal is coming
from that rocket.</i>


1491
01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:38.321
Just toss it in the drawer.

1492
01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:41.254
<i>To infinity and beyond!</i>

1493
01:10:41.787 --> 01:10:44.076
Uh-oh. Uh, your backpack's in
the antique store! Let's go!


1494
01:10:44.112 --> 01:10:45.919
Oh, no, my backpack!

1495
01:10:46.187 --> 01:10:48.486
I left my backpack
in the antique store!


1496
01:10:48.586 --> 01:10:49.853
You did?

1497
01:10:49.952 --> 01:10:52.987
All right,
let's swing by and get it.


1498
01:10:57.903 --> 01:11:00.770
Ugh! I can't believe
the nerve of that cowboy.


1499
01:11:00.869 --> 01:11:02.403
I mean, who does
he think he is?


1500
01:11:02.503 --> 01:11:03.637
Exactly!

1501
01:11:03.737 --> 01:11:05.536
He was way out of line.

1502
01:11:05.636 --> 01:11:07.404
You did the right thing
leaving him behind.


1503
01:11:08.736 --> 01:11:10.336
- Hey, Lamb Chops?
- Hmm.


1504
01:11:10.436 --> 01:11:12.004
- Coast is clear.
- Oh.


1505
01:11:17.501 --> 01:11:18.537
Head to the middle.

1506
01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:19.835
When the carnival
leaves tomorrow,


1507
01:11:19.871 --> 01:11:21.470
we'll hide right there.

1508
01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:25.159
- Uh, no way!
- Stuff that.


1509
01:11:25.195 --> 01:11:25.896
Awesome.

1510
01:11:25.935 --> 01:11:27.370
Stick with me.
You'll be fine.


1511
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:28.172
- Ready?
- No!


1512
01:11:28.208 --> 01:11:29.153
And another thing,

1513
01:11:29.231 --> 01:11:31.041
- Woody asked you for help.
- On your mark...


1514
01:11:31.077 --> 01:11:32.306
And he
treats you like that?


1515
01:11:32.342 --> 01:11:34.404
- ...get set...
- He only cares about himself.


1516
01:11:34.502 --> 01:11:35.503
No!

1517
01:11:35.602 --> 01:11:36.504
You're wrong.

1518
01:11:36.582 --> 01:11:38.536
Woody's always trying to
do right by his kid.


1519
01:11:38.635 --> 01:11:40.188
By putting
everyone in danger.


1520
01:11:40.251 --> 01:11:42.936
Ugh. That kind of crazy
loyalty just...


1521
01:11:43.037 --> 01:11:44.471
You gotta love him for it.

1522
01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:45.937
Whoa, say what now?

1523
01:11:46.037 --> 01:11:48.403
Hey, hey, hey, Bo!
What's the plan?


1524
01:11:48.481 --> 01:11:49.553
Fill me in here.

1525
01:11:55.069 --> 01:11:56.709
Get in! We're going back.

1526
01:11:56.745 --> 01:11:57.618
We just got here.

1527
01:11:57.654 --> 01:11:59.470
You heard Bo!
We're going back!


1528
01:11:59.569 --> 01:12:01.736
Move your plush!
Let's ride!


1529
01:12:08.469 --> 01:12:10.037
<i>You're my favorite...</i>

1530
01:12:23.737 --> 01:12:24.970
Yay!

1531
01:12:26.535 --> 01:12:28.175
<i>You are my best friend.</i>

1532
01:12:28.245 --> 01:12:29.575
<i>Let's play all day!</i>

1533
01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:31.653
Oh, Benson!
Did you hear that?


1534
01:12:31.689 --> 01:12:33.114
Isn't that lovely?

1535
01:12:33.177 --> 01:12:34.170
<i>Time for tea.</i>

1536
01:12:34.248 --> 01:12:36.337
Oh, thank you, Woody.
Thank you!


1537
01:12:36.435 --> 01:12:37.602
All my dreams

1538
01:12:37.702 --> 01:12:38.902
are coming true
because of you.


1539
01:12:39.003 --> 01:12:40.004
Thank you! Thank you!

1540
01:12:40.104 --> 01:12:41.304
Uh, you're welcome.

1541
01:12:42.503 --> 01:12:44.869
It's time, Benson.

1542
01:12:44.970 --> 01:12:47.835
Goodbye, Forky.
I'm going to miss our talks.


1543
01:12:47.913 --> 01:12:50.516
Me, too.
Good luck, Gabby.


1544
01:12:50.602 --> 01:12:52.436
Thank you,
my little utensil.


1545
01:12:53.536 --> 01:12:56.503
Bye, Gabby!
Goodbye, Benson!


1546
01:12:57.173 --> 01:12:59.435
He is terrifying.

1547
01:13:00.669 --> 01:13:01.970
- Hello.
- Hi.


1548
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:03.337
Bonnie?

1549
01:13:03.435 --> 01:13:04.570
Can I help you
with anything?


1550
01:13:04.670 --> 01:13:05.837
Yeah. We called
about the backpack.


1551
01:13:05.936 --> 01:13:07.869
Oh, yes.
I couldn't find it.


1552
01:13:07.970 --> 01:13:09.235
Feel free to look around.

1553
01:13:09.305 --> 01:13:11.869
Quick! Before she finds it!

1554
01:13:14.370 --> 01:13:16.536
Look! There's Harmony.

1555
01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:21.004
<i>You make me so happy!</i>

1556
01:13:21.104 --> 01:13:22.503
<i>Let's be best friends.</i>

1557
01:13:23.336 --> 01:13:24.903
Oh, this is it!

1558
01:13:25.002 --> 01:13:26.702
We're going home, Forky!

1559
01:13:27.369 --> 01:13:28.535
Huh?

1560
01:13:29.368 --> 01:13:31.836
Forky! Oh!

1561
01:13:32.093 --> 01:13:34.759
No, no, no. Woody, look!
It's really happening!


1562
01:13:40.905 --> 01:13:43.705
<i>I'm Gabby Gabby,
and I love you.</i>


1563
01:13:44.927 --> 01:13:46.860
I'm gonna cry.

1564
01:13:50.885 --> 01:13:52.260
Oh, what have you
got there?


1565
01:13:52.362 --> 01:13:54.853
I found this old doll.

1566
01:13:54.953 --> 01:13:57.187
You can take it
home if you want.


1567
01:13:59.052 --> 01:14:00.120
Nah.

1568
01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:10.552
What happened? Gabby was
supposed to be her toy.


1569
01:14:10.607 --> 01:14:12.086
There's my backpack!

1570
01:14:12.186 --> 01:14:13.502
Mom, it's over here.

1571
01:14:18.518 --> 01:14:19.685
Forky!

1572
01:14:19.785 --> 01:14:21.153
Mom, I found him!

1573
01:14:21.253 --> 01:14:23.153
Oh, there he is!

1574
01:14:23.254 --> 01:14:24.720
Now, please leave him
in there,


1575
01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:26.256
so he doesn't get lost again.

1576
01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:34.853
But what about Gabby?

1577
01:14:36.153 --> 01:14:38.087
Forky, listen to me
very carefully.


1578
01:14:38.186 --> 01:14:39.285
This is important.

1579
01:14:39.387 --> 01:14:42.200
Tell Buzz to get the RV
to the merry-go-round.


1580
01:14:42.262 --> 01:14:42.953
You understand?

1581
01:14:43.052 --> 01:14:45.326
Absolutely.
What is a merry-go-round?


1582
01:14:45.373 --> 01:14:47.920
The spinny ride
with lights and horses.


1583
01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.953
- Oh. You mean a carousel.
- Yes!


1584
01:14:50.053 --> 01:14:52.148
Carousel. Yes!
Meet me at the carousel.


1585
01:14:52.211 --> 01:14:52.952
Got it.

1586
01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:09.053
Gabby! Hey, Gabby!

1587
01:15:09.152 --> 01:15:11.786
You can have
your voice box back.


1588
01:15:13.485 --> 01:15:15.186
I don't need it anymore.

1589
01:15:15.287 --> 01:15:16.586
Oh, yes, you do.

1590
01:15:16.686 --> 01:15:18.325
Harmony wasn't
your only chance, Gabby,


1591
01:15:18.361 --> 01:15:19.715
but we have to hurry.
Come on.


1592
01:15:19.809 --> 01:15:23.273
No. Harmony
was my chance.


1593
01:15:23.752 --> 01:15:26.020
My time's over.

1594
01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.020
Now, please go away.

1595
01:15:39.751 --> 01:15:41.154
You hear that?

1596
01:15:47.751 --> 01:15:49.720
A friend
once told me...


1597
01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:52.187
"There are plenty of kids
out there."


1598
01:15:53.485 --> 01:15:55.986
And one of them
is named Bonnie.


1599
01:15:57.718 --> 01:16:00.153
She's waiting for you,
right now.


1600
01:16:01.619 --> 01:16:03.653
She just doesn't
know it yet.


1601
01:16:05.853 --> 01:16:08.586
What if you're wrong?

1602
01:16:08.646 --> 01:16:12.078
Well, if you sit on a shelf
the rest of your life...


1603
01:16:12.142 --> 01:16:14.209
you'll never find out,
will you?


1604
01:16:17.719 --> 01:16:19.753
He's right.

1605
01:16:19.852 --> 01:16:21.853
I learned that
from the best.


1606
01:16:26.019 --> 01:16:28.153
Come on, Gabby.

1607
01:16:28.254 --> 01:16:29.986
Let's get you to Bonnie.

1608
01:16:36.652 --> 01:16:37.705
The carousel?

1609
01:16:37.791 --> 01:16:40.486
Yeah, it's the spinny ride
with lights and horses.


1610
01:16:40.586 --> 01:16:42.309
Woody said
to meet him there.


1611
01:16:42.403 --> 01:16:44.120
- You gotta be kidding!
- How do we do that?


1612
01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:45.093
Oh! We could, uh...

1613
01:16:45.129 --> 01:16:46.770
We are not
sending Dad to jail.


1614
01:16:46.806 --> 01:16:47.873
You're no fun.

1615
01:16:47.981 --> 01:16:50.899
<i>Left turn in 0.5 miles.</i>

1616
01:16:51.024 --> 01:16:53.980
Wait a second.
I have an idea.


1617
01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:06.137
Skunk!

1618
01:17:06.262 --> 01:17:07.229
Skunk!

1619
01:17:17.585 --> 01:17:20.210
Too many people.
Gonna need an alternate route.


1620
01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.341
Will we make it to
the carousel in time?


1621
01:17:26.035 --> 01:17:28.304
Yes, we Canada!

1622
01:17:28.403 --> 01:17:29.969
What? What is it?

1623
01:17:35.797 --> 01:17:39.065
Recalculating.
Take a right.


1624
01:17:39.142 --> 01:17:40.399
What? A right?

1625
01:17:40.435 --> 01:17:42.036
Right turn ahead.

1626
01:17:42.136 --> 01:17:44.082
Huh. Does
the GPS sound funny to you?


1627
01:17:44.168 --> 01:17:45.945
Honey,
it's fine. Just drive.


1628
01:17:45.981 --> 01:17:47.981
Hmm,
I thought it sounded funny.


1629
01:17:50.768 --> 01:17:51.902
Another right!

1630
01:17:52.003 --> 01:17:53.903
- Right.
- Take another right.


1631
01:17:54.002 --> 01:17:55.702
Huh?
Another right? Really?


1632
01:17:55.803 --> 01:17:56.870
- Turn right!
- Now!


1633
01:17:56.969 --> 01:17:58.236
Turn right!

1634
01:17:59.977 --> 01:18:02.078
- We're headin' back.
- There's the carousel!


1635
01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:04.977
Do you think Woody
will get there in time?


1636
01:18:05.078 --> 01:18:07.821
Nope. Forget it. Never.
No. No way. Declined.


1637
01:18:07.907 --> 01:18:09.652
- No dice. Rejected.
- Duke, Duke, you got this.


1638
01:18:09.699 --> 01:18:11.529
This is the fastest way
to the carousel.


1639
01:18:11.607 --> 01:18:12.878
You made the last jump.

1640
01:18:12.978 --> 01:18:15.063
Yeah, but that was 4 feet.
This is 40!


1641
01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:18.478
Exactly! Duke Caboom
would never repeat a stunt.


1642
01:18:18.524 --> 01:18:20.451
- No. He'd never do that.
- No, no, no.


1643
01:18:20.487 --> 01:18:23.311
He's the toy that went
on to crash 40 feet


1644
01:18:23.411 --> 01:18:25.710
into that target!

1645
01:18:25.810 --> 01:18:27.811
Yeah, he is.

1646
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:29.378
I'm Duke Caboom!

1647
01:18:29.478 --> 01:18:31.312
Oh, man. I can do this!

1648
01:18:31.411 --> 01:18:32.744
Yes, you Canada!

1649
01:18:32.845 --> 01:18:34.213
I can do it
with my eyes closed.


1650
01:18:34.275 --> 01:18:34.950
Yes, you... What?

1651
01:18:34.986 --> 01:18:36.910
- Three, two, one. Go!
- What? No, wait!


1652
01:18:42.743 --> 01:18:44.344
- What is he doing?
- Oh, no.


1653
01:18:55.011 --> 01:18:57.312
This is for you, Rejean.

1654
01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:04.177
Caboom.

1655
01:19:07.429 --> 01:19:08.330
Yes!

1656
01:19:08.366 --> 01:19:09.877
He did it!

1657
01:19:09.913 --> 01:19:10.917
All right, our turn!

1658
01:19:10.982 --> 01:19:13.112
You heard the sheriff.
Let's go.


1659
01:19:19.312 --> 01:19:20.313
Yee-haw!

1660
01:19:23.036 --> 01:19:24.336
Another right!

1661
01:19:24.437 --> 01:19:26.333
Another right?
That's the wrong way.


1662
01:19:26.419 --> 01:19:28.313
- Are you sure?
- Stupid rental.


1663
01:19:28.391 --> 01:19:29.803
- I'm turning us around.
- No!


1664
01:19:29.902 --> 01:19:31.369
- Huh?
- Recalculating.


1665
01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:32.536
Turn right.

1666
01:19:32.635 --> 01:19:35.169
- Must be broken.
- No! No!


1667
01:19:39.235 --> 01:19:40.336
What is happening?

1668
01:19:40.436 --> 01:19:41.803
Honey, what are you doing?
Slow down!


1669
01:19:41.902 --> 01:19:43.270
I can't! I can't!

1670
01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:45.770
- Press the brake. Press it!
- I'm trying.


1671
01:19:52.035 --> 01:19:53.336
Got a visual
on the RV,


1672
01:19:53.436 --> 01:19:55.535
heading southbound.

1673
01:20:00.936 --> 01:20:02.102
Gabby?

1674
01:20:04.469 --> 01:20:05.470
Gabby?

1675
01:20:09.436 --> 01:20:11.070
I think she's lost.

1676
01:20:26.403 --> 01:20:28.003
Are you sure?

1677
01:20:38.902 --> 01:20:40.269
Change of plans.

1678
01:20:45.303 --> 01:20:47.469
<i>Pull over.</i>

1679
01:20:47.568 --> 01:20:49.402
I can't! This is a rental!

1680
01:20:49.502 --> 01:20:51.070
I don't know
what's happening!


1681
01:21:01.535 --> 01:21:03.402
I'm so nervous.

1682
01:21:03.502 --> 01:21:05.836
- What if she doesn't like me?
- Gabby.


1683
01:21:05.935 --> 01:21:07.070
I don't know
if I can do this.


1684
01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:09.836
Gabby, it's just
like you said.


1685
01:21:09.935 --> 01:21:13.169
This is the most noble
thing a toy can do.


1686
01:21:18.101 --> 01:21:19.103
Okay.

1687
01:21:19.165 --> 01:21:22.203
Just edge yourself
a bit into the light.


1688
01:21:25.001 --> 01:21:26.970
Not too far.

1689
01:21:27.069 --> 01:21:28.336
That's it.

1690
01:21:29.501 --> 01:21:32.069
Perfect.

1691
01:21:32.170 --> 01:21:34.202
- Winner, winner...
- Chicken dinner.


1692
01:21:56.303 --> 01:21:58.402
Are you lost, too?

1693
01:22:02.365 --> 01:22:05.315
<i>I'm Gabby Gabby.
Will you be my friend?</i>


1694
01:22:06.218 --> 01:22:07.752
I'll help you.

1695
01:22:14.585 --> 01:22:18.319
Excuse me, can you...
Can you help us?


1696
01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:20.053
Oh, honey,
what's wrong?


1697
01:22:20.153 --> 01:22:21.586
I can't find
my mom and dad.


1698
01:22:21.685 --> 01:22:23.686
It's okay.
I'll help you find them.


1699
01:22:23.785 --> 01:22:25.185
I'm sure they're not far.

1700
01:22:25.285 --> 01:22:26.452
She was right next to us.

1701
01:22:26.552 --> 01:22:28.053
She was right here!

1702
01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:29.586
And I looked
away for one second.


1703
01:22:29.685 --> 01:22:30.785
Mommy!

1704
01:22:38.357 --> 01:22:39.758
I couldn't find you...

1705
01:22:39.857 --> 01:22:41.371
and then I found this doll.

1706
01:22:41.407 --> 01:22:42.407
You did?

1707
01:22:42.585 --> 01:22:44.086
Her name is Gabby Gabby.

1708
01:22:56.318 --> 01:22:59.153
Whoa.
We actually did that.


1709
01:22:59.252 --> 01:23:01.652
Oh, yeah. Yes!

1710
01:23:01.753 --> 01:23:03.586
That was amazing.

1711
01:23:03.685 --> 01:23:06.019
We make a great team, guys.

1712
01:23:07.352 --> 01:23:10.019
<i>Pull over now!</i>

1713
01:23:11.718 --> 01:23:13.420
Almost there.

1714
01:23:14.684 --> 01:23:16.387
- Stop!
- Stop!


1715
01:23:21.253 --> 01:23:23.086
Are we home?

1716
01:23:23.185 --> 01:23:24.552
Huh?

1717
01:23:26.285 --> 01:23:28.986
Sir, will you please
step out of the vehicle?


1718
01:23:29.085 --> 01:23:31.353
Dad's totally going to jail.

1719
01:23:37.768 --> 01:23:39.436
Everyone, topside.
Let's move.


1720
01:23:39.535 --> 01:23:42.535
Forky, I've got a very
important job for you.


1721
01:23:42.635 --> 01:23:44.337
For me?

1722
01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:46.437
Have a good night.

1723
01:23:47.502 --> 01:23:50.969
What the...?

1724
01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:53.003
You've gotta be
kidding me.


1725
01:24:07.534 --> 01:24:08.536
Hey.

1726
01:24:09.768 --> 01:24:12.435
Um... So long, cowboy.

1727
01:24:12.536 --> 01:24:14.269
Happy trails.

1728
01:24:18.135 --> 01:24:23.135
Billy, Goat, Gruff.
Take care of her, girls.


1729
01:24:29.435 --> 01:24:32.136
I'm glad
I got to see you again.


1730
01:24:33.667 --> 01:24:35.269
I... I don't...

1731
01:25:01.801 --> 01:25:03.336
Goodbye, Bo.

1732
01:25:28.135 --> 01:25:30.235
Buzz, I... I...

1733
01:25:32.101 --> 01:25:33.602
She'll be okay.

1734
01:25:36.801 --> 01:25:39.468
Bonnie will be okay.

1735
01:25:45.734 --> 01:25:47.069
You sure?

1736
01:25:47.170 --> 01:25:49.861
Hey. Listen to
your inner voice.


1737
01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:21.195
Bo?

1738
01:26:21.295 --> 01:26:22.394
Is it really her?

1739
01:26:22.494 --> 01:26:24.128
I'll be danged,
it's Bo!


1740
01:26:24.228 --> 01:26:25.594
Jessie.

1741
01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:27.393
Bo!

1742
01:27:00.393 --> 01:27:02.460
Oh!

1743
01:27:28.794 --> 01:27:30.394
So long, Forky.

1744
01:27:32.326 --> 01:27:35.028
Forky?
Who's watching the doors?


1745
01:27:36.561 --> 01:27:39.360
- Go, go, go!
- Oh, boy.


1746
01:27:39.461 --> 01:27:42.229
Oh, my goodness. The awning.
What is going on?


1747
01:28:15.884 --> 01:28:19.651
Does this mean
Woody's a lost toy?


1748
01:28:19.752 --> 01:28:21.119
He's not lost.

1749
01:28:22.019 --> 01:28:23.952
Not anymore.

1750
01:28:25.484 --> 01:28:27.419
To infinity...

1751
01:28:27.884 --> 01:28:30.352
And beyond.

1752
01:29:26.948 --> 01:29:28.716
Yay!

1753
01:29:28.846 --> 01:29:31.147
There goes
another one.


1754
01:29:31.233 --> 01:29:32.885
We're never
getting outta here.


1755
01:29:32.985 --> 01:29:34.113
Psst. Frog legs.

1756
01:29:34.183 --> 01:29:35.451
Up here,
Rainbow Connection.


1757
01:29:35.522 --> 01:29:38.100
You Mr. Toads wanna take
a wild ride with a kid?


1758
01:29:38.202 --> 01:29:39.286
We can make
that happen.


1759
01:29:39.384 --> 01:29:40.618
- You can?
- Really?


1760
01:29:40.718 --> 01:29:42.484
Oh, yeah!
Leave it to us, Jeremiah.


1761
01:29:45.485 --> 01:29:46.986
Aw.

1762
01:30:25.676 --> 01:30:27.345
All right.
Nice job, gang!


1763
01:30:27.443 --> 01:30:28.677
Every prize
with a kid.


1764
01:30:28.776 --> 01:30:30.344
- What's next?
- Leave that to us.


1765
01:30:30.444 --> 01:30:32.111
- We know exactly what to do.
- Mmm-hmm.


1766
01:31:10.010 --> 01:31:11.710
Plush Rush!

1767
01:31:11.810 --> 01:31:13.544
How you like that, huh?

1768
01:31:13.644 --> 01:31:15.510
You got plush-rushed, son!

1769
01:31:15.610 --> 01:31:16.677
Dance!

1770
01:31:17.943 --> 01:31:19.651
Dance! Get those knees up!

1771
01:31:21.944 --> 01:31:24.445
Let's see those
feet move! Whoo!


1772
01:31:35.710 --> 01:31:38.076
Or we can get
more toys to kids.


1773
01:31:38.177 --> 01:31:39.944
Yeah, let's do that.

1774
01:31:41.944 --> 01:31:44.245
Do you really have
laser eyes?


1775
01:31:46.143 --> 01:31:47.144
Yeah.

1776
01:31:48.576 --> 01:31:49.810
Whoa.

1777
01:32:16.542 --> 01:32:18.178
Hi, toys. Bye, toys.

1778
01:32:19.209 --> 01:32:20.676
Jessie's back!

1779
01:32:20.777 --> 01:32:22.509
What's first grade like?
Tell me everything!


1780
01:32:22.610 --> 01:32:23.677
Well, it was...

1781
01:32:23.776 --> 01:32:24.943
How was
"Present and Explain"?


1782
01:32:25.043 --> 01:32:26.450
Uh, you mean "Show and Tell"
there, big guy.


1783
01:32:26.512 --> 01:32:27.956
You see
any kids eat paste?


1784
01:32:28.050 --> 01:32:28.911
Guys, listen!

1785
01:32:29.011 --> 01:32:31.639
Bonnie had a great day
in first grade.


1786
01:32:31.733 --> 01:32:33.676
She even made
a new friend in class.


1787
01:32:33.777 --> 01:32:36.048
Oh, she's already
making friends.


1788
01:32:36.127 --> 01:32:39.077
No, no,
she made a new friend.


1789
01:32:39.176 --> 01:32:41.810
Come on out, it's okay.

1790
01:32:59.909 --> 01:33:03.644
Hi. I'm, uh...
I'm Forky.


1791
01:33:03.744 --> 01:33:05.677
Trash?

1792
01:33:05.777 --> 01:33:09.077
No, no. Toy.
I am a...


1793
01:33:09.176 --> 01:33:11.444
We are all toys.

1794
01:33:11.544 --> 01:33:15.544
Unique,
beautiful toys.


1795
01:33:15.643 --> 01:33:18.943
I will explain everything.

1796
01:33:19.643 --> 01:33:23.810
How am I alive?

1797
01:33:26.043 --> 01:33:28.178
I don't know.
