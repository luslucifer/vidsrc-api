1
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.490
I'd love to drop you off,
but I'm running late to the exhibition.


2
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.570
They'll be offended.

3
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.050
Why are you telling me now, Leyla?

4
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.930
I would have taken my car.
I have an important meeting in an hour.


5
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.410
How will I make it? Look at me.
We left the course in a rush.


6
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.650
Tomorrow is our engagement ceremony,
and you still think about work.


7
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.450
Please, you're hurting me.

8
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.490
Not enough time to go home.
I'll buy a suit on the way.


9
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.010
Don't get too crazy tonight.
Tomorrow will be a long day.


10
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.610
And I'll get jealous.

11
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.250
Taxi!

12
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.170
Follow that taxi! I'll get you!

13
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.970
- I finished my shift.
- Get lost, you pea-brain!


14
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.370
Oh, you're in line together?

15
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.370
Go on, sir. You are in a rush.

16
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.930
- Go on.
- You can go on, madam.


17
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.490
There is room for everyone.
Alright, we can leave.


18
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.490
- Don't push me. There is no room.
- I have to. We got the madam inside.


19
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.930
I'm stuck in a terrible position!

20
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.970
- Don't push me.
- Half of her body is hanging off!


21
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.050
Madam, we are in this together.
Say something, please!


22
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.330
- Please move.
- We were in this together, madam.


23
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.050
- There is no room!
- We were in this together!


24
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.850
You just had to
fit in one more person!

25
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.930
God, please stop!

26
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.610
- Thank you, God!
- Thank you, miss.


27
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.050
Go.

28
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.610
I have a meeting. If it wasn't the case…
Remember my face!


29
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.330
You think I don't have a meeting?
Can't I have a meeting?


30
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.170
Why are you all making me scream?

31
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.330
HOPING FOR GOOD NEWS

32
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.850
Dear brother-in-law,
you can't do what you're not used to.


33
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.930
Right? Who are you to play golf?

34
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.370
I don't like it, either.
Leyla forced me into it.


35
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.410
She doesn't want to be embarrassed
in front of her friends in Monte Carlo.


36
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.210
She says it's the sport
of high society. Jeez!


37
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.890
How is golf a sport?

38
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.050
You spend the day
riding around in a cart.

39
00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.210
- Sure!
- It's ridiculous.


40
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.970
Excuse me.

41
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.770
We'll behave tonight, okay?
There are paparazzi outside.


42
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.170
Dad will make pants out of me
if I mess up.


43
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.330
- He'll shove his leg through me…
- Fine, that's enough. I get it.


44
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.250
I'm here for you as your brother-in-law.

45
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
Don't worry. Just have fun!

46
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.250
You can feel safe in my arms.
I got you tonight.


47
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.690
- I got you!
- Really? Alright then.


48
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.410
Look at him.

49
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.650
He is having fun as if he didn't
ruin my life. I'm freaking out!


50
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.330
It took me two years
to get that producer to read my script.


51
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.650
You animal!

52
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.890
Is he looking at me?
Are you looking at me?


53
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.210
Are you laughing at me?
Is he laughing at me?


54
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.170
What?

55
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.130
Jerk.

56
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.090
You'll see.

57
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.090
- Tequila?
- I know it.


58
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.890
It's for you to
drink on your way out.

59
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.890
Hey! Don't you see?
He is completely drunk.


60
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.410
Don't give him more. Let's leave.

61
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.890
I'm insulted!

62
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.290
I'm bringing it.

63
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.970
A bunch of babies can't teach me
how to drink!


64
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.930
Hey! Niyazi! Are you okay?

65
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.730
How could he be okay? He drank everything.
I told you to stop giving him drinks.


66
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.650
It's okay. I didn't drink much.

67
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.090
But I'm weak-willed,
so I lost myself after my second drink.


68
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.530
- I made it a habit.
- I beg you, get it together.


69
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.570
Or we'll be screwed.
We'll be done for. Please.


70
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.130
Your check.

71
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.890
Don't make me break your heart!

72
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.890
You can't get the check when I'm paying!

73
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.890
Oh, fuck!

74
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.250
Don't get mad, I'll pay for it.
He gets mad when they rip him off.


75
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.610
Holy shit!

76
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.330
He vomited the cucumber whole!

77
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.410
- Come here.
- Gentlemen, let's go.


78
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.450
- You mean us?
- What…


79
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.010
Wait a minute.

80
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.450
Come on!

81
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.490
- Let me go.
- Wait!


82
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.130
- Throw them out!
- Wait a minute, dude!


83
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.690
Niyazi!

84
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.970
- Wait! Let me go!
- Bulut!


85
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.010
- I'm not paying!
- We won't pay!


86
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.970
We won't! Somebody help us!

87
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.090
- Wait!
- Stop, bro!


88
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.490
- Jeez!
- Wait!


89
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.130
Wait a minute! Niyazi!

90
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.730
- Get out!
- Niyazi!


91
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.330
Maybe he has a sensitive stomach!

92
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.410
Just leave! You can go in.

93
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.930
They offended me, Bulut. 
They wronged me.

94
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:20.570
Look at how they treated me,
a 45-year-old man!


95
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.690
Wait, stand tall! 
What are we here for?

96
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.170
It's our place,
and they won't insult us here!


97
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.530
- Bulut, wait!
- Of course, Bulut doesn't wait.


98
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.050
- Stop!
- Don't go. What do we do?


99
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.410
He never stops! 
What kind of a son is he?

100
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.610
He'd be the devil
if he also rebelled against God.


101
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.810
I completely agree, Dad.

102
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.290
Bekir! I'm telling you!
You're about to get it!


103
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.370
Why did you throw your slipper at him?

104
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.330
Yesterday, he split
his brother's head open.


105
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.570
He likes destruction so much that
I wonder if he is a reincarnated pharaoh.


106
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.250
I'm asking crazy questions.

107
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.450
Don't be silly! A pharaoh named Bekir?
They are kids, let them play.


108
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.170
I'm talking about Bulut, not my grandkids.

109
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:16.850
- Oh! Mom!
- My silly boy!


110
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.810
I told him to be careful
until the engagement,


111
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.250
to not get caught to paparazzi.

112
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:27.370
But see? He doesn't understand!

113
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:28.610
Never mind the idiot!

114
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.930
What do we say to the girl's family?
We are nobodies.


115
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:36.490
He doesn't understand he'll marry into
the richest family in the country!


116
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.410
You are done for, Niyazi.

117
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.290
You were supposed to
keep an eye on Bulut.

118
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.090
The girl's dad is calling.
What do I tell him?


119
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.090
- I know what I'll do.
- What?


120
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.770
- I'll go up to that piece of shit…
- Dad!


121
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.450
- Dad, come here!
- Honey!


122
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:12.730
Niyazi!

123
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.290
Niyazi…

124
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.810
Did we sleep on the floor?

125
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.170
You should be ashamed
as the host. My back!


126
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.970
Niyazi, let's call it what it is.
You know what happened?


127
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.890
My sister didn't kick you out.
She took the kids and went to our home.


128
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.090
Why do you stay at my place?
Go to your own home!


129
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:41.050
Do I have to start my days
by seeing your mug?


130
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.210
Bulut.

131
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.690
Don't sit on the stone floor.
It will harm your stones.


132
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:51.250
Don't poop lava
just before your engagement. Come here.


133
00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.210
What happened to your face?

134
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.890
- What?
- You're asking me? You look like shit.


135
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.290
Who else should I ask?
We were together last night.


136
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.810
Is it really bad?

137
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.010
My eye…

138
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:12.410
Phew!

139
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.090
My eye is all messed up. 
And my lips…

140
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:24.090
My teeth are gone! 
They were implants!

141
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:29.010
I paid 2200 euros for them last week!
They fucked me up so bad!


142
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.290
Oh, fuck!

143
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.370
What did we do last night?
Look at the news.


144
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:37.850
What did we do?

145
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:43.650
You flew through the air!
You look like superheroes. Look at you.


146
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.250
I like it too. Good shot.
I wonder who took it.


147
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.530
- He caught the exact moment…
- What moment, man?


148
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.290
What the hell? What did we do?
What happened last night?


149
00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.850
- You couldn't control him.
- My warmest regards.


150
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.690
- Özge, what are you doing here?
- We came here together last night.


151
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.890
Niyazi won't remember it.
Don't you remember either?


152
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.490
Anyway.

153
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:14.010
You need to get changed.
You're so cozy, like it's your own home.


154
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.130
- Özge!
- Wait.


155
00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.650
- What are you doing?
- Come here.


156
00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.490
- Niyazi!
- Sit down and wait.


157
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.170
Don't send her away yet.

158
00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:29.810
Let's find out what happened
and decide afterwards.


159
00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.730
I can't lose my teeth.
I have four more installments, please.


160
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:35.930
- I'm begging…
- Stop!


161
00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:37.090
It's so bad.

162
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.610
Go and wash up. 
Breakfast is almost ready.

163
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:42.490
We'll talk at breakfast.

164
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:49.130
- What were you doing there last night?
- What? I brought you home in one piece.


165
00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:53.050
You need to thank me
instead of questioning me.


166
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.010
- Give me the salt.
- Bulut!


167
00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:57.250
Jeez.

168
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:02.290
Don't you remember
all the stuff that happened last night?


169
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:03.810
- That's incredible.
- Bulut!


170
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.850
I only saw the end of it.
I don't know much.


171
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.850
I saw a fight and you were there.

172
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.010
You were getting beat up,
so I decided to help.


173
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:16.090
Ask her!

174
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.890
- What happened to his teeth?
- What happened?


175
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.810
Are you okay, Bulut?

176
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:28.810
Hey, did you do this to my brother-in-law?

177
00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.890
Look, you need to leave
before making a bigger scene.


178
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.370
Alright then.

179
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.650
Hey! You…

180
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:50.490
My tooth is stuck to your head, sir.
What a way to pull teeth!


181
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.370
I have four more installments.

182
00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.930
I swear I will beat you up.

183
00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:00.730
You hear what the jerk did?

184
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:04.530
His head took my front teeth out
like a pair of pincers.


185
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:08.930
Sorry for asking, but would you
recognize him if you saw him?


186
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:13.850
Stop, Niyazi. I'll pay for your teeth.
Now you know what happened.


187
00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:19.170
It's not about the money,
it's about my principles. You understand?


188
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.050
- Someone is at the door.
- Excuse me.


189
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.490
Why are you still here?

190
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:30.490
You weren't able to talk last night,
so I had to wait for the morning.


191
00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.610
Yes, cut to the chase.
It's funny when you talk about helping me.


192
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.770
We know each other. 
No need to lie.

193
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:40.410
Just tell me whatever it is and leave.

194
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:43.850
Fine.

195
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:48.690
I did my best
to be able to talk like two adults.


196
00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.970
If that's what you want, okay.

197
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:53.490
I'm pregnant.

198
00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:57.490
Congrats. May your baby have
a long and wonderful life.


199
00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:58.730
You can go now.

200
00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.450
You're the father, you idiot.

201
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.770
What? We broke up two years ago.

202
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.210
How did you get pregnant?
Using an extension cord?


203
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.570
Niyazi, get the door!

204
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:14.410
Remember when we ran into each other
in a fish restaurant three months ago?


205
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:15.490
No.

206
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.450
Like you don't remember last night.
Well, we went to my place.


207
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:23.210
Don't worry, nothing happened last night.
But that night…


208
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:27.210
We'll talk about that.
And take off Leyla's swimsuit.


209
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.650
- Dad?
- "Dad?"


210
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.730
What is this scandal about?
You have disgraced me!


211
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.370
It's a lie. There wasn't a fight.
They are exaggerating.


212
00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:44.130
I just needed you
to not cause a scandal for one day.


213
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:45.810
Just behave for once!

214
00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.370
But you can't live without chaos.

215
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:52.090
Your mom's blood pressure went up
and we rushed to the hospital.


216
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:53.730
She almost died because of you.

217
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:58.530
We didn't even know if you were okay.
We couldn't reach you on the phone.


218
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.170
It was on silent.

219
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.810
- I turned it off now. Back off!
- "Back off"?


220
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:05.490
- Go away!
- Why are you yelling at me?


221
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.450
- Go!
- You're kicking me out too?


222
00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:09.810
- Not at all!
- You freaking…


223
00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:15.570
Bulut.

224
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:20.810
Even the people of Lot
weren't punished by God like this.


225
00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:25.330
What did we do to deserve all this stuff
that happened since yesterday?


226
00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.410
Oh, God…

227
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:32.410
Your dad's slap is tattooed onto my face.
It burns like hell.


228
00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:35.890
It feels like cigarette burns on my cheek.

229
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.730
- Why did he slap you?
- I don't know!


230
00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:42.690
I opened the door
and he said, "Who the hell are you?"


231
00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.410
He couldn't recognize me.

232
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:50.210
He gave me the Ottoman slap
before I could answer.


233
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:52.490
Then, I was in another dimension.

234
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.770
He doesn't know how to control himself.

235
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:59.410
Poor Mr. Kazım. 
I understand you now.

236
00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:03.130
He was a Maroon Beret, you hear me?

237
00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:06.050
And your dad slapped
him so hard one day.

238
00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.970
- My uncle?
- Yes.


239
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.810
He was in disbelief. Why do you think
they are still on bad terms?


240
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.690
Enough about my dad and uncle.
How are you?


241
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:19.130
Can you get up?
We need to leave the hospital now.


242
00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.450
Why? What happened?

243
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.370
Özge!

244
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.210
Your dad broke her nose, right?
I remember.


245
00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.130
You told me.

246
00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.650
Your sister can make me talk.

247
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.050
If she questions me,
I'll tell her everything,


248
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:42.970
even Özge's grand-grandpa's background.
I know who I am. I get drunk and talk.


249
00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:48.090
I'm sure she knows everything.
But let's keep it in the family.


250
00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.770
Leyla will kill me. She called
a million times. If she hears about it…


251
00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.250
She won't cause trouble
on your engagement day.


252
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.610
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

253
00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.850
What about me?

254
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:04.610
I'm sure your sister will blame me
for everything.


255
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.170
Right.

256
00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:09.890
It doesn't feel right.

257
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.690
We brought her to the hospital
and escaped like criminals.


258
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:17.410
Can you visit her after the ceremony?
I can't go myself and I'll be worried.


259
00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:18.610
Fine.

260
00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:23.210
- Hello?
- Who is it?


261
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.010
I'm listening.

262
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:27.050
Right.

263
00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:32.370
You see, we are in a rush.

264
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.770
- What happened?
- We can't drop by.


265
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.730
Could you send somebody…

266
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:42.290
It's nothing.
I just dropped your engagement rings.


267
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.170
They'll bring it to where we are.

268
00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:51.130
Sir, I'll send my location
to your employee and they can come there.


269
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.970
For sure, sir.

270
00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:57.850
Please accept our apologies
for the unfortunate incident yesterday.


271
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.530
Our men didn't recognize Mr. Bulut.

272
00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:04.290
I'm sending my employee
to your location right away.


273
00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:05.610
Absolutely, sir.

274
00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:07.530
My apologies.

275
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.130
My best regards.

276
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.890
BIG ENGAGEMENT TONIGHT

277
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.570
I just said
I wanted to give birth to my child.


278
00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.810
How can I hurt an innocent soul?

279
00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:02.050
What kind of a mother willingly does that?

280
00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:11.050
But Bulut Haydaroğlu and his family
didn't accept it.


281
00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:17.010
They all attacked me
when I said I wanted to keep my baby.


282
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.130
I almost lost my baby
before I could give birth.


283
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.930
It was horrible!

284
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:37.050
What do you think?
Do you like my performance?


285
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:40.890
<i>You should see me
with all the press and cameras around.</i>


286
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:45.090
Bulut, say all the prayers you know.

287
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.450
It's the only way
to get rid of this demon of a woman!


288
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.650
Are you insane? 
What do you want from me?

289
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:53.730
You.

290
00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:58.050
You have two hours to come here.
You are not getting engaged.


291
00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.850
But if you insist on
getting engaged to Leyla,


292
00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.250
now you know what will happen.

293
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.090
<i>It's up to you.</i>

294
00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:12.930
Go inside, son.
Don't run around, okay? Go in.


295
00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.770
- Welcome.
- Welcome.


296
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.930
- Hello.
- Hello.


297
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:23.490
Welcome.

298
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.930
Dear Hülya. Congratulations.

299
00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:28.330
How are you?

300
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.930
I feel amazing. 
How wouldn't I?

301
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:36.170
People can't even find normal husbands,
and my daughter found a flying one.


302
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:41.170
See you.

303
00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.370
Look at her face.

304
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.010
Instead of being happy for her daughter's
engagement, she looks tortured.


305
00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.770
Well, she is not wrong.

306
00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.850
Her daughter's getting engaged
to Bulut after all.


307
00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:57.570
Think about the last 24 hours
and put yourself in her shoes.


308
00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:00.650
Shut up and stop annoying me.

309
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.290
You'll incur my wrath now.

310
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.010
- What do you say?
- What?


311
00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:11.050
What do you say? 
What would you do?

312
00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:13.450
Because that nut job
will talk to the press.


313
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.770
What is done is done. 
But Niyazi is right.

314
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.730
It's better to escape from here
than have her talk to the press.


315
00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:23.410
- Or it'll be bad.
- Calm down. Don't worry.


316
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.290
Trust me for once.
Everything is planned out.


317
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.970
First, find out what Özge's problem is.

318
00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:36.450
In a few days, you can claim
you were stressed out and overwhelmed.


319
00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:40.410
Then, you'll make up with Leyla.
No need to worry so much.


320
00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.490
I don't care about
the wedding or whatever.


321
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:19.050
I'm only here because my bootlicking boss
wants me to deliver it personally.


322
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:29.490
Alright, I'm here.

323
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:37.410
- Okay, I found your name. You can go in.
- Thank you, good night.


324
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.450
He is late. He won't make it.

325
00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:42.770
I'm here!

326
00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:45.970
Where have you been?
The ceremony starts in five minutes!


327
00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:47.210
Close the door!

328
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:48.810
I sit here.

329
00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:52.690
You know how I went to Çatalca?

330
00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.810
The police pulled me over
and took my driving license.


331
00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:59.610
What were you doing in Çatalca?
We are in Beykoz!


332
00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:05.610
They almost charged me
for bribing the police, but I took off.


333
00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:09.770
Imagine where you would be
if the police hadn't pulled you over.


334
00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:11.810
I don't know, bro.

335
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:17.090
Okay, I went a bit too far,
but it hit me afterwards.


336
00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:18.450
I'll hit you now…

337
00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:22.370
I opened my eyes and I was in Çatalca.
And I kept driving.


338
00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:24.090
Jeez.

339
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:27.370
Whiskey.

340
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:30.970
Enjoy.

341
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.090
Bravo!

342
00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:09.450
I don't know how we'll do it.
Should we change the plan?


343
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:13.090
You're right. You have an annoying sister.

344
00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:16.370
She'll take my bottle away.

345
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:21.290
You guys go ahead.
I'll finish this quickly and join you.


346
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:24.770
- I've done it before.
- I'm not talking about that!


347
00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:31.050
You need to clean this place, okay?
This is unacceptable.


348
00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:35.690
How will you walk
out of the front door?

349
00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:39.610
I won't use the front door like an idiot.
I'll go through the kitchen.


350
00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:41.090
Check on Niyazi.

351
00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:00.250
Where is he?

352
00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:03.170
Who does he think he is?
Why is he still not here?


353
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:07.970
Niyazi is not around either.
I wonder what they are up to.


354
00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:13.770
- Should we go check on them?
- They'll get suspicious if we go together.


355
00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:16.450
You should sneak out in a few seconds.

356
00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:17.650
Okay.

357
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.410
Go on, run!

358
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:24.730
Oh, God…

359
00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:36.770
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Mr. Niyazi… Jeez!


360
00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.570
Enough with this guy and everything…

361
00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.570
Niyazi! Where have you been?

362
00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:46.210
I conquered the Balkans
under Midhat Pasha's…


363
00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:47.850
Shut up! Give me that.

364
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:50.610
Look at yourself. 
You goddamned fool.

365
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.650
Where is Bulut?
People have been waiting for him.


366
00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:56.810
Don't tell me he is drunk too
or I'll beat you up!


367
00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:01.010
He is getting engaged,
so he must be there.


368
00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:06.250
Tell people not to wait for him.
He can't come today.


369
00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:08.090
You dirty drunkard!

370
00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:09.770
Wanna kiss?

371
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:13.050
What was that?

372
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:17.450
Have a good night.

373
00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:42.890
What happened? What is it?

374
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.410
God! What the hell?

375
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:56.770
Run!

376
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:45.490
Don't take anything
until the prosecutor comes here.


377
00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:49.810
- We found something on CCTV.
- Let's go.


378
00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.810
Hey! Oh, God.

379
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:05.850
Hold it! God!

380
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:10.130
- Don't touch it! Don't!
- Fine!


381
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.410
Who are you?
Why are you in my car? Get out!


382
00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:19.410
- It's you!
- I'm talking to you! Don't you understand?


383
00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.370
You… How do I know you?

384
00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:28.890
- Some awful stuff happened.
- What?


385
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:31.250
Why do I care?

386
00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:34.170
Just get out. I won't call the cops.

387
00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:37.770
I'm running out of time. 
Get out, please.

388
00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.890
Wait. Zoom in.

389
00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.690
Is this that person?

390
00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:46.850
Are you sure?

391
00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:51.010
When I came in, she was covered in blood
and getting off the body.


392
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:54.450
She was two or three meters away from me.
I'm sure it's her.


393
00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:57.810
Keep playing it.

394
00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:04.170
- Wait. Who is this guy?
- That's the groom-to-be, Bulut Haydaroğlu.


395
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:06.970
Weird.

396
00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:12.850
You said some awful stuff happened.

397
00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:18.690
Sorry, but what could be worse
than me running from my engagement?


398
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:20.930
Huh?

399
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:27.570
- Mr. Niyazi?
- Help me. Please, help me!


400
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:33.650
I'll drop you off somewhere central
in a minute.


401
00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.450
I won't call the cops.
Go wherever you want.


402
00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:37.930
Okay? That's it from me.

403
00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:45.170
That's right. Shouldn't you be
at your engagement ceremony?


404
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:49.730
You ran away too?

405
00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.610
What do you mean?

406
00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:58.770
Why did you run away?

407
00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:01.770
Because of murder.

408
00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:04.970
But not a murder I…

409
00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:07.130
Hey! God, help me!

410
00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:10.290
Are you stupid or something?

411
00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:13.290
I earn my money by
the sweat of my brow.

412
00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:17.090
But nobody marries me because
I'm a truck driver. Is it a shameful job?


413
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:20.850
God, help me! What
am I going to do?

414
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:22.890
God!

415
00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:26.410
- God will give you a suitable spouse.
- God willing.


416
00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:55.330
God sent you to me.

417
00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:59.850
No, man. The airbag didn't deploy.
This wouldn't have happened otherwise.


418
00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:01.650
Hey, Ali!

419
00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:06.810
God heard my wishes and slung you here.
What an awesome entrance!


420
00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:11.690
Sir, this is not how God sends people.
It's how God takes people.


421
00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:14.690
Don't you see the car?
I went through the window.


422
00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:18.130
Mr. Ali, can you…
Can we check the car?

423
00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:20.850
Hey, look. Jeez!

424
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:23.290
<i>The cause of the murder is
yet to be determined.</i>


425
00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:28.930
- Look, she is a murderer!
<i>- People need to be cautious.</i>


426
00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.890
<i>That's all for now, Zihni. 
Back to you.</i>

427
00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:37.370
It was raining women, but I got
a murderer with blood on her hands.


428
00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:38.610
I'm so unlucky!

429
00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:43.610
Sir, I went through the window!
Maybe that's how my hands got bloody.


430
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.570
- I'm not a murderer!
- You can tell the police.


431
00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:49.970
Wait. Stay away or I'll show you!

432
00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:52.410
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

433
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:54.410
Dude, call the police.

434
00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:01.970
I'm not feeling good.
Can you all just stop for a second?


435
00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:08.570
I'll kill you all! 
Stay away from her!

436
00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:10.370
Come here!

437
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:15.890
Fatty, what have you done? Huh?

438
00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:17.530
You have a death wish?

439
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:19.810
Huh?

440
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.850
- You have a car?
- Yes.


441
00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:29.930
Throw the keys! 
Throw the keys.

442
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:35.370
Get them, I'm looking.

443
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:42.170
- I'll fuck you all up!
- We will!


444
00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:45.770
We are leaving now.
I'll shoot if you move.


445
00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:47.250
- Is this for a truck?
- Yes.


446
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:48.930
- Which one?
- The orange one.


447
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:52.250
Don't move, I'm on my last nerve!

448
00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:54.330
Come on.

449
00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:57.050
- Where did you find a gun?
- What gun? I'm so scared.


450
00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:00.690
- Jeez!
- That's the orange one. Come on.


451
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:02.570
- Open it.
- Come on.


452
00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:07.370
If you had listened to me,
you would have found out the truth.


453
00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:10.130
I'm not a murderer, 
I didn't kill her.

454
00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:12.490
If you don't believe me,
why did you save me?


455
00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:14.930
To find out what happened, of course.

456
00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:18.210
If you didn't kill her,
why did the police release your name?


457
00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:22.010
Why did the police release your name?
How do I know you didn't kill her?


458
00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:24.810
A normal person wouldn't run away
from his engagement.


459
00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:27.810
- That's irrelevant! Hey!
- Give me a break. Look!


460
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:31.610
None of this would have happened
if you hadn't entered my car.


461
00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:34.690
Let's go to the police
and tell them everything!


462
00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:36.250
Let's tell them we are innocent!

463
00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:39.570
Let's go to the police
and get a life sentence.


464
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.250
They must have a proof
if they released our names.


465
00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:45.290
- They wouldn't believe our innocence.
- They wouldn't?


466
00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:48.690
- Have you seen a murderer admit his crime?
- I've never even seen a murderer!


467
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:51.170
I don't know what they do!

468
00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:54.570
And you think I'm running a drug cartel?

469
00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:56.490
Just think. Use your brain.

470
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:59.130
What can we do? 
Where can we go?

471
00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:02.810
We need to buy some time
and come up with a plan.


472
00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:07.170
And then,
we'll see if the plan works or not.


473
00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:13.810
- You are so cold-blooded. Who are you?
- Look at the road. Look!


474
00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:18.490
I don't want to go through the window
again, because it's becoming a habit.


475
00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:20.970
We'll talk when we
get rid of the truck.

476
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:24.410
Such a professional!
We'll get rid of the truck!


477
00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:27.570
I'm sure the men at the restaurant
already called the police.


478
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:31.410
They must be hot on our tracks.
Use your head.


479
00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:34.970
I can't breathe! 
Open the window!

480
00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:38.810
Fine, there you go!

481
00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:44.450
- Stop using up my oxygen.
- You think about the window in this mess?


482
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:00.330
- Sir?
- Hm?


483
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:01.970
The suspects used a car

484
00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:05.170
rented by Niyazi Kocabaş
from a rent-a-car in Ümraniye.


485
00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:07.810
He escaped from a traffic stop in Çatalca.

486
00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:09.930
- The brother-in-law.
- That's right.


487
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:12.490
- Find him, wherever he is.
- Yes, sir.


488
00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:14.090
Go on.

489
00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:16.610
Is that so, brother-in-law?

490
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:18.970
- Chief Inspector?
- Yes?


491
00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.370
Chief Superintendent wants to see you
and Inspector Uğur.


492
00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:25.170
Okay, Uğur went to the cafeteria.
Go get him.


493
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:26.450
- Sure.
- Go on.


494
00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:30.570
Don't worry, Dear Minister.
We will do everything we can.


495
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:34.890
We'll bring those outlaws to justice
as soon as possible.


496
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:36.130
Yes, sir.

497
00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:39.530
Please send my best regards
to your dear wife.


498
00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:42.850
Hello? Dear Minister?

499
00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:46.250
I shouldn't have cut him off.

500
00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:53.410
What have you done?
Who told you to speak to the press?


501
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:57.810
- Massachute… Mashashutep… Masha…
- Massachusetts.


502
00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:00.450
Whatever! Do you think we are there?

503
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:02.690
Do you think you are FBI agents?

504
00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:06.610
I'm under immense pressure!
The minister comes here tomorrow.


505
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:10.490
He is a young man on his first case.
He got excited and talked to the press.


506
00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:12.050
Sorry, we couldn't stop it.

507
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:17.010
Cevat, I'll nail you to the wall.
Are you kidding me?


508
00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:21.250
What kind of an apology is that?
His first case? You bastard!


509
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:24.050
It's too late now, sir.

510
00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:28.050
Too late? What if they are not murderers?
But you said so to the press.


511
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:32.450
We will all get relocated
to terrible places tomorrow.


512
00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:38.730
My boy with iron balls! This is how
a police officer is supposed to be!


513
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:41.330
I've never seen a cop
like you in my life.

514
00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:43.730
Thank you so much, sir.

515
00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:46.770
But Chief Inspector Cevat is my idol.

516
00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:49.890
I came to the homicide bureau
to work with him.


517
00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:50.810
Shut up.

518
00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:54.410
You hear that, Cevat?
He came here to work with you.


519
00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:58.690
- You are his idol. Did I get it right?
- Yes, sir.


520
00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:01.770
Your idol… Come here.

521
00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:05.370
Fuck your idol!

522
00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:09.450
- You bastard! Come here!
- Sir, what are you doing?


523
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:13.970
- Get the fuck out! You piece of shit!
- Okay.


524
00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:15.650
- Your idol!
- Calm down.


525
00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:17.570
Prick!

526
00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.570
You can't even get out of it!

527
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:30.850
I haven't been in a truck before!
We'll go through the woods.


528
00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:33.650
What? We can reach civilization if…

529
00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:36.650
Sorry, I'm not walking down the road
for everyone to see.


530
00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:40.490
- You wanna build a fire and cook too?
- We can't stay here.


531
00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:42.770
They'll search the woods
if they find a trace.


532
00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:46.450
It's pitch black in there!

533
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:48.610
We're going into the woods?

534
00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.490
What are you looking for?
Did you see something?


535
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:06.570
- Are you scared?
- Me? Scared?


536
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:09.210
I am not scared of the things I see.
I'm just uneasy.


537
00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:14.770
Sure! You let go of the wheel
when I said "murder".


538
00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:18.610
My dear, that's a reflex.
It's an art of war, you wouldn't get it.


539
00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:21.210
Your body reacts when it feels a danger.

540
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:24.450
Please! Jeez.

541
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:27.490
You weren't laughing
in that restaurant, though.


542
00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:30.730
I saved you
from that gang of giants on my own.


543
00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:33.930
As if they were a mechanized division.

544
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:36.450
This is all you did.

545
00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:40.490
- Don't exaggerate it.
- Jeez.


546
00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:44.010
You walk around
like you grew up on that oak!


547
00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:45.570
- What?
- Oak!


548
00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:46.850
That's a pine!

549
00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:49.450
Why do you walk around
like you know this place?


550
00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.970
I swear I'll choke you! 
Stop annoying me.

551
00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:55.770
I'm trying to find the house
I saw on the way.


552
00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:57.610
- We're going there?
- Yes.


553
00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:58.890
- Come on.
- Go on.


554
00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:01.970
I still don't know
why you were at my engagement.


555
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:04.810
Enough with your fucking engagement!

556
00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:14.570
Why not give the
rings to a family member?

557
00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:20.010
- Why did you search for my brother-in-law?
- Oh no, you got me.


558
00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:23.290
- You know, he caused a scene at the club.
- Yeah?


559
00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:25.770
And he puked on me. So, 
I got mad at him.

560
00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:29.130
I decided to kill him
and started following him.


561
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:34.730
But I killed the singer lady I ran into.
Because I'm a psycho.


562
00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:37.690
I can't stop killing.
I always need to kill something.


563
00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:41.650
- Fine.
- You need to think about where we'll stay.


564
00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:45.890
We have been fighting for our lives
trying to get to this house!


565
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:48.650
I thought you had a plan.
Why did we walk here?


566
00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:54.170
This is a covert operation.
You need to shut up. Learn to be quiet.


567
00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:58.810
- Be careful.
- You be careful. Especially you.


568
00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:01.930
What are you doing? 
Walk behind me.

569
00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:17.010
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!


570
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.570
- What are you doing?
- Hush!


571
00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.970
This is why we
got rid of the truck.

572
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:28.050
Probably some poor old guy lives here.

573
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:30.410
Considering his car, he must be tiny.

574
00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:33.250
He won't notice
we took the car until tomorrow.


575
00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:35.770
Meanwhile,
we'll think about where to stay.


576
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:37.930
You fucking…

577
00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:42.650
You need to use your brain a little bit.
Could you start helping me now?


578
00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:47.210
Shut up and let me think.
You run your mouth like a machine gun.


579
00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:50.850
I know some stuff too. I'll help.
You damned know-it-all.


580
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:52.250
Watch it.

581
00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:55.330
How do you know so much stuff?

582
00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:58.330
You can even tell
what the man in the house is like.


583
00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:00.610
I'm actually a scriptwriter,

584
00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:03.130
but I can't do my job
because of people like you.


585
00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:08.130
What is going on here?

586
00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:12.450
Some old guy lives here, huh?
You and your damned job… Sir?


587
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:22.290
Hey!

588
00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:29.610
Where the hell are you?

589
00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:38.970
Did you kill him?

590
00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:44.370
Yeah, sure. And I tied him up
in case he comes back to life.


591
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:45.810
How did you do it?

592
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:49.090
When he hit you, 
I hit him as a reaction.

593
00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:52.210
You didn't just hit him.
You avenged your past.


594
00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:55.010
You got revenge.
Look, he fainted with his eyes open.


595
00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:58.770
I saw a wrench on the front seat.
What was I supposed to do?


596
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:01.530
- You sure he is alive?
- He is.


597
00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:03.890
- Have you checked?
- I have.


598
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:07.890
- Go on, hide him.
- God. Let's go.


599
00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.970
- I found a solution!
- God!


600
00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:22.450
I found it!
He is the only person who can save us!


601
00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:24.450
Why are you shouting?

602
00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:27.010
- Where are we going?
- To my uncle.


603
00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:30.570
Your uncle?
You really think he can save us?


604
00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:31.650
For sure.

605
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:33.650
What is he like?

606
00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:36.810
Bald. Long beard. 
Kind of grumpy.

607
00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:40.890
I'm not asking about what he looks like!

608
00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:45.650
- Is he a judge or prosecutor or something?
- No, it's even better than that.


609
00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:47.890
- He is a Maroon Beret.
- What?


610
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:52.610
- He comes from Maroon Beret in Kastamonu.
- I don't know about that place!


611
00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:55.730
- Beret. Maroon Beret!
- He has a maroon beret? Okay.


612
00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:59.050
- You'll see what he has.
- Hey!


613
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:11.410
You said you haven't
been here in a while.

614
00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:13.730
You sure it's the place? 
It looks empty.

615
00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:17.170
I'm sure.
I never forget the places I visit.


616
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:25.210
What are you doing?
What are you looking for?


617
00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:26.570
Come here.

618
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:29.410
- Climb up.
- I can't.


619
00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:31.770
- Come on.
- Jeez!


620
00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:37.570
We turned into criminals overnight.

621
00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:41.170
We got accused of murder.
We stole a truck and a car.


622
00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:44.490
But breaking and entering? 
It is too much!

623
00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:48.410
I don't need permission
to enter my own uncle's house.


624
00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:52.770
This doesn't count.
But we are certainly improving.


625
00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:57.010
Certainly! I'll start
a criminal organization in a few years.


626
00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:59.330
You'll be the leader.
We have so much to do.


627
00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:02.410
- Stop! Hands in the air!
- Uncle, I'm Bulut.


628
00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:06.330
- Hey!
- Uncle, please! Our hands are in the air!


629
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:10.170
- Hands in the air!
- Our hands are in the air!


630
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:14.090
- Why don't I see it?
- Maybe because it's dark?


631
00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:15.810
- Huh?
- You missed us.


632
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:18.370
You shot an appliance!
We are on the right!


633
00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:20.850
Why did you tell him?
What if he isn't my uncle?


634
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:22.370
You're telling me now?

635
00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:26.370
Please turn on the light
if you are his uncle.


636
00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:29.410
- There will be an accident.
- Don't move!


637
00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:31.770
We are not strangers! Tell him!

638
00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:34.130
- Hopefully.
- Hopefully?


639
00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:37.130
Bulut?

640
00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:44.610
Hey, did you bring your fiancée
to meet me? Good for you.


641
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:46.610
Give me a hug!

642
00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:50.890
He is calling you over. Go!
Why are you smiling?


643
00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:55.290
- What do you mean, smiling?
- My man! Give me a hug!


644
00:44:56.690 --> 00:45:01.690
So, you wanted me to go down with you
and came to me, you jerk.


645
00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:04.010
Is it the fastest it can go?

646
00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:07.610
- There is a problem with the gearbox.
- There is a problem with you, you idiot!


647
00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:11.730
You goddamned idiot.
You were an idiot as a kid too.


648
00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:14.010
We are closely related!

649
00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:16.810
You came to the first address
the police would check!


650
00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:19.690
- You jerk!
- Because you and Dad are on bad terms…


651
00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:25.770
So, you figured the police force
would help us reconcile? You jerk!


652
00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:30.130
Shut up. Don't say a word.
You can't talk until further notice.


653
00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:32.050
- Girl?
- Girl… Yes?


654
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:35.570
I won't ask again.
Are you responsible for the murder?


655
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:39.250
No. It's like I told you.

656
00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:41.290
Tell me again, from the start.

657
00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:43.690
- From the start?
- From the start.


658
00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:51.250
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Mr. Niyazi… Jeez!


659
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:56.290
- Mr. Niyazi?
- Please, help me!


660
00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:02.970
Don't do it! Why
did you do it? Don't!

661
00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:04.730
Oh, no!

662
00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:11.490
It won't stop! 
God, somebody help me!

663
00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:15.090
Call an ambulance!

664
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:19.890
- Stop! Don't move!
- This is how I found her!


665
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:23.810
- Don't! The singer has been stabbed.
- No, it wasn't me.


666
00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:26.450
- Backup to the groom's room.
- She was lying down…


667
00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:29.770
- I didn't know what to do.
- Don't move.


668
00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:31.890
- I applied pressure…
- Stop.


669
00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:37.130
Stop! Wait!

670
00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:01.650
Wow! Holy hell!

671
00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:05.570
- Uncle, will you help us?
- Shut up.


672
00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:08.570
I told you to be quiet
until further notice.


673
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:11.290
Let me think.

674
00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:20.370
Let's find you a safe hiding place first.
We'll figure out the rest.


675
00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:25.930
Guys, we need to keep dancing.
It's an engagement!


676
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:27.970
Sir, here is the brother-in-law.

677
00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:30.050
- Why did you bring him here?
- Why?


678
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:35.130
I told you this wasn't my house
and I didn't want to come here.


679
00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:40.690
My house has a living room
that's four times bigger than this place.


680
00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:42.650
- He is a little drunk.
- A little?


681
00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:45.690
Get him to sober up
and take him to the interrogation room.


682
00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:47.930
- Don't stand around!
- Yes, sir.


683
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:50.410
- That's my photo!
- Come on!


684
00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:53.930
I had my teeth then! 
That's my photo!

685
00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:56.170
- Dammit!
- Sir?


686
00:47:56.250 --> 00:48:00.850
I was told the girl was seen
next to the victim with the murder weapon.


687
00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:05.690
Read this.
Here is what the preliminary autopsy says.


688
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:09.330
The killer threw the knife
from a few meters away?


689
00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:11.410
- Yeah.
- No way.


690
00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:13.690
- She is not Xena!
- Shut up!


691
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:17.650
You're pushing my buttons.

692
00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:04.850
You'll stay here until we figure this out.

693
00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:07.410
You can't leave without my permission.

694
00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:13.130
No phones, no social media,
no communication. Get it?


695
00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:17.450
Doesn't matter for me.
I have nobody to call.


696
00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:23.050
Don't look at me like that.
It's not that bad.


697
00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:25.610
You are no different, either.

698
00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:32.490
Go on, sit down.

699
00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:35.210
I'll buy you some stuff for breakfast.

700
00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:37.810
Also, some clothes.

701
00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:40.890
- What size are you?
- Thirty-eight.


702
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:42.250
Thirty-eight.

703
00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:46.650
I won't ask you. I'll get you
the jerk size if I can find it.


704
00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:48.770
Idiot.

705
00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:56.130
The kitchen…

706
00:49:58.090 --> 00:49:59.970
We should do something.

707
00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:04.610
You dumb cluck!

708
00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:09.250
Why did you believe her
and escape from your engagement?


709
00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:12.450
- Maybe she lied about being pregnant.
- Maybe?


710
00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:17.770
She suggested a paternity test.
She wouldn't risk it if it was a lie.


711
00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:22.690
I don't want to brag, but my nephew is
an exceptional idiot, you know?


712
00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:24.930
I had to.
She was going to talk to the press.


713
00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:27.290
She threatened my whole family.

714
00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:32.450
I'm sure they are worried sick,
especially Leyla.


715
00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:35.330
You shouldn't have escaped
from your engagement.


716
00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:38.530
You are cursed now. 
It's divine justice.

717
00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:42.970
Right, God has cursed me for my sins
and sent you my way.


718
00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:44.410
- Really?
- Right.


719
00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:47.090
- Is that so?
- Hey, stop fighting like cats and dogs.


720
00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:51.730
What is done is done.
It's about your lives now.


721
00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:55.770
If we can't find the murderer,
you'll both get locked up.


722
00:50:55.850 --> 00:51:00.090
- You'll never be released.
- That's worrying.


723
00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:04.090
Should I do some research
about Işıl online?


724
00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:08.130
Maybe she has an enemy
or some debt business.


725
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:10.890
- Or maybe an obsessive fan.
- Okay, good idea.


726
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:14.370
I'll find you a laptop
so that you can work.


727
00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:20.210
And you can just sit there
like a useless jerk.


728
00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:25.730
I can't find anything! 
I'm losing my mind.

729
00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:31.210
<i>- It's clear. Bulut and Müjde are lovers.
- And his engagement…</i>


730
00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:35.170
- What are you doing?
- Getting intel on Işıl.


731
00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:36.370
Lying down?

732
00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:39.930
You didn't infiltrate Pentagon.

733
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:43.370
You're going through
public resources like me.


734
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:49.050
- I'll make coffee. Do you want some?
- Stop. I'll make it.


735
00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:51.970
Getting tired makes you angry.

736
00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:54.930
Blah-blah-blah. 
You are all about show.

737
00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:56.250
No milk.

738
00:52:04.450 --> 00:52:08.690
How is my brother-in-law, Mr. Kazım?
Is he doing okay?


739
00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:10.770
How could he be okay?

740
00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:14.130
If it was any worse,
it would be the doomsday.


741
00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:16.210
He is done for.

742
00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:18.810
He is feeling low.

743
00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:20.610
Niyazi.

744
00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:25.650
I will break you
if you tell anyone about this meeting.


745
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:27.530
I mean it.

746
00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:30.290
I will break you in half. Okay?

747
00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:35.610
I understand, Mr. Kazım.
I don't want to risk my life or anything.


748
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:38.490
Find an excuse to not go home tonight.

749
00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:41.770
- I need you.
- Whatever you need.


750
00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:46.810
I would die for my brother-in-law.
I love him so much!


751
00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:50.330
Niyazi, I love your character.

752
00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:53.290
And I love you…

753
00:52:56.330 --> 00:52:57.330
sir.

754
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:21.130
You are a rich boy,
but you can do everything.


755
00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:23.130
You are a jack-of-all-trades.

756
00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:27.290
You are far better than me.

757
00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:31.890
I'm good at cooking,
but you're good at illegal things.


758
00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:38.010
What an idiot. Jeez.

759
00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:44.170
Uncle, you are right on time.
You are so lucky.


760
00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:45.810
What are those?

761
00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:58.330
Uncle, I don't understand at all.

762
00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:00.810
Believe me, I'm not surprised.

763
00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:04.970
Why? Who would do it?

764
00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:07.530
The entire country
was watching us that night.


765
00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:10.530
It was the worst place
to kill our most famous singer.


766
00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:12.210
So, it doesn't make sense.

767
00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:16.250
Right. First, the power goes out.
Then, the murder happens.


768
00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:19.690
It must have been organized.
There were multiple people involved.


769
00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:24.250
They were professionals too.
They thought about everything.


770
00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:25.570
They scouted the area too.

771
00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:28.090
But the question is,

772
00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:32.610
why was Işıl all alone in a room upstairs
right when the engagement was starting?


773
00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:34.810
She was hired to perform there.

774
00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:37.690
That's what we'll find out tonight.

775
00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:46.090
- Is this how we'll find out?
- What? You look great.


776
00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:51.290
Thank you for buying even the eyelashes,
but I can't see anything.


777
00:54:51.370 --> 00:54:53.890
And they hit the glasses I'm wearing.

778
00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:56.410
We are going to a '70s party.

779
00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:59.770
You are naturally camouflaged.
You complain too much.


780
00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:01.650
Why aren't you dressed up?

781
00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:04.970
If something goes wrong,
I don't want to be exposed, you jerk.


782
00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:18.530
The manager was the singer's
closest friend. They grew up together.


783
00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:23.570
She couldn't handle all that happened
and decided to go abroad for a while.


784
00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:28.210
We are going
to her farewell party right now.


785
00:55:28.290 --> 00:55:30.810
Fuck… My apologies, Müjde.

786
00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:32.850
You never know.

787
00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:36.290
She is the only person
who can tell us about the victim.


788
00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:43.370
Her flight is right after the party.
We can't afford to lose track of her.


789
00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:48.450
Well, that sounds good.
It will be a fun change.


790
00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:54.250
But doesn't she believe we are murderers?
Why would she help us?


791
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:59.370
She wouldn't talk to us.
Let me fix your hair.


792
00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:03.970
You guys go in and look around.
I'll take care of the rest.


793
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:07.090
Mr. Kazım! Bulut!

794
00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:10.330
Stop, man! I am here now!

795
00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:13.610
I'm here.

796
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:18.050
Bulut, I found a place in Bağcılar.

797
00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:22.090
See? I paid 1500 liras for them.
What a bargain!


798
00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:26.130
They are zirconia and better than before.
See, nothing happens.


799
00:56:27.690 --> 00:56:29.690
- Police! Uncle!
- Police.


800
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:32.210
- Okay, calm down.
- I look okay.


801
00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:34.810
- Calm down.
- My teeth hiss.


802
00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:36.490
Let me handle it.

803
00:56:38.570 --> 00:56:39.930
- Good evening.
- Good evening.


804
00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:41.690
Can I see your documents?

805
00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:47.370
- Here you go, Commander.
- Thanks.


806
00:56:50.090 --> 00:56:51.730
- Off to a mission?
- What?


807
00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:56.770
Officer, are you making fun of us? Huh?

808
00:56:56.850 --> 00:56:59.970
Who is your Inspector? 
Bring him here.

809
00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:02.810
- Don't look around, bring him!
- Major!


810
00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:06.610
He is doing his job. 
That's enough.

811
00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:08.930
Commander! Sir!

812
00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:12.330
It's not enough!
This officer has been disrespectful.


813
00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:14.770
"Off to a mission?" Off to a concert!

814
00:57:14.850 --> 00:57:17.890
We came here from the '70s
using a time machine.


815
00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:21.610
We are Led Zeppelin, only with a lady.

816
00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:24.090
I want to talk to your Inspector.

817
00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:28.490
Sometimes we get stressed
about the mission. My apologies.


818
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:30.290
- Good evening.
- Good evening.


819
00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:32.090
The door won't open.

820
00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:36.210
I swear it was
an Oscar worthy performance.


821
00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:38.690
Alright, but why?

822
00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:41.170
He was going to let us go
after checking his ID.


823
00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:44.610
You think so? I don't agree.
I think he was scared of me.


824
00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:45.730
Niyazi.

825
00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:50.970
I would have a few choice words for you
if it wasn't for the lady in the back.


826
00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:55.370
Alright, let's continue.

827
00:58:12.850 --> 00:58:16.930
There are two exits.
One is here. This is where I'll wait.


828
00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:19.890
You'll wait at the other exit
in the back, Niyazi.


829
00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:21.570
You'll go inside.

830
00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:24.250
<i>Follow the manager like a shadow.</i>

831
00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:26.330
<i>Keep an eye on her at all times.</i>

832
00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:00.970
Oh, wow!

833
00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:08.010
- Bulut, how do we find her in this crowd?
- I'm sure we'll find her.


834
00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:11.290
We're only here for formality.
My uncle will take care of it.


835
00:59:11.370 --> 00:59:16.650
- I love how chill you are.
- And I love how nervous you are.


836
00:59:17.770 --> 00:59:20.490
Relax a little.
You'll die young because of it.


837
00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:23.930
This may be the last party of our lives.
Enjoy it a little.


838
00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:27.410
Fine.

839
01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:50.690
- One. Hold me. Two. Three.
- What are you doing? Enough!


840
01:00:50.770 --> 01:00:55.930
I wish I made it to four.
But I'm too tired to continue.


841
01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:57.810
- Let's split.
- Good idea.


842
01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:03.130
What's that?

843
01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:25.650
Hey, buddy! Could you push her here?

844
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:27.010
Please.

845
01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:31.610
It's not her. Take her back.

846
01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:41.890
The tears of wine on the side of the glass
mean high alcohol content and full body.


847
01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:54.970
This is grape vinegar! 
Don't drink it!

848
01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:57.170
What are you doing?

849
01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:03.690
Don't make me say it in public.
I'm saying it with my face!


850
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:07.770
- I can't see it with your glasses!
- The manager left!


851
01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:10.370
- What?
- Call Mr. Kazım! Dammit!


852
01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:14.250
Come on!

853
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:19.290
Yes?

854
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:21.210
Okay.

855
01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:34.570
The bird has left the cage.

856
01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:38.450
What bird? What's going on?
Thanks for the warning.


857
01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:41.330
Come on!

858
01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:43.170
Excuse me, I ate too much.

859
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:44.530
We lost her!

860
01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:50.450
Niyazi, you goddamned pig!
We lost the manager!


861
01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:53.130
Is that the bird
Mr. Kazım was talking about?


862
01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:54.490
The manager!

863
01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:57.210
Excuse me. Manager.

864
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:05.010
<i>You'll fly under the radar.</i>

865
01:03:05.090 --> 01:03:09.210
<i>Once you are done,
put Aslıhan in the car and drive away.</i>


866
01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:21.530
Help!

867
01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:23.130
- Fuck.
- What happened?


868
01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:25.850
Help me! It's the murderer!

869
01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:28.170
Is there a problem?

870
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:31.290
Catch them! They killed Işıl
and they will kill me too!


871
01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:35.090
- We'll just ask her a question. Calm down.
- Shut up!


872
01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:39.050
- Calm down, this is not necessary.
- My keys!


873
01:03:39.130 --> 01:03:41.170
Muko, call the cops.

874
01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.170
- We just have a question.
- Shut up!


875
01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:46.570
Stand behind me.

876
01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:51.850
- Bulut is running away, Mr. Kazım!
- The manager is running away, not me!


877
01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:54.490
Come here!

878
01:04:20.330 --> 01:04:21.730
Mr. Kazım!

879
01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:25.250
Kazım!

880
01:04:44.170 --> 01:04:49.010
You are fucking useless,
but at least stop hindering us.


881
01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:51.290
She is a great runner.

882
01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:56.290
- Where is Müjde?
- What? Wasn't she with you?


883
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:02.330
There she is.

884
01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:07.210
Go back. Slow down. A bit more.

885
01:05:07.930 --> 01:05:12.370
Alright. Stop. Stop.

886
01:05:14.530 --> 01:05:17.890
Now we can proudly add kidnapping
to our long list of crimes.


887
01:05:17.970 --> 01:05:20.210
I agree, we went too far.

888
01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:22.730
We're acting too cool. 
What's our problem?

889
01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:25.050
She could have sat blindfolded
in the back seat.


890
01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:28.450
You went too far,
taping her body rigorously.


891
01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:30.330
- Too far?
- Too far.


892
01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:32.170
Sorry.

893
01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:34.410
Help me. I got her.

894
01:05:35.610 --> 01:05:37.450
- Come on.
- I got her.


895
01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:39.890
Is it good? It's comfortable.

896
01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:44.090
Let me help you.
I got her, wait. I got her.


897
01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:53.610
<i>It is unclear why the famous manager
has been kidnapped.</i>


898
01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:57.290
<i>Here is our interview
with the manager's family,</i>


899
01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:59.330
<i>who has been missing for three days.</i>

900
01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:02.570
<i>This song is for our rapper friends.</i>

901
01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:08.130
<i>- Ms. Leyla, when will you come back?
- I won't be back in Turkey for a while.</i>


902
01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:11.610
<i>Ms. Aslıhan got kidnapped.
She might have the same fate as Ms. Işıl.</i>


903
01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:17.450
<i>Just like you, I pray she will be saved
from those monsters soon.</i>


904
01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:20.810
<i>I know where you're going with this.</i>

905
01:06:20.890 --> 01:06:24.290
<i>But I won't say a word about him.
He is dead to me now.</i>


906
01:06:29.330 --> 01:06:30.330
Calm down.

907
01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:36.330
What she is going through is not easy.
Anybody would react the same.


908
01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:55.370
- Thanks.
- Enjoy.


909
01:06:56.690 --> 01:07:00.690
Look, we don't expect you
to believe our story.


910
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:04.170
But think about it. Look at us.
Why would we kill Işıl?


911
01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:06.290
What could be our problem with her?

912
01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:09.650
We won't kill you either.
We just want information.


913
01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:13.530
If you have nothing to say,
we can't keep you forever.


914
01:07:13.610 --> 01:07:15.090
We'll just let you go.

915
01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:19.730
We got the blame for this murder.
We don't know who did it and why.


916
01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:22.530
- May God damn them.
- May God damn them all.


917
01:07:22.610 --> 01:07:24.690
We just want to clear our names.

918
01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:27.890
You are the only person who can help us.
Do you understand?


919
01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:29.970
I think your friend would want it too.

920
01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:33.170
Because she'll find peace
when the real killers are found.


921
01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:35.730
- True.
- I can't forget her face.


922
01:07:35.810 --> 01:07:36.890
Sure. Your coffee.

923
01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:39.890
Let me untie your hand. 
Right or left?

924
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:44.810
Shame on you. She is doing this.

925
01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:49.330
She is just showing her hand.
Who fucking cares which hand she wants?


926
01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:52.690
- I'm accused of murder here!
- Stop yelling.


927
01:07:52.770 --> 01:07:54.970
Here is what she did! 
Give me a break.

928
01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:59.170
She won't help us now
with all your talking. Shame on you!


929
01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:02.570
I apologize.

930
01:08:04.090 --> 01:08:08.890
It's just for everyone's safety.
We'll drop you off near your house.


931
01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:14.970
Bye.

932
01:08:17.170 --> 01:08:21.130
He kills Işıl, leaves Leyla
during their engagement


933
01:08:21.210 --> 01:08:25.050
and runs off with Müjde.
What the hell? He is fucking evil.


934
01:08:26.050 --> 01:08:29.010
He kidnaps the manager, then releases her.

935
01:08:29.610 --> 01:08:31.970
He is making plans we don't understand.

936
01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:36.890
Please, it's not a plan.
He is trying to send us a message.


937
01:08:38.290 --> 01:08:40.130
He's saying they aren't killers.

938
01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:44.050
He questioned Ms. Aslıhan
just to look believable.


939
01:08:44.130 --> 01:08:45.130
- Right?
- Yeah.


940
01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:47.330
<i>Let's see the photos.</i>

941
01:08:48.490 --> 01:08:52.490
Is it so bad?
Hey, can you bring us lentil soup?


942
01:08:52.570 --> 01:08:56.170
- I don't want to get sick.
- Shut up! Turn up the volume!


943
01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:59.010
<i>I didn't share this info
because it wasn't confirmed.</i>


944
01:08:59.090 --> 01:09:04.650
<i>Now, there is a young lady here.
Haven't I told you a month ago?</i>


945
01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:06.850
What is she doing to that wall?

946
01:09:09.450 --> 01:09:12.810
She fucked up the wall.
We are going to have to paint it.


947
01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:17.610
Maybe wet wipes will be enough.
Huh? Don't you think?


948
01:09:19.450 --> 01:09:23.330
- So, where were we?
- You said you found the killer.


949
01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:26.050
Right. Listen.

950
01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:32.090
<i>Rafet was having problems with Hülya,
so he sought comfort in Işıl's arms.</i>


951
01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:35.170
<i>But soon, he realized
this was a terrible mistake.</i>


952
01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:38.610
<i>He loved his wife
and wanted to break up with Işıl.</i>


953
01:09:38.690 --> 01:09:42.850
<i>But Işıl was tenacious.
She didn't accept the breakup.</i>


954
01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:45.770
<i>She threatened
to leak the relationship to the press.</i>


955
01:09:45.850 --> 01:09:48.530
<i>Rafet realized
this wouldn't be settled amicably.</i>


956
01:09:48.610 --> 01:09:54.850
<i>He was out of time.
In a moment of breakdown, he killed Işıl.</i>


957
01:09:57.170 --> 01:09:58.170
Müjde.

958
01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:01.010
- I have two questions.
- Okay.


959
01:10:01.090 --> 01:10:02.690
One, what are you talking about?

960
01:10:02.770 --> 01:10:06.570
Two, why would he kill his lover
at his daughter's engagement?


961
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:11.290
Maybe it was the plan all along,
because people would think that way.


962
01:10:11.370 --> 01:10:13.290
What do you think, Mr. Kazım?

963
01:10:13.370 --> 01:10:18.170
Wouldn't we understand it if you told us
instead of drawing a photonovel?


964
01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:21.050
I guess we would, but anyway.

965
01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:25.490
I'm sorry, you are right.
I got excited and drew on the wall.


966
01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:29.930
I'm good at it.
It's the only way my mind works.


967
01:10:30.010 --> 01:10:33.690
As if you turn into Einstein!
Why not ask for a notebook and pen?


968
01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:36.410
- What is all this show about?
- Stop fighting.


969
01:10:37.090 --> 01:10:41.090
So, the deceased had
an extramarital relationship.


970
01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:44.770
Then, somebody leaked it to the press.
Is it coincidence?


971
01:10:44.850 --> 01:10:48.890
Coincidence? Please.
Nothing would surprise me anymore.


972
01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:52.490
He was my father-in-law.
Shameless old bastard!


973
01:10:53.370 --> 01:10:56.170
Says the guy
who escaped from his engagement


974
01:10:56.250 --> 01:10:58.050
because of the woman he impregnated.

975
01:10:58.130 --> 01:11:02.730
- Blah-blah-blah.
- Hey, get it together.


976
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:06.330
We have to find
him and make him talk.

977
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:09.930
True. He was her lover,
even if he didn't commit the murder.


978
01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:12.050
- He can give a lot of info.
- Right.


979
01:11:12.130 --> 01:11:17.090
- We'll go tomorrow night if it works.
- For sure, we have nothing else to do.


980
01:11:17.170 --> 01:11:19.330
I don't mean if it works for you.

981
01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:23.690
I mean if it works with
where he is, you idiot.


982
01:11:24.170 --> 01:11:28.290
Do we know where he could be?
I bet his wife kicked him out.


983
01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:31.250
- I'll show you, Rafet.
- Never mind him now.


984
01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:34.210
You think we can't clean it
with wet wipes?


985
01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:36.970
I'm sure we can.

986
01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:39.610
- The car is coming out.
- You're not allowed.


987
01:11:39.690 --> 01:11:43.050
- I'm from New York Freeball News.
- You can't.


988
01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:46.250
Look, I'm from Freeball TV.

989
01:11:46.330 --> 01:11:47.850
- Step back.
- One second.


990
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:50.490
- Step back, guys.
- Sir!


991
01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:56.210
- Let him go.
- They are talking about murder and stuff!


992
01:11:56.850 --> 01:11:59.290
- What does he think?
- Go away.


993
01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:01.930
Can you comment on the news?

994
01:12:02.010 --> 01:12:05.330
- Guys, please.
- Let us talk to him.


995
01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:10.410
<i>You can't take him out of there.</i>

996
01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:13.050
<i>You have to do everything in there.</i>

997
01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:16.410
<i>You have five minutes
to go in, make him talk and leave.</i>


998
01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:19.570
You get it? Now go.

999
01:12:19.650 --> 01:12:23.690
Bulut, the lawyer left.
Let's go! Come on, miss.


1000
01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:26.530
I'll tie the boat.

1001
01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:41.170
Are you expecting someone?

1002
01:12:52.330 --> 01:12:54.130
- What was that?
- He won't get knocked out!


1003
01:12:54.210 --> 01:12:55.610
It's not how you do it!

1004
01:12:57.490 --> 01:12:59.850
- Who is he?
- His right-hand man. Go!


1005
01:13:11.170 --> 01:13:14.530
He doesn't get knocked out like that!

1006
01:13:31.770 --> 01:13:33.530
- Finally.
- Who the hell are you?


1007
01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:36.050
- Shut up.
- Quiet.


1008
01:13:47.130 --> 01:13:48.250
You…

1009
01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:55.650
Since you are now after me,
you leaked the news to the press.


1010
01:13:56.650 --> 01:14:00.850
But why? Why do you do all this?
What do you want?


1011
01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:05.010
We are not here to hurt you.
We just want to talk. Calm down.


1012
01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:07.370
I'm calm.

1013
01:14:10.330 --> 01:14:13.610
- Müjde, stay back.
- Bulut, let me talk.


1014
01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:15.370
You'll get hurt, stay back.

1015
01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:19.290
- Why did you take your jacket off?
- Fuck this jacket.


1016
01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:24.450
Clearly, we'll do it the hard way
with my not-so-dear father-in-law.


1017
01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:28.610
Sir, just listen to us.
Give us five minutes.


1018
01:14:28.690 --> 01:14:33.330
It's not what you think.
Give us two minutes, please.


1019
01:14:49.410 --> 01:14:50.410
Yes.

1020
01:15:06.610 --> 01:15:09.850
- He is beating me up!
- He clearly has years of training.


1021
01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:11.050
Get up.

1022
01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:25.930
- I'm asking for help. He is messing me up!
- Please, get up.


1023
01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:27.530
Here he comes.

1024
01:15:37.170 --> 01:15:39.130
I'm sorry, Bulut!

1025
01:15:39.210 --> 01:15:41.450
I told you, this doesn't knock you out.

1026
01:15:43.530 --> 01:15:44.730
This does.

1027
01:16:18.570 --> 01:16:21.730
Stop for a second. Let's rest.

1028
01:16:22.330 --> 01:16:24.410
You aren't bad at all.

1029
01:16:25.770 --> 01:16:30.450
Never mind that.
Tell me, why did you kill your lover?


1030
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:34.330
You think you can use
reverse psychology on me?


1031
01:16:34.410 --> 01:16:39.970
If I had wanted her dead,
do you think I would have done it myself?


1032
01:16:40.050 --> 01:16:44.250
I'm worth four billion dollars.
I'm not just a regular guy.


1033
01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:46.530
- Is that so?
- Sure.


1034
01:16:49.330 --> 01:16:52.210
- How is Leyla?
- She is fine.


1035
01:16:52.770 --> 01:16:56.810
She is seeing Fırat again.

1036
01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:59.370
- What?
- What did you expect?


1037
01:16:59.450 --> 01:17:02.610
She was only with
you to make him jealous.

1038
01:17:02.690 --> 01:17:04.650
I know my own daughter.

1039
01:17:04.730 --> 01:17:10.290
That piece of shit, Fırat, is
actually with a model…


1040
01:17:12.330 --> 01:17:14.090
It has been half an hour.

1041
01:17:14.170 --> 01:17:19.610
We taught that clown well.
He can take care of an old man.


1042
01:17:20.490 --> 01:17:25.330
- It seems he did. He is coming.
- It seems he didn't.


1043
01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:33.570
- How many people beat him?
- One.


1044
01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:36.930
One.

1045
01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:42.970
- Did he say anything?
- He has no info, that horny old bastard.


1046
01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:44.770
Why was the victim upstairs?

1047
01:17:44.850 --> 01:17:47.810
They argued there
because he didn't know she'd come.


1048
01:17:47.890 --> 01:17:49.610
- Should I get on the boat?
- Yeah.


1049
01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:02.090
Slow down, we are not in a rush!

1050
01:18:02.170 --> 01:18:06.330
- There is one last possibility.
- And it's death! Slow down!


1051
01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:09.130
- It's your mother-in-law, Hülya.
- Mr. Kazım!


1052
01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:13.290
Hey, Niyazi fell down!

1053
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:17.330
<i>Maybe she knew
about their affair all along.</i>


1054
01:18:17.410 --> 01:18:21.850
<i>She found out how her husband planned
to divorce her and marry the victim.</i>


1055
01:18:22.930 --> 01:18:24.930
<i>She wanted revenge.</i>

1056
01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:30.050
<i>She took his love from him
on his happiest day.</i>


1057
01:18:30.130 --> 01:18:34.330
<i>Then, she leaked the affair to the press
and destroyed his reputation.</i>


1058
01:18:35.050 --> 01:18:38.210
<i>This helped her look like a victim too.</i>

1059
01:18:38.290 --> 01:18:42.130
<i>So, we'll follow her each step.</i>

1060
01:18:42.210 --> 01:18:44.730
<i>We'll know even when she breathes.</i>

1061
01:18:44.810 --> 01:18:49.090
<i>We'll get her as soon as
we find a clue about the murder.</i>


1062
01:18:49.170 --> 01:18:52.970
<i>Mom used to say, "Your husband's death
is like hitting your pinky toe."</i>


1063
01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:56.370
"It hurts for a moment, then it's okay."

1064
01:18:56.970 --> 01:18:59.770
- But Mr. Rafet didn't die.
- He is dead to me.


1065
01:18:59.850 --> 01:19:03.010
We will talk about
this once and for all.

1066
01:19:03.090 --> 01:19:07.490
Because it seems
you don't understand our relationship.


1067
01:19:07.570 --> 01:19:10.130
<i>Flash news! 
We caught them!</i>

1068
01:19:10.210 --> 01:19:14.130
<i>The famous couple was caught on camera
after coming home.</i>


1069
01:19:14.210 --> 01:19:18.930
<i>Flash news!
The lovers are back together again.</i>


1070
01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:22.570
You didn't need to.

1071
01:19:24.010 --> 01:19:27.970
The news don't upset me anymore.
I have no feelings for her.


1072
01:19:28.050 --> 01:19:29.330
She was using me after all.

1073
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:39.810
Should I go fishing?
I'll go fishing to pass the time.


1074
01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:43.450
- In this weather?
- I'm not sugar, I won't dissolve!


1075
01:19:44.370 --> 01:19:49.410
- But let me know if you don't like it.
- You mean if I like fish? I like it, sure.


1076
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:51.050
And some appetizers too?

1077
01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:55.530
- I'll cook this time.
- Deal.


1078
01:20:15.250 --> 01:20:17.570
I've spent six hours fishing.

1079
01:20:17.650 --> 01:20:21.410
I thought there'd be more fish
in this weather. No carp, no trout.


1080
01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:24.730
You want fish so bad? Here.

1081
01:20:26.490 --> 01:20:30.010
- You got anchovy.
- I only eat anchovy.


1082
01:20:30.090 --> 01:20:32.530
You can't find anchovy in a lake!

1083
01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:34.490
It's not a freshwater fish.
So embarrassing.


1084
01:20:34.570 --> 01:20:37.090
You can't stop lying for once.

1085
01:20:37.170 --> 01:20:39.530
It's not my fault. 
This lake has no fish.

1086
01:20:39.610 --> 01:20:42.330
I wouldn't have tried to show off
if I had known.


1087
01:20:42.410 --> 01:20:45.210
She prepared all that food.
It shouldn't go to waste.


1088
01:20:45.290 --> 01:20:49.090
<i>You stopped my daughter
from getting engaged to that bum,</i>


1089
01:20:49.170 --> 01:20:53.570
<i>and I paid you generously.
That's it. We did business.</i>


1090
01:20:53.650 --> 01:20:57.250
<i>You can't call me like a friend
whenever you want.</i>


1091
01:20:59.730 --> 01:21:03.690
The rest is unrelated.
There is nothing about the murder.


1092
01:21:04.490 --> 01:21:07.730
So, I haven't followed her
in this past week.


1093
01:21:08.290 --> 01:21:12.170
And you can relax.
You won't be a father, it was a lie.


1094
01:21:12.890 --> 01:21:14.250
Very funny!

1095
01:21:15.930 --> 01:21:17.250
It was a joke.

1096
01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:20.810
- He is tense today.
- He is.


1097
01:21:21.650 --> 01:21:24.370
But that woman is insane.

1098
01:21:24.450 --> 01:21:27.770
She did that
to stop her daughter's engagement?


1099
01:21:31.570 --> 01:21:34.570
- Thank you for buying the fish, Mr. Kazım.
- Enjoy.


1100
01:21:34.650 --> 01:21:36.290
Yes, thank you.

1101
01:21:36.370 --> 01:21:39.170
I don't like freshwater fish
due to all their fish bones.


1102
01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:42.170
Look, I have a spot in Rumeli Kavağı.

1103
01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:44.770
When I fish there,
I never return empty-handed.


1104
01:21:44.850 --> 01:21:47.810
- We can even catch bluefish.
- Sure.


1105
01:21:48.930 --> 01:21:52.170
But we should go
when it's the right season.


1106
01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:54.930
Ask him if he can even recognize bluefish.

1107
01:21:55.730 --> 01:21:58.970
He thinks this is anchovy, not bonito.
That's what he told me.


1108
01:21:59.810 --> 01:22:03.170
Please, I'm a Bosporus kid.
I can recognize bonito.


1109
01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:05.850
This is mackerel, you Bosporus kid!

1110
01:22:08.210 --> 01:22:09.810
Fine, I don't really know fish.

1111
01:22:23.530 --> 01:22:24.810
Alright!

1112
01:22:25.330 --> 01:22:26.530
Quads!

1113
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:29.530
But it won't help me.

1114
01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:33.650
This is like hitting the only tree
in a savannah. Jeez!


1115
01:22:38.010 --> 01:22:39.010
My teeth!

1116
01:22:39.730 --> 01:22:44.450
They still couldn't properly fix
my implants, Kadir!


1117
01:22:45.290 --> 01:22:46.690
Wait here.

1118
01:22:47.610 --> 01:22:48.850
Wait a minute.

1119
01:22:57.650 --> 01:22:59.010
Mr. Niyazi.

1120
01:23:00.010 --> 01:23:01.930
Ms. Aslıhan. How can I help?

1121
01:23:07.290 --> 01:23:11.930
Tell me, how can I help you?
Is there an engagement or wedding?


1122
01:23:12.410 --> 01:23:15.530
We have some rare pieces on the right.

1123
01:23:15.610 --> 01:23:17.410
Let me kiss it.

1124
01:23:18.250 --> 01:23:19.250
These pieces…

1125
01:23:19.290 --> 01:23:20.330
- Mr. Niyazi.
- Yes?


1126
01:23:20.410 --> 01:23:24.090
Thank you, but I'm not here to shop.
Müjde gave me this address


1127
01:23:24.170 --> 01:23:27.450
in case I need to reach them
about the developments.


1128
01:23:34.050 --> 01:23:36.730
You really are a decent person.

1129
01:23:36.810 --> 01:23:41.890
All this time, you've kept Bulut's secret
instead of going to the police.


1130
01:23:41.970 --> 01:23:43.130
Hats off to you.

1131
01:23:44.730 --> 01:23:47.450
A diamond. Wouldn't you want one?

1132
01:23:48.170 --> 01:23:51.050
It would look great.
I have a supplier in Antwerp.


1133
01:23:51.130 --> 01:23:54.410
- Was this a venue employee?
- Yes.


1134
01:23:57.010 --> 01:24:00.890
They told her to cut the power
for a surprise.


1135
01:24:00.970 --> 01:24:03.730
And they gave her a bunch of money.

1136
01:24:03.810 --> 01:24:07.450
She believed them, the poor thing.
She didn't realize until the murder.


1137
01:24:07.530 --> 01:24:12.210
Then, she got scared and quit her job.
She has been hiding since then.


1138
01:24:13.370 --> 01:24:16.970
- Why didn't she go to the police?
- I don't know.


1139
01:24:17.450 --> 01:24:20.010
We'll find out when we get there.

1140
01:24:20.090 --> 01:24:25.010
Finally! The culprit is
whoever asked her to cut the power off.


1141
01:24:25.090 --> 01:24:27.290
We have our murderer.
The nightmare is over.


1142
01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:29.970
But this was too easy.

1143
01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:32.410
What? Do you want me
to get beaten up again?


1144
01:24:32.490 --> 01:24:35.370
No, why do you say that?
Does it hurt a lot?


1145
01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:36.850
Obviously.

1146
01:24:36.930 --> 01:24:38.970
- Turn left here.
- You sure?


1147
01:24:39.050 --> 01:24:41.370
- Yes.
- Is it on the right?


1148
01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:43.290
- Yes.
- Here?


1149
01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:10.290
The door is open.

1150
01:25:17.210 --> 01:25:18.250
Be careful.

1151
01:25:43.170 --> 01:25:44.450
What?

1152
01:25:46.410 --> 01:25:48.010
What is it?

1153
01:25:51.930 --> 01:25:52.970
Dead.

1154
01:25:56.210 --> 01:25:58.490
Hey, stay there!

1155
01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:01.610
Come here! Stay there!

1156
01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:05.290
We need to go, Uncle. 
The police are here.

1157
01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:08.250
Let's go.

1158
01:26:17.890 --> 01:26:20.290
- We'll go through here.
- Mr. Kazım!


1159
01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:23.290
- Girl.
- Girl… Yes?


1160
01:26:24.090 --> 01:26:25.210
Never mind.

1161
01:26:26.130 --> 01:26:27.130
God!

1162
01:26:33.610 --> 01:26:37.250
It knocked my breath out.
This doesn't happen in the movies!


1163
01:26:37.330 --> 01:26:40.450
Why jump into the dumpster
instead of the ground?


1164
01:26:40.530 --> 01:26:42.090
Run!

1165
01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:44.530
Stop! Police!

1166
01:26:51.770 --> 01:26:54.290
Run! What the hell?

1167
01:26:57.290 --> 01:27:01.690
Come on! Are you okay?
You look white. Hang tight!


1168
01:27:01.770 --> 01:27:04.370
- You love action.
- I do!


1169
01:27:04.450 --> 01:27:05.850
What's wrong then? Come on!

1170
01:27:06.730 --> 01:27:08.010
Come on!

1171
01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:15.410
She fainted!

1172
01:27:15.490 --> 01:27:19.290
Are you telling me, you idiot?
You think I can't see?


1173
01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:22.010
Get her up! Now!

1174
01:27:26.890 --> 01:27:30.250
- I had to leave her!
- I can see it!


1175
01:27:30.330 --> 01:27:34.130
- Won't you do anything?
- Like what, shoot a police officer?


1176
01:27:34.210 --> 01:27:38.650
- Go! Come on!
- Müjde!


1177
01:27:43.330 --> 01:27:44.410
Müjde!

1178
01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:48.610
The key is here.

1179
01:27:50.490 --> 01:27:53.690
Get on it!

1180
01:28:01.290 --> 01:28:02.690
Are you stupid?

1181
01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:06.570
You have made too many mistakes.

1182
01:28:07.170 --> 01:28:12.170
If you had called for backup,
we'd have them now. Get lost.


1183
01:28:47.490 --> 01:28:51.450
Alright. Get it together. Calm down.

1184
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:53.770
We almost got caught.

1185
01:28:53.850 --> 01:28:58.570
I wish we got caught instead of
leaving Müjde behind like cowards!


1186
01:28:58.650 --> 01:29:02.770
You think I'm scared of prison?
I'm doing it all for you!


1187
01:29:03.370 --> 01:29:06.330
If we get caught,
who'll figure this thing out? Mr. Niyazi?


1188
01:29:09.250 --> 01:29:10.970
Who is calling this late?

1189
01:29:15.130 --> 01:29:17.010
- What the hell?
- Müjde!


1190
01:29:18.410 --> 01:29:22.170
<i>I'll send you a location.
If you aren't there at midnight,</i>


1191
01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:25.810
<i>I'll call again to show you
how I shoot her in the head.</i>


1192
01:29:25.890 --> 01:29:27.850
<i>- Is it clear enough?</i>
- Hey!


1193
01:29:28.330 --> 01:29:31.930
- How? The police got Müjde.
- I don't know.


1194
01:29:32.010 --> 01:29:34.810
- You don't know? Who is this?
- I don't know.


1195
01:29:35.410 --> 01:29:38.290
- How does he know your number?
- I don't know.


1196
01:29:38.370 --> 01:29:40.730
- You don't know?
- I don't know!


1197
01:29:41.450 --> 01:29:44.690
Jeez, what's wrong with you?

1198
01:29:45.850 --> 01:29:47.610
I'm telling you, I don't know!

1199
01:30:09.410 --> 01:30:14.330
The bald Chief and my idol Cevat
still scold me about these guys.


1200
01:30:14.410 --> 01:30:19.890
The idiots still believe that I released
the names to the press by accident.


1201
01:30:19.970 --> 01:30:23.450
Like you said, we owe you
for everything you did that night.


1202
01:30:25.650 --> 01:30:27.450
You've earned it.

1203
01:30:29.970 --> 01:30:31.890
CHECK FOR 500,000 TURKISH LIRAS

1204
01:30:47.050 --> 01:30:48.210
Give me your hand.

1205
01:30:50.090 --> 01:30:52.930
Hold it. Put your finger through.

1206
01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:55.890
Alright, now press.

1207
01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:03.410
No.

1208
01:31:06.890 --> 01:31:08.010
See?

1209
01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:11.890
Now you killed a cop too.

1210
01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:32.290
Love, I'm sick of
the entertainment business.


1211
01:31:32.770 --> 01:31:34.930
I get tired, it gets too loud.

1212
01:31:35.610 --> 01:31:40.370
I want to sell all my clubs and go into
the energy sector. What do you think?


1213
01:31:40.930 --> 01:31:43.930
I've been telling you,
that's not necessary.


1214
01:31:44.010 --> 01:31:47.330
- Just sell your hotels.
- You are right.


1215
01:31:53.370 --> 01:31:58.210
Love, I have some urgent business.
Would it be okay if I left?


1216
01:31:58.290 --> 01:32:02.650
Sure, I'll leave early anyway.
Girls and I are going to Milano tomorrow.


1217
01:32:03.210 --> 01:32:05.490
- You are so beautiful.
- Thank you.


1218
01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:34.930
Bulut! Mr. Kazım!

1219
01:32:36.810 --> 01:32:38.890
Thank God.

1220
01:32:40.610 --> 01:32:44.610
- Girl, are you okay?
- I am. Bulut…


1221
01:32:44.690 --> 01:32:46.810
Bulut!

1222
01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:55.130
Müjde, are you okay?
Did these bastards hurt you?


1223
01:32:55.210 --> 01:32:59.570
I'm okay, but why did you come for me?
Now they'll kill all of us.


1224
01:32:59.650 --> 01:33:01.770
- How is your arm?
- It hurts a bit.


1225
01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:04.010
We'll throw you overboard.

1226
01:33:04.890 --> 01:33:08.610
The police will keep looking for you
since they won't know you are dead.


1227
01:33:08.690 --> 01:33:11.170
So, your father-in-law was
behind the whole thing?


1228
01:33:11.970 --> 01:33:14.730
I haven't worked for Mr. Rafet
in a long time.


1229
01:33:14.810 --> 01:33:18.930
I mean, I have,
but I have a better paying side hustle.


1230
01:33:23.530 --> 01:33:24.610
You!

1231
01:33:30.210 --> 01:33:32.610
Excuse me, I'm looking for Mr. Niyazi…

1232
01:33:34.490 --> 01:33:39.490
Bulut… Do you know
the amount of trouble you caused me?


1233
01:33:39.570 --> 01:33:43.890
You almost messed up the plan
I've been working on for five years.


1234
01:33:43.970 --> 01:33:45.370
What plan?

1235
01:33:46.170 --> 01:33:48.770
You think I'd let you have Leyla?

1236
01:33:48.850 --> 01:33:52.010
You wanted to get the girl
and take over the holding company.


1237
01:33:52.730 --> 01:33:54.730
Well, I spent years for it!

1238
01:33:56.090 --> 01:33:58.490
It was all about the money. Incredible.

1239
01:33:58.570 --> 01:34:01.730
Then, what was your problem
with that poor woman?


1240
01:34:01.810 --> 01:34:04.330
What did Işıl do?
What did she have to do with it?


1241
01:34:05.010 --> 01:34:06.770
How about this?

1242
01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:10.730
I'll send you guys to her
and you can ask her yourselves, okay?


1243
01:34:10.810 --> 01:34:12.010
She is right.

1244
01:34:12.490 --> 01:34:15.570
Why didn't you come to me?
Why did she have to die?


1245
01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:19.930
It was an occupational accident.
I meant to kill you that night.


1246
01:34:20.010 --> 01:34:23.930
But you decided to escape
from the ceremony at the last minute.


1247
01:34:24.650 --> 01:34:27.810
She was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.


1248
01:34:27.890 --> 01:34:31.530
<i>It was just unlucky. 
I'm so sad about it.</i>

1249
01:34:32.170 --> 01:34:33.730
Are you nuts?

1250
01:34:34.450 --> 01:34:39.450
If your idea was to kill him,
why didn't you do it at the right time?


1251
01:34:39.530 --> 01:34:43.210
Why did you orchestrate
this whole thing, you idiot?


1252
01:34:43.290 --> 01:34:46.450
- What are you talking about?
- It's not how you do it.


1253
01:34:46.530 --> 01:34:49.850
You could just cut him off in your car,
open your window,


1254
01:34:49.930 --> 01:34:52.890
shoot him in the head twice
and be done with it.


1255
01:34:52.970 --> 01:34:56.050
- This is how you do it, Mr. Kazım.
- Right.


1256
01:34:56.130 --> 01:35:00.250
Enough! Ateş, why didn't I think of that?

1257
01:35:01.290 --> 01:35:04.730
I'm sure Leyla was only with him
because she was mad at me.


1258
01:35:04.810 --> 01:35:08.690
I waited for her to get cold feet,
but she didn't.


1259
01:35:08.770 --> 01:35:11.770
And that made me worried.

1260
01:35:12.370 --> 01:35:15.930
What if she truly loved you?
I couldn't take that risk.


1261
01:35:17.290 --> 01:35:19.930
Enough with the chitchat.

1262
01:35:20.010 --> 01:35:24.210
Your time ends here, unfortunately.

1263
01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:26.490
- So?
- "So" what?


1264
01:35:27.170 --> 01:35:28.850
You won't do anything?

1265
01:35:28.930 --> 01:35:31.970
What can we do? 
Our hands are tied.

1266
01:35:32.050 --> 01:35:36.130
Did you come all that way
fucking empty-handed?


1267
01:35:36.210 --> 01:35:38.610
- Excuse me, Mr. Kazım.
- It's fine.


1268
01:35:38.690 --> 01:35:39.690
You had no plan?

1269
01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:42.130
God!

1270
01:35:42.210 --> 01:35:45.010
Put it down! She
is always ready to kill!

1271
01:35:45.090 --> 01:35:50.130
I have blood phobia, don't you understand?
Do it once I'm gone.


1272
01:35:50.650 --> 01:35:52.090
- Fırat!
- What?


1273
01:35:53.570 --> 01:35:57.010
You were an asshole, but thank you.

1274
01:35:57.090 --> 01:35:59.730
Why? Because I'm saving you
from your miserable life?


1275
01:35:59.810 --> 01:36:03.770
No, because you told everything.
You could keep it to yourself.


1276
01:36:03.850 --> 01:36:05.330
Fuck off.

1277
01:36:05.410 --> 01:36:10.450
Attention! You have been surrounded!
You have nowhere to run!


1278
01:36:10.530 --> 01:36:11.970
- What the hell?
- Surrender!


1279
01:36:12.490 --> 01:36:13.850
Ateş, what the hell?

1280
01:36:13.930 --> 01:36:15.130
It's the police.

1281
01:36:15.210 --> 01:36:17.530
You're right about the jerk,

1282
01:36:17.610 --> 01:36:22.370
but I'm really, really, really hurt
that you thought I didn't have a plan.


1283
01:36:22.450 --> 01:36:24.530
We'll make them talk.

1284
01:36:24.610 --> 01:36:27.490
We'll make them confess everything
and record it, okay?


1285
01:36:27.570 --> 01:36:31.450
Okay, that's easy to do,
but how are we going to save our asses?


1286
01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:35.570
Tell me, what is it?

1287
01:36:35.650 --> 01:36:39.850
I know where Bulut and Müjde are.
I'm here to report it.


1288
01:36:40.810 --> 01:36:43.130
Surrender! You have nowhere to run!

1289
01:37:07.530 --> 01:37:14.490
Bulut, this place is awesome.
If I knew it, I'd get married too.


1290
01:37:14.570 --> 01:37:17.930
Will you organize a night like this for me
if I get married?


1291
01:37:18.010 --> 01:37:20.690
You will, right?

1292
01:37:20.770 --> 01:37:26.210
Jeez, do you think you are
my brother-in-law because I like you?


1293
01:37:26.290 --> 01:37:29.290
- You are married to my sister!
- Oh!


1294
01:37:29.370 --> 01:37:31.610
But seriously,
if I hadn't listened to Niyazi


1295
01:37:31.690 --> 01:37:35.010
and escaped from my engagement,
I would be dead now, Alper.


1296
01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:36.730
He is a smart man.

1297
01:37:48.490 --> 01:37:52.770
Interesting! You come here
so often these days, Mr. Bulut.


1298
01:37:52.850 --> 01:37:54.770
- Well, it's a beautiful place.
- Really?


1299
01:37:54.850 --> 01:37:56.850
It's truly, incredibly beautiful.

1300
01:37:59.450 --> 01:38:01.530
My mom is inviting you to dinner tomorrow.

1301
01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:04.490
- Who?
- My mom. She is inviting you to dinner.


1302
01:38:06.090 --> 01:38:07.330
Me?

1303
01:38:09.370 --> 01:38:10.370
It got in my eye.

1304
01:38:14.890 --> 01:38:18.530
- I mixed up their order.
- From sour to more sour.


1305
01:38:19.770 --> 01:38:22.930
My uncle will be there too.
He made up with my dad.


1306
01:38:23.010 --> 01:38:25.050
- I don't want him to come.
- Why?


1307
01:38:25.130 --> 01:38:27.210
- I don't know.
- He can come.


1308
01:38:29.290 --> 01:38:32.130
Bring new ones,
I can't take these to the customers.


1309
01:38:32.210 --> 01:38:33.930
Imagine me drunk!

1310
01:38:34.610 --> 01:38:36.050
Your mom is inviting me?

1311
01:38:36.130 --> 01:38:38.410
- Wipe your mouth.
- But with this.


1312
01:38:39.210 --> 01:38:41.450
- It will burn.
- It does.


1313
01:38:41.530 --> 01:38:43.890
- Your lips will be dry.
- They are.


1314
01:38:51.250 --> 01:38:53.090
It's not how you
play a 4-2, you jerk!

1315
01:38:53.810 --> 01:38:57.730
I'm doing it my way.
Worry about your own play. Jeez!


1316
01:38:57.810 --> 01:38:59.850
You jerk! Here!

1317
01:39:00.450 --> 01:39:01.810
Go on.

1318
01:39:01.890 --> 01:39:04.650
- Hey, boy!
- Bekir! Bring it back!


1319
01:39:05.770 --> 01:39:08.170
Bekir!

1320
01:39:08.250 --> 01:39:09.410
- Bulut.
- What?


1321
01:39:09.490 --> 01:39:12.050
What do you mean
you haven't opened up yet?


1322
01:39:12.130 --> 01:39:15.930
If you think you can't do it,
I can handle it as your brother-in-law.


1323
01:39:16.010 --> 01:39:19.130
Sure, but I don't need you to.
Thank you so much.


1324
01:39:19.210 --> 01:39:22.570
I'll take care of it tonight.
I have a nice plan.


1325
01:39:22.650 --> 01:39:23.810
It will work!

1326
01:39:23.890 --> 01:39:26.850
I saw how she looked at you last night.
She loves you too.


1327
01:39:26.930 --> 01:39:28.690
- Right?
- She does.


1328
01:39:28.770 --> 01:39:30.410
Where were you last night?

1329
01:39:31.650 --> 01:39:35.250
You had fun without me?
Without your brother-in-law?


1330
01:39:36.450 --> 01:39:40.170
Alright then.
See, you can't look me in the eye.


1331
01:39:41.410 --> 01:39:42.810
She is here!

1332
01:39:48.730 --> 01:39:49.770
Not talking to you.

1333
01:39:51.410 --> 01:39:54.930
- Tell me what happened.
- I heard noises one night.


1334
01:39:55.010 --> 01:39:56.450
I went to see with my rifle.

1335
01:39:56.530 --> 01:39:59.730
I saw them entering through the window
and turned on the lights…


1336
01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:02.850
His face was frozen.

1337
01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:06.090
- Enjoy.
- Thank you, thanks.


1338
01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:09.410
Stop looking at me. Look ahead.

1339
01:40:12.850 --> 01:40:16.650
- Let me tuck your hair behind your ear.
- My hair… Your mom is here!


1340
01:40:28.610 --> 01:40:30.610
Have you sold your new script?

1341
01:40:31.210 --> 01:40:35.210
No, but I'm used to it.
I'd be surprised if I could.


1342
01:40:35.290 --> 01:40:37.090
They say people don't love action.

1343
01:40:37.170 --> 01:40:41.170
- Love?
- Yes, it's how this business is.


1344
01:40:41.250 --> 01:40:43.410
No, your new script should be about love.

1345
01:40:43.490 --> 01:40:44.570
Oh.

1346
01:40:45.170 --> 01:40:48.130
Well, the script is ready
and we know the leads.
