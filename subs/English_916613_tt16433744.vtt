1
00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:09.759
The collector's mentality is
that you can never have enough.


2
00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:11.627
And that's very dangerous.

3
00:00:11.727 --> 00:00:14.630
Oh, my God,
this is unbelievable!


4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.066
It became just an obsession.

5
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.734
What do
you think about grown-ups


6
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:22.371
jumping out of their
car to get a Beanie Baby?


7
00:00:22.438 --> 00:00:23.438
Insane.

8
00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:25.975
Perhaps the biggest
toy craze in history.


9
00:00:26.075 --> 00:00:28.644
Bigger than
Frank Sinatra, the Beatles


10
00:00:28.744 --> 00:00:30.046
and Elvis Presley combined.

11
00:00:30.112 --> 00:00:31.948
I would've paid whatever it took

12
00:00:32.048 --> 00:00:34.450
to get that Beanie Baby
at the time.


13
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.887
$10,000.

14
00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:40.890
Without the few women

15
00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:42.792
that started the entire mania,

16
00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:44.927
Beanie Babies
never would've been.


17
00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:48.731
Just moms getting together
and creating something.


18
00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:50.166
We didn't get along,

19
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.968
there was a lot of competition,
you know.


20
00:00:52.068 --> 00:00:55.071
If you don't have a number,
you're not gonna be let in.


21
00:00:55.137 --> 00:00:57.106
They would just lunge and grab.

22
00:00:57.173 --> 00:01:01.911
The Beanie Baby craze
is reaching insane proportions.


23
00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:05.481
Ty Warner did absolutely
no advertising.


24
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:07.817
It was almost as if there
was no guy behind them.


25
00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:11.354
Have either one
of you ever met Ty Warner?


26
00:01:11.454 --> 00:01:12.488
- Never.
- No.


27
00:01:12.588 --> 00:01:14.490
Like the Wizard of Oz.

28
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.126
Can we come in here and talk
about the Beanie Babies?


29
00:01:17.193 --> 00:01:18.461
No.

30
00:01:18.527 --> 00:01:20.363
It was a really nice
thing for a while,


31
00:01:20.463 --> 00:01:22.164
until the adults ruined it.

32
00:01:22.264 --> 00:01:26.335
Today that $1500
investment we are told


33
00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:29.372
would be worth about $75,000.

34
00:01:29.472 --> 00:01:33.542
I'm happy. I'm going to get
a lot of money now.


35
00:01:33.643 --> 00:01:35.711
There was no evidence
that they would ever


36
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:37.847
be worth anything,
we just believed it.


37
00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:40.883
Something happened with
Beanie Babies,


38
00:01:40.983 --> 00:01:42.718
that's all everybody wants.

39
00:01:42.818 --> 00:01:44.987
They are magical,
and you get addicted.


40
00:01:46.722 --> 00:01:48.724
I never was
addicted to anything,


41
00:01:48.824 --> 00:01:50.326
and I got addicted
to Beanie Babies.


42
00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:53.529
And I ran amok.

43
00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:15.418
Hi, I'm Mary Beth Sobolewski.

44
00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:16.919
Hi, I'm Becky Phillips.

45
00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.654
Hi, I'm Joni Hirsch
-Blackman.

46
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.193
Naperville is a town about

47
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.661
Very child-friendly,

48
00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:29.265
we won every 'greatest place to
raise your child' type of awards


49
00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:30.666
over the years.

50
00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:38.074
Ha! Colorado Court.

51
00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:40.609
People in the neighbourhood
would say,


52
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.014
"Oh, you live on Colorado Court,
you guys have a lot of fun."


53
00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:48.117
Hi, how you doing?
Glad to see ya.


54
00:02:48.217 --> 00:02:52.088
Becky Phillips just lives
a few doors down from here.


55
00:02:52.188 --> 00:02:55.791
Before Beanie Babies, I was
a language-arts teacher.


56
00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:59.128
Once I had children,
I stopped teaching.


57
00:02:59.228 --> 00:03:00.963
So I was a full-time mom.

58
00:03:01.063 --> 00:03:04.633
But I'm very competitive.
I come from a family of 11.


59
00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:07.103
But I get involved
with something,


60
00:03:07.203 --> 00:03:08.738
I want to go 100% in.

61
00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.142
I worked for IBM
for about 10 years.


62
00:03:13.242 --> 00:03:15.144
I was a systems engineer.

63
00:03:15.244 --> 00:03:18.214
And I loved it.

64
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.318
But then I turned it all in
to be a full-time mom.


65
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.491
I've been working from home
almost from the very beginning.


66
00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:32.495
I was carpooling three
children. A lot of sweat suits.


67
00:03:32.595 --> 00:03:36.165
Big hair. In the early '90s,
I had a perm.


68
00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:39.635
I was a journalist
for 'People Magazine'.


69
00:03:39.735 --> 00:03:43.405
I spent a lot of time with my
kids. It was a great time.


70
00:03:43.472 --> 00:03:44.740
It was a lot of fun.

71
00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:51.180
I think of the '90s
as sort of frivolous.


72
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.582
Socker Boppers! 
Socker Boppers!

73
00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:56.318
You can sock all day
and bop all night...


74
00:03:56.418 --> 00:04:01.791
I think it was a very quiet,
non-tumultuous time


75
00:04:01.857 --> 00:04:04.093
preceding 9/11.

76
00:04:07.963 --> 00:04:10.533
It just seemed like a very quiet

77
00:04:10.633 --> 00:04:11.467
time in our world

78
00:04:11.534 --> 00:04:13.369
where people were happy.

79
00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:18.374
We enjoyed collecting.

80
00:04:18.474 --> 00:04:22.178
Especially in
the Chicagoland area.


81
00:04:22.278 --> 00:04:26.048
Each of my kids
started collecting things early.


82
00:04:26.148 --> 00:04:28.884
One of them collected baseballs.

83
00:04:28.984 --> 00:04:30.052
One of my daughters

84
00:04:30.152 --> 00:04:31.887
even collected
unsharpened pencils.


85
00:04:31.987 --> 00:04:35.558
So we collect, we collect.
It was fun.


86
00:04:42.164 --> 00:04:46.902
The first Beanie Baby
I ever saw was the lobster.


87
00:04:47.002 --> 00:04:49.572
A Beanie Baby is
a small stuffed animal


88
00:04:49.672 --> 00:04:51.016
that fits
in the palm of your hand.


89
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.043
It's very poseable,
so you could sit it,


90
00:04:54.143 --> 00:04:56.045
you can fix the arms
a little bit.


91
00:04:56.145 --> 00:04:58.647
It has very expressive eyes.

92
00:04:58.714 --> 00:05:04.220
You almost feel like the
Beanie Baby is a little person.


93
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.089
It has a personality.

94
00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:09.134
The Beanie Babies have a hanging
tag on them that say 'Ty'.


95
00:05:09.158 --> 00:05:12.528
Now, I didn't know what
exactly that meant.


96
00:05:12.595 --> 00:05:15.598
I didn't know at the time that
there was one guy


97
00:05:15.698 --> 00:05:17.266
and that his name was Ty.

98
00:05:19.535 --> 00:05:25.441
Ty Warner, I like to say
is like the Wizard of Oz.


99
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:27.176
Ty Warner is a real character.

100
00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:29.278
There were always
rumours about him.


101
00:05:29.378 --> 00:05:35.050
Not many people knew
Ty Warner the person.


102
00:05:35.117 --> 00:05:37.887
Including me.

103
00:05:37.953 --> 00:05:39.788
Deep down, he's very insecure.

104
00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.124
That's why he's so private.

105
00:05:45.694 --> 00:05:50.065
Ty Warner is a young man
whose father worked for me,


106
00:05:50.132 --> 00:05:51.634
as a salesman.

107
00:05:51.734 --> 00:05:57.239
And then Ty began selling our
toys after his father retired.


108
00:05:57.306 --> 00:06:02.544
He got his training with us
at our company, Dakin Toys.


109
00:06:02.611 --> 00:06:04.747
And became our
number-one salesman.


110
00:06:04.813 --> 00:06:07.149
We were doing over $200 million.

111
00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:11.320
He had a big ego, and that
was all part of his thing.


112
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.890
I still beat him on the tennis
courts.


113
00:06:14.957 --> 00:06:18.794
He left us
and went out on his own.


114
00:06:18.894 --> 00:06:21.130
He hit the market at a time

115
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.633
when collectibles were in vogue.

116
00:06:25.935 --> 00:06:29.104
The best advice
I gave him was to


117
00:06:29.171 --> 00:06:30.406
come up with a good name,

118
00:06:30.472 --> 00:06:32.775
and make a quality product.

119
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:35.945
And market the devil out of it.
And that's what he did.


120
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.849
Ty Products were a
small manufacturing company.


121
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.353
It wasn't huge, that's for sure

122
00:06:44.453 --> 00:06:47.856
but Ty Warner had an air
of success.


123
00:06:47.957 --> 00:06:51.760
And a confidence that he was
going to be more successful.


124
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:56.031
Our family owned a small
manufacturing company


125
00:06:56.131 --> 00:06:58.834
in Canada that was
in the gift trade,


126
00:06:58.934 --> 00:07:00.269
and wanted to go and look

127
00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:02.805
for some lines that we could
possibly distribute.


128
00:07:03.973 --> 00:07:05.441
I used to travel down to Chicago

129
00:07:05.507 --> 00:07:07.876
where Ty's head office was.

130
00:07:07.977 --> 00:07:10.446
And he would show me the new
products he was developing,


131
00:07:10.512 --> 00:07:15.384
and he passed me
this little green frog.


132
00:07:15.484 --> 00:07:18.620
He said "Bill, you are gonna
put every dollar you have"


133
00:07:18.687 --> 00:07:20.723
"into that product."

134
00:07:20.823 --> 00:07:25.194
I needed about $500,000 to
really get this off the ground.


135
00:07:25.294 --> 00:07:29.498
You know, for a 27-year-old,
that was a lot of money.


136
00:07:30.466 --> 00:07:31.734
But I thought, "I gotta do this"

137
00:07:31.834 --> 00:07:35.337
"because if I don't do this,
someone else is going to do it."


138
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.913
The office was small in
the very beginning.


139
00:07:45.014 --> 00:07:47.516
And I was employee number 12.

140
00:07:47.583 --> 00:07:49.251
And I remember I was 12 because

141
00:07:49.351 --> 00:07:51.487
everybody used to say
"You're the 12th employee!"


142
00:07:51.553 --> 00:07:53.422
And it was, like, exciting.

143
00:07:53.522 --> 00:08:00.763
My parents immigrated
here from India in 1972.


144
00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:04.033
They wanted me to be a doctor.

145
00:08:04.099 --> 00:08:09.271
The stereotypical
sort of profession.


146
00:08:09.371 --> 00:08:11.607
But I couldn't stand blood.

147
00:08:11.707 --> 00:08:14.109
So I started at Ty.

148
00:08:14.209 --> 00:08:17.346
My job was a telemarketer and
when I walked in,


149
00:08:17.413 --> 00:08:18.680
I remember I was looking around

150
00:08:18.747 --> 00:08:22.084
and saw all the stuffed animals
and I was just thinking,


151
00:08:22.184 --> 00:08:26.255
"This is so cool,
this is a toy company!"


152
00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.528
So we had the first nine
prototypes


153
00:08:32.594 --> 00:08:34.229
and they didn't have a name

154
00:08:34.296 --> 00:08:38.600
and there were a lot of
different names bouncing around.


155
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.570
And then somebody
said 'Beanie Babies'.


156
00:08:41.637 --> 00:08:45.140
And everyone was like
"Oh! That's it."


157
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.708
Legs, Chocolate, Pinchers,

158
00:08:46.775 --> 00:08:49.578
Patti, Flash, Squealer,
Splash, Spot and Cubbie.


159
00:08:52.414 --> 00:08:55.250
In the early days,
Ty went to the stores himself.


160
00:08:55.317 --> 00:08:57.553
He always drove
a very unusual car.


161
00:08:57.619 --> 00:09:00.656
And often would drive around
with a full-length fur coat.


162
00:09:00.756 --> 00:09:03.926
And a top hat...

163
00:09:03.992 --> 00:09:05.327
to intrigue people

164
00:09:05.427 --> 00:09:09.498
into allowing him in
to show his products.


165
00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:13.569
He's unusual-looking,
I would say.


166
00:09:13.635 --> 00:09:16.138
He reminded me of Willy Wonka.

167
00:09:16.238 --> 00:09:19.241
Ty Warner never
sold to the big stores,


168
00:09:19.308 --> 00:09:22.511
no Wal-Marts, no Kmarts
or anything like that.


169
00:09:22.611 --> 00:09:26.415
We think he's making a mistake.
We're America's toy store.


170
00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:29.685
Why not have your product
in our stores?


171
00:09:29.785 --> 00:09:32.354
It was a big thing for him - 'do
not sell to the majors' -


172
00:09:32.454 --> 00:09:35.424
the reason being is they will
take your product


173
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:36.925
and they will put it on sale,

174
00:09:36.992 --> 00:09:40.295
and they'll destroy the market
for the little guys.


175
00:09:40.362 --> 00:09:42.264
Ty was all about
the small retailers.


176
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:43.765
He loved the small retailers.

177
00:09:43.832 --> 00:09:46.668
He found them to be very, very
faithful to him


178
00:09:46.768 --> 00:09:48.470
and we found the same.

179
00:09:49.938 --> 00:09:55.110
The Beanie Babies,
initially, they were not moving.


180
00:09:55.177 --> 00:09:59.548
It was very difficult to get
retailers to take that plunge


181
00:09:59.648 --> 00:10:01.617
to even try Beanie Babies.

182
00:10:01.683 --> 00:10:05.220
Taking a look at the holiday
season's hottest toys.


183
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.722
What's THE hottest toy
this year?


184
00:10:06.822 --> 00:10:09.458
Probably Tickle Me Elmo
and Nintendo 64.


185
00:10:09.525 --> 00:10:11.026
So then I was sort of thinking,

186
00:10:11.126 --> 00:10:13.662
"What would make a consumer
walk into a store,"


187
00:10:13.729 --> 00:10:18.534
look at this wall of plush and
choose this particular piece?


188
00:10:18.634 --> 00:10:22.171
And I was thinking that there
needs to be a way


189
00:10:22.237 --> 00:10:25.007
where it connects to people.

190
00:10:26.508 --> 00:10:28.877
The thought just randomly
popped into my head


191
00:10:28.977 --> 00:10:31.213
that we should do poems,
that would be kind of cute.


192
00:10:31.313 --> 00:10:34.082
So immediately upon
getting the thought,


193
00:10:34.183 --> 00:10:35.584
I just walked into Ty's office

194
00:10:35.684 --> 00:10:36.828
'cause Ty happened to be there

195
00:10:36.852 --> 00:10:39.555
and I told him,
I said "I have this idea."


196
00:10:39.655 --> 00:10:42.424
So he said, "You think you could
write one for all of them?"


197
00:10:42.524 --> 00:10:46.161
"And can you fax me
the poems in 18 hours?"


198
00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:48.363
There was, like, 80
or so at the time -


199
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.400
87, I think,
that I had to write.


200
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.602
My sister, she's
a visionary woman.


201
00:10:53.702 --> 00:10:59.107
She's ambitious, she has the
ability to think really big.


202
00:10:59.208 --> 00:11:00.448
And to actually make it happen.

203
00:11:00.542 --> 00:11:04.446
Oh, my God. Look at
that... That is so old.


204
00:11:04.546 --> 00:11:08.050
This area is where we wrote
most of the poems.


205
00:11:08.116 --> 00:11:09.117
Right.

206
00:11:09.218 --> 00:11:11.887
"Legs lives in a hollow log.

207
00:11:11.954 --> 00:11:14.389
"Legs likes to play leapfrog.

208
00:11:14.456 --> 00:11:18.460
"If you like to hang out
at the lake"


209
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.463
"Legs will be the one friend
you'll make."


210
00:11:21.563 --> 00:11:25.634
I didn't read it right.
I didn't read it very well.


211
00:11:25.734 --> 00:11:28.370
Bongo's a monkey
that lived in a tree.


212
00:11:28.437 --> 00:11:30.973
"He's the happiest monkey
you'll ever see.


213
00:11:31.073 --> 00:11:33.909
"In his spare time,
he plays the guitar."


214
00:11:33.976 --> 00:11:37.279
"One of these days,
he's gonna be a big star."


215
00:11:39.548 --> 00:11:43.819
It was a toy to play with.
To pretend with.


216
00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:47.756
My daughter was buying one
a week with her allowance money.


217
00:11:47.823 --> 00:11:50.926
You came to notice them
in the Chicago area,


218
00:11:50.993 --> 00:11:52.828
you started to seek them out,

219
00:11:52.928 --> 00:11:56.632
seek more places,
seek more variations.


220
00:11:56.732 --> 00:11:59.768
You know, it started
with my daughter Michelle.


221
00:11:59.835 --> 00:12:02.838
Michelle got excited about it
so I got excited about it.


222
00:12:02.938 --> 00:12:04.106
I told my mom about it,

223
00:12:04.172 --> 00:12:06.084
said "Hey, I'd really like
to collect some of these."


224
00:12:06.108 --> 00:12:09.978
"Can you help me out?"

225
00:12:10.078 --> 00:12:12.981
I have such good memories of
her and I together


226
00:12:13.081 --> 00:12:16.251
racing around looking
for the newer Beanie Babies,


227
00:12:16.318 --> 00:12:18.287
the rarer Beanie Babies.

228
00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:21.757
If there was one
that you wanted,


229
00:12:21.823 --> 00:12:23.125
you had to go look for them

230
00:12:23.191 --> 00:12:24.969
and there was not an easy way
to look for them


231
00:12:24.993 --> 00:12:27.829
'cause they were only
in small stores.


232
00:12:27.929 --> 00:12:30.832
So you had to just sort
of drive around.


233
00:12:32.267 --> 00:12:35.470
So it was like being on
a perennial scavenger hunt.


234
00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:40.208
Ty was not giving us any
information whatsoever.


235
00:12:40.309 --> 00:12:41.510
It was a blank slate.

236
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.712
We had no idea
what was available,


237
00:12:43.812 --> 00:12:46.381
how many were available,
when they were produced,


238
00:12:46.481 --> 00:12:51.019
we had to find this
all out on our own.


239
00:12:52.487 --> 00:12:56.391
What we did was we would take
every Beanie,


240
00:12:56.491 --> 00:13:00.629
list the dates
that they were introduced.


241
00:13:00.696 --> 00:13:02.497
So this is our first attempt

242
00:13:02.564 --> 00:13:06.134
at putting our beanie
chronology together.


243
00:13:07.836 --> 00:13:09.705
After a while,
though, we started saying,


244
00:13:09.805 --> 00:13:13.742
"Well, there must be a finite
number of these things."


245
00:13:13.842 --> 00:13:16.745
And having that
collector's mentality,


246
00:13:16.845 --> 00:13:20.349
you wanted to check them off
a list and have all of them.


247
00:13:26.154 --> 00:13:30.392
From there on, it became
a multiple trip, do what we can,


248
00:13:30.492 --> 00:13:31.569
keep going until you were tired,

249
00:13:31.593 --> 00:13:34.429
until there were no other
stores in the area


250
00:13:34.529 --> 00:13:36.531
that might have what
we're looking for.


251
00:13:36.598 --> 00:13:40.936
And then my mom took
that to an extreme


252
00:13:41.036 --> 00:13:44.206
and it quickly became
her thing over mine.


253
00:13:46.441 --> 00:13:48.210
I am afraid to say that I was

254
00:13:48.276 --> 00:13:52.280
actually the one
that got so intense


255
00:13:52.381 --> 00:13:56.385
and then it became
almost an obsession.


256
00:13:59.554 --> 00:14:02.691
This is how this
collecting craze happened.


257
00:14:02.758 --> 00:14:04.626
It happened by accident.

258
00:14:04.726 --> 00:14:07.462
By parents, mothers, basically

259
00:14:07.562 --> 00:14:12.534
collecting these
for their children.


260
00:14:12.601 --> 00:14:16.204
I am Peggy Gallagher.
I am from the Chicago area.


261
00:14:16.271 --> 00:14:20.041
I have been a Beanie Baby
collector for many, many years.


262
00:14:20.108 --> 00:14:22.911
Since day one.

263
00:14:22.978 --> 00:14:27.983
Paula, who was my younger sister
and a physician at the time,


264
00:14:28.083 --> 00:14:29.394
she found them in
the hospital gift shop.


265
00:14:29.418 --> 00:14:34.656
She opened the bag
and I go, "Oh!"


266
00:14:34.756 --> 00:14:39.060
"Well, I want that one, and that
one, and that one."


267
00:14:39.127 --> 00:14:40.729
Totally love at first sight.

268
00:14:40.796 --> 00:14:43.999
I thought they were the cutest
things that were ever created.


269
00:14:44.099 --> 00:14:45.500
And the names, 
I love the names.

270
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.938
And I just would giggle.
I mean, I STILL giggle.


271
00:14:51.273 --> 00:14:53.141
They are cute.

272
00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:56.812
No. I have stepchildren.

273
00:14:58.613 --> 00:14:59.181
They were not.

274
00:14:59.281 --> 00:15:01.183
No, they were not.

275
00:15:03.752 --> 00:15:06.855
Peggy Toy, how are you?

276
00:15:06.955 --> 00:15:09.191
I'm here to go shopping
for Beanie Babies.


277
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:10.992
Did you bring the cash?

278
00:15:11.092 --> 00:15:12.961
When I started collecting
the Beanie Babies,


279
00:15:13.028 --> 00:15:16.031
I had just
recently gotten married.


280
00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:17.966
I was hiding them
because I thought


281
00:15:18.033 --> 00:15:19.510
my new husband's
gonna think I'm crazy


282
00:15:19.534 --> 00:15:22.204
buying these
little stuffed toys.


283
00:15:22.304 --> 00:15:25.440
So I'd hide them upstairs
in that office.


284
00:15:25.507 --> 00:15:26.708
And then finally,

285
00:15:26.808 --> 00:15:29.845
I told him about this collection
that I'd been hiding


286
00:15:29.945 --> 00:15:32.347
and I showed him
and he couldn't believe it.


287
00:15:32.447 --> 00:15:36.885
He just said, "Do you collect
all these toys all the time?"


288
00:15:36.985 --> 00:15:39.654
I was like a normal person.

289
00:15:39.721 --> 00:15:42.457
And here I am not acting normal.

290
00:15:43.391 --> 00:15:44.826
He was a little shocked.

291
00:15:44.893 --> 00:15:46.127
He was a Porsche person

292
00:15:46.194 --> 00:15:48.830
so he kept collecting cars
and Mercedes,


293
00:15:48.897 --> 00:15:52.501
so he had to be a little
empathetic because his toys


294
00:15:52.567 --> 00:15:56.538
were a lot more
expensive than mine.


295
00:15:58.173 --> 00:16:01.676
It was evident very early that
you couldn't get


296
00:16:01.743 --> 00:16:03.144
all the Beanie Babies

297
00:16:03.211 --> 00:16:07.649
by just going to different
stores in your local area.


298
00:16:07.716 --> 00:16:12.087
So then started another phase
of my collecting


299
00:16:12.187 --> 00:16:14.990
which was going outside
of your state


300
00:16:15.056 --> 00:16:17.893
to find the ones
you didn't yet have


301
00:16:17.993 --> 00:16:20.829
that you really needed, right?

302
00:16:20.896 --> 00:16:24.232
We called Ty
and they gave us some stores


303
00:16:24.332 --> 00:16:26.001
that they were available in.

304
00:16:26.067 --> 00:16:28.103
And so we started
calling those stores


305
00:16:28.203 --> 00:16:29.604
and then what we would do

306
00:16:29.704 --> 00:16:32.874
is say, "OK, do you know any
other gift shops in your area?"


307
00:16:38.346 --> 00:16:40.081
You're gonna
have to wait for a second, OK?


308
00:16:40.181 --> 00:16:41.883
Then we called
the Chamber of Commerce


309
00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:47.055
in those cities, and they would
tell us all the gift shops.


310
00:16:47.122 --> 00:16:50.792
We called every shop
over the United States.


311
00:16:50.892 --> 00:16:56.298
Our phone bills for one month
were almost $2000.


312
00:16:58.767 --> 00:17:01.570
So now you're creating a market

313
00:17:01.636 --> 00:17:06.107
innocently by women calling
all over the United States.


314
00:17:06.207 --> 00:17:07.542
I wasn't the only one.

315
00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:10.312
You got Becky from Naperville,

316
00:17:10.412 --> 00:17:13.648
buying Beanie Babies,
paying with a credit card,


317
00:17:13.748 --> 00:17:15.083
shipping them all.

318
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.986
Mary Beth Sobolewski.
She was one.


319
00:17:18.086 --> 00:17:19.888
Gift shop owners,
they would even say to me,


320
00:17:19.955 --> 00:17:24.092
"There's these women in
Naperville..." I said, "Becky?"


321
00:17:24.159 --> 00:17:25.927
And they knew the names,
they go "Oh, yes",


322
00:17:25.994 --> 00:17:27.596
"we just ran her credit card."

323
00:17:27.662 --> 00:17:30.932
"and I thought, they cleaned me
out before I got to them."


324
00:17:30.999 --> 00:17:33.101
I never felt like
there was a competition


325
00:17:33.168 --> 00:17:34.936
between the other collectors.

326
00:17:35.003 --> 00:17:37.005
No, it was plenty of room
for everybody.


327
00:17:37.105 --> 00:17:40.475
We didn't get along, there was
a lot of competition, you know?


328
00:17:40.575 --> 00:17:43.445
And women are the worst.

329
00:17:43.511 --> 00:17:46.481
I'd deal with men any time,
women and... Oh, my gosh.


330
00:17:46.581 --> 00:17:49.317
Yeah, there was competition.

331
00:17:49.417 --> 00:17:50.928
One of the real sleepers
in the industry this year,


332
00:17:50.952 --> 00:17:53.755
these cute little animals
called the Beanie Babies


333
00:17:53.822 --> 00:17:57.859
from an unknown company
called Ty Toys.


334
00:17:57.959 --> 00:18:00.328
It was going here in Chicago,

335
00:18:00.428 --> 00:18:04.032
but it hadn't really hit
nationally as much yet.


336
00:18:04.132 --> 00:18:05.266
We had about a year before

337
00:18:05.333 --> 00:18:09.170
people started finding out
about Beanie Babies.


338
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.539
The kids like them so if
he keeps them happy,


339
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.874
that's why I buy them.

340
00:18:12.974 --> 00:18:18.046
It was steady growth until Ty
had the article


341
00:18:18.146 --> 00:18:19.681
in 'People Magazine'.

342
00:18:19.781 --> 00:18:23.018
I'm the only journalist
who ever interviewed Ty Warner


343
00:18:23.118 --> 00:18:24.486
about Beanie Babies.

344
00:18:25.153 --> 00:18:26.597
In those days, if
'People Magazine' was calling,


345
00:18:26.621 --> 00:18:29.491
people wanted to talk to you
because they knew the magazine.


346
00:18:29.557 --> 00:18:30.792
If I think back,

347
00:18:31.192 --> 00:18:34.062
I just kind of remember him
being almost like a young child


348
00:18:34.162 --> 00:18:36.865
showing you things, you know?

349
00:18:36.965 --> 00:18:39.034
Like, "Look here and look
what we did here!"


350
00:18:39.134 --> 00:18:41.336
and he was just very,
very proud of what he'd done.


351
00:18:41.403 --> 00:18:44.172
Ah! Here we go.

352
00:18:44.239 --> 00:18:45.907
"Ty Warner's Beanie Babies"

353
00:18:46.007 --> 00:18:47.642
"are the new gotta-have toys."

354
00:18:49.044 --> 00:18:50.478
He didn't want to be the story,

355
00:18:50.545 --> 00:18:52.747
he wanted the toys
to be the story,


356
00:18:52.847 --> 00:18:53.481
and they certainly were.

357
00:18:53.548 --> 00:18:57.085
Ty Warner and Ty Inc.

358
00:18:57.185 --> 00:19:02.924
Did absolutely no advertising
and they did no media.


359
00:19:03.024 --> 00:19:05.060
There was nothing
that came from the company.


360
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.097
People wanted someone who was
associated with Beanie Babies


361
00:19:09.197 --> 00:19:10.432
to connect with.

362
00:19:10.532 --> 00:19:12.233
It goes from the child
to the parents


363
00:19:12.333 --> 00:19:14.936
to the aunts and uncles
and grandparents.


364
00:19:15.036 --> 00:19:16.104
So we would have people

365
00:19:16.204 --> 00:19:19.407
from magazines and
radio shows calling us,


366
00:19:19.507 --> 00:19:24.446
so we became the Beanie Baby
advocates for collectors.


367
00:19:24.546 --> 00:19:27.215
The brand-new current ones
are really hot demand


368
00:19:27.282 --> 00:19:29.117
right here in the Chicago area.

369
00:19:29.217 --> 00:19:31.119
This is actually where
the craze began.


370
00:19:31.219 --> 00:19:35.390
I can say, hey, I think Becky
and I and Peggy and Mary Beth


371
00:19:35.457 --> 00:19:36.958
really did a lot for it Ty

372
00:19:37.058 --> 00:19:40.395
to get this moving
in the right direction.


373
00:19:48.636 --> 00:19:51.306
Open any newspaper
to the classified ads


374
00:19:51.406 --> 00:19:53.475
and you're likely to find
at least a half-dozen ads


375
00:19:53.575 --> 00:19:57.445
from people selling, buying
or trading Beanie Babies.


376
00:19:57.545 --> 00:20:00.215
Each day, they come
to Hamilton Place Mall


377
00:20:00.281 --> 00:20:02.150
searching for these -
Beanie Babies.


378
00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.486
I think the girls
really liked it at first


379
00:20:04.586 --> 00:20:07.989
but now I think the adults
have got into it, you know?


380
00:20:09.424 --> 00:20:11.459
This was supposed to be a toy

381
00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:13.279
and we were all having
a lot of fun with it,


382
00:20:13.328 --> 00:20:16.331
but now it's moving
into a different realm.


383
00:20:16.431 --> 00:20:17.665
What is a Beanie Baby?

384
00:20:17.766 --> 00:20:21.503
It's a beanbag toy
meant to be played with.


385
00:20:22.837 --> 00:20:25.673
My name is Harry Rinker,
and during my career,


386
00:20:25.774 --> 00:20:28.243
I was
known as the Beanie Meanie.


387
00:20:30.178 --> 00:20:33.281
What makes The Beanie Baby come
alive is the secondary market.


388
00:20:33.348 --> 00:20:35.483
Not the primary market
where it first is sold,


389
00:20:35.583 --> 00:20:38.520
but what happens to it when
somebody tries to resell it.


390
00:20:40.021 --> 00:20:41.289
Kids started demanding

391
00:20:41.356 --> 00:20:43.158
that their parents
buy Beanie Babies for them


392
00:20:43.258 --> 00:20:44.826
because their friends had them.

393
00:20:44.926 --> 00:20:46.327
Parents said "Oh, my gosh",

394
00:20:46.427 --> 00:20:48.139
"I need to get that
this Beanie Baby for my kids,"


395
00:20:48.163 --> 00:20:50.003
and they went to the store
and it wasn't there,


396
00:20:50.031 --> 00:20:51.175
so then they went onto
the secondary market,


397
00:20:51.199 --> 00:20:54.035
the newspaper columns and
all the rest of them


398
00:20:54.135 --> 00:20:56.704
and they paid double,
triple, quadruple.


399
00:21:03.311 --> 00:21:05.446
Essentially, with any bubble,
what it starts with


400
00:21:05.513 --> 00:21:09.117
is enthusiasm
from a small group.


401
00:21:11.553 --> 00:21:13.788
I'm Dave Sobolewski,

402
00:21:13.855 --> 00:21:16.457
I am the middle child
of Mary Beth Sobolewski,


403
00:21:16.524 --> 00:21:19.327
one of the original
Beanie Ladies.


404
00:21:20.995 --> 00:21:26.901
So my background, my education,
my profession, it's all finance.


405
00:21:28.336 --> 00:21:30.405
You know, Beanie Babies
is a case study


406
00:21:30.505 --> 00:21:37.412
in just how a few people
pushing an idea and enthusiasm,


407
00:21:37.512 --> 00:21:39.180
crazy things can happen.

408
00:21:42.717 --> 00:21:46.421
Well, they started lining up at

409
00:21:46.521 --> 00:21:49.991
for our 8 o'clock sale,
so they waited about 18.5 hours.


410
00:21:50.058 --> 00:21:52.694
- Have you got them all?
- Yeah. All of them.


411
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.229
- And more.
- And more.


412
00:21:54.329 --> 00:21:56.364
- Oh, it gets worse.
- All of them and more.


413
00:21:56.431 --> 00:21:59.334
OK. Well, you made
it hard, didn't you?


414
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.238
You know, you have...

415
00:22:07.709 --> 00:22:13.414
Oh, I think Jeannine Twardus,
she was over the edge.


416
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:18.253
I had wrote a song,
'It's a Beanie Rap',


417
00:22:18.353 --> 00:22:21.589
and the words just flowed
through my fingers


418
00:22:21.689 --> 00:22:24.959
as I typed them into a computer.

419
00:22:25.059 --> 00:22:26.628
People have told me it's catchy.

420
00:22:30.732 --> 00:22:32.209
Let me tell you a story
about a guy named Ty


421
00:22:32.233 --> 00:22:34.202
He created these beanies that
make me high


422
00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:37.572
Little beans in their bodies
and cute little faces


423
00:22:37.639 --> 00:22:39.283
I'm addicted to them
been to all kinds of places


424
00:22:39.307 --> 00:22:42.143
Smuggling beanies upstairs
It's no lie


425
00:22:42.243 --> 00:22:44.312
And I blame it all on a guy
named Ty


426
00:22:44.412 --> 00:22:49.117
It's a beanie rap
It's a beanie rap


427
00:22:49.217 --> 00:22:51.119
It's a beanie rap

428
00:22:51.219 --> 00:22:54.289
I'm all tied up.

429
00:22:54.389 --> 00:22:58.226
I actually sold some in my
store and on the Internet.


430
00:22:58.293 --> 00:23:02.463
I even tried sending a copy
to a local radio station


431
00:23:02.563 --> 00:23:04.265
but they never played it.

432
00:23:04.332 --> 00:23:07.268
Back in the 1990s,
I was in the Navy.


433
00:23:07.335 --> 00:23:09.103
I was a cryptological
technician.


434
00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:12.941
When I left the Navy,
I was working for a bank


435
00:23:13.007 --> 00:23:15.944
and then I worked at the FBI
for three years.


436
00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:17.312
Like...

437
00:23:17.412 --> 00:23:20.848
"Do I want to do this for
the rest of my life?" You know?


438
00:23:20.949 --> 00:23:23.785
And so I eventually
left the FBI.


439
00:23:23.851 --> 00:23:26.254
I'm all tied up.

440
00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:31.926
I think it was around '96,
'cause AOL just had come out.


441
00:23:31.993 --> 00:23:34.095
You've got mail!

442
00:23:34.162 --> 00:23:37.165
And I saw an article about
Beanie Babies


443
00:23:37.265 --> 00:23:38.466
in a Chicago newspaper.

444
00:23:38.533 --> 00:23:42.136
And it described how people
were both going crazy


445
00:23:42.203 --> 00:23:44.014
over these little animals and
I got on the Internet


446
00:23:44.038 --> 00:23:46.674
to see if anybody else was
collecting them


447
00:23:46.774 --> 00:23:50.845
and back then, they
had little chat rooms on AOL,


448
00:23:50.945 --> 00:23:53.614
and it was not formalised like
it is now in the Internet world,


449
00:23:53.681 --> 00:23:55.016
it was very rudimentary.

450
00:23:55.116 --> 00:23:57.452
Can you believe
what's possible these days?


451
00:23:57.518 --> 00:23:58.987
Conversations through
your computer!


452
00:23:59.053 --> 00:24:02.490
Worlds of information
one click away.


453
00:24:02.557 --> 00:24:03.491
Everyone I know is on it.

454
00:24:03.558 --> 00:24:05.126
- Email.
- Instant messages.


455
00:24:05.193 --> 00:24:06.728
There's no better way
to keep in touch.


456
00:24:06.828 --> 00:24:08.329
You've got mail.

457
00:24:14.135 --> 00:24:16.537
It was, like, a very
characteristic sound


458
00:24:16.637 --> 00:24:18.806
of logging onto
the Internet in the '90s.


459
00:24:18.873 --> 00:24:21.976
And you could hear it through
the whole house!


460
00:24:25.513 --> 00:24:27.181
I went to Ty and I told him

461
00:24:27.248 --> 00:24:30.084
there's this thing
called the Internet.


462
00:24:30.184 --> 00:24:34.989
If we build something that has
a list of all of our products


463
00:24:35.056 --> 00:24:36.157
and a guestbook,

464
00:24:36.224 --> 00:24:38.059
just like you would
think at a wedding,


465
00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:39.303
when you have
a guestbook at a wedding,


466
00:24:39.327 --> 00:24:43.698
and he asked a bunch
of questions, I remember,


467
00:24:43.765 --> 00:24:46.501
and said, "Let's build this",

468
00:24:46.567 --> 00:24:48.770
"this might be something
cool to build."


469
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:50.838
Would you believe Beanie Babies

470
00:24:50.905 --> 00:24:52.940
have their own website?

471
00:24:53.041 --> 00:24:56.611
And that was when
the journey began.


472
00:24:56.711 --> 00:24:59.047
Jillian and Reed
regularly go on the Internet.


473
00:24:59.113 --> 00:25:00.181
We go on the Internet

474
00:25:00.248 --> 00:25:03.084
and we go to what they call
the guestbook...


475
00:25:03.184 --> 00:25:06.554
It was maybe one of
the first blogs


476
00:25:06.621 --> 00:25:08.256
that ever existed
on the Internet.


477
00:25:08.356 --> 00:25:12.093
As maybe a predecessor to the
sentiments that early Facebook


478
00:25:12.193 --> 00:25:13.461
was asking for people to share

479
00:25:13.561 --> 00:25:15.205
"what are you doing right
now in this moment?"


480
00:25:15.229 --> 00:25:17.799
You can see it
has Beanie Baby games,


481
00:25:17.899 --> 00:25:19.100
it has a list with graphics

482
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.803
and also a text version
of the list.


483
00:25:21.903 --> 00:25:25.106
That was so far ahead, it's only
in looking back,


484
00:25:25.206 --> 00:25:30.445
that you see,
"Wow, they were really early."


485
00:25:30.545 --> 00:25:32.814
But this is the Ty one that
we're going to see first.


486
00:25:32.914 --> 00:25:34.482
It's the mother of all of them.

487
00:25:34.582 --> 00:25:35.249
Let's take a look at that.

488
00:25:35.316 --> 00:25:38.319
- Mm-hm.
- Not many hits.


489
00:25:38.419 --> 00:25:40.221
Look at the number of hits.
Back up.


490
00:25:40.288 --> 00:25:41.989
Oh, my God.

491
00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:43.658
Over 1 billion hits.

492
00:25:45.259 --> 00:25:46.961
The page was constantly crashing

493
00:25:47.061 --> 00:25:51.232
because of the amount
of traffic that it was getting.


494
00:25:51.299 --> 00:25:52.800
This craze never
would've happened


495
00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.268
if there wasn't an Internet.

496
00:25:54.335 --> 00:25:55.636
But the Internet
in and of itself


497
00:25:55.736 --> 00:26:00.608
was not enough to make
Beanie Babies what they became.


498
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:04.445
On the guestbook, Ty Warner
allows us


499
00:26:04.512 --> 00:26:07.982
to talk to each
other about the Beanie Babies


500
00:26:08.082 --> 00:26:09.317
and to sell Beanie Babies.

501
00:26:09.417 --> 00:26:13.154
Now you've got people
from America Online


502
00:26:13.254 --> 00:26:15.823
trying to hook up with people

503
00:26:15.923 --> 00:26:18.526
that are buying
and selling Beanie Babies.


504
00:26:18.626 --> 00:26:22.763
"Here, if you want this, I can
sell it to you for 25 bucks."


505
00:26:31.539 --> 00:26:32.940
Beanie Babies would go
to production


506
00:26:33.007 --> 00:26:36.777
and they'd be in production
for a certain amount of time...


507
00:26:36.844 --> 00:26:38.379
Suddenly, they weren't able

508
00:26:38.479 --> 00:26:40.715
to make a particular
one of the Beanies


509
00:26:40.815 --> 00:26:44.886
or the fabric ran out or they
just couldn't get that shipment


510
00:26:44.986 --> 00:26:48.623
and they found when a particular
item was less available,


511
00:26:48.689 --> 00:26:50.224
that people wanted it more.

512
00:26:50.324 --> 00:26:52.393
I don't think he
did that on purpose.


513
00:26:52.493 --> 00:26:55.663
I think it was just a fluke
and the collectors caught it.


514
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.165
Bob Howard picked up

515
00:26:57.231 --> 00:26:58.308
three new retirees
for his grandson.


516
00:26:58.332 --> 00:27:01.502
He chose Rover, Ziggy
and Squealer.


517
00:27:01.569 --> 00:27:03.905
Ty wanted to capitalise on that

518
00:27:04.005 --> 00:27:07.341
and not just quietly
let one of the beanies retire,


519
00:27:07.408 --> 00:27:09.744
but to actually start
letting people know.


520
00:27:15.183 --> 00:27:20.254
Two weeks before January, 1997,

521
00:27:20.354 --> 00:27:24.492
Ty closes down his website.

522
00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:27.828
And he puts a clock
on the website.


523
00:27:31.933 --> 00:27:33.201
So we're all waiting.

524
00:27:33.267 --> 00:27:37.905
And then, all of a sudden,
January 1...


525
00:27:39.407 --> 00:27:41.275
he tells us all
about the beanie babies


526
00:27:41.375 --> 00:27:42.910
that were going to be retired.

527
00:27:44.545 --> 00:27:46.013
So you had people in stores

528
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.884
so they can go and pick them up
before they're all gone.


529
00:27:49.951 --> 00:27:52.286
It was like you didn't
want to miss out.


530
00:27:52.386 --> 00:27:55.223
Mom, I want this one!

531
00:27:55.289 --> 00:27:58.526
Behind all this
is a carefully crafted strategy,


532
00:27:58.593 --> 00:28:02.630
add one new beanie
to the market, and take one away


533
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.265
and one by one

534
00:28:04.365 --> 00:28:07.368
the beanies move into
the Endangered Species category.


535
00:28:10.071 --> 00:28:11.906
The collectors loved it.

536
00:28:11.973 --> 00:28:14.575
Nothing to spark
a collector's interest


537
00:28:14.642 --> 00:28:17.111
more than
"You can't have it anymore."


538
00:28:17.211 --> 00:28:19.647
So then people now are going in

539
00:28:19.747 --> 00:28:22.650
and if they see one of
the ones they've just retired,


540
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:23.651
they buy the whole bunch.

541
00:28:23.751 --> 00:28:25.553
Once they retire them,

542
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.887
they become very hard to get?

543
00:28:26.954 --> 00:28:28.122
Exactly.

544
00:28:29.757 --> 00:28:32.393
Well, then what you saw
with Beanie Babies


545
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.161
is the supply went even lower,

546
00:28:34.262 --> 00:28:37.231
as these beanies
kept getting retired.


547
00:28:37.298 --> 00:28:40.434
So then you've got demand
going way higher.


548
00:28:40.501 --> 00:28:43.838
So prices will rise.

549
00:28:44.939 --> 00:28:46.941
You see how the psychology

550
00:28:47.008 --> 00:28:49.810
of both Ty Warner
and the collectors


551
00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:53.781
played hand-in-hand
to really fuel this mania.


552
00:28:53.848 --> 00:28:55.750
What happens to a Beanie Baby

553
00:28:55.816 --> 00:28:56.896
once a Beanie Baby retires?

554
00:28:56.951 --> 00:28:59.820
- The price of it goes up.
- No kidding!


555
00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:05.159
$350, $450, $900.

556
00:29:05.259 --> 00:29:07.762
The prices went up and
up and up.


557
00:29:07.828 --> 00:29:09.964
A complete collection
of Beanie Babies


558
00:29:10.031 --> 00:29:12.166
could go as high as $100,000.

559
00:29:12.266 --> 00:29:16.037
Somebody offered me
$100,000 dollars.


560
00:29:16.137 --> 00:29:19.307
$100,000. 20 years ago, right?

561
00:29:19.373 --> 00:29:21.142
I said no.

562
00:29:21.208 --> 00:29:23.711
In comes the people who
said "They're an investment."


563
00:29:23.811 --> 00:29:28.949
"I can buy Beanie Babies and
send my kids through college."


564
00:29:29.016 --> 00:29:31.285
This was becoming
something different.


565
00:29:31.352 --> 00:29:33.287
We don't play with these things

566
00:29:33.354 --> 00:29:35.189
because they're going
to be worth money.


567
00:29:35.289 --> 00:29:41.128
If the tag was creased, you'd
ruin the value of your beanie.


568
00:29:41.195 --> 00:29:45.032
People were starting to do it
for financial investment.


569
00:29:45.132 --> 00:29:47.568
There were the collectors

570
00:29:47.668 --> 00:29:49.970
that made it into a business

571
00:29:50.037 --> 00:29:52.640
and there were others
that weren't collectors at all


572
00:29:52.707 --> 00:29:54.241
that just made it a business.

573
00:29:54.342 --> 00:29:57.144
I call myself
the monkey in the middle.


574
00:30:01.682 --> 00:30:03.651
My name is Phyllis Miceli.

575
00:30:03.718 --> 00:30:08.255
I've been known as
Queenie Beanie for 20 years.


576
00:30:08.356 --> 00:30:10.324
I didn't collect 'em,
I sold 'em.


577
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:12.426
I was crazy about the money in
the bank,


578
00:30:12.526 --> 00:30:14.428
not about the Beanie Babies.

579
00:30:16.764 --> 00:30:18.999
I sold to accountants,

580
00:30:19.066 --> 00:30:22.903
actuaries, airplane pilots,

581
00:30:23.003 --> 00:30:27.007
they were all
into Beanie Babies.


582
00:30:28.843 --> 00:30:30.244
A gentleman emailed me

583
00:30:30.344 --> 00:30:32.546
and he said, "Can you handle
a large account?"


584
00:30:32.613 --> 00:30:35.683
And I said, "No problem.
Send me the money."


585
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:43.750
And he sent me $20,000.
To buy Beanie Babies for him.


586
00:30:46.093 --> 00:30:50.798
He was stationed
in the Marines in Hawaii.


587
00:30:50.898 --> 00:30:53.033
I didn't trust the Beanie Babies

588
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.070
being sent through the mail.

589
00:30:56.137 --> 00:31:01.142
So we hopped on a plane and
handcarried them to Hawaii.


590
00:31:01.242 --> 00:31:06.747
His wife went to the bathroom
and he handed me 20,000 cash.


591
00:31:06.814 --> 00:31:10.284
And he said, "Don't tell my wife
what I paid for these."


592
00:31:12.119 --> 00:31:16.323
My husband and I both thought
it was totally crazy.


593
00:31:16.424 --> 00:31:18.492
And when we got back
to the hotel


594
00:31:18.592 --> 00:31:21.262
I remember we threw
the money on the bed.


595
00:31:28.769 --> 00:31:33.174
First ever international
Beanie Baby convention.


596
00:31:33.274 --> 00:31:34.809
How do you like that?

597
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:37.011
1000 people milled
through the convention centre


598
00:31:37.111 --> 00:31:40.581
to get a closer look
at current and retired Beanies.


599
00:31:52.827 --> 00:31:55.529
I realised
going to the collector shows


600
00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:57.298
that there were people out there

601
00:31:57.364 --> 00:32:01.035
who were buying the beanies
and this was their livelihood.


602
00:32:01.135 --> 00:32:02.837
This was their job.

603
00:32:02.937 --> 00:32:07.041
I know some of them that would
make $30,000 at a show.


604
00:32:08.142 --> 00:32:10.544
And so we started doing
the same thing.


605
00:32:12.146 --> 00:32:16.217
And so we were shipping boxes
of Beanies and selling them.


606
00:32:16.317 --> 00:32:20.788
I would get, like,

607
00:32:20.855 --> 00:32:22.056
I remember thinking,

608
00:32:22.156 --> 00:32:24.558
"I just paid 10 bucks for
each one of these,"


609
00:32:24.658 --> 00:32:28.229
"and my husband said, how much
are you gonna sell these for?"


610
00:32:28.329 --> 00:32:30.064
I said, "$300."

611
00:32:30.164 --> 00:32:32.900
Right away, I'm not good in math

612
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.568
but he's, like, calculating,

613
00:32:34.668 --> 00:32:36.737
"Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!"


614
00:32:36.837 --> 00:32:39.006
He's, like, jumping around.

615
00:32:39.073 --> 00:32:41.175
He thought I was just a genius.

616
00:32:44.879 --> 00:32:47.348
I might have bought
a newer Mercedes.


617
00:32:48.916 --> 00:32:52.820
I had 'B BABIES'
Yeah, I got the plates,


618
00:32:52.887 --> 00:32:54.755
I thought "Oh, my God,
this is so cute."


619
00:32:54.855 --> 00:32:59.026
It was on my Mercedes
and I was proud of that.


620
00:33:00.594 --> 00:33:01.729
Becky Phillips

621
00:33:01.829 --> 00:33:03.163
and Becky Estenssoro
of Naperville


622
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.508
have turned Beanies
into a career.


623
00:33:04.532 --> 00:33:07.167
They've even written a book
called 'Beanie Mania'.


624
00:33:07.234 --> 00:33:09.169
We want to concentrate on the
collectors,


625
00:33:09.236 --> 00:33:11.739
so they know what's available,
so they don't get ripped off.


626
00:33:11.839 --> 00:33:13.440
Out of her home
where she and her husband


627
00:33:13.541 --> 00:33:15.609
are raising several children,

628
00:33:15.709 --> 00:33:17.629
she puts out 'Mary Beth's
Beanie World Magazine'.


629
00:33:17.711 --> 00:33:22.783
A publisher gave me a call
out of the absolute blue


630
00:33:22.883 --> 00:33:25.920
and said, "We would like
to do a magazine"


631
00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.122
"all about Beanie Babies."

632
00:33:28.222 --> 00:33:30.724
By the end of the time
the first issue was out,


633
00:33:30.791 --> 00:33:31.959
they made it a bimonthly.

634
00:33:32.059 --> 00:33:34.562
It just kept going
and going and going.


635
00:33:34.628 --> 00:33:37.765
They're going to be
turning out 600,000 copies


636
00:33:37.865 --> 00:33:38.865
of the May issue.

637
00:33:38.899 --> 00:33:40.801
I couldn't believe it.
I was like,


638
00:33:40.901 --> 00:33:42.736
"Oh, my gosh,
this is my name on here.


639
00:33:42.803 --> 00:33:47.207
"Are you kidding?"
This is just me from suburbia.


640
00:33:47.274 --> 00:33:50.311
I think in the Beanie Baby
world, I was famous.


641
00:33:50.411 --> 00:33:53.714
I was pretty famous.

642
00:33:54.748 --> 00:33:56.150
We all want that one moment

643
00:33:56.250 --> 00:34:00.921
where we feel that maybe
this is just our special time.


644
00:34:05.759 --> 00:34:08.963
Ty did not
manipulate this market.


645
00:34:09.063 --> 00:34:11.832
Let's talk about what it takes
to manipulate a market.


646
00:34:11.932 --> 00:34:14.668
First of all, there needs to be
a secondary market


647
00:34:14.768 --> 00:34:18.672
and a craze -
that we already established.


648
00:34:18.772 --> 00:34:22.843
This is the highest price I have
heard. For $2000 at a show...


649
00:34:22.943 --> 00:34:24.578
Then you need the media,

650
00:34:24.645 --> 00:34:27.414
they're the best suckers to
manipulating a market out there


651
00:34:27.481 --> 00:34:28.916
if you can get them to do it.

652
00:34:28.983 --> 00:34:30.951
There are so many collectors
all around the world,


653
00:34:31.018 --> 00:34:32.853
this, of course,
is a phenomenon.


654
00:34:35.289 --> 00:34:40.828
I got paid to go to England,
I was all over Germany.


655
00:34:40.928 --> 00:34:43.998
You start out with a finite
list of Beanie Babies


656
00:34:44.098 --> 00:34:45.432
where you can check them off.

657
00:34:45.499 --> 00:34:50.170
I was doing so much media,
it was truly 24/7.


658
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:52.673
The books and
magazines explain their worth.


659
00:34:52.773 --> 00:34:55.175
They needed the price guides
that come out.


660
00:35:00.447 --> 00:35:02.816
These ladies that wrote
these price guides


661
00:35:02.883 --> 00:35:04.518
made a lot of
money off of it - why?


662
00:35:04.618 --> 00:35:06.720
Because they raise the price
in every price guide


663
00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:07.998
and people took that as
a price absolute.


664
00:35:08.022 --> 00:35:11.225
People pay hundreds,
even thousands


665
00:35:11.325 --> 00:35:13.560
for hard-to-find beanies
on the secondary market.


666
00:35:13.661 --> 00:35:16.030
But to spend that much money...

667
00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:19.967
The feeling is just very intense
in this collectibles market.


668
00:35:20.034 --> 00:35:21.702
There was such a frenzy.

669
00:35:21.802 --> 00:35:24.471
Oh, gosh!

670
00:35:24.538 --> 00:35:26.907
Just the electricity.

671
00:35:28.842 --> 00:35:30.377
They would just lunge and grab

672
00:35:30.477 --> 00:35:31.788
and somebody was yelling,
"I need, I need,"


673
00:35:31.812 --> 00:35:34.982
and it would
go flying across the store.


674
00:35:38.385 --> 00:35:41.588
You'll start
to do anything you can


675
00:35:41.689 --> 00:35:44.925
to 'complete your collection'.

676
00:35:45.025 --> 00:35:47.995
That's when things
got out of control.


677
00:35:52.833 --> 00:35:55.936
Don't be fooled,
these are not the real thing.


678
00:35:56.036 --> 00:35:58.772
US Customs officers
at O'Hare Airport


679
00:35:58.872 --> 00:36:02.042
confiscated over

680
00:36:02.109 --> 00:36:03.777
People knew they could start

681
00:36:03.877 --> 00:36:04.957
making money on this stuff,

682
00:36:05.045 --> 00:36:06.680
that's when the counterfeits

683
00:36:06.747 --> 00:36:10.718
started oozing
into the environment


684
00:36:10.784 --> 00:36:12.886
and ruining everything.

685
00:36:12.953 --> 00:36:14.888
The stash of cute creatures

686
00:36:14.955 --> 00:36:17.891
was initially mistaken for
a different kind of stash.


687
00:36:17.958 --> 00:36:20.394
We suspected that there
may be narcotics in it.


688
00:36:20.461 --> 00:36:21.671
When the inspectors
opened the boxes,


689
00:36:21.695 --> 00:36:23.797
lo and behold, stuffed animals.

690
00:36:23.897 --> 00:36:25.799
There are some
Beanie Babies out there


691
00:36:25.899 --> 00:36:28.035
that sport a $5000 price tag.

692
00:36:28.102 --> 00:36:29.382
With that kind
of money at stake,


693
00:36:29.436 --> 00:36:33.140
Customs officials say
despite this huge Beanie bust,


694
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.643
keeping fake ones off the street
may be nearly impossible.


695
00:36:36.744 --> 00:36:38.479
We know of several collectors

696
00:36:38.579 --> 00:36:41.982
who lost at least $10,000
or more on Beanies


697
00:36:42.082 --> 00:36:42.883
because they were counterfeit.

698
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:44.785
The first thing that we noticed

699
00:36:44.885 --> 00:36:46.987
when we open the box was
the material.


700
00:36:47.087 --> 00:36:48.822
You can see that the material

701
00:36:48.922 --> 00:36:51.058
on the fake, counterfeit Beanies

702
00:36:51.125 --> 00:36:54.461
are not as plush as the
regular Beanie Babies are.


703
00:36:54.561 --> 00:36:57.831
In the beginning, counterfeit
Beanie Babies,


704
00:36:57.931 --> 00:37:00.834
it was obvious
they were counterfeit.


705
00:37:02.269 --> 00:37:05.172
But then they were starting to
look better and better


706
00:37:05.272 --> 00:37:08.008
so that is when you had people

707
00:37:08.108 --> 00:37:10.110
like Peggy Gallagher

708
00:37:10.177 --> 00:37:13.947
starting to do authentication
of beanies.


709
00:37:14.014 --> 00:37:16.350
They are picking
these up for 70c


710
00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:17.584
but these are rejects,

711
00:37:17.651 --> 00:37:19.486
these are not the authentic Ty
Beanie Babies.


712
00:37:19.586 --> 00:37:21.321
- So they're frauds?
- They are frauds.


713
00:37:21.421 --> 00:37:23.524
They were coming from Beijing

714
00:37:23.624 --> 00:37:26.593
and the people in China knew
that these Americans are crazy,


715
00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.195
they're paying all this money...

716
00:37:28.295 --> 00:37:31.098
Well, of course they're gonna
start counterfeiting them!


717
00:37:31.165 --> 00:37:32.800
'Cause there gonna
make a fortune


718
00:37:32.866 --> 00:37:35.106
because these people don't even
know what they look like.


719
00:37:35.135 --> 00:37:39.540
You know what, you have
a service that you offer.


720
00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:40.841
Yes - on my website,

721
00:37:40.941 --> 00:37:43.477
I have the first
authenticating business


722
00:37:43.544 --> 00:37:45.846
for Beanie Babies.

723
00:37:45.946 --> 00:37:49.683
People were sending these
to me from all over the country,


724
00:37:49.783 --> 00:37:51.285
and I think I charged 20 bucks

725
00:37:51.351 --> 00:37:53.720
and then I started
getting a lot of competition


726
00:37:53.821 --> 00:37:57.124
but I was still the main one.

727
00:37:57.191 --> 00:38:00.394
They knew they could trust me.

728
00:38:00.494 --> 00:38:05.065
So that has a lot
to do with my success.


729
00:38:07.701 --> 00:38:09.236
For a little item,

730
00:38:09.336 --> 00:38:11.405
it's amazing how much
of a back story there is.


731
00:38:11.505 --> 00:38:13.407
You can't even imagine.

732
00:38:15.843 --> 00:38:17.244
Initially, I don't even remember

733
00:38:17.344 --> 00:38:19.646
having a title at the time -
it was just sales,


734
00:38:19.713 --> 00:38:21.148
and then, within six months,

735
00:38:21.215 --> 00:38:24.751
he had asked me to become
general manager for the company.


736
00:38:31.091 --> 00:38:33.527
It seems so much smaller
than I remember.


737
00:38:34.862 --> 00:38:35.696
We were all young at the time,

738
00:38:35.762 --> 00:38:38.232
and everyone was open to change.

739
00:38:38.332 --> 00:38:40.033
So I think that
was really exciting


740
00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:43.403
to be able to hit the dragon's
tail and it actually moved.


741
00:38:47.374 --> 00:38:51.745
It was insane. You couldn't get
through on the phone.


742
00:38:51.845 --> 00:38:54.281
Ty was very frustrated when
he couldn't get through.


743
00:38:54.381 --> 00:38:56.783
So he installed we called it
the bat phone.


744
00:38:56.884 --> 00:38:58.452
The big red phone.

745
00:38:58.552 --> 00:39:02.756
If that rang, whoever was there
had to run and get the phone.


746
00:39:05.692 --> 00:39:07.094
My name is Mark Jeremias

747
00:39:07.194 --> 00:39:12.299
and I was executive VP
over merchandising for Ty Inc.


748
00:39:15.102 --> 00:39:17.070
I started in
the fashion business.


749
00:39:17.137 --> 00:39:18.214
I spent my life
watching supermodels


750
00:39:18.238 --> 00:39:20.407
take their clothes
off in front of me


751
00:39:20.474 --> 00:39:23.110
and then I came back and worked
with little teddy bears,


752
00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:25.379
so that's a rather big
difference.


753
00:39:27.714 --> 00:39:33.420
When your secondary market
becomes so, so, so much greater


754
00:39:33.487 --> 00:39:34.955
than your primary market,

755
00:39:35.055 --> 00:39:37.658
that's when a brand
has problems.


756
00:39:40.327 --> 00:39:42.095
- Yes.

757
00:39:42.796 --> 00:39:47.401
He's protecting the brand,
the trademark, the copyrights.


758
00:39:47.467 --> 00:39:52.406
You know, on the other hand,
I think that some aspects of it,


759
00:39:52.472 --> 00:39:56.476
um, it's just become
a part of his nature.


760
00:40:02.482 --> 00:40:03.850
Well, what kind of people?

761
00:40:03.951 --> 00:40:06.420
I'm just asking what kind of
people you talking about?


762
00:40:11.658 --> 00:40:13.694
That's all true.

763
00:40:13.794 --> 00:40:18.198
We had to tiptoe
around the Ty company itself.


764
00:40:18.298 --> 00:40:22.703
Because we were treated much
of the time as an enemy,


765
00:40:22.803 --> 00:40:24.805
which is really crazy

766
00:40:24.871 --> 00:40:28.542
because, um, we were
their mouthpiece


767
00:40:28.642 --> 00:40:33.113
and due to our media presence
and our magazines,


768
00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.950
that they sold, you know,
millions more Beanie Babies


769
00:40:37.017 --> 00:40:39.152
than they may be would have.

770
00:40:39.219 --> 00:40:41.188
Everybody is selling something.

771
00:40:41.288 --> 00:40:43.223
Beanie hats, Beanie shirts,

772
00:40:43.323 --> 00:40:47.060
Beanie jewellery, even
Beanie computer software.


773
00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.196
The one thing all these
people have in common


774
00:40:49.296 --> 00:40:52.399
is that none of them have
anything to do with Ty Inc.


775
00:40:52.499 --> 00:40:55.068
Probably the biggest
entrepreneur of all


776
00:40:55.168 --> 00:40:58.305
is Mary Beth Sobolewski.

777
00:40:58.372 --> 00:41:00.540
Originally,
Mary Beth was a collector,


778
00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:06.646
as her collecting increased,
she decided to do the magazine.


779
00:41:06.713 --> 00:41:08.315
The magazine
at the time I believe


780
00:41:08.382 --> 00:41:12.219
was starting to make
a lot of money.


781
00:41:12.319 --> 00:41:14.521
'Mary Beth's
Beanie World Monthly'


782
00:41:14.588 --> 00:41:16.256
was out for about 1.5 years

783
00:41:16.356 --> 00:41:18.892
and things were
going so smoothly


784
00:41:18.992 --> 00:41:22.596
and then all of a sudden, one
day, I'm working from my home


785
00:41:22.696 --> 00:41:24.765
and the doorbell rings.

786
00:41:24.865 --> 00:41:28.435
And I open the door and they
said, "Mary Beth Sobolewski?"


787
00:41:28.535 --> 00:41:32.873
Really nice, cheery young guy.
I said, "Yes, that's me."


788
00:41:32.939 --> 00:41:35.709
And he says, "Here,"
and I'm like, "What are these?"


789
00:41:35.776 --> 00:41:37.711
"You're being served."

790
00:41:37.778 --> 00:41:39.679
"Served? Oh, my gosh."

791
00:41:39.746 --> 00:41:41.948
You know, Mary Beth
was profiting


792
00:41:42.049 --> 00:41:44.951
off of our likeness and image.

793
00:41:45.052 --> 00:41:49.589
Well, that was an issue for us.

794
00:41:49.689 --> 00:41:52.459
So I was being sued by Ty Inc

795
00:41:52.559 --> 00:41:59.733
for infringement on using
the word 'Beanie' in our title.


796
00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.202
I had spent my last 1.5 years

797
00:42:02.269 --> 00:42:06.640
being a cheerleader
for this man and his products.


798
00:42:08.275 --> 00:42:10.911
And to get served,

799
00:42:10.977 --> 00:42:15.482
I felt like it was kind of a
thorn in my side.


800
00:42:15.582 --> 00:42:17.984
She took advantage of the
situation,


801
00:42:18.085 --> 00:42:22.489
of benefiting by infringing on
copyright and trademark,


802
00:42:22.589 --> 00:42:26.326
to me, it's not an ethical...
thing to do.


803
00:42:33.233 --> 00:42:34.835
What do you think my chances are

804
00:42:34.935 --> 00:42:37.015
of getting an interview
with Ty for this documentary?


805
00:42:37.104 --> 00:42:41.174
- Absolutely zero.
- Why?


806
00:42:41.274 --> 00:42:45.679
He doesn't like to interview.

807
00:42:45.779 --> 00:42:47.848
Stores say when they get them,

808
00:42:47.948 --> 00:42:49.483
they're as good as sold.

809
00:42:49.583 --> 00:42:53.453
It's a nationwide frenzy and
a multimillion-dollar business.


810
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:57.090
It was insane.

811
00:42:57.157 --> 00:43:00.193
We couldn't get the product
in fast enough to ship it out.


812
00:43:00.293 --> 00:43:02.195
I think at one point
in the late '90s,


813
00:43:02.295 --> 00:43:04.297
they were shipping
$1 million a day.


814
00:43:04.364 --> 00:43:06.500
It was crazy.

815
00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:11.872
My sales in 1996... Um...
I don't care, I'll tell you.


816
00:43:11.972 --> 00:43:13.707
They were $2.6 million.

817
00:43:13.807 --> 00:43:16.510
And in 1997 they
were $23 million.


818
00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:20.213
So yeah, it was
pretty straight up.


819
00:43:20.313 --> 00:43:24.451
I don't know how
many are sold but...


820
00:43:29.689 --> 00:43:33.326
Yep. Yep, I did.
I bought a crazy car.


821
00:43:34.227 --> 00:43:36.796
It was a Porsche 911.

822
00:43:36.863 --> 00:43:38.565
Pretty sweet car.
I was pretty lucky.


823
00:43:38.665 --> 00:43:39.900
So as it goes out the door,

824
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.235
there's another container
coming in the door.


825
00:43:42.335 --> 00:43:43.570
So...

826
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:45.314
All gone in two months.
That's the turnover.


827
00:43:45.338 --> 00:43:47.040
And then it will
all fill up again.


828
00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:50.810
My estimates are that we sold
over 40 million Beanie Babies.


829
00:43:51.511 --> 00:43:52.913
It's ridiculous.

830
00:43:53.013 --> 00:43:57.851
But think of how many he did,
if he did maybe 10 times that.


831
00:43:57.918 --> 00:43:59.853
You know, you can do the math.

832
00:44:02.022 --> 00:44:04.691
The world has lost
Princess Diana at age 36


833
00:44:04.758 --> 00:44:05.859
in a car crash in Paris,

834
00:44:05.926 --> 00:44:09.529
along with her companion...

835
00:44:09.596 --> 00:44:15.035
She was an iconic figure
in the world, I think.


836
00:44:15.101 --> 00:44:16.703
And it was covered endlessly.

837
00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:20.440
No-one could've
required this ocean of flowers.


838
00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:23.043
I think people were very,
very sad about


839
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:27.614
the loss of such a positive
person at such a young age.


840
00:44:27.714 --> 00:44:31.418
People can understand now
what Diana did for them.


841
00:44:41.461 --> 00:44:43.597
For those who love and collect
Beanie Babies,


842
00:44:43.697 --> 00:44:45.899
there's a new one hitting the
stores today,


843
00:44:45.966 --> 00:44:47.300
it's a bear called Princess

844
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.135
in honour of Diana,
the Princess of Wales.


845
00:44:49.236 --> 00:44:52.305
NBC's David Gregory this morning

846
00:44:52.405 --> 00:44:53.206
is in a shop in Chicago.

847
00:44:53.273 --> 00:44:55.308
- Hi, David.
- Hi, Katie.


848
00:44:55.408 --> 00:44:56.910
I wish you knew
how nervous I was


849
00:44:56.977 --> 00:44:58.378
on the train coming down here

850
00:44:58.445 --> 00:45:00.814
with this little
purple bear in my pocket.


851
00:45:00.914 --> 00:45:02.749
Do you know that if people
knew I had this,


852
00:45:02.816 --> 00:45:04.951
I could be mugged on
the streets of Chicago?


853
00:45:05.051 --> 00:45:06.953
Here it is.
This is the Princess bear.


854
00:45:07.053 --> 00:45:08.564
It's got the little yellow rose
on the chest there


855
00:45:08.588 --> 00:45:11.958
and a little inscription
from the Ty toy company


856
00:45:12.058 --> 00:45:14.127
saying "Like an angel,
she came from heaven above",


857
00:45:14.227 --> 00:45:16.596
"she shared her compassion
her pain, and her love."


858
00:45:16.663 --> 00:45:17.663
It goes on and on.

859
00:45:17.731 --> 00:45:19.899
All profits of Ty from
this collectible


860
00:45:19.966 --> 00:45:23.837
will be donated to the Diana,
Princess of Wales Memorial fund.


861
00:45:23.937 --> 00:45:28.508
Princess bear was hard to get,
so that's why they were popular.


862
00:45:28.608 --> 00:45:30.176
Each store will receive 12

863
00:45:30.277 --> 00:45:32.078
of these special Beanie Babies.

864
00:45:32.145 --> 00:45:36.416
And that will only add
to the collectability.


865
00:45:42.022 --> 00:45:44.090
That's what credit cards
are made for.


866
00:45:45.325 --> 00:45:47.594
Mm-hm. Credit card debt.

867
00:45:47.661 --> 00:45:50.697
There was thousands of dollars
people were spending.


868
00:45:50.797 --> 00:45:52.932
I will just give my credit card
number, just say,


869
00:45:52.999 --> 00:45:55.535
"Here, just send me every one
of those little Beanie Babies"


870
00:45:55.635 --> 00:45:58.872
"with the red Ty heart
and just send it to me."


871
00:46:00.974 --> 00:46:03.810
It became an addiction.

872
00:46:03.877 --> 00:46:06.713
I got addicted.

873
00:46:06.813 --> 00:46:08.315
I never was addicted to
anything.


874
00:46:08.381 --> 00:46:10.884
And I got addicted
to Beanie Babies.


875
00:46:10.984 --> 00:46:15.322
And I ran amok,
is what happened.


876
00:46:17.657 --> 00:46:18.858
That's a hard line to say.

877
00:46:18.958 --> 00:46:21.961
I mean, when does
it turn into addiction?


878
00:46:22.028 --> 00:46:23.897
When it becomes excessive?

879
00:46:23.997 --> 00:46:27.067
Where it affects your
normal life? Could be.


880
00:46:27.167 --> 00:46:28.811
What if your normal life
becomes part of the addiction,


881
00:46:28.835 --> 00:46:32.005
you know what I mean?
It's supporting the addiction?


882
00:46:32.072 --> 00:46:34.407
You just get the store, does
that become your normal life?


883
00:46:34.507 --> 00:46:37.143
Or is that part of
the addict's life?


884
00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:38.745
So...

885
00:46:38.845 --> 00:46:43.817
I could've been a Beanie Baby
addict at one point.


886
00:46:43.883 --> 00:46:48.755
The addiction is there.
And it's catching.


887
00:46:48.855 --> 00:46:50.557
I don't know why you
can't cure it.


888
00:46:50.657 --> 00:46:53.326
I'd have 36 teddy bears
sitting here,


889
00:46:53.393 --> 00:46:55.662
the brown teddy,
and I go to turn


890
00:46:55.729 --> 00:46:57.263
and then I'd see
one sitting there


891
00:46:57.364 --> 00:46:58.444
looking at me on the shelf.

892
00:46:58.531 --> 00:47:01.434
"Oh, look, he's cute.
I'll buy him."


893
00:47:02.936 --> 00:47:05.071
There's always a little bit of
financial problems


894
00:47:05.171 --> 00:47:07.841
and it's still haunting me to
this date


895
00:47:07.907 --> 00:47:11.444
so I get by but it's
hard, yeah, it's been hard.


896
00:47:11.544 --> 00:47:15.281
We should start a group
called BA instead of AA,


897
00:47:15.382 --> 00:47:16.616
Beanies Anonymous.

898
00:47:16.716 --> 00:47:18.051
We could stand up and say,

899
00:47:18.118 --> 00:47:21.121
"Hi, my name is Johnny,
and I have to have Gigi."


900
00:47:21.221 --> 00:47:24.391
- It's is it a 12-step?
- No, it's a 32-step program.


901
00:47:24.457 --> 00:47:25.625
- 12 won't cover it.

902
00:47:25.725 --> 00:47:30.063
This thing is so big
that I can't even imagine.


903
00:47:36.302 --> 00:47:39.706
I met Ty through my hairdresser,

904
00:47:39.773 --> 00:47:41.441
who offered to
make an introduction


905
00:47:41.541 --> 00:47:43.743
and asked me to
bring in my resume


906
00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:47.614
and he faxed over my resume
to Ty to take a look at.


907
00:47:50.216 --> 00:47:53.787
Hundreds of companies
wanted to dance with us.


908
00:47:53.887 --> 00:47:56.089
Virtually every category
that you can imagine,


909
00:47:56.156 --> 00:47:59.225
from fragrance
to children's apparel


910
00:47:59.292 --> 00:48:01.294
to Beanie Baby backpacks.

911
00:48:02.762 --> 00:48:05.999
Steven Spielberg's office
called regularly.


912
00:48:06.099 --> 00:48:09.669
They wanted Beanie Babies
for their movies.


913
00:48:16.109 --> 00:48:17.310
Virtually none.

914
00:48:19.612 --> 00:48:21.848
Ty was a very smart man.

915
00:48:21.948 --> 00:48:27.353
He understands that the greater
you diffuse your product,


916
00:48:27.454 --> 00:48:29.456
the less you can control it.

917
00:48:30.957 --> 00:48:32.468
They chase me around all day,
looking around my cart.


918
00:48:32.492 --> 00:48:34.694
I'll come out the back
of the store


919
00:48:34.794 --> 00:48:35.971
and there'll be five people
waiting on me.


920
00:48:35.995 --> 00:48:39.098
And they'll just smile,
I know what they want.


921
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:44.971
People were following
UPS trucks all over the suburbs,


922
00:48:45.038 --> 00:48:47.474
from one Hallmark store
to another.


923
00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:49.776
It was obvious
where it was going


924
00:48:49.843 --> 00:48:55.014
and it was kind of obvious
how to throw fuel on it.


925
00:48:56.282 --> 00:48:57.693
- Dinosaur?
- Nope. Stomach. I'm starving.


926
00:48:57.717 --> 00:49:00.887
- Hey, let's get a Happy Meal.
- Cool.


927
00:49:00.987 --> 00:49:04.390
In the 1990s,
a Happy Meal was a staple


928
00:49:04.491 --> 00:49:05.492
in every mom's life.

929
00:49:05.558 --> 00:49:08.895
A Happy Meal
made your kid happy.


930
00:49:08.995 --> 00:49:11.397
The first license that was
secured was a license


931
00:49:11.498 --> 00:49:15.235
with McDonald's Corporation
for a line of Teenie Beanies.


932
00:49:15.335 --> 00:49:17.470
- First I got Pinky.
- Then I got Pinky!


933
00:49:17.537 --> 00:49:19.672
I got Pinky And Patti
in the same week!


934
00:49:19.739 --> 00:49:21.341
What, did Vanessa
catch something?


935
00:49:21.407 --> 00:49:22.976
Teenie Beanie Baby-it is.

936
00:49:23.042 --> 00:49:24.577
Now at McDonald's,

937
00:49:24.677 --> 00:49:26.722
your kids can get Teenie Beanie
Babies in a Happy Meal.


938
00:49:26.746 --> 00:49:29.883
Real Ty Beanie Babies
in a mini size.


939
00:49:29.983 --> 00:49:32.051
Teeny Beanies.

940
00:49:33.486 --> 00:49:35.588
The Beanie Babies
officially went out


941
00:49:35.688 --> 00:49:37.166
with Happy Meals
at 10:30 this morning


942
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:39.926
and that's when
the onslaught began.


943
00:49:40.026 --> 00:49:41.861
Can I get the purple
Beanie Baby?


944
00:49:41.928 --> 00:49:44.030
She's already got the pink one.

945
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:52.005
McDonald's is selling
out in Chicago


946
00:49:52.071 --> 00:49:53.540
and throughout the Midwest.

947
00:49:53.606 --> 00:49:56.743
Parts of New York City
and Connecticut and the South.


948
00:49:56.843 --> 00:49:59.879
Maybe if there was a few people
left that hadn't heard


949
00:49:59.946 --> 00:50:01.614
of Beanie Babies or Ty Inc.,

950
00:50:01.714 --> 00:50:03.783
this was the way to make sure
everybody knew.


951
00:50:03.883 --> 00:50:05.051
McDonald's thought the Babies

952
00:50:05.118 --> 00:50:09.289
would last five weeks -
they were gone in two.


953
00:50:09.389 --> 00:50:11.591
If you want one of these little
cuddly characters,


954
00:50:11.691 --> 00:50:12.701
you better
get to McDonald's fast.


955
00:50:12.725 --> 00:50:16.863
The kids say they have
to have them all.


956
00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:19.132
The little Teenie Beanie Babies,

957
00:50:19.232 --> 00:50:23.436
that became a whole
collecting frenzy too.


958
00:50:23.536 --> 00:50:25.972
I got the cat. Two to go.

959
00:50:26.072 --> 00:50:29.709
The woman in front of
me, they had turned over a card


960
00:50:29.776 --> 00:50:31.277
that they were out of something

961
00:50:31.377 --> 00:50:34.113
and she must've been waiting
for it and she went nuts.


962
00:50:34.213 --> 00:50:37.050
Mom, I want this.

963
00:50:37.116 --> 00:50:39.452
I hate to admit
some of this stuff


964
00:50:39.552 --> 00:50:43.323
but I got a number of sets,
full sets of Teenie Beanies


965
00:50:43.423 --> 00:50:47.927
by no other way but going
through the drive-through.


966
00:50:47.994 --> 00:50:50.763
We would take all of the kids.

967
00:50:51.764 --> 00:50:52.908
And we would put them in line,

968
00:50:52.932 --> 00:50:54.767
"Here's $20.
Here's $20. Here's $20."


969
00:50:54.834 --> 00:50:57.270
Get in line, get a set
of the Teenie Beanies


970
00:50:57.337 --> 00:50:58.605
and out they would go.

971
00:50:58.671 --> 00:51:00.940
And we would go
to a different store,


972
00:51:01.007 --> 00:51:02.675
and we put them in line again.

973
00:51:02.775 --> 00:51:04.695
McDonald's says it
has ordered more Beanie Babies


974
00:51:04.744 --> 00:51:08.748
than it did
for its last largest promotion.


975
00:51:08.815 --> 00:51:10.950
Sets of the 12 new Beanies

976
00:51:11.017 --> 00:51:13.019
are already being
auctioned on eBay


977
00:51:13.119 --> 00:51:15.088
for twice the retail price.

978
00:51:15.154 --> 00:51:17.924
I figured $125
would be reasonable


979
00:51:17.991 --> 00:51:20.093
for a set of 10 Teenie Beanies

980
00:51:20.159 --> 00:51:23.463
and I sold 28 sets
the first weekend.


981
00:51:25.131 --> 00:51:26.366
The happiest meal of all

982
00:51:26.466 --> 00:51:28.668
is the profits
the company is reeling in.


983
00:51:28.768 --> 00:51:30.103
McDonald's expects

984
00:51:30.169 --> 00:51:33.373
to double its usual
sales of Happy Meals.


985
00:51:33.473 --> 00:51:34.941
Beanie Baby this, 
Beanie Baby...

986
00:51:35.008 --> 00:51:36.976
And they're not
only ordering two or three,


987
00:51:37.043 --> 00:51:39.112
they're ordering
like 10, 15, 20.


988
00:51:40.813 --> 00:51:42.215
This is our fourth McDonald's.

989
00:51:42.315 --> 00:51:45.284
I was only buying food in
order to get Beanie Babies.


990
00:51:45.351 --> 00:51:47.520
She doesn't want to eat all
these Happy Meals.


991
00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:49.222
Who could? Who would?

992
00:51:49.322 --> 00:51:51.991
It was, like, ridiculous.
People were throwing away food.


993
00:51:52.058 --> 00:51:54.394
That part I didn't like.

994
00:51:57.130 --> 00:52:01.200
Oh, my God. A guy's
stopping. This is unbelievable.


995
00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:04.404
Several hundred
little international bears


996
00:52:04.504 --> 00:52:05.838
headed to McDonald's

997
00:52:05.905 --> 00:52:08.975
dumped accidentally
in the middle of five lanes


998
00:52:09.042 --> 00:52:10.176
of 285 rush-hour traffic.

999
00:52:10.243 --> 00:52:13.880
The Golden Arches' loss
was someone's gain.


1000
00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:15.415
And it wasn't pretty.

1001
00:52:15.515 --> 00:52:20.019
There it is! There it is!
Oh, my God. Look at this.


1002
00:52:20.086 --> 00:52:21.487
They're rolling on this, right?

1003
00:52:21.554 --> 00:52:23.556
Would you ask your mom
to pull over?


1004
00:52:23.656 --> 00:52:27.260
- Yeah.
- You think she would?


1005
00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:30.897
They're crazy. Come on, folks.
It's just Beanie Babies.


1006
00:52:32.065 --> 00:52:35.735
Greed. It is the dark side
of anything.


1007
00:52:35.835 --> 00:52:38.171
One store in Royal Oak, Michigan

1008
00:52:38.237 --> 00:52:39.539
ran out in just two hours,

1009
00:52:39.605 --> 00:52:42.442
a shipment in Wisconsin
was hijacked by thieves.


1010
00:52:42.542 --> 00:52:44.444
Beanie Babies
are becoming so valuable,


1011
00:52:44.544 --> 00:52:47.113
they're attracting
the criminal element now.


1012
00:52:47.213 --> 00:52:48.715
Beanie burglars, if you will.

1013
00:52:48.781 --> 00:52:51.084
That's who investigators say
broke into a home


1014
00:52:51.184 --> 00:52:56.189
here in Pasco County and stole
a family's entire collection.


1015
00:52:56.255 --> 00:52:59.358
Its felony theft, $300,000
worth of Beanie Babies


1016
00:52:59.425 --> 00:53:00.860
were taken.

1017
00:53:01.861 --> 00:53:03.129
At tradeshows, people knew

1018
00:53:03.229 --> 00:53:06.132
that I would have these rare
Beanie Babies.


1019
00:53:06.232 --> 00:53:11.204
They would tried stealing them,
right out of the little cage.


1020
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:13.306
And then I thought, "Oh, my God",

1021
00:53:13.406 --> 00:53:15.908
"I've gotta hire
off-duty policemen"


1022
00:53:15.975 --> 00:53:18.544
"to stand by my table."

1023
00:53:18.611 --> 00:53:20.146
We had a full transport truck

1024
00:53:20.246 --> 00:53:22.982
and the next morning, we had
the shipping company call us


1025
00:53:23.082 --> 00:53:25.485
and say, "We went to pick
up the truck last night",


1026
00:53:25.585 --> 00:53:26.786
"but it wasn't there."

1027
00:53:26.886 --> 00:53:30.656
And I said,
"I don't know where it is."


1028
00:53:30.757 --> 00:53:32.735
The police department views
this matter very seriously.


1029
00:53:32.759 --> 00:53:35.161
Just as seriously as we would

1030
00:53:35.261 --> 00:53:38.498
if it involved the disappearance
of money, drugs or weapons.


1031
00:53:38.598 --> 00:53:39.608
Well, they found the truck the
next day,


1032
00:53:39.632 --> 00:53:41.000
but it was completely empty

1033
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:44.070
and it had about $500,000 worth
of product on it.


1034
00:53:44.137 --> 00:53:46.939
That was the point probably
in time where I went,


1035
00:53:47.006 --> 00:53:49.509
"Well, this is really,
really out of control."


1036
00:53:49.609 --> 00:53:52.345
I mean, there were so many
scams going on


1037
00:53:52.445 --> 00:53:54.914
it was unbelievable.

1038
00:53:54.981 --> 00:53:56.115
We had employees who were

1039
00:53:56.182 --> 00:54:00.253
getting bribed
to put orders through.


1040
00:54:00.319 --> 00:54:03.489
We even had employees walking
out of the warehouse


1041
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:04.924
with them in their shoes.

1042
00:54:04.991 --> 00:54:07.426
They are putting them
in their pants,


1043
00:54:07.493 --> 00:54:08.771
they were putting them
in their shirts.


1044
00:54:08.795 --> 00:54:11.664
One woman, who was very sweet,

1045
00:54:11.764 --> 00:54:15.201
she was an A-cup,
and she leaves in a double-D.


1046
00:54:15.301 --> 00:54:18.137
It was bad.
You know, it was bad.


1047
00:54:18.204 --> 00:54:20.306
A security guard
making the rounds


1048
00:54:20.373 --> 00:54:22.975
was surprised by two men
who jumped him from behind,


1049
00:54:23.042 --> 00:54:25.211
and attacked
with a sledgehammer.


1050
00:54:25.311 --> 00:54:27.713
This is pretty much
the worst I've seen


1051
00:54:27.814 --> 00:54:31.551
as far as for a stuffed animal
or a toy for a child.


1052
00:54:33.486 --> 00:54:36.022
Beanie Babies are
more than just a passion -


1053
00:54:36.122 --> 00:54:37.466
for Ty Warner,
these beanbag collectibles


1054
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:41.561
have turned the company into
a billion-dollar business.


1055
00:54:41.661 --> 00:54:44.197
Sales of Beanie Babies
skyrocketed


1056
00:54:44.297 --> 00:54:47.834
from a reported $215 million
worth last year


1057
00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:52.305
to an estimated
$2.5 billion this year.


1058
00:54:53.873 --> 00:54:56.342
There was a sales meeting
we had where he had announced,


1059
00:54:56.409 --> 00:54:58.911
"I have never been in a room
with so many millionaires,"


1060
00:54:59.011 --> 00:55:00.413
or something to that effect.

1061
00:55:00.513 --> 00:55:02.515
And we had our whole
management team there.


1062
00:55:02.582 --> 00:55:06.018
None of the management team
was compensated like that.


1063
00:55:06.085 --> 00:55:07.386
The reps were obviously...

1064
00:55:07.486 --> 00:55:09.922
They get a percentage
of the commissions


1065
00:55:10.022 --> 00:55:13.759
and they were
making very, very big money.


1066
00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:15.828
And it was one of those things,

1067
00:55:15.895 --> 00:55:18.231
all the management team
sort of, like...


1068
00:55:18.331 --> 00:55:21.167
bit their tongue and that's
where it sort of hits you.


1069
00:55:23.102 --> 00:55:26.072
The first year
he became successful,


1070
00:55:26.172 --> 00:55:33.279
he gave all his employees
their annual salary as a bonus.


1071
00:55:33.379 --> 00:55:35.181
And then the following year,

1072
00:55:35.248 --> 00:55:37.617
he gave them all
a Billionaire Bear,


1073
00:55:37.717 --> 00:55:45.391
that cost him maybe $0.35 to
make, and that was their bonus.


1074
00:55:45.458 --> 00:55:46.926
Billionaire Bears,

1075
00:55:47.026 --> 00:55:48.461
here's a picture of one of them,

1076
00:55:48.561 --> 00:55:51.430
it's given by Ty,
there's 475 of these made,


1077
00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:55.635
signed, and numbered,
to his employees.


1078
00:55:55.735 --> 00:55:57.970
The warehouse employees were
mostly immigrants,


1079
00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:01.974
a lot of them
didn't speak English.


1080
00:56:05.311 --> 00:56:07.980
A lot of the employees
wanted the money.


1081
00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:10.449
Because if the bear sold
for $6,000,


1082
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:14.320
that's a lot of money,
they could go and buy furniture


1083
00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:18.457
or appliances or put
a down-payment on a car.


1084
00:56:18.557 --> 00:56:20.493
He would number each Beanie Baby

1085
00:56:20.593 --> 00:56:22.828
so they could tell
which employee


1086
00:56:22.929 --> 00:56:24.009
had which Billionaire Bear.

1087
00:56:24.096 --> 00:56:27.266
So they would come to me
to sell them


1088
00:56:27.333 --> 00:56:29.402
and I would put a range of
numbers on eBay,


1089
00:56:29.468 --> 00:56:31.103
so that they wouldn't know,

1090
00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:34.674
Ty wouldn't know who sold
their bear on eBay.


1091
00:56:40.446 --> 00:56:41.580
He had a number of people

1092
00:56:41.647 --> 00:56:45.851
that would check
on everything on eBay


1093
00:56:45.952 --> 00:56:48.788
that people did.
That was their job,


1094
00:56:48.854 --> 00:56:52.692
to sit there and check auctions.

1095
00:56:52.792 --> 00:56:57.930
I know of several occasions
where they stopped my auctions.


1096
00:57:02.935 --> 00:57:05.171
They thought I was
and I never did.


1097
00:57:05.271 --> 00:57:07.039
But they thought about
that with everyone.


1098
00:57:07.139 --> 00:57:10.543
They thought everybody
was corrupt except them.


1099
00:57:10.643 --> 00:57:13.879
And it turned out that they
were the corrupt ones.


1100
00:57:23.489 --> 00:57:25.825
As the company expanded and

1101
00:57:25.891 --> 00:57:28.694
there was additional management
being brought on,


1102
00:57:28.794 --> 00:57:30.730
not everyone had the same values

1103
00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:33.499
and that, for me, was probably
the most challenging,


1104
00:57:33.566 --> 00:57:35.067
dealing with some people.

1105
00:57:35.167 --> 00:57:37.346
I just didn't agree with that
and that's what I told them.


1106
00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:38.571
I said, "The management team"

1107
00:57:38.671 --> 00:57:42.708
"is different at this point
in time - I'm done."


1108
00:57:56.889 --> 00:57:59.759
At that point,
the impact of what we had done


1109
00:57:59.859 --> 00:58:01.093
was indisputable.

1110
00:58:01.193 --> 00:58:07.033
And what I wanted ultimately,
I wasn't able to get.


1111
00:58:07.099 --> 00:58:08.734
So we left.

1112
00:58:08.834 --> 00:58:10.436
And I later found out

1113
00:58:10.536 --> 00:58:13.105
that people within
the Board of Directors


1114
00:58:13.205 --> 00:58:18.110
did not really
understand the Internet


1115
00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:21.414
and thought it was a fad.

1116
00:58:24.717 --> 00:58:26.085
I was very hurt.

1117
00:58:26.185 --> 00:58:28.397
Even though I walked away and
it was me that walked away,


1118
00:58:28.421 --> 00:58:30.222
it was such a big part of
my life.


1119
00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:33.025
Welcome to Ty Canada, guys.

1120
00:58:33.092 --> 00:58:33.959
- How you doing?
- Good.


1121
00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:36.529
Ty started to ask
for things that


1122
00:58:36.595 --> 00:58:38.431
were completely out of the norm

1123
00:58:38.531 --> 00:58:40.800
from the relationship we'd had.

1124
00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:43.903
He asked me for my entire
customer list.


1125
00:58:43.969 --> 00:58:46.272
These are all Beanie Babies,
these are all Beanie Babies,


1126
00:58:46.372 --> 00:58:48.240
and these are all Beanie Babies.

1127
00:58:48.307 --> 00:58:52.211
He asked for me to put my
building up as collateral


1128
00:58:52.278 --> 00:58:54.113
and I said,
"I can't do those things."


1129
00:58:54.213 --> 00:58:56.415
"I'm not going
to do those things."


1130
00:58:56.482 --> 00:58:59.251
And he said
"Well, I guess we're done."


1131
00:58:59.318 --> 00:59:01.454
And it was like that.

1132
00:59:03.255 --> 00:59:04.590
We ended up having to close

1133
00:59:04.657 --> 00:59:05.934
and I had to let
all of our staff go.


1134
00:59:05.958 --> 00:59:07.226
And having the bank come in

1135
00:59:07.293 --> 00:59:11.897
and sell off all of
the product that we had.


1136
00:59:11.964 --> 00:59:15.434
And yeah, that was probably the
closest I've ever come


1137
00:59:15.501 --> 00:59:17.269
to a nervous breakdown.

1138
00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:24.076
Everybody keeps going,
"How long can it last?"


1139
00:59:24.143 --> 00:59:25.478
And it's like, "Forever."

1140
00:59:25.578 --> 00:59:28.514
I don't see any end in sight
to Beanie Babies at all.


1141
00:59:28.614 --> 00:59:30.449
You know, people get
caught up in these crazes


1142
00:59:30.516 --> 00:59:32.852
and they think they're
going to go on forever.


1143
00:59:32.952 --> 00:59:34.186
This is here to stay.

1144
00:59:34.286 --> 00:59:35.597
I don't think the Beanie craze
will ever die.


1145
00:59:35.621 --> 00:59:39.525
People think prices will
continually rise to infinity.


1146
00:59:39.625 --> 00:59:40.993
This morning we asked two people

1147
00:59:41.093 --> 00:59:42.828
with two very differing
opinions.


1148
00:59:42.928 --> 00:59:45.965
Mary Beth Sobolewski, also with
us this morning Harry Rinker.


1149
00:59:46.031 --> 00:59:49.368
I really was a handsome dude
when I was younger, wasn't I?


1150
00:59:49.468 --> 00:59:53.372
Mr Rinker, you call yourself -
your term - a beanie meanie.


1151
00:59:53.472 --> 00:59:54.874
Why?

1152
00:59:54.974 --> 00:59:56.518
Well, first of all,
yes, there's a secondary market,


1153
00:59:56.542 --> 00:59:57.810
but what you have to understand

1154
00:59:57.877 --> 00:59:59.087
about the Beanie Baby
secondary market


1155
00:59:59.111 --> 01:00:01.046
is it is highly speculative.

1156
01:00:01.147 --> 01:00:02.481
We have no guarantees

1157
01:00:02.548 --> 01:00:04.817
that the prices today will
be the prices tomorrow


1158
01:00:04.884 --> 01:00:07.386
and what goes up
is definitely gonna come down.


1159
01:00:07.486 --> 01:00:09.522
I was the Beanie Meanie.

1160
01:00:09.622 --> 01:00:11.123
I would debate with these people

1161
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:12.458
because they really believed it.

1162
01:00:12.525 --> 01:00:15.227
Mary Beth, I know you want to
disagree with that.


1163
01:00:15.327 --> 01:00:17.229
You say that every time
a new one comes out,


1164
01:00:17.329 --> 01:00:18.631
an old one goes off the market,

1165
01:00:18.697 --> 01:00:20.966
they get bigger and better,
is that the case?


1166
01:00:21.033 --> 01:00:21.901
Absolutely.

1167
01:00:22.001 --> 01:00:23.235
I have to agree with Harry

1168
01:00:23.335 --> 01:00:25.004
that it is a very
speculative market.


1169
01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:26.372
There's no doubt about it.

1170
01:00:26.472 --> 01:00:29.642
But any long-term investment
is speculative.


1171
01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:31.210
The problem is

1172
01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:32.988
that when somebody
is trying to tout a market,


1173
01:00:33.012 --> 01:00:34.480
they tout the top end,

1174
01:00:34.547 --> 01:00:37.249
and don't ever ask, "What's
the condition of the market"


1175
01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:38.918
"in the middle and low end?"

1176
01:00:39.018 --> 01:00:42.488
And if the bottom and the middle
of the market was weak,


1177
01:00:42.555 --> 01:00:44.757
that was a bad market
to be playing in.


1178
01:00:44.857 --> 01:00:48.994
Six years after
Ty introduced Beanie Babies


1179
01:00:49.061 --> 01:00:50.996
and 253 versions later,

1180
01:00:51.063 --> 01:00:52.364
these small stuffed animals

1181
01:00:52.431 --> 01:00:54.733
are sagging on
the secondary market.


1182
01:00:54.833 --> 01:00:58.871
Three different guides show the
values of many retired beanies.


1183
01:00:58.938 --> 01:01:01.874
Those no longer made,
have dropped considerably.


1184
01:01:01.941 --> 01:01:05.177
What do you hope to do
with 400 Beanie Babies someday?


1185
01:01:05.244 --> 01:01:08.080
Give them to my kids
when they get old enough


1186
01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:09.448
to maybe one day,

1187
01:01:09.548 --> 01:01:11.428
it might send them through
college or something.


1188
01:01:11.517 --> 01:01:14.286
At some point, there
comes a time


1189
01:01:14.386 --> 01:01:16.555
where somebody buys it
for a certain amount


1190
01:01:16.622 --> 01:01:18.624
and they can't
sell it for profit.


1191
01:01:18.724 --> 01:01:20.125
People say, "You know what?"

1192
01:01:20.226 --> 01:01:22.027
"I don't want to buy
beanies anymore"


1193
01:01:22.094 --> 01:01:23.529
"because I can't make a profit."

1194
01:01:23.596 --> 01:01:27.399
So then there's more supply
than there is demand.


1195
01:01:27.466 --> 01:01:32.137
And now the same dynamics
that fuelled the bubble,


1196
01:01:32.238 --> 01:01:33.405
they're in reverse,

1197
01:01:33.472 --> 01:01:36.141
and it can be a vicious cycle
to the downside.


1198
01:01:37.943 --> 01:01:39.311
Welcome back.

1199
01:01:39.411 --> 01:01:41.523
On special assignment tonight,
a close look at Beanie Babies.


1200
01:01:41.547 --> 01:01:45.084
Six years ago, these
tiny toys hit the stores


1201
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:46.552
and sales now are sagging,

1202
01:01:46.619 --> 01:01:51.156
values are plunging,
and collectors are concerned.


1203
01:01:51.257 --> 01:01:54.260
All of a sudden,
there was this one month


1204
01:01:54.326 --> 01:01:57.429
when a couple started
to go down.


1205
01:01:59.298 --> 01:02:01.667
And then you notice
the next month,


1206
01:02:01.767 --> 01:02:02.911
more and more and more
went down.


1207
01:02:02.935 --> 01:02:06.505
And that was getting
a little frightening.


1208
01:02:06.605 --> 01:02:07.882
Don't you think a lot
of people out there


1209
01:02:07.906 --> 01:02:09.618
have been misled by
the worth of Beanie Babies?


1210
01:02:09.642 --> 01:02:13.846
The ones that have
been retired since 1998


1211
01:02:13.946 --> 01:02:16.949
have, in my opinion,
been overproduced.


1212
01:02:17.016 --> 01:02:18.517
Like the Princess Di bear,

1213
01:02:18.617 --> 01:02:22.855
people paid hundreds for her,
we were offered eight bucks.


1214
01:02:22.955 --> 01:02:25.457
It was no longer
the market of scarcity


1215
01:02:25.524 --> 01:02:28.327
and collecting
like a collector would,


1216
01:02:28.427 --> 01:02:29.595
it was flooded.

1217
01:02:29.662 --> 01:02:31.273
I think a lot of people got
caught up in it


1218
01:02:31.297 --> 01:02:33.198
without understanding
how it worked.


1219
01:02:33.299 --> 01:02:35.501
The secondary market couldn't

1220
01:02:35.601 --> 01:02:38.270
sustain an increase
in value and all of a sudden,


1221
01:02:38.337 --> 01:02:39.204
the Beanie Babies
that you thought


1222
01:02:39.305 --> 01:02:41.373
you could double your money on

1223
01:02:41.473 --> 01:02:43.842
were selling for less
than you paid for them.


1224
01:02:48.047 --> 01:02:51.850
Just when I felt that people
were getting tired of something,


1225
01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:56.488
Ty would always do something
to create a frenzy.


1226
01:02:56.555 --> 01:02:58.223
When Beanie Baby collectors

1227
01:02:58.324 --> 01:02:59.992
logged on to their
favorite website,


1228
01:03:00.059 --> 01:03:00.993
this is what they found.

1229
01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:04.396
In the fall of 1999,

1230
01:03:04.496 --> 01:03:07.066
he came out with
the announcement


1231
01:03:07.166 --> 01:03:11.537
that there were
gonna be no more Beanie Babies.


1232
01:03:11.637 --> 01:03:13.472
A web posting by
the Ty Corporation


1233
01:03:13.539 --> 01:03:14.840
makes it very clear

1234
01:03:14.907 --> 01:03:17.509
that Beanie Babies will
be a thing of the past


1235
01:03:17.576 --> 01:03:18.911
come December 31.

1236
01:03:19.011 --> 01:03:21.747
Estimates are more than
a billion Beanies have sold,


1237
01:03:21.847 --> 01:03:25.751
and when inventory clears,
there will be no more.


1238
01:03:25.851 --> 01:03:27.251
That was the saddest day
of my life.


1239
01:03:27.319 --> 01:03:30.089
I thought, "Oh, my God,
this is..."


1240
01:03:30.189 --> 01:03:33.158
"You can't take these little
Beanie Babies away."


1241
01:03:34.393 --> 01:03:35.894
December 31, the entire line

1242
01:03:35.994 --> 01:03:37.496
of Beanie Babies
will be retired.


1243
01:03:37.563 --> 01:03:42.101
No more Beanie Babies
created. No more.


1244
01:03:42.201 --> 01:03:44.203
I think it's very, very sad.

1245
01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:45.871
I think it's really bad.

1246
01:03:45.938 --> 01:03:47.239
Kinda sad.

1247
01:03:48.607 --> 01:03:51.210
I'm happy. I'm going to
get a lot of money now.


1248
01:03:51.276 --> 01:03:54.613
Everybody started emailing
and calling and acting crazy.


1249
01:03:54.713 --> 01:03:58.117
"Did you see this? Did you
see this on the news?"


1250
01:03:58.217 --> 01:04:00.052
"Did you see this all over the
Internet?"


1251
01:04:00.119 --> 01:04:02.755
Retailers say this latest bit
of Beanie buzz


1252
01:04:02.855 --> 01:04:04.723
is moving merchandise.

1253
01:04:04.790 --> 01:04:07.793
So yesterday, you sold 200
Beanie Babies in two hours.


1254
01:04:07.893 --> 01:04:09.461
At least. Yeah.

1255
01:04:09.561 --> 01:04:11.241
This is all that's
left at the Gift Cottage


1256
01:04:11.296 --> 01:04:12.931
in south suburban Midlothian.

1257
01:04:13.031 --> 01:04:14.900
The phones were nonstop ringing.

1258
01:04:14.967 --> 01:04:16.635
We had customers
every second of the day


1259
01:04:16.735 --> 01:04:19.438
trying to get any
Beanie Baby they could get.


1260
01:04:19.538 --> 01:04:22.574
He knew how to market
his beanies.


1261
01:04:22.641 --> 01:04:24.943
He knew how to get
interest from people.


1262
01:04:25.043 --> 01:04:26.979
He knew how to get those
emotions going


1263
01:04:27.079 --> 01:04:31.717
in order for us
to continue buying his beanies.


1264
01:04:31.784 --> 01:04:33.128
My prediction
is that there will be


1265
01:04:33.152 --> 01:04:36.388
some kind of Beanies, maybe
in a little different way,


1266
01:04:36.455 --> 01:04:37.589
for the new millennium,

1267
01:04:37.656 --> 01:04:39.458
maybe with a little
different look.


1268
01:04:39.558 --> 01:04:41.627
So guess what?

1269
01:04:41.727 --> 01:04:45.731
He comes up with this
'vote to save the Beanies'.


1270
01:04:45.798 --> 01:04:48.967
Starting December 31,
Beanie Baby fanatics


1271
01:04:49.067 --> 01:04:50.769
can vote on Ty's website.

1272
01:04:50.836 --> 01:04:52.956
They announced on the website
that people are going to


1273
01:04:53.005 --> 01:04:54.173
get to vote now for 50 cents.

1274
01:04:54.273 --> 01:04:55.340
So you can vote.

1275
01:04:55.441 --> 01:04:57.009
I think it's going
to be phenomenal


1276
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:59.189
and it's gonna be... you know,
this is PT Barnum time.


1277
01:04:59.244 --> 01:05:02.614
This is, you know, "There's
a sucker born every minute."


1278
01:05:05.818 --> 01:05:09.988
We're gonna see people
behaving in apocalyptic ways.


1279
01:05:10.088 --> 01:05:12.925
Will computers
recognize the year 2000


1280
01:05:12.991 --> 01:05:16.595
or will they shut down
thinking is the year 1900?


1281
01:05:16.662 --> 01:05:19.431
Some believe the feared Y2K bug

1282
01:05:19.498 --> 01:05:22.034
could temporarily knock out
power.


1283
01:05:22.134 --> 01:05:25.804
Shut down the water system
and cause panic in the streets.


1284
01:05:25.871 --> 01:05:29.274
The bottom line, no one can
really predict the future.


1285
01:05:29.341 --> 01:05:33.679
Five, four, three, two, one!

1286
01:05:42.387 --> 01:05:46.825
You've got mail.

1287
01:05:48.827 --> 01:05:51.129
This week, drumroll please,
it was announced


1288
01:05:51.196 --> 01:05:53.999
that the toys will continue
to hit the stores.


1289
01:05:59.304 --> 01:06:03.208
Now some are wondering if this
wasn't just one big PR stunt.


1290
01:06:03.308 --> 01:06:04.588
What a wonderful way to find out

1291
01:06:04.643 --> 01:06:06.745
if there's a collectible
audience out there,


1292
01:06:06.845 --> 01:06:07.980
let people vote!

1293
01:06:08.046 --> 01:06:10.048
- I'm gonna...
- What about that Internet vote?


1294
01:06:10.148 --> 01:06:12.251
- It was so staged, wasn't it?
- Do you think?


1295
01:06:12.351 --> 01:06:15.220
Collectors are taking
a wait-and-see attitude


1296
01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:16.655
towards the new toys.

1297
01:06:16.722 --> 01:06:22.895
Don't do it. Stay out of it.
It's worse than smoking.


1298
01:06:22.995 --> 01:06:26.932
We realized it was just
a gimmick to entice people


1299
01:06:27.032 --> 01:06:30.536
to possibly purchase
more of his Beanies.


1300
01:06:30.602 --> 01:06:32.838
I personally felt manipulated.

1301
01:06:32.905 --> 01:06:34.940
It's like, "Are you kidding?"

1302
01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.109
Why would you stop a good thing?

1303
01:06:37.209 --> 01:06:39.778
It was too popular, too...

1304
01:06:39.878 --> 01:06:41.780
I think it was just
a big publicity stunt.


1305
01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:44.449
I think he just wanted to
create more demand.


1306
01:06:44.550 --> 01:06:46.051
Beanie insiders say

1307
01:06:46.118 --> 01:06:49.254
they're are little sceptical
about the company's motives.


1308
01:06:49.354 --> 01:06:50.865
What might have
looked like a great idea


1309
01:06:50.889 --> 01:06:54.626
because he was used to
retiring and creating,


1310
01:06:54.726 --> 01:06:59.097
all of a sudden, um, backfired.

1311
01:06:59.197 --> 01:07:01.633
I think it's time
to stop, myself.


1312
01:07:03.368 --> 01:07:05.904
I think a lot of the collectors,

1313
01:07:05.971 --> 01:07:10.242
they just sold their Beanies
and got out of the collection.


1314
01:07:19.985 --> 01:07:22.487
The people were disgusted
with all the money they'd lost,


1315
01:07:22.588 --> 01:07:24.923
they were just letting
them go for practically nothing.


1316
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:28.660
A lot of people that
had significant collections


1317
01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.095
were willing to discount it

1318
01:07:30.162 --> 01:07:32.331
if you bought a lot
of them at once.


1319
01:07:32.431 --> 01:07:34.833
All of the original Beanie Baby
sites were shutting down


1320
01:07:34.933 --> 01:07:37.603
and he started collecting
Beanie Babies


1321
01:07:37.669 --> 01:07:39.304
at just the right moment.

1322
01:07:39.404 --> 01:07:44.009
We have about 22,000
Ty products.


1323
01:07:49.448 --> 01:07:51.683
Oh, boy. You hit me with
a question like that. Um...


1324
01:07:51.783 --> 01:07:54.686
I'd have to find
him but it's a lamb.


1325
01:07:56.955 --> 01:07:59.424
Yeah. There you go.
There's Sondra.


1326
01:08:01.627 --> 01:08:04.463
I'm gonna go with Ringo
the Raccoon


1327
01:08:04.529 --> 01:08:06.465
because there's something
about a raccoon's mask


1328
01:08:06.531 --> 01:08:08.934
that just reminds me of my dad

1329
01:08:09.001 --> 01:08:10.411
because I thought
it looked like him,


1330
01:08:10.435 --> 01:08:14.206
it reminded me of the little
dark circles under his eyes.


1331
01:08:14.306 --> 01:08:18.477
Anyway, it was
Ringo the Raccoon.


1332
01:08:19.177 --> 01:08:21.313
Wow.

1333
01:08:22.781 --> 01:08:25.183
It's not a commercial
collection,


1334
01:08:25.283 --> 01:08:30.055
it's a collection that we love
the items we're collecting.


1335
01:08:30.155 --> 01:08:32.557
Really have warm feelings
for a lot of them.


1336
01:08:32.658 --> 01:08:33.859
And when you have them around,

1337
01:08:33.959 --> 01:08:35.527
they kind of cheer you up,

1338
01:08:35.627 --> 01:08:37.162
and if you really get upset,

1339
01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:40.732
you can talk to them or yell
at them, they don't judge you.


1340
01:08:40.832 --> 01:08:43.135
He's never yelled
at any of them.


1341
01:08:43.201 --> 01:08:45.804
No. I don't want to hurt
their feelings.


1342
01:08:47.205 --> 01:08:48.640
I don't have any problem

1343
01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:49.975
with Beanie Baby collectors

1344
01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:52.511
if they collect it
because they love it.


1345
01:08:52.577 --> 01:08:54.079
I'm contemptuous of people

1346
01:08:54.179 --> 01:08:57.082
who think that antiques and
collectibles are investments.


1347
01:08:57.182 --> 01:08:58.817
It's a gamble!

1348
01:08:58.884 --> 01:09:00.185
The media likes to talk about

1349
01:09:00.252 --> 01:09:01.772
the rise and fall
of the Beanie Babies.


1350
01:09:01.853 --> 01:09:04.423
And we kind of want
to refer to that


1351
01:09:04.523 --> 01:09:07.926
as the rise and fall of
the Beanie Baby gamblers.


1352
01:09:20.038 --> 01:09:25.577
The days of that
magazine took time and energy.


1353
01:09:25.677 --> 01:09:29.748
It did cost me a lot.

1354
01:09:31.283 --> 01:09:38.090
I hope my kids,
when they look back on it now,


1355
01:09:38.190 --> 01:09:44.296
don't feel like I didn't give
them what they deserved.


1356
01:09:45.230 --> 01:09:47.866
So, um...

1357
01:09:49.468 --> 01:09:54.206
I hope I gave them what
they needed during that time.


1358
01:09:57.809 --> 01:10:01.580
I'm sure for some people,
they collect their whole life.


1359
01:10:01.646 --> 01:10:04.983
For me, it's now in the past.

1360
01:10:05.083 --> 01:10:10.489
Now the Beanie Babies are in
a case. And life has gone on.


1361
01:10:23.468 --> 01:10:25.837
No.

1362
01:10:25.937 --> 01:10:28.082
Like I said before, it's more
like Beanie Baby bankruptcy.


1363
01:10:28.106 --> 01:10:34.846
Because I had a lot
and I still have a lot.


1364
01:10:35.847 --> 01:10:37.449
It's been a long time,

1365
01:10:37.516 --> 01:10:40.752
we're talking
at least 25 years or so.


1366
01:10:40.819 --> 01:10:44.422
And I didn't sell
a lot of stuff.


1367
01:10:44.489 --> 01:10:46.191
I don't know
what would've happened


1368
01:10:46.291 --> 01:10:48.102
if I had sold them all
and made a lot of money then.


1369
01:10:48.126 --> 01:10:51.329
It would've made things
easier now, that's for sure.


1370
01:10:51.429 --> 01:10:53.999
Maybe I could've paid off the
house sooner, you know?


1371
01:10:54.099 --> 01:10:55.934
I don't know.

1372
01:10:58.136 --> 01:11:00.806
The only person that really
became a big millionaire


1373
01:11:00.872 --> 01:11:01.873
was Ty himself

1374
01:11:01.973 --> 01:11:05.043
because he ended up
getting so rich.


1375
01:11:05.143 --> 01:11:08.513
The billionaire
creator of Beanie Babies


1376
01:11:08.613 --> 01:11:12.217
has been accused of hiding
as much as $107 million


1377
01:11:12.317 --> 01:11:16.621
in a Swiss bank account
to avoid paying taxes on it.


1378
01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.228
H. Ty Warner,

1379
01:11:23.328 --> 01:11:25.664
the man behind the lovable plush
toys popular in the '90s,


1380
01:11:25.730 --> 01:11:29.401
reportedly faces a stint in
prison for up to 57 months


1381
01:11:29.501 --> 01:11:33.238
when he's sentenced
on January 14 in Chicago.


1382
01:11:36.007 --> 01:11:37.342
I didn't know much about it

1383
01:11:37.409 --> 01:11:38.769
other than what
I read in the paper


1384
01:11:38.844 --> 01:11:41.213
but I understand that he had
money in an offshore account


1385
01:11:41.313 --> 01:11:44.583
and was not paying taxes
on some of his profits.


1386
01:11:44.683 --> 01:11:46.751
He admitted that he
set up an offshore bank account


1387
01:11:46.852 --> 01:11:50.722
in Switzerland
back in the 1990s.


1388
01:11:50.822 --> 01:11:52.424
Warner said in court

1389
01:11:52.524 --> 01:11:54.593
his decision to evade taxes
was a bad one,


1390
01:11:54.693 --> 01:11:57.362
and he is begging a judge
not to put him behind bars


1391
01:11:57.429 --> 01:11:59.197
after admitting to tax evasion.

1392
01:11:59.264 --> 01:12:01.600
I remember seeing the
pictures of him in court


1393
01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:03.602
and thinking, "Wow,
that's really too bad."


1394
01:12:03.702 --> 01:12:05.370
"I liked that guy."

1395
01:12:05.437 --> 01:12:08.273
Warner pleaded guilty
to the accusation in court.


1396
01:12:08.373 --> 01:12:11.009
Now all that's left
is for a judge to decide


1397
01:12:11.076 --> 01:12:13.712
how Warner will
pay for his crimes.


1398
01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.980
The judge
says a two-year probation


1399
01:12:23.021 --> 01:12:25.457
and community service sentence
is fair


1400
01:12:25.557 --> 01:12:28.226
given Mr Warner's
personal humiliation


1401
01:12:28.293 --> 01:12:30.128
and record of charitable works.

1402
01:12:30.228 --> 01:12:31.563
The judge said

1403
01:12:31.630 --> 01:12:33.798
that charity work
that Warner had done,


1404
01:12:33.899 --> 01:12:37.402
that justified no prison time.

1405
01:12:39.404 --> 01:12:42.307
I don't like the idea of people
avoiding paying their taxes.


1406
01:12:42.407 --> 01:12:47.045
I pay my taxes and
it's awfully hard for me.


1407
01:12:47.112 --> 01:12:48.413
But I do and I think

1408
01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:52.784
if you're going to be a
citizen in this country,


1409
01:12:52.884 --> 01:12:54.252
you should pay your taxes

1410
01:12:54.319 --> 01:12:55.563
because you having all
the good benefits out of it.


1411
01:12:55.587 --> 01:12:58.123
Pay your taxes.

1412
01:13:03.161 --> 01:13:04.729
This is the homepage.

1413
01:13:04.796 --> 01:13:06.164
You'll notice no pop-ups,

1414
01:13:06.264 --> 01:13:08.600
no advertising
we're not selling anything.


1415
01:13:08.667 --> 01:13:10.468
They show an introduction.

1416
01:13:10.568 --> 01:13:11.836
If you're just interested

1417
01:13:11.937 --> 01:13:13.314
in how many Beanie
Babies there were,


1418
01:13:13.338 --> 01:13:17.676
we show a complete list
of every Beanie Baby ever made.


1419
01:13:17.776 --> 01:13:20.812
If we keep this up, we're gonna
have to open a small museum.


1420
01:13:20.912 --> 01:13:22.447
A small museum would be fun.

1421
01:13:22.514 --> 01:13:24.416
It would give me something
to do when I retire.


1422
01:13:24.482 --> 01:13:27.686
It will be a job for Sondra.

1423
01:13:29.454 --> 01:13:31.623
The one that everyone
asks about probably


1424
01:13:31.690 --> 01:13:33.925
the most hit page in our site

1425
01:13:33.992 --> 01:13:37.529
is the Princess
Beanie Baby values.


1426
01:13:38.964 --> 01:13:40.174
So if you look
at the average price


1427
01:13:40.198 --> 01:13:43.601
for the most valuable
princess on the Internet


1428
01:13:43.668 --> 01:13:47.839
it's at $57, which is much
lower than people believe.


1429
01:13:47.939 --> 01:13:49.283
Hello, everyone.
I'm Colleen Ballinger.


1430
01:13:49.307 --> 01:13:52.477
And I don't think I have
ever been this excited


1431
01:13:52.544 --> 01:13:53.712
for a YouTube video.

1432
01:13:53.812 --> 01:13:56.214
You might notice behind me
a pile of Beanie Babies.


1433
01:13:56.314 --> 01:14:00.185
Hey, what is up, you guys? It's
me, @lovekayray.


1434
01:14:00.285 --> 01:14:04.189
And today we are valuing
and selling our Beanie babies.


1435
01:14:08.193 --> 01:14:13.298
This Beanie Baby is worth $300.
That is insane.


1436
01:14:13.365 --> 01:14:17.736
I just scored four bins
of Beanie Babies


1437
01:14:17.836 --> 01:14:19.637
for 20 bucks total.

1438
01:14:19.704 --> 01:14:21.506
This guy's only worth about
seven bucks,


1439
01:14:21.573 --> 01:14:22.907
he's worth about seven bucks,

1440
01:14:23.008 --> 01:14:25.577
this guy is actually
worth about nine bucks.


1441
01:14:25.677 --> 01:14:27.012
Now, that doesn't
seem like a lot


1442
01:14:27.078 --> 01:14:29.014
but think about it,
the three guys right here


1443
01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:33.318
after shipping and fees,
I made all my money back.


1444
01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:35.253
I'm going on record,
it may not be true,


1445
01:14:35.353 --> 01:14:40.191
to say that I have the
world's largest collection


1446
01:14:40.258 --> 01:14:41.693
of Beanie Babies.

1447
01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:45.864
Elvis people, don't you want
the Elvis edition Beanie Baby?


1448
01:14:45.930 --> 01:14:48.700
That's got to be
a collector's item.


1449
01:14:48.767 --> 01:14:52.237
Somebody wants this thing.
'Cause I don't.


1450
01:14:52.337 --> 01:14:53.872
I want the money.

1451
01:14:57.375 --> 01:15:02.414
My mom started collecting
Beanie Babies around 1997.


1452
01:15:03.948 --> 01:15:09.888
For her, to collect this many
Beanie Babies, it took years.


1453
01:15:09.954 --> 01:15:11.289
I would tell her as a kid,

1454
01:15:11.389 --> 01:15:12.400
I think this could be
worth something one day


1455
01:15:12.424 --> 01:15:15.060
and she just kind of
held onto them.


1456
01:15:16.561 --> 01:15:18.396
I've never sold
a single Beanie Baby.


1457
01:15:18.463 --> 01:15:22.200
Not one.
I've just held onto them.


1458
01:15:22.267 --> 01:15:24.769
The collection themselves
and the connection to my mom


1459
01:15:24.869 --> 01:15:27.972
is the more intrinsic value
of them, I would say.


1460
01:15:28.073 --> 01:15:34.245
But there's a price.
I have my number.


1461
01:15:34.312 --> 01:15:36.614
I'll reserve what that is,
but I have my number.


1462
01:15:36.714 --> 01:15:37.916
But if it comes about

1463
01:15:37.982 --> 01:15:40.985
then the Beanie Baby collection
might not be here.


1464
01:15:46.558 --> 01:15:48.560
Mom, get in here. Wait.

1465
01:15:48.626 --> 01:15:51.096
Do you have something?
We might. Hold on.


1466
01:15:51.162 --> 01:15:52.730
I haven't even
looked for them yet


1467
01:15:52.797 --> 01:15:54.442
but one of the things it
says these international bears,


1468
01:15:54.466 --> 01:15:57.469
but it says if it's in
its original packaging.


1469
01:15:57.569 --> 01:16:00.338
Mom, why did you take it out
of the package?


1470
01:16:00.438 --> 01:16:01.673
Oh, my gosh.

1471
01:16:01.773 --> 01:16:03.651
I was getting tweets from fans
saying, "Oh, my gosh."


1472
01:16:03.675 --> 01:16:05.944
"I just looked up this
Beanie Baby and I have it."


1473
01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:08.346
"And it has this error on it."

1474
01:16:08.446 --> 01:16:11.816
So it kind of like started
everyone looking up


1475
01:16:11.916 --> 01:16:14.319
which Beanies they had to see
if they were worth anything.


1476
01:16:14.419 --> 01:16:17.956
Here's the Canada one
and it's not in the box.


1477
01:16:18.022 --> 01:16:19.023
Mom!

1478
01:16:19.124 --> 01:16:21.259
The YouTube video,
it was really fun.


1479
01:16:21.326 --> 01:16:22.927
We're gonna be rich!

1480
01:16:22.994 --> 01:16:26.030
And a great night for my mom
and I to have together.


1481
01:16:26.131 --> 01:16:27.465
Where's the camera?

1482
01:16:27.532 --> 01:16:29.367
- It's in the ring light.
- Oh.


1483
01:16:29.467 --> 01:16:31.202
Some of my best memories
from that time


1484
01:16:31.302 --> 01:16:34.806
were finding Beanie Babies and
collecting them with my mother.


1485
01:16:34.873 --> 01:16:37.876
I remember the feeling of it,
that's so bizarre.


1486
01:16:37.976 --> 01:16:39.210
Finding Beanie Babies

1487
01:16:39.310 --> 01:16:41.110
was one of the only things I
ever did with her


1488
01:16:41.146 --> 01:16:43.090
during that time of my life
that was special just for us.


1489
01:16:43.114 --> 01:16:45.717
This one's selling for $18.

1490
01:16:45.817 --> 01:16:47.886
I still feel like you could
sell them for a lot.


1491
01:16:47.986 --> 01:16:49.463
But that means part of your
childhood would go away.


1492
01:16:49.487 --> 01:16:52.123
It's, like, another bonding
moment for us, Mom.


1493
01:16:52.190 --> 01:16:55.393
We get to go through
this all again.


1494
01:16:55.493 --> 01:16:56.995
If another
beanie craze happened,


1495
01:16:57.061 --> 01:16:59.330
maybe my collection
would be worth something.


1496
01:16:59.397 --> 01:17:03.968
So I'm crossing my fingers
that another beanie craze


1497
01:17:04.035 --> 01:17:07.739
comes about 'cause I will make
so much money...


1498
01:17:07.839 --> 01:17:09.841
Probably not.

1499
01:17:11.009 --> 01:17:12.911
Now what's happening
with the market


1500
01:17:13.011 --> 01:17:15.580
is it's the grandchildren
coming around,


1501
01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:20.151
finding these tubs that
their grandparents left them,


1502
01:17:20.218 --> 01:17:22.420
revisiting this phenomenon.

1503
01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:25.690
I get them every day or a couple
of times during the day,


1504
01:17:25.757 --> 01:17:28.426
UPS automatically
sends me an email.


1505
01:17:32.597 --> 01:17:34.165
They want to make
sure they're authentic


1506
01:17:34.232 --> 01:17:37.202
and I think because
they're selling them on eBay.


1507
01:17:38.703 --> 01:17:41.005
No, because I love
Beanie Babies.


1508
01:17:41.072 --> 01:17:43.608
I don't get sick of it.

1509
01:17:45.043 --> 01:17:47.412
I charge, like, $25,

1510
01:17:47.512 --> 01:17:49.581
I bought display cases,

1511
01:17:49.681 --> 01:17:53.785
I got tamper-evident tape,
certificates.


1512
01:17:53.885 --> 01:17:57.288
This is the one I write all
the details of the Beanie Baby.


1513
01:17:57.388 --> 01:18:01.459
The generation,
the authentication number,


1514
01:18:01.559 --> 01:18:08.032
which would be...
number 125,878.


1515
01:18:11.436 --> 01:18:14.806
125,877.

1516
01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:16.640
Isn't that amazing?

1517
01:18:19.143 --> 01:18:23.147
It even shocks me.

1518
01:18:25.316 --> 01:18:26.618
Tape it on there.

1519
01:18:27.719 --> 01:18:28.987
And that's ready to go.

1520
01:18:31.389 --> 01:18:34.292
You know, a Beanie Baby
is just a thing.


1521
01:18:34.392 --> 01:18:35.402
What makes
the Beanie Baby come alive


1522
01:18:35.426 --> 01:18:37.762
is the stories
associated with it.


1523
01:18:37.829 --> 01:18:38.973
Who made it? How was it made?

1524
01:18:38.997 --> 01:18:41.499
Why was it collected?
How was it marketed?


1525
01:18:41.599 --> 01:18:44.636
And what does it say about
the people the collected them?


1526
01:18:46.104 --> 01:18:48.239
You know, sometimes
you reflect on it,


1527
01:18:48.306 --> 01:18:50.942
but you always go back
to the beginning.


1528
01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:55.446
Nobody really knows where
all this started.


1529
01:18:55.513 --> 01:18:57.181
But we do.

1530
01:18:57.282 --> 01:19:00.184
It was just
a little happy family.


1531
01:19:00.285 --> 01:19:02.153
And that's what's most
important to me


1532
01:19:02.253 --> 01:19:06.658
is the ones that I started out
with know exactly what we did.


1533
01:19:06.758 --> 01:19:11.696
Beanie Babies gave me first of
all a connection with my kids.


1534
01:19:11.796 --> 01:19:14.098
Especially in the beginning.

1535
01:19:14.165 --> 01:19:19.537
Of course, it brought
financial... um, success.


1536
01:19:19.637 --> 01:19:21.339
But if you're the
lucky owner of this,


1537
01:19:21.439 --> 01:19:22.449
this goes for about $4000.

1538
01:19:22.473 --> 01:19:26.344
It brought me
a lot of craziness.


1539
01:19:26.444 --> 01:19:29.647
But it brought
a lot of good things.


1540
01:19:31.716 --> 01:19:34.719
25 years, and
it just keeps going


1541
01:19:34.819 --> 01:19:36.854
and it happened by accident.

1542
01:19:39.223 --> 01:19:42.727
I do. Because I love them.
