00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.669
Hello people.

2
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.143
It's me, Jeremy again.

3
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.519
Today, I want to talk
about fight or flight.


4
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.159
Now, when you hear fight or flight,

5
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.049
you're usually thinking
about a threatening


6
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.419
situation where you have two options,

7
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.759
fight or flight.

8
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.163
Now, if you choose fight,

9
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.879
you're considered brave,

10
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.639
and courageous,

11
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.640
and bold.

12
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.189
But if you choose flight,

13
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.033
you're weak,

14
00:01:31.106 --> 00:01:32.106
and soft,

15
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.750
and a coward.

16
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.123
Why is that?

17
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.119
Because isn't fight or flight

18
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.853
supposed to achieve the same goal?

19
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.690
To live?

20
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.023
And why do we worry so much
about what other people think.


21
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.279
In high school, it's tough enough

22
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.163
without everyone judging you.

23
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.948
I guess all I
want in life is to...

24
00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.029
Jeremy, dinner's ready!

25
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.293
Coming mom!

26
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.613
You know what?

27
00:02:16.614 --> 00:02:18.266
Forget it, alright?

28
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.779
I just want people to
mind their own business


29
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.549
and just live the life
that they wanna live.


30
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.920
You know, and I hope that one day

31
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.350
I'll be able to live a life
I'm happy to live with.


32
00:02:35.207 --> 00:02:36.707
To live out my own dreams.

33
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.070
Peace out, people.

Hey Tiff!

67
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.309
Morning Jeremy.

68
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.869
Hey!

69
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.159
Whoa, what's up with you today?

70
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.299
You seem happy?

71
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.429
Well, it's my birthday in two days,

72
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.922
and I'm really excited to be 18.

73
00:04:28.923 --> 00:04:30.226
Okay, so is that why you're doing

74
00:04:30.227 --> 00:04:31.526
a lot of selfies and posting?

75
00:04:31.527 --> 00:04:33.375
You know it.

76
00:04:33.376 --> 00:04:34.865
I'm excited for you, babe.

77
00:04:34.866 --> 00:04:36.419
Thank you!

78
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.849
All right, I have to go
before Ms. Morris has a fit.


79
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.959
I think she just hates that

80
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.089
I look prettier than her in pink.

81
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.800
Well, you look prettier
in just about anything.


82
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:49.801
Stop.

83
00:04:50.822 --> 00:04:51.822
Boo!

84
00:04:52.563 --> 00:04:53.969
What the hell, Jules!

85
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.053
You scared me.

86
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.689
I still can't believe you love Tiffany.

87
00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.709
She's a fake, Jeremy.

88
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.999
When are you gonna realize that?

89
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.279
Look, I know that you like Tiffany,

90
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.509
but she isn't gay, okay?

91
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.967
So you can just stop that.

92
00:05:04.968 --> 00:05:05.969
Yeah, me?

93
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:06.803
Like Tiffany?

94
00:05:06.804 --> 00:05:08.133
- Yeah.
- Yeah, in your dreams.


95
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.440
I think Alexis is better than her anyway.

96
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.659
Wait, since when did you and Alexis,

97
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.239
you know, become a thing?

98
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.640
It's been a few weeks now.

99
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:21.970
Good luck.

100
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.869
But I don't need your advice, okay?

101
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.319
Just stay outta my business
and I'll stay outta yours.


102
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.320
I got this.

103
00:05:30.133 --> 00:05:31.383
Hey Jeremy, look at me.

104
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.949
Jules, I told you to stop doing that.

105
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.839
Sorry, I can't help it.

106
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.569
Your cheeks, they're kinda
like a magnet for my hand,


107
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.979
plus I love doing it way too much.

108
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.368
Go away, Jules.

109
00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:47.339
Fine.

110
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.940
But just remember I told you so.

111
00:05:58.647 --> 00:05:59.480
Hi.

112
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:00.979
Oh!

113
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.441
Hi, Dr. Vasan.

114
00:06:02.442 --> 00:06:03.317
I know, I know,

115
00:06:03.318 --> 00:06:05.643
No cell phones, I'm
putting it away right now.


116
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:07.780
Wait a minute.

117
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.629
So how are you and your
mom doing since everything?


118
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.869
Oh, my mom's good,

119
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.403
I'm good, we are good.

120
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.250
We don't need him.

121
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.423
I'm gonna get to class, can't be tardy.

122
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.319
So Tiff, um,

123
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.789
you're going to homecoming with me, right?

124
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.349
Hey!

125
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.583
Yeah, of course.

126
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.239
Okay, so you can
come by and have dinner

127
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.489
with me and my family tonight?

128
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.693
Tonight?

129
00:06:45.694 --> 00:06:48.959
I can't 'cause my brother's
getting back from India,


130
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.273
so, rain check?

131
00:06:51.274 --> 00:06:52.107
Yeah, sure.

132
00:06:52.107 --> 00:06:52.940
Next time.

133
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:53.873
Yeah, next time.

134
00:06:53.873 --> 00:06:54.706
Hey Tiff.

135
00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:55.746
Hey, call me later okay?

136
00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.793
So how about next week?

137
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.369
Yeah,

138
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.220
let me get back
to you on that, okay?

139
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.820
Hey!

140
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.115
I love you.

141
00:07:12.116 --> 00:07:13.966
Love you too.

142
00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:15.783
Oh hey, this is my ride.

143
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.339
We can do dinner, but you
know what I'd really love?


144
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.629
What's that?

145
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:22.799
Sundae Shakes.

146
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.629
I love their cheesy fries.

147
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.630

Me?

155
00:07:47.087 --> 00:07:50.069
Not really, but maybe one day.

156
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.106
Could have fooled me.

157
00:07:52.107 --> 00:07:53.639
You might as well be one now.

158
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.473
Why?

159
00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.013
Have you seen yourself?

160
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:57.850
You're gorgeous.

161
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.120
Thank you.

162
00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:06.691
Hey, wait.

163
00:08:06.692 --> 00:08:09.273
A face like yours should
be on billboards downtown.


164
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.909
I got a friend who runs an agency.

165
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.349
Would you be interested?

166
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.340
I could connect you two.

167
00:08:14.341 --> 00:08:16.199
An agency, like a modeling agency?

168
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.319
Yeah, so what do you say?

169
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.938
Um, I don't,

170
00:08:20.939 --> 00:08:22.829
I don't know.

171
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.248
I'll have to think about it.

172
00:08:24.249 --> 00:08:25.082
Okay, look,

173
00:08:25.083 --> 00:08:28.079
I only refer girls to him if
I think they have something.


174
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.741
When I see you, 
I see something.

175
00:08:30.742 --> 00:08:32.073
You could be a big star.

176
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.279
All you gotta do is
just send him an email.


177
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.730
This could be your big break.

178
00:08:43.093 --> 00:08:46.940
Okay.

179
00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:48.749
Look, just email him,

180
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.346
tell him Richard sent you.

181
00:08:50.347 --> 00:08:53.319
You could make some money out of it.

182
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.291
Okay, thanks.

183
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.340
Boo!

184
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.269
Boy, stop sneaking up on me like that.

185
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.937
Where have you been?

186
00:09:40.938 --> 00:09:42.723
Just hanging out with Tiffany?

187
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.449
Oh, Tiffany.

188
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.469
How is she doing?

189
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.399
I seen some of her little selfies.

190
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.723
Is she keeping warm?

191
00:09:52.988 --> 00:09:53.821
Yes, mom.

192
00:09:53.822 --> 00:09:55.439
She is!

193
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.919
You know, she just
trying to be a model.

194
00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.760
Hmm, oh.

195
00:09:59.761 --> 00:10:04.054
So I made some of your
favorite, honey garlic chicken.


196
00:10:04.055 --> 00:10:04.888
For real?

197
00:10:04.889 --> 00:10:06.449
Uh-huh, your dad will be home soon,

198
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.399
so clean your room and get
started on that homework,


199
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.233
all right?

200
00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:10.233
All right.

201
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.593
So how was work?

202
00:10:19.594 --> 00:10:20.772
Stressful.

203
00:10:20.773 --> 00:10:22.139
But I will tell you what?

204
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.479
I sure am looking forward to
our little vacation coming up.


205
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.480
Me too!

206
00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:28.290
Ew, guys.

207
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.290
Ugh.

208
00:10:30.833 --> 00:10:31.666
Stop.

209
00:10:31.667 --> 00:10:33.583
So son, how's school?

210
00:10:35.459 --> 00:10:37.121
It's fine, dad.

211
00:10:37.122 --> 00:10:39.381
You're going to homecoming, right?

212
00:10:39.382 --> 00:10:41.215
Yeah, with Tiffany.

213
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.720
Tiffany?

214
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.166
Son, how many times
do I gotta tell you?

215
00:10:46.167 --> 00:10:48.213
You gotta watch out for girls like that!

216
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.089
George.

217
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.286
Jeremy likes her, let it go.

218
00:10:53.287 --> 00:10:55.349
Baby, I'm just trying
to protect the boy.


219
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.149
I don't wanna see him get hurt.

220
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.969
Sooner or later, she's going to leave him.

221
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.773
Dad, you don't know that.

222
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.593
Jeremy, eat your food.

223
00:11:06.096 --> 00:11:08.179
George, leave him alone.

224
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.553
Tiffany's not gonna leave me.

225
00:11:17.188 --> 00:11:19.684
All right, all right.

226
00:11:25.708 --> 00:11:26.969
- Hey.
- What do you want, Ethan?


227
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.893
Thing is, help me out?

228
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:30.929
What did I tell you about turning

229
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.403
up on my doorstep this late?

230
00:11:33.886 --> 00:11:36.179
You said to call, but I'm sorry,

231
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.879
I just figured you'd be good
for it, if you don't mind.


232
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.880
But I do mind.

233
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.169
Please Hunter, come on.

234
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.729
Just a little.

235
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:45.780
I'll be out the door.

236
00:11:48.908 --> 00:11:50.709
Come on in.

237
00:11:53.857 --> 00:11:56.307
I've been seeing your girl
post a lot of selfies.


238
00:11:57.788 --> 00:11:58.788
What?

239
00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:00.850
Your girl.

240
00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.540
She's been posting a lot of selfies.

241
00:12:06.547 --> 00:12:08.595
She's not my girl.

242
00:12:08.596 --> 00:12:09.596
For real?

243
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.850
What happened between you two?

244
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:35.920
I'm not gonna tell you again.

245
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:38.950
You better call next time.

246
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:41.350
Yeah, sorry.

247
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.579
Jeremy, Tiffany's fighting with Ethan!

248
00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.213
What?

249
00:13:41.895 --> 00:13:44.342
One more word about Jeremy
and you're dead, Ethan.


250
00:13:44.343 --> 00:13:46.109
Who, that nerdy Black kid?

251
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.943
Tiff, he's a coward.

252
00:13:46.944 --> 00:13:48.629
What is your problem with him anyway?

253
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.089
It's not like he
ever did anything to you.

254
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:51.060
He didn't do anything to me?

255
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.050
He stole you away from me!

256
00:13:52.051 --> 00:13:54.813
We were over before
we even started, Ethan.


257
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.518
Jeremy, come show Ethan that
you're not afraid of him.


258
00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:03.149
You know, you might look tough,

259
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.529
but you're pathetic.

260
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:05.490
Jeremy and I are together.

261
00:14:05.491 --> 00:14:07.709
You're just gonna have to deal with it.

262
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:11.368
Besides, you're too self-centered
to even care about me.


263
00:14:11.369 --> 00:14:12.696
What are you looking at?

264
00:14:12.697 --> 00:14:13.979
If you've got any balls,

265
00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.859
then step out from behind your girlfriend.

266
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:17.860
What's up?

267
00:14:21.233 --> 00:14:22.463
Jeremy?

268
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.499
See?

269
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.500
What a coward.

270
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.980
All right, all right.

271
00:14:31.981 --> 00:14:33.030
What's going on here?

272
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.023
You all need to get to class.

273
00:14:35.024 --> 00:14:36.287
Leave!

274
00:14:36.288 --> 00:14:38.634
Get to your classes.

275
00:14:43.878 --> 00:14:45.128
Come with me.

276
00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.579
Ethan, what happened?

277
00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.580
Nothing.

278
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.719
Coach Fields said you are
not playing football this year.


279
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.720
Why not?

280
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.310
I don't feel like playing.

281
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.280
How are you and your father doing?

282
00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.369
Ethan.

283
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.769
Sometimes the pain we feel leads us

284
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:25.139
to make destructive decisions.

285
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.140
We done?

286
00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.349
Ethan.

287
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.319
There are some people who care about you.

288
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.539
My door is always open.

289
00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.693
You can come here anytime
if you need to talk.


290
00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:43.739
Nobody cares about me.

291
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.003
So Jeremy, what are you going to do?

292
00:16:19.764 --> 00:16:20.597
Huh?

293
00:16:20.598 --> 00:16:22.323
What are you going to do?

294
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.339
I was gonna go to class.

295
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.749
I mean, I don't,

296
00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.129
you know, hang out in the hallways...

297
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.469
This is your senior year.

298
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:32.909
You are coming to in this year

299
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:36.363
with 4.2 GPA and a great attendance.

300
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.293
Oh, I really don't
know what I'm gonna do.


301
00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.890
I'm sorry, is this about
what happened earlier?


302
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.560
Jeremy.

303
00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.939
You are among the few students who have

304
00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.673
a perfect grade point
average in this school.


305
00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.553
It says a lot.

306
00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.782
Do you know what that means?

307
00:17:02.783 --> 00:17:07.409
I don't know, that I
do a lot of homework?


308
00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:08.613
Valedictorian.

309
00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.169
Not only that, it means
you need to be a leader,


310
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:14.170
not be a follower.

311
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.719
Not a leader, just a regular guy.

312
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.734
Got a great GPA,

313
00:17:20.735 --> 00:17:24.423
and I can't even stand up for myself.

314
00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:30.059
Being a leader is not
about fighting, but strength.


315
00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.999
It's about you being an influence

316
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.253
and not being influenced by others.

317
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:41.013
You have to guide your peers
and not to be led by the crowd.


318
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.110
You understand?

319
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.313
Go and think about it.

320
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.637
Now you can go to your class.

321
00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:55.349
About Ethan, okay,

322
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.949
I didn't think he was gonna
come at me like that and...


323
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.367
Enjoy the rest of your day.

00:18:04.753 --> 00:18:06.820

329
00:18:18.847 --> 00:18:20.014
Hey!

330
00:18:21.322 --> 00:18:24.213
Hey.

331
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.339
Look at me, Jeremy.

332
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.929
What happened?

333
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:29.069
I just hate fights.

334
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.709
I know that, but Tiffany's pissed.

335
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.584
She feels like you embarrassed her.

336
00:18:33.585 --> 00:18:35.339
No, but I can't fight Ethan.

337
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.829
You know he's
not gonna let this go.


338
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:38.760
Yeah, I know.

339
00:18:38.761 --> 00:18:41.159
And Tiffany, what are
you gonna do about that?


340
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.009
Just gonna have to
apologize to her, I guess.


341
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.739
Okay, but not a plain apology,

342
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:47.730
a cute, sweet,

343
00:18:47.731 --> 00:18:49.486
romantic apology?

344
00:18:49.487 --> 00:18:52.559
I don't know if
I can do that, Jules,

345
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.613
but I'll try!

346
00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.665
Do or
do not, there is no trying.


347
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:10.949
Thanks Jules.

348
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.509
Nah, keep your thank you's.

349
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.461
Just have your mom make me some
of her honey garlic chicken.


350
00:19:15.462 --> 00:19:16.662
Done.

351
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.209
But seriously, you can't
let people punk you like that.


352
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.259
Okay, I know,

353
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.549
alright?

354
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:24.929
I know!

355
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.230
Well, at least you know.

356
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.639
Anyway, I gotta get home
and do some studying.


357
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.689
I have a test tomorrow in history

358
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.040
and would hate to get an F.

359
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.600
See you!

360
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:37.983
Hey Jules, wait.

361
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:44.710
Thanks.

362
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.293
Jeremy, you know I didn't do hugs.

363
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.169
Ah, whatever.

364
00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:53.943
- Bye.
- Bye!


365
00:20:20.898 --> 00:20:22.559
Hey Tiff.

366
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.560
Jeremy, stop!

367
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.624
Sorry about what happened earlier, okay?

368
00:20:31.625 --> 00:20:32.458
I just couldn't...

369
00:20:32.459 --> 00:20:34.529
What couldn't you do, Jeremy?

370
00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:35.363
Fight for me?

371
00:20:35.364 --> 00:20:37.109
Show Ethan that you weren't a coward?

372
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:38.663
'Cause yeah, you couldn't do that.

373
00:20:38.664 --> 00:20:39.497
Look, it's not like that.

374
00:20:39.498 --> 00:20:42.063
I don't want to hear
another word, Jeremy.


375
00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.029
I thought you were special,

376
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.109
different from other guys,

377
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.159
and I guess you are,

378
00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.249
just not in the way I
thought you would be.


379
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.083
Tiffany.

380
00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:51.916
I know, okay?

381
00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:54.329
And I'm not even too proud
about what happened either.


382
00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:55.163
Alright?

383
00:20:55.163 --> 00:20:55.996
But just understand that sometimes I can...

384
00:20:55.996 --> 00:20:56.910
There's nothing to understand, Jeremy.

385
00:20:56.911 --> 00:20:58.649
No, you're a coward.

386
00:20:58.650 --> 00:20:59.490
You can't fight for me,

387
00:20:59.491 --> 00:21:00.899
and you can't even fight for yourself,

388
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.579
and I'm done.

389
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:03.420
Tiffany wait, okay?

390
00:21:03.421 --> 00:21:05.639
I wish it didn't
have to come to this,

391
00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.346
but today you proved to
me that I need a man,


392
00:21:07.347 --> 00:21:09.471
and you're still a little boy.

393
00:21:09.472 --> 00:21:12.147
Even Ethan was willing to fight for me.

394
00:21:12.148 --> 00:21:13.030
Tiffany, just hear me out...

395
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:13.920
Goodbye Jeremy.

396
00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.908
Tiffany wait, let me just say...

397
00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:16.307
No Jeremy, I'm done!

398
00:21:26.795 --> 00:21:30.032
♪ Checked off your list of goodbyes ♪

399
00:21:30.033 --> 00:21:32.191
♪ You're sick of Saturday nights ♪

400
00:21:32.192 --> 00:21:35.766

401
00:21:35.767 --> 00:21:36.908
♪ You ain't got time ♪

402
00:22:16.962 --> 00:22:19.379
Just a stupid coward, yeah.

403
00:22:29.287 --> 00:22:31.368
You think I should do this?

404
00:23:09.782 --> 00:23:11.076
Where were you?

405
00:23:11.077 --> 00:23:13.410
I was at a friend's house.

406
00:23:14.863 --> 00:23:16.030
Come inside.

407
00:23:25.511 --> 00:23:27.029
What did I tell you about
coming in this house drunk?


408
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.139
I'm sorry dad, I
wouldn't have come home.


409
00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.322
I didn't know you were home.

410
00:23:29.323 --> 00:23:30.156
No, no, no.

411
00:23:30.157 --> 00:23:31.439
Sorry is not gonna cut it tonight.

412
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.690
Please, just...

413
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:41.340
You know the rules, boy.

414
00:23:41.341 --> 00:23:43.174
Dad, please!

415
00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:49.953
You need to understand the
value of hard work, Ethan.


416
00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.048
No more drinking and partying!

417
00:23:53.881 --> 00:23:54.874
Dad, dad, please, please.

418
00:23:54.874 --> 00:23:55.707
I won't drink again!

419
00:23:55.707 --> 00:23:56.540
Please...

420
00:23:56.541 --> 00:23:58.381
How dare you raise your
voice at me, shut up.


421
00:23:59.977 --> 00:24:03.453
I thought I would give you a chance,

422
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:07.147
but you know what?

423
00:24:07.148 --> 00:24:10.953
You are the biggest
disappointment in my life.


424
00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:16.829
You're grounded for a month.

425
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.559
I want you to come
straight home from school.


426
00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.110
You understand what I'm saying?

427
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.169
Do you understand what I'm saying?

428
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:26.170
Yes, sir.

429
00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:34.850
I work hard, and all he
does is drink and have fun.


430
00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.827
Who the hell is that?

431
00:25:08.965 --> 00:25:10.353
Caitlin!

432
00:25:10.354 --> 00:25:11.187
Hi!

433
00:25:11.188 --> 00:25:14.009
Hey, what are you doing here?

434
00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.049
Actually, I brought you some

435
00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.969
leftover apple pie from the get together.

436
00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:19.769
I thought you and your
son would like some.


437
00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:21.393
Yes, thank you.

438
00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.790
That's very thoughtful of you.

439
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:25.630
You're welcome.

440
00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:31.317
Would you like to come inside
and have a glass of wine or?


441
00:25:32.784 --> 00:25:34.738
That is so sweet of you,

442
00:25:34.739 --> 00:25:36.779
but I think I must pass.

443
00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.583
I have already had too much tonight.

444
00:25:39.714 --> 00:25:40.714
So.

445
00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.460
Come on.

446
00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:45.959
Please?

447
00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.519
Come on, just a glass,

448
00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.520
or half a glass!

449
00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:51.299
All right, okay.

450
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.236
Half a glass can't hurt, so.

451
00:25:54.237 --> 00:25:55.320
Can't hurt!

452
00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.077
Hm, delicious.

453
00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:15.696
Thank you.

454
00:26:15.697 --> 00:26:18.239
Yeah, my sister got
it for me in France.

455
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.240
That's amazing.

456
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.719
You know, I could get you a bottle.

457
00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.720
Really?

458
00:26:26.607 --> 00:26:28.649
I would love to share
this with my husband.


459
00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:29.650
Thank you, Tim.

460
00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:34.253
No problem.

461
00:26:39.974 --> 00:26:42.474
I should probably leave now.

462
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.820
Ah, it's getting late.

463
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:50.642
Okay.

464
00:26:50.643 --> 00:26:52.493
- Thank you.
- Sure.


465
00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.029
So I will see you later then?

466
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:05.669
Sure, you know where I live.

467
00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:07.773
Yes, thank you Tim.

468
00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.503
Don't mention it.

469
00:27:10.504 --> 00:27:13.288
Yeah.

470
00:27:13.289 --> 00:27:17.609
What if I stop by again
tomorrow night around this time?


471
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:19.589
My husband's in Canada for business, so.

472
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:20.777
Yes!

473
00:27:20.778 --> 00:27:23.759
Yes, that would be great.

474
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.223
All right, well it's a date.

475
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.140
It's a date.

476
00:27:31.235 --> 00:27:32.235
Okay, bye.

477
00:27:52.497 --> 00:27:53.939
Boo!

478
00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.429
Jules, I told you to stop doing that.

479
00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:57.843
Sorry, I can't help it.

480
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.783
Anyway, how are you doing?

481
00:28:02.625 --> 00:28:04.379
I just feel...

482
00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.380
Empty?

483
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:07.709
Yeah.

484
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:09.599
Hey, think positive.

485
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.519
One, because I hate negative people,

486
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.470
and two, because thinking
negatively won't do you any good.


487
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:17.819
Look, Jeremy.

488
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:18.959
I get it.

489
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.839
I won't even tell you to forget
about Tiffany or anything.


490
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.029
I just know you'll find
someone better than her.


491
00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:27.029
You know she's not the
only fish in the pond.


492
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.129
Jules, it's fish in the sea.

493
00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.130
Yeah, same thing.

494
00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.059
Oh, I almost forgot.

495
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:34.529
Did you hear about Ethan?

496
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:35.639
No, what happened?

497
00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.630
I heard he went to a party

498
00:28:36.631 --> 00:28:38.009
the other night and came home late,

499
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:40.169
and his dad got pissed and
beat the hell out of him.


500
00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:41.729
- Really?
- Uh-huh.


501
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:44.069
Nelson said he was with this guy, Hunter.

502
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.089
We've heard of him, haven't you?

503
00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.379
Yeah, I read about him in a couple

504
00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.839
of newspapers like that before.

505
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.949
Newspapers?

506
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:52.923
Seriously Jeremy, what
century are you living in?


507
00:28:53.952 --> 00:28:55.083
Hey, quiet!

508
00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.289
Whatever.

509
00:28:58.290 --> 00:28:59.969
Now Ethan didn't come to school today

510
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:03.005
and Nelson's too scared to go
to his house and check on him.


511
00:29:03.006 --> 00:29:05.586
Man, I'm pretty sure
Ethan would be okay.


512
00:29:05.587 --> 00:29:08.369
I just hope he doesn't come
back until after graduation.


513
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:10.649
You know, I still feel bad for him.

514
00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:12.179
Okay sure, he's a bully,

515
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.369
but what his dad did still isn't right.

516
00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:15.629
Forget about Ethan, okay?

517
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.369
Look, I need you right now.

518
00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:18.203
All right?

519
00:29:18.204 --> 00:29:19.919
And you're the only
one that I can talk to.


520
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.373
You're just mad that
Ethan punked you, that's it.


521
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.149
But you know, I may have to agree

522
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:29.699
with Tiffany a little bit on this one.

523
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.169
Jules, not you too.

524
00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:32.003
No, like,

525
00:29:32.004 --> 00:29:33.509
believe it or not, she's right.

526
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.253
You are a bit of a coward.

527
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:37.709
Bye Jules.

528
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:38.667
No, look.

529
00:29:38.668 --> 00:29:41.159
Can you just step
it up and be brave?

530
00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.769
Be that night in shining
armor for Tiffany.


531
00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:46.139
If not Tiffany, then for someone else.

532
00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.279
The point is sometimes you need

533
00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.830
to put up your fists and fight.

534
00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:50.873
You know me.

535
00:29:50.874 --> 00:29:52.810
No matter what, I'll
always be here for you.


536
00:29:53.749 --> 00:29:56.523
But Jeremy, you need to
stop being so scared.


537
00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.360
Scared?

538
00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.249
Don't you tell me about being scared.

539
00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:03.869
You're the one that's
scared to tell your parents


540
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:05.520
about what the piano teacher did.

541
00:30:06.934 --> 00:30:09.543
Can you two keep it quiet, please.

542
00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:13.523
Jules, look.

543
00:30:13.523 --> 00:30:14.523
I'm sorry!

544
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.160
Way to go, Jeremy.

545
00:30:31.099 --> 00:30:32.099
Ms Smith?

546
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:35.095
Is everything okay.

547
00:30:35.096 --> 00:30:38.039
Yeah, I just can't get this damn.

548
00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.390
I can't get my locker open.

549
00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:44.330
Go and wait in my office.

550
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.559
Tell me the number.

551
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.613
17.

552
00:30:51.574 --> 00:30:52.908
17.

553
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:54.328
32.

554
00:30:54.329 --> 00:30:55.162
32.

555
00:30:55.162 --> 00:30:56.162
17.

556
00:30:56.894 --> 00:30:57.894
17.

557
00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:01.649
Open!

558
00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:03.299
Thanks.

559
00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.279
I know it can be hard to find

560
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.499
the words when you are hurting,

561
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.813
but sometimes it helps to try.

562
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.500
For all of us.

563
00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:22.577
Oh my God.

564
00:31:24.307 --> 00:31:25.890
That feels so good.

565
00:31:27.392 --> 00:31:29.847
Where did you learn to do that?

566
00:31:29.848 --> 00:31:32.313
I have always been good with my hands.

567
00:31:33.967 --> 00:31:36.071
I bet you are.

568
00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.115
I actually thought about
going to school for this.


569
00:31:40.116 --> 00:31:41.116
Oh?

570
00:31:43.353 --> 00:31:44.353
Oh!

571
00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.537
Where's Hunter?

572
00:33:14.573 --> 00:33:16.256
Who is it?

573
00:33:16.257 --> 00:33:18.627
Yo, it's me, Ethan.

574
00:33:18.628 --> 00:33:19.711
Come on in.

575
00:33:25.223 --> 00:33:26.636
Woo!

576
00:33:26.637 --> 00:33:28.443
Now that's what I call a kick.

577
00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.993
So what do you need today?

578
00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.293
Just the usual.

579
00:33:42.039 --> 00:33:43.166
I don't got it.

580
00:33:43.167 --> 00:33:45.631
But I promise you, you
know I'm good for 100.


581
00:33:45.632 --> 00:33:46.653
I'll get it.

582
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:50.543
You know I don't play about my money.

583
00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:53.620
You know the rules.

584
00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:58.173
First the money, and then
you can get the candies.


585
00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.483
I mean, this is all I have,

586
00:34:02.484 --> 00:34:05.009
all I've got right now.

587
00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.769
Are you seriously
joking with me right now?


588
00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:08.909
You think you can just come up here

589
00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:09.989
and do whatever you please?

590
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:12.059
You think I'm gonna give you quality

591
00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.560
stuff for a couple of dollars?

592
00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.200
Huh?

593
00:34:16.201 --> 00:34:17.307
It's all I got.

594
00:34:18.333 --> 00:34:19.769
Then get the hell
out of here before I

595
00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:21.920
slice your balls off
and throw them to her.


596
00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.013
You'd love them, wouldn't you?

597
00:34:28.248 --> 00:34:29.669
I'm sorry, Hunter.

598
00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:30.670
Get out.

599
00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:32.410
Get out!

600
00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:53.399
Hey!

601
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.233
What?

602
00:34:54.233 --> 00:34:55.066
What's wrong?

603
00:34:55.066 --> 00:34:55.899
What do you want from me?

604
00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.619
What the hell happened to your eye?

605
00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.389
Okay, don't answer,

606
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:03.234
but I can get you some
candies if you want.


607
00:35:03.235 --> 00:35:04.388
How?

608
00:35:04.389 --> 00:35:08.056
♪ Low, I don't want you low ♪

609
00:35:30.423 --> 00:35:31.423
He's gone.

610
00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.829
Yeah, you sure he's
got what we need though?


611
00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:36.495
Trust me.

612
00:35:36.496 --> 00:35:38.039
All right, where's it at?

613
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.439
Look in the master
bathroom, under the sink.


614
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.263
He keeps it in a black
box with a red top on it.


615
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:52.223
Hurry up!

616
00:35:52.224 --> 00:35:53.429
Why don't you wake up the whole

617
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:54.983
neighborhood while you're at it?

618
00:36:49.495 --> 00:36:50.480
Woo, it's cold.

619
00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.313
Go on in, baby.

620
00:36:51.314 --> 00:36:52.349
It's so cold...

621
00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:53.450
Welcome to my house!

622
00:36:54.425 --> 00:36:55.649
Wow, it's beautiful.

623
00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:57.130
Let me take this off you.

624
00:37:06.256 --> 00:37:07.506
Just traveling.

625
00:37:10.208 --> 00:37:12.259
Anyway, how about it?

626
00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:13.343
How about it?

627
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.409
I can't believe that he
pulled that off, can you?


628
00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:23.909
Oh my God, I can't either.

629
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:27.506
While we're in, I am so glad
Kendall introduced me to you.


630
00:37:27.507 --> 00:37:29.489
I'm so glad too.

631
00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:31.140
You look so hot in that outfit.

632
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:36.243
We can talk about
that a little bit later.

633
00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.833
But first talk about this.

634
00:37:52.076 --> 00:37:52.938
- Did you hear that...
- What was that?


635
00:37:52.939 --> 00:37:54.188
I don't know.

636
00:38:00.097 --> 00:38:01.097
Hold still.

637
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.009
Do you lure guys
like that all the time?

638
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:33.479
Lure?

639
00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.313
Look.

640
00:38:34.314 --> 00:38:35.609
You almost got me killed.

641
00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:38.160
You gotta do what you
gotta do to survive, right?


642
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:46.890
Wait!

643
00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:52.162
There's no need to rush.

644
00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:53.909
What about Hunter?

645
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:55.589
What about him?

646
00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:56.853
He doesn't own me.

647
00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.569
Why, are you scared of him?

648
00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:02.300
No, um...

649
00:39:04.716 --> 00:39:06.059
I should go.

650
00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:06.893
Are you sure?

651
00:39:06.894 --> 00:39:08.643
I've got the room all night.

652
00:39:11.776 --> 00:39:13.567
Yeah, yeah, I should go.

653
00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:17.211
All right, I'll see you around.

00:40:22.761 --> 00:40:25.664
Jeremy?

673
00:40:25.665 --> 00:40:26.665
Jeremy?

674
00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:28.420
Boy?

675
00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.229
Dad, I told you to
knock before you come in.


676
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:33.119
I did knock, and I called
your name three times.


677
00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.183
What are you doing, listening
to that mumble music?


678
00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.589
Listen, your mother and I
are leaving first thing.


679
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:38.423
We'll be gone a week.

680
00:40:38.424 --> 00:40:41.069
You can have one or two
friends over, but no parties.


681
00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:42.070
Understand?

682
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.990
Alright.

683
00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:48.779
Listen, be careful wearing
that hoodie around town.


684
00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.369
You heard about what happened
to that boy in Florida.


685
00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:52.431
He was the same age as you.

686
00:40:52.432 --> 00:40:53.639
So when you walking
through this neighborhood,


687
00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.959
don't have that hoodie up.

688
00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:58.088
Some people might be
scaredy scared of you.


689
00:40:58.089 --> 00:41:00.112
Scared of me?

690
00:41:00.113 --> 00:41:01.113
Yeah right.

691
00:41:02.137 --> 00:41:03.423
Love you, son.

692
00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:05.350
Love you too, dad.

693
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:07.583
Oh, one more thing.

694
00:41:07.583 --> 00:41:08.416
Make sure...

695
00:41:08.417 --> 00:41:10.067
George, I'm ready!

696
00:41:10.068 --> 00:41:11.913
You know what, nevermind.

697
00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:14.110
Ugh, nasty.

698
00:41:21.627 --> 00:41:22.460
All right, all right.

699
00:41:22.461 --> 00:41:24.445
All right, settle down.

700
00:41:24.446 --> 00:41:26.196
Excuse me, thank you.

701
00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:28.679
All right.

702
00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.556
So today we're gonna do a
little writing assignment.


703
00:41:32.763 --> 00:41:35.309
Come on, guys.

704
00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:36.143
Believe me.

705
00:41:36.144 --> 00:41:39.063
It's not going to be easy,
but the topic is fear.


706
00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:43.499
Many of us have one fear or
another hidden inside of us,


707
00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:46.529
and it could be the fear of spiders,

708
00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:49.199
or the fear of darkness,

709
00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.319
or even the fear of embarrassment,

710
00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.879
but it is there.

711
00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.979
And so what I want you
to do is I want you

712
00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.499
to write on the story behind that fear.

713
00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:59.669
You guys get me?

714
00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:01.409
Yes, sir.

715
00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:02.609
Perfect!

716
00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:04.709
All right then, if you have any questions,

717
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:05.759
please raise your hand.

718
00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:09.029
Otherwise, take out your
pens and your pencils,


719
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:11.339
and let's start writing.

720
00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.189
Do not rush.

721
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:15.580
Let's get it done, people.

722
00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:47.183
Hey, Jeremy.

723
00:42:47.183 --> 00:42:48.183
Hey.

724
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:20.373
Hey, where's Tyler?

725
00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.369
Hey Jeremy.

726
00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:30.419
Hey Jason!

727
00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:31.919
Nice costume, man.

728
00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.753
Yeah, thanks man.

729
00:43:32.753 --> 00:43:33.586
You too!

730
00:43:33.587 --> 00:43:35.449
I don't see your toast?

731
00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:38.079
Yeah, I haven't found him yet.

732
00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.303
Alright, well,

733
00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.573
alright man, enjoy the party.

734
00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.449
Look at this as your own house.

735
00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:46.983
Not my words, Tyler's.

736
00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:50.223
- Okay.
- See you, bro.


737
00:44:27.277 --> 00:44:29.132
You got this, Jeremy.

738
00:44:29.133 --> 00:44:30.959
You got it, just go over there.

739
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.443
Just say hey, how you doing?

740
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.343
Just do it, come on.

741
00:44:45.107 --> 00:44:46.107
Hey.

742
00:44:47.404 --> 00:44:49.529
Looks like I found my toast.

743
00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:50.639
Don't get me started.

744
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.051
This is my sister's, and it sucks.

745
00:44:53.052 --> 00:44:54.993
I wish this party would just end.

746
00:44:55.911 --> 00:44:58.589
Hey, the party's not that bad.

747
00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:01.411
They've got beer, they've got music.

748
00:45:01.412 --> 00:45:03.512
And there's Sheila and Tyler making out.

749
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:08.880
So that's where he's been all this time.

750
00:45:08.881 --> 00:45:11.129
Like why can't they just
do all of that in the room?


751
00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:12.543
Tell me about it.

752
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:15.569
And that's why I hate parties.

753
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:17.403
Especially costume parties.

754
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:20.429
You know, the party's not that bad!

755
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:21.263
I mean, sure,

756
00:45:21.264 --> 00:45:22.709
they're over there feeding
on each others faces,


757
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:26.073
but that's only because they've
been going out for a while.


758
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.999
So we have a Tyler fan here, huh?

759
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.109
Okay, whoa.

760
00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:33.183
No, he's just my best friend.

761
00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:36.989
Okay, this party does suck.

762
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:40.003
Yeah.

763
00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.093
So what's your name?

764
00:45:47.857 --> 00:45:49.949
You know, I'm actually
not that comfortable


765
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:52.709
saying my name to a complete stranger.

766
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:54.389
A stranger?

767
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:57.149
I think we shared more than 100 words,

768
00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:59.939
which, yeah,

769
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:01.533
that makes us not strangers.

770
00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:04.480
It's Jules.

771
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:07.859
Nice to meet you, Jules.

772
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.359
I'm Jeremy.

773
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.910
Nice to meet you too, Jeremy.

774
00:46:17.723 --> 00:46:19.563
I'm sorry, I didn't.

775
00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:22.447
I leaned in, you just got.

776
00:46:28.971 --> 00:46:31.804
So do you know where the room is?

777
00:46:34.102 --> 00:46:35.519
Actually, I do.

778
00:47:25.703 --> 00:47:27.953
Damn, that was something.

779
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:30.940
Yeah, it was.

780
00:47:34.238 --> 00:47:35.538
Can I tell you a secret?

781
00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.270
If you trust me enough?

782
00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:47.219
This was actually my first time.

783
00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:48.220
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


784
00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:58.893
What's wrong?

785
00:48:00.082 --> 00:48:01.619
I gotta get home.

786
00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:03.899
My mom's gonna kill me
if I come home late.


787
00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:05.759
Okay, can I take you home then?

788
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.169
No, it's all good!

789
00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:08.549
Thanks though.

790
00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:10.053
Jules, hey?

791
00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:12.569
It's dark out,

792
00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:13.649
and there's a bunch of drunk

793
00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:15.649
lunatics with fruit costumes on.

794
00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:23.333
Look, I just wanna make sure
that you make it home safe.


795
00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:27.760
Okay.

796
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:46.390
You think it's too late
to go trick or treating?


797
00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:52.409
Oh, I know this great pizza
place round the corner.


798
00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:54.419
You know, maybe I could
take you out sometime?


799
00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:55.347
We could hang out.

800
00:48:55.348 --> 00:48:58.683
Hey Jeremy, there's something
I probably should tell you.


801
00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:00.760
What is it?

802
00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:04.520
So the thing is...

803
00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.120
I'm gay,

804
00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:10.619
and I know I probably should
have told you that before,


805
00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:13.143
but I think I just figured it out.

806
00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:18.869
Was I that bad?

807
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:20.279
No, no, no, no.

808
00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.280
It wasn't you.

809
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:24.970
I'm sorry, Jeremy.

810
00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:29.253
I ruined your night and your first time.

811
00:49:30.939 --> 00:49:31.939
Stupid.

812
00:49:41.858 --> 00:49:42.858
No.

813
00:49:49.565 --> 00:49:50.732
No, it's okay.

814
00:49:52.197 --> 00:49:53.803
I'm just glad that you told me.

815
00:49:55.058 --> 00:49:56.058
Really?

816
00:49:57.068 --> 00:49:58.068
Yeah.

817
00:50:02.904 --> 00:50:06.843
I mean, not too many people
are open about how they feel,


818
00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:11.073
but I'm just glad that
you trust me with that.


819
00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:16.110
I didn't think you'd
be this understanding.


820
00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:20.265
And now you know.

821
00:50:21.842 --> 00:50:25.082
And it was good either way, so...

822
00:50:25.083 --> 00:50:27.083
Oh, you are so stupid.

823
00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:43.769
Alright everyone, keep your papers,

824
00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:45.749
but I expect your complete assignment

825
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:47.253
by the end of next week, okay?

826
00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:50.390
Alright everyone, have a good day.

827
00:51:08.916 --> 00:51:10.166
It's Jules.

828
00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:13.250

Ethan?

837
00:52:10.045 --> 00:52:11.045
Ethan?

838
00:52:22.512 --> 00:52:25.345
Why do I even know where you live?

839
00:52:35.567 --> 00:52:36.567
Jesus man.

840
00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:03.070
Come on!

841
00:53:09.653 --> 00:53:11.433
You are home, Mr Miller.

842
00:53:19.729 --> 00:53:22.079
No dad, no!

843
00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:23.480
You better thank me later.

844
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.160
Yeah, you owe me.

845
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:06.873
You know, I should be home right now,

846
00:54:08.055 --> 00:54:11.103
but here I am,
taking care of your ass.

847
00:54:29.368 --> 00:54:30.543
You're awake!

848
00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:34.470
What are you doing in my house?

849
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:38.369
What are you doing in my house?

850
00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:39.203
Listen to me...

851
00:54:39.204 --> 00:54:40.712
I asked you a question.

852
00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:42.893
What are you doing?

853
00:54:42.893 --> 00:54:43.726
I dragged your ass home because you

854
00:54:43.727 --> 00:54:45.360
was passed out in an alley, okay?

855
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:51.482
I didn't need your help, man.

856
00:54:51.483 --> 00:54:52.799
I don't need anybody's help.

857
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:53.939
Okay fine, all right?

858
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:54.959
I'll leave!

859
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:55.960
Just stop this!

860
00:55:02.805 --> 00:55:03.972
You're dead.

861
00:55:11.665 --> 00:55:12.665
You're dead

862
00:56:29.738 --> 00:56:31.488
Hey, it's okay man.

863
00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:46.800
If you're done, you can leave.

864
00:56:49.328 --> 00:56:51.569
You know, I could have
left you out there to die,


865
00:56:51.570 --> 00:56:53.849
but I didn't.

866
00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:54.959
So?

867
00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.210
Think you did me a favor?

868
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:59.250
What do you want from me, man?

869
00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:01.919
Yo, I don't know what
your beef is with me...


870
00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.843
You know what my beef is with you.

871
00:57:04.830 --> 00:57:05.939
Look man, let me just help you.

872
00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:07.443
Who have you ever helped?

873
00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:10.289
Exactly, nobody man.

874
00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:12.840
You think that seeing me
like this makes you brave?


875
00:57:14.550 --> 00:57:15.950
You're still a little bitch.

876
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:18.263
Ethan,

877
00:57:18.264 --> 00:57:20.249
you cannot keep living like this, man.

878
00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:22.029
Now the coward's gonna
teach me how to live my life?


879
00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:23.080
Is that what this is?

880
00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:25.330
Get out, man.

881
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:27.190
Leave!

882
00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:33.580
Fine.

883
00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.239
You know what?

884
00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:43.173
I may be a coward, but
you're still a loser.


885
00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.080
Yo, wait.

886
00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:54.490
You're right, man.

887
00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:00.670
I'm a loser.

888
00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.400
I need help.

889
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:07.620
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you,

890
00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:08.453
'cause sometimes it gets like loud...

891
00:58:08.454 --> 00:58:09.599
I said I need help,

892
00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.600
man, please.

893
00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:13.799
For the first time, Ethan,

894
00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.873
we're on the same page, man.

895
00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:21.385
So how are you gonna help me, man?

896
00:58:21.386 --> 00:58:22.636
I don't know.

897
00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:25.499
I mean, I'll figure out something.

898
00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:27.140
I mean, what are
you gonna tell your dad?

899
00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.050
I'll make something up.

900
00:58:32.505 --> 00:58:33.959
Why don't you go pack some clothes,

901
00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:34.793
we'll go to my house.

902
00:58:34.793 --> 00:58:35.626
Your house?

903
00:58:35.626 --> 00:58:36.459
No, no, no man.

904
00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:37.923
I can't go to your house.

905
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:41.519
Fine, goodnight.

906
00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.770
Alright, wait a minute.

907
00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:47.350
Alright.

908
00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:51.183
And pack a toothbrush.

Yeah, yeah.

925
01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.172
Yep, that's right baby!

926
01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:21.749
Give me a sexier look.

927
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:22.740
Sexier.

928
01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:23.573
Look a little to the right.

929
01:00:23.574 --> 01:00:25.409
Hold that right there.

930
01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:26.819
Ooh, that's perfect.

931
01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:27.959
Don't move.

932
01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:30.209
Ooh, hold that.

933
01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.500
There it is.

934
01:00:31.501 --> 01:00:32.501
Yes.

935
01:00:34.014 --> 01:00:36.873
I think that we
are done for today, Maya.

936
01:00:40.543 --> 01:00:42.914
Excuse me.

937
01:00:42.915 --> 01:00:45.939
Damn, you must be the new girl?

938
01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:48.149
Yes, I'm Tiffany.

939
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:49.251
Hi Tiffany.

940
01:00:49.252 --> 01:00:50.085
Hi.

941
01:00:50.086 --> 01:00:51.333
It is nice to meet you.

942
01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.479
God, you are gorgeous.

943
01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.313
Thank you.

944
01:00:55.314 --> 01:00:56.669
Are you ready for the shoot?

945
01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:57.813
- Yeah.
- Awesome.


946
01:00:58.710 --> 01:01:00.509
Let's go in the room in
the back and get changed.


947
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:01.559
The outfits are waiting for you, okay?

948
01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.843
Okay, thanks.

949
01:01:07.350 --> 01:01:08.350
Not bad.

950
01:01:40.695 --> 01:01:41.695
Um...

951
01:01:54.903 --> 01:01:55.903
Oh my God.

952
01:01:58.075 --> 01:01:59.075
Thanks.

953
01:02:03.802 --> 01:02:05.036
Um, sir?

954
01:02:05.037 --> 01:02:06.393
Are you ready, Tiffany?

955
01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.153
I need you to be natural.

956
01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.213
Be sexy, okay?

957
01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:17.279
It's just that I'm a little
uncomfortable in this outfit.


958
01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.529
And I was wondering if maybe you could

959
01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:21.080
give me something else to wear?

960
01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:29.783
Listen, girl.

961
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:33.929
There's absolutely nothing
to worry about, okay?


962
01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:35.879
I'm the best at what I do.

963
01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:38.580
Most people are shy at first,
but they get used to it.


964
01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:44.523
Trust me, okay?

965
01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:48.790
Okay.

966
01:02:56.208 --> 01:02:57.208
Rachel?

967
01:03:01.116 --> 01:03:02.116
Rachel!

968
01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:04.379
Hi.

969
01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.899
Will you please adjust her outfit

970
01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.403
just the way that I like it?

971
01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.663
You shouldn't have come here.

972
01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:24.843
Thank you, thank you.

973
01:03:33.177 --> 01:03:35.793
You still seem a little nervous.

974
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:40.583
Why don't I help you relax a bit?

975
01:03:50.541 --> 01:03:51.541
Ethan?

976
01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:55.660
I got you some food.

977
01:03:59.497 --> 01:04:01.593
I don't want food, man.

978
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:05.369
Yeah, but if you don't eat,

979
01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:06.270
you will...

980
01:04:06.271 --> 01:04:08.429
I need drugs, man.

981
01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:09.503
I need drugs.

982
01:04:19.964 --> 01:04:21.551
Ethan, Ethan, Ethan.

983
01:04:21.552 --> 01:04:22.552
Hey, Ethan?

984
01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:04.770
Hey.

985
01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:05.770
Hey.

986
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.100
What happened to me?

987
01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:13.970
You were really messed up.

988
01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.080
How'd you stop me?

989
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.333
I didn't, I just left you.

990
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:25.233
I had no idea
what to actually do, so.

991
01:05:26.070 --> 01:05:27.070
Obviously.

992
01:05:28.323 --> 01:05:29.613
Man, I won't lie.

993
01:05:30.450 --> 01:05:31.450
I got scared.

994
01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:33.170
Yeah, yeah.

995
01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:36.948
I'm sorry man.

996
01:05:36.949 --> 01:05:39.303
Nah, it's okay.

997
01:05:40.410 --> 01:05:42.809
I know how hard
it must be for you,

998
01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:44.823
but trust me, you're doing better.

999
01:05:48.270 --> 01:05:49.270
You hungry?

1000
01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:51.880
A little, yeah.

1001
01:05:53.490 --> 01:05:56.867
I got some leftover
spaghetti that my mom cooked.


1002
01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:21.353
Jules?

1003
01:06:21.354 --> 01:06:22.713
Hey Alex, what's up?

1004
01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:33.389
My cousin's here, so I
was hanging out with her.


1005
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:34.859
What are you doing here?

1006
01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:39.779
Oh, I just thought maybe
you and I could go out.


1007
01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:41.793
I'm so sorry, but I can't.

1008
01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:45.420
You know what, it's okay.

1009
01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:47.650
Are you sure?

1010
01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:51.033
Yeah, I should have called you before.

1011
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:53.849
Oh, these are for you by the way.

1012
01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:54.900
I hope you like them.

1013
01:06:57.150 --> 01:07:00.269
I'm sorry Jules, but whatever this is,

1014
01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:02.159
I can't accept it.

1015
01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.479
I know you came here to hang out,

1016
01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:06.993
but I already love someone.

1017
01:07:07.950 --> 01:07:11.073
I'm sorry, but I just
can't accept this from you.


1018
01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:15.809
But I think of you as
a really good friend,


1019
01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:18.633
so hopefully we can
continue with that, hmm?


1020
01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.400
Okay.

1021
01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:26.639
Yeah, sorry to distribute you.

1022
01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:27.640
Goodnight, Alexis.

1023
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.149
Gosh, why am I being so open?

1024
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:07.653
Is it the beer?

1025
01:08:07.654 --> 01:08:10.499
Nah, I don't think it's the beer.

1026
01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:14.939
I mean, we're friends.

1027
01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:17.849
I just think you trust
me enough to talk to me.


1028
01:08:17.850 --> 01:08:19.713
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1029
01:08:21.690 --> 01:08:23.973
So your story?

1030
01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.560
Yeah.

1031
01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:32.300
So it was about a year ago and
I was taking piano lessons.


1032
01:08:34.170 --> 01:08:35.519
There were a lot of other kids there,

1033
01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.620
but I was the only
one with an extra hour.

1034
01:08:39.330 --> 01:08:42.119
The dude taught me many tricks

1035
01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:43.923
and tips to help me learn the piano.

1036
01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:48.880
Then one day,

1037
01:08:51.238 --> 01:08:52.821
he just touched me.

1038
01:08:56.413 --> 01:08:59.363
I regret I didn't tell my
parents what happened after that.


1039
01:09:03.108 --> 01:09:06.047
I just hate myself so much right now.

1040
01:09:06.930 --> 01:09:09.530
If only I'd had the guts
to tell this to my parents.


1041
01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:12.660
What are you waiting for?

1042
01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:16.140
They deserve to know more than I do.

1043
01:09:17.017 --> 01:09:19.349
But I'm scared, Jeremy.

1044
01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:20.669
I'm scared that they'll abandon me

1045
01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:22.643
because I'm not the
girl they thought I was.


1046
01:09:24.884 --> 01:09:27.719
You gotta give them a chance, Jules.

1047
01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:28.720
I mean, at least.

1048
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:31.380
Sure, they'll be mad,

1049
01:09:31.381 --> 01:09:32.883
but not because of you.

1050
01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.080
You think so?

1051
01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:39.269
You think I should tell
my parents what happened?


1052
01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:40.270
Yeah.

1053
01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.120
Trust me.

1054
01:09:43.830 --> 01:09:44.830
You'll feel better,

1055
01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:46.949
and what's the worst
thing they're gonna do?


1056
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:48.317
Throw pie in your face?

1057
01:09:48.318 --> 01:09:53.318
Oh, you're so stupid!

1058
01:09:53.757 --> 01:09:55.376
But thanks, Jeremy.

1059
01:09:55.377 --> 01:09:56.377
Ah, no problem.

1060
01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:59.843
I'm just glad you're
taking a wise man's advice.


1061
01:10:00.810 --> 01:10:02.699
Okay, now this is unfair.

1062
01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:04.409
Now I feel like you have
something to blackmail me with,


1063
01:10:04.410 --> 01:10:05.759
and I still don't have anything on you.

1064
01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.734
Well let's keep it that way, shall we?

1065
01:10:07.735 --> 01:10:08.819
Oh hell no!

1066
01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:11.189
I opened up to you, it's
only right you do the same.


1067
01:10:11.190 --> 01:10:13.019
When did this ever become a rule?

1068
01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:16.023
Since tonight, and since
that time you kissed me.


1069
01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:19.900
Fair enough.

1070
01:10:21.090 --> 01:10:22.090
Well, what is it?

1071
01:10:24.211 --> 01:10:26.183
I just feel like
you're gonna laugh, but,


1072
01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:29.633
you know you were the first
girl I ever flirted with?


1073
01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.699
Wait, what?

1074
01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:34.550
Wait, are you being freaking serious?

1075
01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:36.898
Huh.

1076
01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:38.999
I thought you were like a literal Playboy.

1077
01:10:41.010 --> 01:10:42.599
Really?

1078
01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:44.399
Were my lines that good?

1079
01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:45.400
Not really.

1080
01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:49.289
You just seem like a natural.

1081
01:10:49.290 --> 01:10:50.290
Thanks.

1082
01:10:51.690 --> 01:10:53.873
If only you didn't tell
me that you were gay,


1083
01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:58.413
I'd kiss you again.

1084
01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:07.323
You know, I think this
makes us friends officially.


1085
01:11:08.250 --> 01:11:11.219
Boy, we were friends in
the moment we saw each other.


1086
01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:13.019
Oh, I like that.

1087
01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:13.950
Okay, do you think we should get

1088
01:11:13.951 --> 01:11:15.573
that on t-shirts and sell them?

1089
01:11:16.527 --> 01:11:18.610
Not a bad idea, friend.

1090
01:11:24.597 --> 01:11:25.997
You think we should leave?

1091
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:29.700
No, I don't really want to go yet.

1092
01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:34.849
Thanks Jeremy.

1093
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:35.850
Yeah, no problem.

1094
01:12:24.834 --> 01:12:26.964
This is real drug, man.

1095
01:12:26.965 --> 01:12:28.427
For real.

1096
01:12:28.428 --> 01:12:31.845
Yeah, everybody loves my mom's cooking.

1097
01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.559
Where are your parents?

1098
01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.560
In Vegas.

1099
01:12:38.909 --> 01:12:40.159
You should, um,

1100
01:12:42.717 --> 01:12:44.939
let your parents know you're here.

1101
01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:46.983
I mean, they may be worried.

1102
01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:54.230
My dad doesn't care about me.

1103
01:12:55.993 --> 01:12:57.483
What about your mom?

1104
01:12:58.410 --> 01:13:02.129
She, uh.

1105
01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:03.430
She died a few years back.

1106
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:10.990
I'm sorry, man.

1107
01:13:18.510 --> 01:13:21.770
Ever since then, my
dad hasn't been the same.


1108
01:13:23.864 --> 01:13:25.864
I haven't been the same.

1109
01:13:31.219 --> 01:13:33.469
But dad literally hates me.

1110
01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:37.263
I don't think he does.

1111
01:13:40.325 --> 01:13:42.274
He may just have a weird
way of showing he loves you,


1112
01:13:42.275 --> 01:13:45.551
but I don't think he hates you.

1113
01:13:45.552 --> 01:13:46.552
Yeah, he does.

1114
01:13:47.744 --> 01:13:48.744
Trust me.

1115
01:13:51.618 --> 01:13:52.868
You know why I hated you?

1116
01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:57.659
Ever since my mom died,
Tiffany and I got really close.


1117
01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:59.810
Her dad left her mom
around the same times.


1118
01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.263
We became each other's
shoulder than lean on.


1119
01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.333
That's why I hated you,
'cause I blamed you.


1120
01:14:09.450 --> 01:14:12.383
I blamed you for taking away
the only reason I had to live.


1121
01:14:14.787 --> 01:14:16.053
I'm sorry, man.

1122
01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.160
I didn't know.

1123
01:14:19.171 --> 01:14:21.419
It's over, you know?

1124
01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:22.470
I gotta deal with it.

1125
01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:27.299
It's funny how life works,

1126
01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:29.550
'cause now you're the only
one that's willing to help me.


1127
01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.650
Yeah, I know,

1128
01:14:35.283 --> 01:14:37.483
and you're the reason
why Tiffany dumped me.


1129
01:14:39.570 --> 01:14:40.570
For real?

1130
01:14:42.210 --> 01:14:43.210
I guess we're even.

1131
01:14:44.028 --> 01:14:44.880
Yeah, we're even.

1132
01:14:44.881 --> 01:14:46.289
Good riddance to us.

1133
01:14:46.290 --> 01:14:47.669
God, when she got mad?

1134
01:14:47.670 --> 01:14:49.409
She's gnarly...

1135
01:14:49.410 --> 01:14:51.809
Yeah she blew up, man.

1136
01:14:51.810 --> 01:14:52.919
Should have seen her.

1137
01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:53.960
Jeremy!

1138
01:14:53.961 --> 01:14:56.433
Get up here and stand up for me!

1139
01:15:06.886 --> 01:15:08.219
Wait, wait, wait.

1140
01:15:10.052 --> 01:15:11.609
Shortcut, shortcut.

1141
01:15:11.610 --> 01:15:12.610
Get knowledge.

1142
01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:16.853
Who's that?

1143
01:15:16.854 --> 01:15:18.458
I don't know, go answer it.

1144
01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:22.200
Oh, you better not
let Wave Chappelle win.


1145
01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:28.690
Where the hell's my son?

1146
01:15:30.088 --> 01:15:33.255
Ethan, Ethan?

1147
01:15:34.457 --> 01:15:35.457
Ethan!

1148
01:15:36.486 --> 01:15:38.489
Where's my son?

1149
01:15:38.490 --> 01:15:39.450
Ethan isn't here.

1150
01:15:39.451 --> 01:15:40.459
Tell me where my son is right now,

1151
01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:42.809
or I will call the cops and
put you behind bars so quick.


1152
01:15:42.810 --> 01:15:44.720
You have no idea the connections I have.

1153
01:15:44.721 --> 01:15:45.554
Ethan?

1154
01:15:45.554 --> 01:15:46.387
With all due respect, sir,

1155
01:15:46.388 --> 01:15:48.216
Ethan isn't here, I
don't know where he is...


1156
01:15:48.217 --> 01:15:50.369
Don't lie to me, kid.

1157
01:15:50.370 --> 01:15:53.069
My neighbor saw you with
him a couple of days ago.


1158
01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:55.229
You tell me where he's at right now.

1159
01:15:55.230 --> 01:15:56.995
Enough of this camp bullshit.

1160
01:15:56.996 --> 01:15:58.109
Ethan?

1161
01:15:58.110 --> 01:15:59.110
Dad.

1162
01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:03.093
Ethan, when did you get here?

1163
01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.720
What are you doing here?

1164
01:16:11.721 --> 01:16:14.189
What am I doing here?

1165
01:16:14.190 --> 01:16:16.349
The question is what are
you doing here, Ethan?


1166
01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:19.889
I came to hang with my
friend Jeremy for a few days.


1167
01:16:19.890 --> 01:16:21.569
Seriously, him?

1168
01:16:21.570 --> 01:16:22.773
Yeah dad, my friend.

1169
01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:25.889
Okay guys, look.

1170
01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:27.749
Let's take it slow and steady.

1171
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:28.583
Mr Miller...

1172
01:16:28.583 --> 01:16:29.416
Get out of here.

1173
01:16:29.417 --> 01:16:31.649
What the hell, relax!

1174
01:16:31.650 --> 01:16:33.389
This is enough, Ethan.

1175
01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:34.740
We're going home right now.

1176
01:16:36.394 --> 01:16:37.494
I'm not coming home.

1177
01:16:39.630 --> 01:16:41.039
What did you say to me?

1178
01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.749
Okay, look, look.

1179
01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:44.899
Come on, we can just talk about this.

1180
01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:45.863
What did I tell you...

1181
01:16:45.863 --> 01:16:46.863
Dad, stop!

1182
01:16:49.895 --> 01:16:50.895
You alright?

1183
01:16:53.533 --> 01:16:54.569
Mr Miller.

1184
01:16:54.570 --> 01:16:56.849
Your son is a good kid, alright?

1185
01:16:56.850 --> 01:16:58.250
He deserves better than you.

1186
01:16:59.893 --> 01:17:02.143
Enough, we're going home.

1187
01:17:03.610 --> 01:17:06.513
No dad, I'm not coming home with you.

1188
01:17:07.472 --> 01:17:08.472
What did you say?

1189
01:17:09.447 --> 01:17:11.403
I'm tired of living under your abuse.

1190
01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:15.449
What did you do to my son?

1191
01:17:15.450 --> 01:17:17.489
Dad, I'm done living my life

1192
01:17:17.490 --> 01:17:19.649
like an addict who's got
nothing better to do.


1193
01:17:19.650 --> 01:17:21.550
And Jeremy's done nothing but help me.

1194
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:26.669
You think you're better than me?

1195
01:17:26.670 --> 01:17:28.519
But you know what?

1196
01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:31.046
You're the biggest
disappointment in my life.


1197
01:17:31.047 --> 01:17:31.880
Oh yeah?

1198
01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:32.880
Well, I come from you.

1199
01:17:35.854 --> 01:17:38.297
One more word and you're dead.

1200
01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:42.108
You think I'm afraid of you?

1201
01:17:42.109 --> 01:17:43.616
I'm not scared of you anymore, dad.

1202
01:17:43.617 --> 01:17:45.533
You can't control me, you
can't even control yourself.


1203
01:17:45.534 --> 01:17:46.534
Look at you.

1204
01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:49.059
Mr Miller!

1205
01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:53.553
Mr Miller, stop!

1206
01:17:54.814 --> 01:17:57.112
Get off me, get off me!

1207
01:18:03.371 --> 01:18:04.621
Son of a bitch.

1208
01:18:06.296 --> 01:18:07.296
Stop!

1209
01:18:15.996 --> 01:18:17.579
Alright, come on.

1210
01:18:25.998 --> 01:18:26.998
Hey, wait.

1211
01:18:28.182 --> 01:18:30.015
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

1212
01:18:36.281 --> 01:18:37.531
Oh no, oh no.

1213
01:18:53.197 --> 01:18:55.113
I'm gonna go get some rest.

1214
01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:57.520
I suggest you do the same.

1215
01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:08.140
Oh, hey.

1216
01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:10.110
Call the cops for me?

1217
01:19:11.921 --> 01:19:12.971
And an ambulance too?

1218
01:19:16.047 --> 01:19:18.210
What are you gonna tell the cops?

1219
01:19:20.010 --> 01:19:21.010
Self defense.

1220
01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:29.163
Sometimes you gotta stand up and fight.

1221
01:19:31.710 --> 01:19:33.629
You gotta face your fears,

1222
01:19:33.630 --> 01:19:35.669
and tell it that you're done worrying,

1223
01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:37.557
you're done hiding,

1224
01:19:37.558 --> 01:19:41.013
and show the world who you
really are behind that fear.


1225
01:19:43.170 --> 01:19:44.673
And once you do that?

1226
01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:48.513
The world becomes,

1227
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:51.123
it becomes much more different.

1228
01:19:53.432 --> 01:19:54.723
And it becomes livable,

1229
01:19:56.190 --> 01:19:58.394
enjoyable, and you can,

1230
01:19:58.395 --> 01:20:00.363
you can just breathe.

1231
01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.409
Now, this is nothing that I'm just

1232
01:20:04.410 --> 01:20:09.025
speaking randomly or anything like that.

1233
01:20:09.026 --> 01:20:10.859
It's just, I lived it,

1234
01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:13.743
and I realized that fear?

1235
01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.017
It's nothing that to be afraid of.

1236
01:20:28.279 --> 01:20:30.622
And arms
lengthening down by your side.


1237
01:20:30.623 --> 01:20:31.562
On breath in, reach your arms...

1238
01:20:31.563 --> 01:20:32.634
Hey, mom?

1239
01:20:32.635 --> 01:20:34.833
Hey, sweetheart.

1240
01:20:34.834 --> 01:20:36.485
Can we talk?

1241
01:20:45.091 --> 01:20:46.091
You okay?

1242
01:21:15.930 --> 01:21:17.230
Ethan!

1243
01:21:17.231 --> 01:21:18.779
Do I have to do this?

1244
01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:19.889
Yes.

1245
01:21:19.890 --> 01:21:21.696
Trust me, this is better
than DIY treatment.


1246
01:21:21.697 --> 01:21:23.009
Yeah, but I'm clean.

1247
01:21:23.010 --> 01:21:24.149
I'm good.

1248
01:21:24.150 --> 01:21:25.379
Ethan, if you really wanna get better,

1249
01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:28.173
this is the right way and
only choice that you have.


1250
01:21:31.988 --> 01:21:33.963
Alright, alright.

1251
01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:39.779
Hi, how can I help you?

1252
01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:42.997
Hey, my friend here wants to get clean,

1253
01:21:45.553 --> 01:21:47.459
so can you tell us about the programs

1254
01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:48.360
that you guys have please?

1255
01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.193
Of course!

1256
01:21:49.194 --> 01:21:50.789
Follow me and I'll take
you to the counselor.


1257
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:53.129
He'll help you decide which
programs are best for you.


1258
01:21:53.130 --> 01:21:54.120
Right this way.

1259
01:21:54.121 --> 01:21:55.443
Alright, let's go.

1260
01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.280
One.

1261
01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:07.973
Two.

1262
01:22:07.974 --> 01:22:09.149
Man, shut up.

1263
01:22:09.150 --> 01:22:11.287
You're worse than my pops.

1264
01:22:21.295 --> 01:22:22.295
Tiff?

1265
01:22:25.138 --> 01:22:27.719
What are you doing here?

1266
01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:29.879
I just came to apologize,

1267
01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:32.830
because I know that I was harsh
and I know that I hurt you.


1268
01:22:33.893 --> 01:22:37.949
Can you please accept my apology?

1269
01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:40.649
What's going on, is everything okay?

1270
01:22:40.650 --> 01:22:43.083
No, nothing's right.

1271
01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:45.730
Everything's kind of falling apart.

1272
01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:53.120
Wanna go for a walk in the park?

1273
01:22:54.651 --> 01:22:59.651
Yeah.

1274
01:23:10.648 --> 01:23:14.427
Please say something.

1275
01:23:14.428 --> 01:23:18.888
What do you want me to say, Tiff?

1276
01:23:18.889 --> 01:23:21.321
Look, I'm sorry about
what happened to you,


1277
01:23:21.322 --> 01:23:23.643
but why are you telling me this?

1278
01:23:23.644 --> 01:23:26.249
Because there's nobody I can talk to.

1279
01:23:26.250 --> 01:23:28.679
Tiffany, everyone loves you!

1280
01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:30.416
I'm pretty sure you can,

1281
01:23:30.417 --> 01:23:32.024
you got plenty of friends to talk to...

1282
01:23:32.025 --> 01:23:33.975
Yeah, but there's nobody I can trust.

1283
01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:36.419
Tiff.

1284
01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:38.219
Look, I know I acted selfishly,

1285
01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:40.169
but can you please just
give me another chance?


1286
01:23:40.170 --> 01:23:41.160
I promise that.

1287
01:23:41.161 --> 01:23:42.346
No Tiff, stop.

1288
01:23:42.347 --> 01:23:43.180
I promise that I won't...

1289
01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:44.180
Stop!

1290
01:23:51.146 --> 01:23:52.843
Look, the thing is,

1291
01:23:56.010 --> 01:23:57.760
even if I wanted to date you again,

1292
01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.284
I don't think that we should.

1293
01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:01.919
Why?

1294
01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:02.939
Because.

1295
01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:04.349
Because you already love somebody else?

1296
01:24:04.350 --> 01:24:05.909
No, it's nothing like that.

1297
01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:09.843
It's just I think that we just
end up hurting each other.


1298
01:24:11.519 --> 01:24:12.689
Look, I promise.

1299
01:24:12.690 --> 01:24:14.429
I promise I will never hurt you again.

1300
01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:16.233
Tiffany, you can't promise that.

1301
01:24:27.119 --> 01:24:28.229
Look.

1302
01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:29.063
Look at me, Tiffany.

1303
01:24:29.063 --> 01:24:30.063
No.

1304
01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:41.223
If you ever need me, you know
I'll always be there for you.


1305
01:24:43.789 --> 01:24:46.279
Alright, but I think you should just

1306
01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:48.057
go and tell your mom about what happened.

Boo!

1326
01:25:45.142 --> 01:25:47.142
So how have things been?

1327
01:25:49.212 --> 01:25:51.479
Hey, why do I feel like it's been

1328
01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.489
a long time since we last talked?

1329
01:25:53.490 --> 01:25:54.940
Because it has been, silly.

1330
01:25:57.420 --> 01:25:58.910
Jules, I'm sorry.

1331
01:26:01.176 --> 01:26:02.176
You forgive me?

1332
01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:05.590
Never.

1333
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:11.249
Okay, what is up with
you and Ethan by the way?


1334
01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:13.409
People are saying you beat up his dad.

1335
01:26:13.410 --> 01:26:16.079
Ethan's actually a good guy.

1336
01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:19.713
I've been helping him out
with a few of his issues.


1337
01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:25.683
You know what'd be so good right now?

1338
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:28.230
What?

1339
01:26:28.231 --> 01:26:31.349
Well, there's this pizza
place not too far from my house.


1340
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:33.123
Maybe you and I should go sometime.

1341
01:26:35.010 --> 01:26:36.719
Like tonight?

1342
01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:37.553
Well, if we rush,

1343
01:26:37.554 --> 01:26:38.939
we can get there before they close.

1344
01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:40.533
Seriously?

1345
01:26:43.710 --> 01:26:45.393
Are you sure, Jules?

1346
01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:47.939
Jeez, Jeremy,

1347
01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:49.263
you are terrible at this.

1348
01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:54.570
Let's go before they actually close.

1349
01:26:58.433 --> 01:27:01.499
You know, I knew you was
gonna come around eventually.


1350
01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:02.448
Yeah, me too.

1351
01:27:02.449 --> 01:27:04.619
I don't know what it was though.

1352
01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:05.879
It was my swag!

1353
01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:07.289
Jeremy got a lot of it.

1354
01:27:07.290 --> 01:27:08.123
No, no, no, no.

1355
01:27:08.123 --> 01:27:08.961
That's not it.

1356
01:27:08.962 --> 01:27:11.198
I think it was the um

1357
01:27:11.199 --> 01:27:12.272
That avocado costume

1358
01:27:12.273 --> 01:27:14.926
