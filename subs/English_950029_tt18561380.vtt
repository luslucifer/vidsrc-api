1
00:00:29.208 --> 00:00:31.608
I couldn't find the parts
regarding my share of the building.


2
00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:45.749
“This agreement concerns the
two and a half floor building at block”


3
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.208
Look, two and a half floor.
That’s your house…


4
00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:56.208
There. "The ownership of
the building is to be shared


5
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:02.583
so that 40% will be turned
over to the property owner.


6
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:07.291
You get five apartments in the new
building. You know, as we agreed earlier.


7
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.500
Any questions? Don’t hesitate to ask me.
I don’t want you


8
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.130
to be left with any questions
in your mind, you see.


9
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.750
How many apartments do you get?

10
00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:23.457
Six. But that includes Okan’s share.
Okan is a dear friend to me…


11
00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:25.449
What do you mean, six?
You mean one half of the


12
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.666
building will have five
apartments, and the other six?


13
00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:29.708
No, of course not.

14
00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:33.625
I was assuming the top floor
as a single apartment.


15
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:37.166
You know, I will join the two
apartments that are my share...


16
00:01:39.916 --> 00:01:42.625
How many does Okan get?

17
00:01:43.708 --> 00:01:47.165
That's written in the
agreement already.


18
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:50.583
About everything else,
you don't have to worry.


19
00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:53.875
We'll finish this as soon as
possible, God willing.


20
00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:58.791
And this will really make sure you're
comfortably off, both Okan and you. Okay?


21
00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:01.040
Comfortable...

22
00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:08.207
Of course it will. Look at this
house, Miss Müjde.


23
00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:12.832
How will you take care of this
house all on your own


24
00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:15.750
after this age, with nobody to help?

25
00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:20.124
See, this house isn’t livable anyway...

26
00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:21.625
Mind your words.

27
00:02:22.416 --> 00:02:25.166
No, no, I don't mean any disrespect.

28
00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:29.290
You told me only recently
that the house has constantly


29
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:32.625
been causing you expenses...
I was just being candid.


30
00:02:32.666 --> 00:02:37.540
No, you’re being disrespectful. I’ve lived
in this house for 40 years. I was raised


31
00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:41.000
in this house. So was Okan. I’m not your
friend just because you know my son!


32
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.832
Why are you getting
angry for no reason?


33
00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:45.913
Miss Müjde, I was just telling
you what I was seeing.


34
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:50.541
Let me tell you what you’re seeing:
Types like you see nothing but money.


35
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.750
Please don’t say that. I’m not a man
to care about worldly possessions.


36
00:02:57.791 --> 00:02:59.551
Oh, so you erect those
skyscrapers for Allah?


37
00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:11.415
Miss Müjde, I don’t care about money.
All I want is to get your good prayers.


38
00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:15.957
Our prophet has said, “I take pride
in the wealth of my ummah."


39
00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.415
We have to work today,
so that we can leave behind


40
00:03:19.416 --> 00:03:24.124
a beautiful homeland for our children
tomorrow, both mine and yours.


41
00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:26.333
Right? It’s all for them.

42
00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:29.208
There’s a store on the
ground floor in the project.


43
00:03:31.708 --> 00:03:37.291
You're quick-witted.
You don't miss anything, maşallah.


44
00:03:41.791 --> 00:03:43.333
Aleyküm Selam brother.

45
00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:46.673
That's not a store.
Something like a storeroom.


46
00:03:47.375 --> 00:03:49.833
No I wasn't talk to
you. How are you? Yes.

47
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.500
No, man, it’s way too early for that!
I don’t do that in business hours!


48
00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:28.957
My country, the people of my country
matter to me above all.


49
00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:33.665
By allowing three and a half million
unqualified Syrians into the country,


50
00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:36.415
they've already diminished the gross
national product by three percent.


51
00:04:36.416 --> 00:04:38.915
- But what do you mean by
"unqualified" here?


52
00:04:38.916 --> 00:04:41.881
These people are
unqualified, that's one thing.


53
00:04:41.905 --> 00:04:45.583
And, did these people leave
their countries? They did...


54
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.083
Hello, mom. How are you?

55
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.749
Okan? Why are you calling at this hour?

56
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.207
I just wanted to hear your voice.
And I thought I’d congratulate you.


57
00:05:14.208 --> 00:05:15.290
For what?

58
00:05:15.291 --> 00:05:16.958
I got the news from Berat.

59
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:25.874
I mean, do you fully trust him?

60
00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:32.165
Mom, just trust your son.
I trust him, you trust me.


61
00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:34.125
Am I stupid?

62
00:05:34.791 --> 00:05:38.166
I hope this man doesn’t turn
out to be like your ex-partner…


63
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:43.165
Don’t be silly, mom. The man is
from Isparta anyway. Had I not been


64
00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:46.832
sure of him, I wouldn’t have let
him in your house. I’m not stupid.


65
00:05:46.833 --> 00:05:48.415
What’s that got to do with anything?

66
00:05:48.416 --> 00:05:51.165
Mom, you’re reading way too much into
things.


67
00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:52.904
We’ve all come together for this

68
00:05:52.928 --> 00:05:54.665
and we’re all trying to do
something good for you.


69
00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:56.333
Can’t you see that?

70
00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:00.750
Perhaps after a certain age,
one sees things differently.


71
00:06:01.083 --> 00:06:02.083
Huh?

72
00:06:02.666 --> 00:06:03.666
I said, I’m getting old.

73
00:06:04.333 --> 00:06:07.665
Oh. Okay.
Now, about the moving, how will you


74
00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:09.791
do it? Did Berat tell
you anything about that?


75
00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:11.416
No. Will you have time?

76
00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:15.832
Mom, we talked about that.
Nazlı’s father is having


77
00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:18.541
an operation.
I need to take Nazlı to Eskişehir.


78
00:06:18.916 --> 00:06:20.332
Oh, right.

79
00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:22.624
Okay, I arranged that with Mustafa already.

80
00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:25.790
Is it the carrier?

81
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:29.447
Okay, good. But don’t pay him money.
They’ll make out an invoice.


82
00:06:30.596 --> 00:06:32.374
Give it to Engin. Or don’t,
I’ll pick it up when I come back.


83
00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:34.299
Berat has to pay for it.

84
00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:37.659
You shouldn’t spend anything
out of your own pocket.


85
00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:40.332
I know what to do with the
invoice, Okan. I’ll take


86
00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:41.749
care of it.
Don’t talk to me like I’m a child.


87
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.291
I’ll send Engin to oversee
the porters anyway.


88
00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.583
No, I don’t need Engin.
I can handle this myself.


89
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.333
Okay, we’ll talk about this later.
What will you do now?


90
00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:56.957
Go to your friends. 
I'll sleep now.

91
00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.333
Good night then.

92
00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:49.390
As Turkey, we have been hosting a total

93
00:07:49.414 --> 00:07:53.040
of four and a half million Syrian
and Iraqi refugees in our country...


94
00:07:53.041 --> 00:07:54.666
Turn left from here.

95
00:08:16.416 --> 00:08:17.875
I’m moving a house. I need help.

96
00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:21.250
Transportation.

97
00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:23.073
Oh, transportation. Okay, okay.

98
00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:27.582
200 Liras for one person, for two 400.

99
00:08:27.583 --> 00:08:29.416
Two person is not enough.
I need three.


100
00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:34.750
Do you speak English?

101
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.707
It's a two storey house.

102
00:08:38.708 --> 00:08:41.500
Two people is not enough, I need three.

103
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Do you speak English?

104
00:08:50.916 --> 00:08:51.500
Do you speak English?

105
00:08:51.875 --> 00:08:53.125
Yes, I speak English.

106
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.958
I'm moving the house. I need help.
I need three people not two.


107
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:05.958
They want 200 liras for each person.

108
00:09:06.375 --> 00:09:07.575
- Is that okay for you?
- Okay.


109
00:09:07.833 --> 00:09:09.000
- Can you come too?
- Me?


110
00:09:10.125 --> 00:09:13.875
- Do you want me too?
- Yes, I need someone who speak English...


111
00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:24.958
- You okay?
- Yes. I'm okay.


112
00:09:50.375 --> 00:09:52.000
I'll fucking kill you.

113
00:11:08.625 --> 00:11:09.625
Thank you.

114
00:11:17.791 --> 00:11:21.041
Sorry, I can take more.

115
00:11:24.458 --> 00:11:26.250
- Thank you.
- Bon appetite.


116
00:11:29.166 --> 00:11:30.208
Enough.

117
00:11:32.375 --> 00:11:33.416
Bon appetite.

118
00:11:37.416 --> 00:11:40.707
Thank you, auntie. I won’t have any.
I’ve had a late breakfast.


119
00:11:40.708 --> 00:11:41.708
Suit yourself.

120
00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:33.207
Hallaç Hüseyin St. Number 3?

121
00:12:33.208 --> 00:12:34.208
Yes?

122
00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:36.041
Auntie, I ordered it.

123
00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:40.125
- How much brother?
- 30 liras.


124
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.041
You guys finished already?

125
00:13:44.125 --> 00:13:46.666
Have you tidied up the house?

126
00:13:47.583 --> 00:13:50.423
Auntie Müjde is staying here tonight.
Open up some room for her to walk.


127
00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:54.895
Talk to me, man! 
Are you mute or what?

128
00:13:57.333 --> 00:14:01.207
I’m tired of these men.
They’re hungry, they have nowhere


129
00:14:01.208 --> 00:14:03.708
to sleep, and they’re still
doing half-assed work.


130
00:14:04.166 --> 00:14:06.206
It’s alright.
They’ve left everything nice and tidy.


131
00:14:06.458 --> 00:14:11.041
No, they’re all lazy bastards.
They can’t withstand hardship.


132
00:14:12.208 --> 00:14:14.833
See, they’ve never done any
hard work in Syria. It shows.


133
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.860
What time are you coming tomorrow?

134
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.832
They’ll be here at 8 in the morning.

135
00:14:20.833 --> 00:14:23.916
There’s not much left to do anyway.
They’ll finish early tomorrow.


136
00:14:24.916 --> 00:14:28.624
I need to go to the bank
early, so I’ll come at noon.


137
00:14:28.625 --> 00:14:32.208
Call me if you need anything.
You've my number anyway.


138
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.666
Don’t be late. If anyone is
late, I’ll deduct from his wage.


139
00:14:43.375 --> 00:14:46.041
And take a bath when you go home.
You all stink.


140
00:14:47.083 --> 00:14:48.125
Go on.

141
00:15:29.875 --> 00:15:31.625
Good morning. Welcome.

142
00:15:40.916 --> 00:15:41.916
Your other friend?

143
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.875
Ah, Sayyid. I don't know. 
I didn't see him.

144
00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:58.708
Ok. Breakfast is ready.
After that you can start from here. Ok?


145
00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:18.000
- Selamun Aleykum.
- Aleykum Selam.


146
00:16:32.166 --> 00:16:33.166
Are you okay?

147
00:16:33.208 --> 00:16:34.625
Yeah, I'm OK.

148
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.250
Are you sure?

149
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.791
Yes. Yes.
I'm sorry I've had an accident.


150
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.875
Nothing serious. I should get started.
I'm already very late.


151
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.125
Stop. Stop.

152
00:17:00.416 --> 00:17:02.083
Put it down.

153
00:17:03.333 --> 00:17:04.333
Put it down.

154
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:20.750
They finish here. You go up,
put curtains, other things in boxes. Okay?


155
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.000
- Sayyid?
- Yes, Miss Müjde?


156
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.125
Sayyid your name, right?

157
00:17:54.583 --> 00:17:55.875
Yes. Sayyid.

158
00:17:56.166 --> 00:17:57.291
It is very bad.

159
00:17:58.666 --> 00:18:00.790
No, no.

160
00:18:00.791 --> 00:18:02.083
It is very bad.

161
00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:04.166
We have to do...

162
00:18:08.583 --> 00:18:09.583
Pansuman.

163
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:11.250
Pansuman?

164
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.583
Yes. Pansuman.

165
00:18:15.375 --> 00:18:17.375
Come. Come, sit.

166
00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:21.833
I won't hurt.

167
00:18:30.833 --> 00:18:31.833
How did it happen?

168
00:18:33.333 --> 00:18:36.708
Don't worry, it is not important.
I am used to this behaviour.


169
00:18:50.875 --> 00:18:52.166
Did you go to police?

170
00:18:56.041 --> 00:18:57.041
Why?

171
00:18:57.708 --> 00:18:59.208
Don't worry.
I'm ok.


172
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.916
Do you have a family here?

173
00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:15.708
Are they in Syria?

174
00:19:20.375 --> 00:19:21.916
They're all dead.

175
00:19:27.041 --> 00:19:30.375
I am sorry Sayyid. 
I didn't know.

176
00:19:37.916 --> 00:19:40.708
I wasn’t at home when they died.

177
00:19:42.833 --> 00:19:44.833
I was working.

178
00:19:47.458 --> 00:19:49.208
Zeineb and Rauf were at home.

179
00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:52.416
Rauf is my son.

180
00:19:53.875 --> 00:19:55.500
He was seven years old.

181
00:19:57.416 --> 00:19:59.416
Our house was bombed by Russian planes.

182
00:20:01.541 --> 00:20:04.083
I found Zeineb two hours later.

183
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.000
She was dead.

184
00:20:12.333 --> 00:20:13.541
And your son?

185
00:20:19.833 --> 00:20:21.541
We searched for two days non stop.

186
00:20:24.458 --> 00:20:26.041
I couldn't save him.

187
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:33.083
I am sorry Sayyid.
I don't know what to say.


188
00:20:39.166 --> 00:20:40.708
I didn't want to leave my country.

189
00:20:42.583 --> 00:20:44.708
I don't know why this war started.

190
00:21:03.166 --> 00:21:04.916
You're very young Sayyid.

191
00:21:07.083 --> 00:21:09.333
There's a whole life in front of you.

192
00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:12.291
You're a good person.

193
00:21:18.875 --> 00:21:21.041
No. I'm not a good person.

194
00:21:29.458 --> 00:21:31.125
But you are a very good person.

195
00:21:34.291 --> 00:21:39.583
My friends say I'm very... stubborn.

196
00:21:41.041 --> 00:21:42.041
Stubborn?

197
00:21:43.791 --> 00:21:44.791
Yes.

198
00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:48.000
We always fight.

199
00:21:59.541 --> 00:22:01.250
Stubborn, but a very good person.

200
00:22:05.833 --> 00:22:10.750
I'm sorry. My hands are heavy.
I'm getting old.


201
00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.625
No. Your hands are soft.

202
00:22:24.875 --> 00:22:27.666
The downstairs is done, 
Auntie Müjde.

203
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:29.833
I thought I’d let you know.

204
00:22:31.166 --> 00:22:32.458
Ok. This room is done.

205
00:22:38.958 --> 00:22:40.416
Sayyid.

206
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.625
Antibiotic.

207
00:22:49.083 --> 00:22:51.208
You must take antibiotic.

208
00:23:13.208 --> 00:23:15.333
I have no appetite,
but they're very delicious.


209
00:23:17.083 --> 00:23:20.041
I can't sleep nights,
it affects my appetite.


210
00:23:24.041 --> 00:23:26.500
Finally. I thought you’d never bring it.

211
00:23:27.791 --> 00:23:29.791
Şermin, you start complaining again.

212
00:23:30.458 --> 00:23:33.708
What did I say? If it was up to you,
we'll wait another hour.


213
00:23:35.625 --> 00:23:36.890
Don't you eat something, Müjde?

214
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.040
No, I won’t have anything.

215
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:39.310
Are you on a diet?

216
00:23:39.541 --> 00:23:43.467
- Not a diet, but I...
- If you’re dieting, I wonder what we should do!


217
00:23:43.491 --> 00:23:44.791
Look at our bellies!

218
00:23:45.583 --> 00:23:47.083
Oh, where did you take these photos?

219
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.500
- Let me look at it.

220
00:23:49.958 --> 00:23:50.958
Good heavens!

221
00:23:52.291 --> 00:23:53.931
Look at her coquetry! 
Like a 20 year old!

222
00:23:55.083 --> 00:23:58.101
Yasemin should get you
an Instagram account.


223
00:23:58.125 --> 00:24:00.791
Mother and daughter,
you’re both hot.


224
00:24:01.958 --> 00:24:05.000
She should get me an account if I can
message Cenk on Survivor from there!


225
00:24:07.458 --> 00:24:10.333
Don’t let her father hear that…
My daughter loves Erdem.


226
00:24:12.875 --> 00:24:16.333
No honey, we’ve gotten old now.

227
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
We can only watch those men
on TV after this age.


228
00:24:21.875 --> 00:24:24.625
Why'd you say that?
What’s wrong with your age?


229
00:24:24.958 --> 00:24:26.958
What can I say?

230
00:24:27.291 --> 00:24:30.082
We’ve lived the good life back
in our time when we were young girls.


231
00:24:30.083 --> 00:24:33.415
Come on, what good life did you live
when you were a young girl?


232
00:24:33.416 --> 00:24:35.333
You mean there were men
at the sewing course?


233
00:24:38.375 --> 00:24:44.708
Of course there were. Not in the
sewing course, but in the neighborhood.


234
00:24:46.083 --> 00:24:47.918
So Müjde, it’s been
nearly 3 months


235
00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:51.582
and you still didn’t invite us to
your new apartment.


236
00:24:51.583 --> 00:24:53.290
How is it? Are
you getting used to it?

237
00:24:53.291 --> 00:24:57.500
Sorry, I’ve taken a long time
moving in and getting settled.


238
00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:00.208
What a moving, it's not finished yet!
I'm very curious.


239
00:25:02.166 --> 00:25:06.041
Was the moving hard?
Okan must have helped you.


240
00:25:06.666 --> 00:25:11.791
No, Okan has been very busy.
I hired a few porters.


241
00:25:12.333 --> 00:25:16.166
Müjde, I was going to ask you but I forgot:
Where did you hire the porters?


242
00:25:18.791 --> 00:25:24.166
There’s a labor market under the overpass.
A few workers from there helped me.


243
00:25:24.666 --> 00:25:26.146
Oh, isn’t that place full of Syrians?

244
00:25:27.916 --> 00:25:29.915
Yes, the ones I hired were Syrians too.

245
00:25:29.916 --> 00:25:33.416
- Oh, don't.
- Are you kidding?


246
00:25:35.166 --> 00:25:38.184
I admire your courage. How come you can
just let a bunch of Syrians into your house?


247
00:25:38.208 --> 00:25:40.833
They could be burglars,
rapists, anything.


248
00:25:41.291 --> 00:25:43.165
Why? Turkish or Syrian,
what difference does it make?


249
00:25:43.166 --> 00:25:44.375
It makes a lot of difference.

250
00:25:45.041 --> 00:25:48.241
I don’t know. I see them around the field
near the street market sometimes. I see


251
00:25:48.375 --> 00:25:56.375
them come and go. With beards, turbans
and burqas and all. And they smell bad.


252
00:25:57.291 --> 00:26:01.958
I heard it on a TV debate the other day. Most
of the ones coming to Turkey are criminals.


253
00:26:02.333 --> 00:26:05.916
Assad opened the gates of all the prisons
and sent all the criminals over to us.


254
00:26:06.416 --> 00:26:07.791
Yes, I watched the same debate.

255
00:26:08.208 --> 00:26:10.291
People say they have their thumbs cut.

256
00:26:10.416 --> 00:26:11.208
What?

257
00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:13.083
They have their thumbs cut.

258
00:26:13.958 --> 00:26:20.458
- They have their thumbs cut?
- Yes. To make it easier to do pickpocketing.


259
00:26:20.625 --> 00:26:23.625
Oh goodness! I’ve had enough.
I want them to leave.


260
00:26:25.125 --> 00:26:28.246
The state looks after them
better than it looks after us.


261
00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.999
Millions of our young
people are on the streets.


262
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.457
Just look at Ayten’s daughter.
She graduated from university...


263
00:26:35.458 --> 00:26:38.749
speaks a foreign language,
and she’s been without work for a year.


264
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:39.999
We don’t have to look after those people!

265
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
No, we're not.

266
00:26:41.458 --> 00:26:44.750
Don’t say that, Şermin. May God never
make anyone have to leave their homeland…


267
00:26:45.416 --> 00:26:47.957
They're enjoying themselves here for free.

268
00:26:47.958 --> 00:26:49.541
Who says they’re enjoying themselves?

269
00:26:49.875 --> 00:26:53.601
- They’re all working day and night for a pittance.
- We see it on the news every day: robberies, rape...


270
00:26:53.625 --> 00:26:57.416
Just the other day
they molested a four year old child…


271
00:26:58.416 --> 00:27:01.915
- God damn them.
- They all need to be deported!


272
00:27:01.916 --> 00:27:07.333
Before they came, this country had morals,
and order. Am I wrong?


273
00:27:07.666 --> 00:27:10.425
You're wrong. Five million refugees
live in this country.


274
00:27:10.449 --> 00:27:13.289
Women, children… You don’t mean
they’re all thieves and rapists, do you?


275
00:27:13.458 --> 00:27:19.082
You sound like you don’t have
a bit of humanity left in you…


276
00:27:19.083 --> 00:27:20.813
Müjde, I think you should
come to your senses, dear.


277
00:27:20.837 --> 00:27:23.157
You moved house, and
suddenly you’re talking all different.


278
00:27:23.375 --> 00:27:27.624
I wonder if you hear what you’re saying.
People struggle for life and death.


279
00:27:27.625 --> 00:27:31.082
You’re parroting the stupid things
you hear left and right.


280
00:27:31.083 --> 00:27:37.708
I guess you’re upset today.
Can’t you see what they did to our country?


281
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.833
If you like your country so much,
why did you send your son to Europe?


282
00:27:42.041 --> 00:27:46.249
Me? Have you woken up
on the wrong side of bed or what Müjde?


283
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:50.416
We’ve been staying on your good side
but you’re getting carried away.


284
00:27:50.583 --> 00:27:52.708
Hah, right on time.

285
00:27:52.833 --> 00:27:54.583
Eat sweet, talk sweet.

286
00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.500
I don't have an appetite.

287
00:29:47.958 --> 00:29:48.958
Kalbim.

288
00:29:49.958 --> 00:29:50.958
Are you hungry?

289
00:29:51.416 --> 00:29:52.791
Hope it's not burning already.

290
00:29:59.458 --> 00:30:01.541
Hmm. It is okay.

291
00:30:03.541 --> 00:30:06.833
It is perfect. Excellent.

292
00:30:11.916 --> 00:30:12.916
Are you crying?

293
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:17.250
Kalbim? Who make you cry?

294
00:30:18.208 --> 00:30:19.500
Nobody.

295
00:30:22.166 --> 00:30:25.125
Hey, you know you can tell me everything.

296
00:30:25.458 --> 00:30:27.708
There's nothing. Just-

297
00:30:28.166 --> 00:30:29.166
Is it because of me?

298
00:30:29.875 --> 00:30:31.125
No. No.

299
00:30:32.416 --> 00:30:34.125
I cause you a lot of problem.

300
00:30:35.041 --> 00:30:40.458
Sayyid, you are the best thing
that has happened to me.


301
00:30:41.541 --> 00:30:46.708
I am crying because I am happy.

302
00:31:27.708 --> 00:31:29.333
I liked it.

303
00:31:35.458 --> 00:31:36.666
Kalbim...

304
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:40.750
I have to tell you something.

305
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.125
I’m going back to Syria.

306
00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:57.040
I found my son.

307
00:31:58.410 --> 00:31:59.870
Rauf is alive.

308
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:07.370
You remember my friend? Hassan.
The doctor. I told you about.


309
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.259
There was a child in his
hospital who was a friend of Rauf,


310
00:32:14.283 --> 00:32:18.541
He was in a coma
but he started talking again.


311
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.860
And he told Hassan,
Rauf never went home that day.


312
00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:29.082
They were playing in the streets.
And when they bomb, they all ran away.


313
00:32:29.083 --> 00:32:33.415
So, Rauf is alive.
That's why I couldn't find Rauf's body.


314
00:32:33.416 --> 00:32:37.750
Because he's alive. 
He's not dead.

315
00:32:39.708 --> 00:32:43.416
I have to find him.
I can't leave him there.


316
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.625
Rauf is a very smart child.
He found a way to survive.


317
00:32:51.583 --> 00:32:52.791
Kalbim.

318
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:56.458
I'm coming with you.

319
00:32:58.333 --> 00:32:59.999
- No.
- Yes.


320
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.332
- No you're not coming.
- Yes I'm coming.


321
00:33:02.333 --> 00:33:05.957
Kalbim it's too dangerous.
The war is still going on.


322
00:33:05.958 --> 00:33:07.125
But you're going?

323
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.375
It's my son, I have no choice.

324
00:33:10.541 --> 00:33:14.124
I don't want you to go alone.
I won't let you go alone.


325
00:33:14.125 --> 00:33:18.625
Kalbim, please it's too dangerous.
I'm gonna bring my son.


326
00:33:19.791 --> 00:33:23.041
Sayyid I want to help you. 
What can I do?

327
00:33:23.166 --> 00:33:25.000
You already help me a lot.

328
00:33:27.166 --> 00:33:28.583
How much money you need?

329
00:33:29.083 --> 00:33:30.083
I have money.

330
00:33:30.833 --> 00:33:35.875
Sayyid. Please. You need money.
Please let me help you.


331
00:33:37.375 --> 00:33:39.458
Kalbim, you gave me everything.

332
00:33:40.375 --> 00:33:45.125
You gave me love. You gave me your heart.
You gave me life.


333
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.375
What more can you give?

334
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.666
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.


335
00:33:52.416 --> 00:33:55.208
I'm gonna find my son. 
No matter what.

336
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.166
And I'm going to come back.

337
00:33:59.083 --> 00:34:01.083
I love you Sayyid.

338
00:34:08.125 --> 00:34:09.375
I love you, Kalbim.

339
00:34:16.291 --> 00:34:17.333
Don't cry.

340
00:35:18.458 --> 00:35:20.000
Thank you.

341
00:35:20.666 --> 00:35:22.666
I have to go now.

342
00:35:23.041 --> 00:35:27.250
Don't worry, Sayyid. 
Rauf is alive.

343
00:41:08.166 --> 00:41:10.916
Mom! Mom! What happened mom?

344
00:41:11.125 --> 00:41:16.583
- Mom! Do you hear me? Are you okay?
- Miss Müjde!


345
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.041
- Call the ambulance!
- I'm calling.


346
00:41:19.625 --> 00:41:22.708
Mom, what happened to you?

347
00:41:24.541 --> 00:41:30.250
No pulse! Oh Miss Müjde!

348
00:41:30.916 --> 00:41:35.000
Did you call it,
did you call the ambulance?


349
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:29.000
- Serhat give me a cigarette.
- Of course.


350
00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:32.708
Here.

351
00:43:59.625 --> 00:44:02.721
All this for 3000 liras.
Was it worth it?


352
00:44:02.745 --> 00:44:06.541
You ruined your life, and
that poor woman’s too.


353
00:44:08.625 --> 00:44:11.416
- Sir?
- Fuck! What the hell?


354
00:44:31.375 --> 00:44:32.500
You son of a bitch!

355
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.333
Take them, now!

356
00:44:40.708 --> 00:44:42.041
Go! Take them!

357
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.333
Turkey belongs to Turks and it will be!
