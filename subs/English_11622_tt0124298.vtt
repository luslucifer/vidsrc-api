1
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.266
- Looks just as good.
- Where do you get these?


2
00:01:43.434 --> 00:01:45.519
- He's got a million.
- They're so funny.


3
00:01:45.686 --> 00:01:48.647
Just remember,
don't mention the Communists.


4
00:01:48.815 --> 00:01:50.857
Calvin's a great guy,
but he's a little....


5
00:01:51.025 --> 00:01:52.859
- Nutty?
- What's his wife like?


6
00:01:53.027 --> 00:01:55.987
- You know, housewife.
- Likes to cook.


7
00:01:56.155 --> 00:01:58.156
- Pregnant.
- Normal, then.


8
00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:00.200
I wouldn't go that far.

9
00:02:00.368 --> 00:02:01.910
- Helen. Hi.
- Oh, hi, Betty.


10
00:02:02.078 --> 00:02:04.871
- Hi, Dave.
- Just look at you.


11
00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.374
- Any day now.
- Say hi to my sister, Ruth...


12
00:02:07.542 --> 00:02:09.668
Tell me if you heard this one.

13
00:02:09.836 --> 00:02:12.379
- A duck walks into a drugstore.
- Ha, ha.


14
00:02:12.547 --> 00:02:15.048
He says, "I'd like some lip gloss."

15
00:02:15.216 --> 00:02:18.218
The clerk says, "Certainly, sir.
Will this be cash or check?"


16
00:02:18.386 --> 00:02:22.139
- The duck says, "Put it on my bill." Ah?
- Ha-ha-ha.


17
00:02:24.434 --> 00:02:25.559
Oh, brother.

18
00:02:25.726 --> 00:02:28.687
He was a golden-boy professor
at Caltech.


19
00:02:28.855 --> 00:02:30.605
But then he started inventing things.

20
00:02:30.857 --> 00:02:36.111
He suddenly became very rich,
and that was it, he quit teaching.


21
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.115
- How's that?
- Just what the doctor ordered. Ha, ha!


22
00:02:40.283 --> 00:02:45.412
Calvin spends all of his time out there,
tinkering around in the workshop.


23
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.914
If you ask me, it's all very strange.

24
00:02:48.082 --> 00:02:49.416
Same is true of batteries.

25
00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:55.255
I could take your simple yacht battery
and rig it to last a decade, easily.


26
00:02:55.882 --> 00:02:56.923
Say, Helen...

27
00:02:57.091 --> 00:02:59.926
what does Calvin think
about this trouble down in Cuba?


28
00:03:00.094 --> 00:03:03.722
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
please don't bring that up.


29
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.736
I'd say my baseball card collection
is as complete as any one I've ever seen.


30
00:03:17.904 --> 00:03:20.405
Calvin? Hey, Calvin, Calvin.

31
00:03:20.573 --> 00:03:24.284
Kennedy is going toe to toe
with Khrushchev on television right now.


32
00:03:24.452 --> 00:03:26.953
- What?
- Ooh, boy.


33
00:03:27.163 --> 00:03:28.747
On the island of Cuba...

34
00:03:28.956 --> 00:03:32.125
unmistakable evidence
has established the fact...


35
00:03:32.293 --> 00:03:35.587
that a series
of offensive missile sites...


36
00:03:35.755 --> 00:03:39.883
is now in preparation
on that imprisoned island.


37
00:03:56.484 --> 00:03:59.819
Tower, this is Wolf 1.
I got five miles to the overhead.


38
00:03:59.987 --> 00:04:02.113
Wolf 1, Tower, report the numbers.

39
00:04:02.281 --> 00:04:03.782
You're number one for the overhead.

40
00:04:06.994 --> 00:04:09.329
Tower, this is Wolf 1,
I got a problem here.


41
00:04:09.497 --> 00:04:12.541
State your problem, Wolf 1.
Are you declaring an emergency?


42
00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:14.626
Stand by, 1.

43
00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.629
Additional sites appear
to be designed...


44
00:04:17.797 --> 00:04:19.798
for intermediate-range
ballistic missiles...


45
00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:23.343
and thus capable of striking
most of the major cities...


46
00:04:23.511 --> 00:04:25.679
in the western hemisphere.

47
00:04:25.846 --> 00:04:30.517
Folks, given this extraordinary turn
of events...


48
00:04:30.685 --> 00:04:33.311
I think it's prudent
we cut this evening short.


49
00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.730
I'm sure this Cuban thing
will resolve itself...


50
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.148
but in the meantime...

51
00:04:37.316 --> 00:04:40.986
I suggest we take
a prayerful watch-and-wait stance.


52
00:04:42.822 --> 00:04:44.531
Okay, folks, let's go.

53
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.992
Bye, Helen.
Wish it could have been longer.


54
00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:48.743
- My coat.
- Oh, here you go.


55
00:04:48.953 --> 00:04:51.079
I'll call you, Betty.

56
00:04:54.458 --> 00:04:55.500
What did I tell you?

57
00:04:56.877 --> 00:04:58.044
Thank you.

58
00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:03.717
I'm not gonna let this pot roast
go to waste.


59
00:05:03.884 --> 00:05:07.262
Calvin, could you put that seat cushion
back on the lawn chair, honey?


60
00:05:07.471 --> 00:05:09.598
Shouldn't we at least
turn off the phonograph?


61
00:05:09.765 --> 00:05:12.559
- It shuts off automatically.
- Oh. Did you rig it to do that?


62
00:05:12.727 --> 00:05:14.728
- They all do.
- Oh.


63
00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:16.563
I never know anymore.

64
00:05:18.524 --> 00:05:22.902
I'll bet that's a fighter jet
on its way to Key West.


65
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.404
Good luck, amigo.

66
00:05:24.614 --> 00:05:26.448
An emergency has been declared.

67
00:05:26.616 --> 00:05:28.199
An emergency has been declared.

68
00:05:28.367 --> 00:05:32.579
You hear that?
I'll come back for the radio.


69
00:05:32.747 --> 00:05:35.749
Oh, Calvin, I wish you would've
at least let me do the dishes.


70
00:05:35.916 --> 00:05:39.419
It's not gonna be easy to get
all this dried-on food off my nice plates.


71
00:05:39.587 --> 00:05:42.255
I just hope those plates
are not radioactive by tomorrow.


72
00:05:42.423 --> 00:05:44.883
Well, cheese
is particularly troublesome.


73
00:05:45.092 --> 00:05:47.093
I've got secondaries of an engine fire.

74
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:49.721
I'm gonna need to find a clear area
to eject.


75
00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.266
Roger, Wolf 1.
Can you make it to the ocean?


76
00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:57.020
Roger that, Tower.

77
00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:03.443
I'm marking the 180 radial for five
and ejecting, Tower.


78
00:06:03.611 --> 00:06:05.028
Roger, Wolf 1.

79
00:06:17.833 --> 00:06:20.794
So how long will we
have to stay down here?


80
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:23.630
For this thing to blow over
could take days.


81
00:06:23.798 --> 00:06:26.383
Days? Honey, what if I go into labor?

82
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.593
That could happen any time now.

83
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:29.803
I've read up on it.

84
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.765
If I have to,
I'll deliver the baby myself.


85
00:06:59.792 --> 00:07:02.001
Home, sweet home.

86
00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:03.461
To you, maybe.

87
00:07:15.307 --> 00:07:18.852
- Are you all right?
- I think so.


88
00:07:21.355 --> 00:07:25.692
Aah! It's happened.
Aah, look at that heat.


89
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.488
All my surface indicators knocked out.
Oh, Lord!


90
00:07:30.656 --> 00:07:32.198
It's happened.

91
00:07:39.123 --> 00:07:40.415
What was that noise?

92
00:07:43.127 --> 00:07:44.335
The locks.

93
00:07:45.337 --> 00:07:46.921
The locks?

94
00:07:49.216 --> 00:07:52.719
To keep us from trying to leave.

95
00:07:52.887 --> 00:07:56.765
There's a radiation half-life
after an atomic blast.


96
00:07:56.932 --> 00:07:58.391
It lasts 35 years.

97
00:07:59.518 --> 00:08:01.227
Thirty-five years?

98
00:08:01.854 --> 00:08:06.274
Then, after that, it's safe to go up.

99
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:14.073
According to Caltech, this Webber guy
was a bona fide genius...


100
00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:15.909
but a borderline nutcase.

101
00:08:16.076 --> 00:08:20.038
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have
been out here when the plane hit.


102
00:08:20.206 --> 00:08:22.957
Unless we get a postcard or something,
that'd be my guess.


103
00:08:23.167 --> 00:08:26.586
- What about relatives?
- They're all back east.


104
00:08:26.754 --> 00:08:30.256
Neighbors over there said
the guy spent day and night out here.


105
00:08:30.424 --> 00:08:34.761
She'd bring him sandwiches
and hot Dr Pepper.


106
00:08:36.096 --> 00:08:39.265
- He drank it hot?
- Yeah.


107
00:08:39.767 --> 00:08:41.810
Good God.

108
00:08:59.954 --> 00:09:02.247
Hi, hon. Feeling better?

109
00:09:02.414 --> 00:09:03.748
No.

110
00:09:03.916 --> 00:09:05.542
We have to be strong...

111
00:09:05.709 --> 00:09:09.504
if not for ourselves, for the child.

112
00:09:14.134 --> 00:09:15.635
All our friends....

113
00:09:15.803 --> 00:09:17.971
Burnt to a crisp.

114
00:09:19.723 --> 00:09:23.017
- I'm not hungry.
- Hot Dr Pepper. Your favorite.


115
00:09:23.185 --> 00:09:26.104
No, Calvin, your favorite.

116
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:28.857
Really?

117
00:09:32.027 --> 00:09:34.863
Chilly? Shouldn't be.

118
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.533
- Temperature's a nice 73 degrees.
- Oh, maybe I've just got the creeps.


119
00:09:38.701 --> 00:09:41.077
How could you? 
This is just like home.

120
00:09:41.287 --> 00:09:44.163
No. No, Calvin.

121
00:09:44.331 --> 00:09:46.875
This is different, believe me.

122
00:09:47.084 --> 00:09:48.710
Would you like a tranquilizer?

123
00:09:50.087 --> 00:09:54.591
- You've got tranquilizers?
- I told you, I have everything.


124
00:09:56.594 --> 00:09:58.136
- What?
- Oh.


125
00:09:58.929 --> 00:10:00.763
Oh, hon.

126
00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:05.602
It's gonna be all right.
Yeah. Just breathe.


127
00:10:06.729 --> 00:10:08.771
I'll get my stuff.

128
00:10:12.192 --> 00:10:15.653
Oh, it's a good day
For singin' a song


129
00:10:15.821 --> 00:10:18.948
And it's a good day
For movin' along


130
00:10:19.116 --> 00:10:22.869
Yes, it's a good day
How could anything go wrong?


131
00:10:23.037 --> 00:10:25.538
A good day
From mornin' till night


132
00:10:25.706 --> 00:10:27.707
- Yes it's a good day
- It's a lovely day


133
00:10:27.875 --> 00:10:28.958
For shinin' your shoes

134
00:10:29.126 --> 00:10:31.377
- And it's a good day
- If you want a silver linin'


135
00:10:31.545 --> 00:10:32.587
For losin' the blues

136
00:10:32.755 --> 00:10:34.881
Everything to gain
And nothing to lose


137
00:10:36.425 --> 00:10:38.259
'Cause it's a good day
From mornin' to night


138
00:10:38.427 --> 00:10:39.469
You're right!

139
00:10:39.637 --> 00:10:43.139
I said to the sun "Good mornin', sun!"

140
00:10:43.307 --> 00:10:46.601
- Is there a problem?
- No, Calvin, babies cry.


141
00:10:47.561 --> 00:10:50.146
- I've noticed.
- What should we call him?


142
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.148
I don't know.

143
00:10:52.316 --> 00:10:55.151
Well, I was thinking
in light of the situation...


144
00:10:55.319 --> 00:10:57.195
we should call him Adam.

145
00:10:57.363 --> 00:11:01.324
- That's not sacrilegious, is it?
- No, I think it's just right.


146
00:11:02.576 --> 00:11:05.912
And I was wondering if.... If....

147
00:11:07.247 --> 00:11:09.457
Whatever you want, Helen.

148
00:11:09.625 --> 00:11:11.084
I want a bedroom ceiling.

149
00:11:15.214 --> 00:11:16.631
You got it.

150
00:11:19.426 --> 00:11:22.595
'Cause it's a good day
For payin' your bills


151
00:11:22.763 --> 00:11:25.890
And it's a good day
For curin' your ills


152
00:11:26.058 --> 00:11:29.352
So take a deep breath
Throw away all your pills


153
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.813
'Cause it's a good day
From mornin' till night


154
00:11:31.981 --> 00:11:34.857
See, I flick this switch...

155
00:11:35.025 --> 00:11:38.361
and the image is projected
onto a mirror...


156
00:11:38.529 --> 00:11:41.614
and the picture comes out here,
and it's perfect.


157
00:11:51.083 --> 00:11:53.751
- Well, almost perfect.
- Jackie Gleason.


158
00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:58.297
You know something? People will
never get tired of watching these.


159
00:12:08.142 --> 00:12:09.142
Lord...

160
00:12:09.309 --> 00:12:12.478
bless this food, this family...

161
00:12:12.688 --> 00:12:15.314
and make us ever mindful
of the needs of others.


162
00:12:15.482 --> 00:12:18.317
- Amen.
- Amen.


163
00:12:18.736 --> 00:12:20.111
Let's eat.

164
00:12:36.712 --> 00:12:38.087
Calvin?

165
00:12:38.756 --> 00:12:42.508
- Out here, hon.
- Oh, there you are.


166
00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.636
We've looked all over for you.

167
00:12:47.014 --> 00:12:49.057
What are you doing back here?

168
00:12:49.224 --> 00:12:52.685
- I was just examining this rear hatchway.
- Why?


169
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.691
Well, it's pretty clear that when the bomb
went off, the front entrance caved in...


170
00:12:58.859 --> 00:13:02.945
so, you know, we'll have to return
to the surface using this back entrance...


171
00:13:03.113 --> 00:13:05.948
which is very nice
because it has the service elevator.


172
00:13:06.992 --> 00:13:10.745
- Unless it's caved in too.
- Well, yes.


173
00:13:10.913 --> 00:13:16.084
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. You ready, Adam? Watch this.


174
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.088
He can stand up all by himself.
Show Daddy.


175
00:13:20.297 --> 00:13:23.049
- All by himself. Stand up, Adam.
- That's my guy.


176
00:13:23.217 --> 00:13:24.300
Stand up.

177
00:13:24.802 --> 00:13:26.552
My son.

178
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.057
Up, Adam, to the moon.

179
00:13:46.073 --> 00:13:47.865
Hey, boss.

180
00:13:48.033 --> 00:13:49.242
What do you make of this?

181
00:13:49.409 --> 00:13:51.911
- Damned if I know.
- Bet it's some kind of septic tank.


182
00:13:52.079 --> 00:13:54.247
Never seen a septic tank
that looked like that.


183
00:13:54.414 --> 00:13:57.500
Don't fool with it. If it is a septic tank,
I don't wanna open it.


184
00:13:57.668 --> 00:13:59.502
We'll just lay the foundation over it.

185
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:09.387
"In Wonderland."

186
00:14:09.555 --> 00:14:14.142
I'd like to see the public school system
match that. I don't care how terrific it is.


187
00:14:14.309 --> 00:14:16.477
Don't you think
he's a little young for school?


188
00:14:16.645 --> 00:14:19.522
People have no idea
what the human mind is capable of.


189
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:24.735
Look, Daddy. Alice went down a hole,
just like us.


190
00:14:24.903 --> 00:14:27.363
Will I ever get
to go up on top?

191
00:14:27.531 --> 00:14:31.200
Yes, you certainly will,
and you'll find a nice girl...


192
00:14:31.368 --> 00:14:33.995
and rebuild America
just the way it used to be.


193
00:14:34.163 --> 00:14:38.124
Oh, Calvin. I'm not sure we should be
making promises that perhaps can't be kept.


194
00:14:38.292 --> 00:14:40.293
I'm convinced there'll be
other survivors.


195
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.546
In fact, I'm guessing there's life
on the surface even now.


196
00:14:43.714 --> 00:14:47.800
Not life worth living, perhaps,
but believe me...


197
00:14:47.968 --> 00:14:49.927
something is moving around up there.

198
00:15:04.067 --> 00:15:06.736
I'm gonna need two more
banana splits and a Cherry Coke.


199
00:15:06.904 --> 00:15:08.321
You bet, Mom. Coming up.

200
00:15:08.488 --> 00:15:11.657
Oh, by the way, 
Mom, thanks for the job.

201
00:15:11.825 --> 00:15:14.160
- Buck-15 an hour.
- He's cute.


202
00:15:17.414 --> 00:15:19.123
Your husband is crazy.

203
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.335
All right, what's the big news?

204
00:15:22.502 --> 00:15:26.589
- Ha-ha-ha. Ah.
- Oh, you're a riot.


205
00:15:26.757 --> 00:15:31.594
Oh, what a riot you are. Ha-ha-ha.

206
00:15:31.762 --> 00:15:34.555
- Watch this.
- Very funny. Ha-ha-ha!


207
00:15:34.723 --> 00:15:36.599
- Ha-ha-ha!
- You're a real riot.


208
00:15:36.767 --> 00:15:39.018
They're coming now to put you
on a stage.


209
00:15:39.228 --> 00:15:41.312
There's been complaints
about me on the bus.


210
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.398
He's sending me
to the company psychiatrist.


211
00:15:44.566 --> 00:15:47.068
- Psychiatrist?
- Yeah, psychiatrist.


212
00:15:47.236 --> 00:15:50.655
- And that means I'm crazy.
- Oh, don't be silly, Ralph.


213
00:15:50.864 --> 00:15:54.116
Just sending you to a psychiatrist
doesn't mean you're crazy.


214
00:15:54.368 --> 00:15:56.410
Stick it. That's right.

215
00:15:56.578 --> 00:16:00.623
Hook off the jab. That's right.
Bob and weave. Bob and weave.


216
00:16:00.791 --> 00:16:02.124
Okay. Bob and weave.

217
00:16:02.292 --> 00:16:05.628
Excuse me, boys,
but I believe it's my turn now.


218
00:16:16.765 --> 00:16:20.268
Three, four, five...

219
00:16:20.435 --> 00:16:23.729
five, six, six, spin.

220
00:16:33.865 --> 00:16:36.951
- May I cut in?
- You certainly may.


221
00:16:37.202 --> 00:16:39.245
Thank you, sir.

222
00:17:15.198 --> 00:17:19.285
I miss those nice flower-power kids.
How about you?


223
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.829
Ugh.

224
00:17:24.041 --> 00:17:25.499
I've heard people say

225
00:17:28.253 --> 00:17:30.713
What the hell kind of music is that?

226
00:17:32.215 --> 00:17:34.258
Oh, man.

227
00:17:34.426 --> 00:17:36.761
I'm not sure I like that.

228
00:17:37.929 --> 00:17:39.930
Change it.

229
00:17:40.098 --> 00:17:43.184
We've shared love and made love

230
00:17:44.353 --> 00:17:46.479
It's just not enough

231
00:17:46.646 --> 00:17:49.106
Oh, oh, babe

232
00:17:52.069 --> 00:17:55.279
My darling, I

233
00:17:55.447 --> 00:17:58.699
Can't get enough of your love, babe

234
00:17:59.659 --> 00:18:02.161
These are stock certificates.

235
00:18:02.329 --> 00:18:06.040
Your mom and I bought them for you.

236
00:18:06.208 --> 00:18:11.379
Of course, they're worthless now,
but at one time they were quite valuable.


237
00:18:11.588 --> 00:18:14.256
They're pretty. 
Could I have them?

238
00:18:14.466 --> 00:18:15.674
Heh. Sure.

239
00:18:15.842 --> 00:18:19.970
Now, let's move on to our French exam.

240
00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.265
Latin exam, Dad. It's Tuesday.

241
00:18:25.394 --> 00:18:29.980
Gosh, it is Tuesday.
Time flies, doesn't it?


242
00:18:44.204 --> 00:18:48.207
You have a wonderful sense
of humor, son, I must say.


243
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:52.711
The acorn does not fall very far
from the tree.


244
00:18:53.296 --> 00:18:57.007
Oh, no! Agh! Oh, jeez. No.

245
00:18:57.175 --> 00:18:58.384
- I got you.
- I got...


246
00:18:58.552 --> 00:19:01.512
- Hi, hon.
- Hi.


247
00:19:06.643 --> 00:19:07.852
This is wonderful.

248
00:19:08.478 --> 00:19:12.940
It's my baseball card collection.
It's yours now.


249
00:19:14.067 --> 00:19:17.486
- What's baseball?
- It's a game, son.


250
00:19:17.654 --> 00:19:21.824
I can explain it pretty easily.
You see, there's a pitcher.


251
00:19:21.992 --> 00:19:23.909
Oh, like a painting?

252
00:19:24.286 --> 00:19:26.912
No. A pitcher.

253
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.165
Like one of Mom's?

254
00:19:29.332 --> 00:19:33.419
No, there's a man who throws the ball
to a man who has a bat.


255
00:19:33.587 --> 00:19:36.964
- Oh, the nocturnal flying mammal?
- No.


256
00:20:00.906 --> 00:20:05.367
I'm selling this place.
I want out of this hellhole.


257
00:20:05.535 --> 00:20:08.287
Whoa. Uh....

258
00:20:08.455 --> 00:20:10.080
Could I, uh...?

259
00:20:10.248 --> 00:20:13.125
If you sell, uh....

260
00:20:13.752 --> 00:20:15.794
Me.... Could I, uh...?

261
00:20:15.962 --> 00:20:19.006
- Buy it from me?
- Yeah, yeah, that's it.


262
00:20:19.174 --> 00:20:23.135
- I'll give it to you, no money down.
- Cool.


263
00:20:23.845 --> 00:20:26.805
This neighborhood's going to hell,
anyway.


264
00:20:27.974 --> 00:20:31.936
At last! I am
master of all I survey!

265
00:20:35.982 --> 00:20:37.066
No, no. Listen.

266
00:20:37.817 --> 00:20:40.444
I'm only gonna explain this
one more time.


267
00:20:40.612 --> 00:20:43.197
The runner on second goes to third.

268
00:20:43.365 --> 00:20:46.033
- It's... He's out there.
- Why?


269
00:20:46.201 --> 00:20:49.537
Because he's forced out.
It's... It's a force.


270
00:20:50.705 --> 00:20:54.875
- Then why go there?
- Because he must.


271
00:20:55.043 --> 00:20:58.212
- Calvin.
- Coming.


272
00:21:01.007 --> 00:21:02.174
Yes, dear?

273
00:21:02.342 --> 00:21:04.552
You get the presents,
I'll get the lights.


274
00:21:04.761 --> 00:21:06.262
You bet.

275
00:21:07.889 --> 00:21:12.142
Happy birthday to you

276
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:16.146
And many more

277
00:21:16.314 --> 00:21:17.773
Ha!

278
00:21:18.525 --> 00:21:20.901
Thanks, Mom. Thank you, Dad.

279
00:21:21.152 --> 00:21:22.194
Blow out the candles.

280
00:21:22.362 --> 00:21:24.113
- Make a wish.
- Um....


281
00:21:30.161 --> 00:21:31.662
Here.

282
00:21:40.213 --> 00:21:43.215
Oh, boy, a jacket.

283
00:21:43.383 --> 00:21:46.385
- Your mom made that all by herself.
- No kidding?


284
00:21:46.553 --> 00:21:50.389
No kidding. Who else would have done it?

285
00:21:50.557 --> 00:21:52.600
I made these.

286
00:22:00.692 --> 00:22:02.985
Holy cow.

287
00:22:03.194 --> 00:22:05.070
What the heck are these?

288
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.574
It's your roller skates, yup.
I redesigned them.


289
00:22:08.742 --> 00:22:11.577
These are really swell. I mean swell.

290
00:22:11.745 --> 00:22:13.412
Well, what did you wish for, son?

291
00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.457
- If he tells, it won't come true.
- That's a bunch of baloney.


292
00:22:16.625 --> 00:22:20.502
- My family never believed that.
- Well, we did, in my family.


293
00:22:20.712 --> 00:22:23.213
I wished that I could meet a girl.

294
00:22:24.424 --> 00:22:27.593
- Oh, well, a nice one?
- Yes, ma'am.


295
00:22:27.802 --> 00:22:32.264
- One that doesn't glow in the dark.
- Calvin Webber, what a thing to say.


296
00:22:32.474 --> 00:22:35.601
Well, we'll be going up in two years.
We'll know then.


297
00:22:35.769 --> 00:22:36.977
I'm very hopeful.

298
00:22:38.355 --> 00:22:39.521
Me too.

299
00:22:39.731 --> 00:22:40.939
- Elbows, son.
- Mm?


300
00:22:41.107 --> 00:22:43.734
Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.
What the heck am I thinking tonight?


301
00:22:43.902 --> 00:22:47.279
Well, you never know.
You might someday dine with the president.


302
00:22:47.447 --> 00:22:49.531
If we still have one. Ha, ha.

303
00:22:50.992 --> 00:22:54.578
You know, when we do go up,
I'm gonna miss this place.


304
00:22:57.832 --> 00:22:58.916
How about you, hon?

305
00:23:05.131 --> 00:23:07.633
Would you please excuse me?

306
00:23:07.801 --> 00:23:10.302
No, no, no, don't get up.

307
00:24:12.407 --> 00:24:16.201
- Should we say a prayer first?
- Just open the door.


308
00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:32.885
Long time.

309
00:24:35.764 --> 00:24:38.891
Well, it's dirty...

310
00:24:42.103 --> 00:24:44.396
but it seems to be okay.

311
00:24:47.859 --> 00:24:49.651
I know you're happy.

312
00:24:52.655 --> 00:24:54.948
Do we just go on up?

313
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:57.075
No, son.

314
00:24:57.243 --> 00:25:00.621
Now is the time
we must be at our most cautious.


315
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:04.166
- We wait for night.
- Oh, shit.


316
00:25:04.918 --> 00:25:06.418
Helen Thomas Webber...

317
00:25:06.628 --> 00:25:10.255
maybe we have been down here
a little too long.


318
00:25:11.049 --> 00:25:12.549
Pardon her French, son.

319
00:25:13.092 --> 00:25:14.593
"Shit" is French?

320
00:25:15.929 --> 00:25:17.179
Well, it's archaic French.

321
00:25:17.347 --> 00:25:22.476
It's a 16th-century colloquialism
meaning, roughly, "good."


322
00:25:22.685 --> 00:25:24.353
Your father's right.

323
00:25:24.521 --> 00:25:26.146
Well...

324
00:25:26.314 --> 00:25:27.648
shit.

325
00:25:30.151 --> 00:25:31.193
Ah.

326
00:25:42.997 --> 00:25:45.207
All of these things...

327
00:25:45.375 --> 00:25:50.838
Alcoholics Anonymous, Cocaine
Anonymous, uh, Heroin Anonymous...


328
00:25:51.005 --> 00:25:53.131
There's a Heroin Anonymous?

329
00:25:53.299 --> 00:25:56.301
Will you please shut up?

330
00:25:56.469 --> 00:25:57.845
Sorry, sorry.

331
00:25:58.012 --> 00:26:04.518
All of these things ask you to believe in
a power greater than yourself.


332
00:26:04.686 --> 00:26:08.897
Well, I have lifted my eyes skyward
a time or two...


333
00:26:09.065 --> 00:26:12.776
and I certainly have not seen
anything coming from up there.


334
00:26:12.944 --> 00:26:15.320
Except a goddamn airplane.

335
00:26:15.488 --> 00:26:18.323
Which I can't afford to get on.
Ha-ha-ha!


336
00:26:20.285 --> 00:26:22.828
Whoa, earthquake. 
Another earthquake.

337
00:26:22.996 --> 00:26:26.248
Let her come, let her come.
Let's get this over with.


338
00:26:36.342 --> 00:26:38.969
Oh, God. Oh, God.

339
00:26:40.513 --> 00:26:42.639
Oh, God.

340
00:26:42.807 --> 00:26:45.142
Oh, my God.

341
00:26:45.351 --> 00:26:47.144
Oh, God, save me.

342
00:26:50.023 --> 00:26:53.150
For I have seen the light.

343
00:27:02.285 --> 00:27:04.202
I come...

344
00:27:04.704 --> 00:27:06.371
in peace.

345
00:27:23.306 --> 00:27:27.184
Leave my elevator alone.

346
00:27:48.164 --> 00:27:51.458
What happened to my back yard?

347
00:28:29.414 --> 00:28:31.123
Got a light, honey?

348
00:28:31.874 --> 00:28:36.378
A light? Yes, I do have a light.

349
00:28:38.548 --> 00:28:40.632
Good. Thank you.

350
00:28:41.426 --> 00:28:45.929
- So you survived the blast.
- The blast? Ha, ha.


351
00:28:46.097 --> 00:28:48.056
Honey, I've survived a host of things.

352
00:28:48.224 --> 00:28:51.184
Like the song says,
a country boy can survive.


353
00:28:51.394 --> 00:28:53.228
Did you say you were a country boy?

354
00:28:53.438 --> 00:28:56.940
Cute little old man,
if you want a boy, I can be a boy...


355
00:28:57.108 --> 00:28:58.984
and if you want a girl, 
I can be a girl.

356
00:28:59.152 --> 00:29:00.610
I can be whatever
you want me to be.

357
00:29:00.778 --> 00:29:02.279
- Really?
- Uh-huh.


358
00:29:02.488 --> 00:29:05.365
It's all yours
for the remarkably low price of $200.


359
00:29:05.575 --> 00:29:08.869
And if you act now, I may even
throw in some free lawn furniture.


360
00:29:09.037 --> 00:29:10.620
Now, how about that?

361
00:29:10.788 --> 00:29:13.123
No. Thanks.

362
00:29:13.291 --> 00:29:17.044
- Thank you. I have to go.
- Go.


363
00:29:17.211 --> 00:29:19.171
I have to go.

364
00:29:19.338 --> 00:29:21.840
Get out of here, you old drunk.

365
00:29:27.263 --> 00:29:30.182
Surprise. Bang! Ha-ha-ha.

366
00:29:30.349 --> 00:29:32.225
Oh!

367
00:29:36.814 --> 00:29:38.815
No!

368
00:29:41.611 --> 00:29:43.278
I'm gonna give it to you straight.

369
00:29:43.446 --> 00:29:45.447
There's no point
beating around the bush.


370
00:29:45.615 --> 00:29:46.698
There were survivors.

371
00:29:47.158 --> 00:29:52.287
Apparently, the fallout
has created a subspecies, mutants.


372
00:29:53.372 --> 00:29:55.332
Mutants?

373
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:59.294
Not a pretty sight.
Some eat out of garbage cans, others...


374
00:29:59.462 --> 00:30:01.630
Cover your ears, son, and hum.

375
00:30:01.798 --> 00:30:04.382
I mean that literally.
I mean it right now.


376
00:30:06.302 --> 00:30:09.930
Others are multisexual.

377
00:30:10.139 --> 00:30:14.476
It seems they can be both masculine
and feminine simultaneously.


378
00:30:14.644 --> 00:30:16.061
- No.
- Yes.


379
00:30:16.229 --> 00:30:17.771
- I don't believe it.
- Believe it.


380
00:30:17.939 --> 00:30:20.857
He tried to sell me his body, Helen.

381
00:30:21.025 --> 00:30:24.319
They offer lawn furniture as a come-on.

382
00:30:27.156 --> 00:30:28.365
All right.

383
00:30:28.533 --> 00:30:30.367
They have done a lot of rebuilding...

384
00:30:30.576 --> 00:30:33.787
though society, at least
as we know it, has totally collapsed.


385
00:30:33.955 --> 00:30:37.290
People throw up in the streets.
Others point guns.


386
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.168
There's something terribly wrong
with the automobiles.


387
00:30:40.336 --> 00:30:44.548
I can't tell you the rest, I just can't.
Maybe someday.


388
00:30:44.715 --> 00:30:47.384
- So, what do we do now?
- We stay down here.


389
00:30:47.552 --> 00:30:49.678
- We do?
- Yes. We'll make do.


390
00:30:49.846 --> 00:30:52.305
We have clothes,
we have running water from a well.


391
00:30:52.473 --> 00:30:55.100
I am convinced these mutants
will kill each other off...


392
00:30:55.268 --> 00:30:58.770
No, Calvin, we won't make do.
Not me, not Adam.


393
00:30:58.938 --> 00:31:00.272
We're going up.

394
00:31:00.439 --> 00:31:02.858
I don't care how horrible it is.
We deserve it.


395
00:31:03.025 --> 00:31:06.361
- I am the head of this household.
- I want him to at least see the sky.


396
00:31:06.529 --> 00:31:09.156
- We will.
- The ocean, a mountain.


397
00:31:09.323 --> 00:31:11.616
Do as I say!

398
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.168
- Dad?
- Ugh!


399
00:31:21.335 --> 00:31:22.878
- Son...!
- Oh, Adam.


400
00:31:23.045 --> 00:31:25.255
Oh, my goodness.
Let's get him to the bedroom.


401
00:31:26.632 --> 00:31:29.551
He seems to be doing all right now.

402
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.636
I don't know if
he had a heart attack...

403
00:31:31.804 --> 00:31:35.307
or just a horrifying experience,
but we need supplies...


404
00:31:35.474 --> 00:31:37.559
and I've gotta stay with him.

405
00:31:37.727 --> 00:31:38.894
I'll go up.

406
00:31:39.687 --> 00:31:43.106
- I'm afraid you must.
- I'll be all right.


407
00:31:43.691 --> 00:31:45.859
My brave boy.

408
00:31:47.778 --> 00:31:51.531
Just act normal.
And if anyone asks, simply say:


409
00:31:51.699 --> 00:31:53.992
"I'm from out of town.
I'm here on business."


410
00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.453
- Here on business.
- Write that down.


411
00:31:56.954 --> 00:31:59.581
Now, I'm gonna give you
a shopping list and some money.


412
00:31:59.749 --> 00:32:02.334
We'll need enough to get
through the next year or two.


413
00:32:02.501 --> 00:32:05.921
You'll find these items at what used
to be called a grocery store...


414
00:32:06.088 --> 00:32:08.298
or a hardware store. 
Write that down.

415
00:32:08.466 --> 00:32:11.468
I don't know how far
you'll have to travel to find supplies...


416
00:32:11.636 --> 00:32:15.680
but if you can't get home by nightfall,
I want you to look for a Holiday Inn.


417
00:32:15.848 --> 00:32:20.769
It's a hotel. Write that down.
There might still be one left standing.


418
00:32:20.937 --> 00:32:22.395
Oh.

419
00:32:22.772 --> 00:32:25.982
- Well, let's get you packed.
- Right.


420
00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:28.026
Just hope this is still good up there.

421
00:32:28.194 --> 00:32:29.945
- Say, Mom?
- Yes, dear?


422
00:32:30.112 --> 00:32:31.821
I was wondering, um...

423
00:32:31.989 --> 00:32:34.950
you know, while I was up there
and all, I was thinking....


424
00:32:35.117 --> 00:32:38.578
Well, you know,
I was wondering if maybe I could, uh...


425
00:32:39.205 --> 00:32:41.039
meet a girl.

426
00:32:41.832 --> 00:32:45.877
I've been thinking about that a little.
Just these last 15 years or so.


427
00:32:46.087 --> 00:32:49.464
Oh, Adam, it would be wonderful
if you could meet a girl.


428
00:32:49.632 --> 00:32:52.509
One who's not a mutant
and hopefully comes from Pasadena.


429
00:32:52.677 --> 00:32:55.887
Nothing against Valley girls,
but in my day, anyhow...


430
00:32:56.055 --> 00:32:59.766
girls from Pasadena, I don't know,
just always seemed a little bit nicer.


431
00:32:59.934 --> 00:33:04.354
Oh, and, son, there's also something
called a liquor store.


432
00:33:04.522 --> 00:33:06.106
Write that down.

433
00:33:06.274 --> 00:33:08.149
Liquor store.

434
00:33:25.418 --> 00:33:27.085
Calvin?

435
00:33:33.259 --> 00:33:34.467
Son.

436
00:33:41.642 --> 00:33:43.018
Adam.

437
00:33:43.185 --> 00:33:44.436
Yes, Father?

438
00:33:44.603 --> 00:33:50.900
Don't forget:
Stay out of the adult bookstore.


439
00:33:51.485 --> 00:33:54.696
Adult bookstore. Why?

440
00:33:55.698 --> 00:33:59.868
Poison gas. Invisible.

441
00:34:01.495 --> 00:34:03.163
Don't forget.

442
00:34:03.331 --> 00:34:06.249
I promise. Is that all?

443
00:34:06.417 --> 00:34:07.959
Uh.

444
00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:13.506
One more thing.

445
00:34:15.843 --> 00:34:20.805
If you find a healthy young woman...

446
00:34:22.558 --> 00:34:24.517
bring her on down.

447
00:34:25.978 --> 00:34:27.354
Yes, sir.

448
00:34:27.938 --> 00:34:29.397
Uh.

449
00:34:49.877 --> 00:34:51.503
Are you all right?

450
00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:55.340
Yes, yes. Oh, Lord, yes.

451
00:34:55.508 --> 00:34:59.260
Are you the one who came last night
all in yellow?


452
00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:03.223
All in yellow? 
Oh, that was my father.

453
00:35:04.016 --> 00:35:06.059
Oh, of course. The father.

454
00:35:06.852 --> 00:35:11.523
Forgive me.
Can you forgive me for my wasted life?


455
00:35:11.732 --> 00:35:13.608
Everything has been so awful.

456
00:35:13.859 --> 00:35:16.694
I know, it has been terrible.

457
00:35:16.862 --> 00:35:19.030
But it's not your fault.

458
00:35:19.198 --> 00:35:22.617
And now that all the decay is over with,
things are going to get better.


459
00:35:23.244 --> 00:35:26.996
- You understand?
- Yes, yes.


460
00:35:29.083 --> 00:35:32.377
- Well, I have to go now.
- Of course, of course you do.


461
00:35:32.545 --> 00:35:36.506
- I'll stay here and pray.
- See, now, that's always a good idea.


462
00:35:36.715 --> 00:35:38.049
Yeah.

463
00:35:38.592 --> 00:35:40.051
How do I leave this place?

464
00:35:40.719 --> 00:35:42.429
Uh, the front door is open.

465
00:35:43.889 --> 00:35:45.765
Will you be back?

466
00:35:46.559 --> 00:35:47.892
I promise.

467
00:36:25.764 --> 00:36:27.182
What?

468
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:28.975
What is it?

469
00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.602
The sky.

470
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:35.064
- The sky? Where?
- Up there.


471
00:36:35.608 --> 00:36:38.109
- I don't see anything.
- Just look.


472
00:36:38.319 --> 00:36:40.278
What is it?

473
00:36:40.446 --> 00:36:43.198
He says he sees something.

474
00:36:46.952 --> 00:36:48.369
- What is it?
- The sky.


475
00:36:48.579 --> 00:36:49.621
I see it, Mommy.

476
00:36:49.788 --> 00:36:53.458
I have never in my life
seen anything like it before.


477
00:36:54.168 --> 00:36:56.294
Or like you.

478
00:37:03.177 --> 00:37:04.469
What are you looking at?

479
00:37:04.637 --> 00:37:07.972
Oh, my lucky stars, a Negro.

480
00:37:08.182 --> 00:37:10.391
- Say what?
- How do you do, ma'am?


481
00:37:10.601 --> 00:37:12.227
I do all right.

482
00:37:12.436 --> 00:37:16.523
- Ha, ha. Good.
- Okay?


483
00:37:18.359 --> 00:37:20.527
What is it? What do you see?

484
00:37:20.694 --> 00:37:23.404
Oh, we were just looking at the...

485
00:37:23.572 --> 00:37:25.114
- Oh, no!
- What?


486
00:37:25.282 --> 00:37:28.493
Poisonous gas! Run for your life!
Run! Run! Run for your life!


487
00:37:28.661 --> 00:37:31.829
Invisible poisonous gas!

488
00:37:36.252 --> 00:37:37.752
- You know...
- Aah!


489
00:37:40.214 --> 00:37:42.257
I just wanna say...

490
00:37:42.925 --> 00:37:45.176
I think he's gonna be fine.

491
00:37:46.011 --> 00:37:49.097
Thank you, Calvin. 
Thank you very much.

492
00:37:49.265 --> 00:37:50.557
He's smart.

493
00:37:50.724 --> 00:37:53.017
Yes, dear, I know.

494
00:37:53.561 --> 00:37:56.354
But he's still such a baby.

495
00:37:56.522 --> 00:37:59.190
He's a man.

496
00:37:59.358 --> 00:38:01.109
He's a baby man.

497
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:06.864
I tried to give the driver this,
but he wouldn't take it.


498
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:10.034
Seems kind of angry.

499
00:38:10.536 --> 00:38:11.995
Lot of people do.

500
00:38:12.162 --> 00:38:15.248
Oh, boy. Here we go.

501
00:38:15.416 --> 00:38:18.001
Hold on, everyone. Hold on.

502
00:38:18.168 --> 00:38:20.211
Wow. Ha-ha-ha.

503
00:38:20.379 --> 00:38:22.505
So this is public transportation.

504
00:38:22.673 --> 00:38:26.175
My father says it becomes more and
more important because of pollution...


505
00:38:26.343 --> 00:38:30.513
which is more and more carbon dioxide
and other hazardous gases in the air.


506
00:38:31.765 --> 00:38:33.558
Do you have a gun, by the way?

507
00:38:36.562 --> 00:38:39.689
Oh. Well, thank you
for not waving it around.


508
00:38:39.857 --> 00:38:42.567
And for not vomiting, for that matter.

509
00:38:42.776 --> 00:38:45.903
Say, do you know
where I could find a grocery store?


510
00:38:46.322 --> 00:38:47.363
I have to find that.

511
00:38:47.531 --> 00:38:49.741
That and a hardware store
and a liquor store...


512
00:38:49.908 --> 00:38:52.410
- ...and a standing Holiday Inn.
- Uh... Uh...


513
00:38:52.578 --> 00:38:55.413
- ...there's a grocery store up the street.
- Where? Where?


514
00:38:55.581 --> 00:38:57.040
- Up there.
- Oh, thank you.


515
00:38:57.207 --> 00:39:00.877
Driver, please stop the bus immediately.
I wish to get off.


516
00:39:01.086 --> 00:39:03.880
- Please stop the bus, sir.
- Stop the bus!


517
00:39:07.635 --> 00:39:10.094
- Paper or plastic?
- Paper, please.


518
00:39:10.304 --> 00:39:11.929
Do you have a club card?

519
00:39:13.557 --> 00:39:14.599
Here you go.

520
00:39:14.767 --> 00:39:17.018
I need a price check on Register 4...

521
00:39:17.186 --> 00:39:18.853
Diet Dr Pepper six-pack.

522
00:39:22.816 --> 00:39:24.734
- Ah-ha!
- Ha.


523
00:39:28.781 --> 00:39:32.116
A manager to the front,
check approval, Register 1.


524
00:39:32.326 --> 00:39:33.368
Can I help you?

525
00:39:33.535 --> 00:39:36.788
Oh, yes. Uh, I'd like to get
some all-beef patties.


526
00:39:36.955 --> 00:39:38.122
Fresh or frozen?

527
00:39:39.083 --> 00:39:43.378
Come on. Frozen. 
How much are they?

528
00:39:43.629 --> 00:39:46.297
Frozen they're 6.30 a dozen
in a 3-pound box.


529
00:39:46.465 --> 00:39:48.758
Twelve into 900 is 75.

530
00:39:48.967 --> 00:39:52.387
That's almost $500
just for the hamburger.


531
00:39:52.554 --> 00:39:55.139
My mother only gave me $3000
for everything.


532
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:57.225
The yacht batteries, the pipe tobacco...

533
00:39:57.393 --> 00:40:00.561
the diesel oil, the bleach,
the floss, the birthday candles....


534
00:40:00.729 --> 00:40:03.815
You could get a meat order that big
delivered to your home.


535
00:40:03.982 --> 00:40:05.900
- Really?
- Sure.


536
00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:08.653
Oh, well, that's terrific. Heh.

537
00:40:09.613 --> 00:40:12.865
Except it just occurred to me
that I don't know where home is.


538
00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.285
I'm lost.

539
00:40:16.453 --> 00:40:18.621
- Do you know where I live?
- No.


540
00:40:18.831 --> 00:40:21.249
- Will you please excuse me?
- Gladly.


541
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.584
Thank you.

542
00:40:48.026 --> 00:40:51.279
Driver, please stop the bus.

543
00:41:19.725 --> 00:41:22.059
- Hello.
- Hi.


544
00:41:22.227 --> 00:41:25.897
The name's Adam Webber,
and I see that you buy baseball cards.


545
00:41:26.064 --> 00:41:28.691
Although these are older
than the ones in the window...


546
00:41:28.859 --> 00:41:30.860
I was hoping
that you still might be interested.


547
00:41:31.028 --> 00:41:33.196
Uh... Oh, ahem.

548
00:41:33.363 --> 00:41:35.990
How much you want for this
Mickey Mantle rookie season?


549
00:41:36.158 --> 00:41:38.493
Well, I was hoping
to sell all of the cards.


550
00:41:38.702 --> 00:41:40.703
Really? No kidding?

551
00:41:40.871 --> 00:41:43.915
All I have are hundred-dollar bills.
I need something smaller.


552
00:41:44.082 --> 00:41:46.667
- You know, ones, tens, fives.
- I see what you mean.


553
00:41:46.835 --> 00:41:48.085
I'll tell you what.

554
00:41:48.253 --> 00:41:52.924
How about I give you $500
in small bills for the whole box?


555
00:41:54.593 --> 00:41:57.345
- That would be wonderful.
- Ah, shit.


556
00:41:59.431 --> 00:42:01.766
I'm working here, Evie-poo,
don't screw me up.


557
00:42:01.975 --> 00:42:05.186
Yeah, I can see you're working,
all right.


558
00:42:08.273 --> 00:42:09.690
Oh, you're French?

559
00:42:10.484 --> 00:42:14.445
No. I'm from out of town.
I'm here on business.


560
00:42:14.613 --> 00:42:16.906
Your business must not
be sports memorabilia...


561
00:42:17.074 --> 00:42:19.116
because this one Mantle card right here?

562
00:42:19.284 --> 00:42:22.453
Worth $6000 all by its itty-bitty self.

563
00:42:22.621 --> 00:42:25.581
- Get out of here.
- No, you get out of here.


564
00:42:25.791 --> 00:42:28.376
Terrific. You're fired,
you know that, huh?


565
00:42:28.585 --> 00:42:31.087
- I quit.
- No, no, no, I fired you.


566
00:42:31.296 --> 00:42:33.798
Just like the hair-salon guy
and the Chevy dealer.


567
00:42:34.049 --> 00:42:36.634
You know why
you can't keep a goddamn job?


568
00:42:36.802 --> 00:42:39.428
Because you can't keep
your goddamn mouth shut.


569
00:42:39.638 --> 00:42:41.639
Excuse me,
but I'd really appreciate it...


570
00:42:41.807 --> 00:42:44.392
if you wouldn't take
the Lord's name in vain again.


571
00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.561
You got a problem with that, partner?

572
00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:50.064
Yes, I have a big problem with that.

573
00:42:51.108 --> 00:42:53.818
Come on, Heathcliff. 
I'll walk you out.

574
00:42:54.945 --> 00:42:57.822
Yes, ma'am, but my name's Adam.

575
00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:00.825
Ha! Adam and Eve, the perfect match.

576
00:43:00.993 --> 00:43:03.327
I hope the two of you
will be very happy together.


577
00:43:03.537 --> 00:43:04.829
Mazel-fucking-tov.

578
00:43:05.038 --> 00:43:07.123
And don't come back, neither,
Miss Big-Shot.


579
00:43:07.291 --> 00:43:09.959
I'm serious,
you're finished in the hobby business.


580
00:43:10.168 --> 00:43:13.004
- So where are we going?
- We? I'm going home.


581
00:43:13.171 --> 00:43:16.132
Judging by that coat, you have to
get back to barber college.


582
00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:17.508
No, I'm lost.

583
00:43:17.676 --> 00:43:19.635
- Ugh. You're lost?
- Uh-huh.


584
00:43:19.803 --> 00:43:22.680
Say, did you just lose your job
back there because of me?


585
00:43:22.848 --> 00:43:25.683
Oh, forget about it.
I'm sick of working for that dickhead.


586
00:43:25.851 --> 00:43:27.018
- Dickhead?
- Yes.


587
00:43:27.185 --> 00:43:29.812
A walking penis
capable of intelligent speech.


588
00:43:30.022 --> 00:43:31.647
A dickhead.

589
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:35.026
- What is wrong with you?
- I just had this mental picture...


590
00:43:35.193 --> 00:43:37.612
Here, help me pick these up.

591
00:43:37.779 --> 00:43:40.656
Oh, thank you.

592
00:43:41.491 --> 00:43:44.619
- Where are you parked?
- I came on a bus.


593
00:43:44.786 --> 00:43:46.203
Why does that not surprise me?

594
00:43:46.371 --> 00:43:48.372
I don't know,
why doesn't it surprise you?


595
00:43:48.624 --> 00:43:51.042
Well, I guess because
I'm a little psychic.


596
00:43:51.209 --> 00:43:54.378
- I have this thing.
- Oh, that's nice.


597
00:43:54.588 --> 00:43:58.382
Yeah. Let me guess something.
This is your first visit to la-la land.


598
00:43:58.592 --> 00:44:01.052
You're staying in Hollywood
because like an idiot...


599
00:44:01.219 --> 00:44:03.971
you thought that would be exciting.
Am I right so far?


600
00:44:04.139 --> 00:44:06.140
- So far.
- Yes, I'm right?


601
00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:07.683
- Right.
- I knew it.


602
00:44:07.851 --> 00:44:09.894
You get on a bus,
and before you know it...


603
00:44:10.062 --> 00:44:13.022
you're stuck in the
San Fernando Valley without a clue.


604
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:15.232
- Correct again?
- Again.


605
00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.860
Where are you staying?

606
00:44:18.236 --> 00:44:19.528
The Holiday Inn.

607
00:44:19.696 --> 00:44:23.199
Whoa. Yes, yes, the Holiday Inn,
that's exactly right.


608
00:44:23.367 --> 00:44:26.744
See? I'm psychic. I mean,
not completely, but pretty much.


609
00:44:26.912 --> 00:44:30.498
- Pretty good, huh?
- No, it was amazing.


610
00:44:30.666 --> 00:44:32.041
Yeah, I know. Thanks.

611
00:44:32.209 --> 00:44:34.168
Anyhow, I'm gonna predict a bus for you.

612
00:44:34.336 --> 00:44:36.087
- You go down here...
- Do you own a car?


613
00:44:36.254 --> 00:44:39.006
Oh, no, sweetie.
Rule number one in North America:


614
00:44:39.174 --> 00:44:40.841
No strangers in the car.

615
00:44:41.009 --> 00:44:44.136
Well, if it'll make you feel any better,
I don't have a gun.


616
00:44:44.638 --> 00:44:45.680
Oh.

617
00:44:45.847 --> 00:44:49.183
Well, that changes everything.
Get away from me.


618
00:44:49.393 --> 00:44:51.394
Oh, no.
I'm sorry, I said something wrong.


619
00:44:51.561 --> 00:44:52.728
Please forgive me.

620
00:44:52.896 --> 00:44:54.855
- Get away from me.
- I'll make you a deal.


621
00:44:55.023 --> 00:44:58.150
I will give you a Rogers Hornsby
if you take me to the hotel.


622
00:45:00.696 --> 00:45:02.029
Rogers Hornsby?

623
00:45:02.614 --> 00:45:04.907
He's yours. I was holding him back.

624
00:45:05.117 --> 00:45:09.370
- Rogers Hornsby's worth like $4000.
- So what? I got two of them.


625
00:45:09.538 --> 00:45:14.709
And this many
Larry "Yogi" Berras and... And, uh....


626
00:45:14.918 --> 00:45:18.295
So for $4000, all I have to do
is drive you to your hotel?


627
00:45:18.463 --> 00:45:20.047
- Uh-huh. Yes.
- That's it?


628
00:45:20.215 --> 00:45:22.258
I don't have to take a physical
on your spaceship?


629
00:45:22.426 --> 00:45:25.136
No, ma'am. What?

630
00:45:32.436 --> 00:45:35.104
So, Mr. Andretti,
your first time on the freeway?


631
00:45:35.313 --> 00:45:37.314
It's Webber. Adam Webber.

632
00:45:37.482 --> 00:45:40.317
Mind if I change the station?
Better traffic reports on a.m.


633
00:45:40.485 --> 00:45:41.944
Sure.

634
00:45:42.112 --> 00:45:44.405
- Wait.
- What? What is it?


635
00:45:44.573 --> 00:45:46.574
Go back. You had him, it's Perry.

636
00:45:47.117 --> 00:45:49.243
- Perry?
- Perry Como.


637
00:45:49.411 --> 00:45:52.121
Go back, you had him. 
Go back, go back.

638
00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:55.666
- Back, back.
- Okay, okay.


639
00:45:55.834 --> 00:45:58.377
- That's it.
- There.


640
00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:05.009
I could die right now.

641
00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:08.512
- Over this?
- Yeah.


642
00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:12.349
Happy sound
As it goes along the ground


643
00:46:12.517 --> 00:46:14.185
Listen to this part.

644
00:46:14.352 --> 00:46:17.521
This is where it really takes off.
Wait for it.


645
00:46:17.731 --> 00:46:19.273
There.

646
00:46:19.441 --> 00:46:21.650
You'll hold her round, round, round

647
00:46:21.818 --> 00:46:24.862
You are one scary son of a gun.

648
00:46:26.198 --> 00:46:29.825
And your head
Goes spinning round, round, round


649
00:46:29.993 --> 00:46:32.953
'Cause you found
What you've been dreamin' of


650
00:46:38.376 --> 00:46:39.752
You better slow down.

651
00:46:39.961 --> 00:46:42.505
I can't help it.
Perry Como always does this to me.


652
00:46:42.672 --> 00:46:45.257
I just get so cranked.

653
00:46:46.218 --> 00:46:49.845
Makes a girl and boy wanna say

654
00:46:50.013 --> 00:46:52.098
- Find the ring
- Find the ring


655
00:46:52.265 --> 00:46:54.350
And put it round, round, round

656
00:46:57.896 --> 00:47:01.732
- Card, please, end of service.
- That was wonderful.


657
00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:04.401
I've never felt anything
like that before in my life.


658
00:47:04.569 --> 00:47:07.321
Yeah, same here.
Don't forget your suitcase.


659
00:47:08.824 --> 00:47:10.241
- Right.
- You know, Eve....


660
00:47:15.705 --> 00:47:17.206
Hello.

661
00:47:17.374 --> 00:47:19.708
- Hi.
- I would like to stay at this hotel.


662
00:47:19.918 --> 00:47:22.670
Fill this out, please,
and I'll need to see a card.


663
00:47:24.047 --> 00:47:26.757
- A card?
- Yes, sir.


664
00:47:27.384 --> 00:47:30.386
Oh, of course.

665
00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:40.104
Okay, then. Ugh.

666
00:47:40.272 --> 00:47:44.024
Bathroom's there,
TV's there, remote is on top.


667
00:47:44.192 --> 00:47:46.819
Room-service menu on the table.

668
00:47:47.821 --> 00:47:49.530
Wow.

669
00:48:00.292 --> 00:48:02.042
Oh, you, uh, dial nine to get out.

670
00:48:03.962 --> 00:48:05.087
Of what?

671
00:48:06.756 --> 00:48:08.215
The hotel.

672
00:48:09.926 --> 00:48:11.552
I see.

673
00:48:13.889 --> 00:48:16.473
Well, thank you.
You've been very, very helpful.


674
00:48:16.641 --> 00:48:18.809
I managed to get some change
downstairs...


675
00:48:18.977 --> 00:48:21.645
and my father taught me
in situations such as this...


676
00:48:21.813 --> 00:48:24.106
it's customary to give a tip.

677
00:48:24.274 --> 00:48:28.861
- Well, your father's a smart guy.
- My father's a genius.


678
00:48:30.864 --> 00:48:31.989
Okay.

679
00:48:32.157 --> 00:48:35.492
All right, well, uh, here's your key,
and good night, sir.


680
00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:37.328
Thank you. Good night, sleep tight.

681
00:48:37.495 --> 00:48:40.497
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
That's what my mom always says.


682
00:48:40.665 --> 00:48:43.459
Who I'm really beginning to miss,
by the way.


683
00:48:43.877 --> 00:48:46.921
I'm sorry.
It's my first night away from home.


684
00:48:48.256 --> 00:48:49.340
How old are you?

685
00:48:50.508 --> 00:48:52.259
Thirty-five.

686
00:48:52.844 --> 00:48:55.804
- You don't look 35.
- How old do I look?


687
00:48:55.972 --> 00:49:00.100
- Oh, 25, around there.
- Hmm.


688
00:49:00.393 --> 00:49:03.437
I guess living up here
makes people look older.


689
00:49:04.105 --> 00:49:05.940
Up here on the 18th floor?

690
00:49:06.942 --> 00:49:10.694
Yes, up here on the 18th floor.
Good night.


691
00:49:24.209 --> 00:49:25.626
Yes, you're absolutely right.

692
00:49:25.794 --> 00:49:27.711
What in the hell am I doing here?

693
00:49:27.879 --> 00:49:31.215
That's what I'd like to know.
Somebody tell me that.


694
00:49:31.925 --> 00:49:38.430
Natural oils, tropical fruits,
flora, nuts, and protective sunscreens.


695
00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:41.392
A complete sun-care line
created by one man...


696
00:49:43.728 --> 00:49:45.854
for one reason...

697
00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:49.733
Yes?

698
00:49:49.901 --> 00:49:52.403
Hi. This is the woman
from the baseball card store.


699
00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:54.655
- Remember me?
- Oh, yes.


700
00:49:54.823 --> 00:49:58.993
Hi. Hello. Hot diggity dog.

701
00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.995
Thanks for calling me on the telephone.

702
00:50:07.919 --> 00:50:11.255
Ha. I'm so glad to see you.
I thought I'd never see you again.


703
00:50:11.464 --> 00:50:13.090
Yeah, okay, okay. Down, boy.

704
00:50:13.258 --> 00:50:16.260
Listen, I can't take this
for driving you home.


705
00:50:16.428 --> 00:50:17.970
I wish I could, but I can't.

706
00:50:18.138 --> 00:50:20.097
- So here, take it back.
- Uh-uh.


707
00:50:20.765 --> 00:50:23.517
I would've left it at the front desk,
but it's valuable.


708
00:50:23.727 --> 00:50:26.103
- I can't take that, it's yours.
- Take it, damn it.


709
00:50:26.271 --> 00:50:27.563
Okay.

710
00:50:27.772 --> 00:50:31.233
- Why are you doing that?
- Because I haven't brushed yet.


711
00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:36.447
Oh, okay.
Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.


712
00:50:36.614 --> 00:50:41.035
- Wait. Eve, please wait.
- Please, do not follow me. Don't do it.


713
00:50:41.202 --> 00:50:43.787
Oh, I knew this would happen.
You're like a lost puppy.


714
00:50:43.997 --> 00:50:45.748
Can't you talk to me for one second?

715
00:50:45.915 --> 00:50:49.084
- Just one little second, please?
- Okay.


716
00:50:49.252 --> 00:50:51.462
Damn. I should've
taken the money and run.


717
00:50:51.629 --> 00:50:55.007
That's what Troy told me to do,
but did I listen? No.


718
00:50:55.216 --> 00:50:56.592
Will you put your hand down?

719
00:50:58.219 --> 00:51:00.888
Who's Troy? Is he your husband?

720
00:51:01.097 --> 00:51:03.390
- Or a boyfriend?
- No.


721
00:51:04.017 --> 00:51:07.978
- Thank you!
- Stop that, don't do that.


722
00:51:08.146 --> 00:51:11.774
Listen, I know you like me, okay?
I can tell.


723
00:51:11.941 --> 00:51:14.985
But you know what?
A lot of guys like me.


724
00:51:15.153 --> 00:51:16.320
Not me exactly.

725
00:51:16.488 --> 00:51:19.907
More like my legs, my butt or my hair
or some combination of the above.


726
00:51:20.075 --> 00:51:21.492
I think it's the eyes.

727
00:51:22.285 --> 00:51:23.786
The eyes?

728
00:51:23.953 --> 00:51:27.164
Great, an eye man.
Anyhow, it never works out, okay?


729
00:51:27.332 --> 00:51:29.333
Not that you even need to know that.

730
00:51:29.501 --> 00:51:32.086
You look like crap.
What have you been doing?


731
00:51:32.253 --> 00:51:34.963
Watching television in color.

732
00:51:36.341 --> 00:51:38.300
In color? No kidding.

733
00:51:38.468 --> 00:51:43.263
- Mm-hm. Cross my heart, hope to die.
- Yeah. See you.


734
00:51:43.431 --> 00:51:45.808
- Why doesn't it ever work out?
- What?


735
00:51:45.975 --> 00:51:47.976
Why doesn't it ever work out,
you and men?


736
00:51:48.144 --> 00:51:50.687
Why? Who the hell knows?

737
00:51:50.855 --> 00:51:53.357
If you promise to leave me alone,
I'll tell you why.


738
00:51:53.566 --> 00:51:54.650
Okay.

739
00:51:54.818 --> 00:51:59.196
It never works out because I am into legs
and hair and butts myself, that's why.


740
00:51:59.364 --> 00:52:01.490
I wind up with guys
who are good-looking...


741
00:52:01.658 --> 00:52:04.535
but even more shallow than I am,
if you can picture that.


742
00:52:04.702 --> 00:52:07.287
Excuse me, I have to go find
another low-paying job...


743
00:52:07.455 --> 00:52:10.958
where some guy named Jerry keeps
telling me how lousy his marriage is.


744
00:52:11.126 --> 00:52:13.001
- Why not go to work for me?
- Doing what?


745
00:52:13.169 --> 00:52:15.129
Helping me sell all my baseball cards...

746
00:52:15.296 --> 00:52:18.298
and buying enough food and supplies
to fill several trucks.


747
00:52:18.466 --> 00:52:21.176
Food and supplies?
Who for, like, starving people?


748
00:52:21.344 --> 00:52:24.847
Oh, well, they're not starving yet,
but they do need help.


749
00:52:25.056 --> 00:52:28.392
- Well, how long would you need me for?
- Two weeks.


750
00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.811
- What's the pay?
- What's fair?


751
00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:34.189
Well, I gotta make at least
a thousand dollars a week.


752
00:52:39.696 --> 00:52:40.988
You got it.

753
00:52:41.156 --> 00:52:43.407
- Wait here while I get changed.
- Sure.


754
00:52:46.828 --> 00:52:48.328
Sure.

755
00:52:54.419 --> 00:52:56.211
There you go.

756
00:52:56.421 --> 00:53:01.175
Why would someone need

757
00:53:01.342 --> 00:53:03.760
I don't know, I
just work for the guy.

758
00:53:03.928 --> 00:53:06.263
And who does he work for, the CIA?

759
00:53:06.431 --> 00:53:08.682
Pipe tobacco. Ha-ha-ha.

760
00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:11.018
I'm gonna need all of this.

761
00:53:13.771 --> 00:53:15.606
Toilet paper.

762
00:53:17.775 --> 00:53:19.735
Is there a sale?

763
00:53:35.168 --> 00:53:38.462
Well, another day, another dollar.

764
00:53:44.552 --> 00:53:47.554
- Will you stop staring at me?
- Sorry.


765
00:53:48.056 --> 00:53:51.141
- I'll pick you up at 8 in the morning.
- Oh.


766
00:53:53.811 --> 00:53:56.980
- You know, Eve, I was thinking...
- Night.


767
00:53:57.315 --> 00:53:59.066
Night.

768
00:54:16.709 --> 00:54:20.170
We'll need to rent a refrigerated truck
for the beef and poultry.


769
00:54:20.338 --> 00:54:24.633
Well, it's your life.
And by the way, it's a dandy.


770
00:54:27.178 --> 00:54:29.638
Think we're also gonna have to get
another locker.


771
00:54:29.806 --> 00:54:32.683
It's no problem.
We'll just sell another baseball card.


772
00:54:34.477 --> 00:54:37.020
- Coming down.
- Okay.


773
00:54:40.692 --> 00:54:43.902
Ah, whoo. Ha-ha-ha.

774
00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:47.531
You know, Eve...

775
00:54:47.699 --> 00:54:50.284
And don't get mad, okay?

776
00:54:50.994 --> 00:54:54.037
But I would just be lost without you.

777
00:54:57.292 --> 00:54:58.625
Thanks.

778
00:54:59.711 --> 00:55:02.337
Ha-ha-ha. And I guess, uh....

779
00:55:03.006 --> 00:55:04.673
I guess that....

780
00:55:04.841 --> 00:55:07.968
- I think that you and I...
- Adam, don't even think about it, okay?


781
00:55:08.136 --> 00:55:10.262
I'm sorry, I know that sounds mean...

782
00:55:10.471 --> 00:55:13.265
but believe me, it'd be a lot meaner
if I didn't say it, okay?


783
00:55:13.433 --> 00:55:14.558
- Mm-hm.
- Okay?


784
00:55:14.726 --> 00:55:16.476
- Okay.
- Let's take this truck back...


785
00:55:16.644 --> 00:55:18.312
and I'm hungry.

786
00:55:21.524 --> 00:55:22.649
Are you getting in?

787
00:55:27.905 --> 00:55:29.865
There's something else
I'd like help with.


788
00:55:30.033 --> 00:55:31.074
Name it.

789
00:55:31.284 --> 00:55:33.910
I'm afraid this is gonna sound
a little bit crazy.


790
00:55:34.078 --> 00:55:37.039
- Heh. I'm sure it will.
- Then forget it.


791
00:55:37.248 --> 00:55:39.708
No, no. I'm sorry.

792
00:55:39.876 --> 00:55:41.001
What is it?

793
00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:46.089
Eve, I want you to
help me find a wife.

794
00:55:46.341 --> 00:55:48.425
- A wife?
- Yes.


795
00:55:48.593 --> 00:55:51.845
- What for?
- Because I want to get married.


796
00:55:52.013 --> 00:55:53.430
Why?

797
00:55:53.598 --> 00:55:55.223
Because I don't want to be alone.

798
00:55:55.391 --> 00:55:59.770
Well, you can be single and not alone.
Marriage bites.


799
00:55:59.937 --> 00:56:01.938
- Bites what?
- The big one.


800
00:56:02.106 --> 00:56:04.691
- It does?
- Sure.


801
00:56:04.859 --> 00:56:08.236
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- Everybody knows that.


802
00:56:08.404 --> 00:56:12.449
Ask my divorced brothers
or my divorced mom and dad.


803
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:14.576
Everybody knows that.

804
00:56:14.786 --> 00:56:18.038
- They're all divorced?
- Everybody's divorced.


805
00:56:19.832 --> 00:56:21.166
Wow.

806
00:56:22.752 --> 00:56:25.629
- What kind of wife you looking for?
- Hmm? Oh, um....


807
00:56:25.797 --> 00:56:29.049
Well, one who's not a mutant.

808
00:56:29.217 --> 00:56:32.886
Heh. No dogs, huh? Okay, cool.

809
00:56:34.222 --> 00:56:35.472
And if it's possible...

810
00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:38.141
I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.

811
00:56:43.606 --> 00:56:46.108
Um, when do you need her by?

812
00:56:47.985 --> 00:56:49.111
Two weeks?

813
00:56:49.821 --> 00:56:51.863
I can probably get you laid
in two weeks...


814
00:56:52.073 --> 00:56:57.953
but to locate a non-mutant wife
from Pasadena could take some time.


815
00:56:58.579 --> 00:57:00.872
That's what I was afraid of.

816
00:57:06.129 --> 00:57:08.588
What do you mean,
you can get me laid?

817
00:57:10.967 --> 00:57:13.593
- Uh, can we talk about that a little later?
- Of course.


818
00:57:13.761 --> 00:57:15.095
Great.

819
00:57:16.973 --> 00:57:19.433
Lord, bless this food
we are about to receive...


820
00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.644
and make us ever mindful
of the needs of others.


821
00:57:22.854 --> 00:57:25.188
And bless my mom and bless my dad...

822
00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:27.524
and bless my new friend Eve.

823
00:57:27.692 --> 00:57:29.359
Amen.

824
00:57:29.527 --> 00:57:31.445
Amen.

825
00:57:39.412 --> 00:57:41.204
- Get out.
- The engine is still running.


826
00:57:41.414 --> 00:57:43.039
Now. Get out.

827
00:57:43.207 --> 00:57:44.875
- Yes, ma'am.
- Stop the "ma'am" crap.


828
00:57:45.042 --> 00:57:46.543
I'm sorry.

829
00:57:47.170 --> 00:57:48.712
You almost got us killed.

830
00:57:48.963 --> 00:57:52.215
- I told you, I've never driven before.
- Well, never drive again.


831
00:57:52.467 --> 00:57:56.678
- You said it would be easy.
- Well, I was wrong.


832
00:57:56.846 --> 00:57:58.889
- Say, is this your house?
- Yes.


833
00:57:59.056 --> 00:58:02.017
- I like it.
- What are you bitching about now?


834
00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:05.729
- What are you doing here?
- I forgot some of my stuff.


835
00:58:05.938 --> 00:58:07.481
- Your stuff?
- Yeah.


836
00:58:07.648 --> 00:58:09.566
Let me see that.

837
00:58:09.734 --> 00:58:11.568
Oh, you came back for your underwear.

838
00:58:11.736 --> 00:58:14.821
Excuse me, these are Ralph Laurens.

839
00:58:14.989 --> 00:58:17.032
How did you get in?

840
00:58:17.658 --> 00:58:19.409
Thanks.

841
00:58:19.577 --> 00:58:22.162
And who's this
interesting-looking fellow?


842
00:58:22.371 --> 00:58:26.208
- This is Adam. Adam, this is Cliff.
- How do you do?


843
00:58:26.375 --> 00:58:28.168
I do fine, Adam.

844
00:58:28.377 --> 00:58:32.214
How about yourself?
You, uh, doing any good lately?


845
00:58:32.423 --> 00:58:34.424
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.

846
00:58:34.592 --> 00:58:36.343
Sheena Gilroy's apartment.

847
00:58:36.511 --> 00:58:39.846
You remember her.
She's the, uh, model who went to Harvard.


848
00:58:40.973 --> 00:58:42.015
Hmm.

849
00:58:42.183 --> 00:58:45.352
Well, I'd better be going. Bye, Adam.

850
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.229
- Nice coat.
- Thank you, Cliff.


851
00:58:47.396 --> 00:58:51.441
- It was very nice to meet you.
- That's a nice parking job too.


852
00:58:51.609 --> 00:58:54.110
- May I ask you a question?
- He's a former boyfriend.


853
00:58:54.278 --> 00:58:58.198
We lived together for about six months,
and I still have sort of a thing for him.


854
00:58:58.366 --> 00:59:00.283
That's what you wanted to know,
isn't it?


855
00:59:00.493 --> 00:59:01.952
No, I was gonna ask you...

856
00:59:02.119 --> 00:59:04.788
why Cliff likes to wear
another man's underpants.


857
00:59:04.997 --> 00:59:06.122
What?

858
00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:16.675
Rhinoceros

859
00:59:18.803 --> 00:59:20.387
Rhinoceros

860
00:59:20.555 --> 00:59:23.557
This guy is unbelievable.

861
00:59:23.724 --> 00:59:24.766
I knew you'd like him.

862
00:59:24.934 --> 00:59:27.310
I know. It's like he's
from X-Files or something.


863
00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:30.146
He's got all these
easily negotiable properties, right?


864
00:59:30.314 --> 00:59:32.148
He's obviously setting up something big.

865
00:59:32.316 --> 00:59:34.651
Maybe a self-sustaining island
off South America.


866
00:59:34.819 --> 00:59:39.447
Maybe he's the leader of some cult into
practices involving poultry and tobacco.


867
00:59:40.908 --> 00:59:43.869
You just wake up

868
00:59:45.037 --> 00:59:46.079
Rhinoceros

869
00:59:46.247 --> 00:59:49.833
- You have very nice ceilings.
- Do I?


870
00:59:50.501 --> 00:59:54.296
Well, you like ceilings?

871
00:59:54.463 --> 00:59:56.423
Not particularly.

872
00:59:57.008 --> 01:00:01.136
Ah. Well, I hope you like this.
It's sea urchin wrapped in seaweed, or nori.


873
01:00:01.304 --> 01:00:02.345
I love sushi.

874
01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:07.183
- I love Lucy.
- Who doesn't? She's hilarious.


875
01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:11.563
- Here you go, one champagne cocktail.
- Oh, thank you.


876
01:00:11.772 --> 01:00:13.815
I thought only hookers
drank those things.


877
01:00:14.025 --> 01:00:16.192
Well, I know Mom sure likes them.

878
01:00:20.698 --> 01:00:23.241
Well, dinner's in 15.
Why don't we sit down and chat?


879
01:00:23.409 --> 01:00:24.743
Mm-hm.

880
01:00:24.911 --> 01:00:29.164
- So, Troy, what do you do for a living?
- Oh, I design websites.


881
01:00:29.332 --> 01:00:30.916
Mm.

882
01:00:31.083 --> 01:00:32.959
And, Adam...

883
01:00:33.127 --> 01:00:34.711
where on earth are you from?

884
01:00:34.879 --> 01:00:38.381
- Out of town. That's all he'll say.
- Mm-hm. It's a very small place.


885
01:00:38.633 --> 01:00:42.218
- People don't even know it's there.
- And it's called?


886
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:44.554
Maybe Eve can guess.

887
01:00:44.722 --> 01:00:46.890
- She's psychic.
- Is she?


888
01:00:47.391 --> 01:00:51.186
- Since when?
- Since I got rear-ended in Palm Springs.


889
01:00:51.395 --> 01:00:54.898
Well, then, Miss Dionne Warwick,
tell us what town he's from.


890
01:00:55.107 --> 01:00:57.317
All right. Give me your hand.

891
01:00:58.736 --> 01:01:00.904
Oh, Lord.

892
01:01:01.072 --> 01:01:02.656
Okay.

893
01:01:02.823 --> 01:01:04.240
I'm not promising anything.

894
01:01:06.869 --> 01:01:09.120
- Are you okay?
- Hmm? Mm.


895
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:14.834
I see snow.

896
01:01:16.003 --> 01:01:18.129
Lots of snow.

897
01:01:18.339 --> 01:01:20.215
Way up north.

898
01:01:20.383 --> 01:01:22.008
Are we getting hot?

899
01:01:22.885 --> 01:01:24.594
Yes.

900
01:01:26.722 --> 01:01:28.598
You live in Alaska...

901
01:01:28.766 --> 01:01:31.726
and the only way in and out
of your place is by plane.


902
01:01:32.770 --> 01:01:35.730
And, uh, you definitely came here
for food and supplies...


903
01:01:35.898 --> 01:01:38.024
and to find a wife.

904
01:01:38.442 --> 01:01:39.943
Wow.

905
01:01:40.945 --> 01:01:44.155
- That was right?
- Got goose bumps all over me.


906
01:01:44.365 --> 01:01:45.949
I'm clairvoyant, butthead.

907
01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:49.703
Well, why wouldn't you just go to Nome
to get supplies and a wife?


908
01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:51.955
- Isn't that a lot closer?
- Yeah, right.


909
01:01:52.164 --> 01:01:55.709
That's where you'd go to find girls.
Nome.


910
01:01:55.876 --> 01:01:57.627
He's gay, by the way.

911
01:01:58.754 --> 01:02:00.588
Well, good for you.

912
01:02:01.799 --> 01:02:03.883
Well, we try.

913
01:02:04.051 --> 01:02:05.552
Can I ask you some questions?

914
01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.053
Hmm?

915
01:02:07.221 --> 01:02:10.598
- When did Alaska become a state?
- 1959.


916
01:02:10.808 --> 01:02:13.143
Okay, and, uh, who owned it
before we did?


917
01:02:13.644 --> 01:02:16.104
- Russia.
- And when did we get it from them?


918
01:02:16.313 --> 01:02:17.981
1867, Seward's Folly.

919
01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:22.444
We purchased it for $7.2 million,
a tidy sum then as well as now.


920
01:02:22.611 --> 01:02:24.696
I'm quoting my father, of course.

921
01:02:24.905 --> 01:02:27.490
- All right, what's the state capital?
- Juneau.


922
01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:30.118
Hello? It's Anchorage. Gotcha.

923
01:02:30.327 --> 01:02:33.288
Mm-mm. Sorry, that's the largest city.

924
01:02:40.004 --> 01:02:41.337
Where's he going?

925
01:02:41.505 --> 01:02:44.340
He's going to check your answers
on his computer.


926
01:02:44.508 --> 01:02:46.009
He has a computer?

927
01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.178
- Sure.
- In the house?


928
01:02:48.596 --> 01:02:50.346
No, actually, it's in the back yard.

929
01:02:50.514 --> 01:02:54.017
- Of course it's in the house. It's in there.
- May I be excused, please?


930
01:02:54.185 --> 01:02:56.811
- Yeah.
- Thank you.


931
01:03:44.944 --> 01:03:46.402
Aah!

932
01:03:47.196 --> 01:03:48.780
Who are you?

933
01:03:50.074 --> 01:03:53.409
- I'm the mother.
- It's the mother.


934
01:03:53.577 --> 01:03:56.037
It's the mother. The mother.

935
01:03:56.205 --> 01:04:01.584
The mother, the mother, the mother.

936
01:04:01.836 --> 01:04:04.337
It's the mother.

937
01:04:11.178 --> 01:04:14.681
Troy, I suppose those tall buildings
we saw this morning are new?


938
01:04:14.849 --> 01:04:17.100
Yeah. Almost all of them, anyway.

939
01:04:17.309 --> 01:04:20.603
- Recovery's impressive.
- Recovery? Oh, yeah.


940
01:04:20.813 --> 01:04:23.690
Well, you know, they rebuilt
the freeway in only six months.


941
01:04:23.858 --> 01:04:25.441
- Really?
- Uh-huh.


942
01:04:25.609 --> 01:04:27.610
That's amazing. 
I'm very impressed.

943
01:04:27.778 --> 01:04:30.113
- Oh, it was impressive.
- Are you sure I look okay?


944
01:04:30.322 --> 01:04:33.116
- Oh, trust me, you look fabulous.
- Well, thank you, Troy.


945
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:37.453
- Hey.
- Hey.


946
01:04:39.331 --> 01:04:41.624
So, what do you think?

947
01:04:42.793 --> 01:04:44.586
- It works.
- Mm-hm. I should show you...


948
01:04:44.753 --> 01:04:46.129
the entire trousseau.

949
01:04:46.297 --> 01:04:48.256
Shirts, sweaters, socks,
the whole thing.


950
01:04:48.424 --> 01:04:50.633
No. First let's show her these.

951
01:04:51.802 --> 01:04:54.262
Huh? Eve, can I skate around your block?

952
01:04:56.182 --> 01:04:59.726
How about it, Eve?
Can he skate around your block?


953
01:05:00.477 --> 01:05:01.644
No.

954
01:05:02.104 --> 01:05:06.107
- Just a few laps.
- It won't take long.


955
01:05:06.275 --> 01:05:08.109
Ha, ha. No.

956
01:05:24.668 --> 01:05:26.169
Look.

957
01:05:36.972 --> 01:05:38.932
Adam, will you go skate
on the bike path?


958
01:05:39.099 --> 01:05:42.310
- Where?
- The bike path. It's over there.


959
01:05:44.605 --> 01:05:46.397
God, I wish I could wear those pants.

960
01:06:08.295 --> 01:06:09.879
Hi.

961
01:06:59.596 --> 01:07:02.473
Yeah! Ha, ha!

962
01:07:05.561 --> 01:07:08.604
Yeah!

963
01:07:16.655 --> 01:07:18.573
Y.M.C.A.

964
01:07:18.741 --> 01:07:23.411
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

965
01:07:23.579 --> 01:07:27.248
They have everything
For you men to enjoy


966
01:07:27.416 --> 01:07:29.876
You can hang out with all the boys

967
01:07:30.044 --> 01:07:33.674
Its fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

968
01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:37.342
Its fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

969
01:07:38.802 --> 01:07:42.180
You can get yourself clean
You can have a good meal


970
01:07:42.348 --> 01:07:45.808
You can do whatever you feel

971
01:07:45.976 --> 01:07:47.810
All right, girl, hit that ball.

972
01:07:58.155 --> 01:08:01.824
I get it. I finally get it.

973
01:08:01.992 --> 01:08:04.744
You have to see it to understand it.

974
01:08:06.663 --> 01:08:09.540
Because he must.

975
01:08:19.343 --> 01:08:20.968
Haven't you heard the saying:

976
01:08:21.136 --> 01:08:23.971
"He hasn't got enough sense
to come in out of the rain"?


977
01:08:24.139 --> 01:08:25.264
Yep.

978
01:08:25.432 --> 01:08:30.186
You know, my father,
who is a scientist...


979
01:08:30.354 --> 01:08:32.855
says that everything is a miracle.

980
01:08:33.065 --> 01:08:34.982
- Yeah?
- Everything.


981
01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:38.361
Until recently,
I wasn't sure what he meant by that.


982
01:08:38.529 --> 01:08:41.864
No kidding. Listen, uh, you still
wanna go girl hunting tonight?


983
01:08:42.074 --> 01:08:45.701
- Oh, yes, I certainly do.
- Okay.


984
01:08:45.869 --> 01:08:48.704
But, you know, this whole business
of finding you a wife...


985
01:08:48.872 --> 01:08:50.123
it's pretty ridiculous.

986
01:08:50.290 --> 01:08:53.209
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.


987
01:08:53.377 --> 01:08:55.378
A girlfriend, maybe, but a wife, it's...

988
01:08:55.587 --> 01:08:58.339
Well, then help me find a girlfriend.
That's all I ask.


989
01:08:58.507 --> 01:09:01.384
I'll tell you what. I'll give you
every single card I've got.


990
01:09:01.593 --> 01:09:04.303
Screw you. You think I'm just
somebody you can buy off?


991
01:09:04.471 --> 01:09:07.890
Oh, no, Eve, I didn't mean that at all.
Eve, you're my best friend.


992
01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.561
Would you do it
because you're my very best friend?


993
01:09:14.231 --> 01:09:16.065
Yeah, okay.

994
01:09:20.404 --> 01:09:22.238
Thank you, Eve.

995
01:09:30.247 --> 01:09:33.166
Well, why did we park way back there?

996
01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:37.587
Miss Rustokov does not allow
total strangers to drive her car.


997
01:09:39.423 --> 01:09:41.257
- What?
- Ladies first, Troy.


998
01:09:41.425 --> 01:09:43.759
- That was close.
- Uh-huh.


999
01:09:44.178 --> 01:09:47.555
My goodness gracious,
this place is something.


1000
01:09:47.723 --> 01:09:51.058
- Look unimpressed.
- Yeah, bored, even.


1001
01:09:52.269 --> 01:09:54.770
Try vaguely bored.

1002
01:09:54.938 --> 01:09:58.024
Unimpressed but still interested.

1003
01:09:59.526 --> 01:10:00.943
- Not crazy.
- Do I look crazy?


1004
01:10:01.111 --> 01:10:05.072
- Yes.
- Just, uh, be loose.


1005
01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.949
- Yeah.
- Just be yourself.


1006
01:10:07.117 --> 01:10:08.618
Yeah, that's always good advice.

1007
01:10:08.785 --> 01:10:11.579
Well, for him.
It doesn't work for the rest of us.


1008
01:10:14.791 --> 01:10:18.044
Of all the clubs in all the towns
in all the world...


1009
01:10:18.212 --> 01:10:19.754
you walk into mine.

1010
01:10:19.963 --> 01:10:24.050
So welcome to Club 40's,
where the party never stops.


1011
01:10:24.218 --> 01:10:26.802
Jason, Jonathan, this is Adam.
Adam, that's them.


1012
01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:28.137
Hi, how do you do?

1013
01:10:28.305 --> 01:10:31.766
It's very nice to meet you,
Jason and Jonathan.


1014
01:10:31.934 --> 01:10:34.727
My mother said when you meet
someone for the first time...


1015
01:10:34.895 --> 01:10:36.812
it's easier to remember their names...

1016
01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:40.816
if you use those names right away,
Jason and Jonathan.


1017
01:10:41.318 --> 01:10:42.944
He's from Alaska.

1018
01:10:43.654 --> 01:10:45.154
Oh.

1019
01:10:45.948 --> 01:10:48.658
Hi there, Eve. 
Who's the hunk?

1020
01:10:48.825 --> 01:10:51.577
- Get lost, Sophie.
- Hi, I'm Sophie.


1021
01:10:51.787 --> 01:10:53.454
Hi, how do you do? 
I'm Adam Webber.

1022
01:10:53.622 --> 01:10:56.040
- Adam lives in Alaska.
- No shit?


1023
01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:02.046
Oh, you speak beautiful French.

1024
01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:21.232
Adam. Adam.

1025
01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:22.692
Yeah? Oh, um....

1026
01:11:25.862 --> 01:11:27.822
Quit showing off.
We're here on business.


1027
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:30.491
- I thought we were here to meet women.
- Not that one.


1028
01:11:30.659 --> 01:11:31.701
I like her.

1029
01:11:31.868 --> 01:11:33.995
Tell me, Sophie,
when you fly to Paris...


1030
01:11:34.162 --> 01:11:37.164
do you check these,
or are they carry-on?


1031
01:11:37.332 --> 01:11:39.834
- They're carry-on.
- Ah.


1032
01:11:41.253 --> 01:11:42.837
Excuse me.

1033
01:11:43.005 --> 01:11:45.298
But there's nothin' up my sleeve

1034
01:11:45.465 --> 01:11:49.135
But a place to play
Where the people all swing around


1035
01:11:49.303 --> 01:11:51.012
What are you drinking?

1036
01:11:51.179 --> 01:11:54.390
Oh, this is a Rob Roy.
It's a very popular drink, I'm told.


1037
01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:59.145
How about her?

1038
01:11:59.313 --> 01:12:01.689
- No way.
- No way?


1039
01:12:01.898 --> 01:12:04.233
Why not? I think she's very attractive.

1040
01:12:04.401 --> 01:12:07.570
Adam, she's got "bitch"
written all over her.


1041
01:12:07.821 --> 01:12:10.573
You do know what "bitch" means,
don't you?


1042
01:12:10.782 --> 01:12:12.742
Well, yes, I do. 
I do have a dictionary.

1043
01:12:12.909 --> 01:12:16.704
But I can't understand for the life of me
why you would say that about her...


1044
01:12:16.913 --> 01:12:19.582
or why Cliff would say that about you.

1045
01:12:21.418 --> 01:12:27.423
Okay, uh, Adam, I think for you,
we should aim for sweet.


1046
01:12:28.175 --> 01:12:29.759
Okay. I like that.

1047
01:12:29.926 --> 01:12:32.762
Yeah, sweet.
That's a lovely way of putting it.


1048
01:12:34.848 --> 01:12:37.933
There's Miss Sweet, over there
by the hors d'oeuvre table, look.


1049
01:12:38.101 --> 01:12:40.436
Oh, yeah, yeah. Could be.

1050
01:12:40.604 --> 01:12:44.565
Yeah, go on, Romeo, say hello.
She looks like a non-mutant to me.


1051
01:12:44.733 --> 01:12:46.942
Okay. All right.

1052
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:48.527
What do I say to her?

1053
01:12:48.737 --> 01:12:53.366
Oh, say something surprising,
something funny.


1054
01:12:53.533 --> 01:12:55.034
Lie if need be.

1055
01:12:55.243 --> 01:12:57.036
- Lie?
- Oh, yeah.


1056
01:12:57.204 --> 01:13:00.623
Lying can be a very effective
dating tool.


1057
01:13:02.876 --> 01:13:05.628
Okay. All right.

1058
01:13:05.879 --> 01:13:07.963
Well, here I go.

1059
01:13:10.467 --> 01:13:12.134
I don't think I wanna watch this.

1060
01:13:12.386 --> 01:13:14.053
Surprising and funny.

1061
01:13:14.221 --> 01:13:16.972
Well, I know a duck
who bought some lip balm.


1062
01:13:17.599 --> 01:13:18.974
Lie.

1063
01:13:21.144 --> 01:13:22.645
Hi.

1064
01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.148
- Yes?
- I was wondering if you could help me.


1065
01:13:26.316 --> 01:13:28.484
I, um, seem to have lost...

1066
01:13:28.652 --> 01:13:32.488
my Congressional Medal of Honor
around here somewhere.


1067
01:13:33.365 --> 01:13:35.741
Ha, ha. Now, that's a great one.

1068
01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:42.248
- This is my new friend.
- Uh, hi.


1069
01:13:42.416 --> 01:13:45.918
- Adam Webber.
- Hi, I'm Heather.


1070
01:13:46.086 --> 01:13:47.294
- Heather?
- Yeah.


1071
01:13:47.462 --> 01:13:50.172
I don't believe
I've ever heard that name before.


1072
01:13:54.928 --> 01:13:56.137
Yeah, do you dance?

1073
01:13:56.304 --> 01:13:58.681
Why, I took a dance lesson
every day of my life...


1074
01:13:58.849 --> 01:14:00.641
up until a couple of days ago.

1075
01:14:00.809 --> 01:14:02.601
- You're kidding.
- No, no, I did.


1076
01:14:04.479 --> 01:14:05.521
Shall we dance?

1077
01:14:05.689 --> 01:14:07.022
- Sure.
- Yeah?


1078
01:14:10.694 --> 01:14:13.028
Wait for me.

1079
01:14:44.394 --> 01:14:46.896
He drives a great big car
Smokes a big cigar


1080
01:14:47.063 --> 01:14:49.565
He looks like a king
And he acts like a star


1081
01:14:49.733 --> 01:14:52.276
When we see him drive by
He goes "toot, toot"


1082
01:14:52.444 --> 01:14:54.236
We all shout
Hey, Mr. Zoot Suit


1083
01:14:54.404 --> 01:14:57.156
He's got purple suspenders
And a yellow tie


1084
01:14:57.324 --> 01:15:00.201
- Say what?
- Come on, boys, I tell you no lie


1085
01:15:00.368 --> 01:15:02.244
Those hats, those funky spats

1086
01:15:02.412 --> 01:15:04.914
He's the hippest hip and the coolest cat

1087
01:15:05.081 --> 01:15:07.458
I tell you no lie
This guy can't be beat


1088
01:15:07.626 --> 01:15:09.627
Wherever he goes
He turns up the heat


1089
01:15:09.795 --> 01:15:12.505
So when you see him drive by
With that big cheroot


1090
01:15:12.672 --> 01:15:16.050
Don't forget to shout
Hey, Mr. Zoot Suit!


1091
01:15:38.657 --> 01:15:40.908
I tell you no lie
This guy can't be beat


1092
01:15:41.076 --> 01:15:43.285
Wherever he goes
He turns up the heat


1093
01:15:43.453 --> 01:15:45.955
So when you see him drive by
With that big cheroot


1094
01:15:46.122 --> 01:15:49.041
Don't forget to shout
Hey, Mr. Zoot Suit!


1095
01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.361
Oh.

1096
01:16:21.616 --> 01:16:25.578
- Is that your girlfriend?
- No, no. Will you please excuse me?


1097
01:16:25.787 --> 01:16:29.164
- What are you doing?
- You. You go to the bathroom.


1098
01:16:29.332 --> 01:16:32.167
What, right here?
Well, I thought I should check.


1099
01:16:32.335 --> 01:16:34.253
- I mean, you're being so bossy.
- Go.


1100
01:16:34.462 --> 01:16:37.047
- Thank you both for the dance.
- Thank you.


1101
01:16:42.345 --> 01:16:45.014
I have to go to the bathroom.

1102
01:16:45.765 --> 01:16:47.141
Oh.

1103
01:16:47.976 --> 01:16:51.145
- You wanted to see me?
- You're not from Alaska.


1104
01:16:51.313 --> 01:16:53.147
Where did you learn to dance like that?

1105
01:16:53.356 --> 01:16:55.858
And there are no starving people,
are there?


1106
01:16:56.026 --> 01:16:57.526
Why are you so angry with me?

1107
01:16:57.694 --> 01:17:01.280
- You think I'm some kind of sap, do you?
- No, I don't.


1108
01:17:01.448 --> 01:17:02.698
I admire you.

1109
01:17:02.866 --> 01:17:05.284
I fell in love with you
the very moment I saw you.


1110
01:17:05.452 --> 01:17:07.369
I want you to stop lying to me.

1111
01:17:08.955 --> 01:17:11.498
All right. I'll tell you everything.

1112
01:17:11.708 --> 01:17:15.002
- In 1962...
- Well, well, well.


1113
01:17:15.211 --> 01:17:16.587
Don't we clean up nice?

1114
01:17:18.381 --> 01:17:20.507
Well, hello, Cliff.

1115
01:17:20.717 --> 01:17:23.552
- How are you this evening?
- Not bad.


1116
01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:26.305
Though I, uh, do miss
that green sport coat of yours.


1117
01:17:26.473 --> 01:17:27.723
Oh, why, thank you, Cliff.

1118
01:17:27.891 --> 01:17:29.892
But that's my seat,
and I was just about...


1119
01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:31.727
How about a drink up at the bar?

1120
01:17:39.527 --> 01:17:40.986
Sure.

1121
01:17:41.154 --> 01:17:42.988
Excuse us.

1122
01:17:43.698 --> 01:17:45.407
It's all yours.

1123
01:18:15.772 --> 01:18:18.065
- Please excuse this interruption.
- Oh, brother.


1124
01:18:18.233 --> 01:18:21.276
Eve, I don't mean to be rude,
and, Cliff, please excuse me...


1125
01:18:21.444 --> 01:18:24.446
but, Eve,
isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?


1126
01:18:24.656 --> 01:18:26.115
- What?
- I'm sorry.


1127
01:18:26.282 --> 01:18:29.034
And legs. Legs, butt and hair.

1128
01:18:29.244 --> 01:18:31.370
- And shallow as well?
- Shallow?


1129
01:18:31.579 --> 01:18:33.288
Adam, why don't you go home?

1130
01:18:33.456 --> 01:18:36.375
- Go back to the hotel.
- Yeah, before I kick your ass.


1131
01:18:37.961 --> 01:18:40.587
I must warn you, Cliff,
I do know how to defend myself.


1132
01:18:40.755 --> 01:18:42.381
Oh, do you?

1133
01:18:43.383 --> 01:18:44.717
- Agh!
- Stop it, you two.


1134
01:18:44.926 --> 01:18:46.593
Nice move, really.

1135
01:18:46.803 --> 01:18:49.763
Yeah, Eve's right.
Maybe we shouldn't fight in here.


1136
01:18:49.931 --> 01:18:51.682
I agree.

1137
01:18:53.143 --> 01:18:55.019
- Ugh.
- Adam.


1138
01:18:55.186 --> 01:18:57.563
I'm sorry. He was gonna....

1139
01:18:58.231 --> 01:18:59.773
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all.

1140
01:18:59.941 --> 01:19:02.776
I mean, fighting's pretty immature
when you think about it.


1141
01:19:02.944 --> 01:19:07.156
- It certainly is.
- Eve, I'm leaving.


1142
01:19:07.323 --> 01:19:09.825
- That's probably a good idea.
- Eve, I'm sorry.


1143
01:19:09.993 --> 01:19:12.411
- Oh!
- Gah.


1144
01:19:13.455 --> 01:19:17.124
Well, good night, everyone.

1145
01:19:18.793 --> 01:19:20.753
- Eve...
- I'm leaving too, okay?


1146
01:19:20.962 --> 01:19:22.087
And you know what?

1147
01:19:22.255 --> 01:19:24.339
If you want help, ask Troy,
because I quit.


1148
01:19:24.591 --> 01:19:29.511
This is ridiculous.
You're ridiculous and I'm ridiculous.


1149
01:19:33.349 --> 01:19:36.101
I'll buy you another Rob Roy,
huh, champ?


1150
01:19:36.519 --> 01:19:38.228
Rob Roy for the gentleman.

1151
01:19:44.611 --> 01:19:46.028
Well?

1152
01:19:46.446 --> 01:19:48.030
He go back to the hotel?

1153
01:19:48.281 --> 01:19:51.450
- Um, he might have.
- What does that mean?


1154
01:19:51.618 --> 01:19:54.036
That means
that we did not leave together.


1155
01:19:54.245 --> 01:19:55.662
Well, who did he leave with?

1156
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:58.791
- What's that to you?
- I'm his pimp.


1157
01:19:58.958 --> 01:20:01.627
He left with those dancers, didn't he?

1158
01:20:02.545 --> 01:20:03.837
You're the psychic.

1159
01:20:04.005 --> 01:20:07.174
Eve, the psychic pimp. You tell me.

1160
01:20:07.342 --> 01:20:10.177
- Those sluts.
- Yeah.


1161
01:20:10.345 --> 01:20:13.263
Then again,
who isn't a slut these days, huh?


1162
01:20:14.849 --> 01:20:16.517
- Where are you going?
- To bed.


1163
01:20:16.684 --> 01:20:18.143
To bed?

1164
01:20:18.311 --> 01:20:20.187
Sure, to bed.

1165
01:20:20.355 --> 01:20:22.731
I'm not the one
that's in love with the guy.


1166
01:20:22.899 --> 01:20:25.067
- What? Oh.
- Mm-hm.


1167
01:20:25.235 --> 01:20:28.737
Now, hold on. Hold on just a minute.

1168
01:20:28.905 --> 01:20:31.657
In the first place,
I do not fall in love with weirdos...


1169
01:20:31.825 --> 01:20:33.992
who I've only known
for four or five days.


1170
01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:35.244
Yes, you do.

1171
01:20:35.411 --> 01:20:38.580
And I don't fall in love with grown men
who collect baseball cards.


1172
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:39.832
Yes, you do.

1173
01:20:39.999 --> 01:20:42.167
Or pee in their pants
when they see the ocean.


1174
01:20:42.335 --> 01:20:45.170
- Yes, you do.
- Or have perfect table manners.


1175
01:20:45.338 --> 01:20:47.589
You know, I asked him about that.

1176
01:20:47.841 --> 01:20:50.676
He said good manners
are just a way of showing people...


1177
01:20:50.844 --> 01:20:52.427
that we have respect for them.

1178
01:20:52.679 --> 01:20:55.806
I didn't know that. I thought
it was a way of acting superior.


1179
01:20:56.015 --> 01:20:58.725
- Oh, you know what else he told me?
- What?


1180
01:20:58.935 --> 01:21:01.562
He thinks I'm a gentleman
and you're a lady.


1181
01:21:04.399 --> 01:21:07.025
Well... Well, consider the source.

1182
01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:09.695
- I don't even know what a lady is.
- I know.


1183
01:21:09.863 --> 01:21:12.447
I thought a gentleman
was somebody that owned horses.


1184
01:21:12.615 --> 01:21:16.577
But it turns out the short and simple
definition of a lady or a gentleman...


1185
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:19.037
is someone who always tries
to make sure...


1186
01:21:19.205 --> 01:21:23.125
the people around him or her
are as comfortable as possible.


1187
01:21:23.293 --> 01:21:25.627
Where do you think
he got all that information?


1188
01:21:25.837 --> 01:21:29.256
Oh, from the oddest place. His parents.

1189
01:21:29.424 --> 01:21:31.758
I mean, I don't think
I got that memo from mine.


1190
01:21:31.968 --> 01:21:34.803
Now I suppose
he's trying to make those dancers...


1191
01:21:34.971 --> 01:21:37.639
feel as comfortable as possible.

1192
01:21:37.849 --> 01:21:40.642
No. He didn't go home with them.

1193
01:21:45.565 --> 01:21:47.316
Well....

1194
01:21:47.483 --> 01:21:48.775
He went home with Sophie.

1195
01:21:51.279 --> 01:21:52.863
- No!
- Yep.


1196
01:21:53.072 --> 01:21:54.573
No!

1197
01:21:54.782 --> 01:21:57.784
She swept him out of the room
whispering French sweet nothings.


1198
01:21:57.952 --> 01:22:00.954
No, not Sophie, not Sophie.
Don't tell me that.


1199
01:22:01.164 --> 01:22:04.166
So, what you gonna do,
go to her place and kick the door in?


1200
01:22:04.334 --> 01:22:06.960
You're goddamn right I am.

1201
01:22:08.171 --> 01:22:11.506
- You coming?
- You kidding? Sophie would kill me.


1202
01:22:12.508 --> 01:22:14.009
Oh, coward.

1203
01:22:14.594 --> 01:22:16.511
Gentleman coward.

1204
01:22:30.944 --> 01:22:32.402
Eve!

1205
01:22:34.489 --> 01:22:37.532
So scare me, why don't you?
You stupid son of a bitch.


1206
01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:40.535
- I'm really sorry.
- What are you doing here?


1207
01:22:40.703 --> 01:22:43.038
You're supposed to be
on San Vicente Boulevard...


1208
01:22:43.206 --> 01:22:45.916
having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie.

1209
01:22:46.417 --> 01:22:50.045
- I know, and I'm really sorry.
- I'm limping.


1210
01:22:50.296 --> 01:22:52.798
How attractive is that?
What if this is for life?


1211
01:22:52.966 --> 01:22:54.967
- Adam.
- Where the hell are those bandages?


1212
01:22:55.134 --> 01:22:57.052
- I was just gonna say...
- I know.


1213
01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:59.388
- And then she went, "Aah" and she....
- I know.


1214
01:22:59.555 --> 01:23:02.057
- I didn't mean to scare her.
- Of course you didn't.


1215
01:23:02.225 --> 01:23:04.393
Nothing I do with her
ever seems to be right.


1216
01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:06.895
Used to be up here with the coffee.
Why don't...?


1217
01:23:07.063 --> 01:23:10.399
That's because you're a nice boy...

1218
01:23:10.566 --> 01:23:13.485
but what Eve needs is a nice man.

1219
01:23:13.653 --> 01:23:17.155
Understand, champ? Good night.

1220
01:23:17.699 --> 01:23:19.324
Night, Troy.

1221
01:23:19.742 --> 01:23:20.867
You still here?

1222
01:23:21.035 --> 01:23:22.661
- Let me help.
- I can do it myself.


1223
01:23:22.829 --> 01:23:25.414
I know more about first aid
than you know about cards.


1224
01:23:25.581 --> 01:23:29.251
Give me the stuff and sit down. Sit.

1225
01:23:31.045 --> 01:23:33.839
Let me see. Give me your knee.

1226
01:23:35.591 --> 01:23:38.552
- These pants are ruined, right?
- I'd say so.


1227
01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:40.220
There.

1228
01:23:45.935 --> 01:23:48.353
- Aah.... Ouch.
- Steady.


1229
01:23:48.771 --> 01:23:53.442
- There. And don't be such a baby.
- Oh, I'm the baby?


1230
01:23:59.991 --> 01:24:01.491
Um....

1231
01:24:02.785 --> 01:24:04.286
Did, um...?

1232
01:24:06.122 --> 01:24:08.081
Did you go to Sophie's?

1233
01:24:09.292 --> 01:24:10.625
Of course.

1234
01:24:12.211 --> 01:24:13.962
And?

1235
01:24:14.422 --> 01:24:18.050
- She was hospitable.
- Hospitable?


1236
01:24:18.468 --> 01:24:20.135
Huh.

1237
01:24:23.306 --> 01:24:27.142
But it just wasn't
where I wanted to be.

1238
01:24:27.894 --> 01:24:32.898
So I left as politely as I could,
and I found a taxi...


1239
01:24:33.066 --> 01:24:37.110
and I told the driver to bring me here
instead of back to the hotel.


1240
01:24:40.656 --> 01:24:44.117
There is a song that Mr. Como sings...

1241
01:24:44.285 --> 01:24:46.244
called "On the Street Where You Live."

1242
01:24:46.412 --> 01:24:47.913
Do you know it?

1243
01:24:48.831 --> 01:24:50.916
Sing it to me.

1244
01:24:54.128 --> 01:24:56.004
Um....

1245
01:24:56.172 --> 01:25:00.258
I have often walked
Down this street before


1246
01:25:00.426 --> 01:25:05.430
But the pavement always stayed
Beneath my feet before


1247
01:25:05.598 --> 01:25:11.228
All at once am I
Several stories high


1248
01:25:11.396 --> 01:25:16.691
Knowing I'm on the street
Where you live


1249
01:25:16.859 --> 01:25:22.989
It's a song about a young man
who's overjoyed...


1250
01:25:24.867 --> 01:25:27.160
just to be standing
in front of the house...


1251
01:25:28.287 --> 01:25:33.458
of the person that he loves.

1252
01:25:47.098 --> 01:25:50.851
Adam, you know, I...

1253
01:25:58.818 --> 01:26:04.698
Adam, I know this is stupid,
but humor me.


1254
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:09.995
Have you ever had sex before?

1255
01:26:13.082 --> 01:26:14.166
No.

1256
01:26:16.252 --> 01:26:18.837
How is that possible?

1257
01:26:19.547 --> 01:26:21.673
You better sit back down.

1258
01:26:25.636 --> 01:26:28.096
In 1962, when the bomb
was dropped on Los Angeles...


1259
01:26:28.264 --> 01:26:31.099
my parents were in our fallout shelter.

1260
01:26:31.267 --> 01:26:32.517
That's where I was born.

1261
01:26:33.895 --> 01:26:36.271
We only survived
because it's a huge shelter...


1262
01:26:36.439 --> 01:26:39.357
as far as fallout shelters go.

1263
01:26:39.525 --> 01:26:43.111
My father worked on it secretly
for years.


1264
01:26:43.279 --> 01:26:46.573
When he had to, he used contractors,
but always from out of state...


1265
01:26:46.741 --> 01:26:48.950
and always for only a portion
of the job.


1266
01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:51.620
He told them it was a
secret government experiment...


1267
01:26:51.787 --> 01:26:53.038
done through Caltech.

1268
01:26:53.247 --> 01:26:54.581
Now, my dad's not a liar...

1269
01:26:54.749 --> 01:26:57.292
but in this case,
he felt he had no choice.


1270
01:26:57.460 --> 01:26:59.628
Of course, it had
to be kept a secret.

1271
01:26:59.795 --> 01:27:03.798
We only had enough supplies
to last three people for 35 years.


1272
01:27:03.966 --> 01:27:06.301
The really tricky part
was the air-vent system...


1273
01:27:06.469 --> 01:27:09.971
but we were finally able
to cut into the flood-control sewer....


1274
01:27:13.601 --> 01:27:17.646
Eve, what I would like to do...

1275
01:27:17.813 --> 01:27:20.482
is to take you with me
down into the fallout shelter.


1276
01:27:21.317 --> 01:27:24.319
We could live there
with my mom and dad.

1277
01:27:24.487 --> 01:27:27.614
My dad said
that if I found a healthy young girl...


1278
01:27:27.782 --> 01:27:30.116
that I should bring her on down.

1279
01:27:30.743 --> 01:27:32.661
Why, Eve...

1280
01:27:33.579 --> 01:27:36.915
you look plenty healthy to me.

1281
01:27:40.628 --> 01:27:43.505
- Adam?
- Yes, Eve?


1282
01:27:45.341 --> 01:27:48.176
I think it's time to call a cab.

1283
01:27:50.388 --> 01:27:52.347
Oh. Of course. 
You're absolutely right.

1284
01:27:52.515 --> 01:27:55.934
I really shouldn't be over here
at this late hour.


1285
01:27:58.729 --> 01:28:00.230
Mm-hm.

1286
01:28:04.443 --> 01:28:06.361
Good night, Adam.

1287
01:28:12.243 --> 01:28:13.994
Thank you.

1288
01:28:31.512 --> 01:28:35.015
- Goddamn, Adam.
- Wait a minute.


1289
01:28:36.183 --> 01:28:37.892
Oh, look, I'm sorry.

1290
01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:40.812
I know, I took the Lord's name
in vain again. I...


1291
01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:44.024
No. There's an adult bookstore
back there.


1292
01:28:44.191 --> 01:28:46.192
I'll be right back.

1293
01:28:59.874 --> 01:29:00.915
Give us a sign.

1294
01:29:01.083 --> 01:29:02.125
- Amen.
- Yeah.


1295
01:29:02.293 --> 01:29:03.501
- That's all we ask.
- Amen.


1296
01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:06.921
- Just give us some sort of sign.
- Amen.


1297
01:29:07.089 --> 01:29:12.052
- Just show us that we're not alone.
- Yeah.


1298
01:29:35.326 --> 01:29:36.743
Hi, Eve.

1299
01:29:36.911 --> 01:29:40.789
- Hi, Adam. This is....
- Hi, Adam, I'm Nina Aron.


1300
01:29:41.749 --> 01:29:43.917
- Hello, how do you do?
- Very well, thank you.


1301
01:29:44.085 --> 01:29:46.461
I'm with the county
Family Services Department.


1302
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:51.424
Eve tells me you've been living
in a bomb shelter most of your life.


1303
01:29:52.927 --> 01:29:56.137
Fallout shelter. 
There is a difference.

1304
01:29:56.347 --> 01:30:00.225
Adam, I'd like to introduce you
to my associate, Mr. Brown.


1305
01:30:01.394 --> 01:30:02.977
Hello.

1306
01:30:03.979 --> 01:30:05.480
We want you to come with us...

1307
01:30:05.648 --> 01:30:08.149
so we can talk some more
about your experiences.


1308
01:30:08.317 --> 01:30:10.985
- Come where?
- My office.


1309
01:30:11.153 --> 01:30:12.987
For how long?

1310
01:30:13.155 --> 01:30:14.948
Well, that depends.

1311
01:30:15.157 --> 01:30:17.492
Well, I thank you very much
for the invitation...


1312
01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:18.993
but I'm very busy today.

1313
01:30:19.161 --> 01:30:23.456
- Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
- I think you should go with Dr. Aron.


1314
01:30:24.417 --> 01:30:26.960
I think it's the best thing.

1315
01:30:27.128 --> 01:30:30.338
I think it's the best thing
for you, I do.


1316
01:30:36.137 --> 01:30:37.679
All right, Eve, if you say so.

1317
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:41.266
I do.

1318
01:30:43.269 --> 01:30:44.769
Could I please just go home?

1319
01:30:44.937 --> 01:30:47.355
I was lost,
but I found home this morning.


1320
01:30:47.523 --> 01:30:52.152
And if I can just go home, I promise
I'll never bother any of you ever again.


1321
01:30:52.361 --> 01:30:55.697
Adam, uh, let's go talk first.

1322
01:30:59.326 --> 01:31:02.287
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.


1323
01:31:05.207 --> 01:31:06.416
Bye, Adam.

1324
01:31:08.169 --> 01:31:09.878
Bye, Troy.

1325
01:31:16.844 --> 01:31:20.680
- You'll be hearing from me.
- Oh, yes.


1326
01:31:23.017 --> 01:31:25.894
What? What was I supposed to do?

1327
01:31:26.061 --> 01:31:28.188
He told me he wanted
to take me underground.


1328
01:31:28.355 --> 01:31:31.733
That's like Silence of the Lambs.
It's crazy.


1329
01:31:31.942 --> 01:31:34.652
Yeah. You did the right thing.

1330
01:31:38.449 --> 01:31:40.533
- Hey, hey.
- Oh, no.


1331
01:31:40.743 --> 01:31:41.993
Where you going?

1332
01:31:43.829 --> 01:31:45.580
- Oh, my God.
- All right, don't worry.


1333
01:31:45.748 --> 01:31:48.875
Don't worry, he'll catch him.
Yes, this is Nina Aron.


1334
01:31:49.084 --> 01:31:51.753
I've got a runaway,
and I'm gonna need police assistance.


1335
01:31:51.962 --> 01:31:54.339
- No, you cannot call them.
- Young lady, I have to.


1336
01:31:54.507 --> 01:31:56.758
If a complaint is made
and the person resists...


1337
01:31:56.926 --> 01:31:58.218
No, I cannot have that.

1338
01:31:58.427 --> 01:32:01.054
They'll come with their cars
and their guns and...


1339
01:32:01.222 --> 01:32:02.847
All right, all right. Calm down.

1340
01:32:03.015 --> 01:32:06.267
Now, that young man needs help,
and you need protection from him.


1341
01:32:06.477 --> 01:32:07.602
I was frightened.

1342
01:32:07.770 --> 01:32:12.273
I didn't know what to think,
but, you know, I believe him.


1343
01:32:12.441 --> 01:32:13.733
I think he just...

1344
01:32:13.943 --> 01:32:17.278
I do. I really think he just wants
to go home, wherever that might be.


1345
01:32:17.446 --> 01:32:20.865
All right, everybody has to calm down.
That's the most important thing.


1346
01:32:21.033 --> 01:32:22.617
- Eve. Here's my hotel key.
- Adam.


1347
01:32:22.785 --> 01:32:25.703
You can have my baseball cards.
Don't forget to pay my bill.


1348
01:32:25.871 --> 01:32:28.957
You stop right there.
Stop. Don't get in that truck.


1349
01:32:29.124 --> 01:32:31.793
Adam, you gotta stop
trying to drive this truck.


1350
01:32:31.961 --> 01:32:33.086
- Bye, Troy.
- Bye, Adam.


1351
01:32:33.254 --> 01:32:34.754
Thanks for always being happy.

1352
01:32:34.922 --> 01:32:37.131
- What?
- Gay.


1353
01:32:39.677 --> 01:32:41.886
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1354
01:32:42.054 --> 01:32:44.889
That's my car, you son of a bitch!

1355
01:32:45.474 --> 01:32:47.976
- Where the hell have you been?
- I fell down.


1356
01:32:48.143 --> 01:32:50.311
You guys get the license number
on that truck?


1357
01:32:50.479 --> 01:32:53.398
What are you asking them for?
They're as screwed up as he is.


1358
01:32:53.566 --> 01:32:55.817
Everybody keep calm.
That's the important thing.


1359
01:32:56.026 --> 01:32:57.652
Who you talking to, you stupid...?

1360
01:32:57.820 --> 01:33:00.029
- Eve! Eve!
- Okay, okay, okay.


1361
01:33:08.330 --> 01:33:11.791
Mom? Dad? I'm home.

1362
01:33:12.543 --> 01:33:15.378
Oh! Oh.

1363
01:33:15.546 --> 01:33:17.922
Adam. Oh, Adam.

1364
01:33:18.966 --> 01:33:21.509
- Oh.
- I've got almost everything we need.


1365
01:33:21.677 --> 01:33:24.679
- And this nice man...
- Archbishop Melker.


1366
01:33:24.847 --> 01:33:26.264
We met previously.

1367
01:33:26.473 --> 01:33:29.183
...and his church group volunteered
to help bring it down.


1368
01:33:29.435 --> 01:33:32.103
- But we've gotta hurry.
- Are you in trouble, son?


1369
01:33:32.271 --> 01:33:34.647
I think I'm being chased
by a psychiatrist.


1370
01:33:34.815 --> 01:33:37.108
- A psychiatrist?
- It happens.


1371
01:33:37.568 --> 01:33:40.820
Oh, my goodness. 
How bad is it up there?

1372
01:33:41.363 --> 01:33:43.031
Horrible.

1373
01:33:44.658 --> 01:33:46.784
There's something on your forehead.

1374
01:33:46.994 --> 01:33:49.579
- Calvin.
- I know.


1375
01:34:09.642 --> 01:34:12.060
Okay.

1376
01:34:26.492 --> 01:34:27.575
Is this it?

1377
01:34:31.497 --> 01:34:36.084
- Well, what are we gonna do with it?
- Give it back to him.


1378
01:34:36.251 --> 01:34:38.711
- And what if we can't find him?
- We'll find him.


1379
01:34:38.879 --> 01:34:40.505
Well....

1380
01:35:00.734 --> 01:35:03.194
Hey, Eve.

1381
01:35:04.113 --> 01:35:08.241
Eve, uh, look what I found in the suitcase.
It's stock certificates.


1382
01:35:08.409 --> 01:35:09.617
I mean, it's got, like...

1383
01:35:09.785 --> 01:35:13.788
It's got, like, IBM and AT&T
and Polaroid and....


1384
01:35:13.956 --> 01:35:17.542
Ipana? I remember this brand.

1385
01:35:17.710 --> 01:35:20.044
I didn't know they still made this.

1386
01:35:22.631 --> 01:35:27.927
Oh. Look at this.
It says, "Trademark 1961."


1387
01:35:31.932 --> 01:35:34.058
Hurry, my friends,
we have no time to waste.


1388
01:35:34.226 --> 01:35:36.936
The son has spoken. 
Let's step it up.

1389
01:35:37.146 --> 01:35:41.065
Leave my elevator alone.
Leave my elevator alone.


1390
01:35:41.233 --> 01:35:43.818
We're losing the light.

1391
01:35:44.069 --> 01:35:47.905
Purchased in 1958 and '59?
Ten thousand shares of each?


1392
01:35:48.073 --> 01:35:49.824
- Mm-hm.
- They'd be worth millions.


1393
01:35:49.992 --> 01:35:53.077
Hell, I don't know.
Millions upon millions...


1394
01:35:53.287 --> 01:35:54.996
Upon millions.

1395
01:35:55.414 --> 01:36:01.294
The stocks, the baseball cards,
the clothes, the toothpaste.


1396
01:36:01.462 --> 01:36:03.463
The guy's on the level.

1397
01:36:04.131 --> 01:36:05.673
Eve.

1398
01:36:05.841 --> 01:36:09.969
Eve, a man walks into your life
who's the kindest, most polite...


1399
01:36:10.137 --> 01:36:12.180
most incredibly rich guy
you've ever met.


1400
01:36:12.347 --> 01:36:14.682
And I have him committed.

1401
01:36:14.850 --> 01:36:18.102
Yes. Yes, you did.

1402
01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:20.188
Yeah.

1403
01:36:21.190 --> 01:36:24.776
Well, at least I fell for him
before I found out he was rich.


1404
01:36:24.943 --> 01:36:27.612
- That's new.
- Yeah.


1405
01:36:28.947 --> 01:36:33.534
He said today he knew where home was.
Where'd you guys go this morning?


1406
01:36:34.203 --> 01:36:36.704
Just to pick up frozen poultry.

1407
01:36:36.872 --> 01:36:39.665
- Then?
- Then back to the house.


1408
01:36:39.833 --> 01:36:42.043
You didn't stop anywhere?

1409
01:36:44.296 --> 01:36:46.881
We did. We stopped at a porn shop.

1410
01:36:47.382 --> 01:36:50.885
We stopped at this adult bookstore.
Adam was very excited to see it.


1411
01:36:51.053 --> 01:36:55.014
- Adam was very excited to see porn?
- Yes.


1412
01:36:55.182 --> 01:36:58.059
Eve, do you think maybe his home...

1413
01:36:58.268 --> 01:37:01.479
is underneath a dirty bookstore
in the Valley?


1414
01:37:06.735 --> 01:37:10.196
- Is this it?
- Yeah. Yeah, this is the place.


1415
01:37:29.591 --> 01:37:33.177
Harder. Adam? Adam?

1416
01:37:34.596 --> 01:37:37.181
Um, heh. Do you have a basement?

1417
01:37:37.349 --> 01:37:41.602
Believe me, all the really good stuff
is right up front.


1418
01:37:43.272 --> 01:37:45.064
Is there a back entrance or something?

1419
01:37:45.274 --> 01:37:47.233
Are you kidding? Of course.

1420
01:37:47.442 --> 01:37:49.944
Nice kid. Nice kid.

1421
01:37:52.072 --> 01:37:54.949
What are we looking for?
This is ridiculous.


1422
01:37:55.117 --> 01:37:57.743
Why would they put a fallout shelter
under a porn shop?


1423
01:37:57.911 --> 01:37:59.579
None of this was here back in '62.

1424
01:37:59.746 --> 01:38:02.123
Back then this was all, like,
cute little homes...


1425
01:38:02.291 --> 01:38:05.042
and, you know, fruit orchards.

1426
01:38:05.252 --> 01:38:07.837
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?

1427
01:38:09.131 --> 01:38:12.884
- I wanna go home.
- Yeah. Maybe he'll call, huh?


1428
01:38:14.261 --> 01:38:16.220
Uh, Eve?

1429
01:38:16.388 --> 01:38:18.139
This is Adam.

1430
01:38:18.974 --> 01:38:22.435
Look, I just wanted to thank you
for everything you did for me.


1431
01:38:22.603 --> 01:38:26.147
And I wanted to tell you that I....

1432
01:38:26.607 --> 01:38:28.816
That, uh....

1433
01:38:28.984 --> 01:38:31.319
That I wish so
many good things for you.

1434
01:38:31.486 --> 01:38:34.989
I wish so hard
that all of your dreams come true.


1435
01:38:35.157 --> 01:38:37.241
And that...

1436
01:38:37.409 --> 01:38:40.661
And that's all I... 
And that's all.

1437
01:39:06.104 --> 01:39:09.398
Surprise. Bang! Ha-ha-ha.

1438
01:39:12.778 --> 01:39:15.154
Stay out of here, you drunk.

1439
01:39:17.908 --> 01:39:20.368
Mm-mm-mm.

1440
01:39:40.639 --> 01:39:42.306
Adam?

1441
01:40:20.554 --> 01:40:25.391
- How long you gonna set it for this time?
- I thought 10 years.


1442
01:40:25.767 --> 01:40:30.604
Well, it's considerably shorter
than before...


1443
01:40:31.106 --> 01:40:34.775
but I was wondering, Calvin,
I mean, why set the locks at all?


1444
01:40:34.985 --> 01:40:36.402
I mean, the radiation's gone.

1445
01:40:36.570 --> 01:40:39.280
To keep what's up there
from getting down here.


1446
01:40:39.448 --> 01:40:42.491
It's not radiation I'm worried about.

1447
01:40:42.868 --> 01:40:44.535
Mom. Dad.

1448
01:40:47.748 --> 01:40:49.290
Oh, ho.

1449
01:40:54.755 --> 01:40:57.923
I would like for you to meet
Miss Eve Rustokov.


1450
01:40:58.091 --> 01:41:00.259
- Mrs. Webber.
- Hello.


1451
01:41:00.427 --> 01:41:02.136
- Mr. Webber.
- Hello.


1452
01:41:02.804 --> 01:41:05.723
Adam's told me
such wonderful things about you.


1453
01:41:06.308 --> 01:41:08.392
Oh, well, excuse us, please.

1454
01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:12.480
- We haven't entertained a guest in...
- Quite some time.


1455
01:41:12.647 --> 01:41:15.483
Oh, Eve, what can I offer you?

1456
01:41:15.650 --> 01:41:19.153
- Mom, Eve and I have to go.
- Oh, Adam, you just got here.


1457
01:41:19.321 --> 01:41:22.656
I can't explain now, but I want you
to set the locks for two months.


1458
01:41:22.824 --> 01:41:25.910
You've got enough of everything.
We'll be right back to get you.


1459
01:41:26.078 --> 01:41:28.037
But I don't understand.

1460
01:41:28.246 --> 01:41:31.415
And I'm asking you to trust me
without understanding why.


1461
01:41:31.625 --> 01:41:35.169
- In that case, of course.
- Of course, son.


1462
01:41:35.337 --> 01:41:38.631
- They really are wonderful parents.
- Ha-ha-ha.


1463
01:41:39.216 --> 01:41:42.176
Oh, Adam.
Could you at least stay for dinner?


1464
01:41:42.344 --> 01:41:45.054
- Well, we do....
- You must.


1465
01:41:47.724 --> 01:41:49.225
Perfect.

1466
01:41:49.393 --> 01:41:51.310
Now, tell me if you've heard this one.

1467
01:41:51.478 --> 01:41:53.646
Duck walks into a drugstore.

1468
01:41:53.814 --> 01:41:58.776
This gravy is an old favorite of Calvin's.
Now, Eve, the platter is down there.


1469
01:41:58.944 --> 01:42:00.986
Would you get that, honey?

1470
01:42:01.154 --> 01:42:05.241
The sperm swims toward the egg. Pop.

1471
01:42:05.409 --> 01:42:06.867
- Into the egg.
- But why?


1472
01:42:07.035 --> 01:42:08.619
Because it must.

1473
01:42:08.787 --> 01:42:13.374
- But why?
- Because it's out there.


1474
01:42:14.084 --> 01:42:17.711
I don't mean to be nosy,
but are you and Adam dating?


1475
01:42:17.879 --> 01:42:19.922
Yeah, we are.

1476
01:42:21.383 --> 01:42:24.343
And I'm from Pasadena.

1477
01:42:27.722 --> 01:42:31.225
And you thought your parents were weird.

1478
01:42:32.227 --> 01:42:35.563
It's truly amazing what you can get
done when you have unlimited funds.


1479
01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:39.900
Do you know you can have whole
houses built in just a matter of months?


1480
01:42:40.068 --> 01:42:42.486
It's like the Garden of Eden,
don't you think?


1481
01:42:42.696 --> 01:42:45.448
All you have to say is this:
"I don't care what it costs."


1482
01:42:45.615 --> 01:42:48.742
Of course, you've gotta really mean it,
which no one ever does.


1483
01:42:49.411 --> 01:42:51.954
It took a while
to convince Archbishop Melker...


1484
01:42:52.122 --> 01:42:53.497
that Adam wasn't God...

1485
01:42:53.707 --> 01:42:56.041
and he was pretty broken up
about it too.


1486
01:42:56.209 --> 01:43:00.129
Until I showed him my plans
for Los Angeles' hottest nightspot.


1487
01:43:00.297 --> 01:43:01.589
It's my goddamn malt shop.

1488
01:43:01.756 --> 01:43:04.258
- Let's figure out what's gonna happen.
- Okay.


1489
01:43:04.426 --> 01:43:07.761
Now, I want the whole ownership
of everything downstairs, all right?


1490
01:43:07.929 --> 01:43:10.723
- Well...
- I want one of my guys at the door.


1491
01:43:13.643 --> 01:43:18.147
Our idea was to bring Adam's parents
up to the surface very slowly...


1492
01:43:18.315 --> 01:43:21.650
make them very comfortable,
and then break the bad news to them...


1493
01:43:21.818 --> 01:43:25.112
that there was no nuclear holocaust.

1494
01:43:39.169 --> 01:43:40.628
Oh, Adam.

1495
01:43:52.974 --> 01:43:55.309
Oh, son.

1496
01:43:59.356 --> 01:44:03.734
Okay. And here you go. Careful.

1497
01:44:10.534 --> 01:44:12.117
It's hot.

1498
01:44:12.327 --> 01:44:13.827
Careful.

1499
01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:21.377
Have you ever in your life seen a son
who did more for his parents?


1500
01:44:22.170 --> 01:44:24.797
This is beautiful.

1501
01:44:25.715 --> 01:44:29.009
- It's absolutely beautiful.
- Yeah.


1502
01:44:29.177 --> 01:44:34.807
Well, we seem to have everything,
but, you know...


1503
01:44:35.559 --> 01:44:39.520
it's not much different
from the fallout shelter.


1504
01:44:40.355 --> 01:44:44.900
No, Calvin, this is different,
believe me.


1505
01:44:48.238 --> 01:44:52.449
This is great, son.

1506
01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:56.829
By the way....

1507
01:44:58.164 --> 01:45:02.751
Eve, her last name, Rustokov,
that's not Russian, is it?


1508
01:45:02.919 --> 01:45:05.963
No, it's, uh, Ukrainian.
Her grandparents immigrated.


1509
01:45:10.218 --> 01:45:12.177
Dad, I don't know
how to tell you this...


1510
01:45:12.345 --> 01:45:15.472
and I was gonna wait for a while
to do it, but, um....


1511
01:45:18.018 --> 01:45:21.770
Dad, there was no bomb.
A plane crashed in our back yard.


1512
01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:24.648
I looked it up in old newspapers.

1513
01:45:25.275 --> 01:45:27.610
- Are you sure?
- Positive.


1514
01:45:27.819 --> 01:45:30.696
The Soviet Union collapsed
without a shot being fired.


1515
01:45:30.864 --> 01:45:32.364
The Cold War's over.

1516
01:45:36.244 --> 01:45:38.704
That's what everyone believes?

1517
01:45:38.872 --> 01:45:40.664
Oh, yes, sir.

1518
01:45:40.832 --> 01:45:42.291
And it's true.

1519
01:45:43.501 --> 01:45:47.755
What, the Politburo one day said:

1520
01:45:48.506 --> 01:45:51.258
"We give up"? Ha-ha-ha.

1521
01:45:52.052 --> 01:45:54.511
Yes, that's kind of how it went.

1522
01:45:54.721 --> 01:45:57.890
My gosh, those commies are brilliant.

1523
01:45:58.058 --> 01:45:59.933
You have to hand it to them.

1524
01:46:00.143 --> 01:46:02.770
"No, we didn't drop any bombs.

1525
01:46:02.937 --> 01:46:07.107
Oh, yeah, our evil empire has collapsed.
Poor us."


1526
01:46:07.275 --> 01:46:11.445
I'll bet they even asked the West
for aid.


1527
01:46:11.655 --> 01:46:12.946
Right?

1528
01:46:13.114 --> 01:46:15.658
Um, I think they did.

1529
01:46:15.867 --> 01:46:19.119
Oh, boys. Dinnertime.

1530
01:46:19.287 --> 01:46:20.371
Pot roast.

1531
01:46:25.543 --> 01:46:27.211
I'll tell you.

1532
01:46:29.381 --> 01:46:31.090
Funny guy.

1533
01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:34.968
- Don't tell your mother.
- No, okay.


1534
01:46:35.136 --> 01:46:38.305
Adam says that
this is simply how things work.


1535
01:46:38.473 --> 01:46:40.808
First the parents
take care of the children...


1536
01:46:40.975 --> 01:46:43.560
and then the children
take care of the parents.


1537
01:46:43.728 --> 01:46:46.814
He says historically,
that's how it works.


1538
01:46:46.981 --> 01:46:49.483
Damn commies.

1539
01:46:52.779 --> 01:46:56.990
Whenever Adam gives me
such obviously incorrect information...


1540
01:46:57.158 --> 01:47:02.121
I just smile, slap him on the knee,
and look out the window.


1541
01:47:02.288 --> 01:47:03.664
Why spoil his dreams?

1542
01:47:04.582 --> 01:47:07.793
They're such wonderful dreams.
