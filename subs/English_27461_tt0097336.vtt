1
00:02:03.688 --> 00:02:06.983
Boy, those Japs better watch out
for you, sir. Good luck.


2
00:02:07.108 --> 00:02:09.568
The Corps of Engineers
is gonna miss you, sir.


3
00:02:09.694 --> 00:02:12.613
- Thank you, gentlemen. Bronson.
- Sir.


4
00:02:12.738 --> 00:02:16.701
I built this place,
so I'll be glad to eat it.


5
00:02:19.328 --> 00:02:21.622
Well done, sir.

6
00:02:21.747 --> 00:02:24.083
You're a lucky man.
Give those japs hell.


7
00:02:24.208 --> 00:02:26.669
Thank you, Thomas.

8
00:02:26.794 --> 00:02:29.422
Indeed, I will.

9
00:02:33.342 --> 00:02:34.677
Sir!

10
00:02:34.802 --> 00:02:37.847
I'm losing my chance
to get out from behind a desk


11
00:02:37.972 --> 00:02:41.976
- and lead men in combat!
- Colonel Groves, forget it. This has...


12
00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:44.520
Even Bronson
wants to head for the front.


13
00:02:44.645 --> 00:02:47.106
Forget about the front.
You're an engineer.


14
00:02:47.231 --> 00:02:50.067
You're gonna fight your war here.

15
00:02:50.192 --> 00:02:55.031
Is this what you're assigning me to,
this boondoggle? Dead end?


16
00:02:55.156 --> 00:02:58.909
This dead end, Groves, has the
personal backing of the president.


17
00:02:59.035 --> 00:03:02.038
This is not what I was promised,
not what I expected.


18
00:03:02.163 --> 00:03:05.708
Then bone up on it.
Head to Chicago, talk to the scientist.


19
00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:07.960
If it looks possible, run with it.

20
00:03:08.085 --> 00:03:12.381
Take whoever you want. Have
whatever you need. Just make it work.


21
00:03:12.506 --> 00:03:15.593
Who knows, you might just win
this war on your own.


22
00:03:15.718 --> 00:03:19.180
Pick up a star on the way.

23
00:03:50.044 --> 00:03:54.882
<i>fighting for, and they are reported
to be giving the Germans hell.</i>


24
00:03:55.007 --> 00:03:59.220
<i>Though these losses represent the
most serious setbacks for the Allies</i>


25
00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:02.139
<i>in this war
against the Nazi enemy.</i>


26
00:04:02.932 --> 00:04:05.685
<i>Bad news, too,
from the war in the Pacific.</i>


27
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.855
<i>We have just had confirmation of
the sinking of three US cruisers.</i>


28
00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:12.858
<i>Names are being withheld.
The casualties are high.</i>


29
00:04:12.984 --> 00:04:14.527
Come in!

30
00:04:14.652 --> 00:04:19.907
<i>Reports of an early-morning raid
by Japanese dive-bombers...</i>


31
00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.868
In here. In here!

32
00:04:22.994 --> 00:04:25.871
- Szard?
- Szilard.


33
00:04:25.997 --> 00:04:30.584
General Groves, I was expecting you.
Come in! Come in!


34
00:04:40.052 --> 00:04:43.848
Forgive me.
Sometimes I get stuck in here.


35
00:04:43.973 --> 00:04:46.058
Metaphorically.

36
00:04:46.183 --> 00:04:48.060
I've read this.

37
00:04:48.185 --> 00:04:51.480
- Is it possible?
- You couldn't put a little more hot in,


38
00:04:51.605 --> 00:04:54.108
could you?

39
00:05:02.575 --> 00:05:07.538
And I'm not very good at fairy tales,
so just give me the happy ending.


40
00:05:09.081 --> 00:05:13.753
What I wrote is possible,
probably inevitable.


41
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.257
Separate uranium 235,
then arrange for two portions


42
00:05:18.382 --> 00:05:22.928
of the element to be brought together
suddenly, so that the resulting mass,


43
00:05:23.054 --> 00:05:25.181
no bigger than this, general,

44
00:05:25.306 --> 00:05:29.143
undergoes a spontaneous
self-generating reaction.


45
00:05:29.268 --> 00:05:34.774
And if this was the epicenter
of that explosion...


46
00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:40.613
all of Chicago you could see
from here would disintegrate.


47
00:05:40.821 --> 00:05:42.365
Hallelujah.

48
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.411
At the moment, all we have
are theories, concepts, inspirations,


49
00:05:47.536 --> 00:05:51.040
- inconclusive results...
- Now, if we can make this device,


50
00:05:51.165 --> 00:05:53.292
- so can the Krauts.
- Yes.


51
00:05:53.417 --> 00:05:55.878
Germany has the scientific capability.

52
00:05:56.003 --> 00:05:59.674
And, general,
we need leadership here.


53
00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:01.384
- I can help!
- Thank you.


54
00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:04.220
You need an ally, general!

55
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.813
- So tell us about this general.
- Why?


56
00:06:13.938 --> 00:06:16.565
Because it's so mysterious.

57
00:06:16.691 --> 00:06:19.068
"Meet me in the middle
of god-knows-where.


58
00:06:19.193 --> 00:06:24.740
Be there no earlier than 4:20,
no later than 4:29."


59
00:06:24.865 --> 00:06:26.909
Well, word has it

60
00:06:27.034 --> 00:06:28.953
he's a provincial windbag

61
00:06:29.078 --> 00:06:32.790
who's spent most of his life
digging holes in Latin America.


62
00:06:32.915 --> 00:06:35.710
- Graves for the natives, no doubt.
- Oh, Frank.


63
00:06:35.835 --> 00:06:38.713
Seriously, Kitty, after all,
Robert's a scientist.


64
00:06:38.838 --> 00:06:42.008
If the Army wants him,
they'll want all of him.


65
00:06:42.133 --> 00:06:44.969
All of him?
Why not take all of him?


66
00:06:45.094 --> 00:06:48.097
Look, I have to at least hear
what he has to offer.


67
00:06:48.222 --> 00:06:51.350
- Robert, must we go so fast?
- Yes!


68
00:06:51.475 --> 00:06:56.147
- It's crazy.
- Yes! Yes!


69
00:07:03.237 --> 00:07:06.449
This way, Dr. Oppenheimer.

70
00:07:29.597 --> 00:07:31.223
Doctor!

71
00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:33.184
Up here!

72
00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:38.689
Groves, Leslie. Friends call me Dick.
Sit down.


73
00:07:40.316 --> 00:07:41.942
Ingenuity.

74
00:07:42.068 --> 00:07:46.322
I love it.
Created out of nothing but up here.


75
00:07:46.447 --> 00:07:48.949
Clear!

76
00:07:53.496 --> 00:07:57.083
The old man likes his privacy,
doesn't he?


77
00:08:16.644 --> 00:08:18.604
Guess what.

78
00:08:18.729 --> 00:08:23.693
- The egghead wants a carrot juice.
- Get him what he wants, Bronson!


79
00:08:23.818 --> 00:08:25.152
Get used to it.

80
00:08:25.277 --> 00:08:29.198
What an eight ball this guy is.

81
00:08:30.116 --> 00:08:32.576
Seems this Oppenheimer's
a hot number.


82
00:08:32.702 --> 00:08:36.038
Says here, he's got more damn brains
than are decent.


83
00:08:36.163 --> 00:08:40.501
He knows it too. Temperamental. He
ain't gonna be an easy horse to corral.


84
00:08:40.626 --> 00:08:44.088
Oh, I think the general
knows what he's doing.


85
00:08:44.213 --> 00:08:46.090
Oppenheimer ain't one of us.

86
00:08:46.215 --> 00:08:50.136
The general picks that guy,
he'll be making a mistake.


87
00:08:54.932 --> 00:08:58.644
It needs to get pulled together.

88
00:09:00.146 --> 00:09:05.067
So I think you're
the man for the job.

89
00:09:07.403 --> 00:09:10.948
And I got a weakness for good men.

90
00:09:12.533 --> 00:09:16.078
The Krauts are working on this,
full bore.


91
00:09:16.203 --> 00:09:19.582
If they get it before we do,
I don't have to spell it out.


92
00:09:19.707 --> 00:09:21.959
Where would you start?

93
00:09:22.084 --> 00:09:23.919
Focus.

94
00:09:24.045 --> 00:09:27.506
You have great minds,
but all dancing to a different tune.


95
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:31.844
You bring them together in one place,
isolate them, no distractions.


96
00:09:31.969 --> 00:09:34.597
You create an atmosphere
of creative stress.


97
00:09:34.722 --> 00:09:37.892
Everyone competing
to solve one problem.


98
00:09:38.017 --> 00:09:40.644
And you have one ringmaster.

99
00:09:41.354 --> 00:09:45.149
Right now, it's all over the place.
You centralize everything.


100
00:09:45.274 --> 00:09:47.276
There is a hitch.

101
00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:50.905
There are people out there
don't like the color of your politics.


102
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.282
My politics...

103
00:09:53.407 --> 00:09:56.160
are an open book.

104
00:09:56.827 --> 00:09:59.413
Well, I hope so.

105
00:09:59.538 --> 00:10:03.459
You could win a war
and the Nobel Prize, god willing.


106
00:10:03.584 --> 00:10:06.962
Sir, Major de Silva
wanted me to remind you


107
00:10:07.088 --> 00:10:09.590
you've got a train to catch
at 1800 hours.


108
00:10:09.715 --> 00:10:12.635
No rest for the wicked.

109
00:10:14.261 --> 00:10:17.014
Oh, doctor.

110
00:10:17.264 --> 00:10:23.312
If you take this on,
I say this in all humility, intellect...


111
00:10:23.437 --> 00:10:26.190
don't outrank that.

112
00:10:29.068 --> 00:10:31.696
This general is a meatball,
a cipher.


113
00:10:31.821 --> 00:10:34.991
He'd be eating out of the palm
of my hand in a week.


114
00:10:35.116 --> 00:10:37.910
So will you accept?

115
00:10:39.912 --> 00:10:44.834
There are questions.
There are a kaleidoscope of questions.


116
00:10:45.793 --> 00:10:47.795
I see.

117
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.091
Well, I'm a star
at breakfast small talk.


118
00:10:52.216 --> 00:10:57.013
You'll have to save some for evenings
if you're gonna be wife of the big cheese.


119
00:10:57.138 --> 00:11:00.057
Would this mean moving?

120
00:11:00.182 --> 00:11:02.893
Oh, you have to say yes.

121
00:11:03.019 --> 00:11:05.563
You're too brilliant for Berkeley.

122
00:11:05.688 --> 00:11:13.404
Michelangelo's The Creation
of Adam. Origin and destiny.


123
00:11:14.488 --> 00:11:16.991
Origins and destiny.

124
00:11:17.116 --> 00:11:20.536
The struggle to unearth the one
and to discover the other.


125
00:11:20.661 --> 00:11:22.538
That is science!

126
00:11:22.663 --> 00:11:26.042
And as I leave here
to unravel my own small destiny,


127
00:11:26.167 --> 00:11:29.587
I congratulate each of you
on being the best of the best.


128
00:11:29.712 --> 00:11:31.672
I have faith in you all.

129
00:11:31.797 --> 00:11:36.302
God keep you, and may your lives
be rich and sweet.


130
00:11:36.427 --> 00:11:38.512
- Thank you.
- We'll miss you, Oppie!


131
00:11:38.637 --> 00:11:40.514
We'll miss you, Oppie!

132
00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:43.476
Good luck, Oppie!

133
00:12:05.873 --> 00:12:09.669
Hurry up!
Move it, move it!


134
00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:13.005
Let's move that thing out back.

135
00:12:19.553 --> 00:12:21.847
Sir!

136
00:12:54.797 --> 00:12:57.842
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Give me the good news, Jack.


137
00:12:57.967 --> 00:13:00.302
We've got utilities on
throughout camp.


138
00:13:00.428 --> 00:13:04.432
We've got the sewage problem taken
care of. We have water throughout.


139
00:13:04.557 --> 00:13:07.601
- Got the two science buildings...
- Not good enough.


140
00:13:07.727 --> 00:13:10.062
We got to be
a couple of weeks behind.


141
00:13:10.187 --> 00:13:12.982
You know, I got a bunch
of scientists up there.


142
00:13:13.107 --> 00:13:15.901
They're just wandering,
bumping into each other.


143
00:13:16.027 --> 00:13:19.655
Get some bodies in here. In a week,
I want to be two weeks ahead.


144
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.116
I don't think we have
accommodations, sir.


145
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:24.285
Why would they want
accommodations?


146
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.120
You think they'll sleep?

147
00:13:26.245 --> 00:13:31.167
All right, get some tents,
but put it on your EOR.


148
00:13:31.292 --> 00:13:34.211
Didn't I ask for dogs
around that perimeter fence?


149
00:13:34.337 --> 00:13:36.088
- Yes, sir.
- I don't see any.


150
00:13:36.213 --> 00:13:38.799
They're coming, general.

151
00:13:44.764 --> 00:13:47.183
So...

152
00:13:47.475 --> 00:13:51.645
whatever goes on around here
is privileged information.


153
00:13:51.771 --> 00:13:58.694
No exceptions. No wives, no barbers.
No exceptions!


154
00:13:58.819 --> 00:14:00.946
What you see,

155
00:14:01.072 --> 00:14:06.160
what you hear, what you read,
what you dream about,


156
00:14:06.285 --> 00:14:08.496
whatever...

157
00:14:08.621 --> 00:14:13.209
gives you heartburn or feeds your
ulcers, whatever gives you the sweats,


158
00:14:13.334 --> 00:14:16.170
keeps you up at night, whatever,

159
00:14:16.295 --> 00:14:18.673
all of that...

160
00:14:18.798 --> 00:14:23.594
belongs to the United States Army.

161
00:14:23.969 --> 00:14:28.641
Or to me, if that makes you feel
more comfortable.


162
00:14:28.766 --> 00:14:32.520
Now, you got to come down
out of the clouds, gentlemen,


163
00:14:32.645 --> 00:14:37.400
and get into the business
of winning a war.


164
00:14:37.525 --> 00:14:41.570
I'm gonna say it once.
I'm only gonna say it once.


165
00:14:41.696 --> 00:14:45.199
Those of you who know, know.
Those of you who don't, don't.


166
00:14:45.324 --> 00:14:51.038
You are not here to be comfortable.

167
00:14:51.163 --> 00:14:53.499
All right?

168
00:14:55.292 --> 00:14:58.045
You are here

169
00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:02.550
to go beyond the theoretical,

170
00:15:02.675 --> 00:15:04.969
the speculative, the fanciful.

171
00:15:05.094 --> 00:15:11.517
You are here to harness
your god-given talents,


172
00:15:11.642 --> 00:15:13.978
your minds, your energy,

173
00:15:14.103 --> 00:15:18.899
in the practical pursuit
of one thing:


174
00:15:19.025 --> 00:15:21.152
A military weapon.

175
00:15:21.277 --> 00:15:23.404
Nuclear one.

176
00:15:23.529 --> 00:15:25.573
An atomic bomb.

177
00:15:25.698 --> 00:15:30.745
Keep the muttering
to just a minimum, gentlemen.


178
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:34.415
Why bother with a bomb?
Why not just drop that man on Berlin?


179
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.793
- When you talk about it...
- It will have the same effect.


180
00:15:37.918 --> 00:15:43.090
it will be referred to as "the gadget"
or "the device".


181
00:15:43.215 --> 00:15:45.801
Is that clear?

182
00:15:46.802 --> 00:15:50.514
There is one word
that I don't want to hear.


183
00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:53.100
And that's the word "impossible".

184
00:15:53.225 --> 00:15:56.937
- You're two days late.
- I went to 109 East Palace Street


185
00:15:57.063 --> 00:16:00.816
to report to Mrs. McKibben,
but there was nobody there.


186
00:16:00.941 --> 00:16:06.947
So I hopped a construction bus, and it
damn near drove me back to Chicago.


187
00:16:07.073 --> 00:16:11.869
I've been sitting on trains, buses,

188
00:16:11.994 --> 00:16:17.124
railway stations for 60 hours.

189
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.879
I asked about this place in Santa Fe,
and they said it didn't exist.


190
00:16:22.004 --> 00:16:24.548
It doesn't.

191
00:16:28.427 --> 00:16:32.473
So where does a fellow
get some chow around here?


192
00:16:32.598 --> 00:16:36.185
- We already ate.
- Oh, great.


193
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.772
Oh, if you want to take a shower,
I'd take one now.


194
00:16:39.897 --> 00:16:43.693
They turn off the water at 2:00.

195
00:16:48.614 --> 00:16:52.868
Keep those two men back there.
We still got to run the power through.


196
00:16:52.994 --> 00:16:56.122
Yeah, you two men there!

197
00:16:58.249 --> 00:17:01.961
Higher! A little more.

198
00:17:02.294 --> 00:17:05.006
All right, that'll do it.

199
00:17:05.923 --> 00:17:08.884
Open this door, now!

200
00:17:09.969 --> 00:17:11.470
Sorry. I couldn't get in.

201
00:17:11.595 --> 00:17:15.057
Give it a month, you'll do that
because you can't get out.


202
00:17:15.182 --> 00:17:16.517
- You Merriman?
- Yeah.


203
00:17:16.642 --> 00:17:20.104
Richard Schoenfield.
I'm the doctor around here.


204
00:17:20.229 --> 00:17:25.109
You're just what I'm looking for
in a roommate, a little brute strength.


205
00:17:25.818 --> 00:17:27.778
Holy shit!

206
00:17:27.903 --> 00:17:31.365
- What in god's name is this?
- It looks like a fridge.


207
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.367
Oh, yeah, it does.

208
00:17:33.492 --> 00:17:35.328
It looks stuck.

209
00:17:35.453 --> 00:17:39.040
I guess you arrived just in time then.
Thank god you're here.


210
00:17:39.165 --> 00:17:42.084
Which end would you like?

211
00:17:46.922 --> 00:17:49.425
Are you ready?

212
00:17:50.009 --> 00:17:53.387
- You want me to get it myself?
- Lift.


213
00:18:04.523 --> 00:18:09.528
Oppie's boys.
No problem left unsolved.


214
00:18:10.363 --> 00:18:15.242
Gentlemen, this project
has been separated into three areas.


215
00:18:15.368 --> 00:18:17.787
The physics.
How much material do we need?


216
00:18:17.912 --> 00:18:20.748
Should it be plutonium
or uranium 235?


217
00:18:20.873 --> 00:18:24.377
Second, manufacture of material,
but that's out of our hands.


218
00:18:24.502 --> 00:18:27.546
That's Oak Ridge, Tennessee
and Hanford. And third,


219
00:18:27.672 --> 00:18:30.091
our responsibility,
and this is a cinch...


220
00:18:30.216 --> 00:18:31.926
Yeah, sure.

221
00:18:32.051 --> 00:18:36.389
build the device, test it,
and just hope that we can control it.


222
00:18:36.514 --> 00:18:39.558
Gentlemen, we are here...

223
00:18:40.476 --> 00:18:44.689
at the beginning.
Our objective is here.


224
00:18:44.814 --> 00:18:48.192
We have a deadline of 19 months.

225
00:18:50.486 --> 00:18:52.780
19 months?
It seems such a short time.


226
00:18:52.905 --> 00:18:56.200
19 months coincides
with our anticipated delivery date


227
00:18:56.325 --> 00:18:59.662
from Oak Ridge. Gentlemen,
we have 19 months, that's it...


228
00:18:59.787 --> 00:19:03.249
to box, wrap
and deliver this package.


229
00:19:03.374 --> 00:19:06.419
Are there any dissenters?

230
00:19:07.712 --> 00:19:09.880
No?

231
00:19:10.006 --> 00:19:11.549
Good.

232
00:19:11.674 --> 00:19:15.594
<i>Nineteen months
and starting from scratch, Jesus.</i>


233
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:20.349
<i>Still, Oppie's got the best theoreticians
and engineers in the world.</i>


234
00:19:20.474 --> 00:19:25.146
<i>Some of these guys are legends and
so young. The place is a hothouse.</i>


235
00:19:25.271 --> 00:19:27.815
<i>Doc, he seems like
he's gonna be a good man.</i>


236
00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.403
<i>Reckons we'll be working with funny stuff.
He's gonna be looking out for us.</i>


237
00:19:32.528 --> 00:19:36.532
<i>He's got a whole wing of the hospital
that looks like Noah's Ark.</i>


238
00:19:36.657 --> 00:19:40.703
<i>I think of Jimmy fighting in the
Philippines, and I can't complain.</i>


239
00:19:40.828 --> 00:19:44.332
<i>I love you, but I got to go.
General wants a progress report.</i>


240
00:19:44.457 --> 00:19:47.043
<i>When Groves wants something,
he wants it now.</i>


241
00:19:47.168 --> 00:19:49.628
Again.

242
00:19:50.588 --> 00:19:53.341
We build a cannon,
and at the end


243
00:19:53.466 --> 00:19:56.677
weld a stopper
made from a subcritical mass.


244
00:19:56.802 --> 00:20:00.973
We fabricate a shell
made from another subcritical mass


245
00:20:01.098 --> 00:20:03.934
and fire it down the barrel.

246
00:20:04.977 --> 00:20:07.938
- How much of both materials?
- Projecting 30 pounds.


247
00:20:08.064 --> 00:20:10.191
30 pounds is as far away
as the moon.


248
00:20:10.316 --> 00:20:13.486
<i>We're trying to tap the energy
that fuels the universe.</i>


249
00:20:13.611 --> 00:20:16.822
<i>It's petrifying. All we've got
so far are problems,</i>


250
00:20:16.947 --> 00:20:20.368
<i>and that doesn't include the ones
we haven't thought about.</i>


251
00:20:20.493 --> 00:20:23.329
Shake down the bad news.
I'm getting used to it.


252
00:20:23.454 --> 00:20:26.540
At the moment, there are
two problems. Pre-detonation.


253
00:20:26.666 --> 00:20:29.210
The gadget disintegrates
before it explodes.


254
00:20:29.335 --> 00:20:31.754
Second, it's the weight problem.

255
00:20:31.879 --> 00:20:34.590
For the slug to travel at the velocity
we need,


256
00:20:34.715 --> 00:20:37.218
the gun barrel
would be so heavy, so thick,


257
00:20:37.343 --> 00:20:41.055
I don't think we'd get the gadget
off the ground with a crane.


258
00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:44.600
If they're talking about a slug
with a seven-inch diameter,


259
00:20:44.725 --> 00:20:49.480
then you'd have to have a barrel
thickness of at least four inches.


260
00:20:55.319 --> 00:20:57.196
I hope you guys find the music.

261
00:20:57.321 --> 00:20:59.907
The way things are,
we can't even hum the tune.


262
00:21:00.032 --> 00:21:01.784
Free discussion.
Two groups...


263
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:04.328
- I'm not comfortable with...
- Excuse me.


264
00:21:04.453 --> 00:21:09.250
Seth, Deke, the gun barrel.
Robert, Michael, pre-detonation.


265
00:21:11.419 --> 00:21:16.007
Damn it! Just, damn it!
Maybe it's the altitude.


266
00:21:16.132 --> 00:21:18.592
But we're still just chalk
on a blackboard.


267
00:21:18.718 --> 00:21:20.803
We're dead in the water.

268
00:21:20.928 --> 00:21:24.390
Maybe we cast a lighter
gun barrel, find a new alloy.


269
00:21:24.515 --> 00:21:26.267
The force would be too great.

270
00:21:26.392 --> 00:21:30.771
We got to smack these atoms together
to trigger a chain reaction.


271
00:21:30.896 --> 00:21:35.109
We got to concentrate the energy
and crush the mass.


272
00:21:35.234 --> 00:21:37.278
All right, let's rethink this.

273
00:21:37.403 --> 00:21:41.198
We have a gun barrel that's so heavy
we can't lift it with a plane.


274
00:21:41.324 --> 00:21:44.702
To get the explosive power we need,
it's got to be heavy.


275
00:21:44.827 --> 00:21:47.580
Michael, come here!

276
00:21:47.913 --> 00:21:50.916
When I squeeze this...

277
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.169
- ...what do I get?
- Juice.


278
00:21:53.294 --> 00:21:57.798
No. I squeeze it, 
I get compression.

279
00:21:57.923 --> 00:22:00.301
We get a hollow sphere
of plutonium,


280
00:22:00.426 --> 00:22:03.804
and we compress it
with an explosion that goes in.


281
00:22:03.929 --> 00:22:06.307
- An implosion.
- Chain reaction.


282
00:22:06.432 --> 00:22:09.060
Boom!

283
00:22:09.477 --> 00:22:12.146
- But, Seth, explosives go out.
- I know.


284
00:22:12.271 --> 00:22:16.067
But we make one that goes in.

285
00:22:17.443 --> 00:22:19.195
Jesus.

286
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.155
- Michael.
- Let's get the boys.


287
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.449
We'll meet down here in the canteen.

288
00:22:23.574 --> 00:22:28.663
It's brilliant. The device is gonna be so
light that we don't need a gun barrel!


289
00:22:28.788 --> 00:22:32.750
Got a match, soldier?

290
00:22:42.968 --> 00:22:45.930
Sir, it's Michael and Seth!

291
00:22:47.807 --> 00:22:49.266
I'm sorry to bother you.

292
00:22:49.392 --> 00:22:52.395
But Seth had an idea.
He was thinking of an orange.


293
00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.856
Yes, I was thinking of jumping
up and down on an orange.


294
00:22:55.982 --> 00:22:57.984
- Crushing an orange.
- Crushing!


295
00:22:58.109 --> 00:23:01.278
Crushing... the core.

296
00:23:01.404 --> 00:23:04.240
Oh, god.
This could be very sweet.


297
00:23:04.365 --> 00:23:08.035
- Where are the others?
- Canteen, they want to kick it around.


298
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.372
- Perhaps it can wait till later?
- No, you go ahead.


299
00:23:11.497 --> 00:23:15.167
- I'd have lost you anyway.
- Thank you.


300
00:23:21.173 --> 00:23:24.260
Goddamn it.

301
00:23:37.106 --> 00:23:39.692
Doctor!

302
00:23:45.698 --> 00:23:47.783
- Come on!
- Double up, over here!


303
00:23:47.908 --> 00:23:51.787
I'm sorry. We were looking for testing
sites and the bus got stuck.


304
00:23:51.912 --> 00:23:56.042
You had a meeting last night.
You discussed the work in public.


305
00:23:56.167 --> 00:23:58.336
We were discussing
Neddermeyer's...


306
00:23:58.461 --> 00:24:01.380
- In public!
- A table in the back of the canteen.


307
00:24:01.505 --> 00:24:05.259
- We were having a free discussion.
- Let's just talk about that.


308
00:24:05.384 --> 00:24:08.804
I don't want free discussion.
I want compartmentalization.


309
00:24:08.929 --> 00:24:12.808
I don't want theoreticians
knowing what engineers know.


310
00:24:12.933 --> 00:24:16.437
- Listen to me...
- It is a security problem!


311
00:24:16.562 --> 00:24:20.274
These kids are used to pinning
their best ideas on a board.


312
00:24:20.399 --> 00:24:24.320
Ideas are community property.
It's a matter of principle.


313
00:24:24.445 --> 00:24:27.907
You force my hand and there
won't be any free discussion


314
00:24:28.032 --> 00:24:31.619
because there won't be anybody left
to have it!


315
00:24:31.744 --> 00:24:35.873
If you'd been there you'd understand.
Neddermeyer's idea was brilliant.


316
00:24:35.998 --> 00:24:37.833
An explosion that goes inwards,

317
00:24:37.958 --> 00:24:41.671
producing uniform compression
in a core and it'd be lightweight.


318
00:24:41.796 --> 00:24:44.632
No gun barrel,
no velocity and weight problem.


319
00:24:44.757 --> 00:24:47.468
And all of that
out of free discussion.


320
00:24:47.593 --> 00:24:50.971
You've got to give us room
to breathe.


321
00:24:52.056 --> 00:24:54.767
- Bronson?
- Sir?


322
00:24:54.892 --> 00:24:58.270
Just don't give it
to the waitresses.


323
00:25:06.445 --> 00:25:08.614
<i>Oppie's quite a match
for the general.</i>


324
00:25:08.739 --> 00:25:13.327
<i>I'm worried it's not in Groves' nature
to rest until he gets the upper hand.</i>


325
00:25:13.452 --> 00:25:15.663
<i>We're terrified the Germans
are ahead.</i>


326
00:25:15.788 --> 00:25:19.667
<i>Working with restrictions and
regulations is setting us on edge.</i>


327
00:25:19.792 --> 00:25:23.295
This is typical.
We are people, not numbers!


328
00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:25.715
It's not part of the agreement,
general.


329
00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.093
I apologize for complaints,
but barbed wire,


330
00:25:29.218 --> 00:25:31.012
dogs, guards!

331
00:25:31.137 --> 00:25:33.389
- Security badges!
- Secrets!


332
00:25:33.514 --> 00:25:36.642
I hoped to leave these things in Italy
with Mussolini!


333
00:25:36.767 --> 00:25:39.687
Openness is a principle
matter for scientists!


334
00:25:39.812 --> 00:25:43.983
And there are many other things.
I resent my letters are being censored.


335
00:25:44.108 --> 00:25:48.029
The FBI talking to me, that's one
thing. But my wife, my family,


336
00:25:48.154 --> 00:25:51.198
that's a little much.
Don't you think?


337
00:25:51.324 --> 00:25:54.618
We cannot continue work
under these conditions!


338
00:25:54.744 --> 00:25:57.997
- Doctor.
- And what about...


339
00:26:08.341 --> 00:26:12.762
Well, that is some monkey house
in there.


340
00:26:12.887 --> 00:26:15.389
A mess.
What are you gonna do about it?


341
00:26:15.514 --> 00:26:18.476
I warned you about this.

342
00:26:19.727 --> 00:26:24.231
Look, you give me responsibility
for security inside the lab.


343
00:26:24.357 --> 00:26:26.901
We go where we like, as we like,
when we like.


344
00:26:27.026 --> 00:26:30.112
Outside the lab, that's yours.

345
00:26:30.237 --> 00:26:33.532
I will sell them on that.

346
00:26:34.325 --> 00:26:41.082
I don't like it.
But I will live with it, for now.


347
00:26:48.255 --> 00:26:49.924
<i>The 8th Air Force today</i>

348
00:26:50.049 --> 00:26:54.470
<i>carried out its heaviest bombing
of the war against Germany.</i>


349
00:26:54.595 --> 00:26:58.099
Michael! Michael. What do you say?
Good to see you.


350
00:26:58.224 --> 00:27:01.143
- How are you?
- I brought Kathleen with me.


351
00:27:01.268 --> 00:27:05.439
I was afraid this party would be
a little short on the beauty side,


352
00:27:05.564 --> 00:27:10.611
so I took the appropriate precautions,
if you know what I'm saying.


353
00:27:10.736 --> 00:27:15.449
- I mean, she is my favorite nurse.
- You two gonna get together?


354
00:27:16.742 --> 00:27:20.788
No. No, we're not.
Actually, I'm gonna get a drink.


355
00:27:20.913 --> 00:27:27.003
That's what I'm gonna get. A good
stiff drink, that's all I'm gonna get.


356
00:27:29.547 --> 00:27:32.550
- Two bucks...
- It's a short bet.


357
00:27:34.135 --> 00:27:35.928
- Like I said...
- This is stuck.


358
00:27:36.053 --> 00:27:39.306
it can be pretty lonely here.

359
00:27:39.432 --> 00:27:41.308
There's a war on.

360
00:27:41.434 --> 00:27:45.312
Not everybody can go to Acapulco.

361
00:27:51.444 --> 00:27:55.281
- Oh, my.
- Are you OK?


362
00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:00.328
Good.
Thank you.


363
00:28:00.453 --> 00:28:03.914
Look, they're perfect.

364
00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.335
Another minute,
they would have been overdone.


365
00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.754
Well, I'll put this in the sink.

366
00:28:09.879 --> 00:28:13.007
- Would you like some orange juice?
- Yes, kindly.


367
00:28:13.132 --> 00:28:18.596
- I am sorry.
- Oh, don't worry about it.


368
00:28:18.721 --> 00:28:23.392
- This will be taken care of.
- It's OK.


369
00:28:24.226 --> 00:28:29.231
Anyway, I'm sure
we're going to be allies, general.


370
00:28:29.357 --> 00:28:32.610
We're both trying to seduce
the same man.


371
00:28:37.948 --> 00:28:41.202
So is there a Mrs. Groves?

372
00:28:41.369 --> 00:28:45.331
Yes, there is.

373
00:28:45.915 --> 00:28:49.210
And she has the courage
to stay in the background.


374
00:28:49.335 --> 00:28:53.381
Some men are on the planet
for a purpose, Mrs. Oppenheimer.


375
00:28:53.506 --> 00:28:59.470
A good wife recognizes that
and is happy to smooth the way.


376
00:29:03.015 --> 00:29:05.810
Read my theory
on degenerate matter, did you?


377
00:29:05.935 --> 00:29:08.938
It didn't generate
much enthusiasm elsewhere.


378
00:29:09.063 --> 00:29:12.942
But what do you think we'll find
at the end of the tunnel, Michael?


379
00:29:13.067 --> 00:29:17.321
- A martini.
- Probably.


380
00:29:37.091 --> 00:29:41.679
<i>- Operator.</i>
- Berkeley 5558, please.


381
00:29:45.057 --> 00:29:48.185
Hello, Jean. It's me.

382
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:53.607
- Jean, I know you're there.
<i>- I'd given up waiting.</i>


383
00:29:53.733 --> 00:29:56.277
I'm sorry.
I wasn't able to manage...


384
00:29:56.402 --> 00:29:58.904
<i>Oppie, I've been so frightened.</i>

385
00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:02.158
<i>You don't phone. You don't write.
Not even a message.</i>


386
00:30:02.283 --> 00:30:04.118
<i>- I can't.
- You can't?</i>


387
00:30:04.243 --> 00:30:06.954
<i>No, Jean, I can't.</i>

388
00:30:07.079 --> 00:30:08.748
<i>- Are you coming?
- Well...</i>


389
00:30:08.873 --> 00:30:12.501
<i>- When are you coming?
- Jean.</i>


390
00:30:13.377 --> 00:30:16.380
<i>This isn't talking.
This is just making noises.</i>


391
00:30:16.505 --> 00:30:18.758
<i>Why don't we just grunt
at each other?</i>


392
00:30:18.883 --> 00:30:21.677
<i>- "I got to run. There's a war to win."
- Jean.</i>


393
00:30:21.802 --> 00:30:25.306
<i>I can't remember a day
I wasn't hurting, except with you.</i>


394
00:30:25.431 --> 00:30:30.061
Jean, listen to me.
You've got to understand, please.


395
00:30:55.711 --> 00:30:58.130
Yes?

396
00:30:59.298 --> 00:31:01.217
I won't keep you, general.

397
00:31:01.342 --> 00:31:03.010
Well, you better had.

398
00:31:03.135 --> 00:31:07.014
Banging on my door
at 2:00 in the morning.


399
00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:12.895
I had this typed up, sir.
I thought you'd want to see it.


400
00:31:15.815 --> 00:31:19.193
She's working him over, general.
I've seen this before.


401
00:31:19.318 --> 00:31:21.904
That grunting at each other,
could be a code.


402
00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:25.491
- The cipher clerk said it's not code.
- Who is this woman?


403
00:31:25.616 --> 00:31:29.036
Jean Tatlock, sir.
She's a known communist.


404
00:31:29.161 --> 00:31:31.956
Get me her background.

405
00:31:32.081 --> 00:31:36.460
And maybe I am missing some stuff
on the good doctor.


406
00:31:36.585 --> 00:31:38.587
- Get it for me.
- Yes, sir.


407
00:31:38.713 --> 00:31:42.717
This must throw Oppenheimer's
position on this project into doubt, sir.


408
00:31:42.842 --> 00:31:46.721
- Dr. Oppenheimer is the project.
- Yes, sir.


409
00:31:46.846 --> 00:31:51.434
All due respect, sir, though, doesn't
this make him an unacceptable risk?


410
00:31:51.559 --> 00:31:55.354
No! Failure's a risk.

411
00:31:56.188 --> 00:32:01.152
The thing that concerns me is,
if he's with her, he's not with us.


412
00:32:04.447 --> 00:32:07.742
It might be a good time
to put the screws to the doctor.


413
00:32:07.867 --> 00:32:11.078
Yes, sir. May I ask,
how do you intend to do that, sir?


414
00:32:11.203 --> 00:32:14.498
No, colonel, you may not.

415
00:32:40.858 --> 00:32:44.278
- Compression not uniform.
- Stand by!


416
00:32:44.403 --> 00:32:48.199
If we had a thinner wall, we could
increase the compression, yes?


417
00:32:48.324 --> 00:32:50.076
Seth, there's an answer here.

418
00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:52.745
Oppie, maybe implosion's
just a blind alley.


419
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:54.664
- Are we going again?
- Yes!


420
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:59.043
- That's an excuse for not thinking...
- We'll get reset.


421
00:33:00.878 --> 00:33:04.590
All clear!
Reset the charges!


422
00:33:04.715 --> 00:33:07.593
Reset the charges!

423
00:33:07.718 --> 00:33:10.805
- We got all clear! Let's go!
- Let's move!


424
00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:16.018
- Move it!
- On the double! On the double! Go!


425
00:33:16.352 --> 00:33:20.022
- Move it! Move it!
- Bring it in! Left side! Left side!


426
00:33:20.147 --> 00:33:22.274
Come on!
Get the lead out!


427
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.987
On the double, guys!
Let's go!


428
00:33:26.404 --> 00:33:28.698
Canyon to Los Alamos.

429
00:33:31.575 --> 00:33:33.494
Come in, Los Alamos.

430
00:33:33.619 --> 00:33:36.580
Canyon to Los Alamos.

431
00:33:39.709 --> 00:33:42.795
Come in, Los Alamos. Come in.

432
00:33:43.879 --> 00:33:47.800
- Something set off the detonators.
- Stay back! They're wired in series.


433
00:33:47.925 --> 00:33:50.511
Get out of there!

434
00:33:55.766 --> 00:33:58.144
- No, Oppie.
- Shit.


435
00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:14.118
It's all right.

436
00:34:15.911 --> 00:34:18.581
Take it easy, brother.

437
00:34:22.126 --> 00:34:24.503
Thanks a lot.

438
00:34:25.296 --> 00:34:27.506
Do me a favor.
Jump in the ambulance.


439
00:34:27.631 --> 00:34:29.342
Let me give you
the once-over.


440
00:34:29.467 --> 00:34:33.429
You guys are playing
with some funny stuff out here.


441
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:39.226
Let's go. Start them up.

442
00:34:51.656 --> 00:34:54.909
Did they teach you that at high school?

443
00:34:55.493 --> 00:34:58.412
You took a risk.

444
00:34:58.788 --> 00:35:01.749
I ran out and grabbed the guy.
I didn't even think.


445
00:35:01.874 --> 00:35:05.753
- Just instinct.
- Instinct?


446
00:35:07.254 --> 00:35:09.590
You know, I wonder,
with this war...


447
00:35:09.715 --> 00:35:13.552
if it's instinct to save a man,
what makes us want to kill one?


448
00:35:13.678 --> 00:35:16.514
Is that instinct?

449
00:35:18.099 --> 00:35:20.184
You sound like my old man.

450
00:35:20.309 --> 00:35:21.686
Why, what's he like?

451
00:35:21.811 --> 00:35:24.897
- My old man?
- Yeah.


452
00:35:25.356 --> 00:35:28.025
He's a preacher.

453
00:35:28.234 --> 00:35:30.987
In Jackson, Illinois.

454
00:35:31.112 --> 00:35:35.241
And I got an older brother,
Jimmy, and he's a soldier.


455
00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:37.493
My mom's dead.

456
00:35:37.618 --> 00:35:42.081
I don't know, I guess he's kind of
hurt that I'm not at the front.


457
00:35:42.206 --> 00:35:44.917
- Why?
- Well, Jackson is a small town.


458
00:35:45.042 --> 00:35:48.462
- He said, "Where you going?"
- I said, "Santa Fe, New Mexico."


459
00:35:48.587 --> 00:35:53.050
- I know.
- So that didn't quite hack it.


460
00:35:53.175 --> 00:35:55.636
He said,
"If you're not gonna be a soldier,


461
00:35:55.761 --> 00:35:58.472
you better be a good scientist.
The best."


462
00:35:58.597 --> 00:36:03.185
- Are you the best?
- I was in Chicago.


463
00:36:03.394 --> 00:36:06.063
But these guys are so bright.

464
00:36:06.439 --> 00:36:08.941
Sometimes I feel like
I'm in over my head.


465
00:36:09.066 --> 00:36:13.029
But I guess I can handle
anything they throw at me.


466
00:36:13.988 --> 00:36:15.906
But can you dance?

467
00:36:16.032 --> 00:36:18.367
Pardon me?

468
00:36:19.285 --> 00:36:22.371
I said, can you dance?

469
00:36:22.496 --> 00:36:26.125
- Yeah.
- Well, do it.


470
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:30.171
- Are you serious?
- Can't handle it?


471
00:36:53.819 --> 00:36:56.489
Very nice.

472
00:37:06.457 --> 00:37:10.086
- Something like that.
- Very good.


473
00:37:32.692 --> 00:37:35.820
Jean Tatlock, graduated in 1932.

474
00:37:35.945 --> 00:37:39.240
They had a thing together
before Oppenheimer was married.


475
00:37:39.365 --> 00:37:41.033
Seems Tatlock ran off.

476
00:37:41.158 --> 00:37:44.328
Things went on the back burner
between them till 1942.


477
00:37:44.453 --> 00:37:46.205
Then it all started up again.

478
00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:50.710
His associate said, "If the wife's
his ambition, Tatlock's his conscience."


479
00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:55.047
She introduced him to a number of
anti-fascist groups, anti-Franco groups


480
00:37:55.172 --> 00:37:56.757
and a number of communists.

481
00:37:56.882 --> 00:37:58.217
- Bronson.
- Sir.


482
00:37:58.342 --> 00:38:02.096
Little less muscle on the gas here.
Colonel's starting a mission.


483
00:38:02.221 --> 00:38:03.723
I'd like him alive.

484
00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:05.141
Yes, sir.

485
00:38:05.266 --> 00:38:08.269
This makes Oppenheimer
a sitting duck for blackmail.


486
00:38:08.394 --> 00:38:10.855
I'm gonna insist on his removal.

487
00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.399
No, you're not. Just relax.

488
00:38:13.524 --> 00:38:18.237
You know, major, if you want
to lead a man in a certain direction,


489
00:38:18.362 --> 00:38:21.407
you don't drag him by the nose.

490
00:38:21.532 --> 00:38:23.451
You just close off his options.

491
00:38:23.576 --> 00:38:26.620
Simple as a truck.

492
00:38:30.708 --> 00:38:32.668
<i>Here we are
in the top of the ninth.</i>


493
00:38:32.793 --> 00:38:36.088
<i>The Army down
to the Scientists by one run.</i>


494
00:38:36.505 --> 00:38:40.217
<i>Dugan shakes it off.
Here's Merriman's pitch.</i>


495
00:38:40.343 --> 00:38:42.053
<i>That's a hit.</i>

496
00:38:42.178 --> 00:38:44.972
<i>Dugan digging for first base,
gonna go for two.</i>


497
00:38:45.097 --> 00:38:48.726
<i>Look out. Here's the throw.
Safe at second base on a slide.</i>


498
00:38:48.851 --> 00:38:52.563
<i>Apple scores.
That ties the game.</i>


499
00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:01.822
Yes?

500
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:05.368
Yes?

501
00:39:08.704 --> 00:39:10.289
Bad time?

502
00:39:10.414 --> 00:39:14.877
The velocity's still presenting us
with something of a problem.


503
00:39:18.047 --> 00:39:22.093
Who's this bimbo
you're running around with?


504
00:39:22.802 --> 00:39:26.472
- What?
- Do I have to tell you?


505
00:39:26.597 --> 00:39:29.475
I got it on the q.t.
from somebody who owes me.


506
00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.811
What if the next guy
doesn't owe me?


507
00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:34.647
Takes that kind of information
to the wrong guy?


508
00:39:34.772 --> 00:39:39.986
That could be the end of you.
Could be the end of this project.


509
00:39:40.403 --> 00:39:42.655
I don't understand you.

510
00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:47.618
You think you're some kind
of bohemian or something.


511
00:39:50.705 --> 00:39:53.541
Blind-sided.

512
00:39:53.916 --> 00:39:58.212
I never expected to get
blind-sided like this.


513
00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:12.393
Doctor, might I be of assistance?

514
00:40:12.518 --> 00:40:16.063
What about me in all this?
This looks bad.


515
00:40:16.188 --> 00:40:19.859
Reflects on me.
Reflects on my ability to choose men.


516
00:40:19.984 --> 00:40:24.530
I was with this woman before
this project. This is not a new thing.


517
00:40:24.655 --> 00:40:26.532
It's no matter.

518
00:40:26.657 --> 00:40:31.662
I am not comfortable with the idea
that you could sink me.


519
00:40:35.499 --> 00:40:37.460
This is someone that I care about.

520
00:40:37.585 --> 00:40:40.629
She's a communist.

521
00:40:41.339 --> 00:40:43.632
A communist.

522
00:40:43.841 --> 00:40:45.343
Oh, my god.

523
00:40:45.468 --> 00:40:48.179
It would be bad enough if she
were just some...


524
00:40:48.304 --> 00:40:50.181
sweet young thing from Indiana.

525
00:40:50.306 --> 00:40:52.933
She's a card-carrying communist.

526
00:40:53.059 --> 00:40:57.563
And your job, classified job.
What do I have to do, draw you a map?


527
00:40:57.688 --> 00:41:01.484
Get on the phone, a secure line,
tell her... goodbye!


528
00:41:04.362 --> 00:41:08.407
<i>It's out of there! It's gone!
Home run for Merriman.</i>


529
00:41:08.532 --> 00:41:10.660
Home run!

530
00:41:12.328 --> 00:41:15.247
- It's all right, Bronson, we'll live.
- Yes, sir.


531
00:41:15.373 --> 00:41:17.917
<i>Well, that's it, folks,
Scientists win the game.</i>


532
00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:20.461
It's in your court.

533
00:41:33.599 --> 00:41:37.728
Bridges, next time keep your head up.

534
00:41:38.646 --> 00:41:41.649
<i>All hail the conquering hero.</i>

535
00:41:41.941 --> 00:41:45.569
<i>Pencil pushers defeat
the doughboys.</i>


536
00:42:34.243 --> 00:42:36.329
Robert!

537
00:42:39.248 --> 00:42:42.585
- Frank.
- Good to see you, bro.


538
00:42:42.793 --> 00:42:45.755
- Are we being followed or something?
- Don't joke.


539
00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.299
I nearly asked you for your ID.

540
00:42:48.424 --> 00:42:52.845
- That's ridiculous.
- Let's just leave as soon as we can.


541
00:43:01.312 --> 00:43:04.899
They've been hounding me
for names of every person I've known


542
00:43:05.024 --> 00:43:07.026
who had communist sympathies.

543
00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:11.072
They monitor every move I make.
They listen to my phone conversations.


544
00:43:11.197 --> 00:43:12.782
Why stay?

545
00:43:12.907 --> 00:43:14.909
There's an order to it.

546
00:43:15.034 --> 00:43:18.079
An order in some part of my life,
at least.


547
00:43:18.204 --> 00:43:21.791
I'm sorry, I didn't get your message
till about 5.


548
00:43:21.916 --> 00:43:27.046
I was still at the hospital, and I got
all whizzed up into a huge panic.


549
00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:28.881
You look wonderful.

550
00:43:29.006 --> 00:43:32.510
You look so serious.
What's the matter?


551
00:43:33.344 --> 00:43:36.222
I don't have much time.
I have to go back tonight.


552
00:43:36.347 --> 00:43:37.932
Tonight?

553
00:43:38.057 --> 00:43:40.851
I cooked us dinner.

554
00:43:47.525 --> 00:43:50.861
This can't be about dinner, Jean.

555
00:43:52.238 --> 00:43:55.616
I didn't want to tell you
on the telephone.


556
00:43:56.033 --> 00:43:59.120
And that's why I'm here tonight.

557
00:44:06.877 --> 00:44:10.381
Is it because of what you're doing?

558
00:44:18.931 --> 00:44:21.559
Fine.

559
00:44:21.684 --> 00:44:26.522
We're going to spill the blood
before we get to the cocktails.


560
00:44:38.951 --> 00:44:41.454
Jean?

561
00:44:42.371 --> 00:44:46.667
Please... stay tonight.

562
00:44:46.792 --> 00:44:50.713
Please.

563
00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:58.304
Please.

564
00:45:23.162 --> 00:45:26.666
What you're working on,
it's something bad, isn't it?


565
00:45:26.791 --> 00:45:28.834
That's why you can't tell me.

566
00:45:28.959 --> 00:45:32.296
I can't tell you
because it's a secret.


567
00:45:32.421 --> 00:45:35.383
Tell me one good thing
that's a secret.


568
00:45:35.508 --> 00:45:38.260
We were a good thing.

569
00:45:38.636 --> 00:45:40.179
No, we weren't.

570
00:45:40.304 --> 00:45:43.265
Not when you got married.

571
00:45:43.599 --> 00:45:46.811
Give me up for something
I can understand.


572
00:45:46.936 --> 00:45:49.522
Your wife or your child
or your conscience,


573
00:45:49.647 --> 00:45:51.399
something alive.

574
00:45:51.524 --> 00:45:54.860
Not something
that you have to hide.


575
00:45:54.986 --> 00:45:57.405
Robert.

576
00:46:31.355 --> 00:46:35.234
Oh, Robert, I dreamt you'd gone.

577
00:46:41.741 --> 00:46:45.077
So that's what the silences were.

578
00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:48.497
No letters, no contact.

579
00:46:49.373 --> 00:46:52.084
I thought it was me,
something I'd done.


580
00:46:52.209 --> 00:46:57.256
- I've told you it has nothing to do...
- Yes, but you didn't tell me...


581
00:46:58.716 --> 00:47:01.927
What is it you're working on?
What is so important?


582
00:47:02.053 --> 00:47:04.597
That's right. It is important.

583
00:47:04.722 --> 00:47:07.016
So don't be so goddamn arrogant.

584
00:47:07.141 --> 00:47:09.852
Is it arrogant to want
to know where you are?


585
00:47:09.977 --> 00:47:14.690
What's happening to you? To want
to be close to you? To understand?


586
00:47:17.526 --> 00:47:19.945
This was the man I loved.

587
00:47:20.071 --> 00:47:23.532
I loved his dreams.
I loved what he saw but couldn't prove.


588
00:47:23.658 --> 00:47:26.452
I loved the goodness in him.

589
00:47:26.577 --> 00:47:31.040
He was my proof that the world
could be made better.


590
00:47:31.165 --> 00:47:34.502
And if he's dead, 
I don't want to live.

591
00:47:36.253 --> 00:47:40.841
The world is... different.

592
00:47:41.133 --> 00:47:43.511
It's just not what we
wanted it to be.


593
00:47:43.636 --> 00:47:46.180
It's just not.

594
00:47:52.728 --> 00:47:56.440
You mattered to me so much.

595
00:47:56.774 --> 00:47:59.860
You really did.

596
00:48:11.872 --> 00:48:16.002
She told me that I had
a penchant for destruction.


597
00:48:16.127 --> 00:48:18.713
That I'd lost faith.

598
00:48:18.838 --> 00:48:21.173
Is she wrong?

599
00:48:21.298 --> 00:48:22.967
No.

600
00:48:23.092 --> 00:48:25.386
She's not wrong.

601
00:48:27.555 --> 00:48:31.100
When this war's over, I want
to ride the mesa for six months.


602
00:48:31.225 --> 00:48:33.477
No deadlines.

603
00:48:33.602 --> 00:48:35.771
Nothing.

604
00:48:40.318 --> 00:48:41.986
Thanks, Frank.

605
00:48:42.111 --> 00:48:44.280
He just kissed his brother.

606
00:48:44.405 --> 00:48:47.116
Got to be a communist.

607
00:49:02.673 --> 00:49:05.593
Set that over there.

608
00:49:08.262 --> 00:49:11.390
Look at it, Oppie, it's twisted.
It's got to be flat.


609
00:49:11.515 --> 00:49:15.978
I think implosion's nothing but a pipe
dream. I'm sorry I thought of it.


610
00:49:16.103 --> 00:49:18.272
I can't do it.

611
00:49:18.397 --> 00:49:22.443
Oppie, some way I have to focus...
I have to focus the shock waves.


612
00:49:22.568 --> 00:49:24.987
Look at me!
God, I'm running out of ideas.


613
00:49:25.112 --> 00:49:29.075
That's an excuse for not thinking.
If you can't, I'll find somebody else.


614
00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.411
Oppie? Serber needs
you back at the lab right now.


615
00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:34.580
- Oppie?
- You said it yourself.


616
00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:38.668
Focus. Somebody's working on a way
to focus an explosive shock wave.


617
00:49:38.793 --> 00:49:42.421
- I'm gonna find him. Keep working.
- Jesus!


618
00:49:47.927 --> 00:49:53.015
You know, if Oppie doesn't let up,
he's going to implode.


619
00:50:04.944 --> 00:50:08.197
Inside. Inside.

620
00:50:11.784 --> 00:50:15.329
Good news is the new plutonium
makes lots of neutrons.


621
00:50:15.454 --> 00:50:19.375
But the bad news is the spontaneous
fission rate is way too high.


622
00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:23.295
The reaction will run away with itself.
There will just be a fizzle.


623
00:50:23.421 --> 00:50:26.632
- No explosion.
- You're certain of that, Edward?


624
00:50:26.757 --> 00:50:28.884
- Who did the calculations?
- Serber.


625
00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:32.096
- Himself?
- Serber, personally.


626
00:50:32.221 --> 00:50:36.892
So now plutonium is a problem. That
shifts the emphasis back to U-235.


627
00:50:37.018 --> 00:50:41.188
Of course, Oak Ridge is not able
to produce that in sufficient quantity.


628
00:50:41.314 --> 00:50:44.900
We must go with implosion, but
Neddermeyer has just announced to me


629
00:50:45.026 --> 00:50:49.322
that he and implosion
have just reached a brick wall.


630
00:50:51.866 --> 00:50:54.452
We can't fall behind.

631
00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:58.039
Are you all right, Oppie?

632
00:50:58.164 --> 00:51:00.499
You have a deadline to meet.

633
00:51:01.334 --> 00:51:06.172
Banked almost a billion dollars on you
guys. That's not working on the cheap.


634
00:51:06.297 --> 00:51:08.799
The only thing I want to hear
from you is, "Yes, sir."


635
00:51:08.924 --> 00:51:13.137
Don't talk to me like I haven't given
eight days a week to this project.


636
00:51:13.262 --> 00:51:14.930
I've given up everything.

637
00:51:15.056 --> 00:51:17.141
Don't... don't give me that.

638
00:51:17.266 --> 00:51:19.393
I don't want to hear
that from the...


639
00:51:19.518 --> 00:51:21.354
I've given up everything.

640
00:51:21.479 --> 00:51:24.649
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.


641
00:51:24.774 --> 00:51:27.652
I don't give a goddamn
that travel was restricted.


642
00:51:27.777 --> 00:51:32.281
It had to be done face to face,
and that's the way I did it.


643
00:51:37.161 --> 00:51:40.289
<i>Latest news
from the fighting front.</i>


644
00:51:42.208 --> 00:51:45.878
<i>American armies are pushing the
Germans back on their own territory.</i>


645
00:51:46.003 --> 00:51:47.588
<i>But fighting is desperate.</i>

646
00:51:47.713 --> 00:51:51.008
<i>The Germans are building up
for a massive counter thrust.</i>


647
00:51:51.133 --> 00:51:54.303
<i>Though the Allies are determined
to hold this new front...</i>


648
00:51:54.428 --> 00:51:55.721
Who's the Lone Ranger?

649
00:51:55.846 --> 00:51:58.015
Explosives wiz.
I don't know about Tonto.


650
00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:00.726
<i>Neddermeyer gave up
on his explosion that goes in.</i>


651
00:52:00.851 --> 00:52:02.186
<i>Not Oppie, though.</i>

652
00:52:02.311 --> 00:52:05.523
<i>He brought in two explosive
experts from the outside.</i>


653
00:52:05.648 --> 00:52:07.984
<i>We struggle on here
in our isolation.</i>


654
00:52:08.109 --> 00:52:12.154
<i>And sometimes the war
seems a long way away.</i>


655
00:52:16.659 --> 00:52:18.369
You want a ride, doc?

656
00:52:18.494 --> 00:52:22.665
Hey, Seth. When did you
get your driver's license?


657
00:52:25.459 --> 00:52:28.004
- You come to see the boys at play?
- Yes.


658
00:52:28.129 --> 00:52:30.423
- Oh, bad news, beautiful.
- Oh, no.


659
00:52:30.548 --> 00:52:33.300
I'm not gonna be able to make
that movie tonight.


660
00:52:33.426 --> 00:52:36.971
I can join you both for a drink.
It would make you happy.


661
00:52:37.096 --> 00:52:39.557
- Sound good?
- Perfect.


662
00:52:39.682 --> 00:52:42.018
Right, right.

663
00:52:42.143 --> 00:52:46.147
Well, I promised the monkey
we'd be cutting a rug anyway.


664
00:52:46.272 --> 00:52:48.733
It's just as well.

665
00:52:48.858 --> 00:52:51.819
Michael, what's wrong with you?

666
00:52:52.486 --> 00:52:54.238
Do you see much of him?

667
00:52:54.363 --> 00:52:57.074
Yes, I like him.

668
00:53:00.328 --> 00:53:02.663
Are you jealous?

669
00:53:04.749 --> 00:53:06.876
Yeah.

670
00:53:08.377 --> 00:53:11.047
You better do something about it.

671
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:27.229
Tell them I ain't buying.
White House said


672
00:53:27.355 --> 00:53:31.025
there wouldn't be
any account till after the war.


673
00:53:32.193 --> 00:53:34.570
It's so damn tough
to get through to you,


674
00:53:34.695 --> 00:53:36.947
I decided to bring
you my problem.


675
00:53:37.073 --> 00:53:40.493
See the tread on that tire?
Because I sure as hell don't.


676
00:53:40.618 --> 00:53:43.996
Yet that's what my men
are riding around on.


677
00:53:44.205 --> 00:53:47.833
I don't know what kind of deal
you got yourself into, Groves,


678
00:53:47.958 --> 00:53:50.711
but I do care when it cuts
in on my territory.


679
00:53:50.836 --> 00:53:54.548
If I'm gonna move supplies around
the country, I need trucks.


680
00:53:54.674 --> 00:53:56.801
Those trucks run on tires, Dick.

681
00:53:56.926 --> 00:54:01.138
When I hear they ain't moving because
of some tire shortage, I get mad.


682
00:54:01.263 --> 00:54:04.225
When I hear you're the cause
of it, I want to kill.


683
00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:08.354
- We got to work something...
- No dice. We got a triple-A priority.


684
00:54:08.479 --> 00:54:12.441
White House authority.
We need the product.


685
00:54:14.151 --> 00:54:16.195
You need to know something.

686
00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:19.156
You're getting a lot
of people's backs up.


687
00:54:19.281 --> 00:54:21.951
Let me remind you of something else.
See this?


688
00:54:22.076 --> 00:54:23.995
I count two. You got one.

689
00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:27.873
When this war's over,
that will amount to something.


690
00:54:30.835 --> 00:54:33.713
And, Dick, I hope you get my meaning.

691
00:54:33.838 --> 00:54:36.841
Because, by all that's holy...

692
00:54:36.966 --> 00:54:40.136
you better have
your ass well-covered.


693
00:54:50.479 --> 00:54:52.857
- Well, Bronson.
- Sir?


694
00:54:52.982 --> 00:54:55.860
- It's all about ass, isn't it?
- Sir?


695
00:54:55.985 --> 00:54:58.529
You kick it or you lick it.

696
00:54:58.654 --> 00:55:01.365
That's what it's all about.

697
00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:03.701
I'm sorry about
my language, Bronson.


698
00:55:03.826 --> 00:55:06.329
But I'm on the limb.

699
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:09.373
My prima donnas
better come through...


700
00:55:09.498 --> 00:55:12.918
or you are looking
at a piece of dead meat.


701
00:55:13.044 --> 00:55:15.171
Yes, sir.

702
00:55:25.765 --> 00:55:28.601
- What's this?
- I don't know, sir.


703
00:55:28.726 --> 00:55:30.227
God, almighty.

704
00:55:30.353 --> 00:55:32.146
Is this a stop?

705
00:55:32.271 --> 00:55:35.858
What time is it?
There's no scheduled stop here.


706
00:55:45.034 --> 00:55:48.120
Message for General Groves.

707
00:55:48.537 --> 00:55:53.084
- I'll see what the problem is, sir.
- Message for General Groves.


708
00:55:53.209 --> 00:55:56.754
- Message for General Groves.
- In this way.


709
00:56:01.884 --> 00:56:04.303
General Groves, sir.
This is from Germany.


710
00:56:04.428 --> 00:56:08.015
It was flown in. We wired
ahead to have the train stopped.


711
00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:10.893
Excuse me, gentlemen.

712
00:56:24.865 --> 00:56:28.411
- Colonel.
- General.


713
00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:34.542
Put it in my safe, in the back.

714
00:56:34.667 --> 00:56:36.752
Don't bring it out.

715
00:56:38.921 --> 00:56:41.841
That means the Germans don't
have the bomb. Weren't close.


716
00:56:41.966 --> 00:56:45.928
Sir, is it wise?
I mean, suppressing this?


717
00:56:46.345 --> 00:56:49.015
Well, you tell me, colonel.

718
00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:51.767
It's delicate stuff.

719
00:56:53.102 --> 00:56:55.855
I'm talking about my longhairs,
my prima donnas.


720
00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:58.232
The jewish element.

721
00:56:58.357 --> 00:57:02.653
Take Hitler out of the equation...
they might just run out of stink.


722
00:57:02.778 --> 00:57:05.489
Why chance it?

723
00:57:05.614 --> 00:57:09.160
We can give this country
the biggest stick in the playground.


724
00:57:09.285 --> 00:57:11.912
And I intend to do that.

725
00:57:12.455 --> 00:57:16.000
And I'll tell you something
about our bunch.


726
00:57:16.125 --> 00:57:18.461
Get them close.

727
00:57:18.586 --> 00:57:21.630
Then they'll go all the way.

728
00:57:22.214 --> 00:57:24.175
They're just not close enough yet.

729
00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:26.719
Yes, sir.

730
00:57:33.809 --> 00:57:38.064
Perhaps you should think of these
wedges as forming part of a shell.


731
00:57:38.189 --> 00:57:43.402
They do redirect the shock waves in
the same way as a lens redirects light.


732
00:57:43.527 --> 00:57:47.198
As a matter of interest, we've
already used the idea in England


733
00:57:47.323 --> 00:57:50.409
for armor-piercing shells.

734
00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:55.956
Pray it works.
We'll be back on schedule.


735
00:57:56.082 --> 00:57:58.334
Heads up.

736
00:57:58.584 --> 00:58:00.628
Watch your backs.

737
00:58:26.237 --> 00:58:29.240
No one ever used high explosives...

738
00:58:29.365 --> 00:58:33.494
as a precision instrument before.

739
00:58:33.619 --> 00:58:34.912
It's so simple.

740
00:58:35.037 --> 00:58:38.582
It just swings the shock waves
from convex to concave.


741
00:58:38.708 --> 00:58:42.586
- Some orange, hey, Oppie?
- No, after the explosion.


742
00:58:47.550 --> 00:58:51.095
Dr. Oppenheimer.

743
00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:52.596
A letter for you, sir.

744
00:58:52.722 --> 00:58:56.100
- They said it was important.
- Thank you.


745
00:59:50.696 --> 00:59:53.532
Good luck.

746
01:00:09.006 --> 01:00:11.592
<i>We squeezed it!
Damn it, we got compression!</i>


747
01:00:11.717 --> 01:00:14.762
<i>We're on the way!
The right mix and we're home, Oppie!</i>


748
01:00:14.887 --> 01:00:17.515
<i>We're home free, vindicated!
We're vindicated!</i>


749
01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:21.394
- We got a ball game here.
- Seth, come here!


750
01:00:21.519 --> 01:00:24.647
Next stop, implosion!

751
01:00:52.425 --> 01:00:55.469
Can I come in?

752
01:00:55.594 --> 01:00:57.763
Where is he?

753
01:00:57.888 --> 01:01:00.099
He's out back.

754
01:01:00.224 --> 01:01:04.020
Sitting in the sun
with a blanket on his lap.


755
01:01:04.145 --> 01:01:07.898
Nursing a guilty dick, no doubt.

756
01:01:08.733 --> 01:01:12.528
It is not necessary to be vulgar.

757
01:01:13.029 --> 01:01:15.448
Nothing I say could
approach the vulgarity


758
01:01:15.573 --> 01:01:18.743
of what you're building
in your back yard.


759
01:01:20.286 --> 01:01:24.123
Well, vulgar or not...

760
01:01:24.248 --> 01:01:26.459
I need him to come
through on this.


761
01:01:26.584 --> 01:01:31.297
He owes it to his country.
He owes it to himself.


762
01:01:31.422 --> 01:01:35.051
He is the best there is. And he
should have whatever he wants.


763
01:01:35.176 --> 01:01:39.096
Don't try to recruit me, general.
You don't need my help.


764
01:01:39.221 --> 01:01:44.101
And spare me your homily on being
a good wife. I know it by heart.


765
01:01:44.477 --> 01:01:47.855
Why did you put up with her
for so long?


766
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:53.069
Because he's the best there is.
He should have whatever he wants.


767
01:01:57.615 --> 01:02:00.076
I don't live very well alone.

768
01:02:00.201 --> 01:02:01.994
Some people don't.

769
01:02:02.119 --> 01:02:06.207
We all have different ways
of defending our territory.


770
01:02:10.252 --> 01:02:15.591
Concha, you're late.
Peter, hurry up. Didn't I say 2:00?


771
01:02:22.306 --> 01:02:24.642
I'm sorry.

772
01:02:26.727 --> 01:02:31.649
And I am sorry that the news
took so long to get to you.


773
01:02:31.774 --> 01:02:34.944
It just got lost
in the system censors.


774
01:02:35.903 --> 01:02:37.989
You know...

775
01:02:39.573 --> 01:02:44.245
You can't be responsible
for keeping somebody else alive.


776
01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:48.332
It isn't possible.
It's not to be expected.


777
01:02:48.457 --> 01:02:51.794
I can't work on this anymore.

778
01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:00.928
I don't want to.

779
01:03:01.387 --> 01:03:03.055
And I don't need to.

780
01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.058
Germany is finished.

781
01:03:06.183 --> 01:03:10.021
It's just a matter of time.
They can't pull this together.


782
01:03:10.146 --> 01:03:14.025
- You sure?
- I don't want to hear your arguments.


783
01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.987
I already know that everything is a risk.

784
01:03:18.112 --> 01:03:20.698
That the war is
not over until it's over.

785
01:03:20.823 --> 01:03:24.035
That they're lobbing rockets
all over London.


786
01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.663
That Germany is desperate.
That she's resourceful.


787
01:03:27.788 --> 01:03:30.666
If she doesn't get a device,
she could litter England


788
01:03:30.791 --> 01:03:34.211
with radioactive material.
We thought of something similar.


789
01:03:34.337 --> 01:03:36.339
The fact of the matter is...

790
01:03:36.464 --> 01:03:40.468
they're not as good as we are.
Or are they?


791
01:03:46.015 --> 01:03:49.101
Christ, I've got rats in my skull.

792
01:03:51.854 --> 01:03:56.359
I'm being asked to throw too many
balls in the air at the same time.


793
01:03:58.653 --> 01:04:02.156
When I feel like that,
I get down on my knees...


794
01:04:03.157 --> 01:04:05.326
and I pray.

795
01:04:05.868 --> 01:04:08.663
And that's how I get conviction.

796
01:04:08.788 --> 01:04:12.500
If you let this slip through your fingers,
through our fingers,


797
01:04:12.625 --> 01:04:15.211
and somebody else gets it...

798
01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:20.049
you won't be counting how many
balls you throw in the air.


799
01:04:24.136 --> 01:04:28.307
If you need the fire, you find it.

800
01:04:28.599 --> 01:04:31.102
Wherever.

801
01:04:38.609 --> 01:04:40.194
<i>At last, some good news.</i>

802
01:04:40.319 --> 01:04:44.615
<i>Apparently, sufficient uranium is
beginning to arrive from Oak Ridge.</i>


803
01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:49.286
<i>But, as brilliant as he is, Oppie's
beginning to show the strain.</i>


804
01:04:49.412 --> 01:04:50.955
<i>We all depend on Oppie.</i>

805
01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.082
<i>He's our inspiration.</i>

806
01:04:53.207 --> 01:04:57.003
<i>If he were to crack,
we'd all fall apart.</i>


807
01:04:58.045 --> 01:05:01.632
Beautiful, isn't it, Michael?
Just think...


808
01:05:01.757 --> 01:05:05.261
a few miles closer to the sun,
a few miles farther away,


809
01:05:05.386 --> 01:05:08.180
none of this would be here.
Just a cloud of gas


810
01:05:08.305 --> 01:05:11.559
or a block of ice
and nobody to enjoy it.


811
01:05:12.226 --> 01:05:14.437
"Odi et amor",
"I hate and I love."


812
01:05:14.562 --> 01:05:17.815
- Catullus. Do you know it?
- No.


813
01:05:19.567 --> 01:05:24.280
"I hate and I love
Why, you ask? I don't know


814
01:05:24.405 --> 01:05:29.076
I feel both
And I'm in agony"


815
01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:35.041
Maybe General Groves is right. Maybe
we should just banish thinking forever.


816
01:05:38.127 --> 01:05:41.547
Michael, we have to test
the critical mass.


817
01:05:41.881 --> 01:05:46.093
- Are you going to help?
- Of course.


818
01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:49.305
I want to show you something.

819
01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:10.576
Come here to see our little toy?

820
01:06:11.994 --> 01:06:16.248
Michael, that's what we call
tickling the dragon's tail.


821
01:06:16.374 --> 01:06:20.044
So a slug of uranium
about two by six inches


822
01:06:20.169 --> 01:06:23.047
will be pulled by this weight.

823
01:06:23.172 --> 01:06:27.468
It begins here, then accelerates
at 32 feet per second per second.


824
01:06:27.593 --> 01:06:31.555
It passes between uranium bricks.
We have an instant of criticality.


825
01:06:31.681 --> 01:06:35.017
For a split second,
we have a chain reaction.


826
01:06:35.142 --> 01:06:38.312
As close as we come
to an atomic explosion in the lab.


827
01:06:38.437 --> 01:06:40.690
- Without blowing up.
- Exactly.


828
01:06:40.815 --> 01:06:44.777
It's essential to determine the amount
of material the device needs.


829
01:06:44.902 --> 01:06:47.989
Ten years ago I could
hardly imagine the stuff.


830
01:06:48.114 --> 01:06:49.615
Ten years.

831
01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:54.578
Each molecule collected
out of the air, one by one.


832
01:06:56.831 --> 01:06:59.250
Hello?

833
01:07:00.209 --> 01:07:02.294
What?

834
01:07:11.887 --> 01:07:15.558
<i>I have the rare privilege
of speaking for a victorious army</i>


835
01:07:15.683 --> 01:07:17.893
<i>of almost five million fighting men.</i>

836
01:07:18.019 --> 01:07:20.896
<i>They and the women
who have so ably assisted them</i>


837
01:07:21.022 --> 01:07:23.607
<i>constitute the Allied
Expeditionary Force</i>


838
01:07:23.733 --> 01:07:26.193
<i>that has liberated Western Europe.</i>

839
01:07:26.319 --> 01:07:28.946
<i>They have destroyed
or captured enemy armies</i>


840
01:07:29.071 --> 01:07:31.282
<i>totaling more than
their own strength</i>


841
01:07:31.407 --> 01:07:35.036
<i>and swept triumphantly forward
over the hundreds of miles</i>


842
01:07:35.161 --> 01:07:37.121
<i>separating Cherbourg from L├╝beck,</i>

843
01:07:37.246 --> 01:07:38.581
<i>Leipzig and Munich.</i>

844
01:07:38.706 --> 01:07:41.375
<i>These startling successes
have not been bought</i>


845
01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.294
<i>without sorrow and suffering.</i>

846
01:07:43.419 --> 01:07:46.297
<i>In this theater alone,

847
01:07:46.422 --> 01:07:48.674
<i>and comparable numbers
among the allies</i>


848
01:07:48.799 --> 01:07:50.718
<i>have had their lives cut short</i>

849
01:07:50.843 --> 01:07:56.223
<i>so that the rest of us might live
in the sunlight of freedom.</i>


850
01:08:06.067 --> 01:08:08.277
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!


851
01:08:08.402 --> 01:08:10.905
What are we gonna do
when this is over?


852
01:08:11.030 --> 01:08:13.282
I don't know.
Probably start another one.


853
01:08:13.407 --> 01:08:17.662
That's what I love about this job.
A guaranteed future. I'm not wrong.


854
01:08:17.787 --> 01:08:22.041
Believe me, we're descended
from a long line of noble predators.


855
01:08:22.166 --> 01:08:24.043
You are irrepressible.

856
01:08:24.168 --> 01:08:27.421
I think I'm gonna go be
irrepressible down with Fuller.


857
01:08:27.546 --> 01:08:30.132
Come on, baby face.

858
01:08:31.008 --> 01:08:34.387
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm irrepressible.


859
01:08:34.512 --> 01:08:36.097
So, what are you writing?

860
01:08:36.222 --> 01:08:38.557
Something Oppie said today.
I don't know.


861
01:08:38.683 --> 01:08:41.352
Well, read it. Go on.

862
01:08:43.813 --> 01:08:46.273
Makes you wonder
if there's an intelligence


863
01:08:46.399 --> 01:08:50.194
that isn't descended
from a long line of predators.


864
01:08:51.862 --> 01:08:54.407
I want to kiss you.

865
01:08:54.573 --> 01:08:56.909
Come here.

866
01:09:02.206 --> 01:09:06.585
Sir, is it true that since we KO'd
Germany, we're gonna go home?


867
01:09:06.711 --> 01:09:10.756
- I'll drink to that.
- That might be true, soldier.


868
01:09:13.968 --> 01:09:16.929
Can I have your attention, please?
Please.


869
01:09:17.054 --> 01:09:18.347
Excuse me.

870
01:09:18.472 --> 01:09:22.476
Seems to me that we have a shortage
of dance partners on the floor.


871
01:09:22.601 --> 01:09:25.938
So as a tribute
to our men in uniform...


872
01:09:26.564 --> 01:09:29.025
I'd like to make
available the services


873
01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:32.403
of all the longhairs at Los Alamos
on this dance floor.


874
01:09:32.528 --> 01:09:35.531
And to break
the ceremonial ice,


875
01:09:35.656 --> 01:09:39.785
I will choose
the first dance partner.


876
01:09:43.247 --> 01:09:49.837
General Groves...
may I have this dance?


877
01:09:51.756 --> 01:09:54.383
Why not?

878
01:10:22.119 --> 01:10:26.082
- Why do you have that with you?
- I keep it as a record for my dad.


879
01:10:26.207 --> 01:10:29.251
If I wrote him a letter,
all he'd get is black lines.


880
01:10:29.377 --> 01:10:31.671
This way I can tell him
what's going on.


881
01:10:31.796 --> 01:10:35.007
And what are you gonna
write about today?


882
01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.677
Besides the war being over?

883
01:10:37.802 --> 01:10:39.929
Yeah.

884
01:10:40.971 --> 01:10:45.476
Well, I met this girl.

885
01:10:48.354 --> 01:10:51.315
Did I just kiss you up there?

886
01:10:57.947 --> 01:11:02.243
You got to bring your heads in out
of the clouds. Out of the clouds.


887
01:11:03.119 --> 01:11:07.123
Keep the muttering to a minimum,
please, gentlemen.


888
01:11:07.999 --> 01:11:10.918
Some of you dancing...

889
01:11:11.043 --> 01:11:13.170
close together.

890
01:11:13.295 --> 01:11:17.758
I don't like the look of it.

891
01:11:17.883 --> 01:11:23.806
There are... bosoms in the area.

892
01:11:24.306 --> 01:11:28.519
And this could lead to pregnancy.

893
01:11:28.644 --> 01:11:32.273
Any man getting caught out of hand
or getting caught in hand


894
01:11:32.398 --> 01:11:36.277
will have to turn their peckers
over to the FBI.


895
01:11:43.826 --> 01:11:47.788
They're having fun. That's nice.
They're entitled.


896
01:11:48.331 --> 01:11:52.168
- So long as they don't think it's over.
- Isn't it?


897
01:11:53.002 --> 01:11:55.713
I mean,
what's all the celebration for?


898
01:11:55.838 --> 01:11:59.258
Perhaps we can find
some other use for this work.


899
01:11:59.383 --> 01:12:00.676
Fascism's dead.

900
01:12:00.801 --> 01:12:02.553
You mean in Europe.

901
01:12:02.678 --> 01:12:05.848
What do they think Japan
is doing, shooting squirrels?


902
01:12:05.973 --> 01:12:10.227
No, they're not shooting squirrels,
and that's not the issue.


903
01:12:10.353 --> 01:12:12.563
What is the issue?

904
01:12:12.688 --> 01:12:16.442
They don't have the technology.
They're not capable of it.


905
01:12:16.567 --> 01:12:18.611
So if we don't need it...

906
01:12:18.736 --> 01:12:20.988
why make it?

907
01:12:21.322 --> 01:12:23.866
I want you to look at something.

908
01:12:23.991 --> 01:12:28.704
It's the largest collection
of nothing in the entire world.


909
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:32.500
Make them work...

910
01:12:33.334 --> 01:12:35.711
and you've got something.

911
01:12:35.836 --> 01:12:38.047
An irresistible something.

912
01:12:38.172 --> 01:12:40.675
Just the threat...

913
01:12:41.425 --> 01:12:44.011
and they're ours.

914
01:12:45.179 --> 01:12:47.431
You know, sometimes,

915
01:12:47.556 --> 01:12:49.225
just standing here,

916
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:51.769
I keep wondering.

917
01:12:51.894 --> 01:12:56.107
Are we working on them
or are they working on us?


918
01:12:56.816 --> 01:13:01.570
Give them dignity, doctor.
Then we can start talking...


919
01:13:01.821 --> 01:13:04.573
about who can do what...

920
01:13:06.242 --> 01:13:09.370
and what they mean.

921
01:13:28.681 --> 01:13:31.976
Oh, what time is it?

922
01:13:36.397 --> 01:13:41.777
Even when I sleep, it's like dogs
tearing at a piece of meat.


923
01:13:42.403 --> 01:13:44.947
Robert?

924
01:13:45.823 --> 01:13:47.950
Thinking of resigning?

925
01:13:48.075 --> 01:13:50.661
No.

926
01:13:52.663 --> 01:13:54.498
I'd be written off.

927
01:13:54.623 --> 01:13:59.086
They wouldn't understand.
Not in the present climate.


928
01:14:01.464 --> 01:14:05.968
I keep obsessing about the device.

929
01:14:06.093 --> 01:14:10.056
Yes, it's true, but...

930
01:14:11.557 --> 01:14:14.393
if you think beyond...

931
01:14:14.894 --> 01:14:19.315
it's a limitless supply of energy.
Think about it, Kitty.


932
01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:23.069
The power that drives the universe.

933
01:14:25.196 --> 01:14:27.490
It's beyond imagination, really.

934
01:14:27.615 --> 01:14:30.076
And we'd have tamed it.

935
01:14:31.869 --> 01:14:34.497
A new world.

936
01:14:43.172 --> 01:14:45.466
Go get them, cowboy.

937
01:14:59.897 --> 01:15:01.649
What's going on over there?

938
01:15:01.774 --> 01:15:06.445
Cattle destroyed the entire ground
cable run. Ruined two days' work.


939
01:15:08.155 --> 01:15:12.493
Why didn't they herd them outside
the site? Anyone suggest that?


940
01:15:12.618 --> 01:15:18.374
The ranchers wouldn't move them.
Seems the Army stopped negotiating.


941
01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:26.173
- This is out of control.
- Edward, these estimates...


942
01:15:26.298 --> 01:15:29.343
Rush, push, speed, deadlines.

943
01:15:29.468 --> 01:15:32.346
This whole project
has gotten out of control.


944
01:15:32.471 --> 01:15:35.599
We haven't thought about
the consequences, Oppie.


945
01:15:35.725 --> 01:15:37.435
- Oppie?
- Wilson!


946
01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:40.521
We've been waiting
for the data for two weeks.


947
01:15:40.646 --> 01:15:43.482
When are we gonna get it?

948
01:15:46.193 --> 01:15:48.029
Wilson is correct.

949
01:15:48.154 --> 01:15:51.699
We have to talk about what we're
all thinking but not saying.


950
01:15:51.824 --> 01:15:55.036
This argument is arcane, Edward.

951
01:15:55.161 --> 01:15:57.079
This thing is becoming real.

952
01:15:57.204 --> 01:16:00.833
It's going to affect lives,
thousands of lives.


953
01:16:00.958 --> 01:16:03.127
We have to start to talk.

954
01:16:03.252 --> 01:16:06.630
All right. But not here.

955
01:16:06.756 --> 01:16:10.134
At my home tonight.

956
01:16:18.684 --> 01:16:21.395
<i>So now we tickle
the tail of the dragon.</i>


957
01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:24.190
All right, take her up.

958
01:16:24.607 --> 01:16:28.069
<i>I can only hope the uranium
slug doesn't get stuck in the pile.</i>


959
01:16:28.194 --> 01:16:32.031
<i>If it does,
we'll probably all evaporate.</i>


960
01:16:32.156 --> 01:16:35.409
- What's the reading?
- 1.19-K.


961
01:16:36.994 --> 01:16:39.497
- Waiting on your word.
- Meter's ready.


962
01:16:39.622 --> 01:16:41.791
Ready when you are.

963
01:16:43.459 --> 01:16:45.169
Let's go.

964
01:16:45.294 --> 01:16:47.505
OK, let's tickle it.

965
01:16:54.887 --> 01:16:57.056
It burst. It burst.

966
01:16:57.181 --> 01:16:59.809
It burst right from here.

967
01:16:59.934 --> 01:17:02.061
All right, add it up.

968
01:17:02.186 --> 01:17:04.271
Cigarette break.

969
01:17:04.397 --> 01:17:06.816
Good job.

970
01:17:16.158 --> 01:17:18.911
Michael. Hey, Michael.
You got a moment?


971
01:17:19.036 --> 01:17:22.373
They won't let me in this place.
Still going to Chicago?


972
01:17:22.498 --> 01:17:24.625
Yeah, Frisch can't pick the slugs up.

973
01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:28.671
Great. There's something we'd
like you to pick up, if you can.


974
01:17:28.796 --> 01:17:31.841
You know Leo Szilard, right?
And Ralph Lapp?


975
01:17:31.966 --> 01:17:35.177
Well, about 20 of our other
colleagues from Chicago,


976
01:17:35.302 --> 01:17:40.266
they're proposing a petition stating
they're opposed to the device.


977
01:17:40.725 --> 01:17:44.061
They're concerned about
what they think's gonna happen.


978
01:17:44.186 --> 01:17:49.442
So am I. I got a brother who's
in the Philippines right now.


979
01:17:49.567 --> 01:17:51.819
I read the papers. 
I'm concerned.

980
01:17:51.944 --> 01:17:56.407
I'm not asking you to endorse
anything. I haven't even read it yet.


981
01:17:56.532 --> 01:17:59.744
It should be discussed.
All I'm asking is pick it up,


982
01:17:59.869 --> 01:18:03.456
let us peruse it and make up
our own minds. How tough is that?


983
01:18:03.581 --> 01:18:05.791
- Makes sense.
- It's only fair.


984
01:18:05.916 --> 01:18:08.127
I'll pick it up for you.

985
01:18:08.252 --> 01:18:11.088
- See you later.
- OK.


986
01:18:12.131 --> 01:18:14.675
How can you rationalize
premeditated murder?


987
01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:17.261
Oh, bullshit. Premeditated murder?

988
01:18:17.386 --> 01:18:20.389
- This is a war. It's about winning.
- At what cost?


989
01:18:20.514 --> 01:18:23.142
You can't just outlaw a weapon.

990
01:18:23.267 --> 01:18:26.270
The more effective,
the more likely it will be used.


991
01:18:26.395 --> 01:18:28.898
We didn't use poison gas.
That was stopped.


992
01:18:29.023 --> 01:18:32.109
You got to speak up.
The generals won't listen to us.


993
01:18:32.234 --> 01:18:36.739
Yeah, and speak up on behalf
of all those kids hiding in foxholes.


994
01:18:36.864 --> 01:18:40.326
I know what they'd say. The
Japanese brought this on themselves.


995
01:18:40.451 --> 01:18:42.328
They have themselves to blame.

996
01:18:42.453 --> 01:18:45.289
I wouldn't care if the place
went up in smoke...


997
01:18:45.414 --> 01:18:48.584
Excuse me,
just for a minute, gentlemen.


998
01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:51.754
And I resent your suggesting

999
01:18:51.879 --> 01:18:53.964
I don't recognize a moral argument.

1000
01:18:54.090 --> 01:18:57.551
Why are you still awake?
Aren't you supposed to be sleeping?


1001
01:18:57.677 --> 01:19:01.889
- I don't like sleeping.
- There are lots of things we don't like.


1002
01:19:02.014 --> 01:19:06.143
We have to do them if we
want to do the things we do like.


1003
01:19:06.268 --> 01:19:09.397
- What's the treat tomorrow?
- Go horseback riding.


1004
01:19:09.522 --> 01:19:13.693
That's right. Now, how are you
going to ride a great big horse


1005
01:19:13.818 --> 01:19:15.861
if you don't get plenty of rest?

1006
01:19:15.987 --> 01:19:18.531
Go to sleep for daddy?

1007
01:19:18.656 --> 01:19:20.950
That's a good boy.

1008
01:19:27.748 --> 01:19:30.084
It is hot.

1009
01:19:30.209 --> 01:19:33.587
We could go to Carlucci's,
get some ice coffee and donuts.


1010
01:19:33.713 --> 01:19:35.840
The project is beginning to unravel.

1011
01:19:35.965 --> 01:19:38.718
- What?
- There have always been questions.


1012
01:19:38.843 --> 01:19:43.639
We've always avoided the answers.
Now, everything is coming to a head.


1013
01:19:43.764 --> 01:19:45.516
- Bronson?
- Sir?


1014
01:19:45.641 --> 01:19:47.935
- Stop the car.
- Yes, sir.


1015
01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:51.605
- Get out, take a leak or something.
- This is a public park.


1016
01:19:51.731 --> 01:19:55.943
Well, pick some flowers.
I want to do some shouting.


1017
01:20:04.118 --> 01:20:05.494
It's a crisis.

1018
01:20:05.619 --> 01:20:08.247
A crisis of conscience.

1019
01:20:09.373 --> 01:20:12.251
All right. I'm not shouting.

1020
01:20:12.376 --> 01:20:14.837
I'm not even angry.

1021
01:20:14.962 --> 01:20:18.132
I am just stumped.

1022
01:20:19.383 --> 01:20:21.677
You want to sit on your hands,

1023
01:20:21.802 --> 01:20:23.471
polish your conscience,

1024
01:20:23.596 --> 01:20:28.934
when we might be able to end
this whole thing with one shot?


1025
01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.395
Crisis of conscience?

1026
01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:33.064
All right.

1027
01:20:33.189 --> 01:20:34.523
Have it.

1028
01:20:34.649 --> 01:20:36.359
Take a bath in it.

1029
01:20:36.484 --> 01:20:38.569
Soak in it.

1030
01:20:38.861 --> 01:20:41.822
Then tell me whether you're
going to deliver them.


1031
01:20:41.947 --> 01:20:44.533
Whether you're gonna finish this job.

1032
01:20:44.659 --> 01:20:49.038
You tell me how I'm gonna face
a senate inquiry


1033
01:20:49.163 --> 01:20:54.460
and say we spent two billion dollars
on a show that's never gonna open.


1034
01:20:54.627 --> 01:20:56.295
Crisis of conscience.

1035
01:20:56.420 --> 01:21:01.300
You got one job, doctor.
Give me the bomb. Just give it to me.


1036
01:21:01.425 --> 01:21:03.969
Atrocious things have been done
in Germany


1037
01:21:04.095 --> 01:21:06.681
because people didn't speak out.

1038
01:21:06.806 --> 01:21:11.018
And we blame them for it. Right,
I think, even though it was dangerous.


1039
01:21:11.143 --> 01:21:13.938
But it's not dangerous
for us to speak out.


1040
01:21:14.063 --> 01:21:16.399
That's what a lot
of us in Chicago feel.

1041
01:21:16.524 --> 01:21:20.027
You don't have to agree
with the contents of this petition.


1042
01:21:20.152 --> 01:21:22.571
You have to agree
it should be discussed.


1043
01:21:22.697 --> 01:21:25.700
- Yes, sir.
- Good boy, Michael.


1044
01:21:26.325 --> 01:21:28.828
Good seeing you again.

1045
01:21:58.399 --> 01:22:00.234
- It came in on the wire.
- What?


1046
01:22:00.359 --> 01:22:04.572
Japanese are feeling out terms for
surrender. They made a proposition.


1047
01:22:04.697 --> 01:22:07.700
What kind of surrender?
Not unconditional?


1048
01:22:07.825 --> 01:22:09.785
Not according to my sources, no.

1049
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:11.412
Good.

1050
01:22:11.537 --> 01:22:13.789
No one will buy it.

1051
01:22:13.914 --> 01:22:16.751
- Sir?
- Nothing.


1052
01:22:16.876 --> 01:22:20.880
Come on. Come on. Right here.

1053
01:22:22.131 --> 01:22:25.676
Mr. Secretary, a brutal question.

1054
01:22:25.801 --> 01:22:28.095
Are you and the president

1055
01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:29.638
looking to Russia,

1056
01:22:29.764 --> 01:22:33.392
figuring they'll come into Japan,
assuming there's an invasion?


1057
01:22:33.517 --> 01:22:36.437
If you are, you're not
gonna get that for nothing.


1058
01:22:36.562 --> 01:22:40.358
Russia's gonna want
Manchuria, Sakhalin.


1059
01:22:40.483 --> 01:22:43.861
I can give the president Japan.

1060
01:22:44.278 --> 01:22:46.447
No invasion, no deals.

1061
01:22:46.572 --> 01:22:47.990
Can you guarantee that?

1062
01:22:48.115 --> 01:22:50.951
Some of your scientists
are getting out of line.


1063
01:22:51.077 --> 01:22:54.121
I hear they've been maneuvering
to see the president.


1064
01:22:54.246 --> 01:22:56.082
I didn't know that.

1065
01:22:56.207 --> 01:22:58.125
I will take care of it.

1066
01:22:58.250 --> 01:23:02.129
- Very well. Do that, general.
- Mr. Secretary.


1067
01:23:02.254 --> 01:23:04.840
Good night.

1068
01:23:07.134 --> 01:23:09.762
Panton?

1069
01:23:10.805 --> 01:23:13.099
Dr. Oppenheimer had...

1070
01:23:13.391 --> 01:23:17.978
on three separate occasions,
meetings with suspected agents,


1071
01:23:18.104 --> 01:23:20.064
communists, whatever.

1072
01:23:20.189 --> 01:23:22.733
- He gave us one name, correct?
- Yes, sir.


1073
01:23:22.858 --> 01:23:25.903
Press him on the others.

1074
01:23:26.028 --> 01:23:29.240
- He needs to feel the branch creak.
- Yes, sir.


1075
01:23:29.365 --> 01:23:32.159
- Ready?
- Yeah, we're ready.


1076
01:23:36.455 --> 01:23:39.375
They told me you were down here.
I was having lunch.


1077
01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:42.753
I got a call from Captain Panton.
A security problem again.


1078
01:23:42.878 --> 01:23:45.798
Well, I'm being harassed,
and I'm sick of it.


1079
01:23:45.923 --> 01:23:48.926
I had a security clearance.
This was a dead issue.


1080
01:23:49.051 --> 01:23:51.929
It's never dead with you.

1081
01:23:52.054 --> 01:23:56.308
Though I will try to put a lid on it.
This is not gonna help.


1082
01:23:56.434 --> 01:23:59.145
- What's this?
- Some kind of petition


1083
01:23:59.270 --> 01:24:04.400
from your boys in Chicago trying to go
around us to see the president.


1084
01:24:04.525 --> 01:24:08.487
That will never happen.

1085
01:24:08.612 --> 01:24:11.824
Do you know about this?

1086
01:24:12.992 --> 01:24:14.994
About the ideas, yes.

1087
01:24:15.119 --> 01:24:18.372
They want to demonstrate
the device, not use it.


1088
01:24:18.497 --> 01:24:21.334
Is it containable?

1089
01:24:21.459 --> 01:24:24.503
Can you stop it?

1090
01:24:26.464 --> 01:24:29.675
My hash is getting cold upstairs.

1091
01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.595
- Don't let these dodos distract you.
- How can...


1092
01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:37.808
Robert, you are this far away
from being the man who won the war.


1093
01:24:37.933 --> 01:24:39.977
These are important people
in Chicago.


1094
01:24:40.102 --> 01:24:42.897
You can't ignore
what they have to say.


1095
01:24:43.022 --> 01:24:47.193
All they want is an opportunity
to talk about the demonstration.


1096
01:24:47.318 --> 01:24:50.946
- What's his name? Szilard.
- Szilard.


1097
01:24:51.072 --> 01:24:52.865
Sitting in the bathtub.

1098
01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:57.912
I should have drowned that
son of a bitch the first day I met him.


1099
01:24:58.329 --> 01:25:01.707
What's wrong with demonstrating?
What's wrong with not killing?


1100
01:25:01.832 --> 01:25:03.876
You vaporize some uninhabited atoll.

1101
01:25:04.001 --> 01:25:07.046
Set terms of surrender,
then send the Japanese home.


1102
01:25:07.171 --> 01:25:10.216
It's mush. It won't work.

1103
01:25:10.341 --> 01:25:14.303
They are kamikazes, all of them.

1104
01:25:16.097 --> 01:25:18.849
You had money in your background.
That explains it.


1105
01:25:18.974 --> 01:25:21.102
- What does that mean?
- Your optimism.


1106
01:25:21.227 --> 01:25:25.439
Faith in human nature.
I never had any. Money, that is.


1107
01:25:25.564 --> 01:25:30.152
Never had a permanent house.
Made me a realist.


1108
01:25:32.363 --> 01:25:35.449
The idea should go to the president.

1109
01:25:36.367 --> 01:25:39.328
Where do you get these ideas?

1110
01:25:39.453 --> 01:25:42.039
You know, those boys in security...

1111
01:25:42.164 --> 01:25:45.710
got a right to ask where
these ideas are coming from.


1112
01:25:45.835 --> 01:25:52.258
Demonstrations, stopping work,
sharing with other countries.


1113
01:25:52.383 --> 01:25:54.677
You're gonna have
a tough time proving


1114
01:25:54.802 --> 01:25:57.805
that those ideas
are coming out of Chicago.


1115
01:25:57.930 --> 01:26:00.474
- They are foreign, subversive.
- They're moral.


1116
01:26:00.599 --> 01:26:02.977
- Moral?
- Moral.


1117
01:26:03.102 --> 01:26:05.730
Was Pearl Harbor moral?

1118
01:26:05.855 --> 01:26:08.691
Poland, Munich, moral?

1119
01:26:09.191 --> 01:26:12.737
Death March of Bataan,
was that moral?


1120
01:26:12.862 --> 01:26:14.947
Junk!

1121
01:26:15.156 --> 01:26:17.908
Demonstration junk.

1122
01:26:18.034 --> 01:26:21.287
I say you show the enemy
in the harshest terms


1123
01:26:21.412 --> 01:26:27.126
that you can muster, that you play
in the same league that they do.


1124
01:26:27.251 --> 01:26:32.256
At that meeting tomorrow there's
gonna be a vote on this demonstration.


1125
01:26:32.381 --> 01:26:35.676
There's gonna be a recommendation
going to the president.


1126
01:26:35.801 --> 01:26:37.928
Now, listen.

1127
01:26:38.054 --> 01:26:41.849
You can help yourself here.

1128
01:26:42.058 --> 01:26:45.644
Steer it in the right direction.

1129
01:26:45.895 --> 01:26:49.607
You're either for us or against us.
Ernest, how are you?


1130
01:26:49.732 --> 01:26:53.277
I'd like to introduce
Dr. Oppenheimer here.


1131
01:26:53.402 --> 01:26:56.822
Well, rumor has it
that we might owe you


1132
01:26:56.947 --> 01:26:59.659
for shaking those yellow monkeys
out of the trees.


1133
01:26:59.784 --> 01:27:03.329
Save us a lot, not going to Japan.
My boys are gonna be grateful.


1134
01:27:03.454 --> 01:27:07.541
Yes, I'm pleased to shake
your hand. And thank you.


1135
01:27:07.667 --> 01:27:10.544
Doctor, I'd like to add my shake too.

1136
01:27:10.670 --> 01:27:13.631
Nice seeing you.

1137
01:27:16.592 --> 01:27:19.804
Did you hear what they said?

1138
01:27:19.929 --> 01:27:25.685
You keep this on the track,
and we are gonna owe you, soldier.


1139
01:28:08.811 --> 01:28:14.150
<i>"We are in a completely new situation
that cannot be resolved by war.</i>


1140
01:28:14.483 --> 01:28:17.486
<i>A petition to the president
of the United States.</i>


1141
01:28:17.611 --> 01:28:20.072
<i>Discoveries of which the people
are not aware</i>


1142
01:28:20.197 --> 01:28:23.743
<i>may affect the welfare
of this nation in the near future."</i>


1143
01:28:23.868 --> 01:28:27.663
The Russians are our allies.
If we drop this without telling them,


1144
01:28:27.788 --> 01:28:30.750
we could give them a paranoia
that will make us sick.


1145
01:28:30.875 --> 01:28:35.504
The Japanese are on their knees.
All this kamikaze stuff is a load of bull.


1146
01:28:35.629 --> 01:28:40.509
They're wet-pants scared of us just
like we're wet-pants scared of them.


1147
01:28:40.634 --> 01:28:44.096
This war seems to have forced
a lot of guys on both sides


1148
01:28:44.221 --> 01:28:46.849
to resign from the human race.

1149
01:28:46.974 --> 01:28:50.811
- I hope we're not about to do that.
- I agree.


1150
01:28:50.936 --> 01:28:55.941
Our blockade will finish Japan
by autumn, maybe even sooner.


1151
01:28:56.067 --> 01:28:59.695
This device is not an honorable way
to win a war.


1152
01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:02.198
And I was taught to fight with honor.

1153
01:29:02.323 --> 01:29:04.492
If Custer...

1154
01:29:04.617 --> 01:29:07.036
had used the machine-gun...

1155
01:29:07.161 --> 01:29:11.290
his history would have been
written differently.


1156
01:29:12.208 --> 01:29:14.543
If you go ahead,

1157
01:29:14.669 --> 01:29:19.757
particularly, if you drop this thing
with no prior warning...


1158
01:29:19.882 --> 01:29:24.679
I, for one, will have to
resign my commission.


1159
01:29:26.972 --> 01:29:30.643
Perhaps you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

1160
01:29:36.065 --> 01:29:43.322
Incidentally, what is the opinion of
the committee on a demonstration?


1161
01:29:45.366 --> 01:29:48.202
Well, if we should agree
to a demonstration


1162
01:29:48.327 --> 01:29:50.371
with the attendant
Japanese observers


1163
01:29:50.496 --> 01:29:54.166
and that demonstration failed,

1164
01:29:54.291 --> 01:29:58.045
not only would we be unable
to induce the Japanese to surrender,


1165
01:29:58.170 --> 01:30:02.341
we would face a critical
shortage of material.


1166
01:30:04.218 --> 01:30:08.764
The dropping of the device
has always been implicit in this project.


1167
01:30:08.931 --> 01:30:13.227
So that is the advice I shall
pass on to the president.


1168
01:30:13.352 --> 01:30:15.730
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, that's right.


1169
01:30:15.855 --> 01:30:18.566
Yes.

1170
01:30:59.190 --> 01:31:01.484
- Sam.
- Bob, welcome to Trinity.


1171
01:31:01.609 --> 01:31:03.486
- Here she is.
- Can I grab one?


1172
01:31:03.611 --> 01:31:06.489
- It's all right.
- Good trip?


1173
01:31:08.908 --> 01:31:11.285
- Are you the accountable officer?
- Yes.


1174
01:31:11.410 --> 01:31:13.454
- This will be for you.
- What's that?


1175
01:31:13.579 --> 01:31:16.582
It states that the University
of California hands over


1176
01:31:16.707 --> 01:31:20.127
a plutonium core of a nuclear device
to the United States Army.


1177
01:31:20.252 --> 01:31:25.549
Put more simply,
it's a bill for two billion dollars.


1178
01:31:27.009 --> 01:31:30.763
Now, let me show you
what else your money's bought.


1179
01:31:31.931 --> 01:31:34.892
The initiator.

1180
01:31:36.936 --> 01:31:40.189
And the other half.

1181
01:31:40.773 --> 01:31:45.403
Now, all we got to do
is throw them together and...


1182
01:31:47.822 --> 01:31:51.659
Well, let's begin
final assembly.


1183
01:31:55.454 --> 01:31:58.749
OK, Mr. Merriman.

1184
01:32:10.094 --> 01:32:13.264
Well, you're quiet.

1185
01:32:14.974 --> 01:32:18.352
It's coming close, what you're
working towards, isn't it?


1186
01:32:18.477 --> 01:32:20.688
Yeah.

1187
01:32:20.813 --> 01:32:24.525
I can feel it pressing down
on everybody.


1188
01:32:24.650 --> 01:32:28.321
There's something going on here.

1189
01:32:29.196 --> 01:32:32.908
It's got everybody mesmerized,
doesn't it?


1190
01:32:33.034 --> 01:32:35.119
Yeah.

1191
01:32:35.244 --> 01:32:38.998
There's a regular run
on sleeping pills and aspirin.


1192
01:32:39.123 --> 01:32:43.502
And it's not just the work,
it's something else.


1193
01:32:46.005 --> 01:32:50.301
- Look, I know you can't talk about it.
- I can't.


1194
01:32:50.426 --> 01:32:53.596
Well, then talk to Dr. Oppenheimer.

1195
01:32:53.721 --> 01:32:57.933
I mean, if anyone has,
he'll have thought it through, right?


1196
01:32:58.392 --> 01:33:00.895
OK.

1197
01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:09.445
Touch me.

1198
01:33:24.710 --> 01:33:26.921
Naked.

1199
01:33:27.046 --> 01:33:30.424
Isn't that a beautiful word?

1200
01:33:32.468 --> 01:33:35.012
Tonight.

1201
01:33:35.137 --> 01:33:38.474
I want to make love.

1202
01:33:40.643 --> 01:33:43.020
And I want a future.

1203
01:33:43.145 --> 01:33:45.815
That's what I really want...

1204
01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:48.275
for you and me.

1205
01:33:48.401 --> 01:33:51.570
So do I.

1206
01:33:53.197 --> 01:33:58.119
- Oh, for chrissake, George.
- This pitting, must be the mold.


1207
01:33:58.244 --> 01:34:00.871
I'm not an explosives expert,
but I've been called


1208
01:34:00.997 --> 01:34:03.207
to look at something
that's unacceptable.


1209
01:34:03.332 --> 01:34:04.792
We must use hand lathings.

1210
01:34:04.917 --> 01:34:07.294
You should have used hand
lathings before.


1211
01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:10.673
- Hand lathings, you know what it is?
- Yes.


1212
01:34:10.798 --> 01:34:14.969
- Michael, what are you doing here?
- Chicago, Leo Szilard.


1213
01:34:15.094 --> 01:34:17.805
I read it on the train.

1214
01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:22.560
- Well, what do you think about it?
- It unnerved me.


1215
01:34:23.269 --> 01:34:25.730
Are we gonna discuss this ever?

1216
01:34:25.855 --> 01:34:28.691
Amongst ourselves?

1217
01:34:28.816 --> 01:34:32.903
- Are we going on?
- I don't see anyone stopping.


1218
01:34:33.029 --> 01:34:36.324
Now, look, we've been asked
to solve a technical problem,


1219
01:34:36.449 --> 01:34:40.077
to build this device.
We're not responsible for its use.


1220
01:34:40.202 --> 01:34:43.581
Oppie, it's for you.

1221
01:34:43.706 --> 01:34:47.543
Peter's got revised figures.

1222
01:34:53.424 --> 01:34:57.345
Look, let me keep this paper.

1223
01:34:57.470 --> 01:35:01.474
We're expecting the initiator.
We need your lab results, all right?


1224
01:35:01.599 --> 01:35:03.309
All right?

1225
01:35:03.434 --> 01:35:06.228
All right.

1226
01:35:25.373 --> 01:35:27.166
Everybody ready?

1227
01:35:27.291 --> 01:35:29.960
- Meter's ready.
- Here we go.


1228
01:35:49.271 --> 01:35:52.191
Twenty-one.

1229
01:35:58.155 --> 01:36:00.908
Twenty-nine.

1230
01:36:09.917 --> 01:36:12.962
Thirty-one.

1231
01:36:14.588 --> 01:36:17.216
Thirty-eight.

1232
01:36:17.508 --> 01:36:22.430
Got it? Forty.
Everybody back, right now.


1233
01:36:27.893 --> 01:36:30.312
Behind the wall.

1234
01:36:41.115 --> 01:36:43.617
Turn it off!

1235
01:36:50.666 --> 01:36:53.461
Nobody move! Don't anybody move!

1236
01:36:56.547 --> 01:36:59.008
Damn it!

1237
01:36:59.133 --> 01:37:01.218
Take off everything metal.
Drop it.


1238
01:37:01.344 --> 01:37:05.222
Mark the positions
you're standing in and get out.


1239
01:37:08.142 --> 01:37:09.685
The incident never happened.

1240
01:37:09.810 --> 01:37:13.648
If anyone should ask,
it did not happen.


1241
01:37:34.168 --> 01:37:37.338
Everybody should make it.

1242
01:37:38.422 --> 01:37:41.050
Except me.

1243
01:37:41.175 --> 01:37:43.969
I'm dead.

1244
01:38:04.949 --> 01:38:07.785
Doctor! Doctor!
I've been looking all over for you.


1245
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:10.538
We've got a problem.

1246
01:38:10.663 --> 01:38:11.956
- Bad allergy.
- When?


1247
01:38:12.081 --> 01:38:14.542
- An hour ago. They're bringing him in.
- Who?


1248
01:38:14.667 --> 01:38:16.002
Mr. Merriman.

1249
01:38:16.127 --> 01:38:17.878
- Michael?
- Yes, sir.


1250
01:38:18.004 --> 01:38:20.006
Oh, shit.

1251
01:38:20.131 --> 01:38:22.383
Let's go.

1252
01:38:22.508 --> 01:38:26.220
- Come on, let's go!
- Yes, sir.


1253
01:38:32.351 --> 01:38:34.979
This one won't do.

1254
01:38:37.106 --> 01:38:40.901
- In here. This one's good.
- Take it easy. All right, all right.


1255
01:38:41.027 --> 01:38:45.114
- Michael, what's the matter?
- Nothing, everything's fine.


1256
01:38:45.239 --> 01:38:48.242
- Doctor, how much did he get?
- More than 1,000 rads.


1257
01:38:48.367 --> 01:38:50.202
- Goddamn it.
- What's happening?


1258
01:38:50.328 --> 01:38:54.707
Sweetheart, it's under control.
Everything's under control, OK?


1259
01:38:54.915 --> 01:38:57.752
- Steven, what's going on?
- You should not be here.


1260
01:38:57.877 --> 01:38:59.754
Excuse me, there's no patient here.

1261
01:38:59.879 --> 01:39:02.798
No one's to hear about this.
Not Oppenheimer. Nobody.


1262
01:39:02.923 --> 01:39:06.427
- OK?
- Goddamn it, what happened here?


1263
01:39:06.552 --> 01:39:08.846
I want this ward sealed off.
Come with me.


1264
01:39:08.971 --> 01:39:12.558
I want military doctors in here.

1265
01:39:21.692 --> 01:39:24.570
Get the hell out of here!

1266
01:39:28.282 --> 01:39:30.660
It's the detonation circuits.

1267
01:39:32.036 --> 01:39:36.040
I don't know.
I would like another 24 hours.


1268
01:39:36.165 --> 01:39:39.210
I think so, but I can't be certain.

1269
01:39:39.335 --> 01:39:45.549
I said one more day.
I need one more day.


1270
01:39:45.925 --> 01:39:51.389
No, no, Merriman brought me
a copy from Chicago.


1271
01:39:51.514 --> 01:39:53.557
Some of the physicists
have signed it.


1272
01:39:53.683 --> 01:39:57.603
Pinko fruitcakes. Get that thing
to work, I'm gonna drop it on Chicago.


1273
01:39:57.728 --> 01:40:00.314
I swear I will.

1274
01:40:00.439 --> 01:40:06.362
Yes, I hear you. You hear me?
Finish the damn thing. That's an order.


1275
01:40:07.363 --> 01:40:11.033
Well, I got other business.

1276
01:40:11.158 --> 01:40:13.786
But I got a plane. 
I'll be there.

1277
01:40:13.911 --> 01:40:16.622
Every time I turn around,
somebody gets to him.


1278
01:40:16.747 --> 01:40:20.543
Now they're talking about postponing.

1279
01:40:24.588 --> 01:40:29.218
- Cleared for Washington?
- Yes, sir. We are.


1280
01:40:32.763 --> 01:40:36.225
"Truman, Stimson arrive Potsdam
for conference with Stalin.


1281
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:38.644
Advise results of Trinity Test soonest."

1282
01:40:38.769 --> 01:40:41.397
Stalin's gonna eat Truman alive
at this meeting.


1283
01:40:41.522 --> 01:40:44.191
- Unless we...
- Yes, unless...


1284
01:40:44.317 --> 01:40:47.987
we give the president something
lethal to stick in his back pocket.


1285
01:40:48.112 --> 01:40:53.117
I'll tell you something
it won't be... postponement.


1286
01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:03.961
Oh, lord... so close.

1287
01:41:06.047 --> 01:41:08.507
Sir.

1288
01:41:52.385 --> 01:41:57.139
Keep going down slow.

1289
01:41:59.725 --> 01:42:03.020
His heart looks larger. Could be
fluid in the pericardial sac.


1290
01:42:03.145 --> 01:42:04.897
- Radiation induced?
- Probably.


1291
01:42:05.022 --> 01:42:07.358
It's almost doubled in size overnight.

1292
01:42:07.483 --> 01:42:10.027
If this continues, his heart will drown.

1293
01:42:10.152 --> 01:42:12.571
- Is he lucid?
- In and out.


1294
01:42:12.697 --> 01:42:16.450
There's tremendous brain swelling
from the radiation.


1295
01:42:16.575 --> 01:42:21.205
- What happens next?
- I don't know. I mean, I have no idea.


1296
01:42:21.330 --> 01:42:24.750
No human being's ever gotten
this dose of radiation before.


1297
01:42:24.875 --> 01:42:26.711
He's dying from the inside out.

1298
01:42:26.836 --> 01:42:31.465
Other problems. His gastrointestinal
tract has been destroyed by radiation.


1299
01:42:31.590 --> 01:42:34.677
Excuse me, doctors.

1300
01:42:39.515 --> 01:42:42.643
You've got to believe
we're doing everything we know how.


1301
01:42:42.768 --> 01:42:44.228
Absolutely everything.

1302
01:42:44.353 --> 01:42:48.065
It's not gonna do any good
to have you ripping yourself apart.


1303
01:42:48.190 --> 01:42:52.695
- You've got to go home and sleep.
- Richard, I can't.


1304
01:43:50.961 --> 01:43:52.421
- Some orange.
- Sure is.


1305
01:43:52.546 --> 01:43:54.840
Hey, Oppie?

1306
01:44:07.937 --> 01:44:10.231
Look out!

1307
01:44:11.732 --> 01:44:13.442
Hornig?

1308
01:44:13.567 --> 01:44:15.861
- Hornig?
- It's all right.


1309
01:44:15.987 --> 01:44:18.739
The other safety's holding.

1310
01:44:20.741 --> 01:44:24.453
Does anybody else need a martini?

1311
01:44:26.497 --> 01:44:29.291
- What's the word?
- Oppie, it doesn't look good.


1312
01:44:29.417 --> 01:44:35.172
We have a chance of thunderstorms
over the next five days. I'm sorry.


1313
01:44:35.923 --> 01:44:39.635
I'm not telling you
what this guy's got up there.


1314
01:44:59.155 --> 01:45:01.157
- Why wasn't I told?
- Too much panic.


1315
01:45:01.282 --> 01:45:03.326
- How is he?
- Difficult to tell.


1316
01:45:03.451 --> 01:45:05.953
- I'd like to see him.
- We're not permitting visits.


1317
01:45:06.078 --> 01:45:08.748
But the men who were
with him have been spoken to.


1318
01:45:08.873 --> 01:45:11.208
Security. Delicate time.

1319
01:45:11.334 --> 01:45:15.296
He's a strong young man.
He'll pull through.


1320
01:45:15.713 --> 01:45:18.090
Schoenfield, how is he?

1321
01:45:18.215 --> 01:45:21.344
- Is he conscious?
- He's in and out.


1322
01:45:21.469 --> 01:45:23.888
He wants to know
if you read the petition.


1323
01:45:24.013 --> 01:45:28.100
- It means a lot to him.
- Yes, I have.


1324
01:45:28.225 --> 01:45:31.270
And then, that's it? That's all?

1325
01:45:31.395 --> 01:45:34.315
Yes, I have and then now
I wash my hands of it?


1326
01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:36.150
Now wait a minute, Oppenheimer.

1327
01:45:36.275 --> 01:45:39.278
I got a friend falling apart
who thinks you got the answers.


1328
01:45:39.403 --> 01:45:41.072
That's what you let him think.

1329
01:45:41.197 --> 01:45:45.451
Do you know what the Christ is going on,
or is the whole thing out of control?


1330
01:45:45.576 --> 01:45:47.995
If you're trying to make a point,
what is it?


1331
01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:51.207
I have spent the last
two years of my life


1332
01:45:51.332 --> 01:45:55.878
putting up with all your security
and your secrecy and your control.


1333
01:45:56.003 --> 01:45:59.048
I don't think that bullshit
was to keep what was going on


1334
01:45:59.173 --> 01:46:02.009
from the Germans
or the Japanese or the Russians.


1335
01:46:02.134 --> 01:46:04.553
It's to keep it from
American Jacks and Jills


1336
01:46:04.679 --> 01:46:06.972
because they may not
like what's going on.


1337
01:46:07.098 --> 01:46:10.017
American people don't
want to know what's going on.


1338
01:46:10.142 --> 01:46:12.603
They want to know
that their sons are alive.


1339
01:46:12.728 --> 01:46:15.856
I'm doing everything in my power
to see that they do.


1340
01:46:15.982 --> 01:46:18.693
Like Oak Ridge, where they're
injecting ill and old


1341
01:46:18.818 --> 01:46:21.195
people with huge doses of plutonium?

1342
01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:24.115
I don't know about Oak Ridge,
but if you want to ask


1343
01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:27.618
what's happening, ask this:
Will it be big enough?


1344
01:46:27.743 --> 01:46:31.080
Big enough to scare all of us
and make us stop and think?


1345
01:46:31.205 --> 01:46:35.292
Big enough to stop all war forever?
You want to ask a question, ask that.


1346
01:46:35.418 --> 01:46:38.754
Look, I've seen Oak Ridge, all right?

1347
01:46:38.879 --> 01:46:41.966
That place wasn't built
to make one or two bombs.


1348
01:46:42.091 --> 01:46:45.511
It was built to make
thousands of them. Thousands.


1349
01:46:45.636 --> 01:46:48.389
And soon everybody's
gonna have a bomb. They will.


1350
01:46:48.514 --> 01:46:52.393
What do they do with them?
Sit and wait till they go off, until "boom"?


1351
01:46:52.518 --> 01:46:55.187
Then we got one world
full of Michael Merrimans


1352
01:46:55.312 --> 01:46:58.733
dying from the inside out.
Is that what you're looking for?


1353
01:46:58.858 --> 01:47:03.112
Because that's the future
you've made for us.


1354
01:47:03.237 --> 01:47:07.450
Hey, Oppenheimer! Oppenheimer,
you ought to stop playing god


1355
01:47:07.575 --> 01:47:12.872
because you are not good at it
and the position is taken.


1356
01:47:23.466 --> 01:47:28.554
His pressure's falling fast.
You've got to get that fluid out now.


1357
01:47:32.350 --> 01:47:35.102
Needle, Michael.

1358
01:47:35.227 --> 01:47:38.189
OK, you're in. 
Start to pull it back.

1359
01:47:38.314 --> 01:47:41.108
Hang in, Michael.

1360
01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:45.112
Hang in, pal.

1361
01:47:45.529 --> 01:47:48.616
Come on, doc.

1362
01:47:49.283 --> 01:47:53.537
Pressure's starting to rise.
It's coming up slowly.


1363
01:48:12.682 --> 01:48:16.769
- Robert, you have to get some sleep.
- God.


1364
01:48:16.894 --> 01:48:20.314
I'm in a dark place.

1365
01:48:20.648 --> 01:48:23.567
We've all cooked this stew.

1366
01:48:23.693 --> 01:48:31.325
The Germans and the Japanese
and the Americans and the Brits.


1367
01:48:31.450 --> 01:48:35.746
It's an ugliness that goes back.
It goes way back.


1368
01:48:35.871 --> 01:48:39.625
I'm not a scientist anymore.

1369
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:44.672
I'm a goddamn functionary.

1370
01:48:45.089 --> 01:48:48.009
I've got to stay in control.

1371
01:48:48.134 --> 01:48:51.804
I've got to control who gets this thing.

1372
01:48:51.929 --> 01:48:56.934
Power and control,
it's all I ever hear about anymore.


1373
01:48:57.143 --> 01:48:59.687
Doesn't life matter to you?

1374
01:48:59.812 --> 01:49:02.398
What about love and understanding?

1375
01:49:02.523 --> 01:49:06.110
I thought that's what science
was all about.


1376
01:49:06.235 --> 01:49:09.280
I just wanted us to work.

1377
01:49:09.405 --> 01:49:15.161
Does everything have to be
sacrificed to this... thing?


1378
01:49:16.495 --> 01:49:19.874
I put up with...

1379
01:49:22.376 --> 01:49:24.795
Jean,

1380
01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:28.966
because I thought you needed her.

1381
01:49:30.176 --> 01:49:33.471
And I thought you'd give
her up because of me.


1382
01:49:34.388 --> 01:49:37.308
But she didn't count.

1383
01:49:37.433 --> 01:49:44.815
I don't count. Nothing counts for you
anymore except this damn bomb.


1384
01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:47.443
That's what it is.

1385
01:49:47.568 --> 01:49:50.905
But it's not your only creation.

1386
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:54.492
There are the children.

1387
01:49:55.117 --> 01:50:00.748
And you need my love and support.
I know.


1388
01:50:00.873 --> 01:50:03.000
I don't...

1389
01:50:03.125 --> 01:50:06.295
I don't know where it is.

1390
01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:09.548
Why me?

1391
01:50:11.133 --> 01:50:14.428
Why did he pick me?

1392
01:50:36.701 --> 01:50:38.786
- Panton!
- Sir?


1393
01:50:38.911 --> 01:50:42.707
Security's a mess. Nobody at
the checkpoint. Nobody up here.


1394
01:50:42.832 --> 01:50:45.710
- What do you think this is, a beach?
- No, sir.


1395
01:50:45.835 --> 01:50:48.796
We've got to call a halt.
The weather is unpredictable.


1396
01:50:48.921 --> 01:50:51.507
We are not calling a halt
on account of weather.


1397
01:50:51.632 --> 01:50:55.386
With the wind we could send
radioactive junk all the way to Amarillo.


1398
01:50:55.511 --> 01:50:59.306
You The New York Times reporter?
I want three reports.


1399
01:50:59.432 --> 01:51:02.727
One if we succeed, one if we fail
and one if we disintegrate.


1400
01:51:02.852 --> 01:51:06.731
With the wind blowing this direction,
Amarillo could get a fallout.


1401
01:51:06.856 --> 01:51:09.358
- Fermi's right.
- No, I'm saying no.


1402
01:51:09.483 --> 01:51:12.862
The decision is mine!

1403
01:51:12.987 --> 01:51:15.031
- Do you understand?
- We can't do it.


1404
01:51:15.156 --> 01:51:18.534
We go ahead with this. Sergeant,
do something about that dog.


1405
01:51:18.659 --> 01:51:21.329
You sound like you're planning
a railway schedule.


1406
01:51:21.454 --> 01:51:25.249
No, you are trying to uninvent this.

1407
01:51:25.374 --> 01:51:26.876
I can do it without you.

1408
01:51:27.001 --> 01:51:33.466
Well, if you do and I've said no
and something goes wrong...


1409
01:51:34.342 --> 01:51:36.052
Get in the car.

1410
01:51:36.177 --> 01:51:39.347
Hurry up.
What are you waiting on?


1411
01:52:03.954 --> 01:52:08.709
Sir, it looks like it's clearing up.

1412
01:52:28.312 --> 01:52:32.775
You know, you build to a moment,

1413
01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:37.363
and then you grab it,
or it will go right by you.


1414
01:52:38.072 --> 01:52:41.534
You always thought that
I would do this, didn't you?


1415
01:52:41.659 --> 01:52:45.079
Can you buck your own nature?

1416
01:52:46.664 --> 01:52:50.001
What will it be like?

1417
01:52:51.419 --> 01:52:54.755
Unimaginable.

1418
01:52:56.298 --> 01:52:59.427
It's your baby.

1419
01:53:09.186 --> 01:53:12.273
Do it.

1420
01:53:13.274 --> 01:53:15.109
Hallelujah.

1421
01:53:15.234 --> 01:53:18.070
He said it's a go.

1422
01:53:18.195 --> 01:53:20.489
Let's go.

1423
01:53:20.614 --> 01:53:24.243
Start the countdown.
Come on. It's a go.


1424
01:53:24.368 --> 01:53:27.913
- Let's go! Move it out!
- Wilson, wake up!


1425
01:53:28.039 --> 01:53:32.918
- Wake up the dragon.
- Let's go. Let's go.


1426
01:53:47.767 --> 01:53:49.852
Power on.

1427
01:53:49.977 --> 01:53:53.564
- Power on.
- Synchronization relays one open.


1428
01:53:53.689 --> 01:53:55.608
Synchronization relay one open.

1429
01:53:55.733 --> 01:54:02.073
- Synchronization relays two open.
- Synchronization relays two open.


1430
01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:21.258
I love you, Michael.

1431
01:54:27.556 --> 01:54:30.559
Easy.

1432
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:34.438
Breathe easy.

1433
01:54:50.579 --> 01:54:53.749
Easy.

1434
01:54:53.916 --> 01:54:57.253
Easy, come back to the ice.

1435
01:54:59.255 --> 01:55:03.134
It's OK, here's the ice.

1436
01:55:08.514 --> 01:55:11.934
Kathleen, what are you
doing in here?


1437
01:55:12.059 --> 01:55:14.812
Kathleen? God!

1438
01:55:14.937 --> 01:55:18.190
Come on, come on, sweetheart.

1439
01:55:18.899 --> 01:55:22.862
- You simply can't be here, sweetheart.
- I had to be with him.


1440
01:55:22.987 --> 01:55:28.159
I wanted to tell him I love him,
because he's going to die.


1441
01:55:33.122 --> 01:55:35.624
Detonation relays four open.

1442
01:55:38.294 --> 01:55:41.130
Well, it's armed.

1443
01:55:41.255 --> 01:55:45.885
- Now it's up to the bunker.
- Let's get down from here.


1444
01:55:52.391 --> 01:55:59.565
Well, I've always believed
that the lord was on our side.


1445
01:55:59.690 --> 01:56:03.194
And I think
now we're gonna prove it.


1446
01:56:42.483 --> 01:56:46.570
- Must be from the military base.
- Enrico, what do you bet on the yield?


1447
01:56:46.696 --> 01:56:49.115
I bet we set fire to the atmosphere.

1448
01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:51.659
If we're lucky,
we only wipe out New Mexico.


1449
01:56:51.784 --> 01:56:57.498
If we can ignite the air,
we finish off the planet. Any takers?


1450
01:56:57.623 --> 01:57:01.419
I kind of hope the damn thing
doesn't go off.


1451
01:57:01.877 --> 01:57:03.963
What the hell is that?

1452
01:57:04.088 --> 01:57:07.800
It's The Nutcracker Suite.

1453
01:57:07.925 --> 01:57:10.302
I can't get rid of it.

1454
01:57:10.428 --> 01:57:13.681
- Go to six-five.
- Six-five.


1455
01:57:13.889 --> 01:57:16.934
- OK, try seven.
- Seven.


1456
01:57:17.059 --> 01:57:19.979
Charging the device.

1457
01:57:28.029 --> 01:57:31.240
Robert, over here.

1458
01:57:36.245 --> 01:57:39.248
The device is fully charged.

1459
01:57:39.373 --> 01:57:43.336
It is now zero minus 60 seconds.
Fifty-nine, 58,


1460
01:57:43.461 --> 01:57:45.338
57, 56,

1461
01:57:45.463 --> 01:57:47.340
55, 54,

1462
01:57:47.465 --> 01:57:53.888
- 53, 52, 51, 50, 49...
- Where is that music coming from?


1463
01:57:54.013 --> 01:57:56.974
It's a ground channel.
I can't get rid of it.


1464
01:57:57.099 --> 01:58:02.188
44, 43, 42, 41, 40...

1465
01:58:02.313 --> 01:58:04.649
Goddamn music.

1466
01:58:04.774 --> 01:58:12.990
37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30,

1467
01:58:13.115 --> 01:58:14.992
29, 28,

1468
01:58:15.117 --> 01:58:18.663
27, 26, 25,

1469
01:58:18.788 --> 01:58:24.043
24, 23, 22, 21, 20,

1470
01:58:24.168 --> 01:58:30.424
19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14,

1471
01:58:30.549 --> 01:58:35.012
13, 12, 11, 10,

1472
01:58:35.137 --> 01:58:40.101
nine, eight, seven, six, five,

1473
01:58:40.226 --> 01:58:46.440
four, three, two, one, zero.

1474
02:01:15.423 --> 02:01:19.385
<i>Kathleen, my love.
You asked me a question once.</i>


1475
02:01:19.510 --> 02:01:22.513
<i>Was it instinct to save a life
or to take it?</i>


1476
02:01:22.638 --> 02:01:24.724
<i>Well, I don't know, my darling.</i>

1477
02:01:24.849 --> 02:01:28.936
<i>All I do know is that
if we are free to choose,</i>


1478
02:01:29.061 --> 02:01:32.606
<i>I hope to god
we choose life over death.</i>


1479
02:01:32.732 --> 02:01:36.736
<i>Not because I believe the implacable
universe cares a damn,</i>


1480
02:01:36.861 --> 02:01:39.947
<i>but because as I look at you,
my darling,</i>


1481
02:01:40.072 --> 02:01:42.366
<i>I realize how glorious,</i>

1482
02:01:42.491 --> 02:01:45.745
<i>how magical life can be.</i>
