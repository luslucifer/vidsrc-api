<i>In the 1st world war, and for the
first time in the history of man,</i>


2
00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.081
<i>nations combined to fight agents nations,</i>

3
00:00:13.107 --> 00:00:15.694
<i>using the crude weapons of those days.</i>

4
00:00:15.873 --> 00:00:19.171
<i>The second world war involved
every continent on the globe</i>


5
00:00:19.172 --> 00:00:22.331
<i>and men turned to science
for new devices of warfare</i>


6
00:00:22.507 --> 00:00:26.462
<i>which reached an unparalleled peak
in their capacity for destruction.</i>


7
00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:29.657
<i>And now, fraught with the terrible
weapons of super-science,</i>


8
00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:34.048
<i>menacing all mankind and every
creature on earth, comes...</i>

18
00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:41.546
<i>No one would have believed that in
the middle of the twenty century</i>


19
00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.908
<i>that human affairs were being
watched keenly and closely</i>


20
00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.999
<i>by intelligences greater than mans.</i>

21
00:01:47.182 --> 00:01:51.615
<i>Yet, across the gulf of
space on the planet Mars,</i>


22
00:01:51.817 --> 00:01:57.489
<i>intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic
regarded our earth with enviously, eyes</i>


23
00:01:57.692 --> 00:02:01.186
<i>slowly and surely drawing
their plans against us.</i>


24
00:02:02.207 --> 00:02:05.798
<i>Mars is more than 140
million miles from the sun.</i>


25
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:09.958
<i>And for centuries it has been in
the last stages of exhaustion.</i>


26
00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:15.592
<i>At night, temperatures drop far
below zero, even at its equator.</i>


27
00:02:15.793 --> 00:02:19.431
<i>The inhabitants of this dying
planet looked across space with</i>


28
00:02:19.457 --> 00:02:23.270
<i>instruments and intelligences of
which we have scarcely dreamed,</i>


29
00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:26.686
<i>searching for another world
to which they could migrate.</i>


30
00:02:27.582 --> 00:02:30.729
<i>They could not go to Pluto,
outer-most of all planets</i>


31
00:02:30.938 --> 00:02:35.335
<i>so cold that its atmosphere
lies frozen on its surface.</i>


32
00:02:36.453 --> 00:02:38.674
<i>They couldn't go to
Neptune or Uranus,</i>


33
00:02:38.907 --> 00:02:42.422
<i>twin worlds in eternal
night, and perpetual cold.</i>


34
00:02:42.607 --> 00:02:44.791
<i>Both surrounded by an unbreathable</i>

35
00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:48.223
<i>atmosphere of methane
gas and ammonia vapor.</i>


36
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.452
<i>The martians considered
Saturn, an attractive world,</i>


37
00:02:52.478 --> 00:02:56.016
<i>with its many moons and
beautiful ring's of cosmic dust</i>


38
00:02:56.193 --> 00:03:01.467
<i>but its temperature is close
to 270 degrees below zero,</i>


39
00:03:01.668 --> 00:03:05.975
<i>and ice lies 15,000 miles
deep on its surface.</i>


40
00:03:06.183 --> 00:03:08.389
<i>Their nearest world was giant Jupiter,</i>

41
00:03:08.674 --> 00:03:11.497
<i>where there are titanic
cliffs of lava and ice,</i>


42
00:03:11.498 --> 00:03:14.009
<i>with hydrogen flaming at the tops,</i>

43
00:03:14.215 --> 00:03:16.452
<i>where the atmospheric pressure is terrible.</i>

44
00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:19.514
<i>Thousands of pounds to the square inch.</i>

45
00:03:19.572 --> 00:03:21.133
<i>They couldn't go there.</i>

46
00:03:21.427 --> 00:03:24.723
<i>Nor could they go to Mercury,
nearest planet to the sun.</i>


47
00:03:24.724 --> 00:03:30.953
<i>It has no air, and the temperature at
its equator is that of molten lead.</i>


48
00:03:31.158 --> 00:03:36.704
<i>Of all the worlds that the intelligences
on Mars could see and study,</i>


49
00:03:36.912 --> 00:03:42.981
<i>only our own warm earth was green
with vegetation, bright with water,</i>


50
00:03:43.186 --> 00:03:48.380
<i>and possessed a cloudy
atmosphere eloquent of fertility.</i>


51
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:53.127
<i>It did not occur to mankind that a
swift fate might be hanging over us.</i>


52
00:03:53.336 --> 00:03:56.172
<i>Or that from the blackness of outer space</i>

53
00:03:56.173 --> 00:03:59.351
<i>we were being scrutinized and studied.</i>

54
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.443
<i>Until the time of our
nearest approach to the</i>


55
00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:05.634
<i>orbit of Mars during a
pleasant summer season...</i>


56
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:20.857
- Is that a fireball or something?
- Boy, that's big.


57
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:22.114
Maybe it's a comet.

58
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:24.817
r

59
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.845
<i>Oh!</i>

60
00:04:25.942 --> 00:04:26.901
Boy, that had me scared.

61
00:04:26.902 --> 00:04:28.953
- I wonder where it lit?
- Miles away I bet you


62
00:04:28.974 --> 00:04:31.506
- Hey, let's go find it.
- Probably dropped halfway to Pomona.


63
00:04:31.507 --> 00:04:32.345
Oh, it's nearer than that.

64
00:04:32.346 --> 00:04:33.881
I'm gonna see. Who's coming?

65
00:04:35.134 --> 00:04:37.521
This is Pine Summit. 
I got a smoke.

66
00:04:37.731 --> 00:04:42.437
- 160, 30.
- Azimuth: 160 degrees, 30 minutes.


67
00:04:43.486 --> 00:04:47.838
Big? I bet it's as big as anything
that ever lit in California.


68
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:51.996
Better get something over there.
It's started a blaze already.


69
00:04:53.158 --> 00:04:56.101
[UEeeeeeee]

70
00:04:57.006 --> 00:04:58.147
<i>Over here.</i>

71
00:04:58.172 --> 00:04:59.195
<i>Spray it this way.</i>

72
00:04:59.721 --> 00:05:01.125
<i>You there, with a shovel.</i>

73
00:05:04.925 --> 00:05:06.164
<i>Come over here with the shovel.</i>

74
00:05:06.165 --> 00:05:08.083
<i>Get in there or we're going
to have a brush fire.</i>


75
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:11.726
<i>Somebody get some water over here.</i>

76
00:05:11.727 --> 00:05:13.120
<i>C'mon, c'mon.</i>

77
00:05:13.422 --> 00:05:14.650
<i>Let me get in there.</i>

78
00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:16.770
<i>Out of the way.</i>

79
00:05:17.361 --> 00:05:18.684
<i>Start spraying water.</i>

80
00:05:19.592 --> 00:05:21.203
<i>Bring that hose over here.</i>

81
00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:23.580
<i>Get this quick fellas. 
Keep that it.</i>

82
00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:25.314
<i>Hey, grab this.</i>

83
00:05:27.002 --> 00:05:27.985
<i>Lend a hand over here.</i>

84
00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:32.593
Number three to D.O.,
number three to D.O.

00:05:32.796 --> 00:05:34.456
<i>≡⌁ D.O. 
To number three, come in. ⌁≡</i>

86
00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:35.988
We're getting
this under control.


87
00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:37.526
We won't need any more help. Over.

88
00:05:37.911 --> 00:05:42.696
<i>≡⌁ Okay, send the tanker in, but you stand
by until that thing cools off. Over. ⌁≡</i>


89
00:05:42.906 --> 00:05:45.119
I think someone ought
to check on it. Over.

90
00:05:45.253 --> 00:05:48.680
<i>≡⌁ Well there some fellas fishing at
Pines Summit, I think their scientist. ⌁≡</i>


91
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.551
<i>≡⌁ They probably saw it come down.
I'll let them know. ⌁≡</i>


92
00:05:51.552 --> 00:05:52.987
<i>≡⌁ What's it look like? ⌁≡</i>

93
00:05:53.176 --> 00:05:58.370
Can't get near enough to see it very well.
It's too hot. But it's a whale of a size.


94
00:06:04.536 --> 00:06:05.278
[Thunk]

95
00:06:06.562 --> 00:06:08.249
I got a message for you.

96
00:06:09.383 --> 00:06:11.162
You're the guys from
Pacific Tech, ain't you?


97
00:06:11.163 --> 00:06:12.217
Right.

98
00:06:13.476 --> 00:06:16.703
- Looks like the fishing was good.
- Have some?


99
00:06:16.912 --> 00:06:19.424
Well, I might just do that.

100
00:06:21.348 --> 00:06:22.769
It's about that meteor.

101
00:06:24.624 --> 00:06:26.772
They say it's a whopper.

102
00:06:28.957 --> 00:06:31.633
The district officer phoned us
at the lookout, up on the summit.


103
00:06:31.888 --> 00:06:33.363
I thought you might be interested.

104
00:06:33.695 --> 00:06:35.935
It's about ten or twelve miles from
here here. Over by Linda Rosa.


105
00:06:35.936 --> 00:06:38.756
Are they sure it's a meteor?
It didn't come down like one.


106
00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:41.652
That's right. It came down
kinda' in spurts, didn't it?


107
00:06:43.326 --> 00:06:46.360
Well, you fellows figure it out.
You're scientists.


108
00:06:46.562 --> 00:06:49.868
All I know, they say it's as big as
a house and practically red hot.


109
00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.447
I'd like to borrow your car and
take a look at it in the morning.


110
00:06:52.448 --> 00:06:53.674
We ought to get back.

111
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.157
- I can fly Bilder back down in your plane.
- Okay, the insurance is paid up.


112
00:06:58.271 --> 00:07:01.419
- Light?
- No, I'll smoke it later.


113
00:07:03.378 --> 00:07:04.654
<i>Don't go to close.</i>

114
00:07:05.863 --> 00:07:08.299
[Confused chatter]

115
00:07:16.093 --> 00:07:17.652
<i>Did you watch it come down?</i>

116
00:07:17.655 --> 00:07:19.879
<i>I seen it from my window.</i>

117
00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:24.689
<i>Harold, Carroll come here a minute.</i>

118
00:07:24.924 --> 00:07:28.717
<i>Step over a little. Just a
little and hold. Smile.</i>


119
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.948
It must have hit way up there, and
then skidded along the gully.


120
00:07:32.157 --> 00:07:35.201
After it stopped, all that loose
earth and stuff shook down over it.


121
00:07:35.297 --> 00:07:36.032
Excuse me.

122
00:07:36.033 --> 00:07:37.664
I guess most of it's buried.

123
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.947
That's twelve feet thick, easy. Maybe more.

124
00:07:39.948 --> 00:07:41.516
Meteors always run heavy.

125
00:07:41.542 --> 00:07:44.326
They won't be able to haul
this one away to no museum!


126
00:07:45.224 --> 00:07:48.213
It'll be a real good
attraction for Sunday drivers.


127
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.973
Better than a lion farm or snake pit.
We won't have to feed it.


128
00:07:52.053 --> 00:07:55.154
Sure, we can sell the tamales and
enchiladas and hot dogs too!


129
00:07:55.186 --> 00:07:57.192
Yeah. Ice cream, cold drinks, souvenirs!

130
00:07:57.193 --> 00:07:59.291
I think we should put
up a few picnic tables.


131
00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:01.795
Naw, naw, then they'd
bring their own lunches!


132
00:08:03.006 --> 00:08:05.653
What's the idea, Buck? 
Gonna dig for gold?

133
00:08:05.654 --> 00:08:07.235
You think you're kidding?

134
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:10.671
This is gonna be like having a
gold mine in our own back yard!


135
00:08:10.696 --> 00:08:11.806
[Laughing]

136
00:08:11.957 --> 00:08:14.388
I'm gonna get a closer look at it.

137
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.376
<i>Lucky it didn't come down
in the middle of town.</i>


138
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.673
<i>I wonder who owns this property?</i>

139
00:08:27.486 --> 00:08:28.002
[Thunk]

140
00:08:28.141 --> 00:08:29.683
That's it over there.

141
00:08:30.131 --> 00:08:32.303
It's still pretty darned hot.

142
00:08:34.364 --> 00:08:37.035
<i>- Be careful, Buck.
- Yeah, watch it Buck.</i>


143
00:08:37.117 --> 00:08:38.237
<i>Hot for ya' down there?</i>

144
00:08:39.374 --> 00:08:40.468
It's pretty hot their.

145
00:08:41.815 --> 00:08:42.377
[Clump]

146
00:08:42.746 --> 00:08:44.041
Did you see it come down?

147
00:08:44.044 --> 00:08:44.526
Yes, I was fishing up in the hills.
[Clump]


148
00:08:44.529 --> 00:08:45.627
Yes, I was fishing up in the hills.

149
00:08:45.843 --> 00:08:47.875
You must have caught plenty
with all that tackle!


150

Thank you, Doctor Forester.

Oh, colonel. Can you tell us anything
about this plane that's coming over.


1016
00:23:11.101 --> 00:23:13.467
It'll drop a flare, that's the only
way we dare put a light on them.


1017
00:23:13.493 --> 00:23:15.212
Then Air Force cameramen will get pictures.

1018

That was marine colonel Ralph Hefner.

1019
00:23:18.063 --> 00:23:20.634
There's been a lot of mysterious
activity around the machine.


1020
00:23:20.778 --> 00:23:23.379
Lights and dust, as if they
are digging themselves out.

General Mann, what d'you
think of this situation,


2366
00:39:09.853 --> 00:39:12.480
is it your opinion
the army can hold 'em?

2367
00:39:12.481 --> 00:39:16.302
You had guns and equipment going out
there all night! Weren't they enough to...


2368
00:39:16.305 --> 00:39:17.596
<i>C'mon break it up.</i>

2369
00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:21.596
The way he's hedging, maybe
the army didn't hold 'em!


2370
00:39:21.701 --> 00:39:23.706
I've seen news off the pacific cable.

Rangoon India..

nobody's stopped them yet.


2373
00:39:28.342 --> 00:39:30.916
I wanna' know, if the
city must be evacuated...


2374
00:39:30.941 --> 00:39:33.514
Were ready. Lots of people
have already moved out.


2375
00:39:33.516 --> 00:39:35.915
We've mobilized emergency
cars and busses in the yard.


2376
00:39:35.916 --> 00:39:37.423
The Red Cross is standing by.

2377
00:39:37.449 --> 00:39:39.067
For your in-formation, the
enemy is twenty-five


2378
00:39:39.068 --> 00:39:40.866
or thirty miles outside Los Angeles.

2379
00:39:40.979 --> 00:39:43.936
They're not down in force yet, but
developing. It can happen at any minute.


2380
00:39:44.199 --> 00:39:46.831
The crisis will come if they move
toward the metropolitan area...


2381
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:50.821
- Washington is on the line, sir.
- General Mann.


2382
00:39:53.003 --> 00:39:57.301
I'd say our effective losses
were 60% men, 90% material.


2383
00:39:57.916 --> 00:39:59.980
The jets went in, but not
one of them came out.


2384
00:40:00.717 --> 00:40:02.996
I watched high-level bombers
drop everything they carried.


2385
00:40:02.997 --> 00:40:04.803
They were knocked out of the
sky and the bombs did nothing.


2386
00:40:04.804 --> 00:40:06.243
Nothing was effective against them!

2387
00:40:06.871 --> 00:40:09.275
Yes, they have some sort
of electronic umbrella.


2388
00:40:09.276 --> 00:40:10.393
It's quite impenetrable.

2389
00:40:10.415 --> 00:40:12.452
Doctor Forester believes
they generate atomic force


2390
00:40:12.477 --> 00:40:14.115
without the heavy screening we use,

2391
00:40:14.116 --> 00:40:15.955
that's where they get the
power for their rays!


2392
00:40:18.553 --> 00:40:19.661
Very well, sir.

2393
00:40:19.662 --> 00:40:21.811
Call Victorville. Tell them I want
the fastest plane they've got!

You'll get all further instructions
from Sixth Army Command.

Now I'll make a statement
to those reporters.


2396
00:40:30.841 --> 00:40:33.635
All right fellas, the
General will see you now.


2397
00:40:34.495 --> 00:40:38.153
General, we heard Doctor Clayton
Forester was out there with you.


2398
00:40:38.154 --> 00:40:39.647
What's he think about this?

2399
00:40:39.648 --> 00:40:41.785
Ask him. He's back at Pacific Tech.

2400
00:40:41.786 --> 00:40:44.866
No, he's not! We tried to get him there.
He hasn't shown up.

- It's gone.

- Where are we?
- Southwest of Corona, somewhere.

There must have been another
cylinder down here.

They've been through this whole
area and cleared everybody out.

something to eat.

We're doing all right. You know I
almost forgot when I ate last.

Hay, that looks good.

2419

You know, mostly I get my meals
in coffee shops and restaurants.


2420

Don't you live at home?

2421
00:42:35.674 --> 00:42:38.300
No, on campus. 
I haven't any family.

2422
00:42:39.017 --> 00:42:42.138
I come from a big one. 
There's nine of us,

2423
00:42:42.951 --> 00:42:45.834
all in Minnesota. Except me.

2424
00:42:45.881 --> 00:42:49.422
I have no close folks. My
parents died when I was a kid.


2425
00:42:50.128 --> 00:42:52.743
A big family must be fun. I imagine...

2426
00:42:52.863 --> 00:42:54.916
I imagine it makes you feel
you belong to something.


2427
00:42:55.007 --> 00:42:58.302
It does. Maybe that's why
I feel lost right now.


2428
00:42:58.522 --> 00:43:01.971
We'll get out of here safely, don't worry.

everything that moves.

If they're mortal, they must
have mortal weaknesses.


2431

They'll be stopped, somehow!

2432
00:43:13.354 --> 00:43:17.182
I've been as close to them as anyone. But
not close enough for real observation.


2433
00:43:17.183 --> 00:43:19.694
I feel like I did one
time when I was small.


2434

Awful scared and lonesome.

2435
00:43:24.035 --> 00:43:26.766
I'd wandered off... 
I've forgotten why

2436
00:43:27.665 --> 00:43:30.699
but the family and whole crowds
of neighbors were hunting for me.


2437
00:43:32.431 --> 00:43:36.576
They found me in a church. I was
afraid to go in any place else.


2438
00:43:38.712 --> 00:43:43.620
I stayed right by the door, praying for the
one who loved me best to come and find me.


2439
00:43:49.167 --> 00:43:51.519
It was Uncle Matthew who found me.

00:43:52.497 --> 00:43:54.102
I liked him.

2441
00:43:54.808 --> 00:43:56.281
He liked you.

2442
00:43:57.678 --> 00:43:59.411
Oh, I could bawl my head off.

2443
00:43:59.493 --> 00:44:01.495
But you're not going to.
You're not the kind.

Look, you're tired.
You've been up all night.

You cracked up in a plane.
Slept in a ditch.

00:52:40.508 --> 00:52:42.889
<i>The stream of flight rose
swiftly to a torrent.</i>


3179
00:52:43.325 --> 00:52:47.200
<i>It became a giant stampede,
without order and without goal.</i>


3180
00:52:47.741 --> 00:52:52.420
<i>It was the beginning of the rout of
civilization, of the massacre of humanity.</i>


3181
00:52:52.423 --> 00:52:53.946
r

3182
00:52:58.151 --> 00:53:03.165
<i>A great silence fell over half of Europe,
as all communication was disrupted.</i>


3183
00:53:04.817 --> 00:53:07.110
<i>When the last wire photo
out of Paris reached</i>


3184
00:53:07.136 --> 00:53:09.229
<i>the French cabinet, exiled in Strasbourg</i>

3185
00:53:09.478 --> 00:53:13.156
<i>they hit upon the idea of using
super-speed jets as couriers.</i>


3186
00:53:13.157 --> 00:53:16.065
<i>Stripped of armament and
loaded with extra fuel,</i>


3187
00:53:16.066 --> 00:53:19.104
<i>these planes maintained connections
with Scandinavian countries</i>


3188
00:53:19.105 --> 00:53:22.996
<i>North Africa, the United States
and especially with England.</i>


3189
00:53:23.317 --> 00:53:25.917
<i>It was plain the martians appreciated the</i>

3190
00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:28.542
<i>strategic significance
of the British isles.</i>


3191
00:53:28.987 --> 00:53:33.874
<i>The people of Britain met the invaders
magnificently, but it was unavailing.</i>


3192
00:53:35.595 --> 00:53:37.585
<i>As the martians swept
northward toward London,</i>


3193
00:53:37.598 --> 00:53:39.598
<i>the British cabinet stayed in session,</i>

3194
00:53:39.599 --> 00:53:43.381
<i>coordinating every item of
information that could be gathered,</i>


3195
00:53:43.445 --> 00:53:46.590
<i>passing it on to the United
Nations in New York,</i>


3196
00:53:46.785 --> 00:53:49.294
<i>from there the news was
forwarded to Washington,</i>


3197
00:53:49.295 --> 00:53:53.409
<i>because here was the only remaining
unassailed strategic point.</i>


3198
00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:55.438
<i>48° North due west</i>

3199
00:53:55.923 --> 00:53:56.735
<i>31 East</i>

3200
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.695
<i>Anchored out of Kirov</i>

3201
00:53:58.683 --> 00:53:59.776
<i>Dover blanked out.</i>

3202
00:54:02.062 --> 00:54:03.255
<i>Major Bently Dauton.</i>

3203
00:54:03.692 --> 00:54:05.312
<i>Report to General Mann</i>

3204
00:54:05.434 --> 00:54:07.225
<i>Teléfono para El Coronel José Martínez</i>

3205
00:54:08.038 --> 00:54:09.425
Teléfono número once.

3206
00:54:10.248 --> 00:54:12.477
<i>80 west by 38 north</i>

3207
00:54:14.346 --> 00:54:15.963
<i>Contact civil authorities.</i>

3208
00:54:18.004 --> 00:54:19.409
Capitaine...

3209
00:54:21.898 --> 00:54:22.966
And this much is certain.

3210
00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:27.715
It's vital to prevent the martian
machines from linking up.


3211
00:54:27.875 --> 00:54:31.467
Once they do, they adopt an
extraordinary military tactic.


3212
00:54:31.695 --> 00:54:35.427
They form a Crescent,
anchor it at one end

3213
00:54:36.415 --> 00:54:40.081
and sweep on until they've
cleared a quadrant.


3214
00:54:40.627 --> 00:54:44.662
Then they anchor the opposite
end and reverse direction.


3215
00:54:45.594 --> 00:54:48.206
They slash across country like scythes,

3216
00:54:48.318 --> 00:54:50.596
wiping out everything that's
trying to get away from them.


3217
00:54:50.621 --> 00:54:54.060
That's explains why communications is cut
the moment their machines begin moving.


3218
00:54:54.061 --> 00:54:57.156
Montreal's blacked out. Nothing
more has come through.


3219
00:54:57.157 --> 00:54:58.805
The same thing that happened
on our pacific coast.


3220
00:54:58.806 --> 00:54:59.801
Anything from them yet?

3221
00:54:59.802 --> 00:55:03.033
No, Mr. secretary. We've had nothing
from San Francisco for over five hours.


3222
00:55:03.042 --> 00:55:04.509
Excuse me gentlemen,

3223
00:55:04.807 --> 00:55:06.504
here's that Los Angeles picture, sir.

3224
00:55:06.505 --> 00:55:09.337
This is a Sonic radar picture
taken from extreme altitude.


3225
00:55:09.646 --> 00:55:12.664
It shows full details of the
martian nest outside Los Angeles.


3226
00:55:13.326 --> 00:55:15.872
Their machines appear as round blobs.

3227
00:55:16.543 --> 00:55:18.873
Newly fallen cylinders are elongated.

3228
00:55:19.878 --> 00:55:25.470
We know there are three cylinders to each
group, three machines to each cylinder.


3229
00:55:29.669 --> 00:55:32.500
All right, I've seen enough.

3230
00:55:34.249 --> 00:55:36.620
Theirs only one thing
will stop the martians!


3231
00:55:36.781 --> 00:55:39.299
We've held back because of the
danger of radiation to civilians.


3232
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:44.870
Now there's no choice. The white house will
confirm an order to use the atom bomb.


3233
00:55:45.076 --> 00:55:48.856
Then our first target will be the initial
landing place outside Los Angeles.


3234
00:55:49.455 --> 00:55:52.851
First thing you get there, arrange for the
Pacific Tech scientist to monitor the drop.


3235
00:55:52.876 --> 00:55:55.939
I'll send wire orders ahead of you and
have the area cleared all around.


3236
00:55:59.347 --> 00:56:01.528
We've still time to hit them before dark.

3237
00:56:02.481 --> 00:56:05.311
Then we'll blast them all over the world.

3238
00:56:11.882 --> 00:56:13.736
Forester, everybody's
been looking for you!


3239
00:56:13.762 --> 00:56:15.471
I know. We've walked halfway from Corona!

3240
00:56:15.472 --> 00:56:17.439
Finally found an abandoned truck.

3241
00:56:18.092 --> 00:56:22.343
This is Miss Van Buren. Dr. Grotzman,
Dr. Pryor, James, Bilderbeck.


3242
00:56:22.345 --> 00:56:23.791
What's this I hear about the A-bomb?

3243
00:56:23.817 --> 00:56:26.009
We've been assigned a special detail
we're going in right after it.


3244
00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:28.251
- Study its effect.
- We leave in half an hour.


3245
00:56:28.252 --> 00:56:30.456
- What's that?
- A king-size fish eye?


3246
00:56:30.457 --> 00:56:31.832
This is an electronic eye.

3247
00:56:32.088 --> 00:56:34.136
The martians modeled it
after their own eye.


3248
00:56:34.137 --> 00:56:36.280
They use it the
way we use a periscope.

3249
00:56:36.773 --> 00:56:38.731
It'll tell us a lot about
their metals and alloys.


3250
00:56:38.732 --> 00:56:41.903
If this is actually a lens, we can
find out about their optics.


3251
00:56:42.027 --> 00:56:44.576
- Interesting, very interesting.
- And this...


3252
00:56:46.111 --> 00:56:47.490
The blood of a martian.

3253
00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:53.765
I don't remember ever seeing blood
crystals as anemic as these.


3254
00:56:55.338 --> 00:56:57.316
They may be mental giants,

3255
00:56:58.081 --> 00:57:03.002
but by our standards, physically,
they must be very primitive.


3256
00:57:04.186 --> 00:57:08.339
Isn't it curious how everything
about them seems to be in threes?


3257
00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:12.272
Their eyes have three lenses and three
distinct pupils, strong light shocks them.


3258
00:57:12.273 --> 00:57:13.651
They're not accustomed to it!

3259
00:57:13.771 --> 00:57:17.555
Sunlight on Mars is approximately
half as strong as we get it.


3260
00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:21.725
Add their clouds and dust, it amounts
to no more than our twilight.


3261
00:57:24.058 --> 00:57:25.830
Now, if you'll step over here please.

3262
00:57:27.269 --> 00:57:31.529
We've rigged the epidiascope to reflect
whatever the martian lens picks up.


3263
00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:38.089
Move in a little. Thank you.

Time we got started, gentlemen.

Let's go.

3396
00:58:55.864 --> 00:58:59.677
That's martian blood. Let's make a quick
analysis and see what we've got!


3397
00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:02.389
- It might give us something.
- Something we could use.


3398
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:04.379
Oh, let it go. If you're
interested in martian blood,


3399
00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:06.778
you'll get all you want right
after the plane drops the bomb!


3400
00:59:08.727 --> 00:59:10.797
The Flying Wing is going to carry it.

3401
00:59:20.104 --> 00:59:23.851
Hello tower, this is Air Force Flying
Wing, ready for take-off. Over.


3402
00:59:24.076 --> 00:59:27.621
<i>Flying Wing, this is the tower.
Clear for take-off. Over</i>


3403
00:59:27.622 --> 00:59:29.782
Wish us luck. Roger.

3404
00:59:35.124 --> 00:59:42.865
Q

3405
00:59:55.526 --> 00:59:59.913
The target for the A-bomb is this nest
of martian machines in the Puente Hills


3406
01:00:00.122 --> 01:00:03.469
where more of these meteors cylinders
came down early last evening.


3407
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:07.457
A plane will pinpoint the target
for the drop from six miles up.


3408
01:00:07.458 --> 01:00:09.986
We have been warned that
this bomb is ten times


3409
01:00:09.987 --> 01:00:12.614
more powerful than
anything previously used.


3410
01:00:12.793 --> 01:00:15.029
It's the latest thing in nuclear fission.

3411
01:00:15.131 --> 01:00:17.872
Nothing like this has ever
been exploded before.


3412
01:00:17.873 --> 01:00:19.914
And we're going to be pretty darn close,

3413
01:00:20.089 --> 01:00:23.264
but there are observers down in
the valley in a forward bunker


3414
01:00:23.427 --> 01:00:25.204
and they'll be a lot nearer than us!

3415
01:00:25.462 --> 01:00:30.447
The whole world is waiting. For this
will decide the fate of civilization.


3416
01:00:30.679 --> 01:00:32.059
All humanity...

3417
01:00:32.743 --> 01:00:36.179
Whether we live or die may
depend on what happens here.


3418
01:00:36.434 --> 01:00:40.857
U<i>Attention, please, four
minutes to bomb time!</i>


3419
01:00:41.897 --> 01:00:44.331
<i>There must be a couple of
million people back of</i>


3420
01:00:44.332 --> 01:00:47.535
<i>us in the shelter of the San
Gabriel hills. Waiting...</i>


3421
01:00:47.696 --> 01:00:50.491
<i>Waiting to find out whether
they can go home again.</i>


3422
01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:54.440
<i>Everywhere all around the world, people
have been driven from their homes.</i>


3423
01:00:54.604 --> 01:00:57.905
Direct cable communication is
being maintained with Washington,


3424
01:00:58.143 --> 01:01:00.089
but there's no radio at all.

3425
01:01:00.105 --> 01:01:03.548
Not even with the bombing
plane that's coming over.


3426
01:01:03.639 --> 01:01:05.511
All radio is dead,

3427
01:01:06.968 --> 01:01:09.970
which means that these tape
recordings I'm making


3428
01:01:09.971 --> 01:01:13.686
are for the sake
of future history, if any.

3429
01:01:14.792 --> 01:01:16.428
"Future history," he said.

3430
01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:20.580
Yes, "if any."

3431
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:32.972
Bilderbeck has calculated
how long we have got


3432
01:01:32.998 --> 01:01:35.429
until martians take over the entire world.

3433
01:01:35.464 --> 01:01:37.830
If the A-bomb fails, that is.

3434
01:01:37.831 --> 01:01:41.853
The martians can conquer
the earth in six days.


3435
01:01:42.256 --> 01:01:44.854
The same number of days
it took to create it.


3436
01:01:51.212 --> 01:01:55.010

3439

Hello! Hello, there! 
What can you see?

3465
01:03:50.617 --> 01:03:52.149
There's something moving!

3466
01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:05.046
They haven't even been touched!

3467
01:04:14.661 --> 01:04:16.248
It didn't stop them.

3468
01:04:16.712 --> 01:04:20.367
Guns, tanks, bombs, they're
like toys against them!


3469
01:04:20.446 --> 01:04:23.833
It'll end only one way. We're beaten.

No... not yet.

3471
01:04:30.275 --> 01:04:31.974
Washington issued orders:

3472
01:04:31.975 --> 01:04:34.770
In event the A-bomb failed, evacuate
all cities in danger of attack


3473
01:04:35.108 --> 01:04:36.885
they'll be moving on Los Angeles now!

3474
01:04:37.442 --> 01:04:40.279
We'll establish a line and fight them
all the way back to the mountains.

Our best hope lies in what you
people can develop to help us.

3478

a base laboratory in the rocky mountains.

3482
01:05:02.807 --> 01:05:05.098
It'll give us time to search out
some weakness in the martians.


3483
01:05:05.099 --> 01:05:07.577
A forlorn hope, but there is a chance.

3484
01:05:07.709 --> 01:05:09.715
We may get a
lead from the anemic blood.
