1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.180
Do you want
to see what the world is really like? Yes,


2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.180
I find the world a complicated place.

3
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:08.980
Three.

4
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.540
We imagine a future, too,
in our imaginings horrify us.


5
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.340
Stop.

6
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.780
There's going to be some changes made.

7
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.100
I love people so much.

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.260
It's hard for me
to be a little fella.

9
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.940
I need you here.

10
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.540
People want to love you.

11
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.540
You should let them love all of you.

12
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.420
Humans only have one ending.

13
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.700
Ideas do forever.

14
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.620
Imagine
knowing that you could do something


15
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.140
that only you could do.

16
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.580
The world.

17
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.500
But remember this day.

18
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.260
Close your eyes.

19
00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Now. Feel.

20
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.140
You're so beautiful.

21
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.540
I know.

22
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.860
I was just thinking that

23
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.860
I haven't eaten in three weeks.

24
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.980
I'm so hungry.

25
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.740
I have to go host the Oscars.

26
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.900
Live from the Dome

27
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.700
in Hollywood.

28
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:42.700
Please welcome tonight's
host, Jimmy Kimmel.


29
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.740
Hi, everybody.

30
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.260
Well, it's very nice.

31
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.340
Thank you.

32
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.980
Thank you very much.

33
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.380
Thank you for that partial
standing ovation.


34
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.260
And welcome to the 96th Oscars, everybody.

35
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.620
Look at these beautiful human actors.

36
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.220
What an honor it is to be here.

37
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.580
Thank you for having me back.

38
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.580
And congratulations
to each and every one of you


39
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.340
for making it to the Academy Awards
and for making it on time.


40
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.940
The show, as you know,
is starting an hour early this year.


41
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.860
But don't worry,
it will still and very, very late.


42
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.540
In fact, we're already 5 minutes over.

43
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.900
And I am not joking.

44
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.500
I'm not going to lie.

45
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.060
It's going to be a long night after
what was a long year.


46
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.060
It was a hard year,
but it was also a great year for movies.


47
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.100
Despite the fact that everything
stopped the people in this room


48
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.940
somehow managed to come up
with so many excellent films


49
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.060
and so many memorable performances.

50
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.700
This night is full of enormous talent and
untold potential, but so was Madam Web.


51
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.740
So who knows?

52
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.660
Are we off to a bumpy start?

53
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.740
Okay.

54
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.340
This is a meaningful occasion
for most of you.


55
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.260
I know that.

56
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.420
And I know that winning an Oscar

57
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.300
is something you dreamed about
since you were a kid.


58
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.900
And now here we are,
all dressed up, celebrating


59
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.940
the best of the best, beginning
with the biggest movie of the year.


60
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.740
Barbie.

61
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.660
Barbie was a monster hit.

62
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.620
What a thing.

63
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.900
What an achievement to take a plastic doll
nobody even liked anymore.


64
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.260
I mean, my wife.

65
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.420
Before this movie,

66
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.220
you'd have had a better chance
of getting my wife to buy our daughter


67
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.820
a pack of Marlboro
Reds than a Barbie doll.


68
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.380
Now, Barbie's a feminist icon, thanks to

69
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.140
Greta Gerwig, who many believe deserved
to be nominated for best director.


70
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.980
Hello.

71
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.740
I know you're clapping,
but you're the ones who didn't vote for


72
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.020
her, by the way.

73
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.940
Don't
act like you had nothing to do with this.


74
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.260
And I don't want to leave out Margot.

75
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.900
Robbie.

76
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.460
Margot, put this giant hit together. Me?

77
00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.420
You did? Margot.

78
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.340
Robbie and Ryan Gosling are here tonight.

79
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.940
Look, kids, it's Barbie and Ken sitting
just near each other.


80
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.780
Ryan.

81
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.460
Margot, I want you to know that
even if neither one of you wins


82
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.060
the Oscar tonight, you've both already won
something much more important.


83
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.700
The genetic lottery.

84
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.980
Ryan, you are so hot.

85
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.020
Let's go camping together
and not tell our wives.


86
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.220
And then we have the other major
box office winner This year,


87
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.500
Oppenheimer
directed by the great Christopher


88
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.540
Nolan, also a very attractive man.

89
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.900
And this
is a very it's a fascinating person.


90
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.540
Christopher
Nolan doesn't have a smartphone.


91
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.020
He doesn't use email.

92
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.420
He and he writes his scripts on a computer
with no Internet connection,


93
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.620
which is a powerful way of saying,
I will not allow my porn addiction


94
00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.100
to get in the way of my work.

95
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.100
Christopher is joined by his longtime

96
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.780
collaborator, Kilian Murphy,
who is just wonderful.


97
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.380
Kilian is

98
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.180
interesting fact about his name.

99
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.500
It's pronounced Kilian.

100
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.580
When he does drama.

101
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.420
When he does comedy, it's Cillian

102
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.140
and congratulate Sicilians costar
Robert Downey Jr, who is this


103
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.900
night is

104
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.860
this is the highest point

105
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.260
of Robert Downey
Junior's long and illustrious career.


106
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.220
Well, one of the highest points,

107
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:40.860
but Robert has been a

108
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:47.060
was too
on the nose was out a drug motion you may


109
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.860
but look at him

110
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.860
I mean look at this guy He's so handsome,
so talented.


111
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.500
He's won every award there is to win.

112
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.060
Is that an acceptance
speech in your pocket or do you just have


113
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:04.380
a very rectangular penis?

114
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.940
What a story.

115
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.580
Not even 20 years ago, things
weren't going that great for Robert.


116
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.980
He played the villain.

117
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.620
And correct me if I have this wrong

118
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.660
in a movie
where Tim Allen turns into a dog, Right?


119
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.020
And if you ever decide to remake that
film, I'm


120
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.700
just the guy to
play Tim Allen that is.

121
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.380
Where is he?

122
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.780
Messy, who,

123
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.340
even though he's a dog,

124
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.700
may have given the performance of the year
in Anatomy of a Fall mess?


125
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.500
He has an overdose scene.

126
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.340
If you've seen it, you know,
it is incredible.


127
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:42.140
Honestly, I haven't seen a French actor
eat vomit like that since Gerard Depardieu,

128
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.300
the second
most nominated movie of the year


129
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.700
is Poor Things,
directed by Yorgos Lanthimos,


130
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.300
various.

131
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.980
Not only is Yorgos

132
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.540
nominated for best director, his editor,
whose name is also Yorgos.


133
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.460
Yorgos Rob. Sarita is nominated too.

134
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:07.860
We have to Yorgos
is in the house tonight.

135
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.460
Will they both win?

136
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:15.540
Yorgos is as good as mine.

137
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.020
All right,

138
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.540
let's get 20 seconds for room tone.

139
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.340
Emma Stone is an Oscar
nominee for a fifth time, right?


140
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.140
The fifth time this year.

141
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.860
And she is. Emma, you are.

142
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.260
You are so unbelievably
great in four things.


143
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.180
Emma played an adult woman
with the brain of a child like the lady


144
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:40.340
who gave the rebuttal to the State
of the Union on Thursday night and.


145
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.940
And you were just amazing.

146
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.820
There are so many great movies
that held audiences captive this year,


147
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.260
and I mean that literally.

148
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.500
Your movies were too long this year.

149
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.380
The average length of the top
ten movies was 2 hours and 23 minutes.


150
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.380
That's up 30 minutes from three years ago.

151
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.420
When I went to see Killers of the Flower
Moon.


152
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.460
I had my mail forwarded to the theater.

153
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.100
Killers of the

154
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.100
Flower Moon is so long
in the time it takes you to watch it,


155
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:11.580
you could drive to Oklahoma
and solve the murder of yourself.


156
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.500
The multi-talented Brad
Bradley Cooper is here with us


157
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.900
tonight with his He's
got another best picture nominee.


158
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.460
Maestro Bradley,
you brought your mom to the show tonight.


159
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.300
Hi, Mrs. Cooper. How are you?

160
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.260
You're doing good. Great.

161
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.500
Bradley brings his mother to every award
show, right?


162
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.500
Who's dated last year at the Oscars
at not Okay, but


163
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.100
and the Tonys
and the Soul Train Awards, etc..


164
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.020
It's very sweet.

165
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.620
But I guess the question is,
how many times can one bring his mom


166
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.980
as his date
before he is actually dating his mom?


167
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.700
Are you working on a movie
about Freud right now and not telling us?


168
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.140
Here's some fun Oscar trivia.

169
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.620
48 years ago, Robert De Niro and Jodie
Foster were nominated


170
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.780
for Taxi Driver
and they are both nominated again tonight.


171
00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.820
1976 was the

172
00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:11.860
one that's 23.

173
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.180
In 1976,

174
00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.180
Jodie Foster is young enough
to be Robert De Niro's daughter.


175
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:24.460
Now she's 20 years too
old to be his girlfriend.


176
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.700
I also want to congratulate Robert's
costar Lily Gladstone,


177
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.100
who is the first Native American ever

178
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.660
to be nominated for best actress

179
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.500
and see

180
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.900
for Killers of the Flower Moon.

181
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.420
And if you saw it, you know,
that year was riveting.


182
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.620
And did you know that
before she got this movie,


183
00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.940
Lily was ready to quit acting
and take a job at the Department


184
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.180
of Agriculture
tracking murder Hornets, right?


185
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:49.860
Yeah.

186
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.940
And now she's nominated for an Oscar,
which is so great for her,


187
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.620
but also makes me worry that no one's
tracking these murder hornets.


188
00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.980
Lily is an excellent company.

189
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.780
We have many first time acting nominees
tonight, including Emily Blunt,


190
00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.860
Jeffrey Wright, 
Sterling K Brown,

191
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.060
America Ferrera, America.

192
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.900
Daniel Brooks, 
Colman Domingo,

193
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.820
David Joy Randolph, and Sandra Bullock.

194
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.380
For the first time
ever, three foreign language films are up


195
00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:25.100
for best Picture, and two of them
star Sandra Huler, which is


196
00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.860
in Sandra

197
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.380
two movie Sandra plays a woman on trial
for murdering her husband


198
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.660
in Anatomy of a Fall

199
00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:38.420
and a Nazi housewife living
next to Auschwitz in the zone of interest.


200
00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.060
And while these are very heavy subjects
for American moviegoers


201
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:49.340
in Sandra's native Germany,
they're called romcoms.


202
00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.500
For the first time in

203
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.620
more than two decades,
we're adding a new category to the Oscars.


204
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.340
Not tonight.

205
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:54.860
Don't worry.

206
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:59.060
In the future, they will be adding
an Oscar for achievement in casting,


207
00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:04.940
which, yeah,
you better you'd better applaud for that.


208
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.900
And that is great news for actors
because now not only will be able


209
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.180
to watch someone else win
an Oscar for a part you didn't get,


210
00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.660
you'll also be able to watch the person
who didn't think you were right for it.


211
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.540
Win one, too.

212
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:17.580
What a year we've had.

213
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.580
It was a tough year.

214
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:28.100
Remember that kid from the fable means
this is what he looks like now.


215
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:32.500
Very good to have you here, Steven.

216
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.380
Stephen, are you nominated tonight
or are you here because you have season


217
00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.380
tickets?

218
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.020
Steven and his wife,
Kate Capshaw, donated a lot of money


219
00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.020
to help actors and writers
who are out of work over the summer.


220
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.420
We were on strike for a long time
for 148 days.


221
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.540
For five months,
this group of writers, actors,


222
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.940
directors, the people actually make
the film said, We will not accept a deal.


223
00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.220
Well, not the directors.

224
00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.740
You guys folded immediately,
but the rest of us


225
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.620
said we will not accept the deal
without protections


226
00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.500
against artificial intelligence.

227
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:11.060
And as a result, actors no longer have
to worry about getting replaced by A.I..


228
00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.980
Thanks to this historic agreement,
actors are now able to go back


229
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.100
to worrying about being replaced
by younger, more attractive people.


230
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.100
And I think that's great. And writers.

231
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.500
I have written Transformers
Rise of the Beasts.


232
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.780
Yes, the answer is yes.

233
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.420
We learned a lot
while we were out on those picket lines.


234
00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.620
This strike raised existential questions
about our industry,


235
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:37.340
like if a movie premieres at The Grove and
there are no actors there to promote it.


236
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:41.540
Does Mario Lopez make us sound?

237
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.340
And now that the strike is over,

238
00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.820
now that Fran Drescher

239
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.700
has returned to her volunteer work,
reading loudly to the hearing impaired,


240
00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:53.580
we can be proud of the fact that this long
and difficult work stoppage taught us


241
00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.460
that this very strange town of ours,
as pretentious


242
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.980
and superficial as it can be at its heart,
is a union town.


243
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.860
It's not just a bunch of heavily
Botoxed, Hailey, Bieber, smoothie,


244
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:09.100
drinking, diabetes, prescription
abusing, gluten sensitive nympho


245
00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.100
babies
with perpetually shivering Chihuahuas.


246
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.260
This is a coalition of strong,
hardworking,


247
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.660
mentally tough American laborers,
women and men who had 100%


248
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:24.180
for sure die if we even had to
touch the handle of a shovel.


249
00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.020
But the reason we were
able to make a deal

250
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.060
is because of the people
who rally beside us.


251
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.940
So before we celebrate ourselves,

252
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.340
let's have a very well deserved
round of applause for the people who work


253
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:38.780
behind the scenes the Teamsters,
the truck drivers, the lighting for sound


254
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.500
gaffers, grips.

255
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.500
That's why all the people refused
to cross the picket lines.


256
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.500
Here they are.

257
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.700
If you're wearing Sketchers to the Oscars,
take a bow.


258
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.460
Come on, guys.

259
00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.620
Take a bow.

260
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.660
Applebaum, you deserve it.

261
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:59.260
Thank you for standing with us.

262
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:05.740
And also, we want you to know that

263
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:06.900
in your upcoming

264
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.580
negotiations, we will stand with you, too.

265
00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:14.500
And also, I'm going to make sure
this show was really long tonight.


266
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.300
So you get a ton of overtime.

267
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.380
It's golden time, everybody.

268
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.460
Should we give out some Oscars?

269
00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.060
All right.

270
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.740
We have surprises planned

271
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.220
for each of the acting categories tonight,
five surprises, in fact.


272
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:35.540
And we're going to kick it off with
the Oscar for actress in a supporting role


273
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.780
in the Oscar days

274
00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:41.420
to Mary Steenburgen, Lupita Nyong'o,
Jamie Lee,


275
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:51.500
Rita moreno, Regina King.

276
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.460
So I am thrilled to
be back on this stage

277
00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.260
to present this year's
best Supporting Actress Oscar.


278
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.740
And I am beyond proud
to be able to talk

279
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.860
about one of my besties

280
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:29.420
so inspired
Jodie Foster brings a physical intensity


281
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.660
coupled with deep concern
and care as Bonnie Stoll to Diana


282
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:40.060
Nyad's fierce best friend,
motivator and serious ask kicker.


283
00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.820
And speaking from personal experience,

284
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.900
All of those qualities are very real about
Jodie as well.


285
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.980
There is no one you would
rather have your back


286
00:15:51.060 --> 00:16:01.060
than the multitalented Jodie Foster

287
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:08.260
in the last moments of Oppenheimer.

288
00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.580
Emily Blunt character Kitty Fisher.

289
00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.940
Oppenheimer refuses to shake the offered

290
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.260
hand of the man who betrayed her husband.

291
00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:23.540
Though it was years later,
her eyes have lost none of their fury.


292
00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.180
If you saw only that extraordinary moment,

293
00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:30.620
you wouldn't know why
Emily Blunt is nominated tonight.


294
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.540
Emily, I am so
proud to be your friend.

295
00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.780
And I am shaking my head in wonder
at the beautiful,


296
00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.980
heartbreaking
and hell bent DAX that you brave to play.


297
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:52.980
Kitty Oppenheimer.

298
00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:55.980
When we meet

299
00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.980
Mary in the cafeteria in the hold overs,

300
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.980
we can feel the unspoken
grief simmering under her surface.


301
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:08.500
Divine, my friend,
your performance is a tribute


302
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:13.100
to those who have helped others
heal in spite of their own pain.


303
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:17.660
It's also a tribute to your grandmother,
whose glasses you wore in the film.


304
00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:27.740
What an honor to see the world
through her eyes and yours,


305
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:42.300
America.

306
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.980
Maddie. God,

307
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.220
you're powerful.

308
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:53.740
Barbie monologue is
perhaps the most talked about moment


309
00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:58.100
in the most
talked about movie of the past year.


310
00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.220
Your words

311
00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.860
and the passion
with which you deliver them


312
00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.500
about the most impossible standards

313
00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:14.500
females must try to live up to galvanized
not only women,


314
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.580
but everyone with a pulse of

315
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.780
America

316
00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.340
from one woman to another.

317
00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:32.340
Congratulations on your tour de force.

318
00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:41.220
Danielle Brooks.

319
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.300
When you were 15 and saw The Color

320
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:48.220
Purple on Broadway with your father,
a spark ignited in you.


321
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.620
And that spark brought you here today

322
00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.940
from making your Broadway
debut ten years later as Sophia, too.


323
00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:59.300
Almost ten years after that, giving

324
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.780
this transcendent performance
on the big screen.


325
00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.860
We don't just see Sophia's strength,

326
00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.100
but we see her vulnerability as well.

327
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.460
You you have earned this

328
00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:21.460
full circle moment, my friend.

329
00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:30.300
And the Oscar goes to divine.

330
00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:40.220
So this is the first Oscar win

331
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:50.260
and nomination for Deadline's award
winning


332
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:16.180
God is so good.

333
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.780
God is so good.

334
00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:22.660
You know, I am

335
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.420
I didn't think I was supposed
to be doing this as a career.


336
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.820
I started off as a singer

337
00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.380
and my mother said to me,

338
00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.940
Go across the street
to that theater department.


339
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.980
There's something for you there.

340
00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.660
And I thank my mother for doing that.

341
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.740
I thank you to all the people
who have stepped in my path


342
00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:49.620
and has been there for me,
who has ushered me and guided me.


343
00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.580
I am so grateful to all you
beautiful people out here


344
00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.980
for for so long.

345
00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.820
I've always wanted to be different.

346
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:03.140
And now I realize
I just need to pinch myself.


347
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.300
And I thank you.

348
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.260
I thank you for seeing me,

349
00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:08.860
Rhonda.

350
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.260
Then, Lou, I thank you.

351
00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.860
Well,
I was the only black girl in that class


352
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.380
when you saw me
and you told me I was enough.


353
00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.260
And when I told you I don't see myself,
you said, That's fine.


354
00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.100
We're going to forge our own path.

355
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.340
You're going to lay a trail for yourself.

356
00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:33.060
I am so grateful to all the women
who have been by my side.


357
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:38.260
Colleen Kemp, Barbara
Broccoli, Tracy Brennan, Sarah Fargo.


358
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.620
I have to give a special
shout out to my publicist.


359
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.180
And I know y'all said don't say that,
but no publicist.


360
00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:48.260
But you don't have a publicist
like I have a publicist.


361
00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.740
You have been by my side
of the entire thing.


362
00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.780
And I am forever grateful.

363
00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.780
I pray to God that I get to do this
more than once.


364
00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.780
I thank you for seeing me
have a blessed night.


365
00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:09.780
Thank you so much.

366
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.580
Coming up next,

367
00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:18.380
Chris Hemsworth
and Anya TAYLOR-JOY gets the Oscar.


368
00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.140
Live from the Dolby Theater at Ovation

369
00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:31.140
Hollywood,

370
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.340
please.

371
00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:37.820
It's Christmas.

372
00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.060
At least pretend to be a human being.

373
00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.220
Do you think I
want to be babysitting you?

374
00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.220
I could have been spending the rest
of my vacation reading mystery novels.


375
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:49.100
You don't tell a boy
that's been left behind at Christmas


376
00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.180
that you're going to cut him loose.

377
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.620
I find the world
a bitter and complicated place.


378
00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.780
I think you and
I have this in common.

379
00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:58.940
You can do this.

380
00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:08.820
You know,
I was going to tell you something.


381
00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.380
And Baba Vali to you.

382
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:11.500
Good, sir.

383
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.660
And by the way, congratulations.

384
00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.180
The day by Joy Randolph.

385
00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.580
That was about your Oscar.

386
00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.660
Very sweet, beautiful speech.

387
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.940
You know, you forgot to mention
your publicist's name.


388
00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.060
I think

389
00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:30.500
your publicist needs a publicist,
is what it is.


390
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:34.900
Yeah.

391
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:35.540
Okay.

392
00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:39.980
You shouldn't have to pay
for the rest of the year at least.


393
00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.580
Great story about Divine.

394
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.340
Divine.

395
00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.940
Had to learn how to smoke for her
role in the holdovers.


396
00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:48.500
Her director, Alexander Payne,
mailed her boxes of fake cigarets


397
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.340
so she could practice
when she didn't think the fake ones look.


398
00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:51.860
Right. Right.

399
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.340
So she started smoking real cigarets.

400
00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.140
And now she has an Oscar.

401
00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:00.780
You see, kids, sometimes smoking is fine.

402
00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.940
And by the way, 
I do want to say,

403
00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:06.380
for those of you who do not win an Oscar,
I need you to stick around.


404
00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.820
After the show,
we'll be giving out the silver Oscars


405
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:13.300
for second place
after an all new Abbott Elementary.


406
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.380
So please stay.

407
00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:18.420
Our next awards are for animated feature
and animated short.


408
00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:22.380
Raise your hand if you let your kid
fill out this part of the ballot.


409
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.060
Okay, good is not allowed.

410
00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:24.860
Please welcome

411
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:34.860
the God of Thunder and Princess Peach,
Chris Hemsworth and Anya TAYLOR-JOY.


412

The very Oscars Comic
-Con

413
00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:45.020
and I.

414
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:45.980
That's all it is.

415
00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:55.980
A leap of faith.

416
00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.740
Okay.

417
00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:04.260
Animated films.

418
00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.940
Sometimes they pull on your heartstrings,
and other times they make you laugh


419
00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.260
and bring you joy.

420
00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.540
This year's nominees for Best
animated Short come from countries

for first time nominee Brad Bowker

438
00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:21.940
Okay.

439
00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:25.500
Intimidating.

440
00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:25.900
We want

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.100
Elemental.

475
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.020
Peter Stone and Denise Frame,

476
00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:17.020
Nimona, Nick Bruno, Troy Kline,

477
00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.140
Karen Ryan and Julie Zachary.

478
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.580
Robot Trace.

479
00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.820
Pablo Bianca.

480
00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.820
Even comments on Ignacio Stop

481
00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.060
and Sandra Tapia Diaz

482
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.100
Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse
Kemp Powers,


483
00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:40.860
Justin, Kate Thompson, Phil Lord,
Christopher Miller and Amy Pascal.


484
00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:41.620
All right.

485
00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:48.860
And the Oscar goes to
the boy in the hair

486
00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.500
and the heroines

487
00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:54.660
Hayao Miyazaki and Toshio
Suzuki cannot be here with us tonight.


488
00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.860
So we accept this Oscar on their behalf.

489
00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:06.860
Congratulations.

490
00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.100
Just ahead.

491
00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.460
Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer.

492
00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.900
Then later, Billie Eilish performs
a nominated storm song from Barbie.


493
00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:27.420
It's the Oscars here on ABC.

494
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.940
And we must experience everything,

495
00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:35.020
not just the food,

496
00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:39.780
but degradation of that happiness.

497
00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.100
This makes us hopeful

498
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.900
and reaching out that we're

499
00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.220
a living.

500
00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.220
And the world.

501
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.540
The world is ours.

502
00:29:51.620 --> 00:30:01.500
I am finding being a life fascinating.

503
00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.260
Those were all the parts of four

504
00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:07.060
things we're allowed to show on TV.

505
00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:10.140
I'm not really the boy in the hair
and people couldn't make it.


506
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:15.260
I mean, I could see maybe the boy
not showing up, but the parents should be here.

507
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:15.700
All right.

508
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:20.340
Next, Oscars are for Best Original
and Adapted Screenplay,


509
00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:24.100
which is actually
a controversial category this year


510
00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.820
because a lot of people want to know at
what age do you tell a screenplay?


511
00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.220
It was adapted.

512
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.740
Our next presenters have been

513
00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:37.020
best friends for almost 30 years,
and that all ends tonight.


514
00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:41.420
Please welcome two time Oscar nominee
Melissa McCarthy and Oscar winner


515
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:51.500
Octavia Spencer.

516
00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:57.340
The original screenplays

517
00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.340
and adapted
screenplays are cut from the same cloth.


518
00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.020
They're similar. 
Yet they remain unique.

519
00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:07.580
Yet each artform maintains
its individual characteristics.


520
00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.300
Kind of like us, right?

521
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.020
I mean, we do our old things.

522
00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.060
We also do our things together.

523
00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:17.180
We're like the Chippendale
of showbiz, right?


524
00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:17.740
Yeah. Yeah.

525
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:22.940
I don't see us as the Lycra pant
pelvic thrust type.


526
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.500
Well, speak for yourself.

527
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.340
But what are you telling me?
I said Chippendale.


528
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:28.780
You said Chippendales? No.

529
00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:29.860
Oh, no.

530
00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.180
I mean Chip and Dale. Chip in.

531
00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.260
Come, Dale.
And you're saying Chippendales.


532
00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:38.940
So I thought you were saying in nails.

533
00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.140
Chip and Dale.

534
00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:44.020
Well, usually
I am saying it one day, but not.


535
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.860
Not now because it's. 
That would be weird.

536
00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:51.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Why don't we just

537
00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.460
read what
the brilliant writers wrote for us?


538
00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.140
Oh. Oh.

539
00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.700
Look, I know that there's a

540
00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.220
there's a script on the thing,
and it has my name up there. Look at.


541
00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:02.020
Oh, it's in yellow. Yes.

542
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.700
To make a script really come to life,
the writer must not only capture


543
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:12.260
the audience's hearts, but take MONTAGNE
Easily entertain and surprise.


544
00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.740
Wow. That is better when it's much better.

545
00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.420
It's better written, much better.

546
00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.060
Better in guys, 
Much better written.

547
00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:24.100
Here are the nominees
for Best Original Screenplay,

549
00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:30.460
And our tour around. 
You are not a victim.

550
00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.500
Not at all.

551
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:37.020
Your generosity conceals
something dirtier and meaner.


552
00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:40.100
The holdovers written by David Hanson.

553
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.740
I can't tell this class.

554
00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.420
Oh, don't sell yourself short, Mr. Coach.

555
00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.460
I truly believe that you can.

556
00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:49.020
Maestro,
written by Bradley Cooper and Josh Singer.


557
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.340
Know I spoke to both your parents.

558
00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.300
Too much is too much.

559
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:53.980
I love too much.

560
00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:54.580
What can I say?

561
00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:55.820
But I'm reading it in.

562
00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:59.140
I'm reading it in May December.

563
00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.780
Screenplay by Sami Birch.

564
00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:03.340
Story by Sami Birch and Alex Mechanic.

565
00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:07.900
Insecure people are very dangerous,
aren't they?


566
00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:10.540
I'm secure Past Lives.

567
00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:15.500
Written by Celine
Dion, ten years old and struggling man.


568
00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:16.340
I don't know.

569
00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:21.940
Plus, it's for that.

570
00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.020
And the Oscar goes to

571
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:34.620
Anatomy of a fall guy.

572
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.860
This is the first Oscar

573
00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.860
win for the Steam train
and our crew of Ferrari.


574
00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:42.380
Justin
Tree is also nominated for directing.


575
00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:52.460
Anatomy of a

576
00:33:58.020 --> 00:33:59.500
thank you.

577
00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:04.060
Oh, okay.

578
00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.020
Thank.

579
00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.140
Thank you so much.

580
00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:13.340
Well, uh,
it will help me through my midlife crisis.


581
00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.100
I think,

582
00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.980
uh, this is a crazy year.

583
00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.660
Um, anyway, this is great movie tonight.

584
00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:25.060
Contrast slightly. We've

585
00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:29.180
we've only wanted to start before

586
00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.700
we were stuck in
the house with two kids.

587
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:37.220
It was a lockdown, and we hook them up
to cartoons to have peace.


588
00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.540
And, uh, yeah, there is no line,

589
00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:43.500
I think, between work and diapers and.

590
00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.100
And then along came two other people,

591
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:49.780
a woman and a man, the Producers,
Marian's Luciani and everything.


592
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:52.860
And, uh, yeah,

593
00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:56.300
and they actually, that's
when things got a little crazy.


594
00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:01.180
It was like mixed doubles, ping pong,
played by neurotic French or something.


595
00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:06.180
And. But there was nothing between us
or above us,


596
00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:09.660
only total independence and freedom.

597
00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:11.180
And that's the only way
we could make that film.


598
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:15.580
So that's what

599
00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.060
I want to think of.

600
00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:19.020
The cast of Cassandra

601
00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:24.300
Swann Miller, one of the cast
for what you did on On said he was killed.


602
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.140
The script on set
and it's that's what we we


603
00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.460
that the best for
for writers for directors.


604
00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.580
Thank you so much.

605
00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:42.580
Thank you
It's it's such an honor. Thank you.


606
00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:50.580
Oh three.

607
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.460
It's you.

608
00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:56.580

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:08.900
I haven't seen any, really.

I'm a plastic surgeon.

615
00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:11.100
If I'm looking at a corpse.

624

Sherwin Algebra is like sheet music.

625
00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:44.140
The important thing isn't
Can you read music?


626
00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:45.620

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:08.860
tie herself into knots
so that people will like us


635
00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:09.580
more things.

636
00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:14.420
Screenplay by Tony McNamara
Based on the novel by Alastair Grant.


637
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.220
It is your Body.

638
00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.940
Bennett Baxter used to give freedom

639
00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.860
generally charged 30 francs.

640
00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:27.220
Well, that seems low.

641
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:36.140
And the Oscar goes to American fiction for

642
00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.780
this is the first Oscar win

643
00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:42.500
and second nomination this year
for Cord Jefferson, who was also nominated


644
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:52.500
as part of the producing team
of American fiction.


645
00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:18.980
And my God,

646
00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:21.460
look at this is Thank you much.

647
00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:25.100
Thank you so much.

648
00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.780
It's really this means the world to me.

649
00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.060
Thank you so much to the academy.

650
00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.620
Thank you so much to everybody
who worked on the film.


651
00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:34.700
Yeah, I've been talking a lot
about how many people passed on this movie


652
00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:38.380
and discussing it, and I worry that
that sometimes sounds vindictive


653
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:41.340
and I don't want to be vindictive.
I'm not a vindictive person anymore.


654
00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:46.060
I've worked very hard to not be
vindictive anymore and it's more a plea.


655
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.300
It's a plea to acknowledge
and recognize that there are


656
00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:53.060
so many people out there
who want the opportunity that I was given.


657
00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.380
And this is a I understand that

658
00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:59.380
this I only got 6 seconds, please.

659
00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:02.060
I understand that this is a risk averse
industry.


660
00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:03.220
I get it.

661
00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.700
But $200 million movies are also a risk,
you know, and


662
00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:09.820
and it doesn't always work out,
but you take the risk anyway.


663
00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:14.340
And instead of making one $200 million
movie, try making $2,010 million movies


664
00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:19.620
or or 5050, right.

665
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:25.180
$54 million movies like you can,
there are so many people.


666
00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:26.740
I just feel so much joy being here.

667
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.700
I mean, I felt so much joy
making this movie


668
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.660
and I want other people to experience
that joy and they are out there.


669
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.820
I promise you,
the next Martin Scorsese is out there.


670
00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.500
The next great, great is out there.

671
00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.180
Both Great is the next,
the next Christopher Nolan's out there.


672
00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.100
I promise you.

673
00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.500
They just want a shot
and we can give them one.


674
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.060
And this has changed my life.

675
00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.540
Thank all. Who worked on this movie for.

676
00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.700
For trusting a 40 year old black guy.

677
00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.620
He'd never directed anything before.

678
00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:59.620
It has changed my life. Thank you, sir.
I love you all. Thank you so much.


679
00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:09.820
Well, performing

680
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:13.500
the Oscar nominated song,
What Was I Made For From Barbie?


681
00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:23.580
Here are Billie Eilish, Finneas O'Connell.

682
00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:37.500
I love

683
00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.900
just the

684
00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:42.900
I know,

685
00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:45.900
but I'm not sure now.

686
00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:52.100
Oh, it was made for

687
00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:59.300
what I made for

688
00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:03.500
girls like

689
00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:06.060
I said.

690
00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:11.060
Oh, oh,

691
00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:13.980
but I.

692
00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:23.700
I, I don't know.

693
00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:33.780
It's something

694
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:50.540
the hundred

695
00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:59.420
00000, my boy.

696
00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:06.220
This is made for

697
00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:07.180
reason.

698
00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:14.060
My 400.

699
00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:20.220
The cousin.

700
00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:24.980
Oh oh.

701
00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:31.420
Well, I'll try.

702
00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:36.980
Oh, oh

703
00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:37.740
What?

704
00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:43.820
Some day. Oh,

705
00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:51.980
so I think I forgot

706
00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:57.980
how to be something

707
00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:04.340
But I can be something I always for.

708
00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:14.420
Oh, something only

709
00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:19.660
something I made

710
00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:29.660
for 001.

711
00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:59.020
I'm David Alan Grier
and I'm the announcer tonight.


712
00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.780
Here's what's coming up next.

713
00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:04.340
Catherine O'Hara and Michael Keaton.

714
00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:08.860
And then later, Marion,

715
00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:13.940
we find out who wins
for best supporting actor.


716
00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.300
Oh, yes,

717
00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:26.380
He's done that over tons.

718
00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:29.620
What a good story.

719
00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:33.500
This is childhood sweethearts
who reconnect 20 years later,


720
00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.380
only to realize
they were meant for each other.


721
00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:40.180
If two strangers
walk by each other in the street


722
00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:45.260
and their clothes accidentally brush, it's
because there have been 8000


723
00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:55.260
layers of union between them.

724
00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.340
Here are Catherine O'Hara

725
00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:07.340
and Oscar nominee Michael Keaton.

726
00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:13.900
We actors

727
00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:18.220
can't imagine a world without makeup
and hairstyling and production design.


728
00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.540
Oh, no, no, no.

729
00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:23.220
The last thing we want
is anyone knowing what we really look like


730
00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.660
or the squalor in which we actually live.

731
00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:29.340
You know, almost every job
and an immediate


732
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:32.500
intimacy with the good people
in the makeup and hair trailer.


733
00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:35.580
You meet them and discuss the character's
look, and before you know it,


734
00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.900
they're plucking your nose hairs

735
00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:42.260
or rubbing foundation into your cleavage
or spackling those 11 holes in your skull


736
00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:45.540
from result of that teenage
mishap of the nail gun.


737
00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:50.820
Oh, if I had a nickel, 
I could go on.

738
00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.420
Here are the nominees for

739
00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:57.260

Ana Lopez FOUKARA,

750
00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:26.820
David Martin and Monterey Rebate.

751
00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:30.300
Hey, the Oscar Goes to

752
00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:32.420
Poor Things.

753
00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:40.260
Maddie, Stacy, 
Michael and Josh Weston.

754
00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:44.100
This is the first Oscar and nomination
for Josh Weston,


755
00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:47.500
the first win
and second nomination for Nadia Stacy,


756
00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:57.580
the third Oscar win
and fifth nomination for Mark who


757
00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:05.740
ended up coming.

758
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:07.500
Oh, my gosh.

759
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.420
Thank you to the Academy.

760
00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:11.820
I can't believe I just said those words.

761
00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:16.540
Thank you to your girls for films
like nobody else.


762
00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.300
Thank you to Searchlight.

763
00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.460
Thank you to my crew.

765
00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.820
and Carolyn at home.

766
00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.220
Thank you to Blanca for everything.

767
00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:32.020
Thank you to.

768
00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.180
I know you're not meant to say my agent,
but she's amazing.


769
00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.740
Sylvia, say thank you.

770
00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.140
I'm a month

771
00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:40.780
big thank you to William. So

772
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:44.220

Such a pleasure


773
00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:46.420
for myself and Bobby

774

Bring it home.

777
00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.140
I don't have a publicist, but

778
00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:58.140
I'd love to thank all
my crew in the U.K..

779
00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.060
Isabel, where are you?

780
00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:03.060
Yay! My daughter, Isabel.

781
00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:04.940
My son

782
00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:05.380
and my son.

783
00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:15.380
Going back to the academy?

784
00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:16.900
Yes. Still here?

785
00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:17.820
Yeah.

786
00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:22.100
Looks like we're going to call back.

Whoa, this is crazy.

804
00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:44.340
I feel in the mood for love and Custard
tarts, weirdly.


805
00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:47.220

But we thank you all guys, all Emily.

823
00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:36.020
But we're off now.

824
00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:46.020
Thanks you guys.

825
00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:50.940
Tonight

826
00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:55.300
is the 50th anniversary
of what used to be the craziest moment


827
00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:58.860
in Oscar history
at the 46th Academy Awards.


828
00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:02.660
1974 David
Niven was in the middle of introducing


829
00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:11.180
Elizabeth Taylor when a nude man,
a streaker, ran across the straight stage.


830
00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:12.700
Can you imagine if a nude

831
00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:16.660
man ran across the stage today?

832
00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.260
I said, Can you imagine

833
00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:25.140
if a nude man
ran across the stage today?

834
00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:31.460
Wouldn't that be crazy?

835
00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:33.580
But I can't come there.

836
00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:35.620
I'll do the thing.

837
00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:37.780
Excuse me for a second.

838
00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:38.620
What's going on?

839
00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:41.100
You're supposed to run across the stage.

840
00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:42.660
I changed my mind.

841
00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:44.420
I don't want to do this tricky business.

842
00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:46.540
You mean
you don't want to do the streaker?


843
00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:47.900
But anymore we're doing it.

844
00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:50.100
Just don't feel right about it.

845
00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:51.540
It's no good event.

846
00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:55.460
You know, I'm so used to feel shame right
now for suggesting such a tasteless idea.


847
00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:57.940
Oh, supposed to be funny.

848
00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.380
The male body is not a joke.

849
00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:01.420
Mine is.

850
00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:04.060
No, it's not.

851
00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:05.940
You wrestle naked? Why not?

852
00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:09.380
You know I don't wrestle
naked. I wrestle Jorts


853
00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:12.820
Jorts are worse than naked.

854
00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:15.700
Come on.

855
00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:17.380
You're really not going to do this?

856
00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:27.380
If I just give out the award,
then got a worst


857
00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:54.740
costumes.

858
00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:57.820
They are so important.

859
00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:02.100
Maybe the most important thing there is.

860
00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:07.700
I can't open the envelope without the.

861
00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:12.260

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:26.020
Thank you, Academy.

879
00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:29.020
Thank you to, um.

880
00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:31.940
Sorry. This again. 
My fellow nominees.

881
00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:37.220
It's an amazing privilege
to be in the same room as you all.


882
00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:38.100
You all the people who

883
00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:41.980
inspired me to be a costume designer
in the first place, and I wasn't


884
00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:47.380
poor things was a very rare opportunity
to be really free


885
00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:50.900
and artistic in a creative process
as a costume designer.


886
00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:54.380
Thank you, Yorgos, for that opportunity

887
00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:58.980
and for making such bold and brave
and idiosyncratic work that you are.


888
00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:00.820
Thank you to the cast.

889
00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:03.300
You were such a joy to work with.

890
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.100
You all took every
every idea I threw at

891
00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:09.100
you and just ran with it
and embraced it with such humor.


892
00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:12.020
Thank you to Emma Stone
for giving us Bella Baxter


893

894
00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:19.380
Thank you to my amazing costume team.

895
00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:20.740
We all met in Budapest.

896
00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:22.540
We'd never worked together before.

897
00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:25.380
We have many Hungarians, a few Brits.

898
00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:26.500
It was Mid
-Pandemic.

899
00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:29.460
We had masks, we had translators.

900
00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:33.380
It's very hard to describe the brief
to everybody, and somehow


901
00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:35.980
we all managed to make it work somehow.

902
00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:39.140
Thank you to Tony McNamara for

903
00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:40.540
always supporting my work.

904
00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:42.020

905
00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:42.420

who have always supported me.


908
00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:50.980
I've got to go.

909
00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:54.420
And Andrew, who's over there, who looks
after the children so that I can work.


910
00:55:54.460 --> 00:56:04.460
Thank you so much.

911
00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:07.700

913
00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:14.500
It's the Oscars
live from the Dolby Theater


914
00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:23.140
at Ovation Hollywood.

915
00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:25.900
Oh, Sage

916
00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:28.900
had oil on
when in this Money star comment.


917
00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:31.740
But we should have known it
came with something else.


918
00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:35.100
Most films out here

919
00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:36.700
and some do things right.

920
00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:38.740
Most men

921
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:41.660
haven't done nothing wrong in this world.

922
00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:51.660
Have you told all the truths

923
00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:09.980
about

924
00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:34.300
what?

925
00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:26.940
Oh, no, no.

926
00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:12.620
Please
welcome Dwayne Johnson and Bad Bunny.


927
00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:16.140
And after that scene is rolling.

928
00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:21.060
Well, when you get to San Carlos, Ellen's
kind of spooning Hooters.


929
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.300
Beautifully said.

930
00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:25.540
You see, he's not such a bad bunny.

931
00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:27.580
Happy birthday, brother Garcia.

932
00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:28.420
Thank you.

933
00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:31.300
International films enrich

01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:11.340
State Museum for their trust and guidance
to my producers, actors, collaborators.


958
01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:14.660
All our choices were made to reflect
and confront us in the present.


959
01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:18.900
Not to say, Look what they did
then, rather look what we do now.


960
01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:22.500
Our film shows
where dehumanization leads at its worst.


961
01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:25.780
It shaped all of our past and present.

962
01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:28.540
Right now we stand here as men
who refute their Jewishness


963
01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:32.380
in the Holocaust, being hijacked
by an occupation which has led to conflict


964
01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:35.300
for so many innocent people,
whether the victims


965
01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:41.940
of October, the four,

966
01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:46.940
whether the victims of October the seventh
in Israel or the ongoing attack on Gaza,


967
01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:56.940
all the victims of this humanization,
how do we resist?


968
01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:00.860
Alexandra Bistro and Carlotta Check.

969
01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:03.300
The girl who plays in the film as she did
in life, chose


970
01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:06.340
to dedicate this to her memory
and her resistance.


971
01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:16.100
Thank you.

972
01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:18.980
Please welcome to tonight's Oscar nominees

973
01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:28.980
Emily Blunt and Ryan Gosling.

974
01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:33.500
Oh, hello, Emily. Wow.

975
01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.020
It is a frosty hello.

976
01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:37.020
And not at all.

977
01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:42.580
No, I'm just happy that we can finally put
this Barb and Hammer rivalry behind us.


978
01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:44.020
That's right.

979
01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:44.580
That's right.

980
01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:48.100
Is Ken and Kitty
just leaving all that fodder?


981
01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:50.740
The dust, skies, rain

982
01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:51.100
and the

983
01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:54.140
way this awards season's turned out
wasn't that much of a rivalry.


984
01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:59.540
So just let it go.

985
01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:04.340
So it's true.

986
01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:06.780
You guys are doing very well, you know.

987
01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:07.460
Congratulations.

988
01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:10.460
Thank you.

989
01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.540
But, you know,
I think I kind of figured out


990
01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:15.340
why they call it Barb and Hammer,
and they didn't call it up.


991
01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.300
And Barbie y.

992
01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:19.980
Well, I think you guys are at the tail
end of that because you are right


993
01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:29.300
in Barbie's coattails all summer.

994
01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:31.140
Thanks for Ken splaining.

995
01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:34.740
That to me.

996
01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:35.620
All right, Mr..

997
01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:37.980
I need to paint my abs on
to get nominated.


998
01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:40.740
You don't see Robert, don't you? Kidding?

999
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:41.380
You kidding?

1000
01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:43.460
Did not paint is This is insane.

1001
01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:44.700
Emily, this has got to stop.

1002
01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:48.900
We have to squash this.

1003
01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:51.940
We're here to celebrate the stunt
community massively. Yes.


1004
01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:55.900
They've been such a crucial part of our
industry since the beginning of cinema.


1005
01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:57.020
It's true.

1006
01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:03.180
They are truly the unsung heroes
who risk life and limb for cinema.


1007
01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:05.100
Playback

1008
01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:13.860
three So what action?

1009
01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:17.540
Chaplin Lloyd Keaton.

1010
01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:20.060
Cinema's
first directors were all stunt men


1011
01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:25.100
in their own right, and action
was the lifeblood of their story.


1012
01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:27.780
The Academy's history runs
deep with the incredible


1013
01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:37.780
work of the fearless artisans
of the stunt community,


1014
01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:41.260
and every award season features their work

1015
01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:45.140
in every genre,

1016
01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:46.900
from Butch and Sundance

1017
01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:50.540
to Black Panther, from the depths of space

1018
01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:54.300
to the battlefields of Earth and beyond.

1019
01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:57.940
Stunt performers and the action
they designed continue to create


1020
01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:03.860
some of the most memorable moments
in the history of cinema.


1021
01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:13.940
And they've been doing it from the start

1022
01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:23.980
and John

1023
01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:26.700
to the stunt performers
and the stunt coordinators


1024
01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:36.700
who help make movies Magic, we salute you.

1025
01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:43.100
Coming up, the award for supporting actor.

1026
01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:52.060
And then later, a reunion
you won't want to miss.


1027
01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:53.740
I thought I might stay over tonight.

1028
01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:55.820
To do what?

1029
01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:57.860
I'm actually sure.

1030
01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:00.380
Oh, it's girls night.

1031
01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:01.580
Hi, Barney.

1032
01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:02.940
Hi, Ken.

1033
01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:05.020
Watch me,

1034
01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.420
Barbie.

1035
01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:08.860
Hi. I'm weird Barbie.

1036
01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:09.900
I in the splits.

1037
01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:12.260
I have a funky haircut,
and I smell like basement.


1038
01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:16.740
Oh, I want to be part of the people
that makes meaning,


1039
01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:25.220
Not the thing that's made today.

1040
01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.860
Hi, everybody.

1041
01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:28.460
You guys all right? 
You're hanging in.

1042
01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:30.580
Everybody okay?

1043
01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:35.100
Apparently, a lot of people watching
at home are just just turning it on.


1044
01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:39.140
And they're upset because they thought the
show started at 5:00, like usually does.


1045
01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:41.980
So, anyway the producers and I just talked
and we think


1046
01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:45.220
the best thing to do
is to start the show over again.


1047
01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:47.460
So let's take it from the top.

1048
01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.780
Everybody take it on one. 
No, we're not.

1049
01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:51.780
You know, we're like an hour
and a half into the show.


1050
01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:57.700
If this was an AMC theater, the movie
would just be starting right now.


1051
01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:00.980
Our next category is for actor,
a supporting role.


1052
01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:03.820
And we have a whole bunch of Oscar winners
to support it.


1053
01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:12.060
Please
welcome your best supporting actors.


1054
01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:14.380
And the Oscar goes to

1055
01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:19.220
Sam Rockwell, Tim Robbins, Craig
Franklin, Crystal Balls,


1056
01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:29.420
Mahershala Ali.

1057
01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:45.060
It is

1058
01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:48.060
an honor for us to
be here to pay tribute

1059
01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:52.740
to the nominees for actor
in a supporting role.


1060
01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:54.500
Sterling,

1061
01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:56.500
I know you always

1062
01:07:56.500 --> 01:08:00.460
has been a long journey
to get to this night.


1063
01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:02.180
I can relate.

1064
01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:04.820
And I'm so, so happy

1065
01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:09.260
that you're finally being recognized
by your peers, your performance


1066
01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:13.540
and American fiction
is extraordinary and transformative,


1067
01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:23.620
and I am in awe.

1068
01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:28.540
The magic you bring on screen,
it's outmatched


1069
01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:38.620
only that by the magic
of who you are as a person.


1070
01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:43.180
There are actors,

1071
01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:45.900
and then there are actors
who don't drop character


1072
01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:49.220
until the DVD commentary.

1073
01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:52.060
Talking about Robert Downey Jr

1074
01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:56.780
that do

1075
01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:58.820
Susan's husband,

1076
01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:01.380
the Iron Man, he can be everyman.

1077
01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:03.460
He always goes above and beyond.

1078
01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:07.340
30 years ago, and as Chaplin, he learned
how to play the violin left handed.


1079
01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.900
Who does that seriously? 
It's obnoxious.

1080
01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:13.380
And now in Oppenheimer,
he steals scenes from Albert


1081
01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:16.380
Einstein and the atomic bomb.

1082
01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:17.780
I love him.

1083
01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:19.700
You love him?

1084
01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:23.900
We couldn't be happier for his third Oscar
nom for his amazing portrayal


1085
01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:32.660
as Louis Strauss.

1086
01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:33.340
In the course

1087
01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:36.340
of his brilliant career, 
Robert De Niro

1088
01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:43.100
as Steve

1089
01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:44.900
has teamed with Martin Scorsese

1090
01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:48.580
to bring us a wide range
of uniquely complicated villains.


1091
01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:52.300
His latest performance
in Killers of the Flower Moon delivers


1092
01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:56.500
a different type of evil,
not of a mobster or a psychotic loner,


1093
01:09:56.580 --> 01:10:01.460
but of a business man
consumed by greed and his lust for power.


1094
01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:04.340
Mr. De Niro, in an Oscar winning

1095
01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:09.020
Oscar worthy performance gives us

1096
01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:14.580
should be ready,

1097
01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:15.180
gives us a

1098
01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:19.580
reminder of the heart of darkness
within our ancestral blood.


1099
01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:29.660
Congratulations to an legend.

1100
01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:33.100
It's not really new
that certain male behavior


1101
01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:39.260
looks like the inferiority complex
of a plastic doll in a cardboard box.


1102
01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:42.180
But something easy to ridicule.

1103
01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:45.020
So why, then, do we admire

1104
01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:48.780
Ryan Gosling's skin so much?

1105
01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:52.940
Because Ryan's portrayal of Ken
allows us to.


1106
01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:54.220
Yeah, I admit it.

1107
01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:56.660
To connect.

1108
01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.540
Not. Not because it's ridiculous,

1109
01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:03.260
but because is funny, intelligent,
hugely entertaining,


1110
01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:07.660
and ultimately poignant
and deserving of empathy


1111
01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:10.860
to experience all is exactly

1112
01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:20.860
what we go to the movies for.

1113
01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:31.460
Mark Ruffalo

1114
01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:32.100
Over three

1115
01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:36.100
decades, you've captivated us
with your versatility.


1116
01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:39.620
From drama to comedy to action.

1117
01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:42.340
You've defied categorization,

1118
01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:45.260
and we wouldn't have it any other way.

1119
01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:48.340
Your appetite for challenges is unmatched,

1120
01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:52.020
exemplified by your portrayal of Duncan
Wedderburn in Poor Things,


1121
01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:54.700
which has rightfully earned
you this nomination.


1122
01:11:54.700 --> 01:12:00.380
Well,

1123
01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:02.700
and beyond your talent, Mark,

1124
01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:05.140
you're simply a wonderful human being.

1125
01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:14.740
Thank you.

1126
01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:18.500
And the Oscar goes to

1127
01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:26.900
Robert Downey Jr.

1128
01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:29.780
This is the first Oscar win
for Robert Downey Jr.


1129
01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:39.780
And he scored a nomination.

1130
01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:48.580
Thank you.

1131
01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:51.580
Thank you.

1132
01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:52.260
Thanks, Sam.

1133
01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:53.540
Thanks, fellows. 
That's amazing.

1134
01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:58.100
You only flubbed one line.

1135
01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:02.860
I'd like to thank my terrible childhood

1136
01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:05.380
and the academy

1137
01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:08.100
in that order.

1138
01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.900
I'd like to thank my veterinarian.

1139
01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:13.420
I meant wife

1140
01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:17.460
Susan Downey over there.

1141
01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:21.100
She found me a snarling rescue pet.

1142
01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.020
And you love me back to life.

1143
01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:24.340
That's why I'm here.

1144
01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:29.060
Thank you.

1145
01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:30.300
Here's my little secret.

1146
01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.900
I needed this job
more than it needed me.

1147
01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:35.980
Chris knew it and made sure
that she surrounded me


1148
01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:41.140
with one of the great cast and crews
of all time, Emily Kelly and Matt Damon.


1149
01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:43.020
Blunt It was fantastic.

1150
01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:46.020
And I stand here before you a better man
because of it.


1151
01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:50.700
You know, what we do is meaningful,
and the stuff that we decide to make


1152
01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:52.060
is important.

1153
01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:56.140
So back to my publicist and my Philip

1154
01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:59.980
Raskin is here
and Andrew Dunlap, my den mother.


1155
01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.780
Joy Feeley, thank you very much.

1156
01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:06.140
I want to thank my stylist
in case no one else does.


1157
01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:08.180
Thanks, Erica.

1158
01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:09.740
Thank you very much.

1159
01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:13.580
And I'm just going to say this.

1160
01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:16.060
My entertainment lawyer, Tom

1161
01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:20.900
Hansen of 40 years, the half
of which he spent trying to get me insured


1162
01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:24.260
and bailing me out of the hoosegow.

1163
01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:26.860
Thanks, bro.

1164
01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:36.860
Avery in India, this one's for you.

1165
01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:50.860
Robert Downey
Jr just had a moment of a lifetime.


1166
01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:54.260
And you came to
the academy in Los Angeles

1167
01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:57.220
where you can give your own acceptance
speech.


1168
01:14:57.220 --> 01:15:00.780
Immerse yourself in Oscar's justice
and buy one of a kind


1169
01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:10.780
Oscar ornaments, both in-person or online.

1170
01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:14.460
I need you to be precise.

1171
01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:17.060
Tell me everything.

1172
01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:19.740
The report is inconclusive.

1173
01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:24.860
Now, that's why an investigation
for more suspicious deaths,


1174
01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:27.940
because you were the only person there.

1175
01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:30.780
And of course, you always waive that.

1176
01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:40.620
Stop, Stop. I did not kill him.

1177
01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:41.900
Please welcome

1178
01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.900
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Oscar nominee

1179
01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:54.940
Danny DeVito.

1180
01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:02.740
Nice to

1181
01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:07.580
hear that film being there for you,
everybody.


1182
01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:08.980
Yeah. Yeah.

1183
01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:11.140
Very nice.

1184
01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:15.380
Well, Arnold and I are presenting together

1185
01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:18.340
for a very obvious reason.

1186
01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.940
We both tried to kill Batman. Yes.

1187
01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:21.540
Yeah.

1188
01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:22.940
Where would I die?

1189
01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:26.140
As the penguin in Batman Returns.

1190
01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:26.980
And that was Mr.

1191
01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:30.180
Freeze in Batman and Robin.

1192
01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:32.540
How did Batman beat you?

1193
01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:38.820
Oh, he used my one weakness against me.

1194
01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:42.300
He love. Oh,

1195
01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:44.660
he threw me out a window.

1196
01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:46.020
Oh, really?

1197
01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:47.660
Yeah. He's really Batman.

1198
01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:48.580
That son of a bitch.

1199
01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:51.580
Where is. Yeah, me.

1200
01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:53.100
Hey, there he is.

1201
01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:55.580
He's right here.

1202
01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:56.820
He's right in the.

1203
01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:58.660
You have a lot of
nerve to show your face.

1204
01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:00.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1205
01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:05.780
Son of a bitch.
You are a real big breaker.


1206
01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:06.900
Oh, I

1207
01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:11.060
want to see you after the Governor's ball.

1208
01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:14.140
You better believe. How?

1209
01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:14.620
All right.

1210
01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:18.980
And here are the nominees for achievement
in visual effects.

and the Oscar goes to We go.

1229
01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:22.820
This is a

1230
01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:24.940
gazillion

1231
01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:30.740
I won and potassium

1232
01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:34.060
yeah when you go toe to toe.

1233
01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:38.620
Oh this is the first Oscar win
and nomination for the visual effects


1234
01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:48.620
team from Godzilla minus one guy

1235
01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:12.980
who was

1236
01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:22.780
already hurt

1237
01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:24.980
by television 40 years ago

1238
01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:27.860
after the shock of seeing Star Wars

1239
01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:30.860
and encounters of the kind

1240
01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:35.180
to were so far from Hollywood,

1241
01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:40.100
even the possibility
standing on this stage


1242
01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:43.020
seemed out of reach.

1243
01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:46.220
The moment we are nominated,

1244
01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:51.300
we fought felt like Rocky Balboa.

1245
01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:55.180
We're kinda into the dying thing,

1246
01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:59.380
as echoed by

1247
01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:03.380
other

1248
01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:05.740
guys, by our biggest driver,

1249
01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:09.380
which was already a miracle.

1250
01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:15.140
But shall we stand

1251
01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:16.700
to see

1252
01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:20.740
all the big artists
outside, outside of Hollywood?


1253
01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:25.940
How you do of this thing
And this I like is proof


1254
01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:31.820
that everyone has the chance

1255
01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:33.700
firing

1256
01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:36.820
on whether you own the health

1257
01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:39.940
of the cast and crew of goodwill
minus one.


1258
01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:44.140
I Want to tell you a bit.

1259
01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:45.580
Producer Sergey.

1260
01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:50.220
I went through what we lost too soon.

1261
01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:52.540
We did it. Thank you.

1262
01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:54.220
Thanks a lot.

1263
01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:57.620
That's

1264
01:20:57.700 --> 01:20:59.460
not going to stop.

1265
01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:08.900
How did I got to?

1266
01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:10.740
Yeah,

1267
01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:12.660
Yeah. Here you go.

1268
01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:16.300
Okay, well, the next category
are some very important people.


1269
01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:18.460
Yeah, I've very the film editors,

1270
01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:22.420
the architects of storytelling,
they gave every year.


1271
01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:24.580
They work with the director.

1272
01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:28.420
They fix all the screw ups, right? And

1273
01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:33.980
now here are the nominees
for achievement in film editing


1274
01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:36.100
Anatomy of a Fall.

1299
01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:02.740
complicated, beautiful films
and you're unflappable.

I was terrified

1303
01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:14.540
like I am right now when I first got hired
to work with you and you hired me.


1304
01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:18.140
And it felt like you took a huge risk on
me, but you never made me feel that way.


1305
01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:21.980
And you instilled so much confidence
in me.


1306
01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:24.940
And I looked forward
to going to work with you every day.

Oh, I thought I was a wise lad.

1319
01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:38.860
But when you're playing God, let

1320
01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:40.220
thought I was hot.

1321

And that's never going to change.

1326

My God. Dr.

incredible musicians,

1466
01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:53.260
Daryl,

1467
01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:55.620
thank you for making this film with me.

1468
01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:58.060
Thank you for helping me in this journey.

1469
01:34:58.060 --> 01:35:00.740
This is the first.

1470
01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:10.740
This is the first Oscar
in the Ukrainian history.


1471
01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:14.300
And I'm honored.

1472
01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:16.540
I'm honored.

1473
01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:19.180
But probably I will be the first director
on this stage


1474
01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:23.060
who will say, I wish I would never

1475
01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:25.180
made this film.

1476
01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:28.140
I wish

1477
01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:32.900
to be able to exchange this to

1478
01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:33.620
Russia.

1479
01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:41.180
Never attacking Ukraine,
never occupying of cities.


1480
01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:42.980
Dear,

1481
01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:45.980
I wish to give it all the recognition

1482
01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:48.180
to Russia, not killing tens

1483
01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:51.700
of thousands of my fellow Ukrainians.

1484
01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:56.060
I wish for them to release
all the hostages,


1485
01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:59.020
all the

1486
01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:01.180
soldiers who are protecting their lands,

1487
01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:05.140
all the civilians
who are now in their jails.


1488
01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:09.380
But I cannot change the history.

1489
01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:13.820
I cannot change the past.

1490
01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:16.580
But we old together you.

1491
01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:22.460
I am among you some of the most talented
people in the world.


1492
01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:27.140
We can make sure that the history record
is set straight


1493
01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:33.980
and the truth will prevail.

1494
01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:36.940
And that the people of Mariupol

1495
01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:42.300
and those who given their lives
will never be forgotten.


1496
01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:45.460
Because cinema forms memories

1497
01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:49.340
and memories form history.

1498
01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:52.700
So thank you all and thank you all.

1499
01:36:52.780 --> 01:37:02.780

1506
01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:35.740
They take a vision and translate it
into the language of film.


1507
01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:40.020
The language they speak is esthetic,
but the stories they tell are visceral.


1508
01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:43.100
Cinematographers
direct our gaze where the story demands


1509
01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:44.940
and our imaginations pursue.

1510
01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:47.660
Where their visual road map leads us.

1511

1526
01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:57.940
Oh, silly.

1527
01:39:58.020 --> 01:39:58.660
To all this

1528
01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:03.100
aspiring filmmakers out there,
I would like to say, please try shooting


1529
01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:11.140
that incredible
new hip thing called celluloid.


1530
01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:14.300
It's much easier than you think

1531
01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:17.540
and it makes things look so much better.

1532
01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:18.900
Thank you to the Academy.

1533

Thank you. Emma Thomas.

1537
01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:31.060
You're by far the best thing
that could have happened to my career.


1538
01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:33.220
Obviously,

1539
01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:36.820
this wouldn't have existed without you.

1540
01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:38.500
Thank you, Universal.

1541

Please welcome Ramy Youssef and Issa Rae.

1546
01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:12.900
There's genius in the way.

1547
01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:16.900
Short films strip down stories
to their most fundamental elements,


1548
01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:19.380
which is exactly what we're going to do
with this presenter Copy.


1549
01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:20.020

West could not be here tonight.

1567
01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:09.220
We accept the award on his behalf.

1568
01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:10.580

they think they could stop you.

01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:06.460
There's no stopping you.

1581
01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:10.740
They can put out

01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:36.940
who wins the Oscar for best actor.

1598
01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:39.940
Mark, your books are good,
but they're not popular.


1599
01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:41.340
They won a black book.

1600
01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:42.580
Yo, Sarandon.

1601
01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:45.460
Girl, you'd be pregnant again.

1602
01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:47.620
I just want to
rub their noses in it.

1603
01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:48.740
Actually read one of your books.

1604
01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:50.860
So you are the one

1605
01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:51.460
we believe.

1606
01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:53.260
Mr. Lee has written a bestseller.

1607
01:44:53.260 --> 01:44:53.940
It's a joke.

1608
01:44:53.940 --> 01:44:55.980
The most lucrative joke you've ever told.

1609
01:44:55.980 --> 01:44:59.900
It is very black. Yes.

1610
01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:09.980
I'm happy you said
it and not me. You.

1611
01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:12.820
I strategically switched jackets

1612
01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:17.020
to make it impossible
for them to edit me out of the show.


1613
01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:20.620
Congratulations
to Wes Anderson, his first Oscar.


1614
01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:24.100
I feel like I should mention the reason
why he couldn't be here tonight.


1615
01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:27.660
He's at home
building a diorama made of corduroy. So?


1616
01:45:27.660 --> 01:45:29.580
But we wish him the best.

1617
01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:32.620
Our next presenter is not a legendary
movie star,


1618
01:45:32.820 --> 01:45:37.180
but he does talk like he should be
scolding Rita Hayworth for her insolence.


1619
01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:38.260
You'll see what I mean.

1620
01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:40.180
Here to present the Oscar for best Sound.

1621
01:45:40.180 --> 01:45:42.260
What are the funniest and loudest people
I know?


1622
01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:51.780
Please welcome John Mulaney,

1623
01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:54.820
now the Oscar for Achievement in Sound.

1624
01:45:54.820 --> 01:46:00.060
You know, for years movies didn't
have sound and then they figured it out.


1625
01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:04.060
Some people say that the silent era
was the golden era of film.


1626
01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:07.460
These people are difficult and insane.

1627
01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:10.660
Without sound, we wouldn't have been able
to hear such classic lines


1628
01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:12.220
as, You're going to need a bigger boat.

1629
01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:13.820
I'll have what she's having.

1630
01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:15.740
And he was in the Amazon with Mother

1631
01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:19.580
when she was researching spiders
just before she died.


1632
01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:22.060
Or what about that moment
in Field of Dreams


1633
01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:25.460
when we hear
if you build it, he will come.


1634
01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:27.900
And then Costner does it.
He builds a baseball field.


1635
01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:28.860
I guess he doesn't build that.

1636
01:46:28.860 --> 01:46:31.860
He mows down corn,
and then there is a field


1637
01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:34.180
and then he's like,
I'm going to watch, goes play baseball.


1638
01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:35.860
And the bank is like,
You want to pay your mortgage?


1639
01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:37.900
And he's like, No,
I'm going to watch guys play baseball.


1640
01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:41.540
And then he finds James Earl Jones,
who wrote The Boat Rocker, which I thought


1641
01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:45.740
was a real book deep into my twenties
and like, People Will Come.


1642
01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:48.100
Ray He's
the only one with a financial plan.


1643
01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:51.220
But what's weird is Timothy
Butterfield pushed his little Gaby Hoffman


1644
01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:54.300
off the bleachers
and she falls down and she's unconscious.


1645
01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:57.940
Then Burt Lancaster is Moonlight Graham,
and he comes up and he pats on the back


1646
01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:00.940
a couple of times and he's like,
hot dog stuck in the throat.


1647
01:47:01.180 --> 01:47:06.700
And then he can't go back in the game
because I there's a rule in ghost baseball


1648
01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:09.900
that if you leave the field at any point
to become an elderly ghost


1649
01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:13.940
and do the Heimlich maneuver,
you can't return to the field.


1650
01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:15.380
I love Field of Dreams.

1651
01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:18.900
That should win Best picture, though,
they'll probably go


1652
01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:21.860
with one of this year's.

1653
01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:24.700
Here are the nominees

1654
01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:34.700
for achievement in Sound.

1655
01:48:22.220 --> 01:48:26.380
And the Oscar goes
to the zone of interest.


1656
01:48:26.460 --> 01:48:33.460
Taryn Willard, Johnny Byrne,

1657
01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:43.380
and this is the first Oscar win
and nomination for Tom Willers


1658
01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:53.380
and Johnny Byrne

1659
01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:11.140
for wow, I'm

1660
01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:27.980
so amazing to be standing here and

1661
01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:29.580
and such an extraordinary

1662
01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:32.300
thank you to the Academy
for recognizing the art of sound in film.


1663
01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:34.540
Such an extraordinary year
for sound and film.


1664
01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:38.020
Well, you guys over there in sound, and
my mother wouldn't have understood this.


1665
01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:40.740
She she always said,
What do you mean you do this out in film?


1666
01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:45.100
They sound right to me which is sort of,
you know, But who do we need to thank?


1667
01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:46.260
Time to thank everybody.

1668
01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:49.100
We need to thank the Academy
for listening to our film.


1669
01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:50.780
Thank you Academy.

1670
01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:52.060
We do thank A24.

1671
01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:53.900
And when you say, Jonathan,
you taught me everything.


1672
01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:55.020
Thank you so much.

1673
01:49:55.020 --> 01:49:58.940
And to Oscar, Sophie and Kathy over there
and to everyone at Wave Studios


1674
01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:06.260
and everyone at A24, Jimmy of the Matter
Stash, Philip, Salima and Gretta Unanue.


1675
01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:07.780
Thank you.

1676
01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:08.220
Thank you.

1677
01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:10.740
Happy Mother's Day.

1678
01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:20.740
Mother's Day.

1679
01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:42.060
It doesn't seem to matter what I do.

1680
01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:42.940
Always.

1681
01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:45.820
Number two,

1682
01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:49.900
No one knows how hard I try.

1683
01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:52.700
Oh, I

1684
01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:54.740
have feelings.

1685
01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:56.860
I can't.

1686
01:50:56.860 --> 01:51:00.460
Driving me insane.

1687
01:51:00.540 --> 01:51:04.700
Oh, my life being so polite.

1688
01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:07.780
I'll alone tonight.

1689
01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:11.020
I'm just kidding. Anywhere.

1690
01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:15.260
I mean, it is in my destiny

1691
01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:21.380
to live and die in life
for choosing beauty


1692
01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:27.980
and just kidding when she sees a friend

1693
01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:31.780
for her to see the man behind the

1694
01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:41.780
take his fight for me.

1695
01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:53.820
I want to you to dinner

1696
01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:56.180
time in my life.

1697
01:51:56.180 --> 01:51:59.740
Where the hell

1698
01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:02.820
is my love

1699
01:52:02.980 --> 01:52:07.020
in my dreams

1700
01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:17.100
I'm no dreamer

1701
01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:27.500
And you saw my

1702
01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:40.260
I'm just too

1703
01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:43.620
well set to listen.

1704
01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:47.940
My decision to go

1705
01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:51.740
for the drug treatment.

1706
01:52:51.820 --> 01:52:54.700
I'm Just kidding will see.

1707
01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:57.700
She sees the first woman.

1708
01:52:57.780 --> 01:53:00.860
Take her to see

1709
01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:01.900
your heart.

1710
01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:05.420
Turn five.

1711
01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:09.420
I'm just gonna go

1712
01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:12.500
back.

1713
01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:16.180
So they should be out.

1714
01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:23.020
Just stay

1715
01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:24.620
that money.

1716
01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:27.340
Hey, my

1717
01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:29.620
world should be down.

1718
01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:34.860
I'm just

1719
01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:38.300
saying.

1720
01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:48.380
Check.

1721
01:54:05.340 --> 01:54:08.500
Just ahead, Cynthia
Erivo and Ariana Grande.


1722
01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:12.220
Days later, Steven Spielberg presents
the Oscar for directing,


1723
01:54:12.460 --> 01:54:22.460
followed by the awards
for Best Actor, Actress and Best Picture.


1724
01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:37.500
We. There's a chance

1725
01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:40.500
that when we push that button,

1726
01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:42.620
we destroy the world.

1727
01:54:42.620 --> 01:54:46.100
You know, the rules
don't apply to the Golden Boy.


1728
01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:50.940
Brilliance makes up for a lot.

1729
01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:53.140
The president needs to know what's next.

1730
01:54:53.140 --> 01:54:54.060
Next.

1731
01:54:54.060 --> 01:55:00.380
Maybe he thought fame
could actually protect in the world.


1732
01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:10.220
But remember this day.

1733
01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:14.900
Look what I got off Ryan Gosling's body

1734
01:55:14.980 --> 01:55:18.660
will start the bidding at $10,000.

1735
01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:23.380
Oh, Bradley Cooper's mother. Yes. You said

1736
01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:24.940
no. This is going home with me.

1737
01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:26.580
Sorry, ladies.

1738
01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:30.700
Here to present the Oscar for Outstanding
Original score and song, please welcome


1739
01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:33.820
Ariana Grande and two time Oscar nominee

1740
01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:43.820
Cynthia Erivo.

1741
01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:03.340
We're here

1742
01:56:03.340 --> 01:56:07.300
to present the Oscar for original song
and original score.


1743
01:56:07.380 --> 01:56:11.140
A great movie song can set the mood,
reveal something about a character


1744
01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:13.420
and help us tell a story.

1745
01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:18.020
And a great film score can even leave
a handprint on our hearts forever.


1746
01:56:18.100 --> 01:56:22.100
It can ignite wonder and astonishment
make us feel sadness and longing


1747
01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:25.580
and can even transport us to a new world
somewhere over the rainbow.


1748
01:56:25.580 --> 01:56:28.380
What the dreams that you dare to dream
really do come true.


1749
01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:30.220
Oh, how wickedly subtle of you.

1750
01:56:30.220 --> 01:56:32.980
I do try.

1751
01:56:32.980 --> 01:56:38.500
And now here are the
nominees for original score


1752

1766
01:57:49.980 --> 01:57:54.340
Is it for Nolan Thomas
for inviting me on this incredible world?


1767
01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:58.700
Christopher, is your idea
to use the violin in the score?


1768
01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:01.620
And it allowed me to work and collaborate

1769
01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:04.820
with a wonderful wife
and acclaimed violinist due in accordance.


1770
01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:08.380
And we

1771
01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:11.900
we had we recording a night
and we were rushing to go home


1772
01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:14.620
and put our kids, Paul
and Romeo, down to bed.


1773
01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:16.100
But the result of that was amazing.

1774
01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:22.060
And it really set a really nice tone
for the film of that performance.


1775
01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:24.700
Theresa Stanislav, Jake Brown,

Anthony Pather, Alissa Park, thank you
for making the music sound great.


1777
01:58:27.820 --> 01:58:29.340
And to my parents up there,

1778
01:58:29.340 --> 01:58:32.980
thank you for giving me guitars
and drum machines instead of video games.


1779
01:58:32.980 --> 01:58:42.980
Thank you.

1780
01:58:45.260 --> 01:58:45.900
All night

1781

you've seen performances of this year's

their first Oscar for the song
No Time to Die.


1788
01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:46.860
I had a nightmare about this last night.

1789
01:59:46.860 --> 01:59:53.900
I'm so

1790
01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:55.780
thank you so much to the academy.

1791
01:59:55.780 --> 01:59:58.620
I feel like I don't

1792
01:59:58.620 --> 02:00:00.140
I just didn't think this would happen.

1793
02:00:00.140 --> 02:00:02.500
I was not expecting this. I,

1794
02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:05.580
I feel so incredibly lucky and honored.

1795
02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:08.380
Thank you to Greta. 
Where did you go?

1796
02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:11.180
I love you. Thank you for this.

1797
02:00:11.180 --> 02:00:13.180
I'm so grateful for this song

1798
02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:17.740
and for this movie
and the way that it made me feel and


1799
02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:22.460
this goes out to everyone who was affected
by the movie and how incredible it is.


1800
02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:24.420
And I want to thank my team
and my parents.


1801
02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:26.220
I love you guys so much.
Thank you, Paul Walker.


1802
02:00:26.220 --> 02:00:27.300
Thank you. Even on crates.

1803
02:00:27.300 --> 02:00:30.180
Thank you, Mark and Andrew,
for making the song with us.


1804
02:00:30.180 --> 02:00:33.220
Thank you to everybody.

1805
02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:36.740
Yes, Margot, of course, Lucky chap. Tom.

1806
02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:38.260
Thank you to our parents.

1807
02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:40.740
Forever and ever and ever.

1808
02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:43.780
Thank you to my best friends,
David and Rach, for listening on my music.


1809

Thank you to Claudia for listening
all my best friend Zoe, for playing


1810
02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:51.300
with me
growing up and being by my side forever.


1811
02:00:51.380 --> 02:00:53.740
I want to thank my, like, dance
teachers growing up.


1812
02:00:53.740 --> 02:00:55.500
I want to thank my choir teachers.

1813
02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:57.580
Miss Brigham, thanks for believing in me.

1814
02:00:57.580 --> 02:01:00.980
Missy, you didn't like me,
but you were good at your job.


1815
02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:03.500
And thank you to the academy.

1816
02:01:03.500 --> 02:01:04.340
Thank you. Joe Marinelli.

1817
02:01:04.340 --> 02:01:10.380
I love you.

1818
02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:16.060
The past.

1819
02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:19.300
Jan, Mel Brooks, Carol, Little Kim

1820
02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:23.300
and Angela Bassett
each received an honorary Oscar,


1821
02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:27.580
and Michelle Satter received
the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award


1822
02:01:27.740 --> 02:01:32.300
at our annual Governors Awards
to watch their inspiring speeches.


1823
02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:37.540
This ceremony
scan the QR code on your screen.


1824
02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:38.620
Oh, Billy.

1825
02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:41.620
Oh, my God.

1826
02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:44.900
Oh, Coming up

1827
02:01:44.900 --> 02:01:47.900
next on the Oscars,
the biggest awards of the night.


1828
02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:58.020
Actor, actress and best picture

1829
02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:00.780
achieved movie stars.

1830
02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:03.980
I mean,
they nearly just died a year later.


1831
02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:06.820
Praise the Lord.
It was my chance to be near.


1832
02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:09.220
But now we're in the ceiling.
Were my mentor.


1833
02:02:09.220 --> 02:02:14.660
I said you should live with your beat,
Source told News Letters to us


1834
02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:24.740
at least double deliberately

1835
02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:27.420
Do not predict content

1836
02:02:27.420 --> 02:02:29.980
predictability

1837
02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:32.060
and above all, all those

1838
02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:40.100
who would have loved

1839
02:02:40.180 --> 02:02:41.860
a real loser is somebody that's

1840
02:02:41.860 --> 02:02:51.860
so afraid of not winning,
they don't even try.


1841
02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:55.260
There's only one perfect you.

1842
02:02:55.260 --> 02:03:04.220
And that's the view of the sky
over our heads.


1843
02:03:04.300 --> 02:03:04.900
All we asked

1844
02:03:04.900 --> 02:03:08.060
for was a chance to prove ourselves
a fair and impartial


1845
02:03:08.060 --> 02:03:12.380
opportunity.

1846
02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:15.580
It's what you do to the people
you say you love.


1847
02:03:15.620 --> 02:03:22.340
That's what matters.

1848
02:03:22.420 --> 02:03:24.860
I don't have to see it, Daddy.

1849
02:03:24.860 --> 02:03:30.660
I lived in

1850
02:03:30.740 --> 02:03:31.780
love.

1851
02:03:31.780 --> 02:03:41.780
Love means never having to say
you saw one.


1852
02:03:41.860 --> 02:03:43.340
Those don't turn us.

1853
02:03:43.340 --> 02:03:48.780
No, no reason to mourn
from the part on earth.


1854
02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:53.860
You'll see those silky circle men
coming to me alone.


1855
02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:54.820
Are you sick?

1856
02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:59.020
They come have me all sooner

1857
02:03:59.020 --> 02:04:08.420
to secure, commit, commit medical

1858
02:04:08.500 --> 02:04:09.820
time.

1859
02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:17.180
Oh, say good bye.

1860
02:04:17.260 --> 02:04:20.580
Hardly

1861
02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:24.900
at held on my word

1862
02:04:24.900 --> 02:04:29.420
Adore to be so content.

1863
02:04:29.500 --> 02:04:31.500
Oh, they're searching.

1864
02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:36.660
Is it all coming to an priority?

1865
02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:44.740
Oh, so no ever lying.

1866
02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:48.260
Hey. Oh, no,

1867
02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:53.020
not on us is 1020.

1868
02:04:53.100 --> 02:05:03.100
It's time to say good 5G.

1869
02:05:03.820 --> 02:05:07.620
Oh, I'm

1870
02:05:07.700 --> 02:05:11.900
so sorry, but I'm not

1871
02:05:11.980 --> 02:05:13.180
say oh,

1872
02:05:13.180 --> 02:05:20.460
0000000.

1873
02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:23.660
Hey, you're

1874
02:05:23.660 --> 02:05:33.660
dead. Oh,

1875
02:05:38.940 --> 02:05:41.020
but how the world works.

1876
02:05:41.020 --> 02:05:43.660
It's nobody had a chance to be somebody.

1877
02:05:43.660 --> 02:05:44.980
Yeah.

1878
02:05:44.980 --> 02:05:54.980
Oh, oh,

1879
02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:24.700
we're back at the Oscars.

1880
02:06:24.700 --> 02:06:25.860
Well, some of us are back.

1881
02:06:25.860 --> 02:06:28.900
Some of the others are getting up
and hammered at the bar in the lobby.


1882
02:06:28.900 --> 02:06:33.580
But we've only got four awards left,
which shouldn't take long.


1883
02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:37.100
And you had it will.

1884
02:06:37.180 --> 02:06:38.980
But first,
it's time to find out who will be named


1885
02:06:38.980 --> 02:06:42.220
best actor and what a lineup
we've assembled to present here


1886
02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:43.940
with the Oscar for Best Actor.

1887
02:06:43.940 --> 02:06:53.940
Please welcome
all five original members of NSYNC.


1888
02:06:57.020 --> 02:06:57.900
The Oscar goes

1889
02:06:57.900 --> 02:07:02.300
to Nicolas Cage, Matthew McConaughey,
Brendan Fraser,


1890
02:07:02.380 --> 02:07:12.380
Ben Kingsley, Forest Whitaker.

1891
02:07:24.780 --> 02:07:26.780
We're here
to speak about the great talent of this


1892
02:07:26.780 --> 02:07:31.100
year's
five nominees for actor in a leading role.


1893
02:07:31.180 --> 02:07:38.300
When you see Jeffrey Wright in a film,

1894
02:07:38.380 --> 02:07:39.380
you instantly know

1895
02:07:39.380 --> 02:07:42.860
it's going to be good
because he's so good.


1896
02:07:42.940 --> 02:07:45.460
Jeffrey in fiction,

1897
02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:50.340
you are funny and furious
and flawed and empathetic,


1898
02:07:50.420 --> 02:08:00.420
and for the way that you elevate
the craft, we're indebted to you.


1899
02:08:00.980 --> 02:08:01.740
The greats go

1900
02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:04.740
above and beyond in their commitment
to a role.


1901
02:08:04.820 --> 02:08:08.540
Just as Daniel
Day-Lewis stayed in character as Lincoln


1902
02:08:08.620 --> 02:08:14.220
this past year, Paul was so committed
for the character to have a lazy eye.


1903
02:08:14.460 --> 02:08:18.220
He wore a soft contact
lens during the entire shoot,


1904
02:08:18.300 --> 02:08:21.860
which made him blind
in that eye while filming.


1905
02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:23.020
Would I have done that?

1906
02:08:23.020 --> 02:08:23.820
Hell, yes.

1907
02:08:23.820 --> 02:08:27.620
But the point is,
you did do it, Paul.

1908
02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:30.260
You were brilliant, James.

1909

Nothing better describes you, sir.

02:08:45.060 --> 02:08:49.140

directed, produced
and acted in his latest film, Maestro.


1915
02:08:54.940 --> 02:08:57.580
From the script to the screen,

1916
02:08:57.580 --> 02:09:01.860
Bradley takes a transformative journey
into becoming Leonard Bernstein,


1917
02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:03.300
bringing to life all the character,

1918
02:09:03.300 --> 02:09:07.260
charisma and complex brilliance
of an American icon.

Congratulations.

1920
02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:24.980
Killian Murphy.

1921
02:09:25.060 --> 02:09:28.300
He accepted the leading
role of Oppenheimer


1922
02:09:28.380 --> 02:09:30.980
before even reading the script,

1923
02:09:30.980 --> 02:09:35.820
which must have taken much courage
and trust


1924
02:09:35.900 --> 02:09:38.580
or symbol Hotspur.

1925
02:09:38.580 --> 02:09:40.420
Either way,

1926
02:09:40.420 --> 02:09:43.420
the performance is masterful,

1927
02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:47.980
endowing his portrayal
with layers of humanity


1928
02:09:48.060 --> 02:09:52.940
whilst his character
created something inhuman.


1929
02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:55.420
It's riveting to watch.

1930
02:09:55.420 --> 02:10:04.900
My congratulations.

1931
02:10:04.980 --> 02:10:09.500
Coleman When I first worked with you

1932
02:10:09.580 --> 02:10:11.980
over a decade ago,

1933
02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:16.900
I saw that you were all brilliant,
bound for greatness.


1934
02:10:16.980 --> 02:10:19.980
It's been exciting to watch
you light up the screen over years,


1935
02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:22.140
most recently with your truly inspired

1936
02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:27.020
portrayal of civil rights leader
Bayard Rustin.


1937
02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:29.740
Coleman would genius as an actor
illuminates


1938
02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:35.420
the genius of an angelic troublemaker
very buried in the history books.


1939
02:10:35.500 --> 02:10:38.380
Thankfully, Justin is getting his due.

1940
02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:40.140

1941

1946

02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:53.540
Thank you to the Academy.

I love you so much

standing here tonight. So,

1964
02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:40.300
you know, we made a film.

1965
02:12:40.300 --> 02:12:43.660
We made a film about the man
who created the atomic bomb.


1966
02:12:43.740 --> 02:12:46.860
And for better or for worse,
we are all living in Oppenheimer's world,


1967
02:12:46.860 --> 02:12:50.700
so I would really like to dedicate this
to the peacemakers everywhere.

02:13:23.100 --> 02:13:24.740
At the very best

1974
02:13:24.740 --> 02:13:27.500
films can do more than entertain us.

1975
02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:30.340
They can open our hearts to each other.

1976
02:13:30.420 --> 02:13:30.700
They can

1977
02:13:30.700 --> 02:13:33.700
show us
ourselves and they can shine a light on


1978
02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:37.700
where we've been and make us
think about where we are going.


1979
02:13:37.780 --> 02:13:41.540
We are so fortunate that this has a great
and eclectic year

who have dragged me up here.

2004

02:15:32.780 --> 02:15:37.180
enough about the incredible crew

Thank you to Chuck Roven

journey is going from here.

2024
02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:33.500
Thank you very much.

02:16:45.340 --> 02:16:55.340
Here on ABC.

2028
02:16:57.580 --> 02:17:00.220
And the Oscar goes to Sally Field,

2029
02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:03.660
Jennifer Lawrence, Michelle Yeoh, Charlize

2030
02:17:03.740 --> 02:17:13.740
Jessica Lange.

2031
02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:39.580
It's an honor for us

2032
02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:43.620
to present the award
for actress in a leading role.


2033
02:17:43.700 --> 02:17:46.100
The amazing Sandra Color.

2034
02:17:46.100 --> 02:17:51.980
Is nominated for her role
in Anatomy of a Fall


2035
02:17:52.060 --> 02:17:55.700
as a woman accused of killing her husband.

2036
02:17:55.780 --> 02:17:59.780
At the heart of this powerful performance
is how Sandra


2037
02:17:59.860 --> 02:18:03.140
maintains a certain ambiguity throughout,

2038
02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:07.580
as if her character is capable
of committing that crime.


2039
02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:09.020
And here we are.

2040
02:18:09.020 --> 02:18:10.540
Oscar night.

2041
02:18:10.540 --> 02:18:20.540
And I still don't
know if she did it.

2042
02:18:24.060 --> 02:18:27.060
Curious as a puppy
and hungry as a bear,

2043
02:18:27.220 --> 02:18:31.340
Emma Stone's
brilliant Bella is unhinged and


2044
02:18:31.420 --> 02:18:35.580
and completely original
with the fearlessness of a toddler.


2045
02:18:35.580 --> 02:18:40.100
She awkwardly steps into the world,
awakening into her body.


2046
02:18:40.260 --> 02:18:43.740
And this sensation of being alive
without boundaries.


2047
02:18:43.820 --> 02:18:48.340
It is an unforgettable and endearing
character created by an actor


2048
02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:53.140
who is always surprising,
who to be categorized and like Bella,


2049
02:18:53.380 --> 02:19:03.380
is completely original out and.

2050
02:19:06.260 --> 02:19:07.100
Lily,

2051
02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:14.660
you are the soul of killers
of the flower moon.


2052
02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:18.620
Every second of your performance
as Molly Burkhart is imbued


2053
02:19:18.620 --> 02:19:23.100
with the plight, resilience
and spirit of the Osage.


2054
02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:26.660
Your advocacy offset is a powerful display
of dedication


2055
02:19:26.740 --> 02:19:30.100
and leadership, illuminating
and helping us reconcile


2056
02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:34.140
one of the darkest parts of our country's
history.


2057
02:19:34.220 --> 02:19:42.380
Congratulations,

2058
02:19:42.460 --> 02:19:50.060
Annette.

2059
02:19:50.100 --> 02:19:54.540
I've never been stung by a jellyfish,

2060
02:19:54.620 --> 02:19:55.540
but seeing you endure

2061
02:19:55.540 --> 02:19:59.180
it multiple times
made me feel like I have.


2062
02:19:59.260 --> 02:20:00.980
Watching you portray Diana,

2063
02:20:00.980 --> 02:20:04.740
Diana
Nyad is an intense sensory experience.


2064
02:20:04.980 --> 02:20:09.100
You can taste the salt water,
feel the sunburn,


2065
02:20:09.180 --> 02:20:12.900
and relate to the relentless determination

2066
02:20:12.980 --> 02:20:15.980
your work is a beautiful illustration

2067
02:20:16.020 --> 02:20:18.980
of how to navigate
the waves and the ocean

2068
02:20:18.980 --> 02:20:28.980
and in life

2069
02:20:31.820 --> 02:20:33.620
in Maestro

2070
02:20:33.620 --> 02:20:36.900
Carey Mulligan radiates
as Leonard Bernstein's


2071
02:20:36.900 --> 02:20:41.260
wife, Felicia,

2072
02:20:41.340 --> 02:20:45.860
the shining of piercing light

2073
02:20:45.860 --> 02:20:49.700
on their complicated, yet enduring love.

2074
02:20:49.780 --> 02:20:53.820
But this level of excellence
is the norm for Carey,


2075
02:20:53.900 --> 02:20:57.420
for an every role
she takes on, she infuses it


2076
02:20:57.500 --> 02:21:00.500
with a unique humanity.

2077
02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:03.100
Without this spectacular performance,

2078
02:21:03.100 --> 02:21:08.660
Maestro would not have been the movie
it became.


2079
02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:18.740
Carey You are so deserving of this honor

2080
02:21:24.340 --> 02:21:27.140
and the Oscar goes to

2081
02:21:27.220 --> 02:21:33.180
and whistle.

2082
02:21:33.260 --> 02:21:35.620
This is a

2083
02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:37.620
nomination for Emma Stone.

2084
02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:41.980
She took home the first Oscar for, her
leading performance in La la Land.


2085
02:21:42.060 --> 02:21:45.460
She is the second woman to be nominated
for acting and best picture


2086
02:21:45.460 --> 02:21:55.460
for the same.

2087
02:22:13.460 --> 02:22:15.260
Oh, boy.

2088
02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:18.100
My dress is broken.

2089
02:22:18.100 --> 02:22:19.180
I think it happened during.

2090
02:22:19.180 --> 02:22:22.180
I'm just can.

2091
02:22:22.180 --> 02:22:24.420
I'm pretty sure.

2092
02:22:24.420 --> 02:22:24.900
Oh, boy.

2093
02:22:24.900 --> 02:22:27.660
This is really
this is really overwhelming.


2094
02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:28.100
Sorry.

2095
02:22:28.100 --> 02:22:30.940
I am okay,
But my voice is also a little gone.


2096
02:22:30.940 --> 02:22:33.700
Whatever.

2097
02:22:33.700 --> 02:22:37.660
The women on the stage,
you are all incredible.


2098
02:22:37.660 --> 02:22:43.260
And the women in this category.

2099
02:22:43.340 --> 02:22:46.260
Sandra, Annette, Kerry.

2100
02:22:46.260 --> 02:22:49.100
Lily, I share this with you.

2101
02:22:49.100 --> 02:22:50.740
I in all of you.

2102
02:22:50.740 --> 02:22:54.100
And it has been such an honor
to do all of this together.


2103
02:22:54.100 --> 02:22:57.580
I hope we get
to keep doing more together.

2104
02:22:57.660 --> 02:22:58.500
I don't know what I'm saying.

2105
02:22:58.500 --> 02:23:02.060
Oh, my God. I'm totally okay.

2106
02:23:02.100 --> 02:23:04.020
The other night I was panicking,

2107
02:23:04.020 --> 02:23:08.180
as you can kind
of see, happens a lot

2108
02:23:08.260 --> 02:23:09.820
that maybe something like
this could happen.


2109
02:23:09.820 --> 02:23:14.540
And Yorgos said to me,
Please take yourself out of it.


2110
02:23:14.620 --> 02:23:18.140
And he was right,
because it's not about me.


2111
02:23:18.180 --> 02:23:20.500
It's about a team that came together

2112
02:23:20.500 --> 02:23:23.660
to make something greater
than the sum of its parts.


2113
02:23:23.740 --> 02:23:28.380
And that is the best part about making
movies


2114
02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:29.860
is all of us together.

2115
02:23:29.860 --> 02:23:35.660
And I am so deeply honored to share this
with every cast member,


2116
02:23:35.740 --> 02:23:40.100
with every crew member,
with single person who poured their love


2117
02:23:40.100 --> 02:23:43.700
and their care and their brilliance
into the making of this film.


2118
02:23:43.940 --> 02:23:48.020
And Yorgos, thank you for the gift
of a lifetime in Bella Baxter.


2119
02:23:48.100 --> 02:23:49.780
I am forever thankful for you.

2120
02:23:49.780 --> 02:23:53.140
Thank you for inviting all of us
to be members of this team.


2121
02:23:53.220 --> 02:23:56.380
Thank you.

2122
02:23:56.460 --> 02:23:58.020
I just wait.

2123
02:23:58.020 --> 02:24:02.300
I just.

2124
02:24:02.340 --> 02:24:04.420
I know I have to wrap up,
but I really just want to thank


2125
02:24:04.420 --> 02:24:08.380
my family, my mom, my brother, Spencer,
my dad, my husband, Dave.


2126
02:24:08.460 --> 02:24:09.740
I love you so much.

2127
02:24:09.740 --> 02:24:12.460
And Most importantly, my daughter,

2128
02:24:12.460 --> 02:24:17.180
who's going to be three in three days
and has turned our lives Technicolor.


2129
02:24:17.260 --> 02:24:19.900
I love you Bigger than the whole sky,
my girl.


2130
02:24:19.900 --> 02:24:21.940
So thank you so much.

2131
02:24:21.940 --> 02:24:23.980
Don't look at the back of my dress.

2132
02:24:23.980 --> 02:24:33.980
Thank you,

2133
02:24:41.220 --> 02:24:41.540
guys.

2134
02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:44.860
Make sure we tear up that envelope
so there's no confusion


2135
02:24:44.860 --> 02:24:51.300
with the best picture.

2136
02:24:51.380 --> 02:24:53.260
Hi, everyone.

2137
02:24:53.260 --> 02:24:57.700
I was just, you know, this this doing
this show is not about me.


2138
02:24:57.700 --> 02:25:02.180
And I appreciate you having me
is really about you and Emma


2139
02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:05.260
and all these great actors
and actresses and filmmakers.


2140
02:25:05.260 --> 02:25:10.140
But I was told we have like an extra
and I'm really proud of something.


2141
02:25:10.340 --> 02:25:13.100
I was wondering
if I could share it with you.


2142
02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:18.220
I just got a review and

2143
02:25:18.300 --> 02:25:18.700
has there

2144
02:25:18.700 --> 02:25:22.460
ever been a worse host
than Jimmy Kimmel at the Oscars?


2145
02:25:22.540 --> 02:25:25.180
His opening
was that of a less than average person


2146
02:25:25.180 --> 02:25:29.180
trying too hard to be something,
which he is not and never can be.


2147
02:25:29.260 --> 02:25:30.380
Get rid of Kimmel

2148
02:25:30.380 --> 02:25:34.260
and perhaps replace him with another
washed up a cheap ABC talent.


2149
02:25:34.500 --> 02:25:36.420
George Slop Annapolis.

2150
02:25:36.420 --> 02:25:40.780
He would make everybody on stage
look bigger, stronger and more glamorous.


2151
02:25:40.860 --> 02:25:42.060
Blah, blah, blah.

2152
02:25:42.060 --> 02:25:48.820
Make America great again.

2153
02:25:48.900 --> 02:25:50.140
Yeah.

2154
02:25:50.140 --> 02:25:50.500
Okay.

2155
02:25:50.500 --> 02:25:54.900
Now see if you can guess
which former president


2156
02:25:54.900 --> 02:25:57.900
just get down on treason.

2157
02:25:58.060 --> 02:26:00.380
Anyone? No.

2158
02:26:00.380 --> 02:26:01.020
I'll thank you.

2159
02:26:01.020 --> 02:26:03.220
President Trump.

2160
02:26:03.220 --> 02:26:04.180
Thank you for watching.

2161
02:26:04.180 --> 02:26:14.180
I'm surprised still, isn't
it past your jail time?


2162
02:26:21.660 --> 02:26:24.660
It's focused on the important stuff
for sure.


2163
02:26:24.900 --> 02:26:26.220
Before we give out the final award.

2164
02:26:26.220 --> 02:26:29.340
Did anyone not get a chance
to give a speech?


2165
02:26:29.340 --> 02:26:32.020
We do have some time.
You have anything you want to say?


2166
02:26:32.020 --> 02:26:33.020
Just line up right here.

2167
02:26:33.020 --> 02:26:36.860
We'll make sure everybody gets a chance
to talk to us in our final word


2168
02:26:36.860 --> 02:26:42.700
of the evening and to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of The Godfather Part two,


2169
02:26:42.780 --> 02:26:46.900
a man who created some of the most iconic
characters in movie history.


2170
02:26:46.900 --> 02:26:49.620
He's an Oscar winner
and a nine time nominee.


2171
02:26:49.620 --> 02:26:50.540
And we

2172
02:26:50.540 --> 02:26:54.620
so glad he was able to find a sitter
so he could be here tonight


2173
02:26:54.700 --> 02:26:56.140
with the award for Best Picture.

2174
02:26:56.140 --> 02:27:06.140
Please welcome Al Pacino.

2175
02:27:16.980 --> 02:27:22.500
I owe my friend.

2176
02:27:22.580 --> 02:27:24.820
Thank you. Say,

2177
02:27:24.820 --> 02:27:26.700
Oh, no, I did that.

2178
02:27:26.700 --> 02:27:31.980
I do some Shakespeare now,
I think is in order, right


2179
02:27:32.060 --> 02:27:34.340
to be.

2180
02:27:34.340 --> 02:27:35.300
No, I'm not going to do it.

2181
02:27:35.300 --> 02:27:36.580
Oh, no, no, no.

2182
02:27:36.580 --> 02:27:39.300
Sorry, world.

2183
02:27:39.300 --> 02:27:44.020
This is the time
for the last award of the evening,


2184
02:27:44.100 --> 02:27:49.500
and it's my honor to present

2185
02:27:49.580 --> 02:27:52.580
ten wonderful films

2186
02:27:52.660 --> 02:27:54.940
were nominated,

2187
02:27:54.940 --> 02:27:57.940
but only one will take the award

2188
02:27:57.940 --> 02:28:01.940
for best picture.

2189
02:28:02.020 --> 02:28:06.180
And I have to go
to the envelope for that,

2190
02:28:06.260 --> 02:28:09.460
and I will.

2191
02:28:09.540 --> 02:28:13.980
Here it comes.

2192
02:28:14.060 --> 02:28:18.620
And Maria, I see Oppenheimer.

2193
02:28:18.700 --> 02:28:20.980
Yes, Yes.

2194
02:28:20.980 --> 02:28:23.980
Evan Thomas. John,

2195
02:28:24.020 --> 02:28:29.980
what happened?

2196
02:28:30.060 --> 02:28:31.500
Oppenheimer has 13

2197
02:28:31.500 --> 02:28:35.940
nominations
and has won seven Oscars tonight for actor


2198
02:28:35.940 --> 02:28:40.460
in a supporting role
film, editing, cinematography,


2199
02:28:40.540 --> 02:28:50.540
original score actor in a leading role
directing and best picture.


2200
02:29:13.260 --> 02:29:17.220
Wow. Oh,

2201
02:29:17.220 --> 02:29:22.700
my goodness. Wow.

2202
02:29:22.780 --> 02:29:25.300
I think any of us

2203
02:29:25.300 --> 02:29:29.500
who make movies know
that you kind of dream of this moment.


2204
02:29:29.580 --> 02:29:31.420
You know you do, right?

2205
02:29:31.420 --> 02:29:36.260
I could deny it, but I have been dreaming
about this moment for so long,


2206
02:29:36.340 --> 02:29:39.580
but it seemed so unlikely
that it would ever actually happen.


2207
02:29:39.820 --> 02:29:42.820
And now I'm standing here
and everything's of gone out of my head.


2208
02:29:43.060 --> 02:29:47.220
And the the reason

2209
02:29:47.300 --> 02:29:50.780
this movie was the movie,
it was with Chris Nolan.


2210
02:29:50.860 --> 02:29:54.500
He is singular.

2211
02:29:54.580 --> 02:29:55.940
He is brilliant.

2212
02:29:55.940 --> 02:30:00.020
And I'm so grateful to you.

2213
02:30:00.100 --> 02:30:05.020
But as Emma said, this is the thing
that's fantastic about our jobs


2214
02:30:05.020 --> 02:30:07.260
is that it's about collaboration,
it's about teamwork.


2215
02:30:07.260 --> 02:30:10.540
And our team
was just incredible on this movie.


2216
02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:13.540
So thank you to all of them,
both cast and crew.


2217
02:30:13.660 --> 02:30:17.780
Thank you to Universal for supporting us.

2218
02:30:17.860 --> 02:30:20.740
And I want to thank

2219
02:30:20.820 --> 02:30:25.140
Rich Gelfond
at IMAX and everybody else IMAX


2220
02:30:25.220 --> 02:30:28.020
for believing in this movie
when that maybe


2221
02:30:28.020 --> 02:30:31.300
didn't make that much sense to do so

2222
02:30:31.380 --> 02:30:34.260
Thank you to all the theaters

2223
02:30:34.260 --> 02:30:37.740
as a moviegoer and as a filmmaker.

2224
02:30:37.820 --> 02:30:39.340
That's why why we do what we do.

2225
02:30:39.340 --> 02:30:40.540
So thank so much.

2226
02:30:40.540 --> 02:30:43.540
And to my children, Flora,

2227
02:30:43.580 --> 02:30:46.420
Rory,
Oliver and Magnus, who's not here tonight.


2228
02:30:46.420 --> 02:30:46.740
Thank you.

2229
02:30:46.740 --> 02:30:49.780
And it's UK Mother's Day,
so I'm thinking of my mum who no longer


2230
02:30:49.780 --> 02:30:54.260
with us today, and my mother in law,
Christina, who's here with my dad.


2231
02:30:54.260 --> 02:30:55.660
So thank you.

2232
02:30:55.660 --> 02:30:57.020
Oh, and thank you to the academy.

2233
02:30:57.020 --> 02:30:59.540
I'm so honored to be

2234
02:30:59.540 --> 02:31:08.780
here.

2235
02:31:08.860 --> 02:31:11.620
I certainly want to thank the Academy.

2236
02:31:11.620 --> 02:31:18.820
I want to thank Universal Pictures,
Donna Langley and the whole team there.


2237
02:31:18.900 --> 02:31:20.900
I, of course,

2238
02:31:20.900 --> 02:31:26.180
want to thank my
my family and my wife,

2239
02:31:26.260 --> 02:31:29.700
who always has my back and is,

2240
02:31:29.780 --> 02:31:33.740
as all my friends
know, the secret weapon of my life.


2241
02:31:33.820 --> 02:31:39.140
And I also want to thank James
and David Wargo for


2242
02:31:39.220 --> 02:31:42.780
trusting me to move this project forward.

2243
02:31:42.980 --> 02:31:45.980
They gave me the book,
which I was fortunate enough


2244
02:31:45.980 --> 02:31:48.820
to give to Chris and Emma.

2245
02:31:48.820 --> 02:31:51.700
And finally just want to say that

2246
02:31:51.700 --> 02:31:54.340
I've had this amazing 20

2247
02:31:54.340 --> 02:31:57.340
plus year experience with Chris Emma

2248
02:31:57.340 --> 02:31:59.980
five movies over 20 years,

2249
02:31:59.980 --> 02:32:03.380
and it's been one of the most

2250
02:32:03.460 --> 02:32:07.900
exhilarating experiences
I've ever had a fantastic team,


2251
02:32:07.980 --> 02:32:12.460
and just to be part of making movies
with them has been completely thrilling.


2252
02:32:12.460 --> 02:32:22.460
So thank you so much

2253
02:32:33.340 --> 02:32:36.340
and that great
congratulations to Oppenheimer.


2254
02:32:36.380 --> 02:32:40.020
If only there was way for Christopher
Nolan to text his family to


2255
02:32:40.020 --> 02:32:43.180
tell them the good news.

2256
02:32:43.260 --> 02:32:44.300
That's it for our show.

2257
02:32:44.300 --> 02:32:46.060
I want to thank
the Academy for having me.

2258
02:32:46.060 --> 02:32:49.300
I want to thank our very hardworking
producers,


2259
02:32:49.300 --> 02:32:52.700
Raj Kapoor,
Katie Milan and Molly McInerney.


2260
02:32:52.780 --> 02:32:55.660
Thanks to our great announcer,

2261
02:32:55.660 --> 02:32:59.420

2262
02:32:59.420 --> 02:33:03.780
And the whole Oscars crew stay up
for a new Abbott Elementary and join me


2263
02:33:03.780 --> 02:33:07.700
on my show tomorrow with Dwayne Johnson,
Justin Timberlake and Robert De Niro.


2264
02:33:07.700 --> 02:33:08.580
Thanks for watching.

2265
02:33:08.580 --> 02:33:18.580
The 96th Oscars tonight

2266
02:33:32.940 --> 02:33:42.940
here,

2267
02:36:39.660 --> 02:36:41.740
all members of the academy
who are eligible


2268
02:36:41.740 --> 02:36:46.300
are invited to vote their nominations
for best picture in most other categories.


2269
02:36:46.300 --> 02:36:51.060
The nominations are decided by a vote
of the members in that specific category.


2270
02:36:51.140 --> 02:36:53.980
Then the entire membership chooses
from those nominations,


2271
02:36:53.980 --> 02:36:55.620
the recipients of the Oscars.

2272
02:36:55.620 --> 02:36:56.580
And finally,

2273
02:36:56.580 --> 02:37:00.140
the results of all the secret voting are
known only to the independent accounting


2274
02:37:00.140 --> 02:37:04.540
firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers until the
sealed envelopes are opened on the air.
