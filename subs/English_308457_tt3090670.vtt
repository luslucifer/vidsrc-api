1
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.260
In the past 10 years,

2
00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:38.029
the pace of communication
and commerce


3
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:39.931
accelerated astronomically,
didn't it?


4
00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:44.069
That lecture was interminable,
I need an espresso.


5
00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:47.606
<i>Duchess Carrie likes espresso.</i>

6
00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:49.574
<i>Who's Duchess Carrie?</i>

7
00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:52.844
Duchess Carrie likes certain
things, but not other things.


8
00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:55.087
<i>Can you figure out what</i>
<i>Duchess Carrie likes?</i>


9
00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.517
Caffeinated things?

10
00:01:58.519 --> 00:01:59.951
Caffeinated?

11
00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.152
- Tea?
<i>- Nope.</i>


12
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.192
With the Center's latest
technological innovation,


13
00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:10.729
we are working to empower the average
person with a pragmatic response


14
00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:12.531
to today's unforgiving jun...

15
00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:13.373
Today's...

16
00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:15.800
Impenetrable job market.

17
00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:21.973
<i>Uh, does she eat?</i>

18
00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:25.110
<i>She eats croissants</i>
<i>and crabapples.</i>


19
00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.813
She likes things
that begin with "C"?


20
00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.148
No. She enjoys espresso.

21
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.117
No collaborating.

22
00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:33.585
Croissants...

23
00:02:33.587 --> 00:02:34.886
She's French.

24
00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:36.922
You need to play
more games, Jules.


25
00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:38.957
Only one of you
can be the winner.


26
00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.800
If you cheat, then nobody wins.

27
00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.000
- And as a result...
- Adenine...


28
00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:50.235
And due to overpopulation...
<i>Cytosine.</i>


29
00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:51.870
Cytosine.

30
00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:53.071
- Today's job market...
<i>- Guanine.</i>


31
00:02:53.073 --> 00:02:55.640
Guanine.

32
00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:57.876
There's no surprise that anxiety
and depression... <i>Thiamine.</i>


33
00:02:57.878 --> 00:02:59.318
- ...have become the norm.
<i>- Uracil.</i>


34
00:03:15.861 --> 00:03:18.229
<i>Duchess Carrie</i>
<i>likes looking at the moon.</i>


35
00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:20.198
Duchess Carrie loves
feeling cool.


36
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.167
Moon, cool.

37
00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:23.368
Double letters...

38
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.303
Duchess Carrie
likes double letters.


39
00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:26.738
Jules already got it.

40
00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:46.858
Not again.

41
00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.053
Where's your umbrella?

42
00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:16.055
<i>It's not raining.</i>

43
00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.356
It is in Cherbourg.

44
00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:19.324
<i>Eternally?</i>

45
00:04:21.927 --> 00:04:25.797
<i>Dave, you're calling me.</i>

46
00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:28.433
Don't you think we should
give this a little more time?


47
00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:30.435
I need to talk to you
face to face.


48
00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:31.970
<i>I wasn't calling about us.</i>

49
00:04:31.972 --> 00:04:33.438
Mom!

50
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.272
<i>It's something much</i>
<i>more important.</i>


51
00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.041
End call.

52
00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:38.376
- Gwen?
<i>- This conversation has ended.</i>


53
00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:41.379
That's your mother?

54
00:04:42.748 --> 00:04:44.082
Yup.

55
00:04:44.084 --> 00:04:46.217
She doesn't even look
like a mom.


56
00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:47.819
Holo me when
you hear from Arcadia?


57
00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:49.701
Tell her about
the Eastern Board luncheon.


58
00:04:50.723 --> 00:04:52.723
I'll make sure my mom
holds you a spot.


59
00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.439
I like it. It's old looking.

60
00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:18.983
Who was that with you guys?
Amanda Malthis.


61
00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:21.886
Oh, you decided you like her?

62
00:05:21.888 --> 00:05:23.188
She has interesting moments.

63
00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:28.765
She wants me to go with her to
this bonding camp for Eastern.


64
00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:52.016
So they're saying that
all this wacky hormonal stuff,


65
00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:55.019
that's coming from pressure
to be hyper productive.


66
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:58.923
We have too many choices and we're making
the same ones over and over again.


67
00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:00.525
And they're the wrong
choices actually.


68
00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:03.027
So it's like
natural deselection.


69
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.764
Our DNA is opting out.

70
00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:11.234
Did you know that by the time I'm

71
00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:13.238
You know, for babies.

72
00:06:16.475 --> 00:06:18.443
You'd think awareness
would help things, but...


73
00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:19.844
Awareness influences things.

74
00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:21.146
It just takes time.

75
00:06:21.148 --> 00:06:22.080
How much time?

76
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:32.457
Jules.

77
00:06:36.862 --> 00:06:37.543
Jules.

78
00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:41.718
I was going to tell you when
you were a little bit older.


79
00:06:42.034 --> 00:06:43.101
About the eggs.

80
00:06:43.103 --> 00:06:45.403
I can adopt from other regions.

81
00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.405
There's always going to be orphans
who aren't as lucky as us,


82
00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.607
who need families.

83
00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:52.210
Exactly.

84
00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:54.332
And I've always wanted
a big family.


85
00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:10.295
Oh, crud.

86
00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:12.497
What?

87
00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:14.499
It's an automated message
from Arcadia.


88
00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:16.441
Uh, I can't listen.

89
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.943
<i>This is Melanie Matthews from
Arcadia Prep Dean's Office.</i>


90
00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:27.245
<i>Although Jules' grades</i>
<i>were top-notch</i>


91
00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:30.048
<i>and her test scores</i>
<i>were excellent,</i>


92
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.617
<i>there were a record number</i>
<i>of applications this year.</i>


93
00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:35.186
<i>And ultimately,</i>
<i>due to capacity issues,</i>


94
00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:37.429
<i>we could not make Jules</i>
<i>part of Arcadia Prep.</i>


95
00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:44.462
<i>And I see the workers
fill those buildings.</i>


96
00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:48.032
<i>These guys are going to get
our economy moving again</i>


97
00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:50.935
<i>with their innovation</i>
<i>and productivity.</i>


98
00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:52.857
<i>There is a bright future ahead.</i>

99
00:07:54.174 --> 00:07:56.474
<i>Rebel group Terra Mamoria</i>

100
00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:59.878
<i>is claiming responsibility for two of
the four nation's explosions today.</i>


101
00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:15.226
That's a beautiful one.

102
00:08:41.153 --> 00:08:45.223
<i>Here at the Center for</i>
<i>Advanced Health and Living,</i>


103
00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:50.662
<i>our procedure provides a solution
for any long-term health concerns.</i>


104
00:08:50.664 --> 00:08:55.166
<i>The experience is akin to a seamless
jump into a disease-free body</i>


105
00:08:55.168 --> 00:08:57.268
<i>of your choosing.</i>

106
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.938
<i>Through a lossless,</i>
<i>relatively painless process.</i>


107
00:09:02.308 --> 00:09:04.976
Would that this process
were more painless.


108
00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:06.611
Let's review Gwen's old test.

109
00:09:11.583 --> 00:09:14.552
It'll remind us of what
we're looking for.


110
00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:17.715
Do they know it could take a year to
find someone as uniquely qualified?


111
00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:19.958
Gwen Koh's test, please.

112
00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:24.228
<i>Username, please.</i>

113
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.231
Isa Cryer, damn it! We've been
here all afternoon.


114
00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:33.071
<i>In fact, the decisions</i>
<i>we make in life define us.</i>


115
00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:37.075
<i>So, shouldn't every woman be defined
by the totality of her choices?</i>


116
00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:40.345
<i>Rather than her race,</i>
<i>height or health?</i>


117
00:09:40.347 --> 00:09:43.715
<i>These are things she often</i>
<i>cannot control.</i>


118
00:09:43.717 --> 00:09:47.251
<i>Here at the Center for</i>
<i>Advanced Health and Living,</i>


119
00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:52.490
<i>we are working to offer you the safest
alternatives to invasive cosmetic surgery</i>


120
00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:55.560
<i>so you'll have every chance to
be the you you were meant to be.</i>


121
00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:12.229
Thanks for taking
my call, Dave.


122
00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:14.612
I'm sorry, Mr. Fisher.

123
00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:16.614
I know you're quite busy.

124
00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.082
<i>That's all right, what's up?</i>

125
00:10:18.084 --> 00:10:20.418
I've been thinking about
my contract renewal.


126
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.554
I've been working
below rate for a while.


127
00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:27.425
<i>Yes. You know, we've just</i>
<i>been talking about that.</i>


128
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.062
You were?

129
00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:34.632
<i>Marketing just submitted a report
showing pretty clearly that</i>


130
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:39.170
<i>a younger demographic would benefit
from awareness of our technology.</i>


131
00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:43.808
<i>And we simply can't afford to
alienate any potential market.</i>


132
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.744
Of course.

133
00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:50.348
<i>The board just realized,
albeit on the late side,</i>


134
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:55.620
<i>that we're obligated to go a different
direction for the face of the Center.</i>


135
00:11:00.492 --> 00:11:03.361
Have... Have you already
found your younger candidate?


136
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.465
<i>They've started to search.</i>

137
00:11:07.467 --> 00:11:09.667
<i>Isa Cryer is aggressively</i>
<i>reviewing candidates.</i>


138
00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:13.538
<i>Gwen, I did fight for you.</i>

139
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.175
<i>There's no question that you possess the
highest level of poise, talent and beauty.</i>


140
00:11:18.243 --> 00:11:19.143
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

141
00:11:23.615 --> 00:11:25.316
No. I'm sorry.

142
00:11:25.318 --> 00:11:26.384
I'm sorry.

143
00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:31.936
Jules didn't get into Arcadia.

144
00:11:33.225 --> 00:11:36.127
And I don't know why.
She's brilliant.


145
00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:38.969
<i>Oh, you know, it's just as likely
you didn't know the right people.</i>


146
00:11:39.731 --> 00:11:41.265
<i>Did she get in anywhere else?</i>

147
00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:43.367
Eastern.

148
00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:44.469
<i>Oh, well, with Eastern on her
transcript, she'll have options.</i>


149
00:11:44.471 --> 00:11:45.870
<i>My daughters went there.</i>

150
00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:49.352
I know, but tuition has
doubled since your daughters.


151
00:11:50.442 --> 00:11:52.577
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

152
00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:54.512
<i>You're going to land</i>
<i>on your feet.</i>


153
00:11:54.514 --> 00:11:55.847
<i>You have to.</i>

154
00:12:32.184 --> 00:12:34.025
Upstairs woman
or downstairs woman?


155
00:12:51.737 --> 00:12:52.803
Both.

156
00:13:09.721 --> 00:13:10.922
Why aren't you at school?

157
00:13:10.924 --> 00:13:12.890
Conservation day.
Are you going to Paris?


158
00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:15.927
Mmm-mmm. I have a short day too,
so I could meet you after piano.


159
00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:18.170
Did you have your first
taste of the day?


160
00:13:18.797 --> 00:13:19.931
<i>Incoming call.</i>

161
00:13:19.933 --> 00:13:22.466
Hello, this is Gwen.

162
00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:24.535
<i>Hello, Gwen. This is Drake with
Dream No More outplacement network.</i>


163
00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:25.803
Oh, hello, Drake.

164
00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.939
Uh, just one second, please.

165
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:30.274
<i>Sure.</i> I have to go. Are
you set for today?


166
00:13:30.276 --> 00:13:31.876
Uh, what should we
tell Amanda's mom?


167
00:13:31.878 --> 00:13:33.878
About? The Eastern luncheon.

168
00:13:35.414 --> 00:13:37.414
Tell her I'll be there.
Get more details.


169
00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:40.585
So I can go to Eastern?

170
00:13:40.587 --> 00:13:42.907
I got a call yesterday...
About the raise?


171
00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:46.490
Yes, about the raise.

172
00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:54.899
<i>Gwen, I called to let you
know, that your information</i>


173
00:13:54.901 --> 00:13:56.934
<i>as of 3:30 a.m. this morning,</i>

174
00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:59.303
<i>is in our system and</i>
<i>you're good to go.</i>


175
00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:00.745
I'm actually on my
way in to see you.


176
00:14:00.973 --> 00:14:03.341
<i>Why?</i>

177
00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:05.610
Well, don't you have a speech to give
me and then we sit down together


178
00:14:05.612 --> 00:14:07.813
and focus on
the new days ahead?


179
00:14:07.814 --> 00:14:10.248
<i>Sounds good, but you're
already a noted professional.</i>


180
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.650
Thank you.

181
00:14:12.652 --> 00:14:14.772
<i>I'll be in touch the moment</i>
<i>we get a response.</i>


182
00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:16.320
Great.

183
00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:26.497
<i>There's one space you</i>
<i>could fill right away.</i>


184
00:14:26.499 --> 00:14:28.799
I'm sorry. Yes?

185
00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:31.922
<i>Your recent physical pre-qualifies
you to be a paid egg donor.</i>


186
00:14:33.739 --> 00:14:36.440
An egg donor?

187
00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:39.603
<i>It could offset living costs until we
find you something more permanent.</i>


188
00:14:40.712 --> 00:14:43.547
<i>Many women are not able</i>
<i>to have children anymore.</i>


189
00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:46.717
<i>And due to the great demand, the
donor age threshold has risen.</i>


190
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.891
<i>Miss Koh?</i>

191
00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.133
How long does the process take?

192
00:14:55.861 --> 00:14:57.628
<i>Three months.</i>

193
00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.964
<i>You'll be paid</i>
<i>after the harvest.</i>


194
00:14:59.966 --> 00:15:03.734
That's not soon enough. Can we just focus
on the jobs that I've outlined on my form?


195
00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:04.802
<i>Certainly.</i>

196
00:15:05.804 --> 00:15:06.885
Take what you can get.

197
00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:09.953
<i>Have a lovely day, Miss Koh.</i>

198
00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:18.916
Are you okay?

199
00:15:20.652 --> 00:15:21.719
Are you?

200
00:16:18.377 --> 00:16:19.543
<i>Username, please.</i>

201
00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:20.978
Gwen Koh.

202
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.446
<i>That entity does not exist.</i>

203
00:16:22.448 --> 00:16:24.849
<i>Please try again.</i> Gwen Koh.

204
00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:26.917
<i>That entity does not exist.</i>

205
00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:28.419
<i>Hello Gwen.</i>

206
00:16:28.421 --> 00:16:30.421
Evan, my ID's not scanning.

207
00:16:30.822 --> 00:16:32.089
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

208
00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:35.059
Is Dave Fisher in?

209
00:16:35.927 --> 00:16:37.795
<i>He's off site at the lab.</i>

210
00:16:37.797 --> 00:16:38.896
<i>Is that wardrobe?</i>

211
00:16:40.031 --> 00:16:41.098
Yes.

212
00:16:42.868 --> 00:16:44.628
<i>Please hold.</i> Thank you.

213
00:17:03.088 --> 00:17:03.954
Closer.

214
00:17:14.566 --> 00:17:15.633
Closer.

215
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:25.750
I found a solution
to our problem, Fisher.


216
00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:34.151
I'm sorry. I'm a bit surprised.

217
00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:36.434
I've rarely seen you
over the years.


218
00:17:36.988 --> 00:17:38.388
The dungeon's being renovated.

219
00:17:41.526 --> 00:17:43.627
Yours too?

220
00:17:45.997 --> 00:17:48.132
How's the job search?

221
00:17:48.134 --> 00:17:50.034
Well, there's been interest
in the past. So...


222
00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:51.469
I'm not worried.

223
00:17:52.504 --> 00:17:53.971
You've been pursued?

224
00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.121
By companies at our level?

225
00:18:00.145 --> 00:18:02.246
Well, I'm hardly surprised.

226
00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:04.548
People connect to you.

227
00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.650
The question that we have to answer
is in this current job market,


228
00:18:06.652 --> 00:18:10.020
with shifting desirability targets,
can they get ahead looking like you?


229
00:18:10.889 --> 00:18:13.157
And at your age?

230
00:18:13.159 --> 00:18:15.199
My position here wasn't only
about being a face.


231
00:18:16.528 --> 00:18:18.963
And the knowledge
I've acquired here,


232
00:18:18.965 --> 00:18:20.965
I can carry
into other positions.


233
00:18:20.967 --> 00:18:22.032
Teaching, for instance.

234
00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:23.167
You've taught before?

235
00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:25.142
In grad school.

236
00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:28.038
In grad school?

237
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.907
Well, even in the real world,

238
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:32.576
you won't make close to what
you were making here.


239
00:18:32.578 --> 00:18:34.578
The education profession has
gone pure tech.


240
00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.715
There is nothing in our generation's
skill pool that can compete.


241
00:18:40.151 --> 00:18:42.219
Well, there must be something

242
00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:44.822
in a mere human existence
that has value.


243
00:18:46.691 --> 00:18:48.859
You and I, in our lifetimes,
will see progress


244
00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:52.196
1,000 times greater
than the previous century.


245
00:18:52.198 --> 00:18:53.697
But, because we're mere humans,

246
00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:55.633
we won't be able
to comprehend it.


247
00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:58.155
Humans can only grasp change at
a rate they've experienced it.


248
00:19:00.805 --> 00:19:02.845
<i>Which is why they</i>
<i>are being left behind.</i>


249
00:19:08.947 --> 00:19:10.114
How is your daughter?

250
00:19:12.851 --> 00:19:14.251
I understand she's quite
a talent.


251
00:19:17.055 --> 00:19:19.056
She keeps me alive.

252
00:19:20.058 --> 00:19:21.191
As do my girls.

253
00:19:24.763 --> 00:19:27.097
There is nothing fiercer
than a mother's love.


254
00:19:36.908 --> 00:19:38.309
Hello, Drake.

255
00:19:38.311 --> 00:19:39.677
<i>Hey, Claire.</i>

256
00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:42.279
Uh, no. This is Gwen Koh.

257
00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:43.347
<i>Hello, Gwen.</i>

258
00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:45.229
I see here you just called me.

259
00:19:46.985 --> 00:19:48.218
Drake?

260
00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.920
<i>Yes, Gwen.</i>

261
00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:52.322
Have you heard something?
Do I have an interview?


262
00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:55.893
<i>There's been some activity</i>
<i>on your account.</i>


263
00:19:55.895 --> 00:19:57.828
<i>You've received</i>
<i>several inquiries.</i>


264
00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.831
<i>And one counter endorsement.</i>

265
00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:02.633
Counter endorsement?

266
00:20:02.635 --> 00:20:05.069
<i>A flag has been raised about</i>
<i>a detail on your resume.</i>


267
00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:10.975
<i>It is currently</i>
<i>under investigation.</i>


268
00:20:10.977 --> 00:20:13.698
It's a mistake. I have
verifications for everything.


269
00:20:18.183 --> 00:20:21.819
Drake, can I ask who's filed
this counter endorsement?


270
00:20:21.821 --> 00:20:25.689
<i>Huh, would you like me to tell</i>
<i>you my astrological sign too?</i>


271
00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:26.924
I'm sorry?

272
00:20:28.226 --> 00:20:30.828
<i>Are you sorry?</i>

273
00:20:34.899 --> 00:20:37.701
Drake, are you a human being?

274
00:20:37.703 --> 00:20:41.672
<i>That's a funny question. How
do you define a human being?</i>


275
00:20:41.674 --> 00:20:43.754
Do you have blood running
through your veins?


276
00:20:46.978 --> 00:20:49.213
<i>That is a definition</i>
<i>of a human being?</i>


277
00:20:56.955 --> 00:20:58.422
I didn't know.

278
00:20:58.424 --> 00:21:00.257
<i>That sounds more like</i>
<i>a human being.</i>


279
00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:01.825
<i>Not to know.</i>

280
00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:10.100
Account information.

281
00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:12.102
<i>Gwen Koh.</i> Balance, please.

282
00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:13.945
<i>Checking or saving...</i> Combined.

283
00:21:13.972 --> 00:21:17.041
<i>743 units.</i>

284
00:21:17.043 --> 00:21:20.377
<i>Automatic payment will be
made after...</i> Cancel automatic payment.

285
00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:21.311
<i>Canceled.</i>

286
00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:36.427
How long will you
be staying today?


287
00:21:36.429 --> 00:21:37.309
How much is it again?

288
00:21:39.197 --> 00:21:40.264
Alone?

289
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.540
Did you need company?

290
00:21:44.903 --> 00:21:45.969
No.

291
00:23:07.786 --> 00:23:09.353
Did you hear me?
I was terrible.


292
00:23:09.355 --> 00:23:10.420
No, you weren't,
where's Ginger?


293
00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:12.823
I told her not to come over.

294
00:23:12.825 --> 00:23:15.526
Holoprof was trying to finish the 20th
and 21st centuries in one class period.


295
00:23:15.528 --> 00:23:17.828
All I remember is
the 2033 bubble


296
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.898
and the New York traditionalist movement,
which he said is taking over now.


297
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.366
Which I challenged.

298
00:23:22.368 --> 00:23:24.935
Are women really going
backwards going forward?


299
00:23:24.937 --> 00:23:25.803
You're not.

300
00:23:28.072 --> 00:23:30.313
Let's get you something to eat.

301
00:23:39.317 --> 00:23:41.018
Uh, she's not open.

302
00:23:56.201 --> 00:23:57.467
I don't know why I'm alive.

303
00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.208
That's a bit extreme.

304
00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:05.342
What happened with Ginger?

305
00:24:05.344 --> 00:24:06.265
There's so much to do.

306
00:24:07.912 --> 00:24:10.514
I need to exercise more,
study more,


307
00:24:10.516 --> 00:24:13.150
I need to do more
volunteer work in art.


308
00:24:13.152 --> 00:24:16.320
I need to be smarter, nicer,
prettier and classier.


309
00:24:18.122 --> 00:24:19.489
But what's the point?

310
00:24:21.125 --> 00:24:22.966
Many reasons. Like?

311
00:24:24.362 --> 00:24:25.602
Music.

312
00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:32.569
Being loved by your
amazing mother.


313
00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:34.471
None of you know
what you're doing.


314
00:24:34.473 --> 00:24:36.907
You all pretend
to have a plan for us,


315
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:40.410
but everyone's just
either greedy or desperate.


316
00:24:43.548 --> 00:24:45.549
Why did you have me?

317
00:24:45.551 --> 00:24:48.272
When you knew the world was so bad
and you had to struggle so much.


318
00:24:50.521 --> 00:24:52.422
You're all alone
with no one to help you.


319
00:24:54.425 --> 00:24:57.865
There was a time when I was
also confused why I was alive.


320
00:25:00.131 --> 00:25:02.611
And I guess something
in me thought that...


321
00:25:07.505 --> 00:25:09.465
I mean, I thought having you

322
00:25:10.341 --> 00:25:12.209
might make my life more...

323
00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:15.379
Worthwhile?

324
00:25:19.517 --> 00:25:21.318
You make me very happy.

325
00:25:49.714 --> 00:25:51.315
<i>Archived message.</i>

326
00:25:51.317 --> 00:25:54.651
<i>Hi, this is Lily.</i>

327
00:25:54.653 --> 00:25:56.420
<i>Your one and only cousin?</i>

328
00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:00.490
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

329
00:26:04.028 --> 00:26:05.228
<i>I'm at the restaurant.</i>

330
00:26:08.666 --> 00:26:10.267
<i>I still worry about you.</i>

331
00:26:14.305 --> 00:26:17.007
<i>It must be really hard to be</i>
<i>on your own these days.</i>


332
00:26:20.713 --> 00:26:23.046
<i>Tomorrow's events.</i>

333
00:26:23.048 --> 00:26:25.415
<i>Eastern Board luncheon.</i>

334
00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:26.778
<i>I hope you have somebody.</i>

335
00:26:28.152 --> 00:26:29.713
<i>Would you like</i>
<i>to send a response?</i>


336
00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:35.392
<i>For our next hour,</i>

337
00:26:35.394 --> 00:26:39.529
<i>we'll be discussing the recent rise
in child prostitution in our country.</i>


338
00:26:39.531 --> 00:26:41.431
<i>Its causes, symptoms and...</i>

339
00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:43.633
One week of water left.

340
00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:45.135
<i>A report last week from
the Department of...</i>


341
00:26:45.137 --> 00:26:47.537
I should get paid tomorrow.

342
00:26:47.539 --> 00:26:50.173
<i>Found that 4% of girls and boys
between the ages of 12 and 18,</i>


343
00:26:50.175 --> 00:26:52.376
<i>will have taken part</i>
<i>in a sex work activity...</i>


344
00:27:11.729 --> 00:27:12.969
Where did you get this recipe?

345
00:27:16.734 --> 00:27:18.068
My cousin Lily.

346
00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:21.204
Lily from the picture?

347
00:27:25.043 --> 00:27:28.763
Yup. She taught me when I had
to work at her restaurant.


348
00:27:53.104 --> 00:27:54.204
Gwen Koh.

349
00:28:00.579 --> 00:28:02.699
How wonderful you
could join us.


350
00:28:04.215 --> 00:28:05.248
Oh!

351
00:28:07.218 --> 00:28:10.587
My Amanda has told me so
much about you and Jules.


352
00:28:13.157 --> 00:28:15.425
Gwen is the head of the Center
for Advanced Health and Living.


353
00:28:15.427 --> 00:28:19.129
One of the most forward thinking
companies in our midst.


354
00:28:19.131 --> 00:28:21.598
About to reveal the biotech
bubble of the moment.


355
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.467
You're a scientist?

356
00:28:23.469 --> 00:28:26.136
Oh, not exactly.

357
00:28:26.138 --> 00:28:29.673
Olivia's intrigued by any woman making
her way through the job climate today.


358
00:28:29.675 --> 00:28:31.715
Especially with the backlash
we're experiencing.


359
00:28:36.515 --> 00:28:37.447
I'm sorry.

360
00:28:47.358 --> 00:28:49.659
We would have moved forward
a while ago,


361
00:28:49.661 --> 00:28:51.661
but her father has clout.

362
00:28:54.532 --> 00:28:56.366
We do what is best for
our children.


363
00:28:57.768 --> 00:28:58.835
We do.

364
00:29:00.338 --> 00:29:02.706
We studied Jules' CV,

365
00:29:02.708 --> 00:29:05.809
it's clear your agenda for your daughter
is as your career, unstoppable.


366
00:29:07.778 --> 00:29:09.913
Gwen, the mission of our bonding
camp is hundreds of years old


367
00:29:09.915 --> 00:29:12.649
and 100 years into the future.

368
00:29:12.651 --> 00:29:17.454
We comingle the finest boys and girls, in
advance of their prep school experience.


369
00:29:17.456 --> 00:29:20.757
Have them introduce their innate
talents and dreams to one another.


370
00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:24.327
To create a culture that will cohesify them
through their years together in school.


371
00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:26.563
In our world's history, even
when resources were limited,


372
00:29:26.565 --> 00:29:28.832
there's always been room
for an elite.


373
00:29:28.834 --> 00:29:30.700
As there's less room now,

374
00:29:30.702 --> 00:29:34.237
we're putting our brains and our
pocketbooks where it counts.


375
00:29:37.775 --> 00:29:39.342
This all sounds good.

376
00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:42.279
Good?

377
00:29:42.281 --> 00:29:43.380
Ideal.

378
00:29:44.448 --> 00:29:46.249
I'm just wondering...

379
00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:48.952
We've put in 30K each,
we would ask you for 10,


380
00:29:48.954 --> 00:29:50.674
to hold the waitlist spot
for Jules.


381
00:29:52.323 --> 00:29:54.391
I might need a day or two.

382
00:29:54.393 --> 00:29:56.359
Loosen up Jules' father.

383
00:29:58.363 --> 00:30:00.204
He's not a part of our lives.

384
00:30:03.568 --> 00:30:04.734
And isn't going to be?

385
00:30:07.638 --> 00:30:09.339
Not even Jules' life?

386
00:30:18.649 --> 00:30:19.689
That is a wild card.

387
00:30:26.791 --> 00:30:27.857
Hello, dear.

388
00:30:36.901 --> 00:30:38.935
This is the only time
in your daughter's life


389
00:30:38.937 --> 00:30:40.897
when her choices
will make a difference.


390
00:30:44.442 --> 00:30:45.909
Take the help you can get.

391
00:31:08.733 --> 00:31:11.668
<i>Gwen, look at us.</i>

392
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.903
<i>We're talking again</i>
<i>after all these years.</i>


393
00:31:13.905 --> 00:31:16.640
<i>What a blessing.</i>

394
00:31:16.642 --> 00:31:19.943
<i>So let's do this right, okay,</i>
<i>and learn from our mistakes?</i>


395
00:31:19.945 --> 00:31:22.379
<i>I'm truly sorry for leaving
you alone with Jules</i>


396
00:31:22.381 --> 00:31:23.581
<i>and turning my back on you.</i>

397
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.230
Mom, thank you
for saying that, but...


398
00:31:29.553 --> 00:31:32.355
I have to get something
together, now. Or else...


399
00:31:32.357 --> 00:31:34.524
<i>Or else you'll continue</i>
<i>to suffer, I know.</i>


400
00:31:34.526 --> 00:31:35.566
<i>And so will Jules.</i>

401
00:31:38.362 --> 00:31:40.203
<i>So, how much money do you need?</i>

402
00:31:41.933 --> 00:31:43.900
$40,000 would get us
through the next month.


403
00:31:46.771 --> 00:31:48.605
<i>$40,000?</i>

404
00:31:48.607 --> 00:31:50.340
Access costs money, Mom.
You know that.


405
00:31:53.311 --> 00:31:55.231
<i>So, who does she look like now?</i>

406
00:31:55.846 --> 00:31:56.967
She looks like herself.

407
00:31:59.016 --> 00:32:01.584
<i>Well, send me</i>
<i>some pictures, okay?</i>


408
00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:03.747
<i>You know, it doesn't matter</i>
<i>who she looks like.</i>


409
00:32:10.461 --> 00:32:14.097
<i>Your father thinks</i>
<i>about you, you know?</i>


410
00:32:14.099 --> 00:32:15.665
<i>He talked about you</i>
<i>in his sermon today.</i>


411
00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:16.733
Mom, don't.

412
00:32:27.478 --> 00:32:29.579
<i>Okay, uh, let me call Dad.</i>

413
00:32:29.581 --> 00:32:30.747
No!

414
00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:34.984
<i>If I don't ask your father...</i>

415
00:32:34.986 --> 00:32:36.827
He's not ever going to meet
my daughter, Mom.


416
00:32:37.722 --> 00:32:39.402
I will die before that happens.

417
00:32:40.358 --> 00:32:41.791
<i>Gwen.</i>

418
00:32:46.731 --> 00:32:47.864
<i>He's changed.</i>

419
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.181
<i>God has forgiven him.</i>

420
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:54.871
<i>Your father says</i>
<i>I can't help you.</i>


421
00:32:54.873 --> 00:32:56.840
Aren't you still working?

422
00:32:56.842 --> 00:32:59.008
<i>Let's pray</i>
<i>for your forgiveness.</i>


423
00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:00.910
<i>Remember,</i>
<i>you used to love to pray?</i>


424
00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:02.273
I... <i>Dear Lord,</i>

425
00:33:02.913 --> 00:33:05.882
<i>please listen to us.</i>

426
00:33:05.884 --> 00:33:07.786
<i>At this time, we're ready
for you to take away...</i>


427
00:33:07.812 --> 00:33:08.585
I'm hanging up now.

428
00:33:08.587 --> 00:33:10.587
<i>This sin that</i>
<i>Gwen has committed.</i>


429
00:33:10.589 --> 00:33:12.455
Goodbye. <i>Thank you for your
infinite patience, dear Lord.</i>


430
00:33:12.457 --> 00:33:14.724
I love you, Mama.

431
00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:17.012
<i>And your infinite mercy
that you have shown Gwen.</i>


432
00:33:17.038 --> 00:33:17.952
Goodbye. End call.

433
00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.164
<i>Please look down</i>
<i>on her now with love</i>


434
00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:22.565
<i>and heal her of this sin.</i>

435
00:33:25.703 --> 00:33:28.037
<i>Help her to start</i>
<i>a brand new life.</i>


436
00:33:28.039 --> 00:33:30.439
<i>A brand new life with you</i>
<i>at the center of her heart.</i>


437
00:33:32.076 --> 00:33:34.010
<i>And please...</i>

438
00:33:34.012 --> 00:33:36.446
<i>Please watch out for Jules</i>

439
00:33:36.448 --> 00:33:38.968
<i>and wrap her in your
loving care, dear Lord.</i>


440
00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.901
<i>Sorry, how've you been?</i>

441
00:34:00.838 --> 00:34:01.959
Am I too old?

442
00:34:02.773 --> 00:34:03.933
To be of use?

443
00:34:07.044 --> 00:34:08.444
<i>What're you talking about,</i>
<i>Gwen?</i>


444
00:34:10.114 --> 00:34:12.474
<i>So many women are out of work.</i>

445
00:34:12.983 --> 00:34:15.218
<i>Some are in real trouble.</i>

446
00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:17.821
<i>To be frank, there is talk</i>
<i>among recruiters about</i>


447
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:20.910
<i>letting women</i>
<i>stay unemployed and,</i>


448
00:34:21.959 --> 00:34:25.028
<i>well, return to the home.</i>

449
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:28.590
<i>The perception is it's safer than putting
millions of desperate men on the street.</i>


450
00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:32.135
Safer? For whom?

451
00:34:33.604 --> 00:34:34.471
<i>Everyone.</i>

452
00:34:37.541 --> 00:34:39.421
Make me the younger candidate.

453
00:34:40.578 --> 00:34:41.744
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

454
00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:43.026
The procedure
you're launching...


455
00:34:43.781 --> 00:34:45.849
Use it on me.

456
00:34:45.851 --> 00:34:48.092
Put me into a younger body.

457
00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.921
<i>We haven't had any civilian</i>
<i>test subjects yet.</i>


458
00:34:51.923 --> 00:34:53.957
I want to be the face
of the Center again.


459
00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:56.079
I've done all
the prep work already.


460
00:34:56.594 --> 00:34:58.674
I'd be both
an expert and a user.


461
00:34:58.996 --> 00:35:00.236
Your ideal spokesperson.

462
00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:05.921
I'm the best there is
at this job.


463
00:35:11.108 --> 00:35:12.175
Can I talk about this later?

464
00:35:12.177 --> 00:35:13.710
I really need to do this later.

465
00:35:13.712 --> 00:35:15.178
I can't get an interview,
Dave, not one.


466
00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:16.140
<i>I really have to go.</i>

467
00:35:17.915 --> 00:35:21.084
I have to position Jules now.

468
00:35:21.086 --> 00:35:23.820
<i>If I can get her into a good
school, she'll have a chance.</i>


469
00:35:23.822 --> 00:35:25.255
I can't let her become
one of these women,


470
00:35:25.257 --> 00:35:27.017
so desperate
that they would do anything.


471
00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.594
Dave,

472
00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:33.996
you would do the same
for your own girls,


473
00:35:34.665 --> 00:35:35.905
if you were in my place.

474
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:47.644
<i>Marketing has a specific</i>
<i>physical type in mind.</i>


475
00:35:47.646 --> 00:35:50.726
<i>They're looking at candidates that
come off as a touch more universal.</i>


476
00:35:52.082 --> 00:35:55.118
<i>So if I could tell them</i>
<i>that you'd be willing to</i>


477
00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:58.021
<i>give them full control over the
creation of your host body,</i>


478
00:35:58.023 --> 00:35:59.824
that might show them
how much you care about


479
00:36:01.025 --> 00:36:02.091
the product's success.

480
00:36:12.202 --> 00:36:13.269
<i>Okay.</i>

481
00:36:15.806 --> 00:36:16.927
You'd be willing to do that?

482
00:36:21.245 --> 00:36:23.725
The point is to push
the product, right?


483
00:36:24.048 --> 00:36:25.081
<i>When isn't it?</i>

484
00:36:27.651 --> 00:36:28.411
I'll talk to them.

485
00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:30.941
<i>Thank you.</i>

486
00:36:34.792 --> 00:36:36.025
Evan?

487
00:36:36.027 --> 00:36:37.360
<i>Yes, Miss Cryer.</i>

488
00:36:37.362 --> 00:36:39.596
Make replications
of Fisher's last call.


489
00:36:39.598 --> 00:36:41.064
CC the Board.

490
00:36:41.066 --> 00:36:41.931
<i>Working on it.</i>

491
00:36:51.809 --> 00:36:53.376
Couldn't say this
on the record,


492
00:36:53.378 --> 00:36:55.912
but most of our test subjects
develop breathing issues.


493
00:36:57.815 --> 00:37:00.149
They have to get a shot
every two hours for a year.


494
00:37:02.086 --> 00:37:03.326
There's recurring pain.

495
00:37:05.022 --> 00:37:06.623
I'll deal with it.

496
00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:12.395
Evan, what's wrong
with our filters?


497
00:37:12.397 --> 00:37:14.263
I can barely understand them.

498
00:37:14.265 --> 00:37:15.164
<i>There's an error.</i>

499
00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.060
<i>Working on it.</i>

500
00:37:21.839 --> 00:37:23.839
The board was expecting
you'd offer yourself up.


501
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:27.510
You're the logical next step.

502
00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.261
After this, the board'll wanna
protect their show piece,


503
00:37:35.686 --> 00:37:36.846
Jules'll get what she needs.

504
00:37:39.156 --> 00:37:41.658
Are you ready to
explain all this to her?


505
00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.159
I've been trying
not to think about it.


506
00:37:43.161 --> 00:37:44.227
Well, think about it.

507
00:37:55.205 --> 00:37:57.245
This might be a bigger
sacrifice than you imagine.


508
00:37:59.009 --> 00:38:00.710
Gwen, it's not like you're
a consciousness in a jar


509
00:38:00.712 --> 00:38:03.146
that we're dumping
into another jar.


510
00:38:03.148 --> 00:38:04.469
The technology
is not there yet.


511
00:38:06.216 --> 00:38:07.456
What's the reality then?

512
00:38:15.325 --> 00:38:17.325
<i>It's the location.</i>
<i>I don't think there is a fix.</i>


513
00:38:18.929 --> 00:38:21.164
What're you trying
to hide from me, Fisher?


514
00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:27.270
Please don't do this.

515
00:38:32.843 --> 00:38:35.124
But this is still Jules'
only chance though, isn't it?


516
00:38:41.151 --> 00:38:43.352
You know it is.
You just won't say it.


517
00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:48.384
I'm not going to get
another job.


518
00:38:49.126 --> 00:38:50.366
They'll make sure of it.

519
00:38:56.133 --> 00:38:57.200
I want

520
00:39:00.738 --> 00:39:01.978
Christmas with her first.

521
00:40:35.933 --> 00:40:36.599
What's wrong?

522
00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:40.403
Nothing.

523
00:40:40.405 --> 00:40:42.071
I was thinking about dinner.

524
00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:34.183
If I had to go away,

525
00:42:34.185 --> 00:42:36.619
you'd be able to take care
of things here, right?


526
00:42:36.621 --> 00:42:37.661
You'd do okay without me.

527
00:42:40.257 --> 00:42:42.058
I guess so. How long?

528
00:42:44.428 --> 00:42:47.129
I don't know. A while.

529
00:42:47.131 --> 00:42:48.331
A while sounds too long.

530
00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:07.562
I hope you think you're pretty.

531
00:43:09.519 --> 00:43:12.188
Sometimes.

532
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:15.630
If someone asked you to change
something about the way you look,


533
00:43:15.692 --> 00:43:16.892
what would it be?

534
00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:23.733
My nose skinnier, my shins
longer, my jumps higher.


535
00:43:23.735 --> 00:43:24.656
We did this in class.

536
00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:31.440
And what would you change
about me?


537
00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:34.131
Nothing.

538
00:43:37.481 --> 00:43:41.050
We're going through
a shift at work.


539
00:43:41.052 --> 00:43:42.413
It comes along with my raise.

540
00:43:44.154 --> 00:43:45.394
What kind of shift?

541
00:43:46.423 --> 00:43:48.157
In my appearance.

542
00:43:48.159 --> 00:43:49.839
They want to appeal
to younger audiences.


543
00:43:54.297 --> 00:43:55.537
I guess that makes sense.

544
00:43:56.566 --> 00:43:58.847
It's good that
they'll pay for it.


545
00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:16.819
They're here.

546
00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.280
Goodbye, Miss Koh.

547
00:44:57.694 --> 00:45:00.529
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

548
00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:04.567
<i>Everyone's calling their
families before we go tech-free.</i>


549
00:45:04.569 --> 00:45:07.609
<i>But you can still reach me through
the camp office if you need me.</i>


550
00:45:09.773 --> 00:45:11.053
<i>It's super beautiful out here.</i>

551
00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:12.796
<i>Really quiet.</i>

552
00:45:14.411 --> 00:45:16.291
<i>I think I just heard</i>
<i>myself blink.</i>


553
00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:18.394
<i>I love you.</i>

554
00:45:21.284 --> 00:45:23.284
<i>I hope you're not</i>
<i>working too hard.</i>


555
00:45:24.254 --> 00:45:26.455
<i>You should go out</i>
<i>and celebrate your big raise.</i>


556
00:45:33.363 --> 00:45:34.230
<i>New message.</i>

557
00:45:35.799 --> 00:45:37.466
<i>Hi.</i>

558
00:45:37.468 --> 00:45:38.501
<i>It's Lily, again.</i>

559
00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:45.207
<i>I hope you got my last message.</i>

560
00:45:45.209 --> 00:45:47.249
<i>I wanted to wish you</i>
<i>a happy birthday.</i>


561
00:45:49.646 --> 00:45:50.846
<i>You know where to find us.</i>

562
00:47:27.377 --> 00:47:28.711
I remembered the code.

563
00:47:29.646 --> 00:47:30.767
All three of our birthdays.

564
00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:36.258
We never changed it.

565
00:47:41.491 --> 00:47:42.371
Just one minute.

566
00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:55.437
Is Lily out there?

567
00:47:55.439 --> 00:47:59.080
You need to call us first and say
exactly why you wanna see us.


568
00:47:59.443 --> 00:48:01.543
Han!

569
00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:03.706
Okay, we're not putting her
through this. Please.


570
00:48:05.282 --> 00:48:06.242
Hey.

571
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:08.817
I'm sorry, okay?

572
00:48:08.819 --> 00:48:11.139
I didn't know that.
Okay, I'm coming.


573
00:48:13.923 --> 00:48:15.591
Okay, she's had a long day.

574
00:48:15.593 --> 00:48:16.793
It's not a good time for this.

575
00:48:17.527 --> 00:48:19.295
I need to... Please.

576
00:48:19.297 --> 00:48:20.863
Go. Please don't do this.

577
00:48:24.067 --> 00:48:25.307
I am begging you.

578
00:48:50.026 --> 00:48:51.827
You need to stop watching
those crime shows.


579
00:48:53.596 --> 00:48:55.431
What's the matter? Nothing.

580
00:48:55.433 --> 00:48:57.733
Where are the boys? They're
waiting for you in the car.


581
00:48:57.735 --> 00:49:00.102
You're taking them to
practice, right? Yeah.


582
00:49:00.104 --> 00:49:01.904
Thank you, honey.

583
00:49:01.906 --> 00:49:03.267
I'll go pick up menus
for dinner.


584
00:49:09.612 --> 00:49:10.946
I have to see her now.

585
00:49:10.948 --> 00:49:12.981
Lily! Lily!

586
00:49:19.989 --> 00:49:21.924
Well, this is a nice surprise.

587
00:49:21.926 --> 00:49:23.846
But we're about
to open for dinner.


588
00:49:24.794 --> 00:49:25.861
No.

589
00:49:26.863 --> 00:49:28.063
We have time.

590
00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:29.965
It's fine.

591
00:49:32.135 --> 00:49:33.001
Go get the boys.

592
00:49:34.003 --> 00:49:35.070
You should meet.

593
00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:38.607
Lily, do you remember...

594
00:49:38.609 --> 00:49:40.729
Gwen, we're really busy today.

595
00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.647
You know, don't you?

596
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:51.387
Yes.

597
00:49:52.756 --> 00:49:53.622
Han told me.

598
00:49:57.093 --> 00:49:58.053
It was a long time ago.

599
00:50:00.663 --> 00:50:01.744
I had a child.

600
00:50:04.567 --> 00:50:05.434
When?

601
00:50:08.872 --> 00:50:09.972
We...

602
00:50:11.708 --> 00:50:12.775
Had a child.

603
00:50:15.445 --> 00:50:16.578
That's not possible.

604
00:50:17.781 --> 00:50:19.014
She was seeing other guys.

605
00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:20.137
I lied about that.

606
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:28.750
Well, then you're lying
about this.


607
00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:30.893
- No. Her name is Jules.
- No.


608
00:50:30.895 --> 00:50:32.095
- She just turned 13.
- No. No.


609
00:50:34.964 --> 00:50:36.131
You can't do it this way.

610
00:50:40.203 --> 00:50:41.670
And so I stayed away
as long as I could,


611
00:50:41.672 --> 00:50:43.632
because I didn't want to do
any more damage.


612
00:50:45.575 --> 00:50:47.976
The only reason I'm here is to ask
that you consider helping me,


613
00:50:47.978 --> 00:50:50.418
helping your daughter,
and then we'll be gone.


614
00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:56.012
The boys are still in the car.

615
00:50:56.519 --> 00:50:58.199
Han! Am I taking them or not?

616
00:51:11.634 --> 00:51:13.634
You know, you never believed
I was there for you.


617
00:51:14.604 --> 00:51:15.644
Even when we were little.

618
00:51:16.873 --> 00:51:18.073
Why would you be there for me?

619
00:51:19.075 --> 00:51:20.576
I slept with your husband.

620
00:51:20.578 --> 00:51:21.610
And he slept with you.

621
00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:28.750
You must feel so lonely.

622
00:51:37.026 --> 00:51:38.927
I just need help for a year

623
00:51:38.929 --> 00:51:42.170
or six months, and I can
even pay you interest.


624
00:51:45.168 --> 00:51:47.369
You won't even have to see us.

625
00:51:48.137 --> 00:51:51.537
You can move on and be the
same as you were before.


626
00:51:56.746 --> 00:51:57.613
Why do you do this?

627
00:52:01.217 --> 00:52:04.119
Why do you continually go into
things that will be a disaster?


628
00:52:08.124 --> 00:52:11.560
I've been trying to get you
to help me heal this family.


629
00:52:11.562 --> 00:52:14.630
And when you finally show up,
you just bring more pain.


630
00:52:20.003 --> 00:52:21.243
That's what I do.

631
00:52:25.943 --> 00:52:28.184
The parking lot's filling up.
We need to open now. Okay.


632
00:52:28.811 --> 00:52:29.878
Hey, you.

633
00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:37.198
I can't talk about this
anymore right now.


634
00:52:41.791 --> 00:52:44.826
I wish I had time. But I don't.

635
00:52:44.828 --> 00:52:45.894
We need time.

636
00:52:46.729 --> 00:52:48.030
This is a lot.

637
00:52:48.032 --> 00:52:49.097
Shh, it's okay.

638
00:52:51.935 --> 00:52:53.569
Aren't we going to practice?

639
00:52:53.571 --> 00:52:55.812
As soon as we open
the restaurant, sweetie.


640
00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:01.570
Please.

641
00:53:03.046 --> 00:53:04.112
We have kids too.

642
00:53:15.925 --> 00:53:17.925
I know you've always
been there for me.


643
00:53:19.796 --> 00:53:20.676
I know.

644
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:48.730
<i>We did sitting meditation too.</i>

645
00:54:50.119 --> 00:54:51.200
<i>But it wasn't as fun.</i>

646
00:54:53.723 --> 00:54:57.392
<i>Sometimes</i>
<i>if things got loud or...</i>


647
00:54:57.394 --> 00:54:59.714
<i>I couldn't go to my room</i>
<i>I would do the spinning.</i>


648
00:55:01.864 --> 00:55:03.298
<i>I felt energetic afterwards.</i>

649
00:55:04.934 --> 00:55:06.094
<i>Like I could do anything.</i>

650
00:55:10.406 --> 00:55:12.207
<i>I met a ton of fun people.</i>

651
00:55:13.142 --> 00:55:14.209
People.

652
00:55:16.212 --> 00:55:17.279
A boy?

653
00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:20.809
Both.

654
00:55:23.252 --> 00:55:24.452
But I miss Ginger.

655
00:55:26.989 --> 00:55:28.056
Jules?

656
00:55:29.425 --> 00:55:30.786
Do you remember
what I said about


657
00:55:31.894 --> 00:55:33.215
having to make a change
at work?


658
00:55:49.011 --> 00:55:50.971
It'll be hard for me
to take in oxygen at first,


659
00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:54.690
which will affect
the blood flow to my brain.


660
00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:59.121
You may have to
remind me of things.


661
00:56:01.157 --> 00:56:03.077
Especially
what's important to you.


662
00:56:06.963 --> 00:56:08.163
This is a big change.

663
00:56:10.833 --> 00:56:11.993
No one will recognize you.

664
00:56:13.536 --> 00:56:14.870
I'll have a special ID.

665
00:56:16.239 --> 00:56:18.520
And as more people
get the procedure done,


666
00:56:20.443 --> 00:56:22.684
it'll feel easier to explain.

667
00:56:26.082 --> 00:56:26.948
She's pretty.

668
00:56:31.954 --> 00:56:33.194
Don't you think so?

669
00:56:41.063 --> 00:56:43.023
Would you feel okay around her

670
00:56:43.499 --> 00:56:45.819
first thing in the morning?

671
00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:48.143
If you were sick?

672
00:56:49.238 --> 00:56:51.006
Imagine if she got frustrated

673
00:56:51.008 --> 00:56:52.208
or even mad.

674
00:56:53.176 --> 00:56:54.416
You keep saying "she."

675
00:56:56.245 --> 00:56:57.485
It's still you, right?

676
00:57:01.083 --> 00:57:03.963
I'm sorry. This whole thing
is kind of weird for me too.


677
00:57:54.871 --> 00:57:56.111
What is this?

678
00:58:05.414 --> 00:58:06.654
This is me?

679
00:58:17.093 --> 00:58:18.333
You're amazing.

680
00:58:20.463 --> 00:58:22.564
No, I'm not. Yes, you are.

681
00:58:29.438 --> 00:58:30.505
Listen to me.

682
00:58:32.441 --> 00:58:34.442
It's good to be humble,

683
00:58:34.444 --> 00:58:36.564
but you need
to know your value.


684
00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:40.181
The ideas, the wisdom,

685
00:58:41.584 --> 00:58:43.251
and the kindness in you.

686
00:58:43.253 --> 00:58:45.534
That's the secret
beauty everyone wants.


687
00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:54.396
Are you okay?

688
01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:01.723
Live emotionally.

689
01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:15.563
The Center's procedure

690
01:02:17.266 --> 01:02:19.434
provides a painless alternative

691
01:02:20.669 --> 01:02:23.471
to invasive cosmetic surgery.

692
01:02:25.307 --> 01:02:27.842
We move you into another
body and the lossless...


693
01:02:36.852 --> 01:02:38.753
The Center's procedure

694
01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:43.758
provides a painless alternative
to invasive cosmetic surgery.


695
01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:59.474
<i>The experience is akin to a seamless
jump into a brand new body,</i>


696
01:02:59.476 --> 01:03:04.546
circumventing the extensive recovery
period of invasive cosmetic surgery.


697
01:03:04.548 --> 01:03:08.283
I can attest to the seamlessness
of this experience,


698
01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:11.486
not only as the head of the Center
for Advanced Health and Living,


699
01:03:11.488 --> 01:03:14.556
but also a very
satisfied test subject.


700
01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:29.871
Okay. So who out there thinks
they have an imagination?


701
01:03:33.442 --> 01:03:34.676
Everyone?

702
01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:41.482
<i>Okay, everyone.</i>
<i>Close your eyes.</i>


703
01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:44.786
<i>Imagine a world where you were
diagnosed with a terminal illness,</i>


704
01:03:44.788 --> 01:03:47.789
<i>but you live to see your</i>
<i>great-grandkids go to college.</i>


705
01:03:50.693 --> 01:03:54.562
<i>Now let's imagine living

706
01:03:55.798 --> 01:03:58.766
<i>But on your 50th birthday,</i>

707
01:03:58.768 --> 01:04:00.728
<i>you're a professional</i>
<i>ballet dancer.</i>


708
01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:05.767
Now open your eyes.

709
01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:12.914
<i>You don't have to dream</i>
<i>up that world anymore.</i>


710
01:04:19.555 --> 01:04:20.788
That world is here,

711
01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:22.991
and it's yours.

712
01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:29.797
<i>New recorded hologram message.</i>

713
01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:34.335
<i>I was in shock.</i>

714
01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:37.805
<i>I hope you understand.</i>

715
01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:40.375
<i>The day you visited us</i>

716
01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:42.710
<i>reminded me how much</i>
<i>I hated who I used to be.</i>


717
01:04:45.614 --> 01:04:46.714
<i>We wanna help.</i>

718
01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:01.329
<i>I miss you.</i>

719
01:05:39.668 --> 01:05:40.668
Did you forget your shot?

720
01:05:43.539 --> 01:05:44.539
Yeah.

721
01:05:45.774 --> 01:05:47.014
I forgot my shot.

722
01:05:48.811 --> 01:05:49.877
Sorry.

723
01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:44.098
Don't come to meet me anymore.

724
01:06:45.667 --> 01:06:46.827
Not until you feel better.

725
01:06:48.604 --> 01:06:49.844
You think I'm an idiot.

726
01:06:51.974 --> 01:06:53.535
It doesn't matter
what I think of you.


727
01:07:40.088 --> 01:07:41.449
Did the operation
make you weird?


728
01:07:44.793 --> 01:07:47.595
You seem weird.

729
01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:49.797
<i>The majority of people who
are down on their luck</i>


730
01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:52.834
<i>are peaceful,</i>
<i>law-abiding citizens.</i>


731
01:07:52.836 --> 01:07:55.203
<i>But you know, there are</i>
<i>these people out there,</i>


732
01:07:55.205 --> 01:07:59.207
<i>that think the way to solve it
is violence and destruction,</i>


733
01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:00.508
<i>bombing and terror.</i>

734
01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:04.111
<i>Look at the success</i>
<i>of our city.</i>


735
01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:09.584
<i>New skyscrapers going up all
the time, bigger and better.</i>


736
01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:11.586
<i>These are</i>

737
01:08:11.588 --> 01:08:14.055
<i>majestic, gorgeous works of art</i>

738
01:08:14.057 --> 01:08:18.593
<i>designed by some of the top
internationally renowned architects.</i>


739
01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:23.030
<i>We live in a great, great city and we are
fortunate to be alive in these times.</i>


740
01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:42.116
<i>Don't get distracted.</i>

741
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:08.991
Can you turn that off?

742
01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.219
I thought you liked it.

743
01:09:12.981 --> 01:09:14.048
Not right now.

744
01:09:28.931 --> 01:09:30.197
Can you cheer up?

745
01:09:30.199 --> 01:09:32.900
What for?
How about for your mother?


746
01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:35.836
Because of me, you might actually get
somewhere instead of dreaming your life away.


747
01:09:35.838 --> 01:09:37.078
I'm not dreaming.

748
01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:39.861
I'm thinking.

749
01:09:47.849 --> 01:09:49.049
Where's my mother?

750
01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:54.140
Get back to work.
You're not her.


751
01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:01.195
Where is she?

752
01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:05.666
What happened?

753
01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:15.910
Get away.

754
01:10:38.867 --> 01:10:40.107
Well, you were right.

755
01:10:40.702 --> 01:10:41.942
About the pain not going away.

756
01:10:47.275 --> 01:10:48.315
I feel this anger...

757
01:10:52.247 --> 01:10:53.314
Like

758
01:10:57.019 --> 01:10:59.339
something is sitting next to
me screaming all the time.


759
01:11:04.192 --> 01:11:06.360
<i>It's what we're calling</i>
<i>mnemonic dissonance.</i>


760
01:11:06.362 --> 01:11:09.363
<i>It's your new body's instincts
clashing with your old memories.</i>


761
01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:10.798
<i>It might help you to</i>
<i>concentrate your thoughts</i>


762
01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.767
<i>on what's good</i>
<i>for your daughter.</i>


763
01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:15.169
For some reason I don't
want to focus on her.


764
01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:18.439
<i>Your animal connection with her
may not feel like it's there,</i>


765
01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:19.707
<i>but it will come back.</i>

766
01:11:21.243 --> 01:11:22.309
I think

767
01:11:27.683 --> 01:11:29.984
she and I need a break
from each other.


768
01:11:29.986 --> 01:11:31.986
<i>Jules needs your help with her
transition into prep school.</i>


769
01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:33.028
She hates me.

770
01:11:40.095 --> 01:11:42.296
She'll probably be relieved
to get away from me.


771
01:11:46.401 --> 01:11:47.561
But I don't mind.

772
01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:53.915
<i>Then what was the point</i>
<i>of any of this?</i>


773
01:11:55.911 --> 01:11:56.992
Do you remember this place?

774
01:11:58.380 --> 01:11:59.814
Yeah. We met here
before Christmas.


775
01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:01.056
Well, we didn't.

776
01:12:07.823 --> 01:12:09.156
Someone's got to straighten
out your priorities


777
01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:10.838
before you squander
everything for Jules.


778
01:12:20.435 --> 01:12:22.475
This might be a bigger
sacrifice than you imagine.


779
01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.774
Gwen, it's not like you're a
consciousness in a jar


780
01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:28.296
that we're dumping
into another jar.


781
01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:31.045
The technology is
not there yet.


782
01:12:31.047 --> 01:12:33.814
What do you mean? My marketing
characterizes the procedure.


783
01:12:33.816 --> 01:12:36.016
It's just that,
a consciousness transplant.


784
01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:37.151
That's marketing.

785
01:12:38.453 --> 01:12:40.221
What's the reality then?

786
01:12:40.223 --> 01:12:41.822
In order to reproduce
your memories,


787
01:12:41.824 --> 01:12:44.525
we have to plant
electrodes in your brain.


788
01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:47.361
And in the brain
of the new host.


789
01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:49.864
We use a semi-separable feedback
loop between the two of you,


790
01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:52.333
to generate a
psycho-physiological twin.


791
01:12:52.335 --> 01:12:54.135
New neurons, cloned matter.

792
01:12:54.836 --> 01:12:56.036
Wait.

793
01:12:57.005 --> 01:12:57.965
Twin?

794
01:12:59.908 --> 01:13:01.542
She'll be a copy of you.

795
01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:03.944
Same skills, same likes and
dislikes, same personality,


796
01:13:03.946 --> 01:13:06.347
but an entirely
separate awareness.


797
01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:10.351
So there'll be two of me then?

798
01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:17.424
Once the electrodes
are removed,


799
01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:19.927
the host brain can repair itself
because it's still young.


800
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:23.164
But your older brain can't.

801
01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.134
Your particular awareness
will cease to exist.


802
01:13:31.139 --> 01:13:32.506
You mean, I'm gonna die?

803
01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:48.389
Your cloned brain will wake up in the
new body with all your memories,


804
01:13:48.391 --> 01:13:51.425
and since she knows nothing
else, she'll believe she's you.


805
01:14:01.536 --> 01:14:04.405
But this is still Jules' only
chance, though, isn't it?


806
01:14:08.143 --> 01:14:09.023
Please don't do this.

807
01:14:10.011 --> 01:14:11.171
I want

808
01:14:12.147 --> 01:14:13.387
Christmas with her first.

809
01:14:20.021 --> 01:14:21.021
And, Dave,

810
01:14:24.426 --> 01:14:26.560
Jules can never know.

811
01:14:36.938 --> 01:14:38.818
Gwen needed you to perform
without misgivings.


812
01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:42.142
So I excluded this memory
from the transfer.


813
01:14:52.454 --> 01:14:55.289
She gave away her life
with her daughter.


814
01:14:55.291 --> 01:14:57.691
There's nothing inside of you
that knows what that meant.


815
01:15:00.595 --> 01:15:01.629
There's nothing left.

816
01:15:48.176 --> 01:15:49.476
Sales are through the roof.

817
01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:50.638
Was I someone else before?

818
01:15:53.248 --> 01:15:54.114
Body donor.

819
01:15:56.217 --> 01:15:59.418
Do you remember my last conversation
with Gwen in the holding room?


820
01:16:04.025 --> 01:16:08.095
Can you feel that part of her reaching
through you towards her little girl?


821
01:16:15.603 --> 01:16:16.803
That part is lost.

822
01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:24.311
Just inform me if you need
any additional changes.


823
01:17:15.296 --> 01:17:16.630
Did you kill her?

824
01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:21.268
She did this.

825
01:17:27.509 --> 01:17:29.143
She's gone, Jules.

826
01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:29.645
I'm sorry.

827
01:17:33.615 --> 01:17:34.855
I don't believe you.

828
01:17:38.787 --> 01:17:40.027
She wouldn't do that.

829
01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:11.518
I can't seem to find my...

830
01:18:13.688 --> 01:18:14.688
Medicine.

831
01:18:21.296 --> 01:18:23.197
I'm not gonna be here
for anyone else.


832
01:18:29.637 --> 01:18:32.172
I'm not gonna be here
for any other reason.


833
01:20:51.346 --> 01:20:52.012
What's wrong?

834
01:20:55.984 --> 01:20:58.265
I don't really know
why I'm alive.


835
01:21:05.693 --> 01:21:06.560
Doesn't matter.

836
01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:10.463
Whatever you do will be
wonderful and worthwhile.


837
01:21:12.734 --> 01:21:13.894
How do you know?

838
01:21:16.537 --> 01:21:17.737
I know because you're kind.

839
01:21:23.344 --> 01:21:25.545
People say being kind
is being weak.


840
01:21:31.619 --> 01:21:32.859
You're alive because of energy

841
01:21:34.489 --> 01:21:35.555
and empathy.

842
01:21:38.026 --> 01:21:40.866
Your mother had so much of it inside
of her, she needed to get it out.


843
01:21:42.063 --> 01:21:43.397
So she made you.

844
01:21:44.766 --> 01:21:47.047
You're starting to
sound like her.


845
01:23:25.967 --> 01:23:27.167
I'm sweating.

846
01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:28.034
I hate sweating.

847
01:23:29.837 --> 01:23:30.937
Are they late?

848
01:23:30.939 --> 01:23:33.707
Relax.

849
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:35.829
Let's do the meditation thing
you learned at camp.


850
01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:37.771
That was fun.
