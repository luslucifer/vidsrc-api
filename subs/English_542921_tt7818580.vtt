1
00:01:04.173 --> 00:01:09.247
While at war

2
00:01:45.507 --> 00:01:47.418
Present... arms!

3
00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:52.296
Attention!

4
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.000
Today,

5
00:01:55.507 --> 00:01:59.580
the 19th of July, 1936,

6
00:01:59.882 --> 00:02:03.830
a state of war is declared
in salamanca,


7
00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:06.668
and with god's help,

8
00:02:07.173 --> 00:02:09.380
in all of Spain!

9
00:02:10.423 --> 00:02:12.630
Article one!

10
00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:19.712
Gatherings of more than three people
in public are forbidden!


11
00:02:19.882 --> 00:02:21.964
Those who disobey

12
00:02:22.423 --> 00:02:26.166
will be immediately dispersed
by force!


13
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.456
- Article two!
- It's about time, soldiers!


14
00:02:28.632 --> 00:02:31.920
- Traitors! Sons of bitches!
- Long live Spain!


15
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.955
- Long live the Republic!
- Long live Spain!


16
00:02:34.798 --> 00:02:36.538
In the next twelve hours,

17
00:02:36.757 --> 00:02:40.204
anyone in possession
of short and long firearms


18
00:02:40.382 --> 00:02:42.122
and explosive substances

19
00:02:42.298 --> 00:02:46.086
must surrender them
at the civil guard station


20
00:02:46.173 --> 00:02:47.333
nearest to their domicile!

21
00:02:47.507 --> 00:02:51.750
- Long live the social revolution!
- Long live the Republic! Fascists!


22
00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:55.037
After that time, anyone with firearms

23
00:02:55.215 --> 00:02:58.287
will be considered a rebel!

24
00:02:58.923 --> 00:03:01.164
Article four!

25
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.878
It is strictly forbidden to approach

26
00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:09.337
electrical energy lines
without a legitimate reason!


27
00:03:09.965 --> 00:03:12.206
Article five!

28
00:03:43.215 --> 00:03:45.456
Casto prieto, you're under arrest.

29
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.582
What are you accusing
my husband of?


30
00:03:59.757 --> 00:04:00.792
Shut up, ma'am!

31
00:04:00.965 --> 00:04:02.796
You're kidnapping
the mayor of salamanca!


32
00:04:02.965 --> 00:04:04.921
Calm down, ma'am. Scoundrels!

33
00:04:05.507 --> 00:04:06.622
Scoundrels!

34
00:04:24.923 --> 00:04:26.254
Grandpa!

35
00:04:29.923 --> 00:04:31.288
Grandpa!

36
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.876
My aunts said to tell you.

37
00:04:43.507 --> 00:04:44.713
Tell me what?

38
00:04:45.923 --> 00:04:49.791
Who wish to support the glorious
uprising to save our fatherland,


39
00:04:49.965 --> 00:04:53.662
donor contributions
will be opened tomorrow.


40
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.003
Any effort is little
in such decisive moments.


41
00:04:57.257 --> 00:05:00.954
We continue with
the following announcement...


42
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.297
Dad, where are you going?
Can't you hear the gunfire?


43
00:05:06.465 --> 00:05:07.955
Dad, please.

44
00:05:08.132 --> 00:05:09.497
Where is my txapela?

45
00:05:13.715 --> 00:05:15.797
My txapela.

46
00:05:18.132 --> 00:05:19.668
Here.

47
00:05:23.132 --> 00:05:24.963
If you're going out,
I'm going with you.


48
00:05:25.465 --> 00:05:27.296
No, my girl. You're staying here.

49
00:05:29.173 --> 00:05:31.789
Lock the door.
Don't open it for anyone.


50
00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:41.632
Grandpa!

51
00:05:43.382 --> 00:05:44.997
Miguelin, go back inside!

52
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.421
Good afternoon.

53
00:06:07.132 --> 00:06:08.713
That's him! Did you see him?
Who?


54
00:06:08.882 --> 00:06:11.043
- Miguel de unamuno.
- Yeah, the writer.


55
00:06:21.382 --> 00:06:22.382
Good afternoon.

56
00:06:22.423 --> 00:06:25.540
- Have you heard?
- Yes, yes, get your husband.


57
00:06:27.173 --> 00:06:29.414
I'm coming, Don Miguel, I'm coming!

58
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.171
Atilano, please, be careful!

59
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.831
Of course, we will, enriqueta.

60
00:06:55.465 --> 00:06:57.171
Go out today?

61
00:06:57.257 --> 00:06:58.463
Today is madness.

62
00:06:58.632 --> 00:07:01.544
Then don't come.
Come on, atilano, I'm losing my pace.


63
00:07:10.548 --> 00:07:12.539
Wait for me!

64
00:07:17.215 --> 00:07:18.250
There.

65
00:07:19.048 --> 00:07:21.084
And the other one went down
over there.


66
00:07:21.173 --> 00:07:23.505
I don't see any blood, Salvador.

67
00:07:23.673 --> 00:07:26.460
- Atilano, for god's sake.
- Don't blaspheme.


68
00:07:26.632 --> 00:07:28.588
Five dead. Five!

69
00:07:28.757 --> 00:07:30.338
And the other side didn't shoot?

70
00:07:30.507 --> 00:07:33.670
Sure, the communists and syndicalists
never do anything.


71
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.171
Don't start with that, please.

72
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.002
They're the ones who burn
churches and convents, Salvador,


73
00:07:38.173 --> 00:07:39.913
I'm not making this up.

74
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.921
How would you know?
You're not even catholic.


75
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.378
Yes, I'm a protestant, but here,
in Spain,


76
00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:48.745
people are attacking faith in Christ.
Just like in Russia.


77
00:07:48.923 --> 00:07:50.914
Am I right, Don Miguel?

78
00:07:53.382 --> 00:07:56.749
I'd rather save my tongue
for the press.


79
00:07:56.923 --> 00:07:58.959
I have an interview in half an hour.

80
00:07:59.965 --> 00:08:01.330
Anyway...

81
00:08:03.007 --> 00:08:05.840
You're leaving already?
Why did you bring us here?


82
00:08:06.007 --> 00:08:07.793
For a cup of coffee
like every afternoon.


83
00:08:07.965 --> 00:08:10.047
And you're not going to say anything?

84
00:08:15.007 --> 00:08:16.167
About what?

85
00:08:16.757 --> 00:08:18.622
Miguel, they're attacking the Republic.

86
00:08:19.048 --> 00:08:20.379
Salvador, my boy,

87
00:08:20.465 --> 00:08:22.296
how long have we known each other?

88
00:08:24.798 --> 00:08:27.710
Do you really want me
to talk to you about the Republic?


89
00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.213
That's for mine.

90
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.000
And a donkey.

91
00:08:40.132 --> 00:08:42.464
University of salamanca

92
00:08:42.632 --> 00:08:44.497
and that's why I ended up
in fuerteventura.


93
00:08:44.673 --> 00:08:46.880
In exile. For trying to change things.

94
00:08:46.965 --> 00:08:50.708
And when they finally changed,
when we finally got rid of the king


95
00:08:50.882 --> 00:08:54.124
and the Republic we had so
longed for arrived...


96
00:08:54.215 --> 00:08:57.207
No order, no peace, no bread,
nothing.


97
00:08:57.382 --> 00:09:00.579
And that law they passed
for autonomy in catalonia,


98
00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:04.416
which I myself voted for,
but not to break Spain apart...


99
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.920
Go ahead.

100
00:09:06.507 --> 00:09:09.920
No. No, no!
Absolutely not! No, sir!


101
00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.206
I haven't betrayed the Republic.

102
00:09:12.382 --> 00:09:14.623
The Republic betrayed me.

103
00:09:14.798 --> 00:09:17.790
And, paradoxically, 
I still love it.

104
00:09:17.965 --> 00:09:19.956
That's why this is necessary.

105
00:09:20.132 --> 00:09:22.794
- To restore order.
- You can't go in there!


106
00:09:22.882 --> 00:09:23.962
Dean, sir!

107
00:09:24.132 --> 00:09:25.963
Anyway, I have to hang up now.

108
00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:29.169
And write everything correctly,
you journalists destroy


109
00:09:29.257 --> 00:09:31.213
the Spanish language.
I have spoken. Goodbye.


110
00:09:31.382 --> 00:09:33.122
They took him away, Don Miguel.

111
00:09:33.215 --> 00:09:37.754
No charges, no explanation, only because
he's the mayor and a socialist.


112
00:09:43.007 --> 00:09:45.749
And how many times did I say
something like this could happen?


113
00:09:46.257 --> 00:09:48.623
To all of you, didn't I warn you?

114
00:09:49.048 --> 00:09:50.959
What we have to do now
is cooperate.


115
00:09:52.465 --> 00:09:54.080
Cooperate with who?

116
00:09:55.007 --> 00:09:56.417
With the uprising?

117
00:09:57.423 --> 00:09:59.664
Over my dead body. No, sir.

118
00:09:59.757 --> 00:10:01.338
Death...

119
00:10:01.507 --> 00:10:04.874
A whole country willing to die
for political ideas.


120
00:10:06.632 --> 00:10:08.042
Look who's talking!

121
00:10:08.632 --> 00:10:11.874
You were never one
to keep yours quiet.


122
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.753
Look, Ana. There's really nothing
I can do in this matter.


123
00:10:18.423 --> 00:10:20.914
Well, I can help you with
a little money...


124
00:10:23.465 --> 00:10:26.377
- Money?
- While casto is in prison.


125
00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:34.918
You mean if they don't kill him first.

126
00:10:35.298 --> 00:10:37.004
You'd feel differently

127
00:10:38.548 --> 00:10:40.459
if they took someone
from your family.


128
00:10:40.632 --> 00:10:43.874
- Ma'am, please!
- Then you'd know how it feels!


129
00:10:45.382 --> 00:10:47.998
But... how atrocious.

130
00:10:48.215 --> 00:10:50.251
That's how Spain works, ramos.

131
00:11:16.298 --> 00:11:20.997
Spanish protectorate in Morocco

132
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.877
Twenty junkers crossing Gibraltar,
day and night.


133
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.421
An airlift for your troops.

134
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.080
Long live Hitler!

135
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:38.796
It's never been done before.

136
00:11:38.965 --> 00:11:41.172
That way we can help our brothers

137
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.377
who have risen up to save
the Republic from communism.


138
00:11:44.798 --> 00:11:47.380
Please relay our enormous gratitude
to Berlin.


139
00:11:51.257 --> 00:11:53.168
Bring lemonade
for the German gentlemen.


140
00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.340
Yes, general.

141
00:11:58.298 --> 00:12:02.291
The fiihrer is concerned about
the death of general hansurch... San...


142
00:12:02.382 --> 00:12:03.838
Sanjurjo.

143
00:12:07.798 --> 00:12:11.290
And he wants you to name
a new leader as soon as possible.


144
00:12:16.465 --> 00:12:19.628
From now on leadership
will be exercised by a military junta


145
00:12:19.715 --> 00:12:23.162
in burgos. Decisions will be made
by consensus.


146
00:12:39.507 --> 00:12:43.921
You cannot win without a leader.
The fiihrer might withdraw


147
00:12:44.007 --> 00:12:45.338
his support.

148
00:12:49.923 --> 00:12:52.710
That look in his eye again,
like he doesn't understand.


149
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.672
Sometimes I think he's mocking us.

150
00:13:03.298 --> 00:13:06.540
We have to keep squeezing
these Germans.


151
00:13:07.382 --> 00:13:08.792
Like lemons.

152
00:13:09.007 --> 00:13:10.747
And what they said about a leader?

153
00:13:11.132 --> 00:13:13.669
They could cut us off, general.

154
00:13:15.423 --> 00:13:18.256
Paco. You have to step forward now.

155
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.340
No.

156
00:13:23.923 --> 00:13:27.211
Let's go! Two lines from right to left!

157
00:15:11.715 --> 00:15:16.630
"Sole article: The article passed on
September 30th of 1934 is hereby revoked.


158
00:15:17.423 --> 00:15:21.837
Don Miguel de unamuno is therefore dismissed as
lifelong Dean of the university of salamanca


159
00:15:22.007 --> 00:15:24.794
and likewise relieved
of all other related duties."


160
00:15:24.965 --> 00:15:27.047
- Would you put that newspaper away?
- Why?


161
00:15:27.215 --> 00:15:30.287
- It's from Madrid, you idiot.
- And it's signed by Manuel azana.


162
00:15:31.132 --> 00:15:32.542
It looks like you're out of a job.

163
00:15:32.757 --> 00:15:35.999
- Badly written, like all his writings.
- And the drawing?


164
00:15:45.507 --> 00:15:47.498
Look, grandpa, it's badly written!

165
00:15:47.673 --> 00:15:49.629
Pay him not mind, he's senile

166
00:15:51.423 --> 00:15:54.005
they're attacking me.
The reds are attacking me.


167
00:15:54.173 --> 00:15:55.959
You know why, right?

168
00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.001
Because of the five thousand pesetas.

169
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.920
My girl...

170
00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.296
I made that donation to soldiers.

171
00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:07.088
To fascists, dad. Fascists.

172
00:16:07.173 --> 00:16:09.664
And you gave them
what you make in six months.


173
00:16:10.215 --> 00:16:13.753
Soldiers doing their duty
for the Republic.


174
00:16:13.923 --> 00:16:16.630
If people in this house
ever read my articles...


175
00:16:18.423 --> 00:16:21.335
- I read them.
- Shut up and eat.


176
00:16:24.215 --> 00:16:25.815
When you reach my age,
you'll understand.


177
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.422
Right, it must be a matter
of age then...


178
00:17:19.132 --> 00:17:20.872
- Who?
- Casto.


179
00:17:21.048 --> 00:17:24.040
Our mayor? But he was arrested, Salvador.
Arrested.


180
00:17:24.215 --> 00:17:26.171
Lying in a ditch, shot in the head.

181
00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.626
The milkman saw him
on his way to valladolid.


182
00:17:30.632 --> 00:17:33.419
Why should we believe
what a milkman says?


183
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:37.583
Here we go again, atilano. What about
the gunfire we heard this morning?


184
00:17:37.798 --> 00:17:39.334
People are getting killed here.

185
00:17:39.507 --> 00:17:41.247
Poachers.

186
00:17:42.423 --> 00:17:44.038
Do you really believe that?

187
00:17:44.382 --> 00:17:47.545
All that really matters, gentlemen,
is that nobody here


188
00:17:47.632 --> 00:17:50.874
has abolished the Republic.
I have spoken.


189
00:17:55.298 --> 00:17:57.058
Your coffee, your paper figures,
all is well.


190
00:17:57.215 --> 00:17:58.546
Salvador...

191
00:17:58.757 --> 00:18:01.544
- You've really changed, Miguel.
- What do you mean?


192
00:18:02.757 --> 00:18:04.622
Look, son, I haven't changed.

193
00:18:04.798 --> 00:18:07.631
When have I ever stayed quiet
about something?


194
00:18:08.132 --> 00:18:12.125
Well, lately you've gone mute. Mute and
asleep, you don't even skip a siesta.


195
00:18:12.298 --> 00:18:14.334
Hey, Salvador, bite your tongue.

196
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.840
Hear this.

197
00:18:17.673 --> 00:18:20.631
Even asleep I'm more awake
than the rest of you.


198
00:18:20.798 --> 00:18:23.995
Why don't you flee to the red zone,
with Don Manuel azana?


199
00:18:24.173 --> 00:18:26.084
And since he fired me,
tell him...


200
00:18:26.173 --> 00:18:27.413
So that's what's eating you.

201
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.546
Gentlemen... tell him...

202
00:18:29.757 --> 00:18:32.214
To fire himself, for the good of Spain.

203
00:18:32.507 --> 00:18:35.089
- Or even better, to kill himself.
- No. No.


204
00:18:35.298 --> 00:18:37.835
- You can't say that.
- Like balmaceda did in Chile.


205
00:18:37.923 --> 00:18:38.628
Why not? Sure, I can.

206
00:18:38.798 --> 00:18:40.663
You're a Christian.
Not that, Don Miguel...


207
00:18:40.882 --> 00:18:43.589
I'm "unamunian”
and I can say anything I please.


208
00:18:43.798 --> 00:18:46.631
Well, as a Christian,
I can't give you my consent.


209
00:18:47.548 --> 00:18:49.584
If you're so offended
by what we say here,


210
00:18:49.673 --> 00:18:51.504
you should stay in your church.

211
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.125
Enough already.

212
00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:56.332
I've been wanting to say this
for a long time.


213
00:18:56.798 --> 00:19:00.586
You know what you are?
A puritan. That's right.


214
00:19:00.965 --> 00:19:02.921
A puritan.

215
00:19:08.882 --> 00:19:11.043
No, atilano...

216
00:19:13.132 --> 00:19:15.373
You could have kept
that last part to yourself.


217
00:19:15.548 --> 00:19:19.245
I just said I never keep quiet,
neither does he, and you even less so.


218
00:19:19.798 --> 00:19:24.246
Quite a threesome we've gathered. We should
be on the front shooting each other.


219
00:19:33.507 --> 00:19:34.997
Poachers, huh?

220
00:19:41.882 --> 00:19:44.624
School of the Evangelical church

221
00:19:58.465 --> 00:20:01.832
- Good afternoon, enriqueta.
- Good afternoon.


222
00:20:02.423 --> 00:20:04.755
- Is atilano here?
- Wasn't he with you?


223
00:20:04.923 --> 00:20:07.084
- Well, yes...
- He's probably at home, I'll call him.


224
00:20:07.257 --> 00:20:09.213
No, no. There's no need.

225
00:20:12.632 --> 00:20:15.339
That I'll see him at the novelty
tomorrow, like always.


226
00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:18.624
Of course, don't worry.
But did you want something?


227
00:20:18.882 --> 00:20:21.168
No, no, nothing.

228
00:20:21.257 --> 00:20:22.497
That's all.

229
00:20:22.757 --> 00:20:25.294
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.


230
00:20:31.798 --> 00:20:33.914
Asleep, he says...

231
00:21:00.548 --> 00:21:01.879
Me, asleep...

232
00:21:30.382 --> 00:21:31.497
Slackers!

233
00:21:32.007 --> 00:21:33.417
Troublemakers!

234
00:21:34.007 --> 00:21:35.372
Delinquents!

235
00:21:35.548 --> 00:21:38.915
That's what they called you!
Living dead!


236
00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:40.838
But I didn't ask,

237
00:21:41.007 --> 00:21:43.419
I took you in with open arms!

238
00:21:43.798 --> 00:21:46.540
Well, with the one arm I have left!

239
00:21:47.298 --> 00:21:49.960
I offered you a chance.

240
00:21:50.382 --> 00:21:53.294
A new life, as gentlemen!

241
00:21:53.382 --> 00:21:56.419
That's why you have to die
once again if necessary.


242
00:21:56.923 --> 00:22:00.120
Gentlemen legionnaires!
Long live death!!


243
00:22:00.298 --> 00:22:02.459
Long live death!

244
00:22:02.632 --> 00:22:03.963
Long live millan astray!

245
00:22:04.465 --> 00:22:06.126
They love me like a father.

246
00:22:06.632 --> 00:22:09.294
What's more, they love me
and so do


247
00:22:09.382 --> 00:22:11.247
the reds. Everybody loves me!

248
00:22:11.423 --> 00:22:13.664
Even the catalans love me!

249
00:22:15.673 --> 00:22:17.004
Boys!

250
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:19.877
Go out there and die in combat.
There's no greater honor.


251
00:22:20.507 --> 00:22:22.213
And die singing.

252
00:22:25.882 --> 00:22:30.330
I'm a man who fate...

253
00:22:31.298 --> 00:22:33.960
Clawed at

254
00:22:34.048 --> 00:22:36.289
like a beast.

255
00:22:36.632 --> 00:22:42.548
Death be my bride
as I tie myself tightly


256
00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.755
to loyal company.

257
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:54.335
When the going got tough
and the fight got rough,


258
00:22:54.507 --> 00:22:59.456
defending their flag,
the legion never stopped...


259
00:23:04.465 --> 00:23:07.207
Franco's general headquarters
caceres


260
00:23:07.673 --> 00:23:10.380
long live the glorious cripple!

261
00:23:10.632 --> 00:23:12.497
That's me!

262
00:23:19.507 --> 00:23:20.963
Pepe...

263
00:23:21.507 --> 00:23:23.998
Pepe, you're not crying, are you?

264
00:23:28.048 --> 00:23:29.208
Here.

265
00:23:30.215 --> 00:23:31.671
Was Argentina good to you?

266
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.580
Paco, I...

267
00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.751
I heard like a voice

268
00:23:38.007 --> 00:23:40.794
telling me: My legion!

269
00:23:41.465 --> 00:23:42.796
And I knew it was you.

270
00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.546
And here I am,

271
00:23:45.132 --> 00:23:47.794
ready to get back to work.

272
00:23:50.215 --> 00:23:52.080
Where are Carmen and your daughter?

273
00:23:53.673 --> 00:23:56.380
Not even my brother has
that information right now.


274
00:23:56.548 --> 00:23:58.004
Say no more.

275
00:23:58.923 --> 00:24:00.754
We're advancing 25 kilometers a day.

276
00:24:00.923 --> 00:24:02.163
Wait.

277
00:24:02.965 --> 00:24:05.331
I see better this way.

278
00:24:06.632 --> 00:24:07.792
Seville...

279
00:24:08.298 --> 00:24:10.630
Mérida... badajoz...

280
00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.126
Paco, you had to come back
from Africa


281
00:24:13.298 --> 00:24:15.254
to save all of their asses.

282
00:24:15.423 --> 00:24:17.288
Because that junta in burgos...

283
00:24:17.465 --> 00:24:20.787
- Don't say that.
- Yes, you're way too modest.


284
00:24:21.257 --> 00:24:23.498
Tell me, paco.
What do you want me to do?


285
00:24:23.673 --> 00:24:26.005
Look... blood is getting spilled here.

286
00:24:26.173 --> 00:24:28.710
But, as you well know,
we need the smell to reach...


287
00:24:29.673 --> 00:24:30.788
Here.

288
00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:32.375
The propaganda...

289
00:24:32.965 --> 00:24:33.965
You can leave to me.

290
00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:37.537
And before you know it, we take Madrid.
The reds will be in check, end of story.


291
00:24:39.382 --> 00:24:40.542
Well?

292
00:24:41.923 --> 00:24:43.333
You want to see it, huh?

293
00:24:45.007 --> 00:24:48.124
- I'm sorry, general, sir.
- No, it's okay.


294
00:24:50.465 --> 00:24:52.456
Have a look.

295
00:24:52.965 --> 00:24:54.296
Take your time.

296
00:24:55.798 --> 00:24:57.254
Come closer, come closer...

297
00:24:58.215 --> 00:25:00.877
That's it. Come closer.

298
00:25:01.382 --> 00:25:04.169
Look closely. Look closely.

299
00:25:11.465 --> 00:25:13.080
Go on, back to work.

300
00:25:18.798 --> 00:25:20.459
"Don Miguel de unamuno

301
00:25:20.632 --> 00:25:23.044
is one of the most respected
men of wisdom in Spain


302
00:25:23.132 --> 00:25:24.838
and the entire world.

303
00:25:26.298 --> 00:25:30.120
His prestigious literary
and philosophical works are widely known


304
00:25:30.298 --> 00:25:31.788
and that is why

305
00:25:31.882 --> 00:25:35.830
we are proud of his fervent support
for our sacred struggle.


306
00:25:36.007 --> 00:25:38.373
Rebel military junta burgos

307
00:25:38.548 --> 00:25:39.708
therefore,

308
00:25:39.798 --> 00:25:43.290
before the pettiness of those who
take away what was granted not by them,


309
00:25:43.465 --> 00:25:45.581
but by god,

310
00:25:45.673 --> 00:25:49.791
as President of the national
defense committee, I hereby decree:


311
00:25:49.882 --> 00:25:53.249
Sole article: Don Miguel de unamuno
is reinstated


312
00:25:53.423 --> 00:25:56.711
as lifelong Dean
of the university of salamanca."


313
00:26:14.132 --> 00:26:15.588
Nobody touched anything.

314
00:26:15.757 --> 00:26:17.668
We knew it would only last
a few days.


315
00:26:18.382 --> 00:26:19.792
Me too.

316
00:26:23.507 --> 00:26:24.542
What are these?

317
00:26:25.798 --> 00:26:27.504
Those are the reports.

318
00:26:28.423 --> 00:26:29.788
What reports?

319
00:26:30.423 --> 00:26:32.960
- They didn't tell you?
- No.


320
00:26:33.215 --> 00:26:35.581
As Dean, you are now president

321
00:26:35.673 --> 00:26:37.755
of the regional purging committee.

322
00:26:38.215 --> 00:26:42.458
What nonsense. I'm not a judge, much less
a prosecutor. Who am I going to purge?


323
00:26:42.632 --> 00:26:45.419
Then you don't know about
the manifesto either.


324
00:26:45.965 --> 00:26:47.671
For universities around the world.

325
00:26:47.882 --> 00:26:50.999
You'd only have to write a few words
supporting the uprising...


326
00:26:51.173 --> 00:26:54.961
Propaganda is for the military,
this is a teaching institution.


327
00:26:55.173 --> 00:26:56.253
Right.

328
00:26:56.423 --> 00:27:00.541
Actually general millan astray
is handling propaganda now.


329
00:27:01.798 --> 00:27:05.211
Who? That cripple who howls
more than Mussolini?


330
00:27:05.382 --> 00:27:07.168
I'm taking orders from him?

331
00:27:08.465 --> 00:27:10.126
They can exile me again.

332
00:27:10.215 --> 00:27:11.921
I stood up to the king,
I can handle them.


333
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:15.457
You'd only have to sign.
I can write it myself.


334
00:27:16.298 --> 00:27:21.213
Look, ramos. Do as you please, but I refuse
to go down in history as a Judas.


335
00:27:21.882 --> 00:27:24.089
Get these papers off my desk.

336
00:27:38.465 --> 00:27:40.126
Don Miguel!

337
00:27:40.548 --> 00:27:42.254
Please, come in.

338
00:27:47.507 --> 00:27:49.168
Good afternoon.

339
00:27:49.923 --> 00:27:52.505
Has anything happened to your husband?

340
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.251
He hasn't come to the novelty...

341
00:27:54.423 --> 00:27:57.495
On Tuesday, when you came
to the church, he didn't come home.


342
00:27:57.673 --> 00:28:01.541
That night I went to the civil guard and they
said they had to ask him some questions.


343
00:28:01.632 --> 00:28:02.712
Atilano?

344
00:28:02.965 --> 00:28:07.163
But that was three days ago!
Why didn't you say anything to me?


345
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:10.206
Don Miguel, they'll let him go.
Surely they'll realize.


346
00:28:10.382 --> 00:28:11.872
Realize what?

347
00:28:12.048 --> 00:28:14.755
Well, that they've made a mistake.

348
00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.955
Won't they?

349
00:28:18.423 --> 00:28:19.788
What did you want to tell him?

350
00:28:21.673 --> 00:28:22.708
What?

351
00:28:23.298 --> 00:28:26.131
When you came over.
There was a reason, wasn't there?


352
00:28:26.632 --> 00:28:28.372
Something you knew and...

353
00:28:28.548 --> 00:28:31.665
No, nothing. Something silly.

354
00:28:32.548 --> 00:28:33.833
Things of ours.

355
00:28:35.048 --> 00:28:36.413
Things of ours.

356
00:28:41.007 --> 00:28:44.795
Could it be because he was involved
in politics back in the day?


357
00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:48.162
We've all been involved in politics,
you more than anyone.


358
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.958
I don't know. He might have done
something stupid. Something crazy.


359
00:28:53.132 --> 00:28:56.204
Now let's take Madrid and Barcelona!
Jarriba espana!


360
00:28:56.382 --> 00:28:58.213
Jarriba espana!

361
00:28:59.007 --> 00:29:02.545
Atilano? Something crazy?
He wouldn't hurt a fly.


362
00:29:02.715 --> 00:29:05.787
We have to go to city hall.
Even better, the central government.


363
00:29:05.965 --> 00:29:07.626
And demand an explanation.

364
00:29:07.798 --> 00:29:09.318
You really think they'll give you one?

365
00:29:09.465 --> 00:29:10.875
Me? Of course.

366
00:29:11.048 --> 00:29:13.505
Why, because you're Miguel de unamuno?

367
00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.922
No, no. Those are rumors spread
by the other side.


368
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:21.787
Miguel, come back to earth already.

369
00:29:21.965 --> 00:29:24.707
They dragged Garcia lorca
out of his house and shot him!


370
00:29:25.298 --> 00:29:27.414
They said so on the BBC.

371
00:29:30.757 --> 00:29:32.998
- On the BBC?
- Yes.


372
00:29:33.173 --> 00:29:36.040
Haven't you figured it out yet?
This isn't a return to order.


373
00:29:36.965 --> 00:29:40.503
This is fascism, just like in Italy
and Germany!


374
00:29:44.965 --> 00:29:46.205
Let's go.

375
00:29:46.298 --> 00:29:47.458
Where?

376
00:29:48.882 --> 00:29:50.372
To the university.

377
00:30:03.007 --> 00:30:04.213
One second!

378
00:30:08.007 --> 00:30:09.247
Are you Miguel de unamuno?

379
00:30:09.798 --> 00:30:11.254
Yes, why?

380
00:30:11.673 --> 00:30:13.413
The real unamuno?

381
00:30:13.507 --> 00:30:15.418
Yes, what's the problem?

382
00:30:20.715 --> 00:30:23.752
What did I tell you? Sir, it's an honor.
Can I have your autograph?


383
00:30:24.132 --> 00:30:25.463
Yes.

384
00:30:25.965 --> 00:30:29.287
- Salvador, please.
- For gregorio aparicio, if you don't mind.


385
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.457
- What for, you can't even read!
- Shut up!


386
00:30:32.632 --> 00:30:34.372
Sir, you're very famous, aren't you?

387
00:30:34.548 --> 00:30:36.004
And this year

388
00:30:36.257 --> 00:30:39.044
- you almost got a nobel prize for writing.
- Here you are.


389
00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:43.708
Thank you very much, sir.
You make everyone proud.


390
00:30:44.257 --> 00:30:45.793
Jarriba espana!

391
00:30:50.715 --> 00:30:53.422
Ramos, where did I put them?
They're not in my office.


392
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:56.627
- What?
- The committee reports.


393
00:30:57.132 --> 00:30:59.669
But... you said that...

394
00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:05.297
Dean, sir, you're a mystery to me.

395
00:31:05.465 --> 00:31:06.955
My habit used to say that.

396
00:31:07.132 --> 00:31:10.169
- Who?
- My wife. Come on, come on.


397
00:31:12.798 --> 00:31:14.083
This can't be.

398
00:31:14.257 --> 00:31:15.463
What?

399
00:31:15.798 --> 00:31:18.631
Alfredo velarde.
This boy was a student of mine.


400
00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.831
Arrested for joining the union.

401
00:31:21.007 --> 00:31:22.417
Look at this one.

402
00:31:23.257 --> 00:31:25.293
Arrested for not going to mass.

403
00:31:27.382 --> 00:31:28.502
If they caught you and me...

404
00:31:28.632 --> 00:31:29.997
Here it is.

405
00:31:30.882 --> 00:31:32.292
Atilano coco.

406
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:44.831
Yes, but what's wrong with that?

407
00:31:45.007 --> 00:31:47.874
It was in england,
when he was ordained a pastor.


408
00:31:48.048 --> 00:31:49.608
It's normal there,
even the king is one.


409
00:31:49.757 --> 00:31:51.293
It's almost curfew. 
We have to go.

410
00:31:51.465 --> 00:31:56.289
And I think a lot of generals here are too.
Don Miguel, now I really don't understand.


411
00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.376
Dad, there's nothing you can do.

412
00:32:03.798 --> 00:32:06.039
If atilano is a Mason,
that's his own fault, right?


413
00:32:06.215 --> 00:32:07.955
Felisa, do you even know
what masonry is?


414
00:32:08.132 --> 00:32:09.732
No and I don't care.
Surely nothing good.


415
00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.330
It's no reason to arrest someone.

416
00:32:11.507 --> 00:32:13.498
Then why did they do it, Maria?
Tell me.


417
00:32:13.673 --> 00:32:15.584
It's the conspiracy myth.

418
00:32:16.423 --> 00:32:18.835
Since the Jews don't have
their own country,


419
00:32:19.507 --> 00:32:21.043
they want revenge.

420
00:32:21.382 --> 00:32:24.374
That's why they conspire
to destroy nations.


421
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:29.539
Their allies would be the masons
and the communists.


422
00:32:30.548 --> 00:32:33.870
"A judeo-masonic-marxist conspiracy."

423
00:32:37.507 --> 00:32:39.418
But who would believe all that?

424
00:32:42.715 --> 00:32:44.046
Swine!

425
00:32:44.882 --> 00:32:46.292
Scoundrels!

426
00:32:46.548 --> 00:32:49.290
Infamy! It's infamy!

427
00:32:50.798 --> 00:32:52.880
Are we going to stand here

428
00:32:53.048 --> 00:32:55.881
watching the enemy's garbage
with our arms crossed?


429
00:32:56.298 --> 00:32:59.370
Excuse me, general, sir.
Your wife and daughter have arrived.


430
00:32:59.882 --> 00:33:02.168
For god's sake!
We can't allow this!


431
00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.296
- Tell them to wait.
- Yes, sir.


432
00:33:05.048 --> 00:33:07.755
We need to go there
and stand up to them!


433
00:33:07.923 --> 00:33:10.005
Long live the alcazar of Toledo, damn it!

434
00:33:10.173 --> 00:33:14.337
We can't intervene. It would delay
our entry into Madrid.


435
00:33:14.632 --> 00:33:16.418
Only a few days!

436
00:33:16.507 --> 00:33:20.170
Long enough for Russia to help the reds.
And that would mean war... for years!


437
00:33:20.632 --> 00:33:21.838
Paco.

438
00:33:23.298 --> 00:33:25.505
A thousand of our men are in there.

439
00:33:26.007 --> 00:33:28.999
Pepe, the alcazar isn't a priority.
Don't insist.


440
00:33:37.257 --> 00:33:39.293
The alcazar isn't on my route.

441
00:33:46.548 --> 00:33:49.381
Sole command. Now that's urgent.

442
00:33:54.923 --> 00:33:57.881
Mommy, can I play the piano?

443
00:33:59.007 --> 00:34:02.545
Or someone who only reads papers,
like cabanellas.


444
00:34:02.757 --> 00:34:04.873
You know how I would solve
the command issue?


445
00:34:05.215 --> 00:34:07.206
We go to burgos and tell that junta

446
00:34:07.382 --> 00:34:10.215
that the man in charge here
is our general Franco.


447
00:34:12.632 --> 00:34:13.667
Leave the room.

448
00:34:14.048 --> 00:34:15.379
Yes, sir.

449
00:34:17.465 --> 00:34:18.500
You too.

450
00:34:19.757 --> 00:34:21.088
Yes, sir.

451
00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.707
Pepe, I can't just take command
like I'm ordering more soup.


452
00:34:26.923 --> 00:34:29.130
I don't have enough support.

453
00:34:29.298 --> 00:34:31.163
Your problem is you're too modest.

454
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.252
Maybe if we can get them
to call a meeting for some other reason.


455
00:34:34.423 --> 00:34:36.459
And once we're there...
Tactfully...


456
00:34:36.632 --> 00:34:38.168
Tactfully? Are you kidding me?

457
00:34:38.257 --> 00:34:40.043
We pound the table and that's that!

458
00:34:40.215 --> 00:34:41.796
Pepe, that's enough!

459
00:34:42.298 --> 00:34:45.040
You're all giving me
a headache today.


460
00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.796
I don't have the support, damn it.

461
00:34:56.548 --> 00:34:58.004
Is he upset?

462
00:35:00.757 --> 00:35:02.998
Nicolas, you're his brother...

463
00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.751
Does he want it or not?

464
00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.922
What he doesn't want
is to take a false step.


465
00:35:19.215 --> 00:35:20.250
Paco.

466
00:35:23.757 --> 00:35:25.122
Dismissed.

467
00:35:28.007 --> 00:35:31.420
- This palace doesn't have a chapel.
- Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.


468
00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:35.082
Do you know how important it is
to pray? Now more than ever.


469
00:35:35.257 --> 00:35:38.499
Right. You must think I win battles
only because you pray.


470
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:41.046
We're going to rest.

471
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.671
Come on, nenuca!

472
00:35:48.465 --> 00:35:51.912
Don't be angry, darling.
I'll see what I can do.


473
00:36:00.298 --> 00:36:03.165
- Goodbye, daddy.
- Goodbye, sweetheart.


474
00:36:42.215 --> 00:36:43.876
- Private.
- Yes, sir.


475
00:36:44.048 --> 00:36:46.710
Remove the flag on the balcony
and hoist this one.


476
00:36:48.257 --> 00:36:50.122
What's wrong?
You don't recognize it?


477
00:36:50.298 --> 00:36:52.914
Of course, sir.
It's the flag of the monarchy.


478
00:36:53.173 --> 00:36:56.620
The bicolored flag.
The one we've always had.


479
00:36:58.715 --> 00:37:00.205
I open it and it reads:

480
00:37:00.382 --> 00:37:04.204
"Congratulations for fourth
glorious injury. Stop.


481
00:37:04.382 --> 00:37:07.044
I eagerly await the fifth. Stop."

482
00:37:33.465 --> 00:37:35.046
Anyone know the lyrics?

483
00:37:35.507 --> 00:37:37.998
- To what, sir?
- The royal march!


484
00:37:38.423 --> 00:37:40.709
Well, I know the lyrics
from maestro marquina.


485
00:37:40.882 --> 00:37:42.918
Go on, we don't have all day!

486
00:37:45.632 --> 00:37:49.875
Glory, glory, pride in the fatherland.

487
00:37:50.048 --> 00:37:52.539
Sovereign light.

488
00:37:52.757 --> 00:37:55.419
The color of gold.

489
00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:57.876
- Life, life...
- Long live Spain,


490
00:37:57.965 --> 00:38:02.459
heads high, sons of Spain,

491
00:38:02.632 --> 00:38:05.624
as it rises once again...

492
00:38:05.715 --> 00:38:09.583
Purple and gold, immortal flag.

493
00:38:09.757 --> 00:38:11.668
Your colors

494
00:38:11.757 --> 00:38:15.375
join flesh and soul.

495
00:38:15.465 --> 00:38:19.253
Purple and gold, desire and success.

496
00:38:19.423 --> 00:38:21.334
You are my flag,

497
00:38:21.507 --> 00:38:24.749
the sign of human zeal.

498
00:38:47.298 --> 00:38:54.204
Who followed the path of the sun
across the blue sea.


499
00:39:04.465 --> 00:39:06.672
And tomorrow, the same in Seville.

500
00:39:06.757 --> 00:39:09.294
This will win over the royalists,
and there are many.


501
00:39:09.465 --> 00:39:10.921
Like sanjurjo said:

502
00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:14.207
"That Franco is a fox, all right.
Never let him out of your sight."


503
00:39:14.382 --> 00:39:17.215
I revolted to clean up the Republic,
damn it,


504
00:39:17.382 --> 00:39:19.418
not to bring back the king.

505
00:39:20.132 --> 00:39:24.080
The Republic can't be helped anymore,
general, with or without us.


506
00:39:24.257 --> 00:39:27.670
And what do you suggest?
That everyone just do whatever they want?


507
00:39:27.757 --> 00:39:29.418
We're acting like the reds.

508
00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:31.205
We'll do the same as Franco.

509
00:39:31.423 --> 00:39:33.459
The flag of the monarchy
in our squares.


510
00:39:33.632 --> 00:39:36.339
We need to stand together right now.
Later on we'll see.


511
00:39:36.423 --> 00:39:37.629
Later on...

512
00:39:37.965 --> 00:39:40.923
We'll all meet. Anywhere.

513
00:39:41.382 --> 00:39:42.622
But everyone!

514
00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.171
Here they come. Miguel.

515
00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:00.670
Look.

516
00:40:16.548 --> 00:40:17.833
Cabanellas,

517
00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:19.580
mola...

518
00:40:20.132 --> 00:40:22.669
The one they're greeting is Franco,
the one from Africa.


519
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.671
The whole military junta.

520
00:40:24.757 --> 00:40:26.917
They aren't just passing through,
something is cooking.


521
00:40:27.048 --> 00:40:28.288
Dean, sir.

522
00:40:29.215 --> 00:40:30.330
Yes. Here.

523
00:40:30.715 --> 00:40:32.000
Here I go.

524
00:40:36.965 --> 00:40:38.455
Then what do you propose?

525
00:40:38.632 --> 00:40:42.204
Mr. unamuno. I finally get
to meet you in person.


526
00:40:42.382 --> 00:40:44.839
- Good morning, general cabanellas.
- Gentlemen,


527
00:40:45.048 --> 00:40:48.120
here we have Spain's greatest writer:
Don Miguel de unamuno.


528
00:40:48.798 --> 00:40:50.334
No, don't say that.

529
00:40:50.507 --> 00:40:54.455
I wanted to thank you for my
reinstatement as Dean of the university.


530
00:40:54.632 --> 00:40:57.465
Of course, Don Miguel.
Let me to introduce everyone.


531
00:40:57.548 --> 00:40:58.879
- General mola...
- Pleasure.


532
00:40:59.048 --> 00:41:01.164
- Likewise.
- General kindelan...


533
00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:03.251
- Nice to meet you.
- General Franco...


534
00:41:03.423 --> 00:41:05.254
It's an honor to meet
such a great spaniard.


535
00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.331
- Thank you.
- And general millan astray.


536
00:41:07.507 --> 00:41:10.249
- The glorious cripple.
- It's a pleasure, a pleasure.


537
00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:14.127
Anyway, since we're all here,
did you know that I'm president


538
00:41:14.215 --> 00:41:16.376
- of the purging committee?
- A great duty, yes, sir.


539
00:41:16.548 --> 00:41:20.791
Thank you. Well, there's an arrest
that should be revoked.


540
00:41:20.965 --> 00:41:22.296
What did you say?

541
00:41:22.382 --> 00:41:23.983
It's a good friend of mine, atilano coco.

542
00:41:24.007 --> 00:41:27.249
- I'm sorry but now isn't the time.
- Sure, but when?


543
00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:29.626
Don't worry, Don Miguel.

544
00:41:29.798 --> 00:41:32.210
We'll review his case.
What did you say his name was?


545
00:41:32.382 --> 00:41:33.462
Atilano coco Martin.

546
00:41:33.632 --> 00:41:36.749
Gentlemen, I need you to take
your places for the photograph.


547
00:41:40.548 --> 00:41:41.833
Come over, Don Miguel.

548
00:41:48.465 --> 00:41:50.205
Mr. unamuno.

549
00:41:51.423 --> 00:41:54.290
Do you remember that weekly journal
you wrote in called


550
00:41:54.465 --> 00:41:57.252
"class struggle"?
Those articles were really something.


551
00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:01.629
The struggle of the working class,
the "atavistic" clergy...


552
00:42:02.215 --> 00:42:04.206
That was in my youth.

553
00:42:04.382 --> 00:42:06.919
I gave up socialism a long time ago.

554
00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:10.253
Well, not long ago
you called my legionnaires


555
00:42:10.423 --> 00:42:12.539
"bullies" and "cutthroats."

556
00:42:13.757 --> 00:42:18.205
They work so hard to climb out of the stream
and you have to drag them through the mud.


557
00:42:19.673 --> 00:42:22.039
My tongue gets the best of me
sometimes.


558
00:42:22.215 --> 00:42:24.797
Anyway...

559
00:42:25.673 --> 00:42:27.664
Right now is when every spaniard,

560
00:42:27.923 --> 00:42:32.087
as you know, needs to rectify
their mistakes and stand up for the cause.


561
00:42:32.632 --> 00:42:36.750
I'm referring to the manifesto
I heard you don't want to sign.


562
00:42:39.798 --> 00:42:40.878
I'll leave it there.

563
00:42:41.048 --> 00:42:44.791
Look at the camera.
Everyone hold still, please.


564
00:42:46.382 --> 00:42:48.122
My wife admires you very much,

565
00:42:50.382 --> 00:42:52.998
- excuse me?
- One more. Nobody move...


566
00:42:53.173 --> 00:42:54.959
My wife. She admires you very much.

567
00:43:03.965 --> 00:43:06.251
What a bunch of fools.

568
00:43:06.423 --> 00:43:08.880
- Well, then?
- They'll review the case.


569
00:43:09.507 --> 00:43:11.623
What did Franco say to you?

570
00:43:12.132 --> 00:43:13.292
- Who?
- Franco.


571
00:43:13.465 --> 00:43:16.423
The one from Africa? That one...
He's a pitiful man.


572
00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.422
- We fell into his trap.
- What?


573
00:43:37.673 --> 00:43:39.834
He wants to talk about command.

574
00:43:40.007 --> 00:43:43.750
That's what he's after, command.
You don't know him like I do.


575
00:43:44.048 --> 00:43:45.504
He's always up to something.

576
00:43:45.673 --> 00:43:48.335
Then we'll play along, cabanellas.

577
00:43:48.423 --> 00:43:51.790
And when he gets Madrid for us,
we'll send him home.


578
00:43:54.423 --> 00:43:57.665
"Franco the little fox."

579
00:44:10.632 --> 00:44:14.124
As you all know,
I see no pressing need


580
00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:18.754
for a single commander or "generalisimo”
as some have suggested.


581
00:44:19.132 --> 00:44:22.329
I prefer a junta,
as we have done so far.


582
00:44:22.507 --> 00:44:26.876
General, the first strategy wins a war.
The second loses it.


583
00:44:28.548 --> 00:44:29.833
Very well.

584
00:44:30.632 --> 00:44:32.463
Then I will not vote.

585
00:44:33.798 --> 00:44:36.460
- Who will be the first?
- I will.


586
00:44:39.215 --> 00:44:41.831
If I may, before you vote...

587
00:44:41.923 --> 00:44:43.584
One question, nothing more.

588
00:44:47.298 --> 00:44:49.664
Do you know what "baraka” means?

589
00:44:52.007 --> 00:44:54.794
When, less than two months ago,
general sanjurjo,


590
00:44:54.965 --> 00:44:57.502
god rest his soul,
was about to get on

591
00:44:57.590 --> 00:44:58.705
that plane,

592
00:44:58.882 --> 00:45:01.919
the pilot complained that
his suitcase weighed too much.


593
00:45:02.382 --> 00:45:06.921
And it's no wonder.
All of his medals were inside.


594
00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:11.663
Because sanjurjo was coming to Spain
to lead the uprising.


595
00:45:12.382 --> 00:45:16.170
He should have been the generalisimo!

596
00:45:18.298 --> 00:45:19.788
Then...

597
00:45:20.257 --> 00:45:22.714
The plane wouldn't rise,

598
00:45:23.257 --> 00:45:25.293
it wouldn't take flight...

599
00:45:26.507 --> 00:45:28.213
Things got off to a bad start.

600
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:31.501
Some might say it was the suitcase,

601
00:45:31.882 --> 00:45:35.454
others might say it was the pilot...

602
00:45:36.257 --> 00:45:37.793
Or just bad luck.

603
00:45:41.215 --> 00:45:43.501
Providential luck.

604
00:45:45.965 --> 00:45:47.580
That's "baraka."”

605
00:45:51.965 --> 00:45:56.038
my general and I fought together
fifteen years ago,


606
00:45:56.632 --> 00:45:59.374
when I founded the legion in Africa.

607
00:46:00.965 --> 00:46:02.796
I never saw him tremble.

608
00:46:04.257 --> 00:46:07.704
Because Francisco Franco bahamonde

609
00:46:08.132 --> 00:46:11.295
knows no fear and he never will.

610
00:46:12.298 --> 00:46:14.209
But not only that.

611
00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:17.126
The bullets they shot at us,

612
00:46:17.507 --> 00:46:19.043
the bullets

613
00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:22.958
that took my eye, my arm
and left me crippled...


614
00:46:23.423 --> 00:46:25.664
Didn't even graze him.

615
00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.455
They went right by him.

616
00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:34.502
They didn't even touch him.

617
00:46:37.298 --> 00:46:38.538
"Baraka,"

618
00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.751
the moors called it.

619
00:46:42.298 --> 00:46:43.913
Gentlemen,

620
00:46:44.798 --> 00:46:47.164
that's what my general has.

621
00:46:48.382 --> 00:46:49.997
"Baraka."

622
00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:54.830
I'll leave it there.

623
00:46:56.548 --> 00:46:58.129
And now vote.

624
00:47:03.507 --> 00:47:05.043
"The university of salamanca

625
00:47:05.132 --> 00:47:07.418
knows that under such
dramatic circumstances,


626
00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:10.457
it must raise its voice
and denounce the cruelties...


627
00:47:13.423 --> 00:47:16.961
Denounce the unnecessary cruelties
of the red hordes:


628
00:47:17.132 --> 00:47:19.544
Murders and useless destruction,
bombing


629
00:47:19.632 --> 00:47:22.374
sanctuaries, hospitals and schools.

630
00:47:22.548 --> 00:47:26.245
Such actions reveal great cruelty...

631
00:47:28.798 --> 00:47:32.541
Such actions reveal
great cruelty and destruction,


632
00:47:32.757 --> 00:47:36.204
- unnecessary and useless..."
- Enough!


633
00:47:39.757 --> 00:47:44.456
What terrible writing!
Give me that.


634
00:47:45.507 --> 00:47:46.997
Give me that!

635
00:48:00.882 --> 00:48:03.089
You destroy the Spanish language.

636
00:48:05.882 --> 00:48:10.546
What a heap of redundancy
and nonsense!


637
00:48:12.798 --> 00:48:14.413
Then...

638
00:48:15.132 --> 00:48:16.963
You're going to sign it?

639
00:48:23.048 --> 00:48:24.208
Franco.

640
00:48:26.007 --> 00:48:27.213
Franco.

641
00:48:30.007 --> 00:48:31.122
Franco.

642
00:48:34.882 --> 00:48:36.622
It's your turn, general.

643
00:48:43.048 --> 00:48:44.254
Franco.

644
00:49:05.757 --> 00:49:09.796
Salamanca, September 20th, 1936

645
00:49:16.632 --> 00:49:18.873
Mola, completely useless.

646
00:49:19.673 --> 00:49:21.584
Queipo de llano, a drunk.

647
00:49:22.007 --> 00:49:24.544
Cabanellas, a Mason,
everybody knows that...


648
00:49:24.757 --> 00:49:26.463
Why wouldn't they vote for you, paco?

649
00:49:26.632 --> 00:49:29.294
They're nothing compared to you.

650
00:49:31.507 --> 00:49:32.872
What's wrong?

651
00:49:33.048 --> 00:49:36.370
Plenty of talk about the new
generalisimo, but no real power, pepe.


652
00:49:36.548 --> 00:49:40.211
What about not making it public?
They're laughing at us.


653
00:49:40.548 --> 00:49:43.506
I don't understand.
Then why did they name you?


654
00:49:43.673 --> 00:49:46.005
It's exactly what I feared.

655
00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:48.705
What?

656
00:49:50.798 --> 00:49:52.629
A false step.

657
00:50:04.923 --> 00:50:07.835
- Don Miguel.
- Enriqueta, I was on my way to your house.


658
00:50:08.007 --> 00:50:09.087
Good afternoon.

659
00:50:09.257 --> 00:50:12.374
I brought you this letter.
I wrote it myself, explaining everything.


660
00:50:12.548 --> 00:50:13.708
No, listen...

661
00:50:13.798 --> 00:50:15.584
I made it clear atilano
did nothing wrong.


662
00:50:15.757 --> 00:50:18.669
It's not necessary,
they're going to review his case.


663
00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:20.626
They told me this morning.

664
00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.172
I knew they would listen to you.

665
00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:26.662
Don Miguel, you don't know
how grateful I am.


666
00:50:27.423 --> 00:50:28.503
Excuse me.

667
00:50:29.298 --> 00:50:30.538
Goodbye.

668
00:50:39.715 --> 00:50:42.457
I am the wife of pastor
atilano coco...


669
00:50:43.798 --> 00:50:46.631
Enriqueta, the letter!
Enriqueta!


670
00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:00.921
Grandpa, will you make me a lion?

671
00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:04.048
A lion? I don't know how to make a lion.
Here. A chimpanzee.


672
00:51:04.215 --> 00:51:07.833
- And stop all that shooting, boy.
- Thank you!


673
00:51:11.923 --> 00:51:13.413
- No. Not now.
- Dad...


674
00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:17.538
I can't. I can't help so many women.
And all of them crying!


675
00:51:17.632 --> 00:51:20.374
Dad, they're women crying because
their men are getting killed!


676
00:51:20.548 --> 00:51:23.460
What can I do about it?
Denounce this massacre to the world!


677
00:51:23.923 --> 00:51:25.083
Write an article.

678
00:51:26.548 --> 00:51:27.913
You aren't moved?

679
00:51:28.215 --> 00:51:29.921
I'm not moved?

680
00:51:33.007 --> 00:51:36.249
- Your heart is made of stone.
- Maria, don't talk to dad that way.


681
00:51:38.757 --> 00:51:41.499
His father is in Madrid,
fighting for the Republic!


682
00:51:41.757 --> 00:51:45.170
And you, the "honorary citizen,"
still haven't done anything!


683
00:51:45.257 --> 00:51:47.589
Something for who, the reds?

684
00:51:47.757 --> 00:51:50.373
The ones calling me a traitor
and saying I'm senile?


685
00:51:50.548 --> 00:51:52.630
The ones who shout and kill
just like these ones?


686
00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.252
Dad! Just like these ones!

687
00:51:56.382 --> 00:51:57.041
Damn it.

688
00:51:57.215 --> 00:51:58.546
Oh, my god. Another drill.

689
00:51:58.882 --> 00:52:02.750
It doesn't matter. We have to take cover.
Miguelin, hide in the closet.


690
00:52:05.215 --> 00:52:06.830
Aurelia!

691
00:52:08.048 --> 00:52:09.568
- Come on, dad.
- No, I'm staying here.


692
00:52:09.673 --> 00:52:10.913
- Dad, please.
- Leave me alone!


693
00:52:11.048 --> 00:52:13.004
If a bomb falls on me,
who cares!


694
00:52:13.173 --> 00:52:15.004
Since I'm made of stone...

695
00:52:41.423 --> 00:52:42.754
Miguelin!

696
00:52:42.965 --> 00:52:45.502
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to be with you.


697
00:52:45.673 --> 00:52:48.710
You snuck out.
If your aunts find out...


698
00:52:48.882 --> 00:52:51.089
Please, grandpa, don't tell them.

699
00:52:53.757 --> 00:52:55.873
Go on, sit there.

700
00:52:56.548 --> 00:52:58.539
And don't distract me.

701
00:53:13.882 --> 00:53:15.213
Grandpa...

702
00:53:19.673 --> 00:53:23.416
Why did you get angry with aunt Maria?

703
00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:31.921
Remember when your mother
went away


704
00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:33.750
three years ago?

705
00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:37.876
She went to heaven.

706
00:53:38.757 --> 00:53:40.588
You lost a mother

707
00:53:41.465 --> 00:53:43.046
and I lost a daughter.

708
00:53:45.173 --> 00:53:46.913
And what happened after that?

709
00:53:48.632 --> 00:53:50.122
Grandma went too.

710
00:53:50.882 --> 00:53:53.498
She was my wife,
but she called me "son."

711
00:53:56.215 --> 00:53:58.547
We were both left alone.

712
00:53:59.048 --> 00:54:00.458
Orphans.

713
00:54:02.465 --> 00:54:04.296
That was hard for us both,
wasn't it?


714
00:54:09.632 --> 00:54:12.339
But that made us stronger.

715
00:54:13.923 --> 00:54:16.460
We have a tough heart, miguelin.

716
00:54:17.882 --> 00:54:19.588
But we're not made of stone.

717
00:54:20.215 --> 00:54:23.002
We feel.

718
00:54:24.132 --> 00:54:26.373
We care about other people.

719
00:54:27.132 --> 00:54:28.292
Isn't that right?

720
00:54:31.507 --> 00:54:33.247
That's why I got angry

721
00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:34.625
with aunt Maria.

722
00:54:39.215 --> 00:54:40.921
Go on.

723
00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:43.001
Hurry back, before you get caught.

724
00:54:55.465 --> 00:54:58.298
These walls have survived
the unspeakable.


725
00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.376
For centuries.

726
00:55:01.132 --> 00:55:03.293
Even earthquakes.

727
00:55:03.465 --> 00:55:06.628
It would be a perfect air-raid shelter,
your excellency.


728
00:55:06.798 --> 00:55:08.789
Maybe we should consult the Italians.

729
00:55:08.965 --> 00:55:12.878
The Germans. Better the Germans,
they know these things.


730
00:55:14.298 --> 00:55:16.459
As far as my palace,

731
00:55:17.048 --> 00:55:19.130
it would be an honor to offer it
to the cause.


732
00:55:19.298 --> 00:55:21.380
Believe me, this is not

733
00:55:21.465 --> 00:55:23.251
a war anymore, it's a crusade.

734
00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:26.126
When will you be moving headquarters?

735
00:55:26.298 --> 00:55:28.380
Sooner than later, your excellency.

736
00:55:28.548 --> 00:55:30.914
Salamanca is the perfect location.

737
00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:33.500
Excuse me.

738
00:55:33.673 --> 00:55:37.291
Nicolas. You need to convince him
about the alcazar.


739
00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:41.046
El cid.

740
00:55:42.048 --> 00:55:43.663
What a great man, general.

741
00:55:43.882 --> 00:55:46.373
Not like the vulgar politicians nowadays.

742
00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:48.955
A Christian knight.

743
00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:51.171
Absolutely right.

744
00:55:55.382 --> 00:55:57.589
That's what made us an empire.

745
00:56:26.132 --> 00:56:27.417
Nicolas.

746
00:56:27.923 --> 00:56:29.208
I'm doing this wrong.

747
00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:31.296
Paco, don't say that.

748
00:56:31.465 --> 00:56:34.878
- Hey, stop thinking about the junta.
- No, no.


749
00:56:36.007 --> 00:56:38.623
All wrong. From the beginning.

750
00:56:40.548 --> 00:56:43.585
I'm... rushing things.

751
00:56:44.215 --> 00:56:45.455
And what do I win?

752
00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:47.421
The war?

753
00:56:55.257 --> 00:56:59.170
To go back to my barracks and in a
few years the weeds will grow back.


754
00:56:59.673 --> 00:57:02.005
And another brawl all over again.

755
00:57:03.257 --> 00:57:04.622
Spain is like that.

756
00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:06.876
Always a brawl.

757
00:57:14.465 --> 00:57:16.421
I'm sending the troops
to the alcazar.


758
00:57:19.423 --> 00:57:20.423
Paco...

759
00:57:21.257 --> 00:57:22.963
If you do that,
you'll be a hero, but...

760
00:57:23.132 --> 00:57:25.498
Spain needs heroes.

761
00:57:26.298 --> 00:57:28.710
But you'd be giving up Madrid,
right when it's about to fall.


762
00:57:29.798 --> 00:57:32.255
- The war will last for years.
- Years.


763
00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:35.171
That's what I'm saying.

764
00:57:36.965 --> 00:57:40.002
It will take years to clean this up.

765
00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:48.046
And what will you tell people?

766
00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:51.874
What will they fight for when they get sick
of burying their dead?


767
00:57:52.590 --> 00:57:54.000
For you?

768
00:58:05.007 --> 00:58:07.498
Western Christian civilization

769
00:58:20.632 --> 00:58:22.839
And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.


770
00:58:23.007 --> 00:58:26.374
Holy Mary, mother of god,
pray for us sinners


771
00:58:26.548 --> 00:58:29.506
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.


772
00:58:30.382 --> 00:58:33.089
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the lord is with thee.


773
00:58:33.257 --> 00:58:35.418
Blessed art thou among women

774
00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:37.501
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.


775
00:58:37.757 --> 00:58:41.124
Holy Mary, mother of god,
pray for us sinners


776
00:58:41.298 --> 00:58:42.538
now and at the hour...

777
00:58:42.757 --> 00:58:44.463
Of our death. Amen.

778
00:58:44.632 --> 00:58:47.874
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the lord is with thee.


779
00:58:48.090 --> 00:58:50.706
Blessed art thou among women

780
00:58:50.798 --> 00:58:52.959
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.


781
00:58:53.132 --> 00:58:56.124
Holy Mary, mother of god,
pray for us sinners


782
00:58:56.298 --> 00:58:59.165
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.


783
00:59:33.090 --> 00:59:35.502
Franco, Franco, Franco!

784
00:59:35.673 --> 00:59:38.506
Franco, Franco, Franco!

785
00:59:38.715 --> 00:59:41.912
Here he is!
A Christian knight, like El cid!


786
00:59:42.090 --> 00:59:43.170
A caudillo!

787
00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:46.252
Let the reds come for us now!
Let them come!


788
00:59:46.423 --> 00:59:48.880
Let them come and see
what we can do


789
00:59:48.965 --> 00:59:51.672
under the shade of this flag!

790
00:59:51.882 --> 00:59:54.498
- Long live death!
- Long live!


791
00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:55.840
Long live Franco!

792
00:59:55.882 --> 00:59:58.544
Franco, Franco, Franco!

793
00:59:58.757 --> 01:00:02.545
And you should see their faces.
For them Franco is the only choice.


794
01:00:03.923 --> 01:00:06.209
Then he can tell them how long
the war is going to last.


795
01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.250
Turn that down!

796
01:00:08.548 --> 01:00:10.084
General cabanellas.

797
01:00:10.173 --> 01:00:13.131
- We demand another meeting in salamanca.
- Make it tomorrow.


798
01:00:13.298 --> 01:00:14.834
Tomorrow. Tomorrow?

799
01:00:15.048 --> 01:00:18.290
You heard me. We need to designate
his powers once and for all.


800
01:00:18.465 --> 01:00:23.038
The uprising is now a holy
and glorious war,


801
01:00:23.215 --> 01:00:25.126
like those which guided

802
01:00:25.215 --> 01:00:28.628
the great saviors of the fatherland!

803
01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.376
Jarriba espana!

804
01:00:30.548 --> 01:00:34.587
Jarriba espana! 
Jarriba espana!

805
01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:40.172
Don Miguel, it's your turn.

806
01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:43.332
"Iarriba espana!"
And they think they're saying something.


807
01:00:43.507 --> 01:00:45.964
Wouldn't it be better
to turn off the radio?


808
01:00:55.465 --> 01:00:56.705
What are they saying now?

809
01:00:56.965 --> 01:00:59.798
One fatherland! One state!
One caudillo!


810
01:00:59.965 --> 01:01:01.751
I don't know. "Caudillo," I think.

811
01:01:02.007 --> 01:01:03.497
Caudillo?

812
01:01:09.298 --> 01:01:12.335
- Where are you going?
- To the novelty, to make paper figures.


813
01:01:58.465 --> 01:02:00.751
- Salvador!
- What are you doing?


814
01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:05.831
- Where were you?
- In the park reading. What's wrong?


815
01:02:06.173 --> 01:02:08.129
- Have they released atilano?
- Come on.


816
01:02:08.298 --> 01:02:11.165
- No, the novelty is full of fascists.
- Then somewhere else.


817
01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:12.170
Where?

818
01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:15.002
How should I know? Zamora!

819
01:02:26.882 --> 01:02:28.668
You were joking about zamora, right?

820
01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.626
We'll go to China if we have to.

821
01:02:31.257 --> 01:02:33.498
It's impossible to breathe here.

822
01:02:34.423 --> 01:02:36.755
Can we turn back now, please?

823
01:02:44.548 --> 01:02:46.539
At least we still have this.

824
01:02:47.965 --> 01:02:49.580
- What?
- The countryside.


825
01:02:49.757 --> 01:02:51.418
The air. The sun.

826
01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:54.627
- Spain.
- "Spain."


827
01:02:56.048 --> 01:02:59.586
People. Chatting with friends.
They can't take that away from us.


828
01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:02.957
Chatting? In this country?
You mean arguing.


829
01:03:03.048 --> 01:03:04.504
And with you, even worse.

830
01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:15.921
I used to come here with concha,

831
01:03:16.632 --> 01:03:17.917
my habit.

832
01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:21.878
She and I used to argue a lot,
since we were kids.


833
01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.081
"I don't understand you,"
she used to say,


834
01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.205
"and your books even less."

835
01:03:28.215 --> 01:03:30.957
Yeah, well...
Does anybody understand you?


836
01:03:34.715 --> 01:03:36.296
A marxist, a socialist...

837
01:03:36.382 --> 01:03:37.838
Now they're saying a fascist.

838
01:03:38.007 --> 01:03:41.579
Atheist, Christian, agnostic...
Make up your mind.


839
01:03:41.882 --> 01:03:43.588
- Make up my mind?
- Yes.


840
01:03:43.798 --> 01:03:46.540
Make up your own damn minds!
Make up your own minds!


841
01:03:46.632 --> 01:03:48.247
Why can't you just admit it for once?

842
01:03:48.423 --> 01:03:50.709
- What?
- That you change!


843
01:03:50.882 --> 01:03:53.248
That today you think one thing
and tomorrow something else!


844
01:03:53.423 --> 01:03:54.959
That you're wrong sometimes! Me?

845
01:03:55.132 --> 01:03:57.214
Yes. You were wrong about all of this.

846
01:03:57.298 --> 01:04:00.461
You supported the right without asking
what they were going to do.


847
01:04:00.632 --> 01:04:03.294
And what about you leftists,
who promised us the world


848
01:04:03.465 --> 01:04:05.080
while you led us to disaster?

849
01:04:05.257 --> 01:04:07.669
You weren't wrong? No, not you!

850
01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.956
You're never wrong!

851
01:04:10.423 --> 01:04:13.870
We leftists are trying to get Spain
out of the middle ages!


852
01:04:14.590 --> 01:04:17.047
This decrepit Spain that reeks of incense
and sacristy,


853
01:04:17.215 --> 01:04:20.207
where the poor are only free
to stay poor.


854
01:04:20.382 --> 01:04:21.667
Poor and illiterate!

855
01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:24.954
Son, you leftists fill your mouths
with freedom,


856
01:04:25.132 --> 01:04:27.999
but you have no problem swallowing
Stalin's dictatorship!


857
01:04:28.173 --> 01:04:28.787
Please.

858
01:04:28.965 --> 01:04:32.708
All this Republic has shown me
is revenge, hate and resentment!


859
01:04:32.798 --> 01:04:33.833
Revenge!

860
01:04:34.007 --> 01:04:36.714
I was talking about the Republic,
not Stalin!


861
01:04:36.882 --> 01:04:38.998
- Why bring up Stalin now?
- Look, kid.


862
01:04:39.173 --> 01:04:41.664
Why do we always have to talk
about what you want?


863
01:05:18.715 --> 01:05:21.001
If our side is so terrible,

864
01:05:23.215 --> 01:05:24.921
why are you here right now

865
01:05:25.423 --> 01:05:27.288
fleeing from the other side?

866
01:05:34.882 --> 01:05:36.122
Come on, son.

867
01:05:36.882 --> 01:05:38.497
Let's go back.

868
01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:41.046
Let's go back.

869
01:06:01.257 --> 01:06:02.622
Salvador vila?

870
01:06:03.423 --> 01:06:05.209
Yes. What's going on?
Come with us.


871
01:06:05.382 --> 01:06:06.542
Why?

872
01:06:07.173 --> 01:06:08.629
Let's go.

873
01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:11.289
I haven't done anything wrong.
Who are you?


874
01:06:11.465 --> 01:06:13.205
Hey, hey!

875
01:06:13.382 --> 01:06:14.382
Get in the car!

876
01:06:14.548 --> 01:06:17.210
- What are you doing, you bastard?
- What's going on here?


877
01:06:17.382 --> 01:06:20.920
Wait a minute. I'm unamuno.

878
01:06:22.632 --> 01:06:24.293
Friends with this red?

879
01:06:24.548 --> 01:06:26.209
Maybe you want to go with him.

880
01:06:28.507 --> 01:06:32.546
That's right. Stay there, look down
and turn your back.


881
01:06:32.715 --> 01:06:35.081
Until we're gone. Got it?

882
01:06:46.632 --> 01:06:48.213
What did I say?

883
01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:28.796
Dad, where have you been?

884
01:07:28.965 --> 01:07:31.001
- You look awful.
- What if you caught a cold?


885
01:07:31.173 --> 01:07:32.834
- Awful!
- It's almost October!


886
01:07:33.007 --> 01:07:34.747
I'll make him something.

887
01:07:37.673 --> 01:07:39.254
The mayor's widow came by.

888
01:07:39.423 --> 01:07:42.085
She wants to talk to you.
She's in the living room.


889
01:07:44.757 --> 01:07:47.214
Dad, I told her not
to let her in, but...

890
01:07:53.673 --> 01:07:55.755
Three children.

891
01:07:56.965 --> 01:07:59.832
I never thought I'd be
in such a situation,


892
01:08:00.923 --> 01:08:03.380
but without casto's salary...

893
01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.037
Two months ago you offered me money.

894
01:08:18.382 --> 01:08:20.088
And now I would be...

895
01:08:23.423 --> 01:08:25.880
I'm willing to accept it.

896
01:08:30.632 --> 01:08:32.213
Look, Ana...

897
01:08:33.048 --> 01:08:37.621
You can't imagine
how sorry I am about...


898
01:08:39.173 --> 01:08:42.620
I never, ever imagined that...

899
01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:45.706
That this would degenerate into...

900
01:08:49.090 --> 01:08:53.038
I have problems too now, and...

901
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:58.787
Yes, I offered, but right now I can't...

902
01:08:59.757 --> 01:09:01.497
I can't help you.

903
01:09:05.465 --> 01:09:07.126
Of course you can't.

904
01:09:13.715 --> 01:09:16.206
But you helped the uprising before,
didn't you?


905
01:09:18.423 --> 01:09:20.379
Five thousand pesetas.

906
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:25.297
You know what they spent
that money on?


907
01:09:26.465 --> 01:09:27.955
Buying guns,

908
01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:30.126
like the one that killed my husband!

909
01:09:32.215 --> 01:09:34.206
That's right, with your money!

910
01:09:38.757 --> 01:09:41.419
Your hands are as bloody as theirs!

911
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:45.788
Every death is yours!
You're a murder...!


912
01:09:54.132 --> 01:09:56.919
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

913
01:10:22.715 --> 01:10:24.797
The day they arrested you...

914
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:31.421
When they exiled you.

915
01:10:33.382 --> 01:10:34.918
I said:

916
01:10:35.507 --> 01:10:37.043
"Why won't you give in?

917
01:10:39.090 --> 01:10:41.422
Why don't you withdraw
your criticism of the king?"


918
01:10:44.132 --> 01:10:46.248
"Do it for me," I said.

919
01:10:50.798 --> 01:10:52.004
And you said:

920
01:10:52.173 --> 01:10:53.458
"Darling.

921
01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:56.876
Why do you think I won't give in?

922
01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:59.750
I won't give in for you.

923
01:11:01.298 --> 01:11:02.629
For my children."

924
01:11:07.715 --> 01:11:10.206
It took me so long to understand.

925
01:11:16.257 --> 01:11:17.588
And now,

926
01:11:20.465 --> 01:11:23.002
now that I finally do...

927
01:11:25.048 --> 01:11:27.255
Now is precisely when...

928
01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:58.003
University of salamanca manifesto
in support of the uprising


929
01:12:40.215 --> 01:12:42.376
This is much more than we agreed on.

930
01:12:42.632 --> 01:12:45.294
We said generalisimo,
not commander in chief.


931
01:12:45.507 --> 01:12:48.749
That would give Franco
both military and political power.


932
01:12:48.923 --> 01:12:50.629
It would give him Spain!

933
01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.125
So?

934
01:12:53.257 --> 01:12:55.748
- S07?
- All right.


935
01:12:56.548 --> 01:12:59.085
Look. Add this here:

936
01:12:59.173 --> 01:13:00.879
"While at war."

937
01:13:01.215 --> 01:13:04.048
Commander in chief "while at war."

938
01:13:04.423 --> 01:13:06.584
Gentlemen, let's hurry up.

939
01:13:06.673 --> 01:13:08.538
They're waiting for us
at the barracks.


940
01:13:11.465 --> 01:13:13.922
- I have to go to the front.
- Go ahead, don't worry.


941
01:13:19.007 --> 01:13:20.247
Nicolas.

942
01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:22.922
Today could be the most important day
of my life.


943
01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:24.330
I know.

944
01:13:24.882 --> 01:13:26.713
You can go, paco. Don't worry.

945
01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:44.422
Grandpa, are you going to die?

946
01:13:44.632 --> 01:13:46.168
Don't be silly.

947
01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:50.162
Go on, go and play.

948
01:13:51.048 --> 01:13:53.164
I don't want to leave you alone, grandpa.

949
01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:54.705
It's better this way.

950
01:13:55.382 --> 01:13:57.293
I don't belong out there.

951
01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.502
Everyone wants me to do something.
What can I do?


952
01:14:02.798 --> 01:14:06.461
I can't... I can't stop a war.
But they don't...


953
01:14:07.423 --> 01:14:09.129
They don't understand me.

954
01:14:10.965 --> 01:14:12.375
They don't understand me.

955
01:14:14.215 --> 01:14:16.001
I understand you.

956
01:14:23.423 --> 01:14:26.540
Wait a second. 
It's not here.

957
01:14:26.757 --> 01:14:30.705
The reference to the war.
"While at war." Remember?


958
01:14:30.882 --> 01:14:33.089
General kindelan proposed it.

959
01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:41.330
How many people touched the draft?

960
01:14:41.507 --> 01:14:44.795
How many? Everyone.
What are you insinuating, general?


961
01:14:46.090 --> 01:14:48.081
I want to talk to general mola.

962
01:14:49.132 --> 01:14:50.918
General mola left hours ago.

963
01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.296
Get him on the line.

964
01:14:53.923 --> 01:14:57.415
- But cabanellas...
- You don't realize what we're doing.


965
01:14:57.507 --> 01:14:59.748
I had him under my command.

966
01:14:59.923 --> 01:15:03.165
If you ordered Franco to take a hill,
nobody could ever move him from there.


967
01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:06.662
If we give him Spain now, he won't let go
until he dies. I'm telling you,


968
01:15:06.757 --> 01:15:07.496
I know him well.

969
01:15:07.673 --> 01:15:09.709
Well, and he knows you.

970
01:15:10.423 --> 01:15:11.423
What do you mean?

971
01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:15.170
Now is not the time to bicker
among ourselves, general.


972
01:15:15.257 --> 01:15:17.464
We all know each other.

973
01:15:17.715 --> 01:15:19.580
I still don't understand you.

974
01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:23.287
You're a Mason, or aren't you?

975
01:15:25.048 --> 01:15:26.788
Look.

976
01:15:26.882 --> 01:15:28.838
It's two in the morning
and we have a war to win.


977
01:15:29.007 --> 01:15:31.168
Sign it and later on we'll see.

978
01:17:21.298 --> 01:17:22.834
Concha...

979
01:17:23.465 --> 01:17:24.500
My love,

980
01:17:26.215 --> 01:17:27.751
my habit!

981
01:17:29.923 --> 01:17:31.663
He's asleep.

982
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:39.205
That's not me.

983
01:17:40.632 --> 01:17:42.168
That's someone else.

984
01:17:42.715 --> 01:17:44.421
Hold me.

985
01:17:45.215 --> 01:17:47.206
- Hold me!
- Miguel.


986
01:17:47.298 --> 01:17:50.005
My son. Wake up.

987
01:17:57.048 --> 01:17:58.254
Finally!

988
01:17:59.465 --> 01:18:00.830
Dad.

989
01:18:05.465 --> 01:18:07.626
You've been delirious for two days.

990
01:18:08.173 --> 01:18:11.040
- How do you feel?
- Fine, fine.


991
01:18:12.715 --> 01:18:14.421
What a scare you gave us.

992
01:18:16.632 --> 01:18:19.704
What a scare. Felisa!

993
01:18:25.048 --> 01:18:28.336
You're not one to be scared, darling.
Certainly not you.


994
01:18:37.465 --> 01:18:40.707
They've started classes again
and me here, at home.


995
01:18:40.923 --> 01:18:43.665
From now on forget about
everything else. That's enough.


996
01:18:44.257 --> 01:18:45.257
And eat something.

997
01:18:45.423 --> 01:18:47.414
Franco, commander in chief?

998
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:50.912
Since yesterday. And they moved
headquarters here, to the bishop's palace.


999
01:18:51.090 --> 01:18:54.787
- Two of a kind...
- Maria, please, don't get him started.


1000
01:19:02.048 --> 01:19:03.754
I'm still in time.

1001
01:19:06.507 --> 01:19:07.838
What did he say?

1002
01:19:12.132 --> 01:19:13.132
And a tie.

1003
01:19:13.257 --> 01:19:16.499
Now a tie?
Dad, you've never worn a tie.


1004
01:19:16.757 --> 01:19:18.477
Then the one I wore
to the speech at Oxford!


1005
01:19:18.632 --> 01:19:20.623
Do you really think he'll listen to you?

1006
01:19:20.798 --> 01:19:22.129
Of course.

1007
01:19:22.757 --> 01:19:25.920
He's the most sensible one.
Sensible?


1008
01:19:26.173 --> 01:19:28.038
That's not what you said
when you met him.


1009
01:19:28.215 --> 01:19:29.796
It isn't? What did I say?

1010
01:19:29.965 --> 01:19:31.671
A pitiful man!

1011
01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:33.751
Wow, you're all against me again.

1012
01:19:34.465 --> 01:19:37.912
Try to talk to his wife,
and look her in the eye.


1013
01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:41.332
- To his wife? Why?
- They say she's very Christian.


1014
01:19:41.507 --> 01:19:43.293
I'm sure she'll understand you.

1015
01:20:06.882 --> 01:20:11.296
Oh, god... please, not now...

1016
01:20:32.798 --> 01:20:34.834
At least tell him I'm here, damn it!

1017
01:20:35.007 --> 01:20:36.372
There's nothing I can do!

1018
01:20:36.548 --> 01:20:38.334
But he knows me! He knows me!

1019
01:20:38.507 --> 01:20:40.247
I won't say it again! 
Get out of here!

1020
01:20:40.423 --> 01:20:42.789
That's enough!
You can't treat me like this!


1021
01:20:42.965 --> 01:20:44.205
Nobody can!

1022
01:20:44.382 --> 01:20:45.497
Don Miguel!

1023
01:20:47.007 --> 01:20:49.589
It's me, gregorio,
you gave me your autograph.


1024
01:20:50.715 --> 01:20:52.000
How could they not let you in?

1025
01:20:52.548 --> 01:20:53.879
Tell him that.

1026
01:20:55.007 --> 01:20:58.204
Mr. unamuno, you have no idea
how much we admire you.


1027
01:20:58.632 --> 01:20:59.872
Isn't that right, paco?

1028
01:21:00.298 --> 01:21:02.414
Especially for your Christian poetry.

1029
01:21:02.757 --> 01:21:04.122
The other things...

1030
01:21:04.548 --> 01:21:06.816
- Sure you wouldn't like some coffee?
- No, thank you, ma'am.


1031
01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:09.172
- A pastry?
- No, thank you, thank you.


1032
01:21:10.215 --> 01:21:12.752
Look, general... sorry, excellency...

1033
01:21:17.465 --> 01:21:20.207
Didn't do anything wrong,
because honestly I don't know.


1034
01:21:20.382 --> 01:21:21.542
What did you say his name is?

1035
01:21:21.715 --> 01:21:24.957
Salvador vila, professor of literature
at the university.


1036
01:21:25.132 --> 01:21:26.463
Find out where he is.

1037
01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:28.209
Yes, your excellency.

1038
01:21:30.257 --> 01:21:32.623
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1039
01:21:32.798 --> 01:21:35.665
He's like a son to me.
He was my student, you know.


1040
01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:38.547
Anyway, since I'm here
talking to you...


1041
01:21:38.715 --> 01:21:41.047
Allow me to deliver this letter.

1042
01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:43.626
It's from atilano coco's wife.

1043
01:21:43.715 --> 01:21:46.331
He's an Evangelical pastor
and also a close friend of mine.


1044
01:21:46.507 --> 01:21:48.067
I was told he would be released, but...

1045
01:21:48.215 --> 01:21:49.830
I've already heard about this gentleman.

1046
01:21:50.007 --> 01:21:52.544
He's a protestant and a Mason.
A bad spaniard.


1047
01:21:55.215 --> 01:21:59.879
But he... hasn't committed any crime.

1048
01:22:00.632 --> 01:22:03.169
And there are plenty more like him.
Plenty.


1049
01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:04.955
And the reasons, frankly...

1050
01:22:05.215 --> 01:22:08.912
Not to mention all the "walks"
at night...


1051
01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:11.251
And executions

1052
01:22:11.798 --> 01:22:13.004
without a trial.

1053
01:22:18.882 --> 01:22:20.918
And what do you think
the other side does?


1054
01:22:21.673 --> 01:22:23.038
You think they don't do anything?

1055
01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:24.455
I know, I know...

1056
01:22:24.548 --> 01:22:25.754
I know they do.

1057
01:22:28.007 --> 01:22:30.168
But we're christians.

1058
01:22:33.215 --> 01:22:34.546
Indeed,

1059
01:22:34.882 --> 01:22:37.373
we take care of the enemy.

1060
01:22:41.507 --> 01:22:45.125
Before they die, the prisoners
are given the chance to confess.


1061
01:22:45.298 --> 01:22:47.129
Which means they can go to heaven.

1062
01:22:47.298 --> 01:22:48.879
The other side not even that.

1063
01:22:55.382 --> 01:22:57.293
Do you go to mass, Don Miguel?

1064
01:22:58.423 --> 01:22:59.833
Mass?

1065
01:23:01.382 --> 01:23:02.542
Your excellency...

1066
01:23:05.507 --> 01:23:06.542
Thank you.

1067
01:23:06.965 --> 01:23:07.965
Yes.

1068
01:23:08.257 --> 01:23:10.794
Your friend is being held
by the nationals.


1069
01:23:13.257 --> 01:23:15.498
But you are the nationals.

1070
01:23:15.673 --> 01:23:16.753
Don Miguel.

1071
01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:19.796
That's enough.

1072
01:24:21.673 --> 01:24:22.958
Enriqueta.

1073
01:24:24.632 --> 01:24:28.124
Remember that day I came looking
for atilano?


1074
01:24:29.465 --> 01:24:30.465
You know what?

1075
01:24:30.632 --> 01:24:33.590
Actually, I only wanted to apologize.

1076
01:24:34.257 --> 01:24:35.588
Apologize for...

1077
01:24:35.882 --> 01:24:38.624
Something stupid I said to him.
I called him...


1078
01:24:39.465 --> 01:24:40.625
I called him

1079
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:43.080
a puritan.

1080
01:24:45.007 --> 01:24:47.589
And I told him to go back
to his church and...


1081
01:24:48.548 --> 01:24:50.914
I think he got angry and...

1082
01:24:51.090 --> 01:24:55.709
I really wish I could have said
I was sorry.


1083
01:24:58.257 --> 01:25:02.705
And now it will never happen.

1084
01:25:05.715 --> 01:25:06.715
Don Miguel,

1085
01:25:08.798 --> 01:25:10.538
he will have already forgiven you.

1086
01:25:20.173 --> 01:25:21.413
Come closer.

1087
01:25:23.673 --> 01:25:24.708
Come closer.

1088
01:25:26.257 --> 01:25:27.337
Closer.

1089
01:25:30.632 --> 01:25:32.418
You'll like it, you'll see.

1090
01:25:38.007 --> 01:25:40.089
It works on kids every time!

1091
01:25:40.257 --> 01:25:41.872
- Did you hurt yourself?
- No.


1092
01:25:42.048 --> 01:25:43.709
Good afternoon, Don Miguel.

1093
01:25:45.423 --> 01:25:48.620
I came only for
a minute of your time.

1094
01:25:53.507 --> 01:25:55.668
- Would you like to sit down?
- No.


1095
01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:58.376
I'm not an armchair man.

1096
01:26:01.798 --> 01:26:03.880
Well, well, well.

1097
01:26:07.132 --> 01:26:09.123
We missed you this morning.

1098
01:26:09.882 --> 01:26:10.882
Where?

1099
01:26:12.798 --> 01:26:15.084
Where do you think, Don Miguel?
It's Sunday.


1100
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:16.921
At the cathedral.

1101
01:26:18.548 --> 01:26:20.960
I was under the weather.

1102
01:26:21.632 --> 01:26:22.838
Okay.

1103
01:26:23.173 --> 01:26:27.587
But you need to recover quickly.
You can't miss tomorrow.


1104
01:26:28.507 --> 01:26:31.579
The day of the race, no less.

1105
01:26:32.007 --> 01:26:33.588
At the university.

1106
01:26:33.965 --> 01:26:35.546
Your temple.

1107
01:26:37.673 --> 01:26:39.413
General millan astray,

1108
01:26:40.548 --> 01:26:41.548
I attended

1109
01:26:41.673 --> 01:26:45.120
that absurd celebration once,
unfortunately.


1110
01:26:45.507 --> 01:26:48.249
The exaltation of the race sounds to me

1111
01:26:48.548 --> 01:26:51.210
like the same thing as Nazi aryanism

1112
01:26:51.298 --> 01:26:52.413
and its sad sequel,

1113
01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.296
anti-semitism.

1114
01:26:55.132 --> 01:26:56.497
A sham.

1115
01:26:57.798 --> 01:26:58.798
Look,

1116
01:26:59.048 --> 01:27:02.495
- I won't argue these matters with you.
- I expected no less.


1117
01:27:05.757 --> 01:27:08.248
You intellectuals make me laugh.

1118
01:27:09.965 --> 01:27:11.921
Always so brave,

1119
01:27:12.423 --> 01:27:16.166
so upstanding,
always trying to change the world.


1120
01:27:16.715 --> 01:27:18.000
But from home.

1121
01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:20.750
From your books.

1122
01:27:21.382 --> 01:27:22.747
From your trench.

1123
01:27:24.507 --> 01:27:25.872
While we...

1124
01:27:26.257 --> 01:27:27.463
The bullies,

1125
01:27:28.548 --> 01:27:30.459
the cutthroats,

1126
01:27:32.632 --> 01:27:34.293
risk our lives,

1127
01:27:36.257 --> 01:27:37.417
our souls,

1128
01:27:38.507 --> 01:27:40.623
on the front line of combat.

1129
01:27:46.048 --> 01:27:47.163
General,

1130
01:27:48.090 --> 01:27:51.378
bravery is not only shown

1131
01:27:51.923 --> 01:27:53.163
in combat.

1132
01:27:55.465 --> 01:27:56.545
Very true.

1133
01:28:01.215 --> 01:28:04.503
Our caudillo cannot attend the ceremony
tomorrow


1134
01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:07.582
and he expressly requested
that you attend in his place.


1135
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:12.753
Why don't you go and tell him
what you told me? That it's a sham.


1136
01:28:13.757 --> 01:28:15.042
You tell him.

1137
01:28:15.882 --> 01:28:17.042
Be brave.

1138
01:28:22.048 --> 01:28:23.048
I'll leave it there.

1139
01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:43.046
They're here.

1140
01:28:53.382 --> 01:28:54.497
Dad.

1141
01:28:59.757 --> 01:29:01.588
If you talk today,
they'll have you shot.


1142
01:29:02.632 --> 01:29:04.418
Don't say anything, you hear me?

1143
01:29:08.715 --> 01:29:11.502
My girl, you of all people
telling me that.


1144
01:29:26.715 --> 01:29:27.750
Here.

1145
01:29:32.798 --> 01:29:34.083
Didn't you want a lion?

1146
01:29:36.048 --> 01:29:37.879
Give it to me when you get back.

1147
01:30:41.757 --> 01:30:42.963
They're arriving.

1148
01:30:43.173 --> 01:30:44.959
All right, follow me, please.

1149
01:30:45.257 --> 01:30:49.170
The distinguished dofia Carmen
will preside at the table,


1150
01:30:49.757 --> 01:30:52.544
accompanied by his excellency

1151
01:30:52.798 --> 01:30:55.130
the bishop and our Dean on one side.

1152
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:58.081
On the other, Don José millan,

1153
01:30:58.257 --> 01:31:00.339
Don José Maria ramos

1154
01:31:00.423 --> 01:31:01.253
and Don José Maria peman.

1155
01:31:01.423 --> 01:31:03.288
Maestro, you should say a few words.

1156
01:31:03.507 --> 01:31:04.963
You're such a good speaker.

1157
01:31:05.048 --> 01:31:07.585
No, no. I know myself.
My tongue gets the best of me.


1158
01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:15.503
Who until now have been living

1159
01:31:15.673 --> 01:31:18.210
at the expense of other spaniards.

1160
01:31:18.548 --> 01:31:23.042
Catalonia and the basque country
are a cancer and the anti-Spain!


1161
01:31:23.215 --> 01:31:25.957
Which is why we should cut off
the rotten flesh


1162
01:31:26.132 --> 01:31:28.965
with the cold scalpel
of burning patriotism!


1163
01:31:29.048 --> 01:31:31.004
- Jarriba espana!
- Jarriba!


1164
01:31:42.257 --> 01:31:43.497
Dignitaries,

1165
01:31:44.423 --> 01:31:45.913
my dear audience.

1166
01:31:47.882 --> 01:31:49.497
The Spanish empire,

1167
01:31:49.965 --> 01:31:53.753
refuge of the historic essence
of the race,


1168
01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:57.582
endures today more than ever
in the merciless fight


1169
01:31:57.798 --> 01:32:00.631
against those who only wish
to destroy


1170
01:32:00.798 --> 01:32:02.959
our sacrosanct civilization.

1171
01:32:12.382 --> 01:32:13.918
There are moments

1172
01:32:14.632 --> 01:32:17.169
when a man's spirit,

1173
01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:19.046
or that of an entire people,

1174
01:32:19.215 --> 01:32:22.378
needs to imperiously concentrate

1175
01:32:22.548 --> 01:32:24.630
its spiritual energy

1176
01:32:24.798 --> 01:32:27.164
upon the acts of pure heroism

1177
01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:29.501
of their main historical figures...

1178
01:32:29.673 --> 01:32:30.673
That's right!

1179
01:32:30.715 --> 01:32:32.296
Or those of their nation.

1180
01:32:48.423 --> 01:32:52.291
I am the wife of pastor
atilano coco.


1181
01:32:52.382 --> 01:32:55.874
He's accused of being a Mason
and actually he is.


1182
01:33:45.673 --> 01:33:48.460
Finally reaching the glory we deserve,

1183
01:33:48.632 --> 01:33:52.329
which, without a doubt,
is always granted to the brave.


1184
01:33:52.507 --> 01:33:57.627
My boys, let us build in our hearts
an alcazar of Toledo!


1185
01:34:27.132 --> 01:34:30.295
I said I didn't want to speak
because I know myself.


1186
01:34:30.465 --> 01:34:33.332
But I've been provoked and...

1187
01:34:33.507 --> 01:34:36.214
Since silence can be taken
as consent, I have to do it.


1188
01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:45.166
The defense of western Christian
civilization was mentioned here today.


1189
01:34:45.923 --> 01:34:49.165
I myself created the expression.

1190
01:34:52.132 --> 01:34:53.747
I was wrong.

1191
01:34:54.548 --> 01:34:58.336
This war is anything but civil,

1192
01:34:58.757 --> 01:35:00.622
a collective suicide

1193
01:35:00.798 --> 01:35:04.040
between those who favor fascism
and bolshevism,


1194
01:35:04.257 --> 01:35:06.748
which are nothing but two sides,

1195
01:35:07.090 --> 01:35:09.456
concave and convex,

1196
01:35:09.882 --> 01:35:12.168
of the same mental illness.

1197
01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:18.921
May I speak?

1198
01:35:19.465 --> 01:35:22.707
I just heard insults

1199
01:35:22.882 --> 01:35:27.581
against catalans and basques,
calling them a cancer and anti-Spanish,


1200
01:35:28.007 --> 01:35:31.044
but they could very well say
the same about us.


1201
01:35:31.215 --> 01:35:33.581
There's no such thing as
the anti-fatherland.


1202
01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:35.671
We're all Spanish

1203
01:35:35.882 --> 01:35:38.168
and we all have to fight together.

1204
01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:42.538
Without each other, Spain would be
mutilated. An amputee with one eye


1205
01:35:42.632 --> 01:35:44.432
like general millan astray,
an invalid of war.


1206
01:35:44.548 --> 01:35:45.583
May I speak?

1207
01:35:45.757 --> 01:35:49.500
And here is his grace the bishop who,
like it or not, is catalan,


1208
01:35:49.673 --> 01:35:51.959
and who could very well teach
some people here


1209
01:35:52.132 --> 01:35:55.204
a little Christian doctrine,
which you apparently don't know.


1210
01:35:55.382 --> 01:35:57.794
Meanwhile, I'm basque,

1211
01:35:57.965 --> 01:36:01.662
and I have no problem
teaching you Spanish,


1212
01:36:02.215 --> 01:36:03.921
which you don't know either.

1213
01:36:04.257 --> 01:36:06.122
I want to speak!

1214
01:36:15.423 --> 01:36:16.458
Spain!

1215
01:36:16.632 --> 01:36:17.632
One!

1216
01:36:17.923 --> 01:36:18.708
Spain!

1217
01:36:18.798 --> 01:36:19.798
Great!

1218
01:36:19.882 --> 01:36:20.621
Spain!

1219
01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:21.670
Free!

1220
01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:23.580
Long live millan astray!
Long live death!


1221
01:36:23.798 --> 01:36:25.163
Long live death!

1222
01:36:26.298 --> 01:36:27.333
"Long live death."

1223
01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:30.206
That's like saying "death to life."

1224
01:36:31.382 --> 01:36:34.874
As an expert in paradoxes, I assure you

1225
01:36:35.048 --> 01:36:36.629
I've never understood that one.

1226
01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:41.879
Long live death a thousand times.
And death to the intellectuals!


1227
01:36:42.257 --> 01:36:43.042
Please, don't...

1228
01:36:43.215 --> 01:36:46.048
Traitors.
Death to the intellectual traitors.


1229
01:36:46.965 --> 01:36:48.205
Millan astray,

1230
01:36:48.923 --> 01:36:51.335
this is the temple of intelligence!

1231
01:36:51.507 --> 01:36:52.747
My temple!

1232
01:36:58.882 --> 01:36:59.962
To vanquish

1233
01:37:00.257 --> 01:37:01.588
is not to convince.

1234
01:37:02.548 --> 01:37:04.163
To conquer

1235
01:37:04.632 --> 01:37:06.964
is not to convert.

1236
01:37:07.507 --> 01:37:09.589
You will conquer because you have

1237
01:37:10.382 --> 01:37:13.249
brute force, but you will never convince

1238
01:37:13.423 --> 01:37:17.462
because to convince you need
to persuade.


1239
01:37:18.423 --> 01:37:22.792
You will conquer but you will never
convince. I have spoken.


1240
01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:27.751
- Red!
- Traitor!


1241
01:37:27.923 --> 01:37:29.288
Son of a bitch!

1242
01:37:56.548 --> 01:37:58.413
Don Miguel! My hand!

1243
01:38:02.132 --> 01:38:04.623
My hand, take my hand!

1244
01:38:07.507 --> 01:38:08.838
Unamuno!

1245
01:38:10.173 --> 01:38:13.040
Take the hand of our
commander in chief's wife.


1246
01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:27.920
Get us out of here.

1247
01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:30.625
Don't let go.

1248
01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:35.083
Face the sun with your new shirt

1249
01:38:35.257 --> 01:38:38.215
that yesterday you embroidered in red.

1250
01:38:43.507 --> 01:38:46.123
You really couldn't keep your mouth shut,
Don Miguel?


1251
01:38:47.173 --> 01:38:48.538
Why didn't you stay quiet?

1252
01:38:49.257 --> 01:38:51.589
All my husband wants
is for Spain


1253
01:38:52.007 --> 01:38:54.794
to be a quiet place,
where people don't


1254
01:38:54.965 --> 01:38:57.377
shout and fight.

1255
01:38:58.257 --> 01:39:01.249
That's all we want for Spain.
Peace.


1256
01:39:01.673 --> 01:39:03.755
For god's sake, a peaceful Spain.

1257
01:39:58.507 --> 01:40:02.250
Francisco Franco won the war in 1939
and imposed a military dictatorship.


1258
01:40:03.715 --> 01:40:07.879
Despite the defeat of fascist regimes in
world war il,


1259
01:40:08.048 --> 01:40:11.006
Franco managed to stay in
power until his death in 1975.


1260
01:40:38.382 --> 01:40:43.126
Salvador vila and atilano coco
were executed without a trial.


1261
01:40:45.090 --> 01:40:48.912
After his speech, Miguel de unamuno
was dismissed again as Dean


1262
01:40:49.090 --> 01:40:51.126
and placed under police surveillance.

1263
01:40:51.298 --> 01:40:53.459
He died of a heart attack
two months later.


1264
01:40:56.965 --> 01:41:04.792
On June 15th 1977 Spain held
Democratic elections once again.
