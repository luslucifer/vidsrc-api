1
00:02:48.193 --> 00:02:49.319
There you are!

2
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:53.824
And how was your day? 
Any progress in saving the world?

3
00:02:53.908 --> 00:02:55.597
I'm working on it.

4
00:02:57.328 --> 00:03:00.144
So I guess you
changed your mind about tonight?

5
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.959
Not really. Told you I
didn't want to miss it.

6
00:03:02.995 --> 00:03:05.232
What happened with that
dinner with the London people?

7
00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.215
- You made it sound so unavoidable.
- It was.


8
00:03:08.257 --> 00:03:10.655
Fortunately, they missed their plane.

9
00:03:13.387 --> 00:03:14.972
Here's to...

10
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.016
...stolen moments.

11
00:03:23.356 --> 00:03:26.964
You look so handsome, 
I better see if I can catch up.

12
00:03:49.717 --> 00:03:51.073
Nobody home?

13
00:03:51.094 --> 00:03:53.910
I left some Security Council transcripts out

14
00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:55.370
but everybody's gone.

15
00:03:55.432 --> 00:03:57.706
Anything earth-shattering?

16
00:03:57.727 --> 00:04:01.481
No, it's just important enough
not to be left out.

17
00:04:03.232 --> 00:04:05.276
You look incredible.

18
00:04:05.944 --> 00:04:08.259
Yeah, but we have to hurry.

19
00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:25.819
I prefer this one.

20
00:04:28.927 --> 00:04:30.303
Right.

21
00:04:58.042 --> 00:04:59.919
<i>Can I have a picture, please?</i>

22
00:05:00.128 --> 00:05:02.379
<i>This way. This way, please.</i>

23
00:05:03.423 --> 00:05:05.196
<i>This way, please.</i>

24
00:05:06.031 --> 00:05:07.595
<i>One more.</i>

25
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.434
There's Andrew. 
Good to see him. Robynn, hi.

26
00:05:14.726 --> 00:05:16.311
Steven, how are you?

27
00:05:16.472 --> 00:05:18.313
- Nice to see you.
- Emily, you look wonderful.


28
00:05:18.397 --> 00:05:19.690
Keep up the good work.

29
00:05:20.024 --> 00:05:23.027
That's Steven Taylor and his wife, Emily.

30
00:05:23.903 --> 00:05:25.243
Well, at last!

31
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.156
The beautiful people have arrived.

32
00:05:27.198 --> 00:05:30.535
- Fantastic dress!
- Thank you.


33
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.101
I didn't expect to see
you tonight, with Greenspan and all.

34
00:05:34.143 --> 00:05:34.852
Why's that?

35
00:05:34.894 --> 00:05:37.772
I thought you'd be up
to your ass in alligators.

36
00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:40.650
Rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.

37
00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:43.278
All I need is her phone number.

38
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.760
Absolutely. I must see about something.

39
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.679
Lovely! Thank you, darling.

40
00:05:48.513 --> 00:05:51.766
The temple's hieroglyphics are supplications...

41
00:05:52.016 --> 00:05:53.434
...to the gods of fertility.

42
00:05:53.518 --> 00:05:55.687
I do believe I know his work.

43
00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.963
Perhaps we could come along
to your studio one day...

44
00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:29.437
You said he wasn't coming.

45
00:06:29.473 --> 00:06:32.331
He changed his mind. 
I tried to call you.

46
00:06:32.644 --> 00:06:34.667
What are we going to do?

47
00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:38.108
Nothing. Just relax.

48
00:06:38.942 --> 00:06:42.049
- He doesn't know who I am, right?
- No.


49
00:06:43.363 --> 00:06:44.990
You're a peach.

50
00:06:46.033 --> 00:06:47.910
Lunch tomorrow?

51
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:50.205
And tomorrow...

52
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:51.914
...and tomorrow.

53
00:06:52.373 --> 00:06:56.440
So I leave you alone for 30
seconds, and you elope with a younger man.

54
00:06:56.477 --> 00:06:58.940
Steven, I'd like to
introduce you to David Shaw.

55
00:06:58.976 --> 00:07:01.404
- Pleasure! Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.


56
00:07:01.446 --> 00:07:02.635
David is a painter.

57
00:07:02.718 --> 00:07:06.576
I saw some of his pieces downtown. 
I thought they were amazing

58
00:07:06.612 --> 00:07:09.392
What brings you uptown
to our little inbred soirÃ©e?

59
00:07:09.475 --> 00:07:13.250
Actually, Emily was kind enough
to wrangle me an invite.

60
00:07:13.287 --> 00:07:14.794
Me too.

61
00:07:16.691 --> 00:07:18.964
So tell me about your work...

62
00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:20.195
...David?

63
00:07:20.278 --> 00:07:22.823
A couple small galleries
carry me when there's space.

64
00:07:22.906 --> 00:07:24.846
- You studied formally?
- Berkeley, Cal Arts.


65
00:07:24.888 --> 00:07:29.037
Almost formally graduated too.

66
00:07:30.122 --> 00:07:31.999
Too much study pollutes the soul.

67
00:07:32.036 --> 00:07:34.335
- And he's good?
- He's wonderful.


68
00:07:34.377 --> 00:07:37.923
I'd love to see your pieces. 
Maybe we can arrange a time.

69
00:07:37.965 --> 00:07:41.551
- Whenever you want.
- Emily has your number?


70
00:07:42.385 --> 00:07:46.786
No. The gallery can get ahold of me. 
You know which one?

71
00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:48.747
Oh, yes, yes...

72
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.853
If you're as good as she says...

73
00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:54.440
...I'll pass the word
on to my acquisitive friends.

74
00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:57.339
Thanks. That's very generous.

75
00:07:57.402 --> 00:07:59.133
Nice to meet you.

76
00:07:59.237 --> 00:08:00.572
You too.

77
00:08:00.609 --> 00:08:02.470
Pleasure to see you.

78
00:08:24.473 --> 00:08:26.517
<i>We cannot be held accountable...</i>

79
00:08:26.553 --> 00:08:30.375
<i>...for the actions of others
that require us to defend ourselves.</i>

80
00:08:34.817 --> 00:08:36.590
Madame Ambassador.

81
00:08:36.903 --> 00:08:40.218
This is the same speech he
gave in Geneva 3 months ago...

82
00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:41.762
word for word.

83
00:08:46.788 --> 00:08:48.520
Show-off!

84
00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:51.794
- Ann, good morning, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.


85
00:08:51.878 --> 00:08:54.844
Steven, spreads are blowing out.

86
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.343
The way things look in Europe,
it could turn into a bloodbath

87
00:08:58.426 --> 00:09:02.389
- So what are we talking?
- At least 1'50 basis points.


88
00:09:02.472 --> 00:09:04.182
The Bundesbank will have to tag along

89
00:09:04.223 --> 00:09:07.477
Your yen and mark positions will get hammered

90
00:09:07.602 --> 00:09:09.229
So what's our exposure?

91
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:11.106
Based on my preliminary trend model?

92
00:09:11.357 --> 00:09:13.401
Yes. No frills

93
00:09:13.437 --> 00:09:15.445
Think Chernobyl

94
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.666
<i>Greenpoint, next stop</i>

95
00:09:52.984 --> 00:09:56.509
- What you got there?
- It's a little surprise


96
00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.324
Come on up

97
00:10:03.205 --> 00:10:05.206
Here's your fortune

98
00:10:06.124 --> 00:10:10.900
<i>"You have a deep interest
in all that is artistic"</i>

99
00:10:11.296 --> 00:10:12.861
It's true

100
00:10:15.176 --> 00:10:17.719
You didn't have to get this for me

101
00:10:18.512 --> 00:10:21.516
You need a little civilizing

102
00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:26.167
What do you need?

103
00:10:30.358 --> 00:10:32.214
What do you need?

104
00:10:39.077 --> 00:10:42.538
You know, we could be
in Belize this time tomorrow

105
00:10:42.955 --> 00:10:44.332
Belize...

106
00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:47.460
- You ever been there?
- No


107
00:10:47.711 --> 00:10:50.297
You'd think you'd died and went to heaven

108
00:10:50.339 --> 00:10:52.758
But I already think that

109
00:11:03.978 --> 00:11:06.626
You look so pretty today

110
00:12:19.017 --> 00:12:22.917
<i>Hey, it's David. Leave one. 
I'll get back to you</i>

111
00:12:23.981 --> 00:12:27.694
<i>David, hi. It's Steven Taylor. 
I'm finishing a little early today</i>

112
00:12:27.735 --> 00:12:30.905
<i>I thought I might come
by and check out your work</i>

113
00:12:30.947 --> 00:12:33.366
<i>Say about six</i>

114
00:12:33.825 --> 00:12:38.747
<i>If that flies with you, call
me at my office here at 5-4-4-...</i>

115
00:12:38.998 --> 00:12:41.208
<i>...1-8-1-7</i>

116
00:12:42.292 --> 00:12:44.607
<i>I look forward to seeing you</i>

117
00:12:47.506 --> 00:12:49.842
What are you going to do?

118
00:12:52.012 --> 00:12:54.555
I guess I'll call him

119
00:12:55.348 --> 00:12:58.289
Be kind of weird
if I didn't, wouldn't it?

120
00:12:58.393 --> 00:13:01.125
You're playing with fire, David

121
00:13:03.524 --> 00:13:07.382
If you're so upset about it,
why'd you give him my number?

122
00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:10.135
I didn't

123
00:13:30.261 --> 00:13:32.096
Mr. Taylor?

124
00:13:32.555 --> 00:13:35.079
Hi. Here, sit down

125
00:13:36.184 --> 00:13:38.437
That was stupid. 
Sorry about that

126
00:13:42.066 --> 00:13:44.005
Thanks very much

127
00:13:44.568 --> 00:13:45.965
Drink?

128
00:13:46.111 --> 00:13:47.952
No, I'm okay

129
00:13:47.988 --> 00:13:50.220
Unless you want another one

130
00:13:50.241 --> 00:13:53.140
I just had us meet here
because my place is hard to find

131
00:13:53.177 --> 00:13:55.371
Like an illegal loft space?

132
00:13:56.456 --> 00:13:58.333
That's one way to put it

133
00:13:58.833 --> 00:14:02.442
I feel like I'm knee-deep in bohemian cachet

134
00:14:02.478 --> 00:14:04.173
Lead on

135
00:14:14.267 --> 00:14:17.583
- How's Emily?
- She's fine, thank you


136
00:14:18.564 --> 00:14:20.878
Well, be sure and say "hi"

137
00:14:20.914 --> 00:14:22.609
I will

138
00:14:24.361 --> 00:14:27.203
One more. One more floor

139
00:14:27.239 --> 00:14:30.243
Building's over 100 years old now

140
00:14:34.956 --> 00:14:36.958
Watch your step

141
00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:57.751
Well, I can certainly see
what Emily was drawn to

142
00:14:57.787 --> 00:14:59.273
Yeah? What's that?

143
00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:01.797
Your work. It's...

144
00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:04.092
...very trashy...

145
00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:05.677
...but potent

146
00:15:05.713 --> 00:15:07.158
Trashy?

147
00:15:07.194 --> 00:15:09.597
Is that what she said?

148
00:15:13.706 --> 00:15:15.249
Your anger it's...

149
00:15:16.167 --> 00:15:18.149
...it's very controlled

150
00:15:18.336 --> 00:15:20.379
You think I'm angry?

151
00:15:21.422 --> 00:15:23.800
The anger in your work

152
00:15:24.009 --> 00:15:26.678
The color of despair

153
00:15:27.387 --> 00:15:29.828
Wonder where that comes from

154
00:15:30.516 --> 00:15:32.434
I don't know

155
00:15:32.643 --> 00:15:35.218
Inside, I guess

156
00:15:35.255 --> 00:15:37.794
Inside... indeed

157
00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.301
Nowhere to sit but the goddamned bed

158
00:15:52.707 --> 00:15:55.084
You know, I envy you

159
00:15:55.168 --> 00:15:56.668
You envy me?

160
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.384
You should be...

161
00:15:58.421 --> 00:16:01.320
...flattered. I'm not prone to envy

162
00:16:01.356 --> 00:16:04.407
It's a pathetic emotion

163
00:16:05.512 --> 00:16:08.014
Sneaks up on you like cancer

164
00:16:08.056 --> 00:16:10.663
I've got it and you know why

165
00:16:12.478 --> 00:16:15.523
- No
- Oh, of course you do


166
00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:21.487
One of life's legitimately sublime experiences. It's so...

167
00:16:21.988 --> 00:16:23.927
...utterly complete

168
00:16:23.964 --> 00:16:25.200
What?

169
00:16:25.784 --> 00:16:28.224
Fucking my wife

170
00:16:30.748 --> 00:16:32.713
Mr. Taylor, I don't know...

171
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:36.316
I think it's about
time you called me Steven

172
00:16:39.423 --> 00:16:41.468
We're in love, sir

173
00:16:42.886 --> 00:16:47.098
That's it?

174
00:16:47.599 --> 00:16:51.228
You steal the crown
jewel of a man's soul...

175
00:16:51.311 --> 00:16:55.775
...and your only excuse is
some candy-ass Hallmark card sentiment?

176
00:16:55.858 --> 00:16:58.861
Even if it was
true, that's not good enough!

177
00:16:58.986 --> 00:17:00.654
If what were true?

178
00:17:00.696 --> 00:17:02.177
She is in love

179
00:17:02.365 --> 00:17:03.621
You, buddy...

180
00:17:03.658 --> 00:17:05.160
...you're in business

181
00:17:05.201 --> 00:17:06.620
What the hell are you saying?

182
00:17:06.661 --> 00:17:10.394
I'm saying you did not
meet my wife by chance

183
00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:14.023
I'm saying you didn't study at Berkeley

184
00:17:16.464 --> 00:17:21.927
I'm saying you learned to paint while
doing 3 to 6 in Soledad Prison...

185
00:17:21.964 --> 00:17:25.890
...for relieving a widow in
San Francisco of her life savings

186
00:17:25.974 --> 00:17:27.642
Your second conviction...

187
00:17:27.976 --> 00:17:30.354
...if I'm not mistaken

188
00:17:32.356 --> 00:17:36.380
Your real name is Winston
Lagrange, which I rather like

189
00:17:36.417 --> 00:17:39.759
Born to pure trailer trash in Barstow, California

190
00:17:39.796 --> 00:17:41.908
Ward of the courts
since the age of ten

191
00:17:41.949 --> 00:17:45.953
You went from pickpocket to car thief
to con man till you found out...

192
00:17:45.995 --> 00:17:49.353
...that you had a
way with the softer sex

193
00:17:49.582 --> 00:17:53.316
No doubt looking for that
mother you can barely remember

194
00:17:53.712 --> 00:17:57.340
A life made up
completely of depressing little scams...

195
00:17:57.382 --> 00:17:58.514
...until now

196
00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.307
Where'd you get all that?

197
00:18:00.344 --> 00:18:03.639
All that is for sale. 
The hell of it is, you're not...

198
00:18:03.723 --> 00:18:06.351
- ...half-bad with a brush
- Thank you


199
00:18:06.643 --> 00:18:08.583
Called rehabilitation

200
00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:11.668
It's called a con. 
My wife's the grand prize

201
00:18:11.705 --> 00:18:14.651
But you set your
sights too high this time

202
00:18:14.714 --> 00:18:16.659
She loves me

203
00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:18.760
She loves David Shaw, your invention

204
00:18:18.797 --> 00:18:22.764
But you've made a fundamental miscalculation

205
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.224
Play it out

206
00:18:24.286 --> 00:18:26.044
Love conquers all

207
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.626
Emily divorces me. 
She marries you

208
00:18:30.836 --> 00:18:32.410
Given your history

209
00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:35.861
her advisors are going
to insist upon a prenup

210
00:18:36.174 --> 00:18:38.010
You might storm the castle...

211
00:18:38.051 --> 00:18:41.368
...but you ain't getting the
keys to the treasure room, ever

212
00:18:41.404 --> 00:18:42.682
I don't care about that

213
00:18:42.974 --> 00:18:45.517
The swindler doesn't care about a trust fund

214
00:18:45.518 --> 00:18:47.019
that can buy fucking Barstow?

215
00:18:47.056 --> 00:18:48.521
Why don't you cut the shit!

216
00:18:48.771 --> 00:18:52.442
You care, or we would
not be having this conversation!

217
00:18:52.817 --> 00:18:55.508
The only thing that
stops you from bolting now

218
00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:57.676
is bad genes and greed

219
00:19:01.076 --> 00:19:02.849
Now what?

220
00:19:03.204 --> 00:19:05.081
Choices

221
00:19:05.373 --> 00:19:09.085
I can tell Emily who you
are, and life will imitate art

222
00:19:09.122 --> 00:19:11.733
You become a starving painter, game over

223
00:19:12.714 --> 00:19:14.361
Or?

224
00:19:14.841 --> 00:19:17.323
Or you can cash out

225
00:19:17.511 --> 00:19:19.226
Cash out?

226
00:19:19.263 --> 00:19:21.286
Half a million dollars

227
00:19:21.556 --> 00:19:23.517
Tax-free

228
00:19:26.812 --> 00:19:29.670
Just for walking away from her?

229
00:19:29.732 --> 00:19:32.798
I said tax-free. 
I didn't say free

230
00:19:34.779 --> 00:19:37.219
What's 500 grand for?

231
00:19:38.408 --> 00:19:41.015
Killing my wife

232
00:19:49.128 --> 00:19:50.713
Emily?

233
00:19:50.755 --> 00:19:53.675
Imagine my embarrassment if they're not the same

234
00:19:53.717 --> 00:19:55.969
$100,000 now...

235
00:19:56.053 --> 00:19:59.952
...$400,000 after, cash-and-carry

236
00:20:05.938 --> 00:20:08.107
You're out of your mind

237
00:20:08.441 --> 00:20:10.484
Not really

238
00:20:11.694 --> 00:20:13.237
Why?

239
00:20:13.487 --> 00:20:18.681
I appreciate your curiosity, but
my agenda doesn't concern you

240
00:20:20.412 --> 00:20:23.853
I'll go straight to Emily
and tell her all this

241
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:28.149
That would be my word against yours...

242
00:20:28.186 --> 00:20:29.510
...Winston

243
00:20:29.547 --> 00:20:31.987
And what if I call the cops?

244
00:20:34.593 --> 00:20:38.911
Have you ever been to Boca Raton, Florida?

245
00:20:41.435 --> 00:20:45.820
A lady there was carrying
on with a younger man

246
00:20:45.856 --> 00:20:50.465
He was a hell of a tennis player. 
When the affair ended...

247
00:20:50.501 --> 00:20:51.993
...he disappeared...

248
00:20:52.029 --> 00:20:55.387
...along with the lady's bearer bonds

249
00:20:57.077 --> 00:20:59.182
You sure you've never been there?

250
00:21:00.079 --> 00:21:02.478
Not that I recall

251
00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:07.901
An acquaintance of mine has
a photograph of the suspect

252
00:21:08.839 --> 00:21:12.092
All they need is a name...

253
00:21:12.593 --> 00:21:15.721
...as in, strike three

254
00:21:16.139 --> 00:21:17.807
15 years

255
00:21:17.844 --> 00:21:19.956
No parole

256
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:26.295
You think you got a box
big enough to hold $100,000 in cash?

257
00:21:28.318 --> 00:21:32.365
Come by the apartment around 12 o'clock tomorrow

258
00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:36.327
Unless you have a previous luncheon engagement

259
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.103
I assume you know where I live

260
00:22:35.557 --> 00:22:38.248
This is crazy. 
I not undestand. 
I'm your best friend, all right?

261
00:22:38.284 --> 00:22:40.438
Half the year goes by
and you don't say one thing?

262
00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.982
Do you love him? 
Will you leave Steven?

263
00:22:43.066 --> 00:22:44.401
Ok, but talk to me

264
00:22:44.443 --> 00:22:47.008
I will if you
shut up for one second

265
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:49.260
I'm waiting

266
00:22:50.323 --> 00:22:53.306
I didn't tell you
because you adore Steven, ok?

267
00:22:53.342 --> 00:22:55.100
You cried at our wedding, for God's sake

268
00:22:55.121 --> 00:22:58.124
- I cry at every wedding
- No, you don't


269
00:22:58.958 --> 00:23:01.293
You like the idea of us

270
00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:03.254
Everybody does

271
00:23:03.291 --> 00:23:05.966
But you have no idea who he is

272
00:23:06.028 --> 00:23:08.781
- Steven? I know Steven
- No, you don't


273
00:23:09.386 --> 00:23:15.309
You don't know that everything always
has to be on his terms, ok?

274
00:23:15.345 --> 00:23:19.084
You don't know that he has
no real interest in who I am

275
00:23:24.777 --> 00:23:27.280
What are you going to do?

276
00:23:27.316 --> 00:23:29.095
I don't know

277
00:23:29.324 --> 00:23:33.078
I'm going to figure out a way to tell him. 
He deserves that

278
00:23:33.162 --> 00:23:35.143
What makes you think he doesn't know?

279
00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.040
Because there's no way

280
00:23:37.124 --> 00:23:41.400
I mean, he knows
that something's not right but...

281
00:23:43.006 --> 00:23:45.654
This David have a last name?

282
00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:48.365
Shaw. David Shaw

283
00:23:48.469 --> 00:23:50.847
And he knows about your family?

284
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.079
What do you mean?

285
00:23:53.642 --> 00:23:54.857
What do you think I mean?

286
00:23:54.893 --> 00:23:57.667
C'mon. We don't talk
about that kind of stuff

287
00:23:57.704 --> 00:24:00.440
In six months, you never mentioned money?

288
00:24:00.477 --> 00:24:01.608
No!

289
00:24:01.692 --> 00:24:03.825
Believe me, okay?

290
00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:09.075
David has absolutely no interest
in anything other than painting and...

291
00:24:09.409 --> 00:24:13.288
- ...and... me
- And you


292
00:24:14.247 --> 00:24:16.813
Is that why you're
not wearing your wedding ring?

293
00:24:21.297 --> 00:24:23.237
Oh, my God!

294
00:24:23.925 --> 00:24:25.405
What?

295
00:24:25.551 --> 00:24:27.908
I left it at David's

296
00:24:37.606 --> 00:24:40.109
Working late?

297
00:24:40.484 --> 00:24:43.435
No, I was having a drink with Raquel

298
00:24:43.472 --> 00:24:46.387
And how is the Castilian femme fatale?

299
00:24:48.784 --> 00:24:52.288
By the way, I saw
your friend David this evening

300
00:24:52.622 --> 00:24:53.769
Really?

301
00:24:53.915 --> 00:24:57.461
He honored me with a
visit at his industrial hideaway

302
00:24:57.498 --> 00:24:58.733
You're kidding

303
00:24:59.088 --> 00:25:01.350
And where's that?

304
00:25:01.386 --> 00:25:03.556
Greenpoint, Brooklyn

305
00:25:03.592 --> 00:25:05.391
How'd you get his number?

306
00:25:05.428 --> 00:25:09.370
I called some of
those obscure galleries you prowl...

307
00:25:09.406 --> 00:25:11.747
...dropped your name

308
00:25:11.852 --> 00:25:12.977
You're right

309
00:25:13.144 --> 00:25:15.501
He's very talented

310
00:25:17.649 --> 00:25:19.234
Did you buy anything?

311
00:25:19.318 --> 00:25:21.633
I made him an offer

312
00:25:27.326 --> 00:25:29.016
And?

313
00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.415
And he's chewing on it

314
00:25:50.768 --> 00:25:52.875
Good morning

315
00:26:10.999 --> 00:26:13.751
- Hi, it's me
- Hey, how you doing?


316
00:26:13.793 --> 00:26:16.118
- I left my wedding ring
- I know


317
00:26:16.155 --> 00:26:18.444
<i>I put it away before he got here</i>

318
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.530
Thank God!

319
00:26:22.344 --> 00:26:24.555
What did you guys talk about?

320
00:26:25.931 --> 00:26:29.998
He wasn't here that
long, so just the work

321
00:26:30.035 --> 00:26:32.397
He didn't have a clue

322
00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:36.005
<i>He said that he made you an offer</i>

323
00:26:36.026 --> 00:26:37.673
Matter of fact, he did

324
00:26:37.709 --> 00:26:38.945
What piece?

325
00:26:38.987 --> 00:26:41.886
It's one you haven't seen

326
00:26:42.157 --> 00:26:43.784
I thought I'd seen all of them

327
00:26:43.867 --> 00:26:45.849
<i>Well, almost</i>

328
00:26:46.454 --> 00:26:50.416
Listen, turns out I got to
take a rain check on lunch today

329
00:26:50.499 --> 00:26:53.419
- Why? What's wrong?
- Nothing, nothing


330
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:56.506
Some people want to see my sketches...

331
00:26:56.589 --> 00:26:58.946
...and it'd be a good commission

332
00:26:59.051 --> 00:27:00.657
You sound funny

333
00:27:00.693 --> 00:27:02.053
Do I?

334
00:27:02.137 --> 00:27:03.680
<i>Yeah</i>

335
00:27:03.972 --> 00:27:07.163
No. I guess it's called being broke, sweetheart

336
00:27:08.561 --> 00:27:10.636
Ok. Tomorrow, then

337
00:27:10.672 --> 00:27:12.839
Reservation for two

338
00:27:12.875 --> 00:27:15.005
Quiet table, in back

339
00:27:15.041 --> 00:27:17.195
Very quiet

340
00:27:18.863 --> 00:27:20.532
You know I love you

341
00:27:20.568 --> 00:27:22.247
I know

342
00:27:22.284 --> 00:27:24.099
- Bye
- Bye


343
00:28:10.044 --> 00:28:12.359
- Is that by...?
- Yeah


344
00:28:13.381 --> 00:28:17.134
People with money always go
for the same things, eh?

345
00:28:17.426 --> 00:28:19.804
And what are those?

346
00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:24.132
Anything, everything, as long as it's recognizable

347
00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:28.084
Don't worry. None of
this would've been yours anyway

348
00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.316
Everything you see here, it's mine

349
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.154
Why don't you drop
that there and come here

350
00:28:40.076 --> 00:28:42.015
That's nice

351
00:28:46.583 --> 00:28:49.649
There was a robbery
in the building last year

352
00:28:49.686 --> 00:28:51.929
Probable means of entrance...

353
00:28:51.966 --> 00:28:54.174
...was this driveway gate

354
00:28:54.258 --> 00:28:58.367
That granite faÃ§ade creates a
blind spot on the surveillance cameras

355
00:28:58.403 --> 00:29:00.578
It was never corrected, for aesthetic reasons

356
00:29:00.614 --> 00:29:01.975
How do you know that?

357
00:29:02.058 --> 00:29:04.602
I'm on the board

358
00:29:08.982 --> 00:29:11.741
You enter as I
leave at 8 p. m.

359
00:29:11.777 --> 00:29:15.176
I won't pull out of
the driveway till it's clear

360
00:29:15.212 --> 00:29:17.324
The gate takes 5 seconds to close

361
00:29:17.361 --> 00:29:20.369
Hug the right side of
the wall as I drive by

362
00:29:20.411 --> 00:29:23.999
Then you enter the
stairs by the service elevator

363
00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:28.983
The key to the front door
also works here for the service entrance

364
00:29:36.804 --> 00:29:40.120
I'm going to take the key
from Emily's purse before I leave...

365
00:29:40.156 --> 00:29:41.898
...and I'll put it in this...

366
00:29:41.934 --> 00:29:45.668
...and hide it here, right behind the pipe

367
00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:50.361
- Where're you going to be?
- At my regular card game


368
00:29:50.397 --> 00:29:51.950
Why don't you leave me your key?

369
00:29:51.986 --> 00:29:54.781
My key implicates me. 
Her key implicates no one

370
00:29:54.823 --> 00:29:56.914
It could've been lost or stolen

371
00:29:56.951 --> 00:30:00.309
In any case, she
won't be around to explain

372
00:30:00.345 --> 00:30:02.003
Why not make a copy of the key?

373
00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.731
It's two loose ends,
the key and the locksmith

374
00:30:06.836 --> 00:30:08.964
This door is always bolted

375
00:30:08.965 --> 00:30:11.300
She won't notice, even if she checks it

376
00:30:11.592 --> 00:30:14.136
You'll be in the stairwell at 9:30

377
00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.535
By that time, Emily
will be taking her bath

378
00:30:17.572 --> 00:30:19.313
She will? How do you know?

379
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:23.584
Because that's what she does
on nights that I play cards

380
00:30:23.897 --> 00:30:26.003
Why not do it in the tub?

381
00:30:26.525 --> 00:30:29.360
Because that'll look like cold-blooded murder

382
00:30:29.402 --> 00:30:33.094
when it has to appear
that she surprised the intruder

383
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:34.283
All right?

384
00:30:36.202 --> 00:30:39.246
This is a separate telephone line

385
00:30:39.282 --> 00:30:42.291
Exactly 10 p. m., 
I will call here

386
00:30:42.374 --> 00:30:44.815
Emily will answer the phone

387
00:30:45.837 --> 00:30:48.235
You will enter and a...

388
00:30:48.423 --> 00:30:52.197
a tragic confrontation will ensue

389
00:30:52.886 --> 00:30:54.950
It should appear to be...

390
00:30:54.987 --> 00:30:56.854
...stupid...

391
00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:59.372
...and spur-of-the-moment

392
00:30:59.894 --> 00:31:04.607
I've always thought "bludgeon" has a spur-of-the-moment sound

393
00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:07.068
Maybe you could use one of these

394
00:31:08.528 --> 00:31:10.979
Rifle the jewelry in the bedroom

395
00:31:11.015 --> 00:31:13.429
Disable the service entrance lock

396
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:15.207
Make it look like it was jimmied

397
00:31:15.244 --> 00:31:19.706
Put the key back under the pipe,
then leave the way you came in

398
00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:23.002
And what happens if
the plan goes to hell?

399
00:31:23.544 --> 00:31:25.484
It won't

400
00:31:42.981 --> 00:31:44.984
So when is this card game of yours?

401
00:31:45.025 --> 00:31:46.986
- Tomorrow night
- Tomorrow?


402
00:31:47.023 --> 00:31:48.576
No fucking way!

403
00:31:48.613 --> 00:31:50.052
A man with your rÃ©sumÃ©

404
00:31:50.053 --> 00:31:52.220
should come up with
an alibi in no time

405
00:31:52.257 --> 00:31:54.348
100 thousand

406
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:59.395
A man with my rÃ©sumÃ©
should take the money and run

407
00:31:59.432 --> 00:32:02.023
Bet you 400 thousand more you don't

408
00:32:49.512 --> 00:32:50.685
<i>Yes, I understand that</i>

409
00:32:50.722 --> 00:32:53.145
<i>But if we can't
get numbers on refugee density...</i>

410
00:32:53.182 --> 00:32:56.149
<i>...then we can't position the
resources to deal with it</i>

411
00:32:56.185 --> 00:33:00.461
<i>Ok. Great. I'll tell her to
expect it later today. Thank you</i>

412
00:33:04.324 --> 00:33:05.989
<i>"A tout alheure"</i>

413
00:33:07.241 --> 00:33:08.805
<i>"Bon apetit"</i>

414
00:33:25.634 --> 00:33:28.720
That's not happiness to see me, is it?

415
00:33:28.929 --> 00:33:30.561
Try surprise

416
00:33:30.597 --> 00:33:32.641
I don't expect to have
a hole in my schedule...

417
00:33:32.678 --> 00:33:37.168
...and I thought lunch with
my beautiful wife would be indicated

418
00:33:37.204 --> 00:33:38.821
But I guess you have other plans

419
00:33:38.857 --> 00:33:41.296
- What makes you say that?
- You seem in such a hurry


420
00:33:41.333 --> 00:33:42.694
No. It's just errands

421
00:33:42.777 --> 00:33:45.202
Like shopping for a new wedding ring

422
00:33:45.238 --> 00:33:47.846
You know? One of the settings felt loose...

423
00:33:47.882 --> 00:33:50.453
...so I took it in. 
It'll be ready tomorrow

424
00:33:50.489 --> 00:33:53.059
And what if there were no tomorrow?

425
00:33:53.205 --> 00:33:54.957
What does that mean?

426
00:33:54.994 --> 00:33:58.816
Wouldn't you regret not having
one last lunch with your husband?

427
00:33:59.087 --> 00:34:01.027
Of course

428
00:34:32.748 --> 00:34:36.440
- Enjoy your meal
- Thank you very much


429
00:34:48.307 --> 00:34:50.611
I must reply to Francesca about this weekend.

430
00:34:50.613 --> 00:34:51.873
- Want to do it?
- Sure


431
00:34:52.019 --> 00:34:54.000
All right, we'll go out...

432
00:34:55.147 --> 00:34:58.734
I got to break this up. 
Excuse me one minute

433
00:36:00.259 --> 00:36:04.160
<i>Hey, it's David. Leave one. 
I'll get back to you</i>

434
00:36:04.848 --> 00:36:06.828
<i>David? Are you there?</i>

435
00:36:08.393 --> 00:36:10.166
<i>He was waiting for me...</i>

436
00:36:10.207 --> 00:36:11.501
...to take me to lunch

437
00:36:11.647 --> 00:36:14.692
<i>There was nothing I could do</i>

438
00:36:17.089 --> 00:36:19.174
You know...

439
00:36:19.175 --> 00:36:22.888
I can't do this anymore. 
I've got to tell him tonight

440
00:36:24.118 --> 00:36:26.267
Hi, I'm here, I'm here

441
00:36:27.247 --> 00:36:28.936
I'm really sorry

442
00:36:29.458 --> 00:36:30.547
It's okay

443
00:36:30.583 --> 00:36:34.004
He's never done that before. 
Something's wrong. He knows

444
00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.594
No, he doesn't

445
00:36:35.631 --> 00:36:38.822
Don't let your mind get away from you

446
00:36:39.427 --> 00:36:41.846
I cannot live like this anymore

447
00:36:41.888 --> 00:36:45.036
It's not right. 
It's not fair to him. 
I've got to tell him

448
00:36:45.073 --> 00:36:47.148
Tell him what, exactly?

449
00:36:47.185 --> 00:36:50.021
Tell him everything, tonight

450
00:36:51.398 --> 00:36:54.047
We've waited this long. 
Hold off another day...

451
00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:56.737
<i>...so we can figure it out together</i>

452
00:36:56.773 --> 00:36:57.863
You know?

453
00:36:57.899 --> 00:36:59.969
So I can help you

454
00:37:00.741 --> 00:37:03.828
- I don't know
- I do


455
00:37:04.662 --> 00:37:06.810
I do know

456
00:37:07.289 --> 00:37:09.709
<i>Honey, don't panic</i>

457
00:37:26.102 --> 00:37:28.396
Good night, Mr. Taylor

458
00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.211
I'm on my way

459
00:37:30.315 --> 00:37:33.005
<i>Everything's prepared for you</i>

460
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:36.968
Give my best to Mrs. Taylor

461
00:38:08.522 --> 00:38:11.296
So how was the rest of your day?

462
00:38:12.151 --> 00:38:14.425
Fairly brutal

463
00:38:15.155 --> 00:38:17.554
I'm sorry to hear about that

464
00:38:20.535 --> 00:38:22.809
I don't want you to go tonight

465
00:38:24.957 --> 00:38:26.730
What's wrong?

466
00:38:28.336 --> 00:38:30.860
I'd like to talk to you

467
00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:35.218
It's too late

468
00:38:35.552 --> 00:38:38.326
They'll never get anybody to fill in

469
00:38:39.014 --> 00:38:43.998
Besides, I beat them last week. 
They'll want their money back

470
00:40:25.128 --> 00:40:27.318
You scared me

471
00:40:28.549 --> 00:40:31.260
I just wanted to say goodbye

472
00:40:41.813 --> 00:40:44.545
- I'll call you later
- Ok


473
00:40:45.191 --> 00:40:47.861
I might go to Nick's for a burger

474
00:40:47.862 --> 00:40:50.322
If nobody's here, don't worry

475
00:40:51.198 --> 00:40:54.723
I won't, but you might want to reconsider

476
00:40:54.765 --> 00:40:56.293
Why is that?

477
00:40:56.329 --> 00:40:59.186
I had Janice make
one of her legendary roasts

478
00:40:59.248 --> 00:41:00.938
Really?

479
00:41:02.377 --> 00:41:05.255
Thought we'd eat before the game

480
00:41:05.714 --> 00:41:07.529
Wish me luck

481
00:41:08.008 --> 00:41:09.905
Good luck

482
00:42:57.876 --> 00:42:59.586
$1,000 to you, George

483
00:42:59.623 --> 00:43:01.234
Fold

484
00:43:04.801 --> 00:43:06.636
- Call
- Down and dirty


485
00:43:06.678 --> 00:43:08.951
Last one, gentlemen

486
00:43:15.145 --> 00:43:19.087
- Got to have more than that
- Three sixes still bets


487
00:43:52.769 --> 00:43:56.586
- Gentlemen, same game
- It's getting a little boring


488
00:44:05.992 --> 00:44:07.327
I'm out

489
00:44:27.807 --> 00:44:30.894
Must be morning in Hong Kong

490
00:44:51.833 --> 00:44:53.585
There's my cards

491
00:44:53.621 --> 00:44:56.442
Let's have a better hand this time

492
00:45:33.962 --> 00:45:36.276
You've got to be kidding me

493
00:45:43.995 --> 00:45:45.350
<i>Mute</i>

494
00:46:00.679 --> 00:46:02.556
Hellow

495
00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.579
That's a serious bet

496
00:46:05.789 --> 00:46:07.353
Hellow

497
00:46:09.961 --> 00:46:11.525
Hellow

498
00:46:13.587 --> 00:46:16.153
Who is this?

499
00:47:42.183 --> 00:47:43.894
I'm in

500
00:47:44.019 --> 00:47:47.189
- Put your money up, here we go
- Just in time!


501
00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:50.046
Different winner this time, though, guys

502
00:47:50.317 --> 00:47:52.611
I liked the last one

503
00:49:24.294 --> 00:49:26.441
Oh, my God!

504
00:49:29.424 --> 00:49:30.727
What happened?

505
00:49:30.729 --> 00:49:32.453
<i>Mrs. Taylor, we have your location</i>

506
00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:34.291
He's in the kitchen... he's in the kitchen...

507
00:49:34.305 --> 00:49:37.078
<i>Mrs. Taylor? 
Please stay on the line</i>

508
00:49:37.114 --> 00:49:39.581
<i>Ma'am? Ma'am?</i>

509
00:49:45.859 --> 00:49:47.632
Oh, Jesus!

510
00:51:06.362 --> 00:51:08.510
Police! Open up!

511
00:51:16.706 --> 00:51:18.521
Open up!

512
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:22.588
- Mr. Taylor?
- We're all right, we're ok, we're...


513
00:51:22.734 --> 00:51:25.592
He's in the kitchen. 
I think he's dead. Follow me

514
00:51:37.855 --> 00:51:40.336
You didn't hear any...

515
00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:43.527
...strange sounds...

516
00:51:43.819 --> 00:51:47.052
...prior to your entering the kitchen?

517
00:51:47.782 --> 00:51:50.247
No, just the phone call

518
00:51:50.284 --> 00:51:53.705
But before that, nothing unusual?

519
00:52:01.046 --> 00:52:04.487
- How you guys doing?
- We're pretty set here


520
00:52:04.523 --> 00:52:07.282
I want you to dust the elevator cage...

521
00:52:07.303 --> 00:52:09.185
...and the banister

522
00:52:09.222 --> 00:52:12.872
Mo, be out of
here in 15, 20 minutes

523
00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:15.749
Maybe

524
00:52:22.903 --> 00:52:25.197
- Detective Karaman
- Steven Taylor


525
00:52:25.239 --> 00:52:27.970
Pleasure, sir. 
Mind if I ask you a few questions?

526
00:52:28.054 --> 00:52:29.472
No. Not at all

527
00:52:29.618 --> 00:52:32.038
I noticed what I
assume to be your footprints...

528
00:52:32.079 --> 00:52:34.853
...in the blood around the deceased

529
00:52:35.125 --> 00:52:37.377
- Can I assume those are yours?
- Yes, you may


530
00:52:37.419 --> 00:52:39.983
May I ask what
you were doing, Mr Taylor?

531
00:52:40.338 --> 00:52:42.737
Making sure he was dead

532
00:52:43.634 --> 00:52:46.783
- Was he?
- Appeared to be, yes


533
00:52:46.819 --> 00:52:48.493
Take his pulse?

534
00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:50.245
No

535
00:52:51.266 --> 00:52:53.060
You see right there?

536
00:52:54.145 --> 00:52:56.230
Did you lean over him for something?

537
00:52:56.272 --> 00:52:59.359
I tried to determine whether he was breathing

538
00:53:00.068 --> 00:53:02.820
- Was he?
- Not at that time


539
00:53:02.862 --> 00:53:04.906
Let's take a look

540
00:53:27.931 --> 00:53:29.787
Something wrong?

541
00:53:31.727 --> 00:53:35.169
Aside from a dead
man lying in my kitchen?

542
00:53:35.857 --> 00:53:38.109
For a moment, I
thought you knew the man

543
00:53:38.146 --> 00:53:40.820
- I don't think so
- Why's that?


544
00:53:41.529 --> 00:53:43.552
I never forget a face

545
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:44.616
Anything else?

546
00:53:44.699 --> 00:53:46.097
No

547
00:53:46.368 --> 00:53:48.808
Your wife must come
down to give a statement

548
00:53:48.845 --> 00:53:49.872
When?

549
00:53:49.914 --> 00:53:51.623
As soon as she's ready

550
00:53:51.665 --> 00:53:52.749
Mr. Taylor...

551
00:53:52.791 --> 00:53:56.337
...are you aware of anyone
who might wish your wife harm?

552
00:53:56.379 --> 00:53:59.153
My wife has no enemies

553
00:54:00.342 --> 00:54:02.407
Thanks, Detective

554
00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:15.586
I know, baby, I know

555
00:54:15.691 --> 00:54:17.464
It's okay

556
00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:22.490
You're going to be all right

557
00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:32.105
What do you think?

558
00:54:32.126 --> 00:54:33.711
I believe her

559
00:54:33.794 --> 00:54:35.776
What about him?

560
00:54:38.925 --> 00:54:41.072
I couldn't say

561
00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:46.913
You know, Mo...

562
00:54:48.352 --> 00:54:51.126
...rich people are different from you and me

563
00:54:51.162 --> 00:54:52.397
How?

564
00:54:52.481 --> 00:54:55.693
They got a fuck of a
lot more money, for one thing

565
00:54:56.318 --> 00:54:58.487
Very good, Bobby

566
00:55:51.295 --> 00:55:55.361
Hey, Mo, you going to
turn it up, or what?

567
00:55:58.552 --> 00:56:00.951
I like it like this

568
00:56:01.305 --> 00:56:03.162
You had said before...

569
00:56:03.767 --> 00:56:06.498
...that they did not speak

570
00:56:06.561 --> 00:56:08.010
They didn't

571
00:56:08.047 --> 00:56:09.460
They listened

572
00:56:09.481 --> 00:56:11.650
What about background noise? 
Did you hear anything else...?

573
00:56:11.686 --> 00:56:14.158
There wasn't any. She told you

574
00:56:14.194 --> 00:56:16.988
Maybe you should let
your wife answer the questions

575
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:19.637
I think she's been through enough tonight

576
00:56:20.534 --> 00:56:23.001
We're almost through, Mrs. Taylor

577
00:56:23.037 --> 00:56:26.760
There's just a couple more
things I'd like to ask

578
00:56:26.797 --> 00:56:30.482
<i>Remember what time you got home, Mr. Taylor?</i>

579
00:56:32.172 --> 00:56:36.906
11, 11:30. Came from my regular
card game at the Drake Club

580
00:56:40.764 --> 00:56:42.745
You'll love this

581
00:56:48.022 --> 00:56:51.401
We've I.D.'d the man
who broke into your home

582
00:56:51.735 --> 00:56:52.777
May I?

583
00:56:52.819 --> 00:56:54.633
Sure

584
00:56:57.366 --> 00:56:59.201
This man is a career criminal

585
00:56:59.284 --> 00:57:03.227
You couldn't dream up a
better defense for justifiable homicide

586
00:57:04.249 --> 00:57:08.565
Your wife's on three. 
She says it's an emergency

587
00:57:26.648 --> 00:57:29.212
How old is your boy?

588
00:57:32.654 --> 00:57:34.374
One month

589
00:57:34.411 --> 00:57:36.095
Is he ill?

590
00:57:36.132 --> 00:57:37.493
Colic

591
00:57:37.743 --> 00:57:40.267
May God watch over
your son and protect him

592
00:57:40.496 --> 00:57:41.872
And you as well

593
00:57:43.874 --> 00:57:45.981
Well, be glad we cleared that up

594
00:57:46.711 --> 00:57:50.715
I'm going to ask you not
to leave the city, Mrs Tylor

595
00:57:50.799 --> 00:57:52.092
But she is

596
00:57:52.134 --> 00:57:55.574
We're going to her mother's house. 
Roger has the telephone number

597
00:57:55.611 --> 00:57:56.867
Wait. Hold on

598
00:57:56.951 --> 00:57:59.600
Why? She hasn't been charged. 
Her statement's complete

599
00:57:59.641 --> 00:58:02.186
So it's really just a matter of courtesy

600
00:58:02.228 --> 00:58:04.084
Courtesy on our part

601
00:58:05.106 --> 00:58:09.068
If you think of anything
else, you give me a ring

602
00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:12.801
I don't know what else
there is to think of

603
00:58:12.864 --> 00:58:15.012
Probably nothing

604
00:58:15.784 --> 00:58:17.077
May you go in safety

605
00:58:17.493 --> 00:58:18.870
And you as well

606
00:58:18.871 --> 00:58:20.435
Thank you

607
00:59:13.513 --> 00:59:15.703
My baby!

608
00:59:35.328 --> 00:59:37.831
I'm just down the hall, baby

609
01:00:17.958 --> 01:00:20.626
Here you go

610
01:00:22.337 --> 01:00:26.216
By tomorrow, this will all
seem like a bad dream

611
01:00:32.097 --> 01:00:35.288
And what if there were no tomorrow?

612
01:00:42.276 --> 01:00:44.840
You know better than that

613
01:00:48.365 --> 01:00:50.513
Sleep well

614
01:01:09.054 --> 01:01:11.228
Please tell me

615
01:01:11.265 --> 01:01:13.621
How could something like this happen?

616
01:01:13.658 --> 01:01:15.400
Sandra, I don't know

617
01:01:15.436 --> 01:01:19.148
I've gone over it a thousand times myself

618
01:01:19.184 --> 01:01:21.546
The world's gone crazy

619
01:01:51.517 --> 01:01:53.362
Roger's prepared a statement the D.A.

620
01:01:53.364 --> 01:01:55.108
wants me to sign this evening

621
01:01:55.145 --> 01:01:58.044
So I'll head back into the city and...

622
01:01:58.148 --> 01:02:00.922
...and come back in the
morning to pick up Emily...

623
01:02:00.959 --> 01:02:02.841
...if she's all right

624
01:02:04.364 --> 01:02:08.263
<i>David... it's me</i>

625
01:02:09.494 --> 01:02:12.518
I just wanted to tell you I'm okay

626
01:02:14.374 --> 01:02:18.650
<i>I'm not in the city, but
I'll call as soon as I can</i>

627
01:02:20.297 --> 01:02:22.279
<i>I love you</i>

628
01:02:27.973 --> 01:02:30.455
I don't want her to be rushed

629
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:47.890
No, of course not

630
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:49.913
I don't want her to be rushed either

631
01:02:49.954 --> 01:02:52.645
I'm going to check on our patient

632
01:03:23.115 --> 01:03:26.557
Sorry, David. Emily's resting right now

633
01:03:26.577 --> 01:03:30.916
<i>But I think you and I
we've got something to talk about</i>

634
01:04:02.908 --> 01:04:04.681
Who was he?

635
01:04:06.079 --> 01:04:09.060
Somebody I met at Berkeley

636
01:04:09.623 --> 01:04:12.314
Can he be connected to you?

637
01:04:12.752 --> 01:04:14.900
Not anymore

638
01:04:21.177 --> 01:04:24.848
You got any idea who you're fucking with?

639
01:04:26.225 --> 01:04:27.831
Yeah

640
01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:29.938
You hired me to kill your wife...

641
01:04:29.979 --> 01:04:32.565
...because you couldn't do the wet work yourself

642
01:04:32.606 --> 01:04:34.880
Well, neither could I

643
01:04:38.113 --> 01:04:40.845
So how do you know
he didn't talk to someone?

644
01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:43.692
Ron was a good man

645
01:04:43.729 --> 01:04:45.933
Not quite good enough

646
01:04:52.794 --> 01:04:53.837
Ok

647
01:04:54.881 --> 01:04:57.362
So what's plan B?

648
01:04:57.675 --> 01:05:01.242
It's a little coincidental if
there's another attempt on her life

649
01:05:01.278 --> 01:05:03.494
Gee, you think?

650
01:05:05.684 --> 01:05:07.499
So we wait

651
01:05:07.562 --> 01:05:09.584
For what?

652
01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:13.255
I'll let you know

653
01:05:15.882 --> 01:05:18.698
Hey, Steve...

654
01:05:21.826 --> 01:05:25.560
Do I keep fucking your
wife in the meantime, or what?

655
01:05:37.594 --> 01:05:39.658
Thank you, Charles

656
01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:46.608
Steven called while you were asleep

657
01:05:46.645 --> 01:05:49.794
He's getting everything ready
for you to come home

658
01:05:50.149 --> 01:05:53.215
He wants to send
the car for you tomorrow

659
01:05:53.277 --> 01:05:55.634
I'm not going home

660
01:05:56.364 --> 01:06:00.305
I'm going to move in
with Raquel for a while

661
01:06:01.202 --> 01:06:03.684
Em, what's going on?

662
01:06:05.082 --> 01:06:07.606
I'm leaving Steven

663
01:06:40.578 --> 01:06:43.790
They've started liquidating your long positions to cover

664
01:06:44.583 --> 01:06:45.880
Which ones?

665
01:06:45.917 --> 01:06:47.878
DMG and Barclays

666
01:06:47.914 --> 01:06:49.843
Why didn't anybody tell me?

667
01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:53.530
We tried, Steven. 
We couldn't find you

668
01:06:53.566 --> 01:06:56.450
I said no calls!

669
01:07:29.506 --> 01:07:31.034
- Albert
- Hi


670
01:07:31.071 --> 01:07:33.052
May I please have our house key?

671
01:07:33.053 --> 01:07:35.450
- Sure enough, Mrs. Taylor
- Thank you


672
01:07:35.512 --> 01:07:36.868
What happened to yours?

673
01:07:36.931 --> 01:07:39.809
I've absolutely no idea. 
It doesn't work

674
01:07:40.143 --> 01:07:42.771
Did my husband change the locks?

675
01:07:43.396 --> 01:07:46.128
No, not that I know of

676
01:09:01.146 --> 01:09:02.919
Emily, it's me

677
01:09:02.982 --> 01:09:05.260
I didn't hear you come in

678
01:09:05.297 --> 01:09:08.092
Because you left the front door wide open

679
01:09:10.907 --> 01:09:12.721
- Emily
- Don't


680
01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.392
I'm your husband

681
01:09:18.249 --> 01:09:21.043
Oh, God! I can't stay here

682
01:09:21.127 --> 01:09:25.631
- It's all right. We'll get out of here tonight, all right?
- No


683
01:09:25.673 --> 01:09:27.978
I can't stay with you, Steven

684
01:09:28.014 --> 01:09:30.282
I can't stay with you anymore

685
01:09:30.345 --> 01:09:33.828
Raquel's waiting for me downstairs

686
01:09:48.406 --> 01:09:50.867
Okay, there are fresh towels in the bathroom...

687
01:09:50.908 --> 01:09:53.028
...and you can have anything
you want in the fridge...

688
01:09:53.036 --> 01:09:55.372
...including your favourite yogurt

689
01:09:55.664 --> 01:09:58.063
Let me ask you a question

690
01:09:58.793 --> 01:10:03.109
What do you think Steven would
do if he knew about David?

691
01:10:08.303 --> 01:10:12.473
Screwing around is the second
oldest reason to kill somebody

692
01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:15.206
Really? And what would be the first?

693
01:10:15.810 --> 01:10:17.792
Money, honey

694
01:10:22.819 --> 01:10:25.028
Oh, no but... Steven's already rich...

695
01:10:25.065 --> 01:10:29.492
...and you with your money,
you must've had a prenup

696
01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:34.268
Tell me you had a prenup

697
01:10:34.748 --> 01:10:37.459
He offered. I said no

698
01:10:39.085 --> 01:10:42.006
So if you die, he gets, like...

699
01:10:42.047 --> 01:10:44.279
...a hundred million bucks?

700
01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:46.740
Something like that

701
01:10:49.972 --> 01:10:52.047
Lucky guy

702
01:10:52.048 --> 01:10:53.810
Yeah

703
01:11:09.202 --> 01:11:14.269
I assume you have a very good reason for asking me to do this 
- Yes

704
01:11:14.957 --> 01:11:18.190
We'll sure miss you around here

705
01:11:18.587 --> 01:11:20.151
Come

706
01:11:20.839 --> 01:11:23.181
Come and see me on your way out

707
01:11:23.217 --> 01:11:26.804
- This is Robert Harrington
- How do you do?


708
01:11:26.887 --> 01:11:30.579
Bobby is the Deputy Director
of the Commodities Trade Commission

709
01:11:30.615 --> 01:11:32.331
Please

710
01:11:33.144 --> 01:11:35.877
- Take all the time that you need
- Thank you


711
01:11:43.322 --> 01:11:45.032
Mrs. Taylor...

712
01:11:45.069 --> 01:11:48.264
...passing this kind of
information, even to a spouse...

713
01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.995
...is unethical

714
01:11:50.037 --> 01:11:51.810
I understand

715
01:11:53.833 --> 01:11:58.046
Your husband has been buying U.
S. and foreign bonds on margin...

716
01:11:58.083 --> 01:12:01.028
...and using those securities as collateral

717
01:12:01.508 --> 01:12:02.926
That's illegal

718
01:12:02.962 --> 01:12:07.160
In fact, his company's been
under investigation for almost a year

719
01:12:07.348 --> 01:12:08.729
Some months ago...

720
01:12:08.766 --> 01:12:11.644
...U.S. interest rates started moving against him

721
01:12:11.686 --> 01:12:14.735
He should've gotten some horrific margin calls...

722
01:12:14.772 --> 01:12:17.880
...but the banks he's in
bed with have hidden the losses...

723
01:12:17.916 --> 01:12:20.716
...hoping that things will turn around

724
01:12:20.737 --> 01:12:22.886
It isn't happening

725
01:12:23.032 --> 01:12:24.871
Sooner or later...

726
01:12:24.908 --> 01:12:27.327
...those margin calls will come

727
01:12:27.744 --> 01:12:30.852
And when they do, your husband will be...

728
01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.126
...wiped out

729
01:12:56.401 --> 01:12:58.403
Yep, where's the subpoena?

730
01:12:58.445 --> 01:13:01.468
But I can't get the records without it

731
01:13:01.781 --> 01:13:04.743
- I've waited two days
- Mo


732
01:13:06.578 --> 01:13:08.560
Just get back to me

733
01:13:10.082 --> 01:13:11.907
Detective...

734
01:13:11.908 --> 01:13:14.148
- Please sit down
- Thank you


735
01:13:16.005 --> 01:13:19.071
To what do I
owe the pleasure, Mrs. Taylor?

736
01:13:21.261 --> 01:13:24.077
I have some information about my husband

737
01:13:24.113 --> 01:13:25.619
Concerning?

738
01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:30.479
It seems he's in serious financial trouble...

739
01:13:30.562 --> 01:13:33.399
...and he was hiding it from me

740
01:13:33.482 --> 01:13:36.236
And I thought that...

741
01:13:36.277 --> 01:13:38.508
...might be a possible reason...

742
01:13:38.696 --> 01:13:40.343
...a possible reason for him to...

743
01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:43.034
Hire someone to kill you?

744
01:13:43.159 --> 01:13:44.974
Yes

745
01:13:47.831 --> 01:13:50.938
I know what you're worth, Mrs. Taylor...

746
01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:54.317
...and that kind of
money is always a motive

747
01:13:54.354 --> 01:13:56.757
Do you mean he's already a suspect?

748
01:13:56.841 --> 01:13:58.781
Was

749
01:13:59.052 --> 01:14:02.680
Until we traced a phone call
he made the night you were attacked

750
01:14:02.716 --> 01:14:06.497
The trace led us to an
automated quote system at his office

751
01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:10.606
It lasted from five minutes
before ten to nine minutes after

752
01:14:10.642 --> 01:14:14.568
That has to be one of
the cleaner alibis I've come across

753
01:14:15.193 --> 01:14:17.759
I took your case apart a thousand times...

754
01:14:17.795 --> 01:14:19.490
...then I put it back together again

755
01:14:19.574 --> 01:14:21.784
There was always one piece left...

756
01:14:21.821 --> 01:14:23.995
...like a screw that didn't fit

757
01:14:24.037 --> 01:14:28.062
The dead man had a
wallet, cash and change, driver's license...

758
01:14:28.098 --> 01:14:30.898
...membership card to a video store, but...

759
01:14:30.935 --> 01:14:33.151
...not a single key

760
01:14:33.172 --> 01:14:35.153
Not one

761
01:14:35.383 --> 01:14:38.135
Not even to his apartment

762
01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:45.560
Elliot, it's a zero-sum game. 
You don't have the balls for it

763
01:14:45.602 --> 01:14:49.314
<i>Tylor, by tomorrow, neither of
us will have any balls left</i>

764
01:14:49.356 --> 01:14:51.587
- Don't panic
- You're damn right I am


765
01:14:51.623 --> 01:14:53.944
You drop 50 million in a day

766
01:14:53.986 --> 01:14:56.697
<i>You know how fast 50 becomes 500?</i>

767
01:14:56.739 --> 01:14:59.012
Not now. What's the spot rate?

768
01:14:59.049 --> 01:15:01.187
<i>We're sitting at ground zero</i>

769
01:15:01.223 --> 01:15:03.537
<i>You're telling me, "Think happy thoughts"?</i>

770
01:15:03.558 --> 01:15:04.419
I said, not now!

771
01:15:04.455 --> 01:15:08.230
<i>I'm sorry, but I have a
caller who says this is an emergency</i>

772
01:15:08.272 --> 01:15:10.420
<i>He says it concerns Emily</i>

773
01:15:12.214 --> 01:15:15.404
- Who is it?
- He won't identify himself


774
01:15:19.555 --> 01:15:21.620
<i>Who is this?</i>

775
01:15:22.016 --> 01:15:25.520
<i>A tragic confrontation will ensue</i>

776
01:15:26.103 --> 01:15:28.168
<i>It should appear to be...</i>

777
01:15:28.205 --> 01:15:29.946
<i>...stupid and...</i>

778
01:15:29.983 --> 01:15:32.074
<i>...spur-of-the-moment.</i>

779
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:36.031
<i>I've always thought that
"bludgeon" has a spur-of-the-moment sound</i>

780
01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:40.181
<i>Maybe you could use one of these here</i>

781
01:15:43.623 --> 01:15:47.127
Meet me at the diner at
the corner of Maiden and South

782
01:15:47.168 --> 01:15:48.983
Right now

783
01:15:55.677 --> 01:15:57.852
He was a con named Ronald Diggs

784
01:15:57.888 --> 01:16:01.079
Fresh from state prison in California

785
01:16:21.413 --> 01:16:23.478
Must be hard for you

786
01:16:56.701 --> 01:16:58.834
Mr. Taylor

787
01:16:58.871 --> 01:17:02.646
You didn't get those fancy shoes
dirty walking over here, did you?

788
01:17:02.667 --> 01:17:04.595
What do you want?

789
01:17:04.632 --> 01:17:06.524
The rest of my money

790
01:17:06.837 --> 01:17:10.487
You didn't fulfill your end
of the bargain, did you?

791
01:17:11.301 --> 01:17:13.053
So?

792
01:17:13.094 --> 01:17:15.158
So what do I get?

793
01:17:15.555 --> 01:17:18.089
You get this superfine thing

794
01:17:18.125 --> 01:17:20.623
Hell, you might even call it...

795
01:17:20.686 --> 01:17:22.109
What was that?

796
01:17:22.146 --> 01:17:24.732
"Legitimately sublime"

797
01:17:24.982 --> 01:17:28.339
What exactly is this superfine thing?

798
01:17:28.402 --> 01:17:29.700
You're looking at it

799
01:17:29.737 --> 01:17:32.803
It's called time outside of prison, old partner

800
01:17:32.839 --> 01:17:35.368
You can't beat it with a stick

801
01:17:38.205 --> 01:17:43.919
Exactly how much time does $400,000 buy me?

802
01:17:45.588 --> 01:17:48.278
Whatever the market will bear

803
01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:54.076
It'll take me a few days

804
01:17:54.889 --> 01:17:56.688
You got four hours

805
01:17:56.724 --> 01:17:59.436
That's impossible and you know it

806
01:18:00.312 --> 01:18:02.022
Come on, Steve

807
01:18:02.106 --> 01:18:06.798
A man with your rÃ©sumÃ© should come
up with 400 grand in no time

808
01:18:09.864 --> 01:18:11.459
Where?

809
01:18:11.496 --> 01:18:12.998
My place

810
01:18:13.034 --> 01:18:15.765
You don't show up with the cash...

811
01:18:16.746 --> 01:18:20.250
...I'll do a mailing of Steven's greatest hits

812
01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.565
I understand

813
01:18:27.966 --> 01:18:30.782
Make fucking sure you do

814
01:18:59.459 --> 01:19:01.002
Hey, Blondie!

815
01:19:01.378 --> 01:19:02.859
What are you doing here?

816
01:19:03.088 --> 01:19:04.087
Excuse me

817
01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:06.591
I'm looking for apartment 209

818
01:19:14.642 --> 01:19:15.935
This way?

819
01:19:17.561 --> 01:19:18.561
Thank you

820
01:19:25.821 --> 01:19:27.323
There's a blonde coming up

821
01:19:27.948 --> 01:19:28.949
Leave her alone

822
01:19:29.908 --> 01:19:30.908
A blonde?

823
01:19:31.118 --> 01:19:32.369
Send her right up!

824
01:22:18.256 --> 01:22:21.489
That's not happiness to see me, is it?

825
01:22:23.679 --> 01:22:25.577
Try surprise

826
01:22:29.561 --> 01:22:34.420
The key to the dead man's
apartment was on my key chain

827
01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:37.131
Someone put it there after I killed him

828
01:22:37.173 --> 01:22:41.240
And theres only one person
in the world could've done that

829
01:22:41.616 --> 01:22:43.346
Me

830
01:22:43.617 --> 01:22:45.286
Why?

831
01:22:45.327 --> 01:22:47.027
To protect you

832
01:22:47.064 --> 01:22:48.727
From what?

833
01:22:50.667 --> 01:22:52.544
Your lover

834
01:22:54.003 --> 01:22:57.945
Unless somebody else sent these pictures

835
01:23:14.588 --> 01:23:16.882
Oh, my God

836
01:23:17.613 --> 01:23:19.792
Amazing how you know people are in love

837
01:23:19.793 --> 01:23:21.450
even across the street

838
01:23:21.491 --> 01:23:23.848
He called me here two months ago...

839
01:23:23.890 --> 01:23:26.956
...bragged about how you'd fallen for him

840
01:23:26.998 --> 01:23:29.647
I've shelled out over $100,000 already...

841
01:23:29.683 --> 01:23:31.523
...but he wants a lot more

842
01:23:31.559 --> 01:23:33.150
For what?

843
01:23:33.296 --> 01:23:35.528
For breaking it off

844
01:23:37.008 --> 01:23:39.115
I don't believe you

845
01:23:41.514 --> 01:23:43.890
Did he mention Belize?

846
01:23:46.268 --> 01:23:48.875
That's where he took all the other ones

847
01:23:49.772 --> 01:23:54.443
This guy was quite an
aphrodisiac for lonely women of means

848
01:23:54.485 --> 01:23:59.032
He learned to paint at
the State prison... not at Berkeley

849

<i><b>CRIMINAL HISTORY</b></i>

851
01:24:14.674 --> 01:24:16.635
I don't know where
we go from here, Emily

852
01:24:16.677 --> 01:24:20.284
I don't even know
if "we" is an option

853
01:24:20.388 --> 01:24:25.185
I have done everything in my
power to protect you from this...

854
01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:29.732
...career criminal that you've
let crawl into our bed

855
01:24:29.983 --> 01:24:32.088
Why didn't you tell me?

856
01:24:33.361 --> 01:24:35.989
I was sure you
were in love with him

857
01:24:36.322 --> 01:24:38.220
Are you?

858
01:24:40.244 --> 01:24:42.975
I thought that I was

859
01:24:45.374 --> 01:24:49.524
Oh, my God. I can only
imagine what I've put you through

860
01:24:55.134 --> 01:24:57.887
Is this why your business is in trouble?

861
01:24:57.929 --> 01:24:59.660
Trouble?

862
01:24:59.681 --> 01:25:02.684
The banks, margin calls

863
01:25:03.393 --> 01:25:07.919
How did you know...? 
It hasn't helped, no

864
01:25:08.065 --> 01:25:11.026
- But it's true, isn't it?
- Yes, it's true


865
01:25:11.068 --> 01:25:13.284
But I can always make money

866
01:25:13.321 --> 01:25:16.116
There's a goddamn sea of it out there

867
01:25:16.152 --> 01:25:18.660
But there's only one of you

868
01:25:19.577 --> 01:25:23.269
But why did you put
his key on my key chain?

869
01:25:25.792 --> 01:25:28.900
David threatened violence from the very beginning

870
01:25:28.921 --> 01:25:32.862
When I saw the body lying in the kitchen, 
I was sure it was him

871
01:25:33.008 --> 01:25:36.658
No doors had been forced open, so
I assumed that he had your key

872
01:25:36.695 --> 01:25:40.308
But when? I had just used
it to come home that evening

873
01:25:40.767 --> 01:25:44.667
Are you sure you used your key? 
If memory serves me...

874
01:25:44.703 --> 01:25:48.546
...the door was wide open. 
I saw you walk in

875
01:25:48.583 --> 01:25:50.027
Maybe

876
01:25:50.110 --> 01:25:53.322
In which case, he
could've taken your key anytime...

877
01:25:53.359 --> 01:25:58.098
...even the day before. 
Did you see him the day before?

878
01:25:58.119 --> 01:25:59.459
Yes

879
01:25:59.495 --> 01:26:03.834
I searched his pockets, 
I found what I thought was your key...

880
01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:07.566
...and I reacted. 
I grabbed a screwdriver, 
I jimmied the door

881
01:26:07.608 --> 01:26:10.924
I put it in his pocket,
took what I thought was your key...

882
01:26:10.961 --> 01:26:13.657
...and put it on your key chain

883
01:26:13.928 --> 01:26:19.121
Baby, I am so sorry for
having to put you through this

884
01:26:19.184 --> 01:26:21.957
It was the only thing I could do

885
01:26:21.978 --> 01:26:24.251
Can you ever forgive me?

886
01:26:24.355 --> 01:26:27.046
Honey, I already have

887
01:26:33.949 --> 01:26:36.765
We have to go to the police

888
01:26:38.704 --> 01:26:42.375
I don't know if this
is the time for brutal honesty

889
01:26:42.459 --> 01:26:46.004
I mean... I've tampered
with evidence... in a homicide

890
01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:49.633
I paid off a blackmail. 
I'm in over my head and so are you

891
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:53.346
Think it through! 
David could say anything he wants

892
01:26:53.387 --> 01:26:55.889
He could say that I
hired him to kill you

893
01:26:55.926 --> 01:26:59.023
Or that he blackmailed
us, the happy, wealthy couple

894
01:26:59.059 --> 01:27:02.126
It'd appear we killed that
poor bastard, thinking it was David

895
01:27:02.167 --> 01:27:04.253
It depends on how he plays it

896
01:27:04.290 --> 01:27:06.339
What about the man that I killed?

897
01:27:07.319 --> 01:27:09.049
That has to do with David?

898
01:27:09.086 --> 01:27:10.864
Well, it must!

899
01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:16.224
Emily, do you have any idea
how many burglaries there are each day?

900
01:27:16.245 --> 01:27:18.352
I don't think so

901
01:27:22.376 --> 01:27:24.274
What are we going to do now?

902
01:27:24.712 --> 01:27:29.364
We'll have to disentangle
ourselves from your artist friend

903
01:27:30.511 --> 01:27:34.431
Is there anything in his loft that
could link David to you and I?

904
01:27:35.891 --> 01:27:37.648
My ring

905
01:27:37.685 --> 01:27:40.229
You said it was being repaired

906
01:27:40.730 --> 01:27:43.879
That was a lie. 
I left it by the bed

907
01:27:46.235 --> 01:27:48.050
Anything else?

908
01:27:48.238 --> 01:27:50.761
Isn't that enough?

909
01:27:52.785 --> 01:27:54.724
I'll get it

910
01:28:11.596 --> 01:28:14.746
Will you be home when I get back?

911
01:28:14.892 --> 01:28:16.915
Yes

912
01:29:28.972 --> 01:29:30.473
I'm on my way

I don't see why not

920
01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:14.813
Don't think I won't count it

921
01:30:14.849 --> 01:30:16.711
Naturally

922
01:30:18.942 --> 01:30:22.091
Think of that as your commemorative copy

01:35:24.433 --> 01:35:29.068
Just one. It came by messenger, but
your wife took it up with the mail

- Like that?
- Good


955
01:37:35.497 --> 01:37:38.562
I'll be right back. 
I'm going to clean up

956

What doy you think
if we stay home tonight?

958
01:39:22.373 --> 01:39:25.491
I'll go pick up something to eat

959
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:30.266
That's sweet of you. Yeah. 
Just don't be too long.

960
01:39:30.329 --> 01:39:33.561
- I won't
- Ok


961
01:39:33.958 --> 01:39:38.337
Before I forget, 
I think we should have the locks changed

962
01:39:46.346 --> 01:39:47.869
Why?

963
01:39:48.098 --> 01:39:51.038
Because I still can't find my key

964
01:39:54.438 --> 01:39:58.359
Good idea. I'll call

back on his way in

968
01:40:46.578 --> 01:40:49.185
Didn't plan on that, did you?

969
01:40:56.547 --> 01:40:58.799
Young David he was...

970
01:40:59.050 --> 01:41:01.511
...he was very unpredictable

971
01:41:01.552 --> 01:41:04.138
Maybe you'll share a cell

972
01:41:04.972 --> 01:41:06.787
Why?

973
01:41:07.058 --> 01:41:09.039
Because of this?

974
01:41:10.937 --> 01:41:13.419
I just found the key you lost

975
01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:15.880
You left it for him

976
01:41:16.276 --> 01:41:17.736
You mean the man you killed?

977
01:41:17.778 --> 01:41:20.447
- Sorry. I never met the gentleman
- David did


978
01:41:20.489 --> 01:41:22.909
They'll have a hard
time proving I knew David

979
01:41:22.992 --> 01:41:25.453
The blackmail proves it

980
01:41:25.490 --> 01:41:27.059
What blackmail?

981
01:41:27.164 --> 01:41:28.711
There's only one letter...

982
01:41:28.748 --> 01:41:31.376
...and I'm afraid that's vanished

983
01:41:32.669 --> 01:41:35.255
The thing is Emily,
we're just another married couple...

984
01:41:35.506 --> 01:41:38.029
...trying to work things out

985
01:41:38.467 --> 01:41:40.198
Work it out?

986
01:41:40.844 --> 01:41:42.492
Work it out?

987
01:41:44.056 --> 01:41:47.373
<i>Because that's what she does
on nights that I play cards</i>

988
01:41:47.409 --> 01:41:49.875
Like the combination to the safe?

989
01:41:49.912 --> 01:41:52.231
It's our wedding day, Steven

990
01:41:52.774 --> 01:41:57.487
You work it out on
your fucking own! This is over!

991
01:42:01.617 --> 01:42:04.807
I'll tell you when it's over

992
01:42:24.767 --> 01:42:28.458
The only way you leave me is dead

993
01:43:26.542 --> 01:43:32.298
<i>I always thought that
"bludgeon" had a spur-of-the-moment sound</i>

994
01:43:32.444 --> 01:43:35.906
<i>Maybe you could use one of these here</i>

995
01:43:37.637 --> 01:43:40.349
<i>Rifle the jewelry in the bedroom</i>

996
01:43:40.431 --> 01:43:42.413
<i>Disable the service entrance lock</i>

997
01:43:42.414 --> 01:43:44.441
<i>Make it look like it was jimmied</i>

998
01:43:44.478 --> 01:43:46.313
<i>Put the key back under the pipe...</i>

999
01:43:46.355 --> 01:43:48.962
<i>...then leave the same way you came in</i>

1000
01:43:49.692 --> 01:43:53.195
<i>And what happens if
the plan goes to hell?</i>

1001
01:43:54.572 --> 01:43:56.866
<i>It won't</i>

1002
01:44:06.752 --> 01:44:09.171
He said he was going to kill me

1003
01:44:09.588 --> 01:44:11.987
So I tried to run

1004
01:44:12.508 --> 01:44:14.698
And then he attacked you?

1005
01:44:17.138 --> 01:44:18.827
Yes

1006
01:44:21.434 --> 01:44:24.104
What else could you do?

1007
01:44:29.818 --> 01:44:33.301
May God be with you

1008
01:44:33.781 --> 01:44:36.430
And you as well
