00:05:53.941 --> 00:05:56.377
- [Rekesh] Hey,
what's up, cowboy?


12
00:05:58.011 --> 00:05:59.547
- Do I look like a cowboy?

13
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.114
- Yeah, and a scrub.

14
00:06:02.283 --> 00:06:03.551
- Yo, whatcha doing here?

15
00:06:03.584 --> 00:06:05.085
- This is my uncle's store.

16
00:06:05.118 --> 00:06:06.220
- Of course it is.

17
00:06:07.321 --> 00:06:09.624
- Ooh-hoo, racist jokes, huh?

18
00:06:09.657 --> 00:06:12.092
Hey, so tell me why
you so whack in ball?


19
00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:13.528
- Yo, you trash.

20
00:06:13.561 --> 00:06:15.429
- You're just mad
that you can't shoot.


21
00:06:15.463 --> 00:06:17.899
- Look, I know you want
to be like Steph Curry,


22
00:06:17.932 --> 00:06:19.300
but you just curry
goat. [laughing]


23
00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:24.005
Yo, I need you to hook me up.

24
00:06:24.037 --> 00:06:25.006
- Okay.

25
00:06:25.038 --> 00:06:26.941
I give you 10, give me 11.

26
00:06:26.974 --> 00:06:28.409
- Nah, man, for real.

27
00:06:29.377 --> 00:06:30.811
I don't got any money on me.

28
00:06:30.845 --> 00:06:32.213
I need something to eat.

29
00:06:34.882 --> 00:06:35.783
Yo, I really need it, man.

30
00:06:35.816 --> 00:06:37.050
- [Rekesh] There's cameras.

31
00:06:37.083 --> 00:06:39.520
- You think your uncle's
watching these cameras?


32
00:06:40.388 --> 00:06:42.490
This'll just be between us, man.

33
00:06:45.192 --> 00:06:46.494
- I don't know, man.

34
00:06:48.396 --> 00:06:51.399
- Aight, look, if
you hook me up,


35
00:06:51.432 --> 00:06:54.335
next time I see you at the
park, I'll play you 1-on-1.

39
00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:08.182
And you don't have to
be gentle with him.


40
00:07:08.215 --> 00:07:10.418
- [Chad] He gets
dropped in the lobby.


41
00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:12.553
- No, that's not going to work.

42
00:07:12.587 --> 00:07:14.622
- [Chad] You can
bring him up yourself.


43
00:07:17.592 --> 00:07:18.626
- You know what?

44
00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:20.304
I'll just have my assistant
Melissa take care of it.


45
00:07:20.328 --> 00:07:22.630
I mean, [chuckles] how
hard could it be, right?


46
00:07:24.332 --> 00:07:27.735
- Full payment in
cash before the job.


47
00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:30.471
- No way. It's not happening.

[muted, upbeat music]

49
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.481
- [Robert] Who is that?

50
00:07:41.482 --> 00:07:43.284
- [Melissa] It's a
personal meeting.


51
00:07:44.685 --> 00:07:45.686
- Oh.

52
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.727
Oh, do you have the
weekly reports for me?


53
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.828
- Oh...

54
00:07:53.861 --> 00:07:55.529
I am so sorry, sir.

55
00:07:55.563 --> 00:07:58.065
But I can bring them by your
house on my way home tonight.


56
00:07:58.099 --> 00:08:00.001
- No. It's okay.

57
00:08:00.034 --> 00:08:01.636
It's not that important.

58
00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:04.972
My brother should not have you
bringing work to our house.


59
00:08:05.006 --> 00:08:07.074
Our father would never
have allowed that.


60
00:08:07.108 --> 00:08:09.176
- I can wire you the money.

61
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.478
- I said cash.

62
00:08:12.713 --> 00:08:15.950
- It's a fake kidnapping for
a surprise birthday party.


63
00:08:15.983 --> 00:08:17.551
It's not a drug deal.

64
00:08:17.585 --> 00:08:20.321
- [Chad] Good luck
finding someone else.


65
00:08:20.354 --> 00:08:22.890
- I'm just doing
what is asked of me.


66
00:08:22.923 --> 00:08:24.525
I appreciate your concern.

67
00:08:26.727 --> 00:08:28.596
- Good night.

68
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:29.730
- Good night, sir.

69
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.701
- Fine.

70
00:08:35.069 --> 00:08:36.270
Deal.

74
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.461
Doesn't break character.

75
00:09:01.629 --> 00:09:03.764
- Here's the paperwork
you asked about earlier.


76
00:09:05.132 --> 00:09:07.001
- Why do you wear
that every day?


77
00:09:07.034 --> 00:09:08.536
- What? This?

78
00:09:08.569 --> 00:09:10.805
- Yeah, it looks like a
five-year-old made it.


79
00:09:10.838 --> 00:09:13.841
[Melissa chuckles]
- It's from someone special.


80
00:09:13.874 --> 00:09:14.874
It reminds me of home.

81
00:09:15.843 --> 00:09:17.244
Nothing like yours.

82
00:09:18.612 --> 00:09:21.982
- This? This is actually
my favorite watch.


83
00:09:23.384 --> 00:09:24.728
You didn't tell anyone
about the surprise, did you?


84
00:09:24.752 --> 00:09:25.786
- Of course not.

85
00:09:26.921 --> 00:09:27.921
- Okay, good.

89
00:09:39.867 --> 00:09:41.235
- You home?

90
00:09:41.268 --> 00:09:42.770
- Yeah.

[phone buzzing]

what do you want?


94
00:10:20.274 --> 00:10:21.876
- What's up, ugly?

95
00:10:21.909 --> 00:10:22.943
- [Shannon] Ugly?

96
00:10:22.977 --> 00:10:24.011
Do you own a mirror?

97
00:10:24.044 --> 00:10:26.747
- Bruh, I got mirrors for days.

98
00:10:26.781 --> 00:10:27.882
Yo, listen up.

99
00:10:27.915 --> 00:10:29.850
We got a meeting in an hour.

100
00:10:29.884 --> 00:10:31.186
- Aight.

101
00:10:31.219 --> 00:10:32.419
Say no more.

- [Shannon] You
always chilling, man.


107
00:11:25.372 --> 00:11:27.074
- Yeah, better than working.

108
00:11:27.107 --> 00:11:28.375
- Psh, whatever.

109
00:11:28.409 --> 00:11:29.211
Ayo, can I grab
something to drink?


110
00:11:29.244 --> 00:11:30.578
I had to rush over here.

111
00:11:30.611 --> 00:11:32.980
- Yeah man, it's cool.
I know you're broke.


112
00:11:33.013 --> 00:11:34.114
Ooh!

113
00:11:34.148 --> 00:11:35.983
I get community service
credit for this.


114
00:11:36.016 --> 00:11:38.752
- Yo, broke? Never that.

115
00:11:38.786 --> 00:11:40.921
- Okay. [chuckles]

116
00:11:43.157 --> 00:11:45.593
Oh my gosh, bro.

117
00:11:45.626 --> 00:11:46.627
Dude...

118
00:11:48.062 --> 00:11:49.630
Yo, check this out.

119
00:11:49.663 --> 00:11:52.132
So this girl hasn't
responded to a single text


120
00:11:52.167 --> 00:11:53.467
in six months, right?

121
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.337
- Yeah?
- I ain't heard nothing back.


122
00:11:55.369 --> 00:11:56.804
But...

123
00:11:56.837 --> 00:12:00.140
she will like literally every
single photo I post, bro.


124
00:12:01.609 --> 00:12:03.477
Our generation is hopeless, man.

125
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:08.216
Bro, Kobe Bryant was the
greatest of all time,


126
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.984
AKA the GOAT.

127
00:12:10.017 --> 00:12:11.652
He had five rings.

128
00:12:11.685 --> 00:12:12.729
He had the second most points

129
00:12:12.753 --> 00:12:16.291
in any NBA game in history, 81.

130
00:12:16.324 --> 00:12:18.025
He's a gold medal- 
- Hold on.

131
00:12:18.058 --> 00:12:20.228
Six rings, alright?

132
00:12:20.262 --> 00:12:22.396
Multiple defensive
player of the year.


133
00:12:22.429 --> 00:12:24.565
Literally the GOAT.

134
00:12:24.598 --> 00:12:26.210
Michael Jordan. What
are you talking about?


135
00:12:26.234 --> 00:12:27.510
- Your opinion is
isn't even valid, bro.


136
00:12:27.534 --> 00:12:28.678
- How is my opinion not valid?

137
00:12:28.702 --> 00:12:31.939
- You're a Knicks
fan, bro! [laughs]


138
00:12:31.972 --> 00:12:33.407
It's okay.

139
00:12:34.175 --> 00:12:35.253
There's always next season.

140
00:12:35.277 --> 00:12:37.077
- [Shannon] Whatever.

141
00:12:37.111 --> 00:12:38.712
- We got a job next Tuesday.

142
00:12:39.914 --> 00:12:42.217
We're kidnapping a CEO for
a surprise birthday party.


143
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.319
- Nah, you gotta be joking.

144
00:12:44.352 --> 00:12:46.086
- Wait, can I be
the clown? Please?


145
00:12:47.421 --> 00:12:49.490
- First we secure him,
then we go for his safe.


146
00:12:49.523 --> 00:12:52.826
- See, now why didn't you
just say that from the jump?


147
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.771
- Yeah wait, hold up. Who
are we even kidnapping?


148
00:12:54.795 --> 00:12:56.730
- The target is Robert Chang.

149
00:12:56.764 --> 00:12:58.165
His brother William hired us.

150
00:12:59.833 --> 00:13:01.101
- Robert Chang?

151
00:13:01.135 --> 00:13:02.380
Why does that sound so familiar?

152
00:13:02.404 --> 00:13:03.871
- [Shannon] Chang Imports.

153
00:13:05.307 --> 00:13:08.108
Yo, I know that family got bank.

154
00:13:11.478 --> 00:13:12.680
I needed this.

155
00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:19.086
- This is it for me.

156
00:13:19.119 --> 00:13:20.721
- [Shannon] What?

157
00:13:20.754 --> 00:13:22.589
But you never even got caught...

158
00:13:23.757 --> 00:13:26.026

were all in this together.

that serious, bro.


658
00:53:48.383 --> 00:53:50.917
- It's just a little
piece of paper, bro.


659
00:53:50.951 --> 00:53:52.720
Dude, we just robbed a joint.

660
00:53:52.754 --> 00:53:54.489
A little piece of paper
falls on the ground,


661
00:53:54.522 --> 00:53:56.557
it's not a tragedy, man.

662
00:53:56.591 --> 00:53:57.792
What?
- Word, yo.


663
00:53:57.825 --> 00:53:59.102
- Stop.
- Yeah, you feel me, though?


664
00:53:59.126 --> 00:54:02.296
Like, that's so funny, dude.

665
00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:04.732
Justin, you get funnier
every day, bro, I swear.


666
00:54:04.766 --> 00:54:06.200
You got these little ticks, man.

667
00:54:06.234 --> 00:54:08.169
- Stop it.
- Freakin' A, bro.


668
00:54:08.202 --> 00:54:09.446
I bet he goes home,
he's got these little

pieces of paper lined up,

670
00:54:10.772 --> 00:54:12.206
does origami with each one.

671
00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.517
He got little cranes,
you know what I'm saying.


672
00:54:13.541 --> 00:54:15.252
- [Shannon] Aight, yo,
chill. Let it go, man.


673
00:54:15.276 --> 00:54:16.787
- [Todd] Bro, he throws it
at the trash can but doesn't


674
00:54:16.811 --> 00:54:18.679
make it in, ruins his whole day.

675
00:54:18.713 --> 00:54:20.914
- Yeah, man.
- You know what I mean, bro?

[laughing]

677

That's not OCD, bro.

I'm telling you bro, I
swear. [shrill ringing]

Yo, what's good?

683
00:54:51.612 --> 00:54:52.814
- Everything's a joke to you.

684
00:54:52.847 --> 00:54:54.014
- What?

685
00:54:54.047 --> 00:54:55.583
- I can't baby you
anymore. Grow up.


686
00:54:55.616 --> 00:54:57.083
- Nobody asked you to.

687
00:54:57.117 --> 00:54:58.952
- You can't do
anything on your own.


688
00:54:58.985 --> 00:55:00.188
- What, you think I need you?

689
00:55:00.221 --> 00:55:01.389
I'm by myself all the time.

690
00:55:01.422 --> 00:55:02.932
I live with a freakin'
zombie for a brother!


691
00:55:02.956 --> 00:55:04.826
- You think I like doing this?

692
00:55:04.859 --> 00:55:06.928
You think I'm proud of these?

693

Me and him are at war everyday!

Yo bro.

- Aight.

706
00:58:00.468 --> 00:58:03.671

I got a big hole in my couch.


707
00:58:03.704 --> 00:58:05.239
I'm just saying.

you mean to tell me


716
00:59:58.186 --> 00:59:59.620
you didn't know them beforehand?

717
01:00:11.332 --> 01:00:13.367
How'd you come in
contact with them?


718
01:00:21.142 --> 01:00:23.477
So we have to figure
out how they found you.


719
01:00:24.879 --> 01:00:25.879
Trace it back.

720
01:00:34.755 --> 01:00:37.892
We can't go back in
time. Let's move forward.

Backtrack.

kids are mad good.

I got these five-year-olds
that'll give you buckets, bro.

Yo Shannon, tell him.

know he trash.

Yeah man, you got
this goofy shot.

Looks like you're
taking a deuce.

Okay, cowboy?

smack the fire out you, man.

right, keep walking.

You're lucky this

about this for the past month.

01:04:38.832 --> 01:04:39.800
Do you want to hold my hand?

753
01:04:39.833 --> 01:04:41.969
- Aye yo, stop playin', man.

754
01:04:42.002 --> 01:04:44.047
You need like a girlfriend or
something to occupy your mind.

- Nah, man.

you going to do with your cut?


760
01:05:31.785 --> 01:05:33.388
- Probably going to
buy me a new crib.

and new boots!

Just open the door.

Tell me about this chick
that was texting you.

01:05:45.333 --> 01:05:47.801
So she texted me.

[tense music]

769
01:06:07.087 --> 01:06:08.532
- [Todd] She changed her
number six months ago,


770
01:06:08.556 --> 01:06:10.291
so that's why I wasn't
hearing nothing back.

- Oh.
- I was playing hard to get

So where's my stuff?

Look, all I want is my
watch and the envelope.

That's it.

I don't think you understand
what those things mean to me.

all, and I can forgive him.

Now, man, we gotta go.

Yo, we gotta go, now.

01:10:57.278 --> 01:10:59.313
from the moment mom brought
you into this world,


819
01:10:59.347 --> 01:11:02.517
you have given me
unimaginable joy.


820
01:11:04.252 --> 01:11:06.953
You've surpassed
all my expectations


821
01:11:06.987 --> 01:11:09.590
without any of my shortcomings.

822
01:11:10.957 --> 01:11:14.529
Robbie, keep making me proud.

823
01:11:14.562 --> 01:11:15.596
I love you.

824
01:11:17.498 --> 01:11:18.533
Dear William,

825
01:11:19.867 --> 01:11:23.371
I'm sorry that your
mother left us so soon.


826
01:11:23.404 --> 01:11:28.576
She understood you in all
the ways I refused to.


827
01:11:30.311 --> 01:11:34.182
The truth is, I used
to be more like you.


828
01:11:35.650 --> 01:11:38.286
Grandpa was a man of tradition,

829
01:11:38.319 --> 01:11:42.490
so I conformed to
gain his respect.


830
01:11:44.358 --> 01:11:48.529
I'm sorry I didn't
accept you as you are.


831
01:11:50.698 --> 01:11:55.670
Will, I'm proud
of you for having


832
01:11:56.571 --> 01:11:58.473
more courage than I ever had.

833
01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:02.777
I love you more
than life itself.


834
01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:05.379
I've amended the inheritance.

835
01:12:06.481 --> 01:12:08.516
Everything is now equal.

836
01:12:11.219 --> 01:12:14.988
Please forgive me and make
amends with your brother.


837
01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:20.461
I am so blessed to
have two unique sons.


838
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:25.633
Be not afraid of growing slowly.

839
01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:31.639
Love, dad. [melancholy

840
01:12:50.825 --> 01:12:53.093
- [William] I'm so sorry.

844
01:14:00.761 --> 01:14:02.363
My watch.

[soft, mysterious music]

846
01:14:17.478 --> 01:14:19.380
I might have something for you.

847
01:14:21.549 --> 01:14:22.826
- We need to know
where everything is


848
01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:24.652
or we won't be able to help you.

849
01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:27.388
- [Melissa] Sir.

850
01:14:29.223 --> 01:14:30.791
- [Robert] Perfect.

851
01:14:31.926 --> 01:14:35.529
[soft, mysterious music]

852
01:14:52.179 --> 01:14:54.782
- He made a
huge deal out of it.

853
01:14:54.815 --> 01:14:56.784
- That doesn't change the plan.

854
01:14:56.817 --> 01:14:57.818
- Okay.

855
01:14:59.020 --> 01:14:59.987
I love you.

856
01:15:00.021 --> 01:15:02.823
- [Robert] Call the cops!

857
01:15:02.857 --> 01:15:03.858
- Here, hold this.

858
01:15:05.559 --> 01:15:07.695
- [Melissa] No,
wait. It's okay.


859
01:15:07.728 --> 01:15:09.764
We don't need to
call the cops, okay?


860
01:15:10.698 --> 01:15:12.733
- Do you want to
see your son again?


861
01:15:12.767 --> 01:15:14.869
Because that's what
you're up against.


862
01:15:18.773 --> 01:15:19.774
- That's all I know.

863
01:15:21.208 --> 01:15:22.719
- You're going to be
under surveillance.


864
01:15:22.743 --> 01:15:25.312
I wouldn't leave your
house for any reason.
