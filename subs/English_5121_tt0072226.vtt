- Clovis Poplin. I'm his wife, Lou Jean.

Poplin. Let's see.

- Here we go. So he did. It's on my flimsy.

Some nice goodies in here?

Oh, let's see. What's this?

7

That's Texas Gold Stamps

OK. What we got in this one?

10
00:03:48.197 --> 00:03:53.617
All right, Mrs. Poplin. Have yourself a real
nice visit. I think the JCs have lemonade.


11

No, I ain't. Why didn't you bring him?

There's kids allowed.
They got candy for 'em and pop.

I'm not behind bars in despair.
You can bring him every week.

That's what I come to tell ya. Welfare's
come and taken Baby Langston forever.

- How am I supposed to know?

They had me fill out
a statement of propriety

and take it to the county courthouse,
but it was closed.


47

to the hall of records,


48

what I was talkin' about.

Then I remembered what you said
about the telephone.


50
00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:40.173
So I called the man up, got him on the
line, and that didn't do no good neither


51
00:06:40.264 --> 00:06:44.427
because he said the man at the first place
should've sent it to my address.


52
00:06:44.517 --> 00:06:48.728
But that didn't do no good
cos I'd already moved by that time.

- I can't. This is an emergency.

On the day in question how long had your
man here been with the highway patrol?


302
00:27:02.328 --> 00:27:04.948
It was three years,
unless I'm mistaken.


303
00:27:05.038 --> 00:27:11.122
Had it ever come to your attention that
he was having difficulty with his vision?


304
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:12.324
No, sir.

305
00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:17.167
Don't highway patrolmen have to have
regular physical examinations


306
00:27:17.257 --> 00:27:19.748
- and examinations of your eyes?
- Yes, sir.

All highway patrol personnel undergo a
thorough medical examination every year.

Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.

309
00:27:28.976 --> 00:27:31.217
- Captain Tanner.
- Yes, sir.

If you would, Your Honor.

311

Gentlemen, we have an emergency.
May I see counsel in chambers?


312
00:27:43.362 --> 00:27:45.320
We stand adjourned.

313
00:27:45.407 --> 00:27:47.612
All rise!

314
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:52.611

316
00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:11.048
2590 to Houston.
This is Captain Tanner.


317

Believe our man is hijacked.
Repeat: Hijacked.


318
00:28:17.559 --> 00:28:22.268
Have all units stay off the A channel
as much as possible.


319
00:28:22.355 --> 00:28:25.806
No need them knowin'

320
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:30.193
I want a roadblock on 90 Alternate

327
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:58.436
Put that shotgun on this officer here

<i>(Slide) That's my captain.</i>

<i>They hurt you any, Maxwell?</i>

335
00:30:24.712 --> 00:30:28.412
I'm sorry about this, Captain.
I had no idea they were 96s.


336
00:30:28.507 --> 00:30:32.255
What you talkin', 32, 96?
You tryin' to code me out?


337
00:30:32.343 --> 00:30:34.419
No, sir. It is a verbal shorthand.

338
00:30:34.511 --> 00:30:38.426
10-32 is a man with a gun.

339
00:30:38.516 --> 00:30:41.351
- How do you work this?
- To talk, press the button.

We ain't no mental subjects!

<i>What's your name, son?</i>

344

What are you doin'
with our man in there?


345
00:30:58.492 --> 00:31:02.619
He's just takin' us to Sugarland
to get my boy Langston.


346
00:31:03.662 --> 00:31:07.281
You sure got a strange notion
on how to hitchhike.


347
00:31:07.375 --> 00:31:09.450
Y'all stay back, no need to worry.

348
00:31:09.542 --> 00:31:12.460
Now get your cars back.
Quit followin' us!


349

I've got a job to do.

350
00:31:14.297 --> 00:31:17.711
I can't have old boys
commandeerin' my patrol cars.


351
00:31:17.799 --> 00:31:19.459
What would the taxpayers say?

352
00:31:19.551 --> 00:31:22.967
Get on back
or I'll shoot him in the head!


353
00:31:25.891 --> 00:31:28.974
Take it easy
and think about what you're doin'.


354
00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:32.393
<i>No one's gonna get hurt.
Do you hear me?</i>


355
00:31:34.065 --> 00:31:36.601
<i>We'll get you out of this, Maxwell.</i>

356
00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:44.522
We've got a bad hombre here.
We're gonna have to lift that roadblock.


357
00:31:44.614 --> 00:31:48.279
Houston, let 'em all know to back off
and let that boy through.

Here they come.
Get that car out of the hole!


359

Donny Hyatt and Bill Fails ain't
runnin' around. They's just beerin'.


442
00:40:51.883 --> 00:40:54.966
Suspicions of marital infidelity
are often groundless,


443

but the ensuin' disputes are destructive.

- Yeah, why'd you have to come along?

I still wouldn't quit no job for you.

- We don't just chase speeders all day.
- Mind your own goddamn business.


449
00:41:16.988 --> 00:41:20.606
What you wanna hang around
Donny and Bill for? They're idiots.


450
00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.906
They'll call you promiscuous and unfit.

451
00:41:22.994 --> 00:41:26.492
In the three years we've been married,
I haven't even had the urge.


452
00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.782
And I am not promiscuous
and I am not unfit, neither!

Oh, he was two in January.

That's some ride, huh?

656
01:00:46.923 --> 01:00:48.631
Mr. Sparrow, your influence

657
01:00:48.717 --> 01:00:52.761
might persuade your daughter

- You'll make it.


737
01:08:18.150 --> 01:08:20.475
- Did you bring the coffee?
- Black and hot.


738
01:08:20.569 --> 01:08:22.645
Great.

739
01:08:44.381 --> 01:08:46.504
Did you do that?

740
01:08:46.592 --> 01:08:49.046
I had to.

741
01:08:49.134 --> 01:08:51.258
You're in real trouble.

742
01:08:56.433 --> 01:08:58.924
- Thank you.
- Jean, you decent?


743
01:09:07.401 --> 01:09:10.355
Propane. Nice.

744
01:09:10.446 --> 01:09:12.522
Y'all decent?

745
01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:21.620
I'm gonna go pick one out.
Don't you guys get to dawdlin'.

747
01:09:40.722 --> 01:09:43.130
Does that old razor belong to you?

748
01:09:43.224 --> 01:09:45.430
Sure do. Wanna use it?

749
01:09:45.518 --> 01:09:47.594
Yeah, when you're done.

750
01:09:49.687 --> 01:09:52.606
How much money you make
on the highway patrol?


751
01:09:52.690 --> 01:09:54.897
Not a whole lot, let me tell ya.

752
01:09:54.984 --> 01:09:58.068
- How much is that?
- $620 a month.


753
01:09:58.153 --> 01:10:00.727
<i>- But I take home a lot less.
- (electric razor)</i>


754
01:10:00.823 --> 01:10:02.815
I didn't mean what I said.

755
01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:04.401
What was that?

756
01:10:04.492 --> 01:10:09.036
About callin' you a son of a bitch.
I didn't mean that.


757
01:10:09.121 --> 01:10:12.739
And you ain't no mental subject, neither.

758
01:10:14.335 --> 01:10:19.162
I've been thinkin' about
gettin' on the highway patrol.


759
01:10:20.965 --> 01:10:26.006
They won't take a man with a record.
I think it's a state law.


760
01:10:27.138 --> 01:10:29.842
<i>(Lou Jean) Honey, 
I found one!</i>

762
01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:35.886
Honey?

763
01:10:35.978 --> 01:10:40.356
Just supposin' that I were to tell you
that this is the end of the line.


764
01:10:42.693 --> 01:10:46.357
Just supposin' I told you
I wasn't gonna go no further.


765
01:10:47.531 --> 01:10:49.688
- What?
- Just supposin'!


766
01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.109
Now, you may kill me,

767
01:10:53.202 --> 01:10:56.451
but if you don't come to your senses
and throw it down,


768

<i>they're gonna kill you.</i>

769
01:11:00.708 --> 01:11:04.042
Well, supposin' 
I was worried about that.

770
01:11:04.127 --> 01:11:06.204
Which I'm not!

771
01:11:06.297 --> 01:11:12.084
And supposin' I was to give myself up.
How many years'd I get for breakin' out?


772
01:11:12.176 --> 01:11:16.339
I couldn't tell you but it might go real easy
bein' as how you're a regular fella.


773
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:20.297
<i>Well, I am a regular fella!
I never shot a man.</i>


774
01:11:20.392 --> 01:11:23.643
There you go!
That's a major point with the law.


775
01:11:23.728 --> 01:11:25.851
<i>Make you mighty happy, I bet ya.</i>

776
01:11:25.939 --> 01:11:28.181
Hell, yes.
It'd make everybody happy!


777
01:11:28.275 --> 01:11:31.773
Well, where are you two?
It's already sunup.


778
01:11:31.861 --> 01:11:35.395
<i>Not Lou Jean.
It wouldn't make her happy.</i>


779
01:11:36.907 --> 01:11:40.489
Man, they'd lock me up
from now to Moses.


780
01:11:40.577 --> 01:11:44.704
Take away my boy for good.
They'll change his name.


781
01:11:46.415 --> 01:11:48.491
All right, stand up.

782
01:11:49.751 --> 01:11:51.542
Stand up!

783
01:11:51.627 --> 01:11:53.371
Nobody move. I made up my mind.

784
01:11:53.463 --> 01:11:57.625
We're gonna take this one.
It's the best one on the lot.


785
01:12:02.846 --> 01:12:07.305
Don't let that squelch fool you.
We're not the only ones out here.


786
01:12:07.391 --> 01:12:10.013
- Maybe they already caught 'em.
- No way.


787
01:12:10.102 --> 01:12:14.810
I had my home set on all night.
Wasn't anything on the APB about it.


788
01:12:14.898 --> 01:12:18.432
You all know what I think
about the airborne.


789
01:12:21.903 --> 01:12:24.275
Dad, they're in Big John's!

790
01:12:29.369 --> 01:12:34.955
After you scrape off the insulation, bring it
from your hot line to your coil over here.


791
01:12:35.041 --> 01:12:38.160
Make sure you don't get
your fingers on the metal.


792
01:12:38.252 --> 01:12:40.410
I need somethin' to short over the starter.

793
01:12:40.504 --> 01:12:44.453
- What about your badge?
- Yeah, that'll work.


794
01:12:53.056 --> 01:12:55.547
You got water in the gas line.

795
01:12:57.769 --> 01:12:59.926
You run lights and appliances all night?

<i>Y'all come on in.
Just tell everyone I told you that.</i>


848
01:18:29.892 --> 01:18:32.642
Let's all back off
a step or two, men.

849
01:18:33.603 --> 01:18:36.437
No need for hasty talk around here.

850
01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:44.899
All right, Clovis.
You got yourself a deal.


851
01:18:44.988 --> 01:18:49.898
Sounds like a fair proposition to me
and I'm gonna abide by it.


852

But no more runnin' off,
no more speedin', and no more guns.

We're gonna get the baby.

858
01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:23.645
Captain Tanner,
I do believe you're a good man.

Yeah?

861
01:19:59.302 --> 01:20:04.213
You ain't really gonna let 'em
take that baby, are you?


862
01:20:04.307 --> 01:20:06.797
I don't see how we can.

863
01:20:11.855 --> 01:20:14.524
Do you want me to go somewheres?

864
01:20:14.606 --> 01:20:17.014
Yeah.

865
01:20:17.109 --> 01:20:19.778
Go find those two old boys
that was with you.

868
01:20:24.782 --> 01:20:27.024
Yeah, Fenno and Waters.

869
01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:34.164
Find them, take the chopper,
and get on over to the foster home.


870
01:20:34.249 --> 01:20:36.325
Yes, sir.

871
01:20:46.843 --> 01:20:49.002
I'm real sorry, Captain.

872
01:20:50.347 --> 01:20:52.422
Yeah.

873
01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:11.819
Don't let me see you around here again.

- But, Captain...
- Shut up!


875
01:21:14.283 --> 01:21:19.325
These boys ain't reserves. They ain't been
on the active list for more than a year.


876
01:21:19.414 --> 01:21:21.620
Is that right?

877
01:21:53.026 --> 01:21:55.102
Take that with you!

878
01:21:57.864 --> 01:22:00.534

Hey, that was it!
What are you doin'?!

Just look round you, for Christ's sake.
