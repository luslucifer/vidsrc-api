00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.590
CHILDREN OF IRENA SENDLER

2
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.510
ln the memory of all the known and unknown
who are, ''Righteous Among the Nations''.


3
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.600
Yes?

4
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.430
Yes.

5
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.580
Yes, l will come right away.

6
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.550
l will walk, so twenty minutes.

7
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.640
Please, stay calm.

8
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.490
Irenka?

9
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.620
lt's all right, Mama.
Go back to sleep.


10
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.530
- Thank God, you are here.
- Where is she?


11
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.600
ln the cupboard.

12
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.440
Tonight, when Krzysztof came home
the way our neighbours looked at him


13
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.450
we were betrayed. l just know.
l'm sorry, Irena.


14
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.560
lf the Germans find us hiding a Jew,
they will shoot us.


15
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.570
Hello, Anna, it's Irena.

16
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.630
You do not need to be afraid.
And tonight...


17
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.580
you will stay with me.

18
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.660
Would you like that?

19
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.560
How many mothers do you have?

20
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.460
l just have one.

21
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.470
Already, l had three.

22
00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.590
Shh.

23
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.530
Why do they not like me?

24
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.530
Who does not like you?

25
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.660
My mothers.

26
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.450
Your mothers love you.
And l love you.


27
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.500
And l will always love you.

28
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.480
Go to sleep.

29
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.600
- We have to go now.
- Here.


30
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.620
lt is safe to take
her out in broad daylight?


31
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.450
She looks like one of us.
Are you worried?


32
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.440
Not one bit.

33
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.540
Mama, hmm?

34
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.430
- Ahh, good.
- Eva will love it.


35
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.480
lt's perfect.

36
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.540
Mama! Take your medicine.

37
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.550
Mama, please.

38
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.590
You are so funny.
You're a wonderful girl.


39
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.580
The second doll with the long
locks was called Bella.


40
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:06.600
Come in Anna!

41
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.450
Anna, this is Miss Jadwiga.

42
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.450
Hello, sweetie.
Come in.


43
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.620
Thank you. Come in.

44
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.630
Anna, you can play with
Miss Jadwiga's children while


45
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.490
l find you a lovely place to live.
You're a good girl.


46
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.590
- Take care of her.
- Hello, sweetie.


47
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.510
She has passed outside the ghetto
all this time. There must be


48
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.630
- a Polish family who can take her.
- Not any we know personally.


49
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.580
l'll ask father Godlewski
he will know some we can trust.


50
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.530
- Wait. You mean now?
- His soup kitchen's on my way.


51
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.640
- You're going to the Ghetto?
- Yes. l will see you later.


52
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.580
Get out of here.

53
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.560
Irena Sendler, you work?

54
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.580
Department of Social Services.

55
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.580
l see that, my question is about today,
why are you here?


56
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.600
Inspection of the refugee centers.
Prevent the spread of typhus.


57
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.560
You Poles must solve this problem,
it's a disgrace.


58
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.500
Go in.

59
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.590
Next please, documents.

60
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.500
Only bread today, take it.
Go.


61
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.540
l told you once
l won't tell you again.


62
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.430
You're not hungry?

63
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.590
Please, please buy it from me.

64
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.490
Father Godlewski. Good morning.

65
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.620
Ah, Irena.

66
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.660
What do you hear?

67
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:38.480
ln the last two weeks, they have filled
train cars of Jews in Luxemburg and


68
00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:42.460
Vienna, deported them all
to the ghetto in Lodz - and here,


69
00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.580
every day they bring more.

70
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.620
You know we are doing all we can to
help Jews survive outside the ghetto.


71
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.560
- Yes, l know, very well.
- And today l have a little girl


72
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:59.440
- and no Polish family to hide her.
- It's not easy for Poles either.


73
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.580
- Perhaps in your congregation?
-Irena, please...


74
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.590
...of all people you know
the risk for a Polish family.


75
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:10.440
Even so, is it not possible there are
some or even many Poles who want


76
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.440
to help but don't know how?

77
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.530
Yes, yes, yes. 
It is possible.

78
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:38.640
Eva.

79
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:40.540
Irena.

80
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.610
Come, come.

81
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.650
- Good morning, Hannah.
- Oh, Irenka.


82
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.520
Always such a faithful friend.

83
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:54.660
God bless you.

84
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:56.560
Rabbi Rozenfeld.

85
00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.550
Dear Irena, how are you this fine day?

86
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.470
ls this work for a Rabbi?

87
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:05.590
We all must live with dignity,
especially in days of hatred.


88
00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.570
Miss Irena! Miss Irena!

89
00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.650
Karolyna! Or should l say, the famous
Miss Nijinska, Prima ballerina?


90
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.470
Do you know what l learned to do!
Do you want to see?


91
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.430
Of course, you must show me!

92
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.550
Brava!

93
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.430
- How is your mother?
- Well enough, if she behaves.


94
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.590
- And your Jacob?
- Last week he came back into


95
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.440
- the Ghetto to hug his daughter.
- And to kiss you, l'm sure.


96
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.480
Maybe yes, a little.

97
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.420
l brought a few things.

98
00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:46.540
Let me, let me!

99
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:50.620
And this.

100
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.570
Irena, what do we have here?

101
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.570
You made this?

102
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.540
Can you imagine me putting
two stitches together?


103
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.640
- Then your mother.
- She misses you.


104
00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.490
So do l.

105
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.590
My dearest friends in the whole world.

106
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.650
Please thank her.

107
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.650
Eva, l need to talk with you.

108
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.630
Over the last few weeks,
they have deported freight cars


109
00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.560
of Jews from Austria to
the ghetto in Lodz.


110
00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.420
We heard last night. The Jewish Council
says they will send to workcamps.


111
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.540
Eva, your Jewish Council was appointed by
Germans. How many years have we listened to


112
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.580
their terrible propaganda? What they say
about Jews, what they say


113
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.610
- they have in mind...
- It's just talk, rumor.


114
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.570
Who can believe it? These are
cultured people. Anyway, we're


115
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:05.570
almost five hundred thousand in this
Ghetto. What could they do?


116
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.540
Yes, yes... l know.

117
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.440
lt's so confusing.

118
00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:33.510
One day somebody says something
is true, another says it's not.


119
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.430
Every day l wake
up, my body is cold.

120
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.460
We have to get
you all out of here.

121
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.620
They would never leave.
l could never leave them.


122
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:44.660
l can find Polish families
willing to hide you.


123
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.560
Most people believe it's better
to stay all together, inside the wall.


124
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.430
l want you safe...

125
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.510
- ...all of you.
- Irena, what is safe?


126
00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:57.590
Where?

127
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.630
Good morning, Miss Irena.

128
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.600
Good morning, Doctor Majkowski,
have you had a chance to consider my--


129
00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:13.450
Yes, l have selected your friend,
Maria Debinska to join your department.


130
00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:14.560
Thank you, doctor.

131
00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:19.590
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Irena.


132
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:23.450
Maria, welcome to our little
department, thank you.


133
00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:24.540
My thanks to you.

134
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.620
- Good morning, Miss Irena.
- You missed an exciting meeting.


135
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.530
Issued today, the new ration card.

136
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:42.460
2613 calories a day for Germans,

137
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.510
300 calories for residents of the
ghetto.


138
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.520
So we will have starvation along
with a Typhus epidemic.


139
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.460
And winter almost here.

140
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.650
We'll need to bring in food,
clothing, medicine - Maria,


141
00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.570
talk to Doctor Majkowski, see how
much Typhus vaccine you can get.


142
00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.660
Since The Occupation Jadwiga
has done a brilliant job of trying


143
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:02.600
to balance an impossible
budget.


144
00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:04.440
But...

145
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.600
But, if we continue to spread our
services over every district in Warsaw,


146
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.660
we will not be helping anyone.

147
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.580
From now on we must focus
our full attention on the ghetto.


148
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.520
Excuse me, Miss Irena.
The Jewish Quarter is not our problem.


149
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.650
Why not?

150
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.450
The Germans put them
there to protect us.


151
00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:28.580
Protect us from what?

152
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.500
Maria, you are a nurse,
you know very well.


153
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.540
What do l know, tell me?

154
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.640
They have lice, spread disease and...

155
00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.490
You know what l'm talking about.

156
00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:45.550
Danuta, how can half a million cramped
people stay in good health.


157
00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.500
One reason, another reason
what does it matter.


158
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:57.570
All l know is l am not going to bring
Typhus home to my family.


159
00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:59.590
Whatever it is you're thinking,

160
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:04.440
l am sorry - l
can't be part of it.

161
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.440
Anyone else who does
not agree with this direction,


162
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.560
l will arrange a department transfer.

163
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.420
Stefania, you have only been
with us two months.


164
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.520
l have not yet been inside the walls,
but l know l must do it.


165
00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:14.600
Stefania. We are at war.

166
00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:19.630
You are a soldier now. A soldier
must be tough or she cannot fight.


167
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.630
Oh! Hold her.
Hold her still, good, good.


168
00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.520
- Why do you bother?
- Because we want your child to survive.


169
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.630
lf you want her to live, please,
take her from me, get her out of here.


170
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.550
l'm begging you,
take her outside the wall.


171
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.520
- l'm sorry.
- It's not possible.


172
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.660
Next!

173
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.640
Please, Mama, go back to bed.

174
00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.420
l am fine. Do not worry.

175
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.550
What is it?

176
00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:08.550
Tell me.

177
00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.550
Irena?

178
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.510
Irenka, tell me what.

179
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.440
Today, l understood something.

180
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.550
Something about what?

181
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.630
l thought l was doing all l could

182
00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:44.660
but the truth is l am doing nothing.

183
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:46.460
Nothing?

184
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.460
ls it my imagination
or was there a little Jewish child


185
00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.540
sleeping in your bed last night.

186
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.540
One child is not enough!

187
00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:00.440
Oh Irena, you are so like your father.

188
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.650
Little Anna has always lived
outside the Ghetto.


189
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.540
Inside the wall there are thousands
of children who could be rescued.


190
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.440
Take them out?

191
00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.480
ls that what you're thinking?

192
00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.650
Past the Gestapo?

193
00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:25.590
German soldiers, 
Jewish police?

194
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.520
How is that possible?

195
00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:35.540
You are a social worker,

196
00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.600
a good social worker

197
00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:49.450
with the biggest heart l know but to
risk everything for something you know


198
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.610
nothing about...

199
00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.610
l remember what father used to say.

200
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:14.420
You see a man drowning,
you must try to save him,


201
00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.630
even if you can't swim.

202
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.650
For you?

203
00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.480
Two loaves, please.

204
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:34.550
- You are a Jew.
- No, l'm not.


205
00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.520
One of those filthy little
smugglers from the ghetto.


206
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:37.570
No, l'm Polish.

207
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.600
Let's see you make
the sign of the cross!


208
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:42.660
Let's go!

209
00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.440
With this red hair,
you do not think you look Jewish?


210
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.610
- And get yourself a cap.
- Yes, miss.


211
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.600
lf you want to survive outside
the Ghetto you must lie with


212
00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.460
more conviction. And learn how to
cross yourself. Like this. Now, you.


213
00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.610
Again. Quickly!

214
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.590
Very good. Get out of here.

215
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.490
Wait!

216
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:14.660
Who is it?

217
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:19.470
Hide!
They're coming here. Shh.


218
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.460
l'm afraid.

219
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.580
l want to help children
inside, the, ghetto.


220
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.510
lt is very dangerous - too dangerous.

221
00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.440
Yes, probably, but what would it take?

222
00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.660
Well, l suppose an organized network
of people you trust, enough money


223
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:55.450
for each child's room and board.

224
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:59.510
And if you agree, more Polish families
willing to hide a Jewish child.


225
00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:02.620
- l will try to find some.
- What about identity cards?


226
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:07.550
That shouldn't be hard, if l destroy
some of the parish death certificates,


227
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:09.590
issue new baptismal certificates.

228
00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:13.510
That is all the proof Germans
need for an identity card.


229
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.630
The only thing is,
how to get them out?


230
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.470
There is someone you must talk to--
a young man who smuggles


231
00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.560
potatoes from the Aryan side,
he works in Korczak's orphanage.


232
00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.550
Ask him to introduce you
to Stefan Zgrzembski.


233
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.460
- Zgrzembski?
- Yes, that's him.


234
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:38.480
Guten morgen, Father.

235
00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.470
Doctor Korczak, how many children
live inside the ghetto?


236
00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:56.520
lncluding all the ones who live in
the streets? There must be at least


237
00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.650
eighty thousand, half under
the age of ten. Be brave now.


238
00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.500
Have you ever tried to get any out?

239
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:04.520
Out to where?

240
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.570
Not so many Poles want to hide
a Jewish child.


241
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:12.480
And how many Jews would let their
children live with Gentiles?


242
00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.520
What about orphans, these ones?

243
00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.520
Even if you found a way, most of mine
could not survive outside the wall.


244
00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:22.620
- Why not?
- She only speaks Yiddish. Is that not right?


245
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:28.420
They all speak excellent Yiddish.
Polish, that's another matter.


246
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.610
And they are all beautiful

247
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.560
but most are not passable as Aryan.

248
00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:36.520
Irena?

249
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:38.600
Oh, Stefan.

250
00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.610
lt's been a long time.

251
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.500
Irena is here to see you.

252
00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.590
You attended my classes together.

253
00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.580
Yes, a long time ago.

254
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:59.610
Let me deal with these

255
00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.620
horrible little savages!

256
00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:15.610
l have found something here with
Doctor Korczak and the children.


257
00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:20.440
l am glad.
But you still smuggle potatoes.


258
00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:26.620
Irena Sendler,
always straight to the point.


259
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:30.620
Tell me how.

260
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:36.540
l know a few safe ways to get out,
the courthouse has two ways out,


261
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.610
one from the ghetto side
and one from the Aryan side.


262
00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.650
That's in the ghetto, from the Aryan
side it's by Ogrodowa street.


263
00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.610
l...
l know a man with the key.


264
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.450
- The other ways?
- l can show you.


265
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:25.650
The main sewer line goes all the way down
to the central junction under Gdanski station.


266
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.500
- And from there?
- Anywhere you want.


267
00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.600
One line goes under Okopowa Street,

268
00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.500
another under goes under Marszalkowska,

269
00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.530
third line goes under
New Town and Miodowa Street.


270
00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:58.640
The Germans keep the courts so busy
they have forgotten this entrance.


271
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:12.640
You remember our summer walks
along the Vistula River?


272
00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:14.480
Every step.

273
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.420
Shall we?

274
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:34.580
Welcome to Warsaw.

275
00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.440
Thank you, Stefan.

276
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.470
We will use this way first.

277
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.490
- Be careful.
- You know me.


278
00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:46.560
That is what l mean.
Be careful about yourself.


279
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.450
Hurry up, hurry up.

280
00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:52.560
Hello.

281
00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:57.550
You remember me?
What's your name?


282
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:04.560
The boy who sits beside
you every day.


283
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.650
ls he your brother?

284
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.530
He died.

285
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:12.660
l'm very sorry.

286
00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.440
Can you tell me where you live?

287
00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:32.540
All right.

288
00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:35.430
Come with me.

289
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.450
We have hot soup.
Just made for you.


290
00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:57.610
Are you going to get her
changed in here?


291
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.460
Yes. l think it's a good idea.

292
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.450
- Oh, you are so hungry.
- All right.


293
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:05.430
We need to do something
about her hair.


294
00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:08.580
- Can we braid it?
- Please help if you would. All right.


295
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.450
- Lets take this skirt off.
- Good girl.


296
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.610
And try a beret.

297
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.430
lt will keep you warm.

298
00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:20.600
Ah, much better. Good girl.
You look so beautiful.


299
00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.530
Ready for a little walk in the
courthouse?


300
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.480
My name is Miriam.

301
00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.650
Come along, sweetie, we must--

302
00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:55.610
Such a little trouble-maker.

303
00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:00.640
You have no idea. Come along,
sweetheart.


304
00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.430
- You want to play with this?
- Thank you.


305
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.590
- Rabbi.
- For me?


306
00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.640
Such a dashing fashion for a Rabbi.

307
00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:32.660
And for you, Miss Nijinska!

308
00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:38.580
Oh yes, l remember this book!

309
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:48.440
- Come in. Oh, yes. Come in, come in!
- Thank you Rabbi.


310
00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:51.650
So many people without shelter.

311
00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:55.570
Eva. Hannah, come here.

312
00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:57.630
Take this place.

313
00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.460
Shall we read a little bit?

314
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.440
Why do l have to be a Jew?

315
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.430
You were born into the Jewish faith.

316
00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:23.630
What if l want to be something else?

317
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.490
l don't like being
hated by everybody.


318
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:31.570
Everybody does not hate you.

319
00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:36.580
Yes they do. You know it's true.

320
00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.550
What did we ever do?

321
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:44.560
lt's not fair.

322
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.590
No, It's not.

323
00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.620
There are ways to get out of the ghetto,
ways that are still safe.


324
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:06.640
- l cannot.
- Yes, l know.


325
00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.540
But l've been thinking about Karolyna.

326
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:12.460
Karolyna?

327
00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.630
We know Polish families who
can be trusted, several priests,


328
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.620
- convents in the countryside.
- Stop, Irena!


329
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:22.420
Let me ask you one thing,
tell me from your heart.


330
00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.420
How is it possible
for a mother to give up a child? How?


331
00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:31.630
Now l must ask you something -
a terrible thing.


332
00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.540
No, no don't, please...

333
00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:38.580
lf it happened that the rumors are true

334
00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:43.490
and if for Karolyna you had to
choose between life and death...


335
00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:48.620
- Please, l cannot face it, l cannot.
- You can, Eva - and you must.


336
00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.570
Irenka. Do you know what this
author says about life?


337
00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.500
- Mama, please, l have to go.
- Please.


338
00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:18.420
Take one moment to breathe.
Please.


339
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:25.610
What this writer says is in order
to have a happy life,


340
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.660
you must exercise your own free will.

341
00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:30.640
Interesting. Bye-bye.

342
00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:35.430
Which is why l would never tell you
not to do something or suggest


343
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:39.510
to you that l might possibly be worried.
l would never do such a thing.


344
00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:41.430
No matter what happens.

345
00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:44.440
Thank you, Mama.

346
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:48.560
Thank you.

347
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.530
- What has happened?
- All the Social Service programs


348
00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:09.530
- have been suspended.
- Who has access?


349
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:13.570
From now on only nurses, doctors,
workers in the Health Department.


350
00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.600
Today l was told l am officially
responsible for any further spread


351
00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:30.610
of Typhus.

352
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:33.630
You know
it is impossible, what do they--


353
00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.620
Of course it's impossible.
That's their point.


354
00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:42.470
lf l cannot help myself,
how can l help you?


355
00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.600
l will need Health Department
work passes, four - no, no


356
00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:48.620
maybe five nurse's uniforms.

357
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:50.540
lt that all?

358
00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.620
Perhaps a larger vehicle.

359
00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.490
We will seek orphans and homeless
in the market area and specific families


360
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:04.500
we already know are willing
to let us place their children...


361
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:08.660
One of Doctor Majkowski's drivers
has volunteered, Piotr Lipinski.


362
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:10.450
Miss Irena.

363
00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.470
- Hello.
- Hello.


364
00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.430
Thank you, Piotr.
You understand the risk?


365
00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:18.540
Only small problems,
but l am not too worried.


366
00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:20.620
We will take my disinfectant truck.

367
00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:30.560
- l beg you, keep them together.
- l'm sorry, it's not possible.


368
00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:34.540
Sister Jolanta, please understand
whatever happens they will always


369
00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:36.440
have each other.

370
00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.650
One slip, one word in Yiddish.
They could give each other away.


371
00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:44.480
How will l ever find them?
How will they find each other.


372
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:48.540
The important thing is to survive.

373
00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.430
Take her. Please go!

374
00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.540
Tell me, what do you want
to be when you grow up?


375
00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:27.610
A priest.

376
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:31.570
Yes, very good, that's perfect!

377
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:34.450
You can do it.

378
00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:59.600
Papers? Vehicle check.

379
00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.580
What do you have in the truck?

380
00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:20.540
- We have a problem. Vehicle check.
- All right. Let's go for a walk.


381
00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:39.490
Our Father who art in Heaven,

382
00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:42.570
Hallowed be thy name...

383
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:45.530
Thy kingdom come.

384
00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:50.540
Thy will be done on earth,
as it is in Heaven.


385
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:56.540
Give us this day our daily bread.

386
00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:02.470
And forgive us our trespasses,

387
00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:06.480
as we forgive those who

388
00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:09.490
trespass against us...

389
00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:16.620
Children!

390
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:23.430
Let's show Miss Irena
how we know our bedtime prayers.


391
00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:27.630
Now l lay me down to sleep,

392
00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:32.470
l pray the Lord my soul to keep;

393
00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:36.560
And if l die before l wake,

394
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:40.600
l pray the Lord my soul to take.

395
00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:47.650
First month. Room and board.

396
00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.440
ls there anything else l should know?

397
00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.440
She had a brother.

398
00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:23.570
- This is Adam.
- Hello, Adam!


399
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:27.450
- Does he speak Polish?
- Perfectly.


400
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.630
Irena.

401
00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:15.630
Jacob!

402
00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:20.610
l'm sorry,
l didn't mean to frighten you.


403
00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:22.600
ls Eva all right, Karolyna?

404
00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.560
Yes, everything's the same.

405
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:28.420
Eva has met with community leaders.
They want to speak about


406
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:30.520
- hiding their children.
- Of course.


407
00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:33.630
You had a good instinct,

408
00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.500
to rescue Karolyna,

409
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:40.640
it's risky but there is no other way.

410
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.560
And what if my wife and l do
not survive the war.


411
00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.480
Who will claim our son?

412
00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:50.620
l keep a record of every child.

413
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:53.550
And if this record or you are destroyed?

414
00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.420
What guarantee can you give
our children will survive?


415
00:42:56.470 --> 00:43:00.540
l can't guarantee anything,
not even escape from the Ghetto.


416
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:05.430
Babies pass easily but if they
can speak, they must speak Polish,


417
00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.580
know Catholic hymns and prayers.

418
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:09.650
My children only speak Yiddish.

419
00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.540
l understand this is very difficult.

420
00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.630
They will need to memorize
their new Christian names,


421
00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.630
their new home address,
the entire history of their new family,


422
00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.660
harmless gossip about
their neighbors - all of it.


423
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:26.540
What you are saying is we must
teach our children to lie.


424
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:28.660
To survive, yes.

425
00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:33.550
- What about conversion?
- l make it clear l do not wish this.


426
00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.580
You may not wish it, but on young,
impressionable minds,


427
00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:42.440
time and education will surely
dim any memories of their past.


428
00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:45.490
ln this case, he will grow up
a good Christian.


429
00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:51.630
For mothers and fathers, to give away
a child is an unthinkable act.


430
00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:54.580
This is the truth.

431
00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:00.480
The other truth is Hitler calls Jews
a cancer on the nation and speaks


432
00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:04.420
openly about the annihilation of every
Jew on the continent.


433
00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:08.580
Outside these walls there are
Poles prepared to risk their lives


434
00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.540
to save your children.

435
00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:17.490
We Jews - We Jews have survived
in the hardest times.


436
00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:20.560
And now we are faced with
another extinction.


437
00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:25.430
Perhaps this time we can only
be saved by a new generation of Jews.


438
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:31.530
How wise are we to take away
the birthright of this new generation?


439
00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:37.610
l recommend we
consider this proposal.


440
00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:39.570
Thank you.

441
00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:47.490
l am not in favor of sending our
children into such a dubious world.


442
00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:53.530
Now America is in the war. This news
favors our liberation and for this,


443
00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:55.650
we should wait.

444
00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:03.550
Our dear friend has presented us
with the difficult truths of our time.


445
00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:09.530
We should thank
her for her courage to speak.


446
00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:45.650
Quickly.

447
00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:57.430
Jasio go back,
there's another bag!


448
00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:59.530
- No! l will not.
- Go get it!


449
00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:07.430
Let me go!!!

450
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:10.640
No, No!!!

451
00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:29.530
Sister Jolanta. Walk with me.
Please, please.


452
00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:34.420
My name is Michal Laski,
l know who you are and what you do.


453
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.510
The man you saw just now.
He is Untersturmfuhrer Karl Brandt.


454
00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:40.580
He is in charge of Jewish Resettlement.
We are told in a few months they will


455
00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.510
begin to send everyone in the
ghetto to work camps in the East.


456
00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:47.550
- Why do you tell me this?
- l have a son - Jasio, 10 years old. His...


457
00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:54.560
His mother died last year.
He has no one.


458
00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:56.620
- He has you.
- He lives with smugglers,


459
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:59.550
goes under the wall at night,
risks his life every day.


460
00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:01.650
l want to get him out before
he's caught and shot.


461
00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:04.460
lf from time to time l help you,
will you help me?


462
00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:06.620
Mr. Laski, l will help your son
without conditions.


463
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:10.520
lf from time to time you help me,
you would be helping many children,


464
00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:13.570
- including your son.
- There's a passage through a brick wall


465
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:16.580
on Twarda Street. On the other side
in the abandoned house.


466
00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.470
Does your Jasio have red hair like you?

467
00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:22.420
Yes but thanks to God
he now wears a cap.


468
00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:33.570
You know about this new German unit
now in charge of the Ghetto.


469
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:36.440
Yes, for work camp resettlement.

470
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.430
Stefan, do not be like this.

471
00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:44.620
You know how many thousands of Jews
have disappeared from the Lodz Ghetto.


472
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:49.570
Vanished. And to where?
Some place they call Resettlement.


473
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:52.560
Doctor Korczak told me to prepare
for the worst.


474
00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:55.610
lf there is no other way,
that is what l must do.


475
00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:03.590
Where is everyone?
What has happened?


476
00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:07.510
Books, bank accounts, invoices,
reciepts they've taken over all of it.


477
00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:08.500
Who?

478
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.630
Guten tag.

479
00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:21.650
Amen.

480
00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:47.490
Karolyna, can you tell us why this night
is different from all other nights?


481
00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:24.640
Sweetheart?

482
00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:29.630
l know why tonight is different.

483
00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:34.640
Tonight is different because once
we were slaves and now we are free!


484
00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:54.460
Jacob!

485
00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:56.500
Papa!

486
00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.620
l am not here for Sedar.

487
00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.480
l have some news you must hear.

488
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:06.560
Eva.

489
00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:13.450
The underground received information
verified by Polish train machinists,


490
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:16.580
some lucky Jews who escaped,
even from a few good Germans.


491
00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.450
They all say camps are being built.

492
00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:23.550
Concentration camps, work camps.
Auschwitz is like this, we know.


493
00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:27.450
You remember the thousands of Jews
who were deported from Lodz,


494
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:28.660
the ones who disappeared.

495
00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:34.430
Last week 300 train cars of clothing
returned for sorting.


496
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.510
What else, Jacob?

497
00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:44.610
We hear rumors they are building
another camp. Treblinka.


498
00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:49.420
Only 90 kilometers from Warsaw where
there are fake station platforms,


499
00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:50.650
underground bunkers.

500
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:55.580
One thing they have not
constructed - barracks.


501
00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:02.570
No barracks, l do not understand.
Why no barracks?


502
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:05.480
Mama, they do not...

503
00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:09.620
ln such a camp,
the only purpose is death.


504
00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:18.590
We need to find a way
to get you out of the Ghetto.


505
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:24.430
Get out, you say! Get out how?
Get out to where?


506
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:27.480
Papa,

507
00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.640
Irena has made
an offer for Karolyna.


508
00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:35.600
There is a convent in the countryside.

509
00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:41.550
This is not possible.
She will be converted! Never!


510
00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.440
Chaim!

511
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:48.630
These many months
l have said nothing.


512
00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:52.570
Now l will give my opinion.

513
00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:59.420
Our dearest Irena has risked
her life for us many times.


514
00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:02.650
Now, she has made an offer for
Karolyna we must accept.


515
00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:06.550
- l believe a convent is best.
- No, it must not be done.


516
00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:08.530
Chaim Rozenfeld!

517
00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:14.600
You have loved me since l was a little
girl in pigtails and after these


518
00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:17.510
many years you know very well

519
00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:21.490
an opinion from me
is not a suggestion.


520
00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:44.500
Next time,
when you come she will be prepared.


521
00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:48.520
Irena, the Underground knows
what you're doing.


522
00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:49.630
They want to help.

523
00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:53.450
There's a man you should speak to,
goes by the name Trojan.


524
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:55.450
24 Zurawia Street.

525
00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:57.530
Zurawia, 24.

526
00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:03.550
For Karolyna, l promise,
l will do everything...


527
00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:06.480
We know that, Irena. We know.

528
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:21.440
l'm Trojan.

529
00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:23.440
- And l'm Victor.
- Who do you represent?


530
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:25.440
- Konrad Zegota.
- Why me? What do you know?


531
00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.500
You created an efficient network,
saved many children.


532
00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.620
So far no one has been betrayed
or exposed.


533
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:32.430
We, with the Underground,
have a good deal of money,


534
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:34.530
and contacts.
It could be a good arrangement.


535
00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:38.600
- This money, where does it come from?
- Polish government in exile in London.


536
00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:42.420
- To help Jews?
- Zegota exists only for that.


537
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.540
- Who is Konrad Zegota?
- He does not exist.


538
00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:47.610
Which makes him hard to find,
especially for Germans


539
00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:49.570
who will never stop looking.

540
00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:52.640
What is your proposal?

541
00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:57.470
We will help you
rescue children. If you agree.


542
00:55:01.650 --> 00:55:03.450
l agree.

543
00:55:04.610 --> 00:55:08.450
We'll give you money,
Aryan papers, work records.


544
00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:12.420
You'll get them while picking up
the linen from the laundry at Bracka street,


545
00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:14.450
near the Three Crosses Square.

546
00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:16.650
This will be our contact point.

547
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:39.630
- Looks like we're back in business.
- Let me count.


548
00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:42.540
Look. Identification cards.

549
00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:47.530
Very good work. 
These will do.

550
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:04.420
- What's going on?
- They're deporting adults and children.


551
00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:05.560
- Orphanages?
- Yes.


552
00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:05.630
Stefan.

553
00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:53.550
Stefan.

554
00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:56.620
You must get out.
Do it, for me, for the children.


555
00:57:57.570 --> 00:58:00.520
You must see and remember
and tell the world.


556
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:03.430
- No.
- Go. Go on. Quickly.


557
00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:05.430
Now.
Go, go, quickly!


558
00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:06.640
You know how to do it.

559
00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:12.580
May God walk with you. Go! Go!

560
00:58:55.590 --> 00:58:57.530
Thanks be to God!

561
00:58:57.590 --> 00:58:59.510
They took all the children.

562
00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:04.600
l saw them, l couldn't
do anything about it.


563
00:59:05.610 --> 00:59:07.490
l've heard this news.

564
00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.530
Who told you?

565
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:12.520
Your friend.

566
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:44.560
Let's go son, don't be afraid
l'll hide you to keep you warm.


567
00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:46.460
Are you ok?

568
01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:32.460
- There is a chance today.
- Please, one more day, just one.


569
01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.500
Now it is possible,
tomorrow is uncertain.


570
01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:41.530
We can't do it now.
Please, one more day, just one.


571
01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:46.440
Now it's possible.
Tomorrow is uncertain.


572
01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:49.470
Tomorrow he will be ready,

573
01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:50.600
l promise.

574
01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:05.620
You mustn't lock the door.

575
01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:10.470
Jews who refuse to leave
the building will be executed.


576
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.650
Run downstairs, run.

577
01:01:59.430 --> 01:02:01.510
No more courthouse entrance.

578
01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.530
A big problem.

579
01:02:29.570 --> 01:02:32.480
Oh, stop fiddling,
You're making me nervous.


580
01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:34.580
You need to get more rest.

581
01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:38.500
For Heaven's sake,
if l'd had a stroke, l'd be dead.


582
01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:42.440
l'm telling you, l got up too fast,
l fainted. That's all.


583
01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.600
You are in bad condition,
l'm not joking.


584
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:51.430
You are a very brave young woman.

585
01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.510
Stefan?

586
01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:07.430
There's room for two.

587
01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:08.560
What are you doing?

588
01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:11.650
A little carpentry.

589
01:03:19.610 --> 01:03:20.660
What do you think?

590
01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:25.610
l feel a little bit confined.
l think l need to get out.


591
01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:29.610
lt's, it's not opening.
It's stuck.


592
01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:32.460
lt, it, hmm...

593
01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.420
Can you please try? Please.

594
01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.480
- It's stuck from the outside.
- No. Please, open it. Please.


595
01:03:51.490 --> 01:03:55.470
OK. All right, l need to,
we need to get out of here.


596
01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:57.570
We must call your mother.

597
01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.570
Mama?

598
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.610
Irenka?

599
01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:20.560
Jasio?

600
01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:50.440
Jasio?

601
01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.510
Do you remember?

602
01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:05.530
l can't leave them. l will not.

603
01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:09.470
You, you have done a good thing,
Jasio, a very important thing


604
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:12.560
and it may be hard to
understand but the future will


605
01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:15.450
need your compassion
even more than now.


606
01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:18.440
Which is why
tomorrow you must save yourself.


607
01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:21.540
You know the coal room?
Where the Rabbis study?


608
01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.590
Two o'clock tomorrow my friend
will meet you there.


609
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:29.590
She wears bright red lipstick.

610
01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:33.610
Be strong, say your good byes.

611
01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.420
l will never see you again.

612
01:05:57.470 --> 01:06:00.560
l will never see any of you again,
any of you.


613
01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:02.580
Yes, you will, l promise.

614
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:08.440
No, you can't promise.
Nobody can promise anything any more!


615
01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:12.600
Darling. Darling, darling,

616
01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:16.580
l love you with all my heart.

617
01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:21.470
My love for you is so big and
strong it will never go away.


618
01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.650
lt will always be with you.

619
01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:29.570
Whenever you think of me, l will
be there, right over your shoulder.


620
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:31.550
Forever and ever.

621
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:49.590
- Your name?
- Aniela Procowna.


622
01:06:49.650 --> 01:06:51.650
- And where are you from?
- Krakow, Poland.


623
01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:54.520
But when l grow up l want
to live in Bavaria.


624
01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:56.560
My uncle says Germany
is much more beautiful...


625
01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:58.540
- Your name?
- Aniela Procowna.


626
01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.520
- And where are you from?
- Krakow, Poland.


627
01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:04.420
But when l grow up l want
to live in Bavaria. My uncle...


628
01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:35.530
Quick, quick in!

629
01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:48.620
Out, out. Get out of here.
Out, get out! Out. Out!


630
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:58.520
l will not!

631
01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:00.580
Jasio?

632
01:08:17.530 --> 01:08:18.580
Mr. Laski!

633
01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:22.420
Out, out!

634
01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:25.640
You - come with me!

635
01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:28.660
And you, come! Move.

636
01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:37.510
Get away from here - but slowly.

637
01:08:37.570 --> 01:08:39.640
- l saw Jasio. He will get out.
- Thank you.


638
01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:43.470
Maria.

639
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:48.520
Jasio?

640
01:08:55.570 --> 01:08:56.520
l know.

641
01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.600
Come. Come.

642
01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:11.550
Jasio!

643
01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:13.620
Jasio!

644
01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:15.510
Jasio!

645
01:09:15.570 --> 01:09:16.610
Jasio! No!

646
01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.420
Let me through.

647
01:09:21.530 --> 01:09:22.580
Jasio!

648
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:24.640
Jasio!

649
01:09:25.530 --> 01:09:26.500
Jasio!

650
01:09:28.450 --> 01:09:29.510
Papa, papa.

651
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:32.580
- l tried to get out but they--
- It's all right, it's all right.


652
01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.470
All that matters is that
we are together.


653
01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:39.630
Hold onto to me so
we don't get separated.


654
01:09:41.490 --> 01:09:42.600
Faster, faster.

655
01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.610
Hold on to me, hold on to me.
-Simon!


656
01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:08.630
There has been a mistake!
No! He's my son!


657
01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:11.440
My family is protected!

658
01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:12.540
All Jews inside!

659
01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.440
My family is protected!

660
01:10:15.490 --> 01:10:16.600
Everyone inside!

661
01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:19.620
Papa!

662
01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:21.510
Jasio!

663
01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:48.520
Papa! Papa!

664
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:10.580
Jasio, l understand now why you
lived in the street.


665
01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:14.440
lt was God's way to make you strong
so you can survive.


666
01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:16.440
Here, give him my sweater.

667
01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:26.640
l cannot do it. l'm afraid, Papa.
Please, l can't.


668
01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:30.610
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
- No. l can't. Please. l'm afraid.


669
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:37.530
Jasio, listen to me.

670
01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:40.600
Land on your elbows,
keep your head down.


671
01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:43.590
- Come with me.
- Keep your head down and stay


672
01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:46.480
still until you see the train is gone.

673
01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:47.550
l love you, Papa.

674
01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:50.630
Then you must run as fast
as you can into the trees.


675
01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:54.440
l love you, Papa. Please! Come with me.
l don't want to please!


676
01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:57.590
Shh. Shh! Be quiet! 
You must be brave.

677
01:12:59.530 --> 01:13:03.490
l can't! Papa! l can't.
Please come with me. Please.


678
01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:04.580
One.

679
01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:06.620
- No! Please!
- One, two.


680
01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:07.640
Papa!

681
01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:09.530
Three!

682
01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:13.490
... my God.

683
01:14:28.650 --> 01:14:30.580
Look at that.

684
01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:33.620
Thank you.

685
01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:35.570
My darling.

686
01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:03.510
Children! Children, shh.

687
01:15:03.570 --> 01:15:06.540
Children, this is Anielka.
She will be joining us.


688
01:15:15.650 --> 01:15:18.540
Please don't leave me, please.

689
01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:26.630
This war will end and you will survive
to be a mother and tell your story.


690
01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:30.580
And one day, if
we are both very clever,

691
01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:35.640
l will find you.
l promise.


692
01:15:37.530 --> 01:15:40.430
Now there is something you
must promise me.


693
01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.640
You must promise that
you will always remember that


694
01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:47.620
you are the famous Miss Nijinska,

695
01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.500
Prima ballerina.

696
01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:55.530
l love you.

697
01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:00.520
Me too.

698
01:16:08.650 --> 01:16:09.660
Go on, now.

699
01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:49.490
Shouldn't you have taught
me this as a child?


700
01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:52.560
- Over and under.
- It's beautiful.


701
01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:56.630
- You are so mean.
- It is a mess do it again.


702
01:16:57.450 --> 01:16:59.630
- He's telling the truth.
- It's hideous.


703
01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:02.460
This is never going to be...

704
01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:05.570
l give up.

705
01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:11.610
Gestapo.

706
01:17:19.450 --> 01:17:20.480
l will do it.

707
01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:36.540
Irena Sendler?

708
01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:37.590
l am.

709
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:51.550
- Look in the bathroom and kitchen.

710
01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:07.510
Do you have Jews here?

711
01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:10.540
Of course not.
It's against the law.


712
01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.480
We'll find out.

713
01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.440
You will come with us.

714
01:18:35.650 --> 01:18:37.550
Let me get a few things.

715
01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:39.570
There's no need.

716
01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:44.530
Irena Sendler, good afternoon.

717
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:49.440
l work for
Department of Social Services.


718
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:50.580
l know. l know.

719
01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:08.560
Your father was a doctor,
worked with Jews.


720
01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:13.530
- He worked with anyone who was sick.
- Yes. Until the Jews gave him Typhus.


721
01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:35.440
Who is Konrad Zegota?

722
01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.590
Who?

723
01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:54.620
Who is Konrad Zegota?

724
01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:56.500
l don't know.

725
01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:00.480
Who is Konrad Zegota?

726
01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:03.490
l don't know.

727
01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:08.540
You have been denounced
by many people.


728
01:21:09.630 --> 01:21:12.600
For example,
the little shop where you pick up


729
01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:16.480
your laundry on Bracka Street near
Three Crosses Square.


730
01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:19.430
We know you are not so involved
with these criminals.


731
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:22.580
And if you tell us where to find
this man you will not be executed.


732
01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:13.630
Sendler, out!

733
01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:16.440
What does it mean?

734
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:11.470
Sendler. Dentist.

735
01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.640
ZEGOTA WILL HELP.
You're wasting your time and mine.


736
01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:31.550
l'm ordered to place a dressing,
l place a dressing.


737
01:23:31.610 --> 01:23:34.500
For what? She will be
dead in the morning.


738
01:23:34.630 --> 01:23:36.660
l do what l'm told, that's all.

739
01:24:23.530 --> 01:24:24.580
Stefania?

740
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:26.600
You're alive!

741
01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:31.620
l swear, l told them nothing.
l was quiet as a mouse.


742
01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:35.510
- You know l would never betray you.
- As a good soldier.


743
01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:38.420
- Yes.
- A good soldier.


744
01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.520
You have done very well.

745
01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:46.610
Everyone out! Out!

746
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:02.560
Not you!

747
01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:04.560
No! No, wait. Wait!

748
01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:18.600
Aim!

749
01:25:19.630 --> 01:25:20.600
Fire!

750
01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:25.530
Get away from here! Go! Go!

751
01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:28.600
Go!

752
01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:32.460
But, l, l don't have
my identification card!


753
01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:36.420
Stupid woman! You are dead! With them.
Go! Run away! Get out!


754
01:25:57.660 --> 01:25:59.470
Irena!

755
01:26:05.650 --> 01:26:06.630
Viktor.

756
01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:14.500
They'll find out.
And they'll look for you.


757
01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:17.420
l'll be safe.

758
01:26:17.530 --> 01:26:21.440
Your mother is right,
your feet need a specialist.


759
01:26:21.490 --> 01:26:24.520
l know it's hard but please
try not to walk too much.


760
01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.570
Promise me...

761
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:45.590
you won't come to my funeral.

762
01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:51.590
- Mama, don't say such things.
- Promise me.


763
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:58.580
Irenka.

764
01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.620
Can l tell you something.

765
01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:09.610
l'm...

766
01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:11.450
proud...

767
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:12.540
of you.

768
01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:13.590
Very proud

769
01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:18.560
So many l could not save.

770
01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:23.510
You've done a good and decent thing.

771
01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:27.490
ln this world that's not so bad.

772
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:30.500
lt's time.

773
01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.560
We must be in the mountains
before dark.


774
01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:43.630
Mama.

775
01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:48.440
Don't worry,

776
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:50.500
l'll be fine.

777
01:27:57.450 --> 01:27:58.480
Go.

778
01:28:23.630 --> 01:28:24.640
Wait, Irena.

779
01:28:25.610 --> 01:28:26.540
Trojan.

780
01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:28.600
Thank you so much for all
you've done.


781
01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:30.580
No. Thank you.

782
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:35.490
There's something
Konrad Zegota must have.


783
01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:40.620
They're all here.

784
01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.610
Every child.

785
01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.540
Where we hid them.

786
01:28:47.490 --> 01:28:48.600
When all this is over,

787
01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:52.580
they must be returned
to whatever remains of their families.


788
01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:54.540
l will do it. l promise.

789
01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:55.650
Thank you.

790
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:17.630
From now on you are Klara Dabrowska.

791
01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:33.450
Once upon a time,
there was a little girl


792
01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:39.450
l am so fond of stories
that begin that way.


793
01:29:53.450 --> 01:29:55.570
l have kielbasa, bread...

794
01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:58.560
- You like?
- Yes, l do.


795
01:29:58.620 --> 01:29:59.590
Good!

796
01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:05.450
- First, you must come meet my pigs.
- Really Piotr, that's not necessary.


797
01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:12.580
One thing l can say about town folk,
they make terrible farmers.


798
01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:14.480
Please, let me down.

799
01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:33.570
Oh, thank God.

800
01:30:41.490 --> 01:30:43.630
- Are you all right?
- Now, yes


801
01:30:59.430 --> 01:31:00.640
We must fight for what is good.

802
01:31:01.530 --> 01:31:03.570
Good must prevail.

803
01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:07.470
lt must prevail and l believe in this.

804
01:31:07.530 --> 01:31:09.570
As long as l'm alive...

805
01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:11.610
as long as l have strength...

806
01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:14.620
l will say good is best.

807
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:16.560
Love,

808
01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:18.460
tolerance

809
01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:20.580
and humility

810
01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:23.550
- -that's it.
