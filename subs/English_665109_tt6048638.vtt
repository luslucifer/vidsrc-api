try that radio thing


495
00:33:32.619 --> 00:33:33.517
that I showed you.

496
00:33:33.551 --> 00:33:34.690
I've tried it already.

497
00:33:34.725 --> 00:33:37.314
He simply corrects it
and carries on.


498
00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:38.142
You already?

499
00:33:39.419 --> 00:33:41.766
That's a power move,
not an opener.


500
00:33:41.801 --> 00:33:44.044
Have you forgotten how
to structure a haunting?


501
00:33:44.079 --> 00:33:45.839
I have not forgotten.

502
00:33:45.874 --> 00:33:47.531
Perhaps you're just tired.

503
00:33:47.565 --> 00:33:50.050
I mean, you have been in
that house for a long time.


504
00:33:50.085 --> 00:33:51.397
It is my house.

505
00:33:51.431 --> 00:33:53.502
Well yes, because
we gave it to you.


506
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.885
It did not call for me?

507
00:34:00.337 --> 00:34:03.063
Well, it didn't
not call for you.


508
00:34:03.098 --> 00:34:06.377
It had been empty for a long
time, but none of this matters.


509
00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:09.656
[sighs]

510
00:34:09.691 --> 00:34:13.350
The house is your house,
and what you've done with it,


511
00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:15.524
no one else could
have done with it.


512
00:34:15.559 --> 00:34:17.043
Your success rate
is beyond reproach.


513
00:34:17.077 --> 00:34:18.596
I mean, you're on the wall.

514
00:34:19.701 --> 00:34:22.393
I'm on the wall?

515
00:34:22.428 --> 00:34:25.051
You really haven't been in
the office much, have you?


516
00:34:25.085 --> 00:34:26.535
The Legacy Wall.

517
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:27.743
It's a good thing.

518
00:34:29.745 --> 00:34:31.126
But of course
we still have the problem


519
00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.956
of this current case.

520
00:34:33.991 --> 00:34:36.096
Perhaps we can bring
someone in to help you.


521
00:34:36.131 --> 00:34:37.477
What? No thank you.

522
00:34:37.512 --> 00:34:39.341
Oh, no. Hear me out.

523
00:34:39.376 --> 00:34:40.342
We have a new agent.

524
00:34:40.377 --> 00:34:41.654
She's a young woman named Rosie

525
00:34:41.688 --> 00:34:43.932
and she has had
tremendous success


526
00:34:43.966 --> 00:34:46.348
with some of our most
troublesome cases.


527
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.386
She kind of reminds me
a little of you


528
00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.663
when you first came to us.

529
00:34:50.697 --> 00:34:52.837
She could learn
so much from you,


530
00:34:52.872 --> 00:34:55.806
and I bet you could learn
a thing or two from her.


531
00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.359
I shall return to my house now.

532
00:34:57.394 --> 00:34:58.084
Thank you.

533
00:34:58.118 --> 00:34:59.775
[Ms. Henry] All right.

534
00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:01.743
I'll give Rosie a call and see
if we can get her right over.


535
00:35:01.777 --> 00:35:03.952
Oh, and don't forget
about your time card.


536
00:35:07.473 --> 00:35:08.819
[Neal] Hey Jack.
Finished already?


537
00:35:08.853 --> 00:35:10.027
Um, no.

538
00:35:11.925 --> 00:35:12.892
[Neal] Oh, okay.

539
00:35:14.411 --> 00:35:16.067
Um, what's up?

540
00:35:16.102 --> 00:35:21.141
Uh, have you ever seen
anything that you can't explain?


541
00:35:21.176 --> 00:35:24.041
[Neal] I have two
infant sons, Jack.


542
00:35:24.075 --> 00:35:27.113
I see shit I can't explain
all the time.


543
00:35:27.147 --> 00:35:30.841
I think I know why people
keep leaving your house.


544
00:35:30.875 --> 00:35:32.532
[Neal] Oh yeah? Why is that?

545
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.432
It's haunted.

546
00:35:37.226 --> 00:35:39.125
[Neal sighs]

547
00:35:39.159 --> 00:35:40.851
[Neal] I don't have
time for this, Jack.


548
00:35:40.885 --> 00:35:42.508
No, I'm serious.
There's a ghost here.


549
00:35:42.542 --> 00:35:45.511
It's a lady ghost.
Fine, there's a ghost.


550
00:35:45.545 --> 00:35:47.616
Do your job and get rid of it.

551
00:35:47.651 --> 00:35:50.067
Is, is that my job?

552
00:35:50.101 --> 00:35:54.899
[Neal] If you're calling me
about it, yes, it is your job.


553
00:35:56.936 --> 00:35:57.833
I gotta say,
you're really taking


554
00:35:57.868 --> 00:35:59.490
this ghost thing in stride.

555
00:36:00.249 --> 00:36:01.561
[Neal] Well, yeah.

556
00:36:02.769 --> 00:36:05.841
I don't believe you,
but I'm too tired


557
00:36:05.876 --> 00:36:08.016
to try to figure out what
you're not telling me,


558
00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:11.468
so sure, there's a ghost.

559
00:36:11.502 --> 00:36:12.434
Fix it.

560
00:36:15.679 --> 00:36:17.232
[tense music]

561
00:36:17.266 --> 00:36:18.682
So you're a ghost?

562
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:22.582
Can you not talk?

563
00:36:23.583 --> 00:36:25.205
You made that noise earlier.

564
00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.621
Is that all you can do?

565
00:36:28.692 --> 00:36:29.865
Nothing? All right.

566
00:36:34.629 --> 00:36:37.148
[Jack hums, sings to himself]

567
00:36:37.183 --> 00:36:39.703
'Cause ghost don't wash
dishes 'cause they're dead.


568
00:36:39.737 --> 00:36:41.912
[humming]

569
00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:46.848
I am not a ghost.

570
00:36:46.882 --> 00:36:48.643
Okay. What do you call yourself?

571
00:36:48.677 --> 00:36:50.576
They call us spectral agents.

572
00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:52.509
[chuckles] Yeah no,
no one calls you that.


573
00:36:52.543 --> 00:36:53.613
You're a ghost.

574
00:36:53.648 --> 00:36:55.857
Spectral agents.

575
00:36:55.891 --> 00:36:57.237
Why are you not afraid?

576
00:36:57.272 --> 00:36:59.032
Because you're not real.

577
00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.759
I am real.

578
00:37:01.794 --> 00:37:03.036
Agree to disagree.

579
00:37:03.071 --> 00:37:05.211
[humming]

580
00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:09.042
What are you doing?

581
00:37:09.077 --> 00:37:11.182
I don't know!

582
00:37:11.217 --> 00:37:12.908
I'm cleaning up
the other people's shit


583
00:37:12.943 --> 00:37:15.911
so that other people can move
in their shit into this house.


584
00:37:17.016 --> 00:37:19.018
You are the one
who brings the people.


585
00:37:19.052 --> 00:37:22.124
No, I make the places
ready for them.


586
00:37:22.159 --> 00:37:23.781
We are enemies.

587
00:37:23.816 --> 00:37:24.610
What? No.

588
00:37:24.644 --> 00:37:25.749
What? That's silly.

589
00:37:25.783 --> 00:37:27.820
You make it so the people come.

590
00:37:27.854 --> 00:37:29.615
I am the one
who sends them away.


591
00:37:29.649 --> 00:37:32.894
This puts us at cross
purposes, thus, we are enemies.


592
00:37:32.928 --> 00:37:34.102
Okay, I see your reasoning,

593
00:37:34.136 --> 00:37:35.931
but I'm not enemies
with a ghost.


594
00:37:35.966 --> 00:37:38.934
Spectral agent.

595
00:37:38.969 --> 00:37:43.732
[soft, ponderous
yet plucky music]


596
00:37:48.323 --> 00:37:49.289
Yeah, you're a ghost.

597
00:37:49.324 --> 00:37:50.843
I am talking to a real ghost.

598
00:37:50.877 --> 00:37:51.878
You're here.

599
00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.193
Baaoh, this is weird.

600
00:37:58.713 --> 00:37:59.645
[Jack Shudders]

601
00:37:59.679 --> 00:38:00.611
Okay.

602
00:38:01.957 --> 00:38:02.993
Okay.

603
00:38:04.028 --> 00:38:04.926
Okay.

604
00:38:08.239 --> 00:38:10.310
Well, so if you're here,
I have a lot of questions.


605
00:38:10.345 --> 00:38:12.105
How does one become a ghost?

606
00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:13.210
Did you die young?

607
00:38:13.244 --> 00:38:14.798
Can you walk through walls?

608
00:38:14.832 --> 00:38:18.008
Will it feel like a breath
of fresh air if I touch you?


609
00:38:18.042 --> 00:38:21.598
So, what all ghost powers
do you have?


610
00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:23.876
So does this mean
there is a God?


611
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:24.946
[grunts]

612
00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.706
Does it hurt to be a ghost?

613
00:38:26.741 --> 00:38:29.226
Do ghosts even feel anything?

614
00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.228
Does it actually bother you guys

615
00:38:31.262 --> 00:38:33.644
when we speak ill of the dead?

616
00:38:33.679 --> 00:38:35.853
Or are you paying attention
to us all?


617
00:38:35.888 --> 00:38:39.063
You have better things
going on in..heaven?


618
00:38:40.202 --> 00:38:41.652
Hell?

619
00:38:42.342 --> 00:38:43.343
None?

620
00:38:43.378 --> 00:38:44.275
Hm.

621
00:38:47.209 --> 00:38:48.901
Or is God a lady?

622
00:38:48.935 --> 00:38:51.041
I don't know. This is a lot.

623
00:38:51.075 --> 00:38:52.214
You talk now.

624
00:38:54.251 --> 00:38:55.908
[Muriel] I did not die here.

625
00:38:57.357 --> 00:38:59.256
Oh, okay. Yeah,
we can start there.


626
00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:00.568
Where did you die?

627
00:39:01.879 --> 00:39:03.156
Far from here.

628
00:39:04.192 --> 00:39:05.883
Okay. Sure.

629
00:39:05.918 --> 00:39:07.022
How did you die?

630
00:39:07.057 --> 00:39:09.369
I do not like remembering that.

631
00:39:09.404 --> 00:39:10.923
That makes sense.

632
00:39:10.957 --> 00:39:12.752
So how did you get here?

633
00:39:12.787 --> 00:39:14.305
I no longer remember.

634
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:17.688
You don't like talking
very much, do you?


635
00:39:17.723 --> 00:39:18.655
I...

636
00:39:19.725 --> 00:39:21.381
Don't know.

637
00:39:21.416 --> 00:39:26.041
I have not spoken to someone
at length in a very long time.


638
00:39:26.076 --> 00:39:27.422
Oh.

639
00:39:27.456 --> 00:39:28.388
Oh, I didn't realize.

640
00:39:28.423 --> 00:39:30.011
No, I just didn't realize.

641
00:39:31.426 --> 00:39:35.395
Wait, not to get off of
you, but just real quick,


642
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:36.845
what about the God thing?

643
00:39:38.191 --> 00:39:39.641
I don't know.

644
00:39:39.676 --> 00:39:42.161
If there is one, I have
not met Him or Her.


645
00:39:42.195 --> 00:39:44.404
Okay, just curious.

646
00:39:44.439 --> 00:39:46.303
You want to sit down?
You want a beer?


647
00:39:46.337 --> 00:39:47.787
Can ghosts have beer?

648
00:39:47.822 --> 00:39:49.099
No, I cannot drink.

649
00:39:49.133 --> 00:39:50.031
Woof.

650
00:39:50.065 --> 00:39:51.653
Point in being alive's corner.

651
00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:55.277
Ugh, who do they make these for?

652
00:39:58.764 --> 00:40:00.144
Probably adults.

653
00:40:02.388 --> 00:40:03.838
[Jack sighs]

654
00:40:03.872 --> 00:40:07.289
Wait, so, if you
didn't die here,


655
00:40:07.324 --> 00:40:08.877
do you know why you're here?

656
00:40:12.432 --> 00:40:15.470
I thought that this
house was destined for me.


657
00:40:15.504 --> 00:40:17.886
They said that it called for me,

658
00:40:17.921 --> 00:40:20.337
that it had been waiting
all of these years

662

Huh, that's kind of like
this movie I saw once.


663

There was this guy who
couldn't remember anything,


664
00:40:36.249 --> 00:40:39.390
then there was this other guy
who wanted some people dead,


665
00:40:39.425 --> 00:40:41.772
so he used the guy who
couldn't remember anything


666
00:40:41.807 --> 00:40:43.256
by making him think
that he was the one

for revenge.

a little complicated,

to scare people off?

00:54:53.002 --> 00:54:54.659
and she was good in this house,

981
00:54:54.693 --> 00:54:57.627
and for over 200 years...

982
00:54:57.662 --> 00:55:00.630
she has been
one of our best agents....


983
00:55:02.805 --> 00:55:03.909
Until you.

984
00:55:05.842 --> 00:55:06.671
Why me?

985
00:55:06.705 --> 00:55:07.844
Don't know.

986
00:55:09.087 --> 00:55:10.882
I've asked several
of my colleagues


987
00:55:10.916 --> 00:55:13.609
and no one seems
to have any idea.


988
00:55:14.782 --> 00:55:16.232
What about you?

989
00:55:16.266 --> 00:55:18.061
Do you have a clue?

990
00:55:22.721 --> 00:55:24.136
No.

991
00:55:24.171 --> 00:55:26.276
When Muriel scared
you out of the house,


992
00:55:26.311 --> 00:55:28.347
why did you come back?

993
00:55:28.382 --> 00:55:31.005
'Cause I have a job to do.

994
00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.766
To clear out the house
for new people


995
00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.595
who Muriel will scare away.

996
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:36.183
And then you'll have to
clear out their stuff


997
00:55:36.217 --> 00:55:39.876
for new people
who Muriel will scare away.


998
00:55:39.911 --> 00:55:42.258
So let me ask you
your own question:


999
00:55:42.292 --> 00:55:44.812
why do you do what you do?

1000
00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:47.781
'Cause they pay me to.

1001
00:55:47.815 --> 00:55:49.058
[Ms Henry] Ah.

1002
00:55:49.092 --> 00:55:50.611
So money is the most
important thing to you.


1003
00:55:50.646 --> 00:55:52.164
No.

1004
00:55:52.199 --> 00:55:54.097
I mean I need it to live, but
I don't really care about it.


1005
00:55:54.132 --> 00:55:55.167
[Ms Henry] Oh,
so you would do this job


1006
00:55:55.202 --> 00:55:57.756
if they didn't pay you?

1007
00:55:57.791 --> 00:55:59.620
No. [chuckles]

1008
00:55:59.655 --> 00:56:00.587
I don't think so.

1009
00:56:01.864 --> 00:56:04.004
Maybe. I do enjoy cleaning
and fixing things.


1010
00:56:04.038 --> 00:56:06.213
It's kinda like
solving a puzzle.


1011
00:56:06.247 --> 00:56:10.769
You finish and you look at it
and you can say, "I did that."


1012
00:56:10.804 --> 00:56:13.358
So I guess if they provided
me with a place to stay


1013
00:56:13.392 --> 00:56:17.086
and maybe some money so
that I could afford to


1014
00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:19.260
get a drink or a movie or...

1015
00:56:19.295 --> 00:56:21.780
Actually, I don't even
care about that stuff.


1016
00:56:22.954 --> 00:56:24.956
I don't know why
I do what I do.

1017
00:56:26.405 --> 00:56:30.030
So if I ask you to leave
this house now, you would?


1018
00:56:31.031 --> 00:56:32.273
[Jack] No.

1019
00:56:32.308 --> 00:56:33.412
Why not?

1020
00:56:33.447 --> 00:56:35.173
You just said it, you
don't know why you're here.


1021
00:56:35.207 --> 00:56:37.209
No, I didn't say I
don't know why I'm here.


1022
00:56:37.244 --> 00:56:40.454
I said I don't know
why I do what I do.


1023
00:56:40.488 --> 00:56:43.146
[Ms Henry] So why are you here?

1024
00:56:43.975 --> 00:56:45.804
[heart beating]

1025
00:56:45.839 --> 00:56:46.840
'Cause...

1026
00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:53.018
Muriel's coming back.

1027
00:56:53.053 --> 00:56:56.332
And I want to spend
more time with her.


1028
00:56:56.366 --> 00:56:58.403
[soft music]

1029
00:56:58.437 --> 00:56:59.369
Ah.

1030
00:57:01.199 --> 00:57:06.273
[soft string music]
[heart beating]


1031
00:57:12.451 --> 00:57:14.799
[exhales]

1032
00:57:19.769 --> 00:57:23.324
[heavy breathing]
[soft music]


1033
00:57:23.359 --> 00:57:26.120
[Jack chuckles]

1034
00:57:28.295 --> 00:57:31.056
[phone ringing]

1035
00:57:35.543 --> 00:57:37.131
Neal?

1036
00:57:37.166 --> 00:57:38.408
[Neal] Hey Jack, I finally
heard back from the family.


1037
00:57:38.443 --> 00:57:41.170
They're sending someone out
tomorrow to pick up their stuff.


1038
00:57:41.204 --> 00:57:42.861
You'll be there, right?

1039
00:57:42.896 --> 00:57:44.242
Yeah.

1040
00:57:44.276 --> 00:57:47.452
[Neal] Great. How's it
all coming? You almost done?


1041
00:57:47.486 --> 00:57:48.487
Yeah, almost.

1042
00:57:48.522 --> 00:57:50.455
Hey, Neal, I...

1043
00:57:53.216 --> 00:57:54.459
Can I ask you a question?

1044
00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:58.912
[Neal] Uh yeah, s-sure.

1045
00:58:01.535 --> 00:58:04.469
How'd you know Annie
was the one?


1046
00:58:06.954 --> 00:58:09.370
[Neal sighs]

1047
00:58:09.405 --> 00:58:11.027
[Neal] Jack...

1048
00:58:11.062 --> 00:58:15.480
...that is not a question
you ask your boss.


1049
00:58:17.309 --> 00:58:18.759
I know, I just...

1050
00:58:20.485 --> 00:58:23.764
I don't really have
anyone else to ask.


1051
00:58:24.869 --> 00:58:27.906
[Neal] I...

1052
00:58:27.941 --> 00:58:30.322
Just call me when the house
is done, man.


1053
00:58:31.807 --> 00:58:32.739
[phone hanging up]

1054
00:58:34.154 --> 00:58:37.157
[soft synth music]

1055
00:58:47.408 --> 00:58:50.101
[Jack exhales]

1056
00:58:58.972 --> 00:59:00.559
You have no one.

1057
00:59:00.594 --> 00:59:01.871
[ominous music]

1058
00:59:01.906 --> 00:59:03.562
No one cares for you.

1059
00:59:03.597 --> 00:59:05.806
No one misses you.

1060
00:59:05.841 --> 00:59:07.774
No one thinks of you.

1061
00:59:10.397 --> 00:59:11.812
What are you doing?

1062
00:59:11.847 --> 00:59:13.572
You blame your suffering
on others,


1063
00:59:13.607 --> 00:59:15.989
but the fault lies in you.

1064
00:59:16.023 --> 00:59:19.095
[telepathically]
Some people fear failure.


1065
00:59:22.927 --> 00:59:26.344
Oh yeah, I know that.

1066
00:59:26.378 --> 00:59:27.552
I see around me.

1067
00:59:27.586 --> 00:59:29.623
Everybody else clearly has
this whole thing figured out


1068
00:59:29.657 --> 00:59:32.971
on a level that I
just don't understand.


1069
00:59:33.006 --> 00:59:35.422
I mean, I guess we're
all messes in some way


1070
00:59:35.456 --> 00:59:39.184
but I definitely feel a little
bit more broken than others.


1071
00:59:39.219 --> 00:59:40.945
Because you are!

1072
00:59:40.979 --> 00:59:42.947
Exactly.

1073
00:59:42.981 --> 00:59:44.465
Look at you.

1074
00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:46.882
You came in here and you're
just immediately a superstar.


1075
00:59:46.916 --> 00:59:48.159
You don't even know
how this shit works


1076
00:59:48.193 --> 00:59:49.298
and you're killin' it!

1077
00:59:49.332 --> 00:59:51.921
I...I know how this shit works.

1078
00:59:53.233 --> 00:59:54.441
What happened to your scars?

1079
00:59:54.475 --> 00:59:56.926
She abandoned them
for they were not hers.


1080
00:59:56.961 --> 00:59:58.479
Fake scars?

1081
00:59:58.514 --> 01:00:00.033
Lame.

1082
01:00:02.104 --> 01:00:03.312
This isn't working.

1083
01:00:03.346 --> 01:00:04.140
I don't like him.

1084
01:00:04.175 --> 01:00:05.383
Can I destroy him now?

1085
01:00:05.417 --> 01:00:08.317
You said you wanted
to learn, did you not?


1086
01:00:09.352 --> 01:00:10.250
Fine.

1087
01:00:13.391 --> 01:00:15.013
What does he know of scars?

1088
01:00:15.048 --> 01:00:16.359
He has not died.

1089
01:00:16.394 --> 01:00:17.498
Yeah.

1090
01:00:17.533 --> 01:00:20.260
- You know nothing of pain.
- Oh, I beg to differ.


1091
01:00:20.294 --> 01:00:23.125
You think death is pain, then
I think your life was soft.


1092
01:00:23.159 --> 01:00:24.643
You were so coddled
your entire life


1093
01:00:24.678 --> 01:00:26.231
that you have to imagine pain.

1094
01:00:26.266 --> 01:00:27.646
Put on fake scars.

1095
01:00:27.681 --> 01:00:30.408
Trot out some shit you
saw in a movie once.


1096
01:00:30.442 --> 01:00:31.512
You're a joke.

1097
01:00:31.547 --> 01:00:32.513
[Muriel] I disagree.

1098
01:00:32.548 --> 01:00:35.206
She died so young.
Of course she knows pain.


1099
01:00:36.034 --> 01:00:37.415
That's true.

1100
01:00:37.449 --> 01:00:39.348
How'd you die?

1101
01:00:39.382 --> 01:00:42.972
I was on a boat
with some friends,


1102
01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:45.319
and I got drunk and fell over.

1103
01:00:47.149 --> 01:00:49.254
Nobody helped you?

1104
01:00:49.289 --> 01:00:50.669
They were drunk, too.

1105
01:00:50.704 --> 01:00:51.705
Well that sucks.

1106
01:00:51.739 --> 01:00:53.017
I mean, I don't have
any friends,


1107
01:00:53.051 --> 01:00:54.121
but at least
I don't have friends


1108
01:00:54.156 --> 01:00:55.364
who'd let me die off a boat.

1109
01:00:55.398 --> 01:00:57.124
This isn't working.

1110
01:00:57.159 --> 01:00:58.574
Your whole thing isn't working.

1111
01:00:58.608 --> 01:01:00.265
He's not scared at all.

1112
01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.440
Oh, on the contrary,
I'm pretty terrified.


1113
01:01:02.474 --> 01:01:03.372
Shut up!

1114
01:01:04.476 --> 01:01:06.375
I want to hurt him.

1115
01:01:06.409 --> 01:01:08.446
That is not what we do.

1116
01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:09.688
Why not?

1117
01:01:09.723 --> 01:01:11.069
Why can't it be?

1118
01:01:11.104 --> 01:01:12.657
I want to make him hurt.

1119
01:01:12.691 --> 01:01:15.625
I want to drag him upstairs
and drown him in the tub.


1120
01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.041
[Muriel] What would
that accomplish?


1121
01:01:17.075 --> 01:01:18.042
I would feel better.

1122
01:01:18.076 --> 01:01:20.320
That is not what this is about.

1123
01:01:21.183 --> 01:01:24.531
[tense, dramatic music]

1124
01:01:30.537 --> 01:01:32.228
Uh oh.

1125
01:01:32.263 --> 01:01:34.506
What if they bring in
somebody even younger


1126
01:01:34.541 --> 01:01:37.095
than you to replace you?

1127
01:01:39.132 --> 01:01:41.134
This is bullshit.

1128
01:01:41.168 --> 01:01:45.517
You're bullshit,
and you're bullshit.


1129
01:01:45.552 --> 01:01:48.210
I'm out of here, and you can
just be BULLSHIT together!


1130
01:01:48.244 --> 01:01:50.005
Humility is the first step

1131
01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:52.248
on the path to
self-actualization.


1132
01:01:52.283 --> 01:01:53.940
Fuck you!

1133
01:02:02.672 --> 01:02:04.398
Well that was fun. [laughs]

1134
01:02:04.433 --> 01:02:06.055
We should not have done that.

1135
01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:07.298
What?

1136
01:02:07.332 --> 01:02:08.782
Why?

1137
01:02:08.816 --> 01:02:10.473
I thought we agreed
she needed to go.


1138
01:02:10.508 --> 01:02:12.441
I was supposed to work with her.

1139
01:02:12.475 --> 01:02:14.270
Help her.

1140
01:02:14.305 --> 01:02:15.996
Yeah, but only because
people who don't

1155

A lot.

1156
01:02:53.206 --> 01:02:54.828
More than I've ever
cared about anyone,


1157
01:02:54.862 --> 01:02:57.451
which is weird,
'cause you're a ghost,


1158

which are apparently real.

1159

So what the fuck do I know?

1160
01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:04.113
In fact here, here's the truth.

1161
01:03:06.529 --> 01:03:08.669
It's not because
I want to help you.

I just wanna be with you.

You cannot.

Why?

1165
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:29.276
Because that is not
how things are done.


1166
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:33.280
You guys are all so concerned
with how things


1167

are supposed to go.

1168

Shit goes sideways, that's...

1169
01:03:43.118 --> 01:03:46.466
Ms Henry..Ms Henry
told me how you died.


1170
01:03:48.295 --> 01:03:52.092
And I know it doesn't change
anything, but I'm sorry...


1171
01:03:52.127 --> 01:03:53.714
that life was so cruel to you.

1172
01:03:53.749 --> 01:03:56.545
Mine's been pretty shitty
so far,


1173
01:03:56.579 --> 01:03:58.823
but I think it's worse
when life convinces you


1174
01:03:58.857 --> 01:04:01.101
that it's going to be fair
and it's not.


1175
01:04:02.861 --> 01:04:06.141
And life isn't going to
say it's sorry, so...


1176
01:04:07.694 --> 01:04:09.454
I will, I'm sorry.

1177
01:04:14.666 --> 01:04:17.600
It is not that
I want you to go.

1178
01:04:19.326 --> 01:04:22.709
I enjoy being good at my job.

1179
01:04:22.743 --> 01:04:27.541
I do not always know why
I do it, to what end,


1180
01:04:27.576 --> 01:04:30.579
but I like the doing of it.

1181
01:04:30.613 --> 01:04:33.892
And if you stay here,
I may never recover


1182
01:04:33.927 --> 01:04:36.516
from the demerit
I will be assessed.


1183

[Jack] Wait, what does
that mean? What demerit?


1184
01:04:38.897 --> 01:04:41.245
If I allow a living person
to stay in this house,


1185
01:04:41.279 --> 01:04:43.557
I will become a shadow.

1186
01:04:43.592 --> 01:04:45.766
Like a literal shadow?

1187
01:04:45.801 --> 01:04:47.182
Shadows are ghosts?

1188
01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:49.598
No, that is not...

1189
01:04:49.632 --> 01:04:51.738
A shadow...

1190
01:04:51.772 --> 01:04:56.225
has no control over where
it goes or what it does.


1191
01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:59.504
A shadow cannot
say what it wants.


1192
01:05:00.919 --> 01:05:02.749
A shadow is nothing.

1193
01:05:03.853 --> 01:05:08.410
I would be nothing.

1194
01:05:08.444 --> 01:05:12.448
[Jack] I thought
nothingness isn't an option.


1195
01:05:12.483 --> 01:05:17.764
No, I am not, I am not
explaining this well. Um...


1196
01:05:17.798 --> 01:05:21.492
If you care about me
as much as you say you do,


1197

and they are thankless,


1201
01:05:35.851 --> 01:05:38.957

what I do has no point.


1202
01:05:38.992 --> 01:05:40.925
Yeah, but what I do has no point

point, we can at least
