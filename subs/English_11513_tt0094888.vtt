1
00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:02.976
That will cost you money.

2
00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:06.911
Ladies and gentlemen...

3
00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:11.575
...you'll have to pay up...

4
00:00:11.713 --> 00:00:16.509
... if you want me to sing
the ballad of Francisco Manoel...


5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.211
...the bandit of Cobra Verde...

6
00:00:21.346 --> 00:00:24.404
...the poorest of the poor...

7
00:00:25.947 --> 00:00:28.345
...the master of the slaves...

8
00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:35.111
It was he who became the Viceroy.

9
00:00:36.683 --> 00:00:39.876
It was he who was
the Alonest of the alone.


10
00:00:47.596 --> 00:00:49.524
<i>Francisco Manoel's mother sighs,</i>

11
00:00:49.626 --> 00:00:51.983
<i>Francisco, I feel only aches and dread.</i>

12
00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:53.979
<i>Francisco Manoel's mother cries</i>

13
00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:56.565
<i>Francisco, leave me.
I will soon be dead.</i>


14
00:00:57.774 --> 00:01:01.629
<i>Eleven years of drought,
the rocks are sick.</i>


15
00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:05.620
<i>The world is dying.
Evil is a trick.</i>


16
00:01:20.257 --> 00:01:24.178
<i>I will die now. Be quiet,
or the bench will crack from sadness.</i>


17
00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:25.799
<i>Do not move. 
Stay still.</i>

18
00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:28.632
<i>The water, the earth
and the sun turn black.</i>


19
00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:31.663
<i>God in His Perplexity,
pretends it's His Will.</i>


20
00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:35.917
<i>Francisco, traveling,
reads a line in the sky.</i>


21
00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:38.380
<i>''Don't set your eyes
on the salt sea shore.</i>


22
00:01:38.484 --> 00:01:40.908
<i>Don't reason. Don't argue.
Don't ask us why.</i>


23
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.799
Fate will send you a lover,
and one friend more.''


24
00:02:49.992 --> 00:02:54.880
<i>Based on the novel
''The Viceroy of Ouidah'' by Bruce Chatwin</i>


25
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.338
<i>His Royal Highness
Nana Agyefi Kwamell of Nsein</i>


26
00:03:15.867 --> 00:03:20.357
<i>and with the girls
of the Zigi Cultural Troupe Ho Ziavi</i>


27
00:05:37.617 --> 00:05:39.243
Where's my money?!

28
00:05:41.284 --> 00:05:46.080
Where's my money?! Where are
my partners?! Where's my money?!


29
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.074
Keep moving! Next?

30
00:05:55.184 --> 00:05:57.945
What the hell are you doing here?
There's no money for you!


31
00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.345
What? No! I can't believe it!

32
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.246
You know you don't get
any wages this week.


33
00:06:01.351 --> 00:06:04.874
The bank kept it all! Get out!

34
00:06:05.983 --> 00:06:07.813
There's no place here
for blood suckers.


35
00:06:07.917 --> 00:06:10.213
You bastard! You cheated me!

36
00:06:15.582 --> 00:06:18.070
I want you awake when you die!

37
00:06:37.048 --> 00:06:41.277
It's Cobra Verde, the bandit!
Get the children in a safe place!


38
00:06:56.047 --> 00:06:58.207
Go on, get it into the church!

39
00:08:41.711 --> 00:08:44.369
That rifle stays outside!

40
00:08:45.409 --> 00:08:49.241
Now, get that thing out of here,
or I'll throw you out!


41
00:09:01.143 --> 00:09:07.166
I want something to eat!
Tell your parents Cobra Verde is here!


42
00:09:07.276 --> 00:09:13.435
I have no parents! This is my bar,
and you don't frighten me!


43
00:09:21.976 --> 00:09:24.737
My name is Francisco Manoel.

44
00:09:25.475 --> 00:09:28.634
And my name is Euclides...

45
00:09:28.741 --> 00:09:34.901
Euclides Alves da Silva
Pernambucano Wandereley.


46
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:38.769
I'm a da Silva too.

47
00:09:41.175 --> 00:09:44.607
It's only my chest and shoulders
that are crooked- at night...


48
00:09:44.708 --> 00:09:48.767
I always dream I have to carry
a whole mountain range on my back.


49
00:09:50.708 --> 00:09:54.072
You stand straighter
than the whole town!


50
00:09:55.075 --> 00:09:59.529
- I'm hungry.
- I'll bring you some food.


51
00:10:22.739 --> 00:10:25.104
How do you know all these things?

52
00:10:25.406 --> 00:10:30.134
From our priest,
and he learned them from our Bishop.


53
00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:33.703
And where does the snow come from?

54
00:10:34.106 --> 00:10:36.400
You'll see it out there!

55
00:10:36.504 --> 00:10:39.665
There's always snow on the moon!

56
00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:42.703
That's why it's always white!
White and cold.


57
00:10:42.838 --> 00:10:45.464
You have to look very carefully.

58
00:10:46.372 --> 00:10:47.769
Why is that?

59
00:10:48.304 --> 00:10:53.601
It's because the moon...
takes the water out of the ocean.


60
00:10:53.705 --> 00:10:55.069
And when night falls...

61
00:10:55.172 --> 00:10:58.605
the tips of the mountains
attract the snowflakes.


62
00:10:58.706 --> 00:11:03.330
But only as much salt
as we have in our tears.


63
00:11:05.971 --> 00:11:07.062
And here on earth?

64
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:11.500
It's very far away-
you must keep going west.


65
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.932
Four years in horseback...
and ten on foot.


66
00:11:16.037 --> 00:11:19.469
And after that,
there are high mountains.


67
00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:23.559
They rise higher and higher-
right over the clouds.


68
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.103
And then above the clouds,
then you find the snow.


69
00:11:27.203 --> 00:11:29.761
It only falls in the night-time.

70
00:11:29.904 --> 00:11:36.665
Just like feathers. But it only falls...
from above the clouds.


71
00:11:37.036 --> 00:11:41.525
And then the whole world
turns light as feather-


72
00:11:41.903 --> 00:11:44.300
and snow white!

73
00:11:46.636 --> 00:11:51.591
Even the lions turn white...
and the eagles...


74
00:11:51.736 --> 00:11:53.964
the rabbits get a snowy coat...

75
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.502
and all the animals
in the world turn white!


76
00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:02.264
And when you're walking
through the snow...


77
00:12:02.402 --> 00:12:06.493
your feet don't weigh anything at all.

78
00:12:07.668 --> 00:12:11.862
And the little snowflakes,
go flying up in the air...


79
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.623
just like feathers.

80
00:12:27.635 --> 00:12:30.930
In a year or so,
I'm going to sell this bar.


81
00:12:31.034 --> 00:12:35.126
And then go west,
and climb up the mountains.


82
00:12:39.068 --> 00:12:41.533
I'm going east to the sea.

83
00:12:42.133 --> 00:12:46.189
The Sertao dries our hearts,
and kills the cattle.


84
00:12:47.334 --> 00:12:50.493
You'd better be very careful
when you go to the sea...


85
00:12:50.599 --> 00:12:52.929
it's where the tempests are born...

86
00:12:53.033 --> 00:12:55.158
and the snowflakes
have their cradle.


87
00:12:55.267 --> 00:12:58.596
That's what the reverend father said!

88
00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:23.560
I never had a
friend in all my life...

89
00:13:26.532 --> 00:13:27.691
Farewell.

90
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.920
Your money or your life!

91
00:14:33.429 --> 00:14:34.918
My life.

92
00:15:52.193 --> 00:15:57.284
Every day... you walk forty miles
through the thorns...


93
00:15:57.859 --> 00:16:02.086
And why are you barefoot?
Don't you have any shoes?


94
00:16:04.259 --> 00:16:06.156
I don't trust shoes.

95
00:16:06.258 --> 00:16:09.248
And why don't you have a horse?

96
00:16:10.992 --> 00:16:15.618
I'd never trust a horse.
And I don't trust people either.


97
00:16:16.925 --> 00:16:20.790
But I long to go forth
from here to another world.


98
00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:25.248
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

99
00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:39.210
Don't run away.
It'll only be worse for you.


100
00:17:42.588 --> 00:17:44.178
Let him go!

101
00:17:45.821 --> 00:17:48.617
He can find the post by himself!

102
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:33.177
Hey, you with the bare feet.
What's your name?


103
00:18:36.186 --> 00:18:40.913
Da Silva...
Francisco Manoel da Silva.


104
00:18:41.252 --> 00:18:46.809
I am Colonel Octavio Cotinho.
I need a man like you.


105
00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:49.749
I have six hundred slaves
in my sugar fields...


106
00:18:49.852 --> 00:18:52.317
and my overseer is an idiot.

107
00:18:54.485 --> 00:18:57.508
No one... grows more sugar than I do.

108
00:19:37.951 --> 00:19:40.677
Now, if that's not enough,
you can always ask for more.


109
00:19:40.783 --> 00:19:42.772
I've never had
this many clothes before.


110
00:19:42.883 --> 00:19:46.644
You know, when I think
there are still some fields not planted...


111
00:19:46.783 --> 00:19:48.772
with my sugar cane.

112
00:19:49.216 --> 00:19:52.874
It makes me even madder
to think there are meadows...


113
00:19:54.016 --> 00:19:56.380
where my cattle aren't grazing!

114
00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.548
And when I think of
all the mulatto girls...


115
00:20:03.649 --> 00:20:06.877
I haven't made pregnant yet, why,
that's quite beyond endurance.


116
00:20:06.983 --> 00:20:10.142
Better watch out for the ladies,
my friend!


117
00:20:10.982 --> 00:20:12.777
And when do I start work?

118
00:20:12.882 --> 00:20:16.609
Oh, there's no hurry.
I'll show you everything.


119
00:20:43.581 --> 00:20:45.376
You'll be the overseer here.

120
00:20:45.481 --> 00:20:48.469
We harvest twice a year,
it's that fertile.


121
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.479
I've got another forty sugar
plantations just like this one.


122
00:20:52.681 --> 00:20:56.669
I alone produce more sugar than
the whole state of Pernambuco.


123
00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.008
A hundred thousand tons per year.

124
00:21:00.314 --> 00:21:03.439
And all of it goes to England,
our enemy.


125
00:21:03.547 --> 00:21:07.911
They've abolished the slave trade.
They seize our ships.


126
00:21:08.013 --> 00:21:10.479
And yet, without us they
wouldn't have any sugar.


127
00:21:10.579 --> 00:21:12.307
And the way they buy the sugar...

128
00:21:12.414 --> 00:21:15.136
you'd think our rivers were
overflowing with the stuff.


129
00:21:15.213 --> 00:21:16.479
Hah, it's grotesque.

130
00:21:17.247 --> 00:21:19.643
You'll be in charge here, too.

131
00:21:20.645 --> 00:21:22.475
This is where we squeeze
out the sugar cane...


132
00:21:22.578 --> 00:21:24.340
and this is where
the juice is thickened.


133
00:21:24.446 --> 00:21:27.207
We heat the molasses up to
a hundred and twenty degrees.


134
00:21:27.313 --> 00:21:29.869
At this stage it's still a thin syrup.

135
00:21:29.978 --> 00:21:34.503
In a couple of hours the
molasses will start to crystallize.


136
00:21:35.679 --> 00:21:38.804
This is no easy task- every now
and then one of the workers...


137
00:21:38.912 --> 00:21:40.344
collapses from the fumes.

138
00:21:40.446 --> 00:21:42.138
But we've got enough of them.

139
00:21:42.245 --> 00:21:45.905
As you see here we're ladling it
from one tub to another.


140
00:22:28.244 --> 00:22:30.607
Don't run away.
Get a machete. Hurry!


141
00:22:37.209 --> 00:22:40.300
We're going to have to
hack another arm off!


142
00:22:41.076 --> 00:22:42.542
Is there nothing we can do?

143
00:22:42.643 --> 00:22:44.972
Oh, this sort of thing
happens all the time.


144
00:23:05.142 --> 00:23:10.438
How very strange. I haven't bred
any children yet today.


145
00:23:10.541 --> 00:23:12.905
Come on. Come on then!

146
00:24:24.973 --> 00:24:28.460
Hey, Francisco Manoel...
don't your shoes fit?


147
00:24:41.138 --> 00:24:45.094
Tell me, did you ever learn
how to use a knife and fork?


148
00:25:04.836 --> 00:25:07.631
The man from Santao doesn't
talk to just anyone!


149
00:25:07.736 --> 00:25:10.100
How many cows did you own?

150
00:26:29.334 --> 00:26:33.790
I have nothing to lose.
I don't have to talk to anybody!


151
00:27:24.364 --> 00:27:28.922
I'll kill the lot of you!
My daughters are all whores.


152
00:27:29.032 --> 00:27:32.429
Rutting with a barefoot cowherd!
Bonita you whore!


153
00:27:32.531 --> 00:27:38.395
Bonita! Bonita! You filthy
little bitch! Bonita pregnant!


154
00:27:38.498 --> 00:27:40.623
My little Bonita pregnant!

155
00:27:40.765 --> 00:27:44.787
Wandeleide! Only fifteen years old
and she's pregnant!


156
00:27:44.931 --> 00:27:49.521
Valkyria! Valkyria! Valkyria!

157
00:27:49.629 --> 00:27:53.154
Valkyria, look me in the eye
and tell me the truth!


158
00:27:53.263 --> 00:27:54.991
Are you pregnant too? Well!

159
00:27:55.097 --> 00:27:58.688
No, I mean yes.
Daddy, I don't know!


160
00:27:58.797 --> 00:28:05.696
Cowherd! Bastard! You!!!
What have you got to say for yourself!


161
00:28:08.462 --> 00:28:14.622
Sugarcane planter.
I am the bandit Cobra Verde.


162
00:28:21.728 --> 00:28:25.093
An outlaw in my own house!

163
00:28:26.595 --> 00:28:31.460
A thief, a bandit, a criminal!

164
00:28:32.461 --> 00:28:34.393
Let's put him on trial.

165
00:28:35.395 --> 00:28:36.726
Just kill him.

166
00:28:36.829 --> 00:28:39.123
The man's too dangerous.

167
00:28:40.228 --> 00:28:44.094
We'd have three or four dead
before we finished him off.


168
00:28:44.395 --> 00:28:47.555
Why not marry him off to
one of your daughters?


169
00:28:47.662 --> 00:28:50.889
After all, isn't he the best man
on your plantation?


170
00:28:51.394 --> 00:28:52.883
I'd have done that...

171
00:28:52.994 --> 00:28:56.018
if the swine hadn't made
all three of them pregnant.


172
00:28:56.128 --> 00:28:58.491
Send him to Africa to buy slaves.

173
00:28:58.594 --> 00:29:00.457
What do you mean : ''buy slaves''?

174
00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.355
We haven't had a slave from
Africa in the last ten years.


175
00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.449
That's just the point.

176
00:29:08.294 --> 00:29:10.886
We send him to a certain death.

177
00:29:10.994 --> 00:29:13.323
The King of Dahomey is mad.

178
00:29:13.427 --> 00:29:17.154
Anyone who sets foot on
his territory is killed on the spot!


179
00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.784
Not one single white man has
come back alive from there...


180
00:29:20.894 --> 00:29:22.984
in the last ten years.

181
00:29:24.893 --> 00:29:29.416
And what if... and what if
the scum does manage it!


182
00:29:30.159 --> 00:29:32.182
He'll never make it. 
I know Africa.

183
00:29:32.293 --> 00:29:33.485
I know the Bight of Benin.

184
00:29:33.592 --> 00:29:37.150
And if he does make it,
he'll bring back so many slaves...


185
00:29:37.293 --> 00:29:40.520
you can extend your plantations
all the way to Sergipe.


186
00:29:41.559 --> 00:29:44.150
Why don't you give him your
oldest daughter to marry?


187
00:29:44.293 --> 00:29:47.053
Yes! Use him any way you can.

188
00:29:47.358 --> 00:29:51.950
And as for the other two girls...
well, surely you can find...


189
00:29:52.058 --> 00:29:54.684
some sort of husband for them.

190
00:29:54.792 --> 00:29:56.587
If that doesn't appeal to you...

191
00:29:56.692 --> 00:29:59.987
send them to the Carmelite Sisters.
The choice is yours.


192
00:30:00.291 --> 00:30:02.622
I'll kill that pig!

193
00:30:02.725 --> 00:30:06.020
I'll arrange everything
with my friend the governor.


194
00:30:15.692 --> 00:30:19.350
Da Silva... we have
a special assignment...


195
00:30:19.457 --> 00:30:22.514
which we can entrust
only to a capable man.


196
00:30:27.658 --> 00:30:30.623
This is an official certificate
entitling you to practice...


197
00:30:30.723 --> 00:30:31.711
the slave trade.

198
00:30:31.823 --> 00:30:34.585
As you know, this trade
has fallen into stagnation.


199
00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:37.212
The King of Dahomey
has cut off our supplies...


200
00:30:37.323 --> 00:30:39.654
but we know he needs
weapons and money.


201
00:30:39.858 --> 00:30:42.118
So, we propose the following :...

202
00:30:42.223 --> 00:30:46.350
we will send you to our
Fort Elmina in Dahomey.


203
00:30:46.924 --> 00:30:49.719
You will have rank as a lieutenant.

204
00:30:49.823 --> 00:30:52.790
Your wages will be held for you
here in a special bank account...


205
00:30:52.891 --> 00:30:53.913
in Bahia.

206
00:30:54.023 --> 00:30:58.388
In five months' time, a ship with
a cargo of munitions will arrive.


207
00:30:58.523 --> 00:31:00.488
You can pay the king with that.

208
00:31:00.589 --> 00:31:02.885
We've also thought about Angola...

209
00:31:02.988 --> 00:31:05.780
but the English Navy
have it blockaded.


210
00:31:05.923 --> 00:31:08.821
Sailing around the Cape to
the east coast of Africa...


211
00:31:08.923 --> 00:31:12.150
is impossible because the Arabs
monopolize the slave trade...


212
00:31:12.255 --> 00:31:14.221
from Zanzibar on down.

213
00:31:15.289 --> 00:31:18.016
The situation looks very
promising at this time...


214
00:31:18.122 --> 00:31:22.145
because the King of Dahomey
is involved in a war with the Egbas.


215
00:31:22.255 --> 00:31:26.210
And that means that he needs us
just as much as we need him.


216
00:31:26.955 --> 00:31:29.649
When did you last
receive information?


217
00:31:29.755 --> 00:31:34.050
It's been a long time since
we received any messages.


218
00:31:34.154 --> 00:31:37.917
And we can't trust those
reports that we do get.


219
00:31:38.054 --> 00:31:39.680
Will you accept our offer?

220
00:31:45.154 --> 00:31:46.142
Yes.

221
00:31:48.021 --> 00:31:49.850
Congratulations.

222
00:31:51.554 --> 00:31:56.247
Here's your commission,
and the best of luck to you.


223
00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.851
We've got a ship to outfit
for a long ocean journey.


224
00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:14.249
Elmina, West Africa

225
00:32:17.087 --> 00:32:23.552
Brazilian slave fortress in the country
of the sinister, demented King of Dahomey


226
00:32:38.984 --> 00:32:41.850
Put me ashore- and give me
ten rifles to take along.


227
00:32:44.251 --> 00:32:46.876
None of my crew would dare take you.

228
00:32:46.984 --> 00:32:49.213
I can't force them.
We'll just have to wait...


229
00:32:49.318 --> 00:32:51.614
... and see if the Africans
will come and fetch you.


230
00:32:51.718 --> 00:32:58.082
Nobody there- what's the matter.
Here, take the telescope.


231
00:32:58.184 --> 00:33:00.412
The fort seems dead to the world.

232
00:33:07.618 --> 00:33:11.174
Usually they send out
one of their fetish priests...


233
00:33:11.917 --> 00:33:14.349
praying for us to capsize in the surf.

234
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:17.847
All flotsam is the property of the king.

235
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:22.882
I've even seen them strip
a half-drowned sailor naked.


236
00:33:22.983 --> 00:33:24.949
We'll just have to wait
and see what happens.


237
00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:26.981
Thus far, Africa's quite
a disappointment.


238
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:17.236
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!


239
00:37:17.341 --> 00:37:22.637
Where is the barge full of silk?
And the coach and the horses?


240
00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:28.068
What about the trumpets? And
what about the silver hunting rifles?


241
00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.765
There will be no gifts.

242
00:37:31.206 --> 00:37:33.070
Not even greyhounds?

243
00:37:35.207 --> 00:37:37.434
Not even greyhounds.

244
00:37:37.939 --> 00:37:41.031
There will be no gifts until your
king resumes the slave trade.


245
00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.935
And turns over the fort to me.

246
00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.367
Give me one of those rifles.

247
00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.101
I'll make payment with rifles.

248
00:37:57.373 --> 00:38:00.066
The powder we have here
takes a long time to speak-


249
00:38:00.172 --> 00:38:02.364
- yours speaks at once.
- Keep it then.


250
00:38:03.138 --> 00:38:06.071
Death to the white men!
Death to the white men!


251
00:38:44.937 --> 00:38:46.800
You can live here if you like.

252
00:38:46.904 --> 00:38:49.699
The west wing's in
reasonable condition.


253
00:38:52.237 --> 00:38:55.725
And... you can help yourself
to one of my daughters.


254
00:38:55.837 --> 00:38:59.292
She could... She could
live in the castle with you.


255
00:38:59.637 --> 00:39:01.865
Are you running a brothel, or what?

256
00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:04.764
No. I mean I'm doing this for free.

257
00:39:05.003 --> 00:39:07.435
I need something to live on after all...

258
00:39:07.569 --> 00:39:09.899
but I only do this for white men.

259
00:39:10.003 --> 00:39:13.992
And you're the first one
who's come here... for a long time.


260
00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.928
Mother of Jesus Christ and all
the saints be praised!


261
00:41:27.831 --> 00:41:30.421
I am Taparica, the drum major...

262
00:41:30.529 --> 00:41:32.587
the only survivor of the garrison.

263
00:41:32.697 --> 00:41:34.424
I'm a free Yoruba...

264
00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:37.427
and I served in the First Regiment
of the Black Militia.


265
00:41:37.529 --> 00:41:40.156
Shall I show you where I live?

266
00:41:50.362 --> 00:41:52.159
This is my home...

267
00:41:53.363 --> 00:41:55.920
and these are
my brothers and sisters.


268
00:42:15.328 --> 00:42:16.817
What happened here?

269
00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:20.385
It all started very strangely.

270
00:42:20.594 --> 00:42:24.050
They say the king in Abomey
is a little soft in the head.


271
00:42:24.528 --> 00:42:26.720
He found slavery
to be a bad idea.


272
00:42:26.828 --> 00:42:28.521
Instead of sending us slaves...

273
00:42:28.628 --> 00:42:31.924
one day he sent us a
horse with only one ear.


274
00:42:32.028 --> 00:42:33.721
Then they attacked us.

275
00:42:33.961 --> 00:42:38.053
The governor was killed outright
in a skirmish on the coast.


276
00:42:38.161 --> 00:42:41.490
Then they overran the fort
and plundered everything.


277
00:42:41.594 --> 00:42:45.049
The Black Militia ran away, and
all the whites were murdered.


278
00:42:45.161 --> 00:42:47.127
The skulls of the prisoners...

279
00:42:47.228 --> 00:42:49.852
are now decorating the walls
of the Palace in Abomey.


280
00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.323
They looted everything,
stole the bells...


281
00:42:52.426 --> 00:42:56.791
and poked the eyes out of all the
portraits in the main building.


282
00:42:58.027 --> 00:43:01.753
Then... they broke open the
rum barrels one by one...


283
00:43:01.859 --> 00:43:03.519
and drank the lot!

284
00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:07.115
They grabbed a cadet and
raped him in the courtyard.


285
00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:17.258
They put ants on my chest...
pepper under my eyelids.


286
00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:21.519
They burnt my tongue because they
claimed we were hiding a treasure.


287
00:43:21.626 --> 00:43:25.081
They were just about to do their
worst when someone exploded...


288
00:43:25.193 --> 00:43:27.487
the powder magazine with
a lighted torch.


289
00:43:28.826 --> 00:43:31.587
They took seven corpses
from the wreckage...


290
00:43:31.726 --> 00:43:34.453
... and after that
they left me in peace.


291
00:44:41.123 --> 00:44:43.953
We do not know
who is buried where...


292
00:44:47.623 --> 00:44:51.681
but I think this grave here
is the Governor's.


293
00:44:54.289 --> 00:44:56.414
Why did you come...

294
00:44:58.788 --> 00:45:02.447
all alone... without any soldiers?

295
00:45:03.089 --> 00:45:06.145
Aren't you afraid...?
Aren't you afraid of dying...?


296
00:45:06.255 --> 00:45:07.949
I never tried it.

297
00:45:28.621 --> 00:45:30.484
What do we do now?

298
00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.277
We wait.

299
00:48:00.749 --> 00:48:02.805
Careful with that! Keep it up.

300
00:48:07.048 --> 00:48:10.810
I've never seen a
white man work before!


301
00:48:17.013 --> 00:48:20.571
Get out of my way!
I've got to hold up the front!


302
00:50:31.808 --> 00:50:33.331
Spiritus sanctus...

303
00:50:37.108 --> 00:50:38.096
sanctus...

304
00:50:38.208 --> 00:50:40.299
Come on, let me through here...!

305
00:50:40.643 --> 00:50:43.835
You filthy pig! I don't want to
see you here anymore.


306
00:50:43.941 --> 00:50:45.998
Get out, and stay out!

307
00:51:24.673 --> 00:51:27.730
Only three hundred slaves?
That doesn't make full use...


308
00:51:27.839 --> 00:51:31.066
of the hold capacity, but
it's better than nothing.


309
00:51:31.672 --> 00:51:34.763
Our friends in Brazil will be surprised.

310
00:51:35.039 --> 00:51:38.027
Of course twenty per cent of
the sales price will be paid...


311
00:51:38.138 --> 00:51:39.866
into your bank account.

312
00:51:50.706 --> 00:51:52.195
Have you got any firearms?

313
00:51:52.306 --> 00:51:54.101
One hundred and forty
with ammunition.


314
00:51:54.206 --> 00:51:55.193
Silk?

315
00:51:55.305 --> 00:51:57.294
Five bales. lt isn't the best quality...

316
00:51:57.405 --> 00:51:59.234
but here they don't
know the difference.


317
00:51:59.339 --> 00:52:00.361
Rum?

318
00:52:00.471 --> 00:52:01.902
Ten barrels.

319
00:52:03.638 --> 00:52:05.070
How about tobacco?

320
00:52:05.172 --> 00:52:09.467
Unfortunately it got damp and
we had to throw it overboard.


321
00:52:15.037 --> 00:52:18.730
Next time you'll have to bring...
more firearms.


322
00:52:19.471 --> 00:52:23.403
Has that war with the Egbas
flared up again?


323
00:52:27.171 --> 00:52:30.830
The information that
gets here is... incomplete...


324
00:52:30.937 --> 00:52:33.095
We have to rely on guess-work.

325
00:52:36.237 --> 00:52:38.828
May I make a... personal remark.

326
00:52:38.936 --> 00:52:40.266
Go ahead.

327
00:52:41.803 --> 00:52:44.860
We tried to... if I might say so...

328
00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:48.959
consider all the possibilities
when we sent you down here.


329
00:52:49.436 --> 00:52:54.199
But we never expected...
to see you again...


330
00:52:55.203 --> 00:52:58.226
Why do you suppose
they're sending you slaves?


331
00:52:59.537 --> 00:53:01.797
I suppose they need me.

332
00:53:38.168 --> 00:53:41.861
You can best guess their age...
from their teeth.


333
00:53:55.568 --> 00:53:58.397
Actually they're lucky.
We're saving their lives.


334
00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:01.697
During their annual ceremonies, their
customs would have them sacrificed


335
00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:03.262
to the king's ancestors as messengers.

336
00:54:03.367 --> 00:54:05.764
They'd be dispatched
to the other world.


337
00:54:05.867 --> 00:54:09.923
But now we are sending
them to a wonderful land...


338
00:54:10.032 --> 00:54:13.430
where the cigars grow on trees
and everyone dances.


339
00:54:25.099 --> 00:54:26.861
Find out what's going on!

340
00:54:44.865 --> 00:54:48.729
It is Bossa. Bossa Gelele.
He's the king's older brother.


341
00:54:48.831 --> 00:54:52.285
All men and children with the
first name Bossa are to be killed.


342
00:54:52.398 --> 00:54:55.128
The king can't stand to have
anyone else in his domain...


343
00:54:55.232 --> 00:54:56.729
with his first name, Bossa.

344
00:54:56.831 --> 00:54:59.525
His name is Bossa, Bossa Ahadee.

345
00:55:00.332 --> 00:55:03.196
He knows customs won't allow
him to kill his own brother...


346
00:55:03.298 --> 00:55:04.990
of the solid soil of his kingdom.

347
00:55:05.097 --> 00:55:08.496
That's why he's being taken out
to the sea to be drowned.


348
00:56:22.727 --> 00:56:26.955
White man, when the king searches
for someone, he can't hide.


349
00:56:27.394 --> 00:56:29.985
Even if he flees beneath the earth...

350
00:56:30.161 --> 00:56:32.024
the ground will talk!

351
00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:41.389
The leopard has begotten
a son with a female human.


352
00:56:41.794 --> 00:56:43.453
The leopards mighty claw...

353
00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:46.890
has left an indelible mark
on the child's temples.


354
00:56:47.027 --> 00:56:49.491
Now the holy... 
Leopard's son...

355
00:56:49.593 --> 00:56:52.559
declares that he
loves the white man.


356
00:56:52.726 --> 00:56:55.215
Is the white man in good health?

357
00:56:56.227 --> 00:56:59.193
The new white man
comes from across the sea.


358
00:56:59.593 --> 00:57:01.525
He has seen many things.

359
00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:05.083
The king has prepared a
king's road for him.


360
00:57:05.193 --> 00:57:07.749
The king wishes to see the stranger.

361
00:57:12.859 --> 00:57:16.690
The king has dictated this message
for you to his royal scribe.


362
00:57:20.892 --> 00:57:22.153
I am Portuguese...

363
00:57:22.259 --> 00:57:25.088
held captive by this horrible king
these last sixteen years.


364
00:57:25.191 --> 00:57:27.248
He does not know I am
writing this. Beware!


365
00:57:27.359 --> 00:57:30.325
If you come here, you're a dead man.

366
00:57:30.625 --> 00:57:34.751
Tell his majesty... I must always
have one foot in the sea...


367
00:57:34.959 --> 00:57:36.481
I cannot come.

368
00:57:36.658 --> 00:57:37.987
Seize him.

369
01:00:27.251 --> 01:00:30.315
Abomey
Residence of the King


370
01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:26.940
I wish I had your skin.

371
01:01:27.649 --> 01:01:30.705
The black people believe
the Devil is white.


372
01:04:41.608 --> 01:04:43.733
The leopard has risen.

373
01:04:46.073 --> 01:04:48.199
The leopard takes his seat.

374
01:04:51.041 --> 01:04:55.666
Dada, breathe for me! Dada, steal
from me. Dada, break my bones.


375
01:04:56.373 --> 01:05:00.829
Take me! My head is yours.
My body is yours. Take me.


376
01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:05.829
It's yours. I'm all yours.
Dada! Please!


377
01:05:09.473 --> 01:05:13.595
The bush king takes his seat.

378
01:05:22.106 --> 01:05:24.128
What does that mean?

379
01:05:27.139 --> 01:05:31.036
That is the bush king.
He doesn't exist.


380
01:05:31.138 --> 01:05:33.934
That is, he only exists
in the king's imagination.


381
01:05:34.039 --> 01:05:36.197
But the two kings rule together.

382
01:05:39.339 --> 01:05:41.031
The leopard speaks!

383
01:05:41.772 --> 01:05:45.796
For the annual ceremony
all dogs must be slaughtered-


384
01:05:46.105 --> 01:05:48.934
the preceding night
at the Gate of Tears.


385
01:05:49.038 --> 01:05:53.562
The dogs assemble in the streets,
and try to talk like humans.


386
01:05:53.672 --> 01:05:58.536
But if they succeed, it will
bring a plague upon the people.


387
01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:18.593
We must conquer the Egbas!

388
01:06:25.537 --> 01:06:28.002
We shall break Abeokuta!

389
01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:35.227
My house needs thatching!

390
01:06:40.169 --> 01:06:43.862
I'll thatch my roof with
the skulls of my enemies.


391
01:07:05.302 --> 01:07:10.064
How are my brethren?
Answer, white man before I kill you!


392
01:07:13.334 --> 01:07:17.665
How is the health
of the King of Prussia?


393
01:07:21.134 --> 01:07:27.260
How is my brother,
the Tsar of Russia?


394
01:07:29.801 --> 01:07:36.029
And how is Queen Victoria,
whose heart is a big calabash...


395
01:07:36.134 --> 01:07:40.122
overflowing with palm wine
for the thirsty man?


396
01:07:42.467 --> 01:07:45.398
I can't hear what you said...

397
01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.694
I can't hear you.

398
01:08:06.133 --> 01:08:11.326
Prepare for your death, stranger.
Time doesn't occur to the king.


399
01:08:39.398 --> 01:08:43.830
The Devil is white. Death is white!
All whites are half dead.


400
01:09:05.431 --> 01:09:09.556
That's what they always do before
they behead a white man.


401
01:09:15.296 --> 01:09:17.922
They have painted your face black...

402
01:09:18.763 --> 01:09:21.990
because they are not
allowed to kill a white man.


403
01:09:23.529 --> 01:09:25.621
I'm not afraid of you.

404
01:09:30.062 --> 01:09:34.085
In this place, the dead are
more alive than the living.


405
01:09:39.596 --> 01:09:43.585
No one may see the leopard
while he drinks.


406
01:09:54.861 --> 01:10:01.055
Hey, white man. One day
I will drink from your skull!


407
01:10:03.362 --> 01:10:07.054
This was the King of the Mahis.

408
01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:32.954
The dead eat so...
The dead drink so.


409
01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:49.887
I have sworn, in my swearing house...
to conquer the Egbas.


410
01:10:51.026 --> 01:10:55.391
I fear nobody.
I have only one fear.


411
01:10:55.725 --> 01:10:58.248
And that is that one day...

412
01:10:58.692 --> 01:11:03.091
there may be anyone left
to be conquered.


413
01:11:04.792 --> 01:11:09.248
But tell me, white man...
why have the Portuguese...


414
01:11:09.892 --> 01:11:15.325
brought three hundred and thirty-five
thousand warships to my shore?


415
01:11:18.292 --> 01:11:21.780
And why did you
poison my greyhound?


416
01:12:34.688 --> 01:12:37.710
The snow... the... snow.

417
01:13:22.153 --> 01:13:24.517
Quickly! Quickly! 
Kill the guards!

418
01:13:30.452 --> 01:13:32.849
I am Bakoko,
the confidant of the prince.


419
01:13:32.985 --> 01:13:35.178
Prince Kankpe is waiting for you.
Quickly, stranger, come with me!


420
01:13:35.286 --> 01:13:38.048
Where is Taparica!
You must take Taparica along!


421
01:13:52.718 --> 01:13:55.048
Why did you free us?

422
01:13:55.786 --> 01:14:00.808
Prince Kankpe has decided to
revolt against his uncle Ahadee.


423
01:14:00.985 --> 01:14:03.246
He is the rightful heir to the throne.

424
01:14:04.584 --> 01:14:08.483
Yesterday, King Bossa Ahadee
went up north with his entire army.


425
01:14:09.118 --> 01:14:11.743
Out there live many hills.

426
01:14:16.884 --> 01:14:22.510
We must overcome Bossa Ahadee.
But we'll need your help to do it.


427
01:14:23.185 --> 01:14:25.276
Our rebel warriors
have all disappointed us.


428
01:14:25.384 --> 01:14:27.976
The women are much more brave.

429
01:14:34.883 --> 01:14:36.576
My father.

430
01:14:38.449 --> 01:14:40.938
The traitor must die.

431
01:14:41.050 --> 01:14:44.504
He has opened up the
graves of our ancestors!


432
01:15:07.916 --> 01:15:10.574
We will go down to
the fortress on the coast...


433
01:15:10.681 --> 01:15:13.546
and there we will establish
an army of Amazons.


434
01:15:16.016 --> 01:15:19.709
The prince would like to make a
pact of blood brotherhood with you.


435
01:15:20.382 --> 01:15:23.870
Blood brothers do not kill each other.

436
01:15:26.415 --> 01:15:29.437
If the new king will turn over
the slave trade to me...


437
01:15:29.548 --> 01:15:31.071
...then I am his man.

438
01:15:33.549 --> 01:15:36.708
Does he have the vaguest notion
what we're talking about?


439
01:15:38.781 --> 01:15:42.269
He is in agreement.
He has no choice.


440
01:15:45.214 --> 01:15:48.805
He says yes to anything.
You see, he is quite insane.


441
01:16:13.913 --> 01:16:19.039
All right! Over there!
What a wretched mess.


442
01:16:19.445 --> 01:16:22.536
Listen to me! I said over there!
All of you!


443
01:16:29.345 --> 01:16:32.107
You'll have to get up quicker,
if you don't want to get killed.


444
01:16:46.478 --> 01:16:48.443
I've got four hundred new recruits.
Where do you want them?


445
01:16:48.544 --> 01:16:50.011
Not over here.
Take them down to the shore.


446
01:16:50.112 --> 01:16:51.839
They all want to fight!
They want to kill all the men.


447
01:16:51.945 --> 01:16:52.933
Don't bother me now.

448
01:16:53.078 --> 01:16:56.066
I've got to get this herd
of women organized first.


449
01:17:02.577 --> 01:17:05.436
- Shields up!
- Watch what you do with that spear!


450
01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:15.603
All right! Now, fight!

451
01:17:20.442 --> 01:17:21.908
No, you've got it all wrong!

452
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:24.568
You've got to hold
your spear like this...


453
01:17:24.677 --> 01:17:27.074
and keep your feet moving.
Like this!


454
01:17:33.442 --> 01:17:36.500
Here, you take it.

455
01:17:38.276 --> 01:17:39.867
Attack, damn you!

456
01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:50.441
Let's have that cutlass!
Come on, attack! Attack!


457
01:17:50.575 --> 01:17:53.007
Keep your spear up!
Defend yourself.


458
01:17:53.109 --> 01:17:55.099
Cover your body with the shield!

459
01:17:55.209 --> 01:18:01.574
If you trip and fall,
it's the end of you! Haaa! Haaa!


460
01:18:07.942 --> 01:18:10.339
Come on! Get a move on!

461
01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:04.102
One! Two!

462
01:19:05.606 --> 01:19:08.629
Three! Four!

463
01:19:09.772 --> 01:19:11.670
Five! And take the enemy!

464
01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:18.200
Not bad... All right, now get
back in your starting positions.


465
01:19:18.305 --> 01:19:22.499
Come on, quicker, keep moving!

466
01:19:24.639 --> 01:19:27.934
And now... ready!?

467
01:19:28.271 --> 01:19:31.169
Attack position.
No, no, no, no!... At ease!


468
01:19:31.872 --> 01:19:35.598
The whole thing again faster!
In position!


469
01:19:37.237 --> 01:19:42.693
One! Two! Three!

470
01:19:43.704 --> 01:19:48.329
Who told them they could take a rest?

471
01:20:27.336 --> 01:20:29.631
Who told them they could take a rest?

472
01:20:29.736 --> 01:20:31.634
On your feet now, come on.

473
01:20:31.769 --> 01:20:34.530
- Keep on moving!
- Come on, come on!


474
01:20:34.636 --> 01:20:35.623
Get up!

475
01:20:35.735 --> 01:20:38.827
We don't want to practice anymore.
We want to fight!


476
01:20:38.936 --> 01:20:43.425
I swear I will bring back Bossa
Ahadee's head- single-handed!


477
01:20:43.602 --> 01:20:45.329
No, you're not yet ready.

478
01:20:45.469 --> 01:20:51.231
You've got to keep on practicing.
You've got to obey my orders.


479
01:20:51.335 --> 01:20:54.926
Come on. I don't want to hear
any more from you.


480
01:20:55.034 --> 01:20:58.263
I want you to hear what
I have to say. I command here.


481
01:20:58.369 --> 01:21:02.323
No one else! And we're going
to continue practicing.


482
01:21:02.434 --> 01:21:05.797
No more arguments from you.
Only that way can we succeed.


483
01:21:06.901 --> 01:21:09.163
We will storm the palace
soon enough.


484
01:21:18.233 --> 01:21:20.825
I've made my decision! We attack!

485
01:21:23.635 --> 01:21:28.397
We march out tomorrow.
Fight, fight, fight, fight...


486
01:21:31.634 --> 01:21:34.794
Fight, fight, fight, fight...

487
01:22:17.732 --> 01:22:20.459
Off to Abomey!

488
01:24:30.993 --> 01:24:33.753
They have taken the
sacred python from the temple.


489
01:24:33.858 --> 01:24:36.451
We must turn back-
nobody gets past it alive!


490
01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:39.117
In my country, 
I was a snake myself!

491
01:24:39.226 --> 01:24:41.987
Out of the way! Attack! Attack!

492
01:25:32.524 --> 01:25:35.149
The dead kings have deposed you.

493
01:25:37.056 --> 01:25:39.545
So, now I will go and sleep.

494
01:25:43.190 --> 01:25:46.589
Wall up the doors
to the women's quarters.


495
01:26:02.422 --> 01:26:06.877
No! Don't let him get away!
Stop him! Hold Him!


496
01:26:06.989 --> 01:26:10.615
Stay back. His wives will
strangle him now.


497
01:26:28.121 --> 01:26:30.950
The new king takes his seat!

498
01:26:33.788 --> 01:26:35.720
Shall I ask him to approach?

499
01:27:06.154 --> 01:27:09.017
He has given you
the name Adjinakou-


500
01:27:09.119 --> 01:27:11.211
that means ''green snake''.

501
01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:14.807
He has appointed you
Viceroy of Dahomey.


502
01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:19.975
Our King Kankpe gives you Fort
Elmina as your official residence.


503
01:27:59.352 --> 01:28:02.908
We have to remove the glass
windows from the main house.


504
01:28:03.017 --> 01:28:05.210
The servants sprinkled
them with water...


505
01:28:05.317 --> 01:28:08.147
because they believed the
rising sun set them on fire.


506
01:28:08.251 --> 01:28:09.342
You'd do better to see to it...

507
01:28:09.451 --> 01:28:11.712
the ventilation in the slave
quarters is improved.


508
01:28:11.817 --> 01:28:14.476
- Too many are dying.
- Yes, Adjinakou.


509
01:28:17.451 --> 01:28:19.440
We'll have to get them shipped faster.

510
01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:22.517
The captain of the Flor de Bahia
has the best quarters in town-


511
01:28:22.617 --> 01:28:24.810
I gave him the east wing.

512
01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:26.878
And the relays are all prepared.

513
01:28:26.983 --> 01:28:29.212
Tomorrow they will all be in position.

514
01:28:29.317 --> 01:28:32.078
The distance is twenty-three
thousand five hundred bamboo poles.


515
01:28:32.184 --> 01:28:34.671
That will be a great
surprise for our king.


516
01:28:48.483 --> 01:28:52.573
They're offering you a place in
the syndicate back in Bahia.


517
01:28:53.483 --> 01:28:55.607
I don't need that crap!

518
01:28:56.316 --> 01:28:58.906
And why haven't I received
the ships that I asked for?


519
01:28:59.015 --> 01:29:00.914
I don't know, Don Francisco.

520
01:29:02.482 --> 01:29:04.640
But I will bring it to
the governor's attention...


521
01:29:04.748 --> 01:29:07.214
- as soon as I return.
- This is an outrage!


522
01:29:23.847 --> 01:29:27.574
This is the second shipment of slaves
you've received without payment.


523
01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:30.646
I'm not sure I can trust your word.

524
01:30:03.347 --> 01:30:05.778
Sometimes I get a bit tired.

525
01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:11.436
Tonight I won't take any of them.

526
01:30:12.312 --> 01:30:14.539
Which one would you like to have?

527
01:30:19.179 --> 01:30:20.167
That one.

528
01:30:21.112 --> 01:30:22.906
You there- come on up!

529
01:30:27.312 --> 01:30:28.640
Yes, you!

530
01:30:30.945 --> 01:30:33.309
If they get pregnant,
they aren't taken aboard.


531
01:30:33.411 --> 01:30:35.569
Then they get their own hut out here.

532
01:30:36.078 --> 01:30:38.704
We've already got
a whole village full of them.


533
01:30:38.812 --> 01:30:43.834
- Who are these women?
- Our future murderers.


534
01:31:11.643 --> 01:31:14.370
Send the signals!
I want to write a letter for you...


535
01:31:14.476 --> 01:31:16.170
to take back to my partners in Brazil.

536
01:31:16.277 --> 01:31:18.071
It's going to take about
an hour and a half...


537
01:31:18.176 --> 01:31:20.736
before I get an
answering signal anyway.


538
01:32:22.141 --> 01:32:27.039
I cannot begin to describe this
cretinous existence of mine.


539
01:32:27.241 --> 01:32:32.365
Nor how lonely it is to be
without family or friends.


540
01:32:32.873 --> 01:32:35.305
The only white man in this country...

541
01:32:35.406 --> 01:32:37.428
perhaps on this whole continent.

542
01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:42.497
Meanwhile I have become the
father of sixty-two children...


543
01:32:42.607 --> 01:32:45.004
but this gives me no satisfaction.

544
01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:48.900
Perhaps next year
I shall come back and marry.


545
01:32:50.305 --> 01:32:53.238
I would live in the lands
of ice and snow...


546
01:32:53.339 --> 01:32:55.998
anywhere to be away from here...

547
01:33:00.372 --> 01:33:03.963
The heat here is
mean and inescapable.


548
01:33:04.805 --> 01:33:08.067
It courses through the
bodies of the people like a fever-


549
01:33:08.705 --> 01:33:12.604
and yet my heart grows
colder and colder.


550
01:33:42.504 --> 01:33:47.028
Adjinakou... there's
an answer coming back.


551
01:34:22.201 --> 01:34:26.101
The king sends his brother the
Royal Leopard Salute.


552
01:34:36.268 --> 01:34:40.222
This one's about nineteen-
looks strong and healthy.


553
01:34:45.768 --> 01:34:49.223
He must be about twenty-five-
a good, hard boy.


554
01:34:49.335 --> 01:34:54.232
This one's about the same age.
And he's a very strong boy also.


555
01:37:17.729 --> 01:37:21.216
- You obviously like my nuns' choir.
- Nun's choir. Not bad.


556
01:37:21.328 --> 01:37:23.921
Do you know Pedro Vincente,
the captain of the Flor de Bahia?


557
01:37:24.028 --> 01:37:25.584
Yes, I do.

558
01:37:26.061 --> 01:37:28.619
How much would some
interesting news be worth to you?


559
01:37:28.728 --> 01:37:30.058
I won't cheat you.

560
01:37:32.994 --> 01:37:36.222
Pedro Vincente took a large
consignment of slaves off your hands.


561
01:37:36.328 --> 01:37:37.794
He never paid.

562
01:37:39.228 --> 01:37:42.058
Then let me tell you what
I saw with my own eyes.


563
01:37:42.161 --> 01:37:44.718
The Flor de Bahia was
brimming over with cargo.


564
01:37:44.827 --> 01:37:47.452
He cheated you.

565
01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:52.053
He's gone and dumped all his
weapons and goods to the British-


566
01:37:52.193 --> 01:37:54.216
made a double profit on the deal.

567
01:37:54.327 --> 01:37:56.816
And guess what happened
to the Flor de Bahia!


568
01:37:56.927 --> 01:38:00.620
She's drifting off shore
near Lagos... unseaworthy.


569
01:38:00.727 --> 01:38:02.852
And on top of that,
the crew has mutinied...


570
01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.051
which means now
you've got him trapped.


571
01:38:09.861 --> 01:38:14.451
You take a cutter and deliver
a message to Captain Vincente.


572
01:38:14.559 --> 01:38:18.457
''Come here. I'll re-equip you.
Nobody cheats me twice.''


573
01:38:45.091 --> 01:38:47.614
Come on, move on...
and take everything.


574
01:38:49.759 --> 01:38:53.121
Hey! What is the meaning of this?

575
01:38:53.524 --> 01:38:59.013
Our King Kankpe was never insane.
He only pretended to be.


576
01:38:59.724 --> 01:39:03.053
He thanks his brother,
who was once the viceroy.


577
01:39:03.324 --> 01:39:05.722
The blood brother of the king
was a big tree...


578
01:39:05.824 --> 01:39:07.347
... and that's what he
wants you to know.


579
01:39:07.458 --> 01:39:10.082
Why does the king speak
of me only in the past tense?


580
01:39:10.190 --> 01:39:11.781
Adjinakou, things look very bad...

581
01:39:11.890 --> 01:39:14.084
but as long as Kankpe is king
you're fairly safe.


582
01:39:14.191 --> 01:39:16.315
He would never kill a blood brother.

583
01:39:17.524 --> 01:39:19.046
There are still some rifles in there.

584
01:39:19.157 --> 01:39:22.054
Where's his money?
Come on, hurry up!


585
01:40:03.855 --> 01:40:07.981
- Do you really want to help me?
- I keep my word.


586
01:40:08.088 --> 01:40:09.951
But that won't help me anymore...

587
01:40:10.055 --> 01:40:11.918
and it won't help you either!

588
01:40:12.489 --> 01:40:14.421
Brazil's joined the rest of the world...

589
01:40:14.522 --> 01:40:16.078
and abolished the slave trade.

590
01:40:16.188 --> 01:40:17.983
Any shipments currently under way...

591
01:40:18.088 --> 01:40:20.111
will be seized on the high seas.

592
01:40:21.088 --> 01:40:22.985
In the eyes of the law...

593
01:40:23.087 --> 01:40:27.951
Fort Elmina and our lives
have ceased to exist.


594
01:40:28.187 --> 01:40:30.550
And while I'm at it,
there's something else.


595
01:40:30.653 --> 01:40:33.415
I know that for at least one year...

596
01:40:33.521 --> 01:40:37.351
you've been slandered and cheated
by your partners in Bahia.


597
01:40:37.488 --> 01:40:40.682
Your assets have all been
confiscated by the state bank.


598
01:40:40.787 --> 01:40:44.652
And in addition, the English
have put a price on your head.


599
01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:49.682
Finally something's happened.

600
01:40:54.253 --> 01:40:57.946
Finally something's happened.

601
01:41:03.986 --> 01:41:05.508
To slavery...

602
01:41:05.818 --> 01:41:10.013
the greatest misunderstanding
in the history of mankind!


603
01:41:12.586 --> 01:41:18.348
It was no misunderstanding.
It was a crime.


604
01:41:25.652 --> 01:41:33.209
Slavery is an element of the
human heart... To our ruin!


605
01:47:40.204 --> 01:47:48.828
The slaves will sell their masters
and grow wings.
