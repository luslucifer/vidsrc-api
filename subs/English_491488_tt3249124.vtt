00:01:13.236 --> 00:01:14.304
Oh shit.

2
00:01:14.337 --> 00:01:15.605
Oh shit.

3
00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:28.912
My phone.

4
00:02:28.945 --> 00:02:29.779
My phone.

5
00:02:29.812 --> 00:02:30.647
My phone.

6
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.015
My phone.

7
00:02:32.048 --> 00:02:33.816
Okay my battery.

8
00:02:35.318 --> 00:02:36.719
Work.

9
00:02:37.787 --> 00:02:39.389
Shit.

10
00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:31.407
Let go of me.

11
00:03:31.441 --> 00:03:32.709
Help!

12
00:03:32.742 --> 00:03:34.644
Somebody help me!

13
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.623
Oh my god.

14
00:03:58.868 --> 00:04:00.837
Oh my god.

15
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.405
Oh my...

16
00:05:40.903 --> 00:05:42.672
Ooo.

17
00:06:02.191 --> 00:06:05.094
You need more coffee for your
sweetener hun?


18
00:06:06.095 --> 00:06:08.898
You ain't got anymore of that
hot chili do you sweetheart?


19
00:06:11.234 --> 00:06:14.637
Still waiting on the meat delivery.

20
00:06:14.937 --> 00:06:17.006
Hope you're not expecting a tip.

21
00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.709
Mel when have you ever left
me a tip?


22
00:06:19.742 --> 00:06:21.010
Hey.

23
00:06:21.644 --> 00:06:22.678
Huh?

24
00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:24.080
Forget it.

25
00:06:31.053 --> 00:06:32.622
Oh perfect.

26
00:06:32.955 --> 00:06:34.824
Hello?

27
00:06:35.191 --> 00:06:37.160
No she's leaving today.

28
00:06:37.693 --> 00:06:39.162
On foot.

29
00:06:39.195 --> 00:06:40.963
Got her guitar and all.

30
00:06:40.997 --> 00:06:42.765
It's too far.

31
00:06:45.168 --> 00:06:46.969
Go the way you always go.

32
00:06:47.003 --> 00:06:48.905
Or just wait in the parking lot,
gotta go.


33
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:55.077
Oh well that don't sound very interesting.

34
00:06:55.711 --> 00:06:57.480
Every dull moment hun.

35
00:07:02.185 --> 00:07:04.754
Oh hey Meg can you make this
one to go please?


36
00:07:04.787 --> 00:07:06.622
That time already?

37
00:07:06.956 --> 00:07:08.624
Looks like.

38
00:07:09.192 --> 00:07:10.726
Looks like.

39
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.929
Hey.

40
00:07:13.596 --> 00:07:15.198
Something to remember me by.

41
00:07:16.632 --> 00:07:18.000
But you didn't even finish
your meal.


42
00:07:18.835 --> 00:07:20.703
Such a waste too.

43
00:07:22.972 --> 00:07:26.008
You know I'm thinking it might
rain tonight.


44
00:07:27.143 --> 00:07:29.078
You sure you wanna hit the
road like this,


45
00:07:29.111 --> 00:07:32.815
I mean I can see if my friend
can give you a ride.


46
00:07:34.083 --> 00:07:35.918
It never rains in LA.

47
00:07:35.952 --> 00:07:38.588
Besides I'll probably reach
the desert before nightfall


48
00:07:38.621 --> 00:07:41.057
anyways so I really don't
think it's gonna be a problem.


49
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.326
Well maybe you should go to
the ladies room,


50
00:07:43.359 --> 00:07:44.994
just one last time.

51
00:07:45.228 --> 00:07:47.063
To be sure.

52
00:07:47.096 --> 00:07:50.132
It's not a lot clean places
to tinkle off the interstate.


53
00:07:50.166 --> 00:07:52.134
You know I just went.

54
00:07:52.168 --> 00:07:54.036
Tinkle.

55
00:07:54.237 --> 00:07:55.338
Well.

56
00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:57.106
I do have some fresh TP in
the back.


57
00:07:57.139 --> 00:07:59.275
I'm just gonna put some in
your pack you know.


58
00:08:01.244 --> 00:08:03.946
So did you learn how to play
this thing?


59
00:08:04.981 --> 00:08:06.115
Nope.

60
00:08:06.148 --> 00:08:08.751
But Benjamin gave it to me so
I'm taking it with me.


61
00:08:09.886 --> 00:08:11.254
Who knows I might have to
sell or something


62
00:08:11.287 --> 00:08:12.788
if things get tight.

63
00:08:12.822 --> 00:08:14.957
Oh you need some money?

64
00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:17.026
I've got my bag in the back office.

65
00:08:17.059 --> 00:08:18.127
I'm fine.

66
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.362
I assure you, really I am.

67
00:08:19.395 --> 00:08:21.264
I'm just thinking ahead.

68
00:08:22.098 --> 00:08:23.833
Far, far ahead.

69
00:08:23.866 --> 00:08:25.835
Besides if I didn't know any better,

70
00:08:25.868 --> 00:08:28.604
which I do I would think you
were trying to stop me


71
00:08:28.638 --> 00:08:30.106
from going.

72
00:08:33.042 --> 00:08:34.777
Hello?

73
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:36.178
Hi daddy.

74
00:08:38.114 --> 00:08:40.149
Yeah I should be back there
by next weekend


75
00:08:40.182 --> 00:08:41.751
at the very latest.

76
00:08:43.119 --> 00:08:45.821
Yes I'm being safe, I'm riding...

77
00:08:45.855 --> 00:08:47.957
Yeah I'm riding with friends.

78
00:08:48.724 --> 00:08:50.660
Okay well I'll call you and
check up with you every chance


79
00:08:50.693 --> 00:08:52.261
I get okay?

80
00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:54.997
I love you too daddy.

81
00:08:55.031 --> 00:08:56.098
Bye.

82
00:08:57.366 --> 00:08:59.035
Daddy doesn't know I'm hitchhiking.

83
00:08:59.068 --> 00:09:00.736
He wouldn't approve.

84
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.306
I can't say I'm so keen on
the idea either.


85
00:09:03.339 --> 00:09:07.009
Every horror movie,
well everyone worth it's self.


86
00:09:10.146 --> 00:09:12.148
He's out with some pretty
young thang.


87
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:14.216
Hitchhiking it alone across
the countryside.


88
00:09:17.987 --> 00:09:21.324
Well lucky for me I can
defend myself.


89
00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:25.161
Mhm, well why isn't Ben
driving you to your dads house?


90
00:09:26.796 --> 00:09:28.664
Things with Ben ended two
weeks ago.


91
00:09:28.698 --> 00:09:30.666
I know I told you that.

92
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.868
When you missed your period,

93
00:09:32.902 --> 00:09:35.905
was that the straw that broke
his camels back?


94
00:09:36.238 --> 00:09:39.175
I went out and I bought one
of those blue pregnancy


95
00:09:39.208 --> 00:09:41.110
test strips, just to be sure.

96
00:09:42.178 --> 00:09:44.146
And he came home and he saw
the box on the counter


97
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.681
and he bolted.

98
00:09:46.115 --> 00:09:48.150
He didn't even say goodbye.

99
00:09:48.417 --> 00:09:51.153
I assume the test was a negative.

100
00:09:51.187 --> 00:09:52.955
Like you'd really let me take
the bootheel express


101
00:09:52.989 --> 00:09:54.290
halfway across the country if
you thought I was


102
00:09:54.323 --> 00:09:56.225
with a child.

103
00:09:56.792 --> 00:09:59.362
I'd be fine with it either
way hun, really I would.


104
00:10:00.096 --> 00:10:02.231
Babies are so precious.

105
00:10:02.465 --> 00:10:04.433
Worth their weight in gold.

106
00:10:24.954 --> 00:10:29.959

124
00:12:19.368 --> 00:12:21.270
You need a ride toots?

125
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.339
Maybe.

126
00:12:23.372 --> 00:12:25.307
How far are you going?

127
00:12:25.341 --> 00:12:27.376
All the way to your toes.

128
00:12:27.409 --> 00:12:28.577
If you let me.

129
00:12:28.611 --> 00:12:30.880
Are you saying you can afford it?

130
00:12:30.913 --> 00:12:32.381
I don't know you tell me.

131
00:12:32.414 --> 00:12:34.216
You're the one that's asking
for a ride.


132
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.052
I've never gone all the way before.

133
00:12:37.987 --> 00:12:40.322
Maybe I'll suck you for a
ride to Vegas.


134
00:12:41.357 --> 00:12:44.059
Oh but what if
I want to go further?

135
00:12:45.361 --> 00:12:46.328
Oh.

136
00:12:46.362 --> 00:12:47.062
Sorry.

137
00:12:47.096 --> 00:12:47.997
Oh it's okay.

138
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.398
You're too beautiful to wait.

139
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.484
Ciao

140
00:13:08.517 --> 00:13:09.585
Thanks babe you always tell..

141
00:13:09.618 --> 00:13:12.021
Ah please, please, please stop.

142
00:13:12.288 --> 00:13:13.389
Fine.

143
00:13:13.422 --> 00:13:14.423
Please stop,
let's just start from the beginning.


144
00:13:14.456 --> 00:13:15.958
She messed it up.

145
00:13:15.991 --> 00:13:18.160
Gosh can't you just be simpler.

146
00:13:19.195 --> 00:13:21.030
Can we just get the hotel room?

147
00:13:21.664 --> 00:13:23.332
Just a hotel room.

148
00:13:41.317 --> 00:13:43.319
Now listen to me carefully Woody.

149
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.023
Your ex wife gets the hundred
thousand dollars.


150
00:13:48.057 --> 00:13:49.325
Don't do it.

151
00:13:54.663 --> 00:13:56.232
You talking to me or you're talking

152
00:13:56.265 --> 00:13:57.399
to somebody else?

153
00:13:57.433 --> 00:14:00.302
Eh just some poor schmuck
stuck on the side of the road


154
00:14:00.336 --> 00:14:03.038
about ready to make the
biggest mistake of his life.


155
00:14:03.239 --> 00:14:04.440
Don't do it.

156
00:14:04.473 --> 00:14:06.442
Good for him.

157
00:14:06.475 --> 00:14:09.044
Basically you have no more
appeals left.


158
00:14:09.078 --> 00:14:10.246
Yeah.

159
00:14:10.279 --> 00:14:11.413
You have 10 days to sign..

160
00:14:11.447 --> 00:14:12.615
Yeah I know, I know, 
I know already.

161
00:14:12.648 --> 00:14:14.383
Thank you for nothing.

162
00:14:14.416 --> 00:14:15.551
I understand.

163
00:14:15.584 --> 00:14:18.621
I'm 45 years old and I'm flat broke.

164
00:14:18.654 --> 00:14:20.456
She gets the recording studio,

165
00:14:20.489 --> 00:14:21.357
she gets the house..

166
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.092
Your ex-wife is also getting

167
00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:25.394
the hundred thousand dollars
from your IRA.


168
00:14:28.197 --> 00:14:29.498
You want it all?

169
00:14:29.531 --> 00:14:32.034
You want it all you bloody
sucking leech.


170
00:14:32.701 --> 00:14:34.737
Alright I'll give it all.

171
00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.005
You want it all?

172
00:14:36.038 --> 00:14:38.407
Here you go take it all.

173
00:14:38.707 --> 00:14:41.510
Here you go, suck on that you leech.

174
00:14:45.481 --> 00:14:47.383
Okay.

175
00:14:53.722 --> 00:14:55.424
Megan.

176
00:14:55.457 --> 00:14:57.359
What the hell,
okay my car broke down,


177
00:14:57.393 --> 00:14:59.228
I'm in the middle of nowhere
and I'm totally gonna miss


178
00:14:59.261 --> 00:15:00.162
the game.

179
00:15:00.195 --> 00:15:01.697
So call me back.

180
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.565
Okay, thank you.

181
00:15:10.039 --> 00:15:11.674
Oh my god.

182
00:15:49.611 --> 00:15:52.214
Unlimited minutes my perfect ass.

183
00:16:29.184 --> 00:16:30.819
Hey.

184
00:16:30.853 --> 00:16:33.055
Do you know anything about cars?

185
00:16:35.624 --> 00:16:38.193
Hell of a bad place to break down.

186
00:16:39.795 --> 00:16:41.764
Sucks huh?

187
00:16:46.135 --> 00:16:48.771
Could I possibly trouble you
for a ride into town?


188
00:16:52.674 --> 00:16:53.842
Okay.

189
00:17:39.421 --> 00:17:41.557
So your cars kind of a fixer upper.

190
00:17:42.558 --> 00:17:44.626
I just picked it up today.

191
00:17:47.863 --> 00:17:50.799
So is there any chance might
you might stop


192
00:17:50.833 --> 00:17:52.601
at the liquor store?

193
00:18:07.483 --> 00:18:09.485
Hey you missed it.

194
00:18:09.852 --> 00:18:11.520
Hey.

195
00:19:27.896 --> 00:19:29.698
You're no good to me never mind.

196
00:19:35.771 --> 00:19:37.339
You're diseased.

197
00:22:02.651 --> 00:22:04.753
Oh shoulda brought pie.

198
00:22:12.561 --> 00:22:15.897
Hello somebody there?

199
00:22:22.104 --> 00:22:24.039
Hello?

200
00:22:57.539 --> 00:22:59.641
I need this last.

201
00:23:06.581 --> 00:23:08.283
Hello?

202
00:23:12.154 --> 00:23:13.989
Hello?

203
00:23:27.903 --> 00:23:29.704
Hey.

204
00:23:30.005 --> 00:23:31.673
Hi.

205
00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.542
Come here.

206
00:23:33.742 --> 00:23:34.176
Look baby.

207
00:23:35.577 --> 00:23:36.912
Hi.

208
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.215
Hey.

209
00:23:40.248 --> 00:23:41.883
Have you come to sing for
your supper?


210
00:23:44.085 --> 00:23:45.954
Oh look at this collar.

211
00:23:47.155 --> 00:23:49.157
Oh do you belong to somebody?

212
00:23:50.759 --> 00:23:52.160
Do you want one?

213
00:23:52.727 --> 00:23:54.229
Okay but we gotta make 'em
last alright,


214
00:23:54.262 --> 00:23:55.897
it's all I got.

215
00:24:00.068 --> 00:24:01.603
Okay.

216
00:24:01.636 --> 00:24:02.838
If you come back for more you
have to keep


217
00:24:02.871 --> 00:24:04.573
the werewolves away.

218
00:24:05.874 --> 00:24:07.142
I'm serious.

219
00:24:19.588 --> 00:24:22.991
Oh baby I thought you were
sexy with your clothes on.


220
00:24:23.825 --> 00:24:24.926
Why?

221
00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.695
I thought you knew better.

222
00:24:26.728 --> 00:24:27.662
Mm I thought I did.

223
00:24:27.696 --> 00:24:29.097
Did you bring them?

224
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.633
Baby did I not only bring 'em,

225
00:24:31.666 --> 00:24:34.970
but I believe you said ribbed
but not lubed.


226
00:24:36.071 --> 00:24:38.573
What are we gonna do with all these?

227
00:24:38.607 --> 00:24:40.175
We're here just for tonight.

228
00:24:41.209 --> 00:24:44.646
Then again my gentlemen
always comes prepared.


229
00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.181
Comes!

230
00:26:19.374 --> 00:26:20.909
Did you see that?

231
00:26:20.942 --> 00:26:22.677
Yeah.

232
00:26:22.711 --> 00:26:24.179
It's probably that damn sheriff.

233
00:26:24.212 --> 00:26:26.247
Go see, get over there.

234
00:26:26.281 --> 00:26:27.315
Okay.

235
00:26:27.349 --> 00:26:28.149
I will.

236
00:26:28.183 --> 00:26:29.951
Just stay here.

237
00:26:32.754 --> 00:26:34.222
Hey sheriff.

238
00:26:35.156 --> 00:26:36.424
Is that you?

239
00:26:38.059 --> 00:26:39.794
Sheriff?

240
00:27:09.157 --> 00:27:11.893
See anything you like sheriff?

241
00:27:41.556 --> 00:27:43.058
Good morning Janalee

242
00:27:43.091 --> 00:27:44.325
Good morning sheriff.

243
00:27:45.193 --> 00:27:47.162
Sheriff's office,
how may we serve you?


244
00:27:48.163 --> 00:27:50.999
No ma'am we are just a field office.

245
00:27:51.399 --> 00:27:53.768
Yes you are a first to call
it in.


246
00:27:55.003 --> 00:27:55.970
Buffy Pratt.

247
00:27:56.004 --> 00:27:56.905
Is this new?

248
00:27:56.938 --> 00:27:58.440
Yes just hit the fax machine.

249
00:27:58.973 --> 00:28:00.842
I'll let the sheriff know.

250
00:28:01.142 --> 00:28:02.844
Thank you.

251
00:28:04.212 --> 00:28:06.081
She was reported missing by
her uncle.


252
00:28:06.114 --> 00:28:07.816
He thinks she was hitchhiking.

253
00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:09.851
Oh no.

254
00:28:09.884 --> 00:28:11.286
Oh and that was Ms. Tracy on
the phone,


255
00:28:11.319 --> 00:28:14.322
she says there's a fire near
the (mumbles) road.


256
00:28:14.355 --> 00:28:16.958
Well get the volunteers on
that fire.


257
00:28:16.991 --> 00:28:18.960
I've got bigger fish to fry here.

258
00:28:25.266 --> 00:28:27.368
I do not like the look of this.

259
00:29:11.279 --> 00:29:13.348
Oh I knew I should have
camped further away


260
00:29:13.381 --> 00:29:14.816
from the highway.

261
00:29:24.259 --> 00:29:25.426
Hey kid,

262
00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.328
you're car break down or something?

263
00:29:27.362 --> 00:29:29.531
Too much to ask for coffee I assume.

264
00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.203
70 plus miles to the next gas station.

265
00:29:35.637 --> 00:29:37.472
And farm is back that way,

266
00:29:37.505 --> 00:29:39.240
quite a bit.

267
00:29:40.575 --> 00:29:42.577
I'll be happy to give you a lift.

268
00:29:43.244 --> 00:29:44.579
I'm 22.

269
00:29:45.346 --> 00:29:47.348
I'm sorry did I miss something?

270
00:29:47.382 --> 00:29:49.350
I'm not a kid, I'm 22.

271
00:29:50.318 --> 00:29:52.086
Are you part of a search team
or something


272
00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.354
because I don't want to hold
you up.


273
00:29:53.388 --> 00:29:55.290
Oh I'm just putting up some flyers.

274
00:29:55.323 --> 00:29:57.058
Trying to do my part, you know.

275
00:29:57.091 --> 00:29:59.260
Well I hope they find whoever
they're looking for.


276
00:30:00.461 --> 00:30:02.363
I have some baby wipes,
you want to clean up


277
00:30:02.397 --> 00:30:03.531
before you hit the road.

278
00:30:03.565 --> 00:30:05.300
Five dollar cashy money.

279
00:30:05.333 --> 00:30:07.101
I ain't really got much money man.

280
00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:11.239
Oh how cute.

281
00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.481
What's her name?

282
00:30:20.515 --> 00:30:22.183
Princess.

283
00:30:33.394 --> 00:30:35.597
Oh yes.

284
00:30:38.066 --> 00:30:39.601
I know you're thirsty.

285
00:30:40.168 --> 00:30:41.903
You are correct.

286
00:30:58.386 --> 00:31:01.256
Sorry I put on such a hard
candy shell on earlier.


287
00:31:01.289 --> 00:31:03.725
I mean you never can be too cautious.

288
00:31:03.758 --> 00:31:06.027
This poor woman.

289
00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.329
Her family must be scared
half to death.


290
00:31:20.408 --> 00:31:22.677
You were in the Marines?

291
00:31:23.745 --> 00:31:25.513
Navy Corpsman.

292
00:31:25.546 --> 00:31:27.415
(Mumbles)

293
00:31:40.028 --> 00:31:42.196
I'm headed to Colorado by way
of Nevada.


294
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:43.398
You?

295
00:31:43.431 --> 00:31:45.366
Reno eventually.

296
00:31:46.501 --> 00:31:49.504
What's in Reno for you?

297
00:31:50.271 --> 00:31:54.042
I'm thinking about paychecks (mumbles)

298
00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:57.779
Do you work in Mexico.

299
00:31:57.812 --> 00:31:59.514
Oh I work all over.

300
00:31:59.547 --> 00:32:01.416
Wherever there's work.

301
00:32:01.449 --> 00:32:03.685
But my check it always comes
to Mexico.


302
00:32:08.556 --> 00:32:11.159
Put one of those fliers up on
this pole for me.


303
00:32:49.497 --> 00:32:50.832
Fasten your seat belt.

304
00:32:50.865 --> 00:32:52.567
Safety first.

305
00:32:59.741 --> 00:33:01.609
Poor. puppy.

306
00:33:01.642 --> 00:33:04.345
Now that is a funny thing
about a puppy.


307
00:33:04.379 --> 00:33:06.581
It takes a village to raise a
little girl,


308
00:33:06.614 --> 00:33:10.118
but it all it takes is an ole
truck and a puppy to get her.


309
00:33:45.553 --> 00:33:47.288
Wakey, wakey.

310
00:33:48.423 --> 00:33:50.658
No eggs, no fucking fakey.

311
00:33:59.534 --> 00:34:01.269
You shoulda drank more of the water

312
00:34:01.302 --> 00:34:03.204
and I wouldn't had to shock you.

313
00:34:05.573 --> 00:34:07.442
Oh my.

314
00:34:07.475 --> 00:34:09.310
Where are my...

315
00:34:10.244 --> 00:34:11.813
Why am I...

316
00:34:14.248 --> 00:34:17.151
Now I know what you're
thinking darling.


317
00:34:17.385 --> 00:34:19.487
This is strictly business.

318
00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.823
And business is booming.

319
00:34:23.858 --> 00:34:25.793
Now Mrs. Smith.

320
00:34:25.827 --> 00:34:27.595
She insists I keep everything
on a strictly


321
00:34:27.628 --> 00:34:29.263
professional level.

322
00:34:30.364 --> 00:34:32.667
Like you're not even a person
or anything.


323
00:34:33.367 --> 00:34:35.269
I am a person.

324
00:34:35.736 --> 00:34:37.805
Why would you do this to me?

325
00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:40.308
Hey.

326
00:34:40.341 --> 00:34:41.476
I'm talking to at you.

327
00:34:41.509 --> 00:34:42.510
Hey!

328
00:34:42.543 --> 00:34:44.412
Is for horses.

329
00:34:46.848 --> 00:34:48.850
Is that smoke?

330
00:34:48.883 --> 00:34:50.651
What is that?

331
00:34:50.685 --> 00:34:52.520
One thing I learned in the core,

332
00:34:52.553 --> 00:34:54.522
nothing stinks like people.

333
00:34:54.822 --> 00:34:56.424
You gotta keep 'em on ice.

334
00:34:56.457 --> 00:34:58.259
Can't let the meat spoil.

335
00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.795
If you're looking for a ransom,

336
00:35:00.828 --> 00:35:03.297
my parents they don't have
much money.


337
00:35:03.331 --> 00:35:04.432
Ransom?

338
00:35:06.334 --> 00:35:08.236
Is that what you thought?

339
00:35:08.269 --> 00:35:09.270
No honey.

340
00:35:09.303 --> 00:35:10.771
No ransom for you.

341
00:35:13.441 --> 00:35:14.809
Help!

342
00:35:14.842 --> 00:35:16.511
Somebody help me!

343
00:35:24.385 --> 00:35:26.420
Now I do not want to have to
carve out


344
00:35:26.454 --> 00:35:27.822
that fucking tongue.

345
00:35:28.356 --> 00:35:30.324
But I certainly will do it.

346
00:35:34.795 --> 00:35:36.430
I'll do my job and you do yours

347
00:35:36.464 --> 00:35:38.900
and your job is to keep
fucking quiet!


348
00:35:41.469 --> 00:35:43.704
Are you gonna kill me?

349
00:35:47.975 --> 00:35:49.310
Let's just sit here and make quiet

350
00:35:49.343 --> 00:35:51.412
and not worry about what
can't control.


351
00:35:52.513 --> 00:35:54.782
I don't want to die.

352
00:36:04.292 --> 00:36:05.393
Hey doctor.

353
00:36:05.426 --> 00:36:06.561
Hey amigo.

354
00:36:06.594 --> 00:36:08.563
I am Hungarian you idiot.

355
00:36:08.863 --> 00:36:11.432
I don't speak the language.

356
00:36:11.732 --> 00:36:13.401
You got my money.

357
00:36:13.434 --> 00:36:14.669
Dinero.

358
00:36:15.636 --> 00:36:17.872
Is the other donor anemic?

359
00:36:18.339 --> 00:36:20.374
Not that I can see.

360
00:36:20.641 --> 00:36:23.778
I got O positive and
A positive on the menu today.


361
00:36:45.499 --> 00:36:48.436
And that the water was not a factor.

362
00:36:48.469 --> 00:36:50.738
In local news,
two year old Amanda Sherwood


363
00:36:50.771 --> 00:36:53.341
was found abandoned in a play
park explained


364
00:36:53.374 --> 00:36:55.576
by Sheriff Marks yesterday afternoon.

365
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:59.013
Aside from some very minor dehydration,

366
00:36:59.046 --> 00:37:02.283
the toddler was fine
according to ER doctors.


367
00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:04.518
The sheriff says Amanda's mother,

368
00:37:04.552 --> 00:37:07.722
Angela Sherwood who was last
seen with her daughter


369
00:37:07.755 --> 00:37:10.424
and at the same park,
has not been located


370
00:37:10.458 --> 00:37:12.526
as of this broadcast.

371
00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.662
Sheriff Marks also stands by
his claim


372
00:37:14.695 --> 00:37:17.031
that there was no sign of a struggle.

373
00:37:17.064 --> 00:37:19.367
And even though state
officials and the FBI


374
00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.335
have a asserted that they
wish to question


375
00:37:21.369 --> 00:37:22.670
Sherwood's husband,

376
00:37:22.703 --> 00:37:25.406
Marks says 31 year old
Theodore Hawkeye Sherwood


377
00:37:25.439 --> 00:37:28.509
is in fact not a suspect.

378
00:37:33.514 --> 00:37:36.484
Janalee get me the file on
the mother please.


379
00:37:39.453 --> 00:37:41.022
There's more pictures coming over

380
00:37:41.055 --> 00:37:42.556
to fax and I need just a minute.

381
00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:43.658
Okay thanks.

382
00:37:43.691 --> 00:37:44.859
And there's coffee.

383
00:37:44.892 --> 00:37:46.661
You don't have to buy me coffee.

384
00:37:46.694 --> 00:37:48.362
Thank you.

385
00:37:48.396 --> 00:37:51.465
Yeah no I found her at the
old oil field park.


386
00:37:52.433 --> 00:37:54.635
No there's no sign of foul play.

387
00:37:54.669 --> 00:37:58.939
Outside of the mother,
Angelica being MIA.


388
00:38:03.477 --> 00:38:04.679
No I had her husband in custody

389
00:38:04.712 --> 00:38:06.414
but he's not our culprit.

390
00:38:06.447 --> 00:38:07.581
No.

391
00:38:07.615 --> 00:38:08.549
No I won't.

392
00:38:08.582 --> 00:38:10.484
Look he's not our bad guy.

393
00:38:10.518 --> 00:38:12.586
You can print whatever you
damn well please.


394
00:38:13.554 --> 00:38:16.090
Okay look as soon as I find
something out,


395
00:38:16.123 --> 00:38:18.526
you'd be the first to know.

396
00:38:18.826 --> 00:38:20.428
Alright.

397
00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:31.005
Damn press.

398
00:38:31.038 --> 00:38:32.773
Son of a bitch!

399
00:38:34.742 --> 00:38:38.045
Sheriff the volunteers found
human remains in that fire.


400
00:38:39.513 --> 00:38:41.782
I know Virgil called me on my
cell phone.


401
00:38:42.016 --> 00:38:43.617
I'm sorry you had to hear the
gory details


402
00:38:43.651 --> 00:38:45.720
on that one Janalee.

403
00:38:45.753 --> 00:38:47.922
Her name was Pepper Nixon.

404
00:38:47.955 --> 00:38:49.724
She was a cheerleader from Dempsey.

405
00:38:49.757 --> 00:38:52.526
Eric Larson found her car
about two miles up the road.


406
00:38:53.661 --> 00:38:55.863
The coroners going to get
your full report on Monday.


407
00:38:58.632 --> 00:39:00.534
That makes three dead girls.

408
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:05.539
Three dead and 12 missing
that we know of.


409
00:39:06.173 --> 00:39:09.677
Looks like we're gonna burn
the midnight on this one.


410
00:39:47.281 --> 00:39:49.950
So for you, we wait.

411
00:39:50.518 --> 00:39:52.820
I don't know what you want
from me.


412
00:39:53.954 --> 00:39:55.990
That's for the good doctor to decide.

413
00:40:00.027 --> 00:40:01.996
Can I have some water?

414
00:40:02.029 --> 00:40:03.697
I'm really thirsty.

415
00:40:03.731 --> 00:40:05.766
You'll thank me later if I decline.

416
00:40:07.134 --> 00:40:09.036
I doubt it.

417
00:40:10.738 --> 00:40:12.673
What'd you do for a living,

418
00:40:12.706 --> 00:40:14.175
back in the world?

419
00:40:15.209 --> 00:40:16.944
What?

420
00:40:16.977 --> 00:40:18.946
You got nice boots,

421
00:40:18.979 --> 00:40:20.247
expensive guitar,

422
00:40:20.648 --> 00:40:21.982
you must work.

423
00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:25.186
That guitar was a gift.

424
00:40:26.554 --> 00:40:28.522
The boots I got from a thrift store.

425
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:31.692
I got my last vehicle from
the good wish.


426
00:40:32.092 --> 00:40:33.727
600 dollars, cash and money.

427
00:40:36.997 --> 00:40:39.166
Why did you put a needle in
my arm?


428
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.036
Well I had to know you're
blood type.


429
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:43.838
A positive.

430
00:40:44.071 --> 00:40:47.007
Oh your HIV negative by the way.

431
00:40:47.041 --> 00:40:48.876
You drew my blood?

432
00:40:48.909 --> 00:40:50.711
This isn't a hospital.

433
00:40:50.744 --> 00:40:51.879
You're not a doctor.

434
00:40:51.912 --> 00:40:53.080
This isn't sterile.

435
00:40:53.714 --> 00:40:55.249
What did you do to me?

436
00:40:55.983 --> 00:40:56.884
The police are gonna find you

437
00:40:56.917 --> 00:40:58.319
and you're gonna go to prison.

438
00:40:58.352 --> 00:41:00.120
Don't test me you little bitch.

439
00:41:01.856 --> 00:41:03.257
You're crazy.

440
00:41:07.928 --> 00:41:10.931
Won't do you no good to smooch
my butt darling.


441
00:41:13.133 --> 00:41:15.035
What's that noise.

442
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:18.806
It's a hostage situations.

443
00:41:20.107 --> 00:41:24.111
Capture his prey close together.

444
00:41:24.712 --> 00:41:27.281
Developed sort of a personal relationship.

445
00:41:28.916 --> 00:41:31.051
They've got stockholm syndrome.

446
00:41:33.988 --> 00:41:36.156
That will happen to you neither.

447
00:41:37.658 --> 00:41:39.660
What are you doing?

448
00:41:41.061 --> 00:41:42.296
It's...

449
00:41:42.997 --> 00:41:45.299
It's the girl in the posters.

450
00:41:48.369 --> 00:41:51.071
Where's (mumbles)

451
00:41:51.105 --> 00:41:52.106
She's safe and sound,

452
00:41:52.139 --> 00:41:53.974
right where we left her.

453
00:41:54.008 --> 00:41:55.276
Where's my baby.

454
00:41:56.143 --> 00:41:57.978
Where is her baby?

455
00:41:58.646 --> 00:42:00.080
Toddler hun.

456
00:42:00.314 --> 00:42:02.816
Now she had been a healthy newborn.

457
00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:04.652
My money would have been made
for the year.


458
00:42:04.685 --> 00:42:06.720
What kind of answer is that?

459
00:42:06.754 --> 00:42:08.255
Where is her baby?

460
00:42:08.289 --> 00:42:11.025
I'm beginning to tire of your attitude.

461
00:42:11.725 --> 00:42:14.995
I'll I'm asking is her baby
gonna be okay?


462
00:42:15.863 --> 00:42:17.898
That's none of my concern.

463
00:42:20.334 --> 00:42:23.304
Don't hurt her please

464
00:42:23.337 --> 00:42:26.040
What is her name do you even
know that much?


465
00:42:27.441 --> 00:42:29.043
Yes I do.

466
00:42:30.077 --> 00:42:31.345
Her names Dee.

467
00:42:32.146 --> 00:42:33.981
Dinero.

468
00:42:35.149 --> 00:42:36.817
Show time kiddo.

469
00:42:37.151 --> 00:42:38.852
Not for you.

470
00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.229
That hurt!

471
00:48:20.627 --> 00:48:23.263
Oh honey I'm home.

472
00:48:23.697 --> 00:48:27.067
Amanda, Sergio, what are you doing?

473
00:48:27.701 --> 00:48:29.736
What am I doing home early?

474
00:48:30.404 --> 00:48:32.205
Surprise!

475
00:48:33.173 --> 00:48:37.311
This is what you get for
taking all my fucking money.


476
00:48:38.445 --> 00:48:40.180
Fucking take everything

477
00:48:40.213 --> 00:48:41.581
fucking away from me.

478
00:48:43.717 --> 00:48:45.619
But you didn't get my weed.

479
00:48:46.053 --> 00:48:47.220
Yeah.

480
00:48:47.254 --> 00:48:50.324
(Mumbles)

481
00:48:52.559 --> 00:48:54.127
I can't get a break.

482
00:48:58.165 --> 00:48:59.399
Fuck.

483
00:48:59.433 --> 00:49:01.001
I'm too stoned.

484
00:49:05.706 --> 00:49:07.808
God damn, a shooting star.

485
00:49:07.841 --> 00:49:10.243
Alright let me wish.

486
00:49:12.245 --> 00:49:14.214
I wish I had a big dick.

487
00:49:14.614 --> 00:49:17.017
I wish I had a new recording studio.

488
00:49:19.152 --> 00:49:22.122
And I wish I had a woman with
natural tits.


489
00:49:23.724 --> 00:49:26.159
That'd be nice for a change.

490
00:49:27.627 --> 00:49:29.396
It didn't work.

491
00:49:29.429 --> 00:49:31.798
(Mumbles)

492
00:49:31.832 --> 00:49:34.568
Good luck getting it now bitch.

493
00:49:34.601 --> 00:49:36.403
Good luck getting it now.

494
00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:22.449
Eric Larson.

495
00:50:23.784 --> 00:50:24.851
What can I do you for?

496
00:50:24.885 --> 00:50:26.119
Hi sheriff,

497
00:50:26.153 --> 00:50:27.587
you still paying cash for tips?

498
00:50:27.621 --> 00:50:28.822
Well, well hold on there.

499
00:50:28.855 --> 00:50:30.624
Let me be the judge of that.

500
00:50:30.891 --> 00:50:32.659
First of all how are you and
your mom getting along,


501
00:50:32.692 --> 00:50:33.493
okay?

502
00:50:33.527 --> 00:50:34.761
No.

503
00:50:34.795 --> 00:50:35.829
Mommas got the gout and a
little diarrhea


504
00:50:35.862 --> 00:50:37.164
with corn in it.

505
00:50:41.868 --> 00:50:43.003
Well I'm sorry to hear that.

506
00:50:43.036 --> 00:50:45.839
Now I surely will be out
there right soon to visit.


507
00:50:46.807 --> 00:50:49.142
So Eric what about this tip?

508
00:50:51.878 --> 00:50:53.847
No I wasn't aware.

509
00:50:55.515 --> 00:50:57.350
Your cousin you say?

510
00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:02.355
Not one delivery?

511
00:51:13.733 --> 00:51:15.902
Now what diner are we talking about?

512
00:52:14.528 --> 00:52:15.862
Hello?

513
00:52:15.896 --> 00:52:17.764
Yeah, how do I know?

514
00:52:18.365 --> 00:52:20.667
Your car, your piece of shit

515
00:52:22.702 --> 00:52:24.337
Oh no.

516
00:52:24.638 --> 00:52:26.740
I'm definitely not gonna wait
for you.


517
00:52:27.007 --> 00:52:30.343
Maybe some nice trucker could
give me a ride back.


518
00:52:32.812 --> 00:52:34.581
My shorts?

519
00:52:35.482 --> 00:52:37.484
Oh their shorts sweetie.

520
00:52:40.487 --> 00:52:42.289
You don't even know what
you're doing.


521
00:52:42.322 --> 00:52:43.957
You don't even take care of it

522
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:45.792
and look what happened,
I'm stuck now.

00:53:39.079 --> 00:53:41.014
But at least I got my weed.

00:53:44.918 --> 00:53:46.620
Ah yes.

526
00:53:48.655 --> 00:53:50.390

527
00:53:50.991 --> 00:53:53.326

528
00:53:54.094 --> 00:53:55.662
Fuck.

529
00:53:55.695 --> 00:53:58.365
Well at least I have my booze.

530
00:54:00.066 --> 00:54:02.602
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

531
00:54:02.702 --> 00:54:04.037

532
00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:04.971

You have to help me.

537
00:54:08.375 --> 00:54:09.509
You need a first aid kit?

538
00:54:09.542 --> 00:54:11.511
There's a man out there he's crazy.

539
00:54:11.544 --> 00:54:13.680
Do you have a phone,
do you have radio?


540
00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:15.482
Yes I've got a phone.

541
00:54:15.515 --> 00:54:16.950
Listen relax, who's after you.

542
00:54:16.983 --> 00:54:18.518
It's a man.

543
00:54:18.551 --> 00:54:21.521
He kidnapped me and there's
another woman too.


544
00:54:21.988 --> 00:54:22.956
What?

545
00:54:22.989 --> 00:54:24.024
Okay look.

546
00:54:24.057 --> 00:54:25.392
Listen, come here.

547
00:54:25.425 --> 00:54:26.526
I want you to sit down over here.

548
00:54:26.559 --> 00:54:27.560
Okay?

549
00:54:27.594 --> 00:54:28.561
No, no, no.

550
00:54:28.595 --> 00:54:29.729
What?

551
00:54:29.763 --> 00:54:30.897
He kidnapped me and he's
about a mile in a half back


552
00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:33.466
and there's another woman,
she's gonna die if we don't


553
00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:34.534
do something.

554
00:54:34.567 --> 00:54:35.468
Alright.

555
00:54:35.502 --> 00:54:36.102
We have to go.

556
00:54:36.136 --> 00:54:36.870
Here, here.

557
00:54:36.903 --> 00:54:37.704
Dial 911 right now.

558
00:54:37.737 --> 00:54:38.938
Hold on.

559
00:54:42.575 --> 00:54:44.511
Where is he coming from?

560
00:54:44.544 --> 00:54:45.679
Does he got a knife?

561
00:54:45.712 --> 00:54:46.579
Does he got a gun?

562
00:54:46.613 --> 00:54:48.682
I don't know a gun, I don't know.

563
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:51.651
Just dial 911.

564
00:54:51.685 --> 00:54:53.019
Dial 911.

565
00:54:54.754 --> 00:54:55.655
Oh my,

566
00:54:55.689 --> 00:54:56.890
hello?

567
00:54:56.923 --> 00:54:58.391
You lost signal.

568
00:54:59.059 --> 00:54:59.959
What?

569
00:54:59.993 --> 00:55:00.827
Oh my god.

570
00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:01.928
Did you get through?

571
00:55:01.961 --> 00:55:03.096
Your stupid phones not working.

572
00:55:03.129 --> 00:55:05.065
Listen, listen,
listen you got through.


573
00:55:05.098 --> 00:55:06.700
It's got a GPS on it

574
00:55:06.733 --> 00:55:09.402
and they'll pick us up and
they'll come out here.


575
00:55:09.736 --> 00:55:11.538
Okay when you dial 911 that's
what it does.


576
00:55:11.571 --> 00:55:12.706
Come here, stand up.

577
00:55:12.739 --> 00:55:14.407
Stand up, come on.

578
00:55:14.607 --> 00:55:15.842
Come on.

579
00:55:16.109 --> 00:55:17.444
Now look there's nobody..

580
00:55:17.477 --> 00:55:18.611
No, no,
no we have to go to the house


581
00:55:18.645 --> 00:55:19.646
because there's another woman.

582
00:55:19.679 --> 00:55:20.580
What house?

583
00:55:20.613 --> 00:55:21.548
She's gonna die.

584
00:55:21.581 --> 00:55:22.582
Nobody's gonna...

585
00:55:22.615 --> 00:55:23.650
Okay look.

586
00:55:23.683 --> 00:55:24.684
No it's that way.

587
00:55:24.718 --> 00:55:25.618
Okay look,

588
00:55:25.652 --> 00:55:28.088
we can't go anywhere now it's
pitch dark.


589
00:55:28.121 --> 00:55:29.689
We're not gonna find anything.

590
00:55:29.723 --> 00:55:30.924
How did you get here?

591
00:55:30.957 --> 00:55:32.559
Do you have a car?

592
00:55:32.592 --> 00:55:33.460
Of course I have a car.

593
00:55:33.493 --> 00:55:35.462
What do you think I came here
on a camel?


594
00:55:35.495 --> 00:55:36.429
I got a car.

595
00:55:36.463 --> 00:55:37.664
It's up there somewhere.

596
00:55:37.697 --> 00:55:39.666
But it's so fucking dark
right now.


597
00:55:39.966 --> 00:55:41.167
Relax.

598
00:55:41.201 --> 00:55:42.702
Okay?

599
00:55:42.736 --> 00:55:43.703
I'm so scared.

600
00:55:43.737 --> 00:55:44.871
It's alright.

601
00:55:44.904 --> 00:55:47.040
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.


602
00:55:47.574 --> 00:55:49.442
I've got an idea.

603
00:55:49.476 --> 00:55:51.010
I got some weed.

604
00:55:51.044 --> 00:55:52.679
It's not much.

605
00:55:52.912 --> 00:55:54.814
But it'll take the edge off.

606
00:55:54.848 --> 00:55:56.683
Wanna smoke some weed?

607
00:55:56.716 --> 00:55:58.585
Come on this is good stuff.

608
00:55:59.252 --> 00:56:00.687

614
00:56:08.828 --> 00:56:09.796

We're gonna get that out okay?

618
00:56:14.834 --> 00:56:16.102
He took my blood.

619
00:56:16.136 --> 00:56:17.771
He took your blood?

620
00:56:17.804 --> 00:56:19.606
He took my blood.

621
00:56:19.639 --> 00:56:21.007
He took your blood.

622
00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:23.810
Okay come over here and sit down.

623
00:56:24.177 --> 00:56:25.745
Okay and then we're gonna
take that thing


624
00:56:25.779 --> 00:56:27.781
out of your arm and I just
want you to relax.


625
00:56:28.248 --> 00:56:30.049
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.


626
00:56:30.583 --> 00:56:32.218
Let's stake this out,

627
00:56:32.252 --> 00:56:33.787
be real careful.

628
00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:34.754
Okay?

629
00:56:35.288 --> 00:56:36.656
Alright.

630
00:56:36.689 --> 00:56:38.691
The other woman at the house.

631
00:56:38.725 --> 00:56:41.628
Listen let's not worry about
that other lady right now.


632
00:56:41.661 --> 00:56:43.563
You're here and you're safe

633
00:56:43.596 --> 00:56:45.198
and that's all that matters
right now.


634
00:56:45.231 --> 00:56:46.766
I promise you.

635
00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:48.668
We're gonna get the rangers,
they've got guns,


636
00:56:48.701 --> 00:56:50.603
they've got dogs and helicopters

637
00:56:50.637 --> 00:56:53.807
and stuff we'll find that lady
and she's gonna be safe too.


638
00:56:54.073 --> 00:56:56.242
You just gotta have faith okay?

00:57:00.547 --> 00:57:02.482
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.


642
00:57:02.816 --> 00:57:04.250
Alright come on.

643
00:57:04.284 --> 00:57:06.553
Take a deep breath.

644
00:57:06.586 --> 00:57:07.654
It's okay.

645
00:57:07.687 --> 00:57:09.289
Let's just get this thing off you,

646
00:57:09.322 --> 00:57:10.723
this looks nasty.

647
00:57:10.757 --> 00:57:11.925
Okay.

648
00:57:12.325 --> 00:57:13.927
Fuck, here.

649
00:57:14.794 --> 00:57:15.995
Fuck.

650
00:57:16.029 --> 00:57:17.764
Wrap this around here.

651
00:57:17.797 --> 00:57:19.766
We just gotta wrap this up there

652
00:57:19.799 --> 00:57:20.834
and you're gonna be safe.

653
00:57:20.867 --> 00:57:22.135
Now the rangers are gonna come.

654
00:57:22.168 --> 00:57:23.736
There's nothing we can do
right now


655
00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:25.805
'cause it's pitch dark and
you can't go anywhere.


656
00:57:26.105 --> 00:57:27.807
But you stay right here,

657
00:57:27.841 --> 00:57:28.908
in this camp.

658
00:57:28.942 --> 00:57:29.943
We got a fire.

659
00:57:29.976 --> 00:57:31.077
I got my ax.

660
00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:32.612
We're gonna be okay.

661
00:57:32.645 --> 00:57:34.681
Alright and I'm just gonna
keep calling.


662
00:57:34.714 --> 00:57:36.916
Now why don't you go in there
and sleep in my tent?


663
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:37.884
Okay?

664
00:57:37.917 --> 00:57:39.085
Okay.

665
00:57:39.118 --> 00:57:40.286
Alright?

666
00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:42.021
It's gonna be alright baby,

667
00:57:42.055 --> 00:57:43.289
Come on.

668
00:57:43.323 --> 00:57:44.924
It's alright.

669
00:57:44.958 --> 00:57:47.026
I've been through worse.

670
00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:48.895
You ever been divorced?

671
00:57:48.928 --> 00:57:50.797
It's worse than murder.

672
00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:51.798
Come on.

673
00:57:51.831 --> 00:57:54.634
Come on I'm just trying to
make you laugh okay?


674
00:57:55.168 --> 00:57:57.070
It's gonna be okay.

675
00:57:57.904 --> 00:57:58.738
It's gonna be okay.

676
00:57:58.771 --> 00:57:59.906
I'm gonna sit here.

677
00:57:59.939 --> 00:58:01.307
I cant afford to sleep.

678
00:58:01.341 --> 00:58:02.775
Okay?

679
00:58:02.809 --> 00:58:05.812
I'm so broke right now,
I can't afford to sleep.


680
00:58:06.312 --> 00:58:07.981
So I'm gonna stay up all night

681
00:58:08.014 --> 00:58:09.749
and I'm gonna watch.

682
00:58:09.782 --> 00:58:12.218
You need to get some rest and
as soon as the sun comes up


683
00:58:12.252 --> 00:58:14.888
we're gonna head right to the
ranger station okay?


684
00:58:15.788 --> 00:58:17.724
I want to stay out with you.

685
00:58:17.757 --> 00:58:19.158
You want to stay out here
with me?


686
00:58:19.192 --> 00:58:21.694
Yeah we can talk.

687
00:58:22.061 --> 00:58:22.996
Okay.

688
00:58:23.029 --> 00:58:24.831
Yeah we can talk if you want.

689
00:58:24.864 --> 00:58:25.865
Come on over here.

690
00:58:25.899 --> 00:58:27.834
Come on sit down.

00:58:29.936 --> 00:58:31.738

692
00:58:31.771 --> 00:58:32.739
Your names Sally?

693
00:58:32.772 --> 00:58:33.873
Mhm.

694
00:58:33.907 --> 00:58:35.108
Alright Sally.

695
00:58:35.642 --> 00:58:36.809
Alright.

696
00:58:37.944 --> 00:58:39.145
It's okay baby don't worry.

697
00:58:39.178 --> 00:58:41.814
Listen this is for our protection.

698
00:58:42.649 --> 00:58:44.918
You don't want any of that
weed huh?


699
00:58:45.184 --> 00:58:46.286
Fuck it.

700
00:58:46.319 --> 00:58:48.288
It's shake anyways.

701
00:58:48.321 --> 00:58:49.756
Fuck it.

702
00:58:50.123 --> 00:58:51.991
You're divorced?

703
00:58:52.025 --> 00:58:53.660
Yeah.

704
00:58:56.329 --> 00:58:59.799
The wife got the recording studio.

00:59:09.208 --> 00:59:10.710
She got everything?

708
00:59:10.743 --> 00:59:12.145
She got everything.

709
00:59:13.813 --> 00:59:15.882
A hundred thousand dollars.

710
00:59:15.915 --> 00:59:18.318
Good luck getting it now.

711
00:59:22.322 --> 00:59:24.857
I did laugh at it now.

712
00:59:26.092 --> 00:59:27.927
You're gonna be alright.

713
00:59:27.961 --> 00:59:29.662
Now tell me where you from?

714
00:59:30.930 --> 00:59:32.899

715
00:59:32.932 --> 00:59:35.001
What kind of music you like?

717
00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:39.205
Oh know listen baby I'm just

718
00:59:39.238 --> 00:59:41.841
your mind off of things right

719
00:59:42.241 --> 00:59:43.810
So tell me about Colorado.

720
00:59:43.843 --> 00:59:45.311
Tell me about Colorado.

721
00:59:45.345 --> 00:59:46.746
What was it like?

722
00:59:46.779 --> 00:59:47.714
Huh?

723
00:59:47.747 --> 00:59:48.748
My dads there.

724
00:59:48.781 --> 00:59:49.916
Your dads there?

725
00:59:49.949 --> 00:59:50.817
Yeah.

726
00:59:50.850 --> 00:59:51.951
He'll be happy to see you.

727
00:59:51.985 --> 00:59:53.820
Were you going to see your dad?

728
00:59:53.853 --> 00:59:55.254
Yeah.

729
00:59:55.288 --> 00:59:56.923
Yeah okay.

730
00:59:57.857 --> 00:59:59.325
That's cool.

731
00:59:59.359 --> 01:00:00.793
Listen you're gonna be okay.

732
01:00:00.827 --> 01:00:02.261
I know it was a really
frightening experience


733
01:00:02.295 --> 01:00:03.830
that you had happen to you.

734
01:00:03.863 --> 01:00:06.265
But you gotta trust me,
you're gonna be okay.


735
01:00:06.299 --> 01:00:07.834
Look at me, look at me.

736
01:00:07.867 --> 01:00:08.735
You're okay.

737
01:00:08.768 --> 01:00:10.937
Look I'm gonna let you wear
my hat.


738
01:00:11.838 --> 01:00:13.339
That's gonna make you strong okay?

739
01:00:13.906 --> 01:00:16.175
A very strong person gave me
that hat once.


740
01:00:16.209 --> 01:00:18.778
And he said wear that hat for courage.

741
01:00:18.811 --> 01:00:19.979
So I want you to wear that hat

742
01:00:20.013 --> 01:00:21.447
and you'll have courage okay?

743
01:00:21.481 --> 01:00:23.316
Nothings gonna happen to you
as long as you're


744
01:00:23.349 --> 01:00:24.917
wearing that hat.

745
01:00:24.951 --> 01:00:26.886
You're kind of weird aren't you?

746
01:00:27.987 --> 01:00:29.255
It's so fucking weird.

747
01:00:29.288 --> 01:00:30.990
You remind me of my dad.

748
01:00:31.024 --> 01:00:32.258
Really?

749
01:00:32.291 --> 01:00:33.826
Well thank you.

750
01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:37.463
Well I wish if I'd had a daughter,

751
01:00:37.497 --> 01:00:40.066
that she would have been just
like you,


752
01:00:40.099 --> 01:00:42.368
'cause you look like you're a
good person.


753
01:00:45.238 --> 01:00:46.506
I'm really tired.

754
01:00:46.539 --> 01:00:47.674
I know you are.

755
01:00:47.707 --> 01:00:51.144
You know what, why don't you
go sleep in the tent okay?


756
01:00:51.177 --> 01:00:52.512
Is it gonna be safe?

757
01:00:52.545 --> 01:00:53.913
Are you kidding?

758
01:00:53.946 --> 01:00:55.248
It's gonna be light in just
a few hours.


759
01:00:56.049 --> 01:00:57.283
Really.

760
01:00:57.316 --> 01:00:58.751
Come on.

761
01:00:58.785 --> 01:00:59.919
Come on in the tent.

762
01:00:59.952 --> 01:01:01.888
Come on and everything's
gonna be okay.


763
01:01:01.921 --> 01:01:03.122
Keep the hat with you and
you wanna take


764
01:01:03.156 --> 01:01:04.791
the flashlight too?

765
01:01:04.824 --> 01:01:06.192
Take the flashlight.

766
01:01:07.193 --> 01:01:10.096
Now keep that arm on elevated
up over your heart okay?


767
01:01:10.129 --> 01:01:11.898
Okay.

768
01:01:11.931 --> 01:01:14.901
'Cause then the bleeding's
gonna stop.


769
01:01:14.934 --> 01:01:17.203
Just get in here and just lie down.

770
01:01:17.236 --> 01:01:19.238
It's gonna be sunlight real
soon Sally okay?


771
01:01:19.272 --> 01:01:21.240
And then we're gonna go right
to the rangers station.


772
01:01:21.441 --> 01:01:23.042
Thank you.

773
01:01:23.076 --> 01:01:24.243
You're welcome.

774
01:01:24.977 --> 01:01:26.946
Everything's gonna be okay.

775
01:01:26.979 --> 01:01:28.815
I'm gonna keep watch.

776
01:01:33.953 --> 01:01:35.788
It's gonna be okay.

777
01:01:35.822 --> 01:01:38.191
Alright you can leave it half
open there


778
01:01:38.224 --> 01:01:40.026
so you can see I'm right here.

779
01:01:41.994 --> 01:01:43.463
Fuck.

780
01:01:49.435 --> 01:01:52.872
Ain't that the perfect cheery
on top of a fucking sundae.


781
01:02:11.124 --> 01:02:12.325
Yeah.

782
01:02:12.358 --> 01:02:14.927
You come here and camp
Mr. fucking maniac.


783
01:02:14.961 --> 01:02:17.029
I'll chop you up to bits.

784
01:02:17.296 --> 01:02:19.198
Yeah.

785
01:02:19.232 --> 01:02:21.100
Watch out for me.

786
01:02:21.134 --> 01:02:22.401
I'm trained.

787
01:02:25.171 --> 01:02:27.173
Axe deodorant.

788
01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.275
Ax the television series.

789
01:02:32.545 --> 01:02:34.147
Ax the cereal.

790
01:02:35.181 --> 01:02:36.849
Ax the murder.

791
01:02:38.084 --> 01:02:39.519
Ax me how I'm feeling.

792
01:02:39.552 --> 01:02:41.254
I'm pretty high actually.

793
01:03:02.675 --> 01:03:04.877
Hello?

794
01:03:15.555 --> 01:03:17.290
Hello?

795
01:03:20.226 --> 01:03:22.061
Hey I'm here.

796
01:03:22.094 --> 01:03:23.162
You alright?

797
01:03:23.196 --> 01:03:24.297
What were you doing?

798
01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:25.298
What, what..

799
01:03:25.331 --> 01:03:26.933
I was so scared.

800
01:03:26.966 --> 01:03:28.568
Oh baby.

801
01:03:29.235 --> 01:03:31.070
Oh come on.

802
01:03:31.537 --> 01:03:33.906
I'm here, it's okay.

803
01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:36.209
Oh my god you really are
freaked out huh?


804
01:03:36.242 --> 01:03:37.977
Oh my god.

805
01:03:38.211 --> 01:03:41.147
Alright look I'm just walking
around trying to get a signal


806
01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:42.114
for the phone.

807
01:03:42.148 --> 01:03:43.216
Okay?

808
01:03:43.249 --> 01:03:45.918
GPS isn't gonna work unless
I get signal right?


809
01:03:46.219 --> 01:03:47.153
Right?

810
01:03:47.186 --> 01:03:48.087
Let's just go.

811
01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.322
Can we just go,
lets just grab the hatchet


812
01:03:49.355 --> 01:03:51.023
and we can just go.

813
01:03:51.057 --> 01:03:54.026
You're really fucking freaked
out aren't you?


814
01:03:55.027 --> 01:03:58.130
God I told you everything's
gonna be alright baby.


815
01:03:58.164 --> 01:04:01.167
The rangers have got guns and
they've got choppers


816
01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.236
and dogs and all kinds of stuff.

817
01:04:03.269 --> 01:04:05.104
They'll get this guy alright?

818
01:04:05.137 --> 01:04:06.205
We're gonna be alright.

819
01:04:06.239 --> 01:04:07.707
We're gonna be fine.

820
01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:09.942
Wanna smoke some of this weed
I got?


821
01:04:09.976 --> 01:04:11.110
It'll take the edge off.

822
01:04:13.546 --> 01:04:16.415
Oh my god I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.


823
01:04:16.749 --> 01:04:18.417
We're gonna be totally alright.

824
01:05:21.314 --> 01:05:23.182
Hello?

825
01:06:52.505 --> 01:06:54.240
What did you do?

826
01:06:54.273 --> 01:06:55.441
What did you do to him?

827
01:06:55.474 --> 01:06:57.243
You brought him into this not me.

828
01:06:57.276 --> 01:06:59.311
Keep that straight alright?

829
01:07:02.214 --> 01:07:04.483
Now I just soon keep you in
one piece,


830
01:07:04.517 --> 01:07:06.385
but I'll sure as shit pop you
in the knee cap


831
01:07:06.419 --> 01:07:07.686
if I feel the need.

832
01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.388
Understand?

833
01:07:12.324 --> 01:07:14.460
Please don't.

834
01:07:19.498 --> 01:07:22.268
Did I not make myself
perfectly clear?


835
01:07:25.538 --> 01:07:29.141
Now look at the mess you've
gone and made.


836
01:08:00.473 --> 01:08:03.409
Now I'm expecting a call from
my doctor friend.


837
01:08:03.943 --> 01:08:06.712
He'll let me know if he got any
need for your vitals or not.


838
01:08:08.481 --> 01:08:10.483
Till then you just sit tight.

839
01:08:12.952 --> 01:08:14.720
Now it's much better to have
a bone saw


840
01:08:14.753 --> 01:08:16.422
and not need one.

841
01:08:16.455 --> 01:08:18.457
When you need one, not have one.

842
01:08:18.491 --> 01:08:20.192
Right?

843
01:08:24.563 --> 01:08:26.632
Don't leave me here to die.

844
01:08:29.468 --> 01:08:31.504
If I was gonna kill you,
it's to kill you.


845
01:08:31.537 --> 01:08:33.539
You'd be dead already.

846
01:08:36.509 --> 01:08:38.444
It looks like the moment of
truth little one.


847
01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:42.448
Oh.

848
01:08:43.015 --> 01:08:44.884
Look at that.

849
01:08:44.917 --> 01:08:46.752
Wrong number.

850
01:08:49.622 --> 01:08:52.291
This is one of those prepaid jobs.

851
01:08:52.324 --> 01:08:54.727
I don't get no nights,
weekends, none of that stuff.


852
01:08:56.795 --> 01:08:59.765
The phone company,
there's your real criminals.


853
01:09:05.337 --> 01:09:07.907
Now if I loosen up that gag,
you'll be quiet?


854
01:09:22.621 --> 01:09:24.590
I'd offer you some but...

855
01:09:26.725 --> 01:09:28.594
What's that there.

856
01:09:28.994 --> 01:09:31.797
This is cat meat from our
friends tent.


857
01:09:33.032 --> 01:09:34.533
Want some?

858
01:09:34.567 --> 01:09:36.001
He wasn't my friend.

859
01:09:37.002 --> 01:09:39.505
I didn't even know his name.

860
01:09:42.441 --> 01:09:45.511
Just wrong place, wrong time.

861
01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.616
That's all it takes to get a
rise out of you?


862
01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:52.718
All it takes?

863
01:09:53.752 --> 01:09:55.287
Mmm.

864
01:09:55.321 --> 01:09:57.556
You just killed two people
right in front of me.


865
01:09:58.557 --> 01:09:59.892
Rise?

866
01:10:00.092 --> 01:10:01.527
Man's gotta do what man's
gotta do.


867
01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:02.861
I had to support my family.

868
01:10:02.895 --> 01:10:04.597
What's wrong with you?

869
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:06.832
Now your real money is in
spinal research.


870
01:10:07.533 --> 01:10:10.669
Stem cells,
you know fresh baby fetus's.


871
01:10:11.637 --> 01:10:13.272
Embryo's.

872
01:10:13.539 --> 01:10:15.541
They're hard to get though.

873
01:10:15.574 --> 01:10:17.576
I would hope so.

874
01:10:17.876 --> 01:10:20.446
One time at the abortion
clinic in St. Louis,


875
01:10:20.479 --> 01:10:22.681
I almost got arrested.

876
01:10:22.715 --> 01:10:24.984
They were just throwing them
out anyway.


877
01:10:31.657 --> 01:10:33.826
That's a nice guitar.

878
01:10:33.859 --> 01:10:35.594
You should hold onto this.

879
01:10:36.629 --> 01:10:38.564
You should keep it after you
murder me.


880
01:10:40.899 --> 01:10:42.668
It's been awhile.

881
01:11:06.525 --> 01:11:09.662
♪ Freight train,
freight train going so fast


882
01:11:09.695 --> 01:11:12.731
♪ Freight train,
freight train going so fast


883
01:11:13.565 --> 01:11:16.468
♪ Don't tell them which train
I'm on


884
01:11:16.835 --> 01:11:19.638
♪ And they will know where
I've gone ♪


885
01:11:56.875 --> 01:11:58.744
Now that's no good.

886
01:12:21.233 --> 01:12:23.435
So I can go now?

887
01:12:23.469 --> 01:12:25.104
Now what gave you that idea?

888
01:12:37.683 --> 01:12:39.785
See now look at that.

889
01:12:40.853 --> 01:12:42.955
Everything could be alright.

890
01:12:43.489 --> 01:12:44.990
So that's it?

891
01:12:46.191 --> 01:12:48.694
You're just gonna cut me lose
and then


892
01:12:48.727 --> 01:12:50.863
sayonara Sally?

893
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:53.932
Ferris wheel rides over.

894
01:12:53.966 --> 01:12:55.667
Everybody off.

895
01:12:59.538 --> 01:13:02.007
I reckon the worlds a better
place with you still in it.


896
01:13:04.243 --> 01:13:06.211
Can I call my family?

897
01:13:06.979 --> 01:13:08.647
I don't think that's best.

898
01:13:10.282 --> 01:13:13.118
When I leave I'll turn your
phone on.


899
01:13:13.152 --> 01:13:16.188
But you lose your calling
privileges if I even suspect


900
01:13:16.221 --> 01:13:17.189
you're trying to..

901
01:13:17.222 --> 01:13:19.091
You won't, you won't I promise.

902
01:13:22.561 --> 01:13:25.564
Can I have some coffee?

903
01:13:25.597 --> 01:13:27.666
I'll set you up a spot outside.

904
01:13:28.834 --> 01:13:31.203
I have to use the bathroom.

905
01:13:33.105 --> 01:13:34.840
Well I hope you're not shy.

906
01:13:41.547 --> 01:13:43.849
We had a 911 call last night.

907
01:13:44.283 --> 01:13:46.185
The call was too short to get
a ping


908
01:13:46.218 --> 01:13:47.686
but we have a number and a name.

909
01:13:47.719 --> 01:13:49.154
Let's have it.

910
01:13:49.188 --> 01:13:50.088
Woody Busto.

911
01:13:50.122 --> 01:13:52.891
No priors not even a speeding ticket.

912
01:13:53.892 --> 01:13:56.228
It was a woman who called on
his phone.


913
01:14:04.803 --> 01:14:05.971
There it is.

914
01:14:06.004 --> 01:14:07.072
Windsor Hills.

915
01:14:07.105 --> 01:14:08.841
The forest near the diner.

916
01:14:33.665 --> 01:14:35.834
I got you.

917
01:15:18.377 --> 01:15:20.946
Nice knife huh?

918
01:15:27.386 --> 01:15:29.688
Help me push this thing come on.

919
01:15:35.093 --> 01:15:37.863
Now don't you think if they
clean this place up,


920
01:15:37.896 --> 01:15:40.198
I could have rented it by now.

921
01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.802
Sure okay.

922
01:15:44.036 --> 01:15:45.971
I'll get your stuff for you.

923
01:15:46.004 --> 01:15:47.639
You want a chair to sit on?

924
01:15:48.774 --> 01:15:50.242
No thanks.

925
01:15:50.275 --> 01:15:51.677
Suit yourself.

926
01:15:52.144 --> 01:15:55.180
Hey don't go anywhere now.

927
01:16:07.893 --> 01:16:09.861
I can use my pack.

928
01:16:29.214 --> 01:16:31.783
Well thank you Benjamin.

929
01:16:52.204 --> 01:16:54.906
Babies are so precious.

930
01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:56.975
Worth their weight in gold.

931
01:16:59.444 --> 01:17:01.213
Damn.

932
01:17:13.258 --> 01:17:16.194
I don't think you heard me
before but


933
01:17:16.228 --> 01:17:18.397
if it wouldn't be too much
trouble if...


934
01:17:19.464 --> 01:17:22.167
But you can sit my pack next
to me


935
01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.203
and I can use it as a stool.

936
01:17:29.207 --> 01:17:31.176
I don't need the chair.

937
01:17:33.178 --> 01:17:35.247
Mr. (Mumbles)

938
01:19:09.241 --> 01:19:10.609
Good morning.

939
01:19:10.642 --> 01:19:12.477
It is indeed a good morning.

940
01:19:13.512 --> 01:19:16.047
We got fresh hot chili in the kitchen.

941
01:19:16.381 --> 01:19:18.416
Should I have Floyd serve you
up a bowl?


942
01:19:19.384 --> 01:19:21.353
You know,

943
01:19:24.389 --> 01:19:26.458
I'm gonna go with a salad.

944
01:20:46.137 --> 01:20:48.473
Can someone please help me?

945
01:21:09.194 --> 01:21:11.129
Hello?

946
01:21:12.564 --> 01:21:14.532
Is anyone there?

947
01:21:21.406 --> 01:21:23.475
Is there anybody here?
