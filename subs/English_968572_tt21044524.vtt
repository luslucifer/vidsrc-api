Come on, cut it out.

86
00:06:13.751 --> 00:06:15.335
It's not me, it's the computer.

87
00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.585
Go stand over there!

88
00:06:18.168 --> 00:06:19.918
[man] Well, I'll get the food.

89
00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:21.710
You sit here.

Oh, you're right!

97
00:06:39.126 --> 00:06:40.126
That's awesome.

98

He doesn't look so bad now.

99
00:06:43.751 --> 00:06:46.001
Oh, well, sure, whatever.

100

105
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:06.876
Sorry, nice seeing you, but Jojo and I
were just saying goodbye, so...


106
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.960
I'm working.

107
00:07:08.501 --> 00:07:09.876
What do you do?

108
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.126
[Jojo] Nothing special.
For a tour operator.


109
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.376

110
00:07:15.418 --> 00:07:17.251
Um, I'm going there to surf.

111
00:07:18.626 --> 00:07:20.126
You should join me sometime.

112
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.543
No, we have a "no surfer dude" rule.

113
00:07:24.043 --> 00:07:26.460

- [Daniel chuckles]
- Yeah.


118
00:07:33.585 --> 00:07:36.168

how people ask about work first.


119
00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:39.626
- Yeah, super funny.
- In England, they talk about the weather.


120
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.501
This is the shittiest conversation ever.
You know that?

<i>His dad died. 
Do you remember him?</i>

147
00:09:15.918 --> 00:09:19.710
That's a shame. Your parents are
both dead. I think you're soulmates.


148

<i>Man, you're full of shit.</i>

Where does he live now, your surfer boy?

150

<i>He still lives there.</i>

151
00:09:25.335 --> 00:09:27.626
[Paula] Ugh! In Shitsville, right?

152
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.293
Oh, I knew it!
He looks like that type of dude.

[Paula] Interesting.

157
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.376
Um, on another note...

158
00:09:42.418 --> 00:09:44.335
On the subject of the rent...

159
00:09:44.418 --> 00:09:45.876

In theory, I did take care of it.

[man] Ms. Peska, you know
why we canceled your payments?


181
00:10:47.335 --> 00:10:48.585
Because you're assholes?

182
00:10:48.668 --> 00:10:51.668
You violated the application requirement
several times.


183
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.251
[Paula] They were shitty jobs.

No, they were not.

I'm living off my best friend.

And so the job center is
kind of like your best friend too?


188
00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:10.543
You studied law for six years for nothing.

189
00:11:10.626 --> 00:11:12.585
Only to fuck up your final exam.

190

I do understand that you're, uh,
lacking some motivation now.

I probably would be too.

I can do for you.

You should bring her.

00:28:49.251 --> 00:28:51.293
this would appear Texas-shaped...

484
00:28:51.376 --> 00:28:52.376
[Jojo] Right.

485
00:28:52.418 --> 00:28:54.293
- [Daniel] Uh-huh? Yeah?
- [Jojo laughs]


486
00:28:54.376 --> 00:28:55.543
Awesome.

487
00:28:55.626 --> 00:28:57.085
[Daniel and Jojo laugh]

488
00:28:57.168 --> 00:28:58.501
[Jojo] Did you paint that?

489
00:28:58.585 --> 00:29:00.543
[Daniel] I painted everything myself.

490
00:29:00.626 --> 00:29:02.376
[Jojo] What will you do with these things?

491
00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:06.085
[Daniel] Um, I guess
I'll take them to my other fiancée.


492
00:29:06.168 --> 00:29:08.585
- [Daniel laughs]
- [Jojo] Don't throw it all away.


493
00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.126
- [Daniel] Come here.
- [Jojo] Hmm?


494
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:14.585
[Daniel] I'll make some space.
Then all your stuff will fit.


495
00:29:14.668 --> 00:29:16.835
[Jojo] Oh, and here? 
Is this the bathroom?

496
00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.793
- Whoa! Is it, is it?
- [Daniel] This is the bathroom.


497
00:29:20.876 --> 00:29:22.960
You can spend all your time here. Really.

498
00:29:23.043 --> 00:29:24.251
[Jojo] I believe you!

499
00:29:24.793 --> 00:29:27.585
- Wow, this is beautiful!
- [Daniel] I carved it myself.


500
00:29:28.501 --> 00:29:30.251
- [Paula sighs]
- [Daniel] That's, um...


501
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.251
[Daniel chuckles] Um, that has to...

502
00:29:33.335 --> 00:29:36.793
Wait. I'll show you more stuff.
What else do you want to see?


503
00:29:36.876 --> 00:29:39.001
I can show you
the good places to make out.


504
00:29:39.085 --> 00:29:40.960
[Jojo and Daniel laugh]

505
00:29:41.543 --> 00:29:44.751
- [Jojo] What's that?
- [Daniel] Okay, if you look out here...


506
00:29:44.835 --> 00:29:46.835
[Jojo] Oh, look, look! What is that?

507
00:29:46.918 --> 00:29:50.251
[Daniel] That's how it's supposed to look.
I'll get rid of it.


508
00:29:50.335 --> 00:29:52.293
Don't look at it, don't look at it.

509
00:29:52.376 --> 00:29:55.335
- But if you look out here, you see it?
- [Jojo] Yeah. Mm-hmm.


510
00:29:55.418 --> 00:29:56.668

[Paula sighs]

523
00:32:24.085 --> 00:32:25.501
[Paula sighs again]

524
00:32:32.085 --> 00:32:33.293
[Jojo] This is horrible.

525
00:32:34.376 --> 00:32:36.335
- [Daniel] Oh, is it now?
- [Jojo] Mm-hmm.


526
00:32:36.418 --> 00:32:37.543
[Daniel] Is it now?

527
00:32:37.626 --> 00:32:38.668
[Jojo giggling]

528
00:32:38.751 --> 00:32:40.210
[Daniel] Okay then, missus...

529
00:32:40.293 --> 00:32:41.710
But, uh, um...

530
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:46.085
- Is there still enough over there?
- [Jojo] Yeah.


531
00:32:47.085 --> 00:32:48.085
[Daniel] Okay.

532
00:32:50.543 --> 00:32:51.543
[Jojo] In both.

533
00:32:51.918 --> 00:32:52.918
[Daniel] In both.

534
00:32:56.876 --> 00:32:57.876
[Jojo giggling]

535
00:33:00.168 --> 00:33:02.085
[Jojo] It's my place too, isn't it?

536
00:33:02.835 --> 00:33:03.668
Dick!

537

[Paula sighs]

539
00:33:08.918 --> 00:33:11.376
Uh, we're going to a restaurant later.
Wanna come?


540
00:33:12.501 --> 00:33:13.626
Janosch is coming too.

541
00:33:14.751 --> 00:33:15.751
Don't know him.

542
00:33:16.585 --> 00:33:17.585
Come on.

543
00:33:18.001 --> 00:33:21.876
No. I've suppressed
all memories of this horrible island.


544
00:33:22.793 --> 00:33:25.710
He wanted to set you up,
but I said it was a terrible idea.


545
00:33:30.043 --> 00:33:31.710
[sheep bleating]

546
00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.168
[Daniel] That's where I always
used to cross the dunes.


547
00:33:35.251 --> 00:33:38.043
- [Jojo] Wow.
- [Daniel] There was a beach behind there.


548
00:33:38.126 --> 00:33:40.626
[Jojo] Hmm! You don't have to look
because of that?


549
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:43.085
[Daniel] No. I'd rather look at you.

550
00:33:43.168 --> 00:33:44.751
- [Jojo] Hmm?
- [Daniel] Mm-hmm.


551
00:33:44.835 --> 00:33:47.876
[chuckles] I don't know anyone
who still has CDs.


552
00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.085
[Daniel] Neither do I.

553
00:33:49.585 --> 00:33:51.210

[rock music playing]

555
00:34:10.168 --> 00:34:11.501
[Daniel] There's Janosch.

556
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.543
- [Janosch] So?
- [Daniel] What's up?


557
00:34:23.043 --> 00:34:25.543
- Daniel's driving. You like danger?
- [Jojo laughs]


558
00:34:25.626 --> 00:34:26.460
- You good?
- You?


559
00:34:26.543 --> 00:34:27.376
- Hey.
- Hey.


560
00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.335
[Daniel] You both remember my cousin?

561
00:34:29.835 --> 00:34:30.835
No.

562
00:34:30.918 --> 00:34:33.876
Take the road on the left.
There was a traffic jam up there.


563
00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.668
[Daniel] All right, Mr. Navigator.

564
00:34:36.168 --> 00:34:37.210
Mr. Navigator.

565
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.293
[Jojo] Well, how are you doing?

566
00:34:39.376 --> 00:34:41.001
[Janosch] Yeah, so far, so good.

567
00:34:41.085 --> 00:34:44.501
- [Daniel] Got everything done?
- [Janosch] Yeah. And you two? Excited?


568
00:34:45.085 --> 00:34:46.668
- [Jojo] Yeah...
- [Daniel] I am.


569
00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:48.043
[Janosch] Are you happy?

570
00:34:48.126 --> 00:34:49.418
[Daniel] Are we happy?

571
00:34:49.501 --> 00:34:50.501
[Jojo] Mm-hmm.

572
00:34:52.376 --> 00:34:53.418
[Janosch] Whoa!

573
00:34:53.501 --> 00:34:55.126
- Shit!

[Jojo] Wow, look at that.
That's so beautiful, isn't it?


577
00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:18.751
[Daniel] Remember our first time here,
Janosch? That was awesome.


578
00:35:18.835 --> 00:35:21.335
Come on, we've seen everything now.
We can go home.


579
00:35:22.835 --> 00:35:23.876
We found you a guy.

580
00:35:24.668 --> 00:35:25.960
So, shut up now.

581
00:35:26.043 --> 00:35:27.626
Yuck! Ugly.

582
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.585
[Daniel] Maybe you. Not me, bro.

583
00:35:31.793 --> 00:35:33.751
You should've seen the waves in Mexico.

584
00:35:34.251 --> 00:35:36.251
- [Jojo] Wait!
- You should've been there.


585
00:35:36.335 --> 00:35:37.335
- [Jojo] Hey.
- Hey.


586
00:35:37.418 --> 00:35:39.293
- [Jojo giggles]
- [Daniel] Here we are.


587
00:35:39.793 --> 00:35:42.710
[Jojo] Can you pass me the olives?
Pass me the olives.


588
00:35:42.793 --> 00:35:44.751
[Janosch] Here, here. 
Dip, dip, dip.

589
00:35:44.835 --> 00:35:46.626
- [Jojo] This is awesome.
- Want some?


590
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.168
- That one's my favorite.
- [Janosch] Kind of salty.


591
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:50.710
[Jojo] Isn't it?

592
00:35:52.418 --> 00:35:55.793
Here, do you want some cutlery?
Or are you eating with your fingers?


593
00:35:55.876 --> 00:35:58.085
Can you give me some bread? Thank you.

594
00:35:58.168 --> 00:35:59.168
Oh God!

595
00:36:00.126 --> 00:36:01.376
Are we really doing this?

596
00:36:02.043 --> 00:36:04.001
- Well, we can leave.
- [Jojo] No.


597
00:36:04.793 --> 00:36:05.793
No, definitely not.

598
00:36:08.585 --> 00:36:10.210
[Jojo chuckles]

599
00:36:10.293 --> 00:36:12.210
[murmur of conversation]

600
00:36:14.168 --> 00:36:16.210
- Ever tried these? Super delicious.
- No.


601
00:36:16.293 --> 00:36:18.335
Those are the last things I wanna try.

602
00:36:19.293 --> 00:36:20.918
- Okay. Want some?
- [Jojo] Yeah.


603
00:36:21.001 --> 00:36:22.626
- Come on.
- [Daniel] There you go.


604
00:36:23.168 --> 00:36:24.501
Oh, shit.

605
00:36:24.585 --> 00:36:25.751
Hmm?

606
00:36:25.835 --> 00:36:26.835
It's Dani's ex.

607
00:36:29.835 --> 00:36:30.835
Hi.

608
00:36:32.668 --> 00:36:34.418
Um... I...

609
00:36:34.501 --> 00:36:35.835
Your car was outside.

610
00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:38.210
Hi.

611
00:36:38.668 --> 00:36:40.793
I had no idea you were back.

612
00:36:40.876 --> 00:36:42.835
[Daniel] Um, yeah, for...

613
00:36:42.918 --> 00:36:44.126
for a few days now.

614
00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.960
Hi.

615
00:36:46.918 --> 00:36:47.960
Um, have a seat.

616
00:36:48.501 --> 00:36:51.960
Um, no, thanks. Dani, I'll go.

617
00:36:53.751 --> 00:36:56.126
Why didn't you let me know
you were coming?


618
00:36:57.001 --> 00:36:58.001
Ellin...

619
00:37:00.126 --> 00:37:01.126
I'm sorry.

620
00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:05.835
- Okay.
- [Daniel] Um...


621
00:37:05.918 --> 00:37:06.918
Sorry.

622
00:37:08.251 --> 00:37:10.251
[indistinct background chatter]

623
00:37:15.293 --> 00:37:16.293
Awkward.

624
00:37:16.835 --> 00:37:18.668
No, she wasn't awkward at all.

625
00:37:21.626 --> 00:37:24.293
[sighs] I'm pretty sure
I haven't tried this one.


626
00:37:25.835 --> 00:37:28.085
I thought she looked really sad, actually.

627
00:37:29.585 --> 00:37:30.793
[Janosch clears throat]

628
00:37:33.418 --> 00:37:35.793
- How are things with you, Paula?
- [Paula] Huh?


629
00:37:36.918 --> 00:37:39.251
- Yeah, what do you do?
- Stuff. This and that.


630
00:37:41.418 --> 00:37:43.126
[Janosch] What does that mean?

631
00:37:44.126 --> 00:37:45.710
Well, you know, just stuff.

632
00:37:45.793 --> 00:37:46.793
No, tell us.

633
00:37:51.918 --> 00:37:53.085
- I...
- [Jojo] Hmm?


634
00:37:53.168 --> 00:37:54.335
- Um...
- Yeah?


635
00:37:58.585 --> 00:37:59.626
Hmm?

636
00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:00.960
Ever heard of boundaries?

637
00:38:02.085 --> 00:38:04.793
- [Janosch] Yeah.
- He's just interested in you. Come on.


638
00:38:05.335 --> 00:38:06.668
Paula doesn't do anything.

639
00:38:08.376 --> 00:38:09.376
Hey.

640
00:38:10.001 --> 00:38:11.001
[Jojo] What?

641
00:38:12.501 --> 00:38:15.585
You started a degree,
flunked your exam, and after that, nada.


642
00:38:17.501 --> 00:38:19.626
- Really, Johanna?
- That's how it is. Admit it.


643
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:22.376
- You can't get anything done.
- [Paula] Well...


644
00:38:24.126 --> 00:38:26.960
When I think about it,
we got some fun things done.


645
00:38:27.043 --> 00:38:31.418
For example, we once made a bet
about hooking up with a different person


646
00:38:31.501 --> 00:38:32.626
every week for a year.

647
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.876
- Paula!
- So, like, 52 weeks, 52...


648
00:38:37.626 --> 00:38:39.001
Fifty-two men.

649
00:38:39.085 --> 00:38:41.835
<i>People,</i>you heteronormative
island schmuck!


650
00:38:42.418 --> 00:38:45.501
You fucked 52 people in one year?

651
00:38:45.585 --> 00:38:48.293
- [Jojo] No, we didn't do it.
- We did do it. Sure.


652
00:38:48.376 --> 00:38:51.876
- [Janosch laughs] Wow!
- [Jojo] No, it wasn't like that.


653
00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.793
[Paula] It was.

654
00:38:52.876 --> 00:38:54.960
- [Janosch] What was it like?
- Good. Really...


655
00:38:55.043 --> 00:38:56.168
[Jojo] It was nothing.

656
00:38:56.251 --> 00:38:57.626
- It was.
- [Jojo] Uh-uh.


657
00:38:58.251 --> 00:39:02.085
- And, um, what kind of people were they?
- [Paula] Good ones.


658
00:39:02.168 --> 00:39:03.543
- [Daniel] Hmm.
- Good people.


659
00:39:04.335 --> 00:39:05.793
Wanna know who won the bet?

660
00:39:05.876 --> 00:39:07.251
- No.
- [Daniel] I don't know.


661
00:39:07.335 --> 00:39:08.335
Of course.

662
00:39:16.418 --> 00:39:18.418
Do you realize how embarrassing this is?

663
00:39:21.668 --> 00:39:22.668
My phone's ringing.

664
00:39:33.585 --> 00:39:35.001
[seagulls crying]

665
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:36.710
[Jojo] Paula!

666
00:39:38.001 --> 00:39:39.001
Paula!

667
00:39:40.376 --> 00:39:41.376
Paula!

668
00:39:42.126 --> 00:39:43.043
I'm on the phone.

669
00:39:43.126 --> 00:39:44.710
No, come on, that's my trick.

670
00:39:47.501 --> 00:39:48.626
What do you want?

671
00:39:49.751 --> 00:39:51.793
Hey, are you out
of your mind or what?

672
00:39:53.043 --> 00:39:54.543
Why'd you bring that shit up?

673
00:39:55.585 --> 00:39:56.710
It was a great bet.

674
00:39:56.793 --> 00:39:58.876
In case you forgot, we
had a lot of fun.

675
00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.043
Twenty years ago.

676
00:40:00.126 --> 00:40:01.460
- Two.
- [Jojo] Paula!


677
00:40:04.293 --> 00:40:05.293
What about his ex?

678
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.335
What ex?

679
00:40:07.418 --> 00:40:10.585
- [Paula] Come on, you're not stupid.
- Yeah, what do you mean?


680
00:40:11.585 --> 00:40:13.501
You know. Something's still going on.

681
00:40:14.835 --> 00:40:16.210
Why are you doing this?

682
00:40:17.043 --> 00:40:18.918
- What?
- [Jojo] Ruining it for me.


683
00:40:20.585 --> 00:40:21.585
Uh, sorry?

684
00:40:22.876 --> 00:40:23.876
My God.

685
00:40:24.293 --> 00:40:27.626
- How can I go in there now?
- The same way you came out.


686
00:40:29.543 --> 00:40:30.543
Forget it.

687
00:40:31.126 --> 00:40:32.960
No, this is getting really pathetic.

688
00:40:36.793 --> 00:40:37.876
Can you just go now?

689
00:40:41.335 --> 00:40:42.335
Wow.

690
00:40:44.168 --> 00:40:45.168
Yeah.

- [boy] Huh?
- [Paula gasps]


699
00:44:32.043 --> 00:44:34.376
- Dude, you scared me.
- What are you doing here?


700
00:44:35.126 --> 00:44:38.126
Did you sleep here? 
Are those my clothes?

701
00:44:39.876 --> 00:44:42.085
- I'll be gone soon.
- Where are you going?


702
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:44.543
[Paula chuckles softly] You got big!

703
00:44:45.126 --> 00:44:46.585
Kids grow up. It's a miracle.

704
00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:49.960
When did you get cool?

705
00:44:51.585 --> 00:44:53.001
So, can I visit you now too?

706
00:44:54.501 --> 00:44:56.210
Sure. You can visit me anytime.

707
00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:58.376
I just had a lot to do.

708
00:44:59.543 --> 00:45:00.793
Hmm, all right.

[indistinct chatter]

When is Jojo's wedding?

711
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.835
- [Paula sighs] It's not gonna happen.
- [boy] Huh? Why not?


712
00:45:11.251 --> 00:45:12.376
She's out of her mind.

713
00:45:13.751 --> 00:45:15.376
Well, because it's all bullshit.

714
00:45:18.835 --> 00:45:19.835
[boy sighs]

715
00:45:22.418 --> 00:45:24.001
But isn't she your best friend?

716
00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.543
I bet you this wedding won't even happen.

717
00:45:28.918 --> 00:45:30.001
[boy] I don't get it.

718
00:45:30.501 --> 00:45:33.293
That's because your brain
isn't fully developed yet.


719
00:45:33.376 --> 00:45:35.168
But maybe it'll happen still.

00:45:35.835 --> 00:45:38.751
Listen, you don't have a boyfriend
or a hobby or something?


721
00:45:43.751 --> 00:45:45.418
Here. That's my boyfriend.

[both laugh]

723
00:45:48.585 --> 00:45:49.960
You're absolutely crazy.

724
00:45:52.668 --> 00:45:54.001
I need to go now.

725
00:45:54.085 --> 00:45:55.835
- I'll take you.
- [boy] No.


726
00:45:55.918 --> 00:45:57.126
Why not?

727
00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:58.835
Because I'm going with that guy.

728
00:45:59.668 --> 00:46:01.960
- That guy over there?
- [boy] Yeah, that guy.


729
00:46:02.043 --> 00:46:04.043
- [Paula] Looks nice.
- Yeah.

[guy] Hey.

731
00:46:05.501 --> 00:46:06.793
- Hi.
- Hi.


732
00:46:06.876 --> 00:46:08.543
- [Paula] Who are you?
- Jeremy. Hi.


733
00:46:08.626 --> 00:46:11.168
This is my sister.
She was just about to fuck off.


734
00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:15.251
- Yeah.
- Oh, Basti told me a lot about you.


735
00:46:15.335 --> 00:46:17.335
- Really?
- [Basti] That's not true.


736
00:46:17.418 --> 00:46:18.835
Yeah, but she believed it.

737
00:46:18.918 --> 00:46:21.210
[Basti and Jeremy laugh]

738
00:46:21.293 --> 00:46:22.960
[Jeremy] Well, uh, we have to go.

739
00:46:23.543 --> 00:46:24.876
<i>Salut,</i> sister.

740
00:46:28.168 --> 00:46:29.585
- She seemed nice.
- Yeah?

[birds chirping]

748
00:48:09.501 --> 00:48:11.835
[Jojo] I asked you
a straightforward question.


749
00:48:11.918 --> 00:48:13.518
- [Daniel] I heard you.
- [Jojo] Did you?


750
00:48:13.585 --> 00:48:15.585
[Daniel] I said everything I had to say.

751
00:48:15.668 --> 00:48:18.793
Now, why don't you tell me more
about that little bet of yours?


752
00:48:18.876 --> 00:48:20.001
How about that, huh?

753
00:48:20.085 --> 00:48:22.210
[Jojo] Come on,
you're dodging my question.


754
00:48:22.293 --> 00:48:25.043
I mentioned it, so we don't need
to talk about it now.


755
00:48:25.126 --> 00:48:28.168
I asked you a straightforward question.
Why don't you answer?


756
00:48:28.251 --> 00:48:32.168
Leave those things alone for a moment.
What is it with these avoidance tactics?


757
00:48:32.251 --> 00:48:35.710
[Jojo] You are the one avoiding stuff.
That is what's happening.


758
00:48:35.793 --> 00:48:37.668
- It's not.
- You don't have to pretend.


759
00:48:37.751 --> 00:48:40.335
- What do you mean?
- I was sitting right next to you!

[Jojo] What are you doing here?

764
00:49:14.043 --> 00:49:15.751
I just came to get my things.

765
00:49:18.085 --> 00:49:20.001
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.


766
00:49:21.001 --> 00:49:22.251
Everything's great.

767
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:34.710
What's he doing?

768
00:49:35.376 --> 00:49:36.710
[Jojo] He's going to work.

[Paula] Ah... Okay.

773
00:49:48.585 --> 00:49:51.126
Do you guys talk sometimes,
or do you just fuck?

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:53.793
- At the moment, we just fuck.

Sorry about yesterday.

You do know
I'm going ahead with this, right?

00:50:18.626 --> 00:50:19.626
[Paula] With what?

780
00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:22.460
Marriage.

781
00:50:25.126 --> 00:50:26.126
No.

782
00:50:28.001 --> 00:50:29.585
I don't think you'll marry him.

783
00:50:34.668 --> 00:50:36.376
What was that fight about earlier?

784
00:50:38.293 --> 00:50:40.626
[Jojo] Well, people fight sometimes.

785
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:45.085
Paula, no bullshitting now.

786
00:50:46.668 --> 00:50:47.793
What will you do then?

787
00:50:48.501 --> 00:50:49.501
After the wedding?

788
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:52.210
Fuck the wedding photographer?

789
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:54.876
No, I mean after that.

790
00:50:55.835 --> 00:50:57.710
With me gone and you all alone.

791
00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.376
What am I supposed to do?

792
00:51:07.751 --> 00:51:09.001
Well, I don't know.

793
00:51:14.168 --> 00:51:15.626
Just get married first.

794
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:16.710
Then we'll see.

795
00:51:24.335 --> 00:51:25.418
Okay, I have an idea.

796
00:51:28.876 --> 00:51:30.543
Let's go get you a wedding dress.

797
00:51:32.126 --> 00:51:33.126
Really?

798
00:51:33.835 --> 00:51:36.043
- [Paula] Yeah.
- [Jojo] Are you being serious?


799
00:51:36.126 --> 00:51:40.126
Yeah, of course. If you think about it

975
01:05:35.043 --> 01:05:36.085
You again.

976
01:05:38.335 --> 01:05:39.751
[Paula] What time is it?

977
01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:41.960
Almost two.

[Paula groans]

979
01:05:46.251 --> 01:05:47.835
I could sleep all the time.

980
01:05:48.918 --> 01:05:50.960
[Basti] Yeah, another form of denial.

[Paula groans]

982
01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.543
[Basti] You look like shit too.

983
01:05:54.626 --> 01:05:56.251
Who was that guy the other day?

984
01:05:57.668 --> 01:05:59.126
That's none of your business.

985
01:06:01.501 --> 01:06:03.376
[Paula] Are you in love or something?

986
01:06:04.626 --> 01:06:06.585
Oh, he's just an exchange student.

987
01:06:07.585 --> 01:06:10.460
He'll be gone soon.
I won't let my heart get broken.


988
01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:17.293
And you?

989
01:06:18.835 --> 01:06:21.543
I heard something was going on
between you and Janosch.


990
01:06:23.001 --> 01:06:24.001
[Paula] No.

991
01:06:26.335 --> 01:06:28.293
I won't let my heart get broken either.

992
01:06:34.418 --> 01:06:36.751
So, are we both
really clever or really dumb?


993
01:06:43.501 --> 01:06:45.001
- Come here.

- I was looking for you.


996
01:07:04.668 --> 01:07:07.168
Cut the bullshit.
Right in front of his ex's shop?


997
01:07:09.168 --> 01:07:10.335
[Jojo] We had a fight.

[Paula] Who?

999
01:07:12.168 --> 01:07:14.335
[Jojo] The Pope and I. Come on, Paula.

1000
01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:16.460
Why?

1001
01:07:18.085 --> 01:07:19.085
[Jojo sighs]

1002
01:07:19.876 --> 01:07:21.876
I asked him again about Ellin, and then...

1003
01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:25.376
he suddenly got kind of weird,
so I thought...


1004
01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:27.501
I'd ask her.

1005
01:07:28.918 --> 01:07:29.918
[Jojo sniffs]

1006
01:07:30.335 --> 01:07:31.335
Ask her?

1007
01:07:31.876 --> 01:07:33.335
[Jojo] I feel like shit.

1008
01:07:33.418 --> 01:07:36.251
- That's a good idea.
- [Jojo] No, it's a really shit idea.


1009
01:07:38.001 --> 01:07:40.793
I feel like I cheated on him.
I didn't even talk to her yet.


1010
01:07:43.835 --> 01:07:45.001
What's really going on?

1011
01:07:47.751 --> 01:07:48.751
I don't know.

1012
01:07:49.835 --> 01:07:50.668

since we got here.

[Jojo] We were lucky she hit a rock.

1024
01:08:57.918 --> 01:08:59.918
Just imagine all that hassle with a bib

1025

and all that shit.

Your mom jumped because she saw
no other way out of her marriage.


1033
01:09:26.376 --> 01:09:27.960
You do realize that, don't you?

I know exactly what I want.

1040
01:09:53.085 --> 01:09:54.335
Why are you crying, then?

1041
01:09:58.210 --> 01:10:00.543
Because we had a fight. 
It's no big deal.

[Paula] Who are you trying to fool?

1043
01:10:07.126 --> 01:10:10.335
Tell me, can you only be happy
when I feel like shit? Is that it?


1044
01:10:10.418 --> 01:10:12.626
Jojo, you know
that's not what this is about.

- No, thanks.

Yeah, sure. Just give
her a glass of wine.

No, I'll do it. Um...

Here. There you go.

1132

Oh!

1133
01:21:28.001 --> 01:21:30.835
- It's okay. I'll get something.
- No, just leave it there.


1134
01:21:30.918 --> 01:21:33.210
It's no problem.
Tell me where the bucket is.

where do you wanna sit?

Daniel, what's going on here?

1163
01:22:51.126 --> 01:22:55.793
I'm sorry. I wanted to talk to you,
but, um... but not now.


1164
01:22:56.668 --> 01:22:59.168
- Huh? What's going on here right now?
- [Paula] Hey.


1165
01:22:59.251 --> 01:23:03.085
What are you sorry about exactly?
The fact that she's still your girlfriend?


1166
01:23:03.168 --> 01:23:06.751
- [Daniel] What? That's not true.
- [Ellin] When did you break up with me?


1167
01:23:06.835 --> 01:23:08.668
I... I said I needed some space, so...

1168
01:23:08.751 --> 01:23:11.251
[Ellin] When you two met,
he was still with me.


1169
01:23:12.001 --> 01:23:16.918
And when you two decided to get married,
that whole time, he was still with me.


1170
01:23:17.001 --> 01:23:18.085
- And when you...
- Dude!


1171
01:23:18.168 --> 01:23:21.751
When you go to fucking Mexico and say
you need space, the message just...

01:23:21.835 --> 01:23:22.918
It's pretty clear.

1173

No.

1174
01:23:24.168 --> 01:23:26.168
You wrote to me all the time.

1175
01:23:31.168 --> 01:23:32.168
Is that true?

1176
01:23:33.710 --> 01:23:35.085
Yeah, because I...

1177
01:23:36.501 --> 01:23:39.001
um, because...
'cause you're important to me.


1178

That's interesting... too.

1181
01:23:44.835 --> 01:23:47.793
[Daniel] And because I was worried
about you, you know?


1182
01:23:47.876 --> 01:23:50.876
I want you to be okay.
I... don't want to hurt you.

Well, when?
