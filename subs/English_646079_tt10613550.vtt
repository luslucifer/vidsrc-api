1
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.300
- Do you think anyone can beat Mat Fraser?
- Yes.


2
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.940
Do you think
you could be the man to beat?


3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.660
I mean, I think anybody
can be beaten. Um...


4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.420
I'm not gonna count myself out.

5
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.740
I see it all the time,
of people saying just...


6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.980
"I'm gonna beat you, I'm
gonna..." Okay, okay, it's...


7
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.740
I'll be in Dubai.

8
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.220
One event stands
between four athletes.


9
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.460
And with one spread
across the floor,


10
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.780
welcome back to the
CrossFit Games!


11
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.300
Rumors.

12
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.580
Today, it's rumor mill time.

13
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.500
We're gonna be talking about
some potentially huge changes


14
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.940
to the 2019 CrossFit
Games season.


15
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.020
After the CrossFit
Games in 2018,


16
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.300
there were rumors
of changes coming.


17
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.236
No one quite understood
what the changes were about


18
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.700
and how it would impact them.

19
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.060
There's gonna be a change.

20
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.660
What that change is,
no one knew.


21
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.700
What's crazy is that
we have a lot of details.


22
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.836
Just kind of a general idea.

23
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.100
And people had been going nuts.

24
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.060
What really changed between

25
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.820
is the method to qualify
for the CrossFit Games.


26
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.140
In the past
a CrossFit Games season


27
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.020
was essentially three
simple stages.


28
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.460
The first stage was
the CrossFit Games Open.


29
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.860
From there the top athletes
in each region


30
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.380
would qualify through
regional stage


31
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.940
which was in a live competition
around the world.


32
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.060
Top five men, women, and teams

33
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.140
would then qualify through
the CrossFit Games.


34
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.420
Now it's much different.

35
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.580
You have multiple
options as an athlete to qualify


36
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.180
Whether it will be online
qualify in the CrossFit Open,


37
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.420
you can qualify
as a top 20 athlete,


38
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.700
or as a national champion.

39
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.020
You can also qualify through
any of the sanctional events.


40
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.220
Sanctionals replaced Regionals

41
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.580
but also added more
chances in more locations


42
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.300
for people to qualify for.

43
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.980
As an athlete you are
no longer bound to your region.


44
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.340
You can compete and
qualify to the Games


45
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.540
throughout any of these
international sanctional events.


46
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.140
After that announcement

47
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.140
that there would be
sanctioned events,


48
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.460
it was also announced that the
very first sanctioned event


49
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.140
in CrossFit Games history
was gonna be


50
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.820
The Dubai CrossFit Championship.

51
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.700
I competed at the DCC 2016,

52
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.700
and it's by far
my favorite competition.


53
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.420
It's sort of a well established
competition already.


54
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.700
I think the last two years we
had a lot of games athletes.


55
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.180
Athletes enjoy coming to Dubai because
of, obviously, the prize money.


56
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.980
But also because of the
experience they have in Dubai.


57
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.420
Every time I've been here
I had a blast.


58
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.820
The city itself, you're
just looking around


59
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.020
and everything is a spectacle here.
It's pretty wild.


60
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.540
I think this is not only
big because of the money.


61
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.460
It's also big because of amount
of big athletes that come.


62
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.420
So when you compete against
such a high caliber roster.


63
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.380
And you come on top, that
gives you bragging rights.


64
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.740
The competition
got bigger and bigger.


65
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.460
In 2017 they had Dani,
was third place at the Games.


66
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.060
They had Kara Webb,
was second place at the Games.


67
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.340
Names are always getting
bigger and bigger.


68
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.980
Unbelievable, they gonna come
and test themselves


69
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.700
amongst the best in the world.

70
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.380
It's very similar to some
of game stuff we have to do.


71
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.540
We can get outside,
we can get to the mountains,


72
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.020
we can get to the snow,
we can get to the ocean,


73
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.460
or we can be inside the gym.

74
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.260
It's almost like a mini Games.

75
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.380
I'll definitely compete
in all the sanctional events.


76
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.540
I love coming here. Also,
getting some sun in December


77
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.580
is always good.

78
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.180
It's the number of the game.

79
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.380
Oh yeah?

80
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.700
Is that a good sign?

81
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.700
Yeah, it's a redemption.

82
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.860
The atmosphere on day one
was actually really cool.


83
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.300
The setting for it
was on a beach,


84
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.220
back dropped by Burj Al Arab,

85
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.620
which is arguably
the nicest hotel


86
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.340
in one of the most
photogenic spots in Dubai.


87
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.780
The first day at the
Jumeirah Al Qasr Hotel


88
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.860
was very exciting.

89
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.300
It's a five star resort.

90
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.340
White sand, blue water.

91
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.380
I was happy 'cause
I could lie in the sun


92
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.620
in between the events.

93
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.740
- It's a lot.
- It's not like a pool.


94
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.780
- No. Not at all.
- Not like on the picture.


95
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.300
It's pretty different
than home. It's warmer.


96
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.260
At home it's like
zero - minus five degrees,


97
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.500
it's like 27 here, so.

98
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.020
This is awesome,
look at those waves.


99
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.500
It's pretty fun.

100
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.900
A little different than Iowa.

101
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.180
We swim in pool.

102
00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.220
Yes, I see this first time.

103
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.300
I never see these waves.
It's crazy.


104
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.260
Your first day swimming?

105
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.740
First day at least

106
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.980
swimming like
outside my bathtub, I guess.


107
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.220
Oh, damn.

108
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.940
Bathtubs count,
but I don't know.


109
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.260
I'm pretty experienced,
I figure it well.


110
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.700
Like time in the water,
it's always different.


111
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.300
So I was taking progressively longer
baths, kinda like an overload.


112
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.820
Like I start with 15 minutes,
nice warm bubbles,


113
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.300
and then like move to
progressively harder baths.


114
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.300
Like with less comfortable water
and kinda just longer exposure.


115
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.796
So it got to a point where I can
stay in the water for like 24 hours.


116
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.140
Since then I think I'm pretty prepared.
I got enough time in the water.


117
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.580
Some of these guys swim
like an hour a day or something.


118
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.156
I think just with amount of time I had in
comparison to them I'll be a lot more successful.


119
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.500
You got 'em at 24 hours.
Exactly, so how can I fail?


120
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.140
Do 21 reps where the
cut of those are.


121
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.820
A little early start for me.

122
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.980
I'm old now, I have to like
sleep in till eight.


123
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.500
- If I'm used to waves?
- Yeah.


124
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.260
No, there is no ocean
in Hungary whatsoever, so.


125
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.700
Have you done any ocean swim?

126
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.980
Yeah, little bit.

127
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.100
But not in this kind. These are
big waves, but I'll be okay.


128
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.300
We're wondering
if there's animals in there.


129
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.100
- Jellyfish.
- Sharks.


130
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.260
I just told some people
if you hear the bells ringing,


131
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.020
it's to keep sharks away.

132
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.380
Yellow is the shark line.

133
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.060
So sharks stay
on the other side.


134
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.740
Oh, you told the sharks:
"Hey, guys, yellow."


135
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.780
I would see a shark,
I would just hit him.


136
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.300
There's no sharks here.

137
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.660
I feel like this swimsuit
is so badass.


138
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.380
You know, like a superhero
costume, a little bit.


139
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.860
Maybe not!

140
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.460
Intimidating the bad guys.

141
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.580
- Oh my God, Kristof.
- Of course no bad guys here.


142
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.740
When the athletes started to see

143
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.340
we were anchoring buoys
out in water


144
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.460
they started to realize
the water was a lot more


145
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.980
difficult than we had expected.

146
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.140
It felt like I was in
a surf event or something.


147
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.860
The setup was so cool, and
the waves were massive.


148
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.900
We had the beach
for ourselves and I said:


149
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.100
"How cool is it to start
a competition on a beach?"


150
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.460
It's 2159.

151
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.020
Double kettlebell snatch.

152
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.260
Double kettlebell front squat.

153
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.580
Followed by a 350 meter swim.

154
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.500
First thought was to jack
your heart rate up real high


155
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.940
with kettlebells, and
then you gotta get in the water


156
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.100
with the high heart rate.
We'll see who's ready for that.


157
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.860
An athlete we saw pull out
of competition


158
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.340
at the Games last year
is back in competition.


159
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.140
Sara Sigmundsdottir
will be in lane number six.


160
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.340
I'm really shocked
that he still has a shirt on.


161
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.500
Okay, there we go.

162
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.740
We haven't really been
talking a lot about Sara lately.


163
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.540
We've been
talking about Laura lately.


164
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.420
That first bit with
kettlebells, just get through it


165
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.300
and then it was just try not to
drown in the water.


166
00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.580
Not always the biggest
waves in Dubai,


167
00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.220
and they were
pretty big that day.


168
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.340
I've never seen
the ocean like that.


169
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.076
In these two years I been here
until that day.


170
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.820
That changed the event a lot.

171
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:09.580
If you're comfortable
swimming in flat water.


172
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.100
It's complete change.

173
00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.780
I've never seen waves that big.

174
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.060
We swam a lot leading up to DCC.

175
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.100
But never,
not even half the size.


176
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.340
People were just getting
destroyed by it.


177
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.580
There was a point
where I thought to myself:


178
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.820
"How do we track
those ten people in the water?


179
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.220
Like how do we know
someone didn't go under?"


180
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.340
Sigmundsdottir
has her feet on the ground.


181
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.260
It's cool to use
your fitness in something


182
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.220
that's just in the nature.

183
00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.740
Like you mix fitness
with kettlebells,


184
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.820
and then you have to
be like pure nature,


185
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.860
and it's pretty cool.

186
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.300
Foot race
between Briggs and Green,


187
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.620
and depending on who
gets to the mat first,


188
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.220
it looks like Briggs
will take it!


189
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.340
Did you see me
on the way back there?


190
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.140
Like the three waves
that crushed me.


191
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.740
I thought: "Stay cool."
Then another one.


192
00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.340
- It was so hard.
- Yeah?


193
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.620
It was so hard.

194
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.420
I've never swim in waves before.

195
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.140
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.


196
00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.220
So this was the first time.

197
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.380
They told me not to get
panicked, so I stayed calm.


198
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.580
- It's the best thing, just relax in water.
- Yeah.


199
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.740
- Well done.
- Thank you.


200
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.500
Now I know I don't have
any glasses for next event.


201
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.740
Two back to back swimming events

202
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.500
is a cool wrench
to throw at them.


203
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.900
And they're always
worried about,


204
00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.580
OK, we got the first one
out of the way.


205
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.780
Okay, you just got
your teeth kicked in


206
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.100
and now we're gonna do it again.

207
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.020
Initially, the athletes
thought they just had to


208
00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.060
go for a traditional swim
in event number two,


209
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.060
once they're done
with the runner.


210
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.340
But then at the last minute,
they threw in a kind of a twist


211
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.660
where they would have to
take what's commonly known as


212
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.220
a lifeguard buoy
into the water with them.


213
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.580
They would have to keep it
with them when they swim.


214
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.780
Those buoys have a strap

215
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.740
and it was a game time
decision to cut the strap.


216
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.220
Oh, that's going
to be a learning curve


217
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.060
for a lot of people
really quick.


218
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.820
We didn't know about that
we're gonna have to carry it


219
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.460
until right before the event.

220
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.660
So nobody really knew
like how to use it,


221
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.900
or like what's the best
technique was gonna be.


222
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.180
Yeah, that was a lot
more difficult than it looked.


223
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.740
I love the waves.

224
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.060
But not when I have
a life buoy thing with me.


225
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.700
That took my soul away.

226
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.860
Thought I was a good swimmer,
until I had the buoy


227
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.740
I was like:
"buoy will help me to be


228
00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:50.820
even a better swimmer."

229
00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.220
But then it just messed it up.

230
00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.940
You'd almost
think it's maybe easier,


231
00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.660
'cause you've got something
to like float with,


232
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.340
but that thing
was very slippery,


233
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.620
so I think a few people
lost it out there


234
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.020
and then had to
come running to shore to get it.


235
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.356
I felt like I looked like David
Hasselhoff there for a minute.


236
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.980
You know, just grabbing the buoy
and taking off.


237
00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.780
Then I looked like a wet noodle
when I lost it at the end.


238
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.540
The wave just came over, crashed
and the thing just took off.


239
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.956
It's one of those things when
sometimes athletes are forced to adapt.


240
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.300
Some do that really well and some
don't and the ones that don't,


241
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.420
you'll certainly gonna
hear about it.


242
00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.340
And now it
looks like a foot race


243
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:37.460
-between Mat Fraser and Streat Hoerner.
- And my buoy just slipped.


244
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.700
- And Hoerner will lose his buoy!
- Like, aw, no!


245
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:45.180
Fraser will get across
the finish line about 10:13.


246
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.580
I swallowed so much water!

247
00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.540
I love the ocean and
I love the sun,


248
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.780
in Iceland you don't
get that much beach.


249
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.940
So I was very happy to
start the day there.


250
00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.100
I love the beach.
Probably favorite place to be.


251
00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.140
So it was a very good
first day of competition.


252
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.820
It was probably one of
the best first days


253
00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.100
in a competition I've ever had.

254
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.020
That is a wrap of day one

255
00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.140
of the Dubai CrossFit
Championship 2018.


256
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.300
We've spent a gorgeous day
here on the beach.


257
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.540
We're gonna be
in the desert tomorrow,


258
00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.540
and then in the tennis stadium for
the final two days of competition.


259
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.540
Keep it here
for all the details.


260
00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.980
- Sara, how's Fiona? - She's a
princess now. She survived the run.


261
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.780
- You came up with the nickname Fiona?
- -Yeah.


262
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.500
Fun fact.

263
00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.860
Sara's toe
is named by Sam Briggs.


264
00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:15.180
Princess Fiona, because
she wants to be beautiful,


265
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.620
but she's just an ogre.

266
00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.780
I accepted
that my toe is very ugly.


267
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.580
So, we've told the athletes to consider
getting gaiters for their shoes.


268
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.820
Lot of people didn't know what the gaiters
were, so I think they looked it up.


269
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.820
They bought gaiters,
and came to Dubai.


270
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.836
And I think that's the first
time they opened the gaiters.


271
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.316
They didn't realize that you have
to get them sewn to your shoes


272
00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.100
for them to really, really work.

273
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.580
- Gaiters.
- They go over what?


274
00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.340
They go over your shoe.

275
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.060
I just don't know which way.

276
00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.860
Aw, it doesn't go on
my big fat shoe.


277
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.300
So day one you had
two water events,


278
00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.100
back to back, on the beach.

279
00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.620
And now things are about
to take a complete 180.


280
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.420
When you move on to
day number two,


281
00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.500
you go out to the desert
for a long run.


282
00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.300
Four kilometers out,
four kilometers back.


283
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.820
They're good runners.

284
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.300
Behind that, it's whoever

285
00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.940
is the fittest will do well.

286
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.460
The first 4K will be done
with a tactical vest on.


287
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.260
20 pounds for the men,

288
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.300
Three, two, one, go!

289
00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.140
I just heard so many bad things

290
00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.820
about how hard it is
to run in the desert.


291
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.820
Running with a weighted
vest for me


292
00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.980
is hard before and being
in sand is even harder.


293
00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.540
Well, I knew from last year

294
00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.180
we had to do a desert run.

295
00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.060
And it was one of the worst
things I'd ever done.


296
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.540
So yeah, I knew it was
going to be really hard.


297
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.420
The thing about this
is this is an event


298
00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.340
you wouldn't traditionally
see basically anywhere else.


299
00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.260
Most events don't have
access to a massive desert,


300
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.700
or a beach long enough
to do something similar to this,


301
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.620
so it's an event where sure,
athletes are used to running,


302
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.500
but the slight nuance
and difference


303
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.300
were you have to
run in a soft sand


304
00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.020
is really a test that
they're not used to.


305
00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.700
Mikaela Norman has come
to the halfway point


306
00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.260
verse with Sam Briggs

307
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.420
about 10 seconds behind her.

308
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.900
A lot of people wore
gaiters over the shoes


309
00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.980
to keep the sand out,
that worked.


310
00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.220
A lot of people didn't.

311
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.980
So I think a lot
of them ended up


312
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.300
having to take their shoes off,

313
00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.460
and just run barefoot
in the sand.


314
00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.220
I actually was thinking
about taking mine off


315
00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.820
'cause I had so much sand.

316
00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.660
They just filled.

317
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.340
Like the front of my toes
were just thick with sand.


318
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.060
You can just
see the elevation changes


319
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.140
along the run course.

320
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.860
All false summits, right?

321
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.420
Because you get
to the top of a dune,


322
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.996
and you think that's
the top of the dune,


323
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.260
and then it just goes
further out and up again.


324
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.620
And that's pretty heartbreaking.

325
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.220
Mikaela Norman will take

326
00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.660
Women's Event number three.

327
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.220
Brendan Willis has opened
up a substantial lead


328
00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.620
between him and second
place, Roman Khrennikov.


329
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.980
And one thing we know
is that Mat Fraser


330
00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.060
does have some wheels on him.

331
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.900
Trying to sneak up on
Bjorgvin Karl Gudmundsson,


332
00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.820
but it looks like too
little, too late.


333
00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:11.660
It was the battle of the
elements out here in the desert.


334
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.220
A lot of things making it
tougher for the athletes


335
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.620
than a normal 8K run.

336
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.180
I'm just so glad it's over.

337
00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.980
It feels like never ending.

338
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.700
Up and down.

339
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:26.700
You can't really like imagine
how it is to run.


340
00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.380
You have to run to know it.

341
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.900
I ditched my shoes about

342
00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.460
It was much better
without shoes.


343
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.020
Way better without shoes.

344
00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.100
Freaking Fred Flintstone
over here.


345
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.940
That was much more
difficult than I was expecting.


346
00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.540
So soft.

347
00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.500
You want to run where there
haven't been footprints,


348
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.660
so there's like that
crust on top.


349
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.020
Even that.

350
00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.180
Like out of every ten steps,
you maybe get one firm one.


351
00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.540
- Not so great.
- Not so good?


352
00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.340
My back blew up.

353
00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.860
I don't know, I bogged
more than ran.


354
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.900
Is that where Sour Patch
Kids come from?


355
00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.100
You know what I mean?

356
00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.380
Like what is that?

357
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.340
So things will shift now
as we go into event four,


358
00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.460
and we move into the
tennis stadium.


359
00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.060
A few big names
on the women's side


360
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.620
had questions about
some potential injuries


361
00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.140
coming into the weekend.

362
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.540
Laura Horvath,
unbeknownst to a lot of people


363
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.380
had been dealing with
a back injury.


364
00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.500
And it kinda bothered her
leading up to the competition.


365
00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.620
Do you feel more pressure

366
00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.060
because of what happened
at the Games last year?


367
00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.100
I don't know, probably. I mean,
I try not to think about it,


368
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.900
but everyone's talking about it,

369
00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.820
so it's kind of hard
to like not think about it.


370
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.380
Everybody's like:
"She finished second,


371
00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.100
she should not made it here."

372
00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.820
I mean, it is what it is.

373
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.220
It's December, so I'm trying
to qualify for the Games,


374
00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.900
which is in August,
so I'll be fine.


375
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.340
I broke my rib November, 2017.

376
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.140
I had it broken from the Games,

377
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.180
and I knew that it was
broken in November.


378
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.580
My mindset at that time was
just I'm back at the beginning.


379
00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.420
It's so hard to have been here,

380
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:33.020
and like almost winning
the Games into like,


381
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.900
will I qualify for Regionals?

382
00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.980
And then first day at the
Games, I break my rib again.


383
00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:42.260
And it's like... I said it
to my coach the week before,


384
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:46.220
the worst thing that can happen is that I
break my rib. And we were joking about it,


385
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.940
because we knew it wouldn't
happen, and then it happened.


386
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.540
And I competed at World's
after that in November.


387
00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.380
I had only been
training for about


388
00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.380
two weeks before World's

389
00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.860
in Olympic weightlifting,
so after November


390
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.460
I had four weeks to train more,

391
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.020
and I was just excited to see

392
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.580
what I could do in
a competition.


393
00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.220
I think women's side
is gonna be interesting.


394
00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.940
'Cause everyone
sitting at the top


395
00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.500
does not have real big number,

396
00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.380
and the first thing
we do is snatch, heavy.


397
00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.940
So, Samantha Briggs
it's damage control.


398
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.260
Jamie Green, it's gonna be
a kind of damage control.


399
00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.100
Stronger girls will
get the chance


400
00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.140
to really jump back up
the leaderboard


401
00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.300
when we get into those more
classic CrossFit style workouts.


402
00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:29.580
We've seen Laura come out,
not do very well,


403
00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.460
and then smash in event,
smash in event, smash in event.


404
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.100
And I think there's a lot
that can be made up there.


405
00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.740
She's never had pressure on her.

406
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.420
Now there's kind of
the expectation,


407
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.940
and that's a lot of pressure.

408
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.700
Jamie Green as far as
on competitive steam,


409
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.780
and she won this event in 2015

410
00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.900
when no one had really
ever heard of her,


411
00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.300
and then she came back
next year and won the open.


412
00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.540
I think she's got an
incredible shot.


413
00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:56.100
Stunner, mate, that's what
she is. She's a stunner.


414
00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.540
I'm happy with how the
last two days have gone.


415
00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.980
Obviously, this is not going
to be my strongest event,


416
00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:07.340
but hopefully shouldn't do like
too bad on the next two events,


417
00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:13.540
and then it'll make it interesting on
the final day. Everything to play for.


418
00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.580
I mean I think it's
a good start, after two days.


419
00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.860
First workout, I wanted to
do a little better.


420
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.500
Because a little too
conservative on the first one,


421
00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.340
but then the other
workouts we've had,


422
00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:24.860
I guess
we've had two other ones,


423
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.500
I felt like
I capitalized pretty well.


424
00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.540
I'm pretty happy with
where I'm sitting.


425
00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.420
I mean, it's like seven
points out of first.


426
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.220
There's still
seven events to go,


427
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.340
so it's a lot left,
but I like my chances right now.


428
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.260
Travis Mayer, Willy Georges,

429
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.860
and Bjorgvin Karl Gudmundsson.

430
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.980
Those guys that can push Mat
for the weekend.


431
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.580
This is the day where
Mat reminds everybody


432
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.540
of who Mat Fraser is.

433
00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.900
They're gonna have to
be perfect to beat Mat.


434
00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.020
Everyone comes to the snatch
event, everybody wants to watch it.


435
00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.780
And it's just like going to, to a baseball
game, it's like you want to see a home run.


436
00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.820
Like you don't want to see
singles and doubles or triples.


437
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.260
You go to see home runs, and
that's what this snatch event is.


438
00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.700
It will be a
one rep max snatch event,


439
00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.740
but a little twist is that
we've kind of seen all weekend


440
00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:20.620
is that there's only
five minutes allotted


441
00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.660
for them to get that
one rep max.


442
00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.020
Everyone loves
a lifting workout.


443
00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.900
It's like a lot of
hype behind it.


444
00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.660
Very entertaining
for the crowds.


445
00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.700
You use that adrenaline
with everybody,


446
00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.020
and it just gives you so much.

447
00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:36.460
I have a number in my
head that I want to hit,


448
00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.500
so I surprised myself by
hitting almost six kilos heavier


449
00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.060
than I'm hitting in World's.

450
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.860
So I was very happy
with that event.


451
00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.940
136 good for Jason Smith.

452
00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.580
Everyone wants to see
a very heavy lift.


453
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.540
It doesn't matter
if you do it at your gym.


454
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.780
Can you do it when
people are watching?


455
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.980
Can you do it when
it can cost the event?


456
00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:10.020
Mia Akerlund going for
a PR attempt of 104 kilo.


457
00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.460
- Oh, wow!
- -Mia Akerlund has set the snatch record


458
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.700
in live CrossFit competition!

459
00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.500
The bigger sharks
are starting to come up


460
00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.220
and start swimming.

461
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.140
I had 136 loaded, and I knew
that was the top weight,


462
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.180
so I knew it would
get me a 100 points.


463
00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.300
But it would also
give the other two guys


464
00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.700
who hit 136 a 100 points.

465
00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.980
So I wanted to throw
on one extra kilo.


466
00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.660
40 seconds to go.

467
00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.020
- Oh, wow!
- -But that's good for Mat Fraser!


468
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.460
So 137 for Mat Fraser

469
00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.780
and a much needed confidence
boost for Laura Horvath.


470
00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:57.620
Make no doubt about it.
She needed that place finishing.


471
00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.420
I just beat our max snatch.

472
00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:03.620
I got 93 kilos.
I'm pretty happy.


473
00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.860
I had 136 loaded
and then I was like,


474
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.460
nah, I was like, Jason's good,

475
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.420
I need to take points away
from him.


476
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.340
Shit, man. Well done, dude.

477
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.740
The thing about Mat beating you
is like you can't be mad at it.


478
00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:17.220
Do you know what I'm saying?

479
00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.300
If you get beat by him,
well, he beat you


480
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.020
and you're like yeah,
well, okay.


481
00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.620
What you gonna do? Try again.

482
00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.620
Yeah, it's the first time
I go over like 85 since...


483
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.700
Since 1960...

484
00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.460
Yeah, it's also as like
why didn't I put more on?


485
00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.740
Yeah, and a little bit
like on to the side.


486
00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.220
Yeah, it's very weird.

487
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.380
I've never felt
anything like that before.


488
00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.860
Reach down, touch your toes
as fast as you can.


489
00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.180
How's that one feel?

490
00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.740
- Yeah, it hurts.
- That's good?


491
00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.500
Get you on your back, face up.

492
00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.420
I don't know, my back hurts
so... I mean, I don't know.


493
00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.500
Like yeah, from yesterday.

494
00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.620
I just... I can't bend over,
it hurts so much.


495
00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.180
I don't know how I snatched...

496
00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.780
- You got hurt now?
- Yeah.


497
00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.940
Before and after even,
but it's not happening.


498
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:05.420
I know you moved on and you like
coaching like this, but do you miss this?


499
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.860
No, I miss, like this is the
only event that I'm like,


500
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.620
oh, I kind of miss this,

501
00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:15.220
but watching people run
in the desert yesterday


502
00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.340
made me realize why I stopped.

503
00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.380
Know where you are
in the competition right now?


504
00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.940
I think that last event
bumped me up to first.


505
00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:29.380
You know, it's still a tight race
for like the top five or six,


506
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:33.900
but, coming into today,
I think the top three of us


507
00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.060
were separated by five points.

508
00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.260
And then I think it was
like through the top eight


509
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.540
was still a narrow
points spread.


510
00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:44.660
Event five was
a 20 meter yoke carry,


511
00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.820
straight into a 15 parallel
handstand push-ups,


512
00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:51.700
and then three rounds
of 15 box jump overs,


513
00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.900
and 10 ring muscle ups,
and then you finish


514
00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.700
with a 20 meter yoke
carry again.


515
00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.180
I suggest the first round to be

516
00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.940
a little slower on the box.

517
00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.340
Put on the rings and
then after that


518
00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.860
you get onto the box and
then you can speed up,


519
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.300
or slow down based on how
you feel on the rings.


520
00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.060
It's gonna be
a little bit slower


521
00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.780
on the handstand push-ups
compared to the other girls.


522
00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.020
She could speed up after that.

523
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.380
The yoke's heavy.

524
00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.820
It's going to slow a few
of the lighter girls down


525
00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.340
who will move faster in the
middle bit.


526
00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:31.180
So it's going to be like a
pretty good rest, I think.


527
00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.580
So I'd help my girls put the
right height for the yoke,


528
00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.340
and then I remembered,
oh my gosh,


529
00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.340
I have parallel
handstand push-ups too.


530
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.100
So I ran to fix
handstand push-ups


531
00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.780
and then it's like three...

532
00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.700
two, one, go!

533
00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:49.820
I was like, oh no!

534
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.060
Please don't make me disqualify!

535
00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.140
Laura Horvath,

536
00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.860
who's moved up into fifth place,

537
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.140
made very easy work
of that yoke!


538
00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.340
The thing with Laura is this particular
event has specialties for her,


539
00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.500
and some kryptonite for her.

540
00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.660
The Achilles heel,
and you just saw


541
00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.620
that first rep was a strain.

542
00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.940
That's one, she's got 14.

543
00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.020
I don't think
it's a family curse,


544
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:22.940
the handstand push-ups, but
it doesn't go well for us.


545
00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:31.780
There's a lot of people talking to Laura.
She has her brother, she has her coach


546
00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.900
and several other people throughout
the weekend having a say.


547
00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.300
Plus her own voice, right?

548
00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.300
Sigmundsdottir
is in second place.


549
00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.580
About five reps behind
Jamie Green.


550
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:53.980
Jamie Green who is third
overall after four events


551
00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:57.580
is running her way across
the competition floor.


552
00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.180
Fraser will
take event number five!


553
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.740
And for Laura Horvath,

554
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.940
her chances of making it
back at least to the podium,


555
00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.340
are all but gone.

556
00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:18.540
- Laura, how'd it go?
- Not good.


557
00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.620
I know my handstand
push-ups are not great,


558
00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.940
but I just did shitty.

559
00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.540
I didn't do my
handstand push-ups.


560
00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.060
It's a pretty
significant hole for Laura.


561
00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.300
She finished second at
the Games last year,


562
00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.780
so she's in the conversation

563
00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.660
to be a contender
this year again,


564
00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.180
but for the most part, if you
want to win the CrossFit Games,


565
00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.860
you can't have a hole like that.

566
00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.940
You have to be pretty
well rounded


567
00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.500
in just about every
aspect of fitness.


568
00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.940
I don't know how to put it.

569
00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.580
I've worked so much on that.

570
00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.380
I'm just not perfect.

571
00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:55.380
So for Laura, it's something
that's been a weakness


572
00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:56.940
in the past, still
a weakness now.


573
00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.860
She's gonna have to dedicate
the next few years


574
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.900
of development as kind of
shoring up that hole as well.


575
00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:06.380
So me, a fast row is like 155.

576
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.260
That's a really fast row for me.

577
00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.860
And I remember watching Laura
doing full bare bond,


578
00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.900
and she was rowing my best row,

579
00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.340
and she's like rowing that for
like an hour.


580
00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.820
I couldn't believe it.

581
00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.540
I think she's pissed that
I think she did it.


582
00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.300
Did everything she
can to go fast.


583
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.780
So event six was Acid Bath.

584
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.380
Which is now a very well
known workout in CrossFit.


585
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.980
Pain.

586
00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.780
Just pain, it's gonna
hurt so bad.


587
00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.980
Acid Bath is probably the most

588
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.620
appropriately named event
of the weekend.


589
00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.100
This is how much
pain can you take


590
00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.620
and it's just straight
grunt work.


591
00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.740
Once again, Karin Frey.

592
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.380
We'll keep saying this name.

593
00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:55.380
And Jamie Green has moved
into first place


594
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.860
over Samantha Briggs
by just four points.


595
00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.860
A name that we do not
see on the top 10


596
00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.380
of the leaderboard
is Laura Horvath.


597
00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:10.900
Each one of the distances
on these concept two machines


598
00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:13.460
is just short enough to
where you can give it


599
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.580
basically a full effort.

600
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:19.780
That event is as much
mental as it is physical.


601
00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.500
You know how bad
it's gonna hurt,


602
00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.180
you know how bad
you have to push


603
00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.340
if you want to have
a good finish on that, so yeah,


604
00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.900
you get into the thick
of things, and it's rough.


605
00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:32.620
Your lungs start to burn a little bit,
your muscles start to burn a little bit,


606
00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:36.300
And before you know it,
you've got this lactic acid burn


607
00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.020
throughout your entire body.

608
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:41.660
I think more of time
it's like 80% mental.


609
00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.260
Especially like when you
get to those top athletes.


610
00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.900
Like everyone trains similar.

611
00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.860
Everyone does long
hours in the gym.


612
00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.780
They have similar skill sets,
but as


613
00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.300
was those who
can pull it out on the game day.


614
00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.620
Fraser has one left,

615
00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.660
but it's gonna be
Khrennikov in lane 10!


616
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.900
Everything in your body hurts,

617
00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:17.420
and you can hardly even
walk to the finish line.


618
00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:20.060
I've never experienced
anything like that.


619
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.940
My legs, literally,
I couldn't even pick them up.


620
00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.020
It was a bear crawl
to the finish line.


621
00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.780
Laura Horvath blasting

622
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.220
the best time by 17 seconds!

623
00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:48.700
Someone get water.

624
00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.420
Everyone was dead after that.

625
00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.980
Yeah.

626
00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.300
I had somebody
help me off the floor.


627
00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:59.220
Like, that's not something
I want people to see.


628
00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:02.500
I literally could not
walk off the floor.


629
00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.420
That's how bad it was.

630
00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.580
And then it just got worse.

631
00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.380
I mean, guys were just
laying in the tunnel


632
00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:12.700
after five, ten minutes after
the workout not able to move.


633
00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:18.140
I think everyone was dead after
that except for Laura. She was fine.


634
00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.860
- You okay, hun?
- No.


635
00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.500
Laura comes in,
crushes this event,


636
00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.300
and then you see the men
can't even walk.


637
00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.220
And she's kinda just strolling
off the competition floor,


638
00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.700
so you know there's some
mental toughness there.


639
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.140
Hi!

640
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:49.220
Yes! We got our picture with
Laura!


641
00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.300
We were like 100 meters
into the ski.


642
00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.220
I was like Khrennikov, plus 12,

643
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.140
and I was like, "what?"

644
00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.980
- He's going 10% faster?
- Yeah.


645
00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.780
- I could tell my legs hurt.
- Yeah.


646
00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:03.900
But it was just like
I couldn't feel it.


647
00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.180
As soon as I stopped.

648
00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:09.060
Yep, it all came.

649
00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:11.380
Ah, my lungs.

650
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.900
You gonna be a master next year.

651
00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.940
- 34.
- Not doing bad for an old man.


652
00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:22.460
- And you?
- 28. I'm dead serious.


653
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.100
- I thought yo were.
- Come on man, you're really old.


654
00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.420
I mean, you're like
masters next year.


655
00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.540
I have another seven years
of that.


656
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.100
Look how much better I
could get in seven years.


657
00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.820
Like you're already at your
peak, like you're there.


658
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.940
Shit, seven years.

659
00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:42.980
Seven years.

660
00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.820
The only time I've
ever felt like that,


661
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.340
or seen anything like that
after a workout,


662
00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:55.100
was at the Games,
it was '14, right?


663
00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.100
With the sled push?

664
00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:00.660
And it was like people
just couldn't stand up.


665
00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.620
It was like one
of those things like


666
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.180
the way I used to workout
finishes is when the pain starts.


667
00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.780
Oh, that was awful.

668
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.900
Did you just straight bear
crawl across the finish line?


669
00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.340
I almost had to as well.

670
00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:15.900
I can't even imagine.

671
00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.780
Like at that point
it's just like...


672
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:19.220
Survival mode.

673
00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.100
- Whatever you got to do.
- Yeah.


674
00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:23.340
Today was tough.

675
00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.940
That last workout was
just mean, it was...


676
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.300
No, like there was never
a day of like,


677
00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.100
I'm gonna beat so and so,

678
00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:38.340
like me going on camera
and talking about it.


679
00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:41.220
There was like, I set
a goal internally,


680
00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.060
and then it worked.

681
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:47.940
And it's like, if you have
something worth bragging about,


682
00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.340
you don't have to.

683
00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.180
You don't have to
brag for yourself.


684
00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.380
If you have something worth
actually bragging about,


685
00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.300
other people will do it for you.

686
00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.060
So coming into the final day,

687
00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.740
we got news that Laura Horvath

688
00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.420
was pulling out of the
competition, withdrawing.


689
00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.780
What's going on with Laura?

690
00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.860
She's at the doctor's now,

691
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.340
getting her back checked out.

692
00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:30.980
It's early in the season.

693
00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:33.700
Not a good time
to be taking any chances.


694
00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.620
My back blew up after the run.

695
00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:38.220
And I mean during the run.

696
00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.300
And I thought I was
gonna be okay,


697
00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:43.100
and I'm not so good right now.

698
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.940
That's a difficult
decision to make


699
00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.580
for a lot of these athletes.

700
00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:48.140
They are training year round

701
00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.700
for these very specific
moments of competition


702
00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.740
to where it very
much feels like,


703
00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.100
you know, the totality
of their world


704
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.300
is in front of them
at this competition.


705
00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.860
To be able to acknowledge that

706
00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.540
hey, this competition is
over for me


707
00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:02.476
and I need to do what's best
and I need to pull out,


708
00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.700
is something that
they're not very used to.


709
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:08.260
How were you able to get through
the pain and win last night?


710
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:12.300
I don't know. I just...
I don't know.


711
00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:15.820
In the rope area it was painful
just yanking onto rope,


712
00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:19.660
but I just like
I wanted to do the event.


713
00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.820
After did not finishing
the previous event,


714
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:27.780
I wanted to win this, so I
just worked through the pain.


715
00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.940
These are basically superhumans.

716
00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.820
They are physically
capable of things


717
00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.340
that no other people
on the planet are capable of.


718
00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.700
And so to kind of bring
yourself back down to Earth,


719
00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:38.700
and have to acknowledge
that something


720
00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.780
as devastating as an injury is
gonna force you to withdraw,


721
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.620
it's a tough decision to make.

722
00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.460
I've never withdraw from,

723
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.660
like pull out from
a competition ever,


724
00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.460
so it's a bad feeling,
it's like...


725
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.300
I don't want that to
happen to anyone


726
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.740
because it's like,
not good emotionally


727
00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:59.060
and physically it's not, yeah.

728
00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.620
It's the worst thing you have to do
when you have to stop a competition.


729
00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:04.260
Like you worked hard for it,

730
00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.260
and then you have
to stop midway...


731
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.900
It's... you feel like all your
work is gone to waste.


732
00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.580
I was upset,
like gutted for her.


733
00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.380
'Cause I know what
that feels like.


734
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.220
It sucks when
you're halfway through


735
00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.796
and you gotta stop
because of an injury,


736
00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.620
but there's the good thing
with the new system


737
00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:21.020
that she can take
a rest, recover,


738
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.820
and then come back in a few
months to another competition.


739
00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.140
How're you feeling
on the last day going into it?


740
00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.940
Feeling good.

741
00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.300
Pretty much the same
amount of points open up


742
00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.540
the last four days...

743
00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.580
- Uh-huh.
- or three days.


744
00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:39.460
Just going to try and
capitalize on all the events.


745
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.780
Blast them, hopefully
close the gap.


746
00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.300
And, I mean, anything
can still happen.


747
00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.900
That's one thing
I've always been good at,


748
00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:49.460
is just let it go and
just keep moving on,


749
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:53.180
and always try to see
what can come at the end.


750
00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.940
I've done it a few
times at Regionals,


751
00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.220
to get into the Games.

752
00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.340
So hopefully I can
pull it off here.


753
00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.820
Last day of the competition.

754
00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.580
It's gonna feel good.

755
00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.740
It's going good.

756
00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.180
What's your hopes
for the weekend?


757
00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.980
- Being top 10.
- Top 10?


758
00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.620
Yeah, top 10 was the goal
when we came here.


759
00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:17.540
- Now what is?
- But now is top three.


760
00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.660
The leaderboard
is starting to take shape.


761
00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.380
On the women's side,
Sam Briggs, still alive


762
00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:28.380
and in charge, with a 34
point lead over Jamie Green.


763
00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.980
Sara Sigmundsdottir has
moved into third,


764
00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:34.380
but a name we probably
don't know very well,


765
00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:37.780
is Karin Frey who's
sitting in fourth place


766
00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:39.860
in striking distance
and after a day


767
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.180
that we have four scored events.

768
00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.740
Event number seven is under way

769
00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.340
as athletes spread across
the competition floor


770
00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.180
to tackle nine rope lines.

771
00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.580
This is the final day
of competition,


772
00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:59.540
with four totaled events.

773
00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.180
Now this is great!

774
00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.540
Fact that Mat's able
to kinda lead the pack,


775
00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.476
just like you said, these guys are
going to need to take some chances


776
00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.140
and I think they may be

777
00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.420
overextending themselves
by trying to follow Mat.


778
00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:13.300
So there's leading the pack and
then there is drawing pack out.


779
00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.940
I feel like Fraser
does a good job


780
00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:18.420
of dictating the pace
against other athletes.


781
00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:35.660
Mat plants
the flag in event number seven,


782
00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.380
and gets another event win
this weekend.


783
00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.900
And then Jamie Green,
if she can hold on,


784
00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:45.380
may be able to push herself
just ahead of Akerlund


785
00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:48.540
by one spot, and she will!

786
00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:58.020
So coming into the last day,
the women's side of the house


787
00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:00.420
was really, really
tight points wise.


788
00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.660
And there was four to five women

789
00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.620
that were realistically
within a shot of potentially


790
00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.420
walking away with a win.

791
00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:09.060
Nobody's gonna know, like...

792
00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:12.700
Anything can happen,
it's so close.


793
00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.700
But for the men's side
it was the opposite.


794
00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.660
Mat Fraser was
starting to run away with it.


795
00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.540
He had multiple event wins.

796
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.860
He was starting to tie
more of them together,


797
00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.940
It looked like it was
his competition.


798
00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:26.100
The goal coming in,
I think, my mindset was to win.


799
00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.300
But then throughout the
competition, things changed.


800
00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.860
There's still 300 points
up for grabs.


801
00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.340
Which is a lot of points,
anything could happen,


802
00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.380
so I'm just right
outside of third,


803
00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:38.580
so hopefully now it's
just to get on the podium


804
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:39.980
and make some more money.

805
00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.140
Diaper and milk money,
is all that is.


806
00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.500
What's the next workout?

807
00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.940
Sandbag carry,
burpee box jump-over,


808
00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.980
carry assault bike,
and then back.


809
00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.700
It's the workout of death.
It's only gonna be...


810
00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:59.300
It's a three minute time cap, so you'll
be going full blast for the whole time.


811
00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:00.980
There's absolutely no thinking.

812
00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.780
Are you willing to
suffer or not?


813
00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:03.660
That's it.

814
00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:04.700
It's killer.

815
00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:09.100
Three minute time cap,
it's good.


816
00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.740
As you move to
individual event number eight,


817
00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:17.220
Sam Briggs had a 30 point lead

818
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:21.020
over second place, Jamie
Green and it has changed.


819
00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:26.180
Jamie Green, five points,
now sitting in first.


820
00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:30.780
A lot of things can happen
with such a fast-paced event.


821
00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:33.260
The smallest hiccup
could be the difference


822
00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.500
between 10 places.

823
00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.380
And we saw a
painful event yesterday,


824
00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.940
this is going to be
basically the same realm.


825
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.180
The object here is
pedal to the metal.


826
00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.700
That was an awesome workout.

827
00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.460
No one had time to practice it.

828
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:56.100
You sort of went into it,
you knew it had to go well.


829
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.460
Normally on a bike,
I'm a bit smaller.


830
00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.620
So quite often I get
behind on a bike.


831
00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:07.300
This time, I was like, I'm not
going to lose on a bike again.


832
00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:17.380
And got to the burpees,
I'd never felt my legs so heavy.


833
00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:19.700
And you can see
what's happening with the leg.


834
00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:22.380
My legs
just didn't want to jump.


835
00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:25.780
It was the weirdest feeling
I've ever experienced.


836
00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:29.940
Mat Fraser
has moved ahead of everybody.


837
00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.900
Jamie Green was first
to the box,


838
00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:37.700
but Sam Briggs, Sam Briggs has
moved ahead of Jamie Green!


839
00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:40.100
Wow, all by himself.

840
00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:43.580
Mat Fraser another event win.

841
00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:45.620
Sitting in second no more,

842
00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:49.700
Sam Briggs has moved
back into first place!


843
00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:52.180
The worst an event is
supposed to hurt,


844
00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:54.380
the better Samantha Briggs does.

845
00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:56.340
And she gets shot
out of a cannon,


846
00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.940
and gets herself a
first place finish


847
00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:03.340
and a much needed 100 points
to put her back


848
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.260
into that top podium position.

849
00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:08.940
She just doesn't slow down.

850
00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:11.140
Samantha Briggs has an
incredible work capacity.


851
00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.660
And it's just like the closer the
race is, the harder she works.


852
00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.700
A lot of athletes can take
one or two events here and there


853
00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:19.980
but where you really
see the guys like Mat


854
00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.700
and athletes like
Dani, Sara, Laura,


855
00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:24.740
all these people really
make their space


856
00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:27.260
as the weekend gets longer
and the volume goes up.


857
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.780
When fatigue settles in,

858
00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.380
when, you know, people are
tired and hurting,


859
00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:32.876
that's when these guys
just kinda start


860
00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.940
making and taking their lead.

861
00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:37.460
You see Mat on the last
day there, he's going up.


862
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.700
Mat Fraser, back to back wins.

863
00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.540
He looks phenomenal.

864
00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:43.820
Phenomenal for this
early in the season.


865
00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:47.660
I can only imagine what it's gonna look
like towards the end of the season.


866
00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.420
You might be able to beat Mat
in one element of something,


867
00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.876
you might be
a better runner than him


868
00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.420
or slightly better at the row,

869
00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:54.980
or you might be able to lift

870
00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:58.020
a few more kilos than him
in one particular lift,


871
00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:00.060
but when you start to
mix stuff together


872
00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.540
like gymnastics, conditioning

873
00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.540
and all the other aspects
of fitness together,


874
00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:07.420
this is where he really shines
as the fittest man on Earth.


875
00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:09.260
I don't want to say,

876
00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:12.100
I mean it's the very first
event of the 2019 season.


877
00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:16.340
I don't see anyone that
can catch this guy.


878
00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:18.420
I don't think it's a secret.

879
00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.780
You know, I've been shown
that like I have


880
00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:22.940
an incredible
support network around me.


881
00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:27.020
Between Sammy,
and then my manager, Keith.


882
00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.100
They do anything and everything
they can to help me


883
00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:31.900
throughout the day, you know,

884
00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:35.380
take as many responsibilities
off my plate so I can focus


885
00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:39.220
and put all my time and energy
into training and competing.


886
00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.500
I just want a cold shower.

887
00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.140
Want to do the best I can.

888
00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:46.060
And if I want that happen
on the competition floor,


889
00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:49.500
I have to do it multiple
times a day


890
00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:52.660
and training repeatedly
throughout the whole year.


891
00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:00.540
Yo, that's my move.

892
00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:01.780
Yeah, don't take that.

893
00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.340
When you have so many
big guys here,


894
00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:07.460
you have to give everything
you have


895
00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:11.740
to stay in that top, top five.

896
00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:14.380
Like what was the goal
when you came out?


897
00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:16.500
To win, was it to make it
to the CrossFit Games?


898
00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:18.060
To win some money in Dubai?

899
00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:20.540
To win some money to
go to Australia.


900
00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.820
You wanted
to win some money to...


901
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.860
I'm doing the Australian
Championship.


902
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:29.060
- Oh, okay.
- So it was to win to pay to go and compete there.


903
00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.380
That was the plan.

904
00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:33.220
What's the plan now?

905
00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:36.060
The plan is now to try

906
00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.860
and qualify for the
CrossFit Games.


907
00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.220
I did not expect to
be like sat where I am,


908
00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.820
but it's so close up there.

909
00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.740
So, yeah. Playtime.

910
00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:02.020
We have 30 rep
total of barbell workout.


911
00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:05.740
It starts off with 15 snatches,
and then 15 clean and jerks.


912
00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:07.060
It's a six minute cap.

913
00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.180
And already
over in lane number eight,


914
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:14.020
Dani Speegle has moved
up into first.


915
00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.140
That was one
of my favorite events.


916
00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.660
It's only barbell,
heavy barbell.


917
00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:25.300
Could've been heavier,
then I would've been happier.


918
00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:31.580
Yeah, it's a hard one.
Like you're at the end of a weekend.


919
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.740
They're pretty heavy weights.

920
00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:36.980
It's one of those ones if you're
a bigger girl, it helps lot.


921
00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:41.020
Sara Sigmundsdottir
just hands in the air.


922
00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:43.140
Billy Georges trying to hang on.

923
00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.660
Mat Fraser has one rep.

924
00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:51.140
Final rep for Speegle and
she'll cross the finish line.


925
00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.100
That was
very impressive by Sara.


926
00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.220
She needed that event.

927
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.860
Again, one spot qualifies
for the game.


928
00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:05.500
And, man, these ladies are really
putting on a show for all of us.


929
00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:08.220
Best looking guy in
the competition.


930
00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:12.580
- Best looking guy? - Listen. He says I
need to quit CrossFit and do modeling.


931
00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:14.820
Physique, physique,
body building.


932
00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:17.420
- Interesting
- Do you agree?


933
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:20.780
- I second that opinion. - Best looking
man. Straight from physique competitor.


934
00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:24.300
I might have to retire
after this competition.


935
00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:25.700
Change career paths.

936
00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.740
Got that retirement fund
set up yet?


937
00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.460
Or are you just spending
it all on cars?


938
00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:34.180
One of the biggest draws for
Dubai by far is the prize money.


939
00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.020
Do you know about that 401K?

940
00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:40.140
Dubai offers more prize money
than any other sanctioned event.


941
00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:42.100
It's not just for
what your placing is


942
00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:43.700
on the overall leaderboard.

943
00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:45.620
You get prize money
for your finishes


944
00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.060
in every workout as well.

945
00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:51.220
It's $3,000 for first
in an event,


946
00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:54.620
$2,000 for second in an event,
and $1,000 for third in an event.


947
00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:58.460
The overall placement pays
out $50,000 for first,


948
00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.580
$30,000 for second,
$20,000 for third.


949
00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:03.660
One of the unique things
about the prize pot in Dubai


950
00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.700
is that everyone leaves
with something.


951
00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:07.660
No one comes and leaves
empty handed.


952
00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.540
So the minimum amount
you can make


953
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:13.380
for just coming to Dubai,
just showing up, is $1,500.


954
00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:14.820
All about diaper money.

955
00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.860
Even if you're not going to win

956
00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:18.620
or think to
get a place in top 10,


957
00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:20.340
you have the potential of making

958
00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:21.700
a pretty decent amount of money.

959
00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.500
Just by if you're
to win an event,


960
00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:25.580
or get top three
in an event, so...


961
00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:27.580
Brought a big duffel bag.

962
00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:30.460
The reason we make
sure that everyone makes money


963
00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:34.380
is so they can continue to be a
professional athlete and push harder.


964
00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:38.180
Athletes no longer have to worry about
flying to Dubai, and coming to Dubai.


965
00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:40.780
They can worry about competing,
they can worry about winning.


966
00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:43.180
There's a lot of athletes
out there now


967
00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:46.140
who are just focusing
on training,


968
00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.980
so they're not working as well.

969
00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:50.900
So that's a big attraction
for people to come over.


970
00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.700
So we're coming
to the end of the competition,


971
00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:55.580
and the organizers kind of had

972
00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:58.100
one more twist in
their back pocket.


973
00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:00.020
Just before the event,
they announced


974
00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:01.620
that the final event alone

975
00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:04.540
was gonna be worth
$30,000 to the winner.


976
00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:06.540
We timed it by 10, yeah.

977
00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:09.460
So it's $3,000,
time 10 it's 30, yeah.


978
00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:10.700
Which is good, yeah?

979
00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:13.300
Isn't it nicer than 10,000?

980
00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:15.660
Which is more
than most competitions


981
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.540
have in total just for that
last event out here in Dubai.


982
00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:19.980
Thirty grand.

983
00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:22.700
Pay off student loans with that.

984
00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:24.500
Thirty grand?

985
00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:25.500
That's decent.

986
00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:27.020
All for me.

987
00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:30.860
Straight to the gold and
diamond broker tomorrow.


988
00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.060
I want to be the best athlete

989
00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:35.420
because I want to show
people what I can do,


990
00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:38.940
and I want to show girls that
don't believe in themselves


991
00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:40.980
in a young age that
they can work hard,


992
00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:42.580
and be where I am.

993
00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:44.900
It doesn't drive me
to get prize money.


994
00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.180
And I may be one of few people

995
00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:52.180
that doesn't like money.

996
00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:57.060
The 2018 Dubai
CrossFit Championships


997
00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:59.940
is coming towards the end.

998
00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.260
It took nine events to get here,

999
00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:05.340
but only seven points
are actually separating


1000
00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.180
your top four athletes.

1001
00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:11.260
Four women that were all within

1002
00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:14.780
a decent points spread of
walking away with the win.


1003
00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:17.420
You had Sam Briggs who had been
towards the top all weekend long.


1004
00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:19.380
You had Jamie Green
who was right on Sam's tail.


1005
00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:20.860
You had Sara Sigmundsdottir,

1006
00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:22.660
who's been one of the favorites.

1007
00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:26.180
You kind of had a surprise
athlete in Karin Frey,


1008
00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:29.100
who's been hanging tough in
the top four all weekend long.


1009
00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:33.140
And for Mat Fraser, he
basically had the win locked up.


1010
00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:35.140
He was so far ahead
of everyone else,


1011
00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:37.220
he could just put it
on cruise control.


1012
00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:39.300
But now with that $30,000
on the line,


1013
00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:41.540
there's a tremendous
amount of incentive


1014
00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:44.620
for him to go out and
just torch this event,


1015
00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.300
and going full steam
ahead to try


1016
00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.460
and walk away with this $30,000.

1017
00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:00.060
All four of these ladies have a
different strength and a weakness


1018
00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:04.380
and they need to play their game.
You got to be very smart and aware of


1019
00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:06.380
where you are
and what you need to do.


1020
00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:08.300
There is a lot of things

1021
00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.900
that still need to happen,
so it's not just win or in,


1022
00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.940
unless you're Sam Briggs
or Jamie Green.


1023
00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:15.380
If you're Karin Frey
or Sara Sigmundsdottir,


1024
00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:17.740
you need to win
and have a little bit of help.


1025
00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:19.620
That was a very long workout.

1026
00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.180
It was a final and there was

1027
00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:23.100
a lot on the line for the girls.

1028
00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:25.140
So we were all on very
similar points


1029
00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:28.580
and it was almost like whoever
won the workout, won DCC.


1030
00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:37.340
One event stands
between four athletes,


1031
00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:41.060
and one trip to the
CrossFit Games.


1032
00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:44.540
I never look at leaderboards,
so I have no idea where I stand.


1033
00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:46.060
Was I fourth, was I fifth?

1034
00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.820
It's not often
that you get to go


1035
00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:52.660
out there and compete when there's
sort of like that much on the line.


1036
00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:55.860
And it was such a good workout
that it sort of had parts where


1037
00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:58.380
it's one person's strength,
one person's weakness,


1038
00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:01.060
another person's strength here.

1039
00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:04.940
Green is one
point behind Sam Briggs


1040
00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:06.460
on the leaderboard.

1041
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.900
On the left,
Sara Sigmundsdottir.


1042
00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:12.900
She needs to go
unbroken on these wall bumps.


1043
00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:16.420
The only thing you can do is to learn.
It's the best you can do.


1044
00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:19.500
And if you do that, then
you've reached your goal.


1045
00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:22.340
Briggs is off
the wall, onto the clean.


1046
00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:24.540
She's ahead of Green
and Sigmundsdottir.


1047
00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:33.500
We've had four events today.

1048
00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:35.980
Event number seven,
first place for Mat.


1049
00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:39.780
Event number eight,
first place for Mat.


1050
00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:43.700
Event nine, first place for Mat.

1051
00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:48.620
With two more sets, Mat
Fraser will go four for four.


1052
00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:55.780
Your 2018 Dubai CrossFit
Champion, Mat Fraser


1053
00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:57.740
is going back to
the CrossFit Games!


1054
00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:05.580
Sam Briggs is moving to the
barbell for the last time.


1055
00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:10.940
Sam is just the fit
type of human being.


1056
00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:13.420
Her lungs can keep on
going forever,


1057
00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:16.460
and she just always surprises
you how good she is.


1058
00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:19.540
20 meters for the lunges.

1059
00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:25.340
Sam is insane
and can train like hours on end.


1060
00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:29.020
I never see her like
struggling to workout


1061
00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:31.660
like how other people struggle.

1062
00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:34.540
She just keeps on going,
and going, and going.


1063
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:39.700
And with one
spread across the floor,


1064
00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:44.740
welcome back to the
CrossFit Games, Sam Briggs!


1065
00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:55.740
And the first person to run
over and congratulate her,


1066
00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:59.220
is Jamie Green just
being one point


1067
00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:01.940
away from qualifying herself.

1068
00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:08.580
Enemies on the floor,
when the clock starts


1069
00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:10.580
and then we're friends
straight after.


1070
00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:15.260
At the top, out of the game,

1071
00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:18.660
back in, barely making it,
having to go masters,


1072
00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:21.620
being injured, and then
in this particular


1073
00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:23.980
brand new setup,
the way that they do this,


1074
00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:27.220
that you have
one shot to get in,


1075
00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:28.860
and she made it into the shot.

1076
00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:39.860
How competitive this guy is?

1077
00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:41.900
He's getting better and stronger

1078
00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:45.060
beyond what we can possibly
imagine every year.


1079
00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:46.700
But you're right.

1080
00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.340
There's nothing that Mat
Fraser cannot handle.


1081
00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:52.820
Mat Fraser has now
set himself up


1082
00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:55.580
with an opportunity to fight

1083
00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:57.580
for his fourth consecutive title

1084
00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:59.700
at the CrossFit Games.

1085
00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:02.820
The last three years
it's been amazing.


1086
00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:05.860
It's been one of those cobs
that's up there with the Games,


1087
00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:10.020
so now the sanction is
going to grow even more.


1088
00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:13.100
Four different days,
ten workouts.


1089
00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:14.940
Then you got qualifications,

1090
00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:18.980
Dubai CrossFit Championship

1091
00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:21.500
But it's only the start
of the partnership.


1092
00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:24.140
2019 will be even better.

00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:57.580
It's been pretty cool,
like all weekend,


1110
00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:59.020
like really pushing.

1111
00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:00.980
It wasn't over
until the last workout.


1112
00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:03.060
Like it was fight
the full weekend,


1113
00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.940
so it was really good.

1114
00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:06.780
And training wise,

1115
00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:10.700
what does the next few
months look like for you?


1116
00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.420
Work on my weaknesses.

1117
00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:13.940
Get this elbow strong.

1118
00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:17.540
And yeah, hopefully get
ready for the Games.


1119
00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:21.940
♪ Get in

1120
00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:23.780
♪ We're celebrating
All night... ♪


1121
00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:26.500
Happy with second place.

1122
00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:30.020
Obviously want to win,
but it's out of range now.


1123
00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:32.180
He is so good.

1124
00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:33.220
You just cannot.

1125
00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:35.860
It's a good experience,
you know.


1126
00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:37.540
Like after that competition,

1127
00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:39.180
like what you need to work on,

1128
00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:41.780
like how you stand compared
to the other athletes.


1129
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.660
And, I mean, there are
a lot of other opportunities


1130
00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:47.100
to qualify for the Games, so

1131
00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:49.276
I'm pretty happy
with second place.


1132
00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:50.780
And I can't be other than happy.

1133
00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:52.420
Feel great.

1134
00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:55.940
It's so good to be
back competing.


1135
00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:58.020
You're happy
with placement you have?


1136
00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:01.980
Oh, I am. I made a few mistakes
throughout the weekend,


1137
00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:04.340
so I'm happy that
I still got there.


1138
00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:06.500
What was the
best part of the weekend?


1139
00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:08.500
It was the crowd.

1140
00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:11.300
The goosebumps when you
walk out to the floor,


1141
00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:13.300
you're so stressed
to start a workout,


1142
00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:14.940
and then
you just hear your name.


1143
00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:17.660
It's just the best feeling
in the world.


1144
00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:19.060
What now?

1145
00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:21.180
What's your path now?

1146
00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:25.300
Oh so now, I've only
been training


1147
00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.740
normally for eight weeks.

1148
00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:28.620
So now it's just WaterPalooza.

1149
00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:30.660
So I'm just keeping on training.

1150
00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:32.780
You're going to WaterPalooza?

1151
00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:33.740
Yeah, bro!

1152
00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.180
And the vigil.

1153
00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:37.700
Get some experience
back in this body.


1154
00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:40.820
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.


1155
00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:44.220
Feeling good, better than
before the last workout.


1156
00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:46.460
It was difficult to
have four workouts


1157
00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:48.620
on the last day
and we've shot regularly,


1158
00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:51.140
but it was the same
quarter outfit.


1159
00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:52.740
So what now, what's the goal?

1160
00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:55.380
Uh... Do the Open in France.

1161
00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:58.540
And maybe to get my
qualification for the Games,


1162
00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:02.780
and after working sanctionals,
and French full on.


1163
00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:06.220
He never ceases to amaze me,
but I'm not surprised.


1164
00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:08.820
And it never gets old,
I will tell you that.


1165
00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:10.540
It's so cool to watch.

1166
00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:12.380
I mean, he had already won.

1167
00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:14.660
Granted there was a lot
of money on the line,


1168
00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:15.980
but still that hurt bad.

1169
00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:17.620
That's so cool.

1170
00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:19.460
Such a great competitor,
you know?


1171
00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:21.900
So fun to watch.

1172
00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:24.500
Fun to be along for
the ride, you know?


1173
00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:25.580
So cool.

1174
00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:32.860
- Do you think anyone can beat Mat Fraser?
- Yes.


1175
00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:35.700
Do you think
you could be the man to beat?


1176
00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:38.100
I mean, I think anybody
can be beaten.


1177
00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:39.940
And I'm not gonna
count myself out.


1178
00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:41.540
I mean if I do that,

1179
00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:43.620
then I'm pretty much
just admitting to losing.


1180
00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:45.780
And I wouldn't be
a competitor and athlete


1181
00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:47.780
if I didn't believe
to some degree


1182
00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:49.740
that anybody could be beaten.

1183
00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:51.580
It can take any event.

1184
00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:53.940
One thing could happen,
you know? You never know.


1185
00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:55.860
And I think he
just has to be pressured.


1186
00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:58.620
I mean, I definitely think
whoever's gonna beat him


1187
00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:04.380
has to be 120% on their A game, and cannot have
any mistakes, 'cause he doesn't make mistakes.


1188
00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:08.620
And that's one thing of why he
does so well when he competes.


1189
00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:13.100
So it's just being able to just capitalize
on that and see how the weekend goes.


1190
00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:19.020
Do you think this competition would
be a good gauge to see where Mat is?


1191
00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:22.020
Well, you're not trying to
compare yourself to Mat as such,


1192
00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:23.940
but to see where you're
at as well?


1193
00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:25.780
Yeah, I mean the fact
that so many


1194
00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:27.620
Games athletes come
to this event.


1195
00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:30.820
So I mean, you're looking
at probably 25 out of 37


1196
00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:32.500
have been to the Games
on the male side,


1197
00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:37.500
so it kind of gives you
kind of a good head space


1198
00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:39.436
on where you're going to
be at going into the season


1199
00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:41.340
based on how you
probably do here


1200
00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:43.620
because most of the people
are starting to change


1201
00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:45.740
their training for
events like this


1202
00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:47.780
where there's a lot
of money backing it


1203
00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:51.300
and performance side of it that
didn't get you to the Games.


1204
00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:53.380
Everybody's
probably gonna be coming


1205
00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:57.180
and bringing their best A game
to show up here to earn the spot.
