00:00:42.506 --> 00:00:44.841
I mean, I'm that guy.

I've got enough of everything I need.

6
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.345
I'm single, I like a party,

7
00:00:49.346 --> 00:00:51.013
and I'm old enough to enjoy it.

8
00:00:51.014 --> 00:00:52.807
Young enough to enjoy it.

00:00:52.808 --> 00:00:57.019
I want to do
something, and I do it.

[WAITER] There seems to
be a little problem.

Oh. Must be the magnetic stripe.

12
00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:05.027
And the weird thing is

13
00:01:05.028 --> 00:01:06.529
I know it's all a clichÃ©.

14
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.364
No strings, no obligations,

15

but what's the alternative?

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.703
Get into some life, wife, kids,

17
00:01:13.704 --> 00:01:16.539
some kind of car with too many seats?

18
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.541
That's a world where you
have to do whatever it is

to do to keep it going.


20
00:01:21.128 --> 00:01:24.422
It's prostitution
when you think about it.


21
00:01:24.423 --> 00:01:27.967
But there is a nagging feeling
that I'm missing something.


22
00:01:27.968 --> 00:01:30.052
Sorry, I don't know
what the problem is.


23
00:01:30.053 --> 00:01:31.596
No, it's not your fault.

24
00:01:31.597 --> 00:01:33.431
That should do it.

25
00:01:33.432 --> 00:01:35.349
And maybe in the end,
I'm worrying for nothing.


26
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.143
I mean, I'm not at
this stage of my life


27
00:01:37.144 --> 00:01:39.729
where I have to worry
about most of this stuff.

Maybe I never will.

29
00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.819
I must sound pretty selfish.

Or just drunk.

31
00:01:48.322 --> 00:01:49.822
This is no good either.

32
00:01:49.823 --> 00:01:51.532
You're kidding.

33
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:53.242
Are you serious?

34
00:01:53.243 --> 00:01:54.827
Whoa. Come on, wait.

00:01:54.828 --> 00:01:56.412
You know I have money.

00:01:56.413 --> 00:01:58.080
I just don't have any on me...

37
00:01:58.081 --> 00:01:59.749
or on my credit cards,

38
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.501
but I get paid all the time,
and a lot.


39

as someone whose life
really is prostitution,

I can tell you that until you're
actually fucking for a living,


44
00:02:21.104 --> 00:02:22.772
you shouldn't be complaining.

Why do we eat meat?

The Greek gods dined
on ambrosia and nectar,


81
00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:08.330
but we need to incorporate
other species into us.

Look at Christianity.

"This is my body. 
This is my blood."

That's why I'm doing this chapter
about the genocide in Rwanda.


85
00:06:16.506 --> 00:06:18.340
The Tutsis were vegetarians,

86
00:06:18.341 --> 00:06:20.509
and the Hutus were ranchers,
who eat meat,


87
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.596
and they regarded the Tutsis
as monkeys, as animals,


88
00:06:23.597 --> 00:06:26.307
and that's why they had no trouble
killing them. Don't you think?

00:06:26.308 --> 00:06:28.017
Honestly, Ben, 
I don't know why

the farmer and the cowhand
can't be friends.


91
00:06:29.853 --> 00:06:32.313
But I do know
that part of the reason

92
00:06:32.314 --> 00:06:35.316
why some people regard
other people as animals


93
00:06:35.317 --> 00:06:37.693
is because they don't observe
the social conventions


94
00:06:37.694 --> 00:06:39.695
most of us take for granted.

95
00:06:39.696 --> 00:06:42.698
Every human function
is disgusting in our society.

I know what I am...

98
00:06:47.996 --> 00:06:50.164

broke, don't fix it."

Well, you're very wise.

I'm going to float you another loan.

dipped in Ranch.

There's just that cruddy house,

almost 150 acres of land.

347
00:22:08.082 --> 00:22:11.000
It's so weird to be home

00:22:11.001 --> 00:22:13.753

349
00:22:13.754 --> 00:22:16.427
how we just put him
in a hole in the ground.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:58.006
I mean, don't you want me to go

If Jerry Garcia hadn't lured you away

483
00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:28.980
you would have been
a great businessman.


484
00:29:28.981 --> 00:29:31.065
Who knew there was so much
money in a country store?


485
00:29:31.066 --> 00:29:33.067
I don't want money.

486
00:29:33.068 --> 00:29:35.236
You don't have to put such a
shitty spin on everything.


487
00:29:35.237 --> 00:29:37.530
Maybe this is your
father's way of giving you


488
00:29:37.531 --> 00:29:39.699
a chance to be what you
always wanted to be.


489
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.410
This is my father reaching from
beyond the grave to control me.


490
00:29:42.411 --> 00:29:44.412
The whole thing just insinuates
that I'm crazy,


491
00:29:44.413 --> 00:29:46.372
that there's something wrong
with the way that I live,


492
00:29:46.373 --> 00:29:48.166
but I'm fine. Everything's fine.

493
00:29:48.167 --> 00:29:50.084
I'm supporting you.
Of course everything's fine.


494
00:29:50.085 --> 00:29:53.212
Look, I'm the last person
that should be saying this,


495
00:29:53.213 --> 00:29:55.306
but what about me?

496
00:30:00.929 --> 00:30:02.930
How's that?

497
00:30:02.931 --> 00:30:05.183
- What's the difference?
- I don't like hurting you.


498
00:30:05.184 --> 00:30:08.060
Well, I don't like that making a
baby feels like chemotherapy.


499
00:30:08.061 --> 00:30:10.730
Look, honey, your dad just died.

500
00:30:10.731 --> 00:30:12.440
And I'm shooting you
full of hormones.


501
00:30:12.441 --> 00:30:14.363
If that doesn't make you crazy...

502
00:30:15.861 --> 00:30:18.159
Are we going to do this?

503
00:30:20.782 --> 00:30:22.533
You still look beautiful.

504
00:30:22.534 --> 00:30:25.378
Thank you.

00:30:28.498 --> 00:30:29.790
Sorry!

I'll be out in a minute.

507
00:30:31.835 --> 00:30:33.461
So you're really leaving?

508
00:30:33.462 --> 00:30:35.421
What are you going to do now?

509
00:30:35.422 --> 00:30:37.590
Some friends of mine have a farm
in upstate New York.


510
00:30:37.591 --> 00:30:40.468
Maybe I'll go hang out
with them for a while.


511
00:30:40.469 --> 00:30:44.889
Just growing incense
and making your own clothes?


512
00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:46.562
Not that you need any.

513
00:30:49.728 --> 00:30:51.771
No, actually, I have a degree.

514
00:30:51.772 --> 00:30:53.731
I'll probably go back
to teaching special ed.


515
00:30:53.732 --> 00:30:57.702
You got to look out for
Number One, I guess.


516
00:31:01.073 --> 00:31:03.616
You are so lovely.

517
00:31:03.617 --> 00:31:06.077
What's your point?

518
00:31:06.078 --> 00:31:08.496
It's just I knew the first Mrs. Baker

519
00:31:08.497 --> 00:31:11.499
and she wasn't even
remotely in your league.


520
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.627
I mean, ever.

521
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.170
Are you stoned?

522
00:31:16.171 --> 00:31:17.838
Sure, I'm the weird one.

523
00:31:17.839 --> 00:31:20.508
You had sex with a 900-year-old man.

524
00:31:20.509 --> 00:31:23.177
That barrel chest, those toenails.

525
00:31:23.178 --> 00:31:25.972
It probably sounds like a big joke,

526
00:31:25.973 --> 00:31:28.766
since that's what love always
sounds like to people like you,


527
00:31:28.767 --> 00:31:31.477
But Sam took pleasure
in everything in his life


528
00:31:31.478 --> 00:31:34.855
that was real, his food, his farm,

529
00:31:34.856 --> 00:31:39.110
his business, and yes, his wife.

530
00:31:39.111 --> 00:31:42.154
So when you were a little girl and
you imagined being with somebody,


531
00:31:42.155 --> 00:31:44.031
that was it?

532
00:31:44.032 --> 00:31:45.749
I can't believe you.

533
00:31:47.661 --> 00:31:49.620
Sam needed me.

534
00:31:49.621 --> 00:31:51.872
And he deserved me because
he was wonderful to me.


535
00:31:51.873 --> 00:31:54.000
You forget you're talking
about someone I knew


536
00:31:54.001 --> 00:31:55.710
longer than you actually.

537
00:31:55.711 --> 00:31:57.044
He stopped talking to his son.

538
00:31:57.045 --> 00:31:58.713
Ben stopped talking to him...

539
00:31:58.714 --> 00:32:00.591
and it broke his heart.

540
00:32:02.342 --> 00:32:05.553
Okay, well, maybe you'd better
run along and get high,


541
00:32:05.554 --> 00:32:06.887
so at least one of us can forget

542
00:32:06.888 --> 00:32:09.265
we had this conversation.

Honey, what are you doing out there?

00:33:07.074 --> 00:33:08.949
Just trying to keep these

- Morning.
- Morning.


550
00:33:35.268 --> 00:33:37.228
I could make you
some eggs if you want.


551
00:33:37.229 --> 00:33:39.438
Wait, now, are they the kind
with blood spots in them?


552
00:33:39.439 --> 00:33:41.440
They're eggs from chickens
who walk around.


553
00:33:41.441 --> 00:33:43.150
So they do have blood spots in them.

554
00:33:43.151 --> 00:33:45.403
Okay, everybody,
are you sitting down?

I had an incredible night.

And I swear to God
it was a visitation,

at it anymore.

Steve was right. 
This is my chance.

565
00:34:03.004 --> 00:34:04.755
Of course I can't do it alone,
but I was thinking


566
00:34:04.756 --> 00:34:06.715
about taking the money
from the grocery store


567
00:34:06.716 --> 00:34:08.801
and creating an institute
where people can come and study

00:34:08.802 --> 00:34:10.803
how to regain man's balance
with nature.

about all of this shit,

and you can give lessons on
cleaning and all that woman stuff,


572
00:34:17.519 --> 00:34:19.270
and Steve, if we're going
to have a society,


573
00:34:19.271 --> 00:34:20.771
we're going to need a TV station.

574
00:34:20.772 --> 00:34:23.023
You could have the whole station.

575
00:34:23.024 --> 00:34:24.571
That sounds great.

576
00:34:25.986 --> 00:34:28.279
You look like you haven't slept much.

577
00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.030
Why don't you sit down and
we'll have some breakfast


578
00:34:30.031 --> 00:34:32.199
and talk about the plan.

579
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.869
You understand I'm talking about
fundamental changes to society.

- I'm not hungry.

that much sense.

It's more like Buddha.

You can relax. I can see what's
going on in your face right now.


589
00:35:02.355 --> 00:35:04.482
It's one tenth of what's
going on in my mind.


590
00:35:04.483 --> 00:35:06.525
You told me that my father
had a plan for me,


591
00:35:06.526 --> 00:35:08.235
to do what I wanted,
and this is what I want,


592
00:35:08.236 --> 00:35:10.196
and I'm not leaving you behind.

593
00:35:10.197 --> 00:35:12.114
The TV station thing was
just off the top of my head.


594
00:35:12.115 --> 00:35:13.699
I want you to know that I'm grateful,

595
00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.493
and the way that I figure it,

596
00:35:15.494 --> 00:35:17.536
there's enough for me
to keep the grocery store,


597
00:35:17.537 --> 00:35:18.913
and for you to have the farm

598
00:35:18.914 --> 00:35:20.080
and the house.

599
00:35:20.081 --> 00:35:21.707
And it's not a gift.

You've earned it.

601
00:35:23.335 --> 00:35:25.419
Suddenly the plan seems
more appealing.

But I don't think you're...
you seem a little...

The journey to enlightenment
is stressful.


604

No, it's not enlightened.

Why are you so angry?

This was my mother's.

609
00:35:51.947 --> 00:35:53.405
I need you to mellow out.

610
00:35:53.406 --> 00:35:55.574
I need to keep my wits about me.

611
00:35:55.575 --> 00:35:57.743

- Please, you're out of control.

- Great...

This is important shit. This is
a chance to right your life.

cuz I can't do it all alone.

I need to talk to my brother.


619
00:36:13.134 --> 00:36:15.302
- He doesn't want to talk.
- Yes I do. I have a plan.


620
00:36:15.303 --> 00:36:17.263
- I'm going to start...
- You don't have to tell her your plan.


621
00:36:17.264 --> 00:36:19.306
Steve, I would prefer
to forgo your input


622
00:36:19.307 --> 00:36:22.268
and that most recently resulted
in my brother becoming fat,


623
00:36:22.269 --> 00:36:25.479
unemployed, and growing
that superbly antisocial beard.


624
00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.607
- Do not talk to him like that.
- No, it's okay.

You know what, Terri? I am
going to get out of your way,


626
00:36:30.652 --> 00:36:32.820
you can direct that rage
where it really belongs,

00:36:32.821 --> 00:36:34.698
at your grieving family.

628
00:36:40.745 --> 00:36:43.122
He doesn't understand
what's going on.


629

The decisions that you make now

630
00:36:44.624 --> 00:36:46.333
could secure a real future.

631
00:36:46.334 --> 00:36:48.294
You don't think I know that?

632
00:36:48.295 --> 00:36:50.588
I'm sorry. I guess I just
got blindsided yesterday.


633
00:36:50.589 --> 00:36:53.465
It blew me away, too. I didn't want
the headache, but then I thought


634
00:36:53.466 --> 00:36:56.427
all of this is part
of something amazing.


635
00:36:56.428 --> 00:36:58.762
Life stuff, renewal, rebuilding.

636
00:36:58.763 --> 00:37:00.848
Yes, exactly.

00:37:00.849 --> 00:37:02.683
I mean, this chrysalis has served us

638
00:37:02.684 --> 00:37:04.977
as we developed from pupae to adult,

639
00:37:04.978 --> 00:37:07.438
and now it has
to be shed and eaten.

640
00:37:07.439 --> 00:37:09.815
What are we talking about?

641
00:37:09.816 --> 00:37:11.442
I really want to utilize this capital

642
00:37:11.443 --> 00:37:13.152
to right some major wrongs,

643
00:37:13.153 --> 00:37:15.195
educate some mysteries,
set some ideas free.


644
00:37:15.196 --> 00:37:18.616
Well, why don't I find a way
to manage my finances


645
00:37:18.617 --> 00:37:20.543
so I can support you in eight months

646
00:37:20.544 --> 00:37:22.911
after you've pissed away what
it took Dad a lifetime to make.


647
00:37:22.912 --> 00:37:24.380
I hear where you're coming from,

648
00:37:24.381 --> 00:37:28.167
but it's just money. It doesn't
mean Dad loved me more than you.


649
00:37:28.168 --> 00:37:28.768
What?

650
00:37:28.769 --> 00:37:31.045
It doesn't mean Dad
loved me more than you.


651
00:37:31.046 --> 00:37:33.714
He didn't... love you more.

652
00:37:33.715 --> 00:37:36.847
You were the squeaky wheel,
so you got all the oil.


653
00:37:38.553 --> 00:37:40.554
And if I were you,

654
00:37:40.555 --> 00:37:45.026
I wouldn't rush off to go
change the world quite yet.


655
00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.900
Hello...

656
00:37:52.901 --> 00:37:54.818
Anybody?

657
00:37:54.819 --> 00:37:56.662
I'm going to go now.

658
00:38:05.664 --> 00:38:08.082
Ben?

659
00:38:08.083 --> 00:38:09.708
Ben?

660
00:38:09.709 --> 00:38:11.506
Yeah, I'm up here.

661
00:38:13.838 --> 00:38:15.881
Look at you.

662
00:38:15.882 --> 00:38:18.926
- Master of all that you survey.
- Yeah.


663
00:38:18.927 --> 00:38:21.762
You know, I wouldn't go if I
didn't have this job thing.


664
00:38:21.763 --> 00:38:24.181
I'll be back out next
weekend, I promise.


665
00:38:24.182 --> 00:38:26.517
Plus, you can always call.

666
00:38:26.518 --> 00:38:30.270
Oh, I'll call. I'll call as soon as
I get that big fat check for you.


667
00:38:30.271 --> 00:38:33.741
Hey, you know, I didn't think you
were really going to do that.


668
00:38:34.192 --> 00:38:35.442
Hey, buddy?

669
00:38:35.443 --> 00:38:37.195
I love you.

670
00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.998
Take a shower, okay?

671
00:38:48.581 --> 00:38:50.207
Wait, so you're just going to leave?

672
00:38:50.208 --> 00:38:52.209
Yeah, I got to get going.

673
00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:54.628
It was really great to see you,
and thanks for the pie.


674
00:38:54.629 --> 00:38:55.879
That was for dinner.

675
00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.089
I'll be eating dinner.

676
00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:58.799
No, for everyone.

677
00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.592
You're not as giving
as I thought you were.


678
00:39:00.593 --> 00:39:02.803
I don't want the pie back. I just...

679
00:39:02.804 --> 00:39:04.638
Well, I guess you know Ben
better than I do.


680
00:39:04.639 --> 00:39:06.598
Is he going to be
okay here by himself?


681
00:39:06.599 --> 00:39:08.058
By himself?

682
00:39:08.059 --> 00:39:10.102
What, now you're going to leave?

683
00:39:10.103 --> 00:39:11.937
- I mean, with that poor kid up there?
- So he's not okay.


684
00:39:11.938 --> 00:39:13.397
He's right as rain.

685
00:39:13.398 --> 00:39:14.648
I mean, his father just died,

686
00:39:14.649 --> 00:39:16.442
he's got a drug problem,

687
00:39:16.443 --> 00:39:18.694
probably some kind of
manic-depressive disorder,


688
00:39:18.695 --> 00:39:22.281
and honestly, he wasn't that well
screwed together to begin with,


689
00:39:22.282 --> 00:39:24.783
but he's an adult,
and I have to go back


690
00:39:24.784 --> 00:39:26.410
to do the 4:30 weather.

691
00:39:26.411 --> 00:39:28.495
And although
you're under no obligation


692
00:39:28.496 --> 00:39:31.498
would it be so bad to take
another two or three weeks


693
00:39:31.499 --> 00:39:33.917
before you do whatever
bullshit you have to do?


694
00:39:33.918 --> 00:39:37.337
You mean teaching disabled kids?

695
00:39:37.338 --> 00:39:39.173
Oh, now they're disabled.

696
00:39:39.174 --> 00:39:41.927
Do you have any actual plans?

697
00:39:44.721 --> 00:39:47.765
- I guess I could take my time moving out.
- Great.


698
00:39:47.766 --> 00:39:49.057
You get a week,

699
00:39:49.058 --> 00:39:50.809
and I'm not adopting him.

700
00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:53.062
Perfect. I'm going
to leave you my number...


701
00:39:54.022 --> 00:39:55.814
in case you have to get in touch.

702
00:39:55.815 --> 00:39:58.818
Because, you know, I'm on TV.

703
00:40:01.738 --> 00:40:05.866
Yeah, actually Sam
bragged about you once.


704
00:40:05.867 --> 00:40:08.368
I think he liked you, but he
couldn't really express it.


705
00:40:08.369 --> 00:40:11.789
Yeah, it always came out
as "moron-troublemaker."


706
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:13.832
He hated the Irish, too.

707
00:40:13.833 --> 00:40:15.676
People forget that.

708
00:40:17.796 --> 00:40:20.047
Okay, now will you let me know
if I run over a chicken,


709
00:40:20.048 --> 00:40:22.883
'cause the pie
is all I can eat right now.


710
00:40:22.884 --> 00:40:24.468
How long does he stay up there?

711
00:40:24.469 --> 00:40:26.312
Let me know.

712
00:40:49.577 --> 00:40:52.037
- Hey.
- Hey.


713
00:40:52.038 --> 00:40:53.872
How are you holding up?

714
00:40:53.873 --> 00:40:55.916
[SIGHS] I don't know.

715
00:40:55.917 --> 00:40:57.543
It's all temporary, right?

716
00:40:57.544 --> 00:40:59.378
Angela, you knew when you decided

717
00:40:59.379 --> 00:41:01.713
to get involved with
a man so much older


718
00:41:01.714 --> 00:41:03.549
it wasn't for life.

719
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:06.009
You are so sentimental.

720
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:07.511
Okay, all's I'm saying

721
00:41:07.512 --> 00:41:09.346
is that you had that experience.

722
00:41:09.347 --> 00:41:11.598
Now don't be afraid
to be with a man your age.


723
00:41:11.599 --> 00:41:13.316
You got a whole time ahead.

724
00:41:15.478 --> 00:41:17.187
Ben asked me to put these up.

725
00:41:17.188 --> 00:41:20.274
I have some. They upset people.

726
00:41:20.275 --> 00:41:22.276
Hey, Mom. Sam Stallsworth is outside.

727
00:41:22.277 --> 00:41:23.944
You're going to have to
negotiate the lettuce with him.


728
00:41:23.945 --> 00:41:25.279
Now listen, I've got to go.

729
00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.614
I might need my hands.

730
00:41:27.615 --> 00:41:29.533
Okay.

731
00:41:29.534 --> 00:41:31.832
- Hello, Terri.
- Good morning, sunshine.


732
00:41:37.208 --> 00:41:39.126
It's hard, huh...

733
00:41:39.127 --> 00:41:40.460
without him?

734
00:41:40.461 --> 00:41:42.133
Yeah, try to keep busy.

735
00:41:44.507 --> 00:41:46.300
Uh, about Ben.

736
00:41:46.301 --> 00:41:48.635
Oh, God, don't stick
your nose in that, too.


737
00:41:48.636 --> 00:41:50.671
I'm living with him, Terri.

738
00:41:50.672 --> 00:41:53.640
Nobody asked you to. In fact, I'm
surprised you didn't blow out of town


739
00:41:53.641 --> 00:41:54.975
on the next guy who came through.

740
00:41:54.976 --> 00:41:57.477
Oh, Jesus. That tongue.

741
00:41:57.478 --> 00:41:59.980
I think you just spoiled
all the vegetables in here.


742
00:41:59.981 --> 00:42:02.274
You know, you came
into my family very recently,


743
00:42:02.275 --> 00:42:04.484
and you started telling
everybody what to do,


744
00:42:04.485 --> 00:42:05.903
which was nothing.

745
00:42:05.904 --> 00:42:08.071
- Do nothing.
- That is not true.


746
00:42:08.072 --> 00:42:10.949
You convinced my father to let
a thriving business go to seed.


747
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:12.492
"These are the good years.

748
00:42:12.493 --> 00:42:13.994
"Life is for living."

749
00:42:13.995 --> 00:42:15.913
I mean, Christ, a man his age

750
00:42:15.914 --> 00:42:18.749
throwing himself at yoga
and guitar lessons?


751
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:20.000
You don't believe in growing!

752
00:42:20.001 --> 00:42:21.627
You don't grow!

753
00:42:21.628 --> 00:42:23.337
You're a tumbleweed

754
00:42:23.338 --> 00:42:25.422
who blows around
whenever the wind changes.


755
00:42:25.423 --> 00:42:28.508
Shit, I swore I wouldn't engage.

756
00:42:28.509 --> 00:42:29.968
I got to go.

757
00:42:29.969 --> 00:42:32.096
You know, people hide in charity.

758
00:42:33.723 --> 00:42:36.642
Once in a while, assume other
people are as good as you.


759
00:42:36.643 --> 00:42:38.315
Not worse.

760
00:42:40.063 --> 00:42:41.735
They're not.

761
00:42:43.733 --> 00:42:45.651
(VICTORIA) How was the vacation?

762
00:42:45.652 --> 00:42:47.277
It wasn't a vacation.

763
00:42:47.278 --> 00:42:49.321
Oh, did you get your eyes done?

764
00:42:49.322 --> 00:42:52.658
- Delia got some fan mail, you know.
- Is that right?


765
00:42:52.659 --> 00:42:54.326
A hundred bucks says Delia's fan mail

766
00:42:54.327 --> 00:42:56.370
came from a member
of the cafeteria staff.


767
00:42:56.371 --> 00:42:58.205
[MAN] Corporate thinks
each piece of mail


768
00:42:58.206 --> 00:43:00.332
represents 1000 viewers.

769
00:43:00.333 --> 00:43:02.376
What, did she do a really good job?

770
00:43:02.377 --> 00:43:05.128
Hey, what was with you wrestling
that bum the other day?


771
00:43:05.129 --> 00:43:09.007
- Nicely done.
- So did you know him or something?


772
00:43:09.008 --> 00:43:11.051
You know how it is, you buy
someone a cup of coffee


773
00:43:11.052 --> 00:43:13.971
and suddenly they're
your best friend.


774
00:43:13.972 --> 00:43:16.565
- Do I need my eyes done?
- 30 seconds.


775
00:43:16.566 --> 00:43:18.642
It would be illegal
to make them any bluer.


776
00:43:18.643 --> 00:43:21.144
See, that's what I think.

777
00:43:21.145 --> 00:43:22.771
Spinach check.

778
00:43:23.815 --> 00:43:26.358
You have no whitening trays.

779
00:43:26.359 --> 00:43:28.702
Now I really can't stay.

780
00:43:32.615 --> 00:43:35.701
God, it must be tough
having to win the viewers over


781
00:43:35.702 --> 00:43:38.745
one at a time like this.

782
00:43:38.746 --> 00:43:42.165
You know, while you were off getting
your eyes done over the weekend,


783
00:43:42.166 --> 00:43:45.585
Paul flew me to Martha's
Vineyard to show me this house


784
00:43:45.586 --> 00:43:50.382
and it wasn't one of those stupid
Cape Cod houses the tourists love.


785
00:43:50.383 --> 00:43:52.342
This was a year-round home

786
00:43:52.343 --> 00:43:54.845
where you could really be
a part of the island.


787
00:43:54.846 --> 00:43:57.597
Paul understands the
limitations of our job


788
00:43:57.598 --> 00:43:58.765
and let's face it,

789
00:43:58.766 --> 00:44:00.350
it's a short window,

790
00:44:00.351 --> 00:44:02.019
and it's not really based on skill.

791
00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:03.687
Yeah, I know that.

792
00:44:03.688 --> 00:44:05.439
Lucky for me, my finances

793
00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.191
have kind of been
taking care of themselves.


794
00:44:08.192 --> 00:44:10.068
Sandwich guy told me
you nailed the baseball pool.


795
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:12.946
No, really, I'm coming
into a little piece of property


796
00:44:12.947 --> 00:44:14.614
up in Lancaster myself.

797
00:44:14.615 --> 00:44:16.283
I'll probably unload it.

798
00:44:16.284 --> 00:44:18.118
Brian Williams has a place up there.

799
00:44:18.119 --> 00:44:20.496
I don't think so.

800
00:44:22.623 --> 00:44:25.459
Thanks for the ride.

801
00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:29.421
Which is why I'm sick and
tired of the bullshit.


802
00:44:29.422 --> 00:44:31.214
Excuse me, sorry.

803
00:44:31.215 --> 00:44:32.549
I was just passing through.

804
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:34.893
Sit, please. Join us.

805
00:44:37.055 --> 00:44:39.765
Everybody, this is Angela...

806
00:44:39.766 --> 00:44:41.609
my stepmother.

807
00:44:44.562 --> 00:44:47.156
Didn't we meet
at the plastic bag rally?


808
00:44:48.232 --> 00:44:50.442
Your skin is so white.

809
00:44:50.443 --> 00:44:52.411
I think we should listen now.

810
00:44:54.405 --> 00:44:57.824
If we create a nonprofit society,

811
00:44:57.825 --> 00:44:59.826
we can reap the tax benefits

812
00:44:59.827 --> 00:45:01.244
of said society.

813
00:45:01.245 --> 00:45:03.163
It is going to be a beginning

814
00:45:03.164 --> 00:45:05.290
and an ending of
life as we know it

815
00:45:05.291 --> 00:45:08.168
and that is why I am calling it

816
00:45:08.169 --> 00:45:09.841
The Omega Society.

817
00:45:11.422 --> 00:45:13.507
I hate to stick my nose
into this, but...


818
00:45:13.508 --> 00:45:16.510
No, everyone's voice has equal merit.

819
00:45:16.511 --> 00:45:19.596
The Omega Society sounds like
the Omega Institute.


820
00:45:19.597 --> 00:45:22.182
It's a holistic organization,

821
00:45:22.183 --> 00:45:25.977
environmentalism, spiritual rebirth.

822
00:45:25.978 --> 00:45:28.688
It's total synchronicity
is what it is.


823
00:45:28.689 --> 00:45:31.483
Not only is it the perfect name
for our society,


824
00:45:31.484 --> 00:45:34.111
but it already exists.

825
00:45:34.112 --> 00:45:36.363
I think there's
an Omega Society, too,


826
00:45:36.364 --> 00:45:38.031
so I don't think legally we can...

827
00:45:38.032 --> 00:45:40.867
Justin, it's not about what is legal.

828
00:45:40.868 --> 00:45:42.786
I grew up out here.

829
00:45:42.787 --> 00:45:44.955
There are Amish people
on three sides of this farm.


830
00:45:44.956 --> 00:45:47.833
They don't vote.
They don't join the Army.


831
00:45:47.834 --> 00:45:51.503
They don't send their children
to our schools.


832
00:45:51.504 --> 00:45:54.840
When you live off the land,

833
00:45:54.841 --> 00:45:56.341
and you're honest,

834
00:45:56.342 --> 00:45:58.765
things fall into place.

835
00:46:01.055 --> 00:46:05.150
You are a beacon
to that Babylon out there.


836
00:46:05.977 --> 00:46:08.311
My cousin lives in Oregon.

837
00:46:08.312 --> 00:46:09.734
Ben's right.

838
00:46:16.404 --> 00:46:19.573
So I've never seen you
at the Marriott before.


839
00:46:19.574 --> 00:46:21.741
Oh, I really shouldn't.

840
00:46:21.742 --> 00:46:24.327
You just going to go home and
stare at an empty dog bed?


841
00:46:24.328 --> 00:46:26.246
Chester doesn't get home
from the hospital


842
00:46:26.247 --> 00:46:29.040
till tomorrow, right?

843
00:46:29.041 --> 00:46:30.876
His name is Clarence.

844
00:46:30.877 --> 00:46:32.919
He got out of the hospital today,

845
00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.589
and my mom is watching him.

846
00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:37.090
But you sure are a good listener.

847
00:46:37.091 --> 00:46:38.592
So are you,

848
00:46:38.593 --> 00:46:40.970
and a very beautiful one actually.

849
00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:49.769
I think Clarence needs me.

850
00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:51.688
Seriously, I'm really fast.

851
00:46:51.689 --> 00:46:53.273
[PHONE BUZZES]

852
00:46:53.274 --> 00:46:54.941
Did you give my number to someone?

853
00:46:54.942 --> 00:46:56.276
- I don't even have your...
- Shh, one second.


854
00:46:56.277 --> 00:46:58.370
Hello?

855
00:46:59.697 --> 00:47:01.573
I really didn't mean to bother you.

856
00:47:01.574 --> 00:47:04.284
Ben's fine, but we just got
this registered letter.


857
00:47:04.285 --> 00:47:05.785
Terri is challenging the will.

858
00:47:05.786 --> 00:47:07.746
Why? I mean, I know why,

859
00:47:07.747 --> 00:47:09.122
but under what grounds?

860
00:47:09.123 --> 00:47:11.291
Well, it's Ben's competency.

861
00:47:11.292 --> 00:47:14.461
There's going to be a hearing,
and he has to see a psychiatrist.


862
00:47:14.462 --> 00:47:16.296
Can you believe this?

863
00:47:16.297 --> 00:47:18.798
This morning, the bank
account was shut down.


864
00:47:18.799 --> 00:47:21.259
It's a classic obstacle to a pioneer.

865
00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:24.429
It's like Galileo or Che, or Jesus.

866
00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:26.473
Every great move has a counter move.

867
00:47:26.474 --> 00:47:29.142
But let me tell you,
my sister's greed


868
00:47:29.143 --> 00:47:31.478
is not going to stop the
evolution of mind and body


869
00:47:31.479 --> 00:47:33.146
that's going on out here.

870
00:47:33.147 --> 00:47:35.273
No, no, no, look.
You need to calm down.


871
00:47:35.274 --> 00:47:37.817
- Just get a lawyer.
- A law...


872
00:47:37.818 --> 00:47:38.985
You think I'm crazy now?

873
00:47:38.986 --> 00:47:40.904
Go see the shrink.

874
00:47:40.905 --> 00:47:42.998
It's like giving them the
money if you don't go.


875
00:47:44.575 --> 00:47:48.070
- I could be my own lawyer you know.
- There you go.


876
00:47:48.071 --> 00:47:50.914
I could prepare a brief, one of those

877
00:47:50.915 --> 00:47:53.383
They don't know
who they're fucking with.

00:47:59.924 --> 00:48:01.424
Hey, are you still there?

00:48:01.425 --> 00:48:03.802
Yes, any other fires to put out?

880
00:48:03.803 --> 00:48:06.012
It is just getting
more and more intense,


881
00:48:06.013 --> 00:48:08.481
and there are a lot of
other people involved now.


882
00:48:10.184 --> 00:48:13.019
Like you and me?

883
00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:15.146
No, I mean, there are
these hippie kids now


884
00:48:15.147 --> 00:48:18.525
and the store,
and now this court thing.


885
00:48:18.526 --> 00:48:20.485
He just seems very agitated.

886
00:48:20.486 --> 00:48:23.029
And I mean, I've been trying
to deal with it, but...


887
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:25.865
[SIGHS]
I'm just glad I could call you.


888
00:48:25.866 --> 00:48:28.164
You can always call me.

889
00:48:29.495 --> 00:48:31.705
- I'm leaving.
- [WHISPERS] Maybe you should...


890
00:48:31.706 --> 00:48:33.957
Oh, my God. Is there someone there?

891
00:48:33.958 --> 00:48:37.043
No, I'm alone.

892
00:48:37.044 --> 00:48:38.378
Now.

893
00:48:38.379 --> 00:48:40.547
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.


894
00:48:40.548 --> 00:48:43.842
You're just doing your job.

895
00:48:43.843 --> 00:48:46.095
My job, actually.

896
00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:51.057
Well, I don't really know him.

897
00:48:51.058 --> 00:48:54.853
He's Ben. He's a blast
most of the time.


898
00:48:54.854 --> 00:48:57.063
But you didn't know his mother.

899
00:48:57.064 --> 00:49:00.692
He inherited some things
that weren't in the will.


900
00:49:00.693 --> 00:49:03.028
Yeah, Sam mentioned that.

901
00:49:03.029 --> 00:49:07.073
Probably nothing like the free love,
whole foods thing you grew up in.


902
00:49:07.074 --> 00:49:11.369
My father was an actuary for The
Hartford insurance company.


903
00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:14.372
He died at his desk.
I was still at Andover.


904
00:49:14.373 --> 00:49:18.251
Huh. Like say about Sam's age?

905
00:49:18.252 --> 00:49:20.880
- What?
- So you must be loaded?


906
00:49:23.549 --> 00:49:25.425
Is he going to be okay or not?

907
00:49:25.426 --> 00:49:27.218
This is the way it usually goes.

908
00:49:27.219 --> 00:49:30.430
The best thing to do
is keep feeding him.


909
00:49:30.431 --> 00:49:32.432
Food is nature's Vicodin.

910
00:49:32.433 --> 00:49:35.311
That's good, too,
by the way, if you have it.


911
00:49:37.897 --> 00:49:41.024
You should finally be getting
some rain up that way, you know?


912
00:49:41.025 --> 00:49:44.324
Mm, I'm not too sure about that.

913
00:49:57.708 --> 00:49:59.459
Well...

914
00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:01.587

915
00:50:02.588 --> 00:50:04.806

Greetings.

Sorry to keep bothering
you like that.

I don't think
getting a glass of water

is the biggest inconvenience
for these people right now.

I was just explaining my admiration

938
00:51:56.368 --> 00:51:57.911
for these people.

939
00:51:57.912 --> 00:51:59.662
They live off the land in kindness.

940
00:51:59.663 --> 00:52:02.081
They don't believe
in war or pollution.


941
00:52:02.082 --> 00:52:06.085
I'll tell you. One day, when there's
no earth left, because we used it up,


942
00:52:06.086 --> 00:52:09.590
there will be 10 square miles of
Lancaster County where God still exists.


943
00:52:10.799 --> 00:52:12.675
Why are you naked?

944
00:52:12.676 --> 00:52:15.261
I didn't want that chemical
smell on me anymore.


945
00:52:15.262 --> 00:52:17.388
That smell is not chemicals.

946
00:52:17.389 --> 00:52:19.766
It's B.O. because you
have stopped showering


947
00:52:19.767 --> 00:52:22.060
and you ruined everything
I bought you at The Gap,


948
00:52:22.061 --> 00:52:24.395
- which you loved.
- I don't anymore.


949
00:52:24.396 --> 00:52:26.022
We are going.

950
00:52:26.023 --> 00:52:27.899
This entire incident is inappropriate

951

and probably illegal,
and if I were Mr. Yoder,


952
00:52:30.945 --> 00:52:33.780
I would make you pay for the fact
that I missed two hours of farmwork


953
00:52:33.781 --> 00:52:36.032
so I could ride
into town on a buggy

954
00:52:36.033 --> 00:52:37.700
to get a cop out here.

955
00:52:37.701 --> 00:52:39.869
You're wrong.
We're having a conversation!


956
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:41.788
I don't want
to speak out of turn here,


957
00:52:41.789 --> 00:52:44.457
but Felty and Sarah
are not being hospitable.


958
00:52:44.458 --> 00:52:47.460
They're pacifists,
and this is how they respond


959
00:52:47.461 --> 00:52:49.679
to being held hostage.

960
00:53:00.099 --> 00:53:01.808
Gosh, I'm...

961
00:53:01.809 --> 00:53:03.643
I
-I never meant to... I didn't...

962
00:53:03.644 --> 00:53:06.112
Ben, I think you can keep the apron.

963
00:53:08.899 --> 00:53:10.275
Let's go.

964
00:53:11.777 --> 00:53:14.320
Yes, the best way to get
the soda out of the bottle


965
00:53:14.321 --> 00:53:17.156
is to shake it and
shake it and shake it.


966
00:53:17.157 --> 00:53:18.783
You need a ride?

967
00:53:19.493 --> 00:53:20.744
Yes.

968
00:53:25.749 --> 00:53:27.542
Next time, go over to the highway

969
00:53:27.543 --> 00:53:29.335
and get Anderson
to ring the fire bell for you.


970
00:53:29.336 --> 00:53:31.004
I will. I apologize.

971
00:53:31.005 --> 00:53:32.964
I might have been
in a bit of a panic.


972
00:53:32.965 --> 00:53:36.134
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Yoder.

973
00:53:36.135 --> 00:53:38.303
I am sorry to hear about your father.

974
00:53:38.304 --> 00:53:39.679
Thank you very much.

975
00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.514
We all miss him, obviously.

976
00:53:41.515 --> 00:53:44.183
He was lucky to have a long life.

977
00:53:44.184 --> 00:53:45.852
Such a caring daughter.

978
00:53:45.853 --> 00:53:48.771
All he cared about was his family.

979
00:53:48.772 --> 00:53:52.071
Surely there's no other reason
for being on this Earth.


980
00:53:53.944 --> 00:53:56.654
What would you do if you
couldn't have children?


981
00:53:56.655 --> 00:53:59.749
I would pray to God
to send them to me.


982
00:54:00.743 --> 00:54:02.916
What if you don't believe in God?

983
00:54:05.664 --> 00:54:07.962
Maybe that's why
you can't have children.


984
00:54:15.382 --> 00:54:18.343
Honestly, Ben,
you really fucked me here.


985
00:54:18.344 --> 00:54:20.637
My independence of mind
is obviously a threat to them.


986
00:54:20.638 --> 00:54:23.181
- Them?
- Society.


987
00:54:23.182 --> 00:54:24.641
With all their poison.

988
00:54:24.642 --> 00:54:26.517
I'm not putting it in my body.

989
00:54:26.518 --> 00:54:28.645
And I respect that deep-fried
temple that you built,


990
00:54:28.646 --> 00:54:32.023
but you have to stop running naked.

991
00:54:32.024 --> 00:54:34.067
I know. I panicked.

992
00:54:34.068 --> 00:54:36.402
Even the most committed messenger
has a moment of doubt.


993
00:54:36.403 --> 00:54:38.154
Keep that word "committed" in mind.

994
00:54:38.155 --> 00:54:40.239
- Next time.
- Oh, you mean in the courtroom?


995
00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.824
Because that's where we're heading,

996
00:54:41.825 --> 00:54:43.493
and they might not stop
with the money.


997
00:54:43.494 --> 00:54:45.203
They can force you
to take the medicine,


998
00:54:45.204 --> 00:54:47.580
- and they can lock you up.
- [KNOCKING]


999

We're studying in here.

1000
00:54:49.083 --> 00:54:50.583
Anyone hungry?

1001
00:54:50.584 --> 00:54:51.668
Not really.

1002
00:54:51.669 --> 00:54:53.586
I got to go.

1003
00:54:53.587 --> 00:54:55.421
Ben, you okay?

1004
00:54:55.422 --> 00:54:58.424
I don't know. I'm feeling
a little stressed out.


1005
00:54:58.425 --> 00:55:00.259
I'm stressed out. You're crazy.

1006
00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:03.554
Let's use the word freely
as if it gives us power.


1007
00:55:03.555 --> 00:55:05.102
Goodnight.

1008
00:55:13.732 --> 00:55:15.775
I see you've been arrested
a few times.


1009
00:55:15.776 --> 00:55:17.694
Public outbursts, indecency.

1010
00:55:17.695 --> 00:55:20.029
A misdemeanor
related to your profession


1011
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:23.282
which you listed here
as "small farmer."


1012
00:55:23.283 --> 00:55:26.536
I also see that you've
never considered medication.


1013
00:55:26.537 --> 00:55:28.621
Anti-depressants?

1014
00:55:28.622 --> 00:55:30.915
They have been suggested,

1015
00:55:30.916 --> 00:55:33.960
as they have been to most of America.

1016
00:55:33.961 --> 00:55:36.379
Well, I was thinking
more like a mood stabilizer,


1017
00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:39.090
which for most is a very
effective therapeutic solution.


1018
00:55:39.091 --> 00:55:43.428
No need to resist
the magic of lithium, I know.


1019
00:55:43.429 --> 00:55:46.806
We should sprinkle its salty goodness
over the fries at McDonald's


1020
00:55:46.807 --> 00:55:50.184
until we're "Dawn of the Dead"
drooling towards Banana Republic,


1021
00:55:50.185 --> 00:55:52.270
pushing our carts
dazed through the market,


1022
00:55:52.271 --> 00:55:54.021
throwing the meat in,

1023
00:55:54.022 --> 00:55:57.901
black blood pooling
under so much plastic.


1024
00:55:58.736 --> 00:56:00.570
That's an interesting image.

1025
00:56:00.571 --> 00:56:02.488
Which I wouldn't have
if I was zonked on that shit.


1026
00:56:02.489 --> 00:56:04.532
I wouldn't feel
this hum I've got going.


1027
00:56:04.533 --> 00:56:07.118
Clear, sharp, and purposeful,

1028
00:56:07.119 --> 00:56:10.163
like every ion in my body
is vibrating with genius.


1029
00:56:10.164 --> 00:56:11.998
Marijuana is a chemical.

1030
00:56:11.999 --> 00:56:13.499
It's green and from the Earth.

1031
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:15.126
But it's a drug,

1032
00:56:15.127 --> 00:56:16.961
a way of dealing with your symptoms.

1033
00:56:16.962 --> 00:56:18.838
Like the drug you get
when you go into a restaurant


1034
00:56:18.839 --> 00:56:20.840
or come home after work,

1035
00:56:20.841 --> 00:56:23.176
or offer a stranger the moment
they come into your house.


1036
00:56:23.177 --> 00:56:27.346
Our whole social system
is built around some drug.


1037
00:56:27.347 --> 00:56:30.191
Most cultures made beer
before they had an alphabet.


1038
00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:33.519
I'm going to ask you some questions,

1039
00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:36.689
and you can just tell me
yes or no, okay?


1040
00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:40.410
Do you experience sensations
of things that are not there?


1041
00:56:42.237 --> 00:56:44.330
Do you hear voices?

1042
00:56:49.161 --> 00:56:51.254
Are you afraid right now?

1043
00:56:55.125 --> 00:56:57.753
There are times that are wonderful,

1044
00:56:59.713 --> 00:57:01.881
and there are times
that are horrible.


1045
00:57:01.882 --> 00:57:05.927
And the wonderful thing is
right now, I feel alive.


1046
00:57:05.928 --> 00:57:08.054
But the terrible thing is
that you're not asking me


1047
00:57:08.055 --> 00:57:09.764
how I feel about my father dying.

1048
00:57:09.765 --> 00:57:11.349
Oh, well I was going...

1049
00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:14.018
I feel alone in the universe,

1050
00:57:14.019 --> 00:57:15.736
except for Steve.

1051
00:57:19.983 --> 00:57:22.531
So why do you think you're here?

1052
00:57:25.489 --> 00:57:27.573
Because I won the lottery.

1053

to Barry with his suited ace.


1055

80,000 to call to see a flop here.

1056
00:57:36.583 --> 00:57:39.632
And he will have position after.

1057
00:57:49.763 --> 00:57:52.937
Yes, yes, you'll clean up later.

1058
00:58:00.899 --> 00:58:05.745
No... motherfucking goddamn dammit!

1059

[SIGHS]

1060
00:58:09.491 --> 00:58:11.409
Look at it. It's huge.

1061
00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:13.411
Leaves and acorns everywhere.

1062
00:58:13.412 --> 00:58:14.996
You got to get rid of it.

1063
00:58:14.997 --> 00:58:17.331
The building is called The Oaks.

1064
00:58:17.332 --> 00:58:18.666
It's the only one left.

1065
00:58:18.667 --> 00:58:20.626
It's just a tree.

1066
00:58:20.627 --> 00:58:22.253
It blocks all the natural light,

1067
00:58:22.254 --> 00:58:25.089
Plus, it decreases
the value of my unit.


1068
00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:27.508
I can circulate a petition
if you want,


1069
00:58:27.509 --> 00:58:29.427
but you know
everybody feels the same,


1070
00:58:29.428 --> 00:58:32.681
and you got to be sick
of cleaning up all this crap.

I'll see what I can do.

Great, that's all I can ask.

thanks for the Oriole tickets.

Ben, who's in there with you?

00:59:09.343 --> 00:59:10.551
Hey.

1084
00:59:10.552 --> 00:59:12.345
Were you on the phone?

No.

1086
00:59:22.147 --> 00:59:24.357
My diagnosis, as I wrote,

1087
00:59:24.358 --> 00:59:26.484
is classic bipolar disorder.

1088
00:59:26.485 --> 00:59:28.486
Euphoric with schizoid tendencies.

1089
00:59:28.487 --> 00:59:31.530
[WHISPERS] See? I told you.

1090
00:59:31.531 --> 00:59:33.741
So in your assessment, Dr. Vincent,

1091
00:59:33.742 --> 00:59:35.993
you see Mr. Baker as being incapable

1092
00:59:35.994 --> 00:59:37.912
of understanding any consequences

1093
00:59:37.913 --> 00:59:39.038
for his actions.

1094
00:59:39.039 --> 00:59:40.748
Yes.

1095
00:59:40.749 --> 00:59:43.709
That is all we have
to say, Your Honor.


1096
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:45.378
Uh, Mr. Baker...

1097
00:59:45.379 --> 00:59:47.004
have you been having difficulty

1098
00:59:47.005 --> 00:59:48.756
distinguishing
between real and unreal?


1099
00:59:48.757 --> 00:59:51.009
My whole life.

1100
00:59:54.096 --> 00:59:56.347
This is a very serious diagnosis.

1101
00:59:56.348 --> 01:00:01.103
Would you describe him as a danger
to himself or to other people?


1102
01:00:02.062 --> 01:00:03.896
Actually, I would say no.

1103
01:00:03.897 --> 01:00:05.564
Not at this moment.

1104
01:00:05.565 --> 01:00:08.025
It is, of course,
completely possible.


1105
01:00:08.026 --> 01:00:09.860
Well, I'm prepared to rule on this.

1106
01:00:09.861 --> 01:00:11.779
Mr. Baker, Ms. Coulter,

1107
01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.407
I have to agree
with Dr. Vincent's finding


1108
01:00:14.408 --> 01:00:18.077
that Mr. Baker is... I'm sorry to talk
about you as though you weren't here,


1109
01:00:18.078 --> 01:00:20.913
but this 11-page handwritten brief

1110
01:00:20.914 --> 01:00:22.456

01:10:28.187 --> 01:10:30.981
but it's Annapolis,
not really even a city.


1271
01:10:30.982 --> 01:10:33.025
But why would I go with you?

1272
01:10:33.026 --> 01:10:35.235
What about dinner? Can I stay?

1273
01:10:35.236 --> 01:10:36.820
Can we think that far ahead?

1274
01:10:36.821 --> 01:10:38.238
What about your job?

1275
01:10:38.239 --> 01:10:40.240
I can't face doing the weather

1276
01:10:40.241 --> 01:10:43.535
in this completely
unadulterated, unpolluted state.


1277
01:10:43.536 --> 01:10:46.705
Plus, every time I leave here,
something terrible happens.


1278
01:10:46.706 --> 01:10:49.041
He's a grown man.

1279
01:10:49.042 --> 01:10:51.001
I mean, it's admirable, but...

1280
01:10:51.002 --> 01:10:53.503
I don't think the issues
of his life are your problem.


1281
01:10:53.504 --> 01:10:55.339
My problem? You just spent

1282
01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:57.257
the last five years
taking care of Methuselah.


1283
01:10:57.258 --> 01:10:58.842
We were married.

1284
01:10:58.843 --> 01:11:00.469
See, nobody believes in friendship.

1285
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:03.055
People talk about it.
You see it on TV.


1286
01:11:03.056 --> 01:11:06.266
People drop by and then
go to the doctor together.


1287
01:11:06.267 --> 01:11:07.893
No one eats alone.

1288
01:11:07.894 --> 01:11:11.938
But most people are alone.

1289
01:11:11.939 --> 01:11:13.774
That's the thing about friendship.

1290
01:11:13.775 --> 01:11:16.276
It's a lot rarer than love.

1291
01:11:16.277 --> 01:11:19.280
Because there's nothing
in it for anybody.


1292
01:11:21.908 --> 01:11:24.502
They're just two forms
of the same thing.


1293
01:11:28.039 --> 01:11:29.706
Don't you want me to stay for dinner?

1294
01:11:29.707 --> 01:11:31.041
I'll let you cook.

1295
01:11:31.042 --> 01:11:32.918
Just go easy on the sherry.

1296
01:11:32.919 --> 01:11:34.419
Remember our agreement.

1297
01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:36.513
We don't have an agreement.

1298
01:11:38.257 --> 01:11:39.466
Do you like chicken?

1299
01:11:39.467 --> 01:11:41.765
Like? Try love.

1300
01:11:47.934 --> 01:11:49.726
Go get one.

1301
01:11:49.727 --> 01:11:52.571
You want me to kill
someone at the store for it?


1302
01:11:53.856 --> 01:11:55.816
Are you kidding?

1303
01:11:55.817 --> 01:11:58.443
Come on, take it.

1304
01:11:58.444 --> 01:12:00.662
You want to be here? Be here.

1305
01:12:20.967 --> 01:12:23.390
It's like picking out a lobster.

1306
01:12:38.192 --> 01:12:40.160
Goddammit.

1307
01:13:03.926 --> 01:13:05.803
Shit.

1308
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:29.872
It's okay.

1309
01:13:31.454 --> 01:13:33.538
[WHISPERS] It's okay.

1310
01:13:33.539 --> 01:13:35.207
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1311
01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:37.167
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1312
01:13:37.168 --> 01:13:38.668
It's... it's all right.

1313
01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:40.421
It's going to be okay.

1314
01:13:43.216 --> 01:13:45.263
Who am I kidding?

1315
01:13:59.357 --> 01:14:01.358
Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.

1316
01:14:01.359 --> 01:14:02.692
I'm sorry.

1317
01:14:02.693 --> 01:14:04.528
Oh, fuck.

1318
01:14:04.529 --> 01:14:06.030
Shit.

1319
01:14:15.873 --> 01:14:18.046
Jesus...

1320
01:14:57.039 --> 01:14:59.041
Dinner.

1321
01:15:07.758 --> 01:15:08.925
Is that him?

1322
01:15:08.926 --> 01:15:10.343
Her.

1323
01:15:10.344 --> 01:15:12.721
Smells pretty good.

1324
01:15:15.516 --> 01:15:17.233
Hey, everybody.

1325
01:15:19.937 --> 01:15:22.940
I feel like we should
say grace or something.


1326
01:15:26.986 --> 01:15:28.445
Steve?

1327
01:15:28.446 --> 01:15:30.113
Fine, fine, I killed the chicken.

1328
01:15:30.114 --> 01:15:31.823
Am I supposed to feel bad about that?

1329
01:15:31.824 --> 01:15:33.199
People do it every day.

1330
01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.951
No, they really don't.

1331
01:15:34.952 --> 01:15:36.953
Well, then how am I supposed to feel?

1332
01:15:36.954 --> 01:15:38.997
I don't know.

1333
01:15:38.998 --> 01:15:40.715
Grateful, maybe?

1334
01:15:42.126 --> 01:15:43.627
Oh...

1335
01:15:52.011 --> 01:15:53.345
Right.

1336
01:15:53.346 --> 01:15:55.680
Um...

1337
01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:59.851
Thank you, God, and this chicken,

1338
01:15:59.852 --> 01:16:05.028
of course, who made
the ultimate sacrifice


1339
01:16:06.943 --> 01:16:11.154
in harm's way.

1340
01:16:11.155 --> 01:16:13.953
Uh, amen.

1341
01:16:14.992 --> 01:16:17.210
Great, let's eat.

1342
01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:21.127
Would you?

1343
01:16:31.008 --> 01:16:33.093
I thought I was going
to have a problem with this,


1344
01:16:33.094 --> 01:16:37.189
but damn, that's a juicy bird.

1345
01:16:38.557 --> 01:16:40.559
It does smell really good.

1346
01:16:45.272 --> 01:16:46.648
You want some?

1347
01:16:48.275 --> 01:16:51.528
Yeah, I think I do.

1348
01:17:12.675 --> 01:17:14.176
(STEVE) Ben?

1349
01:17:18.556 --> 01:17:21.024
Okay, you got my phone number.

1350
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:22.851
Oh...

1351
01:17:22.852 --> 01:17:25.061
Here, take it. 
It's my last one.

1352
01:17:25.062 --> 01:17:26.730
I'm going to lay off for a while.

1353
01:17:26.731 --> 01:17:28.773
What am I going
to do with one joint?

1354
01:17:28.774 --> 01:17:30.900
Better try and get by,
but when I come back,


1355
01:17:30.901 --> 01:17:33.695
I'm bringing you the biggest
bag of dope you've ever seen.


1356
01:17:33.696 --> 01:17:36.239
- I don't think so.
- Okay, maybe you've seen a bigger one.


1357
01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:38.074
But I'm bringing a lot.

1358
01:17:38.075 --> 01:17:40.577
Do what you want. I don't
know where I'll be.


1359
01:17:40.578 --> 01:17:42.704
That's kind of ominous.

1360
01:17:42.705 --> 01:17:44.748
And because
of its non sequitur nature,


1361
01:17:44.749 --> 01:17:46.750
I'm going to take that
as a yes on the weed.


1362
01:17:46.751 --> 01:17:49.544
Why don't you take
all of this as clarity?


1363
01:17:49.545 --> 01:17:51.212
You don't have to come back, okay?

1364
01:17:51.213 --> 01:17:53.089
Suddenly you're going
to get your own weed?


1365
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:54.632
Look, I'm done. That's it. It's over.

1366
01:17:54.633 --> 01:17:56.968
What are you talking about?

1367
01:17:56.969 --> 01:18:00.096
I'm talking about, we took this ski
lift to the top of the mountain.


1368
01:18:00.097 --> 01:18:02.974
We got off. You're going one
way, and I'm going the other.


1369
01:18:02.975 --> 01:18:05.310
There's only one way to go, down.

1370
01:18:05.311 --> 01:18:06.853
You can't get on the lift without me.

1371
01:18:06.854 --> 01:18:08.563
In fact, you can't even ski.

1372
01:18:08.564 --> 01:18:10.690
- I can ski.
- When have you been skiing?


1373
01:18:10.691 --> 01:18:13.276
You told that girl you could
ski and I backed you up on it,


1374
01:18:13.277 --> 01:18:14.944
but you'd never been skiing.

1375
01:18:14.945 --> 01:18:16.488
Then you told her
you'd never been skiing,


1376
01:18:16.489 --> 01:18:18.364
and you sold me out, remember?

1377
01:18:18.365 --> 01:18:20.825
Forget about skiing.
You're talking stupid shit.


1378
01:18:20.826 --> 01:18:22.994
I need you to take this
seriously for once.


1379
01:18:22.995 --> 01:18:24.329
Take something seriously!

1380
01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:25.955
Oh, I get it.

1381
01:18:25.956 --> 01:18:27.832
You're strong. 
All has been revealed.

1382
01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:29.459
I'm just saying this is my problem,

1383
01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:31.002
and you're exacerbating it.

1384
01:18:31.003 --> 01:18:33.296
You are truly batshit.

1385
01:18:33.297 --> 01:18:35.757
I'm sure it's scary to take fixing
me off your list of things to do,


1386
01:18:35.758 --> 01:18:37.342
because all that's left
is fixing you.


1387
01:18:37.343 --> 01:18:38.676
Oh, wow.

1388
01:18:38.677 --> 01:18:40.345
Thank you for that.

1389
01:18:40.346 --> 01:18:42.013
Yeah, 'cause I'm
the selfish one here.


1390
01:18:42.014 --> 01:18:43.932
There's no chance you're the asshole.

1391
01:18:43.933 --> 01:18:47.477
Look, you don't know me,
and you don't owe me, okay?


1392
01:18:47.478 --> 01:18:51.147
Well, if you feel the need to punch
me in the balls knock yourself out.


1393
01:18:51.148 --> 01:18:55.949
I'll try to clear my schedule for the
next time the clarity wears off.


1394
01:19:02.451 --> 01:19:03.785
Are you going?

1395
01:19:03.786 --> 01:19:05.161
Yeah, I got to get back.

1396
01:19:05.162 --> 01:19:06.663
Oh.

1397
01:19:06.664 --> 01:19:09.165
I got the job, you know.

1398
01:19:09.166 --> 01:19:12.001
No, of course.

1399
01:19:12.002 --> 01:19:13.670
You don't want to
walk me to the car?

1400
01:19:13.671 --> 01:19:15.630
Well, if you're leaving,
you're leaving.


1401
01:19:15.631 --> 01:19:17.173
I mean, I can call you or something.

1402
01:19:17.174 --> 01:19:18.842
Well, do you not want me to go?

1403
01:19:18.843 --> 01:19:21.344
Well, it's not going to be easy here.

1404
01:19:21.345 --> 01:19:23.847
And not because I'm pining for you.

1405
01:19:23.848 --> 01:19:26.683
I mean, you know
I'm not going to leave.


1406
01:19:26.684 --> 01:19:30.154
You're counting on it,
so really, you're just using me.


1407
01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:33.022
And throw in the fact that...

1408
01:19:33.023 --> 01:19:34.858
maybe I do have feelings.

1409
01:19:34.859 --> 01:19:36.901
Oh, God, so do I.

1410
01:19:36.902 --> 01:19:41.072
No... half a day sobriety
isn't going to open that door.


1411
01:19:41.073 --> 01:19:43.700
Oh, you can still
walk me outside, you know.


1412
01:19:43.701 --> 01:19:45.577
No funny business, I promise.

1413
01:19:45.578 --> 01:19:47.328
You should go.

1414
01:19:47.329 --> 01:19:49.080
I'll stay here until I feel
okay about going.


1415
01:19:49.081 --> 01:19:51.549
So you can feel okay about going.

1416
01:20:15.357 --> 01:20:17.400
Now, about this tropical depression

1417
01:20:17.401 --> 01:20:19.360
brewing off the Florida Keys,

1418
01:20:19.361 --> 01:20:22.280
it's too early to tell if
this Gulf air will hold


1419
01:20:22.281 --> 01:20:24.449
and create hurricane conditions.

1420
01:20:24.450 --> 01:20:27.544
So Victoria, we will
keep an eye on that.


1421
01:20:28.245 --> 01:20:29.454
Thank you, Steve.

1422
01:20:29.455 --> 01:20:31.753
We certainly will.

1423
01:20:33.417 --> 01:20:35.544
State officials announced today...

1424
01:20:37.671 --> 01:20:40.089
Dallas? Steve Dallas?

1425
01:20:40.090 --> 01:20:41.758
Yes, mein fuhrer...

1426
01:20:41.759 --> 01:20:43.593
You know, for a second out there,

1427
01:20:43.594 --> 01:20:45.887
I thought you were sober.

1428
01:20:45.888 --> 01:20:48.431
Then I realized you're probably on
some drug I've never even heard of.


1429
01:20:48.432 --> 01:20:50.266
Look at this shit.

1430
01:20:50.267 --> 01:20:52.602
Why don't they get us tubes,
like astronauts?


1431
01:20:52.603 --> 01:20:55.104
I don't know. The sandwiches
are pretty good.


1432
01:20:55.105 --> 01:20:56.940
Chicken baloney?

1433
01:20:56.941 --> 01:20:58.775
Do you have any idea
where that even comes from?


1434
01:20:58.776 --> 01:21:01.152
Yeah, a chicken.

1435
01:21:01.153 --> 01:21:03.371
It's a lot harder than that.

1436
01:21:09.245 --> 01:21:11.287
I didn't know you painted.

1437

I don't really.

1438
01:21:14.083 --> 01:21:15.917
But somehow, tracing these lines

1439
01:21:15.918 --> 01:21:17.794
is really going to help me
remember this place.

'Cause let's face it,
the next time I come back

it probably won't be here.

1442
01:21:20.673 --> 01:21:22.800
Thanks for cheering me up.

1443

Try it.

1444
01:21:36.272 --> 01:21:38.982
I really screwed up.

1445
01:21:38.983 --> 01:21:41.406
It wasn't in your control.

1446

Gauguin packed up as far
from this craphole as possible.

The world wasn't even one
tenth as polluted as it is now.

You feel like packing up?

No.

I don't even feel that.

1451

I just feel like...

1452
01:22:03.173 --> 01:22:05.675
it's a pretty nice day, and...

1453
01:22:05.676 --> 01:22:08.679
I hate myself for being the guy
who only has that to say.


1454

Need another club soda, Mr. Dallas?

1455

Does anyone ever need
another club soda?


1456
01:22:28.699 --> 01:22:30.533
What's going on here?

1457
01:22:30.534 --> 01:22:32.368
Oh, a real estate seminar.

1458

Lot of ladies trying
to change their lives.

Is it good?

1460
01:23:00.230 --> 01:23:04.067
It's filled with bizarre details
and super weird bullshit.


1461
01:23:04.068 --> 01:23:07.071
You've never read anything
you liked that was like that?


1462
01:23:07.654 --> 01:23:09.197
It was not me.

1463
01:23:09.198 --> 01:23:11.199
Actually, it was me.

1464
01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.576
That's what makes it so depressing.
Now it's just this.

Unfinished, unfocused, unrelenting.

I'm a guy in a desert that's
running towards a mirage.

I'm still really thirsty,
and my mouth is full of sand.

I don't think it's mine.

It's going to take time.

I just wish it was some
crippling depression

instead of this disappointment.

How do you all live
here without looking

for a high place to jump from?

And it's overwhelming.

1484
01:24:21.979 --> 01:24:24.313
I wasted so much.

1485
01:24:24.314 --> 01:24:26.315
I gobbled it all down

show up so we could have a fight.

think that... even through all this,


1499
01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:58.301
that what Dad wanted was for us
to deal with all this together.

only one sentence away

from telling me you
want to turn the store

of my limitations.

And I guess what I'm saying is

1509
01:27:19.072 --> 01:27:21.490
is that whatever you have in mind

1510
01:27:21.491 --> 01:27:22.700
I'm okay with it.

Well, I've been
tossing around the idea

of converting the store
into something more modern.

Yeah, I know she has some freaky
power over all the men in my family.

And that probably comes
from under her sundress.

Okay.

of undeveloped land.

to track this storm

about to make landfall
just south of Charleston here.

Expect 85 mile-per-hour winds

01:29:40.505 --> 01:29:42.423
Local people are interested.

1564
01:29:42.424 --> 01:29:44.300
They might run us national

in Baltimore snake us again.

him in his madras shorts.


1569
01:30:02.986 --> 01:30:05.821
Would have felt more like a vacation.

1570
01:30:05.822 --> 01:30:07.823
I talked to Terri like you suggested.

1571
01:30:07.824 --> 01:30:09.158
It wasn't bad, right?

1572
01:30:09.159 --> 01:30:10.326
It was great.

1573
01:30:10.327 --> 01:30:12.453
And um...

1574
01:30:12.454 --> 01:30:14.331
the other night, too.

1575
01:30:15.749 --> 01:30:17.666
That really happened, didn't it?

1576
01:30:17.667 --> 01:30:19.376
Yes.

1577
01:30:19.377 --> 01:30:21.045
Yes, it did.

I can't tell you how much that meant.

1579

Well, someone had to welcome
you back to the world.

How did you end up with my dad?

Uh... I guess it was all this.

1582
01:30:40.315 --> 01:30:45.321
It's hard to resist the temptation
to step into a normal life.


1583
01:30:46.822 --> 01:30:48.864
I know you told my dad
you didn't want anything.


1584
01:30:48.865 --> 01:30:50.825
Yeah, I said that.

01:30:50.826 --> 01:30:53.536
And I really meant it, but...

1586
01:30:53.537 --> 01:30:56.831
you think he would just give
me like one little thing.


1587
01:30:56.832 --> 01:31:00.376
Anything, just for
sentimental reasons,


1588
01:31:00.377 --> 01:31:02.044
a gesture.

1589
01:31:02.045 --> 01:31:04.046
Well, you deserve whatever you want.

1590
01:31:04.047 --> 01:31:05.506
I keep trying to find a way...

1591
01:31:05.507 --> 01:31:08.551
No, no, no. Not from you.

1592
01:31:08.552 --> 01:31:11.305
I mean, it's sweet. 
Thank you, but...

1593
01:31:12.347 --> 01:31:14.723
it's not the same.

1594
01:31:14.724 --> 01:31:17.643
I thought since, you know, you didn't
know what you were going to do


1595
01:31:17.644 --> 01:31:20.062
that you could talk to Steve
about the farm and the house.


1596
01:31:20.063 --> 01:31:22.106
I'm sure he doesn't know
what he's going to do either.


1597
01:31:22.107 --> 01:31:23.607
What do you mean?

1598
01:31:23.608 --> 01:31:26.202
I'm giving this all to Dallas.

1599
01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:28.445
What?

1600
01:31:28.446 --> 01:31:30.948
I promised it to him after the will.

1601
01:31:30.949 --> 01:31:32.996
Huh.

1602
01:31:34.369 --> 01:31:36.203
I didn't know that.

1603
01:31:36.204 --> 01:31:38.122
It's an odd marriage,
but I kind of owed it to him.


1604
01:31:38.123 --> 01:31:41.593
- Why, did you want it?
- No, mm-mm.


1605
01:31:42.335 --> 01:31:43.419
Are you okay?

1606
01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:46.630
Sure. You?

1607
01:31:46.631 --> 01:31:49.725
Yeah, Terri's going to help
me find a smaller place.


1608
01:31:52.888 --> 01:31:55.937
I'll never forget how you
held this family together.


1609
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:17.119
It's me. I hope I'm using this right.

1610
01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:19.079
It keeps asking me to press star,

1611
01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:21.624
which I don't think
we have on this phone.


1612
01:32:21.625 --> 01:32:23.083
Oh, there it is.

1613
01:32:23.084 --> 01:32:26.629
Uh, listen man...
[BEEP]


1614
01:32:26.630 --> 01:32:27.963
Listen, man,
I know we haven't talked.


1615
01:32:27.964 --> 01:32:29.924
I'm just going to say it.

1616
01:32:29.925 --> 01:32:32.343
I miss you, and I've been
thinking about things


1617
01:32:32.344 --> 01:32:34.136
and I want to make good on things.

1618
01:32:34.137 --> 01:32:38.974
And I know Angela miss...
[BEEP]


1619
01:32:38.975 --> 01:32:40.935
Okay, now I've got to talk fast,
because if I stop talking


1620
01:32:40.936 --> 01:32:42.561
the thing will cut me off.

1621
01:32:42.562 --> 01:32:43.938
Come down if you're ever free

1622
01:32:43.939 --> 01:32:45.816
and I'm good, bye.

1623
01:32:49.277 --> 01:32:51.279
Hello?

1624
01:32:53.573 --> 01:32:56.533
Morning, slugger.
Four reports in six hours.


1625
01:32:56.534 --> 01:32:58.494
Station manager's wet dream.

1626
01:32:58.495 --> 01:33:00.788
You got two hours to get
cleaned up for your 12:30.


1627
01:33:00.789 --> 01:33:04.059
- That's it. I'm done.
- What?


1628
01:33:04.059 --> 01:33:07.169
I think it's time you find a
new entertainment reporter,


1629
01:33:07.170 --> 01:33:09.296
someone who's comfortable with...

1630
01:33:09.297 --> 01:33:10.965
what a waste of time this is,

1631
01:33:10.966 --> 01:33:12.683
someone who isn't aware
of the fact that


1632
01:33:12.684 --> 01:33:15.886
any six year old can stick
their arm out the window


1633
01:33:15.887 --> 01:33:18.889
and tell you what it's
going to be like today.


1634
01:33:18.890 --> 01:33:22.476
Dave, I would like to introduce you

1635
01:33:22.477 --> 01:33:25.521
to Delia, an actual meteorologist

1636
01:33:25.522 --> 01:33:27.856
and yeah, she doesn't
look like Miss America.


1637
01:33:27.857 --> 01:33:30.192
She looks like someone
who went to MIT,


1638
01:33:30.193 --> 01:33:31.735
because she did.

1639
01:33:31.736 --> 01:33:33.529
Can't you ever just make it easy?

1640
01:33:33.530 --> 01:33:36.907
Do you have to suck
the good out of everything?


1641
01:33:36.908 --> 01:33:38.705
Good luck, sweetheart.

1642
01:33:42.956 --> 01:33:44.833
He kissed me.

1643
01:34:11.317 --> 01:34:13.235
Amish Farms Superstore?

1644
01:34:13.236 --> 01:34:15.404
Yes, but without the question mark.

1645
01:34:15.405 --> 01:34:17.281
If you believed in anything,

1646
01:34:17.282 --> 01:34:19.950
you would realize this is
why people go to hell.


1647
01:34:19.951 --> 01:34:21.285
Have you talked to Ben?

1648
01:34:21.286 --> 01:34:22.578
Ben agreed to this?

1649
01:34:22.579 --> 01:34:23.954
Underground parking?

1650
01:34:23.955 --> 01:34:25.372
Honestly, we spoke,

1651
01:34:25.373 --> 01:34:28.459
in rational means as a family and
this was the decision that we made.


1652
01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:29.960
And luckily for the both of us

1653
01:34:29.961 --> 01:34:31.545
you're not part of the family.

1654
01:34:31.546 --> 01:34:33.213
No, no, congratulations. You won.

1655
01:34:33.214 --> 01:34:34.715
And I don't mean
the battle over the will.


1656
01:34:34.716 --> 01:34:36.592
I mean for biggest twat of the year.

1657
01:34:36.593 --> 01:34:39.386
Boy, you really don't know
how to talk to a woman


1658
01:34:39.387 --> 01:34:40.971
you're not trying to screw.

1659
01:34:40.972 --> 01:34:42.639
Ben and I reconciled,

1660
01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:44.558
and your opposition
to that makes me feel


1661
01:34:44.559 --> 01:34:46.268
like you just don't want to be alone

1662
01:34:46.269 --> 01:34:48.479
in whatever weed-powered dance

1663
01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:51.065
you two have shared
for the last 25 years.


1664
01:34:51.066 --> 01:34:52.983
I want him to get better.

1665
01:34:52.984 --> 01:34:56.153
Then for once, leave him be.

1666
01:34:56.154 --> 01:34:59.490
He is going to have
a lifetime of prosperity.


1667
01:34:59.491 --> 01:35:02.710
And I'm sure he and Angela
will be very happy.


1668
01:35:03.036 --> 01:35:04.870
What?

1669
01:35:04.871 --> 01:35:07.289
Maybe it's sick, but those
two found each other.


1670
01:35:07.290 --> 01:35:10.459
I know it sounds weird,
but I actually believe


1671
01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:12.169
that my brother and my stepmother

1672
01:35:12.170 --> 01:35:13.670
belong together.

1673
01:35:13.671 --> 01:35:16.840
Wait, they're together? Says who?

1674
01:35:16.841 --> 01:35:20.010
Oh, Steve, they are.

1675
01:35:20.011 --> 01:35:22.012
Sorry, you're going to have
to find someone else


1676
01:35:22.013 --> 01:35:23.680
who's in worse shape than you now.

1677
01:35:23.681 --> 01:35:26.149
- Go fuck yourself.
- Go fuck yourself, too.


1678
01:35:34.150 --> 01:35:35.692
- Beard.
- Yeah.


1679
01:35:35.693 --> 01:35:37.528
- You like it?
- Is Angela here?


1680
01:35:37.529 --> 01:35:39.530
I don't know if you got my messages.

1681
01:35:39.531 --> 01:35:41.365
I wanted you to come so I
could tell you the great news


1682
01:35:41.366 --> 01:35:43.283
that the farm is yours

1683
01:35:43.284 --> 01:35:45.369
- to do whatever you want with.
- Fan-fucking-tastic.


1684
01:35:45.370 --> 01:35:46.537
Angela around?

1685
01:35:46.538 --> 01:35:49.990
Now, don't be mad, but Terri's
going to get the store.


1686
01:35:49.991 --> 01:35:52.626
- It's just the best way to go.
- That is great, great news.


1687
01:35:52.627 --> 01:35:53.877
Do you know where Angela is?

1688
01:35:53.878 --> 01:35:56.639
Are you okay?
I think she's upstairs.


1689
01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:00.400
- Upstairs where you were just screwing her?
- What are you talking about?


1690
01:36:00.402 --> 01:36:02.177
I don't know if you
were just screwing her.


1691
01:36:02.178 --> 01:36:03.679
That's a weird thing to say.

1692
01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:06.148
Really? Because it is sick.

1693
01:36:08.143 --> 01:36:10.686
If it isn't Amish country's
own Mary Magdalene.


1694
01:36:10.687 --> 01:36:12.163
Did you wash his feet first

1695
01:36:12.164 --> 01:36:14.398
or just pull him down off
the cross and bone him?


1696
01:36:14.399 --> 01:36:16.066
- Hold on. Calm down.
- What?


1697
01:36:16.067 --> 01:36:17.818
- You're being very...
- No, stay out of this.


1698
01:36:17.819 --> 01:36:19.361
I'm warning you, Ben.
Stay out of this.


1699
01:36:19.362 --> 01:36:20.863
Why are you angry?

1700
01:36:20.864 --> 01:36:22.406
Because you fucked my friend.

1701
01:36:22.407 --> 01:36:24.908
- Who told you that?
- Everybody knows.


1702
01:36:24.909 --> 01:36:26.577
That's none of your business.

1703
01:36:26.578 --> 01:36:28.036
I guess nothing
was none of my business.


1704
01:36:28.037 --> 01:36:31.748
I never promised you anything. You got
the farm. Isn't that what you wanted?


1705
01:36:31.749 --> 01:36:34.522
Stop it! I'm not going to have the two
people I care about most in the world


1706
01:36:34.523 --> 01:36:38.422
fight like this. You got it
all wrong. Now cool it.


1707
01:36:38.423 --> 01:36:41.142
Fine, fine.

1708
01:36:44.804 --> 01:36:46.351
What happened?

1709
01:36:55.023 --> 01:36:58.233
Oh, God. This is so bad.

1710
01:36:58.234 --> 01:37:02.112
You assholes, both of you.
Such assholes.


1711
01:37:02.113 --> 01:37:05.949
You don't care about anything. Jesus,
you know what she means to me.


1712
01:37:05.950 --> 01:37:08.035
It's not what you think.

1713
01:37:08.036 --> 01:37:10.454
I-I didn't know, but it doesn't
change anything, I swear.


1714
01:37:10.455 --> 01:37:12.206
The hell it doesn't!

1715
01:37:12.207 --> 01:37:14.082
I thought I meant something to you.

1716
01:37:14.083 --> 01:37:16.210
Because I thought you
were helping a sick friend,


1717
01:37:16.211 --> 01:37:17.920
not making a real estate deal.

1718
01:37:17.921 --> 01:37:19.630
What? I was!

1719
01:37:19.631 --> 01:37:21.590
But aren't I entitled to something?

1720
01:37:21.591 --> 01:37:23.467
Yes!

1721
01:37:23.468 --> 01:37:25.302
You don't know where I have been,

1722
01:37:25.303 --> 01:37:28.556
the shit I have done to deserve you.

1723
01:37:41.110 --> 01:37:42.986
I talked to Terri...

1724
01:37:42.987 --> 01:37:45.956
and it's yours to do
whatever you want with it.


1725
01:37:47.033 --> 01:37:50.494
And... don't know
what to say except...


1726
01:37:50.495 --> 01:37:52.120
I hope you take a look at yourself...

1727
01:37:52.121 --> 01:37:54.248
and realize how much is there.

1728
01:37:55.667 --> 01:37:57.334
Steve...

1729
01:37:57.335 --> 01:37:59.678
you got to get your shit together.

1730
01:38:07.595 --> 01:38:11.348
I hope one day you find out
what you really care about.


1731
01:38:11.349 --> 01:38:13.267
I hope one day you learn
to solve a problem


1732
01:38:13.268 --> 01:38:16.144
without sleeping with it.

1733
01:38:16.145 --> 01:38:19.022
What happened between me and
Ben had nothing to do with you


1734
01:38:19.023 --> 01:38:20.816
or my feelings for you.

1735
01:38:20.817 --> 01:38:23.235
Oh, come on. You sell
all this nature shit


1736
01:38:23.236 --> 01:38:25.445
and honesty and feelings,

1737
01:38:25.446 --> 01:38:28.407
when you're just this empty little
girl with no responsibilities
