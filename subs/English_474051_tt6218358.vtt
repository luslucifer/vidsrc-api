1
00:01:35.175 --> 00:01:37.625
Don't go.

2
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.180
I have to go. I promised him.

3
00:01:41.717 --> 00:01:44.127
Now promise me
you'll look after yourself.


4
00:01:44.258 --> 00:01:45.718
Yeah.

5
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.590
I'm going hunting. I love you.

6
00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:57.505
I love you too.

7
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.880
- Go.
- I don't wanna go.


8
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.430
- Hurry up.
- Nice to see you too, mate.


9
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.010
Amazing news, by the way.
Congratulations.


10
00:02:24.175 --> 00:02:27.965
Thanks, Marcus. 
It's pretty crazy, eh?

11
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.130
Pretty crazy.

12
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.260
- You okay?
- Mmm.


13
00:02:35.425 --> 00:02:37.425
- Will you be alright?
- Well, yeah.


14
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.590
- Sure?
- Yep.


15
00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:39.675
Yeah.

16
00:02:49.758 --> 00:02:51.878
So I guess you finally had sex
with a woman.


17
00:02:51.967 --> 00:02:55.427
Yes, yes, and... and she was...
she was awake.


18
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.300
- Yeah.
- That's a first.


19
00:02:58.383 --> 00:03:02.593
I know. I'm sorry. I know you always
wanted to be the one I got pregnant.


20
00:03:02.675 --> 00:03:07.295
Well, you might wanna double-check the
child doesn't come out looking like me.


21
00:03:07.383 --> 00:03:11.183
So how you been?
All this baby shit. It must be mad.


22
00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:15.468
Yeah, it is, man. It's insane.
It's fucking surreal.


23
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.840
I'll actually forget
that she's pregnant.


24
00:03:17.967 --> 00:03:19.797
It freaks me out every time I remember.

25
00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:22.183
- It's insane.
- Oh, my God, man, I bet.


26
00:03:22.342 --> 00:03:25.092
- Yeah, yeah.
- Rather you than me, my friend.


27
00:03:25.217 --> 00:03:29.047
But, you know... 
I am pleased for you.

28
00:03:30.258 --> 00:03:32.968
Thanks, man. It's good to see you.

29
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.090
You too, man. You too.

30
00:04:00.717 --> 00:04:03.757
- Bloody hell, man.
- Amazing, right?


31
00:04:03.883 --> 00:04:04.933
Yeah.

32
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.260
The old man used to bring me here
hunting when I was a kid.


33
00:04:09.508 --> 00:04:11.588
Gunn's Wood.

34
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.800
Reckon you can take down a deer?

35
00:04:14.883 --> 00:04:18.303
No. Probably not, no.

36
00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.513
Not everyone can do it.

37
00:04:21.592 --> 00:04:24.512
The trick is you have to switch off
your emotions, let instinct kick in.


38
00:04:24.633 --> 00:04:27.013
It's never seemed very fair to me, man,
shooting a deer.


39
00:04:27.175 --> 00:04:30.925
Well, life's not fair, Vaughn.
We learned that at school.


40
00:04:32.842 --> 00:04:35.802
Yeah, but we were 12, weren't we?

41
00:04:36.842 --> 00:04:39.382
This is it, Vaughny-boy,
the last few days of your freedom.


42
00:04:39.467 --> 00:04:43.177
- You have to enjoy it, man.
- I'm sorry. I know. It'll be fun.


43
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.380
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Freya.


44
00:05:25.467 --> 00:05:28.177
Marcus Trenton and Vaughn Carter?
Three nights?


45
00:05:28.258 --> 00:05:30.718
- That's right, yes.
- Yep.


46
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.970
Addresses and phone numbers
in the book, please.


47
00:05:34.092 --> 00:05:35.132
Hey, wee man.

48
00:05:38.925 --> 00:05:41.245
It's quiet enough, isn't it?
Must all kick off around ten.


49
00:05:57.592 --> 00:06:02.302
So this is where they all hide.
Get a drink. I'm going for a slash.


50
00:06:09.675 --> 00:06:13.085
- How are you?
- Not bad. How you doing?


51
00:06:13.258 --> 00:06:16.878
I'm good. I, uh...
I hear that you're stalking.


52
00:06:16.967 --> 00:06:19.427
- Stalking?
- Aye, well, hunting.


53
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.760
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, we are, yeah.
It's not really my thing.


54
00:06:22.925 --> 00:06:27.675
It's my friend's gig, really.
He gave me a gun, got me a license.


55
00:06:27.758 --> 00:06:31.088
- Well, you know how to handle a gun?
- Yeah, yeah.


56
00:06:31.217 --> 00:06:34.797
I did a bit of shooting on a range
when I was at school, so yeah.


57
00:06:34.883 --> 00:06:37.933
Yeah, we haven't had so many folks
stalking this last season.


58
00:06:38.008 --> 00:06:41.378
There's a massive country club
opened 50 miles off.


59
00:06:41.508 --> 00:06:43.428
It drained a lot of our trade.

60
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.510
I think my friend's made a point
of avoiding that place, so don't worry.


61
00:06:46.592 --> 00:06:49.952
Aye? Oh, good for him. I'm Logan, by the way.
- Vaughn. Nice to meet you. - And you.


62
00:06:51.758 --> 00:06:54.508
Oh, Marcus. This is Logan.

63
00:06:54.633 --> 00:06:56.843
Hey. Good to meet you.

64
00:06:56.967 --> 00:07:00.627
I hear that you lads might need
a ghillie out there with you tomorrow.


65
00:07:00.717 --> 00:07:02.127
Oh, no. We'll be stalking alone.

66
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.220
It's all cleared with Lord Griffin.
My father knew him, so...


67
00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:08.933
Two pints of IPA, please,
two Laphroaigs and...


68
00:07:09.008 --> 00:07:12.088
- Can I get you a drink, Logan?
- Oh, no. I'm alright, thanks.


69
00:07:14.592 --> 00:07:18.802
You, uh... Well, you boys have
a good day's hunting out there, eh?


70
00:07:18.883 --> 00:07:20.593
We will.

71
00:07:26.217 --> 00:07:28.967
What? He'd have rattled on for hours.

72
00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:33.507
What did you say? 
What did you say?

73
00:07:33.592 --> 00:07:36.932
- Shut the fuck up.
- Straight to his face, man.


74
00:07:37.008 --> 00:07:39.758
Oh, the memory's still etched
in my mind.


75
00:07:39.842 --> 00:07:42.012
Nobody tried that
with the field marshal. Nobody.


76
00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:45.013
Fucking deserved it. The way
he used to talk to you, it wound me up.


77
00:07:45.092 --> 00:07:46.592
Loyal to the end, Vaughny-boy.

78
00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:49.755
In that case, borderline insane,
but, you know...


79
00:07:50.467 --> 00:07:52.087
God, he could be a mean old bastard.

80
00:07:52.258 --> 00:07:54.128
Yeah. Yeah, he could.

81
00:07:55.092 --> 00:07:56.222
You miss him?

82
00:07:57.342 --> 00:08:01.342
No, man, no. It's been...
It's been three years, you know.


83
00:08:03.008 --> 00:08:05.088
Yeah, fuck him.

84
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.180
Oh, my God. Kara, you can't say that.

85
00:08:18.425 --> 00:08:20.505
Any chance of a drink?

86
00:08:22.008 --> 00:08:25.218
- Yeah, definitely.
- Two double whisky and cokes.


87
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.430
I'm Kara. This is Iona.

88
00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:31.433
- Do you wanna get that?
- I'll get these, yes.


89
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.800
Uh, Marcus, Vaughn.

90
00:08:35.758 --> 00:08:37.428
You alright, mate?

91
00:08:38.925 --> 00:08:41.609
- What the fuck you playing at?
- Jesus Christ. Take it fucking easy.


92
00:08:41.633 --> 00:08:44.433
Take your hands off my friend, big man.

93
00:08:44.508 --> 00:08:47.008
I'll knock you on your arse,
you fucking flash prick.


94
00:08:47.092 --> 00:08:50.382
- Will you, now?
- Alright, Donald, that's enough.


95
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.180
Sit down, son.

96
00:09:00.467 --> 00:09:03.007
Enjoy your night.

97
00:09:04.467 --> 00:09:07.047
- I had that covered, man.
- Yeah, sure you did.


98
00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:11.927
- Sorry.
- It's alright.


99
00:09:12.008 --> 00:09:15.878
Two double whiskeys and cokes
and two IPAs, please.


100
00:09:15.967 --> 00:09:17.757
Keep an eye on your friend, huh?

101
00:09:22.175 --> 00:09:24.925
You guys picked
the perfect weekend to be here.


102
00:09:25.008 --> 00:09:27.548
- Oh, yeah? Why?
- Alban Eiler.


103
00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:30.053
Alban... Alban, what?

104
00:09:32.383 --> 00:09:34.933
- Alban Eiler.
- Oh, right, Alban Eiler.


105
00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:38.625
It's this big festival thing
on Sunday night.


106
00:09:38.717 --> 00:09:42.047
- The weekend gets boozy as hell.
- Oh, cool.


107
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:51.340
Whoa. Do yourself a favor.
Steer clear of that wee lassie.


108
00:09:52.883 --> 00:09:54.383
What if I don't?

109
00:09:54.508 --> 00:09:59.428
Just offering some friendly advice,
pal. It's your funeral.


110
00:10:09.258 --> 00:10:10.508
Fucking...

111
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.590

122
00:11:01.842 --> 00:11:03.932
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

123
00:11:06.383 --> 00:11:08.973
- Kara, shall we?
- Come on, then.


124
00:11:09.092 --> 00:11:11.222
Enjoy your night.

125
00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:20.222
- Marcus seems wild.
- Yeah, he is.


126
00:11:20.383 --> 00:11:22.593
- How long have you known him?
- Marcus?


127
00:11:24.175 --> 00:11:26.255
15 years.

128
00:11:29.758 --> 00:11:34.008
Met him at boarding school.
He kind of took me under his wing.


129
00:11:34.175 --> 00:11:36.755
I haven't really been able
to get rid of him since.


130
00:11:36.883 --> 00:11:39.883
- You went to boarding school?
- Yeah.


131
00:11:40.008 --> 00:11:42.008
- You did?
- Yeah.


132
00:11:43.425 --> 00:11:45.425
Why did you go there?

133
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:49.300
Parents went to work abroad when
I was 12, so they chucked me in there.


134
00:11:49.467 --> 00:11:52.177
- Wow. That's pretty harsh.
- Yeah.


135
00:11:54.258 --> 00:11:56.128
Yeah, it is harsh.

136
00:11:56.217 --> 00:11:57.547
Fuckers.

137
00:12:09.383 --> 00:12:13.473
I've got a fiancée, and she's pregnant.

138
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.880
Iona.

139
00:12:26.425 --> 00:12:28.965
- I'm sorry. Listen, I should have...
- Listen, no.


140
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.010
- I should have said. I should...
- Listen.


141
00:12:31.133 --> 00:12:33.803
I have had a fucking boring week.

142
00:12:37.342 --> 00:12:41.592
My mum owns the inn.
And I have the bar keys.


143
00:12:43.175 --> 00:12:45.295
Just come and have a drink with me.

144
00:12:47.008 --> 00:12:49.088
- Yeah?
- Of course.


145
00:12:50.842 --> 00:12:52.552
Okay.

146
00:12:58.175 --> 00:13:00.965
- So you grew up here?
- Yep.


147
00:13:04.592 --> 00:13:08.762
I should probably think about leaving
soon, though, before it's too late.


148
00:13:08.883 --> 00:13:11.303
I don't know.
I think it's quite cool. I like it.


149
00:13:11.383 --> 00:13:14.593
- Try living here.
- This is true.


150
00:13:16.508 --> 00:13:18.798
So, how are you feeling
about being a dad?


151
00:13:18.925 --> 00:13:21.005
I don't know.

152
00:13:22.883 --> 00:13:25.633
I mean, it's fucking terrifying. It's...

153
00:13:25.758 --> 00:13:28.008
Yeah, course it is.

154
00:13:30.258 --> 00:13:32.628
No, I think you'll be okay.

155
00:13:32.758 --> 00:13:34.428
I hope so.

156
00:13:35.467 --> 00:13:37.217
Cheers.

157
00:13:48.592 --> 00:13:50.182
Rise and shine.

158
00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.680
Come on, Vaughn. Get up!

159
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.550
We're late.

160
00:13:54.633 --> 00:13:58.223
Morning. Come on, Vaughn.
Hop to it. We're late.


161
00:13:59.967 --> 00:14:02.047
Get up.

162
00:14:21.425 --> 00:14:24.585
Someone crept back
suspiciously late last night.


163
00:14:24.675 --> 00:14:28.005
Nothing fucking happened, man, okay?
So just shut up.


164
00:14:28.092 --> 00:14:31.472
Just... I'm just hungover.

165
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.630
I mean, how come you're so fresh?

166
00:14:34.633 --> 00:14:37.013
Oh, you're not sniffing
that shit again, are you?


167
00:14:37.133 --> 00:14:40.223
I didn't smoke. I told you, smoking
gives you hangovers, not alcohol.


168
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.050
Jesus, man,
I thought you quit that stuff.


169
00:14:42.175 --> 00:14:43.875
I'm on my holidays.

170
00:15:18.383 --> 00:15:20.883
Jesus Christ, mate. 
You look like shit.

171
00:15:21.758 --> 00:15:23.838
Can you just do me a favor
and just shoot me?


172
00:15:23.967 --> 00:15:26.717
Here. Take a shot of this.

173
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.880
- Oh, fuck. I've forgotten the ammo.
- You're joking me.


174
00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.970
We're gonna have to go back
to the hotel, mate.


175
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:38.430
- Can I not just use yours?
- No, you can't just use mine.


176
00:15:38.508 --> 00:15:41.048
You can't put .270 ammo
into a .243 rifle.


177
00:15:41.133 --> 00:15:44.883
- You'll blow your own head off.
- Okay, I don't care. I'll just...


178
00:15:44.967 --> 00:15:48.087
Use my .22.
And please don't fucking drop that.


179
00:17:19.217 --> 00:17:21.337
You take it, man. I'm not.

180
00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.590
It's your spot, your kill.

181
00:17:33.175 --> 00:17:35.585
Now, remember what I said.

182
00:17:35.675 --> 00:17:38.425
Just relax and let it happen.

183
00:17:45.258 --> 00:17:47.968
Do it now, Vaughn. 
Take the shot.

184
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.630
Do it. Now, Vaughn.

185
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.800
Vaughn. Vaughn, come back. Vaughn, no.

186
00:18:23.133 --> 00:18:24.803
Vaughn.

187
00:18:26.758 --> 00:18:28.338
Vaughn.

188
00:18:41.717 --> 00:18:43.427
Sammy!

189
00:18:45.008 --> 00:18:46.548
Sammy!

190
00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:59.090
Here. Here.

191
00:18:59.967 --> 00:19:02.427
Come on. Come on.

192
00:19:13.508 --> 00:19:15.588
Okay, okay.

193
00:19:20.925 --> 00:19:23.045
You fucking...

194
00:19:26.758 --> 00:19:28.048
Shit.

195
00:19:34.842 --> 00:19:36.552
Sorry.

196
00:19:37.842 --> 00:19:39.512
Sammy.

197
00:19:40.758 --> 00:19:42.838
Sammy. Sammy!

198
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.880
Oh, my boy!

199
00:19:47.133 --> 00:19:48.763
Sammy.

200
00:19:49.508 --> 00:19:51.218
Sammy.

201
00:19:52.925 --> 00:19:55.005
Oh, my boy.

202
00:19:57.925 --> 00:20:01.215
Oh, my boy. Oh, Sammy. I didn't see him.
I didn't see him. I didn't see him.


203
00:20:27.883 --> 00:20:29.093
I didn't...

204
00:20:31.425 --> 00:20:34.835
I didn't see him. 
I didn't see him.

205
00:21:14.883 --> 00:21:16.973
Oh, my God.

206
00:22:10.592 --> 00:22:14.632
Okay, here we go.
Here we go. Come here.

207
00:22:14.758 --> 00:22:17.218
There we go. There we go.

208
00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.470
Come on. There we go. There we go.
There we go. There we go.


209
00:22:27.758 --> 00:22:29.798
Run. Run.

210
00:22:29.925 --> 00:22:31.585
Run.

211
00:23:42.592 --> 00:23:45.632
Marcus. Marcus.
What are you doing? Marcus.


212
00:23:48.175 --> 00:23:51.465
Marcus. Marcus. Marcus.
What are you doing?


213
00:23:51.592 --> 00:23:54.222
We have to be seen hunting
somewhere else.


214
00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.300
- What? We're just gonna report it.
- You shot a child.


215
00:23:59.258 --> 00:24:00.798
It was... It was an accident.

216
00:24:00.883 --> 00:24:02.633
- With my gun.
- It was a fucking accident.


217
00:24:02.717 --> 00:24:04.377
It's illegal for you
to even use my gun.

218
00:24:04.508 --> 00:24:06.258
I don't care.
We just go to the police...


219
00:24:06.383 --> 00:24:07.973
- Go to the police?
- We explain.


220
00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:11.050
Stinking of whisky?
It'll be considered murder.


221
00:24:13.925 --> 00:24:17.215
Can you handle prison, mate?
Because I don't think I can.


222
00:24:17.342 --> 00:24:19.342
Jesus, fuck, man.
Jesus fucking Christ.


223
00:24:19.508 --> 00:24:22.718
- Fucking Anna, man. Fuck.
- Exactly, Vaughn. Exactly.


224
00:24:22.842 --> 00:24:24.932
You could be in for years.

225
00:24:26.717 --> 00:24:30.507
And I shot that man from over
a hundred yards away. I'm fucked too.


226
00:24:31.592 --> 00:24:34.802
Because I was protecting you, Vaughn.
Protecting you.


227
00:24:46.008 --> 00:24:49.088
They were in a tent.
They were probably tourists.


228
00:24:49.175 --> 00:24:51.795
And we are in the middle
of fucking nowhere.


229
00:24:51.883 --> 00:24:53.883
In hundreds of miles of forest.

230
00:24:56.092 --> 00:24:59.512
If we bury the bodies, it could be days,
weeks, months until they're found.


231
00:24:59.592 --> 00:25:02.972
I'm not fucking burying people.
Listen to what you're saying.


232
00:25:03.092 --> 00:25:06.882
We go back to that town and we come
back here tonight and we bury them.


233
00:25:07.633 --> 00:25:10.053
No, man.
Look, listen to yourself, Marcus.


234
00:25:10.133 --> 00:25:13.883
- We're not burying people.
- The alternatives are unthinkable.


235
00:25:16.467 --> 00:25:17.967
- Vaughn...
- Just shut up. Shut up.


236
00:25:18.133 --> 00:25:20.933
- You have to trust me.
- I... Shut up.


237
00:25:25.842 --> 00:25:27.932
I'm getting us out of this, mate.

238
00:25:29.383 --> 00:25:32.933
I'm doing this for both our sakes.
You just have to trust me.


239
00:25:35.175 --> 00:25:37.255
I can't do this, man.

240
00:25:38.425 --> 00:25:41.175
You have no choice.
You have no choice, Vaughn.


241
00:26:31.508 --> 00:26:34.378
We need to be seen up here.
Further north.


242
00:26:36.592 --> 00:26:38.632
There has to be something.

243
00:27:06.508 --> 00:27:08.128
Hi.

244
00:27:09.425 --> 00:27:12.715
Oh, it's a cold one. How are you?

245
00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.800
Culcarran's south.
What are you doing up here?


246
00:27:16.925 --> 00:27:19.295
We've been hunting Drumrain
all afternoon.


247
00:27:19.383 --> 00:27:24.053
Aye, Logan told me about you.
There's no other stalkers out.


248
00:27:29.383 --> 00:27:31.473
Be still.

249
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.720
- How much for the fuel?
- Call it 20.


250
00:27:44.758 --> 00:27:47.178
Thank you. Have a nice day.

251
00:27:51.717 --> 00:27:53.427
Aye.

252
00:28:10.383 --> 00:28:12.053
You okay?

253
00:28:17.342 --> 00:28:19.762
Nothing happened out there, okay?

254
00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.800
Yeah, we could... Okay.
We could do that next... next week.


255
00:28:35.883 --> 00:28:38.183
Oh, okay. Got to go.

256
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.680
- How did you get on?
- Oh, a total washout.


257
00:28:40.758 --> 00:28:46.508
Oh. Well, no chefs tonight.
But there's bar food at the Stag's.


258
00:28:46.592 --> 00:28:49.222
Or there's the restaurant there.
It's pricey, mind.


259
00:28:49.383 --> 00:28:52.223
- Thanks.
- Alright. Thank you so much.


260
00:28:52.342 --> 00:28:54.592
- Thank you.
- Night.


261
00:29:07.383 --> 00:29:09.433
We need to eat.

262
00:29:10.925 --> 00:29:14.295
And we need to get out there.
It won't look right if we don't.


263
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.680
Hey. Fancy some more drinks tonight?

264
00:29:38.758 --> 00:29:41.128
- Not tonight.
- Maybe later?


265
00:29:41.258 --> 00:29:43.128
Tomorrow.
Let's go, Vaughn. I'm starving.


266
00:29:43.258 --> 00:29:46.588
- You okay?
- Yeah, just a bit hungover.


267
00:29:58.633 --> 00:30:02.183
- Uh, where is the restaurant?
- Just round to the left.


268
00:30:02.342 --> 00:30:04.432
Thank you.

269
00:30:14.717 --> 00:30:16.127
Evening.

270
00:30:16.217 --> 00:30:18.627
Join us if you like.

271
00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:23.130
Yeah, sure. Why not?

272
00:30:24.092 --> 00:30:26.722
This is... This is Al.
He's a cousin of mine.


273
00:30:26.842 --> 00:30:29.342
- Al, this is Marcus and Vaughn.
- Pleased to meet you.


274
00:30:29.425 --> 00:30:31.335
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a seat.


275
00:30:31.425 --> 00:30:33.045
Please.

276
00:30:35.758 --> 00:30:38.588
Successful day's stalking?

277
00:30:38.675 --> 00:30:40.585
Uh, no. A total washout.

278
00:30:40.675 --> 00:30:43.675
Oh. Well, let's see
if we can't improve things.


279
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.550
I, uh, well, I...
I recommend the venison.


280
00:30:46.633 --> 00:30:48.343
Huh?

281
00:30:49.342 --> 00:30:52.052
- Yeah.
- Good. Peter, two more venison.


282
00:30:52.883 --> 00:30:55.723
- Some wine?
- Please.


283
00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:02.045
You look a bit rough. 
Are you alright?

284
00:31:02.175 --> 00:31:05.045
Yeah, yeah. Just had far too much
last night. Stupid.


285
00:31:05.133 --> 00:31:06.513
Don't feel great.

286
00:31:06.592 --> 00:31:09.092
That's really no state
to have gone hunting in.


287
00:31:10.008 --> 00:31:13.008
- Isn't that right, Alastair?
- Shocking behavior.


288
00:31:13.092 --> 00:31:15.932
Aye,
you wouldnae catch us doing that.


289
00:31:20.342 --> 00:31:23.262
- As long as you had a good time.
- Yeah.


290
00:31:24.133 --> 00:31:26.343
So where did you lads stalk?

291
00:31:27.967 --> 00:31:31.257
Drumrain. It's beautiful up there,
really beautiful.


292
00:31:31.342 --> 00:31:36.722
The woods are right enough.
But not the village. Not any more.


293
00:31:37.592 --> 00:31:39.472
Yeah, what's happening with that place?

294
00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:43.800
It's turning into a ghost town.
It's just dying, slowly, over time.


295
00:31:43.883 --> 00:31:47.843
These kind of villages, they, well,
they survive on a knife's edge.


296
00:31:48.508 --> 00:31:51.338
I can imagine it's quite rough
up here this time of year.


297
00:31:51.508 --> 00:31:55.008
Aye. And brutal not so long ago.

298
00:31:55.092 --> 00:31:57.972
There's always a risk
of things sliding back that way.


299
00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:01.050
Aye, it pretty well comes down
on the individual folk


300
00:32:01.133 --> 00:32:02.553
to maintain the order of things.

301
00:32:03.008 --> 00:32:06.928
Logan and his father before him,
they held this place together.


302
00:32:07.633 --> 00:32:09.013
Aye. We all have.

303
00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.130
Are you... Are you not enjoying that?

304
00:32:18.217 --> 00:32:20.467
No, no. It's lovely, lovely.

305
00:32:24.092 --> 00:32:28.182
So, Iona tells me
that you're about to become a father.


306
00:32:29.508 --> 00:32:31.798
- Yeah, I am. Yeah, yeah.
- Congratulations.


307
00:32:31.883 --> 00:32:34.053
Yeah, thank you.

308
00:32:34.175 --> 00:32:35.755
Is that a boy
or a girl you're having?

309
00:32:35.925 --> 00:32:38.585
Excuse me for just a second.
Be right back.


310
00:32:40.675 --> 00:32:43.625
Early to bed tonight, aye?

311
00:32:59.925 --> 00:33:01.965
Folk are resilient up here.

312
00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:04.720
They'll take three, four jobs
to survive.


313
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.840
If the work's there.

314
00:33:06.925 --> 00:33:09.085
So what is it you do yourself?
Finance and investment.


315
00:33:11.092 --> 00:33:12.932
Hmm.

316
00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:20.970
Aye, we've... we've rested
on past glories here, fallen behind.


317
00:33:21.092 --> 00:33:22.762
But we'll make it through this stretch.

318
00:33:22.883 --> 00:33:25.883
And there's real, well, there's
real potential for development here.


319
00:33:25.967 --> 00:33:28.007
Absolutely. Anyone can see that.

320
00:33:28.092 --> 00:33:30.802
Listen, I don't wanna
put you on the spot


321
00:33:30.883 --> 00:33:34.183
or sully a good dinner with business,
but could I give you my card?


322
00:33:34.258 --> 00:33:37.838
Yeah, sure. I know
some good people you could talk to.


323
00:33:37.925 --> 00:33:40.505
Thank you. Good man.

324
00:33:41.883 --> 00:33:43.593
Cheers.

325
00:34:36.508 --> 00:34:39.088
Is he... Is he okay in there?

326
00:34:39.217 --> 00:34:43.427
I should check on him. It's my fault
he's had too many drinks last night.


327
00:34:45.258 --> 00:34:48.258
- Aye.
- Are you alright?


328
00:34:48.342 --> 00:34:50.592
- Yeah, yeah.
- Alright?


329
00:34:50.675 --> 00:34:53.675
I think I'm gonna waive the food
for just now.


330
00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.220
- Stomach's not quite up to it yet.
- Aye, we've all been there.


331
00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.510
Aye, some of us more times than others.

332
00:35:02.217 --> 00:35:05.877
We'd offer another, but it's, well,
it's obviously not the night, huh?


333
00:35:05.967 --> 00:35:07.177
No.

334
00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.680
We should...
We should shoot in any case.


335
00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.220
Still lots to prepare
for Alban Eiler tomorrow.


336
00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.880
- And what's that?
- It's a solstice festival.


337
00:35:15.008 --> 00:35:16.878
It marks the last week
of the hunting season.


338
00:35:17.008 --> 00:35:20.218
Well, it's just a... a piss-up
and a bonfire these days, really.


339
00:35:20.342 --> 00:35:22.592
But brings everyone together.

340
00:35:24.467 --> 00:35:27.757
The, uh, bill's covered. I insist.

341
00:35:29.092 --> 00:35:31.552
- That's very generous. Thank you.
- Pleasure to meet you.


342
00:35:31.633 --> 00:35:33.013
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.


343
00:35:33.092 --> 00:35:34.972
You're welcome. Take care.
Get some rest.


344
00:35:35.092 --> 00:35:36.342
- I will.
- I've got your card.


345
00:35:36.425 --> 00:35:37.609
- Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.


346
00:35:37.633 --> 00:35:40.683
Have a good night. Take care.

347
00:36:42.425 --> 00:36:43.795
This isn't going to be easy.

348
00:36:51.717 --> 00:36:53.297
It's four hours till daylight.

349
00:36:55.508 --> 00:36:56.628
We need to dig a hole.

350
00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.510
Six foot deep.

351
00:37:03.758 --> 00:37:05.468
Here.

352
00:37:10.467 --> 00:37:12.927
- Vaughn.
- Yeah.


353
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:37.720
- Fucking hell, man.
- If we're seen here, we're fucked.


354
00:37:38.508 --> 00:37:41.008
You've been a complete liability
since this has happened.


355
00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:44.552
Vaughn, take the torch
and help me dig this fucking thing.


356
00:40:08.633 --> 00:40:10.723
Okay, that's enough.

357
00:40:11.883 --> 00:40:13.763
- You said six feet.
- I know. It'll have to do.


358
00:40:13.883 --> 00:40:16.933
We've no time.
Daylight's coming. Come on.


359
00:40:26.467 --> 00:40:28.087
Okay.

360
00:40:28.842 --> 00:40:30.972
Under the arms. Ready?

361
00:41:07.175 --> 00:41:08.795
Oh, God.

362
00:41:18.842 --> 00:41:20.432
What the fuck you doing?

363
00:41:28.592 --> 00:41:30.632
The other bullet's in his skull.

364
00:41:32.675 --> 00:41:35.425
It's traceable back to me.
It's as good as a fingerprint, Vaughn.


365
00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:37.720
I don't fucking care.
Put the fucking knife away.


366
00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.300
Vaughn, think.

367
00:41:39.383 --> 00:41:41.683
If they find the bodies,

368
00:41:41.758 --> 00:41:45.008
they'll find the bullet
and they'll come looking for me.


369
00:41:47.425 --> 00:41:51.545
It's a child, Marcus.
It's a little boy.


370
00:41:51.633 --> 00:41:54.053
- Do you think I want to do this?
- No, I don't think you do.


371
00:41:54.133 --> 00:41:57.513
- So put the fucking knife away.
- I have no choice, Vaughn.


372
00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.090
I have no choice.

373
00:42:05.175 --> 00:42:07.255
Vaughn. Vaughn.

374
00:42:08.342 --> 00:42:09.882
Vaughn.

375
00:42:09.967 --> 00:42:13.677
Fucking leave! Move. Stay down.

376
00:42:13.758 --> 00:42:15.298
Stay down, mate, please.

377
00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:51.930
The sun will be up in an hour.

378
00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.430
We go back, stay
for a couple of hours.

379
00:43:58.842 --> 00:44:00.932
Wait until the village wakes up.

380
00:44:04.842 --> 00:44:06.882
Then make our excuses and leave.

381
00:44:48.467 --> 00:44:50.377
What?

382
00:44:51.842 --> 00:44:53.932
Jesus. Come on.

383
00:45:11.092 --> 00:45:14.842
Try to rest.
I'll wake you in a couple of hours.


384
00:47:44.967 --> 00:47:47.047
Christ. I must have passed out.

385
00:47:51.383 --> 00:47:52.883
It's midday, Marcus.

386
00:47:55.217 --> 00:47:59.627
No harm done. We just pack our bags
and we get out of here.


387
00:48:03.758 --> 00:48:05.838
Come on, man.

388
00:48:41.925 --> 00:48:44.295
This is it.
Give me that fucking knife.


389
00:48:53.133 --> 00:48:56.183
Something's happening.
There's people at the jeep.


390
00:48:58.092 --> 00:49:00.722
Hey. What's going on?

391
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:04.840
Whoa. Hey.

392
00:49:04.925 --> 00:49:07.375
Tell me what you did.
Tell me what you did.


393
00:49:07.467 --> 00:49:09.507
What the hell's going on?

394
00:49:09.592 --> 00:49:13.632
- Fucking fucker!
- Away from him, for Christ's sake!


395
00:49:13.758 --> 00:49:16.678
- What are you doing?
- Fucking bastard.


396
00:49:16.758 --> 00:49:20.758
Tell him what you did. Tell him
what you did. You know what he did?


397
00:49:22.717 --> 00:49:24.757
He fucked Kara.

398
00:49:26.258 --> 00:49:30.048
Gave her cocaine.
Filled her with the stuff.


399
00:49:35.967 --> 00:49:39.087
Hey, let him go. Let him go.

400
00:49:40.133 --> 00:49:41.683
Let him go.

401
00:49:43.092 --> 00:49:45.842
Get away, alright? I'll deal with this.
I'll deal with this.


402
00:49:46.008 --> 00:49:48.088
I'll deal with this, alright?

403
00:49:49.883 --> 00:49:51.883
You're a boss, little brother.

404
00:49:52.008 --> 00:49:55.798
I don't wanna hear another word
about cocaine. Do you understand?


405
00:49:58.425 --> 00:50:02.175
Frank will take care of this.
Get the jeep over to the garage.


406
00:50:02.342 --> 00:50:05.132
Bring a truck over, Granty,
and the A-frame.


407
00:50:05.258 --> 00:50:06.798
Take the sex pest with you.

408
00:50:06.883 --> 00:50:09.683
So, will we look at the damage?

409
00:50:11.925 --> 00:50:13.625
Cannae say I didnae warn you.

410
00:50:17.425 --> 00:50:18.715
That's bad.

411
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:24.090
And that one's slashed too.
They're both fucked.


412
00:50:36.842 --> 00:50:40.092
What the fuck are we gonna do?
That stuff's in the boot.


413
00:50:40.217 --> 00:50:42.587
We need to get it out.

414
00:50:42.717 --> 00:50:44.797
There's blood on the shirt.

415
00:50:46.383 --> 00:50:48.473
We need to get a car.

416
00:50:49.675 --> 00:50:53.965
And we need to get rid of it, and
we can't get rid of it near the village.


417
00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:04.220
That second tyre, mate,
isn't gonna be cheap.


418
00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:08.090
Can I get the keys? Just meant
to grab our stuff out the boot.


419
00:51:10.925 --> 00:51:14.585
Where's the sex pest? Lazy fuck.

420
00:51:14.675 --> 00:51:17.085
Granty, check that spare for me.

421
00:51:29.592 --> 00:51:31.682
Here you go. Can
we get it today, like?

422
00:52:21.133 --> 00:52:22.803
Hmm.

423
00:52:24.467 --> 00:52:25.967
It'll cost you extra.

424
00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:28.760
550, including labour.

425
00:52:33.425 --> 00:52:35.045
Okay.

426
00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:38.130
Okay, send it up.

427
00:52:38.217 --> 00:52:41.337
- Do you have a car we could use?
- Nope.


428
00:52:41.425 --> 00:52:43.925
We just wanted to get
some last-minute stalking in.


429
00:52:44.008 --> 00:52:46.258
Well, you probably blew
your chances of that


430
00:52:46.342 --> 00:52:50.342
when you fed somebody's daughter full of coke.
There'll not be a queue of people lining up round here


431
00:52:51.133 --> 00:52:52.803
to do you any favors, pal.

432
00:52:52.925 --> 00:52:55.675
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Give it a fucking rest, will you?


433
00:52:55.758 --> 00:52:58.428
- Do you need me this afternoon?
- No.


434
00:52:58.508 --> 00:53:01.928
I'll make do with that useless bastard.
Get your fucking rags on.


435
00:53:02.008 --> 00:53:05.048
Pete might take you out in his taxi.
I think he's in the Stag's.


436
00:53:05.133 --> 00:53:06.763
I'll get you over there, point him out.

437
00:53:06.883 --> 00:53:10.183
- Sounds good.
- Jeep'll be ready tomorrow.


438
00:53:13.467 --> 00:53:15.257
For 550, you can finish it today.

439
00:53:15.342 --> 00:53:18.972
For 550,
I'll finish it when I fucking like.


440
00:53:47.342 --> 00:53:49.432
No fucking way, Al.

441
00:53:51.467 --> 00:53:54.177
He doesn't look good.

442
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.840
Pete, these guys are wanting a taxi.

443
00:53:57.008 --> 00:53:59.258
Then I'm your man.

444
00:53:59.342 --> 00:54:01.262
Let's go.

445
00:54:01.383 --> 00:54:03.843
Sit down, you silly sod.
You're steaming.


446
00:54:03.967 --> 00:54:06.587
- No, it's fine. Sorry, sorry.
- Sit down, man. Sit down.


447
00:54:06.758 --> 00:54:08.338
Thank you, though.

448
00:54:08.467 --> 00:54:10.717
Follow me, lads. Come on.
Take a seat over there.


449
00:54:10.883 --> 00:54:13.433
Go on. I just want a chat with you.
Sit down.


450
00:54:14.967 --> 00:54:18.507
There you go, boys. On the house.

451
00:54:25.217 --> 00:54:29.377
Now, these pints are for you
by way of an apology.


452
00:54:30.592 --> 00:54:33.182
An apology for messing up your car
and your stupid face.


453
00:54:33.258 --> 00:54:34.928
Brian.

454
00:54:36.508 --> 00:54:40.628
Even though you fucked my best mate's
daughter and gave her cocaine.


455
00:54:43.217 --> 00:54:44.297
Sounds fair.

456
00:54:46.508 --> 00:54:50.338
Sounds fair that I should apologize
to these arseholes


457
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:53.380
'cause Logan says one is due.

458
00:54:54.508 --> 00:54:59.878
'Cause this twat here
is gonna bring investment in.


459
00:54:59.967 --> 00:55:02.547
- That's enough, Brian.
- No, it's not enough.


460
00:55:02.633 --> 00:55:05.303
Investments. Grants.

461
00:55:06.508 --> 00:55:08.758
Shite, the lot of it.

462
00:55:10.175 --> 00:55:12.875
And fucking embarrassing.

463
00:55:12.967 --> 00:55:17.007
Begging to city twats like this

464
00:55:17.092 --> 00:55:19.182
when we all know what should be done!

465
00:55:19.258 --> 00:55:21.678
Facing up to how fucked we are

466
00:55:21.758 --> 00:55:24.428
and doing whatever's necessary
to look out for ourselves.


467
00:55:24.508 --> 00:55:27.298
Whatever's necessary.

468
00:55:28.425 --> 00:55:29.925
Like folk used to.

469
00:55:31.592 --> 00:55:33.342
'Cause nae other bastards will.

470
00:55:41.467 --> 00:55:45.837
But Logan calls the shots
and apparently you do too, so...


471
00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:49.590
I'll apologize.

472
00:55:53.967 --> 00:55:55.087
I'm sorry, my friend.

473
00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:04.970
And I'm sorry to you too, pal.

474
00:56:05.133 --> 00:56:07.223
- I'm sorry.
- Am I fuck!


475
00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:08.760
Fucking...

476
00:56:08.842 --> 00:56:11.632
Take your fucking hands off me.

477
00:56:13.425 --> 00:56:14.835
I'm going anyway.

478
00:56:17.883 --> 00:56:21.383
- Fuck.
- Better get yourself cleaned up.


479
00:56:21.467 --> 00:56:23.127
Fuck.

480
00:56:25.342 --> 00:56:26.682
I'm sorry about this.

481
00:56:27.592 --> 00:56:30.472
- No, it's fine.
- Just finish your pint, huh?


482
00:56:31.258 --> 00:56:33.298
Yeah.

483
00:56:39.133 --> 00:56:40.803
Some day.

484
00:56:44.592 --> 00:56:48.432
It's Kara, you know.
She stirs everything up.


485
00:56:48.508 --> 00:56:50.758
Hmm.

486
00:56:50.842 --> 00:56:53.302
You know Brian's not alone
in his way of thinking.


487
00:56:53.383 --> 00:56:56.473
Well, they're wrong.
Let's not go down that road.


488
00:56:56.592 --> 00:57:00.722
I'm just saying. People are wound tight.
Logan needs to stay canny.


489
00:57:05.217 --> 00:57:09.427
- Where is he, anyway?
- He's out. Looking for Sammy.


490
00:57:10.092 --> 00:57:11.682
What's the story with that?

491
00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:16.180
Oh, they went camping supposedly.
Due in last night.


492
00:57:16.258 --> 00:57:19.678
Mary's not heard from them.
She's a bit concerned.


493
00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:24.220
Logan's nephew and brother-in-law.

494
00:57:25.925 --> 00:57:27.335
Oh, right.

495
00:57:27.467 --> 00:57:30.967
Logan'll find him. You know
how he dotes on that little 'un.


496
00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:35.430
It'll likely be nothing.

497
00:57:40.925 --> 00:57:44.005
- Are youse okay?
- Logan's nephew's missing.


498
00:57:44.092 --> 00:57:46.592
Camping in the woods.

499
00:57:46.675 --> 00:57:49.005
Oh, right.

500
00:57:49.092 --> 00:57:52.092
- And when were they due back?
- They?


501
00:57:56.717 --> 00:57:58.547
Well, he didn't go alone, did he?

502
00:57:58.633 --> 00:58:00.803
Why not?

503
00:58:00.883 --> 00:58:04.513
- An 11-year-old on his own?
- He doesn't know what age he is.


504
00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:09.510
Well, no, I just remembered
Logan mentioning something, didn't he?


505
00:58:09.592 --> 00:58:11.092
Yeah.

506
00:58:13.467 --> 00:58:15.547
Sorry. I just assumed.

507
00:58:21.175 --> 00:58:23.585
- So when's the bonfire?
- It's at seven.


508
00:58:23.675 --> 00:58:26.545
- Right.
- Yeah, we should make a move.


509
00:58:26.633 --> 00:58:30.263
- Yeah.
- Let's make a move, then.


510
00:58:30.342 --> 00:58:31.802
- Leaving already?
- Probably best.


511
00:58:31.883 --> 00:58:34.473
You needn't worry about Brian.
He won't try anything again.


512
00:58:34.592 --> 00:58:36.882
No, we've had a rough day, and I...

513
00:58:36.967 --> 00:58:39.627
But thank you so much.
And it's my round, so here.


514
00:58:39.717 --> 00:58:41.797
- Oh.
- Get a drink on me.


515
00:58:41.925 --> 00:58:43.755
Thank you so much, though.
Have a great day.


516
00:58:43.883 --> 00:58:45.593
Sorry.

517
00:58:48.467 --> 00:58:50.967
Thanks very much for the drinks.
Thank you.


518
00:59:07.633 --> 00:59:09.343
- Get rid of it.
- Where?


519
00:59:09.467 --> 00:59:11.177
I don't care, man. 
Just get rid of it.

520
00:59:11.258 --> 00:59:14.588
Marcus, it's their fucking relatives.
Just get rid of it.


521
01:00:35.425 --> 01:00:38.375
They could start searching those woods
any minute.


522
01:00:42.342 --> 01:00:44.432
There's miles of forest.

523
01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:47.342
We just have to keep our nerve.

524
01:00:54.092 --> 01:00:56.182
What about the boy?

525
01:00:57.008 --> 01:00:59.088
Just hope he stays quiet.

526
01:01:02.967 --> 01:01:05.087
It's getting to me.

527
01:01:12.383 --> 01:01:14.013
Vaughn...

528
01:01:15.592 --> 01:01:17.632
Everything I did here...

529
01:01:20.383 --> 01:01:22.133
I did it to protect us.

530
01:01:24.342 --> 01:01:26.842
Every decision I made,
I made it from my gut.


531
01:01:30.133 --> 01:01:32.843
And if we were in those woods,
you'd make the same decisions for me.


532
01:01:32.967 --> 01:01:34.837
Am I right?

533
01:01:37.550 --> 01:01:39.590
We were wrong. 
We were wrong.

534
01:01:43.967 --> 01:01:46.627
And we're gonna pay for it
because we should have just told them.


535
01:01:46.758 --> 01:01:51.178
Then go and tell them. Go and tell them.
They will rip you to pieces, Vaughn.


536
01:01:56.008 --> 01:01:58.838
Everything I did here
I did to protect you.


537
01:02:00.008 --> 01:02:02.428
And you're telling me I was wrong.

538
01:02:07.175 --> 01:02:09.125
You know you are, Marcus.

539
01:02:13.883 --> 01:02:16.013
Otherwise you wouldn't ask.

540
01:03:05.592 --> 01:03:08.222
Alright? What you doing up here?

541
01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:11.010
Just... Just having a drink.

542
01:03:11.092 --> 01:03:13.262
Well, get yourselves down there
for Christ's sakes.


543
01:03:13.342 --> 01:03:16.552
It's Alban Eiler.
People are expecting you.


544
01:03:16.633 --> 01:03:19.473
I think it's probably best
if we just stay in here tonight.


545
01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:21.840
It's festival night.
Get yourself down there.


546
01:03:24.092 --> 01:03:26.342
Yeah, of course, yeah.
We'll be there in two secs.


547
01:03:26.508 --> 01:03:30.048
Okay. See you down there.

548
01:03:30.133 --> 01:03:32.223
See you.

549
01:04:00.467 --> 01:04:02.587
- Help yourself, man.
- Thank you.


550
01:04:02.717 --> 01:04:04.967
Food's over there.

551
01:04:05.092 --> 01:04:06.762
Thanks.

552
01:04:43.758 --> 01:04:45.378
Have you told your mummy that?

553
01:04:45.550 --> 01:04:47.590
Bloody disappeared.

554
01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:58.630
Something's not right here,
man. Something's not right.


555
01:05:08.842 --> 01:05:12.972
Guys. Logan wants to speak to youse.

556
01:05:24.217 --> 01:05:26.587
My sister's husband and son
haven't come in.


557
01:05:26.675 --> 01:05:28.545
We know. Sorry to hear that.

558
01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:30.383
But we've found the car further north.

559
01:05:30.467 --> 01:05:33.427
We've asked around
and we've a decent idea where they were.


560
01:05:33.508 --> 01:05:37.508
We're putting together a search party.
Will you... Will you come out?


561
01:05:41.008 --> 01:05:43.588
Look, we need help out there.

562
01:05:44.925 --> 01:05:46.295
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah, of course.


563
01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:50.760
Let's go.
The jeep's fixed. It's over there.


564
01:05:57.675 --> 01:05:59.755
Follow us out, yeah?

565
01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:13.472
Why did they give us the jeep?

566
01:06:13.592 --> 01:06:16.182
Because they want as many people
out here as possible, Marcus.


567
01:06:16.342 --> 01:06:18.012
They think they're still fucking alive.

568
01:06:18.133 --> 01:06:19.763
No, man. I think they're onto us.

569
01:06:19.925 --> 01:06:21.875
I think they're trying
to force our hand.


570
01:06:21.967 --> 01:06:23.627
Jesus.

571
01:06:25.175 --> 01:06:29.255
If we make a run for it now,
then they'll know for sure.


572
01:06:40.675 --> 01:06:43.175
Jesus, Marcus, we're going right there.
We're going to it.


573
01:06:43.342 --> 01:06:45.802
This road's miles long.
These woods are massive.


574
01:06:45.883 --> 01:06:47.323
What if they find the fucking grave?

575
01:06:47.383 --> 01:06:51.303
If they find the fucking grave, you will
make a run for it, mate, believe me.


576
01:06:57.425 --> 01:07:00.625
That was it. That was the place.
We've gone past it.


577
01:07:01.592 --> 01:07:03.882
They're going the wrong way. We're okay.

578
01:07:38.383 --> 01:07:40.343
What were you doing last night?

579
01:07:40.508 --> 01:07:43.718
- What do you mean?
- Well, what do you think I mean?


580
01:07:46.425 --> 01:07:51.045
Look, we went night hunting. I know it's
illegal, but it was my idea, not his.


581
01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:53.553
Well, that will be reported
to the police.


582
01:07:54.133 --> 01:07:55.843
Where did you night hunt?

583
01:07:57.717 --> 01:07:59.377
Uh, Gunn's Wood.

584
01:08:03.883 --> 01:08:05.723
Know how to work that, right? Yeah?

585
01:08:05.842 --> 01:08:07.932
Yeah, cheers. Thank you.

586
01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:16.090
Just keep an eye
on both of them, eh?

587
01:08:32.967 --> 01:08:35.587
Come on, come on.
Shh, shh. Here, here, here.


588
01:08:37.467 --> 01:08:43.627
Three groups. Grant, Angus,
you two, take the right-hand path.


589
01:08:43.717 --> 01:08:46.127
- Al, Frank...
- Iona, you're with me.


590
01:08:46.217 --> 01:08:50.047
Over here, come on. Let's go. Here.

591
01:08:57.592 --> 01:08:59.302
Sammy! Sammy!

592
01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.720
Sammy!

593
01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.510
Sammy!

594
01:09:09.967 --> 01:09:11.877
Sammy!

595
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:15.180
Calum!

596
01:09:16.967 --> 01:09:19.257
- Here, here.
- Calum!


597
01:09:19.842 --> 01:09:21.552
Hey! Sammy!

598
01:09:21.633 --> 01:09:23.303
Sammy!

599
01:09:25.925 --> 01:09:27.425
Sammy!

600
01:09:33.175 --> 01:09:34.835
Sammy!

601
01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:37.880
Sammy!

602
01:09:37.967 --> 01:09:39.627
Sammy!

603
01:09:41.842 --> 01:09:43.552
Sammy!

604
01:09:46.133 --> 01:09:47.763
Calum!

605
01:09:48.258 --> 01:09:50.928
Angus. Angus. Anything at all?

606
01:09:51.008 --> 01:09:53.338
Here. Nothing.

607
01:09:54.008 --> 01:09:56.258
- Calum!
- Sammy!


608
01:09:56.383 --> 01:09:58.013
Sammy!

609
01:10:00.883 --> 01:10:04.473
We're really up against it.
It's just too large an area.


610
01:10:04.592 --> 01:10:05.722
Come on.

611
01:10:06.342 --> 01:10:08.052
Sammy!

612
01:10:10.675 --> 01:10:12.335
Sammy!

613
01:10:15.842 --> 01:10:17.512
Sammy!

614
01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:21.840
Calum!

615
01:10:22.592 --> 01:10:24.182
Sammy!

616
01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:28.130
Sammy!

617
01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:32.175
Calum! Sammy!

618
01:10:36.467 --> 01:10:39.127
Dog's picked up a scent!

619
01:10:41.425 --> 01:10:43.585
We've picked up a scent. Southeast.

620
01:10:44.633 --> 01:10:46.303
Sammy!

621
01:10:46.425 --> 01:10:48.125
- Calum!
- Sammy!


622
01:10:50.217 --> 01:10:51.877
Sammy!

623
01:10:54.175 --> 01:10:57.255
Seek. Seek. Come on.

624
01:10:57.425 --> 01:10:59.505
Here. Seek.

625
01:11:01.342 --> 01:11:03.762
- Here you are!
- Huh? Here.


626
01:11:07.008 --> 01:11:09.628
- Is there anything?
- Here.


627
01:11:11.092 --> 01:11:13.512
Angus, what's there?
What have you found?


628
01:11:13.592 --> 01:11:16.592
Over here! Dig.

629
01:11:18.258 --> 01:11:22.008
This ground's been disturbed.
There's something here.


630
01:11:27.717 --> 01:11:30.087
Help!

631
01:11:33.467 --> 01:11:35.177
Jesus.

632
01:11:41.633 --> 01:11:43.723
Dig. Dig!

633
01:11:45.008 --> 01:11:47.008
Here. Help me.

634
01:12:02.717 --> 01:12:04.837
Sammy.

635
01:12:04.967 --> 01:12:06.627
No. Sammy...

636
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:23.220
They've gone.

637
01:12:27.092 --> 01:12:28.762
Fuck.

638
01:12:29.925 --> 01:12:31.175
Fuck.

639
01:12:31.342 --> 01:12:32.432
They've gone!

640
01:12:38.092 --> 01:12:40.182
Brian.

641
01:12:44.717 --> 01:12:46.467
Brian.

642
01:13:21.258 --> 01:13:23.008
Use your fucking head.

643
01:13:23.092 --> 01:13:25.552
Come on. Angus, keys!

644
01:13:58.883 --> 01:14:00.593
What the fuck?!

645
01:14:01.675 --> 01:14:04.175
What the fuck? 
That's impossible.

646
01:14:04.258 --> 01:14:06.378
What? Hold on.

647
01:14:08.967 --> 01:14:12.257
- What the fuck?!
- Come on. Come on, man, fucking go!


648
01:14:15.467 --> 01:14:16.467
Run.

649
01:14:24.342 --> 01:14:25.682
Over there!

650
01:14:28.592 --> 01:14:30.932
No guns except Al. Come on.

651
01:14:33.217 --> 01:14:34.877
Here. Come on.

652
01:14:36.342 --> 01:14:38.222
- Go, go!
- Vaughn.


653
01:15:21.092 --> 01:15:24.302
- Vaughn. Vaughn, get up. Vaughn.
- I guess I can't.


654
01:15:24.383 --> 01:15:27.513
- You have to run!
- I can't fucking move. Just go.


655
01:15:27.592 --> 01:15:31.842
- Come on.
- Fucking go, Marcus. Just fucking go!


656
01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:39.050
No, wait. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.


657
01:15:39.175 --> 01:15:42.545
Brian, no! Logan, do something.

658
01:15:42.633 --> 01:15:44.723
- He'll kill him.
- Get him away for fuck's sake!


659
01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.510
- Brian!
- Get him away!


660
01:15:46.592 --> 01:15:48.052
Brian!

661
01:15:48.133 --> 01:15:52.803
Al, take Rab. Take Johnny and Rab.
The other one, he went that way.


662
01:15:52.883 --> 01:15:54.973
Just you three.
I don't want a free-for-all.


663
01:15:55.092 --> 01:15:58.222
- Bring him in alive. Go!
- That fucker's mine!


664
01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:00.510
- We'll get the bastard.
- Stay in touch on the radio.


665
01:16:00.592 --> 01:16:02.262
Get Dad up here with the dogs.

666
01:16:02.342 --> 01:16:06.302
We'll take this one up to the farm,
find out what the fuck is going on here.


667
01:16:06.383 --> 01:16:08.433
Right.

668
01:17:28.758 --> 01:17:31.928
Tell us what happened. Everything.

669
01:17:49.342 --> 01:17:52.092
We were stalking deer
for about an hour, okay?


670
01:17:53.133 --> 01:17:55.343
And we found one in a clearing.

671
01:17:55.425 --> 01:17:57.795
I lined up the shot.
I lined up the shot.


672
01:20:07.467 --> 01:20:12.217
Any idea how sick this is,
what you've done?


673
01:20:13.883 --> 01:20:15.593
Sorry.

674
01:20:17.217 --> 01:20:19.297
That's not gonna be enough.

675
01:20:23.633 --> 01:20:25.933
That's not gonna be nearly enough.

676
01:20:38.425 --> 01:20:40.905
How could you have done this to us?
How could you not tell us?


677
01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:51.800
You... with a child of your own
on the way.


678
01:20:57.925 --> 01:21:00.255
- I'm so sorry.
- Stop saying that.


679
01:21:20.258 --> 01:21:22.298
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.


680
01:21:23.883 --> 01:21:26.053
- He's not going anywhere.
- Sit down.


681
01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:29.588
We made a decision.
What, you don't think I want to?


682
01:21:39.675 --> 01:21:41.965
Well, let's get it done right now.

683
01:21:46.258 --> 01:21:50.128
- You're not thinking right, Brian.
- Oh, aye? And how's that?


684
01:21:52.967 --> 01:21:57.177
People know they came here.
His wife, for a start.


685
01:21:57.967 --> 01:22:01.587
Now, if we kill them, this place
will be riddled with police in no time.


686
01:22:01.675 --> 01:22:04.875
And I'm not talking local ones.
I'm talking real police.


687
01:22:05.717 --> 01:22:09.087
Last time anyone saw them was with us,
taking them out into the woods.


688
01:22:09.967 --> 01:22:13.717
Now, if we go through with this,
some of us'll go down for it,


689
01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.800
guaranteed, and for life.

690
01:22:20.592 --> 01:22:22.222
This place will never recover.

691
01:22:23.258 --> 01:22:25.468
And this family will be ripped apart.

692
01:22:28.383 --> 01:22:32.433
Now, I'm not saying I like it,
but it's time to get the police here.


693
01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.130
He's right.

694
01:22:39.258 --> 01:22:42.128
What real evidence have we got? Nothing.

695
01:22:42.217 --> 01:22:44.967
And he'll change his story
as soon as the fucking police get here.


696
01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:46.970
- No, I won't.
- He says that now.


697
01:22:47.050 --> 01:22:48.340
- I won't.
- Shut the fuck up.


698
01:22:48.425 --> 01:22:50.585
- Quiet.
- They walk away from this.


699
01:22:50.675 --> 01:22:54.215
- That cannae fucking happen.
- I said fucking quiet.


700
01:22:59.592 --> 01:23:02.512
I don't wanna hear another word
about police.


701
01:23:02.592 --> 01:23:04.762
After what he just confessed?

702
01:23:06.383 --> 01:23:09.633
After what came out the back
of that pick-up truck?


703
01:23:10.467 --> 01:23:12.717
After what these cunts have done here?

704
01:23:14.092 --> 01:23:17.052
The unthinkable things
they've done to our family?


705
01:23:26.758 --> 01:23:28.718
This can only be paid for in blood.

706
01:23:30.133 --> 01:23:33.933
We're not killers, brother.
We're not like them.


707
01:23:34.008 --> 01:23:36.128
An eye for an eye, Logan.

708
01:23:37.008 --> 01:23:41.548
After what they've done here,
they're not leaving here alive.


709
01:23:42.717 --> 01:23:46.127
For Christ's sake, stop this.

710
01:23:47.050 --> 01:23:49.930
- Think about what you're doing here.
- You've said your piece.


711
01:23:50.008 --> 01:23:53.338
Now step aside.

712
01:23:53.508 --> 01:23:55.338
- Angus...
- Logan, get out of my fucking way.


713
01:23:55.508 --> 01:23:57.298
- Frank, no.
- This is wrong.


714
01:23:57.383 --> 01:24:00.593
- I mean it. I'm warning you.
- It's the wrong thing to do.


715
01:24:00.675 --> 01:24:03.585
- Get him up.
- Brian! They've found the other one.


716
01:24:03.717 --> 01:24:05.927
They've got him!

717
01:24:07.967 --> 01:24:10.837
- Angus, get him in there.
- Get up.


718
01:24:12.133 --> 01:24:14.763
Get on your arse. Come on.

719
01:24:14.925 --> 01:24:16.215
Stay and watch him.

720
01:24:17.175 --> 01:24:20.585
Where is he? Vinny.

721
01:24:20.717 --> 01:24:22.627
We'll go and pick the other one up.

722
01:24:22.758 --> 01:24:25.258
We're gonna come back here
and finish this.


723
01:25:20.508 --> 01:25:22.838
A fucking kid! 
A fucking kid!

724
01:25:26.758 --> 01:25:29.758
You fucking tell them
what we've fucking done!


725
01:25:29.925 --> 01:25:31.335
What do you...

726
01:26:15.217 --> 01:26:17.337
Stop fucking moving.

727
01:26:28.883 --> 01:26:30.593
Come on.

728
01:27:02.092 --> 01:27:03.842
I've negotiated your life.

729
01:27:19.217 --> 01:27:20.717
But there's a debt to be paid.

730
01:27:35.675 --> 01:27:37.965
Don't think about doing anything stupid.

731
01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:39.970
You've got two guns
pointing at your head.


732
01:27:54.342 --> 01:27:56.432
Now do what needs to be done.

733
01:28:00.592 --> 01:28:02.842
Take it. Take it.

734
01:28:03.008 --> 01:28:04.628
No. No.

735
01:28:07.092 --> 01:28:10.552
Do it.
Come on, you can leave here alive.


736
01:28:10.633 --> 01:28:12.723
No. Fuck, no.

737
01:28:13.717 --> 01:28:15.677
Then you die here with him.

738
01:28:23.342 --> 01:28:26.632
- No, it's not right.
- Not right's a long way gone.


739
01:28:28.842 --> 01:28:30.932
Now do it.

740
01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:37.590
Do it or it's out of my control
and my brother will kill both of you.


741
01:29:07.092 --> 01:29:10.802
No, you can. Put it to your shoulder.
Put it to your shoulder.


742
01:29:10.883 --> 01:29:14.433
Son, son, just... just pick it up
and point it and pull the trigger.


743
01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:16.880
Pull the trigger.

744
01:29:17.967 --> 01:29:22.257
Do you really wanna leave your wife
and unborn child alone? Do you?


745
01:29:57.092 --> 01:29:58.762
Please.

746
01:30:06.175 --> 01:30:07.545
Please.

747
01:32:37.592 --> 01:32:39.432
Let's go through it again.

748
01:32:41.883 --> 01:32:44.203
Your wife picked you up.
And Marcus went north in his jeep.


749
01:32:51.008 --> 01:32:53.088
Marcus went north.

750
01:32:54.758 --> 01:32:56.678
Our relatives went missing.

751
01:32:59.592 --> 01:33:01.632
And we know nothing more.

752
01:33:03.592 --> 01:33:05.682
Nothing happened here.

753
01:33:07.925 --> 01:33:12.835
When the police come, keep your story
simple and make it convincing.


754
01:33:32.717 --> 01:33:34.797
What's happened? 
What's happened?

755
01:34:42.175 --> 01:34:44.255
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.


756
01:34:45.633 --> 01:34:47.593
You okay?

757
01:34:50.633 --> 01:34:52.723
I'll get him. You stay there.

758
01:35:15.425 --> 01:35:17.585
Hey, hey, hey. 
Come on, come on.

759
01:35:49.425 --> 01:35:56.585
