I was tailing you.

788
00:41:42.057 --> 00:41:43.825
Why were you tailing me, Troy?

789
00:41:44.424 --> 00:41:45.825
Because Joe asked me to.

790
00:41:48.391 --> 00:41:49.524
You know Joe.

791
00:41:50.257 --> 00:41:52.224
Likes to keep an eye
on his money.


792
00:41:53.824 --> 00:41:55.890
All night, that was you, huh?

793
00:41:56.524 --> 00:41:57.758
Aye.

794
00:41:58.458 --> 00:42:00.391
You fucked up the whole deal.

795
00:42:00.458 --> 00:42:02.658
I thought you were police.
I was gonna handle everything myself.

00:42:02.658 --> 00:42:04.558
I would have had
the fucking money!


797
00:42:05.057 --> 00:42:06.724
So you don't have the money.

798
00:42:08.157 --> 00:42:09.191

00:42:23.658 --> 00:42:25.791
I don't think there's

800
00:42:27.224 --> 00:42:29.424
I think, in fact, it's
more like five hundred quid.

I'm getting it.

802
00:42:31.658 --> 00:42:33.024

It's not good business.

If something happens to me,
Joe won't get his money back.


820
00:43:49.224 --> 00:43:51.257
I don't think
he was expecting to.


821
00:43:51.691 --> 00:43:53.658
Then why would he
give me the money?


822
00:43:54.057 --> 00:43:55.525
To make an example of you.

823
00:43:56.091 --> 00:43:58.757
Joe's worried
people think he's going soft.


824

No one thinks Joe's going soft.

825

Joe thinks it.
And that's enough.

about my wife?

You can be the message.

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:25.857
A fucking Halloween myth
around Newtownards


853

to scare the
wee scallies to sleep.

He's not a mate of yours.

He's just a man whose

risks harm to

First flight back to Kiev.

1573
01:27:40.424 --> 01:27:41.858
She wouldn't do that.

1574
01:27:42.524 --> 01:27:44.424
This girl played the long game.

1575
01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:46.224
It wasn't a game.

1576
01:27:49.157 --> 01:27:50.291
Thirty seconds.

1577
01:27:52.991 --> 01:27:54.891
You almost
pulled this off tonight.


1578
01:27:55.757 --> 01:27:57.723
You're a smart cunt,
I'll give you that.


1579
01:27:58.191 --> 01:28:01.657
But you always had this massive
blind spot for the birds.


1580
01:28:06.124 --> 01:28:08.224
I'm going to take you out
through the heart.


1581
01:28:08.757 --> 01:28:10.991
Because it's the heart
that took you out.


1582
01:28:11.357 --> 01:28:13.157
My heart's made of steel.

1583
01:28:14.357 --> 01:28:15.991
Forged by her hands.

1584
01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:18.690
Accept it.

1585
01:28:19.524 --> 01:28:21.191
[chuckle]

1586
01:28:22.257 --> 01:28:23.791
She didn't betray me.

1587
01:28:23.958 --> 01:28:25.791
She fucking did betray you.

1588
01:28:25.958 --> 01:28:28.091
I know you had a rough time
with your ex.


1589
01:28:28.157 --> 01:28:30.657
- What the fuck did you say about my wife?
- Nothing!


1590
01:28:30.690 --> 01:28:32.524
Nothing at all, just...

1591
01:28:32.723 --> 01:28:34.357
My girl is coming.

1592
01:28:37.657 --> 01:28:38.891
She's coming.

1593
01:28:40.224 --> 01:28:41.657
I know it.

1594
01:28:42.257 --> 01:28:44.257
[laughs]

1595
01:28:44.324 --> 01:28:45.690
Prove me wrong.

1596
01:28:46.224 --> 01:28:47.791
Just a little more time.

1597
01:28:52.791 --> 01:28:54.891
I'm gonna you thirty seconds.

1598
01:28:56.657 --> 01:28:58.191
Thirty seconds.

1599
01:28:59.157 --> 01:29:01.858
I'm disobeying an order
just to win the argument.


1600
01:29:02.791 --> 01:29:04.925
[phone vibrates]

1601
01:29:08.257 --> 01:29:09.291
That's Joe.

1602
01:29:09.958 --> 01:29:11.958
Checking to see
if you've been whacked.


1603
01:29:16.357 --> 01:29:17.858
This is how it ends, mate.

1604
01:29:18.657 --> 01:29:19.858
No bangs.

1605
01:29:20.491 --> 01:29:21.791
Just whimpers.

1606
01:29:30.324 --> 01:29:31.657
Last words.

1607
01:29:32.424 --> 01:29:33.458
What?

1608
01:29:33.690 --> 01:29:34.724
Last words.

1609
01:29:35.424 --> 01:29:38.257
I like to keep them
in a wee exercise book.


1610
01:29:38.491 --> 01:29:40.657
The songs of the silent choir.

1611
01:29:41.491 --> 01:29:42.791
Let's hear them.

1612
01:29:48.758 --> 01:29:54.191
[whispering in Ukrainian]

1613
01:29:55.657 --> 01:29:57.458
What the fuck are you saying?

1614
01:29:57.758 --> 01:29:59.191
Time is luck.

1615
01:29:59.257 --> 01:30:00.491
[tires screech]

1616
01:30:00.558 --> 01:30:03.291
[dramatic music]

1617
01:30:07.758 --> 01:30:09.191
[Troy] Stop right there!

1618
01:30:09.257 --> 01:30:10.657
I've got it.

1619
01:30:10.724 --> 01:30:12.357
I've got your money.

1620
01:30:19.558 --> 01:30:22.825
[music slows down]

1621
01:30:39.623 --> 01:30:40.590
[thud]

1622
01:30:40.658 --> 01:30:41.891
Count it.

1623
01:30:58.157 --> 01:30:59.257
One twenty.

1624
01:31:00.758 --> 01:31:03.724
- We healthy?
- I got the money. It's all there.


1625
01:31:04.257 --> 01:31:05.324
No.

1626
01:31:05.791 --> 01:31:07.291
I didn't shoot him.

1627
01:31:08.558 --> 01:31:10.357
I was showing initiative,
wasn't I?


1628
01:31:13.758 --> 01:31:15.658
He wants to speak to you.

1629
01:31:21.224 --> 01:31:23.724
[Joe] <i>Your friend
is being left by the towpath.</i>


1630
01:31:23.791 --> 01:31:24.957
Is he okay?

1631
01:31:25.024 --> 01:31:26.424
<i>He's walking, isn't he?</i>

1632
01:31:26.491 --> 01:31:27.990
<i>When do you guys open?</i>

1633
01:31:28.558 --> 01:31:30.357
Grand opening, two weeks.

1634
01:31:30.658 --> 01:31:31.825
<i>I've got a Hummer,</i>

1635
01:31:32.024 --> 01:31:33.558
<i>I want some
decal tints put in.</i>


1636
01:31:33.758 --> 01:31:34.990
Leave her by.

1637
01:31:35.658 --> 01:31:36.990
It'll cost you.

1638
01:31:38.391 --> 01:31:40.024
<i>I'm sure it will.</i>

1639
01:31:40.658 --> 01:31:41.890
Goodbye, Joe.

1640
01:31:53.658 --> 01:31:54.890
Next time...

1641
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:57.824
There won't be no next time.

1642
01:31:59.658 --> 01:32:00.824
[chuckle]

1643
01:32:25.424 --> 01:32:27.224
We still got the sixty?

1644
01:32:28.458 --> 01:32:30.724
I separated it in the van.

1645
01:32:37.291 --> 01:32:39.658
[soft singing]

1646
01:32:39.658 --> 01:32:41.957
Driving one-handed
on the motorway.


1647
01:32:44.191 --> 01:32:45.658
That's my girl.

1648
01:32:57.525 --> 01:32:59.024
[phone rings]

1649
01:33:04.391 --> 01:33:06.324
- [Graham] <i>You bastard son of a bitch.</i>
- Graham.


1650
01:33:06.391 --> 01:33:09.391
- <i>I pissed myself!</i>
- I got the money.


1651
01:33:09.458 --> 01:33:10.658
<i>Selfish...</i>

1652
01:33:10.691 --> 01:33:12.857
- <i>You what?</i>
- I got the sixty.


1653
01:33:13.357 --> 01:33:15.324
I have the sixty, Graham.

1654
01:33:15.525 --> 01:33:16.724
At my feet.

1655
01:33:17.324 --> 01:33:19.291
<i>Give me one
good fucking reason</i>


1656
01:33:19.357 --> 01:33:21.257
<i>why I shouldn't cut
all ties with you</i>


1657
01:33:21.324 --> 01:33:23.124
<i>after what you've
put me through?</i>


1658
01:33:23.191 --> 01:33:25.357
Let's have a moment
of candor, huh?


1659
01:33:26.424 --> 01:33:28.559
You entered into a business
relationship


1660
01:33:28.658 --> 01:33:31.224
with a man who's exiting
the drug trade.


1661
01:33:31.691 --> 01:33:32.723
Okay?

1662
01:33:33.357 --> 01:33:36.057
Now you might say it's because
you took a shine to me,


1663
01:33:36.124 --> 01:33:38.024
I might say it's
because you fancied


1664
01:33:38.091 --> 01:33:40.024
a walk on the dark side,
well...


1665
01:33:41.391 --> 01:33:42.957
You've had that tonight, mate.

1666
01:33:44.757 --> 01:33:46.257
And now you know it's not for
you,


1667
01:33:46.324 --> 01:33:47.658
and guess what?

1668
01:33:48.291 --> 01:33:49.559
[music picks up]

1669
01:33:49.658 --> 01:33:51.291
It's not for me either.

1670
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:54.658
'Cause now I'm out.

1671
01:33:55.291 --> 01:33:56.357
<i>You're out?</i>

1672
01:33:57.391 --> 01:33:59.024
I'm out.

1673
01:33:59.924 --> 01:34:01.924
<i>Nine a.m., at the bank.</i>

1674
01:34:02.291 --> 01:34:04.357
[music continues]

1675
01:35:44.257 --> 01:35:46.191
What's the story, boss?
I was about to clock off.


1676
01:35:46.257 --> 01:35:47.790
[Joe] <i>I got another job for
you.</i>


1677
01:35:47.857 --> 01:35:49.790
<i>A pair of hoods
called Lefty and Beaker.</i>


1678
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:51.790
<i>I need them sorted out.</i>

1679
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:55.224
<i>Your night's just about to
get started.</i>


1680
01:35:57.224 --> 01:35:58.358
What a night.

1681
01:36:02.257 --> 01:36:05.790
[music continues]

1682
