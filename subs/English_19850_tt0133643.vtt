1
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.570
Are you guys ready? Roll camera.

2
00:00:15.996 --> 00:00:18.984
Lisanne, 32A, magazine editor.

3
00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:23.160
- You want the bra off, too?
- Yeah.


4
00:00:23.995 --> 00:00:26.518
You're not showing my face, are you?

5
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.151
Okay, because I would die
if anyone knew I was doing this.


6
00:00:31.492 --> 00:00:32.719
Hold on.

7
00:00:36.261 --> 00:00:39.251
There! There you have it.
What do you want me to say?


8
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:42.520
How do you feel about your breasts?

9
00:00:42.595 --> 00:00:44.254
How do I feel about my breasts?

10
00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:48.054
How would you feel about them?

11
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.218
I've gone to the dentist and had tools
laid on my chest as though it was a tray.


12
00:00:53.293 --> 00:00:58.088
As though it was a totally flat place
upon which a person can...


13
00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.347
unthinkingly lay their things
and get them later.


14
00:01:01.992 --> 00:01:06.890
I know you don't like it that I'm getting
the operation because you're feminists.


15
00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:09.521
We're not trying to make
any judgments here.


16
00:01:09.592 --> 00:01:13.613
Okay. Good, because I don't care
if you did. I would just say, "Kiss my ass."


17
00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:16.782
I'm doing this for me
and I don't care what anybody says.


18
00:01:16.857 --> 00:01:18.881
I wanna have big tits.

19
00:01:24.124 --> 00:01:27.988
We now transmit you direct
to the laboratory of Captain Z-Ro.


20
00:01:28.057 --> 00:01:29.649
Please stand by.

21
00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:36.117
All right, Roger, set the location
and activate the view screen.


22
00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.388
There you are, Jet:

23
00:01:46.457 --> 00:01:50.015
The Great Pyramids of Egypt,
nearly 4,000 years old.


24
00:01:50.158 --> 00:01:52.314
How does he do it?

25
00:01:52.421 --> 00:01:55.389
Okay, Roger,
move to the chair and sit down.


26
00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:06.716
- Stand by to activate the time machine.
- Yes, sir.


27
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.218
Set it for the year 2000 BC.

28
00:02:11.154 --> 00:02:13.086
Bring up the voltage to one million.

29
00:02:13.188 --> 00:02:16.211
Thermo gauge: 40.5.
Stand by to activate the reactor.


30
00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:17.411
Yes, sir.

31
00:02:21.186 --> 00:02:22.618
- Petro?
- Yes, Captain.


32
00:02:22.688 --> 00:02:27.644
Stand by to operate the time machine.
Set it at 991.875.


33
00:02:30.088 --> 00:02:33.280
That's awfully high.
Where in the world are you going?


34
00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:36.115
Back to the Great Pyramid of Giza,
in the year 2000 BC.


35
00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:38.550
- Stand by for signals.
- Yes, sir.


36
00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:45.112
I'm separating the alveolus
from the vomer.


37
00:02:45.384 --> 00:02:46.906
What do I need?

38
00:02:47.352 --> 00:02:49.341
- You would need the...
- No, Steve.


39
00:02:49.452 --> 00:02:50.476
Kevin?

40
00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.416
- Kevin?
- Sir?


41
00:02:55.886 --> 00:02:57.246
Never mind.

42
00:02:57.915 --> 00:03:00.247
That's all right.
Go back to what you were doing.


43
00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:01.940
It's peculiar...

44
00:03:02.318 --> 00:03:06.717
I have this 12-year-old boy here,
we've got an aponeurosis of the velum.


45
00:03:07.418 --> 00:03:12.146
Since he's here at this operating room,
why don't we give him some of that...


46
00:03:12.217 --> 00:03:14.943
What do you call it? 
Medical attention.

47
00:03:15.182 --> 00:03:17.274
- Aufricht retractor?
- Today!


48
00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.783
- What's that?
- What is what?


49
00:03:23.318 --> 00:03:26.282
- What's that you're holding?
- An aufricht retractor.


50
00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:29.545
- Really?
- I made some modifications to it.


51
00:03:30.316 --> 00:03:33.307
I integrated a spring-tension device
that makes it easier...


52
00:03:33.783 --> 00:03:36.147
An aufricht retractor, you idiot!

53
00:03:36.384 --> 00:03:38.404
A real aufricht retractor!

54
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:40.747
Aufricht retractor.

55
00:03:41.783 --> 00:03:43.112
Thank you.

56
00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.037
Did I ask you
to modify it? Did I?

57
00:03:47.847 --> 00:03:51.710
No, I told you
to fetch it, you moron.

58
00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:56.247
Asshole!

59
00:03:56.548 --> 00:03:59.911
- Watch your language.
- What a degrading sadist!


60
00:04:00.348 --> 00:04:04.209
That's it. After my rotation,
I'm out of here. I'm going to Thoracics.


61
00:04:04.278 --> 00:04:06.939
Do you have any idea
what Debakey's doing over there?


62
00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:09.309
He's building an artificial heart.

63
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.675
Yeah, an artificial heart!
Debakey has 28 patents to his name.


64
00:04:12.746 --> 00:04:17.336
How many does Larson have?
None. Zero patents, the bastard!


65
00:04:17.412 --> 00:04:18.878
Watch your mouth!

66
00:04:18.946 --> 00:04:22.935
Debakey doesn't treat his people like this.
He treats his people like people...


67
00:04:23.044 --> 00:04:25.875
as evidenced
by not being such an asshole.


68
00:04:28.313 --> 00:04:30.402
May I have a word with you?

69
00:04:36.444 --> 00:04:39.469
As a figure of
authority and as a mentor...

70
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.300
I've come to tolerate an amount
of ignorant disdain from my residents.


71
00:04:43.376 --> 00:04:44.363
About what I said...

72
00:04:44.443 --> 00:04:49.400
But I expect, if not the real thing,
at least a pretense of grudging respect.


73
00:04:49.645 --> 00:04:54.043
- I didn't mean it. All right, Dr. Larson?
- I had some very high hopes in you.


74
00:04:54.177 --> 00:04:56.200
I thought I could teach you something.

75
00:04:56.277 --> 00:04:59.571
I shouldn't have done it during surgery,
but with my adjustments...


76
00:04:59.642 --> 00:05:02.131
I thought I could make a difference.

77
00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:06.471
You wanna move over to Thoracics?
You wanna swagger in the limelight.


78
00:05:06.544 --> 00:05:09.441
The artificial heart, the fancy building,
and so forth?


79
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.134
That's not it.

80
00:05:11.573 --> 00:05:13.972
It ain't enough
to give a boy back his smile.


81
00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:15.837
They saved his life.

82
00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:20.069
What's it matter if he spends it in a closet
with a bag over his head?


83
00:05:20.176 --> 00:05:23.333
- They call us beauticians.
- What?


84
00:05:23.707 --> 00:05:26.732
Plastic surgeons, they call us beauticians.

85
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.965
- Who does?
- Everybody does.


86
00:05:34.908 --> 00:05:39.669
- You mean residents?
- Residents, nurses, doctors, everybody.


87
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.570
- Are you gonna fire me?
- No.


88
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:47.940
In what context
do they call us beauticians?


89
00:05:48.142 --> 00:05:50.934
I don't know. It's
just a joke, I guess.

90
00:05:51.005 --> 00:05:54.905
- I thought you knew about it.
- Beauticians like a woman hairdresser?


91
00:05:54.974 --> 00:05:57.237
Or like some goddamn nail painter?

92
00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:58.933
I don't know what they mean.

93
00:05:59.006 --> 00:06:01.767
- Hi, Dave, Louis.
- Hello, Bill.


94
00:06:08.173 --> 00:06:11.297
- Listen, about what I said in there...
- Forget it.


95
00:06:11.472 --> 00:06:13.132
I'll want to remove those walls.

96
00:06:14.473 --> 00:06:17.492
- The kitchen, too small.
- Too small?


97
00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:20.002
You cannot cook in this kitchen.

98
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.033
- What about a French window there?
- French windows.


99
00:06:24.438 --> 00:06:26.371
That's a great idea.

100
00:06:26.805 --> 00:06:28.203
I like that.

101
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.896
Come on in
and look at Patrice's new drawings.


102
00:06:40.103 --> 00:06:41.535
Sure, honey.

103
00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:47.335
I think I'll take a look at them as soon
as you figure out how to pay for them.


104
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.727
Actually, I have plans tonight.

105
00:06:58.267 --> 00:07:00.462
How about some other time this week?

106
00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:06.324
Actually, I'm gonna be busy all week.
But maybe some time after that?


107
00:07:08.036 --> 00:07:09.794
Okay. That sounds great.

108
00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:12.089
- Okay.
- Okay.


109
00:07:12.334 --> 00:07:13.595
Goodbye.

110
00:07:16.467 --> 00:07:18.696
- Who was that?
- That was Kevin.


111
00:07:18.901 --> 00:07:20.422
Kevin Saunders?

112
00:07:21.034 --> 00:07:22.126
Yeah.

113
00:07:22.632 --> 00:07:24.154
What did he want?

114
00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:26.824
He wanted a date.

115
00:07:28.233 --> 00:07:29.722
Hi, Kevin.

116
00:07:39.098 --> 00:07:40.826
Look at this. Look at that.

117
00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:42.558
It's a padded bra.

118
00:07:43.832 --> 00:07:45.458
And this. Hold on.

119
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.260
"The Pump." Look at how that works.

120
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:52.994
And it's "doctor recommended."

121
00:07:53.565 --> 00:07:55.587
Just hold on. And creams.

122
00:07:55.933 --> 00:07:59.331
"Breast Enhancement Cream.
It will be our little secret."


123
00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:01.229
I gotta make my rounds.

124
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.228
Would you just hear me out?

125
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.596
You're healing very nicely.

126
00:08:05.664 --> 00:08:09.462
- Why? Just give me one reason...
- I'll have a nurse change that bandage.


127
00:08:10.765 --> 00:08:14.821
All I'm saying is this could open up
a whole new world of medicine.


128
00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:17.595
- What, breasts?
- Why not?


129
00:08:17.863 --> 00:08:22.762
If Debakey can build a better heart,
why can't we build a better breast?


130
00:08:26.197 --> 00:08:28.253
George, are you all right?

131
00:08:28.497 --> 00:08:30.085
I'm okay, Spinner.

132
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:32.492
Hello, Raquel!

133
00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:34.925
Hello, Dr. Larson.

134
00:08:35.728 --> 00:08:39.025
- How are you?
- Pretty good. How you doing today?


135
00:08:39.096 --> 00:08:40.392
Pretty good.

136
00:08:40.463 --> 00:08:43.913
- This is Dr. Saunders.
- Hello.


137
00:08:43.993 --> 00:08:47.016
Would you mind
showing him your breasts, please?


138
00:08:47.094 --> 00:08:52.050
Raquel had polyvinyl Ivalon sponges
implanted in 1959.


139
00:08:54.896 --> 00:08:56.382
What happened?

140
00:08:56.859 --> 00:09:00.122
The porous sponges encouraged
fibrous tissue to grow into them.


141
00:09:00.294 --> 00:09:01.625
We're taking them out tomorrow.

142
00:09:01.694 --> 00:09:05.923
We're concerned the polyvinyl
releases carcinogens as it breaks down.


143
00:09:06.562 --> 00:09:09.887
That stuff belongs in automobile seats,
not people.


144
00:09:10.393 --> 00:09:12.883
They were real nice for six months.

145
00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.390
- Thank you, Raquel.
- Sure.


146
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.188
They don't teach it in medical school...

147
00:09:22.258 --> 00:09:27.123
but there have been plenty of doctors
who've tried everything from paraffin to...


148
00:09:27.193 --> 00:09:30.521
glass balls in an attempt
to make bigger breasts.


149
00:09:31.326 --> 00:09:33.154
They were successful in maiming.

150
00:09:33.225 --> 00:09:36.553
They were excellent at disfiguring
and killing their patients.


151
00:09:36.623 --> 00:09:38.418
But, on the whole...

152
00:09:39.226 --> 00:09:43.384
I think you'd have to say the results
were pretty terribly mixed.


153
00:09:46.525 --> 00:09:49.818
Terri, 34A, dental hygienist.

154
00:09:50.455 --> 00:09:53.286
That little snap of the bra clasp opening...

155
00:09:53.956 --> 00:09:57.821
which to the guy, I assume,
represents some rush of erotic victory.


156
00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.082
A sound which should be a happy sound...

157
00:10:00.557 --> 00:10:03.918
creates in me a feeling
of horror and panic so acute...


158
00:10:03.988 --> 00:10:05.886
I have an impulse to scream.

159
00:10:07.223 --> 00:10:08.780
What's so funny?

160
00:10:08.857 --> 00:10:12.311
I'm sorry. It's just the way you said that,
it was funny.


161
00:10:14.857 --> 00:10:16.844
It wasn't so funny to me.

162
00:10:27.621 --> 00:10:28.847
Thank you.

163
00:10:36.888 --> 00:10:41.510
- I think Kennedy's really got him this time.
- Castro's gone out of his mind.


164
00:10:43.152 --> 00:10:45.779
Last Tuesday morning at 9:00 AM...

165
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.747
I directed that our surveillance
be stepped up.


166
00:10:49.819 --> 00:10:54.616
Having now confirmed and completed
our evaluation of the evidence...


167
00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:57.746
and our decision on a course of action...

168
00:10:57.817 --> 00:11:02.773
this government feels obliged to report
this new crisis to you in fullest detail.


169
00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:06.384
The characteristics
of these new missile sites...


170
00:12:27.283 --> 00:12:28.405
Hello.

171
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.472
I'm Dr. Saunders
from the Texas Medical Center.


172
00:12:34.213 --> 00:12:37.906
Hello, Dr. Saunders
from the Texas Medical Center.


173
00:12:41.777 --> 00:12:43.836
I know this sounds like a line...

174
00:12:44.112 --> 00:12:48.739
but I'm working on a medical project
and I would like to enlist your help.


175
00:12:54.309 --> 00:12:58.936
You said you were a doctor.
I thought doctors had lots of money.


176
00:13:00.077 --> 00:13:02.270
I just finished my residency.

177
00:13:05.046 --> 00:13:07.440
So you can't write prescriptions?

178
00:13:08.109 --> 00:13:09.769
Why, are you sick?

179
00:13:17.745 --> 00:13:20.675
- What is that?
- It's a dental alginate mold.


180
00:13:22.108 --> 00:13:25.007
It looks like oatmeal.

181
00:13:26.809 --> 00:13:29.606
Yeah, actually. 
But you can't eat it.

182
00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:34.633
Don't worry, it washes right off the skin.

183
00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:39.531
Do you wanna take off your sweater?

184
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.596
Okay...

185
00:14:15.238 --> 00:14:17.465
Here, sit. Would you, please?

186
00:14:22.973 --> 00:14:25.064
Take this towel and
put it on your lap.

187
00:14:31.005 --> 00:14:32.266
Okay.

188
00:14:35.206 --> 00:14:36.866
Here we go.

189
00:14:37.207 --> 00:14:39.570
- It's cold!
- I'm sorry.


190
00:14:42.271 --> 00:14:43.531
Okay?

191
00:14:47.405 --> 00:14:52.360
So all of these women are gonna be
walking around with my boobs?


192
00:14:56.669 --> 00:14:57.897
I suppose.

193
00:15:01.006 --> 00:15:03.901
Maybe after this
we can go bowling or something.


194
00:15:06.571 --> 00:15:11.297
- I have this thing that I'm doing.
- Okay.


195
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:43.064
Go ahead, squeeze it.

196
00:15:43.235 --> 00:15:44.758
Go ahead, just squeeze it.

197
00:15:46.535 --> 00:15:48.191
Squeeze it, come on!

198
00:15:52.366 --> 00:15:55.266
Doesn't it feel exactly like a real breast?

199
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.664
- How the hell would you know?
- Come on, I'm serious.


200
00:15:59.734 --> 00:16:01.322
And it's safe.

201
00:16:01.898 --> 00:16:06.855
Even if it broke, it's filled with salt water,
which the body can absorb harmlessly.


202
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.562
Have you thought about
what people might say?


203
00:16:10.932 --> 00:16:11.921
What?

204
00:16:12.099 --> 00:16:14.586
You're not in Chicago anymore.

205
00:16:15.596 --> 00:16:19.551
A male doctor coming up with a way
to make women's breasts bigger?


206
00:16:19.631 --> 00:16:21.394
I think they'd say thank you.

207
00:16:21.466 --> 00:16:24.260
Think of all the women
who aren't happy with themselves...


208
00:16:24.331 --> 00:16:26.761
or the women who've had mastectomies...

209
00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:30.455
or whose breasts have been distorted
by breastfeeding.


210
00:16:31.963 --> 00:16:33.452
When I think of my own mother...

211
00:16:33.663 --> 00:16:37.028
All right, that's enough. 
Just spare me.

212
00:16:39.432 --> 00:16:41.450
Your mother's breasts?

213
00:16:42.328 --> 00:16:44.624
A man can only take so much.

214
00:16:50.865 --> 00:16:54.055
Over there by the bar,
they'd be over the moon if you said hello.


215
00:16:54.128 --> 00:16:58.288
- Honey, I see them every day.
- Honey, he's a cardiologist!


216
00:16:59.295 --> 00:17:00.455
Bye.

217
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.855
- What's the matter, William?
- Why, hello, Frank, Michael.


218
00:17:12.928 --> 00:17:16.452
How you doing? Quite a party!
I hear they popped $10,000 on it.


219
00:17:16.527 --> 00:17:18.858
There's Debakey,
over there by the ice heart.


220
00:17:19.062 --> 00:17:20.684
How appropriate.

221
00:17:21.426 --> 00:17:24.948
I heard he had some guy the other day
with a perfectly good heart...


222
00:17:25.026 --> 00:17:28.085
who wanted to swap it out
for a man-made one.


223
00:17:29.094 --> 00:17:30.218
Simple.

224
00:17:30.293 --> 00:17:34.452
You know who that is?
That's Mitch Heilman, the astronaut.


225
00:17:34.525 --> 00:17:38.012
- He's short.
- They're doing amazing things at NASA.


226
00:17:38.359 --> 00:17:42.087
I used some of that technology
to create a simplified dialysis procedure.


227
00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:45.724
My team's just come up with a new way
of mapping neurons in the brain.


228
00:17:45.794 --> 00:17:49.518
They're gonna write that up
in next month's Scientific Journal.


229
00:17:49.992 --> 00:17:52.514
What's new in plastic surgery?

230
00:17:57.427 --> 00:18:00.652
I've developed a new aufricht retractor.

231
00:18:01.826 --> 00:18:04.484
Did you find the old one inadequate?

232
00:18:21.924 --> 00:18:23.082
Hey, Dr. Larson.

233
00:18:23.423 --> 00:18:25.253
Anybody sitting here?

234
00:18:25.391 --> 00:18:27.752
- No, by all means.
- Thank you.


235
00:18:39.454 --> 00:18:43.045
The edges are sharp,
they'll irritate the tissue.


236
00:18:44.687 --> 00:18:45.914
What?

237
00:18:46.221 --> 00:18:49.086
For your breasts,
the edges will irritate the tissue.


238
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.848
An injection molding press could fix that.

239
00:18:57.654 --> 00:19:00.849
- What's the shell composed of?
- A polymer mixture.


240
00:19:02.155 --> 00:19:04.019
That's not gonna work.

241
00:19:04.522 --> 00:19:06.610
You need an inert material.

242
00:19:09.519 --> 00:19:12.917
I got a friend in Michigan
who might be able to help us with this.


243
00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:16.582
Help us out? What are you saying?

244
00:19:16.953 --> 00:19:20.076
I'm saying let's see if
we can make it work.

245
00:19:22.151 --> 00:19:24.912
This is Kevin Saunders
and Dr. William Larson...


246
00:19:24.985 --> 00:19:27.474
the men who are going to build us
a better bosom.


247
00:19:27.719 --> 00:19:31.550
Only one question:
How do I get on the testing committee?


248
00:19:40.752 --> 00:19:42.047
Go ahead.

249
00:19:42.718 --> 00:19:44.117
Open it.

250
00:19:47.849 --> 00:19:50.644
I let our chemists take a look
at the prosthesis you sent...


251
00:19:50.716 --> 00:19:53.205
and they made some modifications.

252
00:19:53.283 --> 00:19:56.773
They constructed the shell membrane
out of a silicone polymer.


253
00:19:56.851 --> 00:19:58.681
We're thinking of calling it the Larson.

254
00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:03.078
Is that a joke?

255
00:20:03.215 --> 00:20:04.681
We'll talk about it later.

256
00:20:04.749 --> 00:20:06.739
It's all negotiable down the road.

257
00:20:06.817 --> 00:20:10.251
You'll receive a generous royalty
of each prosthesis sold.


258
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:14.007
My lawyers handling that,
but the operative word is "generous."


259
00:20:14.248 --> 00:20:15.407
What have you got in here?

260
00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:19.778
It's filled with a medical-grade silicone gel,
also completely safe.


261
00:20:20.016 --> 00:20:22.880
We agreed it would be filled
with saltwater solution.


262
00:20:22.949 --> 00:20:27.004
We tried that but the R&D guy said
it rippled and sloshed around.


263
00:20:28.648 --> 00:20:30.670
Silicone gel. That's the answer.

264
00:20:30.747 --> 00:20:34.874
It has the same viscosity as breast tissue
and a gravity less than water.


265
00:20:34.947 --> 00:20:37.915
No one will know whether
they're man-made or a gift from God!


266
00:20:38.979 --> 00:20:40.708
But is it safe?

267
00:20:41.079 --> 00:20:42.739
It's 100 percent safe.

268
00:20:42.813 --> 00:20:47.371
We originally developed silicone for use as
an insulating material during World War II.


269
00:20:47.813 --> 00:20:50.440
We couldn't even keep it
on the Navy docks in Okinawa.


270
00:20:50.647 --> 00:20:53.110
Turns out the Japs
were stealing the stuff...


271
00:20:53.179 --> 00:20:55.871
and injecting it directly
into women's breasts.


272
00:20:56.279 --> 00:20:59.142
But they were using
industrial-grade liquid silicone.


273
00:20:59.212 --> 00:21:02.305
There's a great deal of health risk
involved in that process.


274
00:21:02.381 --> 00:21:05.037
We filled these
with medical-grade silicone gel...


275
00:21:05.212 --> 00:21:09.906
and enclosed it in an indestructible,
inert, non-reactive silastic bag.


276
00:21:09.979 --> 00:21:12.537
- It won't break down?
- It will not break down.


277
00:21:12.613 --> 00:21:14.375
We've got the patent on silicone.

278
00:21:14.447 --> 00:21:16.640
You've got something
born to be made out of it.


279
00:21:16.714 --> 00:21:19.337
It's the perfect marriage
of industry and medicine.


280
00:21:19.877 --> 00:21:21.809
Arlene, Mary Kay rep.

281
00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.668
Can I borrow your pencil?

282
00:21:26.345 --> 00:21:30.608
This is called the pencil test.
It's supposed to fall to the floor.


283
00:21:31.145 --> 00:21:32.802
I love my children...

284
00:21:32.878 --> 00:21:37.206
but I'm a little resentful about
what they did to my breasts. Thanks.


285
00:21:37.276 --> 00:21:40.208
It's like someone blew up a balloon
and let all the air out.


286
00:21:42.078 --> 00:21:45.007
Mastectomies, breastfeeding...

287
00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:51.839
We talk as doctors...

288
00:21:52.077 --> 00:21:54.474
in terms of the tangible
and the empirical...


289
00:21:54.543 --> 00:21:57.941
but now I ask you to consider
the psychological...


290
00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:02.128
the mental aspects
and then the opportunities that we have.


291
00:22:03.407 --> 00:22:08.171
It's a low-risk operation that can be done
inexpensively and quickly...


292
00:22:08.509 --> 00:22:11.203
as both a reconstruction
and an augmentation...


293
00:22:11.277 --> 00:22:14.468
to the betterment of the...

294
00:22:14.907 --> 00:22:18.772
overall self-esteem...

295
00:22:19.475 --> 00:22:22.409
to the women who get it.

296
00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:26.498
We can usher in
a whole new world of medicine here.


297
00:22:34.007 --> 00:22:35.099
Bill.

298
00:22:36.442 --> 00:22:38.030
I don't know where to start...

299
00:22:38.105 --> 00:22:40.798
- If you don't mind...
- I'd like to finish.


300
00:22:40.939 --> 00:22:44.428
What Dave is trying to say,
what we're all trying to say here...


301
00:22:44.505 --> 00:22:48.904
is while we are touched
by your altruism...


302
00:22:49.006 --> 00:22:53.267
- We're doctors and we cure people.
- We're not expensive beauticians...


303
00:22:53.404 --> 00:22:55.336
who like to play with bosoms.

304
00:22:55.404 --> 00:22:58.200
You may not understand
the despair these women endure.


305
00:23:00.337 --> 00:23:01.236
The women...

306
00:23:01.339 --> 00:23:03.931
If God wants a woman
to have big breasts...


307
00:23:04.469 --> 00:23:06.401
he gives her big breasts.

308
00:23:07.202 --> 00:23:10.192
That is what
we're talking about here, isn't it?


309
00:23:10.337 --> 00:23:14.431
Does that mean
that we shouldn't correct clubfeet?


310
00:23:16.105 --> 00:23:19.295
Quiet, Dave.
What I find ironic about your stupidity...


311
00:23:19.368 --> 00:23:22.664
is you know what women go through
who've had this procedure done!


312
00:23:22.735 --> 00:23:25.066
That's the irony here!

313
00:23:25.904 --> 00:23:29.860
The fact that women have tried for so long
to increase their breast size...


314
00:23:29.937 --> 00:23:31.523
that underscores...

315
00:23:33.234 --> 00:23:36.031
you know, that this can be done safely!

316
00:23:36.502 --> 00:23:40.365
Just because you've got
some deranged fixation with breasts.


317
00:23:41.436 --> 00:23:45.060
Once you've finished with your strippers...

318
00:23:45.535 --> 00:23:48.295
and your prostitutes...

319
00:23:49.901 --> 00:23:53.095
what respectable woman's
gonna pay for this?


320
00:23:59.333 --> 00:24:01.960
I think, Louis, that if she knew...

321
00:24:02.034 --> 00:24:05.361
how you were behaving
with some of your nurses...


322
00:24:05.766 --> 00:24:07.732
perhaps your wife might be...

323
00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.131
You wanna step outside?

324
00:24:09.667 --> 00:24:12.530
Let me go, 'cause
I'm gonna whip his ass!

325
00:24:12.699 --> 00:24:14.789
- Calm down.
- We can go right there...


326
00:24:14.899 --> 00:24:16.195
Calm down!

327
00:24:17.466 --> 00:24:19.329
Dr. Larson, get out of here.

328
00:24:20.166 --> 00:24:22.396
If you feel froggy, just jump!

329
00:24:24.731 --> 00:24:25.788
Queer.

330
00:24:27.698 --> 00:24:30.029
Myopic pretentious idiots.

331
00:24:30.098 --> 00:24:31.224
What did they say?

332
00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.788
Forget them.
We don't need their damned approval.


333
00:24:33.867 --> 00:24:35.389
What happened?

334
00:24:37.099 --> 00:24:40.086
You know what?
We're gonna do it without them.


335
00:24:41.164 --> 00:24:42.220
How?

336
00:24:44.365 --> 00:24:45.853
With my money.

337
00:24:47.097 --> 00:24:48.655
With my money.

338
00:24:50.232 --> 00:24:53.129
You just go out there
and find us the woman.


339
00:25:14.897 --> 00:25:16.830
- Lola?
- Yeah?


340
00:25:19.161 --> 00:25:21.626
- Are you going out?
- Yeah.


341
00:25:23.827 --> 00:25:25.726
My associate and I...

342
00:25:25.796 --> 00:25:28.820
we've been working on
a new medical procedure...


343
00:25:29.496 --> 00:25:33.290
by which we actually increase
the size of the breast.


344
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.125
I thought you might wanna be the first.

345
00:25:39.195 --> 00:25:42.822
What we do: We take a small cut,
like a small incision...


346
00:25:42.897 --> 00:25:46.188
What makes you think I'd be interested
in something like that?


347
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.690
They'll be bigger.

348
00:25:56.761 --> 00:26:00.850
- You're a disgusting little peeper.
- It's all right, I'm a doctor.


349
00:26:00.925 --> 00:26:03.414
I thought you might ask me out,
which is bad enough.


350
00:26:03.492 --> 00:26:06.821
But you wanna cut holes in me
and stick bags of goo in my chest?


351
00:26:06.892 --> 00:26:09.655
Stay away from me, creep!

352
00:26:15.825 --> 00:26:16.982
Hello.

353
00:26:17.858 --> 00:26:20.823
Good afternoon.
I realize this may sound...


354
00:26:23.426 --> 00:26:26.855
I'm with the... I'm Dr. Saunders, I'm sorry.

355
00:26:27.057 --> 00:26:30.922
I'm with the Texas Medical Center
and we're working on a new procedure.


356
00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:33.549
We increase the size of...

357
00:26:34.224 --> 00:26:36.022
What we're doing is, my partner and I...

358
00:26:36.226 --> 00:26:40.952
Dr. Larson, have just developed
a new technique, a medical procedure...


359
00:26:41.822 --> 00:26:43.153
Hello. Excuse me.

360
00:26:44.624 --> 00:26:46.113
What a day.

361
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:48.589
Are you happy with your existing breasts?

362
00:26:48.725 --> 00:26:50.654
to increase the breast.

363
00:26:50.721 --> 00:26:52.687
You know how some people
wanna be first...


364
00:26:52.754 --> 00:26:55.414
to do something?
This is your opportunity.


365
00:26:55.488 --> 00:26:58.716
I don't know if you
think about your breasts.


366
00:27:01.957 --> 00:27:04.615
It's for the breasts. 
I like your hat.

367
00:27:05.056 --> 00:27:07.145
It's a medical procedure.

368
00:27:07.422 --> 00:27:09.718
Like I said, you can be bigger.

369
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.284
Is that "no" as in "no questions"?

370
00:27:15.323 --> 00:27:16.516
I'm sorry!

371
00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.781
I am a doctor.

372
00:27:20.854 --> 00:27:24.308
I'm with the Texas Medical Center
and we're doing a...


373
00:27:30.885 --> 00:27:32.851
Put that disgusting thing away.

374
00:27:33.952 --> 00:27:38.908
If you wanted to help people,
you could cure back pain or arthritis!


375
00:27:39.086 --> 00:27:40.416
All right, I'm sorry.

376
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.109
Making women's breasts larger?

377
00:27:43.284 --> 00:27:46.807
- I'm sorry.
- I think it's sick. I do.


378
00:27:47.051 --> 00:27:50.577
I think it's very sick.
Something's wrong with you.


379
00:27:51.419 --> 00:27:52.511
I'm sorry.

380
00:27:52.587 --> 00:27:54.881
Put it away!

381
00:27:59.518 --> 00:28:01.882
I'm just very disappointed.

382
00:28:09.319 --> 00:28:10.749
Hey, Laura.

383
00:28:13.249 --> 00:28:14.909
Can I see it?

384
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.878
Can I see the thing?

385
00:28:27.948 --> 00:28:29.279
I mean...

386
00:28:32.015 --> 00:28:36.446
For what it is,
it actually looks pretty good.

387
00:28:38.547 --> 00:28:39.877
Put it away.

388
00:28:43.548 --> 00:28:46.481
Okay, I only say this to you
as a friend, but...


389
00:28:46.783 --> 00:28:47.908
Wipe your mouth.

390
00:28:47.982 --> 00:28:52.140
This whole business of this solicitation...

391
00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.208
it isn't doing any wonders
for your reputation.


392
00:28:57.515 --> 00:28:59.004
I was just sitting here...

393
00:28:59.082 --> 00:29:03.568
Carrying that around and asking women,
it just comes across as perverse.


394
00:29:03.645 --> 00:29:06.135
If you wished that
something about you was different...


395
00:29:06.213 --> 00:29:09.374
and there was a way you could do it,
wouldn't you do it?


396
00:29:09.447 --> 00:29:14.379
Possibly. It's the way that
you go about things.


397
00:29:15.248 --> 00:29:18.108
I mean, it's an appealing idea, sort of.

398
00:29:18.178 --> 00:29:20.610
I'm sure there are
plenty of women out there...


399
00:29:20.679 --> 00:29:23.576
who would love to have bigger breasts.

400
00:29:31.545 --> 00:29:33.240
Do you want the operation?

401
00:29:34.543 --> 00:29:37.634
- Is that a joke?
- No, you said it was an appealing idea.


402
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.610
- Are you insulting me?
- No.


403
00:29:39.679 --> 00:29:42.699
I am a nurse. I am a professional.

404
00:29:43.009 --> 00:29:46.066
I do not need
to be insulted by you.

405
00:29:46.576 --> 00:29:48.908
I was trying to
be nice and help you.

406
00:29:58.176 --> 00:29:59.403
Shut up.

407
00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:04.510
I come from a stoic Calvinist background.

408
00:30:04.644 --> 00:30:07.540
You didn't complain unless
something was drastically wrong...


409
00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.096
like a broken leg or lung cancer.

410
00:30:10.441 --> 00:30:12.067
I feel crippled.

411
00:30:12.142 --> 00:30:14.973
I can't go to the beach.
I can't get clothes that fit.


412
00:30:15.043 --> 00:30:17.974
I can't find a man. Hell, 
I look like a man.

413
00:30:18.108 --> 00:30:21.507
Gloria Steinem says breasts
are unimportant because she's got them.


414
00:30:21.742 --> 00:30:25.866
For God's sake, a surgeon doesn't buckle
when he encounters resistance.


415
00:30:25.941 --> 00:30:30.567
This isn't resistance. These women,
I'm getting anger, they hate me.


416
00:30:30.641 --> 00:30:32.436
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.


417
00:30:33.174 --> 00:30:34.697
I'm Dr. Larson.

418
00:30:37.674 --> 00:30:40.035
You're Miss Lindsey?

419
00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:44.499
I understand you have some tattoos
you'd like removed.


420
00:30:44.574 --> 00:30:47.904
Yes, right here.
My ex-husband bought them for me.


421
00:30:48.407 --> 00:30:50.270
How old is the tattoo?

422
00:30:53.438 --> 00:30:56.770
Eight or nine years...
It's about 10 years old.


423
00:30:58.307 --> 00:31:02.069
God, they look like they haven't been
watered since I got them.


424
00:31:02.138 --> 00:31:03.330
Pardon?

425
00:31:05.005 --> 00:31:07.937
It's just kind of embarrassing,
'cause I've had six kids...


426
00:31:08.006 --> 00:31:10.029
and they're sagging.

427
00:31:10.907 --> 00:31:15.032
In fact, my ex-husband used to say
that I had a couple of flat feet.


428
00:31:15.105 --> 00:31:16.865
Can you believe that?

429
00:31:19.704 --> 00:31:20.761
What?

430
00:31:24.504 --> 00:31:27.904
A transverse incision...

431
00:31:28.005 --> 00:31:30.492
on the patient's right breast.

432
00:31:33.838 --> 00:31:37.291
- You want bigger scissors?
- Please. Thank you.


433
00:31:43.702 --> 00:31:45.997
A little larger cut...

434
00:31:46.069 --> 00:31:49.330
to accommodate the implant.

435
00:31:49.402 --> 00:31:51.232
Let's sponge that off.

436
00:31:53.937 --> 00:31:58.367
Going through the subcutaneous tissue
to the pectoralis fascia.


437
00:31:58.501 --> 00:32:00.763
A little suction.

438
00:32:00.868 --> 00:32:03.165
A little bit of a bleeder here.

439
00:32:05.069 --> 00:32:06.296
Come on.

440
00:32:07.403 --> 00:32:10.798
Do some finger dissection here
to open up the pocket.


441
00:32:11.066 --> 00:32:13.761
A little tight squeeze, but...

442
00:32:14.335 --> 00:32:15.358
Oh, boy.

443
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.762
The strong use of finger dissection here...

444
00:32:25.067 --> 00:32:28.794
to open up the pocket, that's used
medially, laterally and superiorly.


445
00:32:28.867 --> 00:32:30.765
This is absurd! 
Would you excuse us?

446
00:32:30.834 --> 00:32:33.426
The implant is inserted.

447
00:32:34.335 --> 00:32:36.890
The incision is closed bilaterally using...

448
00:32:36.966 --> 00:32:40.728
a running-lock 3-0 nylon suture.

449
00:32:40.867 --> 00:32:42.558
The patients are told to abstain...

450
00:32:42.632 --> 00:32:46.030
from vigorous activity
for a period of three weeks.


451
00:32:46.266 --> 00:32:47.595
And the result...

452
00:32:55.932 --> 00:33:00.262
And the result is
a beautifully contoured breast...


453
00:33:00.798 --> 00:33:04.785
with softness comparable
to that of the young adult.


454
00:33:06.764 --> 00:33:10.992
The psychological well-being
of women who feel crippled...


455
00:33:11.064 --> 00:33:13.724
by their own perceived shortcomings...

456
00:33:14.231 --> 00:33:17.855
can be cured with one simple operation.

457
00:33:56.294 --> 00:33:58.350
Are the phones working?

458
00:34:26.193 --> 00:34:28.819
You wanna see what I've been working on?
I have an idea.


459
00:34:30.126 --> 00:34:31.353
An idea?

460
00:34:32.392 --> 00:34:33.653
Idea.

461
00:34:34.589 --> 00:34:36.181
I got an idea of my own.

462
00:34:37.457 --> 00:34:38.821
Let's...

463
00:34:39.825 --> 00:34:41.485
I know, I got it.

464
00:34:41.826 --> 00:34:45.314
Let's take all my money
and open up a clinic...


465
00:34:45.392 --> 00:34:49.185
that no one will go to
for an operation they don't want.


466
00:34:50.455 --> 00:34:52.480
Let's explore.

467
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:55.755
Let's experience like the kids are doing.

468
00:34:55.824 --> 00:34:59.154
Let's really get into humiliation and failure.

469
00:34:59.324 --> 00:35:00.847
Out of sight!

470
00:35:02.321 --> 00:35:05.981
Let's suck my blood
until I'm dead in the gutter.


471
00:35:07.055 --> 00:35:08.954
I'm sorry.

472
00:35:09.721 --> 00:35:11.586
That was your idea.

473
00:35:12.757 --> 00:35:15.152
We could advertise in the newspaper.

474
00:35:15.254 --> 00:35:17.117
Newspaper?

475
00:35:18.522 --> 00:35:20.750
Look, this is the
ad I've been working on.

476
00:35:20.823 --> 00:35:23.914
You're gonna advertise
my ruined career and reputation?


477
00:35:24.089 --> 00:35:26.453
That's very interesting, but...

478
00:35:27.885 --> 00:35:31.479
you know, doctors never advertise.

479
00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:36.077
- That's because they haven't had to.
- Shut up! Just leave me alone!


480
00:35:36.521 --> 00:35:39.043
In fact, stay out of my sight.

481
00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:56.044
Oh, my goodness.

482
00:35:57.386 --> 00:35:58.477
What?

483
00:36:00.485 --> 00:36:02.974
Not only am I married to a man...

484
00:36:03.052 --> 00:36:06.486
who stuffs women's breasts for a living...

485
00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:10.047
now everybody at the Club's
gonna know about it!


486
00:36:19.686 --> 00:36:20.706
Hey, you!

487
00:36:21.916 --> 00:36:25.680
Don't you say one thing to me!
Don't you say one word!


488
00:36:28.884 --> 00:36:30.407
It's all an act, isn't it?

489
00:36:30.852 --> 00:36:33.578
I thought you were a moron,
but you aren't, are you?


490
00:36:33.718 --> 00:36:36.079
No, you're smart. 
You're very smart!

491
00:36:36.183 --> 00:36:38.912
How else could you ruin my life
with such precision?


492
00:36:38.984 --> 00:36:41.541
- You saw the...
- Shut up! Not one word.


493
00:36:41.617 --> 00:36:43.411
You don't speak!

494
00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:46.907
What did I ever do to you?

495
00:36:49.849 --> 00:36:52.146
Know what?
I want your things out of my office.


496
00:36:53.715 --> 00:36:55.840
I'm just gonna get you started here.

497
00:36:56.082 --> 00:36:58.708
Okay, I just need
you to fill this out.

498
00:37:02.347 --> 00:37:03.746
Good morning, Doctors.

499
00:37:14.347 --> 00:37:15.402
Yeah.

500
00:37:36.314 --> 00:37:39.802
- Good morning, Dr. Larson.
- Good morning, Dr. Saunders.


501
00:37:48.445 --> 00:37:50.638
I want you to understand all your options.

502
00:37:50.746 --> 00:37:53.572
You can go in through the crease
under the breast...


503
00:37:53.643 --> 00:37:54.667
through the nipple...

504
00:37:54.744 --> 00:37:55.937
or through the underarm.

505
00:37:56.011 --> 00:37:59.308
You can go over the muscle
or behind the muscle.


506
00:37:59.379 --> 00:38:01.775
We can accentuate cleavage or volume.

507
00:38:01.877 --> 00:38:04.571
We can give you
the classic teardrop shape.


508
00:38:04.745 --> 00:38:07.038
a fuller melon-shaped breast.

509
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:09.133
Different patients react differently to pain.

510
00:38:09.209 --> 00:38:10.766
We can make the nipples point up.

511
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:13.069
There might be bruising or swelling.

512
00:38:13.176 --> 00:38:16.736
And there's no real maintenance.
It's not like changing a tire.


513
00:38:16.812 --> 00:38:19.278
You don't have to rotate them
every 10,000 miles.


514
00:38:19.378 --> 00:38:23.308
For most women, it's something you can
do on Monday and be working Wednesday.


515
00:38:23.376 --> 00:38:27.899
Although you will have to massage them
frequently at first, preferably at home.


516
00:38:27.975 --> 00:38:30.441
When you're 80,
your breasts will still look 18.


517
00:38:30.577 --> 00:38:32.735
That's left to right
and then top to bottom.

518
00:38:32.876 --> 00:38:36.499
Occasionally, they can harden up a little.
If that happens...


519
00:38:36.674 --> 00:38:40.335
you come back to us
and we'll soften them up for you.


520
00:38:42.276 --> 00:38:43.742
Feel better?

521
00:38:44.178 --> 00:38:47.504
- We can go through the nipple.
- You'll be popular at the nursing home.


522
00:38:47.574 --> 00:38:49.835
- The nipple or the underarm.
- Absolutely safe.


523
00:38:50.476 --> 00:38:54.168
Only danger is, God forbid,
you get stabbed in the chest.


524
00:38:55.575 --> 00:38:57.938
We can make the nipples point up.

525
00:38:58.175 --> 00:39:00.331
It's absolutely safe.

526
00:39:00.706 --> 00:39:02.103
Any questions?

527
00:39:02.339 --> 00:39:04.135
When can I schedule?

528
00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.770
Would it be too soon
to do it on Monday, dear?


529
00:39:37.405 --> 00:39:39.595
Hey! How you doing?

530
00:39:40.204 --> 00:39:42.226
What you got for me today?

531
00:39:43.436 --> 00:39:45.404
More of them big old bags?

532
00:39:46.504 --> 00:39:50.028
I swear, it's just like Christmas
every single time you come.


533
00:39:50.805 --> 00:39:54.236
- Okay, here we go, almost there.
- Wait.


534
00:39:58.737 --> 00:40:00.169
- Okay.
- Okay?


535
00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:01.859
Here we go.

536
00:40:16.869 --> 00:40:18.767
They're beautiful.

537
00:40:20.699 --> 00:40:23.724
You're gonna push, push in...

538
00:40:24.469 --> 00:40:26.263
and lift up, okay?

539
00:40:26.935 --> 00:40:31.197
Then you want to massage them gently
clockwise, like this.


540
00:40:31.269 --> 00:40:34.198
And counterclockwise, like this.

541
00:40:37.534 --> 00:40:41.467
Every day, several times a day, okay?

542
00:40:48.565 --> 00:40:49.792
Any questions?

543
00:40:51.099 --> 00:40:53.430
Yeah. Show me again.

544
00:40:57.234 --> 00:40:58.824
It's too much muscle!

545
00:41:00.498 --> 00:41:03.726
Sorry I'm late.
I had to stop off at the bank.


546
00:41:06.466 --> 00:41:08.296
I got you a little surprise.

547
00:41:09.198 --> 00:41:12.993
- What's this?
- It's your royalty check for this month.


548
00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:17.264
Oh, my God.

549
00:41:19.533 --> 00:41:22.088
Do you know how much
I'm gonna owe in taxes on this?


550
00:41:22.164 --> 00:41:24.188
Yeah, those taxes.

551
00:41:28.096 --> 00:41:30.221
They're killing me!

552
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:34.061
I understand. If someone cancels,
I can schedule you.


553
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.392
But that's the best I can do.

554
00:41:36.564 --> 00:41:39.357
How much can I pay you
to cancel someone?


555
00:41:40.896 --> 00:41:44.021
Ma'am, the doctors
are really busy right now.


556
00:41:44.096 --> 00:41:46.653
I'd like to help you
if I could, but I can't.

557
00:41:52.495 --> 00:41:54.891
- Hello, Laura.
- Hi, Kevin.


558
00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:03.723
It looks like you're doing well.

559
00:42:03.863 --> 00:42:05.295
Been busy.

560
00:42:08.193 --> 00:42:10.922
My sister Katy is really happy
with her results.


561
00:42:11.027 --> 00:42:11.891
Good.

562
00:42:12.095 --> 00:42:15.390
Makes me regret I didn't take you up
on your offer at Baylor...


563
00:42:15.461 --> 00:42:18.257
when I could've gotten them for free.

564
00:42:21.892 --> 00:42:22.882
How's Steve?

565
00:42:23.526 --> 00:42:26.120
We got divorced about three months ago.

566
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.792
I'm sorry.

567
00:42:27.927 --> 00:42:30.723
He's not such a
nice guy, it turns out.

568
00:42:33.159 --> 00:42:34.419
You look good.

569
00:42:35.626 --> 00:42:36.819
Thanks.

570
00:42:37.126 --> 00:42:39.285
But I want to look better.

571
00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:44.124
I was thinking that...

572
00:42:44.226 --> 00:42:48.655
maybe you could give me
something like you gave Katy.


573
00:42:49.224 --> 00:42:53.316
I mean, I'm a little more skinny on top
and she's more...


574
00:42:54.893 --> 00:42:55.949
Yeah.

575
00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:00.345
You're probably totally used to this, right?

576
00:43:00.523 --> 00:43:03.218
I should just show you.

577
00:43:04.092 --> 00:43:05.250
Okay.

578
00:43:08.691 --> 00:43:11.022
It's good to see you again.

579
00:43:19.258 --> 00:43:22.587
- What do you think?
- I think they're super.


580
00:43:23.257 --> 00:43:24.655
Thanks!

581
00:43:24.924 --> 00:43:26.615
I think we could go bigger.

582
00:43:27.255 --> 00:43:28.414
How big?

583
00:43:29.422 --> 00:43:31.446
They're not too small?

584
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:34.846
You don't think we should go with...

585
00:43:36.089 --> 00:43:38.576
350cc, maybe?

586
00:43:38.653 --> 00:43:40.643
They're perfect.

587
00:43:41.587 --> 00:43:45.021
They should be.
He spent four hours working on them.


588
00:43:46.622 --> 00:43:49.884
- Do you want me to close?
- No, I'll do it.


589
00:43:51.322 --> 00:43:54.580
I don't want even
a hint of a scar.

590
00:44:02.154 --> 00:44:04.384
Come on, get a picture of this.

591
00:44:21.684 --> 00:44:22.979
I mean...

592
00:44:23.285 --> 00:44:26.184
will a guy be able
to tell that I have...

593
00:44:26.253 --> 00:44:27.220
you know...

594
00:44:30.053 --> 00:44:32.311
Can you come here for a sec?

595
00:44:35.252 --> 00:44:38.084
- Would you mind?
- No.


596
00:44:54.484 --> 00:44:55.949
Go ahead, touch them.

597
00:44:56.551 --> 00:44:57.812
Go ahead.

598
00:45:03.914 --> 00:45:06.348
Those are... They're perfect.

599
00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:10.612
I wouldn't do anything to you
that I wouldn't do to my wife.


600
00:45:11.084 --> 00:45:12.569
Within reason.

601
00:45:14.281 --> 00:45:17.840
I won't say it didn't hurt,
it felt like a ton of bricks fell on my chest.


602
00:45:17.916 --> 00:45:21.371
But the first time I saw
my two new best friends, I was like:


603
00:45:21.451 --> 00:45:23.938
"Oh, my God, it was worth it!"

604
00:45:24.017 --> 00:45:26.707
My shoulders fit me now. 
I have a waist.

605
00:45:26.781 --> 00:45:29.145
I've been reborn, I rock!

606
00:45:29.213 --> 00:45:31.545
This is the way
I was always meant to look.


607
00:45:31.616 --> 00:45:33.240
This is about artistry.

608
00:45:33.314 --> 00:45:37.111
This is not some ham-fisted,
cut-and-stuff procedure.


609
00:45:37.549 --> 00:45:42.002
If you approach it like it is, you'll end up
with some extremely unhappy women...


610
00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:46.035
with displeasing, wandering or...

611
00:45:46.613 --> 00:45:48.079
walleyed breasts.

612
00:45:48.148 --> 00:45:51.805
They'll be angry at you
and you'll be out of business quickly.


613
00:45:51.911 --> 00:45:55.140
This surgeon really
completely messed this one up.


614
00:45:55.512 --> 00:45:59.071
We call this one the Marty Feldman.

615
00:46:00.046 --> 00:46:01.943
This guy really messed this one up.

616
00:46:03.713 --> 00:46:06.336
If you perform the operation properly...

617
00:46:07.176 --> 00:46:11.406
you'll receive letters from women
thanking you for saving their lives.


618
00:46:11.845 --> 00:46:14.004
In fact, I got...

619
00:46:17.643 --> 00:46:22.599
I didn't bring them with me. Kevin,
would you run and get some of the letters?


620
00:46:25.079 --> 00:46:27.874
Why don't you get them? 
I'll take over.

621
00:46:29.378 --> 00:46:32.206
That's all right. The letters,
could you go get them, please?


622
00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:37.268
I can handle the rest of the questions
while you get them.


623
00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:43.908
Laura was going through the books
last night.


624
00:46:43.978 --> 00:46:47.498
Really? Is Laura our accountant now?

625
00:46:48.343 --> 00:46:52.537
It looks like you received a Dow Corning
royalty payment last month.


626
00:46:54.142 --> 00:46:55.132
Really?

627
00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:58.137
I don't remember receiving
my share of that.


628
00:46:59.041 --> 00:47:01.097
I need more suction here.

629
00:47:02.273 --> 00:47:04.207
If the truth be known...

630
00:47:05.042 --> 00:47:07.031
it's because I'm stealing from you.

631
00:47:07.308 --> 00:47:09.366
I'm robbing you for the fun of it.

632
00:47:09.941 --> 00:47:13.597
- I wasn't accusing you of stealing.
- The hell you weren't.


633
00:47:13.838 --> 00:47:15.100
The hell.

634
00:47:15.173 --> 00:47:17.604
Could I get some suction here?

635
00:47:18.008 --> 00:47:20.439
I'm bringing you your sutures.

636
00:47:21.242 --> 00:47:22.231
"Please."

637
00:47:22.942 --> 00:47:25.495
"Can I get some suction here, please?"

638
00:47:25.838 --> 00:47:28.304
Let's try to treat my wife with respect.

639
00:47:28.372 --> 00:47:32.306
In here, she is my employee,
she is not your wife.


640
00:47:33.207 --> 00:47:34.867
Is that a problem?

641
00:47:35.243 --> 00:47:38.727
Because if that's a problem,
I'll get a new employee.


642
00:47:43.605 --> 00:47:47.470
Let me get this right.
They won't explode when you're flying.


643
00:47:47.839 --> 00:47:50.530
They didn't when I flew up here
from Texas.


644
00:47:50.604 --> 00:47:53.400
Bert, there are many augmented
flight attendants...


645
00:47:53.471 --> 00:47:56.869
and I don't believe I've ever heard
of any problems.


646
00:47:57.138 --> 00:48:01.401
- They do help me swim a lot better.
- All right.


647
00:48:01.671 --> 00:48:05.795
Tell us, what kind of woman
has her breasts augmented?


648
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:08.927
- There are so many...
- The typical woman who comes to see us...


649
00:48:09.003 --> 00:48:10.764
Excuse me, can I finish?

650
00:48:10.836 --> 00:48:14.565
She has a husband who isn't maturing
as quickly as she is.


651
00:48:15.237 --> 00:48:19.134
The girls flock around him,
he looks good on the golf course.


652
00:48:19.535 --> 00:48:22.695
Meanwhile, she's borne all the children,
her breasts are sagging...


653
00:48:22.769 --> 00:48:25.703
and she wants the operation
so she can feel good again.


654
00:48:25.771 --> 00:48:29.829
In one respect, it isn't important
what he thinks you look like.


655
00:48:30.268 --> 00:48:34.324
What's important is what you think
he thinks you look like.


656
00:48:34.468 --> 00:48:37.457
- That's exactly right.
- Very well put.


657
00:48:37.602 --> 00:48:41.434
Actually, you're like psychiatrists
with knives!


658
00:48:41.604 --> 00:48:43.263
- In a way, yes.
- No, I...


659
00:48:43.336 --> 00:48:45.426
We get lots of referrals from psychiatrists.

660
00:48:45.502 --> 00:48:49.024
They know how important it is
for a woman to be able to...


661
00:48:49.167 --> 00:48:52.101
buy a bathing suit
without getting depressed.


662
00:48:52.202 --> 00:48:56.600
Or walk into a room in a strapless dress,
knowing heads will turn.


663
00:48:56.899 --> 00:48:59.662
That's why we've come up with
this natural-feel implant.


664
00:48:59.734 --> 00:49:02.790
What? What we came up with?

665
00:49:02.999 --> 00:49:04.989
I don't remember you coming up
with anything.


666
00:49:05.367 --> 00:49:09.095
- Do you want to go somewhere and confer?
- Honey, let's not get into this.


667
00:49:09.168 --> 00:49:13.495
Let's get right into it. What exactly,
specifically, did you come up with?


668
00:49:13.899 --> 00:49:16.729
- I don't think this is the time or place.
- What?


669
00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:19.695
By "come up with," you mean what?
"To steal"?


670
00:49:19.932 --> 00:49:23.093
By "come up with" meaning
"to take undeserved credit"?


671
00:49:23.167 --> 00:49:27.119
- You know better than that.
- What do you mean by "come up with"?


672
00:49:27.264 --> 00:49:29.753
I provided you with the knowledge.

673
00:49:30.331 --> 00:49:33.458
Provided you with the knowledge,
the finances...


674
00:49:33.533 --> 00:49:36.022
the surgical expertise, the credibility.

675
00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.253
Credibility? Fuck!

676
00:49:39.231 --> 00:49:41.254
What would you have done?

677
00:49:41.598 --> 00:49:44.861
A 25-year-old resident who nearly got
kicked out of medical school.


678
00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:47.761
Who never once performed a surgery.

679
00:49:47.832 --> 00:49:51.262
- Isn't that a bit self-delusional?
- I would've done fine without you.


680
00:49:51.496 --> 00:49:54.190
- You would've done nothing.
- I would've done fine.


681
00:49:54.263 --> 00:49:59.128
Then, my friend, why don't you try it?
Why don't you try doing fine without me?


682
00:50:00.197 --> 00:50:02.924
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

683
00:50:07.562 --> 00:50:09.459
Come on.

684
00:50:11.162 --> 00:50:12.823
How do I get this thing off?

685
00:50:12.897 --> 00:50:15.885
Someone help her with her equipment.
Dear, you're welcome to...


686
00:50:15.963 --> 00:50:18.223
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


687
00:50:18.894 --> 00:50:21.690
So much for the magic of live television.

688
00:50:21.762 --> 00:50:26.092
We're still here with the remaining
inventor of the silicone implant.


689
00:50:26.161 --> 00:50:27.957
I don't think so.

690
00:50:28.995 --> 00:50:32.754
Excuse me, I'm sorry. Little twerp.

691
00:50:34.659 --> 00:50:36.887
I work at a chocolate factory.

692
00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:40.085
That's very interesting.
We may explore that a little more.


693
00:50:40.528 --> 00:50:45.015
I said, "He's insane!" That's right,
he's lost his grasp on... Come on!


694
00:50:46.092 --> 00:50:50.116
He's lost his grasp on reality. Hello?
He's berserk!


695
00:50:50.326 --> 00:50:53.761
It was difficult but I had to let him go,
he didn't leave.


696
00:50:53.828 --> 00:50:56.916
Because our patients
deserve the best results.


697
00:50:56.991 --> 00:50:58.854
Some of his work was...

698
00:50:59.525 --> 00:51:03.014
I felt that I
could not stand behind him.

699
00:51:03.526 --> 00:51:08.357
When I came up with the implant idea,
he had trouble even saying "breast."


700
00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:09.846
Thank you.

701
00:51:09.924 --> 00:51:11.515
He would proposition women...

702
00:51:11.991 --> 00:51:13.718
while they were still on the table.

703
00:51:13.892 --> 00:51:16.322
You want toilet plunger breasts?
He's the man!


704
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:20.791
You want numb nipples?
You want nipples that won't get erect?


705
00:51:20.991 --> 00:51:23.979
Call me old-fashioned,
call me anything you want to.


706
00:51:24.124 --> 00:51:27.647
Wrecked, ugly, wrecked nipples!

707
00:51:27.823 --> 00:51:29.948
Every patient was a potential date for him.

708
00:51:30.056 --> 00:51:31.784
What? Did he tell you that?

709
00:51:31.991 --> 00:51:34.252
Of course I can't reveal names.

710
00:51:34.424 --> 00:51:38.048
Hold on. Can I ask you something?
Did you sleep with my patients?


711
00:51:38.123 --> 00:51:40.713
Did you sleep with my patients?

712
00:51:41.856 --> 00:51:44.084
You didn't? Can you prove it?

713
00:51:44.622 --> 00:51:46.056
Can you prove it?

714
00:51:46.225 --> 00:51:49.880
No you can't, can you?
You can't prove a negative, can you?


715
00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:51.884
Isn't that some, 
Jesus Christ...

716
00:51:51.955 --> 00:51:55.183
some journalistic axiom or something?

717
00:51:55.255 --> 00:51:57.916
You're an investigative reporter,
aren't you?


718
00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:01.285
Why don't you do some investigating?

719
00:52:04.453 --> 00:52:07.352
- Is Mrs. Hummings here?
- No.


720
00:52:13.956 --> 00:52:16.283
Did she not show up?

721
00:52:17.954 --> 00:52:19.011
No.

722
00:52:22.019 --> 00:52:23.917
What the fuck?

723
00:52:24.553 --> 00:52:27.043
Is that the third no-show this week?

724
00:52:29.152 --> 00:52:32.676
That son of a bitch.
I knew he'd do something like this.


725
00:52:33.686 --> 00:52:36.674
- Who are you talking about, sweet pea?
- Larson, goddamn it.


726
00:52:36.752 --> 00:52:39.584
That son of a bitch,
he's clogged our appointment book...


727
00:52:39.653 --> 00:52:42.052
with these phony appointments.

728
00:52:42.121 --> 00:52:44.346
But, honey, we have plenty of open slots.

729
00:52:44.418 --> 00:52:48.248
This is what I want you to do:
Call his office, start booking appointments.


730
00:52:48.317 --> 00:52:49.409
Use a fake name.

731
00:52:49.484 --> 00:52:54.078
Book a breast augmentation and a nose job
every half hour, a skin graft, okay?


732
00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:58.147
You're talking like a crazy person
and I am now ignoring you.


733
00:52:58.450 --> 00:53:00.279
- Pick up the phone.
- No.


734
00:53:01.017 --> 00:53:03.610
- Pick up the phone!
- No!


735
00:53:04.018 --> 00:53:05.985
We have had six patients this week.

736
00:53:06.086 --> 00:53:10.447
We can't make any prank phone calls,
because we can't pay our phone bill.


737
00:53:11.682 --> 00:53:16.082
Did you call Health and Fitness Magazine
about buying an ad? Did you?


738
00:53:16.184 --> 00:53:17.444
No, I did not.

739
00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:18.776
Pick up the phone.

740
00:53:21.119 --> 00:53:23.049
We can't run any ads...

741
00:53:23.116 --> 00:53:27.605
because we are totally and completely
out of money.


742
00:53:32.183 --> 00:53:33.978
What are you saying?

743
00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:36.246
I am so frustrated.

744
00:53:40.681 --> 00:53:42.613
We don't have any money.

745
00:53:43.514 --> 00:53:45.345
The fact is, Dr. Saunders...

746
00:53:45.415 --> 00:53:49.470
you were an employee of Dr. Larson's
when you aided in the conception of this...


747
00:53:49.546 --> 00:53:53.376
"Aided in the conception?"
We were partners. I invented it.


748
00:53:53.445 --> 00:53:57.572
All royalties from Dow Corning
are controlled directly by him.


749
00:53:58.148 --> 00:54:02.406
Admit it, between you and me,
man to man, no one else around...


750
00:54:02.512 --> 00:54:05.206
just tell me it's bullshit, isn't it?

751
00:54:05.279 --> 00:54:07.211
It's wrong. It's bullshit.

752
00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:12.678
His previous generosity towards you
in no way obligates him...


753
00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:15.575
This is unbelievable.
You're going straight to hell.


754
00:54:15.644 --> 00:54:18.474
You son of a
bitch, you're going to hell.

755
00:54:18.978 --> 00:54:20.604
Talk to Dow.

756
00:54:23.047 --> 00:54:24.943
- Can't get into your car?
- Watch it.


757
00:54:25.011 --> 00:54:26.104
Sue me, prick.

758
00:54:31.211 --> 00:54:34.110
I talked to our legal department
before I came down here.


759
00:54:34.511 --> 00:54:38.443
There's nothing we can do to alter
the original royalty agreement.


760
00:54:38.511 --> 00:54:43.465
What I can do is negotiate more
favorable terms on the price of implants...


761
00:54:43.543 --> 00:54:45.372
if you order in bulk.

762
00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:49.400
You don't understand something.
I don't need cheaper implants.


763
00:54:49.476 --> 00:54:51.569
I need women to put them into!

764
00:54:52.644 --> 00:54:54.405
You can go, grandma!

765
00:54:56.042 --> 00:54:57.439
What the hell?

766
00:54:57.508 --> 00:55:01.373
What I need is a good bankruptcy lawyer
and a gun.


767
00:55:01.442 --> 00:55:04.898
A gun with a bullet
to put through my fucking head.


768
00:55:04.976 --> 00:55:07.842
You need to calm down and relax.

769
00:55:08.011 --> 00:55:09.438
Turn here.

770
00:55:19.642 --> 00:55:21.370
What is this place?

771
00:55:21.806 --> 00:55:24.739
A testament to all the good you've done.

772
00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:36.671
Hey, Gerald! Wonderful to see you again.

773
00:55:36.741 --> 00:55:40.070
- It's been a long time. How's it going?
- Great seeing you.


774
00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:44.630
I'd like to introduce you to Dr. Saunders,
the plastic surgeon I was telling you about.


775
00:55:44.707 --> 00:55:48.365
Wonderful to meet you. I'm Andy Rinough.
Welcome to Remy's.


776
00:55:48.439 --> 00:55:49.768
Thanks.

777
00:55:51.574 --> 00:55:53.435
Would you like to join me upstairs?

778
00:55:53.505 --> 00:55:56.994
- I'd like to go upstairs. Would you?
- What's upstairs?


779
00:55:57.739 --> 00:55:59.070
Come on.

780
00:56:09.472 --> 00:56:12.463
We got ourselves a new baby girl.

781
00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:15.869
Gentlemen, put your hands together.

782
00:56:46.303 --> 00:56:48.325
Sit right over here.

783
00:56:51.535 --> 00:56:53.024
How you doing?

784
00:57:03.001 --> 00:57:04.967
This is unbelievable.

785
00:57:05.402 --> 00:57:06.733
Here we go.

786
00:57:10.232 --> 00:57:12.698
I'm a big fan of your work.

787
00:57:17.335 --> 00:57:19.665
- Dr. Saunders?
- Yes?


788
00:57:20.037 --> 00:57:21.896
Hi! Don't you remember me?

789
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.931
I'm Savannah. I used to be Jessica.

790
00:57:27.335 --> 00:57:28.391
Yes.

791
00:57:29.834 --> 00:57:32.061
Dr. Saunders, you gave me these.

792
00:57:33.301 --> 00:57:34.991
I just love them.

793
00:57:36.098 --> 00:57:37.894
They're great.

794
00:57:44.433 --> 00:57:46.059
I love this song.

795
00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:48.262
It's funky.

796
00:57:48.598 --> 00:57:52.587
- Can I dance for you?
- No, thank you. Thanks very much.


797
00:58:45.861 --> 00:58:49.520
Breasts: They have this powerful duality...

798
00:58:49.594 --> 00:58:53.426
as both signage
designed to attract the opposite sex...


799
00:58:53.564 --> 00:58:57.356
and then as a food source
to nurture the offspring of the alliance.


800
00:58:57.594 --> 00:59:02.083
They also give off special energy
because they're circles within circles.


801
00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:05.249
I hate to put a label on myself,
but I am a feminist.


802
00:59:05.327 --> 00:59:09.281
I got the surgery, not in spite of,
but because of that fact.


803
00:59:09.461 --> 00:59:12.289
I think obtaining
a culturally rewarded appearance...


804
00:59:12.357 --> 00:59:17.225
as politically incorrect as that sounds,
is a liberating experience.


805
00:59:19.627 --> 00:59:21.113
Hi, Vanessa.

806
00:59:21.825 --> 00:59:23.916
You can't smoke in here.

807
00:59:25.225 --> 00:59:26.623
I'm sorry.

808
00:59:27.559 --> 00:59:29.286
I'm very unhappy.

809
00:59:29.358 --> 00:59:32.884
What's wrong?
Is everything okay with the augmentation?


810
00:59:33.359 --> 00:59:35.084
They're disgusting.

811
00:59:35.458 --> 00:59:36.481
What do you mean?

812
00:59:37.023 --> 00:59:39.820
They're disgusting and flat, not big enough.

813
00:59:39.891 --> 00:59:42.881
I feel like a boy. 
I want them bigger.

814
00:59:48.723 --> 00:59:50.519
Your breasts are perfect.

815
00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:53.379
They're great.

816
00:59:53.524 --> 00:59:54.854
You've had...

817
00:59:55.423 --> 01:00:00.119
what would be considered a very large
augmentation eight months ago.


818
01:00:00.456 --> 01:00:04.548
It's not good enough anymore.
It was at first and now it isn't.


819
01:00:04.955 --> 01:00:08.352
In the before-and-after picture,
you're already in the "after."


820
01:00:08.421 --> 01:00:09.614
Do you understand?

821
01:00:09.988 --> 01:00:11.615
You can make them bigger.

822
01:00:11.757 --> 01:00:15.744
- I'm sorry, I can't do that.
- Bullshit!


823
01:00:15.888 --> 01:00:19.149
You can. You put more stuff in them
and they'll get bigger.


824
01:00:19.321 --> 01:00:22.379
What I'm saying is,
I've never performed an operation...


825
01:00:22.455 --> 01:00:26.356
that I didn't feel
would be cosmetically beneficial.


826
01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.411
What you're asking for,
it wouldn't make you look...


827
01:00:30.486 --> 01:00:32.976
You have to stop smoking.

828
01:00:33.288 --> 01:00:34.810
I want them to be big.

829
01:00:34.987 --> 01:00:37.283
Really big. That's what I want.

830
01:00:43.254 --> 01:00:46.549
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right, sweetie. Okay.


831
01:00:47.154 --> 01:00:48.916
This woman is huge!

832
01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:54.478
She wants to be bigger, all right?

833
01:00:55.919 --> 01:00:58.750
I think she's big enough.

834
01:01:01.187 --> 01:01:02.413
Scalpel?

835
01:01:06.087 --> 01:01:07.074
No.

836
01:01:08.349 --> 01:01:10.009
Come on.

837
01:01:10.218 --> 01:01:11.411
Scalpel?

838
01:01:12.951 --> 01:01:14.281
Thank you.

839
01:01:27.484 --> 01:01:31.813
They tell me I drive too fast.
I already got five speeding tickets.


840
01:01:33.716 --> 01:01:35.476
Know what I'm saying?

841
01:01:37.215 --> 01:01:38.910
I'll be back.

842
01:01:44.617 --> 01:01:46.139
Don't even start.

843
01:01:46.216 --> 01:01:49.671
For God's sake!
She's not going to be able to buy clothes.


844
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:52.944
It's what the woman wants
and we need the money.


845
01:01:53.217 --> 01:01:57.171
- What kind of job is she going to have?
- It's none of our business.


846
01:01:57.248 --> 01:01:59.940
Don't ever walk out of surgery again.

847
01:02:04.348 --> 01:02:05.405
Look at that.

848
01:02:05.548 --> 01:02:07.448
- She's incredible.
- She's beautiful.


849
01:02:07.515 --> 01:02:09.105
It's not too big?

850
01:02:09.248 --> 01:02:12.113
She's making $1,000 a week,
they're not too big.


851
01:02:13.946 --> 01:02:15.674
Know what I'm going to do?

852
01:02:16.214 --> 01:02:20.043
I'm gonna get every girl
who wants to have their boobs done...


853
01:02:20.113 --> 01:02:22.307
and I'm gonna have them done by you.

854
01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:26.812
- You'll refer them to me?
- I'll direct them to you. Go on, take a hit.


855
01:02:26.879 --> 01:02:29.276
- No, I've had enough.
- Come on, be a man.


856
01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:34.344
I'm gonna refer them to you and in return,
you'll pay me some kind of referral fee.


857
01:02:36.813 --> 01:02:40.540
What kind of referral fee
are you talking about?


858
01:02:40.876 --> 01:02:45.071
I don't know. Maybe 10, 15 percent...

859
01:02:45.611 --> 01:02:47.601
10 percent of what you charge.

860
01:02:47.679 --> 01:02:50.874
This is the best promotion
you can ever hope for.


861
01:02:51.446 --> 01:02:52.636
When men see her...

862
01:02:53.177 --> 01:02:56.634
you'll have their wives
in your office the next day.


863
01:03:05.745 --> 01:03:06.901
Marker.

864
01:03:08.076 --> 01:03:10.270
- Guys wanna get their hands on these.
- Jesus!


865
01:03:10.343 --> 01:03:13.969
These women with National Geographic
boobs drooping around their waist...


866
01:03:14.044 --> 01:03:15.873
of course their boyfriends look at me.

867
01:03:16.144 --> 01:03:19.628
I needed my teeth fixed, too,
but I only had enough money for one.


868
01:03:19.708 --> 01:03:23.403
I think I made the right choice.
No one notices my teeth are crooked.


869
01:03:24.142 --> 01:03:25.630
Excuse me, Bill.

870
01:03:29.776 --> 01:03:31.106
Look at that.

871
01:03:31.643 --> 01:03:36.539
Oh, my goodness. Same designers.
You'll have to keep your distance.


872
01:03:36.606 --> 01:03:40.540
Are those my breasts?
They look awfully familiar.


873
01:03:42.408 --> 01:03:46.463
That's a completely different style.
It's teardrop shaped.


874
01:03:49.374 --> 01:03:53.364
I paid couture prices, you better not
have given me ready-to-wear.


875
01:03:54.341 --> 01:03:55.637
My goodness.

876
01:03:59.172 --> 01:04:00.433
Oh, dear.

877
01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.006
Where's the food?
Do you know where the food is?


878
01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:06.097
No, that's liquor, sir.

879
01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:08.934
Excuse me for a moment, won't you?

880
01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:11.730
Are you guys hungry?

881
01:04:11.873 --> 01:04:13.097
Hold on. Hello.

882
01:04:13.171 --> 01:04:16.400
Don't walk away, I'm not done with you.
Thank you.


883
01:04:17.106 --> 01:04:18.834
You can't do that.

884
01:04:21.073 --> 01:04:22.266
Hello, Kevin.

885
01:04:24.507 --> 01:04:26.332
Well, hello, Bill.

886
01:04:27.138 --> 01:04:29.502
I'd like to personally thank you...

887
01:04:29.572 --> 01:04:33.163
for dispelling the notion of ethics
in plastic surgery.


888
01:04:33.371 --> 01:04:38.202
They were actually beginning to take us
seriously and you set us back 10 years.


889
01:04:38.472 --> 01:04:41.437
- I did? How did I do that?
- How?


890
01:04:42.136 --> 01:04:43.397
By this.

891
01:04:43.904 --> 01:04:45.698
By your behavior.

892
01:04:45.937 --> 01:04:49.926
Your whole behavior, your lack of integrity,
your damn persona.


893
01:04:52.302 --> 01:04:53.962
You make them too big.

894
01:04:54.469 --> 01:04:58.266
I give the customers
what they ask for, you jackass.


895
01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:01.402
- Different women want different things.
- Really?


896
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:03.699
To look like circus freaks?

897
01:05:04.172 --> 01:05:05.464
Freaks?

898
01:05:05.967 --> 01:05:10.663
You call them freaks, that's very telling.
I find that very telling about you.


899
01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:15.596
What you're doing is perverse.

900
01:05:17.669 --> 01:05:19.155
Go to hell.

901
01:05:22.802 --> 01:05:25.200
It's always nice to see you.

902
01:05:26.235 --> 01:05:28.927
You should be ashamed of yourself.

903
01:05:29.035 --> 01:05:33.659
Mutilating your body to fulfill
some kind of male pornographic fantasy!


904
01:05:33.766 --> 01:05:37.755
I am not fulfilling anybody's fantasy.
I did this for myself, honey.


905
01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.498
You did it because Playboy tells you...

906
01:05:40.734 --> 01:05:43.223
Don't tell me why I did what I did,
all right?


907
01:05:43.301 --> 01:05:47.458
Phil, I think it's important to realize that...

908
01:05:47.866 --> 01:05:50.593
many intelligent women
find the operation empowering.


909
01:05:50.965 --> 01:05:52.658
Hold on!

910
01:05:53.966 --> 01:05:58.161
I think these women are jealous.
They know that girl... What's her name?


911
01:05:58.234 --> 01:06:00.663
- Cindy.
- They know Cindy looks better than them.


912
01:06:00.732 --> 01:06:04.290
- Please!
- I'd have the operation if I could afford it.


913
01:06:04.366 --> 01:06:06.128
Do you do charity work?

914
01:06:08.066 --> 01:06:10.159
Charity work, Doctor, how about that?

915
01:06:10.532 --> 01:06:13.759
In most tribal societies, this is the ideal.

916
01:06:14.232 --> 01:06:17.026
Sagging breasts are a sign of beauty...

917
01:06:17.098 --> 01:06:19.894
symbolizing pregnancy and childbirth.

918
01:06:19.964 --> 01:06:23.294
Only in our culture is this the ideal:

919
01:06:23.732 --> 01:06:25.695
An upright, adolescent breast.

920
01:06:26.563 --> 01:06:30.792
What this doctor has created
is this Barbie-doll look.


921
01:06:31.064 --> 01:06:33.690
It's a body type
simply not found in nature.

922
01:06:33.864 --> 01:06:39.089
I think it's important to draw a distinction
between reasonable, ethical doctors...


923
01:06:39.227 --> 01:06:42.684
such as myself and Dr. Franklin Rose,
a handful of others.


924
01:06:45.229 --> 01:06:48.320
This woman,
and I'm sure you're a nice woman.


925
01:06:48.462 --> 01:06:50.054
Thank you, Doctor.

926
01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:54.956
She's not one of my patients
and she's not representative of my work.


927
01:06:55.561 --> 01:06:57.891
My doctor is Kevin Saunders.

928
01:06:58.263 --> 01:06:59.692
Hi, Kevin.

929
01:07:00.695 --> 01:07:02.184
I love what you do for me.

930
01:07:05.226 --> 01:07:07.055
How is it? Is it good?

931
01:07:09.261 --> 01:07:11.488
I think I just burst a blood vessel.

932
01:07:16.761 --> 01:07:20.749
Look, you missed some.
You'll have to try it again.


933
01:07:23.226 --> 01:07:25.852
Are you trying to take advantage of me?

934
01:07:25.927 --> 01:07:30.120
You're a very bad girl. You're very bad.
You're wicked.


935
01:08:18.957 --> 01:08:20.786
Hello.

936
01:08:47.056 --> 01:08:48.612
I'm sorry.

937
01:09:12.386 --> 01:09:17.319
I used to work in investment banking
and was totally respected for my mind.


938
01:09:17.387 --> 01:09:21.011
For reasons unrelated to work,
I decided to get the surgery done.


939
01:09:21.086 --> 01:09:22.948
The strangest thing happened:

940
01:09:23.152 --> 01:09:26.586
All the guys I worked with began
treating me like a moronic bimbo.


941
01:09:26.886 --> 01:09:30.342
I've known them for years,
and now they were calling me...


942
01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:33.542
baby and doll face and sweet pants.

943
01:09:34.118 --> 01:09:37.777
It's like in one weekend,
I went from being a respected equal...


944
01:09:37.851 --> 01:09:42.613
to some kind of totally vacuous,
available, helpless, slut secretary.


945
01:09:42.851 --> 01:09:47.248
Like I'd paid the doctor to take out
my brain and stuff it in my tits.


946
01:09:53.918 --> 01:09:55.144
Here we are!

947
01:09:56.316 --> 01:09:58.507
Come on, don't be shy.

948
01:09:59.015 --> 01:10:02.175
He built this house
when he got divorced in '83.


949
01:10:03.216 --> 01:10:05.545
30,000 square feet.

950
01:10:05.617 --> 01:10:07.446
- Hey, Bitsy.
- Hey there!


951
01:10:07.517 --> 01:10:11.913
Marble floors from Italy.
Honduras mahogany railings.


952
01:10:12.714 --> 01:10:15.704
Lots of these Impressionist paintings
from France.


953
01:10:15.783 --> 01:10:18.715
They say he can have me ready
by the August issue.


954
01:10:18.782 --> 01:10:21.375
He's the Penthouse plastic surgeon.

955
01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:25.173
He can take a dump truck
and hammer her into a Ferrari.


956
01:10:25.246 --> 01:10:27.440
That's my favorite car!

957
01:10:27.814 --> 01:10:30.280
Don't be afraid to go too big.

958
01:10:30.348 --> 01:10:34.042
Dr. Saunders can fit in 400cc implants...

959
01:10:34.150 --> 01:10:38.771
when every other surgeon is saying
they can't squeeze in 200cc.


960
01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:42.042
- Hi, hon. How you feeling?
- Good!


961
01:10:43.347 --> 01:10:45.746
- Hey, girls!
- Hi, Judith!


962
01:10:46.481 --> 01:10:48.140
That's Janice.

963
01:10:48.447 --> 01:10:50.637
She's going out with a very famous star...

964
01:10:50.711 --> 01:10:53.701
whose name you would recognize
if I said it.


965
01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:55.110
But I can't.

966
01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:00.109
He's paying to have the implants
her old boyfriend gave her...


967
01:11:00.179 --> 01:11:02.543
replaced with new implants.

968
01:11:04.576 --> 01:11:09.306
Some of the girls like to come here
to rest up after the operation.


969
01:11:09.378 --> 01:11:11.310
- Here you are, Doctor.
- Thanks.


970
01:11:11.378 --> 01:11:13.572
That's Summer. Hey, girl.

971
01:11:14.579 --> 01:11:18.133
She's here to prepare
for her Falcon Crest audition.


972
01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:22.299
This is Ashley.

973
01:11:22.611 --> 01:11:24.509
- Hello, Ashley.
- Hi.


974
01:11:24.577 --> 01:11:26.702
Thank you. How was your flight?

975
01:11:26.811 --> 01:11:28.868
Great. I'm so excited to be here!

976
01:11:29.079 --> 01:11:31.404
We're excited to have you here.

977
01:11:33.076 --> 01:11:35.871
Jennifer, you wanna get Ashley a cocktail?

978
01:11:36.811 --> 01:11:38.640
- Are you hungry?
- No.


979
01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:41.404
It's all right if you are.

980
01:11:48.376 --> 01:11:51.241
- Hello, George. How are you?
- Dr. Larson.


981
01:11:53.243 --> 01:11:56.967
- Aren't you speaking today?
- In about 15 minutes. Join us.


982
01:12:03.975 --> 01:12:07.338
- Dr. William Larson?
- Yes, sir?


983
01:12:07.409 --> 01:12:11.736
I don't know if you remember me or not.
We talked in the '85 convention.


984
01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.603
Jim Kidder.

985
01:12:15.074 --> 01:12:17.302
Honey, come here.
I'm sure you remember.


986
01:12:17.374 --> 01:12:20.273
I am such a fan.
I've always known you're a genius.


987
01:12:20.341 --> 01:12:23.929
This is Dr. Larson.
He invented what you got right there!


988
01:12:24.171 --> 01:12:27.570
You know what? I've got a funny idea.
This is funny.


989
01:12:27.773 --> 01:12:31.604
Don't you think it'd be funny if you...
Could you autograph those?


990
01:12:31.674 --> 01:12:33.469
That would be great.

991
01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:37.332
- A little unusual.
- It'd mean so much.


992
01:12:39.271 --> 01:12:40.396
Bless your heart.

993
01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:49.970
- Could you sign mine, too, please?
- This is getting to be a little silly, now.


994
01:12:50.203 --> 01:12:51.692
Oh, my God.

995
01:12:53.371 --> 01:12:55.099
Sign them, you fucker.

996
01:12:57.905 --> 01:12:58.996
Lady, please.

997
01:12:59.271 --> 01:13:02.796
- This is what you did to me.
- You don't need to do this in here.


998
01:13:03.503 --> 01:13:06.561
It's a little embarrassing.
Please put your sweater down.


999
01:13:06.636 --> 01:13:08.900
You don't have anything to say to me?

1000
01:13:08.972 --> 01:13:13.733
Yes, I do. Put your sweater down
or I'll have security take you out.


1001
01:13:16.735 --> 01:13:18.099
Fuck you.

1002
01:13:18.335 --> 01:13:20.893
- Ma'am, let's go.
- Goddamn you.


1003
01:13:20.969 --> 01:13:23.026
Fuck off! Goddamn you!

1004
01:13:23.269 --> 01:13:25.758
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1005
01:13:29.566 --> 01:13:31.193
That's not right.

1006
01:13:35.567 --> 01:13:37.660
- Sorry, sir.
- Excuse me.


1007
01:13:39.502 --> 01:13:41.470
We can make you look something...

1008
01:13:41.803 --> 01:13:43.628
like this.

1009
01:13:46.166 --> 01:13:48.293
- No?
- Not really.


1010
01:13:48.368 --> 01:13:52.494
It's nice,
but if you really want to stop the trains...


1011
01:13:54.568 --> 01:13:56.827
we can do something like that.

1012
01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.966
Then, we would take your nipple...

1013
01:14:02.967 --> 01:14:04.831
move it up to here.

1014
01:14:07.034 --> 01:14:09.160
It's hard to believe, right?

1015
01:14:09.464 --> 01:14:11.761
She had an augmentation in '87.

1016
01:14:12.032 --> 01:14:14.864
I think if she'd gone bigger...

1017
01:14:14.933 --> 01:14:17.897
her career would be
in better shape today.


1018
01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:24.430
Half of Hollywood is wearing my breasts.

1019
01:14:24.531 --> 01:14:28.930
It's true: Pamela Anderson,
Dolly Parton, Cher.


1020
01:14:29.931 --> 01:14:35.522
In fact, Victoria's real secret is that
everyone in that catalog are my patients.


1021
01:14:35.732 --> 01:14:39.093
This is all off the record, of course.

1022
01:14:40.062 --> 01:14:44.395
They're fantasy in the flesh.
The perfect female form.


1023
01:14:44.464 --> 01:14:45.555
That's me!

1024
01:14:45.631 --> 01:14:49.187
Here's the man responsible
for this veritable Garden of Eden.


1025
01:14:49.295 --> 01:14:50.783
Meet Dr. Kevin Saunders.

1026
01:14:50.862 --> 01:14:54.761
I think if she'd gone bigger,
her career would be in better shape today.


1027
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:57.792
One of the inventors
of the silicone breast implant...


1028
01:14:57.864 --> 01:15:00.353
and one of the country's
most prolific breast men...


1029
01:15:00.431 --> 01:15:03.258
Dr. Saunders doesn't hesitate
to brag about his work.


1030
01:15:03.328 --> 01:15:05.192
Victoria's real secret...

1031
01:15:05.396 --> 01:15:07.862
is all the women in the catalog
are my patients.


1032
01:15:08.262 --> 01:15:12.696
It's true, day after day,
I work with women's breasts.


1033
01:15:12.896 --> 01:15:16.087
It's a terrible job,
but someone's got to do it.


1034
01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.786
While Dr. Saunders is laughing...

1035
01:15:18.861 --> 01:15:23.816
thousands of women are suffering
from silicone-induced autoimmune disease.


1036
01:15:23.927 --> 01:15:27.917
Health eroded, hopes destroyed,
Jane went back into the operating room.


1037
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:30.658
This is what came out of her body.

1038
01:15:32.093 --> 01:15:33.615
I had...

1039
01:15:34.826 --> 01:15:39.090
leakage from my right breast
of a clear liquid.


1040
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:40.750
Leakage from the nipple...

1041
01:15:40.827 --> 01:15:44.654
fever, pneumonia, chest pains.
I knew there was something very wrong.


1042
01:15:44.724 --> 01:15:48.953
Karen was diagnosed with a disease
of the immune system called lupus.


1043
01:15:49.026 --> 01:15:52.824
I was absolutely shocked
to find out it was silicone.


1044
01:15:52.927 --> 01:15:54.893
It was leaking from me for two years.

1045
01:15:55.028 --> 01:15:58.855
Had I known these things could rupture,
I never would've had this done.


1046
01:15:58.924 --> 01:16:01.516
I thought they would last a lifetime.

1047
01:16:03.293 --> 01:16:05.418
What are you left with now?

1048
01:16:07.925 --> 01:16:12.822
Where's my fucking phone?
Get me my cellular! Goddamn it.


1049
01:16:19.559 --> 01:16:22.317
tell people about
what's happened to me, but...


1050
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:24.789
You're not going to die.

1051
01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:29.914
I know you're scared,
but it was just a TV show.


1052
01:16:31.290 --> 01:16:33.949
Do you believe everything you see on TV?

1053
01:16:34.557 --> 01:16:37.180
I'm sorry. Could you hold on, please?

1054
01:16:37.355 --> 01:16:41.651
You have 36 cancellations this week
and two death threats, one sounds serious.


1055
01:16:41.723 --> 01:16:44.518
The Times, Tribune,
Post, and Sun want to speak with you.


1056
01:16:44.723 --> 01:16:49.415
Channels 2, 4, 5 and 11
all want you on the news tonight.


1057
01:16:51.553 --> 01:16:53.951
They found three women
out of three million...


1058
01:16:54.454 --> 01:16:56.148
and they put them on TV.

1059
01:16:56.422 --> 01:16:58.718
That's what you call reasonable journalism.

1060
01:16:58.789 --> 01:17:01.018
Hush up, we got a surprise for you.

1061
01:17:02.086 --> 01:17:05.246
All right. One, two, three.

1062
01:17:09.089 --> 01:17:11.180
Will you listen to what I'm telling you?

1063
01:17:11.289 --> 01:17:12.916
Silicone is in everything.

1064
01:17:13.223 --> 01:17:16.447
It's in potato chips, it's in antacids.
Are you wearing lipstick?


1065
01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.849
What is this connective tissue disease?

1066
01:17:19.053 --> 01:17:22.918
I'm not sure these nice people
want to listen to that right now.


1067
01:17:22.988 --> 01:17:25.419
What are people doing today?
Where's the statistics?


1068
01:17:25.488 --> 01:17:27.818
- Happy birthday.
- Isn't that great?


1069
01:17:27.988 --> 01:17:30.712
Maybe you should think about this
in another way.


1070
01:17:30.785 --> 01:17:32.581
In the way of a balance.

1071
01:17:32.653 --> 01:17:34.642
Nature has a balance...

1072
01:17:34.721 --> 01:17:39.617
which you should explore the possibility
that you have, in a karmic sense, upset.


1073
01:17:40.786 --> 01:17:42.477
A karmic sense?

1074
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:46.380
20,000 lawsuits and Dow's lawyers
are talking about settling.


1075
01:17:46.450 --> 01:17:47.677
May I have the keys?

1076
01:17:47.751 --> 01:17:50.685
They're frightened.
It'll cost more to fight even if they win.


1077
01:17:50.753 --> 01:17:52.742
- The goddamn car keys!
- Economic realities.


1078
01:17:52.819 --> 01:17:56.145
What do you need the car keys for?
Where are you going?


1079
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:59.846
I'm guilty because of my karma?
Is that what you're saying?


1080
01:17:59.915 --> 01:18:03.510
You're gonna talk to me about my karma?
Go ahead.


1081
01:18:04.486 --> 01:18:06.315
You're fucked.

1082
01:18:06.786 --> 01:18:09.613
You are really fucked, karmically.

1083
01:18:13.816 --> 01:18:14.907
Get out.

1084
01:18:15.017 --> 01:18:17.348
- Damn bastards.
- I gotta get going.


1085
01:18:17.952 --> 01:18:20.281
There's one or two more here.

1086
01:18:21.184 --> 01:18:24.080
We'll have the last laugh
when the truth comes out.


1087
01:18:26.281 --> 01:18:28.976
20,000 court cases, but...

1088
01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:31.941
they got no evidence.

1089
01:18:42.048 --> 01:18:44.446
Do you want to see the evidence?

1090
01:18:45.615 --> 01:18:46.875
There.

1091
01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:50.469
Right there. Maria Stern.

1092
01:18:50.713 --> 01:18:51.941
38 years old.

1093
01:18:52.146 --> 01:18:54.704
Can't even get to church on Sunday.

1094
01:18:54.813 --> 01:18:56.678
I'm going on record right now...

1095
01:18:56.749 --> 01:19:00.044
and saying
that science can be bought today.


1096
01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:01.743
Take a good look at that.

1097
01:19:01.811 --> 01:19:04.710
That's what an explanted
silicone implant looks like.


1098
01:19:04.779 --> 01:19:08.769
Brought to you by the same people
who brought you Agent Orange.


1099
01:19:10.047 --> 01:19:12.674
Lawyers don't give a damn about women.

1100
01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:17.835
Money comes in, they knock them
out of the way to get their 50 percent first.


1101
01:19:17.911 --> 01:19:20.809
I do blame Dr. Saunders
and I do blame Dr. Larson!


1102
01:19:20.878 --> 01:19:24.404
I think they made millions and they knew!

1103
01:19:25.381 --> 01:19:26.676
They knew...

1104
01:19:28.543 --> 01:19:31.101
that these things
were making women sick!


1105
01:19:31.177 --> 01:19:32.234
I got one.

1106
01:19:32.610 --> 01:19:37.101
How many lawyers does it take
to kick a nun's teeth in for 50 cents?


1107
01:19:37.811 --> 01:19:39.243
How many?

1108
01:19:40.345 --> 01:19:41.969
Hell, all of them!

1109
01:19:47.276 --> 01:19:48.798
All of them.

1110
01:19:52.978 --> 01:19:55.941
We, the jury, in the above-entitled action...

1111
01:19:56.175 --> 01:19:59.266
find the defendant,
Dow Corning Corporation...


1112
01:19:59.676 --> 01:20:04.609
guilty of willful misconduct
and award the plaintiff $200,000...


1113
01:20:04.942 --> 01:20:07.805
$840,000 in compensatory damages...

1114
01:20:08.609 --> 01:20:10.664
$6.5 million in punitive damage...

1115
01:20:11.308 --> 01:20:14.502
$25 million, including punitive damages.

1116
01:20:16.075 --> 01:20:20.008
There's no proven correlation
between the sick women and the implants.


1117
01:20:20.077 --> 01:20:22.470
Thank you. No more questions.

1118
01:20:23.673 --> 01:20:26.868
I've never seen a jury so flagrantly biased.

1119
01:20:27.541 --> 01:20:28.528
Shut up.

1120
01:20:28.608 --> 01:20:31.769
This isn't over yet, we'll appeal.
This judge is an idiot.


1121
01:20:31.843 --> 01:20:35.739
I've heard enough out of you.
I said I want you to shut up.


1122
01:20:37.805 --> 01:20:39.294
Hello, Kevin.

1123
01:20:42.609 --> 01:20:44.631
Been golfing any lately?

1124
01:20:45.808 --> 01:20:46.831
No.

1125
01:20:48.772 --> 01:20:50.670
My game's gone to hell.

1126
01:20:50.839 --> 01:20:54.328
Today, I'm requesting a moratorium...

1127
01:20:54.639 --> 01:20:59.596
on the further use
of all silicone gel breast implants.


1128
01:20:59.873 --> 01:21:04.497
David Kessler should read the Mayo Clinic
and the Harvard Medical School studies.


1129
01:21:04.572 --> 01:21:07.503
The number of sick women with implants
is proportional...


1130
01:21:07.571 --> 01:21:09.970
to the sick women
in the general population.


1131
01:21:10.238 --> 01:21:14.499
You think anyone is gonna want
to introduce a new medical product...


1132
01:21:14.571 --> 01:21:16.763
after what happened here?

1133
01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:20.593
You couldn't get aspirin approved
by the FDA today.


1134
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:25.567
I don't doubt that these women
are genuinely sick and I feel sorry for them.


1135
01:21:25.639 --> 01:21:27.260
The question is, "Why?"

1136
01:21:27.636 --> 01:21:30.330
The problem is that the majority...

1137
01:21:30.836 --> 01:21:33.826
the women who are happy
with their implants...


1138
01:21:34.004 --> 01:21:38.495
aren't gonna stand up
at their next town meeting and say:


1139
01:21:38.572 --> 01:21:43.523
"Excuse me, I have augmented breasts
and I'm pleased as Punch with them."


1140
01:21:44.102 --> 01:21:46.330
We got a lottery mentality in this country.

1141
01:21:46.569 --> 01:21:49.967
It tells us, "Why work
when you can sue someone?"


1142
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:54.063
If they're gonna ban anything...

1143
01:21:54.568 --> 01:21:58.162
why don't they ban
the silicone penile implants?


1144
01:21:58.268 --> 01:21:59.755
Know why they don't?

1145
01:21:59.935 --> 01:22:02.126
Because half of Congress has them.

1146
01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:04.929
And they're nothing but
a bunch of goddamn hypocrites!


1147
01:22:05.002 --> 01:22:06.026
How do you explain...

1148
01:22:06.102 --> 01:22:10.534
the medical community's
own reluctance to support you?


1149
01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:14.930
You work hard all your life.

1150
01:22:16.302 --> 01:22:18.358
You are trying...

1151
01:22:19.267 --> 01:22:22.389
to live a life
that is decent and honest.

1152
01:22:22.632 --> 01:22:24.825
You're trying to help people.

1153
01:22:25.598 --> 01:22:27.565
You anticipate that...

1154
01:22:27.766 --> 01:22:30.359
one day you'll be told thank you.

1155
01:22:31.268 --> 01:22:33.491
But instead, you're attacked.

1156
01:22:34.031 --> 01:22:36.760
It's like the goddamn sky opened up...

1157
01:22:36.898 --> 01:22:39.422
and you're assaulted with this...

1158
01:22:40.065 --> 01:22:43.500
vicious, mean-spirited...

1159
01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:51.828
Hell. I forgot, 
I don't know what it is.

1160
01:22:53.631 --> 01:22:54.825
I don't know.

1161
01:22:54.965 --> 01:22:58.294
- We're gonna take a break...
- It's a bunch of bullshit.


1162
01:22:59.133 --> 01:23:03.756
If you have silicone breast implants
and are experiencing these symptoms...


1163
01:23:03.831 --> 01:23:07.024
please call 1-800
-RUPTURE.

1164
01:23:28.628 --> 01:23:31.822
- A lot of girls say they're getting sick.
- Did you talk to them?


1165
01:23:32.562 --> 01:23:33.549
I'm not a doctor.

1166
01:23:33.628 --> 01:23:36.961
I know you're not a doctor.
Did you explain to them?


1167
01:23:37.031 --> 01:23:41.584
- I didn't explain. All I know...
- Even if there's a leak, it gets trapped.


1168
01:23:42.228 --> 01:23:45.125
There's a capsule of scar tissue.

1169
01:23:45.194 --> 01:23:47.683
The girls feel uncomfortable
when you're around.


1170
01:23:47.761 --> 01:23:50.228
- There's no risk involved.
- Go home.


1171
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:53.283
Go home and don't come back.

1172
01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:58.992
Fuck you.

1173
01:24:33.057 --> 01:24:36.181
The instant I saw them,
I knew I'd made a horrible mistake.


1174
01:24:36.256 --> 01:24:39.018
I was paranoid.
I felt like everyone would look at me...


1175
01:24:39.091 --> 01:24:41.717
and know that I was vain
and insecure and say:


1176
01:24:42.424 --> 01:24:44.891
"Jesus, who do you think you're fooling?"

1177
01:24:45.293 --> 01:24:49.120
- Why not have them removed?
- Like I need to have more explaining to do.


1178
01:24:52.256 --> 01:24:55.815
You have sinus trouble? A little bit? Okay.

1179
01:24:56.058 --> 01:24:58.490
That shouldn't be a problem.

1180
01:24:58.759 --> 01:25:02.518
I have to ask a few more questions.
Do you have Medicaid?


1181
01:25:02.588 --> 01:25:04.054
Medicado?

1182
01:25:04.289 --> 01:25:06.949
I can try and strip them.

1183
01:25:09.558 --> 01:25:13.419
That's pretty expensive
and insurance won't cover it.


1184
01:25:16.621 --> 01:25:20.781
Why don't I just recommend
a good pair of support hose?


1185
01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:35.979
Hi.

1186
01:25:36.688 --> 01:25:37.712
How are you?

1187
01:25:41.185 --> 01:25:42.516
Not good.

1188
01:25:44.486 --> 01:25:46.111
I've been sick.

1189
01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:49.878
What's the matter?

1190
01:25:50.021 --> 01:25:52.984
What are your symptoms?

1191
01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:59.379
I'm tired.

1192
01:26:00.253 --> 01:26:02.549
I'm tired all the time.

1193
01:26:04.821 --> 01:26:06.750
My mouth is dry.

1194
01:26:07.017 --> 01:26:09.109
My eyes are dry.

1195
01:26:10.150 --> 01:26:12.117
I have this...

1196
01:26:13.518 --> 01:26:17.645
constant pain on the
left side of my body.

1197
01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:23.113
The scariest part is...

1198
01:26:24.351 --> 01:26:26.781
nobody can seem to tell me why.

1199
01:26:30.452 --> 01:26:33.711
We're gonna do a complete workup on you.

1200
01:26:34.816 --> 01:26:38.010
Take some blood. 
Let me get the nurse.

1201
01:26:38.882 --> 01:26:40.779
I just want them out.

1202
01:26:42.115 --> 01:26:45.603
I figured that you put them in...

1203
01:26:46.082 --> 01:26:48.912
so you'd know best
how to take them out.


1204
01:26:51.048 --> 01:26:52.844
I just want them out.

1205
01:27:28.279 --> 01:27:30.973
Doctor, I'm going to the ladies' room.

1206
01:27:54.076 --> 01:27:56.907
I wouldn't think of it as a removal,
so to speak.


1207
01:27:56.978 --> 01:28:00.239
You're actually acquiring
a new sense of well-being.


1208
01:28:00.511 --> 01:28:05.600
We'll explant the silicone implant, which
will be fully covered by your insurance.


1209
01:28:05.675 --> 01:28:10.075
If you want to swap, I think you'll be
very happy with our new saline implants.


1210
01:28:10.143 --> 01:28:12.632
Of course, you'll have peace of mind.

1211
01:28:12.711 --> 01:28:15.406
It's a personal choice. 
I know it's not easy.

1212
01:28:15.478 --> 01:28:19.373
The point is to take away the worry
so you can focus on what really matters.


1213
01:28:19.442 --> 01:28:20.738
It's your body.

1214
01:28:20.809 --> 01:28:23.775
That's what is important,
that you feel comfortable.


1215
01:28:23.842 --> 01:28:28.070
I like to think of saline as a natural,
more organic procedure.


1216
01:28:28.142 --> 01:28:30.803
I'm sorry this whole thing
has made you depressed.


1217
01:28:30.877 --> 01:28:35.273
The point now is not to be depressed,
but to take positive action.


1218
01:28:35.374 --> 01:28:38.829
Perhaps trading up to a larger size
would be a pick-me-up.


1219
01:28:38.908 --> 01:28:42.671
My original implant contained saline.
I told them from the start: saline.


1220
01:28:42.742 --> 01:28:46.229
You'll get two free visits
and a holistic mineral and relaxation kit.


1221
01:28:46.474 --> 01:28:51.428
Tension and anxiety are the two
greatest causes of health problems.


1222
01:28:56.407 --> 01:29:01.064
Actually, you are making more
to take them out, aren't you?


1223
01:29:01.138 --> 01:29:05.004
$7,000 to put them in.
You charge me again?


1224
01:29:05.074 --> 01:29:08.733
You charge me again to take them out
and then...


1225
01:29:09.974 --> 01:29:12.665
To put in the
new ones, the safe ones...

1226
01:29:12.805 --> 01:29:16.170
You're charging me again.

1227
01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:20.732
It costs more to take them out.

1228
01:29:21.573 --> 01:29:22.867
Insurance covers 80 percent.

1229
01:29:22.938 --> 01:29:25.630
But you make more, actually.

1230
01:29:25.938 --> 01:29:28.529
$7,000 to put them in.

1231
01:29:28.770 --> 01:29:33.726
$4,800 to take them out,
another $2,000 for the saline.


1232
01:29:34.104 --> 01:29:36.504
Another $1,000 for the OR...

1233
01:29:39.370 --> 01:29:40.927
Okay, when do I schedule?

1234
01:29:41.003 --> 01:29:43.595
When can I schedule?

1235
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:47.198
When could we schedule?

1236
01:29:47.403 --> 01:29:49.529
You think we can
put in a larger size?

1237
01:29:49.604 --> 01:29:52.865
Call Keddrick and tell him to fix it
or get it out.


1238
01:29:53.204 --> 01:29:56.895
It's too fucking hot, that's why.
And it's not herbal.


1239
01:29:57.368 --> 01:29:59.460
I paid for an herbal sauna.

1240
01:29:59.569 --> 01:30:03.400
He sends me this goddamn
Marquis de Sade sauna.


1241
01:30:03.503 --> 01:30:07.228
It smells like shit
and it scalds anyone who steps into it!


1242
01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:08.932
Who else called?

1243
01:30:09.468 --> 01:30:12.458
Tell him I'll call him back.
I should be in soon.


1244
01:30:12.603 --> 01:30:15.536
All right? So I'm right around the corner.

1245
01:30:20.834 --> 01:30:21.926
Fuck!

1246
01:30:58.699 --> 01:31:02.562
I've always had a strong image
of what kind of space I wanted to occupy.


1247
01:31:02.631 --> 01:31:03.995
This just isn't it.

1248
01:31:11.164 --> 01:31:12.790
I'm not ashamed about spending money.

1249
01:31:12.864 --> 01:31:15.330
You have a nice car,
you pay for its upkeep, right?


1250
01:31:23.698 --> 01:31:26.322
My mom's like this '60s hippie...

1251
01:31:26.396 --> 01:31:30.090
who thinks breast implants are
part of some plot to control women.


1252
01:31:30.164 --> 01:31:32.892
People think only bimbos
and actresses get implants.


1253
01:31:32.965 --> 01:31:36.657
Why do I have to have 18-year-old,
shoulder-level breasts, anyway?


1254
01:31:36.730 --> 01:31:39.251
You can talk about beauty
being on the inside...


1255
01:31:39.328 --> 01:31:42.763
but no one's gonna come inside
unless you got curve appeal.


1256
01:31:42.862 --> 01:31:45.159
I run my own company,
I've got a nice house...


1257
01:31:45.229 --> 01:31:48.092
I feel breasts are
the real basis of femininity.


1258
01:31:48.163 --> 01:31:51.821
- I can get my stomach flatter at the gym.
- It's not the same as a penis.


1259
01:31:51.895 --> 01:31:54.758
They have form and function
based on the concept of giving.


1260
01:31:54.861 --> 01:31:58.021
A penis isn't on display,
it doesn't have to fill a sweater.


1261
01:31:58.162 --> 01:32:01.060
You have glands and nipples.
Everything you need.


1262
01:32:01.295 --> 01:32:04.282
Frankly to me,
all penises look pretty much the same.


1263
01:32:04.361 --> 01:32:05.850
See how naturally they move?

1264
01:32:05.928 --> 01:32:07.517
My doctor is an artist.

1265
01:32:07.593 --> 01:32:10.152
He has a vision of how
the female body should look.


1266
01:32:10.259 --> 01:32:13.488
For women, breasts are the body part
that most profoundly...


1267
01:32:13.727 --> 01:32:15.990
It's my body, I've
got to live with it.

1268
01:32:16.194 --> 01:32:20.682
After I got them, men who never
noticed me were dying to go out with me.


1269
01:32:20.926 --> 01:32:23.757
They aren't all that important, are they?

1270
01:32:24.453 --> 01:32:26.885
Can I put my shirt back on now?
