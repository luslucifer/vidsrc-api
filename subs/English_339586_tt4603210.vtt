1
00:03:47.946 --> 00:03:50.066
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:03:51.946 --> 00:03:55.826
The demo which you're about to see,
and hopefully participate in...


3
00:03:55.906 --> 00:03:59.546
The original inventor of video games,
Ralph Baer.


4
00:04:00.426 --> 00:04:04.586
He was sitting there working for
a defence contractor in the United States


5
00:04:05.186 --> 00:04:07.866
in Manchester, 
New Hampshire, in 1968,

6
00:04:08.346 --> 00:04:12.826
and he was thinking that this technology
would let us bring stories home.


7
00:04:12.906 --> 00:04:16.266
And so he designed a box
called the Brown Box,


8
00:04:16.346 --> 00:04:17.706
which was all discrete.

9
00:04:17.786 --> 00:04:19.666
There were no microprocessors yet.

10
00:04:19.746 --> 00:04:22.826
And he didn't use
any integrated circuits at all,


11
00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:25.066
he just built discrete circuits

12
00:04:25.146 --> 00:04:28.306
that would create simple objects
on a TV screen


13
00:04:28.386 --> 00:04:30.826
and let a controller move them.

14
00:04:31.346 --> 00:04:36.386
And he sat there, he got it to work,
he got a lot of broad-ranging patents


15
00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:39.506
but his company was an aerospace company,

16
00:04:39.586 --> 00:04:42.426
they didn't know anything at all
about consumer electronics,


17
00:04:42.506 --> 00:04:45.746
so finally his company
hooked up with Magnavox,


18
00:04:45.826 --> 00:04:49.146
and they came out with
the Magnavox Odyssey.


19
00:04:51.306 --> 00:04:53.226
The electronic game of the future.

20
00:04:53.306 --> 00:04:56.946
Odyssey easily attaches to any brand TV,
black-and-white or colour,


21
00:04:57.026 --> 00:05:00.346
to create a closed-circuit
electronic playground.


22
00:05:00.426 --> 00:05:04.866
That was demonstrated in
the San Francisco Bay area in 1972,


23
00:05:05.266 --> 00:05:08.266
and Nolan Bushnell saw it.
And he was inspired.


24
00:05:08.826 --> 00:05:11.466
Now Bushnell had been thinking about

25
00:05:11.546 --> 00:05:14.866
bringing video games to the arcade world,

26
00:05:15.786 --> 00:05:19.106
and he'd been starting trying to figure out
how to take Computer Space,


27
00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:22.786
which was done with large computers
on vector monitors,


28
00:05:23.306 --> 00:05:24.946
and trying to come up
with something that did that.


29
00:05:25.026 --> 00:05:27.746
And that was all discrete logic too.

30
00:05:28.346 --> 00:05:31.986
But then he saw this easy, accessible game

31
00:05:32.986 --> 00:05:38.346
and he took the idea and he asked
Al Alcorn to build an implementation of it,


32
00:05:38.426 --> 00:05:40.426
and that became Atari Pong.

33
00:05:40.546 --> 00:05:42.666
That put Atari on the map.

34
00:05:42.746 --> 00:05:45.746
So that got Atari

35
00:05:45.826 --> 00:05:49.826
to be the leader in the arcade
video game business


36
00:05:49.906 --> 00:05:52.066
as opposed to
the home video game business,


37
00:05:52.146 --> 00:05:54.506
which Magnavox was the pioneer in.

38
00:05:54.586 --> 00:05:58.026
Then they started building
more complicated machines.


39
00:05:58.106 --> 00:06:00.066
They started with random logic,

40
00:06:00.146 --> 00:06:03.466
and then they started experimenting
with microprocessors.


41
00:06:03.546 --> 00:06:07.386
So then that set up a square
that was incomplete.


42
00:06:07.466 --> 00:06:10.066
There were home Pong-type games.

43
00:06:10.146 --> 00:06:12.947
There were arcade Pong-like games.

44
00:06:13.267 --> 00:06:16.467
There were more complicated
arcade video games


45
00:06:16.547 --> 00:06:19.147
and the place to complete was,

46
00:06:19.227 --> 00:06:24.867
"How can Atari, and their competitors,
bring the complicated games home?"


47
00:06:25.627 --> 00:06:29.747
That market problem was the one
that the Atari 2600,


48
00:06:30.427 --> 00:06:32.827
codenamed Stella, was intended to solve.

49
00:06:32.987 --> 00:06:35.067
Nolan bought a group of engineers

50
00:06:35.147 --> 00:06:37.267
called Cyan Engineering.

51
00:06:37.347 --> 00:06:38.787
They were up in Grass Valley.

52
00:06:38.867 --> 00:06:41.907
Steve Mayer, Larry Emmons, Ron Milner.

53
00:06:41.987 --> 00:06:45.227
They were the three engineers,
and Nolan tasked them with


54
00:06:45.347 --> 00:06:49.027
building a consumer version
of a coin-op game.


55
00:06:49.107 --> 00:06:50.947
They hired Joe Decuir,

56
00:06:51.027 --> 00:06:54.627
and the four of them
built a giant bread board.


57
00:06:54.707 --> 00:06:56.707
It was always gonna be a console,

58
00:06:56.787 --> 00:06:59.387
we knew it was gonna be programmable
in some fashion.


59
00:06:59.467 --> 00:07:01.667
But we were under a lot of pressure

60
00:07:01.747 --> 00:07:03.627
to keep the bill and materials down.

61
00:07:03.907 --> 00:07:06.267
To make it programmable would have meant

62
00:07:06.347 --> 00:07:08.987
to have some built-in ROM with a language.

63
00:07:09.067 --> 00:07:10.107
We would have needed some RAM

64
00:07:10.187 --> 00:07:12.907
to put the programs
that you were gonna create in.


65
00:07:12.987 --> 00:07:14.867
That would have made it more expensive.

66
00:07:14.947 --> 00:07:18.747
And we would've had to put in the cost
of some kind of keyboard controller.


67
00:07:18.827 --> 00:07:21.347
And we thought it
was too big a jump

68
00:07:21.427 --> 00:07:23.987
to go all the way to a personal computer
the first time.


69
00:07:24.067 --> 00:07:27.267
Jay Miner and Harold Lee
were the main chip guys,


70
00:07:27.347 --> 00:07:29.027
and Jay Miner did the whole design.

71
00:07:29.107 --> 00:07:30.907
So he took that giant bread board,

72
00:07:30.987 --> 00:07:33.107
and he was gonna push it down
to a single chip.


73
00:07:33.307 --> 00:07:35.547
He basically produced the TIA chip,

74
00:07:35.627 --> 00:07:37.507
which was the
Television Interface Adaptor chip,


75
00:07:37.587 --> 00:07:40.467
which shrunk 150 chips on a circuit board
in an arcade machine


76
00:07:40.547 --> 00:07:41.987
into one little tiny chip.

77
00:07:42.187 --> 00:07:43.747
So he had to throw
out a bunch of stuff

78
00:07:43.827 --> 00:07:46.427
that the Grass Valley guys had done,

79
00:07:46.507 --> 00:07:49.987
so we ended up having to do the software
and of course we complained bitterly.


80
00:07:50.067 --> 00:07:53.707
"Come on, Jay. I don't wanna write
horizontal syncs every line, just do it!"


81
00:07:54.627 --> 00:07:56.587
But the things that he threw out

82
00:07:56.667 --> 00:08:00.027
perfectly set up so that we could do
what we ended up doing.


83
00:08:00.267 --> 00:08:03.707
From the first crude Tank and Pong games,

84
00:08:03.787 --> 00:08:05.147
till Pitfall!

85
00:08:05.227 --> 00:08:09.187
We could have done a game
like Pitfall! graphics in 1976.


86
00:08:09.267 --> 00:08:10.907
We just didn't know how.

87
00:08:10.987 --> 00:08:14.107
The machine didn't change
over those six years,


88
00:08:14.187 --> 00:08:15.267
we did.

89
00:08:15.907 --> 00:08:17.867
And so, part of
that, or most of that,

90
00:08:17.947 --> 00:08:20.507
was because Jay left off
a whole bunch of stuff.


91
00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:23.677
People got very creative
within the first two,


92
00:08:23.702 --> 00:08:26.331
three years of the
lifespan of the VCS.


93
00:08:26.387 --> 00:08:31.787
And people did absolutely amazing and
staggeringly inventive things with that.


94
00:09:10.587 --> 00:09:11.787
We were aware of Apple.

95
00:09:11.867 --> 00:09:15.587
We knew they were going after
the appliance computer market


96
00:09:15.667 --> 00:09:19.107
with much higher costs,
and much different market.


97
00:09:19.387 --> 00:09:23.347
You have the Apple II,
which was a really advanced computer.


98
00:09:23.427 --> 00:09:26.347
It had all kind of capacity for expansion

99
00:09:26.427 --> 00:09:30.587
that would help it do things for business
and science and office workers.


100
00:09:31.307 --> 00:09:37.147
Meanwhile, Apple had cultivated a really
strong image as a computer company.


101
00:09:37.227 --> 00:09:39.507
Then you have the first Atari,
which is very limited,


102
00:09:40.107 --> 00:09:43.467
and gave them a reputation
as a game company.


103
00:09:43.907 --> 00:09:45.787
And we went after the console market

104
00:09:45.867 --> 00:09:48.627
because we were
an entertainment games company.


105
00:09:49.667 --> 00:09:53.107
And it helped us a lot
that we were thinking in those terms,


106
00:09:53.187 --> 00:09:56.067
and not in terms of productivity software.

107
00:09:56.307 --> 00:09:59.547
We re-wrestled that problem later
with our next machine.


108
00:10:00.307 --> 00:10:02.587
Atari brings the computer age home.

109
00:10:02.667 --> 00:10:05.187
- Gotta run, gotta go!
- Late again, Dad?


110
00:10:05.267 --> 00:10:06.707
With an Atari home computer...

111
00:10:06.787 --> 00:10:07.987
Have a nice day at the office!

112
00:10:08.067 --> 00:10:10.467
...you can easily work at home

113
00:10:10.547 --> 00:10:13.467
or open your home
to a world of possibilities.


114
00:10:13.547 --> 00:10:16.896
In fact, the hardest part about
owning an Atari home computer


115
00:10:16.921 --> 00:10:18.691
isn't how to use it,

116
00:10:18.747 --> 00:10:20.587
but who gets to use it.

117
00:10:20.667 --> 00:10:24.027
Market's closed, Dad. 
Mind if I do my work?

118
00:10:24.107 --> 00:10:25.707
Hey, nope, no problem.

119
00:10:25.787 --> 00:10:28.427
Atari Home Computers.
We've brought the computer age home.


120
00:10:28.947 --> 00:10:31.947
Jay Miner had become, sort of,
head of the chip group.


121
00:10:32.027 --> 00:10:38.747
Jay was the heart and soul behind
the Atari 400 and the Atari 800.


122
00:10:38.827 --> 00:10:41.107
When I was programming the 800 in 1980,

123
00:10:41.187 --> 00:10:44.987
I was stunned by just how clever
the design was.


124
00:10:45.427 --> 00:10:48.387
The Atari 400 and 800
personal computer systems


125
00:10:48.467 --> 00:10:50.907
have outstanding graphics capabilities.

126
00:10:51.427 --> 00:10:53.267
These features are made possible

127
00:10:53.347 --> 00:10:57.027
by three unique,
large-scale integrated circuit chips.


128
00:10:57.107 --> 00:10:59.708
Jay had divided into three chips this time,

129
00:10:59.788 --> 00:11:01.828
cos he couldn't fit
it all into one chip.

130
00:11:01.908 --> 00:11:03.908
So there was a
new version of the TIA,

131
00:11:03.988 --> 00:11:06.108
which we called the Colleen TIA.

132
00:11:06.188 --> 00:11:08.348
It handled sprites, missiles, balls.

133
00:11:08.708 --> 00:11:11.188
The ANTIC was the stuff that overflowed,

134
00:11:11.268 --> 00:11:12.908
that did more of the playfield graphics.

135
00:11:13.508 --> 00:11:15.028
And the ANTIC had something
that we invented,


136
00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:17.028
called the display list.

137
00:11:17.108 --> 00:11:19.028
So you give it a list of instructions,

138
00:11:19.108 --> 00:11:22.188
very simple ones,
telling it what to do on each line,


139
00:11:22.268 --> 00:11:25.628
so we didn't have to write kernels
to load the register.


140
00:11:25.708 --> 00:11:29.348
So this display list would load
those registers for us every line.


141
00:11:29.508 --> 00:11:31.908
And it controlled the line by itself.

142
00:11:31.988 --> 00:11:33.548
And the third chip was the POKEY chip,

143
00:11:34.308 --> 00:11:38.388
which stands for
"Potentiometers and Keyboard."


144
00:11:38.508 --> 00:11:41.148
So it did the joysticks, the pots,

145
00:11:41.228 --> 00:11:43.028
the keyboard, and the other peripherals.

146
00:11:43.308 --> 00:11:48.068
I think the most important thing
about those early chipsets,


147
00:11:48.548 --> 00:11:51.108
were that they recognised that

148
00:11:51.188 --> 00:11:54.988
computers could be about
a lot more than just crunching numbers.


149
00:11:55.668 --> 00:11:57.348
That computers could be fun.

150
00:11:57.428 --> 00:12:01.588
Computers could be engaging,
exciting, creative.


151
00:12:02.108 --> 00:12:04.068
And that it required

152
00:12:04.788 --> 00:12:08.748
a degree of technical
ingenuity and creativity


153
00:12:09.028 --> 00:12:12.268
that people simply weren't putting into
computers at that point,


154
00:12:12.348 --> 00:12:14.428
certainly not into computing technology.

155
00:12:14.508 --> 00:12:16.548
I mean, you look at
something like the Apple II.


156
00:12:16.628 --> 00:12:17.748
It was a good computer.

157
00:12:17.828 --> 00:12:20.028
You know, it would run
spreadsheets and so on,


158
00:12:20.108 --> 00:12:21.828
and even some primitive games.

159
00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:24.348
But there was a lot missing.

160
00:12:24.428 --> 00:12:26.788
And a lot of
the stuff that was missing

161
00:12:26.868 --> 00:12:28.908
was in the Atari 400 and 800 chipsets.

162
00:12:41.748 --> 00:12:44.788
At Atari,
Warner Communications bought them,


163
00:12:44.868 --> 00:12:46.788
they installed Ray Kassar as president.

164
00:12:46.908 --> 00:12:50.028
Best is yet to come, we have
terrific games coming out next year.


165
00:12:50.108 --> 00:12:53.948
We have E.T. for example,
a wonderful love story cartridge.


166
00:12:54.028 --> 00:12:55.908
I think there's great interest
in home computers,


167
00:12:55.988 --> 00:12:57.668
which Atari makes, and video games...

168
00:12:57.748 --> 00:13:02.108
They were essentially owned by
a entertainment media conglomerate,


169
00:13:02.188 --> 00:13:04.908
and Ray Kassar came from that culture.

170
00:13:04.988 --> 00:13:06.708
Now you have to realise

171
00:13:06.788 --> 00:13:10.508
that Nolan Bushnell
and Joe Keenan and Al Alcorn,


172
00:13:10.588 --> 00:13:12.788
they were basically goof-offs.

173
00:13:12.868 --> 00:13:16.068
Not quite hippies,
but you'd call them relaxed. Casual.


174
00:13:16.148 --> 00:13:17.428
They smoked dope.

175
00:13:17.508 --> 00:13:20.588
We went up to the Nolan suite
where we smoked a few joints.


176
00:13:20.668 --> 00:13:22.628
And so that was
the Atari that we knew.

177
00:13:22.868 --> 00:13:25.828
Ray comes in with his,
you know, $3,000 suits.


178
00:13:25.908 --> 00:13:29.228
He had a chauffeured limousine
that drove him up to the city.


179
00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:31.948
Ray Kassar was not a technical guy.

180
00:13:32.028 --> 00:13:33.908
He came from the fabric business.

181
00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:39.028
And he was a vice-president
at something called Burlington Industries,


182
00:13:39.108 --> 00:13:41.508
that makes towels and socks.

183
00:13:41.868 --> 00:13:44.388
He thought that you sold computers

184
00:13:44.748 --> 00:13:46.748
to women in designer colours.

185
00:13:46.828 --> 00:13:50.148
He gave a lecture to us
in Atari Engineering


186
00:13:50.588 --> 00:13:54.908
in late January, early February of 1979.

187
00:13:54.988 --> 00:13:56.748
And he told us this.

188
00:13:57.428 --> 00:14:01.468
Most of the women who worked at Atari
in engineering left within a month.


189
00:14:01.548 --> 00:14:03.868
They really just did not understand

190
00:14:03.948 --> 00:14:06.588
how to treat developers
and how to do engineering.


191
00:14:06.908 --> 00:14:10.228
He said, you know, "I've worked
with towel designers at Burlington."


192
00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:13.748
And they make those designs on the
towels, the fancy patterns and stuff.


193
00:14:13.828 --> 00:14:16.868
And he said,
"They consider themselves artists.


194
00:14:16.948 --> 00:14:20.828
"They think it's their art on the towel
that sells the towel."


195
00:14:20.908 --> 00:14:22.588
And he said,

196
00:14:22.668 --> 00:14:25.788
"I had to tell them,
'You guys are a dime a dozen.


197
00:14:25.868 --> 00:14:28.828
"'I could hire any idiot to design towels.

198
00:14:28.908 --> 00:14:30.908
"'And I wouldn't have
to pay them anything.'"


199
00:14:30.988 --> 00:14:33.948
And so he basically said
we were a dime a dozen,


200
00:14:34.028 --> 00:14:37.548
he didn't need to pay us anything cos
he could hire anybody to do what we do.


201
00:14:37.628 --> 00:14:39.148
It was just like towel design.

202
00:14:39.748 --> 00:14:42.708
And Jay Miner said,
"I don't like where this is going."


203
00:14:42.788 --> 00:14:46.148
Jay Miner, he wanted to continue the
work he'd done on the Atari 800.


204
00:14:46.228 --> 00:14:48.533
So, it was clear that they
weren't gonna be able to make


205
00:14:48.558 --> 00:14:49.892
any new technology at Atari.

206
00:14:49.948 --> 00:14:55.188
So he just left, and actually went to work
for a company making pacemaker chips.


207
00:14:56.348 --> 00:14:58.708
Zymos was a chip company,
they made chips.


208
00:14:58.948 --> 00:15:01.428
In those days you do RAM chips,

209
00:15:01.508 --> 00:15:05.228
you do peripheral chips, any kind of chip
that the company can do.


210
00:15:10.028 --> 00:15:13.148
While I was at Activision,
after I finished Kaboom!,


211
00:15:13.228 --> 00:15:15.668
I really wanted to
do a new game system.

212
00:15:15.788 --> 00:15:18.868
Atari still had not
come out with the 5200,

213
00:15:19.028 --> 00:15:22.068
they were still selling 400s and 800s.

214
00:15:22.148 --> 00:15:25.188
And Doug Neubauer
had called me up one day,


215
00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:26.828
and we were talking about it.

216
00:15:26.908 --> 00:15:30.388
I said, "Look, I wanna leave Activision,
I really wanna do a new game system."


217
00:15:30.468 --> 00:15:33.388
We both knew Jay
Miner, we talked about it.

218
00:15:33.708 --> 00:15:35.948
And he said, "Sure,"
he'd like to do it.

219
00:15:36.028 --> 00:15:39.068
Bert Braddock, the president of Zymos,
he liked the idea.


220
00:15:39.468 --> 00:15:42.388
So we put together, like,
a little business plan,


221
00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:44.908
and he presented it to his investor,

222
00:15:44.988 --> 00:15:47.629
who was a man named O.W. Rollins.

223
00:15:47.949 --> 00:15:50.469
He had put a
lot of money into Zymos,

224
00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:52.869
so Rollins said he'll invest money.

225
00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:55.869
It was just purely a game machine
with joysticks,


226
00:15:55.949 --> 00:15:58.629
and a simple console, nothing else.

227
00:15:58.709 --> 00:16:00.189
I guess at the time,

228
00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:03.349
with Atari doing so well
and everybody was talking about games,


229
00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:05.509
they really wanted to invest
in a game console.


230
00:16:05.589 --> 00:16:08.309
It looked like it was gonna do very well
for them at that time.


231
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:10.389
June of 1982,

232
00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:15.229
Rollins hired an executive search team
to find a president.


233
00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:17.269
And they found Dave Morse.

234
00:16:17.349 --> 00:16:18.869
Tonka Toys in Minnesota.

235
00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:22.629
And so Dave and I worked on
the business plan over the summer,


236
00:16:22.709 --> 00:16:25.069
and they basically
approved it in September.


237
00:16:25.149 --> 00:16:26.549
So, October of '82,

238
00:16:26.989 --> 00:16:30.029
Rollins agreed to spend $3 million

239
00:16:30.109 --> 00:16:32.389
to fund, at that time, Hi
-Toro.

240
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:34.829
This is, of course,
the season to be jolly,

241
00:16:34.909 --> 00:16:37.109
but the folks at Mattel
and Warner Communications


242
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:38.509
and a lot of other companies

243
00:16:38.589 --> 00:16:40.909
are having trouble
getting into the holiday spirit.


244
00:16:40.989 --> 00:16:44.149
Sales down dramatically
for home video game cartridges


245
00:16:44.229 --> 00:16:46.029
and investors are bailing out.

246
00:16:46.109 --> 00:16:47.469
Scott Barrett reports.

247
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:50.949
Warner Communications down
one and a quarter points today,


248
00:16:51.029 --> 00:16:52.869
16 and three quarter points yesterday.

249
00:16:53.029 --> 00:16:55.789
Mattel down
seven and a quarter points today.


250
00:16:55.869 --> 00:16:59.229
Both companies have one important
Christmas season product in common:


251
00:16:59.909 --> 00:17:01.749
home video game cartridges.

252
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:05.909
What happened with Atari was that
they got really big really quickly,


253
00:17:05.989 --> 00:17:08.738
and then they forgot that
technology was gonna keep going,


254
00:17:08.763 --> 00:17:10.253
it was going to get better.

255
00:17:10.509 --> 00:17:15.749
They started to think of their Atari
video computer system, the 2600,


256
00:17:16.149 --> 00:17:17.749
kind of like a television,

257
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:20.669
thinking there's gonna be one of these in
every home, it's like an appliance.


258
00:17:21.229 --> 00:17:25.309
And Atari, nevertheless, felt like they
could ride that horse for years and years.


259
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:28.629
Naturally, it was going to hit a wall
very, very quickly,


260
00:17:28.709 --> 00:17:31.989
and they overbuilt the company
around that assumption.


261
00:17:32.309 --> 00:17:35.869
And they didn't really plan that
effectively for a next generation.


262
00:17:35.949 --> 00:17:37.162
And so it went up really fast,

263
00:17:37.187 --> 00:17:39.653
and then it turned around and
it came down really fast.


264
00:17:39.709 --> 00:17:43.709
Just like the laws of physics,
what goes up must come down.


265
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:48.749
And then they made a great big
implosion when they crashed,


266
00:17:48.829 --> 00:17:51.909
and they kind of sucked the entire
industry down with them for a while.


267
00:17:51.989 --> 00:17:54.236
All the game companies were losing money.

268
00:17:54.261 --> 00:17:56.293
Mattel, 20th Century Fox, Hasbro.

269
00:17:56.349 --> 00:17:59.069
All of those others companies,
Imagic, they all went broke.


270
00:17:59.789 --> 00:18:02.629
And retailers and distributors
refused to carry anything.


271
00:18:02.709 --> 00:18:05.549
We were telling our sales
people at Electronic Arts


272
00:18:05.629 --> 00:18:08.549
to go find all the guys
who are carrying Atari,


273
00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:10.229
and they came back and said,
"They're all gone.


274
00:18:10.309 --> 00:18:11.909
"They all went out of
business or shut down.


275
00:18:11.989 --> 00:18:14.389
"They don't want to do anything
with any more video games."


276
00:18:14.469 --> 00:18:18.989
It was very difficult in the early '80s
trying to rebuild all of that distribution.


277
00:18:19.069 --> 00:18:23.909
Nobody, no single American
toy store, distributor,


278
00:18:23.989 --> 00:18:26.189
nobody wanted to hear the word
"video game."


279
00:18:26.269 --> 00:18:29.429
They'd all lost their shirt,
and they would never touch them again.


280
00:18:29.509 --> 00:18:31.269
There is one encouraging note
for the industry,


281
00:18:31.349 --> 00:18:33.349
while software sales may be slumping,

282
00:18:33.429 --> 00:18:36.109
and of course "software" is a
computer buff term for that


283
00:18:36.189 --> 00:18:39.269
video cartridge that contains
the game program,


284
00:18:39.349 --> 00:18:41.549
hardware sales are still soaring.

285
00:18:41.629 --> 00:18:44.629
Most hardware can double
as a personal computer,


286
00:18:44.709 --> 00:18:47.669
leading most optimistic industry experts
to conclude


287
00:18:47.749 --> 00:18:50.469
that video game players
may be tired of playing


288
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:53.629
and are now getting down to
the serious business of computing.


289
00:18:53.869 --> 00:18:57.829
And so, the only market available at
that time really was the computer.


290
00:18:57.949 --> 00:19:01.829
If you started in 1983 with an idea
for a new company,


291
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:03.389
you could not do a video game.

292
00:19:03.469 --> 00:19:06.069
There was just absolutely no possibility,

293
00:19:06.149 --> 00:19:09.269
because there wasn't a distributor
or retailer that would talk to you.


294
00:19:09.349 --> 00:19:12.789
And the Consumer Electronic Shows,
they disappeared.


295
00:19:12.869 --> 00:19:15.269
If you went to the show
in, say, June of '83,


296
00:19:15.349 --> 00:19:17.629
there were almost no video games
there at all.


297
00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:22.069
Jay Miner had already begun a project

298
00:19:22.389 --> 00:19:26.029
to design a low-cost super computer

299
00:19:26.109 --> 00:19:28.829
based on the Motorola 68000 chip,

300
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:33.669
which at that time, was only being used
in high-end workstations.


301
00:19:33.749 --> 00:19:35.469
Dave learned about it

302
00:19:35.629 --> 00:19:41.309
and the two of them decided
to go back to the original backer


303
00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:46.589
and propose that they make a
few changes to the strategy,


304
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:50.709
but basically fund the continuation
of this project.


305
00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:56.869
The changes were not only to target
the low-end business market,


306
00:19:56.949 --> 00:19:58.869
which is what Jay had in mind,

307
00:19:59.149 --> 00:20:02.949
but also to target the
home computer market,


308
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:05.909
including the ability to do
dazzling video games.


309
00:20:07.069 --> 00:20:09.869
So that was the element that Dave added.

310
00:20:09.949 --> 00:20:13.509
Dave Morse was what I consider to be
a marketing genius,


311
00:20:14.749 --> 00:20:19.189
well under-considered in terms of, I think,
an awful lot of people.


312
00:20:19.269 --> 00:20:20.749
Very creative.

313
00:20:20.829 --> 00:20:22.479
And his directive to us

314
00:20:22.504 --> 00:20:27.093
was he wanted to be able to
animate cartoons in real time.


315
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:30.469
So we again listed,
"What do we need for a game?


316
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:31.989
"What do we need for productivity?

317
00:20:32.069 --> 00:20:34.470
"Let's make sure we can cover
both of them in the same set."


318
00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:40.110
At that point, the only real game in town
in the low-end business market


319
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.430
and also high-end home market

320
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:43.950
was the Apple IIe.

321
00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.910
They had owned that market
for a long, long time,


322
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:50.510
and Dave felt it wasn't a
terribly exciting computer.


323
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.510
There was also all the
Commodore computers.


324
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.030
And Commodore was very big at the time.

325
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:57.590
They had sold millions and millions
of these small home computers.


326
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.470
Ghostbusters!

327
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.670
So the idea of taking that idea
and really extending it


328
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.950
and giving those a lot more
graphic capability, a lot more power,


329
00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:20.910
you know, the multitasking
as well as really good sound,


330
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:24.630
it was just the next step in the evolution
of personal computing.


331
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:31.590
I have a notebook from Atari
which has a preview of the Amiga.


332
00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:35.630
I wrote that preview in June of 1979.

333
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:39.910
And so when Jay called me up
in the fall of 1982 and said,


334
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:43.670
"Let's come up with a new machine,"
I was ready to go.


335
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:48.630
So I went and met Jay in October of 1982,
and we started planning out this system.


336
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:52.150
So I worked as
a consultant for Jay Miner.

337
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:55.030
I was badge number three at
what was then called Hi-Toro.


338
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:59.950
While I was working with Jay finishing
up the clock chip at Apple,


339
00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:02.630
and of course we'd go out for lunch
every now and then,


340
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.790
I was in the Macintosh lab.

341
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:08.990
And my lab bench was very near
Dan Kottke's,


342
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:12.030
another early engineer
on the Macintosh project,


343
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:16.470
and he was adding a test connector
to the Mac motherboard.


344
00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:20.950
And Steve Jobs comes over and says,
"What's that?"


345
00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.770
There are various stories
about Steve Jobs


346
00:22:22.795 --> 00:22:24.454
walking up to an
engineer and going,


347
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:25.630
"What are you doing?"

348
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.910
And Dan Kottke says,
"I'm putting in a test connector."


349
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:31.750
And Steve goes, "What test connector?
What do you want to test?" And he says,


350
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:36.550
"Well, various things, like an option,
for instance, for a colour adaptor."


351
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:38.910
And then Steve goes
on this rant about how

352
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:42.830
the Mac is a black-and-white
high-resolution monochrome computer,


353
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:45.510
"It'll never have colour,
I don't want you playing with colour.


354
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:47.710
"Please remove that test connector."

355
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:51.150
Right? And Steve rants about this
and goes tromping off.


356
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:55.470
So I'm saying, "OK, Steve doesn't want
to do a colour Macintosh."


357
00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:59.150
At the next lunch I went
to with Jay, Jay says,


358
00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:02.666
"I've got some investors who
want to start a company


359
00:23:02.691 --> 00:23:04.894
to do a colour game machine."

360
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:08.430
And I'm going, "Hey, I've always been
interested in colour,


361
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.270
"and Steve says he's not interested in it."

362
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:15.470
And so, I jumped at the opportunity
to do something new and creative.


363
00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.148
I worked in the early stages,

364
00:23:17.173 --> 00:23:20.534
so I worked with Jay and Ron
and very few other people.


365
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.950
And we spent an awful lot of our time
on the whiteboard...


366
00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:26.510
Saying, "No, no. That's all wrong,"
and erasing it all.


367
00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.630
We went through several weeks there,

368
00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.350
of just throwing ideas around
of what we wanted to do.


369
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.960
And then we would go to
the giant drawing table


370
00:23:35.985 --> 00:23:37.934
and start drawing all this stuff

371
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:41.310
because we didn't have
good computer-aided design tools yet.


372
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:45.310
We were still designing on vellums

373
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.870
and we'd get these big tables
with fluorescent lights under them


374
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.950
and do it manually by hand.

375
00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:55.470
It was just the three of
us for several months


376
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.343
until we had all the design,

377
00:23:58.368 --> 00:24:02.414
except for maybe three
features, finalised.


378
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:05.670
At that time Amiga was looking to expand.

379
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.310
I go down there,
I get out at the Sunnyvale train station,


380
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:10.550
there's this big old guy with a beard,

381
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:13.430
in a Lincoln,
and this little dog sitting at one window.


382
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:17.670
And I thought, "This is
an interesting guy."


383
00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.070
And then I guessed correctly

384
00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:23.990
when he asked me the difference
between a flip-flop and a latch.


385
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.110
And we hit it off.
So I said, "I gotta work for this guy."


386
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.852
They invited me to
come out and interview


387
00:24:29.877 --> 00:24:32.854
and I blew off their invitation twice.

388
00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:34.590
Two times!

389
00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.710
I said, "OK, I'll think about it."

390
00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:40.470
And then I decided I wasn't going to do it
because it was just too wacky.


391
00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:43.230
It's a bunch of people out in California,

392
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:45.630
they're going to go
and create a new computer,


393
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.590
and, sure, this is a great idea.

394
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:51.870
And my family, especially my mom, they
were warning me, "Out in California..."


395
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.394
"California is the land
of fruit and nuts,"


396
00:24:54.419 --> 00:24:56.974
is what they all used
to say to me back then.


397
00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:59.190
And though I blew them off twice,
they kept calling.


398
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.110
Thankfully, they called the third time. And
the third time, I accepted and went out.


399
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:03.830
I actually missed my first interview.

400
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:09.390
What I had heard about it was that there
was a small start-up company and so...


401
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:11.830
Scheduled an interview,
and it was on a Friday night.


402
00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:16.550
And HP typically has these things called
beer busts, at that time, on Friday night.


403
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:20.070
And about 8:30,
after quite a bit of wine at the beer bust,


404
00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:21.870
I suddenly remembered I was supposed to

405
00:25:21.951 --> 00:25:25.071
go to an interview at Amiga
with Bob Pariseau.


406
00:25:25.151 --> 00:25:28.191
And so I called
him up in a panic,

407
00:25:28.271 --> 00:25:31.271
and he said, "No, no problem.
Just come in next week."


408
00:25:31.351 --> 00:25:32.471
And so I went in,

409
00:25:32.631 --> 00:25:36.951
they had the whiteboard with the 68000
as one of the key elements,


410
00:25:37.031 --> 00:25:40.551
and then they showed the chips
and the basic architecture


411
00:25:40.631 --> 00:25:42.751
and fairly quickly made up my mind

412
00:25:42.831 --> 00:25:45.951
that I wanted to leave HP
and join this company.


413
00:25:46.031 --> 00:25:51.431
My wife got a call from a head-hunter
and then from Bob Pariseau,


414
00:25:51.511 --> 00:25:54.551
who was the head of software at Amiga.

415
00:25:55.191 --> 00:25:59.791
And it's funny because she felt he was
very rude on the telephone,


416
00:25:59.871 --> 00:26:02.031
and said, "Don't call this guy back.

417
00:26:02.111 --> 00:26:04.871
"You don't want to talk to this...
I don't want you working for..."


418
00:26:04.951 --> 00:26:07.871
"For this guy and his company."

419
00:26:08.631 --> 00:26:11.191
But I had a friend who
had interviewed there


420
00:26:11.271 --> 00:26:15.031
for the operating system job,
and he decided it wasn't for him,


421
00:26:15.111 --> 00:26:18.031
but he called me up and he said,
"You really should go talk to these guys


422
00:26:18.111 --> 00:26:21.711
"because they want to create
a whole new computer system,


423
00:26:21.791 --> 00:26:24.111
"and they want to do a whole
operating system from scratch


424
00:26:24.191 --> 00:26:26.551
"and I was thinking maybe you'd be
interested in that."


425
00:26:27.111 --> 00:26:30.071
So I went down to the interview
and interviewed with Bob Pariseau


426
00:26:30.191 --> 00:26:32.831
and met some of the other
guys there, Dave Morse.


427
00:26:33.151 --> 00:26:36.991
And then they made me
an offer the same day

428
00:26:37.071 --> 00:26:38.551
and I couldn't refuse. 
I accepted it.

429
00:26:38.631 --> 00:26:44.711
I was talking to, what was at that time,
"a talent agent" for technology people.


430
00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:48.111
And he introduced me
to this company, Amiga,


431
00:26:48.191 --> 00:26:51.191
that was doing something interesting.

432
00:26:51.271 --> 00:26:54.631
I went down, I took a look.
I saw the whiteboard.


433
00:26:54.711 --> 00:26:58.591
I just knew, without question,
that this is what I wanted to work on.


434
00:26:58.671 --> 00:27:00.831
Of course,
I completely screwed up the interview.


435
00:27:00.911 --> 00:27:04.031
And Morse threw me out and said,
"Go away, don't bother me, little boy."


436
00:27:04.111 --> 00:27:08.511
But I was being massively,
totally arrogant. It was awful.


437
00:27:08.591 --> 00:27:10.351
The next morning, I call back.

438
00:27:10.431 --> 00:27:14.351
And I apologised and I tell Dave Morse
how sorry I am that I behaved that way,


439
00:27:14.431 --> 00:27:17.351
and I really, really want to just
work on that machine.


440
00:27:17.431 --> 00:27:19.031
And he says, "OK, fine. Come in."

441
00:27:19.111 --> 00:27:22.351
And I came in
and he handed me off to Tom Cahill


442
00:27:22.431 --> 00:27:24.511
who was running the lab at the time.

443
00:27:24.591 --> 00:27:28.591
And they put me to work
sweeping the place clean,


444
00:27:28.671 --> 00:27:32.191
picking up parts, putting them back
in the bins where they belong.


445
00:27:32.271 --> 00:27:35.351
And so I started
at Amiga as a janitor.

446
00:27:35.431 --> 00:27:38.231
And loved it, and had to be there
and it was amazing.


447
00:27:47.831 --> 00:27:50.210
One of the things I saw
during my interview at Amiga


448
00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:51.535
was a little whiteboard.

449
00:27:51.591 --> 00:27:55.191
I think a lot of the guys talk about this
that were on the original Amiga team.


450
00:27:55.271 --> 00:27:58.071
And it was a whiteboard that had a
diagram of how the system worked


451
00:27:58.151 --> 00:28:00.271
in terms of its system architecture.

452
00:28:00.351 --> 00:28:04.751
And it was really quite elegant and it was
also a multiprocessing architecture,


453
00:28:04.831 --> 00:28:07.431
where multiple things can be happening
at the same time.


454
00:28:07.511 --> 00:28:09.151
And as soon as I
looked at that, I knew

455
00:28:09.231 --> 00:28:12.231
that multitasking was going to be
required to make that work well.


456
00:28:12.311 --> 00:28:16.151
To be able to coordinate all the different
parts of the system at the same time.


457
00:28:16.911 --> 00:28:20.911
The magical, incredible drawing
on that whiteboard


458
00:28:20.991 --> 00:28:24.151
that showed an amazing architecture.

459
00:28:24.231 --> 00:28:26.111
Multiple buses,

460
00:28:26.191 --> 00:28:30.031
ways to get the graphics out of regular
memory and on to video


461
00:28:30.111 --> 00:28:32.631
without stopping the processor.

462
00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:35.031
Real audio? Holy cow.

463
00:28:35.311 --> 00:28:37.271
It had additional features

464
00:28:37.351 --> 00:28:40.311
that were already plotted out
on this whiteboard


465
00:28:40.391 --> 00:28:44.751
that made it clear, in advance,
that Jay Miner and company intended


466
00:28:44.991 --> 00:28:48.191
to create a real computer,
not just a game system.


467
00:28:48.271 --> 00:28:50.751
But they intended to create something
that could have a keyboard


468
00:28:50.831 --> 00:28:52.551
if you wanted it to have a keyboard.

469
00:28:52.991 --> 00:28:57.511
It could have external drive capability
if you wanted to expand it.


470
00:28:57.591 --> 00:29:00.231
Memory expansion
if you wanted to expand the system.


471
00:29:01.511 --> 00:29:05.751
So, the process of creating the Amiga
was one where


472
00:29:05.831 --> 00:29:07.951
we went back and forth between

473
00:29:08.031 --> 00:29:10.191
how much do we want to make it
a game machine,


474
00:29:10.271 --> 00:29:13.671
how much do we want to make it a tool
or a utility like a real computer,


475
00:29:13.751 --> 00:29:16.311
or like a IBM
-PC type of thing.

476
00:29:16.751 --> 00:29:18.511
And we tried to balance that

477
00:29:18.591 --> 00:29:20.831
through the whole process
of making the computer.


478
00:29:20.911 --> 00:29:23.991
And it was a difficult balance
to make along the way.


479
00:29:24.071 --> 00:29:27.511
Because those are such different markets
and such different types of usages.


480
00:29:28.111 --> 00:29:32.431
We relied on a lot of the concepts
that had already been developed.


481
00:29:32.511 --> 00:29:36.671
Grand UNIX systems,
grand Sun Microsystems sorts of things,


482
00:29:36.751 --> 00:29:40.991
where they had tackled
giant operating systems


483
00:29:41.071 --> 00:29:42.991
and figured out the
right way to do it.

484
00:29:43.431 --> 00:29:47.711
We wanted to do that, too.
We wanted to create that kind of power.


485
00:29:47.791 --> 00:29:50.831
But to pack it in a little box
that was easily accessible,


486
00:29:50.911 --> 00:29:54.511
that was easily affordable by every man.

487
00:29:54.591 --> 00:29:59.431
We wanted to have a machine that was
a magnificent game-playing system


488
00:29:59.511 --> 00:30:04.071
that would run circles around any
other game system that was out there,


489
00:30:04.151 --> 00:30:05.951
and yet cost less than all of them.

490
00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:10.472
We wanted a machine that had
the graphics capabilities


491
00:30:10.552 --> 00:30:13.752
that if you look at what was available
in the marketplace at that time,


492
00:30:13.832 --> 00:30:15.632
a Silicon Graphics machine
or something like that,


493
00:30:15.712 --> 00:30:18.152
you'd pay $20,000-$30,000

494
00:30:18.232 --> 00:30:21.312
for a machine that would have
the kinds of capabilities


495
00:30:21.392 --> 00:30:25.832
that we hoped to be able to launch
to the public at less than $1,000 price.


496
00:30:25.912 --> 00:30:27.632
That was our big dream.

497
00:30:27.712 --> 00:30:32.192
We were all in this together,
we all had kind of the same vision.


498
00:30:32.272 --> 00:30:35.232
It really was more
like a mission from God,

499
00:30:35.312 --> 00:30:37.952
that we thought we
needed to bring this out

500
00:30:38.032 --> 00:30:40.672
for everyone to be able
to experience and use.


501
00:30:40.872 --> 00:30:43.152
And it had a friendly name, 
Amiga, that...

502
00:30:43.232 --> 00:30:45.152
Who could not love such a name?

503
00:30:46.072 --> 00:30:50.032
When I joined Amiga,
and saw the diagram on the wall


504
00:30:50.112 --> 00:30:53.552
of the chip architecture
and the system architecture,


505
00:30:54.672 --> 00:30:57.552
one of the things about it is,
to implement that, normally,


506
00:30:57.632 --> 00:31:00.632
would require a lot of
different small chips.


507
00:31:00.712 --> 00:31:02.552
And it would be a very complex system,

508
00:31:02.632 --> 00:31:05.352
and take a lot of
power and be very large.

509
00:31:05.952 --> 00:31:09.472
But what was happening at
that time in chip technology


510
00:31:09.552 --> 00:31:12.072
was very large-scale integration, VLSI.

511
00:31:12.152 --> 00:31:14.272
And making custom chips,

512
00:31:14.352 --> 00:31:19.192
and that's something that Jay Miner
had a lot of experience with at Atari,


513
00:31:19.272 --> 00:31:20.952
in creating the Atari products.

514
00:31:21.032 --> 00:31:25.432
So, seeing that architecture and knowing
that those chips were really a possibility,


515
00:31:25.512 --> 00:31:27.752
and that they could be made
at an affordable type of price


516
00:31:27.832 --> 00:31:29.672
that would work in a home computer

517
00:31:29.752 --> 00:31:31.712
was a huge breakthrough.

518
00:31:31.792 --> 00:31:35.792
The chips, Portia, 
Agnus and Daphne,

519
00:31:35.872 --> 00:31:37.552
which were their original names,

520
00:31:37.632 --> 00:31:39.912
Agnus was the main DMA engine.

521
00:31:39.992 --> 00:31:43.432
It was an address generator, AG,
so that's where we got Agnus.


522
00:31:43.512 --> 00:31:47.232
And it was really the DMA engine
for everything.


523
00:31:47.912 --> 00:31:50.912
Daphne was fed by Agnus,

524
00:31:50.992 --> 00:31:54.599
and was given all the display
stuff to generate the displays,


525
00:31:54.624 --> 00:31:56.136
generate the sprites,

526
00:31:56.192 --> 00:31:58.952
and do some of my stuff.

527
00:31:59.512 --> 00:32:04.512
Portia, the port chip and the audio chip,
was also fed by Agnus.


528
00:32:04.592 --> 00:32:08.072
So Agnus had all this huge amounts
of DMA pointers in it.


529
00:32:08.152 --> 00:32:11.232
And it basically pulled stuff out of memory

530
00:32:11.312 --> 00:32:14.072
and put stuff in memory
and then fed the other two chips


531
00:32:14.152 --> 00:32:19.072
to do other things like the audio,
the floppy disk IO, the display,


532
00:32:19.152 --> 00:32:22.352
and then Agnus also did, internally
though, it did the blitter operation.


533
00:32:22.432 --> 00:32:23.672
So it did the graphics.

534
00:32:23.752 --> 00:32:27.152
And based on that
and how well that was tightly integrated


535
00:32:27.232 --> 00:32:32.312
with the 68000 and Agnus basically
stealing cycles from the 68000...


536
00:32:32.392 --> 00:32:36.552
Cos the 68000 could only use memory
at half the speed of the RAM,


537
00:32:36.632 --> 00:32:38.832
we were able to do all these
things in the background


538
00:32:38.912 --> 00:32:41.712
without really affecting
the 68000's performance.


539
00:32:41.992 --> 00:32:45.912
The way those chips worked is they
all got their little moment in time


540
00:32:45.992 --> 00:32:48.752
to get on the memory bus
to talk to the main CPU


541
00:32:48.832 --> 00:32:51.632
or to talk to
each other on that bus.

542
00:32:51.712 --> 00:32:56.232
And there were actually 25
different slices of time in that.


543
00:32:56.312 --> 00:32:58.312
We called it 25 DMA channels.

544
00:32:58.392 --> 00:33:02.352
So organising and orchestrating all
of that was a major accomplishment.


545
00:33:02.472 --> 00:33:05.512
You had audio bits being DMA-ed,

546
00:33:05.592 --> 00:33:07.832
and you had video
bits being DMA-ed,


547
00:33:07.912 --> 00:33:10.952
and you the blitter
moving graphics around,


548
00:33:11.032 --> 00:33:14.272
you had the floppy disk
DMA stuff going on.


549
00:33:14.352 --> 00:33:18.192
In order to effectively get all those
things moving around properly,


550
00:33:18.272 --> 00:33:21.312
all at the same time, you have to
have pre-emptive multitasking.


551
00:33:21.392 --> 00:33:25.192
Because you can't be pulling stuff
to wait for something to do.


552
00:33:25.272 --> 00:33:26.992
You have to be event-driven,

553
00:33:27.072 --> 00:33:29.472
so that when things
need to be restarted


554
00:33:29.552 --> 00:33:32.632
or things are done and you need
to start something else up,


555
00:33:32.712 --> 00:33:34.312
it all has to be pre-emptive.

556
00:33:34.392 --> 00:33:35.912
Yeah, so back then,

557
00:33:35.992 --> 00:33:39.912
most computers, micro-computers,
were single-tasking computers,


558
00:33:39.992 --> 00:33:42.392
you ran one application
at a time.


559
00:33:42.472 --> 00:33:45.072
You did what you wanted, you
shut down that application,


560
00:33:45.152 --> 00:33:46.672
and then you ran something else.

561
00:33:46.752 --> 00:33:49.032
So you could only run
one program at a time.


562
00:33:49.112 --> 00:33:51.032
The idea of a multi-tasking
operating system


563
00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:55.312
is to allow several different processes
to run in parallel at the same time,


564
00:33:55.392 --> 00:33:58.552
and to share the CPU between
the different processes,


565
00:33:58.632 --> 00:34:00.392
and to do that fast enough

566
00:34:00.472 --> 00:34:02.512
that you don't notice that
it's switching between them.


567
00:34:02.592 --> 00:34:07.712
The 68000 chip only had a
few of the features needed


568
00:34:07.792 --> 00:34:10.232
to properly do what a full

569
00:34:10.312 --> 00:34:13.432
multi-tasking operating
system does nowadays.


570
00:34:13.512 --> 00:34:17.312
And so we were only thinking
of doing the best we could


571
00:34:17.392 --> 00:34:20.284
to let the software team take
it beyond what the basic,


572
00:34:20.309 --> 00:34:21.856
simple hardware could do.

573
00:34:21.912 --> 00:34:25.192
Yeah, multi-tasking was
more difficult to implement


574
00:34:25.272 --> 00:34:26.832
on a machine like the Amiga.

575
00:34:26.912 --> 00:34:29.952
That was the early days
of microprocessors.


576
00:34:30.032 --> 00:34:35.832
And they didn't have the concept of
protecting different process spaces.


577
00:34:35.912 --> 00:34:40.232
So it was easy for one process to overrun
the memory into another process.


578
00:34:40.632 --> 00:34:43.392
So, the design of the multi-tasking
had to be very careful


579
00:34:43.472 --> 00:34:46.632
to try to avoid those types
of situations from happening.


580
00:34:46.712 --> 00:34:50.352
Well, when I came into the project,
I started in August of '83,


581
00:34:50.432 --> 00:34:54.632
there was no hardware, there wasn't
even a board with a 68000 on it.


582
00:34:54.712 --> 00:34:58.433
There was just... We had an
Atari 800 that we could use


583
00:34:58.513 --> 00:35:00.273
and we had a SAGE computer...

584
00:35:00.353 --> 00:35:03.913
That was a fancy
multi-user computer,


585
00:35:03.993 --> 00:35:08.033
designed to handle up to
four users at the same time.


586
00:35:08.113 --> 00:35:11.313
And we had 10 users jammed
on that tiny little box,


587
00:35:11.393 --> 00:35:15.153
all hammering at that one CPU,
trying to get it to do our work.


588
00:35:15.473 --> 00:35:20.753
Right around October, I think,
we had our first 68000 prototype


589
00:35:20.833 --> 00:35:24.993
which was just a 68000 with some
RAM on it, and a serial port.


590
00:35:25.553 --> 00:35:30.073
There was no fancy hardware at that
time, but it did allow us to...


591
00:35:30.153 --> 00:35:34.593
It allowed Carl to bring up his
pre-emptive multi-tasking kernel.


592
00:35:34.673 --> 00:35:37.713
It allowed me to get
graphics basically running


593
00:35:37.793 --> 00:35:40.913
with a little emulator for
some of the graphics.


594
00:35:40.993 --> 00:35:45.673
The architecture of the system
let the different developers


595
00:35:45.753 --> 00:35:48.233
develop their components,
their libraries,


596
00:35:48.313 --> 00:35:49.953
independent of each other,

597
00:35:50.033 --> 00:35:53.113
and actually load them into
the system independently,


598
00:35:53.193 --> 00:35:55.873
and allow them to test
without having to coordinate


599
00:35:55.953 --> 00:35:58.113
in a real serious way
with everyone else.


600
00:35:58.193 --> 00:36:00.353
I don't believe we
got real hardware,


601
00:36:00.433 --> 00:36:03.273
where they were plugging the
wire-wrapped bread boards in,


602
00:36:03.353 --> 00:36:06.473
until basically about
a month before CES.


603
00:36:06.833 --> 00:36:10.793
We had one bread board to
represent the computer,


604
00:36:10.873 --> 00:36:15.753
the 68000, the memory, and
it had some connectors on it


605
00:36:15.833 --> 00:36:18.593
to represent the sockets where
the three custom chips would go.


606
00:36:18.833 --> 00:36:24.273
Three 40-pin sockets to plug the umbilical
cords that went from the chip stacks,


607
00:36:24.353 --> 00:36:30.993
which were between five and seven
sets of boards with high-speed CMOS


608
00:36:31.113 --> 00:36:34.353
that emulated the functions
of the hardware.


609
00:36:34.433 --> 00:36:37.833
And each one of those would plug
into a different 40-pin socket


610
00:36:37.913 --> 00:36:39.793
on what we called then the
Lorraine motherboard.


611
00:36:39.873 --> 00:36:43.313
But it was a very
primitive way to mimic


612
00:36:43.393 --> 00:36:46.153
something that's going to be
turned into an integrated circuit.


613
00:36:46.233 --> 00:36:51.033
But there was no prototyping technology
at that time to quickly make a chip.


614
00:36:51.113 --> 00:36:56.233
You had to do this preliminary step and
work out all the details and the bugs.


615
00:36:56.313 --> 00:36:59.633
Then I finally was able to like...
Well, let me pull the emulator out,


616
00:36:59.713 --> 00:37:03.193
and plug in writing these
registers to the hardware


617
00:37:03.313 --> 00:37:04.873
and see if anything happened.

618
00:37:04.953 --> 00:37:08.113
And after three weeks to four
weeks of concentrated work,


619
00:37:08.193 --> 00:37:12.833
in the last week before CES, we
basically moved into the office.


620
00:37:12.913 --> 00:37:18.033
So it was quite an amazing time period
when we're all pushing each other


621
00:37:18.113 --> 00:37:19.793
to try to get more stuff done,

622
00:37:19.873 --> 00:37:22.753
and trying to help each other
to get that stuff done.


623
00:37:26.593 --> 00:37:30.593
The build-up to the CES shows
was actually insanity.


624
00:37:31.433 --> 00:37:34.913
It was not a nice smooth, kind of,
"OK, we're going to go to CES."


625
00:37:34.993 --> 00:37:36.793
It was like, "Oh, my God!

626
00:37:36.873 --> 00:37:39.593
"We've got to make
this work for CES."


627
00:37:39.673 --> 00:37:42.513
As we came up to that CES show,

628
00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:46.553
I was already part of the
higher-level discussions


629
00:37:46.633 --> 00:37:48.353
that were taking place
in the company.


630
00:37:50.233 --> 00:37:52.073
And so, unfortunately for me,

631
00:37:52.153 --> 00:37:55.113
I knew a lot more than other
people in the company knew,


632
00:37:55.193 --> 00:37:58.833
and I had a clear sense of
just how bad things were,


633
00:37:58.913 --> 00:38:00.913
how close we were to
the edge, financially.


634
00:38:01.313 --> 00:38:02.833
We were out of money.

635
00:38:02.913 --> 00:38:04.753
And it was difficult
to find money.


636
00:38:04.993 --> 00:38:07.473
Jay mortgaged his house.

637
00:38:07.553 --> 00:38:10.793
Dave sold at least one car. He
had some fancy, expensive cars.


638
00:38:10.873 --> 00:38:15.993
So, I was very aware of the
emptiness of the wallet.


639
00:38:16.073 --> 00:38:18.473
The CES show was kind of
a make-or-break thing.


640
00:38:18.553 --> 00:38:20.953
If we didn't make it to CES,

641
00:38:21.553 --> 00:38:23.273
it was gonna hurt.

642
00:38:23.353 --> 00:38:24.833
We had to show something.

643
00:38:24.913 --> 00:38:27.993
We had to show something
to people to impress them,


644
00:38:28.073 --> 00:38:33.193
to either get additional funding, or to
figure out a way to sell the product.


645
00:38:33.273 --> 00:38:35.433
We knew things were bad,

646
00:38:35.713 --> 00:38:39.273
but it didn't matter.

647
00:38:39.873 --> 00:38:42.513
We were gonna do what we
were gonna do anyway.


648
00:38:42.593 --> 00:38:45.073
The machine was always breaking
down, there were always problems


649
00:38:45.153 --> 00:38:46.873
where something would go
out and all of a sudden


650
00:38:46.953 --> 00:38:48.793
the blitter would stop working,
and those types of things.


651
00:38:49.153 --> 00:38:51.433
So, it was difficult
because it was a very...


652
00:38:51.513 --> 00:38:54.393
These were these separate boards
that were very complicated,


653
00:38:54.473 --> 00:38:57.233
with lots of wires on them, lots
of things that could go wrong.


654
00:38:57.633 --> 00:39:02.553
The hardware guys are doing their best to
make sure this hardware stays working.


655
00:39:02.633 --> 00:39:04.673
Things would die,
wires would break.


656
00:39:05.073 --> 00:39:08.313
It was a giant set of wire-wrapped
boards, it was fragile.


657
00:39:08.393 --> 00:39:10.033
We were very nervous about it.

658
00:39:10.433 --> 00:39:14.633
And in addition, we were trying to add
new features up to the last minute


659
00:39:14.713 --> 00:39:18.713
to make the CES demos just
blow everyone's socks off,


660
00:39:18.793 --> 00:39:22.073
we used to say, and that was
kind of the terminology we used.


661
00:39:22.153 --> 00:39:23.713
We blew everyone's socks off.

662
00:39:23.793 --> 00:39:26.873
But how to do that always
was up to the last minute.


663
00:39:26.953 --> 00:39:30.153
So many of us ended
up staying nights,


664
00:39:30.233 --> 00:39:35.073
and working weekends to try to get as
much done as we could before the show.


665
00:39:35.593 --> 00:39:40.473
It was frightening.
It was exhilarating.


666
00:39:41.073 --> 00:39:44.914
And then, a software
guy comes in


667
00:39:44.994 --> 00:39:48.474
and wants me to make a major
change to the hardware,


668
00:39:48.554 --> 00:39:50.834
a few weeks before CES,

669
00:39:50.914 --> 00:39:53.434
to put in a feature
for the graphics.


670
00:39:53.514 --> 00:39:55.074
And I'm flabbergasted.

671
00:39:55.154 --> 00:39:58.154
It is just, "No way.
Are you kidding?


672
00:39:58.234 --> 00:40:00.097
"We're not gonna make
that kind of change.


673
00:40:00.122 --> 00:40:01.378
We can't take that risk.

674
00:40:01.434 --> 00:40:03.634
"This is the whole company.

675
00:40:03.714 --> 00:40:07.914
"We mess this up and we have no
hardware, we are in big trouble."


676
00:40:08.114 --> 00:40:10.474
The hardware feature that
he wanted was line draw.


677
00:40:10.554 --> 00:40:12.494
Other, more expensive graphics computers,

678
00:40:12.519 --> 00:40:14.458
already had kind of a hardware line draw,

679
00:40:14.514 --> 00:40:17.874
but this was the first
time that a blitter


680
00:40:17.954 --> 00:40:20.714
was basically perverted into
being able to draw lines.


681
00:40:20.994 --> 00:40:24.794
It was a great idea,
but there was no time.


682
00:40:24.874 --> 00:40:26.714
And there was no schedule.

683
00:40:26.794 --> 00:40:30.074
And I wasn't going to allow it.
No way, no how.


684
00:40:30.154 --> 00:40:32.554
Bob Pariseau, the guy
in charge of software,


685
00:40:32.634 --> 00:40:36.354
is trying to convince me to do
this, because it's very important.


686
00:40:36.434 --> 00:40:38.714
And I absolutely will not do it.

687
00:40:38.794 --> 00:40:43.554
He grabs my arm, and in a joking
way, starts twisting my arm.


688
00:40:43.634 --> 00:40:45.634
"I'm twisting your arm,
you're gonna do this."


689
00:40:46.154 --> 00:40:49.114
The dog, Mitchie, Jay's dog,

690
00:40:49.514 --> 00:40:52.434
leaps to my defence,
and I can't help it.


691
00:40:52.514 --> 00:40:54.714
The dog jumped to my defence.

692
00:40:54.794 --> 00:40:56.074
Of course I'll put it in.

693
00:40:56.554 --> 00:40:59.474
And we took the risk, and we
took apart the wire wraps,


694
00:40:59.554 --> 00:41:03.274
and we made the changes, and we
made it to CES with line draw,


695
00:41:03.754 --> 00:41:07.754
one of the most astonishing things
to see in a machine of that time.


696
00:41:07.834 --> 00:41:08.954
Thank you, dog.

697
00:41:09.034 --> 00:41:13.674
When it was finally time to pack up the
office and take everything to the show,


698
00:41:13.754 --> 00:41:17.394
some of us were still working on
our code, and they had to, like,


699
00:41:17.474 --> 00:41:20.794
you know, have our computers plugged
into extension cords so we could


700
00:41:20.874 --> 00:41:23.834
walk out to the parking lot with
the computer and keep working


701
00:41:23.914 --> 00:41:26.714
right until they had to unplug
it and put it in the van.


702
00:41:26.794 --> 00:41:28.674
Because it was like that.

703
00:41:28.754 --> 00:41:30.634
The changes were happening
all the way up to


704
00:41:31.114 --> 00:41:35.074
when those boards were being taken and
put into aeroplane seats on aeroplanes


705
00:41:35.154 --> 00:41:36.634
and flown down to Las Vegas.

706
00:41:36.714 --> 00:41:40.234
It was chaos. There was nothing
smooth about that whole process.


707
00:41:48.794 --> 00:41:52.954
Everyone's hopes and
dreams were pinned to


708
00:41:53.034 --> 00:41:56.794
that moment when the
CES show opened,


709
00:41:57.674 --> 00:42:00.434
and the first people would
start to see our baby,


710
00:42:00.514 --> 00:42:02.394
and what kind of
response would it get.


711
00:42:02.474 --> 00:42:06.154
They had a booth there, all this Amiga
stuff that had been done before,


712
00:42:06.234 --> 00:42:09.634
like the Amiga joysticks, the Power
Sticks, some of the Amiga games


713
00:42:09.714 --> 00:42:14.114
that were actually designed to establish
the company as a real company.


714
00:42:14.194 --> 00:42:17.914
When the people finally got
a chance to see our baby,


715
00:42:17.994 --> 00:42:20.314
the response was overwhelming.

716
00:42:20.394 --> 00:42:22.434
It was astonishing.

717
00:42:22.514 --> 00:42:24.794
Every party that came in there,

718
00:42:24.874 --> 00:42:28.594
every major corporation that got
a chance to see the device,


719
00:42:28.674 --> 00:42:33.314
they were astonished at the magnificence
of the thing they had just seen.


720
00:42:33.394 --> 00:42:37.434
That was the great endorsement
that we were on the right track.


721
00:42:37.514 --> 00:42:39.874
We were knocking people's
socks off with this thing.


722
00:42:40.154 --> 00:42:46.274
And that night, then, the Amiga
executives said to the rest of staff


723
00:42:46.354 --> 00:42:48.034
they were so pleased
with everything.


724
00:42:48.114 --> 00:42:51.514
They took us out to dinner. We
had this awesome Italian dinner.


725
00:42:51.594 --> 00:42:52.874
Drank a lot of Chianti.

726
00:42:53.594 --> 00:42:56.994
And all through the meal, Dale and
RJ are over here at the side,


727
00:42:57.074 --> 00:43:00.034
and they're conversing between
themselves, and they're laughing,


728
00:43:00.114 --> 00:43:02.994
and they're having the
best possible time.


729
00:43:03.074 --> 00:43:06.114
And so we get done and he's saying,
"OK, we're gonna take the van,


730
00:43:06.194 --> 00:43:07.714
"and we're gonna go
back over to the show."


731
00:43:07.794 --> 00:43:09.234
And I said, "You're not
gonna be able to get in."


732
00:43:09.314 --> 00:43:11.114
I said, "They lock that
place up tight as a drum."


733
00:43:11.194 --> 00:43:12.554
They said, "Don't worry."

734
00:43:12.914 --> 00:43:16.794
Dale and I and that one
six-pack of warm beer.


735
00:43:18.274 --> 00:43:20.194
We went back to the trade show,

736
00:43:20.274 --> 00:43:22.994
and worked until we passed out.

737
00:43:23.314 --> 00:43:27.074
Because the demo
already existed,


738
00:43:27.154 --> 00:43:28.514
we made it better.

739
00:43:28.594 --> 00:43:33.714
The demo started as a yellow
and blue spinning ball


740
00:43:33.794 --> 00:43:38.194
that Sam Dicker wrote, that filled
the screen, and it was a great demo,


741
00:43:38.274 --> 00:43:42.154
and that was one of the canned demos
that we had for the show at CES.


742
00:43:42.234 --> 00:43:46.394
Prior to that, I had started working
on a modification of that demo,


743
00:43:46.474 --> 00:43:50.594
which was to basically shrink
it down to a small ball,


744
00:43:50.674 --> 00:43:51.834
which I called a Quickie.

745
00:43:51.914 --> 00:43:55.274
Using a play field, I could
make it bounce up and down.


746
00:43:55.354 --> 00:43:59.514
Having a background in physics,
I knew the simple algorithms


747
00:43:59.594 --> 00:44:02.274
to make something look like
it's bouncing up and down.


748
00:44:02.354 --> 00:44:06.914
And also knowing exactly how the play
field worked with a colour palette,


749
00:44:06.994 --> 00:44:11.274
I knew that I could put a trick in there
to make it look like there was a shadow,


750
00:44:11.354 --> 00:44:14.114
and that the ball would
actually cast a shadow.


751
00:44:14.674 --> 00:44:17.354
So I programmed that in there,

752
00:44:19.234 --> 00:44:22.874
and it was just a basic,
simple bouncing ball


753
00:44:22.954 --> 00:44:26.794
casting a shadow on a
simple grid in the back.


754
00:44:27.474 --> 00:44:31.754
What happened was that we
managed to fall asleep.


755
00:44:31.834 --> 00:44:34.515
I think I fell asleep first
and Dale went second.


756
00:44:34.595 --> 00:44:39.235
But the last thing that he did
was he had created a build,


757
00:44:39.315 --> 00:44:41.195
run it on the hardware,

758
00:44:41.275 --> 00:44:46.115
and then worked on the software a little
bit more to make one more change,


759
00:44:46.195 --> 00:44:50.035
and then while he was waiting for
that one more change to compile,


760
00:44:50.115 --> 00:44:51.715
he fell asleep.

761
00:44:51.795 --> 00:44:55.835
But what happened was then that the
two of us were in that room sleeping


762
00:44:55.915 --> 00:44:58.235
when our co-workers showed
up the next morning


763
00:44:58.315 --> 00:45:01.875
to clean up the booth and get ready
for the next day of the show.


764
00:45:01.955 --> 00:45:06.475
Both RJ and I are sleeping on the floor
cos we were there all night long,


765
00:45:07.515 --> 00:45:12.995
and I had left the bouncing ball that
we had just created that last night


766
00:45:13.075 --> 00:45:14.715
bouncing on the screen.

767
00:45:14.795 --> 00:45:18.155
The next morning we came in, and we
all looked at each other and said,


768
00:45:18.235 --> 00:45:20.395
"What the hell did those
two guys do last night?"


769
00:45:20.475 --> 00:45:24.555
When they came in, they clearly
recognised what was different,


770
00:45:24.635 --> 00:45:26.795
but no one knew that we were
in the next room sleeping,


771
00:45:26.875 --> 00:45:30.715
because we were in a room separate
from the main computer hardware room.


772
00:45:30.795 --> 00:45:34.915
We had to be in this little side
room where we had passed out.


773
00:45:34.995 --> 00:45:37.275
And so they didn't even know we were
in there for about half an hour,


774
00:45:37.355 --> 00:45:38.515
until someone stumbled upon us

775
00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.819
cos they were looking for a
place to put their coats.


776
00:45:40.875 --> 00:45:44.875
And they find the two
of us asleep in there.


777
00:45:46.515 --> 00:45:49.515
The show was only gonna
go on for one more day.


778
00:45:49.595 --> 00:45:53.955
Gary McCoy and Don Reisinger, they'd
already brought a lot of people by


779
00:45:54.035 --> 00:45:57.315
to show off the capabilities
of the Amiga computer.


780
00:45:57.395 --> 00:46:01.315
This was all behind curtains. It wasn't
open to anybody to just walk in.


781
00:46:01.395 --> 00:46:02.635
You had to be invited in.

782
00:46:02.715 --> 00:46:06.835
So it was like Sears and all these
other companies that were invited in.


783
00:46:06.915 --> 00:46:11.235
They had already seen this stuff, and
they all immediately went out and got,


784
00:46:11.315 --> 00:46:13.995
I think, just about every person
that they had already brought in,


785
00:46:14.075 --> 00:46:16.835
they brought them back
to see that demo.


786
00:46:22.635 --> 00:46:27.195
You could not believe the number of
people that wanted to get in to see


787
00:46:27.275 --> 00:46:29.915
what the hell was going
on inside that compound.


788
00:46:30.315 --> 00:46:31.795
I thought it was incredible.

789
00:46:32.595 --> 00:46:35.315
That was the most amazing thing.

790
00:46:35.595 --> 00:46:40.555
Yeah, real-time graphics was
amazing to do in those days.


791
00:46:41.235 --> 00:46:45.195
Now, of course, it's very commonplace,
but that was something special.


792
00:46:45.315 --> 00:46:48.155
It reminded me of the statement
from Samuel F.B. Morse,


793
00:46:48.235 --> 00:46:50.155
when he did the first telegraph.

794
00:46:50.235 --> 00:46:51.755
"What hath God wrought?"

795
00:46:51.835 --> 00:46:53.435
That's the first thing
that came to mind, is,


796
00:46:53.515 --> 00:46:55.675
"What in the hell have we
done here to this industry?"


797
00:47:04.555 --> 00:47:07.275
There was a lot of buzz
in the marketplace,


798
00:47:07.355 --> 00:47:09.659
and even Steve Jobs had heard the buzz

799
00:47:09.684 --> 00:47:12.459
and came over a couple of different times.

800
00:47:12.715 --> 00:47:18.355
After he visited, we were convinced
it was strictly a fishing expedition,


801
00:47:18.435 --> 00:47:21.355
to see what it was he
might be up against.


802
00:47:21.435 --> 00:47:25.355
We were constantly giving demos to
potential investors, or partners,


803
00:47:25.435 --> 00:47:27.755
or someone that could
bring in some cash.


804
00:47:27.835 --> 00:47:31.435
We had a number of the most
prominent venture capital people


805
00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:33.875
in the tech business
come and visit.


806
00:47:33.955 --> 00:47:36.395
They loved what we had,

807
00:47:36.475 --> 00:47:39.075
but in the final analysis,

808
00:47:39.155 --> 00:47:43.395
they figured it was gonna take a whole lot
of money to get this thing to the market,


809
00:47:43.475 --> 00:47:46.715
and they weren't willing to
go up against IBM and Apple.


810
00:47:47.155 --> 00:47:51.115
We were pretty nervous that if we
didn't get an influx of cash soon,


811
00:47:51.195 --> 00:47:54.875
or if the company
wasn't purchased soon,


812
00:47:54.955 --> 00:47:58.395
that we'd all be out of a job and that
dream would have just fallen apart.


813
00:47:58.475 --> 00:48:00.708
When Amiga started running out of money,

814
00:48:00.733 --> 00:48:03.019
Dave Morse had to start looking for some.

815
00:48:03.635 --> 00:48:05.777
And he ended up going back to Atari,

816
00:48:05.802 --> 00:48:08.579
where Jay Miner actually had some contacts.

817
00:48:09.075 --> 00:48:14.435
So, they made a deal that Atari would
lend them $500,000 to keep going.


818
00:48:14.515 --> 00:48:17.555
They would use that money
to actually make chips


819
00:48:17.635 --> 00:48:20.315
of the prototype chips that
they had previously made.


820
00:48:20.395 --> 00:48:25.235
If they didn't pay back that
loan by June 30th, 1984,


821
00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:28.235
it meant that Atari would get
that technology for nothing.


822
00:48:28.555 --> 00:48:32.195
The deal was made, and it was a
bit of a deal with the devil.


823
00:48:32.275 --> 00:48:36.635
There was that point in time when we
were going to have to produce or,


824
00:48:36.755 --> 00:48:40.675
you know, we were gonna end up being
part of Atari one way or the other.


825
00:48:40.795 --> 00:48:44.955
They didn't think it was a smart deal.
Jay Miner knew it wasn't a smart deal.


826
00:48:45.035 --> 00:48:46.668
But they really had no
options at that time,


827
00:48:46.693 --> 00:48:48.179
cos they were just
running out of money.


828
00:48:48.395 --> 00:48:49.675
But that deal was made
with Warner Brothers,


829
00:48:52.235 --> 00:48:56.035
and between that time and the time
that Commodore came into the picture,


830
00:48:56.115 --> 00:48:58.795
Warner Brothers sold the
whole thing to the Tramiels.


831
00:48:59.315 --> 00:49:01.915
Warner Communications' sale
of its Atari home computers


832
00:49:01.995 --> 00:49:04.795
may eliminate a big financial
headache for that company,


833
00:49:04.875 --> 00:49:08.515
but the sale, for $240 million
in notes to Jack Tramiel,


834
00:49:08.595 --> 00:49:10.315
who once headed
Commodore computers,


835
00:49:10.395 --> 00:49:12.515
could cause headaches for
a lot of other companies.


836
00:49:12.595 --> 00:49:15.835
Here's our clear-headed business
reporter, Barron's Editor Alan Abelson.


837
00:49:15.915 --> 00:49:17.155
- Good morning, Alan.
- Good morning.


838
00:49:17.235 --> 00:49:20.236
Well, you know, that kind of deal,
Bob, was a Henny Youngman deal.


839
00:49:20.316 --> 00:49:21.356
What does that mean?

840
00:49:21.436 --> 00:49:24.676
Well, that means that Warner said to
them, "Here, take my company, please."


841
00:49:24.756 --> 00:49:27.276
The fact is that Tramiel
almost got it for nothing.


842
00:49:27.396 --> 00:49:30.156
The terms were
extraordinarily easy.


843
00:49:30.236 --> 00:49:32.916
And, you know, Tramiel's a
guy who takes no prisoners.


844
00:49:32.996 --> 00:49:34.836
So this ought to
be quite a fight.


845
00:49:34.916 --> 00:49:37.836
A real grudge battle between
Commodore and Atari.


846
00:49:37.916 --> 00:49:41.596
So Jack Tramiel, when I knew him,
he was president of Commodore.


847
00:49:41.676 --> 00:49:45.276
He had a reputation.
His history was that


848
00:49:45.356 --> 00:49:49.556
he was in a concentration camp
in Germany in World War II.


849
00:49:49.636 --> 00:49:52.916
And he came out of that with
kind of a certain attitude.


850
00:49:52.996 --> 00:49:55.956
His attitude is
"business is hell."


851
00:49:56.036 --> 00:49:59.196
And if you get in his way,
he will send you there.


852
00:49:59.276 --> 00:50:02.556
You don't want to be in a
negotiation with a man


853
00:50:02.636 --> 00:50:06.076
who firmly believes
that business is war,


854
00:50:06.156 --> 00:50:08.716
and all he has to do is figure
out how to bring you down.


855
00:50:08.796 --> 00:50:10.916
He would be the guy you
want on your side.


856
00:50:11.796 --> 00:50:14.236
But you still wouldn't
necessarily trust him.


857
00:50:14.756 --> 00:50:18.076
Sometimes in a really intense meeting if
he wanted to show you how fierce he was


858
00:50:18.156 --> 00:50:21.476
and how strong he was, and how
much of a survivor he was,


859
00:50:21.556 --> 00:50:23.596
he would pull up his
shirt and show you


860
00:50:23.676 --> 00:50:27.236
the serial number that
had been tattooed on him


861
00:50:27.476 --> 00:50:29.636
when he was in a
concentration camp.


862
00:50:29.756 --> 00:50:31.838
The man was an extremely intense man

863
00:50:31.863 --> 00:50:34.620
and his family picked
up on that whole vibe.


864
00:50:34.676 --> 00:50:37.356
Are you prepared to tell
us why you left Commodore?


865
00:50:37.436 --> 00:50:39.396
The chairman of the
company, and myself,


866
00:50:39.476 --> 00:50:42.716
have disagreed on the
basic principles


867
00:50:42.796 --> 00:50:44.796
of how to run the company.

868
00:50:45.876 --> 00:50:49.716
And I felt if I cannot go
into my office smiling


869
00:50:50.396 --> 00:50:52.076
and being happy, 
I better quit.

870
00:50:52.156 --> 00:50:54.196
Commodore was a huge
business at the time.


871
00:50:54.676 --> 00:50:57.436
Irving Gould and Jack
Tramiel built that company


872
00:50:57.516 --> 00:51:00.596
to being a powerhouse in
home personal computing.


873
00:51:01.516 --> 00:51:04.236
When Jack went to Atari, it
was a good move for him.


874
00:51:04.316 --> 00:51:07.836
He was going to try to duplicate
the Commodore business model.


875
00:51:07.916 --> 00:51:10.196
He was going to try to
turn everything around.


876
00:51:10.276 --> 00:51:11.996
He knew what he had to do.

877
00:51:12.076 --> 00:51:15.956
And Irving Gould, who was
chairman of Commodore,


878
00:51:16.036 --> 00:51:19.796
was uncertain as to how powerful
and how successful Jack could be.


879
00:51:20.036 --> 00:51:22.836
As they started to approach
the June 30th deadline,


880
00:51:22.916 --> 00:51:26.516
they didn't want to just give
up that technology to Atari


881
00:51:26.596 --> 00:51:30.116
and they needed to be able
to pay back that loan


882
00:51:30.196 --> 00:51:31.756
in order to get that
off their back.


883
00:51:32.076 --> 00:51:34.236
That half-million dollars
that came in from Atari


884
00:51:34.316 --> 00:51:38.956
really did kind of get us a breath
of air for a short period of time.


885
00:51:39.036 --> 00:51:43.156
But Jack Tramiel from
Commodore had moved to Atari


886
00:51:43.236 --> 00:51:47.396
and then this was the idea of
going to work for Jack Tramiel,


887
00:51:47.476 --> 00:51:51.716
which all of us were quite nervous
about and didn't like that idea.


888
00:51:51.956 --> 00:51:55.796
It felt to us that as the
negotiations were progressing,


889
00:51:55.876 --> 00:51:58.396
they wanted more and more.

890
00:51:58.476 --> 00:51:59.851
And if it got to the point

891
00:51:59.876 --> 00:52:03.260
where we were putting them in
business to compete with us,


892
00:52:03.316 --> 00:52:05.596
that wouldn't have
made any sense to us.


893
00:52:05.676 --> 00:52:09.316
And we kept telling them that,
but we couldn't budge them.


894
00:52:09.396 --> 00:52:12.156
The Atari guys knew that we were
getting more and more desperate,


895
00:52:12.236 --> 00:52:15.036
that we're almost out of money,
that time was almost up,


896
00:52:15.116 --> 00:52:18.036
and they knew they
had us over a barrel


897
00:52:18.116 --> 00:52:19.876
and they believed
that it was too late,


898
00:52:19.956 --> 00:52:23.796
that we couldn't find
another partner to go with


899
00:52:23.876 --> 00:52:26.996
and that Atari acquisition
was the only hope for Amiga.


900
00:52:27.596 --> 00:52:29.436
Part of the deal that
we made with Atari


901
00:52:29.516 --> 00:52:32.796
was they would get the
detailed silicon drawings


902
00:52:32.876 --> 00:52:35.236
of how to make the
three custom chips.


903
00:52:35.316 --> 00:52:39.316
There was some things that we did
to protect ourselves against Atari.


904
00:52:39.796 --> 00:52:43.116
The set of drawings we
gave them were modified.


905
00:52:43.196 --> 00:52:44.676
They wouldn't work.

906
00:52:45.076 --> 00:52:49.636
There was only one set
of correct drawings,


907
00:52:49.716 --> 00:52:53.916
and they were saved in a dusty old
attach√© case here in this house.


908
00:52:53.996 --> 00:52:57.276
They only wanted the hardware, and
they weren't interested in the people.


909
00:52:57.356 --> 00:53:01.356
The just wanted the tool as a
weapon to point at Commodore


910
00:53:01.436 --> 00:53:03.716
and try to sink the
ship of Commodore.


911
00:53:09.156 --> 00:53:12.036
Somehow Dave got in
contact with Commodore.


912
00:53:12.116 --> 00:53:16.116
Dave and I had agreed to some
parameters of what was acceptable


913
00:53:16.196 --> 00:53:21.876
in terms of a price for the company,
and Dave went ahead and did a deal.


914
00:53:21.956 --> 00:53:24.556
Dave was very, very
pragmatic about this.


915
00:53:24.796 --> 00:53:26.876
And I think for him
the thing was,


916
00:53:27.236 --> 00:53:29.676
even though we can finish this,

917
00:53:29.916 --> 00:53:33.956
we don't know if we're going to have
the marketing horsepower to market it


918
00:53:34.116 --> 00:53:37.196
and that Commodore is
a better bet for that


919
00:53:37.276 --> 00:53:39.556
because they do have the
marketing horsepower.


920
00:53:39.636 --> 00:53:42.476
They've got the distribution system,
they've got the manufacturing.


921
00:53:42.556 --> 00:53:46.556
There was a lot of animosity between
Jack Tramiel and Irving Gould.


922
00:53:46.636 --> 00:53:51.476
And Irving Gould knew that if they
bought that technology outright,


923
00:53:51.556 --> 00:53:53.796
Jack Tramiel would not be
able to use that at Atari.


924
00:53:53.996 --> 00:53:57.356
So, what he ended up doing,
instead of just buying the chips


925
00:53:57.436 --> 00:54:00.836
was he bought the whole Amiga company
for about $30 million dollars.


926
00:54:00.916 --> 00:54:05.676
And I was with Dave the day
we drove over to Atari


927
00:54:05.756 --> 00:54:10.477
and presented the guy with
a cheque for $500,000,


928
00:54:10.557 --> 00:54:13.197
which he was not
at all expecting.


929
00:54:13.277 --> 00:54:15.037
And he almost fell
off his chair.


930
00:54:15.117 --> 00:54:19.357
He had to excuse himself from the
meeting to call Jack Tramiel,


931
00:54:19.437 --> 00:54:23.437
who was in the process
of buying Atari.


932
00:54:23.517 --> 00:54:27.717
And apparently, Tramiel, not
knowing anything about this deal,


933
00:54:27.797 --> 00:54:32.797
said "When somebody gives
you a cheque for $500,000,


934
00:54:32.877 --> 00:54:34.117
"you take it."

935
00:54:34.517 --> 00:54:37.997
And so we left. He took
the cheque and we left.


936
00:54:38.077 --> 00:54:42.277
Months later, Leonard Tramiel was
looking through some documents


937
00:54:42.357 --> 00:54:45.757
and he happened to see that
there was this deal with Amiga


938
00:54:45.837 --> 00:54:47.997
that perhaps wasn't
fully honoured.


939
00:54:48.077 --> 00:54:49.397
And that's when
the lawsuit came.


940
00:54:49.757 --> 00:54:53.157
Tramiel being Tramiel sued
Commodore and sued all of us.


941
00:55:02.637 --> 00:55:06.037
The computer business is not
dead, it's alive and kicking.


942
00:55:13.117 --> 00:55:15.917
When the lawsuit from
Jack Tramiel came along


943
00:55:15.997 --> 00:55:19.597
and Atari started suing Amiga,
and Jay Miner personally,


944
00:55:19.677 --> 00:55:23.477
the judge ordered that they had to stop
work on it until things were sorted out.


945
00:55:23.557 --> 00:55:26.757
The basis of the lawsuit
seems to be that


946
00:55:26.837 --> 00:55:30.517
the only way Atari was not
to get the chip technology


947
00:55:30.597 --> 00:55:33.597
was if the chips weren't
in a working state.


948
00:55:33.677 --> 00:55:38.797
When Dave Morse came over to Atari and
paid back the $500,000 on June 30th,


949
00:55:39.157 --> 00:55:42.157
he told them that the chips
weren't working yet.


950
00:55:42.237 --> 00:55:46.877
That got Amiga off the hook about
having to deliver the chips to Atari.


951
00:55:47.237 --> 00:55:49.917
However, when Leonard
Tramiel looked at it,


952
00:55:49.997 --> 00:55:51.837
he thought it was really
suspicious because


953
00:55:51.917 --> 00:55:54.677
they actually did have the
working prototypes of the chips.


954
00:55:54.757 --> 00:55:56.837
They were demo-ing the computer

955
00:55:56.917 --> 00:55:58.800
and they subsequently
successfully


956
00:55:58.825 --> 00:56:01.461
made the chips in silicon
that were working.


957
00:56:01.517 --> 00:56:03.557
So, he thought there was
something fishy about that.


958
00:56:06.477 --> 00:56:07.877
Yes, I am very happy.

959
00:56:09.877 --> 00:56:11.757
When Jack Tramiel bought Atari,

960
00:56:12.517 --> 00:56:16.157
he started pulling in all kinds
of engineers from Commodore.


961
00:56:16.277 --> 00:56:17.906
And a lot of those engineers

962
00:56:17.931 --> 00:56:21.421
were taking Commodore
intellectual property with them.


963
00:56:21.477 --> 00:56:25.517
Irving Gould really just wanted to
slow down Jack as much as he could,


964
00:56:25.597 --> 00:56:28.117
so he did a lawsuit
against Atari first.


965
00:56:28.797 --> 00:56:33.677
Jack attacking Commodore back
is probably somewhat warranted


966
00:56:33.757 --> 00:56:35.237
the way things were going.

967
00:56:35.317 --> 00:56:38.037
So, there was a lot of
animosity between those two


968
00:56:38.117 --> 00:56:39.437
and it really showed up.

969
00:56:40.397 --> 00:56:42.877
Oh, God. There is more to
this story but, I mean,


970
00:56:42.957 --> 00:56:46.717
we spent hours
with our attorneys


971
00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:50.317
preparing for a trial.

972
00:56:51.117 --> 00:56:54.997
And I was dressed and ready
to go down to testify,


973
00:56:55.837 --> 00:56:58.957
when we were told that
Commodore had settled.


974
00:57:08.477 --> 00:57:11.037
We had been watching
Atari, and of course


975
00:57:11.117 --> 00:57:14.117
Atari had thought that they
were going to get the Amiga.


976
00:57:14.237 --> 00:57:17.757
And when they didn't get the Amiga,
it was time to find a substitute


977
00:57:17.837 --> 00:57:19.277
that could compete
with the Amiga.


978
00:57:19.357 --> 00:57:20.957
They wanted to drive the Amiga

979
00:57:21.037 --> 00:57:23.397
and drive Commodore out of business
with what they were doing.


980
00:57:23.637 --> 00:57:26.037
The Tramiel family was
nothing if not resourceful.


981
00:57:26.477 --> 00:57:29.717
So once they took over Atari and
they were trying to revive it,


982
00:57:29.797 --> 00:57:34.237
they needed a new product and it was
time to move into 16-bit technology.


983
00:57:34.317 --> 00:57:38.357
Shiraz Shivji was the
designer of the Atari STE.


984
00:57:38.437 --> 00:57:39.717
He came right from Commodore.

985
00:57:39.797 --> 00:57:41.557
They knew of our
specs pretty well,


986
00:57:41.637 --> 00:57:44.197
and so they tried to copy
that as much as they could,


987
00:57:44.277 --> 00:57:49.237
and throw together a machine
that would look as good on paper


988
00:57:49.317 --> 00:57:50.677
and try to compete with us.

989
00:57:51.557 --> 00:57:54.197
And what's the quickest thing
they could put together?


990
00:57:54.277 --> 00:57:56.717
The 68000, a lot of RAM,

991
00:57:57.517 --> 00:57:58.597
and a MIDI port.

992
00:58:01.597 --> 00:58:05.957
The Atari 520 STE has twice the
power of many business models.


993
00:58:07.517 --> 00:58:09.557
I didn't dislike the STE at all.

994
00:58:09.637 --> 00:58:11.117
I thought it was OK.

995
00:58:11.197 --> 00:58:15.717
It just didn't have anything inside
it that was exciting, really.


996
00:58:16.077 --> 00:58:20.197
Atari ST was a little bit
more purist, I suppose.


997
00:58:21.477 --> 00:58:23.597
By "purist" you can read "shit."

998
00:58:23.877 --> 00:58:29.877
The Atari ST hardware and software-wise,
was far more evolutionary.


999
00:58:31.157 --> 00:58:33.317
Kind of what you would expect
somebody to have done.


1000
00:58:33.397 --> 00:58:37.357
The ST had the same processor,
but it was slightly faster.


1001
00:58:37.837 --> 00:58:41.197
It was 8 megahertz, instead
of just over 7 megahertz.


1002
00:58:41.277 --> 00:58:46.077
The ST didn't have a blitter, so it
wasn't able to shift as many pixels.


1003
00:58:46.877 --> 00:58:51.517
The ST didn't have a Copper, but you
could kind of fake display lists,


1004
00:58:52.237 --> 00:58:54.397
of a sort. Not really.

1005
00:58:54.597 --> 00:58:56.078
It didn't have sprite hardware.

1006
00:59:00.198 --> 00:59:01.638
It can paint pictures.

1007
00:59:02.238 --> 00:59:03.558
And make them move.

1008
00:59:04.518 --> 00:59:07.958
The ST palette was rubbish.
I think it had 512 colours,


1009
00:59:08.438 --> 00:59:13.358
and they weren't
even nice colours.


1010
00:59:14.918 --> 00:59:16.238
It didn't have sprite hardware.

1011
00:59:16.918 --> 00:59:18.478
The audio hardware was rubbish.

1012
00:59:18.558 --> 00:59:20.198
Scroll and the
music will scroll.


1013
00:59:24.678 --> 00:59:27.078
OK, we're just using the Atari
right now, nothing else?


1014
00:59:27.158 --> 00:59:29.358
That's correct. The sound chip in
the Atari is playing all the music.


1015
00:59:29.438 --> 00:59:30.718
OK, we can stop
that for a second.


1016
00:59:30.798 --> 00:59:34.078
The ST didn't have the
capabilities of the Amiga,


1017
00:59:34.158 --> 00:59:36.478
and the operating system

1018
00:59:36.638 --> 00:59:39.878
because they were under
such time constraints,


1019
00:59:39.958 --> 00:59:43.038
wasn't as mature as the operating
system and the user interface


1020
00:59:43.118 --> 00:59:44.518
that the Amiga had
when it was launched.


1021
00:59:44.718 --> 00:59:47.038
Its operating system was TOS.

1022
00:59:47.918 --> 00:59:49.878
Well, that said it all to me.

1023
00:59:50.798 --> 00:59:52.878
That it was the Tramiel
Operating System.


1024
00:59:52.958 --> 00:59:55.758
When it first came out everyone
called it the "Jackintosh"


1025
00:59:55.838 --> 00:59:58.152
because it had a
nice black and white mode

1026
00:59:58.177 --> 01:00:00.222
so it could do what the Macintosh did

1027
01:00:00.278 --> 01:00:01.798
plus a little bit of colour.

1028
01:00:01.878 --> 01:00:04.318
And it did it OK.

1029
01:00:04.398 --> 01:00:07.918
You know, it didn't multi-task,
it ran GEM-DOS or TOS,


1030
01:00:07.998 --> 01:00:10.358
which was really just
repackaged GEM-DOS


1031
01:00:10.438 --> 01:00:12.638
that made it a little
more MS-DOS-like


1032
01:00:12.718 --> 01:00:15.758
so it was easy for people to write
programs for it if they knew MS-DOS.


1033
01:00:15.838 --> 01:00:19.198
But MS
-DOS was the past.

1034
01:00:19.278 --> 01:00:20.438
It wasn't moving forward.

1035
01:00:20.758 --> 01:00:22.838
The ST had two things over
the Amiga, in my opinion.


1036
01:00:22.918 --> 01:00:25.628
The first was that beautiful
little monochrome display


1037
01:00:25.653 --> 01:00:26.982
that made it look like

1038
01:00:27.038 --> 01:00:30.038
the 'Jackintosh' that it is
referred to as affectionately.


1039
01:00:30.718 --> 01:00:32.398
And the other thing that
it had over the Amiga,


1040
01:00:32.478 --> 01:00:33.998
which for me was a
stroke of genius,


1041
01:00:34.078 --> 01:00:37.918
which is what defined the ST,
were a pair of MIDI ports.


1042
01:00:37.998 --> 01:00:39.998
And as a musician
myself at the time,


1043
01:00:40.078 --> 01:00:42.678
I had an ST because
it ran Creator,


1044
01:00:43.358 --> 01:00:46.278
which of course, now is
Logic Pro on the Mac.


1045
01:00:46.558 --> 01:00:49.998
They also had a buffered MIDI port, which
is what you really needed in those days


1046
01:00:50.478 --> 01:00:53.718
and unfortunately the Amiga didn't
really have a buffered serial port so


1047
01:00:53.798 --> 01:00:56.638
our MIDI could conceivably
break down faster.


1048
01:00:56.718 --> 01:01:01.398
On the other hand, once people got
better at writing multitasking code


1049
01:01:01.478 --> 01:01:03.232
music software worked
a whole lot better


1050
01:01:03.257 --> 01:01:05.182
than it ever did when
it was single tasking.


1051
01:01:05.278 --> 01:01:09.878
The Tramiels were good at
pushing less expensive hardware


1052
01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:12.198
and the ST kind of wormed
its way into the picture.


1053
01:01:12.798 --> 01:01:16.038
My idea is always to try to
bring the best technology


1054
01:01:16.118 --> 01:01:19.238
at the lowest price
to the masses.


1055
01:01:19.318 --> 01:01:22.718
We are a company which we like to sell
to the masses, not to the classes.


1056
01:01:22.798 --> 01:01:27.958
I think the ST was a
really good example


1057
01:01:28.038 --> 01:01:30.238
of what a Commodore-like
product was.


1058
01:01:30.318 --> 01:01:34.758
It was very simple mechanically. There
was a lot of integration everywhere.


1059
01:01:34.838 --> 01:01:38.198
You can put a chip to reduce
the number of parts on it.


1060
01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:40.518
They had done a very
good job at that.


1061
01:01:40.598 --> 01:01:42.518
And it was simple
to manufacture.


1062
01:01:42.598 --> 01:01:45.758
I have to give them credit because
for the amount of time they had,


1063
01:01:45.838 --> 01:01:48.358
the few months they had to
pull the Atari ST together,


1064
01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:49.878
it actually worked pretty well.

1065
01:01:49.958 --> 01:01:52.358
It wasn't an Amiga in terms of the
total capability of the system


1066
01:01:52.438 --> 01:01:53.758
and what it was capable of,

1067
01:01:53.838 --> 01:01:56.238
but it was something that
could definitely sell


1068
01:01:56.318 --> 01:02:00.078
as an increment above the Apple
II, or above the Commodore 64.


1069
01:02:00.158 --> 01:02:02.497
We were concerned that the
Atari would take away


1070
01:02:02.522 --> 01:02:04.622
a lot of the thunder
that the Amiga had


1071
01:02:04.678 --> 01:02:07.718
and in fact, it did, because
they did beat us to market


1072
01:02:07.798 --> 01:02:09.838
and it did have a lot
of good capabilities.


1073
01:02:09.918 --> 01:02:12.398
Certainly when the
Atari hit the ground


1074
01:02:12.478 --> 01:02:16.478
it did better at some things in the
first year or two than the Amiga did


1075
01:02:16.558 --> 01:02:18.198
because of all the
stuff that was there.


1076
01:02:18.278 --> 01:02:19.838
The Amiga had a steeper
learning curve.


1077
01:02:19.918 --> 01:02:24.318
We have introduced the ST in
the United States on July 8th.


1078
01:02:24.678 --> 01:02:26.878
We are selling
everything we make.


1079
01:02:26.958 --> 01:02:30.118
It was the best launch I had in the
history of the computer business.


1080
01:02:30.198 --> 01:02:33.198
Jack Tramiel, of course, was the
boss of Commodore Computers.


1081
01:02:33.278 --> 01:02:35.438
Since his sudden and rather
startling departure,


1082
01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:37.437
Commodore, like many another big name,

1083
01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:39.822
has been beset by major
financial problems.


1084
01:02:39.878 --> 01:02:40.958
But now they are fighting back.

1085
01:02:41.038 --> 01:02:44.918
And Frank Leonardi is Vice-President
of Marketing Business Systems,


1086
01:02:44.998 --> 01:02:47.358
Commodore Business
Machines, Incorporated.


1087
01:02:47.438 --> 01:02:49.158
I was hired by Commodore

1088
01:02:49.238 --> 01:02:53.918
and they wanted to
duplicate the market-entry


1089
01:02:54.318 --> 01:02:56.878
of the new Amiga technology

1090
01:02:57.678 --> 01:03:00.798
just as the Macintosh
was done by Apple.


1091
01:03:00.878 --> 01:03:05.558
So, they brought me in to duplicate
the channel penetration,


1092
01:03:05.638 --> 01:03:08.398
the concept, the marketing,
put the team together


1093
01:03:08.478 --> 01:03:12.558
and try to see if they could go ahead
and get the Amiga out on the market.


1094
01:03:12.758 --> 01:03:15.318
When they look at the speed and
the architecture of the Amiga


1095
01:03:15.398 --> 01:03:17.506
compared to the speed and the
architecture of the Macintosh,


1096
01:03:17.531 --> 01:03:18.462
there's no comparison.

1097
01:03:18.678 --> 01:03:19.998
When they launched the Amiga,

1098
01:03:20.078 --> 01:03:23.958
Commodore marketing did a big,
splashy launch in New York.


1099
01:03:24.558 --> 01:03:28.078
They had celebrities there,
they had all kinds of press,


1100
01:03:28.158 --> 01:03:31.718
the computer press, but
also just mainstream press.


1101
01:03:32.798 --> 01:03:34.878
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen.


1102
01:03:35.558 --> 01:03:38.318
Commodore welcomes you
to Lincoln Center.


1103
01:03:38.998 --> 01:03:42.479
My name is Bob Truckenbrod, Vice
President of Marketing for Commodore,


1104
01:03:43.559 --> 01:03:45.039
and I will be your host

1105
01:03:45.119 --> 01:03:47.879
for what promises to be a
very exciting exhibition.


1106
01:03:49.759 --> 01:03:54.199
For tonight is the world
premiere of Amiga.


1107
01:03:54.319 --> 01:03:58.759
The launch of the Amiga in New
York was a wonderful experience.


1108
01:03:58.839 --> 01:04:02.999
We were so impressed that
Commodore could pull that off.


1109
01:04:03.079 --> 01:04:06.879
You know, right there at Lincoln Center,
to announce the Amiga to the world.


1110
01:04:06.959 --> 01:04:09.439
And to have all of us in tuxedos

1111
01:04:09.519 --> 01:04:12.679
and the women in beautiful
dresses and that kind of thing.


1112
01:04:12.759 --> 01:04:13.879
It really was fun.

1113
01:04:13.959 --> 01:04:18.039
I mean, to see all these dudes
dressed in black-tie, man,


1114
01:04:18.119 --> 01:04:22.519
it was just too much. Too much.

1115
01:04:22.759 --> 01:04:25.039
We did a satellite
uplink on this.


1116
01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:27.439
So this thing actually
kinda went world-wide.


1117
01:04:27.799 --> 01:04:31.639
The same time we showed that
launch from Lincoln Center


1118
01:04:31.719 --> 01:04:33.719
and anybody that
could sign on to it


1119
01:04:33.799 --> 01:04:36.999
was able to sign on and see the
launch exactly as it occurred.


1120
01:04:37.079 --> 01:04:40.239
Commodore really, you know,
they treated us very well.


1121
01:04:40.319 --> 01:04:43.439
I mean, they set all
that stuff out for us


1122
01:04:43.559 --> 01:04:45.919
and in some ways I felt like

1123
01:04:45.999 --> 01:04:49.719
some of the complaints about
Commodore were overblown


1124
01:04:49.799 --> 01:04:53.039
because they really did take the
thing and they really ran with it.


1125
01:04:53.119 --> 01:04:54.839
The sales team and
the marketing team


1126
01:04:54.919 --> 01:04:58.879
was involved only to the point of
trying to address the end use.


1127
01:04:58.959 --> 01:05:00.799
How were we going to
address the Amiga?


1128
01:05:00.879 --> 01:05:02.959
What was its main use?

1129
01:05:03.039 --> 01:05:05.799
And at that time there was
a guy named Bob Pariseau


1130
01:05:05.879 --> 01:05:07.319
who gave the presentation.

1131
01:05:07.799 --> 01:05:11.359
He was one of the engineers involved
from the original Amiga days.


1132
01:05:11.439 --> 01:05:12.839
The Amiga computer.

1133
01:05:14.359 --> 01:05:17.919
We've lived our dream, and
seen it come to life.


1134
01:05:18.919 --> 01:05:20.279
Now it's your turn.

1135
01:05:20.879 --> 01:05:23.959
What will you do with
the Amiga computer?


1136
01:05:24.239 --> 01:05:26.759
Bob basically was,
kind of the overseer


1137
01:05:27.079 --> 01:05:29.839
of a lot of the technical stuff,
particularly the software side.


1138
01:05:30.639 --> 01:05:34.999
And he did have the ability to
translate the techno side of things


1139
01:05:35.079 --> 01:05:37.799
into terms that I think most
people could really understand.


1140
01:05:37.879 --> 01:05:39.839
So when we needed a
spokesman who could,


1141
01:05:40.479 --> 01:05:42.639
if he got cornered on
a technical question,


1142
01:05:42.719 --> 01:05:46.399
could respond with a
technology-based answer


1143
01:05:46.479 --> 01:05:48.759
but he also could
make that translation


1144
01:05:48.839 --> 01:05:51.039
into terms that would be
more consumer-friendly.


1145
01:05:51.639 --> 01:05:52.999
Good evening.

1146
01:05:53.319 --> 01:05:55.439
What you are about to witness

1147
01:05:55.839 --> 01:05:59.759
is the result of an effort
of research and engineering


1148
01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:02.199
that began in 1982

1149
01:06:03.199 --> 01:06:04.759
and which, to date,

1150
01:06:04.839 --> 01:06:09.319
has consumed over 100 man-years
of engineering talent.


1151
01:06:10.359 --> 01:06:11.679
The Amiga computer.

1152
01:06:12.759 --> 01:06:15.039
What we demonstrated
at the launch


1153
01:06:15.439 --> 01:06:17.959
was just mind-blowing
for these guys.


1154
01:06:18.039 --> 01:06:21.559
When we went after that launch

1155
01:06:21.639 --> 01:06:24.399
it was to show audio, music,

1156
01:06:24.479 --> 01:06:26.759
graphics and speed.

1157
01:06:26.839 --> 01:06:28.039
And in doing that,

1158
01:06:28.119 --> 01:06:30.719
with the technology difference
of having the three chips


1159
01:06:30.839 --> 01:06:34.639
we tried to convince the world
that we had a better, faster


1160
01:06:34.719 --> 01:06:36.159
more colourful machine

1161
01:06:36.239 --> 01:06:38.639
and a distribution setup

1162
01:06:38.799 --> 01:06:40.679
that could easily
be transitioned to.


1163
01:06:40.759 --> 01:06:44.239
To show off the graphics
capabilities they got Andy Warhol


1164
01:06:44.319 --> 01:06:46.679
and Deborah Harry, who is
the singer in Blondie.


1165
01:06:46.759 --> 01:06:50.199
Andy Warhol was famous for
doing images of stars.


1166
01:06:50.279 --> 01:06:54.319
He would do a portrait of them with
very primary colour backgrounds.


1167
01:06:54.839 --> 01:06:57.199
And so they got him to do one
of those type of images,


1168
01:06:57.279 --> 01:07:00.719
where he would scan a picture
of her in and then colour it.


1169
01:07:00.799 --> 01:07:04.839
I was there for the rehearsals that
were going on with Andy Warhol.


1170
01:07:04.919 --> 01:07:08.879
And it was dicey, because the computer
was still not quite reliable.


1171
01:07:08.959 --> 01:07:13.519
And we were very concerned that it might
crash or just totally catch on fire,


1172
01:07:13.599 --> 01:07:16.839
burn up or something in the
middle of this big show


1173
01:07:16.919 --> 01:07:19.839
where we had all of this
press from New York.


1174
01:07:19.959 --> 01:07:22.919
We had this artist at
Amiga called Jack Haeger.


1175
01:07:22.999 --> 01:07:24.399
He was just a brilliant artist.

1176
01:07:24.479 --> 01:07:28.159
A lot of the early stuff that
was just awesome was Jack.


1177
01:07:28.239 --> 01:07:30.799
And Jack was also smooth
and a good talker.


1178
01:07:30.879 --> 01:07:34.479
And so, we decided he'd get
up on stage with Andy Warhol.


1179
01:07:35.039 --> 01:07:37.959
You found it to be very
spontaneous, didn't you?


1180
01:07:38.039 --> 01:07:41.079
Yeah, it's great. It's
such a great thing.


1181
01:07:45.119 --> 01:07:46.959
What more can you say?

1182
01:07:47.079 --> 01:07:48.239
Well...

1183
01:07:48.679 --> 01:07:53.279
Andy Warhol is using my
Graphicraft paint program


1184
01:07:53.399 --> 01:07:58.399
to modify a digitised image of
Deborah Harry that he just got


1185
01:07:58.479 --> 01:08:00.679
into the Amiga computer.

1186
01:08:01.079 --> 01:08:05.839
And we had rehearsed with Andy
Warhol, who was an artist.


1187
01:08:05.919 --> 01:08:08.559
He's not an engineer and
he's not a logical guy.


1188
01:08:08.639 --> 01:08:11.359
And so you can give him
logical instructions.


1189
01:08:11.479 --> 01:08:14.759
But he was an artist,
he wasn't an engineer.


1190
01:08:14.839 --> 01:08:16.959
And so we told him, "You can
do this, but don't do that.


1191
01:08:17.039 --> 01:08:18.279
"And do this and don't do that."

1192
01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:20.479
And he said, "Yeah, yeah.
I got it, I got it."


1193
01:08:20.559 --> 01:08:23.159
But he wasn't getting it.
And then, he was...


1194
01:08:23.239 --> 01:08:24.959
And he gets up on stage

1195
01:08:25.039 --> 01:08:29.960
and he starts playing with
Graphicraft like some crazy monkey,


1196
01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:32.720
when we know that the
thing is so fragile,


1197
01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.080
and the hardware's just
barely holding it together.


1198
01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:39.720
And the one thing that was
a disaster was flood fill.


1199
01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:43.720
That the flood fill wasn't working
correctly in the hardware. It would leak.


1200
01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:47.200
And if you clicked in the wrong place
and made it flood fill the wrong way,


1201
01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:50.520
it would leak and fill the entire
thing, and wipe out your entire image.


1202
01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:54.120
And so we told him, "Whatever you
do, don't touch the flood fill."


1203
01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.760
So the first thing the guy
reaches for is the flood fill.


1204
01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.240
And he's all, like...

1205
01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.560
And you gotta see,
Jack's face is...


1206
01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:08.840
Oh, God, it's just so awesome!
He's filled with this horror.


1207
01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:12.200
It's going down!
It's going down.


1208
01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:14.080
And he clicked on it and
he created the flood fill.


1209
01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.960
And I think all of us that
were on the engineering team,


1210
01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.400
sitting in the
audience, were like,


1211
01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:21.040
"No! What's gonna happen now?"

1212
01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.040
And we saw that flood fill
and it kind of filled in.


1213
01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.280
You know, you watched
it progress,


1214
01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:27.160
and you thought it'd get to the end and
then there'd be a guru meditation.


1215
01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.160
You know, the machine
would've crashed.


1216
01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.680
But, no, it didn't. It made
it through and it was all...


1217
01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:35.440
And we were relieved by that.

1218
01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:38.240
The immediate reaction after
the launch was phenomenal.


1219
01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:40.480
The kinds of words that,
you know, you just...


1220
01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.840
You'd write for yourself if
you wanted to write them


1221
01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.240
to describe something
phenomenal.


1222
01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:46.680
They responded very much like
people do to video games.


1223
01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:49.360
"Why have the graphics gotten better?
Why has the sound has gotten better?"


1224
01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:52.240
Because you respond to it with
your ears, with your eyes.


1225
01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.760
The tactofeel we now have in game
controllers and things as well,


1226
01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.760
and with feedback,
that's all a part of it.


1227
01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.840
Because as human beings,
that's what we respond to.


1228
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:04.960
And we knocked their socks off,
absolutely knocked their socks off.


1229
01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:14.840
Re-experience the
mind unbounded.


1230
01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:23.560
Amiga, the first personal computer
that gives you a creative edge.


1231
01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:27.200
There used to be this massive,
massive disparity between the games


1232
01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:29.560
that we could play at home
and the kind of technology,


1233
01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:32.600
and the quality experience you
could get in the arcades.


1234
01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:34.200
And that was always
really evident


1235
01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:38.680
when you would see, like, the Spectrum
or the Commodore 64 adaptations,


1236
01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.480
the conversions of
those coin-op games.


1237
01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:42.320
I think Operation Wolf
was one that I remember.


1238
01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.680
It had the gun. The graphics
were actually really cool.


1239
01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.080
Then you would come home and play
on your 64 or your Spectrum,


1240
01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.400
and it was just nothing like it.

1241
01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.920
I mean, it wasn't anything like
Operation Wolf in anything but name.


1242
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.560
And that was always
kind of depressing.


1243
01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:56.320
What I think is actually really interesting
about the Amiga generation is,


1244
01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.480
I think that was the first time that
we really started to close that gap.


1245
01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.240
By the time the Amiga came out,

1246
01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:04.760
there were already
coin-operated arcade machines


1247
01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.200
also using the Motorola MC68000.

1248
01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:10.560
And you could see in the
arcades what you could do


1249
01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:13.120
when you spent $5,000
or $10,000 on hardware


1250
01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.440
and built out a
really fabulous game.


1251
01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:18.120
And I'm thinking about games at
that time like Marble Madness.


1252
01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.800
Of course, we later licensed Marble
Madness and brought it to the Amiga.


1253
01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:23.720
That's the kind of thing
that became possible.


1254
01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:28.160
Suddenly, you could do things at
home that were pretty mind-boggling.


1255
01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.760
When I saw Marble Madness for
the first time on the Amiga,


1256
01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:34.720
it was shocking. And it
was shocking because,


1257
01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.280
as far as I can recall,

1258
01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:42.160
it was the first time that a
video game on a home computer,


1259
01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.080
pixel for pixel,

1260
01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.120
replicated an arcade game.

1261
01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:49.920
It was the arcade version.
There is no difference.


1262
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.360
There might be very
slight differences,


1263
01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:56.880
but the quality of that Amiga version
was so fantastic at the time.


1264
01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.360
It looked like an arcade game.

1265
01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.720
And that was the big excitement.
You wanted that.


1266
01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.200
I just loved its clean clarity.

1267
01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.880
Marble Madness was
well-suited to the Amiga,


1268
01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.720
because it scrolled
these playfields.


1269
01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.732
The background as the marble was rolling

1270
01:12:11.757 --> 01:12:14.544
was a perfect operation for the chips.

1271
01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:17.920
So I think what the Amiga
really did as a computer was


1272
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.720
it sort of took the blinders
off game developers


1273
01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:24.160
and it allowed us to start creating
more immersive experiences


1274
01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.520
with better graphics
and better sounds.


1275
01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:30.240
And it opened up the potential audience
to a much larger group of people


1276
01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:33.360
that were looking for something,
you know, a bit more entertaining


1277
01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:36.400
than what they were getting
from the 8-bit computers.


1278
01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.640
The first time I saw
Defender of the Crown,


1279
01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:48.720
I had to ask
the guy behind the counter

1280
01:12:48.745 --> 01:12:50.944
to show me that it was
actually running code.


1281
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.480
He said, "Have a go." "OK."

1282
01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:57.840
"Oh, my God."

1283
01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.800
I still remember playing the jousting.
The jousting was great.


1284
01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:04.320
It was like you were...
You were in a movie.


1285
01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:07.400
And yes, a pixelated
movie, but still.


1286
01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.139
Compared to the games you'd been playing

1287
01:13:09.164 --> 01:13:11.024
only maybe a year or two before that,

1288
01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.280
the graphical fidelity
was astonishing.


1289
01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:16.760
Bob Jacob at Cinemaware
absolutely loved movies,


1290
01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.881
and that's why he
started the company.


1291
01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:23.641
He had a real passion for storytelling
and for creating immersive environments,


1292
01:13:23.721 --> 01:13:26.201
and the Amiga allowed
him to do that.


1293
01:13:26.281 --> 01:13:32.161
It gave you this cinema experience
where you just didn't play a game,


1294
01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:33.881
but between the levels,

1295
01:13:33.961 --> 01:13:38.601
you'd see cutscenes where you, the hero,
was getting together with a woman,


1296
01:13:38.681 --> 01:13:42.361
or you, the hero, was demanding
justice from the bad guys.


1297
01:13:42.441 --> 01:13:46.161
We were able to do cutscenes
that had actual animation.


1298
01:13:47.321 --> 01:13:51.241
So when you rescue the princess and
you have the sword fighting scene,


1299
01:13:51.321 --> 01:13:56.441
you can have a cutscene at the end
where you have shadows on the wall,


1300
01:13:56.521 --> 01:13:59.401
and the hero embraces
the princess,


1301
01:13:59.481 --> 01:14:02.201
and we could let your
imagination run wild with that.


1302
01:14:02.281 --> 01:14:04.567
And it was a
game that brought you in,

1303
01:14:04.592 --> 01:14:07.465
in a way that no other
game had done before.


1304
01:14:07.681 --> 01:14:10.121
And the game design
itself was good.


1305
01:14:10.201 --> 01:14:14.961
But there was this artist, Jim Sachs,
who was the art lead on that project,


1306
01:14:15.041 --> 01:14:17.481
and it was his magic

1307
01:14:17.561 --> 01:14:21.201
that turned that game from
a commonplace experience


1308
01:14:21.281 --> 01:14:23.521
into something like no one
had ever seen before.


1309
01:14:23.601 --> 01:14:27.681
Jim Sachs, I can say without
any hesitation, was a genius.


1310
01:14:27.761 --> 01:14:30.681
And Defender of the Crown
would not have been a success


1311
01:14:30.761 --> 01:14:32.521
if it hadn't been for Jim Sachs.

1312
01:14:32.601 --> 01:14:35.041
When I started doing the graphics
for Defender of the Crown,


1313
01:14:35.121 --> 01:14:37.321
the tools were
extremely primitive.


1314
01:14:37.401 --> 01:14:40.201
It was still Graphicraft
and Aegis Images.


1315
01:14:40.281 --> 01:14:43.121
So I was drawing castles
one dot at a time.


1316
01:14:43.201 --> 01:14:48.801
I'd do a sketch on paper, or I'd see
magazine articles about castles.


1317
01:14:48.881 --> 01:14:50.441
And I'd have that picture

1318
01:14:50.521 --> 01:14:52.761
and then do something
like that on the screen,


1319
01:14:52.841 --> 01:14:54.201
literally one dot at a time.

1320
01:14:54.281 --> 01:15:00.161
And put about five or six dots together
and that forms a block of stone.


1321
01:15:00.241 --> 01:15:04.241
And then, at that point, you
could clip out groups of pixels


1322
01:15:04.321 --> 01:15:06.801
and stamp them in as brushes.

1323
01:15:06.881 --> 01:15:09.361
So I was doing that. Stone
after stone after stone.


1324
01:15:09.441 --> 01:15:11.201
Finally, you have one tower,

1325
01:15:11.281 --> 01:15:14.801
and then draw the grass and
everything growing up to that.


1326
01:15:14.881 --> 01:15:16.321
Very time-consuming.

1327
01:15:16.401 --> 01:15:19.201
And after about
probably two weeks,


1328
01:15:19.281 --> 01:15:22.321
I had drawn the first castle
on a hill and turned that in.


1329
01:15:22.401 --> 01:15:24.001
And it just blew them
away, of course.


1330
01:15:24.121 --> 01:15:27.881
You know, it was just so much different
than anything else that they had seen.


1331
01:15:28.081 --> 01:15:31.641
So then, they could get an idea of what
the whole game was gonna look like,


1332
01:15:31.721 --> 01:15:33.841
and started to get really
excited about the whole thing.


1333
01:15:33.921 --> 01:15:37.561
The design itself reached for

1334
01:15:37.641 --> 01:15:42.921
the kind of softer entertainment
experience that is commonplace today.


1335
01:15:43.001 --> 01:15:45.164
Everyone's comfortable
with the fact


1336
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:48.345
that software does that
movie thing that it does.


1337
01:15:48.401 --> 01:15:51.401
But Defender of the Crown,
the Cinemaware title,


1338
01:15:51.481 --> 01:15:54.881
was one of the first
that made that a reality


1339
01:15:54.961 --> 01:15:57.881
where you were no longer
just playing a game.


1340
01:15:57.961 --> 01:15:59.801
Because it demonstrated
not just graphically,


1341
01:15:59.881 --> 01:16:03.721
visually, this was a quantum leap
beyond anything we had seen in 8-bit.


1342
01:16:03.801 --> 01:16:05.241
It was certainly that.

1343
01:16:05.321 --> 01:16:08.441
But it was the kind of game
that just wasn't even possible.


1344
01:16:08.521 --> 01:16:12.161
There was nothing quite like Defender
of the Crown before it came out.


1345
01:16:12.241 --> 01:16:15.761
And it was definitely a signal
for where video games could go.


1346
01:16:15.841 --> 01:16:18.761
I didn't think all video
games would take that route,


1347
01:16:18.841 --> 01:16:22.761
but in terms of production values
and the ability to draw in people


1348
01:16:22.841 --> 01:16:26.681
who otherwise haven't been
interested in video games before.


1349
01:16:26.761 --> 01:16:29.649
The idea that a video game could
be a mass market activity


1350
01:16:29.674 --> 01:16:30.945
and not just a niche,

1351
01:16:31.001 --> 01:16:33.481
I think Defender of the Crown
was, if not the first,


1352
01:16:33.561 --> 01:16:35.441
then one of the very
first to signal that.


1353
01:16:49.121 --> 01:16:52.481
When the Amiga 1000 came off
the manufacturing line,


1354
01:16:53.001 --> 01:16:57.161
most of us were... "Amazed"
is the wrong word.


1355
01:16:57.241 --> 01:16:59.521
"Distressed" was a better word,

1356
01:16:59.641 --> 01:17:03.681
at what appeared to be
wholly inadequate marketing


1357
01:17:03.761 --> 01:17:05.201
on the part of Commodore.

1358
01:17:05.281 --> 01:17:09.161
They didn't really have a good focus, and
I think part of that was the fact that


1359
01:17:09.241 --> 01:17:12.361
the Amiga computer was so capable
of doing almost anything.


1360
01:17:12.441 --> 01:17:13.711
Unfortunately,

1361
01:17:13.736 --> 01:17:17.545
with the loss of the leadership of
Jack Tramiel that very same year,


1362
01:17:17.601 --> 01:17:21.241
Commodore was a little bit lost
as to what direction to take.


1363
01:17:21.321 --> 01:17:24.961
Their actions basically said, "We
don't understand what we got here."


1364
01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:28.681
They were shipping
containerloads of Commodore 64s.


1365
01:17:28.761 --> 01:17:31.921
They were shipping high volume
to these mass merchants.


1366
01:17:32.001 --> 01:17:33.578
And then all of a sudden,

1367
01:17:33.603 --> 01:17:37.385
along comes a good buy in
buying the Amiga technology,


1368
01:17:37.441 --> 01:17:41.121
because somebody had the vision to
go after the Macintosh business


1369
01:17:41.201 --> 01:17:44.561
and the business side
of the channels,


1370
01:17:44.641 --> 01:17:48.361
but nobody in the company
really had the experience.


1371
01:17:48.441 --> 01:17:52.121
They just didn't know how to market
any longer a computer like this


1372
01:17:52.201 --> 01:17:54.361
to that computer-based trait.

1373
01:17:54.441 --> 01:17:57.241
They really only understood
a no-mass market.


1374
01:17:57.321 --> 01:18:01.441
And the other part of it is that they
yanked the development, a support,


1375
01:18:01.521 --> 01:18:03.321
that had to be out there
in order to get software,


1376
01:18:03.401 --> 01:18:05.002
a meaningful software,
done in this thing.


1377
01:18:05.282 --> 01:18:07.842
They were so used to
the software community


1378
01:18:07.922 --> 01:18:13.362
going and fulfilling the Commodore

1379
01:18:13.442 --> 01:18:16.402
that they never really programmed
them for the conformity


1380
01:18:16.482 --> 01:18:18.682
of dealing with the
Amiga technology.


1381
01:18:18.762 --> 01:18:21.202
Commodore 64 software was
a grass-roots effort.


1382
01:18:22.202 --> 01:18:25.482
Software developers out in the field
went and did what they wanted to do.


1383
01:18:25.562 --> 01:18:27.602
Sometimes without the
help of Commodore.


1384
01:18:27.682 --> 01:18:29.282
Wasn't that easy to
do on the Amiga.


1385
01:18:29.362 --> 01:18:31.242
You needed the books. You
needed some training.


1386
01:18:31.322 --> 01:18:33.842
You needed some support
back from the company.


1387
01:18:33.922 --> 01:18:35.762
And Commodore didn't provide it.

1388
01:18:35.842 --> 01:18:40.162
Almost all the first-line software
that came out of that machine


1389
01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:45.362
was written by internal Amiga guys who
just basically sat down and wrote it.


1390
01:18:46.042 --> 01:18:48.322
Because they understood we had
to have these applications,


1391
01:18:48.402 --> 01:18:51.162
otherwise we had a nice
demo, but that was it.


1392
01:18:51.242 --> 01:18:54.322
We travelled around to 30
cities, launching the Amiga.


1393
01:18:54.402 --> 01:18:56.802
And we had everybody
ready for it.


1394
01:18:56.882 --> 01:18:58.042
But then, when we went home,

1395
01:18:58.122 --> 01:19:01.802
we found out they had already
had a conversation with Kmart


1396
01:19:02.082 --> 01:19:03.823
and Wal-Mart, and some
of these other guys


1397
01:19:03.848 --> 01:19:05.426
who were just used to selling numbers,

1398
01:19:05.482 --> 01:19:08.491
and they could care less
about support for the people


1399
01:19:08.516 --> 01:19:10.466
who wanted to do productivity.

1400
01:19:10.522 --> 01:19:12.962
They just wanted to
sell tons of games.


1401
01:19:13.402 --> 01:19:15.562
But again, that's all they knew.

1402
01:19:15.642 --> 01:19:18.202
Their experience had said,
"Hey, we'll get started,


1403
01:19:18.282 --> 01:19:20.042
"and then we'll take
it to the mass market,


1404
01:19:20.122 --> 01:19:22.562
"and we'll have another
Commodore 64 on our hands."


1405
01:19:23.442 --> 01:19:25.402
It wasn't a Commodore 64.

1406
01:19:25.482 --> 01:19:29.922
So, you know, to market it like that, I
mean, you just flunked Marketing 101.


1407
01:19:30.442 --> 01:19:33.082
And that's where we got lost.

1408
01:19:33.162 --> 01:19:35.482
We had no way to
sell that product.


1409
01:19:35.562 --> 01:19:39.562
All we had to do was give
it to the mass merchant,


1410
01:19:39.642 --> 01:19:42.522
and the mass merchant would end
up sending back the product


1411
01:19:42.602 --> 01:19:44.143
when the customer returned it to them,

1412
01:19:44.168 --> 01:19:45.906
because they didn't
know how to boot it up.


1413
01:19:46.162 --> 01:19:49.522
The ethos of Commodore,
it never had a plan,


1414
01:19:49.602 --> 01:19:52.602
so therefore, it never
questioned what was happening.


1415
01:19:52.682 --> 01:19:55.802
They stumbled from crisis
to crisis to crisis,


1416
01:19:55.882 --> 01:19:58.682
and just firefighting more time
than they were in planning.


1417
01:19:58.762 --> 01:20:01.562
After the west coast
guys left Commodore,


1418
01:20:01.642 --> 01:20:03.842
Commodore had to turn to
their own internal engineers


1419
01:20:03.922 --> 01:20:06.562
to continue development
of the Amiga system.


1420
01:20:06.642 --> 01:20:10.202
And so, what they said was,
"We're gonna go both ways.


1421
01:20:10.282 --> 01:20:14.682
"We're gonna have an Amiga computer
that's really aimed for business.


1422
01:20:14.762 --> 01:20:19.042
"It's gonna be very high-end, even
higher-end than the Amiga 1000 was.


1423
01:20:19.122 --> 01:20:22.002
"And we're also gonna
do a lower-end Amiga


1424
01:20:22.082 --> 01:20:24.522
"that's gonna be a
Commodore 64 replacement."


1425
01:20:25.082 --> 01:20:29.082
And so that's how the Amiga 500
came about and the Amiga 2000.


1426
01:20:29.802 --> 01:20:33.015
You are about to step into a
brave new world of power,


1427
01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.026
performance and productivity,

1428
01:20:35.082 --> 01:20:38.922
made possible by the new Commodore
Amiga 500 home computer.


1429
01:20:39.002 --> 01:20:42.122
Sit back and get set for
the ride of your life.


1430
01:20:44.682 --> 01:20:47.562
I am the Commodore Amiga 500.

1431
01:20:47.642 --> 01:20:48.802
Why do the A500?

1432
01:20:48.882 --> 01:20:51.082
I think the big idea there

1433
01:20:51.162 --> 01:20:54.322
was to make something that
Commodore understood better.


1434
01:20:54.402 --> 01:20:57.522
You know, Commodore was never that
good at selling higher-end systems.


1435
01:20:57.602 --> 01:21:00.642
And the A500 sort of hit

1436
01:21:00.722 --> 01:21:05.242
the same exact market
spot that the C128 had.


1437
01:21:05.322 --> 01:21:08.762
It was... You know, it was something
that a Commodore fan would recognise.


1438
01:21:08.842 --> 01:21:12.762
It was kind of what people thought about
home computers, at least in the '80s.


1439
01:21:12.882 --> 01:21:17.242
So, my recollection of the
origin of the A500 was


1440
01:21:17.322 --> 01:21:22.042
Gerard Bucas asked Jeff
Porter, George Robbins and I


1441
01:21:22.122 --> 01:21:26.882
to look at the A1000 and see
if we could cost reduce it.


1442
01:21:27.042 --> 01:21:30.322
So we had the schematics
that Dave Needle had done,


1443
01:21:30.402 --> 01:21:34.962
and we just decided the things that
were gonna reduce the cost were


1444
01:21:35.042 --> 01:21:40.362
getting rid of the writable control store
and putting it into a singular case,


1445
01:21:40.442 --> 01:21:42.082
and having a brick power supply.

1446
01:21:42.362 --> 01:21:44.842
And we looked at the Agnus
chip in particular,


1447
01:21:44.922 --> 01:21:47.602
which ended up getting
some stuff rolled into it.


1448
01:21:48.002 --> 01:21:52.642
And it was a big cost reduction. I mean,
the A1000 case was very expensive.


1449
01:21:52.722 --> 01:21:54.442
The lack of integration,
a lot of those...


1450
01:21:54.522 --> 01:21:58.402
All those separate chips that got
dramatically reduced with the Fat Agnus


1451
01:21:58.482 --> 01:21:59.802
reduced the cost of it.

1452
01:21:59.882 --> 01:22:04.002
It was really just, "Let's deliver
the same level of technology,


1453
01:22:04.082 --> 01:22:07.069
"but, you know, mechanically,
electronically,


1454
01:22:07.094 --> 01:22:09.106
whatever we can, cut the cost,

1455
01:22:09.162 --> 01:22:10.962
"so that we can make something

1456
01:22:10.987 --> 01:22:13.986
that Commodore people
know what to do with."


1457
01:22:14.322 --> 01:22:18.602
Jeff and I took that proposal
to a meeting with Jay Miner,


1458
01:22:18.682 --> 01:22:21.122
and we showed the factoring
that we wanted to do.


1459
01:22:21.202 --> 01:22:23.922
There was some debate as to whether
the clock stuff was gonna work,


1460
01:22:24.002 --> 01:22:26.602
but Jay Miner was like, "No.
That should work," you know.


1461
01:22:26.682 --> 01:22:29.682
And that was... It was cool meeting him.
I had never met him before.


1462
01:22:29.762 --> 01:22:33.482
He was very much
professional about


1463
01:22:33.562 --> 01:22:39.482
assessing whether what we were proposing
made sense technically speaking.


1464
01:22:39.562 --> 01:22:43.602
I'd been advised that they
were producing an A500,


1465
01:22:43.682 --> 01:22:46.402
that it was going to be aimed
at the consumer market.


1466
01:22:46.482 --> 01:22:48.282
And as soon as it arrived,

1467
01:22:48.307 --> 01:22:52.947
it definitely lived up to all
of our expectations and beyond.


1468
01:22:53.003 --> 01:22:56.483
Because the capabilities of
it were equally as good as


1469
01:22:56.563 --> 01:22:58.803
the majority of things
you could do on the 1000


1470
01:22:58.883 --> 01:23:02.003
at probably 25% of the

1471
01:23:02.083 --> 01:23:05.243
I'm actually very proud of that
machine, cos I think it...


1472
01:23:05.323 --> 01:23:08.923
I thought it preserved
the spirit of the Amiga


1473
01:23:09.323 --> 01:23:14.083
while making it much more
available, in terms of price.


1474
01:23:14.163 --> 01:23:17.963
We were a consumer company
selling game computers,


1475
01:23:18.043 --> 01:23:21.963
and it doesn't mean that should be the
only thing Commodore was, but that...


1476
01:23:22.043 --> 01:23:23.883
Everyone knew that's
what our strength was.


1477
01:23:23.963 --> 01:23:29.203
The thing about the 500 was that
it was very clearly a realisation


1478
01:23:29.283 --> 01:23:30.963
that there is a games market,

1479
01:23:31.043 --> 01:23:33.833
and we need to put something out
that people can play games on,


1480
01:23:33.858 --> 01:23:34.787
and that was it.

1481
01:23:35.243 --> 01:23:37.123
So it served as a
great games machine,


1482
01:23:37.203 --> 01:23:38.723
and as a really good
development machine as well.


1483
01:23:38.803 --> 01:23:41.803
But I think that was a case
of Commodore realising


1484
01:23:41.883 --> 01:23:45.443
they had to directly address
the market that they created.


1485
01:24:13.963 --> 01:24:16.123
Using the Amiga for the first
time was a revelation.


1486
01:24:16.203 --> 01:24:18.123
It was like a veil
had been lifted.


1487
01:24:18.203 --> 01:24:22.643
It not only allowed us to dream,
it allowed us to dream big.


1488
01:24:34.203 --> 01:24:37.763
People who do game development
and some application development


1489
01:24:37.843 --> 01:24:40.043
can look at a PC or other machines

1490
01:24:40.123 --> 01:24:42.009
and see how much work it takes

1491
01:24:42.034 --> 01:24:45.427
to get the machine to do
what you want it to do,


1492
01:24:45.483 --> 01:24:50.083
and how easy it is to get the Amiga
to do what you want it to do.


1493
01:24:50.163 --> 01:24:52.123
So your energy and your time

1494
01:24:52.203 --> 01:24:56.123
are not spent on tricking the machine
to produce a piece of graphics.


1495
01:24:56.203 --> 01:25:01.403
They're spent on your invention
and your art and your creativity.


1496
01:25:01.483 --> 01:25:02.843
The goal that Jay and I had

1497
01:25:02.923 --> 01:25:07.323
was to advance the state of the art

1498
01:25:07.403 --> 01:25:10.843
And when you advance the state
of the art sufficiently,


1499
01:25:11.323 --> 01:25:13.754
you get into the realm where
you're doing something


1500
01:25:13.779 --> 01:25:15.507
that people find completely new.

1501
01:25:15.563 --> 01:25:19.523
It expands their capability to
do things you can't do before


1502
01:25:19.603 --> 01:25:22.923
with 10 times more horsepower.
In some cases, even more.


1503
01:25:23.003 --> 01:25:24.353
Game developers now,

1504
01:25:24.378 --> 01:25:28.427
who typically might have just
been writing assembly code


1505
01:25:28.483 --> 01:25:32.643
or were doing as much as they can
just to get the hardware to do stuff,


1506
01:25:32.723 --> 01:25:34.883
all of a sudden,
they had a computer


1507
01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:37.883
that basically would do
most of the work for them.


1508
01:25:37.963 --> 01:25:39.763
There was the graphics chips

1509
01:25:39.843 --> 01:25:42.723
that were doing the blitting and
the moving of the graphics.


1510
01:25:42.803 --> 01:25:46.083
There were sprites that would just
appear where you wanted them to appear.


1511
01:25:46.163 --> 01:25:47.283
Multi-colour sprites.

1512
01:25:47.363 --> 01:25:51.563
You could do the play field animation.
You could do play field scrolling.


1513
01:25:51.643 --> 01:25:55.963
You could do simulated 3D perspective
stuff by using differential scrolling.


1514
01:25:56.043 --> 01:26:01.883
More colours using the run-length
compression in the Hold-and-Modify.


1515
01:26:01.963 --> 01:26:05.643
A multi-channel sampled audio
instead of beeps and boops.


1516
01:26:05.723 --> 01:26:09.363
So if you're a game developer,
and you saw the opportunity


1517
01:26:09.443 --> 01:26:11.472
to do what you could
with the Amiga


1518
01:26:11.497 --> 01:26:14.427
to advance the state of
your gaming creativity,


1519
01:26:14.483 --> 01:26:17.043
all of a sudden, this
gave you a new tool.


1520
01:26:32.363 --> 01:26:36.523
So it really appealed
to the creative edge.


1521
01:26:36.603 --> 01:26:38.643
That was what the
Amiga was about.


1522
01:26:38.723 --> 01:26:41.403
That was actually the slogan, was
that it gave you the creative edge.


1523
01:26:41.483 --> 01:26:44.083
And it really did. And
it took all the people


1524
01:26:44.163 --> 01:26:48.403
that were not just bland PCers that
just want to do PC-types of stuff,


1525
01:26:48.483 --> 01:26:50.723
but it just opened up
this whole new world.


1526
01:26:50.803 --> 01:26:53.163
The first time I saw it,
I was just blown away.


1527
01:26:53.243 --> 01:26:57.203
It was difficult to believe
just what a huge leap it was.


1528
01:26:57.283 --> 01:27:02.883
It just felt like you were just touching
science fiction, it was so advanced.


1529
01:27:02.963 --> 01:27:06.843
When it comes to the Amiga, the
world was really your oyster.


1530
01:27:06.923 --> 01:27:08.243
It really was...

1531
01:27:08.323 --> 01:27:09.223
It widened my world.

1532
01:27:09.248 --> 01:27:11.947
Cos I thought, "Well, we can
do anything we want to do."


1533
01:27:14.243 --> 01:27:15.283
So my mind just exploded.

1534
01:27:15.363 --> 01:27:17.803
Amiga was so smooth,
you know what I mean?


1535
01:27:17.883 --> 01:27:19.043
It was like a Porsche.

1536
01:27:21.163 --> 01:27:25.603
It had Copper. It had
this amazing sound chip.


1537
01:27:25.683 --> 01:27:27.083
Beautiful colours.

1538
01:27:27.163 --> 01:27:31.243
It was very fast. It was a
better machine all round.


1539
01:27:31.883 --> 01:27:35.603
And you could tell from the
games that were coming out.


1540
01:27:35.683 --> 01:27:37.683
To me, machines are machines,

1541
01:27:37.763 --> 01:27:40.124
and all I talk about with machines
is what's wrong with them.


1542
01:27:40.684 --> 01:27:43.164
I just only ever see
problems in machines.


1543
01:27:43.244 --> 01:27:45.945
Things that they're stopping me
from doing more efficiently,


1544
01:27:45.970 --> 01:27:46.988
that I want to do.

1545
01:27:47.404 --> 01:27:50.524
But the Amiga, actually, of all
of the machines I've worked on,


1546
01:27:50.604 --> 01:27:52.439
was the one which gave me the most

1547
01:27:52.464 --> 01:27:55.348
of what you wanted to deliver
the most painlessly.


1548
01:27:55.404 --> 01:27:57.364
From a designer's point of view,
it was a brilliant machine.


1549
01:27:57.444 --> 01:27:59.564
It was very accessible.

1550
01:27:59.644 --> 01:28:01.724
The programmers learned to get
very, very skilful at it.


1551
01:28:01.804 --> 01:28:04.364
But they didn't struggle too
much to get up and running.


1552
01:28:04.644 --> 01:28:06.644
So, still, in those days,

1553
01:28:07.204 --> 01:28:12.284
you could spend 75% of making the game
development time on making the game,


1554
01:28:12.364 --> 01:28:17.324
and 25% on doing the structure and
stuff, the routines to make it work.


1555
01:28:17.404 --> 01:28:19.804
What the Amiga did is
it inspired people


1556
01:28:19.884 --> 01:28:22.324
to explore the boundaries of
what the machine could do.


1557
01:28:22.404 --> 01:28:25.084
There was so much hardware in there,
compared to the other machines,


1558
01:28:25.164 --> 01:28:26.265
that you could play around with,

1559
01:28:26.290 --> 01:28:28.148
and there was so much
sneaky stuff you could do.


1560
01:28:28.204 --> 01:28:29.924
There was the
Hold-and-Modify mode,


1561
01:28:30.004 --> 01:28:33.084
and there was the weird modes where
it only had a 32-colour palette,


1562
01:28:33.164 --> 01:28:36.844
but you could get

1563
01:28:36.924 --> 01:28:38.764
that were basically half as
bright versions of that.


1564
01:28:38.844 --> 01:28:41.684
And so, it does inspire
people to get into the idea


1565
01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:44.468
that they're gonna have to explore
the different corners of stuff.


1566
01:28:44.764 --> 01:28:45.844
In the beginning,

1567
01:28:45.924 --> 01:28:51.244
if you wanted to put bitmapped
graphics onto a screen,


1568
01:28:51.324 --> 01:28:53.244
you'd have to create them,

1569
01:28:53.324 --> 01:28:57.084
you'd have to use the
computer, the computer's CPU,


1570
01:28:57.164 --> 01:29:00.324
to actually draw those
pixels onto the screen.


1571
01:29:00.404 --> 01:29:01.684
And that would take time,

1572
01:29:01.764 --> 01:29:05.244
and while the computer was doing that,
it couldn't be doing anything else.


1573
01:29:05.324 --> 01:29:08.844
And very often, in the early games, Jet
Set Willy is a good example of that,


1574
01:29:08.924 --> 01:29:11.964
nearly all of the time that
the computer was spending


1575
01:29:12.044 --> 01:29:14.684
was spent drawing
pixels onto the screen


1576
01:29:14.764 --> 01:29:17.604
and that left very little
time left for anything else.


1577
01:29:17.684 --> 01:29:19.644
What a blitter does,

1578
01:29:19.724 --> 01:29:23.124
is it says, "Hey, I'm really good at this.
I'm really fast.


1579
01:29:23.204 --> 01:29:27.484
"I can take a bunch of pixels, which
correspond to an image from one place,


1580
01:29:27.564 --> 01:29:30.524
"combine them in fancy ways
with another bunch of pixels,


1581
01:29:30.604 --> 01:29:35.804
"like a mask or a stencil from another
place, and put them onto the screen,


1582
01:29:35.884 --> 01:29:39.404
"in whatever way you want in
any number of combinations,


1583
01:29:39.484 --> 01:29:40.844
"to form a final image,

1584
01:29:40.924 --> 01:29:44.644
"and I can do this 10 times
faster, 20 times faster,


1585
01:29:44.724 --> 01:29:46.044
"than the processor can do it."

1586
01:29:46.124 --> 01:29:50.564
So what that meant was, the processor
was free to do lots of other things,


1587
01:29:50.644 --> 01:29:52.884
like AI for example,
like collisions,


1588
01:29:52.964 --> 01:29:58.124
and the blitter allowed you to create an
immense amount of detail in the display


1589
01:29:58.404 --> 01:30:00.564
in a fraction of the time
that it used to take.


1590
01:30:00.644 --> 01:30:04.204
And the Copper lists allowed
us to change colours,


1591
01:30:04.284 --> 01:30:08.804
and shift things left and right slightly,
and do all these crazy things.


1592
01:30:09.124 --> 01:30:12.084
And we built a lot of the
games around these effects.


1593
01:30:12.244 --> 01:30:16.124
It's like, we could scroll
things and move them


1594
01:30:16.204 --> 01:30:18.604
without even really having
to put any effort in.


1595
01:30:18.684 --> 01:30:21.924
A lot of the hardware in there
is very specifically aimed


1596
01:30:22.004 --> 01:30:26.804
at the kind of things that we as game
designers and game producers require,


1597
01:30:26.884 --> 01:30:28.564
or certainly did back in the day.

1598
01:30:28.644 --> 01:30:32.764
To try and replicate the effects that
you get in arcade machines of the day,


1599
01:30:32.844 --> 01:30:35.284
you needed very powerful
hardware scrolling.


1600
01:30:35.364 --> 01:30:36.828
You needed sprite systems,

1601
01:30:36.853 --> 01:30:39.948
ways of moving objects in
front of other objects,


1602
01:30:40.004 --> 01:30:41.237
and obscuring backgrounds

1603
01:30:41.262 --> 01:30:43.628
and restoring backgrounds
quickly, easily,


1604
01:30:43.684 --> 01:30:44.750
and freeing up the processor

1605
01:30:44.775 --> 01:30:46.868
to do the main
game loop, as it were.

1606
01:30:46.924 --> 01:30:51.684
So there was a lot of hardware in there
that you could see precious little use


1607
01:30:51.764 --> 01:30:54.604
for anything else other than games
or graphics demos, to be honest.


1608
01:30:54.684 --> 01:30:56.564
So it was a dream
machine, really,


1609
01:30:56.644 --> 01:30:59.684
because it really felt like it
had been created specifically


1610
01:30:59.764 --> 01:31:04.444
to produce the kind of games
that you saw in the arcades


1611
01:31:04.524 --> 01:31:06.324
and the kind of effects that
you saw in the arcades.


1612
01:31:06.404 --> 01:31:08.969
I think the thing that impressed
me the most about the Amiga,


1613
01:31:08.994 --> 01:31:10.068
besides the graphics,

1614
01:31:10.124 --> 01:31:12.604
was there was an actual
operating system on it.


1615
01:31:12.684 --> 01:31:14.804
Coming from the Commodore 64,

1616
01:31:14.884 --> 01:31:18.164
where you got a little prompt and you
could type in some BASIC commands,


1617
01:31:18.244 --> 01:31:19.924
the Amiga had a real OS.

1618
01:31:20.004 --> 01:31:24.084
There were files, and you could do a
shell and all that kind of stuff.


1619
01:31:24.164 --> 01:31:26.444
To me, that was very
interesting about the Amiga.


1620
01:31:26.524 --> 01:31:28.884
I think the biggest thing of all

1621
01:31:28.964 --> 01:31:32.084
was that the Amiga had a mouse.

1622
01:31:33.004 --> 01:31:36.284
So as soon as a mouse came
along, you had the freedom


1623
01:31:36.364 --> 01:31:38.506
to make the player be able to move

1624
01:31:38.531 --> 01:31:41.468
wherever they wanted
on screen immediately,


1625
01:31:41.524 --> 01:31:42.884
and that was a huge thing.

1626
01:31:42.964 --> 01:31:45.844
And that you had these two buttons,

1627
01:31:45.924 --> 01:31:49.084
fire, hold for scroll around.

1628
01:31:49.164 --> 01:31:52.684
And they had up, down, up,
down, so that's four inputs,


1629
01:31:52.764 --> 01:31:55.604
where we were only used to
one and the four directions.


1630
01:31:55.764 --> 01:31:57.644
That was incredibly important.

1631
01:31:57.724 --> 01:31:59.524
And it's even small things
to do with the mouse.


1632
01:31:59.604 --> 01:32:03.204
I remember the PC version of
Lemmings versus the Amiga one,


1633
01:32:03.284 --> 01:32:06.324
and for me, the Amiga one always
played much, much, much better.


1634
01:32:06.404 --> 01:32:08.444
And the real reason for that

1635
01:32:08.524 --> 01:32:11.964
was, actually, the Amiga
had a hardware cursor.


1636
01:32:12.044 --> 01:32:17.444
So no matter what speed your game ran
at, which was 30 frames per second,


1637
01:32:17.524 --> 01:32:20.124
the mouse moved at 60
frames per second.


1638
01:32:20.284 --> 01:32:21.964
And on the Amiga,
that was really nice.


1639
01:32:22.044 --> 01:32:25.884
You felt like you had really fine control
for when you were clicking as well.


1640
01:32:25.964 --> 01:32:28.765
Cos it could read the
click 60 times a second.


1641
01:32:28.885 --> 01:32:32.325
The PC only had
software mouse control.


1642
01:32:32.405 --> 01:32:35.205
So it was only moving the mouse
at 30 frames per second.


1643
01:32:35.285 --> 01:32:38.205
I could only register a click

1644
01:32:38.285 --> 01:32:40.645
For me, those two differences
are really subtle,


1645
01:32:40.725 --> 01:32:43.433
but the fact that you could run
the game at 30 frames per second


1646
01:32:43.458 --> 01:32:44.749
but move your input at 60,

1647
01:32:44.805 --> 01:32:48.645
once again, just showed how
advanced the Amiga was.


1648
01:32:48.725 --> 01:32:50.685
And just smart things
about doing things like,


1649
01:32:50.765 --> 01:32:53.285
"We're gonna make it so we
have a hardware mouse cursor,"


1650
01:32:53.725 --> 01:32:56.725
to me, it's the small things which
just show the genius of the team.


1651
01:32:56.805 --> 01:32:59.925
There were suddenly all kinds of
games that were made possible


1652
01:33:00.005 --> 01:33:04.365
by not being restricted by just the eight
cardinal directions on a joystick.


1653
01:33:04.445 --> 01:33:07.085
The ability just to navigate
a mouse around the screen


1654
01:33:07.165 --> 01:33:09.325
just opened up all kinds
of new possibilities.


1655
01:33:25.805 --> 01:33:28.805
Up until that point, I think the
transition from 8 to 16-bit


1656
01:33:28.885 --> 01:33:32.205
was the last generational
leap that we saw


1657
01:33:32.285 --> 01:33:35.565
that really allowed new
types of games to emerge.


1658
01:33:35.645 --> 01:33:38.365
Populous would not have been
possible on the Commodore 64.


1659
01:33:38.485 --> 01:33:40.085
I don't think
The Secret of Monkey Island


1660
01:33:40.165 --> 01:33:41.885
would have been possible
on the Commodore 64.


1661
01:33:42.085 --> 01:33:45.925
It revolutionised the way that
graphics looked in computer games


1662
01:33:46.005 --> 01:33:47.045
overnight, literally.

1663
01:33:48.205 --> 01:33:52.165
And it gave us so many
options and so many new ways


1664
01:33:52.245 --> 01:33:56.845
to look at how you could
realise a scene in a game.


1665
01:33:57.005 --> 01:34:00.165
It opened up all
kinds of avenues


1666
01:34:00.245 --> 01:34:03.205
to cinematic storytelling
and cutscenes


1667
01:34:03.285 --> 01:34:05.719
and all kinds of things
that we could do in a game,


1668
01:34:05.744 --> 01:34:07.429
that you could never do before.

1669
01:34:36.445 --> 01:34:39.645
It pushed game development,

1670
01:34:39.725 --> 01:34:42.165
it give it a rocket booster,

1671
01:34:42.245 --> 01:34:45.365
it give a nitro booster, and
pushed game development.


1672
01:34:45.445 --> 01:34:49.165
It accelerated ideas, people
wanting to get to work on games,


1673
01:34:49.245 --> 01:34:50.805
what you could actually do.

1674
01:34:50.885 --> 01:34:52.565
You could actually do a
lot more with a game.


1675
01:34:52.645 --> 01:34:56.005
It was such a leap
in technology,


1676
01:34:56.085 --> 01:35:01.685
even today, I find anyone who slags
off the Amiga needs a head test.


1677
01:35:01.765 --> 01:35:05.445
Because it was such a great machine.
It really was.


1678
01:35:50.925 --> 01:35:54.405
It wasn't hardship. I did
have a lot of passion for it,


1679
01:35:54.525 --> 01:35:57.565
but you weren't surviving
on passion and coffee.


1680
01:35:57.645 --> 01:36:00.045
You could actually come in
at the start of the day,


1681
01:36:00.125 --> 01:36:03.405
have some ideas in your head and you
could realise it without being stressed.


1682
01:36:03.485 --> 01:36:05.125
And that frees up...

1683
01:36:06.245 --> 01:36:09.445
Or that sort of freedom, rather,
enables you to be more creative,


1684
01:36:09.525 --> 01:36:14.165
and to push beyond just fighting against
tools and fighting against hardware.


1685
01:36:14.245 --> 01:36:16.965
You can get to where you
expected to be pretty quickly,


1686
01:36:17.045 --> 01:36:18.485
and then you can go beyond that.

1687
01:36:18.565 --> 01:36:22.445
On an Amiga, you had your mouse,
keyboard, you'd be drawing, fantastic.


1688
01:36:23.445 --> 01:36:27.685
So you've got this bigger resolution,
more colours and a palette.


1689
01:36:27.765 --> 01:36:30.925
On the 64, you had 16
colours, that was it.


1690
01:36:31.005 --> 01:36:33.525
On an Amiga, 4,096 colours.

1691
01:36:33.925 --> 01:36:37.085
Fantastic. "What colours do I need?
I'm spoilt for choice."


1692
01:36:37.165 --> 01:36:40.405
I wanted to make as many games
for the Amiga as possible.


1693
01:36:40.925 --> 01:36:44.085
And of course, we had a lot
of our own ideas for games.


1694
01:36:44.165 --> 01:36:47.085
We even went back to
our development tools,


1695
01:36:47.565 --> 01:36:51.245
and our development tools
were, at that time, PC-based.


1696
01:36:51.325 --> 01:36:54.249
And we had a really
nice Paintbox program


1697
01:36:54.274 --> 01:36:56.709
that our developers used on the PC

1698
01:36:56.765 --> 01:36:59.805
to do the graphic art
that went into the games.


1699
01:36:59.885 --> 01:37:03.045
And Tim Mott, who's a
really brilliant guy


1700
01:37:03.125 --> 01:37:06.765
that ran the technology side of
Electronic Arts for nine years,


1701
01:37:06.845 --> 01:37:09.861
it was his idea that we
take that Paintbox product


1702
01:37:09.886 --> 01:37:12.309
and turn it into a
consumer product,


1703
01:37:12.365 --> 01:37:13.965
Deluxe Paint,

1704
01:37:14.045 --> 01:37:18.246
which was easily the most
popular painting app


1705
01:37:18.326 --> 01:37:21.206
in the mid-1980s on any machine.

1706
01:37:21.446 --> 01:37:23.006
And it was very
commercially successful


1707
01:37:23.086 --> 01:37:24.886
because it was just so much
fun to screw around with it,


1708
01:37:24.966 --> 01:37:28.326
even if you weren't an artist or had
no professional reason to be using it.


1709
01:37:28.926 --> 01:37:33.486
Deluxe Paint came out for the Amiga and
it absolutely changed our industry.


1710
01:37:33.766 --> 01:37:35.286
We'd never seen
anything like it.


1711
01:37:35.366 --> 01:37:38.004
The idea that you could
grab an area of the screen


1712
01:37:38.029 --> 01:37:40.150
and pick it up and
use it as a brush

1713
01:37:40.286 --> 01:37:42.046
was, frankly, astounding.

1714
01:37:42.206 --> 01:37:45.246
Nothing close to that, technically,
had ever been achieved.


1715
01:37:45.326 --> 01:37:48.326
You were watching it, not
actually believing your eyes


1716
01:37:48.406 --> 01:37:51.326
that you were able to
paint with a real bitmap.


1717
01:37:51.406 --> 01:37:52.886
It was just stunning.

1718
01:37:52.966 --> 01:37:56.246
It knew that I wanted to be able to
select things, cut and paste things,


1719
01:37:56.326 --> 01:37:59.046
move them around, change
colours once I put them down.


1720
01:37:59.126 --> 01:38:01.846
DPaint and the Amiga
was a real change.


1721
01:38:01.926 --> 01:38:05.766
I'm using this magical device
called a mouse. Brilliant.


1722
01:38:05.846 --> 01:38:07.246
You'd move it around the
screen and it's great.


1723
01:38:07.326 --> 01:38:08.926
You'd just click and
put your colour down.


1724
01:38:09.006 --> 01:38:14.286
Yeah, so first thing I did at Bitmaps
was Amiga, DPaint, Speedball 2.


1725
01:38:14.406 --> 01:38:15.446
Deluxe Paint came out

1726
01:38:15.526 --> 01:38:18.406
about halfway through my development
time on Defender of the Crown,


1727
01:38:18.486 --> 01:38:22.766
and it was a tremendous boon being
able to do things with brushes,


1728
01:38:22.846 --> 01:38:24.966
with sweeping brushes
and things like that,


1729
01:38:25.046 --> 01:38:28.606
that you couldn't do with
Graphicraft or Aegis Images.


1730
01:38:29.086 --> 01:38:34.526
You could do arcs and circles and
all kinds of interesting things.


1731
01:38:34.606 --> 01:38:38.566
You could tint, all kinds of effects
that you couldn't do before.


1732
01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:43.166
So that really speeded things
up during the development


1733
01:38:43.246 --> 01:38:44.726
and made things a lot easier.

1734
01:38:44.806 --> 01:38:46.246
And one of the great things
about Deluxe Paint was,


1735
01:38:46.326 --> 01:38:48.966
it was one of the first-ever packages
that had built-in animation.


1736
01:38:49.046 --> 01:38:52.726
You could set on
just a few frames,


1737
01:38:52.806 --> 01:38:55.046
make this little
character animate,


1738
01:38:55.126 --> 01:38:58.806
pick it up as a brush and then just
play the animation and play the brush.


1739
01:38:58.886 --> 01:39:01.246
So that it just put down
reams of these sprites.


1740
01:39:01.326 --> 01:39:04.766
And then, cos I was bored, I drew a
gun at the other end shooting them.


1741
01:39:04.846 --> 01:39:08.046
And that's where you start going, "Well,
that's funny, there's a game in that."


1742
01:39:08.126 --> 01:39:10.286
They give you DPaint,
you can export files,


1743
01:39:10.366 --> 01:39:13.206
you can incorporate those
into programs you're coding.


1744
01:39:13.286 --> 01:39:16.406
And it accelerates the rate of
development and productivity


1745
01:39:16.486 --> 01:39:19.206
of people who want to get into the
machine to use it for something.


1746
01:39:19.326 --> 01:39:25.086
It allowed me, who couldn't
draw to save his life,


1747
01:39:25.166 --> 01:39:28.046
allowed me to do
things on the screen,


1748
01:39:28.126 --> 01:39:31.766
and do them immediately, and
see the results immediately.


1749
01:39:31.886 --> 01:39:34.166
What Deluxe Paint allowed

1750
01:39:34.246 --> 01:39:38.166
was non-experts,
non-computer-experts,


1751
01:39:38.246 --> 01:39:41.806
people whose primary focus
was art and not technology,


1752
01:39:41.886 --> 01:39:44.326
to enter the domain of
video games creation.


1753
01:39:44.526 --> 01:39:46.166
It was a huge jump

1754
01:39:46.246 --> 01:39:49.646
moving from graphics on the
Commodore 64 to graphics on the Amiga.


1755
01:39:49.726 --> 01:39:52.681
It was like we'd missed
out one generation


1756
01:39:52.706 --> 01:39:55.110
and jumped to the next generation.

1757
01:39:55.206 --> 01:39:56.966
And it was fantastic.

1758
01:39:57.206 --> 01:39:59.486
It was a very powerful
piece of software,


1759
01:39:59.566 --> 01:40:01.957
and a lot of the effects you
see in modern-day software,


1760
01:40:01.982 --> 01:40:03.030
Photoshop and so on,

1761
01:40:03.086 --> 01:40:07.486
some of those effects appeared
first on Deluxe Paint.


1762
01:40:07.566 --> 01:40:11.366
So that just became the
ubiquitous piece of software


1763
01:40:11.446 --> 01:40:13.846
that we all used for
creating our sprites.


1764
01:40:14.006 --> 01:40:15.766
I loved the graphics
of the Amiga


1765
01:40:15.846 --> 01:40:18.486
for the games, for everything,
for the graphical tools,


1766
01:40:18.566 --> 01:40:23.766
but I got very caught up in the sound.
I absolutely loved the sound.


1767
01:40:56.006 --> 01:40:58.406
At the most basic level,
you had sampling.


1768
01:40:58.486 --> 01:41:02.446
Before that, it had all been synthesis,
albeit quite good synthesis,


1769
01:41:02.526 --> 01:41:04.246
on, say, the Commodore 64.

1770
01:41:04.326 --> 01:41:05.446
So, the Amiga was sampling.

1771
01:41:05.526 --> 01:41:11.046
And the Amiga had four sampling
voices, with 8-bit resolution,


1772
01:41:11.126 --> 01:41:13.326
and a lot more
memory, obviously.


1773
01:41:13.406 --> 01:41:17.046
So it opened up a new whole
way of creative freedom.


1774
01:41:17.126 --> 01:41:20.246
The only other alternative to
audio engineer on the Amiga


1775
01:41:20.326 --> 01:41:24.806
would be something like the
Akai S900 or S950 samplers,


1776
01:41:24.886 --> 01:41:26.566
or, of course, you
had the Fairlight.


1777
01:41:26.646 --> 01:41:29.686
Both of them cost thousands
of pounds at the time.


1778
01:41:29.766 --> 01:41:33.486
So, to buy an Amiga, you were
not only saving a lot of money,


1779
01:41:33.566 --> 01:41:38.406
it was enabling you to do things you
couldn't otherwise even dream of.


1780
01:41:38.606 --> 01:41:41.537
It was really bringing
professional sampling technology


1781
01:41:41.562 --> 01:41:43.550
into the hands of
everyday users.


1782
01:41:49.526 --> 01:41:53.206
Whenever I bought a new CD, I would
always sample it from beginning to end.


1783
01:41:53.286 --> 01:41:55.806
Whenever there was one
instrument exposed...


1784
01:41:55.886 --> 01:41:59.966
"The snare drum right there is exposed.
Shit, let's sample it."


1785
01:42:00.046 --> 01:42:04.407
So I would use AudioMaster to sample it,
and then I would put it in Soundtracker.


1786
01:42:05.007 --> 01:42:07.127
And I would be able to
use that snare drum.


1787
01:42:07.407 --> 01:42:10.367
Just like DJs use samplers
and all this kind of stuff.


1788
01:42:24.247 --> 01:42:26.847
We would put drums in
one of the channels,


1789
01:42:26.927 --> 01:42:30.167
the bass in another channel,
the melody in the third channel,


1790
01:42:30.247 --> 01:42:33.591
and even then, you'd have a
fourth channel for sprinkles


1791
01:42:33.616 --> 01:42:35.551
to enrich your arrangements.

1792
01:42:41.647 --> 01:42:44.647
You could not only sample drum sounds

1793
01:42:44.727 --> 01:42:47.807
and, essentially, any instrument
that you can think of,


1794
01:42:48.247 --> 01:42:50.047
but you could also sample chords.

1795
01:42:50.527 --> 01:42:55.087
So you could enhance the four channels
into more, because you would just...


1796
01:42:55.167 --> 01:42:59.487
Major chord, minor chord, and then
play that over different keys,


1797
01:42:59.567 --> 01:43:04.687
and you already have something with
one voice that sounds a lot bigger.


1798
01:43:13.807 --> 01:43:16.607
The Amiga sound chip was
solely sample-based.


1799
01:43:17.007 --> 01:43:21.287
However, you can also
sample small waveforms.


1800
01:43:21.367 --> 01:43:24.567
So, for instance, composers like
David Whittaker would do this a lot.


1801
01:43:24.927 --> 01:43:29.367
They would sample a series of square
waveforms with different widths to them


1802
01:43:29.447 --> 01:43:30.767
and then sequence them together.

1803
01:43:30.847 --> 01:43:33.767
And they could create quite rich
synthesised sounds like that.


1804
01:43:44.687 --> 01:43:48.487
What it facilitated was not
just people like Rob Hubbard,


1805
01:43:48.567 --> 01:43:50.887
who was a musician first
and a programmer second,


1806
01:43:50.967 --> 01:43:52.447
and not just people like me,

1807
01:43:52.527 --> 01:43:54.967
who is a programmer first
and a musician second.


1808
01:43:55.047 --> 01:43:57.007
But it allowed people who
weren't programmers at all,


1809
01:43:57.087 --> 01:43:58.887
had no programming ability,

1810
01:43:58.967 --> 01:44:03.567
to use an application like a tracker
to create amazing original works.


1811
01:44:03.647 --> 01:44:06.287
Soundtracker and ProTracker
and NoiseTracker,


1812
01:44:06.367 --> 01:44:08.127
that series of
programs, came out.


1813
01:44:08.207 --> 01:44:11.647
It enabled people who weren't
really educated musicians,


1814
01:44:11.727 --> 01:44:14.167
they couldn't read notes,
couldn't read sheet music,


1815
01:44:14.247 --> 01:44:16.007
enabled them to write music.

1816
01:44:16.207 --> 01:44:19.167
Because all they had to do was
put the notes in patterns,


1817
01:44:19.247 --> 01:44:23.047
which they could understand so
much easier than sheet music.


1818
01:44:23.127 --> 01:44:27.167
So it lowered the threshold for new
people to come in and create music.


1819
01:44:27.247 --> 01:44:29.927
The Soundtracker program
from Karsten Obarski


1820
01:44:30.007 --> 01:44:32.127
was a revolutionary
program for me.


1821
01:44:32.447 --> 01:44:35.287
You could actually control
the sound channels proper.


1822
01:44:35.367 --> 01:44:37.260
And do some tricks and hacks

1823
01:44:37.285 --> 01:44:41.071
just to make it sound bigger
than it actually was.


1824
01:44:41.127 --> 01:44:45.847
Because you had frame-by-frame
control of the sounds,


1825
01:44:45.927 --> 01:44:48.767
which was pretty
cool in those days.


1826
01:44:52.207 --> 01:44:56.327
With Rocket Ranger, the fist fight against
the Nazi guard was not a lot of fun.


1827
01:44:56.407 --> 01:45:00.287
But we had a sound guy, and
he stayed up late one night


1828
01:45:00.367 --> 01:45:03.287
and recorded sounds from
an old John Wayne movie,


1829
01:45:03.367 --> 01:45:05.687
digitised them and put
them into the game.


1830
01:45:05.767 --> 01:45:08.287
And all of a sudden, you'd
hit that Nazi guard


1831
01:45:08.367 --> 01:45:11.527
and you would hear something that
sounded like a John Wayne movie.


1832
01:45:11.607 --> 01:45:13.047
And it felt like you
were in the movie.


1833
01:45:13.127 --> 01:45:17.207
The sound effect made that whole
sequence so much more fun to play.


1834
01:45:21.807 --> 01:45:25.527
I think this was probably
one of the key moments


1835
01:45:25.607 --> 01:45:30.607
when the music started to really lean
in as a part of the valuable content.


1836
01:45:30.687 --> 01:45:34.087
Now, music in previous games, I'm not,
by any means, saying wasn't good.


1837
01:45:34.167 --> 01:45:37.007
I used to love a lot
of Commodore 64 music.


1838
01:45:37.087 --> 01:45:41.087
But what I'm saying is, on the hardware
level, it just became a point where,


1839
01:45:41.167 --> 01:45:44.807
"We've got to really put a lot of
attention on the music as well."


1840
01:45:44.887 --> 01:45:46.127
I remember Starglider.

1841
01:45:46.207 --> 01:45:47.447
Starglider

1842
01:45:47.527 --> 01:45:48.967
Yeah, we're singing
now, aren't we?


1843
01:45:49.167 --> 01:45:53.087
Starglider

1844
01:45:54.847 --> 01:45:57.207
I remember Starglider
having that sample,


1845
01:45:57.327 --> 01:46:00.687
which actually used a huge amount of
memory, but just for that one thing.


1846
01:46:00.767 --> 01:46:03.167
But it was very cool, very
impactful at the time.


1847
01:46:03.247 --> 01:46:06.007
By Rainbird

1848
01:46:06.087 --> 01:46:10.167
Here's just another example of the extra
memory and the faster processing power,


1849
01:46:10.247 --> 01:46:14.607
just allows you to make quite a leap up
in the quality of what you're doing.


1850
01:46:14.687 --> 01:46:20.207
It was amazing. To us, it
sounded full, powerful, varied.


1851
01:46:20.287 --> 01:46:22.607
You could do all
sorts of sounds.


1852
01:46:22.687 --> 01:46:26.047
From the techno music,
blippity-blop stuff,


1853
01:46:26.127 --> 01:46:29.567
to full arrangements, sampled
guitars, everything.


1854
01:46:29.647 --> 01:46:30.967
It was amazing.

1855
01:46:31.047 --> 01:46:35.607
And so, it was an introduction
into the world of sampling.


1856
01:46:35.687 --> 01:46:40.447
And I think that's really something that
Amiga can take a lot of credit for.


1857
01:46:40.527 --> 01:46:45.767
The sampling phenomenon really, for
me at least, started with the Amiga.


1858
01:46:45.847 --> 01:46:50.448
For me, it was the dream
of realising my music


1859
01:46:50.528 --> 01:46:53.328
in the way I
had it in my head.

1860
01:46:53.888 --> 01:46:57.368
That was possible finally
with the Commodore Amiga.


1861
01:47:13.168 --> 01:47:17.528
One of the interesting developments
from launching the Amiga


1862
01:47:17.608 --> 01:47:22.288
and all the marketing activities that we
did was the growth in the pirate market.


1863
01:47:22.368 --> 01:47:24.448
Well, piracy, of course,
was a major problem,


1864
01:47:24.528 --> 01:47:26.848
and it's what drove me out
of the Commodore 64 market


1865
01:47:26.928 --> 01:47:29.168
and into the Amiga, initially.

1866
01:47:29.528 --> 01:47:32.448
And then became very
widespread on the Amiga.


1867
01:47:32.528 --> 01:47:36.288
In Germany, software piracy,

1868
01:47:36.368 --> 01:47:38.768
was rampant, absolutely rampant.

1869
01:47:38.848 --> 01:47:41.488
And I don't know why, but
it's quite the phenomenon


1870
01:47:41.568 --> 01:47:43.531
that Germans and, I believe,

1871
01:47:43.556 --> 01:47:47.272
Scandinavians tend to not
want to buy software.


1872
01:47:47.688 --> 01:47:49.688
And I never understood why.

1873
01:47:50.088 --> 01:47:54.928
So that means I got into pirated
games, pretty big time.


1874
01:47:55.008 --> 01:47:59.808
The people who were a bit more
clever, not only pirated games,


1875
01:47:59.888 --> 01:48:04.688
but they also programmed delicious
graphical and sound intros.


1876
01:48:04.768 --> 01:48:09.288
The cracktros, originally, were
this rebellious way of proving


1877
01:48:09.368 --> 01:48:10.688
how good you were at programming

1878
01:48:10.768 --> 01:48:13.208
and how good you were
at making cool effects.


1879
01:48:13.288 --> 01:48:17.408
Which you then put right in front
of your newest pirated game.


1880
01:48:18.408 --> 01:48:21.528
So, that's how pretty much
everybody in Europe started out.


1881
01:48:24.848 --> 01:48:28.208
This is going to be a
very, very big hit.


1882
01:48:28.288 --> 01:48:30.968
I think they did it mostly
just because they could,


1883
01:48:31.048 --> 01:48:34.168
as a challenge to themselves
and to the other hackers that,


1884
01:48:34.248 --> 01:48:36.128
"Who can do this first?
And who can do it right?"


1885
01:48:36.208 --> 01:48:39.168
They used the Amiga a lot more

1886
01:48:39.248 --> 01:48:43.328
and much more interestingly than
the games that then followed


1887
01:48:43.408 --> 01:48:47.208
after you clicked the left mouse
button and the actual game loaded.


1888
01:48:47.288 --> 01:48:51.568
And eventually it developed into this
competitive, creative demo scene,


1889
01:48:51.648 --> 01:48:54.488
where people were actually
just saying "Screw the games.


1890
01:48:54.568 --> 01:48:57.248
"We just want to make cool
effects and cool visuals."


1891
01:49:31.608 --> 01:49:33.528
Talking away

1892
01:49:34.408 --> 01:49:36.808
I don't know what I'm to say

1893
01:49:36.888 --> 01:49:39.568
I'll say it anyway

1894
01:49:39.848 --> 01:49:43.208
Today's another day to find you

1895
01:49:43.288 --> 01:49:46.008
Shying away

1896
01:49:46.088 --> 01:49:48.648
I'll be coming for
your love, OK?


1897
01:49:48.728 --> 01:49:52.848
Take on me

1898
01:49:52.928 --> 01:49:54.328
Take on me

1899
01:49:54.408 --> 01:49:58.568
Take me on

1900
01:49:58.648 --> 01:49:59.888
Take on me

1901
01:49:59.968 --> 01:50:04.248
I'll be gone

1902
01:50:04.328 --> 01:50:07.088
In a day or two

1903
01:50:07.168 --> 01:50:09.968
They just did amazing
things with the technology.


1904
01:50:10.048 --> 01:50:11.488
Some of the demos,

1905
01:50:11.568 --> 01:50:15.848
where you'd have spinning 3D objects
and incredible artwork in them,


1906
01:50:15.928 --> 01:50:19.688
is just an excellent creation that
these programmers were making.


1907
01:50:22.968 --> 01:50:27.888
The roots of the demo scene was in
hundreds of thousands of bedrooms


1908
01:50:28.208 --> 01:50:31.848
and the guys sitting on their
computers, making stuff.


1909
01:50:31.928 --> 01:50:34.648
And it was a wonderful thing unlike
the later video games consoles


1910
01:50:34.728 --> 01:50:37.288
that you could program
them yourself at home.


1911
01:50:37.368 --> 01:50:38.728
So it really
encouraged creativity.


1912
01:50:38.808 --> 01:50:41.008
Now, whether you were inspired

1913
01:50:41.088 --> 01:50:44.408
to try and make a demo that was a
bit like another demo you'd seen,


1914
01:50:44.488 --> 01:50:46.808
or make a game that was a
bit like a game you'd seen,


1915
01:50:46.888 --> 01:50:48.528
it didn't really make
a lot of difference.


1916
01:50:48.608 --> 01:50:51.648
It was the fact that it was
possible for you to do it yourself


1917
01:50:51.728 --> 01:50:54.008
and you had this source of
inspiration all around.


1918
01:50:54.088 --> 01:50:56.928
These guys out in Finland and Norway
and these guys in Scandinavia


1919
01:50:57.008 --> 01:51:00.728
are doing these insane demos that I think
were really, really pushing the envelope


1920
01:51:00.808 --> 01:51:02.848
of what the Amiga
was capable of.


1921
01:51:02.928 --> 01:51:06.728
I quite often saw the
Fred Fish disks.


1922
01:51:06.808 --> 01:51:08.114
They weren't so much demos,

1923
01:51:08.139 --> 01:51:11.232
they were more utilities and
tools and all the rest of it,


1924
01:51:11.288 --> 01:51:13.608
which he used to build
things and they were great.


1925
01:51:13.688 --> 01:51:17.208
They were fantastic for learning
more about the Amiga and coding


1926
01:51:17.288 --> 01:51:19.088
and other things
that you could do


1927
01:51:19.168 --> 01:51:22.888
and other aspects to the
actual computer itself.


1928
01:51:22.968 --> 01:51:26.024
Whereas, I think in Europe
there was more of a clamour


1929
01:51:26.049 --> 01:51:27.992
for the demos and the graphics

1930
01:51:28.048 --> 01:51:30.168
and the audio, really, and the
entertainment side of it.


1931
01:51:30.608 --> 01:51:33.288
We had public domain software.

1932
01:51:33.368 --> 01:51:34.808
That was just
distributed by disk.


1933
01:51:34.888 --> 01:51:37.729
We didn't have the World Wide Web. We
didn't have any of that sort of thing.


1934
01:51:37.809 --> 01:51:42.129
So, it was literally people just buying
it via mail order and getting them home.


1935
01:51:42.369 --> 01:51:46.329
The first time you ever see a picture
that you've done and submitted it,


1936
01:51:46.409 --> 01:51:48.809
and seeing it in a
gallery, in a magazine,


1937
01:51:48.889 --> 01:51:51.729
that was just my proudest day.

1938
01:51:51.809 --> 01:51:53.009
So I just kept on doing it.

1939
01:51:53.089 --> 01:51:54.929
I couldn't get it
out there enough.


1940
01:51:55.929 --> 01:52:00.369
I guess that just got noticed and
started getting people asking


1941
01:52:00.449 --> 01:52:03.569
if I could do pictures
for their whatever.


1942
01:52:03.649 --> 01:52:04.431
And, in all frankness,

1943
01:52:04.456 --> 01:52:06.553
I didn't even know what the
demo scene was back then.


1944
01:52:06.809 --> 01:52:09.129
The demo scene was a
place to be creative.


1945
01:52:09.329 --> 01:52:11.449
There was just that.

1946
01:52:11.529 --> 01:52:13.689
Creativity, that's
what it was all about.


1947
01:52:13.769 --> 01:52:16.489
There's was no, "But we
have to finish this game,"


1948
01:52:16.569 --> 01:52:20.969
or, "This music has to fit
this scene in a movie,"


1949
01:52:21.049 --> 01:52:23.729
or, "It has to fit that
scene in a TV show,"


1950
01:52:23.809 --> 01:52:25.689
or, "It has to fit
this scene in a game."


1951
01:52:26.249 --> 01:52:27.929
It was whatever we
wanted it to be.


1952
01:52:28.009 --> 01:52:32.489
The first demo, I was very much
just proving myself as a programmer


1953
01:52:32.569 --> 01:52:37.289
and trying to make a first demo
that was really well constructed.


1954
01:52:37.369 --> 01:52:40.014
I suppose one way to look at it
is it's much like graffiti art,


1955
01:52:40.039 --> 01:52:41.113
quality graffiti art.

1956
01:52:41.169 --> 01:52:43.609
That, to me, is what it is
for the games industry.


1957
01:52:43.689 --> 01:52:46.849
That is like the graffiti
artists, but they're using demos.


1958
01:52:46.929 --> 01:52:49.169
It was absolutely stunning.
It was breathtaking,


1959
01:52:49.249 --> 01:52:50.929
some of the stuff they
would come out with.


1960
01:52:51.009 --> 01:52:53.292
And yet, a lot of them
weren't that bothered


1961
01:52:53.317 --> 01:52:55.193
about being commercially
successful.


1962
01:52:55.249 --> 01:52:57.689
They wouldn't want to
turn it into a game.


1963
01:52:58.249 --> 01:53:02.649
They just wanted to be known by a funny
name with an avatar or something


1964
01:53:02.729 --> 01:53:04.649
and be famous for
doing that demo.


1965
01:53:05.049 --> 01:53:07.049
We called ourselves IFF,

1966
01:53:07.129 --> 01:53:10.689
which was supposed to be short for
International Fart Federation.


1967
01:53:11.809 --> 01:53:14.849
We dropped that name
after maybe half a year


1968
01:53:14.929 --> 01:53:18.729
and decided to call us Crusaders
instead, after a bit of a vote.


1969
01:53:18.809 --> 01:53:22.649
One of the big things about the
demo scene versus games is that


1970
01:53:22.729 --> 01:53:27.569
creating a demo certainly didn't have
the complexities and difficulties


1971
01:53:27.649 --> 01:53:29.636
of actually building a game
that had to stand there


1972
01:53:29.661 --> 01:53:31.073
and not crash and anything else.

1973
01:53:31.529 --> 01:53:33.409
Most demos don't have AI,

1974
01:53:33.489 --> 01:53:36.809
they don't have considerations
about frameworks for the player


1975
01:53:36.889 --> 01:53:38.329
and everything else.

1976
01:53:38.409 --> 01:53:40.821
So, it's a completely different
thing that you're building


1977
01:53:40.846 --> 01:53:42.153
when you're building a demo

1978
01:53:42.209 --> 01:53:44.209
and you're building a game.

1979
01:53:44.289 --> 01:53:46.289
And, you know, you have the
luxury of irresponsibility.


1980
01:53:46.369 --> 01:53:48.489
They were all great sales
pieces for the Amiga.


1981
01:53:48.569 --> 01:53:51.649
If you had friends come over,
they wanted to see your Amiga,


1982
01:53:51.729 --> 01:53:53.009
you would often not
show them the games,


1983
01:53:53.089 --> 01:53:54.849
or not as much as you would
show them the demos.


1984
01:53:55.209 --> 01:53:57.649
Because they are of course completely
unencumbered by having to build


1985
01:53:57.729 --> 01:54:00.169
any kind of game or gameplay,

1986
01:54:00.249 --> 01:54:05.609
they could just go crazy with ray tracing
graphics and raster-based graphics


1987
01:54:05.689 --> 01:54:06.849
that they were able to create.

1988
01:54:07.169 --> 01:54:09.449
I remember the famous scrolling messages

1989
01:54:09.474 --> 01:54:11.753
that were constant shout outs to

1990
01:54:11.809 --> 01:54:15.369
various other cracking crews
around Scandinavia and Europe.


1991
01:54:15.449 --> 01:54:17.889
It was, "Hey, we
send our regards


1992
01:54:17.969 --> 01:54:21.929
"to these guys, these crews,
or these groups that we like."


1993
01:54:22.409 --> 01:54:24.449
Because we exchange stuff with
them or get demos with them.


1994
01:54:24.529 --> 01:54:28.929
And we said hey to these guys, which
made no sense at the time, really,


1995
01:54:29.009 --> 01:54:30.329
or now, when you look at it.

1996
01:54:30.529 --> 01:54:36.689
People would poke fun at each other,
but it was never anything serious.


1997
01:54:36.809 --> 01:54:42.809
It was all done in the spirit of the
demo scene, is how I like to put it.


1998
01:54:42.889 --> 01:54:47.489
The first demo I remember is, at
no surprise, is the Sodan demo,


1999
01:54:48.249 --> 01:54:50.696
which kind of showed a
lot of Amiga features


2000
01:54:50.721 --> 01:54:53.113
like dual-playfield and
everything that was


2001
01:54:53.169 --> 01:54:56.009
going on in that demo and
drawing lines, 3D graphics,


2002
01:54:56.089 --> 01:54:58.089
and it kind of blew me away
that they could do it,


2003
01:54:58.169 --> 01:55:00.409
because I hadn't got
that far at that point,


2004
01:55:00.489 --> 01:55:04.129
and it just got me even more interested
and wanted to learn more about


2005
01:55:04.209 --> 01:55:06.969
the Amiga chipset, so I could
do those things as well.


2006
01:55:07.329 --> 01:55:12.449
Kefrens and the Rebels, that made
some demos that inspired me.


2007
01:55:12.929 --> 01:55:16.729
Later on it would be Scoopex
and it would be Red Sector


2008
01:55:16.809 --> 01:55:20.369
and also, especially,
Phenomena from Sweden.


2009
01:55:20.889 --> 01:55:25.289
They had some amazing programmers
and especially musicians.


2010
01:55:25.609 --> 01:55:31.049
The guys from Crionics, working
with The Silents, Denmark,


2011
01:55:31.289 --> 01:55:35.569
on Hardwired, which was also one of
those demos that once it got put up


2012
01:55:35.649 --> 01:55:41.209
kind of moved the bar to a whole
different level for what people


2013
01:55:41.289 --> 01:55:43.409
now expected a demo to be.

2014
01:55:44.289 --> 01:55:48.649
The Budbrain Megademos, they were
great because they were very funny.


2015
01:55:49.009 --> 01:55:51.729
And there was a little bit
of a story to it as well.


2016
01:56:01.929 --> 01:56:02.929
Yo, check this out.

2017
01:56:11.329 --> 01:56:15.209
You know, my favourite demo of all
time is Mental Hangover by Scoopex.


2018
01:56:17.449 --> 01:56:21.889
You know, it was talking all about
drinking and being hungover,


2019
01:56:21.969 --> 01:56:24.649
and it had so much
attitude, you know?


2020
01:56:24.729 --> 01:56:28.650
We were kids, and we
expressed what we felt.


2021
01:56:28.730 --> 01:56:30.730
And that's what we were
feeling at the time.


2022
01:56:30.810 --> 01:56:33.010
We weren't feeling, "Let's
go make some money."


2023
01:56:33.090 --> 01:56:38.410
It was more about party or trying
to out-program each other.


2024
01:56:38.770 --> 01:56:43.930
The demos gave me freedom to actually
explore any side of myself, in composing.


2025
01:56:44.010 --> 01:56:48.010
Because you didn't have any
strict guidelines to hold on to.


2026
01:56:48.090 --> 01:56:52.650
It was actually a great time to learn,
you know, and explore yourself.


2027
01:56:58.210 --> 01:57:00.435
I was really excited about doing music

2028
01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:02.914
that somebody wanted
to use for something.


2029
01:57:02.970 --> 01:57:07.010
One this is to make a
cool-sounding music track,


2030
01:57:07.090 --> 01:57:11.330
but then to have that music track
put to some visual effects,


2031
01:57:11.410 --> 01:57:13.690
it makes the music sound
a lot cooler as well.


2032
01:57:14.170 --> 01:57:16.210
And it makes the visual
effects look better


2033
01:57:16.235 --> 01:57:18.274
when you add some cool
music to go with it.


2034
01:57:18.330 --> 01:57:21.050
So it's like they
enrich each other.


2035
01:57:26.210 --> 01:57:28.970
You could say that
there is a music style


2036
01:57:29.050 --> 01:57:31.570
that kind of is a
demo-scene music style.


2037
01:57:31.770 --> 01:57:34.610
I have not really
explored that scene much.


2038
01:57:34.690 --> 01:57:39.770
I was more interested in trying
to see how far I could push music


2039
01:57:39.850 --> 01:57:42.610
and mood, and to what
extremes I could push it.


2040
01:57:42.690 --> 01:57:49.610
And I think that's what I take
out and take with me to this day


2041
01:57:49.690 --> 01:57:54.530
try to create something you haven't
necessarily heard or try to innovate.


2042
01:57:54.610 --> 01:57:56.690
And do it as best I can.

2043
01:57:58.290 --> 01:58:00.010
Take four red capsules.

2044
01:58:00.090 --> 01:58:02.010
In 10 minutes, take two more.

2045
01:58:03.530 --> 01:58:07.010
The next step for me was
something called the demo party.


2046
01:58:07.490 --> 01:58:10.290
It was also called
the copy party,


2047
01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:13.450
because people went there to share
demos and share stuff that they had,


2048
01:58:13.530 --> 01:58:16.490
and also, let's be honest,

2049
01:58:16.570 --> 01:58:17.730
they went to copy games.

2050
01:58:17.810 --> 01:58:21.090
You basically rented a classroom
or two in schools to...


2051
01:58:21.170 --> 01:58:24.490
And it evolved from there, really,
it got bigger and bigger, obviously,


2052
01:58:24.930 --> 01:58:26.130
but at that time, that was it,

2053
01:58:26.155 --> 01:58:28.154
and it was just Commodore
Amigas everywhere.


2054
01:58:28.850 --> 01:58:34.610
The smell, the pungent smell,
almost like a mist in there.


2055
01:58:35.090 --> 01:58:39.570
It was like sweat and agony, and it's
just rows of computers everywhere.


2056
01:58:39.650 --> 01:58:41.254
We'd bring our sleeping bags

2057
01:58:41.279 --> 01:58:44.714
and stay over maybe something
like Saturday to Sunday.


2058
01:58:44.970 --> 01:58:46.770
There would be hundreds
of people there.


2059
01:58:46.850 --> 01:58:49.890
All swapping disks, copying
each other's stuff.


2060
01:58:50.050 --> 01:58:54.370
This was a way for people
that have been sending disks


2061
01:58:54.530 --> 01:58:57.090
and stuff like that to
actually meet in person.


2062
01:58:57.450 --> 01:59:00.130
And hang out, create
stuff together.


2063
01:59:00.450 --> 01:59:03.730
I remember the very first
demo party that we went to.


2064
01:59:03.810 --> 01:59:05.410
We called it a copy
party at the time.


2065
01:59:05.490 --> 01:59:10.130
There were, I don't know, 300,

2066
01:59:11.170 --> 01:59:14.770
And police showed up and
there was total panic,


2067
01:59:14.850 --> 01:59:16.410
there were people
jumping out windows.


2068
01:59:16.890 --> 01:59:18.330
Throwing disks out windows.

2069
01:59:18.970 --> 01:59:21.370
Crashing floppy disks
with their feet.


2070
01:59:21.450 --> 01:59:24.010
Trying to destroy evidence
of copying and stuff.


2071
01:59:24.130 --> 01:59:28.330
We were at one of my parties. Suddenly
the cops... Two cops show up.


2072
01:59:28.970 --> 01:59:33.330
And they say, "We hear you guys
have cracked games here and stuff".


2073
01:59:33.490 --> 01:59:36.010
And you know, the latest
games and stuff like that.


2074
01:59:36.090 --> 01:59:38.170
We're like, "It
might be possible."


2075
01:59:38.690 --> 01:59:42.650
They said, "So if I give you five disks,
can you put some of the latest games


2076
01:59:42.730 --> 01:59:44.410
"on there for me?"

2077
01:59:44.490 --> 01:59:46.930
I go, "I don't know, sure."

2078
01:59:47.090 --> 01:59:50.450
So the cop hands
me a pack of disks


2079
01:59:50.610 --> 01:59:52.290
and says, "I'll be
back in two hours.


2080
01:59:52.370 --> 01:59:55.330
"I would be grateful if you had some of
the latest games for my son on them."


2081
01:59:56.130 --> 01:59:58.370
Police still came and closed
down a lot of these parties.


2082
01:59:58.450 --> 02:00:01.090
What can you do, you know?

2083
02:00:01.210 --> 02:00:06.370
But that was the nature of it,
there was something a little bit


2084
02:00:06.730 --> 02:00:09.370
crazy about it, and we
weren't supposed to do it,


2085
02:00:09.530 --> 02:00:12.730
and we were often told that
these things could be shut down


2086
02:00:12.810 --> 02:00:16.010
by the police, and you know, don't
worry, just if it happens, it happens.


2087
02:00:16.250 --> 02:00:19.850
Somebody took a dump in some
other guy's sleeping bag.


2088
02:00:19.930 --> 02:00:22.290
He got scrubbed down.
Oh, my God.


2089
02:00:29.490 --> 02:00:32.770
There was definitely a big competitive
aspect to the demo scene.


2090
02:00:32.850 --> 02:00:36.530
I mean, the demo parties always had a
demo competition at the very end of it.


2091
02:00:36.970 --> 02:00:39.730
Where people showed off the latest
stuff that they'd been working on


2092
02:00:39.810 --> 02:00:40.810
for months.

2093
02:00:40.890 --> 02:00:45.050
Being number one, being most revered
was very much sought after.


2094
02:00:45.130 --> 02:00:47.690
Every group wanted
to be number one.


2095
02:00:47.850 --> 02:00:51.130
People would fill in a voting
form, send it to an address,


2096
02:00:51.210 --> 02:00:53.730
all of the information
was collated.


2097
02:00:53.810 --> 02:00:56.650
And the results were published
in the form of a demo


2098
02:00:56.970 --> 02:01:00.890
every month or two months, and this
was called the Crusaders Eurochart.


2099
02:01:01.290 --> 02:01:02.810
This was the spirit
of the demo scene.


2100
02:01:02.890 --> 02:01:05.690
Always trying to outdo each
other, always trying to innovate.


2101
02:01:05.890 --> 02:01:06.890
Always trying to
push things forward.


2102
02:01:07.090 --> 02:01:10.010
The technical achievements
these guys could accomplish


2103
02:01:10.090 --> 02:01:12.170
were like,
"How do they do that?"


2104
02:01:12.250 --> 02:01:13.781
Because we're developers,

2105
02:01:13.806 --> 02:01:17.355
and how do we incorporate
those effects into a game?


2106
02:01:17.451 --> 02:01:18.971
Can we use those
effects in a game?


2107
02:01:19.051 --> 02:01:21.411
So I think there was an
element of experimentation


2108
02:01:21.531 --> 02:01:23.691
that these guys did
to push the hardware.


2109
02:01:24.051 --> 02:01:25.971
To show other people
what you could do.


2110
02:01:27.331 --> 02:01:31.291
I think the games industry was
improved by the demo scene


2111
02:01:31.371 --> 02:01:34.091
for the simple reason that you
did see a lot of effects,


2112
02:01:34.171 --> 02:01:36.371
and you see a lot of techniques

2113
02:01:36.451 --> 02:01:40.651
that you probably wouldn't have come
up with unless you got inspired


2114
02:01:40.731 --> 02:01:41.731
from someone else doing it.

2115
02:01:42.251 --> 02:01:47.651
It's an interesting point to go
back and think about that era


2116
02:01:47.731 --> 02:01:49.771
in gaming history,
that Amiga era.


2117
02:01:49.851 --> 02:01:52.531
In that it did feel
very, very provincial.


2118
02:01:53.011 --> 02:01:56.571
And there was a very big difference
between what was happening in the UK


2119
02:01:56.651 --> 02:02:00.251
and in Europe, and what was
happening over in the USA.


2120
02:02:00.331 --> 02:02:03.091
And by the time we had
transitioned on to the Amiga,


2121
02:02:03.171 --> 02:02:05.891
America had really become
much more interested


2122
02:02:05.971 --> 02:02:07.611
in the Super Nintendo,

2123
02:02:07.691 --> 02:02:09.851
and the Sega Mega Drive.

2124
02:02:09.931 --> 02:02:11.451
Talk to an American
and ask them,


2125
02:02:11.531 --> 02:02:13.691
"What do you remember
about the 16-bit era?"


2126
02:02:13.971 --> 02:02:15.851
And they will say, "I
remember the Sega Genesis,"


2127
02:02:15.931 --> 02:02:17.491
"I remember the Super Nintendo."

2128
02:02:17.571 --> 02:02:20.771
If you ask a Brit what they
remember of the 16-bit era,


2129
02:02:20.851 --> 02:02:24.291
they will talk to you about the
Commodore Amiga, and the Atari ST.


2130
02:02:24.371 --> 02:02:28.291
So we had these two completely
different versions of the 16-bit era


2131
02:02:28.371 --> 02:02:29.771
on either side of the Atlantic.

2132
02:02:29.891 --> 02:02:33.811
And that's part of why, I think so many
of us, especially in Europe and in the UK


2133
02:02:33.891 --> 02:02:36.331
romanticise the
Amiga generation.


2134
02:02:36.451 --> 02:02:40.251
It's because it was the last time
that the games and the community


2135
02:02:40.331 --> 02:02:42.371
felt unique to us.

2136
02:02:42.451 --> 02:02:45.451
Before the global explosion
of gaming popularity


2137
02:02:45.531 --> 02:02:46.891
kind of brought
everyone into the mix.


2138
02:03:14.251 --> 02:03:16.371
When the Amiga 1000 came out...

2139
02:03:17.731 --> 02:03:19.611
Let me put it this way,

2140
02:03:21.051 --> 02:03:26.251
that's about the biggest surprise I
have every had in my entire career


2141
02:03:26.611 --> 02:03:28.291
in one single system.

2142
02:03:28.371 --> 02:03:30.811
It changed so many
things all at once.


2143
02:03:30.891 --> 02:03:34.251
I mean, and you ask somebody else,
they give you the same answer,


2144
02:03:34.331 --> 02:03:37.091
and give you five other
different examples.


2145
02:03:51.971 --> 02:03:54.933
I think it's quite simple
why people remember


2146
02:03:54.958 --> 02:03:57.275
the Amiga so fondly even today.

2147
02:03:57.331 --> 02:03:58.811
It's because it was
revolutionary.


2148
02:03:59.371 --> 02:04:02.251
When it came out, there
was nothing like it.


2149
02:04:02.371 --> 02:04:05.971
It wasn't a small step for
the computer generation,


2150
02:04:06.051 --> 02:04:07.611
it was a massive step.

2151
02:04:07.731 --> 02:04:09.091
This was the last machine

2152
02:04:10.571 --> 02:04:13.211
which had complicated hardware,
but it was understandable.


2153
02:04:13.291 --> 02:04:15.038
And it was documented to a level

2154
02:04:15.063 --> 02:04:17.955
where you could get down
to the individual bits


2155
02:04:18.011 --> 02:04:20.091
of hardware, you could
know everything about


2156
02:04:20.171 --> 02:04:21.971
that machine.

2157
02:04:22.051 --> 02:04:24.651
And it trained a whole
generation of people,


2158
02:04:24.731 --> 02:04:28.091
I mean, I don't think the entire
computer industry would have evolved


2159
02:04:28.171 --> 02:04:30.131
in quite the way, because
people who grew up with that


2160
02:04:30.211 --> 02:04:32.371
went on to do all the stuff
that is being done now.


2161
02:04:32.451 --> 02:04:34.291
The Amiga was the last...

2162
02:04:34.371 --> 02:04:38.291
The last time that you could just
really experiment and play around.


2163
02:04:38.371 --> 02:04:39.531
There were no real barriers.

2164
02:04:39.611 --> 02:04:44.771
And also the hardware itself, as I've
already spoken quite lovingly of,


2165
02:04:45.131 --> 02:04:48.771
was so flexible that it
allowed real experimentation,


2166
02:04:48.851 --> 02:04:52.571
and experimentation, actually, that I'm not
even sure the designers of the machine


2167
02:04:52.651 --> 02:04:53.651
had planned.

2168
02:04:54.051 --> 02:04:56.851
So you have the feeling
of empowerment.


2169
02:04:57.291 --> 02:05:02.491
To be able to do great things with
just that computer in front of you.


2170
02:05:02.571 --> 02:05:07.691
The first platform that allowed
people that were creative to get out


2171
02:05:07.771 --> 02:05:10.251
into the masses, and I just
enjoyed being a part of that.


2172
02:05:10.571 --> 02:05:12.971
The first time I saw
Jim Sachs' work,


2173
02:05:13.091 --> 02:05:16.811
I understood, immediately,
what the leap was.


2174
02:05:16.891 --> 02:05:20.491
The Amiga enabled that
entire revolution.


2175
02:05:20.611 --> 02:05:24.811
Not just graphically, but in the way
you could effectively tell a story,


2176
02:05:24.891 --> 02:05:27.011
and change the
gaming experience.


2177
02:05:27.131 --> 02:05:31.011
From one of just arcade quality, to
something a little more substantial.


2178
02:05:31.091 --> 02:05:34.251
Some of those early games, and
some of the immersive storytelling


2179
02:05:34.331 --> 02:05:35.611
that we were able to do

2180
02:05:35.691 --> 02:05:39.011
in some of those early games, I
think the repercussions of that,


2181
02:05:39.091 --> 02:05:42.691
the echoes of that are still
being heard, and felt today


2182
02:05:42.771 --> 02:05:44.491
in games that are
coming out now.


2183
02:05:44.611 --> 02:05:47.251
When people ask me why I am
still working in games...


2184
02:05:49.211 --> 02:05:52.451
It's that collaborative development
environment that you get


2185
02:05:52.531 --> 02:05:55.691
where you're working with artists,
coders, musicians, designers.


2186
02:05:55.771 --> 02:05:59.531
All in the same kind of framework, and
you're creating something together


2187
02:05:59.611 --> 02:06:02.572
that none of you as
individuals could create.


2188
02:06:02.652 --> 02:06:05.332
And it's probably the
Amiga that was the first


2189
02:06:05.412 --> 02:06:07.732
moment that happened
in my experience.


2190
02:06:08.132 --> 02:06:11.012
But once you got to the Amiga,
you could start to sell a game


2191
02:06:11.092 --> 02:06:12.692
on, "Look at these graphics."

2192
02:06:12.772 --> 02:06:17.332
And actually, the games industry
has spent the last 20 plus years


2193
02:06:17.412 --> 02:06:20.212
selling games in the
same sort of way.


2194
02:06:20.652 --> 02:06:24.012
The Amiga opened doors...

2195
02:06:25.812 --> 02:06:28.812
...for professionals

2196
02:06:30.052 --> 02:06:34.012
and professions in a way that I
don't think any other machine


2197
02:06:34.092 --> 02:06:36.092
has been able to emulate.

2198
02:06:36.852 --> 02:06:41.532
First it allowed the progression from
assembly language to C programming.


2199
02:06:41.612 --> 02:06:44.612
So programmers could afford
to be more high level,


2200
02:06:44.972 --> 02:06:48.852
and therefore, not nearly so
skilled on low level assembler.


2201
02:06:49.972 --> 02:06:54.212
The second thing it facilitated
was the entry of artists.


2202
02:06:54.292 --> 02:06:58.532
Whose primary focus was art and
not the creation of pixels.


2203
02:06:58.612 --> 02:07:02.492
And the third stream of
people it brought in


2204
02:07:02.572 --> 02:07:04.612
was musicians and composers.

2205
02:07:04.692 --> 02:07:08.063
People who could now
create music on a machine


2206
02:07:08.088 --> 02:07:10.956
that would more faithfully than not

2207
02:07:11.012 --> 02:07:13.812
allow them to realise
their efforts.


2208
02:07:14.052 --> 02:07:17.492
And we moved from a
hobbyist industry


2209
02:07:17.572 --> 02:07:20.692
to very much an industry
capable of professionalism.


2210
02:07:20.932 --> 02:07:24.212
I think that everybody of my
generation who was from Europe


2211
02:07:24.292 --> 02:07:26.812
and who is in the games
industry nowadays,


2212
02:07:26.892 --> 02:07:29.732
I would bet that they
came in via the Amiga.


2213
02:07:29.812 --> 02:07:33.812
Maybe initially, shortly,
briefly, the C64,


2214
02:07:33.972 --> 02:07:35.092
and the Atari ST,

2215
02:07:35.212 --> 02:07:37.732
but all of us moved on to
the Amiga very quickly,


2216
02:07:37.812 --> 02:07:39.252
and that's where
everybody flourished.


2217
02:07:39.332 --> 02:07:43.012
So it's absolutely crucial, and
you can ask all around the world.


2218
02:07:43.412 --> 02:07:45.692
In Japan, people would have
come via the consoles,


2219
02:07:45.772 --> 02:07:47.732
a little bit also
here in the US,


2220
02:07:47.812 --> 02:07:51.012
and the PC of course got
strong very quickly in the US.


2221
02:07:51.132 --> 02:07:55.092
But all of Europe, the game
industry veterans of today


2222
02:07:55.172 --> 02:07:56.892
have to thank the
Amiga tremendously.


2223
02:07:57.372 --> 02:08:00.572
I think it was a fundamental building
block for the modern games industry.


2224
02:08:00.692 --> 02:08:04.692
I think it was a point at which
everybody realised games could be


2225
02:08:04.772 --> 02:08:08.772
the massive business that they are
now, worth countless billions.


2226
02:08:08.852 --> 02:08:13.412
And I think it was wonderful to be
involved at the very early stages.


2227
02:08:13.492 --> 02:08:18.372
We had no clue whatsoever that the
industry would get as big as it is now.


2228
02:08:18.452 --> 02:08:20.412
It was more than
a games machine.


2229
02:08:20.492 --> 02:08:24.572
It was more than a computer, it
was many things for many people.


2230
02:08:24.652 --> 02:08:28.132
That's what made it special, I think.
You know?


2231
02:08:28.212 --> 02:08:33.292
So, it was special for us because we
could really show off our talents.


2232
02:08:33.372 --> 02:08:36.892
And, like I said, it
was special for people


2233
02:08:36.972 --> 02:08:39.692
because they could do amazing
things with it, you know,


2234
02:08:39.772 --> 02:08:43.172
in terms of music,
visuals, video editing.


2235
02:08:44.532 --> 02:08:47.532
That's the main
reason, I reckon.


2236
02:08:47.612 --> 02:08:53.212
It touched many different people
from many walks of lives.


2237
02:08:53.292 --> 02:08:55.092
We knew it was a great
graphics machine.


2238
02:08:55.172 --> 02:08:58.812
But we never saw the entire
desktop revolution coming.


2239
02:08:58.892 --> 02:09:03.452
We didn't realise that the Amiga
was going to be the device


2240
02:09:03.532 --> 02:09:07.492
that was powerful enough to
create this new industry.


2241
02:09:07.572 --> 02:09:13.252
These days, no one thinks twice about
editing video on their home computer,


2242
02:09:13.332 --> 02:09:14.772
but it was radical then,

2243
02:09:14.852 --> 02:09:17.532
it was the first machine that
allowed that kind of capability.


2244
02:09:17.612 --> 02:09:22.092
And the Amiga was designed so they
put out very good video quality


2245
02:09:22.172 --> 02:09:24.972
compared to all the other computers
that were in the market in terms of


2246
02:09:25.092 --> 02:09:28.692
the NTSC television signal
that came out of the Amiga


2247
02:09:28.772 --> 02:09:32.092
was very close to being
right on the spec.


2248
02:09:32.172 --> 02:09:35.812
So it allowed you to then
record that onto videotape


2249
02:09:35.892 --> 02:09:37.652
or to put it out over the air,

2250
02:09:37.732 --> 02:09:39.092
whatever you wanted
to do with it.


2251
02:09:39.172 --> 02:09:42.412
And that was right out of the Amiga
without any special equipment.


2252
02:09:42.492 --> 02:09:45.572
A lot of people use that
even without Video Toaster.


2253
02:09:45.652 --> 02:09:49.412
They used their Amigas for
creating video and creating audio.


2254
02:09:49.652 --> 02:09:52.012
As we speak,

2255
02:09:52.092 --> 02:09:57.292
a paradigm shift of equal magnitude
has grabbed the world of video.


2256
02:09:57.372 --> 02:09:59.332
A paradigm shift.

2257
02:09:59.412 --> 02:10:02.492
And the force behind the shift,

2258
02:10:02.572 --> 02:10:06.372
we at NewTek call
the Video Toaster.


2259
02:10:06.452 --> 02:10:07.652
Hey, that's a hot name.

2260
02:10:07.732 --> 02:10:10.852
We discovered that by
using the Amiga's video,


2261
02:10:10.932 --> 02:10:15.292
we could take advantage of all of the
Amiga's graphic scope processing.


2262
02:10:15.972 --> 02:10:17.812
The Copper and the blitter.

2263
02:10:17.892 --> 02:10:20.252
All these things, we weren't
making pictures with them,


2264
02:10:20.332 --> 02:10:22.572
we were making these
bizarre little barcodes


2265
02:10:22.652 --> 02:10:25.412
that would then control
the Video Toaster card.


2266
02:10:25.492 --> 02:10:28.292
And then there was a huge
phenomenon with 3D animation.


2267
02:10:28.372 --> 02:10:32.052
Because LightWave 3D
was just one of the,


2268
02:10:32.132 --> 02:10:34.452
what we call croutons,
in the Video Toaster,


2269
02:10:34.532 --> 02:10:36.452
these little squares
you click on.


2270
02:10:36.532 --> 02:10:38.372
It's a toast analogy.

2271
02:10:38.452 --> 02:10:40.492
Croutons, little
pieces of bread.


2272
02:10:40.572 --> 02:10:42.212
It's just my "rye"
sense of humour.


2273
02:10:42.292 --> 02:10:46.332
One of the croutons
was LightWave.


2274
02:10:46.412 --> 02:10:49.733
So you click on that,
and the screen opens up


2275
02:10:49.813 --> 02:10:51.893
into front, top, and side view,

2276
02:10:51.973 --> 02:10:53.773
and now you can make models,
you can light them,


2277
02:10:53.853 --> 02:10:56.453
and you can do 3D animation.

2278
02:10:56.533 --> 02:11:02.973
And a lot of people started to buy the
Video Toaster just for that reason.


2279
02:11:03.053 --> 02:11:06.893
And so Babylon 5,

2280
02:11:06.973 --> 02:11:11.013
SeaQuest DSV, a Spielberg show.

2281
02:11:12.493 --> 02:11:18.653
Examples of people taking LightWave,
building a big crew of animators,


2282
02:11:18.733 --> 02:11:22.573
and doing CGI on television,
which, up to that point,


2283
02:11:22.653 --> 02:11:24.053
was absolutely unthinkable.

2284
02:11:24.133 --> 02:11:25.573
The market moved up.

2285
02:11:27.853 --> 02:11:32.213
And around the time that the Amiga

2286
02:11:32.293 --> 02:11:34.533
was also the beginning
of the PC market.


2287
02:11:34.613 --> 02:11:37.093
PCs, they were business machines
and they were very expensive.


2288
02:11:37.173 --> 02:11:39.773
So, actually, for most people,
they couldn't even...


2289
02:11:39.853 --> 02:11:41.373
They couldn't aspire
to buying one.


2290
02:11:41.453 --> 02:11:43.373
You're talking
about ¬£1,000 plus.


2291
02:11:43.453 --> 02:11:45.613
Cos you know they're expensive,

2292
02:11:45.693 --> 02:11:48.613
and well made because
they had metal cases.


2293
02:11:48.693 --> 02:11:52.693
Whereas, of course, the home
PCs, they were made of plastic.


2294
02:11:52.773 --> 02:11:54.453
- So they weren't very serious things.
- And on occasions,


2295
02:11:54.533 --> 02:11:55.573
woodgrain plastic as well.

2296
02:11:55.653 --> 02:11:56.813
- Yes.
- Which was wonderful.


2297
02:11:56.893 --> 02:12:00.013
- I never quite understood that.
- The Atari VCS is beautiful.


2298
02:12:00.093 --> 02:12:02.613
Give the consumer confidence,
give them a plastic computer,


2299
02:12:02.693 --> 02:12:06.813
high-tech, but make sure it looks
like your grandad's gramophone.


2300
02:12:06.893 --> 02:12:09.253
And they weren't as popular
because, let's be honest about it,


2301
02:12:09.333 --> 02:12:13.413
the PCs could not deliver
what the Amiga could deliver.


2302
02:12:13.493 --> 02:12:15.493
In terms of graphics and sound,

2303
02:12:15.573 --> 02:12:17.533
and all those wonderful
things that we already know.


2304
02:12:17.613 --> 02:12:21.013
The PC was way behind
in technology terms.


2305
02:12:21.093 --> 02:12:24.893
I think it was difficult to make
games in the early days for PC.


2306
02:12:24.973 --> 02:12:27.413
- Yeah.
- Because the colour palettes


2307
02:12:27.493 --> 02:12:29.453
were just so incredibly awful.

2308
02:12:29.533 --> 02:12:30.733
There weren't really
colours, were there?


2309
02:12:30.813 --> 02:12:32.933
They were designed for
spreadsheet annotation.


2310
02:12:33.013 --> 02:12:35.613
Basically, the graphics cards
weren't graphics cards.


2311
02:12:35.693 --> 02:12:37.851
They were designed to
make spreadsheets,


2312
02:12:37.876 --> 02:12:39.717
and word processes easier to read.

2313
02:12:39.933 --> 02:12:42.693
You could have yellow letters
or you could have blue letters


2314
02:12:42.773 --> 02:12:43.853
- or green letters.
- Yeah.


2315
02:12:43.933 --> 02:12:44.933
I mean, that was
what it was for.


2316
02:12:45.013 --> 02:12:48.933
And then we were trying to, sort
of, hack that to make monsters,


2317
02:12:49.013 --> 02:12:50.813
and warriors, and all
that kind of stuff.


2318
02:12:50.893 --> 02:12:54.053
It was really about
the PC era of games.


2319
02:12:54.133 --> 02:12:56.893
Which coincides a lot
with the rise of Amiga.


2320
02:12:56.973 --> 02:13:02.413
And I think it was more getting out
of these specialised little machines,


2321
02:13:02.493 --> 02:13:05.733
like the Atari 800,
and the Commodore 64,


2322
02:13:05.813 --> 02:13:08.933
where things were moving
into actual real computers.


2323
02:13:09.013 --> 02:13:10.973
And the Amiga was
a real computer,


2324
02:13:11.053 --> 02:13:13.573
and the PC was a real computer,

2325
02:13:13.653 --> 02:13:17.413
and these things were making
their way into people's homes


2326
02:13:17.493 --> 02:13:19.733
for reasons other than gaming.

2327
02:13:19.813 --> 02:13:24.053
So, it's like we were getting into
people's homes in this stealth way.


2328
02:13:24.133 --> 02:13:26.773
They would buy their PC,
they would buy their Amiga


2329
02:13:26.853 --> 02:13:28.813
for some "serious" reason.

2330
02:13:28.893 --> 02:13:30.893
But they'd spend all their
time playing games on it.


2331
02:13:30.973 --> 02:13:34.253
So I do think it was actually a
very, very influential time,


2332
02:13:34.333 --> 02:13:35.533
just because of that.

2333
02:13:35.613 --> 02:13:40.013
Because a lot of these things were
moving into normal people's homes


2334
02:13:40.093 --> 02:13:42.933
for other reasons, and they
were being exposed to gaming.


2335
02:13:43.773 --> 02:13:47.413
Henry Rubin, who is the
vice-president of engineering,


2336
02:13:47.493 --> 02:13:51.653
really wanted Amigas to be able
to do some kind of PC emulation.


2337
02:13:52.093 --> 02:13:54.973
That's why we had that
PC emulation program


2338
02:13:55.053 --> 02:13:57.973
when the Amiga launched, even
though it was really, really slow


2339
02:13:58.053 --> 02:13:59.613
and not very useful.

2340
02:13:59.693 --> 02:14:01.053
The emulator.

2341
02:14:01.133 --> 02:14:05.813
Which turns your Amiga computer
into an IBM personal computer.


2342
02:14:09.933 --> 02:14:13.693
They wanted to be able to
sell Amigas into businesses.


2343
02:14:13.773 --> 02:14:17.053
And there was this
checkmark that said,


2344
02:14:17.133 --> 02:14:20.333
"Is it PC compatible to be able
to sell something in businesses?"


2345
02:14:20.413 --> 02:14:23.093
So, if I said I wanted
Amiga on my desk,


2346
02:14:23.173 --> 02:14:25.253
somebody's gonna
come along and say,


2347
02:14:25.333 --> 02:14:28.133
"You know, company requires you
to do all your documentation


2348
02:14:28.213 --> 02:14:31.853
"in Microsoft Word. So you
can't have that Amiga."


2349
02:14:31.933 --> 02:14:33.417
It was interesting because, obviously,

2350
02:14:33.442 --> 02:14:35.077
people were aware that
there was a market,


2351
02:14:35.133 --> 02:14:38.453
this machine was a market, but an
alternate way of it working...


2352
02:14:38.533 --> 02:14:41.173
There was that PC emulation
card, wasn't there?


2353
02:14:41.253 --> 02:14:44.453
The KCS Power Board,
I think it was.


2354
02:14:44.533 --> 02:14:45.973
Yeah, and that was
for the Amiga.


2355
02:14:46.053 --> 02:14:49.293
There was an interesting sort of hybrid.
You've got yourself an Amiga.


2356
02:14:49.373 --> 02:14:51.013
You actually want a PC.

2357
02:14:51.093 --> 02:14:53.253
So here's a board to plug
in to get yourself a PC.


2358
02:14:53.333 --> 02:14:56.173
PC emulator plugs into the
A500's RAM expansion.


2359
02:14:56.253 --> 02:14:58.493
Then, all of a sudden, I
have my Microsoft Word.


2360
02:14:58.573 --> 02:15:02.773
Here was a solution that allowed you
to get that Amiga into that business.


2361
02:15:02.853 --> 02:15:08.053
Which seems a bit counter-intuitive
now, but it led to great things.


2362
02:15:08.133 --> 02:15:12.613
And was the beginning of one
machine needing to work on another


2363
02:15:12.693 --> 02:15:13.813
and vice versa.

2364
02:15:13.893 --> 02:15:16.613
So it's the beginning of blurring
of the edges of PC technology,


2365
02:15:16.638 --> 02:15:17.557
Amiga technology,

2366
02:15:17.613 --> 02:15:18.813
and that kind of thing.

2367
02:15:18.893 --> 02:15:22.413
It's very hard to get across

2368
02:15:22.493 --> 02:15:25.533
the extent of the impact
the Amiga had on my life.


2369
02:15:29.013 --> 02:15:34.573
I think, had it not been for the Amiga,
I wouldn't be in the industry today.


2370
02:15:35.373 --> 02:15:38.014
I think, had it not
been for the Amiga,


2371
02:15:38.094 --> 02:15:41.454
I would not have started to
learn high-level languages.


2372
02:15:41.534 --> 02:15:46.134
I would not have started to get into
graphics and audio the way that I did.


2373
02:15:47.174 --> 02:15:49.734
I think, in a lot of ways,
because of the excitement,


2374
02:15:49.814 --> 02:15:53.814
because of that
profound step change


2375
02:15:53.894 --> 02:15:56.014
in what a machine could do,

2376
02:15:57.974 --> 02:16:04.414
it opened up life in a way that I
couldn't possibly imagine before.


2377
02:16:04.494 --> 02:16:06.574
It made me an optimist.

2378
02:16:06.654 --> 02:16:11.014
It made me realise that human beings
were capable of astounding leaps.


2379
02:16:12.134 --> 02:16:16.934
And it's very hard to get that
across without sounding ridiculous.


2380
02:16:17.774 --> 02:16:22.694
But it really was... People
wait for jetpacks, right?


2381
02:16:22.774 --> 02:16:26.454
People talk about flying cars.
The Amiga was that to me.


2382
02:16:26.534 --> 02:16:30.494
There are so many people just
starting to work on the Amiga again,


2383
02:16:30.574 --> 02:16:34.294
that there are lots of games,
new games, coming out right now


2384
02:16:34.374 --> 02:16:35.854
and the quality is so amazing,

2385
02:16:35.934 --> 02:16:39.454
it's even more amazing than
commercial games in the '80s.


2386
02:16:39.534 --> 02:16:43.974
The games industry on the
mobile phones is so destroyed,


2387
02:16:44.054 --> 02:16:46.847
that I actually think that
you can make more money


2388
02:16:46.872 --> 02:16:48.678
with an Amiga game right now

2389
02:16:48.734 --> 02:16:50.534
than you can do with
an iPhone game.


2390
02:16:50.614 --> 02:16:54.134
It was an incredible
culture at Amiga.


2391
02:16:54.214 --> 02:16:57.534
These guys... They were
firing on all cylinders.


2392
02:16:57.614 --> 02:17:00.054
You know, they were all friends.

2393
02:17:00.134 --> 02:17:02.654
The hardware guys worked
with the software guys.


2394
02:17:02.734 --> 02:17:07.134
It was kind of a small,
tightly knit team.


2395
02:17:07.614 --> 02:17:10.654
And you could just tell that
there was magic happening.


2396
02:17:10.734 --> 02:17:14.014
It was the thing that I loved
the most about the Amiga was,


2397
02:17:14.094 --> 02:17:18.814
it was this wild, galloping
horse the entire time.


2398
02:17:18.894 --> 02:17:23.134
And the best you could do
was ride that baby bareback


2399
02:17:23.214 --> 02:17:24.907
and hang on to the mane and hope

2400
02:17:24.932 --> 02:17:28.158
that we're all heading in the
right direction together.


2401
02:17:29.174 --> 02:17:34.414
It was insane. It was
passion, and love


2402
02:17:34.494 --> 02:17:37.454
and belief in things that
couldn't possibly come true,


2403
02:17:37.534 --> 02:17:40.254
and yet they were coming
true, month after month.


2404
02:17:40.334 --> 02:17:42.534
Things were working the
way that we hoped.


2405
02:17:42.614 --> 02:17:45.614
It was this crazy, crazy dream

2406
02:17:45.694 --> 02:17:50.734
that a bunch of us had and that we
actually managed to turn into reality.


2407
02:17:51.534 --> 02:17:54.854
For me, it was the
opportunity to create,


2408
02:17:54.934 --> 02:17:59.294
not just multi-tasking, but also
the architecture of the Amiga


2409
02:17:59.374 --> 02:18:02.814
with dynamically loadable
libraries and device drivers,


2410
02:18:02.894 --> 02:18:05.734
and the interrupt handlers,
and all of that architecture


2411
02:18:05.814 --> 02:18:09.054
that I created during that time

2412
02:18:09.134 --> 02:18:11.414
went on to be used by
so many other people.


2413
02:18:11.494 --> 02:18:14.614
It was like the basis
of design from then on.


2414
02:18:14.694 --> 02:18:19.494
It sort of established a
platform or a way of developing


2415
02:18:19.574 --> 02:18:21.014
all of the systems that
came in the future.


2416
02:18:21.094 --> 02:18:23.494
So it was one of the first
microcomputer systems


2417
02:18:23.574 --> 02:18:25.334
to really have that
kind of architecture.


2418
02:18:25.414 --> 02:18:26.934
All the stuff that
people have done


2419
02:18:27.014 --> 02:18:29.774
with the audio and the
graphics and the video,


2420
02:18:29.854 --> 02:18:33.374
I just really feel
that I'm lucky


2421
02:18:33.454 --> 02:18:35.894
to have been at the right place
and time to be a part of that.


2422
02:18:35.974 --> 02:18:37.614
So, that's very big.

2423
02:18:37.694 --> 02:18:39.054
And the friends I've made,

2424
02:18:39.134 --> 02:18:43.214
and I'm still in contact
with a lot of the people


2425
02:18:43.294 --> 02:18:45.574
that I worked with
during that time.


2426
02:18:45.654 --> 02:18:47.614
And that's been amazing, too.

2427
02:18:47.694 --> 02:18:53.094
I look back on my contribution to
the Amiga in several ways, I think.


2428
02:18:53.174 --> 02:18:56.414
The graphics, the bouncing ball,

2429
02:18:56.494 --> 02:19:00.334
the multi-tasking layer library.

2430
02:19:00.414 --> 02:19:03.574
But also, to a certain degree,

2431
02:19:03.654 --> 02:19:07.454
trying to instil in other
developers and other users


2432
02:19:07.534 --> 02:19:13.614
the magic that could be done if you're on
a mission from God with the right family.


2433
02:19:15.134 --> 02:19:20.414
And it was incredible working with
the people that I knew there.


2434
02:19:20.494 --> 02:19:24.134
And most... All of them are
still close friends of mine.


2435
02:19:24.214 --> 02:19:27.854
My Amiga family is gonna
be my family for life.


2436
02:19:27.934 --> 02:19:30.574
There have been questions
about what we believed


2437
02:19:30.654 --> 02:19:32.974
at the time when we
were doing the machine.


2438
02:19:33.054 --> 02:19:34.854
Did we think it was
gonna come true?


2439
02:19:34.934 --> 02:19:38.814
Did we feel a force to
push ourselves forward?


2440
02:19:38.894 --> 02:19:43.054
And the answer to that
is overpoweringly yes.


2441
02:19:43.134 --> 02:19:47.974
David Morse, president of the
company, was an amazing man.


2442
02:19:48.054 --> 02:19:53.174
Jay Miner, architect of the
basic system, an amazing man.


2443
02:19:53.254 --> 02:19:55.214
Dave Morse, our fearless leader,

2444
02:19:55.294 --> 02:19:59.174
he led us through all the
trials and tribulations.


2445
02:19:59.254 --> 02:20:01.534
He kept that flame alive.

2446
02:20:01.614 --> 02:20:07.294
There was some amazing power
behind those two guys


2447
02:20:07.374 --> 02:20:12.694
that pushed us forward
through no sleep, no money,


2448
02:20:12.774 --> 02:20:15.894
no time, no parts,

2449
02:20:15.974 --> 02:20:19.454
competition that would show
up from time to time...


2450
02:20:20.054 --> 02:20:24.695
All sorts of things that would get
in our way, parts that would break.


2451
02:20:24.775 --> 02:20:30.295
And we pushed forward because
we felt in our insides


2452
02:20:30.375 --> 02:20:34.175
how amazing this whole
machine was going to be.


2453
02:20:34.255 --> 02:20:38.455
And whatever spirit Dave and
Jay had inside of them fed us,


2454
02:20:38.535 --> 02:20:40.095
and pushed us forward.

2455
02:20:40.175 --> 02:20:41.655
It was amazing.

2456
02:20:41.735 --> 02:20:45.815
An Amiga serial
number 1 still works.


2457
02:20:45.895 --> 02:20:47.615
It still runs.

2458
02:20:48.855 --> 02:20:50.135
Magic.

2459
02:20:51.135 --> 02:20:55.375
You don't get an opportunity, very
often, to be at the very threshold,


2460
02:20:55.455 --> 02:20:59.495
the very beginning of a
billion-dollar-plus product line.


2461
02:20:59.575 --> 02:21:02.895
So I can look back and
say, "Hey, I was there.


2462
02:21:02.975 --> 02:21:05.815
"I was there when...
I walked in the door


2463
02:21:05.895 --> 02:21:10.655
"and we had two chairs, a card
table, and a coffeepot, and a dog."


2464
02:21:11.095 --> 02:21:14.375
Jay Miner had a dog.

2465
02:21:14.455 --> 02:21:16.695
Jay's dog was named Mitchy.

2466
02:21:16.775 --> 02:21:20.975
And Mitchy was the
mascot of the office.


2467
02:21:21.055 --> 02:21:26.455
And in the beginning days of the Amiga,
they designed the initial hardware


2468
02:21:26.535 --> 02:21:30.855
using pencils and
erasers and paper.


2469
02:21:30.935 --> 02:21:35.575
They would draw gates on the paper and
erase those gates and draw new ones,


2470
02:21:35.655 --> 02:21:37.855
and connect the lines together.

2471
02:21:37.935 --> 02:21:41.055
And this was state-of-the-art
of that day,


2472
02:21:41.135 --> 02:21:45.175
that you would design hardware
on paper with pencils.


2473
02:21:45.255 --> 02:21:48.815
And I would sit and watch Jay
Miner designing hardware.


2474
02:21:48.895 --> 02:21:52.775
And people say that it wasn't really
Jay that was the father of the Amiga,


2475
02:21:52.855 --> 02:21:54.135
that it was actually
Mitchy, his dog.


2476
02:21:54.215 --> 02:21:56.375
And I'm here to tell
you it's a true story.


2477
02:21:56.455 --> 02:21:57.495
I would watch.

2478
02:21:57.575 --> 02:22:00.775
Jay would sit there, and he'd
draw a gate on a sheet of paper,


2479
02:22:00.855 --> 02:22:03.695
and he'd look over at
Mitchy and Mitchy'd go...


2480
02:22:04.095 --> 02:22:07.095
And so he'd erase that and he'd draw it
upside down and with different lines,


2481
02:22:07.175 --> 02:22:08.295
and Mitchy'd go...

2482
02:22:09.015 --> 02:22:10.775
And so it was, "OK!" You know...

2483
02:22:13.895 --> 02:22:16.895
Amiga computer,
designed by a dog.


2484
02:23:48.335 --> 02:23:49.775
Where am I?

2485
02:25:08.975 --> 02:25:12.096
It is the best machine that is
around anywhere in the world.


2486
02:25:12.176 --> 02:25:13.616
The professional
machine of the future.


2487
02:25:23.656 --> 02:25:25.816
- How would I describe it?
- I think it's fantastic.


2488
02:25:25.896 --> 02:25:27.736
- Awesome.
- It's gonna skyrocket.


2489
02:25:27.816 --> 02:25:29.376
Only Amiga makes it possible.

2490
02:25:56.016 --> 02:26:00.816
Amiga's got the guts to do things
that you can't do on other hardware.


2491
02:26:00.896 --> 02:26:02.736
- And it does all the work for you.
- Wow.


2492
02:26:02.816 --> 02:26:05.456
State-of-the-art technology at a
price that everybody can afford.


2493
02:26:06.616 --> 02:26:10.576
The Amiga is the best
graphics machine available


2494
02:26:11.296 --> 02:26:12.536
in the world today.

2495
02:26:14.616 --> 02:26:15.656
Only Amiga.

2496
02:26:21.416 --> 02:26:22.456
Only Amiga.

2497
02:26:23.896 --> 02:26:24.896
Only Amiga.

2498
02:26:27.656 --> 02:26:28.656
Makes it possible.

2499
02:26:30.976 --> 02:26:32.696
Only Amiga makes it possible.

2500
02:26:36.576 --> 02:26:37.576
Outrageous.

2501
02:26:39.616 --> 02:26:40.616
Fabulous.

2502
02:26:47.336 --> 02:26:48.896
Only Amiga...

2503
02:26:48.976 --> 02:26:51.216
- This is it.
- ...makes it possible!


2504
02:26:59.936 --> 02:27:01.976
Well, it was in 1982,

2505
02:27:02.056 --> 02:27:05.536
a friend of mine that I
used to work with at Atari


2506
02:27:05.616 --> 02:27:06.816
came to me and said,

2507
02:27:06.896 --> 02:27:09.656
"Hey, Jay, let's start a new company.
I'm tired of this one."


2508
02:27:11.296 --> 02:27:15.056
And I said, "Well, fine." I said,
"I'll do the chips for it.


2509
02:27:15.136 --> 02:27:19.176
"And I'll be the vice president
if I can do the chips my way."


2510
02:27:19.736 --> 02:27:23.536
My original vision of the
machine was as a low-cost entry


2511
02:27:23.616 --> 02:27:28.936
into the computer field
via the video game area.


2512
02:27:29.016 --> 02:27:31.416
Video games, at that
time, were really hot,


2513
02:27:31.496 --> 02:27:34.216
and all our investors
wanted was a video game.


2514
02:27:34.296 --> 02:27:37.656
But I wanted something that could
be expanded into a real computer.
