1
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.000
<i>In the territory of New Mexico,</i>
<i>toward the end of the Civil War...</i>


2
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.100
<i>an Indian, Sierra Charriba,</i>
<i>and his 47 Apache warriors...</i>


3
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.100
<i>raided, sacked, and looted an area</i>
<i>almost three times the size of Texas.</i>


4
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.500
<i>On October 31, 1864...</i>

5
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.400
<i>an entire company</i>
<i>of the 5th United States Cavalry...</i>


6
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.000
<i>sent out from Fort Benlin to destroy him...</i>

7
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.600
<i>was ambushed and massacred</i>
<i>at the Rostes ranch.</i>


8
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.400
<i>We are indebted to Timothy Ryan, bugler,</i>
<i>5th United States Cavalry...</i>


9
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.000
<i>the company</i>'<i>s sole survivor, for his diary...</i>

10
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.600
<i>the only existing record of this tragedy,</i>
<i>and the campaign that followed.</i>


11
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.500
Let go of me! I want my mom!

12
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.500
Pony soldier, I am Sierra Charriba.

13
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.100
Who you send against me now?

14
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.300
- Lieutenant!
- Sir?


15
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.500
Take the first, second and third squads
and cover the ridge sides.


16
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.800
- Yes, sir.
- lf I signal you to come, you come.


17
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.900
If I signal you to charge, you charge.

18
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.300
If I signal you to run,
you follow me and run.


19
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.300
- Otherwise hold your position.
- Yes, sir.


20
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.000
- First squad to the right.
- Mr. Potts.


21
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.800
Second squad to the left.

22
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.400
Major.

23
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.000
I'm a long way from Gettysburg.
Any suggestions?


24
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.600
Let's go have a look, slow and easy.

25
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.400
To the left. To the right.

26
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.000
<i>November 1.</i>

27
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.500
<i>This morning I returned with the relief</i>
<i>column to the scene of the massacre.</i>


28
00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.500
<i>The Major had expressed little hope...</i>

29
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.600
<i>that any of the civilians or troopers</i>
<i>would be alive.</i>


30
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.700
<i>But Samuel Potts, the Major</i>'<i>s scout...</i>

31
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.800
<i>knew Apaches well</i>
<i>and said they never kill boy children.</i>


32
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.100
<i>They take them as captives</i>
<i>and raise them as warriors.</i>


33
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.300
<i>He felt the three Rostes boys</i>
<i>may still be alive.</i>


34
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.200
<i>But he had no such hope</i>
<i>for their sister, Beth.</i>


35
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.600
<i>He was right.</i>

36
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.300
<i>I looked down at her</i>
<i>and thought with hatred of Riago...</i>


37
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.300
<i>our Apache scout, who
led us to this place.</i>

38
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.400
<i>His body was never found...</i>

39
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.700
<i>and I will always wonder if he escaped</i>
<i>the massacre or was part of it.</i>


40
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.000
Hold your positions!

41
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.400
- That scarf belonged to Lt. Brannin.
- That's for you, Major.


42
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.800
I hope he was dead
when they did that to him.


43
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.800
If he was dead they wouldn't have bothered.

44
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.800
- Go cut him down, Sergeant.
- Brannin was a soldier, Amos.


45
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.400
Goes with the pretty girls and the pension.

46
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.000
How much chance have I
of getting those children back?


47
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.300
One chance in a thousand, I'd say...

48
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.000
if they gave you a division
and a year to do it, at least.


49
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.200
Much chance of that, is there?

50
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.300
I'll take five days
to get men, horses, ordnance.


51
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.500
On the fifth day I want you back
at Fort Benlin to tell me where Charriba is.


52
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.400
I'll get the children and I'll get him.

53
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.500
- Sam.
- Yeah?


54
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.100
Don't get yourself killed.
That would inconvenience me.


55
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.200
Ryan!

56
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.900
<i>With so many troopers away...</i>

57
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.800
<i>five Confederate prisoners</i>
<i>broke out of Fort Benlin and escaped.</i>


58
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.100
<i>We trapped them on our way back.</i>

59
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.700
Evening, Ben.

60
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.300
Evening, Amos.

61
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.300
Should have tried it before I took command.

62
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.300
Command of what, the burial detail?

63
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.700
- Move them out, Lieutenant.
- Move them out!


64
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.700
Troops, right! 
Pair of twos, right!

65
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.700
I brought back your wandering boys,
Captain.


66
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.900
Now you tell me how they got loose.

67
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
They clubbed two guards
and went over the wall.


68
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.400
I'd like to point out, Amos,
at the time of the escape...


69
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.200
131 men of this command
were half a day's march from here...


70
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.700
either digging graves or rotting in the sun,
waiting to be buried.


71
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.900
I want every prisoner that can walk
on this parade ground in 10 minutes.


72
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.700
Including those in irons.

73
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.500
Bugler, sound assembly.

74
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.000
They're gonna give us a party, Captain.

75
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.500
It sure looks like it.

76
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.200
You thieves, renegades, deserters...

77
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.500
you gentlemen of the South.
I want some volunteers.


78
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.200
I want volunteers to fight
the Apache Sierra Charriba.


79
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.600
I need horse soldiers.
Men who can ride, men who can shoot.


80
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.200
In return I promise you nothing.

81
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.000
Saddle sores, short rations,
maybe a bullet in your belly.


82
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.300
And free air to breathe,
a fair share of tobacco, quarter pay.


83
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.100
My good will.

84
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.700
Best offices for pardons
and paroles when we get back.


85
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.000
I don't know
what that might be worth to you.


86
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.500
But I do know if any man signs on with me
and then attempts to desert...


87
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.500
I will shoot him out of hand.

88
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.600
From you I'll accept one man
with some experience of command...


89
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.600
as an acting lieutenant.

90
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.700
Captain Tyreen...

91
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.500
does the prospect of serving
under your country's flag once again...


92
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.400
seem more attractive
than dragging its chains in this prison?


93
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.400
It is not my country, Major Dundee.

94
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.500
I damn its flag and I damn you...

95
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.900
and I would rather hang than serve.

96
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.200
Corporal Veitch just died, sir.

97
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.500
And hang you will!

98
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.500
You and your four good friends.

99
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
You're going to stand trial
on a charge of murder.


100
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.800
That guard you clubbed just died.

101
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.500
You've been found guilty of the charges
and specifications here mentioned.


102
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.600
It is the sentence of this court
that on November 6...


103
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.100
at 6:00 a.m. you shall be hanged by the neck
until dead.


104
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.400
Remove the prisoners,
with the exception of Benjamin Tyreen.


105
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.500
Right face, forward march.

106
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.600
These proceedings are closed.

107
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.000
Sit down.

108
00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.500
Five years.

109
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.100
You're still blaming me
instead of yourself, huh?


110
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.500
I'll say one thing, Ben,
you sure haven't mellowed any.


111
00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.500
When are you going to learn
you made all your own troubles?


112
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.600
Who had me cashiered out of the regiment?

113
00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.900
I cast one vote out of five.

114
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.700
Two of those votes were for my acquittal.

115
00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.200
But not you. Not my own captain.

116
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.200
Not my own friend.

117
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.200
The conscience of the court
was not my concern.


118
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.500
What did concern you, Amos?

119
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.700
- That the man I killed was a Yankee?
- He was your brother officer.


120
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.700
It was a duel of honour.

121
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.200
You're Southern born,
you knew what that meant.


122
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.000
If he had killed me,
and he had a chance...

123
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.400
- would you have convicted him?
- I would.


124
00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.100
You're a liar.

125
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.300
You voted to please the generals
in Washington.


126
00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:00.100
You voted a promotion
for Amos Charles Dundee.


127
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.900
You're a traitor to your country, Ben.
You gonna blame me for that, too?


128
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.700
Sergeant!

129
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.000
Yes, sir.

130
00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.000
I should have known better
than to try to talk to you.


131
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.000
You'll try again, Major.

132
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.300
<i>The Major had asked for thieves,</i>
<i>renegades and deserters...</i>


133
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.900
<i>and that</i>'<i>s what he got.</i>
<i>After four hours he had accepted only three.</i>


134
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.400
Ryan, what are you doing here?

135
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.300
I'm volunteering, too, sir. 
I've earned it, sir.

136
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.000
You'll need a bugler, sir.

137
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.300
- Stand over there.
- Yes, sir.


138
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.300
Benjamin Priam, sir.

139
00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.400
What do you do?

140
00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.700
What did you say?

141
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.300
- Speak up, I can't hear you.
- I'm a horse thief!


142
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.600
You a good horse thief?

143
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.200
The best there is, sir.

144
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.600
Sign your name or make your mark.

145
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.000
I need horses and mules, Mr. Priam.

146
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.600
Here's the amount you'll have to spend...

147
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.800
and here is your safe-conduct.

148
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.100
- Do you need an escort?
- No, sir.


149
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.100
He'll be back, sir.

150
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.400
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

151
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.100
- Corporal.
- Yes, sir.


152
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.900
- Get Lt. Andreen.
- On duty, Major.


153
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.100
- Lt. Fredericks.
- Hospital.


154
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.500
- Lewison.
- Officer of the day.


155
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.000
- Sgt. Cable?
- Patrol.


156
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.600
- Get me Lt. Graham.
- Yes, sir.


157
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.600
- Five hours, five men.
- You need a regiment.


158
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.600
Charriba can't be taken by a pick-up
company of garrison troopers.


159
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.900
You should know that by now.

160
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.100
What are you trying to say, Frank?

161
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.400
Come on, speak up. Spit it out!

162
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.200
I'm not trying to say that
the massacre was your fault.


163
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.700
I'm saying that you should recognise
that your transfer to this post...


164
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.700
was a disciplinary action, pure and simple.

165
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:34.100
And if you try to fight your own war again
as you did at Gettysburg, they'll break you.


166
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:40.000
They won't break me,
not if I get Charriba and those kids.


167
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.500
Has it occurred to you, Major...

168
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.100
that the Apache will undoubtedly
enter Mexico for the winter?


169
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.100
Mexico presently contains an army
of 30,000 French soldiers.


170
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.200
Yes, it's occurred to me.

171
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.200
Frank, I am a professional soldier,
I'm not a prison keeper.


172
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.900
Now this is something that's gotta be done
and I'm gonna do it...


173
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.300
now!

174
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:09.200
Are you pursuing the Apache, Major,
or a promotion?


175
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.000
Whatever my reasons are, Frank...

176
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:19.000
you'd better get down on your knees
and pray to God I don't take you with me.


177
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.500
I suppose you intend to strip this garrison.

178
00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.600
I will take just 10 men from the command.
Volunteers.


179
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.700
The bulk of my force
will be made up of prisoners.


180
00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.600
You'd be well advised
not to accept Confederate prisoners...


181
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.000
even if they're forthcoming.

182
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.600
In my absence,
you'll assume command of the garrison.


183
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.500
Discharge all duties
incumbent upon that command.


184
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.400
I have, as you can see...

185
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.500
appended to your orders
a statement over my signature...


186
00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.000
to the effect that I assume
total and complete responsibility...


187
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.000
for all such actions.

188
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.200
Here. Does that cover it?

189
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.100
No, sir.

190
00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.400
I consider it my responsibility
to notify General Carlton...


191
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.600
of what I believe to be an irresponsible
and dangerous course of action.


192
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.800
- Do your worst.
- You could be shot for this, Amos.


193
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.300
My executioners will have to stand in line.

194
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.800
That's all, Captain.

195
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.700
Corporal Tinney!

196
00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:37.800
Sir?

197
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.500
Where in hell is Lt. Graham?

198
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.500
Carry on.

199
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:25.000
- The Major's waiting to see you, sir.
- Thank you, Corporal.


200
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.300
- Sir!
- Lieutenant Graham.


201
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.500
- They're not much, are they?
- No, sir, they don't seem to be.


202
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Cigar?

203
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.200
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

204
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.800
- Coffee?
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.


205
00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.900
Why did they put you in the cavalry,
Lieutenant?


206
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.600
- Sir?
- Why did they assign you to the cavalry?


207
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.600
You're ordnance, aren't you?

208
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.700
No, sir. Artillery.

209
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.400
- Artillery?
- Yes, sir.


210
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.400
As Napoleon said, "Only thunderbolts
can be preferred to cannon."


211
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.300
- Napoleon?
- Yes, sir!


212
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.800
You'll do, Lieutenant. 
You'll have to.

213
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.900
I need rifles and ammunition.

214
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:13.000
It's all listed there in that inventory:
number of rounds, types of ordnance.


215
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.900
You go get them for me.

216
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.200
Forthwith.

217
00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.300
Yes, sir!

218
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.200
Lieutenant.

219
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.400
- Sir?
- Where are you going?


220
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.600
I said, "Where are you going?"

221
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.800
To obtain...

222
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.400
these weapons?

223
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.000
And just how and where
do you intend to accomplish that?


224
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.300
It has come to my attention that
a supply train from the Ordnance Depot...


225
00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.200
at Denver,
en route to the 2nd California Column...


226
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.400
now garrisoned in Santa Fe...

227
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.400
should be encamped tomorrow morning
at the Sand River crossing...


228
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.300
thirty miles away.

229
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.800
Now, if you have the opportunity,
you might just take C Troop.


230
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.900
See if you can be of any assistance.

231
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.900
Yes, sir.

232
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.200
<i>November 4.</i>

233
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.300
<i>Lt. Graham had no official orders,</i>
<i>but this didn</i>'<i>t stop him.</i>


234
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.400
<i>He was very persuasive,</i>
<i>with Sgt. Gomez and C Troop standing by.</i>


235
00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.200
<i>He took what the Major needed.</i>

236
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:44.100
<i>We returned with 48 new Henry rifles,</i>
<i>5,000 rounds of ammunition...</i>


237
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.400
<i>and a baby howitzer</i>
<i>for the lieutenant to play with.</i>


238
00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.600
I see you transferred back to the artillery,
Lieutenant.


239
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.000
Yes, sir.

240
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.800
<i>Over a hundred civilian prisoners</i>
<i>volunteered...</i>


241
00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.900
<i>and from them the Major took six,</i>
<i>and they were doubtful at best.</i>


242
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.400
<i>While we waited for horses,</i>
<i>the rebel prisoners that we needed...</i>


243
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.700
<i>watched the gallows being built.</i>

244
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.900
<i>The gallows on which the Major will hang</i>
<i>Sgt. Chillum, the Hadley brothers...</i>


245
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.100
<i>Jimmy Lee, and their captain.</i>

246
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.700
Captain.

247
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.800
- You figure he's bluffing?
- Sure, he's bluffing.


248
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.700
He needs us much
more than we need him.

249
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.500
Captain, that ain't no dance floor
they're building for us.


250
00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.000
We just want you to know, sir,
that whatever you figure on...


251
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.000
we're all with you.

252
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.600
<i>Without Confederate volunteers,</i>
<i>the Major was forced to accept cowboys...</i>


253
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.600
<i>drifters and drunks.</i>

254
00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.200
You wanted Injun-fighting, mule-packing,
whiskey-drinking volunteers, sir.


255
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.400
Well, by God, you've got one.

256
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.700
What am I going to do with you?

257
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.200
He's the biggest drunk,
but the best packer in the territory, sir.


258
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.300
- What's your name?
- Wiley.


259
00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.000
Wiley, make your mark.

260
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.600
- Whiskey?
- All you can drink.


261
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.400
When you've earned it.

262
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.000
Sergeant, throw him in a cell
and dry him out.


263
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.800
- Come on, Wiley.
- I never seen anything like it.


264
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.900
- How many is that, Ryan?
- Twelve, sir.


265
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.500
- Name?
- Dalhstrom.


266
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.500
Any man with a just cause
should travel with the word of God.


267
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.300
With all due respect,
God has nothing to do with it.


268
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.800
I intend to smite the wicked,
not save the heathen.


269
00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.700
Seventeen years ago,
I married John and Mary Rostes.


270
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.900
Who that destroyeth my flock,
I will so destroy.


271
00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.600
Reverend.

272
00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.500
<i>November 5.</i>

273
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.000
<i>The Confederate prisoners are angry</i>
<i>and uneasy, waiting for tomorrow...</i>


274
00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.700
<i>the day the rebel captain</i>
<i>and his four companions are to hang.</i>


275
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.400
<i>We are fearful of the consequences.</i>

276
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.700
<i>All of us know the Major needs the Captain</i>
<i>and his men...</i>


277
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.700
<i>but the Major is stubborn.</i>

278
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.300
<i>I think he will hang them</i>
<i>if they don</i>'<i>t volunteer.</i>


279
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.100
I would like to volunteer, sir.
Me and my six coloureds.


280
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.500
I haven't asked for volunteers
from the command.


281
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.000
- We're doing the asking, sir.
- Why?


282
00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.300
To fight, sir.

283
00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:01.600
We've been standing guard
and cleaning stables for nearly two years.


284
00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.900
Tomorrow morning you ask
the officer of the day to see me.


285
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.700
You and your six coloureds.

286
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:11.900
Thank you, sir.

287
00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.600
The rebel captain
Ben Tyreen's compliments, sir.


288
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.300
He will see you now.

289
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:25.900
He will?

290
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.500
Yes, sir.

291
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.300
And he further states that he will
volunteer himself and his men as needed...


292
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.300
for double rations for all prisoners
plus Gen. Carlton's written guarantee...


293
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.000
that all Southern soldiers
who serve with you, sir...


294
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.700
will be automatically granted full pardon.

295
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.500
Now, sir,
if I may be so bold as to suggest<i>...</i>


296
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.500
Guard!

297
00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.900
- Open it up.
- Yes, sir.


298
00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.500
Major, it has come to my attention...

299
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.100
You kill one of my soldiers and then
have the gall to dictate terms to me?


300
00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.700
You're a damn traitor, Ben.

301
00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.300
You were a rebel
before you ever saw the South.


302
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.000
And now you're a murderer.

303
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.800
Tomorrow morning, I am going to hang you
and be done with you.


304
00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.100
Jailer.

305
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.200
Sergeant!

306
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.700
How many men do you need?

307
00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.500
Twenty. Good ones.

308
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.200
Until the Apache is taken or destroyed,
only that.


309
00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.500
Agreed.

310
00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.500
Then you have my word, Major.
We will serve.


311
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.300
But after that we're going home.

312
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.500
If it's too rich for you...

313
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.500
hang us now and be done with it.

314
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.300
I just might hang you
and that Injun to the same tree, Ben.


315
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.700
You'll play hell getting it done, Amos.

316
00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.400
This man will hold lieutenant's rank
under myself and Lt. Graham.


317
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.700
Will you serve?

318
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.200
Until the Apache is taken or destroyed, sir.

319
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.100
Attention!

320
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.500
Lieutenant Graham,
get away from that damn bell!


321
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.800
Priam, they're a bunch of Roman-nosed,
broken-gutted, spavined...


322
00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.400
sore-footed, swaybacked dogs.
You call yourself a horse thief?


323
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.400
Samuel Potts!

324
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.200
Those Injuns you got with you
look kind of shy, Samuel.


325
00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:43.200
- They ain't sure they're welcome, Amos.
- Get on up here. I'll buy you a drink.


326
00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:46.900
Ryan!

327
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.000
<i>Today Mr. Potts got back.</i>
<i>With him was Riago.</i>


328
00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.900
<i>If Lt. Brannin were alive</i>
<i>he would hang the Apache...</i>


329
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.800
<i>and I would help.</i>

330
00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:58.800
Yeah, but where in Mexico?

331
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.200
The children?

332
00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:08.000
Well, they're skinny,
but doing better than you'd expect.


333
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.200
Making their own arrows now.

334
00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.300
That's Riago who rode
in with you, isn't it?

335
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.800
They all look alike to you, Amos?

336
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.900
I asked you a question, Sam.

337
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.500
That's Riago.

338
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.100
Where'd you find him?

339
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.500
Didn't. He found me.

340
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.100
He said after the massacre
he hit for the bush, stayed on their trail...


341
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.400
figured I'd be along sooner or later.

342
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.500
I believe him, Amos.

343
00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.100
Who's the other one?

344
00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.700
He's got a personal score to settle.

345
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:05.100
Seems old Charriba wouldn't take him
along with him on this last raid.


346
00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.200
Said he couldn't be trusted.

347
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.100
Now he's got his mind set
on killing the old man.


348
00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:15.000
Do you expect me to believe these Apaches
will turn against their own families?


349
00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.100
Track down their own people?

350
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.500
Why not?
Everyone else seems to be doing it.


351
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.200
Lt. Brannin didn't trust Riago. Right, Ryan?

352
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.000
Yes, sir.

353
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.600
I'm afraid I go along with that, Sam.

354
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.900
Well, you go along with Lt. Brannin then.

355
00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.500
Well, you go along without me.

356
00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.000
Sam Potts.

357
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.900
Looks like the Union jackets
you gave us didn't quite fit, Major.


358
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.600
So I see.

359
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:34.200
<i>The last day was spent getting</i>
<i>acquainted with our comrades-in-arms.</i>


360
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:55.400
<i>Learning how to handle the pack animals</i>
<i>with sureness and dispatch.</i>


361
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.200
<i>And learning the character of our officers.</i>

362
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.800
Troop, fall in!

363
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.500
Foot soldiers,
I want a company of twos on my right.


364
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.000
Cavalry, fall in 20
paces in front of me.

365
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.800
I want a column of twos on my right!
Line up here.


366
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.600
Get that mule out of there!

367
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.300
Fall them in with the artillery,

368
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.600
Column of twos on my right!

369
00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.100
Fall in!

370
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.500
If I tell you one more time,
you're court-martialed!


371
00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.500
Why don't you find a horse and mount up,
Lieutenant Graham?


372
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.000
You don't seem
to be doing very well on foot.


373
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.400
Mount up!

374
00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:56.300
<i>November 7, and we were ready,</i>
<i>all who volunteered.</i>


375
00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.500
<i>Civilians, criminals, Southerners,</i>
<i>and Negroes.</i>


376
00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.900
Gentlemen,
we've given the Major our parole...


377
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.200
and we will serve him
until I say we will not.

378
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.500
And until that time...

379
00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.600
he will be your commanding officer
and will be treated as such.


380
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:14.300
And any sign of disrespect to him
will be taken as a personal insult by me.


381
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.800
Don't worry none, Uncle Ben,
when the time comes...


382
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.400
we'll turpentine that caulky,
chicken-picking Yankee.


383
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:23.100
I am not your uncle,
you redneck peckerwood.


384
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:28.100
And one more word out of you
and you'll end this campaign in chains.


385
00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.000
Attention!

386
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.000
Good luck, Frank.
Give my regards to the General.


387
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:44.200
I mean for you to have that pleasure
within the week, Amos.


388
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.000
If you don't, good luck.

389
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.500
I have but three orders of march:

390
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:58.200
If I signal you to come, you come.
If I signal you to charge, you charge.


391
00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:02.100
And if I signal you to run,
you follow me and run like hell.


392
00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.400
Move them out, Lieutenant.

393
00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.800
- Twos right!
- Twos right!


394
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.100
- Left turn!
- Left turn!


395
00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.800
- Whistle me a tune, son.
- Yes, sir.


396
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.700
<i>November 18.</i>
<i>We are now in Texas approaching Mexico.</i>


397
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.000
<i>And the Major</i>
<i>does not mean to be surprised...</i>


398
00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.500
<i>by Confederate patrols out of Fort Davis.</i>

399
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.400
- No fires tonight, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.


400
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.200
Trooper Hadley,
you are not part of my gun crew.


401
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.100
Cold coffee again.

402
00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.100
It's 50 miles to the border,
and 86 to Fort Davis.


403
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:44.200
I wonder if we'll make it.

404
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.700
Make what, Sergeant Chillum?

405
00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.600
Make it back to where we come from,
Captain.


406
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.400
We'll make it. 
It's just a question of time.

407
00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.100
<i>It was just after dawn and we were starting</i>
<i>for the Rio Grande when Riago returned.</i>


408
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.400
<i>I still don</i>'<i>t trust him.</i>

409
00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.500
- Twos right!
- Major.


410
00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.700
Says he got close enough
to smell the stink of many white men.


411
00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.100
I wager they're waiting for us
at the river, Amos.


412
00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:24.100
- We'd better walk on water.
- Let's find out what we're made of.


413
00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.200
Boy!

414
00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:32.500
Full gallop, son. We'll let those rebels
know there's a Yankee army come to call.


415
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.900
Troop, halt!

416
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:19.100
Mr. Potts. Sergeant Gomez.
First 12 men across as skirmishers.


417
00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.000
- Troop right, roll!
- Lieutenant Graham, move them out!


418
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.700
Column of twos.

419
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.300
Confederate cavalry, Lieutenant.

420
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.900
We don't have much time.

421
00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:18.400
Your word's worth about
as much as your cause.


422
00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:22.800
- Then why don't you release him from it?
- Ben, you gave it, you break it.


423
00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.500
And be damned to you.

424
00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:28.300
- What do you want from us anyway?
- I've got what I want, Sergeant.


425
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.100
I've got his word.

426
00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.400
- Sergeant Chillum.
- Sir.


427
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.800
- Move them out.
- Which way, Captain?


428
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.300
To Mexico, you bloody idiot!

429
00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.800
<i>November 19. 
We are in Mexico...</i>

430
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.500
<i>November 19. 
We are in Mexico...</i>

431
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.100
<i>and this day</i>'<i>s events</i>
<i>have made it clear to everyone...</i>


432
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.800
<i>that the Major</i>'<i>s present war is not</i>
<i>with the South, but with the Apache.</i>


433
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.600
- Lunge!
- That's very good, Aesop.


434
00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:10.900
Thank you, sir.

435
00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:14.800
But as Napoleon said, only thunderbolts
can be preferred to cannon.


436
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.100
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.


437
00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.600
Order arms.

438
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.500
Thank you, Priam.

439
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Boy, I'm speaking to you!

440
00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.200
You're forgetting your manners, nigger.

441
00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:53.800
Come on over here
and pull off my boots.

442
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.400
Lieutenant Graham.

443
00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:08.900
Check the pickets.

444
00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.400
Did you hear me, boy?

445
00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.800
Do it, boy, now.

446
00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.100
Let me, son.

447
00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:48.900
Let go off my leg!

448
00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.900
Preacher, you sure kick up a lot of dust
with your sermon.


449
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.000
Don't forget your footgear, sonny.

450
00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:42.000
- You started it, now finish it.
- No, we're gonna finish it.


451
00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:45.200
By doggies, Preacher,
now we're gonna get in line for you.


452
00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:49.500
- I'm gonna cut me a piece of you first.
- You southern trash sit down!


453
00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.800
Was you talking to me, Sergeant?

454
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.600
Now maybe you don't know it,
but you're fixing to get tried.


455
00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:03.600
You and all the rest of your bluebellies.

456
00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.900
Trooper!

457
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Mr. Aesop, we would like to compliment you
and your men...


458
00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:47.700
on the way you handled the river crossing
this afternoon.


459
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:50.900
Thank you, sir.

460
00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:25.300
That gesture was necessary.
I'm sorry it was so painful for you.


461
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.400
Mr. Aesop is a fine soldier.
It won't happen again.


462
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.800
What happened is what it's all about, Ben.

463
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.200
If it was as simple as that, Amos.

464
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.100
We can take care of our own.

465
00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.900
If you can, you waited
too long to do it.

466
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.900
All you people, all
the way down the line.

467
00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:50.400
"You people"?

468
00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:54.500
I'm not going to thank you for keeping
your word this afternoon at the river.


469
00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.400
You were obliged to.

470
00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.000
But it wasn't easy, and
I respect you for it.

471
00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:04.800
I don't need respect from a man who took
his kin to fight against their own brothers.


472
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.800
I took soldiers to fight for their country.

473
00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.400
- You betrayed it.
- What country have I to betray?


474
00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:18.200
I'm fighting for the only country I have left,
and I kill men in a hopeless war for it.


475
00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:22.400
But not men who were my neighbours
and my friends.


476
00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.600
Friends.

477
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.200
The best friend you ever had
was the man who got you into West Point.


478
00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.500
He was killed with the 2nd Michigan
in Chickamauga last winter.


479
00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.300
- Did you know that?
- I knew that, Amos.


480
00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:40.400
You're a would-be cavalier,
an Irish potato farmer with a plumed hat...


481
00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:44.400
fighting for a white-columned
plantation house...


482
00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.800
you never had and never will.

483
00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:54.600
How exactly do you see yourself,
Major Dundee?


484
00:46:55.700 --> 00:47:00.400
Have you ever stopped to think why
they made you a jailer instead of a soldier?


485
00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:38.100
<i>December 22, 1864.</i>
<i>We are five weeks into Mexico...</i>


486
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:41.000
<i>and have lost all contact with the Apache.</i>

487
00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.500
<i>Even the scout, Samuel Potts, admits this,</i>
<i>and I</i>'<i>m glad.</i>


488
00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:49.100
<i>I wish to avenge the massacre,</i>
<i>but I remember it too well, and I</i>'<i>m afraid.</i>


489
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:54.400
<i>How can we catch the wind</i>
<i>or destroy an enemy we never see?</i>


490
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:04.700
<i>It is Christmas Eve,</i>
<i>the year of our Lord, 1864...</i>


491
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.500
<i>and there is a deep and reverent sense of</i>
<i>peace and tranquillity in the camp tonight.</i>


492
00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.500
<i>Mr. Potts and Riago, the Apache...</i>

493
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:17.300
<i>indulge in a high-spirited,</i>
<i>brotherly bout of wrestling.</i>


494
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.400
<i>At stake is Mr. 
Potts</i>' <i>gold railroad watch...</i>

495
00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:24.000
<i>and the Apache</i>'<i>s shotgun</i>
<i>with the silver inlaid stock.</i>


496
00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.100
<i>It is a friendly contest.</i>

497
00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.000
Come on, Injun, get up.

498
00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.600
There he is over there, go get him!

499
00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.500
- That one brought him.
- Get up!


500
00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:55.300
I think he's going to take you, Samuel.
You know why?


501
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.600
Because the artillery's betting on you.

502
00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.600
Do you know Lt. 
Graham's bet $5 on you?

503
00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.800
Artillery and a lieutenant, to boot.

504
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.500
Did you ever hear of an artilleryman
winning a bet, or a girl...


505
00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:13.400
or a war when there was cavalry about?

506
00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:17.000
- Who bet against me?
- Me.


507
00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:02.400
- Just one, Major. He wants to talk.
- Bring him in.


508
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.700
He says he's a good Apache,
and he's peaceful...


509
00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:20.100
and for nobody to shoot at him.

510
00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:24.300
- Is he a Chiricahua?
- He surely is.


511
00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.300
Why would an old man like that
be raiding with Charriba?


512
00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:36.100
He says, why not? 
It's their land, all of it.

513
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Now he'd like a little soft food
as his teeth are no longer with us.


514
00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:46.600
Why did he quit?

515
00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.900
Charriba kicked him out.

516
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:58.200
He says he's too old,
much too old to fight anymore.


517
00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:00.900
Ask him why I should believe him.

518
00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.300
Well?

519
00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:14.400
He says Charriba's camp is across the river.

520
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:18.100
He'll lead us there. 
They'll be asleep.

521
00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.500
Does he expect me to believe that?

522
00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:35.900
Let him lead us into an ambush?

523
00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:48.000
He says his heart is true, Major...

524
00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:51.000
and he brings proof.

525
00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.200
What kind of proof, Mr. Potts?

526
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.500
The children.

527
00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.700
He's brought the children.

528
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.300
Pretty good.

529
00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:21.300
Go on, sing up.

530
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.000
Soup's on.

531
00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.600
Here's one for you, shorty.

532
00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:32.100
Come on, buck, get around here
where you can eat.


533
00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.300
- Can I have seconds?
- Get in here.


534
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.500
- Don't we get any?
- Watch out, don't spill it.


535
00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:41.900
Don't look to me like them gut-eaters
has been feeding them very good.


536
00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:44.900
- Did you ever see a fat Apache?
- I ain't yet.


537
00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:51.100
This is good.

538
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.800
You're going back now that you've got
what you came for, Major?


539
00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:04.000
Everything points to that old man
talking straight.


540
00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.100
Potts is half convinced.

541
00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.300
I'm more than half.

542
00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.900
Did it ever occur to you
that Charriba gave us what we wanted...


543
00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:15.800
because he intends to take it back again?

544
00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:18.000
It's occurred to me.

545
00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:24.900
I want two of your best men
to help Sgt. Gomez take the children home.


546
00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.500
We'll still outnumber you, Amos.

547
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.400
You surely will, Ben.
Now go do as you're told.


548
00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:38.600
Yes, sir.

549
00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:45.700
But only until the Apache is taken
or destroyed.


550
00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:53.700
<i>Sgt. Gomez headed back to safety</i>
<i>with the three Rostes boys...</i>


551
00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:57.600
<i>Sgt. Gomez headed back to safety</i>
<i>with the three Rostes boys...</i>


552
00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.700
<i>while we followed the old Apache</i>
<i>toward Sierra Charriba.</i>


553
00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:15.200
Lieutenant,
take 12 men across as skirmishers.


554
00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:17.500
First 12 men, follow me.

555
00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:00.500
- Sergeant Chillum, take them through.
- Yes, sir.


556
00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.900
Get them back to the
far side of the river!

557
00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:24.800
Back to the river!

558
00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:55.600
- Try and regroup on the far bank!
- Hadley, run them out!


559
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.200
Keep moving, Lieutenant Graham,
there's nobody left to shoot at out here.


560
00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:12.600
Merry Christmas.

561
00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:32.500
He was making a doll for his girl child.
Riago!


562
00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:37.600
How did they know?

563
00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.900
They're Apache.

564
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
Just what in hell is he?

565
00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:51.900
I'm a tame Apache.

566
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.300
A camp dog.

567
00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:56.900
Christian Indian.

568
00:58:57.900 --> 00:58:59.500
Charriba is Apache.

569
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:05.700
Sam, you take this camp dog
and go find me Charriba.


570
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:13.500
That's what you pay us for, Amos.

571
00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:29.700
- Wiley, did you get hit?
- No, sir.


572
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.400
One of them damn mules kicked me.

573
00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:42.400
Fourteen men killed, sir. 
Thirteen wounded.

574
00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.100
Four critically.

575
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:50.000
70% of all stores lost, 20% ammunition...

576
00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:53.300
and 60% of livestock either killed or stolen.

577
00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:56.200
- Damn it to bloody Confederate hell!
- What?


578
00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000
- Sorry.
- He's all right, Doctor.


579
00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.200
He'll live forever
and have a hundred children.


580
01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.900
But if time and battle prove
that you have a weakness...


581
01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:08.100
for being shot in that vicinity,
I'd wear an iron board inside my pants.


582
01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:19.600
You tell him go easy with that, Major,
or I'll shoot you right between the eyes.


583
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.900
You patrolled this whole area with Grant
in '47, didn't you?


584
01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:28.000
Yes. The tequila was excellent.

585
01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:32.400
How far would you say we are
from the nearest food and shelter?


586
01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:36.900
About a week's march. Maybe less.

587
01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.900
There's a pretty village, and rather friendly.

588
01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:44.000
If you're really serious
about replenishing our supplies...


589
01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:48.500
there's a well-stocked garrison
I could recommend just about here.


590
01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:52.900
But we'd probably have to tangle
with some French Lancers.


591
01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.700
That's one thing I plan to avoid.

592
01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:59.400
Major, we can't follow the Apache.

593
01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.100
I'm not letting go of that Injun.

594
01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:05.200
- Boy!
- Sir!


595
01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.500
Pass the word to the command
we move out in the morning.


596
01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.700
And bring me a bottle
of that medicinal brandy.


597
01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:20.100
There is no more brandy, sir,
except at the bottom of the river.


598
01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:25.900
Now this time, 
Lieutenant, try and hold still.

599
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Prepare to move out in the morning.

600
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:51.000
We left a lot at
the bottom of the river.

601
01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:09.300
We ask thee, Lord, to take these soldiers
who have fallen in thy service.


602
01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:10.700
Amen.

603
01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:45.500
We got whipped, Major.

604
01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:50.500
Burying your dead is
not going to change it.

605
01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.600
<i>January 9, 1865.</i>

606
01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.900
<i>Sgt. Gomez and the troopers returned today.</i>

607
01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:11.400
<i>The Rostes boys are well and safe.</i>

608
01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:14.000
<i>This made us feel
better, but not for long.</i>

609
01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.200
He's not running anymore.

610
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.500
He's waiting.

611
01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.400
Let's move. Mount up!

612
01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.500
<i>January 10.</i>

613
01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.500
<i>Two more died last night.</i>

614
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.300
<i>I</i>'<i>m afraid all the wounded will perish</i>
<i>unless we rest.</i>


615
01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:18.500
<i>I wonder whether any
of us will ever return.</i>

616
01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:22.400
<i>The war of rebellion and Fort Benlin</i>
<i>seem very far away.</i>


617
01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:36.500
The village is occupied.

618
01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:41.000
The blockhouse, there are 10, 15 men.

619
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.900
Regulars, I think. I don't know.

620
01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.600
Their garrison is about six hours away...

621
01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.900
and about 300 Lancers,
Legionnaires, or maybe less.


622
01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:54.400
We'll move on the village at sunup.

623
01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:07.400
Dismount! Prepare to fight on foot!

624
01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:11.000
- Horses to the rear.
- Get those horses!


625
01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:24.700
- Point blank range.
- Fuse timing zero.


626
01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:28.000
Unload.

627
01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:30.300
Locked, loaded and primed,
and ready for firing.


628
01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.200
- Stand by.
- Standing by, sir.


629
01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.200
Boy, whistle me a tune.

630
01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.000
Will you show the colours, sir?

631
01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:40.000
No, Lieutenant,
we will not show the colours.


632
01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:43.700
All right, Sam, make it short
and to the point.


633
01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.600
Hey, get out here!

634
01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:11.900
Compliments, Major Amos Dundee,
irregular United States Cavalry.


635
01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.900
You have five minutes to surrender
your arms and stores...


636
01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:18.200
- or he's going to cut loose.
- He would not dare.


637
01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.600
This is an act of aggression
against a friendly power...


638
01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:24.700
- an outrageous breach of international law.
- Sonny...


639
01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:27.800
the Major ain't no lawyer.

640
01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:30.800
You've now got four minutes.

641
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.600
Sergeant, I want to talk to the mayor.

642
01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:57.600
- There seems to be no end to it.
- What did you say?


643
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.200
We've been attacked by Apaches,
by local bandits...


644
01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:05.300
by freebooters from Texas,
then liberated by the French...


645
01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:08.000
and now United States Cavalry.

646
01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:12.000
Unfortunately, you came too late.
We have nothing to give you.


647
01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:15.700
No food, no guns, no women.

648
01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:22.000
That is what you want, isn't it?

649
01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:26.100
That's why you come here
without flying your country's brave flag.


650
01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:31.200
Are you speaking for these people?
You're not Mexican, are you?


651
01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.600
My husband was the doctor of this village.

652
01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.800
But he was also
the doctor for the Juaristas.

653
01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:40.200
He died there, where they did.

654
01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:43.000
I've paid for my place here.

655
01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:45.900
Well, I'm sorry for that, ma'am,
but we've come a long way.


656
01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:49.100
I need fresh horses and food.
My men are hungry.


657
01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.100
They are no more hungry than this village.

658
01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:04.600
They are willing to share everything
they have got with you, Major...


659
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
most particularly their hunger.

660
01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:10.000
Would you like to see the children
in our dispensary...


661
01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.100
whose sickness is starvation?

662
01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:14.100
- Lieutenant Graham, fire!
- Sir!


663
01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.500
Sgt. Gomez, slaughter two mules,
distribute the meat...


664
01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:34.500
and whatever stores you find in that
blockhouse to the people of the village...


665
01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:38.100
- and to this lady.
- Teresa. Teresa Maria Santiago.


666
01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:40.600
- Ma'am. Ryan!
- Yes, sir.


667
01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:47.300
Lieutenant!

668
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.100
With beauty such as yours,
this village is rich beyond comparison.


669
01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.300
Lieutenant Tyreen!

670
01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.700
God save the Queen.

671
01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:30.300
<i>We entered the village</i>
<i>to take food and horses...</i>


672
01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:33.100
<i>We entered the village</i>
<i>to take food and horses...</i>


673
01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:36.300
<i>but instead gave away our own,</i>
<i>and everyone was thankful.</i>


674
01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:03.100
<i>Our wounds were tended</i>
<i>by a German lady...</i>


675
01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:06.300
<i>who spoke English and was pretty,</i>
<i>if somewhat old.</i>


676
01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.900
- Hold it there, will you?
- Thank you, ma'am.


677
01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:13.800
<i>Also, a very lovely Mexican girl</i>
<i>who was kindness itself, gentle and young.</i>


678
01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.000
Don't worry, son, it ain't near your heart.

679
01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.800
To the victors belong the spoils.

680
01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:44.300
Well, Ben, you look quite the gentleman.

681
01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.900
After the war, Amos...

682
01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:51.000
the Tyreens of County Clair become
the landed gentry of Virginia.


683
01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.000
It's not over yet.

684
01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:00.300
By midnight tonight I want every man in this
command drunker than a fiddler's bitch.


685
01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:04.900
At that point, our prisoners will escape
and run for help.


686
01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:08.300
But we will not discover this until sunup.

687
01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.100
Tomorrow night, after following us all day...

688
01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:15.700
that French cavalry will camp and prepare
to attack our disorganised rabble.


689
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.400
But before they make their move,
we will steal them blind and be on our way.


690
01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:23.900
You are either...

691
01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:28.600
a $70, red-wool, pure-quill military genius...

692
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.200
or the biggest damn fool
in Northern Mexico.


693
01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:35.300
No question of it.

694
01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:44.400
You haven't got the temperament
to be a liberator, Amos.


695
01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.900
I don't?

696
01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:19.200
If I may suggest, sirs,
the time has come to join the fiesta.


697
01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:24.500
Sitting alone is bad for the soul.

698
01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.900
Captain Tyreen. 
Does he shave?

699
01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:58.500
- Does it matter?
- Didn't to me.


700
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.500
She's not here.

701
01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.000
Too bad.

702
01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:29.900
There was something about that woman.

703
01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:37.400
There sure, sure was.

704
01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.500
Made me think of...

705
01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:43.600
satin.

706
01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:47.900
- Soft, white satin.
- Major.


707
01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.200
Excuse me, Major.

708
01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.900
A waltz.

709
01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.200
I'd be delighted, sir.

710
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.900
- Lieutenant Graham.
- Sir!


711
01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:09.200
- Why aren't you with the pickets?
- I've been relieved, sir.


712
01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:12.100
Carry on.

713
01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:18.900
Sir, in my opinion we need more guards
at the blockhouse...


714
01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.800
or the French prisoners are going to escape.

715
01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:26.300
Thank you, Lieutenant, for your opinion.

716
01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:29.200
Now, I trust you will carry on.

717
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.400
No, sir. You see, 
I'm cutting in, sir.

718
01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.100
- What?
- Cutting in, sir.


719
01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:42.400
Lieutenant Graham,
have you been drinking?


720
01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.800
- Senorita.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.


721
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.100
A Mexican dance, perhaps?

722
01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:54.900
I wanted to say goodbye, and thank you.

723
01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:01.300
It was good to celebrate just being alive.

724
01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:05.900
- Are you planning to stay on here now?
- I don't know.


725
01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:12.200
I met my husband when
he was a medical student in Vienna.


726
01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:15.400
My family disapproved violently.

727
01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:19.400
So violently, I no
longer have any ties there.

728
01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:22.700
And I'm needed here.

729
01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:28.100
There is no one else except for Linda,
not for a hundred miles.


730
01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:35.200
You will say goodbye to Lt. 
Tyreen for me?

731
01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.200
I'd be delighted.

732
01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:44.200
I liked the way
he asked me to dance.

733
01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.100
As if we were
in a ballroom in Vienna.

734
01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:52.400
- It was a lovely little charade.
- The Lieutenant has style.


735
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.700
He must be a fanciful man.

736
01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:02.300
He is corrupt. 
But I will save him.

737
01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:28.200
Thank you for being kind.

738
01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.300
All I feel is kindness.

739
01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.800
Next time I'll be more fanciful.

740
01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:50.600
Hadley! Wiley! 
Get them mules in here.

741
01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:03.800
Mount up. Just fall in. Get in there.

742
01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:08.200
Ryan is missing, sir.
Graham went to look for him.


743
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.200
- Who went to look for Graham?
- Gomez.


744
01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:25.600
Sergeant Gomez,
be gentle with the bugler boy.


745
01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:27.400
He's ill.

746
01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:31.900
Take your time, Trooper Ryan,
take your time.


747
01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:36.000
We're delighted you decided to join us.

748
01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:40.000
Now if you'd only warned us,
we could have sent Sgt. Gomez...


749
01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:42.400
to serve you breakfast in bed.

750
01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.700
Ryan, put it in the saddle!

751
01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:16.000
All accounted and<i>...</i>

752
01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:19.400
All present and accounted for, sir.

753
01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:22.600
I can see that, Lieutenant Graham.
I can clearly see that.


754
01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.000
Suppose you could manage
to move them out now?


755
01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:29.800
Twos left, right turn.

756
01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:38.900
<i>Last night the Major let</i>
<i>the French prisoners escape.</i>


757
01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:42.100
<i>He hoped they would go to</i>
<i>their garrison for reinforcements.</i>


758
01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:43.500
<i>They did.</i>

759
01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:47.400
<i>This afternoon he sent Lt. Graham</i>
<i>and some troopers out as a decoy.</i>


760
01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:49.500
<i>The rest of us hung back, waiting.</i>

761
01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:52.600
Jefferson, that scarf is
to decorate the cannon, not you.


762
01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:54.900
- Yes, sir.
- Wiley, secure those pack animals.


763
01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:57.500
Sergeant Chillum, are the pickets out?

764
01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:00.600
They're out. Not that they'll do any good.

765
01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.000
If them Lancers has got a fieldpiece...

766
01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:08.400
they could move it in,
lay in one round, and then finish us off...


767
01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:11.300
with them 10-foot frog stickers
they're packing.


768
01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:14.800
No, they'll camp.

769
01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:18.400
Begging your pardon, Lieutenant,
but who says so?


770
01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:21.500
I do.

771
01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:07.200
Don't they look pretty?

772
01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:15.100
My boys can take that outfit,
the walking ones anyway...


773
01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:18.600
with one hand tied behind our backs.

774
01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.500
How's that, Aesop?

775
01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.400
They're soft, O.W.
They ain't never been south.


776
01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:34.900
They're closing up.

777
01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:38.700
They'll be less than five miles
from Graham by full dark.


778
01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:41.300
What if they don't stop?

779
01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:45.500
What if they don't camp? They just keep on,
smash hell out of the Lieutenant?


780
01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:53.500
Mighty is the arm of the Lord.

781
01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:31.200
<i>January 15. It took the French</i>
<i>three days to discover...</i>


782
01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:34.800
<i>all they were chasing was</i>
<i>a one-armed scout and a renegade Apache.</i>


783
01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:38.100
<i>By that time, Mr. Potts and Riago</i>
<i>figured we were safe...</i>


784
01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:40.800
<i>and decided to lose them and find us.</i>

785
01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.200
<i>We rested and healed our wounds.</i>

786
01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:06.300
Hey! I'm drowning!

787
01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:09.600
- Come on in.
- I already had my bath.


788
01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:12.000
Hey, the water's fine.

789
01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:17.900
- First shave, Tim?
- Yep.


790
01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:21.700
- Maybe we should call you Ryan now.
- Yeah.


791
01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:39.200
<i>We are waiting for Mr. Potts, Sgt. Gomez...</i>

792
01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:42.200
<i>and the rebel captain to return</i>
<i>from the scout.</i>


793
01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:45.900
<i>We fear that the French have taken</i>
<i>reprisals against the village.</i>


794
01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:48.500
<i>I keep thinking about Linda</i>
<i>and pray for her safety.</i>


795
01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:51.400
- What happened?
- Just like watching a bird die.


796
01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:53.900
- And the woman?
- I don't know, Amos.


797
01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:56.400
If they hanged her, they cut her down.

798
01:29:56.500 --> 01:30:00.000
Them boys in the pretty hats
make the Apache look like missionaries.


799
01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:03.300
Never underestimate the value
of a European education.


800
01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:06.500
- No sign of Charriba?
- Don't worry about that, Amos.


801
01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:08.700
He wants to drag it out.

802
01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:12.000
I think he figures on leaving stories
about you that'll be told...


803
01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:15.400
around the campfires of his people
for a thousand years.


804
01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:29.800
<i>We were healing,</i>
<i>becoming a command again.</i>


805
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.300
<i>Hard and watchful, anxious for battle...</i>

806
01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:35.200
<i>when that which</i>
<i>the Major hated most occurred.</i>


807
01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.300
Sir! A deserter.

808
01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:45.300
O.W. Hadley has deserted, sir. Last night.

809
01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:49.700
A horse is gone,
food and ammunition supplies broken into.


810
01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:58.100
Mr. Potts, you take Riago
and pick up his trail.


811
01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:01.100
I want that man back.

812
01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.600
It ain't my job, Major.

813
01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:10.100
I didn't sign on to go chasing
after no homesick soldier boys.


814
01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:12.500
It's mine.

815
01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:26.100
All right, Sergeant, you find him.

816
01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:34.300
Beg your pardon, sir...

817
01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:37.500
but what'll they do to Pvt. Hadley
when they catch him?


818
01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:38.700
What?

819
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.800
Son, it'd be our good
luck if he killed him.

820
01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:45.500
But he won't and the Major will.

821
01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:47.600
Oh, no, Mr. Potts...

822
01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:50.700
the Major will not.

823
01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:31.600
<i>In two days,</i>
<i>Sgt. Gomez returned with O. W. Hadley.</i>


824
01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:36.300
<i>Along the way he found the lady doctor</i>
<i>with some children and Linda.</i>


825
01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:39.300
<i>They had all fled the village.</i>

826
01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:43.100
<i>The Major wasted no time</i>
<i>trying O. W. Hadley for desertion.</i>


827
01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:47.900
Boys, by doggies, I want you to know
what kind of company we've been keeping.


828
01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.500
He just plain clean
shot a hole in me.

829
01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:55.600
And he would have
let me bleed to death...

830
01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:59.700
if it hadn't been for that woman over there
come along and bandaged up my leg.


831
01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:04.500
Now, you know I ain't no deserter.

832
01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:09.600
I just went into that village to court
a little senorita and say hello to her folks.


833
01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.700
I was fixing to come back. I was.

834
01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:17.600
You all know I always stay close
to my big brother.


835
01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:20.200
- Ain't that right, Arthur?
- That's right.


836
01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:24.100
And you ain't gonna let them shoot your kin
for no deserter, are you, Arthur?


837
01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:26.900
You gonna do something about it,
ain't you?


838
01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:31.400
Sergeant, I don't want
to look up at him.

839
01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:48.400
Captain.

840
01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:57.400
You know me.

841
01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:01.200
I've been over the hill before.

842
01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:05.800
But I always come back, didn't I?

843
01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:11.000
And you whipped me for it
and I deserved it.


844
01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:15.900
But you never killed me none.

845
01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:20.600
Now you ain't gonna hand me over
to no bluebelly...


846
01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:23.300
just because I had a hankering
for a woman?


847
01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:32.100
She's a sweet little thing, Captain.

848
01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:36.100
She's pretty and polite and a lady.
She surely is.


849
01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:39.300
And that grub is for her kinfolks.

850
01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:44.200
You remember her, Captain?

851
01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:48.300
I was dancing with her and I introduced you
to her. You remember her, don't you?


852
01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:49.600
I remember.

853
01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:53.300
Sergeant Chillum, would you say it was
common knowledge in this camp that...


854
01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:56.500
that village had been burned,
people scattered?


855
01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:08.900
Well, I know that, Major, sir...

856
01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:12.000
but I just figured I'd sit there
and wait till they come back.


857
01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.000
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.


858
01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:17.200
How much food and ammunition
would you say was taken?


859
01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:20.800
Enough for three men for a week, sir.

860
01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:25.600
Look, Major, forget about the book.

861
01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:29.400
The men of this command risked their lives
for those supplies.


862
01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:33.200
It may have slipped your mind,
but he also risked his life.


863
01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:36.600
Trooper...

864
01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:40.000
you're gonna be shot.

865
01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:42.300
Hadley!

866
01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:50.500
Major, hand him over to us.
I'll deal with him.


867
01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:55.900
I'm not going to let you kill him.

868
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.700
You used to be a soldier.
Do you know what you're saying?


869
01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:02.800
I'm saying if you kill that boy
that's the beginning of it and not the end.


870
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.500
You're wearing out, Ben.

871
01:36:04.700 --> 01:36:08.200
You were a rock once,
now you're crumbling like old chalk.


872
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Lieutenant, select a firing squad by lot.

873
01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:17.300
- Exclude the Confederates.
- Yes, sir.


874
01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:24.100
I said we will serve in this command
and we will serve!


875
01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:28.400
But only until we have caught the Apache.

876
01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:34.700
And then, Major...

877
01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.400
I am going to kill you.

878
01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:42.800
Are you, Ben?

879
01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:47.400
Yes.

880
01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:51.800
Yes, Amos.

881
01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:07.800
You gonna let them shoot me, Captain?

882
01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:13.200
I'm obliged to, son.

883
01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:18.000
You should have remembered
you belong to the Major and not to me.


884
01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:26.800
I'm sorry.

885
01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:45.500
That's it, boys, by doggies...

886
01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:49.700
let's pitch in and get it over with.

887
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.600
Hell, Major, you're just doing
what you got to do...


888
01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:04.500
but damn your soul for it,
and God bless Robert E. Lee.


889
01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:02.700
<i>We are a command divided against itself,</i>
<i>and I fear nothing will ever heal this breach.</i>


890
01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:07.700
<i>Even some of our own people</i>
<i>are bitter against the Major.</i>


891
01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:12.100
<i>But he bears the burden of command</i>
<i>and I do not feel fit to judge him.</i>


892
01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:52.700
I'm not one of your soldiers.

893
01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.700
I could not bear to be with all those men,
in the midst of all that hatred.


894
01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:08.100
- May I walk with you?
- Not afraid of the tiger?


895
01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:12.900
Are you the tiger
that prowls these mountains?


896
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.100
No, I'm not afraid, Major.

897
01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:32.900
- Oh, it's lovely here.
- I don't spoil it?


898
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.300
No.

899
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.800
What happened today was terrible.

900
01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:57.700
We all died a little with that boy.

901
01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:01.700
But perhaps you, most of all.

902
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.800
Why are you with me?

903
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.300
I've seen too much dying...

904
01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:25.300
and I wanted so desperately to feel alive...

905
01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:29.800
for both of us to feel alive.

906
01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:22.000
It troubles you a great deal, doesn't it,
how the men feel about you?


907
01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:25.900
I'm concerned with how they fight,
not how they feel about me.


908
01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:29.100
But why is this so important, this fighting?

909
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.900
There are other things.

910
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Men can understand fighting.
I guess maybe they need it sometimes.


911
01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:40.700
The truth is, it's easy.

912
01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Forget about your problems,
responsibilities...


913
01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:48.200
just let someone feed you,
tell you what to do.


914
01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:50.600
But whom do you answer to?

915
01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:05.800
If you go to Durango you'll have to go
into hiding, won't you?


916
01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:10.400
It will be difficult, but not impossible.

917
01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:17.100
Did you ever think
about living in the United States?


918
01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.900
I don't think about that, Major.

919
01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:48.400
Get it out.

920
01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:52.100
I can't. It's too deep.
It's too close to the artery.


921
01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:55.400
They have to take you
to the doctor in Durango.


922
01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:57.900
I'm staying with the command.

923
01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:01.200
You get me some whiskey and bandages.
Go on.


924
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.500
Sergeant, get a stretcher for the Major.

925
01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:15.500
You're getting leave, Major.

926
01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:24.200
And it's time you did.

927
01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:28.000
In fact,
you ought to give up soldiering altogether.


928
01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:31.700
You were trapped at the river.
Ambushed like a shavetail.


929
01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:35.800
You caused a boy's death
and you've split your own command.


930
01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:40.600
And now how do you explain
being outside your own picket lines?


931
01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:44.200
What are you doing, Major, easing
your conscience in the arms of a woman?


932
01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:47.800
A woman, if I might say so,
of rather doubtful virtue.


933
01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:58.400
Just what the bloody hell are you
doing here in the first place, Amos?


934
01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:07.600
There are so many French soldiers
in Durango.


935
01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:12.100
We won't show the colours.

936
01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:24.800
- I can't speak the language.
- But you understand.


937
01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:30.400
Major.

938
01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:11.900
It is close, very close.

939
01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:16.800
If you're thinking
of cutting that leg off, Doctor, don't.


940
01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:28.000
I am only concerned
to stop the loss of blood.


941
01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:33.800
Though much of it is alcohol.

942
01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:41.200
You should be able to walk
in seven days and ride in twelve.


943
01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:43.600
I'll walk in two
and ride in one more.

944
01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:47.400
Mr. Potts, you and Sgt. Gomez
can rejoin the command now.


945
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.700
I can get to
the river camp by myself.

946
01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:57.900
And I'm perfectly capable
of following your trail from there.


947
01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:02.000
Well, you'd better stay
off those streets, Amos.


948
01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:04.000
You make an unlikely-looking Mexican.

949
01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:26.900
No, it's no use.

950
01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:30.100
They're on to me, those Frenchman.

951
01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:34.700
Just waiting for me to run,
lead them back to the command.


952
01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:07.100
I see our French friends are still waiting.

953
01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:18.100
The tequila. Did you bring the tequila?

954
01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:27.900
I asked for something to drink.
This isn't enough to spit.


955
01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:49.400
No.

956
01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:02.700
Sure, it gets better every day.

957
01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:06.500
Be able to dance on it soon.

958
01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:10.000
You don't believe me?

959
01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:14.200
I'll show you. Come on.

960
01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:23.000
Miss Covington, I believe I have
the honour of this next quadrille.


961
01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:42.000
You wait and see.

962
01:50:58.100 --> 01:51:00.500
This army doesn't dance...

963
01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:04.000
doesn't march, doesn't fight.

964
01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:13.400
Except on this last battlefield.

965
01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.600
We're joining the Juaristas at Guaymas.

966
01:51:57.500 --> 01:52:01.200
I came here to reassure myself
that you were still alive.


967
01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:05.000
I'm alive.

968
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.300
Yes, I see.

969
01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:34.700
You should be careful.

970
01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:37.500
The French police is already suspicious
of this place.


971
01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:38.800
Wait.

972
01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:45.800
If I ever do get out of here<i>...</i>

973
01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:51.500
The war won't last forever.

974
01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:57.200
It will for you, Major.

975
01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.100
No, the war will not last forever.

976
01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:54.500
"Awake! For Morning in the Bowl of Night

977
01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:58.600
"Has cast the Stone
that puts the Stars to Flight"


978
01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:07.700
- What are you doing here?
- I've come to rescue you.


979
01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:11.100
We spent all night looking for you.

980
01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:14.400
- Why?
- So I can kill you myself.


981
01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:18.500
Makes sense.

982
01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:34.000
Well, there goes our little watchdog.

983
01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:38.400
Shall we go, Major?

984
01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:42.200
I drink, Ben. Did you know that?

985
01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:47.600
That is the secret of my great success.
I drink.


986
01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:54.500
But I don't drink enough.

987
01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:58.300
Why don't you drink, 
Lieutenant Tyreen?

988
01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:01.600
Don't you ever have any doubts
about who you are?


989
01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:04.100
I've been three men already, Amos.

990
01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:07.700
That's enough for one lifetime.

991
01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.200
- Irish immigrant...
- Cashiered American officer.


992
01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:14.100
And Confederate renegade.

993
01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:19.500
- I don't like any of them.
- Well, now, isn't that a coincidence.


994
01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:23.200
Get away from me.

995
01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:26.200
I have orders, appropriate to your character.

996
01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:29.300
I have to take
you out the back door.

997
01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:45.800
- Finish it.
- The patrol. We leave now.


998
01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:47.300
Leave me alone, all of you.

999
01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:49.300
Company!

1000
01:55:50.100 --> 01:55:51.500
Sergeant Gomez.

1001
01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:56.100
Major.

1002
01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:06.600
Fire!

1003
01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:11.000
Lt. Graham will be
a general before he's 30.

1004
01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:29.600
Why, come on, get out of it!

1005
01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:33.300
- Come on!
- Ben, for God's sakes, let me be.


1006
01:56:34.900 --> 01:56:36.400
Why not, Major?

1007
01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:40.000
You're not worth killing anyway.

1008
01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:18.600
Until the Apache is taken or destroyed.

1009
01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:31.400
<i>January 30. We thought we had lost</i>
<i>three troopers in Durango...</i>


1010
01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:34.800
<i>but two returned this morning,</i>
<i>and we became a command again.</i>


1011
01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:38.100
- Lieutenant Graham!
- Yes, sir.


1012
01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:43.100
When I left I gave you a specific order.
You failed to carry it out.


1013
01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:45.700
No, sir. You gave me a command.

1014
01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:48.500
From then on I gave the orders.

1015
01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:53.100
You surely did. Have a cigar.

1016
01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:57.400
Move them out, Lieutenant.

1017
01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:02.900
<i>We ran from the French</i>
<i>as we followed the Apache...</i>


1018
01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:05.000
<i>but time was running out.</i>

1019
01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:09.200
<i>The French patrols became thicker</i>
<i>while we never got closer to Sierra Charriba.</i>


1020
01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:25.600
- How long ago?
- Four or five hours ago.


1021
01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:30.000
Charriba says you're to make
your peace with your Christian God...


1022
01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:33.000
as you are about to join him.

1023
01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:37.000
We must have hurt the old man
at the river more than we figured.


1024
01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:39.700
At least now he's got to finish it.

1025
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:44.500
So far, he's been circling west.

1026
01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:51.200
Some time in the next week or two
he'll hit us again in a canyon...


1027
01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:55.300
or the middle of a
river at night, or dawn.

1028
01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:59.800
When are we going to stop fighting
this Indian on his own terms?


1029
01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:02.400
Right now.

1030
01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:06.300
From this point on we tuck our tail between
our legs and run for home...


1031
01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:09.800
- straight for the Rio Grande.
- You'd let Charriba escape?


1032
01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.900
Let's just say I'm giving him
an equal opportunity, Lieutenant.


1033
01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:15.200
Major, but we have
to make it look good.

1034
01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:18.700
First swing right, then head for the river.
But we really got to move.


1035
01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:21.800
If we don't, he'll be waiting for us there,
just like he is now.


1036
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:25.000
- How'll we know?
- We won't, until it happens.


1037
01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:28.100
On your horse, 
Lieutenant, move them out.

1038
01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:34.700
- Go cut him down, Sam.
- You cut him down, Major.


1039
01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:39.600
I think he's earned it.

1040
01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:54.900
<i>March 23. Today we learned</i>
<i>that Riago had been a true soldier.</i>


1041
01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:59.300
<i>I bitterly regret my suspicions,</i>
<i>as I</i>'<i>m sure does the Major.</i>


1042
02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:40.800
<i>April 18. We ran from the Apaches</i>
<i>and the French...</i>


1043
02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:43.900
<i>then circled and headed</i>
<i>for the river and home.</i>


1044
02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:47.300
<i>The men were angry,</i>
<i>wanting to continue our pursuit.</i>


1045
02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:51.200
<i>And then suddenly we all knew</i>
<i>we weren</i>'<i>t running away from anything.</i>


1046
02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:53.900
<i>We were running toward</i>
<i>the end of our search.</i>


1047
02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.500
River's less than a mile from here.

1048
02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:00.900
This is your last chance, Major.

1049
02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:04.000
It's as good a place as any
to do what you got in mind.


1050
02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:06.700
Sergeant, if you put your pickets out
far enough...


1051
02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:08.600
the Apache might leave them alone.

1052
02:01:08.700 --> 02:01:12.300
But no matter what happens,
don't fire unless you're attacked.


1053
02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:15.400
Just remember your orders and hope.

1054
02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:23.900
Good luck, Mr. Potts.

1055
02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:29.100
Who will you send against me now?

1056
02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:40.000
Fire.

1057
02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:36.300
He looks so small now.

1058
02:04:37.900 --> 02:04:39.800
He was big enough, son.

1059
02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:56.000
Now, Major...

1060
02:04:58.100 --> 02:05:00.300
or across the river in Texas?

1061
02:05:01.700 --> 02:05:03.800
Right now is just fine, Ben.

1062
02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:09.600
You boys want a fight, 
I got one for you.

1063
02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:13.600
Get up here and look.

1064
02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:26.000
<i>We had forgotten the French,</i>
<i>but the French had not forgotten us.</i>


1065
02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:33.600
Where can we ford the river into Texas?

1066
02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:37.800
It's the only shallow spot within
a half day's march from here, Major.


1067
02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:43.100
Mount up the troop, Lieutenant,
we're going back home.


1068
02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:44.900
- Sergeant Gomez!
- Sir?


1069
02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.800
- Mount the troops, we're moving out now!
- Yes, sir.


1070
02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:17.500
Congratulations, Major.

1071
02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:20.700
It appears that at last
you have found yourself a real war.


1072
02:06:21.100 --> 02:06:22.300
- Sergeant Gomez.
- Sir?


1073
02:06:22.300 --> 02:06:24.000
Dismount and deploy your men...

1074
02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:27.300
prepare to receive a mounted cavalry charge
from your front.


1075
02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:30.100
They won't charge, Major. 
Why should they?

1076
02:06:30.300 --> 02:06:33.600
By holding their positions,
they hold us here for the others.


1077
02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.600
- We have to move against them.
- When I'm ready.


1078
02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:38.200
- Lieutenant Graham.
- Sir?


1079
02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:40.200
- Make ready your artillery.
- Yes, sir.


1080
02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:41.900
- It's ready, sir.
- Simon.


1081
02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:43.500
Break out the ammunition...

1082
02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:45.800
we're about ready
to engage the pride of Europe.


1083
02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.200
Yes, sir.

1084
02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:50.200
- Well, Ben?
- I'll need five men mounted.


1085
02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:52.700
I'll hit their flank
after you break their charge.


1086
02:06:52.900 --> 02:06:54.800
- Bully.
- Bully.


1087
02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:02.600
Lieutenant, show the colours.

1088
02:07:03.300 --> 02:07:05.100
- Standard-bearer!
- Sir?


1089
02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:07.400
Show the colours.

1090
02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:11.600
- Sergeant Chillum.
- Sir!


1091
02:07:12.700 --> 02:07:16.100
Cut the fuse for 500 yards. 
Elevation 20<i>...</i>

1092
02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:19.600
- Make that 28 degrees.
- Ready, sir!


1093
02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:22.300
Start the ball, Lieutenant.

1094
02:07:32.500 --> 02:07:34.200
A mile, maybe less.

1095
02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:47.400
They'll be coming now.

1096
02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:52.300
- Sergeant Gomez.
- Sir?


1097
02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:55.900
- The bugle will be your signal to fire.
- Yes, sir.


1098
02:07:56.100 --> 02:07:58.500
Company, charge!

1099
02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.400
Any of you damn gringos fire
before the signal...


1100
02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:12.200
I swear to God I kill you.

1101
02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:20.000
On my signal, the horses.
I repeat, only the horses.


1102
02:08:31.900 --> 02:08:33.300
Mount your men.

1103
02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:36.100
Take up a skirmish line
at the foot of the bluff.


1104
02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:44.000
Here comes the second wave, Ben.
We're ready when you are.


1105
02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.800
Rally around me!

1106
02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:19.200
Major, I shall see you in Texas.

1107
02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:22.100
You're damn right you will. Bugler!

1108
02:11:31.700 --> 02:11:33.600
Dundee!

1109
02:12:57.700 --> 02:13:00.000
All present and accounted for, sir.

1110
02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:03.200
Your orders, sir.

1111
02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:08.400
Move them out, 
Lieutenant, column of twos.

1112
02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:09.900
Column of twos.

1113
02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:22.300
- Trooper Ryan!
- Sir.


1114
02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:28.000
- Play us a tune, son.
- Yes, sir.


1115
02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:30.700
Forward, ho!

1116
02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.400
<i>April 19, 1865.</i>

1117
02:13:33.900 --> 02:13:36.900
<i>After a brief but costly battle</i>
<i>with French irregulars...</i>


1118
02:13:37.300 --> 02:13:40.900
<i>we crossed the Rio Grande</i>
<i>and re-entered the United States.</i>
