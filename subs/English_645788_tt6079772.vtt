1991 DA NANG, VIETNAM

00:02:13.807 --> 00:02:15.799
<i>Hello, did you do all of this?</i>

4
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.750
Beretta 93

5
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.470
Usually dependable.

6
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.550
We should be good to go now.

7
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.230
<i>Come on.</i>

8
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:51.550
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

THIRTY YEARS LATER
BUCHAREST, ROMANIA


10
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.550
<i>What the fuck? 
Are you having a party?</i>

11
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.430
<i>Where is Anton?</i>

12
00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:10.131
<i>Why didn't he answer the phone?</i>

13
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.830
<i>Vali!</i>

14
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.575
<i>Your father is looking for you.</i>

15
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:15.510
<i>Get up!</i>

16
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.310
<i>Get up, Vali!</i>

17
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.389
<i>Come on, girls, come on. Go home.</i>

18
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.110
<i>Away, away!
Come on, get out of here.</i>


19
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.910
<i>Come on Vali, let's go.</i>

20
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.950
<i>Anton?</i>

21
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.149
<i>Where the fuck is Vali?</i>

22
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.190
<i>You had to look over him,
where the fuck is Vali?</i>


23
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.550
<i>Yes?</i>

24
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.430
<i>Who's talking?</i>

25
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.510
<i>It's me, Vali.</i>

26
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.149
<i>Vali?</i>

27
00:04:45.328 --> 00:04:47.462
<i>Explain to me where did you go?
Why don't you--</i>


28
00:04:47.513 --> 00:04:49.988
<i>Some assholes kidnapped me
outside the hotel.</i>


29
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.329
<i>What? Who?</i>

30
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:52.750
<i>Who kidnapped you?</i>

31
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.030
<i>How they fuck would I know?</i>

32
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.030
<i>They want three million euros now.</i>

33
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.296
<i>Vali, tell them how I am.</i>

34
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.190
<i>They don't fucking care
who you are, just pay!</i>


35
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.619
<i>They want three million euros
in two hours.</i>


36
00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:06.234
<i>Or they'll cut my throat like a pig.</i>

37
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.190
How dare you take my boy?

38
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.110
There it is. You wanna count it?

39
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.070
Do you know who I am?

40
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:23.910
Don Preda.

41
00:07:25.292 --> 00:07:27.670
Butcher of Bucharest, 
Killer of Men.

42
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.510
Tell your boss it's done.

43
00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:36.750
Exactly, who are you people?

44
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.070
We're just--

45
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.670
We just find people
who can't be found.


46
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:45.149
The money.

47
00:07:46.034 --> 00:07:47.868
You gonna have it maybe for an hour.

48
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.390
Then we come take it back, cut you both
into pieces and feed you to my pigs.


49
00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:57.470
That doesn't worry you?

50
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.390
No.

51
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.110
Why?

52
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:03.990
I didn't come here for money.

53
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.550
I came here for you.

54
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.350
<i>Stop the girl. She killed
Don Preda. Kill her.</i>


55
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.670
Why are you fighting so hard, huh?

56
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.150
You're going home, motherfucker.
Fuck off!


57
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.030
I'm good.

58
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.750
<i>You fucking pieces of shit.
You can't leave me here!</i>


59
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.390
<i>Fuck you, you bastards!</i>

60
00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:46.472
Did you take any, huh?

61
00:09:46.522 --> 00:09:47.747
Take what?

62
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.990
Money.

63
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.529
It was all there, right?

64
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.110
We were paid to eliminate
the target. We did that.


65
00:09:53.167 --> 00:09:56.750
Yeah, you know, three mil…
dirty money… nobody's looking for…


66
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:57.950
Just saying.

67
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.270
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't know you're hurting.


68
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:01.870
Please.

69
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:08.110
This is R & D Plumbing.
Your leak has been fixed.


70
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.590
Please remit the balance
of your payment for the withd--


71
00:10:17.115 --> 00:10:18.703
<i>€7,000,000. 
Transfer complete.</i>

72
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:19.430
Done.

73
00:10:19.851 --> 00:10:21.950
You need to see
a doctor about that cough.

74
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.630
Traditional or a witch?

75
00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.830
You? Definitely a witch.

76
00:10:26.246 --> 00:10:28.190
Ah, I know just
the voodoo queen to call.

77
00:10:36.508 --> 00:10:38.483
LONDON

78
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.030
Chelmsford was a bloody war zone.

79
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.248
Every train was 30 minutes late
and jam-packed as always.


80
00:12:25.572 --> 00:12:26.591
Welcome back.

81
00:12:26.644 --> 00:12:28.123
Thank you for taking care of her,

82
00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:30.429
you know you're the only one
she'll tolerate, right?


83
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.387
She gets really mean when you're away.

84
00:12:32.487 --> 00:12:35.315
Spent most of the time
hanging out with Proust.


85
00:12:35.415 --> 00:12:36.188
Is that true?

86
00:12:36.213 --> 00:12:38.390
Three weeks, and this
is all you come back with?


87
00:12:38.463 --> 00:12:39.392
Ah, you know sellers,

88
00:12:39.492 --> 00:12:42.157
they know you've come all that way,
and they play hard to get.


89
00:12:42.188 --> 00:12:43.990
Didn't you wanna
just kill people like that?


90
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.910
What do you think you're doing, huh?

91
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:33.670
So, the other day, he says to me
"70 is the new 30."


92
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.663
Well, that's just something old guys say.

93
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:43.115
How is he doing with his protocol?
Is he following the doctor's orders?


94
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.300
More like, following his own orders.

95
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.590
Happy birth--

96
00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.270
No more fucking birthdays.

97
00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.990
Take birthdays and shove them up your ass.

98
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.710
Bastard.

99
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.110
What a wonderful toy!

100
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.390
You skimped on the candles I see.

101
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.870
Seventy would have been a fire hazard.

102
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:29.970
Could you make us some tea please?

103
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:31.070
Sure.

104
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.479
All right, make your wish.

105
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.430
Happy birthday.

106
00:14:43.143 --> 00:14:43.978
Yeah.

107
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.190
To thank you.

108
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:16.910
A 1958 Gibson Flying V.

109
00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.150
This was in production just two years.

110
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.910
There is only 90 in the whole world.

111
00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:24.030
I know.

112
00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:29.150
That sound…

113
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:30.950
It's the wood.

114
00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.470
African limba.

115
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:35.950
Nothing else sounds like it.

116
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.430
I was just about giving up hope
on finding one.


117
00:15:40.861 --> 00:15:43.541
How in the world did you…

118
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:44.230
You.

119
00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:47.462
You taught me how to find things
that didn't wanna be found.


120
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.510
Albert King played one.

121
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.270
Albert King played that one.

122
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:55.110
No!

123
00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:57.630
No!

124
00:16:00.278 --> 00:16:01.907
You're gonna cry now, aren't you?

125
00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:04.790
Only because I can't play it the way
it needs to be played.


126
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:08.830
Thank you.

127
00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.673
One of the twins called me
last night, said she was pregnant.


128
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:17.070
Daisy in Dover?

129
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.710
No, Daisy in Manchester.

130
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.350
Daisy in Dover is a dyke.

131
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:39.801
It is a rare gift to have a friend
who trusts you enough


132
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.630
not to try and help until you ask.

133
00:16:56.879 --> 00:16:58.929
If you fell in the pond
with those you'd drown.


134
00:16:59.029 --> 00:17:02.013
Well, if I fell in a pond without them
I would probably float away.


135
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:09.870
-Hi, honey.
-Mind your fingers.


136
00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:11.750
That hefa bites.

137
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.349
She's a baby and doesn't know any better.

138
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:19.589
There.

139
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.990
You have your own secret hideout.

140
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:31.150
Why am I not surprised?

141
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:35.630
I bought the building.

142
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:39.110
-What?
-The bookstore.


143
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:40.950
It's yours. Free and clear.

144
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:45.910
You didn't have to do that.

145
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.550
I know, but it's your passion.

146
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:51.145
And, it makes me feel good to know

147
00:17:51.245 --> 00:17:53.797
you'll have something
to work on while I'm gone.


148
00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:58.270
What is that?

149
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:04.550
Those are the souls
waiting for me on the other side.


150
00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.950
I'm sure they have a reception planned.

151
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.350
Ah… sent away so many prematurely.

152
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:12.950
Either by my hand or through you.

153
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:16.028
We never sent anyone away
who didn't have it coming.


154
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.910
Maybe.

155
00:18:17.942 --> 00:18:21.395
But… I'm sure there are
quite a few spirits up there


156
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:23.390
waiting for me with a bone to pick.

157
00:18:25.941 --> 00:18:27.701
You really believe you're going up?

158
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:28.590
Don't you?

159
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.070
Lucas Hayes.

160
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.830
I need our friend
to find him for me.

161
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:49.230
I have him up till 1998, Paris,
after that nothing.


162
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.550
-Just find?
-Just find.


163
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.950
Discreetly, and with the quickness.

164
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.150
Okay.

165
00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.310
I may have to go back to Vietnam.

166
00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:03.393
It'd be nice if you went with me.

167
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.536
I'm never going back there.

168
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:13.105
Our past is never
where we left it, little chameleon.


169
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.910
We all have scars.

170
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.190
You stare at them long enough
you remember how you got them.


171
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.750
-Hi.
-Morning.


172
00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:00.114
The blue dress has a small tear in it,
I was hoping to talk to Benny about it.


173
00:20:19.032 --> 00:20:20.056
What do you think?

174
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:21.390
Of what?

175
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:24.430
My, mustache.

176
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.750
Oh, you know, I don't have
my contacts in, sorry.


177
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:32.630
Funny.

178
00:20:33.062 --> 00:20:36.862
You wait till this grows in
women like you are gonna be so…


179
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.910
No, it's okay. 
I'll help you out.

180
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.390
I need you to find this guy.

181
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:45.350
What? No satellite shots of a
mafia compound outside Bucharest?


182
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.390
No, but that was
some of your better work.


183
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:51.630
Moody wants this guy, Lucas Hayes,
last seen in Paris in '98 and then nothing.


184
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.950
Yeah.

185
00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:01.012
I'll be with you in a second.

186
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.950
Can I help you?

187
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:07.840
Yeah, I'm looking for a book,
an old book. Like, rare.


188
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.550
-"Like rare"?
-Yeah.


189
00:21:09.605 --> 00:21:11.089
Either they are or they aren't.

190
00:21:11.113 --> 00:21:14.045
Books aren't like stake,
you can't get them like medium rare.


191
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.590
-It's funny.
-Sarcastic.


192
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:16.830
Yes, but funny.

193
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:22.310
Listen, my boss' wife is having a party
and she collects books, first editions.


194
00:21:22.389 --> 00:21:23.390
Any particular subject?

195
00:21:23.415 --> 00:21:25.615
Birds. It's Audobon's…

196
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:26.590
"Birds of America"?

197
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:29.070
Yeah, that's it.
He said she's looking for a copy.


198
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:30.470
-A first edition?
-Yeah.


199
00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:32.310
-Sorry.
-You don't have it?


200
00:21:32.413 --> 00:21:34.200
No one does,
only one first editions exists,


201
00:21:34.225 --> 00:21:37.750
it was sold to a private buyer
in 1991 for a 9.6 million dollars.


202
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:39.630
Wow, okay.

203
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:41.470
Well, looks like I'm out of luck.

204
00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:44.950
All right. What do you think?
Maybe poetry?


205
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:47.637
Hang on…

206
00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.910
It'll be the hit of the party.

207
00:21:56.038 --> 00:21:57.991
TAMERLANE AND OTHER POEMS

208
00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:00.950
I don't-
- I don't know this one.

209
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:02.590
It's Edgar Allan Poe actually.

210
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.430
His first collection of poems
published anonymously.


211
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:06.617
You think she might have it?

212
00:22:06.648 --> 00:22:10.070
Doubtful. Only 50 copies were printed.
Only 12 are known to exist.


213
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:12.190
How much?

214
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:14.670
I can give it to you for $265,000.

215
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:18.870
Perhaps a bracelet instead?

216
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.430
She does have exquisite wrists, good idea.

217
00:22:30.759 --> 00:22:31.961
Is there something else?

218
00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:33.350
I find you interesting.

219
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.350
-You mean--
-You're interesting.


220
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:38.610
Beautiful, sure, not in that
ornamental kind of way.


221
00:22:38.712 --> 00:22:40.910
It's the interesting part
that got me wondering,


222
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:42.190
Wondering what?

223
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:45.070
How long after I give you
my number will it take you


224
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:47.670
to decide that I'm just
as interesting and give me a call?


225
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:49.230
Twenty seven minutes.

226
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:50.350
That long?

227
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:54.310
First I have to pretend to cancel my date
and then I have to feed my cat.


228
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.430
That's six.

229
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.704
The rest is me playing hard to get.

230
00:23:06.557 --> 00:23:07.525
Cute.

231
00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:10.110
How many of these are you
carrying around, Mr…


232
00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:12.230
Rembrandt. Michael Rembrandt.

233
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:16.350
Actually, I haven't had an occasion
to use one until just now.


234
00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:18.470
So…

235
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:21.110
Interesting.

236
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:34.001
"There rose a fountain once, and there
full many a fair flower raised its head."


237
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.870
That was from the book, wasn't it.

238
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:48.031
"But she who rear'd them was long dead,
And in such follies had no part."


239
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:03.510
You almost got me on this one.

240
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.230
You didn't say I'd be tracking
an eight year old.


241
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:11.488
Lucas Hayes did arrive in Paris in '98,
but returned to Da Nang, March '99.


242
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:14.590
Everything else I have is on there.

243
00:24:45.516 --> 00:24:47.948
B. B. KING
LIVE AT THE VILLAGE GATE


244
00:27:06.526 --> 00:27:08.556
READY TO GO

245
00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:31.950
Benny?

246
00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.230
You'll stay up
until I get there, 45 minutes.


247
00:30:19.608 --> 00:30:22.190
Lucas Hayes, born April 5, 1990.

248
00:30:23.443 --> 00:30:25.544
Father: Edward Hayes.
Mother: Mary Christian.


249
00:30:33.372 --> 00:30:34.706
St. Quiteria Hospital

250
00:30:34.859 --> 00:30:37.366
Lucas Hayes, admitted
to St Quiteria Hospital on June 2nd, 1999.


251
00:30:40.093 --> 00:30:43.443
Father: Edward Hayes, assassinated
at Christmas Day, 1991. No other records.


252
00:31:09.273 --> 00:31:11.869
Edward Arthur Hayes

253
00:31:14.113 --> 00:31:17.235
Businessman indicted for war crimes
dies in car bomb attack.


254
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:22.320
Edward Hayes… was killed
in a car explosion in Da Nang yesterday.


255
00:31:27.759 --> 00:31:28.670
Moody.

256
00:31:32.605 --> 00:31:34.248
"Company will continue," vows CEO

257
00:31:34.305 --> 00:31:36.005
"Edward Hayes
was my partner for 25 years.


258
00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:39.551
I will continue to steer our company
as he would have wanted me to."


259
00:31:42.103 --> 00:31:45.010
Jossino Vohl

260
00:32:04.416 --> 00:32:06.519
DA NANG, VIETNAM

261
00:34:07.033 --> 00:34:08.658
Shit! What the fuck is that?

262
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.950
Fuck.

263
00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:49.350
<i>Honey! Come on.</i>

264
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:57.430
Never thought I'd see you here again.

265
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:59.797
Well, maybe you're not seeing me now.

266
00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:00.870
Who's the bitch?

267
00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:01.830
Billy Boy…

268
00:35:01.993 --> 00:35:04.790
I know you run with all kinds
but now you're running with stupid?


269
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:05.531
Fuck you!

270
00:35:05.566 --> 00:35:09.236
Hey! Go get a drink, sugar,
and give the adults some privacy, huh?


271
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:12.430
Beers!

272
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:18.950
Is that your ride outside?

273
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:21.990
Yours now.

274
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:23.630
It ain't my birthday.

275
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:25.590
Jossino Vohl.

276
00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:29.630
How's Moody?

277
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:32.270
He's dead.

278
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:40.030
For Moody.

279
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:45.310
Vohl involved?

280
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:49.150
I don't know. But he knows who is.

281
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.790
-He's gonna be hard to kill.
-I just wanna talk to him.


282
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:55.310
Steverino!

283
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:56.310
Yeah, Boss?

284
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:59.310
You work security at the State Tower.

285
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:02.030
My friend there needs
a few minutes with Vohl.


286
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.910
Alone.

287
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:05.840
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

288
00:36:07.224 --> 00:36:09.448
He goes nowhere without private security.

289
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:11.950
The guy's never alone.

290
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:22.230
<i>What is happening?</i>

291
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:40.950
This is how easy it is
for me to get to you, Mr. Vohl.


292
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:42.590
Do you understand?

293
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:46.550
You were friends and business
partners with Edward Hayes,


294
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:49.950
so you would know most
about his short but interesting life.


295
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.310
Good, cause I have questions.

296
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:55.163
You give me answers:
if I'm satisfied you'll never see me again,


297
00:37:55.263 --> 00:37:58.281
if I'm not, I'll be
the last thing you'll ever see.


298
00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:03.150
I look forward to hearing from you.

299
00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:26.950
<i>Good evening, Miss.</i>

300
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:31.030
<i>It's been a long time since such
a beautiful young woman gave me her number.</i>


301
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:32.830
You know who I am.

302
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:35.950
Jossino Vohl, born in April, 1945.

303
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:39.110
French national,
residing full time in Vietnam.


304
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:42.710
Was in business with Edward Hayes
until his untimely death.


305
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:47.430
Now you're a top political power broker
with some interesting side hobbies.


306
00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:50.470
I see you're familiar with my resume.

307
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:53.265
I am not interested
in your business activities, Mr. Vohl.


308
00:38:53.383 --> 00:38:55.470
I want to talk
about your friend's son, Lucas.


309
00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.630
My office, one hour.

310
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:59.710
We'll be alone?

311
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:01.950
<i>My lawyer will be present.</i>

312
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.670
That would be the man
standing behind you pouring a scotch?


313
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.190
<i>Delighted, Miss.</i>

314
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.230
Exactly on time.

315
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:01.750
Please.

316
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:05.630
Monsieur Duquet,
my personal attorney.


317
00:40:07.127 --> 00:40:09.696
-Would you like some champagne?
-Edward Arthur Hayes.


318
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:19.470
Eddie and I were involved
in a bauxite mining project together


319
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:20.550
until his accident.

320
00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:23.350
It wasn't an accident,
it was an assassination.


321
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:27.710
We were useful.

322
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:32.310
The country was malleable,
ripe for certain business practices.


323
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:35.230
Eddie was juggling
a lot of delicate plates.


324
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:39.830
What's your interest in a man
who's been dead almost thirty years?


325
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:42.070
I'm interested in his son.

326
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:44.070
Lucas Hayes.

327
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:45.190
I'm sorry?

328
00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:47.659
Three people are dead
because they inquired about him.


329
00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:50.190
He had them killed
and I'm going to find him.


330
00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:54.792
Should I be talking to him?

331
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:58.350
I have no connection with Lucas Hayes.

332
00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:01.310
And what does any of this
got to do with me?


333
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:02.910
I was wondering the same thing.

334
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:07.910
Mr. Vohl's past relationships
are no one's concern.


335
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:09.990
And certainly none of yours.

336
00:41:10.066 --> 00:41:11.367
Oh, I've made them my concern.

337
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:16.030
Too bad.

338
00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:38.950
I need to know everything.

339
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:41.070
Who are you?

340
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:44.590
Who hired you?

341
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:48.590
Why the interest in Lucas Hayes?

342
00:41:56.072 --> 00:41:57.874
We can do this
another way if you'd like.

343
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:12.390
Fucking let me go!

344
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:17.470
Get up there.

345
00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:21.190
Hand me a gun.

346
00:42:31.647 --> 00:42:32.772
SPRINKLER VALVE

347
00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:51.912
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

348
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:18.030
Say it.

349
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:19.470
Fuck you!

350
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:20.190
Say it!

351
00:43:53.285 --> 00:43:54.634
<i>She's down there!</i>

352
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:07.649
Let's start with your name.

353
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:14.230
Why was Moody looking
for Edward Hayes' son?


354
00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:19.270
Who else out there
should we know about?


355
00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:16.030
Fuck!

356
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:18.390
Anyone ever last this long.

357
00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:20.950
It's out of our hands now, anyway.

358
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.510
Him?

359
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:37.510
That was a long 27 minutes.

360
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:40.456
I'm still waiting for your call.

361
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:42.320
It's all right.

362
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:44.388
I don't take these things personally.

363
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:46.830
Bone broth.

364
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:50.710
Helps with inflammation and bruising.

365
00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:53.390
Here.

366
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:55.984
Careful. It's hot. Watch it.

367
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:58.030
There you go.

368
00:46:59.807 --> 00:47:00.710
I like this myself.

369
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:05.950
Here you go, small sips.

370
00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:08.790
Good?

371
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:13.344
Not gonna lie to you,

372
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:17.110
there's not much of a chance
this ends well for you.


373
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:20.470
That guy out there.

374
00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:22.430
We work for the same individual.

375
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:25.430
Boss has a problem.
He calls him, he takes care of it.


376
00:47:27.185 --> 00:47:30.270
Little heavy handed for my taste
but that's not my call.


377
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:34.190
I'm sorry about your friend, Moody.

378
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:38.270
I had no part in that.

379
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:41.270
Or the fire fight at the bookstore.

380
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:43.030
I'm an after-the-facts guy.

381
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:45.710
I come in to make sure
there's no loose ends.


382
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.710
I look for things that might
seem benign, but aren't.


383
00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:52.910
Like a bookstore run by an assassin,
boy, I never saw that one coming.


384
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:55.470
I misread you completely.

385
00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:02.408
I can help you out of here.

386
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:03.504
Okay?

387
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:05.578
But you have to help me.

388
00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:09.150
I'm your last line of defense.

389
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:12.070
End of the road, no more lifelines.

390
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:16.230
You understand?

391
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:20.510
All right.

392
00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:25.350
You forgot to blanch the bones.

393
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.830
Your soup.

394
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:33.830
You have to blanch the bones
before you roast them.


395
00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:37.390
Locks the minerals in,
it's better for healing.


396
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:54.377
You got anything out of her?

397
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:55.590
Yes and no.

398
00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:58.036
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?


399
00:48:58.099 --> 00:49:00.388
Means I'll be back in the morning
to follow up with her.


400
00:49:00.417 --> 00:49:02.476
-I don't need you here, Rembrandt.
-Well…


401
00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:04.630
the man who signs the checks
thought differently.


402
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:05.662
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.


403
00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:06.870
And why is that?

404
00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:08.550
Oh, I don't know.

405
00:49:08.764 --> 00:49:11.470
Maybe it's because you killed Vohl
without asking his permission.


406
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:13.750
Vohl knew everything,
he was a direct connection.


407
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:15.430
Would've folded like a tent.

408
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:19.990
You… yes, kill me, you're all the same:
shoot first and ask questions later.


409
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:23.277
And hold off on those
enhanced interrogation techniques.


410
00:49:23.535 --> 00:49:25.423
I want her clear-headed in the morning.

411
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:31.670
He'll break her tomorrow.

412
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:33.590
Maybe he broke her already.

413
00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:38.219
The old man is desperate
to know what she knows.


414
00:49:40.865 --> 00:49:44.794
I wonder how it'd feel if his boy wonder
ends up killing her before he finds out.


415
00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:49.030
I'm guessing he'll look
for a new boy wonder.


416
00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:46.903
Just when we were getting
to know each other.


417
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:50.350
I've got teams at the airport,
shipyard and train station.


418
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:54.350
She's not gonna run, she's gonna lick
her wounds. Then she's coming after you.


419
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:55.750
Good.

420
00:51:56.830 --> 00:51:57.270
Really?

421
00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:02.430
Cause right now it's 4:0. She's wining.

422
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:11.990
Where do you buy your suits?

423
00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:14.270
Cause I've got a
cousin as big and tall

424
00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:15.750
and he's a hard time.

425
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:19.830
Nobody's home.

426
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:25.270
Well, I can get you to the border.

427
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:28.190
London may not be safe
for you right now.


428
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:35.310
This is Vietnam, Anna,

429
00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:36.710
you know what's it like here.

430
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:39.110
You owe it to Moody to stay alive.

431
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:42.830
I know what I owe him.

432
00:52:55.009 --> 00:52:56.131
<i>Go.</i>

433
00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:00.434
The fuck you think
I gave you the money fo--


434
00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:13.470
End of the line, kid.

435
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:29.070
Get in!

436
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:31.270
Watch out!

437
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:34.990
Moody was beautiful,

438
00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:37.750
in his way.

439
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:40.240
He was kind.

440
00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:44.310
And not through effort,
it was just a part of who he was.


441
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:48.870
He didn't save my life,
he gave me a life.


442
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:55.176
He knew who I was, what I've become.

443
00:53:55.484 --> 00:53:57.710
And he protected me.

444
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:07.270
Hayes has been dead for thirty years,

445
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:08.670
Vohl was gone longer.

446
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:12.030
You've got some very bad people
looking for you.


447
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:15.390
Lucas Hayes killed Moody,
he knows I'm looking for him.


448
00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:18.390
His last known location
is St. Quiteria Hospital.


449
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:23.630
Nobody is as deaf as those
who don't wanna listen.


450
00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:35.510
<i>Hello, Ms. Nguyen.</i>

451
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:39.219
It's been some time since we've had
a visit from the Ministry of Health.


452
00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:41.190
And to request records
from that far back…


453
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:42.279
Yes, I know.

454
00:55:42.365 --> 00:55:44.789
We're hoping to find something
in there that will help us


455
00:55:44.857 --> 00:55:48.081
rule out environmental factors,
cause we are in the midst of a study.


456
00:55:48.127 --> 00:55:48.736
Thank you.

457
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:51.830
Lucas Hayes, well before my time here.

458
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:59.389
2 5 8 5 0
2 4 5 8 6.

459
00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:01.590
<i>Copy, I'll get Doc on it.</i>

460
00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:02.390
Okay.

461
00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:22.590
<i>Doc came through, pulled his records.</i>

462
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:23.550
And?

463
00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:29.350
<i>Sit down: Lucas Hayes was admitted
to St. Quiteria on 2nd June, 1999,</i>


464
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:32.469
<i>and according to his records never left.</i>

465
00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:37.390
I apologize, seems the boy was
re-admitted under the name Christian.


466
00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:39.710
Christian, right,
his mother's maiden name.


467
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:41.430
He was already here when I arrived,

468
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:43.416
been a patient
for more than twenty years.


469
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:49.950
He doesn't like to be touched.

470
00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:52.470
He can't speak. 
Also deaf and blind.

471
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:56.270
And how long has he been like this?

472
00:56:56.750 --> 00:57:00.190
He was diagnosed when he was six,
I believe, it regressed rapidly.


473
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:02.710
It's a miracle he's lived as long.

474
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:04.950
And who pays for his care?

475
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:07.872
We have a generous endowment.

476
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:10.270
Everyone here is treated for free.

477
00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:18.710
<i>Wow! Four men dead, nothing on camera.</i>

478
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:20.270
<i>Place looks like an abattoir.</i>

479
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:21.350
<i>Was it the food?</i>

480
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:23.270
You know, it was bad manners.

481
00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:25.119
Yeah, well, that's no
way to treat a lady.

482
00:57:25.227 --> 00:57:26.510
I'm no lady.

483
00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:28.128
Not that I was a gentleman myself.

484
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:29.790
I wouldn't sell yourself short.

485
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:32.350
<i>Coming from you, that's a compliment.</i>

486
00:57:32.850 --> 00:57:34.310
I'm in the middle of something--

487
00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:36.790
Hey, how were good sisters
of the St. Quiteria?


488
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:43.987
Good enough to let me know
I've been looking for the wrong person.


489
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:44.950
<i>Good gals out there.</i>

490
00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:47.242
St. Quiteria, do you know who she was?

491
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:50.950
Fifteen years old, she led a guerrilla war
against the Roman legions.


492
00:57:51.623 --> 00:57:52.208
Bad ass.

493
00:57:52.308 --> 00:57:54.390
They chopped off her head
and fed the rest to the dogs.


494
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:56.030
Again, bad manners.

495
00:57:56.070 --> 00:57:59.870
Hey, you up for a dinner? I could answer
some questions and save you some time.


496
00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:02.670
<i>What do say if we say La Cinq?
Tomorrow night, eight o'clock.</i>


497
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:04.976
I mean you can say it.
But I won't be there.


498
00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:07.510
I'll give you the time and place.

499
00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:12.230
You're intrigued by her.

500
00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:14.710
Curious.

501
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:16.350
Need I worry?

502
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:27.550
The gala list, sir,

503
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:31.070
The joys of a room full of
the wealthy and the privileged


504
00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:33.430
donating large sums for a noble cause.

505
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:35.750
Never gets old.

506
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.750
Good.

507
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:44.550
Why did you do this?

508
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:47.909
It's what people in my position
are supposed to do, Michael.


509
00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:50.230
Give to the less fortunate.

510
00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:52.510
I asked if I should be worried.

511
00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:54.670
About the woman.

512
00:58:54.927 --> 00:58:57.847
Nope. Not yet.

513
00:58:58.110 --> 00:59:01.430
Please wrap up
this unpleasantness by Sunday.


514
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:04.790
I don't wanna be embarrassed
before the celebration.


515
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:24.950
Wow.

516
00:59:28.510 --> 00:59:29.249
Thank you, Ben.

517
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:34.510
They know me here.

518
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.870
Cheers.

519
00:59:38.050 --> 00:59:39.461
Someone killed a friend of mine

520
00:59:39.561 --> 00:59:41.978
because of a contract
he completed years ago.


521
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:44.510
And anyone I ask
about it ends up dead.

522
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:45.550
Why is that?

523
00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:48.350
I don't know, but some people
might take it as a sign.


524
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:51.602
Why don't you just consider it
a mystery best left unsolved?


525
00:59:51.727 --> 00:59:53.256
But I like mysteries.

526
00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:57.790
When I started this I was curios.
And then I went from curious to concerned.


527
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.670
And now?

528
00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:00.030
I'm testy.

529
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:03.030
An trust me, you don't wanna
know me when I'm testy.


530
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:09.190
HK 9mm.

531
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:10.590
Very good.

532
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:13.185
Not from where I'm sitting.

533
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:16.399
Who's paying for the orphan kid?
I'd like to talk to whoever that is.


534
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:17.310
That'd be unwise.

535
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:20.550
<i>Unwise</i> is killing a man
who was a second father to me.


536
01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:22.350
We are way past unwise.

537
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:24.310
This is a really
bad place for a hit.

538
01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:28.670
High-end restaurant, the security
at every exit, not to mention the cameras.


539
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:31.030
You know what, you already knew that.

540
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:32.510
Oh, I'm not here to kill you…

541
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:36.230
Yet. Just to get answers.

542
01:00:36.651 --> 01:00:37.830
You always ask like this?

543
01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:40.470
Yeah, I like to have peoples' attention
when I talk, you know?


544
01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:40.950
Well…

545
01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:45.470
you certainly have the attention
of the boys down there.


546
01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:49.270
Look, you're gonna have to put
at least three in me to be sure.


547
01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:50.110
Four.

548
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:52.778
Fine. That leaves you with five.
In case there's trouble


549
01:00:52.878 --> 01:00:54.827
You think that's enough
to get you out of here?


550
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:59.150
Four quick shots and then the slow walk
to the exit amongst the chaos. Yeah.


551
01:01:01.070 --> 01:01:02.870
Something unexpected could happen.

552
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:05.350
You know, it usually does.

553
01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:10.270
SIG 226, it's got that great kick.

554
01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:11.510
Yeah.

555
01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:19.830
How about that.
Our first awkward silence.


556
01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:23.950
You know what, 
I didn't get your name.

557
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.790
Anna.

558
01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:25.350
Pleasure.

559
01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:26.270
We'll see.

560
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:30.150
What do you say we forget these tricks.

561
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:32.510
Let's just go for a nice hotel.

562
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:37.350
You point a gun at my pussy
and then you ask me to bed?


563
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:39.630
I like your style.

564
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:42.390
Said the woman with hollow-points
pointed at my balls.


565
01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:45.845
Well, let's hope this doesn't get messy,
These are my favorite shoes.


566
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:48.230
Manolo's, classic four inch pumps.

567
01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:51.950
A man who knows Poe and footwear.

568
01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:57.390
Let me put this to you delicately,

569
01:01:58.390 --> 01:02:00.350
you keep this up, you're gonna die.

570
01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:03.110
Vietnam has always been a place of death.

571
01:02:03.790 --> 01:02:06.310
Only lucky ones make it out alive.
I was lucky once.


572
01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:07.750
You don't get lucky twice.

573
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:10.950
I'm going to find out
who killed my friend.


574
01:02:11.350 --> 01:02:12.190
And when you do?

575
01:02:12.790 --> 01:02:16.310
I'm going to end their life,
and anyone standing in my way.


576
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:21.590
Thank you for a lovely evening.

577
01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:25.190
Hey, I know it sounds crazy,

578
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:27.870
but I'd really like to see you again

579
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:31.590
under, you know, different circumstances.

580
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:33.390
This was personal time.

581
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:37.270
So these are the best circumstances
you'll ever see me in.


582
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:20.150
Speak.

583
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:25.310
Call me when it's done.

584
01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:34.532
I thought you're off
chasing corrupt accountants.


585
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:38.070
I found a hotel room with all
of her shit, including her passport.


586
01:03:38.350 --> 01:03:40.110
Name's Nadia Zhukova.

587
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:42.310
An Asian Russian.

588
01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:43.550
Boy.

589
01:03:44.310 --> 01:03:46.824
You don't really see that ever.

590
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:50.366
Good work, you must be exhausted, huh?

591
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:08.470
Looks like I'm a day late.

592
01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:11.390
<i>And a dollar short.
Didn't take much I'm afraid.</i>


593
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:12.790
He sang like a bird, didn't he?

594
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:14.790
<i>All of the things I know now.</i>

595
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:18.110
<i>I know who your boss is,
the man who sanctioned Moody's killing.</i>


596
01:07:21.150 --> 01:07:22.150
He's a big fish.

597
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:24.030
<i>More fun when you hook him.</i>

598
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:25.630
Well, then I guess…

599
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:29.070
I guess we'll be seeing
each other real soon then.


600
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:30.950
<i>Sooner than you think.</i>

601
01:07:31.110 --> 01:07:32.550
<i>Hey, what happened to your hand?</i>

602
01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:31.870
Make up your mind:

603
01:09:32.629 --> 01:09:35.223
kill me or fuck me?

604
01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:49.702
It's so weird that we're
in this guy's bed while he's…


605
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:51.870
up there.

606
01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:54.190
You know, hanging.

607
01:09:57.190 --> 01:09:57.910
No.

608
01:09:58.490 --> 01:09:59.910
Would be a waste of a nice bed.

609
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:01.790
Okay.

610
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:07.774
How long have you been doing this?

611
01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:10.270
Not, you know, this, but…

612
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:11.750
Long enough not to miss.

613
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:13.990
You got lucky.

614
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:16.430
Nah.

615
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:18.510
You don't want me dead.

616
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:20.310
Yet.

617
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:23.150
Why haven't you killed me?

618
01:10:24.150 --> 01:10:24.950
Could you?

619
01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:31.405
I could put two in the back of your head
and go make a sandwich.


620
01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:34.830
Well.

621
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:39.590
You always said
this wasn't gonna work out.


622
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:41.030
No.

623
01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:45.629
It's been my experience, it never does.
At least not for the other guy.


624
01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:47.950
Have a way around that?

625
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:49.830
You are holding all the cards.

626
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:55.709
I'm watching a woman
who walk over a shark tank


627
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:58.110
on a tight rope in high winds.

628
01:10:59.549 --> 01:11:01.368
You're not gonna make it, Anna.

629
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:03.790
He's a bad man.

630
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:06.030
Who's done very bad things.

631
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:52.950
So, you just gonna lay there?

632
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:02.070
Good to see you, kid.

633
01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:09.629
Get in. Get out.

634
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:12.709
You know you only get lucky once.

635
01:12:12.910 --> 01:12:15.110
Yeah. Someone else just told me that.

636
01:12:15.150 --> 01:12:15.870
Okay.

637
01:12:18.233 --> 01:12:19.330
God!

638
01:12:19.425 --> 01:12:22.189
-Just a little glue. Just a little glue.
-What's wrong with you!


639
01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:23.950
It's okay, grit your teeth.

640
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:26.030
Oh, God.

641
01:12:26.230 --> 01:12:28.750
You know, I still feel
really bad about Claudia.


642
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:32.790
She couldn't cook worth a shit,
but she didn't deserve to die like that.


643
01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:36.270
Here we go.

644
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.830
Okay.

645
01:12:37.670 --> 01:12:39.110
Okay, okay. We're done here.

646
01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:42.990
Did you really think
they can kill me that easily?


647
01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:57.310
Before I blew the rest of it off he didn't
have much of a face to begin with.


648
01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:05.910
And I left just enough of me
for the authorities to think it was me.


649
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:09.150
I'm sorry you had
to be the one who found him.


650
01:13:13.670 --> 01:13:15.590
You could always think
on your feet anyway.


651
01:13:16.190 --> 01:13:17.549
Not so much tonight.

652
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:20.470
That's what friends are for, right?

653
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:24.110
Oh, good. We're friends again.

654
01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:31.510
You got laid, didn't you?

655
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:44.709
Depending more and more on this shit

656
01:13:45.549 --> 01:13:47.030
to take the edge off.

657
01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:54.910
So, what's the plan?

658
01:13:58.810 --> 01:14:00.595
Four hundred acres, to get there

659
01:14:00.695 --> 01:14:03.427
you'd have to hike through 12 miles
of rat-infested jungle.


660
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:07.470
That leaves the river,
cameras, sonar, patrol boats.


661
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:09.670
Still a pessimistic little shit,
aren't you?


662
01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:12.150
And you're still a cockroach
you can't kill.


663
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:13.910
I mean it in a good way.

664
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:18.110
They know you're coming.

665
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:19.750
What is this?

666
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:23.830
It's a panic room,
in this case it's a panic bunker.


667
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:27.150
If he gets in there, you're done.

668
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:29.790
All the guests arrive by boat,

669
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:32.070
they'll be screened
a moment they disembark.


670
01:14:32.230 --> 01:14:34.030
Perimeter locked down and site secured.

671
01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:38.870
And I've added an additional team
of 16 out of Israel just for the night.


672
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:40.629
Seems like you got everything covered.

673
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.629
Michael.

674
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:44.070
Thoughts?

675
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:47.430
Venice.

676
01:14:48.990 --> 01:14:50.629
It's really nice this time of year.

677
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:53.230
You should go. Now.

678
01:14:56.150 --> 01:14:58.390
These guys have no idea
who they're dealing with.


679
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:33.470
<i>Copy that.</i>

680
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:56.870
You look a little tense.

681
01:16:58.270 --> 01:17:01.670
I've protected everyone
from crowned princes to cartel kingpins.


682
01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:05.622
Nothing's gonna happen tonight
especially when we know what she looks like.


683
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:09.310
Boy…

684
01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:11.830
I really hope you got paid upfront.

685
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:18.350
Sir.

686
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:43.390
Anything?

687
01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:46.477
Nothing so far. Sectors one,
two and three are clear.


688
01:17:46.577 --> 01:17:48.665
I'm waiting on the reports
from sector four.


689
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:32.110
Thank you.

690
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:38.110
It is with great pleasure that I welcome
you all here on this very expensive evening.


691
01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:42.629
It warms my crusty heart to look across
the room and see so many familiar faces,


692
01:18:42.670 --> 01:18:45.590
dear friends, and close
business associates.


693
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:50.629
As well as quite a few unfamiliar faces
that with luck will not remain so for long.


694
01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:54.443
Perhaps I may even have spotted
a few former foes of mine.


695
01:18:55.513 --> 01:18:57.522
I want especially to thank you for coming,

696
01:18:57.670 --> 01:19:00.709
and for seeing the error of your ways.

697
01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:04.629
Over these considerable years
I've learnt to my great satisfaction


698
01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:08.270
there is no better
way to cleanse the soul

699
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:10.629
than to do good,
to perform selfless deeds.


700
01:19:10.629 --> 01:19:14.350
and acts of kindness,
to sacrifice for others,


701
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:17.709
and most importantly to give generously.

702
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:20.629
It is due to your generous spirit

703
01:19:20.629 --> 01:19:22.910
that we've been able to enrich and enhance

704
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:26.057
the lives of so many infants,
children, young men and women


705
01:19:26.157 --> 01:19:27.709
in desperate need of care

706
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:32.070
to a degree that would have been impossible
to achieve without every one of you.


707
01:19:32.190 --> 01:19:36.910
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for
the privilege of being your host tonight.


708
01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:41.470
And for allowing me to slide my hands
into your pockets and purses,


709
01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:44.652
but for a worthy a cause.

710
01:19:44.856 --> 01:19:48.670
The sisters of St. Quiteria
do outstanding work… So…


711
01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:51.310
…Give with your heart.

712
01:23:09.390 --> 01:23:14.310
You look really good for a man
who's been dead thirty years, Mr. Hayes.


713
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:16.709
How'd you get in here?

714
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:25.310
Technology.
It just gonna fuck us all one day.


715
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:27.709
Who are you?

716
01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:30.181
I'm the big bad wolf
that comes to get you

717
01:23:30.281 --> 01:23:33.532
when someone on this Earth
decides your time is up.


718
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:36.790
Moody.

719
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:44.549
Resurrection is a bitch, ain't it?

720
01:23:45.370 --> 01:23:47.270
You've come to finish the job,
haven't you?


721
01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:51.670
Well, you did hire me
all those years ago to kill you, right?


722
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:03.709
Who was really in that car?

723
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:07.270
Does it matter? Disposable asset.
No one of any consequence.


724
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:13.950
You see, that's the kind of shit
I expect someone like you to say.


725
01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:17.549
"No one of any consequence."

726
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:20.070
"Someone like me"?

727
01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:22.670
Man, I can't be all morally right.

728
01:24:22.830 --> 01:24:26.270
I kill people for a living,
bad people, mind you, but still.


729
01:24:26.910 --> 01:24:28.790
I never pretend to be anything else.

730
01:24:29.519 --> 01:24:33.950
You, you're front and center
of a dozen high-profile charitable causes.


731
01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:38.820
The world sees you as clean
as first fucking snow.


732
01:24:40.150 --> 01:24:41.910
But your hands are covered in shit.

733
01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:46.709
Blood, everything from from sarin gas
to human trafficking.


734
01:24:48.549 --> 01:24:51.830
So you know why
I had to arrange my demise.


735
01:24:58.709 --> 01:25:00.110
I had a son,

736
01:25:00.549 --> 01:25:02.350
unexpected in many ways.

737
01:25:03.230 --> 01:25:05.750
But what I couldn't fathom
was the depths of love


738
01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:07.361
I had for this child,

739
01:25:08.281 --> 01:25:11.830
this imperfect, wonderful, vulnerable boy.

740
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:16.870
If I were dead, Lucas would be free
from any threats or harm.


741
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:18.070
Bullshit.

742
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:21.549
You may love your son, Mr. Hayes,

743
01:25:22.446 --> 01:25:26.016
but that was your chance to disappear.

744
01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:31.190
You're very astute.

745
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:33.670
No one looks for a dead man.

746
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:38.670
I was able to continue behind the shroud
of respectability that allowed me to--


747
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:40.549
To become a bigger monster.

748
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:43.549
The irony of all of this, Mr. Hayes,

749
01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:46.750
is that I was just trying
to make amends to your son


750
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:48.590
for taking his father away from him.

751
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:52.629
You brought all of this on yourself.

752
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:12.830
Anna.

753
01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:24.310
You don't look so good.

754
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:25.590
I don't know.

755
01:26:26.230 --> 01:26:30.183
Nothing an Apple Martini
and a liter of AB positive won't fix, huh?


756
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:35.310
Hey, what do you think
the chances are of me getting either?


757
01:26:35.670 --> 01:26:36.470
Faint.

758
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:43.910
Something funny?

759
01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:46.830
I find it amusing you think
you're better than me.


760
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:49.670
Not better.

761
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:51.470
Different.

762
01:26:56.150 --> 01:26:58.510
You see, most people are good, Mr. Hayes.

763
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:04.830
Then occasionally they do something
they know is bad.


764
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:09.750
Some people are bad, and they struggle
every day to keep it under control.


765
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:14.950
Others… corrupt to the core and just
don't give a damn, that would be me.


766
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:17.110
But evil…

767
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:24.590
Evil is a completely different
creature, Mr. Hayes.


768
01:27:25.549 --> 01:27:31.470
Evil believes bad is okay,
its actions are justified.


769
01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:33.830
Violence divorced from conscience,

770
01:27:33.870 --> 01:27:37.870
no matter what toll it takes
or who it takes it upon.


771
01:27:38.110 --> 01:27:43.030
And there, my friend,
is where we part ways.


772
01:27:45.150 --> 01:27:48.670
I'm just a bad man
who's looking to pay for his sins.


773
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:51.750
I see.

774
01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:56.150
So you are here to clear
your conscience first then?


775
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:08.830
You'll never get out of here alive.

776
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:14.430
I never intended to.

777
01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:19.830
One more thing.

778
01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:23.230
You could have killed the old man.

779
01:28:23.670 --> 01:28:24.430
Why didn't you?

780
01:28:26.549 --> 01:28:28.070
That wasn't the plan.

781
01:29:15.646 --> 01:29:18.049
ANNA: IT'S BEEN A BLAST.
LOCATION


782
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.870
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

783
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:56.870
<i>No! No!</i>

784
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:02.950
<i>No! Mom!</i>

785
01:30:18.670 --> 01:30:20.390
<i>Mom!</i>

786
01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:30.270
What took you?

787
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:31.950
Just out for a bite.

788
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:41.750
You just gonna stand there?

789
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:44.510
For now.

790
01:34:48.670 --> 01:34:50.310
It doesn't have to be this way, Anna.

791
01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:52.310
Not anymore.

792
01:34:54.150 --> 01:34:56.230
We all have to pay
for our sins eventually.


793
01:34:57.790 --> 01:34:59.030
Doesn't have to be today.

794
01:35:00.150 --> 01:35:01.230
I'm tired.

795
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:03.670
