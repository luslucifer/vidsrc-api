1
00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:36.960
- Oh, he is so cute.
- So cute.


2
00:01:37.036 --> 00:01:38.901
<i>Make my dreams come true</i>

3
00:01:38.972 --> 00:01:41.406
<i>Take me away</i>

4
00:01:41.474 --> 00:01:42.668
Look.

5
00:01:42.742 --> 00:01:45.540
<i>'Cause falling in love</i>
<i>ain't very far</i>


6
00:01:45.612 --> 00:01:48.706
If marshmallows were a boy,
they'd so be Ritchie.


7
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:51.545
Oh, gosh!
Less lusting, more chugging.


8
00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:56.582
You two are so beyond lame.

9
00:01:56.656 --> 00:01:59.056
Hi, sis. Get out.

10
00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:01.423
Oh, look! You're having
a date with your TV.


11
00:02:02.562 --> 00:02:03.859
And piles of trash.

12
00:02:05.698 --> 00:02:06.858
This isn't trash!

13
00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:09.993
This is a highly organized system
of bottles and labels.


14
00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.970
See, we're doing
this 5 Leo Rise shift label drive,


15
00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:15.064
and the school
that collects the most labels


16
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:16.870
gets to have the band
come to the school!


17
00:02:16.943 --> 00:02:19.503
And the kids that collected
the most labels get to meet the band,


18
00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.012
talk to the band,
look at the band...


19
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.377
Shut up!

20
00:02:22.448 --> 00:02:25.576
You know, after spending
a semester in Italy,


21
00:02:25.652 --> 00:02:28.086
American boys
just don't do it for me anymore.


22
00:02:28.154 --> 00:02:30.019
Excuse me, girl gone wild,

23
00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:31.954
why don't you take
your sexploits and go?


24
00:02:32.025 --> 00:02:33.117
We're busy.

25
00:02:33.192 --> 00:02:34.318
Gladly, loser.

26
00:02:36.195 --> 00:02:37.253
Hey, Devon.

27
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:40.356
- Is that my T-shirt?
- No.


28
00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:41.559
Yeah, it is!

29
00:02:42.935 --> 00:02:45.836
I want it off and in my room
in five minutes, or you're so dead.


30
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.871
I can't believe my parents are leaving
me alone with her for the weekend!


31
00:02:50.943 --> 00:02:53.741
Well, she doesn't have
to take it out on Mason!


32
00:02:53.813 --> 00:02:55.474
<i>Love at first sight</i>

33
00:03:01.688 --> 00:03:03.952
So, what are you going to say
to Mason when you meet him?


34
00:03:04.023 --> 00:03:05.456
Oh, don't jinx it!

35
00:03:05.525 --> 00:03:07.550
- We're so gonna lose. I know it!
- Are you kidding?


36
00:03:07.627 --> 00:03:09.561
You've been snipping labels
morning, noon, and night,


37
00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.221
volunteering
at the recycling center...


38
00:03:11.297 --> 00:03:12.662
Not just for the labels.

39
00:03:12.732 --> 00:03:15.098
Recycling is important
for the future of our planet.


40
00:03:15.168 --> 00:03:17.762
Gabs, relax.
We got this concert in the bag.


41
00:03:31.718 --> 00:03:33.618
What the hell are you doing
in my locker?


42
00:03:33.686 --> 00:03:35.950
Nothing. "Ritchie loves
hanging out with his friends,


43
00:03:36.022 --> 00:03:37.956
grabbing a bite to eat
after every show."


44
00:03:38.024 --> 00:03:39.013
Give it!

45
00:03:40.026 --> 00:03:42.085
That's some fascinating stuff
you're reading there.


46
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:44.925
Tell me, Lincoln, when does
the breaking-and-entering phase


47
00:03:44.997 --> 00:03:46.487
of your obnoxious little life end?

48
00:03:46.566 --> 00:03:49.091
Right after you get over
these lip-synching wussies.


49
00:03:49.168 --> 00:03:50.999
- I mean, look.
- They don't lip-synch!


50
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.162
That's just weird.

51
00:03:52.238 --> 00:03:53.865
What's on the schedule
for today, Pete?


52
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.340
I'm downloading the latest
masterpiece onto the Internet.


53
00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.036
The Hesterson High
goat kidnapping.


54
00:03:58.111 --> 00:03:59.339
You heard about that, right?

55
00:03:59.412 --> 00:04:01.846
We snatched their mascot
in, like, three minutes flat,


56
00:04:01.914 --> 00:04:03.176
and we got it all on tape.

57
00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:04.841
Check it out.

58
00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:07.750
<i>This is Pete, and this is</i>
<i>the Hesterson goat kidnapping.</i>


59
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.913
<i>- I got him!</i>
<i>- Go! Go! Go! Go!</i>


60
00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.219
That's awesome.
That's enough.


61
00:04:13.226 --> 00:04:15.285
I'm telling you, when that baby
goes up on my website,


62
00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:17.226
I'm going to get, like,

63
00:04:17.296 --> 00:04:18.957
The chicks are going to be on me.

64
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:21.761
- Pranks are lame.
- Baby girl, don't be jealous.


65
00:04:21.834 --> 00:04:25.065
Look, me and you, we'll always
have our thing, you know?


66
00:04:25.138 --> 00:04:26.628
I mean, our chemistry's like this.

67
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.938
Especially after we had
our first little bath together.


68
00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:31.340
I was two years old, you freak.

69
00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:34.005
I know, but you kept grabbing
for my rubber ducky and stuff...


70
00:04:35.014 --> 00:04:37.244
Mention it again and you're dead.

71
00:04:37.316 --> 00:04:40.149
Whoa, you got to be
a little bit more gentle with me.


72
00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:41.516
I'm fragile, all right?

73
00:04:41.587 --> 00:04:43.020
- You getting this on tape?
- Got it.


74
00:04:43.523 --> 00:04:47.755
So, look, we still on
for homecoming or what?


75
00:04:53.633 --> 00:04:55.624
We'll talk about it later.
It's cool.


76
00:04:55.701 --> 00:04:57.362
She's just holding out
for the limo.


77
00:04:57.437 --> 00:04:58.495
Yeah.

78
00:05:01.941 --> 00:05:03.340
Two more times.

79
00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:05.070
Lincoln is so my nemesis.

80
00:05:05.144 --> 00:05:07.169
Still, he did ask you
to homecoming.


81
00:05:08.181 --> 00:05:10.945
I'm just saying,
I wish I had a nemesis to ask me.


82
00:05:15.154 --> 00:05:17.088
Excuse you.

83
00:05:17.156 --> 00:05:19.317
Oh, hi, Kira. Nice shoes.

84
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.555
Did I tell you to stop running?

85
00:05:23.062 --> 00:05:24.188
Not you, Gabs.

86
00:05:25.198 --> 00:05:26.597
Kira, what do you want?

87
00:05:26.666 --> 00:05:29.567
As president
of the student council,


88
00:05:29.635 --> 00:05:32.035
I'm heading up
the 5 Leo Rise label drive


89
00:05:32.104 --> 00:05:33.366
this afternoon,

90
00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:37.205
and since you two don't have
anything better to do with...


91
00:05:37.276 --> 00:05:39.642
your pathetic little lives...

92
00:05:39.712 --> 00:05:42.203
- You guys are lame.
- I know.


93
00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:45.045
I'm expecting
a lot of labels from you two.


94
00:05:45.117 --> 00:05:46.106
Okay?

95
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.754
I cannot wait to meet

96
00:05:49.822 --> 00:05:51.050
Lainey!

97
00:05:53.192 --> 00:05:55.683
God, did you hear that?
We have not been scouring


98
00:05:55.761 --> 00:05:57.922
garbage cans and Dumpsters
for the last few weeks


99
00:05:57.997 --> 00:06:00.864
just so those two glamazons
can take all the credit.


100
00:06:01.834 --> 00:06:04.166
So, that's how she stays so fit.

101
00:06:15.114 --> 00:06:18.641
Come on! People!
We need more labels, okay?


102
00:06:18.718 --> 00:06:20.447
Today is the last day.

103
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.818
- The last day.
- Yeah.


104
00:06:25.458 --> 00:06:26.618
- Who's...
- What?


105
00:06:26.692 --> 00:06:28.455
Excuse me.

106
00:06:29.462 --> 00:06:31.123
Who is that?

107
00:06:31.197 --> 00:06:33.427
- Is that a garbage truck?
- Gross.


108
00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:35.490
I know. Stinky.

109
00:06:46.145 --> 00:06:47.305
Watch your feet!

110
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.144
Official school business.
Coming through!


111
00:06:50.216 --> 00:06:52.207
We're totally going to win this!

112
00:06:55.388 --> 00:06:58.186
This is... our contribution.

113
00:06:58.257 --> 00:06:59.884
How many are there?

114
00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:03.690
Well, we lost count after
the first few hundred thousand,


115
00:07:03.763 --> 00:07:07.358
but if you take the gross tare weight
and divide it by.37 ounces for the...


116
00:07:07.433 --> 00:07:08.422
Okay, okay, okay.

117
00:07:08.501 --> 00:07:10.833
Save the soliloquy, learner's permit.
We need a number.


118
00:07:10.903 --> 00:07:14.532
- 519,672.
- Approximately.


119
00:07:14.607 --> 00:07:15.665
Wow.

120
00:07:16.676 --> 00:07:20.976
Can I just say that you two are, like,
the coolest sophomores ever?


121
00:07:21.047 --> 00:07:22.036
Ever, yeah.

122
00:07:23.049 --> 00:07:25.108
- And I totally mean that.
- She does.


123
00:07:25.184 --> 00:07:26.742
Not so fast.

124
00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:28.514
We get to be a part
of the presentation,


125
00:07:28.588 --> 00:07:30.215
and we get to meet the band...

126
00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:31.415
or no labels.

127
00:07:36.596 --> 00:07:37.961
Fine.

128
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.023
Ladies and gentlemen,

129
00:07:44.637 --> 00:07:48.038
<i>Good morning, everybody.</i>
<i>You are listening to 97.1.</i>


130
00:07:48.107 --> 00:07:52.976
<i>Where is DJ Tricky Trent?</i>
<i>Why, he's at Highland High School!</i>


131
00:07:55.881 --> 00:08:00.147
Yo, yo, what's up?
Yeah! Oh!


132
00:08:01.153 --> 00:08:03.018
Yeah, I love your enthusiasm.

133
00:08:03.089 --> 00:08:05.057
DJ Tricky Trent in the hizzee!

134
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.218
Loving you!

135
00:08:09.295 --> 00:08:11.923
Splashing around a bucket of love,
and it's landing right on you.


136
00:08:12.598 --> 00:08:14.896
Highland High School,
let me hear you scream!


137
00:08:18.804 --> 00:08:21.898
Breathe and believe,
breathe and...


138
00:08:21.974 --> 00:08:23.305
- Gabby.
- Breathe...


139
00:08:23.376 --> 00:08:24.809
- Gabby. Gabby.
- Yeah.


140
00:08:24.877 --> 00:08:26.401
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.


141
00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:30.882
It's just a little mantra to keep me
from freaking out with nervousness.


142
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:31.974
Excuse me.

143
00:08:33.586 --> 00:08:36.487
- Hey... Kira.
- What?


144
00:08:36.555 --> 00:08:40.389
I just thought it would be a cool idea
if we just had some sparklers


145
00:08:40.459 --> 00:08:41.983
when the curtains opened.

146
00:08:43.596 --> 00:08:48.761
Gabby, this is high school,
not the Fourth of freakin' July, okay?


147
00:08:50.803 --> 00:08:52.464
Lainey, come on.

148
00:08:52.538 --> 00:08:54.267
Okay, I tried.

149
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.705
She didn't like it.
I didn't like it.


150
00:08:55.775 --> 00:08:57.675
It was a bad idea.
I should never have said anything.


151
00:08:57.743 --> 00:08:58.732
- Gabby.
- What?


152
00:08:58.811 --> 00:08:59.800
Give me that sparkler.

153
00:09:01.814 --> 00:09:04.977
Yeah, I think...
I think I'm perfect.


154
00:09:05.051 --> 00:09:07.042
- Like, so good.
- Like, more than perfect.


155
00:09:07.119 --> 00:09:08.814
- Way perfect.
- What would you call that?


156
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.289
Cool.

157
00:09:12.358 --> 00:09:15.816
Cheerleader Kira Castle
and Lainey Fox!


158
00:09:28.908 --> 00:09:30.671
Her hair! The labels!

159
00:09:31.177 --> 00:09:33.338
Fire extinguisher.
Fire extinguisher!


160
00:09:35.347 --> 00:09:36.473
Kira, drop and roll!

161
00:09:36.549 --> 00:09:38.608
- Drop and roll!
- Can we open that curtain, please?


162
00:09:53.232 --> 00:09:55.632
I don't know if those burnt labels
are going to count.


163
00:09:55.701 --> 00:09:56.963
It was Gabby!

164
00:09:57.036 --> 00:09:58.628
She did it!

165
00:10:11.083 --> 00:10:13.381
Come on, Gabs, yell at me.

166
00:10:13.452 --> 00:10:14.942
Say something.

167
00:10:15.955 --> 00:10:17.718
All I feel is peace.

168
00:10:18.724 --> 00:10:20.157
It can't get any worse.

169
00:10:22.161 --> 00:10:24.026
I'll make it up to you, I swear.

170
00:10:24.096 --> 00:10:27.361
Thanks, but I've been branded "loser"
for the rest of my life.


171
00:10:27.433 --> 00:10:30.163
You're going to be late for chem lab,
and you know how upset you get


172
00:10:30.236 --> 00:10:32.227
when you don't have
your favorite Bunsen burner.


173
00:10:42.615 --> 00:10:45.379
Oh, thatagirl.

174
00:10:49.955 --> 00:10:51.684
Okay, coast is clear.
Come on.


175
00:10:55.795 --> 00:10:58.423
Where do you think you're going,
you little soph-whores?


176
00:10:58.497 --> 00:10:59.896
The other way.

177
00:10:59.965 --> 00:11:02.729
Excuse me.
Kira's talking to you.


178
00:11:04.003 --> 00:11:05.061
Keep going, keep going.

179
00:11:05.137 --> 00:11:06.195
You can't escape me.

180
00:11:06.272 --> 00:11:07.899
Not that way. Oh, gosh.

181
00:11:07.973 --> 00:11:09.031
Check it out.

182
00:11:12.044 --> 00:11:14.444
Hi, Kira. Cute scarf.

183
00:11:14.513 --> 00:11:17.038
Don't try to suck up to me
after what you did.


184
00:11:17.116 --> 00:11:18.947
Actually it was my fault.
Gabby didn't...


185
00:11:19.952 --> 00:11:22.420
I know what happened.
Nice try, Girl Scout.


186
00:11:22.488 --> 00:11:24.115
I was there.

187
00:11:25.191 --> 00:11:26.715
She had the sparklers.

188
00:11:27.793 --> 00:11:30.626
Me too.
I'm, like, a witness.


189
00:11:30.696 --> 00:11:31.924
But the...

190
00:11:31.997 --> 00:11:35.262
But... but... but what, Gabby?

191
00:11:35.334 --> 00:11:38.633
I am going to have to get
hair extensions now.


192
00:11:38.704 --> 00:11:40.934
Do you have any idea
how much that costs?


193
00:11:41.006 --> 00:11:42.974
Not nearly as much
as it will be to fix your face.


194
00:11:43.042 --> 00:11:45.067
I don't know,
but I could pay you back.


195
00:11:45.144 --> 00:11:46.907
I could set up a payment plan

196
00:11:46.979 --> 00:11:50.813
and even include damages
for pain and suffering.


197
00:11:52.818 --> 00:11:54.752
"Pain and suffering"?

198
00:11:55.754 --> 00:11:58.416
That is, like, so <i>Law and Order,</i>

199
00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:01.618
but that's not going to work
for me, Gabby.


200
00:12:01.694 --> 00:12:03.491
She doesn't like it.

201
00:12:03.562 --> 00:12:08.795
From now on, Gabby Davis,
your life at Highland High is over.


202
00:12:08.868 --> 00:12:10.165
She's finished.

203
00:12:11.537 --> 00:12:13.471
Whatever. You can't just...

204
00:12:13.539 --> 00:12:16.269
That goes for you too.
Duh.


205
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:19.502
Lainey.

206
00:12:21.647 --> 00:12:23.012
Losers!

207
00:12:23.082 --> 00:12:24.447
Shove off, Gabby.

208
00:12:24.516 --> 00:12:25.778
Thanks a lot.

209
00:12:25.851 --> 00:12:26.840
Hate you, Devon.

210
00:12:33.325 --> 00:12:35.589
We should consider homeschooling.

211
00:12:35.661 --> 00:12:37.788
Don't worry.
Kira's all talk.


212
00:12:37.863 --> 00:12:40.093
"Don't worry."
Don't worry?


213
00:12:40.165 --> 00:12:44.568
Hello, Godzilla in a cheerleader skirt
declared social war on us.


214
00:12:44.637 --> 00:12:45.865
Gabs, we'll be fine.

215
00:12:58.384 --> 00:12:59.510
Losers.

216
00:12:59.585 --> 00:13:02.110
I'm telling you, Gabs,
this is all going to blow over.


217
00:13:02.187 --> 00:13:03.176
You'll see.

218
00:13:03.255 --> 00:13:06.019
People have really short
attention spans.


219
00:13:06.091 --> 00:13:07.422
Nice work, idiots.

220
00:13:09.361 --> 00:13:11.761
Cute accessories, girls.

221
00:13:14.633 --> 00:13:16.498
Losers!

222
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.110
You know, I really feel
it hasn't been that bad.


223
00:13:29.915 --> 00:13:30.973
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.


224
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.517
I'm totally fine.

225
00:13:33.819 --> 00:13:35.480
Okay.

226
00:13:39.658 --> 00:13:43.424
We are the biggest losers
in the history of the universe, Devon.


227
00:13:43.495 --> 00:13:45.895
Future civilizations
will conduct studies


228
00:13:45.965 --> 00:13:48.126
on just how pathetic we were.

229
00:13:50.703 --> 00:13:53.900
We need to think big, Gabs,
bigger than Kira.


230
00:13:53.973 --> 00:13:55.634
We need to do
something so freaking cool,


231
00:13:55.708 --> 00:13:58.142
it won't even matter
what Kira and Lainey say about us.


232
00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:59.370
Is this where you tell me

233
00:13:59.445 --> 00:14:02.073
you just discovered
your teenage superpowers, Buffy?


234
00:14:05.651 --> 00:14:06.913
Update.

235
00:14:09.455 --> 00:14:10.786
Do you see that?

236
00:14:10.856 --> 00:14:12.619
I'm trying not to freak out.

237
00:14:12.691 --> 00:14:14.022
Gabs, that's today.

238
00:14:15.761 --> 00:14:17.456
Great.

239
00:14:17.529 --> 00:14:21.431
Great, so we'll just take off,
go meet 5 Leo Rise,


240
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.024
convince them to play
for the school,


241
00:14:23.102 --> 00:14:26.333
everyone will love us,
and the Kira curse will be over.


242
00:14:28.474 --> 00:14:30.704
That is the most genius idea ever.

243
00:14:30.776 --> 00:14:32.767
Yeah, except I was joking.

244
00:14:32.845 --> 00:14:34.176
Well, I'm not.

245
00:14:34.246 --> 00:14:35.270
What?

246
00:14:44.056 --> 00:14:47.617
You know, ladies...
and dude...


247
00:14:47.693 --> 00:14:49.558
your love
really keeps the band going.


248
00:14:49.628 --> 00:14:52.096
So let's keep going, shall we?
Come on, let's hurry, please.


249
00:14:52.164 --> 00:14:54.189
I can't believe
you convinced me to skip school.


250
00:14:54.266 --> 00:14:56.029
I've never done anything
like this before.


251
00:14:56.101 --> 00:14:57.090
Gabby, focus.

252
00:14:57.169 --> 00:14:59.000
We need to get the band
to play for our school,


253
00:14:59.071 --> 00:15:00.902
or we'll be stuck
in social Siberia forever.


254
00:15:02.007 --> 00:15:03.634
How are we going to convince them?

255
00:15:06.445 --> 00:15:08.970
Remember when 5 Leo Rise
took that leukemia girl to her prom?


256
00:15:09.048 --> 00:15:10.345
Yeah.

257
00:15:10.416 --> 00:15:12.646
- We'll just say you have cancer.
- That is so wrong!


258
00:15:12.718 --> 00:15:14.618
Do you want to be
Kira's punching bag forever?


259
00:15:16.021 --> 00:15:18.285
- Look nauseous.
- I'm so nervous I'm going to throw up.


260
00:15:18.357 --> 00:15:19.756
- Good.
- What?


261
00:15:19.825 --> 00:15:23.158
- You kind of look like you have cancer.
- So fine!


262
00:15:23.228 --> 00:15:24.217
Hi, who's next?

263
00:15:24.296 --> 00:15:26.287
- Hey, how you doing? I'm...
- Oh, my God, Ritchie, hi.


264
00:15:26.365 --> 00:15:28.162
It's me, Devon.
I'm your biggest fan ever.


265
00:15:28.233 --> 00:15:29.860
- My best friend here, Gabby Davis.
- Hi.


266
00:15:29.935 --> 00:15:32.529
Remember her name, 'cause one day
she'll be a famous scientist.


267
00:15:32.604 --> 00:15:35.971
She collected all these labels
to win the concert for our school,


268
00:15:36.041 --> 00:15:39.442
but they accidentally set on fire
along with a popular girI's hair.


269
00:15:39.511 --> 00:15:41.274
If I don't do serious damage control,

270
00:15:41.346 --> 00:15:42.938
these bitches are going to
ruin our social lives,


271
00:15:43.015 --> 00:15:45.210
so can 5 Leo Rise please
come play at Highland High?


272
00:15:45.284 --> 00:15:48.082
Absolutely.
We'll be there tomorrow.


273
00:15:48.921 --> 00:15:51.014
- Really?
- Yeah.


274
00:15:52.057 --> 00:15:55.049
Yeah, we'll ride
into your school on unicorns.


275
00:15:59.465 --> 00:16:01.296
Hey, I'm Mason.

276
00:16:02.568 --> 00:16:05.059
Do you have something
you want me to sign?


277
00:16:05.137 --> 00:16:07.867
No, I don't need an autograph.
I need a concert.


278
00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.498
All right, fair enough.

279
00:16:09.575 --> 00:16:12.703
See that?
If you looked like that...


280
00:16:14.646 --> 00:16:15.544
...maybe I'd say yes.

281
00:16:17.049 --> 00:16:18.209
You all right?

282
00:16:21.253 --> 00:16:22.845
Kind of starting to freak me out.

283
00:16:25.424 --> 00:16:26.584
Gabs.

284
00:16:26.658 --> 00:16:27.920
Duh...

285
00:16:28.727 --> 00:16:29.921
I have cancer.

286
00:16:29.995 --> 00:16:32.691
Well... we didn't give it to you.

287
00:16:32.764 --> 00:16:34.595
No. See, Ritchie,
this is really important.


288
00:16:34.666 --> 00:16:37.100
This is a matter of life and death,
and I'm your biggest fan.


289
00:16:37.169 --> 00:16:38.602
- Would you just...
- Some help here.


290
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.331
You have to.
I bought all of your music.


291
00:16:40.405 --> 00:16:41.394
I bought all of it!

292
00:16:41.473 --> 00:16:44.271
...money for my hair,
and it's really sad.


293
00:16:44.343 --> 00:16:45.605
Oh, my God, let me go!

294
00:16:45.677 --> 00:16:47.611
Don't you touch her.
Ritchie!


295
00:16:49.414 --> 00:16:51.882
Crazy psycho fans, man.

296
00:16:59.791 --> 00:17:05.161
You mean, when I said I had cancer,
Mason didn't do anything?


297
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.164
Not even a glance.

298
00:17:07.232 --> 00:17:09.325
Gosh, that is so unlike him.

299
00:17:09.401 --> 00:17:13.235
No. It's all a lie, Gabs.
They're all fakes.


300
00:17:13.305 --> 00:17:14.294
Even Mason.

301
00:17:15.841 --> 00:17:17.604
So you're telling me that my life

302
00:17:17.676 --> 00:17:19.667
is just going to be
one big giant ball of suck.


303
00:17:19.745 --> 00:17:21.337
Listen to me.

304
00:17:21.413 --> 00:17:23.176
When you run
into the aggros of the world...


305
00:17:23.248 --> 00:17:25.876
I'm beginning to think
that there's a lot of them out there...


306
00:17:25.951 --> 00:17:26.940
you have to fight back,

307
00:17:27.019 --> 00:17:28.919
or people are just going
to bully you forever.


308
00:17:31.957 --> 00:17:33.015
Come on, do it.

309
00:17:37.563 --> 00:17:39.724
- I hate you, Mason.
- Good. Do it again.


310
00:17:40.866 --> 00:17:42.891
- Hate you, Mason!
- Come on, mean it this time!


311
00:17:42.968 --> 00:17:43.957
I hate you, Mason!

312
00:17:44.036 --> 00:17:46.869
- I hate every penny I spent on you.
- That's right, they owe us.


313
00:17:46.939 --> 00:17:48.736
- And they're going to pay.
- How?


314
00:17:51.877 --> 00:17:54.345
We're going to kidnap the band
and force them to play.


315
00:17:54.413 --> 00:17:55.778
Yeah.

316
00:17:56.548 --> 00:17:58.743
Wait. No.
That's probably not the best idea.


317
00:17:58.817 --> 00:18:00.808
It's the only way and you know it.

318
00:18:00.886 --> 00:18:03.946
As for you, Ritchie,
you are so over.


319
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:15.361
I, Devon Thompson, do solemnly swear
to adhere to the following rules.


320
00:18:15.434 --> 00:18:19.200
Number one, I promise to not have
any boys in the house.


321
00:18:19.271 --> 00:18:22.104
Number two,
I promise not to skip school.


322
00:18:22.174 --> 00:18:25.541
Number three, I promise
not to drive the car. There, that's it.


323
00:18:26.678 --> 00:18:28.407
You left that last part out.

324
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.970
I'm boycotting the last part.

325
00:18:30.048 --> 00:18:32.642
A boycott's not an option,
cupcake.


326
00:18:33.318 --> 00:18:34.615
Fine.

327
00:18:34.686 --> 00:18:38.281
I swear to recognize Danielle
as in charge while you're gone.


328
00:18:38.357 --> 00:18:40.257
Why does she get to be in charge?
Look at her.


329
00:18:41.226 --> 00:18:44.093
Because you can't even be trusted
to drag a bunch of labels onstage


330
00:18:44.162 --> 00:18:46.460
without setting them on fire.

331
00:18:46.531 --> 00:18:47.520
You retard.

332
00:18:47.599 --> 00:18:48.793
Okay, girls.

333
00:18:48.867 --> 00:18:51.392
The phone number to McCune
Mystery Manor is on the fridge.


334
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:52.869
Please try to get along.

335
00:18:52.938 --> 00:18:55.406
Your father and l
are really excited about this.


336
00:18:55.474 --> 00:19:00.036
It's a weekend of fine dining,
intrigue, and murder.


337
00:19:00.112 --> 00:19:02.580
Where everyone's a suspect.

338
00:19:05.117 --> 00:19:06.709
Bye.

339
00:19:14.593 --> 00:19:15.821
Gabs.

340
00:19:18.997 --> 00:19:20.430
- Let's go.
- Okay.


341
00:19:32.244 --> 00:19:35.077
Hello. Lincoln's been
expecting you. Come on in.


342
00:19:54.132 --> 00:19:57.397
Here it is,
where the magic happens.


343
00:20:05.977 --> 00:20:06.966
That's it, I'm out.

344
00:20:07.045 --> 00:20:08.307
Oh, don't, okay?

345
00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:12.009
Remember, he's never been caught,
and he would do anything for you.


346
00:20:12.084 --> 00:20:14.814
So you ladies ready to talk
a little business or what?


347
00:20:14.886 --> 00:20:19.346
Well, Lincoln, I'm a...
great admirer of your work.


348
00:20:19.424 --> 00:20:20.516
Big fan.

349
00:20:20.592 --> 00:20:22.116
Indulge me.
How do you do it?


350
00:20:22.194 --> 00:20:25.027
Well, first I come up with an idea.

351
00:20:25.097 --> 00:20:29.158
Then I do a little R&D...
that's research and development.


352
00:20:29.234 --> 00:20:30.258
Then I plan it out.

353
00:20:30.335 --> 00:20:33.099
Great, 'cause Gabby and I think
you're ready for something bigger.


354
00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:36.538
- Huge.
- Something... legendary.


355
00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:39.741
Like what?

356
00:20:39.811 --> 00:20:41.278
Oh, I don't know...

357
00:20:43.248 --> 00:20:45.910
kidnapping 5 Leo Rise
after their concert on Saturday?


358
00:20:49.187 --> 00:20:51.052
You can't be serious.

359
00:20:51.123 --> 00:20:52.784
All right, no.

360
00:20:52.858 --> 00:20:54.849
This chitchat's been great, ladies,
you know?


361
00:20:54.926 --> 00:20:55.915
It's time to go.

362
00:20:55.994 --> 00:20:57.655
Gabby, I told you.
He's no legend.


363
00:20:57.729 --> 00:21:00.163
Wait, hold on.
I'm as legendary as it gets,


364
00:21:00.232 --> 00:21:02.632
but what you're talking about
is a real crime.


365
00:21:02.701 --> 00:21:05.636
You remember lan Fuller?
He tried to hack into the Pentagon.


366
00:21:05.704 --> 00:21:08.002
He was 17,
but they tried him as an adult.


367
00:21:08.073 --> 00:21:09.802
Now he's spending
his college years


368
00:21:09.875 --> 00:21:12.343
behind bars
in an orange jumpsuit,


369
00:21:12.411 --> 00:21:14.436
and... I don't look
too good in orange.


370
00:21:14.513 --> 00:21:16.378
Oh, I guess you're right, Devon.

371
00:21:16.448 --> 00:21:18.882
Wait. So you expect me
to get locked up


372
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.111
so you guys can meet
your boy band boyfriends?


373
00:21:21.186 --> 00:21:22.847
They aren't our boyfriends.

374
00:21:22.921 --> 00:21:24.218
- Yeah, we hate them.
- Hate.


375
00:21:24.289 --> 00:21:25.551
We want to humiliate them.

376
00:21:25.624 --> 00:21:27.751
If Gabby and I have to do this solo,
then we will.


377
00:21:28.693 --> 00:21:29.682
It's interesting.

378
00:21:30.228 --> 00:21:32.355
So you still got that basement,
right, Devon?


379
00:21:33.365 --> 00:21:34.832
And when do your parents get back?

380
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:35.889
Tuesday.

381
00:21:39.204 --> 00:21:41.263
See, now I know
what you're capable of


382
00:21:41.339 --> 00:21:43.603
with the whole
setting-Kira's-hair-on-fire thing.


383
00:21:43.675 --> 00:21:45.870
"Oh! Oh, my God!
My hair!"


384
00:21:45.944 --> 00:21:47.935
It was good. I liked it.

385
00:21:48.013 --> 00:21:51.107
But you guys are definitely going
to need my genius to pull this off.


386
00:21:52.451 --> 00:21:53.383
I'm in.

387
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.218
I can't wait to see the look
on those wussies' faces.


388
00:21:59.558 --> 00:22:01.549
Yeah. I love your skin.

389
00:22:02.394 --> 00:22:05.158
- So soft.
- And I'm done here.


390
00:22:06.264 --> 00:22:07.526
I'm going to let them out.

391
00:22:10.368 --> 00:22:11.562
She needs me.

392
00:22:19.611 --> 00:22:21.909
Lincoln, how did you get this?

393
00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.572
He never reveals his sources.

394
00:22:25.517 --> 00:22:28.975
Okay, welcome
to Operation Taking 5.


395
00:22:29.054 --> 00:22:30.419
In the next 24 hours,

396
00:22:30.489 --> 00:22:33.515
we'll have our game faces on
and our eyes on the prize.


397
00:22:33.592 --> 00:22:34.889
Now, this is how it's going to go.

398
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.866
<i>At 8:00 sharp,</i>
<i>we arrive at my house,</i>


399
00:22:41.933 --> 00:22:44.265
<i>looking good and ready to hop</i>
<i>in the homecoming limo.</i>


400
00:23:00.886 --> 00:23:02.547
At 10:15,

401
00:23:02.621 --> 00:23:06.216
when those wussies are doing
their final encore performance,


402
00:23:06.291 --> 00:23:08.156
<i>we arrive at the backstage exit.</i>

403
00:23:09.928 --> 00:23:12.328
<i>According to my research,</i>
<i>immediately after the show</i>


404
00:23:12.397 --> 00:23:14.888
<i>the band is rushed</i>
<i>into a waiting limo.</i>


405
00:23:14.966 --> 00:23:16.695
<i>Why shouldn't it be ours?</i>

406
00:23:19.137 --> 00:23:20.331
Devon, Gabby,

407
00:23:20.405 --> 00:23:22.270
this is where you guys come in
with phase two.


408
00:23:22.974 --> 00:23:23.963
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

409
00:23:24.042 --> 00:23:25.532
Distraction.

410
00:23:33.485 --> 00:23:35.646
<i>The place was on fire.</i>

411
00:23:37.722 --> 00:23:39.189
<i>Ladies.</i>

412
00:23:39.824 --> 00:23:42.816
<i>Now, you ladies are going to use</i>
<i>your feminine charms</i>


413
00:23:42.894 --> 00:23:44.725
<i>to divert the band's attention.</i>

414
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.492
Then we move
into phase three... chaos.


415
00:23:48.567 --> 00:23:49.932
<i>Pete's going to handle that.</i>

416
00:23:55.674 --> 00:23:57.369
<i>In the midst of all the confusion,</i>

417
00:23:57.442 --> 00:23:59.603
<i>you ladies are going to lead them</i>
<i>towards our limo,</i>


418
00:23:59.678 --> 00:24:01.168
<i>where I'll be waiting to escort them.</i>

419
00:24:01.246 --> 00:24:02.543
Wait a minute.

420
00:24:02.614 --> 00:24:05.105
But if it's all smoky, how are we
even going to see them?


421
00:24:07.419 --> 00:24:09.182
<i>The pièce de résistance.</i>

422
00:24:34.045 --> 00:24:36.707
Not even in your fantasies,
Lincoln.


423
00:24:39.284 --> 00:24:40.945
- One more thing, Devon.
- What?


424
00:24:41.019 --> 00:24:43.044
You're going to be my date
for homecoming.


425
00:24:44.489 --> 00:24:47.322
Good one. I'm not going
to homecoming with you.


426
00:24:47.392 --> 00:24:49.826
I know it seems funny and all,
but seriously.


427
00:24:49.894 --> 00:24:53.295
See, my mom's not going to rent me
a limo if I'm dateless.


428
00:24:53.365 --> 00:24:54.559
And she wants pictures.

429
00:24:55.667 --> 00:24:57.828
Oh, my gosh, Devon,
you're going to homecoming.


430
00:24:57.902 --> 00:24:59.233
Only as a decoy, Gabs.

431
00:24:59.304 --> 00:25:01.465
Still... homecoming.

432
00:25:01.539 --> 00:25:02.801
Yes.

433
00:25:04.342 --> 00:25:05.969
Lincoln, look at Devon, honey.

434
00:25:06.978 --> 00:25:09.208
That's a doozy.
Lift your chin, Lincoln.


435
00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.441
Mom, uh, just take the picture,
all right?


436
00:25:11.516 --> 00:25:14.212
It has to be perfect.
My little boy's going to homecoming.


437
00:25:14.285 --> 00:25:15.650
Let me look.

438
00:25:21.426 --> 00:25:23.257
Look it, look.
Look, smile.


439
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:26.419
Sweet.

440
00:25:29.367 --> 00:25:30.493
This is great.

441
00:25:34.906 --> 00:25:37.966
Good night, Mr. Limo Man.
Sweet dreams.


442
00:25:38.043 --> 00:25:39.271
Get in.

443
00:25:39.344 --> 00:25:40.902
Nice limo, right?

444
00:25:40.979 --> 00:25:42.344
I've got to get out of this dress.

445
00:25:44.182 --> 00:25:46.309
If you look when I'm changing,
I'm going to hurt you.


446
00:25:49.854 --> 00:25:50.946
Turn around!

447
00:25:54.392 --> 00:25:56.883
Hey, limo guy.
You ready?


448
00:25:57.896 --> 00:25:58.988
- Yeah.
- Good.


449
00:26:07.138 --> 00:26:08.765
Can I see
some identification, please?


450
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.468
No problem, man.
I've got that right here.


451
00:26:13.812 --> 00:26:15.746
Oh, man.
So you're with the band?


452
00:26:15.814 --> 00:26:17.042
Yeah, man, with the band.

453
00:26:17.115 --> 00:26:19.640
Sweet. What's that like,
hanging out with them and stuff?


454
00:26:19.718 --> 00:26:22.516
It's cool, man.
Crazy pop stars, crazy fans.


455
00:26:22.587 --> 00:26:24.282
I sing too.
I actually wrote them a song.


456
00:26:24.355 --> 00:26:26.880
I'm not going to sing the whole thing,
but the chorus is all...


457
00:26:26.958 --> 00:26:29.722
<i>5 Leo Rise...</i>

458
00:26:29.794 --> 00:26:31.386
Dude, I've got the demo
back in the car.


459
00:26:31.463 --> 00:26:33.863
Let me just run and grab it,
you hand it over to them, and...


460
00:26:33.932 --> 00:26:34.921
You can't be serious.

461
00:26:34.999 --> 00:26:37.524
I'm running late. Can you open
the gate, please? Thanks.


462
00:26:37.602 --> 00:26:40.127
Sure. Let him in, he's cool.
Go on, get out of here, man.


463
00:26:40.205 --> 00:26:42.036
- Good luck with that singing career.
- Yeah.


464
00:26:44.008 --> 00:26:46.101
- Hey, Pete?
- Yeah.


465
00:26:46.177 --> 00:26:47.667
Is he going to be okay?

466
00:26:49.614 --> 00:26:52.139
Yeah, he's just sleeping.
He'll be up in a couple hours.


467
00:26:52.217 --> 00:26:53.206
Don't worry about it.

468
00:26:59.124 --> 00:27:01.183
Yeah, Hollace.
Great.


469
00:27:01.259 --> 00:27:03.853
They're on the encore right now.

470
00:27:03.928 --> 00:27:06.226
Okay. I'll have them out in five.

471
00:27:22.247 --> 00:27:24.374
Everybody, positions!
Quickly.


472
00:27:32.957 --> 00:27:35.289
Kidnap my heart, Ritchie!

473
00:27:36.795 --> 00:27:39.628
Yo, you guys catch that
big-haired blonde in the first row?


474
00:27:39.697 --> 00:27:41.426
I had eye contact all night.

475
00:27:41.499 --> 00:27:42.693
I saw that chick.

476
00:27:42.767 --> 00:27:44.325
Did you see her, Ritchie?

477
00:27:44.402 --> 00:27:46.893
You should be paying less attention
to the chicks in the crowd


478
00:27:46.971 --> 00:27:48.700
and more attention
to your dance moves.


479
00:27:48.773 --> 00:27:50.934
Come on, man,
what's your problem tonight?


480
00:27:51.009 --> 00:27:52.977
Nothing, if you guys'd
just learn your steps.


481
00:27:53.044 --> 00:27:54.033
Whatever, man.

482
00:27:54.112 --> 00:27:57.570
Only missed one move.
Covered.


483
00:27:57.649 --> 00:27:58.707
Amateurs.

484
00:28:06.524 --> 00:28:09.391
Shoot. The other limo's here.
Phase one, go, go, go.


485
00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:11.655
- Okay, Gabs, come on.
- Okay.


486
00:28:11.729 --> 00:28:12.957
- Good luck.
- Thanks.


487
00:28:16.701 --> 00:28:18.464
Oh, man.
What did you do?


488
00:28:21.539 --> 00:28:22.528
That's not right.

489
00:28:22.607 --> 00:28:23.972
Let's go.
Come on, let's go.


490
00:28:26.711 --> 00:28:28.804
- What the hell?
- Where's security?


491
00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.405
Am I the only one who can do
anything right around here?


492
00:28:31.482 --> 00:28:32.449
Let's go.

493
00:28:32.517 --> 00:28:33.745
Ritchie, I love you.

494
00:28:33.818 --> 00:28:35.945
You're so cute.
Oh, my God.


495
00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.112
I love you!

496
00:28:37.188 --> 00:28:38.120
Hey, how's it going?

497
00:28:38.189 --> 00:28:39.816
Can I please have an autograph?

498
00:28:39.891 --> 00:28:41.791
Hey, I'm Mason.

499
00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.684
So many...

500
00:28:44.929 --> 00:28:47.090
Damn! Let's go.

501
00:28:50.735 --> 00:28:51.724
Oh, no.
Oh, no.


502
00:28:51.803 --> 00:28:52.792
Oh, no, no, no...

503
00:28:52.871 --> 00:28:53.769
Gabby, please.

504
00:28:53.838 --> 00:28:56.306
- Guys, I got your limo right here.
- Who the hell are you?


505
00:28:56.374 --> 00:28:57.568
Who the hell cares?

506
00:28:57.642 --> 00:29:00.236
That limo, now!
Go! Go!


507
00:29:00.311 --> 00:29:02.245
- Shoot.
- Man down!


508
00:29:02.313 --> 00:29:03.905
Man down!
Gabby, please.


509
00:29:03.982 --> 00:29:05.040
<i>Five-twenty in sector B.</i>

510
00:29:05.116 --> 00:29:07.482
We've got a code red
at the loading docks. Let's go.


511
00:29:08.753 --> 00:29:11.347
Lincoln, how could you
do this to me? Help me!


512
00:29:11.422 --> 00:29:12.514
What the heck happened?

513
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:13.921
I don't know.
She passed out!


514
00:29:13.992 --> 00:29:15.425
You're going to have to drive.

515
00:29:15.493 --> 00:29:17.290
- What? I don't know how to drive.
- It's easy.


516
00:29:17.362 --> 00:29:19.626
Brake pedaI's left,
gas pedal right. Okay, go! Go!


517
00:29:23.001 --> 00:29:25.561
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God...


518
00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.400
Okay, what do I do?

519
00:29:35.179 --> 00:29:37.306
- Shoot, my goggles.
- Leave them, let's go!


520
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:40.708
- All right, kid.
- Oh, shoot.


521
00:29:40.785 --> 00:29:42.377
Go, Pete!
Tell her to go without me.


522
00:29:42.453 --> 00:29:43.943
Good luck!

523
00:29:44.022 --> 00:29:46.286
Devon, we've got to move!
Code red! Code red!


524
00:29:46.357 --> 00:29:48.188
Pete, be quiet.
I can't concentrate.


525
00:29:49.894 --> 00:29:51.020
Get out of the car!

526
00:29:51.095 --> 00:29:53.290
Don't yell at me!
I can't do it with you yelling at me!


527
00:29:53.364 --> 00:29:54.991
Stop this car!

528
00:29:55.066 --> 00:29:57.626
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God...


529
00:29:57.702 --> 00:29:59.499
5 Leo Rise, don't go, guys!

530
00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:02.004
5 Leo Rise, don't go!

531
00:30:02.073 --> 00:30:04.337
Why would you let them go?
They're my favorite group.


532
00:30:04.409 --> 00:30:05.433
Kid, you...

533
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:07.637
you have really got to get a life,
buddy.


534
00:30:08.813 --> 00:30:11.646
What town are we in?
Our fans here are out of control.


535
00:30:11.716 --> 00:30:14.514
Dude, I think
some chick fainted back there.


536
00:30:14.585 --> 00:30:15.882
You guys hungry?

537
00:30:15.954 --> 00:30:18.980
I think there's a Winger's right there.
Want to make it a wing night?


538
00:30:19.057 --> 00:30:20.991
American buffalo spice wing.

539
00:30:21.059 --> 00:30:22.185
Yeah, man.

540
00:30:23.127 --> 00:30:24.651
Yo, limo dude.

541
00:30:24.729 --> 00:30:27.857
Hey, we're making
a stop for wings.


542
00:30:34.439 --> 00:30:36.873
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God!


543
00:30:37.842 --> 00:30:41.141
Oh, my God.
My mom's going to kill me.


544
00:30:45.717 --> 00:30:47.981
- What?
- Hey, Dev, are you okay?


545
00:30:48.052 --> 00:30:50.520
- Yeah, what happened?
- We blew it! We lost Lincoln.


546
00:30:50.588 --> 00:30:52.852
Oh, my God,
his mom is going to kill me.


547
00:30:52.924 --> 00:30:53.913
We lost Lincoln?

548
00:30:53.992 --> 00:30:56.552
Look, Lincoln's a pro.
He can handle it. It's okay.


549
00:30:56.627 --> 00:30:59.187
Dev, sweetie, listen.
It's going to be okay.


550
00:30:59.263 --> 00:31:01.424
We're at Winger's.
You want wings?


551
00:31:01.499 --> 00:31:02.932
- Wings are good.
- You love wings.


552
00:31:03.001 --> 00:31:05.094
- I hate wings.
- You love wings.


553
00:31:05.169 --> 00:31:06.966
- That's true, I do love wings.
- Okay.


554
00:31:27.992 --> 00:31:29.084
Did you just see that?

555
00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:33.922
5 Leo Rise.

556
00:31:33.998 --> 00:31:35.625
You guys want to go try
to find a party?


557
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.930
Oh, dude,
the parties are all free.


558
00:31:38.002 --> 00:31:39.299
What about Nikolai?

559
00:31:42.106 --> 00:31:43.767
Forget him.

560
00:31:43.841 --> 00:31:47.242
Whoa,
limo driver dude is passed out.


561
00:31:47.311 --> 00:31:48.642
- Partied out.
- What the hell?


562
00:31:48.713 --> 00:31:50.010
- He's crashed.
- I got his hat.


563
00:31:50.081 --> 00:31:52.140
I got to turn it
into a party night for sure.


564
00:31:52.216 --> 00:31:54.184
- Yeah, man.
- What is this?


565
00:31:54.252 --> 00:31:56.015
Somebody's got the right idea.

566
00:31:56.087 --> 00:31:59.022
All right,
you get in the back with them,


567
00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:00.216
and I'll drive. Go!

568
00:32:01.426 --> 00:32:04.327
Wait! Hold on.
Hold on, okay.


569
00:32:09.233 --> 00:32:10.700
Evening, wussies.

570
00:32:10.768 --> 00:32:12.201
What's going on?

571
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:14.761
There's a bomb in the trunk,
and I can set it off at any second,


572
00:32:14.839 --> 00:32:16.306
so shut up and cooperate.

573
00:32:16.374 --> 00:32:19.207
Guys, no! This is your limo!
This is your limo!


574
00:32:19.277 --> 00:32:20.209
Are you serious, dude?

575
00:32:20.278 --> 00:32:21.939
You think this is some kind of joke?

576
00:32:22.013 --> 00:32:24.038
Look at your limo driver.
He's dead.


577
00:32:24.115 --> 00:32:25.742
What? Oh, man.

578
00:32:25.817 --> 00:32:26.977
Scooter, my shirt.

579
00:32:27.051 --> 00:32:28.018
Let's go.

580
00:32:28.086 --> 00:32:29.451
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

581
00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.215
Get them on!
I don't got time for this!


582
00:32:31.289 --> 00:32:32.586
Hurry up!

583
00:32:32.657 --> 00:32:34.784
What? What, pretty boy?
You got something to say?


584
00:32:34.859 --> 00:32:36.087
Who are you?

585
00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:40.153
We are the RMLF,
the Real Music Liberation Front.


586
00:32:40.231 --> 00:32:42.290
In the name of decent musicians
everywhere,


587
00:32:42.366 --> 00:32:43.958
who actually play instruments,

588
00:32:44.035 --> 00:32:46.503
tonight you're going to meet
your wussy ends.


589
00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:50.874
This is the getaway car?

590
00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:54.601
Pete, you said
your brother had a van.


591
00:32:54.679 --> 00:32:56.943
Yes, but then he had to help
his buddy move,


592
00:32:57.014 --> 00:32:58.311
so he got us a replacement.

593
00:32:58.382 --> 00:33:00.475
You are so lucky
Lincoln isn't here to see this.


594
00:33:00.551 --> 00:33:01.540
This is a disaster.

595
00:33:01.619 --> 00:33:03.553
Just pick one.
Leave him here.


596
00:33:03.621 --> 00:33:05.179
- Pick one?
- Pick one?


597
00:33:05.256 --> 00:33:07.486
Like it's nothing?
We've already missed Nikolai.


598
00:33:07.558 --> 00:33:09.822
If we lose another one,
then they're barely even a band.


599
00:33:09.894 --> 00:33:12.454
- They're barely a band anyway.
- Shut up!


600
00:33:19.103 --> 00:33:23.540
Count out loud and tell everyone,
"The RMLF forever."


601
00:33:25.109 --> 00:33:28.203
One R... MLF.

602
00:33:28.946 --> 00:33:30.504
Two RMLF.

603
00:33:32.083 --> 00:33:33.141
Girls, come on.

604
00:33:47.965 --> 00:33:51.366
...nine RMLF,
ten RMLF...


605
00:33:58.609 --> 00:34:00.770
Dev, are you seeing this?

606
00:34:16.227 --> 00:34:19.924
My parents leave town
and she throws a party.


607
00:34:19.997 --> 00:34:22.522
Yeah, and she didn't even invite us.

608
00:34:24.168 --> 00:34:26.159
Pete, pull up over there.

609
00:34:39.817 --> 00:34:42.308
I can't believe someone
killed Madame Broussard


610
00:34:42.386 --> 00:34:43.910
right under our nose.

611
00:34:43.988 --> 00:34:45.853
I think we should check in
with the girls.


612
00:34:45.923 --> 00:34:47.720
I'm sure they're fine.

613
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.057
We should just call the cops,
have them kick everyone out.


614
00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:56.725
I think we have
three kidnapped 5 Leo Rise members


615
00:34:56.801 --> 00:34:57.825
in the back of Pete's car.

616
00:34:57.902 --> 00:35:00.632
I don't think it's smart
to bring the law into this.


617
00:35:00.705 --> 00:35:01.694
Good point.

618
00:35:01.772 --> 00:35:03.569
We'll bring them in
through the side door.


619
00:35:03.641 --> 00:35:05.131
How?

620
00:35:05.209 --> 00:35:06.699
It's a party.
Who's going to notice?


621
00:35:08.546 --> 00:35:09.740
Okay.

622
00:35:16.887 --> 00:35:20.118
Hey, the chips are...
are over there.


623
00:35:20.191 --> 00:35:22.182
Let's go hang out,
you know?


624
00:35:32.136 --> 00:35:34.900
Whoa, are we at a rave?

625
00:35:34.972 --> 00:35:36.769
If anyone makes a sound,
they're dead.


626
00:35:51.756 --> 00:35:52.814
Hello?

627
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:54.983
Hey, cupcake, checking in.
How's everything?


628
00:35:55.059 --> 00:35:56.526
Everything's great.

629
00:35:56.594 --> 00:35:58.255
<i>Staying out of trouble?</i>

630
00:35:58.329 --> 00:36:00.092
- Absolutely.
- There boys in the house?


631
00:36:02.266 --> 00:36:03.733
- No.
- <i>You see there?</i>


632
00:36:03.801 --> 00:36:06.395
<i>You make fun of your old,</i>
<i>uncool dad,</i>


633
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:08.870
but the oath... the oath works.

634
00:36:12.843 --> 00:36:15.573
- What are you doing at my party?
- It's Dad, for you.


635
00:36:15.646 --> 00:36:19.013
You bit...
Hi, Daddy.


636
00:36:19.083 --> 00:36:20.846
So did you solve the case yet?

637
00:36:20.918 --> 00:36:25.651
No, but the weekend
has just begun.


638
00:36:59.023 --> 00:37:00.957
- Ritchie.
- Mason.


639
00:37:01.025 --> 00:37:03.926
Yo, did you guys see Nikolai?

640
00:37:03.994 --> 00:37:05.393
They didn't get Nikolai.

641
00:37:05.463 --> 00:37:07.397
What? How do you know?

642
00:37:07.465 --> 00:37:09.057
Don't smell him.

643
00:37:09.133 --> 00:37:11.124
Nikolai has a smell.

644
00:37:11.202 --> 00:37:12.669
What did they do with KK?

645
00:37:12.737 --> 00:37:14.432
Dude, I think they took KK away.

646
00:37:14.505 --> 00:37:16.405
What?

647
00:37:16.474 --> 00:37:17.736
Oh, my God.

648
00:37:17.808 --> 00:37:19.969
The RMLF killed KK.

649
00:37:25.116 --> 00:37:27.550
- Pete, what are you doing?
- Having a chocolate strawberry.


650
00:37:27.618 --> 00:37:28.607
Put it down.

651
00:37:28.686 --> 00:37:30.347
- It's a party.
- Put it down!


652
00:37:31.622 --> 00:37:32.748
Okay, what do we do now?

653
00:37:32.823 --> 00:37:35.383
We leave them down there
for a while, get 'em good and scared.


654
00:37:35.459 --> 00:37:37.518
When Lincoln gets back,
we can start the torture.


655
00:37:37.595 --> 00:37:39.620
Great. And when
they're freaked out and scared,


656
00:37:39.697 --> 00:37:41.528
Gabby and I will go down
and offer to save them


657
00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:43.362
as long as they agree to play
for our school.


658
00:37:43.434 --> 00:37:45.129
Right?

659
00:37:45.202 --> 00:37:48.831
Yeah. Save them.

660
00:37:49.874 --> 00:37:52.900
Excuse us for, like, two secs.

661
00:37:58.783 --> 00:38:01.149
- You're totally spacing.
- What?


662
00:38:01.218 --> 00:38:06.417
No, it's... okay, I sort of have
a confession to make.


663
00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:08.549
You know how earlier
when I fainted?


664
00:38:08.626 --> 00:38:09.718
Yeah.

665
00:38:09.794 --> 00:38:12.126
It wasn't because I was scared.

666
00:38:12.196 --> 00:38:13.390
It was because of Mason.

667
00:38:13.464 --> 00:38:15.193
Oh, my God.
What did he do to you?


668
00:38:15.266 --> 00:38:19.794
Nothing. Nothing, he just...
smiled.


669
00:38:20.905 --> 00:38:22.202
I think I love him.

670
00:38:22.273 --> 00:38:23.672
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.


671
00:38:23.741 --> 00:38:24.730
No, you can't.

672
00:38:25.276 --> 00:38:27.642
We agreed!
No crushing on the captives!


673
00:38:27.711 --> 00:38:28.700
We hate them.

674
00:38:28.779 --> 00:38:32.476
I do.
I do, I hate all of them.


675
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:34.074
Everyone except for Mason.

676
00:38:35.252 --> 00:38:36.810
That's it.

677
00:38:36.887 --> 00:38:39.981
Gabby Ann Davis,
you need to dig deep and get tough.


678
00:38:40.057 --> 00:38:43.185
Remember, these guys
are the reason why we're outcasts.


679
00:38:44.862 --> 00:38:46.796
Look, I can't do this
without you, okay?


680
00:38:49.567 --> 00:38:52.229
Now, take it off.
Take him off.


681
00:38:54.605 --> 00:38:56.698
Oh, that off.

682
00:38:56.774 --> 00:38:58.298
- Bye-bye.
- Easy.


683
00:39:07.952 --> 00:39:08.941
Stop it.

684
00:39:12.289 --> 00:39:13.813
God.

685
00:39:13.891 --> 00:39:17.224
Oh, my God, Lincoln.
Thank God you're okay.


686
00:39:17.294 --> 00:39:18.522
Gabby, wake up.
It's Lincoln.


687
00:39:18.596 --> 00:39:19.893
He's here.

688
00:39:19.964 --> 00:39:23.297
Yeah, yeah. You know there's
no situation I can't handle.


689
00:39:23.367 --> 00:39:25.892
But you guys just left me there.
What was that all about?


690
00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:28.962
Thank God I had a little juice left
in my cell phone to call my mom,


691
00:39:29.039 --> 00:39:31.098
who, by the way,
says you don't deserve me.


692
00:39:31.175 --> 00:39:32.199
Oh, God.

693
00:39:32.276 --> 00:39:35.973
Okay, I think we have something
that'll make it up to you.


694
00:39:36.046 --> 00:39:41.382
We have three members
of 5 Leo Rise in the basement.


695
00:39:41.452 --> 00:39:42.510
- Shut up.
- Seriously.


696
00:39:42.586 --> 00:39:45.180
You guys messing with me?
I thought you said it was three of them.


697
00:39:45.256 --> 00:39:47.053
- Yeah. There is.
- Isn't it great?


698
00:39:47.124 --> 00:39:48.716
There's only one of them
down there.


699
00:39:48.792 --> 00:39:50.419
- Funny.
- I'm serious.


700
00:39:52.396 --> 00:39:54.330
There they go in the back.
Let's go get them.


701
00:39:54.398 --> 00:39:55.490
What?

702
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:01.501
Scooter, faster, man! Come on!

703
00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.307
Morning, Mrs. Knipplemeyer!

704
00:40:04.375 --> 00:40:06.605
You're all looking so beautiful.

705
00:40:06.677 --> 00:40:08.144
Morning, Mrs. Knipplemeyer!

706
00:40:08.212 --> 00:40:10.646
Oh, good morning, children.

707
00:40:10.714 --> 00:40:14.150
Those are such lovely...
You be nice to them now, you hear?


708
00:40:14.218 --> 00:40:15.583
Yes, yes, yes.

709
00:40:15.653 --> 00:40:18.645
Hey, Mrs. Knipplemeyer!
How you do?


710
00:40:18.722 --> 00:40:20.280
- Hi.
- Hey.


711
00:40:20.357 --> 00:40:21.619
Morning, Mrs. Knipplemeyer!

712
00:40:21.692 --> 00:40:22.989
Oh, good morning, children.

713
00:40:23.661 --> 00:40:27.495
I know their parents
must be so proud of them.


714
00:40:27.565 --> 00:40:29.465
What's your name, girlie man?

715
00:40:29.533 --> 00:40:30.625
Richard Treziak.

716
00:40:30.701 --> 00:40:32.498
And you're what?

717
00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:35.266
- I'm a total loser wuss.
- Yes, you are.


718
00:40:35.339 --> 00:40:37.864
- Who needs his ass kicked.
- Yes, you do.


719
00:40:42.546 --> 00:40:44.207
And what's your name?

720
00:40:44.281 --> 00:40:45.976
Name's Steven Margiatta, sir!

721
00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:47.574
Don't look at me!

722
00:40:47.651 --> 00:40:49.050
But I go by Scooter,

723
00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:53.146
and I'm a piece-of-crap mama's boy
who stole his name from a Muppet.


724
00:40:54.058 --> 00:40:55.753
Pitiful.

725
00:40:55.826 --> 00:40:56.815
And?

726
00:40:58.095 --> 00:40:59.619
I need my ass kicked.

727
00:40:59.697 --> 00:41:02.359
Yes, you do, especially
for wearing this frickin' mullet.


728
00:41:02.433 --> 00:41:04.128
- What is that?
- It's a faux-hawk, sir.


729
00:41:04.201 --> 00:41:05.862
What the hell is a faux-hawk?

730
00:41:05.936 --> 00:41:07.233
- It's... it...
- Shut up!


731
00:41:09.873 --> 00:41:12.341
What about you, mop top?

732
00:41:12.409 --> 00:41:13.899
My name is Mason.

733
00:41:15.613 --> 00:41:18.582
- I'm a long-haired hippie.
- Yeah.


734
00:41:18.649 --> 00:41:20.412
And?

735
00:41:20.484 --> 00:41:22.281
You can kick my ass?

736
00:41:22.353 --> 00:41:23.752
Yes, I can.

737
00:41:23.821 --> 00:41:25.618
You better say it like you mean it!

738
00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:28.485
- You can kick my ass, man.
- Whatever.


739
00:41:28.559 --> 00:41:31.050
- You getting this on tape?
- Yeah, getting all of it.


740
00:41:34.965 --> 00:41:37.433
I cannot believe that
these jokers went AWOL again.


741
00:41:37.501 --> 00:41:38.866
I just...

742
00:41:40.604 --> 00:41:42.538
Thank God you guys are still here.

743
00:41:42.606 --> 00:41:43.595
Where were you?

744
00:41:43.674 --> 00:41:45.699
The band's been kidnapped.

745
00:41:45.776 --> 00:41:47.403
At least the handcuffs
are a nice touch.


746
00:41:48.479 --> 00:41:51.380
What?
These aren't mine.


747
00:41:51.448 --> 00:41:52.437
Sure.

748
00:41:52.516 --> 00:41:56.111
This group, the RMLF,
they grabbed us after the show.


749
00:41:56.186 --> 00:41:58.711
Oh, no! You mean just like
the unannounced three-day weekend


750
00:41:58.789 --> 00:42:00.814
you guys took
during the Mall of America signing?


751
00:42:00.891 --> 00:42:01.880
It's not like that.

752
00:42:01.959 --> 00:42:04.928
Then it must be like the Orlando
Scooter-is-dead prank.


753
00:42:04.995 --> 00:42:07.259
It's real this time,
it's not a prank,


754
00:42:07.331 --> 00:42:10.323
and they still have
the other three guys.


755
00:42:10.401 --> 00:42:12.767
Can I tell you one thing?

756
00:42:12.836 --> 00:42:14.997
Nikolai here
is starting to feel left out.


757
00:42:15.072 --> 00:42:16.733
He wept all night.

758
00:42:16.807 --> 00:42:18.138
- Liar.
- No, no. He did.


759
00:42:18.208 --> 00:42:21.075
Wept in my arms like a newborn.
What is on your shirt?


760
00:42:24.815 --> 00:42:26.578
It's wing sauce.
Scooter's.


761
00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:29.244
- This is your fault.
- I'm feeling the guilt.


762
00:42:29.319 --> 00:42:30.581
Go write a song or something!

763
00:42:30.654 --> 00:42:32.679
See, the RMLF...

764
00:42:32.756 --> 00:42:35.122
we hate fake musicians
like you guys.


765
00:42:36.293 --> 00:42:40.491
If you were a real musician,
you could play this guitar.


766
00:42:51.742 --> 00:42:53.073
Give me that!

767
00:42:53.143 --> 00:42:55.577
Anybody could do that!
A one-armed midget could do that.


768
00:42:55.646 --> 00:42:57.841
I know old ladies
that can play better than that.


769
00:42:57.915 --> 00:42:59.314
- Erase the tape, Pete.
- Yeah.


770
00:42:59.383 --> 00:43:02.580
Remember, Gabs,
Mason isn't Mason.


771
00:43:02.653 --> 00:43:03.915
He's just some random guy

772
00:43:03.987 --> 00:43:06.478
who thinks humiliating
girls with cancer is funny.


773
00:43:06.557 --> 00:43:10.015
- You hate him.
- I... hate him.


774
00:43:10.094 --> 00:43:12.562
Hey, freak show.
Listen, I'm going out,


775
00:43:12.629 --> 00:43:15.291
so when I get back,
this place better be spotless.


776
00:43:15.365 --> 00:43:17.799
This wasn't my party.
I'm not going to clean up your mess.


777
00:43:20.037 --> 00:43:22.062
That's for crashing
my party last night.


778
00:43:22.139 --> 00:43:23.868
Now, unless you want me to call
Mom and Dad


779
00:43:23.941 --> 00:43:26.535
and tell them that you were the one
with the boys in the house,


780
00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:27.634
you clean up.

781
00:43:27.711 --> 00:43:29.076
Fine.

782
00:43:34.384 --> 00:43:35.783
You hate him. Let's go.

783
00:43:35.853 --> 00:43:36.842
Hate him.

784
00:43:53.904 --> 00:43:55.303
Make it stop!

785
00:43:55.372 --> 00:43:57.966
Ow! Save me!

786
00:43:58.041 --> 00:44:00.100
Which one's next?

787
00:44:00.177 --> 00:44:01.872
You've been at it all day.
It's our turn.


788
00:44:01.945 --> 00:44:03.105
What are you guys about to do?

789
00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:05.944
- We were just getting into it.
- Don't mess this up.


790
00:44:12.856 --> 00:44:15.757
As long as you follow our demands,
you'll make it out alive.


791
00:44:17.127 --> 00:44:18.492
What did you do to KK?

792
00:44:18.562 --> 00:44:21.258
Do as we say
and KK will be fine.

793
00:44:21.331 --> 00:44:24.300
Otherwise our friends here
will tear you limb from limb.


794
00:44:25.636 --> 00:44:28.730
No way. The crazy fans
from the signing?


795
00:44:28.806 --> 00:44:30.103
Your mask!

796
00:44:30.174 --> 00:44:33.200
Were fans. Past tense.

797
00:44:33.277 --> 00:44:35.905
We thought you were sweet
and caring, like in your songs.


798
00:44:35.979 --> 00:44:38.413
- Hey, I'm caring.
- Let me finish!


799
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:41.843
But when we came to you for help,
what did we get?


800
00:44:41.919 --> 00:44:45.013
Yeah, not a "no, thank you"
or a "we'd love to, but we can't."


801
00:44:45.088 --> 00:44:47.056
No, you just had to humiliate us.

802
00:44:47.124 --> 00:44:48.455
You screwed over the wrong fans.

803
00:44:48.525 --> 00:44:51.392
With all the posters
and CDs and T-shirts,


804
00:44:51.461 --> 00:44:55.329
we've spent over $936.47
on 5 Leo Rise.


805
00:44:55.399 --> 00:44:57.629
Now you're going to pay us back.

806
00:44:57.701 --> 00:45:00.670
With a concert for our school.

807
00:45:02.105 --> 00:45:03.663
I wish KK were here.

808
00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:06.368
He would laugh his ass off.

809
00:45:06.443 --> 00:45:09.571
Crazy Chick and Cancer Girl,
together again.


810
00:45:11.281 --> 00:45:12.305
Do you really have cancer?

811
00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:16.813
More like... social cancer.

812
00:45:16.887 --> 00:45:18.445
- Yeah.
- Social cancer.


813
00:45:18.522 --> 00:45:19.887
Yeah, and you guys are the cure.

814
00:45:19.957 --> 00:45:22.448
All you have to do is perform
a couple songs for our school.


815
00:45:22.526 --> 00:45:25.393
That'll trump Kira's popularity
and take us off her torture radar.


816
00:45:25.462 --> 00:45:28.898
Oh, wait, are you trying to say
you two aren't exactly popular?


817
00:45:28.966 --> 00:45:31.127
Because that is shocking.

818
00:45:31.201 --> 00:45:33.863
- Have a heart, bro.
- Yeah, man.


819
00:45:33.937 --> 00:45:37.338
We're their heroes.
I met my hero once.


820
00:45:37.407 --> 00:45:39.068
Snoop D
-O-double
-G.

821
00:45:39.142 --> 00:45:41.110
You met Snoop Dogg?
Sweet!


822
00:45:41.178 --> 00:45:44.147
Hey, man, no hostage bonding.
Put your mask back on!


823
00:45:44.214 --> 00:45:45.647
But he met Snoop Dogg.

824
00:45:45.716 --> 00:45:47.479
And he was really cool.

825
00:45:47.551 --> 00:45:50.213
And if he wouldn't have been,
that would've been a major bummer.


826
00:45:50.287 --> 00:45:52.619
I say we do
it for 'em. I'm in.

827
00:45:53.557 --> 00:45:55.787
That's a yes for Mason.

828
00:45:55.859 --> 00:45:56.848
How about you, Scooter?

829
00:45:59.162 --> 00:46:01.562
I am a little upset
about the whole kidnapping thing.


830
00:46:02.366 --> 00:46:03.390
But...

831
00:46:04.902 --> 00:46:05.891
sure.

832
00:46:05.969 --> 00:46:07.800
I'd do a couple songs
for your school.


833
00:46:09.239 --> 00:46:10.536
- You would?
- You would?


834
00:46:10.607 --> 00:46:11.869
Yeah.

835
00:46:11.942 --> 00:46:14.376
Last night was homecoming
for over half the city.


836
00:46:14.444 --> 00:46:16.708
You want me to contact
every limo service?


837
00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:19.749
I'm sorry, what?
You were saying something stupid?


838
00:46:19.816 --> 00:46:21.408
Yes, that's what I want!

839
00:46:21.485 --> 00:46:23.385
If we can find out
where they went in the limo,


840
00:46:23.453 --> 00:46:25.114
we can get them
and bring them back.


841
00:46:25.188 --> 00:46:26.587
Okay?

842
00:46:26.657 --> 00:46:27.681
Get on it.

843
00:46:27.758 --> 00:46:29.316
You don't have to be so abusive.

844
00:46:29.393 --> 00:46:30.451
Are you kidding me?

845
00:46:30.527 --> 00:46:34.520
Yo. Hold up
with this fan appreciation crap.


846
00:46:34.598 --> 00:46:36.463
I'm still part of this band,

847
00:46:36.533 --> 00:46:38.763
and I do not perform for free.

848
00:46:40.537 --> 00:46:43.529
Do you have any idea how much I get
for doing just one song?


849
00:46:43.607 --> 00:46:46.371
With everything you've put us through,
we've more than paid for it.


850
00:46:46.443 --> 00:46:48.070
You kidnapped us!

851
00:46:48.145 --> 00:46:52.707
Besides, I'm the star of this band.
Without me, you got nothing.


852
00:46:52.783 --> 00:46:55.149
Wait, wait, wait,
what's all this me, me, me business?


853
00:46:55.218 --> 00:46:56.685
What about us?

854
00:46:56.753 --> 00:47:00.314
Guess those rumors about
the solo tour aren't just rumors.


855
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:01.721
You were bound to find out.

856
00:47:01.792 --> 00:47:04.226
Hollace did research,
and I've got the largest fan base.


857
00:47:09.499 --> 00:47:10.966
Oh, are you okay, Scooter?

858
00:47:11.034 --> 00:47:13.400
I'm not okay.

859
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:16.803
5 Leo Rise is like my family,
and it's falling apart.


860
00:47:16.873 --> 00:47:19.364
You guys are like my brothers, man.

861
00:47:21.478 --> 00:47:24.538
Look, if I were to bake
a really good cake,


862
00:47:24.614 --> 00:47:26.206
I'd need the best ingredients.

863
00:47:27.017 --> 00:47:29.076
I'd need the best flour,
and that's you, Ritchie.


864
00:47:29.152 --> 00:47:31.086
Why am I the flour?
You calling me gay?


865
00:47:31.154 --> 00:47:33.019
Scooter, what are you
talking about, man?


866
00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:34.580
Listen, Mason,
you're the sugar,


867
00:47:34.658 --> 00:47:37.650
I'm the eggs, KK's the baking soda,
and Nikolai...


868
00:47:38.662 --> 00:47:40.994
- Nikolai is the butter.
- I'm the butter.


869
00:47:41.064 --> 00:47:42.861
No, no, no, see, I get it.

870
00:47:42.933 --> 00:47:45.299
See, he's saying
that when you bake a cake,


871
00:47:45.369 --> 00:47:48.395
no one really says,
"Oh, this is amazing baking soda,"


872
00:47:48.472 --> 00:47:50.099
or, "Wow, where'd you get
these eggs?"


873
00:47:50.173 --> 00:47:51.697
No, they just love the cake.

874
00:47:51.775 --> 00:47:53.834
That's right.
It's the way it's mixed together.


875
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:55.878
- Yeah.
- That's us.


876
00:47:55.946 --> 00:47:59.507
If you don't get that,
you don't get 5 Leo Rise.


877
00:47:59.583 --> 00:48:01.414
Since when do you know
so much about baking?


878
00:48:01.485 --> 00:48:03.476
My parents own a bakery.
Just leave me alone.


879
00:48:04.154 --> 00:48:06.452
You know what, man?
I'm so over this dude.


880
00:48:06.523 --> 00:48:09.458
I'm going to tell you something
I swore I would never say.


881
00:48:09.526 --> 00:48:12.359
When Hollace came to Orlando
to scout for talent,


882
00:48:12.429 --> 00:48:14.488
he said me and Scooter
were perfect for the band.


883
00:48:14.564 --> 00:48:16.361
Yeah, and I said,
"What about Ritchie?"


884
00:48:16.433 --> 00:48:18.333
You know what Hollace said?

885
00:48:18.402 --> 00:48:22.463
He said your singing Goofy
was derivative and uninspired.


886
00:48:22.539 --> 00:48:26.737
I hope you girls have good lawyers,
because you are so screwed.


887
00:48:29.346 --> 00:48:31.041
Lincoln, we'll be back.

888
00:48:31.114 --> 00:48:32.581
Where you guys going?

889
00:48:33.784 --> 00:48:36.116
What am I supposed to do
with this schmuck, Ritchie?


890
00:48:36.186 --> 00:48:37.949
I've got a few ideas.

891
00:48:38.021 --> 00:48:40.819
Look, we have two yeses.

892
00:48:40.891 --> 00:48:43.485
We need to get inside
Ritchie's head, break him down.


893
00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.687
Well, he thinks
he's the star of the band.


894
00:48:45.762 --> 00:48:47.127
Why don't we treat him like it?

895
00:48:47.197 --> 00:48:48.289
It's worth a shot.

896
00:48:48.365 --> 00:48:52.165
So you read all his articles.
What does he love most?


897
00:48:54.237 --> 00:48:55.795
Banana cream pie.

898
00:48:56.973 --> 00:48:58.668
He likes collecting sneakers.

899
00:49:01.378 --> 00:49:03.403
Oh, and the Velvet Raven.

900
00:49:11.121 --> 00:49:12.645
- There's an idea.
- What?


901
00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:15.888
What's an idea?
Gabby, what's an idea?


902
00:49:15.959 --> 00:49:16.948
So here's the deal.

903
00:49:17.027 --> 00:49:19.757
Every time he says something
stupid, chuck an egg at him.


904
00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:21.195
That's sweet. That's good.

905
00:49:22.732 --> 00:49:24.461
- That hurt!
- You jumped the gun.


906
00:49:24.534 --> 00:49:25.626
I didn't say anything!

907
00:49:25.702 --> 00:49:28.193
You know what? You guys
are definitely an inspiration to me.


908
00:49:28.271 --> 00:49:30.000
I didn't think
you guys would be this cool,


909
00:49:30.073 --> 00:49:31.540
but let me show you how it's done.

910
00:49:34.511 --> 00:49:37.105
Hollace and the label are gonna
find out, and I'm gonna sue.


911
00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:40.115
Oh, yeah?
Well, tell your lawyer I said this.


912
00:49:40.183 --> 00:49:43.584
Watch the face!
Come on, guys!


913
00:49:43.653 --> 00:49:45.314
We should be checking in
with Hollace.


914
00:49:45.388 --> 00:49:48.084
Dude, you're his prize star,
not us.


915
00:49:48.158 --> 00:49:49.591
We don't have to check in anymore.

916
00:49:49.659 --> 00:49:53.220
In fact, think we'll stay here as long
as possible just to freak him out.


917
00:49:53.296 --> 00:49:55.457
Hey, guys, I got this.
I got this.


918
00:49:58.068 --> 00:49:59.831
Did you just miss?

919
00:49:59.903 --> 00:50:01.370
- Your aim is horrible.
- He's...


920
00:50:01.438 --> 00:50:03.872
I'll be back.
You're an embarrassment, Pete.


921
00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:05.202
Try again, Pete.
You got it.


922
00:50:11.815 --> 00:50:15.774
I don't know what you guys are doing,
but we need to get back to the plan.


923
00:50:23.793 --> 00:50:25.920
Actually, Lincoln, the plan changed.

924
00:50:26.997 --> 00:50:30.831
The... that's the Velvet...
Velvet Raven.


925
00:50:32.569 --> 00:50:34.730
You couldn't have busted that out
for homecoming?


926
00:50:36.339 --> 00:50:38.068
Ritchie gets all the good stuff.

927
00:50:38.141 --> 00:50:39.608
Lincoln, focus.

928
00:50:41.344 --> 00:50:44.313
- It's hard.
- Focus! I need your help on this one.


929
00:51:03.066 --> 00:51:04.624
What the hell?

930
00:51:04.701 --> 00:51:05.690
Hi.

931
00:51:08.572 --> 00:51:10.563
Well, okay. Bye.

932
00:51:13.009 --> 00:51:14.169
Go, go, go.

933
00:51:17.747 --> 00:51:18.805
Hey, Ritchie...

934
00:51:20.183 --> 00:51:22.777
I was just roaming the neighborhood,

935
00:51:22.852 --> 00:51:27.414
fighting some crime,
and I thought I'd stop by.


936
00:51:28.425 --> 00:51:30.290
- You're insane...
...ly hot? I know.


937
00:51:33.396 --> 00:51:35.591
Banana cream pie?
Your favorite.


938
00:51:35.665 --> 00:51:37.963
- I'm starving.
- So...


939
00:51:38.969 --> 00:51:41.494
Which one of my super powers
do you love the most?


940
00:51:41.571 --> 00:51:45.268
Is it my famous raven cry,
or is it just the fishnets?


941
00:51:45.342 --> 00:51:48.175
Seriously,
you're putting me off my pie.


942
00:51:48.245 --> 00:51:51.510
Well, I guess
it's just my martial arts skills, then.


943
00:51:51.581 --> 00:51:53.242
Watch it!

944
00:51:55.685 --> 00:51:56.845
God!

945
00:51:58.922 --> 00:52:02.085
Great. What little torture
are you going to inflict on me now?


946
00:52:03.793 --> 00:52:06.193
Just soapy water.
Would you relax?


947
00:52:15.405 --> 00:52:18.738
Look, I just want to know
if there was anything unusual


948
00:52:18.808 --> 00:52:20.503
with any of your limos last night.

949
00:52:20.577 --> 00:52:23.569
Tell you, when I find them,
I'm just going to...


950
00:52:23.647 --> 00:52:26.673
Vomit, yeah.
Grape juice.


951
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:30.242
A limo covered in wing sauce.

952
00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.345
Did you say wing sauce?
Give... give...


953
00:52:32.422 --> 00:52:33.912
All right, listen to me.

954
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:36.185
Do not move,
do not touch anything,


955
00:52:36.259 --> 00:52:38.227
and do not say anything
to anyone.


956
00:52:38.295 --> 00:52:40.126
We will be there
in 15 minutes, okay?


957
00:52:42.365 --> 00:52:44.162
KK, Nikolai...

958
00:52:44.234 --> 00:52:47.169
Russia, one,
USA capitalist pig, zero.


959
00:52:47.237 --> 00:52:48.226
Are you finished?

960
00:52:48.305 --> 00:52:49.294
- Yeah.
- Thank you.


961
00:52:49.372 --> 00:52:53.274
All right, guys, we have got to keep
this thing on the down low, okay?


962
00:52:53.343 --> 00:52:54.833
The guys are just pulling a prank.

963
00:52:54.911 --> 00:52:57.709
Why they didn't let you in on it,
I don't know,


964
00:52:57.781 --> 00:53:01.148
but until we find them,
I want you on my butt like Super Glue.


965
00:53:01.217 --> 00:53:02.707
- You got it?
- Really?


966
00:53:02.786 --> 00:53:05.186
Don't go there.
Just get off the couch.


967
00:53:05.255 --> 00:53:06.381
All right, let's go!

968
00:53:06.456 --> 00:53:08.754
We need radio silence.
Not one word about kidnapping.


969
00:53:08.825 --> 00:53:11.521
The last thing we need is the press
catching wind of what's going on.


970
00:53:11.594 --> 00:53:13.755
Hey, you guys,
here they come, here they come!


971
00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:16.594
Can you confirm reports
about 5 Leo Rise's kidnapping?


972
00:53:16.666 --> 00:53:18.896
We have no comment
at this time, gentlemen.


973
00:53:18.968 --> 00:53:21.436
Rumor is the Real Music Liberation
Front say they have the band.


974
00:53:21.504 --> 00:53:22.562
Have they made any demands?

975
00:53:22.639 --> 00:53:24.903
- I was kidnapped.
- <i>Da</i>, kidnapped.


976
00:53:24.974 --> 00:53:27.408
- How many of them were there?
- Leo Red! Leo Red!


977
00:53:29.179 --> 00:53:32.706
Boys and girls,
we will see you on the 20th!


978
00:53:32.782 --> 00:53:34.215
5 Leo Rise, everybody!

979
00:53:39.789 --> 00:53:42.849
- Hey! What are you rejects doing?
- Nothing.


980
00:53:42.926 --> 00:53:44.860
Where's Devon,
and why isn't this place clean?


981
00:53:44.928 --> 00:53:47.396
Devon went to get
cleaning supplies.


982
00:53:47.464 --> 00:53:52.731
Yeah, we're totally on top of it.
Got everything handled.


983
00:53:52.802 --> 00:53:55.396
Good. I'm going to take a siesta.

984
00:53:55.472 --> 00:53:57.463
- Do you need any help?
- What?


985
00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:00.008
It's what they do
in civilized countries.


986
00:54:02.979 --> 00:54:04.173
Like Italy.

987
00:54:13.056 --> 00:54:14.216
Don't answer that.

988
00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:22.320
They're not answering.

989
00:54:22.399 --> 00:54:25.095
Honey, you didn't make 'em
take an oath to sit by the phone.


990
00:54:25.168 --> 00:54:27.033
Well, it worries me.

991
00:54:27.103 --> 00:54:30.470
What worries me is we're not
any closer to solving this case.


992
00:54:32.142 --> 00:54:36.806
I know it might sound cliché,
but I think the butler did it.


993
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:39.705
I don't know.

994
00:54:39.783 --> 00:54:41.341
Think I'm onto something.

995
00:54:48.291 --> 00:54:49.315
Your gloves.

996
00:54:49.392 --> 00:54:51.019
What about them?

997
00:54:51.094 --> 00:54:53.858
Cloth. The Raven's gloves
are leather.


998
00:54:55.231 --> 00:54:58.223
I'll have to remember that
next time I kidnap a rock star


999
00:54:58.301 --> 00:55:00.360
and dress up like his favorite
comic-book babe.


1000
00:55:02.639 --> 00:55:05.699
You are such a dork. I can't believe
I actually thought you'd be cool.


1001
00:55:05.775 --> 00:55:08.369
- I'm cool.
- And yet you treat your fans like crap.


1002
00:55:08.445 --> 00:55:09.707
It's not like that.

1003
00:55:09.779 --> 00:55:12.680
Really? Then prove it.
Perform for our school.


1004
00:55:12.749 --> 00:55:13.716
No way.

1005
00:55:13.783 --> 00:55:14.442
- Yes.
- No.


1006
00:55:14.617 --> 00:55:15.549
- Yes.
- No!


1007
00:55:15.618 --> 00:55:17.916
- Yes, you have to.
- Look, I can't, okay?


1008
00:55:18.988 --> 00:55:20.012
What do you mean you can't?

1009
00:55:20.089 --> 00:55:21.716
Forget it. Leave it alone.

1010
00:55:21.791 --> 00:55:24.157
I did not go through all this
just to leave it alone.


1011
00:55:24.227 --> 00:55:26.923
You have to tell me.
Why can't you perform?


1012
00:55:28.298 --> 00:55:32.530
Ritchie, listen, whatever it is that
you say doesn't leave this room.


1013
00:55:34.604 --> 00:55:35.593
I can't...

1014
00:55:35.672 --> 00:55:37.333
- Hold that thought. Gabby!
- What are you doing?


1015
00:55:37.407 --> 00:55:39.739
I'm just gonna tell her anyway.

1016
00:55:39.809 --> 00:55:41.834
It's like the unspoken
best friend manifesto.


1017
00:55:45.114 --> 00:55:46.479
Not even the band knows.

1018
00:55:47.484 --> 00:55:50.317
If you can't tell your biggest fans,
then who can you tell?


1019
00:55:50.386 --> 00:55:52.251
She's right, we are
your biggest fans.


1020
00:55:52.322 --> 00:55:53.755
We know everything about you.

1021
00:55:53.823 --> 00:55:56.189
There's nothing you can say
that will make us not like you.


1022
00:55:56.259 --> 00:55:57.988
What could you possibly say
that would...


1023
00:55:58.061 --> 00:55:59.255
I'm a fake!

1024
00:56:00.330 --> 00:56:01.820
I can't sing in public.

1025
00:56:02.699 --> 00:56:03.825
What are you talking about?

1026
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:05.731
You sing in front of
huge crowds every night.


1027
00:56:05.802 --> 00:56:07.099
- Yeah.
- It's a scam.


1028
00:56:09.706 --> 00:56:10.968
What...

1029
00:56:11.808 --> 00:56:14.641
You mean that...
you mean...


1030
00:56:14.711 --> 00:56:15.871
Yeah.

1031
00:56:17.547 --> 00:56:20.015
No, 5 Leo Rise doesn't lip-synch.

1032
00:56:20.683 --> 00:56:23.117
They don't, but I do.

1033
00:56:23.186 --> 00:56:26.280
So as much as I'd like
to help you guys out, I can't.


1034
00:56:27.056 --> 00:56:28.045
I just can't.

1035
00:56:29.292 --> 00:56:30.850
But if we had won the label drive,

1036
00:56:30.927 --> 00:56:33.088
you'd have to perform
for our school anyway.


1037
00:56:33.863 --> 00:56:36.263
We use our own perfectly
choreographed sound and lights,


1038
00:56:36.332 --> 00:56:37.458
which you don't have.

1039
00:56:37.534 --> 00:56:39.434
That stuff is easy to hide behind.

1040
00:56:39.502 --> 00:56:43.029
No, no, no, no, no. Stage fright
is just stress and fear.


1041
00:56:43.106 --> 00:56:46.337
You can conquer it.
I mean, at least that's what they say.


1042
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:49.535
We'll have you singing again
in no time, really.


1043
00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:52.678
Whoa, dude.

1044
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:55.581
You totally just blew my mind.

1045
00:56:55.652 --> 00:56:59.281
It can't be.

1046
00:56:59.355 --> 00:57:00.344
That's our thing.

1047
00:57:00.423 --> 00:57:02.482
Well, it sounds like you dorks
need a new thing.


1048
00:57:02.559 --> 00:57:04.857
- Yeah.
- It's not like I wanted to.


1049
00:57:04.928 --> 00:57:08.227
I mean,
the album just blew up.


1050
00:57:08.298 --> 00:57:10.129
And then the tour.

1051
00:57:10.199 --> 00:57:12.531
That first huge show in Anaheim.

1052
00:57:12.602 --> 00:57:15.332
It was too much. I freaked.

1053
00:57:15.405 --> 00:57:17.805
Hollace promised the lip-synching
would be temporary


1054
00:57:17.874 --> 00:57:20.536
and I'd get a chance
to get some help, fix it.


1055
00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:22.373
Is that why you turned
into such a dick?


1056
00:57:23.513 --> 00:57:24.844
He was scared.

1057
00:57:24.914 --> 00:57:27.178
Ritchie, we're going to get you
through this.


1058
00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:28.239
How?

1059
00:57:30.219 --> 00:57:32.449
- Gabby?
- I have an idea.


1060
00:57:33.122 --> 00:57:35.454
But we're going to need some supplies.

1061
00:57:39.329 --> 00:57:41.422
Okay, where is it,
where is it, where is it?


1062
00:57:41.497 --> 00:57:42.623
Gabby, what are we doing?

1063
00:57:42.699 --> 00:57:44.894
We've got to get to the costume shop.
We've got to go.


1064
00:57:48.838 --> 00:57:50.999
What are you kids doing?
What is this? Take that off!


1065
00:57:51.074 --> 00:57:53.304
Wait! Look at this!
Do you see this?


1066
00:57:53.376 --> 00:57:55.537
- Don't worry about it.
- Lincoln always does this.


1067
00:57:55.612 --> 00:57:58.103
Every time I ask, "Would you stay put
and not do anything..."


1068
00:57:58.181 --> 00:57:59.580
- Oh, my...
- You know...


1069
00:57:59.649 --> 00:58:00.980
Oh, gosh.

1070
00:58:01.050 --> 00:58:03.917
- Excuse you.
- Hey, Kira.


1071
00:58:03.987 --> 00:58:06.751
- Oh, great hair.
- It does look fabulous.


1072
00:58:06.823 --> 00:58:08.120
Yeah, no thanks to you.

1073
00:58:08.191 --> 00:58:09.920
They're extensions, you idiot.

1074
00:58:09.993 --> 00:58:11.517
We do not have time
for this right now.


1075
00:58:11.594 --> 00:58:13.619
- I'm sorry.
- That's weird, Devon.


1076
00:58:13.696 --> 00:58:16.995
I just saw you on Friday,
but you look bigger.


1077
00:58:17.066 --> 00:58:18.192
Did you gain weight?

1078
00:58:18.267 --> 00:58:21.498
No, but your bulimia
makes you see things.


1079
00:58:21.571 --> 00:58:25.837
That is so weird.
Even your voice sounds fatter.


1080
00:58:25.908 --> 00:58:27.899
- That is so weird.
- It does, it sounds way fat.


1081
00:58:27.977 --> 00:58:30.207
After tomorrow,
you are so going to wish


1082
00:58:30.279 --> 00:58:32.406
you could travel back in time
and be nicer to us.


1083
00:58:32.482 --> 00:58:33.949
Move!

1084
00:58:35.818 --> 00:58:39.117
Wow, she believes in time travel.

1085
00:58:39.188 --> 00:58:40.849
Geeks usually do.

1086
00:58:40.923 --> 00:58:42.390
Yeah.

1087
00:58:42.458 --> 00:58:45.552
It's amazing how you
could just stand up to them like that.


1088
00:58:45.628 --> 00:58:48.119
After Danielle,
nothing scares me.


1089
00:58:49.165 --> 00:58:51.224
Welcome
to Mo's Costume Emporium,


1090
00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:54.667
where your wildest
costume fantasies come true.


1091
00:58:54.737 --> 00:58:56.329
Hey, Mo.

1092
00:58:56.406 --> 00:58:57.873
We're looking for costumes.

1093
00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:59.134
I love it.

1094
00:58:59.208 --> 00:59:01.608
You I see as Snow White,
and you...


1095
00:59:01.678 --> 00:59:03.441
well, you're a total Bambi.

1096
00:59:03.513 --> 00:59:05.413
- You cute little thing.
- That's perfect.


1097
00:59:05.481 --> 00:59:08.450
Now all we need is
four guys' costumes ASAP.


1098
00:59:09.218 --> 00:59:10.845
Yeah, hold the phone.

1099
00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:16.085
Sweetness, these costumes
are reserved weeks in advance.


1100
00:59:17.927 --> 00:59:20.122
I can't just make them appear
out of thin air.


1101
00:59:20.196 --> 00:59:22.289
What am I, a magician?

1102
00:59:25.935 --> 00:59:27.664
Mo, listen.

1103
00:59:27.737 --> 00:59:31.138
We're kind of desperate here.
Is there anything for today,


1104
00:59:31.207 --> 00:59:32.333
anything at all?

1105
00:59:32.408 --> 00:59:33.966
I'll see what I can find.

1106
00:59:34.043 --> 00:59:35.806
Okay, guys, keep it fun.

1107
00:59:35.878 --> 00:59:36.902
The goofier we look,

1108
00:59:36.979 --> 00:59:39.447
the more likely we'll be able to get Ritchie
to sing for us.


1109
00:59:39.515 --> 00:59:41.779
Okay, go for it.
Rock it.


1110
00:59:47.323 --> 00:59:50.121
Ritchie, just breathe and believe.

1111
00:59:50.193 --> 00:59:51.956
- Ready?
- Yeah.


1112
00:59:52.028 --> 00:59:53.017
Hope this works.

1113
00:59:53.096 --> 00:59:54.393
Cue the music, Pete.

1121
01:00:16.986 --> 01:00:18.977
- Devon!
- What?


1122
01:00:19.055 --> 01:00:21.523
What are you doing?
I thought I told you to clean the house!


1123
01:00:21.591 --> 01:00:22.717
It's a complete disaster!

1124
01:00:22.792 --> 01:00:24.987
I'm calling Mom and Dad
if you don't clean the house.


1125
01:00:25.061 --> 01:00:26.926
- I'm going to call Mom and Dad!
- What is this?


1126
01:00:26.996 --> 01:00:28.520
I'm rehearsing a play for school.

I'm a hot dog.

1128

You're like a new

Ow.

1130
01:00:38.541 --> 01:00:39.735
Clean the house.

1131
01:00:44.781 --> 01:00:45.805
Okay, continue.

1132
01:00:46.616 --> 01:00:48.311
Come on, man, we can do this.

1133
01:00:48.384 --> 01:00:49.942
All right.
Let's try it again.


1134
01:00:54.857 --> 01:00:56.381

1143
01:01:25.254 --> 01:01:27.245
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.


1144
01:01:27.323 --> 01:01:31.623
I mean, it's obvious
that your friend here is a total fraud.


1145
01:01:31.694 --> 01:01:34.390
He's right, I can't do this.
This isn't working.


1146
01:01:35.631 --> 01:01:37.622

Sorry.

- Lincoln!

1202

I wasn't crushing on him.
He was crushing on me.

Oh, 'cause where I was standing,

1204
01:04:37.146 --> 01:04:39.376
the river of crush
was flowing both ways.


1205
01:04:39.448 --> 01:04:41.746
Look, he was singing,
and I got caught up,

and... I'm sorry.

Well, we have
bigger issues to deal with.


1212

You just think you do.


1219

- No, there was this moment.
- What moment?


1220
01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:30.355
She was just gently washing
the egg off me.


1221
01:05:30.433 --> 01:05:32.492
She, like,
washed the egg off of you,


1222
01:05:32.568 --> 01:05:34.968
or just helped you
with a couple of shells that were like...


1223
01:05:35.037 --> 01:05:38.336
No, she wiped the egg off...
with a big sponge.


1224
01:05:38.407 --> 01:05:41.205
No. See, what you've got

1225
01:05:41.277 --> 01:05:43.507
is that Stockholm Syndrome
I've been reading about.


1226
01:05:43.579 --> 01:05:45.274
- That's it.
- Stockholm Syndrome?


1227
01:05:45.347 --> 01:05:49.943
It's when the hostage... you...
begins to identify with the captor,


1228
01:05:50.019 --> 01:05:52.351
especially if there's any moments
of kindness shown,


1229
01:05:52.421 --> 01:05:55.618
which can be misinterpreted
as special treatment,


1230
01:05:55.691 --> 01:05:58.455
thus leaving you to believe
that you're in some kind of love.


1231
01:05:58.527 --> 01:06:00.222
I don't know about that.

1232
01:06:00.296 --> 01:06:02.594
I just... I just really dig Devon.

1233
01:06:04.266 --> 01:06:06.291
I think you should shut up now
before I kill you.


1234
01:06:06.368 --> 01:06:08.302
I guess I don't mind.

1235
01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:10.804
I mean, technically,
I'd be dying for Devon.


1236
01:06:10.873 --> 01:06:14.900
No, if anybody's going to die
for Devon, it's going to be me.


1237
01:06:14.977 --> 01:06:17.002
- I've earned it!
- Put your hands on the wheel!


1238
01:06:17.079 --> 01:06:18.068
Don't tell me what to do!

1239
01:06:18.147 --> 01:06:21.742
So it was working?
You got Ritchie to sing?


1240
01:06:21.817 --> 01:06:24.513
Yeah. All he needed
was to be himself,


1241
01:06:24.587 --> 01:06:26.953
and by playing the guitar
he felt comfortable enough,


1242
01:06:27.022 --> 01:06:28.751
and it just flowed out.

1243
01:06:28.824 --> 01:06:30.917
Do you have any idea
where he's taking him?


1244
01:06:30.993 --> 01:06:31.982
No idea.

1245
01:06:32.061 --> 01:06:34.427
When he gets upset,
he tends to disappear,


1246
01:06:34.497 --> 01:06:35.794
sometimes for days at a time.

1247
01:06:35.865 --> 01:06:38.060
That kiss thing
put him over the edge.


1248
01:06:38.134 --> 01:06:40.500
He had that crazy Lincoln look
in his eyes.


1249
01:06:40.569 --> 01:06:43.402
- What an idiot!
- You just had to do it, didn't you?


1250
01:06:43.472 --> 01:06:46.032
Never mind that we're trying
to save our social lives


1251
01:06:46.108 --> 01:06:48.099
from an accident you caused.

1252
01:06:48.177 --> 01:06:50.372
Never mind that we had
this plan to help Ritchie,


1253
01:06:50.446 --> 01:06:52.641
a plan that was starting to work.

1254
01:06:52.715 --> 01:06:55.809
No, you just had to kiss him
and ruin everything.


1255
01:06:56.919 --> 01:06:59.479
Gabs, you're kind of losing it.

1256
01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:05.749
Gabs?

1257
01:07:06.729 --> 01:07:07.991
Don't call me that.

1258
01:07:09.632 --> 01:07:10.758
What are you doing?

1259
01:07:10.833 --> 01:07:12.061
I'm getting my stuff.

1260
01:07:12.134 --> 01:07:14.568
What? You never get your stuff.
Your stuff lives here.


1261
01:07:14.637 --> 01:07:16.070
It's been here since fourth grade.

1262
01:07:16.138 --> 01:07:19.801
Well, my stuff's leaving,
and it's taking me with it.


1263
01:07:23.679 --> 01:07:25.613
Gabby, you're just emotional.

1264
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:29.879
"Stand up for yourself, Gabby.

1265
01:07:29.952 --> 01:07:32.477
Don't let Kira
push you around, Gabby."


1266
01:07:34.456 --> 01:07:37.892
The main person pushing me
around, Devon, is you.


1267
01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.086
What?

1268
01:07:39.161 --> 01:07:41.686
I didn't want to skip school
and meet 5 Leo Rise


1269
01:07:41.764 --> 01:07:45.200
or do this stupid kidnapping thing
at all, but you pushed.


1270
01:07:45.267 --> 01:07:48.259
- You could've said no.
- I did!


1271
01:07:48.337 --> 01:07:49.827
- You did?
- Yeah.


1272
01:07:49.905 --> 01:07:50.894
I guess I didn't hear you.

1273
01:07:50.973 --> 01:07:53.271
Because you never listen, Devon.

1274
01:07:53.976 --> 01:07:57.912
This whole thing has ruined
the one good thing in my life.


1275
01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:01.347
5 Leo Rise used to be
my little slice of happiness,


1276
01:08:01.417 --> 01:08:04.784
but now 5 Leo Rise
is just crap too.


1277
01:08:05.754 --> 01:08:06.482
No offense.

1278
01:08:07.923 --> 01:08:09.481
- Gabs...
- Don't!


1279
01:08:09.558 --> 01:08:13.187
Don't. I know you must think
I'm just some pushover dork,


1280
01:08:13.262 --> 01:08:16.754
but I want you to know, Devon,
that I do have a spine.


1281
01:08:16.832 --> 01:08:18.459
Starting right now,

1282
01:08:18.534 --> 01:08:21.731
Devon Lisette Thompson
and Gabby Ann Davis


1283
01:08:21.804 --> 01:08:23.328
are no longer best friends.

1284
01:08:24.073 --> 01:08:28.066
Even if I am a total loner
for the rest of my life.


1285
01:08:29.411 --> 01:08:30.400
And one more thing...

1286
01:08:41.023 --> 01:08:42.081
Whoa.

1287
01:08:43.926 --> 01:08:45.393
There. We're even.

1288
01:08:49.598 --> 01:08:50.963
Hi, Dad.

1289
01:08:51.033 --> 01:08:53.433
Mom got bludgeoned in the pantry?
That sucks.


1290
01:08:53.502 --> 01:08:54.491
Oh, me?

1291
01:08:54.570 --> 01:08:57.061
Remember what I said about
not having any boys in the house?


1292
01:08:57.139 --> 01:09:00.233
Yeah, I was just wondering,
does it matter if they're famous?


1293
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:02.072
Don't you dare.
Hang up the phone!


1294
01:09:02.144 --> 01:09:04.044
I have a secret to tell.

1295
01:09:05.381 --> 01:09:06.973
Can I talk to her?
Let me talk to her.


1296
01:09:07.049 --> 01:09:08.346
They hung up on me.

1297
01:09:08.417 --> 01:09:09.714
They hung up on you?

1298
01:09:09.785 --> 01:09:10.877
Devon! Get your...

1299
01:09:12.388 --> 01:09:15.221
Thank you very much, Danielle!
You just ruined my life forever!


1300
01:09:15.291 --> 01:09:16.280
Grow up!

1301
01:09:21.664 --> 01:09:23.131
You dirty dog!

1302
01:09:24.066 --> 01:09:25.761
Wait, you speak Italian?

1303
01:09:25.834 --> 01:09:28.359
Yes, my last name is Margiatta.

1304
01:09:31.006 --> 01:09:32.439
I can't get through.

1305
01:09:32.508 --> 01:09:35.375
That's it.
We are leaving right now.


1306
01:09:35.444 --> 01:09:37.503
Hey! Where do you think
you're going?


1307
01:09:37.579 --> 01:09:38.705
Unlike you, I'm leaving.

1308
01:09:38.781 --> 01:09:41.249
I'm not just going to sit around
while you get your voice back


1309
01:09:41.317 --> 01:09:43.785
and win Devon's heart
in the process. I'm out.


1310
01:09:43.852 --> 01:09:45.251
You can't just leave me here.

1311
01:09:45.321 --> 01:09:46.652
I can't?

1312
01:09:46.722 --> 01:09:47.780
Watch me.

1313
01:09:50.759 --> 01:09:53.353
Yo, yo, Lincoln, dude.
Dude, come on.


1314
01:09:54.697 --> 01:09:56.756
Don't drive away!
Get back here!


1315
01:09:58.167 --> 01:09:59.225
Lincoln!

1316
01:10:05.107 --> 01:10:06.131
Yeah.

1317
01:10:10.679 --> 01:10:11.703
Whoa.

1318
01:10:22.524 --> 01:10:23.684
You think she's okay?

1319
01:10:26.195 --> 01:10:28.823
Devon. Devon, you all right?

1320
01:10:28.897 --> 01:10:29.886
Yeah, I'm fine.

1321
01:10:36.071 --> 01:10:39.837
It's just that... Gabby's right.
I've ruined her life.


1322
01:10:39.908 --> 01:10:43.435
And this whole thing
is one big disaster, and so am I.


1323
01:10:44.413 --> 01:10:47.007
And I just don't know what I'm
going to do without her, okay?


1324
01:10:50.185 --> 01:10:51.447
Do you think I'm pushy?

1325
01:10:54.223 --> 01:10:56.623
Yeah, a little bit.

1326
01:10:56.692 --> 01:10:59.160
But not like my sister, right?
She's the pushy one.


1327
01:10:59.228 --> 01:11:01.560
Maybe that's what it feels like
to Gabby.


1328
01:11:02.464 --> 01:11:03.829
But I'm nice, right?

1329
01:11:03.899 --> 01:11:05.161
Yeah.

1330
01:11:05.234 --> 01:11:07.566
Gabby's got
her own way with things.


1331
01:11:07.636 --> 01:11:09.866
Yeah, and you've got
to respect her for that.


1332
01:11:13.242 --> 01:11:15.107
Oh, my God, I'm going to kill him.

1333
01:11:17.312 --> 01:11:20.076
Don't even set foot in this house
if you don't have Ritchie with you.


1334
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:21.446
- Ow, Devon...
- I mean it!


1335
01:11:21.517 --> 01:11:23.678
- Well, can I explain?
- I don't want an explanation.


1336
01:11:23.752 --> 01:11:25.117
I want Ritchie.

1337
01:11:26.522 --> 01:11:29.013
It's a little complicated.

1338
01:11:29.091 --> 01:11:32.185
He started saying
all these terrible things about you,


1339
01:11:32.261 --> 01:11:33.660
and my emotions just went crazy.

1340
01:11:33.729 --> 01:11:35.094
- Terrible things?
- Sort of.


1341
01:11:35.164 --> 01:11:38.099
He was telling me about how you
were helping him with his stage fright,


1342
01:11:38.167 --> 01:11:39.691
and he said something
about some egg,


1343
01:11:39.768 --> 01:11:42.066
and then he was telling me
about how cool you are,


1344
01:11:42.137 --> 01:11:44.435
like I need him telling me
about how cool you are.


1345
01:11:44.506 --> 01:11:45.632
I mean, I'm not only a member,

1346
01:11:45.707 --> 01:11:47.834
but I'm the president
of the Devon fan club.


1347
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:50.538
Wait, he said I was helping him
with his stage fright.


1348
01:11:50.612 --> 01:11:52.204
Something like that.

1349
01:11:52.281 --> 01:11:54.010
It worked.

1350
01:11:57.786 --> 01:12:00.152
Lincoln, I should
so kick your ass right now,


1351
01:12:00.222 --> 01:12:01.416
but I need your help.

1352
01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:04.516
I need you to get in your jeep
and go get Ritchie.


1353
01:12:04.593 --> 01:12:05.821
It's dark out here, though.

1354
01:12:05.894 --> 01:12:07.327
I don't care.

1355
01:12:07.396 --> 01:12:09.557
And it's cold too.
When I breathe, I can see my breath.


1356
01:12:09.631 --> 01:12:12.361
I don't want to see or hear from you
until you have Ritchie with you.


1357
01:12:12.434 --> 01:12:14.163
- Understood?
- But just... can I...?


1358
01:12:17.005 --> 01:12:19.701
You guys need to call Pete
and tell him what equipment you need.


1359
01:12:19.775 --> 01:12:21.868
5 Leo Rise is going to perform
at our school.


1360
01:12:22.678 --> 01:12:24.009
Get going.

1361
01:12:24.079 --> 01:12:25.273
All right.

1362
01:12:29.418 --> 01:12:33.320
Mr. Scooter,
it is a pleasure to meet you.


1363
01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:37.954
Kidnap a boy band.
See what she got me into, man?


1364
01:12:39.595 --> 01:12:40.584
Girls.

1365
01:12:41.864 --> 01:12:44.025
Come on, pick up,
pick up, pick up.


1366
01:12:44.099 --> 01:12:46.090
She's just going to keep calling
till I pick up.


1367
01:12:46.168 --> 01:12:48.466
You know I'm just
going to call again. Pick up.


1368
01:12:50.038 --> 01:12:51.027
- Hello?
- Hello?


1369
01:12:51.106 --> 01:12:53.631
- What?
- I know I'm in best friend Siberia...


1370
01:12:53.709 --> 01:12:57.076
<i>... but I wanted to let you know to wear</i>
<i>something really cute to school...</i>


1371
01:12:58.180 --> 01:12:59.408
Hello?

1372
01:13:14.162 --> 01:13:16.255
Guys? Wake up.

1373
01:13:16.331 --> 01:13:17.696
Scooter.

1374
01:13:17.766 --> 01:13:19.757
Come on, Scooter, wake up.
We've got to go.


1375
01:13:19.835 --> 01:13:22.633
Morning.
Mason, wake up.


1376
01:13:22.704 --> 01:13:23.728
- Mason, wake up!
- What?


1377
01:13:23.805 --> 01:13:25.397
We've got to go.
It's showtime.


1378
01:13:25.474 --> 01:13:27.499
I normally sleep till noon.

1379
01:13:27.576 --> 01:13:28.634
Come on.

1380
01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:31.110
Got to go. Mason, got to go.
Got to rock. Come on.


1381
01:13:31.179 --> 01:13:32.669
Got to go.
Rock 'n' roll, Mason.


1382
01:13:32.748 --> 01:13:34.113
All right.

1383
01:13:55.771 --> 01:13:58.399
I just... I still don't understand
what the screaming was about.


1384
01:13:58.473 --> 01:14:01.670
They were screaming, like...
"Devon, give me the phone and..."


1385
01:14:01.743 --> 01:14:02.732
They hung up the phone...

1386
01:14:02.811 --> 01:14:04.642
I don't know what the...
they hung up the phone.


1387
01:14:04.713 --> 01:14:08.012
The assembly starts in ten minutes,
so we've got to book.


1388
01:14:08.083 --> 01:14:09.516
- There's Devon.
- "You can trust them."


1389
01:14:14.389 --> 01:14:15.686
Hurry, hurry.

1390
01:14:15.757 --> 01:14:17.884
Devon Lisette,
if you want to live to see 17,


1391
01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.791
get out of that car right now.

1392
01:14:19.895 --> 01:14:22.420
- You took an oath, young lady.
- I can't explain right now...


1393
01:14:22.497 --> 01:14:24.658
...but there are things
more important than the oath.


1394
01:14:24.733 --> 01:14:27.327
No. Dad, it's not her fault.
I told her it was okay.


1395
01:14:27.402 --> 01:14:29.267
No, there's nothing okay about this.

1396
01:14:29.338 --> 01:14:30.635
Go, go.

1397
01:14:32.908 --> 01:14:35.570
Get out of this car right now!
Turn it off!


1398
01:14:35.644 --> 01:14:37.942
Who are those boys...
are those boys laughing at me?


1399
01:14:38.013 --> 01:14:40.379
Hey! Where you going?
Wait!


1400
01:14:50.659 --> 01:14:52.991
Watch where you're going,
firestarter.


1401
01:14:53.061 --> 01:14:56.258
Sorry, Kira. It's...
I just... I...


1402
01:14:56.331 --> 01:14:59.459
I, I, I, I... what, Gabby?

1403
01:15:00.268 --> 01:15:03.760
Breathe, believe.
Breathe, believe.


1404
01:15:03.939 --> 01:15:05.270
Breathe, believe.

1405
01:15:06.308 --> 01:15:09.106
Oh, my God.
What is she doing?


1406
01:15:10.178 --> 01:15:14.308
Look out, everyone, she's about
to explode with geekiness.


1407
01:15:14.383 --> 01:15:15.509
Please don't get any on me.

1408
01:15:15.584 --> 01:15:17.745
Breathe, believe.

1409
01:15:19.688 --> 01:15:21.588
What?

1410
01:15:21.657 --> 01:15:23.682
What are you smiling at?

1411
01:15:23.759 --> 01:15:25.158
Yeah, what's so funny?

1412
01:15:27.562 --> 01:15:29.962
I guess it's more sad than funny.

1413
01:15:30.032 --> 01:15:31.090
What?

1414
01:15:31.166 --> 01:15:36.126
I'm just curious, Kira.
Why are you so cruel to people?


1415
01:15:38.407 --> 01:15:39.499
What?

1416
01:15:40.676 --> 01:15:42.109
I'm not cruel.

1417
01:15:43.311 --> 01:15:46.542
'Cause I know someone
who was mean to everyone


1418
01:15:46.615 --> 01:15:47.843
just so they wouldn't find out

1419
01:15:47.916 --> 01:15:50.851
that he might not be as cool
as he pretended to be.


1420
01:15:51.887 --> 01:15:55.914
Well, yeah, but... I am cool.

1421
01:15:57.292 --> 01:15:59.954
Yeah. No... yeah,
you're cool, way cool.


1422
01:16:00.028 --> 01:16:05.489
'Cause if you were cool,
you could afford to be nice.


1423
01:16:06.668 --> 01:16:07.965
See you at the assembly.

1424
01:16:12.007 --> 01:16:16.137
Guys, I'm really nice.

1425
01:16:16.812 --> 01:16:20.270
Guys... I am so nice.

1426
01:16:20.348 --> 01:16:22.009
Okay, guys, the sound check's done.

1427
01:16:22.084 --> 01:16:24.712
The drum kit and keys are on stage.
All you got to do is plug in.


1428
01:16:30.559 --> 01:16:32.322
Well, isn't this cute.

1429
01:16:33.495 --> 01:16:34.621
This isn't good.

1430
01:16:34.696 --> 01:16:36.163
What the hell were you thinking?

1431
01:16:36.231 --> 01:16:38.324
Would you tell him?
We were kidnapped.


1432
01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:42.336
KK, man, I think you've got
an overactive imagination, dude.


1433
01:16:42.404 --> 01:16:43.837
Whoa. What's with the instruments?

1434
01:16:43.905 --> 01:16:46.203
We don't actually think
we're going to play these, do we?


1435
01:16:46.274 --> 01:16:48.674
<i>- Instrumenski?</i>
<i>- Da,</i> man. <i>Da.</i>


1436
01:16:48.744 --> 01:16:50.473
Wait, where's Ritchie?

1437
01:16:50.545 --> 01:16:52.979
Why, you got to prep him
for his solo tour?


1438
01:16:53.048 --> 01:16:54.606
I don't know
what you're talking about.


1439
01:16:54.683 --> 01:16:55.445
Where is he?

1440
01:16:55.517 --> 01:16:59.647
Hey, guys! Are you ready
to rock this school?


1441
01:17:00.589 --> 01:17:02.079
Whoa, Ritchie.
Come on, man.


1442
01:17:02.157 --> 01:17:03.988
We do not want to mess
with the people


1443
01:17:04.059 --> 01:17:05.526
at the Aéropostale campaign.

1444
01:17:05.594 --> 01:17:07.494
We're talking
Times Square billboards.


1445
01:17:07.562 --> 01:17:09.393
Hollace, save it, all right?

1446
01:17:09.464 --> 01:17:12.331
We're going to go in there
and play a show with instruments.


1447
01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.129
If you follow, you're fired.

1448
01:17:16.204 --> 01:17:18.263
See? I told you I'd come through.

1449
01:17:19.307 --> 01:17:20.831
I know you did.

1450
01:17:20.909 --> 01:17:22.467
Okay, we've got to go,
got to go.


1451
01:17:23.478 --> 01:17:25.503
No love?
Seriously? Why?


1452
01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:27.445
Thank God you made it.

1453
01:17:27.516 --> 01:17:29.143
Couldn't let my best fans down.

1454
01:17:33.655 --> 01:17:34.917
That's her!

1455
01:17:37.526 --> 01:17:39.687
Way to go, Gabby!

1456
01:17:56.344 --> 01:17:58.244
Kira, don't even worry.

1457
01:17:58.313 --> 01:18:01.248
You're not only cool,
you're a varsity cheerleader.


1458
01:18:01.316 --> 01:18:02.374
Yeah, and?

1459
01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:05.578
Student council president.
Who is Gabby Davis?


1460
01:18:05.654 --> 01:18:07.622
- Nobody.
- Who are you?


1461
01:18:07.689 --> 01:18:09.384
- Somebody.
- Right.


1462
01:18:11.459 --> 01:18:13.324
- What is all this crap?
- I don't know.


1463
01:18:13.395 --> 01:18:15.920
I don't like things
on my stage with me.


1464
01:18:15.997 --> 01:18:17.965
<i>What's up, Highland High?</i>

1465
01:18:18.033 --> 01:18:20.558
<i>Welcome</i>
<i>to your Monday assembly.</i>


1466
01:18:20.635 --> 01:18:26.039
<i>Today we have the important issue</i>
<i>to discuss of interior decorating.</i>


1467
01:18:26.107 --> 01:18:29.372
<i>You know that Jackie O,</i>
<i>she was, like...</i>


1468
01:18:29.444 --> 01:18:32.140
<i>I mean, she died, but she was alive,</i>
<i>like, a while ago,</i>


1469
01:18:32.214 --> 01:18:36.344
<i>and she was married</i>
<i>to some president or something.</i>


1470
01:18:36.418 --> 01:18:39.546
<i>But anyway,</i>
<i>she had great big black...</i>


1471
01:18:39.621 --> 01:18:40.952
It's 5 Leo Rise!

1472
01:18:44.359 --> 01:18:45.587
Who are those people?

1473
01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:47.890
Hey, you guys know
where Gabby Davis is?


1474
01:18:47.963 --> 01:18:49.794
- Gabby.
- KK!


1475
01:18:50.498 --> 01:18:51.965
Hi, Scooter!

1476
01:18:52.033 --> 01:18:53.625
Nikolai, over here!

1477
01:18:56.838 --> 01:18:59.238
<i>Jackie O redec...</i>

1478
01:18:59.307 --> 01:19:02.037
<i>Latecomers</i>
<i>are not usually welcome here.</i>


1479
01:19:03.478 --> 01:19:06.675
Breathe and believe, Ritchie.
Breathe and believe.


1480
01:19:10.819 --> 01:19:11.808
Yes!

1481
01:19:13.521 --> 01:19:15.716
<i>Yo, what up, 
Highland High School?</i>

1482
01:19:20.829 --> 01:19:23.127
<i>Word is y'all lost a little concert.</i>

1483
01:19:23.198 --> 01:19:26.292
<i>But our girl Gabby Davis</i>
<i>didn't want to leave y'all hanging.</i>


1484
01:19:26.368 --> 01:19:29.531
<i>She hooked this all up for you guys.</i>

1485
01:19:29.604 --> 01:19:30.832
<i>Gabby, get up here.</i>

1486
01:19:40.181 --> 01:19:41.705
<i>Hi, everyone.</i>

1487
01:19:41.783 --> 01:19:44.718
<i>I just wanted to say</i>
<i>that I'm really, really sorry</i>


1488
01:19:44.786 --> 01:19:47.482
<i>for the whole shift label</i>
<i>fiasco thing.</i>


1489
01:19:47.555 --> 01:19:49.989
<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>I couldn't have done it</i>


1490
01:19:50.058 --> 01:19:52.026
<i>without my best friend,</i>
<i>Devon Thompson.</i>


1491
01:19:54.529 --> 01:19:57.054
Gabby! Gabby! Gabby!

1492
01:19:57.132 --> 01:19:59.726
<i>No, okay? Okay, no!</i>

1493
01:19:59.801 --> 01:20:01.200
<i>This is not okay.</i>

1494
01:20:01.269 --> 01:20:05.228
<i>This is not a student council-</i>
<i>approved assembly.</i>


1495
01:20:05.307 --> 01:20:08.708
<i>5 Leo Rise or not...</i>

1496
01:20:08.777 --> 01:20:11.712
- Put down the mike!
<i>...Gabby Davis is still a huge dork.</i>


1497
01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:14.248
Boo!

1498
01:20:14.316 --> 01:20:18.685
<i>I mean, guys...</i>
<i>Iook at what she's wearing.</i>


1499
01:20:20.622 --> 01:20:23.216
<i>That's enough drama</i>
<i>for one day.</i>


1500
01:20:24.225 --> 01:20:26.056
<i>You guys ready to rock?</i>

1501
01:20:27.595 --> 01:20:28.584
<i>Pete, curtain.</i>

1502
01:20:41.209 --> 01:20:44.110
I'm so sorry I doubted you.
I'm, like, the worst best friend ever.


1503
01:20:44.179 --> 01:20:46.170
No, I am. I shouldn't have
bossed you around.


1504
01:20:46.247 --> 01:20:47.874
You deserve respect,

1505
01:20:47.949 --> 01:20:49.712
and I know you do things
your own way.


1506
01:20:49.784 --> 01:20:52.184
And I did.
I stood up to Kira.


1507
01:20:52.253 --> 01:20:54.448
Wow, I'm so pissed off
I missed that.


1508
01:20:56.124 --> 01:20:58.490
<i>Hey, girl, what's your name?</i>

1509
01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:00.926
<i>I think I caught you looking my way</i>

1510
01:21:00.996 --> 01:21:02.486
<i>Do you want to know</i>

1511
01:21:02.564 --> 01:21:05.556
<i>How to get me all to your own?</i>

1512
01:21:05.633 --> 01:21:07.260
<i>Weekends work the best</i>

1513
01:21:07.335 --> 01:21:09.599
<i>I'll pick the place,</i>
<i>you do the rest</i>


1514
01:21:09.671 --> 01:21:11.229
<i>Hey, now, don't be shy</i>

1515
01:21:11.306 --> 01:21:14.173
<i>But you've got to keep me in line</i>

1516
01:21:14.242 --> 01:21:15.732
<i>Love at first sight</i>

1517
01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:18.779
<i>Never thought</i>
<i>it could happen to me</i>


1518
01:21:18.847 --> 01:21:21.247
<i>But you made me believe</i>

1519
01:21:21.316 --> 01:21:23.443
<i>Kidnap my heart</i>

1520
01:21:23.518 --> 01:21:25.748
<i>Take me with you</i>

1521
01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:27.287
<i>Kidnap my heart</i>

1522
01:21:27.355 --> 01:21:29.721
<i>Make my dreams come true</i>

1523
01:21:29.791 --> 01:21:31.782
<i>Send me away</i>

1524
01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:36.160
<i>'Cause falling in love ain't very far</i>

1525
01:21:36.231 --> 01:21:38.324
<i>Not far from the start</i>

1526
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.425
<i>Kidnap my heart</i>

1527
01:21:48.476 --> 01:21:50.740
<i>Can you get me up?</i>

1528
01:21:50.812 --> 01:21:52.473
<i>More fun I could ever dream of</i>

1529
01:21:52.547 --> 01:21:55.482
My God, it's Nikolai.
It's Nikolai, oh my God.


1530
01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:57.142
Stop it.
Shut up.


1531
01:21:58.186 --> 01:22:01.019
- You know what, Kira?
- What?


1532
01:22:01.089 --> 01:22:02.249
Gabby was right.

1533
01:22:02.323 --> 01:22:04.154
You're not as cool
as you think you are.


1534
01:22:04.225 --> 01:22:06.284

Devon put all this together?

1543
01:22:22.777 --> 01:22:26.076
Yeah, I... I kind of helped her.

1544
01:22:26.147 --> 01:22:28.138
<i>Ain't very far</i>

1545
01:22:28.216 --> 01:22:30.446

1560
01:23:14.429 --> 01:23:17.023
There's a rumor going around
that you kidnapped these wussies.


1561
01:23:17.098 --> 01:23:20.363
I can't confirm or deny
any of those allegations,


1562
01:23:20.435 --> 01:23:24.098
but check out the RMLF website.
You'll get all the info you need.


1563
01:23:24.172 --> 01:23:25.161
You are a legend, man.

1564
01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:28.038
Man, I know I'm a legend.
You don't have to tell me.


1565

<i>Kidnap my heart</i>

1566
01:23:30.211 --> 01:23:33.009
Oh, my gosh.
I am your number-one fan.


1567
01:23:33.081 --> 01:23:36.107
Oh, yeah?
I mean, why wouldn't you be?


1568
01:23:38.019 --> 01:23:40.510
Success. No fingerprints.

1569
01:23:40.588 --> 01:23:44.115
<i>... my heart</i>

1570
01:23:57.071 --> 01:23:59.562
Yeah, baby, you know,
the kidnapping was easy.


1571
01:23:59.641 --> 01:24:01.370
A brother like me never gets caught.

1572
01:24:06.648 --> 01:24:07.774
It's time to go.

1573
01:24:19.527 --> 01:24:20.516
- Devon Thompson.
- Yes?


1574
01:24:20.595 --> 01:24:23.826
You're under arrest for kidnapping.
You have the right to remain silent.


1575
01:24:23.898 --> 01:24:26.594
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.


1576
01:24:26.668 --> 01:24:27.999
Get your hands off my daughter.

1577
01:24:28.069 --> 01:24:30.503
- There was no kidnapping.
- Son, we've got sworn statements...


1578
01:24:30.572 --> 01:24:33.063
...from KK McDermott
and Nikolai Mikolov.


1579
01:24:33.141 --> 01:24:35.575
Well, then I'm under arrest too.

1580
01:24:35.643 --> 01:24:37.577
Look, with all due respect,

1581
01:24:37.645 --> 01:24:39.545
Nikolai doesn't even know
what he's saying.


1582
01:24:39.614 --> 01:24:41.809
We met Devon and Gabby
a couple days ago at a signing.


1583
01:24:41.883 --> 01:24:43.350
They're basically our biggest fans.

1584
01:24:43.418 --> 01:24:45.477
They convinced us to play
from the heart,


1585
01:24:45.553 --> 01:24:47.350
so we decided to put on a show
for the school.


1586
01:24:47.422 --> 01:24:49.322
Here we are.
I mean, there was no kidnapping.


1587
01:24:50.925 --> 01:24:53.086
I don't know how many times
I've got to say this, guys.


1588
01:24:53.161 --> 01:24:55.356
There was no kidnapping.

1589
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:56.761
You're big.

1590
01:24:56.831 --> 01:24:59.698
So everybody's fine.
And we're great.


1591
01:25:00.702 --> 01:25:01.999
Leo huddle, guys.
Come on.


1592
01:25:04.005 --> 01:25:06.098
Guys, that rocked.

1593
01:25:06.174 --> 01:25:08.301
Let's get in the studio
and lay that down, come on.


1594
01:25:12.347 --> 01:25:13.371
Thanks.

1595
01:25:16.451 --> 01:25:17.440
Cut 'em loose.

1596
01:25:24.759 --> 01:25:27.523
Dad, we'll call you from the road.

1597
01:25:51.753 --> 01:25:53.687
- Gabs?
- Yeah?


1598
01:25:53.755 --> 01:25:55.916
Would you really
have gone to jail for me?


1599
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.979
Yeah.

1600
01:25:57.058 --> 01:26:00.152
You're, like, the best
best friend ever.


1601
01:26:00.228 --> 01:26:01.388
I know.

1602
01:26:04.132 --> 01:26:05.429
What do we do now?

1603
01:26:06.834 --> 01:26:09.029
Well, I heard about
this hot new band.
