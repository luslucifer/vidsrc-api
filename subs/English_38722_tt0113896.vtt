1
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.120
Whenever I see the bridges
that connect


2
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.370
Los Angeles with
East Los Angeles,


3
00:01:31.338 --> 00:01:33.328
I remember my family.

4
00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:36.993
I remember my father
and my mother.


5
00:01:37.962 --> 00:01:38.791
My brothers,

6
00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:41.615
Chucho, little Jimmy,
and Memo the lawyer.


7
00:01:43.044 --> 00:01:46.410
My crazy sisters,
Toni and Irene.


8
00:01:52.085 --> 00:01:53.246
Ice cream!

9
00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:29.033
But to write the story
of my family,


10
00:02:29.663 --> 00:02:33.360
I have to begin where millions
of stories have begun,


11
00:02:34.246 --> 00:02:38.949
in a small village in Mexico
a long, long time ago.


12
00:03:48.736 --> 00:03:52.397
Two-timing dog!
I'll kill you!


13
00:03:54.027 --> 00:03:57.688
You won't escape from me alive!

14
00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.314
I'll kill you!

15
00:04:04.525 --> 00:04:05.804
You bastard!

16
00:04:06.317 --> 00:04:09.149
You unfaithful dog!

17
00:04:15.024 --> 00:04:17.773
No, Trini, no!
Don't shoot my brother!


18
00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.855
Trini, no!
Please!


19
00:04:20.482 --> 00:04:21.560
Oh, God. Roberto...

20
00:04:21.981 --> 00:04:23.640
You miserable dog!

21
00:04:24.148 --> 00:04:26.470
I didn't do anything!
I swear!


22
00:04:26.772 --> 00:04:27.602
Adulterer!

23
00:04:31.355 --> 00:04:32.303
Son of a...!

24
00:04:34.105 --> 00:04:36.853
Actually, nothing like that
ever really happened.


25
00:04:37.063 --> 00:04:40.013
That's just the way my father
used to tell the story.


26
00:04:40.604 --> 00:04:44.265
His brother Roberto really died
of a ruptured appendix.


27
00:04:45.812 --> 00:04:48.264
In those days, just after the
revolution, times were hard


28
00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:51.767
and my dad's in-laws couldn't
afford to feed an extra mouth.


29
00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:53.891
So my father had to leave.

30
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.761
Now the only living relative
my father knew about


31
00:04:57.977 --> 00:05:02.550
lived in a village called Nuestra
Señora Reina de Los Angeles.


32
00:05:03.018 --> 00:05:05.719
And he figured he could walk
there in a day or two.


33
00:05:06.475 --> 00:05:09.592
Are you talking about Los Angeles,
Jalisco?


34
00:05:10.475 --> 00:05:13.093
Or do you mean Los Angeles,
Colima?


35
00:05:13.475 --> 00:05:17.930
I mean Los Angeles
in California.


36
00:05:19.432 --> 00:05:23.756
That's really far.
It's not even here in Mexico.


37
00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:25.259
That's another country.

38
00:05:26.264 --> 00:05:27.638
Another country?

39
00:05:28.556 --> 00:05:30.842
What does that mean,
another country?


40
00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.551
Another country is...
another country!


41
00:05:34.972 --> 00:05:36.927
It's on the other side
of the world.


42
00:05:37.138 --> 00:05:38.844
The other side of the world.

43
00:05:39.096 --> 00:05:41.252
My father thought about it.

44
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:45.677
Good God, he thought, it might
take 2 weeks to walk there.


45
00:05:46.887 --> 00:05:48.877
We can take you part
of the way.


46
00:05:49.636 --> 00:05:50.714
Thank you.

47
00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:53.174
Go on, get in back.
Watch yourself.


48
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.800
It took him over a year to reach
the "other side of the world".


49
00:06:08.342 --> 00:06:09.751
He walked most of the way.

50
00:06:09.967 --> 00:06:13.414
And we kids, well, we heard
of that journey many times.


51
00:06:13.966 --> 00:06:16.999
He was attacked by ten bandits
in Sonora...


52
00:06:17.258 --> 00:06:19.580
and had to beat them off
with a cactus branch.


53
00:06:20.299 --> 00:06:23.498
He rode the back of
a snorting mountain lion.


54
00:06:26.215 --> 00:06:28.252
But finally, he reached

55
00:06:28.548 --> 00:06:31.794
El Pueblo Nuestra Señora Reina
de Los Angeles.


56
00:06:33.714 --> 00:06:34.708
The one in California.

57
00:06:37.088 --> 00:06:41.579
The border? Well, in those days
it was just a line in the dirt.


58
00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:22.952
Excuse me.

59
00:07:23.665 --> 00:07:26.236
My name is Jose Sanchez.

60
00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:35.110
Hands up, you bastard,
or I'll shoot your balls off!


61
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.363
How dare you come in here
to rob me!


62
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.326
But no, I'm not...

63
00:07:38.538 --> 00:07:41.027
Shut up if you want
to stay alive.


64
00:07:41.246 --> 00:07:43.569
Put your hands on your head.
Slowly!


65
00:07:43.913 --> 00:07:46.235
And get down on the floor!

66
00:07:46.454 --> 00:07:48.528
- But I'm the son of...
- Son of your mother!


67
00:07:48.787 --> 00:07:50.742
Hit the floor and shut up!

68
00:07:52.453 --> 00:07:54.243
I'm the son of Pedro Sanchez who
was the cousin of Joaquin Vargas...


69
00:07:54.453 --> 00:07:55.614
who was the nephew
of Francisco Vargas!


70
00:08:00.619 --> 00:08:05.322
But you're family!
Why didn't you say so before?


71
00:08:08.868 --> 00:08:10.360
Well, I tried, but...

72
00:08:10.742 --> 00:08:12.484
And how is Francisco?

73
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.397
I used to herd cattle with him
in the San Fernando Valley.


74
00:08:17.033 --> 00:08:19.901
- Well, I never met him.
- And Joaquin? Little Joaquin?


75
00:08:21.158 --> 00:08:23.859
Well, I never really knew him,
either. Personally, I mean.


76
00:08:25.032 --> 00:08:27.781
How good it is to have
some family here.


77
00:08:27.282 --> 00:08:30.030
It's almost like
you're my own grandson!


78
00:08:30.573 --> 00:08:33.405
You must be tired and hungry...

79
00:08:33.989 --> 00:08:36.856
They called the old man
" El Californio"


80
00:08:37.114 --> 00:08:39.602
because he didn't come
from anywhere else.


81
00:08:39.822 --> 00:08:44.229
He was born here, in Los Angeles,
when it was still Mexico.


82
00:08:42.821 --> 00:08:45.060
My father had found
a new home.


83
00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.649
Even then there
were bridges.


84
00:08:51.945 --> 00:08:53.816
My father soon joined
the people crossing


85
00:08:54.028 --> 00:08:57.109
from their barrio on the east
river to do the work of the city


86
00:08:57.361 --> 00:08:58.853
on the other side.

87
00:08:59.319 --> 00:09:02.850
They mowed the lawns, took care
of the children, cleaned house,


88
00:09:03.193 --> 00:09:04.686
worked in restaurant
kitchens.


89
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:09.766
But no one from the west river
ever crossed into the barrio.


90
00:09:13.775 --> 00:09:15.102
Make sure that they're
all cleaned up


91
00:09:15.358 --> 00:09:17.064
to go to Grandma's tonight.

92
00:09:17.274 --> 00:09:18.304
Give us a kiss.

93
00:09:19.191 --> 00:09:19.972
Love you.

94
00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:22.140
Love you. Oh, I love you.

95
00:09:22.607 --> 00:09:23.685
Bye!

96
00:09:24.398 --> 00:09:25.311
Tootles!

97
00:09:31.356 --> 00:09:33.180
Kids! Kids!

98
00:10:04.226 --> 00:10:06.300
Children soon followed.

99
00:10:06.518 --> 00:10:09.053
First me, then
my sister Irene.


100
00:10:11.809 --> 00:10:14.925
My earliest memory is of the
face of that gentle old man


101
00:10:15.516 --> 00:10:17.341
looking at me and smiling.

102
00:10:18.474 --> 00:10:19.671
And I remember my father

103
00:10:19.932 --> 00:10:21.804
always working with his milpa.

104
00:10:22.682 --> 00:10:24.175
Corn in the back

105
00:10:24.973 --> 00:10:26.763
and beans in front.
And that's


106
00:10:27.015 --> 00:10:29.052
the way it always was
in my house,


107
00:10:29.973 --> 00:10:31.549
for as long as I can remember.

108
00:10:31.848 --> 00:10:32.677
Jose.

109
00:10:34.097 --> 00:10:35.673
Your coffee's ready.

110
00:10:49.554 --> 00:10:50.169
Look.

111
00:10:51.387 --> 00:10:52.879
The children are wonderful.

112
00:10:54.553 --> 00:10:57.550
There is no greater blessing in
all the world than children.


113
00:11:05.426 --> 00:11:06.670
We're going to have another?

114
00:11:08.551 --> 00:11:10.091
Maria, I knew it!

115
00:11:10.676 --> 00:11:12.085
I knew it, Maria.

116
00:11:12.967 --> 00:11:14.507
It's going to be a boy.

117
00:11:15.883 --> 00:11:17.589
I'm going to have another son.

118
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.247
And this one...

119
00:11:19.924 --> 00:11:21.630
is going to be a special boy.

120
00:11:22.341 --> 00:11:24.212
I remember when it happened.

121
00:11:25.299 --> 00:11:27.372
It was that Sunday afternoon,
remember?


122
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.706
That day that old Gomez crashed
his car into the river?


123
00:11:34.048 --> 00:11:35.588
Yes, that was the day.

124
00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:37.213
Maria, I knew it!

125
00:11:39.172 --> 00:11:42.086
Because that day...
I got out of bed...


126
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.419
and I walked out to the porch.

127
00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:46.997
I was standing there...

128
00:11:48.212 --> 00:11:50.002
I looked up into the sky...

129
00:11:51.962 --> 00:11:54.532
And I saw an angel pass by.

130
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.164
An angel?

131
00:11:57.378 --> 00:11:58.326
Yes.

132
00:12:01.336 --> 00:12:02.828
How beautiful.

133
00:12:04.252 --> 00:12:05.495
Tonight we celebrate.

134
00:12:22.833 --> 00:12:25.403
Then came the day
everything changed...


135
00:12:25.791 --> 00:12:28.196
When my mother didn't come home
from the market.


136
00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:48.609
It was the time of
the Great Depression.


137
00:12:49.704 --> 00:12:50.983
I guess some politicians

138
00:12:51.246 --> 00:12:55.819
decided that the Mexicanos were
responsible for the whole thing.


139
00:12:56.412 --> 00:12:58.532
I mean, they were taking up
a lot of jobs.


140
00:12:58.745 --> 00:12:59.574
There's been a mistake!

141
00:12:59.786 --> 00:13:02.867
Jobs that were needed for what
they called " real" Americans.


142
00:13:03.161 --> 00:13:04.783
I have to get home
to my children!


143
00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:09.487
So La Migra made
some big sweeps


144
00:13:09.743 --> 00:13:13.238
through the barrio, and they
rounded up everyone they could.


145
00:13:15.034 --> 00:13:16.989
- Move along, lady!
- No! I live here!


146
00:13:17.909 --> 00:13:19.105
No! I belong here!

147
00:13:24.574 --> 00:13:27.986
It didn't matter if you were
a citizen. If you looked


148
00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:30.563
Mexicano, you were picked up
and shipped out.


149
00:13:32.198 --> 00:13:35.646
She'd just been out shopping.
She wasn't allowed to come home.


150
00:13:35.865 --> 00:13:37.357
My father was never told.

151
00:13:39.989 --> 00:13:42.145
She was all alone
and she was pregnant.


152
00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:44.896
All these things really happened.

153
00:13:45.447 --> 00:13:47.899
The year was 1933.

154
00:13:48.155 --> 00:13:52.610
Lock up! Back!
Okay, roll her out!


155
00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:33.978
The Southern Pacific Railroad
made the US Government a deal.


156
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.188
For 14 dollars and 75 cents
a head


157
00:14:37.773 --> 00:14:41.304
they took the Mexicanos all the
way back into Central Mexico


158
00:14:41.939 --> 00:14:44.510
hoping they would never
be able to get back.


159
00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:58.977
Maria?
It's not possible.


160
00:14:59.187 --> 00:15:00.679
Is it you?

161
00:15:00.895 --> 00:15:02.174
It's me, Aunt.

162
00:15:02.645 --> 00:15:06.341
Holy Virgin! You've come from
so far. You've travelled so long.


163
00:15:07.686 --> 00:15:10.470
You have to eat and rest.
Come.


164
00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.383
What are you going to do, Maria?

165
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.265
I'm going to have my child.

166
00:15:18.684 --> 00:15:20.307
I will work.

167
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.134
And when my child is old enough,

168
00:15:25.975 --> 00:15:28.593
I'll return to my family
in California.


169
00:15:29.058 --> 00:15:30.301
California?

170
00:15:30.599 --> 00:15:33.431
But that's impossible, Maria.
It's very far...


171
00:15:33.682 --> 00:15:35.139
...and with a child?

172
00:15:35.349 --> 00:15:39.472
You'll die before you get there.
And your child will die, too.


173
00:15:39.973 --> 00:15:42.757
You must have faith
in the Virgin.


174
00:15:43.806 --> 00:15:46.638
Some good always comes from bad.

175
00:15:47.139 --> 00:15:49.461
I have faith in the Virgin.

176
00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.343
And the Virgin does not want
this for our family.


177
00:15:55.804 --> 00:15:58.423
She wants me to return
to my husband...


178
00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:02.589
and to raise our children
together.


179
00:16:06.136 --> 00:16:10.212
And nothing in the world...

180
00:16:12.844 --> 00:16:14.502
will stop me.

181
00:16:42.631 --> 00:16:44.917
I remember the day
they buried El Californio


182
00:16:45.173 --> 00:16:46.665
in the backyard.

183
00:16:47.714 --> 00:16:50.416
He left a will and left
everything to my father.


184
00:16:52.005 --> 00:16:53.711
But he made it very clear.

185
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.834
He didn't want to have
nothing to do with


186
00:16:57.088 --> 00:17:00.287
the " pinche" church or
the " pinche" government.


187
00:17:00.754 --> 00:17:03.420
He wanted to be buried
right behind the house


188
00:17:03.712 --> 00:17:05.039
under the cornfield.

189
00:17:11.211 --> 00:17:13.166
And El Californio said exactly

190
00:17:13.419 --> 00:17:15.539
what he wanted written
on his grave marker:


191
00:17:16.377 --> 00:17:19.209
Don Alejandro Vazquez,
El Californio.


192
00:17:20.209 --> 00:17:21.999
Died 1934.

193
00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:27.076
When I was born here this
was Mexico. And where I lie,


194
00:17:27.375 --> 00:17:29.165
this is still...

195
00:17:29.708 --> 00:17:30.656
Mexico.

196
00:17:40.832 --> 00:17:42.656
My mother kept her promise.

197
00:17:43.206 --> 00:17:46.986
And when my brother Chucho
was old enough, she set off


198
00:17:47.248 --> 00:17:51.075
on her long journey home. But
the rains came early that year.


199
00:17:51.789 --> 00:17:53.613
She had gone too far
to turn back.


200
00:18:09.453 --> 00:18:11.609
Please, Sir.
I must get across.


201
00:18:12.577 --> 00:18:14.568
The water is very high.

202
00:18:14.827 --> 00:18:17.031
I have to keep going.
I can't turn back. Please.


203
00:18:17.577 --> 00:18:21.072
Wait until later in the year,
when the water is lower.


204
00:18:21.285 --> 00:18:24.318
I'll never be able
to make it here again. Never.


205
00:18:24.867 --> 00:18:27.190
Please.
I have to get across.


206
00:18:28.867 --> 00:18:29.980
Please.

207
00:18:30.492 --> 00:18:31.440
All right.

208
00:18:33.908 --> 00:18:34.689
Come on.

209
00:18:42.907 --> 00:18:43.736
Careful.

210
00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.363
Hold on to me, Chucho.

211
00:18:48.406 --> 00:18:51.190
The spirit of the river
is evil and powerful.


212
00:19:00.988 --> 00:19:02.184
An owl...

213
00:19:05.237 --> 00:19:06.481
in the daytime.

214
00:19:53.397 --> 00:19:54.641
Please don't let go of me!

215
00:20:04.646 --> 00:20:05.475
Ma'am!

216
00:20:52.098 --> 00:20:53.092
Chucho!

217
00:21:43.299 --> 00:21:44.756
Will he get well?

218
00:21:45.132 --> 00:21:46.625
He won't die...

219
00:21:47.424 --> 00:21:48.667
Please help me.

220
00:21:48.882 --> 00:21:51.500
The river spirit wants
your baby.


221
00:21:51.715 --> 00:21:54.285
We will try to save him,

222
00:21:54.548 --> 00:21:59.086
but you must pray
to the Virgin.


223
00:22:35.084 --> 00:22:38.330
Two years had passed since
my mother was taken away.


224
00:22:39.083 --> 00:22:41.121
My father lost hope.

225
00:22:41.958 --> 00:22:45.738
But he kept working to
take care of me and Irene.


226
00:23:11.662 --> 00:23:15.158
I promised La Virgen
I would come back to you.


227
00:23:21.536 --> 00:23:22.815
This is your son.

228
00:23:24.619 --> 00:23:26.028
His name is Chucho.

229
00:23:40.283 --> 00:23:42.190
Oh, Maria, it's a miracle!

230
00:23:43.283 --> 00:23:44.989
This is a miracle.

231
00:24:31.318 --> 00:24:33.605
Well, there he is,
all grown up.


232
00:24:34.068 --> 00:24:35.609
My brother Chucho.

233
00:24:35.818 --> 00:24:37.855
And he did grow up into
something special.


234
00:24:38.359 --> 00:24:40.812
But not quite what
my father had imagined.


235
00:24:41.026 --> 00:24:44.935
Chucho was one of the baddest
" pachucos" on the whole east side.


236
00:24:46.691 --> 00:24:49.014
My younger sister Toni,
God bless her.


237
00:24:49.233 --> 00:24:52.230
Pretty as an angel, but
she could get a little bossy.


238
00:24:52.441 --> 00:24:55.687
Hurry up, hermano! You'll miss
your own sister's wedding!


239
00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:00.766
What's with you? It's just a pair
of pants, not the Mona Lisa!


240
00:25:00.981 --> 00:25:03.765
Hey, listen, hermana.
These are Jimmy's pants, see?


241
00:25:04.022 --> 00:25:06.511
And I want to make sure that
they're properly ironed.


242
00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.685
There's only one person in this
whole world capable of doing that.


243
00:25:08.897 --> 00:25:11.017
- And who is that?
- That's me.


244
00:25:13.729 --> 00:25:18.516
Abûrrateyourself! Get your
big cholo butt moving, ese!


245
00:25:18.937 --> 00:25:22.847
Get Jimmy moving, too, or nobody
will make the wedding on time!


246
00:25:23.811 --> 00:25:26.181
Hey, I ought to iron
your mouth shut!


247
00:25:28.477 --> 00:25:33.051
There I am, home on leave from
the navy. Boy, was I young then.


248
00:25:33.435 --> 00:25:36.635
My family scheduled the wedding
so I wouldn't miss it


249
00:25:36.851 --> 00:25:38.308
because no one could miss it.

250
00:25:38.601 --> 00:25:42.594
- Hurry up. She's going crazy.
- She was born crazy!


251
00:25:42.809 --> 00:25:45.475
- I heard that!
- Come on, hurry up.


252
00:25:45.808 --> 00:25:48.261
- The door, open the door.
- Yeah, I got it, I got it.


253
00:25:48.933 --> 00:25:50.758
See you outside!
Come on.


254
00:25:51.016 --> 00:25:54.595
That my younger brother
Guillermo. Quite a handle, no?


255
00:25:55.057 --> 00:25:57.343
So everybody called him
just Memo.


256
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.846
My sister Irene...

257
00:26:01.098 --> 00:26:03.930
Finally getting married.
Biggest day of her life.


258
00:26:04.139 --> 00:26:07.670
- Let me help you with your dress.
- Hurry up!


259
00:26:11.513 --> 00:26:13.717
Irene, what happened since
you were measured for this?


260
00:26:15.804 --> 00:26:17.712
They must have made a mistake
or something.


261
00:26:19.054 --> 00:26:20.511
Okay, bend over.

262
00:26:20.929 --> 00:26:22.338
All right. One...

263
00:26:23.553 --> 00:26:24.548
two...

264
00:26:25.761 --> 00:26:26.507
three!

265
00:26:26.886 --> 00:26:28.628
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.


266
00:26:32.594 --> 00:26:33.837
Put these on.

267
00:26:35.177 --> 00:26:36.456
It's my wedding!

268
00:26:51.216 --> 00:26:54.628
And there's Jimmy, the
youngest of the family.


269
00:26:55.382 --> 00:27:00.253
He was a surprise, but he was
the heart of the family.


270
00:27:00.548 --> 00:27:02.290
- Hey, little bato!
- Chucho!


271
00:27:04.965 --> 00:27:08.744
Look, you'll have the finest
pants in the whole wedding.


272
00:27:08.964 --> 00:27:11.287
Look at that crease.
You like them?


273
00:27:11.505 --> 00:27:12.500
What do you say?

274
00:27:14.172 --> 00:27:15.333
Come here, you little...

275
00:27:16.171 --> 00:27:18.920
The house just grew and grew
with the family.


276
00:27:19.254 --> 00:27:22.122
And the rooms weren't planned
much more than the kids were.


277
00:27:22.962 --> 00:27:24.076
But it was home.

278
00:27:24.795 --> 00:27:28.954
And my parents realized their
oldest daughter was leaving.


279
00:27:42.376 --> 00:27:43.917
Now don't get this wrong.

280
00:27:44.126 --> 00:27:48.201
Of course they were happy Irene
was finally getting married.


281
00:28:06.915 --> 00:28:10.362
There was no question about it.
It was a real blast.


282
00:28:25.954 --> 00:28:28.868
It nearly ruined my dad
financially, but he had to show


283
00:28:29.078 --> 00:28:30.619
the world how much
his daughter


284
00:28:30.828 --> 00:28:34.275
meant to him. It took him years
to recover, but then again,


285
00:28:34.536 --> 00:28:35.910
what's money for?

286
00:28:43.368 --> 00:28:44.232
Just a minute.

287
00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:45.607
Ready?

288
00:28:45.826 --> 00:28:47.982
Okay everybody, smile big.

289
00:29:00.116 --> 00:29:03.694
It was customary for the father
of the bride to say a few words.


290
00:29:05.948 --> 00:29:07.986
My father wasn't
a good speaker, but


291
00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.315
he had to do his duty.

292
00:29:10.531 --> 00:29:12.272
I want to make a brindis...

293
00:29:16.947 --> 00:29:18.190
I want to make a brindis.

294
00:29:20.821 --> 00:29:24.980
To Irene...
And my new son, Gerardo.


295
00:29:26.237 --> 00:29:28.560
Well, you finally...

296
00:29:29.778 --> 00:29:30.975
No, I mean...

297
00:29:32.111 --> 00:29:33.106
It's just...

298
00:29:36.944 --> 00:29:38.058
I'm happy!

299
00:29:44.193 --> 00:29:47.226
A good wife's the best thing that
can happen to a man in his life.


300
00:29:49.234 --> 00:29:51.520
I know, because I have Maria.

301
00:29:51.776 --> 00:29:53.268
Yeah. Come on, Maria.

302
00:29:53.484 --> 00:29:56.896
You know, if it wasn't for you,
there wouldn't be anything.


303
00:29:57.483 --> 00:29:59.024
This, this is my wife, Maria.

304
00:30:01.733 --> 00:30:05.014
And... and this is
my other daughter,


305
00:30:05.357 --> 00:30:06.518
Toni. Yeah...

306
00:30:06.857 --> 00:30:08.136
And Paco! Paco...

307
00:30:08.398 --> 00:30:10.886
He's in the Navy! Come on.
Come on over here.


308
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:13.145
And, and... and Guillermo.

309
00:30:13.481 --> 00:30:14.725
Come on, over here.

310
00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:16.097
And Jimmy.

311
00:30:20.522 --> 00:30:21.635
And my son Chucho!

312
00:30:29.604 --> 00:30:31.594
The greatest riches a man
can have in his life.


313
00:30:41.727 --> 00:30:44.346
It was one of the greatest days
in the history


314
00:30:44.643 --> 00:30:45.805
of my family.

315
00:30:57.642 --> 00:30:59.383
I'm sorry. I stepped
on your foot.


316
00:31:02.266 --> 00:31:04.505
Man, I hate this mariachi shit.

317
00:31:08.682 --> 00:31:10.838
My sister Toni was a wow.

318
00:31:11.223 --> 00:31:14.719
All the guys on the whole east
side fantasized about her.


319
00:31:15.098 --> 00:31:16.507
She had been
Queen of the Fiesta.


320
00:31:16.889 --> 00:31:19.803
And every guy hoped
that he might be


321
00:31:20.014 --> 00:31:21.092
the lucky one.

322
00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:26.841
I'd give my left nut for 10
minutes with her in my Chevy.


323
00:31:52.134 --> 00:31:54.041
Their leader was Butch Mejia

324
00:31:54.259 --> 00:31:55.882
from El Rincon.

325
00:32:06.466 --> 00:32:10.080
Of course, he and my brother had
never done anything to each other.


326
00:32:16.381 --> 00:32:18.537
But they were full
of hate and anger


327
00:32:19.006 --> 00:32:21.576
and nowhere to put it
except into each other.


328
00:32:22.172 --> 00:32:24.790
I hear your fat sister
is getting married, puto.


329
00:32:26.255 --> 00:32:29.833
I feel sorry for that guy. He has
to spend the night with a pig.


330
00:32:32.879 --> 00:32:34.253
And I'll tell you
another thing.


331
00:32:38.128 --> 00:32:38.744
Fuck you, puto!

332
00:32:39.628 --> 00:32:41.749
Listen to me, puto cabrûn.

333
00:32:42.211 --> 00:32:45.078
Today is a very special day
for my family.


334
00:32:45.419 --> 00:32:46.876
And I don't want no trouble.

335
00:32:47.544 --> 00:32:51.288
So I give you permission...
Today, just today...


336
00:32:52.251 --> 00:32:54.289
...to say anything
you want to me.


337
00:32:54.793 --> 00:32:57.909
But I swear to God,
if you bust in there


338
00:32:58.209 --> 00:32:59.488
and make any trouble...

339
00:32:59.917 --> 00:33:01.291
I'll find you, cabrûn.

340
00:33:01.917 --> 00:33:03.374
I'll cut your dick off

341
00:33:03.875 --> 00:33:05.948
and shove it down
your goddamn throat.


342
00:33:09.374 --> 00:33:12.407
They were both so full of macho
bullshit it was incredible.


343
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:13.988
So go ahead.

344
00:33:14.873 --> 00:33:15.903
Insult me.

345
00:33:16.748 --> 00:33:18.241
I give you permission.

346
00:33:26.705 --> 00:33:28.032
Have it your way, puto.

347
00:33:28.705 --> 00:33:29.984
But this isn't over.

348
00:33:31.288 --> 00:33:32.994
The next time these people
come together,


349
00:33:33.496 --> 00:33:35.072
they're going to be
dressed in black


350
00:33:35.454 --> 00:33:37.658
for your funeral, pinche puto.

351
00:33:55.868 --> 00:33:56.780
Go home, Butch!

352
00:33:58.076 --> 00:34:00.196
- Go home, boy!
- Don't pay him no mind.


353
00:34:03.158 --> 00:34:04.948
Everybody ready?

354
00:34:06.408 --> 00:34:07.403
One...

355
00:34:08.116 --> 00:34:08.945
two...

356
00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:10.233
three!

357
00:34:14.574 --> 00:34:15.770
That's not fair.

358
00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.353
Here, do it again!

359
00:34:35.196 --> 00:34:37.435
You're making your sister
feel very bad.


360
00:34:37.737 --> 00:34:40.651
No, I... I didn't mean to.
It's just...


361
00:34:43.153 --> 00:34:45.523
It's just that I'm never going
to get married. I can't.


362
00:34:45.736 --> 00:34:47.145
She has to do it again.

363
00:34:48.194 --> 00:34:49.059
But why?

364
00:34:52.027 --> 00:34:53.188
I'm going to be a nun.

365
00:34:56.526 --> 00:34:57.770
This is wonderful!

366
00:35:00.276 --> 00:35:01.685
Did you say something to her?

367
00:35:03.692 --> 00:35:05.232
This is wonderful!

368
00:35:08.483 --> 00:35:09.940
Because if it is,
I swear I will...


369
00:35:10.149 --> 00:35:13.100
I've prayed and prayed for
something like this to happen.


370
00:35:19.523 --> 00:35:21.064
Throw the bouquet again,

371
00:35:21.315 --> 00:35:23.767
or it will be bad luck for
your sister. Throw it.


372
00:35:28.105 --> 00:35:29.100
Ready?

373
00:35:33.771 --> 00:35:35.678
Somebody explain
what's happening!


374
00:35:37.687 --> 00:35:41.846
Our daughter, Toni, she's going
to marry Our Lord Jesus.


375
00:35:43.062 --> 00:35:46.225
She's...
She's going to be a nun.


376
00:35:49.936 --> 00:35:51.097
A nun?

377
00:35:51.727 --> 00:35:55.057
Needless to say, word of this
spread like wildfire.


378
00:35:55.268 --> 00:35:56.050
A nun?

379
00:35:57.518 --> 00:35:59.141
What a waste!

380
00:35:59.518 --> 00:36:01.638
What a goaddamn waste!

381
00:36:02.517 --> 00:36:06.048
We all thought it strange that
Toni wanted to become a nun.


382
00:36:06.892 --> 00:36:08.717
But then she always was
the bossy type.


383
00:36:09.517 --> 00:36:12.183
And that's the type that
usually becomes a nun.


384
00:36:20.098 --> 00:36:21.425
Hey, little bato!

385
00:36:22.431 --> 00:36:23.177
Guve us a hand.

386
00:36:26.348 --> 00:36:26.963
How are you doing?

387
00:36:29.264 --> 00:36:31.468
Hey, you guys want to learn
something really hot?


388
00:36:35.096 --> 00:36:39.255
This ain't the bullshit they teach
in school, stuff you never need.


389
00:36:39.679 --> 00:36:41.337
This is something
really important.


390
00:36:42.137 --> 00:36:43.381
I'm going to teach you...

391
00:36:45.595 --> 00:36:46.673
to mambo!

392
00:36:48.553 --> 00:36:50.294
Let's go.
Follow me, okay?


393
00:36:52.177 --> 00:36:54.251
Okay, now first...

394
00:36:55.219 --> 00:36:58.631
take your left leg and
put it out, like this.


395
00:36:59.135 --> 00:37:00.793
One, two, with me!

396
00:37:01.093 --> 00:37:04.707
One, two, with me!
Back, two, with me!


397
00:37:04.967 --> 00:37:06.377
There you go,
put your arms into it!


398
00:37:11.175 --> 00:37:12.964
Okay? All right.

399
00:37:13.716 --> 00:37:14.830
Good.

400
00:37:15.133 --> 00:37:16.081
Come on.

401
00:37:17.674 --> 00:37:19.214
Yeah, you guys are good!

402
00:37:20.465 --> 00:37:21.627
That's right!

403
00:37:25.965 --> 00:37:28.797
- Let's do the mambo now!
- That's right. Let's go!


404
00:37:38.755 --> 00:37:40.164
Eddie, what are you doing?

405
00:37:40.421 --> 00:37:42.127
I told you I don't want you
playing with no pachuco!


406
00:37:42.379 --> 00:37:43.160
Mommy,

407
00:37:43.462 --> 00:37:44.741
I want to stay!

408
00:38:16.166 --> 00:38:17.908
I said mambo!

409
00:38:23.957 --> 00:38:24.905
Jimmy...

410
00:38:27.081 --> 00:38:29.404
We take this old corn...

411
00:38:32.664 --> 00:38:33.612
Then you break it up

412
00:38:34.414 --> 00:38:35.657
and then you bury it.

413
00:38:35.914 --> 00:38:37.904
And that feeds the new corn.

414
00:38:40.663 --> 00:38:42.570
We got a big milpa, huh Papa?

415
00:38:44.037 --> 00:38:47.485
In Michoacan we had a milpa
that was 8 miles long.


416
00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:52.616
The corn was so high that
I once got lost in it.


417
00:38:53.536 --> 00:38:57.316
I walked in there all day,
I didn't even know where I was.


418
00:38:57.786 --> 00:39:00.321
I was a little chavalito
just like you.


419
00:39:03.743 --> 00:39:06.527
Memo was always
doing homework.


420
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:08.319
He did enough homework

421
00:39:08.576 --> 00:39:09.737
for the whole family.

422
00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.195
I'll get it.

423
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:21.900
Here I am always working deep
in the corn, no?


424
00:39:22.116 --> 00:39:23.739
Pulling out the weeds,
pulling weeds,


425
00:39:23.991 --> 00:39:25.780
pulling weeds, and suddenly...

426
00:39:26.032 --> 00:39:29.278
I pull up a snake! You know?
A big old rattlesnake.


427
00:39:29.573 --> 00:39:31.363
At least ten feet long.
Yeah.


428
00:39:31.781 --> 00:39:32.859
There I am.
I dropped him


429
00:39:33.114 --> 00:39:37.771
real fast, no? And I go for this
great big cornstalk and I...


430
00:39:39.447 --> 00:39:42.361
He's still moving. There I go.
There I am. Yeah, yeah...


431
00:39:46.404 --> 00:39:47.731
They say it's important.

432
00:39:49.196 --> 00:39:50.060
I'll be right back.

433
00:39:52.278 --> 00:39:53.605
Close the door.

434
00:40:01.402 --> 00:40:02.315
Hello?

435
00:40:03.277 --> 00:40:05.018
Yes, I'm Jose Sanchez.

436
00:40:08.776 --> 00:40:09.605
What?

437
00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:11.687
The police?

438
00:40:16.359 --> 00:40:17.638
My son Chucho?

439
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:22.396
No, no, no, he couldn't be
involved in anything like that.


440
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:41.929
Where you been?

441
00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:44.678
Out.

442
00:40:45.188 --> 00:40:46.100
Out?

443
00:40:46.688 --> 00:40:47.967
What does that mean?

444
00:40:49.271 --> 00:40:51.937
- It means out.
- You're out of school now.


445
00:40:52.354 --> 00:40:53.467
Are you looking for a job?

446
00:40:55.728 --> 00:40:57.386
No, I'm not.

447
00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:00.511
See. I got money, jefe.

448
00:41:01.894 --> 00:41:03.636
Where do you get this money?

449
00:41:03.936 --> 00:41:05.262
I just get it, that's all.

450
00:41:06.269 --> 00:41:09.053
Selling mota? Is that it?
Selling mota?


451
00:41:10.268 --> 00:41:11.761
What difference does it make?

452
00:41:13.893 --> 00:41:14.971
The police called here tonight.

453
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.589
I didn't raise my children
to be sinvergüenzas!


454
00:41:22.516 --> 00:41:25.467
When I think of all the years
I struggled without complaining.


455
00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:29.879
Like when I came here walking
all the way from Michoacan.


456
00:41:30.099 --> 00:41:32.883
And what your mother went through
to bring you back as a baby


457
00:41:33.098 --> 00:41:35.421
so you grow up to be
a man with respect!


458
00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:37.465
Don't you have any pride?

459
00:41:38.389 --> 00:41:40.842
Look at your sister Irene...
And your brother Paco.


460
00:41:41.306 --> 00:41:42.383
In the Navy!

461
00:41:45.888 --> 00:41:47.795
Selling marijuana
like some hoodlum!


462
00:41:51.637 --> 00:41:52.834
Fuck la dignidad!

463
00:41:53.304 --> 00:41:54.050
Fuck it!

464
00:41:54.595 --> 00:41:56.218
And fuck your struggle!

465
00:41:56.595 --> 00:41:58.502
You think anybody cares
about it here?


466
00:41:59.386 --> 00:42:03.842
This. This is all they respect in
this country. Not la dignidad.


467
00:42:04.344 --> 00:42:06.797
And it don't matter how you
get it, as long as you do.


468
00:42:07.052 --> 00:42:08.426
I don't want to be
like no Mexican!


469
00:42:10.052 --> 00:42:12.256
If you think for one minute
I want to spend all fucking day


470
00:42:12.551 --> 00:42:14.257
pulling up weeds and
mowing lawns,


471
00:42:14.509 --> 00:42:16.334
you got another thing coming.

472
00:42:17.759 --> 00:42:21.254
All right? I don't want to be
like Irene or like Paco.


473
00:42:21.758 --> 00:42:24.081
And most of all,
I don't want to be like you!


474
00:42:39.881 --> 00:42:40.994
Get out of here.

475
00:42:42.464 --> 00:42:43.661
Get out of here!

476
00:42:45.005 --> 00:42:46.167
Get out of here!

477
00:42:53.754 --> 00:42:56.289
Get out of here!
Take this with you!


478
00:43:02.461 --> 00:43:05.459
Why did he leave, Mama?
Why?


479
00:43:06.211 --> 00:43:07.123
He will come back.

480
00:43:09.335 --> 00:43:10.709
He will come back.

481
00:43:15.835 --> 00:43:20.077
There was no communication
between my father and Chucho.


482
00:43:20.542 --> 00:43:22.616
They were from
two different worlds.


483
00:43:24.292 --> 00:43:26.697
To my father, there was
dignity in work.


484
00:43:27.416 --> 00:43:30.284
He crossed the bridges every
morning to work to support


485
00:43:30.541 --> 00:43:31.489
his family.

486
00:43:32.749 --> 00:43:34.289
My father felt that
he was right


487
00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:35.784
to throw Chucho out
of the house.


488
00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:39.405
But deep down in his heart,
he didn't feel so right.


489
00:43:56.621 --> 00:43:59.702
It's just like heaven,

490
00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:03.153
being here with you.

491
00:44:03.911 --> 00:44:06.944
You're like an angel,

492
00:44:07.828 --> 00:44:10.659
too good to be true.

493
00:44:10.994 --> 00:44:16.030
But after all, I love you.

494
00:44:16.826 --> 00:44:21.364
I do, Angel baby,

495
00:44:21.826 --> 00:44:24.823
my angel baby,

496
00:44:26.492 --> 00:44:28.114
I love you,

497
00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.858
I do.

498
00:44:32.824 --> 00:44:35.656
No one could love you

499
00:44:36.199 --> 00:44:39.149
like I do.

500
00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:04.693
I love you,

501
00:45:06.403 --> 00:45:07.777
I do.

502
00:45:10.402 --> 00:45:13.566
No one could love you

503
00:45:13.819 --> 00:45:15.395
like I do.

504
00:45:27.067 --> 00:45:28.145
Thank you.

505
00:45:46.064 --> 00:45:47.474
The music's

506
00:45:47.731 --> 00:45:50.301
playing,
and the lights are low.


507
00:45:51.855 --> 00:45:54.474
You give me kisses

508
00:45:55.355 --> 00:45:56.385
and pull me close.

509
00:45:57.146 --> 00:46:02.431
Then a little voice inside
my head whispered in my ear,


510
00:46:03.104 --> 00:46:07.049
are you really sincere?

511
00:46:08.395 --> 00:46:10.468
You say you need me

512
00:46:11.353 --> 00:46:15.844
so much tonight,
but will you feel


513
00:46:16.102 --> 00:46:20.012
the same in the morning light?
There's a little voice


514
00:46:20.226 --> 00:46:23.508
inside my head,
whispering in my


515
00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:27.257
ear, are you really

516
00:46:27.517 --> 00:46:29.223
sincere?

517
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.140
Before I give myself

518
00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:33.344
to you,

519
00:46:33.808 --> 00:46:34.921
I want to know...

520
00:46:35.391 --> 00:46:36.172
Cut it, puto.

521
00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:44.846
I said stop fucking with me!

522
00:47:10.011 --> 00:47:10.757
Chucho, you got him!

523
00:47:14.677 --> 00:47:16.632
Chucho, he's got a knife!
Chucho!


524
00:47:54.422 --> 00:47:55.417
Had enough?

525
00:47:56.297 --> 00:47:57.494
Had enough, puto?

526
00:48:22.585 --> 00:48:26.199
Oh my God, Chucho! Come on, baby,
we've got to get out of here.


527
00:48:26.418 --> 00:48:28.124
Come on, Chucho, let's go!
Come on!


528
00:48:28.334 --> 00:48:30.241
Chucho! Come on!

529
00:48:55.456 --> 00:48:58.323
I was stationed in San Diego
when it all came down.


530
00:48:59.413 --> 00:49:03.738
So I was able to come home
to be with the family.


531
00:49:08.954 --> 00:49:10.660
It was the worst for Jimmy.

532
00:49:10.954 --> 00:49:14.283
He was so young, and
he loved Chucho so much.


533
00:49:16.286 --> 00:49:17.909
It was hot that night.

534
00:49:19.036 --> 00:49:21.109
The Santa Ana winds
were blowing.


535
00:49:22.452 --> 00:49:24.489
They called them
"the devil winds".


536
00:49:35.825 --> 00:49:37.022
Hey, little bato.

537
00:49:37.742 --> 00:49:38.985
I brought you this.

538
00:49:40.075 --> 00:49:41.236
No one saw me come in.

539
00:49:42.616 --> 00:49:43.564
All right.

540
00:49:52.781 --> 00:49:55.732
It looks bad, Chucho.
Real bad.


541
00:49:58.197 --> 00:49:59.607
It'll be okay.

542
00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:03.276
Listen, little bato.

543
00:50:05.488 --> 00:50:08.853
You act like nothing's happening,
you know. Just go play


544
00:50:09.071 --> 00:50:10.860
with your friends.
I can


545
00:50:11.071 --> 00:50:14.898
wait out la placa.
They'll never find me here.


546
00:50:15.195 --> 00:50:16.392
Okay, Chucho.

547
00:50:16.945 --> 00:50:18.935
I've been in bad scrapes before.

548
00:50:19.819 --> 00:50:21.442
I'll get out of this okay.

549
00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.557
She's been crying a lot.

550
00:50:32.859 --> 00:50:34.517
Dad never says nothing.

551
00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.264
Tell him...

552
00:50:47.441 --> 00:50:48.435
Tell him...

553
00:50:55.231 --> 00:50:56.688
No, I want to stay here!

554
00:50:57.439 --> 00:50:59.394
Before they wonder
where you are.


555
00:51:10.396 --> 00:51:11.260
All right.

556
00:51:12.354 --> 00:51:15.138
Now go on out there so you
can help me out tomorrow.


557
00:51:34.434 --> 00:51:37.882
You've got to stop this.
Toni will be here any minute.


558
00:51:38.101 --> 00:51:38.965
Give it to me.

559
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:44.094
- You know, if you don't hurry...
- I don't know what to do.


560
00:51:50.016 --> 00:51:51.129
Could he have done

561
00:51:51.724 --> 00:51:55.847
- all they say he did?
- No, Jose. Not Chucho.


562
00:51:56.931 --> 00:51:59.087
I wish I could hold him again.

563
00:52:00.639 --> 00:52:02.345
Like when he was a little boy.

564
00:52:02.681 --> 00:52:04.671
And tell him I forgive him.

565
00:52:08.138 --> 00:52:10.378
I feel I'll never see him again,
and if I can't...


566
00:52:11.263 --> 00:52:15.043
No, Jose. La Virgenwould
never, ever let that happen.


567
00:52:19.178 --> 00:52:20.671
We will see him again.

568
00:52:22.261 --> 00:52:23.540
Of course we will.

569
00:52:49.258 --> 00:52:52.836
The suspect, Jesus Sanchez,
also known as Chucho,


570
00:52:53.049 --> 00:52:55.454
is believed to be in the
surrounding four block area.


571
00:52:55.799 --> 00:52:57.872
He's a known pachuco
gang leader.


572
00:52:58.132 --> 00:53:01.461
A known criminal. He's armed and
extremely dangerous. He has killed


573
00:53:01.714 --> 00:53:05.790
and he will kill again. Do not
hesitate to use your weapons.


574
00:53:06.297 --> 00:53:07.541
Your lives may depend on it.

575
00:53:07.922 --> 00:53:09.959
It's getting dark.
Let's get this job done.


576
00:53:10.255 --> 00:53:12.459
Let's go.
Watch your backs.


577
00:53:25.961 --> 00:53:27.998
It's so good to have you home,
hijo.


578
00:53:28.544 --> 00:53:30.001
I can stay here at least
a week.


579
00:53:30.544 --> 00:53:34.240
It's Toni's first visit, and...
I don't want anything to go wrong.


580
00:53:34.502 --> 00:53:36.871
Don't worry, mi Ama.
It's still the same old Toni.


581
00:53:58.165 --> 00:53:58.994
Hey, Jimmy!

582
00:53:59.290 --> 00:54:00.617
You want to play ball with us?

583
00:54:07.872 --> 00:54:09.246
I like your outfit.

584
00:54:11.622 --> 00:54:13.198
Miralrene's hair.

585
00:54:13.496 --> 00:54:15.321
You like it?
I've been experimenting.


586
00:54:15.705 --> 00:54:17.576
Don't you get hot
in this get-up?


587
00:54:17.871 --> 00:54:19.363
I mean, don't you sweat...

588
00:54:19.621 --> 00:54:21.658
I just offer it up, Memo.

589
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:23.327
Hey, it's time for " Lucy"!

590
00:54:24.703 --> 00:54:26.445
I love that show, Mama!

591
00:54:26.745 --> 00:54:28.403
We always watch it
at the convent.


592
00:54:34.869 --> 00:54:36.196
What's the matter with them?

593
00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:39.398
They don't want to watch
and I don't blame them.


594
00:54:39.868 --> 00:54:40.816
Watch what, honey?

595
00:54:41.534 --> 00:54:42.696
Give me a kiss.

596
00:54:45.201 --> 00:54:46.942
Great catch, Jimmy!

597
00:54:51.283 --> 00:54:52.740
What are you talking about?

598
00:54:58.449 --> 00:55:00.320
I already talked to some
of his friends, jefe.


599
00:55:00.823 --> 00:55:02.979
It was all just an accident.

600
00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:05.697
I'm going to find him, jefe.

601
00:55:05.948 --> 00:55:09.230
I'll get him to turn himself in
before something worse happens.


602
00:55:09.989 --> 00:55:11.896
This'll all clear up.

603
00:56:14.564 --> 00:56:15.760
You what?

604
00:56:16.188 --> 00:56:19.020
Like an idiot,
I went out there to see him.


605
00:56:20.063 --> 00:56:21.686
And I said I was

606
00:56:21.938 --> 00:56:24.224
your agent and you were lined up
for a big musical on Broadway,


607
00:56:24.479 --> 00:56:25.722
and Schary said they didn't want
to stand in your way


608
00:56:25.937 --> 00:56:29.018
so they released you from your
contract and you don't work there.


609
00:56:33.853 --> 00:56:35.559
I really dig Desi.

610
00:56:35.811 --> 00:56:37.090
Throw something.

611
00:56:58.599 --> 00:57:00.839
- You okay, sir?
- Damn spic son of a bitch.


612
00:57:01.057 --> 00:57:02.763
Get the hell after him!
He went down the hill!


613
00:57:18.513 --> 00:57:20.634
You're screwing up our game!

614
00:57:34.553 --> 00:57:36.010
Go get it, Jimmy!

615
00:57:40.427 --> 00:57:42.998
Get the ball!
Go get it, Jimmy!


616
00:57:54.758 --> 00:57:55.623
There he is.

617
00:58:08.673 --> 00:58:10.130
What the hell was that?

618
00:58:40.586 --> 00:58:41.616
We got him.

619
00:58:43.044 --> 00:58:44.750
- We got him, Sarge!
- That was a hell of a shot, kid.


620
00:58:56.584 --> 00:58:57.697
Over there.

621
00:59:19.330 --> 00:59:20.657
They shot him!

622
00:59:21.539 --> 00:59:23.197
No one is allowed here.

623
00:59:23.413 --> 00:59:25.569
He's my son!
Chucho!


624
00:59:28.038 --> 00:59:30.277
- I'm sorry.
- I'm the father. Is he alive?


625
00:59:30.537 --> 00:59:30.987
I don't know.

626
00:59:31.246 --> 00:59:31.944
I have to see him!

627
00:59:32.204 --> 00:59:33.447
No one is allowed!

628
00:59:34.745 --> 00:59:35.242
But I have...

629
00:59:40.494 --> 00:59:42.449
Let's get out of here.
Let's hit the street. Come on.


630
00:59:43.077 --> 00:59:44.486
Back it up!
Let's hit the street!


631
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:50.315
Into the street!
Get on the street!


632
00:59:51.993 --> 00:59:53.485
Get the gurney in here!

633
00:59:57.867 --> 00:59:59.656
Let's get him out of here.
Hold those people back.


634
01:00:00.283 --> 01:00:02.404
- All of them!
- We're starting to get a crowd.


635
01:00:02.616 --> 01:00:05.567
Everybody said that the police
had killed Chucho,


636
01:00:06.324 --> 01:00:08.361
but my mother
never believed that.


637
01:00:09.657 --> 01:00:12.192
She knew that he was meant
to die at the river.


638
01:00:13.657 --> 01:00:16.689
Chucho's whole life had been
on borrowed time.


639
01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:20.354
But you cannot
cheat fate forever.


640
01:00:21.031 --> 01:00:23.732
The spirit of the river
had come back to reclaim


641
01:00:23.947 --> 01:00:25.854
what was rightfully his.

642
01:01:13.482 --> 01:01:14.263
Okay, Sanchez,

643
01:01:14.523 --> 01:01:14.973
roll it up.

644
01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:21.433
He had been in for armed robbery.
No one got hurt,


645
01:01:21.731 --> 01:01:23.970
and a good lawyer could have
gotten him off light.


646
01:01:24.189 --> 01:01:25.847
But a combination of no money

647
01:01:26.105 --> 01:01:30.264
and a bad attitude caught him
a few years in la pinta.


648
01:01:31.479 --> 01:01:35.603
My brother Jimmy was always
a loner. You never really knew


649
01:01:35.854 --> 01:01:39.136
what was going on inside him.
Except the anger.


650
01:01:40.437 --> 01:01:42.178
That was always there.

651
01:01:52.227 --> 01:01:55.177
Down on the riverbed,

652
01:01:55.976 --> 01:01:59.804
down on the riverbed,

653
01:02:00.725 --> 01:02:04.635
down on the riverbed,

654
01:02:04.892 --> 01:02:08.257
I asked my lover
for her hand.


655
01:02:12.516 --> 01:02:14.091
A red-tailed hawk

656
01:02:14.349 --> 01:02:16.588
circled overhead.

657
01:02:17.307 --> 01:02:20.008
A red-tailed hawk
circled overhead.


658
01:02:21.014 --> 01:02:23.088
A red-tailed hawk

659
01:02:23.347 --> 01:02:25.053
circled overhead.

660
01:02:26.472 --> 01:02:29.423
To a church on a hill,
this is what she said:


661
01:02:34.054 --> 01:02:37.668
A monster's claw,
like a big black hand,


662
01:02:37.929 --> 01:02:41.874
A monster's claw,
like a big black hand,


663
01:02:50.635 --> 01:02:54.048
I thought... I'm going to go
out to the cornfield.


664
01:02:55.926 --> 01:02:57.205
Maybe you want to come with me.

665
01:03:02.217 --> 01:03:03.414
Maybe later, all right?

666
01:03:03.925 --> 01:03:05.999
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, okay right.


667
01:03:06.425 --> 01:03:07.455
Later.

668
01:03:09.425 --> 01:03:10.668
Later, Jimmy.

669
01:03:18.923 --> 01:03:22.205
Jimmy's arrival was painful,
but at least it was expected.


670
01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:25.296
A few days later they had
a surprise visitor.


671
01:03:37.088 --> 01:03:38.461
It's her mother!

672
01:03:39.629 --> 01:03:42.461
Marcos! Don't you touch her!

673
01:03:43.003 --> 01:03:45.326
- Don't you touch her!
- Don't talk to the TV.


674
01:03:45.545 --> 01:03:48.626
- He's touching her. He shouldn't.
- Then you should smack his ass.


675
01:03:51.544 --> 01:03:54.660
Good for you! Good for you!
Don't you let him touch you!


676
01:04:09.333 --> 01:04:10.612
Hello, Mama.

677
01:04:16.041 --> 01:04:17.663
I know it's a surprise,
you know...


678
01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:20.405
But I...

679
01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.077
I just wanted
to tell you that...


680
01:04:25.831 --> 01:04:26.944
I left my order.

681
01:04:28.081 --> 01:04:29.324
You've left your order?

682
01:04:29.622 --> 01:04:30.949
- Why?
- What does that mean?


683
01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:34.155
It means I'm not a nun anymore.

684
01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:36.451
So that makes two of us
that are out of the pen.


685
01:04:38.038 --> 01:04:39.696
Would you get me something
to drink, please?


686
01:04:39.996 --> 01:04:40.695
What happened?

687
01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:48.487
It happened when I was working
in Central America, you know,


688
01:04:48.828 --> 01:04:50.486
doing missionary work and...

689
01:04:51.994 --> 01:04:52.859
Thank you.

690
01:04:53.161 --> 01:04:54.819
A lot of things happened, Mama.

691
01:04:57.785 --> 01:04:58.780
That is...

692
01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:01.615
One thing led to another,
and...


693
01:05:05.492 --> 01:05:06.522
I'm married.

694
01:05:09.284 --> 01:05:10.527
I'm married.

695
01:05:12.117 --> 01:05:15.280
But Mama, he's the most wonderful
man I've ever known.


696
01:05:15.866 --> 01:05:17.275
He's good, and...

697
01:05:17.532 --> 01:05:18.729
He's kind, and...

698
01:05:20.157 --> 01:05:22.029
And I'm so happy,
I mean...


699
01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:24.614
We were working together and

700
01:05:24.865 --> 01:05:25.859
he left his order, too.

701
01:05:30.447 --> 01:05:31.774
He left his order?

702
01:05:32.572 --> 01:05:33.650
He was a priest.

703
01:05:39.238 --> 01:05:40.612
Jimmy, Jimmy.
Get a glass of water.


704
01:06:10.775 --> 01:06:14.306
Okay, I know it's hard
for you to understand.


705
01:06:14.608 --> 01:06:15.473
All right?

706
01:06:19.482 --> 01:06:20.856
You don't worry about me.

707
01:06:25.273 --> 01:06:26.931
If it's okay with God...

708
01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.226
I guess it's okay with us.

709
01:06:38.063 --> 01:06:39.805
I'm so happy!

710
01:06:42.229 --> 01:06:45.227
- Oh, really. I am happy.
- So am I.


711
01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:49.224
And I know you're going
to love David.


712
01:06:51.437 --> 01:06:53.592
And I know he's going
to love you.


713
01:06:53.978 --> 01:06:55.684
I'll just go get him.

714
01:06:56.228 --> 01:06:58.017
He's outside in the car.
I brought him.


715
01:06:58.311 --> 01:07:00.017
Yeah, well, bring him in here.
We want to talk to him.


716
01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:01.684
No, he's outside in the car.

717
01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:05.221
I'll just go get him.
Just a minute, all right?


718
01:07:10.101 --> 01:07:10.846
Honey!

719
01:07:11.226 --> 01:07:12.090
Oh, my God.

720
01:07:12.559 --> 01:07:14.466
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.


721
01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.843
Mr. Sanchez?

722
01:07:20.641 --> 01:07:22.133
Hello, Mr. Sanchez.

723
01:07:23.724 --> 01:07:24.636
I'm David Ronconi.

724
01:07:26.765 --> 01:07:27.713
Mrs. Sanchez?

725
01:07:29.723 --> 01:07:31.962
It is so wonderful
to finally meet you.


726
01:07:32.556 --> 01:07:33.753
And this is Jimmy.

727
01:07:34.264 --> 01:07:35.378
What's happening?

728
01:07:35.639 --> 01:07:37.048
Toni's told me a lot
about you.


729
01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.803
- Well...
- This is him.


730
01:07:41.596 --> 01:07:42.923
And this is us.

731
01:07:56.553 --> 01:07:58.294
Our children, Jose.

732
01:08:01.469 --> 01:08:03.673
Antonia married to a priest.

733
01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:06.921
Are you up?

734
01:08:10.843 --> 01:08:13.295
Antonia and a priest.
How can this be possible?


735
01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:17.085
How could things
have changed so much?


736
01:08:17.425 --> 01:08:18.586
And Jimmy...

737
01:08:19.341 --> 01:08:20.964
When I think of Jimmy...

738
01:08:25.466 --> 01:08:27.456
How beautiful he was, remember?

739
01:08:29.048 --> 01:08:29.996
And now...

740
01:08:33.131 --> 01:08:34.126
I know.

741
01:08:35.881 --> 01:08:38.334
What happened to
our children, Maria?


742
01:08:39.339 --> 01:08:42.420
- What did we do wrong?
- I don't know.


743
01:08:49.921 --> 01:08:51.294
Still unmarried.

744
01:08:52.129 --> 01:08:53.870
Wants to be a writer.

745
01:08:54.712 --> 01:08:55.991
A writer!

746
01:08:57.461 --> 01:08:59.535
Who's going to pay you
to do that?


747
01:09:02.544 --> 01:09:03.918
Memo, he's...

748
01:09:05.585 --> 01:09:07.706
He's still in law school, eh?

749
01:09:09.751 --> 01:09:11.706
He's going to be an abogado.

750
01:09:11.959 --> 01:09:12.954
Come on, come on...

751
01:09:13.209 --> 01:09:14.832
Maybe he will do all right.

752
01:09:18.708 --> 01:09:20.948
Thank God for Memo
going to law school,


753
01:09:21.166 --> 01:09:23.571
or they would have never
gotten a good night's sleep.


754
01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:32.659
So what's wrong with wanting
to be a writer?


755
01:09:32.998 --> 01:09:37.489
Besides, my crazy family always
gave me a lot of great material.


756
01:09:39.289 --> 01:09:39.905
Dad was right.

757
01:09:40.997 --> 01:09:43.237
Who's going to pay me
to do that, right?


758
01:09:46.413 --> 01:09:51.319
So I went to work for Irene and
Gerardo. They had a restaurant.


759
01:09:51.538 --> 01:09:56.573
Over the years, both Irene and
her business expanded together.


760
01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:59.196
A nun and a priest!

761
01:10:02.619 --> 01:10:04.325
Pero, a nun and a priest!

762
01:10:04.577 --> 01:10:05.691
Doing it...

763
01:10:08.702 --> 01:10:11.865
I mean, what happens when they
stop being a nun and a priest?


764
01:10:12.076 --> 01:10:15.939
Nothing. They keep doing the same
stuff they used to do before.


765
01:10:16.159 --> 01:10:18.908
The only difference is now
they get to fuck at night.


766
01:10:26.699 --> 01:10:31.652
I don't know what to do.
I've been frantic with worry.


767
01:10:31.949 --> 01:10:36.155
Isabel is... My boys and I love
her very much, and we...


768
01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:39.398
She wouldn't just disappear.
She just wouldn't.


769
01:10:39.614 --> 01:10:40.728
I didn't know where to go.

770
01:10:41.114 --> 01:10:45.522
- Someone said you might help me.
- Gloria, we're going to help you.


771
01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:48.896
- Tell me where the girl was from.
- El Salvador.


772
01:10:50.696 --> 01:10:51.774
What do you think?
Young girl from El Salvador


773
01:10:52.029 --> 01:10:53.191
picked up two days ago.

774
01:10:53.862 --> 01:10:56.979
The legal aid group might be able
to delay the proceedings, but


775
01:10:57.612 --> 01:10:59.649
if we can't trace her...
I mean, it's been two days.


776
01:10:59.945 --> 01:11:02.268
Was she politically involved
in any way in Salvador?


777
01:11:02.736 --> 01:11:04.810
No, not Isabel. She...

778
01:11:05.319 --> 01:11:06.728
Well, you know.
Her father...


779
01:11:06.986 --> 01:11:10.765
was sort of a union organizer.
I think he was killed.


780
01:11:10.985 --> 01:11:12.775
What are the chances?

781
01:11:12.985 --> 01:11:13.897
Not good.

782
01:11:15.610 --> 01:11:18.358
As soon as she gets there, the
police'll pull her off the plane.


783
01:11:19.234 --> 01:11:20.146
What's her full name?

784
01:11:21.442 --> 01:11:22.983
Isabel Magaña.

785
01:11:23.733 --> 01:11:27.099
Are you saying she's in some sort
of danger? Is that it?


786
01:11:27.525 --> 01:11:28.768
That's what I'm saying.

787
01:11:29.274 --> 01:11:30.897
Well, but that,
that just can't be.


788
01:11:31.107 --> 01:11:34.603
They wouldn't return her if she
was in danger, would they?


789
01:11:34.899 --> 01:11:38.844
Wait, she wasn't by any chance
married, or engaged to a citizen?


790
01:11:46.105 --> 01:11:50.181
Come on, tag him, tag him,
homes! I mean, shit, ref.


791
01:11:53.896 --> 01:11:56.598
- How's parole treating you?
- Hey, what are you doing here?


792
01:11:56.812 --> 01:11:58.554
- Check this out.
- Where's Mom and Dad?


793
01:11:58.770 --> 01:12:02.598
Well, pues, Mom's in church,
you know. Dad's mowing lawns.


794
01:12:03.603 --> 01:12:05.226
So what are you doing here?

795
01:12:05.853 --> 01:12:08.057
Jefitaasked me to fix
a couple things in the house.


796
01:12:08.269 --> 01:12:10.260
There's no TV over
at my place.


797
01:12:11.602 --> 01:12:13.095
So what's up with you?

798
01:12:13.852 --> 01:12:15.807
How's shit over there
at your office?


799
01:12:16.726 --> 01:12:17.721
Oh, tough.

800
01:12:18.018 --> 01:12:20.885
We had this case come yesterday,
young girl from Salvador.


801
01:12:21.184 --> 01:12:22.760
She got picked up
by Immigration.


802
01:12:23.434 --> 01:12:24.926
We've been able to trace
where she is,


803
01:12:25.142 --> 01:12:27.346
but if we don't come up with
something, she'll be deported.


804
01:12:27.558 --> 01:12:30.046
- Her father was a union organizer.
- Yeah, right.


805
01:12:30.516 --> 01:12:32.553
So if she's lucky she's going
to end up in jail.


806
01:12:32.891 --> 01:12:34.846
But probably she'll
end up dead.


807
01:12:36.057 --> 01:12:40.299
- David and I put our brains...
- That's a whole lot of brains.


808
01:12:41.431 --> 01:12:43.386
I'm sure you'll come up
with something.


809
01:12:43.931 --> 01:12:45.044
Yeah, well.

810
01:12:45.264 --> 01:12:48.712
We were thinking if we could say
she was engaged to someone...


811
01:12:48.930 --> 01:12:51.134
You know, a citizen,
we could get her out.


812
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:52.543
I know it's a long shot, but...

813
01:12:52.763 --> 01:12:55.595
Nah, that'll never work.
La Migra'snot that dumb.


814
01:12:56.971 --> 01:13:00.550
No, wait. You'd be surprised.
They really are that dumb.


815
01:13:00.762 --> 01:13:02.836
Plus, I think we can make
a good enough case.


816
01:13:03.387 --> 01:13:06.005
We've got to find someone who
would agree to marry her.


817
01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:08.427
- Help me do this.
- We'd, we'd...


818
01:13:08.719 --> 01:13:12.499
have to prove that a wedding
took place to pull it off.


819
01:13:12.927 --> 01:13:14.882
And we'd have to find
someone today.


820
01:13:15.094 --> 01:13:16.634
- Today?
- Yeah.


821
01:13:16.843 --> 01:13:17.756
Forget it.

822
01:13:18.468 --> 01:13:20.458
Like I said,
that's a bad idea.


823
01:13:21.259 --> 01:13:22.172
I mean, come on.

824
01:13:22.884 --> 01:13:23.879
- Even if...
- What?


825
01:13:24.092 --> 01:13:24.838
Well...

826
01:13:25.051 --> 01:13:28.665
Even if la Migrais dumb enough
to buy it, like you say...


827
01:13:28.883 --> 01:13:29.831
Put that up there.

828
01:13:30.675 --> 01:13:32.879
Well, you still need the guy,
right?


829
01:13:33.466 --> 01:13:37.246
Well, I mean, you still need
this famous babosocitizen


830
01:13:37.799 --> 01:13:39.375
who's going to marry
this girl.


831
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:41.627
There's nobody stupid enough
to do that.


832
01:13:42.007 --> 01:13:43.085
Check this out.

833
01:13:47.173 --> 01:13:49.957
Wait a fucking minute here.
You're not thinking that...


834
01:13:50.172 --> 01:13:51.369
Is that why you came over here?

835
01:13:51.589 --> 01:13:54.373
- You want me to marry this ruca?
- I know it's a lot to ask.


836
01:13:54.588 --> 01:13:57.456
- A lot to ask?
- Somebody's life is at stake.


837
01:13:57.671 --> 01:13:58.536
Yeah, right.
My life is at stake!


838
01:13:58.754 --> 01:14:02.368
What the hell is wrong with you?
You got your brains screwed up?


839
01:14:02.629 --> 01:14:06.325
If you'd stop being emotional
you'd see it's not a big deal.


840
01:14:06.545 --> 01:14:07.706
Not a big deal?

841
01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:11.332
That's your problem. You've always
been bossy, since we were little.


842
01:14:11.544 --> 01:14:14.874
You think you know what's best for
everybody. You're a control freak.


843
01:14:15.086 --> 01:14:16.957
Yeah, well, you've always been
a big pendejo. So what?


844
01:14:17.169 --> 01:14:21.493
AII I'm asking you to do is put
your name on a piece of paper.


845
01:14:21.876 --> 01:14:23.038
You're... you're talking
about marriage.


846
01:14:23.251 --> 01:14:24.957
- I don't even know this girl.
- Who cares?


847
01:14:25.167 --> 01:14:28.497
- All you've got to do is...
- Excuse me. Have some respect.


848
01:14:28.792 --> 01:14:29.573
Look...

849
01:14:29.792 --> 01:14:31.581
- You don't have to live with her.
- Do you mind?


850
01:14:31.792 --> 01:14:35.406
Or have babies or anything like
that. Just go through the motions.


851
01:14:35.624 --> 01:14:37.034
Go through the motions?

852
01:14:37.791 --> 01:14:39.034
Go through the motions?

853
01:14:39.582 --> 01:14:42.533
You're talking about marriage,
camala. That's out!


854
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:45.741
Jesus Christ, when did you
become so bourgeois?


855
01:14:45.956 --> 01:14:48.824
Hey, fuck you. And don't ever
call me " bushwhacked" again.


856
01:14:49.456 --> 01:14:50.913
Whatever the fuck that means.

857
01:14:51.706 --> 01:14:52.570
Jimmy...

858
01:14:53.372 --> 01:14:57.365
All it is really is signing your
name and saying " I do".


859
01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:58.492
And if it saves...

860
01:14:59.746 --> 01:15:00.611
Listen to me.

861
01:15:01.038 --> 01:15:03.656
If it saves a girl's life,
then why not?


862
01:15:04.537 --> 01:15:07.653
You and I know the system's
for shit. We know that.


863
01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:11.733
So use the system to fuck up
the system. That's what I say.


864
01:15:11.953 --> 01:15:13.778
You're really starting to piss
me off here, camala.


865
01:15:13.994 --> 01:15:15.736
You always got a way of putting
things so that...


866
01:15:17.077 --> 01:15:19.648
Who the hell are you to tell me
what the fucking truth is?


867
01:15:22.493 --> 01:15:25.242
- I don't want to hear this, Toni.
- Just listen to me for a minute.


868
01:15:25.701 --> 01:15:28.189
Would you relax, please?

869
01:15:28.534 --> 01:15:29.315
Okay.

870
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:30.780
Look.

871
01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:33.481
This could be your way of
getting back at all of them.


872
01:15:33.742 --> 01:15:36.609
Every cop, guard, judge,
the whole system.


873
01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:39.439
Now just think about it.

874
01:15:39.782 --> 01:15:44.605
With this one act you say "fuck
you" to the whole establishment.


875
01:15:49.656 --> 01:15:51.446
If I was a man, 
I would do it.

876
01:16:01.446 --> 01:16:03.520
James Sanchez for Isabel Magaña.

877
01:16:05.071 --> 01:16:07.108
James Sanchez for Isabel Magaña!

878
01:16:07.945 --> 01:16:09.817
- James Sanchez!
- That's me.


879
01:16:10.028 --> 01:16:11.272
- James Sanchez?
- Yeah.


880
01:16:11.487 --> 01:16:15.645
I release into the custody of
James Sanchez. Your I-130?


881
01:16:15.903 --> 01:16:16.399
What?

882
01:16:16.653 --> 01:16:19.022
Do you have your I-130?

883
01:16:20.902 --> 01:16:21.565
Yeah, right. I got it.

884
01:16:21.819 --> 01:16:23.311
Take it out of the envelope,
please.


885
01:16:32.567 --> 01:16:33.846
Okay, sign right here.

886
01:16:39.441 --> 01:16:41.432
You the guy she's going
to marry?


887
01:16:42.774 --> 01:16:43.935
She loves me, man.

888
01:16:44.191 --> 01:16:44.936
Really.

889
01:16:45.524 --> 01:16:48.474
She does. She really misses me,
too. I can feel it.


890
01:16:56.272 --> 01:16:57.599
- Okay.
- Wait.


891
01:16:58.647 --> 01:16:59.890
Your I-2.

892
01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:02.769
Really, she's crazy about me.
We're like this.


893
01:17:04.688 --> 01:17:05.682
Thanks.

894
01:17:08.062 --> 01:17:10.894
By the power invested in me
by the State of California,


895
01:17:11.104 --> 01:17:12.928
I hereby pronounce you
husband and wife.


896
01:17:13.187 --> 01:17:14.265
Could you please sign this?

897
01:17:15.353 --> 01:17:16.348
Go.

898
01:17:33.059 --> 01:17:34.884
Little brother,
you are amazing.


899
01:17:35.225 --> 01:17:36.303
You owe me.

900
01:17:36.683 --> 01:17:37.797
You guys owe me.

901
01:17:38.808 --> 01:17:40.052
Thank you very much.

902
01:17:41.016 --> 01:17:43.256
So, I guess I'll see you all
in divorce court


903
01:17:43.516 --> 01:17:44.795
next week.

904
01:17:45.974 --> 01:17:46.886
Oh, he's kidding.

905
01:17:47.224 --> 01:17:48.172
Constance thank you.

906
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:50.760
We'll see you next time.
Thanks for everything. Thank you.


907
01:17:51.431 --> 01:17:53.801
All right.
We really appreciate it.


908
01:17:59.472 --> 01:18:02.138
- We did it!
- We did it again.


909
01:18:02.472 --> 01:18:04.130
Only you have no brothers left.

910
01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:05.211
I think I have one more.

911
01:18:10.387 --> 01:18:12.378
It was a family emergency.

912
01:18:15.303 --> 01:18:18.087
Irene and I came over from
the Ole CafÈ, and even


913
01:18:18.345 --> 01:18:21.295
Memo was there, all the way
from " pinche" west side.


914
01:18:21.761 --> 01:18:23.467
I don't know what we were all
supposed to do.


915
01:18:23.677 --> 01:18:24.625
Shit!

916
01:18:24.844 --> 01:18:27.841
But in our house, the difference
between a family emergency


917
01:18:28.052 --> 01:18:30.208
and a family party wasn't
that big, you know?


918
01:18:30.468 --> 01:18:32.008
What were you thinking of?

919
01:18:35.092 --> 01:18:35.957
Geez...

920
01:18:44.966 --> 01:18:47.205
This girl says that
you're her husband.


921
01:18:47.757 --> 01:18:48.787
Is that true?

922
01:18:49.799 --> 01:18:52.003
Well, yeah, technically
speaking, but


923
01:18:52.215 --> 01:18:54.170
but hey, it's not like for real
or nothing like that.


924
01:18:55.465 --> 01:18:57.834
Did you marry her,
or did you not marry her?


925
01:18:58.131 --> 01:18:59.588
Yeah, I did. Kind of.

926
01:19:02.422 --> 01:19:03.370
Talk to her, okay?

927
01:19:03.630 --> 01:19:04.660
She can tell you everything.

928
01:19:07.421 --> 01:19:09.412
Ay, Dios. What is this,
the Spanish Inquisition?


929
01:19:10.338 --> 01:19:13.086
Look, all we did was
save a girl's life.


930
01:19:13.421 --> 01:19:16.999
And it wasn't easy. So maybe
somebody should thank us?


931
01:19:17.212 --> 01:19:18.585
That's right. Maybe somebody
should thank us.


932
01:19:18.836 --> 01:19:21.503
- Look, I've got some shit to do.
- No, you've got nothing to do!


933
01:19:21.753 --> 01:19:22.286
Nothing!

934
01:19:22.711 --> 01:19:24.287
Listen to me, both of you.

935
01:19:25.127 --> 01:19:29.203
You always know what's right for
everybody with your polìtica.


936
01:19:30.002 --> 01:19:32.454
But did anyone ask Isabel
what she wanted?


937
01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:35.206
What do you mean,
what she wanted?


938
01:19:35.917 --> 01:19:39.614
Maybe we should have made some
coffee and invited the neighbors.


939
01:19:40.042 --> 01:19:41.783
Papa, we didn't have time to!

940
01:19:42.167 --> 01:19:45.828
You just messed up this girl's
life without her permission.


941
01:19:48.249 --> 01:19:51.863
Well, they were going to deport
her without her permission.


942
01:19:52.457 --> 01:19:54.862
And when she got off that plane,
they were going to shoot her


943
01:19:55.123 --> 01:19:56.664
without her permission.

944
01:19:56.915 --> 01:19:59.367
So maybe we should have left it
alone, and she would be dead.


945
01:19:59.581 --> 01:20:00.908
All nice and neat.

946
01:20:01.372 --> 01:20:02.830
Tha'ts the problem with life.

947
01:20:03.122 --> 01:20:04.366
It's just so messy.

948
01:20:05.747 --> 01:20:07.156
Does anybody want taquitos?

949
01:20:13.454 --> 01:20:14.911
You young people...

950
01:20:15.662 --> 01:20:18.446
You think no one has ever
lived before you did.


951
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:20.611
No one knows anything
except you.


952
01:20:21.703 --> 01:20:22.781
Don't you think I know

953
01:20:23.036 --> 01:20:25.607
what it feels like to be picked
up by La Migraand sent away?


954
01:20:26.661 --> 01:20:28.532
Without ever seeing
my family?


955
01:20:28.994 --> 01:20:30.451
Without knowing
what will happen?


956
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:37.824
Do you want to tell me
something about survival?


957
01:20:40.076 --> 01:20:41.698
Well, let me tell you this.

958
01:20:41.992 --> 01:20:44.610
There are certain things in life
that are sacred. Sagradas!


959
01:20:47.616 --> 01:20:49.025
And we don't spit on them.

960
01:20:49.324 --> 01:20:52.736
Because without them, it doesn't
matter if we live or die.


961
01:20:53.574 --> 01:20:56.240
Marriage is something
we don't spit on.


962
01:20:57.073 --> 01:20:59.229
Isabel believes
that she is married.


963
01:21:03.447 --> 01:21:04.726
She thinks she's married
to you.


964
01:21:05.572 --> 01:21:08.191
Yeah, well, check it out.
I ain't married to nobody, see?


965
01:21:08.572 --> 01:21:10.230
Hey, you said those two words.

966
01:21:10.946 --> 01:21:12.060
Who asked you to butt in?

967
01:21:12.488 --> 01:21:14.064
And I didn't even
bring a cake.


968
01:21:16.029 --> 01:21:18.564
- Quetouchy!
- You signed a legal document.


969
01:21:19.154 --> 01:21:20.184
Yeah, so what?

970
01:21:21.528 --> 01:21:24.017
So the law believes
that you're married, too.


971
01:21:24.570 --> 01:21:25.849
Yeah, well the law's
pendejo, carnal!


972
01:21:28.069 --> 01:21:31.232
That was a political action.
I'm a goddamn revolutionary!


973
01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:35.022
Look, you.

974
01:21:35.318 --> 01:21:37.060
You're the one who has to do all
the explaining here, hermana.


975
01:21:37.276 --> 01:21:39.066
Cause I told you, I'm never
going to see her again.


976
01:21:40.609 --> 01:21:41.806
I've got some shit to do.

977
01:21:52.649 --> 01:21:56.061
It was late when Jimmy got home
from all the shit he had to do.


978
01:22:17.896 --> 01:22:19.009
Isabel was probably

979
01:22:19.271 --> 01:22:22.718
the first person who didn't
let Toni boss her around.


980
01:22:35.102 --> 01:22:35.966
Hey, you got...

981
01:22:36.643 --> 01:22:38.100
- All right, you've got to go.
- No. I'll go.


982
01:22:38.351 --> 01:22:39.725
- Like right now, okay?
- Sì, sì. I go, I go.


983
01:22:39.934 --> 01:22:42.470
- But I'll be back Friday.
- No! No!


984
01:22:43.226 --> 01:22:45.714
You're not coming back on Friday.
You're not coming back here.


985
01:22:46.267 --> 01:22:48.092
- I must go.
- That's right.


986
01:22:48.308 --> 01:22:51.555
- I'll make some breakfast for you.
- I don't want breakfast!


987
01:22:53.974 --> 01:22:57.339
- I don't have time to talk now.
- Look, you're a real nice girl.


988
01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.631
Bu me and you,
we're not married, okay?


989
01:22:59.890 --> 01:23:01.880
- I'll see you Friday.
- No!


990
01:23:02.098 --> 01:23:03.756
No Friday! You can't...!

991
01:23:06.056 --> 01:23:09.752
Isabel kept coming back
no matter what Jimmy said.


992
01:23:10.305 --> 01:23:13.505
Mainly on weekends and nights
when La Señora didn't need her.


993
01:23:15.471 --> 01:23:18.220
Then some things started
appearing in his apartment


994
01:23:18.513 --> 01:23:23.086
that no self-respecting
" bato loco" would ever have.


995
01:23:37.802 --> 01:23:39.045
I'm your puppet...

996
01:23:43.884 --> 01:23:48.008
- What do you think you're doing?
- You always listen to oldies!


997
01:23:48.217 --> 01:23:49.710
" I'm your puppet,
I'm your puppet".


998
01:23:49.925 --> 01:23:51.038
Who wants to be a puppet?

999
01:23:53.758 --> 01:23:56.957
- This is los clasicos, mujer.
- Oldies! It's time to get new.


1000
01:24:03.507 --> 01:24:04.336
Come on.

1001
01:24:04.715 --> 01:24:05.663
Come on, dance with me.

1002
01:24:05.965 --> 01:24:07.078
You dance. You dance.

1003
01:24:10.464 --> 01:24:11.577
Come on, just try it once.
Here.


1004
01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:14.537
I don't want nobody
seeing me doing this.


1005
01:24:16.047 --> 01:24:16.828
Come on.

1006
01:24:18.463 --> 01:24:20.951
Come on, just try it, okay?

1007
01:24:21.421 --> 01:24:22.120
Out.

1008
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:23.293
Out.

1009
01:24:23.546 --> 01:24:24.079
Out.

1010
01:24:24.337 --> 01:24:25.118
Out.

1011
01:24:26.212 --> 01:24:27.160
Good, I got it.

1012
01:24:28.795 --> 01:24:29.825
I did it.

1013
01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:31.533
Come on.

1014
01:24:32.711 --> 01:24:33.042
See?

1015
01:24:33.294 --> 01:24:33.910
Come try it with me.

1016
01:24:34.961 --> 01:24:35.991
Come on, please.

1017
01:24:36.252 --> 01:24:38.077
Just one more.
Come on, Jimmy. Yes!


1018
01:24:38.294 --> 01:24:39.621
- All right, all right.
- Okay.


1019
01:24:39.835 --> 01:24:41.624
- Out.
- Out.


1020
01:24:41.876 --> 01:24:42.410
Out.

1021
01:24:47.001 --> 01:24:47.700
There you go!

1022
01:24:52.208 --> 01:24:55.123
What are you looking at,
puto? What's up?


1023
01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.122
- Come on.
- All right.


1024
01:24:57.374 --> 01:24:59.993
Right, all right. Let's do it,
let's do it. Put my hand where?


1025
01:25:00.249 --> 01:25:01.197
Here.

1026
01:25:01.457 --> 01:25:03.696
- Just feel me.
- Yeah, I feel you. I feel you.


1027
01:25:10.039 --> 01:25:13.949
- I stepped on your foot.
- Come on, just try again.


1028
01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:15.909
Try it.

1029
01:25:17.997 --> 01:25:19.572
Okay, all right.

1030
01:25:20.038 --> 01:25:21.116
Here you go.

1031
01:25:24.329 --> 01:25:26.319
- See?
- Yeah, I see.


1032
01:25:26.745 --> 01:25:29.115
- See? You're doing it.
- Yeah.


1033
01:25:29.328 --> 01:25:30.406
Great!

1034
01:26:45.568 --> 01:26:46.847
You want to teach me salsa?

1035
01:26:59.566 --> 01:27:01.107
I got them in prison.

1036
01:27:02.108 --> 01:27:04.228
Some of my carnales
cut them for me.


1037
01:27:05.316 --> 01:27:06.559
How is possible?

1038
01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:11.263
Well, with anything
that's sharp, you know?


1039
01:27:14.273 --> 01:27:15.185
A fork.

1040
01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:17.520
Piece of broken glass.

1041
01:27:17.856 --> 01:27:19.229
But the pain...
Que dolor, no?


1042
01:27:22.522 --> 01:27:25.555
Not pain. I mean, not like that.

1043
01:27:26.938 --> 01:27:28.099
What do you mean?

1044
01:27:34.103 --> 01:27:35.560
It's just, it's just...

1045
01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:38.097
fucking anger.

1046
01:27:45.144 --> 01:27:47.596
It just kind of fills me up,
you know?


1047
01:27:59.350 --> 01:28:01.175
You know, it just drowns
everything out.


1048
01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:04.420
And on the inside
I feel like I'm burning.


1049
01:28:07.099 --> 01:28:08.426
You know, like fire.

1050
01:28:12.265 --> 01:28:14.054
And outside I'm just...

1051
01:28:15.098 --> 01:28:16.756
I'm just like a stone.

1052
01:28:17.681 --> 01:28:19.138
So like that day...

1053
01:28:20.264 --> 01:28:24.471
When we robbed the store, I put
my fist through the glass there


1054
01:28:25.305 --> 01:28:26.881
and I saw all this blood.

1055
01:28:28.054 --> 01:28:29.381
But I didn't feel it.

1056
01:28:31.846 --> 01:28:33.504
AII I felt was the anger.

1057
01:28:34.845 --> 01:28:38.293
I'm here on the outside now, and
I don't give a shit about nothing.


1058
01:28:42.719 --> 01:28:44.342
It's like I'm still in prison.

1059
01:28:45.344 --> 01:28:46.374
I'm alone.

1060
01:28:49.135 --> 01:28:49.964
And like this.

1061
01:28:52.426 --> 01:28:55.756
I just keep hearing that
screaming in my head.


1062
01:28:55.967 --> 01:28:57.757
I hear that fucking screaming.

1063
01:29:03.008 --> 01:29:04.797
I know your feelings.

1064
01:29:05.924 --> 01:29:07.121
I know them.

1065
01:29:07.674 --> 01:29:09.297
I feel them, too.

1066
01:29:13.257 --> 01:29:16.041
I go around this big city...

1067
01:29:21.922 --> 01:29:23.084
But I'm alone.

1068
01:29:24.214 --> 01:29:25.836
No one knows me.

1069
01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:31.211
When I was little,
in Salvador,


1070
01:29:32.379 --> 01:29:37.415
los soldadoscame...
at night.


1071
01:29:39.462 --> 01:29:42.246
They pull my father out

1072
01:29:47.877 --> 01:29:49.784
and they kill him right there.

1073
01:29:53.126 --> 01:29:55.449
Right there in front of me.

1074
01:30:00.417 --> 01:30:02.952
I was just...
I was a little girl.


1075
01:30:03.167 --> 01:30:05.287
But I see everything.

1076
01:30:09.333 --> 01:30:13.029
And then we come here,
and I have no time


1077
01:30:13.290 --> 01:30:15.364
to be a child.
Always running.


1078
01:30:15.582 --> 01:30:18.663
I work, work, only work.

1079
01:30:21.748 --> 01:30:23.323
And the family.

1080
01:30:24.164 --> 01:30:28.323
The family I stay with,
they're happy. I see them.


1081
01:30:28.538 --> 01:30:31.370
But it is their happiness,
not mine.


1082
01:30:41.662 --> 01:30:43.486
No one...

1083
01:30:43.703 --> 01:30:45.243
No one knows me.

1084
01:30:47.827 --> 01:30:49.024
I know you.

1085
01:30:50.202 --> 01:30:51.991
I know you, Isabel.

1086
01:30:55.285 --> 01:30:58.401
I saw my brother get killed
right in front of me.


1087
01:31:02.867 --> 01:31:04.407
Just like your father.

1088
01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:10.773
And I was just a boy.

1089
01:31:21.906 --> 01:31:22.735
I know you.

1090
01:31:26.197 --> 01:31:27.441
Hold my hand.

1091
01:31:32.571 --> 01:31:34.313
I know you, Isabel.

1092
01:31:42.487 --> 01:31:43.814
Oh, man!

1093
01:31:45.570 --> 01:31:46.517
Jimmy...

1094
01:31:59.901 --> 01:32:03.064
Now you get in the middle,
and I'll get in.


1095
01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:08.227
Look at Isabel.

1096
01:32:09.775 --> 01:32:12.228
She's 5 months pregnant
and she looks so great.


1097
01:32:13.066 --> 01:32:15.305
Yeah, they're always
getting pregnant.


1098
01:32:15.857 --> 01:32:18.974
Get one trained, teach her some
English so she gets the phone,


1099
01:32:19.232 --> 01:32:21.021
then boom, she's pregnant.

1100
01:32:22.273 --> 01:32:24.394
I can't believe
you just said that.


1101
01:32:24.898 --> 01:32:27.137
Gloria, you know it's true.

1102
01:32:27.731 --> 01:32:29.307
It's not true!

1103
01:32:30.647 --> 01:32:33.100
Isabel's worked for me
for three years.


1104
01:32:33.313 --> 01:32:34.936
She's part of the family.

1105
01:32:35.855 --> 01:32:38.971
I know that I have to find
someone else, but youknow what?


1106
01:32:39.188 --> 01:32:42.766
I'm happy for her.
We're all happy for her.


1107
01:32:49.895 --> 01:32:54.386
And so for the first time Jimmy
joined the parade of workers.


1108
01:32:57.727 --> 01:33:00.724
There was something about
the idea of being a father.


1109
01:33:00.935 --> 01:33:03.174
Tomorrow had never mattered
to him before,


1110
01:33:03.934 --> 01:33:05.972
but now it mattered.

1111
01:33:16.391 --> 01:33:17.386
Hi, Jimmy.

1112
01:33:18.974 --> 01:33:22.137
I came as soon as I could.
I couldn't get off any earlier.


1113
01:33:24.473 --> 01:33:26.594
I love you, too, baby.
I love you, too.


1114
01:33:28.848 --> 01:33:31.798
What's wrong? Something wrong?
Everything all right?


1115
01:33:32.472 --> 01:33:34.095
Then what?
What should I do?


1116
01:33:34.555 --> 01:33:36.795
Should I get somebody?

1117
01:33:37.055 --> 01:33:39.757
I'll get somebody, all right?

1118
01:33:42.596 --> 01:33:44.088
Is there a doctor around here?

1119
01:33:44.304 --> 01:33:46.129
Hey nurse, my wife's
got something wrong.


1120
01:33:46.345 --> 01:33:49.675
Well, I've got to talk to you!
Get the doctor right now!


1121
01:33:54.386 --> 01:33:56.175
Easy, easy...

1122
01:34:01.343 --> 01:34:02.670
Great, Isabel.

1123
01:34:03.676 --> 01:34:04.706
You have a fine-looking boy.

1124
01:34:17.175 --> 01:34:18.964
Come on.
Time for bath.


1125
01:34:25.465 --> 01:34:27.835
Doctor.
She's still bleeding a lot.


1126
01:34:28.590 --> 01:34:29.205
Jesus!

1127
01:34:29.465 --> 01:34:30.163
Mask!

1128
01:34:31.464 --> 01:34:31.914
Sponge!

1129
01:34:32.714 --> 01:34:34.123
- B.P. is going.
- Suture!


1130
01:34:37.297 --> 01:34:38.291
Another sponge!

1131
01:34:40.213 --> 01:34:41.754
Get Kelly!

1132
01:34:42.046 --> 01:34:42.792
Stat!

1133
01:34:53.711 --> 01:34:57.456
"Cihuateteo". That's what
my mother called them.


1134
01:34:58.211 --> 01:35:00.877
The souls of women who
had died giving birth.


1135
01:35:02.002 --> 01:35:04.039
They became "cihuateteo"...

1136
01:35:05.793 --> 01:35:08.495
The spirits that help
the sun to set.


1137
01:35:10.542 --> 01:35:11.656
Without them,

1138
01:35:12.334 --> 01:35:13.328
the sun...

1139
01:35:13.667 --> 01:35:15.657
would not be able to rest.

1140
01:35:22.041 --> 01:35:22.787
Now maybe

1141
01:35:23.041 --> 01:35:26.240
the greatest medical care in the
world could'nt have saved Isabel.


1142
01:35:26.582 --> 01:35:27.577
Maybe they did

1143
01:35:27.832 --> 01:35:29.787
everything for her
that could be done.


1144
01:35:29.998 --> 01:35:31.953
But you couldn't convince
Jimmy of that.


1145
01:35:34.123 --> 01:35:35.153
He knew

1146
01:35:35.372 --> 01:35:39.200
that if Isabel had been at a
fancy hospital on the west side,


1147
01:35:39.663 --> 01:35:41.488
that she would be alive.

1148
01:35:41.747 --> 01:35:42.777
You Dr. McNally?

1149
01:35:42.996 --> 01:35:44.951
- What can I do for you?
- You killed my wife.


1150
01:35:45.163 --> 01:35:47.568
- What are you talking about?
- I said you killed my wife!


1151
01:35:47.787 --> 01:35:51.069
Easy now. My God, you must be
the husband of that young woman.


1152
01:35:51.454 --> 01:35:52.863
What was her name?

1153
01:35:53.078 --> 01:35:54.950
Yeah. You can't even remember
her fucking name, right?


1154
01:35:55.161 --> 01:35:57.945
It's just one spic, more or less.
What difference does it make?


1155
01:35:58.161 --> 01:35:59.073
You son of a bitch!

1156
01:35:59.286 --> 01:36:01.952
- You fucking killed my wife!
- No! We did everything we could!


1157
01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:04.364
We did everything we could.

1158
01:36:05.327 --> 01:36:06.903
What the fuck you doing, man?

1159
01:36:07.326 --> 01:36:10.359
You're fucking up, Jimmy! You
want to go back to la pinta?


1160
01:36:12.617 --> 01:36:14.738
Just grab the fucking shit,
Tamalito!


1161
01:36:17.617 --> 01:36:19.856
Come on, let's go!
MuÈvete! Come on!


1162
01:36:20.075 --> 01:36:23.274
Get the fuck out of here,
Tamalito! Go now!


1163
01:36:34.239 --> 01:36:35.981
I knew you'd come back.

1164
01:36:38.447 --> 01:36:40.521
Your kind always comes back.

1165
01:36:47.363 --> 01:36:49.685
There was a problem about
the baby, little Carlitos.


1166
01:36:50.529 --> 01:36:54.273
Who would take care of him?
Irene already had


1167
01:36:54.528 --> 01:36:55.725
a huge family.

1168
01:36:55.987 --> 01:36:58.522
Toni and David were always too
busy helping other people.


1169
01:36:59.028 --> 01:37:02.191
And Memo and me,
we were just useless


1170
01:37:02.444 --> 01:37:03.309
unmarried men.

1171
01:37:14.484 --> 01:37:16.142
There's nothing to talk about,
Paco.


1172
01:37:16.609 --> 01:37:18.599
I don't want nobody
brnging him to see me.


1173
01:37:19.108 --> 01:37:21.229
I don't want him ever
seeing me in here.


1174
01:37:21.483 --> 01:37:23.024
Jimmy, he's your son.

1175
01:37:24.899 --> 01:37:26.890
Nothing you did matters.

1176
01:37:27.232 --> 01:37:30.893
- Soon as he's old enough...
- You tell him his father's dead.


1177
01:37:32.648 --> 01:37:34.888
You tell him that.
You understand?


1178
01:37:35.731 --> 01:37:37.852
What you're doing
is wrong, man.


1179
01:37:39.814 --> 01:37:41.223
You have no right
to hurt people this...


1180
01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:45.059
I got the right.
I don't want to see nobody.


1181
01:37:46.605 --> 01:37:48.311
I don't want to hear
from nobody.


1182
01:37:50.146 --> 01:37:51.971
You know what this
is going to do to...


1183
01:37:59.728 --> 01:38:00.806
Look-it, you got a son.

1184
01:38:01.061 --> 01:38:02.518
I got nothing, carnal.

1185
01:38:04.102 --> 01:38:05.381
I got nothing.

1186
01:38:07.810 --> 01:38:08.924
I got this.

1187
01:38:10.477 --> 01:38:14.422
I have to think about doing my
time and not letting time do me.


1188
01:38:21.392 --> 01:38:23.465
You just think of me
like I'm dead.


1189
01:38:39.639 --> 01:38:41.511
It hurt Mom and Dad the most.

1190
01:38:41.764 --> 01:38:44.513
Everybody else in the family
was ashamed of Jimmy.


1191
01:38:44.764 --> 01:38:49.088
They never talked about him.
He was like the family fuck-up.


1192
01:38:49.305 --> 01:38:51.094
But I didn't see him
that way.


1193
01:38:52.054 --> 01:38:56.130
To me, Jimmy carried a lot
of shit for the rest of us.


1194
01:38:56.345 --> 01:38:59.545
All the hate, all the rage,
and all the injustice.


1195
01:39:00.512 --> 01:39:02.052
Somehow,
if it wasn't for him,


1196
01:39:02.261 --> 01:39:05.212
we couldn't have gone on to do
all the things we did.


1197
01:39:06.302 --> 01:39:09.419
Me, with my writing,
and Toni, with her politics.


1198
01:39:09.802 --> 01:39:11.425
And most of all Memo,

1199
01:39:11.802 --> 01:39:13.875
the pride and joy
of the family.


1200
01:39:21.592 --> 01:39:22.871
Good night, Mr. Sanchez.

1201
01:39:35.007 --> 01:39:39.580
Carlitos grew up to be more of
a problem than a " bato loco".


1202
01:39:59.670 --> 01:40:00.832
I've known your family

1203
01:40:01.087 --> 01:40:03.124
for a long time, and
they are good people.


1204
01:40:17.626 --> 01:40:20.161
What am I going to do
with you?


1205
01:40:20.376 --> 01:40:22.532
I'm sorry, abuelita.

1206
01:40:22.751 --> 01:40:25.321
I didn't mean to do it.
I didn't.


1207
01:40:25.667 --> 01:40:27.871
I don't know why I did it!

1208
01:40:33.041 --> 01:40:33.905
Come on.

1209
01:40:37.124 --> 01:40:40.868
The corn was tall and green
the day that Jimmy came home.


1210
01:41:16.618 --> 01:41:18.941
Looks like it's been a good year
for the corn there, jefe.


1211
01:41:22.826 --> 01:41:23.939
A good year.

1212
01:41:32.325 --> 01:41:33.521
The corn is strong, but

1213
01:41:33.783 --> 01:41:37.230
so are the weeds.
Ah, you remember...


1214
01:41:46.281 --> 01:41:47.738
Hijo, it's good to see you.

1215
01:41:49.072 --> 01:41:50.234
I'm happy.

1216
01:41:54.155 --> 01:41:56.275
I came to tell you that
I'm going away.


1217
01:41:58.154 --> 01:41:59.695
I need to start over.

1218
01:42:00.987 --> 01:42:02.017
Completely.

1219
01:42:05.028 --> 01:42:05.976
How's Carlitos?

1220
01:42:06.403 --> 01:42:08.358
He gets into
a lot of trouble.


1221
01:42:10.778 --> 01:42:12.934
Perohe's got
a lot of spirit.


1222
01:42:16.777 --> 01:42:17.890
He's a fine boy.

1223
01:42:18.860 --> 01:42:20.234
Just like you.

1224
01:42:23.818 --> 01:42:24.647
That's good.

1225
01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:28.478
I brought this.

1226
01:42:32.858 --> 01:42:34.600
It's the money I made
in la pinta.


1227
01:42:37.899 --> 01:42:41.264
I thought it would, you know...
help out with Carlitos and all.


1228
01:42:42.315 --> 01:42:43.559
Carlitos doesn't need
any money.


1229
01:42:44.773 --> 01:42:46.017
He needs a father.

1230
01:42:47.564 --> 01:42:48.559
He needs you.

1231
01:42:53.647 --> 01:42:54.891
I can't see him now.

1232
01:42:56.438 --> 01:42:58.014
Not the way that I am.

1233
01:43:00.771 --> 01:43:02.892
Maybe later.
Maybe some other time.


1234
01:43:04.396 --> 01:43:05.094
There's no other.

1235
01:43:09.437 --> 01:43:11.143
That time never comes.

1236
01:43:11.895 --> 01:43:12.972
He needs you now.

1237
01:43:15.477 --> 01:43:17.764
Look, I knew you weren't
going to understand.


1238
01:43:20.352 --> 01:43:23.515
Take the money.
I'll send you more.


1239
01:43:36.766 --> 01:43:38.045
I need your help.

1240
01:43:38.266 --> 01:43:39.130
Now!

1241
01:43:57.638 --> 01:43:59.428
Who is he, abuelito?

1242
01:44:00.721 --> 01:44:01.918
That's Jimmy.

1243
01:44:04.013 --> 01:44:04.628
He's your father.

1244
01:44:05.804 --> 01:44:07.261
I don't have a father!

1245
01:44:07.554 --> 01:44:09.343
I don't have a father!

1246
01:44:11.928 --> 01:44:14.677
When Jimmy saw his son,
something happened inside him.


1247
01:44:14.928 --> 01:44:18.210
Something powerful that
he didn't understand.


1248
01:44:29.384 --> 01:44:30.546
We have a surprise.

1249
01:44:31.259 --> 01:44:32.088
Come on, muchacho.

1250
01:44:32.467 --> 01:44:33.876
Hey, little bato.

1251
01:44:35.050 --> 01:44:36.164
How you doing today?

1252
01:44:37.258 --> 01:44:38.253
Check this out.

1253
01:44:44.507 --> 01:44:45.669
That's nice.

1254
01:44:47.965 --> 01:44:48.830
Wow! Cool!

1255
01:44:57.589 --> 01:44:59.460
I hate this!
This is stupid!


1256
01:44:59.797 --> 01:45:02.367
No, Carlitos. It's not stupid.
In the toy store they said...


1257
01:45:02.671 --> 01:45:04.827
They don't know nothing
at the toy store!


1258
01:45:06.088 --> 01:45:07.035
Don't be that way.

1259
01:45:07.379 --> 01:45:08.409
He's your father.

1260
01:45:08.671 --> 01:45:12.000
- He's not my father!
- I am your father, Carlitos.


1261
01:45:12.628 --> 01:45:16.704
This is a stupid toy! Whoever
thinks it's good is just as


1262
01:45:16.961 --> 01:45:17.790
stupid!

1263
01:45:18.086 --> 01:45:18.951
Now get out!

1264
01:45:21.336 --> 01:45:21.951
Get out!

1265
01:45:22.294 --> 01:45:23.407
All right, all right.

1266
01:45:24.044 --> 01:45:24.789
Get out!

1267
01:45:25.835 --> 01:45:27.411
- Get out!
- Carlitos, stop it already.


1268
01:45:28.293 --> 01:45:30.283
Get out! Get out!

1269
01:45:39.875 --> 01:45:42.244
We have to give him
a little time, that's all.


1270
01:45:42.458 --> 01:45:44.911
We're just going to give him
a little time, he'll come around.


1271
01:45:45.291 --> 01:45:47.364
Yeah, he's going
to come out of it.


1272
01:45:47.624 --> 01:45:49.330
But he didn't come around.

1273
01:45:49.540 --> 01:45:51.081
Jimmy tried and tried.

1274
01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:53.494
Everything he did only
made things worse.


1275
01:45:54.081 --> 01:45:58.406
Your father wants to take you to
Disneyland. Don't you want to go?


1276
01:45:58.622 --> 01:46:02.236
No, please. No, please.

1277
01:46:02.455 --> 01:46:04.492
I don't want
to see him anymore.


1278
01:46:19.786 --> 01:46:20.734
He just doesn't want
to go without you.


1279
01:46:21.036 --> 01:46:22.861
No, it's all right.
I understand.


1280
01:46:25.744 --> 01:46:27.734
He ain't got no reson
to want me, jefita.


1281
01:46:29.868 --> 01:46:32.617
I always thought he'd be there
for me when I needed him.


1282
01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:38.942
I never thought about
what he needed.


1283
01:46:41.450 --> 01:46:42.859
I never been there for him.

1284
01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:45.735
So why should I expect him
to be there for me now?


1285
01:46:49.490 --> 01:46:50.320
Here,

1286
01:46:51.199 --> 01:46:53.070
take these and give them
to Irene.


1287
01:46:54.157 --> 01:46:56.526
She can take her kids
or something like that.


1288
01:46:57.489 --> 01:46:58.651
I've got to go, okay?

1289
01:47:01.072 --> 01:47:03.986
Jimmy tried to come back from
the dead, and it wasn't easy.


1290
01:47:04.655 --> 01:47:08.067
But he was trying hard to be
part of la familia again.


1291
01:47:08.738 --> 01:47:13.690
He had the chance of his life
when Memo brought his fiancÈe


1292
01:47:13.946 --> 01:47:18.104
and her parents all the way
from Bel Air to meet everybody.


1293
01:47:19.778 --> 01:47:21.733
Her name was Karen Gillespie.

1294
01:47:21.944 --> 01:47:25.392
She and Memo met at UCLA when
they both were law students.


1295
01:47:25.611 --> 01:47:28.359
And even though she had been
born and raised in LA,


1296
01:47:28.694 --> 01:47:31.395
she and her family had
never been to East LA.


1297
01:47:31.943 --> 01:47:34.147
- Here we are! Yeah.
- This is lovely!


1298
01:47:34.443 --> 01:47:35.391
Thank you.

1299
01:47:36.276 --> 01:47:37.899
- Yes?
- Are those beans?


1300
01:47:39.317 --> 01:47:40.182
That's right.

1301
01:47:40.442 --> 01:47:43.108
My father loves
to plant vegetables.


1302
01:47:43.317 --> 01:47:45.058
I think that's wonderful, Bill.

1303
01:47:48.441 --> 01:47:49.720
Hello, puppy.

1304
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.978
Yeah.

1305
01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:53.646
Don't mind Bandido here.

1306
01:47:53.857 --> 01:47:55.563
He's a little relaxed.

1307
01:47:56.648 --> 01:48:00.060
- He's kind of a fixture here.
- Yes. There you go.


1308
01:48:01.522 --> 01:48:04.189
We've been wanting to meet
your daughter. We've heard...


1309
01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:05.759
I really like your house.

1310
01:48:06.147 --> 01:48:06.976
Thank you.

1311
01:48:07.188 --> 01:48:08.930
After all the introductions,

1312
01:48:09.146 --> 01:48:12.761
we got down to the business of
getting to know each other.


1313
01:48:13.729 --> 01:48:14.262
Well...

1314
01:48:14.979 --> 01:48:16.969
It's so nice to have you.

1315
01:48:17.187 --> 01:48:20.387
Jose and I are very proud to
have you in our home. Welcome.


1316
01:48:20.687 --> 01:48:21.302
Thank you.

1317
01:48:25.686 --> 01:48:27.972
- Ah, yes. Cheers.
- Yes. Cheers.


1318
01:48:28.477 --> 01:48:30.633
Memo always tells us
so much about you.


1319
01:48:30.852 --> 01:48:31.764
Who?

1320
01:48:32.435 --> 01:48:33.679
They call me Memo.

1321
01:48:34.268 --> 01:48:37.431
My family calls me that.
It's diminutive for Guillermo.


1322
01:48:38.393 --> 01:48:40.264
That's William in Spanish.

1323
01:48:40.517 --> 01:48:42.010
Memo is like Bill, see?

1324
01:48:45.225 --> 01:48:46.386
- That's cute.
- Yeah.


1325
01:48:46.683 --> 01:48:47.595
That is cute.

1326
01:48:49.766 --> 01:48:52.929
Well, Karen certainly has
told us about all you folks.


1327
01:48:53.224 --> 01:48:53.591
Oh, yes?

1328
01:48:53.807 --> 01:48:55.181
- Yes, she has.
- Thank you.


1329
01:48:57.015 --> 01:48:58.840
Bill, don't you have
a younger brother?


1330
01:48:59.098 --> 01:49:00.093
Oh, you mean Jimbo.

1331
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:01.219
Hey, Jimbo!

1332
01:49:01.431 --> 01:49:02.461
He's around here.

1333
01:49:04.347 --> 01:49:05.295
This is my son, Jimmy.

1334
01:49:05.556 --> 01:49:06.254
Hello.

1335
01:49:06.472 --> 01:49:08.628
Bill told us you were
away at school.


1336
01:49:10.097 --> 01:49:10.961
School?

1337
01:49:12.721 --> 01:49:13.669
Not exactly school.

1338
01:49:14.471 --> 01:49:17.089
Actually he was in prison
for a little while.


1339
01:49:17.346 --> 01:49:18.838
- Prison?
- I read a lot of


1340
01:49:19.095 --> 01:49:21.002
books, though. That's what
he must have meant.


1341
01:49:23.053 --> 01:49:25.292
Mother, it's just one of
those things. That can happen.


1342
01:49:25.595 --> 01:49:27.964
- It's not Bill's fault.
- No, no.


1343
01:49:38.135 --> 01:49:41.914
So, you folks are from Mexico?

1344
01:49:42.342 --> 01:49:44.333
- Yes.
- Yeah, my father walked here.


1345
01:49:44.592 --> 01:49:47.957
From Michoacan, in 1926.
He was 18.


1346
01:49:48.217 --> 01:49:49.294
- Really?
- Yes.


1347
01:49:49.508 --> 01:49:51.131
Yes, it took me a year
to get here.


1348
01:49:53.008 --> 01:49:54.714
You know...
Now wait, wait, wait.


1349
01:49:54.924 --> 01:49:56.831
I remember when I was
in the Sonora desert.


1350
01:49:57.049 --> 01:49:58.956
I was attacked by bandidos.

1351
01:49:59.215 --> 01:50:00.245
They jumped on me...

1352
01:50:00.465 --> 01:50:01.662
Actually, I've never been

1353
01:50:01.923 --> 01:50:05.335
to Mexico. I've always lived in
Los Angeles, just like yourselves.


1354
01:50:07.089 --> 01:50:10.205
But he already had family here.
Remember, Papa? Your great uncle?


1355
01:50:10.422 --> 01:50:12.578
And he had been born here
when this was Mexico.


1356
01:50:13.047 --> 01:50:15.369
- That must have been long ago.
- Long time ago.


1357
01:50:15.630 --> 01:50:17.703
Not so long. I remember him.
Paco, you remember. What was...?


1358
01:50:17.921 --> 01:50:19.627
El Californio.
He's buried out in the back.


1359
01:50:21.004 --> 01:50:22.247
In the backyard?

1360
01:50:23.878 --> 01:50:25.157
He said in his will
that he wanted to be


1361
01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:26.747
buried in the back.

1362
01:50:27.003 --> 01:50:28.910
That's just an old story!

1363
01:50:29.294 --> 01:50:31.498
There's nobody buried
in the backyard.


1364
01:50:31.752 --> 01:50:33.209
Right, Dad?

1365
01:50:36.502 --> 01:50:40.246
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's an old family story.


1366
01:50:46.209 --> 01:50:47.583
Carlitos, take that
into the back!


1367
01:50:49.958 --> 01:50:52.529
Hey, excuse me, would you care
for some taquitos?


1368
01:50:53.166 --> 01:50:54.742
Yes, I made them.
I made these.


1369
01:50:57.207 --> 01:50:58.120
There's some salsa.

1370
01:50:58.624 --> 01:51:00.081
Well, they look delicious.

1371
01:51:17.580 --> 01:51:18.361
Jimmy!

1372
01:51:18.746 --> 01:51:19.279
No! Put me down!

1373
01:51:20.621 --> 01:51:22.611
He's your kid, man! Why don't
you teach him some manners!


1374
01:51:22.870 --> 01:51:25.323
- I got him, all right?
- Just get him out of here!


1375
01:51:25.537 --> 01:51:28.321
Cabrûn,you think you're better
than anybody in this family!


1376
01:51:28.578 --> 01:51:29.775
Just get him out of here!

1377
01:51:36.619 --> 01:51:38.111
No, come on, come on, come on.

1378
01:51:40.368 --> 01:51:41.777
Put the shirt on!

1379
01:51:42.326 --> 01:51:43.274
Put it on.

1380
01:51:43.534 --> 01:51:46.201
What's the matter with you,
anyway? Come here.


1381
01:51:47.242 --> 01:51:50.489
Those people out there are very
important to your uncle Memo.


1382
01:51:50.742 --> 01:51:53.692
- They'llbe part of la familia.
- Shut up, you fucking asshole!


1383
01:51:54.283 --> 01:51:55.989
Don't you ever talk to me
like that again, okay?


1384
01:51:56.199 --> 01:51:58.901
You understand? I'm your father!
Don't talk to me like that!


1385
01:51:59.157 --> 01:52:03.151
You're not my father!
My father's a big man!


1386
01:52:03.407 --> 01:52:05.065
He's a cowboy in Texas!

1387
01:52:05.281 --> 01:52:07.900
He's even been to the moon
in a real spaceship!


1388
01:52:08.489 --> 01:52:10.231
When he comes for me,

1389
01:52:10.489 --> 01:52:14.434
he'll come in a big car and
we're going back to Texas!


1390
01:52:14.655 --> 01:52:17.439
That is who my father is!
He's not you!


1391
01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:19.651
Come here. Come here.
Carlitos, I'm your father.


1392
01:53:04.107 --> 01:53:05.647
It's like I tried with him.

1393
01:53:08.273 --> 01:53:10.310
And I really don't want
to go away anymore.


1394
01:53:13.397 --> 01:53:14.807
Well, not alone, anyway.

1395
01:53:19.688 --> 01:53:21.394
I just want to be with my son.

1396
01:53:23.396 --> 01:53:24.805
You did your best.

1397
01:53:35.936 --> 01:53:37.677
Sometimes you don't get
things back, you know?


1398
01:53:40.352 --> 01:53:41.382
Sometimes they...

1399
01:53:43.727 --> 01:53:45.764
When they go away,
they go away forever.


1400
01:53:49.851 --> 01:53:51.343
What are you going to do now?

1401
01:53:53.267 --> 01:53:54.724
I was thinking about Texas,
you know?


1402
01:53:56.683 --> 01:53:57.464
Why not?

1403
01:54:00.641 --> 01:54:02.596
Come back a rich man
with a big car.


1404
01:54:13.431 --> 01:54:14.461
But you take care now.

1405
01:54:31.054 --> 01:54:33.423
You make sure you say goodbye
to mi jefita.


1406
01:54:33.637 --> 01:54:36.717
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah. Paco, Toni, Irene...


1407
01:54:37.553 --> 01:54:40.301
Memo, too. You can say
goodbye to him for me.


1408
01:54:44.177 --> 01:54:45.006
What's that?

1409
01:55:10.673 --> 01:55:13.375
I bet I'm in big trouble now.

1410
01:55:13.923 --> 01:55:17.086
No, no...
You're not in trouble.


1411
01:55:17.339 --> 01:55:19.543
Abuelitowill be mad.

1412
01:55:21.922 --> 01:55:24.540
No, I don't think so.
I don't think so.


1413
01:55:25.755 --> 01:55:28.528
But I chopped up all the corn.

1414
01:55:28.713 --> 01:55:30.526
Yeah, but that's nothing.

1415
01:55:30.712 --> 01:55:33.402
We'll just plant some new corn.

1416
01:55:33.837 --> 01:55:36.160
And then with
the broken pieces,


1417
01:55:36.836 --> 01:55:40.000
we just cut it up and
put it in the ground.


1418
01:55:40.211 --> 01:55:42.285
And it feeds all
the rest of the corn.


1419
01:55:42.752 --> 01:55:45.126
Are you going?

1420
01:55:48.710 --> 01:55:50.307
Yeah, I'm going.

1421
01:55:50.418 --> 01:55:53.745
Where you going?

1422
01:55:54.667 --> 01:55:59.823
I thought I would go
look for your father.


1423
01:56:04.708 --> 01:56:06.417
Would you like to come with me?

1424
01:56:06.541 --> 01:56:08.571
I mean...

1425
01:56:08.915 --> 01:56:10.306
Maybe you can help me
find your father.


1426
01:56:11.415 --> 01:56:12.744
You know...

1427
01:56:12.998 --> 01:56:16.715
Maybe you could get to know him
a little better.


1428
01:56:17.123 --> 01:56:18.950
What do you think about that?

1429
01:56:19.247 --> 01:56:24.485
Does my father want me to come?

1430
01:56:25.413 --> 01:56:29.430
Yeah, I think so.
I think he wants you to come.


1431
01:56:29.954 --> 01:56:33.779
Does my father love me?

1432
01:56:33.870 --> 01:56:37.825
Carlitos, your father
loves you very much. - He does.


1433
01:56:38.078 --> 01:56:44.029
- No, he'll just leave me again!

1434
01:56:44.661 --> 01:56:47.237
He's not going
to leave you again.


1435
01:56:47.369 --> 01:56:51.075
Is that a promise?

1436
01:56:54.659 --> 01:56:56.538
That's a promise.

1437
01:56:56.826 --> 01:56:59.874
He'll never, ever
leave me again?


1438
01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:06.939
Your father's never going
to leave you again.


1439
01:57:11.407 --> 01:57:13.651
Oh, God.

1440
01:57:21.406 --> 01:57:23.863
I love you, man.

1441
01:57:24.530 --> 01:57:28.272
I love you, too.

1442
01:58:49.144 --> 01:58:53.239
Carlitos was the last to leave
when he went to live with Jimmy.


1443
01:58:53.268 --> 01:58:57.350
After that my mother and father
lived in the house alone.


1444
01:58:57.518 --> 01:58:58.679
But my mother,

1445
01:58:59.309 --> 01:59:02.180
she believed that everyone
who lived in the house,


1446
01:59:02.434 --> 01:59:05.124
we all left something behind.

1447
01:59:05.308 --> 01:59:08.625
She believed a piece of
our spirits stayed behind,


1448
01:59:08.683 --> 01:59:15.462
and lived...
in all the empty chairs.


1449
02:00:00.301 --> 02:00:02.991
We have had a good life.

1450
02:00:03.676 --> 02:00:07.252
We've been very lucky.

1451
02:00:11.883 --> 02:00:16.872
- It'd have been even better if...
- No, Maria. Don't say it.


1452
02:00:17.257 --> 02:00:18.666
Don't even say it.

1453
02:00:22.632 --> 02:00:25.416
It is wrong to wish for
too much in this life.


1454
02:00:29.297 --> 02:00:31.288
God has been good to us.

1455
02:00:31.964 --> 02:00:33.586
We have been very lucky.

1456
02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:35.993
And our life...

1457
02:00:36.713 --> 02:00:38.336
It has been very...

1458
02:00:39.379 --> 02:00:40.658
Very good.

1459
02:00:43.754 --> 02:00:44.535
You're right.

1460
02:00:49.545 --> 02:00:52.625
We have had a very...
good life.


1461
02:01:11.250 --> 02:01:12.529
I remember...
