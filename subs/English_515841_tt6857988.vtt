1
00:00:14.123 --> 00:00:15.993
Shall we add some blush?

2
00:00:16.123 --> 00:00:17.123
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM

3
00:00:20.832 --> 00:00:22.368
You're perfect!

4
00:00:22.498 --> 00:00:24.748
What more can we do with you?

5
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.207
I'M NOT AN EASY MAN

6
00:01:02.498 --> 00:01:04.993
We have the dress but no princess.

7
00:01:05.123 --> 00:01:07.327
- Oh no!
- What do we do?


8
00:01:07.457 --> 00:01:09.373
Give it to someone else.

9
00:01:15.373 --> 00:01:16.618
Who wants to wear

10
00:01:16.748 --> 00:01:18.207
Snow White's costume?

11
00:01:18.498 --> 00:01:19.498
Me!

12
00:01:20.498 --> 00:01:21.577
<i>I was five.</i>

13
00:01:21.707 --> 00:01:25.577
<i>I was crazy about a girl
who'd never looked at me.</i>


14
00:01:25.707 --> 00:01:27.248
You saved us!

15
00:01:28.748 --> 00:01:31.123
<i>Finally I felt her eyes on me.</i>

16
00:01:33.957 --> 00:01:34.957
Go on.

17
00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:37.332
<i>It was amazing.</i>

18
00:02:01.873 --> 00:02:03.623
Her name was Aurora.

19
00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:05.915
I thought I'd die.

20
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.998
But you didn't.

21
00:02:10.957 --> 00:02:12.623
What does it mean?

22
00:02:13.415 --> 00:02:14.915
Is love dangerous?

23
00:02:15.165 --> 00:02:17.327
No, I'm not afraid of women.

24
00:02:17.457 --> 00:02:21.165
That's not a problem. 
Women like me.

25
00:02:21.957 --> 00:02:23.493
So why are you here?

26
00:02:23.623 --> 00:02:25.082
I told you.

27
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.498
I spend too long brushing my teeth.

28
00:02:29.707 --> 00:02:33.582
At first, it took me three minutes
like dentists recommend.


29
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.207
Now it takes me half an hour.

30
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.832
If I don't do it, 
I feel anxious.

31
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.040
Introducing...

32
00:02:54.832 --> 00:02:56.082
the "boner-o-meter"!

33
00:02:58.123 --> 00:03:01.660
A smartphone app that records
how often you have sex


34
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.665
and lets you compare from year to year.

35
00:03:04.998 --> 00:03:07.785
We have a fun visual aid.

36
00:03:07.915 --> 00:03:10.118
Our guy's penis gets longer,

37
00:03:10.248 --> 00:03:13.498
the more sex he has.
Like Pinocchio's nose.


38
00:03:14.248 --> 00:03:17.077
One, two, three... 25 times.

39
00:03:17.207 --> 00:03:19.040
Now look here.

40
00:03:19.373 --> 00:03:23.457
There's a slight drop
but it's up again in 2016!


41
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.873
What about women?

42
00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:27.665
Good question. Sophie?

43
00:03:27.998 --> 00:03:28.998
Right.

44
00:03:29.165 --> 00:03:30.702
Women are well-represented.

45
00:03:30.832 --> 00:03:32.165
We click on a tab

46
00:03:32.832 --> 00:03:35.660
to pull up their profile then hit select.

47
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.285
Blonde, Asian,

48
00:03:37.415 --> 00:03:38.535
brunette...

49
00:03:38.665 --> 00:03:39.665
Is this a joke?

50
00:03:39.957 --> 00:03:41.540
Kind of.

51
00:03:41.707 --> 00:03:43.332
It's called humor.

52
00:03:43.582 --> 00:03:46.998
I could explain it better
over dinner tonight.


53
00:03:51.457 --> 00:03:52.493
It's great!

54
00:03:52.623 --> 00:03:53.623
I love it.

55
00:03:53.748 --> 00:03:56.993
It's fun, modern,
we can make a gay version.


56
00:03:57.123 --> 00:03:58.248
Jackpot!

57
00:04:00.207 --> 00:04:01.540
- A hit!
- Thanks, boss.


58
00:04:18.832 --> 00:04:21.415
- Care for a drink?
- That's a bit forward.


59
00:04:21.707 --> 00:04:24.957
No, Christophe Lamy
is signing his new book.


60
00:04:26.123 --> 00:04:27.123
The fat guy over there?

61
00:04:29.373 --> 00:04:30.373
Yes.

62
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.623
Champagne? Orange juice?

63
00:04:34.165 --> 00:04:35.207
You're tall.

64
00:04:35.915 --> 00:04:37.123
Is it a problem?

65
00:04:37.957 --> 00:04:39.082
Champagne.

66
00:04:39.582 --> 00:04:42.498
What do you call
champagne and orange juice?


67
00:04:43.248 --> 00:04:44.118
A mimosa.

68
00:04:44.248 --> 00:04:45.327
Excuse me.

69
00:04:45.457 --> 00:04:47.998
Your mouth looks pretty when you say it.

70
00:04:48.957 --> 00:04:49.957
Say it again.

71
00:04:57.248 --> 00:04:58.248
Everything ok?

72
00:04:58.332 --> 00:05:00.743
Fine. I saw you hitting on him.

73
00:05:00.873 --> 00:05:02.123
Spare me!

74
00:05:02.457 --> 00:05:04.535
Did he bother you? 
It's not his style.

75
00:05:04.665 --> 00:05:05.665
You know him?

76
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.290
Twenty years now.

77
00:05:07.498 --> 00:05:08.665
He's sweet.

78
00:05:10.915 --> 00:05:12.373
- Mimosa.
- Again.


79
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.077
Navy suits you, Sybil.

80
00:05:18.207 --> 00:05:19.785
Makes you look serious.

81
00:05:19.915 --> 00:05:21.577
I came straight from work.

82
00:05:21.707 --> 00:05:23.618
What do you do? 
I always forget.

83
00:05:23.748 --> 00:05:24.952
- I'm a lawyer.
- Excuse me.


84
00:05:25.082 --> 00:05:26.118
Come here.

85
00:05:26.248 --> 00:05:27.665
Don't turn round.

86
00:05:28.082 --> 00:05:30.410
Tall brunette, hot lips.

87
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.577
Dream on, she's gotta be gay.

88
00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.327
Who is she?

89
00:05:34.457 --> 00:05:37.040
Alexandra, my assistant. A nightmare.

90
00:05:37.623 --> 00:05:38.785
Damien!

91
00:05:38.915 --> 00:05:40.373
Princess!

92
00:05:41.332 --> 00:05:42.660
How are you?

93
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.790
Where were you?

94
00:05:43.832 --> 00:05:46.243
Susan's ballet audition. We had to go.

95
00:05:46.373 --> 00:05:48.410
What about my book launch?

96
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.332
The world keeps turning.

97
00:05:50.707 --> 00:05:53.785
What now? I'm hungry. 
Can we come over?

98
00:05:53.915 --> 00:05:55.202
Good idea!

99
00:05:55.332 --> 00:05:58.790
Not on a school night. 
I got lots to do.

100
00:05:59.123 --> 00:06:00.957
Lolo, be a sport.

101
00:06:01.332 --> 00:06:02.665
He's a scream.

102
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.660
You have no clue.

103
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.248
You only have yourself to think of.

104
00:06:07.582 --> 00:06:10.207
It's fun to come over all the time,

105
00:06:11.082 --> 00:06:16.457
but it means after work
I have to shop, cook and do the dishes.


106
00:06:16.665 --> 00:06:18.248
We clear the table.

107
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.040
How kind of you.

108
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.243
But it'd be nice to swap roles
on my birthday.


109
00:06:23.373 --> 00:06:24.952
Great idea!

110
00:06:25.082 --> 00:06:26.290
When is it?

111
00:06:27.957 --> 00:06:29.248
Ask Christophe.

112
00:06:29.915 --> 00:06:31.660
Come on, kids. Sybil?

113
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.285
- Is it today?
- I'm in deep shit.


114
00:06:34.415 --> 00:06:36.410
Come on, for chrissakes.

115
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.540
Get on it!

116
00:06:37.665 --> 00:06:40.118
Let's find a flower shop.

117
00:06:40.248 --> 00:06:41.248
She's a pain.

118
00:06:41.498 --> 00:06:42.952
You can go, Alexandra.

119
00:06:43.082 --> 00:06:45.040
See you tomorrow. 
Congrats again!

120
00:06:46.248 --> 00:06:47.998
And when will I see you?

121
00:06:49.207 --> 00:06:50.498
In another life.

122
00:06:58.582 --> 00:07:01.202
Deny it. Does she know you cheated?

123
00:07:01.332 --> 00:07:03.998
- No.
- Deny it! She has no proof.


124
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.790
- Hi Erica.
- Hey Damien.


125
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.493
Time for a quick drink?

126
00:07:07.623 --> 00:07:08.790
Don't tempt me,

127
00:07:09.248 --> 00:07:10.332
naughty girl!

128
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.368
Damien?

129
00:07:18.498 --> 00:07:19.707
Buddy?

130
00:07:22.165 --> 00:07:23.665
FATHER LACHAISE CEMETERY

131
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.952
The ambulance is coming.

132
00:07:38.082 --> 00:07:39.493
Can you see me?

133
00:07:39.623 --> 00:07:40.707
I'm here.

134
00:07:41.915 --> 00:07:44.040
MOTHER LACHAISE CEMETERY

135
00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:46.915
Step aside, young man.

136
00:07:48.998 --> 00:07:50.832
Can you hear me?

137
00:07:51.665 --> 00:07:52.493
Yes.

138
00:07:52.623 --> 00:07:54.415
Open your eyes wide.

139
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.910
You're pretty.

140
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.243
What happened?

141
00:07:57.373 --> 00:07:59.410
Two women were following us.

142
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.118
We started to run
and he hit the post.

143
00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:03.368
I was so scared.

144
00:08:03.498 --> 00:08:05.623
- How old are you?
- Mind your manners!


145
00:08:06.332 --> 00:08:08.535
Are you hurt? Have you been drinking?

146
00:08:08.665 --> 00:08:10.118
Do mimosas count?

147
00:08:10.248 --> 00:08:11.077
Stop it!

148
00:08:11.207 --> 00:08:12.827
Are you on any medication?

149
00:08:12.957 --> 00:08:13.785
The pill, right?

150
00:08:13.915 --> 00:08:16.790
Cut the crap, Christophe! Forgive him.

151
00:08:17.082 --> 00:08:18.207
I'm fine.

152
00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:19.957
I'm going to go home.

153
00:08:20.498 --> 00:08:21.707
How far is it?

154
00:08:21.957 --> 00:08:23.457
A few blocks. How about you?

155
00:08:25.123 --> 00:08:26.748
Lean on me.

156
00:08:27.082 --> 00:08:28.457
I'll be fine, thanks.

157
00:08:30.165 --> 00:08:31.452
Thanks, ladies.

158
00:08:31.582 --> 00:08:32.873
Goodbye, gentlemen.

159
00:08:34.457 --> 00:08:36.498
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.


160
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:38.165
You really scared me.

161
00:08:40.915 --> 00:08:41.952
Enjoying your stroll?

162
00:08:42.082 --> 00:08:43.827
Are you going out without us?

163
00:08:43.957 --> 00:08:46.332
I ordered pizza,
the kids are waiting for you.


164
00:08:46.832 --> 00:08:47.832
See you later.

165
00:08:49.957 --> 00:08:52.160
Sybil's cute, isn't she?

166
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.868
She's not real brawny
but she's got something.


167
00:08:55.998 --> 00:08:57.207
A good catch.

168
00:08:57.498 --> 00:08:59.077
I'm not talking marriage!

169
00:08:59.207 --> 00:09:01.082
These jeans are too tight.

170
00:09:01.665 --> 00:09:04.993
Have I put on weight? 
Maybe they shrunk.

171
00:09:05.123 --> 00:09:06.790
You wearing a push-up?

172
00:09:07.498 --> 00:09:09.415
If your balls sag get 'em done.

173
00:09:09.748 --> 00:09:11.123
You're nuts!

174
00:09:13.207 --> 00:09:15.998
Yeah, it shows when they're fake.

175
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.290
I'm cold.

176
00:09:19.373 --> 00:09:20.998
How much did we drink?

177
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.873
Take my scarf.

178
00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:35.332
Call if you need me.

179
00:09:40.623 --> 00:09:41.952
Lift the seat, Susan!

180
00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:46.123
Dad, can you teach Susan
not to pee on the seat?


181
00:09:46.998 --> 00:09:49.040
Did you do your homework?

182
00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:55.248
Come here, Rocco. 
Who's Daddy's boy?

183
00:10:06.623 --> 00:10:08.207
<i>Quit teasing me!</i>

184
00:10:10.998 --> 00:10:14.373
<i>Your Wonderpants are driving me crazy.</i>

185
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.660
<i>After several accounts by men
were published</i>


186
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.493
<i>by our fellow newswomen,</i>

187
00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:29.452
<i>many politicians have called
for the Paris deputess to step down.</i>


188
00:10:29.582 --> 00:10:32.868
<i>People are speaking out
and we expect to hear more.</i>


189
00:10:32.998 --> 00:10:36.207
<i>The question is, why now?</i>

190
00:11:03.207 --> 00:11:04.665
What the hell?

191
00:11:07.498 --> 00:11:09.123
What are these clothes?

192
00:11:10.457 --> 00:11:12.082
Who put these here?

193
00:11:15.582 --> 00:11:18.123
That crazy Danish bitch?

194
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.373
Where are my jeans?

195
00:11:24.623 --> 00:11:25.623
Fuck.

196
00:11:29.082 --> 00:11:30.207
Grey sweatpants.

197
00:11:31.373 --> 00:11:32.748
And a white T-shirt.

198
00:11:33.665 --> 00:11:34.665
Morning.

199
00:11:35.123 --> 00:11:36.123
Morning!

200
00:11:36.207 --> 00:11:37.415
Nice smile.

201
00:11:37.582 --> 00:11:38.623
Hotty.

202
00:11:46.123 --> 00:11:47.535
Hey! Where's Gladys?

203
00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:49.327
Hi Damien. In her office.

204
00:11:49.457 --> 00:11:51.248
Her office?

205
00:11:51.998 --> 00:11:54.035
Your top's a little see-through.

206
00:11:54.165 --> 00:11:56.785
- Does it turn you on?
- I'm not the problem.


207
00:11:56.915 --> 00:11:58.415
- Stop.
- Hi.


208
00:11:58.915 --> 00:11:59.915
Hey.

209
00:12:02.915 --> 00:12:04.415
Good morning!

210
00:12:08.748 --> 00:12:09.618
I see.

211
00:12:09.748 --> 00:12:12.748
Lots of gals in the office today.

212
00:12:13.748 --> 00:12:15.868
- Where are the men?
- We do our best.


213
00:12:15.998 --> 00:12:17.123
We need to talk.

214
00:12:17.707 --> 00:12:19.665
Nice T-shirt. Sexy.

215
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.790
- I'm all yours.
- After you.


216
00:12:25.248 --> 00:12:27.998
I'll be blunt, 
I didn't pick your project.

217
00:12:31.332 --> 00:12:32.332
Have a seat.

218
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.452
You did a great job.

219
00:12:36.582 --> 00:12:38.707
It's clever, maybe too much so.

220
00:12:39.123 --> 00:12:40.748
Is that what Marco said?

221
00:12:41.165 --> 00:12:42.165
Marco?

222
00:12:42.415 --> 00:12:44.332
I'm sorry, how rude. Coffee?

223
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.702
Marco, two coffees please.

224
00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:48.952
Come on, Sophie, that's enough.

225
00:12:49.082 --> 00:12:50.748
Be realistic, Damien.

226
00:12:50.998 --> 00:12:53.660
The client prefers a more feminine humor,

227
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.285
cruder but to the point.

228
00:12:56.415 --> 00:12:57.873
Yours is too delicate.

229
00:12:58.123 --> 00:13:00.623
It makes sense for a
woman to get the gig.

230
00:13:02.373 --> 00:13:03.998
Super plus. I'm a heavy bleeder.

231
00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:11.915
You know I like you a lot.

232
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:16.415
I like you too, more than you think.

233
00:13:17.248 --> 00:13:20.540
It wouldn't take much
to climb a rung or two.


234
00:13:26.498 --> 00:13:30.410
Fabienne's idea is great
because it's fun, it's modern,


235
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.123
we can make a
lesbian version. It's a hit!

236
00:13:36.748 --> 00:13:38.748
- You ok, Marco?
- Fine, and you?


237
00:13:38.915 --> 00:13:41.535
Lunch later? I brought my quinoa salad.

238
00:13:41.665 --> 00:13:43.373
Can I see what you chose?

239
00:13:46.582 --> 00:13:47.582
Here.

240
00:13:49.248 --> 00:13:50.415
"Vulv-o-meter"?

241
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.915
No, you can't do this!

242
00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:55.373
- It's disgusting!
- See you later.


243
00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:59.290
I...

244
00:14:00.498 --> 00:14:02.082
Whatever you're playing at,

245
00:14:03.248 --> 00:14:04.743
you're gonna regret it.

246
00:14:04.873 --> 00:14:06.707
Sweetie, here's some advice.

247
00:14:06.915 --> 00:14:08.577
Take a few days off.

248
00:14:08.707 --> 00:14:11.743
You're overworked,
take some time for yourself.


249
00:14:11.873 --> 00:14:13.827
Go out, see pals, have a spa day,

250
00:14:13.957 --> 00:14:17.743
or else stay home with your cat,
just get it together.


251
00:14:17.873 --> 00:14:19.332
Will you shut up?

252
00:14:20.707 --> 00:14:21.957
It's my project.

253
00:14:22.665 --> 00:14:24.957
You hear me? Stop messing with me.

254
00:14:29.165 --> 00:14:31.123
Get out and don't come back.

255
00:14:32.207 --> 00:14:33.248
Nutcase.

256
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.040
Dickhead.

257
00:14:41.915 --> 00:14:43.243
A beer, please.

258
00:14:43.373 --> 00:14:44.665
Good morning, sir.

259
00:14:54.082 --> 00:14:55.957
Ma'am? We'd like to order.

260
00:14:59.165 --> 00:15:00.952
May we order, please?

261
00:15:01.082 --> 00:15:02.332
I don't get veiled men.

262
00:15:04.832 --> 00:15:06.915
Why? What have we done?

263
00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:09.748
We're here for coffee, what's wrong?

264
00:15:11.915 --> 00:15:13.582
I say what I like.

265
00:15:13.748 --> 00:15:16.248
This is my place. 
I do what I want.

266
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:18.748
It's always the same.

267
00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.118
Whether it's headscarves or short pants,

268
00:15:22.248 --> 00:15:23.498
men always get blamed.

269
00:15:23.915 --> 00:15:25.707
Women are never at fault!

270
00:15:26.498 --> 00:15:27.498
Isn't that true?

271
00:16:10.457 --> 00:16:11.910
Dad? Mom?

272
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.623
Hello bunny! You look down.

273
00:16:15.123 --> 00:16:16.707
You got a hangdog look.

274
00:16:19.457 --> 00:16:20.623
Here we are.

275
00:16:22.082 --> 00:16:23.660
That's twenty.

276
00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:26.285
Here's ten and two makes twenty.

277
00:16:26.415 --> 00:16:27.868
Thank you, Mr. Fernandez.

278
00:16:27.998 --> 00:16:28.998
How's your dad?

279
00:16:29.082 --> 00:16:32.915
He's like you, never slacks off.
Still doing his nails.


280
00:16:33.457 --> 00:16:35.332
Details count!

281
00:16:36.748 --> 00:16:39.373
- See you next time.
- Goodbye Mr. Fernandez.


282
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.040
Are you having trouble at work, kitten?

283
00:16:44.207 --> 00:16:46.415
If only you had someone to lean on.

284
00:16:47.457 --> 00:16:49.118
Don't start again!

285
00:16:49.248 --> 00:16:51.207
I'd like to have grandkids.

286
00:16:53.998 --> 00:16:55.493
What did I say?

287
00:16:55.623 --> 00:16:58.410
You read the neurologist's report,

288
00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.285
he says the scan was clear.

289
00:17:00.415 --> 00:17:02.498
I don't need to see your X-rays.

290
00:17:03.873 --> 00:17:05.368
Something's wrong.

291
00:17:05.498 --> 00:17:10.207
Two guys thrown out of a bar
because of their headscarves!


292
00:17:11.415 --> 00:17:12.577
The world is insane!

293
00:17:12.707 --> 00:17:14.707
Or I've fallen into a black hole.

294
00:17:15.165 --> 00:17:16.540
A parallel universe.

295
00:17:16.915 --> 00:17:18.873
- You think so?
- Am I nuts?


296
00:17:19.665 --> 00:17:21.660
You seem entirely lucid.

297
00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.035
If I ask who our president is,

298
00:17:25.165 --> 00:17:26.285
you can tell me her name.

299
00:17:26.415 --> 00:17:30.040
But if you couldn't,
I'd refer you to a psychiatrist


300
00:17:30.832 --> 00:17:34.623
or have you committed.
But that doesn't seem necessary.


301
00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:43.373
Watch out!

302
00:18:03.873 --> 00:18:05.873
MOTHER LACHAISE CEMETERY

303
00:18:34.165 --> 00:18:35.290
Hi Sybil.

304
00:18:38.707 --> 00:18:40.290
I'm fine and you?

305
00:18:40.957 --> 00:18:43.040
<i>Want to grab a drink tonight?</i>

306
00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:45.290
Tonight?

307
00:19:01.832 --> 00:19:03.410
It's not what I thought.

308
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.410
The gals at work said it was perfect
but they pulled a prank on me.


309
00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.327
It's ok, no worries!

310
00:19:09.457 --> 00:19:10.832
I love...

311
00:19:12.832 --> 00:19:13.660
Oh boy.

312
00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.165
I didn't notice...

313
00:19:16.873 --> 00:19:19.498
If you're uncomfortable we can leave.

314
00:19:20.123 --> 00:19:21.665
It's ok.

315
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.368
You're rocking the lumberjane look.

316
00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:26.165
Yep, I'm into plaid.

317
00:19:27.707 --> 00:19:29.123
Wait, don't be scared.

318
00:19:29.665 --> 00:19:30.665
There.

319
00:19:31.207 --> 00:19:33.498
What'll you have? Champagne?

320
00:19:34.457 --> 00:19:36.660
Nah, gives me heartburn.

321
00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:37.618
What?

322
00:19:37.748 --> 00:19:40.785
White gives me heartburn.
I'll have a beer.


323
00:19:40.915 --> 00:19:42.915
So much for the beer gut!

324
00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.040
Sorry.

325
00:19:49.415 --> 00:19:51.123
You've got a lovely smile.

326
00:19:52.582 --> 00:19:54.665
- Really?
- No one's told you before?


327
00:19:55.165 --> 00:19:57.582
No, but thanks.

328
00:19:58.915 --> 00:20:00.415
Are you on something?

329
00:20:00.998 --> 00:20:02.373
Maybe.

330
00:20:03.915 --> 00:20:05.707
High on shrooms?

331
00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:07.998
Sorry.

332
00:20:13.207 --> 00:20:14.540
I'm sorry.

333
00:20:22.165 --> 00:20:24.702
He left me because I didn't want kids

334
00:20:24.832 --> 00:20:28.082
and his biological clock was ticking.

335
00:20:30.623 --> 00:20:31.623
You got kids?

336
00:20:31.957 --> 00:20:32.957
No.

337
00:20:32.998 --> 00:20:34.410
Not too painful?

338
00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.457
It's a choice or else I would.

339
00:20:38.123 --> 00:20:41.165
Guys like you are brave.

340
00:21:00.207 --> 00:21:02.373
- Where's the light?
- There.


341
00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:09.035
Sorry, I can't.

342
00:21:09.165 --> 00:21:10.332
Why?

343
00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.790
You look like a monkey!

344
00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:14.498
So what?

345
00:21:16.082 --> 00:21:18.082
I can't touch you.

346
00:21:18.915 --> 00:21:19.993
Sibyl, come on.

347
00:21:20.123 --> 00:21:21.832
Test your boundaries.

348
00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.160
It's just dirty.

349
00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:25.410
Close your eyes.

350
00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.540
Listen.

351
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.165
I'm a monkey!

352
00:21:36.082 --> 00:21:39.540
It's a forward pass! 
Throw her the ball!

353
00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:43.202
Can I have some cash?
I need deodorant pads.


354
00:21:43.332 --> 00:21:45.035
Dad deals with boys' stuff.

355
00:21:45.165 --> 00:21:46.827
It's just nature.

356
00:21:46.957 --> 00:21:48.790
Use mine, I'll buy more.

357
00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.082
Bye, Damien.

358
00:21:52.707 --> 00:21:54.915
- I'm off to ballet.
- Bye!


359
00:21:57.082 --> 00:21:59.123
Maybe your hormones are off.

360
00:21:59.623 --> 00:22:01.243
You're nervous, losing hair,

361
00:22:01.373 --> 00:22:03.082
you need to do something.

362
00:22:03.707 --> 00:22:05.993
It takes work to look good.

363
00:22:06.123 --> 00:22:09.957
What happened yesterday
was a wake-up call.


364
00:22:10.415 --> 00:22:11.582
We're older now.

365
00:22:12.415 --> 00:22:13.952
We used to be sexy

366
00:22:14.082 --> 00:22:15.535
in jeans and a T-shirt,

367
00:22:15.665 --> 00:22:17.207
but now it's not enough.

368
00:22:17.582 --> 00:22:20.410
What'd you decide about your job?

369
00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.082
Where's the damn referee?

370
00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.415
That's a foul! 
Give her a red card!

371
00:22:25.957 --> 00:22:28.040
Your cupcakes are killer, hon.

372
00:22:28.457 --> 00:22:30.832
Please eat them, otherwise I will.

373
00:22:31.415 --> 00:22:33.285
Fired for gross misconduct,

374
00:22:33.415 --> 00:22:34.618
they'll eat you alive.

375
00:22:34.748 --> 00:22:36.368
Lolo and I talked.

376
00:22:36.498 --> 00:22:38.165
Dear, tell him his options.

377
00:22:38.832 --> 00:22:41.665
You can sue them. 
But it'll take forever.

378
00:22:42.332 --> 00:22:46.327
You should enlist the support
of a masculist group


379
00:22:46.457 --> 00:22:49.160
that fights discrimination
against men at work.


380
00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:51.868
Those English bitches are offside!

381
00:22:51.998 --> 00:22:53.290
Look at that!

382
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:54.790
Watch this.

383
00:22:54.832 --> 00:22:55.915
On her own!

384
00:22:56.373 --> 00:22:58.327
Fantastic!

385
00:22:58.457 --> 00:23:00.077
I'm weeping for joy.

386
00:23:00.207 --> 00:23:01.748
Come on, sweetie... Try!

387
00:23:03.832 --> 00:23:04.660
Beautiful!

388
00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.832
Lolo! You're peeing!

389
00:23:07.957 --> 00:23:09.998
My water broke. 
Where's the car keys?

390
00:23:10.248 --> 00:23:12.582
- Shouldn't I drive?
- I'm not made of glass.


391
00:23:16.748 --> 00:23:18.957
Take a deep breath and push.

392
00:23:20.707 --> 00:23:21.957
Now stop.

393
00:23:22.665 --> 00:23:25.248
Let the shoulders through...

394
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.827
I'm sorry, it happened early

395
00:23:38.957 --> 00:23:40.785
or I'd have planned ahead.

396
00:23:40.915 --> 00:23:42.123
It's his boss.

397
00:23:43.748 --> 00:23:44.618
What's up?

398
00:23:44.748 --> 00:23:46.618
His paternity leave is starting.

399
00:23:46.748 --> 00:23:48.415
- She's in a jam.
- Who?


400
00:23:48.832 --> 00:23:49.873
Alexandra.

401
00:23:54.748 --> 00:23:56.415
Alexandra Lamour, who else?

402
00:23:57.457 --> 00:23:58.457
Right!

403
00:23:58.998 --> 00:23:59.868
Of course.

404
00:23:59.998 --> 00:24:04.290
I'll brief whoever you choose.

405
00:24:04.748 --> 00:24:06.457
I dunno, we'll find someone.

406
00:24:13.123 --> 00:24:14.290
Not a bad idea.

407
00:24:15.415 --> 00:24:16.873
Happy to help out.

408
00:24:19.707 --> 00:24:21.332
I may have a solution.

409
00:26:10.582 --> 00:26:11.748
It's open!

410
00:26:17.207 --> 00:26:18.207
Come in.

411
00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.457
Take your shoes off first.

412
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:22.457
Sure. Sorry.

413
00:26:26.332 --> 00:26:29.165
Navy suits you, makes you look serious.

414
00:26:30.915 --> 00:26:32.707
Come here, Fabien. Don't be shy.

415
00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:36.707
Damien.

416
00:26:39.207 --> 00:26:40.540
You're tall.

417
00:26:41.248 --> 00:26:42.248
Is it a problem?

418
00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:44.832
No, it's fine.

419
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:47.910
What's that?

420
00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.660
Ziggy. She's my chameleon.

421
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:51.790
Watch,

422
00:26:51.832 --> 00:26:54.123
she's gonna devour her guest.

423
00:27:00.332 --> 00:27:01.332
What's wrong?

424
00:27:02.082 --> 00:27:04.993
Are my abs distracting you?

425
00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:06.832
Go ahead. Hard as iron.

426
00:27:10.623 --> 00:27:11.623
Harder.

427
00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:13.873
- I'll hurt you.
- Doubt it.


428
00:27:15.998 --> 00:27:16.998
Ok.

429
00:27:18.123 --> 00:27:19.743
I'm in a rush this morning.

430
00:27:19.873 --> 00:27:20.873
A couple of things.

431
00:27:20.957 --> 00:27:24.165
Coffee? No, you make
it while I get ready.

432
00:27:24.498 --> 00:27:25.582
I like it strong.

433
00:27:27.248 --> 00:27:29.665
I like you strong.

434
00:27:40.832 --> 00:27:42.665
That's Mollino's car!

435
00:27:43.415 --> 00:27:45.248
How do you know?

436
00:27:45.457 --> 00:27:48.285
The shape. It's a knockout.

437
00:27:48.415 --> 00:27:49.540
I drove it.

438
00:27:50.123 --> 00:27:51.998
- The Nardi Bisiluro?
- The one.


439
00:27:52.707 --> 00:27:55.035
- Giannini engine.
- 735 cc.


440
00:27:55.165 --> 00:27:56.785
- 62 hp.
- 7000 rpm.


441
00:27:56.915 --> 00:27:58.993
- 990 pounds.
- 24 hours of Le Mans...


442
00:27:59.123 --> 00:28:00.540
1955.

443
00:28:04.332 --> 00:28:07.702
Alright. Your desk is here.

444
00:28:07.832 --> 00:28:09.827
That one's mine, hands off.

445
00:28:09.957 --> 00:28:11.915
I'll give you a to-do list.

446
00:28:12.373 --> 00:28:14.535
It's boring but it'll save my life.

447
00:28:14.665 --> 00:28:15.790
I love Post
-Its.

448
00:28:17.957 --> 00:28:21.035
You'll meet Mr. 
Martel, my housekeeper.

449
00:28:21.165 --> 00:28:23.040
I do my writing elsewhere.

450
00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:25.410
I won't see you today?

451
00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.915
Be a good boy.

452
00:28:27.832 --> 00:28:29.415
Can I ask what you're writing?

453
00:28:29.623 --> 00:28:30.623
No.

454
00:28:31.082 --> 00:28:32.207
You can't.

455
00:28:48.707 --> 00:28:52.707
<i>Of Mice and Women</i>, Jane Steinbeck
<i>Mister Bovary</i>, Georgia Flaubert


456
00:29:56.332 --> 00:29:57.748
Have you read her books?

457
00:29:58.373 --> 00:29:59.415
Nope.

458
00:29:59.582 --> 00:30:00.915
You should.

459
00:30:01.498 --> 00:30:04.790
Not because they're bestsellers.
I'm not like that.


460
00:30:05.123 --> 00:30:08.665
Her stories carry me away.

461
00:30:09.707 --> 00:30:12.207
You can tell a woman wrote them.
So powerful.


462
00:30:13.207 --> 00:30:15.165
Because a woman wrote them?

463
00:30:16.457 --> 00:30:18.373
Why'd I say that? It's dumb.

464
00:30:18.832 --> 00:30:19.998
It is.

465
00:30:20.498 --> 00:30:23.368
I mean they're not sentimental.

466
00:30:23.498 --> 00:30:27.040
There's lots of suspense... I love them!

467
00:30:29.207 --> 00:30:32.202
Hello, I'd like to book
a table for Ms. Lamour


468
00:30:32.332 --> 00:30:34.207
tomorrow evening, for two.

469
00:30:35.582 --> 00:30:38.623
If it's nicer by the patio, sure.

470
00:30:40.123 --> 00:30:41.665
Who's she dining with?

471
00:30:44.248 --> 00:30:47.123
I don't keep a record. 
I couldn't keep up!

472
00:31:03.873 --> 00:31:05.040
Want a hand?

473
00:31:06.248 --> 00:31:07.998
No thanks, I'm almost there.

474
00:31:09.123 --> 00:31:11.952
Give me that.
You'll hurt that pretty back.


475
00:31:12.082 --> 00:31:14.540
- Did you check me out?
- I did.


476
00:31:15.082 --> 00:31:17.160
I'm only trying to help.

477
00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:18.290
Come on!

478
00:31:18.582 --> 00:31:21.660
No, it's ok. Actually, 
I've had enough.

479
00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:23.493
I did everything on the list.

480
00:31:23.623 --> 00:31:26.207
There's your water, here are your keys...

481
00:31:27.582 --> 00:31:30.123
- What do you mean?
- Let's be honest.


482
00:31:30.748 --> 00:31:32.618
I'm not cut out for the job.

483
00:31:32.748 --> 00:31:34.702
What's wrong? You're edgy.

484
00:31:34.832 --> 00:31:36.165
Are you burned out?

485
00:31:36.623 --> 00:31:39.165
You really want to know what's wrong?

486
00:31:39.457 --> 00:31:40.457
I don't belong here.

487
00:31:40.498 --> 00:31:42.832
I woke up one
morning in a crazy world

488
00:31:43.165 --> 00:31:45.748
where women tell me what to do.

489
00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.993
Spare me the masculist babble!

490
00:31:49.123 --> 00:31:51.290
You don't get it! 
How can I explain?

491
00:31:52.582 --> 00:31:55.910
Imagine a world where women
dress up to please me.


492
00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.373
Sometimes I even whistle at them
if they're sexy.


493
00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:00.868
How awful!

494
00:32:00.998 --> 00:32:02.077
You mean wonderful!

495
00:32:02.207 --> 00:32:05.243
A world where I'm no one's secretary,

496
00:32:05.373 --> 00:32:08.660
I design apps
for a mobile marketing agency.


497
00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:09.952
I'm an engineer.

498
00:32:10.082 --> 00:32:12.665
My boss thinks I'm a genius.

499
00:32:13.415 --> 00:32:15.702
I apologize.

500
00:32:15.832 --> 00:32:19.368
I completely forgot
to ask for your résumé.


501
00:32:19.498 --> 00:32:22.540
But it's your fault, you distracted me.

502
00:32:23.248 --> 00:32:25.957
With a fat-ass like Christophe,

503
00:32:26.415 --> 00:32:27.790
I kept a cool head.

504
00:32:28.373 --> 00:32:29.623
You're a lost cause.

505
00:32:30.207 --> 00:32:33.410
Don't get in a huff.
I'll take you for a spin.


506
00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.993
This baby's not so bad.

507
00:32:35.123 --> 00:32:37.202
I don't give a shit about your car!

508
00:32:37.332 --> 00:32:38.998
Do you think I'm impressed?

509
00:32:39.582 --> 00:32:41.957
Besides, alloy wheels are for hicks!

510
00:32:54.665 --> 00:32:57.873
I need you to punch my train ticket

511
00:33:04.707 --> 00:33:06.707
Do you feel it?

512
00:33:07.665 --> 00:33:08.665
What?

513
00:33:09.998 --> 00:33:10.998
Take this!

514
00:33:18.415 --> 00:33:19.415
Are you ok?

515
00:33:25.248 --> 00:33:26.832
We're not done.

516
00:33:34.498 --> 00:33:35.998
That's going too far.

517
00:33:39.248 --> 00:33:40.290
What the hell?

518
00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.743
- What?
- What was that?


519
00:33:43.873 --> 00:33:46.035
Rocco, my cat.

520
00:33:46.165 --> 00:33:48.410
He doesn't like people in my bed.

521
00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.243
Can you leave, please?

522
00:33:50.373 --> 00:33:52.373
Ouch, that hurts!

523
00:33:58.957 --> 00:34:00.415
You were wild today.

524
00:34:07.748 --> 00:34:09.373
Back among the living?

525
00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:15.665
That's too much.

526
00:34:16.165 --> 00:34:17.498
You're worth it.

527
00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:20.910
- Did you get your advance?
- Soon.


528
00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.498
Big shot.

529
00:34:22.665 --> 00:34:25.118
How can you spend what you don't have?

530
00:34:25.248 --> 00:34:27.373
I borrow, here and there.

531
00:34:28.498 --> 00:34:32.373
Watch out, one day
you'll get your face smashed in.


532
00:34:32.915 --> 00:34:34.748
Shall I order take-out?

533
00:34:35.998 --> 00:34:36.998
No.

534
00:34:39.457 --> 00:34:41.082
A client's waiting.

535
00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.452
Don't forget this.

536
00:34:43.582 --> 00:34:45.160
It's not mine.

537
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:47.498
I don't leave my toothbrush here.

538
00:35:49.748 --> 00:35:53.373
Annabelle fucked all of Paris
without any pleasure.


539
00:35:56.915 --> 00:35:59.748
Annabelle fucked all of Paris.

540
00:37:11.248 --> 00:37:13.373
I'M NOT AN EASY MAN

541
00:37:18.957 --> 00:37:20.993
Not sure it's my thing.

542
00:37:21.123 --> 00:37:21.952
Me neither.

543
00:37:22.082 --> 00:37:25.952
When Lolo talked about Tits for Tat,
I thought it was a sex shop.


544
00:37:26.082 --> 00:37:27.665
TITS FOR TAT!

545
00:37:30.207 --> 00:37:33.082
Good morning! I'm Christophe.

546
00:37:33.248 --> 00:37:37.415
There's as much sexism
in young start-ups as anywhere else.


547
00:37:37.707 --> 00:37:40.035
It's more ambiguous and subtle

548
00:37:40.165 --> 00:37:42.410
but sadly, I've heard it all before.

549
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.540
We'll do what we can for you.

550
00:37:44.832 --> 00:37:47.748
But Tits for Tat
is really an action group.


551
00:37:48.457 --> 00:37:51.535
We wear our boobs
at female-dominated events.


552
00:37:51.665 --> 00:37:53.915
Board meetings, the Medical Association,

553
00:37:54.123 --> 00:37:56.202
festivals. And we act like them.

554
00:37:56.332 --> 00:37:58.165
The more the merrier.

555
00:37:58.332 --> 00:38:00.868
It's an exchange. Like sex.

556
00:38:00.998 --> 00:38:02.457
I see.

557
00:38:03.165 --> 00:38:04.207
Give and take.

558
00:38:05.582 --> 00:38:07.957
There's three of us. Two plus one.

559
00:38:08.873 --> 00:38:10.082
She's the future too.

560
00:38:10.832 --> 00:38:12.165
That's sweet.

561
00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.368
Yep.

562
00:38:15.498 --> 00:38:16.540
<i>My shoulders?</i>

563
00:38:20.123 --> 00:38:21.332
<i>Do you like them?</i>

564
00:38:23.373 --> 00:38:24.373
<i>Yes.</i>

565
00:38:27.082 --> 00:38:28.748
<i>They aren't round enough.</i>

566
00:38:31.165 --> 00:38:33.660
I'm not sure where the bowl goes!

567
00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:36.457
- I'll leave it out!
- Thanks, Dad.


568
00:38:37.582 --> 00:38:41.035
It was nice to have us over.

569
00:38:41.165 --> 00:38:43.665
You must have better things to do.

570
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.873
Maybe I'm a little psychic.

571
00:38:49.665 --> 00:38:52.327
See who it is, don't mind us.

572
00:38:52.457 --> 00:38:54.540
Maybe a girl asking you out.

573
00:38:56.082 --> 00:38:59.582
You need to get out there
to meet your soulmate.


574
00:39:00.832 --> 00:39:02.498
Aren't you seeing anyone?

575
00:39:06.873 --> 00:39:09.665
<i>And my nipples? 
Do you like them?</i>

576
00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:13.623
You never introduce us to anyone.

577
00:39:14.623 --> 00:39:15.915
I don't get it.

578
00:39:16.707 --> 00:39:19.077
You're adorable, you look young,

579
00:39:19.207 --> 00:39:22.082
you don't plan to
just live with your cat.

580
00:39:22.373 --> 00:39:23.493
There must be one woman...

581
00:39:23.623 --> 00:39:25.368
What don't you get?

582
00:39:25.498 --> 00:39:29.160
There's not one woman, there are 3,000!

583
00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:31.702
I use more condoms than anyone in Paris,

584
00:39:31.832 --> 00:39:34.660
in case you're worried.
You've never met anyone


585
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:37.665
because I can't even remember their names!

586
00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:41.118
"11 p.m. at the Normandy hotel bar."

587
00:39:41.248 --> 00:39:43.077
I don't even know who she is!

588
00:39:43.207 --> 00:39:45.368
I churn 'em out like sausages!

589
00:39:45.498 --> 00:39:49.582
What's the big fucking deal
about being a single man?


590
00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:53.082
It takes time to make good sausages.

591
00:39:59.457 --> 00:40:00.285
Bar, please?

592
00:40:00.415 --> 00:40:01.790
In the back.

593
00:40:10.707 --> 00:40:12.410
Lumberjane's back.

594
00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.202
- I saw him.
- Not bad, but...


595
00:40:15.332 --> 00:40:17.082
He made it!

596
00:40:19.248 --> 00:40:20.993
Yesterday wasn't enough?

597
00:40:21.123 --> 00:40:22.790
Wasn't I clear?

598
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.660
You made yourself very clear,

599
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:28.743
and I don't intend
to offer you work again.


600
00:40:28.873 --> 00:40:29.873
Champagne?

601
00:40:30.832 --> 00:40:32.082
Brut or rosé?

602
00:40:32.457 --> 00:40:35.248
Gentlemen prefer rosé.

603
00:40:35.707 --> 00:40:36.707
Brut.

604
00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:41.415
Same.

605
00:40:42.957 --> 00:40:44.957
What do you call
champagne and orange juice?


606
00:40:47.415 --> 00:40:48.665
A mimosa.

607
00:40:52.873 --> 00:40:55.707
I thought about your alternate world.

608
00:40:56.248 --> 00:40:58.040
It got me thinking.

609
00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.540
Did it?

610
00:41:00.957 --> 00:41:03.202
It's not so bad
for women in your world.

611
00:41:03.332 --> 00:41:04.827
They get gifts,

612
00:41:04.957 --> 00:41:06.202
doors are held open.

613
00:41:06.332 --> 00:41:07.332
You're kidding.

614
00:41:07.415 --> 00:41:08.498
No, why?

615
00:41:09.873 --> 00:41:12.290
Of course, you wouldn't know.

616
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:15.993
You were so manly before,
now you're like a girl.


617
00:41:16.123 --> 00:41:17.535
I forgot my garter belt.

618
00:41:17.665 --> 00:41:19.827
Do you ever stop? 
It must be exhausting.

619
00:41:19.957 --> 00:41:21.743
Do you ever forget you're a woman?

620
00:41:21.873 --> 00:41:24.165
- I'm not obsessed with it.
- Liar.


621
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:28.540
When you wake up, piss, shower,
do your boxing,


622
00:41:29.165 --> 00:41:32.207
when you sign books for your fans,

623
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:34.957
when you ogle a guy in the street,

624
00:41:35.165 --> 00:41:38.040
his legs, his neck, his ass,

625
00:41:38.873 --> 00:41:41.082
when you bed him, make him come,

626
00:41:42.457 --> 00:41:44.623
do you forget who does all that?

627
00:41:48.415 --> 00:41:51.118
Feminine psychology
isn't your strong point.


628
00:41:51.248 --> 00:41:52.832
We're the same, Alexandra.

629
00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:55.790
I make dates in hotel bars too.

630
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:58.373
Are the rooms comfy?

631
00:42:03.957 --> 00:42:04.957
So then,

632
00:42:05.832 --> 00:42:08.493
if I understand, in your world,

633
00:42:08.623 --> 00:42:11.790
women fight to split the housework?

634
00:42:12.998 --> 00:42:15.873
What's a male condom like?
Small and tight?


635
00:42:16.082 --> 00:42:18.707
Very easy to put on. Wanna see?

636
00:42:19.082 --> 00:42:22.702
The female ones
have never caught on for us.


637
00:42:22.832 --> 00:42:26.873
Did they repave the road
after your UFO landed?


638
00:42:27.248 --> 00:42:29.915
You think I'm drunk? I am.

639
00:42:30.873 --> 00:42:33.582
But if you tease me, I'll shut up.

640
00:42:33.832 --> 00:42:37.285
You make me feel alive.
I could listen to you for hours.


641
00:42:37.415 --> 00:42:38.452
Really?

642
00:42:38.582 --> 00:42:39.618
What?

643
00:42:39.748 --> 00:42:41.290
- Can't I kiss you?
- No.


644
00:42:41.915 --> 00:42:45.285
You're going to take a nice cab home.

645
00:42:45.415 --> 00:42:46.790
Don't you like me?

646
00:42:48.457 --> 00:42:50.118
You're delightful,

647
00:42:50.248 --> 00:42:52.743
but I never take
advantage of a drunk boy.

648
00:42:52.873 --> 00:42:54.915
What's that? Gallantry?

649
00:42:55.582 --> 00:42:58.535
Call it what you like: manners, courtesy.

650
00:42:58.665 --> 00:43:00.248
You'll thank me tomorrow.

651
00:43:00.665 --> 00:43:04.290
Don't you get it? 
No kiss, your miss.

652
00:43:06.123 --> 00:43:08.118
- Come on.
- Don't be a prude.


653
00:43:08.248 --> 00:43:10.248
You're gorgeous and you know it.

654
00:43:10.873 --> 00:43:12.707
Next time, no whisky for you.

655
00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:17.160
There is no next time. 
Didn't you hear me?

656
00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:19.332
Take it or leave it. So?

657
00:43:19.707 --> 00:43:20.868
So goodnight.

658
00:43:20.998 --> 00:43:24.618
Ma'am, make sure
he makes it inside safely.


659
00:43:24.748 --> 00:43:27.702
No, to the Champs
-Elysées, any nightclub!

660
00:43:27.832 --> 00:43:29.452
I don't need a broad like her.

661
00:43:29.582 --> 00:43:31.785
I get all the chicks I want!

662
00:43:31.915 --> 00:43:34.748
Black ones, white ones, young ones...

663
00:43:35.332 --> 00:43:36.868
<i>And they have jobs like...</i>

664
00:43:36.998 --> 00:43:41.285
<i>Cleaning lady, childcare worker,
nurse, secretary...</i>


665
00:43:41.415 --> 00:43:44.582
<i>No way. I couldn't have a woman secretary.</i>

666
00:43:44.832 --> 00:43:47.577
<i>But you could be one, 
Alexandra.</i>

667
00:43:47.707 --> 00:43:49.452
<i>You would work for me!</i>

668
00:43:49.582 --> 00:43:51.790
<i>You wouldn't exist as you are.</i>

669
00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:53.743
<i>And if you didn't...</i>

670
00:43:53.873 --> 00:43:56.623
A masculist. A new conquest for you.

671
00:43:57.498 --> 00:43:59.165
This time it's different.

672
00:44:00.582 --> 00:44:01.873
Damien is my new novel.

673
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:05.993
You haven't written a line
in over three years.


674
00:44:06.123 --> 00:44:08.457
I'd like to show

675
00:44:09.082 --> 00:44:12.207
that these guys aren't that different.

676
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:15.368
What do they dream of? 
Settling down.

677
00:44:15.498 --> 00:44:17.452
They want us to love them,

678
00:44:17.582 --> 00:44:19.915
hold them in our arms, reassure them.

679
00:44:20.498 --> 00:44:22.748
So once I'm under his skin,

680
00:44:23.082 --> 00:44:26.457
however masculist he claims to be,
he'll be trapped.


681
00:44:26.873 --> 00:44:30.243
And when I leave him,
he'll go home crying to daddy.


682
00:44:30.373 --> 00:44:33.165
My book's going to teach him a lesson.

683
00:44:35.332 --> 00:44:37.332
It'll create a huge buzz.

684
00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:40.993
Whatshername had to resign
from government.


685
00:44:41.123 --> 00:44:44.957
Masculist testosterone is raging,
your timing's brash!


686
00:44:45.832 --> 00:44:49.165
I'm going to need an advance.

687
00:44:50.707 --> 00:44:53.790
You're forgetting
you've already gotten so much.


688
00:44:54.457 --> 00:44:57.285
Give me something to read
and I'll fight for you.


689
00:44:57.415 --> 00:44:58.998
Annie, I'm in deep shit.

690
00:45:01.207 --> 00:45:02.623
That'll change.

691
00:45:09.832 --> 00:45:11.743
Sleep well?

692
00:45:11.873 --> 00:45:14.493
I'm inviting you
to a cocktail party tonight.


693
00:45:14.623 --> 00:45:16.540
I want you to meet a friend.

694
00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.165
<i>I'll see what I can do.</i>

695
00:45:20.707 --> 00:45:22.665
Nice idea you had, Damien.

696
00:45:22.957 --> 00:45:24.910
My bouquet will soon wilt,

697
00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:29.040
while your big cactus
will still be standing tall.


698
00:45:45.623 --> 00:45:47.243
I came to see my goddaughter.

699
00:45:47.373 --> 00:45:48.577
She's asleep.

700
00:45:48.707 --> 00:45:52.332
Actually, my brother's going to be
the godfather this time.


701
00:45:54.748 --> 00:45:55.748
Really?

702
00:45:56.665 --> 00:45:58.373
That's your choice.

703
00:45:59.748 --> 00:46:00.790
Can I come in?

704
00:46:01.457 --> 00:46:05.952
I know, I was going to tell you.
I screwed up.


705
00:46:06.082 --> 00:46:09.160
I can't work for her. 
She's hot for me.

706
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:10.748
Do you hear yourself?

707
00:46:11.165 --> 00:46:14.368
- All those nights of whining.
- Me?


708
00:46:14.498 --> 00:46:17.368
Suddenly you're the best lay in town?

709
00:46:17.498 --> 00:46:18.998
Sorry, it's pathetic.

710
00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:20.415
What about Sibyl?

711
00:46:20.582 --> 00:46:23.373
You know your problem? 
You're uptight.

712
00:46:25.082 --> 00:46:26.785
From you, that's a compliment.

713
00:46:26.915 --> 00:46:30.577
You're uptight and complacent
in your little life.


714
00:46:30.707 --> 00:46:33.623
You don't see how your wife treats you.

715
00:46:34.373 --> 00:46:35.410
You accept everything.

716
00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:38.660
And you, nothing.
So you're jobless and live with a cat!


717
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:40.290
What's the deal with my cat?

718
00:46:42.915 --> 00:46:44.910
Life is full of compromises.

719
00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.493
What if I don't get my job back?

720
00:46:47.623 --> 00:46:49.123
You can start a cupcake blog.

721
00:46:52.623 --> 00:46:53.873
That's mean.

722
00:46:55.082 --> 00:46:57.540
I'm telling you this because I love you.

723
00:46:57.957 --> 00:46:59.785
Can't you understand that?

724
00:46:59.915 --> 00:47:03.160
Things were great with Alexandra
till you came along.


725
00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:04.577
She's sweet with me.

726
00:47:04.707 --> 00:47:06.248
Know what she calls you?

727
00:47:07.248 --> 00:47:08.077
Fat Ass.

728
00:47:08.207 --> 00:47:09.207
Sweet, isn't it?

729
00:47:09.248 --> 00:47:11.832
Get out. I never
want to see you again.

730
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:13.873
Good.

731
00:47:14.832 --> 00:47:16.498
You freak me out.

732
00:47:24.457 --> 00:47:25.665
What do you think?

733
00:47:27.623 --> 00:47:28.623
You're right.

734
00:47:34.873 --> 00:47:35.998
Yeah.

735
00:47:48.873 --> 00:47:49.952
Seattle last week,

736
00:47:50.082 --> 00:47:53.493
next week Marseille. 
It never ends.

737
00:47:53.623 --> 00:47:55.035
Your husband's radiant!

738
00:47:55.165 --> 00:47:58.577
Thanks! I never get compliments.
Thank goodness for you.


739
00:47:58.707 --> 00:48:00.540
The complaints office is shut.

740
00:48:01.623 --> 00:48:03.707
Alexandra. Have you met before?

741
00:48:04.998 --> 00:48:06.123
Hi there.

742
00:48:07.623 --> 00:48:10.285
Alexandra Lamour, Brigitte Magre.
Her husband.


743
00:48:10.415 --> 00:48:12.077
My husband's one of your biggest fans.

744
00:48:12.207 --> 00:48:13.207
Good evening.

745
00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:15.952
- Your books are my escape.
- Thanks.


746
00:48:16.082 --> 00:48:18.660
She's writing a controversial new book.

747
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:20.832
Fun! What's it about?

748
00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:24.493
She's tackling
the myth of female domination.


749
00:48:24.623 --> 00:48:26.123
Wouldn't you say?

750
00:48:28.082 --> 00:48:29.082
Excuse me.

751
00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:30.290
That's him.

752
00:48:31.415 --> 00:48:33.160
But he's over 26.

753
00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:35.785
I'm not courting him.
Damien is my subject.


754
00:48:35.915 --> 00:48:37.077
I get it.

755
00:48:37.207 --> 00:48:39.082
- How's Jean-Pierre?
- Fine, as usual.


756
00:48:39.623 --> 00:48:41.957
- Evening.
- Good evening, Damien.


757
00:48:42.623 --> 00:48:45.160
Annie Meyer, the publisher.
May I kiss you?


758
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:48.248
I never miss a chance
to kiss a pretty man.


759
00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:53.707
I'd like a drink. Would you?

760
00:48:54.332 --> 00:48:55.332
I'll get it.

761
00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:02.207
I've heard the male cause
is your hobbyhorse.


762
00:49:02.498 --> 00:49:05.290
When's the revolution?
Will we lose our heads?


763
00:49:06.748 --> 00:49:07.827
I'm not at war.

764
00:49:07.957 --> 00:49:09.327
What do you want, then?

765
00:49:09.457 --> 00:49:11.873
Besides wearing a suit.

766
00:49:13.957 --> 00:49:15.493
Boxer shorts for men.

767
00:49:15.623 --> 00:49:16.832
Ever worn a G-string?

768
00:49:17.165 --> 00:49:18.790
That's true injustice.

769
00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:22.748
But you can't realize
if you haven't been there.


770
00:49:23.415 --> 00:49:24.952
What bothers you?

771
00:49:25.082 --> 00:49:28.327
Getting compliments,
having drinks brought to you?


772
00:49:28.457 --> 00:49:29.957
It doesn't make sense.

773
00:49:31.498 --> 00:49:33.123
Long live masculinity!

774
00:49:39.873 --> 00:49:41.915
I'm homesick, Alexandra.

775
00:49:42.832 --> 00:49:44.082
I want to see skirts.

776
00:49:44.998 --> 00:49:47.660
Legs, thighs, stiletto heels,

777
00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:50.743
fishnet stockings, little lace panties.

778
00:49:50.873 --> 00:49:54.498
On the other hand,
purses are quite convenient.


779
00:49:55.415 --> 00:49:56.665
Allow me.

780
00:49:58.415 --> 00:50:00.207
If you knew how lovely

781
00:50:00.665 --> 00:50:03.582
woman's cleavage looks in a push-up bra.

782
00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.665
How come you like that?

783
00:50:09.707 --> 00:50:11.415
A woman walking,

784
00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:16.248
her stockings swishing softly

785
00:50:16.498 --> 00:50:19.248
against her raincoat at each step.

786
00:50:21.707 --> 00:50:23.207
A strap snapping.

787
00:50:24.998 --> 00:50:26.332
A zipper unzipping.

788
00:50:28.498 --> 00:50:30.165
I can manage that.

789
00:50:30.748 --> 00:50:31.748
Come on.

790
00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:33.790
I said come on.

791
00:50:39.123 --> 00:50:41.618
RV like "rendezvous"?

792
00:50:41.748 --> 00:50:43.202
No, like "reverse".

793
00:50:43.332 --> 00:50:44.707
Good evening.

794
00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:14.498
This is heaven!

795
00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:18.332
You're gay!

796
00:53:18.832 --> 00:53:19.832
What?

797
00:53:20.707 --> 00:53:22.577
You're gay, right?

798
00:53:22.707 --> 00:53:24.457
Not at all!

799
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:28.952
Yes you are, it's obvious.
Like lots of people here.


800
00:53:29.082 --> 00:53:30.290
Relax!

801
00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:16.035
Physical superiority,

802
00:54:16.165 --> 00:54:19.040
you can't deny it, it's nature.

803
00:54:21.373 --> 00:54:26.082
In my world,
prehistoric men starved women,


804
00:54:27.582 --> 00:54:29.957
who only got scraps from the hunt.

805
00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:32.623
That's what made them frail.

806
00:54:33.623 --> 00:54:35.207
For thousands of years.

807
00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:40.743
In my world, women were stronger

808
00:54:40.873 --> 00:54:43.623
so nature had them bear the children

809
00:54:44.623 --> 00:54:47.160
and go off hunting year-round

810
00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:50.082
while the men looked after the kids.

811
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:55.290
In my world, men do the fighting,

812
00:54:55.832 --> 00:54:58.748
they stand up to each
other and go to war.

813
00:55:03.332 --> 00:55:07.410
In my world, women have the upper hand.
Where do you think you are?


814
00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:08.623
In my bed.

815
00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:11.582
Wait.

816
00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:25.707
Aren't you coming?

817
00:55:36.415 --> 00:55:38.118
You've got a handsome nose.

818
00:55:38.248 --> 00:55:39.665
Kiss me.

819
00:55:59.165 --> 00:56:00.498
What are you doing?

820
00:56:02.207 --> 00:56:03.415
I have to go.

821
00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:06.707
I have a poker game.

822
00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:10.040
Don't lie to me.

823
00:56:12.165 --> 00:56:13.332
Go back to sleep.

824
00:56:23.498 --> 00:56:24.748
I like you.

825
00:56:26.832 --> 00:56:28.498
I like you too.

826
00:56:29.123 --> 00:56:30.618
But I'm not a good person.

827
00:56:30.748 --> 00:56:31.957
Me neither.

828
00:56:32.457 --> 00:56:35.790
I might disappear and never call you.

829
00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:38.665
Try it.

830
00:56:52.207 --> 00:56:55.582
SOW

831
00:57:01.165 --> 00:57:02.165
Farther.

832
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.707
Look up high.

833
00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:08.290
Open, now cross your arms.

834
00:57:09.998 --> 00:57:11.373
More.

835
00:57:13.582 --> 00:57:14.582
That's it.

836
00:57:14.623 --> 00:57:15.623
<i>En dehors.</i>

837
00:57:18.457 --> 00:57:21.540
And one, two, three.

838
00:57:22.957 --> 00:57:23.957
<i>Piqué.</i>

839
00:57:24.082 --> 00:57:25.082
Good.

840
00:57:32.082 --> 00:57:33.743
Right. That's nice.

841
00:57:33.873 --> 00:57:35.285
Chocolate mousse, please.

842
00:57:35.415 --> 00:57:36.790
It'll make me fat.

843
00:57:37.373 --> 00:57:38.743
Cut it out!

844
00:57:38.873 --> 00:57:40.665
I watch my figure.

845
00:57:44.165 --> 00:57:47.118
How's your dad?
Did he tell you we had a fight?


846
00:57:47.248 --> 00:57:48.248
Yeah.

847
00:57:48.332 --> 00:57:50.832
I think you should call him.

848
00:57:52.457 --> 00:57:54.832
Thanks for coming today.

849
00:57:58.123 --> 00:57:59.540
What's wrong?

850
00:57:59.832 --> 00:58:03.873
There's this girl at school...

851
00:58:05.123 --> 00:58:07.498
- I'm crazy about her.
- That's great!


852
00:58:07.915 --> 00:58:09.373
Her name's Sarah.

853
00:58:11.082 --> 00:58:12.290
She's beautiful.

854
00:58:13.623 --> 00:58:14.790
The thing is,

855
00:58:15.207 --> 00:58:19.915
I was in the school bathroom
the other day,


856
00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.248
she came in and
asked me to lick her.

857
00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:26.290
I see.

858
00:58:27.998 --> 00:58:29.118
Right.

859
00:58:29.248 --> 00:58:30.290
And I did.

860
00:58:31.998 --> 00:58:33.873
What about you, did she...?

861
00:58:34.582 --> 00:58:36.623
No, she didn't do anything.

862
00:58:36.915 --> 00:58:38.582
She felt me a little.

863
00:58:38.915 --> 00:58:40.457
That was nice of you!

864
00:58:42.165 --> 00:58:44.873
Sam, you did do
it because you wanted to?

865
00:58:45.248 --> 00:58:46.577
Not much choice.

866
00:58:46.707 --> 00:58:48.285
There's always a choice.

867
00:58:48.415 --> 00:58:51.957
A girl can't make you lick her.
It's impossible.


868
00:58:56.373 --> 00:58:59.243
- I don't know what to do.
- Forget about her!


869
00:58:59.373 --> 00:59:02.207
There's no shortage of easy girls!

870
00:59:14.165 --> 00:59:16.743
So soon? I thought you'd never be back.

871
00:59:16.873 --> 00:59:18.998
Pretend I'm not here.

872
00:59:21.748 --> 00:59:24.040
Are you having some trouble?

873
00:59:25.832 --> 00:59:27.373
Bad neighborhood.

874
00:59:30.665 --> 00:59:35.077
Since you're here
I may as well call the painter.


875
00:59:35.207 --> 00:59:38.290
I have to go out,
could you wait for her?

876
00:59:38.873 --> 00:59:39.873
Sure.

877
00:59:40.498 --> 00:59:43.827
If you get bored
you could do some more work.


878
00:59:43.957 --> 00:59:45.452
I can't cope without you.

879
00:59:45.582 --> 00:59:47.540
For free? In your dreams.

880
00:59:48.082 --> 00:59:50.540
- How much?
- Did you win all that?


881
00:59:50.957 --> 00:59:54.327
I owe this, I could give you...

882
00:59:54.457 --> 00:59:55.457
No.

883
00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.660
Would you mind ironing some shirts?

884
01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:03.540
Mr. Martel's watching his nieces
this week.


885
01:00:04.207 --> 01:00:05.873
Don't you know how to iron?

886
01:00:09.790 --> 01:00:10.790
I have an idea.

887
01:00:11.082 --> 01:00:13.452
Let's go out later.
I'll take you shopping.


888
01:00:13.582 --> 01:00:17.790
Sound good?
I can spoil you, I owe you that.


889
01:00:18.165 --> 01:00:19.832
My lucky charm.

890
01:00:32.207 --> 01:00:35.498
<i>Turn the shirt over,
dampen the collar if it's stiff</i>


891
01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:37.707
<i>and iron on the outside.</i>

892
01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:41.290
<i>Do up the top two buttons...</i>

893
01:00:49.457 --> 01:00:51.207
Your language sounds nice.

894
01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:53.540
Thank you.

895
01:00:53.832 --> 01:00:55.202
What's a "sow"?

896
01:00:55.332 --> 01:00:58.660
Actually, it's a female pig.

897
01:00:58.790 --> 01:01:00.040
The boar's mate.

898
01:01:01.707 --> 01:01:04.040
But it's mainly an insult.

899
01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:07.868
It means disgusting,

900
01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:09.285
sex maniac, bitch.

901
01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:10.457
Bitch?

902
01:01:12.248 --> 01:01:13.582
Her, a bitch?

903
01:01:15.457 --> 01:01:16.998
I know that word.

904
01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:21.243
Fatherfucker, ho, cow...

905
01:01:21.373 --> 01:01:23.498
That's it, exactly.

906
01:01:37.082 --> 01:01:38.952
You'll think of me every second.

907
01:01:39.082 --> 01:01:40.873
I can't accept that.

908
01:01:41.123 --> 01:01:42.957
Why not? Don't you like it?

909
01:01:43.623 --> 01:01:45.165
It's nice.

910
01:01:46.165 --> 01:01:47.452
A little thin.

911
01:01:47.582 --> 01:01:50.618
It's masculine.
Big watches look bad on men.


912
01:01:50.748 --> 01:01:52.910
I prefer a bigger one.

913
01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.373
You really are different.

914
01:01:54.582 --> 01:01:55.623
Let's go.

915
01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.452
Lovers in Paris are like tourists,

916
01:02:06.582 --> 01:02:07.665
aren't they?

917
01:02:08.998 --> 01:02:10.498
- Who in Paris?
- What?


918
01:02:10.998 --> 01:02:12.207
What did I say?

919
01:02:13.123 --> 01:02:16.332
People like us in Paris...

920
01:02:21.165 --> 01:02:21.993
Let's go.

921
01:02:22.123 --> 01:02:23.910
Stop, you keep running away.

922
01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.498
- No, I don't.
- Yes.


923
01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.165
I'm here.

924
01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.248
I'm here.

925
01:02:49.415 --> 01:02:50.540
Christophe!

926
01:02:54.707 --> 01:02:57.373
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

927
01:02:58.665 --> 01:03:02.123
Please say something.
Quit being all huffy.


928
01:03:03.623 --> 01:03:04.873
Forgive me.

929
01:03:05.123 --> 01:03:08.498
Say, "Would you please forgive me."

930
01:03:08.707 --> 01:03:10.452
You're such a pain!

931
01:03:10.582 --> 01:03:14.077
Usually I do whatever I can
to get rid of women


932
01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:15.415
but with her,

933
01:03:15.623 --> 01:03:17.707
I'm afraid she'll disappear.

934
01:03:18.707 --> 01:03:19.707
You're in love.

935
01:03:19.790 --> 01:03:20.790
No!

936
01:03:23.165 --> 01:03:24.873
It'll end bad anyway.

937
01:03:25.832 --> 01:03:26.702
How so?

938
01:03:26.832 --> 01:03:29.707
You'll either split up
or one of you will die.


939
01:03:30.915 --> 01:03:32.623
Enjoy it while you can.

940
01:03:33.707 --> 01:03:34.873
Are you alright?

941
01:03:35.665 --> 01:03:37.040
Lolo's cheating on me.

942
01:03:37.582 --> 01:03:38.582
Really?

943
01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:42.540
I found a hotel receipt in her pocket.

944
01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.873
Did you ask her?

945
01:03:45.665 --> 01:03:46.790
She denied it.

946
01:03:47.915 --> 01:03:49.832
Then maybe it's nothing.

947
01:03:53.332 --> 01:03:55.915
This fat cuckold isn't done yet.

948
01:03:56.457 --> 01:03:59.207
I'm gonna send the little asshole packing.

949
01:04:11.332 --> 01:04:13.248
Do you have to work today?

950
01:04:14.498 --> 01:04:16.165
Where do you go to write?

951
01:04:16.332 --> 01:04:17.457
Depends.

952
01:04:18.207 --> 01:04:19.623
Can I read it one day?

953
01:04:20.665 --> 01:04:22.123
What are your plans?

954
01:04:22.998 --> 01:04:25.452
I have a job interview in a bar.

955
01:04:25.582 --> 01:04:27.077
That's dumb.

956
01:04:27.207 --> 01:04:28.498
It's just temporary.

957
01:04:29.415 --> 01:04:31.248
I'd pay you twice as much.

958
01:04:31.748 --> 01:04:36.082
I don't want to depend on you
or be at your command.


959
01:04:38.998 --> 01:04:41.993
What's this outdated masculist drivel?

960
01:04:42.123 --> 01:04:44.618
Not masculist. 
I want to be your equal.

961
01:04:44.748 --> 01:04:46.915
- That's stupid!
- Why?


962
01:04:47.165 --> 01:04:49.707
- It's absurd.
- Maybe it is masculism.


963
01:04:49.915 --> 01:04:52.493
- Fine, I'm a masculist!
- Ridiculous.


964
01:04:52.623 --> 01:04:53.952
Why are you upset?

965
01:04:54.082 --> 01:04:56.498
I want to give us a chance.

966
01:04:59.457 --> 01:05:01.832
I'm not sure I can
give you what you want.

967
01:05:03.873 --> 01:05:06.290
Me neither, for what it's worth.

968
01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.040
We're on the same wavelength.

969
01:05:12.457 --> 01:05:13.498
That's rare.

970
01:05:33.957 --> 01:05:34.998
Hello.

971
01:05:36.457 --> 01:05:37.660
Is Alexandra in?

972
01:05:37.790 --> 01:05:39.623
No, was she expecting you?

973
01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:41.118
Who are you?

974
01:05:41.248 --> 01:05:43.702
Damien. Alexandra's friend.

975
01:05:43.832 --> 01:05:46.665
Daffodil. I left a ring in the bedroom.

976
01:05:48.623 --> 01:05:51.623
A friend, huh? 
I'll give you friends!

977
01:06:03.957 --> 01:06:05.915
Daffodil's here...

978
01:06:08.748 --> 01:06:10.415
- You ok?
- Yeah!


979
01:06:12.873 --> 01:06:14.707
Call the cops

980
01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.415
What are you doing?

981
01:06:23.832 --> 01:06:24.957
That's irrational.

982
01:06:25.248 --> 01:06:26.415
Irrational?

983
01:06:27.373 --> 01:06:30.332
You know who she is?
A narcissistic pervert!


984
01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:33.410
She collects men like objects.
Is that rational?


985
01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:35.415
Each conquest is a marble!

986
01:06:37.123 --> 01:06:39.582
You saw the witch jars on her shelf.

987
01:06:39.790 --> 01:06:43.332
She compares her performance
from year to year.


988
01:06:44.373 --> 01:06:47.540
Look at your face. 
Who's the fool now?

989
01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:50.373
We're in the same boat, pal.

990
01:06:56.207 --> 01:06:58.082
She made me feel intelligent.

991
01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:00.832
Important, since she chose me.

992
01:07:01.498 --> 01:07:03.332
How could I be so stupid?

993
01:07:06.873 --> 01:07:08.165
Look at me now.

994
01:07:08.832 --> 01:07:10.410
I'm nothing anymore.

995
01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:13.082
Look what she's done to me.

996
01:07:16.332 --> 01:07:19.332
Stay away from me! 
Who knows what I'll do!

997
01:07:22.582 --> 01:07:23.868
TINY TITS

998
01:07:23.998 --> 01:07:25.452
Who is he?

999
01:07:25.582 --> 01:07:27.623
Nobody. Nothing.

1000
01:07:30.373 --> 01:07:32.248
You shouldn't let people in.

1001
01:07:32.582 --> 01:07:35.498
I owe money all over,
tons of women are after me.


1002
01:07:37.123 --> 01:07:39.915
One was waiting downstairs
the other night.


1003
01:07:40.582 --> 01:07:42.202
I kicked her ass.

1004
01:07:42.332 --> 01:07:44.415
- What's this about?
- What?


1005
01:07:46.082 --> 01:07:47.415
The jars on the shelf.

1006
01:07:48.498 --> 01:07:51.452
- You snooped?
- Is each marble a lay?


1007
01:07:51.582 --> 01:07:53.077
- That guy's sick.
- Answer me!


1008
01:07:53.207 --> 01:07:55.415
- Don't make a scene.
- Am I in there?


1009
01:07:56.498 --> 01:07:58.457
Am I a peewee or a shooter?

1010
01:07:59.123 --> 01:08:02.952
You think you can flick me away
anytime you like?


1011
01:08:03.082 --> 01:08:04.827
I don't get your reaction.

1012
01:08:04.957 --> 01:08:06.290
But you're so smart.

1013
01:08:06.707 --> 01:08:09.040
Did you think I was a virgin?

1014
01:08:09.415 --> 01:08:10.702
That you were my first?

1015
01:08:10.832 --> 01:08:13.327
You're no better, I hear.

1016
01:08:13.457 --> 01:08:14.743
What does that mean?

1017
01:08:14.873 --> 01:08:16.998
You've no right to be offended.

1018
01:08:18.457 --> 01:08:19.582
I get it.

1019
01:08:20.415 --> 01:08:22.332
I have to behave, but you...

1020
01:08:22.748 --> 01:08:24.082
Why change?

1021
01:08:24.748 --> 01:08:27.248
I was wrong when I
said we were the same.

1022
01:08:27.873 --> 01:08:28.952
Have fun.

1023
01:08:29.082 --> 01:08:30.082
Wait.

1024
01:08:33.915 --> 01:08:35.415
I don't want to play anymore.

1025
01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.790
I feel grown-up with you.

1026
01:08:40.582 --> 01:08:42.327
That line won't work.

1027
01:08:42.457 --> 01:08:44.082
I've used it too many times.

1028
01:09:15.165 --> 01:09:17.207
That's a big sandwich!

1029
01:09:19.748 --> 01:09:20.915
Want it?

1030
01:09:21.207 --> 01:09:24.082
It's just ham,
nothing to get all wet about.


1031
01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.827
Here, you can have it!

1032
01:09:26.957 --> 01:09:28.540
What? Come back.

1033
01:09:28.873 --> 01:09:30.582
You were talking. Come back!

1034
01:09:37.790 --> 01:09:38.618
Thank you.

1035
01:09:38.748 --> 01:09:40.248
I've become a victim.

1036
01:09:41.248 --> 01:09:42.743
What were you before?

1037
01:09:42.873 --> 01:09:43.915
An oppressor.

1038
01:09:44.623 --> 01:09:46.457
Maybe there's another way?

1039
01:09:47.165 --> 01:09:49.832
A world where men and women
help each other.


1040
01:09:49.998 --> 01:09:52.457
We work well together, right?

1041
01:09:53.915 --> 01:09:55.118
How are your teeth?

1042
01:09:55.248 --> 01:09:56.415
Better.

1043
01:10:01.748 --> 01:10:02.748
Left, right.

1044
01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:04.957
Left hook. Uppercut.

1045
01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:11.457
Move back.

1046
01:10:11.957 --> 01:10:13.868
If you're too close, no defense.

1047
01:10:13.998 --> 01:10:15.493
Step back to attack.

1048
01:10:15.623 --> 01:10:17.165
I need to hit something.

1049
01:10:20.998 --> 01:10:21.998
Gently!

1050
01:10:22.082 --> 01:10:24.077
Take it out on the bag.

1051
01:10:24.207 --> 01:10:25.290
You bet.

1052
01:10:26.873 --> 01:10:29.660
<i>Isn't the Immaculate Conception
absolute power?</i>


1053
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:33.540
<i>We've got the Virgin Mary too
but Jesus is the hero.</i>


1054
01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:35.707
<i>I like that beauty spot.</i>

1055
01:10:36.082 --> 01:10:37.082
<i>I like you.</i>

1056
01:10:37.123 --> 01:10:40.415
<i>I like you too, but
I'm not a good person.</i>

1057
01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.827
I can't wait to read the rest!

1058
01:11:11.957 --> 01:11:14.748
It's harsh, she's going to destroy him.

1059
01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:18.582
- Really?
- He hasn't got a clue.


1060
01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:21.368
Such a delight!

1061
01:11:21.498 --> 01:11:22.748
I'm not real sure.

1062
01:11:24.415 --> 01:11:29.327
I don't know if it's that relevant,
intellectually speaking.


1063
01:11:29.457 --> 01:11:31.790
It's amazing! As cruel as can be.

1064
01:11:31.998 --> 01:11:35.202
I wonder if I'm not getting off track.

1065
01:11:35.332 --> 01:11:37.243
There's more to life than men.

1066
01:11:37.373 --> 01:11:39.790
Who cares about masculists anyway?

1067
01:11:40.957 --> 01:11:42.498
- Here you go.
- Thanks.


1068
01:11:42.832 --> 01:11:45.873
I could write about a Taliban headwoman,

1069
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:50.827
or a new mafia godmother
in Mexico or Ecuador.


1070
01:11:50.957 --> 01:11:54.035
Or maybe a pedophile priestess instead.

1071
01:11:54.165 --> 01:11:56.915
Anything but a cheap romance!

1072
01:11:57.332 --> 01:11:59.498
Are you falling into your own trap?

1073
01:12:00.123 --> 01:12:02.368
Good intentions don't make great books.

1074
01:12:02.498 --> 01:12:05.952
Think about your career.
You've always been a winner.


1075
01:12:06.082 --> 01:12:09.910
There'll be a lot of media hype,
don't ruin it for a guy.


1076
01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.248
An author must think with her brain.

1077
01:12:13.415 --> 01:12:15.285
There's a check waiting for you.

1078
01:12:15.415 --> 01:12:18.957
You can pick it up or not.
It's your choice.


1079
01:12:20.082 --> 01:12:21.082
Right?

1080
01:12:21.915 --> 01:12:23.540
- This game sucks.
- Fifty.


1081
01:12:23.873 --> 01:12:26.248
- What would you like?
- Your ass, on my lap.


1082
01:12:27.165 --> 01:12:27.993
Classy!

1083
01:12:28.123 --> 01:12:29.160
Steph!

1084
01:12:29.290 --> 01:12:30.457
Excuse her.

1085
01:12:30.998 --> 01:12:32.535
Bourbon, like the ladies.

1086
01:12:32.665 --> 01:12:34.957
Some ice too, please, Anis.

1087
01:12:37.998 --> 01:12:39.827
Who is Anis exactly?

1088
01:12:39.957 --> 01:12:40.957
Anus!

1089
01:12:40.998 --> 01:12:41.998
Anis!

1090
01:12:42.665 --> 01:12:43.957
You're gross!

1091
01:12:44.207 --> 01:12:46.785
He's been working here a couple weeks.

1092
01:12:46.915 --> 01:12:48.457
Not only is he lovely,

1093
01:12:48.748 --> 01:12:50.123
he's got brains too.

1094
01:12:50.665 --> 01:12:51.493
Shit!

1095
01:12:51.623 --> 01:12:53.748
I popped his poker cherry.

1096
01:12:56.082 --> 01:12:57.498
I fold.

1097
01:12:59.623 --> 01:13:00.702
All in.

1098
01:13:00.832 --> 01:13:02.123
250.

1099
01:13:03.082 --> 01:13:04.165
Fold.

1100
01:13:07.415 --> 01:13:08.623
I'll see you.

1101
01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:11.623
Pair of kings.

1102
01:13:13.707 --> 01:13:14.748
Pair of queens.

1103
01:13:18.123 --> 01:13:19.623
Lucky at cards...

1104
01:13:40.498 --> 01:13:41.540
It's me.

1105
01:13:44.165 --> 01:13:45.165
Yes.

1106
01:13:45.707 --> 01:13:47.498
I know, I'm late.

1107
01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:50.540
I'm not coming.

1108
01:13:50.707 --> 01:13:51.748
What?

1109
01:13:52.873 --> 01:13:55.123
I wanted to tell you it's over.

1110
01:13:56.998 --> 01:13:58.535
With you, Annie.

1111
01:13:58.665 --> 01:14:00.952
I'm through with your book,
your media hype.


1112
01:14:01.082 --> 01:14:03.415
<i>What are you saying? 
Are you drunk?</i>

1113
01:14:03.582 --> 01:14:04.582
<i>You're nuts!</i>

1114
01:14:04.665 --> 01:14:05.790
Fuck you.

1115
01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.748
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

1116
01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:15.207
<i>So you love all of me?</i>

1117
01:14:16.748 --> 01:14:17.748
<i>Yes.</i>

1118
01:14:19.207 --> 01:14:20.832
<i>I love all of you,</i>

1119
01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:22.540
<i>tenderly,</i>

1120
01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:24.707
<i>tragically.</i>

1121
01:14:27.457 --> 01:14:28.457
<i>Me too.</i>

1122
01:14:43.623 --> 01:14:44.873
It's Lolo.

1123
01:14:48.165 --> 01:14:49.165
How are you?

1124
01:14:49.207 --> 01:14:51.082
Fine, and you?

1125
01:14:51.957 --> 01:14:53.952
Things are complicated.

1126
01:14:54.082 --> 01:14:55.993
Christophe kicked me out.

1127
01:14:56.123 --> 01:14:57.785
He did? What's going on?

1128
01:14:57.915 --> 01:14:59.082
Can I come in?

1129
01:15:00.915 --> 01:15:02.248
Got a beer?

1130
01:15:02.707 --> 01:15:03.707
Always do.

1131
01:15:03.748 --> 01:15:05.207
- Have one with me?
- Sure.


1132
01:15:09.457 --> 01:15:11.123
Classy kimono.

1133
01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.707
You screwed up, Lolo.

1134
01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:17.623
I swear I didn't.

1135
01:15:18.165 --> 01:15:20.582
- Christophe made it all up.
- Not with me.


1136
01:15:21.373 --> 01:15:23.915
Why would I lie to you?

1137
01:15:27.665 --> 01:15:28.868
I did slip up.

1138
01:15:28.998 --> 01:15:30.165
There.

1139
01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.582
I was pregnant, hormones raging.

1140
01:15:34.332 --> 01:15:35.410
I lost control.

1141
01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:37.998
You gotta call him, talk to him.

1142
01:15:39.665 --> 01:15:40.832
Please.

1143
01:15:45.748 --> 01:15:47.165
It's tough.

1144
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:51.290
Why didn't it work out, you and me?

1145
01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:53.957
No reason. It was cool.

1146
01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.248
We were good in bed, weren't we?

1147
01:15:59.373 --> 01:16:00.748
Yeah, it was cool.

1148
01:16:04.207 --> 01:16:05.415
But I was scared.

1149
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:08.790
Of what?

1150
01:16:08.998 --> 01:16:11.665
You. I was intimidated by you.

1151
01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:15.207
- You knew what you wanted.
- Did I?


1152
01:16:17.415 --> 01:16:19.665
Men are so much more mature.

1153
01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:26.582
We women could go for years
making booty calls.


1154
01:16:26.873 --> 01:16:28.290
But you're not scared.

1155
01:16:29.207 --> 01:16:31.915
Not afraid to say
you're the love of my life.


1156
01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:33.915
I've never said that.

1157
01:16:36.415 --> 01:16:37.832
Not you.

1158
01:16:39.373 --> 01:16:42.457
When we met,
Christophe slid a card under my door.


1159
01:16:42.665 --> 01:16:45.832
That Magritte painting,
<i>This is not a pipe</i>.


1160
01:16:47.832 --> 01:16:52.040
On the back he'd written
"This is not a love letter."


1161
01:16:54.748 --> 01:16:56.457
How can you resist that?

1162
01:17:54.207 --> 01:17:56.790
I booked a room, Mr. and Mrs. Lamour.

1163
01:18:05.748 --> 01:18:06.748
They're off!

1164
01:19:26.915 --> 01:19:28.415
There's a noise.

1165
01:19:29.957 --> 01:19:31.248
I'll pull over.

1166
01:20:01.623 --> 01:20:02.873
Want me to do it?

1167
01:20:12.498 --> 01:20:13.915
Do you buy all that?

1168
01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:17.540
Yes.

1169
01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:20.748
I believe in God.

1170
01:20:21.832 --> 01:20:22.873
She's good to me.

1171
01:20:23.623 --> 01:20:25.577
You believe in sin and Hell?

1172
01:20:25.707 --> 01:20:27.160
- No.
- Go to confession?


1173
01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:28.332
That I do.

1174
01:20:29.123 --> 01:20:32.165
Really? What do you have to say?

1175
01:20:35.123 --> 01:20:36.290
Will you marry me?

1176
01:20:42.082 --> 01:20:45.707
You don't have to answer right away.
Take your time.


1177
01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:48.248
I'm gonna stretch my legs.

1178
01:20:48.998 --> 01:20:50.123
Warm, isn't it?

1179
01:20:50.707 --> 01:20:52.910
Why'd I buy this jacket?

1180
01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.207
Yes.

1181
01:20:54.957 --> 01:20:55.957
What?

1182
01:21:13.332 --> 01:21:17.410
Christophe, your wife is solid.
Good head on her shoulders.


1183
01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:21.202
You're bound to hit some snags
after a few years.


1184
01:21:21.332 --> 01:21:23.207
True, they stray sometimes.

1185
01:21:23.498 --> 01:21:24.993
It's not a big deal.

1186
01:21:25.123 --> 01:21:25.993
Dad.

1187
01:21:26.123 --> 01:21:29.665
When I realized I'd
get a few quiet nights

1188
01:21:30.415 --> 01:21:32.035
I kept my mouth shut.

1189
01:21:32.165 --> 01:21:33.957
Stop it! That's grim.

1190
01:21:34.290 --> 01:21:36.248
Boy talk does a body good.

1191
01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:39.707
Martine's older
and doesn't need it so much.


1192
01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:43.660
But before, she'd get these sudden urges.

1193
01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:46.332
What would happen? 
She'd close the shop

1194
01:21:46.582 --> 01:21:47.873
and we'd do it there.

1195
01:21:49.165 --> 01:21:52.410
She'd have me
right up on the chopping block.


1196
01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:54.165
I had no say in it.

1197
01:21:54.707 --> 01:21:56.832
Sounds crazy but that's how it was.

1198
01:21:57.957 --> 01:21:59.915
I didn't dare say no.

1199
01:22:00.998 --> 01:22:02.832
You did your best, Alain.

1200
01:22:03.498 --> 01:22:04.540
Sure.

1201
01:22:06.498 --> 01:22:07.623
Then again,

1202
01:22:09.123 --> 01:22:12.165
women are little girls without us.

1203
01:22:17.082 --> 01:22:19.165
Here, this is yours.

1204
01:22:19.623 --> 01:22:20.623
You can keep it.

1205
01:22:23.165 --> 01:22:24.165
Dad,

1206
01:22:26.332 --> 01:22:27.707
I met someone.

1207
01:22:34.332 --> 01:22:36.535
Where's your engagement ring?

1208
01:22:36.665 --> 01:22:39.535
The wedding ring itself is a huge step.

1209
01:22:39.665 --> 01:22:41.743
He's come a long way.

1210
01:22:41.873 --> 01:22:42.993
Congratulations.

1211
01:22:43.123 --> 01:22:44.623
Or condolences?

1212
01:22:46.082 --> 01:22:49.493
Before the march,
we'll go by the Collège de France.


1213
01:22:49.623 --> 01:22:50.952
What for?

1214
01:22:51.082 --> 01:22:52.540
They're giving an award.

1215
01:22:53.123 --> 01:22:54.993
The clitocrats are so smug.

1216
01:22:55.123 --> 01:22:57.035
Only three men honored in 44 years.

1217
01:22:57.165 --> 01:22:58.165
Hussies!

1218
01:22:58.290 --> 01:22:59.290
Tarnishing our image!

1219
01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:01.118
What about solidarity?

1220
01:23:01.248 --> 01:23:03.248
Licker! Go back home!

1221
01:23:03.623 --> 01:23:04.702
Pisses me off.

1222
01:23:04.832 --> 01:23:06.415
You're badass!

1223
01:23:10.707 --> 01:23:11.707
Sluts!

1224
01:23:14.248 --> 01:23:15.415
Cool it!

1225
01:23:16.582 --> 01:23:18.165
Let's stay focused.

1226
01:23:25.332 --> 01:23:26.910
Hello dear colleagues!

1227
01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.202
I don't believe this. Get lost!

1228
01:23:29.332 --> 01:23:30.827
Kitchen's that way, boys!

1229
01:23:30.957 --> 01:23:32.493
You know we love you.

1230
01:23:32.623 --> 01:23:35.160
I have a husband and four sons.

1231
01:23:35.290 --> 01:23:36.660
I only have male dogs.

1232
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:39.165
I'm not your enemy.

1233
01:23:39.623 --> 01:23:40.998
- Hello.
- I know you!


1234
01:23:41.832 --> 01:23:43.040
Hi, colleague.

1235
01:23:43.582 --> 01:23:45.993
Poor kid. Nothing better to do?

1236
01:23:46.123 --> 01:23:48.118
Not much going on?

1237
01:23:48.248 --> 01:23:49.952
Yes! He's getting married.

1238
01:23:50.082 --> 01:23:53.618
Does the lucky woman know
you're a militant?


1239
01:23:53.748 --> 01:23:56.202
Ask her. It's Alexandra.

1240
01:23:56.332 --> 01:23:59.415
Some women are more open-minded
than others.


1241
01:23:59.748 --> 01:24:02.827
So much so she's already married
to a lovely man.


1242
01:24:02.957 --> 01:24:04.040
Didn't you know?

1243
01:24:05.873 --> 01:24:07.082
Oops, I goofed.

1244
01:24:11.748 --> 01:24:12.832
Are you ok?

1245
01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.373
Wait! Stop!

1246
01:24:38.457 --> 01:24:39.952
Alexandra, open up!

1247
01:24:40.082 --> 01:24:41.082
Open up!

1248
01:24:54.498 --> 01:24:55.540
Hello.

1249
01:24:57.748 --> 01:25:00.243
Hello Mr. Martel. 
I forgot my key.

1250
01:25:00.373 --> 01:25:01.785
I can't give it to you.

1251
01:25:01.915 --> 01:25:03.998
You see me every day with her!

1252
01:25:04.498 --> 01:25:06.623
I mind my own business.

1253
01:25:08.748 --> 01:25:11.498
I ran out for soap
and left the bath running.


1254
01:25:12.373 --> 01:25:13.457
Don't cry.

1255
01:25:19.123 --> 01:25:20.577
Bring it back, ok?

1256
01:25:20.707 --> 01:25:22.998
Us guys gotta stick together.

1257
01:25:46.207 --> 01:25:49.082
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

1258
01:26:13.748 --> 01:26:15.082
Hi!

1259
01:26:16.082 --> 01:26:17.082
You've grown!

1260
01:26:17.248 --> 01:26:18.623
I'll get my jacket.

1261
01:26:19.290 --> 01:26:20.410
The door, Alice!

1262
01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:21.998
The dog'll get out.

1263
01:26:23.873 --> 01:26:25.702
Sudden urge to see your kid?

1264
01:26:25.832 --> 01:26:27.202
Hello Alexandre.

1265
01:26:27.332 --> 01:26:30.118
Since I'm here,
I'll tell you I filed for divorce.


1266
01:26:30.248 --> 01:26:32.248
This time you won't refuse.

1267
01:26:32.748 --> 01:26:34.665
I don't want to talk to you.

1268
01:26:46.623 --> 01:26:49.707
Come on.

1269
01:26:53.165 --> 01:26:54.248
Good evening.

1270
01:26:56.248 --> 01:26:57.285
Good afternoon.

1271
01:26:57.415 --> 01:27:02.160
I gave your key to that tall bulky guy.
Hope that's ok.


1272
01:27:02.290 --> 01:27:03.118
Damien?

1273
01:27:03.248 --> 01:27:06.827
That's fine. You did the right thing.

1274
01:27:06.957 --> 01:27:08.665
Is dinner for three ok?

1275
01:27:09.373 --> 01:27:11.082
That's nice.

1276
01:27:20.207 --> 01:27:22.623
I'll order pizza. 
Wait here for me.

1277
01:27:23.373 --> 01:27:24.415
What?

1278
01:27:24.748 --> 01:27:26.082
No way!

1279
01:27:26.998 --> 01:27:28.165
I'm going home.

1280
01:27:28.498 --> 01:27:30.827
It's always the same crap with you.

1281
01:27:30.957 --> 01:27:32.498
You'll never change.

1282
01:27:36.123 --> 01:27:40.623
I'M NOT AN EASY MAN

1283
01:27:48.248 --> 01:27:49.415
Leave him alone, girls!

1284
01:27:49.707 --> 01:27:51.082
We just wanna talk.

1285
01:27:51.623 --> 01:27:52.827
I don't want any trouble.

1286
01:27:52.957 --> 01:27:55.452
He's sad. We need to cheer him up.

1287
01:27:55.582 --> 01:27:58.457
Maybe I'm looking for trouble.

1288
01:28:00.165 --> 01:28:02.207
I remember your pineapple panties.

1289
01:28:03.665 --> 01:28:05.915
Trouble's calling my name.

1290
01:28:10.457 --> 01:28:11.623
Maybe that's him.

1291
01:28:16.082 --> 01:28:17.248
Hi, Erica.

1292
01:28:19.207 --> 01:28:20.207
Shit.

1293
01:28:21.873 --> 01:28:23.368
I couldn't reach him.

1294
01:28:23.498 --> 01:28:24.498
Who is it?

1295
01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:25.915
What's going on?

1296
01:28:26.832 --> 01:28:29.123
I'm on my way.

1297
01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:32.827
Damien's drunk,

1298
01:28:32.957 --> 01:28:34.910
some rough gals are hassling him. I'm off.

1299
01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:38.748
Don't worry,
she handles lushes all the time.


1300
01:28:39.082 --> 01:28:40.785
Then why'd she call me?

1301
01:28:40.915 --> 01:28:43.373
I'll come with you, darling. Sibyl?

1302
01:28:44.248 --> 01:28:46.743
I don't want to
leave Stan all by himself.

1303
01:28:46.873 --> 01:28:48.623
Forget it.

1304
01:28:49.165 --> 01:28:50.415
Want my mace?

1305
01:28:50.665 --> 01:28:51.665
Lolo's got this!

1306
01:28:51.790 --> 01:28:53.160
- Keep cool.
- Right.


1307
01:28:53.290 --> 01:28:56.748
Look who's here. 
Thanks for everything.

1308
01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:59.368
We're getting Damien. 
He's in trouble.

1309
01:28:59.498 --> 01:29:01.827
What sort of trouble?

1310
01:29:01.957 --> 01:29:02.957
I dunno.

1311
01:29:04.832 --> 01:29:06.082
I'll beat 'em up.

1312
01:29:10.665 --> 01:29:12.082
You want it, don't ya?

1313
01:29:14.123 --> 01:29:15.285
You ain't so young.

1314
01:29:15.415 --> 01:29:16.577
What are you doing?

1315
01:29:16.707 --> 01:29:18.373
No, wait! Stop.

1316
01:29:20.998 --> 01:29:24.290
You're hurting me. Stop!

1317
01:29:25.832 --> 01:29:26.660
Where is he?

1318
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:29.123
In the bathroom. 
He looked woozy.

1319
01:29:30.415 --> 01:29:32.373
You think it's funny?

1320
01:29:36.998 --> 01:29:37.998
Stop!

1321
01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:39.832
Lolo!

1322
01:29:40.623 --> 01:29:42.332
Stop, darling!

1323
01:29:44.748 --> 01:29:47.873
Hands off her, bitch!

1324
01:29:48.373 --> 01:29:49.498
I'll kill you!

1325
01:29:50.415 --> 01:29:51.748
Call the cops!

1326
01:29:54.248 --> 01:29:55.248
What happened?

1327
01:29:57.165 --> 01:29:57.993
Come here.

1328
01:29:58.123 --> 01:29:59.952
Stay away from me.

1329
01:30:00.082 --> 01:30:01.535
- What's wrong?
- Leave me.


1330
01:30:01.665 --> 01:30:03.493
- Are you crazy?
- Leave me alone!


1331
01:30:03.623 --> 01:30:06.285
I'm crazy like all
the guys you toy with.

1332
01:30:06.415 --> 01:30:08.082
I know everything, you bitch.

1333
01:30:08.415 --> 01:30:10.332
Come on, I can explain.

1334
01:30:10.915 --> 01:30:12.915
- Come on.
- Hands off!


1335
01:30:13.582 --> 01:30:14.707
Listen to me.

1336
01:30:15.707 --> 01:30:17.785
Yes, I lied to you.

1337
01:30:17.915 --> 01:30:20.202
I recorded our conversations
day and night.


1338
01:30:20.332 --> 01:30:21.743
- I did that.
- What?


1339
01:30:21.873 --> 01:30:24.077
I wrote that trashy book about us.

1340
01:30:24.207 --> 01:30:25.207
But it's over.

1341
01:30:25.248 --> 01:30:26.577
You did what?

1342
01:30:26.707 --> 01:30:28.452
I was lost, I had writer's block

1343
01:30:28.582 --> 01:30:31.243
then you came along
and things started again,


1344
01:30:31.373 --> 01:30:33.165
but I got all mixed up.

1345
01:30:33.915 --> 01:30:35.868
What did you do?

1346
01:30:35.998 --> 01:30:37.540
What have you done?

1347
01:30:37.748 --> 01:30:40.040
What did you write about me?

1348
01:30:40.290 --> 01:30:41.118
Nothing!

1349
01:30:41.248 --> 01:30:43.118
What have you done?

1350
01:30:43.248 --> 01:30:45.415
I love you, Damien! Stop it!

1351
01:30:48.498 --> 01:30:51.373
- I even filed for divorce.
- Shut up!


1352
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:07.285
PARAMEDICS

1353
01:31:07.415 --> 01:31:08.623
Can you hear me?

1354
01:31:15.665 --> 01:31:17.373
Are you hurt somewhere?

1355
01:31:21.623 --> 01:31:23.373
You're in an ambulance.

1356
01:31:24.207 --> 01:31:25.957
Open your eyes.

1357
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:28.207
What's going on?

1358
01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.160
You're with us.

1359
01:31:31.290 --> 01:31:33.040
Don't try to get up.

1360
01:31:34.457 --> 01:31:35.702
Let me out.

1361
01:31:35.832 --> 01:31:37.243
Please, be sensible.

1362
01:31:37.373 --> 01:31:39.410
- Lie down.
- Let's strap her in.


1363
01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:41.248
Open the door right now!

1364
01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:42.957
Open the door!

1365
01:31:43.373 --> 01:31:44.832
Another hysterical woman.

1366
01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:15.748
Hello, Miss.

1367
01:33:18.498 --> 01:33:19.832
A beer, please.

1368
01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:53.243
Stand together, fight the fight!

1369
01:33:53.373 --> 01:33:56.873
Women of the world unite!

1370
01:34:21.707 --> 01:34:22.707
RESIST

1371
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:25.535
WOMEN IN THE STREETS
THE PATRIARCHY IS PISSING ITSELF


1372
01:34:25.665 --> 01:34:27.535
SEXISTS, WE'RE WATCHING YOU

1373
01:34:27.665 --> 01:34:29.623
HANDS OFF MY PUSSY

1374
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:33.248
MEN AND WOMEN
MAKING CHANGE TOGETHER


1375
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:35.915
Alexandra!

1376
01:34:36.748 --> 01:34:37.915
Alexandra!
