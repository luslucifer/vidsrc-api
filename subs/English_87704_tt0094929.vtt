In the web between the index finger

Symptoms: Loss of consciousness,
convulsing, fever, vomiting.


688
01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:19.942
Diagnosis: The neurotoxins
contained in this venom


689
01:01:19.943 --> 01:01:24.071
encountered
the immune system's t-cells,


690
01:01:24.072 --> 01:01:28.993
replacing and invading the genetic
code of the patient's forearm,

modifying its structure.

Cause: Unknown.

Hypothesis:

694
01:01:42.841 --> 01:01:44.466
Like some fungi,

695
01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:49.138
this particular venom
must have symbiotic properties.

Infected by the neurotoxins,

697
01:01:51.433 --> 01:01:55.102
the immune system's t-cells
do not die,

and allow it to replicate.

it's the lord's business.
